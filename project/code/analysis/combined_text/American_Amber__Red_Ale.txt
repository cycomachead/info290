12
oz
can
poured
into
a
shaker
smells
buttery
and
earthy
has
some
faint
hoppy
spicy
aroma
sneaking
in
on
the
backend
but
the
sweetness
definitely
dominates
pours
hazy
on
the
orange
side
of
amber
with
a
thick
and
foamy
eggshellcolored
head
lacing
is
a
bit
uneven
both
large
and
small
lace
is
present
the
taste
is
medium
caramel
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
swallow
theres
also
a
citrus
presence
throughout
the
drink
but
i
cant
quite
place
it
another
review
mentioned
grapefruit
which
seems
fair
relatively
light
body
considering
the
caramel
malty
flavoring
which
finishes
creamy
smooth
with
very
little
if
any
carbonation
however
some
of
the
hoppiness
sticks
around
at
the
finish
not
overwhelming
like
some
ipas
but
the
faint
thin
grassy
coating
of
the
mouth
is
reminiscent
in
fact
depending
on
food
pairings
it
may
be
beneficial
theres
an
interesting
cheesy
flavor
think
aged
parmesan
that
pops
up
about
mid
drink
as
it
begins
to
warms
im
still
relatively
undecided
on
it
but
it
does
give
this
beer
a
uniqueness
to
it
wow
this
one
blew
me
away
amazing
hop
aroma
bright
ambergolden
color
a
little
light
for
an
amber
but
thats
hardly
a
knock
bitterness
is
spot
on
for
the
abv
and
malt
character
fantastic
pours
with
a
large
foamy
head
over
a
dark
amber
body
strngly
hoppy
with
moderate
bitterness
relatively
dark
and
large
malt
load
im
a
big
fan
of
the
sixpoint
brews
especially
ones
like
this
one
waves
of
malt
and
then
dense
hops
all
over
the
rear
great
cool
to
cold
weather
brew
complex
and
quite
tasty
dandilion
and
citrus
summer
brew
thats
heavier
than
most
taste
isnt
bad
but
smell
is
much
better
pours
an
orange
amber
with
finger
thick
white
head
smells
of
orange
blossom
orange
rind
an
sweet
malts
tastes
of
tangerine
sweet
malts
rye
barley
grapefruit
and
bready
mediumlight
body
sweet
malts
some
orange
and
pine
aftertaste
really
good
this
year
id
rather
have
a
warmer
than
a
nugget
nectar
in
2015
not
really
bold
enough
for
an
imperial
red
label
put
that
aside
and
it
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
rated
this
as
an
imperial
red
because
thats
what
it
says
on
the
package
as
far
as
imp
reds
go
this
one
is
soft
and
not
hoppy
enough
if
i
rated
it
as
an
amber
ale
the
score
would
have
been
higher
regardless
of
the
ramifications
of
the
style
conundrum
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
first
imperial
red
nicely
hopped
good
solid
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
had
smooth
balanced
and
refreshing
a
very
good
hop
forward
big
red
seek
it
out
poured
a
copper
body
with
one
finger
head
and
lace
ring
down
glass
a
mostly
citric
hop
aroma
with
touches
of
malty
sweetness
like
caramel
but
more
hoppy
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
is
balanced
as
is
my
preference
with
even
hops
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
although
it
does
finish
a
little
dry
with
soapy
hops
overall
very
good
brew
definitely
a
keeper
during
the
season
in
your
fridge
i
wouldnt
hunt
the
world
looking
for
it
but
definitely
give
it
a
go
salud
a
very
good
beer
from
a
can
i
would
recommend
and
have
another
smooth
red
ale
went
down
easy
fantastic
very
smooth
love
the
hops
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
there
is
nothing
great
about
it
for
me
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
thing
its
a
little
bit
on
the
gratuitously
hoppy
side
which
makes
a
like
of
what
might
otherwise
be
incredibly
interesting
subtle
notes
mostly
disappear
but
over
all
still
quite
nice
dark
orange
to
reddish
color
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
with
a
two
finger
frothy
head
and
good
lacing
the
odor
is
ipa
like
citrus
mandarin
orange
tropical
fruits
pineapple
mango
pine
resin
rose
floral
violets
the
taste
is
floral
rose
pine
resin
grapefruit
malty
bitter
throughout
o
a
very
flavorful
amber
that
packs
a
solid
hop
flavor
for
the
style
higher
abv
comes
out
as
the
full
flavor
somehow
reminds
me
of
the
vivant
big
red
coq
which
a
goto
given
a
renewed
availability
in
mi
i
could
see
buying
a
bunch
a
very
solid
brew
unexpectedly
hoppy
beer
for
me
in
a
cool
can
malt
could
be
more
assertive
but
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
7
abv
hop
bomb
overall
a
very
solid
offering
planning
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
these
if
there
was
a
bit
more
malt
backbone
to
chew
on
this
would
have
been
perfect
but
still
a
nice
beer
a
unique
take
on
either
a
winter
ale
or
an
amber
ale
while
hop
forward
it
is
quite
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
a
little
hop
bitterness
it
is
not
a
malt
bomb
like
many
ambers
or
festooned
with
massively
citrusy
hops
like
so
many
brewers
are
using
these
days
while
its
abv
kinda
rules
it
out
as
a
session
beer
the
combination
of
unique
but
enjoyable
flavor
and
lower
impact
on
the
palate
makes
it
way
more
refreshing
than
i
expected
i
wouldnt
mind
having
several
of
these
so
long
as
im
at
home
or
not
driving
the
hop
character
plays
up
more
so
in
the
taste
leaving
a
decently
balanced
lingering
finish
with
the
toasty
malts
super
tasty
hoppy
red
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
overly
spiced
winter
brews
a
can
received
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
lets
just
say
i
didnt
finish
the
can
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
dont
know
if
i
could
really
call
this
a
red
i
wish
it
had
more
caramel
notes
it
is
more
of
an
ipa
nonetheless
it
was
still
a
pretty
good
beer
not
the
best
red
out
there
but
by
no
means
bad
pours
red
as
ever
with
a
smooth
taste
id
recommend
as
i
enjoy
sixpoint
but
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
again
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
pretty
bland
and
a
hop
taste
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
a
very
good
ipa
with
smooth
finish
very
average
tasted
stronger
than
the

too
create
a

there
is
some

as
well
which
adds
some
spice
and
some
delayed
heat
on
the

it
fakes
you
out

the
nose
on
this
one
is
great
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
for
the
style
the
taste
is
a
little
one
dimensional
i
was
looking
for
a
little
malt
to
balance
the
hops
somewhere
it
is
enjoyable
but
there
are
ipas
that
are
a
bit
more
multidimentional
bringing
flowers
or
fruit
etc
another
impressive
beer
from
sixpoint
o
not
sure
how
this
falls
under
the
amberred
category
not
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
as
i
would
expect
from
that
category
drinks
more
like
a
pale
ale
or
an
ipa
sixpoint
website
says
this
beer
cant
be
classified
i
guess
this
is
proof
of
that
at
any
rate
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
thats
all
that
matters
impressive
o
another
one
bites
the
dust
probably
one
of
the
better
hoppy
beers
from
sixpoint
the
flavor
is
far
more
hoppy
giving
this
a
long
biting
aftertaste
more
ipa
than
red
ale
good
crystal
malt
flavored
base
rich
body
but
with
an
equally
elevated
carbonation
level
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
this
is
a
good
beer
it
would
easily
be
a
new
favorite
if
it
had
a
bit
more
body
and
sweetness
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
the
humboldt
red
nectar
which
i
think
has
some
of
the
things
that
are
missing
here
final
score
3
84
overall
drinkability
not
bad
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
amberred
ale
as
the
hops
are
so
dominant
and
i
didnt
think
the
color
was
that
seasonably
red
nicely
drinkable
if
youre
a
hophead
but
i
suspect
others
may
tire
of
it
i
found
one
to
be
enough
per
evening
not
a
terrible
beer
however
there
is
something
about
the
balance
that
bothers
me
other
amber
ales
that
i
enjoyed
had
a
toasted
malt
quality
that
was
sweet
but
well
balanced
against
the
hops
in
this
beer
i
feel
that
the
hops
bitterness
overpowers
the
other
tastes
i
associate
with
amber
ales
although
i
would
not
rule
out
buying
this
one
again
im
not
so
enthusiastic
i
love
six
point
brewerys
products
however
this
one
is
my
least
favorite
so
far
aroma
is
dank
resiny
and
a
touch
citrusy
but
the
cannabis
rules
the
day
flavor
reveals
more
muddled
fruity
hop
flavoring
which
rests
on
a
dank
bed
of
hops
that
becomes
substantially
bitter
at
the
finish
im
not
a
bitter
fan
so
too
much
for
my
liking
pours
a
dark
copper
with
am
amber
hue
and
an
off
white
head
aroma
grounded
with
biscuit
and
toffee
maybe
even
a
little
chocolate
paired
with
some
floral
citrus
and
pine
from
the
hops
flavor
follows
suit
overall
love
this
beer
second
only
to
odells
runoff
red
when
it
comes
to
favorite
hoppy
reds
now
i
just
got
to
try
some
nugget
nectar
d
this
was
an
interesting
beer
the
scent
was
nice
but
the
taste
wasnt
as
good
and
the
body
was
fairly
weak
the
finish
was
smooth
enough
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
just
not
very
rewarding
i
love
these
little
cans
from
sixpoint
its
a
nice
dose
of
beer
like
this
one
which
is
a
hopped
up
winter
warmer
type
with
a
big
more
layers
to
it
than
most
and
none
of
the
usually
uncomfortable
palate
of
spices
that
dominate
the
style
glowing
almost
bright
red
orangey
but
loud
in
looks
with
a
ton
of
tiny
bubbles
scurrying
around
in
an
inch
of
white
head
as
soft
as
a
feather
pillow
a
nose
of
citrusy
hops
almost
as
spice
in
place
of
spice
on
top
of
a
nice
amber
malt
body
which
flirts
with
red
ale
and
barleywine
in
aroma
and
in
taste
its
bigger
but
the
hops
interrupt
its
sweetness
at
exactly
the
right
time
for
me
a
needed
respite
from
what
i
feared
would
be
an
onslaught
of
residual
sugar
but
thats
just
not
the
case
much
softer
all
around
than
expected
and
balanced
as
they
come
i
dont
miss
spices
at
all
in
this
and
appreciate
the
use
of
hops
in
that
role
a
very
drinkable
beer
too
for
what
it
is
the
effervescent
carbonation
sure
helps
that
but
its
somehow
refreshing
too
not
a
trait
i
usually
ascribe
to
winter
warmers
but
i
dig
this
another
unique
and
highly
agreeable
brew
from
these
guys
they
would
look
great
on
colorado
shelves
pours
a
hazy
barely
translucent
golden
with
a
thick
and
finebubbled
buff
head
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
with
a
caramel
and
malty
undertone
flavor
is
resiny
and
hoppy
more
like
an
ipa
with
malty
and
caramel
underpinnings
texture
is
firm
smooth
and
lively
prepare
for
the
effects
of
global
warming
with
this
brewski
o
this
was
pretty
tasty
a
big
beer
that
remains
fairly
easy
to
drink
bitterness
and
dankness
are
the
predominant
impressions
but
the
beer
is
pretty
put
together
well
recommended
o
a
very
interesting
beer
with
some
things
to
like
and
some
things
that
are
a
bit
offputting
definitely
try
this
when
you
are
in
an
offcentered
mood
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
sixpoint
this
beer
seems
to
fall
somewhere
in
between
an
amber
ale
and
american
barley
wine
aggressive
hops
with
strong
citrus
notes
of
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
a
light
resin
are
well
balanced
by
maltier
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
well
structured
and
enjoyable
beer
poured
straight
down
the
middle
of
a
large
tulip
style
glass
it
resulted
in
a
massive
three
finger
head
after
a
couple
of
minutes
the
appearance
had
died
down
to
a
thick
fluffy
cap
with
heavy
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
appearance
is
a
deep
hazy
amber
orange
with
more
suspended
particulate
floating
around
in
there
than
in
just
about
any
beer
ive
ever
seen
i
actually
poured
a
second
to
see
if
it
was
just
one
can
but
the
same
held
true
in
this
case
as
well
looking
at
other
beeradvocate
reviews
this
seems
the
norm
for
this
beer
am
i
expecting
too
much
for
a
beer
that
costs
over
10
for
4pack
to
actually
pour
clear
oh
well
nose
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
candied
nuts
with
strong
hop
notes
of
potent
ganja
and
hints
of
spruce
and
pine
needles
sip
is
hop
forward
at
first
with
a
hint
of
caramel
followed
by
big
piney
and
grass
flavors
on
top
of
the
bitter
notes
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
midpalate
also
sees
candied
orange
and
ripe
apricot
orange
zest
mango
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
very
very
light
bready
notes
back
of
the
tongue
and
swallow
see
more
uniform
and
onedimensional
dry
tannins
the
finish
has
hints
of
peach
jam
mandarin
oranges
and
piney
grapefruit
hop
bitters
with
notes
of
lavender
one
of
the
defining
things
about
this
beer
for
me
is
the
mouthfeel
which
has
a
wonderfully
effervescent
quality
its
not
so
much
that
it
is
overly
carbonated
so
much
as
it
is
the
way
the
carbonation
feels
on
the
tongue
in
some
ways
it
reminds
me
of
the
feeling
of
a
lambrusco
all
in
all
this
is
yet
another
exceptional
beer
from
sixpoint
yes
im
a
bit
irked
by
the
particulate
but
in
the
end
if
the
flavor
mouthfeel
and
aroma
are
all
terrific
and
i
dont
get
sick
from
whatever
is
floating
in
the
beer
then
im
a
very
forgiving
soul
marketed
somewhat
as
a
winter
warmer
this
is
also
another
example
of
sixpoint
refusing
to
play
by
expected
stylistic
rules
in
this
case
because
its
not
really
a
winter
warmer
in
the
traditional
sense
instead
think
of
this
as
a
wonderfully
hoppy
amber
ale
somewhat
akin
to
nugget
nectar
albeit
less
sweet
more
bitter
and
not
quite
as
good
which
is
not
so
much
a
knock
against
global
warmer
so
much
as
it
is
a
testament
to
how
much
i
love
nugget
nectar
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
hue
with
a
fluffy
three
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
piney
hopscitruscaramel
candy
and
toasted
maltsthe
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
with
a
big
hit
of
citrus
first
up
followed
by
boiled
candy
and
toffee
finished
with
a
big
dose
of
piney
bitter
hops
and
overall
its
not
out
of
this
world
but
quite
sessionable
cheers
o
not
bad
but
whatever
i
cant
exactly
describe
is
slightly
offputting
and
takes
it
down
a
couple
notches
in
my
book
o
very
solid
big
red
i
always
enjoy
this
style
no
complaints
about
this
one
quite
good
grab
a
can
o
this
is
a
win
for
six
point
and
they
have
been
making
some
great
beer
i
have
passed
them
by
but
have
started
giving
them
a
chance
and
have
not
been
disappointed
overall
not
sure
i
would
categorized
this
as
a
red
ale
but
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
oa
well
made
amber
ale
the
hops
are
there
and
are
pleasant
but
this
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
nugget
nectar
overall
not
bad
nice
big
hop
profile
and
malt
balance
but
they
both
seem
to
eventually
unbalance
each
other
and
both
get
a
little
unwelcome
o
this
is
my
idea
of
a
winter
warmer
more
bitter
than
an
ideal
esb
or
english
bitter
but
in
that
ballpark
delivering
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
flavor
none
of
the
cinnamon
or
other
strong
spice
notes
which
are
a
signature
of
so
many
american
winter
warmers
but
thats
fine

me

i
thought
this
might
be
a

like
some
of
the
winter
warmers
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
good
pale
ale
not
as
malty
as
some
of
the
winter
type
beers
i
would
like
this
any
time
a
year
but
think
it
might
be
a
better
summer
beer
overall
very
drinkable
at
7
abv
and
carries
just
the
right
flavor
profile
for
a
winter
brew
might
be
a
bit
pricey
for
a
4pack
of
12
ouncers
but
you
wouldnt
go
wrong
buying
it
serving
type
on
tap
served
in
a
tulip
glass
global
warmer
isnt
the
kind
of
winter
seasonal
thatll
help
defrost
your
fingers
after
braving
the
elements
if
anything
its
better
suited
for
poolside
consumption
than
fireplace
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
hops
at
all
times
of
the
year
and
nothing
can
brighten
up
a
dreary
winter
night
like
tropical
hops
but
as
i
look
out
my
window
and
watch
the
snow
fall
the
wind
gust
and
the
frost
build
up
this
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
t
id
have
it
again
im
a
pretty
big
sixpoint
fan
and
this
is
good
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
better
offerings
of
the
brewry
bengali
and
diesel
im
looking
at
you
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
since
i
was
expecting
a
malty
ale
from
the
warmer
in
the
title
it
was
a
very
nice
hoppy
surprise
that
went
down
smooth
and
was
full
of
flavor
another
winner
from
sixpoint
this
one
was
another
treat
o
what
can
i
say
sixpoint
fucking
rocks
this
beer
has
all
the
great
redamber
ipa
mixes
lots
of
sweet
malts
and
body
tons
of
citrus
hops
just
another
damn
fine
sixpoint
brew
i
would
like
more
of
this
get
this
if
you
can
find
still
find
it
otherwise
put
it
on
your
list
for
next
winter
surprisingly
complex
and
interesting
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
my
only
grip
is
that
it
came
in
a
4
pack
of
12
oz
cans
instead
of
the
16
oz
cans
that
most
other
sixpoint
beers
usually
come
in
good
hoppy
ipa
spicy
profile
fits
well
with
the
holiday
release
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
ambers
and
while
this
is
better
than
most
it
still
has
some
of
the
malt
characteristics
of
an
amber
that
make
this
a
style
i
tend
not
to
approach
very
often
smelled
like
an
ipa
when
i
opened
it
and
left
me
a
bit
surprised
delivers
a
nice
amount
of
hops
with
just
enough
malt
base
to
balance
and
keep
it
in
the
amber
ale
side
of
things
solid
all
around
and
worth
a
try
for
anyone
o
this
tastes
like
a
dipa
to
me
but
regardless
of
style
its
tasty
just
a
bit
monotone
overall
its
a
damn
fine
winter
warmer
certainly
an
enjoyable
treat
for
the
cold
weather
and
holidays
this
was
an
interesting
beer
mostly
because
with
the
descriptions
i
read
and
then
with
what
i
thought
while
drinking
it
i
had
a
hard
time
deciding
what
style
this
beer
actually
was
it
says
on
the
can
that
it
is
a
winter
warmer
which
would
make
me
think
it
is
some
kind
of
scotch
ale
it
is
classified
on
this
website
as
an
amber
ale
when
i
tasted
it
i
thought
more
ipa
since
the
taste
was
very
hoppy
and
their
was
some
citrus
presence
whatever
style
this
beer
wants
to
be
though
it
was
very
drinkable
and
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
leaves
a
little
residue
on
the
tongue
definitely
a
dry
finish
o
a
decent
ipa
i
know
the
website
calls
it
an
imperial
red
and
its
listed
on
ba
as
an
amberred
ale
but
cmon
who
we
kidding
i
tasted
the
hints
of
the
red
ale
base
but
the
hops
overpowered
the
dry
toasted
caramel
found
in
a
normal
red
ale
the
large
chunks
of
sediment
were
a
turnoff
tastetoasted
malt
big
shot
of
dusty
citrus
hops
lots
of
tasty
flavor
in
a
smalllooking
can
a
hophead
thumbsup
overall
a
rather
tasty
red
ipa
with
a
nice
blend
of
grapefruit
and
pine
hop
mixed
with
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
a
nice
drinker
overall
o
not
what
i
expected
at
all
but
after
having
many
of
their
other
brews
im
pretty
confident
that
sixpoint
has
a
mantra
like
three
floyds
every
style
can
become
an
ipa
if
you
try
hard
enough
but
you
know
what
these
guys
have
a
little
more
finesse
when
it
comes
to
all
things
hop
i
get
a
more
herbal
nuanced
flavors
from
their
beers
maybe
its
because
sixpoint
doesnt
overload
their
hoppy
beers
with
an
extrasweet
dose
of
malt
like
fff
but
thats
beside
the
pointi
love
both
brewers
and
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
keep
em
coming
sixpoint
o
a
very
solid
winter
beer
here
from
sixpoint
definitely
more
ipa
than
winter
warmer
to
me
and
thats
how
i
like
it
definitely
worth
a
try
atmosphere
is
really
nice
substantial
head
tons
of
persistent
lacing
nose
is
pungent
bitter
and
a
little
sweet
bitter
nuttiness
grains
are
very
pungent
accentuated
with
citrus
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
i
like
the
idea
of
a
very
flavorful
hoppy
beer
as
a
holiday
choice
as
opposed
to
a
spiced
beer
well
done
as
always
six
point
judging
on
the
expectation
of
an
imperial
red
id
have
to
say
i
see
no
resemblance
but
based
on
its
own
merit
i
find
this
exceptional
12
ounce
can
best
before
27
mar

served
in
a
pint

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangeamber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
lot
of

left
behind
on
the
glass
the
brew
smells
like
citrusy
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
herbal
hops
bready
malt
and
some
caramel
i
think
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
light
piney
hops
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
with
moderate

i
thought
it
was
a
good
hoppy
brew

a
4pack
poured
to
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
off
white
head
with
great
retention
and

appearance
was
hazy
with
an
amber
honey
color
aroma
was
maly
and
sweet
with
with
floral
and
citrus
notes
taste
had
some
nice
hoppy
notes
with
hints
of
citrus
and
a
little
spice
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
o
wish
i
had
this
a
bit
fresher
but
overall
its
pretty
solid
the
nose
is
really
weak
but
the
taste
is
just
nice
and
juicy
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
serving
type
can
hoppier
than
i
though
itd
be
a
nice
blast
of
pine
with
a
dry
finish
on
a
moderately
malty
base
without
too
much
residual
sugar
christmas
beer
in
the
style
of
sierra
celebration
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
fairly
silky
in
the
mouth
and
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
finish
but
deftly
done
i
dont
know
if
those
are
actual
spices
or
just
some
spiciness
from
the
hop
blend
either
way
it
adds
another
dimension
to
the
beer
well
done
i
enjoyed
this
on
a
chilly
day
o
good
stuff
as
always
from
sixpoint
more
of
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
but
call
it
what
you
will
a
pretty
good
beer
non
the
less
would
need
a
lot
more
malt
to
stand
up
to
the
hops
to
really
call
it
an
amber
ale
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
i
can
relate
it
to
a
true
imperial
amber
giant
id
say
that
it
wants
to
be
a
troegs
nugget
nectar
when
it
grows
up
a
nice
winter
warmer
without
all
of
the
spices
and
heavy
sweetness
great
for
those
who
prefer
hops
over
malt
this
time
of
year
or
anytime
of
year
for
that
matter
sharp
cheddar
or
a
tasty
bleu
cheese
would
pair
a
moderately
hoppy
and
bitter
red
ale
rather
thin
but
goes
down
easy
overalla
nice
and
hoppy
floral
red
i
got
a
distinct
bit
of
salt
at
the
end
of
this
which
was
a
nice
change
outside
of
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
above
average
but
nothing
i
would
rush
out
to
get
again
d
a
solid
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
ive
been
satisfied
or
impressed
with
every
beer
ive
tried
from
sixpoint
i
am
simply
enamored
of
these
new
slimline
cans
they
are
stylish
they
allow
more
shelf
placement
and
for
hatas
it
does
not
look
like
i
am
drinking
beer
but
red
bull
or
somesuch
instead
the
crack
was
anything
but
slim
emitting
a
loud
noise
and
revealing
yet
another
brimful
can
an
inverted
glug
was
easy
to
accomplish
and
i
quickly
had
to
back
off
lest
i
have
overflow
the
threeplus
fingers
of
dense
rocky
lighttan
head
with
great

looked
like
a

was
a

cool
once
more
i
had
some

as
the
head
fell

was

and
i
could
imagine
myself
in
a
snowy
pine
forest
by
closing
my
eyes
warm
ha
the
70
ibus
had
a
warming
impact
on
my
tongue
however
this
was
one
hoppy
winter
warmer
ill
tell
you
that
said
i
am
not
complaining
i
have
partaken
of
a
number
of
beers
in
the
style
which
were

my

little
too
sweet
but
ok
o
easy
to
drink
flavor
wasnt
all
that
complex
i
liked
that
there
was
more
bittering
hops
than
in
most
ambers
overall
a
pretty
good
american
amber
red
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
come
across
it
almost
as
good
or
comparable
to
red

lots
and

the

the

it
reminds

of
a
well
hopped
wee
heavy
prretty
good
id
have
another
overall
a
good
beer
to
play
beer

with

and
a

over
carbonated

apart
from
that
a
smooth
bubbly
feel
whoah
really
aromatic
pungent
spicy
and
hoppy
tastes
great
better
than
red

o
this
is
one
of
those
times
im
glad
i
picked
out
a
beer
other
than
the
one
i
was
intending
to
buy
too
hoppy
to
call
this
refreshing
but
certainly
sessionable
this
beer
with
half
the
ibus
would
be
off
the
charts
why
force
the
bitterness
in
there
north
coast
flavors
are
amazing
in
this
one
this
hits
the
spot
like
nobodys
business
the
malt
provides
a
good
softening
background
for
the
reasonably
intense
hops
which
are
pleasantly
bitter
and
citrusy

this

and
leaves
on
the
slightest
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
malty
but
nondescript
with
a
light
funky
earthy
quality
the
taste
is
deeper
with
the
malt
with
some
darker
fruit
notes
and
caramel
malt
breadiness
theres
a
nice
moderate
weight
to
the
body
and
overall
this
is
a
goodtovery
good
red
ale
that
doesnt
blow
you
away
but
is
very
well
made
overall
slightly
above
average
pale
ale
more
hop
characteristics
would
have
been
nice
based
on
what
the
label
says
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
amberred
ale
which
meets
the
style
characteristics
quite
well
the
malt
is
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
but
just
right
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
one
i
could
drink
all
day
o
i
always
find
myself
trying
to
pair
light
yet
flavorful
beers
with
foods
this
beer
should
be
your
type
o
it
goes
with
anything
fact
you
could
drink
this
at
the
tailgate
or
with
a
fantastic
filet
and
no
one
would
be
upset
a
true
jack
of
all
trades
completely
drinkable
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
north
coast
but
not
their
best
outing
o
this
would
make
a
fine
session
ale
but
wont
be
memorable
interesting
that
it
has
a
medium
bitterness
that
does
not
goes
away
and
both
malt
and
hops
are
melted
together
though
it
felt
a
bit
too
thin
but
this
makes
it
very
sessionable
o
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
with
now
dominant
or
overpowering
flavorsaromas
leading
me
to
believe
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
with
meals
well
balanced
and
drinkable
definitely
could
have
another
of
these
overall
pretty
good
beer
to
pair
with
food
would
drink
again
decent
brew
bitter
aftertaste
lasts
longer
than
expected
o
though
there
are
many
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
its
not
a
bad
red
ale
and
its
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
when
beginning
my
craft
beer
adventure
overall
this
wasnt
bad
i
felt
everything
was
mixed
together
very
well
but
nothing
really
seemed
to
pop
i
may
give
it
another
go
down
the
road
to
see
if
maybe
mine
had
too
much
age
on
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
enjoyable
ruedrichs
red
seal
ale
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
very
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
malty
undertone
with
lots
of
floral
hop
notes
in
the
aroma
the
taste
has
a
bold
malty
backbone
with
strong
notes
of
floral
hop
flavors
full
flavors
nice
body
overall
a
very
nice
and
hoppy
red
ale
theres
an
interaction
between
the
malt
and
bittering
hops
that
gives
the
impression
of
burnt
bread
which
is
fairly
offputting
but
the
malt
and
hop
flavor
profiles
are
nice
lots
of
floral
hop
presence
as
well
not
your
typical
west
coast
american
amber
this
beer
can
be
appreciated
by
all
beer
drinkers
wow
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
happened
here
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
hoppy
some
malts
are
present
taste
is
pure
bitterness
no
balance
at
all
no
citrus
pine
floral
notes
just
a
whole
lot
of
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
and
bitter
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
did
not
much
care
for
this
beer
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
red
ale
food
match
great
thing
about
a
balanced
beer
is
that
it
works
with
practically
anything
dark
meats
light
meats
salads
cheese
platters
i
would
personally
lean
towards
thai
but
thats
just
my
preference
im
a
big
fan
of
acme
pa
by
north
coast
an
this
is
just
another
brilliant
addition
to
there
list
o
a
wonderfully
balanced
beer
that
makes
for
a
refreshing
session
ale
oim
hoping
the
bottle
was
past
due
the
malt
flavors
were
ok
but
the
lack
of
balance
destroyed
the
beer
nothing
to
stand
up
and
yell
about
here
your
basic
amber
beer
bottom
line
shelf
beer
worth
your
time
o
incredibly
easy
drinking
red
ale
this
will
become
a
staple
in
the
fridge
in
a
great
tasting
lineup
this
beer
was
the
surprise
standout
o
a
great
beer
would
be
wonderful
companion
on
a
spring
picnic
overall
i
think
i
may
have
drank
this
in
the
wrong
glass
with
such
a
strong
aroma
i
should
have
had
this
in
a
tulip
it
is
an
easy
drinking
red
amber
and
i
like
the
balance
of
hops
and
malt
i
would
order
this
again
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
meal
would
have
shalom
and
again
overall
a
nice
d
red
ale
with
a
good
balance
of
hop
and
malt
a
good
drinking
brew
overall
drinkability
another
very
good
north
coast
beer
overall
i
wouldnt
consider
myself
a
hophead
especially
in
the
winter
when
i
usually
want
a
malty
beer
however
this
is
a
great
hoppy
beer
i
think
it
will
please
hopand
nonhopheads
this
is
a
solid
complex
red
ale
that
i
would
highly
recommend
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
another
winner
by
north
coast
delicious
on
the
palette
complex
hoppy
crispy
beer
with
a
balanced
malt
body
higher
carbonation
that
allows
for
a
flavorful
refreshingsavory
finish
other
flavors
present
spices
balance
the
hop
to
make
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
awhile
from
a
famous
well
respected
brewery
if
this
beer
had
7
5
abv
or
more
it
would
be
one
of
my
favorites
amazing
for
what
it
is
whole
6
pack
consumption
overall
another
brewery
with
some
decent
brew
but
nothing
extraordinary
the
stout
was
good
the
pilsener
was
okay
but
this
ale
is
hoppier
than
i
would
expect
it
to
be
its
still
decent
and
a
drinkable
brew
as
much
as
i
go
against
the
hoppy
standard
i
do
like
this
and
could
actually
do
a
few
in
succession
i
thik
that
part
alone
warrants
a
4
5
o
for
a
session
ale
this
beer
is
a
must
for
any
hop
head
if
you
just
want
a
good
hoped
up
beer
to
drink
throughout
the
week
this
one
would
also
work
only
downfall
is
the
date
for
it
being
a
beer
with
hops
and
low
abv
it
should
have
a
date
for
the
consumers
if
it
had
one
i
am
sure
i
would
have
picked
one
up
sooner
or
been
buying
it
more
regular
it
will
get
docked
for
no
date
on
the
bottle
as
is
its
a
really
good
beer
that
will
be
in
my
fridge
from
now
on
its
a
world
class
beer
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
got
a
sixpack
of
this
baby
for
the
furthur
show
last
nigh
at
red
rocks
it
poured
a
nice
red
copper
color
with
a
two
inch
white
head
the
smell
is
nice
west
coast
hops
and
red
malt
hoppy
for
a
red
ale
it
has
a
crisp
bitter
flavor
at
first
but
the
malt
mellows
the
finish
with
some
caramel
and
bready
notes
its
very
well
balanced
and
slightly
unconventional
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
too
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
intensely
carbonated
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
beer
one
of
the
better
north
coast
products
ive
had
an
excellent
concert
beer
as
well
hearty
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
nice
o
if
i
had
to
describe
it
id
call
it
a
pale
red
ale
great
balance
leaning
slightly
hopward
a
beer
ive
gone
to
multiple
times
and
have
always
been
satisfied
with
o
an
awesome
round
balanced
ale
that
does
everything
and
anything
pair
it
with
meat
fish
chicken
or
just
drink
alone
as
a
session
ale
simple
yet
complex
and
highly
recommended
overall
m
medium
vicousity
with
a
taste
that
lingers
for
a
good
20
seconds
after
a
drink
very
good
for
the
style
over
all
good
o
this
was
a
good
beer
very
refreshing
and
a
good
equal
mix
of
hops
and
malt
medium
bodied
warming
from
the
swallow
on
crisply
effervescent
though
not
overpowering
just
noticeable
a
solid
tasty
refreshing
beer
that
could
easily
fill
many
roles
overall
its
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
just
about
in
any
setting
from
watching
a
football
to
a
nice
dinner
thanks
to
its
simple
yet
enjoyable
flavor
i
remember
this
beer
very
clearly
it
was
a
mystery
beer
that
i
had
once
and
i
knew
it
was
from
california
and
i
remember
this
same
dirty
kind
of
earthen
tone
to
it
seems
a
bit
nicer
on
the
bottle
than
it
was
on
tap
as
far
as
the
earthen
tone
goes
i
mean
a
decent
amber
but
too
earthy
decent
i
liked
this
but
i
dont
see
why
it
would
be
world
class
seems
more
like
the
brewers
reputation
being
rewarded
than
the
beer
poured
a
3
custard
head
which
took
a
long
time
to
start
to
recede
but
once
it
did
lost
wind
fast
the
body
is
a
clear
deep
golden
yellow
which
is
nice
but
doesnt
at
all
look
like
an
amberred
ale
smells
mildly
of
hops
and
malt
no
surprises
taste
is
good
with
a
very
mild
butterscotch
and
mild
malt
followed
by
a
persistent
hops
finish
good
beer
overall
a
very
solid
red
ale
has
the
hop
presence
of
a
ipa
with
a
strong
malt
character
to
balance
it
very
well
overall
a
wonderful
amber
from
north
coast
really
nice
approachable
flavor
and
smoothness
overall
quite
a
smooth
and
sessional
ale
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
a
whole
heap
of
them
in
one
hit
unless
i
came
into
more
money
than
im
currently
worth
pours
a
clear
copper
golden
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
an
off
white
cap
during
effervescence
the
beers
bouquet
is
of
mild
floral
but
mostly
citrus
hops
i
love
the
greenish
tint
the
beer
has
around
its
top
edges
and
in
the
foam
as
its
being
poured
as
the
beer
settles
the
grain
presents
more
prominently
the
moutfheel
is
very
nice
smooth
wet
and
perfectly
carbonated
very
mild
flavor
light
toasted
malt
with
appealing
mild
hop
flavor
in
the
background
the
maltiness
does
eventually
succumb
to
the
citrus
hop
that
prevails
late
whats
left
in
the
finish
is
a
mild
unoffensive
hop
perfume
in
the
palate
very
good
and
drinkable
pale
ale
that
from
a
fellow
who
nearly
never
likes
malty
pale
ales
really
like
this
one
i
pick
it
up
quite
often
when
i
find
it
sitting
in
the
local
whole
foods
overall
enjoyed
it
a
lot
i
recommend
trying
this
price
point
2
25single
12oz
b
overall
i
feel
a
little
let
down
by
this
beer
as
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
malt
presence
that
aside
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
something
i
would
probably
have
again
o
this
is
a
fine
red
ale
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
looking
for
something
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
goes
down
way
too
easy
well
worth
checking
out
a
cherry
amber
appearance
with
a
thumbs
width
white
head
and
nice
lacing
a
sweet
aroma
of
toffee
and
honey
alongside
a
touch
of
floral
flavor
matches
the
aroma
quite
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
to
this
a
very
smooth
medium
body
to
this
overall
this
feels
like
it
is
toeing
the
line
between
an
amber
and
a
red
i
guess
the
hoppy
finish
to
this
makes
it
a
red
but
i
get
a
big
amber
vibe
from
this
one
otherwise
that
said
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
high
up
there
on
my
list
of
ambers
mouth
feel
is
clean
and
crisp
this
beer
is
also
pretty
smooth
throughout
o
the
amount
of
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
is
insane
and
the
malt
isnt
a
pushover
either
an
immensely
enjoyable
amber
o
great
balance
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
great
beer
on
the
shelf
it
doesnt
look
like
much
and
i
doubt
i
would
have
ever
tried
it
had
my
friend
not
bought
it
and
shared
a
few
this
brew
has
a
good
flavor
its
easy
to
drink
and
keeps
me
interested
another
winner
from
north
coast
o
really
great
stuff
i
may
be
looking
at
new
session
beer
here
amber
light
brown
colour
it
is
pleasantly
cloudy
two
finger
head
but
dissipated
to
a
foam
still
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
smells
of
peaches
and
grapefruit
with
a
floral
smell
intermingled
tastes
of
floral
grapefruit
and
peaches
smooth
with
sour
notes
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
which
lingers
moderate
carbonation
medium
body
there
is
a
final
fragrance
in
the
nose
reminding
me
of
thai
foodits
lemongrass
and
bergemot
my
first
first
american
amber
and
first
from
north
coast
ov
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
definitely
one
of
the
best
red
ales
out
there
especially
for
the
price
8
996pack
where
i
work
overall
crisp
clean
enjoyable
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
i
would
love
to
try
on
tap
but
the
bottle
is
definitely
worth
many
more
purchases
i
think
this
is
a
great
red
ale
style
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
taste
and
a
average
head
carbonation
is
good
and
i
recommend
this
as
a
great
session
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
north
coast
brewing
co
and
see
myself
picking
this
beer
up
many
more
times
in
the
future
pretty
tasty
red
ale
this
maybe
not
on
the
same
level
as
other
north
coast
offerings
such
as
old
rasputin
and
old
stock
ale
but
you
wont
be
disappointed

sharp

not

well
balanced
mouthfeel
is

medium

overall
ive
always
said
this
is
a
great
introductorygateway
craft
beer
you
get
a
taste
of
the
hops
but
they
wont
blow
away
the
palate
of
someone
new
to
craft
beer
always
a
good
west

amber
to
come
back
to
now
and
again
pours
out
a

color
with
a
decent
fluffy
offwhite
head
two
fingers
that
sticks
around
for
about
a
minute
and
a
half
but
leaves
behind
some
really
nice
lace
curtains
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
some
zesty
citrus
peel
tastes
of
the
same
as
the
nose
but
also
includes
a
fair
helping
of
yeasty
spice
as
well
body
and
carbonation
are
medium
strength
texture
is
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
overall
a
really
nice
amber
ale
with
a
somewhat
west
coast
hopping
bill
it
has
a
beautiful
looking
red
color
although
color
doesnt
mean
much
to
me
it
has
a
nice
sized
head
about
a
fingers
length
as
others
have
stated
that
dissipates
quite
quickly
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
it
is
a
little
bit
bitter
but
it
is
still
pleasant
to
drink
o
this
beer
has
an
excellent
balance
between
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
because
it
goes
down
easily
and
the
taste
has
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
it
would
probably
make
for
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
food
because
none
of
the
flavors
are

sweet
caramel
malt
some
yeast
and
fruity
notes
followed
by
some
earthy

bitterness
for
balance
and

nutty

nicely
balanced
brew

nice

aroma
is
mostly
malt

breads
flavor
is
very
interesting
and
unique
with
an
initially
malty
and
bitter
taste
which
transitions
to
a
floral
and
herbal
finish
medium
in
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
very
good
and
complex
brew
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
definitely
quite
drinkable

at
the
most

sitting

a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
foamy

some
slight
lacing
with
pockets
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
some
slight
scent
of
dry

and
hops
crisp
and
clean
taste
of
malts
and
slightly
bitter
hops
dry
and
mildly
bitter
finish
full
of
flavor
in
this
well
made
sipping
beer
overall
a
swell
go
to
in
the
american
red
category
although
this
isnt
a
style
i
try
often
i
have
to
say
this
beer
really
didnt
seem
like
a
finished
product
to
me
the
hop
character
is
confusing
in
this
brew
and
seems
forced
upon
the
palate
although
im
a
big
fan
of
north
coast
i
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
makes
me
sad
that
i
cannot
regularly
get
this
beer
utah
brings
in
most
everything
from
ncb
why
not
olde
stock
ale
or
this
one
this
one
is
good
enough
to
be
a
special
release
fortunately
the
brewers
make
this
one
all
the
time
and
it
is
widely
outside
of
utah
available
enjoy
this
one
if
you
have
not
tried
it
before
ive
been
trying
all
kinds
of
beers
at
krogers
where
you
can
build
your
own
sixpack
and
discovered
i
seem
to
enjoy
the
red
beers
the
best
ive
seen
red
seal
ale
many
times
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
wow
what
a
pleasant
surprise
most
beers
are
too
much
this
or
too
much
that
but
red
seal
ale
for
me
has
the
perfect
balance
of
tartness
sweetness
and
hopiness
just
right
i
will
be
reaching
for
this
one
many
more
times
in
the
future
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
if
i
could
find
it
too
a
nice
orangeredish
beer
with
about
an
inch
head
lots
of
spicy
hops
in
they
nose
tastes
of
spicy
pine
with
a
fruity
background
some
lemon
and
biscuity
notes
are
present
followed
by
a
nutty
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
a
mettalic
bite
present
which
isnt
great
but
it
isnt
ovewhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
but
slightly
oily
from
the
hops
a
very
good
amber
ale
o
short
notes
in
part
because
i
was
distracted
in
part
because
it
just
wasnt
anything
special
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
memorable
it
christmas
eve
eve
and
i
am
trying
the
red
seal
from
north
coast
i
had
had
this
beer
many
years
ago
and
it
is
nice
to
try
it
again
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
amber
clear
color
with
12
finger
thick
slightly
off
white
head
that
is
lacing
on
my
pint
glass
the
smell
is
not
powerful
subtle
nots
of
malt
and
hop
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
has
a
very
crisp
finish
malt
is
present
throughout
and
a
hint
of
roast
at
the
beginning
the
mouthfeel
is
a
niceemedium
body
amber
with
above
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
after
all
the
hype
i
really
wasnt
that
impressed
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
thats
smooth
and
drinkable
just
nothing
to
get
excited
about
spent
a
few
minutes
at
the
cold
beer
store
looking
to
try
something
new
and
i
found
this
beer
there
is
little
to
no
head
and
a
slight
fog
when
in
a
glass
when
tasting
it
starts
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
bitter
a
hoppy
aftertaste
this
brew
was
a
nice
surprise
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
offering
from
north
coast
if
i
could
i
would
keep
a
sixer
of
this
around
at
all
times
overall
to
me
its
a
pretty
drinkable
amber
ale
but
nothing
really
to
reach
for
again
and
again
ok
beer
overall
o
not
impressed
overall
one
of
my
top
beers
primarily
because
of
consistent
quality
over
the
years
first
had
it
in
the
early
90s
while
stationed
in
maryland
pennsylvania
dc
area
finely
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
all
ingredients
complementing
each
other
its
all
about
the
flavor
up
front
and
the
alcohol
hiding
in
the
background
a
great
ale
all
around
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
red
orange
color
with
a
nice
1
of
white
head
it
smells
of
citrus
hops
and
mildbread
like
malt
the
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
this
was
one
of
my
regulars
in
college
i
credit
this
as
one
of
the
beers
that
really
got
me
interested
in
beer
good
stuff
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
creamy
smooth
feel
and
light
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
there
would
be
no
issue
throwing
a
couple
of
these
back
smells
like
a
sea
fog
and
not
too
high
of
abv
it
might
just
be
able
to
save
me
from
my
double
i
p
a
addiction
which
will
probably
lead
to
my
demise
overall
i
admit
to
overlooking
this
beer
as
i
forgot
that
it
was
so
hoppy
and
well
constructed
a
classic
american
craft
beer
recommended
a
nice
beer
but
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
i
am
gushing
a
little
bit
so
let
me
say
that
the
generous
hopping
does
add
some
flair
but
is
a
detractor
from
the
mouth
feel
i
have
also
had
highly
hopped
ales
that
have
had
more
personality
on
the
palate
but
if
balance
is
what
they
were
going
for
then
they
got
it
massive
bittering
hops
without
any
malt
to
reign
them
in
results
in
a
beer
which
is
a
bit
much
on
the
palate
and
one
im
not
in
a
hurry
to
return
to
nevertheless
a
good
rendition
of
the
style
a
nice
fruity
easygoing
session
beer
overall
drinkability
might
make
a
decent
session
for
newbs
just
getting
into
hops
but
i
find
it
a
little
to
boring
and
unbalanced
not
a
bad
beer
just
thoroughly
forgettable
a
small
taster
convinced
me
to
venture
for
a
full
serving
pumped
into
a
pint
glass
a
slightly
murky
ruddy
copper
color
with
a
huge
puff
of
active
white
head
that
displayed
excellent
retention
and
left
some
crusty
lacing
on
the
glass
fresh
zesty
citrus
on
the
nose
with
a
good
balance
of
malty
sweetness
caramel
sweetness
on
the
tongue
with
a
good
mixture
of
fresh
citrus
and
piney
hops
with
a
pleasant
fruitiness
throughout
and
a
simple
mellow
bitterness
medium
body
crisp
dry
and
very
drinkable
very
good
caskconditioned
o
a
solid
beer
but
is
on
the
verge
of
being
too
bitter
for
my
personal
taste
if
you
like
a
very
hoppymalty
beer
this
would
be
one
to
try
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
it
doesnt
do
too
much
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
again
but
i
wont
give
it
another
chance
there
are
better
beers
out
there
pours
a
lighter
goldenamber
just
slightly
cloudy
offwhite
ring
stays
around
only
category
im
rating
below
good
because
its
a
little
light
in
color
for
the
style
smell
reminds
me
of
honey
biscuits
taste
is
very
good
simply
a
wellbalanced
brew
with
generous
enough
amounts
of
toasted
malt
and
floral
hops
to
satisfy
reminiscent
of
a
pale
ale
in
its
hopitude
mouthfeel
is
just
right
its
sweet
and
bitter
again
balance
excellent
brew
ogreat
example
of
the
style
and
very
drinkable
this
has
got
to
be
hands
down
the
best
amber
ive
ever
had
to
date
when
it
comes
to
an
amber
ale
all
i
really
really
want
is
a
crisp
clean
beer
with
a
good
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
bite
to
it
and
this
beer
fits
the
mold
perfectly
sadly
this
beer
isnt
readily
available
in
vancouver
from
what
i
know
if
i
had
my
way
it
would
definitely
be
my
goto
amber
ale
absolutely
mouthfeel
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
the
s
lighter
side
of
medium
carbonation
level
is
good
with
a
clean
strong
and
bitter
finish
the
whole
beer
itself
has
a
clean
fresh
and
pure
feel
to
it
overall
a
great
beer
ive
had
it
dozens
and
dozens
of
times
and
its
a
great
representation
of
the
style
o
this
beer
really
impressed
me
instantly
i
fell
in
love
with
it
and
grabbed
a
second
i
thought
it
had
the
perfect
balance
between
the
big
maltiness
with
the
hop
finish
a
definite
go
to
beer
for
me
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
not
really
my
thing
i
got
a
massive
three
fingers
of
thick
tawny
head
with
great
retention
from
my
pour
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
had
a
citrusy
scent
up
front
underlain
by
a
mild
biscuit
maltiness
i
was
beginning
to
slaver
from
the
smell
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
the
hops
were
right
there
on
the
tongue
i
began
to
feel
better
right
away
i
should
mention
that
the
hops
worked
well
with
the
malt
to
create
a
slightly
bitter
honeylike
sweetness
in
the
mouth
finish
was
semidry
and
very
tasty
the
sticky
lacing
that
began
to
appear
was
going
to
require
a
jackhammer
to
remove
bottom
line
i
like
it
better
than
i
thought
i
would
and
i
would
drink
it
again
a
great
amber
ale
that
i
will
continue
to
patronize
a
well
done
craft
ale
highly
recommended
o
pretty
well
crafted
brew
for
some
reason
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
the
taste
has
a
nice
fruity
yeast
tang
in
the
initial
entry
with
slightly
piney
flavor
from
the
hops
with
mild
floral
accents
that
is
indicative
of
noble
hops
the
taste
has
a
spicy
finish
after
mild
malt
which
helps
to
augment
the
yeast
flavor
with
gentle
sweet
flavors
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
smooth
which
adds
to
the
overall
refreshing
quality
of
the
amber
i
liked
this
and
the
finish
is
nice
and
crisp
with
lager
like
finish
this
comes
off
like
an
amped
up
anchor
steam
to
me
with
some
lager
qualities
but
nice
spice
and
yeast
flavorit
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
are
of
floral
hops
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
of
floral
hops
with
a
nice
malty
after
flavor
not
too
hoppy
but
still
pretty
good
overall
a
real
quality
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
but
also
very
drinkable
highly
recommend
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
deep
haze
poured
with
a
stiff
frosty
white
head
that
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
random
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
aromas
with
lightly
pungent
herbal
and
citrus
hops
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
creamy
smooth
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
combined
with
floral
hops
from
beginning
to
end
the
pungent
aroma
translates
into
a
similarly
pungent
taste
up
front
but
fades
as
the
assertive
carbonation
rolls
through
finishes
with
a
light
bitter
pine
hop
aftertaste
a
very
smooth
pleasantly
drinkable
red
ale
the
froth
didnt
last
very
long
overall
it
is
a
refreshing
social
beer
doesnt
require
much
thought
o
enjoyable
red
ale
its
dryness
drinks
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
the
wetter
red
ales
ive
had
not
at
the
same
level
as
bear
republics
red
rocket
or
ithacas
cascade
but
tasty
and
interesting
nonetheless
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
notes
definately
a
straight
forward
beer
very
tasty
and
drinkable
as
well
cheers
d
well
crafted
and
reallly
good
when
its
fresh
on
cask
taste
is
also
biscuity
with
a
sort
of
weird
metallic
undertone
feel
is
pretty
sharp
with
high
carbonation
i
wanted
to
keep
drinking
if
only
to
figure
out
what
i
was
tasting
after
a
few
sips
i
got
into
it
a
bit
more
its
fairly
unique
and
every
now
and
then
i
like
this
kind
of
taste
and
feel
north
coast
has
a
good
thing
going
on
this
is
how
beer
should
be
as
a
standard
easy
drinking
flavoursome
dare
i
say
yummy
o
great
to
look
at
smells
wonderful
and
the
flavor
has
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
one
of
my
favorites
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
very
drinkable
would
gladly
have
this
again
overall
this
is
a
big
disappointment
it
really
felt
like
a
good
beer
was
coming
but
this
did
not
deliver
d
simple
but
drinkable
red
ale
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
i
had
anticipated
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
hoppy
beers
and
there
isnt
a
lot
going
on
outside
of
the
hops
here
but
this
ale
went
down
pretty
easy
thanks
to
dw
for
the
trade
looking
forward
to
trying
something
from
north
coast
poured
from
the
stubby
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
appetizing
red
ale
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
fruity
slightly
hoppy
aroma
hop
forward
flavors
with
that
red
factor
balanced
by
sweet
malts
just
basic
for
me
but
certainly
would
try
again
a
solid
amber
ale
with
a
complex
flavor
profilequite
tasty
the
aroma
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
character
but
on
the
whole
its
a
good
beverage
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
12
oz
into
a
bottle
let
me
say
that
im
usually
pretty
hard
on
red
ales
it
not
being
one
of
my
favorite
styles
however
i
do
like
this
beer
plenty
of
head
on
top
of
a
bright
burgundy
body
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
and
following
up
more
of
the
same
on
the
tongue
with
a
great
malt
backbone
that
forms
the
dominating
tone
of
this
brews
flavor
great
mouthfeel
would
expect
no
less
from
northcoast
cheers
recommended
overallreally
liked
this
beer
bought
it
as
a
single
but
will
definitely
buy
this
in
6
packs
as
well
good
year
round
beer
ive
had
this
beer
elsewhere
and
ive
tasted
the
same
soap
taste
i
was
hoping
it
was
different
this
time
since
everyone
else
seems
to
enjoy
this
beer
so
much
in
the
end
i
think
i
have
to
disagree
this
beer
is
simply
alright
in
my
book
in
a
market
with
so
many
delicious
ambers
this
one
fails
in
comparison
drinkable
little
beer
and
probably
more
so
for
the
clear
and
thin
palate
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
really
wellrounded
brew
but
it
certainly
has
enough
character
to
make
it
worthwhile
drinking
a
few
i
have
to
write
this
sentence
to
meet
the
250character
limit
o
super
tasty
big
flavour
but
a
delicate
hop
malt
balance
all
of
the
parts
add
up
to
a
beer
i
need
more
of
overall
this
is
a
complex
ale
that
should
not
be
underestimated
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
any
meal
that
comes
to
my
mind
right
here
north
coast
brewing
demonstrates
the
uniqueness
of
their
grains
and
hops
which
do
not
really
taste
like
any
other
west
coast
beer
hmm
unsure
about
this
one
tastes
almost
like
a
pastit
ipa
this
beer
is
not
the
reason
nc
are
imported
to
aus
would
love
to
have
fresh
but
that
really
aint
gonna
happen

bland
with
a
bit
more
emphasis
on
the
malt
than
in
the
nose
the
same
bit
of
hop
character
and
that
subtle
off
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
and
under
carbonated
overall
not
a
beer
ill
pick
up
again
as
there
are
some
other
options
that
just
sit
better
with
me
im
not
disappointed
i
tried
it
though
i
tried
this
for
the
first
time
a
few
weeks
ago
and
it
was
responsible
for
giving
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
dryhopped
reds
theyre
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
while
the
hops
and
malts
are
at
center
stage
in
this
one
they
dont
obscure
the
fact
that
a
complex
set
of
flavors
is
at
work
here
i
noted
a
mildly
spicy
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
great
brew
and
a
good
value
o
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
quite
enjoyable
the
cpj
overall
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
could
have
just
been
a
bad
bottle
i
suppose
but
nothing
about
it
really
called
for
a
revisit
except
to
see
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
very
light
see
through
amber
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
two
finger
frothy
head
and
sporadic
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
pineapplepiney
hopslychee
and
boiled
candyit
has
a
light
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
citruspassionfruitlycheegoosberriesboiled
candy
and
finishes
with
a
hit
of
piney
hop
bitterness
and
overall
i
was
definately
hoping
for
way
more
abit
of
a
let
down
and
couldnt
recommend
citrus
and
piney
hops
are
most
present
in
the
taste
both
combine
into
a
very
strong
hop
character
for
this
beer
with
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
that
would
satisfy
any
hop
head
lemon
and
orange
rind
come
to
mind
as
well
especially
in
the
dry
mouthfeel
its
creamy
and
dry
at
the
same
time
making
for
an
interesting
feel
all
around
its
not
necessarily
balanced
due
to
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
but
it
is
very
delicious
the
hops
are
definitely
potent
all
the
way
through
and
really
combine
nicely
to
form
a
very
solid
pale
ale
a
decent
amber
ale
but
nothing
special
easy
drinking
and
a
good
autumn
beer
carbonation
is
too
high
in
my
opinion
on
tap
pours
a
semi
translucent
dirty
copper
color
with
an
inch
of
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
malty
and
floral
grape
aromas
as
well
as
maybe
some
apple
taste
is
almost
like
a
light
apple
cider
very
malty
more
apple
flavor
at
the
end
somewhat
floral
but
not
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
crisp
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
slight
bitterness
to
this
one
overall
its
a
solid
red
ale
thats
perfect
for
the
summer
worth
getting
again
caramel
everywhere
in
this
beer
caramel
color
with
small
head
nice
lacing
smells
of
carmel
and
malt
tastes
of
caramel
and
apple
quite
nice
nice
carbonation
on
the
tongue
very
nicely
balanced
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
could
live
without
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
o
quite
tasty
and
flavourful
a
solid
amber
with
a
nice
dose
of
hops
to
keep
you
entertained
easily
sessionable
and
definitely
a
pleasurable
experience
i
would
certainly
take
down
a
6er
of
this
any
day
this
beer
enjoyed
at
the
abner
pub
in
norman
ok
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
amber
color
with
a
trace
of
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
has
malty
caramel
notes
but
is
quite
light
the
taste
starts
very
caramel
sweet
and
then
finishes
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
citrusy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
overall
worth
a
try
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
red
color
the
head
was
a
light
orange
and
was
pretty
large
at
first
the
lacing
was
good
too
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
mix
of
malts
and
hops
from
what
i
could
tell
the
taste
of
te
beer
followed
the
same
basic
structure
as
the
aroma
did
malts
and
some
piney
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
too
just
a
bit
heavier
might
have
been
good
here
overall
a
decent
brew
worth
trying
again
overallbalance
balance
balance
its
something
more
and
more
ignored
in
the
craft
movement
which
is
shameful
since
its
so
important
this
is
a
very
good
amber
worth
your
time
this
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
a
good
mix
between
red
ale
and
ipa
wich
is
two
of
my
favourite
styles
of
beer
overall
a
delightfully
hoppier
amber
with
great
west
coast
character
great
for
meals
and
equally
sessionable
thumbs
up
finally
taking
the
plunge
after
passing
on
this
so
many
times
at
the
store
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
grapefruit
flowers
and
pine
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grapefruit
orange
peel
pine
light
caramel
and
grass
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
red
but
nothing
that
makes
me
wanna
come
back
and
grab
another
one
not
bad
though
o
very
nice
brew
a
real
good
amber
at
a
decent
price
ill
have
this
again
the
taste
is
really
like
it
smells
with
the
earthy
hops
showing
a
bit
more
than
can
be
detected
in
the
nose
grassy
pith
finish
that
lingers
a
candy
taste
like
old
school
hard
ribbon
candy
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
solid
malt
chewiness
food
pairing
pork
bbq
sandwiches
this
would
be
a
nice
bread
meat
cheese
beer
roasted
chicken
mild
cheese
ham
earthy
greens
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
really
enjoy
the
malt
and
hop
notes
that
this
beers
brings
nice
head
with
a
equally
good
bitterness
to
it
very
balanced
i
really
like
how
hopped
malted
and
creamyfrothy
this
beer
is
one
of
my
top
3
if
stranded
on
an
island
wonderful
beer
picked
up
a
single
at
costplus
shoutout
to
costplus
worldmarket
where
my
dogs
at
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
six
pack
as
i
said
its
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
not
too
empowering
but
makes
itself
known
which
like
it
really
reeks
of
hops
but
doesnt
taste
like
a
hoppy
beer
i
really
liked
this
one
go
pick
it
up
at
your
local
worldmarket
stay
thirsty
my
friends
overall
flavor
really
lasts
with
this
one
overall
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
o
i
read
a
lot
of
hype
over
this
beer
so
i
am
a
little
let
down
i
am
particularly
fond
of
good
hoppy
redamber
ales
i
think
this
could
be
a
little
better
balanced
however
it
is
a
very
crisp
hoppy
and
refreshing
beer
and
these
are
my
biggest
criteria
for
a
go
to
beer
well
done
north
coast
finish
earthiness
with
fresh
grass
and
a
hardy
citric
that
lingers
for
some
time
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
to
me
this
beer
screams
that
it
needs
a
pairing
with
a
cheese
or
meat
i
definitely
think
that
would
make
this
beer
a
better
experience
drinkability
definitely
drinkable
and
possible
sessionable
as
well
given
the
abv
content
the
unique
flavor
allows
red
seal
to
stand
out
among
the
other
amber
ales
furthermore
i
think
that
the
red
coast
red
seal
is
certainly
worth
a
look
because
it
is
a
good
cheap
alternative
to
oskar
blues
gordon
because
of
its
price
d
again
this
brew
is
refreshing
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
make
you
want
another
sip
though
the
watery
taste
i
get
towards
the
end
makes
me
feel
a
bit
more
quenched
it
is
a
bit
of
a
tug
of
war
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
though
there
are
things
i
prefer
over
it
overall
a
fun
one
to
try
and
id
revisit
at
some
point
down
the
road
slainte
d
i
love
good
amber
ales
but
this
stands
out
i
love
everything
about
this
beer
i
would
drink
a
6
pack
any
day
because
of
how
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
this
perfect
ale
tastes
d
leaves
me
a
bit
underwhelmed
id
rather
have
a
dipa
anyday
d
i
could
sit
with
a
six
of
this
and
enjoy
myself
easy
to
drink
with
quality
characteristics
solid
brew
picked
this
one
up
at
trader
joes
over
the
weekend
poured
a
very
solid
amber
color
not
a
lot
of
head
very
nice
hoppy
aroma
great
taste
good
amber
flavor
with
a
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
went
down
smooth
good
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
ill
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
in
the
near
future
d
definitely
drinkable
and
worth
sitting
down
to
have
more
than
1
in
a
row
nice
medium
bodied
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
all
and
all
a
very
nice
american
amber
im
glad
ive
ventured
outside
of
ol
raspy
north
coast
is
def
no
one
trick
pony
drinkability
is
probably
good
for
many
people
however
i
found
the
taste
uninviting
and
even
a
little
offputting
so
it
took
me
a
while
to
finish
it
i
had
to
have
some
nuts
with
this
to
make
it
passable
drinkability
this
is
an
ok
brew
solid
all
around
and
pretty
straight
forward
not
the
best
but
far
from
the
worst
worth
a
try
if
its
available
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
fan
fair
no
problem
d
i
prefer
a
darker
beer
but
this
definitely
has
the
ability
to
be
an
every
day
beer
drinkability
now
this
is
one
that
i
can
drink
because
i
want
more
of
all
those
hops
the
bitterness
is
not
enough
to
cut
into
the
drinkability
its
the
flavor
and
aroma
hops
that
gets
you
hooked
12
ounce
bottle
pours
clear
red
orange
color
with
a
2
finger
off
white
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
of
citrus
floral
pine
caramel
and
some
spices
taste
matches
the
nose
very
well
with
a
nice
crisp
clean
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
bit
on
the
finish
this
goes
down
very
well
and
is
very
drinkable
very
nicely
balanced
flavors
medium
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
highly
enjoyable
and
full
of
flavor
before
i
knew
it
my
glass
was
empty
excellent
stuff
beer
is
lead
off
sweet
with
an
immediate
hop
character
opening
up
on
the
midpalate
of
the
beer
the
finish
is
moderately
to
lightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
bodied
minimal
carbonation
nice
connectivity
i
used
to
have
this
beer
on
draft
all
the
time
in
fl
one
of
the
few
craft
beers
available
and
the
time
and
i
loved
it
im
glad
to
return
to
it
now
getting
the
same
enjoyment
from
the
bottle
id
have
this
again
another
solid
beer
from
these
guys
not
my
favorite
brew
from
them
but
well
worth
drinking
notes
a
brew
that
id
gladly
pick
up
out
there
but
that
i
doubt
ill
ever
bring
home
again
fourthbeer
potential
above
average
not
very
heavy
and
the
hoppy
character
is
a
good
complement
to
the
maltiness
expected
with
the
style
drinkability
very
smooth
it
was
lighter
than
expected
and
very
drinkable
d
good
but
doesnt
draw
me
back
but
i
would
recommend
it
overall
red
seal
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
amber
ale
its
not
a
potent
super
flavorful
brew
but
it
is
a
nicedrinking
easygoing
amber
ale
that
was
well
enjoyed
by
me
highly
recommended
d
it
drank
good
and
was
tasty
and
crisp
i
recommend
it
paired
alongside
bbq
chicken
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
sporting
a
nice
hoppy
edge
but
nothing
over
the
top
it
would
make
for
a
good
repeat
offender
at
the
pub
i
imagine
should
this
ever
arrive
in
alberta
as
such
i
only
suggest
this
particular
conceit
as
a
concerned
beerappreciating
citizen
yknow
this
is
a
classic
craft
beer
great
for
people
being
introduced
to
the
craft
scene
summary
good
session
beer
that
wont
bore
good
for
everyday
drinking
d
something
i
definitely
enjoyed
nothing
crazy
but
a
good
beer
drinkability
while
most
beers
i
rate
on
ba
are
not
my
first
time
tasting
this
one
was
and
am
shocked
of
how
great
it
was
not
a
beer
for
everyone
if
your
into
english
aleslagers
or
brown
ales
this
one
is
for
you
my
go
to
for
the
style
consistently
pours
with
a
white
creamy
head
which
is
thick
and
stays
around
nicely
drinkability
is
outstanding
even
for
the
style
a
great
summer
beer
with
plenty
of
balance
and
enough
going
on
in
mouthfeel
to
not
disappoint
or
bore
you
notes
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
with
very
good
balance
and
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazzy
copper
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malt
the
taste
at
first
is
bitter
and
then
switches
to
a
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
light
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
the
way
it
finishes
sweet
d
this
went
well
with
my
meal
and
was
very
refreshing
ive
only
ever
had
a
few
beers
on
cask
so
its
hard
to
say
exactly
how
this
matches
up
but
i
was
impressed
with
it
at
the
time
so
there
you
go
i
would
order
it
again
overall
what
was
most
striking
about
this
beer
was
the
wonderful
symmetry
of
the
hops
and
the
malts
as
suggested
by
the
label
the
brew
is
created
with
only
the
most
basic
ingredients
and
that
idea
certainly
comes
through
to
the
finish
its
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
especially
in
light
of
its
sessionable
5
5
abv
it
has
substance
and
a
distinctive
flavor
but
is
never
aggressive
this
would
be
a
great
session
ale
it
is
flavorful
without
being
filling
it
is
more
on
the
average
side
of
beer
because
of
the
lighter
body
very
smooth
drinker
citrus
flavor
might
wear
after
a
while
but
still
very
enjoyable
easily
drinkable
d
ive
heard
rumors
that
this
beer
is
now
about
half
the
beer
it
once
was
after
some
drastic
recipe
changes
i
wasnt
into
craft
beer
back
in
those
days
so
i
cant
judge
however
i
do
know
that
the
version
i
drank
was
substandard
d
this
beer
would
have
been
more
drinkable
if
it
werent
for
the
bitterness
at
the
end
it
was
also
a
bit
watery
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
after
having
other
beers
by
north
coast
and
i
was
sadly
disappointed
this
beer
was
alright
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
picking
up
any
more
final
notes
my
first
sort
of
disappointment
from
north
coast
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
this
price
you
could
probably
find
a
better
amber
ale
its
ok
but
im
not
likely
to
buy
it
again
d
reasonable
probably
a
lot
better
fresher
a
lovely
orange
beer
smelling
of
grassy
hops
and
caramel
malt
the
taste
itself
is
very
sweet
with
some
fruity
esters
and
spicy
hop
sneaking
in
over
the
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
a
mess
as
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
clean
finishit
gets
bitter
and
sort
of
unbalanced
towards
the
endbut
overall
its
a
nice
solid
red
ale
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
brown
with
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
that
fades
into
a
thin
layer
upon
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
nice
fruit
esters
particularly
of
red
apple
and
orange
zest
in
addition
there
is
a
nice
aroma
of
caramel
that
when
paired
with
the
apple
smells
wonderful
the
first
taste
hits
with
a
strong
bitter
flavor
that
does
slowly
fade
away
but
yet
still
leaves
you
with
the
fact
that
it
is
a
bitter
beer
though
the
beer
is
nice
and
crisp
there
are
notes
of
both
cloves
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
while
well
carbonated
is
in
my
opinion
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
not
too
much
that
the
beer
is
unpleasant
despite
all
of
the
set
backs
its
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
telling
people
to
get
the
only
concern
i
have
is
that
its
not
really
a
red
ale
its
more
of
an
epa
or
apa
but
as
a
beer
its
not
bad
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
real
unique
flavour
that
i
can
never
quite
put
my
tongue
on
a
very
dynamic
beer
it
has
a
polished
feel
that
seems
to
be
missing
in
many
macro
brews
d
this
is
a
drinkable
red
ale
with
a
thick
malt
character
the
hops
fall
a
but
too
far
on
the
musty
side
if
the
spectrum
for
my
taste
but
they
serve
their
purpose
by
balancing
the
malt
a
reasonably
nice
amber
ale
but
not
nearly
as
exciting
as
the
some
other
north
coast
beers
d
again
the
carbonation
makes
this
less
than
a
superstar
beer
it
is
highly
sessionable
unless
you
find
burping
to
be
a
big
problem
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
and
another
great
beer
by
north
coast
keep
em
coming
a
hopforward
amber
that
isnt
too
big
to
be
enjoyed
in
quantity
now
only
if
north
coast
would
date
their
products
so
that
i
could
confidently
enjoy
this
at
home
overall
a
goodtasting
and
wellbalanced
beer
that
is
rather
subtle
in
all
its
traits
making
it
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
at
once
if
you
wanted
to
sessionable
moreys
bottom
line
ive
heard
that
this
brewery
makes
quality
beer
and
as
far
as
this
ones
concerned
it
appears
to
be
true
one
of
the
better
red
ales
that
i
have
had
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
not
sure
about
freshness
but
if
it
is
a
julian
code
on
the
bottom
then
this
bottle
is
four
and
a
half
months
old
oops
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
moderate
carbonation
is
visible
as
well
as
bits
and
clouds
of
yeast
34
inch
of
head
forms
and
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
nicely
balanced
with
fresh
and
spicy
hops
up
front
and
a
more
subtle
malt
medium
body
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
a
good
dose
of
hops
greets
the
palate
not
too
much
just
enough
for
you
to
appreciate
the
flavor
and
then
it
gets
balanced
out
by
a
fairly
clean
malt
definitely
session
material
despite
being
well
past
its
prime
the
hops
are
still
relatively
lively
with
a
mild
resiny
texture
i
had
this
on
tap
a
few
months
back
and
that
was
definitely
a
better
experience
i
wont
be
too
harsh
since
i
can
imagine
what
this
is
like
when
it
is
fresher
o
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
remember
it
as
better
maybe
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
as
it
feels
this
doesnt
get
better
with
time
on
hand
pump
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
beautifully
bright
with
a
nice
amber
color
and
a
creamy
head
and
excellent
lacing
the
smell
exhibits
alight
slightly
sour
graininess
some
gentle
sweetness
and
some
earthy
hops
quite
a
nice
taste
on
cask
slightly
sweet
and
earthy
with
nice
earthy
hops
and
a
firm
but
mild
bitterness
which
lingers
nicely
firm
but
with
a
soft
finish
in
the
mouth
quite
pleasant
id
never
refuse
one
but
i
wouldnt
have
dreams
about
it
this
was
a
solidly
lessthanaverage
beer
with
a
pretty
label
and
too
much
hype
it
had
an
attractive
copper
color
and
a
puffy
head
that
looked
comfy
enough
to
float
a
beach
raft
but
it
had
an
odd
lack
of
aroma
i
detected
some
soap
and
some
yeast
and
a
little
something
that
could
be
construed
as
malt
but
the
taste
what
taste
aside
from
a
flabby
soapy
bitter
flavor
this
was
nearly
tastefree
it
had
the
nippy
fizz
of
an
amber
but
thats
where
the
fun
ended
phooey
rjt
md
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
all
the
way
from
the
tongue
down
the
palate
all
the
way
to
the
stomach
i
can
definitely
easily
drink
this
beer
this
beer
would
definitely
be
part
of
another
session
another
day
i
had
thought
this
was
an
apa
before
but
saw
it
is
an
amberred
ale
now
when
i
taste
it
i
can
see
why
its
a
red
ale
even
if
it
has
the
hoppiness
of
a
typical
apa
a
decent
balance
of
mild
hops
and
malt
flavor
make
this
beer
a
pleasant
socal
beer
not
much
complexity
but
the
simplicity
definitely
works
for
the
beer
a
smooth
carbonation
with
a
mild
bitterness
definitely
a
solid
brew
d
a
decent
red
ale
a
nice
combo
of
hops
and
malts
would
try
again
tastespicy
toasted
malt
rye
notes
and
a
nice
hoppy
bite
that
complements
rather
than
overpowers
nicely
balanced
and
sessionable
a
good
match
for
a
cheeseburger
or
a
pizza
all
in
all
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
very
easy
drinking
as
well
feel
wise
this
is
crisp
but
a
little
powder
however
this
is
still
a
refreshing
brew
ive
enjoyed
this
on
tap
before
but
usually
avoided
seconds
in
my
quest
to
try
everything
else
available
probably
a
mistake
since
this
is
a
good
good
beer
perhaps
next
time
ill
eschew
the
variety
and
go
with
something
thats
just
good
like
this
this
has
become
my
favorite
go
to
beer
it
has
beautiful
reddish
color
with
a
perfect
amount
of
head
a
good
hoppy
upfront
taste
with
a
soothing
after
taste
very
well
balanced
not
complex
just
a
straightforward
enjoyable
beer
i
continue
to
search
but
have
yet
to
find
a
better
everyday
beer
this
is
pretty
true
to
the
style
with
a
nice
color
and
decent
flavors
definitely
not
my
favorite
amber
ale
but
a
solid
brew
to
keep
in
the
fridge
especially
if
youre
planning
on
having
burgers
or
other
bbqd
food
more
good
stuff
from
north
coast
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
session
beer
nice
flavor
profile
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
a
couple
just
for
the
sake
that
i
thought
this
could
have
been
a
little
more
flavorful
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
north
coast
i
appreciate
its
understated
qualities
by
north
coast
standards
and
that
it
is
so
wellbalanced
overall
not
the
tastiest
beers
around
but
definitely
a
beer
you
could
drink
exclusively
for
the
entire
night
and
not
be
disappointed
d
extremely
drinkable
it
is
extremely
hoppy
but
it
doesnt
leave
the
tongue
numb
its
medium
bodied
and
very
dry
and
crisp
and
i
imagine
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
you
wanted
to
a
very
very
very
good
brew
and
the
best
ive
tried
from
north
coast
the
others
ive
tried
include
rasputin
pranqster
and
old
stock
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
i
think
this
might
be
my
very
favorite
beer
tastes
a
little
washed
out
i
honestly
thought
id
never
say
this
but
its
short
on
malt
and
im
almost
never
feeling
that
way
with
these
types
of
beers
i
recall
liking
this
beer
much
more
in
the
past
maybe
it
just
suffered
from
being
poured
after
the
acme
ipa
which
i
thought
was
a
bit
more
flamboyant
but
hardly
a
monster
i
dont
know
d
feels
likes
its
a
malty
adjunct
wasnt
great
big
let
down
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
gladly
be
drinking
the
rest
of
the
pack
rolled
through
a
few
bottles
of
this
recently
a
nice
beer
but
unfortunately
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
dont
hold
up
to
the
malty
goodness
of
the
smell
the
smell
is
wonderful
very
concentrated
malts
along
with
nice
balancing
hops
i
expect
the
flavor
to
be
more
intense
instead
it
is
a
bit
watery
which
is
exacerbated
by
the
early
carbonation
as
the
bubbles
ease
there
is
a
bit
more
flavor
but
i
want
more
a
beer
that
has
a
smell
for
deep
thoughts
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
simple
at
the
right
price
i
still
would
enjoy
this
beer
overall
a
simply
average
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
to
make
it
memorable
reddish
amber
white
head
smells
of
malted
barley
and
fresh
hops
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
should
piney
slightly
bitter
but
malty
and
lively
modlight
body
make
drinkabality
very
nice
this
is
a
great
session
beer
a
true
goto
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
at
map
room
pours
a
light
amber
mostly
gold
light
white
head
nothing
special
aroma
is
light
rye
with
hops
taste
is
mostly
hops
but
not
tasty
the
feel
is
ok
not
very
drinkable
pretty
boring
in
geneal
not
a
good
effort
dreally
let
down
by
this
one
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
it
north
coast
just
a
really
bland
almost
macro
seeming
version
of
a
pale
ale
even
though
its
supposed
to
be
an
amber
really
great
pale
ale
west
coast
style
well
balanced
and
full
of
complex
flavors
served
from
tap
into
a
standard
pint
pours
copper
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
lingers
maintains
nice
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
hops
with
a
small
hint
of
malt
the
flavor
was
of
milds
hops
and
a
partial
malt
aftertaste
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
very
nice
for
a
red
ale
it
was
more
like
a
light
ipa
in
my
opinion
but
still
nice
it
is
worth
trying
for
any
ipa
or
red
ale
lover
out
there
pours
a
clear
copperyred
in
color
aroma
gives
hints
of
bready
sweetness
hoppy
snap
upon
tasting
flavor
follow
with
breadiness
in
the
aroma
coupled
with
a
nice
balancing
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
simple
yet
deceptively
tasty
ale
my
friends
and
i
have
tried
to
replicate
in
our
homebrewing
dm
very
drinkable
but
so
is
water
and
gatorade
and
they
may
have
more
palate
flavor
than
this
comments
a
beer
of
the
month
selection
this
is
a
great
allaround
beer
that
i
could
recommend
to
just
about
anyone
12oz
bottle
served
at
50
degrees
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
no
freshness
dating
on
the
label
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
a
frothy
one
inch
offwhite
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
18th
inch
skim
with
some
bands
and
spots
of
lacing
exposed
during
the
tasting
nose
suggests
carameltoffee
a
hint
of
citrus
a
faint
earthy
hops
presence
and
a
slightly
metallic
character
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
its
a
bit
muted
and
there
is
also
something
of
a
spicy
character
not
sure
if
its
the
carbonation
projecting
into
the
flavor
profile
but
thats
what
i
get
finishes
with
a
light
lingering
bitterness
however
metallic
quality
from
the
nose
seems
to
have
dissipated
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
assertive
carbonation
not
my
favorite
amber
but
solid
respectable
and
flavorful
at
5
5
d
very
well
balanced
listed
as
a
red
ale
but
taste
more
like
a
pale
ale
nice
session
type
beer
to
have
more
than
one
d
ya
its
pretty
drinkable
o
definitely
recommend
the
draft
version
has
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
than
the
bottle
version
but
both
are
good
beers
this
was
recommended
to
me
by
the
bartender
at
my
local
bar
i
think
ive
had
it
in
bottles
and
im
also
a
fan
of
some
of
the
other
north
coast
brewery
beers
but
i
was
not
that
thrilled
with
this
one
color
was
a
little
light
for
an
amberred
more
like
a
pale
good
carbonation
but
neither
the
maltiness
or
the
hoppines
jumped
out
at
me
a
good
session
beer
but
not
too
exciting
d
good
drinkability
easy
to
drink
not
too
filling
lighter
without
sacrificing
taste
the
may
bonus
selection
for
the
botm
really
good
atmosphere
appearance
in
pretty
simple
but
deep
rich
color
and
great
lacing
nose
is
also
simple
but
very
rich
and
full
it
does
what
it
does
well
flavor
has
a
certain
complexity
of
grain
components
with
some
subtle
spice
and
a
little
citrus
really
dry
feel
but
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
appearance
is
light
brown
with
a
red
hue
lots
of
carbonation
the
head
is
white
about
2
finger
high
and
laces
the
glass
smell
is
nice
with
hops
standing
out
taste
is
good
not
much
bite
from
the
hops
smooth
and
malty
taste
very
drinkable
d
low
abv
refreshing
hop
flavor
and
thin
body
combine
to
make
it
easy
to
drink
it
seems
like
this
beer
would
be
appropriate
for
most
any
occasion
i
could
probably
drink
a
sixpack
by
myself
and
still
want
more
d
one
of
the
best
examples
of
of
american
amber
ive
tried
refreshing
without
sacrificing
flavor
a
perfect
session
beer
d
a
great
example
of
what
an
american
red
ale
can
be
hoppy
malty
and
refreshing
all
at
once
definitely
a
sessionworthy
brew
d
a
good
beer
not
over
the
top
like
some
american
pale
ales
balanced
and
refreshing
good
by
itself
or
with
food
doesnt
wear
out
your
taste
buds
just
makes
them
very
happy
this
is
definitely
a
west
coast
interpretation
of
an
american
amber
ale
while
not
terribly
complex
it
was
one
of
the
more
notable
session
beers
i
have
tried
in
a
while
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
rising
withing
on
top
sits
a
modest
head
of
tan
bubbles
it
leaves
a
very
slight
coat
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
has
a
deep
floral
hop
aroma
that
is
kind
of
woodsy
behind
this
is
the
scent
of
pale
malts
not
wheat
but
other
light
colored
grains
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
the
malts
are
bready
and
slightly
sweet
the
hops
provide
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
the
finish
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
bitter
beer
the
hop
level
is
just
right
for
a
pale
ale
like
the
red
seal
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
the
style
as
well
medium
body
light
carbonation
and
a
normal
level
of
coating
its
a
bit
sticky
but
not
sweet
or
sugary
its
supremely
drinkable
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
almost
and
craft
beer
drinker
could
enjoy
multiple
rounds
of
plus
its
appropriate
year
round
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
ive
bought
it
in
the
past
and
will
certainly
continue
to
do
so
give
it
a
try
if
you
havent
yet
the
body
was
good
full
and
smooth
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
a
day
long
partner
of
a
brew
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
one
of
these
beauties
and
ill
try
not
to
let
it
be
so
long
again
d
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
i
just
cant
get
into
this
one
the
first
sip
shows
a
lot
of
promise
but
it
disintegrates
quickly
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
and
hope
for
a
different
effect
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
1finger
offwhite
soapy
head
tiny
bit
of
sediment
seen
floating
stays
in
decent
shape
the
whole
time
leaves
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
good
hops
and
caramel
pretty
spoton
for
the
style
taste
really
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
much
too
watery
and
bland
it
definitely
could
use
some
more
hops
the
slight
flavors
i
pick
up
are
a
light
fruity
malt
and
a
bit
of
bread
in
the
aftertaste
i
think
im
even
getting
a
hint
of
booze
which
to
me
is
unacceptable
for
a
5
5
the
hops
along
with
some
butterylike
sweetness
seem
to
make
themselves
more
known
about
halfway
through
which
helps
this
beer
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
definitely
thin
a
watery
malty
taste
lingers
afterwords
aftertaste
starts
to
reminds
me
of
magic
hats
9
for
some
reason
easy
to
drink
quite
inoffensive
not
terrible
somewhat
refreshing
but
overall
pretty
boring
and
watery
you
can
get
a
6pack
of
nugget
nectar
for
2
bucks
more
than
a
6pack
of
this
a
pretty
easy
decision
if
you
ask
me
d
the
drinkability
for
this
one
is
there
i
would
have
more
than
two
of
these
but
it
would
not
be
my
go
to
a
good
hoppy
amber
which
sets
itself
apart
from
others
due
to
its
spicy
and
pepper
hop
character
d
falls
between
an
amber
and
an
apa
which
works
out
nicely
for
what
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
a
clear
amber
color
body
with
a
thin
off
white
head
medium
carbonation
little
to

cheers
drinkability
is
super
high
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
made
to
drink
all
night
and
if
i
wasnt
at
baileys
i
would
certainly
be
doing
so
from
this
cask
a
nice
and
drinkable
red
ale
d
i
really
liked
this
ale
a
really
solid
amber
with
a
great
sweet
flavor
of
vanilla
caramel
notes
and
a
nice
lemony
sharp
bitterness
to
keep
everything
balanced
subtle
flavorful
and
fantastic
the
bittering
hops
on
top
of
a
watery
and
somewhat
balancing
maltiness
doesnt
do
much
for
me
its
drinkable
but
given
the
option
id
quickly
choose
to
try
something
else
when
i
appreciate
red
ales
a
lot
more
i
will
revisit
this
one
pours
a
red
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
slightlysweet
amber
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
taste
has
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
along
with
caramel
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
pretty
typical
for
the
style
drinkability
about
the
samenice
and
crispy
without
all
that
much
coming
through
d
i
could
enjoy
a
more
than
one
it
seems
like
an
early
summer
late
spring
beer
for
the
price
a
great
staple
pours
a
really
thick
head
nothing
frothy
but
thick
and
luscious
a
golden
amber
red
body
thick
with
nice
color
as
always
my
sense
of
smell
is
awful
but
mostly
just
a
malt
aroma
simple
yet
solid
id
say
or
maybe
complexly
simple
as
the
bottle
touts
the
beer
contains
only
water
malted
barley
hopes
and
yeast
so
they
take
pride
in
this
very
good
body
to
it
and
easily
drinkable
probably
anytime
of
the
year
could
have
sworn
this
was
an
ipa
with
the
hop
taste
and
smell
not
that
im
complaining
this
is
a
great
brew
that
is
a
regular
in
my
fridge
d
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
the
carbonation
really
takes
away
from
this
beers
potential
but
all
in
all
a
drinkable
beer
deep
amber
color
with
a
chunky
white
head
that
melts
into
a
fine
lace
yeasty
malt
aroma
with
some
mild
lemony
hops
malt
dominates
the
flavor
dry
slightly
nutty
with
muted
fruit
esters
reminiscent
of
apricot
and
peach
dusty
and
yeasty
hops
are
mostly
bittering
with
a
dry
lemony
quality
just
enough
to
clean
up
the
finish
and
bring
the
malt
flavors
out
a
classic
west
coast
style
quaffer
from
one
of
norcals
best
breweries
indeed
a
fine
american
red
amber
ale
overall
a
good
experience
d
over
all
a
very
nice
pale
ale
will
definitly
buy
again
would
like
to
try
on
tap
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
can
be
crossed
off
the
list
i
wasnt
very
impressed
would
i
have
another
if
someone
bought
it
for
me
absolutely
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
my
own
though
d
very
disappointing
weak
smell
mild
flavor
weird
finish
overall
excellent
beer
this
is
one
of
the
few
north
coast
beers
that
is
relatively
easy
to
find
here
in
chicago
you
would
be
surprised
at
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
scrimshaw
here
it
is
a
standard
for
me
for
good
reason
delicious
not
too
high
in
abv
fantastic
session
ipa
value
9
99
for
a
six
pack
price
should
come
down
a
buck
in
my
opinion
though
obviously
thats
not
north
coasts
fault
body
was
medium
crisp
carbonation
throughout
and
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
great
beer
measures
up
with
sierra
nevada
pale
d
good
nothing
outstanding
or
fancy
off
the
cask
pours
light
brown
with
a
lingering
white
head
the
aroma
is
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
some
malt
as
well
the
flavor
is
similar
with
strong
citrus
hops
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
very
good
beer
kind
of
a
mix
between
an
american
red
ale
and
an
american
pale
ale
great
take
on
the
style
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
lot
code
or
expiration
date
sampled
on
christmas
day
2009
the
pour
is
amberred
with
nice
clarity
and
about
a
halfinch
of
creamy
foamy
head
with
clinging
lacing
the
carbonation
remains
active
throughout
the
tasting
the
aroma
is
mostly
hopped
but
there
is
a
kind
of
cherrylike
note
in
there
the
mouthfeel
runs
about
medium
the
taste
is
full
of
bitter
hops
caramel
malts
and
a
mixture
of
toffee
and
honey
pretty
nice
drank
it
quick
bam
taste
like
a
hybrid
paleamber
ale
has
the
malt
backbone
of
an
amber
but
doesnt
come
off
heavy
earthy
or
woody
and
has
the
hop
presence
of
west
coast
pales
develops
as
you
drink
it
and
makes
you
want
another
a
good
session
amber
beer
made
from
what
used
to
be
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
those
days
are
long
gone
and
there
is
no
reason
to
visit
their
expensive
low
quality
taphouse
they
have
going
just
buy
their
beer
at
the
supermarket
better
that
way
thoughts
this
is
a
hoppy
red
ale
d
this
is
another
one
done
in
my
book
flavors
stand
out
in
this
beer
and
not
always
good
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
many
others
to
pick
from
that
are
better
in
the
style
d
very
drinkable
and
very
good
drink
would
definitely
drink
more
in
the
near
future
d
this
beer
is
interestingly
spiced
for
a
sessionable
beer
a
touch
overspiced
but
it
does
go
down
easily
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
nice
to
have
one
or
two
d
this
is
a
very
good
palered
ale
kind
of
straddling
the
borderline
of
the
two
styles
i
dont
now
why
i
havent
had
it
in
such
a
long
time
good
flavour
and
well
priced
one
of
the
best
amber
beers
that
i
have
tried
it
has
a
lot
of
citrus
that
is
reminiscent
of
earl
grey
tea
and
it
finishes
with
a
mediumlight
bitterness
then
the
flavor
lightens
and
dissipates
it
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
it
smells
malty
and
citrusy
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
for
its
style
and
would
be
a
great
refreshment
during
the
summer
it
is
also
nice
that
it
is
reasonably
priced
d
still
pretty
good
but
id
proly
order
the
regular
red
seal
9
of
10
times
something
is
lost
here
with
the
cask
shocking
as
most
beers
are
stunners
on
the
beer
engine
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
but
does
tease
at
being
a
heavier
flavor
is
to
come
have
a
bit
of
a
robust
signature
but
does
not
take
too
much
away
from
its
quiet
presence
it
is
enjoyable
and
is
not
too
overwhelming
on
the
pallet
obviously
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
what
i
would
consider
a
beer
advocates
goto
brew
along
the
lines
of
stone
levitation
a
very
solid
slightly
under
appreciated
delicious
beer
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
minimal
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
nose
is
weak
mostly
some
spicy
hops
some
grapefruit
and
malt
it
tastes
much
more
maltier
than
i
remember
the
hops
dont
really
jump
out
as
this
beer
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
given
its
average
abv
overall
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
was
nothing
like
i
remember
it
being
this
was
one
of
my
early
favorite
craft
brews
but
now
it
just
seems
bland
and
too
dominated
by
malt
to
be
considered
one
of
the
essential
american
pale
ales
maybe
my
bottle
was
a
little
old
one
day
ill
drink
another
and
update
this
post
if
needed
not
what
i
was
expecting
smooth
malty
and
creamy
with
very
little
hop
influence
pours
a
clear
dark
red
color
with
a
bit
of
head
nice
thick
chewy
malt
flavors
abound
definitely
drinkable
and
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
id
definitely
go
back
to
it
d
i
drank
this
one
as
the
beer
got
warmer
i
will
say
that
the
best
flavors
were
on
the
colder
sideright
after
opening
where
as
the
beer
towards
room
temp
began
showing
its
ugly
side
d
high
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
a
amberred
d
i
only
had
one
bottle
but
could
easily
have
thrown
back
a
few
more
of
these
while
watching
the
pats
beat
up
on
the
jets
nice
piney
hop
finish
that
kinda
lingers
on
the
palate
beer
had
good
carb
and
was
medium
bodied
very
plain
compares
with
my
first
homebrew
but
with
less
taste
dmediocre
amber
ale
at
best
but
an
exceedingly
good
apa
that
is
what
i
thought
i
was
drinking
from
the
label
it
was
not
until
i
saw
the
brewers
website
and
the
style
classification
on
this
site
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
it
is
not
a
very
good
amber
not
dark
enough
and
not
enough
malt
presence
in
the
aroma
or
the
taste
if
an
apa
i
would
rate
it
4

easily
sessionable
not
my
favorite
from
north
coast
but
very
good
and
recomended
drinkability
increases
as
does
the
creaminess
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
good
easy
to
down
a
few
of
these
its
a
good
beer
probably
a
repeat
buy
great
for
the
fall
d
really
spectacular
beer
for
a
tough
style
to
master
not
a
bad
bev
but
not
a
favorite
seems
a
little
unbalanced
drinkability
is
high
for
the
style
as
i
like
the
boldly
hopped
twist
on
the
style
5
0
in
drinkability
for
my
preference
but
its
more
like
a
3
5
according
to
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
im
not
much
on
the
style
but
i
think
there
are
better
ambers
overall
very
solid
and
a
nice
sessionable
and
malty
ale
i
was
actually
quite
happy
with
this
one
and
glad
to
have
grabbed
one
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
with
some
creaminess
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
an
amber
or
red
ale
simply
a
pale
ale
from
that
perspective
i
think
its
okay
but
if
im
looking
for
my
hop
beat
down
id
probably
look
elsewhere
d
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
ruedrichs
red
seal
ale
from
north
coast
brewing
co
is
a
very
good
beer
the
color
is
absolutely
beautiful
on
the
tongue
i
can
detect
a
malty
earthy
combination
a
few
hops
are
present
but
nothing
to
satisfy
a
hophead
the
drinkability
is
high
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
a
nice
amber
ale
poured
a
dark
orangebrownish
color
with
a
one
finger
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
left
no
lacing
behind
at
all
on
my
glass
not
the
most
appetizing
looking
of
beers
smell
and
taste
is
pretty
good
malty
sweetness
up
front
some
fruits
in
here
too
a
good
hop
balance
to
the
malts
and
a
slight
hint
of
raisin
the
mouthfeel
is
also
good
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
feel
it
is
also
pretty
highly
carbonated
which
throws
the
mouthfeel
off
a
bit
but
still
good
mouth
is
coated
with
good
bitterness
and
no
alcohol
is
picked
up
drinkability
is
decent
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
the
sweetness
started
to
overtake
the
beer
and
it
started
to
lose
a
lot
of
flavor
still
a
good
amber
not
sure
when
i
will
get
this
one
again
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
nice
big
white
head
the
head
reduced
to
almost
nothing
but
was
barely
there
left
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
was
hoppy
at
first
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
the
taste
was
hoppy
and
sweet
had
a
ibt
of
caramel
in
there
pretty
good
stuff
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
so
im
glad
i
finally
did
id
pick
it
up
again
no
problem
d
very
great
for
an
almost
hop
head
i
think
drank
it
fast
and
then
had
another
well
worth
buying
color
is
ambercopper
translucent
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aroma
was
light
with
notes
of
orange
and
pink
grapefruit
citrus
and
caramel
malt
flavor
was
mild
but
pleasant
bready
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
light
citrus
and
spice
hops
flavor
coming
through
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
bready
malt
finish
aftertaste
was
light
a
bit
grassyspicy
nice
balance
in
flavor
but
could
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
medium
body
was
noticeable
in
the
mouthfeel
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
although
a
bit
mellow
in
flavor
for
me
this
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
not
overpowering
in
flavor
or
abv
could
have
several
drinkability
while
i
call
this
far
more
drinkable
than
most
other
beers
of
the
style
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
them
all
night
id
have
no
problem
ordering
a
second
pint
however
when
presented
in
the
correct
context
i
bet
this
beer
is
great
with
a
meal
nice
drinkability
hop
bite
lasts
a
long
time
and
can
get
old
fast
would
benefit
from
a
cleaner
finish
still
a
really
solid
hoppy
beer
this
is
an
american
amber
that
is
an
interesting
example
of
the
style
the
beer
is
gold
amber
with
a
white
head
the
head
leaves
lovely
lasting
lace
down
the
sides
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
fruity
malty
nutty
the
yeast
resembles
apricots
or
maybe
peaches
this
is
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
the
yeast
profile
sets
this
beer
apart
from
many
other
reds
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
amber
at
a
relatively
low
abv
and
id
happily
follow
it
up
with
another
so
i
guess
it
fits
the
definition
of
a
session
ale
d
extremely
good
brew
to
just
relax
with
or
to
cut
through
heavier
more
favorful
foods
overall
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
due
to
the
light
mouthfeel
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
this
til
the
snowflakes
fly
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
orange
hue
beige
and
bubbly
head
that
quickly
fizzles
away
has
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
but
nothing
too
strong
where
the
beer
earns
its
points
is
in
its
taste
with
a
perfect
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
sweetness
is
a
mix
of
spice
and
citrus
while
the
hops
take
over
at
the
end
and
can
also
be
sensed
in
the
beginning
light
tingly
mouth
feel
that
has
the
right
thickness
overall
definitely
a
beer
for
any
occasion
d
other
than
nugget
nectar
this
is
my
favorite
amber
ale
in
existance
and
since
it
is
readily
available
in
la
it
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
however
this
is
one
i
enjoy
out
of
the
bottle
rather
than
tap
d
easy
to
drink
with
enough
going
on
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
d
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
buy
it
again
and
again
m
d
creamy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
selection
and
one
i
will
recommend
to
my
friends
notes
possibly
the
standard
bearer
for
the
style
d
definitely
a
session
amber
flavor
is
accessible
yet
enjoyable
and
the
body
isnt
too
heavy
easy
to
quaff
yet
substantial
enough
to
sip
a
solid
amber
had
this
one
the
other
day
after
work
poured
a
copper
color
with
pearly
head
that
left
decent
lacing
smelled
of
caramel
malts
bitter
hops
and
fruit
tasted
malty
nutty
and
slightly
hoppy
a
little
bit
dry
feel
to
it
but
otherwise
pretty
sessionable
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
nothing
overwhelming
easy
to
drink
something
to
enjoy
multiples
of
while
still
getting
good
flavor
very
drinkable
but
nothing
to
look
forward
to
a
nice
amber
color
with
two
finger
creamcolored
head
excellent
lacing
s
even
the
smell
is
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
taste
is
very
hop
forward
but
it
mellows
with
the
balance
of
the
malt
overall
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
makes
me
want
to
continue
drinking
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
besides
the
taste
is
the
price
very
affordable
for
the
quality
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
there
was
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
gave
way
to
some
decent
lacing
the
overall
aroma
was
of
citrusy
hops
with
malts
at
the
end
the
taste
was
up
front
of
hops
that
were
floral
or
citrusy
the
end
of
the
beer
went
to
a
malty
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
harsh
there
was
a
slightly
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
the
overall
drinkability
was
average
the
hop
taste
wasnt
as
clean
as
i
would
have
liked
and
was
a
little
harsher
than
i
wanted
overall
though
it
was
a
good
solid
beer
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
beer
still
pretty
good
while
the
appearance
is
not
overly
impressive
the
taste
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
makes
it
nice
especially
in
the
warmer
months
d
very
complex
little
beer
the
scent
and
taste
are
not
one
and
the
same
like
many
beers
which
can
be
a
good
thing
very
drinakable
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
amber
that
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
tried
this
in
the
bottle
before
and
wasnt
nearly
as
impressed
as
when
i
tried
it
on
tap
overall
this
is
something
ill
probably
have
again
tastes
a
bit
more
like
a
red
ale
than
an
amber
ale
to
me
with
a
bit
less
toasty
flavors
than
a
typical
amber
and
a
bit
more
hops
and
a
nutty
malt
presence
it
has
a
fairly
well
rounded
feel
and
carbonation
is
about
right
tastes
like
another
solid
offering
from
north
coast
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
awesome
this
beer
isnt
complex
but
it
just
had
this
freshness
to
it
that
i
havent
had
in
a
beer
for
a
while
it
reminded
me
of
my
first
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
only
better
i
loved
the
robust
flavors
of
this
beer
and
the
outstanding
overly
inviting
appearance
i
could
really
enjoy
a
couple
pints
of
this
stuff
on
any
given
day
this
beer
wont
leave
you
wanting
something
more
robust
its
full
flavored
yet
very
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
you
try
it
cheers
d
drinks
well
would
go
well
with
a
cheese
platter
not
too
rich
or
too
weak
thanks
for
reading
a
clear
light
red
body
with
good
carbonation
and
small
head
great
citric
hop
notes
as
some
sweet
malt
keeping
it
simple
this
beer
is
smooth
and
has
a
medium
body
the
hops
pass
easily
and
are
wellbalanced
with
a
chewey
semisweet
malt
base
that
still
has
some
carbonated
crispness
and
a
somewhat
dry
backbite
to
complement
the
beer
just
a
great
red
that
is
easily
sessionable
d
refreshing
and
very
nice
but
not
my
fave
drinkability
is
good
but
i
doubt
i
will
drink
this
beer
much
in
the
future
earthy
hop
with

finishes
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
warm
spice
good
session
beer
as
the
beer
warmed
malty
sweetness
became
more
apparent
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
one
red
seal
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
cramy
white
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
few
millimeters
thick
carbonation
is
vigorous
and
very
fine
very
nice
lacing
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
boquet
toast
and
toffee
are
on
the
forefront
with
floral
fruity
aromas
lingering
in
the
back
this
is
one
of
the
hoppier
reds
i
have
tried
sweet
maltiness
hits
the
tongue
with
flavors
of
freshbaked
bread
followed
by
a
clean
crisp
hop
finish
the
finish
is
reminiscent
of
fresh
fruit
yet
with
an
almost
steely
character
this
beer
is
very
clean
it
goes
in
and
the
flavors
only
last
while
on
the
palate
red
seal
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
of
ale
will
i
buy
it
again
most
definitely
d
so
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
so
smooth
and
subtle
with
its
complexity
not
your
average
american
amber
hop
flavor
is
amazingly
clean
and
complements
every
other
aspect
of
the
ale
brilliantly

the
red
seal
ale
is
very
drinkable
i
wanted
another
i
could
definitly
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
would
absolutly
have
one
or
two
again
definitely
a
style
im
beginning
to
enjoy
however
not
quite
as
hopassertive
as
green
flashs
hop
head
red
but
id
definitely
acquire
the
red
seal
again
as
an
easy
drinking
alternative
nice
hop
presence
solid
malt
base
neither
sweet
nor
dry
long
bitter
aftertaste
full
bodied
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
beer
the
drinkability
is
good
as
i
was
saying
before
about
it
being
polished
its
just
clearly
a
well
crafted
beer
a
red
for
people
who
arent
fans
of
reds
d
very
good
went
down
easily
with
a
slice
of
pizza
i
particularly
found
this
to
be
great
with
a
dark
fish
such
as
a
grainy
swordfish
or
salmon
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
quaffer
d
easy
to
drink
good
body
great
flavor
that
doesnt
overpower
and
a
perfectly
carbonated
example
of
a
red
ale
d
well
this
one
has
a
great
hop
nose
but
the
flavors
just
arent
very
pronounced
though
i
dont
believe
that
was
ever
the
intention
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
little
light
for
my
tastes
but
with
that
lightness
comes
an
easy
drinkability
very
sessionable
pours
to
a
generous
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
color
is
copperred
and
almost
crystal
clear
aroma
is
of
sweet
and
toasty
malt
and
citrus
hops
flavor
comes
on
strong
with
sweet
maltiness
balanced
by
a
solid
hop
bitterness
mediumlight
mouthfeel
easy
to
quaff
reminds
me
of
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
with
more
complexity
in
the
malt
good
call
on
tap
at
river
street
alehouse
for
2
during
happy
hour
served
in
a
standard
shaker
glass
appears
a
hazed
crimson
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
creamy
light
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
fruity
floral
hops
grapefruit
resinous
pine
bitter
lemon
and
sweet
caramelized
malts
and
grains
red
seal
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
pleasant
bitterness
stays
with
you
into
the
finish
another
good
one
from
north
coast
on
cask
at
hamiltons
a
nice
redish
hue
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
left
some
lace
but
not
a
lot
the
smell
wasnt
very
strong
and
it
was
really
hard
to
get
a
good
whiff
it
had
an
almost
milky
smooth
quality
to
it
it
was
very
very
smooth
but
not
very
flavorful
this
isnt
something
that
im
going
to
go
back
to
any
time
soon
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
to
be
perfectly
honest
good
reddish
hue
with
a
good
head
retention
and
lacing
appearance
is
fairly
hazy
excellent
aroma
its
apparent
that
theres
a
fair
amount
of
dry
hopping
flavor
is
predominantly
from
the
hops
with
a
light
maltiness
and
caramel
flavor
if
youre
a
fan
of
west
coast
style
ales
youll
enjoy
this
beer
for
those
of
us
in
light
lager
dominated
countries
its
an
absolute
treat
continuing
on
the
previous
theme
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
pleasant
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
ive
observed
with
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
albiet
a
small
amount
of
it
that
doesnt
leave
my
mouth
overly
sticky
and
dry
overall
the
delicious
moderate
nature
of
red
seal
ales
smell
taste
mouthfeel
and
abv
make
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
highly
recommended
poured
into
a
mug
as
a
reddish
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
frothy
white
head
smell
of
hops
is
apparent
as
it
poured
taste
started
with
some
creamy
with
some
sweetish
malts
evolves
into
a
bit
of
spice
and
then
finishes
off
dry
very
drinkable
my
glass
was
finished
before
i
realized
it
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
about
it
is
exceptionally
notable
appearance
pours
out
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
slim
head
smell
of
sweet
malts
with
hops
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
hops
giving
it
a
good
bite
piney
and
grapefruity
with
light
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
but
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
for
not
being
an
ipa
dnot
hard
to
finish
one
d
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
superbly
balanced
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
highly
recommended
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
room
temp
pint
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
decent
head
and
retention
smells
of
grapefruit
rind
and
honey
the
taste
is
very
interesting
definitely
has
some
stuff
going
on
here
nice
and
hoppy
with
sweetness
balanced
by
the
grapefruit
bitter
i
dont
know
exactly
where
the
sweetness
is
coming
from
but
it
has
kind
of
a
burnt
honey
flavor
that
is
quite
appealing
lingering
bitterness
at
the
end
feels
medium
bodied
fairly
carbonated
with
that
crisp
zing
at
the
finish
quite
drinkable
i
liked
the
flavor
and
really
havent
had
another
beer
like
this
to
compare
it
to
another
good
job
by
north
coast
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
very
tasty
pleasing
brew
balanced
with
a
nod
towards
the
hops
overall
a
highly
drinkable
beer
wonderfully
balanced
taste
and
flavor
and
a
barely
detectable
alcohol
sting
makes
this
an
easily
sessionable
beer
d
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
just
because
of
the
weak
taste
would
be
easy
to
suck
down
a
few
of
these
without
problem
but
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
overall
an
amazing
beer
this
beer
truely
defines
the
style
and
is
easily
sessionable
overall
this
is
pretty
powerful
for
a
red
its
like
a
big
slap
to
the
palate
the
hops
are
obvious
drinkability
is
great
a
very
balanced
beer
this
is
a
solid
onpoint
offering
from
north
coast
not
particularly
innovative
but
exactly
what
a
good
american
red
should
taste
like
d
its
a
decent
beer
the
hop
character
is
a
bit
too
raw
and
unpolished
overall
im
ery
pleased
with
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
flavorful
amber
that
doesnt
go
overboard
on
the
hops
and
lets
the
caramel
malts
do
their
work
very
nice
and
worth
a
shot
d
it
is
very
drinkable
i
need
to
go
get
a
sixer
will
i
buy
it
again
no
overall
there
isnt
much
here
it
was
okay
but
for
about
11
for
a
sixer
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
ive
had
this
many
times
maybe
possibly
in
the
past
they
had
twist
offs
im
impressed
with
this
one
a
solid
cap
definitely
a
session
beer
with
a
twist
nice
example
of
a
craft
pale
ale
i
will
drink
more
of
this
ah
good
not
spectacular
my
ability
to
drink
these
is
in
question
drinkability
good
overall
a
great
beer
one
that
i
will
surely
get
again
overall
where
the
hell
did
i
put
that
arrogant
bastard
big
old
head
of
two
to
three
fingers
mainly
comprised
of
a
sheet
of
micro
bubbles
with
larger
bubble
dimples
leaves
a
pretty
lacing
behind
sinewy
profile
in
the
nose
direct
and
to
the
point
scents
of
forest
floor
earth
and
underbrush
dried
grapefruit
and
lemon
peels
crème
brulée
and
unshucked
corn
the
dryness
gets
arch
at
moments
but
always
relents
a
general
maltiness
softens
the
dissolve
and
stifles
an
encroaching
salinity
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
more
of
a
big
expansive
foaminess
than
finer
prickle
pizza
crust
wheat
bread
general
toasted
dough
quite
prevalent
with
a
noticeable
grapefruit
orange
citrus
thrust
to
it
the
poor
brown
earth
stone
and
matted
grasses
components
evoke
a
meadow
field
the
dryness
begins
to
wear
out
the
palate
after
some
time
here
the
malts
a
little
roasted
to
smooth
out
the
ride
still
has
a
liveliness
to
it
and
certain
purity
of
spirit
could
put
down
23
of
these
before
having
to
switch
to
something
else
proof
that
a
complex
entertaining
beer
need
not
possess
an
offthecharts
abv
im
impressed
d
a
good
ale
that
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
everyday
ill
definitely
be
drinking
it
again
though
kinda
one
of
those
brews
that
when
it
happens
it
happens
not
really
gonna
hunt
for
it
again
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
enjoy
a
simple
balanced
amber
in
these
times
of
imperials
and
hop
head
infused
reds
d
a
fine
drink
of
beer
im
kicking
myself
for
not
trying
this
sooner
dotson
nikki
couldnt
get
a
clean
glass
has
a
smallish
head
in
the
dark
bottle
a
malty
sharp
flavor
with
a
somewhat
smooth
aftertaste
poured
a
little
cold
decided
to
try
it
again
after
warming
up
for
a
bit
warming
up
nice
malty
has
a
very
malty
aroma
smooth
and
creamy
very
crisp
solid
beer
very
drinkable
d
a
tad
too
bitter
for
my
liking
but
yet
a
respectable
brew
the
taste
is
quite
memorable
but
the
beer
slightly
dissappoints
in
all
other
facets
off
the
tap
at
the
daily
planet
this
beer
was
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
offwhite
head
that
displayed
moderate
retention
and
left
broken
bands
of
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
very
appealing
balance
of
floral
and
slightly
herbal
hops
with
rich
malt
the
flavors
were
also
well
balanced
and
i
instantly
thought
session
beer
wet
grains
slightly
musty
malt
toasted
malt
and
some
hints
of
wood
balanced
by
a
bold
hoppiness
on
the
finish
crisp
and
solid
and
a
great
flagship
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
a
little
fizzyfoamy
due
to
the
carbonation
a
tap
thing
and
the
body
was
medium
really
nice
overall
nothing
really
struck
me
as
spectacular
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
would
do
well
during
any
season
might
also
be
an
admirable
gateway
beer
for
a
neophyte
one
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
this
is
the
perfect
domestic
session
beer
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
yet
the
alcohol
is
low
enough
that
you
could
kick
back
a
couple
of
pitchers
of
this
stuff
with
your
mates
if
i
was
going
to
be
around
for
the
superbowl
you
better
believe
this
is
what
i
would
be
drinking
impressive
d
lingering
dryness
is
borderline
sessionable
for
me
very
well
balanced
tho
light
copper
color
with
a
medium
to
thin
light
tan
head
aroma
is
citrus
hops
piney
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
lightly
grainy
with
some
roasty
and
light
caramel
notes
and
a
decent
northwest
hop
presence
to
keep
it
pretty
dry
finishes
hoppy
but
not
too
crisp
or
bitter
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
initial
head
smell
is
nice
and
malty
taste
is
very
refreshing
nice
carbonation
and
malty
undertones
feel
is
great
and
i
could
drink
several
of
these
not
a
ton
of
original
character
but
sometimes
its
good
to
have
a
beer
that
isnt
intensely
flavorful
and
is
just
a
good
pleasant
drink
8
bucks
a
sixpack
ill
be
getting
more
this
beer
has
a
fine
drinkability
and
would
be
a
great
accompanyment
to
a
hearty
meal
drinkability
high
because
nothing
is
too
overwhelming
most
will
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
because
its
in
no
way
offputting
or
obnoxious
kind
of
like
the
name
poured
amber
with
a
half
finger
of
fine
bubbled
head
smelled
pungent
and
earthy
medium
impression
of
hops
and
light
malt
roasting
drank
clean
but
i
didnt
crave
another
i
recall
liking
this
more
in
the
past
perhaps
the
hops
have
changed
d
good
esp
for
the
abv
a
bit
sweet
for
me
for
too
many
overall
a
very
good
beer
tastes
like
an
amber
ale
should
and
would
stack
up
with
the
best
of
them
but
if
you
are
looking
for
complexity
look
elsewhere
decent
feel
and
drink
per
se
carbonation
is
high
initially
yet
settles
in
the
end
leaving
a
somewhat
viscous
finish
the
beer
poured
a
light
copper
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
simply
of
malt
the
taste
is
light
malt
with
no
real
hops
flavor
but
it
is
evident
in
the
dry
finish
the
feel
is
medium
and
dry
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
most
pleasant
session
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
i
know
ill
be
drinking
more
in
the
future
on
draft
at
my
local
last
week
man
what
a
nice
beer
the
aroma
of
malt
and
a
good
hit
of
citrusy
hops
was
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
like
a
good
english
bitter
and
it
tasted
as
close
to
meantime
ipa
as
i
have
found
in
the
states
a
great
session
beer
with
that
elusive
moreishness
that
a
good
beer
should
have
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
overall
impression
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
classic
american
pale
there
is
a
bit
more
hops
than
i
would
expect
in
an
amber
but
that
is
just
a
quibble
on
the
classification
very
nice
very
drinkable

overall
a
very
good
example
of
a
west
coast
red
ale
pours
a
orange
amber
with
just
a
hint
of
red
the
creamy
bone
colored
cap
is
a
little
smallbut
retains
well
for
the
style
it
leaves
a
quarter
inch
cap
that
is
still
hanging
strong
and
leaving
some
patchy
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
underlying
floracitrusy
hoppy
aromas
lots
of
bread
crust
flavors
here
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
a
nice
balance
that
leans
slightly
toward
the
citrusy
bitter
flavors
the
mouthfeel
has
kind
of
a
dirty
dry
feeland
borders
on
very
dry
if
readily
available
in
your
area
red
seal
could
be
a
good
friend
overall
this
beer
as
an
astringent
mouth
feel
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
but
acceptable
with
this
style
of
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
off
the
shelf
it
pours
a
beautiful
clear
amber
color
with
a
huge
creamy
thick
foamy
off
white
head
that
laces
and
retains
very
well
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
just
perfect
there
are
very
nice
bready
malts
enticing
caramel
hints
all
rounded
out
with
a
great
hop
presence
the
taste
is
fantastic
this
is
a
great
beer
it
comes
off
a
little
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
amber
as
there
arent
any
of
the
tart
reddish
notes
in
the
flavor
characteristic
of
the
red
style
this
is
a
creamy
bready
earthy
malt
beer
with
a
very
well
balanced
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
leaves
just
a
slight
bittering
hop
presence
and
there
is
little
aftertaste
noticeable
lchaim
this
beer
has
great
balance
very
smooth
from
front
to
back
it
has
a
very
beautiful
honey
amber
appearance
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
pretty
strong
lacing
as
well
smells
very
apple
like
with
strong
scents
of
pine
sugary
orange
bright
citrus
theres
also
a
hint
of
minty
like
cleaness
similar
to
how
spearmint
gum
makes
your
mouth
feel
fresh
like
i
said
its
one
of
the
most
balanced
ipa
type
beers
ive
tried
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
hop
bite
nor
a
ton
of
malty
sweetness
but
it
seems
to
blend
the
two
perfectly
with
the
hops
dominating
in
the
end
with
that
said
the
sweetness
never
totally
goes
away
its
midbodied
in
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
very
smooth
coats
the
tongue
and
tingles
nicely
good
beer
great
brewery
definitely
try
the
old
rasputin
and
old
stock
ale
that
north
coast
puts
out
both
are
excellent
too
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
color
with
a
thin
foamy
offwhite
head
aroma
and
flavor
both
consist
of
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
very
drinkable
session
beer
that
starts
off
smooth
and
finishes
off
with
a
dry
hoppy
bitterness
this
ale
rises
above
the
current
glut
of
amber
ales
available
due
to
the
pleasant
bitterness
that
complements
the
rich
malty
profile
i
place
it
along
side
my
favorite
amber
bells
amber
ale
north
coast
offers
a
solid
lineup
of
beers
including
some
red
seal
ale
among
them
that
should
appeal
to
the
palate
of
any
beer
drinker
no
matter
their
tastes
or
experience
this
is
beer
done
well
period
like
id
recommend
their
old
rasputin
and
old
stock
to
those
learning
to
become
connoisseurs
out
there
id
recommend
this
as
a
first
step
along
the
way
good
drinkable
amber
but
not
the
hardest
beer
to
get
down
for
someone
looking
at
a
good
staple
beer
gives
a
sweet
peachy
smell
that
combines
what
it
says
on
the
label
of
water
barley
hops
yeast
and
thats
all
as
said
above
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
mixture
of
hops
the
sweeter
taste
of
heavier
malt
and
semidry
bitterness
that
ends
with
a
floral
nose
as
you
set
it
down
thinking
of
the
next
one
expensive
though
for
its
price
in
mo
for
9
50
a
six
pack
d
quite
sessionable
esp
w
some
spicy
food
could
easily
become
a
staple
very
satisfying
from
a
12
oz
bottle
purchased
locally
aroma
is
caramel
and
pine
color
is
a
copper
amber
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
crystal
clear
malty
and
toasty
but
with
bitterness
to
back
it
up
some
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
with
more
pine
and
citrus
medium
bodied
and
dries
in
the
finish
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
amber
ales
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
fairly
full
all
and
all
i
would
finish
the
6
pack
but
doubt
i
would
buy
it
again
north
coast
has
other
brews
that
tickle
my
palate
more
than
this
particular
brew
this
soft
pretzelhued
ale
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
when
i
compared
aroma
to
taste
it
smelled
nice
and
hoppy
with
juicy
orange
scent
the
beers
flavor
profile
was
very
much
more
balanced
leaving
the
hop
blast
forgotten
in
the
creamy
maltiness
there
was
a
whisper
of
hop
acid
but
it
was
overpowered
by
a
significant
metallic
twang
some
buttery
biscuit
in
there
too
smooth
enough
to
drink
several
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
my
attention
i
would
like
this
with
a
grilled
panini
sandwich
or
maybe
a
casual
thincrust
cheese
pizza
definitely
worth
trying
an
exceptional
interpretation
of
a
red
ale
impressive
taste
impressive
mouthfeel
and
overall
pretty
dang
impressive
north
coast
never
fails
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
red
as
i
prefer
a
bit
maltier
and
sweeter
but
its
an
impressive
interpretation
and
gives
some
great
variety
to
the
usual
amberred
category
go
give
it
a
shot
md
way
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
i
think
it
slightly
took
away
from
the
beers
character
but
the
texture
and
abv
make
this
a
sessionable
beer
by
any
definition
i
just
wish
that
i
had
bought
more
than
2
bottles
overall
i
was
rather
impressed
by
the
appearance
and
smell
but
then
was
just
let
down
with
the
taste
despite
this
still
is
great
session
beer
nice
that
this
is
now
available
at
our
local
government
liqour
stores
as
it
is
a
great
session
beer
malty
in
profile
but
with
plenty
of
hops
on
the
finish
this
is
a
well
made
drinking
beer
that
has
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
add
this
to
alaskan
amber
full
sail
amber
and
fat
tire
as
great
drinking
beers
from
the
u
s
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
american
pale
ale
the
balance
between
malt
and
hops
is
spot
on
this
could
be
my
new
go
to
beersorry
sierra
nevada
if
it
was
more
available
in
my
area
the
places
that
do
sell
red

dont
sell
it

you
need
a

cooler
trader
joes
drinkability
a
great
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
as
is
my
tradition
i
tend
to
drink
beers
with
red
in
the
name
during
nebraska
cornhusker
football
season
this
red
seal
ale
fits
the
bill
and
i
find
myself
going
for
it
this
fall
i
have
been
able
to
get
this
for
7

a
six
not
a
bad
deal
the
taste
has
very
light
malty
sweetness
mostly
caramelly
fruit
with
mild
but
far
more
dominant
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
mostly
grapefruit
with
some
other
citrus
and
a
light
stale
piney
quality
the
bitterness
is
not
strong
in
absolute
terms
but
it
certainly
dominates
the
whole
beer
since
the
body
is
thin
the
malt
exceedingly
weak
it
lacks
compelxity
and
its
watery
and
bland
with
a
thin
character
completely
lacking
anything
underneath
the
thin
surface
flavours
it
seems
thin
and
has
an
old
stale
quality
which
makes
no
sense
given
my
proximity
to
the
brewery
and
its
presnece
in
the
region
a
hazy
light
amber
beer
with
a
nice
diminishing
head
can
definitely
pick
up
some
citrus
tones
in
the
scent
tastes
just
great
just
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
very
well
balanced
im
loving
that
grapefruitcitrus
aftertaste
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
had
expected
but
very
high
drinkability
cheers
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
but
seems
a
bit
heavy
good
example
of
an
american
amber
pours
a
hazy
reddish
amber
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
citrus
like
a
fresh
grapefruit
taste
is
also
very
citrusy
with
a
nice
toasty
malt
middle
and
a
light
piney
finish
nice
bitterness
that
clings
to
your
tounge
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
levels
medium
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sitting
around
and
relaxing
one
of
the
best
red
ales
ive
had
tastes
a
lot
like
an
american
pale
ale
too
imo
d
certainly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
im
not
a
big
fan
of
amber
ales
but
this
one
is
better
than
most
drinkability
easy
drinking
drinkability
definitely
not
true
to
its
style
tastes
more
like
a
pale
ale
if
it
werent
for
the
stinging
carbonation
this
one
would
rank
much
higher
d
i
cant
describe
this
beer
particularly
well
the
taste
and
smell
are
great
but
not
terribly
powerful
making
it
a
great
session
beer
picked
a
sixpack
off
the
shelf
not
knowing
what
to
expect
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
taste
full
mouth
feel
with
a
large
rich
malt
flavor
this
bier
has
a
more
hoppy
taste
than
i
thought
from
the
smell
with
a
slight
hint
of
grapefruit
this
bier
drinks
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
slight
bitter
back
end
i
real
enjoyed
drinking
this
bier
and
will
definitely
have
it
again

the
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
mix
of
fresh
hops
and
sweet
malt
its
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
alcohol
and
still
rich
in
taste
and
character
its
great
in
the
summer
as
well
as
on
a
rainy
autumn
day
md
light
to
medium
bodied
a
touch
thin
crisp
and
smooth
and
very
drinkable
d
abover
average
nice
session
brew
very
good
and
not
overly
hopped
could
go
for
more
complexity
with
this
one
it
kind
of
just
is
what
it
is
feel
is
maybe
a
bit
too
thin
for
the
style
but
not
too
bad
at
the
same
time
carbonation
makes
up
for
it
drinkability
very
good
have
been
impressed
by
all
of
north
coasts
beers
so
far
just
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
in
my
area
a
nice
amber
ale
from
north
coast
more
subtle
and
pleasing
than
the
average

d
i
suspect
this
to
be

refreshing
brew
for

which
surprises
me
as
an
amber
is
not
usually
my
first
choice
for
something
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
venture
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
in
the
us
if
not
the
world
its
light
smooth
enough
for
regular
enjoyment
with
enough
malt
hops
as
to
not
grow
boring
extremely
wellbalanced
wellrounded
brew
overall
more
hoppy
than
youd
expect
from
an
american
amber
thats
for
sure
but
even
with
that
in
mind
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
nice
bear
overall
and
will
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
drinkability
a
nice
light
bodied
well
made
with
good

that
is
not
too
overpowering
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
drinkability
is
definitely
high
despite
the
hoppiness
this
is
very
smooth
and
for
only
5
5
abv
nearly
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
i
like
it
only
other
experience
with
north
coast
is

and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
some
good
flavors
and
a
nice
hoppy

i
really
like
this
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
and
can
usually
be
found
in

with

and
slight

notes
with

a

on
the
lighter
side

with
a
fair

which
is
just
subtle
enough
to
enhance
the

superdrinkable
though
not
so
much
so
that
any
of
the
other
attributes
most
notably
flavor
take
a
back
seat
unbelievable
practically
perfect
in
every
imaginable
way
tastes
to
me
like
homebrewing
smells
for
the
style
and
for
any
beer
this
is
about
as
perfect
as
they
come
its
the
first
perfect
5
i
have
ever
given
amazing
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
really
well
could
be
fairly
sessionable
as
the
hoppiness
is
well
balanced
d
crisp
and
refreshing
the
simplest
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
would
make
a
fine
session
brew
but
wouldnt
stand
out
in
a
crowd
found
warm
in
acton
at
colonial
spirits
great
road
pours
a
medium
amber
color
good
clarity
with
just
a
fingers
worth
of
offwhite
head
aromas
are
extremely
hoppy
all
pine
and
herbal
with
little
grapefruit
or
other
citrus
im
struggling
to
find
any
malt
notes
but
getting
just
a
touch
of
dark
crystal
malt
sweetness
coming
through
on
the
palate
however
the
malts
make
themselves
much
more
present
rich
munich
and
crystal
malts
really
round
out
this
beer
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
finish
hop
flavor
is
quite
a
bit
more
muted
than
the
aroma
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
spot
on
for
style
this
is
quite
a
nice
drinker
next
to
st
rogue
red
for
my
favorite
very
high
drinkability
i
could
hit
these
all
day
well
balanced
american
amber
ale
that
is
drinkable
enough
to
order
a
few
pints
none
the
less
i
prefer
a
bit
more
character
from
hops
and
malts
in
my
amber
ales
pretty
good
served
a

with
a
nice
head
that
lasted
as
a
thin
layer
and
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
citrus
hops
and
pale
malts
the
taste
was
a
nice
crisp
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
sharp
citrus
hops
the
beer
is
very
light
and
refreshing
and
almost
perfect
for
summer
weather
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
amber
ale
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
however
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
in
the
market
due
to
the
predominant
bitterness
rides
a
fine
line
between
approachable
and
something
more
challenging
which
is
exactly
what
i
think
of
with
this
style
i
could
easily
bring
a
6pack
of
this
to
a
party
and
enjoy
it
all
night
amazing
balance
its
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
and
malty
but
not
too
sweet
more
hop
character
than
most
canadian
ipas
and
better
too
the
ale
is
slightly
red
with
more
brownish
colours
the
head
was
about
a
centimeter
in
height
with
a
bit
of
retention
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
of
sweet
malts
with
hints
of
hops
the
beer
tastes
of
sweet
malts
with
a
nice
bittering
from
the
hops
to
finish
the
beer
it
is
very
balanced
and
smooth
the
sweet
malts
are
quite
tasty
and
make
the
beer
drinkable
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
slightly
carbonated
this
is
my
type
of
red
ale
nice
and
hoppy
but
a
great
sweet
malt
to
go
behind
it
mouthfeel
is
tight
and
clean
goes
down
very
easily
lending
to
a
high
drinkability
d
very
good
example
of
a
good
beer
without
being
as
overpowering
or
strong
as
an
ipa
a
great
introduction
to
craft
beers
for
those
who
arent
very
experienced
d
pretty
aggressive
for
a
red
even
in
america
similar
to
hoppus
maximus
in
sheer
hop
force
easy
in
session
due
to
relatively
low
abv
i
finally
got
to
use
my
red
seal
pint
glass
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
to
it
head
was
initially
3
fingers
but
dropped
down
to
1
and
consisted
of
off
white
foam
almost
like
a
meringue
that
clung
very
well
to
the
sides
aroma
was
hoppy
maybe
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
reminded
a
bit
of
a
good
deli
pickle
for
some
reason
tasted
initially
sweet
then
shifted
to
buttermilk
pancake
then
became
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lacking
considering
the
initial
sweetness
it
was
a
little
too
watery
for
a
beer
that
tasted
this
way
very
easy
to
drink
probablly
go
down
much
faster
than
expected
d
drinkability
is
quite
good
it
tastes
good
smells
good
feels
good
that
pretty
much
drives
the
point
home
the
low
alcohol
combined
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
really
makes
this
one
a
solid
beer
from
the
north
coast
brewing
co
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
in
their
red
ale
drinkability
not
like
you
had
to
choke
it
down
but
it
wasnt
all
that
special
either
nothing
really
superb
or
really
bad
either
just
pretty
good
d
goodness
gracious
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
could
drink
several
of
this
superlative
ale
north
coast
has
to
be
one
of
if
not
the
finest
brewery
in
america
appearance
is
a
deep
orangy
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
dissolves
down
to
a
thick
film
leaving
some
light
lacing
as
the
beer
drains
into
my
belly
lots
of
fruity
hops
and
caramel
malt
almost
a
perfect
balance
flavor
is
likewise
this
is
really
an
excellent
oh
i
thought
it
was
an
apa
but
apparently
not
in
any
case
its
delicious
a
nice
explosion
of
fruity
hop
bitterness
mixed
well
with
smooth
malt
man
this
is
drinkable
had
this
on
tap
before
and
thought
it
was
delicious
then
as
well
a
good
session
if
a
little
high
in
abv
and
also
good
for
a
hot
day
notes
this
became
an
automatic
staplebut
not
easy
to
find
i
will
buy
this
as
often
as
possible
because
it
is
so
well
balanced
and
so
good
i
try
a
lot
of
beers
and
this
beer
is
just
so
enticing
taste
is
very
refreshing
this
beer
has
that
nice
crisp
and
fresh
tastes
of
hops
but
not
that
mouth
puckering
intensity
of
an
india
pale
ale
the
main
tastes
i
get
are
floral
hops
and
some
powdered
sugar
sweetness
nothing
too
intense
the
malt
backs
it
well
and
makes
this
a
very
balanced
beer
this
is
a
simple
yet
very
delicious
ale
i
want
more
oh
how
i
want
more
d
excellent
brew
and
worthy
of
a
slower
session
flavorful
and
sessionable
kinda
reminds
me
a
little
of
sn
celebration
d
easy
to
drink
except
for
the
heaviness
something
ill
be
looking
forward
to
in
the
future
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
be
back
for
more
its
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
to
come
across
it
ddarn
close
to
perfectly
suiting
my
palate
seems
better
than
the
last
time
i
tried
it
outstanding
d
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
sometime
it
has
a
good
taste
to
it
worth
a
try
pours
a
slight
hue
darker
than
a
regular
pale
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
a
little
different
on
the
nose
really
showing
pineapple
rind
as
the
dominate
characteristic
brown
sugar
and
subdued
red
apples
on
the
background
palate
shows
about
the
same
as
the
nose
but
on
a
little
darker
side
with
a
little
bit
more
scorched
malt
characteristic
the
hops
were
pretty
well
infused
behind
the
malts
to
show
a
lively
character
from
midpalate
to
the
finish
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
different
type
of
a
pale
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
long
time
a
very
worthy
pale
ale
for
those
who
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
this
seems
to
be
a
step
above
very
nice
apa
and
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
frequently
single
bottle
from
trader
joes
cary
an
old
favorite
over
all
a
slightly
aboveaverage
apa
very
drinkable
worth
trying
but
not
the
most
intriguing
apa
for
me
this
is
the
apa
against
which
i
will
judge
all
other
apas
it
is
in
no
way
overthetop
unlike
some
apas
which
give
me
the
distinct
impression
that
the
brewer
fell
asleep
at
the
hoppitching
switch
allowing
gallons
and
gallons
of
hops
to
enter
into
the
brew
red
seal
is
perfectly
balanced
and
nuanced
nothing
unpleasant
or
brash
or
harsh
at
all
nice
complex
hop
notes
this
is
one
to
satisfy
the
hop
head
and
the
traditionalist
alike
bravo
this
beer
seems
to
have
good
balance
i
wish
that
i
had
one
more
sip
left
to
take
in
the
whole
thing
one
more
time
but
alas
there
is
no
more
drinkability
thoroughly
drinkable
this
is
very
tasty
pale
ale
i
will
gladly
and
easily
work
my
way
through
a
six
pack
i
especially
like
the
presence
of
malts
here
as
it
gives
it
an
overall
more
balanced
flavorsomething
you
dont
regularly
get
with
a
pale
ale
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mediumlight
bodied
with
higher
levels
of
carbonation
than
the
previous
two
though
given
the
lighter
body
it
seems
appropriate
this
beer
goes
down
easily
enough
and
i
do
recommend
it
however
it
is
as
i
have
said
previously
in
this
sessionthe
horizontal
tasting
it
is
just
another
one
of
the
guys
worth
checking
out
but
it
isnt
good
enough
to
get
me
to
buy
it
again
im
glad
that
i
did
give
it
a
try
by
no
means
do
i
not
like
it
but
as
far
as
this
style
goes
ive
had
beers
that
i
found
to
be
much
hoppier
and
much
betterall
around
smells
of
orange
spice
slightly
metallic
some
hops
lingering
in
background
palate
is
simple
and
satisfying
lively
carbonation
creamy
texture
nice
drybitter
finish
slightly
toasted
grainy
malts
kick
it
off
a
good
dose
of
hops
in
middle
and
short
metalic
finish
some
sweeter
candy
notes
slight
lagerbelgian
taste
this
was
a
typical
pale
ale
the
flavor
was
pretty
onedimensional
with
decent
hops
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
bitterness
pretty
easily
drinkable
but
there
just
wasnt
much
to
it
id
call
it
average
drunk
from
a
bottle
so
i
dont
have
any
notes
on
the
appearance
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
apas
it
has
a
pretty
bitter
taste
but
its
likable
nonetheless
mmm
very
drinkable
i
think
the
bitterness
would
be
a
little
drying
later
on
in
a
session
but
pleasant
and
enjoyable
in
moderation
recommended
one
of
the
better
pales
i
have
had
lately
md
a
we
bit
strong
on
the
bitter
do
to
the
huge
amount
of
hops
but
i
would
not
take
that
away
since
the
flavor
was
so
good
other
than
that
it
had
a
great
feel
in
the
mouth
and
i
really
want
to
drink
this
one
again
and
again
ill
also
be
trying
many
more
beers
from
this
brewer
they
definitely
know
what
they
are
doing
definitely
recommended
this
poured
a
beautiful
copperred
color
with
nice
head
that
lasted
a
while
smell
is
a
pleasing
blend
of
hoppy
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
a
wellbalanced
blend
of
initial
maltiness
that
subsides
to
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
good
as
it
has
a
thick
chewy
character
to
it
drinkabilty
is
high
well
what
can
i
say
ive
liked
and
enjoyed
this
beer
before
but
sitting
down
with
a
review
copy
and
thinking
about
the
beer
as
a
whole
has
made
me
see
it
as
one
of
the
weaker
offerings
in
north
coasts
lineup
drinkable
sure
yeah
i
could
do
another
but
i
can
think
of
a
handful
of
other
pale
ales
apas
or
otherwise
that
id
prefer
a
second
round
of
d
not
bad
just
not
complex
enough
to
hold
my
interest
if
youre
bored
of
the
cookie
cutter
apas
give
this
one
a
shot
d
its
an
ok
beer
if
thirst
was
an
issue
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
but
otherwise
i
wouldent
buy
it
poured
red
with
an
inch
or
two
white
head
smelled
of
grapefruit
taste
was
grapefruit
hops
with
a
hint
of
pine
and
a
sweet
caramel
undercurrent
not
much
going
on
here
three
floyds
and
mad
river
have
really
impressed
recently
with
pale
ales
this
not
so
much
not
something
im
looking
forward
to
having
again
da
smooth
drink
that
is
very
agreeable
on
fist
taste
the
maltiness
comes
throuogh
followed
by
the
hops
and
a
bitter
dry
finish
as
it
warms
though
all
the
flavors
come
out
to
play
pear
apple
nice
slightly
roasted
maltiness
and
good
hops
undertones
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
dont
know
if
i
would
crave
this
beer
a
lot
but
after
ive
had
one
another
one
sounds
darn
good
i
must
admit
i
do
like
this
brew
id
certainly
have
another
and
would
love
to
try
it
straight
from
the
tap
maybe
the
next
time
im
in
california
ill
be
able
to
indulge
in
a
pint
great
stuff
definitely
recommended
cheers
this
beer
is
a
nice
reddish
amber
drink
with
loads
of
floral
hops
and
a
great
balanced
caramel
malt
backbone
crackers
pours
it
in
a
big
20
ounce
pint
which
is
just
enough
to
make
me
want
another
north
coast
brewing
has
a
good
roster
of
beers
and
red
seal
is
the
best
daily
drinker
of
the
bunch
perfect
with
food
perfect
without
food
just
about
perfect
i
had
this
one
on
cask
at
the
brewery
i
was
supraised
by
the
level
of
carbonation
there
was
more
than
i
expected
there
were
tons
of
really
small
bubbles
and
a
decent
head
that
lingered
through
the
whole
pint
it
poured
a
light
amber
color
somewhat
cloudy
though
the
aroma
was
much
more
intense
than
this
same
beer
in
a
bottle
or
on
tap
the
hops
really
shine
and
have
an
intense
floral
citrus
smell
and
taste
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
made
even
better
by
the
cask
presentation
d
this
red
seal
ale
is
extremely
drinkable
it
is
crisp
and
fresh
tasting
enough
for
a
hot
summer
day
yet
has
enough
flavor
and
body
to
be
great
choice
yearround
orange
amber
pour
with
a
really
nice
big
offwhite
fluffy
creamy
head
mildly
sweet
nicely
soapy
piney
hopped
big
smell
taste
is
a
nice
mild
hop
taste
and
a
sweet
caramel
backing
and
a
very
smooth
creamy
yet
nicely
carbonated
great
beer
mild
bitter
finish
on
a
great
all
around
pale
ale
and
one
i
will
definitely
have
again
drinkablity
very
tasty
and
sessionable
good
flavor
and
consistency
overall
this
beer
is
fairly
decent
the
toastiness
of
the
malts
rounds
the
beer
out
i
think
the
hop
profile
could
be
a
little
bit
more
aggressive
did
i
get
an
old
bottle
i
feel
bad
about
all
the
5s
but
for
a
pale
ale
this
brew
excelled
in
many
categories
it
has
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
of
an
american
red
except
with
all
the
flavor
that
an
a
r
generally
lacks
in
my
opinion
despite
the
metallic
aftertaste
the
rest
of
the
beer
excels
in
its
style
making
me
wonder
why
i
dont
see
more
of
this
on
tap
in
chicago
distribution
if
we
can
ever
rectify
the
distribution
conundrum
faced
by
my
city
i
would
appreciate
more
of
this
pale
ale
in
my
bars
over
the
summer
cheers
drinkability
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
balance
but
not
bad
overall
have
been
meaning
to
get
around
to
this
one
always
catches
my
eye
when
im
browsing
but
for
some
reason
or
another
i
always
pass
it
up
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
sticks
thick
with
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
citrus
and
hops
and
faint
malts
in
the
background
theres
a
little
sourness
coming
through
wait
no
thats
my
beard
damn
a
slither
of
sweetness
comes
out
upon
the
first
taste
second
taste
reveals
faint
spice
orange
peel
and
tea
the
hops
arent
too
big
leaving
this
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
ipa
that
would
be
perfect
for
sessioning
after
youve
finished
with
the
big
beers
defintely
going
to
be
purchasing
again
so
long
as
i
can
find
it
appeared
to
be
the
last
6
pack
a
very
good
session
beer
quite
flavorful
and
satisfying
but
it
doesnt
become
cloying
alcohol
is
restrained
so
i
can
have
a
couple
for
lunch
and
then
go
back
to
work
d
i
am
soooo
glad
this
beer
is
finally
available
locally
this
is
one
of
the
best
west
coast
pales
i
have
had
hazy
copper
color
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
very
nice
sticky
lacing
that
really
clings
to
the
glass
nice
fresh
hop
smell
very
floral
with
some
citrus
note
strong
biscuit
malt
background
taste
follows
suit
medium
body
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
for
some
reason
i
wasnt
expecting
something
this
enjoyable
a
nice
drinking
apa
overall
a
really
good
apa
i
liked
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
this
is
my
first
6er
of
red
seal
but
i
will
definitely
buy
more
in
the
future
d
very
high
on
this
one
easy
to
consume
and
enjoy
this
will
be
a
definite
staple
in
my
fridge
from
now
on
highly
recommended
d
sweet
and
it
was
6
99
the
aroma
is
floral
hoppy
with
a
slight
malt
smell
and
a
honey
in
the
finish
of
smell
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
smooth
and
cool
it
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
mouth
feel
it
leaves
a
nice
bitterness
all
around
the
inside
of
the
mouth
a
malty
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
and
enjoy
it
any
time
of
the
year

goes

finishes
nicely
a
nice
pale
ale
very
drinkable
not
quite
as
awesome
as
some
others
ive
had
though
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
surprise
given
the
underwhelming
smell
it
has
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
work
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
overly
sweet
beers
and
this
one
starts
down
that
road
but
is
saved
by
the
hops
on
the
finish
ends
up
be
a
fairly
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
beer
drinkability
comes
of
as
an
ale
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
a
numerous
amount
of
occasions
however
fails
to
become
a
prime
choice
due
to
its
artificial
aftertaste
although
an
apa
in
style
red
seal
has
stylistically
always
fooled
me
into
believing
it
was
a
british
style
esb
and
while
i
wont
split
hairs
i
will
get
down
to
the
bar
and
have
another
pint
of
this
before
a
new
beer
replaces
it
in
the
rotation
its
well
worth
seeking
out
on
draught
and
worth
paying
the
premium
price
i
paid
for
it
as
well
recommended
north
coast
is
a
class
act
i
enjoy
red
seal
often
and
for
some
strange
reason
it
is
available
in
boise
often
on
cask
now
that
is
all
together
a
different
story
a
fresh
cask
and
my
above
compliments
are
racheted
up
at
least
a
grade
this
another
brew
that
i
introduce
my
macro
friends
to
and
while
it
may
be
a
little
much
at
first
by
the
time
it
warms
up
a
bit
everyone
is
always
throwing
out
praise
now
somebody
just
needs
to
hook
me
up
with
the
barrel
aged
old
stock
and
i
will
be
a
very
happy
camper
any
takers
poured

a
dark
murky

color
with
a
thinned

the
citrus
aromas
with
it
had
lemonlike
flavors
very
heavily
floating
from
it
the
drink
had
a
perfect
sourbitter
balance
it
also
had
a
medium
body
that
gave
it
an
average
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
pale
ale

a
fine
pale
ale

just
a
little
more
hops
are
required

amotherfuckingone
a
light
amber
color
with
a
quater
inch
off
white
colored
head
forms
the
scent
of
malt
comes
out
at
the
start
then
it
is
followed
by
the
dominate
aroma
of
citrus
abd
pine
that
hits
the
nose
and
lingers
there
for
some
time
the
taste
is
a
bit
surprising
it
starts
with
a
citru
bitterness
nothing
to
strong
or
overbearing
that
is
followed
by
a
malt
mildness
that
hits
halfway
across
the
palate
this
flavor
dominates
till
almost
very
end
then
the
bitterness
brings
itself
out
again
at
the
end
the
feel
is
very
medium
bodied
at
the
start
and
as
it
crosses
the
palate
it
gains
some
heftness
to
its
texture
there
is
also
the
slight
tingle
of
carbonation
at
the
back
end
a
fairly
decent
beer
very
solid
aroma
is
almost
let
down
by
an
inconsistant
flavor
the
feel
is
let
down
a
bit
by
the
carboanation
though
it
does
seem
i
being
negative
to
this
beer
it
still
is
better
than
the
average
brew
out
there
this
has
potential
to
become
a
go
to
beer
final
thoughts

very
nice
complex
brew
d
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
less
and
less
the
more
i
drank
of
it
not
bad
just
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
i
think
not
bad
fits
d
amazing
smell
and
great
taste
but
i
think
id
get
bored
trying
to
drink
a
whole
sixpack
in
a
night
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
redorange
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
of
very
well
balanced
but
with
enough
hops
to
make
it
very
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
apa
it
is
endlessly
sessionable
with
enough
character
to
remain
interesting
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
caramel
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
piney
hops
tastes
of
caramel
malts
and
has
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
and
just
a
tad
of
sweetness
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
would
reccomend
this
to
anybody
d
taste
is
on
the
subtle
side
but
its
definitely
not
tasteless
controlled
would
be
a
good
way
to
describe
it
this
would
make
a
great
introduction
brew
and
an
excellent
session
beer
it
poured
an
amber
with
about
a
fingerhead
that
didnt
last
for
long
the
smell
reminded
me
very
much
of
malts
with
just
a
little
bit
of
citrus
sweetness
flowers
and
yeast
the
taste
is
very
robust
with
the
malts
being
very
present
and
the
hops
only
appearing
to
me
as
a
little
bitterness
towards
the
end
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
that
leaves
an
aftetaste
that
i
didnt
find
to
be
entirely
pleasant
the
carbonation
in
it
was
interesting
and
different
since
the
bubbles
seemed
to
be
quite
a
bit
smaller
than
normal
that
provided
a
different
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
the
drinkablity
is
pretty
standard
but
it
seems
to
be
sitting
a
little
heavier
in
me
than
most
ales
this
was
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
i
cant
imagine
picking
it
up
again
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
a
good
beer
that
just
isnt
for
me
more
like
a
mild
version
of
a
west
coast
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
if
you
ask
me
but
overall
certainly
a
quality
ale
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
but
still
a
bit
thin
nice
american
pale
ale
im
curious
how
many
unwary
customers
buy
this
thinking
they
are
getting
a
redamber
ale
and
wind
up
with
a
hoppy
pale
ale
personally
id
rather
have
a
hoppy
pale
ale
any
day
of
the
week
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
as
its
both
a
satisfying
pale
ale
and
also
would
be
a
decent
standin
for
an
ipa
if
the
selection
is
lackluster
or
none
are
available
i
would
like
to
say
what
happened
to
this
beer

and
one
thatd
be
good

convertees
to
i
need
to
find
this
on
tap
i
was
pretty
unimpressed
with
this
north
coast
offering
it
may
be
due
in
part
because
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
alpha
king
and
gd
fresh
hop
so
thats
not
really
fair
a
drinkable
easy
to
find
beer
just
not
very
interesting
overall
the
maltiest
apa
ive
ever
had
i
think
i
wonder
if
this
is
an
older
bottle
where
the
hops
have
mellowed
out
very
nice
though
very
good
balance
d
a
quaffer
to
be
sure
always
thought
this
was
a
red
ale
what
ever
the
hell
you
call
itits
damn
tasty
no
flaws
a
good
everyday
choice
this
beer
pours

beautiful
dark

a
giant

foamy

really
nice
the
smell
has
a
real
bisquity
aromaalmost
bakery
like
the
taste
has
a
subdued
hop
presence
along
with
some
sweet
malt
making
this
highly
drinkable
this
really
is
an
everyday
beer
that
i
would
have
if
i
lived
on
the
west
coast
excellant
job
north
coast
this
works
very
well
as
a
session
beer
as
it
is
not
too
strong
and
quaffable
but
with
enough
flavor
to
savor
crux
this
would
be
a
dbf
standard
if
i
could
get
it
where
i
live
recommended
red
ale
and
one
of
my
favorites
as
its
a
simple
way
hopped

ale
sessionable
indeed
note
found
a
dust
covered
6pack
in
a
local
store
once
was
so
glad
to
find
it
i

it
it
was
soso
this
beer
is
best
fresh
its
gotta
be
fresh
live
and
learn

that
stands

the
beers
has

perfume
with

thick

flavor
and
scent
is
also
present
the
beer
is

with
good
carbonation
this
beer
i
paired
with
different
cheeses
and
is
wonderful
with
each
one
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
and
a
regular
in
my
fridge
always
one
of
my
faves
for
the
warmer
months
i
actually
think
i
prefer
it
out
of
the
bottle
however
still
another
winner
from
north
coast
drinkability
red
seal
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
that
is
always
in
my
dbf
a
highly
drinkable
session
beer
that
is
well
balanced
and
with
a
5
5
abv
one
that
is
a
tailgating
favorite
during
football
season
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
turned
many
macro
drinkers
on
to
with
great
results
one
of
the
better
apas
out
there
and
one
that
i
highly
recommend
seek
and
enjoy
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malt
for
a
west
coast
apa
with
a
hop
kick
on
the
back
end
nice
dry
finish
extremely
drinkable
should
be
a
summertime
staple
beer
thats
always
in
the
fridge
i
love
this
beer
great
looking
a
deep
red
hue
that
is
a
bit
different
than
your
typical
pale
ale
some
red
ales
are
mild
this
one
is
not
nice
hit
of
bitterness
and
somewhat
tangy
taste
upfront
and
the
flavor
continues
until
the
end
of
the
glass
this
beer
has
good
body
as
well
but
itsnot
too
heavy
and
you
can
have
multiples
without
feeling
weighed
down
this
is
such
a
consistent
beer
great
for
warm
weather
when
you
want
something

little
more

apple

i
think
taste
is
toasted
malts
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
dose
of
hop
and
fruit
notes
mild
alcohol
bite
warms
the
palate
pleasant
then
finishes
fairly
clean
with
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
slick
due
to
the
medium
body
and
subtle
carbonation
this
beer
is
closer
to
the
english
style
pale
ale
rather
then
the
american
style
but
in
any
case
this
brew
is
top
notch
very
drinkable
i
could
kill
a
6er
of
this
on
a
friday
night
with
ease
great
beer
nothing
flashy
just
damn
good
an
interesting
brew
i
first
tasted
this
at
wild
wing
cafe
in
marietta
after
a
redhook
tasting
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
then
so
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
sixer
and
see
what
was
waiting
for
me
for
starters
the
beer
looks
good
slightly
cloudy
redorange
color
cuddly
offwhite
head
with
formidable
retention
and
pennypenched
lacing
an
herbalesque
nose
with
a
touch
of
coriander
orange
citrus
and
earthy
on
the
idea
of
peaty
maltiness
the
flavor
is
wonderfully
balanced
with
a
crisp
bite
and
quenching
burst
of
dryness
obvious
malt
and
trumpeting
hops
red
seal
has
a
linger
to
it
but
its
a
welcome
one
almost
a
smokeless
natural
tobacco
and
fruity
finish
this
beer
is
in
my
opinion
lightly
weighted
which
allows
for
easier
drinking
you
could
put
down
a
six
pack
of
this
with
ease
if
you
are
a
moderately
seasoned
beer
drinker
good
beer
period
moderate
mouth
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
while
the
nose
falls
abit
short
the
flavors
make
up
for
it
resulting
in
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
i
hope
this
one
hangs
around
for
a
while
in
my
area
this
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
every
time
i
drink
some
i
like
it
better
clearly
used
american
hops
which
i
like
good
to
feel
the
hops
taste
and
scent
overall
this
is
a
very
exceptional
little
ale
i
love
the
hop
flavor
and
balance
in
this
one
a
real
winner
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
overall
a
decent
beer
to
sample
i
think
theres
better
out
there
though
and
probably
would
not
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
a
delicious
ale
that
you
could
pound
going
from
the
gym
to
the
bar
and
ordering
this
i
easily
polished
it
off
under
2
minutes
the
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
spring
afternoon
beer
pours
with
one
fingered
head
atop
a
gorgeous
clear
red
body
not
a
ton
going
on
in
the
nose
of
this
one
some
slight
hop
aroma
and
and
a
touch
of
maltiness
can
be
detected
a
fairly
well
balanced
beer
with
a
good
blend
of
mild
hop
bittering
and
malt
undertones
not
overly
chewy
or
cloying
carbonation
is
perfect
in
the
mouth
and
it
finishes
as
strong
as
it
starts
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
red
seal
was
erecently
introduced
in
the
swedish
systembolagets
stores
considering
the
richness
of
american
beer
making
today
there
are
to
few
us
beer
available
here
so
this
is
a
welcome
addition
the
beer
smells
like
a
ale
should
and
has
a
nice
amber
color
the
first
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
followed
by
a
hoppy
bite
after
that
the
bitterness
dominates
it
is
perhaps
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
its
definately
a
well
crafted
and
well
balanced
beer
for
a
redamber
ale
it
is
not
so
hot
as
i
more
so
expect
a
less
hoppy
sweeter
malty
darker
pale
ale
from
the
bottlemore
akin
to
a
mild
brown
ales
even
but
i
dont
enjoy
most
pale
ales
so
i
was
a
little
disapointed
here
i
absolutely
prefer
this
to
most
if
not
all
straight
truly
pale
pale
ales
but
that
is
more
a
style
preference
if
this
is
instead
just
a
dark
pale
ale
well
okay
than
for
this
is
fairly
drinkable
within
that
style
as
an
amber
per
what
i
was
expecting
it
misses
the
mark
so
different
than
i
was
anticipating
by
itself
apart
from
all
stylistic
expectations
this
is
a
good
beer
granted
i
think
this
one
may
spoil
me
it
is
very
very
sessionable
and
one
i
think
ill
be
keeping
in
the
fridge
color
is
a
wheat
field
of
amber
but
what
really
seems
to
shine
is
the
head
well
maintained
and
very
solid
only
about
a
finger
and
a
half
worth
from
initial
pour
but
maintains
a
very
thick
foam
throughout
the
entire
beer
not
to
mention
some
very
consistent
lacing
smell
was
a
6040
balance
of
hops
and
dry
malts
the
hops
making
up
the
60
taste
was
just
the
same
a
little
more
hops
than
malt
in
the
balancing
act
not
bad
per
se
just
something
i
noticed
hints
of
seltzer
water
mixed
in
with
the
dry
malt
flavor
medium
boied
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
if
you
like
this
kind
of
hops
i
do
well
worth
a
try
this
is
a
solid
well
hopped
pale
ale
but
i
dont
really
like
it
it
has
a
solid
hop
kick
in
fact
more
so
than
most
of
the
style
but
i
dont
like
the
hops
used
and
the
malt
backround
does
not
balance
this
beer
well
at
all
tastes
like
the
finishing
hop
is
cascade
i
wish
i
knew
what
the
other
hops
used
were
this
has
notes
of
grapefruit
flowers
cellar
mustiness
tangy
and
spicy
hops
and
a
pretty
long
and
lingering
but
unpleasant
finish
also
for
being
5
5
the
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
ss
the
flavor
was
better
than
i
expected
nice
moderate
hop
character
with
a
malt
backbone
that
stood
up
to
give
it
a
balance
that
most
american
amber
ales
lack
nice
and
smooth
across
the
mouth
the
hop
flavor
expandes
across
the
tongue
and
deep
into
the
swallow
nice
finish
slightly
dry
but
not
so
much
as
to
leave
you
parched
easy
drinking
amber
ale
that
i
would
recommend
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
generously
carbonated
deep
redcopper
body
with
a
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
the
nose
was
citrusy
and
had
a
nice
caramely
base
to
it
the
malts
smelled
exceptional
you
get
more
delicious
malts
with
caramelly
tones
with
the
citrus
hops
there
but
not
in
the
way
to
make
this
beer
experience
too
dominated
by
either
the
hops
or
the
malt
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
another
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
great
beer
i
could
have
had
many
more
pints
of
red
seal
is
a
hazy
copper
with
plenty
of
carbonation
head
is
tall
creamy
and
tan
retention
is
very
good
aroma
is
of
a
enticing
citrissy
hop
atop
a
sweet
caramel
malt
citrissy
hop
is
the
first
flavor
noted
which
is
soon
taken
over
by
a
combination
biscuit
and
caramel
malts
finish
is
nutty
the
is
exactly
what
i
desire
in
an
amber
ale
full
flavors
that
are
nicely
layered
coupled
with
a
great
drinkability
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
such
a
straight
forward
pale
near
perfect
right
up
there
with
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
in
my
book
a
bit
milder
in
the
hop
profile
and
oh
so
complex
that
it
doesnt
ever
get
boring
got
a
growler
of
this
last
evening
more
or
less
just
got
it
on
a
whim
as
i
wanted
to
try
something
that
i
have
not
had
before
on
tap
luckily
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
least
the
color
of
the
beer
in
the
growler
was
a
amberorange
color
when
poured
from
the
growler
a
nice
head
was
formed
that
was
the
color
of
off
white
hedging
on
a
tan
color
had
a
good
retention
leaving
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nice
citrus
and
floral
hop
smell
definitely
can
pick
up
the
grapefruit
like
esters
also
has
a
nice
malt
scent
of
caramel
malt
that
is
noticeable
as
the
hop
scent
does
not
seem
to
be
overpowering
brew
has
a
very
smooth
taste
nice
amount
of
hop
flavoring
is
noticeable
and
does
leave
some
of
its
essence
on
your
tongue
while
the
hops
is
most
noticeable
they
dont
seem
to
dominate
as
i
am
able
to
clearly
pick
up
the
balancing
of
the
malts
that
lead
to
a
somewhat
caramel
flavor
over
all
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
one
that
i
cancould
drink
a
fair
amount
off
the
growler
was
gone
quite
quickly
will
look
for
this
one
again
in
the
future
poured
out
a
nice
dark
hazy
copperamber
with
a
12
inch
head
taken
to
the
nose
floweryfruity
hop
smells
also
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
an
exellent
blend
of
the
malt
and
strong
hops
starts
of
with
a
slighty
sweet
breadness
then
quickly
turns
to
citrus
bitter
mildly
herbal
and
a
floral
hops
punch
beautiful
west
coast
apa
a
superb
great
tasting
and
hoppy
beer
that
is
in
my
fridge
almost
all
the
time
i
appreciate
beers
like
this
one
sooo
much
this
is
my
penultimate
session
brew
damn
what
a
fine
job
the
brewers
at
north
coast
did
with
this
beer
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
i
am
not
a
hophead
but
this
beer
really
agrees
with
me
it
has
an
assertive
hop
bill
but
manages
to
have
enough
malt
to
give
it
a
run
for
its
money
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
in
the
future
guaranteed
the
mouthfeel
is
generously
carbonated
prickly
and
stingy
the
drinkability
is
good
also
this
might
have
a
shot
at
becoming
my
favorite
red
beer
definitly
worth
a
try
cheers
north
coast
is
such
a
hit
or
miss
brewery
however
i
know
alot
of
people
who
like
this
beer
so
what
can
i
say
different
strokes
another
winner
from
north
coast
flavor
starts
with
some
caramel
but
rolls
to
grassy
and
herbal
hops
quickly
the
beer
is
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
still
a
winner
in
my
book
pretty
much
a
solid
session
ale
nothing
too
good
or
too
bad
about
this
one
fairly
refreshing
could
make
a
good
crossoverbridge
beer
between
a
bmc
offering
and
a
nice
ipa
this
beer
came
in
a
stubby
twelve
ounce
bottle
it
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
it
has
a
citrusy
hoppy
smell
the
taste
is
pretty
fairly
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
it
has
somewhat
of
a
lighter
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
overall
id
say
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
recommended
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this
but
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
bright
orange
amber
with
a
light
white
smooth
head
smells
like
powdery
lagerlike
caramel
with
a
clover
floral
hops
the
flavor
begins
with
an
oatmeal
and
honey
malt
with
the
big
grassy
organic
floral
hops
accompanied
by
a
fine
electric
sourness
finishes
with
a
lagerlike
dry
pastiness
and
a
hint
of
pine
the
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
with
lots
of
small
bubble
carbonation
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
isnt
very
inspiring
a
red
ale
that
is
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
on
top
aroma
is
light
of
hops
and
malt
nothing
overwhelming
taste
is
the
same
malt
up
front
with
a
light
hop
feel
in
the
end
a
very
crisp
finish
in
the
end
nice
and
noticeable
balanced
is
a
way
to
describe
the
flavor
of
this
brew
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
and
very
easy
to
drink
little
weak
in
the
aroma
but
makes
up
in
flavor
sums
up
this
brew
drinkability

very
refreshing
not
overwhelming
hops
but
plenty
to
satisfy
a
bold
interpretation
of
the
style
try
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
no
freshness
dating
in
short
another
fine
north
coast
brew
with
alittle
something
for
everyone
an
interesting
interpretation
of
its
style
and
a
very
easydrinking
beer
with
a
respectable
amount
of
flavor
this
is
a
great
burger
beer
hell
give
me
some
grapes
and
cheddar
cheese
and
im
happy
this
beer
surprised
me
i
had
it
before
but
i
just
drank
it
without
thinking
about
but
i
put
my
beer
cap
on
it
tasted
much
better
i
love
when
beers
fool
me
like
this
im
happy
i
can
get
this
beer
in
council
bluffs
ia
i
will
get
more
it
is
a
good
drinker
try
one
pours
a
soft
brown
color
with
sublte
red
hues
a
strong
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
behind
aromas
of
yeast
and
different
types
of
sugar
seem
to
come
out
the
taste
is
as
would
be
expected
for
this
style
with
a
more
balanced
malt
hop
profiles
however
the
taste
does
not
linger
it
quickly
engulfs
the
tongue
and
is
gone
leaving
little
evidence
to
suggest
it
was
even
there
including
an
aftertaste
without
compelling
flavors
or
unique
characteristics
this
beer
isnt
something
i
would
want
on
a
regular
basis
but
in
a
single
sitting
i
could
have
more
than
one
all
and
all
a
good
drinkable
beer
medium
body
somewhat
chewy
crisp
hop
finish
lingering
bitterness
goes
down
easy
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
still
shows
off
some
malt
and
hops
nothing
spectacular
i
think
thisd
be
a
fine
choice
for
a
friend
who
hasnt
tried
much
besides
macros
session
starter
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
slightly
metallic
and
has
a
decent
bitterness
to
it
not
too
great
but
its
a
good
drinkable
ale
for
when
your
palate
doesnt
need
to
be
completely
bludgeoned
to
death
by
complexity
pretty
average
in
my
opinion
didnt
really
stand
out
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style

it
for

it

it

it

very

taste
and
a

reminds
me
more
of
an

than
an
amber
overall
a
beer
i
would
recommend
for
the
hopheads
out
there
was
ok
give
it
a
try
nice
brew
not
the
most
exciting
and
a
bit
too
earthy
got
my
liking
in
the
finish
but
the
malt
character
and
hop
profile
are
interesting
o
not
your
typical
christmas
beer
much
more
hop
forward
and
notably
bitter
but
it
is
pretty
darn
solid
tasted
very
watered
down
imo
didnt
really
care
fore
this
one
o
a
very
nice
amber
for
this
time
of
the
year
as
it
works
with
the
floral
hops
very
well
mostly
brings
to
mind
the
spruce
and
pine
notes
as
they
are
really
accented
by
the
hops
an
easy
and
mellow
drinker
for
the
winter
season
for
sure
o
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
initial
flavor
but
it
drank
pretty
easily
the
bitter
was
a
bit
too
strong
of
a
finish
for
me
yet
none
of
these
would
dissuade
me
from
having
this
again
after
reading
this
im
not
sure
why
i
liked
it
surprising
stratification
among
the
reviews
im
in
chicago
maybe
we
got
a
bad
shipment
as
a
christmas
ale
it
lacks
the
christmas
flavors
i
would
expect
better
from
rogue
as
long
as
you
close
your
eyes
and
just
want
to
go
for
a
plain
ol
beer
this
stuff
is
nirvana
but
if
you
like
your
beers
a
little
unhinged
and
are
expecting
anything
unique
walloping
or
robust
you
might
be
a
bit
let
down
this
is
the
only
bomber
ive
had
no
problem
downing
all
by
myself
as
its
that
outlandishly
appealing
and
drinkable
overall
a
well
made
and
quite
drinkable
red
ale
do
not
let
this
beer
fool
you
into
thinking
it
is
a
christmas
or
winter
spiced
beer
didnt
taste
like
a
christmas
beer
but
it
was
good
didnt
care
for
the
taste
tasted
flat
and
dull
not
very
good
not
bad
not
a
favorite
im
sorry
but
this
beer
offered
nothing
to
the
christmas
dinner
it
was
brought
to
it
was
watery
and
lacking
in
flavor
it
had
very
little
smell
it
did
not
compliment
the
food
i
was
eating
in
any
way
it
was
not
refreshing
or
warming
or
palate
cleansing
or
anything
i
would
want
out
of
a
simple
holiday
dinner
beer
if
you
are
going
to
put
santa
in
your
title
at
least
give
me
a
little
spice
it
was
as
the
65
ibus
suggest
somewhat
bitter
but
i
like
my
bitter
with
some
flavor
before
it
perhaps
i
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
this
with
dinner
perhaps
on
its
own
it
is
better
than
my
review
suggests
perhaps
i
am
not
refined
enough
to
discern
the
flavor
of
free
range
coastal
water
perhaps
no
definitely
compared
to
the
other
beers
i
have
had
in
the
past
few
days
it
just
did
not
rate
overall
a
nice
hopped
up
red
from
rogue
this
one
is
just
an
all
around
good
drinking
red
nice
way
to
close
out
christmas
day
with
it
snowing
outside
tastes
exactly
as
the
bottle
describes
copper
color
roasty
malt
flavor
with
hoppy
sprucey
finish
very
solid
o
not
sure
this
screams

to
me
those

highlights
of
this

what

aspects
that
i

i

when
its

what

it
was
good

not
quite
as

was

its
the

push
this
above

about

lingering

quite
a

the
flavor
and
aroma
begin
to
grow
on
me
i
was
expecting
some
more
flavor
from
the
malt
and
was
absolutely
shocked
after
searching
high
and
low
for
this
one
and
continually
coming
up
disappointed
although
this
brew
is
considered
a
winter
selection

struck
me
a
beer
so
unpleasant
an
inch
of

bubbled
foam
that
dissipates
to
a
nicely
retained
layer
subastantial
ring
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
bready
malt
with

hops
taste
is
dry
so
im
trying
to
review
the
beer
aside
from
my
personal
preference
the
color
was
obviously
amber
with
red
undertones

was
expecting
a
very
strong
bitter
winter
ale
orange
and
lemon
peel
surprise
i
was
not
disappointed
there
is
a
great
hops
taste
that
hinted
of
grapefruit
and
walnut
very
pleasant
to
the
taste
buds
but
with
a
little
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
perhaps
the
roguish
side
of
old
kris
kringle
the
aftertaste
offered
a
sprucelike
recognition
that
was
risky
for
rogue
its
something
i
could
have
most
of
the
rest
of
the

only
downfall
in
my
opinion
is
that
both
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
werent
great
it
gives
you
a
bit
of
a
kick
but
not
in
a
good
way
when
you
have
it
swirling
around
in
your
mouth
it
also

another
awesome
brew
in

quiet

non

less
now
after
enjoying
the
2007
vintage
in

2007
now
available
in
6
packs
yeah
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
winter
beers
being
exceedingly
drinkable
nice
bright
nw
hops
and
a
wintery
mixture
of
sweet
amber
malts
makes
it

for
a
winters

kind
what
drinking
pinesol
might
be
like
without
the
death
hops
on
finish
ok
flavor
but
strange
and
a
bit
harch
not
my
favorite
from
rogue
eacy
to
drink
though
santas
probably
doing
ok
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
seems
very
rounded
and
balanced
flavor
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
just
more
potent
than
the
others
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
light
brown
foamy
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
spices
is
quite
dominant
with
a
nice
touch
of
sweet
malt
taste
of
spruce
and
pine
is
quite
dominant
with
some
liquorice
hops
seems
to
be
a
bit
subdued
and
body
is
a
bit
thinner
then
expected
interesting
beer
but
not
necessarily
something
that
i
would
seek
out
often
full
bodied
and
delectable
feel
in
the
mouth
this
stuff
is
highly
drinkable
but
very
fillng
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
makes
this
beer
seem
and
taste
healthy
a
good
winter
beer
indeed
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
red
with
small
fluffy
white
head
leaving
a
nice
lacing
behind
nose
is
mostly
made
up
of
piney
resiny
hops
with
a
hint
of
a
maltiness
to
it
taste
does
have
some
caramel
malt
taste
to
it
but
the
hops
are
prevalent
in
the
taste
not
used
to
such
hoppiness
in
this
style
but
its
not
bad
medium
bodied
with
less
than
average
carbonation
not
my
favorite
at
this
point
but
will
look
forward
to
it
next
year
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
aggressive
for
my
taste
i
am
starting
to
think
that
it
is
the
water
at
rogue
that
i
dont
care
for
their
dark
ales
are
awesome
but
i
dont
think
that
i
really
care
for
their
lighter
beers
much
unless
they
are
really
big
this
one
is
destined
to
be
bitter
though
with
44ibus
only
13
plato
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
like
i
do
their
chocolate
and
imperial
stouts
felt
relatively
good
took
some
time
with
this
one
but
overall
id
say
it
was
pretty
drinkable
all
things
considered
i
was
a
bit
mislead
by
the
name
and
bottle
drinkability
unfortunately
this
is
a
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
bad
because
it
packs
a
little
more
punch
than
a
standard
beer
making
it
a
little
much
to
session
with
but
that
is
perfectly
ok
purchased
at
the
still
for

i
may
try
to

up
another
before
they
are
gone
definitely
a
beer
that
i
will
look
forward
to
getting
again
next
year
pours
a
regular
head
that
falls
away
into
a
weak
lacing
with
a
little
foam
looks
red
to
light
brown
in
color
and
its
fairly
clear
the
first
scent
is
of
sharp
piney
hops
with
a
little
fruity
sweetness
for
an
undertone
bitter
piney
hops
hits
my
mouth
and
throat
attacking
it
almost
making
me
choke
once
i
got
used
to
it
and
let
it
warm
up
it
gets
better
and
in
the
end
leaves
a
slight
sweet
fruity
taste
on
the
palate
from
the
bottle
poured
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
hops
hops
hops
do
i
need
to
say
it
again
spicey
malts
citrus
flavor
hops
gotta
love
that
free
range
coastal
water
yeast
this
sure
took
care
of
my
hops
craving
i
was
having
at
the
time
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
quite
dark
and
rich
appearance
hops
are
the
next
thing
you
notice
here
perceived
bitterness
is
high
here
because
of
the
high
alpha
hops
used
floral
aroma
is
striking
and
very
spicy
flavor
is
hops
dominated
not
well
balanced
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
amber
ale
i
cant
see
drinking
this
beer
any
other
time
than
the
week
proceeding
christmas
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
full
this
ale
has
nice
copper
color
half
inch
head
with
medium
lacing
between
sips
the
predominant
taste
is
hoppiness
with
overpowering
bitterness
during
the
taste
i
noted
slight
honey
smelltaste
overtone
that
fell
short
from
hop
predominance
some
malt
that
again
is
over
powered
by
bitterness
expected
more
yule
flavors
of
spice
and
so
this
one
falls
short
of
holiday
fare
for
the
time
of
year
hop
heads
will
love
it
the
mouth
feel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
tasty
and
complex
well
balanced
with
a
nice
fruitiness
well
done
i
look
forward
to
next
years
release
its
nice
that
this
beer
does
not
go
nuts
with
winter
spices
but
instead
develops
a
nice
fruithopmalt
balance
well
done
rogue
overall
quite
drinkable
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
beer
so
honeytasting
its
slick
and
sweet
but
pleasantly
balanced
i
can
and
will
have
another
thanks
very
nice
deep
reddish
amber
color
very
light
on
the
carbonation
aroma
is
sweet
and
floral
with
a
hint
of
citris
taste
is
a
typical
ipa
at
first
very
nice
hops
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
the
hops
on
the
back
end
are
distictive
and
have
a
nice
bitterness
that
lingers
a
good
long
while
overall
a
great
christmas
brew
looked
good
felt
good
and
went
down
good
the
color
was
a
nice
red
lots
of
head
and
lace
with
head
lasting
a
good
while
the
smell
was
bitter
hops
and
a
touch
of
metalic
sweetness
with
some
overtones
of
yeast
bready
but
not
in
the
good
way
i
cant
quite
explain
but
not
inviting
to
me
at
least
the
taste
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
from
a
rogue
red
ale
nice
big
c
hop
bittering
this
bad
boy
with
other
hops
give
a
mild
spicy
taste
but
a
little
thin
on
the
malt
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
too
great
go
santa
go
bitter
mouthfeel
no
body
not
good
tempted
to
dump
it
down
the
drain
but
the
usc
texas
game
is
upcoming
so
i
will
painfully
finish
this
one
cheers
beertracker
the
taste
does
have
a
sweet
malty
note
up
front
but
theres
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
that
is
making
for
a
nicely
balanced
brew
and
then
the
bitterness
takes
over
in
the
aftertaste
and
adds
to
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
amber
its
a
good
drop
worth
buying
again
im
partial
to
these
special
holiday
brews
when
theyve
got
something
extram
this
ones
not
a
bad
choice
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
was
happy
pours
a
clean
reddish
brown
hue
makes
a
bone
white
head
some
light
lacing
on
my
glass
as
it
empties
theres
a
rich
caramel
malt
aroma
that
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
piney
centennial
hops
flavor
begins
with
a
moderate
amount
of
distinct
chinook
bitterness
followed
by
a
nice
clean
caramel
and
barley
malt
profile
piney
and
floral
hop
flavors
mingle
with
a
subtle
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
caramel
malt
really
dominates
the
flavor
overall
medium
bodied
soft
creamy
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
sweet
coating
on
the
throat
nice
seasonal
here
from
rogue
it
offers
up
good
balance
which
makes
this
one
really
easy
to
drink
ill
definitely
give
it
another
go
next
winter

head
with

retention
santas
nose
is
a
complex
blend
of
malty

slightly
roasted
with
a
great
nutty
finish
hints
of
warm
pine
and
spruce
are
evident
as
well
this
is
a
delicious
ale
beautifully
balanced
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
trace
of
honey
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
oily
and
creamy
just
right
for
the
various
taste
elements
interwoven
within
this
impressive
offering
although
somewhat
full
bodied
the
medium
weight
of
this
brew
and
the
generally
lean
composition
make
for
spirited
and
effortless
consumption
with
fresh
hops
never
tiring
the
palate
the
choice
of
hops
used
within
should
be
applauded
for
never
allowing
this
brew
to
go
extreme
in
any
way
very
well
planed
and
executed
this
is
a
truly
fantastic
ale
may
this
winter
season
begin
a
rather
nice
offering
from
rogue
but
not
as
outstanding
as
some
of
their
other
brews
this
beer
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
it
is
low
in
alcohol
so
putting
a
few
down
would
not
be
a
problem
also
the
flavor
is
not
overly
aggressive
i
would
probably
recomend
this
beer
ahh
very
nice
a
christmas
ale
with
some
hops
starts
with
a
malty
nutty
flavor
then
hops
close
out
the
finish
pretty
tasty
a
nice
change
although
not
quite
as
adventerous
as
the
other
seasonals
ive
been
trying
this
winter
ale
has
a
dark
brown
appearance
and
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
a
pleseant
toasted
nut
the
taste
has
a
big
nut
flavor
upfront
that
becomes
slightly
hoppy
the
flavor
moves
into
a
spice
on
the
back
end
the
body
is
medium
for
a
winter
brew
the
thirst
for
another
is
not
too
great
overall
i
like
to
have
one
of
these
every
season
for
a
nice
switch
the
taste
is
very
earthy
as
well
with
nice
malted
hops
and
a
delicate
blend
of
holiday
spice
there
is
an
aftertaste
but
it
is
pleasant
to
have
it
was
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
of
my
gifts
sampled
in
front
of
the
christmas
treepours
a
deep
burnt
copper
color
topped
with
a
dense
white
head
the
head
leaves
thick
tufts
of
intricate
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
flowery
and
piney
hop
smells
are
at
the
center
of
this
brew
theres
a
lot
of
competing
hop
smells
in
this
one
backed
with
a
grain
and
toasted
malt
its
not
quite
a
hop
monster
but
with
a
little
more
intensity
it
would
subscribe
to
that
description
the
taste
is
balanced
and
semisweet
malt
and
grain
come
out
a
little
more
in
the
mouth
with
a
earthy
character
hops
still
dominate
though
with
a
moderately
long
finish
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
was
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
drinkability
a
litle
to
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
but
definetly
worth
downing
a
couple
of
bombers
one
long
xmas
eve
or
day
d
its
good
but
not
for
the
newbie
drinkability
this
is
not
really
a
sitbackandrelax
beer
which
is
what
i
wanted
on
this
christmas
eve
but
it
is
delicious
nonetheless
tasty
effort
reminds
me
of
buffed
up
brutal
bitter
all
in
all
quite
drinkable
id
compare
this
to
stones
bastard
though
a
bit
lighter
or
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
but
without
the
rye
its
quite
close
to
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
lagunitas
imperial
red
all
of
these
are
excellent
excellen
brews
and
rogues
santas
private
reserve
is
of
similar
quality
ill
finish
this
bomber
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
i
am
normally
a
fan
of
rogue
but
this
beer
was
a
big
disappointment
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
that
is
almost
brown
there
is
a
sizeable
head
that
laces
and
holds
well
it
smells
nicely
of
some
hop
bitterness
and
roasted
malts
it
also
tastes
in
this
way
with
the
exception
that
there
is
a
definite
presence
of
some
spices
it
feels
thick
in
your
mouth
and
there
is
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
great
drink
to
pair
with
a
holiday
meal

gimme
some
more
thats
some
mighty
fine
beer

a
good
beer
but
this
one
is
real
nice
sweet
smooth
and
musky
up

with
a
hint
of
some
spiced

the

another
solid

definately
a
step
up
from
st
rogue
red
i
have
to
say
i
liked
this
one
better
fresh
than
with
a
couple
months
on
it

lots

nice

and
an
interesting
seasonal
try
it
for
something
different
than
your
typical
winter
warmer
this
season
body
is
just
above
light
and
definately
needs
some
beefing
up
not
watery

not
big

the

over

taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
the
great
piney
rogue
hops
hitting
first
but
giving
way
quickly
to
a
rich
biscuity
malt
slightly
buttery
riding
into
the
end
where
it
gets
overtaken
by
those
hops
for
a
nice
bitter
finish
well
balanced
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
really
an
excellent
amber
ale
rivalling
the
best
ive
tasted
in
brs
red
rocket
and
unlike
the
festiveale
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
seasonal
before
the
holidays
are
over
nice
drinkable
winter
beer
when
you
dont
want
to
go
too
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
overall
a
solid
brew
with
the
double
hop
and
malt
flavor
shining
nice
for
the
winter
time
but
tastes
like
it
could
be
a
yearround
offering
stays
right
in
line
with
classic
rogue
flavors
and
taste
solid
overall
a
classic
red
ale
rather
hoppy
my
wife
actually
thought
it
was
an
ipa
at
first
but
the
malt
character
and
color
scream
red
ale
one
of
the
best
reds
ive
had
in
a
while
very
agreeable
jolly
perhaps
good
stuff
from
rogue
glad
i
picked
it
up
great
all
around
another
good
rogue
santa
should
drop
a
keg
of
this
under
everyones
tree
im
drinking
this
with
some
home
made
vegi
curry
i
added
a
hotdog
too
i
dont
know
what
i
was
thinking
but
it
is
not
that
bad
the
brew
and
the
hotdog
along
with
the
creamy
curry
goes
very
well
id
recommend
it
in
the
future

mixed

some

sugar
and
vanilla
finished
with
a
great
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
rich
full
bodied
and
well
balanced
another
great
beer
from
rogue
overall
another
awesome
beer
from
the
masters
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
something
about
their
beers
totally
coincides
with
my
taste
buds
rogue
is
the
best
craft
brewer
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
best
appearing
red
ales
i
have
had
it
has
the
color
of
a
glass
of
red
wine
it
poured
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
containshmmm
is
that
cinnamon
that
taste
is
a
little
bitter
more
so
than
than
is
typical
for
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
bitter
finish
i
could
drink
these
often
it
is
a
very
good
red
beer
that
is
a
good
choice
for
fans
of
the
style
very
red
almost
cherry
red
with
little
head
the
colors
very
appropriate
for
the
season
smells
of
floral
hops
with
nectarine
cherries
cranberries
and
a
slight
molasses
malt
for
the
taste
sweet
and
sour
hops
come
first
then
a
doughy
malt
flavor
appears
when
held
in
the
mouth
with
a
fluffy
carbonation
then
it
finishes
dry
and
almost
piney
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
it
works
well
with
the
flavor
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
thats
fun
to
drink
but
i
kept
thinking
of
ginger
snaps
and
sugar
cookies
while
i
was
drinking
it
i
dont
know
if
i
was
biased
by
the
name
or
if
rogue
really
made
an
amazing
beer
either
way
ill
try
it
with
the
cookies
next
time
again
another
fantastic
offering
form
the
west
coast
oelergud
notes
most
rogue
offerings
have
a
permanent
place
in
my
beer
stable
but
for
the
price
this
is
just
decent
and
i
use
the
word
decent
in
context
with
rogue
for
most
other
breweries
this
beer
would
be
upper
tier
but
this
is
average
for
these
fellas
the
bottle
lays
claim
to
a
roasty
malt
flavor
but
the
overarching
character
of
this
beer
would
be
better
described
as
butterscotch
or
toffee
that
is
to
say
and
snowflakes
glisten
written
on
the
side
the
head
in
the
guise
and
with
the
price
of
an
exciting
seasonal
release

as
usual
nutmeg
with
an
average
sized
yellowish
white
head
that
remained
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
was
like
most
rogue
beers
not
much
malt
to
balance
it
out
a
little
thin
on
the
pallete
it
did
get
better
as
it
warmed
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
maybe
i
just
havent
had

awhile

i
was

the


i
first

this

thought
it
would
be

to
take
another
look
at
it
with
an

its
a
bit
bigger
and
maltier
then
i
remember
it
but
it
wasnt
so
i
went
on
the
site
to
see
that
it
was
an

a

with
a
healthy

aroma
is
very
hoppy
and
just
a
bit

taste
is
way
hugely
hoppy
and
bitter
just
the
way
i
like
it
the
balance
it
just
seemed
out
of
balance

thick

character
in

leafy

earthy
hops
are
noticeable
at
first
rushing
in
with
the
big
malt
character
which
is
sweet
a

roasted
and
slightly
bready
combining
well
with
those
hops
rindlike
bitterness
follows
closely
behind
pine
and
citrus
are
also
present
but
subtlely
crisp
and
sweet
at
the

crisp
in

this

i
should
have
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
im
quite
impressed
i
love
it
extremely
tasty
in
that
earthy
way
not
your
typical
winter
beer
but
it
does
warm
you
and
the
hops
provide
spiciness
where
spices
would
be
in
other
winter
beers
id
really
love
to
have
this
beer
available
to
me
yearround
i
might
just
stock
up
so
i
can
keep
it
around
for
a
while
another

musttry
this
beer
is
from
a
most
impressive

the

has
no

it
is
painted

this
beer
pour
a
dark
red
with
about
2
fingers

the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
the
dominate
taste
is

it
finishes

this
is
a

seems
more
like
an

than
a
traditional
red
ale
due
to
the
intense
amount
of
hops
in
this
one
a
tasty
winter
seasonal
offering
for
those
who
like
intensely

beers
i
wouldnt

stocking
up
on

in

it

someone

with

flower
wait
this
is
no
dream
its
santas
private

i
expected
an
attempt
at
a
malt
balance
to
this
serious
hophead
beer
but
found
none
my
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
long
in
the
tooth
i
will
try
to
find
this
fresh
at
the
end
of
the
year
deep
ruby
red
with
nice
off
white
head
that
left
great
lacing
this
ale
is
the
ipa
of
holiday
beers
at
least
to
me
very
hoppy
and
bitter
finish
still
was
pretty
smooth
abv
is
on
the
high
side
so
this
is
one
to
savour
and
sip
slowly
went
well
with
ham
potatoes
green
salad
the
fireplace
and
suzanne
p
s
she
was
having
fosters
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
and
i
think
its
going
to
quickly
find
its
way
onto
my
favorites
list
too
bad
its
only
a
seasonal
time
to
go
back
to
the
store
to
stock
up
golden
amber
with
a
thin
but
lacy
head
aroma
is
a
beautiful
combination
of
spice
grapefruit
and
pine
with
a
touch
of
breadlike
malt
flavor
is
straight
on
with
the
nose
some
sweetness
balances
the
hop
bitterness
but
there
is
an
ample
amount
of
bitterness
also
some
pine
and
citrus
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
this
is
quite
unique
and
since
its
brewed
as
a
winter
warmer
i
cant
really
dock
it
for
not
being
like
other
amber
ales
very
good
stuff
the
first
rogue
brew
that
i
have
tried
santas
private
reserve
is
a
very
red
ale
and
extremly
hoppy
not
that
that
is
a
bad
thing
if
your
into
hops
this
is
a
good
choice
for
a
winter
beer
if
your
idea
of
a
winter
beer
icludles
a
lot
of
spicy
flavor
try
something
else
probably
the
most
aggressive
red
ale
ive
tried
santas
private
reserve
is
a
typical
rogue
brew
big
on
hops
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
with
a
variety
of
malts
backing
them
up
along
the
way
the
finish
is
dry
and
quite
bitter
making
for
a
nice
changeup
on
the
traditional
amberred
ale
style
looks
great
in
the
glass
with
a
wellretaining
head
too
a
delightful
wintertime
brew
if
youre
into
hops
if
not
id
suggest
you
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
personally
ill
imbibe
again
not
much
else
to
peg
on
this
one
except
to
say
im
glad
i
didnt
have
to
classify
this
beer
i
would
have
been
trying
to
get
all
fancy
with
it
but
sure
enough
its
just
a
wackedoutwithhops
red
ale
the
beer
pours
a
deep
burnished
copper
color
the
head
is
gargantuan
in
size
frothy
in
texture
the
lace
in
thick
sticky
sheets
to
smother
the
glass
and
both
a
light
tan
color
nose
is
citrus
hop
floral
malt
under
tones
and
quite
a
sniffer
front
is
sweet
malt
the
top
slender
the
finish
is
strikingly
hop
spicy
pleasantly
acidic
droughty
aftertaste
good
drinkable
beer
for
the
hop
heads
in
the
audience
and
well
worth
a
sample
ranks
361
on
my
current
1000
beer
master
list
deep
dark
rich
amber
color
very
smooth
tasting
beer
for
an
holiday
ale
full
flavored
yet
doesnt
knock
you
on
your
arse
like
most
of
the
holiday
ales
tend
to
do
sweet
aroma
on
thge
nose
this
would
be
best
described
as
a
lite
beer
in
the
holiday
ale
genre
a
good
one
to
start
with
but
i
need
something
a
bit
stronger
for
a
holiday
ale
great
looking
beer
mahagony
in
color
with
a
creamy
lace
on
top
not
as
much
on
the
nose
as
i
anticipated
with
this
hopped
up
red
ale
definitely
some
grapefruit
notes
on
the
nose
but
not
real
heavy
hops
overwhelm
the
taste
the
chinooks
really
shine
through
this
could
be
an
incredible
beer
with
a
better
malt
load
and
roastiness
its
just
too
unbalanced
for
me
to
rate
it
as
a
spectacular
beer
the
hops
are
wonderfull
now
wheres
the
rest
ill
definitely
drink
one
of
these
each
holiday
season
but
its
not
one
ill
seek
out
for
more
a
good
hoppy
red
ale
but
not
all
that
special
for
a
holiday
brew
especially
coming
from
rogue
very
impressive
deep
rudolph
red
color
with
a
frothy
head
a
sweet
and
hoppy
bouquet
greets
you
as
you
settledown
with
this
beauty
the
flavor
has
the
dryness
of
a
red
ale
with
nice
caramel
flavor
and
pleasant
hop
finish
this
is
my
favorite
winter
english
strong
ale
and
will
look
forward
to
having
many
more
pours
a
clear
very
reddishcopper
color
with
a
full
foamy
light
tan
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
hoppy
pineygently
citrusy
and
lightly
fruity
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
softly
fruity
and
lightly
nutty
a
nicely
sweet
caramel
maltiness
comes
through
before
becoming
engulfed
in
resiny
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
and
yet
the
bitterness
never
really
builds
on
the
palate
extremely
well
balanced
for
such
a
boldly
hopped
beer
it

dry

this
beer
reminded
me
of

with

interesting
a
solid

diminished
malt
tinged
with
maple
but
backed
by
good
body
runs
handinhand
with
a
decided
hop
backbone
like
a
fight
between
small
but
aggressive
hops
and
big
and
lazy
malt
both
are
there
throughout
the
sip
i
liked
the
approach
to
balance
and
throw
another
thumbs
up
to
rogue
and
their
good
to
excellent
products
i
think
the
folks
at
rogue
really
articulate
how
important
it
is
for
them
to
use
quality
ingredients
and
to
make
consistently

just
did

the

taste
was
exceptional
maybe
my

was
old
but
i
dont

so
i
love
how
the

peaks
through
for
just
a

comments
this
is
an
excellent
red
ale
that
could
be
argued
as
a
red
ipa
as
the
hop
character
is
huge
reddish
amber
in

a
millimeter
thick
bit
of
foam
rests
on

brussels
lacing
on
the

aroma
is
of
amber
malt
and
i
get
a
good
dose
of
the
pine
like
hops
good
balance
of
bitterness
with
the
pine
like
hops
and
the
amber
malt
the
hops
tend
to
dominate
mouth
is
prickling
my
tongue
with
the
bitterness
flavorful
red
ale
very
sessionable
and
more
assertive
than
complex
it
would
be
much
nicer
if
they
beef
up
both
malt
and
hops
d
5
1
could
have
more
than
one
but
i
find
the
citrus
flavors
too
intense
and
too
candy
like
even
with
the
bitter
finish
otherwise
tho
completely
different
its
with
nugget
nectar
as
a
solid
red
ale
that
you
really
must
try
original
and
intense

for
everyone

by
some

and

spicy
and
floral
hops
towards
the

with

with

its

to
me
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
i
was
expecting
more
hop
flavor
out
of
this
one
but
its
still
a
decent
red
ale
overall
id
grab
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
the
deepest
funkiest
dankest
hop
stew
im
not
entirely
sure
what
the
point
is
of
brewing
a
beer
like
this
but
its
quite
distinctive
and
i
dont
mean
that
as
a
compliment
cardboard
and

quite
bitter
and
herbal
at
the

no
sediment
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at

in
san
diego
o
great
drinkability
rogue
quality
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
malty
goodness
at
the
start
and
a
definite
licorice
quality
to
it
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
briefly
aqualung
overall
just
a
bit
outofbalance
to
me
the
hoppy
reads
i
have
enjoyed
have
been
included
a
lot
more
red
malt
flavor
wont
buy
again
any
time
soon
but
glad
i
got
to
taste
it
rogue
just
has
potential
to
do
it
better
than
this
o
very
good
hoppy
red
ale
you
could
pound
a
few
of
these
with
the
mild
abv
pleasant
enough
for
a
hop
head
but
not
overly
agressive
overall
cant
find
a
date
on
the
bottle
but
im
sure
this
beer
is
really
good
when
fresh
it
has
a
nice
flavour
but
it
doesnt
have
much
hop
vibrancy
still
a
good
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
hopefully
with
a
date
on
the
bottle

has

lingering
flavor
overall
a
very
good
flavorful
and
pleasant
brew
overall
a
great
pint
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
maybe
its
the
yeast
with
each
drink
the
smell
of
honey
took
over
the
taste
but
subsided
once
the
bitter
settled
in
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
its
an
interesting
brew
and
worth
a
try
not
one
of
the
best
of
rogues
lineup
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
i
feel
this
is
superseded
even
by
local
takes
on
the
style
wayward
riverside
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
it
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
the
dark
malt
notes
pop
up
from
time
to
time
to
clash
with
the
big
breadiness
that
dominates
the
flavor
the
hop
character
is
piny
and
bitter
and
doesnt
seem
to
mesh
with
the
awkward
malt
character
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
ill
say
its
muddled
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
an
amber
ale
ill
seek
something
a
little
more
finetuned
overall
i
am
not
going
to
get
it
again
but
its
not
as
bad
as
others
say
overall
maybe
i
purchased
a
badoldlight
struck
bottle
therefore
i
may
give
it
a
second
chance
one
day
nevertheless
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
hoppier
red
ale
with
a
fat
malt
backbone
to
make
for
some
delicious
sipping
overall
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
an
old
bottle
it
was
in
a
pick
6
and
the
store
is
always
rotating
stock
and
keeps
fresh
beer
not
too
many
old
beers
in
there
but
this
very
well
could
have
been
i
may
try
another
at
a
different
store
low
on
alcohol
but
still
a
good
ale
i
like
it
a
less
aggressive
5am
saint
centennial
shows
up
big
and
there
might
be
a
big
of
chocolate
malt
in
there
but
no
dry
hopping
except
for
a
slight
grassiness
not
approaching
red
rocket
or
cascazilla
but
a
solid
amber
o
very
hoppy
and
flavorful
for
both
the
style
and
the
limited
abv
a
bit
rugged
improved
with
some
warming
yes
this
was
a
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
have
another
of
these
if
it
was
the
only
beer
left
in
my
fridge
i
had
a
bad
feeling
about
this
when
it
bubbled
over
upon
opening
and
like
a
few
others
on
here
i
didnt
taste
the
dry
hopping
on
here
if
this
was
made
another
way
in
the
past
id
give
that
a
go
since
somethings
not
lining
up
right
at
all
with
this
beer
o
pretty
good
but
not
great
the
flavor
was
lacking
in
strong
malt
characteristics
final
thoughts
if
you
like
red
ales
then
this
would
be
a
good
choice
because
it
has
a
sufficient
amount
of
flavor
and
is
sessionable
at
5
10
abv
definitely
not
among
the
best
but
a
pretty
good
brew
none
the
less
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
especially
to
a
person
such
as
myself
just
now
exploring
craft
beer
id
drink
this
beer
again
although
for
the
price
id
much
prefer
other
beers
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
throughout
the
whole
drink
hops
appear
to
be
of
the
floral
variety
as
i
only
get
a
mild
floral
character
on
the
nose
similarly
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
a
certain
bitterness
that
isnt
made
up
for
with
the
flavor
not
much
carbonation
or
anything
to
spruce
it
up
at
all
just
a
very
plain
beer
rogue
has
another
red
which
is
much
better
than
this
overall
an
interesting
but
not
elite
red
if
memory
serves
correct
and
i
believe
it
does
i
liked
this
beer
better
when
it
wasnt
dryhopped
as
it
is
now
i
wish
theyd
release
that
version
again
taste
is
mild
with
a
slight
citrus
hops
touch
but
this
is
backed
up
by
a
substantial
malt
profile
not
bad
not
great
but
just
a
fine
and
drinkable
session
ale
o
nice
and
smooth
easy
to
have
quite
a

this

was

again

i
like

for

more
of

im

not

however
nothing
special
i
liked
the
toasted
sweetness
of
the
beer
but
not
the
over
abundance
of

in

initial
taste
would
recommend
to
friends
and
buy
again
o
not

favorite
from

i
would

buy
it
if
so
highly
reccomended
for
a
dry

pale
would
buy
again
another
good
offering
from
rogue
that
does
not
quite
match
their
american
amber
ale
the
ale
could
use

but
it
is
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
light
and
almost
watery
with
light
carbonation
a
light
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
while
i
would
drink
it
again
i
would
not
seek
it
out
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
the
combination
of
slight
bitterness
and
sweetness
were
balanced
and
was
very
refreshing
i
need
to
try
more
dry

beers
and
i
look

to
trying
this
one
again
very
straightforward
and

rogue
i
must
say
not
as
much
hop
aroma
as
i
expected
a
decent
amount
of
pine

taste
was
refreshingly

poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
auburnbrown
coloring
with
a
thin
big
bubbled
frothy
yellowtan
colored
head
that
clings
scantily
all
over
the
glass
tangy
sweet
and
slightly
sour
malt
aromas
with
a
peppery
hops
blend
flavor
blasts
hop
forward
with
the
taste
at
the
tip
and
sides
of
the
tongue
the
tangy
and
slightly
roasted
caramel
sweetness
fills
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
the
roof
of
the
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
light
with
a
slight
cloying
feel
and
a
resiny
kick
of
the
hops
the
finish
is
slick
but
cleans
up
quickly
decent
brew
and
very
easy
to
drink
aroma
is
straight
fresh
soft
citric
hops
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
smelling
of
mild
yet
sweet
caramel
malts
i
like
the
balance
here
hoppy
yet
the
malt
bill
is
prevelant
balance
is
evident
on
the
tongue
as
well
sweet
malts
mixed
citric
make
this
red
ale
a
standout
for
its
style
although
the
extreme
hop
usage
may
deviate
from
the
traditional
sense
right
up
there
with
ccb
tocobaga
in
my
opinion
o
love
this
beer
it
was
a
little
over
the
top
with
the
hops
but
that
it
is
how
i
like
it
nice
little
12oz
a
pleasant
sweet
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
hops
appearance
is
amber
with
light
white
head
taste
is
bitter
malty
and
slightly
yeasty
pallet
is
slick
and
bitter
with
a
sharp
carbonation
another
solid
addition
to
rogues
lineup
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
o
a
above
average
amber
ale
good
hop
profile
throughout
very
earthy
would
have
expected
more
malt
character
certainly
worth
a
shot
this
poured
out
as
a
reddish
brown
colored
brew
with
a
yellowish
off
white
head
on
top
the
beer
has
good
clarity
to
it
the
lacing
is
thin
but
does
stick
around
for
just
a
little
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
sweet
malts
mixed
in
with
a
really
nice
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
pretty
strong
bitterness
to
it
with
some
sweetness
in
the
back
end
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
average
really
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
this
brew
isnt
too
bad
its
enjoyable
but
i
never
went
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
either
o
okay
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
was
a
good
beer
by
no
means
great
but
just
a
better
than
average
good
beer
honestly
i
expected
more
from
this
red
ale
this
continued
as
i
scoped
the
color
and
look
of
this
red
rogue
usually
always
hits
the
mark
for
me
but
this
one
just
didnt
get
all
the
way
there
came
up
a
bit
short
however
that
being
said
its
still
a
pretty
good
brew
some
unique
flavors
ive
never
experienced
and
that
alone
makes
it
worth
a
try
im
sure
ill
buy
another
at
some
point
in
time
especially
if
i
can
get
it
as
a
single
bottle
like
this
time
its
a
remarkably
gorgeous
looking
brew
in
body
color
and
head
o
another
solid
brew
from
rogue
ales
noice
o
a
fine
beer
but
overall
not
very
remarkable
moreys
bottom
line
i
have
no
way
of
telling
how
old
or
fresh
this
beer
is
but
im
going
to
assume
that
it
may
have
been
a
bit
hoppier
earlier
on
with
no
bottle
dating
or
sediment
im
left
to
review
as
is
a
decent
malty
fall
beer
wouldnt
buy
a
whole
sixer
if
left
up
to
me
though
o
from
the
aroma
of
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
start
from
the
taste
to
the
mouth
of
the
beer
it
kind
of
lost
me
overall
still
a
decent
beer
from
rogue
i
have
been
extremely
impressed
with
every
beer
i
have
tried
from
rogue
in
the
past
i
dont
know
whether
this
one
came
from
a
bad
batch
or
what
theres
just
no
dimension
or
flavor
to
it
its
got
almost
no
aftertaste
its
got
almost
no
taste
i
do
not
recomend
this
one
the
body
is
as
the
style
would
dictate
amber
in
color
with
some
dark
mahogany
hues
a
one
and
a
half
inch
head
offwhite
to
cream
in
color
develops
and
leaves
patches
of
bubbly
wet
lacing
as
it
subsides
the
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
toffee
some
caramel
faint
fruits
cherry
plum
and
some
citrusy
hops
taste
emphasizes
the
toasted
malt
though
the
caramel
is
also
readily
noticeable
the
citrus
and
fruit
shines
through
in
the
rear
mouth
is
very
smooth
throughout
but
finishes
a
touch
sticky
overall
a
very
good
amber
that
ill
gladly
have
again
overall
a
unique
tasting
ale
with
the
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
complimenting
each
other
quite
well
o
not
a
terrible
beer
has
some
deficiencies
but
is
still
drinkable
overall
a
good
brew
though
strongly
biased
toward
hoppy
bitterness
bottle
poured
into
glass
a
decent
enough
red
ale
just
kind
of
plain
and
subtly
underwhelming
allaround
pours
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
reddish
tint
and
an
one
finger
soapy
head
which
recedes
to
skim
but
does
leave
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
faint
i
got
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
the
beginning
but
mostly
got
an
earthy
like
almost
musty
aroma
the
taste
follows
suit
closely
there
is
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
the
end
of
the
beer
has
that
earthy
hop
bite
this
is
the
main
flavor
of
the
beer
that
i
got
the
mouthfeel
was
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
the
nose
was
a
little
faint
but
the
taste
was
better
it
did
just
kinda
leave
me
wanting
more
out
of
it
the
flavor
was
average
but
not
very
complex
overall
not
bad
flavours
seemed
a
little
attenuated
but
not
too
shabby
the
flavor
is
decent
and
well
balanced
the
hop
character
is
light
and
the
beer
finishes
with
a
malty
fruity
character
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
id
have
it
again
my
wife
love
it
and
got
mad
that
i
didnt
rate
it
higher
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
a
very
good
american
amber
beer
really
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
could
easily
do
a
session
with
these
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
malty
amber
beer
that
also
has
a
good
dryhopped
flavor
very
nice
this
it
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
dinner
meal
that
might
include
some
bar
bq
ribs
dark
ruby
with
cola
edges
an
off
white
head
dissipates
to
a
half
finger
of
loose
bubbles
vegetable
hop
nose
with
candied
malt
malty
up
front
but
less
than
the
smell
would
have
you
think
burnt
caramel
and
grain
herbal
hop
residue
pure
soft
water
very
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
bitters
in
the
dry
finish
overall
this
beer
really
isnt
that
bad
or
good
it
just
doesnt
live
up
what
the
label
suggests
and
is
just
your
basic
amber
ale
overall
very
nice
beer
i
usually
do
not
like
amber
ales
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
had
i
feel
this
is
largely
due
to
the
dry
hopping
they
used
this
was
a
solid
take
on
a
red
ale
from
rogue
and
i
liked
that
this
focused
a
bit
more
on
the
roasted
character
of
the
malts
than
their
regular
american
amber
ale
does
the
hops
didnt
quite
assert
themselves
like
i
would
have
expected
but
then
again
im
not
quite
sure
of
the
age
of
this
bottle
i
still
liked
what
i
found
here
though
and
would
definitely
try
this
on
draft
if
i
saw
it
this
is
another
great
rogue
beverage
prost
d
its
good
but
not
my
first
choice
have
yet
to
found
a
rogue
brew
i
disagree
with
wish
we
had
more
of
this
in
the
south
the
smell
and
taste
sort
of
remind
me
of
samuel
smith
indian
ale
but
with
more
intensity
not
bad
but
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
if
having
a
few
wondering
what
the
hops
used
were
though
lots
of
high
alpha
maybe
d
the
hops
are
a
little
strong
but
this
is
certainly
enjoyable
enough
to
go
back
to
for
a
few
more
just
wouldnt
make
it
my
regular
beer
of
choice
leaves
more
of
an
ipa
mouthfeel
than
a
red
a
hoppy
red
but
not
up
to
par
with
the
levels
brought
by
nugget
nectar
but
easily
a
second
tier
red
ale
12
a
6
pack
hurts
drinkability
of
this
beer
now
to
taste
right
off
the
bat
you
are
greeted
with
the
very
hoppy
and
aromatic
can
taste
be
aromatic
it
wasnt
too
hoppy
to
me
and
the
subsequent
taste
of
malts
helped
but
i
was
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
finish
a
great
beer
has
good
flavor
throughout
and
this
only
had
good
flavor
at
the
beginning
this
beer
has
changed
a
bit
in
the
last
few
years
the
bros
shoulld
update
presented
in
that
classic
rogue
22oz
bomer
with
a
very
informative
lable
this
particular
bottle
was
dedicated
to
a
bull
named
fukutsuru
cool
impressivly
clear
pour
considering
the
layer
of
yeast
in
the
bottom
gorgious
red
color
and
a
nice
lingering
lacy
off
white
head
really
sensuall
hop
aroma
of
spring
flowers
and
almost
berrylike
undertones
malt
is
resting
just
underneath
in
a
warm
bready
invitation
the
flavor
is
a
gentle
yet
assertive
fruity
purfumy
dose
of
hops
backed
up
by
a
full
buffet
of
toasty
bready
caramel
malt
it
is
nice
and
bitter
until
the
very
end
when
the
malt
tips
the
balance
and
gives
a
pleasent
flower
laced
toasty
bread
finish
the
malt
wakes
up
a
lot
as
it
warms
this
is
the
perfect
american
red
very
hoppy
without
being
too
bitter
very
malt
without
being
heavy
or
sweet
perfect
session
beer
i
could
drink
myself
stupid
and
back
on
this
if
i
could
only
get
a
meat
head
bar
owner
in
knoxville
to
carry
it
on
draft
slainte
over
all
not
really
impressed
with
this
rogue
i
expected
more
out
of
it
just
came
off
as
bland
and
simple
another
beer
to
mark
off
the
list
but
not
one
i
will
have
again
d
only
if
you
are
a
hophead
like
i
often
am
awesome
d
easy
to
drink
and
an
overall
good
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
sure
why
the
y
had
to
dry
hop
it
d
great
drinkability
the
flavors
are
pleasant
and
arent
overwhelming
i
am
getting
lots
of
flaws
here
or
what
i
think
of
as
flaws
soap
oil
diacetyl
all
mix
together
for
something
i
dont
care
for
much
not
something
i
would
recommend
typical
of
rogue
appearance
is
a
nice
redauburn
color
smelled
ok
but
didnt
have
the
big
citrusy
hop
aroma
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
dryhopped
ale
taste
was
also
disappointing
as
it
seemed
almost
a
bit
sour
mouthfeel
was
fine
and
the
drinkability
would
have
been
good
had
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
more
a
nice
beer
and
one
i
enjoyed
its
good
not
great
and
while
it
fits
the
bill
its
just
not
epic
d
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
from
rogue
i
did
take
my
time
with
it
but
it
was
pretty
good
d
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
these
beers
but
really
enjoyed
this
one
amber
color
beer
with
some
reddish
notes
nice
foamy
head
forms
up
but
disappear
quickly
the
aroma
is
hops
citrus
and
grapefruits
with
some
malts
too
caramel
malts
which
i
get
in
almost
all
rogue
brews
ive
tasted
so
far
the
smell
makes
me
want
to
go
for
a
sip
less
intense
on
the
taste
than
it
was
on
the
aroma
still
citrus
with
some
grapefruits
medium
bitterness
medium
body
carbonation
is
present
in
the
mouth
so
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
session
brew
from
rogue
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
an
average
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
caramel
like
with
pine
hops
and
a
touch
of
paper
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
when
i
was
drinking
it
was
was
a
little
torn
between
good
and
not
so
good
d
the
overall
taste
and
characteristic
of
the
body
make
this
a
nice
brew
but
nothing
that
is
worth
writing
home
about
the
beer
pours
a
pleasant
light
chocolate
amber
in
color
and
produces
a
two
finger
white
head
with
huge
bubbles
in
the
aroma
the
sweet
malt
and
roasted
chocolate
stand
out
in
the
front
but
there
are
traces
of
citrus
in
the
finish
bitter
citrus
fruits
take
precedence
in
the
flavor
and
there
is
a
nice
chocolate
toffee
element
holding
things
together
the
body
is
thin
and
watery
with
huge
carbonation
overall
im
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
bear
republics
red
rocket
just
blows
this
beer
out
of
the
water
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
too
thin
and
watery
with
a
washed
out
flavor
pours
a
mediumdark
golden
brown
with
a
few
fingers
of
yellowishoff
white
head
sticky
lace
and
a
nice
layer
of
head
is
retained
nose
is
full
of
hops
lots
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
and
the
toffee
notes
from
the
malts
stand
out
real
well
some
lighter
tropical
fruits
make
their
way
in
there
too
some
drying
grassy
notes
also
decent
in
taste
as
well
citrus
notes
arent
as
prominent
but
work
with
the
toffee
malt
which
stands
out
here
highly
carbonated
and
feels
fairly
watery
dry
finish
with
lingering
bitterness
reasonable
drinkability
although
im
not
sure
id
pursue
it
on
my
own
decent
effort
nice
to
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
to
me
there
is
no
ideal
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
all
situational
i
want
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
meal
but
if
its
dessert
or
with
a
cigar
or
something
then
its
different
drinkability
would
like
the
hop
to
last
a
bit
longer
i
wont
write
this
one
off
but
the
next
one
will
need
to
be
free
cheers
dits
ok
overall
this
is
a
kickass
red
ale
and
definitely
how
theyre
supposed
to
be
made
the
only
other
one
ive
enjoyed
this
much
was
bear
republics
red
ale
which
is
equally
as
hoppy
and
delicious
i
hate
plain
jane
malty
and
unenthusiastic
reds
and
this
is
anything
but
kudos
rogue
now
just
dont
be
so
damn
expensive
d
i
could
have
more
than
one
but
at
the
price
here
in
missouri
i
could
find
better
for
the
price
as
cask
ales
go
this
was
quite
good
although
i
suspect
this
is
even
better
with
a
bit
more
fizz
in
a
bottle
a
very
peachy
aroma
slams
the
nose
with
edges
of
oranges
and
yeast
fruit
everywhere
in
the
taste
more
peaches
pears
apples
theres
a
whole
freakin
orchard
in
that
cask
also
a
barrel
of
malt
theres
a
feathery
hit
of
hops
at
the
end
but
is
barely
noticeable
the
nearly
nonexistent
carbonation
gives
it
a
heavy
feel
and
makes
it
something
to
drink
slowly
nice
but
not
quite
right
for
the
hot
summery
weather
when
i
tried
it
would
be
even
better
in
the
fall
md
very
full
bodied
and
smooth
drinker
in
which
you
could
knock
down
a
couple
of
these
before
you
catch
yourself
taste
like
it
smells
caramel
malts
are
well
balanced
with
hopped
up
flavors
pairing
carnitas
taco
with
salsa
verde
and
onion
mostly
because
thats
my
go
to
session
food
clear
copperred
pour
with
quickly
fading
head
and
nice
lacing
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
pine
also
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
roasty
caramel
malt
dominating
nicely
balanced
with
some
piney
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
somewhere
between
creamy
and
syrupy
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
decent
interpretation

bitter
cherrygrapefruit
drinkability
for
almost
a
red
ale
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
beers
best
features
ok
but
not
that
good
of
a
value
buy
again
no
the
drinkability
as
always
is
pretty
good
although
i
can
see
how
the
bitter
finish
would
throw
people
off
and
steer
them
away
from
high
ratings
in
this
category
but
seriously
to
each
his
own
and
i
really
enjoy
the
finish
of
this
brew
so
i
gotta
go
high
on
this
drinkability
the
malty
flavors
make
the
bitter
beginning
a
contrast
to
enjoy
and
make
it
easy
to
drink
taste
is
of
grain
roasted
malt
hops
malt
nice
citrus
flavors
around
the
edges
and
caramel
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
dry
and
bitter
d
if
they
made
a
12
pack
id
never
have
indecision
at
the
store
agian
and
id
be
a
very
broke
man
nothing
too
memorable
here
but
a
pleasant
brew
for
sure
dry
hopped
st
rogue
red
ale
is
a
hazy
red
ale
with
a
blotchy
yellowish
offwhite
head
that
has
outstanding
lacing
it
has
a
very
hoppy
aroma
like
orange
peel
and
pine
needles
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
dry
finish
it
tastes
really
hoppy
its
pretty
fruity
but
not
sweet
theres
lots
of
grapefruit
flavor
this
is
pretty
much
how
a
red
ale
should
be
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
but
also
not
a
beer
that
jumps
out
at
me
and
says
grab
another
two
or
three
glad
i
have
some
more
d
very
drinkable
and
an
interesting
interpretation
of
an
amber
ale
light
bodied
thin
and
watery
this
becomes
less
of
an
issue
as
the
beers
palatability
increases
but
its
still
undesirable
not
terrible
but
could
have
been
so
much
better
i
will
defiantly
be
buying
this
in
the
future
i
love
this
beer
and
am
angry
that
all
i
got
was
one
in
a
mixed
6
pack
amberish
red
beer
with
pretty
decent
lacing
and
a
truly
awesome
tastethis
is
a
hoppierthanaverage
amber
ale
lots
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
with
the
caramel
a
great
hoppy
beer
without
the
bitterness
of
an
ipa
also
a
very
full
and
warm
tasting
beer
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
long
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
and
i
would
have
definitely
liked
the
beer
to
be
a
little
more
lively
in
terms
of
carbonation
this
is
the
only
amber
red
ale
ive
ever
had
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
of
this
style
before
i
pass
judgement
on
this
one
nothing
crazy
just
solid
enjoyable
every
day
beer
na
zdravje
overall
i
will
definately
drink
this
on
the
regular
and
suggest
you
all
give
it
a
shot
well
worth
the
13
bucks
for
a
six
pack
a
deep
orange
hued
amber
color
with
an
average
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
it
has
a
roasty
malt
scent
backed
by
some
floral
notes
with
a
biscuity
caramel
malt
flavor
mixed
with
some
piney
herbal
hop
it
has
a
nice
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
and
while
not
a
standout
is
still
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
drinkability
i
doubt
i
could
have
more
then
two
in
a
night
as
it
borders
heavy
however
its
a
surprising
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
is
well
worth
the
taste
overall
i
was
hugely
disappointed
in
this
beer
fairly
drinkable
could
definitely
session
this
red
ale
bottle
into
pint
glass
the
pour
was
a
hazy
deep
red
with
a
half
finger
creamy
white
head
aromas
were
at
first
heavy
of
a
sweet
pine
as
well
as
a
hint
of
sharp
citrus
already
this
was
a
little
complex
the
first
tastes
reinforced
the
pine
elements
and
a
lingering
aftertaste
allowed
some
of
the
sweet
citrus
develop
overall
it
was
very
calm
in
the
mouth
which
was
very
refreshing
and
allowed
the
flavors
to
develop
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drink
that
was
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
buffalo
bitesi
enjoyed
it
with
i
was
not
as
impressed
with
this
one
it
did
not
have
the
complexity
that
i
was
looking
for
i
much
prefer
redhook
esb
it
has
the
classic
hoppy
red
beer
that
i
look
for
a
great
beer
with
plenty
to
offer
mouthfeel
needs
some
work
d
this
beer
has
good
balance
good
carbonation
and
a
lowish
alcohol
content
which
could
make
it
a
decent
session
beer
for
those
who
like
this
style
but
it
behaves
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
straight
red
ale
expensive
for
a
six
but
i
may
try
it
again
cheers
yep
shes
a
redhead
alright
with
all
the
spunk
and
fire
to
go
along
nice
nose
to
her
but
not
like
some
of
the
hoppy
blondes
i
usually
chase
after
i
poured
her
into
a
tulip
which
works
wonders
for
my
dipas
but
it
gave
it
an
almost
metallic
smell
with
some
malts
and
hops
to
follow
i
got
about
one
inch
of
head
with
some
residue
on
the
sides
ill
end
my
review
now
and
take
another
shot
at
her
at
a
later
date
because
this
particular
one
is
not
as
great
as
some
i
have
had
in
the
past
maybe
it
is
because
i
am
not
actually
in
the
navy
club
drinking
it
with
a
pool
cue
eck
taste
is
weird
has
some
metallic
and
really
off
flavors
not
sure
if
this
is
intentional
or
what
really
not
worth
drinking
its
maybe
a
bit
oxidized
im
not
a
fan
taste
is
very
watery
up
front
a
background
of
carmel
brought
in
by
some
piney
hops
but
overall
thin
and
watery
and
slightly
sour
i
honestly
just
think
this
beer
is
old
but
since
theres
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
i
have
no
idea
d
very
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
this
more
that
most
of
roques
line
d
really
drinkable
sessionable
solid
amber
ale
rogue
still
hasnt
done
me
wrong
and
im
not
sure
they
ever
will
nuff
said
smooth
moderately
rich
mouthfeel
a
solid
red
ale
more
of
a
session
style
with
low
to
medium
tannins
and
medium
alcohol
great
beer
to
prime
the
palate
for
their
heavyweights
would
not
purchase
again
nice
offwhite
head
rich
amber
color
fairly
dark
still
translucent
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
bubbles
smell
is
of
fresh
hops
and
caramel
some
vanilla
sweetness
as
well
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
a
bit
of
hops
filling
out
the
flavor
crisp
and
refreshing
very
tasty
medium
bodied
and
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
this
brewery

really
enjoy
the
blend
of
hops
and
red
ale
good
for
when
you
want
the
hop
flavor
without
the
ipa
tried
this
brew
last
night
at
the
yard
house
in
waikiki
last
night
it
was
my
first
of
the
night
rather
appropriate
for
my
very
first
review
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
finger
of
pale
head
that
left
lacing
about
halfway
down
the
glass
though
not
overpowering
the
hops
and
malt
were
clearly
evident
in
the
aroma
even
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
first
tase
had
a
rich
malt
flavor
with
the
hops
coming
in
prominently
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
mild
but
noticeable
alcohol
tinge
to
it
rich
almost
chewy
feel
going
down
despite
the
low
carbonation
and
extremely
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
as
a
session
beer
wherever
possible
as
i
could
drink
this
all
throughout
the
night
dno
thank
you
way
overpriced
too
bad
it
looked
great
smelled
good
but
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
horribly
lacking
d
this
was
a
really
good
beer
i
wish
the
6
packs
were
available
down
here
i
would
really
buy
a
lot
of
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
and
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
red
at
all
i
could
use
a
7
triple
dryhopped
version
but
this
will
do
as
a
fantastic
session
brew
price
was
a
bit
steep
on
the
6pack
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
w
my
judging
of
the
actual
beer
or
review
here
drinkability
another
good
beer
by
rogue
and
something
i
would
love
to
session
if
it
werent
so
expensive
expensive
by
the
standards
of
a
college
student
not
something
i
would
drink
again
its
a
hard
to
categorize
brew
and
it
does
poorly
as
an
amberred
but
i
wouldnt
score
higher
as
a
specialty
either
rogue
puts
out
some
lovely
brews
but
this
is
a
miss
with
me
rather
sessionable
and
also
very
drinkable
the
hops
are
great
and
fit
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
recommended
drinkability
another
great
beer
from
a
brewery
that
has
yet
to
dissapoint
me
drinkability
im
a
rogue
fan
this
is
not
an
exception
to
that
its
a
nice
roguey
interpretation
of
a
red
ale
big
smell
and
taste
but
not
perfectly
put
together
overall
its
quite
enjoyable
d
decent
brew
not
my
fave
but
id
buy
again
and
drink
from
time
to
time
the
price
range
would
make
it
better
for
me
but
still
a
beer
ill
splurge
on
to
take
to
a
party
when
i
just
want
something
nice
this
beer
pours
a
rich
red
mahogany
hue
with
vivid
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
prominent
lacing
all
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
impressive
lookingit
has
fruity
aromas
of
stonefruitmelon
and
some
caramel
maltinessit
has
a
nice
fullish
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
stonefruits
and
tropical
fruits
flooding
the
palette
and
ending
with
a
nice
caramel
malty
bitter
edgea
very
nice
beer
prob
up
there
with
this
breweries
best
in
my
books
as
far
as
drinkability
its
delicious
and
relatively
light
i
could
drink
it
all
day
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
d
good
drinkability
wish
it
were
hoppier
though
the
malt
profile
is
big
making
the
hops
a
nice
sidekick
not
a
big
hoppy
bitter
brew
a
pleasant
drinkable
brew
that
pairs
well
with
lots
of
foods
spicy
foods
and
pub
food
esp
other
comments
the
aroma
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
the
dryhopping
has
done
its
magic
very
lush
and
textured
did
not
finish
the
bottle
cannot
recommend
drinkabkle
and
delectable
i
really
like
this

a

good
with

but
one

is

fairly

for
a

overall
a

brew
just
a
little
imbalanced
great

refreshing
and
it
clocks
in

very
drinkable
its
just
dissapointing
that
it
costs
a15bomber
here
in
oz
this
beer
has
a
deep
reddish
color
with
a
deep
hue
of
amber
plenty
of
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
during
the
duration
of
me
enjoying
this
beverage
the
aroma
not
surprising
is
very
hoppy
and
citric
lots
of
toasted
malt
in
the
flavor
there
is
plenty
of
dry
crackery
malt
and
lots
of
floral
hops
which
could
could
be
shared
with
the
people
around
me
the
dryness
is
a
bit
intense
enough
to
slow
down
the
drinkability
but
its
not
enough
to
keep
me
from
enjoying
this
offering
this
beer
would
be
great
with
a
good
burger
or
steak
as
it
is
not
overpowering
and
its
smooth
start
to
finish
first
tried
this
beer
at
a
festival
and
fell
in
love
with
it
this
review
is
of
a
six
pack
that
i
picked
up
last
week
have
to
say
it
doesnt
live
up
to
my
memory
of
it
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
is
still
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
remembered
beer
poured
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
died
down
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
decent
lace
on
the
glass
color
was
a
hazy
redish
amber
nose
was
nicely
floral
citrusy
from
the
dry
hopping
good
mouthfeel
slightly
oily
with
malt
becoming
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warmed
in
the
hand
overall
a
drinkable
beer
just
not
as
good
as
my
first
experience
with
it
perhaps
the
festivals
version
was
fresher
cheers
a
real
shame
because
it
was
expensive
overall
this
was
the
first
rogue
ive
had
since
i
really
got
into
crafts
its
got
a
unique
look
to
it
and
all
the
other
features
fit
everything
a
good
complexyetbalanced
amber
should
follow
also
try
the
santas
private
reserve
ale
d
goes
down
really
smoothly
nice
hoppy
red
ale
im
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
one
it
pours
a
lovely
amberredbrown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
hop
forward
with
a
strong
pinecitric
flavor
but
a
mild
but
sweet
caramel
malt
is
still
evident
its
not
a
perfectly
balanced
amber
like
some
but
it
works
well
for
me
it
is
refreshingly
bitter
with
an
undercurrent
of
pleasant
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
healthy
hop
bite
in
the
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
my
palate
but
i
understand
the
argument
of
the
antihoppedupambers
crowd
d
everythings
better
when
its
dry
hopped
rogue
did
a
great
job
with
this
amberred
ale
could
have
used
a
little
more
hop
flavor
all
around
a
solid
brew
while
not
too
bitter
its
also
not
at
all
what
i
expected
i
imagine
that
others
would
like
this
brew
better
but
i
did
not
finish
12
ounces
poured
from
a
bomber
the
beer
pours
truly
red
it
has
a
good
head
that
stays
around
during
quaffing
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
fo
this
style
but
as
it
warms
it
becomes
tolerable
the
nose
is
a
bit
dissappointing
its
all
hops
just
piney
clean
hops
the
flavor
expresses
more
though
the
malt
shows
with
toasty
notes
and
faint
sweetness
it
finishes
dry
with
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
of
this
red
is
pretty
average
medium
bodied
and
flavorful
but
it
is
almost
too
clean
each
sip
goes
down
and
the
flavor
is
gone
just
as
fast
overall
st
rogue
is
very
easy
to
drink
rather
than
the
food
pairings
on
the
bottle
i
could
have
this
beer
with
mild
cheeses
or
with
oily
fish
smoked
salmon
would
be
a
perfect
snack
with
this
brew
overall
mildly
disappointed
the
mouthfeel
and
vague
offtastes
set
this
beer
back
a
little
for
me
ok
beer
but
not
enough
to
have
me
eager
to
return
for
another
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
many
better
amber
ales
to
be
had
d
very
well
balanced
enough
carbonation
no
to
malty
or
hoppy
enough
balance
to
cool
you
down
love
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
amber
and
produces
a
small
thick
head
that
leaves
almost
no
lacing
does
not
look
very
carbonated
with
few
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
smells
hop
forward
hints
of
mellow
citrus
with
no
real
malt
character
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
alright
once
again
being
dry
hopped
you
get
a
mouth
full
of
refreshing
hop
character
that
is
kind
of
muted
by
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
waterybut
crip
and
refreshing
good
for
tipping
back
a
few
but
hurts
this
brew
on
its
score
good
offering
but
a
little
expensive
this
is
a
mild
red
ale
that
started
out
looking
and
smelling
perfect
im
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
flavors
offered
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
sessionable
one
based
on
the
taste
and
feel
quite
drinkable
i
prefer
a
few
others
out
there
but
this
simply
stellar
there
are
many
hoppy
brews
out
there
and
not
all
are
ipas
etc
this
is
a
nice
extension
of
the
spectrum

is
a
great
red
ale
it
catches
you
off
guard
because
its
very
heavy
on
the
hops
a
bit
more
extreme
take
on
the
style
really
good
brew
from
rogue
this
isnt
my
favorite
red
ale
as
i
do
prefer
a
stronger
mouthfeel
and
less
hops
in
this
style
of
beer
but
i
would
recommend
others
give
this
beer
a
try
i
would
order
it
again
given
the
opportunity
this
is
a
good
example
of
red
ale
for
me
d
the
metallic
phenolic
taste
was
very
offputting
at
first
i
found
that
as
the
beer
warmed
up
more
this
flavor
wasnt
as
much
in
the
forefront
im
going
to
assume
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
and
try
it
again
sometime
otherwise
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
like
this
a
lot
and
its
exceptionally
sessionable
really
i
wish
i
had
more
than
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
of
this
right
now
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
most
certainly
by
again
wont
be
tomorrow
but
im
sure
i
will
get
a
craving
for
it
sometime
in
the
future
overall
the
oatmeal
cookie
malt
and
grapefruit
hop
dont
mesh
well
for
me
future
outlook
a
good
but
not
great
beer
id
be
happy
to
have
this
again
but
probably
wont
make
a
special
effort
to
seek
it
out
thine

i

the

tits
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium

crisp
and
actually
quite
clean
low

moderate

the
relatively
low

lends
itself
to
the
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
and
could
be
an
excellent
dinner
brew
with
the
right
food
pairings
i
poured
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
amber
red
with
large
creamy
head
and
some
lacing
i
thought
it
had
a
good
hoppy
sweet
smell
but
found
the
taste
to
be
a
perfect
mixture
of
bitterness
with
the
caramel
undertones
the
5
alcohol
and
subdued
flavor
made
this
a
beer
that
everyone
would
enjoy
truly
a
sessionable
beer
in
my
book
with
a
light
smooth
mouth
feel
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
good
amount
of
head
and
ok
lacing
slightly
spicy
hoppy
scent
taste
is
a
very
subdued
earthy
malt
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
very
dry
would
probably
be
more
suited
to
drinking
with
a
meal
than
an
evening
of
refreshment
lighter
than
expected
but
for
a
session
beer
very
solid
easy
drinker
and
should
go
well
with
american
lunch
or
dinner
or
a
summer
refresher
much
better
than
your
normal
lawnmower
beer
i
would
take
this
one
strong
scent
of
hops
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
slight
malt
note
strong
hop
taste
with
an
initial
sweet
honey
like
touch
and
finishes
a
tingly
bitter
and
dry
drinks
with
a
sticky
texture
the
hops
hide
the
taste
of
alcohol
but
it
should
not
go
unnoticed
d
an
admirable
amber
red
ale
solid
in
all
regards
and
quite
sessionable
at
5
1
abv
not
the
best
in
class
but
a
brew
that
i
would
never
shy
away
from
in
the
future
verdict
a
tasty
worthwhile
endeavor
by
the
brewer
but
probably
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
to
drink
on
its
own
not
really
feeling
this
bottle
its
not
bad
but
its
certainly
not
on
par
with
some
other
rogue
offerings
i
dont
mind
quaffing
a
bomber
especially
at
the
low
abv
but
certainly
wouldnt
be
reaching
for
another
as
my
first
choice
this
makes
a
really
interesting
contrast
to
an
english
amber
ale
not
any
less
sweet
but
considerably
more
dry
and
bitter
personally
i
find
it
less
drinkable
than
good
english
ambers
but
still
an
tasty
and
interesting
beer
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
large
substantia
three
inch
head
on
top
the
head
laces
slowly
leaving
hints
of
its
creamy
color
along
the
way
a
malty
fragrance
at
first
scent
then
a
strong
citrusy
scent
that
is
strong
on
the
lemony
side
a
touch
of
pine
and
grass
finishes
off
every
scent
the
malt
is
particularly
all
the
way
through
its
prescence
never
seems
to
leave
your
palate
a
mild
bitterness
comes
in
the
end
that
is
grassy
bringing
a
grassy
aftertaste
the
feel
very
thin
at
the
front
slowly
gainsweight
and
becomes
a
light
medium
bodied
fell
at
the
end
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
truly
at
a
high
standard
the
taste
and
the
feel
the
taste
being
the
most
important
seem
to
be
lacking
those
aspects
bring
this
beer
down
the
beer
has
lightmedium
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
d
at
5
1
with
reasonable
carbonation
low
bitterness
and
a
great
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
terrific
session
brew
its
not
nugget
nectar
but
its
a
solid
red
ale
the
taste
is
more
malty
than
hops
but
it
has
some
well
defined
bitterness
the
malts
are
very
sweet
and
can
be
compared
again
to
caramel
the
mouthfeel
has
a
slick
feel
to
it
but
it
is
a
bit
too
watery
it
drinks

easily

my
first

beer
from

its
decent
and
drinkable
but
nothing
particularly
interesting
dry
hopped
red
ale
is
damn
good
beer
very
solid
allaround
i
think
it
lacks
a
little
in
depth
but
does
have
enough
flavor
to
more
than
hold
its
own
im
still
intrigued
by
the
dry
hopped
labeling
is
that
a
new
thing
i
dont
know
in
any
event
this
is
a
very
good
beer
thats
well
worth
checking
out
devery
one

is
a
little
differnt
from
the
lasti
just
cant
get
enough
now
to
the
beer
its
got
a
nice
appearance
not
quite
red
but
almost
beyond
brown
the
head
did
have
some
hints
of
a
dark
red
the
smell
was
nice
the
taste
was
not
very
hoppy
but
enough
to
balance
a
nice
nutty
flavor
offered
by
the
malts
im
tasting
walnuts
the
taste
diminishes
smoothly
and
leaves
a
mellow
refreshing
aftertaste
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
could
drink
this
all
day
long
nothing
too
interesting
about
it
but
a
solid
brew
none

medium

full

slightly

nothing

red
from
rogue
ales
brewery
brewers
on
the
bay
is
reddish
amber
in
color
and
has
a
malt
and
hop
nose
i
really
like
these
dryhopped
beers
tastes
great
and
reminds
me
of
a
hoppier
version
of
american
amber
ale
starts
malty
and
finishes
hoppy
and
somewhat
dry
as
ive
stated
in
other
reviews
i
find
the
rogue
brand
quite
tasteful
with
a
unique
flavor
best
of
all
is
that
several
rogue
beers
are
available
here
in
the
jungles
of
alabama
a
big
floral
beer
that
is
very
different
from
anything
i
have
tasted
before
very
nice
and
enjoyable
almost
oak
like
in
character
to
some
degree
about
to
drink
the
rest
of
the
bottle
with
some
grilled
lamb
and
vegies
right
now
a
bic
lighter
popped
the
top
of
this
12oz
bottle
i
put
my
nose
to
the
top
and
got
a
hit
of
pepper
spice
poured
the
dark
red
fluid
into
my
glass
and
again
put
my
nose
to
the
top
but
this
time
to
a
half
inch
head
smells
like
fresh
caramel
tastes
like
a
nicely
balanced
red
ale
with
no
uncomfortable
elements
and
a
after
taste
just
like
how
it
first
hit
my
lips
ya
after
a
victory
hop
wallop
this
is
a
great
chaser
i
picked
some
good
beers
for
myself
tonight
so
im
chillin
overal
decent
beer
very
much
a
west
coast
american
red
ale
not
to
be
confused
with
the
irish
reds
and
the
like
its
dryhopped
and
tastes
of
malt
followed
by
fruit
and
fairly
strong
piney
hops
flavors
could
be
the
most
hopped
red
ale
ive
sampled
makes
me
curious
what
their
india
red
ale
is
like
under
the
tracktown
label
or
their
imperial
red
in
the
swingtop
bottle
if
i
had
15
dollars
to
spend
on
one
beer
id
know
this
beer
was
light
on
the
taste
buds
and
had
a
crisp
feel
very
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
more
of
course
that
means
if
its
there
i
wouldnt
say
no
color
is
a
beautiful
clear
mahogany
and
head
is
fairly
thick
if
not
too
persistent
aroma
is
strong
and
richly
hoppy
though
not
evergreenish
flavor
is
delightfully
hoppy
and
only
a
little
bitter
with
nutty
and
fruity
hints
and
even
a
touch
of
smoke
texture
is
exceptionally
smooth
so
it
goes
down
very
pleasantly
another
winner
from
rogue
d
great
beer
nice
flavor
overall
this
is
a
great
clean
refreshing
beer
by
rogue
nothing
extreme
but
definitely
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
could
be
an
old
beer
though
ive
seen
dustier
on
that
shelf
at
goodrichs
but
dissappointing
especially
after
such
a
tease
as
that
beautiful
unique
head
d
this
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
with
the
citrus
hops
aftertaste
drinkability
is
topnotch
here
its
also
low
in
alcohol
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
the
fact
that
its
available
in
six
packs
makes
it
even
more
accessible
since
the
bombers
are
expensive
got
this
one
on
tap
at
the
big
hunt
with
the
waitress
calling
it
a
rogue
hop
red
had
to
meander
up
to
the
bar
to
figure
out
what
was
actually
going
on
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
much
better
than
i
remember
it
being
out
of
the
bottle
a
ton
of
malt
makes
this
one
fairly
unique
for
most
american
ambers
which
seem
to
basically
be
slightly
spicier
maltier
ipas
this
one
almost
fell
into
maybe
an
imperial
oktoberfest
or
something
wouldnt
that
style
be
something
also
had
a
ton
of
huge
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
including
a
ton
of
raisins
and
peaches
excellent
appearance
with
a
huge
floaty
head
and
incredible
lacing
body
is
likewise
incredibly
thick
and
creamy
a
definite
surprise
for
the
style
really
liked
it
and
would
get
it
again
d
a
pretty
good
rogue
beer
however
pretty
good
is
below
the
usual
level
for
this
exceptional
brewery
i
like
the
mellower
character
but
more
body
from
a
heavier
malt
load
would
be
welcome
this
is
a
nice
version
of
a
red
very
drinkable
poured
a
nice
goldenamber
head
nice
hop
taste
and
slight
hoppy
aroma
for
only
44
ibus
a
wellbalanced
beer
one
of
my
favorite
rogues
i
like
the
story
about
fukutsuru
the
bull
for
which
the
beer
is
dedicated
tastes
of
hop
bitterness
some
spice
sweet
malts
and
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
finish
overall
very
nice
for
a
hopbomb
red
a
nice
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
a
red
ale
even
if
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
id
gladly
revisit
this
again
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
drinkability
overall
a
decent
brew
something
different
and
worth
trying
not
my
top
rogue
beer
could
be
a
bad
or
old
bottle
d
it
was
good
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
its
nothing
too
complicated
but
could
become
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
d
not
too
bad
but
there
was
just
something
different
about
this
brew
probably
not
something
ill
go
hunting
for
a
very
deceiving
ale
the
aroma
indicated
a
malt
dominated
brew
but
the
flavor
was
just
about
all
citrusy
bitterness
i
was
expecting
a
heavier
more
balanced
ale
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
lightbodied
crisp
bitterness
d
well
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
anyways

a
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
reddish
highlights
theres
a
nice
half
inch
of
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smell
is
piney
hops
but
an
abundance
of
malts
theres
not
enough
hops
to
stand
up
to
the
roasted
malt
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
creamy
taste
the
smell
is
slightly
malty
with
some
distant
hop
aroma
you
get
a
floral
aroma
and
some
graininess
faint
caramel
smell
hits
the
nose
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
the
dry
hoppiness
on
the
finish
you
also
get
some
of
the
roasted
caramel
in
the
finish
as
well
in
the
mouth
it
is
well
carbonated
but
not
a
lot
going
on
overall
a
really
good
amber
from
the
boys
at
the
beach
unclear
garnet
body
with
a
moussy
amber
head
that
reduces
to
a
lingering
film
with
coarse
lacing
aroma
is
big
hops
piney
resiny
grapefruit
with
some
earthywoody
undertones
the
hops
are
underlined
by
some
dark
fruit
from
crystal
malt
creating
a
berryish
smell
flavour
is
sweet
again
heavy
american
hop
dry
hop
crispness
but
not
overly
bitter
malt
comes
through
at
the
end
some
nutty
munich
notes
and
a
nice
hit
of
berry
from
the
crystal
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
lightened
by
prickly
carbonation
perfectly
balanced
wonderful
and
refreshingly
innovative
im
starting
to
think
rogue
bombers
might
be
worth
their
exhorbitant
price
out
here
there
will
be
no
writing
home
about
this
beer
its
a
good
example
of
dry
hopping
as
the
hops
are
really
the
only
flavor
that
is
really
noticeable
its
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
for
a
while
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
amber
color
with
a
magnificent
light
tan
chunky
head
great
lacing
left
along
the
pint
glass
smells
of
citrus
spicy
malts
hop
spice
taste
is
nothing
extraordinary
but
extremely
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
biscuity
malts
balanced
out
with
citrusy
hops
good
slightly
dry
hoppy
finish
although
slight
taste
of
metal
is
prevalent
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
excellent
session
brew
drinkability
very
easygoing
given
its
thinness
and
muted
flavors
its
refreshing
though
and
would
be
nice
on
a
summer
day
when
youre
looking
for
something
hoppy
but
not
too
heavy
d
overall
a
good
red
ale
probably
worth
a
try
the
beer
was
a
medium
amber
and
had
a
slightly
tan
head
the
aroma
was
slightly
fruity
but
made
the
thick
body
evident
the
falvor
was
t
h
i
c
k
and
hung
around
for
some
time
this
isnt
one
to
guzzle
down
several
at
a
time
order
one
and
savor
it
md
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
leaves
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
so
much
that
it
turns
you
off
to
the
beer
the
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
good
carbonation
level
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
every
so
often
st
rogue
red
is
a
very
fine
american
amber
i
am
a
big
fan
of
rogue
and
this
is
not
bad
i
dont
like
this
as
much
as
some
of
theirs
but
worth
a
try
d
very
nice
and
easy
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
not
for
the
price
would
not
seek
out
again
but
a
good
everyday
drinker
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
example
of
an
american
red
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
this
has
been
an
interesting
general
style
to
experiment
with
and
has
been
an
enjoyable
journey
i
dont
know
if
it
is
intriguing
enough
to
be
aregular
selection
but
certainly
worth
a
try
d
i
respect
the
effort
for
this
beer
but
there
isnt
enough
malt
to
justify
the
intense
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
all
wrong
too
ill
probably
have
trouble
finishing
this
glass
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
unless
curiousity
gets
the
better
of
me
in
the
future
d
doesnt
seem
like
it
would
fill
you
up
too
quickly
and
its
actually
a
very
refreshing
beer
to
drink
the
alcohol
content
is
just
right
if
you
want
to
put
down
2
or
so
and
still
drive
a
nice
job
all
around
as
for
the
flavor
it
delivers
a
nearperfect
balance
of
caramel
amber
malts
alongside
a
piney
hop
note
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
just
wellcrafted
deliciousness
from
rogue
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
creamy
body
and
excellent
carbonation
resinous
earthy
hops
give
st
rogue
red
a
bitter
finish
pairs
well
with
pasta
red
sauce
this
brew
is
the
epitome
of
the
american
amber
style
and
one
i
highly
recommend
very
drinkableenjoyable
beer
hop
dominated
as
expected
from
the
dry
hopping
but
balanced
nicely
by
the
malt
so
as
not
to
make
it
overpowering
pours
a
deep
copperamber
with
a
copper
tinted
white
head
that
hangs
around
a
decent
amount
of
time
head
gives
way
to
light
and
spotty
lacing
smells
of
hops
as
one
may
guess
a
little
bready
aroma
comes
through
on
a
deeper
draw
it
tastes
really
good
for
a
red
ale
the
hops
are
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
i
would
have
thought
but
are
not
overwhelming
light
and
creamy
mouthfeel
thats
very
easy
to
drink
another
winner
from
rogue
sorry
for
the
quick
overview
gotta
run
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
red
with
a
nice
finger
head
and
it
has
a
good
head
retention
the
beer
has
a
very
floral
hoppy
nose
to
it
with
a
sweet
malty
undertone
this
beer
has
an
interesting
flavour
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
flavour
that
reminds
me
of
syrupy
fruits
to
it
the
hops
arent
much
in
the
flavour
however
its
pretty
bitter
at
the
end
of
the
tasting
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
though
but
its
very
balanced
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
creamy
i
could
probably
only
drink
a
few
of
these
all
in
all
not
bad
but
not
great
either
good
taste
and
drinkablility
but
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
is
okay
but
not
what
i
expected
i
guess
i
just
didnt
expect
to
be
so
sweet
given
the
dryhopped
title
and
generally
expect
redsambers
to
have
a
toasty
malt
flavor
rather
than
a
supersweet
one
this
ones
average
imo
as
far
a
rogues
go
if
theres
any
criticism
this
beer
really
suffers
from
not
being
fresh
and
rogue
doesnt
do
a
great
job
of
letting
you
know
how
fresh
their
beer
is
find
a
purveyor
that
turns
over
their
beer
and
pick
up
a
bottle
overall
a
good
beernothing
spectacular
d
overall
a
good
beer
but
there
are
many
better
dryhopped
reds
red
horse
from
sac
brew
immediately
comes
to
mind
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
medcopper
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
which
lasts
for
an
eternity
than
coats
my
nonic
entirely
a
strong
citrus
hop
aroma
with
some
cereal
and
darker
grains
in
the
mix
a
good
initial
hop
bite
and
flavor
that
quickly
peters
out
leaving
a
more
subtle
bread
and
nuts
a
little
thin
on
the
flavor
finishes
crisp
and
slightly
mineral
a
light
body
made
creamier
by
the
great
amount
of
co2
popped
the
top
w
a
lighter
shot
it
over
20
ft
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
not
quite
flavorful
enough
to
stand
out
prosit
mk
d
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
and
i
will
enjoy
the
other
three
that
i
have
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
ever
buy
this
beer
again
for
it
is
not
anything
to
write
home
about
it
is
one
of
the
more
mediocre
beers
from
rogue
which
brews
some
pretty
amazing
stuff
dry
hopped
red
deep
reddish
amber
with
an
enduring
tan
cap
leafy
hop
aroma
with
hints
of
pine
is
overshadowed
by
apricotlike
fruity
esters
begins
with
a
bubbly
rush
of
toasty
malt
which
is
restrained
in
its
sweetness
and
quickly
becomes
a
bit
astringent
as
the
hops
come
in
a
pithy
citric
punch
towards
the
finish
ends
any
malt
sweetness
for
a
snappy
clean
finish
nice
restrained
dried
fruit
malt
flavors
integrate
well
with
some
classic
nw
hop
notes
one
of
rogues
leaner
beers
this
would
make
a
nice
session
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
overcarbonated
but
an
agressive
pour
and
a
little
foaming
helps
this
settle
one
of
rogues
best
brews
overall
an
ok
beer
but
the
relative
lack
of
balance
will
probably
keep
me
from
buying
this
again
any
time
soon
d
goes
down
well
for
such
a
heavybodied
brew
md
its
lighttomedium
bodied
with
average
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
slightly
waterysilky
smooth
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
only
lightly
dryingnot
what
i
would
expect
from
a
dry
hopped
beer
such
as
this
its
fairly
drinkable
because
of
the
body
and
interesting
flavor
st
rogue
red
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
if
i
cared
for
it
more
id
buy
it
frequently
smooth
with
plenty
carbonation
that
fits
the
beer
nicely
but
otherwise
a
little
watery
in
the
mouth
not
bad
plenty
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
medium
heaviness
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
high
bitterness
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
an
interesting
take
on
an
american
amber
and
will
appeal
to
hopheads
and
fans
of
the
style
alike
this
was
an
impressive
beer
and
one
ill
certainly
enjoy
again
it
did
cost
a
couple
dollars
more
than
most
of
rogues
other
offerings
but
was
worth
it
d
very
good
pretty
tasty
but
light
in
body
and
smooth
enough
in
feel
for
it
to
go
down
easy
if
this
were
cheaper
id
buy
it
all
the
time
12
oz
single
from
total
wine
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
was
unsure
of
what
to
expect
of
this
beer
but
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
for
a
whole
evening
drinkability
strong
stomachs
need
only
apply
if
you
got
one
youll
probably
enjoy
it
otherwise
a
touch
too
harsh
for
a
lightweight
like
me
although
i
secretly
did
kinda
enjoy
it
guess
i
enjoy
the
pain
a
wonderful
bouquet
rich
in
malt
hops
and
grains
this
translated
directly
to
the
taste
which
is
initially
bold
on
the
tongue
the
hops
lend
a
delicate
back
taste
that
is
complex
the
body
on
this
is
sublime
allowing
for
the
complexity
of
this
brew
to
shine
through
this
like
all
of
rogues
beers
is
tasty
this
is
a
fine
sippin
beer
that
again
like
all
of
johns
beers
i
will
be
enjoying
again
and
again
drinkability
fab
for
one
but
im
just
not
man
enough
to
have
more
than
one
im
a
big
fan
of
rogue
and
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
drinkability
is
good
its
thinner
mouthfeel
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
nothing
on
this
one
is
played
to
the
extreme
a
very
solid
beer
in
need
of
a
little
tweaking
and
a
freshness
date
pours
transluscent
maroon
with
a
fizzy
beige
head
smell
is
metal
and
tea
scented
malts
taste
is
like
malty
tea
with
some
gooey
sprucey
caramel
kind
of
a
hibiscus
tea
hop
flavor
and
gummy
bear
fruitiness
in
the
finish
with
a
nice
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
nice
carbonation
tastes
better
than
it
smells
but
could
be
an
old
bottle
as
i
picked
it
up
in
vegs
not
bad
and
a
hoppy
amber
for
sure
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
not
the
greatest
example
of
an
amber
ale
a
little
unbalanced
to
the
malty
side
but
still
pretty
decent
pours
out
a
deep
caramelized
hazel
with
a
few
lazy
small
bubbles
making
their
way
to
the
top
of
a
thin
head
that
leaves
some
scattered
lacing
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
reminiscent
of
a
bock
with
toasted
grains
and
a
heavy
raisin
and
date
presence
i
pick
up
a
touch
of
apple
too
flavor
is
a
mix
of
fruity
esters
dark
dried
fruits
chewy
caramel
malts
toffee
honey
bread
and
some
citric
hops
flavor
tends
to
fade
out
a
bit
however
in
the
finish
in
a
seltzery
way
mouthfeel
is
solid
all
around
and
has
a
decent
weight
to
it
the
carbonation
could
be
a
little
more
relaxed
for
my
tastes
good
drinker
all
around
and
a
great
example
of
an
amber
ale
after
a
while
though
id
probably
want
to
switch
to
something
else
if
red
ale
were
all
this
good
i
would
quickly
add
it
to
my
growing
stable
of
favorite
styles
until
thats
the
case
i
can
easily
sate
myself
with
brian
boru
and
rogues
st
rogue
red
its
terrific
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
after
the
first
glass
i
may
pour
out
the
rest
of
my
bottle
so
my
stomach
has
room
for
a
tastier
brew
this
brew
surprised
me
it
pours
a
nice
amber
hue
sparse
cap
but
plenty
of
lacing
smell
is
a
bitter
floral
hop
punch
grass
taste
is
a
hop
punch
which
gets
somewhat
muted
by
a
strong
malt
secondary
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
loved
it
a
drinkable
and
fullflavored
brew
another
quality
offering
from
the
folks
at
newport
oregon
i
would
have
this
again
for
sure
overall
impression
a
highly
balanced
highly
drinkable
amber
ale
probably
the
classic
west
coast
version
of
the
style
recommended
pours
into
my
pint
glass
a
clear
slightly
brown
amber
with
a
thick
foamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
very
hoppy
as
expected
a
bit
of
malty
sweet
tucked
in
the
back
taste
is
initially
very
hoppy
but
fades
and
allows
a
pleasing
light
caramel
malty
flavor
to
peek
through
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
chewy
lighter
in
body
drinkability
is
quite
good
the
high
level
of
aroma
hops
make
this
beer
come
off
initally
like
a
hop
bomb
but
it
seems
more
bark
than
bite
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
would
be
nicer
but
its
still
preety
good
rip
fukutsuru
had
on
tap
once
settled
it
had
a
dark
red
appearance
with
a
thin
head
through
most
of
the
drinking
the
smell
was
of
faint
aromas
of
some
spice
and
citrus
i
liked
the
taste
sweet
and
light
with
the
malt
the
beverage
had
a
medium
body
which
allowed
the
maltycitrus
flavors
to
be
more
enjoyed
than
a
bitterish
rush
to
the
head
overall
pretty
good
review
from
notes
poured
into
my
rogue
pint
glass
copperybrown
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
toasty
malts
on
the
nose
with
a
nice
spicy
and
floral
centennial
hop
aroma
taste
is
very
similar
with
toasty
malt
cut
through
by
hoppiness
although
here
the
hops
take
on
more
citrus
character
theres
also
an
awful
metallic
note
here
that
throws
everything
off
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
but
the
metal
hurts
the
drinkability
d
this
is
an
average
beer
not
totally
bad
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
given
the
other
choices
from
rogue
i
will
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
again
i
really
dig
this
beer
though
its
way
hoppier
than
i
usually
like
my
amber
ales
a
great
rogue
beer
overall
a
good
solid
amber
ale
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
i
found
a
6
pack
i
might
pick
it
up
again
i
probably
wont
run
out
and
buy
another
bomber
immediately
this
is
one
is
hard
to
put
a
label
on
one
half
ipa
and
the
other
half
a
nut
brown
ale
great
compliment
to
dinner
not
my
favorite
but
worth
getting
again
for
something
a
litle
different
drinkability
decent
drinkability
nothing
special
though
d
good
beer
with
an
abv
that
allows
you
to
enjoy
a
brew
with
out
worrying
if
it
will
sneak
up
on
you

centennial
hops
the
taste
is
above
and
beyond
for
the
category
and
even
with
the
modest
5
1
abv
this
brew
packs
quite
a
flavorful
punch
that
is
first
noticed
with
a
clean
clear
distinct
red
aroma
flavor
was
oustanding
slightly
bitter
but
pleasing
with
hops
caramel
slight
vanilla
tastte
really
hit
home
on
this
one
and
rogue
did
well
with
this
particular
sample
creating
an
excellent
depiction
of
the
style
with
a
creamy
rich
and
thick
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
alcohol
was
not
noticed
at
all
and
this
beer
was
dominated
by
oustanding
fresh
flavors
that
really
stood
out
an
awesome
rogue
brew
recommended
ive
had
other
offerings
from
rogue
their
i2pa
imperial
india
ale
is
superb
this
one
just
flat
out
misses
for
me
this
one
falls
way
short
bad
recipe
i
think
im
a
hop
freak
but
there
should
be
some
balance
drinkability
i
dont
know
if
the
old
version
was
dryhopped
or
not
but
i
dont
remember
this
brew
being
this
good
last
time
i
had
it
the
presence
of
the
hops
make
it
a
better
beer
than
just
one
thats
balanced
and
one
that
could
be
a
session
pours
a
clear
amber
that
is
dark
creme
head
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
a
lot
of
piney
hops
perfume
tones
citric
edge
flavor
is
oddly
chalky
in
a
way
i
get
an
aftertaste
of
pecans
or
walnuts
it
takes
some
time
but
it
hits
in
a
wave
and
then
dies
down
unfortunately
after
that
first
hit
there
isnt
really
the
same
level
of
character
but
there
is
a
hearty
bitter
and
earthy
profile
lots
of
complexities
here
but
a
fairly
odd
combination
and
more
earthy
than
anything
a
robust
red
smooth
feel
with
a
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
tone
as
well
easily
drinkable
a
nice
hearty
ale
pours
a
clean
copper
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
piney
and
dry
hops
in
the
taste
sweet
maltiness
and
a
sweet
sweet
dry
hopped
end
a
small
bite
in
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
sweet
malt
and
dry
hopped
aftertaste
a
nice
dry
hop
hoppy
yet
still
malty
smooth
and
balanced
d
pretty
good
drinkability
is
pretty
good
like
this
beer
one
of
the
best
ambers
ive
had
lately
in
my
string
of
amber
tastings
i
love
how
the
dryhopping
helps
bring
a
lot
of
flavor
without
amping
up
the
abv
although
its
best
fresh
i
love
hoppy
beer
and
this
was
no
exception
there
were
hops
present
throughout
the
experience
but
nothing
that
was
overpowering
or
sharp
a
nice
smooth
base
ale
perfectly
accented
with
earthy
flavorful
hops
great
ale
i
cant
really
complain
though
this
was
still
very
drinkable
this
is
an
average
beer
and
one
of
the
weakest
of
the
rogue
line
its
particularly
upsetting
coming
from
such
an
outstanding
brewer
but
then
this
is
a
far
more
approachable
beer
than
some
other
rogue
brews
this
can
appeal
to
a
wider
audience
and
is
a
more
everyday
drinking
brew
than
say
old
crustacean
pours
a
nice
redamber
color
with
a
bit
of
head
and
lacing
excellent
scent
very
hoppy
with
an
excellent
floral
scent
nice
taste
again
very
hoppy
but
almost
too
much
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
detect
much
else
goes
down
fine
but
it
is
a
rather
dry
beer
it
would
not
be
good
at
quenching
a
thirst
not
my
favorite
rogue
at
all
but
its
good
had
this
ontap
though
it
was
called
rogue
dryhopped
red
very
hazy
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
left
walls
of
lacing
all
down
the
glass
so
that
i
couldnt
see
through
the
glass
pretty
astounding
hops
absolutely
dominate
the
smell
there
is
some
caramel
there
but
the
hops
want
you
to
know
that
theyre
in
charge
taste
is
an
unbalanced
showcase
of
hops
though
still
quite
enjoyable
hops
are
both
citrusy
and
piney
which
is
a
wonderful
combination
finish
is
quite
dry
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
though
carbonation
is
adequate
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
twenty
two
ounce
brown
bottle
poured
a
hazy
somewhat
dark
amber
red
color
that
had
beautiful
garnet
highlights
the
beer
was
topped
off
by
a
thick
pillowy
tannish
white
two
finger
head
that
had
great
retention
plenty
of
thick
gobs
of
sticky
lace
were
left
behind
as
the
head
slowly
faded
thick
juicy
hop
aromas
were
most
present
in
the
nose
along
with
some
sweet
crystal
malt
orange
peel
and
some
grapefruit
teamed
up
with
a
bit
of
pine
a
small
underlying
yeast
aroma
was
also
present
not
a
bad
start
a
good
amount
of
flavor
was
packed
into
this
as
well
plenty
of
bittering
hops
out
front
surpisingly
tamed
by
the
big
sweet
malt
more
of
the
citrus
zest
that
was
noted
in
the
nose
and
an
almost
tobacco
like
flavor
in
the
background
i
expected
this
dry
hopped
beer
to
be
quite
a
bit
hoppier
but
was
actually
pretty
balanced
in
my
opinion
not
a
drop
of
noticeable
alcohol
here
plenty
of
carbonation
head
a
somewhat
thick
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
was
very
crisp
and
clean
great
drinkability
another
winner
from
rogue
over
all
very
decent
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
buy
this
again
d
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
has
some
imperfections
but
it
just
does
it
for
me
the
taste
again
is
very
one
dimensional
a
big
dose
of
hops
without
the
malt
profile
to
balance
it
out
i
do
like
hops
so
i
like
the
flavor
but
it
is
far
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
feels
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
hops
make
this
far
from
a
quaffable
beer
to
me
sampler
at
san
francisco
rogue
public
house
dry
hopped
version
i
dont
know
what
the
regular
version
is
like
but
the
dryhopped
is
a
standout
amber
body
and
white
head
extremely
floral
nose
you
can
smell
this
one
from
quite
a
distance
its
one
of
the
most
enticing
aromas
ive
experienced
wonderful
dry
hoppy
taste
bursting
with
citrus
and
berries
echoing
the
perfect
nose
crisp
and
refreshing
palate
great
stuff
creamy
and
smooth
in
texture
with
lower
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
the
mouthfeel
overall
is
bright
but
still
buttery
very
palatable
the
abv
is
modest
so
it
works
as
a
nice
session
brew
and
the
balanced
flavorful
nature
keeps
you
interested
very
well
done
certainly
an
interesting
rendition
of
the
style
d
very
balanced
beer
this
is
how
i
enjoy
my
american
reds
there
is
lots
of
hop
bitterness
but
the
malts
carry
it
so
that
it
is
not
harsh
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
all
night
creamy
head
offwhite
mostly
lasting
head
clear
brown
color
moderately
hoppy
with
flowers
grass
abnd
orange
a
malty
aftertaste
followed
by
some
hoppiness
after
that
a
pretty
good
beer
soft
carbonation
and
dry
texture
i
cant
remember
where
i
had
this
not
much
else
to
say
pretty
good
brew
but
could
use
more
body
and
malt
flavor
to
tie
everything
together
pretty
good
drinkability
despite
what
i
consider
flaws
poured
a
nice
red
amber
color
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
a
nice
looking
beer
taste
is
very
toasty
with
nice
malts
but
really
lacking
in
hop
flavor
i
expected
more
hoppiness
i
would
recommend
brutal
bitter
over
this
one
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
and
no
kick
with
the
alcohol
a
decent
brew
but
not
one
i
will
be
reaching
for
in
the
future
d
cant
say
i
really
like
this
one
at
all
the
flavor
just
isnt
there
if
this
were
better
i
could
see
it
being
a
great
session
beer
because
its
not
too
overpowering
from
a
flavor
or
alcohol
standpoint
doubt
ill
be
drinking
it
again
though
the
body
is
lighter
than
i
expected
but
tastes
of
roasted
malts
and
has
a
grainy
texture
hops
are
slightly
present
but
are
more
earthy
than
anything
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
its
lighter
than
i
expected
but
then
again
its
good
as
a
transition
beer
for
the
novice
ba
drinkability
i
like
it
but
im
a
hophead
very
light
brown
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
thin
sticky
lacing
sweet
smell
hints
of
caramel
good
smooth
taste
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
malty
sweet
enjoyable
earthy
flavor
roasted
malt
palate
with
a
hint
of
hops
lingering
afterward
d
a
good
beer
not
a
great
one
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
one
but
still
drinkable
might
not
have
again
at
the
price
but
a
solid
red
ale
d
pretty
complex
red
ale
with
big
earthy
and
herbal
hops
and
a
bitterness
that
sticks
to
the
tastebuds
this
is
a
hopped
up
version
of
a
red
ale
thats
not
my
favorite
rogue
offering
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
got
a
bomber
of
some
st
rogue
here
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
has
a
really
beautiful
look
to
it
nice
frothy
head
that
has
some
lacing
smell
is
good
too
smells
like
carmal
and
malt
with
some
mild
hop
scents
as
well
i
almost
detect
like
a
cinnamon
apple
scent
too
lots
of
different
flavors
in
the
nose
on
this
one
taste
is
good
but
not
as
complex
as
the
smell
first
has
a
bitterness
to
it
then
finished
with
a
smoother
malty
taste
for
being
dry
hopped
the
hops
really
dont
come
out
to
me
as
much
as
other
dry
hopped
beers
that
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
decent
not
a
great
beer
but
better
than
your
average
beer
bought
a
bomber
of
this
from
the
portland
brewup
and
split
it
with
my
good
friend
kboett77
allinall
a
pretty
good
session
beer
with
a
higher
hop
content
i
gave
it
straight
4s
because
its
better
than
average
although
not
exceptional
pours
a
clear
luscious
red
with
a
white
head
good
retention
and
carbonation
a
bit
of
bite
on
the
tongue
from
the
fizz
and
the
hops
good
malty
center
with
a
steppedup
hop
content
the
hops
are
citrusy
and
bitter
great
for
someone
who
is
a
hophead
and
likes
a
good
red
ale
ill
probably
return
to
this
one
in
the
future
pours
dark
brown
with
a
big
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
big
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
dry
hopped
after
all
dark
sweetness
taste
is
balanced
between
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
citrusy
hops
residual
sweetness
with
fruit
notes
not
very
bitter
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
nice
overall
amber
ale
the
dry
hops
work
surprisingly
well
in
this
beer
d
its
better
than
some
amber
ales
but
far
from
the
best
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
thick
off
white
head
nice
lacing
settles
to
a
thick
layer
smell
is
sweet
caramel
light
pine
and
floral
hops
touch
of
citrus
bit
of
tea
bready
nice
aroma
taste
is
caramel
piney
hops
floral
tea
malty
bread
middle
nice
balanced
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
nice
beer
to
session
with
goes
down
easy
thanks
for
picking
up
lexx
great
mouthfeel
finish
coats
the
tongue
next
sip
gives
it
a
fresh
start
highly
drinkable
i
made
a
night
out
of
most
of
the
6pack
and
saved
this
one
for
reviewing
as
usual
another
strong
offering
from
rogue
i
think
this
is
one
of
their
better
sessionish
beers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
but
doesnt
get
in
the
way
finishes
with
a
slightly
slick
feeling
on
the
palate
the
brew
also
has
a
very
clean
finish
this
is
a
brew
id
not
be
opposed
to
buying
again
in
fact
it
is
a
very
nice
american
red
though
ive
not
had
all
that
many
of
this
style
id
have
to
say
that
this
one
goes
down
as
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
santas
private
reserve
from
rogue
was
also
great
being
a
hop
head
i
really
like
the
grassy
and
floral
hops
from
the
dry
hopping
as
well
as
the
balance
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
the
only
qualm
ive
with
this
brew
is
its
mouthfeel
just
a
bit
more
body
and
id
be
sold
i
didnt
get
a
chance
to
try
the
regular
st
rogue
red
but
im
guess
i
missed
out
because
i
am
sure
this
beer
would
be
good
even
without
the
dry
hopped
bitterness
and
aroma
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
ill
be
buying
more
i
expected
more
hops
in
this
one
to
me
the
caramel
presence
was
stronger
d
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
hops
this
is
surely
one
to
try
i
found
it
to
be
very
satisfying
and
close
to
the
top
of
its
class
for
the
style
i
would
suggest
trying
a
bomber
if
youve
never
had
it
or
revisiting
it
if
you
have
light
bodied
overcarbonated
and
astringent
in
the
end
abv
seems
pretty
low
low
enough
for
this
to
be
sessionable
i
wouldnt
sit
through
more
than
about
three
of
these
though
i
am
on
the
fence
whether
or
not
to
recommend
this
one
ill
jump
off
the
fence
and
say
pass
on
this
one
decent
stuff
but
it
didnt
deliver
what
the
looks
and
smell
promised
overall
an
interesting
amber
ale
with
plenty
more
hop
flavors
to
it
than
other
examples
my
only
complaint
is
about
the
way
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
weave
together
that
well
at
first
same
copper
color
tan
head
with
largish
bubbles
on
top
tighter
foam
below
aromas
much
hoppier
these
are
less
floral
and
more
citric
than
before
the
flavor
is
well
attenuated
and
quite
bitter
for
style
putting
the
hops
right
on
display
the
mouthfeel
is
full
even
with
the
high
carbonation
i
almost
never
get
six
packs
but
i
did
for
a
party
not
long
ago
and
i
drank
all
of
them
without
sharing
i
love
the
new
st
rogue
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
scores
have
all
been
upped
a
point
drinkability
up
a
half
could
drink
an
average
amount
of
this
kind
of
heavy
and
high
in
alcohol
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
ruby
color
the
head
is
small
and
reddishpink
lacing
is
decent
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
grapefruit
tangerine
and
just
a
whif
of
cocoa
the
taste
leans
a
little
towards
the
sweet
side
but
is
fairly
balanced
it
is
of
caramel
with
grapefruit
in
the
background
and
a
touch
of
pine
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
its
not
very
often
you
see
a
label
on
a
brew
noting
dry
hopped
for
a
red
ale
unless
yah
brewing
yourself
and
you
do
this
action
to
increase
that
hop
aroma
well
after
having
a
taste
of
this
brew
i
just
did
not
get
any
good
emotion
there
was
plenty
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
so
be
aware
ok
theres
a
smidgen
of
hop
scent
at
first
sniff
ok
so
thats
a
good
thing
not
sure
if
its
the
chinook
centennial
or
both
in
the
batch
during
the
dry
hop
anyway
i
do
not
want
to
be
long
in
text
and
drag
this
out
rouge
makes
better
beer
than
this
i
need
this
on
draft
to
compare
the
two

bottom
line
it
was
just
ok
dont
get
me
wrong
maybe
i
got
a
sub
par
batch
or
maybe
there
was
an
elapsed
shelf
life
a
little
bitter
in
the
mouth
after
having
a
sip
or
two

like
an
esb
which
i
would
have
preferred
vs
a
red
but
just
not
the
malthop
mix
taste
that
i
was
looking
for
in
a
brew
ill
look
for
another
tasting
opportunity
if
i
can
find
it
on
draft
jc
d
i
originally
really
liked
this
based
upon
the
smell
but
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
beer
i
enjoyed
it
less
and
less
i
wish
this
wasnt
the
case
d
this
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
is
a
decent
brew
but
something
about
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
so
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
few
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
other
than
the
price
i
find
it
highly
drinkable
as
the
flavor
is
nice
but
a
bit
simple
but
if
looking
for
a
red
ale
i
think
i
will
have
to
go
for
a
red
rocket
ill
probably
try
this
from
bottles
now
this
just
became
my
favorite
rogue
beer
good
accomplishment
with
the
many
good
beers
they
have
thanks
for
the
bottle
leftmindedrighty
another
great
beer
from
rogue
give
it
a
try
btw
abv
is
6
2
dthis
is
like
an
imperial
red
sort
of
thing
the
fresh
hops
are
really
nice
i
just
wish
they
factored
more
into
the
smell
the
flavor
was
or
roasted
malts
and
semi
sweet
caramel
and
candied
spices
this
is
the
best
red
ale
that
ive
tasted
ever
another
winner
from
rogue
ales
d
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
and
one
thatll
find
its
way
into
my
rotation
fairly
regularly
its
hoppy
enough
to
make
a
hophead
happy
while
providing
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
an
ipa
d
i
was
really
pleased
to
find
this
at
a
restaurant
because
ive
never
been
able
to
pick
up
a
single
bottle
of
it
this
is
a
really
good
amber
one
of
the
hoppiest
ive
ever
had
picked
up
a
couple
singles
of
this
from
premier
gourmet
in
buffalo
poured
a
dark
copperish
red
with
a
nice
1
finger
tan
head
smell
was
malty
with
a
caramel
linger
initial
taste
was
sweet
malt
with
a
nice
citrus
splash
and
followed
up
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitter
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
clean
but
nothing
extraordinary
carbination
was
a
little
more
than
i
prefer
overall
a
pretty
solid
red
with
great
drinkability

abv
while
this
beer
is
not
one
i
would
consider
a
favorite
it
was
a
very
good
beer
i
would
order
it
out
sometime
but
it
isnt
one
i
could
have
more
then
once
a
sitting
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
ive
never
had
the
regular
version
but
i
think
its
likely
that
the
dry
hopping
is
an
improvement
pours
a
dark
amber
tone
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
and
retains
itself
nicely
aroma
consists
of
citrus
hops
and
a
little
malty
sweetness
as
well
taste
begins
with
a
pleasant
yet
shortlived
toasted
malt
flavor
that
gives
way
to
a
generous
but
not
overwhelming
citrus
hop
flavor
finish
is
somewhat
dry
with
a
lingering
hop
aftertaste
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
makes
this
brew
easy
on
the
palate
and
quite
drinkable
a
6er
of
this
wont
last
long
in
my
fridge
enjoy
drinkability
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
good
for
the
hop
fanatics
too
although
there
are
far
more
hoppy
beers
out
there
recommended
drinkability
awesome
stuff
for
the
hop
lover
a
fantastic
session
red
deep
red
pour
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
nice
mouthfeel
very
tasty
a
bit
of
citrusfruit
taste
at
the
end
good
stuff
excellent
effort
by
the
people
at
rogue
i
would
definitely
have
again
and
i
would
recommend
to
everyone
out
there
that
hasnt
experienced
this
beer
i
had
this
alongside
the
dryhopped
version
i
have
to
say
that
the
dryhopped
version
had
a
taste
that
this
one
just
didnt
reach
stillinall
a
good
brew
with
a
heavy
malt
character
drinkability
id
like
to
know
what
the
abv
is
on
this
one
id
definitely
reach
for
it
again
more
like
to
see
it
around
these
parts
than
the
two
i
previously
mentioned
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
really
would
be
a
good
session
beer
for
those
who
like
a
lot
of
hops
but
want
to
drink
a
few
more
beers
than
a
typical
ipa
would
allow
notesthe
flavor
profile
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
well
made
as
are
all
of
the
rogue
brews
ive
tried
just
not
to
my
tastes
12

medium

with

with
i
twinge
of
hops
on
the
back
end
medium
bodied
with
mild
bitter
after
taste
even
with
the
medium
weight
very
drinkable
and
wish
i
had
more
on
hand
very
drinkable
but
the
bitterness
may
shy
some
away
from
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
especially
if
theyre
expecting
a
smithwicks
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
refreshing
enjoyable
beer
really
enjoyed
this
beer
only
got
better
as
it
warmed
and
more
of
the
flavors
stood
out
will
be
looking
to
have
it
again
overall
it
was
a
nice
session
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
kick
its
like
the
dried
hops
cut
back
the
overall
flavor
and
balance
of
the
beer
it
was
a
good
beer
and
gorgeous
to
look
at
its
definitely
worth
trying
but
i
dont
see
myself
running
to
the
store
to
get
more
not
my
cup
o
tea
im
not
the
most
seasoned
of
beer
experts
but
im
also
not
a
rookie
i
really
like
this
one
give
it
a
try
one
of
my
personal
favorites
very
drinkable
a
most
refreshing
brew
that
pleases
the
senses
but
does
not
assault
them
this
red
ale
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
smooth
lightly
carbonated
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
i
could
easily
pop
another
one
of
these
when
this
one
is
done
and
then
perhaps
another
i
dont
like
this
one
enough
to
session
it
but
if
the
flavor
had
been
what
the
smell
was
then
this
would
be
a
top
100
beer
22

the

are
both
good
it
smells
like

citrus

caramel
and
toasted

at
first
it
tastes
like
toasted
malt
and
caramel
then
has
a
nice
hoppy
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
id
like
in
this
style
of
beer
even
then
the
drinkability
is
still
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
well
balanced
with
good
flavor
i
could
drink
this
as
an
occasional
session
beer
id
recommend
it
to
others
to
try
i
like

the

on

of

fairly

finish
overall
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
an
american
amber
wellworth
revisiting
i
am
not
a
large
drinker
of
reds
but
this
is
the
best
i
have
tasted
would
have
given
it
5s
had
rogue
not
had
so
many
other
solid
brews
rogue
is
always
an
interesting
experience
but
somewhat
disappointing
at
times
overall
an
absolute
hop
bomb
recommended
for
anyone
whos
looking
for
a
fix
poured
a
deep
dark
amber
with
a
nice
one
inch
off
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lace
nice
retention
on
the
head
as
well
smell
was
deeply
hopped
with
a
nice
pine
resin
aroma
and
a
hint
of
light
grain
my
first
impression
was
a
bit
light
in
the
carbonation
and
a
slight
slickness
or
oilyness
to
it
big
hop
profile
was
very
nicely
balanced
against
the
malted
grain
back
overall
this
was
an
easily
sessionable
and
highly
enjoyable
brew
score
another
winner
for
the
guys
over
at
rogue
at
first
i
kinda
liked
this
it
looked
cool
but
as
i
dug
into
it
i
didnt
find
it
very
special
it
somewhat
bored
me
i
could
drink
a
lot
but
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
water
too
nice
and
thick
a
real
ale
but
yet
its
so
smooth
no
bitter
bite
at
the
end
this
ones
a
keeper
deep
dark
delicious
overall
an
excellent
beer
maybe
two
at
the
most
to
truly
enjoy
it
in
one
sitting
a
pretty
cool
red
ale
oddly
i
found
the
hops
best
came
through
while
the
beer
was
still
chilled
so
dont
let
it
warm
up
too
much
the
malt
profile
was
a
nice
mix
of
cream
and
caramel
that
got
backed
up
by
crisp
citrus
hops
the
hops
flavor
wasnt
overwhelming
but
there
was
enough
bitterness
to
put
this
red
ale
on
par
with
some
ipas
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
high
not
sure
of
the
abv
but
it
seems
sessionable
i
had
this
on
tap
at
yardhouse
in
costa
mesa
ca
the
color
was
a
nice
deep
red
the
head
was
nice
and
left
thick
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
taste
was
really
really
great
i
could
easily
have
had
several
of
these
i
am
going
back
for
more
asap
this
is
good
stuff
but
i
want
the
same
kind
that
i
had
from
the
philly
craft
beer
fest
drinkability
red
ales
dont
always
knock
you
out
but
a
good
one
like
this
makes
a
nice
session
brew
poured
a
dark
amberred
roasty
caramelly
bready
piney
bouqet
this
amber
has
much
more
piney
hop
presence
than
most
amberred
ales
taste
is
dominated
by
the
hops
no
residual
sugars
from
the
malts
to
detect
upfront
although
there
is
a
significant
dry
roasty
malt
presence
the
back
end
and
finish
are
dominated
by
the
hop
astringency
making
this
amberred
more
different
than
most
a
tealike
astringency
closes
it
out
mouthfeel
is
almost
medium
for
my
taste
i
would
like
a
little
more
balance
towards
the
malt
end
of
the
sprectrum
for
this
style
but
i
do
love
the
ibus
in
this
beer
drinkability
great
look
great
smell
great
taste
great
beer
its
as
simple
as
that
very
nice
hop
prescence
awesome
lacing
the
lists
go
on
this
was
a
really
solid
offering
finishes
nice
and
dry
with
a
sweet
balance
of
malty
goodness
and
dry
hopped
bite
really
nice
my
only
concern
is
that
i
could
see
myself
growing
tired
of
this
and
looking
for
something
a
litle
more
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
medium
bodied
and
even
though
the
hops
leave
some
dryness
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
at
the
end
to
balance
i
could
go
through
quite
a
few
of
these
and
stay
interested
drinkability
very
sippable
there
is
a
little
bitterness
but
it
is
not
much
of
a
detract
an
overall
goodborderline
great
rogue
offering
overall
impression
solid
drinkable
beer
nice
malty
flavor
both
good
but
i
prefer
the
dry
hopped
version
i
goo
beer
to
be
sure
very
similar
to
the
dty
hopped
version
with
less
hopsof
course
pours
a
dark
amber
looks
nice
in
the
glass
with
a
medium
sized
head
i
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
bubt
some
hop
and
some
sweetness
in
there
the
flavor
was
also
slightly
hoppy
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
and
certainly
some
sweet
almost
citrus
flavors
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
the
dry
hopped
version
but
that
character
is
still
there
its
a
very
smooth
beer
my
22
oz
seemed
to
just
dissapear
on
me
a
good
red
ale
one
i
would
get
again
actually
i
was
quite
surpised
by
this
beer
usually
rogues
nonstout
nonceramicbottled
ales
are
always
above
average
but
never
blow
me
out
of
the
water
this
one
didnt
exactly
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
was
solid
as
anything
and
something
i
would
most
certainly
have
again
taste
is
upfront
is
of
sweet
and
biscuity
malt
giving
way
to
some
grapefruit
and
spicy
hops
along
with
a
little
fruit
pressence
i
think
there
is
pretty
decent
balance
here
maybe
leaning
a
little
towards
the
hops
side
but
not
overwelming
mouthfeel
is
probably
a
tad
more
thin
than
one
would
want
but
its
not
too
bad
and
the
carbonation
is
at
a
nice
level
a
very
drinkable
red
and
definitely
one
of
the
better
that
i
have
had
another
solid
effort
from
the
folks
at
rogue
very
interesting
however
drinkability
is
good
a
solid
red
ale
about
on
par
for
rouge
d
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
is
very
balanced
and
refreshing
it
is
a
great
red
ale
and
actually
reminds
me
of
an
irish
ale
st
rogue
red
is
very
sessionable
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
dry
hopped
version
d
very
interesting
brew
and
one
i
would
purchase
again
rogue
is
always
surprising
me
with
their
styles
and
this
is
no
different
good
change
of
pace
beer
a
thoughtful
brew
but
nothing
you
need
to
put
much
thought
into
overall
a
very
nice
little
beer
from
rogue
very
interesting
stuff
though
drinkability
pretty
good
i
really
enjoyed
how
pleasantly
different
this
beer
was
from
what
i
expected
although
i
didnt
get
to
enjoy
with
a
100
steak
dry
hopped
st
rogue
red
isnt
quite
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
pictured
a
solid
red
ale
with
a
good
hop
kick
unfortuanately
the
bitterness
i
was
expecting
just
wasnt
there
still
an
enjoyable
and
extremely
sessionable
beer
d
one
hoppy
amber
ale
hops
almost
take
too
much
away
from
the
malt
profile
but
if
you
like
em
hoppy
youll
love
this
one
a
nice
offering
from
rogue
d
it
goes
down
well
enough
i
mean
theres
nothing
particularly
disagreeable
about
it
but
its
just
not
very
inspired
less
hoppymore
malt
balanced
than
other
rogues
ive
had
which
i
am
a
fan
of
earthy
unfortunately
this
beer
also
does
not
share
some
of
the
good
characteristics
of
many
of
its
brethren
being
not
as
substantive
imo
feels
a
bit
thin
and
lacks
the
complexity
i
tend
to
expect
from
them
or
a
solid
red
ale
too
much
fizz
gets
better
as
it
goes
on
so
would
get
it
again
if
the
mood
struck
man
what
an
absolute
disappointment
i
bought
this
22
oz
bomber
at
5
49
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
the
dry
hopping
is
evident
but
the
taste
is
nonexistent
tastes
more
like
a
macrobrewed
ipa
with
no
maltiness
whatsoever
a
big
thumbs
down
for
this
rogue
ale
pours
a
pretty
deep
red
color
with
orange
highlights
topped
by
an
inch
of
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
of
sharp
floral
hops
mildly
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
slight
metallic
tinge
palate
is
mostly
floral
hops
up
front
developing
a
more
fruity
edge
towards
the
swallow
some
fairly
sweet
caramel
malt
balances
out
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
body
is
smooth
but
a
bit
foamy
at
times
a
tasty
beer
definitely
fit
for
a
session
or
two
and
a
considerable
step
up
from
the
regular
st
rogue
red
poured
appropriately
into
a
rogue
pint
glass
a
crisp
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
diminished
quickly
to
a
ring
with
a
few
bubble
clusters
in
the
middle
aroma
was
a
good
blend
of
rich
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hops
just
a
tad
on
the
weak
side
however
taste
was
a
wonderful
balance
of
malts
and
hops
deep
caramel
flavor
in
great
harmony
with
pleasant
piney
hops
there
is
a
greatly
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
original
st
rogue
red
had
always
been
my
least
favorite
rogue
beer
available
in
six
packs
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
a
vast
improvement
and
makes
it
one
of
my
favorite
rogues
d
i
got
to
be
honest
here
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
i
wont
call
it
a
let
down
butok
i
will
call
it
a
let
down
this
could
have
been
so
much
better
imo
especially
from
a
brewery
like
rogue
i
guess
i
just
found
it
a
bit
boring
what
i
like
about
this
offering
is
the
strong
malt
backbone
that
other
rogue
beers
lack
the
house
yeast
flavour
is
there
but
a
definite
maltiness
dominates
the
beer
i
see
this
as
a
food
friendly
amber
that
has
a
definite
west
coast
big
mouthfeel
nicely
crafted
pours
a
gorgeous
deep
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
bit
of
beige
head
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
retention
or
lacing
smell
is
feint
hops
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
not
a
powerful
but
a
pleasant
nose
taste
is
mild
malt
sweetness
up
front
then
giving
way
to
a
hoppy
bitterness
a
bit
of
fruit
and
a
hint
of
spice
finishes
dry
and
bitter
not
a
bad
red
ale
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
will
satisfy
many
tastes
quite
impressive
certainly
would
go
with
a
lot
of
food
and
be
a
nice
session

more

might
be
a

much
i
usually
enjoy
red
ales
and
st
rogue
is
certainly
no
exception
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
complex
and
fresh
hop
flavors
with
a
support
from
the
malt
hints
but
the
bitterness
was
a
bit
of
a
punch
in
the
face
good
mouthfeel
drinkable

this
one
is
a
sipper
st

a
dark

color
with
a
tan

from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
it
has
a
nice
aroma
the
hops
are
very
noticeable
as
i
would
expect
but
theres
also
a
sweet
maltiness
too
as
well
as
a
some

quite
active

maltier
than
i
expected
with

contrast

not

from

not
that
its
necessarily
a
bad
thing
this

dry

st
rogue
red
is
highly
drinkable
a
red
ale
that
borders
on
an
ipa
with
plenty
of
big
juicy
hops
that
have
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
makes
the
mouth
want
more
though
the
hops
are
the
star
of
the
show
the
malts
hold
things
together
with
a
subtle
caramelfruity
sweetness
balancing
out
the
ale
a
really
nice
amberred
ale
and
one
i
will
definitely
buy
again
very
flavorful
but
also
very
sessionable
anothe
fine
product
from
the
folks
at
rogue
highly
recommended
seek
and
enjoy
d
have
had
this
one
before
very
tasty
brew
well
balanced
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
creamy
yellowish
head
balanced
aroma
of
caramel
and
hops
very
rogue
you
know
what
i
mean
sweetened
textured
malty
flavor
well
balanced
with
fruity
hops
and
an
earthy
spuce
touch
medium
bodied
and
slick
at
first
but
a
solid
bitterness
drys
things
out
to
finish
it
off
pretty
soft
in
the
mouth
its
a
good
amber
i
have
no
real
complaints
sessionworthy
for
sure
d
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
i
would
recommend
this
d
enjoyable
interesting
take
on
an
amber
but
not
all
to
desirable
worth
a
shot
though
it
has
good
qualities
drinkability
probably
wont
drink
again
not
impressed
d
the
smell
is
kind
of
strong
and
kills
the
taste
it
is
good
just
i
think
i
would
prefer
the
undry
hopped
version
i
was
excited
when
i
found
this
at
my
local
beer
store
so
i
bought
a
bomber
and
brought
it
home
and
opened
it
tonight
after
a
while
in
the
ice
box
pours
a
nice
deep
rich
redorange
amber
color
theres
a
thin
inch
head
which
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
along
the
glass
smells
hoppy
for
sure
but
i
have
difficulty
discerning
much
else
in
the
aroma
some
pine
as
a
result
of
the
hops
and
maybe
some
orange
peel
it
has
a
pleasant
flavor
but
not
necessarily
what
i
was
expecting
very
hoppy
with
some
mild
sweetness
that
kicks
in
at
the
end
but
i
expected
more
complexity
for
some
reason
this
is
good
but
a
bit
pedestrian
in
the
least
i
was
expecting
more
malt
balance
being
an
amber
ale
but
still
its
nice
sort
of
like
a
red
ipa
decent
mouthfeel
as
well
overall
i
like
this
beer
because
i
like
hoppy
ales
but
im
not
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
it
down
still
a
solid
effort
by
rogue
enjoyable
drinkability
at
best
a
fairly
average
textbook
amber
ale
a
must
try
not
your
average
over
produced
beer
not
a
demanding
beer
by
any
means
nor
particulary
compelling
however
one
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
without
realizing
it
mouthfeel
is
ok
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
that
would
make
for
a
decent
session
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
ive
got
a
few
more
rogues
on
the
agenda
for
this
evening
not
an
amazing
brew
especially
being
from
such
a
hyped
brewery
but
still
one
thats
pretty
good
the
mouth
is
medium
bodied
showing
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
the
drinkability
is
average
as
it
gets
a
little
too
sweet
without
much
other
complex
flavors
to
undercut
it
not
badi
would
never
dump
on
out
but
rogue
has
done
much
better
bottom
line
another
tasty
brew
from
rogue
that
i
can
recommend
overall
an
excellent
amber
ale
strongly
recommended
overall
even
when
i
wasnt
living
in
oregon
i
relished
to
acquire
22oz
bottles
of
rogue
since
living
here
i
usually
get
around
to
a
bottle
of
st
rogues
every
few
months
good
stuff
above
average
example
of
the
style
would
pair
nicely
with
a
piece
of
smoked
salmon
another
above
average
beer
from
a
great
brewery
pick
it
up
and
enjoy
it
with
a
nice
meal
d
not
necessarily
something
id
keep
stocked
regularly
but
definitely
something
to
grab
at
a
bar
and
nothing
id
ever
turn
down
if
offered
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
an
american
amberred
style
quite
tasty
this
beer
poured
a
deep
amberred
color
with
a
tan
thick
and
persistent
head
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
heavy
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
that
is
balanced
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
too
chewy
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
id
love
to
drink
often
appearence
a
tarnished
amber
colour
rising
head
that
stayed
the
sitting
considerable
hoppiness
but
quite
well
refined
a
harmonious
medley
of
hops
which
constitutes
the
heart
of
this
beer
hops
fullbodied
with
plenty
of
flavour
but
escape
without
being
all
that
bitter
aggresive
but
highly
drinkable
a
well
structured
flavour
with
a
clean
finish
this
beer
has
quite
a
pompus
character
to
it
i
enjoyed
this
far
more
than
i
expected
served
from
the
tap
into
a
pint
glass
this
was
one
of
those
redamber
ales
that
is
translated
into
the
more
bitterhoppy
type
rather
than
one
that
focuses
a
little
more
on
sweet
hops
and
big
surprise
it
comes
from
oregon
the
st
rogue
red
really
does
contain
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
for
an
amber
and
how
you
review
it
basically
depends
on
what
you
were
expecting
or
what
you
normally
look
for
in
an
amber
ale
thankfully
ive
had
both
ends
of
the
amberred
ale
spectrum
and
i
honestly
prefer
those
that
contain
more
proportions
of
malt
and
caramel
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
though
its
just
more
of
a
full
bodied
dark
pale
ale
i
got
this
stuff
by
accident
but
anyway
it
pours
pretty
darkly
with
a
weak
tan
head
it
smells
pretty
hoppy
with
some
malt
its
flavor
is
all
hop
and
very
little
malt
at
all
yes
i
would
like
some
beer
with
my
hops
thank
you
the
color
is
kind
of
a
strange
rust
that
would
also
lead
you
to
expect
malt
its
good
just
not
worth
the
price
rogue
is
asking
for
it
ive
bitten
into
a
hop
before
and
it
doesnt
taste
unlike
this
i
bet
if
i
aged
this
stuff
for
a
year
or
two
it
would
mellow
out
a
bit
the
drinkibility
is
what
puts
this
over
the
top
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
night
no
matter
the
season
or
time
of
day
my
first
perfect
5
poured
to
a
brownishorange
with
medium
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
was
not
real
strong
but
what
was
there
was
mostly
floral
and
grassy
hops
at
the
beginning
but
by
midglass
became
more
of
a
malty
nut
smell
flavor
was
likewise
although
the
floral
hops
tended
to
be
the
most
dominant
throughout
the
entire
glass
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
another
good
offering
by
rogue
overall
a
very
fine
red
ale
that
can
stand
with
the
best
of
them
definitely
has
the
rogue
touch
to
the
style
and
while
some
rogue
brews
are
taken
a
bit
too
far
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
done
almost
to
perfection
an
excellent
brew
that
is
definitely
recommended
drinkability
is
decent
chillhazed
burnt
orange
with
a
rocky
and
pockmarked
khaki
head
gigantic
pine
and
citrus
hop
aromas
from
the
dryhopping
although
ive
not
yet
sampled
the
regular
st
rogue
red
for
comparison
bitter
grapefruit
pith
and
bergamot
flavors
dance
around
the
tongue
up
front
then
a
bready
malt
structure
makes
its
presence
known
until
a
piney
bitterness
returns
to
puncture
the
palate
at
the
end
citrusy
spruce
burps
but
nothing
nostrilstinging
chewy
mouthfeel
medium
body
but
undercarbonated
most
likely
from
the
growler
not
being
sealed
tightly
enough
right
away
delicious
beer
all
around
a
super
sessionable
red
ale
thats
almost
worth
the
slightly
high
price

a
12gallon
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
some
time
and
i
got
my
growler
filled
today
at
consumers
poured
a
slight
hazed
light
amber
with
a
tight
well
formed
12
finger
head
that
left
a
ring
of
lace
as
it
settled
ah
man
the
aromas
of
this
beer
would
make
any
hophead
speak
in
tongues
at
first
smelli
popped
open
the
growler
to
fresh
squeezed
grapefruit
and
damp
pine
needles
with
underlying
freshly
mown
grass
just
beautiful
and
to
me
pretty
much
perfect
the
fresh
hop
flavors
just
abound
here
really
wake
up
the
taste
buds
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
malt
base
there
and
it
holds
up
ok
until
the
finish
when
the
big
dose
of
fresh
citrusypiney
and
extremely
resiny
hop
comes
crashing
thru
burping
fresh
tasting
hop
is
a
treatby
far
my
new
favorite
red
its
so
good
i
might
finish
off
the
growler
todayouch
overall
this
beer
is
weak
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
large
tanned
head
with
a
deep
copperamber
with
slight
chill
haze
a
bit
of
grassyherbal
hops
toasted
and
or
smoked
malts
carmel
and
that
somes
up
the
aroma
the
taste
is
bitter
throughout
there
is
a
astringent
metallic
taste
that
creeps
into
the
aftertaste
bitterness
there
is
carmel
to
add
to
the
balance
but
this
brew
is
not
well
balanced
and
the
hops
take
over
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
with
a
suprisingly
light
body
i
would
say
that
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
it
is
not
their
best
dfor
some
reason
this
one
doesnt
wear
well
for
me
by
the
time
i
was
onto
a
2nd
one
i
lost
interest
i
guess
it
is
a
but
onedimensional
dits
good
and
possibly
a
good
session
choice
d
a
nice
quaffer
from
rogue
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
12
oz
pint
from
notes
this
beer
arrived
a
solid
amber
color
with
a
small
half
finger
of
head
clarity
was
very
good
with
small
bubbles
periodically
working
towards
the
head
that
head
maintained
well
into
the
beer
the
nose
on
this
beer
was
awesome
it
had
a
very
solid
foundation
of
caramel
malt
but
the
hop
that
followed
was
awesome
if
there
were
ever
candied
hops
they
would
smell
like
this
beer
sweet
and
citrusy
there
was
a
light
toasted
breadyness
but
the
hops
are
what
define
this
one
flavor
initially
brought
caramel
and
melanoidans
but
moved
very
quickly
to
solid
and
chunky
citrusy
hop
flavor
it
finished
with
a
mild
but
very
pleasing
bitterness
with
sweet
grapefruity
hop
and
mild
caramel
malty
sweetness
very
very
tasty
beer
here
the
feel
was
moderate
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
really
added
to
the
experience
this
was
an
excellent
beer
with
bold
flavors
that
knew
exactly
when
to
stop
short
of
being
too
much
the
bitter
lingered
just
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
draining
the
pint
in
record
time
this
one
blew
my
mind
dvery
drinkable
deep
amber
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
pine
sweet
malt
spent
hops
and
a
bit
of
sour
citrus
fruit
lots
of
caramel
malt
flavor
along
with
some
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
of
roasty
chocolate
on
the
finish
fairly
creamy
body
with
a
solid
bitter
finish
overall
the
aroma
wasnt
as
good
as
i
had
expected
the
spent
hop
note
really
put
me
off
but
drinking
the
beer
itself
was
quite
nice
d
highly
drinkable
full
of
flavor
yet
not
overwhelming
looking
forward
to
trying
the
dryhopped
kegs
this
is
a
much
more
subtle
brew
that
i
expected
from
rogue
but
i
still
found
it
very
enjoyable
great
on
a
hot
day
like
today
i
probably
would
not
seek
this
out
though
hrmm
this
one
is
a
mixed
bag
this
is
definitely
a
quality
brew
but
the
combination
of
caramel
pine
and
excessive
grain
husk
leaves
me
not
wanting
to
drink
another
this
is
a
very
rich
brew
for
my
tastes
definitely
worth
a
try
for
those
interested
in
reds
as
its
quite
unique
hmmmm
ive
got
it
this
brew
tastes
like
arrogant
bastard
light
and
thats
a
good
thing
since
sab
is
on
my
short
list
its
not
as
pretty
as
the
bastard
and
not
as
assertive
in
the
nose
or
palate
but
its
definately
in
the
ballpark
add
in
the
fact
that
at
5
1
its
available
in
wv
this
is
one
worth
coming
back
to
a
lot
going
on
and
not
all
blends
well
would
never
turn
it
down
just
tough
against
the
standards
this
brewery
has
set
bitterness
not
balanced
that
well
poured
a
nice
dark
copper
color
a
bit
of
a
head
and
pretty
much
no
lacing
that
may
have
just
been
the
tap
system
i
noticed
that
most
of
the
beers
poured
that
night
were
like
that
it
had
good
carbonation
though
the
taste
struck
me
a
mainstream
while
good
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
it
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
but
certainly
not
on
my
top
3
favorite
rogue
list
picked
this
up
as
a
last
bottle
to
complete
a
sixer
was
not
too
sure
about
this
choice
but
was
plesantly
surprised
pours
an
amber
red
color
with
a
small
head
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
hops
perhaps
a
little
brown
sugar
taste
is
heavy
on
the
brown
sugar
citrus
fruits
apple
and
hops
very
balanced
however
with
no
one
flavor
being
too
overpowering
nice
mild
bitter
hop
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
very
tasty
brew
with
a
complex
taste
not
too
overpowering
but
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
guessing
would
buy
again
but
definitely
not
the
top
amber
ale
out
there
cheers
taste
natural
zesty
hops
mixes
well
with
amber
malts
roasted
to
perfection
the
northwestern
hops
offers
some
citrus
notes
to
meld
with
the
malts
in
this
red
brew
taste
was
surprising
immediately
i
noticed
the
hops
which
were
very
tasty
there
is
also
a
pretty
decent
malt
presence
as
well
not
in
perfect
balance
but
still
tasty
overall
a
really
good
beer
came
in
a
pint
glass
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
12
off
white
head
that
retained
well
smell
was
sweet
malts
this
was
strange
but
still
pleasant
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
hoppy
aroma
taste
intitially
was
caramel
but
the
hops
quickly
dominate
piny
and
grassy
hops
with
a
nice
hop
finish
very
drinkable
session
brew
nothing
overly
exciting
but
good
none
the
less
overall
id
say
this
is
a
decent
beer
id
try
it
again
esspecialy
to
see
if
the
low
carbonation
and
watery
sensation
i
picked
up
was
just
from
my
bottle
pours
a
dark
garnet
red
with
a
finger
or
two
of
khaki
head
nose
is
a
mix
of
fruity
hops
and
vanillabready
malts
taste
starts
off
with
a
citrushop
bitterness
that
is
evenedout
with
the
vanillacaramelbready
malts
mouthfeel
is
creamysmooth
and
lightly
carbonated
on
the
rich
side
for
an
amber
ale
but
plenty
of
flavor
in
there
to
keep
you
interested
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
drinkability
exactly
what
a
red
ale
should
be
flavorful
yet
relaxing
and
extremely
drinkable
served
in
a
pint
glass
and
out
of
the
fridge
for
about
30
minutes
poured
wiith
a
nice
browntinted
head
nice
brownishred
color
and
good
head
retention
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
citrusy
smell
of
hops
very
nice
citrusy
taste
coming
from
the
hops
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
to
follow
nice
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
this
is
drinkable
to
begin
with
but
when
i
get
a
few
brews
under
my
belt
i
tend
to
not
like
hoppy
flavors
if
you
dont
have
that
same
problem
then
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
overall
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
atleast
once
its
a
very
enjoyable
american
red
ale
pours
a
dark
cloudy
red
with
a
tall
and
thick
beige
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
rocky
lacing
smells
of
grains
and
sweet
malts
with
caramel
and
light
hoppiness
tastes
malty
with
a
candysweet
tone
and
some
slight
hop
bitterness
though
not
as
much
as
id
expected
or
hoped
for
mouthfeel
is
good
and
full
but
not
as
satisfying
as
i
feel
that
it
could
be
and
drinkability
is
good
i
had
their
other
amber
ale
last
night
the
american
amber
and
with
that
in
mind
im
less
impressed
than
i
might
be
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
a
pretty
middleoftheroad
one
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
very
dark
amber
body
and
a
nice
sized
tannish
head
a
real
looker
i
couldnt
smell
much
taste
is
easy
on
the
tongue
a
slight
hop
feel
that
lingers
a
bit
with
some
malt
this
would
make
a
great
social
beer
one
that
isnt
too
complex
but
isnt
simple
either
or
nasty
pouered
a
deep
garnet
with
massive
tannish
foamy
head
left
nice
lacing
while
slowly
falling
to
a
thin
coating
very
attractive
smell
is
mainly
summer
fruits
pears
apricots
wiht
a
slight
piney
hop
note
also
present
taste
is
very
strong
on
sweet
malt
with
a
nice
firm
fruitiness
the
hops
begin
to
show
their
presence
and
develop
into
a
nice
combination
with
the
malt
sweetness
excellent
balance
the
finish
is
more
dry
then
sweet
and
causes
a
strong
desire
for
the
next
taste
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
easy
drinkability
nice
session
beer
pretty
drinkable
but
doesnt
quite
pull
together
as
good
as
i
thought
up
front
i
will
try
again
to
make
sure
freshness
wasnt
a
factor
dont
think
so
i
had
three
reds
tonight
and
this
was
my
least
favorite
the
other
two
were
red
seal
and
avery
redpoint
kind
of
an
off
flavor
not
nearly
as
bright
as
the
other
two
looks
great
goes
down
easy
but
didnt
have
the
nice
malty
backbite
of
the
other
examples
i
had
tonight
ive
had
dead
guy
several
times
and
i
prefer
that
over
the
st
rogue
never
had
a
bad
rogue
but
this
is
one
of
the
least
impressive
of
their
brews
imo
burgundy
as
soon
as
the
bottle
popped
and
i
gravitated
my
snout
toward
the
neck
i
could
instantly
smell
the
usage
of
centennial
and
chinook
even
before
i
noticed
the
two
being
noted
on
the
bottle
im
getting
better
at
identifying
hops
the
nose
is
moderate
and
improves
drastically
as
its
agitated
piney
resinous
hops
combine
with
a
pretty
lackluster
malt
body
to
make
this
distinctly
rogue
offering
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
better
another
interesting
offering
from
this
brewery
japanese
bottle
states
that
the
abv
is
5
1
a
boring
style
that
really
comes
to
life
in
this
offering
good
flavors
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
an
old
standby
a
typically
solid
product
from
the
brewers
on
the
bay
pours
a
deep
dark
mahgony
color
with
a
12
off
white
head
with
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
has
some
hops
to
it
but
cannot
pick
anything
else
out
taste
has
a
mild
hoppy
upfront
with
a
malty
aftertaste
not
as
roasted
as
the
american
amber
ale
great
mouthfeel
goes
down
very
smooth
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
pours
a
nice
shade
of
mahogany
or
stained
cherry
it
has
quite
a
red
appearance
minimal
khaki
colored
head
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
a
bit
quiet
but
carmelled
malts
are
present
the
taste
is
malty
and
toasty
with
a
bit
of
pine
in
there
as
well
it
finishes
a
bit
yeasty
with
nice
bitterness
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
medium
mouthfeel
is
adequate
nice
drinkability
also
hard
to
say
much
more
than
that
about
this
beer
some
of
rogues
beers
have
such
similar
characters
to
one
another
that
the
only
thing
keeping
me
going
back
to
them
is
the
bottles
12
ounce
bottle
st
rogue
red
pours
out
a
clear
dark
red
color
with
a
large
yellowish
head
malty
caramel
aroma
with
a
large
dose
of
hops
thin
malty
flavor
with
piney
hops
and
an
alcoholic
bite
a
little
burnt
sugar
flavor
but
this
beer
is
mainly
bitter
finish
is
piney
hops
im
a
little
surprised
to
have
a
rogue
beer
with
such
a
thin
flavor
not
that
this
beer
is
thin
its
just
thin
for
a
rogue
beer
drinkability
is
good
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
exceptional
beers
from
this
brewery
flavor
is
a
nice
malt
hop
balance
though
i
expected
more
from
a
rogue
brew
i
like
that
the
hops
are
strong
but
not
bitter
nice
piney
citrus
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
toned
down
just
another
fine
rogue
offering
hey
a
little
bottle
conditioning
yeast
on
the
bottom

excellent
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
it
is
moderately
carbonated
this
to
me
is
a
session
beer
par
excellence
its
complex
not
too
strong
and
tasty
as
a
sumbitch
no
doubt
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
tickle
sweet
for
me
but
i
will
happily
drink
a
bomber
or
two
in
the
course
of
a
setting
this
beer
is
fairly
new
to
the
omaha
market
it
is
a
welcomed
addition
for
sure
tasty
and
likable
i
have
no
qualms
with
it
i
purchased
a
bomber
in
omaha
ne
try
one
if
you
have
not
i
think
this
is
really
improves
the
regular
st
rogue
red
a
dark
amber
american
ale
with
a
mildly
sharp
smell
this
ale
is
mildly
hoppy
but
has
a
rich
and
longlingering
sharp
aftertaste
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
mostly
due
to
this
beer
is
a
little
focused
on
the
hops
for
my
taste
there
are
other
rouge
beers
that
i
enjoy
better
than
this
one
this
beer
was
a
christmas
present
from
a
good
friend
it
poured
from
the
bottle
a
deep
clear
mahogany
with
some
red
highlights
its
topped
by
a
thick
fluffy
off
white
head
that
clings
to
the
side
in
clumps
as
it
settles
back
into
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
mild
grapefruit
citrus
aroma
backed
by
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
has
less
citrus
than
expected
its
a
pleasant
blend
of
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
and
the
ruby
red
grapefruit
from
the
hops
just
a
touch
of
the
pacman
tang
on
the
finish
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
good
drinkability
pours
a
lovely
red
color
with
decent
head
aromas
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
of
fruity
hops
make
up
the
nose
of
this
brew
the
taste
has
less
malt
flavor
then
what
i
expected
and
seems
to
consist
mainly
of
the
same
fruity
hops
noted
in
the
aroma
this
is
a
good
brew
nothing
more
nothing
less
not
really
what
id
call
an
amber
but
i
guess
the
ingredients
work
its
very
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
and
a
touch
of
molassas
though
tasty
it
finishes
much
less
than
clean
the
hops
add
an
earthiness
and
spiciness
that
resembles
cloves
and
wildflowers
though
interesting
and
complex
theres
too
much
muddling
to
consider
it
a
top
knotch
beer
the
bittering
hops
doesnt
balance
out
the
huge
barley
malt
sweetness
the
finish
is
sticky
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
aftertaste
is
all
malt
d
the
is
an
excellent
and
very
wellbalanced
red
ale
that
separates
itself
from
other
boring
red
ales
in
its
class
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
nice
job
rogue
bold
but
brilliant
my
complements
to
the
brewmaster
drinkability
definitely
worth
having
more
than
once
i
certainly
will
have
it
again
body
is
mediem
very
smooth
with
a
chewy
and
slick
texture
way
too
easy
to
drink
it
dissapears
quickly
pours
a
dark
redamber
in
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
head
very
nice
lacing
through
out
scents
of
malt
and
sweet
caramel
very
nice
taste
different
than
other
ambers
ive
had
maybe
more
sweet
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
medium
body
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beerale
not
sure
of
the
abv
though
but
would
most
likely
make
a
nice
short
drinking
session
another
brew
ive
passed
up
way
to
many
times
on
my
beer
shopping
ventures
i
just
started
consuming
this
brew
about
6
months
ago
and
wish
i
had
not
waited
so
long
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
red
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
gobble
at
this
point
still
room
for
improvement
maybe
maybe
not
i
think
if
it
just
kicked
in
a
little
more
maltedthickness
to
the
body
but
no
complaints
here
bottle
poured
a
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
hops
is
clearly
dominant
taste
is
quite
refreshing
with
a
nice
dose
of
caramel
malt
and
a
surprisingly
high
level
of
bitter
hops
at
the
end
not
the
most
complex
of
beer
but
the
high
level
of
hops
make
this
more
interesting
then
most
beers
in
this
style
this
red
ale
has
a
medium
feel
and
highly
drinkable
another
awesome
beer
from
roguewhich
may
be
the
best
brewer
in
america
overall
just
an
average
offering
from
rogue
worth
a
try
but
thats
about
it
ill
take
a
red
seal
ale
over
this
one
any
day
this
one
is
very
malty
with
an
excellent
hop
profile
to
balance
it
out
a
nice
session
brew
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
very
average
beer
better
than
most
mass
produced
inspite
of
appearance
just
seemed
watery
and
left
me
wanting
more
i
may
be
lost
in
high
alchol
high
hop
beercrack
land
deep
ruby
color
and
a
light
tan
sticky
head
good
head
retention
the
aroma
is
balanced
i
can
detect
both
bitter
hops
and
malts
in
equal
amounts
roasted
malts
are
slighty
more
dominant
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
i
find
the
taste
fairly
balanced
plendy
of
roasted
malts
and
spicy
hops
come
out
in
the
flavor
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
little
hoppy
good
drinkability
too
goes
down
easy
it
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
just
another
rogue
in
my
book
though
not
to
say
that
there
are
not
some
rogue
beers
that
go
above
and
beyond
my
expectations
every
time
i
revisit
them
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
beer
in
favor
of
other
rogue
products
the
next
time
my
inner
outlaw
is
unleashed
and
nothing
else
will
do
other
than
a
rogue
mouthfeeldrinkability
good
carbonation
that
mellows
after
a
while
medium
bodied
consistency
great
with
a
steak
a
bit
much
for
drinking
as
a
session
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
but
i
might
throw
it
in
there
in
the
mix
underrated
red
good
combination
and
balance
of
bitterness
hoppiness
and
malt
i
would
drink
this
as
a
staple
if
they
distributed
here
good
sumer
beer
by
itself
or
with
some
daytime
food
big
malty
head
and
offwhite
brown
colour
smooth
great
bottle
cartoon
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
im
going
to
keep
my
eyes
peeled
for
either
4
on
drinkability
might
increase
if
it
werent
90
degrees
outside
seems
a
bit
heavy
for
this
kind
of
night
pours
a
brilliant
brownred
with
a
nice
sized
head
very
strong
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
fruits
like
cherries
and
other
berries
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
lot
of
maltiness
making
this
a
sweet
and
potent
brew
some
hoppiness
is
also
present
in
the
beginning
very
easy
to
drink
and
was
delicious
with
some
fresh
crabs
pours
a
deep
crimsonhued
amber
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
retains
well
a
beautiful
beer
aroma
is
full
of
citrusy
mainly
grapefruit
hops
and
complex
bready
and
sweet
caramel
malt
scents
taste
is
aggresivley
hoppy
but
with
a
complex
malt
character
begins
with
a
caramel
and
molasses
sweet
malt
profile
that
is
lightly
bready
then
follows
with
citrusy
hops
flavors
mainly
grapefruit
and
orange
and
has
a
dry
bitter
finish
another
superb
rogue
brew
this
one
is
really
best
fresh
as
the
hops
seem
to
deteriorate
quickly
over
time
definitely
worth
a
try
not
bad
was
better
when
i
had
it
on
tap
a
few
months
ago
with
kmpitz
pours
a
clear
dark
red
body
with
a
big
tan
head
retention
was
good
as
was
the
lacing
smells
very
malty
and
bready
it
starts
going
downhill
with
the
taste
though
way
too
buttery
for
my
taste
malty
and
sweet
but
a
little
cloying
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
average
red
ale
pours
a
somewhat
cloude
medium
dark
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
good
longevity
and
very
good
lacing
aromas
of
a
nice
rich
malt
with
some
raisin
plum
and
vanilla
notes
slight
alcohol
too
smells
sweet
like
maple
at
first
the
tatse
is
of
a
stronger
ale
with
some
raisin
and
caramel
notes
a
lingering
roastiness
bitterness
is
left
on
the
sides
of
the
tounge
a
bit
too
much
i
think
i
enjoy
a
nice
red
ale
but
i
was
not
expecting
the
amount
of
roasted
malt
flavor
it
has
its
not
bad
just
too
much
for
me
in
a
red
ale
a
bit
watery
as
well
considering
its
roastiness
slightly
below
medium
carbonation
as
i
stated
its
a
quality
brew
just
not
one
of
the
better
reds

my

to
be

heavily
influenced
by
the
caramel
malts
and
the
beginning
and
it
finishes
with
a
nice
citrus
dry
hop
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
as
most
rouge
beers
are
made
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
one
definitely
grows
on
one
as
you
drink
it
very
disappointing
i
know
this
is
suppose
to
be
basically
the
same
as
santas
reserve
but
i
dont
see
how
tastes
initially
dry
irony
but
then
a
great
malty
and
caramel
steps
in
there
is
some
hint
of
floral
citrusy
hops
at
the
end
and
the
aftertaste
rises
as
a
repeat
of
the
caramel
and
malt
its
sweet
yet
has
a
crispness
hop
bitter
is
noticable
but
just
a
tingle
across
the
pallette
md
thick
mouthfeel
and
mildly
carbonated
the
flavors
are
really
well
balanced
and
overall
the
flavors
are
tune
with
the
hop
bitter
its
a
little
bit
rough
grassy
on
the
tongue
about
23
through
the
beer
which
is
starting
to
wear
considering
the
beer
now
seems
quite
dry
hops
are
also
more
prevalent
but
with
looking
i
can
still
find
sweet
in
the
middle
of
the
swallow
i
tried
subsequent
samples
with
a
choice
cut
of
ribeye
as
suggested
on
the
6pack
as
well
as
a
ham
sandwich
it
matched
rather
well
with
the
steak
where
carmelized
flavors
from
the
grill
mixed
well
with
sweet
maltiness
in
the
beer
hops
help
to
cleanse
the
palate
and
begin
the
combinatorial
process
again
a
plain
ham
sandwich
was
a
little
too
salty
and
the
mix
of
ham
and
red
ale
was
subsequently
unbalanced
dark
amber
with
a
nice
foamy
head
generally
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
dry
clean
finish
the
feel
is
nice
and
full
but
not
too
heavy
that
i
dont
enjoy
the
whole
22
on
my
own
while
not
really
distinctive
tasting
i
feel
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
so
it
earns
high
marks
on
taste
its
a
well
designed
beer
great
with
food
so
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
a
burger
and
a
st
rogues
red
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
previously
enjoyed
only
from
22
oz
bottles
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
almost
red
color
very
nice
aroma
is
malty
with
some
caramel
and
some
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
and
chewy
for
a
red
taste
is
excellent
sweet
a
little
dry
wellbalanced
hops
good
finish
drinkability
is
high
this
is
my
first
sixpack
of
this
particular
rogue
style
but
like
most
rogue
brews
i
would
not
hesitate
to
purchase
another
rogue
consistently
puts
out
enjoyable
approachable
and
very
drinkable
beers
st
rogue
red
is
no
exception
enjoyable
with
meals
slightly
unbalanced
but
pretty
good
sort
of
a
let
down
from
my
favorite
brewer
perhaps
the
darkest
of
the
ambers
ive
run
across
deep
garnet
and
under
a
bright
light
i
almost
see
a
touch
of
purple
bright
and
lively
in
the
mouth
rogue
was
more
reserved
in
hopping
than
i
expected
but
this
is
an
american
take
on
the
red
ale
style
with
some
wellmoderated
sharp
bittering
in
the
middle
finishes
out
with
some
malty
sweetness
not
stellar
but
a
solid
product
on
tap
poured
into
a
halfpint
glass
it
pours
a
medium
ruby
red
color
with
one
finger
of
head
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
fairly
hoppy
but
still
has
a
nice
amount
of
toasted
malt
character
the
taste
is
very
weird
slightly
burnt
and
maybe
smokey
malt
up
front
and
it
seems
to
have
a
candy
flavor
like
licorice
to
it
rather
odd
but
still
good
the
finish
is
nice
and
hoppy
really
piney
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
too
another
good
one
from
rogue
notes
not
the
type
of
beer
i
usually
go
after
but
surprisingly
drinkable
very
malty
brew
little
hop
presence
but
unique
fruit
and
spice
aromas
make
this
beer
worth
a
try
notes
good
contrasting
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
could
use
more
body
definitely
a
good
beer
brilliant
red
pour
with
a
big
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
smell
is
malty
with
some
caramel
and
just
a
little
bit
of
hops
flavor
is
a
pretty
thick
wall
of
malt
with
a
lot
of
chewy
grain
and
caramel
flavors
the
hops
come
through
very
faintly
in
the
finish
but
the
malt
really
evens
it
out
with
a
nice
roasty
flavor
not
a
bad
one
from
rogue
some
nice
fruity
malt
with
strident
underlying
hops
again
tastes
a
bit
of
tea
leaves
in
the
hoppy
flavors
nice
crisp
medium
bodied
brew
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
and
bite
and
a
fine
very
drinkable
red
ale
smooth
enough
for
a
session
beer
but
a
little
heavy
great
for
the
style
drinkability

i
hearken
back
to
the
80s
band
simply
red
its
not
too
exciting
but
its
certainly
drinkable
listenable
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
aromas
of
pine
and
caramel
citrus
pineapple
caramel
and
fruity
cherry
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
bitter
debating
on
trying
this
again
since
i
am
a
rogue
fan
from
the
bargan
table
at
corall
liquors
in
granite
city
this
one
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
caramel
malt
but
also
has
a
lot
of
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
mostly
caramel
malts
with
a
lot
of
hops
on
top
of
it
not
bad
but
not
really
my
style
the
body
is
right
about
where
it
should
be
now
i
know
some
folks
who
swear
that
this
is
one
of
the
finest
brews
ever
created
and
may
be
the
reason
that
god
gave
us
hops
to
begin
with
and
thats
fine
for
me
ill
pass
on
this
one
from
now
on
overall
i
would
say
this
one
ranks
very
well
as
one
of
my
favorite
brews
very
well
crafted
cheers
quite
drinkable
i
will
certainly
buy
it
again
and
again
get
me
another
beer
wench
they
didnt
have
growlers
available
godamn
it
there
were
other
interesting
brews
on
tap
not
many
as
the
old
bay
has
really
gone
down
hill
but
this
one
was
captivating
the
old
dog
has
learned
some
new
tricks
and
wont
go
down
so
easily
rogue
continues
to
impress
as
they
become
in
a
wierd
way
the
elder
statesmen
of
the
new
wave
of
american
micros
remarkably
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
it
poured
much
darker
and
thicker
than
i
thought
it
would
there
was
a
full
thick
head
that
would
never
quite
go
away
and
create
a
line
of
lace
for
every
sip
i
took
also
much
maltier
the
hops
were
there
very
smooth
but
the
malts
took
over
i
really
enjoyed
the
toffee
and
cream
flavors
all
in
all
a
very
rich
beer
that
i
would
greatly
enjoy
again
another
great
brew
from
rogue
find
it
and
try
it
if
you
havent
already
had
the
pleasure
youll
be
glad
you
did
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
nothing
too
flashy
just
a
good
solid
easy
drinking
ale
overall
a
delicious
hearty
brew
with
lots
of
malt
and
not
so
much
hops
another
tasty
rogue
brew
hell
yeah
these
guys
cannot
be
beaten
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
tall
and
creamy
head
aroma
is
full
and
very
inviting
smell
is
fairly
malty
much
maltier
than
the
beer
tastes
but
hops
have
a
strong
presence
too
taste
begins
with
piney
hops
becomes
nicely
balanced
towards
the
middle
and
finishes
mildly
sweet
very
enjoyable
overall
creamy
mouthfeel
just
adds
to
the
goodness
more
anything
from
rogue
please
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
in
fact
i
bought
a
growler
and
did
just
that
the
gummy
malt
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
balanced
by
the
lateaddition
hops
and
deliberately
leveling
dryhop
this
was
one
fantastic
beer
has
a
wellbalanced
malt
vs
spicy
bitter
flavor
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
some
milkduds
in
there
as
well
kind
of
chewy
but
smooth
going
down
very
drinkable
i
cant
believe
i
hadnt
had
this
one
before
but
then
again
so
many
beers
mediumfull
bodied
this
bomber
has
been
in
my
beer
fridge
for
months
at
least
i
kept
passing
it
over
for
more
interesting
looking
fare
but
i
now
realize
how
mistaken
i
was
st
rogue
red
is
one
fabulous
red
ale
maybe
the
best
that
ive
had
its
also
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
beers
and
thats
saying
something
pours
a
dark
cherry
wood
color
with
tan
head
that
is
impressive
to
the
eye
lacing
is
excellent
the
smell
is
strong
of
cherries
and
caramel
a
nice
blend
with
the
floralcitrus
hops
the
taste
is
strong
of
syrup
and
molasses
with
a
gorgeous
blend
of
floral
poppiseed
hops
very
fresh
to
the
taste
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
poured
slightly
hazy
bright
burgundyred
in
color
and
topped
with
a
full
head
of
creamy
foam
a
wall
of
sticky
foam
coated
the
entire
top
half
of
the
glass
the
aroma
yields
a
beautifully
sweet
florallike
hoppiness
with
strawberries
orange
liqueur
and
even
a
hint
of
lavender
the
taste
has
notes
of
bittersweet
black
cherries
with
a
sweet
malt
body
tangy
nice
body
full
flavored
and
the
finish
makes
you
smack
your
lips
for
more
one
i
would
surely
revisit
a
drinkable
beer
i
come
back
to
it
from
time
to
time
drinkability
i
could
have
had
these
all
night
awesome
beer
and
a
great
one
to
have
over
and
over
carbonation
is
a
little
coarse
on
this
one
but
forgivable
hops
assault
the
senses
with
the
first
sip
evoking
a
feeling
of
pine
though
this
is
followed
by
midsip
with
a
pleasant
maltiness
that
tempers
the
bitter
hops
by
the
end
of
the
sip
the
hops
are
back
in
force
the
well
balanced
smell
promised
in
the
nose
does
not
bear
fruit
in
the
taste
hops
dominate
too
much
here
st
rogue
red
achieves
a
fine
balance
of
momentous
proportions
this
beer
is
so
smooth
and
so
drinkable
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
of
those
poor
lost
souls
who
still
drink
bud
this
is
only
my
second
sample
of
of
rogue
beer
which
was
somewhat
disappointing
but
i
know
they
have
better
out
there
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
all
the
same
yikes
i
think
i
experienced
a
rogue
brew
that
i
didnt
like
somewhat
i
saw
the
reviews
for
this
beer
and
saw
somewhat
an
above
average
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
man
this
didnt
do
it
for
me
poured
out
a
murky
copperamber
color
with
some
alright
carbonation
in
there
smell
consisted
of
some
piney
caramel
very
slight
malts
and
some
hops
it
was
more
like
piney
hops
taste
was
a
let
down
i
thought
hops
attack
the
palate
and
lasts
all
the
way
through
the
aftertaste
where
were
the
malts
and
caramel
it
wasnt
balanced
as
i
though
it
was
going
to
be
along
with
the
hops
came
some
roasted
flavors
but
not
very
much
a
bit
of
a
let
down
whereas
american
amber
ascends
above
a
sometimes
mundane
style
st
rogue
red
does
not
thats
not
to
say
this
is
awful
just
standardized
and
forgettable
another
solid
rogue
beer
and
one
id
been
meaning
to
try
for
a
while
they
certainly
make
some
good
hop
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
and
one
id
gladly
have
again
a
decent
beer
but
ive
never
been
the
biggest
red
ale
fan
and
this
didnt
make
me
one
hmm
wheres
the
hops
i
normally
enjoy
this
as
dry
hopped
red
on
draft
which
basically
rules
this
was
a
totally
different
beer
experience
so
different
i
thought
i
was
drinking
an
octoberfest
anyway
beer
was
a
medium
reddish
amber
low
to
no
head
aroma
was
on
the
malty
side
the
mouthfeel
was
definitely
full
very
thick
and
almost
but
not
quite
syrupy
the
oddest
thing
about
this
one
was
when
drinking
the
initial
taste
was
of
some
hop
bitterness
followed
by
fullon
maltiness
bit
of
a
reverse
from
the
normal
process
ill
be
honest
i
thought
the
hops
got
a
bit
lots
this
is
a
decidedly
malty
brew
wasnt
that
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
it
was
about
the
thickest
ive
ever
experienced
in
a
beer
ill
stick
with
the
draft
dry
hop
version
which
i
love
this
brew
is
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
large
foam
tan
head
leaves
behind
good
lace
nice
hop
scent
slight
caramel
malt
the
taste
has
a
nice
bitter
hop
streak
not
as
intense
as
brutal
bitter
but
similar
hops
i
would
guess
some
well
integrated
caramelroast
malt
very
well
blended
great
taste
an
all
around
good
beer
this
one
poured
a
good
dark
red
color
with
a
small
frothy
white
head
that
left
an
unusual
ammount
of
lace
for
its
size
the
smell
was
quite
dark
with
a
deep
carmel
malt
scent
accented
with
a
great
hop
smell
as
well
the
taste
was
of
burnt
carmel
malt
and
a
slight
dry
hoppiness
that
stood
out
and
gave
a
great
presence
definantly
a
good
beer
to
go
back
to
the
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
aroma
which
boasts
of
crystal
malts
and
fruity
yeast
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
malty
yet
bitter
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
you
with
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
it
is
the
worst
rogue
brew
ive
tried
but
its
still
better
than
most
the
sediments
left
in
the
bottle
were
mighty
tasty
as
i
find
them
to
be
with
other
rogue
ales
pour
it
in
the
glass
and
drink
it
down
dont
waste
the
best
part
deep
reddishamber
slightly
hazy
body
with
an
inch
thick
beige
colored
head
and
a
good
deal
of
latent
carbonation
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
a
whiff
of
sourdough
bread
along
with
a
decent
dose
of
piney
and
floral
hops
that
are
typical
of
rogue
the
taste
is
dominantly
caramelized
malts
along
with
some
sourness
and
a
hint
nuts
and
smoke
the
hops
are
assertively
bitter
at
the
start
of
each
sip
and
reemerge
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
is
helped
along
by
the
high
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
has
a
decent
session
potential
but
is
a
bit
too
bitter
when
consumed
at
cooler
than
cellar
temperature
as
it
warms
to
near
room
temperature
a
more
robust
sweet
and
malty
character
emerges
midpalette
making
the
beer
much
more
appealing
tongueland
crisp
and
sweet
malts
really
came
out
mixed
with
sweetness
comparable
to
honey
as
warmed
caramel
and
hops
emerged
competing
for
playing
time
the
alcohol
slightly
emerged
in
a
warming
sense
as
i
progressed
and
this
was
a
welcoming
feeling
delectable
but
not
as
good
as
aviator
red
from
flying
bison
buffalo
ny
the
sunset
grill
and
tap
had
this
brew
listed
as
an
ipa
it
would
fit
that
traditional
style
but
not
with
the
west
coast
intensity
that
folks
might
expect
this
ale
was
red
and
good
its
deep
color
contrasted
nicely
with
the
modest
and
fading
head
the
aromas
were
mostly
grassy
with
hints
of
the
more
floral
aspects
of
the
hops
the
flavors
were
quite
well
balanced
with
a
grassy
hop
presence
that
becomes
quite
fruity
all
over
a
sweet
and
enticing
malt
backbone
its
a
mediumbodied
session
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
again
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
go
well
with
food
or
just
sitting
around
with
friends
a
drinkable
brew
good
for
a
heavy
meal
but
there
are
better
poured
from
a
brown
bomber
i
can
easily
compare
this
to
the
style
since
i
had
it
between
a
pair
of
killians
this
is
a
much
darker
beer
than
the
coors
product
smell
is
also
more
rich
in
those
delicious
hops
and
caramel
smelling
malts
excellently
balanced
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
sweet
and
bitter
exactly
what
i
think
a
red
should
be
poured
a
dark
rich
deep
red
color
it
had
a
solid
head
its
somewhat
but
not
totally
creamy
but
some
it
dissapates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
there
was
a
hop
presence
through
and
through
the
beer
i
dont
think
there
was
a
sip
without
something
present
in
the
flavor
it
doesnt
smack
you
in
the
face
by
any
means
but
it
is
nice
to
have
that
kind
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
malt
provided
a
solid
backbone
to
this
beer
highly
quaffable
and
extremely
drinkable
the
yeast
provides
a
nice
balance
in
this
brew
more
than
standard
but
less
than
phenomenal
this
a
very
nicely
and
well
puttogether
ale
if
you
can
drink
it
you
can
go
the
distance
with
this
brew
it
is
another
finely
crafter
product
from
the
boys
from
rogue
well
played
gentlemen
well
played
indeed

the
deepest

toasted

sweetness
mixes
well
with

not
overwhelming
dose
of
chinook

bitterness
is
there
but
not
over
the
top
characterstic
rogue
aftertaste
must
be
the
pacman
yeast
certianly
quaffable
in
a
style
that
for
me
is
hard
to
define
i
like
this
beer
but
not
sure
why
unbalanced
tannic
somewhat
short
on
character
but
surprisingly
interesting
definately
worth
a
try
the
head
was
unimpressive
although
a
nice
copperwhite
color
this
was
on
the
bottom
end
of
the
rogue
brews
that
i
have
had
nice
malts
but
not
interesting
much
prefer
its
bigger
brother
the
santas
private
reserve
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
good
drinkable
ale
the
hops
in
this
beer
lend
an
almost
tropical
air
something
initially
rather
unexpected
but
certainly
not
a
bad
thing
the
malt
pushes
its
way
into
the
limelight
in
time
to
stop
the
hops
from
stealing
the
show
theres
a
saucy
spicy
balance
that
draws
you
into
looking
for
the
next
one
the
grapefruit
presence
almost
delivers
the
sensation
of
pulp
wonderfully
quaffable
i
like
the
way
it
plays
and
ill
definitely
come
back
for
multiple
acts
this
has
a
candy
like
finish
and
then
the
bitterness
seems
to
reappear
after
swallowing
definitely
a
heavier
bodied
red
ale
which
is
a
good
thing
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
deep
reddish
copper
with
a
rocky
beige
head
sprucy
hops
and
sweet
crystal
malt
aromas
sweetened
tea
maltiness
with
a
good
bit
of
astringency
from
the
hops
this
beer
is
very
quaffable
strong
enough
and
hoppy
enough
to
make
it
a
sessioner
on
draught
probably
very
sweet
malt
to
this
red
ale
slick
on
the
tongue
high

are
sweet
too

very

with

in

taste
remarkably
similar
to
the

just
less

here
the

i
think
this
beer
is
incredible
with
the

sweet

tasting
of
cereal

with
a
nice
touch

my
go
to

from
now
on

im
still
a

this

is
so
balanced
and
reserved

flavorful
and
filling
i
love
it

a

the

this
is
a
damn
nice
beer
i
am
becoming
more
and
more
impressed
with
rogue
innnnteresting
a
deep
ruby
brew
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
lace
atop
this
doesnt
smell
like
a
rogue
brew
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
wheres
the
hops
in
the
nose
oh
wait
i
just
took
a
sip
and
i
found
them
lacking
hops
in
the
nose
it
gives
you
a
pretty
rich
amount
in
the
flavor
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
as
well
but
not
all
that
much
else
an
easy
drinker
that
would
make
for
a
nice
session
while
not
being
a
hoppy
tongue
destroyer
note
hoppy
tongue
destroyers
rule
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
for
the
caliber
of
a
brewery
like
rogue
its
about
average
the
nose
is
highly
aromatic
and
combines
a
most
lovely
caramel
malt
with
strong
whiffs
of
floral
hopping
quite
a
nice
aroma
to
this
little
beauty
the
taste
is
failry
full
and
has
at
once
a
strong
malt
sweetness
that
is
overtly
pushed
around
by
very
strongly
bittering
hops
these
hops
are
a
strong
surprise
in
a
red
and
even
more
so
at
this
strength
level
the
feel
is
very
good
and
gives
a
nice
crisp
end
to
each
draw
very
nicely
drinkable
ale
an
overall
good
yet
slightly
uninspired
brew
from
the
folks
at
rogue
its
certainly
not
a
misfire
but
not
amongst
thier
best
it
looks
like
your
typical
red
ale
after
its
poured
medium
amber
in
colour
with
a
medium
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
hoppy
and
hint
at
a
fruity
sweetness
as
well
but
at
times
are
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
liking
this
in
turn
takes
away
from
the
overall
smoothness
that
i
associate
with
a
red
ale
its
a
bit
different
and
still
tasty
but
just
not
in
the
league
of
other
rogue
brews
overall
a
decent
beer
it
somewhat
reminds
me
of
a
british
style
ipa
call
me
crazy

im
not
a
big
fan
of
the

i
really

early

rather
quickly

lightly
caramel

with

made
up
of

a
faint

you

this

a
bitter
beer
not

the

to
almost
add

im
enjoying

go
i
cant

had

this
one

with

have
very
small

of

maybe
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness

hops

it

poured
a

left
some

the
smell
was
very
hoppy
but
with
some

in

as
the

implies
this
ale
tasted
like

with

potent

the
taste
had

also
a

was

is
malty
with
notes

mouthfeel
is
smooth

medium
to
full

an
excellent
treat
this
is
flavor
is
almost
half
malt
and
half
hops
with
a
bitterness
that
is
well
blended
a
malty
flavor
that
is
a
bit
sweet
like
a
scotch
ale
almost
excellent
work
guys
as
i
said
earlier
i
have
never
been
a
fan
or
red
ales
before
but
this
could
make
me
a
convert
the
taste
started
with
nice
maltiness
with
slight
caramel
and
nutty
undertones
followed
by
the
lovely
dry
hops
flavour
most
reds
i
have
had
before
have
had
to
much
sweetness
the
hoppiness
at
the
end
definately
balanced
this
out
and
gave
it
balance
and
enhanced
the
overall
mouthfeel
while
not
my
favourite
rogue
this
beer
was
better
than
expected
and
a
very
very
nice
brew
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
medium
dark
reddish
orange
with
a
large
rocky
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
mild
maltiness
with
a
pronounce
cedarysprucey
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
breadlike
with
a
strong
but
pleasing
cedary
hoppy
finish
and
a
nice
full
and
rounded
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
bitter
red
ale
with
lingering
hoppiness
a
nice
one
overall
a
very
solid
red
ale
and
not
a
hop
bomb
either
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
drinkability
im
not
pleased
at
all
with
this
beer
i
expect
a
red
ale
my
favorite
style
to
be
quite
malty
and
perhaps
a
bit
hoppy
but
definitely
without
the
fruity
citrusy
side
in
fact
i
am
disappointed
to
the
point
that
i
shant
even
make
the
effort
of
trying
it
again
this
is
not
what
red
ale
is
about
at
all
ok
aside
from
the
color
imo
i
got
this
growler
from
half
time
beverages
in
puoghkeepsie
n
y
you
have
simply
got
to
go
there
if
you
canwhat
an
incredible
place
see
all
the
beerfly
reviews
anyway
this
hoppy
brew
pours
a
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
understated
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
yes
there
was
hops
and
a
touch
of
rosy
sweetness
the
taste
however
was
far
more
intricate
i
loved
the
first
blast
of
hops
bitterness
which
then
mellowed
into
a
balanced
semisweet
finish
good
mouthfeel
definitely
worth
it
and
my
wife
loved
it
too
dark
reddish
brown
pour
with
a
medium
head
that
held
up
pretty
well
the
nose
was
malty
good
hoppiness
as
well
with
underlying
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
was
nicely
hopped
good
maltiness
and
a
slight
fuity
sweetness
to
follow
good
overall
balance
and
body
an
enjoyable
beer
not
my
favorite
from
rogue
but
good
nonetheless
one
of
the
better
tasting
red
ales
ive
ever
drunk
and
down
and
im
sure
ill
revisit
it
again
and
again
quite
a
nice
little
beer
the
22oz
serving
size
in
the
typically
handsome
rogue
bottle
was
a
bit
short
i
felt
maybe
magnums
are
in
order
cloudy
apple
cider
in
appearance
minimal
tancolored
head
laces
quite
nicely
aromas
predictably
are
of
hops
not
quite
as
heavy
as
expected
but
distinctly
hoppy
with
just
a
slight
sweet
undertone
in
the
background
taste
was
not
as
overthetop
rogueesque
hoppy
as
i
d
expected
especially
for
a
beer
that
was
dryhopped
hoppy
flavor
with
a
surprisinglybalanced
malt
sweetness
noted
as
well
however
there
was
an
almost
icedtea
flavor
to
this
beer
as
it
warmed
mouthfeel
is
smooth
though
slightly
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
is
tolerable
i
was
slightly
disappointed
by
this
offering
from
rogue
given
my
typical
love
for
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
them
while
i
didnt
plan
to
review
any
of
the
brews
i
tried
at
the
aobf
this
one
just
stuck
in
my
mind
because
it
was
such
a
disappointment
coming
from
a
brewery
that
puts
out
consistently
great
beer
what
i
find
strange
is
that
i
really
like
their
doublethehops
winter
version
of
this
santas
private
reserve
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
good
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
taste
upfront
this
beer
was
all
caramel
malt
and
butter
then
a
plum
and
tart
juniper
flavor
kicked
in
that
intermingled
with
a
mild
pineyhops
bitterness
that
arose
on
the
finish
very
straightforward
and
full
flavored
but
without
much
complexity
this
brew
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
big
creamy
tan
head
that
for
a
bit
then
settles
to
a
minimal
head
leaving
a
sexy
lace
behind
moderate
to
high
hop
aroma
along
with
a
pale
malt
smell
fill
the
nose
light
bodied
red
ale
makes
for
a
strong
hop
flavor
along
with
a
earthy
tones
fill
the
palatte
a
musty
sort
of
taste
is
not
to
bad
either
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
from
a
great
brewery
i
bought
this
beer
because
i
wanted
to
see
how
rogue
handled
the
red
style
instead
what
i
sampled
was
just
an
over
hopped
ipa
all
i
could
taste
was
hops
and
plenty
of
them
it
did
have
the
red
color
but
it
tasted
like
an
ipa
if
rogue
could
just
turn
the
hops
down
im
sure
the
finer
quality
of
the
red
style
will
shine
through
not
a
bad
brew
a
bit
unbalanced
lacking
and
average
leaning
heavily
towards
to
the
hop
character
malty
aroma
is
deceiving
too
overall
not
one
of
rogues
best
but
certainly
drinkable
and
appealing
here
and
there
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
a
lot
from
this
beer
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
since
it
was
listed
as
an
ipa
i
dont
think
this
is
an
ipa
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
a
sweet
fruity
taste
was
unexpected
but
welcome
the
hops
are
quite
strong
as
well
i
never
thought
a
beer
so
packed
with
hops
could
be
so
sweet
the
balance
here
is
superb
hats
off
to
rogue
if
you
like
the
st
rogue
red
or
just
like
hoppy
beers
try
this
if
you
can
find
it
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
my
glass
a
sanguineous
color
the
head
reasonable
in
size
spumous
in
texture
light
tan
in
color
as
it
evanesces
the
lace
nice
thick
clinging
sheets
the
aroma
of
hop
flowers
cotton
candy
sweet
malted
grains
fresh
crisp
and
clean
a
very
labyrinthine
nose
to
be
sure
sweet
start
lots
of
malt
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
stinging
in
its
acidity
dynamic
in
its
hop
spiciness
dry
hop
bitter
aftertaste
seals
off
a
very
interesting
and
quaffable
brew
i
had
this
on
tap
and
was
most
impressed
with
this
beer
its
a
goodlooking
red
with
a
nice
sticky
head
the
smell
of
hops
is
very
pleasant
with
notes
of
pine
the
taste
is
a
delightful
blend
of
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
keep
em
coming
the
numerical
part
of
the
ba
rating
system
has
become
more
difficult
for
me
tonight
after
tasting
so
many
great
beers
well
actually
only
two
the
corsendonk
and
now
a
bomber
of
this
id
like
to
rename
this
beer
arrogant
bastard
light
thats
just
my
opinion
though
it
pours
a
a
nice
brown
color
with
large
rocky
had
that
goes
away
kind
of
quickly
as
for
the
taste
if
youe
ever
tried
arrogant
bastard
you
could
say
that
this
tastes
like
a
light
version
not
to
say
that
this
beer
isnt
good
and
doesnt
have
a
certain
unique
characteristic
but
arrogant
bastard
lite
is
all
i
can
think
about
as
a
rule
of
thumb
however
you
cant
go
wrong
with
any
rogue
product
notes
a
decent
red
ale
actually
it
is
quite
tasty
in
a
laid
back
way
though
i
like
its
alternate
ego
dry
hop
red
which
is
the
tapped
version
that
is
dryhopped
to
the
hilt
i
found
this
to
be
a
perfect
pairing
with
my
hells
fire
beef
stew
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
ale
as
red
ale
is
usually
not
my
favorite
color
is
a
deep
reddish
amber
and
a
thick
tan
head
leaves
exceptional
thick
rings
of
lace
smell
is
earthy
and
healthy
taste
is
very
smooth
and
mouthfeel
decent
excellent
drinkability
makes
this
one
a
winner
in
my
book
a
straight
4
from
the
judges
a
very
good
red
the
label
is
right
its
red
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
fairly
big
head
dissapates
quickly
leaves
some
lace
you
taste
the
hops
right
off
the
bat
smooth
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
again
a
hoppy
finish
not
over
done
on
the
hops
though
just
enough
to
let
you
know
this
is
an
american
ale
brewed
in
the
northwest
good
beer
i
havent
had
a
bad
one
from
rougue
yet
still
theres
tastier
ones
out
there
nice
thick
meaty
head
off
the
pour
deep
dark
rich
amber
in
color
huge
lace
to
decorate
the
glass
fruity
overtones
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
wow
outstanding
roasty
malty
and
hoppy
mixture
in
one
great
flavor
rush
another
winning
beer
from
rogue
had
this
in
a
22
oz
bomber
this
is
another
solid
rogue
ale
that
fits
my
taste
it
pours
a
deep
garnet
color
as
the
name
may
imply
with
a
durable
head
that
laces
well
the
smell
is
typical
of
rogue
products
its
hoppy
there
is
certainly
a
hearty
dose
of
those
pacific
northwest
hops
in
this
red
ale
the
taste
at
first
is
somewhat
malty
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
the
pacman
yeast
but
once
again
the
hops
penetrate
through
creating
an
enjoyable
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
with
drinkability
ranking
high
this
a
medium
bodied
brew
and
would
make
a
pretty
solid
session
beer
in
my
opinion
that
is
if
you
like
your
redamber
ales
with
a
generous
dose
of
bittering
hops
i
know
i
do
st
rogue
red
is
the
base
for
santas
private
reserve
but
with
half
the
hops
which
is
amazing
to
me
because
as
in
typical
rogue
fashion
the
balance
to
this
beer
already
leans
toward
the
hop
end
and
this
is
good
if
you
enjoy
a
mouthful
of
oily
hops
oh
sure
the
malt
makes
itself
evident
in
the
nose
and
the
beginning
of
your
draught
but
the
hops
are
kickin
its
ass
out
of
your
memory
in
no
time
tasty
reddish
to
light
copper
colored
aromas
are
predominantly
citrusy
hops
with
a
small
amount
of
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
more
balanced
with
the
hops
pronounced
at
the
start
and
the
malt
fighting
for
position
towards
the
finish
making
more
headway
as
the
beer
warms
very
solid
fairly
dark
for
an
amber
very
dark
shade
of
copper
brown
at
some
angles
it
verges
on
black
when
light
passes
through
it
it
looks
blood
red
head
is
offwhite
and
fairly
creamy
nose
is
mostly
citrusy
slightly
floral
hops
some
malt
lingers
underneath
taste
is
a
contrast
between
the
bright
crisp
colors
of
the
hops
and
the
truly
earthy
taste
character
of
the
malt
it
reminds
me
of
a
picture
of
a
gloved
hand
grimy
from
working
in
a
garden
holding
the
a
freshly
cut
bright
yellow
flower
i
know
its
weird
but
thats
what
it
reminds
me
of
this
is
a
bit
hoppy
for
an
amber
but
a
good
beer
great
ambermahogany
color
with
some
pretty
good
carbonation
and
white
head
bitterness
gets
you
from
the
beginning
and
ends
up
balancing
nicely
with
the
sweeter
malts
more
bitter
than
i
am
used
to
in
an
amber
but
very
nice
pours
out
of
the
22
oz
bomber
a
deep
dark
amber
with
a
healthy
offwhite
head
beautiful
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
nw
hops
nice
full
mouthfeel
lots
of
fruiten
malts
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
in
the
forefront
a
balanced
rogue
brew
esp
if
you
like
your
brews
on
the
bitter
side
lingering
malt
flavours
in
the
aftertaste
no
problem
putting
this
bomber
down
delicious
stuff

head

nicely
got
a

thin
but
some
stayed
nice
sweet
malty
smell
balanced
with
alot
of
hops
very
balanced
taste
as
well
some
sweetness
in
the

and
very
noticable
crisp
hop
finish
medium
body
which
was
expected
complimented
a
grilled
chicken
and
roasted
corn
on

cob
dinner
perfectly
a
very
drinkable
amber
ale
the
only
one
i
had
of
the
others
listed
i
thought
it
was
very
pleasant
flavorful
and
balanced
this
beer
had
a
very
dark
ambergarnet
color
to
it
pouring
out
it
formed
a
nice
medium
tan
head
with
plenty
of
lace
as
it
subsided
the
aroma
was
of
both
malt
and
hops
which
almost
heralded
the
astringent
flavor
that
you
knew
had
to
be
coming
after
that
frangrance
slightly
sweet
but
not
as
sweet
as
others
which
i
think
is
good
usually
the
macros
put
a
name
red
but
nothing
to
it
other
micros
add
too
much
flavor
this
might
be
the
proper
balance
but
will
have
to
sample
more
red
ales
to
make
that
determination
pours
dark
amber
with
creamy
offwhite
head
that
has
some
retention
and
forms
nice
rings
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
about
half
and
half
of
hops
and
malt
at
first
i
thought
it
was
predominantly
hops
but
after
smelling
more
theres
definite
malt
aroma
too
medium
to
full
bodied
there
is
nothing
spectacular
about
tasting
this
brew
theres
some
malt
theres
some
nw
hops
but
im
also
getting
a
slightly
astringint
offflavor
on
the
tongue
and
especially
lingering
after
i
drink
this
is
one
that
i
ordered
from
vintage
cellar
and
maybe
it
had
been
sitting
too
long
if
not
this
is
a
very
average
brew
from
an
outstanding
brewery
probably
the
worst
rogue
beer
ive
had
in
years
30
a
well
rounded
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
rich
tasting
for
a
red
ale
but
doesnt
become
bitter
towards
the
end
not
your
average
red
beer
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
rogue
hearty
body
and
highly
hopped
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
casual
not
a
hoppy
amber
but
it
has
a
smooth
malty
after
taste

personally
dont
like

overall
a
rather
easy
drinking
brew
overall
with
a
good
flavor
nothing
too
spectacular
but
a

just
another
average
amber
ale
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
one
after
expecting
a
lot
more
from
it
given
the
reviews
it
gets
here
the
fact
that
it
is
a
rogue
beer
but
it
failed
to
deliver
for
me
with
the
taste
being
a
particular
let
down
there
was
a
decent
enough
malt
taste
to
the
beer
but
i
had
been
expecting
more
hops
to
it
as
well
just
more
flavour
really
at
first
i
feared
the
can
was
past
its
best
but
when
i
checked
the
date
it
was
a
mere
couple
of
months
old
so
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
problem
it
just
seems
like
this
beer
wasnt
for
me
and
its
not
one
ill
go
back
to
im
afraid
i
like
overall
3
66
yes
a
good
brew
i
dont
know
if
ill
finish
the
pint
because
its
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
however
the
taste
is
there
and
so
is
the
aroma
after
awhile
it
gets
bothersome
and
i
did
end
up
pouring
half
of
it
out
as
i
was
eating
and
it
wasnt
mixing
well
id
recommend
you
try
this
one
at
least
to
see
what
you
think
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
and
yes
you
are
right
that
can
did
reach
me
by
way
of
the
legendary
woodychandler
has
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
kind
of
malty
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
is
mild
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
some
light
malts
easy
drinking
but
a
bit
subdued
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
pulled
the
pin
with
a
loud
crack
on
this
pineapple
and
when
i
realized
that
it
was
far
from
a
dud
or
an
inert
round
i
initiated
an
inverted
glug
a
quick
pseudocascade
formed
a
fizzy
finger
of
tawny
head
with
limited
retention
time
was
ticking
away
so
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
to
gauge
my
options
color
was
a
deep
amberlight
copper
to
copper
srm
13
o
solid
overall
balanced
just
a
touch
simple
extremely
balanced
and
easy
drinking
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
with
all
the
profile
pieces
i
want
in
an
amber
my
only
regret
and
its
small
is
that
the
thin
watery
feel
doesnt
allow
the
flavor
to
truly
blossom
the
taste
is
incredibly
malt
forward
with
the
sweetness
of
sugar
caramel
toffee
butterscotch
raisins
and
molasses
the
hop
bitterness
is
mild
but
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
than
on
the
nose
o
this
amber
has
really
nice
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
but
also
has
a
sturdy
backbone
to
make
it
a
highly
enjoyable
and
balanced
amber
ale
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
frosted
pint

in

a

thought
popped
in

that

pair
well
with

then
i
glance
at
the
bottle
theres
a
little
picture
of
a

rogue
read
my
mind
here
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
i
thought
not
something
i
would
reccomend
or
likely
try
again
o
very
clean
with
great
balance
really
good
beer
another
surprisingly
tasty
amber
this
is
a
much
different
amber
than
i
expect
and
i
put
off
reviewing
this
one
for
sometime
but
i
cant
say
i
am
disappointed
by
this
at
all
overall
good
bottle
at
banquet
night
aha
philadelphia
6292013
a
touch
of
bready
and
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
citrus
and
pine
nice
clean
beer
but
a
bit
dated
quite
tasty
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
really
like
this
beer
but
had
never
tried
it
it
is
good
smellwise
it
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
it
is
beautiful
to
look
at
and
enjoyable
to
drink
however
everything
else
kind
of
falls
short
it
is
a
good
beer
and
is
wellbalanced
on
the
whole
but
i
had
a
nagging
wish
the
whole
time
that
it
was
all
taken
up
a
notch
i
imagine
on
tap
it
would
be
delicious
would
have
again
would
be
a
great
session
beer
its
certainly
more
flavorful
and
interesting
than
most
amber
ales
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
balanced
and
not
extreme
which
is
good
for
a
change
and
still
not
dull
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
because
it
isnt
as
malty
compared
to
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
ive
enjoyed
this
often
and
now
it
comes
in
cans
great
amber
ale
overallslightly
better
than
average
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
one
the
flavors
ate
almost
there
but
never
quite
develop
i
would
only
buy
this
on
closeout
rogue
does
it
again
with
a

pours
a
nice
ruby
red
hue
with
a
medium
lasting
off
white
head
good
head
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
yeast
sweet
fruity
esters
and
a
bit
of
toffee
and
earthy
pine
hops
fill
the
senses
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
and
fruity
flavors
with
some
good
earthy
pine
hops
bitterness
palalte
is
a
medium
body
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
finishes
with
a
combination
of
caramel
malt
yeast
some
toffee
and
fruity
notes
followed
by
some
good
earthy
piney
hops
for
balance
overall
a
very
good
enjoyable
and
solid
all
around
amber
ale
very
nice
i
wont
have
it
again
good
to
try
but
nothing
out
of
ordinary
i
get
lots
of
caramel
malts
up
front
toasted
bready
hop
is
juicy
floral
a
little
citrusy
drybitter
finish
body
is
medium
juicy
mouthfeel
a
little
dry
carbonation
is
low
this
beer
is
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
lingering
white
head
the
nose
matches
the
taste
perfectly
at
first
i
was
caught
off
guard
by
the
bitterness
and
citrusy
profile
to
be
honest
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
they
used
orange
while
brewing
because
oranges
are
strong
in
the
flavor
profile
this
is
borderline
ipa
in
my
opinion
there
is
also
a
fair
share
of
toffee
notes
breaddy
flavors
and
smooth
light
caramel
flavors
this
beer
is
rounded
out
by
a
nice
presence
from
rogues
signature
yeast
a
solid
fruity
red
ale
o
as
far
as
amber
ales
go
it
is
a
good
example
it
is
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
flavor
alot
going
on
for
a
simple
amber
big
body
is
broken
up
just
enough
by
the
carbonation
giving
a
full
mouthfeel
sweet
toasted
grainy
bread
up
front
lightly
buttered
with
sugar
free
jam
caramel
with
a
touch
of
raisin
some
apple
flavors
and
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
piney
hops
come
into
balance
and
complicate
flavors
very
very
good
and
very
complex
with
tons
of
layers
even
though
its
released
in
the
summer
this
is
definitely
a
winter
brew
to
me
due
to
the
flavor
profile
and
heartiness
of
this
beer
good
show
from
rogue
this
is
a
decent
amber
but
simple
the
apple
and
sweet
caramel
notes
are
overdone
the
hop
character
is
citrusy
and
blend
with
the
sweetness
rather
than
offer
balance
ultimately
there
is
nothing
here
to
seperate
this
one
from
the
pack
ill
pass
in
the
future
o
i
like
this
and
would
have
it
again
o
nice
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
id
enjoy
it
more
in
a
pub
not
quite
special
enough
for
home
drinking
overall
this
is
a
fine
draught
beer
but
i
will
try
it
from
the
bottle
when
i
get
a
chance
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
very
little
to
no
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
very
smooth
overall
feel
really
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
this
is
a
very
good
amber
ale
that
i
will
seek
out
again
o
really
good
very
complex
without
being
overpowering
overall
this
is
a
nice
bready
ale
with
some
cool
malts
and
an
interesting
back
bite
it
includes
all
of
the
essentials
of
a
beer
yeast
hops
malts
yet
it
still
only
seems
like
only
a
mildly
good
beer
in
the
end
not
amazing
but
a
good
drink
taste
is
similarly
toasty
and
bready
and
pretty
well
typical
of
an
american
amber
ale
overall
a
solid
if
unremarkable
amber
overall
entirely
drinkable
amber
with
just
enough
punchy
flavor
to
keep
it
lively
and
interesting
poured
this
american
amber
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
amber
color
produced
a
light
tannish
head
excellent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
ale
consists
of
caramel
toffee
and
piney
hops
medium
in
body
this
american
amber
ale
is
smooth
has
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
highlights
caramel
malt
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hops
excellent
example
of
an
american
amber
ale
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
of
its
kind
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thick
and
not
enough
carbonation
for
my
liking
the
rogue
american
amber
is
a
decent
amber
ale
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
with
thin
slightly
off
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
decent
lace
the
smell
is
rather
bland
some
sweet
malt
scent
but
overall
not
the
best
amber
i
have
smelled
the
taste
is
solid
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
but
there
is
a
dry
bitterness
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
solid
amber
but
not
the
best
balanced
amber
i
have
had
amber
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
dropped
a
floral
resin
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
hits
your
nose
though
maybe
i
should
have
said
that
in
reverse
order
flavor
starts
sweet
from
the
caramel
malt
and
closes
out
with
the
floral
hops
and
a
dry
finish
good
balance
to
this
one
carbonated
and
and
light
a
nice
take
on
an
amber
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
the
dry
finish
to
this
thing
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
just
a
bit
not
sure
it
suits
the
style
for
me
o
good
session
beer
very
drink
able
nice
full
two
finger
head
of
orangetinted
tan
almost
all
microfoam
with
an
even
surface
and
delicate
to
the
touch
the
lacing
is
not
overpowering
but
where
it
sticks
it
sticks
in
thick
streaks
the
liquid
is
a
cloudy
glowing
opaque
amber
red
every
bit
true
to
the
category
equal
parts
brown
and
orange
rust
hordes
of
loose
bubbles
scattered
throughout
the
nose
seems
to
take
pains
to
play
down
the
malt
side
of
the
equation
all
pine

it
up
big
time
in
the
mouth
at
times
you
feel
like
its
gonna
escape
your
pursed
lips
while
there
is
an
underlying
astringency
here
you
get
a
lot
more
caramel
toffee
creamed
coffee
as
well
as
cocoa
roast
the
grains
turn
towards
country
style
bread
and
biscuits
less
herbal
here
you
get
a
splash
of
grapefruit
and
sour
orange
alongside
the
more
saline
aspect
stains
the
palate
deeply
you
can
taste
it
fully
long
after
youve
swallowed
wellcrafted
and
unique
in
subtle
ways
very
flavorful
quite
drinkable
took
me
awhile
to
get
to
this
one
because
i
thought
it
wouldnt
be
very
interesting
i
was
wrong
o
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
amber
heavierthicker
than
some
that
ive
had
which
is
a
plus
but
less
hoppiness
than
others
is
a
let
down
other
than
that
i
find
this
one
mildly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
really
great
amber
ale
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
any
time
of
year
i
love
yuengling
which
is
probably
the
most
widely
distributed
american
red
ale
but
this
american
amberred
ale
blows
it
out
of
the
water
very
good
worth
grabbing
this
pours
a
very
light
brown
almost
an
amber
with
very
little
head
to
it
this
has
a
great
initial
smell
its
malt
heavy
but
not
overly
sweet
theres
just
a
hint
of
something
darker
in
the
smell
maybe
coffee
damn
thats
the
first
word
out
of
my
mouth
when
i
took
a
sip
it
tingles
the
taste
buds
in
a
good
way
just
enough
hop
edge
to
remind
you
youre
drinking
a
beer
very
tasty
although
a
great
one
off
this
doesnt
go
down
hot
and
heavy
a
good
sipper
to
have
on
hand
when
needed
when
at
the
liquor
store
i
often
pass
up
rogue
because
of
the
cost
and
refusal
to
use
freshness
dating
this
ale
tasted
fresh
maybe
those
oxygenabsorbing
caps
advertised
by
rogue
are
the
difference
rogues
american
amber
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
and
if
they
wanted
more
balance
more
sweeter
malt
should
have
been
noticed
i
really
like
this
amber
although
it
is
not
at
all
an
adventurous
beer
for
these
guys
pours
a
fluffy
headed
dusty
brick
color
aroma
of
toasted
nuts
and
american
barley
no
sweetness
at
all
in
the
taste
which
i
absolutely
love
just
good
balanced
and
complex
malts
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
an
awesome
bright
finish
as
ambers
go
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
although
ive
head
its
much
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
tap
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
ambers
ive
had
recently
good
balance
i
enjoyed
the
hop
profile
i
would
gladly
recommend
deliciously
balanced
beer
without
a
lack
of
excitement
amber
in
appearance
nice
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
a
good
hoppy
mouth
feel
is
hoppy
with
a
good
body
and
a
nice
bitterness
the
taste
is
very
close
to
a
pale
ale
overall
this
is
a
fridge
worthy
beer
will
go
with
any
food
you
like
we
feel
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
overall
fairly
unique
i
like
the
more
ipa
notes
of
this
amber
ale
which
maintains
its
amber
roots
o
a
great
beer
beautiful
in
appearance
and
the
nose
is
wonderful
but
the
taste
disappointed
a
bit
a
little
tart
for
a
red
ale
but
still
great
o
would
never
turn
a
rogue
beer
away
ever
this
one
no
exception
all
are
quite
welcome
to
the
palate
o
this
beer
looks
really
nice
but
it
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
on
all
the
other
factors
too
bitter
for
an
amber
and
not
enough
malt
flavor
in
there
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
contradiction
wonderful
inviting
smell
but
a
bit
of
a
harsh
flavor
it
had
some
very
good
qualities
though
overall
not
too
impressed
by
this
one
a
good
beer
im
enjoying
having
a
good
supply
in
my
fridge
ambers
often
are
my
lighter
dinner
beer
that
i
enjoy
with
food
where
this
beer
doesnt
fit
that
bill
quite
as
well
the
complexity
and
body
make
it
stand
on
its
own
87
this
pours
out
a
real
nice
amber
red
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
away
fast
has
a
hoppy
smell
with
malty
hints
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
this
is
a
light
to
medium
brew
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
real
good
amber
but
probably
not
the
best
out
there
overall
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
it
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
it
definitely
has
a
lot
of
flavor
i
would
like
to
try
other
varieties
by
this
brewer
overall
tasty
nice
hop
character
but
with
a
good
malt
balance
overal
a
good
brew
not
one
of
my
favourites
though
this
is
a
solid
take
on
the
american
amber
style
from
rogue
with
an
even
mix
of
hops
and
sweetness
and
then
some
more
roasted
character
emerging
to
keep
this
interesting
this
wasnt
the
most
full
flavored
example
of
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
but
it
got
the
job
done
o
overall
a
solid
beer
not
a
slap
your
momma
good
beer
but
very
drinkable
could
easily
down
23
in
a
sitting
pours
out
with
the
good
look
of
an
amber
good
head
slowly
dissolving
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
hops
is
very
strong
in
it
some
malt
hints
as
well
the
taste
is
highly
imbalanced
leading
to
the
hops
with
a
very
earthydirt
taste
overall
quite
a
bit
unpleasant
and
though
i
like
other
rogue
beer
i
wouldnt
really
get
this
one
again
o
very
good
beer
that
would
be
great
anytime
of
year
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
crisp
and
refreshing
to
the
palate
this
is
a
decent
outdoorsy
kind
of
beer
drinkability
is
ok
but
if
it
just
had
a
bit
more
hops
it
could
be
great
overall
very
pleased
wasnt
expecting
that
much
hoppy
flavor
from
an
amber
but
it
was
nicely
done
a
decent
brew
that
doesnt
really
lend
itself
to
categorization
or
a
recommendation
for
a
drinker
other
than
its
relative
sessionable
quality
poured
a
dark
cloudy
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aroma
of
caramel
malts
mostly
bready
with
a
hint
of
piney
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
nice
toasty
caramel
malts
bready
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
following
and
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
mediumbodied
and
quite
drinkable
smooth
and
nonthreatening
to
even
the
weak
of
heart
m
a
newbie
when
it
comes
to
this
thing
just
a
nice
all
around
full
bodied
amber
ale
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
beer
after
tasting
it
beautfiul
amber
color
and
shade
of
red
smell
is
a
very
mildly
hoppy
sent
taste
is
great
with
a
nice
hopped
finished
something
to
try
if
your
not
a
hop
head
or
just
trying
to
develop
a
taste
for
it
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
that
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
an
english
ipa
the
flavours
were
well
balanced
and
it
was
very
drinkable
its
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
o
very
good
beer
with
a
touch
less
hops
you
could
taste
more
malt
though
and
would
make
this
beer
exceptional
easy
drinking
well
hopped
red
nice
amber
color
with
a
solid
head
nice
coning
and
lacing
taste
was
a
bit
off
mouth
feel
like
a
maltier
ale
taste
more
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
bitter
and
offputting
after
each
sip
i
thought
it
would
get
better
once
food
arrived
but
it
made
everything
taste
worse
the
bitterness
stuck
with
me
for
quite
a
wile
i
like
hops
but
dont
like
a
sharp
bitter
taste
to
linger
for
a
long
time
i
would
not
get
this
beer
again
not
really
sure
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
beer
but
when
i
think
of
red
ales
i
think
of
a
milder
tasting
less
offensive
beer
nice
session
beer
pours
a
completely
opaque
amberorange
looks
like
apple
cider
a
tannish
ring
spackles
the
glass
with
froth
smell
is
dank
slightly
fruity
and
ripe
taste
quickly
turns
from
earthy
malts
to
a
bitter
grassy
twang
strong
hints
of
grapefruit
with
a
bit
of
lemon
yes
this
is
unexpected
hoppiness
for
an
amber
feel
is
very
carbonated
and
aftertastes
of
grapefruit
again
ok
beer
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
o
while
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
it
doesnt
grow
on
you
would
i
order
this
in
a
bar
yes
would
i
buy
a
six
pack
at
total
wine
no
the
only
disappointment
was
the
appearance
just
not
very
much
lace
and
head
this
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
amber
ale
and
yet
another
winner
from
rogue
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
most
of
the
smell
and
taste
was
sweet
malt
pretty
good
this
beer
is
great
especially
for
a
session
ale
light
and
hoppy
and
makes
for
a
good
meal
ale
overall
complex
enough
to
stay
interesting
too
hoppy
to
be
truly
sessionable
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
of
these
by
the
pool
after
working
in
the
yard
or
with
a
spicy
dinner
as
the
weather
starts
to
warm
i
can
see
this
beer
spending
a
lot
of
time
with
me
on
the
front
porch
easy
drinking
but
with
plenty
of
interest
and
a
very
refined
profile
good
stuff
drinkability
another
fine
beer
from
rogue
solid
well
balanced
easily
drinkable
would
go
well
during
any
season
not
overly
complex
or
robust
one
that
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
drinkability
very
good
i
had
been
having
too
many
weizenbiers
lately
and
the
hops
here
were
a
very
refreshing
change
this
is
one
i
will
be
revisiting
again
soon
d
very
good
its
not
a
major
session
beer
but
this
is
a
great
craft
beer
only
good
things
from
rogue
overall
really
nicely
done
not
a
knockout
but
very
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
still
worth
another
try
d
gentle
delicious
flavor
keeps
you
sipping
rock
solid
beer
dont
know
why
i
dont
have
this
more
often
d
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
great
beer
has
a
nice
warm
feel
when
drinking
this
very
pleasant
in
all
aspects
all
in
all
it
is
alright
but
i
would
appreciate
more
balance
from
a
22oz
bottle
to
a
imperial
pint
pours
an
opaque
amberbrown
color
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
the
head
is
pretty
impressive
on
this
beer
the
retention
is
great
and
it
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
slowly
recedes
to
a
splotchy
layer
on
top
of
my
beer
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
the
smell
did
not
impress
me
as
much
the
nose
is
a
warm
malty
smell
that
is
sort
of
nutty
the
taste
starts
malty
and
finishes
with
an
odd
bitterness
not
odd
in
a
bad
way
just
different
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
pretty
decent
beer
with
an
acceptable
abv
the
beer
tastes
malty
with
a
fruity
start
and
charcoalbittersweet
finish
its
a
lighter
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
beer
poured
a
cloudy
sweettea
color
a
weak
thin
head
possessed
very
little
retention
aroma
of
tart
cherries
with
semisweet
cocoa
a
very
interesting
flavor
woody
peat
bitter
dandelion
midtaste
nutty
with
a
touch
of
charcoal
mouthfeel
revealed
medium
high
carbonation
light
body
somewhat
astringent
overall
this
was
in
interesting
and
unique
brew
doverall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
it
looks
great
one
of
the
best
in
a
while
good
maltyness
to
this
great
example
of
the
american
ale
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
orangish
hue
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
citrus
grapefruity
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
then
ends
with
a
caramel
sweetness
the
beer
is
a
medium
light
mouthfeel
i
would
say
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
hits
the
amber
style
on
the
head
great
caramel
sweetness
balanced
well
with
american
hops
aroma
is
average
but
the
wonderful
blend
of
malts
and
hops
make
this
the
most
drinkablesession
worthy
rogue
ive
come
across
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
cant
say
how
old
my
bottle
is
but
im
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
older
because
only
a
handful
of
people
are
noting
the
metallic
taste
if
only
rogue
would
date
their
bottles
this
could
be
a
great
beer
and
im
very
much
willing
to
try
it
again
to
see
if
i
had
an
older
bottle
nice
look
with
clear
amber
color
with
and
foamy
tan
head
that
soon
faded
and
mild
lacing
a
light
coffee
aroma
and
not
much
carbonation
a
light
sour
accent
mild
hops
and
a
smooth
dry
finish
very
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorites
d
id
like
more
hops
to
it
pretty
bland
overall
flavor
not
one
of
the
better
ambers
ive
had
but
ive
also
had
worse
d
pretty
tasty
friend
had
a
cooler
of
these
for
the
afternoon
i
wouldnt
say
no
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
colour
with
a
head
that
doesnt
last
that
long
i
smell
some
is
very
weak
i
got
almost
nothing
from
it
served
too
cold
the
flavour
of
this
beer
starts
out
malty
then
becomes
hoppy
with
some
really
nice
fruitiness
the
finish
is
really
smooth
no
bitterness
condition
since
the
beer
was
brewed
in
2002
this
is
probably
more
of
an
issue
than
it
normally
would
be
but
i
can
report
that
all
of
the
several
hundred
bottles
were
in
perfect
highlydrinkable
condition
and
thats
not
just
my
opinion
its
echoed
by
friends
and
family
who
have
shared
in
the
oregon
bounty
i
dont
know
enough
about
the
beer
to
suggest
that
its
taken
on
an
extra
level
of
complexity
and
maturity
in
its
vintage
state
but
its
either
that
or
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
right
out
of
the
gate
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
moderate
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
earthy
malts
nice
but
nothing
special
taste
is
average
nice
earthy
malts
and
maybe
a
slight
citrus
slightly
watery
though
in
my
mind
though
easily
drinkable
a
nice
light
amber
but
nothing
special
d
good
beer
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
worst
amber
ale
overall
this
was
pretty
drinkable
and
a
prety
good
solid
beer
but
not
great
a
bit
boring
with
too
much
bitter
grapefruit
lingering
in
the
finish
along
with
crackers
amberbrown
in
color
with
a
dense
foamy
head
that
persisted
for
the
life
of
the
22
oz
bottle
coffee
and
malt
aromas
that
carry
through
to
the
flavors
which
are
initially
bitter
coffee
and
smoky
malt
this
was
followed
by
a
rather
unpleasant
metallic
aftertaste
that
could
be
quickly
washed
away
with
another
sip
but
nevertheless
was
unpleasant
and
distracting
medium
to
light
in
body
with
good
drinkability
it
was
a
good
companion
to
some
corned
beef
cabbage
and
soda
bread
aroma
is
strong
fruity
malty
and
a
bit
yeasty
rather
inviting
it
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
copperyamber
with
a
thick
fluffy
creamwhite
head
flavor
is
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
undertone
and
hints
of
fruit
mainly
apple
texture
is
very
smooth
yet
it
leaves
behind
a
pleasant
tingle
and
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
as
well
as
a
little
fruity
sweetness
another
winner
from
rogue
drinkability
dont
know
if
id
call
this
one
sessionable
but
that
might
just
be
me
i
imagine
it
can
be
a
good
session
beer
but
i
enjoyed
taking
my
time
with
it
rarely
do
i
consider
brown
or
amber
ales
very
drinkable
but
this
one
is
drinkability
could
drink
a
6
pack
no
problem
not
too
high
abv
but
a
great
aroma
and
taste
will
make
me
look
for
this
again
in
the
future
not
empty
not
watery
not
light
none
of
those
are
bad
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
sting
to
the
carbonation
though
drinkability
not
so
sure
about
the
style
of
this
beer
i
would
classify
this
as
an
esb
or
american
bitter
either
way
its
a
decent
effort
from
rogue
a
pleasantly
drinkable
rendition
of
an
american
amber
ale
nothing
really
standing
out
to
make
it
particularly
memorable
but
thats
a
style
limitation
for
the
most
part
this
is
the
sixer
that
you
lug
to
a
summer
bbq
hoping
that
someone
else
brings
something
equal
or
better
for
tradesies
yet
you
remain
smugly
satisfied
if
they
dont
fairly
drinkable
although
this
is
no
session
beer
a
welldone
beer
id
have
this
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
american
amber
well
done
beer
to
drink
with
pleasure
drinkability
i
will
buy
this
again
for
sure
all
that
being
said
this
beer
is
way
to
expensive
here
in
alberta
at
22
for
6
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
too
often
if
i
had
lots
of
money
this
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
but
i
dont
have
much
moola
so
this
is
a
treat
for
now
d
very
good
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
as
a
routine
buy
the
body
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
and
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
drinkability
however
is
still
good
a
solid
american
amber
that
i
could
enjoy
anytime
poured
a
hearty
auburn
brown
with
a
good
dry
malt
smell
that
contained
some
sweetness
like
caramel
in
it
not
a
typical
red
as
the
hop
presence
is
really
pronounced
and
gives
off
a
dry
almost
pale
ale
vibe
with
the
crisp
backbite
but
really
enjoyable
and
does
contain
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malt
as
well
the
caramelsugariness
is
pronounced
in
the
middle
of
this
beer
and
there
is
a
roasted
presence
in
the
finish
maybe
a
bit
harder
for
those
who
like
traditionalmild
amber
ales
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
d
rogue
is
very
good
and
making
drinkable
beers
like
dead
guy
this
is
just
a
superbly
balanced
beer
that
is
not
too
heavy
malty
hoppy
or
alcohol
filled
that
it
exercises
your
taste
buds
or
liver
too
much
great
beer
that
lots
of
people
enjoy
i
liked
the
malty
and
slightly
bitter
taste
its
a
good
session
beer
id
recommend
this
to
hopheads
and
novices
pours
amber
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
and
caramel
malt
with
some
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
quite
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
the
hops
are
strong
at
the
end
you
also
get
some
toffee
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
the
beer
has
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
but
nothing
spectacular
dry
hopping
is
the
key
to
its
success
not
only
did
i
taste
the
dry
hopping
but
also
smelled
it
as
soon
as
i
pour
it
into
a
glass
the
body
is
beautiful
love
rubby
red
color
when
put
it
under
the
light
as
i
have
said
the
dry
hopping
gives
this
beer
so
many
characters
to
review
but
they
are
all
beyond
my
words
drink
it
slowly
and
enjoy
it
this
wasnt
awful
but
certainly
not
great
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
unremarkable
i
much
prefer
the
other
rogue
beers
i
have
tried
dead
guy
ale
and
mocha
porter
and
dont
plan
on
buying
this
again
overall
american
amber
ale
is
another
welldone
beer
put
forward
from
the
ladies
and
gents
at
rogue
pretty
damn
drinkable
no
matter
what
the
occasion
this
is
just
a
tasty
ale
this
beer
pours
beautifully
great
dark
amber
color
with
nice
thick
amber
almost
orange
head
the
lacing
was
long
lasting
as
well
im
not
that
big
a
fan
of
ambers
but
of
the
ones
ive
had
lately
this
ranks
pretty
high
bitter
going
down
bitter
aftertaste
but
the
aftertaste
goes
away
pretty
quickly
i
rated
it
low
on
drinkability
just
because
i
am
not
too
much
of
a
fan
of
the
hoppy
beers
but
for
what
this
one
is
i
would
say
its
one
of
the
best
around
all
around
a
well
balanced
beer
not
too
complex
in
terms
of
flavors
but
the
taste
works
well
and
fill
you
up
definitely
a
good
brew
for
a
chilly
evening
with
a
hearty
dinner
cheers
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
smooth
rich
and
flavoursome
without
being
overwhelming
nice
solid
and
enjoyable
offering
from
rogue
can
drink
plenty
of
this
not
bad
overall
could
have
been
better
overall
a
solid
offering
from
rogue
the
citrus
hop
presence
is
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
of
the
various
malts
nothing
overly
special
about
this
one
but
still
a
tasty
treat
feel
was
pretty
dry
a
bit
watery
and
thin
imo
carbonation
and
hops
gave
it
a
nice
crisp
bite
dryness
and
light
body
make
it
really
drinkable
definitely
sessionable
it
pours
a
nice
little
amber
haze
with
small
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
of
hops
and
caramel
while
the
initial
taste
is
hoppy
up
front
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
that
really
started
to
come
out
after
this
warmed
up
a
bit
the
body
seemed
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
even
for
a
amber
ale
which
improves
drinkability
even
more
all
in
all
a
pretty
decent
amber
nothing
too
special
dry
finish
with
some
slight
hop
notes
d
this
was
a
nice
style
i
expected
the
hops
to
linger
around
some
more
i
liked
the
role
reversal
once
the
beer
changed
temperatures
a
rogue
classic
that
must
be
sampled
taste
is
smooth
slightly
bitter
and
slightly
sweet
malt
grain
caramel
corn
and
hops
ends
a
little
bitter
has
a
thick
head
and
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
has
a
nice
smell
some
detectable
caramel
aroma
i
dont
have
the
most
advanced
olfactory
skill
so
i
could
be
missing
some
stuff
pretty
good
taste
some
caramel
sweet
nut
flavor
smooth
mouthfeel
but
textured
and
very
drinkable
ive
enjoyed
the
rogues
i
have
had
thus
far
but
i
dont
think
i
will
have
this
again
it
wasnt
bad
the
low
carbonation
with
the
smooth
body
makes
it
easy
to
drink
its
nice
to
see
a
beer
this
complex
compared
to
the
others
ive
tried

well
balanced
beer
decent
on
the
palate
and
a
beer
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
rogue
american
amber
ale
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
colored
head
not
much
smell
to
this
one
although
the
malt
and
hops
are
present
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
begins
smooth
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
and
finishes
with
some
tasty
hopsjust
the
right
amount
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
like
the
balance
of
this
beer
a
lot
beers
like
this
one
are
not
overly
sweet
and
do
not
slap
your
face
with
hops
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
rogue
beers
seem
to
have
a
unique
flavor
to
them
that
i
really
like
this
beer
is
one
of
their
best
and
widely
available
across
the
u
s
of
a
overall
a
classic
and
tasty
amber
drinkabilitythat
bottle
was
punished
in
minutes
drinkability
good
but
could
be
easier
well
carbonated
prickly
mouthfeel
that
contributes
to
the
bitter
hops
very
drinkable
but
the
scent
set
me
up
for
disappointment
good
introductory
brew
for
the
beer
beginner
d
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
as
sessionable
of
an
amber
as
ive
found
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
mouthfeel
is
great
and
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
recommended
if
in
the
mood
for
a
mild
hoppy
sessionable
beer
d
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
from
an
otherwise
quality
brewer
my
first
experience
with
rogue
and
im
not
that
impressed
ill
have
to
try
something
else
edit
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
yesterday
and
it
was
much
better
ill
pass
rogue
has
some
nice
beers
but
this
one
is
probably
one
thatd
be
okay
to
skip
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
amber
coloring
hence
the
name
its
got
a
nice
aroma
from
pouring
it
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
tasted
a
little
bitter
but
as
it
got
warmer
it
bite
wore
off
to
more
of
a
crisp
taste
md
was
very
pleasing
nice
sipper
or
quite
refreshing
after
an
afternoon
on
the
golf
course
a
little
pricy
but
ive
seen
it
less
expensive
at
bigger
stores
3
5
d
sometimes
seems
miraculous
other
times
mediocre
sometimes
the
bitterness
strikes
me
as
too
much
sometimes
the
sweetness
pops
up
as
sickening
after
several
sixpacks
over
the
last
year
or
so
still
havent
figured
it
out
most
of
rogues
offerings
are
without
a
doubt
worthwhile
heck
they
make
some
of
the
best
out
there
however
once
in
a
while
they
miss
and
i
think
this
is
what
you
have
here
yes
this
is
without
a
doubt
an
amber
it
pours
a
nearly
pictureperfect
amber
color
but
thats
the
best
thing
going
for
it
nice
aroma
slight
hops
and
maybe
a
touch
of
caramel
good
flavor
but
nothing
that
would
make
me
want
to
buy
it
again
not
a
disappointment
but
didnt
come
close
to
my
very
high
expectations
for
a
rogue
amber
poured
out
a
cross
between
dark
brown
and
red
nice
frothy
head
smelled
terrific
citrusy
flavors
and
toasted
nutty
tones
taste
was
a
bit
overwhelming
on
the
one
hand
there
were
the
toasted
earthy
flavors
then
there
was
the
citrus
maybe
lemon
maybe
grapefruit
flavors
as
well
in
my
opinion
just
a
bit
too
allovertheplace
for
me
it
lacked
a
focal
flavor
d
5
6
abv
this
one
could
be
had
again
and
again
im
ready
to
try
more
of
rogues
selection
id
be
willing
to
give
this
brew
another
go
in
a
few
months
at
which
point
i
would
review
it
again
with
a
clear
mind
of
what
this
one
left
me
with
a
pretty
good
very
drinkable
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
foamy
offwhite
head
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
subtle
with
traces
of
hops
and
some
malt
slight
roasted
malt
flavor
with
caramel
some
hops
and
a
bitter
finish
nice
all
around
beer
also
what
a
beautiful
and
patriotic
label
this
is
a
solid
beer
one
to
enjoy
but
not
to
shock
you
or
surprise
you
d
for
me
rogue
can
be
hit
or
miss
but
wow
did
i
enjoy
this
beer
drinkability
is
fairly
high
great
flavor
and
low
alcohol
make
this
beer
easily
consumed
easily
sessionable
and
quite
enjoyable
my
local
beer
store
was
featuring
this
recently
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
it
seemed
like
a
good
bet
based
on
other
beers
ive
had
from
rogue
turns
out
the
american
amber
is
whelming
nice
color
similar
to
other
amber
or
copper
beer
such
as
otter
creeks
amber
ale
with
a
decent
but
not
great
head
a
nice
pile
of
upfront
maltiness
before
the
hops
hit
and
bitterness
similar
to
an
ipa
but
much
creamier
more
malt
at
the
back
end
to
balance
the
bitterness
still
it
had
more
fizz
than
flavor
which
hit
the
spot
with
a
pizza
but
i
was
expecting
something
less
pedestrian
an
average
offering
from
an
aboveaverage
brewery
this
is
my
second
offering
from
rogue
my
first
one
was
a
draft
beer
the
brewerys
offerings
seemed
to
be
widely
lauded
but
i
cant
say
i
have
been
really
wowed
yet
maybe
my
expectations
are
too
high
pours
a
translucent
amberbrown
with
a
big
tan
head
smells
of
citrus
hops
and
carmelized
malt
taste
is
malty
juicy
pear
flavors
with
a
hint
of
toasted
malt
there
is
a
very
nice
raw
earthy
hop
flavor
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
british
bitter
bitterness
levels
match
up
perfectly
with
the
malt
balancing
things
out
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
is
slightly
high
and
prickly
very
drinkable
this
would
make
a
good
session
ale
if
it
had
a
little
less
alcohol
sez
jazz
guy
ale
on
the
label
but
whatever
appearance
is
copper
with
deep
orange
and
red
hues
and
significant
haziness
a
generous
offwhite
head
lingers
for
the
duration
aroma
is
interesting
very
faint
flowery
and
piney
hops
plus
sweet
malt
reminding
me
of
ginger
snaps
taste
has
moderate
hop
bitterness
right
up
front
but
decent
malt
backbone
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
a
medium
full
mouthfeel
makes
this
brew
feel
smooth
on
the
tongue
despite
its
moderate
bitterness
the
more
i
drink
the
more
flavors
i
discover
and
i
find
myself
raising
my
score
for
this
beer
a
bit
more
with
each
sip
yum
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
for
an
american
ipa
and
the
color
isnt
right
but
for
better
or
worse
id
say
this
has
the
same
drinkability
as
an
ipa
very
smooth
and
goodlooking
with
solid
flavors
and
great
drinkability
rogues
amber
is
a
fine
one
that
id
drink
again
anytime
beer
is
a
deep
red
color
that
is
a
great
change
of
pace
after
so
many
golden
beers
no
haze
evident
did
not
have
an
over
powering
aroma
or
taste
tasted
a
little
bit
piny
and
was
relatively
full
bodied
after
taste
was
much
more
bitter
than
anticipated
not
a
session
beer
but
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
for
a
person
trying
to
drink
a
different
kind
of
ale
tasted
on
62708
d
drinkable
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
not
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
i
would
definitely
have
again
if
offered
this
is
a
good
drinkable
ale
though
nothing
impressive
this
was
a
really
exceptional
brew
from
rogue
the
beer
poured
with
a
somewhat
murky
amber
color
creamier
and
creamier
lacing
as
i
sipped
and
a
nice
thinned
patchy
head
great
roasted
malt
aromas
and
some
citrus
attributes
medium
on
hops
the
taste
was
great
slight
bitter
finish
to
a
warmly
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
flavors
very
dry
and
crisp
good
carbonation
that
leaves
an
awesome
finish
at
the
end
overall
rogue
does
it
again
awesome
rogue
labeling
as
usual
here
we
have
a
working
class
fella
tipping
his
cap
to
a
job
well
done
in
front
of
a
background
of
an
american
flag
a
clean
dark
amber
brew
is
topped
off
by
a
twofinger
rolling
fluffy
tan
head
smells
of
toasted
malts
hops
and
tea
the
malthop
taste
is
covered
by
a
slight
sweetness
with
some
chalkiness
at
the
end
this
is
a
lighttomedium
bodied
tasty
sessioner
that
should
appeal
the
patriotic
and
not
so
patriotic
as
well
i
am
stephens101
and
i
approve
this
message
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
ambergolden
with
an
average
offwhite
head
head
does
not
hang
around
very
long
and
dissolves
into
a
think
white
ring
around
the
top
amells
more
malty
than
anything
else
nothing
much
more
comes
to
the
front
it
tastes
good
but
theres
nothing
too
pronounced
this
is
a
wellrounded
balanced
amber
ale
a
little
bread
a
little
malt
a
little
hops
mouthfeel
is
great
doesnt
stick
to
the
sides
of
your
mouth
and
virtually
no
aftertaste
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
damned
good
as
a
side
note
these
rogue
bombers
are
a
little
pricey
what
is
essentially
two
glasses
of
beer
costs
almost
as
much
as
a
sixpack
of
some
other
decent
micros
good
finish
a
little
sweet
very
drinkable
very
tasty
very
drinkable
d
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastesid
much
prefer
to
session
with
the
dryhopped
st
rogue
red
for
an
example
of
the
same
style
from
the
same
brewery
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
my
trusty
ol
rogue
dead
guy
pint
glass
look
is
a
beautiful
dark
red
with
a
nice
clumpy
white
head
on
top
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
with
a
hopiness
in
the
back
this
brew
is
really
balanced
beautifully
nice
sweet
malts
combined
with
a
hop
bitterness
crispy
up
front
but
sweet
and
smooth
to
the
finish
a
little
bit
darker
than
a
traditional
amber
but
what
the
hell
once
again
rogue
fails
to
disappoint
easy
to
drink
and
im
a
sucker
for
the
malt
smoothness
drinkability
yummy
had
the
growler
all
to
myself
another
great
offering
from
a
darn
good
brewery
this
is
a
beer
that
begs
not
to
be
analyzed
just
to
be
consumed
in
decent
quantities
tasty
goes
down
nicely
a
very
well
done
beer
without
being
extreme
or
standoutish
in
any
way
d
good
flavor
good
balance
good
mouthfeel
good
aroma
good
all
around
would
make
a
great
session
beer
god
bless
america
overall
a
great
beer
that
could
go
well
with
just
about
anything
d
the
tang
and
metal
sour
hop
taste
kept
it
from
a
four
but
this
is
a
good
fucking
beer
try
one
on
for
size
fits
like
a
peanutbutter
sandwich
final
thoughts
has
an
earthy
tea
like
quality
very
nice
brew
one
definately
a
west
coast
brew
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
you
really
never
know
which
direction
a
brewer
is
going
to
take
an
amber
ale
will
it
be
hoppy
or
malty
this
is
a
very
hoppy
take
on
the
style
to
where
it
tastes
like
an
apa
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
as
this
beer
is
big
and
full
flavoured
which
is
what
rogue
do
best
the
hops
are
anchored
by
a
nice
malt
backbone
this
is
a
great
rogue
brew
drinkability
this
beer
is
good
for
sipping
over
time
or
for
swallowing
in
bigger
mouthfuls
it
is
a
little
strong
for
an
amber
but
it
is
extremely
enjoyable
in
its
own
rights
excellent
the
taste
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
overall
it
matches
the
smell
in
its
great
balance
i
would
describe
this
beer
as
having
a
unique
but
totally
accessible
flavor
that
even
the
uninitiated
should
appreciate
nice
medium
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
i
havent
had
a
bad
rogue
beer
ill
definitely
be
getting
this
again
not
very
drinkable
for
an
amber
again
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
pours
a
very
nice
dark
opaque
copper
with
great
head
and
nice
lacing
very
sweet
scent
a
little
tartsour
like
an
irish
red
nice
balanced
taste
begins
with
a
nice
malt
and
ends
with
a
great
hop
finish
goes
down
extremely
smooth
very
good
beer
d
drinkability
is
good
given
the
low
abv
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
worth
a
try
good
carbonation
and
a
hoppedup
finish
help
make
this
a
really
good
pick
really
good
stuff
another
fine
offering
from
rogue
i
have
gotten
cases
of
this
from
costco
during
the
summer
its
really
great
on
a
camping
trip
or
as
a
session
sipper
rogue
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
may
be
my
least
favorite
of
their
beers
and
yet
i
still
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
bomber
poured
into
my
rogue
pint
glass
perfect
amber
color
and
a
nice
onefinger
head
toasty
malt
aromas
with
a
sizable
hop
presence
flavor
includes
a
bready
malt
character
with
a
chocolate
tinge
hops
are
citrusy
with
a
light
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
good
but
drinkability
is
hindered
by
a
metallic
note
that
becomes
increasingly
prominent
with
warmth
taste
is
immediately
hoppy
not
overwhelming
in
the
hop
bitterness
but
quite
a
surprise
as
the
aroma
didnt
reveal
how
strong
the
hop
presence
would
be
long
lingering
bitterness
if
i
ddint
know
better
id
almost
think
this
was
a
lager
pretty
tasty
but
nothing
outstanding
d
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
an
ideal
session
brew
imo
recommended
d
umm
not
a
fan
of
amber
ales
never
really
liked
them
but
being
rogue
i
wanted
to
give
theirs
a
try
its
descent
but
its
not
something
i
will
purchase
again
would
have
liked
more
malt
character
and
maybe
a
little
sweetness
and
less
lingering
hoppiness
drinkability
its
no
st
rogue
thats
for
sure
but
its
not
bad
a
pleasant
sipper
but
not
the
most
interesting
one
yummy
with
parmesan
yearold
cheddar
wasabi
gouda
but
surprisingly
bad
with
aged
gouda
as
stated
before
the
initial
mouthfeel
was
quite
sharp
but
it
then
ended
with
an
almost
smoothing
texture
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
but
otherwise
it
is
a
very
solid
brew
i
would
not
be
able
to
session
this
beer
at
this
point
but
i
could
see
it
growing
on
me
in
time
final
note
god
bless
our
troops
650

patriotic
red
white
and
blue
rogue
bottle
copped
for
about
5

from
total
wine
and
more
in
union
pours
a
darkbrown
mahogany
and
copper
appearance
with
a
foamy
and
frothy
head
that
soon
receded
smell
was
laden
with
hops
caramel
and
vanilla
taste
strongly
complemented
the
aroma
flavor
was
very
good
for
an
american
amber
albeit
a
little
less
intense
than
some
stronger
abv
samples
for
example
compared
to
southern
tiers
big
red
this
sample
paled
in
comparison
with
regards
to
flavor
and
character
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
an
excellent
depiction
of
the
style
with
the
typical
rogue
quality
very
apparent
and
a
strong
crisp
clean
and
clear
mouthfeel
with
excellent
drinkability
due
to
the
relatively
modest
5
6
abv
a
good
sample
recommended
pours
a
cloudy
pinkish
copper
under
a
thick
1
5
finger
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
bubbleholes
but
great
contour
and
very
nice
lacing
moderately
strong
nose
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
nuts
the
mouth
is
rather
heavy
and
moderately
carbonated
nicely
balanced
taste
with
lots
of
malt
standing
off
against
an
undertone
of
dry
spicey
hops
the
aftertaste
brings
on
a
special
dry
bitter
kick
but
the
sweet
grain
never
fully
succombs
very
quaffable
drinkability
one
of
the
classics
and
a
highly
drinkable
brew
its
not
going
to
blow
you
away
with
its
originality
but
its
solid
all
around
drinkability
its
hard
to
swallow
in
big
gulps
but
whod
want
to
anyway
i
found
myself
at
the
bottom
of
this
quite
enjoyable
quintessential
american
brew
in
about
3
minutes
ill
take
another
and
would
love
to
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
grilling
some
burgers
and
brats
aroma
is
malty
with
bread
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
also
some
light
flowery
and
citrus
hops
and
some
licorice
offwhite
head
is
average
sized
and
disappears
lacing
is
good
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
to
medium
red
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
sort
of
an
ipa
flavor
profile
with
a
bitter
finish
something
in
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
off
pretty
good
all
the
same
drinkability
is
not
to
bad
a
pretty
good
pnw
amber
with
no
flaws
and
pretty
light
for
a
decent
abv
not
my
personal
favorite
but
a
good
tranisiton
to
the
hops
out
here
for
the
uninitiated
d
an
ok
amber
ale
it
started
off
good
for
me
but
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
there
really
wasnt
anything
to
make
me
come
back
to
a
great
hoppy
brew
this
one
is
really
good
i
like
the
full
bodied
nature
of
this
ale
and
the
abundant
presence
of
hops
i
especially
like
the
hops
in
reading
the
description
from
the
website
im
not
sure
where
the
coffee
description
came
from
as
i
really
didnt
get
any
sense
of
coffee
in
the
brew
what
i
did
get
was
a
very
satisfying
full
bodied
clean
tasting
hoppy
brew
that
i
could
drink
with
regularity
fantastic
d
overall
a
decently
good
hopped
amber
with
good
drinkability
this
is
a
good
ale
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
it
reminds
me
of
an
american
ale
i
brewed
once
if
this
is
your
style
i
think
that
this
is
a
respectable
brew
and
certainly
worth
your
time
even
if
it
isnt
your
style
reviewed
a
loooong
time
ago
needs
a
rerate
eventually
orangeish
reddish
amber
color
with
offwhite
medium
head
mostly
hoppy
floral
and
some
slight
malt
smells
with
some
rye
like
odor
too
that
im
not
big
on
taste
is
hoppy
fruity
but
dry
and
overly
bitter
with
a
similar
lasting
aftertaste
unbalanced
to
me
was
ok
at
first
but
got
harder
and
harder
to
drink
i
can
see
hop
lovers
liking
this
still
but
far
from
one
of
my
favorites
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
slightly
higher
carbonation
creating
a
crisp
rather
than
creamy
beer
that
finishes
dry
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
excellent
with
poultry
and
beef
however
it
isnt
one
that
id
buy
again
for
the
hell
of
it
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
however
ill
definitely
be
pairing
this
with
some
steak
or
chicken
next
time
ive
that
on
the
menu
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
rich
amber
with
good
carb
and
lacing
it
had
a
2
finger
beige
head
that
slowly
whittled
down
to
a
constant
foam
cap
the
aroma
was
mostly
floral
hops
with
citrus
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
very
good
had
a
nice
hop
bite
to
go
with
the
good
base
flavor
good
bitterness
that
fades
perfectly
before
the
next
pull
mouthfeel
was
solid
and
creamy
overall
its
another
solid
effort
from
rogue
and
highly
recommend
i
can
see
this
one
getting
a
call
from
the
dugout
every
so
often
occasional
rotation
pours
a
clouded
ruby
amber
nose
is
slight
pine
scents
with
a
caramel
touch
flavor
is
bitter
at
first
like
eating
some
wild
tree
or
something
if
that
makes
sense
i
just
imagine
biting
into
something
alive
and
growing
in
a
forest
and
getting
this
not
entirely
pleasant
flavor
off
it
as
time
goes
on
it
smooth
out
a
bit
but
still
retains
that
bitter
edge
feel
is
nice
good
level
of
bubble
and
a
slightly
thicker
liquid
feel
overall
pretty
drinkable
the
bitterness
takes
away
from
it
a
good
bit
but
still
it
is
decent
enough
i
typically
dont
care
for
rogues
12oz
offerings
but
this
is
a
definate
exception
a
stellar
brews
and
pretty
sessionable
if
youre
wanting
a
little
more
hops
than
a
standard
amber
i
picked
up
this
bottle
at
3
cellars
liquor
in
franklin
wi
d
a
damn
fine
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
but
really
this
is
overhopped
for
an
amber
ale
i
probably
would
have
given
this
even
higher
marks
if
it
was
called
a
pale
ale
or
something
but
this
although
outstandingly
delicious
lacks
the
easy
drinking
malty
amber
ale
flavors
i
have
trouble
understanding
what
is
good
about
rogue
ive
had
their
dead
guy
ale
and
it
wasnt
anything
special
ive
had
their
chocolate
stout
again
nothing
special
they
burned
their
barley
an
now
the
american
amber
again
nothing
noteworthy
i
have
a
shakespeare
stout
still
hopefully
that
is
a
little
better
than
the
rest
of
the
rogue
beers
ive
had
drinkability
is
okay
not
impressive
but
alright
good
drinkabilty
as
with
just
about
everything
rogue
offers
this
is
not
the
best
they
have
yet
was
it
enjoyable
and
something
id
revisit
once
in
a
while
drinkability
a
decent
amber
ale
tried
this
beer
ontap
at
the
portland
rogue
brewpub
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
flavors
and
aromas
are
nicely
balanced
not
an
amazing
beer
but
a
great
example
of
a
session
good
malty
center
like
you
would
expect
from
an
amber
ale
with
a
clean
hoppy
finish
good
carbonation
and
head
retention
highly
drinkable
again
a
great
session
beer
offereing
from
rogue
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
the
sweet
malt
is
well
balanced
with
the
bitter
hops
it
leaves
with
just
a
bit
of
fruityness
finishes
clean
and
crisp
with
a
light
body
and
good
carbonation
this
is
much
more
than
i
expected
in
an
american
amber
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
edit
after
going
through
a
couple
more
of
these
here
in
china
i
guess
im
toning
down
my
original
review
also
several
bottles
ended
up
being
gushers
when
opened
d
4
overall
above
average
still
cant
place
what
doesnt
quite
seem
right
about
this
almost
a
slight
metallic
twinge
to
the
aftertaste
one
i
would
like
to
return
to
in
the
future
shame
about
my
bizarre
overcarbonation
problem
though
only
one
in
the
batch
out
of
the
bottle
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
an
inch
head
there
wasnt
a
strong
smell
that
i
could
detect
which
belied
the
fullbodied
taste
it
has
a
taste
that
hit
my
palate
with
malts
and
what
seemed
a
little
like
corn
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
bite
with
an
aftertaste
that
seemed
a
little
grainy
and
not
altogether
pleasant
there
is
light
carbonation
and
overall
i
would
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
knocking
back
more
than
one
at
a
time
on
a
lazy
afternoon
the
american
amber
comes
in
a
patriotic
painted
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
strong
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smells
of
deep
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
toastiness
of
malts
and
a
nice
caramel
finish
it
has
a
slight
hoppiness
to
it
very
nice
rendition
of
the
style
md
slightly
high
on
carbonation
but
incredibly
drinkable
medium
bodied
good
mouthfeel
smooth
finish
overall
another
outstanding
brew
from
rogue
so
well
balanced
and
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
stocked
up
on
a
few
more
of
these
rogue
does
quality
work
and
it
shows
with
this
fine
offering
i
know
this
one
has
a
couple
of
years
on
it
and
it
is
stil
drinking
completely
well
d
very
drinkable
would
go
well
with
a
meal
of
red
meat
and
potatoes
or
by
itself
a
beautiful
hazy
dark
orangeamber
brew
with
a
healthy
head
of
foam
very
subtle
malt
and
hop
aromas
in
the
nose
some
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
its
at
the
start
and
the
hops
kick
in
quick
for
a
bittersweet
middle
and
a
dryish
finish
pumpkin
fruitinessor
is
that
a
vegetable
carbonation
tingles
the
tongue
with
an
ale
smoothness
another
quality
ale
from
rogue
will
be
great
with
bbq
or
roasted
meats
seems
more
an
alt
beer
than
an
american
style
amber
because
of
the
roasted
and
toasted
qualities
this
is
a
gorgeous
beer
ive
got
thick
lacing
and
nice
red
body
the
smell
is
nice
but
forgetable
the
taste
however
hasa
smooth
caramel
malt
body
with
good
kick
of
american
citrus
hops
and
darker
roasted
notes
at
the
end
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
were
this
a
brand
new
i
might
think
it
unoriginal
but
this
is
really
a
classic
amber
ale
overall
a
great
example
of
an
amber
ale
i
wish
i
was
able
to
describe
the
taste
more
precisely
since
it
is
quite
good
but
seems
hard
to
place
to
me
nevertheless
one
of
the
smoothest
and
besttasting
amber
ales
ive
had
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
pick
if
youre
looking
for
a
milder
version
of
an
american
ipa
even
though
on
most
nights
id
choose
the
ipa
first
i
could
certainly
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
beer
in
an
evening
if
i
were
to
select
it
d
great
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
another
great
beer
from
rogue
one
of
my
favorites
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
heres
a
beer
thats
better
than
average
at
everything
but
just
doesnt
stand
out
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
its
just
a
sturdy
beer
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
sticks
around
until
your
finished
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
mediumbodied
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
pours
a
deep
amber
on
the
verge
of
a
nutty
brown
with
moderate
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
and
a
thick
beige
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
a
well
balanced
malt
and
hops
combo
with
lots
of
toasty
biscuity
malts
and
a
mix
of
earthy
and
citrus
hops
again
the
flavor
is
extremely
balanced
first
is
the
malt
with
its
breadiness
sweetness
and
toastiness
along
with
hints
of
the
fruity
esters
that
i
typically
get
from
the
pacman
yeast
followign
that
is
a
kiss
of
hops
that
echo
from
the
aroma
earth
and
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
tingly
carbonation
that
is
very
smooth
great
drinkability
and
wellbalanced
overall
good
beer
with
definite
emphasis
on
bitter
hops
tried
this
and
rogue
dead
guy
ale
and
preferred
this
redbrown
in
color
with
a
foamy
longlived
head
impressive
effort
from
rogue
tastes
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
has
good
mouthfeel
and
soft
carbonation
try
some
deep
rich
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
bubbles
on
the
edges
at
the
glass
rich
maltroasted
coffeein
the
nose
and
the
same
in
the
mouth
but
not
bitterly
so
actually
a
very
enjoyable
taste
mostly
rich
malt
with
hops
flavors
of
various
types
that
rather
than
meld
into
a
single
spice
or
fruity
flavor
actually
pop
in
and
out
almost
as
if
changing
along
the
way
down
the
glass
the
complexity
of
flavors
is
most
welcome
and
enjoyable
one
obvious
hop
note
adds
a
strange
hot
spice
that
i
cant
quite
place
it
was
present
in
some
swallows
and
didnt
seem
to
be
evident
in
others
regardless
extremely
flavorful
and
something
that
would
never
be
boring
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
yet
has
enough
character
to
be
a
good
pairing

this
one
is
a
well
done
example
in
this
rogue
i
was
disappointed
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
i
had
a
overwhelming
alcohol
taste
from
the
first
drink
of
the
22
oz
bottle
until
the
last
sip
as
a
huge
rogue
fan
i
find
it
very
hard
to
make
a
review
of
slightly
above

but
i
feel
that
if
the
consumer
does
not
wish
for
the
burned
flavor
speaking
of
the
alcohol
of
course
then
this
particular

would

also
some

nice

and
both
flavor
and
finish
a
little
bitter
one
of
more
difficult
styles
to
do
well
and
this
ranks
with
the
very
best
for
this
type
poured

a
orange

color
with
a
nice
carmel
colr

that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
smell
is
of
some
bread
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
a
nice
balance
between
bread
and
that
hop
bitterness
rogue
makes
some
good
offerings
and
this
is
also
one
of
my
favorites
good
work
this
beer
pours
a
huge
head
that
sticks
around
forever
the
smell
has
some
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
cofee
with
some
hops
taste
is
very
balanced
nice
caramelized
and
cofee
great
balance
and
a
great
beer
definetly
a
very
balanced
beer
witha
great
maltiness
and
great
hoppiness
pours
with
a
billowy
tan
head
i
almost
thought
it
was
overcarbonated
as
foam
stated
to
rise
out
of
the
bottle
when
cap
was
opened
may
have
been
due
to
just
layed
on
its
side
either
way
head
settles
quickly
leaving
a
foam
on
top
color
is
a
deep
redamber
nice
malty
nose
tastes
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
to
me
very
drinkable
another
high
quality
offering
from
rogue
22
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
solid
red
color
amber
for
the
expert
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
on
top
interestingly
opaqueclear
depending
on
your
perspective
looks
pretty
good
nose
is
mostly
sweet
malty
with
light
hop
hints
caramel
comes
through
strong
fairly
mild
overall
taste
is
again
mostly
malty
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
good
amount
of
molasses
subtle
hoppy
hints
show
up
later
but
this
is
definitely
a
malt
beer
feel
is
a
little
to
thin
for
me
with
carbonation
just
a
touch
to
high
not
bad
but
nothing
special
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
one
overall
its
definitely
not
bad
but
im
not
sure
if
it
lands
up
there
with
the
rogues
stouts
ive
had
of
late
this
ones
a
very
sweet
beer
although
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
its
tasty
although
not
really
complex
or
too
interesting
in
terms
of
the
hop
character
not
bad
a
solid
and
tasty
although
definitely
not
mindblowing
beer
thatll
have
you
coming
back
for
another
sweet
beer
or
two
the
color
is
a
deep
red
amber
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
certainly
shines
through
this
is
an
authentic
amber
that
does
not
get
caught
up
in
the
northwestern
u
s
extreme
hop
fad
drinkability
i
think
like
most
other
rogue
brews
this
one
is
excellent
very
refreshing
and
tasty
great
choice
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
hops
with
some
malts
and
pine
starts
slightly
sweet
wth
some
roasty
malts
and
finishes
with
floral
bitters
typical
amber
ale
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
very
creamy
a
good
amber
ale
but
ultimately
not
very
memorable
i
think
its
an
excellent
american
amber
example
good
beer
nothing
fancy
here
its
on
the
subtle
and
lowkey
side
but
theres
no
faulting
its
qualities
one
of
the
best
choices
you
could
make
for
a
session
beer
this
while
your
hunting
di
love
this
beer
i
think
it
is
very
appraochable
and
very
well
balanced
well
a
novice
or
pro
this
beer
is
great
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
no
apparent
flaws
save
perhaps
just
a
touch
of
astringency
at
the
end
this
screams
session
and
stands
proudly
alongside
bells
amber
and
north
coasts
red
seal
as
one
of
the
few
truly
exceptional
examples
of
a
style
that
is
full
of
hohum
selections
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
very
sessionable
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
have
rogue
american
amber
again
beautiful
amber
with
a
rich
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
affected
by
a
metallic
bite
but
are
otherwise
very
pleasant
and
rich
in
caramel
malt
the
malt
profile
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
the
mouth
is
rich
with
a
dry
but
lingering
finish
it
actually
tastes
a
bit
burnt
in
a
good
way
i
like
this
a
great
deal
and
am
going
to
continue
to
drink
it
extremely
drinkable
considering
the
depth
and
power
of
the
flavors
in
this
one
22

copper
in
color
hazy
nice
creamy
tan
head
hold
together
well
roasty
sweet
coffee
chocolate
floral
and
citrus
in
the
nose
interesting
combination
of
hops
although
it
does
start
to
creep
towards
perfumey
smooth
roasty
flavor
with
a
nice
citrusy
hop
bite
somewhat
caramel
like
but
not
overly
sweet
medium
body
carbonation
seems
slightly
lower
and
soft
some
nice
patches
of
lace
are
left
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
at
the
end
a
bit
of
fruit
comes
out
as
it
warms
very
enjoyable
oelergud
bomber
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
very
nice
dark
brown
color
that
is
accented
with
a
little
bit
of
red
accompanied
by
a
nice
pillowy
tan
head
that
slowly
goes
away
leaving
a
nice
layer
of
lace
at
the
surface
lots
sticking
to
side
as
well
smell
is
very
roasty
and
little
floral
as
well
very
inviting
taste
is
roasted
malt
up
front
with
a
hoppy
dry
finish
theres
a
little
carbonation
here
as
well
as
some
creaminess
well
balanced
this
is
quite
drinkable
nothing
objectionable
at
all
recommended
decent
on
the
tongue
but
a
fairly
average
beer
oveall
nothing
to
get
excited
about
poured
rusty
amber
bright
but
not
brilliant
seemed
to
be
a
little
cloudymurky
and
its
the
first
time
ive
had
this
in
many
years
nose
is
a
great
struggle
of
malts
biscuity
plummy
pale
and
roasted
a
bit
surprising
that
there
isnt
a
more
pronounced
hop
presence
on
the
nose
but
change
is
nice
too
yeasty
more
than
anything
else
as
i
drink
this
im
getting
to
appreciate
rogues
proprietary
pacman
yeast
strain
its
prominent
here
the
way
ringwood
is
elsewhere
but
to
a
generally
more
favorable
result
the
malt
complexity
from
the
nose
is
here
and
is
made
even
more
enjoyable
by
the
quality
of
the
yeast
notes
of
red
grapes
strawberries
ripe
golden
plums
and
more
of
that
biscuity
malt
not
altogether
dry
but
theres
some
dryness
here
to
balance
out
the
juicy
malt
rather
low
bitterness
but
nice
mildy
citric
hop
qualities
in
the
aromatics
great
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
rather
fullbodied
feeling
yet
not
overly
thick
quite
a
trick
to
pull
off
very
good
drinkability
also
next
time
i
enjoy
this
its
going
to
be
with
something
from
the
kitchen
as
this
struck
me
as
a
great
beer
to
accompany
food
this
is
good
beer
but
not
really
my
style
although
on
tap
it
could
be
quite
a
session
beer
poured
my
bottle
into
a
piny
glass
the
color
did
not
appear
amber
actually
was
a
dark
brown
with
slight
red
hue
formed
a
nice
dark
tan
head
moderate
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
strong
odor
of
hops
with
floral
accents
the
taste
was
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
came
through
at
end
of
each
sip
the
beer
was
nicely
carbonated
but
seemed
a
little
watery
in
the
mouth
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
drink
several
of
in
a
session
wow
this
is
the
ultimate
amber
ale
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
forming
a
fluffy
1
inch
head
that
left
medium
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
caramel
and
malts
the
taste
is
great
caramel
and
malts
and
finishes
with
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
is
head
and
shoulders
above
other
amber
ales
that
ive
tried
this
would
be
a
great
session
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
once
again
this
is
better
than
i
remember
it
id
be
interested
to
try
it
on
tap
d
its
an
okay
brew
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
it
is
very
interesting
pour
into
a
pint
glass
with
an
orangish
brown
color
almost
like
a
pumpkin
ale
as
far
as
looks
but
it
has
a
big
frothy
white
head
smells
nutty
with
some
malt
tastes
piney
and
malted
with
some
caramel
tones
a
little
bitter
but
very
good
feels
creamy
almost
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
enjoyable
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
good
it
smells
like
sweet
malt
caramel
and
some
hops
it
tastes
the
same
way
but
its
sweet
at
first
and
then
the
hops
take
over
in
the
finish
with
a
good
piney
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
its
pretty
well
balanced
the
drinkability
is
good
too
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
it
again
easy
drinking
amber
that
is
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
solid
amber
no
the
less
obviously
an
amber
hued
beer
decent
white
head
with
little
laces
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
maltiness
biscuits
caramel
just
a
wee
hint
of
chocolate
hops
that
counteract
the
malt
decent
brew
pretty
easy
to
put
down
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
buying
it
again
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
that
lasts
for
a
few
minutes

no
impressive
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
sweet
and
quite
inviting
the
taste
is
malty
and
robust
like
most
rogues
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
but
balanced
well
with
the
beer
this
is
a
highly
delightful
and
drinkable
beer
perhaps
one
of
rogues
easiest
to
swallow
overall
a
very
interesting
and
flavorful
amber
ale
yet
i
wish
it
did
have
a
bit
more
malt
balance
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
mainly
hops
with
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
slightly
piney
with
a
weak
backbone
of
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
full
medium
i
had
this
back
to
back
with
thier
brutal
bitter
and
i
cant
forsee
a
situation
where
i
wouldnt
prefer
the
bitter
id
could
say
they
were
both
similar
but
where
the
bitter
lacked
in
malt
the
ambers
caramel
matched
poorly
with
the
piney
hop
still
a
decent
brew
but
go
with
the
bitter
this
and
sam
adams
boston
ale
are
both
excellent
amber
ales
that
should
be
regular
staples
in
ones
fridge
for
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
is
a
smoothly
balanced
and
flavorful
brew
that
is
just
as
malted
as
it
is
hoppy
the
drinkability
is
very
high
due
to
this
excellent
flavor
profile
and
a
medium
to
light
body
it
would
compliment
a
variety
of
foods
and
is
quaffable
enough
to
qualify
as
a
session
beer
in
any
weather
simply
stated
just
a
damn
good
beer
for
all
occasions
pours
a
hazy
amberish
red
color
with
a
huge
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
really
nice
sweet
and
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
after
the
initial
taste
is
how
incredibly
balanced
this
brew
is
the
sweet
toasty
malt
is
nicely
balanced
by
a
perfect
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
brew
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
i
will
surely
purchase
this
again
in
the
future
recommended
overall
a
great
hoppy
amber
ale
with
enough
tasty
malt
background
to
back
it
up
yet
it
sorta
feels
like
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
at
times
in
fact
the
malt
could
and
should
be
more
pronounced
for
an
amber
would
add
some
great
balance
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
blend
of
citrus
hops
and
slight
fruitiness
taste
is
a
toasted
malt
sweetness
up
front
that
gives
way
to
a
generous
dose
of
citrus
hop
flavor
finish
is
dry
leaving
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
provide
a
smooth
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
for
this
one
great
session
beer
rogue
american
amber
ale
was
a
dark

the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
malty
with
some
cirtus
hops
the
taste
was
fairly
hoppy
with
plenty
of

especially
at

if
you
drinking
these
in

with
just
the

one
i
will
buy

goes
down
smooth
not
so
much
an

ale
but
a
dark
brown
amber
ale
very
nice
d
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
brew
and
could
easily
drink
34
however
the
hoppiness
is
what
led
me
to
give
it
less
than
perfect
scores
just
mho
highly
drinkable
sessionable
and
downright
tasty
this
is
one
fine
solid
brew
in
this
vast
title
of
a
style
my
first
smell
of
the
amber
ale
reminded
me
of
good
drought
beer
that
i
had
tasted
many
times
before
though
i
could
only
surmise
that
sam
adams
lager
was
somewhat
similar
the
first
taste
came
alive
with
a
bitter
cream
that
reminded
me
of
columbian
coffee
with
a
dash
of
half
and
half
the
beer
had
a
good
body
and
the
multi
textured
taste
just
kept
me
interested
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
pours
a
very
rich
and
appealing
crimson
with
a
slight
bit
of
haze
and
a
solid
foamy
head
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
caramel
a
bit
of
toffee
and
a
hint
of
spices
the
taste
is
smooth
and
tangy
with
a
bit
of
cherry
and
citrusy
flavoring
that
is
then
taken
over
by
the
perfect
addition
of
bitterness
to
prevent
it
from
being
overlysweet
very
well
done
very
vibrant
the
balane
is
very
nice
in
the
mouth
mildly
biting
and
enjoyable
drinking
one
of
these
is
nice
but
drinking
more
would
be
great
a
great
selection
very
drinkable
a
solid

wish

were
d
a
good
beer
but
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
personal
taste
di
will
definetly
pick
this
up
again
it
was
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
i
have
ever
had

a

this
beer
is
very
good
for
its
style
without
being
overly
fancy
in
the
taste
you
get
mostly
bready
malts
and
caramel
with
a
spicy
bitterness
after
the
swallow

me
of
a
more
miled
dead
guy

only
in
that
finishing
respect
lightmoderate
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
moderate
tasty
although
hops
dont
factor
into
this
much
other
than
to
balance
the

out
a
little
very
easy
drinking
beer
balanced
enough
to
please
the
hopheads
and
the
malt
fans
would
pair
well
with
tons
of
food
it
isnt
heavy
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
a
session
beer
but
isnt
a
mild
beer
either
good
for
all
occasions
a
solid

definitely

foamy
head
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
of
roasted
caramel
malt
with
some
noticeable
hops
taste
is
also
noticeable
by
the
large
presence
of
caramel
malt
as
well
as
some
bitter
hops
i
also
appreciated
the
low
level
of
filtration
as
well
as
the
full
creamy
body
it
offered
by
no
mean
is
this
a
great
beer
but
it
is
surly
one
of
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
had
the
chance
to
drink
di
like
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
good
balanced
flavor
like
many
of
rogues
beers
this
isnt
blowing
me
away
but
neither
will
i
have
any
reservations
about
finishing
the

sound
beer
if
it
were
a

d
this

when

was
very
strongly
hops
with
a
a
hint
of
citrus

and

again
came
thru

on
the
flavor
but
were
balanced
nicely
at

a
great
beer
our
nations
230th
bd
this
poured
a
nice
frothy
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
whole
way
down
pours
a
copper
sunset
hue
it
smelled
of
caramel
fruit
malt
sweetness
roasted
malts
and
a
light
coffee
scent
it
tasted
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
again
caramel
fruit
and
sweetness
were
present
in
tasting
this
beer
the
finish
was
bitter
but
went
down
smooth
and
dry
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
will
definatly
try
again
if
you
have
not
tried
a
rogue
ale
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
start
with
drinkability
hmm
only
5
6
alcohol
i
was
guessing
more
it
seemed
stronger
than
i
wanted
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
liked
the
cocoa
it
caught
me
off
guard
a
bit
what
i
appreciate
about
this
beer
is
that
it
has
a
lot
of
depth
with
the
malts
they
are
not
overly
sweet
but
contain
a
lot
of
boldness
and
character
nutty
fruity
molassas
this
is
balanced
with
big
american
hop
additions
what
i
dont
much
care
for
is
the
schitzophrenic
nature
that
the
hops
play
against
the
malts
there
are
basically
two
beers
in
onean
ipa
and
an
amber
though
neat
its
a
little
muddy
to
me
the
tap
version
seems
to
let
the
carbonation
and
kegsized
volume
to
polish
off
of
the
harsh
hop
edges
add
creaminess
and
blend
the
beer
better
this
takes
away
some
of
the
competition
between
the
hops
and
malts

i
finished
the

pretty
easily
myself
over
two
days
though
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
just
a
bit
thick
and
the
drinkabilty
is
slowed
due
to
cloying
sweetness
tasting
enough
though
i
have
many
beers
that
a
prefer
overall
i
think
this
is
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
heavier
than
others
as
well
i
should
get
this
more
often
this
is
an
entertaining
amber
ale
while
most
ambers
tend
toward
the
malty
and
grainy
side
this
one
is
ipaish
in
terms
of
bitterness
and
strong
hop
aroma
and
flavors
somewhat
of
a
hybrid
of
an
amber
ale
an
esb

and

you
call

little
bit
of
a
sour
fruity
flavor
but
generally
just
reminds
me
of
a
tasty
english
bitter
id
say
its
got
about
a
medium
mouthfeel
a
pretty
decent
balance
of
ingredients
and
flavors
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
ale

good
session

d
the

were

not

and
the

was
pretty
buried
in
the
background
cheers
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
but
in
consideration
to
what
styles
i
like
the
most
this
is
a
decent
effort
this
is
defintly
a
beer
to
try
on
a
colder
day
sip
one
by
a
warm
fire
after
a
run
on
the
skisnowboard

dgood
for
one
or
two

not
all

definetely
a

d
not

nothing

expected
it
to
be
more
balanced

tis
a
session
a
very
pleasant

this
is
one
really
good
amber
im
going
to
pick
up
more

distribute

worth
introducing
them
to

piles

slightly
of

coffee
with
citrus

and
a
sweet

of
hops

sharp
with

then
fades
into
a
coffee
finish
that
is
long
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
leaving
a
lingering
aftertaste
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
topnotch
amber
ale
which
has
a
great
deal
of
character
unlike
many
of
the
more
recent
entries
into

that
ill
certainly
be
revisiting

this
doesnt
rank
among
the
best

but
its
still
solid
this
has
become
one
of
my
regular
beers
on
the
weekends
and
i
plan
to
have
many
more
in
the
future

with

ss
overall
the
smell
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
took
my
first
sip
has
some
of
the
typical
elements
from
a
lot
of
rogue
beers
dont
know
if
its
their
pacman
yeast
or
what
but
really
doesnt
strike
me
as
over
the
top
as
some
of
their
other
beers
sessionable
worth
a
try
i
will
buy

a

again
we
drank
a
wide
range
of
beers
last
night
for
our
mcd
meeting
and
this

was
up
among
the
favorites
for
everyone
involved

i
will
buy
another
of
these
on
my
next
trip
to
the
store
taste
is
a
lot
of
hops
at
first
with
a
little
malty
aftertaste
has
some
nutty
hints
to
it
as
well
goes
down
smooth
on
the
palate
but
drys
it
out
as
well
very
high
drinkability
one
of
my
first
with
the
style
and
it
is
inviting
md
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
following
a
couple
others
which
perhaps
lends
it
an
advantage
in
this
category
but
irregardless
it
seems
to
be
smooth
enough
to
serve
as
a
session
beer
if
needed
i
certainly
know
i
could
follow
this
beer
with
23
more
if
i
wanted
to
quite
drinkable
just
a
bit
boring
for
me
although
i
realize
this
is
not
the
most
exciting
and
challenging
style
decently
tasty
but
there
are
some
things
that
i
cant
quite
describe
that
hold
this
back
from
being
better
might
be
a
better
beer
if
paired
with
some
food
a
classic

a
great
in
between
sipping
type
beer
and
session
beer
hope
the
local
grocery
store
keeps
it
in
stock
and
doesnt
86
it
like
all
the
other
rogues
they
used
to
have
drinkability
this
is
my
favorite
beer
if
i
could
afford
to
drink
it
all
the
time
i
would
the
beer
is
an
amberbrown
color
and
a
little
cloudy
it
pours
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
holds
moderatly
well
and
laces
a
little
it
smells
sweet
and
hoppy
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
but
finished
with
a
distinct
bitterness
from
the
hops
there
is
a
good
thickness
about
this
beer
complimented
by
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
a
meal
or
just
sitting
around
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
pours
nice
dark
ruby
color
into
my
pilsner
glass
with
a
nice
thick
head
smells
malty
and
taste
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
tad
of
caramel
nice
mouthfeel
and
with
good
cabonation
really
good
beer
and
is
expected
from
to
be
from
this
great
brewery
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
a
kielbasa
sausage
it
was
great
for
some
reason
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
head
to
the
fridge
for
another
very
nice
amber
ale
pours
a
dark
reddishcopper
with
some
ruby
highlights
nice
thick
white
head
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
flowery
hops
the
taste
is
a
deep
rich
maltiness
and
again
a
nice
balance
with
some
bitter
hop
flavors
very
drinkable
a
good
amber
ale
from
an
excellent
brewery
dont
know
what
their
talking
about
on
the
bottle
with
the
coffee
aroma
the
carbonation
is
strong
perhaps
a
little
bit
too
strong
small
sharp
bubbles
this
is
a
nice
honest
brew
from
rogue
its
nothing
fancy
but
it
delivers
some
rich
hoppy
flavors
with
a
nicely
balanced
malty
backbone
this
is
an
excellent
and
aggressive
beer
with
a
perfect
mixture
of
quality
ingredients
and
sage
brewing
good
stuff
from
rogue
a
superb
amber
ale
right
up
there
with
red
rocket
ale
in
my
opionion
a
very
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
nice
cloudy
dark
red
amber
some
carbonation
lots
of
lacing
which
i
see
is
very
common
for
rogue
brews
scents
of
hops
malts
and
caramel
very
nice
taste
for
an
amber
hoppy
sweet
caramel
throughout
medium
body
this
is
not
a
strong
amber
but
very
drinkable
many
can
be
had
another
excellent
brew
from
rogues
the
rather
big
hop
aromas
are
not
overdone
in
the
flavor
or
bitterness
of
the
beer
a
well
crafted
wellbalanced
and
eminently
drinkable
brew
rogue
does
it
again
keep
on
rocking
rogue
this
ones
a
winner
dark
amber
in
colour
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
of
roasted
malts
and
both
citrus
and
earthy
hops
full
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
surprisingly
malty
perhaps
munich
malts
upfront
with
a
late
hop
kick
pretty
standard
stuff
fare
from
this
brewery
but
rogues
standards
are
high
good
stuff
you
just
have
to
love
the
labels
on
their
bottles
poured
a
deep
reddishbrown
hazy
color
with
moderate
tannish
head
that
was
easily
rejuvenated
upon
swirling
aroma
is
mainly
a
piney
hop
with
some
maltiness
suggested
the
taste
displays
a
nice
balance
of
toasted
malt
sweetness
and
hops
bitterness
done
in
just
the
right
perportions
to
yield
an
excellent
tasting
beer
finishes
ion
the
same
way
with
the
hops
winning
over
the
malt
in
a
seductive
fashion
an
excellent
beer
will
definitely
try
again
this
was
an
amber
duh
color
heavy
on
the
red
the
beer
was
a
bit
cloudy
for
some
reason
there
was
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
with
hints
of
malt
underneath
and
overall
was
very
clean
it
was
almost
ipalike
the
absence
of
fruitiness
being
a
main
difference
from
that
style
well
the
english
ones
anyway
the
beer
was
fullflavored
with
some
hop
notes
upfront
and
strongly
bitter
the
malt
notes
were
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
good
overall
very
nice
amber
with
a
big
hop
profile
would
go
well
with
bbq
a
great
dark
amber
alebut
the
head
is
a
little
small
the
taste
is
a
clear
crisp
hoppymalty
flavor
you
can
taste
some
mixture
of
spicesbut
its
not
an
overpowering
taste
its
a
very
creamy
alebut
not
the
best
rogue
produces
stillits
better
than
most
ales
taste
is
of
fruity
malt
with
strident
hops
cutting
through
the
malt
nice
bitter
finish
mouth
is
crisp
and
aftertaste
in
the
lingering
low
level
hops
rinse
and
repeat
not
complex
just
tasty
really
drinkable
amber
with
a
decent
hops
profile
you
wont
find
too
many
amber
ales
more
enjoyable
than
this
one
this
could
be
one
monster
of
a
session
beer
another
good
beer
from
rogue
drinkability
a
pleasant
drinking
amber
although
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
in
the
malk
department
this
beer
definately
grows
on
you
not
your
average
amber
ale
for
sure
another
unique
twist
by
rogue
solid
i
bet
this
will
be
very
nice
in
late
fall
season
and
id
definitely
like
to
get
it
on
tap
sometime
nice
looking
deep
red
amber
that
poured
a
nice
head
with
good
head
retention
nose
is
a
distinctive
maltyearthy
tone
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
and
look
out
for
the
unusual
for
the
style
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
the
brewery
nice
and
full
and
chewy
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
i
would
recommend
trying
this
red
possibly
my
favorite
thing
about
rogue
sea
otter
amber
ale
is
that
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
it
support
the
oregon
coast
aquarium
and
its
mission
to
expand
our
understanding
of
the
oceans
quoted
from
the
text
on
the
bottle
extra
points
for
drinkability
here
since
doing
so
will
benefit
something
besides
your
taste
buds
well
a
little
disappointed
in
the
rogue
brew
nice
amber
pour
tan
head
good
laces
enticing
malty
nutty
and
a
touch
of
coffee
aroma
but
the
taste
hmmm
earthy
and
leathery
not
enough
malt

too
hoppy
of
a
finish
somewhat
gritty
in
the
mouth
just
didnt
get
excited
with
this
one
kind
of
a
bummer
this
beer
when
poured
appears
reddish
amber
in
color
and
pours
with
a
nice
tan
head
which
disappears
the
smell
is
sweet
but
not
overpowering
it
smells
like
sweet
roasted
malty
goodness
taste
is
of
light
citrus
and
carmel
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
rich
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
this
is
one
good
beer
and
highly
drinkable
cheers
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
served
chilled
pours
a
nice
rubygarnet
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smells
nutty
with
hops
and
rich
malts
the
taste
has
this
plus
coffee
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
floralcitric
hops
that
have
a
good
bitterness
and
linger
nicely
it
has
a
medium
body
and
is
overall
quite
tasty
great
amber
ale
try
it
if
you
have
a
chance
opinion
aside
from
their
chocolate
stout
i
think
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
from
rogue
it
has
a
lot
of
british
character
while
still
sporting
a
generous
amount
of
us
hop
varieties
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
but
the
entire
presentation
seems
like
it
would
benefit
from
having
an
imperial
counterpart
i
think
that
if
you
just
brought
the
malt
bill
up
by
like
14
to
13
but
leave
the
hops
the
same
that
you
would
have
a
really
nice
american
stock
ale
regardless
this
beer
is
good
on
its
own
merit
pours
copper
orange
outs
of
a
650
ml
bottle
bomber
aroma
is
intoxicating
of
grapefruit
hops
head
develops
to
2
fingers
worth
then
dissipates
after
a
minute
or
two
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
the
hops
flavor
just
rings
off
the
tongue
commprable
to
my
favorite
red
ale
red
seal
very
easily
drinkable
a
nice
and
unchallenging
beer
thats
very
easy
to
enjoy
bitter
but
not
overly
so
sort
of
like
a
pale
ale
cost
3
99
at
liquor
barn
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
oily
but
this
is
an
easy
going
brew
get
the
classic
bottle
with
the
flag
while
you
still
can
or
support
the
oceans
with
the
sea
otter
amber
ale
looks
quite
beautifulvery
deep
nearly
brownish
amber
with
a
voluptuous
caramel
head
smells
strongly
of
hops
and
alcohol
with
lemon
and
orange
zest
there
is
also
a
very
faint
sweetness
after
such
a
powerful
nose
i
was
expecting
to
barely
be
able
to
swallow
this
beer
but
its
considerably
easy
to
drink
complex
hops
and
the
citrus
bitterness
are
delightful
but
personally
i
think
that
either
they
should
be
taken
down
a
notch
or
else
the
sweetness
present
at
the
very
beginning
and
end
should
be
bumped
up
to
ensure
better
balance
preferably
the
former
not
my
favorite
of
the
everjoyable
rogue
creations
but
still
a
great
choice
im
not
sure
how
they
can
improve
on
this
beer
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
give
5s
but
this
beer
is
deserving
rich
flavorfull
perfect
copper
color
nice
frothy
head
with
retention
hoppy
but
not
overkill
great
balance
the
brewer
at
rogue
really
understands
a
pale
ale
its
far
from
a
big
beer
but
its
a
perfect
pale
amber
ale
the
only
thing
i
ranked
it
down
on
were
so
minor
that
its
not
worth
mentioning
i
am
looking
forward
to
more
beers
from
this
brewery
overall
drinkablility
is
exceptional
on
this
one
this
is
one
tasty
ale
that
id
sit
down
to
any
time
another
great
brew
from
rogue
tastes
like
all
of
the
above
remarkable
body
too
as
tasty
as
can
be
but
still
goes
down
like
water
a
real
thirstquenching
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
copperish
brown
color
with
a
flourish
of
a
tan
head
that
vanishes
pretty
quickly
nice
aroma
of
sweet
roasted
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
wellbalanced
palate
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
slightly
bitter
hops
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
pine
sturdy
body
is
superb
for
an
amber
ale
im
not
usually
partial
to
ambers
but
this
is
excellent
fairly
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappears
aroma
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
lightly
citrusy
hops
a
little
sweetness
up
front
followed
immediately
by
quite
a
patch
of
hoppy
bitterness
hop
flavor
is
earthy
and
resinous
and
linger
a
bit
after
the
dryish
finish
moderate
body
and
carbonation
a
solid
and
straightforward
session
brew
this
is
a
fullflavored
entry
to
the
american
ales
for
that
it
deserves
praise
virtually
flawless
i
would
recommend
it
with
any
strongly
flavored
food
such
as
cheeses
bbq
or
beef
perhaps
a
milder
weaker
version
of
arrogant
bastard
taste
is
hoppy
malty
bitter
more
roasted
tones
almost
tastes
stoutlike
tasty
mouthfeel
is
well
rounded
carbonated
bubblyness
matches
well
with
the
smooth
feel
of
it
a
little
chewy
too
very
refreshing
quite
drinkable
as
well
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
each
sip
makes
your
mouth
alive
with
the
bubbles
a
tasty
brew
odd
this
beer
had
the
qualities
and
characteristics
of
an
ipa
moreso
than
an
amber
ale
in
anycase
it
poured
out
to
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
lower
carbonation
odors
of
hops
and
grain
were
noted
as
were
citrus
fruits
flavor
was
rather
bitter
with
notes
of
malt
and
hops
finished
with
a
pine
like
aftertaste
and
slightly
dry
nothing
amazing
here
but
worth
a
try
a
very
nicely
done
brew
sure
i
ranked
it
awfully
high
but
this
is
easily
the
truest
and
best
amber
ive
ever
had
i
highly
doubt
that
any
other
commercial
brewers
are
doing
such
a
solid
amber
damn
a
slightly
hazy
brown
amber
with
3
finger
presistant
head
lacing
on
pint
glass
wonderful
malt
aroma
with
caramel
and
citrusy
floral
hops
sweet
crystal
malt
balances
the
high
ibus
caramel
flavors
give
way
to
lingering
hops
a
session
brew
for
the
hop
lover
thanks
vincent
and
cristy
chefs
pantry
for
making
this
available
locally
it
is
most
unfortunate
to
me
that
i
cannot
just
head
down
to
my
local
bottle
shop
and
grab
this
beer
at
will
its
one
of
those
kinds
that
would
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
at
all
times
sensational
dn
a
very
nice
amber
ale
quite
aggressively
hopped
nice
balance
here
that
definitely
tends
toward
the
hops
quite
drinkable
and
a
solid
recommendation
i
had
this
going
for
a
while
at
a
barbeque
and
i
didnt
think
the
crisp
citrusy
hops
half
of
the
profile
did
so
well
as
it
warmed
up
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
retains
well
this
is
a
cloudy
brew
aroma
is
all
hops
mostly
citrusy
grapefruit
smell
with
a
floral
and
piney
background
and
a
hint
of
molasses
taste
is
big
pacific
nw
hops
grapefruit
pine
oil
floral
and
resiny
hops
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
background
very
flavorful
and
complex
yet
drinkable
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
and
the
carbonation
is
high
making
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
was
afraid
that
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
beer
that
the
hops
would
be
too
strong
or
that
the
fruitiness
would
dominate
too
much
but
the
beer
is
actually
very
nicely
balanced
and
while
i
cant
say
that
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
certainly
one
that
i
can
enjoy
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
i
wish
i
could
shove
this
beer
in
the
face
of
anyone
who
ever
orders
a
killians
quite
a
good
beer
this
one
poured
a
very
ruby
redbrownish
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
foam
that
stayed
around
for
the
whole
glass
full
the
smell
was
light
but
plesant
with
a
light
hop
aroma
and
a
dryness
to
it
that
was
very
appealing
the
flavor
was
session
quality
all
the
way
with
a
near
perfect
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
the
malt
was
not
cloying
at
all
but
it
was
very
toasty
and
the
hops
were
not
overy
bitter
but
they
made
there
presence
known
the
beer
also
has
a
bonedry
aftertaste
that
just
makes
you
grab
another
sip
excelent
stuff
overall
an
above
average
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
a
very
drink
able
brew
the
abv
and
body
and
taste
all
equalled
to
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
does
lend
itself
towards
the
drinkability
but
this
is
rather
boring
compared
to
some
of
the
other
brews
from
rogue
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
and
full
seems
to
be
at
right
about
where
i
like
it
very
quaffable
this
would
make
a
good
session
brew
and
is
a
good
beer
to
introduce
nonbas
to
better
beer
pours
a
redbrown
with
very
small
head
theres
a
bright
aroma
of
grapefruity
cascadey
hops
the
beer
contains
a
large
malt
sweetness
with
lots
of
caramel
accompanied
by
some
light
graininess
and
brown
sugar
the
hops
are
clear
balanced
with
a
gentle
crispness
perhaps
an
element
of
tea
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
nearly
flat
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
amongst
rogues
strong
offerings
its
a
good
sessional
quite
close
to
a
dark
esb
an
appropriate
springweather
beer
when
all
is
damp
but
the
warmth
is
creeping
in
big
head
of
big
bubbles
on
top
of
a
dark
copper
colored
pour
lots
of
lace
left
down
the
walls
of
my
glass
smell
is
nicely
balanced
between
a
big
hop
presence
and
a
sweet
biscuity
maltiness
that
has
a
little
caramel
twinge
to
it
i
didnt
dig
the
flavor
as
much
how
such
a
balanced
smell
could
be
followed
with
such
an
unbalanced
taste
baffles
me
i
could
barely
taste
the
malt
presence
at
all
in
my
opinion
it
was
way
too
hoppy
for
the
style
it
tasted
more
like
an
apa
or
an
ipa
with
a
huge
wave
of
cascade
flavor
im
a
hophead
so
it
didnt
bother
me
as
much
as
it
surprised
me
i
really
feel
like
a
little
less
hop
and
a
little
more
malt
could
make
this
one
hugely
better
the
other
reviews
look
pretty
positive
so
i
might
need
to
try
this
one
again
overall
impression
this
is
a
beer
for
many
other
american
ambers
to
look
up
to
great
example
of
a
popular
style
this
would
be
an
ideal
session
beer
and
its
got
enough
going
on
to
stand
up
to
a
nice
sipping
review
if
only
rogue
would
quit
raising
their
prices
and
include
some
more
information
on
their
labels
drinkability
is
good
another
solid
beer
from
rouge
go
figure
pours
a
brownorange
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
smells
like
a
traditional
rogue
brown
ale
with
the
nuttiness
that
comes
with
it
the
taste
was
terrific
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
a
terrific
synthesis
of
a
fruity
brown
and
a
lager
initial
taste
is
of
a
brown
but
the
after
taste
is
a
deluge
of
amber
that
is
very
pleasant
one
of
the
best
browns
i
have
ever
tasted
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
head
and
very
good
lace
smells
of
a
good
strong
ale
sweet
raisins
toffee
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
some
hop
presence
noted
taste
of
sweet
raisins
caramel
fruity
esters
slight
roastiness
has
a
nice
hop
bite
but
not
too
much
leaves
a
subdued
hop
bitterness
in
your
mouth
a
nice
session
beer
a
fine
example
of
the
style
nicely
balanced
as
far
as
amber
ales
are
concerned
this
is
a
great
one
i
think
i
found
one
of
my
session
beers
for
my
outer
banks
trip
in
early
june
pours
a
murky
brownish
color
and
has
a
huge
tan
head
impressive
it
has
a
nice
malty
aroma
with
subdued
hops
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
superb
there
is
a
nuttiness
that
is
followed
by
a
terrific
hop
bite
i
think
i
am
in
love
it
looks
like
a
brown
ale
smells
like
a
brown
ale
and
it
certainly
tastes
like
a
top
notch
brown
ale
but
it
is
called
a
amber
ale
go
figure
all
i
know
is
that
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
this
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
copper
color
the
head
is
light
tan
it
had
reasonably
good
head
retention
it
leaves
thick
laces
on
the
glass
it
smells
slightly
hoppy
it
smells
spicy
and
floral
also
there
is
a
very
slight
malt
smell
it
tastes
moderately
hoppy
with
a
caramel
flavor
to
it
it
tastes
spicy
also
maybe
a
little
floral
it
is
just
a
little
too
carbonated
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
a
great
session
beer
because
it
s
not
very
strong
in
alcohol
also
the
flavors
are
subtle
and
do
not
overwhelm
your
senses
ultimately
this
is
a
preaty
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
amber
ales
you
will
definately
like
this
one
a
well
balanced
brew
cheers
the
aroma
is
of
cold
coffee
with
a
mild
citrusy
background
the
taste
is
grapefruity
and
obviously
filled
with
hops
there
is
a
distinct
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
while
i
think
this
is
a
top
quality
ale
from
one
of
the
master
brewers
we
have
the
sea
otter
variety
here
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
slightly
brown
amber
color
wtih
a
3
finger
head
that
falls
slowly
to
give
a
very
healthy
coat
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
nice
with
lots
of
sweet
caramel
and
sweet
citrus
hops
it
really
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
fantastic
the
caramel
sweetness
is
dominant
but
the
light
citrus
sweet
hop
plays
very
nicely
in
the
background
the
feel
is
just
a
bit
more
than
moderate
with
a
very
smooth
feel
to
it
rogue
has
done
well
with
this
beer
i
like
it
comments
you
must
try
this
beer
go
out
and
buy
some
right
now
not
bad
at
all
much
much
better
than
the
st
rogue
red
i
thought
this
was
balance
and
had
all
the
right
flavors
i
think
most
rogues
are
better
in
a
bottle
and
this
is
one
of
those
rogues
something
about
the
wonderful
aroma
isnt
as
overwhelming
as
i
think
it
would
be
in
a
bottle
quite
drinkable
id
prefer
a
slight
increase
in
the
malt
flavor
and
a
less
intense
carbonation
but
thats
me
really
nothing
wrong
with
this
overall
this
beer
is
spoton
pours
a
nice
amber
with
gorgeous
2
finger
thick
off
white
more
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
and
toffee
chunkskisses
of
earthy
aroma
the
taste
is
so
smooth
and
wellrounded
the
malt
is
pleasant
and
perfect
for
a
night
by
the
fire
or
in
the
summer
heat
with
a
bbq
this
beer
works
well
in
all
situations
the
hop
is
underscored
but
that
is
good
in
this
case
subtle
but
effectively
done
beer
goes
good
with
bbq
pork
chops
and
rice
a
must
with
this
beer
medium
bodied
and
perfect
or
near
perfect
anyway
overall
very
nice
not
one
of
my
top
shelf
ales
but
definitely
well
above
average
ill
see
this
one
again
from
time
to
time
a
very
dark
red
ale
that
pours
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
a
dirty
glass
perhaps
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
quite
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
coffeelike
character
that
mixes
well
with
a
good
dose
of
spicy
and
bitter
hops
certainly
enough
of
the
resiny
flowers
for
some
hop
burps
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
most
of
the
carbonation
seems
to
have
left
this
beer
as
it
was
poured
could
use
some
more
body
and
some
head
retention
but
this
is
still
a
fairly
robust
ale
and
i
do
like
it
the
roasted
character
is
unique
and
might
put
off
some
amber
ale
drinkers
but
i
like
it
add
some
black
patent
malt
and
youd
have
a
hoppy
dry
stout
i
spent
a
minute
trying
to
figure
it
out
if
the
bottle
guy
was
fixing
his
hat
of
giving
a
salute
rock
on
id
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
st
rogue
red
chinook
centennial
over
american
amber
east
kent
goldings
cascade
because
of
the
hop
varieties
used
theyre
both
excellent
versions
though
and
are
further
evidenceas
if
any
more
was
neededthat
rogue
is
a
worldclass
brewery
thanks
to
wvbeergeek
for
this
kicker
to
a
great
trade
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
brew
definitely
a
keeper
drinkability
what
can
i
say
if
you
like
a
highly
hopped
ipa
by
all
means
order
it
if
you
want
a
smooth
amber
ale
like
the
label
suggests
order
something
else
by
the
time
i
had
drank
23
of
it
i
knew
i
couldnt
finish
the
last
6
oz
ending
up
watering
the
plants
only
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
barleywinestyle
ale
and
the
pale
pilsners
from
the
megabrewers
have
had
this
distinction
up
to
this
point
pours
a
magnificent
amber
duh
head
is
good
for
the
style
but
not
outstanding
smell
is
good
crisp
yet
malty
hearty
and
deep
taste
is
surprisingly
deep
my
first
impression
is
that
malt
is
dominant
and
while
that
is
true
the
hops
come
first
on
the
aftertaste
though
subdued
sweet
and
well
carbonated
an
excellent
conversion
brew
a
very
pleasant
drinking
amber
that
is
well
above
average
imo
this
is
one
that
i
always
return
to
and
is
great
as
a
session
beer
sitting
atop
the
rogue
brewery
quaffing
this
i
couldnt
help
but
feeling
hints
of
the
sea
within
the
glass
american
amber
pours
a
predictable
dark
amber
color
with
a
short
creamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
amazing
deep
roasted
malt
smells
pervade
and
are
wonderfully
rich
and
complex
distinct
nutty
smell
is
prevalent
too
the
taste
of
aaa
is
also
deadon
flavor
has
toffee
notes
mixed
with
some
nuttiness
hops
didnt
seem
as
strong
as
other
reviewers
indicated
and
seemed
mainly
to
help
balance
the
flavor
profile
the
finish
is
sweet
and
lingers
in
my
mouth
i
love
this
beer
and
feel
that
i
could
drink
it
in
large
amounts
wish
this
were
cheaper
and
available
in
sixers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
perhaps
a
little
overcarbonated
but
otherwise
nice
medium
body
another
goodgreat
hoppy
ale
from
the
rogues
in
oregon
this
had
a
really
dark
red
color
with
a
large
foamy
head
the
smell
is
nutty
and
somewhat
spicy
but
those
flavors
dont
come
out
as
much
in
the
taste
this
beer
simply
has
great
balance
there
seemed
to
be
a
hop
bitterness
right
at
the
start
but
there
was
a
good
amount
of
sweet
caramel
taste
and
a
toasted
biscuit
base
to
keep
the
bitterness
in
check
the
finish
has
more
hoppiness
but
its
more
flavorful
and
less
bitter
and
it
lingers
for
quite
some
time
the
flavors
mix
really
well
but
arent
the
smoothest
still
i
drank
the
bomber
in
record
time
and
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
more
very
drinkable
ng
drinkability
suffers
due
to
its
overly
drying
flavors
and
sharp
feel
pretty
drinkable
despite
all
of
its
flaws
overall
an
moderate
or
average
beer
pours
deep
caramel
with
a
nice
fluffy
beige
headlots
of
foamy
lace
and
indistructo
stick
good
malty
aromatics
followed
by
ample
hoppage
giving
a
somewhat
sweet
piney
feel
to
the
beer
rich
and
filling
in
the
mouth
with
above
average
maltage
and
a
just
right
hop
balance
some
fruity
notes
on
the
palate
as
well
a
solid
amber
this
came
in
a
22oz
bomber
with
the
usual
rogue
suspect
on
the
front
with
an
american
flag
behind
him
this
brew
appeared
a
copper
amber
color
with
crystal
clear
clarity
a
tall
rocky
beige
head
formed
atop
this
that
lasted
for
a
while
leaving
sparse
lacing
about
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
caramel
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
sneaking
in
as
this
warmed
a
bit
fairly
simple
smell
but
it
is
a
fitting
and
pleasant
one
fairly
hoppy
in
taste
with
both
earthy
and
citric
hops
playing
over
caramel
malt
back
bone
there
was
a
bit
of
a
roasted
malt
character
as
well
well
balanced
overall
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
this
is
definitely
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
refreshing
beer
that
i
could
down
several
off
in
a
session
one
of
my
favorite
amber
ales
22
ounce
bottle
purchased
in
nashville
at
donelson
pike
a
nice
beer
sweet
and
mild
with
huge
session
appeal
i
find
most
amber
ales
very
easy
drinking
but
i
think
this
one
is
might
be
an
acquired
taste
it
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
thick
head
that
dissipitates
quickly
into
a
thin
film
the
aroma
is
heavy
in
malts
which
is
almost
overpowering
in
the
taste
the
malts
were
kind
of
sweet
and
sour
at
once
also
hints
of
chocolate
and
aged
wood
come
through
the
malts
i
like
this
beer
but
i
fear
i
might
be
turned
off
if
this
is
all
i
drank
for
the
night
piney
hop
forward
aroma
with
rich
maltiness
it
is
the
dryness
acidity
and
bitterness
of
this
beer
i
cannot
get
enough
of
sharp
bitterness
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
nutmeg
easydrinking
i
could
drink
this
all
nite
i
think
low
low
carbonation
nice
brownish
head
with
very
fine
bubbles
on
a
round
and
beautiful
opaque
dark
purple
color
body
the
smell
is
of
red
fruits
sweet
strawberries
mostly
with
yeasty
hints
of
citrus
flavors
or
red
fruits
with
winy
grape
notes
the
chocolatelike
bitterness
progressively
appears
a
bir
ruguous
on
the
tongue
hops
are
quite
herbal
too
the
carbonation
is
low
but
its
a
good
thing
as
it
contributes
to
the
beers
drinkability
and
to
the
expression
fo
the
different
flavors
mouthfeel
is
very
round
and
enjoyable
good
awesome
brew
very
session
worthy
wish
id
tried
it
sooner
this
is
barleywine
embryo
this
is
a
good
flavorful
ale
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
i
smell
hops
and
roasty
malt
taste
is
complex
and
bold
with
rich
malty
slightly
sweet
and
smokey
flavors
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
by
a
good
earthy
hop
bitterness
full
bodied
flavor
with
a
great
hop
finish
recommended
this
is
a
great
rendition
of
the
traditional
american
amber
pouring
a
nice
transparent
mahogany
amber
with
a
frothy
cream
head
on
top
the
smell
is
not
much
however
there
is
a
hint
of
biterness
and
one
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
fullbodied
slightly
bitter
very
very
very
wheatamber
nice
smooth
flow
and
very
drinkable
i
had
the
whole
bomber
and
moved
right
on
to
another
beer
recommended
as
far
as
rogues
go
no
way
to
describe
the
colour
other
than
amber
the
bubbly
head
is
boardering
on
tan
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
a
fine
lace
behind
roasty
aroma
with
a
touch
of
hops
starts
off
with
sweet
malt
carmal
hints
with
hops
moving
quickly
to
the
foreground
this
brew
is
a
little
rough
on
the
palate
but
somehow
it
fits
and
doesnt
at
all
effect
the
drinkability
yet
another
great
brew
from
rogue
a
highly
charismatic
and
appealing
beer
successful
in
its
risktaking
bold
but
never
alienating
while
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
more
than
im
looking
for
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
surely
doesnt
change
my
good
opinion
of
rogue
just
not
my
favorite
style
poured
from
a
bomber
brown
clear
color
small
white
head
that
is
fastfading
smells
faintly
of
hops
taste
is
awesome
lots
of
satisfying
hops
on
warming
a
more
roasted
flavor
comes
out
deliciously
spicy
and
bitter
maybe
a
little
more
malty
than
an
ipa
very
well
balanced
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
fairly
high
bomber
went
down
smoothly
and
quickly
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
creamy
light
beige
head
the
lacing
is
sticky
and
has
the
consistency
of
soap
suds
aroma
of
roasted
malt
fruit
and
hops
mediumbodied
with
an
odd
fruitymetallic
flavoring
that
takes
away
from
the
malt
and
hops
that
would
otherwise
make
this
one
of
the
better
ambers
available
the
finish
contains
malt
hops
and
a
touch
of
coffee
overall
this
beer
is
not
as
bold
as
many
of
the
other
beers
in
their
line
but
it
is
still
worthwhile
to
try
drinkabilitynotes
a
pleasing
beer
although
to
me
it
seems
a
bit
over
hopped
for
an
amber
ale
still
it
is
not
likely
to
disappoint
notes
i
love
how
rogue
puts
the
ingredients
on
their
labels
i
wish
other
breweries
did
the
same
i
like
to
know
exactly
what
i
am
drinking
the
pour
was
deep
copper
with
a
quarter
inch
head
that
quickly
disappeared
and
didnt
stick
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
heavy
in
hops
to
me
with
little
or
no
malt
the
drink
started
with
a
strong
hop
kick
but
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
the
finish
was
clean
and
crisp
with
just
a
slight
taste
of
hops
left
in
your
mouth
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
probably
be
even
better
in
dead
of
summer
its
very
refreshing
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
tang
at
the
end
just
provides
a
kicker
for
the
next
mouthfull
a
good
sit
in
front
of
the
tv
and
watch
a
game
beer
nothing
too
complex
or
even
very
noticeable
a
good
lawnmower
beer
with
soul
and
flavor
wow
an
amber
ale
that
is
precisely
amber
in
color
add
a
rogueesque
creamy
offwhite
head
with
legs
and
you
have
a
very
pretty
beer
aroma
is
very
rogue
as
well
hoppy
up
front
with
a
solid
bready
backbone
but
certainly
imbalanced
toward
the
humulus
camp
the
taste
is
big
for
an
amber
with
prodigious
citric
bitterness
dominating
before
a
smooth
biscuity
finish
that
carries
heavily
minerally
notes
mouthfeel
is
nice
for
the
style
just
a
little
bit
chewy
but
altogether
refreshing
drinkability
is
awesome
esp
with
a
spicy
meal
another
winner
from
rogue
a
bit
more
malt
body
and
balance
would
make
this
a
near
perfect
beer
still
mighty
fine
and
mellower
hop
wise
on
tap
i
paid
4
00
for
a
650
ml
bottle
so
ill
look
for
it
on
tap
first
the
distinct
suggestion
i
got
from
this
beer
is
that
it
could
be
a
small
beer
second
running
of
an
old
crustacean
mash
more
or
less
the
same
flavor
profile
only
lighter
much
lighter
not
bad
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
thank
to
oldcrustacean
ba
member
for
the
bottle
very
tasty
and
mild
brew
you
can
think
of
this
as
rogues
baseline
beer
while
many
other
of
their
brews
are
better
american
amber
ale
is
still
better
than
most
other
beers
out
there
a
good
quaffable
brew
nothign
special
yet
a
good
session
beer
to
keep
on
hand
no
need
to
seek
this
one
out
but
try
it
if
you
come
across
it
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
very
little
aftertaste
as
with
other
ambers
just
some
mellow
caramel
tones
this
is
a
beer
you
can
drink
all
day
a
definite
session
beer
poures
a
thick
khaki
head
that
is
looks
like
ocean
surf
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
sits
above
the
amber
brown
colored
beer
mildly
sweet
malt
aroma
underlayn
by
piney
hops
the
body
is
really
light
bordering
on
watery
the
flavor
is
comprised
of
a
mild
mix
of
coffee
and
fresh
hops
that
finishes
slightly
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
its
a
beautiful
looking
brew
a
nice
dark
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
frothy
brown
head
the
first
thing
to
hit
my
nose
was
the
hops
followed
almost
immediately
by
malt
and
a
coffee
aroma
full
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
bitterness
pacified
by
the
malts
that
felt
good
but
was
just
a
bit
off
in
my
opinion
i
would
have
preferred
a
smoother
finish
still
all
in
all
a
very
nice
amber
ale
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
rogue
has
done
it
yet
again
good
show
i
just
had
one
of
these
at
the
rogue
in
south
beach
newport
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
lingering
head
and
pretty
good
lace
the
aroma
was
mild
with
just
a
touch
of
caramel
tastewise
there
was
a
good
hop
bite
and
a
nice
blend
of
hop
flavor
with
a
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
was
smooth
and
i
was
expecting
a
mellow
finish
so
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
astringent
to
slightly
sour
finish
it
did
go
well
with
the
recommended
ribs
though
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
little
off
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
some
lacing
smelled
hoppy
was
looking
forward
to
the
bitter
bite
bitter
hops
hit
right
away
but
quickly
leave
in
favor
of
a
bready
light
malt
flavor
very
nice
flavor
crisp
mouthfeel
kinda
dry
finish
great
session
brew
could
drink
these
all
night
had
this
on
tap
at
the
cock
n
bull
pub
as
well
i
drink
it
from
the
bottle
an
awful
lot
and
got
all
giddy
when
i
heard
it
was
on
tap
i
tend
to
like
pale
ales
more
but
i
could
survive
on
a
deserted
island
with
this
stuff
no
food
needed
rogue
does
it
well
pours
out
a
cloudy
deep
and
dark
amber
colour
bordering
on
mahogany
a
nice
light
tan
head
appears
and
stays
leaving
thick
rings
of
lace
big
aroma
you
can
smell
from
some
distance
caramel
and
hops
and
some
other
aroma
i
cant
quite
nail
down
it
says
on
the
bottle
it
has
a
coffee
aroma
but
im
not
sure
that
is
totally
accurate
it
smells
delicious
nonetheless
rich
malt
taste
with
the
combo
northwest
and
english
hops
providing
a
tasty
snappiness
and
sharp
bitterness
on
the
tongue
the
medium
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
the
finish
sharp
and
somewhat
dry
the
aftertaste
is
all
rogue
hops
linger
on
and
on
the
yeasty
additions
at
the
end
provide
some
slight
fruitiness
to
the
profile
making
for
a
overall
pleasurable
amber
ale
experience
in
fact
i
consider
this
a
pretty
heavy
duty
amber
riding
the
fence
into
brown
ale
territory
a
solid
brew
from
rogue
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
amber
color
when
poured
followed
by
a
slightly
fruity
aroma
taste
was
malt
based
followed
by
a
flowery
hop
finish
this
was
a
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
my
notes
say
easy
to
drink
glad
i
tried
this
one
had
never
seen
it
on
tap
before
pat
bottom
line
rogue
has
another
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
drinkability

a
terrific
allamerican
amberred

very
similar
to
the
st
rogue
red
overall
impression
a
classic
example
of
an
american
beauty
the
makes
me
want
to
stand
up
and
sing
god
bless
america
it
is
a
nice
touch
that
some
proceeds
go
to
the
911
fund
this
is
a
hophead
beer
with
a
velvet
touch
the
slightest
astringency
just
before
the
aftertaste
kept
this
from
being
all
i
could
want
in
a
beer
and
imho
hurt
drinkability
i
did
get
just
the
slightest
hint
of
coffee
before
hops
beat
it
over
the
head
this
is
a
wellcrafted
ale
like
all
rogue
ales
it
has
a
thick
head
with
excellent
lacing
and
a
deep
and
full
taste
and
aroma
i
am
not
a
strong
fan
of
amber
ales
but
this
is
a
nice
one
as
it
warms
i
find
myself
warming
to
it
as
well
f
pours
a
nice
hazy
dark
copper
brown
the
head
of
frothy
bubbles
is
quite
small
but
has
good
retention
and
forms
a
decent
lace
that
covers
the
surface
lots
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
aroma
which
is
absolutely
great
even
after
it
was
gone
i
had
to
hold
the
bottle
up
to
my
nose
a
couple
times
to
get
a
couple
additional
wiffs
upon
a
smooth
start
malts
are
immediately
noticeable
on
the
pallet
some
caramels
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
fruitiness
is
present
yet
the
malt
sweetness
is
not
overbearing
some
roasted
notes
make
their
way
into
the
mix
around
mid
swallow
and
hops
round
out
a
smooth
finish
quite
nicely
along
with
a
bit
of
additional
roasted
bitterness
this
brew
seems
to
lean
more
towards
the
malts
although
hops
are
somewhat
restrained
they
still
meld
wonderfully
with
the
malts
making
for
one
great
well
balanced
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
this
is
just
a
different
bottling
of
their
american
amber
ale
so
im
only
going
to
review
it
here
also
note
that
this
sea
otter
bottling
is
from
2001
only
so
any
samples
you
find
now
may
be
a
little
outdated
burnt
amber
color
which
at
first
was
hard
to
see
without
some
light
light
tan
head
retains
impressively
well
and
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lace
fresh
aroma
of
spicy
earthy
and
slightly
estery
hops
with
some
grainy
malt
an
excellent
aroma
in
my
opinion
very
spicy
hops
with
a
rindlike
bitterness
in
the
taste
balanced
to
perfection
with
grainlike
malt
a
bit
of
a
fruity
undertone
and
a
bready
finish
a
little
nutty
flavor
in
there
as
well
perhaps
almond
medium
bodied
and
could
be
more
flavorful
but
its
still
a
great
amber
ale
rogue
has
done
it
again
another
topnotch
ale
an
impressive
ale
really
for
some
reason
theres
a
lot
of
lousy
ambers
out
there
and
its
good
to
see
one
thats
this
tasty

the
profits
go

aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
and
has
hints
of
citrus

well
the
flavor
was
fairly
smooth

the
sweet

out

but
it
smells
good
the
taste
is
where
this
thing
comes
into
its
own
malty

tasty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
nice
overall
roasted

against
just
the

this

poured

there
was
not

in
the
way
of

with
this

i
tasted
a
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
this
brew
had
an
aftertaste
that
left
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
it
was
an
okay
brew
but
not
great
i
felt
quite
patriotic
picking
up
the
bottle
i
wish
i
had
seen
it
before
july
4th
but
hey
nice
brown
color
but
the
odor
is
a
little
deceivng
what
you
smell
isn
what
you
get
had
a
mild
hoppy
taste
for
a
west

offering
but
overall
the
hops
were
good
little
malt

a
good
barbeque

pleasant
carbonation
solid
full

very
smooth
on

despite
its

level
more
of
a
cooler

but
great
enough
for
a
session
beer
anytime
of
year
in
my
book
this
brew
poured
a
nice
medium
light
brown
head
that
was
filled
with
small
to
medium
bubbles
it
had
very
little
lacing
it
has
a
very
nice
deep
amber
brown
cloudy
color
with
the
yeast
clearly
floating
around
in
it
it
had
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
its
taste
was
a
little
hard
for
me
to
distinguish
some
carbonation
in
the
mouth
feel
and
there
is
a
hint
of
an
aftertaste
after
a
few
drinks
that
alcohol
in
this
brew
started
to
hit
me
it
is
nice
drinkable
brew
with
a
bit
of

mostly
caramel
notes
becomes
quite
herbal
with
a
pungent
bitterness
in
the
finish
slightly
out
of
balance
for
my
tastes
has
a
medium
body
and
a
rough
and
oily
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
beer
but
would
be
even
better
with
some
more
malt
to
balance
the
bitterness

a
bit
with
some
pretty
strong
wild

field
and
floral

taste
is
a
whacky
balance
of
the
malts
and
hops
the
unevenness
is
a
little
weird
in
the
taste
roasty
caramel
malts
bittered
floral
hops
but
each
sip
brings
out
something
a
little
different
each
time
feel
is
medium
bodied
getting
a
little
thin
but
not
much
unwanted
bitterness
thats
a
bit
much
and
uneven
into
the
finish
not
quite
a
rogue
standard
it
seems
but
is
forgivable
probably
the
most
bland
of
the
rogues
ive
had
thus
far
cloudy
amber
ale
with
nice
foamy
head
and
good
retention
aroma
is
on
the
bland
side
this
is
almost
brutal
bitter
without
the
dryhopping
same
appearance
and
mouthfeel
just
not
as
delicious
drinkability
great
finish
for
this
beer
a
slightly
bitter
taste
on
the
lips
clean
and
very
crisp
finish
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
bomber
was
shot
down
very
quickly
it
looks
like
rogue
has
the
distinction
of
being
my
current
favorite
amber
rogue
scores
another
quality
beer
review
in
my
book
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
although
i
had
it
in
the
warm
summer
months
this
is
most
certainly
even
more
enjoyable
as
a
cooler
weather
session
brew
try
it
out
if
you
can
poured
with
a
cloudy
yellowred
color
and
a
decent
head
but
not
too
much
lace
prickly
carbonation
and
pleasant
hop
taste
thats
not
too
bitter
citrus
well
balanced
with
a
hint
of
floral
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
mild
medium
mouthfeel
brew
in
a
22
oz
bomber
that
left
me
satisfied
caramel
and
hops
but
with
a
very
low
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
next
time
i
see
this
im
getting
it
this
would
go
good
in
the
summer
as
well
as
winter
even
though
its
darker
its
still
a
very
refreshing
beer
but
with
little
heaviness
youd
find
in
a
sout
or
a
bock
amber
is
the
beer
and
amber
is
the
color
a
nice
one
at
that
the
head
is
even
has
a
bit
of
a
red
hint
to
it
the
nose
is
a
bit
roasted
malt
then
hops
i
noticed
a
hint
of
coffee
in
there
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
two
the
taste
is
more
toward
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
and
then
the
nice
balance
of
hops
again
a
nice
blend
of
the
two
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
not
to
over
carbonated
and
it
goes
down
nice
i
still
havent
found
a
rogue
that
i
havent
liked
oh
say
can
you
see
by
the
beer
i
just
poured
okay
i
am
not
going
to
do
a
song
this
is
a
pretty
beer
though
with
a
nice
thick
head
lacing
nicely
along
the
glass
with
each
sip
the
aroma
gives
off
a
sweet
caramel
on
top
of
the
roasted
malt
similar
to
coffee
in
smell
the
sweet
maltiness
takes
on
your
tastebuds
with
the
caramel
flavors
coming
through
noticeably
the
hops
make
their
presence
known
at
the
end
of
each
sip
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
sweet
i
would
like
a
bit
more
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
me
but
overall
another
good
beer
from
rogue
this
is
another
allaround
praiseworthy
ale
from
those
rogues
in
oregon
a
most
drinkable
beer
especially
for
those
that
like
a
bit
of
hops
brownred
in
color
offwhite
creamcolored
thin

dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
few
to
no
signs
it
was
ever
there
aromas
of
caramel
very
sweet
brown
sugar
and
caramel
taste
up
front
a
taste
that
will
linger
if
you
tickle
the
tip
of
your
tongue
with
the
beer
for
a
while
bam
holy
hops
batman
hops
kick
in
as
the
beer
passes
over
the
back
of
the

an
interesting
mix
of
flavor
hop
flavor
lingers
and
lingers
and
lingers
like
a
hangover
tasty
beer
but
the
hop
presence
limits
its
drinkability
for
me
pours
a
darker
amber
shade
no
cloudiness
a
small
head
forms
and
lingers
as
a
lace
all
the
way
down
aroma
consists
mainly
of
hops
and
a
caramel
sweetness
kind
of
like
a
nut
brown
ale
this
beer
is
immediately
crisp
and
refreshing
theres
a
definite
strong
bite
from
the
hops
but
the
maltiness
is
noticeable
too
hops
win
in
the
end
for
a
pleasant
crisp
aftertaste
a
very
solid
offering
by
rogue
i
really
enjoy
the
hops
bite
that
it
has
that
many
amber
ales
dont
have
pours
a
surprisingly
deep
mahogany
body
with
rubycrimson
highlights
capped
by
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
minor
lace
the
nose
displays
grassy
floral
and
lightly
citrusy
hops
cascade
and
ekg
over
some
toffeeish
malt
the
body
is
medium
and
combines
with
a
very
fine
median
carbonation
to
leave
it
mildly
crisp
and
then
somewhat
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
showcases
a
rich
mildly
sweet
and
lightly
toasty
caramel
malt
thats
exquisitely
balanced
by
bold
hop
bitterness
and
vibrant
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
almost
alive
in
your
mouth
it
finishes
dry
with
a
rousing
flash
of
hop
bitterness
and
some
lingering
malt
and
hop
very
nicely
done
its
straightforward
and
not
really
complex
but
fairly
rich
in
flavor
this
beer
should
be
the
touchstone
of
the
style
a
nice
well
balanced
brew
the
smell
is
sweet
caramel
hops
toffee
and
grapes
the
front
is
fresh
toffee
the
hops
are
impatient
showing
up
in
the
middle
with
some
coffee
some
chocolate
and
cream
the
feel
is
foamy
and
full
the
finish
is
super
bitter
and
clean
the
middle
gets
even
creamier
and
the
finish
grainier
as
it
warms
i
love
this
beer
a
little
more
toasty
grains
and
it
would
be
in
contention
for
my
favorite
this
is
one
sexy
beer
it
comes
out
looking
great
thick
red
appearance
with
a
nice
creamy
head
good
use
of
hops
the
hint
of
coffee
really
makes
this
a
nice
drink
wish
i
had
another
one
but
alas
its
gone
the
bottle
is
really
cool
looking
too
hell
a
portion
of
the
procedes
even
goes
to
charity
so
drink
up
i
say
well
done
this
amber
ale
is
anything
but
average
good
stuff
this
is
different
from
most
other
amber
ales
ive
tried
its
richer
and
uses
darker
malts
almost
like
a
nut
brown
ale
that
has
been
highly
hopped
it
pours
a
dark
hazy
mahogany
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
maintains
about
14
inch
and
leaves
rings
of
lace
down
the
glass
marking
how
long
i
take
between
sips
the
aroma
consists
of
strong
caramel
some
pleasant
nuttiness
and
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
between
dark
caramel
toffeeish
malts
and
some
spicy
and
mildly
citric
hops
hops
bitterness
lingers
in
the
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
for
an
amber
overall
another
good
one
from
rogue
but
not
great
another
excellent
brew
from
the
rogue
stable
this
brew
hits
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
utter
royalty
its
rich
amber
color
is
followed
by
a
tannish
red
head
of
pure
frothy
bounty
the
beer
gives
off
a
definite
malt
nose
with
some
faint
hop
aroma
and
a
caramel
sweetness
the
tast
is
great
the
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
are
well
balanced
and
help
to
complete
the
brew
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
an
amber
ale
as
always
that
pacman
yeast
plays
a
big
role
in
the
rogue
mistic
pours
a
clear
brownamber
color
with
a
large
creamcolored
head
the
smell
of
burnt
toasted
malt
and
buttered
baked
biscuits
bellow
out
of
the
longlasting
head
the
taste
mirrors
part
of
the
aroma
with
a
repeat
in
the
burnt
toasted
malt
and
bold
bitter
hops
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
and
finishes
with
a
wet
bitter
end
this
is
a
nicely
done
beer
although
not
my
favorite
offering
from
rogue
i
have
never
been
disappointed
in
anything
they
do
cheers
very
nice
dark

in

probably
my
favorite
of
all
the
rogue
ales
i
have
tried
along
with
the
shakespeare

the
beer
pours
a
deep
cherry
red
with
a
monstrous
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
the
color
a
light
tan

the
decay

and
clinging

of

to
cover

big

hints
of

very
slight
floral
tones
also
noticed
crisp
and
fresh
and
a
pleasure
to
sniff

the

middling
in
feel
with
a
biting
acidity
the
hops
purposeful
in
their
spicy
bite
aftertaste
dry
and
slightly
bitter
who
cares
for
the
beer
is
good
but
am
i
supposed
to
drink
to
support
widows
or
fight
terrorism
or
what
im
confused
poured
a
hazy
amberlight
brown
with
a
short
lived
light
tan
head
the
smell
was
slightly
malty
and
fruity
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
very
quick
hop
bite
and
a
brief
fruity
hint
the
aftertaste
revealed
nothing
different
from
the
smell
and
taste
it
was
a
fine
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
its
a
different
tasting
beer
that
a
will
more
than
likely
be
buying
again
murky
ruby
in
color
with
a
halffinger
very
persistent
creamy
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
and
toffee
malt
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
with
a
aggressive
and
fairly
unusual
hop
aroma
rindy
citrus
and
earthy
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
and
fairly
creamy
on
the
full
side
of
mediumbodied
flavor
starts
off
sweet
with
crystal
malt
again
dominating
with
toffee
and
caramel
notes
midway
through
the
malt
flavor
becomes
just
a
bit
roasty
and
then
the
kent
goldings
and
cascades
kick
in
for
a
very
bitter
finish
this
beer
is
balanced
i
suppose
but
in
a
very
unusual
way
the
malt
completely
dominates
during
the
actual
sip
but
the
aftertaste
is
so
bitter
that
you
almost
have
a
hard
time
believing
you
ever
tasted
anything
sweet
in
the
beer
anyway
whatever
the
balance
its
quite
drinkable
a
very
nice
beer
and
very
easy
to
see
why
its
their
flagship
dark
redoak
in
color
with
a
tan
creamy
dense
head
fades
to
almost
nothing
leaving
a
fine
lace
hop
bitterness
on
the
nose
with
coffee
scents
roasted
malts
too
i
taste
hops
first
off
then
a
hint
of
tannins
give
it
a
iced
tea
character
malts
give
it
a
pretty
good
balance
a
taste
of
currants
is
also
present
this
sample
got
more
complex
towards
the
finish

quite
good

sea

had
more
of

wth
some
fresh

i
like
this
beer
batch
a
little
better
might
be
aged
a
little
more
a
little
more
malt
emerges
in
this
one
but
the
hops
are
great
too
its
fun
to
look
back
at
older
reviews
and
see
how
your
buds
have
matured
or
maybe
the
batches
have
varied
overall
a
good
beer
not
one
of
the
best
in
the
rogue
lineup
but
a
sturdy
and
respectable
amber
ale
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
reddish
brown
color
the
head
was
semi
thick
and
a
pale
white
color
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
with
slight
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
was
hoppy
it
also
had
signs
of
light
malt
and
a
slight
fruit
taste
poured
a
nice
hazy
medium
brown
with
very
little
foam
the
smell
was
of
malts
mixed
with
citrus
and
fruits
the
taste
was
what
you
smelled
but
with
the
hops
mixed
in
with
this
complex
of
flavors
it
also
has
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
to
balance
out
this
beer
i
like
it
very
much
and
will
purchase
it
again
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
love
the
red
white
and
blue
design
on
the
bottle
of
this
one
the
beer
inside
was
pretty
nice
as
well
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
thin
cream
colored
head
nose
is
of
roasted
malts
fruit
and
hops
the
roasted
malts
really
come
through
in
the
taste
with
notes
of
coffee
and
caramel
along
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
at
3
49
for
a
22oz
bottle
ill
definitely
being
buying
more
of
this
fine
brew
maybe
not
a
classic
amber
ale
but
a
great
amber
ale
nonetheless
very
dark
one
of
the
darkest
ambers
ive
had

left
rings

a

quality
was
what
came
to
mind
as
i
was
enjoying
this
with
dinner
im
getting
in
to
rogue
ales
and
this
was
a
nice
offering
from
them
darn
good
amber
i
say
this
beer
would
be

if
there
werent
also
a
rich

stain
to
it
luxurious
pale
head
on
the
nose
pure
hedonism

and
madagascar

i
detect
no
hops
on

but
here
is
a
little
iron
taking
a
drink
feels
like
biting

it
is

if
i
had
more
this
would
be
my
choice

mnf
excellent
amber
ale
this
brew
pours
deep
brown
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
refreshingly
hoppy
with
a
light
fruit
flavor
the
taste
is
initially
hoppy
with
a
nice
malty
taste
that
kicks
in
shortly
after
decent
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
smooth
leaving
a
hoppyfruity
aftertaste
i
will
defeniently
get
this
one
again
hazy

yellowish
14

sense
of
hoppy
grapefruit
in
the

along
with
an
overall
vanilla
sense
smooth
and
mysterious
malt
first
impression
attenuated
by
hop
that
starts
big
and
end
more
floral
sense
of
some
nutmeg
as
well
the
beer
has
a
very
good
balance
but
is
pretty
reserved
for
a
north
american
ale
not
a
lot
of
distinction
as
with
many
beers
nothing
wrong
here
but
i
wonder
if
this
beer
will
appeal
to
many
given
that
rogue
has
such
a
stable
of
finer
and
more
flavorful
brews
this
beer
was
actually
one
of
those
impulse
purchases
much
like
the
tabloids
or
candy
bars
you
see
at
the
grocery
checkout
stand
this
beer
was
sitting
there
yelling
at
me
stating
such
words
as
suck
me
until
im
dry
so
who
am
i
to
deny
such
words
from
a
rogue
beer
in
fact
im
glad
it
did
spoke
to
me
had
i
not
seen
it
trying
to
look
innocent
and
heard
it
speak
such
perverse
vocabulary
at
me
i
never
would
have
given
it
a
second
look
now
that
i
got
it
home
and
popped
its
top
im
about
to
enter
ale
greatness
the
deep
dark
tawny
amber
color
with
its
beautiful
head
was
more
than
inviting
for
my
mouth
to
dive
in
and
taste
the
delicious
contents
beneath
it
as
my
lips
joined
the
tasty
liquid
a
coffee
aroma
enlivened
the
nose
the
full
flavor
was
outstanding
good
overall
ale
in
my
opinion
so
if
you
to
hear
a
perverted
beer
shout
out
at
you
its
probably
rogues
american
amber
ale
so
do
the
patriotic
thing
and
obey
its
commands
and
drink
it
dry
this
amber
ale
poured
a
very
deep
amber
almost
brown
color
from
the
22
oz
bomber
judging
by
appearance
only
this
could
easily
be
classified
as
a
brown
ale
i
was
delighted
to
smell
cascade
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
of
the
cascades
with
a
big
roasted
malt
profile
backing
them
up
its
very
smooth
going
down
with
a
little
of
that
hop
bite
lingering
at
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
one
hoppedup
amber
which
is
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
nice
to
have
this
in
six
packs
another

a
very
wellmade
beer
take
it
for
what
you
will
but
after
a
few
rogue
vagaries
i
thought
i
needed
to
share
this
more
dull
brown
than
amber
in
color
tight
tan
head
that
shrunk
but
some
of
it
stayed
until
the
end
nice

like

flavors
with
a

the

of
the

was

and
moderately
carbonated

and
feel
got
a

thin
toward
the
bottom
of
the

this

the

may
be
tipped
slightly
in

of

hell
this
brews
got
an

not
bad
for
an
amber
its
really
a
nice
tasting
amber
because
even
though
it
is
highly
hopped
you
can
find
the
malt
profile
easily
and
it
is
firm
good
caramel
malt
backbone
provides
a
great
backdrop
for
the

that

very

the
strong
hopping
you
expect
from

not
one
of
their
best
beers

still
good

could
also
be
considered
as
a
brown
ale
due
to
its
deep
colour
and
roasted
flavours
great
cold
season
session
brew
with
a
hot
pot
of
beef
stew
another
winner
from
rogue
a
high
level
american
amber
with
a
touch
more
hop
aroma
drinkable
with
a
fine
meal
or
all
night
long
smooth
and
tremendously
drinkable
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
flavor
the
hops
had
relative
to
the
moderate
degree
of
bittering
the
label
referenced
a
coffee
aroma
but
i
got
none
either
a
very
hoppy
amber
or
a
very
amber
pale
ale
energizer
bunny
head
kept
going
and
going
and
quality
from
start
to
finish
amber
copper
body
with
a
thick
khaki
hued
sea
foam
head
aromas
of
bready
malts
earthy
hops
mineral
water
malt
forward
sourdough
bread
with
notes
of
pine
moderate
bitterness
medium
bodied
resinous
hops
linger
on
the
palate
pretty
good
average
red
ales
just
arent
for
me
a
brown
ale
with
a
strong
hop
profile
surprisingly
creamy
excellent
taste
and
feel
had
some
this
afternoon
and
in
writing
this
i
want
to
revisit
it
as
soon
as
possible
overall
im
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
very
good
beer
for
the
price
and
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
go
to
the
fishermans
fund
which
helps
cover
medical
expenses
of
alaskan
fisherman
not
covered
by
insurance
when
injured
on
one
of
the
most
dangerous
jobs
around
o
depth
of
texture
and
flavours
all
highlighting
the
malts
almost
borderline
double
bock
though
not
as
heavy
or
sweet
its
getting
there
really
well
done
wasnt
expecting
such
a
unique
quality
in
this
beer
roasted
caramel
malts
are
up
front
on
this
one
as
the
hop
bitterness
trickles
in
more
and
more
with
each
sip
eventually
lingering
at
the
finish
solid
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
thick
malty
and
spicy
good
flavor
but
a
bit
too
heavy
for
6
2
abv
o
excellent
it
is
always
interesting
to
review
a
beer
that
most
people
have
only
just
barely
bothered
ranking
then
you
read
the
reviews
and
actually
find
that
if
you
pay
enough
attention
that
beer
might
be
better
than
youve
expected
well
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
not
sure
what
the
average
rogue
drinkers
like
as
they
have
quite
a
few
brews
that
i
personally
would
never
dare
call
beers
but
this
captain
sigs
is
most
certainly
one
a
really
good
beer
actually
it
might
be
more
appealing
to
the
ipa
crowd
like
me
im
a
total
hop
head
at
80
ibus
but
its
got
some
interesting
caramel
malt
flavours
too
its
cloudy
dark
amber
almost
born
in
colour
with
a
good
head
that
vanishes
somewhat
fast
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
slightly
boozy
but
not
harsh
or
anything
just
enough
to
let
you
know
that
you
are
not
dealing
with
a
typical
mass
production
brew
it
has
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
good
nowhere
near
my
alltime
favourite
but
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
buy
again
this
bottle
has
caught
my
eye
on
a
few
occasions
but
i
rarely
purchase
rogue
bombers
largely
believing
that
the
price
point
is
beyond
what
many
of
these
brews
in
fact
deliver
on
the
palate
in
fairness
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
rogue
beer
i
will
say
that
i
am
selective
in
what
i
try
e
g
no
beers
containing
donut
flavoring
this
one
delivers
a
rich
toffee
malt
backbone
with
some
plum
and
dark
toast
notes
massive
crystal
malts
that
hit
that
sweet
spot
darker
and
richer
than
many
amber
ales
bitter
finish
wow
i
am
surprised
that
all
these
seemingly
disparate
elements
hang
together
so
well
without
unpleasant
clashes
insanely
tasty
and
proof
that
when
rogue
gives
up
the
gimmicks
and
other
harebrained
ideas

54overall
this
beer
seems
to
battle
with
the
house
flavors
the
malt
notes
are
good
i
was
expecting
more
rye
and
malts
soild
and
tasty
though
def
not
in
there
pass
over
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
beer
for
you
wv
was
trying
to
convince
me
that
rogue
doesnt
date
their
bottles
because
their
beers
are
brewed
so
well
that
they
are
actually
like
wine
im
like

5444my
second
favourite
of
the
5
rogue
ale
offerings
ive
tried
seems
like
a
good
yearrounder
and
goes
great
with
fatty
malt
drinks
very
well
great
aromas
coming
from
this
one
backed
with
an
evenly
good
well
balanced
taste
like
i
said
happy
i
got
a
few
of
these
because
there
probably
wont
be
any
left
when
i
go
back
to
stock
up
transitioning
into
pine
and
and
grapefruit
bitterness
there
is
a
bit
of
a
malt
backbone
that
provides
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
beer
but
it
was
very
patchy
peach
and
a
touch
of
caramelizedlightly
roasted
malt
this
is
balanced
with
crisp
piney
hops
that
also
display
some
citrus
rind
bitterness
while
finishing
smooth
with
a
slight
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
mediumish
body
and
creamy
coating
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
but
unfortunately
i
dont
have
that
many
to
compare
it
to
the
few
irish
examples
have
the
same
sort
of
sharpness
to
the
grain
bill
that
is
hard
to
place
that
this
beer
has
o
less
than
complex
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
this
beer
has
a
dark
murky
look
to
it
with
a
small
amount
of
head
the
head
has
a
lot
of
bubbles
that
stay
with
the
beer
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
a
light
smell
of
apricots
and
oranges
the
taste
hints
the
senses
with
a
way
different
full
bodied
flavor
of
hops
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
almonds
when
do
drink
this
beer
well
it
cant
be
any
more
obvious
but
while
watching
deadliest
catch
cheers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
two
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
great
retention

great

smells
of

hops
sweet

slight
pine

hint
of
floral
hops
and

of

mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet

citrus
hops
floral
hops
and
slight
roasted
malt
overall
no
complex
but
good
appearance
and
body
d
clean
and
hoppy
brew
not
many
rogue
brews
that
id
order
before
this
one
overall
everything
about
this
beer
screams
rogue
a
testament
to
this
beer
co
plus
portions
of
the
proceeds
of
northwestern
ale
help
to
support
the
fishermans
fund
so
drink
for
a
good
cause
captain
sigs
northwestern
ale
has
a
slightly
couldy
red
colou
and
a
5
mm
head
that
fades
to
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
apple
and
maple
syrup
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
flavour
is
malty
with
notes
of
berries
there
is
some
sharp
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
beer
foamy
and
delicious
this
ale
pours
amber
with
an
orange
hue
and
a
thick
clingy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
an
intruding
mix
of
citrus
spicy
hops
and
sweet
caramel
nutty
malt
the
flavor
is
moderately
hoppy
pine
citrus
and
spicy
with
mediumhigh
hop
bitterness
and
a
subtle
but
still
noticeable
bready
caramel
and
nutty
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
really
quite
smooth
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
hops
lingering
on
the
palate
overall
a
delicious
hoppy
northwest
us
amber
ale
o
this
is
very
onedimensional
beer
its
great
if
youre
a
hop
head
but
otherwise
i
wouldnt
suggest
it
my
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
rocky
tawny
head
with
great
retention
nose
was
pine
hoppy
with
an
underlying
chocolatiness
color
was
a
hazy
deep
reddishamber
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
initial
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
accompanied
by
a
mild
cocoa
flavor
sticky
lacing
began
to
appear
pretty
quickly
finish
was
likewise
initially
heavy
on
the
hops
but
then
giving
way
to
a
mild
cocoa
flavor
on
the
extreme
finish
i
am
mildly
saddened
to
find
that
this
is
a
limited
release
since
my
first
bottle
was
consumed
in
a
darkened
movie
theater
while
i
watched
black
swan
i
decided
to
buy
another
bottle
and
see
how
it
a
looked
in
the
light
and
b
tasted
out
of
a
glass
pretty
darn
good
actually
worth
taking
to
the
movies
if
you
dare
havent
been
able
to
find
this
locally
in
southern
cal
but
mrs
jangles
stumbled
across
an
overpriced
doubleduece
in
a
liquor
store
in
mammoth
today
while
i
was
buying
myself
a
new
down
backpacking
jacket
on
sale
at
mammoth
mountaineering
supply
i
digress
i
packed
it
in
snow
for
the
drive
back
to
bishop
where
i
paired
it
with
a
schats
sandwich
effin
delicious
i
love
rogue
review
over
i
could
down
this
22oz
bottle
but
ill
probably
call
it
quits
for
this
beer
after
that
pours
a
dark
cloudy
burnt
orange
almost
brownish
with
a
tannish
head
then
ring
that
patches
all
over
the
glass
at
first
smell
i
get
delightfully
toasted
malt
sweet
and
aromatic
the
taste
hits
first
as
bitter
almost
tannic
like
its
sat
on
oak
the
feeling
twists
into
some
pretty
powerful
hops
for
an
amber
wet
and
citrusy
then
peppery
all
the
while
feel
is
carbonated
tight
and
pithy
and
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
all
over
again
nice
and
complex
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
flavorful
amber
ale
d
so
drinkable
quaffed
with
too
much
ease
mild
initial
flavor
with
some
bitterness
and
bite
in
the
finish
ultimately
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
good
balance
d
a
delicious
beer
thats
very
drinkable
a
quality
amber
ale
for
this
time
of
year
from
the
folks
at
rogue
and
a
musttry
if
you
can
find
it
wow
this
is
a
slamdunk
for
rogue
excellent
looks
and
feel
and
drinks
as
awesome
as
it
tastes
fantastic
red
ale
maybe
as
good
as
troegs
nugget
nectar
one
of
the
better
rogue
beers
ive
tasted
in
awhile
theyre
usually
a
hit
or
nearmiss
brewery
for
me
this
one
being
a
definite
you
sunk
my
battleship
hit
the
medium
body
is
full
of
life
it
has
a
good
creamy
thickness
while
the
carbonation
keeps
it
plenty
sharp
start
to
finish
the
chalky
feel
lingers
long
after
the
beers
gone
down
the
hatch
awesome
red
ale
bomber
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
orange
amber
with
a
two
finger
foamy
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
fruity
citrusy
grapefruit
rind
hop
character
some
musty
malt
the
taste
is
brash
light
sweet
malty
start
the
hops
move
in
quickly
and
hang
around
for
a
while
texture
a
little
heavier
than
medium
this
beer
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
but
not
quite
as
smooth
a
rugged
ipa
i
liked
it
overall
there
is
a
lot
happening
here
but
much
of
its
a
bit
abrasive
notes
mmmmm
yes
this
is
very
good
and
puts
me
in
the
mood
for
some
crab
fishing
action
cheers
taste
is
solid
a
little
wet
but
not
too
much
hoppy
with
a
citrus
finish
easily
drinkable
beer
d
i
had
the
whole
bomber
so
i
would
say
it
is
very
drinkable
i
would
have
this
beer
again
and
would
suggest
it
for
someone
looking
for
a
amber
with
hop
presence
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
earthy
hops
with
bitter
notes
and
medium
caramel
malt
taste
is
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
earthy
hops
with
some
bitter
notes
and
a
caramel
mat
heavy
presence
body
is
above
average
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
and
refreshing
though
nothing
to
write
home
about
poured
from
a
24
oz
bottle
dark
amber
color
with
nice
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
no
strong
aroma
maybe
a
light
hops
scent
overall
this
is
a
good
amber
ale
a
little
malty
easy
to
drink
not
really
any
distinct
flavors
on
tap
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
d
i
like
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
black
ipa
will
enjoy
again
hopefully
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
maltiness
with
a
gingerbread
note
and
a
small
hop
in
the
taste
sweet
to
dry
maltiness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small

aftertaste
an
ok
ale
but
nothing
to
exciting
no

about
it
this
is
a
heavy
imperial
red
and
i
really
liked
it

another

beer
from

thanks
dad
i
might
not
seek
this
beer
out
for
a
night
on
the
town
or
even
a
causal
night
at
home
but
rest
assured
the
next

is

starts
off
leaning
toward

a
very
sessionable
beer
smooth
yet
creamy

and
good
carbonation
goes
down
nice
and
overall
is
a
tasty
brew

mouthfeel

reminds
me
some
of
brutal

thanks
russ
highly
drinkable
unique
and
overall
a
very
good
beer
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
thought
that
this
might
be
a
gimmick
with
the
deadliest
catch
label
but
it
was
a
solid
beer
i
would
definately
buy
this
beer
again
i
first
bought
it
because
of
the
theme
a
bold
taste
that
has
hints
of

the
taste
starts

with
some
fruit
notes
up

followed
by
a
nice
bitter
bite
followed
by
a
hop
finish
and
aftertaste
there
is
a

but
there
is
still
quite
a
bit
of
that
here
and
even
the
more
aggressive
not
sure
which
ones
off

but
i
am
pretty
confident
in
smelling
willamette
as
you
can
also
taste
the
winelike
contribution
of
wilamette
in
the
body
the
body
has
a
balanced
sweetness
with
hoppiness
that
is
strong
but
in
no
way
overpowering
well
carbonated
and
no

nice
surprise
from
rogue
a
very
nice
india
red
ale
that
feels
not
only
very
well
balanced
but
nicely
rounded
between
hops
and
malt
without
losing
the
character
of
any
story
and
charitable
work
behind
it
are
nice
and
help
to
package
it
but
it
is
a
beer
that
does
not
need
help
to
stand
on
its
own
harshness
wears
off
as
the
beer
warms
though
only
average
drinkability
d
solid
balance
of
big
hop
and
big
malt
flavors
nothing
overpowers
and
a
ample
carbonation
adds
to
drinkability
i
havent
came
across
a
rogue
beer
that
i
didnt
like
i
would
buy
this
one
again
would
go
great
with
grilled
shrimp
and
a
light
salad
d
this
is
another
fine
example
of
what
the
folks
at
rogue
are
capable
of
making
not
my
favorite
release
from
them
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
in
the
future
full
bodied
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweet
citrus
signature
rogue
hop
content
dry
and
bitter
could
use
more
amarillo
the
numbing
bitterness
lingers
for
a
long
while
some
minor
toasty
notes
from
the
malt
overall
ok
pretty
typical
for
rogue
one
and
done
d
this
was
a
tasty
beer
it
could
have
been
smoother
and
much
better
balanced
in
my
opinion
but
overall
it
was
drinkable
and
i
could
have
had
more
d
an
easy
drinker
not
the
best
ive
had
from
rogue
but
it
hit
the
spot
overall
fairly
smooth
and
balanced
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
i
like
balance
in
my
beers
and
there
was
little
support
from
the
malt
character
in
this
beer
that
would
have
lifted
the
flavor
regardless
another
solid
product
from
mr
maier
pours
a
very
nice
deep
red
with
some
nice
head
and
lacing
a
bit
of
a
malty
scent
but
no
overwhelming
redamber
ale
aromas
deep
malt
chocolate
malt
etc
because
of
the
overriding
hop
aroma
too
hoppy
for
its
taste
too
overwhelming
any
nice
amber
ale
flavors
that
should
be
present
had
the
signature
rogue
flavor
which
isnt
bad
but
makes
it
very
nonunique
goes
down
a
bit
rough
from
the
overhopping
if
youre
going
to
make
a
pale
ale
just
make
a
pale
ale
not
a
pale
ale
with
a
bit
of
amber
malt
ingrediants
thin
on
the
body
watery
just
an
overall
average
beer
i
do
like
the
hoppy
bitterness
but
otherwise
i
wouldnt
drop
a
line
of
pots
in
search
for
this
one
nice
drinkable
ale
but
nothing
all
that
special
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
this
good
but
not
best
of
its
type
pours
a
redish
brown
with
a
medium
thick
light
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
clinging
lacing
aroma
is
of
malt
yeast
and
a
touch
of
hops
its
pleasant
enough
but
no
unexpected
notes
hops
hit
the
flavor
right
off
the
bat
more
on
the
piny
side
rather
than
citrus
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
undertone
but
nothing
too
complex
medium
mouth
feel
overall
nicely
drinkable
but
not
extraordinary
drinkability
once
again
a
good
overall
beer
from
rogue
succeeds
in
its
aim
to
combine
amber
ale
and
ipa
drinkability
a
good
amber
ale
and
another
good
beer
from
rogue
as
a
fan
of
deadliest
catch
i
had
to
try
this
beer
i
was
excited
to
find
it
at
my
local
grocery
store
if
you
can
find
it
give
it
a
try
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
medium
in
body
and
medhigh
carbonation
with
a
slight
astringency
at
the
end
overall
a
decent
beer
from
a
good
brewery
but
i
prefer
their
100
meter
ale
listed
under
eugene
city
brewery
medium
body
not
the
smoothest
beer
on
the
market
but
a
damn
fine
beer
could
knock
back
several
go
find
it
youll
be
glad
you
did
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
unimpressive
beers
ive
had
recently
it
has
some
cheap
flavor
from
the
hops
and
little
to
nothing
else
to
round
it
out
oh
well
another
rogue
disappointment
for
me
another
hopped
up
red
ale
from
the
masters
of
hopped
up
red
ales
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
does
eventually
settle
to
a
thick
cap
large
patches
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
big
hoppy
aroma
can
definately
pick
out
the
amarillo
and
cascade
hops
nothing
from
the
malt
is
detected
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
balanced
big
hoppy
citrus
and
resiny
flavor
up
front
and
then
sweetness
from
the
malt
lasts
till
the
finish
bitterness
is
on
the
high
side
i
see
it
is
listed
with
80
ibus
i
believe
it
another
very
good
red
ale
from
rogue
as
a
fan
of
the
show
i
knew
captain
sig
would
not
let
me
down
notes
i
seriously
can
imagine
drinking
this
on
a
ship
out
on
the
bering
sea
as
it
would
serve
as
a
great
warmer
that
would
likely
hold
up
to
lengthy
cellaring
nice
job
i
thought
this
was
an
interesting
concoction
tasty
flavourful
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
on
the
other
hand
not
all
the
flavours
melded
well
for
me
and
one
bomber
of
this
is
enough
to
satisfy
my
curiousity
and
of
course
the
price
doesnt
justify
whats
inside
the
bottle
i
havent
tried
a
rogue
in
a
while
because
im
not
crazy
about
the
house
flavor
but
i
forgot
how
much
i
iike
their
beers
in
general
and
this
brewery
for
its
inventions
this
one
is
a
very
easy
drinker
with
a
nuique
enough
flavor
to
make
it
stand
out
among
over
redamber
ales
i
feel
like
im
doing
something
wrong
when
i
give
the
same
grade
for
all
five
areas
but
this
is
one
of
those
beers
with
nothing
worth
complaining
about
but
nothing
amazing
either
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
hoppy
for
the
style
a
little
akin
to
a
malty
ipa
but
tasty
and
fairly
sessionable
if
the
cloying
nature
of
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
get
to
you
mixing
warning
whiling
drinking
this
beer
i
tasted
some
of
my
wifes
rogue
mocha
porter
and
the
two
flavors
mixing
on
my
tongue
was
extraordinarily
unpleasant
the
two
just
dont
collaborate
curtis
overall
another
great
ale
from
rogue
i
would
definitely
drink
again
a
great
little
limited
release
ale
very
balanced
with
a
good
hop
presence
overall
very
tasty
and
sessionable
at

could
and
did
have
quite

throughout

very

wish
this
was
a
regular
and
not
a
one
off
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
killed
the

in
no
time
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
i
enjoyed

worth
a
try
d
very

goes

this
is

to

for
an

cool

wish
the
beer
was
a
little
more
interesting
though
pours
a
clear
but
slightly
dull
copper
and
reddish
amber
color
nice
head
after
the
pour
that
eventually
recedes
to
nothing
almost
at
the
bottom
of
my
pint
glass
only
one
sluggosh
column
of
bubbling
nice
spicey
hops
aroma
the
malts
and
hops
combine
to
almost
give
a
light
cinnamon
and
pumkin
sweet
aroma
before
tha
hop
citrus
smashes
that
to
bits
the
starts
dry
malty
toast
the
middle
quickly
relinquishes
to
the
hops
the
finish
has
no
sign
of
malt
at
all
only
total
bitting
into
a
whole
orange
taste
and
sensation
what
a
bitter
palate
on
this
brew
once
this
beer
warms
a
little
the
bitterness
is
identical
to
that
of
taking
your
first
bite
into
orange
peel
pretty
bitter
amber
ale
but
still
pretty
cool
novelty
beer
thats
as
bitter
as
the
skeletal
norwegian
on
the
bottle
d
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
beer
i
can
have
with
a
meal
would
go
great
with
beef
dishes
and
such
the
real
benefit
to
the
taste
is
that
it
wont
overpower
food
like
many
ipas
would
on
tap
in
somerville
at
redbones

keg
party
to
kick
of
the
nw
fest
party
dark
red
color
nice
sized

pinelike
smell
super
hoppy
taste
thought
this
was
more
of
a
northwest
ipa
that
anything
else
lingering
hops
on
the
palate
nice
beer
but
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
hops
with
this
one
maybe
not
the
best
choice
for
my
first
beer
on
an
empty
stomach
md
full
body
but
not
thick
hearty
easy
to
drink
pretty
tasty
and
somewhat
complex
not
a
standout
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
remember
back
in
the
day
when
rogue
was
the
coolest
brewer
on
the
block
and
their
beers
tasted
so
original
and
great
they
are
still
a
great
brewer
but
i
get
a
sense
of
sameness
from
their
brews
could
be
the
pacman
yeast
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
tastes
a
lot
like
their
amber
crossed
with
dead
guy
but
darker
i
felt
like
i
had
it
before
lets
nor
get
into
the
renaming
of
the
same
beer
thing
that
rogue
does
i
wish
these
guys
would
take
more
chances
and
shy
away
from
the
house
flavour
maybe
with
some
nice
buttered
crab
id
like
it
more
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
goes
down
nice
and
overall
is
a
tasty
brew
wish
i
had
some
fresh
crab
to
eat
with
it
right
now
overall
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
well
made
drink
wish
the
bomber
was
a
tad
cheaper
good
hoppy
complex
nw
ale
loads
of
bittering
hops
loads
of
malts
it
wont
raise
eyebrows
but
its
a
solid
drinkable
ale
easily
drinkable
and
filling
good
stuff
recommended
drinkability
was
good
nice
balance
with
a
mellow
bitter
finish
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
although
rated
at
80
bdus
is
still
surprisingly
smooth
serving
type
bottle
d
not
the
best
ive
had
but
very
good
none
the
less
a
fitting
substitute
for
anyone
who
may
be
waiting
for
a
particularly
similar
seasonal
release
from
a
certain
central
pa
brewer
not
my
first
choice
on
a
menu
but
id
order
it
overall
theyve
done
a
solid
job
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
dry
slightly
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
and
a
somewhat
slick
feel
on
the
tongue
overall
not
a
bad
beer
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
and
it
does
come
off
as
a
little
bitter
pours
cloudy
grapefruit
colour
with
lots
of
head
taste
is
grapefruit
and
very
hopped
up
and
drying
above
average
mouthfeel
but
also
acidic
drinkable
but
not
super
drinkable
amarillo
and
cascade
i
expected
more
ideas
did
not
all
come
together
faint
chocolate
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
some
floral
hops
and
a
faint
hint
of
pine
balanced
by
a
bready
malt
scent
nice
taste
with
citrusy
grapefruit
up
front
and
a
hint
of
bready
caramel
if
that
makes
sense
i
liked
that
there
was
some
hops
noticeable
in
this
but
i
think
i
may
have
been
expecting
a
little
more
at
80
ibu
all
in
all
this
is
pretty
good
and
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
d
really
good
by
itself
or
paired
with
a
wide
variety
of
common
foods
allinall
a
decent
but
hardly
superlative
beer
im
glad
that
my
purchase
of
it
is
for
a
good
cause
i
bought
this
bottle
at
jungle
jims
in
fairfield
oh
a
few
weeks
back
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
for
its
commplex
flavors
and
aftertaste
the
hops
are
most
noticeable
in
the
finsih
as
they
leave
your

thick

earth
malty

bitter
in
taste
light

but
thick
enough
to
warrant
this
brew
as
a
fall

a
good
thickbodied
brew
that
sits
on
the
palate
as
tough
as
it
fits
on
the
belly
d
eh
pretty
mediocre
beer
but
a
very
good
price
as
said
this
is
more
like
a
pale
than
a
red
so
if
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
pale
this
would
do
finishes
pretty
dirty
sort
of
hazy
with
a
nice
tawny
amber
colour
and
a
thick
inch

cap
of
beige
foam
good

retention
clumpy
lacing
grapefruit
hop
aroma
with
an
edge
of
pine
resin
citrus
mild
malt
bitterness
was
sturdy
and
balanced
up

becoming
more
prominent

the
finish
tangerine

gave
way
to
sweeter
malts
toffee
and
nuts
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
mild
dryness
this
stuff
was
pretty
good
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
little
malt
character
though
i
do
not
get
alot
of
amberlike
feel
to
this
beer
its
good
nonetheless
decently
priced
for
a
rogue
beer
at
5
49
for
a
bomber
id
drink
it
again
d
wow
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
other
than
that
it
is
another
good
job
at
brewing
a
beer
by
rogue
but
elsewhere
north
coast
there
is
the
same
class
of
beer
for
a
better
price
typical
of
the
style
this
beer
seemed
to
aspire
to
a
certain
balance
nice
color
nice
maltiness
with
a
fruity
aroma
and
somewhat
bitter
finish
you
could
certainly
taste
the
hops
but
not
so
much
as
to
overpower
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
had
some
notes
of
honey
and
pears
could
have
taken
a
few
more
chances
but
all
in
all
a
nice
summer
fall
or
perhaps
even
yearroundl
beer
which
is
eminently
drinkable
if
not
great
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
first
appeared
with
a
good
two
finger
head
and
reduced
to
a
eighth
lacing
the
smell
of
hops
slight
malt
and
some
caramel
is
present
the
taste
is
that
of
hops
and
bitterness
not
to
great
of
an
amber
style
beer
d
this
stuff
is
really
really
drinkable
you
will
have
no
complaints
as
far
as
this
goes
d
the
nice
balance
allows
for
more
than
one
to
be
consumed
without
getting
burned
out
even
if
you
dont
like
beers
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
the
good
amount
of
malt
in
this
beer
does
its
part
to
neutralize
them
not
great
but
will
most
likely
have
again
the
taste
is
dominantly
hoppywhich
is
fine
by
mebut
i
would
have
liked
to
see
rogue
get
a
bit
more
creative
with
the
malt
bill
especially
given
the
style
toasted
amber
malt
and
bread
crust
add
a
bit
of
doughy
sweetness
before
a
the
80
ibus
take
hold
lots
of
hop
flavor
to
accompany
the
bitterness
with
grapefruit
and
pine
lasting
long
into
the
finish
great
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
full
body
and
a
spoton
carbonation
level
that
goes
great
with
the
hoppy
ending
overall
captain
sigs
is
yet
another
winner
for
the
already
impressive
rogue
lineup
recommended
d
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
bitter
like
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
very
hearty
very
filling
d
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
but
i
dont
think
it
is
going
to
join
the
primetime
line
up
watching
my
last
episode
of
deadliest
catch
and
enjoying
a
brew
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
orange
hues
cutting
through
at
the
edges
a
large
fluffy
and
craggy
tan
head
wont
let
go
when
it
does
a
this
webb
of
lace
is
left
behind
piny
resiny
hops
float
through
a
mass
of
sweet
malts
to
the
nose
aroma
is
thick
and
earthy
to
an
extent
taste
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
the
hops
are
initially
subverted
by
thick
caramel
malts
and
there
is
not
much
balance
to
speak
of
the
hops
become
more
apparent
after
a
few
drinks
in
but
something
is
still
a
bit
off
some
subtle
light
fruits
exist
way
underneath
it
all
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
a
bit
above
medium
bodied
not
really
feeling
this
one
but
its
not
horrible
either
hops
lean
more
towards
an
english
style
when
all
is
said
and
done
a
hoppy
earthy
red
ale
that
is
okay
but
nothing
groundbreaking
or
noteworthy
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
overly
exctiting
or
above
many
of
the
style
ive
had
especially
of
recent
middle
seems
a
little
lost
in
this
beginning
is
sprite
with
carbonation
to
a
blank
middle
to
citrusy
hop
to
a
chalky
malt
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
im
dissapointed
d
a
good
drinker
d
partook
from
a
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
and
i
enjoyed
just
laying
back
with
it
listening
to
some
ben
harper
and
the
relentess
7
its
one
of
the
hoppier
brews
ive
ever
had
but
it
wont
be
the
last
time
i
drink
it
wonderful
mouthfeel
like
a
down
comforter
for
your
tongue
and
thank
god
it
goes
down
like
milk
d
good
for
the
price
i
have
other
preferences
but
i
wasnt
unhappy
with
this
one
drinks
fairly
easy
despite
the
hops
assault
not
bad
at
all
hop
heads
should
dig
this
drinkability
not
so
sure
its
good
but
a
bit
heavy
and
heavily
hopped
could
see
it
doing
great
things
for
spicy
food
or
a
curry
but
as
a
sipper
im
not
completely
sold
on
it
gotta
love
rogue
but
this
isnt
their
strongest
in
my
opinion
its
good
but
not
great
the
malts
here
remind
me
a
bit
of
dead
guy
but
the
beer
isnt
as
sweet
or
fruity
is
this
because
of
the
large
hopping
rates
for
bitterness
the
beer
takes
on
a
very
english
flavor
and
texture
and
similar
to
some
darker
english
ipas
rogue
is
a
brewery
that
consistently
puts
out
good
beer
if
you
ask
me
yeah
theyre
criticized
quite
a
bit
here
and
there
but
i
like
their
stuff
quite
a
lot
its
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
ill
concede
that
most
of
their
beer
is
straight
forward
and
uncomplicated
captain
sigs
fits
that
description
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
if
youre
looking
to
kick
back
and
spend
the
evening
with
a
simple
yet
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
give
captain
sigs
a
look
or
any
other
rogue
beer
for
that
matter
i
suspect
you
wont
be
disappointed
good
stuff
cheers
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
overall
a
totally
adequate
beer
not
exceptional
but
far
from
bad
i
wish
i
could
say
something
better
but
its
just
a
good
american
red
d
delicious
more
more
more
arrrr
captain
sigs
drinkability
its
another
boldly
bitter
hopforward
offering
from
rogue
if
that
tickles
your
fancy
then
hop
on
the
boat
if
not
well
pours
a
hazy
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
dense
tan
colored
head
that
settles
into
a
solid
cap
some
citrus
and
pine
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
as
bready
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
malt
to
start
some
citrus
and
sprucey
hops
hit
first
with
a
dry
asprin
like
characteristic
this
is
followed
by
a
bready
malt
with
touches
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
tad
to
dry
and
bitter
for
my
liking
solid
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
quite
astringent
with
a
chalky
bitterness
the
hop
profile
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
is
chalky
bitter
and
very
dry
others
will
like
it
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
two
of
my
favorite
past
times
come
together
rogue
beer
and
deadliest
catch
northwestern
ale
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
upfront
with
hints
of
citrus
and
also
toffee
the
taste
has
that
sweetness
up
front
and
a
bitter
towards
the
finish
i
can
taste
chocolate
citrus
and
a
bready
like
quality
overall
this
left
that
hop
taste
in
my
mouth
for
quite
sometime
afte
it
was
finished
an
exciting
beer
for
an
awesome
fisherman
as
i
expect
when
it
comes
to
a
beer
from
rouge
this
is
a
highquality
drink
with
lots
of
harmonic
and
pleasing
flavours
the
beer
pours
a
burnt
amber
hue
which
leaves
a
one
finger
head
that
disspates
to
form
a
layer
of
smoggy
head
across
the
topit
has
aromas
of
fruit
and
caramel
its
a
weird
nice
smellit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
that
tastes
quite
fruity
and
finishes
perfectly
bitter
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
will
buy
again
i
find
myself
returning
for
more
and
it
certainly
is
largely
pretty
good
but
a
earthy
caramelzed
hued
amber
could
have
really
been
awesome
here
sure
the
number
next
to
ibus
on
the
bottle
would
have
been
lower
and
i
love
hops
as
much
or
more
than
the
next
guy
but
hey
you
know
im
just
sayin
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
love
the
hops
in
this
brew
but
it
lacks
character
and
body
d
solid
balance
of
big
hop
and
big
malt
flavors
nothing
overpowers
and
a
ample
carbonation
adds
to
drinkability
this
has
a
great
middle
note
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
fits
the
style
very
well
as
theres
lots
of
malts
that
are
rich
and
sweet
has
a
dense
and
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
and
is
super
easy
to
sip
on
really
well
done
this
is
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
its
not
making
jump
back
on
rogues
high
priced
bandwagon
d
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
brew
but
the
product
is
pretty
unremarkable
a
dcent
red
ale
but
no
threat
to
lagunitas
13
several
elements
here
i
enjoyhops
dryness
woodiness
but
im
not
sure
how
harmonious
they
are
sort
of
jumbled
with
an
odd
note
in
smell
and
flavor
that
i
cant
quite
describe
still
another
good
hoppy
beer
from
these
guys
if
i
am
out
somewhere
i
think
i
may
have
it
again
i
bought
this
as
more
of
a
gimmick
because
of
deadliest
catch
i
will
not
be
buying
again

way
to
go
rogue
the
first
review
made
mine
was
second
must
be
due
to
a
bad
bottle
this
is
a
clean
raw
brew
made
from
fresh
pure
ingredients
and
nothing
else
im
a
big
fan
of
hoppy
red
ales
but
this
offering
from
rogue
left
me
wanting
more
the
look
and
drinkbility
were
good
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
to
stand
out
like
they
could
have
this
was
decent
but
there
are
certainly
some
better
options
available
out
there
during
the
year
for
this
style
d
im
loving
these
india
red
ales
from
rogue
wish
some
australian
breweries
would
do
one
mabey
northwestern
sounds
less
obtrussive
overall
this
is
a
rather
uninteresting
beer
not
much
to
look
at
muted
aroma
and
taste
nothing
offensive
yet
for
the
most
part
theres
nothing
about
this
brew
which
would
make
me
want
it
again
rogue
usually
fails
to
make
my
top
1015
american
craft
breweries
list
hmmm
i
may
have
to
rethink
that
their
beer
especially
the
hoppy
stuff
is
consistently
good
and
is
dangerously
drinkable
captain
sigs
deadliest
ale
is
simply
the
most
recent
example
to
have
entered
and
quickly
exited
my
pint

drinkability
very
smooth
but
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
typically
get
with
this
style
rogue
to
me
is
one
of
my
biggest
hit
or
miss
breweries
when
they
are
on
you
will
find
none
better
this
one
missed
my
palate
and
my
tasting
buddies
agreed
that
it
missed
theirs

this
is
not
a
bad

is
enough

im
glad
i
was

this
is

other
than

this

the
best

i
have
had
i
think
this
yellow
snow
shakespear
and
chocolate
stout
are
the
best
beers
in
rogues
lineup
worth
seeking
out
recommended
d
overall
this
beer
is
very
accurately
named
it
just
screams
the
pnw
i
enjoyed
it
and
wouldnt
mind
having
another

to

brown

whole

tangerine

the
foundational
flavor
of
this
red
ale
is
a
solid
malt
thats
toasty
and
sweet
riding
over
the
top
are
bitter
hop
flavors
like
orange
juice
sticky
pine
sap
and
some
green
apple
these
flavor
levels
get
along
for
the
most
part
and
make
for
an
interesting
brew
but
id
like
to
see
slightly
more
flavor
cohesion
and
interaction
as
it
warms
flavors
begin
to
combine
mouthfeel
is
midweight
and
fine
for
the
style
despite
a
lasting
malty
finish
this
brew
is
quite
bitter
overall
the
interesting
flavor
profile
and
lack
of
funky
flavors
make
this
a
solid
beer
however
its
not
quite
up
to
the
delicious
standard
that
other
rogue

have
achieved
a
a
good
two

i
didnt

i
let
the

warm
a

that
would
release
more
aromas

i
am
able

a
pretty
good
beer
a
surprise
find
never
seen
this
before
must
be
new
this
is
a
good
drinkable
ale
slightly
sweet
and
a
wellbalanced
flavor
this
one
seems
similar
to
the
new
craze
black
ipa
although
this
one
is
more
of
a
brown
ipa
or
red
ipa
or
black
ale
cant
say
red
ale
or
brown
ale
those
are
taken
this
one
has
a
focus
on
the
hops
but
still
has
a
good
presence
of
caramel
its
a
pretty
unique
ale
good
for
a
try
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
very
good
it
smells
like
pine
and
citrusy
hops
along
with
some
caramel
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
mostly
like
citrus
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
pine
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
grain
and
chocolate
noticable
too
theres
also
a
nice
lingering
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
coating
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
know
some
people
would
buy
this
just
because
captain
sig
is
on
the
bottle
but
the
beer
inside
the
bottle
is
good
too
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
drinkability
sessionable
large
red
ale
with
a
great
hops
kick
rogue
make
sold
products
across
the
board
and
this
is
no
different
m
medium
bodied
sticky
sugary
more
akin
to
some
ipas
in
this
regard
really
i
feel
that
red
ipa
is
a
more
appropriate
description
than
amberred
ale
m
d
moderate
carbonation
and
body
quite
smooth
to
finish
leaving
a
lasting
flavour
of
hops
to
linger
in
some
ways
i
would
have
expected
the
alcohol
content
to
be
higher
and
the
taste
of
it
a
little
more
noticed
no
complaints
with
how
it
all
turned
out
though
a
good
offering
from
rogue
that
brewery
i
always
ignore
but
always
enjoy
when
i
end
up
trying
it
not
bad
a
decent
amber
ale
that
has
its
strengths
it
definitely
cant
top
their
other
examples
of
this
style
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
poured
into
2
stout
glasses
wonderful
hops
aroma
not
too
strong
tan
head
that
lingered
a
bit
appearance
was
cloudy
color
was
like
tannin
mouthfeel
was
was
good
not
watery
i
wasnt
expecting
a
pale
ale
but
thats
what
it
tasted
like
to
me
a
little
bitter
but
pleasant
and
smooth
unfortunately
i
knocked
the
bottle
over
and
lost
some
good
head
retention
on
the
floor
though
managed
to
save
some
and
im
glad
i
did
because
i
really
liked
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
its
work
cut
out
for
it
against
so
many
greats
in
its
style
certainly
worth
a
try
not
likely
something
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
though
22oz
bomber
labeled
northwestern
ale
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
murky
almost
muddy
dark
copper
with
a
frothy
twofinger
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
abundant
lacing
aroma
is
pine
and
citrus
hops
blending
nicely
with
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
caramel
malts
and
pine
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
the
beer
also
has
that
definitive
taste
of
pacman
yeast
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
plenty
of
smooth
carbonation
this
one
certainly
goes
beyond
the
standard
rogue
beers
this
one
is
more
akin
to
some
of
their
nonbottled
locker
stock
brews
such
as
latona
and
glen
ale
im
especially
glad
this
ones
in
a
standard
bomber
not
a
15
ceramic
one
note
this
beer
is
now
called
northwestern
ale
likely
owing
to
name
rights
surrounding
deadliest
ale
and
the
deadliest
catch
name
drinkability
overall
a
good
beer
it
has
a
good
blend
of
the
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
the
drink
is
fullish
in
body
with
excellent
creamy
carbonation
and
is
plenty
quaffable
for
sure
probably
great
with
a
fresh
plateful
of
alaskan
king
crab
drinkability
must
be
good
because
i
finished
this
crisp
delicious
22oz
beer
pretty
fast
and
im
not
feeling
it
or
too
full
good
stuff
drinkability
is
good
a
tasty
ale
with
typical
rogue
profile
definitely
better
on
the
warm
side
but
i
could
still
stand
less
bitterness
while
i
dont
generally
support
rogues
bottle
prices
im
happy
to
chip
in
a
portion
to
the
fishermans
fund
poured
into
an

head
lasted
for
a
few
minutes
and
clung
to
the
sides
extremely
well
aroma
was
hoppy
a
touch
of
white
bread
sweetness
taste
was
slightly
bitter
with
some
earthiness
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
tingled
a
bit
on
the
toungue
perhaps
a
bit
over
carbonated
easy
to
sip
but
not
one
to
drink
in
quantity
overall
a
very
tasty
and
vibrant
ale
d
solid
all
around
the
rich
malt
profile
slows
this
one
down
just
a
tad
but
it
is
a
nice
tradeoff
22oz
bottle
purchased
from
anconas
in
ridgefield
ct
pours
the
expected
red
tinged
amber
under
a
nice
fluffycreamy
oatmeal
head
that
leaves
all
kinds
of
nicely
developed
lace
pungent
fruit
infused
hop
nose
allowed
to
warm
up
quite
a
bit
this
one
shows
off
its
style
and
quality
in
waves
of
smooth
malty
layers
and
a
quite
respectable
and
suprising
hop
crunch
pineapple
citrus
and
all
sorts
of
hop
oil
goodness
nice
stuff
and
always
a
treat
to
enjoy
something
and
new
and
of
course
damn
good
from
rogue
i
like
a
lot
of
rouges
beers
and
had
to
try
this
one
because
of
sig
the
ale
lives
up
to
the
name
very
deadly
this
one
was
too
over
the
top
for
me
with
much
bitterness
i
guess
i
could
see
pounding
one
of
these
down
before
heading
out
of
dutch
harbor
for
the
king
crab
fishing
season
a
great
winter
beer
d
hopped
up
enough
to
make
you
an
honest
drinker
of
this
one
think
this
would
fair
really
well
in
a
woodsy
environment
among
a
campfire
on
a
autumn
night
md
medium
body
very
smooth
carbonation
is
felt
slightly
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
overall
a
very
solid
beer
me
and
my
wife
watch
deadliest
catch
weekly
so
honestly
i
grabbed
this
partly
for
that
reasonmade
by
rogue
and
knowing
there
would
be
plentiful
hops
also
helped
poured
into
a
imperial

the

is
nice
for
the
abvwell
made
a
nicely
balanced
brew
it
shows
malt
and
hop
characteristics
well
with
a
rogue
character
an
enjoyable
brew
d
good
drinkability
the
carbonation
gave
this
beer
a
refreshingly
crisp
quality
i
had
the
22oz
bomber
last
night
in
groton
ct
i
dont
know
if
it
is
due
to
the
lack
of
quality
microbrews
in
ct
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
ale
it
had
a
bit
of
citrus
and
hops
and
a
nice
strong
bitter
after
taste
i
could
make
this
my
session
beer
if
i
could
find
it
in
six
packs
this
is
one
of
the
better
rogue
beers
ive
tasted
and
while
it
is
reminiscent
of
some
of
their
other
brews
its
extremely
drinkable
notes
this
is
a
great
brew
nicely
hoppy
in

way
hoppier

i
was

the

reminds

of
other

red

ie
nn

but
without
the

instead
its
more
green
resinous

with
a

crackery
and

the

notes
from
and
tasted
on
32609
this
one
poured
dark
amber
almost
burnt
carmel
with
huge
head
the
smell
was
pretty
malty
the
taste
very
very
malty
as
well
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
i
like
this
alot
very
smooth
i
could
drink
these
one
after
another
this
is
pretty
much
a
standard
red
solid
beer
but
i
am
going
to
stay
away
unless
i
can
find
it
cheaper
than
10
a
pop
4
0
d
complex
enough
for
a
few
more
without
getting
bored
i
like
rogue
but
none
of
their
beers
ever
really
wow
me
the
best
i
have
tried
so
far
ifs
the
12ipa
or
yellow
snow
i
would
recommend
this
brew
mainly
bc
some
proceeds
go
to
the
fishermans
fund
d
pretty
darn
good
red
ale
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
very
cool
bottle
although
i
love
all
the
rogue
bottles
very
unique
overall
delicious
and
well
worth
sekeing
out
i
hope
this
1
lasts
awhile
a
decent
brew
would
work
well
with
a
burger
and
fries
or
maybe
salted
cod
in
sigs
honor
nothing
special
but
worth
a
try
another
average
brew
in
the
style
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
frothy
1
12
tan
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
dark
copper
brew
head
snocones
above
the
rim
with
heavy
coating
lace
aroma
is
piney
hops
and
lightly
fruity
taste
is
lightly
sweet
upfront
then
goes
bitter
for
the
duration
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
character
but
somehow
that
comes
together
well
and
works
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
are
standard
for
the
style
not
quite
as
grabbing
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
a
good
brew
d
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
yet
interesting
enough
to
keep
you
attention
i
bought
it
because
i
like
rogue
and
enjoyed
the
show
but
ended
up
liking
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
im
sure
captain
sig
approves
of
the
results
the
smell
was
of
citrus
especially
grapefruit
it
seemed
to
pack
a
whallop
of
taste
as
it
gave
the
back
of
the
throat
some
burning
sensation
it
had
a
real
nice
bitterness
to
it
and
i
assume
the
ibus
were
up
there
i
would
consider
this
to
be
of
the
red
ipa
style
so
if
those
are
up
your
alley
you
should
love
this
one
taste
was
very
much
like
the
smell
malty
goodness
with
a
great
hop
twanginess
in
my
pint
glass
this
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
a
2
inch
beige
head
and
abundant
lacing
it
had
a
caramel
and
citrus
aroma
the
taste
was
dominated
by
grapefruit
and
i
lost
whatever
malt
i
had
in
the
aroma
the
beer
verged
on
being
too
sharp
and
i
found
myself
taking
a
good
length
of
time
to
drink
it
orangy
brown
beer
with
a
nice
thick
tight
bubbled
creme
coloured
head
aromas
of
grapefruit
hops
caramel
undertones
from
the
malts
unusual
taste
chocolaty
toasty
malts
are
strong
but
a
sea
of
zesty
citric
hoppiness
flows
back
and
forth
over
the
base
good
on
the
palate
well
carbonated
and
a
great
after
taste
overall
a
nice
beer
here
from
rogue
drinkability
i
should
have
grabbed
two
i
am
pleased
with
this
offering
and
would
buy
it
again
without
a
doubt
i
like
the
offbalance
washes
of
flavor
i
feel
that
by
saying
its
off
balance
i
am
putting
it
down
there
has
to
be
a
better
way
to
describe
it
ogres
have
layers
beers
have
layers
i
guess
this
brew
is
much
like
a
veryhoppy
red
im
thinking
cascazilla
with
a
bit
more
maltiness
in
the
balance
very
nice
i
would
guess
the
abv
about
6
or
so
the
bottle
lists
80
ibu
and
i
believe
it
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangereddish
color
with
a
big
2
12
finger
rocky
head
head
retention
on
this
was
fantastic
with
chunky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
very
subtle
hints
of
floral
and
citrusy
hops
with
a
hint
on
spice
taste
is
also
of
some
floral
and
citrus
hops
there
is
definite
hop
bite
at
first
sip
it
then
leads
to
a
bit
of
a
pine
taste
and
muted
malts
this
is
a
medium
body
beer
it
went
down
rather
easily
overall
a
decent
beer
drinkability
tasty
but
bitter
without
the
fullness
of
hops
range
perhaps
intentional
but
it
doesnt
make
me
want
more
love
sig
and
the
show
and
rogue
brewing
but
deadliest
ale
was
only
a
tad
above
average
and
therefore
only
moderately
enjoyable
a
very
good
and
complex
taste
of
bitter
citrus
a
grass
hop
with
a
dark
and
sweet
malt
to
blend
since
its
a
red
ale
i
expect
the
hop
bitterness
to
overpower
the
malt
presence
a
bit
as
it
does
light
alcohol
presence
as
well
as
an
earthy
barley
bite
leaves
the
mouth
a
tad
dry
as
it
should
as
well
nice
bitter
afterbite
i
would
guess
its
about
6
6
alc
very
crisp
and
hoppy
well
worth
the
try
overall
a
verry
nice
beer
bought
the
22
ounce
recently
great
appearance
murky
weak
amber
appearance
with
some
really
excellent
lacing
aromas
had
a
fruity
sour
citrus
flavor
to
it
mixed
with
malts
and
hops
slightly
earthy
but
just
a
hint
bitter
taste
with
great
mixtures
of
hops
yeast
and
grassy
earthy
flavors
good
mouthfeel
stays
carbonated
with
a
good
kick
throughout
drinking
overall
great
drinkability
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
in
my
opinion
another
rogue
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
d
good
beer
ill
pick
up
again
again
nothing
wrong
here
but
also
not
a
great
deal
of
excitement
overall
another
great
brew
from
these
guys
saw
it
last
week
and
didnt
buy
it
but
got
the
last
bottle
this
week
glad
i
did
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
taste
is
smooth
caramel
citrus
spice
light
grapefruit
malt
and
a
touch
of
pine
ends
tangy
on
the
tongue
and
nicely
bitter
a
delightful
full
flavored
hoppy
ale
this
has
to
rank
up
there
with
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
beers
right
behind
american
amber
and
santas
private
reserve
if
it
cost
a
little
less
i
think
i
would
make
this
a
session
beer
d
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
but
its
still
too
strong
for
a
session
beer
to
bitter
for
me
so
sad
pretty
ok
basic
amber
flavor
weird
citrus
flavor
but
my
its
a
good
beer
but
not
great
im
not
sure
why
i
expected
less
or
not
much
at
all
from
these
guys
but
both
beers
ive
had
from
them
have
been
fantastic
this
one
less
so
than
the
bedlam
but
its
great
a
real
hoppy
coppery
red
beer
with
a
ton
of
honey
textured
resins
and
just
the
right
amount
of
both
residual
sugar
and
bitterness
its
definitely
west
coast
in
its
approach
to
the
hopping
and
it
takes
this
red
beer
to
a
place
these
dont
often
go
almost
an
ipa
which
is
awesome
for
me
caramel
malt
has
biscuity
properties
too
layered
maybe
some
oats
in
here
too
as
there
is
plenty
of
body
fuller
body
carbonation
thats
alive
and
a
lingering
hoppy
finish
that
attaches
to
the
sweetness
on
the
tongue
in
a
real
nice
way
i
need
to
find
some
more
beers
from
these
guys
they
have
made
a
huge
impression
on
me
out
of
nowhere
really
stoked
to
have
found
them
great
beers
so
far
pours
a
hazy
caramel
color
with
a
14
head
nice
hoppy
aroma
with
a
sweet
and
citrusy
flavor
this
is
a
good
hoppy
amber
ale
very
drinkable
went
very
well
with
the
spicy
food
i
was
eating
the
body
and
carbonation
are
medium
slight
nutty
aroma
with
little
head
but
a
nice
golden
dark
brown
color
some
nutty
flavor
but
more
hops
come
through
a
easy
drinking
beer
o
overall
a
very
good
amberred
flavor
lives
up
to
what
smell
suggests
about
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
for
flavor
profile
o
totally
decent
but
not
what
i
expected
worth
a
try
would
pick
up
again

45
by
far
my
favorite
beer
from
ale
asylum
since
they
went
to
the
new
brewery
and
bottle
size
the
beer
tends
to
be
a
clearer
in
complexion
which
adds
to
appearance
but
takes
away
from
its
mouthfeel
i
reviewed
the
bottle
but
have
also
had
this
on
draft
at
pubs
and
the
brewery
and
its
remarkably
consistent
overall
really
great
wi
beer
this
is
a
nice
one
nicely
hopped
while
keeping
an
amber
ale
character
well
done
overall
not
a
traditional
amber
by
any
means
very
strong
hop
characteristics
and
a
high
abv
if
you
are
a
fan
of
more
traditional
ambers
this
may
not
be
up
your
alley
but
a
finely
produced
beer
nonetheless
i
am
personally
not
a
fan
of
applying
westcoast
styles
to
ambers
but
i
can
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
good
but
not
great
flavors
are
a
bit
muddies
at
times
lacking
refinement
nonetheless
drinks
fine
and
worth
a
try
cloudy
amber
body
fizzy
offwhite
head
rapidly
diminishing
aroma
of
orange
juice
citrus
raw
grain
caramel
biscuit
sweet
malts
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
it
finishes
lightly
to
moderately
sweet
and
lightly
to
moderately
bitter
medium
body
watery
texture
moderate
carbonation
sweet
citrus
taste
with
notes
of
caramel
and
orange
peel
hop
bitterness
with
some
pine
resin
flavor
kicks
in
just
at
the
right
time
it
lingers
into
the
finish
very
tasty
amber
ale
overall
im
usually
a
little
hesitant
to
go
for
an
amber
but
since
i
heard
this
was
wellhopped
i
picked
up
a
sixer
so
its
more
of
a
amber
ipa
which
is
more
of
my
type
of
beer
ambergeddon
has
a
solid
bitterness
and
enough
malt
underneath
it
to
still
feeel
like
an
amber
just
a
hoppedup
one
o
pretty
tasty
many
good
characteristics
and
i
like
how
its
more
malt
forward
ambergeddon
pours
a
darkish
cloudy
reddish
color
with
a
small
but
lasting
and
lacing
head
there
is
a
nice
bold
hoppy
and
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
bold
good
malt
backbone
with
strong
floral
hop
flavors
drinkable
and
strong
bold
flavors
overall
a
high
quality
red
ale
the
ambergeddon
is
a
good
amber
ale
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
tried
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
with
frothy
head
that
was
leaving
some
lace
the
scent
carried
some
hops
which
really
elevated
its
score
the
taste
had
plenty
of
malt
slightly
sweet
yet
finished
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
offering
overall
after
the
wakeup
call
on
the
first
pull
i
really
enjoyed
the
good
flavors
and
balance
a
very
good
amber
that
i
will
stock
in
my
fridge
overall
i
really
like
it
as
far
as
ambers
go
this
is
on
the
bitter
side
but
definitely
not
either
in
a
bad
way
or
in
an
unbalanced
way
for
instance
a
west
coast
amber
highly
recommended
o
this
is
the
best
local
option
for
an
amber
that
i
can
get
it
deserves
the
outstanding
rating
and
takes
a
malty
amber
to
a
new
level
with
the
generous
dry
hopping
o
better
than
the
average
amber
ambergeddon
brings
a
little
something
extra
to
this
catchall
style
of
beer
assertive
hops
meet
a
beefy
later
of
maltiness
but
neither
backs
down
and
neither
overwhelms
the
other
for
a
balanced
and
flavorful
brew
thanks
to
the
extra
from
someone
in
wisconsin
overall
a
very
good
hopped
up
red
ale
kind
of
reminds
me
of
great
lakes
nosferatu
bold
hops
with
a
big
malty
backing
odefinitely
a
beer
for
the
hophead
this
one
is
too
much
for
someone
looking
for
a
traditional
amber
ale
if
the
hops
were
toned
down
a
bit
this
one
has
potential
just
not
balanced
enough
perfectly
balanced
is
the
best
description
for
this
this
is
stunning
it
is
hoppy
yet
so
masterfully
balanced
this
is
the
bier
that
turned
me
on
to
hoppy
biers
it
has
all
the
hops
you
could
ever
want
skips
the
abrasive
bitterness
and
still
manages
to
do
wisconsin
proud
by
letting
that
malt
pop
in
so
well
did
i
say
very
good
poured
out
as
a
deep
red
color
the
head
was
foamy
and
cream
colored
the
lacing
and
retention
was
pretty
good
on
this
leaving
streaks
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
very
bold
aromas
on
this
one
and
very
inviting
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
malt
backbone
and
a
high
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
brews
that
ale
asylum
makes
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
enjoyable
o
if
this
beer
came
to
my
distribution
area
i
would
pick
it
up
again
a
very
solid
local
treat
overall
pleasant
hopforward
amber
like
a
pumped
up
amber
i
liked
this
a
bit
better
than
a
did
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
the
abv
for
a
red
but
i
cant
complain
about
a
complimentary
buzz
could
use
a
little
more
work
on
the
head
maybe
more
profound
taste
characteristics
m
a
bit
too
watery
for
me
good
coating
but
at
the
expense
of
odd
body
good
aftertaste
flavors
o
a
nice
beer
wish
i
had
this
super
fresh
as
i
imagine
this
one
has
been
around
a
couple
of
months
solid
beer
but
wont
seek
it
out
as
its
not
distributed
in
co
good
drinkable
brew
although
not
without
some
faults
the
aftertaste
is
so
overpowering
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
though
its
a
hoppy
amber
which
is
always
good
in
my
world
o
a
good
refreshing
amber
its
a
quaffing
ale
overall
very
interesting
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
much
sweeter
maltier
and
hoppier
than
a
traditional
amber
i
liked
it
would
drink
again
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
frothy
off
white
bubbly
head
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
ipa
like
herbal
and
spicy
from
the
hops
employed
in
the
taste
a
nice
earthy
bitterness
resinous
and
somewhat
sticky
then
leading
to
drying
grapefruit
rind
caramel
malts
make
up
for
most
of
the
body
and
leave
a
nice
rich
base
for
the
hops
to
shine
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
hoppy
amber
worth
keeping
a
few
on
hand
at
nearly
7
this
is
another
example
of
a
great
american
ale
that
blurs
the
line
of
category
call
it
a
red
ale
an
ipa
or
a
pa
i
call
it
damn
good
and
for
8
99
a
bargain
wisconsin
scores
another
gem
picked
up
from
the
brewery
a
great
mix
of
hops
and
malting
with
a
showcase
fruitiness
good
to
the
last
drop
citrus
peach
smooth
mouthfeel
though
numbing
of
the
palate
followed
tasty
stuff
with
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
red
tinge
very
good
for
the
style
o
pretty
good
west
coast
style
amber
it
was
a
bit
harsh
at
times
but
still
enjoyable
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
it
again
though
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
bitter
earthy
hops
up
front
that
linger
over
the
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
countered
by
a
sweet
citrus
hop
presence
with
hints
of
orange
peel
and
grapefruit
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
rye
caramel
and
biscuit
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
complex
it
reminded
me
of
a
brown
ale
with
an
ipa
kick
my
initial
taste
was
of
malts
that
are
very
similar
to
a
brown
or
amber
ale
but
then
a
hoppy
bitterness
took
over
that
was
similar
to
a
pale
ale
it
lacked
the
citrus
taste
though
that
i
really
like
in
that
type
of
beer
also
a
little
watery
feel
slipped
in
on
the
back
end
of
each
drink
still
though
a
very
solid
local
beer
o
something
falls
short
when
you
sip
this
one
smells
so
good
tastes
so
bland
comparatively
this
beer
is
available
everywhere
in
madison
it
seems
so
its
a
good
one
to
grab
when
lacking
options
id
rather
drink
hopalicous
or
better
yet
bedlam
though
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
the
hype
is
deserved
good
brew
maybe
it
was
starting
with
this
brew
that
made
me
susceptible
to
the
alcohol
taste
but
as
i
drink
it
gets
more
tolerable
with
each
passing
sip
pours
a
hazy
reddish
copper
with
a
tan
head
left
all
over
the
glass
looks
really
fantastic
actually
the
nose
is
light
caramel
and
biscuit
mixed
with
pineyorange
hops
smells
real
nice
this
is
an
amber
with
bite
fairly
substantial
generic
hop
bitterness
maybe
a
touch
of
pine
or
grass
combine
nicely
with
those
light
caramel
and
biscuit
flavors
just
a
touch
of
a
slightly
off
flavor
through
the
middle
of
this
beer
cant
really
place
it
drinks
easy
with
a
bit
of
a
punch
pretty
light
on
the
palette
for
the
abv
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
an
amber
that
is
a
nice
drinker
my
first
beer
from
ale
asylum
and
its
a
good
one
much
better
than
the
mediocre
ambers
most
brewers
put
out
as
their
flagship
beer
overall
high
quality
beer
from
a
local
brewer
thats
largely
overshadowed
by
better
known
highquality
local
brewers
this
is
probably
their
best
known
offering
though
with
a
well
deserved
following
having
recently
tried
ale
asylums
hopalicious
for
the
first
time
and
loved
it
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
offering
my
mouth
wanted
the
citrus
hop
burst
that
the
nose
suggested
but
it
never
happened
and
the
hop
flavor
that
is
presented
has
a
reserved
quality
to
it
that
isnt
helped
by
the
watery
sensation
of
it
overall
it
has
fairly
decent
balance
of
flavors
and
pretty
nice
complexity
i
just
wish
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
dripping
with
hop
flavor
the
taste
of
ambergeddon
is
wellbalanced
by
nutty
almost
husky
malt
grains
a
flash
of
minerals
hits
midsip
before
a
light
tingling
bitterness
graces
the
back
of
the
palate
the
flavors
work
well
together
but
something
seems
a
bit
muted
about
the
whole
experience
mouthfeel
is
soft
on
the
carbonation
and
thinner
than
expected
for
the
style
and
abv
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
amber
but
probably
not
something
ill
be
seeking
out
again
still
id
definitely
buy
it
off
the
shelf
if
given
the
opportunity
o
ale
asylum
impresses
me
more
and
more
as
i
try
a
variety
of
what
they
have
to
offer
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
an
amberred
ale
o
this
is
one
unique
brew
almost
a
brown
ale
disgiused
as
an
amber
im
on
the
fence
with
this
one
but
i
dig
and
reward
originality
and
this
one
is
definately
original
go
get
it
skal
the
cpj
dsharp
bitterness
at
first
made
this
hard
to
drink
quickly
also
the
high
abv
will
limit
the
number
you
can
drink
the
flavor
is
a
bit
grainy
and
slightly
metallic
certainly
too
many
tannins
in
this
one
the
husk
presence
really
comes
through
and
is
not
terribly
enjoyable
detracting
from
the
underlying
amber
malt
and
breadiness
the
finish
is
harsh
and
bitter
unfortunately
something
went
seriously
wrong
in
the
process
of
this
one
d
this
glass
was
extremely
enjoyable
and
i
would
love
to
have
another
if
only
i
was
in
wi
d
another
wisconsin
brewery
that
has
started
to
step
up
its
game
a
little
more
hoppy
than
the
style
suggests
but
that
seems
to
be
a
common
trend
i
am
going
to
have
to
make
it
to
madison
one
of
these
days
to
try
some
of
their
beers
on
tap
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
amber
ale
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
retention
is
awesome
sweet
tones
of
caramel
sugars
and
orange
blend
well
with
the
malts
for
an
amber
i
was
surprised
by
the
amount
of
citrus
in
the
taste
but
is
soon
taken
over
by
the
bitterness
which
slightly
hindered
its
drinkability
drinkability
is
good
only
hurt
by
that
bitterness
that
lingers
if
you
are
a
beer
lover
in
wisconsin
this
is
a
must
try
beer
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
has
a
heavy
scent
of
hops
i
delivers
a
heavy
taste
full
of
flavor
but
finishes
very
smooth
all
bas
this
is
a
must
try
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
going
to
win
any
awards
for
huge
over
the
top
flavor
but
it
is
perfect
for
relaxing
on
a
summer
night
with
some
dinner
and
a
movie
very
sessionable
and
very
drinkable
d
a
solid
effort
from
the
folks
at
ale
asylum
id
be
willing
to
drink
it
more
often
if
that
didnt
require
a
trip
to
wisconsin
pours
a
nice
hazy
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hop
notes
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
slightly
hoppy
and
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
skål
taste
is
very
clean
with
a
hop
and
malt
profile
these
hops
are
different
than
ipa
blend
i
have
not
had
any
beers
of
this
type
so
i
find
the
taste
unique
it
reminds
me
of
some
lagers
the
finish
is
too
astringent
for
me
but
i
think
it
is
true
to
type
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
congrats
to
ale
asylum
for
a
fine
lineup
d
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
either
good
or
bad
and
not
much
else
to
say
a
solid
beer
which
is
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
id
definitely
have
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
super
badass
name
and
label
though
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
its
a
great
tasting
and
easy
drinking
beer
a
very
nice
beer
overall
that
i
really
enjoyed
nicely
drinkable
and
a
well
crafted
hoppy
amber
recommended
m
d
definitely
substantial
body
but
far
from
heavy
another
awesome
brew
from
ale
asylum
d
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
and
keep
some
on
hand
very
nice
brew
recently
had
ontap
at
the
brewpub
and
reviewing
from
a
fresh
bottle
purchased
close
to
the
source
much
more
hop
forward
beer
fresh
nice
citrus
and
pine
hop
qualities
the
appearance
needs
a
little
bump
in
the
score
as
well
a
very
fine
amber
ale
enjoyed
on
tap
at
ale
asylum
in
madison
wi
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
body
with
an
offwhite
head

very
nice

has
a
nice
malty

a

of
sweetness

thanks
for
the

andy
i
may
have
to
get
some
more
from
these
guys
on
our
next
trade
drinkability
is
good
an
excellent
amber
well
balanced
and
mellow
on
the
palate
with
just
enough

to
give
it
character

the

slight
roasted

overall
a
really
good
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
a
great
beer
all
around
i
love
what
ale
asylum
did
with
this
amber
ale
they
really
gave
it
some
character
so
many
flavors
but
quite
complimentary
towards
each
other
i
could
drink
one
or
8
of
these
no
prob
d
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
kick
from
this
beer
based
on
the
description
having
said
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
knocked
it
back
so
quickly
i
was
sad
that
i
didnt
have
another
i
am
really
developing
a
taste
for
reds
that
have
an
american
ipa
aggressiveness
to
them
d
a
great
hoppy
red
wish
i
could
find
some
more
of
this
a
little
strong
to
session
but
a
few
in
a
sitting
would
be
cool
the
best
beer
ive
tasted
from
ale
asylum
which
id
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
hoppy
amber
nice

sort
of
like
an
snpa
very
pleasantly
amped
up
and
dried
out
and
with
a
little
more
complexity
that
might
make
it
sound
pretty
unlike
an
snpa
after
all
but
there
really
is
a
significant
shared
core
of
flavor
but
here
everything
that
dissappoints
me
in
the
sn
offering
is
remedied
here
and
augmented
with
strengths
this
is
really
good
stuff
worth
seeking
out
ale
asylum
ambergeddon
is
a
clear
amber
almost
copper
ale
with
a
thin
splotchy
offwhite
head
with
a
bunch
of
oily
bubbles
on
it
it
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
theres
a
lot
of
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
huge
fresh
hoppy
aroma
its
piny
and
resiny
with
a
hint
of
tangerine
the
malt
smells
biscuity
and
a
hint
sweet
it
smells
like
an
ipa
its
medium
bodied
and
incredibly
smooth
with
a
very
clean
finish
i
taste
a
lot
of
hops
simcoe
the
caramelly
malt
flavor
comes
in
at
the
finish
this
is
very
good
it
really
seems
like
an
ipa
d
too
much
of
a
hop
emphasis
while
it
looks
like
an
amber
ale
it
drinks
more
like
a
pale
ale
with
the
relatively
high
hop
presence
needs
more
malt
balance
pours
a
very
slightly
hazed
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
brown
in
the
middle
some
copper
highlights
on
the
edges
a
nice
white
head
11
5
cm
sits
on
top
which
drops
down
to
a
dense
little
puck
on
top
leaving
pretty
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
toasty
malts
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
some
smells
of
lightly
grassy
hops
and
i
get
some
tart
fruits
like
cherries
oranges
and
underripe
magoes
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
little
citrus
peel
bitterness
and
it
quickly
turns
into
a
dry
toasty
breadiness
like
crackers
then
it
moves
into
a
grassy
almost
resinous
taste
as
it
goes
down
i
kind
of
expected
more
sweetness
but
theres
just
enough
to
carry
the
flavor
without
the
grassy
taste
getting
out
of
hand
i
like
it
the
hops
contribute
to
the
body
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
do
enough
to
help
to
forget
about
the
slight
watery
feel
to
this
the
carbonation
is
good
though
zippy
and
it
actually
warms
me
a
little
and
kind
of
fills
me
up
the
drinkability
is
good
you
wouldnt
think
it
was
a
6
8er
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
at
points
but
it
didnt
quite
blow
me
away
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
came
in
here
this
or
one
of
the
belgians
which
i
only
got
a
taste
of
but
it
seemed
enjoyable
d
quite
easy
to
drink
though
im
not
sure
id
necessarily
trade
for
this
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
red
ale
appears
a
hazed
medium
copper
color
with
a
full
inch
of
lingering
dense
bone
white
foam
a
nice
lace
is
left
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
with
each
sip
aromas
and
flavors
consist
of
citrus
such
as
tangerines
and
grapefruit
juice
mild
pineapple
sweet
caramelized
malt
a
bit
earthy
pleasantly
bitter
and
sweet
throughout
with
a
good
body
and
ample
carbonation
this
almost
gives
nugget
nectar
a
run
for
the
money
this
is
one
hell
of
an
amber
ale
that
becomes
more
and
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
the
most
comparable
beer
to
this
would
be
nugget
nectar
but
i
prefer
this
beer
as
its
got
the
great
hop
profile
but
isnt
as
sweet
d
from
the
smell
i
was
fully
into
this
beer
but
the
taste
threw
me
off
a
little
bit
i
hope
the
oddlooking
sediment
wasnt
affecting
this
but
im
not
wholly
sure
id
be
willing
to
give
this
one
another
try
to
confirm
this
good
beer
though
and
worth
a
try
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
very
drinkable
its
not
extraordinarily
complex
but
its
got
enough
flavor
to
make
it
a
very
good
beer
dnice
sessionable
amber
ale
here
would
be
a
good
dinner
beer
but
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
is
my
second
ale
asylum
beer
and
both
of
them
have
been
good
so
far
im
going
to
check
out
more
from
the
brewery
nicely
drinkable
bigger
then
a
session
beer
but
i
could
sit
and
have
a
couple
very
good
beer
i
recall
it
being
even
better
on
tap
im
looking
forward
to
an
excuse
to
head
east
from
mn
to
try
this
again
out
of
the
fountain
d
a
good
drinkable
brew
smells
fantastic
but
a
little
let
down
with
taste
very
good
red
ale
i
would
buy
it
again
in
large
quantities
d
hoppy
version
of
an
amber
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
overall
a
great
beer
i
remember
my
visit
to
ale
asylum
fondly
and
this
was
probably
my
favorite
on
that
day
it
certainly
hadnt
let
me
down
on
this
second
try
d
this
is
a
great
amber
ale
it
really
has
a
great
hop
character
that
is
rare
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
our
favorite
beers
in
the
summer
along
with
there
hopalicious
i
would
recommend
trying
this
if
your
in
town
very
drinkable
but
at
6
8
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
bold
taste
biting
roast
malt
with
some
sweetness
that
gets
crushed
by
herbal
and
grapefruit
hops
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
should
be
beefed
up
to
coincide
with
robust
flavor
im
bummed
that
the
actual
amber
in
ambergeddon
was
so
overshadowed
by
the
hops
ill
get
you
hopheads
someday
d
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
hopforward
but
instead
i
got
something
pretty
sweet
and
caramely
and
syrupy
while
there
is
a
hop
presence
its
a
bit
muddled
and
buried
by
the
hops
with
that
said
its
not
a
bad
pale
ale
overall
did
drink
this
again
well
done
amber
ale
only
complaint
is
the
somewhat
thinish
body
liked
their
pale
ale
a
little
more
but
this
is
a
quality
brew
too

that
settles
to
a
nice
skim
smells
inviting
with
a
menagerie
of
tropical
fruits
some
sweetness
and
citrus
hops
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
battling
it
out
with
bready
malts
hitting
your
palate
upon
entry
and
then
a
piney
hop
bitterness
taking
over
at
the
back
end
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
a
respectable
semilingering
finish
overall
a
well
made
easy
to
drink
brew
that
i
could
see
myself
reaching
for
on
a
regular

i
otherwise

a

i
see
it
paired

mmm
d
it

i
like
it

good
representation
of

this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
im
very
impressed
with
this
ale
asylum
brew
i
wish
i
had
tried
a
tap
of
it
when
i
was
at
the
brewpub
about
a
month
ago
next
time
ill
know
a
bit
on
the
tannic
side
possibly
just
an
oiliness
from
the
hops
manifesting
themselves
that
way
still
its
medium
bodied
and
would
be
an
easy
choice
for
an
allpurpose
session
beer
well
done
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
based
on
its
previous
ratings
to
me
this
is
an
above
average
amber
ale
but
not
a
great
one
now
i
dont
feel
bad
passing
this
up
the
first
time
i
saw
it
in
madison
hopalicious
is
the
clear
winner
from
ale
asylum
for
me
although
i
havent
tried
their
stout
yet
very
enjoyable
its
the
first
brew
ive
had
from
ale
asylum
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
two
that
are
currently
available
in
bottles
the
nut
brown
and
the
pale
ale
pretty
clear
reddish
amber
colour
with
a
cap
of
thin
beige
foam
some
sticky
lace
and
the
fine
bubbles
stuck
around
once
they
settled
to
a

aroma
some
orange
and
sweetness
with
caramel
slight
alcohol
floral
notes
too
candy
sweetness
up

fruity
tangerine
bitterness
appeared
towards

was

appeared
in
the
finish

with
lingering
earthy

medium

good

a

with

pretty
good

not
overly

didnt
need
to
be
well
made
and
tasty
dgood
really
weel
blanced
the
hops
are
especially
delicious
and
interesting
in
this
brew
a
gem
from
wi
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
id
say
go
for
it
particularly
if
you
love
hops
overall
a
decent
amber
good
mouthfeel
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
heavy
and
pretty
refreshing
poured
with
a
huge
tan
head
very
impressive
and
nice
retention
crystal
clear
except
for
the
sediment
that
i
poured
in
nice
amber
color
no
aroma
that
i
could
detect
taste
was
nicely
balanced
with
hops
and
malt
and
little
more
of
the
hops
on
the
finish
which
i
liked
light
body
with
very
little
carbonation
but
enough
to
keep
it
from
seeming
flat
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
is
very
nice
each
time
i
have
this
beer
i
reach
for
a
second
one
as
soon
as
i
finish
the
first
highly
recommended
this
has
always
been
a
boring
style
for
me
but
this
beer
is
most
definitely
not
boring
if
all
ambers
tasted
this
good
id
be
drinking
them
much
more
frequently
this
beer
is
quite
nice
though
a
bit
hard
to
explain
i
wish
i
coud
have
a
few
of
these
right
now
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
caramel
dark
fruit
and
a
vague
medicinal
smell
in
the
nose
was
this
one
a
bit
off
not
a
bad
nose
overall
but
not
sure
they
were
going
for
the
funky
medicinalspicyband
aid
aromas
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
a
moderate
malt
sweetness
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
soft
mouthfeel
and
light
to
medium
in
body
i
presume
this
is
under
6
abv
making
it
pretty
drinkable
a
very
pleasant
ruby
redamber
color
with
a
relatively
brilliant
finish
but
a
limited
amount
of
carbonation
from
the
look
of
it
aroma
is
what
i
think
an
amber
ale
should
be
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
and
hoppiness
bound
together
so
thoroughly
you
cant
really
tell
where
one
ends
and
the
other
begins
flavor
is
pronounced
hoppiness
not
really
true
to
style
imo
but
delicious
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
like
a
pretty
good
ipa
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
really
like
this
beerpoured
well
with
a
clean
strong
white
head
with
tight
bubbles
the
held
on
for
a
long
time
very
aggressive
hop
nose
citrus
and
grapefruit
and
big
sweet
abundant
malt
as
a
base
to
the
ipa
level
of
hops
this
amber
beer
with
gold
highlights
looks
good
in
the
glass
and
disappeared
quickly
listed
as
american
amber
which
it
doesnt
really
fit
but
not
sure
if
theres
a
style
name
for
it
yetive
seen
imperial
red
or
double
pale
ale
on
similar
beer
flying

double

seems
similar
and
it
becoming

mine

it

no
problem
drinking
a
couple
of
these
after
i
got
to
my
final
destination
but
the
question
remains
is
it
an
amber
to
me
i
would
describe
it
as
american
strong
ale
more
like
an
arrogant
bastard
or
a
eye
of
the
hawk
than
the
typical
amber
ill
buy
more
if
and
when
i
find
it
again
enjoyed
as
warmup
prior
to
a
great
mexican
dinner
with
my
wife
and
a
friend
at
autentica
thanks
tom
for
sending
this
a
while
back
moderate
in
to
and
across
the
mouth
for
a
beer
as
dynamic
as
this
the
structure
seems
a
bit
spare
but
that
may
indeed
be
its
glory
the
slightly
thin
feel
enables
this
to
be
gulped
if
not
ultimately
inhaled
and
drowned
upon
decent
malty
and
hoppy
reddish
amber
ale
maybe
a
touch
too
carbonated
this
is
definitely
the
best
beer
from
the
brewery
ive
had
so
far
served
with
a
decent
head
that
mostly
faded
after
a
bit
dont
notice
the
alcohol
right
off
after
a
couple
o
swallows
theres
a
warming
sensation
definitely
servicable
urp
easy
drinking
nice
hop
head
flavors
but
not
complex
and
profound
as
i
would
have
hoped
based
on
the
name
and
description
d
definitely
beats
your
run
of
the
mill
amber
stands
out
from
the
pack
in
my
opinion
ambergeddon
more
than
lives
up
to
its
name
and
its
label
my
bottle
is
at
least
several
months
old
so
i
cant
imagine
what
this
beer
tastes
like
right
out
of
the
hopper
if
i
could
rub
a
genies
lamp
right
about
now
my
first
wish
would
be
for
this
12
ounce
bottle
to
turn
into
a
bomber
my
second
wish
would
be
for
distribution
to
iowa
my
third
oh
i
dont
know
home
delivery
sounds
good
my
first
beer
from
ale
asylum
and
hopefully
not
my
last
im
a
sucker
for
hoppy
reds
and
this
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
excellent
great
brew
ale
asylum
keep
em
coming
overall
a
very
solid
beer
nothing
i
can
complain
about
ive
now
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
ontap
both
are
equally
delicious
my
favorite
of
their
lineup
pours
an
excellent
orange
and
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
left
great
lacing
and
retained
very
well
smell
is
full
of
pungent
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
the
beer
was
poured
cold
into
a
regular
pint
glass
not
exactly
the
best
for
accenting
aromas
but
it
still
had
plenty
of
aroma
coming
right
to
me
taste
has
a
good
malt
background
even
a
touch
of
biscuit
in
there
while
still
having
the
hops
be
the
leaders
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
have
a
malt
background
and
still
be
pummeled
with
hops
one
of
the
hoppier
beers
ive
had
as
of
late
higher
than
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
levels
just
seemed
to
fit
very
well
with
this
one
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
by
the
pitcher
and
perhaps
ill
just
have
to
do
that
next
time
excellent
beer
here
this
is
worth
seeking
out
the
crossedpistols
and
singlegoldtoothed
skull
on
the
black
and
gold
label
seem
to
imply
a
take
no
prisoners
live
life
on
your
own
terms
attitude
and
the
beer
itself
carries
that
message
through
its
a
hazy
chestnut
with
glowing
orange
highlights
beneath
a
frothy
head
of
ivory
the
head
retention
is
quite
good
and
it
leaves
impressive
lacing
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
followed
by
thin
curtains
of
torn
lace
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
pungent
sharp
tart
grapefruit
leaps
out
at
you
in
the
nose
backed
only
by
a
whispy
curtain
of
pine
and
a
delicate
waft
of
lightly
caramelish
maltiness
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
and
creamysmooth
with
a
veryfine
bubbled
moderate
naturalcarbonation
from
bottleconditioning
the
flavor
offers
more
grapefruit
and
a
touch
of
pine
but
its
at
least
somewhat
reigned
in
by
balancing
malt
its
sweetish
but
just
enough
to
balance
it
and
keep
the
resinousy
hops
afloat
and
its
caramelish
falling
somewhere
between
medium
and
mediumdark
a
bold
bitterness
anchors
it
from
a
maltysweet
side
but
the
hop
flavors
are
let
loose
to
run
free
intense
its
initially
like
squeezing
a
fistfull
of
wet
hops
but
that
gives
way
to
more
maltiness
as
you
get
further
into
it
it
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
strength
to
it
but
the
alcohol
never
really
shows
id
like
it
to
be
more
rounded
but
im
not
sure
how
that
could
be
possible
without
losing
a
bit
of
what
it
already
has
going
for
it
and
i
wonder
how
drinkable
it
could
be
on
a
pint
to
pint
basis
for
the
hop
heads
of
the
world
heres
to
you
extremely
drinkable
unlike
other
apas
ive
had
recently
that
seem
to
follow
this
grapefruit
and
pine
path
this
is
by
far
the
smoothest
mellow
and
delicious
a
new
top
10
for
me
drinkabilityoverall
one
of
those
westcoast
ambers
that
some
may
say
cheat
with
the
aggressive
hopping
but
when
it
tastes
this
good
who
the
hell
cares
this
sits
right
at
the
top
of
the
amber
style
for
me
and
when
bottled
within
the
month
and
more
widelydistributed
will
undoubtedly
become
a
staple
in

that

of

shows
that
even

definitely

checking

location
drinkability
very
good
glad
to
see
this
one
making
moves
on
the
local
scene
as
it
is
a
true
winner
dthis
beer
was
very
drinkable
while
being
a
big
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
nice
complex
malt
and
big
exotic
hops
this
well
worth
the
stop
at
ale
asylum
im
leery
of
lumping
hop
bomb
reds
like
this
and
troegs
nugget
nectar
in
with
the
likes
of
capital
amber
or
leinies
red
it
almost
seems
like
cheating
comparatively
all
regular
reds
and
ambers
should
get
straight
ones
or
twos
when
held
up
to
imperials
like
this
and
so
i
find
my
self
reviewing
three
styles
of
beer
amber
red
and
imp
red
within
one
category
on
ba
despite
my
hesitancy
to
rate
the
imperials
considerably
higher
than
perfectly
drinkable
but
much
less
hopped
reds
and
ambers
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
one
kickbut
beer
appearance
is
a
dark
amberred
with
orange
hues
and
a
thin
creamy
off
white
head
aromas
of
pine
resin
and
grapefruit
are
strong
malts
are
present
but
the
decent
toffeecaramel
backbone
is
largely
overshadowed
by
huge
citrus
hops
this
beer
is
juicy
pulpy
100
grapefruit
its
damn
delicious
very
bitter
but
with
a
creamy
finish
reminiscent
of
dreadnaught
i
will
even
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
this
is
the
best
of
ale
asylums
initial
10
offerings
incredibly
malty
doesnt
hide
the
bite
well
imperial
reds
just
arent
my
thing
overall
this
is
not
the
red
ale
im
accustomed
to
the
hop
and
malt
varieties
dont
work
together
and
are
all
over
the
place
it
also
has
a
gritty
and
very
dry
mouthfeel
overly
carbonated
i
love
a
great
red
such
as
nugget
nectar
and
lagunitas
but
this
is
far
from
those
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
mongo
but
im
very
dissapointed
with
this
offering
it
was
actually
hard
for
me
to
finish
a
really
bythebook
amber
ale
lots
of
westcoast
hoppiness
rich
malts
nice
and
balanced
murky
and
overcarbed
wish
it
were
better
o
maybe
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
if
your
a
hop
head
this
is
a
great
red
ale
for
you
i
just
dont
like
hops
that
much
overall
kind
of
a
disappointment
i
had
the
tidal
wave
ipa
and
the
mongo
ipas
both
had
exceptional
flavor
but
this
even
though
piney
faded
quite
a
bit
with
repeated
sips
very
drinkable
but
not
worth
a
repeated
purchase
had
this
beer
during
trip
to
san
diego
ca
from
tap
place
called
the
hopping
pig
in
gaslamp
area
it
was
decent
but
not
something
i
wanted
to
order
a
second
time
for
an
amber
ale
it
is
very
strong
so
if
you
like
strong
red
ales
id
give
it
a
try
overall
very
nice
imperial
red

b
hoppy
red
with
a
yeasty
base
in
short
the
toasty
malt
takes
a
back
seat
very
spritzy
mild
bitter
aftertaste
im
personally
not
digging
the
boozy
sugary
aspects
but
hey
thats
me
has
the
imperial
appeal
that
does
have
its
fan
base
kinda
reminds
me
of
palate
wrecker
in
some
way
nice
abv
that
toasts
this
overall
experience
decent
brew
nonetheless
a
translucent
copper
colored
beer
with
a
red
head
like
my
girlfriend
the
aroma
is
sweethop
tied
to
some
grassy
flaves
the
overall
palette
is
somewhat
malty
but
still
with
strong
notes
of
hops
the
alcohol
is
a
plus
subtle
bitterness
derived
from
the
english
challenger
hops
with
desired
qualities
from
the
crystal
malt
give
it
a
must
buy
more
note
on
the
white
board
but
folks
basically
its
a
belgian
golden
ale
brewed
with
lots
of
hops
and
heard
that
it
was
created
for
the
brewers
wedding
celebration
i
live
on
the
coast
near
great
white
sharks
and
this
beer
has
nothing
to
do
with
all
that
except
the
hint
of
blood
just
a
great
beer
o
the
toastedburnt
component
comes
across
most
but
everything
is
balanced
quite
a
tasty
brew
d
a
nice
revisit
as
this
one
had
really
exceeded
my
recollections
this
bottle
was
either
uber
fresh
or
shark
attack
is
just
way
better
than
i
had
remembered
it
to
be
would
recommend
for
a
nice
hoppy
amber
drinkability
for
every
red
beer
fan
like
myself
im
sure
theres
someone
who
loves
this
but
for
me
shark
attack
is
just
so
so
perfumeey
hops
dont
anything
for
me
overall
big
smokey
red
ipa
somewhat
sweet
and
smoky
and
fairly
drinkable
another
good
offering
by
port
mouthfeel
body
was
medium
as
it
should
be
i
got
a
little
dissapointed
on
the
carbonation
though
too
much
and
lively
for
my
preferences
filling
the
mouth
with
extra
foam
sometimes
which
narrowed
down
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
sometimes
it
did
help
though
spreading
out
the
aromas
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
choice
for
any
time
of
the
year
i
would
recommend
it
taste
starts
with
caramel
then
orange
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
then
roasty
toffee
has
a
caramelorange
aftertaste
has
a
heavy
mouthfeel
and
slightly
above
average
carbonation
for
a
double
ale
o
this
isnt
by
any
means
my
favorite
beer
but
its
not
the
worst
its
not
even
that
bad
really
that
said
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
taste
like
this
and
i
think
its
a
bit
unbalanced
on
the
whole
o
great
drinkability
port

quality
california
über
alles
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
robust
start
of
the
flavoring
we
began
with
a
nice
toasty
buttery
blend
of
pale
and
caramel
malts
with
eventual
depth
grown
from
the
plastic
and
boozy
inclusions
these
helped
to
flesh
out
the
meat
of
this
brew
and
to
hold
up
against
the
bite
of
citric
and
earthy
hops
with
its
own
sweetness
both
the
nose
and
the
mouthfeel
remain
soft
throughout
the
tasting
contributing
equally
to
the
final
picture
this
beer
is
actually
quite
representative
for
the
style
and
well
executed
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
great
beer
for
its
style
definitely
a
sipper
at
9
abv
having
this
at
2pm
may
not
have
been
the
best
idea
poured
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
nice
one
finger
off
white
head
scents
of
caramel
malt
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
strong
with
a
high
hop
bitterness
mostly
piney
but
with
some
citrus
notes
balanced
by
a
malt
sweetness
theres
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
very
high
in
hop
character
with
malt
keeping
it
manageable
but
still
very
much
a
hophead
kind
of
beer
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
with
a
thick
sticky
feel
very
good
and
akin
to
an
american
strong
ale
or
a
lower
abv
barleywine
an
excellent
ale
it
reminds
me
of
double
bastard
but
with
more
hop
character
and
less
of
the
sticky
sweetness
o
more
ipa
than
red
ale
although
there
is
a
markedly
red
tone
to
its
color
irish
red
ale
crossed
with
a
west
coast
ipa
too
much
bitter
grapefruit
for
my
taste
overall
drinkable
but
a
far
cry
from
a
top
choice
we
hold
out
for
brews
that
are
at
least
a
7
on
our
scale
cheers
this
was
a
great
surprise
beer
for
me
i
was
drinking
some
lost
abbey
and
thought
id
give
this
a
shot
since
its
from
the
same
area
and
it
was
great
the
beer
has
some
nice
strength
to
it
and
doesnt
leave
you
hanging
nothing
overdone
as
well
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
revolutionary
either
wife
stuck
this
in
my
stocking
for
christmas
looked
great
when
poured
had
a
nice
medium
red
color
the
smell
was
average
it
was
all
downhill
from
there
and
then
down
the
drain
this
is
not
the
the
most
hoppy
beer
ive
had
but
mighty
close
the
mouth
feel
was
fine
but
the
bitter
aftertaste
stuck
with
me
after
my
next
beer
if
your
a
hop
lover
go
for
it
otherwise
go
to
something
more
malty
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
double
red
i
would
def
buy
again
and
even
order
if
i
ever
see
it
on
a
menu
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
somewhat
gritty

this
is
pretty
good

the

its

feel
doesnt
hide
its
abv
but
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
all
in

this
one
is
pretty
good
o
a
beer
for
the
select
that
truly
appreciate
hops
and
the
strength
and
intensity
of
flavors
rather
than
subtlety
and
complexity
if
the
idea
of
being
attacked
by
a
shark
could
be
bottled
then
this
is
that
brew
o
a
bit
overly
aggressive
if
i
must
make
a
complaint
it
is
interesting
being
heavy
on
the
hops
and
almost
bleeding
alcohol
i
find
it
interesting
for
sure
but
im
not
sure
that
i
would

was

not

to

that
in

did

when
you
are

i

the

on

is
great

is
well

glad
the

is
not
as
intensely
bitter
as
might
be
expected
from
the
hop
aromas
very
drinkable
totally
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
have
soft
spot
for
imperial
reds
but
this
one
breaks
away
from
the
pack
this
level
of
sugarycaramel
sweetness
would
be
rude
in
another
beer
but
the
brewer
has
assaulted
it
with
american
hops
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
most
agreeable
i
would
have
had
more
but
would
probably
end
up
on
the
floor
as
a
victim
of
this
shark
attack
d
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
some
good
richness
from
the
toasted
lightly
syrupy
flavors
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copperamber
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
pineherbal
hops
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
there
is
a
medium
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
red
ale
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
i
think
this
would
greatly
benefit
from
a
year
or
two
of
age
it
is
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
the
hops
are
more
bitter
than
full
of
flavor
it
goes
straight
from
boozy
to
bitter
with
just
a
quick
glimpse
of
the
malty
goodness
in
the
middle
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
with
thanks
to
beermasons
i
get
to
and
it
pours
a
very
dark
non

orange
hue
with
a

i
find
that
the

really
balance
this
drop
out
in
a
good
way
to
just
take
that
slight
bitterness
away
and
for
me
a
really
enjoyable
american
amber
that
i
could
drink
all
night
i
just
wish
i
had
more
of
it
cheers
o
i
had
this
beer
all
wrong
it
is
a
boozy
bitter
and
very
malty
beast
of
a
beer
this
is
not
your
hopped
up
amber
ipa
crossbreed
honestly
i
feel
that
it
represents
its
namesake
quite
well
both
being
a
shark
attack
and
a
double
red
ale
although
i
prefer
the
hoppierless
malty
amber
ales
i
cant
hate
on
this
one
for
being
different
amazing
none
the
less
overall
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
hearty
malt
focused
beer
this
one
will
do
it
for
you
slow
sipping
but
also
satisfying
bottle
hit
the
shelves
just
a
matter
of
hours
before
i
purchased
according
tot
he
stocker
at
parker
payless
i
wanted
to
sample
this
while
on
vacation
in
san
diego
but
it
didnt
come
to
be
at
my
visit
to
portpizza
port
anyhow
poured
from
undated
though
i
am
assuming
quite
fresh
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
ruby
mahogany
with
a
huge
3
finger
creamyoffwhite
head
amazing
retention
and
gobs
of
lacing
looks
impeccable
the
nose
is
quite
hop
heavy
with
a
healthy
dose
of
citrus
aroma
hints
of
pine
and
earthy
hop
character
though
mostly
the
citrus
youd
expect
from
the
west
coast
a
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
as
well
i
really
enjoy
the
aroma
the
flavor
continues
on
the
nose
with
an
initial
surge
of
hop
flavor
as
described
in
the
nose
the
beer
takes
a
while
to
materialize
on
the
tongue
as
all
the
flavors
come
to
fruition
the
citrus
hop
and
medium
bitterness
are
consistent
through
out
after
the
initial
surge
of
hops
the
caramel
sweetness
enters
and
provides
a
nice
compliment
to
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
i
found
the
beer
to
be
hop
forward
but
relatively
well
balanced
for
the
high
abv
smooth
and
full
bodied
good
carbonation
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
just
super
fresh
but
i
cant
understand
all
the
sub4
ratings
its
received
i
think
its
a
terrific
brew
and
would
happily
purchase
again
highly
recommended
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
is
very
easy
to
put
down
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
blast
of
dry
sticky
hops
that
linger
over
the
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
bone
dry
finish
very
earthy
and
bitter
with
lots
of
dank
pine
needle
flavor
hop
profile
is
one
dimensional
and
is
countered
by
way
too
strong
of
a
malt
backbone
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
notes
as
well
as
some
zesty
peppery
spice
some
alcohol
heat
in
the
finish
but
abv
relatively
well
masked
the
hop
profile
is
one
dimensional
and
theres
too
much
malt
for
my
preference
overall
this
was
is
good
albeit
flawed
on
a
few
fronts
and
just
didnt
quite
click
for
me
while
its
not
my
favorite
offering
from
port
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
22

very

the
alcohol

i
think
id
like
this
beer
more
if
had
more
citrus
and
less
bitter
hops
this
was
a
good
beer
but
the
balance
was
just
a
little
off
pleasant
beer
if
that
booziness
subsided
i
could
drink
this
all
night
coda
interesting
that
i
drank
this
being
told
it
was
around
5
now
realising
it
is
9
removes
some
of
the
surprise
big
factor
in
the
notes
above
no
overbearing
alcohol
present
quite
clearly
in
the
brew
not
convinced
this
works
that
well
has
a
bold
and
interesting
malt
bill
but
a
conspicuous
lack
of
hop
aromas
and
flavours
seems
only
bittering
hops
come
through
to
temper
the
richness
and
sweeteness
personal
note
the
booze
is
strong
with
this
beer
greatness
and
uniqueness
of
flavor
do
not
seem
to
warrant
such
high
alcohol
percentages
trying
the
port
brewing
shark
attack
double
red
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
amberred
with
decent
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
there
is
some
fresh
hop
balanced
by
malt
the
taste
is
powered
by
a
big
malt
with
hop
balance
the
beer
starts
very
malty
then
the
hop
come
in
to
balance
the
beer
and
clean
the
pallet
i
am
thinking
semcoe
hop
since
it
is
a
bit
more
fuller
in
body
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
very
good
especially
for
those
looking
for
a
higher
powered
red
ale
medium
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
with
an
oily
hop
resin
feel
not
extremely
familiar
with
this
style
but
again
seems
very
close
to
a
dipa
first
time
ive
tried
a
beer
from
this
brewery
it
pours
a
very
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
the
smell
is
quite
nice
with
a
bite
at
first
then
sort
of
mellows
out
the
taste
is
the
same
it
hits
you
with
a
ton
of
hops
at
first
sip
but
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
the
thick
head
leaves
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
of
hops
and
malt
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
overall
tasty
well
done
imperial
red
overall
i
guess
i
really
dont
know
this
style
very
well
i
think
that
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
a
double
red
this
is
a
substantial
beer
and
one
that
although
i
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
id
definitely
visit
it
again
next
time
im
in
san
diego
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
larger
version
of
surly
furious
very
drinkable
hoppy
red
ill
definitely
have
it
again
given
the
chance
but
nothing
about
it
really
wows
me
the
finish
is
very
lightly
hoppy
for
a
double
red
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
very
tasty
red
overall
brash
and
heady
but
it
has
some
needed
balancing
components
present
to
give
aid
in
finishing
off
what
is
a
big
hoppy
beer
brimming
with
alcohol
shark
attack
pours
into
the
glass
a
very
bold
orange
color
with
some
light
shades
of
bronze
within
a
nice
inch
of
white
stuff
on
top
with
good
retention
leaving
spraypaint
lacing
it
does
not
go
anywhere
smell
is
on
the
malty
side
of
things
with
sweet
caramel
and
apple
a
nice
heaping
of
bright
hops
leaving
a
bold
earthy
scent
some
trace
amounts
of
sugar
sweet
and
earthy
hops
with
some
vanilla
meld
together
with
warming
damn
this
is
good
beer
not
risking
a
bottle
the
draft
version
id
bold
tasting
and
caramel
seeps
through
with
some
sugar
this
would
be
a
malty
mess
if
it
was
not
for
some
apparent
dryhopping
bouncing
off
the
sweet
with
some
bitter
dank
hops
that
are
both
floral
and
earthy
with
sweet
pineapple
and
papaya
i
really
like
how
this
blends
the
feel
is
to
die
for
off
the
spout
a
big
bulky
medium
body
with
active
bubbles
going
down
pretty
much
perfect
with
no
trace
of
alcohol
by
god
i
wish
i
had
a
sixtle
of
this
in
my
basement
it
would
be
a
once
a
day
thing
for
me
a
good
beer
definitly
good
to
the
last
drop
but
for
me
the
abv
is
getting
into
the
defcon
3
area
use
extreme
caution
o
this
is
a
very
good
double
red
overall
a
slight
alcohol
heat
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tounge
better
for
a
fallwinter
hoppy
brew
than
the
heat
of
the
summerbut
something
i
wouldnt
mind
grabbing
again
final
thought
at
9
and
5
a
bottle
being
from
port
brew
this
beer
is
a
must
plus
i
heard
pb
was
discontinuing
this
beer
get
it
while
you
can
overall
a
nice
flavorful
red
ale
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
nugget
nectar
but
how
many
beers
do
in
the
end
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
a
really
good
beer
that
if
cleaned
up
a
bit
would
be
really
excellent
im
not
sure
if
it
was
the
bottle
or
what
but
it
was
sitting
quietly
in
the
fridge
and
wasnt
jostled
at
all
id
love
to
try
it
again
a
bit
fresher

the
craft
brewing
scene
is
an
exhausting
race
to
a
constantly
shifting
finish
line
any
lead
is
eroded
quickly
by
imitation
or
superior
offerings
from
competitors
one
way
to
sidestep
this
is
to
redefine
the
terms
of
competitive
advantage
port
brewing
was
among
the
first
to
go
hoppy
and
once
others
caught
on
they
were
also
among
the
first
to
go
big
while
most
of
those
big
offerings
work
this
one
not
so
much
try
one
of
their
big
ipas
instead
o
i
liked
this
brew
but
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
put
in
the
future
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
and
would
like
to
try
more
of
ports
other
offerings
overall
i
was
slightly
disappointed
with
shark
attack
perhaps
its
the
style
that
i
dont
care
for
i
think
i
prefer
an
amber
ale
to
be
more
refreshing
than
i
find
here
i
know
thats
not
a
very
precise
criticism
but
its
all
this
newbie
can
muster
maybe
its
the
time
of
year
i
might
enjoy
this
more
in
the
winter
very
nice
worth
seeking
out
overall
the
beer
was
good
but
i
cannot
recommend
it
fresh
as
it
is
just
too
over
the
top
in
alcohol
and
bitterness
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
would
taste
in
a
year
or
maybe
more
to
see
if
it
becomes
more
balanced
but
the
fact
that
it
is
not
readily
available
to
me
for
a
decent
price
on
the
east
coast
i
may
never
know
pours
a
cloudy
amber
red
color
into
my
pint
glass
about
four
fingers
of
orangish
head
rests
above
the
amber
smell
consists
of
lots
of
caramel
and
malt
mouthfeel
starts
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
and
then
ends
with
a
bite
alcohol
taste
and
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
not
a
fan
of
this
in
the
least
a
malt
bomb
with
a
booze
finish
poor
attempt
body
is
pretty
thick
and
carbonation
is
fairly
medium
but
the
alcohol
strength
keeps
this
beer
from
being
overly
drinkable
o
good
but
not
great
seemed
like
nugget
nectar
light
light
wish
the
hops
had
been
a
bit
more
present
on
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
profile
overall
at
first
the
beer
came
across
as
a
little
harsh
and
boozy
but
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
glass
and
it
got
warmer
i
was
really
enjoying
the
flavour
its
packed
full
of
taste
and
i
would
suggest
splitting
a
bomber
with
a
friend
medium
bodied
fine
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
on
the
tongue
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
one
although
a
bit
boozy
but
i
was
still
into
it
as
with
anything
ive
had
from
this
brewery
its
got
a
ton
of
flavor
but
isnt
a
novelty
exhibits
complexity
but
is
also
balanced
and
is
just
totally
delicious
im
a
shark
fatality
thumbs
up
the
aroma
was
sweet
nice
touches
of
caramel
malts
and
an
almost
candy
like
sweetness
that
was
wrapped
up
nicely
in
a
bit
of
a
grassy
earthy
hop
like
nose
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
but
i
have
to
admit
i
am
impressed
here
with
this
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
here
a
bit
of
a
hotness
that
i
have
not
seen
in
the
rest
of
the
their
beers
lots
of
grainy
malts
touches
of
light
caramel
and
a
mostly
understated
hop
flavor
lingering
taste
of
hot
alcohol
and
grain
left
me
hanging
again
as
well
as
i
really
was
expecting
more
from
this
here
then
the
hops
come
in
and
balance
and
smooth
it
right
over
very
nicely
done
this
is
a
great
caramelbready
tasting
beer
that
has
a
surprising
complementary
hop
attack
if
you
like
bitter
this
is
for
you
but
it
is
not
a
very
balanced
brew
this
would
go
ok
with
a
pepperoni
pizza
actually
it
is
a
big
bold
red
without
apology
i
really
didnt
like
this
brew
the
balance
was
way
off
not
an
overly
drinkable
beer
the
candy
sweet
malt
and
the
muted
hops
dont
make
for
a
great
combination
in
my
mind
this
is
a
great
beer
in
a
very
open
catchall
category
i
feel
like
i
know
what
port
was
looking
for
out
of
this
beer
and
the
vast
flavor
and
aroma
characteristics
give
the
drinker
something
to
think
about
and
enjoy
d
the
flavors
make
this
seem
lighter
and
more
drinkable
but
the
body
makes
it
drink
like
a
barleywine
aroma
is
strong
and
hoppy
rather
like
an
ipa
with
hints
of
malt
and
herbs
it
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
thick
fluffy
pale
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
flavor
is
fairly
hoppy
but
barely
bitter
and
has
some
maltiness
and
subtle
sweetness
as
well
as
a
hint
of
wood
flavor
is
silver
smooth
with
a
subtle
tingle
and
it
leaves
a
bit
of
a
fizz
plus
some
hoppy
hints
sessionable
heavens
no
but
if
youre
keen
on
imperial
red
ale
this
is
a
fantastic
example
not
enough
to
drag
me
from
my
beloved
lagunitas
lucky
13
but
nonetheless
an
excellent
bevvy
great
red
ale
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
but
9
abv
i
new
it
had
to
be
big
pours
a
huge
rocky
head
very
dark
red
almost
black
in
color
the
taste
is
exceptional
sweet
caramel
and
a
pleasant
flowery
hop
presence
a
little
spicy
too
i
will
be
recommending
this
beer
for
sure
thankfully
the
bitterness
didnt
linger
or
build
and
the
carbonation
kept
it
fairly
crisp
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
as
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
glad
i
tried
it
a
solid
red
from
the
folks
at
port
try
one
over
the
top
crystal
and
west
coast
hops
give
this
beer
a
nice
flavor
profile
its
a
little
bit
spicy
and
piny
but
with
enough
crystal
to
back
it
up
d
not
bad
but
i
wont
pick
it
up
again
just
a
bit
too
boozy
and
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
the
9
abv
will
sneak
up
quickly
this
isnt
your
dads
red
ale
this
is
the
red
you
should
be
bringing
to
a
party
or
significant
social
gathering
this
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
reds
ive
had
the
luxury
of
being
able
to
enjoy
i
suggest
you
get
a
bottle
of
your
own
and
enjoy
it
d
it
was
a
sipper
for
sure
but
the
most
unique
port
beer
ive
tried
so
far
the
beer
had
a
medium
to
full
feel
to
it
with
the
exact
right
carbonation
the
beer
was
smooth
very
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
especially
given
the
elevated
abv
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
will
be
heading
back
to
the
beer
store
for
very
soon
so
glad
that
port
brewing
made
it
to
georgia
d
not
quite
as
good
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
back
when
i
had
this
beer
when
i
first
started
trying
good
beers
but
still
one
worth
drinking
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
this
is
pretty
darn
good
overall
while
admittedly
being
a
sucker
for
imperial
reds
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
onpar
with
gordon
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
and
one
well
worth
a
shot
a
pretty
extreme
red
ale
but
also
pretty
well
balanced
more
complex
interesting
and
tasty
than
i
expected
enjoyed
it
d
ok
the
nose
really
hurts
this
one
but
the
dominating
sweetness
and
then
alchohol
doesnt
help
the
situation
i
probably
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
to
friends
though
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
buy
it
courtesy
of
nejaimes
in
ma
poured
ontap
at
the
portlost
abbey
brewery
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
deep
dark
redamber
coloring
with
no
head
there
is
a
smell
of
caramel
and
hops
on
the
nose
and
it
is
nice
and
strong
the
beer
has
a
complex
taste
when
you
first
drink
it
with
a
blend
of
syrup
maple
and
hops
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
the
hops
give
the
beer
a
very
green
flavor
which
is
odd
for
a
red
the
hops
is
especially
present
on
the
forward
tongue
the
beer
remains
smooth
for
the
amount
of
hops
flavors
especially
into
the
finish
with
a
very
light
hoppy
aftertaste
very
good
beer
all
around
overall
i
remember
this
beer
being
hoppier
last
year
but
it
is
still
a
nice
offering
from
another
great
san
diego
brewery

d
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
no
problems
and
good
all
around
i
wonder
what
it
tastes
like
fresh
but
its
good
now
so
whatever
o
in
a
long
day
of
tasting
this
was
one
of
the
unexpected
highlights
ill
be
buying
more
for
myself
pours
a
deep
burnt
copper
with
hints
of
ruby
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
with
great
lacing
aroma
is
great
with
huge
cascade
hop
notes
of
pine
resins
pink
grapefruit
canned
peaches
and
light
berry
notes
with
hints
of
sweet
toffee
malts
flavor
is
wicked
good
with
huge
spicy
piney
hip
notes
up
front
backed
by
big
sweet
toffee
malts
hints
of
passion
fruit
and
sour
cherry
with
an
herbal
mildly
nutty
finish
palate
is
thick
and
stickysweet
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
long
bitter
fruity
finish
overall
a
delicious
bigass
beer
d
it
drank
pretty
damn
good
and
im
glad
that
i
live
pretty
close
to
pizza
port
where
i
can
also
try
some
of
their
offerings
that
dont
arent
bottled
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
crown
with
a
slight
amount
of
bubbles
on
the
beer
smell
is
a
good
mixture
of
malts
with
some
sweetness
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
floral
nature
sneaking
in
behind
feel
is
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
very
good
tasting
red
ale
big
and
bitter
as
hell
but
lacking
the
hop
mouthfeel
just
super
resinous
sticky
and
bitter
underwhelmed
my
expectations
alcohol
was
very
hot
was
very
challenging
and
i
like
big
brews
not
at
all
my
favorite
port
offering
just
hot
woody
bitter
but
without
any
real
appreciable
dimensions
and
interplay
i
might
as
well
just
take
shots
of
hard
liquor
well
no
but
this
was
below
average
for
a
port
beer
i
was
able
to
have
a
few
sips
of
this
on
tap
at
san
clemente
brewery
but
this
review
is
coming
from
the
bottle
it
has
a
great
read
appearance
the
lacing
is
heavey
around
the
sides
and
remains
smells
of
hops
very
nice
smell
even
a
bit
floral
taste
wooo
very
strong
crystal
malt
flavor
very
sweet
but
the
hops
quickly
start
to
dominate
in
the
bitter
flavor
department
this
beer
is
grat
at
9
im
a
fan
of
anything
that
tastes
this
good
and
will
get
me
messed
up
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
and
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
i
liked
the
hoppiness
it
had
which
doesnt
seem
typical
for
the
style
but
worked
well
d
this
was
a
nice
surprise
port
brewing
to
me
is
fantastic
and
have
yet
to
let
me
down
on
anything
i
have
had
from
them
just
wish
they
came
to
indiana
thats
all
dpretty
drinkable
a
malty
alternative
to
ports
regular
ipa
brilliant
reddish
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
hung
around
for
a
fairly
long
time
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
large
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
i
smell
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
with
notes
of
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
this
is
complimented
by
the
sweet
malt
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
plenty
of
malt
in
the
flavor
as
well
it
is
needed
to
carry
the
hop
load
this
beer
brings
but
it
comes
at
a
price
and
that
price
is
the
alcohol
a
lot
of
warmth
and
flavor
that
sort
of
spoils
the
rest
of
the
party
as
it
seems
i
can
only
taste
the
booze
after
awhile
it
is
out
of
place
in
a
red
ale
and
keeps
me
from
enjoying
the
hops
and
malt
dipas
can
pull
this
off
most
of
the
time
but
not
this
beer
the
body
is
bigger
than
almost
all
others
in
the
style
and
nicely
paired
carbonation
i
am
a
lover
of
hoppedup
red
ales
but
this
one
is
just
too
boozy
for
me
to
enjoy
d
a
decent
amber
ale
would
try
again
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
redtinged
amber
color
there
was
a
very
small
offwhite
head
on
it
that
didnt
leave
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
some
piney
hops
and
a
ton
of
malts
some
fruity
esters
hanging
around
in
there
also
the
taste
is
really
good
a
ton
of
malts
without
too
much
sweetness
the
hops
give
a
slight
dryness
to
the
finish
to
a
slightly
sweet
start
some
caramel
dark
fruits
very
well
balanced
this
drinks
very
easy
d
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
alcoholic
in
the
taste
i
really
enjoyed
the
rest
of
the
taste
i
love
big
reds
but
its
too
hot
for
me
overall
the
brew
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
i
just
didnt
enjoy
all
the
different
fruity
malt
and
possibly
yeasty
sweetness
this
brew
had
i
couldnt
finish
my
glass
and
wouldnt
try
this
again

followed
by

with

make

brew

it
up

there
is

this
beer
that
initially
wasnt
appealing
but
luckily
got
better
as
i
drained
this

medium

heavy

with
healthy
carbonation

evidence
while
i
liked
this
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
d
decent
drinkability
i
ordered
a
second
glass
with
such
big
contributions
of
malts
hops
and
yeast
i
am
surprised
by
how
prominent
the
alcohol
component
remains
its
just
too
aggressive
for
an
amber
ale
regardless
of
the
abv
there
are
plenty
of
intriguing
flavors
and
aromas
that
should
in
my
opinion
do
a
better
job
burying
the
heat
a
a
light
layer
of
thick

spots
of

the

holds
it
back
for
me
a
good
high
octane
west

red
none
the
less
taste
is
immediately
of
an
almost
fruity

well
mixed
with

with
a

sticks
to

a

waiting
for
me
in
the

drinkability
i
went
with
a
more
moderate
number
here
due
to
the
higher
abv
and
weight
of
this
beer
i
really
like
the
imperial
aspect
of
the
amber
and
think
its
very
much
like
one
of
my
current
favorites
terrapins
big
hoppy
monster
just
more
boozy
an
excellent
offering
and
if
i
come
across
it
im
picking
it
up
again
overall
this
was
missing
something
although
it
does
present
some
raw
and
unabashed
aggressive
hop
character
to
my
mind
this
needs
to
be
balanced
with
something
and
it
was
missing
from
the
flavour
anxious
to
try
this
after
reading
a
good
review
on
my
daily
beer
calendar

on
the
initial

followed
by
some

and
a
kick

bittering
spicy

on

followed
by
a
long
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
major
flavor
in
this
monster
i
like
the
overall
bold
bitterness
on
this
brew
drinkability
was
very
easy
as
a
bomber
was
consumed
and
two
could
have
been
taken
down
if
i
had
another
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
will
be
consuming
again
and
a
great
take
on
the
red
ale
category
give
it
a
shot
and
gaze
at
the
sweet
artwork
on
the
label
as
you
consume
a
good
dose
of
caramel
and
bready
maltiness
followed
buy
hop
bitterness
a
little
grapefruit
and
alcohol
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
would
stick
with
some
other
of
the
breweries
offerings
very
drinkable
for
9
and
damn
tasty
nice
hoppiness
coupled
with
some
tasty
malts
exactly
what
i
want
when
i
want
a
double
red
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
bomber
into
a
nonic
hazy
unfiltered
crimsonhued
with
a
small
bonecolored
head
pine
and
spice
are
redolent
its
like
a
fresh
christmas
tree
there
isnt
much
sweetness
to
speak
of
a
touch
of
burnt
caramel
perhaps
and
a
bit
of
juicy
grapefruit
very
resiny
on
the
tongue
the
hop
character
is
substantial
with
pine
red
grapefruit
and
tobacco
flavors
the
malt
foundation
is
solid
lightly
roasty
and
more
dry
than
sweet
its
a
bit
of
a
sipper
really
the
combination
of
heavy
dark
malts
strong
alcohol
and
even
stronger
resiny
hop
bitterness
wear
down
the
palate
in
time
but
its
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
reminiscent
of
fresh
double
bastard
but
not
as
good
pours
a
red
amber
with
slight
cloudiness
red
hued
tan
foam
obvious
carbonation
aroma
is
hopcentric
with
pine
flora
and
spicy
notes
next
to
a
backdrop
of
toffee
assertive
hops
in
the
flavor
as
well
spicy
herbal
hops
as
well
as
floral
ones
with
rose
and
geranium
the
spicy
hops
mix
with
the
alcohol
and
this
one
is
a
bit
warming
with
a
cookielike
malt
and
floral
finish
medium
to
heavy
in
body
maybe
carbonation
is
a
bit
heavy
it
clashes
with
the
spicy
hops
a
bit
i
may
prefer
to
drink
this
particular
beer
with
a
couple
months
of
age
on
it
to
taste
more
like
a
traditional
double
red
ale
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
i
confess
as
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
tends
to
limit

not

my
favorite
imperial

this
is
an
exceptional
beer
worth
driving
from
beervana
to
the
couv
for
my
favorite
red
out
there
at
the
moment
until
it
gets
warm
keep
this
cool
for
optimum
taste
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
really
impressed
by
how
dark
and
unfilted
this
red
ended
out
to
be
the
smell
really
got
me
excited
it
had
that
rich
hoppy
yet
malty
scent
that
most
good
reds
have
the
taste
was
rich
and
full
bodied
the
best
red
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
the
mouthfeel
was
good
not
too
carbonated
but
not
flat
it
was
drinkable
however
the
next
time
i
grabbed
it
i
unfortunately
allowed
it
to
warm
up
a
bit
and
it
was
hard
to
bear
overall
this
is
definitely
a
great
brew
a
well
balanced
red
that
tells
a
story
port
makes
some
fantastic
stuff
and
this
is
another
stellar
one
from
these
guys
will
be
getting
more
of
this
one
22oz
bottle
dark
redbrown
with
a
thick
beige
head
hoppy
and
sweet
aroma
the
flavor
has
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
good
deal
of
citrucy
hops
though
the
sweetness
overpowers
a
bit
thick
in
the
mouth
quite
similar
to
the
yulesmith
that
i
had
the
night
before
though
with
a
bit
better
balance
still
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
and
very
mild
and
fine
spacious
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
for
a
second
or
two
and
rolls
to
pine
sap
and
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
fairly
bitter
but
distinct
flavors
can
be
ascertained
each
swallow
not
a
very
boozy
beer
even
at
9

abv
man
i
luv
these
beers
imperial
reds
because
that
is
what
this
is
are
quickly
becoming
a
major
fav
clear
deep
coppery
colour
with
an
amberred
hue
and
a
fine
light
tan
cap
great
head
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
decent
aroma
with
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
citrus
and
grapefruit
solid
bitterness
flavours
of
citrusy
hops
caramel
and
grapefruit
combined
to
give
it
a
fruity
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
smooth
a
bit
creamy
in
texture
overall
a
good
red
ale
with
well
hidden
alcohol
not
bad
i
had
some
homemade
excellent
peanut
brittle
beforehand
so
i
guess
my
tasting
apparatus
is
biased
nonetheless
poured
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
nice
clear
walnut
aroma
is
malty
and
hoppy
flavor
is
fairly
bitter
and
not
all
that
well
balanced
some
heavy
dark
bitter
syrup
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
ok
not
my
fav
flav
combo
not
so
sure
itd
work
too
well
for
cooking
session
beer
mmm
maybe
proly
not
the
beer
is
lowmedium
carbonated
and
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
with
that
being
said
it
has
just
the
right
weight
for
the
style
which
lends
itself
to
a
highly
quaffable
character
pours
an
extremely
dark
red
with
a
one
finger
head
that
has
no
real
retention
lacing
is
left
even
on
this
poorly
washed
glass
smells
and
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
barleywine
huge
malts
sweetness
some
hops
bitterness
and
an
almost
candy
like
smell
the
malt
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
big
for
me
there
is
just
nothing
special
here
for
taste
or
smell
the
hops
are
earthy
no
real
citrus
in
here
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
moderate
body
and
creamy
and
matches
the
taste
pretty
well
some
alcohol
warming
compliments
citrus
and
caramel
explosion
this
beer
a
bright
hazy
redamber
with
a
creamy
ecru
head
the
aroma
is
like
a
big
citric
american
hop
dipped
in
caramel
theres
a
splash
of
acetone
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
hops
dominate
the
aroma
somewhat
but
the
malt
comes
out
in
the
flavor
the
beer
is
just
the
right
level
of
sweet
for
its
substyle
id
put
this
beer
just
a
half
step
or
so
behind
the
wonderful
winter
yulesmith
i
must
say
34
of
the
way
through
the
bottle
as
it
begins
to
warm
its
becoming
a
much
smoother
drinker
and
more
enjoyable
maybe
i
started
this
one
at
to
cold
of
a
temp
i
dont
know
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
too
overwhelming
i
would
love
if
it
had
a
bigger
hop
presence
but
it
is
what
it
is
drinkability
lovely
flavoursome
beer
with
rich
powerful
flavours
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
enjoys
a
brew
with
multiple
hop
profiles
d
sure
you
couldnt
pound
these
back
all
night
but
its
a
great
beer
to
share
a
22
oz
bottle
with
someone
and
slowly
enjoy
pours
a
hazy
medium
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
lingers
the
smell
is
mainly
malty
with
some
caramel
and
bready
malts
i
didnt
detect
any
hops
in
the
aroma
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warmed
the
hop
aroma
came
out
the
taste
is
caramel
but
also
some
piney
hop
character
and
alcohol
i
would
say
the
hops
and
alcohol
are
the
two
most
detectable
traits
in
the
flavor
the
beer
has
lots
of
carbonation
in
it
which
works
well
for
this
style
for
a
beer
that
is
9
this
is
pretty
drinkable
although
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
than
23
glasses
in
a
sitting
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
red
to
sit
with
for
a
while
do
i
like
this
beer
well
sort
of
its
tasty
its
challenging
but
it
is
just
do
damned
big
that
it
becomes
sort
of
hard
to
drink
do
i
judge
it
on
its
technical
merit
which
is
considerable
or
do
i
judge
it
on
how
much
i
will
be
longing
for
a
big
glass
of
it
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
which
i
will
not
be
at
all
harrumph
difficult
to
decide
a
pleasing
body
coats
the
tongue
without
being
heavy
or
sticky
drinkability
is
good
but
id
probably
get
bored
having
more
than
a
couple
worth
trying
overall
seems
unfinished
or
maybe
just
not
fresh
out
of
a
bottle
at
home
seems
like
they
just
threw
a
bunch
of
malthops
at
this
brew
not
really
balancing
out
for
a
real
style
i
may
just
not
be
a
fan
of
imperial
red
ales
either
though
or
it
may
be
better
fresh
traders
note
thanks
again
to
rodburg
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
fine
brew
from
cali
d
this
is
a
big
bold
red
ale
the
hops
and
malt
are
both
vying
for
attention
and
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
much
for
me
not
a
poorlymade
beer
by
any
means
even
considering
the
off
notes
on
the
nose
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
brew
out
again
it
would
pair
well
with
a
mediumrare
steak
an
english
farmhouse
cheddar
or
with
bbq
pours
a
very
hazy
amber
color
it
may
be
a
bit
of
chill
haze
as
it
cleared
a
little
throughout
the
drink
but
the
second
pour
was
hazy
and
the
tiny
window
of
clarity
was
still
a
bit
hazed
the
head
is
very
nice
big
and
pillowy
almost
yellow
colored
and
it
collapses
to
a
nice
little
pad
which
only
surprisingly
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
the
haziness
still
gets
to
me
though
the
smell
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
pungent
hops
grassy
and
piney
with
a
nice
resinous
presence
with
notes
of
citrus
peel
and
rind
but
actually
the
hoppy
smells
seem
to
get
upstaged
a
bit
by
the
malt
complexity
i
can
smell
a
nice
toasty
sweetness
caramel
and
even
a
sort
of
cakey
smell
reminds
me
a
bit
of
pineapple
upside
down
cake
which
really
makes
me
want
to
dig
in
the
taste
comes
back
with
a
bit
of
the
upside
down
cake
too
but
it
sort
of
turns
into
something
else
quickly
theres
a
kind
of
sweet
syrupy
taste
slightly
roasted
and
caramelized
hopped
up
with
some
grassiness
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
but
plenty
of
resin
in
the
taste
it
turns
back
into
cakey
and
bready
tasting
in
the
finish
along
with
some
burnt
pinapple
and
some
lemonorange
flavor
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
it
isnt
the
same
as
in
some
other
high
abv
beers
the
taste
of
it
i
mean
the
body
is
nice
and
full
almost
too
much
so
but
i
really
like
it
the
hops
sort
of
help
to
keep
it
in
balance
and
the
complexity
is
very
good
i
like
the
cakey
feeling
of
it
the
drinkability
is
good
i
mean
it
was
very
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
but
its
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
to
see
myself
wanting
more
i
doubt
if
i
would
want
another
one
for
a
few
days
but
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
like
hopped
up
red
ales
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
murky
cloud
of
reddish
brown
muck
the
head
is
decent
sized
but
disipates
into
a
thin
tan
cover
with
a
blanketing
lace
the
aroma
is
hugely
malty
and
piny
hop
perfectly
blended
thick
and
edible
sweet
and
serious
the
taste
is
big
and
bold
with
tart
piny
bitterness
and
mellow
chocolate
malt
in
a
thick
flavorfest
theres
grainy
goodness
and
sharp
alcohol
licorice
this
is
smooth
a
bit
resinous
but
powerful
sweet
but
wholesome
awesome
job
once
again
port
has
my
attention
a
little
hefty
to
drink
too
freely
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
amber
chestnut
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
the
head
leaves
a
minimal
lace
on
my
glass
nose
and
flavor
are
of
sticky
caramelized
malt
alcohol
resinous
citrus
lemon
and
grapefruit
a
bit
spicy
which
makes
me
wonder
if
any
rye
malt
was
used
in
this
one
sweet
and
boozy
with
a
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
solid
it
was
not
quite
red
a
little
darker
but
it
was
close
enough
who
really
cares
about
appearance
anyhow
youre
not
going
to
pour
the
beer
into
a
frame
the
carbonation
seemed
to
be
average
for
red
ale
meaning
that
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
strong
and
bold
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
port
brewing
a
bold
combination
of
hops
and
a
strong
mask
of
sweet
malts
are
apparent
by
smell
the
taste
remains
true
to
the
smell
it
was
at
first
a
tad
bit
sweet
it
quickly
turned
to
the
taste
of
the
creative
hop
blend
the
blend
was
quite
bitter
but
had
a
nice
floral
pine
flavor
to
it
the
malt
was
as
sweet
as
the
smell
gave
away
it
had
a
nice
balance
of
the
hop
and
malt
each
seemed
to
have
equal
force
overall
it
is
creative
strong
bold
red
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
red
tint
i
guess
lots
of
frothy
tan
head
smell
is
exceptional
potent
piney
hops
sweet
toffee
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
crisp
toffee
sweet
caramel
and
ripe
fruit
this
is
followed
by
a
sharp
bitter
hoppiness
that
fades
to
a
strong
alcohol
its
actually
a
very
good
blend
tied
together
by
the
hops
i
cant
tell
the
variety
i
think
its
a
combination
of
several
but
its
very
good
the
alcohol
aftertaste
does
take
away
from
the
drinkabiliry
quite
a
strong
beer
and
that
isnt
going
to
give
it
a
super
level
of
drinkability
tasty
beer
but
this
is
intense
and
quite
thick
should
only
be
drank
by
professional
beer
drinkers
that
is
only
half
in
jest
this
is
a
nitro
top
fuel
dragster
of
a
beer
not
something
to
let
granny
drive
pours
out
a
deep
red
almost
mahoganybrown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
highly
of
american
hops
and
alcohol
but
its
hot
aroma
doesnt
really
give
it
a
bad
characteristic
the
taste
is
also
hoppy
with
a
nice
rich
maltiness
it
finishes
bitter
it
has
a
medium
body
and
is
pretty
silky
in
the
mouth
a
bomber
goes
down
a
little
too
easily
i
bet
port
could
call
this
a
red
ipa
for
marketing
purposes
haha
anyway
its
a
great
take
on
the
red
ale
that
is
so
common
on
the
west
coast
d
quite
a
hoppy
amber
but
with
a
huge
malt
counterpart
good
stuff
from
port
i
was
expecting
some
competition
for
nugget
nectar
but
this
doesnt
come
close
in
my
opinion
overall
although
im
generally
prefer
the
ipas
over
the
reds
i
find
this
beer
quite
exceptional
cheers
cheesers
drinkability
this
is
a
very
large
imperial
amber
much
larger
than
nn
yulesmith
and
others
i
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
i
know
my
taste
buds
would
eventually
get
worn
out
i
still
cant
give
this
any
lower
than
a
4
it
called
to
me
drinkability
this
abv
its
not
a
quaffer
however
the
alcohol
is
not
that
present
the
flavor
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
good
i
like
it
d
i
was
let
down
by
this
overall
too
much
booze
and
way
too
sweet
way
drinkable
and
a
must
have
a
favorite
red
for
me
for
sure
just
smooth
and
not
nearly
as
strong
tasting
as
its
stated
9
0
mouthfeel
is
bit
thick
and
syrupy
low
carbonation
which
hurts
the
drinkability
over
all
that
and
the
huge
sweetness
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
a
flavorful
and
complex
ale
balanced
and
unified
alcohol
has
a
slight
warming
presence
but
is
well
hidden
reminded
me
more
of
an
olde
ale
than
a
red
ale
due
to
the
malty
and
musty
quality
hops
lack
the
distinct
sharpness
i
had
expected
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
impression
glad
i
only
had
to
handle
13
of
the
bottle
bordering
on
overly
sweet
would
have
preferred
some
more
hop
balance
22
oz
bottle
brewed
with
a
boatload
of
crystal
malts
and
dosed
with
lethal
amounts
of
hops
it
pours
a
dark
scarlet
unfiltered
with
light
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
there
is
a
heady
aroma
with
stickyresinycitric
hops
pleasing
caramel
a
dash
of
chocolate
and
a
healthy
breath
of
alcohol
surprisingly
malty
later
on
the
palate
there
are
faint
fusels
lots
and
lots
of
sweet
crystal
malts
citric
tropical
and
piney
hops
a
touch
of
mint
and
a
long
bittersweet
finish
it
is
sticky
almost
sugary
lightlydrying
with
ample
carbonation
permeating
its
medium
body
very
hoppy
but
the
sweet
crystals
beat
them
down
and
help
improve
drinkability
right
now
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
prevalent
but
this
will
probably
mellow
out
to
a
nice
barleywine
in
a
year
or
two
port
brewing
strikes
again
excellent
beer
ive
really
liked
every
port
b
ive
tried
so
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
stop
collecting
them
now
d
a
bomber
is
more
than
enough
as
the
booziness
really
kicks
in
i
would
definetly
pick
this
one
up
again
another
impressive
beer
from
port
brewing
there
wasnt
a
shark
attack
that
day
seems
ironic
looking
back
as
though
there
should
have
been
but
this
is
good
enough
this
beer
is
so
original
so
sublime

a

with
bitterness
that
lingers
well
beyond

this
is
well
done
complex
and
nice

ipa
d
eh
its
okay
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
it
worth
a
shot
for
sure
upon
revisiting
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
big
miss
for
port
oh
well
ill
just
have
to
drink
more

red
is
a
decent
beer
and
this
hyped
up
version
is
a
little
too
strong
malty
for
my
taste
try
this
one
while
it
lasts
mine
is
labeled
as
35
for
2013
which
i
notice
is
a
little
different
from
some
of
the
other
release
numbers
i
see
in
these
reviews
but
the
style
is
still
the
same
as
far
as
i
know
it
may
not
be
around
for
long
so
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
this
is

no
clues
on
what
is
cancelled
for

or
whatever
popping
the
top
the
bottle
smell
is
black
licorice
with
alot
of
malts
and
strong
sweetness
pouring
into
the
sapp
yields
a
deep
bronze
with
a
permanent
multi
size
bubble
tan
head
that
is
as
i
said
permanent
taste
is
smoothness
beyond
all
comprehension
will
an
up
front
bittersweet
maltiness
that
then
kicks
into
a
a
sweet
but
mildly
balanced
bitterness
that
then
fades
to
a
slight
bitterness
that
never
exceeds
the
butterscotch
bite
a
fine
brew
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
16
oz
champaign
flute
yields
a
12
head
which
stocks
around
for
a
couple
sips
and
then
leaves
lovely
lacing
in
rings
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
unfiltered
slightly
rubytinted

is

more

overall
i
really
like
this
it
is
quite
a
bit
better
than
the
seasonal
flipside
red
ipa
which
is
a
little
bit
different
style
reddish
amber
colored
with
a
good
inch
of
khaki
colored
head
lively
carbonation
cereal
grains
and
amber
malt
combine
with
pine
like
aromatic
hops
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
warm
the
cereal
grains
and
amber
malts
are
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
are
quickly
drenched
with
intense
pine
hop
flavors
that
burn
a
bit
and
then
fade
intensely
hopped
o
i
tend
to
hate
imperial
reds
because
theyre
so
abrasive
pretty
happy
with
this
o
a
pretty
good
offering
from
sn
its
got
the
big
hop
bitterness
i
expect
from
them
but
not
a
overpowering
as
in
some
of
their
other
beers
but
most
of
those
are
ipas
not
as
good
as
bear
republics
red
rocket
but
i
dont
think
that
is
an
imperial
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
comes
off
as
unfinished
compared
to
what
i
would
normally
expect
from
sierra

releases

citrusy

caramel

alcohol
flavor
is
an
intense
blend
of
specialty
malts
assertive
hop
flavors
and
residual
malt
sweetness
balanced
by
strong
resiny
alpha
acids
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
and
satisfying
overall
a
full
malt
and
hops
experience
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
shouldnt
have
that
musty
hop
flavor
already
as
it
warms
the
booze
comes
out
solid
and

roasted

im

disappointed
by
this
i
love
red

all
the

and
i
really
hoped
that
sierra

would
give
me
a

example
than
this
while
its
still
decent
enough
decent
enough
is

the

set
for

slightly
above

amber
except
for
the
head
not
very
attractive
looking
straight
up
bitter
amber
ale
this
is
really
not
my
idea
of
a
good
red
or
imperial
red
i
like
the
spicy
element
of
the
beer
but
it
just
follows
the
american
over
hopped
variety
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
definitely
lacks
a
bit
of
panache
overall
pretty
nice
another
solid
offering
from
sn
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
beer
camp
series
worth
trying
but
there
are
quite
a
few
other
redsimperial
reds
on
the
market
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
if
they
were
on
the
same
shelf
this
beer

up
a
murky
deep
red
with
a
lucious
two
finger
foamy
caramel
colored
head
awesome
retention
and
world
class
lacing
the
smell
is
pine
floral
citrus
grasses
and
biscuit
taste
is
very
citrus
probably
more
orange
than
grapefruit
some
caramel
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
hops
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
but
not
too
bad
of
one
i
liked
this
one
a

on

mini
snifter

a
moderate

color
with

and
a

of

earth
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
somewhat
bitter
pretty
good
o
not
a
bad
imperial
red
but
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
as
far
as
the
style
id
say
its
on
par
with
most
imperial
reds
though
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
it
is
nice
to
see
sn
putting
out
a
nice
broad
array
of
beer
camp
brews
though
overall
i
think
i
expected
more
from
sierra
nevada
but
this
is
still
a
very
tasty
beer
id
like
a
little
more
citrus
punch
but
maybe
that
would
make
it
more
of
a
ipadipa
glad
to
have
tried
palate
is
a
little
sticky
and
resiny
but
fits
the
flavor
profile
pretty
well
i
dont
think
id
want
to
have
another
one
after
this
though
overall
a
very
tasty
red
ale
more
on
the
bitterhop
side
than
the
citrussweet
side
which
is
just
fine
caramel
malts
play
a
big
role
in
the
balance
and
work
nicely
with
the
pines
through
and
through
another
solid
release
from
the
guys
in
cali
very
nice
effort
from
sn
not
a
hop
bomb
but
very
well
balanced
goes
down
well
for
abv
done
well
clean
consistent
and
easy
and
fun
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
beer
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
imperial
red
pours
out
a
muddy
browntinged
red
color
with
a
finger
of
persistent
head
the
aroma
is
big
and
malty
a
decent
amount
of
the
hop
presence
from
fresh
has
faded
revealing
a
roast
presence
i
dont
really
remember
theres
still
a
solid
amount
of
the
citrus
hop
flavor
on
the
tongue
but
the
malt
really
runs
the
show
here
with
a
toffeecaramelroast
kinda
thing
going
on
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
malty
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
big
and
brash
and
the
drinkability
is
solid
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
never
quite
hit
great
o
a
nice
beer
but
doesnt
rock
my
socks
i
sierra
nevada
makes
a
lot
of
beers
i
likelove
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
ill
happily
drink
the
last
one
of
these
but
i
would
not
look
for
more
o
this
is
an
imperial
red
ale
that
isnt
hopped
up
on
hops
its
just
a
higher
abv
version
that
is
a
mild
balance
to
floral
hops
and
malt
i
really
expected
a
red
ipa
good
not
great
much
more
than
a
red
ale
this
is
more
lke
an
imperial
red
ipa
in
my
opinion
pour
is
brick
red
clear
and
had
an
inch
of
white
head
on
it
the
nose
is
big
american
red
malts
nothing
dry
and
irish
about
this
baby
lots
of
bold
hops
too
big
aroma
on
this
beer
flavor
is
hops
first
malt
second
its
bitter
at
first
especially
for
a
red
but
the
malts
quickly
come
in
to
sweeten
up
the
bitter
and
add
a
huge
layer
of
earthy
depth
its
good
but
the
two
flavors
seem
at
odds
with
eachother
somehow
the
feel
is
quite
airy
really
but
filling
and
heavy
at
the
same
time
its
a
contradiction
that
i
do
not
understand
and
its
one
i
dont
really
like
either
i
can
sip
this
down
easy
but
as
soon
as
i
swallow
it
its
heavy
in
my
gut
also
very
strong
for
a
beer
you
can
hardly
taste
the
booze
in
even
when
its
warm
its
a
cool
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
but
i
like
the
others
in
this
beer
camp
box
better
a
bit
too
boozy
not
too
bad
otherwise
overall
reminds
me
of
a
less
aggressiveless
hoppy
arrogant
bastard
pretty
good
malt
base
to
go
with
plenty
of
pine
and
citrus
bitterness
gave
a
few
hints
of
a
much
lighter
bigfoot
not
nearly
as
much
carameltoffee
as
bigfoot
or
hops
either
but
almost
like
a
second
runnings
brew
the
second
offering
from
this
years
variety
pack
it
pours
a
clear
amberrusset
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
caramel
dark
greens
pine
resin
and
celery
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
caramel
is
less
toasted
the
pine
is
stronger
and
some
grapefruit
peel
has
been
added
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
impy
red
one
thats
not
ashamed
to
be
pleasantly
balanced
o
pretty
decent
for
the
style
although
i
have
seen
it
done
better
ballast
point
tongue
buckler
comes
to
mind
but
a
good
addition
to
the
beer
camp
craft
pack
nonetheless
would
gladly
drink
again
if
someone
handed
me
one
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
super
malty
ipadipa
with
a
gorgeous
color
though
there
is
some
clash
in
the
nose
i
am
not
crazy
about
heavy
body
makes
this
a
one
per
siting
sort
of
beer
for
me
so
one
dimensionally
malty
that
for
a
second
i
catch
a
tinge
of
almost
smoky
porter
malt
o
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
my
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
sampler
great
balance
of
bold
hops
and
malt
with
a
warming
finish
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
remains
a
pillowy
2inch
head
aromas
of
amber
malt
caramel
and
toffee
grassy
hops
tangerine
peel
and
a
touch
of
resin
taste
consists
of
more
amber
malt
candy
grain
and
moderately
bitter
pine
resin
and
grapefruit
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
sticky
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
solid
amber
ale
but
nothing
new
or
revolutionary
beer
is
nice
thick
in
body
and
sweet
through
a
strong
flavored
beer
with
a
good
finish
for
a
big
big
red
ale
it
is
quite
drinkable
could
have
been
a
little
hoppier
even
and
i
would
still
enjoy
it
id
have
this
again
overall
a
very
good
and
very
big
red
ale
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
in
six
packs
soon
o
id
happy
take
this
hop
bomb
over
many
of
the
ipa
on
the
market
o
this
is
a
very
nice
imperial
red
ale

aroma

caramel
sweet

some
traces

taste
is

some

bitterness
mild
malty
sweetness
really
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
just
doesnt
stand
out
but
quite
good
and
a
very
solid
offering
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
solid
it
has
a
nice
chewy
caramel
malt
backbone
and
an
agressive
hopping
that
makes
the
impy
red
style
one
of
my
favorites
recommended
d
this
is
pretty
tasty
my
only
gripe
is
that
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
this
has
a
complex
malt
bill
sweet
malty
and
toasty
along
with
a
complex
hop
profile
which
creates
an
interesting
tugofwar
on
the
palate
still
this
has
something
for
everyone
without
seeming
too
big
to
be
drinkable
this
was
a
good
beer
had
it
as
part
of
this
years
bear
camp
probably
my
second
favorite
in
the
set
the
smell
reminded
me
of
hopps
and
citrus
fruits
it
had
a
moderately
hoppy
taste
sort
of
bittersweetness
the
color
was
reddish
it
was
crisp
i
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing

mainly
of
hops
and
pine
taste
is
piney
hops
up
front
some
alcohol
is
present
malts
kicking
in
near
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
this
ale
is
different
than
any
red
that
i
had
before
enjoyable
with
a
price
of
4
and
limited
availability
i
wont
buy
another
store
only
received
one
case
and
it
was
going
fast
but
i
am
certainly
enjoying
the
one
i
have
o
its
a
good
beer
i
like
imperial
reds
as
they
bring
the
big
flavors
of
an
iipa
but
have
a
bit
more
depth
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
o
its
an
alright
beer
but
nothing
ill
revisit
true
to
its
amber
ale
roots
you
should
try
it
your
opinion
may
differ
overall
really
complex
and
well
balanced
brew
and
a
very
pleasant
surprise
really
has
the
best
of
a
dipa
an
apa
and
a
red
ale
all
rolled
into
one
big
bold
flavors
not
overly
sweet
a
really
nice
beer
to
enjoy
with
the
onset
of
the
cooler
weather
enjoying
this
one
during
monday
night
football
get
the
sampler
pack
i
think
youll
like
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
candied
red
bordering
on
brown
with
a
nice
clear
body
and
a
good
flow
of
carbonation
bubbles
the
head
is
big
rocky
and
mountainous
with
sticky
fat
globs
of
lacing
moving
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
weblike
patterns
the
beer
smells
very
bready
with
a
great
smattering
of
piney
hops
with
hints
of
citrus
caramel
malts
are
also
obviously
present
and
enticing
just
as
any
red
ale
should
be
the
beer
tastes
fantastically
balanced
it
opens
with
sweet
caramel
and
malts
before
opening
into
big
pine
and
grapefruit
bitter
notes
which
transitions
into
the
aftertaste
which
mingles
the
hops
bitter
citruspine
with
the
bready
malts
to
make
a
mellow
bitter
linger
and
sweet
touch
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
medium
bodied
with
light
effervescence
from
the
carbonation
which
helps
to
cleanse
the
palate
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
on
the
tongue
and
roof
with
just
a
trickle
of
saliva
to
leave
the
mouth
calling
out
for
more
liquid
nourishment
overall
this
beer
is
a
lovely
sipper
i
must
admit
that
i
love
hoppy
imperial
reds
and
this
is
very
nice
hoppy
red
granted
the
hops
are
a
little
mellower
than
other
reds
i
have
sampled
this
ale
still
holds
great
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
notes
and
definitely
kisses
the
mouth
with
sweet
caramel
and
bread
malts
in
a
perfect
balancing
act
with
the
hoppy
bitters
try
this
beer
it
is
most
likely
my
favorite
of
beer
camp
this
year
taste
is
sharp
with
a
bitter
grapefruit
hops
character
dominating
the
big
malt
presence
comes
through
later
in
the
finish
smoothing
things
over
a
bit
overall
a
solid
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
brew
o
good
stuff
closer
to
a
strong
ale
i
think
than
an
american
amberred
but
sn
calls
this
an
imperial
red
so
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
o
probably
my
favorite
selection
of
the
12
pack
this
beer
is
full
of
different
characters
yet
they
all
work
together
for
a
great
glass
full
of
beer
o
sweet
red
with
abv
well
hidden
a
tad
bitter
cheers
very
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
cant
taste
the
8
1
percent
alcohol
but
you
can
feel
it
this
is
a
big
beer
that
is
my
favorite
beer
camp
beer
so
far
cloudy
red
color
with
a
good
quantity
of
malt
some
citrus
notes
in
the
hoppy
finish
a
very
well
made
ale
that
i
wish
i
could
buy
more
of
o
overall
a
bit
too
earthy
for
me
although
ambers
arent
my
favorite
i
do
enjoy
a
good
take
on
the
style
and
this
one
is
a
bit
boozy
and
way
too
heavy
on
the
grains
dark
slightly
hazy
amber
clingy
lace
nose
is
floral
zesty
spicy
hops
clinging
to
a
sturdy
malt
base
of
dark
toasted
grains
and
toffee
low
carbonation
smooth
on
the
palate
flavor
is
moderately
bitter
on
the
approach
but
the
malt
is
pretty
much
center
stage
on
the
front
end
very
toasty
and
medium
sweet
spicy
herbal
hops
come
on
stronger
through
the
middle
and
hit
their
most
potent
in
the
finish
the
beer
dries
out
as
the
bitterness
intensifies
leaving
a
nice
finish
reminds
me
of
a
malty
up
celebration
ale
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
simple
but
tasty
o
wont
kick
it
out
of
a
glass
quite
enjoyable
but
is
missing
something
to
put
it
over
the
top
overall
reminds
me
of
six
month
old
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
the
beer
is
mildly
hazy
and
appears
copper
to
amber
in
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
ample
sticky
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
brings
malt
slightly
sweet
pine
hops
intensely
bitter
with
prominent
piney
hop
flavors
a
tad
sweet
with
some
fruity
maly
offerings
a
bit
of
alcoholic
warmth
persists
after
each
sip
typical
sn
hop
and
flavor
profile
overall
this
was
ok
o
solid
amber
definitely
on
the
hoppy
bitter
side
refreshing
and
smooth
but
firm
and
chewy
d
pretty
good
i
like
it
overall
it
isnt
fantastic
among
the
imperial
red
ale
style
which
i
love
beer
camp
variety
is
reasonably
priced
so
i
will
likely
have
it
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
large
beautiful
tan
head
which
has
good
retention
and
a
nice
consistency
the
smells
are
of
caramel
some
grassy
hops
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
thickness
the
taste
is
excellent
a
load
of
sweet
caramel
followed
by
a
load
of
bitterness
a
great
beer
certainly
an
interesting
beer
but
i
think
it
needs
a
little
polish
around
the
edges
to
be
great
overall
this
beer
seems
full
of
surprises
each
step
of
the
reviewing
process
seems
to
throw
a
twist
into
the
plot
decent
effort
here
speaking
from
a
hopheads
perspective
but
dont
give
this
one
to
a
light
lager
drinker
pours
a
dark
red
crimsom
color
some
white
foam
resides
with
a
ring
around
nose
is
redcaramel
and
toffee
blend
there
is
a
bitter
hop
that
bursts
through
with
the
sweet
malt
and
takes
hold
really
robust
red
ale
good
pretty
standard
for
an
imperial
redamber
balanced
and
easy
drinking
for
8
1
solid
but
nothing
groundbreaking
o
well
executed
and
enjoyable
everything
form
this
years
beer
camp
box
has
been
great
so
far
cant
wait
for
the
next
edition
this
was
hands
down
my
fav
of
the
2012
beer
camp
bunch
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
for
an
imperialstrength
red
ale
i
feel
like
if
the
brewers
had
emphasized
the
toastiness
and
caramel
character
more
than
the
biscuit
i
would
really
love
it
o
this
was
my
least
favorite
in
the
beer
camp
2012
box
available
in
my
area
perhaps
i
was
searching
for
something
the
brewers
didnt
intend
o
bitter
and
malty
blah
theres
a
good
kick
of
grapefruit
starting
things
off
closely
matched
by
some
malt
sweetness
but
i
find
it
pretty
bitter
overall
this
like
the
other
beer
camp
beers
of
2012
ive
tried
all
seem
to
have
a
fence
that
dont
let
the
flavours
really
shine
to
be
frank
i
wouldnt
seek
any
of
them
out
if
they
showed
up
in
individual
6
packs
oh
well
thats
just
me
i
guess
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
rubyred
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
clingy
offwhite
head
that
coats
the
surface
and
any
of
the
glass
it
touches
aromas
of
roasted
caramel
nutty
highlights
and
a
touch
of
hops
to
keep
everything
clean
and
tight
flavors
are
rich
and
malty
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
strong
hop
presence
on
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
hops
are
slightly
resiny
and
citrusy
with
enough
bitterness
to
counterbalance
the
rich
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
sweet
malt
profile
extremely
well
balanced
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
sweetness
with
a
clean
smooth
finish
that
leaves
only
a
trace
linger
behind
well
done
campers
o
really
n
a
fan
of
his
style
put
this
was
pretty
tasty
and
well
crafted
its
very
sweet
with
a
great
depth
of
flavor
it
just
isnt
my
favorite
due
to
the
high
red
malt
profile
for
me
it
needed
more
warm
roasty
flavors
still
its
complex
and
tasty
and
hid
the
8
1
well
worth
trying
o
good
drinkability
for
a
borderline
imperial
red
big
malts
not
too
heavy
on
the
hops
a
lot
better
than
the
floral
ipa
right
up
there
with
the
pilsner
and
oat
stout
might
be
the
best
in
the
bunch
what
happened
the
imperial
pils
was
clean
lovely
this
beer
feels
like
it
was
left
on
simmer
for
a
couple
hours
too
long
not
very
good
o
i
think
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
maybe
my
favorite
out
of
the
beer
camp
pack
medium
bodied
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
up
front
that
provides
some
earthy
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
dry
finish
resinous
with
a
grassy
pine
needle
flavor
along
with
a
very
faint
citrus
fruit
presence
the
malt
flavors
are
a
bit
strong
for
my
liking
but
they
dont
really
interfere
with
the
hops
theres
a
strong
caramel
flavor
along
with
some
toffee
nut
and
biscuit
nicely
balanced
with
a
well
masked
abv
but
i
was
expected
a
bit
more
complexity
o
not
the
best
hoppy
red
and
not
the
best
sweet
red
but
this
is
a
sort
of
blend
of
the
two
i
actually
like
it
quite
a
bit
sometimes
i
have
a
hard
time
understanding
the
difference
in
a
hoppy
red
and
an
ipa
this
beer
lets
the
difference
be
known
a
quality
beer
and
worth
checking
out
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
more
it
turned
out
to
be
my
least
favorite
in
the
beer
camp

moderately

lingers
after

body
with
a
fairly
creamy

and
lightly
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
imperial
red
ale
decent
complexity
and
balance
of
flavors
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
gravity
the
flavor
profile
balance
and
complexity
wasnt
on
par
to
what
i
was
hoping
to
get
a
great
take
on
the
style
very
deep
malt
bill
with
supporting
hops
very
raw
but
in
robust
and
elegant
way
i
really
liked
this
one
o
a
good
imperial
red
that
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
in
4
packs
of
cans
like
torpedo
recommended
tastebig
dose
of
citrus
hops
grapefruit
faint
peach
toasted
malt
in
the
background
but
mostly
hopforward
very
tasty
found
this
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
the
look
is
a
dark
but
clear
rosy
mahogany
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
and
a
wash
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
malt
vinegar
and
grassy
earthy
grains
a
bit
tart
and
likeable
enough
the
flavor
offers
an
intense
grass
hop
and
malt
vinegar
blend
with
a
grainy
near
butterscotch
touch
its
medium
bodied
with
gentle
carbonation
and
a
vaguely
resinous
feel
overall
a
lovely
brew
that
i
can
recommend
for
a
nice
combination
of
tart
and
hoppy
o
what
a
great
concoction
of
toasted
sweet
malts
and
ferocious
fruity
hops
the
hop
profile
is
sublime
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
gotta
say
this
is
one
terrific
take
on
the
style
overall
a
slow
sipping
beer
that
is
hearty
nice
flavors
but
not
overpowering
of
the
four
beers
that
came
in
the
beer
camp
12pack
this
was
the
one
i
looked
forward
to
the
most
unfortunately
it
ends
up
being
the
least
impressive
of
the
four
this
is
fine
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
but
not
bad
in
any
way
just
doesnt
seem
to
come
together
as
i
hoped
for
love
a
good
imperial
red
and
this
is
a
good
one
d
kind
of
lacking
in
hop
character
for
an
imperial
red
the
malt
is
excessively
sweet
and
lacking
in
depth
which
means
that
it
further
obscures
the
hops
another
dissapointment
from
this
years
beer
camp
pack
overall
this
is
a
solid
amber
but
not
particularly
great
oa
good
red
ale
malt
was
strong
but
could
have
had
more
subtle
flavors
beautiful
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
on
top
of
brown
sugar
molasses
and
a
firm
but
not
overbearing
bitterness
that
brings
it
home
to
a
nice
smooth
finish
medium
bodied
and
mediumlow
carbonation
make
this
super
easy
to
drink
surprisingly
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
extremely
wellmade
very
good
try
some
this
isnt
one
of
the
best
sierra
nevada
products
i
have
ever
had
but
it
certainly
isnt
bad
for
the
relatively
high
abv
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
quite
light
on
the
flavor
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
if
it
were
a
full
time

the
best
in

category
from
what
i
have
tried
and
the
hop
character
though
balanced
isnt
very
complex
still
worth
trying
in
a
nice
beer
camp
year
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
was
a
bit
let
down
i
was
thinking
this
would
perhaps
be
like
lucky

brian

or

unfortunately
it
was
not
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
pack
this
year
but
even
so
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
hopforward
red
ale
but
still
well
balanced
with
the
malts
quite
tasty
overall
a
very
well
done
ipared
ale
good
mix
of
hops
and
a
good
malt
balance
nice
undertones
of
roast
o
id
call
it
a
red
ipa
a
bit
all
over
the
place
but
pretty
tasty
none
the
less
although
the
hops
are
higher
than
normal
for
style
which
is
welcomed
its
the
malt
profile
that
i
enjoy
the
most
its
good
and
worth
trying
but
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
slightly
below
average
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
stand
out
one
the
darker
roasted
malts
seemed
a
little
overdone
and
overshadowed
the
hoppiness
for
me
unfortunately
this
is
a
pretty
decent
red
ale
id
drink
my
share
of
these
and
maybe
a
bit
more
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
red
copper
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
fine
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malt
piney
and
herbal
hops
citrus
interesting
caramel
malt
and
complex
hop
flavor
with
different
hop
flavors
slowly
revealing
themselves
into
an
herbal
hop
and
light
malt
finish
a
hint
of
rye
sourness
i
was
expecting
a
more
intense
hop
flavor
from
the
aroma
but
instead
the
malts
and
hops
are
very
nicely
integrated
i
greatly
enjoyed
the
slow
revealing
of
of
the
hop
flavors
a
nice
creamy
medium
body
this
is
a
very
nice
classic
red
ale
with
good
balance
in
the
components
i
love
sierra
nevada
o
overall
an
enjoyable
nice
beer
that
i
would
have
again
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
solid
nonetheless
oi
like
this
a
lot
as
an
imperial
re
ale
im
impressed
because
most
big
red
ale
are
just
essentially
ipas
but
this
maintains
all
the
good
characteristics
of
a
red
ale
its
a
but
hoppy
yes
but
its
just
a
slight
addition
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
mahoganyamber
color
with
a
two
inch
rocky
creamcolored
head
embedded
with
craters
and
a
network
of
honeycombs
visible
along
the
sides
head
gradually
dissipates
into
a
consistent
eigth
inch
skim
leaving
textured
delicates
sheets
of
lacing
as
the
brew
recedes
nose
expresses
citrus
rind
and
earthy
spice
with
a
suggestion
of
caramel
malt
in
the
background
taste
reveals
an
herbalresinous
character
on
a
malty
backbone
however
the
hops
quality
definitely
asserts
itself
more
than
the
malt
theres
a
slight
rindlike
bitterness
at
the
finish
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
brisk
carbonation
and
a
slight
oiliness
more
and
more
i
find
myself
buying
from
this
brewery
the
quality
variety
and
price
point
are
exceptional
that
said
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
per
se
but
quite
enjoyable
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
red
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
of
the
west
coast
variety
its
a
very
bitter
beer
but
the
hops
have
a
nice
flowery
aftertaste
i
think
i
smell
and
taste
oak
somewhere
in
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
medium
body
feels
nice
i
feel
like
there
isnt
much
complexity
to
this
beer
but
its
at
least
a
solid
offering
which
cant
be
said
for
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
beer
camp
package
aw
yeah
this
is
a
really
good
imperial
red
recommended
o
a
malty
imperial
red
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
though
i
prefer
my
red
ales
on
the
hoppy
side
o
one
of
these
is
all
i
can
drink
in
a
sitting
just
too
overly
bitter
with
out
a
lot
of
flavor
to
back
it
up
leaves
my
taste
buds
thinking
that
i
just
ate
some
burnt
toast
md
the
mouth
on
this
is
nice
with
a
medium
feel
and
a
bit
of
carb
which
i
think
works
perfectly
the
abv
is
8
1
which
is
a
bit
higher
than
most
reds
but
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
i
would
knock
back
12
a
sixer
easily
this
is
alright
overall
at
8
i
was
surprised
by
the
amount
of
alcohol
that
presents
itself
on
the
palate
i
thought
it
may
have
been
closer
to
10
or
11
until
i
read
the
bottle
not
very
impressed
o
pretty
tasty
nice
maltyness
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
as
usual
sierra
nevada
makes
another
very
solid
offering
i
guess
this
one
needed
to
warm
a
little
to
really
unfold
and
feel
the
weight
of
it
by
the
end
of
the
glass
redoric
has
become
quite
a
big
beer
and
certainly
a
good
one
to
end
the
night
with
i
like
most
aspects
about
this
beer
but
there
is
just
something
that
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
in
its
finish
probably
just
personal
preference
otherwise
another
solid
beer
from
sierra
nevada
and
fun
to
try
their
take
on
an
imperial
red
roasted
and
dark
chocolate
leads
the
way
for
the
malt
side
even
balance
is
achieved
as
the
finish
is
dominated
by
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
and
texture
but
not
overwhelming
for
either
strong
basic
flavors
melded
nicely
maybe
not
as
refined
as
some
but
very
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
but
it
takes
a
lot
or
at
least
a
justright
combination
to
really
wow
me
with
an
imperial
red
maybe
if
the
hops
were
way
more
in
your
face
theyre
good
but
rather
subtle
or
the
malt
flavors
worked
differently
with
the
rest
i
like
the
bitterness
and
i
dont
detect
any
outright
off
flavors
whatsoever
its
a
good
value
just
not
something
id
be
inclined
to
buy
very
often
overall
pretty
solid
brew
its
not
outstanding
as
an
imperial
red
but
it
does
the
trick
a
little
underflavored
but
the
flavors
there
are
good
overall
definitely
a
fine
brew
from
sierra
nevada
with
big
time
malt
flavor
and
solid
hop
notes
any
fans
of
well
balanced
ales
would
enjoy
this
one
a
winner
imperial
red
ale
is
pretty
good
it
really
doesnt
make
any
huge
missteps
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
a
little
less
would
go
a
long
way
otherwise
it
performs
pretty
well
all
around
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
its
a
very
well
constructed
beer
i
just
dont
feel
that
drawn
to
it
but
could
easily
have
it
again
fruity
malt
sweetness
up
front
with
growing
herbal
almost
vegetal
hop
bitterness
malt
sweetness
dominates
the
palate
with
notes
of
pear
and
grapes
big
caramel
flavors
take
over
as
we
head
to
the
finish
providing
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
meanwhile
the
hop
bitterness
steadily
increases
with
notes
of
pepper
pine
and
a
little
citrus
lingering
caramel
and
fruit
in
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
maltier
than
expected
but
good
overall
a
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
again
a
solid
entry
in
this
beer
camp
that
any
amber
ale
fan
should
try
plenty
of
hop
but
still
malty
enough
to
be
a
red
maybe
mid
bodied
alcohol
is
hidden
clean
and
pretty
dry
a
good
american
red
ale
well
done
not
too
extream
per
usual
for
sn
this
is
a
damn
solid
red
ale
sturdy
chewy
malt
with
a
big
piney
hop
profile
bitterness
gets
more
serious
with
each
sip
which
in
my
book
is
a
great
sign
of
a
hoppy
ale
o
my
favorite
beer
camp
brew
so
far
every
sip
was
interesting
and
relatively
satisfying
not
a
lifechanging
beer
experience
but
it
was
definitely
a
memorable
drink
a
generously
hopped
red
could
be
considered
an
imperial
red
i
p
a
a
wellmade
brew
malty
but
with
a
considerable
hop
presence
this
was
a
decent
imperial
red
a
little
more
balanced
than
expected
but
still
a
very
high
quality
brew
with
some
complexity
present
the
8
1
abv
was
completely
undetectable
the
true
sign
of
a
well
crafted
offering
spruce
piny
aroma
soapy
head
and
lace
dots
on
cloudy
amber
initially
complex
hoppy
melange
with
a
dry
malty
finish
worth
sipping
to
enjoy
a
good
balance
between
hop
bitterness
and
sweetness
a
tad
of
chestnut
fruitiness
star
anise
a
must
try
a
really
nice
brew
hoppy
and
malty
at
the
same
time
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
overall
not
very
complex
on
the
malt
side
given
the
style
yet
showing
a
solid
hop
character
and
hiding
a
notable
abv
well
drinks
easily
as
a
result
and
ranking
very
low
on
the
cloying
meter
red
body
filtered
with
an
offwhite
head
mild
retention
and
lace
nose
is
fantastic
loads
of
dank
pot
pineapple
and
melon
character
tons
more
pot
on
the
palate
pine
melon
apricots
mango
lightly
herbal
and
some
sweeter
malt
character
medium
feel
bitter
with
just
a
light
sweetness
excellent
red
ale
with
a
ton
of
different
qualities
coming
through
on
every
sniffsip
definitely
recommended
carbonation
scale
of
2
out
of
5
not
very
heavy
again
considering
the
abv
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
and
the
bitterness
is
nice
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
is
is
pretty
average
for
a
big
red
ale
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
bottled
on
the
217th
of
12
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
that
leaves
globs
of
lace
smell
is
carmel
pine
toffee
and
grapefruit
taste
is
more
aggressive
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
sweet
grapefruit
lingers
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
large
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
more
lush
than
dry
and
excellent
drinkability
another
winner
in
this
awesome
mixed
12
pack
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
and
proper
example
of
an
imperial
red
ale
it
had
a
nice
and
bold
malt
backbone
that
helped
balance
out
the
loads
of
citrus
hops
that
imparted
lots
of
nice
fruity
flavors
that
worked
with
with
the
biscuity
caramel
malt
flavors
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
i
could
see
having
another
one
but
i
think
that
would
be
limit
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
how
good
it
looked
and
its
great
balance
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
and
the
balance
really
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
it
would
fit
this
beer
better
if
it
was
just
a
little
thicker
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
nice
imperial
red
ale
and
i
would
for
sure
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
all
in
all
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
and
it
delivered
just
about
everything
that
i
would
want
from
the
style
its
a
really
solid
beer
and
so
far
my
second
beer
from
the
beer
camp
series
so
far
i
am
liking
this
series
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
other
two
are
keep
up
the
good
work
sierra
nevada
series
like
this
are
what
puts
you
a
step
ahead
of
most
other
brewers
o
i
really
hope
they
make
this
a
year
round
or
seasonal
brew
i
really
dug
this
glad
i
have
few
more
to
drink
from
this
12pack
gotta
love
beer
camp
a
very
good
red
ale
that
is
another
fine
product
of
the
beer
camp
this
beer
hides
the
abv
well
but
after
a
second
i
felt
the
full
power
of
the
8
1
a
definite
recommendation
on
this
limited
release
as
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
m
light
body
quite
chewy
slightly
sticky
on
the
lips
o
best
brew
in
beer
camp
what
an
imperial
red
thats
full
of
flavor
o
pretty
good
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
my
only
knock
would
be
that
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
still
highly
drinkable
without
any
offensive
flavors
leaves
me
a
reasonably
happy
camper
overall
great
imperial
red
ale
while
not
reaching
the
apex
of
the
style
see
great
lakes
nosferatu
it
is
still
damn
good
and
much
better
than
the
average
on
the
site
suggests
this
is
a
nice
amber
with
a
combination
of
hops
and
malt
and
the
alcohol
well
hidden
well
done
sn
the
flavors
are
very
wellbalanced
with
nothing
being
overpowering
the
malt
brings
those
subdued
caramel
and
crusty
bread
qualities
and
there
are
some
floral
and
piney
hops
to
provide
balance
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
here
there
is
a
mild
aftertase
from
the
malt
and
hops
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
the
12
oz
bottle
from
the
12pack
i
have
only
seen
at
litickers
in
san
diego
o
its
a
pretty
good
standard
american
red
hop
forward
of
course
this
is
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
65
is
a
beautifully
constructed
ale
that
forgets
about
the
mundane
notions
of
balance
and
gains
inspiration
from
our
love
affair
with
ipas
to
inform
and
inspire
the
finish
product
from
its
recipe
formation
through
brewing
technique
and
fresh
delivery
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
worth
a
try
but
not
my
favorite
red
ale
or
favorite
imperial
red
slightly
imbalanced
and
too
dry
for
me
but
drinkable
nonetheless
serving
type
bottle
o
nice
beer
it
tastes
as
it
sounds
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
definitely
pick
up
the
multipack
if
you
can
o
so
far
my
favorite
out
of
the
beer
camp
mix
pack
the
most
flavorful
and
well
rounded
quite
well
done
extremely
hoppy
west
coast
nose
grapefruit
strong
pine
some
citrus
and
a
bit
of
soapiness
a
little
thinner
in
body
than
expected
sweet
dark
fruit
and
caramel
up
front
roll
over
the
tongue
into
the
balancing
hop
act
balance
is
actually
impeccable
strange
and
unique
layers
of
flavors
that
somehow
meld
together
into
on
interesting
sip
you
also
cant
detect
a
whiff
of
that
8
pretty
damn
good
but
im
a
sucker
for
imperial
reds
deep
red
colour
finger
of
off
white
head
with
some
lace
left
behind
smell
is
a
mix
of
citrus
and
malts
big
juicy
grapefruit
and
orange
sweet
malts
and
some
biscuity
caramel
taste
is
also
a
mix
of
malt
and
hops
moderately
sweet
citrus
fruit
mid
palate
grapefruit
and
earthy
hop
quite
bitter
throughout
with
a
long
malty
finish
lightmed
carbonation
oily
and
fairly
full
bodied
the
8
alcohol
goes
largely
undetected
nice
hoppy
red
ale
that
may
be
a
touch
too
sweet
still
a
smooth
drinking
beer
a
decent
beer
but
just
a
tad
off
in
all
areas
close
but
not
quite
there
o
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
it
is
just
below
the
standard
i
set
for
this
brewery
i
would
not
refuse
one
given
the
chance
although
i
certainly
would
not
lose
any
sleep
if
i
never
saw
this
beer
again
pours
a
brownish
burnt
copper
with
more
than
a
finger
of
head
the
head
lingered
a
bit
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
has
some
mild
citrus
notes
but
there
is
also
a
malt
presence
the
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
mixture
of
caramel
malt
and
hops
the
hops
are
not
overdone
but
they
are
certainly
featured
on
the
finish
considering
this
offering
clocks
in
at
slightly
above
8
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
among
the
solid
flavors
overall
impression
my
3rd
from
the
beer
camp
series
and
was
above
average
not
sure
why
the
hops
couldnt
have
came
up
sooner
in
the
taste
very
enjoyable
though
and
will
be
popping
another
one
of
these
glad
there
are
3
of
each
to
the
pack
o
i
think
they
got
this
right
light
on
the
hops
heavy
on
the
malt
rich
enough
with
just
enough
abv
to
warrant
the
imperial
label
edit
from
82012
just
learned
this
beer
will
be
part
of
the
beer
camp
sample
pack
from
sn
which
is
good
news
hopefully
that
means
we
will
continue
to
see
this
beer
on
tap
from
time
to
time
as
well
d
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
hoppy
imperial
red
ale
good
hop
profile
and
bitterness
throughout
i
expected
much
more
especially
considering
this
is
sierra
nevada
were
talking
about
it
should
satisfy
but
its
too
boring
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
the
hops
mixed
well
with
the
roasted
malts
reminiscent
of
dfhs
indian
brown
ale
but
with
a
little
more
sweetness
pours
rusty
with
a
quilt
of
peanut
foam
nice
tea
pine
and
bitter
citrus
notes
over
a
scotch
like
nose
there
is
a
certain
herbal
quality
to
this
beer
the
flavor
is
assertively
bitter
up
front
again
with
tea
like
hops
and
some
english
malts
then
followed
up
with
some
pleasant
creamy
sweetness
which
is
fleeting
and
then
some
lasting
esb
character
i
like
medium
on
full
bodied
with
prickly
moderately
hi
carb
and
an
offdry
finish
nice
beer
once
annually
would
be
nice
o
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
kind
of
on
the
forgettable
side
12oz
bottle
from
the
recent
mixed
beer
camp
12
pack
red
clear
sticky
head
smells
super
malty
i
always
expect
imperial
reds
to
be
super
hoppy
but
this
relied
more
on
malts
to
produce
a
solid
beer
smells
sort
of
like
coffee
yum
taste
has
the
slightest
hint
of
coffee
followed
by
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
this
might
be
the
best
beer
in
this
mix
pack
solid
o
a
good
imperial
red
but
nowhere
near
the
class
of
lagunitas
imperial
red
or
nugget
nector
odlooks
amazing
smells
amazing
but
it
tastes
good
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beers
overall
outcome
but
i
wish
the
flavor
lived
up
to
the
look
and
scent
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
suffers
for
lack
of
character
o
its
ok
probably
my
least
favorite
of
what
ive
had
out
of
this
seasons
beer
camp
so
far
the
8
0
abv
starts
to
show
up
as
it
warms
up
too
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
ive
had
much
better
versions
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
tealike
head
herbal
grassy
and
floral
hop
aromas
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
the
caramel
and
roasted
malt
flavor
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
would
let
on
the
grassy
and
floral
hop
mixes
with
a
slightly
bitter
alcohol
taste
to
ride
on
top
of
the
sweet
roasted
malt
flavors
mediumheavy
body
a
bit
of
syrupy
and
oil
low
carbonation
and
a
bitter
finish
another
good
beer
out
of
this
bunch
maybe
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
but
well
crafted

a
murky
dark
rust
color
with
a
half
iinch
of
head
lots
of
lacing
hoppy
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
tropical
fruits
some
malts
as
well
the
flavor
is
hoppy
grapefruit
not
as
tropical
as
the
aroma
but
more
of
a
citrus
hop
flavor
grapefruit
bitterness
at
the
end
slightly
boozey
decent
malt
backbone
creamy
mouthfeel
great
hoppy
red
ale
overall
great
beer
the
body
is
a
bit
heavy
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
mediocre
its
fair
enough
but
my
least
favorite
so
far
of
the
beer
camps
o
an
interesting
brew
reminds
me
of
a
founders
breakfast
stout
in
some
ways
except
the
emphasis
is
on
citrus
caramel
and
chocolate
definitely
worth
trying
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
lots
of
flavors
for
the
enjoyer
to
figure
out
and
keep
you
wondering
not
boring
by
any
means
sweet
bitter
roasty
with
enough
alcohol
warmth
what
a
great
brew
this
is
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
red
ale
its
solid
and
balanced
but
unfortunately
its
not
very
flavorful
its
malty
with
some
light
hoppiness
its
good
and
worth
trying
but
unfortunately
i
wont
have
this
again
o
reds
usually
arent
my
thing
but
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
overall
a
solid
brew
tasty
and
drinkable
i
wish
this
had
a
little
more
hoppiness
to
balance
this
one
out
better
though
nothing
fantastic
but
its
a
good
solid
impy
red
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
there
is
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
to
go
with
the
lively
carbonation
this
is
pretty
good
nothing
super
special
but
it
strikes
a
unique
balance
between
malt
and
hops
the
body
was
nice
full
and
the
beer
was
a
bit
sharp
across
the
tongue
mostly
from
the
hops
in
a
bit
of
a
dichotomy
the
had
a
sweet
but
still
dry
finish
drinkability
was
good
id
have
a
couple
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
overall
a
good
brew
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
sierra
nevadas
usual
hop
assault
might
make
a
nice
yearly
seasonal
release
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
overall
nice
change
of
pace
very
good
drinker
quite
the
change
of
pace
from
a
red
overall
this
isnt
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
harshness
of
the
bitter
flavors
was
too
much
i
dont
think
id
want
another
its
good
beer
my
nigga
inoffensive
enjoyable
beer
would
recommend
beautiful

present
if

like
that
you
will
love
this
either

i
am
surprised
how
such
big
company
can
produce
such
quality
beer
please
dont
change
this
recipe
very
flavorful
complex
pleasantly
hoppy
and
superbly
balanced
beer
bringing
together
two
styles
i
love
it
cannot
go
wrong
i
dont
understand
the
disparity
in
grades
though
the
most
recent
ones
seem
much
better

guess
average
people
like

pours
a
nice

light

relatively
quickly
but
lacing
remains
very
strong

very
earthy
like
cool
wet
soil
on
a
hot
summer
day
lighter
on
the
hoppiness
very
interesting
and
nice
the
taste
has
a
delicate
bitterness
and
hoppiness
up
front
but
fades
quickly
to
fruit
punch
on
the
finish
like
hawaiian
punch
really
cool
has
a
very
sophisticated
feel
for
what
i
consider
a
sessionable
beer
the
complexity
of
a
great
ipa
with
a
drinkability
that
is
all
its
own
overall
fantastic
and
well
worth
the
money
this
and

really
impressed

at

its
an
outstanding
beer
absolutely
love
the

the

are
very
good
i
love
the
intensity
that
torpedo
ipa
brings
but
i
also
like
that
this
one
is
not
quite
as
intense
and
gives
you
more
of
that
earthy
flavor
this
beer
is
very
very
good
and
i
will
look
forward
to
it
every
single
year
overall
a
pretty
decent
hoppy

in

definitely
get
more

summed
up
this

an
another

puts
out

this
is
gone
due
to
age
on
the
bottle
but
you
can
taste
the
quality
of
a
sn
ale
and
its
tasty
enough
once
again
i
finsd
a
decent
beer
on
the
downslide
and
am
left
to
wonder
how
it
would
have
tasted
clear
easy
to
read
large
letter
bds
cant
come
soon
enough
o
a
tasty
treat
i
would
recommend
and
would
definitely
have
another
again
a
pleasantly
balanced
ipa
normally
im
not
a
fan
of
red
beers
i
blame
killians
but
this
red
ipa
was
thoroughly
tasty
the
amount
of
hops
was
just
perfectly
bitter
and
there
was
a
nice
dryness
too
i
also
noticed
lovely
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
classy
red
ipa
great
aroma
and
a
great
taste
an
enjoyable

but
balanced
red
ipa
had
this
from
the
bottle
in
maui
typical
well
made
offering
from
snb
malty
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
awesome
stop
reading
this
and
go
get
one
the
fact
that
it
is
a
seasonal
beer
makes
it
bitter
sweet
this
beer
is
super
complex
and
thats
coming
from
a
man
who
mostly
drinks
russian
imperial
stouts
heavy
than
average
buzz
for

i
missed
out
on
this
in
its
first
year
of
existence

wanted
to
make
sure
i
grabbed
it
this
year
i

out
but
nothing
i
would
turn
my
nose
up
at
if
presented
the
opportunity
in
the
future
i
popped
the
cap
and
gave
it
a

watch

into

srm
17
overall
another
quality
product
by
sierra
nevada
which
as
usual
didnt
fall
to
impress
i
would
recommend
this
red
ale
without
any
hesitation
malty
and
slight
spice
up
front
followed
by
slight
citrus
taste
which
turns
piney
afterwards
refreshing
for
end
of
summer
in
florida
where
it
doesnt
feel
like
fall
but
you
want
it
to
not
as
hoppy
as
torpedo
more
like
red
pale
ale
went
well
with
brisket
nice
amber
ale
not
overly
hoppy
or
fruity
but
just
enough
to
know
you
are
enjoying
a
red
ipa
perfect
for
a
crisp
cool
fall
evening
pours
a
nice
reddish
hue
with
a
lasting
off
white
head
good
lacing
aroma
and
taste
is
floral
hops
upfront
slowly
mellowing
to
a
flavorful
citrus
and
orange
peel
flavor
with
some
caramel
malt
notes
a
smooth
drinking
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
finishes
with
some
nice
caramel
malt
and
citrus
orange
peel
flavor
balanced
by
some
good
floral
herbal
hops
for
balance
a
well
made
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
brew
good
stuff
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
very
nice
amber
red
with
an
off
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
hops
giving
it
a
floral
aroma
but
with
a
lot
of
subtleties
i
cant
quite
place
the
taste
was
great
with
all
spice
at
the
beginning
turning
more
to
the
hops
in
the
middle
with
a
nice
toasty
finish
i
found
this
one
very
enjoyable
would
definitely
recommend
this
is
what
i
would
like
amber
ales
to
taste
like
theres
a
solid
hop
profile
that
goes
along
with
biscuit
and
tea
flavors
if
any
brewery
was
going
to
pull
this
off
it
was
likely
to
be
this
one
i
typically
prefer
brighter
ipas
but
this
remains
very
drinkable
id
happily
get
this
again
love
the
red
ipas
and
this
one
is
good
a
hint
of
the
red
malt
but
pretty
pale
very
refreshing
a
decent
enough
ale
very
earthy
and
dirty
tasting
the
bitterness
is
lingering
very
well
balanced
not
too
citrusy
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
still
a
good
hoppy
flavor
as
with
most
sierra
nevada
beers
overall
a
decent
beer
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
too
many
great
ipas
out
there
inc
several
from
sn
to
buy
this
one
again
sierra
nevada
bills
this
as
the
antidote
for
long
hot
summers
spent
drinking
light
sessionable
ales
they
got
that
right
i
found
my
six
pack
in
midseptember
the
very
nick
of
time
it
may
not
be
exactly
sessionable
but
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
tasty
brew
again
the
pourr
looks
promising
first
taste
has
pale
ale
notes
then
it
goes
downhill
flat
metallic
dry
finishes
sour
and
leaves
you
wishing
you
had
15
99
back
wasnt
for
me
an
interesting
combination
this
darker
ipa
is
a
great
transition
out
of
summer
definitely
a
different
breed
than
your
usual
flowery
piney
ipa
with
complex
amber
and
fruity
flavor
not
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
a
good
amber
ipa
which
helps
transition
into
the
autumn
season

the
opinions
in
this
review
are
mine
and
mine
alone
imo
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
any
sierra
nevada
brew
with
the
end
of
summerbeginning
of
fall
wanted
to
try
this
new
red
ipa
from
sn

a
very
dark

with
a
nice
1
12
inch
foamy
billowy
head
beautiful
hoppy
smell
a
little
bit
piney
and
a
little
bit
fruity
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
very
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
floral
really
solid
at
6
2
and
a
very
high
drinkability
be
careful
with
this
one
packaged
on

poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
packaged

into
my
tulip
deep
reddish

looked
kind
of
transluscent
little
bit
of
head
grassy
centennial
hops
broke
through
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
citrus
the
ubiquitous
sn
fresh
smell
and
a
bit
of
a
bitter
note
refreshingly
bitter
to
taste
maybe
a
bit
too
bitter
covered
up
the
nice
malt
character
some
typical
lightmedium
sn
body
to
the
ipa
style
however
crisp
with
a
nice
finish
as
much
as
i
like
sn
this
seemed
a
typical
sn
beer
quite
good
but
would
probably
choose
something
more
adventurous
next
time
pours
dark
amberred
color
with
half
finger
width
foamy

head
retention

minimal
has
an

first
taste
more
grassy
than
anything
else
smoother
malty
citrus
taste
follows
with
a
nice

aftertaste
good
beer
leaves
that
nice
bitter
aftertaste
i
like
with
ipas
there
is
a
little
something
off
in
the
transition
of
malts
and
hops
in
this
beer
a
solid
red
as
the
description
states
it
does
indeed
seem
perfect
for
those
two
weeks
or
so
in
between
the
last
gasps
of
summer
and
the
first
crisps
of
fall
gorgeous
thick
head
deep
amberyred
color
bright
pine
scent
not
too
malty
leads
a
complex
hoppy
then
malty
then
back
and
forth
in
that
manner
hadnt
seen
this
before
but
glad
i
tried
it
overall
a
solid
beer
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
sn
o
pretty
good
seasonal
red
balanced
well
probably
would
buy
again
overall
im
a
huge
fan
of
red
ipas
and
sierra
nevada
hit
this
one
on
the
head
solid
malty
red
ipa
thats
great
for
these
chilly
summer
nights
as
we
transition
into
fall
great
job
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
bitter
the
overall
impression
is
a
hoppy
brew
with
lots
of
malt
to
balance
things
i
thought
it
was
a
lot
higher
alcohol
content
than
it
is
it
seemed
heavier
recommended
taste
is
hop
forward
but
has
a
nice
evenkeeled
malt
foundation
that
makes
the
beer
so
tasty
it
is
not
toasty
or
toffee
or
even
caramel
a
little
bit
of
all
three
would
be
as
best
i
can
describe
the
hops
shine
with
plenty
of
both
flavoring
citrus
and
bittering
mouthfeel
is
great
perfect
carbonation
and
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
ill
buy
more
of
this
for
sure
the
body
shows
of
a
clean
nature
while
running
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
the
focus
is
crispness
though
it
is
quite
smooth
it
almost
has
a
lagerlike
feel
to
it
actually
as
well
as
having
a
leafy
mildly
dry
element
and
almost
a
somewhat
mineral
feel
to
it
that
adds
a
bit
of
english
so
to
speak
in
my
mind
blends
both
qualities
of
an
amber
and
an
ipa
very
well
features
the
great
toasted
malt
features
as
well
as
a
nice
grapefruit
hop
punch
and
resinous
bitterness
that
works
well
with
the
biscuit
malt
backbone
crisp
perfect
brew
for
the
transition
to
fall
cheers
o
umm
its
okay
its
got
decent
balance
its
got
a
nice
drinkability
clean
its
just
there
overall
a
real
good
ipa
i
would
drink
this
again
and
often
overall
this
is
an
extremely
well
executed
complex
beer
which
essentially
equates
to
a
very
hoppy
amber
ale
sierra
nevada
definitely
flexes
their
brewing
prowess
with
this
one
the
hop
and
malt
bill
truly
jive
seamlessly
and
deliciously
overall
interesting
amber
or
red
ipa
or
whatever
not
great
but
decent
enough
great
red
ipa
not
too
fruity
beautiful
color
overall
its
a
good
quality
red
ipa
what
id
expect
out
of
sn
and
what
i
got
taste
is
spot
on
hoppy
fall
perhaps
but
if
it
tastes
this
good
i
will
take
it
exactly
as
advertised
a
hoppy
amber
nice
earthy
brown
sugar
with
a
good
dose
of
hop
easy
drinking
and
yummy
overall
not
a
bad
beer
one
id
be
ok
with
ordering
if
there
was
nothing
good
on
tap
but
not
one
im
dying
to
try
again

with

too
much
caramel

for
my
taste
with
the
citra
hops
not
coming
out
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
good
beer
kind
of
has
a
rye
flavor
on
top
of
the
hops
not
a
bad
price
either
coats
about
13
for
a
12
pack
sierra
nevada
always
puts
out
a
quality
brew
and
this
one
is
no
exception
pours
a
beautiful
red
hue
smells
of
grapefruit
and
pine
needles
to
me
really
tasty
beer
but
would
be
hard
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
a
night
overall
a
satisfying
brew
overall
well
made
maybe
not
the
most
flavorful
though
an
excellent
seasonal
by
sierra
nevada
i
recommend
it
if
youre
leaning
toward
a
toastier
taste
when
entering
the
fall
season
o
personally
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
sierra
nevada
offering
i
think
that
i
prefer
it
to
the
torpedo
rye
ipa
and
the
celebration
those
are
all
awesome
beers
but
for
me
this
one
has
a
bit
more
complexity
than
the
others
and
it
accomplishes
this
without
muddling
any
one
attribute
really
solid
and
i
hope
that
it
becomes
a
regular
offering
at
the
end
of
the
summer
it
certainly
deserves
to
be
4
11
overall
i
personally
enjoy
this
more
than
i
did
last
year
when
first
released
theres
a
nice
complexity
between
the
citrusforward
hops
and
the
darker
malts
i
feel
the
hop
flavors
are
masked
somewhat
by
the
malts
used
compared
to
sierra
nevadas
other
ipas
this
leads
to
the
hops
giving
almost
a
spicy
note
throughout
pours
a
nice
amber
color
nice
carbonation
dry
bitterness
in
this
one
the
darker
malt
is
just
enough
to
make
this
drinkable
no
sweetness
of
note
this
stuff
is
very
good
red
ipa
so
a
little
of
that
spice
action
and
lots
of
fruity
hops
good
full
mouth
feel
balanced
smooth
and
crisp
yea
theyve
done
it
again
folks
in
fact
i
think
i
prefer
this
over
torpedo
at
this
very
moment
celebration
is
still
number
one
though
this
is
the
best
sn
ive
tried
since
ruthless
rye
definitely
solid
and
a
nice
departure
from
sn
pale
ale
and
torpedo
but
part
of
me
felt
wanting
one
of
the
former
two
good
but
lighter
than
i
had
hoped
for
nice
twist
on
ipa
with
assertive
malt
flavor
in
some
ways
more
like
a
big
american
brown
ale
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
i
drank
about
half
and
then
drain
poured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
luckily
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
out
of
a
mixasix
without
getting
all
technical
about
mouth
feel
and
earthy
roots
with
a
hint
of
etc
etc
i
have
to
say
that
for
what
it
is
i
really
like
this
beer
sierra
nevada
beers
generally
kick
ass
excellent
beer
i
feel
like
i
walked
into
a
micro
brew
and
got
an
amber
on
draft
nice
early
flavor
bitter
and
a
relatively
clean
finish
this
is
a
winner
another
solid
ipa
from

a

another
good
one
from

call
it
a
hoppedup
amber
or
red
ipa
but
either
way
its
enjoyable
o
very
unique
beer
we
have
here
it
is
an
ipa
no
questions
asked
but
it
is
a
different
breed
of
ipa
not
quite
as
roasty
and
malty
as
a
black
ipa
nor
not
as
citrusy
and
bitter
as
a
iipa
or
even
an
ipa
for
that
matter
sierra
nevada
continues
to
truly
brew
staples
of
each
different
beer
style
a
red
ipa
is
meant
to
blend
together
and
blur
the
lines
of
ipas
and
other
styles
this
particular
brew
does
just
that
there
are
a
handful
of
breweries
that
just
cant
miss
sierra
nevada
is
among
them
to
infinity
and
beyond
o
not
a
bad
beer
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
from
the
flavor
cheers
i
will
be
buying
this
again
fantastic
seasonal
beer
from
sierra

has
a
nice
pinecitrus
smell
to
it
that
is
really
nice
when
first
opened
and
then
fades
away
dark

color
is
exactly
what
you
would
hope
it
looks
like
the
taste
is
that
of
a
nottoohoppy

with
a
lovely
nut
type
flavor
to
go
along
with
it

foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
zest
light
pine
sap
caramel
mild

and
a
touch

the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
caramel
and
maple
boldly
defending
against
the
massive
onslaught
of
pine
and
citrus
though
entirely
in
vain
yeah
this
means
theres
a
bit
of
clash
to
the
flavors
but
its
not
all
that
strident
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
red

nuff
said
really
i
poured
this
beer
into

has
a
reddish

the
aroma
has
a
pine

the
taste

taste
i
also
get
a
little
malt
on
the
back
tongue
the
m
outhfeel
is

leaves
a
nice

overall
uhh

a
darn
good
red

o
this
is
a
deliciously
tropical
and
nectary
red

i
think
thats
the
idea
behind

super
hoppy

drinking
flip
side
anytime
it
goes
well
with
average
foods
or
alone
comes
to
the
table
a
crystal
clear
medium
reddish
brown
with
a
fair
off
white
head
aromas
of
bready
malt
hints
of
spice
and
lots
of
citrus
and
pine
flavor
follows
the
aroma
a
bit
skewed
to
the
malt
side
but
flavorful
enough
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
sweet
mouthfeel
nice
easy
drinking
flavorful
ale

overall
nothing
bold
or
in
your
face
about
this
one
just
a
decent
well
rounded
american
amber
something
that
will
appeal
to
most
beer
drinkers
i
suppose
i
poured
this
from
a
bottle
into
an
ale
glass
the
color
is
great
with
a
nice
head
which
makes
for
great
lacing
it
appears
as
a
deep
redbrown
kind
of
reminds
me
of
changing
leaves
which
makes
it
really
nice
for
the
time
of
year
there
is
a
nice
scent
o
this
beer
you
get
some
floral
hops
and
even
am
i
nuts
maybe
some
spiced
apple
it
smells
awesome
the
mouthfeel
is
just
perfect
and
very
unique
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
it
works
well
here
and
i
think
they
were
going
for
something
that
had
a
bubbly
feel
as
it
keeps
this
ipa
initially
light
on
the
palate
the
taste
how
did
they
do
this
starts
off
with
light
hops
different
for
an
ipa
then
yes
i
got
some
spiced
apple
and
even
some
cinnamon
finishing
with
more
hops
but
not
of
citrus
more
like
light
pine
which
works
so
well
with
the
other
flavors
this
is
one
of
the
strangest
ipas
i
have
ever
had
and
its
great
would
even
be
great
for
later
in
the
season
and
i
believe
anyone
who
enjoys
quality
crafted
ipas
will
be
very
very
surprised
at
this
one
entirely
unique
a
lovely
and
delicious
beer
and
one
i
will
have
no
problem
with
buying
again
next
year
overall
solid
and
well
made
as
advertised
o
im
personally
glad
they
swapped
out
tumbler
for
this
but
im
not
especially
in
the
mood
for
hoppy
beers
this
time
of
year
nevertheless
this
is
a
good
beer
that
lives
up
more
to
the
red
ipa
on
its
label
than
the
typical
amber
ale
style
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
all
that
good
and
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beers
its
not
something
i
would
buy
again
o
perhaps
just
a
touch
sweet
but
very
tasty
o
i
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
works
well
with
both
lighter
and
heavier
meals
nothing
about
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
jump
for
joy
however
it
would
be
a
safe
choice
if
walking
into
an
unfamiliar
bar
but
who
on
this
forum
would
be
afraid
of
ten
taps
they
didnt
recognize
this
isnt
as
exciting
as
the
description
or
as
endearing
as
the
label
art
but
its
worth
drinking
nothing
particularly
exciting
here
but
nothing
bad
and
i
approve
overall
a
tasty
and
complex
red
ale
o
nice
easy
drinking
beer
not
sierra
nevadas
best
but
still
pretty
good
didnt
really
love
tumbler
but
not
sure
this
is
that
much
better
keeping
in
mind
that
this
is
a
red
first
though
even
if
a
red
ipa
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
red
i
thought
i
hated
reds
too
much
leines
red
in
college
but
have
been
converted
by
fixed
gear
and
the
like
and
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
red
done
with
some
gusto
would
buy
again
overall
an
excellent
beer
overall
not
quite
an
ipa
not
quite
an
amber
but
a
nice
combination
o
i
like
the
idea
of
pairing
this
with
a
caramel
dessert
as
suggested
on
the
sn
website
and
did
to
great
effect
with
my
wifes
caramelchocolatecookie
concoction
i
enjoy
the
balance
of
the
beer
good
early
fall
beer
as
marketed
procured
as
a
party
leftover
id
pay
to
drink
it
again
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
of
typical
for
the
style
and
had
a
bitter
finish
that
lingered
a
bit
too
long
for
my
enjoyment
drinkability
was
ok
i
probably
wouldnt
have
2
in
a
row
but
id
have
it
again
overall
a
nicely
pleasant
brew
thats
probably
worth
a
shot
when
you
see
it
a
nice
rather
easy
drinking
amber
ale
but
it
falters
with
compared
with
a
slightly
bigger
ale
along
similar
lines
such
as
hop
head
red
light
and
refreshing
start
with
a
hoppy
finish
on
the
drink
not
over
powering
at
all
the
sweetcitrus
fruit
notes
are
there
but
subtle
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
mind
blowing
i
still
buy
tumbler
but
im
not
sure
ill
say
the
same
about
this
one
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
leaves
this
very
drinkable
bitterness
is
not
overly
assertive
looks
great
in
the
glass
smells
really
good
tastes
pretty
nice
and
feels
alright
overall
flipside
is
one
of
the
more
average
offerings
from
sierra
nevada
though
sierra
nevadas
average
is
better
than
many
breweries
best
overall
not
bad
but
personally
i
expect
more
from
sn
bring
on
the
celebration
ale
and
big
foot
overall
not
bad
nice
malt
character
decent
hop
profile
and
good
balance
i
like
the
way
the
caramel
creams
and
candy
malt
flavours
mix
with
the
spicy
slight
pine
hops
and
the
strange
but
interesting
dark
fruit
like
characters
pretty
tasty
but
nothing
too
special
as
there
isnt
much
you
can
do
more

the

is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
smooth

this
is
an

right
beer
but
kind
of
a
let
down
expected
more
this
is
excellent
lots
of

is
so
inviting

oh
how
i
wish
ambers
and
red
ales
tasted
like
this
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
overall
its
red
its
bitter
i
was
fine
with
it
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
decent
that
has
some
strange
stuff
going
on
as
you
inspect
further
between
carbonic
quality
and
soft
vegetative
to
fruity
aspects
this
one
is
otherwise
quite
enjoyable
bottoms
up
lots
of
fresh
hop
flavours
mucking
about
here
thats
for
sure
but
they
arent
allowed
to
totally
run
the
table
as
the
malt
backbone
seems
less
than
keen
to
take
their
guff
what
we
get
out
this
is
a
zingy
earthy
and
enjoyable

clone
in

rjt
solid
beer
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
sierra
nevada
considering
how
great
their
other
hoppy
beers
are
good
stuff
overall
an
easy
drinker
particularly
for
this
particular
season
id
pick
this
over
tumbler
any
day
another
hit
from
sierra
nevada
o
a
hopped
up
amber
that
has
superb
drinkability
and
balance
i
could
get
used
to
this
staying
in
their
rotation
beer
looks
great
on
the
pour
massive
creme
head
with
a
significant
degree
of
lacing
flavor
profile
is
good
kind
of
what
i
expect
to
get
from
sierra
nevada
seems
to
fall
off
a
bit
quickly
though
i
wouldnt
mind
a
more
lasting
flavor
but
what
is
there
is
nice
and
hearty
with
a
slight
sweet
tang
that
seems
almost
fruit
like
o
flipside
starts
like
a
redhued
ipa
in
the
aroma
losing
itself
somewhere
in
flavor
where
its
focused
and
direct
aromas
become
muddled
but
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
are
a
lot
more
akin
to
sierra
nevadas
style
bitter
but
controlled
and
drinkable
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick

pleasant

of

pretty

overall
not
bad
overall
a
really
good
beer
from

but
i
dont
necessarily
like
it
as
a
fall

i
reallly
miss
tumbler
overall
a
pretty
solid

on
a

with

light
medium

prominent

without

finishes
with
a
great

flavor
rather
than
a
kick
in
your
teeth
bitterness
such
as
sn
torpedo
this
is
one
of
sns
best
beers
it
is
well
balanced
with
malt
and
hop
flavor
a
very
nice
citrus
pine
flavor
at
the
finish
that
lingers
as
slightly
bitter
grapefruit
o
a
good
hoppy
red
ale
a
fine
beer
really
but
where
does
it
fit
into
their
seasonal
rotation
overlapping
this
with
tumbler
doesnt
seem
like
a
smart
idea
overall
no
remorse
here
flipside
is
a
great
beer
this
is
no
surprise
considering
where
it
came
from
id
drink
this
any
day
yo
me
gusta
flipside
red
ipa
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
smell
is
a
nice
bouquet
of
fresh
hops
that
carries
subtle
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
is
a
well
balanced
fight
between
subtle
malt
and
fresh
hops
which
provides
a
very
nice
sessionable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in

with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
its
an
excellent
beer
and
the
hops
really
come
through
so
well
i
like
this
better
than
their
torpedo
because
of
the
sweet
malt
taste
which
really
wraps
this
beer
up
nicely
sierra
nevada
was
smart
to
go
with
this
one
instead
of
their
last
fall
offering
reddishcopper
color
the
nose
is
quite
hoppy
plenty
of
bitterness
but
the
balance
just
is
not
quite
there
for
me
do
this
seasonal
replacement
for
tumbler
brown
ale
is
a
return
to
true
sierra
nevada
form
it
moves
their
annual
lineup
even
closer
to
presenting
an
uninterrupted
continuum
of
sensory
qualitiesthis
one
seems
to
fit
somewhere
between
pale
ale
and
celebration
ipa
it
appears
to
be
a
wellexecuted
middleroad
recipe
that
lacks
much
of
a
dryhopped
character
one
might
hope
for
in
a
new
ipa
recipe
debuted
in
2013
o
didnt
get
either
tropical
fruit
or
citrus
but
this
is
an
interesting
beer
all
the
same
overall
a
solid
red
ipa
ill
have
to
do
a
vertical
tasting
of
this
and
nugget
nectar
sometime
o
i
usually
enjoy
sn
products
but
i
think
this
one
is
a
little
off
the
mark
in
almost
every
area
whats
odd
is
that
they
have
created
much
better
red
ipas
as
part
of
their
beer
camp
series
wonder
why
this
one
got
the
nod
not
a
repeat
buy
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
well
a
very
interesting
beer
will
enjoy
this
6er
that
is
for
sure
i
will
say
that
upon
first
sip
it
does
have
that
hey
its
a
sn
hoppy
beer
aroma
and
taste
flavor
but
when
something
works
why
change
it
oi
have
mix
thoughts
about
this
beer
on
one
hand
being
a
hop
lover
i
enjoyed
this
beer
pretty
well
on
the
other
hand
this
is
a
beer
strickly
for
hop
heads
i
think
this
one
would
not
be
recommened
for
the
average
newby
craft
beer
lover
the
bitterness
level
kind
of
almost
over
takes
everything
but
for
a
hop
head
like
myself
i
would
recommend
them
trying
it

sure

true

a
solid

at

solid
red

a
pretty

not
nearly
hoppy
enough
to
be
a

the
bitterness
is
definitely
there
and
may
actually
be
a
little
too
much
for
the
lack

this
beer
sierra

makes
my

while
this
is
still
an

it
is

o

a

up
the

sierra

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
above
average
example
of
the
style
the
hops
didnt
do
the
greatest
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
thought
the
malt
profile
was
really
nice
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
and
the
flavor
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
malt
base
i
thought
it
was
very
well
done
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
hop
profile
it
wasnt
bad
but
its
very
typical
for
sierra
nevada
and
it
can
be
found
in
almost
all
of
their
other
hoppy
bees
i
might
order
this
at
a
bar
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
any
to
keep
at
home
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
that
like
pretty
hoppy
red
ales
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
wish
sierra
nevada
would
try
something
different
when
it
comes
to
hopping
their
beers
this
was
a
solid
effort
but
i
prefer
tumbler
over
this
beer
and
im
sad
to
see
it
go
i
just
dont
think
flipsise
is
on
the
same
level
especially
for
the
season
overall
a
pretty
good
selection
though
not
in
sierra
nevadas
top
5
it
is
marketed
as
a
red
ipa
however
it
resembles
an
amber
ale
very
well
balanced
with
more
aroma
hops
than
bittering
overall
this
is
another
solid
ipa
from
sierra
nevada
o
mixed
feeling
of
this
red
ipa
i
would
expect
more
hop
flavor
upfront
i
know
traditionally
a
red
ale
will
lack
late
addition
flavoring
hops
but
if
you
slap
the
word
ipa
on
it
i
expect
it
it
does
have
some
but
just
not
what
i
was
thinking
beyond
that
it
tastes
great
the
bittering
is
huge
and
refreshing
moutfeel
is
good
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
taste
slightly
lingers
a
few
seconds
great
carbonation
level
well
balanced
overall
steady
sweet
start
with
a
clean
bitter
finis
thats
slightly
dry
this
beer
is
a
perfect
transition
from
summer
to
fall
beer
great
in
between
beer
i
like
the
red
ipa
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
slight
step
back
to
the
sam
adams
version
but
its
still
a
great
beer
drinkability
factor
is
crazy
i
actually
had
to
crack
a
second
one
during
this
review
because
i
drank
the
first
one
faster
than
expected
price

makes
this
a
steal
once
again
sierra
nevada
puts
out
a
very
solid
beer
that
has
wide
distribution
magical
highly
recommended
check
it
out
easy
to
find
and
cheap
and
a
good
counterpoint
to
so
many
generally
bitter
ipas
around
goes
for
and
finds
a
distinct
flavor
a
very
well
done
amber
ale
big
hop
notes
blend
very
well
with
the
different
malts
used
something
i
could
certainly
enjoy
a
6pack
of
ruby
red
in
color
with
an
orange
hue
and
a
slight
chill
haze
poured
with
a
short
off
white
foam
that
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
that
left
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
slightly
pungent
hop
aromas
up
front
with
ripe
orange
and
pineapple
pine
hop
aromas
sugary
sweet
caramel
malt
and
spicy
hop
aromas
from
the
middle
to
the
end
medium
bodied
with
an
initially
thin
feel
until
the
rich
tangy
carbonation
rolls
through
caramel
malt
flavor
down
the
middle
with
pine
hops
on
the
edges
pine
hops
transition
to
mellow
rule
citrus
flavors
through
the
middle
with
sugary
sweet
notes
in
tow
finishes
with
ripe
citrus
fruit
sweetness
and
delicate
lingering
pine
hop
bitterness
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
complex
flavors
and
aromas
of
this
one
o
something
a
little
different
than
what
im
used
to
and
i
love
it
very
smooth
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
little
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
in
months
and
id
say
the
best
seasonal
beer
ive
had
bought
one
in
a
mixed
packs
and
plan
on
buying
a
couple
of
six
packs
of
just
this
really
really
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
get
it
o
good
maltiness
paired
with
earthy
hops
appropriate
for
the
fall
season
an
above
average
red
ipa
but
not
quite
a
fridge
staple
o
nice
ipa
o
apparently
i
liked
this
one
much
better
than
most
on
here
while
this
does
not
a
the
level
of
nugget
nectar
i
personally
find
it
much
more
drinkable
excellent
this
was
disappointing
for
me
its
a
fine
beer
and
all
but
for
sierra
nevada
i
really
expect
much
more
the
taste
of
this
is
very
simple
mostly
citrusy
hops
with
a
very
subdued
malt
presence
this
just
isnt
dynamic
or
anything
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
good
either
the
bare
minimum
of
what
i
expect
from
an
ipa
i
was
really
sad
when
i
tried
this
because
i
was
expecting
something
amazing
like
sierra
nevadas
celebration
ale
try
it
out
you
might
like
it
more
than
i
do
the
aroma
is
standard
ipaish
as
i
get
citrusy
hops
for
the
most
part
and
bits
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
breadiness
taste
is
the
same
mostly
citric
hops
with
a
touch
of
spice
little
bit
of
breadiness
makes
for
fuller
mouthfeel
and
then
sweetness
adds
balanced
overall
about
a
mediumbodied
ipa
that
has
a
crisp
finish
a
good
ipa
that
for
lack
of
explanation
i
just
found
a
bit
offunderwhelming
so
not
one
of
my
top
picks
apperance
is
a
deep
auburn
with
a
brownish
tint
generous
head
upon
pour
about
2
12
fingers
as
it
recedes
it
leaves
a
heavy
layer
of
lace
the
aroma
starts
with
piney
hops
very
aromatic
but
sadly
not
getting
too
much
of
the
citra
influence
in
the
nose
the
pine
hop
notes
are
followed
by
a
strong
malt
profile
which
presents
some
caramel
and
bread
taste
is
hop
forward
with
floral
notes
along
with
some
citrus
and
pine
the
malt
backbone
comes
through
next
and
features
some
toasted
notes
moderate
bitterness
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
body
overall
a
nice
ipa
from
sierra
nevada
in
the
vein
of
their
other
ipa
hop
profiles
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
fact
that
the
taste
didnt
match
the
juiciness
i
expected
from
the
description
either
way
tasty
brew
and
great
value
2
75
overall
update
much
higher
for
appearance
huge
off
white
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
flipside
red
ipa
is
a
very
good
product
overall
and
while
i
dont
rank
it
among
my
sierra
nevada
top
5
it
is
still
much
better
than
the
average
beer
and
a
product
i
recommend
pours
a
deep
a
reddish
brown
with
a
frumpy
tan
head
with
excellent
retention
aromas
are
very
hoppy
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
grapefruit
notes
and
malty
aromas
reminiscent
of
caramel
and
cocoa
the
bitter
notes
dominate
the
front
palate
before
a
toffee
like
sweetness
enter
the
middle
finishes
with
a
taste
of
chocolate
covered
orange
peel
very
very
tasty
medium
full
body
is
very
satisfying
i
like
this
a
lot
and
intend
to
buy
more
o
would
have
liked
more
malt
sweetness
for
balance
hop
presence
is
powerful
o
bored
to
tears
with
this
one
there
is
a
pattern
to
all
of
the
sierra
nevada
beers
dank
and
bitter
pine
and
bready
malt
this
one
included
this
is
just
like
a
cross
between
ruthless
rye
and
tumbler
to
me
this
beer
shouldve
been
a
heck
of
a
lot
maltier
for
a
red
ale
or
red
ipa
the
best
part
of
the
beer
was
the
impeccable
pour
other
than
that
drink
a
green
flash
hop
head
red
or
a
troegs
nugget
nectar
for
a
real
red
ipa
experience
othe
finish
was
the
worst
part
the
nose
was
misleading
just
left
wishing
for
more
there
is
a
reason
why
my
blood
is
red
because
this
stuff
is
coursing
through
my
veins
big
fan
big
big
fan
not
one
to
usually
care
much
about
the
appearance
of
the
beer
but
this
one
is
a
nice
red
color
and
the
color
indicates
a
complexity
of
malt
compounds
present
which
contribute
nicely
to
the
important
attribute
the
flavor
oh
the
flavor
this
beer
grew
out
of
the
earth
just
like
i
did
and
the
taste
is
there
to
prove
it
there
is
grain
in
this
bottle
and
it
feeds
and
sustains
you
there
are
hops
in
this
bottle
they
awaken
your
face
and
mind
there
is
yeast
in
this
bottle
and
now
its
inside
you
alive
and
teeming
you
are
no
longer
a
purely
humanneanderthal
mixture
now
you
are
part
yeast
its
dna
is
now
in
your
dna
in
the
nucleus
of
every
cell
in
your
body
the
verdict
very
good
a
tasty
seasonal
ipa
with
a
sweet
malt
backbone
to
balance
out
the
quality
hops
did
i
mention
balanced
earthy
sweet
hoppy
and
malty
there
isnt
much
missing
from
this
one
omy
scores
reflect
what
i
think
ipa
lovers
like
and
this
is
very
much
an
ipa
which
is
my
least
favorite
style
any
characteristics
of
a
red
or
amber
ale
were
lost
it
was
tolerable
to
me
which
means
ipa
lovers
should
at
least
like
this
beer
if
not
love
it
but
it
didnt
really
stand
out
as
being
any
different
than
any
of
the
million
other
ipas
in
the
market
final
thoughts
at
about
a
month
and
a
half
old
flipside
red
ipa
is
tasting
great
and
i
might
just
invest
in
a
sixer
before
the
seasons
over
i
can
see
this
style
becoming
much
more
popular
in
the
near
future
the
casual
complexity
makes
for
a
great
drinking
experience
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
light
oily
hop
texture
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
its
not
quite
an
ipa
but
close
enough
nice
to
have
something
different
that
is
still
tasty
onot
impressed
more
of
a
red
ale
than
a
red
ipa
and
just
an
okay
red
ale
at
that
thankfully
the
alcohol
wasnt
that
pronounced
and
fit
in
well
with
this
style
of
beer
had
this
been
a
bit
more
aggressive
and
red
this
could
have
really
been
an
outstanding
beer
as
is
this
was
a
nice
alternative
to
the
seasonals
that
are
currently
available
but
just
a
bit
of
a
letdown
fine
for
an
afternoon
with
some
pigskin
on
the
tube
but
given
a
choice
id
probably
take
the
tumbler
over
this
overall
not
as
good
as
the
wet
hop
series
but
on
par
with
the
torpedo
ipa
not
sure
if
i
would
get
it
again
though
another
solid
offering
from
sierra
nevada
but
not
very
distinctive
i
prefer
the
tumbler
over
this
one
i
would
consider
this
more
of
a
hoppy
amber
style
than
an
ipa
but
styles
are
open
to
some
interpretation
overall
this
is
worth
trying
o
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
redamber
in
my
opinion
but
i
am
totally
ok
with
that
as
it
matched
very
well
with
my
bacon
cheese
burger
overall
good
solid
amberred
the
hopping
will
attract
hop
heads
and
the
malt
body
caters
to
fans
of
the
amberred
style
would
definitely
recommend
sierra
nevada
might
not
always
impress
craft
beer
enthusiasts
but
i
would
argue
that
they
are
a
solid
all
around
brewery
and
the
price
is
always
right
the
hop
flavor
is
in
perfect
contrast
rising
crisp
and
sharp
with
dry
grass
grapefruit
and
carmel
i
love
this
beer
it
has
a
great
red
hue
a
very
fragrant
smell
nice
and
hoppy
and
is
quite
good
i
am
a
big
fan
of
ipas
in
general
and
like
a
good
bitter
beer
the
one
thing
i
dont
always
like
about
some
ipas
is
that
after
i
finish
it
i
feel
like
i
could
use
a
glass
of
water
this
one
has
the
great
flavor
smell
and
a
terrific
finish
flipside
offers
a
wonderful
combination
of
hops
but
lacks
some
of
the
malt
depth
i
would
prefer
to
move
this
to
the
next
level
that
said
i
would
enjoy
having
this
beer
on
hand
d
a
very
nice
red
ipa
with
loads
of
hop
character
and
solid
biscuit
malt
base
to
balance
really
good
as
to
be
expected
from
sierra
nevada
overall
a
standard
ipa
i
appreciated
the
bitter
finish
its
one
of
those
beers
you
just
crack
open
on
a
week
night
overall
a
nice
red
ipa
certainly
a
cross
between
torpedo
citra
and
celebration
centennial
with
a
simoce
twist
o
ill
take
this
over
tumbler
any
day
and
hey
fill
the
body
out
a
little
more
and
i
might
just
have
a
new
goto
from
sierra
nevada
as
it
stands
though
this
beer
is
leaning
more
towards
a
session
ale
and
thats
alright
its
quite
refreshing
nicely
balanced
as
to
be
expected
the
hop
profile
is
unique
for
sierra
nevada
and
they
do
it
well
not
stellar
but
drinkable
in
spades
the
taste
is
very
good
dark
red
grapefruit
with
a
hop
flavor
which
is
very
fresh
and
has
slight
herbal
bitter
flavor
with
a
light
caramel
taste
from
the
malt
and
a
mild
alcohol
taste
with
residual
bitterness
as
it
finishes
overall
a
great
ipa
sn
does
a
good
job
with
amber
ales
this
is
no
exception
it
has
a
similarity
to
celebration
and
beer
camp
bloodshot
which
puts
it
in
good
company
very
flavorful
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
unassuming
but
good
finishes
dry
overall
pretty
good
hoppy
red
and
another
solid
sierra
beer
pours
a
perfectly
clear
reddish
color
with
a
size
able
foam
topping
plenty
of
lace
is
left
behind
in
the
pint
glass
aroma
of
caramelized
malt
grapefruit
pine
and
herbs
nice
ipa
like
nose
with
perhaps
a
bit
more
sweetness
than
your
typical
example
of
the
style
in
the
taste
pine
and
pith
from
aggressive
hopping
of
fine
hops
caramel
and
toast
round
out
a
complimentary
malt
base
the
brew
is
bittersweet
leaning
towards
bitter
and
citrus
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
full
flavored
ale
overall
this
is
a
smooth
dangerously
drinkable
ipared
ale
bought
a
case
and
it
was
a
solid
investment
fairly
complex
but
somewhat
muddled
the
malt
character
takes
on
an
almost
overly
kilned
flavor
which
detracts
a
bit
from
the
experience
a
bit
overly
bitter
and
resiny
for
my
palate
and
im
not
a
simcoe
fan
another
highly
enjoyable
sierra
nevada
brew
i
would
have
expected
nothing
else
o
a
nice
fall
seasonal
i
have
this
ranked
ahead
of
tumbler
though
i
still
will
miss
that
beer
sierra
nevada
remains
one
of
the
few
breweries
in
which
ill
buy
any
of
their
beers
blindly
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
o
outstanding
beer
excellent
for
the
cooling
weather
or
for
a
hop
head
looking
for
a
different
take
only
complaint
is
how
thin
it
get
as
it
finishes
but
it
doesnt
detract
much
makes
it
even
more
dangerously
drinkable
definitely
needs
to
be
experienced
and
enjoyed
fresh
bottle
into
a
tulip
pours
a
clear
crimson
with
lasting
head
smells
like
it
was
brewed
for
optimal
shelf
life
hoppy
in
an
ambiguous
way
kind
of
leafy
and
earthy
but
also
faintly
fruity
generally
very
bland
plenty
of
crystal
malt
too
smells
like
a
sierra
beer
basically
very
identifiable
but
also
completely
unexciting
id
elaborate
on
the
flavor
but
it
pretty
much
tastes
exactly
how
ive
described
the
aroma
loads
of
caramel
malt
and
heavily
boiled
hops
with
a
mineral
finish
about
as
exciting
as
any
other
hoppy
sierra
beer
ie
not
even
slightly
fucking
exciting
i
cant
even
be
bothered
to
finish
a
12oz
bottle
of
this
mediocrity
somewhere
between
celebration
ale
torpedo
and
a
nice
amber
ale
for
me
the
hops
feel
fresh
and
inviting
as
it
seems
they
always
are
from
sierra
nevada
a
solid
addition
to
their
lineup
this
is
a
great
beer
im
glad
sn
added
it
to
the
fleet
its
a
nice
variation
on
their
standard
hoppy
goodness
i
do
wish
that
this
was
a
little
brasher
this
is
is
a
great
tasty
drinkable
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
tumbler
but
with
some
caramel
malt
toastiness
and
hops
this
is
another
great
welcome
fall
offering
a
great
hoppy
alternative
to
the
plethora
of
oktoberfest
and
pumpkin
blah
a
six
dressed
up
as
a
nine
its
far
from
my
favorite
sn
seasonal
overall
a
good
new
addition
to
the
sierra
nevada
seasonal
lineup
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
look
forward
to
having
every
year
glad
this
is
listed
under
american
amberred
ale
as
it
meets
halfway
between
that
style
and
a
traditional
sierra
nevada
ipa
a

nice
mahogany

good

aromas
of

too

i
pick
up
this
is
a
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
more
often
if
it
was
available
year
round
as
a
fan
of
sierra
nevada
flipside
is
a
great
change
of
of
pace
from
the
more
straightforward
ipas
that
im
partial
to
with
a
somewhat
more
citrusy
but
less
bitter
flavor
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
smooth
overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
it
might
be
my
favorite
sn
to
date
reminds
me
of
nugget
nectar
but
not
quite
to
that
level
but
close
an
interesting
beer
but
id
need
a
few
more
to
really
say
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
nice
amber
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
small
offwhite
head
with
alot
of
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
very
nice
touch
of
hops
citrus
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
alittle
sweetness
malty
and
some
hopcitrus
notes
medium
body
with
a
nice
little
bitterdry
finish
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
would
buy
again
o
a
nice
little
change
up
from
all
the
oktoberfest
ive
been
guzzling
down
of
late
i
could
see
myself
reaching
for
this
seasonal
again
overall
above
average
if
youre
a
fan
of
sierra
nevada
like
i
am
youre
probably
going
to
try
it
no
matter
what
a
reviewer
writes
this
you
could
pass
on
though
no
flaws
just
quotidian
o
i
really
liked
this
red
ipa
overall
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
marzens
and
pumpkin
ales
associated
with
autumn
a
decent
hoppy
amber
ale
what
with
red
white
and
black
ipas
i
wonder
what
theyll
come
up
with
next
check
this
out
overall
an
average
beer
definitely
not
of
of
sierra
nevadas
best
offerings
glad
i
tried
it
but
also
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
its
easy
to
drink
but
certainly
nothing
memorable
im
surprised
they
used
3
hops
in
this
beer
i
believe
i
can
taste
the
simcoe
but
im
not
sure
i
detect
the
other
varietals
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
red
ipa
but
there
other
choices
in
the
style
segment
that
i
would
pick
first
o
very
solid
red
ipa
it
is
limited
a
bit
by
the
fact
that
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
function
together
seamlessly
atmosphere
is
really
nice
foamy
head
and
plenty
of
thick
lacing
nose
is
bready
with
pine
and
wood
earthy
and
woody
character
consisting
of
hearty
malt
bitter
pecan
shells
and
some
pine
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
more
of
a
hoppy
nutty
amber
than
what
i
would
call
an
ipa
of
any
color
o
a
pretty
damn
good
addition
to
the
sn
line
this
has
classic
sn
flavors
yet
still
retains
its
own
personality
i
would
recommend
getting
some
soon
while
its
at
optimal
freshness
i
hope
they
keep
this
around
and
their
concept
of
in
between
seasons
beers
is
really
intriguing
this
is
far
better
than
i
expected
and
makes
an
excellent
fall
thirst
quencher
tasty
brew
o
solid
i
was
somewhat
reluctant
to
shell
out
18
after
tax
deposit
on
an
unknown
12pack
but
knowing
sierra
nevada
i
figured
the
riskreward
assessment
was
fairly
balanced
and
sure
enough
im
pleased
with
this
beer
its
no
nugget
nectar
but
a
nice
fall
ipa
i
predict
the
11
beers
left
from
the
12pack
wont
last
long
in
my
fridge
overall
a
great
ipa
i
dont
think
this
brewery
could
ever
disappoint
me
overall
a
different
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
sn
offering
but
certainly
in
no
way
bad
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
more
about
the
centennial
than
the
citra
or
simcoe
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
of
a
fruity
hop
character
from
those
but
on
the
other
hand
the
spiciness
of
the
hop
profile
here
fits
the
season
pretty
well
o
do
you
love
hops
you
will
love
this
beer
i
only
wish
there
was
a
way
to
find
out
when
this
beer
was
brewed
im
drinking
it
on
the
east
coast
and
it
was
brewed
on
the
west
coast
but
it
tastes
so
fresh
it
is
crazy
its
very
delicious
and
i
highly
recommend
drinking
it
overall
this
is
another
winner
from
sierra
nevada
the
label
art
and
name
seem
to
suggest
that
this
brew
is
a
sequel
to
their
ruthless
rye
well
sierra
nevada
has
succeeded
in
creating
a
quality
end
of
summer
ipa
like
many
of
sierra
nevadas
brewings
the
foundation
of
the
beer
is
practically
the
same
with
minor
changes
my
only
concern
is
if
the
changes
are
enough
to
warrant
a
whole
new
brand
of
beer
the
fruits
are
definitely
prevalent
but
the
similarity
is
uncanny
o
pretty
good
beer
has
a
very
distinctive
sierra
nevada
taste
to
it
for
a
hoppy
red
ale
the
hops
really
dont
stand
out
though
it
is
well
crafted
and
balanced
the
herbal
and
pungent
hops
dont
pop
out
as
much
as
the
fruity
spicy
complexity
of
the
red
malt
its
a
decent
quaff
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
overall
an
interesting
beer
the
aroma
is
excellent
but
there
seems
to
be
something
of
an
incongruity
between
that
and
the
taste
as
well
as
the
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
measure
but
not
everything
seems
to
work
together
for
me
overall
the
more
i
consume
the
more
i
like
it
i
definitely
like
it
replacing
tumbler
it
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
torpedo
and
ruthless
rye
a
nice
beer
that
works
and
will
be
consistent
in
the
rotation
when
it
arrives
each
year
the
6
2
is
nice
as
well
which
provides
the
opportunity
for
multiples
overall
another
one
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
and
enjoying
this
season
has
the
hop
profile
sierra
nevada
is
known
for
with
more
malt
than
their
ipas
give
it
a
go
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
overall
nice
beer
in
short
a
great
brew
that
im
already
looking
to
go
grab
again
and
enjoy
def
a
bet
worth
drinking
s
few
of
especially
at
the
price
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
16
oz
champaign
flute
half
inch
head
slightly
red
honeycolor
when
held
up
to
a
bright
light
wonderful
aroma
complex
with
citrus
and
hops
flavor
is
quite
good
but
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
definitely
an
ipa
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
full
overall
i
like
thisnot
as
much
as
torpedo
or
sn
stout
but
those
are
different
styles
the
taste
has
a
vague
malty
character
to
start
which
like
the
aroma
is
superseded
by
the
citrus
and
floral
hops
moderately
bitter
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
decent
but
their
torpedo
would
be
my
first
ipa
choice
from
sierra
nevada
12oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
clear
ruby
topped
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
great
retention
and
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
smells
fresh
and
dank
with
some
pine
notes
and
a
tangy
underpinning
of
bready
malt
and
light
tropical
fruit
character
the
taste
has
a
bite
to
it
of
zesty
citrus
and
resins
which
spreads
lightly
herbal
and
tropical
notes
out
across
the
palate
the
malts
definitely
have
a
presence
here
but
arent
overly
intrusive
on
the
hops
with
a
mix
of
caramel
sweetness
and
doughy
notes
bitter
and
piney
on
the
finish
with
some
lingering
herbal
and
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
with
an
easy
feeling
creaminess
to
the
carbonation
there
is
a
touch
of
warmth
here
but
those
herbal
and
oily
textures
from
the
hops
really
keep
this
smooth
this
was
a
nice
hoppy
red
ale
with
just
the
right
mix
of
robust
flavors
that
i
really
enjoy
in
the
style
perfect
for
fall
drinking
overall
feels
like
a
shade
above
a
4
more
of
a
treat
that
a
typical
standby
overall
to
me
its
a
tossup
between
the
tumbler
and
this
one
the
tumber
being
a
bit
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
but
still
being
a
great
brown
ale
and
this
one
offering
great
flavors
but
nothing
really
being
that
memorable
for
me
both
are
very
good
beers
that
are
almost
excellent
o
overall
flipside
is
another
great
brew
from
sierra
nevada
glad
to
have
this
beer
in
the
seasonal
rotation
cheers
candied
citrus
bomb
extremely
balanced
and
juicy
effin
good
o
i
really
dont
know
what
sn
were
trying
to
accomplish
with
flipside
but
we
are
done
with
sns
summer
offering
and
its
still
a
little
early
to
enjoy
a
brown
ale
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
the
answer
flipside
red
ipa
just
bc
what
we
think
is
summer
and
vacations
are
gone
doesnt
mean
the
hot
weather
is
not
just
yet
in
comes
flipside
and
just
at
the
right
time
i
will
admit
that
i
hope
tumbler
remains
their
fall
seasonal
but
hey
if
you
want
to
keep
your
4
seasonals
and
add
an
in
between
brew
while
we
wait
for
the
next
then
it
puts
a
smile
on
my
face
the
seasonal
between
the
seasonals
flipside
is
worth
the
try
and
an
instant
sierra
nevada
classic
easy
to
drink
i
like
the
maltyness
of
this
a
nice
change
of
pace
though
i
like
a
dry
finish
to
any
ipa
the
sharp
hop
flavor
and
poignant
bitterness
is
abrupt
and
aggressive
not
because
of
its
reckless
use
of
hops
but
instead
because
of
its
lack
of
proper
malt
support
still
the
ale
is
a
refreshing
ipa
that
begs
for
pizza
pairing
thankfully
theres
much
more
of
a
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
dry
bitter
hops
that
linger
over
the
sweet
and
spicy
malt
notes
into
a
sticky
dry
finish
dank
and
resinous
with
grass
and
pine
needle
flavor
as
well
as
some
subtle
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
this
is
countered
by
a
sweet
malt
backbone
that
has
a
strong
caramel
flavor
theres
also
some
toffee
bread
faint
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
a
spicy
rye
component
that
nicely
compliments
the
hop
profile
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
hoppy
beer
for
the
fall
season
o
does
sierra
nevada
ever
brew
a
bad
beer
they
may
not
have
the
best
in
any
specific
category
but
everything
they
brew
just
seems
to
be
solid
and
drinkable
this
one
is
no
exception
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
reddish
coppery
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
light
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
fruit
flavor
follows
with
a
nice
sweet
caramel
malt
body
with
grassy
and
piney
hops
finishing
with
light
generic
hops
and
some
citrus
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
nicely
balanced
and
a
good
light
red
ale
with
nothing
that
really
stands
out
i
would
have
this
again
but
would
probably
look
for
one
of
the
the
more
bold
options
if
i
was
specifically
looking
for
a
red
o
a
fine
medium
strength
red
ipa
delivers
just
what
the
season
calls
for
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
torpedo
but
the
gorgeous
copper
color
and
huge
light
beige
head
makes
up
for
it
by
adding
psychological
flavor
drinkable
and
sessionable
hard
to
imagine
a
better
replacement
for
tumbler
if
thats
what
this
is
intended
to
be
a
happy
choice
for
my
150th
ba
review
and
600th
beer
karma
point
nice
interesting
tweaner
brew
between
late
summerearly
fall
description
on
the
carton
reeled
me
in
very
interesting
mix
in
my
opinion
tastes
like
a
mesh
up
between
an
amber
from
an
established
michigan
brewery
and
a
sn
pale
ale
and
it
works
to
me
was
a
little
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
for
either
an
amber
or
an
ipa
a
great
addition
to
the
fall
lineup
o
certainly
not
the
worst
amber
ive
tried
but
has
a
few
rough
edges
drinkable
but
could
have
been
better
like
most
sierra
nevada
brews
very
well
made
and
good
to
the
last
drop
o
pretty
good
brew
but
i
preferred
the
imperial
red
that
came
in
the
beer
camp
pack
a
more
vibrant
brew
overall
solid
beer
good
flavors
but
what
really
is
the
point
of
this
release
has
a
celebration
and
torpedo
flavor
mix
in
with
the
hops
malts
and
spices
is
this
a
primer
to
get
us
ready
for
celebration
theres
nothing
new
special
or
unique
about
this
beer
other
then
its
drinkable
and
has
good
flavor
overall
i
quite
like
this
and
like
seeing
a
new
seasonal
from
an
established
brewery
i
dont
know
what
makes
this
an
ipa
sierra
nevada
tends
to
brew
them
on
the
maltier
side
but
torpedo
and
celebration
are
still
fine
examples
of
the
style
flipside
is
not
decent
enough
beer
but
the
concept
reeks
of
false
advertising
and
phony
ipa
marketing
3
ok
not
must
have
well
lately
ive
made
a
point
to
only
review
beers
i
like
this
is
not
that
review
if
they
let
me
i
could
do
this
review
in
one
word
mediocre
or
boring
weak
uninspired
average
you
choose
or
my
choice
why
color
is
uninspiring
red
smells
and
tastes
slightly
bitter
hops
not
very
drinkable
and
rather
poor
mouthfeel
the
good
is
that
i
only
paid
1
49
and
i
only
got
one
waste
of
time
just
another
good
beer
from
sierra
nevada
no
surprise
here
this
was
even
better
than
the
same
kind
i
had
on
labor
day
that
i
did
not
rate
would
try
it
again
overall
passable
not
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
too
much
roastpine
astringency
clashing
were
i
prefer
caramelcitrus
for
this
style
3
6
o
sierra
nevada
has
set
a
high
bar
with
everything
they
do
but
i
was
slightly
underwhelmed
by
this
one
as
an
amber
ale
its
pretty
good
as
a
red
ipa
its
pretty
average
other
than
ovila
this
must
be
the
biggest
letdown
i
have
had
from
sierra
nevada
really
surprised
they
made
this
this
beer
is
a
great
idea
that
was
executely
poorly
on
paper
this
should
be
a
hit
3
of
my
favorite
hop
varieties
together
with
a
sierra
nevada
pedigree
its
not
even
meh
its
not
good
at
all
i
will
say
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
which
is
typical
of
sn
brews
a
good
beer
but
still
feel
a
little
disappointed
good
value
pours
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
ambertawny
with
a
great
looking
billowing
light
beige
head
atopgreat
color
and
a
great
headit
just
looks
like
fall
aromas
of
citric
hops
and
nutty
malt
with
light
caramel
sweetness
the
palate
is
alot
like
aromas
with
a
good
shot
of
citric
hops
intertwined
with
nutty
maltiness
with
a
little
brown
sugar
in
the
finish
a
solid
hoppy
amber
alei
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
this
fall
overall
great
beer
gets
a
really
good
complex
flavor
of
amber
and
ipa
in
my
opinion
and
should
be
tried
by
lovers
of
both
o
a
solid
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
all
but
its
nothing
new
tastes
very
much
like
a
sierra
nevada
beer
which
is
a
good
thing
but
again
its
nothing
new
t
very
smooth
balancing
some
light
piny
hops
with
caramel
malt
again
the
bready
and
caramel
malt
flavors
are
a
bit
too
prominent
for
me
and
this
shows
more
of
the
red
side
than
the
ipa
side
toasted
malt
light
pine
resin
grapefruit
pith
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
in
the
end
the
aroma
is
quite
exciting
the
flavor
is
nice
but
could
be
more
exciting
12oz
bottle
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
thick
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
caramel
malts
and
bread
the
taste
is
orange
peel
with
some
piney
hops
more
of
the
bread
and
caramel
malts
citrus
peel
at
the
finish
nice
amount
of
bitterness
tthroughout
oily
mouthfeel
with
some
hints
of
alcohol
heat
overall
its
a
solid
hoppy
amber
and
a
welcome
addition
to
sierra
nevadas
seasonal
rotation
this
is
an
ipa
for
sure
but
build
upon
a
unique
backbone
of
malts
which
really
isnt
evident
in
the
flavor
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
and
i
like
that
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
really
much
of
a
red
ale
despite
expectations
i
would
still
say
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
worth
trying
the
overall
quality
is
here
and
you
know
right
away
its
a
sierra
nevada
beer
the
malts
and
hop
bitterness
are
well
balanced
and
its
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
copper
color
khaki
colored
head
fades
to
a
thin
ring
few
splotches
of
lace
smell
dried
tropical
fruit
grapefruit
sharp
pine
slightly
catty
slightly
fruity
and
brown
sugary
in
the
back
taste
caramel
grapefruit
piney
nectarine
towards
the
finish
oily
carb
pushes
to
creamy
then
too
far
to
over
carbed
then
fades
back
to
oily
again
pretty
good
kind
of
fits
an
early
fall
season
12oz
bottle
from
a
sixer
that
cost
9
so
1
49
per
bottle
dark
orangered
color
super
huge
head
which
is
one
thing
sierra
nevada
never
fails
at
the
beers
always
seem
to
be
carbonated
just
right
and
have
a
good
mouthfeel
it
sort
of
looks
like
celebration
aroma
is
hops
pine
honey
pine
tree
sap
flavor
is
bitter
hoppy
lemons
this
is
a
really
subtle
but
well
done
beer
which
is
no
surprise
from
sierra
nevada
their
beers
rarely
slap
you
in
the
face
but
its
hard
to
say
they
arent
wellrounded
i
went
back
for
another
sixer
o
good
sweet
flavors
with
lighter
citrus
hop
qualities
standard
decent
sierra
brew
overall
a
solid
new
seasonal
from
sierra
nevada
not
all
i
hoped
when
i
read
it
was
brewed
with
whole
cone
simco
and
citra
but
still
delicious
none
of
the
less
going
to
look
forward
to
seeing
this
again
next
year
i
have
been
late
to
the
party
on
this
one
an
excellent
new
seasonal
from
sierra
nevada
the
pour
is
clear
and
radiant
almost
ruby
red
its
that
bright
the
head
is
just
off
white
and
very
dense
it
leaves
some
lacing
as
it
drinks
too
aromas
of
dryer
red
malt
fresh
hay
jolly
rancher
candies
and
some
citric
hops
explode
from
the
glass
its
complex
for
a
red
beer
and
just
as
hoppy
as
i
was
hoping
for
it
to
be
the
taste
doesnt
get
much
of
the
candy
stuff
just
a
hint
of
artificial
fruit
sweetness
i
can
only
attribute
to
the
grains
the
hops
are
more
bitter
than
flavorful
which
hurts
this
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
kick
at
the
end
too
like
a
kiss
of
rye
malt
was
added
but
thats
all
speculation
fuller
bodied
yet
still
refreshing
they
did
an
great
job
with
this
and
i
cant
wait
to
score
a
sixer
at
the
store
and
evaluate
it
more
thoroughly
perfect
for
fall
enjoyable
smells
great
tastes
good
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
yesterday
for
9
bucks
pours
a
nice
amber
color
a
bit
darker
than
your
typical
amber
but
it
looks
really
nice
pretty
good
head
very
clear
smell
is
a
little
more
subtle
than
i
was
expecting
but
its
a
nice
melony
slightly
skunky
smell
that
you
can
get
with
citra
in
the
mix
not
what
you
typically
find
in
an
amber
but
its
interesting
and
it
works
taste
was
very
good
again
im
a
little
partial
to
that
classic
cascadey
taste
in
an
amber
but
this
is
a
nice
change
up
mouthfeel
is
excellent
its
got
a
nice
smooth
slipperiness
to
it
that
i
really
like
all
told
a
unique
and
tasty
american
amber
ale
that
you
should
try
if
you
dig
that
style
of
beer
good
stuff
this
beer
looks
amazing
it
has
this
incredibly
vibrant
caramelruby
hue
with
a
nice
lacing
theres
a
fantastic
aroma
to
iti
can
tell
its
fresh
because
the
hops
are
just
vibrant
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
pine
and
grapefruit
thats
overshadowed
by
a
sticky
dank
resiny
note
and
held
together
with
a
caramellymalty
backbone
the
aroma
profile
carries
over
to
the
flavor
with
a
smooth
and
surprisingly
mellow
bitterness
lending
some
complexity
to
the
lingering
stickygreenmalty
taste
its
good
stuff
a
little
malty
kinda
catty
slightly
dank
its
solid
and
scratches
that
itch
and
for
the
price
its
a
steal
one
i
will
definitely
seek
out
again
outweighing
the
factors
this
is
not
as
drinkable
as
id
like
it
to
be
id
sooner
have
celebration
than
have
another
bottle
of
this
anytime
soon
the
hoppy
profile
gets
lost
in
between
the
dry
gritty
malty
character
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
shows
flavors
i
havent
quite
seen
before
in
a
hoppy
amber
ale
not
a
bad
choice
from
the
fall
but
a
little
too
heavy
and
lacking
of
refreshing
characteristics
i
enjoy
in
the
style
not
a
misstep
by
sn
but
definitely
below
what
theyre
capable
of
doing
the
flavor
profile
will
be
familiar
to
anyone
who
has
had
one
of
sns
pale
ale
offerings
in
a
nutshell
it
could
be
described
as
a
maltier
snpa
dry
and
moderately
hoppy
from
start
to
finish
slick
mouthfeel
with
soft
smooth
carbonation
fundamentally
its
a
good
beer
but
its
boring
and
not
all
that
distinguishable
from
sns
evergrowing
hoppy
beer
catalog
nice
citrus
hop
nose
piney
with
a
bit
caramel
on
the
heavy
side
of
being
medium
bodied
good
malt
foundation
and
brisk
carbonation
caramel
and
toasty
sweet
malts
hide
below
waves
of
big
juicy
citrusy
hops
big
bright
bitter
finish
but
not
overly
so
good
beer
nothing
to
stand
outish
but
it
is
good
i
can
see
this
beer
going
bad
very
quickly
as
the
big
malt
body
will
taste
pretty
bad
on
its
own
once
those
hops
start
to
fade
lovely
copper
color
clear
body
and
two
finger
thick
foamy
head
made
the
pour
look
good
in
a
mug
the
aroma
was
not
as
hoppy
as
expected
which
did
have
the
benefit
of
some
nutty
caramel
malts
show
through
the
taste
was
also
a
good
deal
sweeter
than
a
typical
ipa
at
first
with
syrupy
first
impression
upon
staying
longer
in
the
mouth
the
beer
suddenly
seemed
to
start
to
get
citric
and
the
finish
was
quite
bitter
with
a
drawnout
aftertaste
quite
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
first
impression
but
let
down
a
little
by
a
watery
feel

overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
one
i
will
certainly
go
to
over
and
over
again
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
more
of
a
hoppy
red
masquerading
as
a
red
ipa
on
its
label
im
a
little
sad
that
this
is
going
to
replace
tumbler
as
the
fall
seasonal
but
it
being
a
good
beer
helps
to
soften
the
blow
o
every
time
i
sample
a
new
sierra
nevada
beer
i
always
expect
it
to
be
at
least
solid
and
this
is
more
than
that
actually
i
also
dont
expect
them
to
blow
me
away
and
it
doesnt
its
exactly
what
i
expect
from
them
and
thats
a
hoppy
wellcrafted
brew
with
no
mindblowing
moments
or
unexpected
twists
basically
good
everyday
beer
for
the
fall
weather
overall
impression
very
sierra
nevadalike
beer
seems
to
have
a
house
flavor
im
not
complaining
i
love
it
however
i
dont
see
much
of
a
range
in
their
beers
other
than
bigfoot
and
celebration
none
of
their
hoppy
offerings
seem
all
that
different
not
complaining
just
noting
if
its
available
ill
have
it
again
o
4
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
by
any
means
id
much
rather
have
a
hop
head
red
or
a
red
rocket
ale
if
i
just
wanted
hops
id
get
an
american
ipa
or
iipa
amazing
addition
to
sierras
seasonal
lineup
this
beer
looks
like
a
red
ale
drinks
like
a
black
ipa
and
finishes
like
a
pale
ale
sierras
done
well
with
this
one
o
packs
a
good
punch
of
flavor
for
being
only
a
hair
over
6
abv
heard
its
replacing
the
tumbler
now
three
of
the
four
seasons
are
hopped
up
beers
would
have
rather
kept
tumbler
and
replaced
summerfest
but
i
dont
make
those
calls
this
may
not
be
the
most
explosive
or
impressive
amber
but
its
got
great
qualities
and
is
in
such
an
easy
to
drink
package
and
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
red
amber
ale
and
this
delivers
the
goods
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
pillowy
head
that
leaves
drippy
sheets
on
the
glass
hoppy
aromas
herbal
and
resinous
dark
woody
and
earthy
oily
spicy
hop
flavors
over
a
dark
malt
sweetness
and
some
tea
juicy
citrus
and
pine
sap
mediumplus
body
bitter
and
properly
carbonated
to
keep
it
highly
drinkable
a
well
crafted
hoppy
beer
as
expected
from
sierra
nevada
odi
enjoy
this
beer
great
hop
selection
tumbler
is
legit
but
this
is
a
viable
alternative
o
a
little
less
smooth
than
some
of
the
other
beers
i
have
had
featuring
the
citra
hop
pretty
intense
bitterness
and
weak
malt
leads
to
some
imbalance
solid
but
not
great
o
an
interesting
red
ipa
but
i
think
i
like
a
hoppy
red
because
there
is
more
balance
worth
a
try
o
considering
i
dislike
amber
beers
and
amber
ipas
this
is
pretty
damn
good
it
has
a
nice
bitternesscitrus
balance
but
i
find
this
style
red
ipas
to
have
a
sort
of
abrasive
aspect
to
it
definitely
worth
trying
but
the
fact
that
its
knocking
out
tumbler
as
the
autumn
seasonal
greatly
disappoints
me
as
a
red
ipa
this
is
pretty
decent
but
as
a
fall
seasonal
give
me
a
nice
toasty
brown
ale
please
o
a
very
solid
hoppy
red
that
isnt
quite
as
good
as
something
like
oh
say
tocobaga
but
since
i
cant
get
any
ccb
here
in
louisiana
itll
do
o
my
new
favorite
lowerpriced
ipa
like
sn
torpedo
this
certainly
puts
many
higher
priced
ipas
to
shame
highly
recommended
o
sn
does
not
disappoint
when
it
comes
to
ipas
this
is
no
exception
as
the
hops
shine
even
with
the
maltiness
of
an
amber
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
really
compliment
the
tropical
and
citrusy
notes
from
the
hops
worthy
of
a
purchase
if
you
enjoy
sns
ipas
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
earthy
malt
and
grain
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earthy
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
definitely
has
citrus
and
tropical
aspects
as
described
but
there
is
an
underlying
earthiness
that
is
battling
for
attention
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
recommendation
is
in
the
air
its
worthy
at
1
9012oz
but
not
to
buy
a
12pk
of
sn
has
done
and
will
do
better
i
never
thought
i
wouldnt
highly
enjoy
a
beer
hopped
up
with
citra
simcoe
and
centennial
its
not
bad
but
its
not
as
interesting
as
one
would
expect
reguardless
if
i
enjoy
it
or
not
the
craftsmanship
is
clearly
always
there
with
sierra
nevada
o
its
departs
from
the
cascade
signature
that
makes
up
their
pale
ale
but
the
citrasimcoecentennial
additions
really
dont
amount
to
much
more
then
just
light
notes
from
each
hop
variety
its
less
tropical
then
the
description
indicates
and
has
a
sort
of
ruthless
rye
malty
profile
but
minus
the
actual
rye
spice
that
makes
that
beer
so
great
overall
just
a
solid
hoppy
sn
beer
o
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
for
sure
it
comes
in
just
a
half
a
tick
below
my
favorite
hoppy
sn
ofeerings
like
hoptimum
ruthless
rye
and
celebration
though
overall
if
you
know
sierra
nevada
well
i
think
youll
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
this
will
taste
like
before
you
even
take
a
sip
this
is
classic
sn
not
straying
far
from
the
hop
profile
that
has
brought
them
all
their
amazing
success
as
a
result
its
not
so
unique
from
their
core
lineup
unfortunately
ive
heard
rumor
this
is
replacing
the
tumbler
brown
as
their
fall
seasonal
if
so
disappointing
tumbler
was
at
least
a
change
of
pace
from
their
mainstays
i
see
this
as
no
more
than
their
torpedo
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
as
a
changeup
its
good
yes
but
all
too
similar
following
this
up
with
their
celebration
just
means
more
of
the
same
overall
a
very
quality
and
easy
drinking
ipa
from
sierra
nevada
fans
of
rye
will
really
like
this
one
id
say
this
one
is
definitely
right
for
this
time
of
year
nice
job
to
sierra
nevada
for
concocting
this
gem
overall
another
very
nice
hoppy
offering
from
sierra
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
ruthless
but
more
balanced
and
a
touch
lighter
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
over
the
next
few
weeks
a
welcome
addition
to
the
sierra
nevada
line
good
overall
flavor
a
nice
early
fall
beer
a
nice
sub
to
all
the
oktoberfest
beers
that
spew
forth
around
now
nice
redamber
color
a
nice
spicy
fruity
smell
yet
it
says
on
the
bottle
a
tropical
citrusy
hoppy
flavor
it
is
hoppy
a
little
bitter
and
definitely
sierra
nevada
not
tropical
and
not
too
citrusy
but
do
not
get
me
wrong
a
good
solid
beer
if
you
want
a
nice
late
summer
fall
offering
and
are
tired
if
all
the
oktoberfests
that
seem
to
get
more
watered
down
each
year
then
pick
this
up
super
fresh
noticed
at
the
grocery
store
and
knew
it
was
just
released
the
description
promised
tropical
fruit
and
with
the
citra
i
thought
that
there
would
be
instead
the
nose
was
a
danker
version
of
celebration
it
was
a
really
good
beer
but
still
classic
sierra
nevada
nice
and
bitter
and
smooth
just
hoping
for
something
a
little
different
overall
a
solid
beer
from
sierra
nevada
not
exactly
like
the
description
says
but
it
is
tasty
maybe
a
little
unbalanced
the
bitterness
lingers
a
little
too
long
kind
of
hides
the
malt
presence
but
i
can
tell
this
is
going
to
actually
age
well
a
few
months
i
mean
o
a
solid
beer
i
will
be
drinking
this
all
season
sierra
nevada
rarely
disappoints
o
very
solid
pint
right
there
perhaps
my
favorite
red
ipa
to
date
hops
come
from
a
different
angle
than
most
american
ipas
plenty
of
room
for
more
assertive
hop
bitterness
that
would
shy
from
being
too
one
sided
malt
plays
a
great
role
in
this
beer
though
and
this
is
quite
drinkable
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
with
no
defects
of
any
sort
might
as
well
buy
two
six
packs
because
you
will
want
to
finish
them
both
the
same
night
o
this
is
probably
the
most
flavorful
beer
that
ive
had
under
4
5
sad
that
i
waited
this
long
to
try
it
as
its
one
of
the
best
session
beers
that
ive
had
hops
are
the
most
prominent
flavor
has
a
pleasant
citrus
and
pine
tatse
i
like
less
hops
for
the
style
but
stone
didnt
over
do
it
the
maltiness
is
hiding
in
the
background
pretty
good
levitation
is
a
great
beer
without
a
doubt
a
stone
beer
it
has
hops
and
a
malty
flavor
lighter
then
stones
other
brews
but
still
fantastic
pours
dark
reddish
black
with
very
little
head
has
a
light
coffee
aroma
watered
down
roasted
malt
taste
ending
in
a
more
bitter
coffee
taste
okay
beer
more
of
a
porter
than
a
red
ale
a
little
watered
down
but
decent
o
its
really
sad
to
see
this
one
go
very
unstone
but
in
a
good
way
subtle
without
giving
up
complexity
poured
into
a
stone
gargoyle
pint
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
and
heavy
lacing
aroma

light

with

a
quite
hop

amber

but
the
resinous
hops
are
well
supported
by
the
malt
and
the
peppery
finish
is
great
sessionable
ambers
are
not
one
of
my
go
to
styles
but
this
is
quite
nice
and
id
have
it
again
if
it
wasnt
being
discontinued
glad
i
got
to
try
it
while
it
still
is
around
it
is
very
flavorful
and
hoppy
for
its
abv
this
is
probably
my
favorite
amber
ale
its
a
shame
its
being
discontinued
wonderful
citrusy
aroma
and
very
nicely
balanced
it
has
a
much
bigger
body
than
many
of
the
numerous
new
session
ipas
around
these
days
i
guess
its
designation
as
an
amber
sealed
its
fate
i
rate
my
beers
by
style
and
i
think
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
in
this
category

although
low
on

scale
very
good
overall
overall
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
well
its
a
very
stonelike
take
on
an
amber
id
drink
it
again
given
a
choice
but
a
bit
more
malt
character
would
improve
the
experience
the
somewhat
low
abv
is
pretty
apparent
in
this
one
its
not
bad
but
it
felt
and
tasted
a
bit
weak
to
me
poured

nice

caramel
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
rather
hop
forward
amber
ale
quite
unbalanced
and
very
much
a
stone
version
of
the
style
flavor
begins
quite
bitter
following
the
aroma
with
pine
resin
and
grassy
herbal
hop
flavors
mingling
with
toasted
malt
and
a
very
faint
presence
of
caramel
middle
continues
to
be
bitter
with
notes
of
pine

grassy
hops
and

aftertaste
is
bitter
with
notes
of
pine
resin
grapefruit
peel
and
light
crackerlike
malt
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
rather
bitter
amber
ale
balanced
very
much
towards
the
hops
with
just
enough
malt
to
provide
some
basic
semblance
of
balance
not
horrible
but
a
bit
simple
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
resinous
drying
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
drying
beer
that
urges
you
to
drink
more
overall
this
is
alright
for
an
amber
i
feel
it
is
a
bit
too
hoppy
at
the
expense
of
other
flavors
and
comes
across
as
unbalanced
even
in
comparison
to
other
hoppy
ambers
such
as
marbles
not
bad
but
lacking
o
good
beer
couldve
been
better
though
somewhat
too
light
for
my
palate
pretty
hoppy
for
an
amber
ale
taste
okay
but
very
watery
thin
feel
disappointing
love
this
beer
the
malts
and
hops
are
perfect
together
in
this
beer
o
a
good
amber
have
had
this
before
and
thought
it
was
solid
a
good
low
abv
beer
that
could
only
be
improved
with
a
touch
more
heft
and
substance
a
great
choice
for
a
sessionable
ale
has
great
flavor
for
such
a

thats
because
of
the

beers
are

and
this
is
less
of
an

ale
than
it
is
a
red

albeit
sessionable
i
think
the
low

makes
the

taste
watery

makes

when
poured
into
a

glass
earthy
malty
dry
hopped
but
not
overpowered
by

good

and

enjoyed
this
very
much
and
will
revisit
kind
of
flat
decent
taste
great
red
ale
first
try
of
a
beer
from
stone
brewing
its
okay
apart
from
some
hoppiness
there
isnt
much
there
330ml
bottle
sampled
just
didnt
care
for
the
flavor
glass
tulip
overall
a
9497
shocked
but
not
shocked
its
a
stone
product
so
my
expectations
were
high
it
surpassed
them
i
would
say
that
this
will
be
my
goto
session
beer
from
now
on
so
smooth
so
much
flavor
lovely
hop
profile
o
stone
offers
a
lovely
take
on
this
style
substantially
beefing
up
the
hop
presence
in
this
style
to
really
add
their
signature
touch
on
it
while
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
all
the
time
it
serves
as
an
absolutely
perfect
beer
for
bbqs
game
night
or
just
any
night
when
youre
looking
for
great
hop
flavors
in
a
beer
that
doesnt
weigh
you
down
too
much
always
enjoy
stones
beers
always
full
of
flavor
and
an
all
around
great
beer
this
one
does
not
disappoint
but
there
was
a
slight
turnoff
as
the
flavor
was
ok
and
the
smell
and
appearance
were
really
nice
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
way
too
carbonated
i
do
not
see
a
dateon
the
bottle
so
i
do
not
know
how
fresh
or
how
old
this
is
too
much
carbonation
spoiled
the
overall
flavor
but
still
a
decent
beer
as
far
as
the
stone
beers
i
have
tried
this
one
is
on
the
bottom
of
the
list
thanks
kirk
for
this
one
a
great
midweek
beer
that
satisfies
without
the
morning
guilt
of
higher
abv
counterparts
notes
a
session
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
yet
flavorful
very
nice
flavor
profile
and
goes
down
very
easily
kudos
to
stone
i
had
been
down
on
them
lately
with
their
base
ipa
and
the
go
to
ipa
but
they
have
redeemed
themselves
with
this
one
mahoghony
brown
with
a
half
inch
thick
tightly
knit
beige
head
great
clarity
and
brussels
lacing
is
present
aroma
of
caramel
and
tropical
fruit
scented
hops
the
flavor
is
more
tropical
fruit
hop
forward
with
caramel
malt
while
there
is
a
longyet
mild
hop
fade
there
is
more
of
a
caramel
malt
aftertaste
the
body
is
lighter
and
yet
lightly
sticky
and
moderately
carbonated
i
think
it
must
be
due
to
the
lighter
abv
looks
good
smells
ok
the
taste
is
way
too
spicy
for
how
light
mouthfeel
and
alchohol
is
has
stay
away
from
this
beer
2010
on
tap
the
dark
color
portends
the
caramel
rich
flavor
both
of
which
belie
the
easy
going
body
too
bad
im
not
more
taken
wthe
flavor
as
this
could
become
a
fast
friend
o
not
bad
but
not
awesome
its
a
good
beer
not
the
best
by
stone
would
go
well
with
pizza
o
more
complex
than
some
ambers
a
very
nice
big
tasting
beer
particularly
relative
to
the
abv
o
a
very
sessionable
brew
that
is
easily
drinkable
yet
flavorful
overall
a
good
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
excellent
brew
d
really
nice
hop
blaster
but
honestly
if
i
had
known
about
the
low
abv
i
wouldve
gone
with
another
stone
selection
this
pours
a
caramel
amber
in
color
its
much
darker
than
i
remembered
with
a
thick
cap
of
khaki
foam
theres
a
light
and
lemony
roast
aroma
the
flavor
has
an
upfront
piney
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
burnt
caramel
and
something
which
makes
me
think
of
burnt
popcorn
as
it
finishes
theres
so
much
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
o
id
love
to
try
this
fresher
right
now
it
seems
a
touch
stale
that
and
i
could
use
some
more
estery
action
to
make
it
properly
great
stone
makes
other
beer
that
id
go
after
first
but
this
would
make
a
decent
fallback
nonetheless
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
carmelly
to
start
grapefruit
in
the
main
body
and
pine
to
finish
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
it
o
very
flavorful
with
a
really
nice
hop
presence
and
quite
sessionable
due
to
the
low
abv
definitely
one
i
would
grab
again
and
i
cant
believe
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
tried
it
o
a
very
very
solid
drinking
beer
great
balance
and
a
very
good
balanced
hoppy
amber
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
and
the
taste
was
missing
just
a
hint
of
something
overall
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
from
start
to
finish
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
although
this
beer
is
available
year
round
i
recommend
it
be
enjoyed
in
the
waning
summerearly
fall
months
as
many
amber
ales
are
not
quite
a
session
drinking
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
around
to
enjoy
from
time
to
time
all
in
all
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
from
start
to
finish
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
on
the
palate
it
drinks
quite
thick
with
a
burning
fast
bitterness
that
fades
before
the
clean
aftertaste
much
more
malt
character
than
expected
but
its
nicely
countered
by
both
hop
flavoring
and
bittering
the
bittering
is
a
touch
more
than
i
prefer
but
depth
of
malt
flavor
and
citrus
keep
me
content
overall
a
very
good
beer
to
sum
it
up
could
use
a
little
more
depth
in
my
opinion
but
still
worth
having
again
o
this
beer
has
a
good
hop
flavor
i
would
prefer
some
more
presence
from
the
malt
but
that
would
most
likely
push
this
beer
farther
from
session
territory
if
you
want
a
beer
with
a
low
abv
and
big
hop
presence
this
is
exactly
that
for
me
personally
with
this
amount
of
hops
the
lack
of
body
from
the
lower
abv
takes
away
from
this
one
stone
levitation
ale
45
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
not
one
i
would
revisit
this
ale
pours
a
gorgeous
deep
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
lasts
well
into
the
beer
it
does
finally
give
way
to
a
nice
film
and
spiderweb
lacing
the
aroma
is
more
subtle
than
ive
come
to
expect
from
stone
but
delicious
none
the
less
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
with
an
underlying
hoppy
bitterness
mostly
citrus
and
pine
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
at
first
with
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
notes
this
is
followed
by
a
bit
of
a
bitter
hop
bite
that
resolves
to
a
nicely
balanced
finish
the
ale
sips
quite
light
and
easy
almost
too
much
so
id
honestly
like
a
little
more
coating
and
lasting
flavor
with
this
one
this
is
a
nice
amberred
ale
but
nowhere
near
the
best
of
the
offerings
out
there
overall
very
balanced
and
tasty
has
a
nice
hop
profile
and
is
very
robust
for
a
session
beer
o
its
a
good
refreshing
ale
a
lot
flavor
for
4
4
abv
a
nice
choice
if
you
want
to
kick
back
a
6pk
with
a
buddy
but
dont
want
to
get
smashed
and
dont
want
a
lager
o
while
not
my
favorite
red
ale
around
this
is
still
a
good
solid
beer
with
an
abv
of
4
4
this
would
be
a
decent
brew
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
a
few
good
middle
of
the
road
standard
ale
color
is
reddish
caramel
nose
is
clean
but
not
floral
in
the
least
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
end
which
is
welcomed
the
carbonation
is
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
drinkable
daytime
beer
when
you
want
to
enjoy
multiple
drinks
over
an
extended
period
of
time
with
a
4
4
abv
this
is
expected
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
big
cloudy
puffy
marshmellowy
head
smells
like
hops
and
citrus
a
somewhat
chewy
thin
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
hops
and
citrus
are
balanced
nicely
with
a
faint
malty
undertone
lots
of
flavor
and
super
sessionable
a
great
beer
for
working
in
the
yard
on
a
hot
day
o
not
bad
at
all
but
not
my
favorite
from
the
category
still
favoring
censored
from
lagunitas
in
northern
california
the
verdict
pretty
good
less
bitter
than
many
stone
offerings
but
plenty
of
flavor
pretty
boozy
for
the
low
abv
its
not
the
first
amber
ale
ill
reach
for
but
theres
a
good
chance
that
i
will
reach
for
it
im
a
hop
head
and
im
surprised
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
levitation
ale
theres
a
great
amount
of
piney
sharp
citrusy
hops
its
definitely
more
towards
the
bitter
side
but
not
as
bitter
as
some
other
ales
i
have
had
theres
also
a
pleasant
lightness
to
the
beer
o
nothing
terribly
unique
about
this
beer
like
a
fool
i
imagined
maybe
this
would
be
the
black
sheep
stone
beer
that
wasnt
hopped
to
high
hell
on
the
other
hand
this
might
just
be
the
most
drinkable
and
my
favorite
of
stones
lighterhued
ales
that
ive
had
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
other
inferior
beers
with
similar
alcohol
contents
but
not
much
else
is
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
with
a
nice
balanced
flavor
i
honestly
had
to
double
check
the
label
to
believe
it
was
only
4
4
if
stones
goal
was
pack
as
much
flavor
into
a
lowalcohol
beer
as
possible
they
accomplished
that
masterfully
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
your
noncraft
drinking
friends
to
it
is
solid
but
doesnt
overwhelm
in
any
way
this
beer
was
unexpectedly
light
i
know
it
is
4
4
but
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
so
tame
there
was
some
good
flavor
there
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
most
commercial
beers
were
like
this
we
would
have
a
better
world
in
general
but
for
a
stone
brew
not
impressed
like
the
nose
the
taste
has
an
exquisite
pine
grass
and
floral
character
that
is
a
bit
more
forward
than
any
biscuit
malts
but
they
still
do
not
take
everything
over
drinkable
and
fascinating
o
this
beer
is
so
good
and
i
think
it
deserves
a
way
better
rating
than
the
one
it
has
the
taste
and
feel
is
so
refreshing
that
im
going
to
start
buying
packs
of
these
for
a
goto
beer
this
is
truly
some
good
stuff
overall
i
love
this
beer
the
only
thing
holding
back
my
scores
is
that
i
would
like
the
malt
to
be
a
little
more
of
a
factor
overall
i
really
like
this
and
at
4
4
abv
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
one
i
should
have
reviewed
long
ago
as
it
has
always
gone
down
easy
to
me
this
brew
competes
with
other
full
bodied
brews
that
are
absolutely
sessionable
and
wins
this
is
my
new
favorite
light
beer
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
somehow
ive
avoided
this
but
its
a

an

come
to
mind
this
one
of
the
best
light
beers
i
had
the
perfect
session
beer
a
session
bastard
dont
look
for
depth
here
and
you
will
love
this
o
this
is
a
very
light
and
drinkable
beer
given
what
stone
does
with
beers
like
beefing
them
up
this
is
quite
a
light
beer
not
much
to
say
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
introduction
to
the
craft
beer
world
from
one
of
the
finest
craft
brewers
in
the
world
this
is
a
great
start
cant
go
wrong
i
will
have
again
im
not
thrilled
its
just
ok
i
don
think
ill
get
any
more
i
find
the
watery
lightness
is
not
completely
compensated
by
the
sparkle
theres
a
bit
too
much
grain
bitterness
for
my
taste
a
larger
proportion
of
a
lighter
carmel
grain
would
help
remove
some
of
the
grain
bitterness
boost
the
alcohol
and
add
some
body
overall
a
nice
amber
ale
for
the
hop
heads
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
was
hoping
that
this
beer
at
a
4
4
abv
could
offer
significant
flavor
and
be
a
highly
drinkable
beer
while
keeping
that
low
alcohol
levelsomething
that
today
beers
seem
to
be
having
trouble
doing
as
the
only
flavorful
beers
are
rising
in
abv
this
offers
a
good
smattering
of
flavors
with
some
uumph
from
the
hops
and
malt
flavors
that
dont
back
down
but
its
not
nearly
as
flavorful
as
i
hoped
worse
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
overall
the
beer
lacks
a
solid
body
and
distinctive
flavors
it
would
have
been
nice
to
find
a
fairly
low
abv
beer
out
there
that
offers
what
the
higher
abv
beers
bring
to
the
table
but
this
one
doesnt
othis
is
a
pretty
great
sessiontype
beer
i
really
mean
it
when
i
say
it
drinks
like
an
approachable
bastard
because
the
hop
profile
is
so
similar
to
arrogant
b
albeit
a
bit
toned
down
in
this
format
i
also
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
manages
to
drink
well
while
providing
some
substance
on
the
palate
mouth
dry
and
evenly
carbonated
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
could
maybe
use
a
little
more
body
to
make
up
for
the
acidity
of
the
hops
its
only

which
is
is
not
typical
of
amber

expected
from
stone
though
other
notes
of
deep
caramel
molasses
sugar
metallic
notes
and
syrupy
maple
overall
im
typically
not
a
fan
of
amber
ales
but
this
is
hopped
up
to
my
tastes
its
very
enjoyable
this
ones
a
mixed
bag
while
its
low
abv
makes
it
a
great
session
ale
it
also
hinders
it
in
the
amber
field
the
aroma
seems
to
be
the
strongest
aspect
of
this
one
with
its
ipa
like
hop
smells
theres
better
ambers
out
much
better
this
brew
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
pretty
sad
off
white
head
almost
no
lacing
on
my
glass
it
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
some
nice
piney
hops
there
is
a
very
pleasant
aroma
to
this
brew
i
found
the
taste
to
be
quite
malty
but
it
has
some
definite
hop
bitterness
that
balances
it
out
nicely
this
beer
is
not
yellow
its
not
fizzy
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
water
but
it
clocks
in
at
a
measly
4
4
abv
this
is
good
and
im
happy
drinking
but
i
would
just
step
it
up
to
the
ipa
overall
good
session
beer
but
way
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
i
try
to
not
let
my
wallet
influence
reviews
but
when
im
paying
what
this
costs
i
would
prefer
to
be
satisfied
with
one
beer
i
would
have
this
around
often
if
it
was
more
affordable
but
still
it
is
overall
a
very
good
brew
o
a
good
session
amber
better
cold
overall
an
amber
ale
for
the
hop
head
stone
hits
a
home
run
with
this
one
in
my
opinion
regardless
i
would
have
it
again
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
it
where
you
are
oits
a
good
but
not
great
amber
id
like
more
depth
overall
a
very
solid

a

if
ever
there
was
one
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
pinecones
and
a
hint
of
oak
taste
begins
with
a
sharp
grapefruit
peel
bite
then
some
rye
bread
and
finishes
with
a
long
piney
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
an
excellent
amber
ale
it
is
really
a
nice
beer
for
hopheads
it
is
as
hoppy
as
some
of
the
new
session
ipas
ive
had
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
very
good
session
beer
not
the
strongest
flavors
in
the
world
but
excellent
for
what
it
is
pours
a
pretty
dark
amber
color
with
a
1finger
tan
head
the
head
doesnt
last
long
and
settles
down
to
a
very
small
head
mostly
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
leaves
lots
of
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
hoppy
grains
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
hint
of
some
dark
fruit
a
bitter
aftertaste
hits
you
right
up
front
from
the
hops
does
linger
around
until
the
next
sip
lol
roast
beef
and
potatoes
would
make
a
good
food
pairing
with
this
beer
oi
enjoy
the
beer
but
it
isnt
a
great
representation
of
the
style
too
hoppy
and
not
nuanced
enough
imo
session
character
levitation
clocks
in
at

hurrah
thanks
to
stone
no
stranger
in
the
hoppy

movement
for
producing
a

with
this

while
being
so

very

a
great
hoppy
fix
with
big

and
all
wrapped
in

this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
often
underestimate
just
how
good
it
is
great

loaded

that
i

to

o
not

ive
had
but
definitely
not
a
drain
pour
cheers
cons
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
to
the
beers
flavor
o
its
very
good
but
its
not
exactly
what
it
appears
to
be
in
terms
of
style
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
are
its
only
real
differences
from
ipas
that
ive
had
overall
a
really
good
beer
one
of
the
most
flavorful
ales
ive
had
overall
solid
beer
i
wasnt
even
sure
what
style
of
beer
this
was
supposed
to
be
but
as
i
was
expecting
something
lighter
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
definitely
worth
a
try
appearance
was
a
nice
orangelight
amber
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
lacing
smell
is
very
hoppy
up
front
but
not
so
strong
in
the
taste
taste
was
hoppy
but
with
a
nice
malty
and
bready
aftertaste
sits
well
very
drinkable
and
has
become
one
of
my
favourites
to
session
and
from
stone
in
general
o
its
not
bad
but
its
predicatable
and
therefore
boring
im
going
to
buy
a
case
next
time
and
i
will
try
to
update
one
interesting
note
is
the
modest
abv
the
beer
tastes
strong
and
powerful
but
with
a
listed
abv
of
4
4
it
is
a
step
back
from
the
610
brews
that
fill
the
rest
of
my
fridge
a
strong
beer
would
fit
this
drink
well
but
the
levitation
ale
sits
right
its
the
perfect
midafternoon
drink
o
great
flavor
profile
here
obviously
sessionable
i
always
love
going
back
to
this
one
bought
a
sixpack
at
table
and
vine
in
west
springfield
ma
beer
poured
with
a
nice
amber
appearance
with
medium
retention
and
decent
lacing
aromas
had
an
initial
hint
of
caramel
and
malts
while
subsequent
breaths
brought
up
smells
of
wood
and
bread
flavors
definitely
highlighted
the
bread
with
some
malt
and
sweet
citrus
great
mouthfeel
really
liked
the
carbonation
which
helped
make
the
drink
really
refreshing
to
drink
a
very
great
beer
and
a
pleasure
for
the
evening
overall
this
is
a
good
well
balanced
ale
a
hop
forward
red
ale
with
a
malt
backbone
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
o
levitation
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
amber
ales
are
my
favorite
this
looks
so
pretty
in
the
glass
i
should
note
the
bottle
i
drank
from
had
an
enjoy
by
date
of
about
two
weeks
past
but
it
didnt
matter
i
still
found
it
delicious
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
with
this
beer
everything
is
pretty
good
except
the
taste
maybe
this
one
isnt
fresh
but
i
have
never
had
a
problem
with
that
from
this
store
may
have
to
try
again
another
day
but
this
is
what
i
got
for
now
o
very
good
beer
to
me
this
is
something
i
probably
wouldnt
have
seen
if
it
wasnt
for
my
trained
eye
its
a
low
abv
but
leaves
room
for
a
lot
of
quality
and
flavor
i
would
suggest
getting
this
if
you
see
it
before
its
gone
overall
the
happiest
amberred
ive
ever
had
the
low
abv
helps
make
this
an
okay
session
one
of
stone
brewings
most
sessionable
beers
only
4
4
but
in
no
way
does
stone
relinquish
their
intense
flavor
pours
a
dark
red
copper
with
good
retention
for
a
red
ale
they
use
a
lot
of
hops
but
i
really
appreciate
it
its
a
pretty
complex
beer
good
combination
of
both
malt
and
hop
has
a
slight
oily
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
brew
with
high
drinkability
because
of
the
low
abv
and
the
amazing
taste
o
screams
quality
in
its
look
and
smell
and
the
lingering
bitterness
grows
more
interesting
the
low
abv
makes
it
eminently
sessionable
and
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
this
could
be
a
real
welcome
winner
as
it
was
for
me
o
overall
one
of
the
best
hoppy
red
ales
ive
ever
tasted
i
like
it
better
that
green
flash
hop
head
red
definitely
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
i
can
see
the
appeal
its
a
very
good
session
beer
another
solid
offering
from
stone
o
not
enough
malt
for
what
i
am
normally
looking
for
in
an
amber
though
what
you
would
expect
from
a
stone
beer
nice
aroma
but
needs
more
in
the
flavor
profile
if
i
was
looking
for
an
ipa
i
would
judt
get
one
of
their
other
options
o
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
its
very
light
refreshing
and
tasty
a
lot
of
my
enjoyment
came
from
the
aroma
alone
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
get
tired
of
them
i
would
have
maybe
liked
to
see
a
tad
bit
more
maltiness
or
something
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
pretty
flavorful
beer
but
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
those
who
like
hops
as
the
low
abv
means
you
could
drink
several
easily
o
fair
to
middling
ipa
disguised
as
a
red
ale
kinda
grows
on
you
as
you
get
to
the
tail
end
of
the
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
again
it
doesnt
seem
to
know
what
kind
of
beer
it
is
aroma
is
piney
hops
citrus
malts
and
mild
fruit
flavor
is
citrus
grapefruit
biscuitearthy
malts
fruit
and
a
tangybitter
finish
among
the
best
session
ales
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
great
every
day
ale
and
even
with
the
low
abv
its
the
best
amber
ale
ive
every
had
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
unique
and
classic
overall
a
delicious
session
ale
i
can
think
of
very
few
beers
less
than
5abv
that
can
stand
up
to
the
intensity
of
flavor
and
balance
of
this
beer
o
not
my
favorite
stone
brew
but
its
still
a
very
good
beer
a
perfect
beer
for
anyone
who
likes
the
taste
of
hops
but
doesnt
enjoy
the
bitterness
and
explosion
of
a
ton
of
hops
i
do
enjoy
beers
like
that
but
there
are
times
when
i
want
a
lighter
more
crisp
tasting
hoppy
beer
and
this
beer
does
the
trick
highly
recommended
this
beer
has
a
lighter
abv
than
any
beer
ive
had
from
stone
but
it
still
packs
a
flavor
punch
a
good
summer
offering
in
my
opinion
even
with
its
thicker
body
o
a
refreshing
red
ale
low
abv
but
high
in
flavor
very
hard
to
believe
this
is
4
4
abv
very
tasty
and
filling
this
a
perfect
session
beer
for
any
time
of
year
o
a
well
done
hoppy
amber
low
abv
makes
this
one
of
the
more
favorable
sessions
ive
had
not
quite
as
bold
as
most
from
the
stone
line
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
gruff
earthy
hops
and
crisp
orange
and
toast
notes
roasty
actually
with
bitter
pith
and
flavorful
pine
woodiness
so
smooth
and
wonderful
in
the
mouth
chewy
with
a
presence
of
dextrins
but
light
enough
to
never
coat
and
always
deliver
with
that
spiky
carb
and
gentle
hop
oiliness
on
the
tongue
american
hop
heaven
for
a
lighter
early
evening
opener
magically
drinkable
exceptional
stuff
certainly
deserving
of
all
the
accolades
flavors
of
bitter
hops
grapefruit
rind
persimmon
grassy
hops
white
pepper
despite
the
relatively
low
abv
this
brew
has
significant
flavor
and
punch
a
respectable
hoppy
session
brew
dig
this
brew
its
not
going
to
impress
anyone
at
a
beerdrinkers
hipster
party
just
a
solid
drinkable
beer
for
a
session
o
this
was
pretty
tasty
more
hop
forward
than
i
was
expecting
which
was
nice
the
only
place
it
fell
short
was
in
the
mouth
feel
which
i
cant
ding
it
to
much
being
such
a
low
abv
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
and
not
get
too
hammered
there
is
nothing
unique
or
exciting
about
this
beer
but
dang
if
i
didnt
enjoy
it
it
poured
up
a
deep
ambercopper
color
with
a
small
head
not
a
lot
of
lacing
but
decent
retention
the
smell
is
very
pine
floral
bready
citrusy
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
nose
citrus
is
the
predominant
flavor
and
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
savor
and
enjoy
it
its
sort
of
like
a
snpa
its
hardly
thr
greatest
beer
ever
brewed
but
it
sure
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
nicely
drinkable
with
a
good
balance
worth
picking
up
when
you
just
want
something
easy
with
enough
flavor
to
be
worth
drinking
great
for
an
afterwork
and
unwind
beer
overall
just
another
stone
bitter
hoppy
greatlooking
beer
the
taste
is
notable
if
not
my
preferred
style
but
not
one
i
want
to
continue
on
with
not
bad
but
not
my
preference
still
want
to
visit
the
brewery
though
a
lot
of
ales
ive
had
have
that
hoppy
bite
which
is
good
but
this
levitation
ale
from
stone
is
just
smooth
and
drinkable
and
somehow
full
flavored
it
has
great
color
and
a
nice
smell
smells
like
a
good
ale
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
bite
that
a
lot
of
stones
beers
have
but
sometimes
you
dont
need
to
be
drop
kicked
in
the
face
i
like
this
beer
a
good
bit
a
good
drink
overall
didnt
blow
me
away
by
any
means
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
sure
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
but
definitely
an
overall
enjoyable
experience
3
75
overall
a
greatly
enjoyed
american
amber
ale
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
chugging
a
bunch
of
these
or
return
for
many
times
but
it
definitely
is
a
good
example
of
a
resiny
amber
ointeresting
take
on
the
style
very
drinkable
and
great
flavor
perhaps
a
bit
hoppier
than
many
other
redamber
ales
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
more
malt
presence
not
bad
a
lot
of
hop
bittering
action
in
the
tiny
4
4
overall
i
like
it
but
im
left
wanting
more
levitation
ale
is
pretty
much
the
lightest
beer
stone
offers
and
is
a
great
light
beer
its
probably
still
on
the
stronger
end
of
the
spectrum
of
american
ambers
which
is
to
be
expected
from
stone
ive
only
had
this
once
because
its
difficult
to
find
in
my
area
the
beer
pours
a
light
caramel
red
the
body
is
incredibly
clear
and
free
of
sediment
and
the
head
of
the
beer
is
light
and
soapy
white
but
bubbles
away
quickly
to
leave
a
light
scrim
and
some
thin
wavy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
smells
terrifically
big
and
bitter
with
gushes
of
pine
citrus
and
a
light
note
of
juicy
mango
mingling
with
the
candy
caramel
malts
beneath
the
hops
it
smells
tremendously
hoppy
for
a
4
4
amber
ale
which
is
what
stone
bills
it
as
personally
thought
i
see
this
beer
as
a
sessionable
ipa
with
a
darker
body
stone
calls
it
an
amber
ale
though
and
honestly
style
doesnt
really
matter
there
is
a
nice
resiny
touch
to
the
smell
of
the
beer
when
agitated
which
further
marks
this
beer
as
an
ipa
to
me
on
the
palate
this
beer
continues
the
ipa
trend
the
beer
begins
with
light
bitter
pine
before
opening
into
big
bitter
citrus
with
a
sweet
caramel
traveling
beneath
the
hops
and
balancing
this
beer
beautifully
for
all
its
bitter
flavor
this
is
a
lighter
beer
that
finds
a
beautiful
balance
with
the
light
alcohol
and
malts
keeping
the
hops
to
a
comfortable
and
thirst
quenching
bitter
bite
and
enough
flavor
for
you
to
compete
with
beers
far
bigger
than
it
the
finish
of
the
beer
is
bitter
and
full
of
hints
of
grapefruit
and
light
cereal
malts
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
nice
little
fizzle
from
the
carbonation
which
smoothes
the
beer
onto
the
tongue
leaving
the
mouth
with
a
very
thin
sheen
of
cool
spittle
and
a
light
dry
bitter
lingering
in
the
mouth
it
is
actually
quite
refreshing
in
feeling
which
may
stem
from
its
lower
alcohol
percentage
overall
this
is
a
superb
beer
its
hugely
hoppy
yet
balanced
yet
completely
sessionable
stone
has
really
done
something
neat
with
this
beer
and
i
really
hope
that
others
continue
to
follow
suit
because
this
is
something
i
could
sip
all
day
and
it
would
not
make
me
fall
over
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
session
beer
for
the
hop
heads
and
a
delicious
success
for
stone
it
is
a
little
too
hopforward
for
me
to
consider
it
an
amberred
ale
but
really
thats
just
semantics
the
beer
is
good
drink
it
dark
reddish
amber
in
color
not
alot
of
head
recedes
rather
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
very
nice
aroma
very
hoppy
citrus
and
pine
resin
the
taste
is
very
mild
and
leans
more
toward
the
hoppy
side
for
an
amber
ale
light
bodied
with
a
bitter
somewhat
roasty
finish
a
bit
unbalanced
i
think
as
the
bitterness
is
a
little
dominant
and
i
dont
pick
up
any
malt
sweetness
at
all
still
very
drinkable
and
a
good
session
option
for
sure
o
this
beer
gets
worse
the
more
you
get
into
it
it
looks
great
smells
pretty
good
tastes
weird
and
goes
down
like
water
very
disappointing
i
get
that
stone
was
trying
something
different
by
making
a
light
lowabv
session
brew
loaded
up
with
hops
but
it
just
doesnt
work
that
well
and
its
certainly
impossible
to
imagine
drinking
a
lot
of
these
in
a
session
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
medium
to
low
levels
of
carbonation
the
beer
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
without
suffering
the
resultant
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
crisp
somewhat
smooth
closes
dryly
overall
i
kind
of
like
this
beer
especially
since
it
has
a
low
abv
and
has
some
nice
hop
flavors
i
wish
it
was
thicker
its
basically
a
light
ipa
garbage
hot
trash
red
lobster
dumpster
garlic
onion
just
garbage
reviewed
from
notes
bottle
to
pint
glass
pours
a
rich
dark
amber
with
half
a
finger
of
foam
poor
retention
moderate
lacing
smell
of
hops
citrus
caramel
and
a
biscuit
malt
tastes
of
hops
brown
nut
and
caramel
malt
thick
body
very
chewey
overall
its
not
too
bad
pours
red
but
taste
is
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
not
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
though
unless
im
looking
for
a
session
ale
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
much
of
this
final
thoughts
its
nice
that
stone
released
with
low
abv
beer
and
they
definitely
prove
the
point
that
light
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
light
on
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
possibly
on
tap
during
a
session
o
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
friends
mark
this
a
one
of
there
goto
session
suds
im
hesitant
to
do
so
so
quickly
i
am
impressed
with
the
amount
of
flavor
packed
into
such
a
low
abv
brew
though
o
i
like
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
but
i
think
the
intent
of
this
beer
was
missed
the
low
malt
backbone
makes
the
hop
flavor
and
slight
roast
flavors
so
high
that
it
makes
the
beer
fairly
unsessionable
and
to
me
right
now
borderline
undrinkable
overall
again
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
reds
but
this
one
is
ok
credit
were
due
for
a
good
beer
poured
this
red
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
amber
color
produced
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
toasted
malt
and
earthy
hops
medium
in
body
this
ale
has
a
foundation
of
fresh
baked
bread
roasted
malt
citrus
and
piney
hop
flavor
overall
a
nice
example
of
this
style
well
balanced
great
session
beer
this
is
the
most
flavor
you
can
possibly
get
into
a
beer
under
5
abv
im
convinced
it
pours
clear
dark
amber
in
color
surprisingly
dark
after
a
swig
from
the
bottle
theres
a
fluffy
lazy
white
head
patiently
fading
smell
is
red
malts
without
the
sugar
fresh
resiny
hops
some
grapefruit
lots
of
hops
for
a
red
flavor
is
balanced
amazingly
malt
flavors
and
aromas
first
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
almost
fresh
from
the
vine
hops
really
pungent
dank
and
yummy
some
copper
in
the
aftertaste
minerally
long
lasting
theres
great
carbonation
feels
likghter
than
it
really
it
this
is
one
of
the
better
session
beers
ive
had
a
10
dollar
6pack
is
a
perfect
monday
night
football
pick
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
one
theres
nothing
particularly
captivating
about
the
anything
here
if
you
want
a
session
beer
thats
an
amber
ale
you
could
choose
far
worse
brews
in
both
the
craft
and
macro
worlds
than
levitation
you
can
also
do
much
better
oone
of
my
least
favorite
stones
that
says
a
lot
about
the
brewery
but
not
too
much
about
the
beer
owas
expecting
more
from
stone
with
red
ales
such
as
nugget
nectar
and
red
rye
pa
from
founders
there
are
better
examples
out
there
a
good
amber
ale
for
hopheads
with
low
alcoholic
content
but
high
flavor
atmosphere
is
good
nice
appearance
including
a
frothy
head
and
some
really
nice
lacing
nose
is
bitter
and
sweet
flavor
is
a
great
combination
of
numerous
very
light
components
very
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
once
again
stone
brewery
comes
through
this
is
an
ale
i
place
a
step
above
their
i
p
a
such
a
complex
body
and
nose
incredibly
hoppy
with
such
an
amazing
taste
i
love
to
just
sit
and
sip
on
this
enjoyable
brew
on
the
strong
side
if
youre
not
into
a
beer
with
hoppier
taste
but
i
can
promise
you
that
this
is
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
out
of
the
stone
brewery
a
must
have
o
tasty
brew
a
little
mild
for
my
liking
in
a
lot
of
ways
but
incredibly
well
balanced
o
this
one
gets
a
lot
of
talk
as
one
of
the
best
session
beers
out
there
the
reputation
is
well
deserved
unique
and
full
flavored
while
staying
light
and
mellow
great
when
you
want
to
have
a
beer
or
twelve
impressive
beer
for
what
it
is
definitely
sessionable
low
abv
but
excellent
flavor
for
this
category
the
deeper
flavor
reminds
of
some
of
the
english
pale
ales
yet
low
abv
definite
hop
flavor
but
they
are
mild
and
very
dry
this
beer
is
not
new
at
least
a
year
old
yet
the
flavor
is
still
good
brown
to
amber
color
in
the
glass
o
a
very
good
straight
ahead
beer
the
balance
is
perfect
and
at
an
incredibly
low
abv
a
perfect
session
beer
overall
when
you
want
a
quality
well
crafted
beer
with
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
levitation
should
be
near
the
top
of
your
list
pours
an
inviting
hazelnut
with
some
light
tan
foam
etching
the
surface
nose
pulls
give
me
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
zests
light
malts
hints
of
cola
and
tea
flavor
is
yummy
english
like
malts
and
plenty
of
citrusy
hops
the
citrus
cannot
be
understated
in
this
one
for
me
its
really
on
the
back
end
when
i
breath
nice
orange
rinds
with
some
hints
of
grapefruit
the
malts
are
pekoe
in
character
the
beer
is
carried
in
a
medium
weight
with
lively
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
beer
really
drinkable
and
i
wish
stone
would
can
this
one
o
good
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
worth
checking
out
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
has
a
nice
flavor
all
around
i
enjoy
it
o
a
good
offering
but
at
the
pricepoint
10
6pack
for
a
4
4
abv
beer
that
seems
a
little
excessive
if
the
price
was
paired
down
to
68
a
6er
than
id
be
singing
and
slinging
its
praises
for
a
wonderful
yearround
session
beer
o
very
impressive
for
a
low
abv
session
beer
would
definitely
try
again
o
a
great
beer
just
on
the
hopheavy
side
of
balanced
o
dissappointing
overall
i
wanted
to
like
this
given
the
look
and
low
abv
but
it
just
doesnt
deliver
has
that
strange
bitter
hopsweet
taste
i
just
cant
get
into
not
a
drain
pour
but
i
wont
be
buying
or
drinking
this
again
soon
more
interesting
then
a
macro
light
lager
but
at
3x
the
price
and
the
same
abv
ill
take
a
bud
light
o
every
time
i
head
to
buffalo
i
see
this
and
check
the
date
i
bought
this
in
early
july
and
the
bb
date
is
the
freshest
ive
ever
seen
for
this
so
i
took
a
chance
id
love
to
try
it
fresher
but
being
in
canada
and
relying
solely
on
buffalo
stores
i
think
this
is
good
as
its
going
to
get
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
hazy
red
with
a
bubbly
white
head
the
smell
is
light
floral
hops
very
nice
its
very
carbonated
a
little
too
much
the
hops
are
in
front
in
the
taste
just
like
in
the
smell
definitely
bitter
i
guess
i
shouldnt
expect
any
less
from
stone
considering
their
other
offerings
i
was
expecting
a
little
maltiness
since
this
is
an
amber
ale
but
i
cant
pick
out
anything
over
the
hops
its
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
a
nice
feat
considering
the
hoppacked
flavor

a
nice
session
beer
i
would
not
pass
this
up
by
far
one
of
my
top
beer
very
hoppy
but
has
a
great

balance
seems
like
a
lighter
ipa
if
your
not
quite
ready
for
ipas
yet
this
is
where
you
should
start
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
has
a
high
drinkablilty
i
could
definitely
use
this
as
a
session
beer
it
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
i
will
still
pass
until
i
see
it
crazy
fresh
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
wellbalanced
like
a
good
amber
ale
should
be
but
its
somewhat
confusing
because
the
nose
was
more
hopheavy
while
the
taste
was
more
maltheavy
its
also
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
in
terms
of
body
but
that
kind
of
makes
sense
considering
the
low
abv
despite
these
characteristics
this
is
a
really
nice
session
beer
stone
never
disappoints
this
style
is
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
this
time
it
definitely
was
a
miss
i
did
not
find
this
beer
enjoyable
or
flavorful
but
that
doesnt
mean
im
ready
to
turn
in
my
stone
fan
club
pin
just
yet
this
brewer
has
several
outstanding
beers
in
my
opinion
this
isnt
one
of
them
presentation
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
for
an
amber
ale
that
defies
tradition
and
tastes
like
an

it
is
a
low
key
tasting
beer
that
doesnt
overpower
yet
keeps
its
flavor
throughout

while
only
at

an
enjoyable
ale
but
unbalanced
definitely
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
hops
scale
for
my
taste
buds
overall
for
the
strength
of
this
brew
is
sure
packs
in
plenty
of
flavor
maybe
a
little
too
expensive
to
be
a
regular
session
brew
but
it
is
great
on
occasion
odoverall
a
pretty
solid
amber
well
hopped
but
excellently
balanced
not
my
favorite
stone
brew
but
its
damn
tasty
the
most
of
the
other
regularly
available
brews
o
a
good
but
not
great
amber
ale
id
certainly
have
it
again
if
offered
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
vs
others
such
as
nb
fat
tire
this
beer
won
the
2007
gold
medal
winner
in
the
great
american
beer
festival
it
has
solid
taste
and
great
feel
easy
drinkable
but
as
the
warmer
weather
comes
it
is
not
my
preference
in
the
past
i
have
never
been
a
fan
of
stone
brews
but
this
one
definitely
changed
my
mind
about
the
quality
of
brews
from
this
brewery
like
most
great
beer
this
beer
has
great
head
i
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
and
it
poured
with
ease
it
is
definitely
a
beer
i
will
buy
more
of
o
good
variant
of
an
amber
that
stands
on
its
own
id
have
it
again
just
another
solid
brew
from
the
folks
at
stone
overall
another
solid
beer
from
stone
maybe
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
imagine
this
pairing
well
w
a
good
stinky
cheese
or
a
burger
and
4
4
abv
great
session
beer
one
more
please
pours
a
translucent
dark
amber
with
no
head
the
bouquet
is
very
nice
with
tart
citrus
cabbage
and
pine
the
flavor
is
vibrant
but
has
that
signature
stone
overwhelming
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
adversely
impacted
by
the
intrusive
hop
presence
ive
had
a
lot
of
stone
but
the
only
one
ive
found
to
be
good
is
sublimely
selfrighteous
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
slightly
hazy
amber
with
an
eggshell
colored
twofinger
length
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
as
well
as
a
light
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
piney
hops
is
strong
there
are
also
citrus
and
malt
aromas
as
well
its
a
very
earthy
smell
the
big
hop
flavors
hit
up
front
to
perfectly
support
the
mild
malt
flavors
the
citrus
and
sweetness
are
subdued
but
present
its
incredibly
well
balanced
there
is
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
the
body
to
this
beer
is
actually
surprisingly
quite
light
though
it
would
be
more
light
to
medium
the
carbonation
is
not
strong
but
this
beer
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
stone
its
a
sessionable
hop
forward
ale
o
a
very
sessionable
stoner
one
i
will
require
more
of
levitate
me
little
gargoyle
o
while
it
is
light
bodied
thats
the
point
and
for
that
it
has
great
flavor
i
really
appreciate
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
this
is
a
great
job
and
would
be
the
perfect
session
beer
flavorful
enough
not
to
be
boring
light
enough
to
have
pint
after
pint
o
hop
water
with
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
body
feels
more
like
water
as
drinking
at
room
temperature
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
good
size
white
head
that
leaves
sporadic
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
citrus
pine
and
fruits
taste
is
malt
sweetness
followed
by
citrus
earthy
and
piny
hops
and
a
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
with
easy
drinkability
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
chestnut
color
with
dark
golden
orange
hues
white
foamy
head
that
forms
a
ring
within
a
few
minutes
aroma
of
bitter
pine
hops
and
citrus
taste
is
pine
and
citrus
followed
closely
with
a
touch
of
maltiness
medium
bodied
and
easy
drinking
still
a
solid
drink
id
like
to
call
this
the
young
bastard
o
hoppier
than
a
typical
amber
ale
but
a
well
balanced
deviation
overall
a
fairly
good
red
ale
offering
from
stone
reminds
me
a
bit
of
red
tail
ale
though
not
quite
as
sweet
or
astringent
and
better
rounded
the
low
4
4
is
a
bit
surprising
considering
the
brewery
known
for
aggressive
high
abv
beers
this
is
a
nice
changeup
that
finds
its
way
for
a
strike
o
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
for
the
4
4
abv
its
very
hoppy
and
delicious
an
amber
ale
that
reminds
you
of
a
hoppy
pale
ale
at
4
4
very
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
fantasizing
about
sessioning
this
and
founders
all
day
sidebyside
dark
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
and
moderate
lacing
big
citrus
hops
in
the
aroma
flavor
was
citrus
hops
with
hints
of
pink
grapefruit
a
little
malt
in
the
background
but
a
good
hop
finish
just
a
little
thin
flatness
in
the
finish
overall
good
amber
this
is
a
great
beer
with
excellent
flavors
and
aromas
to
entertain
the
senses
without
the
higher
abv
associated
with
similarly
flavored
beers
making
it
great
for
sessions
not
bad
pretty
tasty
with
stacks
of
hops
as
expected
mouthfeel
would
have
benefited
from
higher
carbonation
a
good
blend
of
malt
and
aromatic
hops
though
the
bitterness
is
perhaps
over
the
top
decent
but
not
as
good
as
other
stone
offerings
try
it
once
overall
the
beer
is
above
average
but
it
is
not
a
staple
in
my
beer
diet
there
are
better
beers
that
come
from
the
stone
brewery
although
this
one
is
not
bad
overall
i
dont
know
if
id
get
this
again
i
like
a
brew
with
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
nonetheless
its
pretty
awesome
given
4
4
abv
a
session
beer
if
ever
there
was
one
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
wine
glass
best
by
5112
this
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
which
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smells
are
of
good
and
caramel
other
malts
pretty
good
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
mouth
coating
hop
resin
the
taste
is
good
nice
mid
hop
bite
with
a
caramel
backbone
i
really
wish
they
had
these
in
texas
because
this
would
be
my
go
to
session
beer
not
my
favorite
style
usually
but
this
is
a
nice
amber
ale
that
i
enjoyed
its
the
coolest
session
ale
ive
ever
had
doa
overall
55
i
feel
it
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
because
its
a
session
beer
that
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
looks
like
a
red
overall
impression
after
enjoying
the
tornado
alley
i
wanted
to
compare
to
one
i
havent
had
from
stone
yet
not
much
different
had
quite
a
bit
of
hop
character
and
smoother
finish
than
charlevilles
brew
but
would
definitely
hit
others
from
stone
before
this
one
will
give
it
a
good
overall
rating
because
it
hit
most
of
the
categories
i
had
this
on
tap
at
rattle
and
hum
fairly
dark
for
an
amber
ale
the
head
was
about
1
finger
i
was
surprised
by
two
things
the
large
amount
of
hops
and
the
low
abv
also
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
not
the
best
that
stone
has
to
offer
but
certainly
a
nice
session
beer
that
is
not
very
representative
of
the
style
decently
tasty
brew
from
stone
but
this
one
really
stands
out
as
being
a
nice
sessionable
lowabv
beer
while
still
boasting
a
ton
of
flavor
certainly
atypical
for
the
brewery
but
thats
perhaps
part
of
its
popularity
extremely
quaffable
and
good
enough
to
warrant
throwing
back
a
couple
from
time
to
time
o
starts
slow
but
gets
better
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
glad
i
lucked
into
this
one
this
beer
was
great
easily
one
of
my
top
5
for
flavor
and
drinkability
this
is
definitely
going
to
be
a
regular
in
my
arsenal
from
now
on
i
love
the
excellent
quality
of
this
beer
compared
to
beers
with
a
comparable
abv
i
suggest
this
to
anyone
wanting
to
broaden
out
to
bolder
more
adventurous
beers
because
it
is
a
tame
stroll
into
the
depths
of
stone
beers
which
i
have
found
all
to
be
good
to
date
in
my
experiences
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nose
the
hoppiness
was
excellent
with
fruit
and
sweetness
to
make
is
nicely
inviting
we
must
have
fallen
off
the
trail
somewhere
between
the
nose
and
the
mouth
the
flavors
were
flat
throughout
and
the
heavy
bitterness
made
the
taste
seem
detached
from
what
was
set
up
for
by
the
aroma
additionally
there
was
a
flattish
feel
to
the
palate
leaving
not
only
the
taste
buds
board
but
the
mouth
bored
as
well
opretty
nice
to
sip
on
for
a
bit
not
to
strong
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
one
of
the
only
stone
beers
ive
tried
that
i
can
safely
say
i
will
not
be
likely
to
purchase
again
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
to
it
good
carbonation
clean
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
while
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
still
a
very
good
beer
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
but
in
all
well
done
hoppier
than
i
expect
an
amber
to
be
o
a
very
drinkable
amber
ale
a
12
ounce
bottle
of
levitation
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
color
leaving
quick
light
foam
that
lingers
on
the
surface
alongside
an
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
hoppy
strawlike
scent
and
a
taste
that
is
punchy
but
fleeting
it
is
full
of
hops
offering
little
to
counter
yet
it
is
not
obtrusive
nor
insistent
a
mouthful
is
fizzy
but
dissipates
quickly
this
is
pretty
much
the
entry
level
brew
from
stone
brewery
but
like
most
of
their
other
entries
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
its
nothing
to
put
on
your
wants
list
or
go
way
out
of
your
way
to
try
and
find
but
it
is
certainly
deserving
of
a
pint
or
two
i
would
serve
it
to
my
guests
for
what
its
worth
but
it
didnt
blow
my
hair
back
light
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
a
very
solid
sessionable
brew
on
tap
at
stones
public
house
in
ashland
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
light
orange
colored
body
barely
had
any
head
but
with
moderate
lacing
though
smell
had
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
taste
was
refreshingly
good
nice
level
of
hops
for
an
amber
enough
hops
to
notice
but
not
overly
hopped
like
some
west
coast
beers
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
balanced
dose
of
malt
to
give
it
some
body
i
guess
the
one
thing
that
surprised
me
was
the
low
abv
seeing
this
now
as
i
review
it
i
would
have
never
guessed
stone
made
this
beer
so
low
didnt
taste
like
a
session
beer
a
new
beer
for
me
when
i
am
looking
for
a
flavorful
yet
low
abv
choice
of
beer
overall
wasnt
sure
how
this
would
be
wow
was
i
blown
away
low
abv
yes
but
great
flavor
both
piney
hop
and
rich
caramel
malts
stone
comes
through
again
great
brew
overall
this
is
worth
trying
d
well
built
well
balanced
and
its
the
best
stone
brew
ive
had
12oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
amberorange
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
aroma
had
a
light
hop
nose
with
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
taste
was
mild
had
some
bitterness
with
some
caramel
and
roast
tones
alongside
a
dry
finish
overall
this
one
is
good
and
has
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
and
character
in
it
definitely
would
drink
again
great
brew
for
a
lighter
beer
would
go
as
far
as
calling
this
one
of
stones
most
balanced
beers
though
definitely
not
as
ridiculous
or
fascinating
as
others
they
have
released
the
fact
that
it
is
sessionable
makes
its
consumption
all
the
merrier
o
i
really
dig
stones
levitation
as
a
closet
session
fanatic
this
is
one
of
the
better
session
brews
on
the
market
i
have
and
will
continue
to
drink
this
tasty
little
amber
and
recommend
checking
it
out
for
yourself
the
most
enjoyable
redamber
ive
had
far
hoppier
than
most
almost
like
ripa
red
ipa
o
very
underwhelming
not
worth
noting
not
sure
i
can
recommend
this
one
nothing
sticks
out
dr
drinkable
and
refreshing
if
a
bit
fullbodied
not
sessionable
but
certainly
worth
a
go
for
any
beer
fanatic
i
do
wish
it
werent
so
coarse
from
family
beer
and
liquor
east
dubuque
il
nice
pour
with
huge
white
head
not
much
going
on
with
the
aroma
for
me
flavor
is
somewhat
hoppy
and
balanced
very
well
with
the
malts
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
low
abv
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
with
this
one
i
think
this
beer
may
be
one
of
the
best
introductory
beers
out
there
to
introduce
non
craft
drinkers
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
the
lower
alcohol
percentage
is
a
rarity
for
stone
and
i
dont
feel
they
skimp
on
the
taste
at
all
despite
it
being
the
alcohol
content
that
the
average
beer
consumer
would
be
used
to
its
hoppy
but
well
balanced
the
style
is
one
that
the
average
beer
consumer
has
probably
had
before
but
this
is
a
good
well
hopped
up
version
and
still
contains
all
the
signifying
traits
that
make
up
stone
great
for
a
session
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
beer
to
bring
the
average
consumer
and
a
craft
drinker
together
and
see
common
ground
i
see
it
as
being
a
big
success
for
that
reason
overall
behind
its
rather
intimidating
bottle
is
a
welcoming
ale
its
different
flavor
combined
with
its
smoothness
make
this
a
beer
thats
easy
to
recommend
for
pretty
much
anyone
rjt
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
amber
ale
opaque
dark
amber
in
color
delightful
hoppy
smell
and
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
accompany
a
heavy
meal
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
it
goes
down
easy
id
recommend
it
for
almost
any
beer
drinker
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
decently
drinkable
beer
goes
down
easy
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
it
has
a
dark
amber
color
body
with
a
nice
brown
color
head
that
lays
down
quickly
to
a
nice
lace
the
smell
is
of
floral
hops
with
some
pine
hints
the
taste
is
nice
of
hops
with
that
give
off
some
pine
notes
has
a
little
sweet
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
conclusion
this
beer
at
4
4
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
flavorful
and
you
can
finish
a
six
pack
without
toppling
over
totally
respectable
but
i
wish
the
price
was
lower
serving
type
bottle
overall
its
an
ok
beer
ive
never
been
huge
on
the
style
but
the
citrusy
hops
make
it
more
interesting
for
me
its
certainly
sessionable
with
the
low
abv
and
the
ibus
are
certainly
easily
managed
in
this
beer
anyway
it
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
bit
more
found
this
beer
to
surprisingly
be
a
bit
complex
a
sharp
hop
bite
that
quickly
moves
to
some
tasty
roasted
caramel
and
bready
malts
before
a
quick
dose
of
some
citrus
hops
that
really
brings
it
full
circle
gives
it
a
nice
bitter
finish
fullbodied
and
a
little
thick
and
fizzy
on
the
palate
this
beer
makes
me
think
more
of
a
wellbalanced
pale
ale
rather
than
an
amber
but
pretty
damn
good
nonetheless
do
drinkability
is
moderate
i
have
to
say
that
ontap
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
hoppier
beers
that
i
can
regularly
get
without
much
trouble
but
it
seems
to
lose
something
out
of
the
bottle
its
still
a
pretty
good
beer
and
it
still
have
about
a
week
to
go
until
its
best
by
date
yeah
not
the
freshest
but
its
better
than
it
being
well
past
and
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
transition
into
ipas
given
the
lower
abv
and
ibu
and
cleaner
feel
poured
into
standard
pint
levitation
is
a
deep
red
clear
ale
with
a
wispy
modest
creamy
head
lingering
on
top
earthy
citrusy
hops
hang
over
top
of
a
sweet
slightly
roasty
malt
aroma
a
taste
reveals
much
of
what
the
aroma
suggests
grapefruit
bitter
biting
citrus
hops
on
top
of
a
firm
malty
base
a
very
slight
roasted
malt
character
is
present
nice
mediumfull
body
for
a
lower
gravity
beer
with
moderate
carbonation
that
compliments
it
very
nicely
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
overall
and
seems
as
though
it
would
be
a
hopheads
session
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
the
bold
characteristics
of
a
big
hoppy
beer
but
keeps
it
in
control
with
a
lower
alcohol
content
very
nice
beer
if
you
like
hops
give
it
a
shot
color
is
dark
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
head
retention
is
outstanding
lasting
to
the
final
sip
and
theres
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
strong
citrus
hop
aromas
make
this
smell
like
an
ipa
from
the
scent
im
expecting
a
very
hoppy
taste
it
is
highly
hopped
relative
to
the
style
but
the
malt
character
comes
through
strongest
with
bread
and
caramel
flavors
there
is
a
nice
surge
of
piney
hops
in
the
finish
the
complex
flavors
all
balance
together
very
nicely
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
thin
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
very
very
drinkable
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
and
would
recommend
other
ambers
to
people
over
this
one
most
definitely
my
least
favorite
stone
to
date
o
in
just
a
few
words
this
is
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
put
this
in
12
packs
drop
the
price
and
make
this
the
goto
stone
beer
please
o
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
its
the
least
intense
and
probably
the
most
drinker
friendly
of
all
stones
beers
sure
to
not
dissapoint
but
dont
expect
anything
epic
overall
this
is
probably
the
most
hopped
an
amber
ale
will
ever
be
and
im
sure
stone
has
no
regrets
about
that
its
true
that
scores
are
not
going
to
be
mind
blowingly
high
on
this
amber
but
damn
is
it
a
good
easy
drinker
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
beer
dont
come
to
it
expecting
complexity
or
quirkiness
and
you
will
be
rewarded
the
hop
presence
is
enough
to
separate
it
from
other
amber
ales
but
not
powerful
enough
to
bring
it
out
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
at
4
4
its
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ive
had
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
for
a
six
pack
if
they
ever
make
a
12
pack
of
this
im
all
over
it
i
pretty
much
did
give
two
schlitz
for
this
bottle
of
levitation
i
dont
know
if
i
would
do
it
often
overall
this
is
a
solid
session
ale
from
stone
there
are
definitely
amber
ales
out
there
with
more
depth
and
complexity
but
you
cant
beat
levitations
drinkability
reminds
me
of
a
weak
surly
furious
highly
recommended
for
anyone
new
to
stone
or
craft
beer
in
general
cheers
stone
levitation
ale
is
a
very
good
amberred
ale
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
beer
got
docked
a
0
5pt
due
to
floaties
i
hate
floaties
i
even
cut
the
beer
off
early
the
color
is
a
nice
rich
red
with
good
offwhite
head
that
is
lacing
the
smell
includes
some
spice
and
bitter
citrus
the
taste
is
a
great
blend
of
malt
with
hops
that
cleans
and
tingle
the
pallate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
carbonation
and
good
balance
overall
it
is
decent
could
session
this
one
especially
with
the
lower
abv
o
at
times
this
thing
tastes
like
a
west
coast
ipa
really
impressive
beer
4
4
stone
respect
o
cant
ask
for
much
more
from
an
amber
on
this
one
stone
nails
it
balanced
with
just
enough
hops
overall
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
consider
it
a
rare
yet
appreciated
sessionable
offering
from
stone
i
enjoyed
it
with
pork
chops
and
stuffing
and
the
beer
complemented
the
meal
extremely
well
not
a
material
but
still
a
good
solid
enjoyable
beer
o
a
very
good
beer
for
such
a
low
alcohol
content
well
balanced
and
tasty
insanely
drinkable
quenchable
and
quaffable
this
is
an
insane
session
beer
one
of
the
most
flavoursome
and
exciting
beers
under
5
abv
i
think
ive
ever
had
and
despite
the
lightness
on
the
palate
it
never
feels
empty
great
brew
overall
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
than
i
did
it
just
didnt
marry
the
flavors
as
well
i
enjoy
sweetness
and
bitterness
but
you
get
each
separately
the
sweetness
upfront
and
then
the
bitterness
at
the
end
and
it
stays
with
you
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
my
favorite
i
am
quickly
becoming
a
fan
of
stone
first
of
all
im
not
sure
how
old
the
bottle
was
that
i
bought
if
it
still
has
the
great
american
beer
festival
gold
metal
winner
2007
on
the
neck
then
its
current
this
is
just
one
of
those
beautifully
rounded
malt
and
hops
push
and
pull
yen
and
yang
if
you
will
i
see
me
going
back
and
buying
more
to
age
a
little
and
try
more
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
didnt
get
to
try
it
now
since
my
area
is
prone
to
old
beer
and
this
one
was
finally
restocked
without
sediment
without
a
best
by
date
so
i
am
unsure
how
old
the
brew
is
but
it
was
still
mighty
tasty
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
it
would
improve
the
review
and
perspective
serving
type
bottle
certainly
enjoyable
i
finished
the
pint
without
a
problem
but
thought
the
hops
and
malt
flavors
clashed
though
it
says
something
when
stone
makes
a
balanced
beer
i
just
wished
it
meshed
better
for
me
pours
reddishbrown
with
at
least
a
finger
of
head
that
maintains
well
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
a
west
coast
pale
ale
some
citrus
and
nicely
hoppy
the
flavor
is
bold
for
a
beer
with
such
low
alcohol
it
has
a
pleasant
hop
finish
as
well
this
beer
is
a
gem
for
sessioning
with
craft
brew
friends
or
to
pair
with
everyday
meals
it
would
also
be
great
for
a
party
where
most
guests
were
not
craft
brew
enthusiasts
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
o
who
the
hell
knew
that
low
abv
beer
could
taste
this
great
im
astonished
i
think
i
might
pick
up
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
next
time
i
see
it
o
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
ive
had
with
such
a
low
abv
levitation
is
an
utterly
delightful
amber
ale
and
a
strong
contender
for
my
premier
goto
beer
a
perfect
example
that
drinkability
and
low
abv
dont
require
corn
in
a
can
this
beer
is
awesome
wow
this
is
one
light
abv
beer
packed
with
flavor
this
is
a
living
breathing
example
of
a
very
solid
sessionable
like
beer
happy
to
run
into
a
stone
take
over
at
deciccos
in
brewster
ny
this
brew
shows
a
dark
mahogany
color
semitranslucent
with
a
decent
tannish
froth
on
top
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
citrus
brightness
with
earthy
pine
and
subtle
flowery
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
bitter
raw
grass
and
subtle
pine
with
lots
of
biscuit
and
some
caramel
malt
its
peppery
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
fairly
aggressive
effervescent
feel
but
it
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
medium
light
bodied
at
best
medium
drinkability
decent
but
a
bit
harsh
for
the
style
all
and
all
excellent
beer
deep
reddish
gold
garnet
in
color
its
clear
and
has
a
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
leaving
lacing
on
the
glass
it
looks
stunning
ok
i
just
happen
to
love
this
color
aroma
of
grapefruit
hops
and
caramel
malt
flavor
similar
to
aroma
while
it
leans
toward
the
hoppy
side
it
has
a
nice
caramel
backbone
its
light
bodied
has
a
smooth
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
for
a
4
4
abv
brew
the
aptly
named
levitation
packs
in
a
lot
of
flavor
and
makes
for
a
very
sessionable
beer
overall
a
good
tasting
amber
that
is
low
enough
to
session
with
the
bmc
drinking
buddies
if
only
it
was
readily
available
it
would
be
my
go
to
beer
for
sure
overall
excellent
brew
another
great
one
from
stone
another
really
good
drinking
brew
from
stone
much
like
their
pale
ale
and
ipa
this
brew
falls
into
the
same
basic
catagory
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
colored
head
on
it
with
a
good
lacing
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
much
more
malty
than
most
stone
brew
that
im
aware
of
the
taste
of
the
brew
does
have
a
good
hoppiness
to
it
along
with
some
nice
caramel
flavors
too
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
overall
i
think
this
brew
is
pretty
damn
good
o
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
but
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
hopped
for
the
style
medium
body
and
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
exceptionally
drinkable
nice
flavor
a
solid
west
coast
take
on
the
amber
ale
i
think
next
time
i
would
not
get
the
six
pack
maybe
a
bomber
o
overall
pretty
good
i
feel
that
it
may
be
a
little
watery
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
but
quite
good
other
than
that
the
taste
is
a
little
light
but
its
still
pretty
good
o
didnt
really
think
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
smells
i
think
i
owe
it
to
myself
to
try
it
again
and
reevaluate
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
head
stuck
around
for
a
while
color
is
that
classic
amber
id
expect
clear
id
assume
filtered
smells
strongly
of
hops
and
an
earthy
malty
aroma
taste
is
really
good
for
the
style
and
abv
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
but
at
4
4
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
this
is
going
to
be
a
new
standard
hops
arent
as
strong
in
the
taste
as
the
smell
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
thats
expected
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
be
bringing
it
to
family
gettogethers
and
trying
to
convert
everyone
great
color
great
flavor
aggressive
but
not
overwhelming
bite
very
good
lacing
glassware
fresh
growler
into
snifter
overall
on
the
watery
side
of
red
ales
which
i
am
not
a
fan
off
despite
the
intensity
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
it
reminds
me
of
an
extra
pale
ale
since
the
hops
are
more
aggressive
than
most
amber
or
red
ales
i
have
tasted
pretty
amazing
stuff
here
o
looks
really
nice
and
smells
good
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
i
would
have
liked
more
malt
structure
a
well
constructed
and
well
balanced
beer
tasty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
i
guess
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
not
my
favourite
stone
brew
one
finger
light
tan
head
medium
dissipation
with
some
lacing
dark
amber
body
multiple
streams
of
carbonation
rising
up
side
of
glass
big
hop
aroma
especially
for
the
style
piney
goodness
balanced
by
caramel
malt
sweetness
taste
is
pretty
sweet
up
front
leading
to
a
quite
bitter
finish
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
good
effervescence
and
fairly
dry
finish
i
used
this
as
a
palate
awakener
and
while
the
patrons
who
dont
enjoy
fairly
hoppy
beers
were
in
flux
there
were
a
number
of
return
tasters
a
fairly
unique
amber
one
of
the
hoppier
examples
of
the
style
ala
troegs
at
this
abv
extremely
drinkable
worth
a
try
especially
for
those
looking
for
a
hoppy
session
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
notes
of
citrus
taste
is
very
hoppy
considerable
bitterness
i
am
not
tasting
any
of
the
citrus
in
the
smell
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
o
decent
second
time
i
have
tried
this
i
dont
believe
there
will
be
a
third
simply
not
my
favorite
from
stone
o
although
this
beer
isnt
that
remarkable
its
easy
to
follow
the
first
glass
with
several
others
i
appreciate
the
low
abv
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
readily
available
beers
out
there
at
less
than
5
nice
deep
color
at
first
it
smells
a
bit
overpoweringly
of
hops
but
that
fades
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
too
hoppy
it
has
a
very
bold
flavor
that
fades
slowly
in
the
mouth
and
lingers
for
a
good
while
a
tiny
hint
of
carmelization
is
there
but
only
a
little
i
would
recommend
as
a
good
solid
nofrills
beverage
m
very
average
nothing
exceptional
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
good
carbonation
and
body
picked
us
a
six
pack
of
this
on
my
anniversary
weekend
in
phoenix
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
that
it
was
a
red
ale
because
drinking
it
from
the
bottle
in
the
hotel
room
it
had
more
of
the
taste
characteristics
of
a
pale
ale
oh
well
hop
head
will
rejoice
in
the
red
ale
an
all
around
very
good
beer
that
packs
alot
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
into
a
beer
with
a
modest
alcohol
content
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
but
certainly
one
of
the
better
red
ales
ive
had
overall
a
decent
take
on
a
redamber
what
makes
me
enjoy
it
is
the
fact
that
its
4
4
abv
but
still
relatively
flavorful
definitely
a
good
beer
for
someone
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
hop
fix
on
a
hot
summer
day
levitation
ale
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
bit
confusing
to
me
but
tasty
none
the
less
i
cant
really
see
myself
picking
this
up
instead
of
an
ipa
or
pale
ale
but
perhaps
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
different
i
would
one
thing
is
for
certain
this
is
the
hoppiest
amber
i
have
ever
tasted
it
poured
a
hazy
medium
brown
that
supported
a
large
light
brown
rocky
head
that
was
bellowing
above
the
top
of
the
glass
it
dissipated
at
a
rapid
pace
leaving
just
a
little
residue
behind
although
it
was
enough
for
some
really
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
unusually
complex
with
a
mild
scent
of
toasted
malts
a
nice
dose
of
piney
hops
and
an
earthy
yeast
with
hints
of
sweet
fruit
honey
and
a
nice
citrus
note
the
taste
had
kind
of
a
sweetacidic
flavor
with
a
slight
fruity
note
from
the
onset
then
it
slowly
but
firmly
became
extremely
bitter
with
a
nice
strong
hop
presence
and
a
touch
of
citrus
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
somewhere
between
light
and
medium
in
body
and
nice
and
dry
in
texture
with
a
subtle
soft
carbonation
overall
a
unique
tasting
brew
that
was
very
enjoyable
a
must
try
for
a
hop
head
overall
this
beer
really
keeps
you
guessing
for
what
simple
ingredients
they
brag
about
on
the
bottle
nothing
but
barley
hops
water
and
yeast
this
is
very
complex
o
no
doubt
to
why
this
is
an
award
winning
beer
would
definitly
buy
again
but
i
can
no
longer
get
stone
in
wisconsin
honestly
everything
about
this
from
the
aroma
to
the
taste
to
the
mouth
feel
screams
big
beer
its
truly
amazing
that
stone
packed
this
much
flavor
into
this
type
of
package
most
of
the
time
session
beers
can
come
across
as
bland
watery
and
without
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
with
levitation
stone
has
turned
that
assumption
on
its
ear
creating
a
fullflavored
pale
ale
ipa
red
ale
beer
that
doesnt
have
that
huge
abv
punch
over
the
years
the
boys
in
escondido
have
produced
a
number
of
extraordinary
beers
that
ive
enjoyed
but
quite
honestly
levitation
may
be
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
love
stone
and
i
love
this
beer
this
wont
be
my
last
six
pack
of
levitation
thanks
to
stone
for
continuing
in
this
excellence
o
one
of
the
more
powerful
red
ales
ive
had
my
favorite
amber
so
far
its
got
plenty
of
hops
plenty
of
flavor
and
is
light
enough
to
drink
all
day
long
this
beer
accomplishes
all
it
seeks
out
to
accomplish
the
beer
pours
out
a
cloudy
woody
brown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
on
top
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
light
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
you
get
light
citrus
and
grapefruit
tones
from
the
dry
hopping
thanks
to
the
dry
hopping
the
hops
are
forward
on
the
drink
but
quickly
allow
the
malts
to
take
center
stage
the
beer
finishes
clear
and
dry
with
a
resurgence
of
the
hops
on
the
swallow
to
me
this
is
a
san
diegowest
coast
take
on
an
american
amber
ale
theres
a
lot
more
of
a
hop
profile
which
can
be
refreshing
for
hop
heads
looking
for
a
break
from
the
ipa
norm
at
the
bar
this
is
also
a
great
starter
beer
good
offering
sessionable
and
refreshing
for
a
hoppy
beer
o
very
tasty
for
a
low
abv
beer
4
4
therefore
very
high
drinkability
well
done
stone
overall
this
is
an
awesome
low
abv
beer
but
its
pricey
for
a
sixer
more
than
a
stone
ipa
sixer
so
yeah
doesnt
quite
compute
really
overall
there
is
no
doubt
why
this
is
an
award
winning
beer
there
is
a
depth
of
taste
here
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
describe
and
because
this
is
an
ale
make
this
a
session
beer
and
enjoy
i
always
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
is
great
for
a
hot
day
coming
in
at
4
4
abv
o
i
was
surprised
how
hoppy
this
was
for
this
style
but
i
am
not
complaining
it
was
well
balanced
and
refreshing
overall
a
great
beer
i
am
keeping
this
one
in
the
fridge
when
i
can
for
sure
o
very
good
session
beer
reminds
me
of
an
incredibly
hoppy
lager
ive
noticed
that
this
is
my
500th
review
huzzah
unfortunately
this
beer
has
no
particular
significance
its
just
an
enjoyable
drink
not
such
a
bad
way
to
round
off
to
500
just
a
little
too
dry
for
my
liking
and
could
be
a
little
hoppier
in
aroma
but
otherwise
there
is
little
to
complain
about
its
a
damn
tasty
amber
ale
o
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
nice
flavorespecially
for
the
low
abv
id
gladly
drink
again
and
share
with
friends
overall
a
really
nice
session
beer
for
a
hot
day
when
you
want
something
a
little
darker
a
very
nice
refreshing
low
abv
beer
it
doesnt
sacrifice
taste
because
of
the
lower
alcohol
content
overall
its
an
outstanding
session
beer
and
that
didnt
change
any
when
i
had
it
live
and
in
person
at
the
brewery
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
cloudy
amber
in
color
simialr
to
apple
cider
light
citrus
aroma
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
very
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
but
a
little
on
the
thinner
side
citrus
and
light
pine
hop
aromas
with
a
light
malty
caramel
and
bready
undertone
throughout
finishes
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
but
not
unpleasantly
bitter
light
and
easy
to
drink
less
malty
than
other
red
ales
ive
had
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
packs
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
for
a
low
abv
beer
delicate
hops
and
lightly
malted
lead
to
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
everything
you
expect
in
a
nice
hybrid
between
amber
and
pale
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
and
would
def
recommend
trying
it
overall
an
excellent
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
especially
considering
the
low
abv
essentially
arrogant
bastards
little
brother
o
not
bad
it
is
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
overall
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
overly
exciting
would
definitely
have
it
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
stone
its
very
well
balanced
smooth
and
totally
sessionable
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
pine
resin
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
maltier
than
the
aroma
with
some
nice
caramel
and
toffee
notes
there
is
still
plenty
of
grapefruit
and
pine
too
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
one
enjoyable
beer
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
stone
but
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
creek
water
color
with
fair
amount
of
visible
sediment
reading
others
reviews
and
wondering
if
im
drinking
the
same
beer
clear
amber
red
huh
anyways
comes
topped
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
left
a
big
slimey
lace
righteous
stinky
hops
on
the
nose
with
a
big
caramel
malt
backing
smells
much
like
an
apa
or
an
ipa
bitter
on
the
tongue
watery
slight
caramel
ends
with
a
lemon
zest
that
stays
around
for
a
while
light
watery
smooth
in
the
mouth
eh
this
is
ok
if
only
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
smell
it
would
be
awesome
pours
a
pretty
golden
brown
in
my
tasting
snifter
little
bit
of
head
little
bit
of
lacing
but
not
a
lot
smell
is
great
good
piney
floral
hops
but
not
a
really
strong
nose
taste
is
exceptional
really
great
flavor
for
such
a
light
and
highly
drinkable
beer
i
want
this
to
warm
a
bit
so
i
can
get
more
subtle
flavors
but
it
goes
down
so
good
very
thirst
quenching
an
drinkable
nice
hot
weather
choice
i
could
drink
a
6
right
now
overall
stones
beers
are
really
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
falls
closer
to
the
latter
category
i
totally
get
and
really
appreciate
the
whole
low
abv
tons
of
flavor
thing
this
just
doesnt
really
quite
work
for
me
i
was
expecting
something
closer
to
a
really
hoppedup
americanstyle
bitter
or
something
of
that
ilk
id
like
this
more
wa
bit
more
carameltoast
and
a
bit
less
bitterness
the
hop
flavoraroma
is
great
but
the
bitterness
needs
to
be
balanced
out
a
bit
better
imo
not
something
id
pay
10
00
a
sixer
for
d
quite
high
low
abv
and
tasty
to
boot
overall
get
it
now
great
beer
sessionable
full
of
flavor
and
you
can
drink
several
without
going
overboard
if
this
wasnt
so
darn
expensive
and
more
readily
available
i
would
drink
this
regularly
pours
dark
amber
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
foam
decent
head
retention
and
beautiful
lacing
big
piney
aroma
and
a
good
dose
of
caramel
maltiness
taste
is
similar
but
more
muted
than
the
smell
with
a
moderately
bitter
finish
good
carbonation
and
body
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
whose
drinkability
is
only
hurt
slightly
by
the
bitterness
overall
an
easy
drinking
and
great
tasting
beer
o
really
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
mowing
the
lawn
a
well
balanced
brew
that
is
built
pretty
well
it
went
down
easy
and
left
me
wanting
another
a
great
session
beer
for
those
long
summer
days
with
family
and
friends
d
very
drinkable
they
packed
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
brew
with
a
relatively
low
abv
especially
for
stone
glad
i
got
a
sixer
of
this
it
definitely
garners
a
recommendation
from
me
for
a
nice
easy
to
enjoy
beer
great
beer
highly
recommended
o
overall
an
easy
drinker
not
as
much
depth
of
flavour
as
i
would
have
hoped
and
kind
of
grain
flavoured
a
decent
session
but
nothing
id
plan
a
day
around
vi
concluding
thoughts
stone
yet
again
has
really
impressed
me
i
would
and
will
return
to
this
beer
overall
very
well
balanced
and
full
of
great
flavor
the
alcohol
also
made
me
feel
that
this
was
more
of
a
soda
than
an
alcoholic
beverage
session
beers
dont
get
any
more
easygoing
than
this
in
the
booze
department
and
although
it
would
seem
obvious
that
a
few
of
these
could
be
consumed
in
one
session
i
would
only
have
one
of
these
at
a
time
something
was
missing
here
and
it
seemed
like
this
tried
to
cover
a
lot
of
bases
at
once
while
this
wasnt
a
bad
choice
i
almost
feel
that
its
not
in
the
right
category
its
worth
a
try
only
because
i
havent
had
anything
like
this
and
probably
never
will
again
like
anything
the
levitates
this
defied
conventional
wisdom
and
expectations
o
a
very
good
amberred
ale
my
only
knock
on
this
beer
is
the
light
body
would
seek
out
again
if
only
to
see
if
they
characteristics
change
on
tap
as
opposed
to
bottle
d
fantastic
as
great
a
session
beer
as
ive
found
but
i
think
there
are
better
out
there
unique
amber
ale
both
in
flavor
and
composition
nice
sessionable
ale
which
may
be
an
acquired
taste
with
its
dryness
and
nonsweet
character
a
great
session
brew
amped
up
flavor
good
drinking
for
sure
drinkability
a
very
hoppy
red
ale
one
is
plenty
for
me
i
need
more
malt
to
balance
out
all
that
hoppiness
it
also
needs
less
carbonation
and
a
little
more
body
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
but
its
not
horrible
either
overall
drinkability
a
very
hopforward
ale
one
is
enough
for
me
with
this
one
i
need
more
malts
to
balance
out
all
that
hop
flavor
not
bad
just
a
bit
unbalanced
in
my
opinion
great
if
youre
a
hophead
though
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
visible
carbonation
near
the
edges
of
my
glass
the
dark
color
does
not
permit
me
to
look
all
the
way
through
when
held
up
to
light
it
shines
a
beautiful
redish
hue
head
is
a
nice
tan
hue
and
about
one
finger
tall
retention
is
pretty
decent
and
it
slowly
dissipates
to
a
splotchy
foam
atop
my
beer
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
also
i
smell
some
grassy
hops
taste
is
thinner
than
i
expected
considering
the
color
and
fullness
of
the
smell
the
beer
hits
the
tongue
with
a
taste
of
light
malts
then
it
fades
into
some
hops
aftertaste
is
slightly
piney
and
bitter
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
it
seems
a
little
bit
watery
but
i
have
to
remind
myself
this
is
a
session
beer
not
a
double
ipa
overall
this
would
be
a
great
sessionable
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
slightly
darker
beers
drinking
this
on
a
warm
fall
day
sounds
just
right
it
was
alright
on
the
take
home
scale
id
leave
it
on
the
shelf
o
a
very
sessionable
beer
for
hopheads
very
surprised
how
much
flavor
can
come
out
of
a
4
4
abv
beer
very
delicious
and
surprisingly
sessionworthy
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
buy
regularly
if
you
are
looking
for
a
great
session
beer
this
is
it
very
little
alcohol
and
a
great
smell
and
taste
overall
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
ale
and
can
make
for
a
perfect
sessions
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
initially
i
doubted
stones
ability
to
brew
a
sessionable
beer
that
would
live
up
to
the
standard
of
their
other
big
brews
plainly
put
this
was
stupid
for
those
who
are
sticklers
for
drinkable
sessionable
beers
this
is
one
area
where
stone
delivers
one
of
my
new
favorite
ambers
no
question
overall
i
cant
say
ill
ever
buy
this
brew
again
o
very
tasty
beer
definitely
will
drink
again
but
will
search
out
a
known
fresh
source
recommended
red
overall
one
of
the
most
flavorful
american
ambers
that
i
have
had
in
a
while
truly
qualifies
as
a
gooddrinkableflavorful
session
beer
at
4
4
always
looking
for
a
great
session
beer
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
for
me
great
bitter
citrus
aromas
with
just
enough
malt
balance
on
the
taste
to
keep
the
acidity
in
check
great
piney
hop
character
with
a
nice
citrusy
finish
my
only
complaint
on
this
one
is
the
price
for
11
99
a
six
i
would
prefer
stone
keep
the
etched
bottles
and
give
me
a
4
abv
beer
at
a
more
reasonable
price
great
light
ale
easily
one
of
the
best
sub
5
beers
out
there
i
especially
like
the
english
malt
quality
of
this
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
great
strong
taste
of
hops
long
finish
and
entirely
pleasant
to
consume
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
level
there
is
also
an
unwelcoming
film
left
in
your
mouth
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
another
respectable
brew
from
stone
i
really
didnt
find
anything
overly
impressive
here
but
it
is
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
o
i
had
never
had
this
beer
but
friends
raved
about
it
i
finally
had
the
chance
and
was
not
disappointed
the
low
abv
scared
me
off
for
some
time
but
i
went
to
a
bar
where
this
was
the
only
decent
beer
on
the
menu
so
i
was
forced
into
it
glad
that
happened
this
is
a
perfectly
find
and
well
crafted
beer
i
understand
the
idea
behind
the
brew
i
just
dont
find
the
flavor
all
that
great
an
amber
for
hop
heads
o
overall
a
quality
brew
4s
all
across
the
board
for
this
one
i
appreciate
what
stone
did
with
this
one
i
can
get
my
hop
fix
without
being
knocked
on
my
ass
and
having
no
tastebuds
left
after
three
or
four
very
approachable
abv
i
will
drink
plenty
of
this
over
the
coming
summer
months
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
a
nice
solid
brew
and
typical
of
stone
i
have
found
people
love
or
hate
stone
its
very
drinkable
enjoy
d
great
big
flavor
for
a
low
abv
beer
this
could
make
a
nice
session
beer
by
virtue
of
the
abv
but
may
be
to
strong
in
flavor
for
some
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
this
is
a
little
more
hoppy
than
id
like
an
amberred
ale
to
be
that
being
said
it
is
a
very
good
beer
this
tastes
a
whole
lot
like
an
ipa
to
me
although
im
used
to
drinking
abita
jockamo
ipa
which
im
told
isnt
entirely
representative
of
the
style
this
isnt
my
personal
favorite
but
i
can
definitely
respect
what
stone
has
done
with
this
brew
its
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
will
most
likely
buy
this
again
o
honest
simple
impressive
beer
i
can
definitely
see
this
becoming
one
of
my
gotos
powerful
smooth
and
definitely
worthy
of
that
gold
medal
this
was
a
decent
amber
not
really
among
the
best
but
overall
an
easy
to
drink
beer
very
good
american
amber
i
will
definitely
be
searching
for
this
one
again
gotta
love
beers
that
pull
off
being
this
light
without
sacrificing
flavor
id
be
happy
with
sessioning
this
one
stone
levitation
ale
pours
a
big
stiff
head
over
a
clear
burnt
orange
brew
carbonation
is
spritzy
and
the
nose
is
bright
spicy
resinous
marmelade
hops
the
hopforward
theme
carries
through
to
the
flavor
hoppy
hoppy
hoppy
and
a
little
oily
almost
up
front
with
barley
hulls
and
nutty
notes
off
the
back
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
long
grassy
hop
aftertaste
very
much
a
session
ale
for
hopheads
low
in
alcohol
4
4abv
but
lots
of
flavor
though
with
those
oily
notes
i
prefer
the
nose
personally
as
a
red
ale
i
would
take
several
before
this
but
i
am
not
sure
ive
had
a
better
lower
abv
red
ale
a
12
pack
of
this
would
work
nicely
at
a
summer
bbq
when
in
the
mood
for
some
hops
i
rarely
stray
from
the
ipa
arena
but
tried
levitation
on
my
sons
recommendation
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
levitation
is
a
mildly
hoppy
and
smooth
drinking
ale
im
impressed
levitation
would
make
a
good
session
beer
with
its
low
abv
stone
brewing
is
yet
to
let
me
down
finish
bitter
citric
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
on
the
lips
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
and
i
think
i
might
have
found
my
new
go
to
session
beer
and
beer
to
give
to
craft
beer
newbies
to
try
easy
drinking
and
low
alcohol
will
make
this
a
good
session
beer
for
me
this
is
really
tasty
light
brownslightly
amber
nice
head
a
little
lacing
there
is
a
sour
hop
smell
that
comes
through
slightly
in
the
taste
but
pleasant
i
really
love
the
smooth
graininess
that
this
beer
has
it
has
a
distinct
malt
taste
but
it
isnt
overly
toasty
or
sweet
the
light
body
would
make
having
a
few
very
easy
easy
drinking
and
low
in
alcohol
truly
sessionable
o
very
hop
forward
for
a
lower
abv
beer
but
i
kind
of
expected
that
from
stone
overall
this
a
great
session
beer
for
hopheads
stone
levitation
ale
has
a
red
colour
and
a
crappy
1
mm
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
sweet
woodiness
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
bitter
hoppy
woodiness
it
has
a
nice
frothy
mouthfeel
overall
i
liked
this
red
ale
tasty
woody
hoppy
o
this
beer
shows
potential
but
needs
tweaks
in
the
flavor
dept
with
a
more
dynamic
or
intense
flavor
profile
this
would
be
a
big
winner
o
impressive
to
start
but
falls
short
in
the
end
had
hoped
it
would
be
sessionable
but
the
dryness
and
sharp
finish
detract
from
the
drinkability
finally
got
to

slightly

i
really
liked
this
brew
stone
brewing
really
shows
us
they
can
make
a
low
abv
beer
with
full
flavor
i
think
its
very
very
drinkable
and
goes
with
so
many
dishes
that
you
can
have
a
couple
or
more
with
just
about
any
meal
i
definitely
say
give
it
a
try

this
is
one
of
the
best
session
beers
out
there
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
is
very
refreshing
it
reminded
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
red
but
either
way
its
a
good
beer
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
havent
yet
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
really
large
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
passion
fruit
and
pine
tastes
like
bitter
hops
passion
fruit
pineapple
pine
that
makes
it
really
tasty
and
it
finishes
really
dry
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
to
back
it
up
drinkability
is
high
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
stone
brews
arrogant
bastard
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
this
is
pretty
much
a
similar
sessionable
version
definitely
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
probably
a
bit
too
much
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
overall
very
sessionable
brown
pour
with
a
slight
ruby
highlight
and
a
1finger
loose
tan
head
nutty
toasty
earthy
caramel
malt
aroma
with
a
good
balance
of
spicy
pine
and
citrus
hops
floral
and
spicy
hop
notes
punctuate
the
flavor
with
hints
of
orange
zest
almond
and
a
robust
caramel
malt
background
theres
a
touch
of
dry
toasted
biscuit
that
lingers
afterwords
too
medium
body
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
session
beer
poured
a
deep
rich
amber
color
with
an
impressive
cap
of
off
white
foam
big
hoppy
aromas
resiny
pine
citrus
grassy
with
a
little
sweetness
as
well
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
with
good
hoppy
flavors
citrus
floral
up
front
and
a
light
caramel
backbone
a
big
flavorful
beer
considering
its
meager
alcohol
content
a
six
pack
is
perfect
for
any
occasion
d
really
great
thanks
to
the
low
abv
upon
hearing
stones
is
pulling
out
of
wisconsin
i
had
to
try
this
one
which
i
had
never
seen
before
it
pours
a
medium
dark
amber
color
as
a
semistrong
scent
of
hops
tickle
your
nose
the
hops
continue
well
into
its
taste
as
well
not
quite
to
the
strength
of
an
ipa
but
still
very
evident
it
does
finish
rather
smooth
though
if
you
are
trying
dont
expect
the
typical
amber
or
ale
flavor
here
d
best
described
as
arrogant
bastards
little
brother
if
you
like
that
youll
probably
like
this
drink
another
above
average
beer
from
stone
worth
seeking
out
drink
ability
is
okay
i
cant
see
myself
wanting
more
than
two
of
these
the
aftertaste
is
what
ruins
it
it
tastes
like
i
swallowed
a
bitter
pill
while
drinking
it
it
tastes
good
but
the
lingering
taste
deters
me
away
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
long
lasting
head
aroma
of
citrusy
piney
hops
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
slight
fruitiness
taste
is
citrusy
hops
sweet
malt
some
light
fruity
spices
a
nice
med
body
palate
very
nice
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
some
sweet
spices
ending
with
some
grapefruit
citrusy
hops
overall
a
smooth
and
very
nicely
balanced
and
flavorfull
amber
ale
very
enjoyable
nicely
done
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
pretty
well
balanced
but
like
i
mentioned
lighter
than
i
expected
for
both
the
style
and
the
brewery
it
has
a
clean
bitter
finish
and
even
though
the
head
was
so
huge
the
carbonation
level
is
good
drinkability
is
good
it
would
work
well
if
you
wanted
to
sip
it
or
have
it
as
a
nice
refreshment
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
as
big
and
bold
as
most
stone
brews
but
a
very
good
beer
none
the
less
this
beer
pours
a
dark
yet
slightly
opaque
brown
the
head
is
a
fluffy
white
with
very
nice
retention
and
leaves
a
beautiful
lacing
hops
and
a
beady
smell
are
present
in
the
nose
the
hops
in
the
aroma
dont
manifest
themselves
in
the
flavor
but
there
are
some
hints
of
a
nuttiness
the
finish
is
almost
nonexistent
this
would
make
a
great
cold
weather
session
beer
because
its
dark
and
flavorful
but
still
light
and
has
a
pretty
low
abv
d
i
am
really
digging
this
too
bad
i
do
not
have
more
of
these
because
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
at
4
4
this
is
a
good
beer
any
time
during
the
year
but
probably
even
better
during
the
warmer
months
with
the
citrusy
crisp
taste
and
low
alcohol
you
can
really
have
at
this
this
beer
pours
a
bubbly
clear
auburn
color
with
thick
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
mainly
pine
with
a
hint
of
fruit
followed
by
a
very
bitter
acidic
flavor
it
has
a
very
thin
almost
watery
mouthfeel
stone
levitation
ale
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
not
recommended
drink
i
had
to
drive
home
but
would
have
loved
to
stick
around
for
a
few
more
pints
of
this
nice
little
beer
update
92911
this
is
more
impressive
today
than
a
year
ago
when
i
first
had
it
the
flavor
is
more
complex
with
each
bottle
this
is
beer
number
two
to
earn
a
permanent
placement
in
my
refrigerator
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
definitely
doesnt
blow
you
away
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
a
bad
beer
or
not
what
the
brewer
intended
wouldnt
recommend
for
a
tasting
but
would
certainly
pick
up
a
six
for
a
gettogether
if
i
can
find
it
one
of
my
sessions
this
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hop
a
bit
citrus
bitter
and
malty
toastiness
that
is
backed
by
a
good
feel
nose
is
pine
and
malt
the
beer
is
quite
simple
but
has
a
nice
malt
back
that
is
a
bit
more
defined
than
a
apa
a
tad
grassy
bitter
with
a
nougat
sweet
malt
as
far
as
an
amber
ale
goes
this
certainly
would
register
on
the
hoppier
side
of
things
its
drinkable
but
probably
not
a
top
pick
from
me
for
the
reason
stated
above
just
too
onedimensional
and
boring
if
this
is
one
of
the
least
hoppy
beers
stone
brews
thats
saying
something
overall
a
medium
hopped
brew
with
mildly
sweet
and
smooth
maltiness
and
carbonation
all
blend
well
leaves
a
mild
hop
dry
bite
with
some
alcohol
warmth
a
good
brew
but
not
a
good
brew
there
is
not
a
ton
to
say
about
this
beer
but
it
is
a
great
every
day
drinker
very
tasty
i
will
probably
continue
to
buy
many
more
6
packs
fabulous
beer
very
hoppy
although
it
is
a
more
earthy
type
of
hop
note
wonderful
balance
of
malthops
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
stone
beers
never
cease
to
impress
the
hell
out
of
me
it
seems
like
they
just
dont
miss
although
their
pale
ale
was
not
great
but
not
bad
either
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
pretty
well
and
it
could
easily
become
a
session
beer
nice
down
to
earth
beer
will
have
to
try
again
i
think
this
could
be
high
on
my
list
if
the
carbonation
wasnt
so
screwed
up
some
very
conflicting
ratings
i
think
some
got
bad
bottles
this
a
pretty
stellar
stone
beer
some
others
are
better
but
i
would
get
again
d
this
is
flavorful
refreshing
and
perfect
to
session
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
medium
foamy
offwhite
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
small
patches
of
lacing
piney
hops
along
with
caramel
and
malt
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
with
hops
toasted
malt
and
grapefruit
flavors
the
finish
is
balanced
between
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malt
leaving
a
roasted
malt
aftertaste
interesting
take
on
an
amber
ale
leave
it
to
stone
to
put
a
spin
on
it
like
this
insanely
drinkable
drinkability
i
really
do
enjoy
this
one
quite
drinkabile
and
about
as
balanced
as
stone
is
ever
going
to
get
granted
its
no
ruination
but
thats
probably
why
i
like
it
it
fills
a
necessary
niche
a
hoppy
flavorful
ale
that
wont
put
you
down
after
two
or
three
glasses
might
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
ones
noncraft
fans
d
great
really
tasty
stone
brew
the
best
amber
that
ive
had
in
a
long
while
i
would
and
will
drink
this
again
for
sure
dont
know
why
i
have
missed
this
one
in
the
past
but
it
was
stellar
no
doubt
good
balance
between
hoppiness
and
sweet
malt
you
expect
stone
to
have
strong
hops
and
this
was
lighter
than
expected
the
beer
was
quite
refreshing
despite
the
expected
strength
based
on
color
alone
very
floral
nature
but
not
overwhelming
nice
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
smell
is
not
like
most
beer
this
is
one
you
shouldnt
pass
up
d
exceptionally
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
excellent
brew
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
stone
ive
tried
guess
im
more
of
a
big
beer
guy
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
the
session
brew
lover
overall
excellent
beer
overall
you
rarely
get
this
much
flavor
from
a
low
abv
beer
this
is
one
you
need
to
try
i
will
be
buying
many
more
in
the
future
this
brew
pours
a
nice
deep
mahogany
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
smoggy
two
finger
head
that
stays
with
a
rim
of
lacing
on
the
outerthe
smell
is
a
perfect
vibrant
balnace
of
fruity
stonefruit
hops
and
sweet
toffeecaramel
maltsthe
mouthfeel
is
just
under
medium
and
has
tastes
of
raspberriesstonefruitsweet
caramel
candy
and
leaves
you
with
a
bitter
stonefruit
finish
which
makes
you
want
another
sipoverall
im
so
glad
ive
tried
it
but
given
its
nearly
the
same
price
as
the
rest
of
their
range
we
have
here
id
rather
have
a
ruination
but
in
saying
that
there
really
isnt
too
much
wrong
with
this
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
but
i
just
prefer
their
other
brews
cheers
d
considering
the
low
abv
and
the
great
taste
you
could
drink
these
all
day
easily
pours
a
dulled
coppery
amber
color
with
nice
fluffy
cap

offwhite
head
scent
is
of
grapefruit
mango
hints
of

with
a

and
roasted

brings
the
components
of
scent
fruity
tropical
and
citrus
hops
from
the
begining
with
a
nice
sweet
carmely
malt
backbone
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
balance
and
drinkability
an
excellent
amber
drinkability
hard
to
believe
that
a
beer
with
this
much
flavor
is
only
4

makes
it
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
solid
amber
ale
nice
hoppy
profile
with
the
perfect
amount

this
is
only

abv
if
i
could
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
this
would
be
my
goto
session
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
an
easy
drinker
that
is
perfect
for
a
session
this
is
a
miss
for
me
but
those
who
want
a
low
abv
hop
monster
may
enjoy
this
pretty
onenote
hops
hops
hops
its
drinkable
yet
boring
d
wonderful
flavor
made
that
much
more
attractive
by
its
sessionworthy
strength
stone
packs
a
ton
into
this
little
beer
making
it
certainly
among
the
most
drinkable
of
any
ive
had
to
date
another
awesome
one
from
stone
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
medium
foamy
offwhite
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
small
patches
of
lacing
piney
hops
along
with
caramel
and
malt
in

mediumbodied
with

toasted

and

flavors
the
finish
is
balanced
between
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malt
leaving
a
roasted
malt
aftertaste
its
light
enough
to
session
and
is
packed
with
toasty
malt
flavor
with
stones
trademark
hoppiness
definitely
has
its
place
in
their
lineup
this
is
what
ill
reach
for
when
im
thirsty
and
dont
want
a
huge
dipa
or
imperial
stout
drinkability
too
weak
its
like
a
waterdown
stone
ipa
low
alcohol
low
flavor
low
malts
low
drinkability
this
is
the
first
stone
beer
that
i
dont
care
to
drink
again
d
a
very
drinkable
amber
beer
the
only
thing
slowing
me
down
is
the
insane
level
of
head
on
this
brew
its
borderline
outrageous
and
keeping
me
from
drinking
it
time
to
spoon
it
out
stone
levitation
poured
clear
ruddy
amber
in
appearance
with
two
finger
of
beige
foam
that
subsided
to
a
little
layer
on
top
the
foam
is
sticky
leaving
a
mesh
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
smells
like
brown
sugar
caramel
and
piney
the
beer
is
very
dry
with
toasted
malt
flavor
and
a
smooth
bitterness
as
the
beer
warms
it
has
an
earthier
smell
and
taste
like
portobella
mushrooms
the
mouth
feel
is
rounded
with
pleasant
carbonation
all
in
all
a
great
light
beer
for
packing
such
a
large
punch
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
anybody
cheers
drinkability
admittedly
my
distaste
for
red
ale
clouds
my
decision
however
this
one
really
was
not
terrible
better
than
most
red
ales
ive
had
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
grapefruit
hop
quite
fresh
as
well
in
the
taste
small
citrus
like
hop
and
a
nice
balanced
maltiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dryer
small
grapefruit
hop
aftertaste
just
a
decent
ale
with
a
touch
more
hops
d
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
would
most
likely
reach
for
something
else
with
either
more
hop
flavor
or
stronger
this
is
a
good
red
ale
nice
balance
between
the
pineycaramel
flavors
since
i
am
a
hophead
i
would
seek
this
out
again
alas
i
am
in
utah
and
they
do
not
distribute
here
i
really
like
stone
they
brew
good
if
very
hoppy
beer

and
great
lacing
smells
strongly
of
citrus
hops
sweet
malt
citrus
grapefruit
and
an
unknown
but
familiar
aroma
yeast
strain
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
hops
hint
of
pine
hint
of
mango
sweet
malt
yeast
and
possibly
pineapple
overall
good
appearance
body
and
blend
only
stone
could
pack
this
level
of
hopping
into
a
session
ale
i
dont
think
ive
ever
before
encountered
such
a
relativelylow
abv
beer
with
such
bold
but
complex
hop
bittering
also
surprising
that
the
malt
is
sufficient
to
withstand
the
hops
onslaught
yet
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
quite
moderate
this
will
be
a
future
goto
when
i
need
a
hops
fix
but
a
bit
less
horsepower
d
this
was
a
nice
strongly
flavored
amber
ale
with
great
body
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
wish
it
had
more
juicy
hops
and
less
metallic
like
a
smaller
version
of
the
13th
anniversary
beer
this
is
still
nicely
enjoyable
but
not
amazingly
good
d
a
highly
drinkable
session
beer
overall
very
tasty
and
interestingly
simple
d
very
sessionable
beer
light
hops
and
even
lighter
malt
with
no
alcohol
presence
is
very
nice
for
drinkability
i
believe
that
this
beer
is
the
younger
brother
of
arrogant
bastard
it
has
less
hops
less
malt
and
less
alcohol
but
its
flavors
are
very
similar
an
excellent
beer
from
stone
and
one
which
i
will
definitely
revisit
soon
this
is
a
great
beer
to
really
excite
your
palate
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
more
than
two
back
to
back
before
getting
a
little
palate
fatigue
there
is
a
lot
to
appreciate
about
this
beer
and
it
really
commands
a
lot
of
attention
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
great
stuff
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
loose
foamy
head
nose
hints
at
a
hoppy
bitterness
which
appears
at
the
first
sip
however
it
is
a
less
than
satisfying
one
dimensional
hoppiness
which
predominates
the
prevailing
flavor
is
ephemeral
leaving
a
mere
intimation
of
what
might
have
been
could
drink
more
than
one
but
its
not
an
ale
to
savor
m
d
nice
light
body
with
great
flavor
and
balance
very
drinkable
dstill
surprised
how
does
stone
do
it
so
much
taste
in
such
a
small
abv
adjunct
brewers
take
note
d
easy
to
drink
this
amber
ale
low
abv
and
big
hop
taste
make
this
easy
to
session
for
me
i
know
hops
can
range
from
small
amounts
to
large
amounts
for
amber
ales
and
this
one
had
a
ton
of
hops
and
not
so
much
malt
served
from
tap
into
a
tumbler
pours
a
brownish
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
maintains
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
and
a
massive
hop
note
the
flavor
was
of
malt
citrus
and
a
very
subtle
hop
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
the
aroma
was
very
nice
for
hopheads
and
the
flavor
was
very
nice
for
all
other
beer
drinkers
out
there
it
went
down
really
smoothly
kudos
to
stone
for
this
one
really
enjoyed
this
on
cask
now
i
get
to
try
it
in
a
bottle
pours
a
really
reddish
brown
color
with
a
mega
head
i
mean
mega
that
is
4
fingers
and
leaves
ridiculous
lacing
aroma
is
on
point
with
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
red
ale
has
a
solid
hop
prescence
with
some
nice
caramelized
malts
and
a
spicy
herbal
note
has
a
grate
malty
hop
taste
that
i
cant
believe
come
s
from
such
a
low
abv
brew
caramel
spice
pine
and
vanilla
come
through
perfect
carbonation
as
it
is
low
or
at
least
has
silky
sewer
bubbles
drinkability
is
great
low
abv
and
has
a
huge
flavornprofile
gotta
keep
this
in
my
fridge
db
very
refreshing
beer
with
lower
abv
it
has
that
signature
stone
hoppy
taste
but
malt
is
mixed
in
very
well
i
could
session
this
one
any
day
i
might
depending
on
how
much
money
i
want
to
spend
stone
is
solid
d
super
drinkable
great
session
beer
with
a
nice
low
abv
and
a
great
flavor
without
being
too
in
your
face
this
is
one
ill
certainly
revisit
d
the
perfect
session
beer
and
possibly
the
best
amber
that
ive
ever
had
like
a
topquality
british
pub
beer
this
beer
exactly
fits
my
beerdrinking
needs
its
available
in
a
small
bottle
its
low
in
alcohol
it
has
a
bitter
complexity
that
sustains
interest
and
it
is
impressively
easy
to
drink
beautiful
clear
darkbrown
appearance
a
formidable
head
like
beaten
egg
whites
hoppy
honeyed
taste
i
could
easily
drink
three
of
them
with
no
palate
fatigue
and
no
hangover
overall
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
some
wonderful
mild
flavors
going
for
it
the
malt
base
reminds
me
of
a
good
english
mild
or
brown
ale
but
the
hops
remind
me
of
american
pale
ale
a
great
combo
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
thin
or
pleasantly
light
depending
on
your
mood
mouthfeel
brief
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
a
nicely
bitter
finish
of
pine
and
citrus
wasnt
initially
impressed
but
this
one
grew
on
me
the
finish
is
this
very
drinkable
brews
best
quality
d
im
going
back
and
forth
here
bw
a
4
and
a
4
5
decided
to
bump
it
up
because
of
the
low
4
4
abv
flavorful
lowalcohol
beers
should
be
rewarded
a
bit
and
its
only
10
of
the
score
very
nice
beer
well
hopped
i
gave
it
a
little
extra
for
mouthfeel
just
because
i
thought
stone
did
a
lot
with
a
4
4
abv
beer
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
stone
so
far
yet
its
still
pretty
good
not
the
best
amber
ale
ive
had
but
surely
better
than
many
worth
a
taste
my
first
but
not
my
last
bright
amber
red
surprising
in
the
glass
with
a
thick
head
that
required
a
slow
pour
a
lot
of
lace
and
the
beer
itself
is
quite
clear
the
smell
is
west
coast
hops
with
a
bit
of
a
bready
grain
malt
in
the
background
maybe
a
bit
weak
overall
the
taste
matches
the
smell
a
fair
dose
of
hops
come
to
the
forefront
with
a
decent
backing
of
bread
and
grain
the
malt
character
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
maybe
a
bit
thin
for
the
amount
of
hop
in
this
beer
given
the
style
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
is
tight
and
lively
the
hop
oil
gives
a
drying
lasting
bitter
sensation
slightly
slick
due
to
the
hops
quite
sessionable
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
overall
pretty
good
notes
while
this
beer
may
not
be
super
complex
or
the
most
flavorbitterwhatever
ale
out
there
it
is
damn
good
it
fills
a
very
necessary
gap
for
me
at
least
a
nice
hoppy
session
beer
overall
a
solid
stone
brew
maybe
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
works
d
eh
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
has
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
and
that
is
about
it
definitely
one
dimensional
d
pretty
drinkable
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
beer
is
only
4
4
for
a
session
beer
this
low
in
alcohol
it
is
huge
in
taste
this
is
a
runofthemill
amber
ale
thats
way
overhopped
no
complexity
of
flavors
the
sweetness
does
not
integrate
at
all
with
the
hops
which
really
just
take
over
the
beer
not
sure
what
stone
was
trying
to
do
here
or
if
they
bothered
to
think
about
what
they
were
doing
but
this
one
does
nothing
for
me
d
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
american
amberred
i
understand
they
were
attempting
to
show
good
flavored
beers
can
come
in
small
packages
4
4
abv
and
i
feel
they
did
that
but
the
hopcharacter
strongly
out
dueled
the
malt
in
my
opinion
without
the
hop
in
this
beer
would
be
pretty
flavorless
but
could
be
a
sideeffect
of
the
freshness
of
the
bottle
i
would
drink
again
a
great
lacing
long
lasting
offwhite
head
until
the
very
last
sip
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
the
aroma
lets
you
know
that
this
is
a
stone
beer
and
the
hops
are
coming
despite
the
style
and
low
abv
light
bodied
and
refreshing
awesome
balance
in
the
flavor
profile
a
semi
sweet
toasty
caramel
malt
battles
a
nice
blend
of
pine
citrus
and
earthy
hops
the
light
pine
hops
shine
though
again
on
the
finish
nice
bite
the
near
perfect
hopmalt
balance
and
light
profile
make
this
a
very
drinkable
ale
pours
a
brickish
dark
orange
color
tan
head
with
some
stick
smells
of
glorious
piny
hops
taste
hits
with
a
pile
of
grapefruity
citrusy
hops
and
ends
with
even
more
finishes
smooth
and
a
bit
sweet
kind
of
dry
but
not
as
much
as
id
expect
im
missing
some
malt
in
this
beer
though
this
is
an
impressive
stab
at
a
lower
alcohol
amber
ale
for
sure
but
it
tastes
like
a
low
body
ale
thats
disguised
by
a
ton
of
hopping
and
dryhopping
a
quality
brew
but
id
rather
reach
for
something
else
if
im
in
need
of
a
lighter
beer
its
just
too
thin
a
nice
session
amber
that
you
should
when
youre
just
looking
to
kick
back
a
few
one
of
my
fathers
day
gifts
pours
about
12
inch
foam
into
the
stemmed
glass
a
nice
coppery
near
brown
shade
wonderful
piney
smell
and
an
equally
piney
hoppy
citrusy
taste
nectar
of
the
gods
extremely
drinkable
i
could
have
three
or
four
at
a
sitting
d
dangerously
so
d
all
day
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
session
beer
it
lacks
complexity
in
the
taste
but
is
still
a
nice
ale
this
is
the
least
complex
tasting
ale
i
have
had
so
far
from
stone
but
it
is
the
weakest
in
strength
so
one
would
expect
that
d
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
filling
i
could
not
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
i
might
buy
it
again
not
first
pick
when
most
people
think
of
stone
they
think
of
big
bold
beers
with
a
ton
of
hops
this
is
the
everyday
drinking
beer
that
clocks
in
at
4
4
abv
and
has
more
malt
than
hops
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
and
well
made
this
is
a
great
amber
ale
that
sessions
wonderfully
i
dont
always
feel
like
an
8
hop
monster
or
a
big
stout
and
i
am
glad
stone
make
this
beer
serving
type
bottle
d
this
could
be
an
every
day
beer
for
me
it
would
be
spectacular
if
i
had
a
keg
lying
around
the
house
for
my
own
use
its
so
boss
my
impression
is
that
its
good
but
i
wont
hand
over
its
medals
ill
order
it
again
the
best
i
had
and
if
you
can
find
it
its
very
well
worth
ordering
is
the
epic
08
ill
review
it
soon
drinkability
a
nice
beer
all
around
d
i
would
consider
this
a
nice
year
around
option
big
enough
flavor
for
winter
and
light
enough
alcohol
for
summer

abv
md
this
beer
is
pretty
thick
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
lot
of
small
bubbles
it
is
a
really
nice
beer
for
a
such
a
low
abv
and
is
a
little
brother
to
some
of
the
other
stone
beers
it
is
a
great
choice
when
you
need
a
beer
to
unwind
with
d
i
wanted
to
keep
drinking
it
but
held
off
to
let
the
experience
linger
how
does
that
sound
for
drinkability
my
only
thing
i
would
change
is
i
would
make
the
taste
a
little
stronger
maybe
more
malt
but
that
is
being
picky
d
very
poor
i
dont
know
i
hated
the
taste
of
this
i
dont
want
to
drink
this
again
buy
again
yes
poured
bottle
into
pint

good

a
half
of
off

lasted

duration

plenty
of

deep
reddish
brown
colour
faintly
sweet
aroma
with
some

and
little
else
smooth
drinkingmedium
bodied
with
some
sweetness
the
aforementioned
floral
hoppiness
and
then
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
certainly
drink
again
as
a
session
ale
think
this
would
be
quite
versatile
with
food
since
its
not
a
total
tastebudassault
and
yet
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
than
i
expected
its
refreshing
its
bitingly
fizzy
and
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
a
bonus
at
dinnertime
i
will
happily
drink
the
sixpack
i
dragged
home
but
i
probably
wont
buy
another
one
worth
a
try
but
keep
your
expectations
in
line
with
the
brewery
d
this
is
a
true
session
beer
easy
to
drink
light
but
with
a
well
balanced
flavor
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
should
find
in
most
traditional
bars
as
opposed
to
bmc
but
were
a
long
way
from
those
large
macro
conglomerates
taking
a
back
seat
to
any
beers
that
are
actually
good
since
the
majority
of
beer
drinkers
drink
beer
for
the
alcohol
not
the
taste
too
bad
nonetheless
this
is
a
solid
beer
im
down
with
mellow
milds
and
lighter
brews
but
this
one
is
all
over
the
palce
with
no
direction
home
oh
well
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
had
a
3
finger
light
frothy
head
that
ate
at
itself
from
the
inside
as
it
lessened
head
lasted
510
minutes
large
streams
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
color
was
a
dark
orangey
amber
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
aroma
was
hoppy
small
amount
of
brown
sugar
sweet
also
hints
of
a
molasses
type
aroma
flavor
was
hoppy
spicy
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
felt
solid
in
the
mouth
coated
a
bit
to
well
was
almost
to
sticky
very
pleasant
to
drink
well
balanced
with
a
mellow
finish
overall
another
good
offering
from
stone
to
be
honest
it
seemed
like
a
toned
down
arrogant
bastard
in
some
ways
i
would
drink
it
again
on
tap
d
very
intresting
interpretation
of
an
amber
ale
with
a
spicey
twist
drank
well
an
was
really
enjoying
this
offering
from
stone
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
loads
of
flavor
and
one
hell
of
a
hoppy
nose
as
i
said
before
the
only
down
side
is
that
the
flavor
doesnt
deliver
the
same
hop
punch
as
the
nose
d
its
pretty
drinkable
very
low
abv
but
on
the
same
token
the
flavors
arent
as
potent
as
id
like
either
there
are
other
ambers
id
go
with
being
from
the
east
coast
but
if
youre
out
west
i
guess
this
would
be
a
decent
option
for
the
style
damn
fine
product
poured
a
small
to
medium
sized
light
copper
tan
frothy
head
that
mostly
faded
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
copper
amber
aroma
is
hop
caramel
yeast
caramel
old
leather
roasty
flavor
is
like
aroma
and
quite
tasty
not
overly
hop
fruity
thank
god
good
body
and
carbonation
great
finish
thats
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
most
definitely
a
session
beer
i
felt
this
was
a
very
good
beer
from
stone
again
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
for
the
ipa
lover
as
it
isnt
overboard
on
the
abv
dare
i
say
arrogant
bastard
light
drinkability
the
flavors
arent
incredibly
robust
but
its
an
easy
drinking
ale
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
md
keeps
a
grasp
on
a
lot
of
the
flavors
this
is
a
low
abv
amber
ale
it
has
so
much
kickflavor
drinkability
this
has
quite
a
full
character
which
i
enjoyed
this
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
even
though
i
do
not
get
into
this
style
that
often
d
a
very
easydrinking
refreshing
beer
the
pineapple
flavor
is
quite
pleasant
but
i
would
expect
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
for
this
type
of
beer
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
flavorful
beer
for
it

this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
arrogant
bastard
for
those
who
are
new
to
stone
or
want
to
take
it
easy
on
the
bitterness
level
for
the
night
if
i
have
to
say
so
myself
id
say
this
is
a
weak
arrogant
bastard
but
i
do
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
and
ill
be
sharing
it
with
my
friends
at
later
dates
overall
this
is
another
good
offering
from
stone
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
i
have
had
at
this
low
of
an
abv
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
a
full
6
pack
of
these
soon
d
i
could
probably
go
through
a
whole
bunch
of
these
especially
with
the
low
abv
tasty
enough
to
not
get
too
boring
but
not
overwhelming
either
pours
out
a
hazy
amber
brew
with
smallish
head
head
dissipates
quickly
mild
carbonation
smells
very
nice
mostly
earthy
type
hops
mildly
hoppy
beer
nicely
rounded
very
slight
tartness
that
works
well
mouthfeel
is
blah
in
all
fairness
i
dont
know
how
old
this
beer
is
not
dated
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
just
about
anytime
d
i
for
one
like
big
beers
and
refers
to
5
5
abv
beers
as
session
beers
because
most
under
that
lack
flavor
in
my
experience
however
this
one
kicks
some
ass
its
one
of
those
beers
that
if
i
had
to
choose
five
beers
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
would
be
one
definitely
worth
trying
i
love
this
beer
just
what
im
after
lots
of
flavor
and
something
i
can
have
more
than
2
of
and
not
need
a
nap
more
like
this
please
d
could
definitely
drink
more
of
these
but
overall
i
am
somewhat
disappointed
in
stone
on
this
one
all
in
all
this
is
highly
drinkable
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
enough
considering
im
finishing
my
4th
one
right
now
and
the
flavor
is
plenty
good
i
might
buy
more
of
this
if
only
to
hand
to
my
fat
tire
drinking
buds
and
hear
their
opinions
drinkability
very
nice
to
sip
on
could
easily
drink
a
number
of
these
overall
a
decent
ale
stone
levitation
the
misunderstood
baby
brother
of
the
stone
family
pours
a
ruby
amber
with
a
creamy
redhued
tan
head
with
very
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
tealike
with
a
floral
nose
grapefruit
toast
and
caramel
tastes
of
geranium
grapefruit
earth
pine
finish
has
more
flora
and
a
dry
cookie
taste
medium
with
a
prickly
carbonation
i
drank
this
pint
well
and
will
do
more
in
the
future
levitation
is
a
fine
fine
beer
d
could
be
more
balanced
tasting
blind
i
would
call
it
an
ipa
not
an
amber
ale
similar
to
arrogant
bastard
drinkability
been
really
excited
to
try
this
whay
a
great
idea
a
session
beer
for
real
beer
lovers
have
when
they
dont
want
to
get
buzzed
because
i
have
to
work
at
6am
tomorrow
perfect
after
having
this
a
few
times
on
tap
at
various
spots
im
finally
getting
down
to
rating
it
based
on
a
bottle
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
levitation
pours
a
hazy
red
with
a
big
fluffy
eggshell
head
there
are
a
few
spots
of
lace
here
and
there
that
get
left
on
the
glass
the
head
subsides
to
a
thin
layer
ring
of
creaminess
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
grassy
herbal
and
hemp
are
big
taste
has
some
light
caramel
malt
notes
very
light
the
herbal
hop
character
takes
center
stage
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
what
would
you
expect
from
a
4
4
brew
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
seems
fitting
based
on
the
abv
drinkability
is
up
there
the
fact
that
its
a
good
beer
helps
too
this
would
not
be
a
session
ale
for
me
a
great
beer
im
in
the
chi
and
we
just
got
some
stone
distribution
like
this
week
so
im
pretty
psyched
about
this
while
trying
to
review
objectively
a
little
less
roast
a
little
more
body
but
hey
im
not
complaining
di
have
a
really
hard
time
drinking
these
slowly
really
nice
flavorful
and
thirstquenching
stone
came
to
chicago
just
in
time
for
summer
and
i
have
a
feeling
this
will
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
in
the
upcoming
warmer
months
355ml
bottle
at
bar
volo
in
toronto
on
pours
a
burgundy
red
hue
with
dark
ruby
edges
two
fingers
of
cream
coloured
offwhite
head
and
speckles
of
lacing
on
the
flute
glass
smell
and
taste
are
strong
citrus
tangerine
and
clementine
slight
yeastiness
pink
grapefruit
burnt
caramel
light
nuttiness
toast
and
a
bold
hop
bitterness
to
finish
so
much
flavour
for
such
a
light
beer
very
impressive
mouthfeel
is
medium
lush
and
slick
spicy
hop
punch
midbody
lingering
dryness
with
a
mildly
citric
aftertaste
the
ideal
session
beer
if
this
were
available
in
ontario
stores
it
would
never
leave
my
fridge
i
have
to
assume
this
is
the
lowest
abv
beer
stone
makes
so
theres
major
drinkability
to
it
its
tasty
too
so
that
helps
d
somewhat
harder
to
drink
than
expected
for
something
with
such
low
abv
maybe
its
just
the
stronger
than
expected
flavors
drinkability
huge
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
ale
not
really
what
i
would
think
of
as
an
amber
ale
seems
more
like
a
very
bitter
american
hop
version
of
an
english
bitter
very
tasty
and
sessionable
due
to
the
low
alcohol
but
the
bitterness
and
tartness
is
offputting
for
the
light
body
and
hampers
drinkability
this
is
a
session
beer
for
hopheads
d
it
is
very
drinkable
but
in
the
same
way
that
a
lot
of
other
mediocre
beers
are
you
can
drink
a
lot
before
tiring
a
good
but
not
great
beer
very
sessionable
the
hops
are
quite
strong
this
reminds
me
of
a
dipa
in
taste
and
smell
d
another
winner
from
stone
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
ever
tried
d
could
have
had
this
one
all
night
i
found
this
beer
to
be
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
not
technically
flawless
but
it
was
just
fantastic
the
dry
finish
with
the
wonderful
ballance
of
hops
and
malt
allows
you
to
drink
several
drinkability
bought
this
as
a
single
and
am
very
pleased
at
4
4
abv
this
beer
has
loads
of
wonderful
flavor
and
goes
down
smoothly
as
this
is
only
my
second
brew
from
stone
this
beer
has
me
hooked
on
trying
their
other
beers
great
color
inviting
aroma
the
taste
to
match
and
easy
drinking
i
definately
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
nice
and
refreshing
high
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
will
be
great
during
the
summer
when
you
want
something
crisp
light
and
without
much
alcohol
but
also
full
flavored
and
hoppy
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
recommended
for
such
a
low
abv
and
lighter
body
this
has
some
well
defined
flavor
this
would
make
for
a
great
session
brew
very
good
brew
cost
10
99
for
the
sixpack
not
crazy
about
that
d
great
flavor
low
abv
a
great
session
beer
now
if
only
i
didnt
have
to
buy
it
in
tennessee
at
13
bucks
a
sixer
decently
drinkable
beer
goes
down
easy
not
sure
what
happened
to
this
one
overcarbinated
freshness
not
what
id
come
to
expect
from
the
fine
brewers
of
stone
im
willing
to
revisit
this
one
later
d
low
abv
and
packed
with
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
6pk
of
these
in
one
sitting
without
getting
tired
of
it
another
great
offering
from
stone
d
it
a
great
beer
great
for
food
pairing
very
light
on
the
palate
so
would
be
perfect
for
lighter
fare
d
lots
of
flavor
for
this
abv
sessionable
drinkability
is
good
id
be
honoured
to
have
a
session
on
this
one
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
sessionable
hoppy
brew
with
a
relatively
low
abv
its
one
you
could
drink
more
than
one
of
d
actually
a
nice
session
beer
that
is
not
too
heavy
and
the
alcohol
level
is
nice
and
low
for
a
change
did
they
invent
a
new
style
here
12
ipa
o
a
very
good
introductory
ipa
but
that
is
about
it
a
low
alcohol
yet
refreshing
brew
a
solid
session
ale
definitely
more
geared
on
the
hoppy
side
this
is
a
pretty
dry
beer
not
much
sweetness
despite
being
an
amber
ale
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
sweetness
but
still
a
nice
beer
and
very
sessionable
taste
despite
being
i
guess
what
you
could
call
their
light
beer
this
one
still
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
this
is
how
entry
level
and
session
beers
should
be
done
ample
malt
and
hops
for
its
style
mouthfeel
interplay
of
hops
is
even
nicer
than
many
stones
as
it
doesnt
smack
you
in
the
face
which
is
nice
sometimes
very
drinkable
not
pretentious
it
is
what
it
is
a
very
good
beer
that
isnt
to
the
extreme
for
a
hoppy
amber
id
take
nugget
nectar
over
this
anyday
since
were
talking
flavor
not
abv
overall
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
drank
that
was
under
5
abv
mediumbodied
and
lightly
carbonated
the
levitation
is
a
deliciously
easy
to
drink
brew
this
is
a
fine
session
beer
the
body
was
very
light
for
this
style
drinkability
was
good
i
could
see
having
several
of
these
without
a
problem
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
like
a
lot
but
as
a
red
ale
its
lacking
perhaps
if
they
called
this
red

of
it
before
my
buddies
and

proceeded
to

several
rounds
of
them
and

it

i

beer
which
makes

nice
still
a
bitter

which
is

nice

that
keeps
this

d
really
a
terrific
session
beer
one
of
stones
only
sessions
but
a
damn
good
one
d
this
is
a
great
beer
from
stone
one
of
the
more
timid
brews
by
the
stone
crew
but
has
some
big
muscles
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
brew
could
use
a
bit
more
juice
but
i
imagine
they
had
drinkability
in
mind
they
got
it
would
buy
more
when
i
am
looking
to
session
a
great
craft
beer
a
solid
choice
for
a
more
modest
brew

smelled

could
taste
light
caramel
toffee
citrus
hops
kind
of
surprised
of
the
flavor
for
a
4
4
ale
even
with
that
said
it
was
not
an
excellent
beer
it
was
very
thin
and
did
not
have
a
big
amount
of
flavor
overall
this
beer
could
very
easily
be
a
session
brew
polishing
off
a
six
pack
would
be
easy
since
its
similar
to
a
light
beer
overall
i
would
probably
not
search
this
out
again
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
love
stone
and
i
will
stick
with
the
ruination
arrogant
bastard
or
ris
when
i
buy
from
them

pours
a

with
a
thick
creme
head

is

sawdust
and
citrus
flavor
is
a
tight
citrus
with
wood
thick
malty
tone
but
bringing
muted
hop
character
interestingly
subdued
feel
is
thick
enough
on
liquid
carbonation
is
a
bit
boisterous
a
nice
ale
a
bit
tight
like
mentioned
before
but
still
worthy
of
going
for
so
going
into
this
beer
im
really
wondering
what
to
expect
considering
its
got
such
a
low
abv
but
i
cant
imagine
stone
would
put
something
out
thats
bland
or
typical
for
the
low
abv
it
certainly
is
impressive
a
floral
piney
hop
aroma
not
as
robust
as
ruination
or
such
but
present
and
nice
pours
a
deep
auburn
amber
with
foamy
lighttan
head
looks
like
iced
tea
or
such
taste
is
as
you
may
expect
like
a
lighter
verysion
of
their
ipa
its
not
thin
by
any
means
just
lighter
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
deep
ambertype
base
mouth
feels
quite
light
the
mouth
and
drinkability
are
like
a
light
beer
sort
of
but
just
with
a
decent
hop
character
i
suppose
the
high
price
tage
for
a
beer
at
4
5
abv
no
less
takes
off
from
its
drinkability
for
some
but
im
not
factoring
that
in
drinkability
the
levitations
highest
praise
this
stuff
is
eminently
drinkable
with
only
4
4
percent
alcohol
this
is
the
type
of
big
flavored
but
still
solidly
sessionable
beer
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
from
stone
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
watery
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
after
such
a
stellar
opening
d
all
day
long
a
great
intro
beer
for
macro
drinkers
i
was
impressed
by
what
stone
did
with
the
style
and
the
lack
of
abv
on
this
beer
overall
good
drinkability
nice
refreshing
beer
not
much
going
on
but
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
the
bitterness
plays
well
with
the
roasted
malt
and
slight
sweetness
from
the
malts
maybe
the
name
levitation
ale
has
something
to
do
with
the
light
body
maybe
not
but
it
sounds
like
it
could
work
fairly
dry
finish
with
a
lingering
piney
bitterness
extremely
drinkable
i
found
a
sessionable
stone
who
knew
it
may
not
appeal
to
extreme
beer
lovers
but
im
really
enjoying
it
it
certainly
is
a
tamed
down
offering
from
stone
but
is
still
a
very
fine
beer
something
i
can
truly
enjoy
several
of
without
getting
totally
rocked
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
just
like
with
most
of
stones
beers
despite
the
slight
strategic
mishap
with
this
beer
its
very
quaffable
very
nice
beer
thanks
to
brandonbaer
for
this
one
drinkability
a
good
session
brew
from
stone
will
try
again
cheers
d
a
destinedtobeclassic
session
beer
for
me
this
brew
has
the
same
characteristics
of
an
arrogant
bastard
just
to
a
lesser
extent
it
pours
a
deep
copperbrownish
color
the
scent
of
toasted
malts
and
earthy
hops
stand
out
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
acts
accordingly
with
the
scents
that
i
detected
lighter
bodied
but
carbonated
and
smooth
finishes
crisp
and
hoppy
this
is
basically
a
sessionable
arrogant
bastard
at
4
4
abv
that
you
could
drink
right
out
of
the
bottle
and
not
feel
the
least
bit
bad
about
it
you
could
also
drink
a
whole
6
pack
of
it
and
not
be
totally
hammer
faced
a
solid
brew
light
body
average
carbonation
nice
easy
drinker
good
beginer
beer
but
id
still
recommend
this
to
the
expert
good
beer
drinkability
well
its
definitely
a
hopforward
west
coast
amber
personally
id
have
preferred
more
well
any
malt
sweetness
to
temper
the
hop
character
however
the
4
4
abv
is
most
appreciated
pours
a
hazy
brown
copper
color
with
a
small
yet
dense
khaki
colored
head
the
aroma
is
fantastic
nice
juicy
hops
grapefruit
fresh
pine
with
hints
of
honey
or
caramel
beauty
more
of
a
bittery
resiny
hop
in
the
flavor
some
grapefruit
a
weakish
caramel
malt
struggles
to
support
the
bitter
hop
flavor
the
body
feels
a
bit
thin
almost
watery
i
was
expecting
a
bigger
body
but
at
4
4abv
i
guess
that
is
a
trade
off
the
carbonation
is
on
the
softer
side
finishes
a
tad
bitter
a
fantastic
smelling
brew
that
slides
in
taste
and
feel
i
appreciate
the
low
abv
but
this
could
use
a
bit
more
of
a
malt
presence
pretty
good
beer
but
a
bit
too
much
hop
flavor
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
its
a
good
session
beer
for
people
that
love
a
ton
of
hops
but
are
looking
for
something
lighter
to
drink
a
lot
of
overall
impression
im
glad
this
beer
finally
arrived
in
indiana
i
really
enjoy
how
easy
it
it
is
to
drink
while
still
maintaining
the
complexity
and
uniqueness
of
a
stone
brew
however
i
do
admit
that
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
is
getting
a
bit
tiresome
as
i
finish
the
pint
its
a
good
brew
but
not
in
the
realm
of
a
light
session
pale
ale
like
pride
and
joy
this
beer
poured
copper
with
a
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
mostly
hops
with
some
grassiness
and
floral
character
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
bready
malt
that
gives
way
to
some
citrusy
and
piney
hops
with
a
pretty
decent
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
reasonably
complex
beer
that
happens
to
be
quite
a
bit
less
daunting
than
some
of
stones
other
offerings
i
good
one
to
try
if
you
dont
want
something
that
will
consume
your
whole
night
this
one
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
yet
somehow
is
very
light
and
drinkable
well
done
the
one
word
id
use
to
describe
stones
levitation
impressive
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
in
an
ale
with
only
4
4
abv
yes
after
tasting
this
the
first
time
i
couldnt
believe
its
only
4
4
nice
nose
and
aroma
excllent
taste
with
undercurrents
of
nut
and
slight
fruit
now
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
just
not
possible
with
a
low
abv
but
for
what
you
get
and
dont
get
with
levitation
this
one
is
a
definite
keeper
the
one
to
have
when
you
want
the
taste
but
not
the
alcohol
very
drinkable
wellbalanced
finishes
well
no
problem
enjoying
an
entire
6
pack
with
ease
d
super
easy
going
down
due
to
the
low
abv
or
at
least
low
by
stone
standards
edit
ill
admit
i
tweaked
the
numbers
upon
a
postreview
looking
at
scores
ive
given
recently
i
realized
that
my
review
for
this
beer
placed
it
well
above
a
beer
i
liked
as
much
if
not
better
the
numbers
reflect
my
thinking
while
previous
numbers
were
more
goodbeer
mainstays
that
i
am
trying
to
shy
away
from
d
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
which
is
what
stone
was
going
for
not
bad
but
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
good
beer
to
drink
with
friends
who
arent
into
the
craft
beer
scene
d
overall
a
very
nice
beer
average
in
some
ways
but
above
average
in
some
others
for
instance
drinkability
the
extra
1
or
2
alcohol
this
baby
lacks
is
made
up
for
by
the
fact
that
you
can
actually
have
a
session
with
some
delicious
hoppy
beer
without
gettin
shitfaced
as
quickly
put
it
in
the
pub
nice
to
have
another
tasty
low
abv
option
this
one
from
stone
is
just
the
ticket
for
an
afternoon
beer
when
youve
still
got
something
to
do
pours
reddish
dark
amber
with
a
slight
head
smells
dry
light
and
spicy
with
hops
clean
and
pine
scented
with
very
little
malt
sweetness
almost
austere
the
taste
is
similar
quite
light
and
clean
and
surprisingly
bitter
and
dry
lean
and
quenching
with
an
herbal
piney
finish
nice
d
very
very
drinkable
due
to
low
alcohol
content
and
nothing
overwhelming
to
the
palate
good
entrylevel
beer
for
stone
another
solid
offering
from
stone
one
of
my
favorite
amber
ales
this
one
went
down
really
easy
the
bitterness
was
something
that
caught
me
off
guard
but
as
you
start
to
get
thru
the
pint
you
realize
it
is
nothing
to
get
hung
up
on
im
not
doing
backflips
about
this
one
but
i
did
really
enjoy
it
glad
it
is
available
out
here
in
6ers
i
might
stock
a
couple
thanks
for
reading
theres
not
much
i
can
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
been
said
i
used
to
drink
this
all
the
time
havent
had
it
on
5
plus
years
now
i
remember
why
stone
rules
and
this
beer
kicks
ass
just
a
good
red
ale
with
a
solid
hop
taste
and
smell
makes
you
burp
hops
good
on
ya
stone
drinkability
does
this
mean
its
also
lower
calorie
since
its
only
4
4
if
so
thats
a
bonus
because
i
wouldve
easily
said
without
knowing
that
this
was
in
the
6
range
i
imagine
ill
be
drinking
more
of
these
this
summer
itd
probably
go
great
with
some
barbeque
also
stone
continues
to
brew
great
stuff
not
that
that
surprises
me
nicely
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
but
didnt
live
up
to
what
i
had
hoped
overall
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
from
the
boys
at
stone
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
a
good
drinkable
amber
ale
this
is
a
very
drinkable
amber
and
they
certainly
crammed
plenty
of
hops
into
a
fairly
light
beer
very
good

the
aroma
and
flavor
to
this
one
are
very
nice
but
very
much
muted
compared
to
stones
usual
this
is
simply
a
pure
brew
and
as
natural
as
it
gets
with
its
low
abv
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
without
a
doubt
the
most
fullflavored
complex
ale
i
have
had
at
only
4
4
abv
there
is
no
watery
flavor
here
i
now
understand
the
name
of
the
ale
as
the
back
label
states
an
ale
with
this
complexity
does
defy
gravity
deasy
to
drink
lighter
alcohol
heightens
drinkability
a
little
to
sweet
to
knock
back
many
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
stone
selection
i
get
the
taste
without
feeling
like
i
am
trying
to
prove
something
i
am
writing
a
paper
for
college
and
thought
i
would
start
with
a
review
to
help
get
the
neurons
firing
this
ale
poored
smooth
with
a
thick
foamy
head
of
about
an
inch
and
a
half
that
never
fully
disapated
but
melted
down
to
a
skim
on
top
the
colour
is
an
amber
tone
the
smell
is
very
nice
not
to
over
the
top
the
taste
is
the
same
rolling
over
the
toungue
with
out
to
much
bitterness
but
hitting
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
bite
there
is
a
definate
earthy
taste
that
i
have
come
to
appreciate
from
all
of
stones
selections
i
rated
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
as
high
because
for
the
amount
of
taste
you
get
out
of
this
beer
its
not
filling
i
recomend
this
ale
d
if
you
like
the
flavor
youd
probably
down
many
but
unfortunately
i
dont
drinkability
lots
of
hops
and
flavor
overall
wellbalanced
focused
and
clean
highly
drinkable
color
is
a
very
rich
redamber
when
poured
out
has
a
nice
foamy
head
that
stick
around
for
a
while
decent
lacing
as
well
drips
down
fairly
quickly
some
moderate
carbonation
visible
this
beer
also
has
a
great
citrusgrain
smell
to
it
the
guy
below
me
made
an
excellent
observation
of
a
grapefruit
taste
not
my
favorite
stone
brew
but
great
to
have
for
a
meal
or
just
hanging
around
drinkability
very
high
great
taste
and
low
abv
make
a
good
combo
and
its
really
good
with
just
about
any
kind
of
food
d
i
couldnt
imagine
a
better
beer
after
a
day
of
snowboarding
its
crisp
and
refreshing
but
still
complex
enough
that
its
not
boring
i
wish
i
could
find
this
back
home
it
would
be
a
great
golfingsummer
beer
too
woo
hoo
i
found
a
stone
beer
i
like
d
i
never
thought
id
criticize
a
beer
for
being
overhopped
but
the
lack
of
balance
between
the
flavor
and
bittering
hops
hurts
this
one
despite
the
low
abv
overall
a
good
representation
of
a
style
that
is
not
my
favourite
try
it
youll
probably
like
it
leaves
a
very
nice
aftertaste
and
its
just
so
chewy
its
nice
to
see
another
beer
from
stone
that
doesnt
blow
you
out
of
the
water
d
overall
a
solid
beer
that
may
lack
just
slighly
in
complexity
packed
full
of
flavor
and
easily
my
favorite
light
beer
levitation
ale
is
very
good
beer
it
has
stone
written
all
over
it
its
not
quite
the
stunner
that
some
of
their
beer
is
but
for
a
4
4
beer
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
a
ton
of
character
i
think
it
needs
a
little
more
of
something
to
improve
the
flavor
a
little
perhaps
a
little
more
of
a
sweet
flavor
all
in
all
though
its
pretty
impressive
easily
recommended
im
pleased
to
finally
see
the
bottles
in
ohio
but
i
recall
liking
this
on
draft
a
little
better
notes
levitation
ale
is
a
straightforward
fullflavored
wellhopped
amber
ale
that
left
me
satisfied
nothing
special
here
just
a
very
good
session
beer
that
i
would
love
to
drink
all
night
another
winner
for
stone
brewing
this
isnt
my
favorite
brew
but
it
isnt
bad
by
any
means
just
could
have
been
better
balanced
and
more
drinkable
especially
considering
the
style
i
felt
it
was
over
hopped
and
did
not
allow
me
to
taste
the
other
complexities
in
the
beer
i
would
have
an
ipa
if
i
wanted
a
hoppy
brew
stones
own
ipa
is
quite
a
bit
better
than
this
one
anyway
future
outlook
a
very
decent
flavorful
low
abv
brew
that
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
pounding
bmc
on
a
night
of
mindless
drinking
not
that
i
have
many
of
these
anymore
i
could
see
getting
this
again
for
just
such
an
occasion
exceedingly
drinkable
a
session
beer
for
the
hop
lover
big
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
and
low
alcohol
this
is
a
hoppier
if
not
the
hoppiest
version
of
an
amberred
i
find
it
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
light
and
clean
but
the
bitter
finish
hurts
the
refeshing
quality
d
even
though
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
id
drink
it
as
a
session
beer
to
replace
those
foul
tasting
macros
it
was
pretty
easy
drinking
and
though
the
flavor
wasnt
that
offputting
it
got
low
marks
because
it
did
not
seem
like
an
amber
ale
at
all
it
seemed
more
like
a
stone
attempt
at
a
macro
style
beer
the
only
possible
way
that
this
beer
got
a
gold
at
the
great
american
beer
festival
would
be
if
no
other
beers
entered
in
its
category
stones
beer
continue
to
disappoint
me
this
is
a
great
everyday
drinker
i
cant
say
that
im
not
a
little
shocked
to
see
this
from
stone
but
way
to
go
finally
a
session
beer
from
these
guys
not
my
cup
o
tea
light
beer
feel
with
super
strong
hop
flavors
overall
a
bit
disappointing
if
you
are
expecting
the
usual
stone
bitchslap
to
the
taste
buds
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
at
4
4abv
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
fairly
light
body
the
pine
tar
nature
of
the
hops
makes
the
flavors
stick
in
my
mouth
and
makes
the
beer
seem
bigger
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
could
see
tacking
some
of
these
into
a
series
of
sessionable
beers
drinkability
kind
of
mediocre
when
it
comes
to
stone
but
overall
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
in
the
future
but
i
really
dont
mind
drinking
it
the
low
abv
would
easily
allow
for
a
fair
amount
to
be
consumed
in
a
sitting
so
easily
sessionable
12

served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
halfinch
offwhite
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
average
it
smells
like
piney
and
grassy
hops
along
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
pine
and
grassy
hops
with
a
bit
of
malt
theres
also
a
nice
lingering
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
oily
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
think
its
a
decent
choice
as
a
session
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
of
this
beer
at
first
a
stone
beer
at
just
4
4
abv
the
flavor
is
good
and
its
easy
to
drink
so
thats
definitely
a
good
thing
but
for
the
price
i
dont
think
im
getting
my
moneys
worth
with
that
being
said
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
very
often
i
was
going
to
save
my
hoppy
beer
for
the
finale
tonight
guess
it
sneaked
on
me
early
clearly
stone
is
a
good
go
to
for
delivery
of
the
ol
alpha
acid
but
i
have
to
say
if
i
would
want
it
in
every
beer
i
would
always
order
a
ruination
d
has
a
good
amount
of
bold
flavours
even
with
the
lower
abv
very
easy
to
drink
good
session
brew
drinkability
actually
this
is
a
little
too
flavorful
for
extended
sessioning
in
my
book
but
a
fantastic
option
after
some
extended
sampling
when
you
want
something
that
can
hold
its
own
tastewise
after
some
prior
potentbigger
brews

congrats
to
president
obama
and
his
cabinet
pours
deep
russet
quite
clear
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
pine
moss
and
toffee
the
taste
is
eucalyptus
leatherwood
honey
smoke
and
tangelo
very
complex
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
finely
carbonated
but
robust
with
a
medium
body
its
powerful
for
such
lowalcohol
beer
but
the
drinking
is
rich
full
and
easy
i
am
loving
the
low
abv
on
this
beer
but
the
price
tag
9
49
per
sixpack
is
a
deterrent
for
me
its
like
a
solid
ipa
in
the
beginning
and
end
feeling
like
an
amstel
light
strange
but
drinkable
this
smooth
easier
drinking
stone
could
be
the
most
sessional
hoppy
beer
ive
tried
though
i
dont
know
if
id
session
a
hoppy
beer
but
if
im
ever
in
the
mood
this
would
be
a
treat
all
in
all
great
beer
that
just
misses
being
exceptional
notes
not
one
of
the
most
complex
or
full
flavored
beers
from
stone
but
certainly
one
of
my
favorites
the
taste
packed
into
this
4
4
brew
is
what
really
sells
it
very
drinkable
it
is
the
quintessential
session
brew
in
my
book
pours
a
pretty
clear
reddishbrown
colored
body
with
a
offwhite
light
brown
soapy
head
small
but
lasting
citrusy
aroma
hoppy
dusty
malty
maybe
some
hoppiness
watery
palate
dusty
hoppy
taste
light
on
the
harsh
carbonated
taste
just
like
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
this
beer
shows
the
brilliance
of
the
craft
beer
movement
a
crisp
flavorful
and
versatile
session
beer
i
would
love
to
see
this
become
their
flagship
session
beer
and
available
nationally
fans
of
the
style
will
enjoy
this
but
i
dont
find
it
particularly
accessible
tap
the
stone
beer
garden
they
offer
this
from
time
to
time
pours
dark
brown
with
a
short
offwhite
head
drier
malt
aroma
but
now
with
the
chinooks
toasted
hop
flavor
new
that
gives
it
an
ashydry
flavor
biscuity
malthop
mix
dry
clean
finish
overall
a
decent
enough
amber
ale
not
something
id
rush
back
to
but
certainly
worth
a
try
d
i
really
like
this
beer
for
a
buy
a
sixer
on
the
way
home
beer
im
very
glad
i
bought
this
single
recommended
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
honestly
prefer
the
other
offerings
from
stone
such
as
their
arrogant
bastard
and
smoked
porter
the
levitation
ale
however
is
a
good
session
beer
if
you
want
good
flavor
without
the
high
alcohol
found
in
stones
other
brews
and
since
this
was
tasted
from
the
obf
sample
mug
further
research
is
required
d
fantastic
drinkability
here
which
is
exactly
what
this
beer
was
designed
for
plenty
of
flavor
and
only
4
4
abv
this
beer
is
different
from
anything
else
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
good
dbeing
4

i
have
to
give
this
brew
some
props
i
am
a
sucker
for
low
abv
beers
that
pack
in
flavour
to
me
that
is
what
beer
is
about
flavour
not
abv
if
you
are
looking
for
ab
light
so
you
can
kick
more
than
a
few
back
during
an
evening
look
no
more
feel
the
quaffable
lightness
of
levitation
holmes
bottle
bought
in
grand
junction
colorado
at
college
liquors
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
a
nice
aggressive
aroma
of
rich
bitter
hops
and
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
quite
nice
smooth
and
rich
caramel
malts
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
lightly
bitter
some
biscuit
and
grapefruit
flavors
also
very
quaffable
and
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
frothy
head
slight
floral
smell
would
soon
reveal
itself
in
a
subdued
sharp
floral
hoppiness
some
carbonation
gives
it
crispness
have
to
imagine
this
is
a
toned
down
version
of
an
over
hopped
stone
offering
it
works
well
as
a
warm
up
session
beer
or
beer
that
goes
with
just
about
any
food
but
a
bit
thin
to
be
a
standout
brew

earlier
tonight
into

i
am
updating
my
rating
of
the
appearance

it
cannot
be
improved
upon
it

a
great
looking

and
the
coolest

of
like
a
sugary
coating
i
previously
had
it
at

i
am
upgrading
my
3
5
for
smell
to
a
4
5
for
the
balanced
complexity
of
the
nose
of
this
beer
it
smells
inviting
and
interesting
i
am
upgrading
the
taste
from
a
4
0
to
a
4
5
since
this
is
a
really
nicely
balanced
beer
with
a
hops
kick
not
the
hops
centric
beer
that
it
sounds
like
i
describe
above
i
am
upgrading
the
mouthfeel
from
3
0
to
4
0
since
this
is
a
big
almost
sugary
balanced
beer
with
plenty
going
on
to
keep
my
interest
drinkability
is
at
least
a
4
0
up
from
a
3
5
due
to
low
abv
and
an
interesting
profile
complex
tastes
notes
great
beer
from
stone
might
be
my
favorite
huge
drinkability
here
the
4
4
abv
makes
this
one
of
the
best
tasting
lower
abv
brews
ive
had
in
a
long
time
huge
props
to
stone
for
making
a
great
session
brew
cheers
overall
a
really
nice
beer
a
ton
of
flavor
for
a
sixer
and
one
of
the
more
approachable
stone
offerings
that
being
said
i
miss
the
increased
abv
and
the
accompanying
flavor
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
a
little
more
oomph
and
it
could
be
a
classic
but
i
guess
that
would
make
it
a
whole
other
beer
ive
always
been
a
huge
fan
of
stone
beer
and
ive
desperately
wanted
to
try
this
as
they
dont
send
it
to
kentucky
or
anywhere
out
east
after
trying
this
i
must
say
this
beer
needs
to
make
it
out
here
it
may
not
be
their
best
beer
but
it
is
the
craft
drinkers
light
beer
only
without
that
terrible
stigma
that
the
macros
have
created
now
just
dont
tell
greg
i
said
it
he
already
chewed
me
out
for
it
twice
the
beer
poured
a
deep
reddishamber
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
of
fresh
piney
hops
reminiscent
of
a
sierra
nevada
ipa
the
taste
had
loads
of
hop
bitterness
surprising
for
such
a
light
abv
beer
by
stones
standards
anyway
which
was
fine
for
a
hophead
like
myself
there
was
also
malt
sweetness
of
course
but
the
hop
profile
really
stands
out
and
lasted
long
after
the
last
swallow
very
nice
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
one
in
the
levitations
defense
its
a
really
good
beer
by
itself
i
however
was
expecting
something
different
to
me
it
tasted
like
a
toned
down
version
of
bastard
not
a
bad
thing
if
thats
what
you
want
but
like
i
said
i
was
hoping
for
something
unique
d
extremely
sessionable
eric
drinkability
more
bitter
than
the
typical
amber
but
i
like
it
flavor
is
pretty
complex
yet
not
overpowering
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
not
one
of
my
favorite
stone
offerings
although
clearly
a
good
beer
if
im
going
to
get
a
strong
beer
flavor
like
this
then
i
want
the
accompanying
head
change
just
greedy
i
guess
after
a
great
amber
from
bear
republic
i
had
to
try
another
and
thought
to
try
my
favorite
brewery
stone
this
is
new
to
vegas
and
i
was
excited
to
try
pours
a
clear
amber
with
an
offwhite
creamy
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
good
some
caramel
but
a
nice
hops
presence
as
well
taste
is
on
par
with
the
smell
although
theres
not
a
much
malt
as
id
expect
from
this
style
it
was
still
great
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
good
hops
kick
at
the
end
overall
i
think
this
could
pass
in
most
circles
as
a
pale
ale
or
english
ipa
nice
light
body
to
it
as
well
not
too
light
though
overall
very
drinkable
the
low
abv
and
smooth
taste
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
definitely
sessionable
has
the
stone
signature
on
it
so
will
be
more
drinkable
than
most
in
the
style
super
drinkable
great
session
beer
i
drank
half
the
6
pack
last
night
while
tailgating
on
location
at
the
chargers
vs
cowboys
game
highly
recommended
great
stone
intro
beer
o
stone
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
however
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
mild
side
of
stone
brews
still
a
great
beer
though
very
easy
to
drink
and
with
the
reasonable
alcohol
content
easy
to
pound
back
a
few
recieved
this
in
a
trade
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
had
to
date
others
that
i
have
tried
left
me
wanting
this
beer
comes
through
with
a
nice
beginning
middle
and
end
strong
enough
to
let
its
presence
know
but
also
smooth
enough
to
not
have
any
one
taste
command
the
whole
thing
drinkability
decent
but
in
my
opinion
a
little
onedimensional
maybe
im
being
unfair
as
its
not
really
my
style
still
definitely
worth
a
try
one
of
stones
most
awardwinning
beers
if
im
not
mistaken
this
one
is
good
its
not
as
strong
as
its
cousans
arregant
basterd
or
ruinnation
ipa
but
it
holdes
its
own
it
is
nice
to
have
this
amber
bitter
brew
this
one
is
for
everyday
consumption
with
out
having
to
worry
about
the
abv
this
is
a
beautifull
blance
form
start
to
finish
with
the
hop
blast
that
i
expext
from
stone
at
the
end
get
this
one
and
you
wont
be
dissapointed
d
drinkability
increases
as
the
ale
warms
take
time
to
sip
and
youll
be
rewarded
for
your
patience
well
recommended
especially
for
the
hot
summer
months
this
brew
chilled
would
be
a
very
refreshing
treat
during
the
day
ive
not
been
much
of
a
fan
of
stones
big
beers
their
large
alcohol
presence
and
sweetness
tend
to
be
just
too
much
for
my
tastes
however
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
d
very
good
especially
for
a
lower
abv
beer
dvery
good
a
nice
complex
beer
that
you
can
drink
in
reasonable
quantity
d
i
think
that
i
have
known
about
this
beer
for
a
longtime
but
have
just
overlooked
it
interestingly
enough
this
isnt
stones
usual
aggressive
beer
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
my
next
growler
will
be
this
guy
thanks
to
david
h
for
bringing
this
beer
back
from
the
brewery
i
have
longly
anticipated
this
brew
it
comes
as
a
surprise
to
me
what
im
about
to
experience
this
increadible
beer
begins
with
a
deep
amber
nearly
brown
hue
with
creamy
offwhite
head
formation
retains
very
well
and
leaves
lacing
all
over
the
place
modest
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
cask
alelike
demeanor
sharp
aromas
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
promises
agression
while
very
light
notes
of
nuts
toast
and
cocoa
tells
me
that
the
beer
isnt
only
hops
the
taste
of
the
hops
hit
up
front
with
a
juicy
burst
citurs
then
pine
after
the
hops
die
down
a
bit
the
dry
toast
chesnut
and
light
cocoa
powder
flavors
come
in
interestingly
there
are
no
real
sweetness
to
this
beer
it
has
fully
attenuated
so
that
only
the
dry
malt
hops
and
fermentation
character
shows
the
mouthfeel
is
both
creamy
and
dry
making
it
very
drinkable
albeit
bitter
finishes
with
a
crisp
bitterness
part
from
hops
but
part
from
toast
and
nuttiness
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
character
for
a
4
4
sessionable
bonedry
beer
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
a
bit
of
sweetness
would
have
scored
it
higher
looks
impressive
a
nice
dark
amber
almost
ruby
color
smells
mostly
of
hops
with
some
fruity
citrus
notes
taste
was
very
good
much
like
the
aroma
mostly
hops
with
some
orangy
citrus
flavor
nice
bitter
finish
i
like
to
have
a
6
pack
of
this
in
the
fridge
most
of
the
time
one
of
my
everyday
beers
i
like
it
a
lot
t
m
d
a
similar
profile
to
the
aroma
grapefruit
flavours
in
the
hops
with
a
touch
of
pine
or
spruce
a
soft
malt
backbone
provides
a
nice
rounding
to
the
overall
body
and
flavour
a
lighter
more
accessable
flavour
and
feeling
that
makes
this
a
very
approachable
easy
to
drink
friendly
beer
at
a
tame
4
4
it
would
certainly
be
a
session
candidate
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
with
good
solid
carbonation
overall
a
very
attractive
and
drinkable
amber
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
but
rather
watery
due
to
the
aforementioned
lack
of
a
solid
maltiness
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
sessionable
option
from
stone
wow
i
forgot
how
interesting
this
beer
is
there
are
some
really
odd
but
pleasant
herbal
garden
hops
notes
with
the
citrus
that
remind
me
of
surlys
bitter
brewer
again
of
course
the
malt
is
a
significantly
darker
here
adding
a
light
roasty
finish
in
with
the
juicy
hops
heck
of
a
beer
sweet
malty
fruity
backing
with
a
assertive
hip
of
the
citrus
the
nose
has
shown
mouth
is
oddly
thin
and
hurts
things
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
amber
ale
with
a
great
resiny
refreshing
hop
approach
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
looks
like
it
will
never
go
away
it
leaves
thick
laces
it
smells
like
citrus
and
maybe
flowers
it
smelled
hoppy
but
not
too
over
the
top
it
tastes
slightly
malty
it
has
a
spicy
floral
taste
it
is
lightly
carbonated
it
is
smooth
the
taste
lingers
im
my
mouth
this
beer
can
go
all
night
long
chewy
it
is
very
low
in
alcohol
content
so
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
them
but
the
abv
tasted
more
than
it
was
perhaps
because
it
was
so
full
bodied
it
is
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
not
an
amber
fan
but
this
was
pretty
dam
good
a
nice
beer
for
sure
but
it
could
use
a
tad
more
residual
sweetness
it
was
worth
seeking
out
this
one
time
but
id
probably
go
for
stones
other
offerings
on
a
regular
basis
kevin

pours
a
deep
transluscent
maroon
with
a

is
big
sweet

equally
matched
however
by
a
nice
blast
of
fresh
fruity
hoppiness
similar
smell
to
a
nice
ipa
very
nicely
balanced
sweet

and
hop
flavor
for
an

nice
rich

great
flavor

well

good
very
drinkable
and
recommended
for
sure
even
for
non
amber
fans
medium
body
smooth
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
as
close
to
a
session
beer
as
you
will
get
from
stone
i
guess
pretty
nice
overall
impression
a
balanced
sessionable
american
ale
seems
tame
for
a
west
coast
amber
however
this
is
highly
poundable
inspires
me
to
try
to
clone
an
interesting
quaffer
like
this
recommended
initial
burst
of
malty
floral
and
hoppy
aroma
that
became
more
subtle
after
a
few
seconds
and
included
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
clear
amberbrown
color
with
frothy
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
minimal
head
fairly
quickly
malty
roasted
flavors
with
some
floral
hop
character
and
slight
caramel
with
each
sip
there
was
a
powerful
spike
of
bitterness
that
only
lasted
a
second
and
settled
into
a
pretty
well
balanced
flavor
medium
carbonation
mediumbodied
d
flavor
gets
a
little
bit
fatiguing
but
i
could
polish
a
sixer
easy
nice
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
aromas
of
flowers
pine
malt
and
honey
pours
with
a
very
small
head
that
goes
initial
flavor
is
of
honey
and
sweetened
tea
followed
by
malt
and
pine
does
taste
a
bit
watered
down
medium
but
watery
textured
body
with
soft
carbonation
very
nice
for
something
that
can
legally
in
the
u
s
be
called
a
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
some
bitter
and
toasty
aftertaste
but
then
again
this
is
meant
to
be
a
session
beer
so
one
should
not
expect
a
big
and
heavy
mouthfeel
goes
down
very
smooth
and
leaves
a
slight
dryness
on
the
palate
which
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
a
very
decent
session
beer
d
if
you
like
hops
but
arent
quite
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
this
is
your
beer
if
you
dont
like
hoppy
beers
look
elsewhere
i
found
this
quite
drinkable
and
would
buy
it
again
enjoyed
courtesy
of
barefootbrewer
poured
a
nice
dark
ambercopper
color
with
nice
white
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
flavor
is
also
of
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
coming
through
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
amber
ale
with
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
mouth
feel
was
good
and
lacing
on
glass
was
light
overall
nice
hoppy
brew
that
is
so
easy
drinking
i
love
stone
and
if
i
could
get
this
one
by
the
sixer
i
would
pound
em
down
all
summer
long
im
beginning
to
believe
stone
dont
make
a
single
bad
beer
md
a
light
semiwatered
down
body
carbonation
is
a
little
high
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
one
as
it
is
low
abv
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
go
down
this
amber
ale
really
showcases
the
hops
not
in
a
ipa
way
but
they
are
here
in
numbers
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
maltiness
but
it
is
not
bad
another
great
beer
from
stone
smell
is
nice
hops
and
evergreen
a
touch
of
malts
taste
is
of
hops
as
well
nice
hints
of
citrus
finishes
quite
well
very
smooth
pretty
nice
brew
i
want
another
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
stone
somewhat
raw
root
beer
brown
in
color
with
a
quarter
inch
beige
head
a
rich
smell
of
hops
with
hints
of
a
sweet
malty
aroma
definately
can
not
mistaken
the
hops
in
this
beer
a
smooth
finish
compared
to
the
initial
hit
of
hops
on
the
palate
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
comes
with
the
usual
quality
that
stone
puts
into
their
beers
i
also
find
that
i
sit
and
end
up
concentrating
more
on
the
beer
than
writing
my
comments
edit
finished
the
glass
with
some
cheap
chocolate
chip
cookies
the
chocolate
was
a
good
pairing
with
the
bitterness
and
the
sugar
made
the
dryness
more
enjoyable
thanks
to
mmmmbeeeer
for
sharing
a
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
medium
foamy
offwhite
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
small
patches
of
lacing
piney
hops
along
with
caramel
and
malt
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
with
hops
toasted
malt
and
grapefruit
flavors
the
finish
is
balanced
between
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malt
leaving
a
roasted
malt
aftertaste
interesting
take
on
an
amber
ale
leave
it
to
stone
to
put
a
spin
on
it
like
this
overall
its
not
necessarily
something
i
would
try
again
but
its
a
decent
session
beer
d
this
could
be
a
session
if
one
remembered
to
eat
to
make
sure
the
taste
buds
are
intact
sidenote
roxy
rolles
from
magic
hat
is
a
much
better
example
of
a
hoppy
amber
ale
i
think
itd
be
interesting
to
trade
some
roxy
rolles
to
a
west
coaster
that
really
likes
this
brew
and
see
what
they
think
d
outstanding
the
ridiculously
dry
finish
could
be
a
bit
taxing
for
a
long
session
but
i
could
definitely
drink
two
or
three
of
these
with
some
tangy
ribs
or
spicy
brats
this
is
a
brew
that
is
drinkable
and
can
also
stand
up
to
some
really
spicy
food
this
is
hoppier
than
many
ipas
yet
its
listed
as
a
red
ale
poured
a
nice
rich
carmal
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
head
it
has
a
nice
aroma
of
hops
honestly
i
think
its
a
little
off
balance
the
beer
is
really
hoppy
but
i
think
needs
more
of
a
malt
backbone
to
balance
the
beer
the
bitterness
is
a
little
much
but
it
does
not
affect
its
drinkability
this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
brownamber
color
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
initially
of
fresh
hops
followed
by
a
sweet
caramel
smell
the
taste
is
bitter
but
not
overbearing
from
the
hops
it
is
definitely
full
of
flavor
but
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
sweetness
for
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
more
than
medium
bodied
and
seems
quite
appropriate
for
this
brew
overall
im
enjoying
drinking
this
beer
but
the
bitterness
needs
could
use
a
little
more
malt
backbone
want
to
try
this
on
tap
soon
drinkability
this
has
to
be
the
premier
american
session
beer
it
manages
to
be
low
abv
and
super
drinkable
without
sacrificing
hop
bitterness
or
a
solid
malt
backbone
good
work
stone
thanks
for
not
pussyfooting
around
with
this
style
like
so
many
other
breweries
have
d
taste
is
decent
and
full
but
not
excellent
this
is
one
i
would
probably
resist
buying
again
it
is
just
not
as
intense
as
most
of
their
portfolio
it
is
a
tasty
ale
though
and
very
drinkable
definitely
sessionable
just
not
my
taste
i
guess
this
went
well
w
my
teriyaki
salmon
ah
an
amber
that
smells
tastes
and
looks
like
an
ipa
this
basically
is
an
ipa
with
lower
abv
and
a
bit
less
body
instead
of
a
stone
ipa
with
citrusy
aromas
and
flavors
and
and
golden
color
this
is
more
like
hopdevil
or
something
of
that
sort
great
deep
amber
color
nice
snappy
head
stinky
hop
aroma
sharp
bitter
hop
bite
good
mouthfeel
excellent
drinkability
a
bit
rougher
than
the
stone
ipa
like
a
brasher
and
more
unpredictable
younger
brother
high
ibus
with
low
abv
makes
this
a
hopheads
session
ale
i
had
not
been
able
to
purchase
this
one
form
stone
before
what
a
shame
there
was
a
great
color
and
body
to
this
brew
lighter
brownish
red
with
aromas
of
caramel
malts
some
unripe
fruits
and
extremely
clean
hops
i
love
stones
hops
theyre
very
unique
among
all
of
the
other
hopbomb
breweries
flavor
was
light
and
subtle
raw
leaf
hops
citrus
and
piney
so
fresh
i
feel
like
im
eating
them
straight
off
the
plant
there
is
some
malt
there
to
balance
everything
out
but
it
definitely
plays
second
to
the
hops
very
reminiscent
of
their
stronger
brews
but
this
one
leaves
your
taste
buds
intact
and
with
a
lower
abv
you
can
drink
more
than
a
couple
ill
be
purchasing
this
one
as
goto
from
now
on
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
with
good
carbonation
oily
slick
coats
my
tongue
easy
to
drink
brew
but
i
dont
feel
that
this
one
measures
up
to
the
stone
offerings
maybe
this
is
intended
to
be
their
gateway
beer
and
if
it
is
i
can
understand
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
this
might
not
be
the
kind
of
xtreme
beer
that
most
people
would
award
a
high
score
to
but
it
is
so
amazingly
crafted
that
i
have
no
choice
but
it
give
it
a
great
grade
for
the
chance
for
my
ba
annv
ba
members
are
top
notch
the
hops
come
screaming
through
til
late
in
the
game
finish
is
bitter
but
smooth
and
dry
body
has
good
thickness
even
chewy
with
a
slickness
from
the
alpha
oil
hops
damn
good
american
red
that
brings
enough
hops
to
keep
it
lively
drinkability
this
is
stones
most
sessionable
brew
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
sessionable
beers
ive
had
and
probably
the
most
overlooked
and
underrated
beer
in
the
stone
repertoire
pours
a
clear
brownred
small
off
white
head
forms
some
lace
on
the
glass
settles
to
a
very
thin
ring
smell
is
sweet
perfumy
some
floral
light
pine
not
bad
considering
the
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
light
honey
some
pine
toast
floral
pine
very
light
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
smooth
okay
maybe
expecting
more
from
a
stone
beer
but
its
decent
for
a
mild
the
taste
on
first
sip
is
kind
of
strange
the
initial
flavour
is
rather
empty
of
flavour
kind
of
watery
but
then
thankfully
the
grapefruit
hoppy
goodness
moves
in
near
and
through
the
finish
though
its
at
a
subdued
level
hey
this
is
only
4
4abv
so
i
expected
some
kind
of
reduction
in
what
was
going
to
hit
my
taste
buds
and
it
sure
makes
this
ale
a
good
for
sessioning
candidate
if
the
flavour
thats
there
is
enough
to
please
imho
it
passes
that
test
id
buy
it
again
d
low
in
alcohol
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
choice
but
i
found
myself
really
not
wanting
more
than
one
a
beer
ill
have
to
revisit
at
some
point
though
thanks
boutip
for
studying
what
i
have
not
had
in
our
sixth
trade
citrus
and
4
4
sessioanbilty
appreciated
so
that
i
could
have
a
follow
on
beer
this
one
poured
a
reddish
amber
colour
pretty
clear
with
a
light
beige
head
good
head
retention
with
some
clumpy
lacing
there
was
a
pleasant
caramel
aroma
that
balanced
the
hops
which
were
a
bit
fruity
but
mostly
herbal
grassy
and
woody
solid
bitterness
with
an
herbal
minty
hop
flavour
toasty
malt
gave
a
light
sweetness
and
there
was
some
fruitiness
in
the
background
as
well
nice
balance
mediumlight
body
and
carbonation
quite
refreshing
i
could
see
this
making
a
great
session
beer
its
got
a
nice
flavour
profile
thats
not
overpowering
but
is
still
interesting
enough
for
a
few
pints
ill
start
by
saying
that
i
am
a
fan
of
stone
not
this
stone
wonderfully
striking
in
the
glass
nice
dark
brown
that
lets
the
light
dance
through
topped
with
a
pale
yellow
head
that
outlasted
the
beer
bravo
then
everything
else
smell
was
soft
and
hop
forward
with
metal
citrus
and
almost
the
smell
of
wet
dirt
just
before
it
becomes
mud
mouthfeel
was
ok
dry
and
lackluster
taste
was
somewhat
of
a
mouthfull
blast
of
hops
on
the
tongue
mellowed
slightly
by
caramel
stale
bread
and
citrus
pretty
bitter
ending
not
hops
bitter
you
ever
spray
stuff
with
bitter
yuck
you
know
to
keep
a
dog
or
cat
from
biting
it
yeah
weird
bitter
anyway
ok
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
bottle
courtesy
of
naven
poured
a
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
limited
retention
aroma
of
light
piney
hops
with
some
caramel
malt
taste
is
somewhat
hoppy
with
some
light
caramel
malt
notes
also
noticeable
body
is
fuller
then
average
with
some
medium
carbonation
i
understand
that
the
brewer
wanted
to
have
a
session
beer
with
limited
alcohol
but
there
also
too
much
limited
taste

not
something
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
saying
about
stone
someday
flavor
is
some
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
that
finish
with
a
crisp
bite
very
easy
to
drink
seems
almost
like
a
mild
ale
not
a
red
ale
easy
session
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
not
a
beer
for
me
disappointed
as
i
am
an
avid
stone
fan
and
this
being
my
first
opportunity
with
the
levitation
ale
while
the
prose
was
sweet
as
ever
the
brew
itself
was
exceedingly
oppressive
strongly
hopped
i
would
hands
down
prefer
ruination
to
levitation
when
it
comes
to
high
hops
from
stone
a
pleasingly
aesthetic
amber
red
in
a
glass
this
one
just
didnt
have
it
in
flavor
to
warrant
another
buy
from
me
anytime
soon
well
never
had
an
amber
ale
like
this
certainly
punches
above
its
weight
and
does
it
well
more
hops
in
this
12oz
bottle
than
most
cases
of
bmc
this
beer
is
the
worst
in
stones
otherwise
excellent
lineup
which
is
unfortunate
because
those
who
try
this
beer
first
may
get
the
wrong
impression
of
this
fine
craft
brewery
it
looks
right
and
the
smell
is
there
with
some
piney
earthy
notes
but
this
beer
falls
flat
on
its
face
when
it
comes
to
taste
frankly
the
taste
is
insipid
at
best
theres
just
nothing
there
except
water
and
metal
and
lots
of
carbonation
maybe
its
the
low
alcohol
but
this
beer
has
no
character
whatsoever
and
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
after
awhile
all
of
stones
ale
taste
about
the
same
this
one
was
no
different
poured
a
medium
dark
brown
with
some
white
foam
the
smell
of
piney
hops
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
the
aroma
as
far
as
the
taste
it
was
average
with
the
tart
piney
flavor
of
the
hops
and
that
was
about
it
not
impressed
just
average
at
best
asshole
this
has
got
to
be
my
favorite
session
beer
and
it
is
perfect
for
poker
night
it
is
orange
in
color
with
a
decent
head
it
smells
hoppy
and
grassy
the
taste
is
grassy
and
delicious
i
cant
believe
it
has
this
much
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
it
also
tastes
a
little
like
bastard
many
thanks
to
mymrngjckt
for
throwing
this
beer
in
as
an
extra
from
our
recent
trade
it
pours
dark
red
into
a
chalice
the
head
that
froms
sits
on
top
of
the
beer
the
whoe
way
through
the
smell
is
crisp
and
sweet
with
caramel
hoppy
and
vanilla
flavors
rising
from
it
in
the
taste
its
bready
mostly
with
a
hoppy
taste
goes
from
start
to
finish
a
hint
of
sugar
cookies
sneaks
into
play
towards
the
end
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
this
beer
goes
down
nice
easy
and
creamy
this
beers
a
little
deeper
in
flavor
than
what
i
expected
from
a
4
4
abv
beer
d
easy
enough
to
drink
if
you
can
stand
the
bitterness
its
not
a
good
hopbitterness
its
just
plain
bitter
i
normally
like
ambers
but
i
will
not
buy
this
again
wayyy
overrated
stone
makes
some
incredible
brews
but
i
am
beginning
to
think
amber
ale
might
be
one
of
the
most
challenging
types
to
make
really
well
this
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
fat
slightly
offwhite
head
that
left
stickylooking
lacing
in
rings
around
the
glass
nose
of
malts
hops
citrus
flowers
and
something
else
i
cannot
quite
get
to
the
hops
dominate
and
so
you
have
to
look
for
everything
else
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
better
than
most
ambers
flavor
is
of
malts
caramels
and
of
course
hops
finishes
smooth
at
only
4
4
you
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
and
enjoy
every
bottle
interesting
and
well
done
the
gargoyle
brings
forth
session
fare
and
it
works
appearance
is
a
rusty
amber
with
considerable
transparency
smell
is
very
potent
for
a
beer
of
diminished
gravity
great
blend
of
caramel
coffee
malts
the
taste
follows
suit
bringing
forth
a
predictable
dose
of
hoppage
and
leaving
a
slightly
unfortunate
aftertaste
of
cold
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
obvious
reasons
but
i
still
really
dig
this
beer
the
complexity
they
managed
to
squeeze
out
of
a
beer
with
4
4
abv
is
pretty
astonishing
they
could
rename
this
beer
unassuming
codependent
bastard
or
maybe
the
bastard
who
loved
me
accomodating
bastard
the
kinder
gentler
bastard
ill
stop
this
now
and
i
apologize
very
tasteful
good
hop
and
malt
balance
a
little
watery
for
a
stone
but
no
doubt
enjoyable
reminds
me
of
a
lite
arrogant
bastard
kinda
sorta
good
beer
for
any
occasion
just
make
sure
you
have
enough
sixers
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
red
and
there
was
a
fair
head
the
smell
is
wonderfull
hops
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
mmm
the
taste
is
smooth
with
just
a
little
bit
of
a
watery
finish
bitter
this
seems
to
flirt
with
pale
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkbility
inviting
as
a
lower
abv
brew
several
of
these
could
be
consumed
easily
this
is
the
shy
nephew
of
an
arrogant
uncle
d
the
closest
that
ive
seen
to
a
session
ale
from
stone
the
malts
are
strong
and
wellrepresented
taking
control
of
the
ale
from
start
to
finish
as
usual
stone
goes
for
an
overthetop
beer
rather
than
an
interesting
beer
id
rather
get
their
pale
ale
and
skip
the
malts
here
that
are
a
bit
too
sweet
this
almost
seems
like
their
pale
ale
with
malts
dumped
in
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
cant
think
of
a
good
reason
to
get
this
again
drinkability
a
somewhat
disappointing
beer
from
stone
not
at
all
undrinkable
but
it
lacks
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
taste
the
smell
seems
to
promise
a
lot
that
just
isnt
followed
up
once
it
is
drunk
decent
but
probably
wont
be
having
this
one
again
this
ale
pours
a
nice
rich
amber
brown
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
rich
in
malts
grains
and
hops
a
bit
earthy
and
treelike
the
taste
has
some
nice
caramel
qualities
to
it
with
a
bit
of
a
piney
bite
and
a
dry
finish
very
tasty
and
it
drinks
quite
soothly
rather
drinkable
and
easy
to
down
a
sixpack
with
friends
cheers
drinkability
not
bad
not
great
most
people
will
like
it
as
long
as
they
dont
have
some
bizaar
averdsion
to
hops
d
not
bad
and
frankly
unique
enough
to
seperate
itself
from
the
pack
the
grainy
aftertaste
doesnt
do
it
for
me
though
never
does
very
good
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
but
a
little
darker
really
nice
deep
orange
color
the
nose
was
great
fairly
hoppy
had
some
citrus
to
it
and
the
usual
floral
aroma
great
ale
from
stone
and
they
made
it
stand
out
much
more
than
other
amber
ales
mos
def
give
it
a
try
many
thanks
to
marvz
and
boolshot
from
the
double
trouble
bif
d
tasty
easydrinking
not
filling
this
one
is
a
good
basic
beer
i
found
this
beer
to
be
good
for
its
simplicity
stone
knows
how
to
knock
you
over
with
their
big
beers
but
with
this
one
they
show
that
they
know
how
to
give
you
something
easy
its
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
stone
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
reddishbrown
expected
something
a
little
clearer
maybe
this
was
dry
hopped
head
isnt
that
big
and
fades
very
quickly
the
smell
is
pretty
pungent
for
an
amber
ale
with
resiny
hops
duh
this
is
stone
its
a
pretty
good
hopped
up
amber
ale
hops
still
dominate
the
added
maltiness
carbonation
and
body
are
medium
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
for
sure
another
winner
from
stone
they
can
do
no
wrong
pours
a
nice
bronze
color
with
some
distinct
red
tones
head
cascades
up
to
a
nice
level
even
with
a
soft
pour
it
drops
to
leave
rings
of
lacing
that
mark
your
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
typical
stone
west
coast
hops
and
ohhhh
so
good
citrus
and
nice
piney
notes
taste
kicks
in
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
balance
the
malt
becomes
more
and
more
prominant
as
you
drink
more
of
this
one
but
the
hops
never
goes
away
taste
becomes
bready
and
earthy
mouthfeel
has
a
perfect
carbonation
level
beer
finishes
with
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
very
nice
beer
of
the
stone
ive
had
only
the
ipa
is
comparable
as
an
every
day
drinker
with
the
low
abv
this
is
my
new
choice
for
drinking
more
than
a
couple
in
a
night
the
body
has
a
mid
feel
but
personally
i
feel
is
light
for
style
not
bad
but
there
is
some
chalkiness
at
the
tail
end
as
the
beer
warms
which
is
more
of
a
deterrent
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
even
with
the
bad
sea
monster
pun
slainte
a
super
session
beer
leave
it
to
stone
to
fit
such
a
big
taste
into
such
a
light
body
abv
beer
if
this
was
available
in
md
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
my
only
knock
on
this
is
the
appearance
i
just
dont
like
the
look
of
the
floating
sediment
drinkability
its
odd
because
this
beer
only
has
4
4
abv
it
sort
of
doesnt
surprise
me
because
the
alcohol
presence
isnt
very
strong
but
the
beer
still
has
some
oomph
its
simply
arrogant
bastard
without
as
much
balls
around
4550
ibus
im
guessing
did
they
just
water
down
arrogant
bastard
and
sell
it
as
levitation
drinkability
this
one
is
quaffer
for
sure
a
very
quality
beverage
nice
on
an
autumn
afternoon
d
a
very
drinkable
beergoes
down
nice
and
easily
got
this
one
in
a
mixed
6pack
and
im
wishing
i
had
another
lowest
abv
on
any
stone
nice
to
know
stone
can
make
a
nice
session
beer
almost
like
an
arrogant
bastard
light
if
there
ever
could
be
such
a
thing
the
head
is
a
white
yellowish
color
and
it
has
a
good
stickyness
to
it
the
head
is
still
half
the
way
up
my
glass
and
the
beer
is
all
most
gone
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
taste
to
it
with
a
rich
malt
flavor
the
color
is
a
lot
dark
amber
then
other
amber
beers
i
have
drank
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
is
a
good
year
around
beer
but
it
is
not
as
complex
as
most
other
stone
brews
but
very
good
and
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
to
me
it
sticks
to
the
cheeks
well
but
is
a
touch
watery
decent
carbonation
though
leads
to
a
crisp
edge
good
drinkability
though
id
recommend
this
to
someone
who
was
just
getting
into
craft
beers
for
me
though
there
are
others
out
there
on
the
same
level
d
its
a
very
good
beer
goes
down
with
ease
and
its
a
good
job
since
i
have
a
2l
growler
ahead
of
me
overall
an
awesome
session
brew
the
4
4
makes
this
pretty
drinkable
but
for
my
taste
its
a
bit
onedimensional
to
have
very
much
stone
deserves
endless
props
for
supercharging
the
craft
beer
industry
these
last
few
years
but
im
afraid
theyve
fallen
victim
to
their
own
devices
it
seems
they
feel
every
beer
they
make
even
the
lighter
ones
need
to
be
hopped
to
all
hell
its
time
for
stone
to
break
their
own
mold
thanks
to
bennetj17
for
the
trade
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
great
flavor
as
drinkable
as
can
be
very
pretty
perfect
amber
color
slightly
thin
bubbly
head
the
aroma
is
not
strong
but
there
is
plenty
of
roasty
hoppy
flavor
at
4
4
it
could
be
a
bit
stronger
the
taste
is
mostly
up
front
though
the
aftertaste
is
nice
too
not
a
strong
beer
but
a
very
good
high
quality
beer
a
coppery
red
ale
that
pours
out
fast
and
has
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
fast
a
pleasant
brew
on
the
whole
that
combines
both
bitter
and
sweet
flavors
itll
never
be
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
a
halfnotch
or
so
above
the
middle
of
the
curve
ill
probably
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
and
makes
for
a
great
year
round
session
beer
drinks
quite
well
i
enjoy
this
as
much
as
some
of
their
hi
powered
ales
i
think
this
a
nice
one
to
enjoy
while
listening
towatching
a
storm
blowing
off
the
rockies
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
an
expansive
carbonation
that
engulfs
the
mouth
and
gives
a
nice
creamy
sensation
easily
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
if
i
had
access
to
it
might
serve
as
a
nice
crossover
beer
for
those
new
to
craft
brew
as
well
thanks
to
callenak
for
the
chance
to
sample
this
one
nice
dark
bronze
color
but
the
head
looks
weak
almost
watery
is
this
a
sign
that
stone
has
finally
gone
wrong
by
producing
a
5abv
beer
the
smell
though
puts
things
to
rights
big
american
hops
but
solid
malt
underneath
very
balanced
taste
hoppy
maybe
this
is
to
most
amberred
ales
what
snpa
is
to
your
standard
pale
ales
personally
i
tend
to
like
beers
that
focus
more
on
the
malt
side
of
the
equation
but
this
is
very
nicely
done
solid
mouthfeel
but
light
enough
to
give
good
drinkability
fine
stone
offering
very
crisp
feel
on
the
palate
and
with
a
relatively
low
abv
and
not
nearly
the
bitterness
of
most
of
stones
beers
this
one
is
definitely
highly
drinkable
but
without
the
sacrifice
of
flavor
ive
been
drinking
stone
for
years
and
cant
believe
ive
never
tried
this
brew
before
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
not
as
complex
as
stones
other
beers
but
still
good
goes
down
nice
on
this
hot
summer
day
its
got
a
medium
body
with
a
creamish
mouthfeel
and
a
very
mild
abv
that
make
this
a
very
easy
drinker
for
just
about
anyone
it
is
a
very
tame
beer
coming
from
stone
but
its
not
yellow
and
fizzy
yet
a
wuss
should
be
able
to
handle
this
one
very
dark
and
rich
color
for
an
amber
theres
not
a
ton
of
head
on
this
but
it
makes
a
nice
crown
that
keeps
its
presence
throughout
the
duration
of
the
glass
theres
a
much
bigger
presence
of
hops
in
the
aroma
then
i
expect
from
an
amber
aaah
so
this
is
stone
its
wellhopped
to
give
it
a
serious
character
but
malty
enough
that
even
those
who
fear
the
ipas
should
find
this
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
it
is
rich
and
flavorful
and
the
beer
itself
seems
to
consciously
be
making
the
choice
to
linger
on
my
tongue
before
moving
on
i
had
high
expectations
for
stone
and
im
not
disappointed
if
this
were
available
to
me
locally
it
would
probably
be
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
overall
a
different
beer
not
my
favorite
stone
beer
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
stone
fan
crimson
amber
body
frothy
head
leaves
lace
etched
to
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
floral
hops
citrus
and
sweet
malt
take
the
nose
i
find
the
flavor
profile
to
be
somewhat
deadened
on
the
tongue
initially
it
seems
as
if
the
flavors
meld
together
in
the
back
end
bready
biscuity
malts
are
the
most
prominent
flavor
with
a
dusting
of
hops
to
balance
the
lemon
tartness
mouthfeel
is
right
on
for
the
style
mildly
carbonated
and
very
clean
obviously
a
very
sessionable
brew
especially
given
its
relatively
low
abv
i
could
see
this
being
a
delight
on
cask
as
the
flavors
seem
to
become
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
taste
was
smooth
sweet
at
first
then
a
good
bite
at
the
end
leaving
a
crisp
palate
feeling
little
aftertaste
a
bit
filling
definitely
more
of
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
nevertheless
its
very
good
the
flavor
was
very
mild
pretty
balanced
hopsmalt
not
a
bad
session
beer
if
it
was
easier
to
find
in
ohio
but
very
replaceable
so
its
not
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
this
is
not
as
refreshing
or
as
flavorful
as
other
american
reds
out
there
but
nevertheless
a
sixer
would
make
for
a
nice
session
d
with
that

abv
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
for
hopheads
though
for
for
amberred
ale
fans
this
might
not
be
up
your
alley
some

flavor
might
be
nice
who
knows
it
seems
to
be
ultimately
overlooked
in

rich

hue
thin

with
decent
retention
nice
carbonation
slight

medium
hop
aroma
with
a
slight
nuttiness
notes
of
caramel
and
grape
flavor
from
the
malt
also
not
particularly
inviting
taste
begins
with
a
mild
sourness
and
bitterness
with
a
caramel
nut
flavor
coming
through
semisweet
only
light
to
medium
body
with
solid
carbonation
the
drinkablility
of
this
is
average
or
so
i
really
am
trying
to
grasp
the
amberbrown
malt
flavors
but
its
not
that
intriguing
a
decent
mild
ale
overall
bought
this
one
at
the
brewery
and
it
is
fresh
it
has
great
clarity
a
tight
tan
head
and
a
rich
copperamber
hue
the
aroma
is
well
balanced
nutty
buttery
with
mellow
hops
definitely
not
the
same
hops
as
the
stone
ipa
or
arrogant
bastard
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
from
the
diacetyl
and
has
a
little
co2
bite
that
detracts
from
the
flavor
this
beer
does
have
great
lacing
though
the
flavor
is
balanced
like
the
aroma
and
it
finishes
slightly
nutty
in
the
front
and
dry
in
the
back
the
aftertaste
is
where
i
can
really
enjoy
the
hops
without
the
diacetyl
this
is
a
good
beer
with
an
aftertaste
that
will
keep
you
thirsty
for
more
it
is
a
little
filling
though
with
the
diacetyl
and
slight
overcarbonation
id
get
it
again
a
gargoyle
beer
only
seen
in
my
city
in
magazines
and
the
net
a
retailer
from
tijuana
offer
this
beer
and
i
buy
a
six
from
stone
brewing
ipa
pa
and
levitation
and
i
was
surprised
that
inthe
uncle
sam
land
the
country
is
not
only
good
for
make
the
war
too
is
good
for
brew
beers
of
excelence
like
this
and
others
this
say
with
respect
of
course
i
try
this
with
mexican
food
and
is
a
good
option
for
me
little
different
but
is
good
i
recent
discover
the
craft
beer
world
and
this
is
the
top
of
the
iceberg

recommended
in
conclusion
while
stones
other
beers
are
highlyheld
for
their
wild
in
your
face
flavors
as
they
deserve
to
be
this
beer
deserves
attention
in
its
own
right
a
fantastic
highly
drinkable
session
beer
that
is
also
nicely
complex
being
available
in
six
packs
is
a
godsend
ill
be
buying
this
again
drinkability
an
aggressive
amber
with
an
interesting
flavor
profile
but
the
astringent
finish
knocks
it
down
a
notch
in
my
book
pours
a
nice
deep
clear
amber
color
nice
carbonation
small
tan
head
and
some
lacing
afterwards
scents
of
hops
malts
caramel
and
citrus
nice
taste
for
an
amber
ale
very
exact
to
the
style
sweet
and
slight
hop
taste
nice
little
bitter
bite
at
the
end
medium
body
very
drinkable
at
the
abv
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
off
to
the
store
to
buy
this
again
drinkability
gets
a
lower
score
because
of
the
aftertaste
it
kind
of
becomes
a
chore
just
to
finish
one
of
these
much
less
to
reach
for
another
decent
nofrills
amber
from
stone
maybe
a
tad
bit
much
on
the
bitter
side
for
my
taste
in
ambers
but
really
what
i
would
expect
from
stone
last
swigs
candy
root
beer
barrel
smooth
beer
from
stone
a
little
less
bawlsy
than
most

abv
gotta
read
that
crazy
rant
from
greg
on
the
back
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
the
style
very
well
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
with
the
low
alcohol
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
its
great
to
try
a
mellower
but
still
wellcrafted
stone
beer
tasted
hoppy
up
front
and
in
the
finish
but
in
the
middle
its
a
complex
circus
of
taste
some
toastedburnt
but
not
bold
just
a
smidge
wet
but
in
a
good
sense
not
watery
i
cant
believe
ive
waited
this
long
as
this
may
be
the
best
lower
alcohol
beer
ive
had
and
it
can
be
sessioned
for
sure
puckers
ya
up
in
the
midst
of
pleasure
i
will
bow
at
the
doorsteps
of
stone
in
honor
of
this
product
a
near
perfect
example
of
tasty
complex
low
abv
session
mcgillicutty
great
amber
you
bet
your
bippy
some
might
disagree
but
the
levitation
ale
stuck
me
as
a
good
session
beer
though
slightly
on
the
potent
side
it
pours
a
deep
amber
with
an
eggshell
head
that
sticks
around
the
nose
is
mostly
malt
but
it
finishes
with
a
deep
bettering
hop
character
the
hopping
of
this
beer
is
rather
interesting
as
a
departure
from
some
of
stones
other
brews
the
malts
provide
most
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
but
the
hops
which
hang
low
aromatically
balance
the
abundant
malts
well
it
is
not
the
most
interesting
beer
in
the
world
or
that
stone
brews
but
it
has
the
sort
of
sturdy
simplicity
that
is
too
often
overlooked
in
american
brewing

that
stayed
around
light

all
around
with
some

and
light
hoppy
notes
not
too
much
else
was
there
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
light
bitterness
and
some
earthy

mild
notes
of
pine
and
nuttiness
appeared
at
times
light
bittersweet
finish
pretty
smooth
and
a
bit
lighter
than

which
works
for
this
i
could
make
a
session
of
this
solid
all
around
oh
man
i
just
moved
to
colorado
and
they
have
lotsa
wicked
beers
out
here
picked
up
this
bottle
down
the
street
from
total
beverage
and
consumed
it
the
next
evening
in
july
2005
pours
a
fluffyclingy
finger
and
a
half
light
tan
head
over
a
crystal
clear
dark
rust
brownish
liquid
smells
are
almost
imperceptable
some
piney
citrus
hops
and
weak
caramel
but
only
with
searching
tastes
weakly
piney
with
some
grapefruit
pith
hardly
hop
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
smooth
with
faint
chocolate
and
nut
mdlight
body
and
mildly
carboanted
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
sharp
so
i
will
swirl
to
release
it
loosing
the
acrid
sting
usually
lets
me
pull
other
flavors
out
of
a
beer
for
fans
of
brown
ale
such
as
myself
and
mild
beers
such
as
myself
this
is
a
really
interesting
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
brown
ale
style
very
nice
drinkability
this
one
kinda
tastes
more
like
an
esb
to
me
especially
with
the
hops
in
this
one
not
a
bad
brew
considering
though
good
job
by
stone
regardless
of
the
style
the
smell
is
mostly
of
malts
and
fairly
rich
the
taste
is
nice
and
solid
with
hops
really
taking
over
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
as
rich
as
it
could
be
but
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
havent
had
all
of
stones
creations
yet
and
i
havent
fallen
in
love
with
all
of
them
but
this
is
the
first
one
that
i
dont
have
any
interest
in
revisiting
overall
impression
yet
another
quality
offering
from
stone
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
a
good
malt
backbone
and
plenty
of
hops
without
being
overwhelming
much
more
approachable
for
the
uninitiated
than
most
of
stones
other
offerings
not
a
bad
brew
for
review
number
150
levitation
ale
is
the
only
stone
beer
to
come
exclusively
in
12
ounce
bottles
and
is
the
only
regular
offering
to
score
less
than
4
0
on
this
site
dont
be
misled
however
this
is
excellent
beer
doubly
so
if
you
love
hops
beefing
up
the
body
would
do
wonders
but
then
the
stone
gargoyle
would
have
a
more
difficult
time
levitating
on
the
front
of
the
classy
silkscreened
bottle
lean
and
mean
and
hoppy
as
hell
recommended
it
is
clear
that
this
is
a
balanced
beer
and
the
lighter
alcohol
level
and
body
make
this
one
of
stones
most
drinkable
while
not
my
favorite
stone
brew
it
certainly
tastes
damn
good
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
looks
like
it
will
never
go
away
it
leaves
thick
laces
it
smells
like
citrus
and
maybe
flowers
it
smells
hoppy
but
not
too
over
the
top
it
tastes
slightly
malty
it
has
a
spicy
floral
taste
it
is
lightly
carbonated
it
is
smooth
the
taste
lingers
im
my
mouth
this
beer
can
go
all
night
long
it
is
very
low
in
alcohol
content
so
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
them
it
is
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
i
might
drink
it
again
if
i
came
to
your
house
and
it
was
all
you
had
pours
a
clear
amber
to
brown
color
with
a
big
3
cm
tan
fluffy
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
just
a
slight
bit
of
floral
character
the
flaovr
is
citrusy
with
orange
and
a
spicy
malt
flavor
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
along
with
floral
hop
notes
the
maltiness
dominates
the
flavors
with
the
hops
playing
a
back
seat
role
good
but
not
great
the
malt
profile
tastes
very
onedimensional
without
any
surprises
or
unique
complexities

mild

pulls
through
and
get
stronger
and
stronger
it
still
lingers
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
after
you
swallow
this
beer
was
probably
dry
hopped
its
hoppiness
is
sorta
like
an
american
pale
ale
because
it
is
a
little
piney
and
citrusy
another
great
beer
from
stone
only
complaint
is
that
the
bitterness
seems
too
strong
for
an
american
brown
toasted

dusted
with
powdered
sugar
sweetness
up

more

but
it
serves
its

overall
i
was
let
down
a
bit
i
like
how
the
sweet
and
hoppiness
blended
but
it
seemed
a
little
off
its
very
close
to
being
an
excellent
brew
but
not
quite
there
some
people
get
pissy
with
stone
for
all
the
rave
reviews
they
receive
for
their
beers
but
with
each
one
i
try
i
feel
theres
no
reason
to
consider
stone
overrated

this
is
from
stone
remember
despite
the
4

this
is
not
a
truncated
arrogant
bastard
in
that
it
has
almost
none
of
the
chocolate
and
coffee
spikes
that
punctuate
that
ambrosial
brew
pine
resin
oak
and
citrus
hops
greet
you
initially
followed
by
a
solid
middle
that
i
found
a
little
lacking
in
the
malt
promised
by
the
aroma
it
is
not
sweet
but
rather
bitter
the
carbonation
is
just
right
and
the
finish
is
nicely
dry
and
speaks
of
roasted
grain
all
in
all

as
ive
sampled
from

good

worth
a
try
this
reddishbrown
brew
poured
a
nice
head
and
is
leaving
a
nice
lacing
in
my
pint
smell
is
a
heavy
dose
of
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
taste
is
very
good
with
a
nice
play
between
the
smooth
malts
with
a
mild
hop
finish
when
i
saw
the
4
4
abv
i
did
not
think
this
would
have
the
traditional
stone
quality
but
the
qualiy
is
there
i
am
quite
impressed
with
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
at
4
4
this
makes
a
nice
session
beer
a
tasty
brew
the
mild
alcohol
and
hop
levels
almost
make
it
hard
to
believe
stone
brewed
it
the
finish
is
clean
and
leaves
an
excellent
sweetness
on
the
palate
this
is
the
only
stone
beer
that
i
have
tried
that
did
not
impress
me
that
much
it
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
great
head
that
left
lots
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
quite
malty
with
a
hint
of
piney
hops
in
there
the
taste
well
i
can
only
describe
it
as
arrogant
bastard
light
it
does
have
quite
a
bit
of
hop
kick
and
a
good
malt
backbone
but
it
does
not
tase
unique
enough
to
give
it
a
higher
score
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
though
just
not
all
that
exciting
appearance
deep
ruby
brown
colored
body
with
a
nice
two
finger
deep
cream
fluffy
head
leaves
a
web
of
evenly
strung

cant
beat
the
appearance
here
aroma
awesome
piney
hop
character
with
sweet
caramel
and
fruity
ale
like
characteristics
nice
mild
abv
for
a
stone
brew
but
the
aromatics
come
together
for
this
one
taste
wonderful
american
style
pale
ale
with
stone
signature
bitterness
but
more
of
a
session
arrogant
bastard
ale
very
creamy
tone
applied
to
the
bouquet
of
hoppiness
that
this
beer
has
malts
are
nice
toasted
to
perfection
with
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
good
combonation
for
this
beer
stone
doesnt
disappoint
and
this
milder
beer
that
they
produce
is
no
exception
still
extremely
flavorful
wish
it
was
more
available
to
me
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
packs
a
slippery
oily
hop
resin
tone
that
glides
right
down
the
palate
drinkability
wow
nice
beer
not
the
most
balanced
of
pale
ales
but
for
stone
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
can
get
down
with
because
its
not
shy
on
flavor
or
aromatics
good
stuff
i
owe
one
to
beergeek279
and
cupbeerman
for
this
sample
ah
yes
this
is
much
much
better
the
malt
has
been
kicked
up
a
bit
now
creating
a
slightly
sweet
middle
to
the
beer
which
lingers
with
just
a
hint
of
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
a
swirling
eddy
of
hops
dances
around
the
mouth
from
start
to
finish
with
a
teasing
tingle
leading
into
a
slightly
sharp
lemonlike
flavor
at
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
the
malt
flavors
gather
strength
and
a
toastier
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
despite
the
abundant
carbonation
i
can
see
now
what
they
were
going
for
on
the
first
run
and
theyve
nailed
it
good
good
stuff
this
one
is
definitely
drinkable
easy
to
drink
and
not
overbearing
on
the
alcohol
content
this
is
the
light
beer
for
the
hophead
12
oz
bottle
this
pours
an
amber
color
that
is
almost
clear
with
only
a
little
head
hint
of
grapefruit
in
the
aroma
definitely
some
hoppiness
to
this
beer
slight
taste
of
grapefruit
in
the
beer
not
too
heavily
malted
stone
light
maybe
in
comparison
to
some
of
their
others
but
definitely
a
very
good
beer
the
king
recommends
drinking
this
beer
with
smoked
tritip
is
it
just
me
or
is
it
hysterical
to
write
that
about
a
stone
brew
a
strong
malty
aroma
wafts
from
the
glass
as
i
pour
caramel
malt
perhaps
pours
with
a
thick
tan
head
it
is
pretty
clear
and
a
dark
amber
color
the
aroma
of
hops
is
dominant
in
the
aroma
but
a
solid
malt
presence
is
there
as
well
definitely
a
bitter
beer
some
sweetness
is
here
but
not
really
perceptible
as
the
hops
dominate
the
residual
sweetness
a
certain
fullness
in
the
mouth
from
this
light
beer
from
stone
not
enough
hop
flavor
is
in
this
beer
for
me
it
would
help
to
balance
this
beer
out
this
beer
is
super
hoppy
but
it
needs
more
flavor
hop
contributions
or
perhaps
different
ones
pretty
well
balanced
for
a
super
hoppy
low
gravity
ale
the
malt
notes
really
help
to
carry
this
beer
as
it
warms
up
i
realize
that
this
beer
may
be
a
bit
old
it
tastes
like
it
might
have
begun
to
oxidize
stone
where
is
the
bottle
date
thickstickypuffy
head
with
glue
like
lacing
the
appearance
is
almost
like
a
shiny
copper
candy
bar
wrapper
great
balance
of
sweet
candy
and
citrus
aroma
great
flavor
which
finishes
with
a
nice
and
easy
hop
kick
suprisingly
easy
drinkability
which
helps
the
beer
live
up
to
its
name
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
from
stone
would
be
my
house
beer
if
it
was
more
readily
available
to
me
thanks
goes
out
to
xlperro
for
the
bottle
drinkability

this
is
a
good
drinker
and
a
great
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
ale
with
a
low
abv
good
beer
notes
beautifully
made
six
thumbs
up
medium
brown
color
large
head
aroma
is
malty
a
medium
bodied
amber
malts
are
lively
slightly
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
hops
are
fairly
bitter
very
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
nicely
balanced
it
not
your
typical
stone
brew
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
very
drinkable
very
cool
etched
beer
bottle
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
bitter
thanks
to
winomark
for
bringing
me
arrogant
bastard
ales
milder
little
brother
who
beat
up
the
arrogant
bastard
a
less
powerful
more
sessionable
offering
from
stone
yet
still
complex
i
like
it
and
id
like
to
see
more
brews
like
this
from
them
while
the
low
abv
makes
this
beer
an
attractive
choice
for
session
drinking
the
lean
towards
bitterness
makes
this
style
hard
for
me
to
go
to
regularly
not
bad
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
soon
big
thanks
to
xlperro
for
this
extra
thanks
to
aaronh
for
the
sample
of
this
one
its
a
shame
that
this
beer
couldnt
normally
survive
the
trip
to
the
east
coast
since
this
the
best
low
abv
beer
ive
had
i
wondered
if
i
would
ever
give
a
5
for
drinkability
but
this
certainly
earned
it
stone
has
crafted
another
great
individual
unique
ale
it
feels
great
and
drinks
smooth
with
all
the
hops
very
well
thought
out
deep
amber
color
topped
by
a
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
rocky
ring
of
foam
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
to
see
a
paler
colored
beer
what
a
nice
surprise
a
nice
malty
fruity
aroma
laced
with
some
hops
greets
the
nose
very
inviting
the
taste
is
surprisingly
bitter
considering
the
hops
played
a
supporting
role
in
the
aroma
some
roasted
malt
and
caramel
notes
come
thorugh
after
a
few
sips
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
playing
on
the
tongue
in
between
slaps
of
hoppy
bitterness
a
touch
of
pine
some
saopiness
and
a
dab
of
citrus
all
dance
around
overpowering
the
malt
slightly
unbalanced
but
still
enjoyable
as
the
beer
warms
or
as
my
tastebuds
get
seduced
by
the
hops
the
malt
comes
through
better
and
the
beer
shows
better
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
but
smooth
the
carbonation
is
perfectly
done
not
noticeably
harsh
yet
not
flat
either
and
the
drinkability
is
superb
this
has
a
lot
of
stones
signature
attributes
yet
can
be
consumed
on
a
regular
basis
for
the
duration
of
the
evening
and
most
beer
drinkers
would
still
not
be
worthy
of
this
beer
a
great
session

off
whitetan

on
an

the
burnt
flavor
is
surprising
considering
how

22
february
2003
celebrating
washingtons
birthday
with
a
sampling
of
the
newlyforumulated
levitation
this
is
a
winner
it
has
a
nice
longlasting
tan
head
clear
reddishbrown
color
a
great
balance
of
malt
hops
in
the
flavor
this
is
stones
esb
imho
the
reformulation
is
a
major
improvement
over
the
original
levitation
my
review
of
this
version
is
that
it
is
much
better
in
all
categories
and
more
like
the
stone
brews
i
come
to
know
and
love
bottom
line
call
me
a
wimp
i
still
prefer
london
pride
as
a
lowerabv
alternative
personally
i
like
this
beer
its
a
great
alternative
to
other
lower
alcohol
session
beers
as
it
actually
has
some
hop
presence
even
if
that
presence
is
a
little
overboard
but
hey
this
is
stone
if
i
can
match
the
standards
of
stone
i
would
be
a
very
happy
man
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
holds
pretty
well
lace
throughout
big
aroma
of
hops
right
off
the
bat
as
expected
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
bitter
big
hop
finish
this
is
their
less
alcohol
ale
but
the
no
skimping
on
the
hops
nice
ale
this
definitely
could
be
a
session
beer
if
the
hops
dont
get
to
you
first
it
looks
much
like
many
apas
on
the
market
brownishred
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dimishes
but
sticks
on
top
to
the
end
the
smell
is
pretty
much
all
hops
with
just
a
trace
of
malt
sweetness
and
slight
notes
of
citrus
the
taste
is
almost
all
hop
bitterness
i
kept
searching
for
more
as
i
emptied
the
glass
but
was
left
disappointed
it
tastes
like
someone
was
making
a
pale
ale
and
accidentally
dropped
in
a
triple
dose
of
hops
any
underlying
flavors
disappear
almost
on
hitting
the
mouth
even
at
4
4
id
have
a
hard
time
putting
away
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
charged
with
anticipation
i
eagerly
went
out
and
grabbed
this
on
the
first
day
that
it
was
truly
available
here
in
arizona
after
i
pour
i
observe
a
mouthwatering
amber
colored
brew
with
a
creamcolored
head
that
thins
but
stays
at
just
the
right
level
leaving
scattered
lace
i
soak
in
the
aroma
which
is
huge
as
can
always
be
expected
from
a
stone
brew
juicy
citrus
and
christmas
tree
hops
and
caramel
maltiness
combine
for
a
wonderful
and
unique
aroma
i
take
the
highly
anticipated
first
sip
and
discover
a
suberbly
balanced
malt
and
hop
profile
consisting
of
citrus
and
rindlike
bitterness
which
make
the
aforementioned
christmas
treelike
character
along
with
caramel
and
grainy
malt
character
bitterness
leaves
a
unique
impression
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
hops
also
provide
a
nice
and
sharp
bite
a
crisp
and
satisfying
flavorful
brew
i
just
hate
this
beer
cant
stand
the
taste
at
all
o
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
but
not
bad
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
sniffer
probably
my
favorite
red
ale
to
date
not
a
high
abv
but
loads
of
malty
flavor
makes
up
for
it
notes
of
carmel
malty
sugar
toffee
and
fruitless
are
tasted
there
is
crisp
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
balances
this
beer
out
excellently
had
this
beer
after
about
two
years
of
aging
as
well
as
new
both
tasted
great
with
the
aged
one
being
more
malty
as
expected
seriously
loved
this
beer
and
is
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
a
very
pleasant
surprise
from
a
previously
unknown
brewery
in
a
beer
style
that
i
typically
dont
prefer
all
the
more
surprising
given
all
of
that
condor
recommended
and
approved
you
gotta
check
this
beer
out
one
of
the
finer
amber
ales
ive
had
in
recent
memory
overall
brewdog
have
managed
to
get
themselves
a
reputation
for
being
edgy
or
as
some
would
have
it
full
of
shit
i
have
no
firm
feelings
either
way
but
despite
this
their
beers
tend
to
be
well
regarded
5am
saint
manages
to
be
neither
bad
nor
good
merely
average
it
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
at
least
out
of
the
bottle
maybe
its
better
on
tap
hopefully
ill
find
out
when
i
visit
the
brewdog
pub
in
leeds
early
next
year
drinking
this
on
11114
but
has
a
best
buy
date
on
bottle
of
8414
tastes
slightly
stale
but
otherwise
drinkable
and
ok
sorry
my
local
bottle
shops
stink
with
freshness
issues
on
shelves
nose
of
caramelized
malts
and
hops
all
return
in
mouth
followed
by
a
brief
floral
and
hopped
final
overall
a
very
good
red
ale
that
is
very
easy
going
down
and
has
a
decent
finish
like
all
of
brewdogs
i
have
had
this
one
has
very
heavy
pine
hops
the
hops
are
nice
but
to
be
honest
it
tends
to
make
all
their
beers
taste
very
similar
nice
freshness
and
tartness
real
zip
nice
smell
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
heft
and
for
it
to
have
been
a
little
boozier
aroma
is
the
best
thing
here
floral
a
bit
exotic
appearance
is
average
flavor
on
the
malty
side
body
chewy
overall
decent
n
drinkable
poured
a
hazed
deep
ruddy
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
a
small
amount
of
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mild
blend
of
grain
fruit
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
more
robust
but
follows
in
suit
the
body
has
a
pleasant
thickness
to
it
and
and
a
good
smooth
finish
a
tasty
red
ale
very
nice
beer
the
right
amount
of
hoppy
and
caramel
core
offering
love
the
red
hoppy
style
i
had
this
beer
at
a
hotel
bar
in
sweden
on
61914
the
best
by
date
was
61914
perfect
timing
right
wrong
dense
opaque
amber
appeareneceand
a
mediumdark
head
head
didnt
last
long
taste
was
good
for
an
amber
but
not
remarkable
an
enjoyable
beer
that
was
unfortunately
past
its
prime
id
recommend
trying
5
a
m
saint
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
or
on
tap
i
poured
this
strange
looking
beer
that
i
could
not
figure
out
who
brewed
anchor
or
brewdog
i
guess
nobody
wants
to
claim
it
the
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
beer
with
a
tan
head
that
lasted
all
of
a
minute
the
beer
is
a
hop
bomb
so
i
did
not
like
it
it
also
tasted
like
grass
to
me
i
will
not
buy
again
but
if
you
like
grassy
beer
go
for
it
my
second
experience
with
what
has
certainly
come
to
be
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
this
is
a
red
ale
turned
up
to
11
it
manages
to
be
quite
hoppy
while
at
the
same
time
keeping
a
strong
malt
flavor
as
well
it
pairs
excellently
with
the
assortment
of
meats
and
cheeses
available
as
part
of
the
tasty
pseudoploughmans
lunch
platter
available
at
their
edinburgh
location
as
well
as
with
their
punk
ipa
i
had
both
on
tap
that
day
for
the
first
time
and
definitely
not
the
last
as
rumor
has
it
that
they
are
opening
several
locations
on
this
side
of
the
pond
next
year
altogether
an
excellent
beer
which
i
will
be
regularly
buying
in
bottled
form
until
such
time
as
i
can
find
it
on
tap
again
either
in
scotland
or
the
states
tasty
another
satisfying
brew
from
the
punk
brewers
looks
good
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
a
showcase
for
american
hops
and
the
malt
stays
firmly
in
the
back
seat
body
is
ok
but
could
be
a
shade
thicker
goes
down
a
treat
would
make
a
great
fridge
beer
to
keep
around
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
o
great
drinkability
lovely
american
pale
ale
style
made
in
scotland
hooray
for
brewdog
o
for
me
the
best
american
amberred
ales
deliver
an
initial
separation
of
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malts
before
presenting
something
of
an
integration
of
flavors
on
the
finish
with
this
beer
however
once
the
flavors
separate
and
they
do
so
immediately
they
never
come
together
this
gives
the
beer
a
crude
rough
feel
and
makes
it
seem
a
bit
sloppy
unrefined
and
simplistic
couple
this
lack
of
depth
subtlety
and
complexity
with
a
thinner
than
average
mouthfeel
and
one
is
left
with
a
beer
that
is
less
an
american
amberred
ale
and
more
of
a
thin
lowstrength
ipa
all
the
aromas
and
flavors
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
beer
of
this
style
are
here
in
one
form
or
another
but
the
package
as
a
whole
never
really
comes
together
m
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
finishes
medium
sweet
where
classic
irish
red
ales
might
approach
this
measure
of
savory
caramelization
and
toast
and
where
american
ambers
might
attempt
such
hoppiness
never
have
both
been
captured
in
the
same
glass
until
now
great
job
brewdog
great
job

great

a

to
drink

from

was

of

perhaps
but
does
coat
the

a

oily
with
a
moderate
soft
carbonation
the
fruity
flavor
notes
develop
nicely
as
the
beer
warms
up
finishes
fairly
crisp
but
does
leave
a
malty
echo
and
some
earthy
hops
one
of
the
better

ales
ive
tried
in
recent
memory
clean
crystal
malt
flavors
and
not
cloyingly
sweet
with
a
decent
hop
spice
i
will
be
back
overall
a
nicely
balanced
american
amber
ale
for
my
first
crack
at
brewdog
this
is
a
pleasant
introduction
to
their
offerings
o
drinkable
balanced
different
i
really
like
it
the
price
may
have
been
a
bit
steep
for
an
8
oz
pour
but
ive
come
to
expect
that
from
brewdog
overall
a
refreshing
and
pleasant
experience
from
those
brewdog
mad
scientists
extraordinarily
balanced
and
never
bitter
very
simple
yet
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable

fairly
low

a
little

very
easy
to

well

i
havent
had
much
from

maybe
that
needs
to
change
medium
body
with
dry
earthy
hop
bitterness
up

that
lingers
over
the
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
dry
finish
aggressively
hopped
with
spicy
pine

soily

and
sticky

followed
by
a

strong

slightly
toasty
with
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
toffee

and

complex
and
well
balanced
with
lots

its
kind
of
heavy
so
i
dont

i
could
drink
many
of
them
in
one
sitting
but
they
managed
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
5
session
beer
ill
most
likely
be
picking
up
more
single
bottles
of
this
again
especially
in
the
colder
winter
months
o
i
have
to
say
that
ive
yet
to
try
a
scottish
beer
that
has
let
me
down
and
this
one
is
not
the
exception
this
is
one
of
those
reds
that
tends
towards
a
pale
ale
but
isnt
quite
as
bitter
which
is
what
i
like
about
it
very
drinkable
and
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
would
have
this
one
again
o
hard
to
pin
down
this
is
kind
of
all
over
the
place
not
bad
especially
in
china
but
not
my
first
choice
in
other
settings
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
very
tasty
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
i
had
a
full
24
bottle
case
ordered
on
private
import
and
even
though
i
enjoy
it
very
much
i
dont
think
id
order
another
case
dont
think
id
have
this
beer
in
a
bar
either
unless
its
the
most
interesting
product
after
34
bottles
spread
over
a
few
days
youve
pretty
much
been
around
this
beer
through
and
through
not
the
best
brewdog
product
ive
had
though
still
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
trying
another
great
creation

a
murky
dark

with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a

on

of
the

foamy
swaths

down
smell
is
of
toasted

caramel
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hops
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
earthy
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
much
better
smell
over
taste
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
how
we
like
it
unusual
tastebut
this
is
way
brewdog
is
one
of
the
best
this
seems
like
an
imbalanced
amber
ale
on
the
strange
side
usually
an
amber
ale
has
a
distinct
finish
but
this
beer
is
unlike
others
in
the
style
too
bitter
and
lacking
other
taste
and
aroma
elements
usually
in
an
american
amber
ale
overall
a
somewhat
disappointing
offering
from
brewdog
most
of
their
beers
are
at
least
quite
interesting
this
one
doesnt
stand
up
if
the
taste
followed
the
nose
verbatim
it
would
have
turned
out
better
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
interesting
enough
to
justify
the
asking
price
beer
is
hazy
dark
orangebrown
with
a
moderate
head
that
soon
reduces
to
a
durable
ring
very
hoppy
aroma
for
style
more
like
an
ipa
or
apa
really
the
hops
remain
in
the
flavor
but
in
a
very
subdued
and
mild
form
it
seems
like
im
drinking
a
different
beer
than
the
one
i
am
smelling
nice
beer
is
just
a
bit
shy
of
medium
bodied
and
has
appropriate
medium
carbonation
lending
a
crisp
feel
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
and
with
a
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
o
very
interesting
and
different
than
most
amber
ales
that
i
have
experienced
this
one
does
a
good
job
of
delivering
heavy
hitting
and
unique
flavor
while
maintaining
lightness
and
drinkability
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color

color
slight
retention
and
slight

smells
of
alcohol
citrus
hops
sweet

hop
and
slight
grass
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
ale
mouth
feel
is
very
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
dryness
tastes
of
hops
slight
grass
slight
wet
hop
and
sweet
malt
overall
decent
aroma
and
blend
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
look
the
head
was
glorious
and
even
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
still
remains
this
added
nicely
to
a
mouthfeel
that
was
otherwise
on
the
watery
and
weak
side
while
brewdog
certainly
hit
what
they
were
going
for
here
with
a
nononsense
red
ale
the
flavors
were
a
bit
muted
and
seemingly
underdeveloped
making
us
want
to
reach
for
something
else
next
theres
been
a
lot
of
brewdog
hitting
my
market
recently
guess
the
distributor
is
pushing
them
this
isnt
nearly
as
fresh
as
the
subone
month
old
hardcore
i
had
the
other
day
but
less
than
3
months
isnt
that
bad
it
pours
out
a
hazy
deep
red
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
its
got
earthy
hops
over
a
solid
caramel
malt
on
the
tongue
this
unfolds
as
an
aggressive
ale
it
comes
on
strong
with
citrus
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malts
that
have
just
a
touch
of
a
roasty
flavor
more
pine
and
earthy
hop
flavors
make
themselves
known
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
thirstquenching
overall
this
is
a
great
ale
its
not
a
mindblower
but
ill
pick
this
up
next
time
i
see
it
fresh
for
sure
just
a
solid
aggressive
beer
overall
this
type
of
red
ale
really
works
for
me
a
good
combo
of
citrusy
and
earthy
hops
and
a
malt
character
leaning
more
towards
caramel
than
towards
biscuit
id
definitely
have
this

the

from

such
this
is

a

its

close

the

its
a

good
beer
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
that
this
may
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
brewdog
nonic
of
course
here
dark
amber
with
an
eggshell
head
that
holds
forever
and
leaves
really
pretty
lace
woah

it
seems
like
recently
the
true
american

style
of
beer
has
been
revived
a
bit
and
these

are

with
really
high
quality
ingredients
great
nose
well

and
wellbalanced
hopmalt
character
that
follows
through
to
the
taste
i
mean
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
hop
forward
like
a
hoppy
pale
ale
or
ipa
but
the
malt
should
be
crystal
and
definitely
stand
out
more
than
the
typical
apa
or
ipa
if
im
not
mistaken
so
it
seems
like
its
pretty
much
balanced
like
its
style

which
is

soft

this

you

pair
well
with

food
and
have
a

enough
abv
to
still
drink
a
few
after
youve
had
one
ill
admit
it
i
have
no
idea
what
this
brews
name
means
irregardless
remember
that
word
is
spoken
with
a
semibostonian
accent
it
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
light
tan
foam
the
smell
is
of
pine
citrus
peach
and
caramel
apple
complete
with
plenty
o
nuts
the
pine
and
citrus
mainly
the
peel
in
this
case
run
strong
in
the
taste
with
greenery
flowers
and
a
very
light
bit
o
toffee
for
me
a
bit
unbalanced
in
favor
of
the
hoppier
bits
the
body
is
a
light
medium
making
it
a
bit
heavier
than
it
oughta
be
the
moderately
active
carbonation
and
dry
finish
combined
with
an
aftertaste
of
orange
peel
round
out
a
feel
that
does
not
bring
much
of
a
smile
to
my
lips
still
the
finished
product
is
not
all
that
objectionable
just
not
entirely
desirable
translation
good
for
a
drink
but
not
something
to
be
sought
out
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
like
a
hopped
up
amber
as
much
as
a
good

and
brewdog
did
well
for
themselves

isnt

still
manages
to
go
down
nicely
for

i
could
easily
go
for

of
these
a
solid
example
that
was
very
good
a
tasty
amber
ale
with
lots
going
on
enough
here
to
make
me
drink
more
than
one
drinkability
quite
good
with
a
meal
welsh
rabbit
in
this
case
and
i
could
have
one
alone
but
its
one
alone
the
bitterness
and
hoppiness
of
this
brew
is
more
than
i
want
in
an
amber
ale
a
bit
more
malt
balance
and
i
would
be
very
happy
with
this
one
still
good
overall
overall
im
recalling
something
like
troegs
hopback
amber
as
a
comparable
maybe
slightly
more
complex
brew
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
given
that
it
will
generally
be
a
bit
pricier
as
an
import
i
dont
think
it
justifies
the
price
comparable
domestic
ambers
will
do
just
as
good

not
better

a
bottle
isnt
bad
but
if
were
to
buy
a
case
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
would
warrent
that
a
wonderful
little
beer
a
nice
warm
amber
colour
with
a
good
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
a
slightly
grassy
nose
good
carbonation
and
a
more
subtle
hop
profile
than
you
might
normally
expect
from
brewdogs
more
extreme
beers
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
an
evening
wish
id
bought
more
overall
a
good
beer
great
looking
but
nothing
exceptional
in
terms
of
taste
check
it
out
if
you
find
it
for
a
good
price
quite
a
sipper
for
a
5
beer
very
strong
flavors
keep
this
from
going
down
as
smooth
as
your
typical
amber
but
that
is
welcomed
for
sure
a
brew
that
i
will
keep
stocked
when
ever
i
can
the
nice
hop
kick
of
a
nn
but
still
a
nice
amber
good
bitter
hops
with
a
nice
malt
finish
a
great
session
beer
at
only
5
which
makes
this
worth
the
price
there
have
been
a
few
beers
of
late
venturing
into
the
realm
of
amber
ipa
nn
lucky
13
and
stone
13
to
name
a
few
reminds
me
of
the
newfound
black
ipa
beers
that
are
popping
up
all
over
this
one
falls
into
the
same
categorization
as
those
while
still
managing
to
be
unique
tasting
toasty
malts
give
way
to
a
big
grassy
hop
flavor
and
a
long
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
im
glad
the
abv
is
kept
low
keeps
it
drinkable
and
allows
more
of
the
hoppy
goodness
to
shine
through
touch
of
sourness
that
strangely
enough
compliments
the
hops
quite
nicely
after
shelling
out
the
cash
for
this
one
i
found
this
plenty
good
enough
to
go
try
a
couple
more
of
bdawgs
offerings
this
one
is
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
d
a
5
hoppy
amberred
ale
now
thats
my
idea
of
a
session
pretty
drinkable
the
smell
made
promises
that
the
taste
couldnt
keep
d
very
drinkable
hops
really
carry
the
beer
and
is
well
balanced
by
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
in
this
not
over
done
one
way
or
another
really
nice
example
of
the
better
us
amber
ales
that
are
out
there
the
5
makes
this
very
drinkable
and
could
have
23
of
these
easily
first
brewdog
beer
i
have
liked
so
far
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
in
my
opinion
apart
from
that
this
was
great
this
brew
pours
a
nice
deep
mahogany
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
and
sticky
sporadic
lacingthe
aroma
is
beautiful
tropical
fruit
punch
with
hints
of
melonpineapple
and
passionfruit
very

indeedit
has
an

to
it
with
the
aromas
of

and
it

with
a
nice
bitter
kick
but
not
overly
bitter
and
very
moreishto
be
honest
i
could
smell
and
drink
this
all
day
probably
one
of
the
best
brewdog
brews
i
have
sampled
so
far
heres
a
brewdog
beer
worth
looking
for
that
wont
break
the
bank
very
american
in
character
and
a
delight

the

i
expected
with

get

this

a
bright
copper
red
with
a

you
get
tons
of
passionfruit
pineapple

it
tasted
incredibly
smooth
with
some
light
bitterness
a
ton
of
pine
and
citrus
it
was
very
forestry
tasting
in
a
good
way
it
was
a
good
beer
to
start
off
the
tasting
with
freaking
solid
on
cask
one
of
my
all
time
favourite
british
beers
one
of
brewdogs
best
a
frontloaded
pacnwfriendly
dose
of
hops
but
one
which
unfortunately
peters
out
towards
the
end
overall
another
confusing
if
still
quite
tasty
ale
from
this
wannabe
sexy
brewery
the
funny
thing
is
ill
be
up
until
around
5
a
m
tomorrow
morning
by
design
for
a
software
implementation
at
work
would
that
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
during
that
time
for
their
iconoclastic
support
at
the
very
least
it
pours
as
a
quite
dark
amber
colour
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
laced
with
the
unmistakable
scent
of
north
american
hops
pine
lots
of
citrus
and
fruit
grapefruit
apricot
oranges
there
is
lots
of
grapefruit
and
hops
alongside
a
caramel
malty
backbone
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
palete
with
a
clean
and
fresh
feel
a
decent
beer
and
a
good
addition
to
their
range
will
definitely
be
getting
some
more
of
this
considering
that
this
beer
is
one
of
the
staples
of
the
bruerys
lineup
it
might
play
second
fiddle
to
many
of
their
seekers
dont
miss
out
this
one
is
a
true
gem
hoppy
nose
malty
finish
great
local
brew
seems
to
have
changed
a
lot
over
the
past
few
years
hoppy
and
bitter
up
front
caramel
malt
on
the
finish
a
slightly
malt
and
caramel
forward
brew
with
hints
of
almost
raspberries
and
grapefruit
a
decent
bitterness
cuts
the
sweetness
as
the
oak
and
bitterness
combine
to
finish
off
the
brew
overall
complex
yet
balanced
not
over
the
top
i
think
they
did
a
very
good
job
with
this
one
very
approachable
and
also
complex
the
bruery
can
do
no
evil
overall
quite
a
nice
red
amber
ale
and
uniquely
made
and
tasting
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
that
is
explosively
carbonated
not
that
good
would
not
buy
again
i
cant
believe
this
bottle
didnt
explode
prior
to
me
opening
it
im
sure
my
experience
is
atypical
of
what
the
bruery
intended
and
what
others
have
reviewed
but
i
would
never
waste
my
money
knowing
this
might
be
whats
inside
loakal
red
again
o
4
5
its
an
interesting
concept
and
a
great
red
ale
but
i
was
expecting
to
get
more
from
the
oak
barrels
i
guess
with
only
25
being
aged
in
barrels
youd
expect
it
to
be
pretty
mellow
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
impressive
i
think
this
is
in
my
top
two
or
three
from
the
bruery
oa
solid
beer
worth
trying
at
least
once
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
lots
of
sweet
fruity
notes
and
vibrant
hops
the
wood
is
a
bit
subdued
but
still
gives
it
a
certain
something
pricey
but
worth
trying
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
thick
heavy
white
head
glued
to
glass
smell
was
a
bit
underwhelming
for
me
but
some
crisp
hops
smooth
caramel
and
bread
hold
it
together
taste
is
very
good
chewy
caramel
sweetness
up
front
bread
and
malt
in
the
middle
with
the
oak
aging
coming
through
too
and
some
and
some
pepper
spice
and
hoppy
bitterness
bring
up
the
rear
feel
is
thick
but
a
bit

overall
decent

go

it

highly
enjoyable
offering
o
solid
red
ale
that
is
dominated
in
the
flavor
from
the
malt
side
would
have
liked
to
see
the
flavor
have
as
much
of
the
hops
as
the
nose
did
overall
its
a
good
red
not
fantastic
but
super
solid
good
o
a
super
hopped
up
red
ale
definitely
more
ipa
than
red
this
beer
is
awesome
i
cant
imagine
how
the
imperial
version
is
going
to
taste
overall
nice
treat
from
socal
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
would
drink
it
again
m
medium
bodied
round
mouthfeel
from
oak
addition
o
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
great
and
drinks
easy
a
very
good
beer
with
good
flavors
and
solid
balance
the
bruery
does
another
unique
take
on
a
common
style
the
25
oak
aged
beer
that
is
blended
into
the
fresh
beer
really
accentuates
the
natural
pine
characteristics
of
the
centennial
and
summit
hops
that
were
used
in
this
ale
this
is
quite
the
juicy
and
complex
red
ale
the
bruery
did
it
again
highly
recommended
a
surprisingly
decent
offering
from
the
bruery
not
too
much
is
trying
to
be
done
here
and
as
a
result
the
nose
is
aromatic
the
flavor
has
good
balance
and
the
feel
is
spot
on
worth
trying
o
this
strongly
reminds
me
of
bells
this
goes
to
11
ale
but
this
one
might
have
a
better
balance
and
a
touch
less
of
a
massive
hop
profile
though
im
not
always
an
amber
ale
drinker
i
was
in
the
mood
and
this
went
above
and
beyond
my
expectations
i
always
expect
a
lot
from
the
bruery
and
they
certainly
deliver
with
this
one
glad
they
finally
shipped
it
outside
of
oc
a
mighy
fine
red
ale
nice
hop
character
with
an
even
nicer
complex
enjoyable
oaky
malt
body
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
the
imperial
loakal
red
this
has
a
great
balance
to
it
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
ill
definately
buy
this
again
when
i
see
it
overall
quite
nice
the
oak
is
really
interesting
nice
malts
too
hops
are
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
not
too
bad
it
also
seems
like
it
wants
to
be
boozy
but
doesnt
quite
get
there
tricky
the
imperial
version
should
be
interesting
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
bruery
pleasantly
different
from
the
norm
this
is
a
really
flavorful
red
ale
and
at
6
9
is
very
drinkable
o
as
straightforward
as
a
bruery
beer
can
get
this
red
ale
boasts
wonderful
hop
bitterness
built
upon
a
standard
red
ale
malt
base
although
somwhat
lacking
in
malt
complexity
this
brew
is
a
decent
hoppy
take
on
the
american
red
ale
overall
much
more
hop
forward
than
i
expected
very
nice
cartel
and
oak
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
loakal
o
great
potential
good
execution
not
quite
different
enough
to
click
with
me
certainly
drinkable
recommendable
but
unspecial
and
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
d
very
drinkable
the
barrel
aging
really
adds
a
great
dimension
of
complexity
to
the
beer
that
starys
very
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
beige

that
settles

malty
and
fruity
with
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
and
herbal
hops
with
a
subtle
caramel
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
offering
from
the
bruery
its
a
fine
example
of
when
a
brewery
takes
a
nice
red
ale
and
hits
it
with
some
oak
a
wellrounded
beer
my
only
significant
complaint
is
the
high
price
as
with
most
bruery
beers
will
see
how
it
holds
up
with
another
6
months
of
aging
overall
i
think
that
being
inbetween
a
dry
and
a
sweet
sort
of
red
ale
is
kind
of
holding
it
back
the
finish
is
where
i
have
an
issue
it
kind
of
trails
off
into
a
blandness
but
the
initial
hit
is
fantastic
and
flavorful
i
still
like
it
but
i
would
only
really
drink
it
with
a
complimenting
food
doa
more
hops
than
nose
suggests
subtle
creamy
texture
with
some
faint
citrus
that
gives
off
some
sweetness
to
balance
the
malt
presence
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
bready
yeast
but
hops
are
still
prominent
decent
amount
of
dry
bitterness
but
still
well
balanced
with
above
average
drinkability
simultaneously
delicious
and
interesting
the
loakal
red
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
the
bruery
the
great
color
is
an
inviting
sight
and
the
aroma
that
goes
along
with
it
really
prepare
you
for
the
first
flavorful
sip
the
head
was
impressive
and
stuck
around
for
a
while
the
first
smell
was
typical
of
a
red
amber
and
the
second
yielded
a
wood
grain
scent
the
first
sip
was
very
flavorful
and
the
wood
grain
scent
stuck
around
for
the
taste
as
well
giving
a
smoked
grain
aftertaste
definitely
a
smooth
taste
that
lasted
for
the
rest
of
the
glass
o
overall
i
really
enjoy
red
ales
with
this
much
flavor
i
feel
like
ca
does
a
good
job
producing
ales
of
this
type
see
hop
head
red
by
green
flash
very
flavorful
and
well
crafted
delicious

the
aroma
was
sweet
nice
touches
of
caramel
malts
and
an
almost
candy
like
sweetness
that
was
wrapped
up
nicely
in
a
bit
of
a
grassy
earthy
hop
like
nose
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
but
i
have
to
admit
i
am
impressed
here
with
this
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
here
a
bit
of
a
hotness
that
i
have
not
seen
in
the
rest
of
the
their
beers
lots
of
grainy
malts
touches
of
light
caramel
and
a
mostly
understated
hop
flavo
o
great
beer
wish
they
would
throw
this
into
4
or
6
packs
so
i
could
drink
it
regularly
i
guess
its
a
bit
of
a
process
to
make
it
unfortunately
as
id
love
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
not
what
i
expected
but
overall
it
is
an
ok
beer
for
a
tasting
or
a
session
drinkability
was
very
good
taste
was
sweet
and
one
dimensional
overall
this
is
a
really
good
hoppy
red
ale
the
hop
profile
along
with
the
malt
backbone
worked
together
well
i
would
have
this
one
again
mouthfeel
medium
and
medium
on
carbonation
and
body
a
bit
of
sticking
in
the
mouth
the
sweet
amber
malt
in
this
beer
is
great
in
flavor
but
its
overtaken
by
the
oak
bitterness
that
lasts
forever
wiping
the
sweet
taste
from
your
palates
memory
this
also
happened
with
the
bruerys
batch
300
tripel
they
really
need
to
rein
in
the
oak
flavors
the
overcarbonation
wasnt
really
an
issue
but
worth
noting
this
is
so
close
to
being
a
great
brew
that
i
can
taste
it
get
it
that
said
this
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
ales
that
the
bruery
has
produced
this
is
what
i
expect
from
an
amber
ale
delicious
nice
beer
the
oak
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
had
anticipated
given
the
stated
ratio
on
the
bottle
but
thats
fine
by
me
perfect
for
a
new
england
fall
afternoon
overall
a
tasty
red
ale
a
bit
heavy
on
the
vanillaoak
charachter
but
very
complex
dr
drinkable
for
the
relatively
high
abv
low
quality
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
medium
cream
colored
head
that
slowly
disappears
scent
is
very
hoppy
with
some
nice
caramel
malt
aromas
sweet
fruits
and
light
vanilla
with
just
a
bit
of
leather
taste
is
reminds
me
of
fresh
baked
bread
quickly
followed
by
hops
and
a
lot
of
vanilla
nice
subtle
oak
presence
as
well
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
linger
with
each
sip
as
the
hops
and
vanilla
blend
nicely
very
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
with
a
nice
bittersweet
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
highly
recommend
drinking
this
beer
with
a
fresh
palate
to
really
enjoy
it
and
experience
its
complexities
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
after
i
had
a
couple
bigger
beers
and
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
at
all
loakal
red
was
a
very
nice
amber
something
i
wouldnt
have
necessarily
expected
from
the
bruery
it
seems
like
this
would
have
had
to
been
made
more
than
once
as
this
is
still
extremely
hoppy
and
bitter
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
think
this
would
be
a
nice
crisp
and
easy
addition
to
a
year
round
lineup
overall
this
is
a
winner
and
i
though
hottenroth
was
the
best
bruery
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
newcurrent
favorite
styles
imperial
red
and
it
is
taken
a
step
further
and
merged
with
my
favorite
style
woodaged
beers
so
for
me
this
is
pure
heaven
its
a
beer
that
i
could
and
would
drink
365
days
a
year
because
of
its
big
yet
dry
and
crisp
very
drinkable
highly
recommend
if
you
can
find
it
because
its
only
distributed
locally
trade
for
it
or
look
for
it
on
a
few
websites
that
ship
to
several
states
outside
of
california
o
really
good
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
red
beers
nugget
nectar
is
one
of
my
favorites
when
im
at
school
in
ny
and
this
one
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
had
i
do
prefer
my
red
ales
to
be
more
hoppy
while
this
is
certainly
more
hop
heavy
than
others
of
the
style
everything
takes
a
back
seat
to
nn
will
buy
again
if
given
the
opportunity
hoppy
reds
are
right
up
my
alley
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
could
use
just
a
touch
more
hoppiness
but
overall
a
great
beer
wish
theyd
distribute
it
nationally
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
strong
slightly
off
white
head
that
lasts
the
nose
has
a
certin
sweet
and
sourness
to
it
cherry
oak
hops
taste
is
of
tart
cherries
hops
vanilla
oak
all
vary
layered
great
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
it
is
well
carbed
with
a
medium
body
and
a
lingering
taste
on
the
finish
petty
awesome
take
on
the
style
opretty
decent
red
ale
it
has
a
subtle
complexity
to
it
much
like
caviar
unfortunately
thats
not
how
i
like
my
beers
id
still
enjoy
an
entire
750ml
to
myself
though
simply
a
very
good
ale
with
lots
of
flavour
and
an
interesting
interplay
of
malt
hops
and
oak
o
creamy
delicious
oaky
delight
the
wood
plays
masterfully
with
the
hops
hop
freshness
blended
with
the
oak
giving
this
a
drier
hop
experience
it
really
drinks
like
a
gentlemans
ipa
meant
for
consumption
on
polo
grounds
and
private
golf
clubs
though
this
isnt
a
gimmick
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
is
the
real
deal
would
love
to
taste
this
fresh
alongside
a
fresh
nugget
nectar
battle
for
red
deliciousness
o
overall
not
bad
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
from
the
bruery
but
for
the
price
it
is
not
worth
the
price
tag
an
ultimately
disappointing
red
if
only
because
the
aroma
was
so
incredibly
special
ill
certainly
try
this
one
again
hoping
for
something
different
that
smell
alone
is
almost
worth
the
purchase
price
its
nice
to
see
bruery
pushing
its
bondaries
even
if
that
means
making
something
that
every
other
socal
brewery
does
sweetness
is
light
for
a
red
ale
carbonation
is
firm
and
pleasant
oak
notes
are
solid
offers
some
dark
raisin
and
brown
sugar
on
the
close
a
good
and
characterful
beer
that
resides
somewhat
within
a
not
very
preferred
style
well
done
overall
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that
i
really
really
liked
this
red
to
the
point
where
it
might
be
the
best
red
i
have
had
to
date
great
flavor
and
incredible
balance
the
nose
is
wonderful
but
the
taste
is
less
dominating
than
anticipated
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
huge
white
head
the
aroma
is
classic
red
ale
with
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
but
i
also
get
a
lot
of
oak
notes
from
the
barrel
aging
while
the
aroma
is
good
the
flavor
is
better
and
more
complex
i
get
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
notes
as
well
as
some
oak
maple
and
vanilla
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
cherry
and
other
dark
fruit
in
the
aroma
which
is
a
welcome
addition
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
relatively
low
alcohol
barrel
aged
beer
overall
its
pretty
good
for
a
strong
amber
i
like
the
buiscuity
bready
malts
and
the
touch
of
rye
with
just
a
hint
of
oak
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
an
excelletn
example
of
the
style
o
i
cant
believe
that
this
is
an
amber
ale
as
it
has
a
hop
character
that
rivals
some
of
the
best
ipas
out
there
and
really
does
a
fantastic
job
of
playing
up
and
balancing
its
flavors
im
shocked
people
dont
flip
out
more
over
this
beer
as
simply
a
beer
its
fantastic
and
as
an
instyle
comparison
its
out
of
this
world
i
would
try
this
again
and
again
excellent
drinkability
and
pleasure
in
this
one
keep
up
the
good
work
bruery
guys
o
i
enjoyed
this
very
unique
and
complex
flavor
all
over
the
place
but
they
work
well
together
o
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
off
the
tap
i
have
a
feeling
it
would
be
quite
different
i
love
the
outdoor
flavour
component
to
this
and
would
have
it
again
for
sure
do
there
are
a
few
beer
styles
that
are
more
likely
to
cause
a
certain
typecasting
of
their
producer
the
kind
of
association
which
for
better
or
for
worse
will
forever
connect
brewer
to
style
american
ipa
is
one
such
style
and
the
bruery
seems
intent
on
not
having
their
reputation
tied
to
it
the
practical
outcome
is
that
they
find
all
sorts
of
other
lessconventional
vehicles
for
hops
delivery
here
they
pack
a
hoppy
red
ale
with
a
lot
of
assertive
oakit
is
definitely
not
an
ipa
but
it
stands
in
well
enough
if
anything
it
is
one
of
the
most
reserved
and
understated
of
all
their
more
popular
hoppy
beers
less
focused
on
the
hop
profile
than
humulus
lager
and
less
intense
in
general
than
cornballer
or
old
richland
it
drinks
easily
but
lacks
that
compelling
extremeness
of
its
cousins
o
i
will
drink
again
thinking
about
pairing
this
with
some
apple
pie
o
did
i
say
this
is
very
oakywoody
too
high
for
my
tastes
i
think
the
wood
seems
to
be
smothering
the
hops
a
bit
earthy
and
carameltoffee
malty
sweetness
helps
but
doesnt
counteract
the
wood
enough
cut
back
the
wood
or
maybe
it
will
mellow
unfortunately
as
well
as
the
hops
and
smooth
out
a
bit
with
time
but
not
sure
that
will
do
it
any
service
either
somewhat
enjoyable
but
definitely
not
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorites
either
d
a
bit
strong
in
the
oak
tastes
and
is
a
bit
outside
the
amberred
category
however
still
a
well
made
beer
that
i
really
would
love
to
bottle
as
a
fragrance
although
the
missus
might
disagree
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
try
on
draft
just
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
have
one
while
out
here
overall
a
very
nice
red
ale
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
especially
with
some
salami
and
cheese
drink
one
of
those
beers
again
i
forgot
about
how
good
it
was
because
it
has
been
so
long
i
will
have
this
again
for
sure
good
amber
with
strong
flavors
and
well
balanced
the
only
downfall
of
this
beer
is
that
there
is
so
much
going
on
that
one
pint
maybe
two
is
probably
enough
once
you
spend
a
few
minutes
really
focusing
on
what
is
going
in
here
i
am
ready
to
move
on
this
is
a
great
beer
but
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
immense
hop
malt
and
oak
character
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
oak
adds
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
not
typically
found
in
a
red
ale
750ml
bottle
from
provisions
store
pours
dark
copper
with
chunky
2
finger
offwhite
head
aroma
has
wood
orange
and
lemon
pledge
perfumey
taste
has
strong
wood
flavor
but
the
hops
arent
as
prominent
as
i
thought
theyd
be
medium
bodied
with
a
slickcreamy
texture
finish
is
smooth
mouthfeel
on
this
is
fantastic
it
just
coats
the
mouth
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
oaked
beers
but
this
ones
pretty
good
huge
chunky
pour
had
to
wait
forever
to
get
this
in
the
glass
but
once
it
was
in
there
a
beauty
definate
oak
in
the
nose
but
some
stong
hops
as
well
just
to
put
it
out
there
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
oakaged
beers
yet
but
this
may
change
me
it
wasnt
overpowering
with
the
oak
just
a
suttleness
that
adds
a
ton
of
character
to
the
6
9
brew
which
is
welcomed
compared
to
many
of
the
other
over
the
top
oakey
brew
on
the
market
this
won
me
over
on
drinkablility
very
easy
to
put
down
and
enjoy
all
of
the
flavors
and
not
be
worried
about
being
ripped
good
stuff
d
its
a
keeper
looking
forward
to
my
second
glass
d
happy
to
had
tried
this
but
do
not
think
i
would
seek
it
out
in
the
future
maybe
if
enjoyed
fresher
it
would
have
been
better
drinkability
none
of
us
were
crazy
about
this
one
not
my
favorite
bruery
offering
i
wish
this
was
a
beer
that
i
could
find
on
a
regular
basis
sharp
hop
flavors
that
are
just
so
delicious
and
wrapped
around
a
backbone
of
oak
which
is
prominent
sticky
waxy
citrus
resin
some
vanilla
and
spice
toffee
and
caramel
maltiness
which
actually
leaves
a
nice
dry
aftertaste
which
is
long
a
delicious
d
i
really
think
anyone
who
likes
barrelaged
beers
will
enjoy
this
one
a
fresh
take
on
a
classic
style
well
done
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
while
i
was
in
california
very
delicious
i
think
its
better
than
nugget
nectar
overall
this
wasnt
really
for
me
i
dig
the
hops
but
too
much
malt
here
very
dry
i
wont
have
too
much
d
high
very
high
couldve
drank
a
whole
bottle
by
myself
and
reach
for
another
55
a
really
great
rye
beer
get
this
one
this
is
one
i
could
easily
have
more
of
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
easily
if
it
came
that
way
a
lovely
job
of
a
good
ol
hoppy
amber
d
good
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
the
flavors
are
balanced
well
its
quite
intriguing
with
flavors
that
ive
never
really
tasted
before
and
it
makes
me
want
to
continue
exploring
them
d
tasty
beer
id
drink
this
again
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
really
nice
light
tan
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
a
fair
amount
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
plus
a
bit
of
oak
and
some
sweet
amber
malt
the
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
with
a
fairlystrong
oak
presence
plus
some
citrus
and
pine
hops
body
is
medium
with
a
slight
bitterness
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
time
and
the
flavors
and
scents
never
really
seemed
to
pop
or
meld
hopefully
the
bruery
will
stray
out
toward
styles
like
this
more
often
as
this
was
a
step
in
a
positive
direction
poured
from
bottle
into
a
nb
globe
pours
a
slightly
hazy
red
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
settles
into
a
really
creamy
cap
with
good
lacing
smell
is
citrusy
orange
zest
lots
of
bright
fruity
hops
malty
sweetness
some
oak
and
a
slight
homebrew
tinniness
taste
is
good
but
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
the
hops
that
were
in
the
aroma
some
citrus
and
pine
hops
malty
sweetness
a
hint
of
oak
with
a
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
a
bit
sticky
very
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
red
smell
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
bet
it
is
amazing
when
it
is
really
fresh
d
a
very
good
red
ale
normally
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
lots
of
nice
oak
and
fruit
in
the
taste
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
would
like
to
have
again
d
a
very
good
american
red
ale
highly
drinkable
and
very
tasty
this
is
delicious
i
love
ambers
this
is
nice
and
complex
but
very
vivid
i
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
drinkability
i
have
a
feeling
this
may
wear
on
me
the
more
i
drink
the
bottle
and
i
may
have
wished
i
shared
it
with
someone
but
overall
was
impressed
by
this
beer
d
i
think
its
a
little
strong
in
the
oak
tastes
and
doesnt
fit
the
amberred
category
however
still
a
well
made
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
having
again
d
this
was
very
refreshing
and
is
one
of
the
better
bruery
beers
ive
had
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
oak
considering
only
25
of
the
beer
was
aged
that
way
after
a
half
glass
i
felt
i
could
do
with
a
touch
less
still
definitely
recommended
particularly
while
its
fresh
i
had
to
try
this
beer
a
few
times
before
i
really
got
it
although
its
intended
to
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
pretty
complex
and
unique
recommended
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
was
very
tasty
out
of
the
bottle
and
on
tap
real
solid
amber
from
the
bruery
that
was
not
belgian
style
seems
like
they
can
also
get
done
on
american
styles
as
well
an
enjoyable
one
to
drink
overall
if
youre
going
to
classify
this
as
an
amber
ale
its
really
the
class
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
though
this
is
venturing
more
into
the
imperial
amber
category
if
you
classify
it
as
such
beers
like
troegs
nugget
nectar
and
green
flash
hop
head
red
are
certainly
superior
drinkability
its
pretty
tasty
the
restrained
hop
bitterness
allows
the
quarteroak
to
come
forward
a
bit
more
which
i
like
though
hopheads
may
be
left
disdainfully
shrugging
their
shoulders
at
this
one
quite
unmatched
and
fresh
but
not
altogether
mindblowing
theres
something
about
the
barrelaging
and
the
flavors
it
imparts
that
makes
lr
taste
diluted
interesting
nonetheless
d
incredibly
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
on
a
regular
basis
overall
a
unique
hoppy
red
ale
thats
quite
delicious
and
very
drinkable
loakal
red
pours
an
impossibly
deep
maroon
to
the
point
its
beginning
to
cross
the
line
into
brown
cherry
highlights
are
readily
apparent
when
the
beer
is
held
directly
up
to
light
though
the
khaki
colored
crown
is
enormous
to
begin
with
four
plus
fingers
and
retention
is
off
the
charts
the
frothy
cap
never
disappears
completely
but
slowly
drops
and
collapses
into
the
center
almost
as
if
i
had
dropped
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
into
the
glass
that
was
slowly
melting
nose
is
a
very
good
blend
its
equal
parts
citrus
and
caramel
with
just
a
hint
of
oak
coming
through
as
well
caramel
and
grapefruit
show
up
again
in
the
taste
but
are
both
overpowered
by
the
oak
influence
theres
some
straight
oak
flavor
as
well
as
an
almost
sour
tannic
quality
that
is
way
too
potent
im
a
little
let
down
that
loakal
reds
not
a
little
hoppier
seeing
as
it
advertises
itself
as
a
brash
red
ale
on
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
bodied
and
exceptionally
chewy
for
being
so
this
would
have
been
a
problem
if
the
beer
was
as
hoppy
as
i
was
anticipating
but
with
a
more
subtle
hop
flavor
it
works
carbonation
is
just
about
picture
perfect
too
medium
to
high
and
with
enough
verve
to
elevate
what
centennial
characteristics
there
are
yet
it
stops
short
of
being
fizzy
i
really
like
the
idea
of
loakal
red
blending
a
barrel
aged
version
of
a
beer
this
style
with
a
fresh
batch
is
fairly
unique
but
the
tannic
quality
from
the
oak
barrels
not
to
mention
the
oak
flavor
ran
roughshod
over
everything
and
ruined
what
was
an
otherwise
excellently
executed
beer
really
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
a
limited
realease
from
the
bruery
this
is
a
favorite
of
their
lineup
so
far
update
81111
had
again
at
stadium
tavern
no
bandaid
nonsense
so
im
raising
the
score
on
smell
taste
and
overall
0
5
points
d
extremely
easy
drinking
and
the
hop
profile
while
intense
is
very
well
done
aroma
has
a
good
base
of
caramel
and
some
hearty
malt
nice
wood
character
with
a
good
herbal
orangey
hop
note
taste
is
big
as
well
good
amoutn
of
residual
sugar
mediumfull
mouthfeel
with
good
toffeeish
malt
oak
character
caramel
the
bitterness
is
relatively
on
the
lighter
side
but
its
there
some
vanilla
in
the
finish
its
a
very
nice
beer
with
no
real
flaws
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
this
is
my
favorite
red
ale
in
the
world
so
many
good
red
ales
simply
go
for
the
ipa
hopping
sure
this
has
tons
of
centennials
in
it
and
they
are
very
complimentary
but
this
is
no
one
trick
pony
the
25
barrel
aging
really
seems
to
be
the
perfect
amount
beer
is
pretty
light
in
body
and
pretty
fruity
in
a
good
way
in
the
flavors
its
pretty
hoppy
and
overall
good
i
like
this
beer
its
not
wonderful
its
not
an
ipa
but
its
a
solid
american
red
yum
donly
6
9
but
a
very
complex
brew
i
go
to
school
in
orange
county
so
a
trip
to
the
provisions
store
is
a
weekly
occurrence
now
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
awesome
beer
bruery
overall
i
could
go
to
a
bar
and
drink
4
of
these
in
a
row
very
easy
drinking
and
very
good
very
drinkable
shame
it
aint
bottled
d
one
of
the
few
new
beers
from
the
bruery
that
ive
really
been
impressed
with
lately
of
course
its
not
do
it
to
gruit
id
gladly
have
another
glass
of
this
d
a
solid
red
from
the
bruery
im
not
usually
the
biggest
red
fan
but
this
was
nice
i
think
the
oak
aging
helped
to
round
out
the
flavours
making
it
almost
a
light
barleywine
overly
carbonated
with
too
much
of
a
sour
bite
on
first
taste
weak
flavors
throughout
with
a
disappointing
finish
not
great
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
spectacular
overall
this
would
be
a
great
session
for
a
long
ball
game
feel
both
crisp
and
smooth
pours
a
deep
orangeamber
good
head
and
minor
lacing
if
any
aroma
is
very
mild
sweet
like
honey
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
is
a
good
amount
but
it
stops
right
before
being
too
much
nice
taste
is
somewhat
balanced
with
hints
of
honey
malt
hops
and
a
little
citrus
mouthfeel
is
awesome
bubbly
and
goes
down
rapidly
lol
overall
a
well
done
beer
bottle
from
lazy
dog
macon
pours
amber
with
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
fruits
honey
and
hops
taste
of
fruit
and
nectar
not
too
shabby
overall
its
a
mildly
refreshing
beer
some
annoying
flavors
its
easy
to
see
why
this
american
amber
ale
has
garnered
accolades
in
recent
great
american
beer
festival
competitions
excellent
balance
and
drinkability
overall
i
just
did
not
dig
this
brew
that
much
the
caramel
sweetness
was
good
but
what
came
directly
after
that
was
hard
to
pin
down
on
the
palate
o
not
a
bad
amberred
ale
but
also
not
exceptional
either
it
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
west
coast
brewery
tackling
the
style
try
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hoppy
turbulent
amber
ales
and
are
willing
to
overlook
the
fact
that
it
is
a
bit
twodimensional
o
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
overall
nice
sessionable
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
a
very
thin
off
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
caramel
orange
zest
and
grassy
grains
the
taste
actually
has
even
more
going
on
and
is
more
complex
than
the
aroma
has
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
but
didnt
linger
to
long
unlike
some

a
good

that
turned
into
a
nice

this
beer
was
very
well
balanced
it
was
malty
with
some
smooth
caramel
flavors
but
it
was
not
sweet
it
had
a
good
piney
hop
presence
for
a
red
ale
which
i
really
appreciated
this
was
a
nice
beer
balance
is
definitely
toward
the
malt
side
though
the
hops
prevent
the

from
becoming
cloying

a

it
off
i
generally
like
amberred
ales
that
are
a
bit
hoppier
but
this
one
is
tasty
and
drinkable
it
sits
nicely
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
mix
of
malts
and
hops
the
balance
is
good
there
is
a
slight
off
taste
and
aftertaste
that
could
be
attributed
to
sitting
a
long
time
on
the
shelf
but
i
think
it
is
fresh
it
just
tastes
that
way
open
opening
the
bottle
and
smelling
the
piney
aroma
wafting
upward
i
assumed
this
would
be
a
hop
dominated
amber
in
fact
it
is
a
mild

flavorful
ale
this
is
very
quaffable

so
dead

the

all
take

nothing
bad
to
say
here
overall
im
missing
beers
like
this
that
have
great
flavor
complexity
that
got
me
into
craft
beers
that
are
so
good
yet
often
overlooked
much
appreciated
red
ale
from
the
folks
out
around
slo
and
santa
barbara
brewing
world
class
ales
abound
o
not
objectionable
but
quite
forgettable
it
does
cross
my
mind
to
wonder
how
old
the
beer
is
its
only
quite
recently
been
available
in
fl
so
i
assume
its
fairly
fresh
i
really
wish
all
breweries
would
date
their
bottles
bottle
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
medium
white
head
floral
spicy
and
mild
banana
aroma
hints
of
earth
and
citrus
caramel
with
some
light
anise
caramel
malt
blended
with
earthy
bitterness
hint
of
grapefruit
clean
dry
finish
pleasant
and
refreshing
but
just
a
hint
of
astringency
keeps
it
from
high
marks
o
i
love
this
stuff
but
its
been
kinda
hard
to
find
glad
i
came
across
it
overall
this
along
with
their
ipa
are
both
solid
and
tasty
brews
nothing
over
the
top
but
a
nice
balanced
fruity
and
hoppy
taste
id
drink
it
again
d
not
bad
but
the
hop
profile
is
very
old
fashioned
with
floral
notes
that
dont
really
stack
up
against
the
pine
and
tropical
fruit
that
most
west
coast
brewers
are
using
in
their
hoppy
red
beers
today
drinkable
but
forgettable
either
im
warming
up
slowly
to
the
hoppier
brews
or
im
finding
some
really
subtle
brews
in
that
style
im
surprised
at
the
lower
ba
score
as
i
feel
this
is
a
really
smooth
and
great
tasting
brew
the
only
thing
that
i
might
object
to
would
be
the
lowered
abv
of
which
ive
become
accustomed
to
o
this
was
maybe
not
so
surprisingly
good
its
nothing
mind
blowing
however
its
really
wellconceived
and
constructed
and
that
should
be
recognized
first
i
could
be
rating
this
lower
than
it
deserves
single
finger

otherwise
very
similar
this
is
like
a

as
far
as
hoppiness
degree
good
hop
degree
but
too
much
metallic
flavor
medium
body
and
moderate

very
drinkable
good
flavor
better
than
i
was
expecting
overall
sessionable
delicious
a
great
representation
of
the
style
im
so
glad
that
nectar
ales
has
made
its
way
to
florida
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
the
body
has
just
enough
heft
to
it
while
the
carbonation
level
makes
it
go
down
easy
the
drinkability
is
also
great
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
more
traditional
american
reds
ive
had
in
a
while
its
not
hopped
to
the
point
of
being
an
ipa
as
is
trendy
right
now
instead
it
provides
an
excellent
balance
of
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hops
to
make
a
truly
tasty
and
easydrinking
brew
appearance
is
amber
in
color
with
a
healthy
head
at
pour
some
lacing
on
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
particularly
noteworthy
smells
hoppier
than
anticipated
nice
piney
aroma
flavor
leans
more
towards
malts
and
the
hops
fade
to
the
back
a
hint
of
molasses
good
for
a
red
ale
but
tempts
with
the
hoppy
aroma
overall
a
good
balance
m
medium
bodied
easy
drinking
overall
not
my
favorite
red
ale
but
a
very
good
one
none
the
less
i
can
easily
get
this
one
and
will
visit
it
again
solid
d
very
drinkable
really
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
hop
profile
and
bitterness

a
clear
dark

a
1
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a

on

of
the

small
patches
of
lace
form
around
the

on
the

down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
herbal

aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
burnt
caramel
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
likely
go
after
again
i
cant
say
i
would
buy
this
again
the
flavor
is
fine
but
theres
just
not
much
of
it
c
a
good
brew
maybe
a
bit
syrupy
in
the
feel
throughout
it
was
ok
overall
ive
had
it
before
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
rated
it
id
still
probably
still
give
it
another
go
o
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
decent
example
i
didnt
like
the
astringent
thing
going
on
in
the
flavor
profile
after
awhile
i
got
sorta
tired
of
it
overall
though
i
liked
the
beer
and
id
buy
it
again
if
the
price
was
right
pours
a
clear
copperbrown
color
with
a
tan
1
fingerhead
minimal
lacing
only
a
few
spots
retain
smells
like
cherries
lemon
zest
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
flavors
of
cherry
caramel
faint
chocolate
lemon
zest
and
faint
pine
finishes
clean
with
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
decent
red
o
not
bad
a
good
one
to
pair
with
food
or
while
fishing
an
average
beer
for
an
average
occasion
overall
this
was
ok
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
again
but
glad
to
try
it
this
beer
just
lacked
depth
and
character
it
was
very
light
i
could
polish
off
a
6
pack
of
these
without
a
problem
and
in
a
pretty
quick
time
period
meh
another
average
red
what
can
i
say
nice
red
color
but
the
smell
left
something
to
be
desired
like
an
aroma
ok
maybe
i
smelled
some
malt
but
was
seriously
too
subtle
taste
was
borign
as
well
nothing
stood
out
i
guess
i
could
knock
this
back
ata
barbeque
but
i
wont
buy
anymore
of
it
doa
notes
a
very
solid
beer
all
the
way
through
cheers
it
also
doesnt
sit
well
as
the
second
half
was
a
little
stronger
so
chill
it
properly
and
dont
take
too
long
to
finish
it
and
itll
be
a
solid
enough
drink
from
what
i
remember
about
this
beer
is
the
taste
it
wasnt
the
best
or
a
fav
of
mine
but
it
was
drinkable
think
i
had
it
during
a
sit
down
while
trying
new
beers
and
it
was
just
ok
little
different
been
a
red
ale
or
hemp
ale
but
thats
how
it
was
different
in
its
own
way
try
it
out

some

and
a

kick
at

light
to
medium
bodied
not
complex
but
satisfactory
amber
ale
o
the
fresh
malt
and
gentle
hop
support
really
make
this
a
great
session
beer
and
the
depth
of
malt
holds
my
interest
for
sever
glasses
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
uniquely
crafted
beer
unlike
any
ive
sampled
to
date
id
give
a
5
for
originality
but
with
all
things
said
a
4
overall
is
worthy
o
doesnt
cut
it
too
little
aroma
and
flavor
i
like
bolder
beers
like
troegs
hopback
much
better
amber
overall
its
a
simple
yet
balanced
red
ale
that
i
would
buy
again
if
found
locally
pretty
decent
hoppy
red
a
bit
more
body
and
malt
this
might
be
a
real
winner
but
as
is
not
really
something
ill
seek
out
again
overall
a
rock
solid
amber
nothing
extraordinary
in
my
opinion
but
certainly
not
a
beer
id
shy
away
from
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
sunny
day
with
the
bbq
going
in
my
opinion
id
drink
it
again
killer
amber
pours
dark
dark
red
almost
burned
in
color
with
a
smal
tan
head
smells
a
bit
dry
like
an
irish
red
but
has
some
noticable
hops
in
the
nose
tastes
deep
and
rich
and
ancient
not
sweet
at
all
although
the
malts
leave
some
residual
sugars
its
all
pretty
tame
like
a
conversation
with
an
old
man
who
has
seen
it
all
this
beer
is
experienced
and
well
refined
very
very
sessionable
and
good
with
grilled
sausage
nice
spin
on
a
red
ale
hard
to
describe
just
try
it
a
drinkable
red
that
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
old
memories
but
a
sessionable
offering
to
be
sure
a
nice
brew
but
one
that
i
would
pass
over
in
a
situation
where
there
were
others
available
to
me
the
hop
bittering
is
rather
muted
for
this
style
at
least
what
i
think
of
this
style
some
nice
aspects
but
the
dry
woody
aspect
doesnt
quite
deliver
for
me
still
a
well
crafted
brew
that
will
appeal
to
malt
oriented
fans
coppery
colored
mildly
bitter
nearlyjuicy
brew
that
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
doesnt
raise
a
ruckus
or
overstay
its
welcome
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
in
the
aftertaste
but
very
approachable
up
front
i
would
not
have
a
problem
downing
a
few
of
these
in
succession
as
i
finish
the
glass
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
is
the
loudest
thought
left
in
my
mind
but
certainly
not
cloying
or
heavy
on
the
palate
refreshing
and
tasty
for
sure
a
nice
hoppy
read
ale
well
done
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
red
ale
not
surprised
that
nectar
ales
did
another
good
ale
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
spieglau
nonic
022811
indicated
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
copper
hue
with
a
semitranslucent
clarity
and
a
loose
quarter
inch
tancolored
head
embedded
with
ringlets
nose
expresses
caramel
malt
citrus
and
a
faint
earthiness
taste
reveals
an
earthy
bitterness
citrus
rind
and
a
suggestion
of
light
malt
but
no
caramel
flavors
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
coarse
carbonation
and
citrus
astringency
that
leaves
a
light
burn
along
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
balance
is
a
bit
off
not
sure
if
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
bottle
but
theres
a
little
too
much
acidity
and
bitterness
for
my
liking
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
its
got
an
interesting
taste
and
the
taste
itself
is
pretty
decent
a
pleasant
brown
ale
but
not
among
my
favorites
mediumbodied
not
that
interesting
kind
of
a
meh
beer
super
simple
red
ale
along
the
lines
of
fat
tire
not
at
all
bad
just
not
rememberable
o
decent
balance
a
little
to
earthy
for
my
liking
dthe
flavor
profile
is
a
little
weak
and
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
help
it
at
all
this
poured
out
with
a
nice
red
color
a
light
tan
colored
head
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
along
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
has
some
hop
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
seemed
a
lot
like
an
ipa
the
other
flavors
are
sweet
like
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
well
balanced
and
pleasing
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
enjoyable
o
this
is
an
average
beer
not
meant
to
be
the
most
complex
or
cater
to
the
craft
beer
enthusiast
easy
enough
to
drink
and
not
overly
strong
or
offensive
to
reach
for
a
couple
more
very
functional
for
what
it
is
a
decent
beer
not
one
to
chase
o
overall
it
was
pretty
good
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
o
honestly
would
be
a
pretty
solid
beer
if
not
for
the
tea
flavor
its
really
overpowering
and
detracts
from
it
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
reminds
of
a
newcastle
or
something
simalar
to
that
decent
brew
overall
odwell
i
will
definitely
say
this
this
beer
is
pretty
underrated
the
individual
flavor
and
the
good
aroma
are
quite
attractive
i
love
the
almost
herbal
tealike
qualities
of
this
beer
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
seeing
that
a
6pack
in
ma
is
about
12
50
i
will
not
be
shelling
out
the
money
to
buy
a
sixpack
but
this
beer
is
well
above
decent
in
my
book
it
pours
mahogany
red
with
a
qucik
head
burst
that
dissipates
in
short
order
the
aroma
is
is
a
festival
of
floral
earth
fallen
rotted
trees
in
the
forest
malts
and
hops
it
is
rather
interesting
the
body
is
about
medium
the
taste
is
also
bitterly
hopped
o
a
decent
red
ale
the
dark
color
would
lead
one
to
think
the
body
is
a
bit
heavy
that
it
comes
across
either
way
id
have
another
one
the
taste
is
well
balanced
nice
malt
up
front
that
lasts
until
the
swallow
where
the
peppery
hop
takes
over
low
carbonation
that
matches
the
appearance
and
the
liquor
is
decently
rich
overall
this
is
a
very
easytodrink
amber
with
an
interesting
journey
through
the
flavor
profile
in
each
sip
o
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
really
good
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
whole
evening
pours
a
standard
one
finger
head
barely
off
white
there
are
a
fair
amount
of
big
bubbles
but
underneath
that
there
are
small
bubbles
the
head
has
already
dissipated
quite
a
bit
which
kinda
sucks
but
oh
well
the
lacing
isnt
that
great
decent
at
best
the
body
is
a
deep
ruby
color
very
dark
for
an
amber
beer
it
really
looks
like
a
scotch
ale
or
an
irish
red
a
lot
more
than
it
looks
like
an
american
amber
the
carbonation
is
very
low
maybe
even
too
low
well
see
overall
this
is
an
interesting
look
very
unusual
and
unique
im
not
super
impressed
but
ill
give
it
points
for
being
different
slightly
hoppy
on
the
smell
with
a
small
malt
scent
to
it
as
well
its
clearly
a
light
beer
it
smells
very
refreshing
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
i
may
detect
some
fruit
but
its
very
small
if
any
is
there
overall
it
just
smells
very
smooth
and
tasty
im
not
expecting
this
to
be
off
the
charts
with
flavor
just
really
tasty
and
easy
drinking
well
on
the
taste
i
dont
know
what
to
say
i
remember
this
beer
being
a
lot
more
nectarlike
when
i
first
had
this
beer
i
could
tell
why
they
called
it
red
nectar
but
now
i
dunno
it
just
tastes
like
a
pretty
standard
ale
to
me
i
mean
there
might
be
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
nectar
or
fruit
like
but
not
much
it
is
very
smooth
and
it
has
a
really
nice
balance
between
malt
hops
and
just
being
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
the
most
impressive
beer
in
terms
of
the
style
i
dont
know
either
because
its
really
skimping
out
on
the
hops
for
an
amber
ale
with
that
being
said
its
obviously
supposed
to
be
a
sweeter
amber
so
i
can
cut
it
some
slack
because
i
know
where
they
were
trying
to
go
with
this
beer
did
they
get
there
not
really
its
not
as
smooth
as
nectar
or
anything
is
it
good
sure
but
by
no
means
as
good
as
i
thought
it
was
the
first
time
still
its
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
as
for
mouthfeel
its
ok
like
i
said
this
beer
isnt
as
big
as
i
want
it
to
be
but
i
can
cut
it
some
slack
because
i
know
its
supposed
to
be
a
lighter
sweeter
amber
ale
with
that
being
said
the
mouthfeel
isnt
that
great
carbonation
is
good
but
the
body
is
just
too
thin
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
probably
the
best
factor
in
this
beer
it
goes
down
very
well
and
its
very
smooth
and
refreshing
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
only
good
not
much
more
than
that
o
a
very
nice
red
ale
eh
not
a
terribly
exciting
brew
nor
a
particularly
wellcrafted
one
i
feel
its
drinkable
enough
but
there
are
far
better
examples
available
surely
everywhere
that
this
one
is
available
o
i
like
this
beer
i
really
look
forward
to
having
my
friends
try
it
as
it
seems
like
a
crowd
pleaser
but
its
not
boring
overall
not
bad
some
nice
flavors
lighter
decent
hops
decent
malts
nothing
crazy
a
bit
low
on
the
carbonation
and
the
color
is
just
way
out
there
d
pretty
drinkable
might
get
this
again
could
make
a
good
session
beer
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
great
session
brew
liked
this
alot
second
brew
from
these
folks
like
what
im
seeing
o
overall
a
good
amber
ale
but
nothing
too
special
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
and
nothing
really
stood
out
about
it
very
simple
flavors
that
are
quite
enjoyable
after
a
hard
days
workand
you
need
a
tasty
yet
unassuming
beer
to
slake
your
thirst
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
my
favorite
i
could
have
another
one
easy
drinking
and
a
tasty
beer
felt
it
was
time
for
some
nectar
yeah
this
color
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
pine
grapefruit
toffee
orange
peel
and
a
tiny
touch
of
leek
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
peel
sweet
toffee
and
light
pine
sap
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
heavy
light
and
light
medium
otherwise
known
as
discord
and
rhyme
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
an
okay
brew
nothing
close
to
spectacular
but
drinkable
enough
to
get
by
on
its
own
in
the
big
city
i
could
see
putting
this
in
my
normal
6pack
rotation
for
when
i
want
something
lighter
to
drink
would
definitely
have
again
drinkability
this
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
a
great
begginera
beer
for
people
interested
in
trying
a
microbrew
color
is
a
lightish
amber
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
aroma
is
nice
malty
light
hops
flavor
is
the
same
easy
to
drink
not
too
hoppy
good
but
not
great
drinkability
is
very
easy
however
and
ive
enjoyed
a
lot
of
these
in
the
last
week
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
the
cleaner
finishing
beers
i
have
had
in
awhile
abv
makes
this
sessionable
nice
beer
would
do
again
red
nectar
is
a
simple
enough
name
and
a
simple
enough
beer
the
look
on
this
is
a
mix
between
red
and
bronzeorange
as
well
its
a
red
ale
alright
a
hard
pour
yielded
only
a
cap
of
burnt
sugar
color
no
lace
smell
is
typical
for
the
style
meaning
simple
plae
malts
caramel
on
top
of
some
earthy
hops
a
bit
of
a
candy
like
scent
coming
through
as
well
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
caramel
and
some
apple
with
some
earth
hop
bitterness
thats
not
bitter
at
all
now
that
i
think
about
it
once
again
simple
feel
is
medium
with
light
carb
kinda
boring
needs
more
pizazz
i
drank
the
bottle
i
enjoyed
this
but
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
not
when
nugget
nectar
is
right
around
the
corner
but
all
in
all
this
hit
the
spot
refreshing
wise
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
without
too
much
lacing
nose
brings
some
citrus
and
pine
notes
with
a
bit
of
a
floral
character
taste
is
mostly
hops
as
well
with
some
lightlytoasted
malt
coming
through
in
the
background
good
bitter
feel
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
drinks
well
and
is
quite
sessionable
ruddy
auburn
pour
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
single
finger
head
the
head
leaves
behind
a
sticky
thin
lace
the
hop
aromas
are
the
most
prevelant
with
some
candy
sweetness
from
malts
underlying
the
hop
flavors
are
wonderful
both
piney
and
citrusy
the
malt
character
of
the
beer
is
noticable
along
with
some
notes
of
grass
and
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
but
not
syrupy
a
real
nectar
quality
the
slickness
of
the
brew
makes
for
easy
drinkin
as
does
the
lowish
abv
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
and
all
year
that
buttery
feel
combined
with
the
relatively
low
abv
made
this
a
beer
that
reminded
me
of
sierra
nevada
without
being
as
light
or
as
having
as
strong
an
aftertaste
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
not
like
anything
else
out
there
that
i
can
currently
place
on
a
retail
shelf
for
the
warm
days
and
cool
nights
that
are
characteristic
of
this
time
of
the
year
this
fits
in
perfectly
this
is
good
beer
some
reviewers
could
call
it
average
for
the
style
but
i
would
hate
to
call
this
beer
anything
less
than
good

would
drink
again
but
would
not
buy
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
have
again
in
fact
at
least
5
more
times
drinkability
this
beers
not
tough
to
drink
but
just
lacks
that
second
layer
of
complexity
that
really
wows
you
its
a
decent
beer
simply
put
and
one
could
make
okay
session
in
that
it
gives
you
bit
flavor
with
out
having
to
take
to
much
though
grew
on
me
a
bit
as
i
went
on
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
touch
watery
but
finishes
well
and
is
quite
drinkable
this
beer
is
like
an
old
horse
not
as
good
as
you
would
expect
but
reliable
and
every
so
often
pleasantly
surprising
overall
a
different
red
ale
with
a
nice
flavor
though
it
is
nothing
amazing
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
is
still
enjoyable
a
very
solid
amber
overall
no
hopback
or
nugget
more
bready
malts
to
it
and
the
hop
taste
is
less
strong
but
the
bitterness
is
near
even
with
the
hopback
the
only
fault
i
can
give
red
nectar
is
the
price
expect
to
pay
between
9
and
12
for
a
six
pack
im
surprised
no
one
has
posted
a
pic
yet
i
bought
it
because
the
bottle
was
so
beautiful
will
have
to
post
one
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
to
me
this
beer
has
its
highs
and
lows
the
high
is
the
nose
the
low
is
the
appearance
and
the
tastes
is
just
so
so
i
would
rather
this
beer
have
a
bit
more
head
retention
than
it
does
for
my
personal
taste
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
fine
beer
price
is
usually
7
99
or
more
which
is
a
little
more
than
i
would
desire
to
spend
on
this
stuff
not
a
ripoff
not
a
deal
overall
a
well
crafted
good
beer
that
makes
a
nice
session
beer
and
its
quite
refreshing
a
nice
summer
and
spring
beer
d
this
is
a
good
session
beer
for
springsummer
its
basic
enough
to
down
a
few
and
tasty
enough
to
sip
again
for
me
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
balanced
in
the
malthop
depeartment
but
overall
not
to
shaby
not
a
lot
going
on
here
but
very
pleaant
nonetheless
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
afternoon
down
by
the
lake
d
this
one
really
impresses
me
even
though
it
doesnt
technically
qualify
as
a
session
beer
still
id
have
no
problem
having
multiples
of
these
in
one
night
clean
finish
is
the
key
for
me
here
since
this
beer
possesses
a
richness
in
taste
that
doesnt
saturate
the
taste
buds
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
good
this
one
goes
down
real
well
and
i
would
consider
it
a
session
beer
for
me
even
if
it
is
too
high
in
abv
for
the
mathematicians
in
our
group
nice
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
pours
a
deep
but
luminous
amber
with
good
clarity
and
a
very
thick
meringuelike
head
that
jiggles
nicely
nose
has
a
nice
mix
of
citrusy
hop
aromas
along
with
a
whiff
of
candied
aromas
in
the
background
on
the
palate
theres
a
sweet
toffee
component
that
is
behind
this
nice
citrusy
hops
as
well
as
a
black
tea
resemblance
overall
finish
is
somewhat
thin
and
light
drinkability
above
average
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
as
i
expect
from
firestone
walker
the
pony
bar
manhattan
poured
a
deep
amber
red
into
an
american
pint
glass
which
looked
ruby
when
held
up
to
a
candle
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
which
laced
fairly
well
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
malt
and
caramel
with
some
hints
of
leather
and
oak
however
the
flavor
revealed
more
of
a
subtle
bitter
hop
presence
and
a
nice
dry
finish
the
big
pleasant
aspect
of
this
beer
that
hit
me
was
the
balance
between
hops
and
malt
there
wasnt
any
one
dominating
essence
or
a
pronounced
flavor
progression
in
the
beer
just
a
nice
rich
malthop
balance
throughout
the
body
was
borderline
mediumthick
but
very
smooth
and
pleasant
might
be
a
little
too
thick
though
to
session
not
overly
complex
but
pleasant

the

this
is

the

go

a
very
drinkable
beer
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
at
the
capital
ale
house
in
richmond
va
on
a
warm
afternoon
it
has
a
clear
redrust
color
and
medium
white
head
there
is
a
good
caramel
malt
aroma
the
kind
that
gets
me
excited
to
take
my
first
sip
of
course
i
have
to
jot
down
notes
about
the
aroma
first
plenty
of
hops
in
the
flavor
also
some
molasses
and
maltiness
up
front
it
is
full
bodied
and
has
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
6packs
of
this
in
maine
overall
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
amber
there
are
so
many
other

in

that
are

better

d
this

not
a

definitely
weaker
in
every
category
than
the

crystal
clear
glowing
copper
with
a
finger
of
creamy
slightly
offwhite

eventually
leaves
a
nice
layer
atop
the
glass
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
some
dried
fruit
and
sticky
hops
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
upfront
and
finishes
with
a
nice
piney
bitterness
that
lingers
its
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
the
nose
on
this
is
fantastic
and
the
flavor
backs
that
up
very
tasty
stuff
i
just
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
here
overall
i
dont
think
id
want
to
session
this
one
though
one
glassbottle
is
a
nice
zinger
to
get
you
going
or
to
create
contrast
with
something
less
hoppy
i
do
like
my

with
more
malthop

as
much

an

an

a
strong
amount
of
bitter
hops
pushes
the
sweet
to
one
side
the
date
was
111208
which
i
believe
to
be
the
bottling
date
the
hops
held
up
well
for
a
five
month
old
beer
i
believe
the
appearance
and
aroma
suffered
from
the
age
still
a
easy
drinker
and
enough
hops
to
make
it
interesting
to
drink
this
ones
nicely
balanced
not
going

extreme
in
any

what
we

is

d

which
im
not

my

may
like
it
a

i
thought
the
aftertaste
was
not

good
a
little

and
medicine
like
why
is
this
beer
not

this
is
what
amberred
ale
should
taste
like
it
tastes

fresh
and

it
goes
down

with
good
malty
mouthfeel
but
with
a
thin

why
is
red
rocket
ale
an
arrogant
bastard
wannabe
on
the
top
ten
and
not
this
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
and
a
great
segway
beer
for
people
who
dont
think
they
like
hoppy
beers
this
beer
pours
a

with
a

head
that
rapidly
receeds
to
a
thin
line
leaving

and
a
hoppy
floralness
with
hints

the
initial
taste

meh
i
had
this
after
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
was
surprised
by
the
similarity
red
nectar
had
similar
dry
biscuit
malt
notes
with
light
toffee
and
a
spicy
hops
finish
the
sam
had
more
hops
flavor
up
front
with
a
hit
of
citrus
but
red
nectar
still
stood
out
as
a
clean
tasty
and
drinkable
session
ale
worth
a
try
is
you
like
other
dry
amber
ales
the
taste
is
similar
fairly
light
with
a
light
caramellyfruit
and
juice
quality
then
a
fair
amount
of
grapefruity
citrus
that
dominates
the
finish
it
is
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
the
light
body
and
has
only
a
light
grain
taste
with
a
hint
of
cracker
as
it
warms
a
bit
it
gets
a
little
smoother
and
more
complex
with
the
bitterness
slightly
more
balanced
and
with
a
light
earthyleaf
quality
as
well
overall
though
its
mostly
grapefruity
with
hints
of
juice
fruit
and
grain
and
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
the
light
simple
character
yet
still
with
decent
flavours
and
body
to
hold
up
well
d
an
excellent
amber
ale
with
good
drinkability
although
there
are
others
that
surpass
it
it
is
still
a
solid
goto
beer
that
doesnt
disappoint
this
poured
a
clear
dark
cherry
color
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
barley
malt
with
burnt
yeast
and
some
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
roasted
barley
malt
with
brown
sugar
and
fresh
wet
copper
hops
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
had
a
nice
clean
flavor
and
good
body
they
werent
kidding
when
they
called
it
nectar
with
the
generally
sweet
character
but
this
was
kept
in
good
moderation
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
red
ales
ive
had
even
if
its
not
terribly
bold
or
unique
drinks
fine
not
overwhelmingly
flavorful
an
okay
representation
of
the
style
middle
of
the
road
user
friendly
your
friends
that
dont
like
craft
brew
would
probably
like
it
nothing
wrong
with
that
drinkability
not
too
much
alcohol
in
it
plus
its
light
bodied
so
its
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
the
aroma
was
a
biscuity
malt
with
a
faint
hop
smell
the
taste
was
malty
and
real
amber
like
with
toasted
malts
ringing
true
it
was
semi
dry
in
the
mouth
and
tongue
overall
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
average
in
the
catch
all
category
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
it
has
a
fairly
low
abv
and
is
smooth
and
has
a
good
taste
making
it
very
sessionable
worth
checking
out
not
very
much
alcohol
in
the
beer
so
drinkability
is
naturally
pretty
high
all
and
all
this
beer
is
worth
a
shot
im
going
to
try
their
ipa
next
on
tap
at
99
bottles
in
santa
cruz
poured
into
a
pint
glass
amber
in
color
with
a
beige
head
of
about
2
fingers
height
some
lacing
and
decent
retention
aroma
is
caramel
with
some
pine
hoppiness
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
caramel
and
honey
set
the
basis
for
the
tangy
citrus
hops
to
lay
atop
smooth
and
easy
drinking
all
in
all
a
rather
drinkable
brew
nowhere
near
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
it
probably
would
be
more
appealing
to
me
if
it
didnt
look
so
darn
ugly
if
a
beers
appearance
are
not
high
on
your
list
then
youll
likely
enjoy
this
one
ill
probably
have
this
again
at
some
point
but
it
will
be
a
while
i
hadnt
seen
this
one
for
a
couple
years
so
i
picked
it
up
when
i
found
it
in
town
at
sumdat
farmers
market
still
impresses
now
as
it
did
then
excellent
version
of
the
style
d
im
sure
to
many
this
beer
is
worth
a
frequent
drink
but
ive
found
many
better
ambers
out
there
i
made
some
filet
mignon
the
other
night
with
some
asparagus
and
served
it
with
the
red
nectar
i
have
to
say
this
beer
goes
really
well
paired
up
with
meat
dont
take
my
word
for
it
try
it
yourself
great
drinkability
a
really
nice
red
i
wish
there
were
more
of
this
style
out
there
in
the
market
a
deep
maroon
reddish
pour
with
lasting
off
white
head
smell
is
a
nice
fragrant
sweet
hoppiness
taste
is
a
good
crisp
hop
flavor
kick
at
first
with
light
bitterness
and
a
smooth
clean
quick
finish
without
much
lingering
flavor
overall
a
really
good
amber
that
id
buy
again
if
i
could
get
it
here
in
austin
cheers
d
full
rich
delicious
certainly
worth
another
easy
to
drink
and
good
to
savour
a
little
i
can
see
this
being
something
i
will
get
as
long
as
it
is
available
on
tap
and
then
perhaps
switch
over
d
wouldnt
be
bad
were
it
not
for
the
odd
aftertaste
cant
see
a
reason
to
try
this
one
again
sorry
no
recos
here
but
if
youre
eating
a
burger
and
you
need
something
to
wash
it
down
with
by
all
means
grab
one
d
very
nice
would
give
this
one
another
shot
pours
a
rich
copper
hue
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
very
thin
layer
of
bubbles
stickiness
is
thin
but
there
smell
is
um
birdfood
some
hints
of
caramel
and
earth
in
the
nose
as
well
as
a
woody
hop
aroma
interesting
taste
is
a
big
improvement
after
putting
my
nose
into
this
one
rusty
caramel
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
weak
citrus
sweetness
a
buttered
bread
taste
with
mild
lemongrass
aftertaste
pretty
light
to
medium
body
with
a
crisp
carbonation
a
pretty
baic
ale
it
just
seems
to
be
missing
that
west
coast
kick
thanks
for
the
bottle
josh
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
and
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
solid
brew
overall
id
have
it
again
overall
this
beers
greatest
virtue
is
its
drinkability
it
isnt
terribly
complicated
as
most
ambers
generally
arent
but
its
so
well
balanced
that
once
you
start
you
can
easily
put
away
three
or
four
bottles
without
thinking
to
yourself
that
you
should
have
picked
up
that
ipa
youve
been
waiting
so
long
to
try
an
ideal
session
beer
it
has
a
copper
appearance
with
a
dense
short
head
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
very
malty
biscuity
and
bready
flavors
with
a
kiss
of
hops
now
comes
the
good
part
the
taste
good
malt
presense
light
tropical
and
piney
flavors
pop
around
in
the
back
and
a
hint
of
caramel
quite
a
tasty
red
ale
reminds
me
a
lighter
arrogant
bastard
this
beer
really
caught
me
off
guard
id
avoided
it
at
the
store
for
quite
a
while
as
judging
by
the
name
and
packaging
i
expected
it
to
be
a
fruit
beer
instead
its
one
of
the
boldest
amber
ales
ive
tried
nice
taste
and
enjoyable
ill
get
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
drank

in
about
ten

it

youre
doing

for
a

above
average
session
beer
daside
from
my
mild
gripes
above
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
this
is
still
quite
a
solid
drinking
beer
a
lot
of
others
beers
have
come
along
since
this
brew
but
this
is
one
of
those
that
led
the
way
from
me
especially
with
its
citrus
hop
focus
ultimately
this
beer
is
still
the
session
brew
that
i
remember
even
if
it
has
lost
some
of
its
once
cutting
edge
vibrancy
d
a
roasty
red
ale
that
is
not
undrinkable
with
pleasant
hops
and
a
spicy
peppery
essence
not

a

also
the
taste
is
a

a
letdown

still
good
a
somewhat
harsh
bitter
taste
to
it
thin
watery
and
a

oily
mouthfeel
medium

not
much
to
this

it
is
very
crisp
and
unoffensive
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
in
one
word
it
would
be
average
its
not
bad
but
dont

time

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
johns
market
tigard
or
this
is
a
clear
reddishorange
with
a
nice
tan
head
there
are
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
and
ok
lacing
nose
is
hoppy
and
sweet
taste
is
metallic
with
some
malts
not
nearly
as
much
hops
as
the
nose
theres
an
odd
grainy
aftertaste
thats
like
bitter
honey
complicated
taste
but
not
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
ok
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
werent
for
the
odd
cacophony
of
the
taste
good
drinking
red
ale
nothing
spectacular
mind
you
but
solid
a
nice
hoppy
beer
recommended
overall
a
very
acceptable
brew
pours
a
deep
amber
with
modest
head
that
dissipates
quickly
modest
hops
well
blended
nothing
stands
out
as
unforgettable
but
seems
a
good
session
brew
goes
down
smooth
brewed
by
nectar
ales
paso
robles
california
whats
up
with
the
difference
from
humboldt
the
mouthfeel
is
its
only
real
fault
this
is
stll
an
excellent
beer
d
nice
easy
drinker
that
is
very
sessionable
red
nectar
is
bigger
than
many
of
the
red
ales
available
which
sometimes
tend
to
be
big
on
color
and
light
on
taste
this
one
has
some
promise
and
is
mostly
ok
no
flavors
truly
stand
out
though
there
is
a
nutty
sweetness
midsip
that
bleeds
into
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
easy
to
drink
but
as
soon
as
youve
swallowed
you
forget
what
the
beer
tasted
like
notes
well
it
is
what
it
is
an
amber
that
is
on
the
aggressive
side
of
things
still
maintaining
its
ultra
drinkability
in
the
process
priced
fairly
at
trader
joes
this
is
a
staple
type
offering
on

at
zenos
in

college
pa
pours
a
clear

rubyamber
with
a
very
small
slightly
offwhite
foamy

hardly
any
lacing
smell
is
of
moderate
malt
and
light
pine
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
tastewise
theres
much
more
of
a
hops
presence
that
the
nose
suggests
pine
citrus
rind
and
caramel
with
a
light
berry
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
soft
carbonation
nothing
here
that
wows
me
but
its
a
nice
evenly
balanced
refreshing
ale
very
drinkable
perfect
for
the
summer
time
weather
great
for
any
season
doesnt
compare
to
ruedrichs
red
seal
ale
i
am
happily
savoring
every
last
drop
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
this
is
absolutely
brilliant
wonderfully
balanced
fully
delivering
every
gram
of
flavor
held
within
just
a
very
average
beer
of
this
style
in
my
opinion
i
dont
know
if
they
actually
used
honey
in
this
beer
but
to
me
it
was
distinct
and
distracting
for
the
style
bottle
22oz
pours
an
amber
color
with
scents
of
malt
not
a
brew
that
youll
remember
but
not
a
brew
that
you
hated
drinking
either
middle
of
the
road
not
overly
hoppy
or
malty
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
but
if
it
got
in
my
way
id
have
it
again
thanks
to
zorro
for
the
bottle
uninteresting
but
not
overly
terrible
not
one
i
would
seek
out
all
natural
or
not
not
to
strong
but
kind
of
filling
goes
down
easily
i
definitely
recommend
especially
to
those
that
love
malt
the
pour
is
an
attractive
amber
with
a
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
malts
and
light
citrus
hop
presence
im
picking
up
a
ton
of
crystal
malts
in
front
of
the
caramel
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
slightly
rough
i
cant
think
of
a
better
way
to
describe
it
the
floral
and
citrus
hops
come
in
at
end
to
turn
this
unnecessarily
sweet
stuff
into
a
quaffable
session
beer
drinkability
is
good
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
as
i
really
would
rather
base
a
review
on
two
or
three
beers
over
time
than
on
a
one
and
only
good
feeling
brew
slightly
acidic
aftertaste
lingers
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
brew
or
a
with
dinner
beer
drinkability
i
wouldve
made
it
a
session
though
i
wanted
to
try
other
beers
a
tasty
and
pretty
singular
style
i
think
on
the
red
ale
pretty
drinkable
brew
itd
make
a
nice
session
ale
not
exactly
what
i
go
for
usually
but
decent
not
a
bad
ale
at
all
pretty
drinkable
and
a
solid
competitor
for
the
region
i
found
this
ale
very
drinkable
would
indeed
make
a
nice
session
ale
this
is
an
easy
drinking
amber
that
is
pretty
well
balanced
this
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
compare
to
red
seal
i
cant
really
give
it
higher
in
drinkability
cause
i
dont
particularly
care
for
it
it
seems
something
out
of
balance
to
me
why
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malts
to
my
palate
thats
like
having
a
safety
orange
dress
with
lime
green
polka
dots
uh
i
mean
that
i
dont
think
that
the
flavors
go
very
well
together
pours
an
absolutely
gorgeous
red
colorreally
lives
up
to
the
label
and
name
low
malty
aroma
good
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
clean
though
dry
finish
good
full
malty
body
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
had
not
heard
of
this
before
so
it
was
a
nice
treat
thanks
to
the
trade
from
biglove
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
clean
and
crisp
i
could
session
this
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
moderate
white
head
smell
is
very
strong
of
hops
and
a
mild
texture
of
malt
taste
is
an
enjoyable
bitterness
with
a
strong
dry
finish
that
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
so
much
so
that
i
finished
the
glass
before
the
review
good
beer
drinkability
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
but
havent
visited
it
in
at
least
a
few
years
great
different
ale
very
tasty
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
aroma
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
bisquit
malts
along
with
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
and
bitter
hop
flavor
with
a
fine
malty
base
it
is
a
little
hop
heavy
but
thats
what
i
like
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
red
ale
it
has
a
good
maltly
flavor
along
with
excellent
hop
characteristics
this
is
a
fine
sessions
brew
this
is
a
very
mellow
beer
and
it
goes
down
well
i
really
like
that
it
is
not
blatant
in
any
one
flavor
but
instead
makes
me
think
of
a
relaxing
spring
day
outside
maybe
im
getting
a
little
too
poetic
here
but
i
know
ill
be
buying
this
beer
again
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
the
drinkability
is
alright
could
be
a
session
beer
if
one
is
used
to
commercial
session
stuff
a
nice
khaki
colored
head
nearly
fills
the
glass
before
falling
to
a
compact
layer
sitting
above
clear
medium
red
liquid
a
wonderful
fruit
and
sweettoasty
malt
nose
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
to
hop
bitterness
coupled
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
making
this
ale
very
easy
to
put
down
theres
just
enough

to
provide
lipsmacking

the
lightly
toasty
maltiness
underneath
it
without
being
super
hoppybitter
finishes
very
balanced
but
with
an
emphasis
on
the

here
one
helluva
drinkable
red
ale
i
dont
see
smell
or
taste
a
lot
to
criticize
red
nectar
isnt
in
st
rogue

league
but
then
what
is
this
is
just
damn
tasty
beer
its
as
simple
as
that
the
beer
as
it
spills
from
the
12

sets

find
at

more

not
a

turns
out
to
be
a

tasty

this
is
one
id
keep
in
the
fridge
for
the
times
im
in
the
mood
for
an

i
got
exactly
what
i

from
this
this
is
your

medium

toasted

malt
and
a

presence
in
both
flavor
and

very

nothing
very

a

brew

pine

give
this

the

is
able
to
maintain
its

throughout
i
found
this
one
very
enjoyable
and
very

this
would
be
a

ive
had
this

several

at

during

when
its

little

makes
this
beer
pretty

mabey
would
have
liked
a

to
it
but
all
in
all
a
good
beer
a
crystalclear
deepcopper
body
is
capped
by
a
short
but
creamy
offwhite
head
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
nice
but
sparse
rings
of
lace
the
aroma
offers
a
delicate
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
lightly
floral
citrusy
and
grassy
hops
the
body
is
medium
and
its
lightly
crisp
on

the

flavor
appears
more
distinct
in
the
finish
which
is
long
and
lingering
with
some
residual
malt
and
dry
bitterness
a
solid
drinkable
beer
this
brew
pours
with
a
deep
red
amber
with
a
thick
sticky
foamy
head
the
aroma
of
toffee
and
caramel
is
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
initial
dry
and
shows
little
of
what
the
round
aroma
promises
the
bitterness
is
mellow
round
and
quite
distinct
the
light
malt
grows
less
dry
toward
the
finish
and
ends
in
quite
a
nice
balance
with
the
hops
i
would
call
this
one
a
red
pale
ale
its
reddish
amber
in
color
and
translucent
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
died
quick
smell
is
of
sweet
maltiness
then
the
taste
kicks
in
some
crisp
hops
not
ipa
hoppy
but
nicely
hopped
nice
tartness
in
the
mouthfeel
actually
slightly
fuzzy
ive
tried
two
nectar
ales
from
humbolt
and
both
have
had
the
peach
fuzz
mouthfeel
and
an
overall
nice
quality
to
them
good
brew
but
a
bit
pricey
at
10
a
sixer
this
beer
poured
a
redrusty
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
in
it
very
clear
so
that
the
carbonation
was
very
visible
the
head
was
big
full
and
foamy
it
was
beigeoff
white
in
color
and
so
was
the
full
lace
that
was
left
behind
the
aroma
that
it
gave
off
seemed
to
be
fairly
faint
i
did
notice
hints
of
citrus
hops
fruit
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
honey
i
noticed
most
of
these
smells
when
i
took
the
glass
outside
in
the
crisp
clean
air
the
taste
was
semi
sweet
in
nature
hints
of
sweet
malt
some
honey
hops
and
a
bite
of
yeast
the
finish
left
a
slight
hop
semidry
feel
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
fairly
decent
beer
better
then
average
in
most
areas
i
would
probably
get
again
but
not
for
awhile
i
believe
there
are
other
beers
from
that
style
that
i
would
like
to
try
first
though
pours
a
nice
red
amber
with
a
tight
offwhite
colored
head
nice
lace
that
sticks
around
the
glass
on
the
nose
there
is
a
slight
caramel
aroma
slight
fruity
hop
aroma
as
well
on
the
palate
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
fruity
essences
honey
perhaps
slight
spicyherbal
notes
in
there
slight
caramel
malt
flavor
toogood
balance
overall
a
enjoyable
brew
at
first
sight
the
color
was
of
a
nice
reddish
amber
but
the
smell
was
not
that
impressing
the
aroma
of
hops
and
citrus
was
what
i
got
then
the
taste
was
of
hops
with
a
hit
of
citrus
that
was
all
that
i
could
taste
of
this
beer
also
there
was
a
feeling
of
a
sour
bitterness
in
my
mouth
not
impressed
with
this
beer
will
not
purchase
it
again
wheres
the
honey
very
red
in
color
but
it
was
cloudy
which
sort
of
spoilt
its
appearance
a
bit
moderate
but
acceptable
bitterness
with
a
really
nicely
balanced
malty
aftertaste
a
very
solid
beer
with
an
almost
silky
smooth
drinking
mouthfeel
so
good
i
had
another
i
tried
the
brace
of
humboldt
reds
on
draft
at
heroes
bar
in
claremont
ca
i
too
had
an
accompanying
meal
and
its
true
it
does
go
really
rather
well
with
food
especially
steak
had
this
today
with
grilled
cheese
sandwiches
accompanied
by
chips
and
salsa
it
was
a
perfect
pairing
cloudy
reddish
amber
nice
lasting
head
and
exceptional
lacing
coated
my
glass
bitterness
was
moderate
and
this
ale
went
down
very
smooth
good
solid
maltiness
provided
the
foundation
for
this
fine
drinkable
ale
i
think
i
have
found
a
new
staple
for
my
fridge
since
this
brewery
is
in
the
general
area
of
anderson
valley
and
north
coast
breweries
i
might
have
to
visit
them
soon
pours
a
nice
redamber
with
a
tight
off
white

that
sticks
around
well
smell
is
spicyherbal
hops
and
strong
honey
the
honey
makes
itself
known
right
at
the
start
with
a
nice
malt
character
as
well
as
the
malt
and
honey
fade
there
is
a
nice
spicyherbal
hop
character
that
develops
interesting
mouthfeel
im
not
exactly
sure
how
to
describe
it
but
it
is
nice
a
very
drinkable
brew
as
well
this
would
be
a
damn
fine
session
brew
if
it
was
more
readily
available
around
here
this
brew
came
as
a
pleasant
surprize

i
still
get
something
slightly
metallic
at
the
end
feel
is
right
where
it
should
be
for
the
style
i
like
hoppy
reds
and
overall
this
is
super
easy
drinking
and
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
o
tasty
reasonably
unique
tapioca
bubble
aroma
and
flavour
not
a
bad
one
to
have
in

of
you
my
wife
and
i
agree
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
red
ales
that
weve
had
will
have
to
try
this
one
again

a
tasty

with
a
slightly

nice
this
is
a
lovely
tasty
ale
reminiscent
of
a
lower
abv
version
of
brown
shugga
enjoyed
this
local
brew
being
down
in
florida
for
a
winter
getaway
shares
a
common
characteristic
with
jai
alai
as
all
cigar
city
beers
do
which
i
like
may
just
be
my
favorite
red
ale
jai
alai
and
some
of
the
other
cigars
are
very
abundant
here
i
didnt
know
about
this
and
wasnt
looking
for
it
it
took
a
while
to
stumble
upon
it
when
i
finally
did
it
was
at
a
large
gas
station
that
is
70
dedicated
to
craft
beer
times
are
achangin
o
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
i
could
see
drinking
this
one
after
the
other
without
much
difficulty
its
just
a
nice
sweet
malty
beer
that
is
very
smooth
very
impressive
red
didnt
expect
it
to
taste
as
good
as
it
did
tastes
as
it
smells
but
excellently
balanced
and
with
a
wonderful
yeast
profile
caramel
malt
sharp
hops
chewy
yeast
way
sessionable
especially
considering
its
abv
well
done
cc
this
a
hoppier
red
ale
not
especially
typical
of
the
style
though
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
reds
ive
had
good
balance
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
as
well
ive
seen
a
few
people
taste
it
for
the
first
time
and
open
their
eyes
wide
with
a
wow
o
i
was
surprised
by
this
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
typical
english
red
ale
its
quite
layered
with
some
complexity
and
nice
carbonation
has
done
fruit
elements
and
a
decent
bitterness
that
play
very
well
with
the
major
sweetnees
was
quite
satisfied
and
would
defiantly
drink
again
versitile
with
good
food
pairing
ranging
from
apple
pie
to
a
nice
pot
roast
liking
this
beer
a
red
ale
more
like
a
great
pale
ale
that
happens
to
have
a
reddish
color
enjoy
i
know
ill
be
having
more
this
is
one
of
my
top
amber
or
red
ales
and
i
have
tried
quite
a
few
after
the
initial
pour
this
is
one
solid
and
dangerously
drinkable
ale
you
would
never
know
this
ale
is
7
2
abv
overall
not
entirely
sold
on
this
it
is
good
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
a
harshness
to
the
hop
profile
wasnt
my
favorite
i
really
liked
this
one
nothing
huge
but
definitely
drinkable
and
tasty
wish
i
had
constant
access
to
it
delicious
orange
peels
malty
goodness
and
really
balanced
its
everything
an
imperial
red
ipa
should
be
a
very
ruddy
red
ale
with
hints
of
orange
in
the
pour
that
overweigh
the
browns
this
is
a
sugarynear
syrupy
red
that
nonetheless
is
wellcomposed
enough
to
escape
any
miring
in
its
thickness
instead
it
even
offers
limited
though
by
no
means
leaden
refreshment
via
its
boozy
wellbittered
flavorprofile
it
is
foremost
definitely
a
stickyass
beer
nonetheless
it
boasts
decent
complexity
and
does
a
very
nice
job
finishing
hitting
the
hoppy
acids
hard
and
late
on
the
tongue
aromatic
oils
have
been
mostly
boiledout
however
so
the
nose
possesses
a
distinct
maltwiney
nose
thats
a
bit
heavier
even
than
most
of
the
other
good
deepreds
ive
tried
any
retention
of
citric
or
floral
oils
is
expressed
through
the
aforementioned
stickiness
which
is
much
sappier
woodier
or
otherwise
more
vegetal
than
a
drinker
might
expect
even
from
a
big
red
like
this
overall
it
works
but
its
nonetheless
less
flexible
or
forallseasons
than
most
entrants
in
my
redale
wheelhouse
i
believe
it
is
in
large
part
a
function
of
this
being
a
very
straightup
red
not
especially
or
aggressively
hoppy
seemingly
without
any
latestage
or
dry
hopping
to
add
any
freshhopped
notes
and
not
hedging
at
all
with
an
adjunct
element
like
rye
to
add
spiciness
or
crunch
to
the
bigbody
of
the
swirlythick
malts
still
its
good
and
certainly
fairly
fecundwhich
i
guess
is
the
intellectual
link
between
the
beer
its
name
and
the
premising
patter
printed
on
the
side
of
the
can
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
amber
in
color
a
bit
hazy
thin
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
smell
is
mainly
citrus
a
lot
of
orange
juice
and
some
mango
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
follows
the
nose
a
nice
breadiness
in
there
although
the
malty
sweetness
is
a
tad
overwhelming
very
sharp
bitterness
it
could
be
a
bit
harsh
and
lingers
for
a
little
while
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
if
a
little
thick
overall
a
very
good
amber
the
hop
profile
is
very
similar
to
jai
alai
but
maybe
less
on
the
tropical
fruit
side
it
reminds
me
of
a
tamer
version
of
arrogant
bastard
had
this
at
the
tasting
room
took
a
couple
six
packs
with
me
back
to
california
great
aroma
with
balanced
hop
profile
all
the
way
through
and
a
malty
backbone
that
isnt
too
sweet
balanced
sweet
a
nice
hoppy
twinge
just
once
of
the
best
reds
out
there
in
the
conversation
with
lagunitas
imperial
red
hoppy
like
an
ipa
but
better
balanced
my
favorite
hippy
red
ale
very
good
red
ale
nice
hop
character
real
nice
red
ale
not
overly
hopped
sweet
malt
caramel

by
ccb
definitely
one
i
always
love
picking
up

type
can
quite
drinkable
one
of

best
which
is

review
is
from
a
can
purchased
at
cigar
city
brewing
approximately
two
weeks
after
canning
31414
consumed
on
8814
a
real
nice
red
ale
it
was
better
when
the
first
batches
rolled
off
the
line
with
an
accent
on
the
hops
and
the
malt
taking
a
backseat
this
one
is
much
more
balanced
which
to
this
hop
head
is
not
an
improvement
still
solid
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
this
is
an
outstanding
amber
ale
the
fresh
citrusy
hops
are
balanced
tremendously
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
if
this
were
regularly
available
to
me
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
rotation

a
well
put
together
beer
this
may
be
my
favorite
ccb
beer
mind
you
i
havent
had
many
of
their
whales
drinks
so
easy
this
is
a
fully
hopped
ale
with
tons
of
complexity
and
lots
of
flavor
o
very
enjoyable
red
ale
that
is
balance
with
pronounce
malt
and
hop
profiles
not
a
beginner
beer
for
a
red
ale
coming
in
at
over
7
abv
a
refreshing
ale
and
a
good
benchmark
for
this
style
though
im
not
that
prevalent
in
this
style
currently
let
me
start
by
saying
that
cigar
city
should
please
come
to
michigan
this
ale
pours
a
handsome
amber
red
color
with
a
generous
frothy
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
pour
it
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
balanced
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
hops
and
a
very
nice
amount
of
malt
it
is
sweet
but
bitter
all
at
once
the
body
is
medium
in
nature
with
a
lot
of
coating
of
hoppy
resin
and
sweet
malts
the
flavor
begins
with
an
ipas
generosity
of
hops
followed
by
the
sweet
balance
of
roasty
malts
this
is
a
delicious
ale
with
an
almost
unheard
of
amount
of
balance
thus
is
a
greatly
crafted
ale
from
a
brewer
that
is
quickly
impressing
me
more
and
more
o
this
a
nicely
balanced
red
ale
would
be
a
nice
one
to
have
6
or
12
on
the
boat
for
a
nice
day
of
fishing
tocobaga
drinks
ridiculously
easy
smells
good
and
tastes
great
i
could
do
with
more
citrus
notes
on
the
palate
and
a
more
explosive
nose
man
this
beer
is
fun
and
easy
to
drink
clean
pour
with
a
beautiful
amber
color
small
head
yet
unexpectedly
powerful
hoppy
aroma
for
a
red
ale
excellent
taste
starting
with
a
citrusy
hop
flavor
and
nice
malt
finish
finished
the
glass
with
the
bitter
hoppy
flavor
pleasantly
lingering
on
my
palate
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
in
spite
of
its
decent
abv
would
definitely
drink
again
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
opaque
suspended
sediment
filled
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
sparse
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
tangy
sweetness
tropical
fruit
sweetness
and
some
floral
hops
characteristics
flavors
are
tangy
sweet
forward
with
a
caramel
backbone
and
tart
grapefruit
and
pineapple
blend
as
well
as
some
earthy
notes
bitter
and
spiced
hops
profiles
and
bready
characteristics
very
layered
and
deep
especially
for
the
style
tasty
beer
the
body
is
full
which
i
was
expecting
after
watching
it
pour
and
settle
it
also
leaves
a
decent
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
the
aftertaste
leans
more
towards
an
ipa
with
tropical
fruit
heavy
on
the
grapefruit
and
pineapple
bitterness
and
pepper
spices
the
finish
is
slick
and
slightly
dry
with
bitter
and
subtle
richly
sweet
notes
this
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
i
like
it
a
lot
appearance
is
a
slightly
cloudy
fire
orange
with
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
deep
and
earthy
with
heavy
hop
character
in
the
form
of
tea
earth
and
pine
notes
of
caramel
malts
come
through
the
hop
profile
as
well
the
taste
starts
with
some
candied
malt
notes
and
is
followed
by
some
fruity
notes
of
tangerine
and
citrus
as
well
as
some
piney
notes
the
bitterness
builds
but
is
not
over
the
top
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
with
moderate
body
overall
solid
beer
with
nice
balance
between
assertive
hops
and
sweet
malts
overall
a
fantastic
beer
from
cigar
city
and
one
that
immediately
takes
its
place
amongst
my
preferred
offerings
in
the
style
i
could
see
this
particular
brew
appealing
both
to
amber
purists
who
love
that
chewy
malt
profile
and
hopheads
like
myself
who
prefer
their
caramel
malts
with
a
lupulin
glaze
a
tweener
if
you
will
oa
great
red
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
produced
the
balance
is
very
good
with
just
enough
hops
to
provide
a
nice
kick
to
the
malt
base
overall
this
is
a
smackable
brew
bread
malts
and
citrus
pair
up
very
well
in
this
brew
definitely
try
it
if
you
get
the
opportunity
o
i
really
enjoy
this
one
from
cigar
city
if
they
distributed
to
my
area
in
sc
i
would
pick
it
up
regularly
nice
and
hoppy
full
of
flavor
1010
will
drink
again
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
not
much
lacing
citrus
hop
and
caramel
dominate
the
nose
with
nice
bread
notes
coming
through
drinks
like
it
smells
citrus
and
caramel
upfront
with
moderate
breadiness
on
the
backend
well
balanced
finishes
malty
with
slight
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
even
though
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
beer
that
is
insanely
drinkable
ccb
continues
to
impress
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
lot
going
on
and
working
well
together
this
is
a
really
delicious
amber
ale
very
bready
yet
very
hoppy
with
a
nice
sweet
tone
to
it
if
you
dont
live
within
their
distribution
check
out
leukens
online
they
deliver
thats
how
i
got
mine
overall
definitely
a
nice
swig
very
balanced
but
both
malty
and
hop
character
are
allowed
to
shine
worth
a
try
for
sure
i
like
this
beer
its
more
spicy
than
anything
else
a
spicy
red
ale
is
something
i
dont
remember
having
before
but
im
really
enjoying
it
not
my
favorite
red
ale
or
ccb
worth
trying
though
o
a
delicious
beer
and
marks
very
well
except
for
the
floaties
tocobaga
achieves
a
nice
balance
of
deep
maltiness
and
hop
bitterness
and
remains
highly
drinkable
it
opened
up
nicely
as
the
beer
warmed
tocobaga
and
the
humidor
ipa
are
my
two
favorite
regular
cigar
city
beers
the
only
place
you
can
find
it
consistently
in
bottles
is
at
the
brewery
they
are
going
to
be
canning
both
beers
in
the
very
near
future
ccb
has
been
using
a
im
glad
i
live
a
couple
miles
away
overall
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
but
i
just
wish
that
its
flavor
lived
up
to
the
expectations
engendered
by
the
aroma
overall
strong
malt
and
caramel
backbone
hints
of
grapefruit
hops
an
ok
red
ale
nothing
mindblowing
i
will
mention
that
i
am
enamored
with
ccb
and
justifiably
so
but
figured
id
mention
as
a
caveat
to
my
review
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
grab
when
i
have
guests
in
town
to
try
the
local
brews
ive
never
had
someone
tell
me
they
didnt
think
it
was
very
good
o
another
hopped
up
red
ale
that
i
enjoyed
may
be
closer
to
a
imperial
red
ipa
so
damn
good
thank
you
grant
dried
dark
fruit
sweetness
up
front
medium
bodied
that
holds
up
well
to
the
carbonation
sticky
caramelized
glazed
dark
fruit
bowl
throughout
faint
citrus
hop
adds
a
touch
of
underlying
bitterness
but
for
the
most
part
the
sweetness
overrides
this
and
linger
slightly
very
clean
finish
and
smooth
beer
wish
it
showed
a
little
less
dark
fruit
along
with
the
hop
finish
slightly
dried
toast
flavor
to
help
dry
it
out
a
very
clean
and
very
drinkable
beer
though
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
alcohol
is
very
deceptive
as
you
cant
taste
it
at
all
and
it
could
easily
pass
as
a
5
abv
brew
11
49
for
a
6
pk
yep
a
pretty
typical
red
ale
all
over
reddish
amber
pour
with
a
foamy
cap
of
offwhite
bubbles
malty
aroma
with
some
piney
hops
coming
through
taste
of
caramel
malt
and
toffee
piney
hops
citrus
pith
somewhat
metallic
in
the
finish
pretty
average
even
for
the
style
but
still
a
good
brew
probably
overrated
just
because
its
cc
medium
body
and
decently
drinkable
aside
from
that
offflavor
which
could
just
be
a
freshness
issue
didnt
check
for
a
bottle
date
od
a
nice
strong
hoppy
red
drinkable
and
flavourful
enjoyed
the
amped
up
balance
good
stuff
this
is
a
stellar
red
ale
it
could
easily
be
considered
an
american
ipa
very
hop
forward
with
excellent
malt
balance
if
in
florida
seek
this
out
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
sniftertulip
hybrid
nice
reddish
hue
with
14inch
of
cream
head
that
lingers
upon
pouring
i
immediately
smelled
some
sweet
lightly
toasted
malts
after
taking
a
stronger
whiff
the
piney
hops
came
into
play
with
perhaps
some
floralgrassy
notes
this
red
ale
has
a
smooth
light
mouthfeel
with
a
good
but
not
overwhelming
malt
backbone
what
surprised
me
was
the
significant
hop
presence
in
the
finish
that
hung
around
for
a
bit
for
me
this
threw
off
the
overall
balance
and
was
a
bit
disappointing
for
the
style
i
think
the
hops
were
too
much
this
one
would
be
best
described
as
a
redamber
ale
trying
to
be
an
ipa
id
have
it
again
but
only
because
we
dont
get
cigar
city
in
il
if
it
was
available
in
il
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
leave
in
on
the
shelf
and
grab
a
bells
amber
ale
overall
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
higher
rated
ccb
brews
it
kills
the
competiton
in
the
amber
ale
category
certainly
not
an
ipa
but
a
great
hoppiness
nonetheless
just
another
top
shelf
beer
from
ccb
i
would
buy
this
stuff
regularly
if
i
had
access
to
it
poured
a
auburn
colored
body
with
good
head
on
top
of
a
classic
amber
ale
smell
of
sharp
citric
hops
and
some
distinct
caramel
malt
with
some
breadiness
even
hops
are
very
prevelant
in
the
taste
and
balance
well
with
the
sweet
caramel
malt
a
hoppy
dry
crisp
beer
in
a
lighttomedium
body
that
then
picks
up
a
little
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
snappy
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
for
more
a
great
example
of
a
red
ale
that
is
not
too
sweet
or
watery
and
overhopped
and
quite
enjoyable
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
tap
42s
cigar

good
beer
with
a
pretty
dark

color
really
likin
the
color
not

very
well

with
hops
and
citrus
notes

the
nice

feel

in

great
complexity
very
refreshing
a
surprise
to
find
on
the
shelf
on
vacation
and
i
hope
to
find
it
again
someday
overall
maybe
just
a
touch
too
sweet
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
but
a
great
american
amber
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
ithaca
cascazilla
but
better
cigar
city
makes
some
fine
brews
interestingly
i
had
this
right
after
a
bells
goes
to
11
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
they
are
very
similar
beers
which
i
was
not
expecting
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
more
with
plenty
more
complexity
that
coats
the
palate
with
flavor
that
goes
on
forever
so
so
good
with
the
bitterness
and
hop
profile
of
ipa
the
beer
is
tampered
by
a
balancing
malt
sweetness
starchiness
and
body
it
both
appeases
hop
heads
and
those
who
prefer
balance

styles
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
yet
another
winner
among
many
from
cigar
city
brewing
one
of
my
favorite
red
ales
my
wife
rocks
for
finding
me
a
couple
bottles
in
florida
over
her
christmas
break
it
borders
an
ipa
but
the
malty
notes
of
toffee
and
berry
help
it
stand
apart
good
stuff
here
and
well
worth
a
try
very
impressed
a
high
quality
red
ale
and
also
my
first
ever
brew
from
cigar
city
after
tasting
this
its
needless
to
say
that
ill
be
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
more
o
this
is
a
remarkable
beer
and
is
the
first
i
have
tried
from
ccb
looking
forward
to
many
more
if
they
are
half
as
good
as
this
one
a
red
ale
id
seek
out
again
recommended
looks
like
an
amber
or
red
ale
but
smells
3
75
like
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
with
the
hops
far
more
evident
than
the
malts
still
hoppy
for
style
in
tasting
with
at
least
as
much
hop
presence
as
the
surprising
nose
suggests
the
malt
is
a
bit
more
obvious
in
tasting
but
little
enough
to
leave
this
a
moderately
bitter
and
quite
hoppy
red
ale
relatively
high
abv
is
almost
completely
hidden
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
but
lends
some
harshness
to
the
feel
o
a
very
tasty
red
ale
the
bold
and
tropical
heavy
hops
and
kept
in
check
by
plenty
of
rich
bread
and
caramel
notes
great
beer
not
your
everyday
red
quite
good
overall
a
delicious
beer
that
is
a
surprisingly
good
red
ale
pleasant
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
long
bitter
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
of
the
ccb
beers
i
have
tried
thus
far
overall
alright
aroma
and
flavor
certainly
average
to
above
average
the
rest
however
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
and
really
reminds
me
of
a
couple
mediocre
batches
of
homebrew
ive
had
and
sometimes
brewed
in
the
past
id
bet
its
better
on
tap
but
a
bottles
what
ive
got
the
beer
is
deep
amber
almost
a
reddish
copper
in
color
theres
a
small
head
with
consistent
lacing
present
it
smells
crisp
with
clear
hints
of
hops
up
front
subtly
grapefruity
and
citrusy
very
wellbalanced
red
pleasant
hop
flavor
wo
being
too
overwhelming
some
additional
notes
of
sweet
fruit
like
a
pineapple
or
kiwi
muted
but
present
very
smooth
and
almost
a
silky
mouthfeel
a
little
dry
bite
on
the
backend
coming
from
the
red
ale
side
of
this
beer
overall
very
quality
and
completely
sessionable
overall
this
is
such
an
amazing
beer
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
spot
on
ive
always
wondered
if
cigar
city
beers
were
overrated
but
if
this
is
anything
to
go
by
theyve
earned
their
hype
overall
4
0
this
winds
up
being
a
surprisingly
mellow
beer
in
my
opinion
dont
get
me
wrong
its
plenty
hoppy
and
has
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
but
its
nicely
balanced
and
doesnt
harass
or
assault
the
palate
in
quite
the
way
jai
alai
can
also
it
seems
that
the
hop
profile
used
in
this
beer
fits
the
malt
body
surprisingly
well
and
in
a
way
that
suits
the
style
the
hop
profile
of
jai
alai
would
not
be
as
good
of
a
fit
for
this
beer
nor
would
tocobagas
hop
profile
be
as
good
of
a
fit
for
jai
alai
theyre
wellmatched
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
o
very
enjoyable
beer
got
this
one
down
pretty
easily
would
gladly
drink
again
thank
you

much
better
and
still
amazing
32
days
in
overall
pretty
good
nice
hop
presence
that
doesnt
get
overly
bitter
nice
malt
presence
as
well
that
gives
some
decent
flavors
and
backbone
a
touch
of
the
yeast
coming
through
as
well
a
well
done
beer
overall
most
amber
ales
dominate
with
caramel
sweetness
and
bring
along
the
hops
as
an
afterthought
this
one
turns
the
equation
inside
out
and
delivers
a
great
hop
profile
that
is
backed
up
by
the
caramel
highly
recommended
o
i
really
like
cigar
citys
beers
if
i
could
buy
them
here
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
j
nicely
blended
and
balanced
as
i
sip
high
drinkability
doesnt
bode
well
for
tomorrow
morning
between
this
the
orange
wood
ipa
and
huna
on
tap
tomorrow
will
be
rough
cheers
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
for
the
style
i
am
digging
it
it
might
even
be
close
to
the
legendary
nectar
nugget
by
troegs
its
seem
fairly
similiar
to
me
o
a
pretty
tasty
amber
ale
on
the
whole
i
suspect
this
isnt
all
that
fresh
and
id
probably
enjoy
it
more
if
it
were
id
also
probably
enjoy
it
more
if
it
were
drier
but
its
very
solid
overall
this
is
an
excellent
steppingstone
into
the
world
of
red
ales
before
drinking
this
beer
i
was
not
overly
excited
about
venturing
into
red
ales
but
now
i
could
not
be
more
eager
to
have
another
i
am
also
disappointed
that
this
was
my
only
bottle
this
is
a
beer
i
would
love
to
have
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
it
is
just
spectacular
17
520
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
pleasures
of
drinking
do
very
balanced
highly
drinkable
even
for
the
7
alcohol
didnt
know
about
this
one
until
recently
would
want
to
have
again
great
job
with
a
normal
beer
cigar
city
odreally
ecstatic
to
be
able
to
try
this
brew
unfortunately
i
was
a
bit
let
down
perhaps
this
was
a
bit
old
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
the
beer
in
its
current
state
was
tasty
and
balanced
but
i
wanted
more
from
this
brew
could
be
more
dynamic
i
will
search
this
one
out
again
and
make
sure
its
fresh
and
compare
score
will
be
edited
accordingly
i
can
think
of
no
red
ales
that
achieve
this
depth
and
body
nugget
nectar
aims
to
be
more
of
a
traditional
bitter
ipa
this
thing
goes
for
a
west
coast
super
tropical
fruit
amber
for
my
taste
this
is
preferred
to
the
famed
nn
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
just
think
it
was
perhaps
not
super
fresh
all
the
players
are
there
for
this
to
be
a
solid
brew
they
just
didnt
step
up
for
me
o
this
was
another
great
ccb
offering
not
my
favorite
beer
that
ive
ever
had
but
fantastic
for
a
red
ale
lots
of
flavor
and
easily
drinkable
if
anything
it
might
be
a
tiny
bit
too
sweet
definitely
recommended
trying
45
o
beautifully
crafted
beer
maybe
slightly
less
hops
with
a
touch
more
of
the
bready
flavor
would
have
made
it
epic
to
my
taste
buds
overall
one
of
the
best
red
ales
i
have
ever
had
cheers
o
very
good
hoppy
amber
hops
shine
but
the
flavor
is
balanced
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
i
think
i
would
revisit
time
and
time
again
once
again
cigar
city
brewing
makes
me
happy
to
live
in
florida
unfortunately
even
in
florida
this
beer
isnt
available
as
often
as
i
would
like
because
i
would
like
to
be
drinking
this
all
the
time
this
is
the
best
american
red
ale
available
and
my
favorite
of
cigar
citys
year
round
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
good
red
ale
its
hoppy
but
still
with
prominent
maltiness
cost
12
for
a
six
pack
the
really
wonderful
surprise
however
is
the
most
wonderful
toastedcherrylike
aftertaste
even
though
this
is
not
a
fruitflavored
brew
this
sweetish
aftertaste
and
the
bitter
hops
are
perfectly
balanced
fantastic
beer
edit
ive
updated
the
ratings
to
reflect
a
fresh
bottle
i
had
from
a
recent
batch
the
comparison
is
nearly
nonexistant
much
hoppier
more
citrus
character
and
the
malt
is
less
sticky
sweet
also
or
perhaps
as
a
result
the
alcohol
presence
is
significantly
decreased
much
improved
o
smelled
really
nice
but
taste
didnt
quite
deliver
for
me
overall
very
nice
flavors
without
anything
being
particularly
standout
good
stuff
o
impressed
by
this
beer
really
nice
leaves
me
with
a
really
good
look
on
ccb
beers
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
o
overall
a
very
god
example
of
the
style
really
tasty
with
good
drinkability
suprisingly
sessionable
considering
the
abv
i
recommend
4
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
my
immediate
reaction
to
this
brew
based
on
the
nose
and
secondly
confirmed
by
the
taste
was
that
this
is
floridas
answer
to
nugget
nectar
fans
of
hoppy
reds
or
imperial
reds
will
really
enjoy
this
nicely
done
cigar
city
i
would
enjoy
more
of
this
a
really
nice
red
i
like
the
malt
profile
and
the
citrus
hops
are
very
juicy
overall
a
red
ale
id
have
again
thanks
chris
unfiltered
reddish
brwon
with
an
offwhite
head
relatively
dense
lace
and
a
good
film
a
good
bit
of
malt
in
the
nose
caramel
and
some
a
bit
of
toasty
malts
grapefruit
and
some
darker
fruits
perhaps
almost
berrylike
fairly
sweet
but
some
nice
hop
character
as
well
lots
more
caramel
malt
on
the
palate
and
similar
hop
characteristics
a
bit
herbal
and
a
dash
of
pine
in
the
finish
perhaps
as
well
fruity
but
more
of
a
malt
show
than
anything
medium
full
feel
and
medium
low
carb
with
a
smooth
feel
easily
consumed
a
tasty
red
ale
glad
to
have
5
more
in
the
pack
overall
i
am
loving
this
one
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
then
a
sixer
if
available
in
my
area
this
would
move
up
to
my
go
to
amber
with
the
exception
of
freshly
bottled
jai
alai
i
believe
this
is
one
of
cigar
citys
best
every
day
beers
to
date
and
it
gives
fresh
jai
alai
a
neck
and
neck
run
for
its
money
highly
recomended
o
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
red
that
is
very
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
cigar
city
that
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
from
time
to
time
overall
this
brew
is
a
winner
and
so
is
cigar
city
this
is
up
there
with
nugget
nectar
in
my
book
wish
i
could
get
a
hold
of
this
on
a
regular
basis
m
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
sweet
breadiness
and
a
bit
astringent
overall
a
very
solid
amber
that
drinks
like
apa
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
something
about
the
taste
is
off
ive
had
this
many
times
a
bunch
of
different
batches
and
its
always
the
same
pretty
disappointing
ill
never
seek
this
out
again
o
a
very
complete
effort
complex
and
enjoyable
as
a
session
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
hops
this
will
become
a
staple
for
me
another
great
effort
by
the
folks
at
ccb
you
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
but
is
relatively
strong
not
a
great
beer
but
a
very
good
amber
o
this
beer
is
as
good
as
i
remember
i
would
love
to
run
a
little
hop
through
it
but
a
unique
red
hoppy
ale
beats
nugget
nectar
any
day
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
complex
brew
that
seems
to
be
a
dizzying
mix
of
a
red
amber
brown
and
ipa
bottomline
is
that
it
is
very
tasty
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
as
a
regular
offering
rock
solid
picked
up
this
beer
the
other
day
from
italian
market
in
st
petersburg
and
i
must
say
this
beer
has
such
a
great
hoppy
taste
it
has
a
very
complex
yet
not
bitter
finish
looking
forward
to
trying
more
beer
from
cigar
city
if
this
beer
is
any
indication
i
think
i
might
be
in
for
some
more
pleasant
surprises
from
my
local
tampa
brewery
i
am
thinking
about
heading
over
this
saturday
for
the
opening
of
their
hunahpus
imperial
stout
anyways
this
red
ale
is
fantastic
and
highly
recommended
o
very
enjoyable
beer
got
this
one
down
pretty
easily
would
gladly
drink
again
w
if
it
was
a
woman
itd
be
the
sexy
unassuming
librarian
who
comes
off
sweet
at
first
but
reveals
a
sensuous
and
unexpected
side
once
you
get
her
home
a
winner
no
wonder
this
went
from
pilot
batch
to
production
in
12ounce
bottles
so
quickly
i
see
why
its
so
popular
o
this
is
one
of
the
staples
of
cigar
citys
regular
lineup
a
musttry
for
people
who
like
red
ales
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
my
trusty
surly
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
hue
with
an
ample
head
of
about
three
fingers
width
tall
although
it
fades
in
a
hurry
the
nose
is
very
muted
this
is
almost
a
stone
cold
neutral
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
stellar
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
delicious
drinkable
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
it
has
a
minor
hop
profile
with
some
very
pronounced
malts
in
the
background
theres
also
a
very
minor
citrus
tone
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
also
stellar
smooth
as
hell
with
only
a
minor
bitter
finish
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
could
drink
this
regularly
with
no
problem
o
i
was
surprised
by
how
hoppy
this
beer
was
i
like
hoppy
beers
but
i
actually
found
this
a
little
astringent
i
can
see
how
this
could
become
a
favorite
if
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
all
the
time
for
those
who
cant
get
this
id
compare
it
to
a
really
hoppy
version
of
red
chair
nwpa
from
deschutes
definitely
worth
trying
and
one
i
would
gladly
drink
again
o
my
favorite
amber
and
when
fresh
like
this
one
very
hard
to
find
a
better
amber
ale
out
there
o
tastes
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
red
ale
but
pretty
decent
o
b
on
the
old
grading
scale
might
have
been
higher
without
some
of
the
flaws
in
appearance
and
smell
those
yeast
particles
really
were
offputting
to
me
i
guess
d
drinkability
definitely
an
above
average
amber
ale
and
somewhat
unique
in
this
arena
the
hop
bill
certainly
solidifies
this
overall
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
red
ales
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
quite
a
bit
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
in
the
category
picked
it
up
last
one
for
10
for
a
6pack
at
wards
happy
to
see
it
there
ive
had
it
on
tap
before
and
it
oi
like
this
one
id
buy
it
again
without
hesitation
o
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
amber
style
the
hoppy
ipa
in
there
seems
to
clash
with
the
red
a
bit
but
makes
for
an
interesting
blend
of
flavoring
certainly
worth
a
taste
or
a
few
probably
pretty
polarizing
amazing
for
the
hop
heads
but
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
for
the
style
police
this
guy
reminded
me
of
the
big
hoppy
monster
on
steroids
this
is
the
amber
ale
that
haunts
the
dreams
of
a
hop
head
and
is
seriously
worthy
of
some
recognition
awesome
beer
especially
this
fresh
m
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
o
overall
this
is
a
great
and
tasty
red
ale
it
isnt
a
classical
red
ale
but
it
is
a
great
american
take
on
one
id
definitely
recommend
anyone
to
try
this
beer
very
solid
beer
got
better
as
it
warmed
just
a
little
one
of
the
best
straightup
reds
ive
had
this
brew
has
a
fantastic
layering
depth
thats
lacking
in
the
majority
of
the
style
excellent
beer
overall
the
ipa
feel
of
this
brew
was
great
loved
the
hop
citrus
aroma
and
taste
cannot
wait
for
this
two
come
in
six
packs
cheers
o
this
makes
a
very
good
hoppy
autumn
beer
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
it
when
it
was
summer
especially
a
fl
summer
but
it
is
great
when
it
is
rainy
and
40
degrees
outside
and
i
am
not
ready
for
a
ris
worth
seeking
out
recommended
pours
a
nice
brownish
red
color
that
lets
in
only
a
bit
of
light
the
lacing
clings
in
off
white
patches
along
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
very
nice
hoppiness
to
it
inviting
bouquet
of
pine
and
sweet
malt
entices
the
taste
is
clean
and
hoppy
up
front
and
offers
some
sweetness
in
the
back
clean
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
suiting
for
the
style
overall
another
bomb
ass
brew
from
ccb
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
o
i
like
hoppy
amber
ales
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
would
definitely
get
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
cherried
wood
in
color
medium
in
body
with
an
off
white
lacing
around
my
snifter
it
smells
of
light
and
piny
hops
some
cherry
and
clean
malts
i
definitely
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
hoppy
its
simple
yet
really
nice
the
flavor
too
is
pretty
simple
but
overly
effect
it
features
flavors
of
slightly
sweet
malts
and
really
clean
and
not
overly
sticky
bitter
hops
its
just
really
approachable
and
easy
to
drink
for
an
amber
its
pretty
stellar
never
would
i
have
imagined
this
beer
to
be
so
hoppy
yet
again
another
great
beer
from
cigar
city
o
this
is
what
i
was
hoping
for
with
cigar
city
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
a
fantastic
beer
for
sure
hey
uncle
mark
when
you
drive
the
caddy
back
from
florida
in
the
spring
load
some
of
this
in
the
trunk
for
me
o
my
second
cc
beer
while
the
nose
was
tough
to
pick
up
everything
else
was
great
very
good
and
a
memorable
red
ale
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
overall
i
love
a
good
red
ale
and
this
beer
is
exactly
that
this
beer
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
i
just
polished
off
this
750ml
by
myself
and
i
would
not
mind
having
a
bit
more
overall
very
good
complex
and
interesting
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
o
another
solid
offering
from
ccb
this
is
a
good
change
of
pace
and
an
example
of
subtle
characteristics
making
a
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
amber
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
but
quite
flavorful
and
well
worth
trying
my
first
beer
from
florida
and
its
a
good
one
d
another
solid
offering
from
ccb
a
nice
take
on
the
style
love
the
hop
chaos
poured
a
dark
amberred
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
slight
soapy
haze
lovely
nose
of
sweet
amber
malt
and
dank
piney
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
nicely
lots
of
pungent
pine
and
grapefruit
hops
backed
up
by
the
sweet
amber
malt
backbone
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
and
crisp
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
amber
that
can
stack
up
to
the
big
boys
n
n
zoe
easily
so
glad
we
can
get
it
here
in
georgia
now
overall
im
both
disappointed
that
it
took
me
moving
across
the
country
to
have
beer
like
this
originate
from
tampa
but
delighted
to
get
my
hands
on
it
will
certainly
be
looking
forward
to
more
o
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
truly
one
of
ccbs
most
awesome
style
examples
of
how
far
they
can
take
it
i
think
its
more
of
an
imperial
red
but
im
not
complaining
im
going
to
be
getting
this
on
growler
a
lot
more
frequently
overall
this
was
a
pleasantly
surprising
beer
the
taste
is
excellent
though
it
has
a
little
alcohol
that
comes
through
but
the
taste
is
complex
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
cigar
city
beers
i
have
tried
o
a
good
beer
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
based
on
the
reviews
o
this
was
the
second
beer
of
the
night
while
at
ccb
and
they
kept
delivering
highly
recommended
o
solid
ccb
offering
here
its
a
big
malty
ale
nice
bite
all
around
and
a
pretty
easy
drinker
this
is
one
to
try
no
disappointment
here
will
be
getting
more
beer
is
thick
seriously
thick
heavy
on
the
malt
in
the
front
middle
and
back
this
is
a
malt
bomb
tastes
pretty
good
though
just
too
heavy
for
me
especially
for
such
a
big
bottle
it
was
good
and
id
have
it
on
draft
again
but
not
again
in
the
bottle
overall
its
a
solid
american
amber
ale
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
i
was
really
anxious
to
see
what
ccb
would
do
with
the
style
they
did
not
fail
to
impress
here
o
cigar
citys
tocobaga
red
ale
is
one
of
the
top
two
or
three
ambers
ive
consumed
its
got
everything
i
look
for
within
the
styles
limitations
plus
an
agressive
hop
profile
that
demands
respect
have
i
had
better
possibly
but
this
is
certainly
no
slouch
and
one
which
you
should
actively
be
iso
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
jefe73
for
this
one
signed
by
the
brewer
and
label
artists

of

served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
caramel
hop
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
caramel
hop
bitter
hop
and
subtle
citrus
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
good
really
glad
ccb
started
to
bottle
this
one
as
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
quite
awhile
it
did
not
disappoint
the
amber
flavor
profile
on
this
one
was
definitely
present
and
quite
enjoyable
the
malt
backbone
on
this
one
was
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
the
citrus
aspect
on
this
one
just
took
it
to
another
level
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
o
youd
have
to
have
a
magnifying
glass
to
detect
any
sort
of
cigar
city
taste
profile
on
this
one
but
its
still
fantastic
nonetheless
overall
an
interesting
and
unique
brew
fun
to
drink
i
am
glad
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
to
heavy
very
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
also
just
different
enough
to
be
interesting
num
num
overall
pretty
solid
iam
not
that
amazed
by
it
but
it
is
just
a
good
solid
well
done
amber
ale
overall
excellent
beer
overall
not
your
typical
american
amberred
ale
since
it
is
so
hoppy
but
the
category
isnt
too
precisely
defined
in
the
first
place
i
would
rank
this
among
the
best
cigar
city
beers
that
ive
had
highly
recommended
the
flavor
falls
back
a
bit
from
there
as
the
hop
flavor
isnt
as
prevalent
as
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
however
there
are
certainly
still
plenty
of
hops
nice
brown
sugar
and
caramel
sweetness
plus
backing
malt
medium
body
that
is
fairly
chewy
and
has
a
bitter
finish
that
is
slightly
dry
good
carbonation
really
really
solid
effort
all
around
well
worth
the
wait
this
is
an
excellent
amber
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
lately
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
hops
with
that
distinctive
ccb
woody
character
good
stuff
overall
yeah
great
so
so
so
much
flavor
packed
into
an
average
abv
ipa
this
is
crazy
what
a
delicious
brew
from
cigar
city
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
amazing
citrusy
and
kind
of
like
a
cotton
candy
smell
mixed
together
the
taste
was
excellent
a
malty
ipa
with
a
bunch
of
flavors
but
the
caramel
flavor
is
very
prominent
the
mouthfeel
again
is
great
overall
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
tried
as
of
late
easy
drinker
to
m
nice
and
soft
with
a
little
abrasive
carbonation
on
the
back
end
pours
a
deep
garnet
with
nice
clarity
and
a
sexy
frothy
khaki
head
with
great
retention
and
nice
lacing
nose
has
slightly
roasted
caramel
malts
nice
floral
hops
along
with
some
citrus
pith
and
some
grassy
hay
nice
full
mouthfeel
though
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
refreshing
and
a
nice
food
beer
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
though
i
deducted
points
for
a
slight
aspirin
astringency
very
nicely
done
beer
and
my
favorite
so
far
from
ccb
though
i
am
still
sitting
on
my
bigger
bottles
from
them
pours
a
hazy
redtinted
dark
orange
with
two
fingers
of
dense
cream
colored
foam
settles
very
slowly
to
a
thin
cap
sheet
of
delicate
lace
left
down
the
glass
smell
caramel
and
toasted
grain
base
with
a
dose
of
pineapple
citrus
rind
and
a
soft
note
of
tropical
fruit
along
as
well
taste
caramel
mildly
toasty
sugared
tropical
fruit
blam
of
white
grapefruit
earthiness
and
a
note
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
exceptionally
creamy
feel
liked
this
on
tap
last
year
love
it
in
the
bottle
now
6
packs
please
and
whoa
is
this
a
bottling
stamp
from
ccb
may
15
11
stamped
in
white
on
the
side
of
the
label
nearly
full
in
body
this
brew
has
good
carbonation
tangy
upfront
with
a
fairly
quick
fade
a
citrusy
hop
note
lingers
longest
even
surpassing
the
malt
some
warming
occurs
late
another
good
beer
from
ccb
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
if
fairly
unremarkable
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
stellar
this
is
an
absolutely
phenomenal
brew
and
im
looking
forward
to
the
bottles
they
made
yesterday
so
i
can
bring
this
bad
boy
home
and
drink
it
every
night
had
agin
on
bottle
and
was
very
interesting
citrus
hoppy
piney
with
malt
balance
so
drinkable
big
head
obecomes
less
complex
but
still
stays
great
i
want
them
to
bottle
this
people
will
love
this
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
i
find
it
to
be
much
better
that
nugget
nectar
o
very
drinkable
the
hops
and
malt
bill
is
balanced
nicely
a
little
too
much
alcohol
comes
through
which
is
this
brews
only
downfall
i
wish
they
wouldve
filled
me
a
growler
of
this
skal
d
nice
red
and
intriguing
with
the
fresh
hops
enough
intrigue
to
get
me
to
return
to
this
one
this
is
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
definitely
one
of
the
best
redsambers
ive
had
it
drinks
like
a
hoppy
pale
ale
amber
coppery
color
pours
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
quickly
quite
bitter
and
hoppy
in
the
mouth
but
its
very
smooth
about
it
light
malt
and
resin
flavors
that
are
very
pleasant
there
is
a
nice
tartness
and
a
bit
of
dryness
on
the
finish
just
an
outstanding
beer
very
similar
to
terrapins
big
hoppy
monster
which
you
should
try
if
you
like
tocobaga
i
cant
wait
for
them
to
start
bottling
it
i
heard
the
newest
batch
was
going
to
be
bottled
in
750ml
sizes
not
sure
if
its
been
done
yet
or
not
only
problem
was
the
gas
from
the
growler
filled
me
up
quick
so
i
only
had
2
glasses
everyone
else
finished
it
off
if
you
can
get
it
get
it
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
brewery
tocobaga
has
a
nice
1inch
head
that
slowly
dissipates
down
to
leave
a
nice
sticky
ring
atop
its
orangeamber
body
smells
of
sweet
malt
lemon
and
citrusy
hops
taste
is
just
as
inviting
a
smell
slight
sweetness
with
a
wide
hop
variety
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
my
all
time
favorite
red
appeals
more
to
the
hop
head
drinkability
is
quite
remarkable
for
a
7
hopforward
beer
drinks
like
an
english
pale
ale
and
thats
scary
d
this
is
really
good
its
up
there
with
fresh
nugget
nectar
i
had
multiple
pours
at
the
taproom
and
bought
a
few
growlers
it
was
probably
for
the
best
that
the
keg
blew
as
it
prevented
me
from
buying
even
more
d
very
nice
the
malt
and
hops
are
perfectly
balanced
especially
in
the
aroma
where
the
fruity
notes
perfectly
compliment
the
sweetness
of
the
toffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
hop
characteristics
are
sharper
and
push
back
more
against
the
malt
but
still
leave
the
beer
balanced
and
drinkable
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
the
boys
down
in
tampa
and
it
rivals
true
west
coast
red
ales
such
as
those
from
green
flash
and
stone
draft
pours
a
clear
copper
red
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
hoppy
citric
aroma
on
the
nose
along
with
sweet
malt
and
some
woodiness
nice
lace
left
on
the
glass
as
it
settles
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carb
the
flavor
starts
off
with
some
sweetness
followed
by
flavors
of
citrus
hops
and
the
earthywoody
notes
in
the
nose
for
a
red
ale
this
is
nicely
balanced
without
being
too
maltyl
very
easy
drinking
as
well
ends
with
a
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
overall
goes
down
easy
for
the
abv
wish
there
was
a
little
more
on
the
nose
but
definitely
an
awesome
beer
for
the
style
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
hopped
up
red
ale
well
done
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
ccb
beers
they
need
to
bottle
this
one
highly
recommend
overall
an
excellent
beer
on
all
accounts
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
m
just
like
a
big
ipa
this
brew
is
a
weighty
mediumbodied
brew
wellcarbonated
and
smooth
yet
substantial
drinkability
im
still
waiting
for
cc
to
miss
on
a
beer
seems
like
they
are
perfect
d
i
really
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
was
until
i
came
on
here
to
review
it
though
i
sort
of
figured
it
was
some
sort
of
red
ale
pretty
nice
actually
over
all
another
great
offering
from
ccb
d
good
really
like
this
one
look
forward
to
its
cousin
the
lager
version
overall
i
really
enjoy
copperhook
and
recommend
it
if
you
like
session
ales
copperred
ales
or
if
your
palate
runs
more
towards
malt
than
hops
d
rather
mediocre
when
it
comes
to
ambers
stays
pretty
true
to
style
guidelines
but
as
previously
stated
there
are
many
superior
examples
of
this
style
available
to
me
than
the
copper
hook
thin
but
clean
and
refreshing
stubby
bottle
helps
a
vigorous
pour
that
makes
the
head
look
good
no
accident
i
suspect
hops
are
very
ekg
if
this
were
1
abv
itd
line
up
as
a
killer
best
bitter
as
it
is
too
light
in
both
body
and
color
for
the
strength
though
still
very
moreish
o
this
beer
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
someone
would
order
if
the
bar
doesnt
have
budweiser
and
they
wanted
a
cheap
american
brew
its
a
fuller
better
balanced
version
of
a
macrobrew
but
doesnt
seem
to
have
all
the
craftsmanship
of
the
typical
microbrew
i
didnt
like
the
bread
yeast
flavor
and
the
sweetness
tasted
like
a
cheap
logger
the
nuttiness
was
a
good
attempt
but
not
quite
enough
overall
this
beer
is
okay
nothing
special
it
has
no
flaws
other
than
not
being
copper
it
would
be
good
for
a
session
but
not
very
interesting
as
a
stand
alone
not
especially
pleasant
even
when
compared
with
other
ambers
not
a
fan
sickly
sweet
finish
kills
a
crisp
buttery
start
overall
this
couldve
been
an
alright
and
simple
beer
had
it
not
been
for
the
metallicrust
flavors
which
made
it
taste
like
old
pennies
as
it
is
right
now
i
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
this
unless
you
like
your
mouth
tasting
like
old
rusty
copper
pennies
overall
wow
this
beer
isnt
good
i
know
redhook
isnt
exactly
known
for
outstanding
beers
but
even
by
their
standards
this
isnt
good
it
tastes
more
like
a
poorly
done
amber
lager
than
an
amber
ale
an
okay
beer
nothing
special
from
the
12
oz
bottle
with
the
bottled
on
date
of
jun
25
12
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
rich
grain
with
a
very
dark
roast
tastes
of
dark
roasted
malt
but
a
little
bland
lightmedium
bodied
beer
has
good
carbonation
and
goes
down
real
easy
overall
an
above
average
beer
o
a
good
drinkable
copperamber
ale
few
faults
but
doesnt
excel
in
anything
either
really
the
basic
one
dimensional
flavors
not
unpleasant
but
certainly
unexciting
and
just
a
bit
boring
poors
a
light
amber
with
not
much
head
and
poor
retention
medium
roast
caramel
fruity
taste
follows
with
medium
caramel
and
fruit
slightly
thin
with
a
nondistinct
bitterness
overall
a
uneventful
beer
but
not
entirely
bad
seems
to
be
bridging
the
gap
between
big
brews
and
true
craft
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
apple
juice
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
slight
fruits
and
some
slight
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
all
around
but
easy
enough
to
drink
o
decent
for
the
style
but
wasnt
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
for
this
beer
has
a
really
pleasing
malt
backbone
with
a
slightly
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
not
unbalanced
just
really
drinkable
a
surprisingly
successful
brew
from
redhook
this
is
a
rather
disappointing
beer
its
one
dimensional
and
simplistic
it
doesnt
have
many
of
the
pronounced
characteristics
that
make
ambers
such
a
great
style
its
drinkable
and
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
but
this
just
isnt
what
im
looking
for
in
this
style
redhook
dishes
out
a
decent
effort
in
copperhook
its
nothing
crazy
though
thats
not
to
say
it
wont
put
me
in
a
good
mood
before
bedtime
owill
totally
hit
this
agian
rjt
overall
an
average
amber
to
say
the
least
weak
in
nearly
every
conceivable
way
its
drinkable
and
thats
about
all
it
has
going
in
its
favor
although
a
little
higher
in
alcohol
content
5
78
abv
than
your
average
sessionable
beer
this
an
easy
drinking
brew
not
complex
or
overwhelming
in
an
category
but
id
prefer
something
more
tasty
not
a
bad
brew
to
end
a
night
on
though
a
rather
standard
amber
i
dont
really
have
much
negative
to
say
about
this
beer
but
i
dont
have
much
praise
either
its
a
very
minimalistic
take
on
the
american
amberred
ale
style
this
is
lacking
hops
and
a
good
malt
profile
a
good
beer
for
drinking
but
not
much
for
thinking
about
id
drink
another
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
i
think
ive
used
the
word
bland
a
few
times
already
lets
talk
positives
there
are
no
off
flavors
theres
maybe
30
ibu
of
bitterness
not
much
in
discernable
hopping
a
mild
consistency
o
overall
this
is
an
average
craft
amber
ale
its
a
decent
everyday
drinking
beer
but
not
a
beer
id
go
specifically
out
of
my
way
for
drinkability
this
one
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
props
to
mike
my
cousininlaw
who
gave
me
this
at
the
annual
christmas
party
i
took
down
the
tree
today
and
put
away
the
seasonal
stuff
i
figured
it
was
a
good
moment
to
sit
and
enjoy
this
beer
thanks
mike
mouthfeel
is
crisp
drinkability
is
low
because
you
could
have
a
couple
but
why
would
you
want
to
o
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
per
se
other
than
the
non
existent
head
its
just
hard
to
get
excited
for
this
style
would
be
a
decent
tailgaiting
beer
or
something
a
good
entry
level
beer
o
not
great
but
much
better
than
the
other
two
redhooks
ive
reviewed
smell
and
taste
way
too
light
for
me
but
not
bad
by
any
means
o
copperhook
is
pretty
plain
for
the
most
part
it
would
go
well
with
a
juicy
burger
cheers
very
average
beer
dr
drinkable
but
not
as
much
as
some
of
the
brewerys
other
offerings
id
try
it
on
draught
o
im
not
sure
if
the
journey
from
wa
to
mi
was
bad
for
this
beer
but
i
couldnt
help
but
feel
that
this
beer
was
a
bit
flat
tasting
perhaps
i
expected
to
much
from
this
but
it
just
average
at
best
o
i
dont
know
what
redhook
is
trying
to
pull
here
this
beer
just
straight
up
tastes
like
a
pilsner
to
me
well
its
under
the
style
of
a
red
ale
so
i
guess
thats
how
ill
review
it
to
me
this
is
a
weak
red
ale
with
not
enough
malts
to
balance
not
to
style
at
all
in
fact
i
believe
fat
tire
is
more
to
style
then
this
anyway
as
a
kick
back
and
just
drink
brew
its
alright
sure
but
i
dont
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
to
get
into
reds
and
i
certainly
wont
be
buying
this
again
overall
not
liking
this
for
a
red
ale
seems
out
of
category
first
off
i
hate
the
new
bottles
sorry
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
low
white
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
the
head
settles
out
quickly
and
just
about
disappears
low
aroma
of
honey
and
lemon
light
flavor
of
doughey
malt
some
biscuit
and
honey
sweetness
notes
of
corn
some
floral
hops
and
a
peppery
spice
finish
mild
bitterness
even
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
lacking
in
complexity
im
not
sad
to
see
it
in
my
fridge
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
above
average
and
definately
worth
a
try
its
cheap
and
easy
just
like
me
so
give
it
a
shot
o
overall
i
liked
this
as
a
backyard
bbq
ale
but
not
loved
because
it
was
a
bit
straightforward
while
i
may
not
buy
this
in
vast
quantities
if
i
wanted
to
get
a
couple
nods
from
guys
who
like
northweird
breweries
and
i
saw
this
was
on
sale
its
an
easy
decision
of
yes
not
regrettable
by
any
means
but
not
something
that
would
make
my
heart
skip
a
beat
cheers
cheers
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
but
well
drinkable
and
goes
down
with
a
pretty
good
finish
i
tried
a
few
bottles
of
this
at
varying
temperatures
it
was
hard
to
find
the
perfect
temp
but
all
in
all
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
this
is
the
first
i
have
had
from
the
brewery
and
its
worth
trying
some
other
types
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
good
for
a
bad
weather
day
mf
mouthcoating
yet
not
entirely
oily
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
a
perfect
transition
from
winter
darks
to
summer
lagers
refreshing
and
light
but
not
much
taste
to
be
had
astonishingly
copper
colored
with
thin
white
head
good
carbonation
but
a
bit
cloudy
citrus
hops
in
the
aroma
with
some
caramel
but
not
much
going
on
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
and
sweet
grainy
slightly
bitter
and
with
an
odd
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
a
bit
heavy
overall
im
not
impressed
with
this
one
compared
to
redhooks
other
beers
its
very
generic
and
the
off
flavors
dissapoint
this
was
an
average
amber
ale
the
color
looked
decent
with
a
fizzy
white
head
not
too
much
lacing
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
decent
malt
aromas
but
nothing
too
special
the
taste
was
on
the
sweeter
side
and
with
a
subtle
bitterness
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
light
side
overall
its
an
average
amber
ale
at
best
the
body
was
a
bit
thinner
than
i
like
in
this
style
drinkability
was
ok
i
could
see
having
a
few
at
a
cookout
where
beer
isnt
the
focus
overall
a
good
solid
middle
of
the
road
brew
thatll
make
a
good
training
wheel
beer
final
notes
this
is
a
beer
id
have
when
i
just
want
to
put
some
beer
away
its
sessionable
and
unoffensive
but
not
really
memorable
either
not
good
but
not
bad
either
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
a
light
sourish
citrus
with
hints
of
even
lighter
earthy
grains
and
summer
hops
that
transfer
lightly
into
a
very
light
dry
citrus
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
actually
quite
drinkable
but
no
really
outstanding
qualities
unlike
some
of
the
other
beers
that
redhook
ales
make
d
still
enjoyable
whether
or
not
this
recipe
has
been
tweaked
i
cant
tell
but
it
still
would
serve
as
a
great
gateway
craft
brew
for
someone
looking
to
expand
their
tastes
might
get
lost
in
the
myriad
of
spring
releases
for
most
however
o
a
merely
ok
beer
for
me
its
not
bad
but
there
wasnt
anything
memorable
about
it
that
would
inspire
me
to
buy
it
instead
of
any
of
the
many
beers
that
are
similar
i
walked
away
thinking
it
was
not
altogether
unlike
a
further
toned
down
fat
tire
overall
not
much
to
trumpet
about
here
but
not
much
to
complain
about
either
i
guess
i
just
intuitively
expect
more
from
a
seattle
brewery
o
not
really
my
favorite
and
it
doesnt
have
much
that
i
look
for
in
an
amber
d
blame
other
breweries
cause
i
have
a
much
heightened
expectation
for
this
style
this
guy
could
use
some
serious
hop
additionsdryhopping
overall
a
really
enjoyable
session
beer
enough
flavor
to
go
around
not
the
best
amber
on
the
market
but
not
bad
o
the
most
average
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
quaffable
got
this
one
on
sale
i
would
pass

more

overall
i
give
copper

average
marks
during
a
visit
to
portsmouth
we
took
the
opportunity
to
visit
redhook
brewery
tried
the
copper
hook
copper
ale
the
color
was
a
light
copper
with
nice
carbonation
that
gave
way
to
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
was
a
very
faint
if
any
the
taste
was
good
but
nothing
to
make
me
write
a
description
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
i
certainly
could
do
a
session
with
this
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
of
sweet
malts
with
various
grains
and
slight
citrusy
notes
pretty
basic
the
taste
had
more
citrus
character
with
very
subtle
hops
alongside
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
underlying
booze
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
sweet
citrusy
and
mild
crisp
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
but
was
really
basic
all
around
definitely
a
session
beer
d
good
would
be
willing
to
purchase
if
other
standouts
not
available
average
on
all
accounts
malty
sweet
caramel
light
on
the
hops
tastes
watered
down
and
diluted
very
similar
to
the
esb
in
my
opinion
with
most
of
these
characteristics
dvery
drinkable
i
wanted
more
after
i
had
finished
the
sample
pack
ones
overall
an
average
beer
though
this
beer
is
not
horrible
but
its
not
good
either
if
you
see
it
on
sale
it
is
worth
getting
but
dont
expect
much
pleasantly
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
d
nothing
really
stood
out
about
this
beer
to
me
just
a
lot
of
malts
easy
to
drink
but
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
wouldnt
seek
out
again
an
adequate
amber
ale
nothing
to
make
you
say
hey
slightly
hoppy
ale
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
copperhook
with
the
exception
of
the
oddly
metallic
scentflavor
that
persists
through
out
the
session
average
in
all
aspects

i
have

to

to
the
well

and
informative
reviews
that
precede
mine
however
id
like
to
make
an
observation
i
didnt
see
or
missed
in
the
other
reviews
copperhook
had
no
aftertaste
at
all
as
soon
as
i
swallowed
a
sip
there
was
absolutely
no
finish
left
behind
it
was
as
if
id
never
taken
a
drink
at
all
ive
never
experienced
anything
like
that
before
i
hadnt
eaten
anything
or
drank
anything
else
and
i
dont
smoke
so
nothing
couldve
been
present
to
mask
a
finish
it
was
the
strangest
beer
drinking
experience
ive
ever
had
12

with
a
bottled
on
date
of
011608
on
the
front
label
dull
fairly
clear
light
almond
amber
amber
minor
lace
and
scattered
decent
looking
lacing
just
a
smidgen
of
malty
aroma
middle
of
the
road
fairly
flavorless
ale
certainly
nothing
exciting
going
on
here
better
then
bmc
type
offerings
but
not
by
much
md
mouthfeel
is
relatively
full
for
a
lighter
bodied
brew
but
still
rather
satisfying
the
carbonation
is
mostly
light
and
stays
pretty
consistent
throughout
the
glass
the
smoothness
and
nice
complexity
make
this
generally
enjoyable
with
good
drinkability
tastes
like
a
great
apa
that
somebody
wanted
to
tweak
with
wit
spices
i
like
it
because
its
a
fun
experiment
and
different
flavor
but
they
didnt
overload
it
so
much
with
those
flavors
that
you
cant
taste
the
pale
ale
base
its
definitely
a
great
summer
beach
beer
but
id
like
to
see
the
alcohol
cut
by
at
least
1
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
verdict
smooth
and
drinkable
but
not
much
else
doesnt
feel
like
a
true
pale
ale

shiny
copper

although
really
light
colored
looks
nice
with
a
decent
white

touch
metallic
and

taste
is
fresh

tart

sort
of
sharp
crisp

lightly
sourish

not
in
a
spoiled
way

a

of

liked
the

for

this
one
is
good
red
hook
falls
victim
in
this
instance
of
making
a
seasonal
brew
taste
like
some
of
their
standard
line
stuff
look
to
long
trail
and
saranac
as
being
the
main
offenders
here
but
red
hook
doesnt
make
a
strong
case
against
that
with
copperhook
one
of
the
best
ambers
ive
had
color
is
a
beautiful
clear
reddishamber
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
persists
somewhat
aroma
is
not
strong
but
it
is
invitingly
malty
and
spicy
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
strong
overtones
of
spice
mostly
cinnamon
and
cloves
smooth
and
refreshing
lively
and
zingy
this
is
a
beer
for
sipping
and
savoring

beer

a
12oz
mug
it

appropriate

with

a

where
are
the

hardly
any

pretty
standard

toasty

grainy
with
a

a

really
sub

in
my

thats
to
bad
it

it
just
seems
thrown
together

a

bit
simple
well
if
there
is
an
example
of
a
completely
average
beer
this
is
that
example
doesnt
taste
bad
or
anything
in
fact
this
has
very
mild
taste
and
appearance
similar
to
good
beer
in
the
same
way
a
porsche
914
resembles
a
real
porsche
sure
it
is
a
porsche
but
it
is
a
lot
closer
to
a
volkswagen
nothing
remarkable
here
try
it
once
and
then
buy
the
sam
adams
boston
lager
instead
this
beer
poured
a
beautiful
goldishbrown
with
about
an
inch
head
and
nice
lacing
its
nose
wasnt
very
strong
a
bit
of
malt
and
grain
very
faint
though
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
taste
at
all
although
the
beer
was
refreshing
i
expected
more
depth
based
on
its
color
a
very
mild
flavor
with
a
majority
of
grain
flavor
also
a
citrus
note
hidden
in
the
background
it
had
mild
carbonation
which
made
for
a
very
smooth
drink
highly
drinkable
i
prefer
a
more
complex
spring
ale
but
others
will
love
this
mild
flavor
edit
ive
had
this
a
few
more
times
and
while
still
far
from
my
favorite
redhook
i
have
realized
its
one
of
the
smoothest
and
cleanest
beers
around
pours
an
orangey
amber
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
pretty
well
all
the
way
down
it
has
an
aroma
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
some
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
end
it
tasted
pretty
good
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
together
for
a
decent
pale
ale
it
starts
off
sweet
and
malty
but
with
a
kick
of
citrusy
hops
that
finish
off
the
flavor
for
a
decent
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
very
crisp
and
is
pretty
drinkable
good
beer
follows
style
i
would
do
a
session
with
this
beer
i
will
drink
again
good
apa
for
anytime
of
the
year
pours
a
mildly
colored
dark
orange
into
a
pint
glass
decent
amount
of
head
hop
aroma
comes
to
the
forefront
on
the
first
sniff
very
citrusy
in
general
very
well
balanced
hides
the
alcohol
while
also
not
overblowing
with
hop
character
good
malt
profile
as
well
smooth
and
easy
to
quaff
in
spite
of
its
slightly
higher
alcohol
than
most
apas
this
is
a
sessioner
for
sure
overall
nothing
incredible
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
granted
im
drinking
this
spring
ale
in
february
in
southern
freaking
wisconsin
maybe
spring
or
early
summer
would
better
suit
this
brew
d
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
on
a
warm
day
certainly
better
than
the
average
macro
the
unpleasant
plywood
taste
would
keep
me
from
buying
more
however
this
brew
could
use
a
big
shot
in
the
arm
of
hops
malts
body
etc
it
would
be
pretty
good
for
a
macro
drinker
in
the
depths
of
winter
but
for
me
a
lawnmower
beer
albeit
a
pretty
good
one
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
hoppy
nose
flavor
is
bland
just
weak
hops
slight
metallic
aftertaste
1
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
dnot
all
that
great
but
hey
at
a
party
with
nothin
but
this
and
bmc
in
the
cooler
you
know
where
im
reachin
d
great
nothing
is
extra
special
about
this
brew
but
it
is
somewhat
unique
in
that
it
is
very
biscuity
and
loaded
with
saltine
cracker
flavors
a
bit
too
offkilter
to
session
i
wont
be
coming
back
pours
and
orangeamber
color
with
little
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
not
much
lacing
on
glass
no
real
distinguishing
characteristic
that
would
make
me
seek
it
out
a
second
time
but
still
a
refreshing
enjoyable
beer
little
bitterness
and
thin
mouthfeel
would
not
be
my
first
choice
to
grab
if
im
choosing
a
pale
ale
overall
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
to
say
theres
nothing
bad
about
the
beer
but
its
fairly
lacking
in
flavor
might
be
good
on
a
hot
day
i
suppose
d
yuck
nothing
about
this
beer
fits
the
style
or
even
tastes
good
im
going
to
pour
the
rest
out
pours
a
clear
almost
peachyorange
amber
hue
with
a
light
dusting
of
white
head
of
the
liquid
mild
aroma
thats
pretty
lacking
in
hops
instead
theres
a
doughy
malt
quality
in
its
place
along
with
some
grains
and
light
fruits
and
a
distracting
cleanserlike
note
thats
minor
but
a
touch
offputting
on
the
palate
mild
pale
grains
hit
first
along
with
a
bit
of
juicy
sweetness
toward
the
midpalate
slightly
sour
toward
the
end
with
a
flash
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
finish
that
goes
sweet
again
overall
this
is
certainly
an
ok
beer
easy
to
drink
and
hard
to
dislike
theres
little
here
thats
special
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
strong
flavors
or
panache
which
i
would
ideally
look
for
in
an
apa
drinking
this
one
again
copperhook
spring
ale
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
there
are
enough
ingredients
present
and
theyre
arranged
in
a
skilled
enough
manner
to
make
me
glad
that
i
took
a
chance
on
another
redhook
beer
if
i
was
the
head
suit
at
the
brewery
id
make
this
a
yearround
release
rather
than
a
seasonal
great
balance
between
sweetness
of
caramel
malts
and
bitterness
of
hops
very
clean
and
drinkable
i
could
go
through
a
few
12oz
bron
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
22107
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
2
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
good
lace
very
light
in
aroma
a
bit
of
caramel
and
honey
with
a
hint
of
citrus
but
not
much
else
not
a
ton
of
flavor
here
either
very
light
and
quickly
fading
caramel
malts
followed
by
a
hop
bitterness
that
also
fades
quickly
this
beer
is
very
light
and
refreshing
a
great
summertime
beer
but
a
poor
apa
pours
an
orangey
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
no
real
aroma
to
speak
of
with
some
very
slight
sweet
grains
detectable
taste
is
very
bland
with
very
light
malts
and
hops
slightly
bitter
just
a
really
generic
apa
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
bland
drinkability
was
fine
very
generic
beer
pretty
disappointing
the
draft
version
was
a
little
tamer
than
the
bottled
version
but
thats
not
saying
much
where
once
there
was
a
little
hop
now
there
was
not
it
just
comes
off
as
a
smooth
amber
ale
to
me
call
it
a
gateway
beer
maybe
its
inoffensive
and
and
probably
allmalt
so
its
not
all
bad
worth
the
7
for
the
6pack
maybe
but
the
same
plus
a
buck
could
have
bought
me
something
id
have
liked
a
lot
better
and
so
it
goes
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
brew
i
could
see
this
being
mighty
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
iron
range
bar
and
grill
in
the
xcel
energy
center
before
a
wild
game
pours
a
bright
orangecopper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
little
head
retention
smell
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
dew
melons
taste
was
sweet
with
malt
ending
ina
nice
hop
bitterness
and
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
was
average
it
wasnt
watery
had
some
body
to
it
a
nice
mellow
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
impression
a
pleasant
beer
fairly
middle
of
the
road
in
may
respects
no
obvious
flaws
but
no
exciting
elements
either
a
solid
craft
brew
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
and
refreshing
for
spring
time
the
combination
of
the
hops
and
the
sweetness
was
not
my
favorite
but
it
was
not
overpowering
d
not
half
bad
but
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
alcohol
is
a
tad
high
to
be
a
true
session
beer
but
i
am
not
complaining
being
it
is
35f
in
the
first
week
of
april
here
in
boston
hops
are
a
bit
more
assertive
in
the
taste
although
metal
taints
the
taste
on
the
way
down
and
the
malts
are
stiill
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
round
and
allows
the
bitterness
to
at
least
be
a
factor
drinkable
but
not
worth
going
far
out
of
your
way
for
unless
you
live
where
i
do
i
certainly
dont
love
this
beer
but
im
glad
its
available
without
driving
the
15
miles
to
fuquay
or
the
27
to
fayetteville
i
paired
this
with
some
leftover
sausage
and
goat
cheese
lasagna
im
not
thrilled
with
the
pairing
but
i
didnt
have
much
of
a
selection
this
evening
however
i
am
taken
by
the
notion
that
lasagna
is
always
better
on
the
second
day
fancy
italian
restaurants
really
should
offer
yesterdays
lasagna
its
excellent
drinkability
its
lack
of
distinctiveness
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
take
down
and
quickly
but
this
beer
is
a
typical
redhook
offering
taste
that
doesnt
have
anything
especially
redeeming
or
unique
about
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
fizzy
on
the
palate
in
fact
the
highly
carbonated
beverage
only
hurts
itself
it
detracts
from
the
flavor
the
tongue
concentrates
more
on
the
carbonation
than
on
the
flavor
the
body
however
is
fuller
than
i
expected
it
is
somewhere
between
light
and
medium
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
one
could
in
fact
drink
this
all
night
but
why
i
can
assure
you
there
are
much
better
brews
out
there
i
wouldnt
buy
this
brew
again
unless
i
was
left
with
no
better
alternatives
drinkability
a
pretty
nondescript
ale
that
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
but
nothing
amazing
or
something
which
warrants
a
must
try
rerated

from
a
bottle
poured
a
deep
golden
color
maybe
an
orange

yes
i
repeated
myself
yeasty
aroma
the
yeastiness
carries
bit
of
orange
almost
a
corriander
tinge
interestingly
flavorful
not
bad
i
could
guzzle
a
few
mouth
much
like
it

pleasant

skip
this
one
if
youre
curious
not
recommended
served
a
crisp
light
orange
with
a
great
frothy
head
that
was
lasting
and
left
great
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
some
caramel
malts
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
was
dominated
by
earthy
rustic
hops
with
a
great
caramel
malt
backbone
right
behind
there
was
low
carbonation
and
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
alcohol
bite
this
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
for
spring
this
one
is
labeled
as
an
american
pale
ale
but
it
seems
more
similar
to
an
american
amberred
ale
under
either
category
the
amount
of
flavor
is
pretty
low
a
bland
overall
beer
skip
it
pours
a
very
clear
copper
with
a
light
whipped
egg
whites
head
and
medium
bubbling
pretty
standard
the
smell
had
some
dry
malts
and
a
little
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
very
simple
the
palate
was
a
little
watery
nut
you
could
taste
the
dry
crystal
malts
the
hops
lended
some
macro
bitterness
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
pretty
quenching
to
the
palate
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
bland
pretty
simple
and
easy
to
drink
but
this
stuff
cost
a
little
more
than
your
busch
light
d
a
decent
beer
if
you
dont
expect
it
to
be
a
citrusy
apa
completely
middleoftheroad
tastes
like
it
should
cost
less
than
it
actually
does
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
it
has
a
creamy
malt
aroma
with
a
light
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
creamy
with
some
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
with
loads
of
malt
flavor
medium
body
with
a
slight
creamy
thickness
average
ale
with
a
little
something
extra
pleaseent
enough
but
not
amazing
a
soft
and
delicate
beer
that
somehow
seems
perfect
for
spring
with
its
floral
hop
notes
and
pillowy
malt
base
frm
safeway
in
eureka
this
poured
a
very
clear
and
light
amber
color
that
left
a
small
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
nose
was
malts
and
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
and
clean
flavor
was
of
a
slight
sweet
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
finish
slight
bitter
and
dry
nothing
fancy
here
but
nothing
wrong
either
decent
brew
draught
i
wouldnt
call
the
color
copper
it
is
lighter
than
that
perhaps
even
a
touch
orange
it
is
crystal
clear
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
but
still
pleasing
slightly
sweet
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
a
biscuity
malt
taste
slightly
dry
finish
smooth
and
very
drinkable
this
one
grows
on
you
a
bit
a
decent
session
beer
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
drain
pour
but
lots
to
improve
on
mk
a
new
offering
to
the
central
ky
area
first
stab
at
the
copperhook
the
look
is
a
slightly
tawny
golden
copper
hue
with
the
same
head
retention
that
i
get
out
of
most
redhook
beers
slightly
average
the
aromas
area
mild
blend
of
barley
malts
and
american
hops
both
are
subdued
a
lightly
caramel
malt
flavor
is
balanced
with
lightly
spiced
citrus
and
pine
hops
the
hops
remain
light
enough
not
to
dominate
the
medium
malt
base
the
feel
is
a
thinnerthanprefered
grain
base
with
a
slight
metalic
feel
deep
into
the
finish
progressing
bitterness
into
the
aftertaste
but
never
deters
a
fine
beer
that
is
equal
on
all
fronts
just
light
in
all
a
good
one
for
the
barbq
on
the
hot
summer
padio
pours
a
dark
golden
color
just
slightly
darker
than
the
usual
american
lager
there
are
a
few
similarities
between
this
beer
and
sam
adams
lager
it
isnt
quite
a
smooth
probably
since
it
is
an
ale
but
has
some
similar
hop
flavor
i
got
this
in
the
bottle
at
wal
mart
in
auburn
al
and
it
is
quite
fresh
it
has
a
refreshing
smell
and
taste
and
they
balance
the
hops
well
with
the
malt
so
you
can
taste
them
both
and
enjoy
the
beer
it
is
a
decent
session
beer
but
slightly
bitter
which
may
slow
some
people
down
it
has
a
slight
sourness
but
overall
nice
flavor
and
a
very
light
ale
i
would
say
it
is
just
slightly
heavier
than
what
i
expect
of
a
lawnmower
ale
but
that
is
probably
right
since
it
is
a
spring
ale
great
job
red
hookeven
if
you
are
affiliated
with
ab
i
still
think
this
is
a
fine
craft
brew
clean
hoppy
taste
citrus
overtones
are
accented
by
cascade
bitters
not
overpowering
but
will
certainly
assert
themselves
mild
malt
profile
clean
mouthfeel
a
refreshing
beer
good
drinkability
suspect
it
would
pair
well
with
salmon
or
summer
fare
i
enjoyed
and
recommend
it
the
springtime
release
from
redhook
it
promises
to
be
clear
and
citrusy
it
is
a
nicelooking
beer
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
aroma
was
all
butter
it
did
have
a
muted
citrus
taste
with
a
little
tang
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
an
ok
session
beer
price
point
was
good
at
under
7
drank
2
and
they
went
down
easy
i
would
buy
this
again
not
a
bad
session
beer
i
see
rh
gets
grief
due
to
its
ab
connection
but
this
beer
is
clearly
not
the
enemy
especially
when
you
only
have
about
7
d
very
different
havent
had
anything
quite
like
it
this
is
a
terrible
example
of
an
apa
but
it
is
good
maybe
not
something
id
get
often
but
something
i
will
get
on
occasion
it
went
well
with
the
sushi
i
was
having
for
lunch
no
where
near
copper
in
color
but
works
as
a
springtime
referesher
try
it
not
a
bad
effort
from
the
hook
drinkability
ill
pass
on
this
one
not
a
pale
ale
and
not
even
a
good
wheat
brew
sinkability

good
thing
i
have
some
penicillin
left
over
from
that
bought
i
had
with
syphilis
a
few
months
bag
cause
im
gonna
need
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
well
balanced
flavor
i
could
drink
several
glasses
this
beer
in
a
session
a
very
nice
and
welcome
spring
ale
overall
impression
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
not
bad
for
a
spring
seasonal
though
the
beer
after
its
disemboguing
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
the
lace
formed
after
head
depletion
forms
a
tight
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
fresh
crisp
with
a
nice
malt
sweetness
start
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
fair
to
middling
grain
presence
and
the
top
light
finish
has
a
benign
acidity
with
the
hops
light
but
detectable
a
very
dry
somewhat
soapy
aftertaste
linger
long
drinkable
but
nothing
more
a
good
spring
beer
easy
drinking
as
promised
red
hoptober
is
a
well
hoped
red
ale
that
has
a
beautiful
appearance
the
only
downside
to
this
gem
of
a
beer
is
that
on
a
clean
palate
the
finish
will
start
to
turn
slightly
caustic
at
the
end
otherwise
the
flavors
mouthfeel
and
smell
jive
well
to
form
a
very
delicious
brew
one
of
my
favorite
red
ales
i
hope
to
get
some
more
this
coming
fall
now
that
i
go
to
csu
hopefully
i
can
get
is
straight
from
the
brewery
o
an
interesting
beer
that
pulls
off
a
nice
complexity
between
hop
and
malt
while
not
overwhelming
instead
maintaining
great
balance
overall
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
brew
not
the
best
nb
but
solid
rating
for
style
its
supurb
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
nice
foamy
slightly
off
white
head
smells
of
deep
caramelized
malt
with
chocolate
and
slight
floral
aroma
tastes
of
slight
chocolate
with
nice
pineyearthy
hop
bite
the
malt
dominates
at
first
then
the
hops
take
over
beer
is
carbonated
fine
and
for
a
lightmedium
body
it
goes
down
very
smooth
could
definately
see
throwing
a
couple
of
these
back
in
a
short
time
overall
a
very
good
beer
somewhat
watery
start
transitions
to
a
warming
and
mediumtofull
body
lightish
effervescence
is
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
as
is
the
hop
note
though
both
are
reduced
versions
thankfully
a
nice
brew
overall
but
hoppier
than
i
prefer
most
of
the
time
presentation
packaged
in
a

a
beautiful
day
in
mid
autumn
called
for
this
diverse
tasting
we
started
with
this
red
hoptober
ale
very
flavorfull
a
beautiful
pour
this
beer
from
new
belgium
brewery
was
a
perfect
beer
to
start
the
evening
nice
red
coloring
with
a
bright
head
smooth
with
a
slight
citrus
ending

piney
hopwave
followed
by
spicy
toasted
malt
backbone
not
sure
what
eldorado
hops
are
but
are
in
use
here
according
to
the
label
and
they
work
out
very
nicely
providing
a
flavorfull
piney
aspect
that
complements
the
spicy
malt
very
well
recommended
on
tap
at
la
jolla
brew
house
first
draft
beer
of
2013
so
i
made
sure
it
wasnt
memorable
i
loved
the
original
hoptober
so
it
is
no
surprise
that
i
like
the
amber
version
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
finger
and
a
half
froathy
slightly
off
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
slight
pine
hop
kick
the
taste
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
hoppy
red
starts
malty
then
there
is
a
kick
of
piney
slight
citrus
hop
followed
by
bittering
hops
that
clean
the
pallete
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
could
drink
the
heck
out
of
it
pretty
good
stuff
on
the
hoppy
side
for
the
style
o
no
complaints
other
than
the
aftertaste
that
just
seems
to
grow
would
definitely
drink
again
and
most
likely
will
end
up
trying
again
simply
due
to
the
best
by
date
on
this
bottle
was
the
week
before
i
bought
it
and
two
weeks
before
i
tried
it
o
solid
brew
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hoptober
name
i
wouldnt
be
knocking
down
doors
to
get
this
again
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
really
really
good
solid
amber
with
the
right
balance
of
malt
and
hop
overall
this
is
a
good
one
want
a
dark
amber
ale
but
you
also
want
an
ipa
this
is
perfect
well
balanced
hop
and
malt
flavor
are
extremely
well
thought
out
and
executed
very
well
drinkability
is
also
really
high
35
bottles
of
this
would
not
be
a
problem
for
a
friday
or
saturday
night
session
overall
very
nice
beer
and
happy
my
brother
brought
this
back
for
me
to
enjoy
in
boston
a
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
strong
grassy
piney
herbal
aroma
taste
was
a
bit
of
dark
caramel
up
front
followed
by
some
big
grassy
herbal
flavors
mouthfeel
was
good
overall
a
good
red
ale
that
i
would
get
again
probably
the
hoppiest
offering
i
have
had
from
nb
a
good
malty
hoppy
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
body
o
above
average
does
a
good
job
not
being
too
overpowering
with
hops
overall
impression
this
is
a
great
beer
just
what
you
want
in
the
fall
its
a
mild
pale
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
very
attractive
beer
something
id
really
like
to
drink
and
keep
drinking
the
nut
and
the
fireroasty
flavors
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
are
just
right
a
very
worth
while
beer
and
a
good
one
to
sip
with
a
pal
i
think
my
favorite
part
is
the
nutty
transitioning
into
the
hoppy
flavor
thats
just
excellent
o
this
is
a
great
beer
wish
i
bought
more
then
just
a
single
this
brew
is
a
mess
a
total
turn
off
with
too
many
random
flavorsaromas
i
cant
recommend
this
it
didnt
end
up
in
my
drain
but
its
certainly
one
you
drink
fast
not
in
a
good
way
in
some
respects
it
seems
unfair
to
review
this
because
i
love
fat
tire
so
much
this
brew
resembles
fat
tire
in
its
distinguishable
maltiness
but
has
a
nice
hint
of
citrus
hops
at
the
very
end
poured
with
a
nice
one
finger
creamy
head
it
had
significant
lacing
ruby
colored
it
had
the
scent
of
floral
hoppiness
but
not
the
typical
biscuit
of
fat
tire
the
flavor
is
of
quality
malt
with
a
hop
ending
flavorful
and
full
bodied
it
was
a
joy
to
drink
the
hunt
is
over
ahem
sorry
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
toffee
sharp
pine
needle
miscellaneous
greens
and
light
leek
there
may
or
may
not
be
some
mint
in
the
background
but
i
cant
tell
for
sure
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
the
mint
does
in
fact
come
through
in
the
midst
of
the
pine
the
hops
clash
amongst
themselves
while
also
clashing
with
the
toffee
not
sure
how
they
pulled
that
off
but
im
considering
giving
some
reluctant
props
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
i
feel
the
hops
and
malts
just
dont
cooperate
well
enough
in
this
beer
to
allow
me
to
enjoy
it
something
like
that
o
overall
nice
twist
on
an
amber
and
makes
it
a
better
beer
quite
enjoyable
this
offering
pours
up
a
deep
copper
amost
bronze
color
with
a
nice
khaki
head
there
is
decent
retention
and
world
class
lacing
if
there
is
such
a
thing
the
nose
is
floral
grass
nuts
and
biscuit
taste
is
very
dry
with
the
hop
profile
dominating
the
flavor
i
also
get
a
bit
of
citrus
fruit
upfront
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
not
completely
unpleasant
aftertaste
id
probably
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
actively
search
for
it
but
its
not
bad
especially
if
you
prefer
a
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
nbb
lineup
my
brother
and
i
shared
several
bottles
at
a
recent
tailgate
and
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
brew
recommended
d
this
beer
caught
me
off
guard
as
to
what
i
was
expecting
and
at
first
i
was
very
hesitant
to
enjoy
it
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
very
drinkable
i
hope
to
see
it
next
season
appearance
has
a
dark
ruby
red
color
supporting
a
healthy
head
giving
way
to
fair
lace
smell
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
with
aromas
of
citrus
and
caramel
malts
taste
holds
a
helping
of
hops
giving
way
to
citrusy
grapefruit
but
not
overpowering
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
fall
seasonal
oa
decent
amber
ale
but
depth
of
flavor
not
as
prevalent
as
others
o
this
is
what
i
consider
to
be
a
great
seasonal
beer
it
is
not
extreme
it
is
not
incredible
it
is
just
very
drinkable
for
the
fall
season
it
is
a
bit
different
than
most
of
the
others
out
there
in
that
there
are
at
least
initially
some
noticeable
hops
i
plan
to
drink
a
few
more
of
these
before
they
are
gone
this
year
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
long
lasting
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
quite
strong
definitely
some
earthy
notes
dark
fruit
slight
alcohol
and
a
little
yeast
taste
is
bitter
right
up
front
earthy
piney
bitterness
wonderful
fall
hop
character
slightly
sweet
tasting
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
this
beer
has
a
lingering
bite
to
the
finish
and
is
slightly
resin
like
in
the
mouthfeel
an
excellent
dark
pale
fall
style
for
sure
i
definitely
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try

musty
and

mostly
of
herbal

hop
spectrum
over
the
top
of
toasted
bread
slices
the
flavor
has
these
elements
but
also
includes
pine
and
grapefruit
pith
at
a
mediumlight
level
and
some
light
toasted
nut
flavors
join
the
party
as
the
glass
warms
up
its
a
good
interplay
between
the
nuttiness
the
toasted
bread
and
the
somewhat
higher
than
usual
hopping
for
an
amber
it
easily
crosses
the
line
into
typical
pa
hopping
strength
check
this
one
out
if
you
like
the
notion
of
mostly
herbal
hopping

toasted

malts

this
is
a

more
drinkable
than
ranger
well
made
brew
overall
a
fairly
tasty
brew
with
some
nice
mild
to
medium
hop
presence
and
decent
roasted
flavors
new
belgium
generally
produces
decent
beers
but
this
one
is
a
nice
surprise
a
bit
outside
the
box
but
well
worth
trying
overall
i
received
a
sixer
of
this
as
a
gift
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
but
it
myself
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
a
toned
down
ipa
its
actually
probably
best
described
as
what
you
might
get
if
you
blended
fat
tire
with
jubelale
poured
this
red
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a

poured
a
clear
reddish

a
thick
off

featured
excellent

left
ample
lacing
on

the
hoppiest
smelling
red
ale
i
have
come
across
pine
and
citric
notes
medium
in
body
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
red
ale
style
most
red
ales
are
sort
of
boring
not
much
sets
them
apart
however
this
ale
had
such
a
strong
hop
flavor
a
based
of
malted
grain
citrus
and
pine
throughout
the
session
well
balanced
great
take
on
an
ordinary
style
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
of
beer
hopforward
but
still
well
balanced
with
the
malts
something
thats
easy
to
get
through
a
6pack
of
overall
drinkability
one
of
best
if
not
the
best
from
new
belgium
overall
a
hoppy
aromatic
red
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear

with
a
short

head
roasted
smoky
malt
and
grapefruit
aromas
the
moutfheel
is
a
little
thin
and
wet
with
some
scrubbing
toward
the

and
a
powdery
finish
this
is
a
porter
meets
calofornia
pale
ale
coffee
up
front
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
being
picked
up
in
that
order
there
are
some
interesting
things
going
on
with
this
one
otherwise
its
average
o
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
the
name
justifies
it
very
good
fall
blend
great
buy
oa
surprisingly
good
beer
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
beer
was
good
o
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
beer
because
of
the
style
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
so
much
flavor
for
an
amber
and
im
glad
i
got
to
enjoy
a
whole
22oz
of
it
consider
me
impressed
i
hope
this
makes
a
return
next
fall
overall
not
quite
outstanding
but
solid
overall
with
almost
perfect
balance
definitely
tastes
like
fall
overall
this
is
a
light
ipa
that
has
been
carefully
balanced
with
some
darker
malts
achieving
a
killer
session
brew
this
is
a
highly
recommended
seasonal
by
me
and
it
is
my
favorite
new
belgium
beer
to
date
this
is
a
great
world
class
beer
i
love
it
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
octoberfest
lagers
abundant
this
time
of
year
this
one
is
definitely
hop
driven
but
the
malt
and
roast
flavor
keep
this
one
balanced
and
somewhat
quaffable
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
from
new
belgium
being
a
well
hopped
yet
balanced
and
smooth
take
on
an
american
amber
ale
that
had
a
really
solid
flavor
and
drinkability
to
it
ill
be
investing
in
a
six
pack
next
time
high
c
drink
i
dont
normally
like
ambersreds
and
this
kicks
the
shit
out
of
fat
tire
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
be
pretty
happy
actually
t
a
good
blend
of
caramel
malts
earthy
hops
pepper
campfire
and
some
faint
citrus
a
really
nice
beer
that
grows
on
you
the
more
you
drink
o
wow
i
didnt
expect
to
be
this
pleased
very
tasty
perhaps
complex
brew
from
new
belgium
favorite
part
is
that
there
are
many
flavors
to
choose
from
yet
nothing
seems
out
of
control
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
with
friends
but
i
like
it
on
the
warmer
end
i
would
recommend
and
buy
again
a
great
seasonregular
beer
savor
good

to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
caramel
caramel
hop
earth
and
earth
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
nutty
caramel
bread
caramel
hop
earth
and
earth
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
really
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
one
if
i
am
honest
i
had
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
from
other
friends
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
from
the
style
that
they
had
to
date
i
dunno
if
i
should
listen
to
these
people
anymore
there
were
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
going
on
here
for
the
style
however
everything
just
clashed
on
your
palate
all
at
once
and
there
was
no
chance
to
ever
really
recover
from
it
hate
that
was
the
case
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
again
o
im
always
scared
of
hop
full
beers
as
some
hops
when
used
fpr
flavoring
have
a
long
lingering
taste
this
however
while
has
a
very
noticable
hop
taste
the
taste
fades
rather
than
staying
strong
for
many
mins
after
your
last
sip
bitternes
levels
ballance
the
malt
and
body
well
so
oberall
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
that
seems
to
fit
the
season
perfectly
a
nice
effort
i
would
this
again
especially
at
8
a
sixer
overall
impression
a
good
tasting
beer
that
could
stand
to
have
a
more
ample
body
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
closer
to
the
porter
style
than
the
typical
fall
seasonal
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
season
just
the
same
overall
a
pretty
nice
hopped
up
red
ale
ripe
mix
of
hops
with
a
good
taste
of
caramel
and
subtle
roast
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
solid
fall
offering
with
some
hops
to
boot
o
very
pleasing
sipper
good
for
a
game
day
with
snacks
overall
very
interesting
beer
with
a
great
take
on
the
season
it
is
released
overall
this
cames
across
as
a
strange
flavor
profile
to
me
but
a
bit
different
for
a
red
ale
i
took
a
flyer
on
this
one
not
knowing
anything
about
it
when
i
picked
it
up
but
ill
definitely
get
some
more
it
is
a
well
balanced
delightful
pleasure
o
just
a
nice
beer
that
goes
well
with
the
season
its
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
with
ease
i
much
prefer
this
over
the
last
years

head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a

nice
foamy

clings
to
the

aromas
of

taste

floral

and

good
amount

on

on
the

for
a

great

balance
with

complexity
and
balance
no
cloying
flavors
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
creamy
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
amber
ale
great
hop
and
malt
profile
and
very
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
is
a
very
nice
style
example
my
first
new
belgium
and
i
am
impressed
had
on
tap
at
brasserie
brightwell
in
easton
md
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
slight
off
white
head
nice
aroma
that
prepares
for
an
exceptionally
smooth
sip
with
caramel
malts
hints
of
roast
spice
and
some
earthy
bite
the
flavor
follows
with
sweet
malts
and
balancing
spice
biscuts
toffee
nicely
light
bitter
finish
finishes
very
clean
for
the
style
and
keeps
you
wanting
more
the
mouth
is
decent
with
a
bit
of
heft
offset
by
active
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
several
and
it
goes
great
with
food
i
liked
the
3
price
on
thirsty
thursdays
that
is
a
deal
for
a
beer
this
good
a
beautiful
pour
huge
frothy
tan
head
over
a
bold
deep
amberdark
brown
color
very
inviting
aroma
is
filled
with
fresh
hops
mainly
piney
with
toasty
and
herbal
notes
and
a
whiff
of
ester
and
sweet
fruit
the
taste
gives
a
nice
back
and
forth
quite
balanced
between
hoppy
bite
and
fruity
sweetness
i
detected
what
i
would
describe
as
a
chocolatecherry
taste
among
the
other
flavors
breaking
through
nice
body
with
a
clean
fresh
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
good
one
o
what
an
excellent
beer
for
any
season
i
have
had
it
on
tap
and
in
bottle
really
good
new
belgium
scores
with
this
one
i
feel
2012
is
much
better
than
2011
pretty
good
brew
reminds
me
of
their
classic
hoptober
offering
but
with
a
darker
malt
component
nice
o
as
a
fall
seasonal
brew
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
outside
of
pumpkin
ales
and
octoberfests
o
this
is
great
for
the
style
almost
blurs
the
line
between
amber
ale
and
ipa
overall
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
fall
seasonal
that
seems
to
successfully
capture
the
essence
of
autumn
in
a
bottle
whats
unique
about
this
offering
is
that
without
being
an
ofest
or
pumpkin
ale
red
hoptober
delivers
the
fall
and
early
winter
personality
in
a
bottle
like
no
other
concoction
sampled
before
definitely
a
winner
and
deserving
of
praise
definately
a
solid
red
ale
that
is
a
good
change
of
pace
to
the
typical
oktoberfest
and
horrible
pumpkin
beers
i
enjoyed
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
red
hoptober
is
a
deep
bronzered
color
with
a
dense
yet
airy
head
that
leaves
sticky
gobs
of
lacing
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
smell
is
a
mix
of
spicey
hops
and
caramel
malt
flavor
is
initially
dominated
by
the
hops
floral
and
spicy
transitioning
to
slighly
malty
sweet
and
finishes
amazingly
neutral
and
clean
for
a
beer
with
that
kind
of
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
a
thick
but
inactive
carbonation
overall
i
must
say
that
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
definitely
a
new
favorite
from
nb
i
am
impressed
for
some
reason
i
went
into
this
expecting
a
marzen
style
and
was
shocked
bt
the
initial
sip
after
actually
reading
the
bottle
i
sipped
again
now
opening
myself
up
to
whatever
they
want
there
this
is
a
delightful
beer
deep
aroma
that
hits
you
on
the
nose
with
spicyness
a
deep
amber
coloring
and
a
full
body
red
hoptober
has
made
me
a
fan
of
new
belguim
in
one
beer
well
done
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
filmy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
strong
with
a
caramel
scent
dominating
with
some
piney
hops
along
with
a
hint
of
tangerine
and
sugar
it
tastes
more
hoppy
than
the
smell
there
is
a
nice
piney
base
with
some
sweet
toasty
malt
and
a
nice
finish
with
some
fruity
flavors
the
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
very
nice
beer
here
overall
a
very
good
amber
nicely
hopped
to
compliment
a
rich
malty
backbone
more
assertive
than
your
average
amber
o
nice
fall
seasonal
maybe
even
more
deserving
of
a
fullon
cool
fall
day
almost
more
of
an
american
nut
brown
sort
of
beer
nicely
balanced
and
an
easy
drinker
appropriately
priced
3
on
sale
4
regular
per
22
oz
o
one
of
new
belgiums
more
solid
offerings
extremely
enjoyable
and
truly
drinkable
o
it
almost
seems
like
new
belgium
cant
go
wrong
this
new
fall
seasonal
is
worth
trying
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppy
malty
red
ale
seems
perfect
for
the
changing
season
nice
medium
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
fantastic
beer
thats
nicely
complex
i
love
how
the
taste
evolved
drinking
this
beer
is
a
certainly
a
wonderful
experience
malt
brown
sugar
and
darker
barleys
are
the
predominant
flavors
cascade
hops
during
the
drink
eldorado
on
the
finish
and
beltch
very
well
balanced
hoppieness
clear
and
present
hop
flavor
without
being
excessively
bitter
i
worked
my
way
through
a
six
pack
of
this
during
the
last
month
and
have
gotten
into
it
more
as
the
weather
cooled
my
biggest
problem
is
that
they
replaced
the
golden
hoptober
with
this
i
would
have
rather
enjoyed
the
regular
hoptober
in
late
summer
early
fall
and
enjoyed
this
ale
in
the
late
autumn
early
winter
but
its
their
brewery
ill
probably
enjoy
another
sixer
of
this
before
its
gone
from
notes
8

d
very
sessionable
o
nice
hoppines
to
this
amber
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
for
a
late
summer
fall
summer
seasonal
this
absolutely
stands
out
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
its
not
the
best
example
of
a
red
ale
its
got
more
brown
ale
aspects
but
i
would
say
that
its
a
very
good
example
of
a
fall
seasonal
beer
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
the
flavors
did
a
really
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
bomber
would
be
enough
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
say
two
would
be
impossible
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
great
taste
and
aroma
i
really
like
how
the
hops
contrast
the
toasted
malts
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
was
a
little
to
high
but
that
seemed
to
be
the
only
thing
that
didnt
work
that
well
with
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
in
fact
i
already
went
back
and
got
three
more
bottles
before
they
jacked
up
the
price
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
jut
about
anyone
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
it
turned
out
to
be
the
best
out
of
the
four
bombers
released
in
michigan
by
new
belgium
and
so
far
its
my
favorite
fall
seasonal
of
the
year
good
job
new
belgium
this
is
one
great
fall
time
beer
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
this
beer
intrigues
me
because
of
its
mixed
beer
style
pedigree
which
is
evident
in
the
taste
its
like
someone
took
red
ale
and
an
ipa
and
forced
them
to
have
a
love
child
theres
also
something
about
the
taste
that
is
just
really
distinct
and
very
delicious
the
taste
is
complex
bitter
at
the
start
but
not
too
much
then
as
it
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
sweetness
and
caramel
flavor
just
comes
through
great
beer
very
happy
that
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
this
seasonal
a
nice
change
from
the
octoberfests
and
pumpkins
brews
that
everyone
is
putting
out
22oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
deep
red
nearly
brown
nice
tall
frothy
offwhite
head
holds
good
retention
and
leaves
killer
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
malty
caramel
citric
hop
hop
pelletlike
bready
biscuity
tastes
are
bready
caramely
biscuity
spicy
hop
crisp
fresh
and
again
that
pellet
hop
characteristic
somewhat
grassy
and
fresh
thinner
bodied
god
carbonation
finishes
clean
overall
i
liked
this
one
but
maybe
it
could
have
used
another
week
or
2
in
the
bottle
ive
never
had
a
beer
where
the
hops
smell
and
taste
like
hop
pellets
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
just
different
ill
probably
pick
up
another
one
of
these
before
the
season
is
gone
especially
at
3
49
a
bomber
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
they
didnt
bring
back
the
hoptober
from
last
year
but
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
good
too
reddish
amber
color
good
lacing
smell
is
malts
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
i
sometimes
get
that
from
red
ales
hints
of
grassy
hops
flavor
is
alternating
between
grassy
hops
melon
rind
and
chewy
malt
i
think
the
old
hoptober
was
better
but
this
was
alright
pours
a
dark
heavily
steeped
tealike
color
dark
in
the
shadows
deep
umber
in
light
and
its
darkness
makes
me
fear
this
one
might
be
a
maltbomb
too
and
actually
now
that
i
think
of
it
im
not
really
sure
often
what
looks
good
and
what
looks
good
kinda
maybe
because
most
beer
looks
good
to
me
anyway
when
you
think
of
it
smell
is
a
bit
malt
and
caramel
and
sweet
and
hops
synthetic
like
notes
not
bad
either
but
overall
all
its
scent
is
muted
surely
tastes
great
whew
good
balance
on
the
grains
and
not
bombed
out
on
the
sweetness
or
the
malt
and
coffee
and
nice
hops
i
get
the
centennial
for
sure
and
it
seems
to
dominate
the
others
hidden
below
mouthfeel
is
great
carbonation
is
active
and
fussy
and
refreshing
and
not
chewy
or
boggy
or
anything
i
really
like
this
and
it
could
be
because
its
friday
eve
too
either
way
ill
buy
again
o
this
is
a
really
nice
tasty
brew
that
reminds
me
more
of
winter
than
fall
i
really
enjoyed
its
warming
flavors
of
cocoa
and
bark
the
appearance
couldnt
really
be
much
better
either
just
a
great
beer
from
new
belgium
brewing
and
i
would
definitely
buy
another
six
pack
cheers
o
full
flavor
looks
great
not
overbearing
great
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
a
rich

off

crown
atop
that
never
completely
settles
a
thick

mass
is

sharp
piney
hops
come
out
well
after
the
pour
along
with
underlying
biscuit
maltthe
hop
aromas
did
fade
quite
a
bit
after
the
pour
but
after
a
good
swirl
they
come
out
pretty
dry
on
the
palate
except
for
a
small
amount
of
brown
sugar
flavorthe
hops
are
not
nearly
as
big
as
in
the
nose
but
they
meld
with
the
crisp
dryer
slightly
roasted
malt
base
its
got
some
good
things
going
onits
not
an
overly
complex
or
a
wowing
beer
but
its
not
bad
overy
nice
to
try
but
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
its
nose
and
look
predecessors
and
tasty
varieties
look
forward
to
very
drinkable
seasonal
hoppy
red
ale
i
think
ill
have
another
o
nothing
super
special
however
again
like
with
the
tripel
from
new
belgium
and
in
this
case
a
better
example
it
is
a
good

flavor
i
like
the
hops
flavor
in
beer
but
feel
many
craft
brewers
are
just
adding
more
and
more
hops
to
make
an
impresssion
that
is
not
the
case
with
this
brew
just
found
this
here
in
michigan
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
a
beautifully
dark
amber
with
a
big
khaki
head
better
lacing
would
have
give
appearance
a
5
for
sure
a
thickly
sweet
and
floral
aroma
of
some
caramel
a
hint
of
some
coffee
bread
and
earthy
florals
from
the
dry
hops
taste
followed
suit
floral
and
a
touch
bitter
from
the
hops
the
big
thick
caramel
malt
belly
offer
of
a
dose
of
some
toffee
coffee
and
bread
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
more
the
sweet
syrupy
and
rather
chewy
base
of
this
beer
does
show
itself
a
full
body
on
this
one
with
enough
activity
to
give
it
some
life
but
not
enough
to
properly
counter
the
chewiness
of
it
right
now
in
the
warmth
of
the
closing
summer
it
is
a
bit
too
heavy
come
fall
it
might
hit
the
spot
overall
another
nice
surprise
from
new
blegium
though
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
so
surprised
at
this
point
as
i
have
enjoyed
each
of
their
last
3
seasonals
dig
somersault
and
now
this
this
is
definitely
more
of
a
fall
beer
than
a
late
summer
beer
as
nb
claims
this
to
also
be
its
heavy
and
sweet
and
will
go
much
better
with
the
drop
in
weather
and
shortening
of
the
days
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
definitely
not
the
regular
hoptober
that
i
miss
so
much
this
is
roasty
and
nutty
but
also
very
hoppy
im
not
disappointed
at
all
i
will
probably
try
this
again
overall
a
tasty
beer
tried
it
because
this
was
in
the
slot
where
belgo
usually
is
at
vons
overall
a
very
solid
amber
somewhat
complex
plenty
flavorful
but
really
easy
to
drink
nice
offering
from
new
belgium
who
seems
to
constantly
be
tinkering
withchanging
their
seasonals
d
another
nice
new
offering
from
nb
above
average
and
enjoyable
slightly
unique
from
the
standard
american
amber
style
with
some
light
nutty
chocolate
roast
notes
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
a
lovely
sip
uh
i
mean
quaff
no
doubt
one
of
the
better
fall
seasonals
out
there
a
must
try
imo
good
beer
overall
but
still
not
quite
what
i
would
picture
an
amberred
ale
o
this
is
a
really
nice
amber
ale
its
tasty
drinkable
and
fits
the
style
im
not
entirely
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
being
a
fall
seasonal
but
i
guess
it
fits
the
bill
as
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
toasty
malt
in
the
heart
of
autumn
id
rather
reach
for
a
pumpkin
ale
or
an
oktoberfest
beer
but
this
beer
certainly
works
well
in
the
transitional
period
between
summer
and
fall
bottom
line
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
new
belgium
o
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
with
more
hops
and
black
ale
leanings
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
but
it
was
interesting
while
it
was
still
in
my
glass
not
surprisingly
of
course
it
went
quick
o
a
nice
brew
tasty
now
and
tasty
later
in
the
fall
this
is
a
winner
for
nb
o
an
excellent
example
of
a
hoppy
fall
beer
it
is
easy
to
get
carried
away
with
the
german
malts
at
this
time
of
year
so
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
taste
is
a
melding
of
roasty
malt
tones
with
bitter
hops
smack
at
the
finish
an
unusual
collision
of
styles
and
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
red
hoptober
is
not
my
favorite
of
new
belgiums
seasonals
after
a
few
sips
the
mouthfeel
is
still
somewhat
malty
but
the
aftertaste
is
unmistakebly
hoppy
bitterness
not
much
nose
to
this
one
beside
a
hint
of
ester
part
floral
part
fruity
nice
bold
red
color
although
the
relative
humidity
in
austin
this
time
of
year
fogs
up
the
glass
pretty
good
and
i
was
sitting
indoors
so
my
assessment
of
its
appearance
may
be
a
tad
inaccurate
o
i
fully
enjoyed
this
brew
my
first
instinct
when
i
hear
of
red
ales
are
more
malt
forward
beers
but
it
seems
i
am
fooled
many
a
time
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
emphasis
on
hops
but
in
that
i
did
expect
a
little
more
body
to
stay
balanced
this
beer
was
great
but
it
could
have
used
more
malt
depth
the
hops
did
come
through
very
bright
and
distinguishable
overall
actually
its
not
a
bad
little
beer
at
all
not
at
all
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
preference
for
this
season
i
do
not
find
balance
in
this
one
overall
great
falltime
red
ale
great
color
aroma
and
flavor
are
balanced
well
between
malty
and
hoppy
great
beer
overall
a
nice
summerintofall
type
of
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
like
fat
tire
and
1554
like
a
more
hoppy
90
shilling
this
is
a
big
improvement
from
the
hoptober
golden
ale
that
was
around
last
year
it
pours
perfect
autumn
amber
color
deep
deep
copper
with
a
tan
head
an
inch
or
so
high
smells
like
a
fresh
hopped
odell
90
shilling
its
got
the
same
malt
profile
english
and
caramely
the
hops
though
take
the
taste
over
bitter
and
well
selected
the
red
malts
arent
as
prominent
as
i
thought
they
would
be
but
they
balance
the
intense
hops
pretty
well
its
like
a
dark
ipa
that
isnt
quite
a
black
beer
feel
is
good
fuller
body
and
smooth
to
drink
id
have
a
few
of
these
but
they
get
a
little
filling
overall
a
nice
upgrade
to
the
new
belgium
fall
offering
the
bjcp
style
guidelines
refer
to
this
style
as
an
american
pale
ale
with
more
body
more
caramel
richness
and
a
balance
more
towards
malt
than
hops
this
brew
pulls
that
off
nicely
overall
nicely
balanced
ale
that
straddles
the
line
between
a
red
ale
and
a
black
ale
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
the
previous
standard
hoptober
the
body
was
ok
but
on
the
thinnish
side
for
the
style
drinkability
was
ok
but
that
will
depend
on
your
taste
for
the
peatroast
taste
overall
an
ok
beer
one
im
glad
i
tried
but
im
not
sure
ill
have
another
hoppy
red
ale
is
one
of
my
beer
styles
love
their
red
colour
their
rich
toffee
and
slight
roast
malt
character
and
their
abundance
of
hops
red
hoptober
delivers
all
of
these
attributes
in
spades
looks
red
okay
criteria
number
one
delivered
smells
of
pungent
pine
pithy
citrus
and
toffee
a
strong
nose
and
something
new
belgium
seems
to
pull
off
very
well
sometimes
though
i
feel
like
nb
beer
tends
to
fall
short
of
what
the
aroma
promises
flavour
wise
when
it
comes
to
their
hop
centric
beers
not
red
hoptober
sweet
citrus
fruit
hits
first
followed
by
toffee
and
slight
roast
ample
hop
bitterness
finishes
the
swollow
all
in
all
very
pleasing
like
i
said
im
fond
of
hoppy
reds
and
this
one
shines
this
is
good
though
i
dont
see
myself
buying
more
good
doesnt
always
equate
to
great
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
wont
buy
a
sixpack
of
it
but
id
encourage
a
friend
to
try
a
pint
o
ok
im
biased
i
do
like
just
about
everything
nb
produces
and
i
also
seem
to
like
every
fall
seasonal
i
try
perhaps
the
deck
and
the
cool
air
are
working
their
magic
this
one
will
only
be
with
us
for
a
short
time
so
lets
enjoy
it
while
we
can
pours
a
clear
amber
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
strong
earthy
malt
citrus
hops
slight
dry
hop
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
earthy
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
slight
hop
overall
great
appearance
good
feel
and
good
blend
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
rubytinged
copper
with
a
thick
pale
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
very
generous
lacing
malty
aroma
has
a
hoppy
hay
overtone
and
a
firm
earthy
note
malty
earthy
flavor
has
hoppy
and
clove
notes
its
a
little
like
drinking
good
mulch
but
i
mean
that
in
a
positive
way
body
is
only
average
but
fizz
is
strong
and
lively
finish
is
woody
but
not
bitter
another
winner
from
new
belgium
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
like
new
belgium
products
as
a
rule
but
this
one
is
quite
good
its
good
from
a
bottle
but
much
better
on
draft
from
what
i
gathered
this
one
was
the
original
hoptober
with
a
bigger
malt
bill
and
some
interesting
bittering
hops
added
it
definitely
had
a
little
more
substance
than
its
stripped
down
counterpart
yet
another
solid
seasonal
from
new
belgium
i
like
it
for
a
fall
seasonal
it
really
does
deliver
in
that
i
get
more
malt
and
heft
but
i
still
get
those
hops
i
love
too
rather
than
just
make
another
hoppy
ale
and
call
it
a
fall
seasonal
im
glad
they
truly
amped
up
the
malts
a
bit
filling
so
two
would
probably
be
my
max
in
an
evening
just
drink
it
cold
as
it
warmed
i
felt
it
becoming
a
little
too
thick
beautiful
looking
beer
and
the
hoppy
aroma
is
downright
sublime
but
i
didnt
think
this
beer
finished
well
i
would
mirror
a
lot
of
others
observations
that
it
has
a
bit
of
an
earthy
aroma
and
flavor
but
just
a
bit
too
strong
of
an
aftertaste
for
my
liking
overall
solid
beer
though
new
belgium
and
i
have
a
lovehate
relationship
i
cant
stand
fat
tire
but
the
winter
ale
they
put
out
this
winter
wasis
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
i
figured
this
was
worth
a
try
the
only
problem
is
that
it
feels
very
fizzy
and
watery
on
the
finish
feels
dry
medium
body
and
leaves
the
palate
fuzzy
if
you
know
what
i
mean
overall
a
really
good
fall
seasonal
in
my
opinion
it
is
something
unique
and
is
really
quite
drinkable
definitely
worth
picking
up
o
highly
enjoyable
seasonal
offering
right
here
i
really
enjoy
amber
ales
that
incorporate
more
hops
this
one
is
more
pine
and
floral
than
citrus
but
it
works
well
glad
to
recommend
this
one

carbonation
is
somewhere
between
low
and
medium

a
lighter
body
than
expected
its
a
smooth
drink
and
makes
me
want
more
good
job
new
belgium
was
surprised
at
how
little
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
musty
smell
it
was
something
like
furniture
polish
the
taste
was
similar
im
not
sure
if
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
as
i
think
new
belgium
usually
makes
solid
beers
i
overall
a
nice
beer
but
like
too
many
hoppy
beers
not
nice
enough
to
have
me
prefer
over
a
victory
or
even
a
sierra
nevada
o
very
nice
when
i
cracked
the
bottle
all
i
smelt
was
hops
then
i
poured
it
and
everything
mixed
together
well
a
brew
with
excellent
balance
but
a
strong
flavor
in
each
the
hop
and
grain
profile
it
is
a
beer
that
is
fit
for
a
beer
geek
as
the
different
flavors
come
one
after
another
overall
the
definition
of
a
4
0
beer
in
my
opinion
as
stated
before
i
dont
like
red
ales
that
much
but
i
do
love
new
belgium
and
feel
like
i
often
may
overrate
their
releases
this
time
i
feel
im
being
subjectively
fair
and
giving
it
exactly
what
it
deserves
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
6
998
99
per
6
pack
and
i
recommend
it
for
anyone
who
likes
ales
of
any
type
good
stuff
body
is
right
on
great
drinker
a
lot
of
flavor
to
this
red
ale
not
bad
but
was
hoping
for
more
from
these
guys
overall
its
ok
and
has
some
decent
bitterness
i
personally
dont
care
for
the
biscuity
malts
or
the
hop
flavors
though
o
not
really
a
fan
of
red
ales
but
this
one
is
alright
with
me
pretty
much
my
favorite
so
far
it
for
sure
the
most
attractive
o
a
grand
new
addition

i
like

so
this
hit
the
spot
with
regard
to
that
solid
all
around
overall
you
wont
find
a
dull
moment
with
this
dark
rich
complex
brew
very
satisfying
glad
i
tried
it
the
burnt
umber
colored
body
was
clear
and
topped
by
a
two
finger
thick
foamy
beige
head
i
could
smell
the
bright
hops
even
before
bringing
the
glass
up
to
the
nose
once
i
did
the
nose
was
dominated
by
piney
earthy
spicy
and
musty
hops
as
anticipated
the
taste
was
quite
bitter
and
earthy
with
a
flash
of
brown
sugar
mid
palette
and
a
carbonated
drying
finish
the
body
felt
medium
thick
oily
and
soft
this
is
better
than
the
typical
new
belgium
seasonal
and
approaches
the
quality
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
o
a
nice
enough
red
ale
though
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
character
to
come
through
its
not
bad
tasting
it
just
never
gets
really
interesting
it
does
seem
a
bit
like
a
beefed
up
fat
tire
a
solid
drinking
beer
but
nothing
to
make
you
say
wow
o
seasonal
releases
seem
to
be
departing
their
seasons
with
more
haste
each
year
and
fall
is
no
stranger
to
that
but
red
hoptober
seems
to
bridge
the
gap
nicely
offering
some
toasted
malt
and
enough
crisp
hop
to
battle
the
ongoing
heat
as
the
days
with
almost
painstakingly
slow
speed
grow
cooler
i
can
certainly
get
behind
this
beer
for
now
what
pains
me
though
is
its
midnovember
best
by
date
after
all
if
the
weathers
course
is
any
indication
thats
when
red
hoptober
and
its
ilk
will
be
truly
at
their
prime
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
from
the
instant
i
opened
and
poured
it
one
because
of
its
appearancei
wasnt
expecting
something
with
such
a
rich
deep
amber
brown
hue
and
literally
two
solid
fingers
of
creamy
foam
topping
it
and
two
the
aromaoh
what
an
aroma
from
the
instant
i
cracked
this
open
i
could
smell
it
first
impressions
are
of
chocolate
maltjust
this
wonderfully
bright
bouquet
of
roast
and
chocolate
malt
that
comes
across
its
pleasing
and
another
surprise
the
flavor
cracks
with
a
smooth
malt
like
an
amber
and
a
defined
distinct
bitterness
theres
a
pleasing
hoppiness
that
develops
and
gives
this
some
kick
not
sure
where
this
beer
fits
in
the
grand
scheme
of
thingsits
a
hoppy
amber
or
a
malty
ipa
or
just
something
altogether
delicious
o
an
interesting
and
solid
beer
overall
the
hop
and
brown
ale
notes
dont
blend
very
well
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
have
to
admit
i
do
not
like
this
amberred
ale
at
all
im
getting
tired
of
new
belgiums
beers
all
tasting
the
same
with
the
same
hop
profile
and
besides
i
like
redsambers
to
be
malty
toasty
and
sweet
not
bitter
and
sour
like
this
thing
despite
its
name
of
red
hoptober
their
original
hoptober
brew
last
year
was
phenomenal
this
one
not
so
much
the
initial
taste
is
of
grain
husk
and
toasted
malt
then
the
citrus
hop
kicks
in
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
i
really
like
the
cascade
and
toasted
malt
finish
the
beer
is
medium
body
and
has
a
smooth
feel
to
it
it
has
good
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
a
good
amber
or
brown
ale
on
its
own
but
the
addition
of
citrus
hops
kicks
it
up
a
notch
d
would
be
better
enjoyed
with
food
o
i
am
pretty
meh
on
most
of
the
recent
nb
offering
and
on
ambers
in
general
when
you
combine
the
two
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
at
the
results
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
but
it
on
the
have
again

average
at

this
is
a
nice

man
does
it

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
yet
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
have
sought
out
this
beer
when
traveling
in
the
west
love
it
keg
of
boont
ale
drank
ive
always
enjoyed
amber
ales
but
this
one
was
really
special
it
was
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
would
buy
again
a
fond
remembrance
from
my
period
in
the
valley
i
love
anderson
purchased
in

very
drinkable
amber
ale
reasonable
lacing
and
light
mouth
feel
maybe
too
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
the
highly
hopped
ipas
note
i
give
high
ratings
if
i
like
the
beer
not
very
tasty
compared
to
most
ambers
ive
had
kind
of
a
fruity
taste
not
a
true
amber
in
my
opinion
good
brown
ale
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
low
hops
flavor
low
carbonation
little
to
no
lacing
very
drinkable
sweet
not
to
bitter
really
sweet
malty
taste
smooth
mouthfeel
and
finish
easy
drinkin
grapefruit
bite
but
not
a
bitter
after
taste
smooth
i
like
this
one
very
sweet
modest
ale
goes
down
easy
like
sippin
on
juice
very

starts
sweet
and
finishes
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
but
malts
still
prevail
medium
body
and
carbonation
strange
caramelly
sweet
almost
marshmallow
aroma
initially
fades
to
slightly
fruity
floral
hops
and
toasted
nutty
malt
flavor
reveals
that
same
slightly
odd
caramel
overly
sweet
character
reminiscent
of
banana
which
is
countered
by
bready
dryness
in
the
finish
muddled
citrus
floral
hops
and
light
resin
lie
underneath
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
overall
this
is
one
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
the
balance
between
the
flavorful
malt
and
zesty
but
not
overpowering
hops
is
ideal
imagine
an
english
bitters
with
the
volume
turned
up
a
click
or
two
imho
american
ambers
such
as
this
one
are
underappreciated
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
prime
example
of
an
amber
ale
but
something
different
i
expected
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
aroma
im
wondering
if
this
beer
may
possibly
have
been
on
the
shelf
at
the
beer
store
a
bit
too
long
its
a
nice
beer
overall
but
id
like
to
sample
another
to
see
if
its
age
or
not
this
one
started
very
well
with
the
smell
being
a
particular
highlight
but
sadly
things
started
to
fade
slightly
after
that
with
the
taste
seeming
a
little
watery
more
so
that
i
would
have
liked
not
one
id
pick
up
again
im
afraid
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
brew
is
incredibly
refreshing
though
it
isnt
the
easiest
to
pour
from
the
tap
the
appearance
is
amazing
it
is
a
nice
dark
amber
color
the
head
floats
atop
an
aesthetically
pleasing
addition
when
it
hits
my
mouth
i
think
caramel
the
toasted
carmel
hops
are
prime
it
is
a
first
class
amber
ale
that
all
should
experience

the
beer
poured
a
amber
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
looking
good
so
far
the
smell
was
caramel
and
nice
however
the
beer
was
lacking
in
the
taste
department
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
i
might
try
this
one
again
if
i
could
find
it
on
tap
overall
a
very
good
session
ale
boont
amber
ale
is
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
beer
a
malty
treat
that
is
fruity
and
hoppy
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
looking
for
the
intense
sweetness
of
this
malty
style
not
a
session
beer
to
me
but
a
flavorful
brew
that
showcases
malt
caramel
and
fruit
in
a
very
enjoyable
way

still
all
in

i
liked
this
not
normally
crazy
about
the
style

this
one
at

stands
up
and
tries
to
deliver
some
basic
flavor
and
does
so
admirably
its
not
a
dull

like
a

to

a
very
enjoyable
offering
i
like
andersons
other
brews
so
was
excited
to
try
this
one
would
probably
not
go
back
to
it
unless
i
needed
a
refresher
after
a
game
of
tennis
summary
nice
not
a
bad
amber
ale
a
little
more
hoppy
up
front
than
im
used
to
but
still
good
nice
aftertaste
a
dark
but
clear
amber
brown
one
finger
of
brownish
white
head
smells
like
toasted
bread
caramel
grassy
hops
taste
follows
with
good
nutty
sweetness
mainly
sweettoastednutty
but
a
decent
bitterness
on
the
finish
smooth
and
creamy
not
too
much
carbonation
refreshing
and
tasty
a
well
done
amber
ale
the
hop
profile
is
balanced
and
really
highlights
the
malts
overall
an
excellent
amber
well
balanced
and
delicious
would
definitely
get
again
and
would
recommend
this
highly
overall
a
regular
amber
ale
but
not
remarkable
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
full
head
tan
which
laced
well
and
lasted
appearance
was
a
hazy
ruby
look
aroma
was
mild
with
malty
notes
taste
was
of
caramel
and
toffee
wirh
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
lingering
slight
malt
aftertasrte
not
bad
a
little
fruity
for
me
when
it
comes
to
amber
ales
but
its
nice
dark
fruitiness
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
breaks
it
up
a
bit
just
enough
hop
to
balance
with
lingering
sweetness
pretty
clean
with
a
few
things
that
throw
that
off
fruitiness
throws
the
cleanliness
of
the
brew
off
a
bit
and
the
body
breaks
a
little
thin
but
otherwise
pretty
nice
especially
as
a
summer
sipper
in
a
can
an
exceptional
beer
that
features
terrific
balance
in
body
and
taste
great
color
with
a
very
aromatic
nose
this
is
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
i
have
ever
tasted
at
only
5
80
abv
this
beer
can
get
you
in
to
trouble
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
the
best
amber
beer
i
have
tasted
in
months
a
decent
drinking
amber
ale
overall
its
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
or
to
have
as
a
sessional
during
the
cooler
fall
months
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
solid
amber
ale
that
deserves
a
spot
in
everybodys
fridge
cheers
overall
this
is
a
solid
red
ale
from
anderson
valley
but
it
does
not
really
pop
for
me
its
a
great
amber
ale
for
sure
and
quite
drinkable
beautifully
clear
red
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
good
lacing
nose
had
lots
of
sweet
and
yeast
fruitiness
featuring
notes
of
raspberry
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
biscuit
malt
core
raspberry
is
a
lovely
segue
into
the
mild
short
hop
finish
hops
have
a
bit
of
tea
leaf
and
deposit
just
a
trace
of
oil
on
the
tongue
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
smooth
carbonation
highly
drinkable
and
one
i
will
have
over
and
over
story
i
heard
about
this
beer
on
the
label
is
a
bear
with
deer
antlers
a
beer
and
it
is
said
that
if
you
drink
enough
of
these
and
wonder
out
into
the
forest
you
can
see
this
so
called
beer
though
that
was
a
cheeky
story
haha
rjt
o
mild
but
fairly
flavorful
i
would
put
this
more
into
the
realm
of
a
brown
because
of
the
mild
hop
but
still
a
solid
beer
from
a
12
ounce
can
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
small
white
head
its
an
average
looking
amber
ale
the
smell
is
of
toast
and
crackers
malty
some
fruit
and
distant
earthy
hops
but
mostly
a
lightly
toasty
bready
scent
the
taste
is
somewhat
tilted
sweet
but
is
well
balanced
malt
comes
through
in
the
taste
as
well
but
this
is
not
a
sweet
brew
medium
in
body
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
this
is
a
nofrills
amber
all
solid
and
drinkable
o
very
good
drinkability
moderately
good
ale
good
session
beer
and
on
sweet
side
without
cloying
complex
balanced
and
subtle
all
at
once
must
try
again
however
i
prefer
smuttynose
red
tail
and
rogue
in
this
style
great
ale
it
should
please
both
malt
lovers
and
hopheads
given
its
balance
and
if
you
leave
in
a
country
with
competitive
prices
it
is
also
great
as
a
premium
session
beer
o
this
beer
was
a
regular
in
my
fridge
for
a
long
time
when
i
lived
in
nc
but
since
moving
to
the
nyc
area
i
just
dont
find
it
as
often
i
find
this
beer
to
be
enjoyable
a
touch
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
an
easy
drinker
copper
hued
with
an
inch
of
white
foam
on
top
the
aroma
brings
some
bread
biscuits
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
similar
flavor
with
just
a
tad
of
citrus
and
some
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
with
crisp
carbonation
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
while
i
dont
drink
beers
of
this
style
too
often
i
found
this
quaffable
a
pretty
good
easy
drinker
that
tends
to
straddle
the
line
for
the
stylenot
too
malty
and
not
too
hoppy
flavour
intensity
itself
is
rather
mild
but
still
well
enough
present
a
decent
pick
for
a
session
beer
o
very
good
drinkability
excellent
ale
great
for
a
whole
day
session
beer
the
verdict
not
bad
a
fairly
solid
decently
balanced
amber
ale
it
would
be
perfect
with
a
sampler
plate
of
appetizers
pint
on
tap
at
the
crows
nest
in
santa
cruz
this
brew
is
a
very
attractive
copper
with
an
orangish
hue
clear
and
served
without
a
head
aromas
of
slightly
toasted
barley
and
a
bit
of
orange
like
fruitiness
flavor
is
fresh
and
crisp
clean
toasted
slightly
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
nice
fruity
hop
finishslightly
bittering
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
medium
high
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
well
done
beerclean
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
flavor
boont
amber
ale
the
bottle
says
deep
copper
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
rich
aroma
of
caramel
and
a
suntoasted
grain
elegantly
meshed
with
a
mellow
noble
hop
aroma
a
fullbodied
malt
flavor
is
supported
by
a
refreshing
mild
hop
bitterness
with
herbal
hoppy
aromas
lending
itself
to
a
long
clean
finish
the
noble
hops
give
this
brew
a
lager
flavor
that
i
find
displeasing
as
its
really
out
of
style
and
not
at
all
what
i
was
anticipating
the
mouthfeel
however
was
amazing
and
was
what
kept
me
wanting
to
drink
the
rest
of
the
bottle
o
a
very
nice
beer
overall
theres
a
richness
to
it
so
although
it
is
only
5
8
abv
i
would
probably
stop
at
two
rather
than
say
its
sessionable
avbc
has
such
a
great
variety
of
outstanding
beers
each
with
strong
points
delicious
i
had
this
years
back
and
havent
had
it
since
i
almost
forgot
how
good
this
is
it
is
easily
one
of
my
top
choices
for
an
amber
ale
its
a
great
beer
to
check
your
palate
on
further
proof
that
you
dont
have
to
be
above
6
abv
to
be
flavorful
and
praiseworthy
avbc
might
not
release
the
latest
and
greatest
and
might
not
be
the
grand
innovators
but
making
highquality
easy
drinking
brews
day
in
and
day
out
is
supersexy
to
me
o
definitely
a
tasty
and
balanced
amber
ale
superb
drinkability
anderson
valley
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
brew
was
uniqueness
of
the
hops
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavoring
the
nose
really
wakes
you
up
taking
you
to
a
very
foody
organic
place
in
your
thoughts
the
flavoring
follows
suit
exactly
as
you
would
expect
keeping
nice
continuity
of
flavor
and
blend
between
everything
that
is
going
on

feel
is

really
like
the

the

would
genuinely
like
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
in

overall
very

it

a
bit
too
much
going
on
i
really
like
it
bends
the
style
a
bit
but
it
has
two
things
i
really
look
for
balance
and
easy
drinkability
well
wothy
a
try
here
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
its
kind
boont
is
a
tasty
crisp
amber
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
floral
fragrance
and
mildly
fruity
taste
in
addition
to
a
complex
malt
profile
ive
seen
it
finding
its
way
onto
more
and
more
taps
around
here
and
that
makes
me
a
happy
dude
ill
pick
it
over
most
beers
when
im
out
o
good
session
beer
i
prefer
a
maltier
profile
but
this
works
in
fact
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
the
one
12
oz
bottle
it
still
pours
beautifully
and
glows
in
its
glass
a
very
tempting
amber
color
really
tough
to
resist
has
a
nice
maltycitrusy
aroma
medium
bodied
with
a
nutty
afterthought
that
hangs
around
just
long
enough
its
an
easy
drinker
definitely
an
unchallenging
brew
but
still
worth
its
weight
in
a
pinch
i
am
glad
that
this
amber
is
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
but
it
wont
make
me
a
bigger
fan
of
the
style
and
i
think
i
almost
prefer
the
more
normal
sweeter
variety
pours
brownish
copper
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
only
leaves
a
trace
of
lace
the
nose
is
malty
and
bready
more
like
an
esb
than
a
red
the
taste
is
malt
forward
but
crisp
nonetheless
the
finish
is
dry
with
some
pleasant
hop
bitterness
i
love
this
stuff

not

glad
i

but
will
go
for
something
more

next
time
overall
great
amber
with
exceptional
balance
session
friendly
one
of
those
rare
beers
thats
approachable
enough
for
the
beginner
but
complex
enough
to
keep
an
avid
beer
fans
interest
drink
it
was
okay
nothing
special
or
fancy
might
have
been
a
bit
old
but
thats
my
fault
just
lacked
pop
and
flavor
for
me
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
lightly
carbonated
not
my
kind
of
beer
but
certainly
interesting
i
prefer
bolder
hops
to
lactose
in
my
ambers
o
an
easy
drinker
good
stuff
for
a
fairly
nondescript
style
o
very
nice
smooth
malt
ale
good
showing
for
a
red
ale
which
arent
always
my
favorite
decent
beer
tastes
better
in
the
can
than
in
a
glass
o
none
either
offending
nor
particular
inspiring
however
i
liked
the
flavor
and
what
this
beer
was
about
overall
overall
something
is
just
missing
from
this
beer
it
looks
good
after
the
pour
which
made
me
expect
so
much
more
than
what
this
beer
delivered
the
flavors
are
fleeting
almost
as
if
your
palate
has
been
cleansed
after
a
swallow
while
drinking
this
beer
is
not
unpleasant
i
find
it
easily
forgetable
a
decent
enough
amber
ale
one
that
rises
above
the
standard
riffraff
so
prevalent
across
our
two
countries
brewing
output
but
doesnt
fly
too
high
hopwise
as
this
is
no
typical
california
red
ale
icarus
easy
to
drink
then
if
wellrendered
malt
and
fruit
esters
are
your
thing
me
im
in
the
us
of
a
and
will
shortly
be
seeking
out
something
to
address
the
buildup
of
enamel
on
my
teeth
not
a
bad
amber
ale
and
also
this
has
grown
to
be
a
cult
classic
around
these
parts
but
not
necessarily
my
togo
beer
if
i
had
to
pick
one
from
a
selection
of
beers
within
this
style
has
plenty
of
flavors
going
for
it
but
needs
more
body
at
least
to
me
it
does
why
in
the
heck
have
i
never
had
this
beer
before
off
all
the
other
andersons
this
is
a
real
simple
and
easy
drinking
and
great
tasting
amber
overall
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
highly
drinkable
the
aroma
falls
well
short
bordering
on
nonexistent
however
thats
the
only
negative
i
can
offer
for
this
brew
definitely
not
the
best
anderson
valley
can
do
who
knew
they
canned
too
cool
pours
clear
redish
with
a
medium
tan
head
smells
like
redamber
malts
english
a
little
in
nature
and
almost
no
hops
or
sweetness
which
leaves
a
void
in
the
the
aroma
and
actually
in
the
taste
too
caramely
flavor
with
none
of
the
irish
dryness
but
the
same
profile
flavor
wise
feel
is
very
bubbly
maybe
overly
so
keeps
things
fizzy
and
too
light
to
let
the
flavors
shine
i
dont
know
a
pretty
average
amber
all
up
but
my
first
letdown
from
these
guys
if
it
werent
the
apocalypse
i
dont
think
id
have
had
a
second
overall
i
really
didnt
expect
the
hop
overload
in
an
amber
ale
but
it
is
wellbalanced
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
an
amber
ale
not
one
i
want
to
try
again
its
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
but
its
a
pretty
solid
amber
that
worth
your
time
o
a
very
easy
drinker
with
a
sweet
start
and
pretty
roasted
finish
a
nice
light
winter
or
spring
beer
overall
perrier
morphed
into
an
ale
this
one
was
a
gold
medal
winner
according
to
the
label
but
the
sour
mineral
water
taste
really
got
in
the
way
for
me
having
been
a
big
barney
flats
fan
i
decided
to
explore
the
brewery
more
fully
when
i
picked
up
their
12
pack
mixer
and
this
1st
one
was
definitely
a
solid
one
pours
a
clear
golden
copper
into
my
standard
bells
brewery
pint
glass
a
foamy
antique
whiteeggshell
head
of
about
34
of
an
inch
forms
and
dissipates
almost
as
quickly
leaving
lace
around
the
entire
glass
an
immediate
pleasing
mild
hint
of
citrus
that
yields
to
a
light
roasted
caramel
malt
aroma
up
front
theres
a
bit
of
a
sour
sensation
not
necessarily
taste
on
the
tip
and
underneath
the
tip
of
the
tongue
smooth
carbonation
over
the
top
of
the
tongue
but
a
little
scrubby
on
the
tongues
edges
nothing
is
overpowering
about
this
beer
but
if
there
is
a
prevalent
flavor
it
is
something
akin
to
caramel
sorghum
and
horehound
it
finishes
with
a
trace
of
pine
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
was
disappointed
by
how
this
beer
tasted
because
i
expected
something
a
little
more
based
on
what
i
had
read
otherwise
its
not
a
bad
beer
quite
drinkable
very
drinkable
and
solid
amber
ale
well
balanced
and
consistent
1
75
a
single
o
good
damn
amber
here
i
enjoyed
the
shit
out
of
it
poured
into
pint
glass
next
to
no
head
no
lacing
good
reddishorange
color
smells
of
hops
pine
and
citrus
my
initial
taste
was
almost
orangy
further
on
theres
something
thats
faintly
soapy
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
the
carbonation
is
good
though
overall
i
cant
get
over
the
soapy
taste
i
would
try
this
again
to
see
if
maybe
it
was
just
me
just
this
time
pretty
tasty
and
balanced
solid
brew
overall
very
floral
which
dominates
this
brew
basically
if
you
like
floral
beers
you
will
enjoy
this
one
overall
awesome
way
better
than
expected
so
much
better
than
expected
i
cant
even
believe
i
havent
had
this
before
pick
this
up
if
you
like
really
malty
amberstyled
colorful
ales
arated
amber
in
appearance
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
as
you
get
the
smell
of
the
malt
flavor
starts
off
good
with
a
nice
malt
intro
but
the
sweetness
just
continues
to
develop
and
by
the
middle
of
the
sip
it
is
too
overbearing
for
me
a
liquified
sugar
candy
type
flavor
sweet
finish
too
though
the
peak
of
that
sweetness
lies
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
i
tried
this
because
it
was
one
of
my
friends
favorite
beers
but
i
definitely
felt
differently
towards
it
the
taste
is
simple
and
satisfying
an
everyday
beer
good
with
food
or
without
a
very
carbonated
front
with
a
malt
flavor
lingering
on
the
top
of
the
roof
of
your
mouth
aftertaste
is
minimal
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
o
perfectly
balanced
on
the
maltshops
combination
refreshing
and
extremely
balanced
not
the
most
flavourful
or
complex
beer
out
there
so
if
you
are
in
for
bold
and
supertasty
beers
this
may
not
be
your
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
a
fine
excellent
brew
i
would
gladly
drink
it
on
regular
basis
if
us
imports
did
not
cost
so
much
the
caramel
dominates
and
the
yeast
adds
character
nice
body
and
easy
going
down
the
astringent
finish
is
the
only
flaw
a
good
drinking
amber
ale
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
reddish
highlights
ok
lacing
on
my
pint
glass
fairly
clear
in
appearance
a
good
looker
for
the
style
the
nose
is
mainly
caramel
malt
hops
and
some
sweetness
a
little
on
the
weak
side
for
me
but
still
nice
taste
profile
is
the
same
as
the
nose
but
a
little
stronger
taste
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
feel
is
fairly
light
w
minimal
carbonation
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
several
of
it
goes
down
easily
and
is
pretty
tasty
for
the
style
overall
i
would
have
this
again
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
a
solid
beer
cheers
very
similar
flavours
lots
of
nutty
and
toasty
malt
slightly
more
hoppy
than
the
aroma
again
mainly
pine
seems
lacking
after
the
initial
burst
of
flavours
though
and
a
little
watery
this
is
a
solid
beer
ive
had
it
before
and
i
remember
some
toasted
malt
notes
honestly
i
enjoy
these
notes
better
i
could
though
use
a
little
more
malt
backbone
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
what
people
need
to
focus
in
on
beers
like
this
that
no
one
has
ever
even
heard
of
but
yet
satisfy
just
as
much
if
not
more
than
any
big
labeled
beers
well
done
color
was
a
rich
amber
color
smell
of
dirty
dish
towels
and
burnt
sugar
and
malt
taste
was
burnt
wood
and
and
a
sweet
unappealing
malt
combo
the
aftertaste
was
worse
the
initial
taste
was
bad
and
stayed
with
me
even
the
next
day
after
brushing
my
teeth
and
eating
cant
help
but
wonder
if
its
a
bad
bottle
or
just
bad
product
too
cautious
to
try
again
almost
wrote
off
amber
completely
went
down
very
very
easy
delicious
sweet
earthy
but
not
too
sweet
a
great
go
to
beer
for
all
seasons
d
doesnt
really
fit
into
the
style
all
too
well
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
simple
but
its
built
well
and
easily
drinkable
o
this
style
is
so
open
to
interpretation
anything
goes
from
hoppy
to
malty
this
one
lands
more
on
the
hoppy
side
and
is
pretty
good
dr
very
drinkable
but
unremarkable
a
fairly
uninspired
amber
ale
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
amber
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
puffy
head
aroma
is
fruity
with
carmel
malts
taste
is
citruscarmel
and
spices
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
i
would
recommend
to
try
this
beer
at
least
once
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
sometime
down
the
road
final
thoughts
a
very
nice
beer
i
was
a
little
iffy
buying
it
because
i
hadnt
ever
heard
of
the
company
but
their
labels
would
have
you
believe
they
are
as
well
known
as
sam
adams
or
something
but
it
worked
out
and
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
them
again
buy
this
one
its
good
4
5
d
solid
beer
throughout
definitely
worth
an
occasional
purchase
however
they
are
dominated
by
particular
taste
watery
beer
with
nothing
except
a
slight
bitterness
comes
up
which
is
a
shame
because
it
is
fullbodied
and
easy
drinking
d
boont
amber
ale
drinks
like
a
dream
the
alcohol
hides
very
well
and
its
easy
to
get
carried
away
by
just
having
too
many
whether
thats
good
or
bad
is
left
to
the
end
user
overall
this
is
one
very
well
put
together
amber
ale
it
has
all
the
components
fitting
perfectly
into
place
nice
maltiness
to
go
with
the
pronounced
but
still
subtle
hop
flavors
a
cold
sixpack
of
this
would
not
be
more
than
welcome
at
most
social
or
antisocial
gatherings
boont
amber
ale
is
probably
my
favorite
straight
up
amber
ale
the
beer
pours
a
nice
full
amber
with
froathy
white
head
at
least
finger
plus
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
and
balance
overall
it
is
a
great
amber
ale
pours
a
pleasing
amber
color
true
to
its
name
foamy
theres
a
distinctive
and
pleasing
caramel
maltiness
to
this
is
it
the
same
malt
profile
thats
shared
across
the
boontville
family
ill
have
to
investigate
this
one
further
theres
a
hoppy
bite
on
the
finish
that
surprises
like
a
sharp
bitter
treat
t
i
have
to
admit
theres
nothing
particularly
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
it
may
just
be
my
favorite
amber
out
there
it
has
such
a
great
balance
between
the
caramel
malt
and
floral
hop
flavors
that
i
could
drink
it
all
night
overall
a
worthy
beer
in
a
can
might
be
one
of
the
better
canned
beers
made
in
the
us
these
days
rather
earthy
and
seems
a
little
murky
i
struggle
for
words
but
this
is
not
a
flavor
i
am
very
fond
of
the
scent
is
great
though
wow
im
really
suitably
unimpressed
with
this
its
cloying
sugary
and
altogether
rather
unpleasant
given
how
widespread
this
is
i
was
expecting
something
at
least
mild
and
inoffensive
but
this
genuinely
not
something
i
want
to
drink
often
if
at
all
overall
not
a
very
impressive
beer
there
are
interesting
qualities
and
rich
flavors
but
the
final
product
seems
flabby
and
uninspired
out
of
balance
out
of
whack
very
thin
body
and
carbonation
o
smooth
decent
beer
i
enjoyed
it
overall
way
too
sweet
for
me
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
maple
and
toasted
malts
i
can
see
this
as
a
solid
amber
but
it
totally
didnt
work
for
me
o
one
of
the
most
drinkable
american
amber
or
red
ales
that
i
have
had
the
reason
why
i
like
this
beer
over
others
in
the
style
is
its
subtlety
while
other
red
ales
can
be
more
acidic
this
takes
a
balanced
and
middle
of
the
road
approach
another
thursday
another
random
bottle
at
the
weekly
bliss
tasting
it
pours
a
clear
copperamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
caramel
very
light
pine
and
a
few
crumbs
of
sourdough
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
orange
rind
light
lemon
zest
light
pine
and
rye
bread
these
all
come
together
in
a
pleasant
balanced
flavor
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
overall
a
tasty
wellbalanced
brew
right
on
this
beer
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
that
said
its
still
a
nice
drink
you
can
have
a
few
on
a
night
smells
of
caramel
and
bready
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
grassy
hop
smell
as
well
it
pours
a
an
amber
body
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
behind
great
lacing
it
tastes
a
bit
bitter
upfront
followed
by
a
greart
mellow
sweet
malty
ending
its
a
bit
oily
on
the
palate
but
drinks
very
well
and
can
be
made
for
a
great
session
beer
a
great
beer
to
get
in
the
can
and
go
camping
with
overall
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
beer
either

those

amber
doesnt
quite
possess
the
body
or
strength
of
character
to
warrant
repeat
purchases
by
the
me
writing
this
beer
review
i
can
only
imagine
what
the
me
first
discovering
darker
beers
would
have
thought
six
or
seven
years
ago
chances
are
i
would
have
given
my
right
eye
for
another
this
is
a
serviceable
amber
ale
through
and
through
o
one
of
the
best
allaround
drinking
beers
available
i
go
back
to
this
beer
again
and
again
when
looking
for
something
to
go
with
my
meal
its
not
the
most
technical
beer
in
the
world
but
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
worthy
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
a
lead
off
sweetness
and
a
sweet
finish
it
is
a
malty
one
this
beer
it
is
not
cloying
but
it
is
on
the
heavier
end
of
the
spectrum
for
these
beers
tearthy
tea
like
spiciness
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
backbone
but
really
just
stops
there
i
was
expecting
something
more
up
front
but
its
fairly
mellow
not
what
i
expected
from
how
the
beer
initially
smelled
like
there
is
a
nice
fruitiness
to
the
beer
in
which
the
malts
keep
in
check
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
but
present
toward
the
end
of
your
sip
overall
good
balance
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
theses
i
saw
some
available
in
cans
as
well
might
give
that
a
try
another
northern
california
classic
good
for
any
occasion
pours
a
clouded
dark
brownishamber
a
dense
offwhite

stays
and
sticks
smell
is
sort
of
earthy
with
some
green
spices
and
a
bit
of
heat
and
bandaid
taste
is
balanced
well
overall
nicely
toasted
malted
barley
much
appreciated
finishing
hops
with
a
mineral

taste
certainly
happening
very
good
could
be
an
amber
ale
staple
for
me
overall
nice
to
try
no
to
try
again
looks
pretty
good
its
a
translucent
amber
hue
capped
with
a
soapy
offwhite
head
it
smells
average
at
best
somewhat
farmy
hay
atop
caramel
grain
with
a
faint
herbal
hop
it
tastes
good
far
better
than
the
nose
suggests
with
lots
of
caramel
maltiness
though
it
winds
up
with
a
rather
dry
flavor
for
the
profile
floral
hoppiness
is
noted
throughout
feels
smooth
and
soft
overall
it
is
good
and
drinkable
o
an
amber
with
mass
appeal
and
good
drinkability
if
i
wanted
to
buy
it
again
but
im
moving
on
3
5
drinkability
overall
a
good
beer
there
is
something
in
the
smell
and
that
i
do
not
like
that
carrys
over
just
slightly
into
the
taste
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
usually
the
best
ambers
and
reds
rating
wise
tend
to
be
very
hoppy
which
is
all
well
and
dandy
this
is
one
of
the
best
balanced
ambers
out
there
worth
having
around
a
versatile
beer
sampled
from
a
can
with
no
freshness
date
deep
red
in
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
excellent
clarity
poured
with
decent
offwhite
head
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
spotty
cap
that
left
spots
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
fresh
floral
and
wet
pine
aromas
balance
well
with
a
sweet
caramel
maltiness
smooth
and
resiny
feel
with
perfect
carbonation
flavors
are
a
nice
balance
of
floral
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malt
both
the
hop
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
seem
to
intensify
from
the
beginning
through
the
middle
and
slowly
transition
to
a
mostly
malty
finish
with
a
hint
of
fresh
wet
pine
overall
very
solid
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
2011
american
craft
beer
fest
on
june
3
2011
the
pour
was
more
deep
amber
than
red
with
a
decent
offering
of
head
there
was
a
strong
caramel
maltiness
on
the
nose
the
body
came
in
at
about
medium
and
the
taste
also
brought
out
a
vibrant
caramel
maltiness
but
it
ended
with
a
nicely
balanced
hop
finale

didnt
forsee
that
he
would

in
fact
that
is
the
greatest
irony
of
his
existence
his
father
a

his

a

and
here
he
was
advising
adolescents
of
their
future
well
you
certainly

i
call

he

under
his

even
if
he
was
the
best
at
his
job
no
one
would
notice
he
could
direct
his

but
never

is

certainly
maintained
the

slightly

finish
an
ok
beer
o
a
solid
amber
ale
with
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
descent
amber
ale
i
tend
to
like
my
ambers
more
balanced
and
this
wasnt
that
balanced
it
was
dominated
by
the
malts
and
it
didnt
let
much
hops
come
through
at
all
a
stronger
hop
kick
in
this
beer
would
help
balance
out
all
the
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
malts
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
would
choose
most
of
the
local
amber
over
this
one
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
again
it
was
pretty
expensive
for
what
it
is
if
you
like
ambers
give
this
one
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
track
it
down
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
amber
but
i
would
still
be
willing
to
see
what
other
brews
anderson
valley
is
working
with
o
one
of
the
first
ambers
that
i
tried
and
still
always
a
good
beer
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
especially
if
you
like
ones
that
are
sweet
but
not
cloying
but
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
because
it
does
feel
a
bit
filling
additional
note
as
a
beer
tasting
amateur
i
usually
analyze
a
new
beer
and
then
read
other
members
reviews
i
must
say
the
below
review
by
nickfl
vividly
and
accurately
characterizes
my
impressions
of
this
beer
i
swear
i
was
thinking
what
he
put
into
words
after
pouring
it
into
my
glass
i
was
impressed
by
the
brightness
of
the
color
and
the
activity
of
the
carbonation
which
provided
a
rich
creamy
head
this
beer
had
wonderful
aromas
of
caramel
malt
and
pine
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
extremely
full
round
and
silky
a
very
full
flavored
amber
the
balance
of
malt
and
hop
characters
is
the
best
ive
tasted
in
sometime
d
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
out
there
there
is
an
excellent
balance
between
the
citrusy
hops
and
amber
malt
such
that
both
are
full
flavored
aspects
of
the
beer
but
neither
one
every
feels
excessive
or
unbalanced
the
hop
aroma
is
particularly
nice
for
a
beer
of
this
style
and
strength
i
particularly
like
the
way
the
orange
flavors
of
the
hops
work
with
the
toffee
in
the
malt
profile
to
lend
the
beer
a
refreshing
but
substantial
quality
a
great
beer
and
well
worth
seeking
out
when
it
is
fresh
this
is
a
fine
amber
im
glad
to
see
more
anderson
valley
popping
up
in
toledo
over
all
this
was
a
very
good
beer
my
first
go
around
with
this
beer
in
2008
left
me
less
than
impressed
but
i
may
just
grab
an
other
one
of
these
overall
i
do
appreciate
more
hop
forward
ambers
but
this
beer
drinks
pretty
well
i
am
kind
of
off
put
by
this
and
glad
i
am
finishing
it
off
tonight
not
the
best
rep
of
the
style
but
not
the
worst
very
good
if
you
can
find
it
for
under
8
bucks
a
sixer
or
what
i
paid
15
for
a
case
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tunbler
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
jolly
rancher
and
hair
salon
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
nutmeg
jolly
rancher
and
wet
permed
hair
wtf
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
one
what
the
hell
was
up
with
the
hair
characteristics
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
one
i
should
have
known
not
to
drink
it
by
getting
hair
salon
in
the
aroma
but
nooo
i
had
to
do
it
anyways
blah
i
wont
be
having
this
one
again
for
sure
still
better
than
the
one
where
i
got
burnt
hair
flavors
in
it
a
hazy
red
copper
with
a
frothy
white
head
small
amount
of
head
but
thick
and
clinging
to
the
sides
a
strong
amount
of
sweetened
black
tea
in
the
nose
some
caramel
but
it
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
black
tea
smell
floral
hops
are
faintly
lingering
in
the
background
but
i
think
they
mainly
contributing
to
the
tea
aroma
a
mild
fruity
taste
of
cherries
but
also
a
great
mix
of
the
roasted
caramel
and
fruityfloral
hop
aromas
a
lightly
dry
bitterness
that
is
balanced
with
some
wet
juicy

i
have
heard
many
great
things
about
this
brewery
and
while
i
have
not
been
drinking
many
amberales
lately
this
was
a
refreshing
beer
that
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
like
on
a
camping
trip
not
the
greatest
amber
but
i
will
be
trying
more
anderson

beers
d
very
good
and

its
an
interesting
beer
with
a
number
of
layers
id
definitely
have
another
good
first
experience
from
anderson

d
decently
enjoyable
the
taste
is
good
even
if
most
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
falls
short
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
if
i
knew
it
was
fresh
for
sure

otherwise
im
in

go

nothing

but
nothing

d
this

and
is

drinkable
d
this
is
another
very
drinkable
beer
from

the

leaves
a

in

aftertaste

other
than
that
its

dwas
excited
to
try
this
beer
especially
after
smelling
it
but
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
flavors
get
lost
in

and
it
is
just
a

hoppy

overall

is
one
of
the
beers
i
drink

presents
a
fairly
handsome
walnut
amber
color
with
a
nice

head
on

the
nose
is
a
bit
plain
the
taste

some
clove

well
there
is
a
touch

is
soapy
taste
differennt
and
malty
and
not
that
appealing
it
has
malts
and
bready
biscuit
tones
the
taste
is
a
bitter
malt
not
sweet
and
not
much
in
the
hops
smell
the
taste
is
the
same
its
ok
but
not
a
nice
sweet
malt
with
some
nice
bitter
hops
followed
by
some
bready
nutty
flavors
it
just
was
not
there
think
troegs
or
bells
amber
beers
this
one
is
drinkable
and
ok
i
just
wont
buy
it
again
to
many
other
ambers
and
pales
and
ipas
to
mess
with
this
one
not
recommended
drinkability
overall
i
really
liked
this
and
would
recommend
to
friends
this
is
the
second
really
good
amber
ale
that
ive
had
in
a
week
the
deep
color
of
molasses
makes
this
brew
mouthwatering
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
between
the
mouthfeel
perfect
carbonation
and
nice
hop
immediately
makes
it
one
of
my
favorites
this
spring
the
smell
off
of
the
pint
is
slightly
sweet
but
otherwise
indescript
i
woudl
compare
this
brew
to
a
mild
apa
in
terms
of
flavor
and
drinkability
its
a
good
one
the
taste
is
smooth
slightly
oily
and
full
and
balanced
it
has
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
and
fruit
balanced
with
and
pineyflowery
hop
bitterness
with
some
general
citrus
grapefruit
being
detectable
but
only
faintly
amongst
other
fairly
wellrounded
hop
character
the
body
is
fairly
robust
and
both
it
and
the
flavour
both
hold
up
well
it
is
highly
drinkable
the
flavour
balance
and
character
holding
up
well
and
staying
smooth
throughout
overall
its
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
its
a
solid
brew
not
a
stand
out
but
solid
d
highly
drinkable
though
nothing
spectacular
as
the
review
indicates
pretty
much
everything
was
good
everything
above
average
but
nothing
particularly
excellent
still
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
d
and
it
goes
down
oh
so
easy
drinkability
boont
amber
ale
is
a
very
impressive
its
even
and
well
flavored
definitely
the
best
amber
ive
tried
d
this
is
a
good
beer
my
first
offering
from
anderson
valley
and
i
think
this
could
easily
be
enjoyed
in
a
session
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
amber
ale
the
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
is
right
on
and
the
finish
is
very
clean
d
i
really
applaud
the
restraint
in
this
ale
it
does
get
overly
hopped
for
the
style
and
i
could
have
gone
for
another
bomber
honestly
the
freshness
has
a
lot
to
do
with
my
review
i
am
sure
since
anderson
valley
beer
travels
and
sits
in
pa
whereas
this
was
sent
directly
from
ca
by
josh
thanks

over

that
could

smoothly
while
you
always
know
its
there
i
absolutetly
love
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
on
draft
in
a
bar
in
santa
cruz
it
poured
out
with
a
lot
of
head
it
had
such
a
nice
aroma
to
it
kind
of
woodsy
taste
really
smooth
caramel
nutty
just
a
bunch
of
greatness
definitely
reccommended
a
very
forward
taste
with
berry
and
vanilla
that
dissolves
into
a
mildly
smokey
caramel
that
lingers
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
be
pleasant
im
drinking
this
on
a
very
cold
winter
evening
and
am
thinking
it
would
be
superb
on
a
warm
fall
evening
decent
carbonation
but
a
times
a
bit
over
done
big
bottle
size
with
a
slightly
higher
than
average
abv
makes
this
a
borderline
session
ale
d
legendary
session
beer
overall
the
beer
has
an
astringent
and
a
moderate
carbonation
for
the
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
bitter
but
lingers
on
the
palate
for
a
few
moments
this
is
a
very
good
amber
ale
i
have
tried
a
few
others
amber
ales
but
this
one
so
far
is
one
of
the
better
one
i
like
the
balance
of
the
beers
malt
to
the
hops
the
only
thing
that
i
feel
is
it
didnt
have
head
retention

the
style

crisp

low

initial

bitterness
light

to
a
strong

is
just
right
not
watery
and
not
too
overpowering
only
complaint
would
be
that
it
is
a
touch
to
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
overall
a
really
good
beer
beer
poured

had
a
hint
of
light

becomes
mostly
malty
after
a
few
sips

is
well

the

finish
mouthfeel

light

this
is
a
well

beer

is
right
on
the
edge
of
being
sessionable
not
sure
why
it
took
so
long
to
try
this

notes
from

id
like
to
thank
avbc
for
hours
of
pleasurable
boont
amber
drinking
overall
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
d
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
amber
ale
thats
simple
and
drinkable
albeit
a
tad
thin
and
watery
overall
possibly
due
to
the
age
of
the
bottle
d
this
is
a
somewhat
easy
drinker
ambers
arent
really
my
thing
so
i
would
probably
tire
after
a
couple
but
if
you
like
them
then
youll
probably
be
able
to
enjoy
a
whole
lot
of
this
stuff
great
beer
id
love
to
hang
at
a
bar
and
drink
these
til
i
couldnt
drink
anymore
nice
smooth
taste
but
not
that
unique
if
youre
looking
for
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
this
probably
isnt
it
but
would
fit
well
with
any
mixed
variety
of
beers
if
i
saw
it
in
a
pile
id
pick
it
up
especially
impresses
withed
shape
overall
this
one
is
ok
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
a
good
but
very
typical
american
amber
worth
drinking
but
nothing
that
separates
it
from
the
crowd
t
extremely
drinkable
ridiculously
smooth
the
most
drinkable
amber
i
have
had
yet
dnice
abv
something
you
can
partake
all
night
pours
a
clouded
amber
nose
use
malty
with
some
caramel
flavor
is
wads
of
caramel
malt
on
the
backside
nice
and
thick
robust
and
lasts
for
a
while
heavy
heavy
caramel
though
real
smooth
feel
on
all
ends
nice
to
drink
well
bodied
and
consistent
a
good
one
great
gateway
beer
or
even
just
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
anytime
my
wife
and
i
loved
this
beer
when
we
lived
in
ca
and
are
glad
we
got
another
chance
to
have
this
again
overall
one
of
the
best
ambers
i
have
had
the
flavors
blend
so
well
together
and
the
caramel
flavor
is
almost
unrivaled
m
d
a
smooth
drinking
round
medium
body
just
enough
stick
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
on
the
way
down
a
very
decent
brew
this
could
potentially
become
a
staple
of
my
selection
at
some
point
d
drinks
alright
but
if
it
wasnt
so
darn
cloying
it
would
go
down
much
easier
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
it
now
this
is
an
amber
ale
for
me
nice
quality
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
leaving
trace
amounts
of
lacing
aroma
is
not
extremely
intense
but
it
is
sturdy
sweet
with
caramel
and
a
light
hop
aroma
very
enticing
fresh
and
satisfying
to
the
palate
a
real
good
feel
to
this
one
flavor
is
incredibly
balanced
tons
of
malt
in
this
one
and
just
the
right
amount
of
mild
hops
perhaps
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
ever
to
cross
my
lips
great
amber
sweet
and
yummy
a
pure
delight
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
amber
ale
and
probably
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
i
prefer
a
beer
that
tips
toward
the
malt
and
this
one
certainly
does
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
to
the
malt
and
the
hops
let
them
come
out
and
show
their
stuff
even
after
the
beer
warms
up
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
excellent
beer
and
one
i
will
have
again
i
can
see
drinking
a
couple
as
i
watch
the
patriots
this
fall
i
am
sad
to
report
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
to
try
i
will
head
back
for
more
eventually
really
smooth
and
nicely
drinkable
drinkability
one
of
the
better
ambers
ive
had
lately
a
nice
malt
backbone
balanced
by
citrus
hops
without
anything
going
out
of
control
either
way
full
delicious
highly
balanced
and
drinkable
oelergud
taste
follows
suit
burnttoasted
malts
overwhelm
the
flavor
and
finish
of
this
brew
toasted
biscuity
malts
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
just
not
quite
what
i
expected
good
drinkability
somewhat
sweet
pretty
good
stuff
overall
a
little
on
the
soft
side
in
hops
but
still
complex
enough
to
be
very
enjoyable
malt
driven
with
lots
of
sweet
fruit
flavors
with
just
enough
hops
to
provide
balance
overall
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
little
flat
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
really
liked
this
amber
ale
it
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
compared
to
the
monster
west
coast
beers
we
have
been
enjoying
over
the
past
few
years
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
easly
one
of
the
most
balanced
session
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
to
me
it
seems
not
much
more
than
a
runofthemill
amber
that
can
be
found
in
a
typical
brewpub
just
my
opinion
though
p
s
sorry
for
the
short
review
im
not
a
beer
drinking
professional
in
the
bottle
you
have
little
headlight
head
but
it
still
has
the
great
hoppy
taste
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
for
this
style
but
a
pleasant
drink
mfd
decent
session
beer
relatively
mild
but
enjoyable
a
good
standard
for
american
ambers
which
tend
to
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
down
the
pub
but
tasty
nonetheless
this
was
a
decent
amber
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
but
these
guys
did
it
right
they
also
have
a
damn
good
oatmeal
stout
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
dirty
white
head
and
great
carbonation
nose
was
citrus
slightly
hoppy
some
malts
and
even
biscuity
together
they
did
not
mesh
well
not
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
cookielike
smells
of
toasted
caramel
malt
very
little
hop
presence
in
its
aromas
nice
refreshing
wellbalanced
taste
toffee
caramel
ripe
citrus
in
the
malt
profile
with
a
nice
snapbrim
bittering
from
the
hops
toward
the
end
feels
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
but
not
overly
so
a
very
drinkable
beer
probably
the
most
drinkable
ive
had
from
this
brewery
good
hop
notes
without
overdoing
it
nice
west
coast
spin
on
a
generally
drinkable
style
thats
really
hard
to
screw
up
a
nice
solid
amber
ale
thats
generally
refreshing
and
rather
enjoyable
nothing
mindblowing
but
still
quite
solid
something
id
try
again
when
offered
the
body
is
closer
to
mid
than
full
body
quality
a
bit
chewy
with
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
some
off
flavors
limit
this
beer
recommended
not
deep
but
very
tasty
with
a
great
mouthfeel
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
session
type
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
to
serve
to
swillbeer
drinkers
who
you
are
trying
to
move
to
craft
beers
because
of
its
balance
and
the
fact
that
it
has
nothing
offensive
going
on
this
beer
has
broad
appeal
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is

slightly
murky
copperamber
color
with
a
thin
head
comprised
of
lots
of
large
bubbles
the
smell
is
slightly
malty
sweet
caramely
slightly
fruity
and
also
has
a
slight
hop
presence
the
taste
is
quite
interesting
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
the
intro
is
slightly
hoppy
but
well
balanced
with
caramel
malt
and
finishes
biscuty
and
slightly
grainy
different
is
how
i
would
have
to
describe
it
but
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
a
light
smooth
carbonation
drinkability
of
this
one
is
pretty
high
good
session
beer
not
a
particularly
pleasing
beer
but
a
novelty
anyway
d
this
is
a
very
nice
amber
beer
the
smell
was
really
surprising
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
roasted
malt
some
bread
and
midway
through
and
through
the
finish
theres
a
nice
hop
bite
that
gives
a
nice
balance
to
the
over
all
flavour
but
its
still
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
and
for
me
it
works
nicely
amberreds
that
are
tasty
enough
to
keep
me
interested
for
the
entire
session
arent
all
that
easy
to
find
for
my
palate
but
this
one
fits
the
bill
i
recommend
it
because
its
tasty
and
its
a
good
brew
to
session
pours
a
light
copper
color

in

and
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
while
drinkability
is
high
because
of
the
smoothness
of
the
finish
and
the
nice
malty
sweetness
poured
an
amber
red
with
a
decent
off

taste
is
also
of
piney
hops
with
some

coming
through
an
enjoyable
brew
which
fortunately
for
me
is
readily
available
in

california
poured
into
a

producing

bitterness
on
the

of
the
tongue
well
balanced
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
and

this
would
qualify
as
a
pleasant
session
beer
one
of
the
best
american
amber
ales
i
have
tasted
d
very
good
drinkability
nicely
carbonated

one
you
could
easily
drink
all

too
i
found
myself
picking
up
my
glass
for
another
drink
quicker
than
i
thought
if
in
the
mood
i
could
have
this
as
a
session
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
all
around
brew
ill
have
to
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
smell
at
first
is
of
mostly
hops
and
a
touch
of
caramel
like
sweetness
a
very
nice
balanced
smell
taste
is
definitely
more
malty
at
first
and
overall
tastes
nice
and
balanced
as
it
warms
the
mild
hop
flavor
dissipates
somewhat
and
becomes
more
of
a
backdrop
to
the
big
caramel
creamy
taste
definitely
changes
as
it
warms
a
bit
overall
a
good
rich
amber
drinkability
is
about
average
this
one
is
fine
but
pretty
indistinct
well
carbonated
and
very
good
mouthfeel
i
still
believe
this
one
is
among
the
best
amber
ales
out
there
d
highly
drinkable
love
the
creamy
caramel
excellant
change
of
pace
for
my
hop
heavy
rotation
the
beer
settles
in
the
glass
a
chill
hazed
orange
color
with
an
adequate
compact
head
this
is
a
nice
little
treat
in
a
glass
this
ale
leans
towards
the
malty
side
with
a
kiss
of
tealike
hops
actually
the
flavor
from
the
maltiness
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
oktoberfestbier
and
like
that
beer
this
can
be
quaffed
with
ease
despite
an
alcohol
level
thats
just
a
little
heavier
than
normal
dthe
memory
remains
the
same
great
drinking
amber
ale
with
character
and
flavor
the
aroma
was
of
honey
and
caramel
the
taste
was
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
i
thought
it
finished
nice
on
the
hop
side
which
gave
it
a
fresh
taste
you
can
taste
the
caramel
thru
the
drink
and
it
was
soft
on
the
palate
very
enjoyable
amber
boont
amber
has
for
years
been
a
fridge
staple
when
i
am
on
an
amber
kick
and
is
always
the
brew
i
try
and
emulate
when
i
make
an
amber
homebrew
a
very
good
brew
from
a
very
good
brewing
company
poured
from
the
bottle
into
tasting
glass
amberorange
in
color
1
head
which
dissapates
quickly
to
14
grapefruity
nose
with
slight
sweet
carmel
malt
pretty
faint
the
taste
is
forwardly
malty
with
slight
hoppy
bite
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
has
nice
carbonation
slighty
chewy
but
still
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
large
beers
in
a
sitting
had
in
its
bottle
at
moan
and
dove
the
drink
settled
with
a
murky
amberlike
appearance
the
smells
of
malty
spices
with
some
citrus
were
most
apparent
in
this
drink
the
ale
had
a
perfect
balance
between
citrus
flavors
and
bittersweet
flavors
it
had
a
great
carbonation
to
it
making
it
pretty
refreshing
in
general
this
one
heck
of
a
good
amber
ale
pours
a
clean
amber
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
that
consist
of
grapefruity
hops
in
the
taste
grapefruity
citrus
hops
and
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
maltiness
with
a
stickysweet
aftertaste
quite
hoppy
for
an
amber
but
nice
and
easy
final
thoughts

there
are
a
lot
of
subtle
flavors
in
this
brew
indicating
a
high
degree
of
complexity
this
is
one
that
i
would
like
to
try
at
a
variety
of
temperatures
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
some
grapes
and
raisin
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
of
grapes
and
prune
juice
i
had
to
taste
again
and
yep
i
really
did
not
like
the
flavor
mouthfeeling
is
crisp
but
does
not
make
up
for
the
flavor
i
have
no
idea
what
was
going
on
with
this
one
surprisingly
good
red
ale
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
color
with
a
nice
size
off
white
head
the
head
shrinks
down
to
a
covering
of
the
top
of
the
glass
lacing
is
fairly
thick
aroma
is
fairly
pronounced
gives
an
indication
of
a
hops
malt
balance
taste
is
very
good
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
malts
caramel
and
celebration
ale
style
resinpine
hops
the
hops
flavor
is
stronger
but
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
a
nicely
balanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
rich
enough
a
touch
of
celebration
ale
style
resin
oiliness
but
nothing
as
pronounced
as
a
good
west
coast
ipa
this
is
a
well
balance
for
a
hophead
crisp
and
tasty
beer
just
right
as
a
session
beer
and
more
than
worthy
to
be
savored
for
its
own
sake
out
on
my
deck
a
very
nice
take
on
amber
ale
overall
a
very
good
amber
ale
and
definitely
worth
trying
not
my
favorite
but
if
someone
said
it
was
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
quite
drinkable
i
love
bells
dont
get
me
wrong
but
teir
amber
ale
like
many
others
is
very
grassy
and
tangy
with
the
hops
the
extremely
sweet
malts
balance
this
out
like
no
other
amber
ale
ive
had
in
a
while
delicious
served
a
mostly
crisp
amber
with
a
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
burnt
caramel
and
earthy
pine
hops
the
taste
was
an
interesting
blend
of
sweet
and
caramel
malts
with
some
underlying
citrus
hops
the
beer
was
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
would
likely
almost
always
pass
it
for
something
else
its
just
not
the
same
out
of
the
bottle
which
is
a
shame
very
drinkable
beinmg
that
i
drank
two
and
half
beers
worth
with
no
problems
d
i
didnt
dig
this
beers
balance
and
that
made
it
especially
difficult
for
me
to
drink
for
a
style
that
should
be
an
easy
session
beer
this
looks
like
a
great
beer
excellent
head
and
head
retention
deep
amber
body
but
not
too
dark
the
aroma
is
pretty
standard
for
an
amber
ale
medium
malt
background
with
a
jumble
of
american
hop
aromas
mostly
floral
the
taste
has
a
malt
background
that
is
a
little
exaggerated
by
crystal
malt
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
one
of
my
first
homebrews
in
this
way
there
isnt
so
much
depth
in
maltiness
but
more
of
one
layer
of
crystal
malt
underneath
the
pale
malt
base
making
the
caramel
seem
a
little
unnatural
the
hops
lack
distinction
but
are
nice
if
you
like
a
thick
bitterness
in
your
drink
its
hard
to
make
it
through
a
hole
pint
of
this
and
i
wont
be
ordering
it
again
for
beer
thats
supposed
to
be
fairly
drinkable
i
think
theres
a
slight
lack
of
balance
smooth
and
very
drinkable
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
american
amber
but
not
a
brilliant
one
it
pours
a
decent
copperamber
color
with
a
modest
head
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
right
after
the
pour
but
becomes
quite
a
bit
more
malty
as
it
warms
almost
bready
and
grainy
initially
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
very
hoppy
caramel
beer
but
as
things
settled
i
was
deceived
a
bit
this
is
a
beer
which
is
better
after
it
sits
a
little
while
i
tasted
too
much
hoppy
bite
too
much
oxidation
and
an
overall
imbalance
right
out
of
the
bottle
as
the
beer
settled
its
caramel
malty
balanced
characteristic
arises
and
the
warming
bread
like
notes
became
more
pronounced
this
is
a
medium
bodied
slightly
carbonated
ale
that
is
quite
drinkable
and
not
overly
strong
for
its
5
8
abv
my
suggestion
is
to
be
patient
with
this
beer
and
it
will
insinuate
itself
in
your
good
graces
the
mouthfeel
is
modest
and
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
but
just
enough
to
keep
it
honest
lchaim
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
perfect
sessionability
everything
is
smooth
creamy
clean
and
excellently
crafted
next
time
im
in
hudson
this
will
be
coming
back
with
me
d
a
good
beer
from
anderson
valley
not
my
favorite
beer
from
them
but
a
workable
brew
an
above
average
american
amber
the
beer
is
a
little
to
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
but
certainly
is
a
nice
little
complex
number
that
i
will
be
sure
to
enjoy
from
time
to
time
again
the
texture
is
a
really
nice
thickness
not
filmy
or
chewy
its
a
perfect
thirstquencher
but
also
is
a
bit
dry
feels
very
english
to
me
this
is
what
an
amber
should
be
balanced
and
thick
for
crying
out
loud
bring
me
more
d
a
nice
pleasant
easy
drinking
amber
expected
a
little
more
on
the
flavor
but
still
a
nice
easy
drinker
pours
a
pretty
amber
hue
with
deep
golden
highlights
topped
by
a
small
crown
of
creamy
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
light
fruit
and
just
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
palate
is
smooth
and
staightforward
caramel
and
a
touch
of
pale
malts
balanced
nicely
by
some
mellow
fruity
hops
smooth
finish
leaves
a
taste
of
sweet
mellow
malt
after
the
swallow
body
is
a
touch
creamy
and
just
about
perfect
for
the
flavors
that
are
imparted
an
excellent
easydrinking
amber
ale
d
a
pleasant
departure
from
the
boring
reds
around
these
days
a
really
nice
offering
in
this
beer
style
unique
and
very
drinkable
i
had
it
on
tap
on
523
and
its
even
better
i
had
a
beer
menu
of
about
30
choices
in
front
of
me
and
i
went
back
to
boont
amber
for
a
second
pint
12
oz
bottle
color
of
dark
amber
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
nose
of
hops
spruce
resin
toasty
and
malt
chocolate

taste
of
malt
lightly
hopped
toasted
and
sweet
body
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
definitely
on
the
dry
side
most
american
ambers
are
sweeter
chocolatier
doughier
a
great
example
of
integration
yummy
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
really
did
not
have
an
aroma
was
not
too
bitter
and
definitely
not
sweet
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
time
it
was
dispensed
by
a
bartender
and
the
glass
immediately
fogged
over
so
there
was
no
head
to
review
and
it
was
hard
to
determine
clarity
but
it
tasted
great
have
revisited
this
since
a
bit
too
toffeeish
and
sweetish
tastes
hoppier
than
the
fragrance
puts
on
not
really
much
going
on
somewhat
forgettable
moutfeel
is
juicy
as
a
mandarin
orange
with
decent
carbonation
levels
a
smooth
finish
and
almost
no
aftertse
bottom
line
it
goes
down
smooth
and
drinks
easily
but
not
much
here
in
the
way
of
complexity
and
taste
this
is
one
of
the
best
ambers
ive
had
that
doesnt
rely
on
an
over
the
top
hops
profile
for
the
style
its
is
drinkable
yet
still
has
a
nice
rich
caramel
flavor
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
just
a
single
of
this
not
your
average
amber
it
reminds
me
of
a
nice
dark
lager
i
wonder
if
a
decoction
was
maybe
used
for
the
malt
profile
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
balanced
slightly
sweet
floral
flavor
its
not
too
strong
and
makes
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
meal
pours
darkmedium
amber
with
bubbly
goldenwhite
head
thick
to
medium
lacing
toasty
malt
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
pineapple
undertone
of
hops
medium
body
with
a
nice
warm
round
mouthfeel
floral
and
citrus
flavors
followed
by
toasty
nutty
malts
good
balance
with
mild
hoppiness
accentuated
by
light
citrus
and
wood
undertones
throughout
a
bit
sour
hints
of
caramel
buttery
mildly
spicy
finish
with
just
the
right
touch
of
graininess
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
drinkability
very
good
for
the
style
maybe
just
a
tad
heavy
but
its
got
a
nice
complexity
for
an
amber
im
not
much
into
ambers
but
this
one
is
pretty
nice
verdict
pretty
good
a
friend
talked
it
up
before
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
does
deviate
from
the
style
a
bit
it
was
a
lot
like
an
alt
as
feloniousmonk
commented
i
had
my
suspicions
going
in
to
this
beer
that
it
was
going
to
be
rotten
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
dont
think
this
was
the
best
bottle
of
this
beer
i
could
have
grabbed
but
all
things
aside
it
faired
rather
well
and
was
pretty
decent
this
beer
looks
great
and
smells
very
good
but
the
drying
astringency
didnt
leave
such
a
good
impression
i
would
bet
that
it
would
show
better
paired
with
food
however
pours
a
very
reddish
amber
with
a
substantial
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
to
a
ring
nutty
malts
on
the
nose
along
with
some
metallic
hops
and
hints
of
oranges
on
the
palate
those
nutty
malts
come
up
first
followed
by
solid
hop
bitterness
before
turning
a
bit
fruitysweet
oranges
again
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
full
for
the
style
with
some
dextrine
characteristics
and
bracing
carbonation
quite
drinkable
but
a
touch
filling
for
the
style
still
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
that
provides
a
nicely
balanced
drinking
experience
that
both
a
malt
monster
and
a
hop
head
can
enjoy
a
solid
amber
ale
from
anderson
valley
its
a
wonderful
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
easier
access
to
this
beer
as
its
easy
to
throw
back
and
probably
the
best
amber
ale
ive
ever
had
give
this
one
a
try
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pretty
nice
amber
with
good
fluffy
head
stringy
lacing
pretty
good
a
kind
of
mild
mannered
nose
mildly
hopped
tastes
almost
a
little
too
hoppy
for
what
i
know
of
ambers
but
whatev
it
hosts
that
nice
load
of
hops
decent
malt
overall
pretty
decent
ya
but
hardly
one
to
brag
about
drinkability
wonderful
substantive
refreshment
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
ribeye
despite
not
being
top
notch
theres
certainly
enough
flavor
depth
and
alcohol
in
this
beer
to
have
several
rounds
overall
damn
this
was
good
anderson
valley
is
1
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
yet
another
good
offering
from
them
d
interesting
that
quite
a
few
of
the
anderson
valley
beers
have
some
of
the
same
characteristics
this
beer
wasnt
bad
d
above
average
but
id
grab
numerous
other
ambers
before
id
grab
this
one
again
d
sessionable
without
a
doubt
awesome
balance
count
me
in
for
another
couple
rounds
of
this
one
notes
a
pretty
thick
amber
that
i
liked
its
a
testimant
to
the
brewery
that
they
can
pull
this
offering
off
without
a
hitch
not
the
style
so
much
as
their
take
on
it
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
color
and
taste
of
this
beer
i
knew
not
to
expect
a
normal
amber
ale
from
anderson
valley
but
this
goes
way
beyond
the
norm
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
little
head
smell
is
predominantly
of
mild
hops
and
golden
malt
taste
is
great
again
its
the
hops
that
start
off
the
big
taste
but
the
malt
is
definitely
what
lingers
in
the
back
there
is
a
slight
burnt
taste
the
amazing
thing
is
the
big
amount
of
tastes
that
are
balanced
in
the
beer
overall
good
and
drinkable
beer
im
starting
to
see
these
guys
more
and
more
in
my
local
liquor
stores
which
is
nice
to
have
the
new
options
drinks
too
easy
this
is
an
amber
you
can
sink
your
teeth
into
at
damn
near
9
25
a
sixer
a
bit
pricey
excellent
worth
seeking
out
very
unique
in
its
maltiness
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
definitely
one
to
have
again
and
also
recommended
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
moderate
head
very
good
lacing
smell
is
very
sour
and
rancid
like
rotting
fruit
or
the
vacuum
cleaner
when
you
havent
changed
the
bag
in
years
i
dont
know
if
the
tap
line
was
dirty
or
the
keg
old
id
expect
a
place
like
linwood
would
keep
extremely
fresh
beer
taste
was
slightly
sweet
malty
and
fruity
pretty
flavorful
but
not
too
complex
it
was
pretty
average
not
the
best
amber
ive
had
id
like
to
try
it
again
in
bottle
form
as
the
freshness
of
the
beer
might
have
been
in
doubt
this
is
a
super
enjoyable
beer
pleasant
wellrounded
and
highly
sessionable
fairly
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
that
i
bought
a
single
to
just
try
dont
consider
this
style
one
of
my
favorites
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
really
worth
a
try
spicy
and
active
on
the
tip
of
the
tounge
this
medium
bodied
brew
holds
is
carbonation
through
the
finish
making
it
some
what
reminicent
of
a
cider
a
very
solid
beer
easy
drinking
but
may
taste
even
better
paired
with
a
good
meal
or
some
sharp
chedder
cheese
drinkability
fine
flavor
with
splendid
balance
a
pleasure
to
consume
and
quite
refreshing
i
would
welcome
another
overall
impression
solid
example
of
an
american
amber
drinkable
and
smooth
all
in
all
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
from
a
very
good
brewery
redcopper
in
color
and
clear
nice
frothy
head
dissipates
but
doesnt
disappear
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
fresh
dough
and
some
fruity
sweetness
medium
to
full
bodied
and
nice
and
creamy
wellbalanced
toffee
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
hop
crisping
very
nice
amber
ale
poured
a
medium
copper
color
with
sparse
tannish
head
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
loaded
with
malt
with
some
mild
citrus
notes
also
present
taste
starts
off
very
fruity
sweet
with
some
nice
citrus
lemon
tastes
also
showing
through
finish
is
a
bit
too
dry
to
compete
nicely
with
all
the
malt
sweetness
all
around
a
good
beer
but
not
great
delicious
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
another
excellent
beer
from
the
folks
at
anderson
valley
brewing
one
of
my
favorite
american
ambers
this
is
my
second
beer
from
anderson
valley
and
a
great
example
of
an
amber
ale
keep
up
the
great
work
pours
a
lightly
ambered
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
coat
over
top
a
solid
cascade
of
bubbles
boil
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
maintaining
the
head
nose
is
nice
and
sweet
loads
of
caramel
with
a
lighter
orangey
hop
and
mild
toastyness
smells
nice
flavor
hits
with
caramel
malt
immediately
followed
by
a
peppery
hop
moving
towards
a
light
orange
citrusyness
and
very
mild
toastyness
on
the
finish
what
amazes
me
about
this
one
is
that
it
drys
the
sides
of
my
tongue
out
really
bad
it
leaves
just
a
hint
of
residual
bitter
after
swallowing
the
beer
as
well
feel
is
solid
at
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
pretty
well
where
i
wanted
to
find
the
feel
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
flavorful
but
nothing
too
big
to
dominate
i
like
the
caramel
quality
this
one
shows
a
lot
feel
keeps
it
something
i
can
drink
not
just
sip
a
solid
amber
ale
all
in
all
a
great
beer
only
drawback
is
the
price
this
was
very
enjoyable
to
drink
even
though
i
dont
partake
in
this
style
very
often
not
a
lot
of
of
depth
here
but
whats
present
works
well
and
this
would
be
great
for
most
types
of
tastes
additonally
it
has
the
richness
of
a
fall
brew
with
the
warming
power
of
a
winter
beer
it
balances
both
those
traits
well
and
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
pours
deep

from
start
to

the
malts

carmels
are
very
evidentbut
not
overwhelming
nice
balance
i
recommend
this
beer
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
to
me
amber
ales
are
always
sort
of
questionable
as
to
how
they
will
taste
i
have
had
so
many
that
they
range
from
too
hoppy
and
bitter
to
too
malty
and
sweet
this
one
does
a
helluva
good
balancing
act
this
was
the
beer
that
turned
me
on
to
craft
beers
a
few
years
ago
drinkability
with
a
light
body
and
a
relatively
complex
malt
profile
i
could
definitely
take
a
few
pints
of
boont
especially
served
a
bit
too
cold
on
a
warm
afternoon
but
the
prominence
of
the
crystalmalt
sweetness
keep
this
from
being
a
truly
perfect
session
beer
this
has
a
more
pronounced
hop
character
than
many
american
examples
of
the
style
the
hop
bitterness
is
a
major
player
but
there
is
great
deal
of
floral
and
spicy
complexity
accompanying
it
not
that
the
malt
character
isnt
a
major
player
tooa
great
deal
of
complexity
here
too
basically
what
im
trying
to
say
is
that
it
is
both
wellbalanced
and
complex
damn
tasty
too
drinkability
this
is
a
relaxing
beer
good
feel
no
lingering
aftertaste
a
decent
amber
but
it
isnt
anderson
valleys
best
brew
in
my
opinion
still
recommended
drinkability
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
amber
ales
but
this
one
was
pretty
drinkable
maybe
on
the
session
borderline
gets
pretty
good
ratings
so
all
those
people
cant
be
wrong
as
a
side
note
purchased
this
one
since
this
years
winter
solstice
was
so
yummy
looks
like
i
need
to
try
some
more
avbc
the
body
is
appropriate
medium
in
structure
with
a
lowend
carbonation
this
has
some
promise
upfront
but
is
lead
astray
with
a
variety
of
tailing
chaos

sparing

i
think
that
this

has

not

well
worth

my
impression
of
an
amber
ale
is
that
of
a
weak
brown
ale
nevertheless
this
one
pretty
safe
looks
nicely
of
a

with
some
copper
hues
big
bubbles
and
nice

aromatic
on

very
light

a

quite
drinkable
this

really

into
a
deep
and
clear
amber
this
is
essentially
what
i
want
my
amber
ale
to
look
like
the
flavor
is
a
simple
but
rich
maltiness
with
a
really
nice
full
body
just
enough
of
a
hint
of
hops
to
be
allowed
to
come
from
a
good
west
coast
brewery
my
own
house
beer
for
a
long
time
its
easy
on
the
palate
and
the
wallet
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
very
nice
american
amber
here
pours
a
very
dark
copper
with
lazy
head
smell
is
strong
of
caramel
and
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
with
more
caramel
notes
and
not
a
trace
of
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
with
not
too
much
carbonation
very
smooth
very
drinkable
a
wonderful
session
brew
poured
a
copperred
color
with
a
white
head
plenty
of
cascade
from
the
grolwer
purchased
at
half
time
the
nose
was
slight
floral
hops
and
fruity
flavors
with
a
little
biscuity
backdrop
the
taste
was
malty
very
full
bodied
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
beer
i
could
easily
quaff
on
a
drizzley
day
such
as
this
one
but
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
just
solid
which
is
what
a
prominent
beer
like
this
should
be
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
oily
and
chewy
theres
a
definite
murky
quality
to
this
brew
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
off
overall
here
that
said
its
still
a
decent
brew
and
shouldnt
be
something
that
should
scare
you
away
from
it
its
just
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
overall
a
clean
copperamber
beer
has
a
big
thick
beige
head
that
makes
some
lace
there
is
a
very
light
sweetness
to
the
aroma
that
hints
at
malt
there
is
a
light
earthy
maltiness
with
hints
of
roasty
malt
in
the
background
in
the
flavor
followed
by
a
light
hop
snap
on
the
finish
this
beer
poured
up
a
deep
amber
color
i
big
tan
head
was
generated
but
faded
quickly
and
laced
the
glass
the
nose
is
subtle
and
slightly
sweet
the
taste
of
mild
caramel
and
is
really
smooth
not
much
of
an
after
taste
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
anderson
valley
i
would
definetly
recommend
it
better
in
cool
weather
this
beer
is
smooth
and
sits
well
in
the
mouth
definite
citrus
in
there
particularly
orange
but
not
syrupy
sweet
at
all
also
some
nuttiness
in
there
too
the
malt
is
kicks
in
just
enough
to
keep
it
wet
and
smooth
in
your
mouth
it
slides
down
your
throat
easily
and
your
mouth
asks
for
more
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
higher
alcohol
content
but
a
few
of
these
can
go
down
quickly
and
start
kicking
in
before
you
know
it
a
good
example
of
the
style
that
also
has
its
own
personnality
maybe
not
extremely
drinkable
but
definitely
enjoyable
poured
with
one
finger
of
head
into
my
pint
glass
dissipated
to
a
thin
ring
minimal
to
no
lacing
average
carbonation
caramel
taste
that
finishes
in
my
mouth
with
low
bitterness
very
smooth
to
drink
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
in
a
sitting
without
even
noticing
for
the
amber
ale
style
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
smooth
beer
perfect
example
of
why
i
should
try
more
american
amberred
ales
pours
a
translucent
reddish
brown
with
a
yellowish
white
head
strong
malty
aroma
well
balanced
with
a
rich
malty
front
and
just
enough
american
hops
to
balance
there
is
some
fruit
flavor
as
well
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
simple
and
straightforward
but
good
highly
drinkable
good
american
amber
ale
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
an
altbier
i
think
this
is
a
nice
brew
i
would
hesitate
big
time
in
calling
it
an
amber
ale
what
the
hell
is
an
amber
ale
anyway
but
it
has
a
nice
malt
to
hop
profile
and
i
enjoyed
it
this
amber
is
a
nice
session
ale
starts
off
with
a
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
most
of
the
pint
the
beer
is
amber
with
a
lot
of
light
flickering
through
smell
is
quite
mild
with
some
biscuity
notes
poking
through
taste
is
very
straightforward
the
malt
profile
is
very
simple
and
refreshing
hops
are
quite
thin
although
i
detected
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
overall
a
great
amber
drinkability
very
much
maltier
and
certainly
much
milder
than
i
expected
especially
given
the
tastebudscorching
enamelpeeling
hop
monster
that
is
their
hop
ottin
its
very
drinkable
but
aside
from
the
terrific
appearance
its
not
especially
compelling
for
a
session
west
coast
ale
id
definitely
look
to
red
nectar
or
sierra
nevada
before
this
man
i
love
this
beer
tapedinborough
castle
san
fransisco
im
a
big
fan
of
anderson
valley
and
this
is
a
good
amber
nutty
with
some
the
usual
hit
of
nw
hops
something
i
could
imagine
drinking
a
lot
of
in
one
session
quite
a
nice
amber
ale
from
a
pretty
good
brewery
a
slightly
above
average
beer
pours
a
standard
amber
color
head
is
very
light
but
present
throughout
smell
is
malty
nothing
unusual
taste
is
unusual
compared
to
most
ambers
that
ive
had
its
light
but
has
a
definite
tang
to
it
that
feels
odd
almost
sugarysweet
malt
profile
on
the
first
sip
hops
are
secondary
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
i
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
still
a
decent
amber
i
had
this
on
tap
today
and
the
color
was
deep
amber
to
mahogany
there
was
just
a
slight
head
and
little
lace
this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
was
one
of
the
1st
pours
off
the
line
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
and
a
subtle
sweetness
that
reminded
me
of
caramel
corn
cracker
jack
the
taste
had
the
malt
roasted
and
otherwise
up
front
the
hops
show
themselves
in
the
middle
and
balance
the
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
taste
is
a
yeasty
bread
flavor
wheat
bread
nice
medium
heavy
mouth
feel
and
a
wonderful
drinkability
brown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
beer
excels
all
told
this
is
a
drinkable
amber
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
anderson
valley
im
not
a
session
drinker
but
my
reaction
on
finishing
this
amber
ale
was
to
wonder
what
the
next
one
would
taste
like
now
that
my
tongue
had
adjusted
to
the
flavors
would
the
cold
bring
out
the
grapefruit
hoppy
flavors
again
or
would
my
adjusted
palette
respond
to
the
malt
notes
contrary
to
my
first
impressions
this
is
not
a
sweet
ale
at
all
it
just
has
some
very
interesting
notes
that
are
so
reminiscent
of
fruit
that
it
gets
remembered
as
sweet
im
looking
for
my
next
bottle
and
may
serve
it
at
a
warmer
temperature
to
start
with
to
see
how
that
affects
the
flavors
boont
amber
ale
is
another
goodun
from
anderson
valley
while
not
stupendous
it
is
solid
across
the
board
and
earns
my
seal
of
approval
come
to
think
of
it
maybe
those
flaky
floaters
were
boont
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
off
white
head
that
is
feed
by
lots
of
rising
bubbles
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
hops
a
little
light
in
aroma
tastes
of
crystal
malt
you
get
the
carmel
flavor
along
with
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
with
a
light
hop
bite
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
good
drinkable
little
amber
ale
not
one
of
the
best
but
not
a
bad
little
sessions
brew
wyll
an
all
around
good
beer
i
like
this
one
an
unexpected
surprise
from
a
brewery
i
had
never
heard
of
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
slight
malty
scent
with
the
presence
of
hops
and
fruity
yeast
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
light
caramel
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
metallic
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
amber
ale
it
says
its
a
gold
medal
winner
but
ive
had
much
better
it
drinks
well
but
nothing
special
saw
that
this
beer
took
home
the
silver

this
is
now
the
4th
or
5th
beer
that
i
have
had
from
anderson
valley
and
they
are
quickly
developing
great
respect
from
me
for
the
excellent
high
quality
range
of
beers
they
produce
they
seem
to
do
no
wrong
no
wonder
these
beers
win
awards
they
must
be
truly
brewed
by
a
drinker
deep
amber
coloring
no
head
due
to
the
way
the
bartender
poured
it
aromas
of
caramel
malts
and
citrusy
hops
those
aromas
are
reflected
in
the
taste
which
features
an
outstanding
balance
of
caramelbrown
sugary
malts
and
grapefruity
hops
has
to
be
one
of
the
top
american

some

and
there
a

some

on

the
taste
consists
of
a
primary
element
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
secondary
elements
toasted

spicy
grain
and
some
hops
to
balance
the
nice

load
the

this

i
have
had
this
beer
on
both
tap
and
in
the
bottle
this
review
is
of
the
bottle
since
i
had
it
more
recently
i
love
avbc
so
what
is
there
not
to
love
about
this
one
just
the
right
balance
of
fuit
of
bitterness
on
this
ale
its
not
overpowering
at
all
but
has
enough
assertivness
to
make
it
stand
out
i
think
a
great
summer
beer
to
drink
by
the
grill
handsome
reddish
amber
color
with
full
delicate

wonderful
malty
caramel
aroma
with
light
hop
spiciness
and
flowers
quite
tasty
although
slightly
lacking
in
complexity
in
the
mouth
draws
out
to
an
excellent
crisp
finish
well
balanced
for
the
most
part
strong
attack
based
on
the
terrific
aroma
the
middle
is
a
bit
bland
but
the
finish
evens
it
out
maybe
more
hops
right
off
the
bat
mouthfeel
a
little
watery

such

the

tang
is
also
very
good

balances
the
taste
in
an
admirable
way
maltier
than
i
expected
very
well
done
the
anderson
valley
brewmasters
scored
on
this
one
with
free
throws
to
follow
lots
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
for
the
style
deep
amber
color
with
solid

lacing
is
above
average
a
little
smoother
than
other
domestics
of

that
is

this
poured
it
from
a

in
my
glass
at
home
a
nice
rich
copper
clear
look
with
a
off
white
nice
head
carbonation
is
low
which
is
fine

slight

stays
with
the
taste

a
hint
of

for
a
subtle
nice
combination

feel
the
foam
head
holds
up
well
and
provides
nice
lacing
bought
it
with
a
mix
and
match
six
pack
and
will
buy
again
this
beer
had
too
light
of
a
feel
for
me
nice
smell
of
hops
but
lacked
the
taste
to
back
it
up
overall
a
decent
amber
here
but
some
things
about
it
rub
me
the
wrong
way
the
carbonation
seems
a
bit
too
high
and
effervescent
and
the
high
bitterness
level
doesnt
really
seem
to
jive
all
that
well
with
the
overall
taste
not
bad
but
not
great
either
not
strong
enough
to
be
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
tasted
a
little
too
raw
the
color
is
the
best
part

wanted

coming

overall
decent

not

might

hard

theres

its

for
the

moderate
carbonation
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
one
that
i
dont
frequently
drink
but
should
explore
a

more
nothing
cries
beer
snob
more
than
being
forced
to
justify
an

with
a
review
what
a
terrible
new
feature
for
this
website
overall
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
amber
ales
not
to
say
that
i
dislike
them
but
they
are
not
a
style
that
i
seek
out
theyve
always
been
the
maltier
little
brother
to
pale
ales
to
me
with
that
being
said
i
am
trying
to
appreciate
them
and
i
actually
found
myself
enjoying
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
others
to
put
this
one
into
context
but
id
say
this
is
quite
tasty

may
not

it

theres

pretty

wouldnt
mind
to
find
it

thats
out

unfortunately
not

fluid
and

not
a
bad
beer
at
all
doesnt
taste
like
an
ale
more
like
an
amber
lager
the
caramel
malts
were
a
little
overwhelming
for
me
even
considering
an
amber
ale
this
is
one
i
will
seek
out
again
and
i
would
put
this
at
the
top
of
the
amber
style
nice
beer
i
was
expecting
more
hoppiness
coming
from
ballast
point
despite
the
lack
of
hops
this
beer
still
has
lots
of
flavor
there
is
a
subtle
bitterness
to
the
beer
but
that
really
allows
the
malt
flavors
to
come
through
the
most
noticeable
while
not
overpowering
was
the
roast
malt
flavor
giving
the
beer
a
nice
mellow
subtle
coffee
flavor
very
nice
mouth
feel
to
the
beer
it
was
very
light
but
it
still
had
a
creamy
aspect
to
the
beer
the
aroma
was
very
mellow
but
at
a
restaurant
i
always
have
a
hard
time
smelling
my
beer
you
can
taste
the
quality
but
the
sweetness
in
the
nose
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
ill
bet
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
like
this
one
but
it
isnt
for
me
note
to
self
rated
89
american
amber
red
ale
when
i
tasted
it
o
this
is
far
from
the
simple
amber
ales
that
flooded
the
market
in
the
early
days
of
craft
at
its
heart
it
is
really
more
of
an
english
esb
and
a
wellmade
one
at
that
its
generously
hopped
in
the
american
fashion
too
worth
a
look
if
youre
into
esbs
or
want
a
change
of
pace
dont
just
write
it
off
as
another
boring
amber
ale
a
style
of
beer
that
all
too
often
does
very
little
to
nothing
for
me
but
this
one
is
something
different
and
something
special
leave
it
to
ballast
point
for
that
the
color
is
great
largely
clear
with
an
almost
ruby
red
amber
color
and
a
khaki
head
thick
and
frothy
and
slowly
fading
but
it
leaves
spiderweb
lacing
as
it
drinks
the
nose
is
hoppy
and
dry
the
exact
opposite
of
what
we
usually
get
in
these
beers
the
hops
have
a
subtle
perfume
character
bright
and
floral
a
little
tangy
citrus
peel
clean
though
only
bitter
enough
to
balance
these
richer
grains
out
a
little
bit
is
love
to
know
which
hops
they
used
here
its
so
different
and
for
once
the
red
malt
base
enhances
hops
for
me
rather
than
crowds
them
out
with
sweetness
its
super
dry
too
and
at
a
low
abv
this
is
something
i
could
drink
endlessly
wishing
my
single
would
morph
into
a
sixer
pretty
hard
right
now
one
of
the
driest
reds
i
can
recall
and
one
of
the
most
beautifully
hopped
this
is
top
tier
for
the
style
no
doubt
its
exactly
what
my
palate
likes
beautiful
deep
amber
color
excellent
head
retention
aroma
is
dominated
by
toasty
and
fruity
specialty
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
pine
flavor
follows
suit
but
adding
a
fairly
bitter
finish
well
balanced
with
notes
of
toffee
and
citrus
countering
though
the
finish
is
more
bitter
than
id
prefer
really
wish
i
had
purchased
more
of
these
fairly
complex
for
an
amber
i
just
love
to
pop
the
cap
and
start
an
inverted
glug
following
a
pseudocascade
anything
could
happen
including
overflow
which
is
what
really
set

off

tastes
although
its
labeled
as
an

this
seems

to
an

of

its
a

ambercolored
ale
with
a

fans

might
not

for
this
i
find
it

wish
i

it
really
is
just
stamp
the

on

fer
cryyi
dont
make
us
do

with
what
turns
out
to
be

drinkability
this
amber
ale
is
okay
one
and
done
o
a
good
beer
definitely
might
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
soon
i
love
the
ipacrossenglish
bitter
style
overall
an
exemplary
example
of
the
style
absolutely
worth
revisiting
o
amazing
take
on
the
style
o
not
a
bad
selection
its
a
boston
lager
with
more
hops
quite
a
nice
flavorful
beer
thats
full
of
malt
caramel
and
hops
solid
b
o
its
no
sculpin
but
an
enjoyable
beer
none
the
less
o
remarkable
flavor
for
style
recommended
another
solid
brew
from
ballast
point
it
pours
a
beautiful
rich
amber
color
with
modest
head
the
beer
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
there
is
a
strong
caramel
malt
presence
with
a
hop
bitterness
that
is
reminiscent
of
bitter
citrus
overall
i
cannot
say
this
is
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
had
but
it
is
certainly
one
id
grab
again
o
above
average
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
flavors
are
reserved
calico
amber
ale
has
a
great
deep
amber
hue
however
with
my
experience
it
is
a
bit
lacking
as
far
as
a
nice
sudsy
head
is
concerned
it
is
adequately
carbonated
and
has
good
clarity
though
aroma
is
fresh
with
sugary
citrus
fruit
molasses
and
biscuity
notes
the
flavor
is
very
malt
forward
which
suits
the
style
however
it
may
be
a
just
a
tiny
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastebuds
it
is
somewhat
bold
and
has
moderately
heavy
body
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
very
full
and
the
finish
has
some
desirable
bitterness
to
it
and
it
lingers
nicely
while
i
dont
normally
reach
for
amber
ales
on
the
store
shelf
all
things
considered
this
is
an
excellent
beer
a
well
rounded
american
style
amber
that
i
would
surely
have
again
the
verdict
not
bad
they
call
it
an
esb
inspired
ale
which
is
pretty
much
on
the
money
more
esb
than
amber
and
a
good
quality
one
at
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
an
odd
hop
bitterness
that
i
wasnt
expecting
american
hops
that
offer
a
crisp
bitterness
and
unique
floral
aroma
i
got
some
toffee
but
not
much
of
a
caramel
taste
which
is
usually
the
case
with
most
amber
ales
i
do
get
some
vegetable
feel
from
this
beer
as
well
all
and
an
ok
beer
under
delivered
to
my
expectation
refreshing
bitter
and
tasty
beer
just
love
this
style
perfectly
balanced
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
is
this
and
american
amber
ale
or
an
esb
with
an
american
twist
two
very
compatible
styles
anyway
i
guess
i
originally
mistook
this
for
bigeye
one
of
their
ipas
but
once
i
got
it
home
i
realized
i
hadnt
tried
it
yet
twas
a
good
mistake
to
make
another
tasty
one
from
ballast
point
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
brew
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
soon
solid
drinking
ale
o
easy
to
drink
and
nice
flavors
taste
was
a
different
story
as
it
had
a
nice
little
bit
of
orange
rind
bitterness
to
it
and
a
very
smooth
malty
body
creamy
feel
from
the
nitro
somewhat
substantial
overall
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
id
buy
this
for
a
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
if
i
could
get
it
this
beer
had
a
nice
rich
amber
color
and
a
bitter
caramel
malt
aroma
flavor
was
very
nice
with
generous
grapefruit
up
front
and
finished
with
a
bitter
carameltoffee
nice
hoppy
punch
mediumbodied
medium

beer
had
a
great
deal
of
character
and
a

finished
somewhat
dry
great
beer
the
ballast
point
calico
amber
is
the
best
beer
ii
have
tried
so
far
today
its
number
4
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
with
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
fine
lace
the
scent
had
a
rich
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
a
gloriously
balanced
beer
there
is
a
sharp
bitterness
to
start
then
the
sweet
malt
help
to
cleanse
the
pallete
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
sessionable
beer
i
would
buy
a
12624
pack
no
problem
o
a
decent
beer
and
enjoyable
nothing
is
really
mind
blowing
about
it
but
it
is
a
quality
drinkable
beer
that
brings
a
lot
of
flavor
to
a
5

i
liked
just
about
every
component
of
the
calico
with
the
exception
of
the
finish
which
imparts
a
very
strong
bitterness
but
hey
its
an
esb
so
what
do
you
expect
its
not
my
favorite
from
ballast
point
sculpin
or
big
eye
but
its
a
good
alternative
to
a
typical
esb
2013
labeling
is
way
different
from
what
is
posted
here
at
beer
advocate
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
wasnt
bowled
over
by
it
onice
solid
amber
ale
more
esb
like
with
the
malt
flavors
solid
slightly
foggy
reddened
amber
with
a
tall
head
of
froth
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
smells
fruity
with
some
rounded
malt
berries
raisins
floral
hops
and
a
slight
warm
toastiness
fruity
yeast
esters
creamy
somewhat
biscuity
malts
tealike
hops
pear
and
a
long
bitterness
that
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
nice
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
some
texture
decent
all
around
though
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
obvious
san
diego
style
hop
influence
and
this
seems
to
be
more
on
the
british
side
of
things
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
the
amberred
ale
style
good
bitter
hop
presence
with
a
good
sweet
caramel
malt
balance
oda
solid
brew
but
far
from
a
memorable
one
it
fils
to
distinguish
itself
but
its
far
from
bad
solid
amber
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
will
get
again
overall
not
much
to
say
for
or
against
it
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
again
though
coppery
ale
with
a
tawny
foam
that
persists
leaving
rings
of
lace
smells
like
heavy
whipping
cream
slightly
sugary
honey
cream
its
rather
unique
and
im
digging
the
smell
taste
is
earthy
spicy
lightly
citrus
honey
mildly
bitter
and
lightly
sweet
medium
body
has
some
creaminess
and
holds
together
well
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
amber
ale
overall
this
is
a
perfectly
executed
everyday
amber
there
really
is
nothing
to
complain
about
it
just
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
want
to
return
to
over
and
over
again
i
think
that
is
my
personal
flaw
and
not
any
fault
of
this
very
well
made
beer
overall
i
must
say
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
really
works
for
me
it
takes
out
a
lot
of
the
oversweetness
and
biscuity
character
and
replaces
it
with
lemony
hops
weird
maybe
but
i
like
it
a
lot

a
little
shallow
steely
and
bitter
in
the
finish
which
i
normally
wouldnt
consider
characteristic
of
the
style
this
is
an
extremely
robust
beer
at
5
abv
its
well
crafted
and
they
didnt
take
any
short
cuts
well
crafted
and
very
impressive
recommended
o
good
beer
but
didnt
wow
me
in
any
way
the
appearance
of
this
is
almost
exactly
like
good
amber
maple
syrup
i
hesitate
to
give
a
five
because
can
imagine
such
a
perfect
colour
the
smell
was
rather
fruity
and
left
a
crisp
feeling
in
my
nostrils
the
taste
is
hardly
bitter
and
has
a
nice
fruity
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
i
cant
place
it
it
flows
into
the

and
after
a
few

unbitter

up
growlers
of

after

into

a

this

is

i
have
only
had
one
other
amber
ale
before
lagunitas
lucky
13
which
i
really
enjoyed
but
all
in
all
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
that
being
said
i
felt
like
this
beer
could
have
been
better
and
would
have
really
benefitted
from
some
more
hops
bit
too
tangy
to
be
quaffed
but
not
quite
enough
complexity
to
excite
the
american
hop
fan
in
me
still
nicely
made
beer
and
worth
drinking
this
beer
is
a
good
amount
of
hoppiness
but
also
being
slightly
sweet
to
keep
it
as
an
amber
reminds
me
of
hop
back
from
troegs
drinkability
was
smooth
and
easy
overall
a
solid
if
not
particularly
notable
example
of
the

that
i
prefer

not

going
on
overall
just
above
average
worth
trying

dont

around

o
summing
it
up
im
a
ft
collins
native
i
cut
my
craftbeerlovin
teeth
on
fat
tire
and
alaskan
amber
so
amber
ales
are
near
and
dear
to
me
i
have
to
admit
ballast
point
has
a
deft
touch
when
it
comes
to
this
style
too
insert
calico
cat
joke
here
im
above
such
feline
references
clearly
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
perfumey
toffee
very
light
mint
and
a
hint
of
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mild
greens
mild
flowers
sweet
toffee
and
some
orange
peel
in
the
back
resulting
a
sort
of
off
funky
mess
its
hard
to
put
into
words
beyond
that
just
know
that
i
took
it
as
a
negative
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
strange
little
amber
one
that
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
overall
a
simple
tasty
beer
nothing
too
fancy
or
sophisticated
imagine
a
classic
california
pale
ale
sierra
nevada
or
firestone
with
a
touch
more
malt
and
a
bit
less
hops
overall
pretty
solid
amberred
ale
very
enjoyable
clear
and
reddishn
amber
in
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
beer
has
a
very
malty
and
earthy
hop
smell
aroma
intensity
is
stronger
than
expected
which
is
very
welcomed
malt
toasted
and
breads
plays
a
large
part
in
the
profile
of
this
brew
hops
are
there
but
malt
is
centric
the
taste
is
balancedm
with
a
toast
crust
and
bitter
hop
some
fruit
apricot
and
peach
in
the
shadows
firm
body
slightly
carbonated
long
and
bitter
finish
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
pretty
straight
forward
malty
amber
ale
slightly
forgettable
though
o
overall
this
beer
was
not
a
great
choice
for
my
palate
complex
flavors
overwhelmed
my
desire
for
more
o
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
from
ballast
but
its
a
solid
offering
nonetheless
a
fairly
substantial
sweetness
makes
up
the
malty
backbone
with
an
aroma
of
lemon
and
caramel
the
bitterness
makes
its
way
forward
for
the
long
finish
quite
an
acceptable
quaff
of
a
more
robust
sort
of
amber
ale
while
nothing
special
this
defines
the
style
this
should
appeal
to
those
liking
a
hoppier
amber
but
its
definitely
in
the
maltier
vein
with
a
murky
aftertaste
balanced
but
i
dont
want
that
from
san
diego
overall
didnt
care
for
this
one
much
its
about
9
months
old
it
shouldnt
be
too
old
to
show
what
it
has
i
do
pick
up
some
good
hoppy
flavors
and
to
its
credit
once
my
palate
sort
of
adjusts
some
of
the
subtler
off
flavors
are
minimized
id
try
it
again
overall
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
its
somewhat
heavy
balanced
yet
not
close
to
nugget
nectar
or
any
sweeter
amber
i
prefer
its
very
hard
to
judge
being
this
old
but
other
reviews
agree
its
far
from
exceptional
appearance
is
a
nice
ambercopper
color
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
it
left
extensive
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
a
touch
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
similar
but
id
say
more
hop
forward
than
malt
forward
the
whole
offering
was
a
touch
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
it
is
a
really
nice
blend
of
flavors
nonetheless
overall
this
is
a
good
amber
ale
it
seems
as
though
the
maker
attempted
to
blend
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
with
a
good
amount
of
peppery
and
oily
hops
except
for
all
of
the
tastes
hitting
the
tongue
on
the
front
end
the
maker
largely
succeeds
there
is
a
funky
yeast
taste
that
i
dont
really
like
and
i
dont
believe
fits
this
style
copper
in
color
with
a
light
khaki
head
fluffy
with
big
bubbles
and
good
retention
did
not
get
a
lot
with

nose
some

taste
showcased
the
sweet
malts
bread
caramel
and
little
orange
med
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
very
good
representation
of
the
style
taste
follows
slightly
roasted
malt
and
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
some
faint
citrus
hops
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
pop
for
me
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
more
but
it
feels
like
some
of
the
flavor
was
held
back
i
prefer
a
red
with
a
little
more
substance
and
personality
like
red
racer
from
bear
repub
m
medium
body
and
carb
finishes
mostly
clean
overall
this
brewery
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
they
load
up
their
brews
with
a
great
hop
profile
great
for
those
who
arent
looking
for
something
as
bold
as
an
ipa
would
be
glad
to
drink
this
again
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
tan

that
settles
to

down

is

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
floral
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
not
all
that
great
o
the
balance
and
smoothness
makes
for
an
extremely
drinkable
and
sessionable
brew
although
enjoyable
the
beer
fails
to
stand
out
a
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
when
around
but
not
one
that
i
will
actively
seek
out
o
solid
beer
and
id
love
to
have
more
of
this
calico
gives
just
enough
hoppy
bite
to
make
it
interesting
plenty
of
malt
for
the
body

is

no

at

an

that
leans
more
to
the
hops
than
most
that
ive
had
so
that
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
this
would
be
recommended
overall
its
a
great
beer
and
one
i
will
go
back
to
the
aftertaste
is
unusual
for
the
style
a
considerable
bitter
bite
overall
this
is
an
amber
that
works
for
me
i
also
need
to
revisit
my
other
bp
reviews
and
give
them
a
slight
boost
i
had
a
couple
yesterday
and
today
and
they
are
great
super
sticky
head
big
oily
hop
nose
floral
and
pine
with
citrus
notes
pretty
clean
beer
with
a
big
bitterness
bitter
throughout
with
big
floral
hop
presence
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
undertones
of
caramel
malts
with
some
grapefruit
and
citrus
pretty
big
body
with
big
carbonation
but
the
flavors
hold
up
well
to
it
good
beer
but
for
the
expensive
cost
of
this
six
pack
theres
a
bunch
of
other
ambers
id
take
over
it
slick
and
sticky
but
not
overbearing
again
a
good
beer
just
a
steep

at
the
same

taste

malt
off

with
a
pretty
strong

presence
on
the
tail

feel
is
a
a

thin
but
not
necessarily
a
liability
as
i
could
certainly
imagine
a
session
of
a
few
of
these
good
beer
not
sure
why
theres
a
huge
mouthed
fish
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
decent
amber
ale
though
a
bit
sweet
the
citrusy
hops
lend
a
sweet
fruitiness
to
the
already
sweet
bready
malt
character
its
easy
to
drink
but
in
the
end
simplistic
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
though
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
medium
reddish
color
with
a
nice
creamy
off
white
head
head
clung
extremely
well
aroma
was
nice
and
malty
a
small
bit
of
spicy
sweetness
in
the
backend
taste
was
very
slightly
hoppy
piney
upfront
and
then
switched
to
a
sweet
slightly
fruity
with
a
tad
of
a
spicy
kick
felt
a
bit
over
tangy
on
the
tongue
but
otherwise
coated
well
and
was
nicely
carbonated
overall
not
bad
but
the
tangy
was
an
unexpected
kick
a
solid
choice
amber
ale
has
that
signature
ballast
point
hop
character
which
is
far
from
a
bad
thing
will
consider
having
another

notes
pleasant
surprise
i
recommend
anyone
seeking
this
one
out
especially
if
you
can
find
it
for
less
than
2bottle
like
i
did
o
nice
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
all
around
good
solid
amber
ale
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
peppery
bite
of
carbonation
and
slight
hop
bitterness
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
a
solid
drinker
very
nice
c
t
slight
roasted
malt
and
coffee
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
some
lingering
citrus
hops
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
pretty
solid
amber
o
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
fat
tire
with
more
bitterness
and
less
sweetness
than
fat
tire
although
i
much
prefer
fat
tire
to
this
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
a
little
too
watery
and
not
a
very
exciting
flavor
profile
but
it
is
a
very
easy
drinker
a
very
solid
amber
does
a
good
job
to
have
full
flavor
with
enough
hop
bitterness
to
be
balanced
ballast
point
has
good
beers
across
their
line
and
calico
does
that
statement
justice
doa
notes
most
of
this
brewerys
offerings
are
considerably
more
costly
by
the
bottle
than
your
average
microbrewerys
calico
amber
ale
was
the
cheapest
i
came
across
at
2
25
a
bottle
tastewise
it
almost
crosses
over
into
brown
ale
territory
overall
a
pretty
decent
amber
ale
here
nothing
remarkable
but
very
drinkable
and
good
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
the
beer
has
pleasant
flavor
that
improves
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
low
abv
makes
it
one
you
could
have
several
during
a
session
i
like
this
beer
though
it
is
not
as
great
as
some
of
the
others
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
very
nice
red
im
glad
bp
is
coming
out
this
way
calico
is
an
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
is
yet
another
reason
to
be
happy

the
only

the

o
an
excellent
light

very
high
overall
ab
o
not
a
terrible
amber

and
certainly
a
hop
forward
option
for
someone
seeking
the
ubiquitous
5
abv
american
red
ale
ballast
point
has
hoppier
and
tastier
options
but
this
is
a
nice
stab
for
their
session
brew
i
suppose
o
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
and
sessionable
offering
from
ballast
point
i
think
the
mixture
of
malt
and
hop
profiles
is
well
done
and
the
hint
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
works
well
with
the
overall
flavor
this
does
the
trick
if
you
want
a
good
allaround
and
easydrinking
beer
to
enjoy
over
the
course
of
the
night
i
poured
this
brew
into
a
becker
pint
glass
i
was
treated
to
a
perfect
amber
hued
brew
that
delivered
about
a
fingers
worth
of
khaki
head
that
left
impressively
good
lacing
i
brought
the
glass
to
my
nose
and
took
in
a
deep
whiff
was
greeted
by
aromas
of
toasted
malt
and
pleasant
hop
notes
the
flavors
of
toffee
caramel
and
toasted
malt
combined
to
make
one
of
the
most
unique
and
inspiring
beers
ive
tasted
in
a

drank
this

has
an
almost
chewy

o
tasty
and
sessionable
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
from
ballast
point
but
still
decent
d
not
bad
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
hop
forward
beer
and
while
this
beer
is
balanced
it
is
very
much
about
the
sweet
malty
side
rather
than
the
hops
drinkable
but
not
something
im
real
excited
about
easy
to
drink
though
not
super
complex
worth
a
try
not
the
best
beer
by
any
means
from
ballast
point
but
has
a
respectable
position
in
their
lineup
overall
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
but
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
it
was
almost
like
a
dessert
beer
at
times
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
a
try
o
pretty
darn

this

with
a
really
nice
rich
looking
copper
amber
color
the
head
is
solid
and
has
a
good
retention
not
much

but
still
has
a
good
appearance
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
and
had
a
decent

taste
of
the

the

this

was
pretty
good
not
a

no
its
not
the
most
exciting
brew
in
the
world
but
its
solid
o
a
good
effort
from
ballast
point
on
this
one
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
which
is
not
my
style
refreshing
and
fruity
and
i
would
probably
drink
this
offering
again
fairly
well
crafted
with
a
good
blend
of
flavors
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
what
can
be
deemed
a
bit
of
a
boring
style
quite
like
it
especially
for
this
time
of
year
in
sydney
australia
where
it
is
1528
degrees
celsius
o
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
for
what
i
mistook
as
an
accessible
beer
to
the
masses
this
one
borderlines
an
ipa
but
is
probably
best
summed
as
a
west
coast
amber
or
red
ballast
point
is
quickly
becoming
my
new
favorite
brewery
i
hadnt
really
discovered
until
now
id
wont
hide
the
fact
that
calico
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
i
wouldnt
argue
its
something
you
could
really
compare
to
an
ipa
like
sculpin
but
that
doesnt
diminish
its
qualities
considering
its
not
that
type
of
beer
o
another
great
brew
from
ballast
point
i
havent
been
disappointed
yet
would
happily
have
more
of
this
amber
o
solid
amber
ale
nice
color
and
lacing
an
inviting
aroma
and
a
crisp
malty
taste
deep
copper
in
colour
with
a
little
haze
and
a
dark
beige
cap
decent
head
retention
with
some
streaky
lacing
malty
caramel
aroma
a
little
grassy
and
biscuity
same
in
the
flavour
some
nuttiness
moderate
bitterness
a
touch
of
pine
and
mint
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
overall
pretty
solid
and
drinkable
d
really
nice
and
drinkable
but
not
really
thirst
quenching
very
tasty
and
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
im
sure
this
would
have
been
much
better
out
of
a
pint
glass
or
bottle
but
sometimes
you
have
to
go
with
what
you
have
will
give
it
another
try
and
check
the
ratings
then
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
hold
a
special
spot
for
ambers
as
they
were
my
favorite
when
i
got
into
craft
beer
and
this
one
steps
it
up
some
with
additional
hops
to
keep
thing
interesting
worth
getting
if
you
see
it
around
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
now
and
its
just
not
for
me
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
always
feel
it
has
off
flavors
wow
another
great
beer
from
ballast
point
theyre
somewhat
hard
to
come
by
here
in
the
ne
but
everyone
ive
had
so
far
has
been
exceptional
this
one
has
a
dark
amber
slightly
cloudy
color
and
great
aroma
hops
and
malt
are
very
well
balanced
with
spicy
notes
and
the
faintest
hint
of
the
booze
so
drinkable
i
love
the
way
bp
is
able
to
really
bring
out
the
hoppy
flavors
and
all
their
subtleties
without
overwhelming
the
palette
with
pure
bitterness
highly
recommended
citric
and
grassy
notes
intertwine
with
stronger
bready
and
caramel
aromas
its
fairly
nimble
in
spite
of
the
thickish
caramel
body
with
juicy
citrus
and
anice
bitter
streak
cutting
through
the
sweetness
earthy
and
toasted
flavors
float
in
and
out
at
times
especially
in
the
finish
nice
little
amber
ale
here
there
are
a
few
great
mysteries
in
the
fooddrink
world
how
do
they
get
the
caramel
in
the
caramilk
bar
whats
in
cocacolas
secret
formula
how
many
licks
does
it
take
to
get
to
the
center
of
a
tootsiepop
and
now
we
must
also
wonder
how
ballast
point
balances
calico
amber
with
so
much
fruity
madeiralike
richness
and
coffee
cake
and
honeycomb
toffee
flavour
and
so
much
zesty
american
hoppiness
thanks

o
i
quite
enjoyed
this
brew
though
i
must
admit
it
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
i
found
this
to
have
more
of
a
tart
citrus
flavor
which
i
am
guessing
were
lent
by
the
hops
instead
of
the
more
roasted
maltcentric
ambers
i
am
used
to
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
odd
as
well
coming
off
as
almost
mineral
waterlike
with
a
very
crisp
finish
that
left
almost
no
risidual
matter
on
the
tongue
that
said
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
even
refreshing
i
must
say
it
is
quite
on
par
with
other
beers
in
the
amber
category
though
it
will
not
wow
you
in
any
way
cheers
poured
into
a
nondescript
pint
glass
a
clear
tangerineamber
color
with
a
thin
wispy
head
pretty
basic
aroma
with
a
decent
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malts
almost
reminiscent
of
an
apa
basically
the
same
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
balance
of
the
malt
and
hop
elements
very
nice
for
an
amber
ale
meduim
mouthfeel
and
very
easily
drinkable
the
brew
pours
amber
obviously
with
decent
head
and
lace
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
toasty
grain
but
herbal
dankness
explodes
on
the
palate
the
disparity
between
mellow
grain
aroma
and
surprisingly
vibrant
hop
flavor
creates
an
intriguing
dynamic
lighter
than
medium
soft
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
is
actually
one
of
my
favorite
bp
brews
overall
poured
out
an
amber
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
fluffy
slightly
off
white
head
a
light
biscuit
malt
aroma
with
a
tangy
fruit
hop
aroma
flavor
is
light
and
bready
malt
with
a
light
citrus
hop
bite
finishes
with
a
sweet
and
tangy
malthop
finish
for
the
light
malt
body
it
has
a
full
character
creamy
bready
malt
body
and
tangy
hop
finish
o
overall
a
good
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
one
at
the
breweryhome
brew
mart
in
linda
vista
poured
a
nice
clear
copper
hue
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
on
top
aromas
of
biscuit
light
grain
and
grassy
hops
on
the
palate
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
light
bodied
and
refreshing
with
flavors
of
grassy
hops
oranges
and
light
caramel
overall
an
excellent
amber
ale
and
very
quaffable
this
is
something
i
wish
i
always
had
access
to
recommended
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
either
to
savor
or
as
a
session
beer
i
am
a
hophead
but
i
can
enjoy
a
well
constructed
malty
beer
too

remind
you
what
awaits
the
next
sip
d
overall
it
drinks
very
smoothly
and
is
a
fine
example
for
the
style
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
i
have
been
very
spoilt
lately
with
all
these
great
american
beers
that
i
never
usually
see
but
am
seeing
alot
of
now
and
this
is
another
it
pours
a
see
through
light
copper
hue
that
has
nice
carbonation
which
leaves
behind
a
cream
coloured
two
finger
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
layer
of
froth
and
some
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
quite
nice
with
hints
of
peanut
brittlesticky
toffee
and
some
floral
hopsit
has
a
lightmedium

well
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
is
perfectly
suited
to
allow
the
tastes
of
butterscotch
fudgetoffeecandied
grapefruit
all
to
make
their
own
cameo
before
being
finished
off
with
a

hoppy
bitterness
which
really
rounds
this
brew
out
and
for
a
amber
fan
like
myself
i
have
had
better
examples
but
in
saying
that
i
could
easily
session
on
this
brew
anyday
of
the
week
drink
i
need
to
get
through
a
lot
of
the
california
beers
as
trading
has
calmed
down
and
i
need
to
develop
some
homer
pride
for
ca
as
i
have
lived
here
for
10
years
i
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
except
for
a
nitro
or
a
cask
if
ever
in
sd
poured
on
nitro
at
the
brewery
the
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
my
wife
and
i
actually
ordered
one
ontap
and
one
nitro
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
most
of
this
review
will
be
in
comparison
to
the
ontap
version
the
beer
has
a
darker
red
coloring
with
a
foamier
and
lighter
colored
big
bubbled
head
slight
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
but
barely
detectable
the
body
is
rounder
and
much
creamier
and
the
hops
flavors
come
across
a
bit
muted
nutty
flavors
are
good
and
strong
but
the
hops
leave
it
a
bit
unbalanced
very
smooth
finish
with
minimal
aftertaste
almost
watery
amazing
difference
between
nitro
and
tap
overall
this
beer
is
not
amazing
but
it
will
grow
on
you
especially
because
of
the
aroma
appearance
and
mouthfeel
o
ballast
point
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
solid
offerings
good
solid
amber
ale
brewed
for
jd
wetherspoons
spring
beer
fest
2011
and
slightly
different
at
5
2
looks
quite
nice
amber
frothy
head
decent
lacing
smell
muted
but
nice
floural
hops
decent
malt
backbone
slightly
doughy
taste
is
similar
but
hoppie
rthan
i
expected
especially
at
first
mellows
out
nicely
and
you
get
some
sweet
citrus
and
biscuity
finish
once
again
i
find
almost
all
cask
ales
to
have
amazing
mouthfeel
and
this
was
no
different
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
i
would
def
have
it
again
this
guy
is
actually
a
fairly
dark
amber
it
could
equally
pass
for
a
red
ale
the
head
was
very
pretty
dense
good
retention
a
excellent
lacing
on
the
nose
i
couldnt
get
much
other
than
yeast
and
malts
maybe
a
little
orange
peel
the
only
outstanding
quality
tastewise
is
the
hoppymetallic
finish
which
plays
well
with
the
bubbly
sharp
texture
other
than
that
a
very
conservative
amber
ale
which
for
the
genre
is
par
i
guess
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
wont
buy
another
sixer
only
because
i
prefer
the
more
complex
ballast
point
varieties
sort
of
uninspiring
and
bland
compared
to
the
regular
bottled
version
still
decent
with
food
though
o
at
5
and
with
such
a
great
taste
this
one
is
incredibly
drinkable
most
any
time
pours
a
nice
cherry
wood
color
with
a
milky
colored
onefinger
head
nice
lacing
and
retention
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruit
aroma
little
caramel
as
well
big
malts
dark
cherries
lead
the
way
some
sticky
caramel
and
toffee
notes
as
well
more
subtle
citrus
hops
and
earthy
notes
round
the
beer
out
simple
and
well
done
really
nice
amber
flavors
o
a
quintessential
craft
session
brew
this
is
a
really
nice
everyday
beer
and
one
i
hope
to
have
stocked
in
my
cold
fridge
this
hot
summer
ballast
point
continues
to
impress
and
their
calico
copper
get
my
seal
of
approval
d
stuff
is
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
this
very
weird
aftertaste
i
just
cant
shake
it
really
a
shame
i
want
to
like
this
beer
but
i
just
cant
bring
myself
to
do
so
appearance
is
a
medium
amber
tone
with
a
one
finger
head
its
smell
is
a
mix
of
malts
hops
cookie
dough
and
some
spice
taste
has
citrus
hops
candy
with
some
sweet
bitterness
in
the
end
mf
is
medium
drinkability
is
pretty
good
in
this
amber
style
from
ballast
point
a
couple
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
leisurely
meal
would
make
a
good
fit
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
almost
zero
head
it
has
a
semihopy
aroma
at
the
first
sip
the
hop
disappears
and
is
taken
over
by
a
good
amount
of
malt
flavor
i
think
the
malt
overpowers
the
hoppiness
i
did
detect
a
little
vanilla
taste
its
smooth
and
what
i
like
in
any
beverage
the
start
and
finish
is
the
same
d
oh
it
was
drinkable
dont
you
worry
d
smooth
drinking
beer
could
definitely
put
down
a
lot
of
these
overall
its
slightly
ridiculous
that
thiswas
my
first
time
trying
this
and
ive
probably
seen
it
more
than
a
hundred
times
its
smooth
drinkable
and
damn
tasty
d
good
amber
ale
that
is
well
balanced
low
enough
abv
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
i
guess
since
nugget
nectar
set
the
standard
for
me
this
doesnt
compare
to
that
but
still
a
good
offering
from
ballast
point
body
is
really
well
balanced
with
enough
fluidity
to
go
with
a
full
body
carbonation
is
ample
but
not
overdone
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
as
the
hops
get
you
ready
for
the
next
malty
sip
really
really
well
crafted
beer
md
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
had
a
little
less
carbonation
than
i
was
expecting
overall
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
would
definitely
get
some
if
only
it
was
sold
where
i
live
this
is
pretty
solid
for
drinkability
and
would
have
again
no
problem
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
slightly
assertive
amount
of
carbonation
weird
that
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
so
disappointing
when
everything
else
about
it
is
nice
some
dry
hopping
could
knock
this
one
out
of
the
park
poured
a
golden
red
ale
with
great
head
and
lace
a
real
hoppy
bitter
hops
more
like
it
and
a
thick
malt
presence
as
well
a
smooth
and
creamy
beer
that
has
an
offkilter
buttery
sweetness
which
threw
me
for
a
loop
there
is
some
hoppy
goodness
in
this
beer
as
well
i
would
say
a
mix
of
citric
and
grassy
and
there
is
that
sweet
edge
as
well
as
breadiness
for
a
balanced
beer
all
around
a
good
red
ale
and
if
you
like
them
a
little
sweeter
than
the
norm
youll
like
this
one
would
be
nice
to
get
this
fresh
as
i
cant
figure
out
if
there
is
any
bottling
code
on
here
over
all
id
say
this
is
an
average
amber
nothing
too
special
but
i
got
it
in
the
ballast
point
variety
pack
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
overlook
standing
as
it
is
in
the
shadow
of
some
of
ballast
points
more
hyped
contributions
still
it
is
a
fine
englishstyle
pale
ale
with
big
flavors
that
is
not
out
of
place
alongside
alesmiths
anvil
esb
in
fact
it
is
what
many
were
likely
expecting
the
first
time
they
ordered
another
of
ballast
points
beers
the
yellowtail
germanstyle
pale
ale
a
decent
red
ale
an
odd
mix
of
flavors
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
herbally
hops
other
than
sculpin
ballast
point
hasnt
impressed
me
much
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
bottle
so
far
its
been
a
solid
version
of
a
west
coast
amber
appears
a
deep
caramel
amber
hue
with
a
light
khaki
tan
head
forming
fine
even
speckled
lacing
as
it
dwindles
down
aromatics
offer
up
a
slight
caramel
malt
presence
with
a
mild
citruspine
cone
accented
hops
flavor
has
some
sweet
cereal
grains
with
herbalcitrupine
hop
combo
mild
approachable
hop
bitterness
not
to
brash
and
off
putting
but
great
flavor
and
balance
within
this
beers
profile
mouthfeel
is
lighter
to
medium
bodied
smooth
even
carbonation
levels
great
feel
hits
the
palate
quaffable
and
refreshing
drinkability
smooth
session
ale
nice
balanced
mix
of
malts
and
hops
not
another
generic
amber
ale
d
the
score
took
a
big
hit
due
to
the
big
presence
of
the
soapiness
and
pickles
that
makes
it
a
one
and
done
for
me
pours
a
nice
rich
red
color
very
little
foam
smell
is
hops
and
very
very
little
floral
notes
taste
is
nice
like
smoked
hops
but
not
too
hoppy
nicely
balanced
after
taste
is
just
hops
mouth
feel
is
light
goes
down
real
easy
as
far
as
drinkaility
goes
you
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
nice
malty
aromas
with
some
metallic
smells
mixed
in
flavors
a
fairly
full
but
the
hops
hit
in
pretty
quick
i
found
myself
noticing
the
hops
more
and
more
not
bad
but
i
will
keep
that
in
mind
before
i
purchase
again
this
is
a
hoppy
red
but
just
keeps
things
in
balance
wow
surprised
to
find
a
bomber
of
fresh
calico
amber
at
a
small
shop
i
occasionally
stop
in
paid
3
99
for
the
bottle
very
impressed
with
the
rich
rubyamber
color
and
lasting
head
smells
of
malt
and
some
hopsnice
zesty
yeast
too
tastes
really
nicecomplex
blend
of
malt
bready
yeast
some
sweetness
and
a
kiss
of
bitter
hops
very
nice
body
and
mouthfeel
emminently
drinkable
at
5
abv
this
is
as
solid
an
amber
ale
as
they
come
a
very
good
offering
from
ballast
point
salut
overallgreat
example
of
the
style
all
the
right
notes
stands
up
to
any
other
version
superb
a
solid
amber
but
not
the
most
exciting
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
red
the
hopforward
style
makes
it
stand
out
from
its
peers
im
not
finding
it
to
be
exceptional
but
a
welldone
beer
that
could
absolutely
tickle
someone
the
right
way
drink
well
my
friends
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
another
winner
from
ballast
point
and
one
to
seek
out
this
ale
pours
a
copper
brown
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
has
a
big
head
the
head
lasts
a
while
and
is
lacey
around
my
glass
the
smell
is
unremarkable
just
a
typical
scent
of
a
redamber
ale
the
taste
is
good
but
not
surprising
its
a
little
dry
at
the
end
and
the
bitter
from
the
hops
is
muted
by
the
maltiness
and
caramel
flavors
the
beer
is
rather
light
drinkability
goes
down
easy
dthis
is
nothing
special
but
a
fine
example
of
the
style
a
good
6pack
for
the
autumn
months
drinkability
easy
to
drink
with
just
enough
different
flavors
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
this
is
a
good
anytime
beer
to
drink
with
friends
or
with
dinner
foams
up
very
strongly
with
an
average
down
the
center
pour
easily
half
the
glass
settles
down
to
about
two
fingers
of
a
very
delicate
fine
tannish
head
dimples
appreciably
some
larger
bubbles
coming
out
as
a
result
below
average
stickiness
to
the
lacing
deep
amber
to
coppery
orangered
mild
haze
but
still
easy
to
see
through
it
metallic
cast
just
about
exactly
as
youd
expect
the
liquid
to
look
malty
nose
with
ample
milk
chocolate
malted
milk
balls
caramel
and
fresh
butter
accents
this
not
to
ignore
the
also
powerful
pine
and
pin
to
white
grapefruit

no
lack
of
spine
here
not
quite
floral
but
good
amount
of
peach

ends
with
a
bitter
grass
and
wet
kindling
wood
embers
mediumbodied
hoppier
here
with
the
emphasis
on
the
pine
fresh

white

biscuits
the
floral
notes
succeed
better
towards
the
end
leaves
your
mouth
dry
with
a
tacky
residue
before
half
the
glass
is
empty
the
caramel
toffee
cocoa
powder
breaks
a
sweat
to
keep
what
little
ground
it
gains
wish
there
were
a
little
more
sweetness
for

instead
you
get
heavy
carbonation
in
an
attempt
to
provide
relief
for
the
tongue
less
out

more
solid
delivery
would
seal
the
deal
drinkability
a
very
nice
session
beer
from
ballast
point
its
good
to
see
this
versatile
brewery
is
capable
of
making
a
hopped
up
session
beer
that
wont
ruin
the
palate
drinkability
is
wonderful
ballast
point
has
squeezed
all
te
flavorthey
could
muster
into
this
5
amber
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
content
can
make
it
sessionable
the
drinkability
improves
as
the
beer
warms
up
drinkability
the
sweet
taste
and
the
balanced
feel
make
this
quite
a
balanced
drinkable
brew
d
a
nice
malty
beer
that
can
certainly
be
sessioned
d
god
i
could
quaff
this
beer
all
night
i
love
the
balance
of
hopsmalts
this
is
an
exceptional
amber
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
just
outstanding
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
cheers
drinkability
is
high
on
this
its
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
for
an
amber
ale
at
5
this
beer
has
got
a
lot
of
flavor
and
body
picked
up
a
single
from
abes
with
a
mixed
6er
it
poured
a
tall
head
over
a
clear
amberred
body
the
aroma
is
a
little
odd
coming
off
like
creamy
cranberries
the
flavor
however
is
quite
rich
with
nutty
and
toffee
malts
citrus
hops
and
cranberry
juice
quite
a
combination
the
finish
is
dry
and
almost
astringent
i
may
not
be
a
huge
fan
of
the
aroma
but
this
is
an
impressive
beer
i
cant
remember
the
last
amber
i
had
that
was
this
complex
with
just
being
crammed
full
of
hops
what
a
nice
surprise
d
very
very
easy
to
drink
more
simple
than
some
other
bp
fare
but
delicious
a
flavorful
lighter
beer
that
will
be
great
for
summer
this
really
knows
what
it
is
and
does
it
well
d
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
many
beer
in
a
session
kind
of
beer
but
this
one
is
too
hoppy
for
the
style
for
my
taste
seems
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
a
red
ale
color
is
good
for
a
red
but
the
taste
is
more
pale
ale
im
still
not
a
big
hops
guy
so
this
one
is
not
my
fav
drinkability
its
a
pretty
good
brew
but
a
little
hoppy
for
my
tastes
drinkability
im
drinking
it
im
not
trying
to
savor
it
but
im
not
choking
it
down
either
if
i
really
liked
the
taste
of
hops
or
if
the
hops
flavor
was
more
balanced
with
other
flavors
then
i
would
like
this
beer
much
more
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
prefer
other
american
ambers
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
caramel
malt
scent
along
with
some
bready
bisquit
malts
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
the
smell
is
good
but
it
seems
its
a
bit
muttled
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
bitter
hop
bite
up
front
along
with
a
ton
of
breadiness
and
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
the
finish
its
bone
dry
and
overly
bready
for
my
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
may
be
a
very
good
amber
ale
to
some
but
its
a
little
too
complex
for
me
the
bisquit
character
is
too
much
pours
copper
to
orange
with
some
slight
haze
and
generous
white
head
nose
is
mostly
citrus
with
some
caramel
too
on
the
palate
the
caramel
comes
through
as
well
as
some
dark
sweeter
malty
flavors
hops
balance
it
out
though
but
to
me
they
remain
in
the
background
theres
a
complex
malt
sweetness
in
this
ale
great
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
with
a
good
white
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
simple
with
a
dominant
caramel
breadiness
to
it
the
flavor
is
nicer
with
the
caramel
malt
coming
through
as
well
as
a
nice
slight
hoppiness
medium
body
and
good
drinkability
all
around
by
the
end
i
was
really
enjoying
this
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
enough
going
on
to
have
this
stick
to
your
ribs
not
my
favorite
from
ballast
point
but
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
any
occasion
d
good
balanced
flavors
and
a
moderate
alcohol
content
make
this
a
great
session

really
well
well
the

the

a
really
nice

not
amazing

really
drinkable
poured
a

with

lingered
thru

was
a
pleasant
mix
of
malty
dark
fruit
toasted
nuts
and
honey
with
a
hint
of
hopy
citrus

mouthfeel
was
full
slightly
tingly
and
almost
chewy
and
the
taste
picked
up
the
flavors
of
the

perfectly
rounded
off
to
a
long
pleasant
finish
with
a
great
aftertaste
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
damn
good

offerings
a
perfect
session
beer
im
loathe
to
say
anything
from
sd
is
better
than
la
this
one
sits
right
at
the
benchmark
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
very
flavorful
with
the
californian
flare
west
coast
session
ale
all
the
way
dvery
tasty
and
crisp
goes
down
nicely
and
would
probably
be
great
on
a
warm
day
poured
a
nice
pumpkin
copper
orange
with
minimal
white
head
smell
was
of
some
hoppy
pines
and
citrus
as
well
as
a
fair
amount
of
biscuit
malt
taste
had
more
of
that
biscuit
malt
up
front
with
a
nice
hoppy
bite
in
back
some
caramel
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
creamy
a
little
light
on
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
real
nice
reading
the
other
reviews
i
am
kind
of
surprised
and
i
think
that
i
am
drinking
a
different
beer
than
they
are
perhaps
it
is
past
the
date
where
it
is
still
good
and
my
store
didnt
rotate
it
for
some
reason
if
that
is
the
case
i
apologize
for
my
less
than
stellar
review
but
nonetheless
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
and
will
probably
not
be
getting
it
again
tasty
and
drinkable
good
representation
of
the
style
thanks
to

i
would
give
the
nod
to
the

by
a
narrow
margin
but
there
is
more
than
enough
hop
profile
going
on
very
drinkable
when
judged
for
style
its
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
drinkability
i
can
easily
see
myself
putting
down
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
and
hardly
even
realize
it
simply
this
beer
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
wont
change
your
life
but
i
think
i
found
my
new
goto
amber
overall
will
definitely
buy
again
this
time
in
a

hopefully
on
tap
somewhere
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
laces
well
the
smell
is
both
sweet
and
bready
at
the
same
time
theres
substance
to
the
nose
on
this
one
not
necessarily
a
lot
going
on
here
but
theres
substance
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
nose
of
course
theres
some
residual
sweetness
but
mostly
just
big
bready
malts
and
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
excellent
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
which
leaves
a
small
lace
on
the
side
of
the

smell
and
taste
are
of
bitter
grapefruit
flavored
hops
and
biscuit
malt
finishes
dry
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
leaves
a
disagreeable
bitter
aftertaste
was
excited
to
hear
that
rattle
n
hum
had
this
on
cask
it
poured
a
deep
amber
and
laced
surprisingly
well
had
a
nice
bouquet
of
citrus
woodiness
vanilla
and
malty
breadiness
the
taste
started
with
citrus
and
breadiness
but
ended
on
a
hop
note
a
little
too
bitter
on
the
finish
as
well
the
cask
certainly
gave
it
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
an
american
amber
the
lack
of
overall
balance
in
this
beer
didnt
have
me
rushing
to
order
another
one
but
i
could
certainly
see
this
as
a
decent
session
beer
12oz
poured
amber
with
a
slight
haze
and
was
topped
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
held
great
retention
and
left
some
excellent
sticky
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aromas
were
caramely
malty
sweetness
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
toasted
grains
with
faint
hints
of
floral
hops
tastes
were
similar
to
aromas
and
very
complex
biscuity
bready
malt
brown
sugar
and
caramel
notes
with
a
slight
hop
bite
on
the
bittersweet
finish
consisting
of
citrus
notes
and
mild
pine
mouthfeel
was
fairly
creamy
and
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
this
is
probably
hopped
more
than
an
amber
should
be
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
take
on
an
american
amber
ale
d
the
low
abv
and
relative
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
make
it
an
easy
drinker

good

d
this
is
a
wonderful
beer

go
with

d
this

is
awesome
typically
this
is
one
of
those
styles
that
we
pass
over

this
may
force
us
to
change
our

the

the

great

this
is
a
truly

i
expect
nothing

pour
a
pretty
dark

color
almost
ruby
with
an
average
eggshell
colored

that
dissipated
into

light
ring
the

a
nice

not
strong

nice

some

some

not

a

cant
say
that
it
quite
conforms
to
the

but
a
very
good
beer
indeed
nice
maltyness
and
hop
balance
very
sessionable
at
5
abv
d
i
could
hammer
these
all
night
such
balance
and
flavor
great
beer
and
am
glad
i
have
tried
it
well
the
smell
was
great
but
this
lacked
flavor
to
me
so
it
was
a
disappointment
pours
out
a
deep
clear
red
ruby
with
a
thin
white
head
the
head
was
gone
as
soon
as
id
gotten
done
smelling
it
about
average
id
say
good
color
and
clarity
poor
head
the
smell
is
light
on
the
hops
moderate
on
the
malts
a
tiny
whiff
of
tropical
fruits
and
oranges
comes
up
followed
by
a
powdery
sweetness
no
real
whiff
of
breadiness
the
taste
for
the
average
american
amber
ale
is
right
on
the
money
a
nice
pleasant
fruity
hop
presence
comes
by
tart
cherries
orange
just
a
bit
of
leafiness
like
tea
in
the
background
then
theres
a
sweet
tea
finish
with
a
tiny
bit
of
a
biscuity
malt
presence
something
feels
kind
of
syrupy
in
this
maybe
the
low
carbonation
did
it
but
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
more
full
than
i
expected
and
this
one
is
overall
very
nice
not
the
most
enjoyable
of
all
but
a
bit
better
than
average
i
probably
wouldnt
enthusiastically
buy
this
but
id
say
it
was
worth
the
visit
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
in
taste
a
bit
of
toasty
breadiness
on
the
tongue
crisp
and
clean
on
the
finish
as
the
sweetness
doesnt
overwhelm
a
nicely
balanced
amber
with
good
flavor
and
drinkability
particularly
for
someone
who
doesnt
prefer
simple
sweet
versions
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
ambercopper
with
about
a
half
inch
of
white
rocky
head
head
recedes
pretty
quickly
leaving
thin
wispy
lacing
nose
is
outstanding
the
caramel
malts
are
well
done
in
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
bready
malts
that
are
faint
if
only
the
taste
picked
up
where
the
nose
left
off
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
the
taste
was
muted
the
bready
malts
dominated
and
werent
well
balanced
between
the
caramel
and
hops
that
are
present
it
seemed
unequal
and
offbalance
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
medium
carbonation
slight
grainy
texture
in
the
mouth
with
a
sticky
finish
the
offbalance
in
the
taste
lessens
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
but
i
will
look
to
try
it
once
more
in
hopes
of
simply
getting
a
bad
batch
this
time
around
d
great
drinkability
a
balanced
amber
ale
might
be
my
favorite
style
for
a
session
beer
d
this
beer
starts
out
as
a
solid
beer
great
smell
and
taste
but
for
me
the
ending
flavor
and
watery
mouthfeel
didnt
settle
well
a
decent
beer
for
a
hopped
up
amberred
ale
im
sticking
to
my
story
with
ballast
point
these
guys
know
how
to
brew
some
seriously
citrusy
beer
calicos
a
really
nice
amber
ale
that
i
like
quite
a
bit
id
prefer
just
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
but
when
isnt
that
true
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
nice
take
on
the
style
thats
way
too
drinkable
i
wish
we
saw
this
here
in
ohio
good
stuff
d
with
no
bottling
date
i
have
no
idea
where
the
hops
should
be
but
i
trust
the
source
so
im
guessing
hops
were
not
the
focus
in
this
either
way
this
was
an
enjoyable
amber
with
a
mild
hop
sense
going
for
it
very
sessionable
though
i
would
pick
up
a
case
for
a
party
d
a
hop
driven
amber
ale
that
has
great
balance
and
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
d
a
malty
amber
that
is
easily
drinkable
but
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
many
others
in
its
class
is
this
a
study
in
the
west
coast
amber
ale
style
this
brew
definitely
leaned
more
toward
the
hops
than
i
expected
at
first
i
wanted
the
malt
body
to
assert
itself
more
but
the
more
i
drank
it
the
less
bothered
i
became
this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
not
sure
if
i
will
buy
for
myself
again
but
i
know
a
few
friends
who
may
fancy
this
a
good
steppingstone
beer
incredibly
unique
beer
to
me
highly
unexpected
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
is
a
example
of
a
californiaized
beer
of
a
style
pours
a
clear
amber
with
nice
head
and
lacing
nose
has
a
strong
malt
character
with
honey
cinnamon
and
floral
hops
taste
has
a
caramel
approach
with
a
nice
hop
finish
a
bit
wet
but
quite
drinkable
ambers
dont
excite
me
but
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
ambers
are
usually
one
of
the
weaker
offerings
from
a
lot
of
craft
brewers
this
one
is
by
no
means
a
weak
offering
and
recommend
giving
it
a
try
had
2
beers
from
this
brewery
before
and
enjoyed
them
immensely
this
one
is
also
very
good
im
a
sucker
for
a
nice
red
ale
and
this
one
is
different
but
refreshing
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
tons
of
lacing
and
a
nice
headglorious
taste
is
more
malty
than
expected
very
malty
actually
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
kick
in
at
the
end
but
its
not
as
hoppy
as
most
other
red
ales
out
there
dont
get
me
wrong
i
lvoe
me
some
hops
but
this
beer
mixes
it
up
and
good
and
makes
for
a
nice
well
balanced
brew
greta
mouthfeel
and
body
make
this
an
easy
drinker
too
bad
i
have
only
found
it
in
massachusetts
boo
connecticut
d
good
but
should
contain
more
amber
like
characteristics
and
i
was
displeased
with
the
dryness
in
the
mouthfeel
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
with
some
wispy
notes
would
like
a
bit
more
depth
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
have
like
some
more
depth
on
the
malt
side
and
balance
with
the
great
hop
flavor
d
a
good
session
beer
not
overly
complex
but
does
the
trick
the
drink
is
fullish
in
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
thickish
almost
syrupy
linger
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
okay
but
all
in
all
the
brew
is
nothing
to
write
home
over
good
drinkable
brew
very
nice
pour
a
clear
copper
with
amber
hues
creamy

with
excellent

sugary

a

good

and
again
a
lightly

interesting

a

this
beautiful

big

a
bonus
the
nose
leads
me
to
believe
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
balanced
offering
from
ballast
point
sweet
caramel
malt
blended
evenly
with

enticing
for
a
amber

good
amount
of

greets
the
tongue
fading
into
bread
crust
and
back
to
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
the
subtlety
of
the
caramel
malt
adds
complexity
while
not
competing
to
hard
for
the
top
spotthat
award
goes
to
the
citrusy
hops
this
is
so
creamy
and
drinkable
my
taste
buds
are
telling
me
to
sip
slower
and
make
this
last
while
my
hand
i
can
barely
remove
from
my
glass
this
is
an
outstanding

pours

with

an

drinker
i
would
have
no
issue
with
having
this
one
again
nice
to
see
it
relatively
cheap
on
shelves
drinkability
mighty
bitter
for
an
amber
but
in
the
final
analysis
it
is
still
an
amber
the
aroma
is
piny
with
citrus
and
caramel
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
large
tan
head
the
flavor
is
astringent
and
malty
with
plenty

the

is

this
is
a

and
you
may
find
the

disappearing

5
nice
interpretation
of
the
amber
beer
style
picked
this
up
due
to
the
cheap
price
and
my
love
of
amber
ales
on
the
open
and
pour
dark
typical
amber
ale
sexy
mediumthin
head
leaves
a
medium
lacing
that
fits
the
beer
smells
super
bready
yeasty
like
biscuits
taste
is
super
spicey
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
spice
lots
of
piney
hops
here
theres
a
spice
in
here
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
but
it
gives
the
beer
a
dill
pickle
type
taste
to
it
almost
seems
like
its
coming
from
the
hops
but
something
tells
me
it
doesnt
maybe
this
is
an
old
batch
either
way
it
sounds
gross
but
its
good
and
it
works
with
the
piney
hops
extremely
well
really
satisfying
incredibly
drinkable
super
enjoyable
beer
my
love
amber
ale
continues
and
im
sure
to
pick
up
some
more
ballast
brews
what
is
it
about
san
diego
that
produces
such
good
breweries
thanks
go
out
to
getkrunkhoe
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
possibly
one
of
the
best
ambers
out
there
pure
copper
pour
with
heavy
caramel
and
malt
aromas
the
toffee
is
prevalent
in
the
taste
but
comes
with
a
nice
blend
of
malt
caramel
and
vanilla
flavors
liek
the
yellowtail
there
is
a
nuttiness
that
shows
through
on
occasion
hoppycitrus
quality
which
seems
to
borrow
from
an
xpa
or
a
california
pale
not
as
bitter
as
the
traditional
esb
but
very
very
nice
the
taste
is
malty
and
fruity
bitter
before
becoming
a
bit
sweet
with
faint
flowery
hops
and
a
hint
of
toffee
it
then
finishes
very
bitter
and
dry
with
a
strong
hoppy
pinegrapefruit

with

two

good

and
broken
bands
of

the
aroma
was
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
floral

the
flavors
were
good
a
blend
of
sweet

up

followed
by
a
more
biscuity

in
the
middle
and
a

bite
at

that
made
it
crisp
the

was
medium
and
almost
light
but
not
watery
the
carbonation
right
on
and
the
mouthfeel
quite
smooth

a

hoppier

in

nothing
to

about

update
december
2008
i
very
much
appreciated
the
traditional
bready
malts
this
has
all
the
makings
of
an
exceptional
ale
although
the
amber
label
is
misleading
the
one
element
missing
is
the
peaty
quality
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
duh
hue
with
three
fingers
worth
of
sticky
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
left
a
very
nice
collar
of
lace
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
dominated
by
caramel
toasted
grain
and
some
floral
hops
coming
in
to
round
everything
out
the
flavor
profile
starts
out
with
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
malt
upfront
with
a
citrus
bitterness
of
grapefruit
rind
that
balances
out
the
sweetness
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
with
no
alcohol
present
as
well
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
on
this
beer
and
is
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
ever
had
from
any
brewer
calico
has
a
lot
of
character
that
other
ambers
seem
to
lack
the
bitterness
and
effervescence
of
the
body
make
it
crisp
and
clean
decent
alcohol
content
means
you
can
put
back
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
which
is
exactly
what
im
going
to
do
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
a
nice
choice
to
pound
down
when
you
want
a
beer
with
some
substance
and
a
decent
hop
presence
that
wont
try
to
knock
you
over
d
id
drink
another
if
not
for
my
general
dislike
of
cascade
beers
notes

the

flavor
is
much
the

up

with
a
generous
amount
of
northwest
hops
that
leave
a
resiny
residue
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
smooth
for
the
style
which
makes
this
beer
special
drinkability
is
near
perfect
this
is
one
of
the
better
ambers
that
i
have
had
and
it
is
well
worth
the
price
as
the
name
suggests
this
is
a
deep
copperamber
with
just
a
tinge
of
haze
and
an
offwhite
to
tan
thick
creamy
head
and
lacing
mostly
caramel
and
resin
in
the
nose
with
some
fruit
grapefruit
underneath
the
taste
is
quite
interesting
as
despite
having
almost
no
residual
malt
sweetness
combined
with
the
prevalence
of
the
hop
character
in
this
it
still
manages
to
come
off
with
the
overall
impression
of
malty
depth
and
complexity
lively
prickly
carbonation
and
a
light
to
medium
body
lead
to
a
crisp
bitter
finish
this
is
a
very
sessionable
brew
and
id
love
to
try
it
ontap
im
not
a
big
fan
of
ambers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
hops
add
a
very
nice
element
to
this
beer
without
going
overboard
this
is
another
very
enjoyable
hoppy
amber
ale
ive
had
plenty
of
the
ones
that
arent
hoppy
and
i
feel
that
this
is
the
way
to
go
plus
with
the
5
its
sessionable
recommended
d
an
excellent
american
amber
ale
with
nothing
too
out
there
but
just
a
lot
of
solid
goodness
in
delivering
a
greattasting
brew
dthis
is
not
your
typical
boring
malty
amber
this
one
has
a
very
good
malthop
balance
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
ballast
point
and
at
5
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
3
of
these
in
a
row
really
nice
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
strong
and
satisfying
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
trendy
amber
ale
genre
for
its
type
excellent
and
one
of
the
better
ambers
i
have
seen
color
is
a
deep
orangered
with
a
respectable
head
appearing
smells
of
malt
and
spice
and
tastes
moderately
of
spice
malt
and
yow
a
respectable
amount
of
hops
in
there
too
could
qualify
as
decent
apa
if
it
wanted
to
not
quite
as
much
hop
flavor
as
the
green
flash
amber
but
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
ive
had
to
date
d
excellent
brew
almost
like
a
malty

solid
offering
from

point
very
drinkable

crafted

for

carbonation
nose
was
up

with
candy

sweetness
yet
malty
anise
from

very
nice
malty
profile
with
narry
a
hop
to
be
found
the
taste
was
full
bodied
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
interesting
sweetness
at
midtongue
and
finishes
with
a
modest
hoppiness
a
winner
the
mouthfeel
was
very
balanced
and
viscous
overall
you
dont
have
to
strain
to
note
its
features
nice
strong
nose
and
taste
a
treat
d
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
amber
ale
one
of
the
hoppiest
ive
ever
had
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
may
be
one
of
the
two
best
american
amberred
ales
ive
hadright
there
with
st
rogue
and
a
close
second
among
red
ale
to
brian
boru
distinct
and
impressive
this
is
terrific
one
ill
most
certainly
grab
again
in
quantity
the
big
malt
gives
this
beer
a
slightly
bigger
body
than
average
and
this
means
a
bigger
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decent
amber
ale
a
fine
sippin
session
beer
and
it
has
a
fish
on
the
label
cmon
i
the
end
it
is
basically
a
malt
job
and
just
another
american
amber
pours
a
clear
ruby
hued
brown
with
a
creme
head
that
falls
fairly
soon
and
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
flavor
is
nice
great
earthy
tones
sweet
caramel
hits
quick
on
the
very
back
side
feel
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
good
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
amber
ale
this
is
a
really
neutral
beerthere
aint
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
its
not
complex
unique
or
unusual
this
would
fit
into
any
party
and
not
offend
anyone
except
the
most
macro

of

the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
floral
hops
and
caramel
malts
probably
leaning
more
towards
the
malty
side
of
things
a
touch
of
roasted
nutty
malt
is
also
present
the
taste
is

similar
to
the

with
the
toasted
caramel
notes
coming
through
the
strongest
nicely
balanced
initially
sweet
from
the
crystalcaramel
malts
transitions
to
a
biscuity
nutty
malt
taste
and
it
finishes
slightly
dry
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
chewy
i
would
describe
the
carbonation
as
pillowy
overall
a
drinkable
beer
not
as
impressive
as
their
ipa
was
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
d
drinkability
was
very
smooth
well
rounded
drinks
more
like
a
red
but
very
nice
going
down
and
worthy
of
a
try
a
good
beer
not
great
worth
checking
out
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
an
easy
drinking
brew
surprisingly
hoppy
for
an
amber
pretty
good
but
the
dryness
is
overpowering
in
the
long
run
good
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
drinking
ale
drinks
pretty
easy
straight
forward
enough
not
to
overpower
a
very
good
amber
pours
a
very
pretty
copper
color
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
decent
head
the
nose
is
very
green
with
hops
and
contains
a
faintly
offputting
vegetal
smell
hopefully
not
a
consistent
character
of
this
beer
on
the
palate
big
citrusy
hops
that
contain
a
surprising
amount
of
earthy
flavors
for
an
american
amber
even
though
they
finish
with
a
metallic
flourish
imbalanced
for
sure
but
it
still
has
some
enticing
biscuity
malt
flavors
the
overall
impression
though
is
of
briskness
and
zip
helping
that
last
fact
is
the
carbonation
which
has
a
brusque
steely
nature
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
solid
drinkable
rendition
of
an
american
amber
this
would
make
a
fantastic
session
brew
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
the
relatively
low
abv
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
price
is
a
bit
high
for
what
you
get
not
as
good
as
their
ipa
but
this
one
went
down
crisp
clean
and
smooth
without
any
overbearing
or
cloying
factors
overall
a
delicious
amber
ballast
point
finally
made
it
to
my
region
hopefully
i
can
retry
yellow
tail
a
beer
i
trashed
years
ago
when
i
just
started
beer
advocation
a
very
nice
drinker
for
those
of
us
who
do
not
need
turbo
beers
all
the
time
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
touch
creamy
finish
is
a
lasting
hop
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
astringency
that
lasts
a
long
time
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
amber
ale
i
like
this
one
give
it
a
try
golden
brown
with
a
head
that
starts
out
well
but
disappears
to
just
some
bubbling
after
about
14
the
way
down
smell
of
hops
seem
to
slightly
overpower
the
malt
characterictics
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
and
has
a
kind
of
green
beer
taste
between
the
other
flavors
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
few
good
amber
homebrews
ive
had
its
a
pretty
ok
brew
but
if
im
in
the
mood
for
this
ill
make
it
on
my
own
overall
easy
to
drink
a
hop
lovers
amber
i
will
be
having
this
again
not
the
best
from
ballast
point
but
not
too
bad
either
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
at
a
low
cost
average
among
the
other
red
ales
i
have
tasted
this
stuff
is
also
available
in
six
packs
and
bombers
which
is
a
plus
recommended
damn
fine
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
thier
ipa
which
is
chillin
in
my
fridge

a

malt
and
some
resin

taste
of
dirty
hops

ang
slightly
oily
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
resin
dirty
hops
and
is
short
when
poured
the
color
was
of
a
hazy
amber
with
some
foam
that
dissapated
with
in
a
few
seconds
and
some
lace
the
smell
of
spices
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
but
the
taste
was
a
disapointment
i
felt
it
was
to
bitter
and
not
enough
flavor
i
tasted
hops
though
mild
but
not
much
of
anything
else
some
spice
but
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
not
what
i
expected
not
a
first
or
second
class
ale
cant
see
what
everyone
else
sees
in
this
amber
ale
nice
amber
color
with
a
smell
of
malts
tastes
malty
cereal
delicious
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
and
my
favorite
part
about
the
beer
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
hoppier
i
would
probably
buy
sixers
of
this
if
it
were
available
a
solid
brew
starts
out
a
deep
reddishcopper
color
and
is
topped
with
a
moderate
tan
head
the
beer
laces
nicely
when
being
consumed
a
sweet
taffy
nose
is
balanced
by
malt
i
swear
an
oreo
cookie
was
dropped
into
the
mix
as
a
faint
but
definite
aroma
and
taste
of
chocolate
is
present
a
nicely
balanced
amber
ale
with
a
temperate
bitterness
making
it
a
good
drinker
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
inchthick
head
it
has
a
very
malty
aroma
kind
of
doughy
and
syrupy
theres
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
from
the
smell
i
was
guessing
id
get
a
malt
bomb
piney
flavors
are
dominant
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
dough
for
balance
it
has
a
very
viscous
feel
to
it
feeling
a
lot
heavier
than
it
tastes
this
amber
ale
leans
towards
the
hoppy
side
and
makes
a
good
alternative
to
an
ipa
im
not
sure
if
i
just
got
a
bad
one
but
that
burnt
taste
is
really
distracting
and
unappealing
too
bad
because
it
seemed
promising
from
the
look
and
aroma
with
the
taste
im
not
even
sure
if
i
can
finish
this
it
does
indeed
pour
a
gorgeous
copper
color
with
amber
highlights
smells
and
taste
is
nicely
malty
with
some
hops
this
is
certainly
no
ipa
and
fruit
flavors
mixed
in
a
good
brew
but
certainly
not
a
big
beer
by
any
means
carbonation
was
fairly
low
and
im
wondering
if
it
might
have
gone
a
bit
flat
but
judging
from
the
the
other
reviews
im
guessing
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
little
to
no
head
is
fairly
standard
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
fizzy
tan
head
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
hoppy
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyhoppy
bitter
and
some
caramel
the
finish
is
bitterdry
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
amber
from
ballast
point
pours
dark
amber
with
a
big
rocky
off
white
head
decent
lacing
but
rather
streaky
the
smell
is
a
little
odd
its
bready
and
grassy
and
with
notes
of
cilantro
and
celery
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
there
is
that
malty
breadiness
but
also
celery
seed
and
herbal
flavors
and
a
light
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
pretty
drinkable
but
i
dont
like
this
near
as
much
as
their
ipa
and
dipa
tasted
on
tap
at
ballast
points
homebrew
mart
with
a
resiny
tree
natural
scent
coming
off
of
a
clean
white
head
of
decent
size
this
beers
aromatic
qualities
set
the
stage
for
an
enjoyable
tasting
its
color
is
a
deep
red
like
dark
cherries
maybe
it
settled
nicely
in
the
glass
and
when
tasted
the
hop
flavor
and
a
certain
crispness
seemed
to
dominate
easy
to
drink
and
not
heavy
i
wouldnt
say
that
its
mouthfeel
seemed
weak
or
thin
but
that
there
was
something
missing
in
the
final
swallow
that
may
be
just
my
imagination
this
beer
was
satisfying
and
tasted
like
it
was
cared
for
regal
looking
deep
copperscarlet

thick
and

in
it
and
also
some

are
noticeable
in

kind
of
way
on
the

rich

lay
down

hops
add
some
nice

the

smooth
this
is
quite
a
nice
amber
d
this
beer
is
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
d
quite
good
a
memorable
amber
a
nice
beer
that
id
look
for
again
recommended
d
tasty
and
smooth
almost
perfect
slightly
more
hops
in
the
taste
with
some
flavor
and
bitterness
again
though
malt
is
the
focus
pretty
one
dimensional
too
which
is
what
im
really
not
a
fan
of
here
just
that
sweet
dextrinous
is
that
right
unfermented
stuff
not
like
it
has
much
depth
about
it
not
bready
or
toasty
or
yeasty
or
anything
just
a
basic
amber
ale
which
is
a
bit
boring
im
afraid
drinkability
a
very
solid
beer
in
the
american
amber
category
in
my
opinion
it
beats
fat
tire
and
stones
levitation
ale
speaking
of
stone
this
reminds
me
of
a
toneddown
10th
anniversary
ipa
after
it
has
been
aged
over
half
a
year
given
that
the
10th
anniversary
is
on
its
way
out
in
annals
of
beer
history
im
content
to
know
that
a
fairly
similiar
though
weaker
beer
is
out
there
i
imagine
this
could
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
drinkability
is
quite
good
its
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
solid
and
very
session
worthy
worth
a
try
lots
of
care
went
into
this
beer
and
it
comes
out
a
beauty
overall
very
well
brewed
with
obvious
attention
d
very
drinkable
and
solid
amber
complex
but
yet
well
balanced
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
rather
boring
it
is
not
by
any
means
bad
just
boring
i
bought
the
bottle
to
use
for
beer
chili
and
beer
cheese
dip
i
still
had
half
a
bottle
left
and
decided
to
review
it
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
started
with
a
nice
head
that
faded
pretty
quickly
the
color
of
the
beer
is
light
brown
with
an
orange
tinge
the
smell
is
floral
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
malty
with
the
hops
complimenting
nicely
and
adding
a
sensation
of
additional
sweetness
before
fading
into
a
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
the
drinkability
is
o
k
i
think
the
hop
aftertaste
clings
to
my
tongue
a
little
too
long
which
makes
the
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
struggle
to
drink
to
much
of
if
in
the
san
diego
area
id
definitely
recommend
it
as
a
quality
amber
example
for
the
local
area
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
or
so
nothing
overly
heavy
coats
the
mouthwell
but
the
flavor
doesnt
seem
to
linger
for
too
long
superb
drinkability
with
its
balanced
flavor
and
overall
good
taste
mouthfeel
isnt
too
heavy
just
a
good
beer
d
pretty
standard
ill
need
to
try
this
beer
again
i
fear
my
bottle
was
old
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
only
a
tad
bit
of
dryness
upon
swallowing
just
enough
to
make
you
want
to
take
another
sip
the
low
abv
make
this
very
sessionable
i
have
had
four
of
their
offerings
and
i
have
been
well
pleased
each
time
hopefully
they
can
increase
production
and
distribution
so
we
can
get
it
out
here
on
the
east
coast
soon
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
west
coast
breweries
now
to
trade
for
some
more
mouthfeel
is
good
well
carbonated
not
too
thick
or
thin
drinkability
is
high
i
could
put
away
a
couple
22oz
bottles
of
this
on
any
given
night
d
ive
never
had
an
amber
with
such
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
points
there
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
ill
definately
be
back
for
more
i
noticed
that
amberred
ale
is
such
a
popular
style
and
it
is
hard
to
set
a
brew
apart
from
another
without
brewing
another
style
completely
i
think
the
mouthfeel
for
brew
accomplishes
that
feat
deep
reddishamber
color
clear
with
a
slim
sustaining
head
of
off
white
froth
the
aroma
is
soft
and
sweet
dominated
by
grassy
citrus
hops
much
like
an
ipa
strong
on
taste
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
nutty
toasted
malt
the
bitterness
is
quite
strong
and
lingers
well
an
unexpected
suprise
medium
thickness
with
pretty
strong
carbonation
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
the
delectable
bitterness
very
nice
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
amber
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
maybe
one
of
my
new
favorite
amber
beers
worth
the
money
if
you
happen
to
see
it
pick
it
up
this
is
a
fabulous
example
of
an
amber
ale
hoppy
and
flavorful
like
a
hoppy
pale
ale
even
i
definitely
recommend
this
to
those
sick
of
bland
craft
brewed
amber
ales
a
22oz
of
this
beer
is
the
perfect
amount
as
well
it
allows
for
a
miniquaffing
session
which
is
what
this
beer
is
made
for
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
of
his
style
notes
wow
what
an
exceptional
offering
from
a
brewery
i
regularly
blew
past
in
the
beer
stores
six
packs
of
this
stuff
would
be
my
prefered
purchase
size
bombers
of
smallish
beers
are
not
usually
on
my
list
hopefully
this
will
be
the
next
brew
that
bp
decides
to
sell
in
6
packs
which
will
make
it
even
more
convenient
for
sessions
thanks
to
kingslender
and
the
left
coast
bas
for
so
graciously
giving
me
the
gift
of
this
bottle
upon
our
ba
meetup
at
monks
in
philly
feel
is
fairly
broad
and
boldly
set
within
a
medium
heft
lively
but
soothing
carbonation
and
definately
dry
all
over
the
place
it
has
a
good
amount
of
that
no
doubt
a
bit
one
dimensional
with
the
dry
tones
therefore
a
tad
tiresome
after
a
while
of
drinking
still
one
keeper
of
an
amber
solid
and
dry
ballast
point
calico
amber
ale
is
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
to
have
crossed
my
palate
in
quite
a
while
it
stresses
the
hoppy
side
of
its
personality
without
losing
sight
of
its
roots
this
is
a
tremendously
drinkable
beer
about
which
i
have
only
good
things
to
say
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
from
one
of
san
diegos
smaller
breweries
it
poured
a
very
nice
dark
amberbrownish
color
and
had
a
nice
slightly
off
white
head
that
was
very
dense
and
laced
my
glass
nicely
i
could
smell
this
beer
from
across
the
room
once
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
the
great
scent
of
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
earthiness
was
very
nice
the
taste
was
excelent
as
well
aided
nicely
by
a
near
perfect
mouthfeel
the
taste
was
quite
malty
but
never
cloying
and
had
a
great
carmel
flavor
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
nice
balanced
hoppy
finnish
another
quality
brew
from
ballast
point
amber
ales
arent
my
favorite
style
of
beer
in
fact
theyre
not
even
close
however
ballast

has
a
quality
attempt
at
the
style
here
easily
drinkable
smooth

enjoyable

really
thick

i
sometimes
dont

many
thanks
to
mickeymac
for

this

offering
it
was
fabulous
this
one
comes
from
a
bomber
with
the
trademark
ballast
point
gamefish
on
the
label
it
pours
a
very
eyepleasing
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
rather
quickly
but
leaves
some
lace
the
smell
is
interesting
and
hard
to
pinpoint
exactly
it
has
slight
peat
notes
reminiscent
of
a
scotch
ale
but
a
good
amount
of
hops
the
taste
although
again
hard
to
categorize
is
exceptionally
nice
flavors
of
biscuit
malt
sweetness
and
hops
blend
together
almost
perfectly

wow
do
i
like
this

the
nose
followed
shortly
by
some
soft

hops
quite
welcoming
upon
tasting

exceptionally
nice
creaminess
fills
the
mouth
due
to
the
combination
of
a
medium
body
and
moderate

citrusy

towards

and
a
bitterness
that
doesnt
interefere
with
the
maltiness
but
dries
out
the
finish
a
pleasure
that
offers
a
great
deal
of
malt
character
some
complexity
and
a
very
good
drinkability
this
is
the
first
beer
that
ive
tried
from
ballast
point
but
it
will
certainly
not
be
the
last
well
worth
trying
and
the
ship
directly
to
quite
a
few
states
this
deep
amber
colored
ale
is
quite
a
hoppy
offering
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
bittering
and
spice
hops
to
balance
out
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
not
my
favorite
amber
but
this
would
be
great
for
those
who
enjoy
a
bit
more
umph
with
their
amber
notes
a
blend
of
six
american
belgian
and
english
malts
with
the
additions
of
cascade
and
progress
hops
lend
to
the
complexity
big
malty
american
ale
well
balanced
and
well
structured
a
brew
i
could
get
real
fond
of
when
looking
for
a
malty
session
brew
o
im
a
big
fan
of
hoppy
reds
but
this
one
is
kinda
disappointing
a
bit
too
malty
for
me
despite
the
load
of
hops
my
bottle
was
pretty
fresh
and
had
bite
so
im
not
sure
how
much
has
faded
out
but
i
can
imagine
this
being
better
super
fresh
for
now
its
just
ok
a
bit
thin
and
alcoholic
for
my
tastes
overall
while
red
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
i
can
definitely
enjoy
them
although
i
do
struggle
to
review
them
as
my
palate
may
not
be
advanced
enough
to
single
out
certain
flavors
in
this
style
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
that
i
enjoyed
and
any
aficionado
of
reds
should
as
well
this
has
the
distinction
of
being
the
least
enjoyable
beer
i
have
had
this
year
despite
being
just
10
abv
it
tasted
like
pure
booze
i
could
hardly
even
taste
the
hops
and
malts
anymore
more
boozy
than
any
barleywine
quad
or
imperial
stout
ive
had
no
balance
at
all
this
beer
pretty
much
turned
me
off
on
anything
ballast
point
maybe
slightly
overdoing
it
in
the
hop
bitterness
department
good
taste
ballast
point
never
disappoints
medium
to
full
bodied
with
average
carbonation
chewy
and
has
a
long
bitter
finish
a
wonderful
hoppy
red
juicy
chewy
fullbodied
beer
its
like
hop
candy
in
a
bottle
by
the
way
the
alcohol
is
so
wonderfully
covered
i
didnt
realize
the
abv
was
so
quite
so
high
until
i
went
to
enter
the
review
incredibly
balanced
resiny
hop
flavors
and
sugary
sweet
malt
flavors
blend
together
to
provide
a
feeling
of
perfection
o
solid
imperial
red
but
i
think
its
not
as
balanced
as
it
should
be
taste
crispy
carbonation
with
a
bold
and
heavy
mouthfeel
syrupy
just
long
enough
to
be
taken
over
my
hop
bitterness
alcohol
hotness
forms
at
the
end
bitterness
malty
sweetness
carbonation
and
alcohol
all
get
a
chance
to
show
you
their
stuff
during
each
sip
it
is
a
heavy
beer
with
lots
of
medicinal
and
metallic
qualities
coming
through
the
dryness
s
pronounced
and
plays
with
the
bitterness
very
medicinal
at
the
end
a
fantastic
deep
rich
complex
and
nicely
balanced
beer
the
alcohol
content
remains
behind
the
scenes
while
the
grain
bill
and
hops
do
the
bulk
of
the
work
in
pleasing
your
senses
the
malt
sweetness
isnt
in
your
face
while
the
hop
bitterness
isnt
too
brash
if
big
bold
and
beautiful
in
a
beer
is
your
thing
then
this
is
one
to
check
out
fans
of
imperial
reds
should
find
something
to
enjoy
about
tongue
buckler
but
there
is
an
intense
bitterness
that
may
not
be
for
all
and
at
10
for
a
bomber
the
value
factor
is
on
the
low
side
i
find
the
recent
wave
of
new
england
style
hoppy
red
ales
more
to
my
liking
finding
the
simcoe
for
hopping
and
dry
hopping
more
appealing
personally
lawsons
steves
back
yard
red
ale
and
fiddlehead
ruby
claire
are
my
favorite
examples
of
this
style
id
recommend
trying
it
if
you
can
handle
a
beer
that
was
designed
to
challenge
your
palate
to
a
duel
this
is
crazy
beer
super
hoppy
and
not
sweet
at
all
like
i
often
associate
red
beers
as
being
or
at
least
ambers
which
i
expected
this
to
be
you
know
heavy
with
caramel
malts
and
overbalanced
not
the
case
this
one
stands
as
a
gnarly
big
red
ipa
super
hoppy
a
lot
of
action
on
this
one
resins
and
pine
grapefruit
peel
bitterness
and
some
of
the
alcohol
its
distinct
from
others
in
its
size
but
gentle
feel
in
its
refreshment
capacity
for
a
strong
ale
and
in
its
use
of
red
malt
to
add
character
without
sweetness
hoppy
as
can
be
but
never
harsh
just
super
intense
there
and
a
little
hard
to
drink
in
mass
quantity
but
like
all
beer
from
ballast
point
especially
the
big
strong
ones
this
is
excellent
and
original
beer
worthy
at
any
table
amazing
beer
ballast
point
keeps
me
falling
in
love
with
the
craft
every
new
beer
i
try
a
little
boozy
but
the
name
tells
no
lies
its
sticky
red
and
hop
forward
itll
warm
you
up
going
down
there
are
better
in
this
style
but
if
you
like
ballast
point
then
this
is
worthy
of
a
pick
up
pours
a
nice
red
color
nose
is
all

taste
is

on
the

i
really

v

not

this
beer
is
very
complex
and
takes
some
effort
to
chew
through
crazy
sweet
crazy
hoppy
and
crazy
bitter
however
they
dont
quite
blend
harmoniously
overall
a
nice
big
hoppy
red
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
do
people
wrangle

full

with
noticeable

warmth
fairly

would
like
to
try
another
bottle
knowing
that
its
fresh
to
see
if
its
any
different
decent
beer
overall
overall
this
beer
is
okay
there
are
some
offputting
elements
on
the
nose
that
reminds
me
of
cooking
brussel
sprouts
or
cauliflower
there
is
an
artificial
citrus
element
as
well
i
love
the
big
amber
style
of
beer
and
i
will
say
that
this
does
not
come
close
to
nugget
nectar
or
lagunitas
mondo
which
are
two
of
my
favorite
examples
overall
i
think
it
falls
short
because
it
lacks
that
clean
crisp
and
fresh
hop
character
that
the
others
have
a
pretty
decent
imperial
amber
could
be
a
little
cleaner
i
cant
decide
if
i
like
it
or
dont
like
it
but
it
certainly
is
different
this
is
also
definitely
not
a
session
beer
between
the
10
abv
and
a
22oz
sized
bottle
one
is
enough
to
start
your
head
spinning
o
recently
there
has
been
a
number
of
iras
being
released
and
this
one
is
good
but
does
not
quite
measure
up
to
some
of
the
competition
e
g
oskar
blues
overall
solid
imperial
red
not
something
id
get
often
for
8
but
a
solid
one
to
try
drinkability
solid
a
bit
heavy
handed
on
the
maltiness
not
a
favorite
overall
wonderful
west
coast
style
red
the
ample
malt
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
this
is
a
very
solid
imperial
red
ale
it
has
just
about
everything
you
can
look
for
in
the
style
its
not
flashy
or
over
the
top
but
its
traditional
and
well
crafted
a
really
smooth
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
it
was
a
good
follow
up
to
bear
republics
café
15
but
for
the
price
10
52
for
the
22

at

in

its
not
worth
it
for
me
ballast

i

again
i
had

when
i
tried
this
beer
it
wasnt
nearly
as
bitter
as
its
off
the
scale
ibu
label
description
declares
however
its
10

content
is
hidden
well
its
probably
the
smoothest

ive
ever
had
it
tastes
like
a

thats
where
this
swashbuckling

deceptively
strong
is
the
best
way
to
explain

tap
at
the
brewery
brown
cloudy
nice
big
head
tight
bubbles
that
continued
forever
its
an
imperial
red
according
to
the
brewery
aroma
and
taste
profile
was
hoppy
pretty
fruity
initial
taste
then
it
starts
tasting
like
a
lager
its
meh
another
blast
from
the
past
that
i
reacquired
great
stuff
a
hybrid
red
that
is
great
with
many
seafood
yes
i
said
it
dishes
no
bottle
date
reviewed
as
is
more
like
a
brown
ale
kind
of
a
washed
out
finish
just
the
right
amount
of
malthopsabv
taste
my
go
to
beer
when
i
want
something
good
great
finish
mixed
six
from
uncle
mike
its
an
outstanding
beer
smooth
and
tasty
one
of
my
new
favorites
pairs
well
with
steak
this
is
a
lightbodied
beer
with
a
nice
amber
hew
it
drinks
much
lighter
than
i
would
expect
by
looking
at
the
color
the
beer
has
no
discernible
hop
aroma
and
the
finish
is
very
short
i
think
its
just
an
easytodrink
everyday
type
of
beer
i
have
had
pilsner
with
more
body
but
hey
you
can
get
this
pretty
inexpensively
i
paid
12
99
for
a
12pack
classic
craft
beer
awesome
drinkability
pours
from
the
bottle
a
reddish
amber
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
haze
caramel
malts
and
leather
are
present
in
the
aroma
it
tastes
almost
exactly
as
it
smells
sweetness
and
spice
followed
by
a
touch
of
bitterness
medium
mouth
with
a
bit
of
oil
a
decent
enough
brew
but
nothing
remarkable
pours
a
slightly
clouded
ruddy
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
starts
to
develop
a
bit
as
it
warms
with
light
sweet
malt
aspects
unfortunately
the
taste
remains
pretty
lackluster
with
just
some
nondescript
sweetness
and
a
little
earthy
quality
the
body
does
have
a
nice
weight
and
feeling
to
it
on
the
palate
lighter
and
smooth
this
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
tried
back
in
early
2000s
and
unfortunately
it
hasnt
held
up
in
comparison
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
bit
of
dryness
to
it
the
feel
is
nicely
balanced
as
just
enough
is
taken
from
the
sweetness
its
plenty
crisp
and
its
clean
getting
pretty
smooth
from
middle
to
finish
the
price
is
what
is
greatest
between
obamas
america
and
his
hidden
inflation
and
the
current
trend
of
craft
brews
escalating
in
price
this
is
a
much
welcomed
sensibility
priced
every
day
bargain
pearl
of
a
brew
had
this
on
cask
at
the
local
pub
it
was
the
2nd
day
of
the
cask
had
a
nice
head
to
it
the
aroma
was
slight
caramel
and
oats
the
oatmeal
taste
was
fantastic
cask
is
the
best
way
to
enjoy
this
stout
it
really
brings
out
the
taste
had
this
on
bottle
once
and
thought
it
was
just
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
cask
makes
all
the
difference
i
picked
up
a
growler
of
red
tail
ale
from
minogues
beverage
in
queensbury
ny
this
is
a
very
good
ale
with
a
bold
taste
unforunately
the
keg
kicked
as
my
growler
was
being
filled
it
definately
tasted
better
at
mendocinos
tasting
room
in
saratoga
springs
ny
i
highly
reccomend
a
trip
there
still
it
was
a
good
beer
at
a
very
good
price
a
quality
beer
brewed
local
in
saratoga
ny
amber
ale
with
a
hint
smell
of
alcohol
and
then
hops
the
same
is
with
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
tasted
first
followed
by
malted
finish
i
enjoy
this
amber
ale
i
am
not
sure
if
the
alcohol
percentage
is
correct
because
it
is
more
like
a
strong
ale
i
do
recommend
this
beer
great
red
ale
smooth
consistency
flavorful
good
after
taste
drank
it
in
a
pint
glass
i
prefer
to
let
the
beer
breathe
a
bit
typically
mendocino
has
great
beers
lucky
for
me
there
is
a
brewery
that
bottles
and
fills
kegs
for
them
20
minutes
down
the
road
overall
very
good
although
nothing
outstanding
if
you
live
in
the
east
this
beer
is
brewed
in
saratoga
springs
ny
so
it
is
viewed
as
a
local
brew
for
those
of
us
who
live
in
upstate
ny
despite
the
dark
red
color
the
flavor
is
close
to
that
of
a
pale
ale
a
little
more
hops
would
have
made
it
more
interesting
in
my
opinion
id
be
pleased
to
drink
it
again
overall
not
bad
for
a
buck
i
really
like
the
color
the
taste
is
not
a
standout
but
not
bad
the
first
time
i
had
any
beer
from
mendocino
was
when
i
went
to
their
brewery
in
saratoga
i
tried
many
of
the
beers
they
had
on
tap
but
this
one
stood
out
from
the
rest
it
had
a
good
clean
taste
with
lots
of
bite
not
overpowering
like
some
red
ales
can
get
they
tend
to
get
a
little
sweet
almost
like
wine
this
ale
however
had
a
fresh
taste
clean
after
taste
and
smooth
texture
beer
of
the
mont
club
pours
clear
reddish
orange
with
very
small
white
head
aroma
of
cherries
malt
spice
yeast
meh
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
some
honey
flavor
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
flavors
here
malt
extract
not
bad
i
guess
but
would
not
seek
out
on
my
own
medium
carbonation
with
a
mediocre
mouthfeel
goes
down
easy
enough
but
wont
have
it
again
worth
trying
a
single
oncenot
greatnot
horrible
very
unique
and
flavorful
beer
sort
of
a
hoppy
red
with
a
roasted
malty
backbone
and
tons
of
yeast
character
while
its
something
i
would
definitely
drink
again
its
not
a
perfect
anytime
beer
or
even
a
special
occasion
brew
its
good
for
those
times
you
want
something
just
a
little
heavier
than
your
standard
pale
ale
it
does
however
have
that
special
wow
factor
that
makes
a
beer
noteworthy
and
for
that
i
recommend
it
overall
nothing
at
all
special
or
remarkable
about
this
one
its
average
across
the
board
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
decent
not
really
outstanding
in
any
way
a
solid
brew
maybe
if
you
paired
with
specific
food
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
thats
two
award
winning
brews
from
this
brewery
that
i
thought
were
not
deserving
of
any
kind
of
awards
o
good
i
would
drink
again
but
not
seek
out
o
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
very
balanced
the
verdict
not
bad
a
solid
amberred
ale
with
good
balance
and
nearperfect
appearance
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
picking
up
a
six
pack
on
the
way
home
i
dont
want
to
oversell
it
because
im
not
in
love
with
it
it
just
has
a
classic
taste
the
smell
is
lacking
and
theres
an
aftertaste
that
im
not
enjoying
the
head
started
out
nice
and
foamy
but
fades
away
to
just
a
thin
lace
but
with
good
carbonation
overall
after
such
a
tremendous
start
the
appearance
of
the
goldenbrown
ale
and
the
wonderful
smell
i
was
unimpressed
when
i
tasted
it
its
dry
simple
and
underwhelming
personally
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
notes
nicely
drinkable
with
a
good
malt
backbone
and
finish
cheers
a
nice
enough
beer
i
just
thought
i
would
like
it
more
than
i
actually
did
do
this
beer
is
an
icon
of
american
craft
brewing
a
holdover
from
a
time
when
amber
ales
were
considered
progressive
it
embraces
its
english
heritage
with
some
acuity
demonstrated
mainly
in
the
hearty
smell
it
is
no
ballast
point
calico
amberthe
beer
that
exemplifies
this
underwhelming
style
better
than
practically
any
otherbut
it
retains
some
enduring
appeal
in
its
traditional
qualities
feel
and
finish
toe
the
line
as
well
with
a
biscuity
feel
and
a
lingering
though
subtle
caramel
presence
overall
more
enjoyable
than
the
cloyingly
sweet
beverage
i
seem
to
recall
yet
a
bit
of
a
stretch
for
an
amber
and
simply
called
an
ale
on
the
label
o

nice
drinkable
medium
bodied
beer
o
solid
effort
very
drinkable
beer
with
good
balance
cheers
i
am
surprised
by
some
of
the
low
rating
here
yes
this
is
one
of
the
old
microbrews
but
it
remains
a
very
solid
amber
ale
okay
and
reasonably
drinkable
but
totally
unremarkable
which
in
an
increasingly
crowded
and
competitive
market
looks
negligent
cant
help
thinking
these
guys
were
one
of
the
first
kids
on
the
us
craft
block
and
are
now
being
left
in
the
dust
the
flavor
has
a
mild
bitterness
with
a
sharp
rough
end
around
the
finish
i
get
some
bitter
orangey
hop
flavors
as
well
as
an
offputting
taste
that
i
cant
quite
place
its
off
but
not
in
the
bad
batch
sense
perhaps
its
an
old
bottle
this
beer
failed
to
excite
this
is
a
decent
if
runofthemill
amber
ale
for
a
time
it
was
one
of
the
better
drafts
at
a
local
pub
which
isnt
saying
much
but
ive
had
it
a
few
times
as
a
result
there
is
a
notable
hop
presence
nothing
too
pungent
and
a
fair
balance
overall
but
afterward
you
wont
remember
too
much
of
it
a
very
nostalgic
beer
for
many
people
thinner
body
excellent
caramel
malt
character
with
a
mild
frontofthetongue
hop
spice
to
balance
it
out
very
floral
would
compliment
a
hearty
steak
or
a
day
at
the
beach
a
classic
and
a
staple
in
the
american
craft
brewing
renaissance
a
nice
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
pours
out
a
slightly
hazed
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
foamy
head
that
lasts
for
about
a
minute
leaving
mediocre
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
smells
like
a
lemon
orange
peel
hopping
laying
over
a
lightly
toasted
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
raisins
a
really
nice
aroma
profile
however
the
flavor
is
a
lot
less
pronounced
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
but
contained
exactly
the
same
elements
a
little
bit
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
body
but
has
adequate
carbonation
to
move
it
around
in
the
mouth
still
it
could
stand
to
be
a
hair
thinner
in
consistency
id
like
to
see
a
smoother
finish
otherwise
pretty
good
rjt
o
very
drinkable
pretty
middleoftheroad
for
the
style
overall
10
years
ago
this
was
the
first
amber
ale
id
ever
tried
and
its
the
best
amber
ale
ive
ever
had
to
date
the
industry
standard
try
it
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
produced
a
white
head
very
nice
retention
and
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
amber
ale
consists
of
pale
malted
grain
and
citrus
it
reminds
me
of
an
apa
medium
in
body
this
beer
has
a
toasted
malt
profile
caramel
and
a
nice
citric
hop
flavor
semi
dry
finish
excellent
session
beer
well
balanced
prost
overall
this
is
a
solid
red
ale
from
mendocino
its
not
the
most
complex
or
interesting
beer
but
its
got
character
anyone
just
getting
into
craft
brews
shouldnt
have
any
trouble
cutting
their
teeth
on
this
one
great
session
beer
if
you
have
the
chance
to
have
this
on
cask
which
is
unlikely
if
youre
not
from
the
capital
region
of
ny
do
it
an
easy
drinker
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
session
beer
nothing
special
here
a
bit
of
disappointment
in
the
taste
and
aroma
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
and
found
it
hard
to
finish
and
i
will
definitely
be
avoiding
it
in
the
future
definitely
a
solid
selection
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
amber
this
was
a
pivotal
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
brewing
but
after
several
years
ive
found
better
american
ambers
and
pale
ales
its
not
bad
by
any
means
and
stands
as
a
very
humble
beer
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
a
great
gateway
beer
to
get
people
to
try
craft
beer
but
there
are
definitely
more
balanced
more
presentable
beers
in
this
variety
overall
this
is
a
decent
amber
ale
that
is
very
representative
of
the
styles
origins
although
its
not
a
great
beer
i
come
back
to
it
more
than
i
should
because
it
was
a
gateway
beer
for
me
to
the
craft
beer
world
so
i
have
a
sentimental
spot
in
my
palate
for
this
brew
simple
straightforward
and
generally
enjoyable
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
waited
a
while
before
trying
it
and
definitely
would
buy
this
one
again
i
have
to
say
that
i
liked
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
was
going
to
serving
type
bottle
d
ok
i
guess
but
kinda
heavy
bitterer
than
expected
o
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
buttery
aspect
in
this
one
this
isnt
really
a
characteristic
i
look
for
in
an
amber
this
and
the
muted
malt
and
hop
characters
are
what
brought
this
one
down
overall
drinkability
reasonably
flavorful
and
complex
for
the
style
other
than
some
minor
flaws
such
as
the
ill
fitting
metallic
and
astringent
characters
this
is
a
pretty
legitimate
beer
for
using
as
a
session
or
a
tasting
not
the
most
amazing
beer
due
to
the
off
characters
but
definitely
worth
a
try
the
feel
of
this
beer
has
a
smoothness
that
is
pleasant
as
it
goes
down
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
with
a
slight
aftertaste
that
is
there
just
briefly
red
tail
ale
is
a
red
ale
from
mendocino
brewing
co
in
northern
california
it
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
light
lacing
the
aroma
was
mild
almost
nonexistent
with
mild
hops
and
a
faint
citrus
smell
the
feel
is
pleasant
and
the
taste
is
unassuming
somewhat
dry
with
a
hops
finish
not
my
favorite
ale
and
its
probably
just
personal
preference
but
i
prefer
my
ales
with
a
bit
more
hops
overall
a
solid
brew
though
and
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
them
this
beer
pours
a
striking
copper
color
with
thin
head
and
no
lace
its
aroma
is
a
bit
citrussy
with
malt
sweetness
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
caramel
with
spice
and
root
beer
notes
it
starts
smooth
leaving
a
mildly
bitter
aftertase
as
it
warms
the
caramel
fades
and
the
hop
bitterness
pushes
through
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
mendocino
red
tail
ale
is
an
okay
beer
slightly
recommended
pours
a
murky
copper
amber
color
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
that
had
tight
bubbles
the
smell
is
mostly
dried
fruit
with
a
background
of
sweet
caramel
malt
an
unexpected
bitterness
hits
you
first
tasting
of
lemony
hops
there
are
hints
of
apricot
and
caramel
with
toasted
malt
and
a
grassy
hop
finish
its
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
lingering
finish
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
brew
drinkable
on
any
occasion
pours
to
a
thin
bubbly
head
and
hazy
orangered
color
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
toastandjam
with
some
hops
in
the
background
flavor
is

with
more
of
a
caramel
and
fruit
flavor
with
a
nice
charge
of
hops
to
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
moderate
co2
overall
this
is
a
solid
tasty
offering
this
sample
was
brewed
in
saratoga
springs
ny
m
easy
start
that
gets
complicated
at
the
end
changing
from
a
balanced
neutral
sensation
to
a
lasting
bitterness
body
is
not
to
thick
so
it
is
found
refreshing
tangy
bready
malt
some
mellow
dry
bitterness
and
pine
notes
mild
sweetness
medium
bodied
easy
enough
to
drink
fairly
simple
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
character
and
mild
malt
complexity
seems
fresher
on
tap
than
when
i
last
had
a
bottle
cliche
i
know
o
pretty
good
amber
ale
the
taste
seemed
a
little
off
but
overall
it
was
very
good
o
i
would
give
it
a
5
out
of
10
its
bitter
sour
and
just
unpleasant
maybe
its
just
me
but
this
is
a
beer
i
would
definitely
pass
on
in
the
future
revisiting
one
of
my
earlier
craft
encounters
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
dusty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
mandarin
orange
skin
light
lemon
rind
and
a
few
drops
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
focuses
a
bit
more
on
the
citrus
than
the
sweets
but
not
by
all
that
much
other
than
that
things
are
pretty
much
the
same
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
amber
nothing
amazing
but
a
good
everyday
beer
possibility
pours
a
cheerful
orange
with
a
tight
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
lemony
slightly
sour
the
flavor
is
lemony
and
tart
with
a
bit
of
peach
and
other
stonefruit
there
is
a
strawlike
malt
with
a
overripe
floral
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
crisp
and
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
sour
f
some
sweet
notes
some
citrics
mal
flavour
hop
bitternessdry
finish
long
end
medium
body
and
some
crisp
on
tongue
final
thought
this
is
a
nice
ale
nice
price
at
7
and
a
decent
6
3
abv
serving
type
bottle
overall
its
far
from
a
succession
ale
but
not
very
off
putting
a
decent
red
ale
overall
not
too
much
complexity
in
this
brew
the
flagship
offering
from
mendocino
brewing
company
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
amber
though
you
could
do
worse
ive
been
away
from
this
too
long
ill
be
buying
again
overall
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
good
full
bodied
beer
but
didnt
deliver
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
standard
amberish
red
like
most
of
this
style
the
head
was
a
light
yellow
it
smelled
kinda
hoppy
and
sweet
the
taste
was
average
it
had
some
hoppiness
and
a
decent
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
dry
in
the
aftertaste
overall
is
was
ok
lots
of
malt
in
the
taste
some
sournessin
the
the
sixpack
i
bought
one
bottle
seemed
particularly
sour
caramel
flavour
dry
finnish
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
even
at
6
i
could
see
this
as
a
nice
backyard
session
ale
overall
this
ale
isnt
super
exciting
but
it
does
satisfy
my
craving
for
a
decent
craft
beer
a
good
alternative
to
hoppy
pale
ales
notes
theres
not
too
much
to
say
its
a
good
basic
amber
ale
its
not
mind
blowing
but
it
is
still
a
decent
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
slightly
cloudy
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
on
top
no
lace
left
behind
the
nose
is
really
mild
for
the
style
some
wet
grains
floral
tones
and
honeylike
sweetness
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
carbonated
well
easydrinker
at
the
first
fews
sips
this
beer
carries
a
worthy
amount
of
bitterness
but
as
i
continue
to
sip
this
fades
really
tame
flavors
as
well
caramellike
flavors
grassy
notes
and
a
bready
finish
the
way
this
presents
itself
id
say
this
is
more
characteristic
of
a
pale
ale
or
something
of
the
sort
an
easydrinking
beer
though
one
i
could
reach
for
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
nononsense
thirstquenching
simple
ale
and
in
that
mood
i
was
today
t
this
is
gross
funky
not
in
a
good
way
and
metallic
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
this
is
pretty
awful
though
pouring
the
rest
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
but
aint
going
to
spend
my
money
on
it
nice
gateway
brew
nothing
more
nothing
less
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
extremely
hazy
and
pale
dull
colored
the
color
is
a
muddy
copper
with
a
half
inch
tight
bubbled
off
white
head
aroma
is
musty
slightly
sour
and
it
was
hard
to
get
much
more
than
that
because
all
the
scents
were
muted
flavors
are
also
muted
and
riding
a
light
watery
body
toasted
malt
and
caramelly
notes
briefly
present
the
aftertaste
is
musty
and
a
little
fruity
and
the
finish
lasts
too
long
for
what
it
offers
which
isnt
much
after
reading
some
previous
reviews
i
cannot
understand
why
reviewers
will
describe
beer
flavors
as
muddled
and
oversweet
and
will
avoid
then
give
b
and
b
drinkability
this
beer
was
alright
not
the
best
and
far
from
the
worst
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
but
after
a
couple
i
would
probably
move
on
to
something
else
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
it
up
d
the
flavors
muddle
into
a
mess
and
i
would
probably
avoid
this
beer
again
final
notes
a
really
good
beer
in
its
own
right
that
said
this
is
most
certainly
not
an
amber
ale
and
it
really
needs
to
be
reclassified
as
an
apa
it
doesnt
have
the
sweet
chewy
caramel
goodness
and
yeasty
middle
of
an
amber
so
as
such
i
have
to
rate
this
beer
low
d
not
something
i
would
order
again
just
okay
example
of
the
style
which
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
not
too
heavy
in
any
way
but
not
interesting
enough
to
bring
me
back
light
amber
with
a
subtle
cloudiness
good
looking
tan
foam
cap
of
about
an
each
decent
retention
and
lacing
balanced
nose
with
grain
and
some
biscuit
malt
touch
of
fruity
hops
tastes
grainy
and
biscuity
in
the
front
with
a
bitter
herbal
finish
that
also
brings
some
cookie
and
metallic
notes
medium
to
light
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
while
this
is
inarguably
a
classic
beer
it
is
decidedly
average
in
todays
world
if
a
new
craft
brewery
made
this
it
would
be
completely
ignored
value
excellent
for
what
you
get
d
delicious
drinkability
the
hops
on
the
after
taste
qualms
my
urges
for
an
ipa
im
a
hop
head
sweetness
is
not
overwhelming
the
hops
are
light
but
present
definitely
drinkable
first
off
the
chemical
taste
is
the
alcohol
from
the
fermented
malts
i
dont
know
what
kind
they
use
but
it
sure
does
hit
the
spot
this
is
a
great
session
beer
its
kinda
like
a
calmer
eye
of
the
hawk
which
is
super
strong
and
has
more
hop
flavor
this
beer
doesnt
have
too
much
flavor
its
just
a
great
beer
i
wish
it
had
more
carbonation
drink
this
one
super
cold
super
refreshing
and
not
too
bitter
despite
the
sweet
and
sour
aftertaste
pick
it
up
bright
ruby
red
body
slightly
hazed
when
held
toward
the
light
fine
off
white
cream
colored
head
leaves
behind
fine
speckled
lacing
aroma
has
caramelraisinhints
of
faint
alcohol
flavor
a
sweet
and
dry
mixture
of
chemicalsphenolic
flavors
and
bitter
background
hops
wrapped
around
caramel
flavored
hops
a
bit
abrasive
as
a
whole
this
is
not
the
beer
i
recall
years
ago
when
i
tasted
red
tail
ale
things
have
gone
in
a
bad
direction
eversince
they
were
bought
by
the
kingfisher
indian
mogul
mouthfeel
is
cloying
with
earthy
bitterness
body
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
doesnt
carry
things
well
just
an
unpleasant
experience
drain
pour
theres
too
many
good
beers
in
life
to
settle
for
crap
like
this
honestly
bad
flavor
and
i
will
look
for
my
next
beer
nicely
drinkable
for
a
6
beer
would
like
it
to
finish
a
bit
dryer
but
all
in
all
not
too
shabby
d
this
can
be
considered
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
given
its
wellbalanced
taste
d
i
would
definitely
refill
this
growler
and
pick
up
another
after
that
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
an
average
offwhite
head
that
mostly
diminished
and
left
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
roasted
and
nutty
malts
earthy
hops
light
to
moderate
earthy
yeast
citrus
some
other
fruitiness
and
tea
the
initial
flavor
was
acidic
and
lightly
sweet
while
the
finish
was
sweet
acidic
and
a
little
bitter
there
was
caramel
cookie
citrus
earthiness
toasted
malt
an
little
fruit
and
tea
the
light
to
medium
body
was
watery
then
dry
with
tingly
carbonation
and
a
slightly
metallic
lightly
astringent
and
dry
finish
d
very
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
this
is
a
solid
amberred
ale
but
there
are
definitely
better
ones
out
there
overall
this
one
lacks
a
bit
of
the
flavor
and
complexity
of
other
beers
in
the
category
and
it
comes
off
a
little
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
still
you
could
do
much
worse
a
little
bit
of
polish
and
this
one
could
really
shine
great
aroma
on
this
one
the
taste
isnt
as
good
the
smell
it
has
some
artificiallike
flavors
going
on
easy
drinking
though
d
a
very
nice
beer
with
surprisingly
strong
flavor
d
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
and
its
not
too
hard
to
find
them
i
did
buy
this
at
a
store
thats
known
for
carrying
old
beer
hopefully
thats
not
the
case
here
ill
have
to
try
a
less
suspect
bottle
some
time
in
the
near
future
to
see
if
thats
the
case
drinkabilitythis
beer
has
a
high
driwnkability
but
is
rather
low
on
enjoyability
as
well
not
a
normal
amber
as
ot
is
too
dry
and
thi
overall
its
quite
forgettable
super
easy
to
drink
the
balance
and
the
way
the
malts
hit
first
followed
by
the
hops
makes
you
want
to
grab
another
sip
right
away
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
low
abv
allows
you
to
enjoy
a
few
while
watching
your
favorite
sport
team
another
good
beer
from
california
red
tail
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
thats
just
off
white
there
is
no
real
notice
scent
to
it
and
much
like
the
smell
is
the
tatse
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
malts
but
it
is
quite
simple
and
makes
for
some
very
easy
drinking
great
drinkability
but
needs
a
more
complex
taste
d
extremely
drinkable
the
flavors
could
be
a
bit
stronger
but
nice
complexity
and
balance
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
the
beer
overall
is
nice
and
smooth
quite
drinkable
but
i
think
i
prefer
their
stout
and
strong
ale
a
bit
more
note
there
are
allot
of
good
amber
ales
out
there
but
i
consider
this
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
extremely
reliable
and
consistent
with
its
quality
whether
you
are
at
a
bbq
a
party
or
just
relaxing
at
home
enjoying
a
couple
beers
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
very
drinkable
and
while
not
really
my
style
i
think
this
has
the
makings
of
a
nice
session
amber
i
pretty
much
bought
this
solely
because
the
name
rang
a
bell
and
it
turned
out
not
to
be
too
bad
of
a
pickup
d
the
thinner
body
and
low
abv
make
it
very
drinkable
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
good
so
i
dont
really
want
to
have
that
many
a
medium
ale
if
the
moment
does
not
call
for
hoppy
or
black
and
robust
d
maybe
i
got
an
old
one
but
i
didnt
like
this
one
much
the
smell
and
the
flavors
seem
muted
and
stale
and
the
appearance
is
pretty
dull
as
well
its
drinkable
enough
to
put
down
a
couple
pints
over
a
meal
but
no
more
because
the
flavors
are
just
so
bland
i
might
try
once
more
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
old
but
as
for
now
i
dont
recommend
it
pass
d
good
drinkablility
thats
about
the
only
positive
dont
get
this
beer
its
more
of
a
pale
than
a
red
d
one
of
the
best
ambers
ive
had
d
the
fresh
crystal
malt
and
soft
diacetyl
butter
adds
some
nice
depth
and
interest
to
the
malt
the
juicy
full
but
not
really
bitter
hops
work
great
this
is
very
quaftable
and
the
hops
and
malt
work
great
together
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
the
other
night
nice
thicker
ale
pretty
thick
in
taste
as
well
lots
of
hop
taste
though
well
blended
nice
late
summer
afternoon
beer
to
throw
back
on
the
porch
not
as
good
as
alot
fo
the
thing
ive
had
that
had
come
out
of
the
brewery
but
all
in
all
its
worth
a
shot
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
funny
back
in
the
day
i
thought
this
was
a
heavy
beer
as
for
the
drinkability
i
could
drink
it
all
day
because
it
is
so
watered
down
that
its
not
going
to
do
much
other
then
make
you
drunk
being
open
minded
i
will
give
mendocino
at
least
one
more
chance
and
see
how
they
make
ales
that
i
am
more
likely
to
enjoy
but
this
one
i
will
continue
to
avoid
i
liked
this
beer
at
the
very
start
but
things
went
south
way
too
quickly
the
lameass
contract
not
all
im
not
pigeonholing
here
but
yall
know
what
i
mean
skankiness
a
little
too
prevalent
a
little
too
tight
no
real
hoppiness
and
a
sweetness
without
justifiable
offset
meh
d
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
i
could
see
knocking
back
a
few
with
a
reasonable
abv
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
has
some
nice
complexities
about
it
not
quite
great
but
still
an
enjoyable
drink
d
drinkable
but
not
exactly
a
mindblowing
beer
d
an
ok
beer
i
made
my
way
through
the
bottle
with
relative
ease
but
not
one
ill
be
picking
up
again
slainte
good
alcohol
but
not
a
good
enough
taste
to
be
very
drinkable
taste
is
slightly
sweet
cherries
and
orange
starts
too
sweet
for
me
but
the
hops
catch
up
and
leave
a
dry
bitter
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
nice
consistencynot
too
thick
or
thin
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
thats
a
subjective
element
this
bottle
is
not
too
far
from
my
neck
of
the
woods
and
it
tastes
fresh
fresh
fresh
drinkability
for
me
was
above
average
but
not
excellent
it
was
easy
for
me
to
drink
but
not
incredibly
easy
drinkability
this
is
an
easydrinking
beer
and
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
found
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
try
again
sometime
just
to
revisit
this
offering
a
little
disappointed
with
this
to
be
honest
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
deep
rich
amber
tone
but
otherwise
pretty
nondistinct
nose
the
same
nice
full
flavor
nothing
particularly
outstanding
but
allaround
pretty
good
balance
of
malt
and
hop
components
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
served
from
bottle
into
a
samuel
smith
euro
pint
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
quickly
subsides
to
a
minimal
amount
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
present
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
the
flavor
was
of
light
malt
and
a
little
bitter
upon
sitting
in
your
mouth
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
smooth
brew
that
could
be
consumed
on
a
large
scale
and
be
enjoyed
by
the
masses
however
its
flavors
and
aroma
are
not
enough
and
it
could
be
a
little
more
complex
to
make
it
awesome
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
although
this
version
was
made
in
sarasota
springs
new
york
this
should
be
considered
in
the
same
class
as
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
and
anchor
steam
as
a
legendary
west
coast
recipe
drinkability
i
am
actually
surprised
i
got
through
this
beer
this
is
the
second
mendocino
brewing
company
beer
i
have
had
that
has
been
a
major
disappointment
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
figure
out
whether
the
bottle
i
am
drinking
is
just
really
old
or
if
this
beer
really
is
this
bad
tastes
like
sweaty
acidic
malt
mouthfeel
is
watery
tastes
like
lagery
grain
and
is
not
pleasant
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
nice
but
fairly
average
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
wasnt
enjoyable
enough
to
make
me
want
another
mouthfeel
like
many
mendo
beers
gets
a
little
heavier
towards
the
end
drinkable
session
ale
a
keeper
it
could
be
more
maltier
a
bit
of
raw
seedy
bitterness
poured
out
a
pale
amber
into
my
glass
no
head
to
speak
of
and
the
nose
was
lacking
some
malt
notes
but
not
much
else
taste
was
standard
maybe
a
bit
bland
mouthfeel
was
standard
as
well
overall
average
or
a
bit
below
not
much
even
to
comment
on
actually
d
easy
to
throw
back
goes
down
smooth
and
could
easily
do
a
sixer
flavor
isnt
the
best
but
its
a
nice
dinner
beer
d
mmmmno
pretty
much
a
uniformly
bad
representation
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
disappointing
i
expected
a
lot
more
hops
to
come
into
play
but
it
just
didnt
happen
d
not
much
in
terms
of
flavor
but
a
decent
drinkable
beer
nothing
that
i
would
get
again
the
last
beer
to
try
out
of
my
sampler
pack
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
all
citrus
hops
with
loads
of
grapefruit
and
some
faint
pine
notes
and
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
after
a
slightly
water
start
the
middle
is
very
crisp
with
nicely
balanced
bitterness
before
you
really
start
tasting
the
malt
on
the
back
end
the
finish
is
fairly
fast
with
some
lasting
mild
bitterness
and
body
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
my
second
favorite
out
of
the
sampler
pack
very
drinkable
alcohol
wasnt
really
noticeable
until
it
had
warmed
quite
a
bit
i
could
definitely
make
this
a
go
to
beer
would
likely
accompany
lots
of
foods
very
well
buy
again
no
i
think
id
rather
have
a
beer
that
tastes
like
nothing
than
have
big
flavor
thats
bad
this
beer
is
obviously
not
a
standout
among
its
peers
by
reviews
but
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
it
came
from
a
bad
batch
of
the
three
mendocino
beers
ive
had
eye
of
the
hawk
was
mediocre
at
best
white
hawk
was
quite
good
and
red
tail
was
terrible
pretty
inconsistent
the
brewerys
beers
arent
readily
available
in
my
area
but
i
probably
wouldnt
be
buying
much
of
them
if
they
were
i
try
to
be
objective
and
constructive
but
what
gives
if
mendocino
brewing
has
been
at
this
game
since
1983
then
they
should
hang
it
up
or
supply
their
ales
with
that
certain
herb
ubiquitous
to
that
region
maybe
then
i
could
enjoy
this
or
at
least
not
know
the
difference
purchased
at
the
navy
club
in
seoul
korea
poured
into
a
lager
glass
nice
1
inch
head
that
dissipated
in
about
2
minutes
not
too
carbonated
smell
is
citrusy
hops
and
caramel
malt
nice
reddish
brown
color
nice
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
red
ale
i
like
the
hops
and
this
does
hops
pretty
well
unfortunately
after
about
6
of
them
my
head
felt
a
little
off
kilter
still
i
may
try
again
only
in
lesser
quantity
drinkability
overall
a
decent
choice
this
beer
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
although
it
does
remind
me
of
more
of
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
drinkability
an
average
amber
that
is
slightly
on
the
hoppy
side
if
you
love
hops
this
might
be
for
you
i
think
this
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
i
will
pass
in
the
future
notes
this
is
just
a
mild
amber
ale
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
low
of
flavor
the
sweet
malt
reminds
me
of
cheap
european
beer
too
so
that
really
detracts
if
you
dont
like
the
hops
that
this
company
uses
you
wont
like
any
of
their
beer
quite
a
tasty
and
sessionable
beer
offering
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
entertaining
while
a
low
enough
abv
to
have
a
couple
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
body
is
a
bit
light
not
watery
though
good
carbonation
adds
crispness
to
a
dry
feel
and
chalky
finish
its
easy
to
drink
and
looks
good
but
man
add
some
flavor
give
it
to
your
newbie
friends
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
amber
brown
color
about
12
inch
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
good
lacing
the
nose
is
predominately
caramel
malts
tastes
just
like
it
smells
with
mostly
caramel
on
the
front
end
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
to
finish
it
is
light
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
and
kind
of
a
middle
of
the
road
amber
not
bad
but
nothing
special
shows
an
orangishamber
in
the
glass
with
a
white
froth
decent
head
retention
and
decent
lacing
aromas
of
caramel
light
grassy
hops
lemon
light
cocoa
subtle
chap
stick
like
skunkiness
subtle
roastiness
follow
through
on
the
flavor
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
leanwater
with
a
balanced
hop
bitterness
and
a
decent
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
beer
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
and
with
some
alcohol
warming
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
smooth
this
is
a
good
beer
despite
the
lacking
head
i
went
to
a
beer
festival
off
of
lake
george
in
upstate
ny
this
is
my
first
beerfestokcoberfest
hope
i
spelled
right
ha
anyway
this
beer
was
the
clear
winner
of
all
of
them
it
smells
like
sugar
i
like
sugar
the
taste
is
equally
surprising
the
taste
is
sweetbeer
and
i
dont
know
how
they
made
it
but
its
freakin
good
i
consider
myself
to
be
a
hop
head
and
this
beer
was
a
groundbreaker
iow
i
highly
recommend
8222012
decided
that
the
first
time
i
had
this
there
was
definitively
something
wrong
this
time
it
was
a
lot
better
overall
a
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
it
with
some
italian
beef
and
a
side
of
potatoes
drinkabilitiy
pretty
good
given
the
style
id
like
a
little
more
hops
sweetness
takes
away
slightly
from
drinkability
like
my
other
review
of
an
obviously
ruined
beer
i
know
the
beer
should
be
better
and
would
gladly
change
the
score
if
i
could
find
a
good
bottle
however
my
bad
bottle
wasnt
the
only
one
on
the
site
so
buyer
beware
drinkability
4

0
would
definitely
buy
again
found
it
in
abq
at
trader
joes
the
taste
is
very
full
palated
malt
some
very
slight
chicory
bark
flavors
characteristic
of
a
red
ale
there
are
also
some
sourdough
malts
underneath
the
malts
tip
the
scale
more
than
the
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
a
drying
leafy
slight
spicey
hop
presence
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
nice
red
ale
the
ever
so
slight
chicory
bark
is
a
nice
touch
and
adds
character
to
the
beer
overall
a
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
as
malty
as
i
expect
from
an
amber
it
is
missing
those
nice
buiscut
notes
from
munich
malts
frankly
i
would
liken
this
more
to
some
of
the
copper
ales
out
there
d
the
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
overpowering
it
sort
of
takes
over
this
ale
d
easy
enough
to
get
down
because
its
relatively
weak
no
real
desire
to
have
this
again
t
its
a
dry
ale
its
malty
but
not
a
good
malt
almost
a
sour
malt
the
flavor
is
minimal
its
not
really
bad
but
its
certainly
not
good
not
bad
could
be
more
robust
and
full
but
the
textures
good
and
the
taste
is
too
would
drink
this
again
this
is
another
one
of
those
original
microbrews
perhaps
going
back
further
than
stone
but
not
as
far
back
as
sierra
nevada
or
sam
adams
a
very
good
amber
ale
with
a
good
carbonation
quality
that
give
fizzy
beer
drinkers
something
to
enjoy
with
enough
maltiness
for
the
rest
of
us
one
of
my
more
wellliked
styles
of
beer
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
brewery
though
found
a
lot
of
their
other
stuff
pretty
mediocre
but
unbiased
for
this
one
pours
a
light
amber
color
almost
golden
color
small
head
to
it
not
much
for
lacing
faint
caramel
malt
aroma
to
it
first
impression
on
taste
very
light
bodied
even
for
this
style
just
not
a
lot
of
meat
to
it
kinda
feels
like
too
watered
down
and
affects
the
taste
profile
of
the
beer
as
in
the
beer
is
gone
before
you
can
taste
it
nothing
offensive
taste
wise
a
tad
bit
of
hops
and
more
of
the
caramel
malt
but
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
just
too
weakthin
to
make
this
a
great
red
ale
drinkable
but
id
have
a
lagunitas
imperial
red
or
ithaca
cascazilla
among
many
other
red
ales
drinkable
and
affordable
i
got
this
brew
for
49
awhile
back
this
is
the
last
of
the
cheapos
and
im
glad
because
i
think
it
may
have
been
losing
its
luster
notes
the
most
flavorful
beer
ive
ever
not
really
like
it
was
just
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
but
checked
all
the
boxes
this
is
my
4th
mendocino
beer
and
they
are
all
enjoyable
but
not
meant
for
the
faint
at
hear
they
brew
beers
that
you
truly
need
to
careful
with
and
respect
drinkability
could
easily
kill
another
32oz
pitcher
of
this
much
better
than
i
remembered
a
boldflavored
amber
that
is
mighty
tasty
beer
is
low
in
carbonation
and
is
nicely
balanced
a
couple
of
these
is
a
nice
treat
to
a
weekend
watching
the
baseball
game
overall
impression
the
metallic
taste
puts
a
bit
of
a
damper
on
the
fun
fairly
average
mouthfeel
touch
of
hops
touch
of
sweetness
hard
to
describe
but
easy
to
drink
decent
beer
that
tastes
good
but
is
so
subtle
in
taste
that
i
dont
know
what
to
think
d
for
me
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
it
goes
down
easily
enough
a
little
more
complexity
would
be
nice
cheers
drinkability
an
unremarkable
presentation
but
was
surprised
by
the
great
taste
i
liked
it
d
balanced
and
substantial
true
that
poured
into
a
pint
glass
head
quickly
disappeared
leaving
just
the
body
before
i
even
had
a
chance
to
drink
it
the
body
is
an
amber
color
go
figure
and
it
tastes
milder
than
other
red
ales
i
have
had
it
doesnt
have
that
bite
to
it
i
could
probably
drink
two
or
three
of
these
and
still
enjoy
it
i
can
smell
a
bit
of
the
roasted
barley
and
leaves
me
with
a
taste
of
barley
wine
not
bad
pours
reddish
amber
into
pint
glass
with
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
typical
lacing
smells
sweet
with
malt
and
caramel
hints
taste
is
a
little
light
with
sweet
malt
and
grain
dominating
a
little
watery
but
nicely
carbonated
incredibly
drinkable
would
go
well
in
the
hot
sun
smell
of
sweet
toasted
malt
and
fruity
hops
taste
has
some
caramel
sweetness
combined
nicely
with
earthy
and
piney
hops
well
balanced
flavoers
i
would
call
this
medium
body
and
moderately
carbonated
the
finish
and
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
a
bit
dry
well
made
easy
to
drink
sessional
pours
a
murky
amber
with
almost
no
head
even
with
a
hard
pour
what
head
there
is
settles
to
a
thin
swirl
smells
a
bit
tangy
with
yeast
and
malt
and
with
a
very
light
citrusy
hop
profile
the
taste
is
light
with
a
good
deal
of
sweet
malt
and
clean
citrus
a
tiny
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
but
fairly
refreshing
if
simple
d
i
could
guzzle
this
on
a
hot
day
another
classic
case
of
the
whole
beer
being
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
while
not
much
to
look
at
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
it
always
leaves
you
wanting
that
next
sip
or
gulp
a
solid
gettogether
beer
d
flavorful
amber
ale
for
sure
that
may
be
a
bit
hoopier
than
most
medoncino
produces
average
beers
at
best
in
my
experience
i
may
avoid
this
brewery
from
now
on
d
it
was
pretty
good
im
jonesing
for
another
but
i
would
drink
more
pours
an
orangish
colored
body
with
a
small
white
colored
head
pretty
quickly
diminishing
has
a
malty
fruity
aroma
fizzy
and
effervescent
very
enticing
has
a
fizzy
malty
nutty
taste
a
litte
bitternesssourness
nice
soft
mouthfeel
poured
clear
light
amber
with
one
finger
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
there
was
a
little
lacing
in
the
beginning
as
a
result
of
the
small
head
there
wasnt
a
powerful
aroma
but
it
did
smell
a
bit
sweet
mouthfeel
was
good
and
very
drinkable
however
it
was
slightly
bitter
something
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
have
considering
the
malts
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
about
this
ale
but
it
was
tasty
overall
its
just
decent
dont
love
it
by
any
means
and
wont
be
getting
again
i
cant
get
past
that
sharp
bitter
flavor
overall
i
liked
it
didnt
love
it
but
its
a
good
release
from
mendocino
fairly
light
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
overall
pretty
well
balanced
not
something
i
would
indulge
on
but
this
is
worth
looking
up
again
from
time
to
time
drinkability
a
decent
amber
ale
thats
very
middleoftheroad
in
terms
of
flavor
its
neither
overly
malty
or
hoppy

drinkability
i
understand
why
this
turned
me
onto
craft
beer
this
is
such
a
good
introduction
to
any
craft
brewery
just
because
it
combines
the
best
of
both
worlds
hops
and
malt
which
is
lacking
thereof
in
most
of
these
bmc
brewers
this
is
very
sessionable
at
6
abv
and
it
hasnt
changed
a
wink
since
ive
had
it
6
years
ago
but
why
should
it
this
will
go
down
as
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
brews
for
the
pure
fact
that
its
easy
to
swig
yet
flavorful
enough
to
enjoy
and
not
get
bored
of
it
a
must
have
beer
that
should
be
picked
up
as
soon
as
you
see
it
red
tail
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
on
the
malty
side
but
hops
are
definitely
present
caramel
malt
is
obvious
in
the
flavor
hops
are
also
present
but
arent
as
prominent
not
particularly
well
balanced
but
its
a
decent
beer
overall
im
not
really
impressed
by
this
beer
i
love
amber
ales
but
this
seems
like
a
rather
poor
effort
its
an
ok
beer
but
it
is
lacking
in
hops
and
has
too
much
of
a
yeast
like
taste
to
it
a
pleasant
amber
ale
bready
biscuit
with
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
one
of
my
favorite
session
ales
d
a
pretty
good
offering
from
medocino
here
i
can
see
why
its
a
classic
good
change
of
pace
balanced
brew
in
a
hopdominated
genre
nice
brew
with
very
little
head
retention
but
it
was
served
on
tap
the
color
was
nice
deep
and
a
rich
red
smelled
great
not
really
full
bodied
i
didnt
care
for
the
mouthfeel
because
of
the
dry
chaulky
aftertaste
average
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
have
another
i
dont
normally
like
fruitytasting
beer
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
poured
bright
red
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
floral
aroma
with
strawberries
and
pale
malt
sweet
but
not
overpowering
good
balance
of
citrus
hops
caramel
malt
and
the
kiwistrawberry
flavor
very
smooth
nikki
opinion
the
backbone
of
the
beer
reminds
me
of
a
vienna
lager
with
american
hops
and
ale
yeast
i
would
guess
that
this
beer
is
only
around
30
ibus
which
makes
it
really
drinkable
for
the
abv
it
has
the
beer
is
clean
and
you
can
drink
them
a
lot
faster
than
a
lot
of
them
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
enough
to
me
that
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
i
could
drink
several
of
these
the
drinkability
was
nice
and
this
would
be
a
very
food
friendly
brew
as
well
thinbodied
with
very
little
carbonation
the
drink
is
mild
and
underpowered
but
inoffensive
just
another
unremarkable
brew
from
a
mostly
unremarkable
brewer
ho
hum
drinkability
is
pretty
average
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
brews
out
there
either
the
taste
is
similar
malty
with
a
leafyherbalcitrusy
bitterness
and
finish
with
toasted
crackers
caramel
and
general
hops
it
is
somewhat
subdued
arguably
a
hair
on
the
bland
side
and
its
not
especially
exciting
however
its
still
flavourful
with
the
flavours
holding
up
well
its
very
wellbalanced
solid
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
though
remaining
interesting
it
has
a
faintly
full
warming
quality
from
the
alcohol
but
this
is
light
d
the
crisp
taste
and
overall
mildness
makes
this
very
drinkable
but
not
as
much
as
others
made
by
this
brewery
amber
ales
are
just
a
bit
too
malty
for
me
its
really
not
a
bad
looking
beer
but
im
a
bit
surprised
at
how
mediocre
it
is
otherwise
particularly
the
nose
is
metallic
drowning
out
all
but
the
smallest
whisper
of
hops
the
beer
could
be
a
deeper
red
but
i
thought
that
it
formed
a
nice
head
the
taste
wasnt
bad
but
pretty
boring
there
is
some
malt
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
none
of
it
is
strong
or
interesting
enough
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
watery
with
too
little
carbonation
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
despite
the
beers
faults
its
fairly
drinkable
the
numbing
metallic
taste
is
starting
to
make
an
argument
for
me
to
further
lower
the
score
so
ill
end
it
there
i
would
accept
one
for
free
on
the
chance
that
ive
got
a
bad
batch
subtract
the
metallic
flavor
and
my
scores
would
go
up
some
d
average
drinkability
ok
at
first
but
wouldnt
be
to
enthused
about
drinking
this
in
multiples
i
recall
liking
my
first
red
tail
a
few
months
backthen
not
being
too
impressed
by
the
second
hopefully
this
one
is
a
reliable
impression
so
i
at
least
know
what
i
think
of
it
pours
a
nice
semi
cloudy
deep
amber
color
with
large
frothy
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
light
hay
and
dough
the
flavor
has
wonderful
balance
between
the
sweet
malt
and
citrus
hops
which
is
true
to
he
style
medium
body
thick
and
chewy
texture
finishes
medium
and
again
leaning
toward
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
clean
not
a
lot
of
body
or
flavor
especially
for
6
abv
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
its
not
enticing
mediocre
i
had
two
in
a
row
and
thats
about
it
a
pleasant
brew
for
sure
glad
i
found
it
well
carbonated
and
substantial
with
a
nice
finish
a
perfect
session
ale
overall
i
was
disappointed
w
red
tail
ale
its
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
and
i
may
have
been
a
bit
harsh
i
used
to
love
the
stuff
but
i
think
the
recipe
should
be
tweaked
fat
chance
theyll
do
that
given
its
place
as
their
flagship
ale
however
i
remember
having
it
last
fall
at
about
7
months
old
and
i
loved
itseemed
like
the
fermentable
sugars
from
the
caramel
malt
that
added
to
my
dislike
of
the
taste
feel
drink
were
acted
uponconverted
ill
have
to
give
it
another
shot
to
be
sure
about
my
opinion
drinkability
average
drinkability
a
better
than
average
red
ale
but
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
i
could
have
a
couple
very
easily
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
hop
flavor
to
balance
out
the
malt
flavor
pours
a
clear
sunsent
gold
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
soapy
head
that
quickly
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
some
thin
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
corn
hay
and
grains
some
caramel
sweetness
and
honey
as
well
not
the
most
enjoyable
aroma
taste
begins
with
white
bread
sugar
and
toasted
grains
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
piney
hops
midway
aftertaste
consists
of
straw
corn
and
butter
give
me
more
hops
just
not
a
very
pleasant
tasting
beer
light
to
medium
body
with
a
slick
and
syrupy
feel
carbonation
is
pretty
low
and
takes
away
from
the
experience
i
just
couldnt
get
into
this
beer
at
all
ill
pass
being
that
my
dad
is
a
falconer
we
have
this
beer
around
all
the
time
it
seems
like
i
have
had
this
several
times
and
finally
decided
to
review
it
not
great
in
my
opinion
but
he
buys
it
for
other
reasons
than
that
obviously
saw
this
in
hawaii
surprisingly
too
will
drink
again
not
by
choice
might
be
worth
trying
clear
orange
with
a
bronzish
tint
and
a
decent
cap
of
somewhat
creamy
dirty
cream
some
sweet
fruit
and
caramel
with
mostly
a
toasted
grainy
base
and
some
earthy
bitterness
decently
feeling
medium
body
with
a
modestly
creamy
carb
like
their
lager
i
found
this
offering
to
be
one
with
some
favorable
attributes
but
mostly
unimpressive
sampled
out
of
the
bottle
and
also
in
a
glass
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
dirty
copper
tint
there
is
minimal
head
and
moderate
lacing
average
amount
of
aroma
that
is
nice
with
characteristics
of
sweet
malt
fruity
overtones
and
a
faint
hint
of
hops
adequate
mouthfeel
for
an
ale
somewhat
filling
rather
smooth
with
an
easy
finish
the
flavor
is
considerably
better
than
average
the
malt
characteristics
are
easily
tasted
and
there
are
some
sweet
flavors
that
also
stand
out
caramel
perhaps
a
nice
hearty
hop
finish
rounds
out
an
overall
pleasant
and
enjoyable
ale
this
one
is
decent
d
pretty
boring
and
bland
why
is
this
over
8
a
sixer
its
easy
drinking
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
easy
drinking
beers
with
more
flavor
than
this
ive
had
a
few
of
these
over
the
last
few
weeks
before
deciding
to
review
the
beer
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
pub
glass
in
makes
a
moderate
size
head
which
recedes
to
a
thin
white
rim
of
head
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
i
like
the
clear
copper
appearance
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
nice
with
both
malt
and
hops
making
their
appearance
when
i
first
had
this
beer
some
weeks
ago
i
wasnt
that
impressed
but
the
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
slowly
worked
my
way
through
the
six
pack
i
bought
for
7
at
the
local
trader
joes
i
has
a
more
pronounced
malt
character
than
say
sierra
nevada
also
it
has
a
pine
character
to
the
hops
while
other
pale
ales
sierra
nevada
etc
have
a
stronger
citrus
based
bitterness
im
assuming
mendocino
is
using
a
different
varietys
of
hop
than
simply
cascade
the
finish
lingers
pleasantly
bitter
good
beer
ill
probable
buy
some
more
sometime
d
good
example
of
a
american
red
ale
but
nothing
special
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
the
off
notes
of
this
beer
makes
it
difficult
to
deal
with
overall
very
limited
pours
a
nice
normal
off
red
color
with
great
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
but
very
weak
almost
nothing
there
it
was
hard
to
pick
out
anything
good
taste
but
not
great
a
nice
malty
red
ale
with
a
nice
balanced
aftertaste
but
not
much
else
it
does
go
down
very
smooth
not
bad
in
the
mixed
pack
but
i
wont
buy
it
by
itself
d
great
easy
drinking
red
ale
could
be
a
strong
contender
for
my
favorite
warm
weather
refresher
this
one
will
definitely
make
its
way
into
my
summer
plans
a
rather
pricey
beer
and
not
too
spectacular
either
its
decent
but
ive
had
plenty
of
amber
ales
that
are
much
better
and
affordable
clear
orange
brown
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
evaporates
into
a
small
smear
more
malty
than
hoppy
a
bit
like
a
brown
ale
and
yet
fruity
easy
drinking
slightly
effervescent
body
is
medium
to
full
slightly
crunchy
but
pleasant
despite
the
malty
aroma
the
flavor
is
hoppy
to
the
tongue
with
a
balanced
malt
finisha
surprise
in
its
roundness
not
overwhelming
but
as
a
sixpacker
this
could
be
quite
enjoyableprobably
solid
with
grill
fair
or
snacks
notes
not
the
worst
i
have
had
by
a
long
runbut
too
dry
bitter
for
my
taste
does
not
seem
well
balanced
i
do
not
think
i
will
buy
this
againyet
it
seemed
worth
trying
the
flavors
of
the
brew
are
not
bad
just
dry
took
from
moan
and
doves
grand
menu
of
bottles
poured
with
a
dark
red
appearance
no
head
or
lacing
though
its
sugarish
malts
were
a
little
too
artificial
smelling
to
my
palate
however
its
taste
faired
better
with
its
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
the
drink
was
a
bit
thin
but
still
maintained
a
medium
body
overall
nothing
spectacular
md
crisp
and
smooth
very
drinkable
ale
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
copperorange
color
with
a
thin
stable
head
smell
is
of
caramel
and
nutty
malts
and
a
touch
fruity
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
prominantly
malty
only
enough
hops
to
balance
a
lingering
malt
aftertaste
there
seems
to
be
a
staleness
about
the
bottle
which
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
freshness
date
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
chewy
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
color
the
head
is
a
half
an
inch
in
height
an
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
watery
texture
and
a
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
but
its
other
aspects
detract
too
much
for
it
to
be
fully
enjoyable
i
suppose
i
could
drink
this
again
but
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
taste
is
slight
hops
a
bland
taste
with
nothing
to
really
write
about
what
is
it
a
mix
of
things
gone
wrong
i
did
not
even
swallow
avoid
despite
killians
being
one
of
the
first
beers
i
could
enjoy
im
not
that
big
a
fan
of
red
ales
theyre
a
lot
like
regular
ales
but
instead
of
having
more
hops
or
malt
they
have
a
more
bland
flavor
added
in
that
makes
them
red
regardless
i
still
dont
mind
having
one
here
and
there
this
one
in
particular
was
smooth
mild
and
clean
mendocino
makes
good
beers
no
matter
that
the
style
and
this
was
no
different
i
would
not
call
this
a
session
beer
as
the
dryness
requires
sipping
and
savoring
to
enjoy
several
of
these
could
be
a
lot
of
work
but
the
one
i
am
drinking
is
very
enjoyable
d
again
the
finest
example
of
an
amber
ale
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
drinking
its
surprising
others
have
not
liked
it
more
ambers
are
not
the
best
style
in
the
world
but
this
is
the
one
to
drink
if
you
want
to
try
one
d
its
drinkable
i
wish
its
taste
was
a
bit
better
i
found
it
to
not
fit
what
i
enjoy
but
others
might
like
it
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
as
an
amber
ale
the
hop
characteristics
balance
well
and
at
6
it
is
definitely
something
i
could
sit
and
enjoy
a
few
of
nice
appearance
and
delightful
smell
but
was
not
happy
with
the
taste
the
taste
was
shocking
in
a
bad
way
to
say
the
least
i
drank
this
beer
on
multiple
occasions
and
was
always
left
with
a
very
bitter
not
very
appealing
aftertaste
personally
it
was
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
due
to
aftertaste
however
friends
seemed
to
disagree
and
enjoyed
the
taste
but
eventually
agreed
on
the
strange
aftertaste
poured
a
light
redorange
with
a
one
finger
head
that
left
a
thick
ring
almost
right
away
with
some
decent
lacing
there
was
some
great
carbonation
with
bubbles
flying
upward
smelled
of
straw
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
a
little
hop
presence
tasted
a
little
dry
with
some
spiciness
there
were
some
caramel
notes
and
a
good
dry
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
and
is
whats
expected
for
the
style
the
drinkability
was
good
for
the
style
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
too
impressive
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
first
off
the
beer
finishes
semidry
moderately
low
carbonation
levels
seem
to
work
for
this
beer
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
something
thats
almost
medium
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
real
easy
however
this
isnt
one
that
id
be
looking
for
in
the
future
nothing
special
here

this

my
generalization
pours
with

and
the
lacing
is
pretty
good
actually
smell
is
just
plain
jane
stuff
as
is
the
taste
some
bitterness
but
it
seems
a
bit
jumbled
for
the

not
2
bad
but
falls
quite
short
of
a
repeat
cement
is
only
sand
that
sets
this
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
while
eating
a
meal
i
paired
up
this
beer
with
some
hickory
flavored
chicken
and
also
a
plate
of
fajitas
and
i
was
very
satisfied
definetly
buying
a
six
pack
soon
d
i
could
suck
these
down
but
they
are
fairly
plain
a
good
drinking
beer
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
lower
4

would
be
good
i
had
not
heard
of
this
before
i
had
it
at
my
girlfriends
decent
brew
pretty
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
was
faint
and
pretty
nondescript
waterythin
texture
nothing
special
went
well
with
dinner
this
is
a
good
standard
solid
amber
with
no
adjuncts
id
buy
again
ingredients
bottle
calls
out
pale
and
caramel
malted
barley
drinkability
is
very
good
nicly
balanced
crisp
and
on
the
sweeter
side
a
true
classic
for
the
style
pours
a
slightly
hazed
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
if
the
haze
werent
there
id
probably
go
up
5
more
on
the
appearance
very
mild
nose
very
slight
touches
of
hops
and
citrus
but
not
really
much
to
speak
of
and
this
was
off
a
somewhat
aggressive
pour
flavor
is
strong
with
a
metallic
edge
off
the
start
almost
makes
me
go
eck
once
you
get
past
that
there
are
sweet
tones
with
hop
influence
but
overall
way
too
much
metallic
edge
after
a
while
i
feel
like
i
left
a
penny
in
my
mouth
too
long
feel
is
actually
pretty
decent
it
might
be
the
highlight
of
the
whole
experience
strong
carbonation
and
a
thicker
feel
on
the
fluid
but
overall
it
doesnt
do
much
to
save
the
drinkability
not
really
worth
trying
or
in
my
case
trying
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
red
with
hints
of
gold
and
an
offwhite
head
that
lingers
to
midglass
and
leaves
little
lacing
aroma
is
muted
but
what
is
there
is
hoppy
and
fruity
mostly
apples
and
grapes
mouthfeel
is
farily
bland
but
the
flavor
picks
up
the
hoppy
fruit
theme
and
adds
a
touvh
of
malty
sweetness
all
leading
to
a
well
rounded
finish
i
never
pick
this
one
up
but
have
many
times
in
the
past
i
will
buy
again
but
more
when
i
want
an
apa
doesnt
strike
me
as
an
amber
more
as
a
apa
pretty
good
across
the
board
i
had
this
as
a
single
dont
think
i
would
recommend
or
try
again
it
wasnt
horrible
i
guess
i
expect
more
out
of
a
craft
beer
pretty
drinkable
a
little
too
bitter
for
the
style
but
its
forgivable
as
its
a
tasty
beer
on
its
own
there
are
some
other
kinds
id
rather
have
in
this
style
but
id
get
it
in
a
pinch
for
sure
worth
noting
the
5
99
sixer
is
real
easy
on
the
wallet
as
the
other
examples
i
mentioned
usually
run
about
8
99
or
so
this
is
an
average
brew
balanced
and
all
around
good
it
would
be
a
nice
brew
with
dinner
a
great
football
beer
and
a
perfectly
good
choice
to
order
on
a
date
you
know
when
you
want
to
impress
the
ladies
with
a
cunning
knowledge
of
american
brewmanship
feels
wet
and
creamy
thick
like
an
english
ale
smoothens
out
as
it
warms
up
overall
not
bad
bitter
but
with
a
flowery
sweet
base
a
very
mild
red
ale
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
but
honestly
i
probably
wouldnt
i
bought
this
beer
in
a
put
it
together
6pack
and
i
like
it
just
fine
but
will
not
seek
it
out
mouth
happiness
more
than
happy
to
except
a
lifetime
supply
final
thoughts

very
smooth
clean
and
refreshing
great
session
beer
solid
choice
for
those
wanting
a
norcal
beer
that
isnt
overly
hoppy
yet
dark
flavorful
enough
for
those
with
a
discerning
beer
palate
d
pretty
good
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
the
single
bottle
overall
a
pretty
impressive
brew
and
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
tried
recommended
strong
mouthfeel
owes
much
to
crisp
but
not
overdone
carbonation
the
american
amber
has
come
to
be
a
style
that
i
have
little
to
no
interest
in
but
this
is
an
above
average
entrant
in
said
category
if
you
need
an
amber
fix
this
seems
like
it
would
do
the
trick
a
decent
however
somewhat
forgettable
red
ale
i
may
be
biased
because
i
am
a
bigger
fan
of
amber
ales
but
i
had
a
bit
higher
hopes
for
this
one
a
solid
brew
and
well
worth
the
try
but
this
will
not
be
high
on
the
list
in
the
future
color
poured
a
redorangeish
color
decent
drinkability
but
could
not
see
myself
making
a
session
out
of
this
one
trader
joes
may
be
a
good
spot
to
pick
this
up
defnitley
cheaper
than
i
have
seen
other
places
would
drink
again
however
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
ahold
of
this
one
d
tastes
good
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
while
watching
football
on
a
sunday
afternoon
drinkability
quality
drink
i
would
get
this
again
taste
is
pure
malt
some
roasted
barley
a
nice
sweet
undertone
that
isnt
overwhelming
goes
great
with
pizza
and
cal
victories
over
oregon
will
look
for
in
the
future
it
is
crisp
and
pretty
clean
smooth
a
decent
choice
for
an
easy
session
ale
the
red
tail
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
little
carbonation
and
a
head
that
disappears
rapidly
it
smells
malty
and
the
taste
is
mostly
a
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
hopiness
to
even
it
out
the
mouthfeel
for
me
was
mostly
on
the
tongue
and
overall
a
decent
brew
overall
not
a
strong
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
weak
in
general
the
smell
is
lacking
and
the
taste
is
decent
at
best
the
beer
has
an
amberorangish
color
to
it
with
little
head
and
poor
retention
the
smell
is
clean
with
caramel
and
dextrin
it
has
a
decent
taste
to
it
your
typical
sweet
malt
and
raw
hop
flavor
but
i
wasnt
really
impressed
by
this
offering
notes
im
a
very
happy
man
since
mendocino
started
brewing
in
saratoga
springs
ny
great
news
for
the
east
coast
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
and
some
lacing
aromas
of
slightly
caramel
malt
with
some
herbel
spice
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
bready
dry
well
hopped
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
no
after
taste
very
nice
beer
another
good
session
beer
i
will
buy
it
again
not
a
bad
beer
and
not
a
terrible
representation
of
the
style
either
poured
up
about
the
same
colour
as
watered
down
tea
a
bit
of
an
orangered
colour
with
a
nice
soapy
egg
shell
coloured
head
smell
was
mostly
sweet
malt
but
had
some
detectable
hop
hiding
in
the
backgroud
as
well
nice
taste
was
sweet
malts
up
front
bitter
hops
in
the
middle
and
then
dry
roasted
cereal
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
thick
i
felt
not
quite
what
id
call
syrupy
but
certainly
too
heavy
for
the
style
not
bad
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
it
d
quite
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
content
because
of
its
smoothness
easy
to
drink
a
decent
amber
with
a
bit
more
hops
and
substance
than
most
red
tail
ale
is
a
good
ale
and
most
will
agree
that
it
is
crisp
and
offers
some
decent
hop
character
but
it
didnt
quite
meet
my
high
expectations
and
thus
i
consider
this
only
an
average
ale
overall
drinks
okay
this
is
shadow
of
what
it
was
10
years
ago
wheres
the
malt
hop
guts
would
do
in
a
pinch
d
really
very
average
middle
of
the
road
although
that
may
be
the
style
id
call
this
a
solid
session
brew
save
for
the
fact
that
it
goes
above
the
5
cutoff
point
speaking
of
this
is
not
a
beer
id
expect
to
be
6
could
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
a
slightly
above
average
red
ale
with
some
sort
of
character
back
in
the
day
under
the
original
owners
in
california
this
was
considered
to
be
a
real
flagship
beer
not
just
for
the
brewery
but
for
craft
beer
in
general
sadly
that
is
far
from
the
case
now
cant
be
sure
if
the
beer
is
dumbed
down
or
our
expectations
and
tastes
are
raised
but
drinking
this
calls
up
the
phrase
what
happened
disappointing
and
not
something
id
pick
up
outside
of
a
variety
pack
anymore
the
flavor
begins
with
a
dark
malts
but
the
hops
soon
overwhelms
it
and
im
rapidly
trying
to
decide
how
this
is
different
from
a
big
pale
ale
oh
yeah
the
color
it
finishes
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
biscuity
texture
color
is
clear
amberyellow
decent
head
aroma
is
decidedly
malty
with
strong
citrus
hints
and
a
whisper
of
hops
flavor
has
nice
balance
of
maltiness
and
hoppiness
fairly
but
not
unpleasantly
bitter
just
a
touch
of
orange
a
refreshing
and
jazzy
ale
a
good
party
brew
or
companion
to
a
meal
enjoyable
brew
id
definitely
do
you
again
interesting
stuff
when
you
think
about
it
but
its
not
something
i
can
drink
copious
amounts
of
before
wanting
to
move
along
not
a
bad
amber
ale
nothing
mindblowing
either
give
it
a
shot
if
you
havent
this
is
the
second
brew
i
have
tried
from
mendocino
and
they
taste
very
promising
i
will
definitely
try
more
of
their
brews
this
beer
has
a
nice
roasty
malty
smell
to
it
the
bottle
i
got
came
from
ny
so
im
guessing
medocino
has
two
breweries
it
appears
to
be
a
nice
amber
colored
beer
with
white
lacing
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
lasting
bittering
hoppy
aftertaste
i
dont
taste
the
flavor
hops
as
much
but
the
malt
bill
apparently
takes
care
of
that
since
it
tastes
complex
nice
overall
american
ale

good
drinking

got
it
on
a

with
no

and
no

this
was
an
excellent
choice
buy
six
of
these
and
six
redhooks
and
compare
had
never
tried
the
red
tail
before
and
as
i
perused
the
usual
offerings
at
the
local
retailer
it
just
sort
of
caught
my
eye
from
mendocino
o
k
they
should
know
something
about
brew
found
the
ale
quite
interesting
the
biscuit
and
hop
thing
jumped
out
at
me
first
plenty
of
fruitiness
as
well
nice
head
beautiful
body
color
smooth
very
drinkable
i
grabbed
these
after
a
session
on
the
skeet
field
and
they
were
just
the
ticket
i
would
drink
this
brew
again
deeelicious
pours
a
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
fizzy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
mostly
toasted
and
biscuity
malt
with
some
caramel
and
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
delicious
malt
backbone
with
a
nice
hop
finish
this
brew
is
balanced
nicely
and
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
this
beer
had
a
fairly
malty
taste
but
a
fairly
distinguishable
bitterness
lurking
in
the
background
from
the
hops
and
also
a
little
bit
of
a
leafy
hop
flavor
as
well
a
good
mouthfeel
and
easy
taste
makes
this
pretty
drinkable
though
d
all
in
all
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
not
sure
of
the
abv
website
doesnt
list
it
either
but
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
easy
drinking
ale
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
really
enjoyable
worth
a
try
i
am
a
little
confused
by
the
unfavorable
reviews
because
i
found
this
a
very
tasty
and
clear
beer
its
a
simple
taste
and
i
could
kick
back
a
couple
with
no
problem
a
sure
recommend
for
anyone
looking
for
a
refreshing
beer

could
have
a

these
seems
to
go
right
to
my
head
though
verdict
not
a

beer
but
not
much
of
note
though
either
seemed
pretty
standard
average
for
the
style
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
more
but
would
sure
drink
one
bought
for
me
poured

aroma
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
nicely
balanced
with
hoppyness
and
a
mouthpuckering
sourness
that
i
personaly
find
very
appealing
although
others
might
not
feel
the
same
a
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
ale
d
certainly
an
all
beer
occasion
beer
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
a
muted
hops
with
definate
hints
of
grain
and
even
a
slight
caramel
taste
was
a
bit
thin
but
had
a
definate
sugary
touch
to
it
hoppy
dry
finish
with
a
tiny
pine
bite
very
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
i
could
see
this
being
served
in
large
numbers
as
it
is
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
d
this
is
a
very
good
amber
beer
it
has
a
delicous
sweet
taste
overall
i
found
it
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
bottles
to
enjoy
ill
definitely
keep
my
eye
out
for
it
in
my
area
will
i
revisit
this
brewy
i
got
this
12
ounze
bottle
from
a
mendocino
mixed
case
at
kunda
bev
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
solid
amount
of
head
that
was
nice
and
fluffy
with
smallish
bubbles
there
again
was
a
bunch
of
sticky
lace
the
color
was
a
beautiful
dark
amber
the
smell
left
much
to
be
desired
there
wasnt
much
of
one
at
all
what
my
nose
did
pick
up
was
pleasent
though
the
taste
was
wonderful
it
was
blended
wonderfully
there
were
excelent
hop
undertones
the
taste
was
unbleaviably
smooth
an
awsome
brew
dont
drink
and
review
pours
honey
color
thin
white
head
with
decent
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a

feel
taste
is
of
honey
and
butterscotch
up
front
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
d
i
am
impressed
with
this
one
it
is
drinkable
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
might
have
it
again
some
time
after
this
beer
i
bought
a
special
caramel
brew
just
for
comparison
and
could
barely
notice
a
difference
a
good
beer
all
and
all
though
i
am
tasting
a
very
pale
red
ale
here
not
the
best
by
far
d
i
could
definitely
put
this
one
into
my
rotation
of
nfl
gameday
beers
it
has
some
really
good
flavors
in
it
its
not
too
filling
or
too
light
and
its
strong
enough
for
me
to
notice
but
not
so
strong
that
i
couldnt
drink
three
or
four
in
a
sitting
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
extremely
good
i
could
quaff
a
few
of
these
no
problem
tastes
so
good
how
will
you
know
when
to
stop
drinkability
i
dont
have
to
say
any
more
about
why
this
is
tough
to
drink
medium
body
and
perfect
carbonation
make
this
tasty
ale
an
all
too
easy
too
drink
apa
moderate
abv
label
states
6
1
and
it
is
noticable
but
not
over
powering
another
one
of
mendocinos
tasty
ales
cheers
drinkability
the
hops
impede
the
drinkability
a
little
but
its
still
a
refreshing
beer
very
thin
and
watery
not
much
substance
at
all
in
the
taste
or
on
the
palate
wouldnt
recommend
anyone
tries
this
you
wont
be
missing
much
of
anything
at
all
overall
a
nice
average
beer
nothing
to
go
hunting
for
in
aroma
or
flavor
nothing
to
make
it
stick
out
in
its
style
however
it
is
a
good
everyday
ale
from
the
style
i
would
enjoy
this
as
a
nice
alternative
when
drinking
with
friends
at
a
cookout
d
good
as
well
this
is
a
session
beer
easy
drinking
and
not
overly
complex
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
because
i
hadnt
seen
it
before
andi
admit
itit
was
the
cheapest
on
the
wall
of
craft
beer
you
get
what
you
pay
for
it
was
badly
conceived
and
executed
the
malt
character
was
just
funky
it
didnt
have
the
crisp
drinkable
character
of
a
typical
amber
which
is
what
i
was
looking
for
since
i
bought
it
for
drinking
at
my
shorehouse
now
there
are
five
bottles
left
want
one
this
is
a
good
brew
yet
no
one
thing
really
stands
out
its
redeeming
quality
is
its
balance
and
overall
its
crisp
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
this
beer
was
not
quite
what
i
expected
much
more
tart
but
i
didnt
necessarily
find
it
a
bad
thing
just
unexpected
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
and
watch
a
movie
with
or
to
have
on
a
nite
with
company
and
cards
d
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
i
might
buy
it
again
but
not
anytime
soon

the

also
rather
good
with
just
that
right

a
decent

this
is
one

the
most

i
have
ever
had
and
i
will
buy
some
more

nice
disappointed
by
this
beer
that
really
seems
to
be
trying
to
do
too
much
not
a
big
fan
of
red
ales
but
this
one
is
worth
drinking
any
day
very
tasty
i
think
it
is
really
vibrant
toward
the
beginning
with
a
nice
hoppy
blast
but
then
gets
quite
drying
and
heavy
with
some
malty
and
drying
earthy
bitterness
notes
all
around
a
very
tasty
beer
but
not
up
to
maines
other
amazing
beers
poured
the
yeast
accidentally
and
made
it
chalky
i
think
that
ruined
the
hop
flavor
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
from
a
red
ale
from

this
is
followed
by
a
blend
of

and
burnt
sugar
before
a
long
and
brilliantly
bitter
finish
dominated
by
the
most
gorgeously
oily
and
resiny
feel
this
is
by
no
means
the
oiliest
beer
there
ever
was
nor
does
it
come
close
but
instead
exudes
great
depth
this
is
further
enhanced
by
a
soft
and
supple
carbonation
fantastic
stuff
maine

has
always
impressed

this

o
overall
very
good

hops
outshine
the

the

made
more

an
appearance

a

full
flavored
and
tasty
brew
for
those
who
dare
enjoy
with
caution
this
one
has
a
big
hoppiness
to
it
probably
not
a
good
idea
to
pare
it
up
with
a
meal
unless
you
happen
to
be
eating
something
quite
robust
but
its
absolutely
delicious
it
didnt
really
seem
like
either
a
red
ipa
or
hoppy
amber
ale
it
tasted
like
a
great
ipa
with
a
slightly
dark
color
wheelbarrow
sits
just
off
center
of
their
best
brews
o
maine
does
simple
beer
wonderfully
and
this
fits
that
trend
glad
i
was
able
to
taste
it
fresh
because
that
seems
to
be
key
with
their
beers
this
is
a
very
good
hoppy
amber
that
easily
could
be
called
a
red
ipa
regardless
of
what
mbc
claims
its
very
hoppy
but
its
got
a
dry
grainy
malt
bill
that
comes
through
very
strong
and
clean
another
fine
maine
beer
company
beer
enjoy
o
interesting

another
changeup
and
enjoyed
overall
really
enjoyed
this
red
ale
would
certainly
try
it
again
if
i
could
get
a
fresher
bottle
i
often
overlook
this
style
but
this
brew
makes
me
want
to
explore
a
bit
more

higher

ambers
light
feel

abv
beer
not
really
surprising
since
its
rather
dry
i
dont
love
the
style
but
this
is
an
excellent
example
and
a
very
well
made
beer
its
dry
and
bitter
with
good
flavor
easy
to
drink
seems
like
it
would
go
great
with
pizza
overall
a
fine
red
ale
i
like
hoppier
red
ales
and
this
is
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
o
debated
long
and
hard
between
4
and
4
25
but
i
always
go
with
taste
in
the
end
and
this
beer
is
complex
and
balanced
and
i
would
visit
it
again
anytime
overall
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
and
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
i
think
it
travels
better
than
some
other
mbc
offerings
i
can
find
in
my
area
mean
old
tom
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
gives
it
a
run
for
the
money
excellent
brew
o
mbc
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
really
enjoyable
to
drink
o
my
least
favorite
maine
beer
so
far
but
not
bad
by
any
means
just
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
hops
would
have
liked
to
seen
them
dialed
down
a
bit
and
the
malt
come
through
a
bit
more
i
would
buy
a
lot
more
of
their
beer
if
it
was
offered
in
12
oz
4packs
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
would
be
welcomed
at
a
lower
pricepoint
as
it
would
be
great
to
always
have
on
hand
somewhat
reminiscent
as
arrogant
bastard
but
more
balanced
than
an
all
on
hop
assault
like
the
aroma
the
roasted
barley
malts
kick
in
on
the
first
sip
but
the
hops
quickly
scuttle
that
and
take
things
over
bringing
out
this
piney
floral
bitter
finish
quite
a
hopped
up
version
of
amber
red
smooth
but
drier
feel
with
a
dark
roast
bitterness
o
i
really
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
from
maine
beer
company
ive
always
been
impressed
with
their
output
and
this
is
no
exception
it
does
however
come
with
a
hefty
price
tag
this
beer
is
not
cheap
at
least
in
massachusetts
not
a
huge
fan
of
that
but
for
that
once
in
a
awhile
splurge
be
sure
to
try
this
big
tan
head
atop
a
ruby
hued
beer
with
tons
of
lacing
left
behind
floral
spicy
and
earthy
hop
presence
with
a
crusty
toasted
bread
like
backdrop
taste
follows
with
the
floral
hops
and
perfectly
balanced
by
that
toasted
malty
backdrop
taste
is
good
but
somewhat
linear
and
one
dimensional
medium
mouthfeel
and
bigger
carbonation
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
good
red
ale
but
i
dont
prefer
it
to
the
likes
of
nugget
nectar
overall
another
great
beer
from
maine
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
was
totally
stoked
when
a
work
friend
texted
me
that
he
could
pick
one
up
they
just
dont
know
how
to
disappoint
at
maine
beer
if
you
are
able
to
get
one
of
these
do
yourself
a
favor
and
do
it
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
hoppy
red
ale
to
drink
for
a
long
time
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
this
excellent
brewery
time
for
them
to
go
to
four
packs
so
the
brice
can
improve
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
mbo
my
only
gripe
would
be
that
the
smell
seemed
the
same
from
each
of
their
other
beers
but
who
knows
a
fantastic
beer
nonetheless
o
good
stuff
if
this
were
priced
like
nn
id
be
happy
to
buy
it
regularly
when
nn
was
offseason
as
its
a
nice
substitute
o
a
very
enjoyable
well
done
beer
quite
focused
and
certainly
drinkable
o
the
body
is
just
too
weak
for
me
the
flavors
are
all
really
nice
but
i
cant
sink
my
teeth
into
the
beer
with
the
high
carbonation
and
thin
body
it
drinks
more
like
a
soda
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
and
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
a
beer
id
be
picking
up
again
that
said
i
am
a
big
fan
of
maine
beer
company
who
make
a
lot
of
fantastic
beers
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
red
ale
more
than
one
can
be
enjoyed
in
a
session
o
waited
a
bit
long
to
crack
open
this
bottle
but
still
holds
up
well
quite
enjoyable
gives
a
sessionable
impression
and
is
an
easy
drinker
m
medoum
boded
and
well
carbonated
thanks
cp45
for
the
opportunity
overall
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
mbc
makes
a
point
to
say
that
this
beer
is
not
a
red
ipa
although
i
prefer
a
greater
hop
presence
in
a
red
ale
this
beer
is
perfect
for
what
it
is
intended
to
be
for
that
reason
taste
gets
a
five
bravo
mbc
for
achieving
such
a
scrumptious
beer
that
showcases
the
hop
and
malt
profile
in
such
a
fresh
and
crisp
manner
this
is
my
first
time
trying
anything
from
maine
beer
company
and
i
look
very
forward
to
trying
others
if
this
beer
is
any
reflection
of
the
quality
coming
from
this
brewery
this
one
my
peeps
is
a
keeper
overall
pretty
nice
good
hop
character
nice
malty
base
for
an
amber
cross
between
an
amber
and
nice
ipa
almost
enjoyable
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
intense
foam
head
noticeable
lacing
and
for
me
a
very
powerful
citrus
aroma
grapefruit
appears
to
be
the
dominate
one
here
tastes
superb
with
nice
biting
hops
on
the
palate
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
smooth
not
a
super
fan
of
the
red
ale
style
but
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
again
maine
beer
co
has
come
through
with
a
really
decent
brew
glad
i
could
try
this
relatively
fresh
very
nice
and
highly
recommended
another
stellar
hop
forward
offering
from
maine
beer
but
im
noticing
a
trend
is
red
wheelbarrow
that
different
from
zoe
or
lunch
form
another
one
they
do
what
they
do
well
i
guess
i
seem
to
remember
zoe
being
a
bit
messy
so
maybe
i
just
contradicted
my
own
criticism
i
liked
it
well
enough
but
i
think
its
a
touch
too
hoppy
to
be
an
amber
o
not
worth
the
exorbitant
price
7
29
and
badly
outdone
by
zoe
in
my
opinion
this
might
spell
the
end
of
buying
maines
tres
cher
beers
good
beer
but
overall
not
recognizable
or
standoutish
i
understand
thats
what
some
people
want
but
there
is
just
nothing
terribly
unique
about
the
wheelbarrow
dont
take
this
as
i
dont
like
it
rather
its
hard
not
to
compare
to
another
one
lunch
dinner
and
even
though
they
are
different
styles
i
feel
this
one
feel
a
little
short
oenjoyable
amber
ale
flavorful
poured
a
amber
brown
body
with
two
finger
head
and
lace
patches
the
aroma
is
real
hoppy
with
notes
of
grass
and
maybe
pine
along
with
a
decent
chunk
of
caramel
and
a
little
bread
this
is
a
more
hoppy
red
and
one
of
the
hoppier
ones
that
gets
it
right
hops
are
the
star
as
the
beer
is
balanced
and
has
both
a
breadcracker
like
crispness
in
the
finish
and
caramel
sweetness
but
these
are
underneath
a
real
citric
and
fresh
hop
bite
that
is
very
pleasing
notes
bottled

and
drank
after
the

just
a
darn
good
beer
well

nothing

not

clear

persists

huge
citrus

aromas
are
nicely
countered
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
hints
of
dark

the
flavor
is
solidly
malty
with
caramel
and
toffee

with
hints
of

would
drink
so
much
of

i
werent
forced
to
buy
it

great
beer
pours
a

dense
head
of

three
fingers
very
even
surface
light

very
impressive
looking
slides
immediately
down
the
side
of
the
tilted
glass
only
a
rare
streak
of
lacing
to
be
found
the
overall
retention
is
excellent
filmy
amber
red
in
color
with
a
healthy
glow
you
have
to
get
really
close
to
see
the
active
bubbles
within
overall
the
color
may
be
closer
to
brown
than
orange

the
dark

mixes
cocoa

orange

baking

and
a
stiffening
amount
of
bright
hops
and
hard
crust
baguette
while
theres
little
that
is
bitter
it
never
feels
too
sweet
the
peach
apricot
red
cherry
pear
fruit
scents
are
much
more
complementary
than
the
star
of
the
show
mediumbodied
creamy
mouth

with
close

zero
softness

an
understated

not
a

and
bare
touch
of
black

spiced
oranges
chamomile

the
breadiness
is
not
sweet
but
is
a
steadying
cornerstone
peach
apricot
nectarine
fruit
with
a
touch
of
pineapple
it
has
a
slimmed
down
fluidity
which
you
dont
find
often
these
days
in
this
beer
category
goes
on
and
on
at
the
end
entirely
unforced
note
bottled
on
111213
but
oh
the
joy
while
doing
it
much
more
impressive
than
the
highly
regarded
lunch
wow
my
first
from
maine
and
im
very
impressed
took
my
time
with
this
one
cause
the
complexity
kept
surprising
me
will
buy
again
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
creamy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
cloudy
red
with
hints
of
orange
and
brown
leaves
some
lacing
behind
but
not
a
lot
and
in
clumps
the
smell
has
a
strong
hop
presence
with
an
even
stronger
roasted
and
caramel
malt
nose
the
caramel
malts
seem
to
dominate
the
smell
and
the
hops
compliment
it
rather
than
dominate
the
taste
is
different
from
the
smell
while
the
caramel
and
roast
malt
notes
are
still
there
the
hops
tend
to
dominate
the
pallate
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
bubbly
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
worth
getting
a
nice
hoppy
amber
strong
on
aroma
but
i
prefer
more
bittering
hops
personally
o
this
was
a
pretty
tasty

ale

very
good

poured

pours
a
medium

dark
red
amber
with
a
fine
light
twofinger
walnut
colored
head
that
kept
growing
for
quite
a
while
after

looks

a

with
a
pleasant
citrus

and
fruit
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
good
creaminess
nice
mouth
feel
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
to
have
a
lot
going
on
but
the
flavors
are
so
well
integrated
that
it
is
difficult
to
identify
them
very
pleasing
and
balanced
great
dry
malt
and
nice
hops
excellent
thanks
to
vikki
for
bringing
this
gem
back
from
maine
this
is
quite
a
hoppy
amber
ale
the
base
of
crystal
malt
is
present
enough
to
provide
a
bit
of
balance
the
hop
provides
a
black
pepper
kick
the
taste
is
too
complex
but
its
tasty
good
body
with
a
bit
of
spritziness
overall
i
generally
like
red
ales
but
i
think
this
one
is
pretty
average
the
lack
of
a
malt
in
the
taste
bothers
me
o
a
solid
maine
beer
with
the
dryhop
bitterness
combined
with
with
a
certain
amount
of
lingering
maltiness
that
is
typical
of
the
brewer
not
overpowering
in
any
aspect
but
probably
a
little
more
hoppy
than
your
normal
amber
happily
so
pours
a
deep
hazy
reddish
amber
capped
by
luxurious
two
and
half

ahints

fairly

this
brew
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
despite
being
one
of
my
least
favored
styles
delivers
in
every
category
overall
maine
beer
company
always
makes
great
hoppy
beers
this
is
a
good
beer
but
zoe
is
far
superior
when
comparing
american
amber
ales
brewed
by
maine
beer
company
maine
beer
company
beers
always
have
that
premium
mouthfeel
from
the
bottle
conditioning
which
always
distinguishes
their
beers
from
other
hoppy
beers
i
will
always
be
a
fan
of
this
east
coast
brewery
o
while
its
by
no
means
old
and
faded
ive
had
it
for
a
few
weeks
and
i
wish
i
had
drank
it
sooner
still
a
fabulous
beer
despite
my
rookie
mistake
o
definitely
a
solid
amber
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
for
the
style
but
wellmade
the
quality
of
the
beer
is
obvious
but

o
mbc
has
yet
to
disappoint
they
are
simply
producing
some
of
the
best
beers
out
there
right
now
with
a
house
flavor
all
their
own
yet
still
within
a
earshot
of
the
stated
style
id
love
to
have
this
one
in
the
summer
but
still
works
great
in
the
dead
of
november
overall
probably
the
most
disappointing
beer
ive
had
from
maine
the
hops
are
really
harsh
in
this
difficult
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
caramel
amber
with
a
massive
head
of
light
toffeecolored
creamy
midsized
bubbles
that
last
leaving
a
ring
of
sticky
fat
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
clear
and
clean
but
with
a
pronounced
haze
perhaps
from
the
heavy
use
of
hops
in
the
beer
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
richly
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
prickly
pine
the
caramel
malt
is
also
nicely
present
giving
the
nose
caramel
bread
notes
sweet
citrus
pith
is
dominant
on
the
nose
however
and
provides
a
nice
aroma
the
yeast
character
is
clean
and
faint
on
the
nose
and
as
the
beer
warms
you
do
get
a
touch
of
hot
alcohol
on
the
nose
unfortunately
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
bitter
and
softly
roasty
with
a
nice
bready
sweetness
balancing
out
the
sip
mild
citric
acidity
plays
into
the
finish
where
the
beer
dries
out
and
gives
the
tongue
a
nice
bitter
click
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
caramel
roast
almost
like
a
light
ice
coffee
with
toffee
syrup
citrus
quickly
swims
onto
the
tongue
providing
strong
grapefruit
flavors
the
finish
is
like
grapefruit
juice
with
a
touch
of
medicinal
bitters
and
caramel
bread
and
the
aftertaste
is
citric
bitters
and
sweet
toffee
and
bread
as
the
beer
warms
the
rich
malt
does
appear
more
pronounced
in
the
aftertaste
giving
off
warm
oat
bread
flavors
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
almost
light
but
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
provide
for
a
very
interesting
sip
there
is
a
slight
resiny
stickiness
left
in
the
mouth
after
the
swallow
overall
this
is
a
more
hopforward
amber
ale
but
it
gives
beautiful
malt
character
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
more
and
more
of
the
caramel
bread
can
be
sensed
in
the
beer
the
balance
ends
slightly
on
the
bitter
side
which
will
appease
any
hop
heads
but
the
malt
balance
is
also
delicious
this
beer
is
another
success
from
the
mbc
and
honestly
might
give
zoe
a
run
for
her
money
a
side
by
side
test
will
need
to
be
administered
honestly
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
all
the
maine
beers
i
feel
like
every
one
i
have
is
better
than
the
last
except
for
lunch
i
wasnt
greatly
impressed
with
it
but
i
sincerely
do
mean
it
every
time
definitely
pick
this
one
up
and
drink
it
fresh
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
imo
like
all
maine
beer
companys
beers
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
for
me
i
like
this
one
better
than
mo
and
i
enjoyed
mo
better
than
lunch
falconers
flight
might
be
the
hop
strain
for
me
even
though
its
not
a
red
ipa
but
i
pictured
flipside
tasting
more
like
this
yet
we
we
all
know
that
didnt
happen
back
to
basics
this
brew
is
recommended
unique
brew
unlike
any
other
red
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
are
unique
individually
together
they
create
an
earthy
smooth
flavor
this
brew
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
more
dense
than
my
favorite
maine
beer
co
brew
zoe
while
ill
be
perfectly
happy
grabbing
zoe
whenever
i
want
ill
grab
red
wheelbarrow
whenever
its
available
great
stuff
again
from
these
guys
overall
just
a
really
good
solid
and
balanced
amber
but
definitely
with
a
large
hop
presence
to
go
with
it
another
maine
offering
that
will
please
particularly
the
hopheads
great
drinkable
beer
nice
highs
and
lows
and
balances
odmaine
beer
company
an
almost
automatic
producer
of
delicious
beer
i
dont
mind
their
relatively
pricey
bottles
if
the
quality
will
consistently
be
this
goddamn
tasty
o
interesting
red
not
as
big
or
hoppy
as
zoe
kinda
combines
a
more
traditional
red
with
a
modern
hop
bomb
it
works
results
in
a
more
balanced
but
still
hoppy
brew
very
tasty
and
drinkable
full
bodied
with
a
blast
of
dry
earthy
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
bone
dry
finish
sticky
with
resinous
hop
oils
subtle
spiciness
grassy
pine
and
earthy
soillike
flavor
good
hop
flavor
but
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
suggests
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
lacking
the
citrustropical
fruit
sweetness
found
in
the
aroma
fortunately
there
is
plenty
of
flavorful
malt
sweetness
filling
this
need
and
balancing
things
out
nicely
strong
caramel
malt
presence
with
hints
of
toffee
biscuit
toast
and
subtle
dark
fruit
sweetness
really
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
with
no
heat
whatsoever
the
malt
backbone
perfectly
counters
the
dry
bitterness
of
the
earthy
floral
hops
similar
to
zoe
but
more
flavorful
and
better
balanced
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
hopforward
beer
easy
to
drink
overall
a
great
beer
and
another
one
well
done
from
maine
beer
co
d
i
appreciate
the
hopforward
focus
to
this
one
as
i
generally
dont
enjoy
red
ales
with
too
much
crystal
malt
to
them
surprised
maine
chose
to
do
another
red
ale
with
zoe
already
being
plenty
excellent
but
this
is
pretty
solid
as
well
as
with
other
maine
offerings
the
bitterness
is
potent
although
it
never
gets
excessive
for
my
tastes
anyway
still
probably
wouldnt
down
more
than
500ml
bottle
in
a
session
o
no
rocket
science
here
this
is
just
a
simple
pleasant
beer
dont
over
think
it
just
drink
and
enjoy
like
other
maine
brews
light
body
with
brisk
carbonation
but
full
feeling
in
the
mouth
subtle
malt
character
on

end
with
faint
dark
fruit
sweetness
very
dry
hearty
toasted
baked
breads
roll
into
big
hop
character
on
the
back
end
citrus
and
pine
slightly
earthy
and
bold
with
the
bitterness
a
floral
flavor
lingers
and
bitterness
builds
with
each
sip
hop
and
malt
combine
and
create
an
almost
savory
sensation
along
the
midpalate
a
touch
of
warm
on
the
swallow
mildly
tannic
and
mouth
scrubbing
flavors
linger
for
a
while
rustic
tasting
yet
bright
and
fresh
at
the
same
time
a
very
good
beer
and
extremely
clean
but
very
hard
to
get
and
very
expensive
in
my
area
i
prefer
zoe
hoppy
and
tasty
a
great
hoppy
amber
ok
after
a
couple
days
of
revelry
now
for
a
moment
of
reflection
and
comparison
mbcs
zoe
is
a
fine
beer
too
and
by
memory
i
couldnt
figure
out
the
difference
so
i
put
them
side
by
side
the
zoe
was
from
10813
and
the
rw
was
102213
the
nose
upfront
was
softer
and
more
floral
on
the
rw
while
the
zoe
was
richer
and
deeper
with
gobs
of
pine
mouthfeel
and
head
were
lush
and
fairly
similar
but
the
carbonation
on
the
rw
felt
lighter
the
palate
of
rw
was
loaded
with
mango
and
citrus
with
malts
that
were
light
and
sweet
kind
of
like
vanilla
and
butterscotch
swear
it
was
like
smelling
the
bark
of
a
ponderosa
pine
out
west
and
zoe
was
deeper
in
character
with
flavors
more
toward
biscuit
and
toffee
finish
on
both
was
smooth
and
lingering
wouldnt
kick
either
out
of
bed
for
eatin
crackers
slurp
o
a
good
hoppy
amber
that
borders
on
red
ipa
there
is
quite
a
malt
presence
that
backs
up
the
hops
and
mellows
them
out
a
little
thus
preserving
the
amberred
style
very
easy
to
drink
and
worth
the
5
99
price
tag
the
beer
is
well
crafted
as
mbcs
beers
are
however
it
does
not
really
do
much
for
me
because
of
the
pine
hop
profile
but
really
good
for
those
who
love
that
hop
profile
the
beer
really
reminds
me
of
zoe
red
wheelbarrow
is
youre
larger
than
average
red
ale
at
7
with
an
expressive
and
complex
hop
profile
you
dont
often
come
across
a
red
thats
this
flavorful
and
quite
frankly
exciting
another
winner
from
maine
beer
co
a
hoppy
amber
that
doesnt
push
too
far
loses
a
little
of
the
malt
and
balance
in
the
long
run
but
its
good
carries
that
maine
beer
co
profile
and
you
cant
really
lose
with
it
overall
a
big
bold
roasty
red
worth
checking
out
even
if
you
dont
dig
the
style
o
more
akin
to
torpedo
than
nugget
nectar
mellow
roasty
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
slight
chew
slight
sparkle
absolutely
a
beer
to
beer
of
you
spot
one
bitter
resiny
hops
and
a
toasted
grainy
malt
character
slightly
medicinal
hop
character
aftertaste
is
clean
and
toasty
medium
bodied
and
clean
moderate
bitterness
vaguely
sweet
and
bitter
marmalade
flavors
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
lots
of
residual
malt
sweetness
in
the
vein
of
super
fresh
alpha
king
on
a
good
day
mouthfeel
is
good
moderate
body
and
mild
carbonation
give
this
a
little
heavier
of
a
feel
which
is
great
for
the
change
of
seasons
bitterness
is
mild
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
well
balanced
red
ale
quality
hop
flavor
along
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
while
im
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
red
ales
this
one
is
very
good
so
easy
drinking
the
only
thing
that
stops
this
from
being
a
regular
of
mine
which
with
its
drinkability
and
flavor
certainly
could
be
is
its
availability
and
price
point
overall
a
terrific
hoppy
red
keep
this
hybrid
style
coming
with
reds
like
these
i
might
actually
reach
for
the
reds
more
often
had
this
the
day
after
it
hit
markets
incredibly
bland
standard
red
ale
nothing
special
here
to
call
it
hoppy
as
they
do
is
a
falacy
maybe
over
the
pond
but
not
here
in
america
and
certainly
not
compared
to
something
like
lunch
or
zoe
time
to
go
back
to
brewing
good
beer
and
not
just
being
out
to
make
money
or
at
least
make
it
less
obvious
the
latter
is
your
goal
this
is
a
treat
for
fans
of
hoppy
red
ales
on
par
with
lawsons
steves
back
yard
red
ale
2013
batch
and
almost
as
good
as
fiddlehead
ruby
claire
this
bottle
was
super
fresh
4
days
old
and
a
great
new
addition
to
the
maine
beer
co
lineup
very
full
taste
for
a
pale
ale
tastes
good
but
a
little
uneven
pine
up
front
grapefruit
in
the
middle
pine
and
a
bit
of
yeast
at
the
back
end
one
of
the
most
aggressively
hoppy
reds
ive
ever
come
across
and
while
it
was
enjoyable
the
lack
of
balance
holds
it
back
pours
a
nice
amber
red
with
a
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
pine
but
with
some
toasted
scents
coming
through
as
well
the
taste
was
expertly
balanced
with
piney
hops
coming
through
and
then
a
bit
of
the
sweet
malt
the
finish
was
very
clean
with
a
citrus
finish
that
left
you
wanting
another
sip
loved
this
one
not
usually
an
amber
fan
but
i
do
like
this
one
looks
great
deep
brown
with
a
massive
cream
colored
head
that
went
on
for
days
and
laced
in
text
book
fashion
nose
carried
a
nice
amount
of
hops
and
an
earthiness
which
i
mention
in
the
taste
on
the
backend
finishes
crisp
and
virtually
no
sweetness
hanging
around
on
the
tongue
despite
just
a
bit
in
this
well
balanced
taste
really
a
great
beer
that
i
would
not
have
thought
twice
about
had
i
not
been
drawn
to
check
out
everything
they
have
because
of
the
lunch
and
dinner
craze
this
beer
was
charming
clean
and
classy
sometimes
you
just
pull
the
right
beer
at
the
right
time
you
know
o
id
love
to
get
this
fresh
but
even
with
a
couple
months
on
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
enjoyably
hopforward
with
pine
as
its
central
note
o
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
great
flavors
and
complexity
well
crafted
and
very
hoppy
definitely
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
overall
it
was
pretty
tasty
if
it
were
easier
to
get
and
maybe
a
little
cheaper
than
7
a
bottle
id
get
it
again
poured
from
bottle
look
very
dark
amber
almost
black
huge
tan
head
sticks
around
for
awhile
head
spreads
throughout
lacing
looks
nice
smell
grassy
some
floral
notes
actually
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
better
lagunitas
nighttime
taste
good
stuff
blended
malt
hops
earthiness
smoothness
feel
surprisingly
smooth
not
much
booze
felt
o
an
interesting
well
thought
amber
ale
a
interesting
take
on
an
amber
ale
but
slightly
overhopped
to
my
tongue
which
steal
from
the
experience
b
overall
for
me
the
appearance
and
the
smell
were
the
best
things
about
this
beer
poured
16
9
oz
bottle
102114
date
into
a
samuel
smiths
pint
glass
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
nice
head
good
retention
and
nice
medium
lacing
all
the
way
down
aroma
is
a
delicious
understated
piney
hop
the
flavor
picks
up
some
of
the
darker
caramel
malts
and
is
almost
a
touch
toasted
copper
the
alcohol
is
mostly
wellhidden
but
breaks
through
at
the
back
of
the
palate
amber
ales
are
not
my
thing
but
this
is
very
nice
my
first
mbc
beer
i
will
certainly
seek
out
others
love
this
beer
one
of
the
bet
amber
beers
though
i
tend
to
like
more
flavorful
brews
zoe
has
become
a
favorite
in
my
house
due
to
its
smoothness
like
with
most
bottles
from
maine
beer
company
it
is
best
to
drink
them
within
a
couple
of
months
there
was
not
a
great
taste
to
this
bear
lacking
for
maine
beer
co
overall
though
not
bad
or
off
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
go
very
good
with
age
so
if
you
see
a
bottle
6
months
old
avoid
it
unless
hella
cheap
not
bad
at
all
nice
hoppy
sweetness
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
flavors
really
come
through
this
was
the
first
beer
i
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
its
been
fun
every
time
i
visit
massachusetts
to
drink
more
maine
beers
another
classy
beer
from
mbc
rich
and
malty
frothy
head
those
good
amber
flavors
biscuit
oat
just
a
touch
of
caramel
does
copper
have
a
taste
mbc
reminds
me
of
russian
river
in
that
their
not
experimentalists
theyre
not
releasing
bunches
of
variations
with
unusual
ingredients
they
just
take
a
beer
style
and
nail
it
giving
us
their
version
of
a
classic
recipe
they
just
make
great
beers
cant
say
enough
about
these
guys
havent
had
a
poor
beer
from
them
yet
this
is
one
of
the
top
amberreds
ive
had
right
next
to
nugget
nectar
very
tasty
amber
ale
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
recently
that
still
had
a
head
when
the
class
was
almost
empty
good
solid
beer
but
ive
had
better
from
the
folks
at
maine
beer
company
i
thought
the
softness
of
the
malt
in
this
was
remarkable
but
that
the
flavor
was
lacking
in
boldness
it
could
have
been
more
dynamic
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
smells
of
pine
citrus
and
a
little
chocolate
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
a
lot
of
roasty
chocolaty
malts
complemented
by
pine
and
citrus
hops
some
dark
fruit
in
there
too
this
isnt
as
much
a
hoppy
amber
as
it
is
a
black
ipa
much
darker
and
roastier
than
other
hoppy
ambers
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
and
carbonation
is
pretty
low
i
usually
like
my
hoppy
beers
to
be
lighter
and
crisper
overall
a
pretty
good
amber
mbc
definitely
did
their
own
thing
with
it
maybe
im
hitting
a
bit
low
here
its
just
not
my
favorite
mbc
beer
still
top
quality
a
fantastic
version
of
the
style
which
i
dont
care
for
all
that
much
ill
take
any
other
mbc
over
it
but
id
take
this
over
most
other
red
ales
overall
balling

me
from
purchasing
it
its
an
amber
ale
after
all
i
dont
comprehend
the
price
for
such
a
beer
so
i
finally
gave
in
and
tried
it

o
good

maine
brewing
company
zoe
pours
out
the
dark
amber
i
envisioned
a
nice
dark
amber
with
some
light
brown
shade
and
a
tannish
cap
of
foam
up
top
leaving
good
amounts
of
foam
on
the
glass
a
decent
amount
of
bubbles
rising
up
smells
awfully
hoppy
right
off
the
tap
a
nice
mix
of
pineearth
backed
with
citrus
trace
amounts
of
pale
malt
ride
up
the
tail
end
smells
awfully
clean
and
ready
to
drink
drinking
this
is
nice
what
is
advertised
is
delivered
a
hoppy
amber
ale
the
amount
of
biscuit
coming
from
the
malt
drives
down
this
nicely
hopped
ale
into
something
more
balanced
leading
in
the
amber
directon
caramel
seeps
through
gently
and
glides
with
the
earthpinecitrus
feel
is
a
step
up
from
light
with
a
nice
carb
that
is
felt
i
could
do
a
pint
of
this
if
the
day
and
mood
was
right
i
just
dont
see
myself
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
reminds
me
of
celebration
ale
95100
what
a
pleasure
so
good
i
want
to
remember
this
one
the
way
i
had
this
bottle
so
awesomely
fresh
dont
know
if
id
get
it
again
if
it
was
much
older
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
encountered
including
nugget
nectar
d
not
bad
the
aroma
is
quite
nicely
put
together
but
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
work
quite
as
well
the
bitterness
is
kind
of
soapy
and
the
hop
character
just
isnt
as
bright
as
it
was
in
the
aroma
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
was
disappointed
that
that
the
intense
fruity
hoppiness
seemed
to
fade
as
the
liquid
warmed
to
those
of
you
who
plan
on
drinking
this
i
would
recommend
doing
so
quickly
and
rather
cold
in
order
to
enjoy
all
of
its
hoppy
glory
o
a
solid
hoppy
amber
thats
well
balanced
between
a
sizable
caramel
malty
body
and
palatesmacking
hops
right
up
there
with
arrogant
bastard
for
me
a
little
more
malty
with
more
citrus
perfect
o
while
i
feel
it
exceeds
the
light
to
moderate
hopping
typical
of
a
redarent
most
beers
these
days
this
a
great
beer
fresh
and
sweet
well
done
flavor
is
floral
and
citrus
resiny
and
sappy
moving
to
piney
notes
some
orange
rind
pith
understated
caramel
and
toffee
malt
rides
beneath
but
gets
pushed
back
down
by
the
hops
malt
rises
up
more
strongly
as
it
warms
and
brings
nuances
of
crusty
bread
and
dried
leaves
dry
and
crisp
finishes
tingly
great
beer
this
is
full
flavored
and
well
done
i
usually
prefer
a
little
more
malt
balance
but
there
is
no
complaining
on
this
beauty
may
have
to
pick
up
that
sixtel
my
distributor
has
o
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorites
highly
recommend
this
is
a
special
ale
from
a
special
brewery
overall
not
as
uniquely
complex
as
i
was
expecting
but
not
as
bitter
either
fantastic
aromatics
perhaps
that
is
why
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
not
completely
blown
away
but
definitely
not
a
bad
brew
either
i
would
pair
this
with
game
and
poultry
fish
and
chips
and
pork
dishes
with
all
due
respect
to
the
american
amberred
ale
style
i
did
not
have
high
expectations
but
maine
beer
pulled
it
off
its
incredibly
balanced
nicely
cooked
and
very
refreshing
much
like
peeper
and
lunch
this
is
remarkably
good
ill
be
shocked
if
they
can
make
a
bad
beer
carbonation
was
a
little
lower
than
i
like
medium
body
overall
a
flavorful
well
balanced
amber
ale
mbc
knows
how
to
handle
their
hops
and
it
shows
with
zoe
poured
into
a
13

glass
pours
a

with

highlights
2

that
takes

settling
gorgeous

tangerine
pineapple
pine
and
some

taste
is
all
of
that
with
a
little
hint
of
carmel
in
the
finish
really
well
balanced
most
dominant
flavor
tangerine
by
a
tiny
margin
body
is
really
nice
a
little
on

the
perfect

hello
maine
beer
company
welcome
to
new
hampshire
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
says
the
date
of
102711
on
it
hard
to
walk
past
this
when
fresh
o
this
beer
was
all
over
the
place
not
in
a
bad
way
its
just
that
the
smell
didnt
jive
with
the
taste
and
the
taste
didnt
jive
with
he
mouthfeel
which
didnt
seem
typical
for
the
style
i
just
dont
know
how
to
react
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
great
brew
but
for
the
style
idk
its
just
wacky
i
guess
loved
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
guess
o
whoa
mama
what
an
american
amber
the
7
2
abv
pushes
this
beer
into
the
stratosphere
of
american
strong
ale
with
its
complex
fruity
and
smoky
malt
profile
combined
with
lush
bitter
hops
that
provide
a
fullrange
of
flavors
a
really
nice
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
grabbing
again
and
even
aging
a
bit
to
see
where
things
go
this
is
really
a
very
good
and
rather
unusual
ale
cant
wait
to
try
more
maine
beer
co
brews
o
maine
beer
company
has
not
disappointed
me
at
all
every
one
of
their
beers
provides
a
unique
take
on
each
style
it
represents
i
could
drink
their
beer
all
day
o
this
was
perfect
for
a
colder
day
nice
and
hearty
with
the
malt
inviting
and
a
little
refreshing
with
the
hop
they
achieved
a
nice
balance
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
another
if
only
i
were
in
maine
o
i
love
any
time
i
can
spend
in
maine
maine
beer
company
has
created
yet
more
reasons
for
me
to
appreciate
the
state
four
more
reasons
with
zoe
being
one
of
my
top
2
along
with
lunch
peeper
and
mean
old
tom
are
right
there
too
fresher
releases
are
much
more
complex
as
expected
this
is
a
special
ale
from
a
young
brewery
to
watch
and
of
course
to
try
when
possible
distribution
has
just
been
expanded
to
nh
and
vt
along
with
boston
ma
also
nyc
i
believe
the
price
is
a
natural
drawback
but
doesnt
reduce
the
quality
o
well
worth
seeking
out
if
youve
not
had
it
as
my
friend
would
say
quite
a
tasty
treat
my
aunt
and
uncle
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
while
they
were
in
maine
a
month
or
so
ago
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
looking
amber
color
in
darker
light
it
looked
brown
the
head
was
white
and
had
a
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
hoppy
there
wasnt
too
much
else
really
happening
besides
some
citrusy
hops
filling
the
nose
the
taste
is
bitter
but
yet
dry
drinkable
in
my
opinion
has
some
sweetness
in
the
flavor
also
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
pretty
good
carbonation
to
it
also
overall
i
thought
this
brew
was
really
good
actually
i
would
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
zoe
pours
a
rustic
chestnutbrown
hue
and
is
topped
with
a
sturdy
cap
of
sudsy
tan
froth
the
nose
is
sweet
imparting
mapleish
tones
and
it
is
spicy
in
an
earthy
sense
there
also
is
quite
a
bit
of
discernible
alcohol
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
offers
a
bit
of
toastyroasty
nuttiness
atop
the
sweetness
as
well
as
an
earthyherbal
understated
hoppiness
unfortunately
it
is
again
unpleasantly
alcoholic
especially
for
7
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
terribly
special
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
amber
good
sturdy
hop
profile
with
a
good
imbalance
that
allows
the
hops
to
carry
the
load
but
the
malts
are
showcased
as
well
overall
great
beer
with
ambers
its
tough
to
be
overthetop
impressive
in
any
category
so
im
always
looking
for
that
beer
that
delivers
in
every
category
this
one
comes
damn
close
very
nice
beer
overall
this
is
an
impressive
beer
i
am
definitely
a
huge
fan
of
the
red
ale
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
as
a
lover
of
hoppy
red
ales
i
just
have
to
say
that
im
in
love
with
this
beer
from
its
beautiful
look
to
its
flavorful
yet
well
balanced
profiles
to
its
super
easy
drinkability
this
one
just
all
the
right
notes
for
me
the
other
two
maine
beers
ive
had
peeper
lunch
got
close
for
me
but
this
is
the
first
one
to
really
knock
it
out
of
the
park
as
i
think
this
is
definitely
the
freshest
that
ive
been
able
to
try
one
of
their
beers
im
super
excited
to
here
that
this
is
going
to
be
distributed
in
se
pa
going
forward
as
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
bottles
overall
this
beer
had
a
nice
flavor
profile
and
was
very
easy
to
consume
worthy
of
a
try
by
anyone
who
likes
the
style
hopefully
a
fresher
bottle
is
better
m
light
to
medium
body
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
pours
a
dark
rusty
copper
color
with
thick
pillow
of
dense
offwhite
to
khaki
head
good
retention
and
lacing
strong
hop
aroma
brings
notes
of
pine
resin
with
pungent
citrus
and
light
medicinal
notes
moderate
amounts
of
toasted
bread
and
nuts
with
a
faint
hint
of
caramel
taste
again
brings
the
hops
big
and
bitter
citrus
and
pine
again
a
faint
herbalmedicinal
note
malt
backbone
is
firm
light
toasted
bread
and
nuts
with
a
lightly
sweet
caramel
note
hints
of
earth
like
a
muted
scotch
ale
medium
bodied
smooth
and
oily
dry
finish
a
really
nice
hoppy
amber
with
a
solid
but
not
sweet
malt
presence
zoes
label
is
simple
but
appropriate
the
smiley
face
looking
out
at
me
right
now
mirrors
my
own
a
balanced
drinkable
flavorful
mighty
fine
hoppy
amber
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
that
im
fond
of
extremely
good
when
fresh
initially
at
the
front
end
it
tastes
like
roasted
barley
with
a
slight
nib
of
dark
chocolate
and
i
expect
that
to
follow
differently
than
the
fruitycitrus
driven
hopsplosion
that
ensues
fresh
grassiness
and
smoked
woodchips
finish
it
out
with
a
lingering
chalky
malt
and
sour
hop
tingle
very
interesting
brew
i
like
it
a
lot
try
one
o
by
far
the
best
ive
tasted
in
this
style
cant
drink
too
much
of
this
or
rather
its
easy
to
drink
too
much
of
this
but
it
really
exemplifies
the
juxtaposition
of
balance
complexity
bottle
given
to
me
by
cavedave
thanks
man
pours
brown
only
letting
light
through
the
edges
and
with
a
nice
big
root
beer
float
head
looks
great
smells
like
a
hoppy
brown
ale
nice
light
caramel
and
nutty
toffee
flavor
very
nice
the
taste
is
extremely
interesting
the
malty
and
caramel
nuttiness
of
the
amber
makes
it
come
off
as
a
brown
ale
this
is
balanced
by
a
pretty
strong
dose
of
hops
which
come
together
really
well
drinks
very
easy
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
beer
made
by
ale
asylum
in
madison
wi
which
is
a
pretty
random
connection
i
like
this
one
a
lot
nice
carbonation
and
good
body
this
beer
is
really
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
reddishbrown
haze
even
the
foam
had
a
reddish
hue
almost
looked
like
a
fresh
ripe
fig
fantastic
looking
smelled
very
very
hoppy
but
the
taste
wasnt
overwhelmed
with
hops
very
hoppy
initial
flavour
but
finished
very
crisp
malty
and
like
a
red
ale
should
an
amazing
unique
beer
it
is
in
my
personal
top
10
maybe
20
beers
i
ever
had
buy
it
if
you
see
it
i
just
wish
the
bottle
was
bigger
it
should
also
be
noted
that
this
is
one
of
the
simplest
but
coolest
labels
in
all
of
beerdom
o
very
enjoyable
amber
ale
smells
great
tastes
great
and
works
really
well
for
me
very
enjoyable
beer
i
really
wish
this
was
something
i
could
get
regularly
nice
beer
here
a
very
good
hoppy
brew
i
would
prefer
more
caramel
notes
and
less
tropical
fruit
hops
but
i
am
being
picky
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
o
this
is
really
quite
good
with
an
earthy
tone
to
all
the
flavors
id
definitely
like
the
flavor
transitions
to
be
a
bit
more
clear
but
i
imagine
having
a
fresher
bottle
will
give
a
much
more
dynamic
experience
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
but
some
gaps
in
the
mouth
feel
definitely
made
me
wish
i
had
a
super
fresh
bottle
to
determine
where
the
error
was
stemmed
from
another
very
solid
beer
from
maine
beer
co
phuck
yeah
maine
beer
co
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
finish
lingers
with
a
slightly
bitter
earthy
flavor
awesomeness
from
maine
beer
company
this
is
a
very
highquality
rye
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
and
well
balanced
hoppy
amber
id
grab
this
often
if
it
was
a
local
option
ill
happily
finish
this
bottle
zoe
pours
a
really
really
deep
red
like
clay
red
huge
puffy
off
tanlight
tan
head
tight
tight
carb
and
a
biteo
sheeting
just
a
hair
to
dark
on
the
color
for
me
super
fresh
olfactory
over
load
of
hops
big
piney
and
resinous
hops
light
citrus
undertones
massivley
pithy
and
piney
red
ale
here
but
wait
theres
more
fruity
flavors
and
malty
flavors
too
a
well
pronounced
malt
backbone
a
slightly
lingering
bitter
hopbitter
chocolate
finish
im
buying
more
of
this
stuff
this
beer
was
so
insanely
fresh
all
should
seak
this
out
had
this
one
on
my
wants
for
a
while
since
hoppy
ambers
are
my
favorite
style
i
was
not
let
down
very
complex
flavor
profile
i
would
love
to
compare
one
of
these
to
a
fresh
nugget
nectar
next
spring
it
is
an
interesting
one
for
sure
taste
is
hearty
grain
husks
to
start
comes
on
strong
in
the
middle
with
citrus
hops
with
a
smooth
segue
into
the
prominent
bitterness
which
lingers
with
a
light
alcohol
warming
mouthfeel
is
smooth
maybe
a
touch
grainy
and
drinkability
is
good
nice
fall
brew
even
if
its
available
more
often
than
that
o
a
great
beer
again
oi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
classy
tasty
and
drinkable
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
i
kind
of
wish
it
was
in
a
six
pack
rather
than
a
500ml
great
beer
though
i
am
not
to
familiar
with
red
ales
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
rich
deep
copper
with
a
twofinger
thick
dark
cream
head
great
lacing
and
the
head
goes
nowhere
sweet
citrus
aroma
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
lead
also
a
hint
of
tropical
mango
notes
this
is
a
well
hopped
amber
starts
innocent
enough
with
slight
notes
of
grapefruit
before
a
bitter
earthy
and
pine
kick
comes
through
solid
caramel
malt
adds
sweet
and
creaminess
before
a
big
hoppy
finish
bitter
citrus
notes
some
grassy
flavors
and
more
pine
bring
it
home
big
flavorful
amber
from
this
impressive
brewery
pours
a
deep
hazy
amber
offwhite
head
slowly
turns
to
a
thick
film
moderate
lacing
big
time
hops
in
the
aroma
citrus
grapefruit
floral
some
sweet
malt
hidden
in
the
background
very
pleasant
taste
is
well
balanced
mild
bitterness
sweet
malts
caramel
the
aftertaste
gives
me
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
sweet
malt
as
well
as
grassy
floral
hops
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
complex
and
well
executed
it
reminds
me
of
a
black
ipa
malts
and
hops
are
both
assertive
and
demand
attention
they
play
off
each
other
wonderfully
full
flavors
and
a
beer
i
will
recommend
to
friends
overall
i
wont
lie
i
didnt
understand
why
people
loved
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
or
the
second
or
even
the
third
but
it
finally
clicked
nicely
balanced
with
an
assertive
hop
character
but
an
equally
solid
malt
profile
also
this
beer
helps
save
whales
very
wellconceived
and
accomplished
big
amberred
ale
o
wish
i
had
gotten
to
this
earlier
to
get
more
of
the
hop
notes
but
its
still
delicious
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
made
me
a
fan
of
ambers
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
cigar
city
tocobaga
i
had
a
couple
weeks
back
but
with
a
darker
malt
backbone
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
it
hoppy
amber
ales
are
slowly
becoming
my
favorite
style
because
of
there
balance
of
malt
and
hops
highly
recommended
and
worth
seeking
out
i
know
i
will
be
o
another
highly
flavorful
and
balanced
brew
from
maine
beer
co
they
are
doing
things
right
overall
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
perfect
beer
by
any
means
but
it
tastes
fantastic
im
really
loving
it
and
would
definitely
have
another
poured
into
a
true
pint
glass
a
very
nice
cloudy
dark
amber

very
nice

had
to
date
thanks
bill

amber
with
a
1

quite
a
bit

a

evidently
from

7
a
bottle
this
is
a
great
beer
with
all
the
breweries
pulling
out
of
this
area
i
am
happy
that
we
are
able
to
find
jems
like
this
not
sure
if
it
out
of
code
but
it
sure
tasted
good
it
has
a
smile
on
the
front
of
the
lable
and
it
sure
put
one
on
mine
another
fantastic
offering
from
maine
brewing
lunch
is
spectacular
and
this
is
not
far
behind
if
you
can
get
one
try
it
youll
be
glad
you
did
overall
a
very
good
hoppy
amber
ale
exactly
how
i
like
my
ambers
o
a
great
hoppy
amber
something
id
love
to
drink
regularly
good
beer
that
i
will
try
to
acquire
more
of
when
im
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
beer
frankly
this
is
growing
on
me
and
im
a
little
pissed
i
only
picked
up
a
couple
bottles
i
was
too
focused
on
lunch
lesson
learned
well
done
folks
though
i
prefer
my
amber
ales
a
little
hoppier
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
mbc
its
not
trying
to
be
nugget
nectar
and
for
what
it
is
its
successful
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
well
balanced
beer
that
grew
on
me
significantly
as
i
sipped
though
at
first
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
strong
malt
character
this
same
character
proved
to
perfectly
balance
with
the
strong
hops
up
front
and
in
the
nose
the
results
a
wonderful
amber
truly
worth
trying
o
910
a
hoppy
amber
to
be
sure
but
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
overall
not
a
bad
hoppy
amber
but
i
have
had
much
better
i
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
a
more
active
dry
hopping
and
less
of
a
the
bittering
hops
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
from
maine
beer
company
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
another
great
beer
from
the
maine
beer
company
the
beer
looks
amazing
when
poured
i
nice
medium
head
with
a
brown
amber
color
the
smell
is
pretty
good
nothing
outstanding
the
taste
however
is
outstanding
with
great
hops
and
hint
of
sweetness
the
mouthful
is
pretty
good
but
expected
a
bit
more
overall
definitely
a
beer
id
recommend
to
any
beer
drinker
well
done
again
od
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
ive
ever
seen
and
definitely
the
bet
looking
amberbrown
ale
tastes
great
to
boot
with
great
roasted
malt
character
and
a
strong
hop
presence
was
expecting
a
bit
more
hop
presence
given
the
freshness
but
zoe
is
a
very
good
beer
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
keep
it
coming
maine

this

excellent

flavors
with
a
sweet

that
brings
a
nice

the

are
the
showcase
here
and
they
dont
disappoint
this
beer
was
extremely
fresh
being

it

the

are
strange

it
almost

an

though
i
cant
be

definitely
a
strange
beer
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
attractive
amber
beer
with
a
strong

not
overly
hoppy
strikes
a
good

completely
recommend
picking
this
up
if
you
see
it
though
it
is
listed
on
ba
as
an
american
amber
ale
this
is
almost
a
strong
ale
i
guess
imperial
red
ale
would
work
too
o
big
hoppy
reds
are
a
favorite
of
mine
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
nice
hops
and
malt
in
the
flavor
make
this
one
easy
to
drink
worth
getting
if
you
see
it
around
o
very
tasty
and
im
usually
not
the
biggest
amber
fan
outside
of
nugget
nectar
the
mintchocolate
thing
adds
a
nice
level
of
complexity
that
i
wasnt
expecting
great
beer
o
a
perfectly
balanced
hoppy
beer
with
pleasant
and
subtle
sweetness
and
spiciness
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
d
drinks
quite
nicely
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
to
maine
every
time
i
wanted
one
o
great
beer
neither
the
malt
or
hops
are
overpowering
they
stand
on
their
own
and
also
make
a
great
combination
at
the
same
time
i
would
say
that
this
is
second
only
to
nugget
nectar
thats
saying
a
lot
at
least
maine
went
with
the
traditional
spelling
though
i
dont
have
too
much
against
zooey
a
very
nice
amber
great
finish
id
have
it
again
for
sure
drabmuhjul

and
their
mission
statement
makes
me
want
to
love
it
ill
have
to
give
this
another
try
down
the
line
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
without
getting
in
the
way
of
the
hops
usually
i
dislike
hoppy
beers
with
this
strong
of
a
malt
presence
but
here
it
creates
perfect
balance
and
adds
another
layer
of
complexity

from

while
not
quite
as
good
a
new

fat

i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
and
be
very
happy
smooth
despite
darker
appearance
in
glass
very
average
not
much
to
it
its
great
so
i
gave
it
a
great
score
that
is
all
the
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
shade
of
deep
reddish
brown
with
the
perfect
head
but
thats
where
the
beauty
really
ends
the
taste
is
very
average
a
little
bitter
for
such
a
timid
beer
and
you
dont
feel
like
youll
really
remember
drinking
it
after
youre
done
solid
but
not
really
anything
special
not
as
amber
colored
as
most
but
very
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
a
decent
amber
ale
that
is
fairly
light
and
nothing
too
big
or
memorable
as
far
as
flavor
goes
still
not
bad
easy
drinking
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pretty
good
flavor
and
pretty
light
not
too
strong
so
nice
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
many
people
dont
think
this
beer
is
that
good
but
i
dont
understand
why
its
a
great
warmweather
or
session
beer
light
and
ambery
but
not
too
pale
nice
clear
color
crisp
taste
nothing
too
adventurous
but
great
to
have
around
in
the
cooler
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
even
though
it
is
considered
just
ok
an
easy
drinker
great
session
ale
flavor
is
very
basic
so
ill
just
give
it
a
4
although
i
enjoy
basic
in
many
beers
overall
its
a
session
amber
and
one
without
much
flavor
but
it
doesnt
bring
much
else
to
the
table
other
than
its
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
no
major
complaints
but
nothing
too
crazy
either
sort
of
a
slightly
better
fat
tire
vein
here
its
a
good
beer
o
a
nice
amber
ale
that
would
be
pretty
easy
to
clean
out
a
cooler
full
probably
would
pair
well
with
a
good
juicy
steak
or
some
kind
of
smoked
meat
big
thanks
to
kw
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
nothing
special
here
its
easy
to
drink
and
inoffensive
i
wouldnt
run
out
trying
to
find
this
one
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
could
be
a
fine
grilling
companion
the
4
pct
abv
gives
this
away
as
the
malt
required
to
amp
up
the
flavor
is
not
there
and
it
is
simply
too
weak
i
like
this
amber
ale
not
overly
carbonated
nice
color
doesnt
leave
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
and
very
drinkable
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
foamy
head
but
thats
okay
i
think
its
true
to
its
kind
and
would
not
be
impossible
to
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
also
doesnt
need
food
to
appease
the
palate
although
it
would
accompany
a
nice
pizza
or
deli
sandwich
steak
or
chicken
dish
with
no
problem
would
buy
again
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of

on

of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
slight
caramel
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
slight
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
toasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
seems
fairly
watery
and
lacking
all
around
overall
drinkable
for
me
but
not
enough
not

not

would
i
drink
this
again
if
its
on
tap
id
definitely
give
it
another
shot
however
there
are
other
beers
akin
to
this
one
id
rather
buy
avalanche
is
a
great
amber
with
a
clean
refreshing
taste
i
was
very
surprised
to
find
it
at
the
local
grocery
chain
in
the
cleveland
area
even
though
it
has
traveled
through
many
states
it
tastes
almost
as
fresh
as
having
one
in
breckenridge
this
is
my
favorite
among
colorado
beers
d
overall
pleasant
not
award
winning
but
great
for
any
occasion
atmosphere
is
okay
decent
head
and
fair
lacing
buttery
bready
woody
nose
bitter
wood
chips
and
citrus
pith
overshadow
the
bready
malt
grains
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
not
a
bad
tasting
amber
beer
just
not
enough
of
the
taste
it
has
if
the
taste
of
this
beer
were
more
pronounced
it
might
actually
be
a
pretty
good
drink
othis
is
a
pretty
mediocre
effort
the
hops
are
nearly
nonexistent
and
the
malts
are
not
terribly
interesting
i
dont
know
if
my
bottle
was
too
old
but
i
could
not
get
over
the
grainy
metallic
note
that
i
detected
on
my
first
whiff
the
barley
and
grains
do
provide
flavor
versus
a
bmc
brew
but
i
dont
know
if
that
flavor
is
worth
partaking
in
overall
slight
upgrade
from
generic
miller
light
and
bud
generic
looking
subpar
smell
with
a
bitter
taste
throughout
with
minimal
floral
and
caramel
hints
stick
with
the
miller
and
save
yourself
a
couple
of
bucks
would
not
buy
again
overall

0
good
basic
beer
nothing
special
reminiscent
of
another
colorado
brewerys
famous
beer
namely
new
belgiums
fat
tire
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
certainly
nothing
extraordinary
nothing
stands
out
but
theres
nothing
bad
either
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
but
is
very
mild
it
seems
typical
for
the
style
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
more
robust
american
pilsner
might
buy
again
if
i
want
something
light
and
smooth
but
a
little
more
robust
than
a
wheat
type
beer
the
bodys
a
little
thinner
and
lighter
than
it
should
be
but
otherwise
its
standard
stuff
moderate
carbonation
lends
itself
to
an
adequate
overall
feel
im
not
feeling
this
one
its
amber
in
color
and
its
hop
presence
is
far
back
for
what
an
american
might
be
on
the
lookout
for
its
taste
im
tempted
to
say
its
an
off
color
golden
ale
and
nearly
lagerish
in
the
mouth
so
its
far
more
on
the
malt
side
of
things
and
probably
should
be
paired
with
a
sandwich
and
salad
to
bring
it
alive
by
itself
im
enjoying
the
nose
more
than
i
am
the
beer
itself
or
perhaps
i
need
to
try
it
again
in
the
summer
time
when
this
kind
of
flavor
profile
has
something
more
to
work
with
it
smells
of
some
brown
sugar
and
possibly
a
bit
sour
and
some
of
the
grain
is
coming
in
with
a
slight
plum
presence
ill
bury
one
for
a
hotter
day
but
at
the
moment
this
is
not
a
beer
i
anticipate
ill
be
looking
for
in
the
future
odvery
bland
nothing
offputting
i
guess
it
could
work
if
you
want
something
really
light
that
you
will
never
ever
remember
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
an
astringent
finish
which
is
accented
by
a
higher
carbonation
level
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
would
like
a
touch
more
malt
and
more
floral
hop
notes
but
still
mostly
clean
o
not
a
good
beer
but
better
than
your
bmc
stuff
lots
of
work
left
to
do
on
this
one
bring
out
some
hops
on
it
please
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
amber
with
shortlived
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
caramel
malt
some
fruit
and
staleness
body
is
medium
and
smooth
grassy
hops
sweet
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
too
much
of
it
combine
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
and
semisweet
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
the
brew
o
over
all
it
was
ok
ive
had
far
far
worse
but
this
just
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
except
for
the
cool
looking
bottle
probably
wont
have
it
again
a
drinkable
enough
ale
nothing
special
and
lacking
in
aroma
hours
clear
amber
color
with
a
lasting
white
head
a
slight
caramel
and
toffee
on
the
nose
but
also
wet
cardboard
smells
like
an
adjunct
lager
taste
is
also
like
an
adjunct
lager
a
touch
of
light
caramel
and
toffee
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
balanced
and
remains
very
drinkable
but
its
a
forget
table
taste
overall
i
dont
know
if
i
have
a
watered
down
version
because
of
the
alcohol
laws
here
or
its
just
a
mediocre
brew
rjt
every
monday
the
brewery
has
1
pints
night
maybe
they
are
giving
us
what
we
pay
for
wow
this
is
pretty
boring
mild
and
minimally
sweet
bready
malt
character
a
little
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
very
little
hops
coming
through
light
to
medium
body
and
low
to
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
exactly
a
beer
with
character
you
can
certainly
find
many
more
apt
choices
if
youre
looking
for
an
amber
or
red
ale
this
one
is
pretty
good
for
a
non
beer
geek
a
decent
non
offensive
brew
i
poured
this
flat
dull
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
cloudy
looking
and
poured
a
very
poor
head
the
smelled
smelled
pretty
good
kinda
sweet
like
caramel
candy
i
had
high
hopes
however
the
taste
was
fruity
kinda
like
spoiled
wine
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
terrible
refreshing
and
clean
the
brewerys
website
says
this
is
their
bestselling
beer
that
probably
has
something
to
do
with
the
simple
and
easydrinking
aspect
of
it
i
thought
it
was
very
pleasant
and
went
down
nice
with
my
dinner
overall
seems
strangely
mild
and
bland
for
an
amber
its
ok
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
amber
almost
medium
bodied
with
a
faint
effervescence
as
ive
come
to
expect
with
cask
ales
decent
but
gotta
say
after
almost
a
half
dozen
im
not
loving
the
cask
even
with
familiar
brews
they
are
coming
across
weak
and
almost
watery
the
lower
carbonation
is
fine
but
where
does
the
body
go
final
thoughts
i
wish
there
had
been
a
little
more
to
this
beer
maybe
in
body
or
the
selection
of
malts
used
its
a
little
too
generic
however
itd
be
the
perfect
selection
for
someone
who
is
new
to
craft
beer
ouch
this
is
a
rough
one
on
the
first
sip
i
can
tell
that
this
is
not
too
good
the
load
of
malts
is
too
thick
with
no
additional
flavors
bleh
this
is
pretty
bad
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
definitely
wont
be
able
to
finish
it
o
really
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
not
offensive
by
any
means
just
bland
cant
see
myself
tryin
this
beer
out
again
o
amber
ales
as
a
whole
are
pretty
boring
and
this
one
does
absolutely
nothing
to
stand
out
from
the
bunch
o
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
prefer
this
beer
to
be
a
little
more
hoppy
it
is
just
a
malt
bomb
and
is
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
would
like
this
is
definitely
sessionable
the
beer
is
well
made
with
no
defects
and
the
slight
bitterness
and
lack
of
excessive
sweetness
would
make
this
a
good
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
daily
drinker
for
any
season
pours
to
a
thin
creamy
head
and
amber
color
clear
aroma
is
clean
and
sweet
malt
and
slight
butter
flavor
is
a
mild
and
very
tasty
biscuit
caramel
sweet
malty
mixture
offset
by
unobtrusive
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
co2
is
a
pleasant
low
level
overall
this
is
a
balanced
mild
amber
session
brew
that
i
would
put
in
my
kegerator
in
a
heartbeat
mo
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
not
to
memorable
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
several
in
a
row
o
decent
but
quite
forgettable
there
are
many
amber
ales
i
prefer
so
i
dont
see
myself
heading
back
to
this
one
any
time
soon
o
this
beer
would
probably
pair
well
with
food
but
no
more
much
than
that
it
really
needs
some
more
hops
to
make
this
a
beer
that
would
be
interesting
to
drink
on
its
own
this
is
a
tasty
ale
it
is
also
seems
lighter
than
it
is
it
has
a
low
abv
and
can
be
drank
in
large
quantities
o
overall
avalanche
amber
is
a
pretty
solid
malty
amber
that
is
worth
a
try
this
is
a
flashback
to
the
birth
of
craft
beer
movement
type
of
amber
ale
does
not
appeal
to
this
drinker
anymore
the
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
isnt
very
impressive
i
wouldnt
say
its
bad
but
there
are
much
better
offerings
o
easy
drinker
good
for
a
few
if
it
was
only
just
a
bit
more
robust
this
one
is
not
worth
a
second
look
it
is
just
another
beer
on
the
shelf
while
i
finished
this
bottle
it
is
clearly
intended
for
those
who
do
not
discern
the
nuances
of
flavor
or
aroma
it
is
possible
that
this
bottle
was
out
of
date
but
that
certainly
cannot
explain
its
overall
mediocre
nature
ov
good
sipping
beer
especially
for
people
who
may
not
be
really
into
craft
beer
yet
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
repeatable
this
beer
is
fairly
well
balanced
but
it
doesnt
have
a
very
distinct
profile
the
malts
are
a
bit
to
sweet
and
leave
a
sort
of
metallic
aftertaste
which
is
a
little
offputting
it
needs
more
distinctive
flavors
and
with
all
of
the
really
good
amber
ales
that
are
readily
available
i
probably
wont
buy
or
serve
it
again
o
very
enjoyable
brew
the
drinkability
is
great
and
the
flavors
are
just
strong
enough
and
varied
enough
to
hold
interest
but
mellow
overall
by
definition
this
amber
ale
is
fairly
average
for
the
style
a
drinker
that
likes
amber
ales
would
likely
find
it
acceptable
most
drinkers
need
not
have
it
more
than
once
not
bad
an
accessible
winter
seasonal
for
those
who
prefer
such
a
thing
the
taste
which
is
always
the
most
important
thing
was
really
good
for
an
amber
ale
first
time
trying
a
sampler
from
this
brewery
and
avalanche
was
a
great
flavor
has
a
rich
caramel
malt
flavor
but
only
a
very
tiny
hop
finish
i
am
very
hit
and
miss
with
this
one
when
via
the
bottle
and
more
times
than
notits
a
miss
pours
amber
with
a
minimal
prickly
white
head
smell
is
diluted
but
what
is
there
is
on
the
sweet
side
from
the
malts
flavor
wise
is
usually
a
watered
down
caramel
malt
sweetness
just
a
pinch
of
hops
at
the
end
when
i
do
get
a
good
bottle
though
i
find
that
like
it
a
lot
and
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
moutfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
carbonation
overall
i
stopped
buying
this
one
because
i
was
finding
i
was
getting
watery
batches
way
too
frequently
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottling
info
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
fairly
dense
2
finger
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
bready
grain
light
citrus
and
spiciness
fairly
nice
aromas
with
good
strength
taste
of
caramel
bready
grains
herbal
spiciness
pine
and
a
bit
of
citrus
decent
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
bready
grains
herbal
spiciness
and
light
caramel
the
breadiness
and
grain
flavors
are
a
bit
odd
decent
amount
of
flavor
but
it
does
come
off
as
a
bit
watery
medium
carbonation
and
lightmedium
body
with
some
prickly
carbonation
very
smooth
to
drink
at
4
4
with
no
alcohol
presence
overall
this
is
an
ok
amber
ale
a
little
too
bready
and
not
as
much
hop
character
as
i
would
like
easy
to
drink
though
its
hard
to
believe
that
theres
any
alcohol
in
this
since
i
couldnt
taste
it
and
the
carbonation
was
practically
nonexistent
this
beer
reminded
me
a
bit
of
the
agave
wheat
since
the
back
was
so
light
and
had
a
bit
of
that
fruittype
feel
to
it
this
is
only
worth
a
try
for
the
diehard
breckenridge
fans
and
although
i
like
these
guys
for
the
lighter
offerings
that
they
bring
to
the
table
this
just
didnt
cut
it
for
me
it
was
decently
sessionable
but
not
great
overall
taste
like
a
macro
micro
overall
a
pretty
light
ale
pretty
good
flavor
but
thin
feel
serving
type
bottle
overall
i
had
to
comeback
and
edit
my
review
this
is
simply
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
i
like
its
biscuit
and
buttery
profile
a
lot
great
all
year
long
overall
i
normally
dont
like
amber
ales
but
this
one
is
so
watered
down
its
not
as
bad
to
me
haha
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
presents
a
hazy
rubyamber
coloring
with
a
split
second
of
thin
head
that
completely
disappears
within
moments
rich
caramel
and
toffee
aromas
with
a
slight
roastedtoasted
characteristic
the
beers
flavors
are
extremely
watered
down
giving
the
malty
profiles
a
wierd
uncomfortable
tang
the
roastiness
comes
out
in
a
rusty
flavor
not
good
tasting
any
way
you
look
at
it
the
watery
characteristic
gives
off
a
metallic
aftertaste
on
the
light
body
the
finish
is
nondecript
after
everything
else
there
are
much
better
ambers
out
there
folks
beer
is
not
great
though
really
grainy
on
the
finish
most
of
the
flavors
are
considerably
weaker
than
the
aftertaste
i
drank
the
whole
thing
so
it
is
palatable
but
it
is
not
much
beyond
that
not
a
repeat
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
small
short
lived
off
white
head
aroma
and
taste
of
sweet
lightly
toasted
caramel
malt
yeast
some
fruity
notes
light
hops
palate
is
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
and
kind
of
watery
mouth
feel
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
and
some
light
fruity
notes
ending
is
bit
of
funky
nuttiness
overall
needs
more
backbone
and
flavor
seems
a
bit
weak
for
an
amber
just
an
ok
brew
overall
not
an
outstanding
beer
i
have
had
better
amber
ales
o
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
food
but
it
is
not
all
that
memorable
on
its
own
its
one
of
those
beers
that
pretty
much
does
all
that
you
would
expect
it
to
and
nothing
more
o
theres
not
much
to
this
beer
but
it
did
go
well
with
my
burger
and
fries
nothing
exciting
but
its
an
easy
drinker
o
easy
drinking
ale
pretty
average
nothing
bad
nothing
memorable
caramel
malt
flavor
light
a
bit
watery
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
underwhelming
and
simply
not
that
good
light
to
medium
body
very
flat
carbonation
lingering
sweet
malty
finish
dissapointing
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
i
actually
thought
it
was
a
little
overcarbonated
it
was
fine
to
have
with
dinner
i
guess
but
i
might
as
well
have
gone
with
having
water
the
taste
was
just
not
there
for
me
not
recommended
o
this
is
what
i
call
a
wash
it
down
beer
its
got
simple
flavors
and
equates
to
not
much
more
than
a
beverage
to
go
with
dinner
2
5
d
this
is
a
notquitemediocre
brew
ill
pass
on
it
from
now
on
breckenridge
brewery
avalanche
ale
i
have
fond
memories
of
good
times
at
the
original
breckenridge
brewery
in
breckenridge
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
an
avalanche
ale
and
needing
to
bring
a
six
pack
over
to
a
friends
for
dinner
was
my
opportunity
to
revisit
is
brew
the
mahogany
brown
body
is
almost
clear
with
very
light
carbonation
the
offwhite
head
is
thin
and
the
aroma
is
very
faint
almost
not
there
the
color
makes
you
expect
a
heavy
malty
roasty
brew
but
the
flavor
and
feel
is
actually
quite
light
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
and
a
light
bitterness
throughout
no
flower
y
hops
here
this
is
very
much
an
english
style
ale
quite
drinkable
but
my
taste
in
beer
has
moved
on
to
brews
with
more
complexity
d
drinkable
but
lacks
depth
somewhere
in
the
middle
not
that
interesting
but
certainly
decent
a
decent
amber
a
malty
sturdy
nose
malty
sweet
red
pour
with
a
respectable
offwhite
head
quick
grainy
mild
finish
medium
body
nothing
remarkable
in
an
otherworldly
sense
yet
a
repeatably
satisfying
drink
6pack
no
worries
its
just
above
average
but
good
vibes
overall
decent
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
could
be
fuller
o
falls
short
overall
needs
more
distinguishing
flavors
and
better
head
retention
drinkable
but
would
have
to
be
at
the
right
price
to
buy
again
o
will
not
buy
again
i
love
my
local
brews
but
this
one
kicked
me
in
the
nuts
i
hope
they
can
do
better
with
others
i
might
try
d
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
its
drinkable
but
i
think
id
pass
in
this
one
o
this
was
a
tad
disappointing
but
ive
had
worse
overall
just
an
average
drinkable
beer
here
folks
easy
drinking
but
lacking
flavor
and
character
i
wonder
if
it
loses
some
of
its
flavor
on
the
way
over
here
from
colorado
alright
nothing
offensive
i
said
although
blah
is
in
my
beerworld
offensive
but
rather
than
get
all
huffy
about
it
ill
just
not
buy
the
stuff
again
easy
over
n
out
o
just
an
ok
amber
ale
nothing
special
or
something
i
will
remember
o
pretty
drinkable
amber
ale
average
appearance
and
taste
mouthfeel
wasnt
that
great
the
beer
is
amber
hued
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
brings
some
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
fruit
the
flavor
is
alright
slightly
sweet
malty
and
generally
uneventful
a
light
hop
presence
emerges
in
the
finish
with
a
soft
bitterness
possibly
the
most
exciting
aspect
of
the
beer
the
body
is
relatively
thin
with
minimal
alcohol
presence
the
flavor
dissipates
quickly
after
each
swallow
overall
this
beer
is
unoffensive
but
really
bland
ill
finish
my
pint
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
this
again
o
its
very
easy
to
drink
as
there
are
no
offense
flavors
however
there
is
little
to
no
character
either
though
not
bad
nothing
stands
out
making
this
on
a
c
or
so
decent
beer
picked
up
the
beer
during
a
aps
conference
in
denver
my
junior
year
of
undergrad
its
been
sitting
in
my
various
fridges
ever
since
other
beers
have
survived
this
amount
of
cellaring
quite
well
around
2
5
years
and
i
checked
my
review
with
others
to
see
similar
observations
therefore
this
review
stands
and
this
beer
is
in
general
a
subpar
lackluster
example
of
an
amber
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
of
fruit
and
toast
with
a
hint
of
toffee
its
flavor
has
caramel
dough
and
hoppy
fruit
notes
with
a
touch
of
root
beer
in
the
finish
it
has
a
mediumlight
mouthfeel
with
very
mild
carbonation
breckenridge
avalanche
ale
is
a
good
beer
dry
and
refreshing
recommended
i
like
breckenridge
as
i
think
they
do
have
some
flavorful
and
creative
offerings
unfortunately
their
flagship
beer
leaves
much
to
be
desired
overall
this
is
the
first
breckenridge
that
did
not
build
my
hopes
up
with
the
look
and
smell
only
to
dissapoint
me
in
the
taste
nothing
spectacular
but
also
fairly
drinkable
o
i
was
actually
surprised
by
this
beer
i
usually
dont
care
for
amber
ales
but
this
one
was
mild
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
was
ok
drank
fine
last
night
but
not
very
complex
and
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
poured
a
bright
translucent
amber
little
head
lacing
to
match
most
enjoyable
part
of
this
beer
is
the
smell
sweet
and
nutty
aromas
hints
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
unfortunately
didnt
impress
as
much
the
overall
flavor
seemed
a
bit
thin
the
hop
profile
didnt
come
through
much
in
the
aroma
and
didnt
exist
much
in
the
taste
less
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
i
expected
more
noticeable
sweetness
but
it
just
didnt
come
through
the
mouthfeel
was
relatively
thin
but
the
lightness
accompanied
by
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
gave
an
overall
sessionable
feel
the
flagship
beer
and
last
one
to
try
in
the
mixed
pack
pours
a
cloudy
orange
nice
little
head
to
it
bit
of
a
macro
beer
smell
to
it
uh
oh
taste
is
medium
bodied
surprisingly
good
mouthfeel
well
balanced
with
a
nice
bit
of
hops
to
it
super
drinkable
and
really
hits
the
spot
i
know
this
may
be
the
generic
mass
produced
micro
for
this
brewery
but
for
some
reason
i
find
it
delicious
and
really
refreshing
yummy
and
no
frills
give
it
a
try
notes
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
about
ten
years
ago
then
i
had
it
again
a
couple
years
later
this
time
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
this
one
at
new
england
wine
and
spirits
in
newburyport
its
as
tasty
as
it
ever
was
which
is
very
good
cheers
o
overall
a
sweet
toasted
flavor
with
moderate
regards
but
falls
a
bit
short
in
other
aspects
appearance
aroma
which
shouldnt
be
a
problem
for
the
average
drinker
dont
know
if
i
could
recommend
this
by
the
six
pack
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
though
nothing
exciting
an
averageish
brew
an
auburn
color
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
weak
with
just
a
small
amount
of
lightly
burnt
caramel
malt
no
hops
are
present
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
light
with
the
faintly
burnt
malt
carrying
over
from
the
nose
some
grassy
hops
but
only
slightly
ice
cold
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
overall
this
tastes
like
a
borderline
adjunct
d
somewhat
average
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
special
copper
in
color
light
tan
head
thats
gone
right
quick
and
in
a
hurry
little
dots
of
lacing
pretty
average
nose
is
biscuity
with
some
floral
hops
hmmmm
not
to
complex
but
strong
taste
is
bitter
and
a
bit
sharp
around
the
edges
has
some
medicinal
properties
in
the
background
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
which
makes
it
even
less
refined
slightly
above
average
got
this
in
a
sampler
12
pack
at
8
to
9
dollars
i
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
worth
a
try
though
put
it
all
together
and
you
get
a
slightly
better
then
middle
of
the
road
amber
yawn
tastes
much
the
same
bread
a
hint
of
roastiness
and
a
minimal
hop
snap
at
the
finish
straightforward
and
sturdy
and
a
solid
session
amber
ale
overall
better
than
average
i
dont
know
how
this
only
has
a
c
rating
at
the
time
of
this
posting
its
really
good
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
beer
also
had
a
cult
following
like
another
co
amber
but
i
was
very
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
taste
here
balance
is
achieved
by
minimizing
at
least
it
does
a
good
impression
of
the
beatles
help
i
need
some
body
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
pours
a
translucent
amber
with
a
quarter
inch
loose
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
sizzles
and
dissipates
into
a
sudsy
skim
nose
is
not
much
to
write
home
about
cereal
grains
and
a
trace
of
noble
hops
if
i
had
to
guess
taste
follows
nose
and
culminates
in
a
slightly
bready
aftertaste
theres
also
a
faint
citrus
character
present
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
effervescence
and
a
crisp
finish
a
pretty
lackluster
american
amber
closer
to
a
macro
in
taste
and
smell
im
going
to
need
to
wash
this
one
down
with
a
cascazilla
d
i
wouldnt
send
this
beer
back
but
i
wouldnt
order
another
there
is
nothing
technically
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
is
so
boring
i
understand
that
the
style
should
be
expected
to
be
well
balanced
but
there
is
almost
nothing
to
balance
here
the
beer
is
not
just
middle
of
the
road
which
would
be
understandable
its
like
it
never
really
bothers
to
leave
the
driveway
ill
finish
what
i
have
but
dont
need
anymore
drinkability
pretty
good
drinkability
id
attribute
this
to
the
good
aftertaste
i
wasnt
able
to
drink
this
from
a
glass
so
i
cant
comment
on
the
color
or
head
basically
this
was
a
good
flavored
beer
that
had
a
flat
characteristic
it
is
actually
not
bad
even
though
it
reminds
me
slightly
of
two
beers
i
dont
like
bells
oarsman
and
four
horsemans
irish
red
both
of
those
are
very
flat
yet
their
sour
profiles
render
them
almost
undrinkable
to
me
the
nice
flavor
of
this
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
would
i
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
though
probably
not
db
a
malty
fruity
amber
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
it
is
fruitier
than
any
amber
i
have
had
but
it
would
work
better
if
it
didnt
feel
diluted
the
liquid
is
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
you
can
smell
lots
of
toasted
malt
butter
there
is
a
slightly
herbal
presence
in
the
background
the
taste
consists
of
toasted
bread
there
is
a
tangy
bite
on
the
sides
of
the
mouth
and
a
hint
of
lemon
the
beer
is
light
and
has
sharp
carbonation
this
is
an
average
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
would
probably
get
bored
smells
of
lightly
sweet
and
bready
malts
with
hints
of
nuttiness
and
leafy
hops
flavors
lean
more
nutty
and
tangy
hop
presence
is
modest
and
tealike
although
its
a
keg
and
thus
i
must
assume
its
fresh
there
are
hints
of
an
odd
staleness
almost
like
some
crackers
sitting
in
a
box
a
couple
of
weeks
past
the
best
by
date
not
something
id
revisit
notes
way
too
faint
watery
and
lacking
has
some
vague
english
flavors
but
not
done
well
a
touch
of
carameltoffee
but
the
taste
has
too
much
toasted
grain
similar
problem
with
the
hops
having
a
slightly
tea
flavor
but
more
bitter
slightly
grassy
flavors
this
an
easy
drinker
sweet
but
subtle
flavors
has
a
good
finish
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
05820b
sampled
on
february
19
2011
the
amber
colored
pour
was
attractive
but
little
head
despite
an
aggressive
pour
grainy
aroma
with
sweet
malts
and
bread
mingled
in
the
body
is
rather
light
the
taste
tends
to
come
across
as
more
grainy
than
anything
else
it
went
down
very
fast
though
it
has
a
lot
of
off
flavors
and
isnt
very
clean
it
tastes
like
too
much
sugar
was
added
to
this
brew
serving
type
bottle
apparently
this
is
the
special
of
the
month
which
is
honestly
the
only
reason
that
i
had
it
this
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
remnant
of
white
foam
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
tad
bit
sweet
there
may
have
been
a
twinge
of
adjunct
but
the
aromatics
were
so
faint
i
really
couldnt
pick
up
much
this
beer
has
a
pretty
distinct
malt
characteristic
with
a
gritty
earthy
bitterness
to
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
that
while
not
making
it
unpleasant
doesnt
make
it
anything
worth
going
back
for
more
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
and
bitter
but
not
too
much
to
take
away
from
the
beer
itself
i
had
no
problem
drinking
the
beer
but
im
glad
that
it
was
on
special
because
to
me
that
meant
it
was
closer
to
being
priced
right
drink
is
not
great
either
its
light
and
crisp
but
the
bad
flavors
just
dont
go
well
mostly
grainy
some
residual
sugars
very
low
hop
level
still
there
is
an
offness
to
the
flavor
which
i
believe
is
primarily
from
the
aroma
the
body
is
decent
but
cant
make
up
for
the
rest
drinkability
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
i
thought
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
made
it
easy
to
drink
it
is
straight
forward
and
subtle
which
i
find
appealing
i
would
drink
again
a
beer
that
promised
more
than
it
could
deliver
ontap
at
the
breck
in
colorado
during
a
ski
trip
into
a
pint
glass
as
well
as
out
of
cans
before
poured
yellowishorange
with
14
inch
white
head
that
limped
into
a
ring
smelt
of
slight
hints
of
roast
and
sweet
maltiness
taste
begins
sweet
and
bready
and
dissipates
with
a
hint
of
sour
fruit
and
moss
merging
towards
the
end
less
hops
than
a
elephant
mouthfeel
was
light
overall
a
fairly
disappointing
amber
that
could
use
less
sweetness
and
more
malty
bite
or
hops
drinkability
is
average
something
i
could
drink
all
day
but
probably
would
pick
up
something
else
instead
d
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again
and
really
not
much
more
flavor
than
a
typical
amber
lager
but
it
was
still
cool
to
try
in
a
can
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
would
have
been
a
decent
beer
but
the
soapy
taste
ruined
it
for
me
everything
but
the
taste
is
decent
will
not
buy
this
again
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
something
to
seek
either
certainly
plenty
of
more
interesting
ambers
on
the
shelves
this
was
a
decent
amber
ale
i
thought
that
the
hop
profile
could
have
been
cleaned
up
a
little
but
this
was
mostly
flavorful
and
the
crisp
yet
still
mostly
smooth
body
helped
out
the
drinkibility
of
their
beers
this
was
probably
a
good
one
for
breckenridge
to
put
in
cans
d
average
brew
not
too
memorable
fairly
drinkable
medium
body
very
doughy
but
easy
to
drink
good
session
beer
but
overall
not
terribly
impressive
d
see
taste
d
eh
a
decent
standard
drinker
id
say
about
par
with
sa
bl
drinkability
different
taste
is
fairly
intriguing
id
be
willing
to
drink
more
just
to
figure
this
one
out
pours
a
moderate
amber
color
a
bit
thick
with
an
off
whore
head
nose
is
pretty
plain
with
some
doughy
caramel
and
a
bit
of
nuts
nutty
in
the
taste
with
mild
toast
and
that
is
about
it
medium
body
and
somewhat
chewy
drinks
okay
nothing
wrong
just
not
super
flavorful
d
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
not
the
most
in
the
fuller
flavor
department
but
a
decent
amber
ale
nevertheless
the
abv
on
this
one
makes
it
a
easy
drinker
but
i
would
want
to
go
with
a
fuller
flavor
amber
personally
notes
in
most
respects
its
a
pretty
typical
amber
ale
the
acidic
finish
is
a
bit
weird
but
its
not
strong
enough
to
be
truly
unpleasant
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
but
theres
better
ambers
out
there
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
brew
not
outstanding
but
nowhere
near
horrible
i
like
it
ok
and
would
give
it
a
second
try
if
someone
offered
beats
any
macro
by
a
long
shot
in
my
opinion
d
drinks
like
marzen
so
not
too
bad
flavors
are
simple
d
high
drinkability
easily
sessionable
vigorous
pour
produces
2
fingers
of
head
which
quickly
fades
it
appears
a
light
golden
color
i
smell
bready
malts
and
sone
caramel
tastes
are
malts
some
hops
at
the
end
kinda
flavorless
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
has
hardly
any
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
because
it
is
so
light
mediocre
overall
not
a
very
good
amber
ale
i
feel
no
need
to
have
this
again
just
ok
not
bad
out
of
the
can
drinks
ok
3
not
bad
but
i
liked
the
others
in
the
sampler
better
especially
the
ipa
not
a
bad
brewery
tho
id
like
to
sample
more
of
their
offerings
im
a
big
fan
of
fine
canned
beers
and
this
one
delivers
i
should
note
a
quick
caveat
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
because
it
reminds
me
of
being
in
breckenridge
otherwise
it
tastes
strong
of
the
amber
goes
down
cool
crisp
and
refreshing
and
you
can
thoroughly
enjoy
another
one
it
may
be
true
that
i
would
drop
this
to
a
slightly
lower
rating
if
not
for
some
biases
i
hold
in
its
favor
but
whatever
they
are
there
and
this
is
my
review
its
not
the
greatest
of
all
things
but
it
treats
me
right
d
a
solid
amber
i
wish
it
was
a
little
hoppier
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
liked
it
but
really
nothing
id
repurchase
d
not
very
good
at
all
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
this
is
the
second
one
i
have
tried
over
the
course
of
three
days
and
both
have
been
unpleasant
i
wont
be
drinking
another
one
of
these
in
regards
to
style
i
dont
think
it
fits
chalk
it
up
as
sheer
genius
or
clumbsy
brilliance
breckenridge
has
done
something
great
with
this
one
out
of
a
can
that
i
have
overlooked
for
a
year
in
my
local
shop
pours
a
tastilizingly
huge
head
spilling
over
on
the
garage
floor
smells
rather
mundane
not
much
to
speak
of
here
moving
along
to
the
taste
nuts
and
berrys
and
herbs
piney
hoppy
hits
the
mouth
with
a
zesty
bite
with
lots
of
creamy
overtones
finishes
like
something
from
belgium
very
easy
do
drink
goes
down
too
good
this
beer
is
hard
to
put
in
a
pigeon
hole
i
think
it
is
all
over
the
board
from
its
irish
ale
like
carbonation
and
bite
but
rather
close
to
a
northwest
pale
ale
in
character
all
i
know
is
i
love
it
and
at
14
bucks
for
a
12
pack
of
cans
you
just
cant
beat
it
nicely
done
would
i
buy
more
of
it
can
i
try
some
of
the
lucky
u
ipa
first
and
then
decide
unfortunately
breckenridge
cost
does
not
match
their
quality
wont
be
having
this
again
anytime
soon
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
hops
taste
is
good
malts
with
some
notes
of
caramel
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
good
quality
brew
drinkability
a
medium
drink
not
a
favorite
for
the
cellar
but
decent
notes
it
looks
like
im
in
the
minority
on
this
beer
ive
had
it
bottled
before
and
i
can
tell
you
that
it
was
better
out
of
the
can
i
especially
like
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
sessionable
and
packs
some
good
flavor
for
being
a
lower
abv
drinkability
is
moderate
the
beer
is
relatively
sessionable
however
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
boring
which
doesnt
encourage
me
to
keep
picking
it
back
up
d
though
it
will
not
be
mistaken
for
a
worldclass
brew
this
one
is
easy
to
suck
down
since
it
is
thin
and
flavorful
without
the
sticky
finish
it
would
score
a
halftick
higher
this
beer
has
a
c
man
there
are
some
haters
in
the
room
this
is
far
closer
to
an
amber
lager
or
irish
red
in
terms
of
taste
and
feel
but
im
not
going
to
knock
a
good
beer
for
deviating
from
a
typical
american
red
sure
its
smooth
and
drinkable
but
theres
still
substance
the
malt
have
an
interesting
sourdough
tang
with
light
caramel
and
bread
crust
notes
theres
a
slight
hint
of
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
roast
grain
and
cocoa
i
call
this
good
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
order
a
pitcher
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
yuengling
lager
would
if
it
were
made
by
a
craft
brewer
medium
bodied
that
is
decently
enjoyable
although
not
one
i
would
buy
unless
faced
with
a
ballpark
scenario
in
which
this
is
the
only
craft
option
this
might
make
a
good
introduction
to
amber
ales
for
people
interested
in
trying
the
style
pours
a
decent
midredcopper
color
but
with
just
a
touch
of
initial
head
and
no
lacing
very
sweet
malty
scent
very
lagerish
with
a
slightly
skunky
aroma
underneath
decent
flavor
mostly
a
sweet
almost
too
sweet
malt
flavor
with
just
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
goes
down
fairly
smooth
but
without
a
lot
of
interesting
flavor
profiles
decent
beer
but
doesnt
do
much
for
me
md
mildmoderate
carbonation
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
wasnt
very
pleasant
it
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
in
a
good
way
i
would
be
more
upset
if
i
bought
an
entire
6pk
and
not
as
a
single
d
i
dont
know
if
i
would
ever
have
again
but
it
certainly
is
worth
a
try
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
an
ok
tannish
head
gone
quickly
with
little
stick
smell
is
mostly
modest
toasted
malt
taste
is
upper
end
tipofthetongue
sweet
malts
with
a
slightly
metallic
midtongue
bitterness
to
finish
smooth
brew
the
light
taste
lasts
for
a
bit
nothing
too
extraordinary
but
worth
the
try
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
way
too
sweet
sugary
even
for
the
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
a
tiny
bit
of
white
head
good
lacing
smells
is
slightly
floral
with
biscuity
malt
taste
is
a
little
underwhelming
there
is
a
malt
presence
but
nothing
spectacular
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
hops
to
a
lesser
extent
this
is
kind
of
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
its
very
mild
and
doesnt
have
anything
disagreeable
in
it
certainly
more
drinkable
than
miller
lite
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
12
ouncer
though
i
wouldnt
get
a
sixpack
of
this
pumpkin
orange
with
blonde
highlights
and
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
blobs
of
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
toasted
grain
caramel
and
light
fruity
hops
make
up
the
smell
sweet
and
caramely
with
a
mineraly
flavor
and
herbal
hop
notes
in
the
finish
medium
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
decent
session
beer
overall
thanks
to
josh
for
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
mild
for
me
but
it
is
good
for
the
style
it
is
a
nice
solid
beer
d
not
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
too
much
malts
and
not
enough
hops
a
poor
beer
overall
i
am
surprised
this
ale
is
not
rated
higher
it
is
certainly
not
the
most
complex
ales
available
but
it
does
have
good
flavor
and
drinkability
for
an
amber
style
ale
it
is
very
good
perhaps
the
ale
tastes
better
when
packaged
in
a
can
i
noticed
there
were
no
other
reviews
of
this
product
from
a
can
d
as
average
is
this
brew
is
compared
to
others
in
the
style
its
still
a
beer
i
would
take
any
day
over
a
macro
i
found
myself
emptying
my
pint
glass
surprisingly
fast
while
drinking
it
and
i
could
see
this
as
being
an
excellent
summer
brew
looks
good
being
poured
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
color
is
an
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
quickly
dissipating
head
leaving
a
small
amount
of
lacing
first
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
earthy
hops
very
nice
with
a
big
fried
bacon
cheese
burger
mediumlight
body
with
a
nice
light
malty
finsih
overall
the
pitcher
went
fast
and
was
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
its
really
not
the
most
impressive
beer
but
its
worth
a
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
to
full
bodied
good
level
of
carbonation
not
a
chore
to
put
one
of
these
down
but
not
at
all
exciting
drinkability
something
struck
me
as
all
too
familiar
once
i
started
this
beer
its
just
a
little
too
generic
i
am
a
fan
of
the
american
amberred
ales
but
this
one
wasnt
that
surprising
and
worthy
for
me
to
keep
this
beer
stacked
in
my
fridge
i
would
recommand
it
to
my
friend
who
is
just
starting
to
spread
his
experimenting
good
beers
wings
well
i
dont
wish
to
slam
this
beer
entirely
cheers
the
feel
is
light
and
not
drinkable
total
drain
pour
wont
be
buying
this
again
d
itd
be
easier
to
drink
if
it
tasted
better
but
that
seems
obvious
d
decent
drinkability
abv
doesnt
appear
to
be
high
not
filling
flavors
are
not
overbearing
no
unpleasant
attributes
not
extremely
impressed
with
this
one
copper
colored
with
little
or
no
head
smell
is
malty
to
start
followed
by
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
follows
suit
bready
malts
with
some
hop
bitterness
but
also
some
strange
metallic
taste
to
it
too
mf
is
light
bodied
and
thin
good
for
drinking
a
few
of
these
but
not
great
for
enjoyment
not
bad
but
there
are
definitely
better
ambers
out
there
12
oz

a
hazy
orangered
color
with
a
small
frothy
offwhite
head
fair
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
pale
malts
nuts
a
touch
of
yeast
and
light
earthy

flavor
is
caramel
apples
yeast
a
hint
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
dry
and
bitter
pretty
drinkable
beer
kinda
dry
for
the
style
and
finishes
with
a
classic
english
sweetness
nothing
too
special
but
a
pretty
trustworthy
amber
that
is
sort
of
a
brown
but
not
really
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
but
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
if
youre
an
amber
ale
fan
like
me
youll
be
better
served
looking
elsewhere
if
you
like
the
idea
of
caramel
and
pine
buy
it
body
was
light
feel
was
kind
of
dry
err
yea
it
looked
good
but
the
buck
stopped
there
i
was
thirsty
so
i
drank
it
feel
and
drinkability
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
enhanced
so
by
the
low
level
of
carbonation
this
one
finishes
very
clean
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
this
easily
being
a
session
beer
i
wouldnt
go
in
search
of
this
beer
but
id
not
be
afraid
to
buy
it
either
ill
definitely
be
trying
others
before
coming
back
to
this
one
not
bad
but
not
great
just
average
drinkability
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
very
sessionable
i
do
like
the
mix
of
malt
and
hops
this
one
is
better
on
draft
d
decent
flavor
coupled
with
great
drinkability
means
score
for
this
beer
perfect
for
a
sessioner
that
tastes
good
but
one
you
dont
have
to
think
about
d
for
me
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
it
goes
down
easily
enough
a
little
more
complexity
would
be
nice
overall
nothing
crazy
here
fresh
and
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
sorry
breckenridge
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
ddrinkable
though
i
would
probably
go
elsewhere
most
times
this
one
pours
a
pretty
orange
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
smells
of
malt
bread
and
a
hint
of
fruit
tastes
initially
of
malt
some
fruit
alongs
the
lines
of
a
belgian
as
i
worked
my
way
through
it
the
flavor
seemed
to
become
less
interesting
than
at
the
first
no
flaws
just
no
complexity
that
you
expect
when
it
warms
carbonation
is
solid
and
this
is
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
for
an
amber
d
good
taste
medium
to
light
body
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
without
feeling
overly
full
overall
a
pretty
tasty
amber
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
beachshore
ten

is
getting
shut

have

so
many

i
am

about

this
is
much
more
suitable
for
a
day
on
the
beach
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
that
was
pretty
easy
drinking
a
decent
amber
ale
all
around
and
worth
a
go
breckenridge
avalanche
ale
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
on
the
malty
end
the
flavor
is
malty
and
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
its
easy
enough
to
drink
decent
session
beer
drinkability
this
one
was
a
bit
boring
for
me
personally
so
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
may
be
difficult
if
looking
for
a
flavorful
session
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
moderate
head
mostly
diminishing
reminds
me
of
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
but
maybe
one
thats
sat
around
awhile
biscuit
caramel
malts
with
decent
balance
just
not
very
enlightening
i
would
gladly
partake
of
if
offered
but
do
not
think
i
will
purchase
again
best
i
can
say
is
kind
of
like
a
sam
adams
bastard
twin
not
up
to
snuff
of
the
real
thing
nice
dark
brown
color
almost
copper
very
faint
malty
smell
i
have
had
a
few
beers
from
breckenridge
and
have
been
impressed
but
this
aint
it
can
taste
malt
but
the
texture
is
way
too
thin
and
so
are
the
flavors
this
beer
might
be
better
with
higher
carbonation
drinkable
yes
but
not
sure
you
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
drinkability
quite
sessionable
i
may
have
found
my
new
stock
beer
for
the
summer
appears
a
clear
amber
with
a
light
khaki
head
forms
thick
initially
leaving
behind
thin
lacing
around
my
new
dollar
tree
tulip
chalice
aromatics
are
a
bit
timid
with
watery
caramel
and
some
mineral
tones
peeking
through
as
well
not
much
hop
action
going
on
in
the
nose
or
flavor
and
the
aroma
just
smells
like
some
grains
watered
down
with
minimal
caramel
notes
flavor
is
pretty
expected
of
breckenridge
flagship
amber
comes
watery
and
not
real
assertive
or
cohesive
with
the
flavors
minimal
toasted
nut
with
caramel
and
a
tart
grain
husk
offness
not
much
hop
flavor
with
minimal
bitterness
from
the
lack
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
watery
feel
with
a
sharp
bitey
mouthfeel
mainly
from
the
carbonation
level
drinkability
is
pretty
weak
not
a
beer
i
would
welcome
back
in
the
future
id
rather
drink
fresh
goose
island
honkers
for
6
50
a
sixer
or
better
yet
some
cans
of
yuengling
amber
lager
at
least
you
dont
expect
much
from
the
canned
regional
brewery
overall
avoid
at
all
cost
makes
me
appreciate
my
local
brewerys
amber
ale
that
much
more
native
amber
by
coop
ale
works
bought
this
on
a
whim
because
i
was
feeling
something
light
this
definitely
was
nothing
special
but
good
for
having
a
few
over
dinner
and
a
game
pours
gold
with
not
much
head
smells
almost
like
stale
beer
taste
was
slightly
metalic
but
more
complex
than
other
ambers
ive
tried
low
abv
makes
this
a
decent
session
beer
like
i
said
before
nothing
great
but
not
a
bad
offering
in
my
opinion
boring
really
this
is
one
to
avoid
its
not
impressive
past
the
cool
label
maybe
its
better
at
the
brewery
had
this
at
the
flying
saucer
houston
poured
in
a
pint
glass
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
light
head
very
weak
aroma
just
some
malts
and
very
faint
caramel
very
watery
tasting
with
not
enough
hops
profile
some
very
light
grassiness
in
the
end
but
not
enough
very
weak
and
boring
blaaaahhhh
was
very
dissapointing
will
not
try
again
pours
a
thick
head
which
dissipates
very
slowly
a
pretty
pleasant
smell
although
not
a
lot
of
hints
of
much
of
anything
the
taste
falls
rather
flat
i
dont
get
much
flavor
out
of
it
easy
to
drink
but
without
much
taste
why
would
youi
just
purchased
one
of
these
from
a
store
that
allows
mix
and
match
so
hopefully
maybe
it
is
just
this
one
beer
that
doesnt
pass
inspection
the
smell
is
okay
with
hints
of
malt
and
grain
present
no
real
hop
odor
is
present
pours
a
medium
red
color
with
a
halffinger
foam
taste
follows
suit
a
solid
malt
backbone
but
no
hops
to
speak
off
solid
and
decent
tasting
mouthfeel
is
alright
but
nothing
spectacular
its
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
ale
if
its
your
only
option
not
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
but
a
decent
enough
offering
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
simple
beer
nothing
to
special
about
it
that
and
i
dont
plan
on
buying
any
of
this
i
am
still
trying
to
find
some
decent
red
ales
crossing
my
fingers
for
summit
horizon
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
it
was
a
good
beer
not
memorable
poured
red
not
an
impressive
smell
it
seems
to
be
a
beer
that
is
not
an
impressive
amber
which
happens
to
be
my
favorite
beer
selection
besides
wheat
beers
it
is
one
that
i
will
not
kick
out
of
bed
but
not
a
go
to
beer
by
any
means
d
drinkable
but
nothing
special
finally
this
is
the
last
beer
from
breckenridges
sampler
the
agave
wheat
and
vanilla
porter
were
drain
pours
while
this
beer
along
with
their
oatmeal
stout
have
at
least
redeemed
themselves
some
its
got
a
nice
light
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
over
a
dark
gold
body
i
guess
that
qualifies
as
amber
with
some
lighter
soft
edges
little
visible
carbonation
though
you
can
feel
it
the
scent
is
unremarkable
grain
and
sweet
grass
with
maybe
a
little
orchard
fruit
and
light
citrus
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
with
a
lingering
citrus
finish
thats
not
quite
dry
theres
a
medium
to
maybe
a
medium
full
feel
to
it
possibly
from
the
carbonation
not
a
great
ale
and
yet
not
a
bad
ale
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
as
they
dont
date
the
bottles
or
cases
and
i
can
get
known
fresh
beers
from
other
breweries
so
there
somewhat
of
a
thick
feeling
on
the
palate
goes
down
smooth
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
small
offwhite
head
sits
on
top
of
an
amber
body
no
carbonation
whatsoever
the
smell
is
of
malts
no
hops
are
noticeable
this
could
probably
pass
as
an
irish
red
ale
the
taste
is
also
mainly
malts
little
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
dont
drink
and
review
as
for
if
i
would
buy
this
again
not
likely
it
wasnt
a
bad
drink
just
average
in
most
areas
d
a
decent
session
option
but
not
much
else
to
recommend
it
nice
but
average
and
a
bit
watery
at
times
fairly
typical
amber
not
bad
not
great
a
very
fine
textured
but
minimal
amount
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
rather
dull
mouthfeel
semidry
with
a
notsoclean
finish
not
a
bad
tasting
or
smelling
brew
but
the
mouthfeel
certainly
leaves
something
to
be
desired
an
average
selection
at
best
pours
a
typical
amber
color
with
a
little
head
that
does
not
leave
much
lace
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
malty
with
a
little
hop
presence
not
much
to
the
drinkabllity
i
see
it
as
just
an
average
runofthemill
amber
ale
it
is
nothing
special
and
does
not
impress
me
very
much
d
not
a
bad
session
beer
at
all
its
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
to
it
worth
trying
sometime
poured

a

with

highlights
the
offwhite
cap
provides
ample

as
it
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
cap
that
retains
the
duration
the
nose
is
subtly
sweet
with
caramel
some
light
floral
and
soft
metallic
notes
like
dirty
waterim
not
impressed
a
moderate
amount
of
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
bread
crust
makes
up
the
best
this
has
to
offer
metallic
notes
work
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
sweet
base
and
creates
a
conflict
with
my
pallet
that
i
just
cant
get
passed
some
light
fruitiness
and
earthy
hoppiness
is
an
effort
at
complexity
and
flavor
sadly
this
falls
well
short
of
a
complete
finish
and
really
it
was
off
to
a
poor
start
the
mouthfeel
is
even
less
impressive
thin
and
boring
i
cant
say
i
would
never
drink
this
again
but
there
is
no
reason
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
this

the
taste
is
also
very
malty
almost
like
amber
lme
syrup
there
is
some
hops
present
but
not
enough
to
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
have
prefered
as
was
the
carbonation
overall
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
unbalanced
sweetness
of
the
beer
but
it
does
go
down
like
water
due
to
the
consistancy
good
beer
if
you
like
sweet
amber
ales
avalanche
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
maltiness
which
fades
quickly
to
a
hop
finish
the
hops
are
fairly
smooth
and
not
overbearing
it
is
almost
like
a
pale
ale
meets
an
amber
drinkability
this
is
a
different
beer
than
i
expected
and
takes
a
while
to
get
used
to
nice
work
for
a
truly
unique
beer

flavor
is
matly
up

mellowed
into

the
crisp

it

only
a
little
residual

the

good

the

the
beer
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
just
a
down
the

good
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wont
seek
out
or
necessarily
order
if
i
see
it
on
tap
but
one
that
i
will
pick
up
from
time

malty
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
dry
hop
finish
a
pretty
light
bodied
beer
a
tad
watery
but
not
altogether
bad
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
leaves
a
sort
of
sweetness
on
your
palette
i
thought
this
actually
tasted
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
not
very
impressive
overall
not
a
bad
little
ale
not
the
best
thing
but
a
solid
effort
none
the
less
i
would
not
have
an
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
in
the
future
cannot
wait
to
get
even
more
quality
offerings
in
around
here
from
breckenridge
they
are
a
damn
fine
brewer
following
this
up
with
a
vanilla
porter
hit
the
spot
pours
a
body
that
is
golden
brown
in
color
and
medium
sized
head
that
is
fairly
diminishing
has
a
complex
aroma
hops
and
fruit
taste
is
slightly
dry
semisweet
but
with
not
much
aftertaste
not
too
complex
a
palate
this
beer
is
a
hazy
amberred
in
color
that
has
a
creamy
thin
tan
head
after
a
medium
pour
smell
is
of
rust
really
not
very
good
taste
is
better
biscuity
malt
a
hint
of
woodyness
and
tartness
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
decent
good
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
ive
had
much
better
amber
ales
before
though
i
would
drink
it
again
but
would
not
seek
it
out
specifically
overall
i
continue
to
be
disappointed
by
breckenridges
brews
with
the
notable
exception
of
471
small
batch
one
of
these
days
im
sure
ill
find
another
one
that
measures
up
but
id
stay
away
from
this
one
this
ale
pours
a
dark
amber
with
very
little
head
not
very
attractive
there
is
no
nose
detectable
to
me
this
is
matched
by
a
very
light
flavor
disappointing
for
an
amber
ale
that
should
have
more
robust
flavor
the
malt
is
simple
and
not
at
all
complex
and
the
flavor
dissipates
completely
at
the
finish
drinkable
if
youre
thirsty
but
not
if
youre
craving
some
good
beer
flavor
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
terribly
average
beer
in
many
ways
its
just
very
very
uninteresting
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
special
enough
to
rate
much
above
average
mid
body
with
good
carbonation
could
do
session
drinks
well
i
like
this
beer
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
average
i
dont
mind
it
but
probably
will
not
seek
it
out
if
at
a
social
gathering
this
was
what
was
available
to
drink
id
be
alright
with
it
i
just
wont
be
filling
the
fridge
with
it
anytime
soon
pours
a
deep
amberish
copper
with
a
small
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
to
a
ring
fairly
quickly
leaving
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
generic
grains
and
sweet
bready
malts
the
taste
was
big
on
the
sweet
malts
with
a
sourish
almost
metallic
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
with
the
lingering
sourness
being
a
little
offputting
this
is
a
fair
amber
but
not
one
that
i
would
buy
again
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
though
its
billed
as
an
amber
ale
its
somewhat
darker
in
color
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
whole
lot
in
terms
of
flavor
but
the
biscuity
malt
tones
are
quite
good
and
theyre
not
too
strongly
masked
by
hoppy
bitterness
as
with
the
other
breckenridge
brews
that
ive
had
im
relatively
pleased
with
this
one
at
least
try
it
if
you
havent
at
its
very
worst
its
not
any
worse
than
average
this
is
just
a
simple
easy
drinking
not
bad
not
great
malty
beer
from
a
great
little
brewery
the
body
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
big
red
undertones
the
head
is
pretty
minimal
and
turns
to
a
slightly
noticeable
film
the
nose
is
almost
all
malt
big
hits
of
vienna
and
crystal
malts
are
dominant
definitely
not
a
bad
thing
but
not
necessarily
my
favorite
very
faint
hops
found
anywhere
the
taste
is
smooth
malty
and
slightly
metallic
on
the
swallow
there
is
almost
a
touch
or
rye
spiciness
on
the
swallow
the
bittering
hops
come
through
a
bit
and
add
a
layer
of
coarse
dryness
body
is
moderately
full
but
easy
drinking
in
my
opinion
this
is
nothing
more
than
an
average
amber
ale
the
is
hardly
memorable
it
is
however
one
of
those
beers
that
if
enjoyed
in
the
right
setting
and
environment
i
e
college
ski
trip
can
make
for
a
few
smiles
and
happy
times
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
it
does
not
dominate
or
kill
any
parts
of
the
pallet
so
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
or
great
in
a
style
tasting
avalanche
pours
deep
amber
with
golden
tones
that
leaves
quickly
dissipating
foam
smell
is
light
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruity
notes
and
little
hops
taste
is
subdued
with
nice
toasted
grain
quite
smooth
and
somewhat
light
with
a
slight
hop
tinge
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
sticky
sweet
coat
and
is
medium
bodied
at
right
around
5
alcohol
by
volume
avalanche
makes
a
great
session
beer
ive
had
much
worse
but
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
dits
alright
i
have
certainly
had
worse
a
little
boring
but
not
at
all
offensive
overall
its
kinda
middleoftheroad
in
both
the
good
sense
doesnt
get
old
and
bad
nothing
memorable
about
it
either
if
a
barngrill
place
had
it
on
tap
id
get
it
if
only
because
despite
the
above
its
still
better
than
the
macros
but
this
is
more
than
likely
my
last
standalone
bottle
maybe
they
have
some
others
more
distinguishable
but
this
aint
makin
my
rotation
looks
like
a
nice
amber
ale
clear
with
a
tan
head
unfortunately
not
much
is
coming
through
the
nose
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
that
crystal
malt
delivers
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
taste
is
quite
pleasant
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
its
a
classic
amber
ale
flavorful
without
being
assertive
and
its
got
a
decent
american
hop
backbone
to
support
it
mothfeel
is
good
enough
for
the
style
and
drinkability
is
pretty
darned
good
count
me
in
for
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
cool
fall
day
overall
what
a
dud
this
1
has
barely
an
aroma
or
flavor
avoid
md
sharp
feel
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
feel
and
kinda
rough
as
well
not
the
most
desirable
beer
in
brecks
inventory
but
ok
to
drink
d
certainly
a
decent
session
ale
in
many
respects
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
at
least
try
it
d
generally
more
flavorful
than
the
average
ale
but
everything
else
about
this
brew
is
pretty
mainstream
not
incredibly
smooth
but
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
give
it
a
try
if
your
in
the
mood
i
guess
ill
give
breckenridge
another
try
in
the
future
since
this
bottle
might
not
be
indicative
of
what
they
are
capable
of
the
breckenridge
brews
have
always
flow
under
my
radar
for
some
reason
so
i
should
get
on
the
ball
and
fix
that
a
dark
brown
brew
with
big
ruby
streaks
throughout
is
topped
of
by
a
light
tan
onefinger
head
which
fades
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
some
inconsistent
streaks
of
lacing
behind
smells
of
malts
some
subtle
sweetness
and
maybe
some
spice
tastes
of
tea
and
a
bit
of
hops
pretty
drinkable
and
not
bad
tasting
but
nothing
to
write
home
to
mom
about
this
is
a
one
night
stand
that
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
you
probably
wont
be
giving
it
a
booty
call
anytime
soon
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
than
what
i
got
which
was
a
very
lessthan
ordinary
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
as
the
name
would
imply
creating
a
very
small
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
cap
and
left
little
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
taste
is
much
the
same
sweet
bready
malts
light
caramel
infusion
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
background
good
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
an
average
brew
of
this
style
a
notch
or
two
above
average
at
the
very
least
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
poured
a
cloudy
red
colour
similar
to
watered
down
tea
with
a
single
finger
thick
sand
coloured
head
that
stayed
in
place
for
all
of
60
seconds
smell
was
dominated
by
sweet
malts
with
what
i
would
pereive
to
be
biscuity
if
that
makes
sense
flavor
too
was
almost
all
malt
with
a
bizarre
sourness
to
it
unsure
if
the
sourness
is
meant
to
be
here
or
not
it
wasnt
offensive
or
anything
but
it
certainly
did
not
augment
the
taste
in
any
way
everything
was
pretty
average
with
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
forgettable
mouthfeel
is
light
malty
bitter
crisp
a
nice
choice
for
sessioning
overall
a
tasty
beer
at
a
very
tasty
price
d
i
did
not
find
anything
i
disliked
about
this
beer
per
se
but
there
was
nothing
that
i
really
liked
about
it
either
a
good
drinking
beer
i
suppose
poured
a
thick
frothy
white
head
smells
like
a
macro
color
is
more
pale
than
amber
taste
is
not
bad
not
good
not
enough
hops
for
my
liking
in
an
amber
even
though
the
hops
are
negligible
the
malt
taste
is
not
dominant
either
this
is
a
slight
step
above
a
macro
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
wont
buy
again
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
composed
of
mild
malts
and
possibly
some
english
hops
a
nice
mild
ale
flavor
good
malty
base
to
it
the
medium
body
is
paired
with
some
fizzy
carbonation
a
drinkable
brew
somewhere
between
a
red
mild
and
brown
ale
good
session
beer
not
all
that
bad
brew
perfect
for
pizza
or
just
a
session
brew
wish
it
had
a
little
more
oomph
but
still
solid
and
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
golden
amber
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
a
bit
sour
perhaps
perhaps
not
i
detect
citrucy
hops
and
a
nice
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
natural
and
clean
but
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
normal
for
this
style
beer
and
it
is
certainly
good
enough
to
drink
every
once
in
a
while
i
used
to
visit
this
brewpub
when
i
lived
in
memphis
so
it
was
good
to
have
a
beer
from
them
again
overall
a
very
solid
amber
i
really
enjoy
breckenridge
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
d
this
is
an
okay
amber
not
the
best
but
certainly
drinkable
d
just
a
tad
too
cloying
with
the
cookielike
aftertaste
but
overall
its
not
a
bad
amber
ale
flavor
is
semisweet
with
toasty
bready
malt
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
comes
through
as
somewhat
acidic
medium
body
with
sharp
carbonation
this
beer
does
not
have
much
depth
to
it
and
it
becomes
pretty
boring
after
a
few
tastes
not
impressed
with
this
one
drinkability
im
not
a
huge
amber
fan
but
this
one
although
a
bit
thin
has
better
balance
than
previous
ambers
i
have
tried
verdict
pretty
weak
stuff
it
almost
seems
like
a
fake
craftbrew
i
keep
looking
for
a
hidden
anheuserbusch
logo
somewhere
bland
flat
and
rather
soulless
breckenridge
avalanche
is
forgettable
in
every
sense
d
not
bad
but
not
likely
that
i
have
another
overall
descent
beer
that
is
definately
worth
a
go
round
nothing
extra
special
but
good
pours
a
orangeish
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweeter
malt
with
caramel
hints
in
the
taste
sweet
maltiness
with
roasty
and
caramel
hints
a
smooth
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
semi
dry
caramel
like
aftertaste
nice
roasty
and
caramel
malt
easy
to
drink
and
non
offensive
good
and
basic
md
this
is
a
more
basic
example
of
this
style
i
do
however
like
it
and
find
it
to
be
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
good
solid
beer
nothing
too
fancy
but
still
good
drinkability
is
pretty
low
for
me
that
metallic
aftertaste
as
was
just
too
much
i
could
barely
finish
the
first
glass
let
alone
the
whole
bomber
picked
up
from
the
newly
installed
singles
shelf
at
greens
the
beer
poured
out
hazy
amber
in
color
and
had
a
small
thin
head
the
smell
was
very
mild
and
predominantly
that
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
followed
the
smell
as
a
mostly
malty
offering
with
a
vague
fruitiness
and
a
floral
hop
presence
somewhat
watery
and
seltzer
feel
rounded
out
the
experience
instead
of
an
avalanche
this
was
more
like
the
snow
sliding
off
the
roof
when
you
slammed
the
door
too
hard
d
this
ones
a
little
odd
hop
profile
caught
me
off
guard
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
weak
not
too
bad
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
more
drinkability
i
wouldnt
ask
for
another
of
these
would
be
a
good
session
beer
tasty
enough
to
drink
large
quantities
low
enough
abv
to
be
sessionable
not
particularly
memorable
as
far
as
seeking
it
out
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
i
will
likely
buy
a
sixer
of
this
one
d
dont
expect
extreme
or
unique
here
but
its
good
a
solid
and
very
sessionable
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
theres
many
better
examples
out
there
worth
a
shot
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
carbonation
is
good
drinkability
is
definitely
above
average
this
would
actually
be
pretty
nice
on
a
hot
day
its
worth
a
try
appearance
was
deep
amber
about
two
steps
away
from
brown
thin
head
quickly
settled
back
into
beer
smelled
toasty
vanallia
and
caramel
no
real
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
tasted
very
close
to
how
it
smelled
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
bitterness
was
just
enought
to
balance
it
out
body
was
light
overall
pretty
good
because
of
its
light
body
and
no
flavor
profile
being
overbearing
this
would
make
a
good
thirst
quencher
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
beer
then
the
wheats
and
blondes
so
obviously
the
drinkablility
is
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
d
meh
this
amber
has
some
body
to
it
almost
heavy
with
a
pretty
good
feel
interestingly
it
could
trick
you
into
thinking
youre
having
a
draft
i
could
dirnk
another
but
i
wouldnt
session
it
much
past
that
smell
is
of
malt
somewhat
toasty
and
sweet
flavor
is
nice
but
nothing
outstanding
good
clean
finish
no
aftertaste
d
obviously
a
brew
made
to
session
and
appeal
to
a
wide
variety
of
drinkers
including
the
macro
crowd
and
they
pull
if
off
very
well
nothing
offensive
and
a
easy
drinking
sessionable
amber
ale
sláinte
pretty
good
beer
the
first
thing
i
notice
in
the
taste
is
well
not
very
much
just
thin
very
and
i
mean
very
slight
maltiness
and
what
there
even
is
of
it
just
add
a
metallic
taste
to
what
seems
a
watery
concoction
in
the
first
place
a
hint
of
sour
apple
comes
through
towards
the
end
that
is
i
guess
for
the
lack
of
a
better
word
a
clean
finish
but
that
finish
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
boring
to
begin
with
ill
be
passing
on
this
one
in
the
future
all
in
all
ok
but
not
one
ill
choose
again
i
wouldnt
pay
for
another
one
and
id
only
drink
a
few
if
it
were
free
this
dark
ale
pours
a
very
nice
dark
golden
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
aroma
is
spicy
and
hoppy
with
some
malt
hints
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
bite
and
plenty
of
malty
smoothness
this
is
a
delicious
and
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
a
cold
night
drinkability
this
is
a
drinkable
in
a
sense
owing
to
its
low
alcohol
and
rather
muted
flavor
profile
however
nothing
much
of
interest
here
tastes
more
like
a
british
pale
but
not
a
very
good
one
maybe
i
just
dont
like
american
ambers
dnot
much
d
if
offered
i
would
drink
it
without
a
qualm
as
it
is
a
safe
drink
but
not
memorable
or
one
to
mention
in
conversation
d
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
its
not
all
bad
its
just
boring
and
a
bit
funky
this
seemed
way
offbalance
given
to
me
as
a
gift
i
wouldnt
normally
purchase
an
amber
of
my
own
volition
this
particular
beer
is
average
at
best
but
is
closer
to
below
average
the
head
is
surprisingly
dense
and
creamy
after
the
pour
however
it
goes
down
hill
an
ideal
pizza
beer
because
it
would
not
overpower
any
aspect
of
the
foods
flavor
but
it
would
not
enhance
it
either
nothing
special
here
recommendation
to
avoid
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
ok
but
its
a
little
on
the
watery
side
pretty
basic
amber
flavors
and
hop
presence
are
both
pretty
mild
certainly
sessionable
but
overall
nothing
really
sets
it
apart
the
fun
stopped
there
for
me
though
while
its
possible
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
batch
and
there
was
a
spot
on
the
label
to
denote
bottling
date
it
wasnt
marked
for
whatever
reason
the
smell
was
subtle
the
taste
a
bit
bland
its
a
nice
thick
ale
but
it
just
doesnt
hold
up
to
more
flavorful
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
drinkability
you
know
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
just
a
less
sweet
acme
pale
ale
there
i
said
and
you
know
what
it
felt
good
its
good
to
be
honest
a
nice
deep
red
amber
in
appearance
but
after
that
nothing
seems
to
really
stand
out
the
taste
is
fine
nice
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
is
balanced
well
with
hop
bitterness
but
no
real
memorable
flavors
to
speak
of
put
this
in
the
illneverturnonedownbutneverreachforwillingly
category
o
kinda
disapointed
good
for
food
i
guess
since
ambers
are
more
of
a
subdued
style
i
cant
knock
it
too
bad
but
ive
had
better
a
nice
gentle
interpretation
of
a
nice
gentle
style
ambers
arent
supposed
to
set
the
world
on
fire
and
this
one
doesnt
but
it
is
a
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
with
no
off
flavors
expect
maybe
a
little
too
much
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
any
time
or
enjoy
the
rest
of
my
life
without
having
one
ever
again
very
forgetable
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
very
little
head
that
fades
fast
and
leavs
no
lacing
smell
is
that
of
a
beer
nothing
worth
noting
tastes
is
slightly
malty
and
watery
i
dont
know
if
i
can
pick
out
a
beer
brewed
with
adjuncts
but
i
would
say
this
was
one
if
asked
i
suppose
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
one
that
i
wouldnt
ask
for
again
it
tastes
very
similar
to
shiner
98
but
not
as
good
and
shiner
98
wasnt
that
great
either
tastes
iron
dryyish
but
nice
malty
finish
hops
are
present
but
quite
in
line
with
the
intensity
of
the
malt
woody
dry
with
minimal
pine
and
orange
hop
flavor
light
caramel
is
strung
a
bit
thinner
than
id
like
for
the
style
fruity
sweet
in
the
aftertaste
leaves
everything
nice
md
body
and
moderate
carbonation
very
middle
of
the
road
beer
avalanche
ale
is
an
interesting
beer
in
that
it
seems
to
fall
halfway
between
an
english
pale
ale
and
an
american
amber
ale
the
slightly
sulphury
mineralish
english
yeast
is
just
so
blatant
that
i
cant
think
of
anything
but
english
ale
and
yet
it
does
have
a
bit
more
crystal
malt
to
it
like
an
american
version
its
got
a
just
slightly
hazy
deepamberorange
body
and
creamy
antiquedwhite
head
the
retention
and
lacing
are
good
the
aroma
is
nice
particularly
if
you
enjoy
the
yeast
character
and
theres
a
bit
of
subtly
sweetish
caramel
malt
and
grassy
and
leafy
hops
present
as
well
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
with
malt
and
yeast
character
stepping
forward
and
hops
and
bitterness
following
theres
a
mild
fruitiness
to
it
like
apricot
apples
and
pears
but
the
yeast
also
leaves
it
almost
a
touch
bloody
or
ironlike
i
find
it
reminiscent
of
batemans
xxx
its
interesting
enough
to
keep
your
interest
through
more
than
one
and
it
might
make
a
good
session
ale
nicely
done
decidedly
and
confusingly
macrolagerlike
and
hugely
disappointing
sometimes
it
pays
off
blindly
grabbing
a
single
bottle
to
try
sometimes
you
wish
you
could
get
your
money
back
avoid
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
good
lace
lots
of
big
malts
aromas
mixed
with
a
bit
of
biscuitbready
smells
again
lots
of
malt
flavors
followed
by
the
same
biscuity
flavors
leaving
a
decent
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
malts
do
tend
to
disappear
a
bit
too
quickly
though
all
in
all
a
decent
flagship
beer
for
breckenridge
nothing
special
though
another
disappointing
brew
from
breckenridge
and
probably
the
last
one
i
try
from
them
eric
its
light
bodied
not
all
that
complex
very
drinkable
not
revolutionary
but
quaffable
this
brew
poured
a
clear
amber
liquid
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
shrunk
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
a
notes
of
floral
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
sweet
malts
with
some
grainy
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
the
hops
that
are
there
help
it
finish
dry
a
drinkable
ale
nothing
special
the
bottle
has
numbers
for
the
months
and
weeks
bottled
but
is
not
notched
as
it
should
be
pours
a
copperamber
with
a
quickly
diminishing
offwhite
head
aroma
is
mostly
of
euro
vegetalearthyfloral
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
toffee
taste
is
mostly
drycrispastringent
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
this
reminds
me
of
a
domestic
attempt
at
a
marzen
but
without
the
malt
sweetness
basically
something
rather
tame
that
you
could
have
several
of
would
be
a
good
intro
to
craft
beer
for
meatheads
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
nothing
special
as
far
as
amber
ales
go
medium
to
light
body
i
thought
there
was
a
little
too
much
carbonation
although
that
problem
disappeared
as
the
beer
warmed
smooth
and
drinkable
but
honestly
the
metal
was
too
much
for
me
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
second
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
got
a
pint
and
a
half
bottle
that
i
split
with
a
buddy
in
two
pint
glasses
i
liked
the
amber
color
and
the
head
stayed
around
for
a
while
the
beer
smelt
sweet
with
a
big
dose
of
citrus
i
enjoyed
the
distinct
orange
flavor
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
all
around
beers
drinkability
great
this
is
a
smooth
everyday
kind
of
beer
and
despite
the
metallic
taste
it
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
on
a
hot
summer
day
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
medium
amber
forming
a
14
inch
white
head
that
quickly
faded
leaving
light
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
flavor
is
heavy
sweet
malt
with
a
slight
amount
of
hops
towards
the
end
the
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
a
medium
mouthfeel
being
a
little
thicker
than
expected
from
this
style
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
consume
a
great
beer
to
have
in
between
the
heavier
porters
and
stouts
amber
light
i
couldnt
see
myself
buying
this
again
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
but
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
very
distinguishing
qualities
d
this
is
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
it
tastes
good
enough
where
you
can
just
put
them
down
like
water
drinkability
easy
to
drink
because
of
its
lack
of
any
significant
flavor
i
just
cant
get
over
the
cheap
smell
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
one
nothing
too
bad
but
it
seems
like
there
are
some
other
ales
like
this
one
that
have
a
little
more
to
them
pours
a
copper
amber
color
into
glass
looks
just
as
expected
not
much
of
a
smell
maybe
the
smell
of
barley
coming
through
because
the
taste
is
pretty
dominant
of
a
abrley
malt
leaves
kind
of
an
estra
tangy
bittersweet
aftertaste
which
is
the
only
thing
i
didnt
really
care
about
the
beer
otherwise
the
taste
is
maybe
a
little
bland
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
there
except
for
the
aftertaste
another
reviewer
said
it
reminded
him
of
vomit
aftertaste
and
i
agree
not
that
its
a
nasty
naste
just
the
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
very
similiar
worth
a
try
but
nothing
special
here
enjoy
this
amber
ale
pours
a
clear
light
copper
into
my
mug
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
a
spotty
skim
the
beer
has
a
moderatehigh
sweet
malty
aroma
sweet
like
dark
fruits
and
there
are
hints
of
spicyness
i
cannot
much
in
the
way
of
hop
aroma
no
surprises
in
the
taste
a
rather
sweet
ale
caramel
and
maybe
some
toasted
grains
the
perceived
hop
bitterness
is
low
to
maybe
moderatelow
a
little
more
balance
would
have
been
appreciated
a
slight
metallic
taste
is
also
evident
mainly
at
warmer
temperatures
a
low
hop
flavor
is
also
there
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
has
medium
carbonation
for
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
it
does
finish
with
a
surprising
little
bit
of
dryness
which
was
nice
the
beer
almost
seems
like
a
halfhearted
attempt
at
an
oktoberfest
type
ale
overall
the
beer
was
ok
there
was
nothing
that
really
wowed
me
and
nothing
that
really
turned
me
off
terribly
i
wouldnt
say
no
if
someone
bought
me
one
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
nicely
designed
label
the
smell
is
strong
on
barley
the
taste
is
mild
yet
distinctive
it
has
a
striking
resemblance
to
vomit
not
completely
in
a
bad
way
giving
it
a
bittersweet
tang
i
suspect
this
flavor
comes
from
the
meld
of
sweet
malt
taste
and
the
acidic
taste
of
the
inconspicuous
hops
middleweight
amber
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
want
to
try
something
other
than
the
macros
and
i
like
it
better
than
fat
tire
but
not
as
much
as
90schilling
well
pours
with
little
to
no
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
taste
very
malty
and
kind
of
like
some
honey
with
some
bitterness
the
mouth
feel
is
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
but
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
waste
the
money
on
it
its
nothing
more
than
average
very
biscuity
tasting
malt
lightly
fruity
finished
with
light
herbal
hops
but
its
the
malt
that
you
taste
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
lightly
sweet
mouth
this
is
decent
i
like
the
biscuity
character
but
something
doesnt
mesh
well
here
above
average
but
little
else
the
beer
pours
dark
and
has
a
dense
vigorous
head
very
smooth
and
sweet
tasting
without
much
malt
bitterness
delicious
the
smell
is
somewhat
metallic
though
thankfully
it
doesnt
extend
to
the
flavor
in
any
way
it
tastes
almost
like
oranges
im
surprise
by
how
well
this
beer
tastes
as
ive
tried
other
breckenridge
beers
with
little
success
very
enjoyable
beer
a
definite
get
pours
a
medium
amber
topped
by
a
rather
solid
cream
colored
head
head
showed
decent
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
note
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
has
a
nice
mellow
caramel
flavor
backed
by
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
a
soft
malt
backbone
finishes
just
a
little
dry
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
inviting
and
perfectly
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
will
not
hesitate
to
have
this
one
again
its
a
very
solid
session
type
beer
that
also
pairs
well
with
food
colorado
has
these
american
reds
down
very
akin
to
new
belgiums
fat
tire
avalanche
has
a
smooth
start
with
a
sweet
middle
and
a
slighty
bitter
but
crisp
finish
in
a
blind
taste
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
differentiate
the
two
it
goes
down
easy
and
balances
my
pulled
pork
sammich
quite
well
d
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
it
hint
all
the
right
notes
for
me
and
although
it
wasnt
outstanding
i
would
gladly
return
to
it
overall
a
fairly
disappointing
amber
that
could
use
less
sweetness
and
more
malty
bite
or
hops
had
a
two2
ounce
glass
of
this
draft
as
part
of
a
6
beer
sampler
at
the
brewery
amber
color
with
thin
white
head
and
little
lacing
finish
was
somewhat
metallic
not
the
best
of
the
lot
and
in
fact
probably
the
one
i
enjoyed
the
least
of
the
six
you
could
drink
this
one
any
place
any
time
and
it
will
not
get
in
the
way
i
guess
there
is
a
place
for
beers
like
this
but
ill
stick
with
something
cheaper
a
light
orange
color
with
some
darker
tones
and
a
small
white
head
forms
that
quickly
dissolves
a
mild
malty
scent
with
a
bit
citrusy
hop
aroma
a
very
very
very
mild
malt
flavor
the
hops
are
not
evident
in
the
taste
in
the
mouth
it
is
medium
bodied
very
smooth
going
down
a
bit
of
tingle
from
the
carbonation
a
good
session
beer
the
mild
flavor
makes
easy
to
want
more
but
nothing
to
totally
be
excited
about
fairly
robust
copper
orange
with
a
fairly
shortlived
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
fizziness
imbibing
reminded
reminded
me
of
opening
an
old
cellar
though
not
necessarily
ni
a
bad
way
it
had
an
aged
resiny
and
nutty
taste
that
released
a
mind
of
pungent
and
tart
vapor
that
really
settled
onto
the
back
sides
of
my
tongue
that
was
kind
of
the
highlight
but
the
taste
did
not
blow
me
out
of
the
water
overall
there
was
also
a
slightly
sticky
lingering
aftertaste
i
could
have
done
without
drinks
okay
flavors
just
dont
pull
together
like
the
summer
ale
does
would
do
in
a
pinch
slighlty
better
than
the
last
one
i
tried
this
is
an
ok
amber
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
overall
another
in
a
long
line
of
bland
american
ambers
taste
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
for
an
amber
ale
but
drinkable
and
should
work
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
or
to
wash
down
some
barbecue
certainly
an
easy
drinker
but
if
you
want
any
flavor
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
i
will
never
drink
this
again
it
tastes
pretty
watery
and
leaves
no
remnance
of
any
beereven
lager
d
high
rather
good
and
well
balanced
a
great
mealtime
beer
amber
from
the
smell
i
can
already
tell
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
dreadful
experience
exclusive
malt
tones
of
toffee
caramel
pale
and
caramel
malts
not
much
hop
presense
in
the
aroma
and
into
the
flavor
tastes
of
sweet
malts
and
the
atributes
of
pale
and
caramel
malts
fairly
simple
and
one
dimensional
but
this
is
drinkable
drinkability
drank
a
lot
of
these
at
the
espn
club
downtown
denver
so
must
be
good
crystal
clear
burnt
orange
smell
is
a
bit
metallic
light
caramel
malts
the
aroma
isnt
all
that
special
tastes
consist
of
a
fairly
messy
malt
profile
and
no
bitterness
that
has
any
real
character
toffeeish
offflavors
are
more
than
abundant
mediumbodied
and
somewhat
slick
going
down
certainly
not
something
id
waste
my
money
buying
again
this
beer
is
better
than
most
of
the
stuff
in
a
can
but
not
a
good
representative
of
the
brewery
if
i
am
the
mood
for
an
amber
i
will
reach
for
a
few
other
six
packs
before
choosing
this
one
again
this
is
my
first
beer
from
the
breckenridge
brewery
this
is
not
the
best
example
of
this
style
worth
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
it
was
okay
light
brown
in
appearence
basic
smells
of
grains
the
taste
was
by
my
own
opinion
a
little
watered
down
decent
drinkability
as
witnessed
by
the
45
i
drank
during
my
vacation
i
was
really
trying
to
give
the
beer
a
chance
im
not
sure
if
my
review
has
anything
to
do
with
the
3
2
alcohol
content
but
it
could
have
affected
my
judgement
on
the
whole
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
qualify
as
mediocre
at
best
better
than
a
macro
for
sure
but
there
are
many
many
similarly
priced
ambers
from
this
country
and
others
that
are
more
impressive
low
body
could
use
some
more
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
a
pretty
straightforward
amber
my
only
real
problem
is
the
plasticness
in
the
initial
quaff
this
is
an
ok
ale
that
is
nothing
more
than
that
just
a
competent
average
ale
here
try
it
if
you
see
it
but
dont
travel
for
it
this
brew
is
deep
red
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
lacing
the
sparce
to
begin
with
and
fades
into
nothing
quite
fast
the
aroma
is
a
faint
sweetness
and
nothing
else
the
taste
is
mildy
sweet
and
clean
i
actually
thought
this
was
a
lager
while
i
was
drinking
it
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
way
too
much
carbonation
the
taste
might
have
been
better
and
more
pronounced
if
the
carbonation
wasnt
so
irritating
overall
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
enjoyable
i
do
not
think
i
will
try
this
beer
again
for
a
good
long
while
opinion
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
evening
so
i
figured
that
this
one
would
go
over
better
than
this
i
am
pretty
disappointed
obviously
this
beer
is
just
too
light
and
the
only
flavors
that
i
get
with
any
significance
are
bordering
on
flaws
i
have
their
pale
ale
in
the
fridge
also
so
i
hope
it
makes
a
better
showing
than
this
one
after
tearing
into
a
breckenridge
breweing
companys
variety
pack
this
weekend
i
beleive
this
beer
to
be
the
best
of
the
selection
though
no
standout
characteristics
it
is
well
brewed
clean
and
easily
palatable
aromas
have
a
medium
malt
profile
with
bready
toasty
yeasty
malty
and
caramel
looks
amber
with
adequate
retention
and
lacing
flavors
are
medium
malty
with
hop
bittering
to
balance
mild
spices
and
hop
flavor
for
accents
finishes
clean
and
cool
quite
a
nice
beer
it
will
be
easily
forgotten
however
because
many
preceive
this
to
be
a
lackluster
beer
style
too
bad
its
a
good
beer
not
a
bad
amber
ale
pours
out
to
a
slightly
hazy
red
auburn
color
with
a
short
lived
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
thin
layer
of
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
medium
level
of
carbonation
some
notes
of
lacing
aromas
were
light
some
sweet
malt
herbs
and
spices
taste
was
quaffable
flavors
of
malt
sourness
minor
hops
and
some
cooked
veggies
and
herbs
mouthfeel
was
decent
and
appropriate
for
the
style
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
touch
of
viscosity
overall
drinkability
is
decent
could
be
a
good
session
beer
worth
a
try
poured
a
crisp
copper
with
lively
carbonation
some
orchard
fruit
in
the
aroma
and
carried
up
front
in
the
flavor
a
touch
of
grain
husk
punches
through
toward
the
end
but
withdraws
and
the
light
fruityness
picks
up
again
for
the
finish
moderate
hops
bittering
is
constant
but
plays
secondfiddle
pleasant
but
unremarkable
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
patchy
coating
over
top
small
tendrils
of
lace
cling
to
the
glass
nose
is
very
grainy
almost
spicey
from
the
grain
that
is
really
all
i
get
from
the
nose
flavor
is
more
subdued
on
the
grain
than
the
nose
but
it
is
still
the
dominant
flavor
there
is
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
that
takes
the
edge
off
the
graineyness
flavors
dont
hang
on
into
the
finish
much
at
all
other
than
the
nice
toasted
grain
rather
tasty
beer
feel
is
very
solid
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
as
with
many
nothing
makes
it
stand
out
but
there
are
no
overriding
flaws
that
would
keep
me
away
from
it
this
one
would
is
nice
for
watching
some
ncaa
football
on
an
early
fall
evening
could
easily
session
it
all
day
fragrant
smooth
and
tasty
breckenridge
avalanche
ale
will
find
its
way
back
into
my
beer
glass
real
soon
this
is
a
really
good
beer
not
a
lot
of
hit
you
in
the
face
flavors
but
enough
interesting
going
on
to
make
me
want
more
i
recommend
it
a
medium
bodied
brew
a
basic
quaffer
for
any
season

but
in
the
end
just
not
to
exciting
or
one
i
would
seek
out
if
this
beer
had
more
backbone
to
its
body
it
would
only
make
it
that
much
better
alittle
richness
wouldnot
hurt
thisone
mouthfeel
could
be
fuller
drinkable
but
rather
boring
avalanche
is
amberorange
in
color
with
a
averagesized
off
white
head
the
aroma
consists
of
medicore
amber
malt
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
thrown
into
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
has
a
decent
malt
profile
not
quite
rich
enough
and
a
little
grainy
citrussy
hops
make
an
appearance
midway
through
a
sip
and
give
this
beer
some
needed
character
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
just
tasty
enough
to
be
good
but
still
seems
a
little
raw
around
the
edges
at
4
99
a
sixer
this
is
a
good
find
overall
impression
not
the
most
exciting
beer
kind
of
a
generic
amber
watered
down
fat
tire
comes
to
mind
not
bad
but
there
are
many
many
other
beers
from
colorado
i
would
prefer
aroma
consists
of
faint
herbs
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
midrange
as
far
as
carbonation
initial
taste
is
a
mild
maltiness
barely
present
hops
and
a
vegetable
taste
redolent
of
green
beans
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
but
it
is
subsumed
by
a
bland
unpleasant
taste
and
combined
with
its
lack
of
flavor
makes
this
beer
a
pass

the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
some
mild
hopping
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
light
yet
sweet
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
amber
ale
it
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
a
fine
sessions
ale
i
had
hopes
for
this
beer
but
i
just
couldnt
get
past
the
granny
smith
apple
vastly
unimpressive
pours
out
a
sexy
amber
color
with
a
white
heaadskie
on
top
nice
smooth
body
makes
for
good
drinkability
factor
nice
balance
tastes
good
but
not
great
an
above
average
amber
ale
worth
checking
out
me
thinks
because
anyone
could
easily
put
down
these
one
after
another
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
not
with
many
other
similar
better
brews
available
for
nearly
the
same
price
this
ones
just
too
weak
and
blah
light
to
medium
bodied

for
this

with
a

a
good
session
beer
for
enjoying
football
on
the
tube
a
nice
looking
reddish
amber
brew
that
has
a
white
head
that
didnt
stay
very
long
and
it
leaves
no
lace
on
my
glass
there
is
a
nice
hop
aroma
and
a
fruity
ester
in
there
too
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
follows
up
with
a
sweet
malty
nirvana
before
the
hops
hit
your
tongue
definitely
a
easy
drinking
ale
i
will
be
revisiting
this
beer
in
the
near
future

a

the

the

about

flavors
start
out
simple
brown

maltiness
fairly
straightforward
but
with
a
little
orangey
tang
that
magnifies
to
a
decent
hoppiness
and
balance
toward
the
back
of
the
profile
seems
to
sweeten
on
further
sips
and
takes
on
a
vegetal
funkiness
a
little
ordinary
and
the

spend
more
than
a
1
25
on
this
one
it
is
not
going
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
quite
an
awesome
brew
especially
for
being
3

abw
this
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
between
the
rich
biscuit
toast
and
malt
body
always
brings
a
smile
to
my
face
its
true
to
style
and
surpasses
many
of
the
better
ambers
out
there
very
easy
to
drink
stuff
and
its
only
5
996er
here
in
estes
park
and
loveland
recommended
this
could
easily
become
an
everyday
beer
for
me
taste
jibes
completely
with
the
nose
showing
big
malted
grain
character
roasted
and
toasted
and
very
dry
bitter
hops
mild
carbonation
and
smooth
medium
body
a
great
unique
amber
ale
that
i
found
highly
drinkable
i
bought
this
as
a
single
that
was
being
sold
because
of
the
rest
of
its
sixpack
mates
had
been
killed
in
a
dropping
accident
very
light
carmel
color
tiny
white
head
moderate
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
some
burnt
carmel
malts
faint
bitter
hops
with
a
big
grassy
malt
backing
somewhat
of
a
forgettable
beer
i
took
a
sip
it
tasted
like
mixed
vegetables
peas
and
corn
it
had
an
okay
body
i
guess
but
it
really
seriously
tasted
like
sweet
peas
and
thats
just
weird
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
pours
a
deep
amber
hue
with
a
light
foamy
head
roasted
malt
aroma
not
much
else
very
foamy
body
contains
a
palate
of
roaste
malt
light
toffee
and
a
faint
amount
of
hops
that
builds
on
the
finish
overall
flavor
is
nice
but
the
body
is
way
too
carbonated
of
course
i
had
this
in
a
crappy
airport
bar
so
maybe
its
usually
better
avalanche
ale
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
the
head
is
small
offwhite
and
dense
but
fizzy
clear
clear
darkish
orangeamber
liquid
a
touch
rosy
if
im
sane
sweet
fruity
nutty
aroma
is
just
a
little
bit
sour
tangy
nutty
front
the
middle
gets
sweetish
fruity
its
a
little
thinnish
and
theres
a
strange
tangy
sour
touch
almost
like
a
rye
or
buckwheat
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
touch
fruity
apples
nice
roasted
grains
this
is
ok
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
1
43
12
oz
pours
a
clear
amber
of
course
the
head
is
somewhat
worth
mentioning
hmmmm
overall
bland
beer
here
i
cant
get
much
of
an
aroma
at
all
just
a
bit
of
buttery
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
enjoyable
crisp
with
bland
malty
notes
comprising
the
flavor
there
isnt
much
hop
presence
to
speak
of
im
a
bit
disappointed
they
should
use
the
name
avalanche
for
a
more
throaty
beer
instead
of
this
hyundai
beer
the
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
amber
with
a
white
head
that
is
compact
but
lingering
the
aroma
is
pure
buttered
popcorn
super
strong
diacetyl
aroma
slight
caramel
behind
that
no
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
diacetyl
as
well
slick
butter
feel
on
the
tongue
and
the
finish
is
dry
butter
there
is
no
real
caramel
flavor
and
only
enough
hops
to
balance
the
butter
i
could
not
choke
down
much
of
this
a
tinge
of
red
on
a
smart
amber
body
the
head
is
white
and
creamy
but
shortlived
a
little
lace
from
the
slight
residual
nice
malty
nose
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
sweetly
malty
with
a
bit
of
hop
bittering
thin
and
light
body
seems
out
of
place
with
the
appearance
decent
drinkability
the
nose
kind
of
tricks
you
hey
mister
drink
me
im
all
malty
sweet
hehe
and
it
is
for
like
a
microsecond
until
the
puckering
hop
flavor
implodes
your
mouth
yet
it
did
hint
some
leafy
aromas
back
there
in
the
nose

i

thanks
to
bruiser81
for
providing
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
into
the
real
beer
game
not
having
it
since
then
i
think
i
can
appreciate
it
more
now
not
bad
at
all
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
a
limpid
deep
amber
to
burnished
copper
color
the
head
is
impressive
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
the
color
light

the
head
disappears

adequate
sheet
of

is
formed

those
who
like

too
excited
about
this

malts
and
not
much
else
going
on
lightly
sweet
malts
up
front
with
a
not
too
bitter
finish
nice
balance
but
i
get
the
impression
that
this
brewer
was
playing
it
safe
with
this
one
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
medium
amber
color
with
a
medium
foamy
beige
head
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
a
mild
and
malty
ale
it
has
a
lighter
body
and

nice

very
hoppy

smooth

somewhat
light

a
good
malty
sweetness
with
a
hop
tingle
slightly
present
feel
is
good
has
a
kind
of
sticky
sweet
coating
like
a
lollipop
and
is
smooth
and
closely
medium
bodied
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
really
hit
the
spot
and
fit
perfect
with
the
grilled
dinner
i
was
having
the
sticky
sweetness
the
way
it
clung
to
my
mouth
and
lingered
and
the
aroma
of
this
brew
all
reminded
me
of
melon
like
cantalope
or
honeydew
not
exactly
characteristics
that
i
enjoy
in
a
beer
while
it
made
for
an
interesting
aroma
it
didnt
transfer
well
to
the
palate
color
was
hazy
amber
foam
was
na
predominate
malt
smell
for
what
aroma
was
present
subtle
taste
was
on
the
light
side
with
an
even
slightly
malty
feel
as
the
bottle
suggests
gave
this
one
average
marks
with
the
caveat
that
this
is
against
other
craft
beers
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
mild
aroma
of
floral
hops
taste
is
dominated
by
a
sweet
maltiness
that
is
not
overpowering
and
also
has
notes
of
honey
and
caramel
its
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
it
would
be
nice
after
a
long
day
on
the
slopes
coppery
hue
the
head
never
developed
also
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
the
nose
was
slightly
toasty
malts
hints
of
sweetness
hoppiness
and
apple
notes
the
palate
is
tasty
but
a
little
thin
the
first
drop
that
hit
my
tongue
i
swear
was
water
but
it
definitely
went
up
from
there
very
tasty
sweet
maltiness
and
caramel
undertones
but
balanced
by
some
bitter
hops
this
was
a
good
amber
ale
id
drink
it
again

nice
dry
finish
only
downside
was
a
bit
of
a
watery
feel
still
very
good
nice
beer
before
and
with
dinner
i
liked
it
i
fell
in
love
with
this
brew
the
first
time
i
had
it
at
the
breckenridge
brewpub
in
denver
when
i
finally
found
it
back
here
in
dallas
i
was
ecstatic
the
deep
amber
color
is
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
you
can
defenietly
smell
the
caramel
flavors
right
away
the
rich
malts
and
the
perfect
body
to
it
make
it
taste
wonderful
it
feels
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
flows
down
the
throat
the
same
way
which
makes
it
very
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
a
beer
that
poured
out
a
copper
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
white
head
that
subsided
quickly
and
left
little
lace
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
a
slight
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
hops
caramel
malt
the
finish
was
a
bit
sweet
and
tangy
not
a
bad
beer
fo
the
summer
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
copper
colored
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
paperthin
layer
modest
lace
slight
carbonation
aroma
of
toasted
malts
and
some
slight
hops
taste
begins
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
slight
sting
of
carbonation
alcohol
notes
then
assert
themselves
followed
by
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
an
unexeceptional
but
decent
amber
ale
surprisingly
little
aroma
or
taste
but
an
allaround
refreshing
beer
especially
icecold
would
definitely
not
be
my
first
pick
of
the
breckenridge
line
but
miles
better
than
that
oatmeal
stuff
they
make
very
nice
dark
copper
appearance
nice
foamy
white
head
not
much
on
the
aroma
but
whats
there
is
rather
malty
almost
no
hops
smell
sweet
malty
taste
but
not
overly
so
very
drinkable
beer
cheers
light
amber
in
color
pours
a
relatively
thin
head
perfumy
bouquet
with
an
above
average
malty
body
an
aroma
of
malts
and
citrusy
hops
especially
nice
to
sip
when
watching
the
nhl
hockey
detroit
red
wings
smoke
the
defending
stanley
cup
champs
colorado
avalanche
light
copper
in
hue
w
a
thick
white
head
almost
lager
like
in
clarity
sweet
crystal
malt
with
slight
but
pleasant
butterscotch
and
biscuit
malt
notes
comprise
the
aroma
a
mild
perhaps
kent
goldings
hop
nose
is
present
as
well
the
body
is
moderate
for
an
amber
and
the
fairly
low
carbonation
allows
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
a
unique
and
almost
sharp
honey
like
sweetness
is
almost
balanced
by
the
hop
bitterness
but
sweet
malt
flavors
are
certainly
in
the
forefront
the
malt
character
and
overall
flavor
is
very
clean
yet
not
at
all
bland
making
for
a
drinkable
brew
pretty
tasty
there
are
better
ambers
out
there
but
there
are
also
way
more
insipid
ones
as
well
pours
a
thick
frothy
white
head
smells
like
a
macro
color
is
more
pale
than
amber
taste
is
not
bad
not
good
not
enough
hops
for
my
liking
in
an
amber
even
though
the
hops
are
negligible
the
malt
taste
is
not
dominant
either
this
is
a
slight
step
above
a
macro
pours
out
to
a
nice
amber
color
with
very
little
head
very
lightly
carbinated
with
a
slightly
sweet
malt
taste
very
light
on
hops
very
drinkable
but
not
very
recognizable
i
had
never
tried
breckenridge
prior
to
stumbling
upon
a
12pack
sampler
this
is
the
first
one
i
tried
their
website
lists
this
as
an
amber
tastes
a
lot
like
a
vienna
style
beer
a
little
too
thin
to
be
considered
an
octoberfest
but
similar
in
style
to
dos
equis
amber
but
much
much
more
flavorfull
im
curious
to
try
the
rest
of
their
products
which
i
will
do
over
the
next
week
or
two
feel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
refreshing
beer
thats
not
too
heavy
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
exactly
what
a
red
should
be
holy
shit
this
is
what
i
want
felicitas
to
be
when
it
grows
up
silky
mouthfeel
almost
creamy
perfect
hopmalt
balance
and
oh
that
amber
i
great
beer
smooth
hoppy
taste
with
a
great
amber
red
color
had
a
good
1
5
head
and
was
very
crisp
definitely
adding
this
on
to
the
top
favorites
list
imperial
red
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
earthy
aroma
and
very
earthy
taste
with
some
big
hop
flavors
nice
flavors
good
body
but
the
earthy
flavors
are
just
too
much
j
this
pours
a
warming
amberred
with
a
sticky
piney
aroma
theres
a
piney
hop
presence
with
a
touch
of
caramel
stickiness
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
what
a
red
ale
should
be
this
beer
hits
all
the
marks
overall
fantastic
strong
imperial
red
lovely
lags
nose
but
the
amber
on
the
palate
ruined
this
for
me
excellent
beer
the
color
is
beautiful
kind
of
a
dark
copper
and
i
love
the
roasted
malt
not
a
lot
of
hops
which
was
fine
not
as
good
as
there
old
lucky
13
and
if
you
had
lucky
13
then
you
know
what
i
mean
lol
yummmmmmmmmyy
hoppy
bitter
red
ale
overall
a
very
solid
red
ale
overall
and
something
i
will
definitely
pick
up
again
so
good
like
a
red
ipa
a
really
nice
red
big
hops
but
relatively
subdued
because
of
the
carbonation
level
nice
bitter
bite
and
pine
overlaying
some
grapefruit
o
smooth
rjt
wellbalanced
flavor
but
i
like
more
of
a
chewy
malty
mouthfeel
with
this
style
overall
this
is
a
good
but
not
terribly
complex
beer
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
liking
i
would
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
again
not
as
malty
as
expected
in
a
red
but
that
is
why
the
imperial
comes
in
i
was
actually
hoping
for
more
maltiness
but
enjoyed
this
beer
the
color
and
head
are
wonderful
with
a
wonderful
ipa
smell
the
finish
is
smoother
than
most
imp
ipas
great
balance
of
hop
malt
and
alcohol
never
too
much
of
either
to
produce
a
easy
drinking
stronger
brew
label
sez
its
an
exhumation
of
their
very
first
ale
hitting
that
perfect
balance
may
have
something
to
do
with
this
solid
brewerys
consistent
standing
and
respect
thanks
for
a
real
enjoyable
wellcrafted
bomber
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
bitter
pine
hop
flavor
with
slight
grapefruit
accent
and
mild
tangy
yeast
with
subtle
tangerine
and
a
light
caramel
from
the
malt
in
the
taste
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
has
plenty
of
hops
with
noticeable
alcohol
but
not
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
strength
i
would
drink
this
again
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
sweet
and
hop
forward
i
got
this
22
oz
bomber
yesterday
and
i
pour
the
brew
into
tulip
glassware
thick
2
fingers
foam
stay
atop
for
30
to
40
seconds
while
the
aromas
relieve
sweet
fruity
i
tasted
it
and
it
tasted
really
good
hazy
red
amber
bodied
with
sweet
note
on
the
end
great
beer
for
amber
ale
overall
well
built
red
ale
that
should
please
hop
fans
i
sure
enjoyed
it
enjoyed
from
a
bomber
this
red
ale
pours
a
thick
copper
red
color
with
a
firm
off
white
head
and
solid
lacing
nose
of
biscuit
sweet
malts
as
well
as
citrus
and
pine
hops
flavors
follow
the
taste
with
grapefruit
orange
peel
caramel
and
biscuit
like
malts
and
a
bittering
hops
in
the
background
a
decent
imperial
red
although
more
of
a
red
ipa
the
beer
poured
a
deep
copper
mahogany
color
with
a
substantial
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
a
piney
and
citrusy
hop
with
a
bit
of
toffee
malt
underneath
the
taste
followed
with
an
initial
sweet
malt
that
quickly
jumped
into
a
mega
hop
dose
of
slight
resinous
pine
and
more
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
bitterness
it
leaves
a
burnt
toffee
and
hop
bitterness
on
your
tongue
between
pulls
and
even
has
hints
of
floral
hops
as
the
flavor
lingers
this
imperial
red
ale
from
lagunitas
has
me
back
on
the
red
ale
fence
22oz
bottle
poured
in
pint
glass
beer
is
red
amber
as
promised
with
a
thick
orangeish
head
big
piney
chop
aroma
could
be
an
imperial
ipa
if
the
color
didnt
push
into
into
the
red
ale
category
flavorwise
too
this
is
hopforward
full
of
left
coast
sensibilities
finish
is
pretty
dry
and
light
for
what
an
imperial
amber
could
have
been
this
is
not
too
malty
or
syrupy
there
is
a
little
nuance
of
residual
sweetness
but
it
works
quite
nicely
here
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
west
coast
red
ale
and
well
worth
enjoying
deep
caramel
notes
in
the
nose
with
almost
none
on
the
tongue
a
slight
toffee
sweetness
giving
way
to
a
big
spicy
citrusy
hop
tang
o
a
very
above
average
red
ale
smooth
and
very
well
balanced
as
expected
another
lagunitas
ale
that
rules
and
this
one
can
not
only
appease
a
hopscraving
but
also
placate
a
hankering
for
malts
to
an
extent
overall
4

this
is
a
textbook
red
ale
if
ive
ever
had
one
bordering
on
perfection
in
my
opinion
the
flavors
and
the
way
they
are
balanced
is
superb
this
and
nugget
nectar
stand
out
above
all
the
other
red
ales
that
ive
experienced
another
amazing
beer
for
the
price
probably
towards
the
top
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
beers
good
stuff
like
the
other
reviewers
say
healthy
full
rustic
still
got
the
grapefruit
strawberry
other
fruity
and
slightly
tart
notes
and

is
sort
of
perfect
abv
perfect
for
early
autumn
great
anytime
grab
this
for
the
weekend
gamewatching
cooking
out
or
what
have
you
o
the
red
ale
was
once
the
darling
of
the
craft
beer
movement
no
more
in
fact
most
hardened
beer
geeks
tend
to
avoid
them
like
a
plague
the
style
has
a
reputation
for
being
bland
and
uninteresting
these
days
however
if
you
are
going
to
brew
a
red
ale
and
expect
it
to
sell
this
is
how
you
do
it
you
make
sure
its
big
and
plenty
hoppy
there
is
nothing
bland
or
pedestrian
about
this
beer
its
worth
your
time
and
money
yum
fairly
hoppy
a
touch
of
a
malt
base
solid
when
fresh
overall
a
fine
brew
worth
grabbing
every
fall

delicious
poured
into
a
large
snifter
from
a
22oz
bomber
it
has
a
light

color
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
it
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
light

note
and
a
hoppy

it
tastes
great
its
very
balanced
with
a
sweet
malty
medium
body
and
a
light
hoppy
bite
it
has
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
great
red
will
definitely
buy
again
o
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
this
is
so
good
excellent
hoppy
red
ale
that
is
balanced

could

good

really

on

at

usually
like
hoppy
red

disappointed
overall
especially
compared
with
other
lagunitas
brews
nothing
stood
out
except
for
bitterness
not
well
balanced
with
caramel
malt
not
sure
if
there
may
have
been
an
issue
with
their
lines
well
hell
they
say
a
lot
of
lagunitas
beers
taste
the
same
and
theyre
right
they
all
taste
good
i
can
see
how
this
could
be
linked
to
any
number
of
lagunitas
beers
as
far
as
taste
but
so
what
its
too
damn
good
to
gripe
about
pours
a

followed
by
some
citrus
hops
grapefruit
orange
and
a
bit
of
sugar
cant
tell
if
its
my
nose
playing
tricks
but
the
combined
aromas
give
it
a
candy
type
smell
the
taste
features
more
malts
with
sweet
caramel
leading
the
way
with
some
brown

added

malts

a

this

i
feel
like
i
could
have
two
more
in
the
next
hour
the
alcohol
is
masked
expertly
with
very
little
sign
of
its
moderate

not
much
carbonation
overall
another
solid
entry
from

like
that

to
the
tropical
realm
although
the
latter
is
certainly
there
there
is
considerable
sweetness
here
even

tastes
sweet
said
your

the
aggressive

keeps
this

ibu
might
not
seem
like
a
lot
but
its
just
right
for
this
brew
maybe
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
in
there
as
well
and
some
malty
sweetness
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
in
this
but
at
7
8
its
pretty
potent
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
not
a
sticky
beer
though
carbonation
is
great
fits
with
the
style
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
excellent
example
of
the
modern
red
ale
is
it
an
ipa
is
it
a
red
no
its
somewhere
in
between
and
i
love
it
just
the
way
it
is
lagunitas
never
disappoints
i
have
somewhat
unconsciously
enjoyed
this
style
for
a
while
and
i
cant
say
this
interpretation
fails
but
the
drying
nature
of
this
beer
battles
what
i
have
generally
enjoyed
about
the
style
i
the
past
overall
solid
red
good
for
the
price
o
a
solid
imperial
red
ale
that
delivers
on
both
maltiness
and
a
decent
amount
of
hoppiness
nice
and
easy
to
drink
at
a
good
value
worth
a
shot
like
the
aroma
there
is
a
good
malty
start
and
a
biting
hop
finale
it
lingers
for
a
bit
on
the
end
reds
are
usually
rather
eh
for
me
this
one
was
one
the
better
ones
i
had
had
in
recent
years
winner

chicken

great
balance
on

nice

may
i
add
also
that
the
price
point
makes
this
a
click
to
pick
abv
delivers
a
nice
little
wallop
this
is
not
a
cheap
beer
but
a
reasonably
priced
brew
all
around
a
tremendously
tremendous
beer
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
lagunitas
my
neighbor
found
a
bottle
and
shared
it

the
beer
poured
a

clear
with
thick
white
head
that
laced
like
a
vicky
secret

the
scent
and
taste
had
sweet

with

balance
the

was
medium
in

with
good
carbonation
overall

the
red
rocker
has
touched
down
in
the
antelope
valley
after
3
weeks
of
looking
for
this
in
the
beer
stores
a
friend
of
mine
came
in
to
work
and
told
me
he
just
got
two
imperial
red
ales
at
stator
brothers
grocery
store
i
asked
him
how
many
they
had
left
and
he
said
a
whole
row
by
the
time
i
got
in
there
they
had
two
left
and
i
gladly
bought
both
of
them
and
im
glad
i
did
great
very
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
citrus
this
is
one
of
those
once
a
year
beers
lagunitas
puts
out
so
if
you
see
it
grab
it
i
loved
it
7
8
abv
which
makes
this
a
nice
little
package
watching
the
last
of
summer
burn
off
outside
with
this
fine
brew
listening
to
some
doobie
brothers
and
it
was
indeeda
very
good
night
and
at
4
99
a
bottlegreat
deal
motley
out
o
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
like
the
hop
profile
in
their
lucky
13
or
whatever
number
it
was
just
a
little
more
glad
to
recommend
this
mofo
worth
picking
up
i
normally
base
my
beers
off
of
my
favorite
from
that
style
and
go
from
there
this
one
is
good
but
not
my
favorite
some
might
say
im
crazy
but
i
think
it
could
be
a
bit
maltier
its
no
where
near
as
hoppy
as
green
flash
hop
head
red
but
i
want
a
bit
more
sweetness
if
im
going
to
drink
an
amber
ale
id
rather
it
not
taste
like
an
ipa
with
a
touch
of
malt
the
taste
is
decently
bitter
and
it
lingers
more
on
the
hoppy
side
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
but
it
is
not
how
i
would
represent
the
style
overall
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
disappoint
but
doesnt
wow
me
either
i
really
enjoy
the
style
and
thought
the
beer
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
especially
considering
the
4
65
price
for
a
bomber
this
is
often
compared
to
nugget
nectar
and
im
not
sure
why
anyway
this
brew
has
a
great
appearancenot
an
exceptional
color
but
a
very
nice
thick
head
and
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
unremarkable
but
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
this
is
also
highly
drinkable
as
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
for
the
style
whatever
style
you
want
to
call
this
hybrid
anyway
adding
a
lot
of
hops
to
an
otherwise
successful
red
ale
just
doesnt
workeven
though
i
love
hops
i
love
the
great
bomber
price
but
the
imperial
red
ale
falls
short
as
the
balance
is
lost
and
the
style
is
compromised
in
an
effort
to
appease
hopheads
including
myself
girlfriend
apparently
i
cant
say
apparently
without
the
boyfriend
giving
me
shit
about
the
apparently
boy
anyways
apparently
im
not
too
fond
of
the
hops
i
did
not
trade
any
of
my
black
rhinos
black
ale
for
it
overall
another
great
brew
by
lagunitas
with
tons
of
fantastic
flavor
and
at
one
fantastic
bomber
price
they
are
consistently
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
breweries
for
the
cost
well
done
o
this
is
like
the
west
coast
version
of
nugget
nectar
and
i
will
be
purchasing
more
bottles
overall
not
quite
the
level
i
expect
from
lagunitas
and
certainly
not
in
the
same
ballpark
as
their
other
imperial
red
they
release

a
satisfying
easydrinking
strong
beer
i
would
prefer
some
more
emphasis
on
the
malt
but
hopheads
will
rejoice
in
this
one
a
pleasant
sienna
color
with
bright
red
highlights
along
the
edges
it
has
a
wonderfully
earthy
aroma
dare
i
say
with
a
hint
of
heather
it
certainly
has
a
lightly
bitter
tea
finish
it
is
well
balanced
and
smooth
but
there
is
also
a
little
bite
that
lingers
long
after
you
finish
also
despite
its
higher
abv
alcohol
notes
do
not
come
into
play
until
the
beer
has
warmed
slightly
to
complete
the
well
rounded
flavor
d
very
drinkable
this
beer
has
an
excellent
balance
of
malt
richness
and
spicy
american
hops
the
pine
and
citrus
hop
character
works
well
to
augment
the
caramel
malt
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
its
style
and
it
seems
to
bring
out
the
best
in
lagunitas
talent
for
brewing
hoppy
coppercolored
beers
d
and
big
drinkability
despite
the
beers
girth
heavyweight
all
in
all
a
great
brew
interesting
idea
the
imperial
red
kind
of
like
a
red
and
a
barleywine
put
together
nicely
done
drinkable
for
sure
but
not
as
complex
as
the
other
lagunitas
offerings
i
have
consumed
d
this
is
one
powerful
sucker
of
an
american
strong
ale
excellent
the
alcohol
is
masked
really
well
by
the
fullbodied
flavor
and
unique
smoky
hoppiness
the
beer
is
not
that
carbonated
for
an
imperial
red
at
only
7
abv
but
it
is
classified
as
an
american
strong
ale
i
would
say
for
an
asa
its
got
a
light
mouthfeel
but
for
an
imperial
red
more
carbonation
would
lighten
it
up
and
make
the
flavors
come
to
life
a
little
more
one
of
the
better
imperial
reds
i
have
had
but
lacking
complexity
for
an
asa
this
is
s
rich
wellcrafted
beer
that
doesnt
lack
character
as
most
lagunitas
brews
are
it
drinks
really
well
and
the
7
5
really
makes
it
worthwhile
i
too
can
drink
these
over
and
over
but
the
limited
availability
for
me
in
my
area
is
tough
and
a
note
this
is
a
premium
beer
at
a
price
to
match
treat
mode
indeed
enjoy
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
d
omg
prob
my
new
fav
am
strong
even
better
than
the
bastard
availability
is
my
only
concern
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
taste
comes
through
deliciously
hoppy
big
malt
backbone
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
slides
from
sweet
to
a
denser
heavier
feeling
on
the
palate
drinkable
sure
cant
really
say
what
is
better
this
or
the
lucky

the

if
not
very
similar

a
ruby
mahogonnay
with
a
moderate
offwhite

little
lacing
nose
is
of
hops
and
fruity
with
subtle
malt
taste
is
similar
citrusy
fruity
taste
with
plentiful
hops
but
a
nice
malt
layer
bitter
but
not
overly
so
it
makes
for
a
quite
nice
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
quite
drinkable
although
im
not
sure
whether
the
lennys
ripa
i
had
beforehand
aided
in
that
either
way
i
enjoyed
this
greatly
my
favorite
imperial
red
to
date
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
moderate
tan
head
it
smelled
like
juicy
orange
and
grapefruit
hops
with
sweet
honey
and
brown
sugar
and
roasted
barley
and
a
bit
of
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
copper
and
grapefruit
and
orange
hops
with
brown
sugar
and
roasted
barley
malts
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
great
scent
and
taste
for
a
red
ale
it
had
nice
body
too
and
hid
the
alcohol
very
well
so
it
was
definitely
easy
to
drink
this
seemed
to
use
the
same
hops
as
hop
stoopid
little
sumpin
sumpin
etc
only
with
a
more

which
surprised
me
after
the
minimal

significant

in

inhibits
drinkability
this
is
certainly
a
very
tasty
brew
but
not
one
id
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
with
a
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
medium

a

all
the

has
a

that
combines
the

the

give
a
strong

bit
it
burns
off
to
a
nice

taste
with
a
sweet

a
very
nice
brew
this
is
definitely
made
to
sip
and
is
not
a
session
beer
feels
like
it
has
a
bit
of
potency
to
it
d
this
is
very
drinkable
for
a
fallwinter
offering
i
will
have
a
hard
time
sharing
this
6pack
but
at
7
5
will
need
to
stretch
it
out
over
a
few
sessions
this
is
so
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
could
get
you
in
trouble
beware
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
im
not
experienced
with
imperial
reds
and
i
was
stoked
when
i
was
confronted
with
a
hop
bomb
a
good
one
at
that
this
beer
is
worth
trying
with
out
doubt
and
for
7
5
it
drinks
like
water
so
watch
out
d
incredibly
sweet
with
no
depth
of
flavour
this
one
was
a
big
letdown
drain
pour
after
a
few
sips
d
imperial
red
is
another
great
example
of
a
wellcrafted
brew
from
lagunitas
everything
about
this
beer
is
top
notch
from
the
beautiful
color
and
foamy
head
to
the
wonderful
hop
aromas
and
perfect
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
flavors
verdict
a
very
typical
lagunitasstyle
beer
imperial
red
ale
is
another
satisfying
and
serviceable
brew
from
the
crew
in
petaluma
im
not
sure
if
the
imperial
red
style
is
going
to
take
off
but
this
beer
makes
a
decent
case
for
the
experimental
style
the
alcohol
is
there
but
by
no
means
is
it
overpowering
those
expecting
a
west
coast
hopbomb
will
not
be
disappointed
here
but
this
one
has
a
twist
to
it
what
it
lacks
in
head
and
lacing
is
more
than
made
up
for
in
the
depth
of
the
taste
for
the
fall
i
couldnt
think
of
a
better
beer
to
have
from
the
golden
state
with
the
exception
of
a
sierra
nevada
or
anchor
seasonal
its
stuff
like
this
that
makes
me
realize
how
much
i
miss
the
golden
state
and
what
it
has
to
offer
this
has
just
the
right
mix
of
an
ipa
and
a
fall
seasonal
with
a
touch
of
lingering
spice
to
tie
them
together
a
great
beer
for
autumn
very
good
strong
beer
warming
after
a
glassfull
one
of
my
favs
from
lagunitas
each
year
i
love
the
hoppy
boldness
and
relatively
good
drinkibility
of
this
for
an
imperial
red
ale
one
of
the
better
sixpack
buys
out
there
as
well
imho
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
that
im
glad
i
tried
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
a
pasta
dish
and
it
held
its
own
very
well
complemented
the
food
and
did
not
overpower
yet
its
character
remained
strong
if
you
like
an
ale
with
character
give
this
one
a
try
medium
bodied
with
enough
carbonation
overall
agreat
beer
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
light
enough
in
body
to
make
the
pint
go
down
fast
another
winner
from
these
guys
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
reported
that
it
was
more
like
a
red
colored
sierra
nevada
torpedo
im
not
really
sure
what
i
was
thinking
the
nose
and
taste
of
this
dark
red
ale
have
some
wood
aromasflavors
and
the
hop
profile
is
lots
and
lots
of
pine
the
hops
flavor
here
is
almost
like
a
thick
resiny
hop
syrup
that
coats
the
tongue
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
could
sit
and
have
23
of
d
this
beer
is
perfect
on
a
cool
fall
night
very
tasty
and
really
sweet
tastes
like
liquid
candy
a
decently
tasty
beer
but
a
boring
one
for
a
good
red
of
this
style
try
ithacas
cascazilla
really
a
big
beer
gotta
be
in
the
mood
for
a
sipper
d
reasonable
for
the
style
certainly
not
a
struggle
to
get
down
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
have
too
many
in
a
row
medium
to
full
in
body
with
an
ample
amount
of
carbonation
that
seems
just
right
for
this
beer
long
lingering
bitterness
that
just
begs
for
another
sip
overall
very
unique
taste
albeit
more
subtle
than
its
sister
brew
and
my
favorite
the
maximus
nice
for
slow
sipping
and
savoring
late
at
night
when
you
can
take
your
time
try
listening
to
cool
jazz
in
the
process
d
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
not
one
you
could
drink
all
evening
but
an
awesome
example
of
a
style
thats
hard
to
put
your
finger
on
and
great
for
sipping
d
theres
not
a
ton
going
on
here
and
it
really
plays
to
this
beers
advantage
it
does
a
few
things
and
does
them
really
well
solid
beer
i
wish
there
would
have
been
some
more
flavors
maybe
some
sweetness
i
e
caramel
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
really
good
flavor
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
a
7
2
abv
session
worthy
in
taste
for
sure
rotation
avail
here
this
will
be
a
regular
in
the
hops
and
session
rotation
had
on
cask
at
the
old
toad
pours
very
rich
looking
out
of
the
tap
very
smooth
frothy
lacing
on
the
sides
the
head
bows
into
the
center
because
of
the
lack
of
carbonation
deep
amber
red
color
very
hazy
but
appealing
aroma
is
full
of
both
caramel
malt
tones
and
citrus
hops
both
of
which
are
strongly
present
in
the
beer
but
not
overwhelmingly
assertive
the
flavors
blend
well
with
the
low
carbonation
and
cask
character
of
the
beer
alcohol
is
not
present
in
the
taste
at
all
and
it
is
drinkable
like
a
mild
ale
a
nice
amber
red
with
2
fingers
of
khaki
head
resulting
from
a
rigorous
pour
smell
is
piney
citrus
hop
aroma
delicious
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
malt
a
lot
more
than
the
smell
would
imply
a
good
amount
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
less
than
in
the
nose
a
slight
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
all
in
all
very
clean
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
like
an
ipa
but
with
less
bitterness
and
more
caramel
malt
delicious
drinkability
a
solid
beer
as
lagunitas
always
does
one
of
the
most
consistant
breweries
out
there
mouthfeel
leaves
an
expected
hop
oilyness
with
no
syrupy
sweetness
nothing
too
overpowering
md
the
feel
is
smooth
although
the
flavor
is
big
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
go
down
as
easy
as
it
did
the
hoppy
sense
of
this
fades
with
warming
while
the
malts
are
kicked
up
and
thus
eventually
winning
the
battle
making
for
a
sweetsmooth
ride
medium
bodied
with
near
perfect
carbonation
it
was
a
bit
high
in
the
beginning
the
drinkability
is
i
want
another
right
now
because
my
glass
is
empty
damn
i
should
of
picked
more
of
this
up
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamcolored
cap
of
foam
a
good
amount
of
lacing
persists
and
creates
a
nice
rim
around
the
glass
a
whiff
of
hops
on
the
aroma
that
seems
a
little
subdued
but
is
definitely
pleasant
and
inviting
the
hops
come
through
on
the
first
sip
with
a
nice
bitter
grapefruit
body
thats
strengthened
by
a
sturdy
backbone
of
grains
and
roasted
malt
characters
nicely
balanced
between
malt
and
hop
medium
body
with
some
weight
provided
by
the
maltiness
paired
with
a
nice
lifting
quality
of
the
hops
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
good
choice
for
some
one
who
likes
hops
but
isnt
into
dipas
or
any
other
super
hoppy
concoctions
a
wellbalanced
hoppy
affair
another
fine
lagunitas
fantastic
beer
hoppy
and
malty
and
very
well
balanced
i
love
that
the
hops
remind
me
of
an
imperial
ipa
but
the
big
malt
character
adds
a
caramel
big
red
soda
flavor
to
it
i
love
big
hoppy
brews
and
beers
that
are
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
hop
bomb
and
a
malt
bomb
and
a
very
tasty
one
mediumheavy
in
the
mouth
with
a
silky
syrupy
feel
very
drinkable
and
a
sixpack
is
a
must
i
could
and
do
drink
on
this
all
night
a
great
goto
for
any
occasion
overall
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
lagunitas
however
considering
i
havent
had
much
in
the
strong
ale
department
id
say
this
would
be
a
goto
in
the
category
but
in
general
its
not
my
favorite
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
beer
very
flavorful
and
i
want
more
sits
well
too
d
i
love
hoppedup
amberred
ales
the
aroma
of
this
beer
really
pulled
me
in
and
i
was
intrigued
with
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
from
lagunitas
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
held
well
and
settled
to
just
covering
the
beer
and
a
fair
amount
of
spotty
lace
strong
aromas
of
hops
alcohol
pine
hints
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
its
all
about
the
hops
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
bready
malt
then
bang
hops
take
over
finishing
with
a
bitter
after
taste
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
hop
flavor
outweighs
the
bitterness
on
this
beer
and
i
love
it
pineapple
green
apples
pine
needles
and
a
bit
of
ganja
all
come
to
the
hop
party
and
are
balanced
somewhat
by
a
sweet
crackery
malt
while
i
cant
say
that
i
like
this
better
than
lucky
13
this
is
still
a
damn
fine
beer
its
very
refreshing
and
damn
near
chuggable
excellent
beer
cures
my
hop
craving
easily
could
really
hang
around
and
drink
two
or
three
of
these
but
beware
of
the
higher
abv
a
really
great
take
on
a
red
ale
not
your
typical
boring
red
d
very
smooth
despite
the
hint
of
booziness
on
the
nose
the
alcohol
is
undetectable
in
the
mouth
this
goes
down
too
easy
for
a
7
2
abv
beverage
d
extremely
wellbalanced
beer
smooth
despite
the
alcohol
content
very
easy
to
drink
d
i
wanted
more
malt
from
a
red
not
so
much
hops
its
a
good
compromise
in
general
but
for
the
style
too
hoppy
mediumfull
bodied
smooth
and
drinkable
in
spite
of
a
healthy
alcohol
content
definitely
for
the
hop
lover
but
balanced
by
a
decent
malt
backbone
dgiven
the
7
5
abv
i
wouldnt
qualify
this
as
a
sessionable
beer
but
its
a
very
nice
sipper
i
love
this
beer
just
dont
drink
it
cold
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
enjoy
this
wonderful
sipper
d
fairly
good
for
the
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
d
for
its
abv
the
beer
is
dangerously
sessionable
the
guys
at
lagunitas
dont
mess
around
imperial
red
is
yet
another
great
example
of
what
these
guys
do
i
love
hoppy
reds
and
this
one
is
no
exception
though
id
probably
put
it
a
notch
below
the
best
in
the
style
nonetheless
its
very
drinkable
and
a
very
good
beer
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
strong
ale
when
i
bought
it
the
abv
on
this
can
sneak
up
on
you
so
be
careful
dpretty
easy
to
drink
but
with
the
higher
alcohol
not
quite
sessionable
very
glad
that
we
have
access
to
this
one
i
can
forsee
it
being
a
very
frequent
visitor
to
my
beer
fridge
mouth
is
slightly
dry
and
really
perfectly
carbonated
drinks
all
day
long
alcohol
is
noticeable
with
the
fruity
maltiness
and
a
grainy
structure
develops
in
the
mouth
with
a
touch
of
pine
softness
a
bit
sour
though
on
the
mouth
decent
body
and
relatively
wellbalanced
finish
with
a
mild
carbonation
that
is
not
overwhelming
smooth
mouthfeelgreat
drinkability
super
nice
d
although
i
love
hoppy
beers
this
one
really
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
cant
really
see
myself
drinking
much
of
it
i
know
the
hop
heads
may
disagree
but
i
have
had
much
better
beers
from
lagunitas
d
i
think
i
could
drink
a
million
probably
the
thickest
session
beer
i
would
endorse
overall
very
well
balanced
and
fabtastic
flavor
d
another
rock
solid
brew
from
lagunitas
im
starting
to
notice
a
trend
this
was
an
incredible
red
ale
very
well
balanced
and
much
more
flavorful
than
most
others
though
im
surprised
ba
has
it
listed
as
a
strong
ale
this
is
one
you
should
make
it
a
point
to
find
and
try
appearance
is
darker
than
i
had
expected
very
dark
brown
the
head
on
it
is
small
and
with
a
couple
sips
all
that
is
left
is
a
lilly
pad
on
tap
with
ring
around
it
smell
has
hops
a
burnt
flora
aroma
as
well
taste
is
rich
with
a
sweetness
and
a
finish
of
dryness
mouthfeel
has
a
strong
character
barley
comes
out
bitterness
along
with
more
of
the
dryness
drinkability
is
about
average
more
due
to
the
bitterness
and
dryness
than
the
abv
d
daaamn
im
glad
i
got
a
sixpack
of
this
much
better
than
the
mondo
13
imperial
red
edit
i
actually
bought
about
7
sixpacks
of
this
in
2009
i
just
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
comes
in
balanced
then
averts
to
the
hop
flavor
which
into
flows
directly
into
a
very
sweet
almost
delicate
piney
taste
that
is
better
than
expected
this
beers
texture
and
balance
really
sells
me
on
it
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
taste
is
exact
enough
to
be
comforting
and
just
different
enough
to
make
me
understand
just
what
lagunitas
has
to
offer
is
better
then
the
rest
pretty
good
this
beer
is
an
awesome
treat
review
reads
slightly
skewed
vs
tmd
all
getting
4s
that
is
solely
based
on
mad
rivers
double
dread
which
for
me
is
a
defining
imperial
red
lagunitas
has
brewed
another
treasure
and
is
an
absolute
must
hops
most
assertive
in
front
finish
and
as
part
of
a
very
complex
hoppy
coffee
finish
i
like
this
one
a
lot
definitely
a
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
as
its
pretty
hefty
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
another
nice
release
form
lagunitas
how
many
strong
hoppy
beers
will
you
guys
brew
i
say
there
will
never
be
enough
so
keep
em
coming
drinks
too
easy
i
could
stay
on
this
for
3
or
4
bottles
no
problem
d
easy
drinker
but
a
bit
too
strong
to
be
a
session
in
both
the
hops
and
booze
department
really
a
nice
tasting
beer
hits
the
notes
that
it
needs
to
without
being
overpowering
leans
more
towards
the
hop
side
but
is
nice
i
think
this
is
the
beer
that
stones
13th
anniversary
wanted
to
be
d
you
can
definitely
feel
the
abv
in
this
one
not
that
its
off
the
charts
but
the
rich
tapestry
of
flavors
and
strong
ale
elements
would
lead
me
to
only
a
couple
of
these
by
no
means
a
session
red
ale
this
lagunitas
offering
is
interesting
and
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
on
especially
of
you
love
big
strong
ales
like
arrogant
bastard
or
long
trail
double
bag
easily
the
best
imperial
red
ive
had
for
the
money
and
a
new
favorite
from
lagunitas
itll
be
a
shame
to
see
this
seasonal
fall
off
the
shelves
cheers
very
creamy
and
full
and
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
make
for
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
went
ahead
and
bought
a
whole
case
as
ive
already
been
through
about
half
of
it
d
really
have
to
enjoy
hop
driven
beer
to
drink
more
than
one
the
consistency
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
full
palate
of
flavors
there
is
a
nice
earthy
and
toasted
malt
flavor
lots
of
chicory
bark
and
smokey
flavors
there
is
a
nice
hop
bitterness
a
bit
leafy
drying
but
well
balanced
and
complementary
to
the
malty
base
of
the
beer
the
hop
has
a
bit
of
a
minty
and
piney
cast
to
it
but
overall
it
is
drying
and
leafy
and
nicely
bittering
there
is
a
roasted
slightly
charred
drying
and
smokey
flavor
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
and
beyond
the
beer
is
fairly
complex
thick
creamy
and
a
nice
find
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
there
is
no
booziness
in
the
beer
at
all
very
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
pretty
darn
drinkable
so
unique
that
i
think
this
would
taste
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
dead
of
winter
or
anywhere
in
between
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
different
hops
including
some
piney
and
citrusy
notes
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
piney
hops
followed
by
some
grapefruit
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
incredibly
hoppy
but
balanced
well
enough
to
be
completely
drinkable
another
good
offering
from
lagunitas
notes
it
is
full
of
character
and
yet
i
think
that
outsiders
could
give
it
a
successful
try
if
they
are
a
bit
open
minded
it
is
not
quite
an
ipa
although
it
is
like
a
deviant
malty
cousin
to
love
reminds
me
of
their
lucky
13
but
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
that
and
may
need
to
have
it
again
to
compare
bottle
says
limited
release
but
not
as
drinkable
this
beer
is
definitely
the
first
category
taste
is
aggressively
hopped
in
a
good
way
sharper
and
more
pronounced
flower
and
pine
characters
than
i
would
normally
expect
from
a
red
ale
theres
the
fruitiness
i
detect

is

carbonation
not
bad
didnt
do
much
for
me
cheers
i
would
love
to
session
this
on
tap
although
i
doubt
id
be
fortunate
to
find
it
a
drinkable
red
if
you
like
them
bitter
if
not
stay
away
overall
this
has
a
big
strong
bold
flavor
a
6er
of
this
and
you
would
be
feeling
just
right
drinkability
fine
overall
this
beer
is
good
just
a
little
booring
pours
a
hazy
amber
copper
color
with
a
good
sized
creamy
cream
colored
head
that
recedes
very
slowly
and
laces
the
glass
nicely
there
is
some
faint
citrus
aroma
along
with
sweetness
from
the
malts
white
grapey
and
spritelike
sweetness
taste
is
well
balanced
although
the
hops
again
only
present
a
mild
citrus
flavor
and
the
mats
are
sugary
sweet
there
is
a
nice
hop
balance
with
some
dryness
and
bitterness
medium
in
body
sugary
with
a
silky
smooth
creaminess
nice
example
of
a
strong
ale
incredibly
easy
to
drink
not
super
hoppy
like
some
but
just
well
balanced
and
tasty
drinkability
the
bitterness
is
too
much
and
the
taste
isnt
enough
to
keep
me
interested
in
this
beer
ive
gone
through
one
pint
and
have
no
interest
in
trying
more
im
not
so
unimpressed
to
give
it
a
label
of
being
unimpressive
40
63
ibus
according
to
the
label
but
this
has
a
larger
profile
than
indicated
assertive
bitter
hop
character
dominates
the
palate
to
begin
which
is
supplanted
by
a
malty
sweetness
by
midsip
iced
tea
flavor
which
was
present
in
the
nose
is
here
as
well
with
the
delicate
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
an
interesting
beer
not
sure
i
would
categorize
it
as
a
strong
ale
but
it
is
good
nonetheless
drinkability
though
the
hops
can
be
a
little
cutting
at
times
its
a
rather
likeable
red
ale
and
quite
quaffable
great
tastingrefreshingjuicy
i
want
moremoremore
extremely
drinkable
even
with
the
tounge
feeling
like
it
just
trippled
in
size
it
initially
tastes
like
juicy
mandarin
oranges
and
it
bitters
with
time
i
get
more
caramel
as
the
beer
warms
along
with
subtle
alcohol
tones
the
finnish
is
almost
cottony
dry
and
i
find
sharing
a
sixpack
over
a
single
conversation
to
be
trivial
not
only
was
this
a
solid
winner
it
also
served
to
reinforce
my
opinion
of
lagunitas
i
really
like
everything
that
they
are
doing
and
hope
to
visit
during
whf2
summer
tour
2007
good
beer
though
really
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
very
sweet
for
an
ipa
caramel
like
sweetness
i
guess
this
imperial
red
category
is
a
new
trend
ive
tried
the
terrapin
hoppy
monster
and
this
lagunitas
has
a
little
more
hops
showing
thru
and
had
a
much
larger
head
on
it
i
can
see
why
they
call
these
beers
red
though
the
color
when
under
a
light
is
tranlucent
so
vibrant
with
dark
ruby
overtones
one
other
difference
between
a
dbl
ipa
and
a
red
imperial
ale
seems
to
be
more
malty
and
less
hoppy
bitternes
the
extra
malts
do
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
high
alcohol
level
d
tasty
but
nothing
spectacular
in
my
book
22
oz
bomber
11
oz
sample
the
beer
pours
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
ivory
head
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
over
top
the
clarity
is
fairly
good
and
the
carbonation
is
minimal
the
nose
is
nice
as
well
there
is
a
moderate
caramel
maly
with
a
solid
biscuity
character
that
adds
a
graineyness
to
the
brew
there
is
a
nice
moderate
earthy
hop
in
there
that
adds
nicely
to
the
grainyness
of
the
malt
i
like
the
earthy
quality
of
the
beer
the
flavor
is
very
nice
it
is
incredibly
strong
in
earthy
british
hops
that
pairs
well
with
a
solid
biscuit
malt
graineyness
there
is
a
mild
caramel
malt
behind
it
that
adds
sweetness
that
really
rounds
things
out
the
bitterness
really
hits
nicely
on
the
finish
while
maintaining
some
reserve
and
not
being
offensive
this
is
a
nice
tasting
brew
the
feel
is
thick
with
a
solid
modeate
carbonation
to
it
i
am
a
fan
of
this
brew
even
though
the
earthy
flavors
are
not
my
favorite
i
think
this
one
makes
them
very
approchable
it
is
defiantely
very
approachable
even
with
the
strong
biscuity
character
and
the
earthy
flavors
i
will
grab
more
of
this
in
the
future
terrapin
big
hoppy
monster
was
the
first
beer
i
have
had
that
claimed
to
be
an
imperial
red
ale
and
this
is
the
second
one
that
i
have
run
across
with
that
claim
the
beer
poured
exceptionally
clear
and
had
a
hue
that
was
amber
tinged
with
ruddy
pink
the
head
was
two
fingers
high
and
the
carbonation
was
steady
and
finely
textured
so
the
head
lingered
on
while
the
looks
were
quite
stunning
the
mild
aroma
was
subtly
redolent
with
citric
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
quite
balanced
for
the
style
with
the
bitter
hops
being
just
a
little
more
dominant
than
the
succulent
caramel
and
pale
malts
the
hoppy
aftertaste
was
supplemented
by
saltwater
taffy
like
mouthfeel
that
was
both
sticky
and
mineralized
dry
at
the
same
time
it
did
however
feel
thinner
than
what
the
label
description
suggested
although
classified
as
an
american
strong
ale
around
here
i
find
this
to
be
lot
more
similar
to
a
standard
or
a
double
ipa
at
first
it
was
hard
to
believe
they
rate
this
at
84
20
ibu
which
is
starting
to
approach
ruination
territory
but
as
the
pint
glass
neared
emptiness
and
the
hop
burps
reached
a
crescendo
the
realization
hit
that
i
had
basically
been
immunized
with
pacific
northwest
hops
may
i
have
more
please
beer

a

combination

is
a
wonderful
blend
of
malty

and
a
nice
blast
of
citrusy

mouthfeel

full
for
the

carbonated

very
good
the

this
beer
is
extremely
smackable
and
recommended
to
those
who
enjoy
a
malty
beer
that
is
well
hopped
all
in
all
another
solid
beer
from
lagunitas
its
seasonal
so
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
the
drinkabilty
of
the
beer
is
scary
because
it
goes
down
so
smooth
you
forget
about
the
alcohol
content
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
coppercolored
with
a
halfinch
of
beige
lumpy
froth
that
lingers
long
faint
aroma
of
doughey
malt
and
ripe
fruits
some
grainy
brown
sugar
plus
a
subtle
hop
aroma
riding
beneath
flavor
of
light
brown
sugar
malt
some
toasted
malt
notes
piney
hops
and
the
slightest
sting
of
abv
a
grapefruit
peel
bitterness
lingers
mellowed
slighlty
by
a
malt
sweetness
good
balanced

mouthfeel
is
full

and
satisfying
thanks
to

for

undercut
by
a
pleasantly
grating

the

is
all
hops
drilling
a
hole
through
the
roof
of
my
mouth
lovely
leavening
off
into
a
lingering

feedback
and

the

curls
around

fading
middling

another
good
one
from

poured
a
deep
dark
red
what
little
head
there
was
disappeared
quickly
smells
immediately
of
hops
with
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
and
then
the
malt
it
tastes
almost
exactly
as
the
smell
would
lead
you
to
believe
clear
almost
surprising
hops
up
front
then
a
little
bit
fruity
and
sweetly
malty
finishes
dry
with
another
little
hop
kick
maybe
the
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
as
the
ingredients
are
listed
as
hops
malt
hops
yeast
hops
water
and
hops
if
i
havent
made
my
point
by
now
this
is
a
special
ale
with
some
extra
hops
thrown
in
good
stuff
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
considering
its
abv
it
makes
for
a
great
change
of
pace
but
id
have
to
be
careful
with
this
baby
d
i
could
kick
back
and
drink
a
few
of
these
someone
call
my
work
im
calling
in
sick
if
you
love
hairy
eyeball
and
brown
shugga
youll
probably
love
this
one
too
becuase
i
do
lagunitas
brews
quite
a
few
good
but
far
from
outstanding
beers
just
when
i
consider
writing
them
off
as
an
alsoran
in
the
cutthroat
world
of
calfornia
craft
beer
i
drink
a
brown
shugga
or
a
lagunitas
ipa
or
a
cappuccino
stout
and
now
i
can
add
imperial
red
ale
to
that
distinguished
list
this
is
great
beer
folks
especially
if
youre
a
quart
low
on
hops
saying
what
mouth
enters
with
a
light
fruity
bitterness
up
front
and
a
huge
long
lasting
dry
bitter
finish
this
is
the
epitome
of
grapefruit
flavored
hops
some
pitted
fruit
apricot
in
the
fore
flavor
excellent
carbonation
all
the
way
through
in
spite
of
its
rather
flat
appearance
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
one
i
would
enjoy
with
light
appetizer
fare
like
buffalo
wings
also
a
very
nice
selection
to
sit
with
on
a
warm
summer
day
try
one
for
yourself
if
you
have
the
chance
d
good
one
of
the
better
lagunitas
beers
on
the
market
this
offering
from
lagunitas
delivers
a
maroon
foggy
body
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
west
coast
hops
herbal
sweet
baked
cookies
and
a
promising
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
the
opposite
of
the
nose
the
nasal
part
of
my
palate
was
thinking
sweet
malt
bomb
but
this
offering
came
at
me
with
a
brutal
bitter
hoppy
citrus
rind
pimp
slap
this
is
a
good
brew
and
balances
that
aggresive
hop
taste
with
some
toffee
goodness
that
again
ends
bitter
another
great
offering
from
lagunitas
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
orange
rind
and
grapefruit
but
also
some
pine
hoppiness
is
nice
and
fresh
not
just
bitter
loads
of
malt
somewhat
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
lagunitas
ipa
thick
sticky
lace
paints
the
side
of
the
glass
with
hardly
a
hole
to
see
through
it
this
is
a
serious
beer
the
more
i
drink
reds
the
more
i
enjoy
them
and
the
lagunitas
is
right
there
at
the
top
when
it
comes
to
reds
that
i
have
had
normal
carbonation
but
very
little
head
tons
of
different
citrus
flavors
flow
through
it
such
as
orange
and
pineapple
a
definite
must
for
any
red
ale
fan
or
actually
any
beer
fan
d
this
is
my
favorite
lagunitas
to
date
this
is
a
darn
good
red
ale
another
good
offering
from
lagunitas
deep
dark
red
color
with
a
very
slight
head
smell
is
a
bit
faint
but
has
a
sweet
malty
and
subtle
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malts
but
it
certainly
has
a
hoppy
enough
finish
to
balance
it
out
well
it
says
its
an
imperial
red
but
to
me
it
almost
tastes
like
a
barleywine
that
is
toned
down
just
a
bit
solid
throroughly
d
it
does
go
down
very
easily
and
for
something
that
has
a
slightly
high
abv
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
lose
track
of
how
many
youve
had
a
good
solid
beer
but
probably
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
nice
red
with
a
bolder
rendition
of
flavor
and
length
then
the
normal
reds
one
would
find
so
the
imperial
label
is
suiting
to
a
certain
degree
i
liked
the
play
in
textures
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
good
to
boot
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
picking
some
more
up
from
bevmo
on
my
next
run
assuming
theyre
not
all
out
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
appropriate
carbonation
bitterness
is
kind
of
tough
to
keep
the
drinkability
high
d
pretty
good
red
slighly
on
the
heavy
side
does
not
go
down
as
easily
as
some
nevertheless
good
tasting
beer
clear
deep
amber
color
light
tan
foam
reaches
a
full
inch
and
holds
nicely
good
streaming
carbonation
throughout
smell
is
mild
with
a
caramel
malt
and
sweet
grassy
hop
mix
flavor
begins
without
much
complexity
the
bitterness
hits
first
and
finally
i
can
detect
some
nutty
malt
it
just
really
misses
the
front
of
the
tongue
lots
of
hop
presence
but
its
a
bit
dank
and
leaves
a
slight
sourness
afterward
the
alcohol
is
fairly
noticible
mouthfeel
has
a
good
creaminess
and
sharp
carbonaion
not
bad
the
main
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
flavor
and
unfortunately
thats
the
most
important
part
worth
trying
but
i
wasnt
into
it
reddish
with
a
slight
haze
it
poured
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
reduced
to
a
ring
some
lacing
clean
pine
and
grapefruit
aroma
with
a
bit
of
caramel
thrown
in
lots
of
piney
hops
in
the
flavour
with
a
bit
of

this
is

pours

with
about
an

of

that
remains
as
a

the

of
sweet

with
a
bit

as
well
very
inviting
flavor
comes
first
from
the

and
a

bready
then
the

pop
up
with
a

at

is
just
shy
of
being
thick

creamy
with
just
the

now
if
they
could
only
start
showing
up
in
stores
around
here
very
fresh
and
mouthwatering
mmmmm
resinous
pine
the
balance
and
tasty

flavors
make
this
very
enjoyable
resinous
and

at
the

time
mmmm
i
love
a
balanced
brew
once
you
get
used
to
the
hops
this
is
a
great
beer
with
good
drinkability
and
excellent
flavor
while
im
not
as
much
of
a
hop
head
as
some
i
was
still
able
to
get
into
this
one
eventually
with
any
luck
i
might
be
able
to
id
the
hops
a
decent
imperial
red
but
i
still
prefer
offerings
from
bear
republic
and
others
impressive
hazy
orange
color
with
a
decent
thin
head
on
top
citrusy
aromareminds
me
of
the
smell
of
an
orange
lollypop
quite
the
mix
of
flavors
grapefruit
orange
baby
aspirin
but
in
a
good
way
fresh
cut
grass
and
spicesblack
pepper
the
funny
thing
is
they
all
work
together
leaves
a
sweet
sticky
flavor
on
my
lips
though
the
beer
itself
finishes
dry
good
body
overall
a
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
the
flavors
might
make
for
too
much
after
a
bottle
or
2
so
i
sort
of
knock
it
down
a
notch
in
drinkability
well
worth
a
try
however
d
easily
drinkable
and
very
smooth
nice
and
hoppy
650ml
imperial
red
with
more
ridiculous
but
lovely
nonsense
on
the
label
from
lagunitas
nice
to
see
this
a
seasonal
from
a
us
microdoesnt
happen
too
often
up
here
at
the
kensginton
wine
market
popping
the
cap
gives
a
wafting
aroma
of
rubber
and
brown
sugar
the
beers
colour
is
in
between
ruby
and
light
orangishred
actually
the
hue
itself
is
somewhat
hard
to
describe
but
i
like
it
possibly
a
very
dark
rusty
water
or
cola
with
red

colouring
the

is
longlived

compact

well
exquisite
appearance
though
interestingly
a
little
browner
than
other
reds
i
have
sampled
aromanow
this
is
what
i
was
looking
for
this
week
after
the
maximus
last
night
and
rogues
dipa
this
beers
maltier
but
still
hopfilled
smell
is
a
welcome
guest
to
the
nose
what
i
like
about
the
aroma
is
how
it
makes
you
continually
sniff
in
order
to
find
if
the
hops
or
the
malts
are
dominant
whats
the
word
oh
yeah
balance
wonderful
complementing
of
the
thick
barley
notes
with
spicy
wild
citrus
hops
the
malting
makes
the
first
impression
burnt
and
almost
barleywine
sweet
phenolic
solventlike
piquant
with
notes
of
licorice
and
horehound
almost
medicinal
the
sugar
is
all
here
too
like
bubble
gum
and
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
wafer
i
also
get
some
faint
strawberry
and
a
little
lemon
now
thrust
your
nose
deeper
into
the
glass
and
get
your
dose
of
some
earthy
treebark
hoppiness
perhaps
a
little
hard
to
find
at
first
but
once
they
come
out
it
really
shows
off
how
wellhopped
the
beer
really
is
just
enough
the
beers
nose
is
fantastic
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
starting
with
fairly
basic
but
tasty
roasted
gristiness
the
beer
is
a
little
weak
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
actually
but
the
middle
and
finish
make
up
for
it
with
a
wonderful
rush
of
soft
but
bitter
hopping
and
leaving
the
mouth
with
lipsmacking
sweetness
with
the
floral
hopping
adding
some
sweet
perfume
flavours
again
balance
is
the
name
of
the
game
cinnamon
and
chicory
lactosy
malts
that
bring
tastes
of
buttered
toast
and
peanuts
red
licorice
and
light
brown
sugar
with
some
mollasses
sweet
but
with
enough
hopping
to
satisfy
the
hheads
complex
enough
but
beyond
the
complexity
is
just
the
solidity
of
the
malts
working
with
hops
and
vice
versa
a
medium
carbonation
moderate
bitterness
and
very
little
alcoholic
burn
make
this
an
extremely
drinkable
strong
red
ale
through
balance
lagunitas
just
made
this
beer
work
by
coincidence
or
design
matters
not
this
is
a
flavourful
slaker
of
my
thirst
i
will
be
buying
more
boy
is
this
guy
easy
to
drink
pours
a
pretty
red
color
very
clear
with
tons
of
puffy
head
just
tons
of
it
smell
is
hoppy
and
piney
some
good
maltyness
too
taste
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
hoppy
grassy
earthy
a
bit
of
a
twang
to
it
mouthfeel
is
sudsy
and
light
very
easy
to
drink
these
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
on
tap
at
dees
hoppy
piney
aroma
and
variety
of
hops
in
citrus
taste
that
worked
tasty
spicey
and
fruity
finish
medium
and
good
mouthfeel
good
understated
carbonation
resinworks
drinkable
could
stay
on
it
all
evening
another
winner
from
lagunitas
this
is
a
great
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
fantastic
stuff
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
most
reds
are
either
too
cloyingly
malty
or
too
hopped
up
or
simply
too
bland
and
watery
but
this
bad
boy
is
beautifully
balanced
along
with
its
high
octane
hepped
up
flavour
profile
ill
be
stocking
up
on
more
of
this
a
very
welcome
limited
release
from
lagunitas
never
had
an
imperial
red
before
most
likely
a
highlyhopped
amber
ale
lets
see
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
shimmering
transparent
copper
with
a
thick
clinging
ecru
head
detectable
aromas
of
pine
sap
and
bitter
citrus
pith
confirmation
of
extra
hops
i
imagine
indeed
the
hop
content
of
lagunitas
imperial
red
ale
is
certainly
on
the
high
side
notes
of
grapefruit
rind
and
sweetish
blood
oranges
malt
presence
is
discernible
but
only
just
and
primarily
as
a
carameltoffee
flavor
fighting
for
survival
in
a
sea
of
hop
juice
bitter
piney
finish
chinooks
maybe
sticky
lacing
clumps
around
the
glass
in
a
web
pattern
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
and
smooth
thicker
body
than
most
redamber
ales
but
nothing
too
hefty
in
fact
this
is
quite
drinkable
at
least
for
a
slave
to
the
hop
like
me
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
very
extra
medium
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
provides
a
good
lift
on
the
taste
and
drinkability
of
the
beer
the
beer
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
to
drink
later
this
one
lives
up
to
its
name
pours
a
deep
red
rusty
brown
with
a
thick
twofingered
head
that
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
quite
fragrant
with
piney
hop
aromas
and
earthy
hop
aromas
intermingling
its
quite
a
big
hop
nose
what
youd
expect
from
an
imperial
red
from
cali
tastewise
this
one
starts
off
with
bitter
hops
the
hops
are
briefly
interrupted
by
sweeter
malt
notes
before
the
hops
come
back
in
the
finish
the
flavors
and
body
of
the
beer
are
very
full
and
wellrounded
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
beer
its
only
drawback
is
drinkability
which
is
diminished
by
its
weight
in
the
stomach
which
is
pretty
substantial
that
fact
makes
it
a
beer
that
wouldnt
be
sessionable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
found
it
more
like
an
ipa
or
imperial
ipa
than
a
red
im
still
not
sure
what
the
difference
is
poured
a
deep
copperamber
with
a
well
established
of
white
head
that
took
quite
awhile
to
subside
leaving
a
sheet
of
lace
behind
grapefruit
and
and
other
citrus
fruit
dominate
the
aromas
with
a
lighter
pine
notes
and
caramellightly
roasted
malt
the
hop
profile
is
nice
on
the
palate
but
i
dont
think
there
is
quite
enough
of
malt
base
for
a
red
there
is
a
light
roasted
and
sweet
base
but
not
qite
enough
to
hold
up
to
the
hop
attack
saying
that
it
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
like
the
hopsits
close
to
being
very
top
notch
the
beer
disembarks
the
22ounce
brown
bottle
a
sparkling
burnished
copper
color
with
a
behemothic
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
ever
so
slowly
erodes
leaving
a
thick
and
clinging
sheet
of
lace
to
obfuscate
the
glass
nose
has
a
spicy
hop
floral
aroma
chased
by
the
sweet
malt
citrus
crisp
and
as
clean
as
the
air
after
a
sprint
rain
absolutely
mouthwatering
start
is
lightly
sweet
the
grain
presence
noticeable
the
top
is
light
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
kind
in
its
acidity
the
hops
are
dynamic
in
their
spiciness
making
themselves
known
quickly
and
lasting
to
the
very
end
leaving
a
fresh
tangy
aftertaste
whoa
nellie
this
aint
your
normal
red
ale
and
another
treat
from
those
fine
folks
at
lagunitas
adam
if
it
werent
for
the
bitter
finish
this
beer
would
be
extremely
quaffable
i
had
this
on
tap
on
two
different
ocassions
at
one
of
my
favorite
local
restaurants
a
place
i
pretty
much
go
to
because
of
the
bar
poured
into
a
regular
pint
glass
very
attractive
and
somewhat
translucent
red
color
with
a
rich
white
head
the
first
thoughts
i
had
were
this
tastes
like
an
ipa
and
this
tastes
like
cranberries
and
despite
not
being
a
huge
cranberry
fan
i
was
definitely
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
very
hoppy
sort
of
piney
flavor
to
it
definitely
tasted
like
a
highalcohol
beer
but
in
a
good
way
if
you
like
strong
bitter
ales
andor
ipas
give
this
a
try
striking
red
color
and
creamy
head
give
this
ale
a
complete
package
for
looks
smooth
transition
between
hoppy
start
and
soothing
malt
finish
flavors
in
lock
step
with
ibu
listed
on
label
not
sure
where
this
fits
in
style
other
than
it
has
7
abv
for
an
american
strong
ale
i
would
need
some
grilled
meat
with
a
heavy
sauce
to
stand
up
to
the
hops
in
this
brew
overall
a
happy
hoppy
experience
although
40
ibus
are
a
little
much
for
me
unless
enjoyed
with
a
balancing
meal
this
seems
like
a
perfect
beer
for
the
american
strong
ale
tag
its
not
an
ipa
and
it
has
alot
of
the
qualities
of
a
barleywine
on
a
smaller
scale
whatever
it
is
its
a
pretty
great
beer
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
i
really
like
the
style
that
lagunitas
was
shooting
for
and
i
thought
they
pulled
it
off
very
well
red
body
but
what
were
you
expecting
taste
was
very
interesting
carmel
sweetness
is
present
but
a
lot
of
the
experience
was
the
alcohol
coming
through
made
the
taste
full
and
raw
with
some
grassy
grain
to
boot
i
would
like
to
see
more
in
the
style
of
dra
drinkability
hmm
i
dont
know
maybe
its
just
because
im
damn
full
from
the
dinner
i
had
a
little
while
ago
but
im
not
finding
this
exceptionally
drinkable
goes
pretty
well
with
japanese
rich
harvest
cookies
almondsesamechocolate
flavor
much
more
hops
than
expected
from
an
american
red
ale
thats
why
is
characterized
by
an
american
strong
ale
hop
aroma
is
evident
even
before
the
glass
reaches
the
nose
pine
and
flowery
aromas
swirl
around
a
bready
malty
sweet
smell
tastes
boldly
of
sweet
malts
bready
caramelly
lightly
toasted
and
a
tad
grainy
the
the
hops
more
than
just
bittering
flowery
flavors
herbal
grassy
earthy
and
a
little
dirty
for
extra
measure
the
taste
is
muddled
a
bit
but
certainly
adds
character
to
an
otherwise
unappealing
brew
finishes
dryer
than
expected
from
reds
because
of
the
hop
character
and
alcohols
that
go
largely
forgotten
i
look
forward
to
having
another
ok
the
imperial
red
name
is
kinda
silly
and
they
give
you
no
actual
descrition
on
the
bottle
however
i
buy
everything
lagunitas
puts
out
at
least
once
this
one
is
a
winner
if
you
like
this
try
drakes
ipa
it
is
very
similar
tasting
tasty
but
nothing
i
will
go
ape
looking
for
for
5
a
bomber
it
is
pretty
good
though
if
you
have
it
available
locally
the
alcohol
presence
is
detectable
but
doesnt
overpower
all
of
the
flavor
complexities
of
this
brew
a
unique
take
on
the
style
well
balanced
and
a
good
flavor
profile
my
favorite
lagunitas
offering
to
date
good
stuff
final
thoughts
lagunitas
other
beers
may
have
been
forgettable
this
is
a
smack
outta
the
freakin
ballpark
for
any
selfrespecting
hopadoring
american
it
takes
a
seriously
good
beer
to
get
me
to
write
reviews
like
this
one
these
days
a
pleasant
and
strong
ale
here
that
i
liked
a
lot
hoppy
but
accessible
for
both
hopheads
and
nonhopheads
i
could
almost
say
that
this
is
a
really
mellow
barley
wine
but
the
brewer
says
it
is
an
imperial
red
ale
so
i
guess
that
it
is
drinkability
was
rather
high
really
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
big
step
up
from
all
the
generic
red
ales
out
there
worth
seeking
out
i
am
really
starting
to
like
some
of
lagunitas
offerings
quite
a
bit
this
one
was
especiallly
good
it
beers
a
deep
red
inviting
red
it
has
a
strong
malt
profile
no
doubt
but
has
an
even
stronger
fruity
hop
bite
as
the
previous
reviews
state
it
is
quite
smooth
going
down
which
makes
it
fairly
drinkable
despite
the
fact
that
it
tastes
bigger
than
its
actual
alcohol
content
pours
a
bright
orangered
color
topped
by
a
halfinch
of
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
aroma
of
fresh
floral
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
in
the
background
palate
is
thick
with
both
assertive
floral
hops
and
lightly
sweet
malt
notes
of
pine
and
and
light
fruit
come
through
body
is
nice
and
sturdy
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
that
provides
a
warming
finish
still
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
overall
i
have
to
say
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
medium
mouthfeel
and
an
average
drikability
definitely
a
bomber
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
worth
a
try
this
is
a
beer
for
hop
lovers
it
is
fairly
aggressive
this
beer
is
raw
and
hoppy
and
i
almost
think
that
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
to
amplify
the
hop
character
a
bit
more
malt
might
play
up
the
citrus
notes
a
bit
more
and
soften
the
raw
hoppiness
a
bit
as
it
is
you
will
definitely
want
to
be
a
hop
head
to
enjoy
this
one
luckily
i
can
be
and
am
so
this
is
quite
enjoyable
d
very
much
so
a
good
ale
for
drinking
with
or
without
food
i
saw
this
and
had
to
try
it
it
pours
a
orange
red
color
with
a
huge
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
a
citrusgrapefruit
hop
aroma
the
taste
has
a
very
nice
citrus
start
and
ends
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
mf
is
light
and
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
the
very
bitter
aftertaste
is
a
little
too
bitter
maybe
i
should
age
one
all
in
all
this
is
a
brew
that
you
should
not
pass
up
and
i
will
buy
it
again
cheers
lagunitas
rarely
gets
put
into
the
top
10
lists
on
the
message
boards
nor
does
it
get
a
whole
lot
of
attention
that
it
deserves
thank
you
for
such
a
fine
brew
fresh
crisp
sharp
yummmm
actually
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
an
imperial
anything
as
a
homebrewer
i
appreciate
the
distinct
pronunciation
of
the
malt
and
the
hops
not
much
to
compare
to
except
as
a
version
of
an
iipa
not
as
bitter
as
an
iipa
but
yet
with
more
hop
aroma
a
very
nice
brew
indeed
overall
impression
not
bad
smooth
mouthfeel
leads
to
a
high
drinkability
but
the
bitterness
was
a
bit
much
not
quite
enough
malt
backbone
to
go
with
the
other
flavors
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
there
are
plenty
of
floaties
present
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
roasted
and
crystal
malts
along
with
an
intense
piney
hop
aroma
it
seems
a
bit
warm
but
its
well
hidden
with
the
malts
the
taste
is
great
also
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
flavor
with
a
nice
solid
malt
base
it
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
and
adds
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
i
love
the
hop
character
it
really
makes
the
taste
this
is
a
good
drinker
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
sugary
sweetness
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
last
swigs
essentially
a
red
that
thinks
its
a
2ipa
this
brew
gets
street
cred
for
throwing
the
word
red
into
an
exciting
flavor
poured
into
an
imperial

glass

ill

brew
head
holds
well
with
very
sticky
lacing
prevalent
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
a
potent
leafy

aroma
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
sticky
sweetness
on
the
lips
but
balanced
and
more
so
by
the
potent
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
well
one
of
the
better
imperials
from
lagunitas
nice
to
see
them
not
over
do
the
hops
here
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malt
with
a
surprising
hop
bite
towards
the
end
of
each
sip
a
sweet
carmel
core
comes
through
and
with
a
little
higher
alchohol
content
might
taste
similar
to
a
barleywine
another
tasty
beer
from
lagunitas
the
big
malt
presence
here
with
nice
hops
makes
for
a
great
brew

highest
ibu
brew
out
there
but
the
hops
just
laid
heavy
over
the
malt
body
giving
it
just
enough
exposure
to
tantalize
but
not
enough
to
be
able
to
savor
and
thats
a
shame
because
the
malt
spine
of
the
beer
did
tease
with
some
worthwhile
elements
worthy
of
further
exploration
and
discovery
but
the
hops
and
their
rather
simplistic
bittering
result
just
werent
interesting
enough
to
be
the
headliner
nothing
offensive
here
and
it
is
drinkable
on
the
surface
but
considering
i
can
get
hops
lots
of
places
and
often
with
something
a
bit
more
going
on
in
partnership
id
have
to
say
it
was
enough
of
a
disappointment
that
i
wont
be
dipping
back
into
this
well
unless
it
was
pretty
much
devoid
of
real
competition
drinkability
the
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
would
like
but
it
is
certainly
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
pours
a
mighty
amber
with
orange
highlights
the
head
rises
to
2
inch
thick
proportions
the
smell
is
highly
hoppy
with
subtle
hints
of
nectar
and
nuts
the
taste
has
a
uniques
blend
of
citrus
hops
with
the
dark
burnt
malts
almond
flavor
with
bitter
afterlingings
a
nice
feel
a
great
beer
for
those
twilight
nights
very
nice
this
beer
surprised
me
was
not
expecting
this
quality
but
lagunitas
always
seems
to
pull
through
pours
a
clear
orangeish
brown
in
color
thin
layer
of
head
on
top
spotted
lace
nose
is
both
malts
and
hops
another
offstyle
beer
almost
a
double
ipa
not
quite
sure
taste
is
really
nicely
balanced
with
the
malts
and
hops
at
first
sweet
and
malty
but
then
followed
up
with
a
fairly
potent
hoppy
kick
served
cold
it
reminds
me
of
wintergreen
gum
would
that
be
minty
cant
pick
up
any
of
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
medium
body
but
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
is
that
it
does
not
tire
the
taste
buds
but
has
all
sorts
of
nuances
hops
come
through
strong
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
amber
malts
take
over
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
but
hops
take
over
up
front
and
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
in
comparison
with
the
amount
of
flavor
here
still
its
unique
and
pleasing
well
imperial
red
ale
isnt
red
its
more
of
a
clear
darkish
amber
the
mouthfeel
is
great
theres
enough
maltiness
bitterness
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
brew
is
as
bitter
as
a
wellhopped
ipa
as
malty
as
an
amber
or
red
ale
and
deliciously
smooth
with
a
hearty
yet
subtle
7
6
abv
yum
smooth
and
hugely
malty
with
a
surprisingly
assertive
hop
kick
caramel
malts
swim
around
pungent
hop
oils
which
actually
leave
the
palate
with
an
impression
of
dryness
despite
the
maltysweet
onset
of
the
beer
distinctly
american
without
falling
into
any
of
the
tired
pnw
tricks
if
i
didnt
quite
know
what
an
american
strong
ale
was
before
i
know
now
recommended
i
felt
as
though
i
could
keep
drinking
this
even
as
the
last
went
down
my
throat
without
a
second
thought
appropriately
medium
in
body
and
dry
enough
to
make
a
sessioner
if
not
for
the
slightly
elevated
fuckyouup
factor
the
hops
are
just
as
green
fresh
and
in
your
face
as
last
year
but
theres
a
new
twist
a
clear
fresh
note
of
sweet
pineapple
the
overall
taste
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
last
year
but
a
good
balance
to
the
giant
hop
flavors
not
quite
as
complex
but
still
very
very
tasty
had
on
tap
at
the
sunset
dark
amber
when
served
but
i
still
found
some
cloudiness
to
observe
aroma
is
of
low
rich
malt
topped
with
some
candied
hop
accents
thats
a
killer
combination
mouthfeel
is
medium
its
another
12
as
tastewise
theres
good
malt
upfront
with
the
hops
along
for
the
finish
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
even
at
that
abv
for
me
lagunitas
has
its
hits
and
misses
for
this
one
it
is
most
definitely
a
hit
good
stuff
this
beer
looks
red
as
it
should
with
a
creamy
foamy
head
floating
on
top
i
love
red
ales
for
the
balance
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
great
malt
profile
sweet
and
candy
coated
along
with
some
spicyness
great
hop
profile
lots
of
sprucy
juicy
character
and
some
cascades
i
would
guess
some
lagunitas
beers
ive
noticed
have
an
odd
almost
grainy
mouthfeel
this
one
has
it
but
its
not
as
pronounced
as
i
remember
is
some
others
not
a
big
deal
really
but
i
thought
id
mention
it
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
well
balanced
certainly
my
favorite
lagunitas
brew
to
date
drinkability
pretty
much
as
listed
a
ultra
hopped
up
red
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
or
two
cant
believe
this
thing
only
has
40
ibus
very
tasty
to
say
the
least
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
a
winner
id
like
to
see
them
make
it
a
regular
beer
and
offer
it
in
six
packs
great
stuff
and
very
drinkable
thanks
to
fellow
sd
ba
eyechartbrew
for
the
gratis
loan
of
this
one
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
mighty
nice
gesture
sir
dark
gold
with
a
big
head
this
is
a
hop
paradise
in
the
nose
the
body
is
very
refined
with
a
malty
backbone
to
anchor
the
hop
aggression
i
thought
this
was
a
session
beer
until
i
read
the
abv
like
most
lagunitas
beers
this
big
and
beefy
with
a
good
balance
deep
copper
to
garnet
in
color
very
clear
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
i
was
expecting
malt
up
front
in
the
aromas
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
a
pronounced
hop
flower
character
came
across
this
was
backed
by
a
grapefruitcitrus
note
the
bread
dough
that
lagunitas
yeast
brings
and
finally
a
caramel
character
form
the
malt
the
taste
has
the
same
hopforward
character
more
hop
flower
and
more
of
an
orange
peel
citrus
i
dont
catch
the
yeast
quality
in
the
flavor
the
malt
really
balances
the
hops
well
in
this
beer
i
enjoy
lagunitas
beers
when
they
pour
on
the
hops
i
wish
their
was
more
of
this
character
in
the
standard
ipa
it
has
a
slightly
slick
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
clear
deep
ruddy
bronze
hue
mountainous
dense
whipped
fresh
cream
like
head
yields
dogged
frothy
lace
soft
pine
and
underripe
orange
upfront
in
aroma
with
secondary
hints
of
dark
toffee
and
sweet
biscuit
incipient
in
flavor
is
a
snap
of
medium
lovibond
caramel
sweetness
which
is
promptly
ensued
by
agreeably
sharp
pithlike
hop
bitterness
bitterness
is
aptly
complemented
by
notions
of
tangerine
marmalade
ghostly
spruce
and
mellow
strawberryesque
sweetness
moderate
in
body
with
an
agreeably
airy
and
fluid
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
fleeting
resurgence
of
fruity
sweetness
akin
to
fresh
squeezed
grapefruit
and
caramel
quite
a
tasty
brew
with
a
balanced
flavor
profile
and
superb
drinkability
yet
another
regular
in
my
fridge
has
been
discovered
its
clear
copper
body
has
a
reddish
cast
beneath
its
full
head
of
creamy
ivory
froth
the
head
retention
is
excellent
and
it
leaves
sheets
of
think
lace
draped
about
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
resinous
grassy
pineysprucelike
and
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
nose
over
a
seeminglysweet
and
toffeish
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
creamysmooth
across
the
palate
with
just
a
light
tingle
from
its
moderate
finebubbled
carbonation
hops
return
in
the
flavor
wrapped
in
a
soft
luscious
malt
thats
seductively
sweetish
but
not
quite
sweet
decidedly
caramel
accented
softly
bready
and
even
a
touch
biscuity
yeasty
fruitiness
accents
everything
and
brings
the
citrusy
hop
notes
forward
leaving
the
piney
and
resinous
characteristics
to
help
the
firm
bitterness
balance
things
by
lingering
dryly
in
the
finish
theres
alot
going
on
and
yet
its
incredibly
straightforward
and
balanced
leaving
it
drinkable
to
say
the
least
and
the
alcohol
never
makes
an
appearance
beyond
when
you
go
to
get
up
from
your
seat
and
realize
you
may
have
had
too
much
of
a
good
thing
very
nicely
done
big
bulbous
mushroom
cap
of
head
that
settles
to
a
crenellated
frothing
crystal
clear
red
hue
with
some
mahogany
tints
and
no
action
fair
amount
of
hop
spice
on
nose
some
lemony
malt
floating
around
too
to
taste
nice
red
bite
but
more
so
with
a
light
woody
character
almost
imperceptible
a
thin
coating
of
toasted
sesame
comes
up
for
air
pretty
good
but
for
something
that
is
jacked
up
i
prefer
their
hairy
eyeball
comments
the
label
says
it
best
red
is
a
color
not
a
beer
and
while
the
taste
buds
want
what
the
taste
buds
want
you
still
cant
taste
a
color
this
is
sort
of
a
merry
fuck
you
to
beer
poseurs
everywhwere
which
makes
me
laugh
oh
and
the
beer
more
or
less
kicks
ass
too
great
drinkability
another
fine
limited
release
from
lagunitas
poured
a
beautiful

very
balanced

tofee
notes
as
well
neutral
in

neither
thickish

i
expected

thin

nice
surprise
to
find
this
at
my
local
whole

good
drinkable
offering
from
lagunitas
drinkability

this
was
a
terrificdrinking
ale
thats
as
close
to
a
strong
session
ale
as
youll
find
the
balance
coupled
with
the
smoothness
of
the
flavors
makes
you
want
to
gulp
this
puppy
down
or
is
it
pulp
that
guppy
down
see
im
buzzed
already
great
job
lagunitas
there
is
an
interesting
interplay
actually
more
of
war
here
between
hops
which
are
leaning
citrus
and
a
brown
sugaralcohol
flavour
this
second
element
being
somewhat
reminiscent
of
the
same
brewerys
brown
shugga
i
couldnt
call
this
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
certainly
isnt
well
disguised
but
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
brew
and
is
definitely
worth
the
2
69
i
paid
for
it
definite
session
beer
for
the
pros
i
really
dont
know
what
happened
to
this
beer
it
has
all
the
ingredients
to
have
been
another
good
lagunitas
beerbut
it
just
fell
apart
on
tap
at
rock
n
brews
el
segundo
poured
into
nonic
pint
glass
red
amber
in
color
with
offwhite
head
that
clings
smells
of
passion
fruit
and
booze
tastes
about
the
same
with
good
crisp
pine
and
carbonation
i
miss
this
beer
a
lot
lol
nice
beer
at
a
great
price
when
i
had
it
over
a
year
ago
i
hoped
for
christina
hendricks
on
the
label
rating
a
95100
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
satisfying
esbstyle
ale
highly
sippable
and
savory
in
texture
and
overall
taste
id
buy
this
again
anytime
of
year
however
ill
need
to
try
a
much
fresher
bottle
to
confirm
this
good
real
good
ive
had
this
sitting
around
for
a
while
and
finally
decided
to
crack
it
open
this
red
ale
pours
a
true
red
copper
color
with
a
thick
and
lasting
off
white
head
that
leaves
beautiful
silky
lacing
the
nose
is
a
delicious
blend
of
sweet
malts
west
coast
hops
and
spice
the
body
is
rather
full
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
and
just
the
right
amount
of
sticky
sweetness
it
finishes
rather
dry
for
such
a
malty
ale
the
flavor
is
a
little
different
from
the
nose
with
a
more
pronounced
spicy
peppery
bite
and
an
increased
sweetness
this
is
a
very
good
red
knowing
lagunitas
and
their
love
of
hops
i
want
to
try
this
fresh
to
see
if
there
is
a
more
pronounced
hop
character
this
is
very
good
none
the
less
just
a
tad
sweet
for
what
i
expect
from
the
brewer
o
tasty
big
beer
that
is
well
balanced
big
hop
flavor
up
front
slightly
bitter
easy
drinking
for
how
big
it
is
get
a
hold
of
any
of
their
beers
except
for
the
pils
which
i
think
is
a
wasted
effort
also
try
not
to
drink
too
much
as
in
the
brewery
in
general
it
will
wash
your
palate
away
and
youll
be
hunting
for
a
great
stout
or
porter
to
revive
your
palate
you
will
know
thanks
lagunitas
you
guys
make
great
brews
o
not
a
wow
beer
for
me
but
very
yummy
this
would
be
good
in
the
fall
and
spring
might
be
a
spring
seasonal
not
sure
though
seen
that
this
was
a
lagunitas
beer
so
i
hadto
try
lagunitas
has
become
a
brewery
that
i
have
to
try
everything
i
see
edit
with
no
apparent
date
on
the
bottle
and
after
reading
other
reviews
i
think
this
must
be
a
older
beer
a
complete
break
down
on
the
hop
flavor
i
experienced
leads
me
to
feel
this
way
i
think
i
need
to
give
this
one
another
go
to
be
sure
p
s
theyve
changed
the
malt
bill
to
lighten
things
up
from
earlier
iterations

oz
bottle
overall
i
really
like
this
red
ale
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
drink
this
one
again
i
only
wish
it
wasnt
a
seasonal
overall
this
was
a
very
satisfying
experiance
its
tasty
and
filling
it
isnt
too
drinkable
however
and
i
would
buy
it
again
but
only
when
im
looking
for
that
style
specifically
and
not
as
a
go
to
still
definitely
worth
trying
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
love
the
in
your
nose
hop
profile
that
reminds
me
of
a
dipa
just
when
you
taste
it
you
are
dealing
with
a
different
animal
that
is
more
complex
in
character
i
have
another
one
and
am
tempted
to
drink
it
right
now
but
wont
do
that
until
i
get
another
one
for
my
stash
if
you
like
strong
ipas
that
can
cross
over
into
the
complexity
of
a
stout
this
is
a
beer
you
want
i
am
going
to
grab
a
few
more
while
i
can
would
have
again
worth
trying
if
you
have
a
chance
a
very
nice
interplay
of
malt
sweetness
with
hop
spiciness
and
bitterness
almost
seems
like
there
is
some
rye
in
this
one
subtle
yet
deep
complexity
nice
balance
throughout
excellent
work
in
letting
the
grains
and
hops
shine
while
not
letting
the
high
abv
overdominate
things
a
damn
good
beer
the
mouth
feel
was
smooth
almost
silky
and
had
a
good
red
ale
flavor
lagunitas
always
does
it
right
i
need
more
of
this
beer
one
bottle
shared
with
a
friend
is
not
enough
cheers
o
very
solid
red
ale
with
ipa
characteristics
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
part
of
that
was
expecting
something
more
with
it
being
lagunitas
but
this
just
didnt
hit
the
spot
i
would
not
have
it
again
easily
one
of
the
best
concoctions
to
come
from
lagunitas
the
bottle
caught
my
eye
amongst
the
ever
growing
lineup
of
24
oz
craft
brews
showing
up
around
the
supermarkets
in
california
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
beer
reflected
the
bottle
art
expecting
something
like
an
imperial
red
ipa
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
something
much
more
mild
and
easily
drinkable
amber
with
tonal
red
accents
would
be
better
to
describe
the
mondo
large
red
here
only
slightly
sharp
and
tangy
or
maybe
zesty
characteristics
which
is
surprising
considering
the
abv
overall
i
call
the
taste
unique
and
perhaps
complex
hops
that
will
remind
you
of
a
well
brewed
ipa
rather
than
a
red
a
nicely
palatable
fall
beer
that
pairs
well
with
a
hearty
roast
pork
loin
meal
overall
i
have
to
concur
that
this
is
a
good
value
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
double
bastard
or
the
heavy
seas
big
dipa
i
had
a
couple
days
ago
basically
a
solid
and
cheap
entry
into
the
american
light
barleywine
category
o
bueno
the
toasted
sugars
flavors
of
the
malt
tend
to
take
over
especially
as
it
warms
however
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
keeps
this
one
from
being
completely
one
side
definitely
a
unique
beer
im
a
noob
when
it
comes
to
craft
beer
but
this
was
an
exceptional
beer
for
the
price
even
though
the
abv
is
8
65
its
masked
by
the
flavorful
filler
in
the
beer
itself
fruity
overtonesnot
in
a
bad
wayits
a
delicious
beer
get
it
while
its
hot
the
label
is
pretty
bad
ass
too
not
necessarily
what
i
expect
in
a
red
but
who
cares
this
is
is
really
good
o
while
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
the
imperial
red
its
still
a
great
brew
and
one
of
the
first
id
ever
had
from
this
brewery
when
reading
a
mondo
large
red
ale
i
was
expecting
a
deep
chestnut
boozy
syrupy
unbalanced
beer
i
was
immediately
surprised
however
to
pour
a
nice
amber
beer
with
moderate
red
hues
the
smell
was
familiar
for
a
lagunitas
beer
but
then
gave
way
to
aromas
of
fruit
cake
it
coated
the
pallet
smoothly
and
slowly
building
in
apparent
body
with
mounting
tanginess
and
heat
very
pleasant
for
a
fall
day
such
as
this
its
an
outstanding
beer
on
a
recent
kick
of
hoppy
red
ales
ive
been
enjoying
the
local
varieties
from
lawsons
steves
back
yard
red
ale
maine
beer
company
zoeand
most
notably
and
refined
fiddlehead
ruby
claire
with
an
incredible
nose
and
finish
accomplished
by
dry
hopping
with
simcoe
lucky
13
is
pretty
boringquite
malty
and
overrated
imo
o
this
beer
is
a
dangerous
one
the
abv
doesnt
really
show
and
its
nice
and
smooth
creamy
with
citrus
and
resin
combined
in
a
flattering
spice
profile
to
marry
with
the
rich
toasted
caramel
malts
affordable
and
delicious
a
true
winner
creamy
malts
squelch
out
most
of
the
kilned
notes
applelike
hops
are
rich
with
sweetness
and
floral
tones
not
really
dank
after
all
but
mildly
bitter
behind
sweet
nutty
malt
grains
notes
of
caramel
and
treacle
syrup
that
never
become
too
pronounced
tastes
fresh
with
a
zippy
pep
of
implied
spice
totals
out
with
some
fumage
from
the
almost
9
abv
dangerously
drinkable
in
its
smoothness
warms
the
belly
which
cant
quite
catch
up
to
the
tongues
warning
body
has
some
stickiness
but
retains
a
creamy
nature
that
is
a
big
positive
for
the
feel
carbonation
is
mostly
soft
with
some
collective
sizzle
under
the
lips
nice
beer
not
stereotypically
lagunitas
in
a
good
way
o
not
bad
but
nothing
id
be
in
a
big
hurry
to
repeat
the
lucky
13
alt
is
superior
in
my
opinion
feel
free
to
jab
jab
jab
but
some
suggestions
would
be
greatly
appreciated
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
the
hoppiness
is
well
balanced
off
sweet
malt
which
is
well
balanced
off
noticeable
booziness
with
spicy
hops
behind
it
all
just
a
great
drink
overall
yummy
brew
and
interesting
to
consider
and
ponder
over
a
very
nice
hoppy
amber
the
beer
is
balanced
from
nose
to
taste
to
finish
very
smooth
this
one
is
a
winner
overall
a
nicely
crafted
beer
that
is
very
well
balanced
and
not
to
hoppy
for
those
that
arent
used
to
a
dominant
hop
presence
i
still
prefer
wilco
tango
foxtrot
over
this
brew
but
wont
hesistate
to
pick
this
up
again
o
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
imperial
red
this
is
earthy
and
full
decadent
and
has
plenty
of
hop
goodness
the
balance
is
such
that
the
no
one
characteristic
over
takes
the
others
it
has
a
medium
body
and
drinks
toward
the
heavier
side
because
of
all
the
bread
malty
and
fantastic
with
pungent
hops
and
a
good
bitter
too
very
good
grab
one
overall
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
be
getting
more
soon
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
really
nice
it
definitely
stacks
up
to
the
other
red
ales
out
there
for
the
abv
and
price
its
one
of
the
best
im
glad
to
see
that
at
8
65
they
still
managed
to
pull
off
a
nice
flavor
great
beer
lucky
13
is
a
winner
especially
for
this
price
and
level
of
alcohol
not
that
intoxication
is
the
main
purpose
of
enjoying
a
beer
of
this
caliber
but
when
youre
intending
on
drinking
a
single
bomber
in
an
evening
and
perhaps
on
a
limited
budget
this
may
be
a
factor
for
some
types
ill
drink
this
beer
again
this
is
a
good
beer
especially
considering
the
pricetag
really
well
built
and
balanced
for
the
size
that
it
is
id
definitely
suggest
this
o
a
very
very
good
red
ale
ive
had
a
few
different
red
ales
and
they
are
either
very
boring
or
too
hoppy
this
one
seems
to
find
the
right
balance
of
hop
and
malt
for
the
style
another
win
for
lagunitas
this
is
quite
possibly
my
favorite
red
ale
it
hits
all
of
the
right
marks
and
its
delicious
to
boot
nice
rich
malty
sweetness
that
is
bolstered
by
a
big
wave
of
piney
hoppiness
and
finishes
long
and
smooth
its
a
very
sneaky
abv
as
it
drinks
quite
easily
terrific
to
look
at
with
a
pungent
aroma
a
terrific
beer
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
if
i
was
shopping
for
a
big
red
ale
this
would
be
it
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
see
is
a
tad
more
head
retention
otherwise
stellar
o
this
beer
has
interesting
complexities
in
the
taste
akin
to
a
lighter
version
of
an
american
barleywine
its
a
pleasant
beer
to
sip
d
a
rather
unique
american
amber
red
ale
the
77
ibu
seems
a
bit
understated
as
this
one
is
packed
with
pungent
bitterness
the
mentholyptus
notes
i
pick
up
several
facets
are
a
wee
bit
off
putting
but
also
add
a
rather
unique
character
an
interesting
brew
worth
exploring
but
not
something
i
will
revisit
regularity
a
nice
red
color
in
the
glass
about
a
two
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
basically
all
malt
but
the
body
of
the
beer
showcases
the
hops
the
malt
is
all
but
lost
until
the
finishi
found
a
malty
and
hoppy
aftertaste
with
this
beer
somewhat
dry
finish
kind
of
an
odd
beer
i
think
but
very
good
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
points
of
comparison
with
this
one
it
smells
like
a
pale
ale
hits
like
a
scotch
ale
and
finishes
with
the
bitterness
of
an
ipa
in
any
event
im
not
complaining
sweet
malts
are
there
on
the
front
end
but
dont
overwhelm
the
sweetness
fades
into
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
its
smooth
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
alcohol
content
being
somewhat
of
a
hophead
i
look
for
balance
between
malt
and
hops
in
a
beer
and
this
one
has
it
imo
it
potentially
suits
a
wide
range
of
palates
from
those
who
prefer
sweeter
ambers
to
ipa
enthusiasts
such
as
myself
who
want
to
adventure
away
from
extreme
ibu
once
in
a
while
it
poured
a
deep
copper
amber
with
a
substantial
off
white
head
there
were
sweet
malts
and
a
strong
citrus
and
fruity
hop
on
the
nose
the
initial
taste
was
signature
lagunitas
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
and
i
knew
i
was
going
to
enjoy
this
beer
the
flavor
had
much
more
depth
than
the
initial
hop
love
there
were
notes
of
caramel
and
toasted
grain
malts
underneath
the
tropical
fruit
citrus
and
apricot
hop
flavors
the
taste
profile
was
deep
and
varied
and
took
my
palate
on
a
ride
with
each
sip
the
lucky
13
is
the
best
imperial
red
ale
i
have
had
this
brew
goes
big
in
flavor
power
style
delivery
rich
autumn
color
with
a
gorgeous
orangecream
head
fantastic
mouthfeel
lets
you
experience
all
of
the
malts
fruity
hops
bitters
in
a
delicious
palate
of
flavor
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
seasonal
release
for
may
but
you
can
usually
find
it
until
late
summer
definitely
one
of
lagunitas
most
successful
brews
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
this
brewery
and
in
general
if
you
are
looking
for
a
great
american
take
on
a
red
ale
look
no
further
this
is
a
fantastic
amber
ale
it
has
a
great
malt
character
but
an
even
more
profound
deep
hop
character
the
balance
and
drinkability
here
is
fantastic
and
the
abv
is
no
where
to
be
found
this
is
really
a
good
beer
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
from
an
amazing
brewery
gonna
grab
a
bottle
to
age
o
lagunitas
continues
to
impress
this
is
a
fun
and
unique
take
on
the
amber
ale
ha
a
pint
on
tap
at
rattlesnake
impressed
the
bartender
warned
in
advance
that
it
is
8
5
percent
poured
a
standard
copper
color
with
nice
lacing
the
head
is
what
stood
out
and
it
lingered
for
some
time
i
read
someone
else
who
thought
he
got
a
yea
aroma
from
this
and
after
a
few
drinks
i
get
the
same
not
sure
if
i
like
that
however
it
does
have
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
and
the
malt
and
hoppy
combination
is
well
done
nice
carbonated
taste
and
solid
beer
but
damn
i
am
thinking
of
nestea
right
now
tastefeel
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
my
first
few
sips
but
then
it
just
started
tasting
like
a
red
ale
ought
to
and
it
was
just
pleasantly
sweet
theres
sweetness
on
the
front
on
the
middle
and
almost
equally
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
76
ibus
is
there
on
the
back
hits
your
tongue
with
an
incredibly
creamy
mouthfeel
and
then
your
mouth
just
gets
covered
in
glorious
red
ale
goodness
this
may
be
or
is
really
close
to
the
best
red
ale
that
ive
ever
had
it
has
all
those
sweet
red
flavors
youd
expect
but
theres
a
nice
signature
lagunitas
hopbite
on
the
finish
ive
heard
some
describe
this
beer
as
drying
but
i
dont
often
find
any
beer
as
sweet
as
i
find
this
one
to
be
drying
i
guess
id
only
go
as
far
as
saying
its
semidry
theres
about
9
abv
on
this
and
the
alcohol
basically
doesnt
come
through
at
all
the
aftertaste
has
a
very
slight
warmth
or
trace
of
it
but
i
dont
think
the
average
beer
drinking
would
have
any
idea
that
this
is
clocking
in
at
nearly
9
overall
this
is
a
killer
beer
at
a
killer
price
i
will
certainly
by
one
every
time
i
see
it
it
reminds
me
why
i
love
malty
beers
love
the
malt
mixture
and
the
creaminess
must
try
for
the
big
red
and
malt
lovers
o
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
want
out
of
a
strong
red
ale
absolutely
nailed
it
even
if
its
not
my
first
choice
of
style
this
beer
is
extremely
wellcrafted
im
not
a
big
hophead
and
i
like
the
balance
thats
achieved
here
overall
simply
perfect
like
a
red
velvet
cake
melted
into
your
mouthsmothered
in
hopsand
booze
kissed
by
the
california
sun
overall
solid
beer
the
only
reason
you
shouldnt
try
this
is
if
you
dont
like
a
lot
of
malt
even
then
it
will
get
you
buzzed
on
the
cheap
so
try
it
anyway
c
o
a
very
very
good
beer
ambers
are
not
my
thing
but
this
one
is
great
medium
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
with
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
asked
for
a
second
serving
ive
never
seen
this
in
bottles
but
will
start
looking
for
it
now
highly
recommend
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
about
2
fingers
of
head
the
smell
is
wonderful
hops
are
abundant
and
certainly
some
citrus
notes
being
an
ipa
drinker
i
loved
the
presence
of
hops
the
taste
was
excellent
smooth
with
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
the
taste
leaves
you
craving
more
as
you
drink
it
leaves
a
nice
lacey
finish
around
the
glass
definitely
the
best
amber
ale
that
i
have
had
its
actually
going
down
a
little
too
smoothly
overall
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
well
done
this
may
become
one
of
my
favorite
red
ales
the
pour
from
the
bottle
to
the
pint
glass
showed
a
wonderful
deep
amber
brew
with
a
glorious
tan
head
which
left
nice
lace
in
its
wake
aroma
was
hops
dominated
with
some
alcohol
in
the
background
which
is
what
lagunitas
smells
like
taste
again
was
hops
forward
that
lingered
for
a
bit
on
the
tongue
the
malt
stepped
up
right
after
that
for
a
nice
finish
that
left
the
mouth
clean
and
without
hop
bitter
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
after
the
hops
flair
smooth
and
well
rounded
overall
its
a
good
brew
but
the
hop
smack
reminds
me
of
most
of
the
lagunitas
offerings
not
a
bad
thing
really
but
i
wouldve
liked
a
tad
more
malts
and
sugars
peeking
out
instead
great
price
for
a
bomber
and
i
try
any
beer
at
least
once
at
4
50
a
bomber
how
can
you
say
no
the
crispness
is
light
but
consistent
and
solid
allowing
for
a
nice
flowing
smoothness
to
reign
in
the
feel
throughout
a
medium
body
o
pretty
good
imperial
red
recommended
if
you
like
the
style
would
drink
again
o
lucky
13s
savory
rich
and
intense
character
is
unique
among
red
ales
most
red
ales
ive
had
straddle
between
a
lager
and
an
actual
red
ale
yeah
youre
gonna
get
knocked
the
eff
out
by
this
brew
high
alcohol
content
generous
amount
of
high
quality
ingredients
how
have
i
not
found
this
brew
sooner
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
lagunitas
brewing
co
is
one
that
has
never
let
me
down
with
all
of
their
beers
they
have
a
knack
for
brewing
and
do
it
well
keep
it
up
guys
overall
another
fantastic
offering
from
lagunitas
my
current
favorite
amber
very
reminiscent
of
troegs
nugget
nectar
but
a
little
sweeter
the
abv
is
very
wellhidden
affordable
and
delicious
wish
i
had
a
case
a
superb
red
ale
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
the
style
a
masterfully
crafted
brew
with
its
intriguing
complexity
and
yet
beautiful
simplicity
as
all
you
taste
in
the
end
is
malt
and
hops
just
phenomenal
ive
been
locked
into
ipas
for
some
time
now
but
this
was
a
much
enjoyed
departure
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
these
down
the
road
o
a
really
and
good
unique
beer
o
all
in
all
a
wonderful
beer
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
for
sure
o
chase
the
white
whales
if
you
wish
lagunitas
and
stone
make
world
class
brews
for
the
everyman
and
they
are
killing
it
get
some
joker
the
smell
merely
hints
at
the
taste
which
echoes
offering
a
bold
blend
of
pine
and
hops
with
oak
and
caramel
malts
leading
to
a
creamy
warming
finish
the
bubbles
from
the
ample
carbonation
adds
to
the
creamy
mouthful
one
gets
lagunitas
has
proven
to
be
an
outstanding
california
brewer
and
this
one
is
one
of
their
best
offerings
that
i
have
tried
so
far
overall
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
recommended
i
enjoyed
this
one
so
much
that
i
went
and
picked
up
another
five
bottles
of
it
this
morning
lest
they
all
be
sold
out
in
the
imminent
future
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
doesnt
sit
unattended
on
the
shelves
for
all
that
long
and
its
no
wonder
why
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
probably
my
favorite
lagunitas
thus
far
in
the
end
i
wish
this
had
more
hop
bite
and
bitterness
its
super
drinkable
at
8
9
abv
and
tasty
but
a
bit
tame
on
the
aroma
and
flavor
for
me
overall
this
tastes
like
a
classic
lagunitas
this
is
problably
my
favorite
lagunitas
and
my
favorite
red
ale
thus
far
it
is
very
well
balanced
i
get
both
an
explosion
in
hop
character
and
sweet
fruits
in
my
palate
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
a
great
beer
from
lagunitas
easily
one
of
their
better
ones
is
it
just
me
or
do
a
lot
of
their
beers
taste
really
similar
they
seem
to
all
have
the
same
sugary
sweetness
this
one
may
take
the
cake
though
it
has
the
sweetness
of
undercover

with

to
back
it
up
d
really
fantastic
stuff
here
glad
i
got
this
pretty
fresh
or
at

it
sure
does
taste
that
way

no

for
the

i

i
paid

is
beyond
worth
it

well
done
overall
i
wouldnt

anything
less
from

a
very
tasty
beer
either
on
its
own
or
with
food
preferably
greasy
or
fried
not
my
favorite
but
ive
definitely
had
many
much
worse
overall
not
too
surprising
but
another
good
ipa
by
lagunitas
a
little
more
accentuated
on
the
hops
then
some
other
of
their
brews
and
a
little
less
balanced
but
very
tasty
and
enjoyable

lagunitas
seems
to
consistently
come
through
with
great

this
is
no

normal
expect
aggressive

flavors
in
the
west

happy

great

are
just
more

has
a

incredible

the
aroma
is
typical
dank
lagunitas
perhaps
with
some
more
caramel
and
spicy
tones
than
others
in
the
lineup
the
taste
is
fantastic
a
fantastic
resinous
earthy
and
piney
hop
integrates
perfectly
with
a
big
caramel
malt
base
this
is
seriously
a
good
tasty
beer
and
much
better
than
the
alt
version
overall
this
is
very
similar
to
their
imperial
red
ale
in
fact
i
copied
my
review
and
changed
a
few
words
however
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
little
bigger
and
sweeter
and
ultimately
not
quite
as
good
but
still
very
good
overall
this
is
a
pretty
powerful
beer
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
and
i
presume
a
relatively
high
gravity
might
be
fun
to
get
this
in
6packs
but
one
bomber
is
enough
for
me
they
hit
it
for
a
big
red
ale
o
very
impressed
by
this
mondo
large
red
beer
only
second
beer
ive
had
from
lagunitas
but
im
fast
becoming
a
fan
will
definitely
drink
again
because
its
not
expensive
4
99
and
very
good
the
flavor
has
a
tangy
synergy
of
yeast
and
hops
with
tropical
taste
of
grapefruit
and
mango
with
some
light
vegetal
elements
leading
me
to
believe
this
was
dryhopped
there
is
an
orange
rind
element
in
the
taste
which
brings
a
zesty
overall
taste
with
some
sweetness
in
the
malt
support
and
alcohol
boost
the
hops
have
a
nice
flavor
and
slight
grassiness
but
still
seems
to
blend
well
with
the
yeast
flavor
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
value
very
juicy
hop
flavor
and
the
only
drawback
to
have
multiples
is
the
elevated
alcohol
level
o
a
pleasant
beer
however
it
wasnt
as
hop
forward
as
i
thought
it
would
be
still
very
tasty
and
cheap
o
its
a
big
beautiful
and
hoppy
red
ale
it
tastes
good
is
priced
well
and
is
very
inoffensive
and
well
made
if
you
like
hoppy
beer
its
everything
id
expect
from
a
lagunitas
beer
o
its
hard
to
call
this
a
malt
bomb
because
its
so
balanced
this
is
a
really
good
beer
if
youre
like
me
and
feel
that
most
american
strong
ales
are
a
bit
of
an
unbalanced
tastebud
assault
give
this
a
try
very
good
though
i
expected
more
malt
from
a
red
beer
the
hops
was
unexpected
but
enjoyed
i
love
grapefruit
o
a
little
above
average
and
certainly
not
disappointing
for
its
price
but
not
what
i
remembered
it
being
from
last
year
this
year
it
does
seem
to
be
much
more
the
amber
it
advertises
than
the
dipa
it
seemed
like
in
memory
still
tons
of
hop
as
the
77
ibus
can
attest
probably
not
seeking
out
more
of
this
but
not
unhappy
to
be
drinking
it
overall
another
lagunitas
beer
another
sweet
red
grapefruit
bomb
i
realize
this
is
their
signature
hop
profile
and
i
do
love
it
but
do
we
really
need
a
dozen
beers
that
all
taste
nearly
identical
but
hey
if
it
aint
broke
dont
fix
it
right
nickelback
and
linkin
park
release
the
same
formulated
songs
time
and
time
again
and
theyre
successful
right
ahh
i
digress
this
is
good
but
if
youve
never
had
this
before
dont
expect
much
of
a
difference
from
their
other
releases
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
lagunitas
and
its
very
nice
to
reacquaint
myself
with
lucky
13
o
a
very
nice
red
as
an
ipa
fan
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
their
censored
copper
ale
as
it
has
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
enjoyable
in
its
own
right
but
also
might
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
into
greater
hops
of
an
ipa
o
610
nothing
special
from
lagunitas
its
like
drinking
another
one
of
their
session
beers
its
always
a
poor
level
of
balance
from
these
brewers
im
not
impressed
i
sure
will
be
buying
these
22s
because
i
get
them
for
3
99
but
it
is
only
because
i
enjoy
their
style
of
beer
lucky
13
may
only
be
for
the
beer
advocates
but
it
sure
doesnt
live
up
to
the
bjcp
style
guidelines
overall
just
a
solid
impressive
great
tasting
and
real
easy
drinking
amber
ale
overall
great
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
when
waldo
runs
out
beautiful
pour
color
aroma
and
head
are
all
delicious
even
before
introducing
this
beer
to
the
palate
once
introduced
this
beer
yields
an
initial
sweetness
that
soon
builds
into
strong
yet
manageable
hop
characteristics
finishes
semisweet
this
beer
circles
the
palate
and
ends
very
nicely
complex
yet
very
drinkable
a
o
excellent
with
great
balance
and
wellhidden
alcohol
similar
to
lagunitas
imperial
red
ale
i
think
which
id
love
to
have
available
in
a
simultaneous
tasting
o
a
damn
tasty
anniversary
ale
cheers
to
lagunitas
on
another
amazing
brew
and
many
more
the
mouth
is
thick
oily
and
has
midlevel
carbonation
this
is
nice
beer
from
a
brewery
that
continues
to
impress
happy
anniversary
and
i
hope
you
have
many
more
as
i
worked
through
this
bottle
i
became
less
enchanted
by
its
flavors
its
not
as
enjoyable
as
it
could
be
good
but
certainly
not
great
and
even
good
was
pushing
it
at
the
end
great
start
but
it
really
faded
down
the
line
killer
beer
in
that
over
the
top
but
balanced
style
that
lagunitas
owns
i
thought
this
was
a
dipa
due
to
the
huge
hops
and
big
piny
finish
i
loved
the
mouthfeel
as
it
was
huge
yet
velvet
smooth
no
rough
edges
yet
complexity
from
every
sip
i
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
as
the
bc
government
stores
stockpiled
it
at
6
35
each
overall
i
am
buying
more
anyone
can
drink

pours
a

color
there
is
a
discernable
peach
tint
as
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
and
waterfalls
into
the
glass
a
foamy
off
white
head
appears
and
lingers
but
for
no
longer
than
the
average
ale
there
is
a
wonderful
rich
aroma
of
butterscotch
offset
by
sweet
citrus
creamy
mouthfeel
that
almost
seems
misplaced
a
mild
scrubbing
appears
on
the
rear
of
the
tongue
likely
due
more
to
hop
heat
than
carbonation
as
the
beer
finishes
the
flavors
are
complex
not
necessarily
complimentary
but
interesting
sweet
bold
malt
brings
an
undeniable
vibrant
toffee
flavor
followed
immediately
by
some
pretty
obtrusive
hop
resin
this
is
a
pretty
large
effort
on
the
part
of
lagunitas
for
number
13
i
like
it
because
it
is
irreverent
and
disrespectful
but
quite
good
final
thought
why
is
everything
lagunitas
makes
that
is
seasonal
so
awesome
thank
you
again
lagunitas
for
always
making
a
top
shelf
product
very
nice
flavor
on
this
beverage
very
strong
in
its
price
range
maybe
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
imo
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
o
a
great
anniversary
present
to
us
all
i
can
really
appreciate
an
ale
that
is
hoppy
and
a
little
sweet
all
at
the
same
time
overall
it
feels
like
a
bit
of
false
advertising
to
call
this
an
amberred
but
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
in
a
minute
im
pleasantly
surprised
picked
this
up
in
buffalo
pours
a
clear
orangegolden
colour
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
smells
very
hoppy
and
citrus
like
tastes
more
of
tropical
fruits
mixed
with
a
citrus
hoppy
finish
the
8
9
alcohol
is
well
hidden
on
this
and
it
makes
for
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
this
brewery
keeps
pumping
out
quality
beers
enjoyable
beer
citrus
and
pine
flavors
cut
the
occasionally
overly
sweet
red
feeling
of
this
beer
not
something
i
would
session
but
a
pleasing
one
off
overall
i
love
this
it
was
very
hard
not
to
give
it
a
5
and
if
i
continue
to
fall
in
love
with
this
brew
i
may
revisit
this
review
and
upgrade
it
if
you
have
never
had
it
get
it
overall
quite
nice
for
such
a
heavy
beer
i
could
see
buying
this
one
again
surprised
that
its
so
light
up
there
with
some
of
my
favorite
reds
ie
nugget
nector
great
example
of
style
most
reds
seemed
to
be
under
malted
over
hopped
brown
ales
a
bit
too
strong
to
have
high
drinkability
but
taste
great
and
its
great
for
sipping
and
enjoying
love
it
double
amber
or
double
ipa
either
way
you
must
pick
this
up
overall
fantastic
should
be
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
red
ale
o
i
love
this
beer
its
always
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
summer
pick
it
up
if
this
were
listed
as
an
ipadipa
it
would
likely
make
by
top
10
well
at
least
my
top
20
this
is
excellent
stuff
o
damn
this
was
good
the
more
i
drink
of
lagunitas
the
more
this
brewery
impresses
me
i
wish
i
had
more
than
1
bottle
this
is
top
notch
and
i
highly
recommend
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
winner
but
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
its
sipping
beer
not
a
session
beer
as
are
many
other
amber
ales
its
perhaps
a
little
more
hoppy
than
a
typical
amber
ale
but
that
is
a
positive
distinguishing
characteristic
the
beer
has
a
decent
price
to
value
tradeoff
and
id
definitely
buy
it
again
o
what
an
enjoyable
beer
i
really
didnt
see
this
one
coming
even
with
the
ratings
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
for
sure
o
first
and
foremost
i
am
not
a
malt
bomb
kinda
dude
but
this
takes
the
cake
on
that
concept
massive
flavor
all
over
with
a
caramel
malt
taste
that
dominates
lagunitas
you
continue
to
be
one
of
the
best
breweries
out
there
o
very
nice
amber
ale
i
have
been
holding
on
to
this
for
a
few
months
so
it
is
not
as
fresh
as
it
maybe
should
be
but
either
way
another
very
solid
offering
from
a
great
brewery
t
slightly
sweet
red
fruit
and
plum
malts
up
front
are
quickly
balanced
by
grape
skinpine
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
sweetbitter
axis
is
well
balanced
vacillating
between
brief
mirages
that
its
leans
sweet
or
bitter
at
any
moment
pleasantly
over
the
top
notes
of
candied
juicy
raspstrawberry
lime
brown
sugar
toasted
earth
and
kumquat
pinecitrus
bitterness
is
somewhat
pithy
and
rough
especially
in
the
finish
finish
has
notes
of
pine
green
herbs
and
is
quite
dry
lingers
tacky
and
thick
on
the
tongue
overall
i
liked
very
much
a
very
good
brew
from
a
fantastic
brewery
worthy
of
buying
again
overall
this
red
ale
caught
me
by
surprise
i
basically
picked
it
up
off
a
friends
dare
ive
had
lagunitas
wtf
before
while
it
was
good
this
is
a
better
offering
in
my
opinion
im
slightly
partial
to
ipared
ales
though
the
price
was
decent
for
the
size
too
would
definitely
buy
more
if
it
was
more
known
in
my
area
an
excellent
beer
by
lagunitas
made
better
by
the
fact
that
i
found
it
on
draft
and
brought
a
growler
home
served
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
that
settled
out
after
a
bit
and
plenty
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
dark
amber
aroma
is
on
the
mild
side
malt
hop
caramel
flavor
has
a
lot
more
going
on
similar
to
nose
plus
roast
nutmeats
toffee
leather
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
for
style
finish
is
like
flavor
tapers
off
nicely
and
stays
true
good
drinking
beer
yessir
od
an
interesting
but
not
particularly
easy
to
drink
beer
the
heft
sits
on
stomach
pretty
hard
the
west
coast
hopping
starts
to
leave
a
pretty
harsh
bitterness
abv
is
high
enough
to
get
you
o
yuck
total
maltbomb
no
balance
i
hadnt
met
a
lagunitas
beer
i
didnt
like
until
now
o
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
it
really
blurs
the
lines
between
amber
red
and
ipa
the
alcohol
is
completely
masked
and
i
could
see
this
being
quite
a
dangerous
brew
if
you
had
more
than
1
on
hand
its
a
bit
overblown
and
not
what
i
would
expect
from
the
listed
style
of
amberred
ale
not
sure
what
to
think
here
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
overall
tasty
and
real
smooth
more
so
then
i
expected
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
enjoy
slighty
more
hoppy
then
the
average
red
ale
which
aint
a
bad
thing
worth
a
drink
for
sure
overall
i
am
continually
blown
away
by
lagunitas
and
this
is
no
exception
the
8
9
abv
is
perfectly
hidden
the
progression
of
flavors
is
so
nice
nice
complexity
and
full
flavored
what
a
nice
ale
highly
recommend
will
definitely
purchase
this
whenever
it
is
available
o
my
favorite
beer
so
far
of
2011
and
ive
had
a
lot
one
of
my
favorite
releases
from
lagunitas
and
on
taste
alone
its
1
its
not
a
perfect
5
0
as
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
coppery
aftertaste
when
it
leaves
the
mouth
but
with
an
abv
of
8
9
thats
to
be
expected
and
shouldnt
be
held
against
it
too
much
very
nice
release
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
very
nice
copper
color
and
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
aroma
was
a
precursor
to
the
unexpected
hoppiness
i
am
a
hop
head
but
the
mega
pine
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
seemed
unwelcome
i
expected
this
to
be
better
i
did
like
the
splash
of
plumfruit
flavor
in
the
middle
but
i
guess
what
im
trying
to
say
is
that
theres
too
much
going
on
in
a
bad
way
in
this
particular
one
very
boozy
i
dont
understand
the
reviewers
who
feel
that
its
balanced
this
is
my
first
lagunitas
offering
and
i
def
want
to
give
them
another
try
though
o
a
very
good
beer
i
actually
like
it
a
lot
its
got
the
best
of
both
worlds
tastes
like
a
red
from
the
get
but
then
transitions
into
a
flavoer
like
an
ipa
good
stuff
lagunitas
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brownish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
and
citrus
taste
is
piney
hops
up
front
some
citrus
and
malts
considerable
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
brew
this
is
one
to
sip
which
gives
one
time
to
think
of
all
that
lagunitas
has
done
in
its
13
years
right
up
front
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
lagunitas
brews
so
there
might
be
some
builtin
bias
to
this
review
with
that
said
i
have
to
say
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
hoppiness
of
this
beer
totally
wasnt
expecting
it
ill
likely
buy
a
couple
more
bombers
to
squirrel
away
and
enjoy
another
day
o
its
a
malt
strong
dipa
which
describes
approximately
90
of
lagunitass
offerings
future
outlook
another
winner
for
lagunitas
and
a
relative
bomber
bargain
4
99
will
have
to
nab
a
few
more
of
these
o
well
balanced
flavors
for
an
amber
ale
with
this
amount
of
alcohol
content
more
on
the
hoppy
side
which
is
great
for
you
hopheads
o
very
good
a
good
diversion
from
hop
stoopid
but
still
in
the
same
ballpark
except
a
bit
more
belgiany
throughout
might
be
tough
to
finish
a
whole
bottle
alone
though
due
to
the
sweetness
creeping
check
out
the
alt
version
of
this
one
too
drinkability
a
good
red
ale
but
not
completely
to
style
very
pleasant
drinking
tho
overall
i
really
like
the
balancing
act
this
beer
pulls
off
solid
bitterness
along
with
a
complex
flavor
thanks
to
sweetwillyrolbar
for
this
awesome
bottle
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
poured
vigorously
this
yields
a
two
fingers
width
crown
with
a
sea
of
beautiful
reddishamber
beneath
this
has
a
pretty
sweet
malt
forward
nose
some
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
buried
amid
the
other
scents
the
taste
is
really
sublime
wheres
this
one
been
all
my
life
i
could
definitely
make
a
habit
out
of
drinking
this
stuff
the
taste
too
is
on
the
malty
side
but
its
not
over
powering
theres
a
hidden
kinda
sweet
fruity
nutty
undertone
to
the
flavor
profile
that
is
very
pleasant
this
one
goes
down
so
easy
all
in
all
i
really
dig
this
beer
chalk
one
up
for
lagunitas
this
is
a
winner
a
good
amber
dipa
cheers
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
and
plan
on
buying
enough
to
last
me
for
a
very
long
time
go
grab
one
yourself
cheers
my
second
of
the
lagunitas
line
hop
stoopid
being
the
first
poured
a
bit
lighter
than
anticipated
with
a
cream
two
finger
head
and
pale
amber
color
sweet
and
hoppy
at
the
front
with
a
nice
raisiny
sweetness
on
the
finish
not
too
thick
either
which
i
like
and
plenty
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
overall
tasty
strong
but
drinkable
brew
copper
fairly
clear
with
a
thin
sticky
head
with
great
cling
restrained
piney
aroma
resinous
hops
some
caramel
sweetness
that
finishes
clean
with
just
a
little
but
not
too
much
lingering
spruce
bitterness
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
the
high
abv
is
very
restrained
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
that
has
some
hazy
red
hues
to
it
it
grows
about
an
inch
of
eggshell
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
a
ring
and
patches
of
bubbles
it
smells
of
citrus
grapefruit
orange
plenty
of
hops
as
is
the
lagunitas
way
some
grass
and
herbs
and
a
nice
malt
base
tastes
similar
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hops
and
citrus
a
caramel
malt
backbone
plays
nicely
throughout
the
drink
and
helps
smooth
out
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
has
a
nice
medium
bodied
mouth
that
finishes
very
well
not
too
dry
or
sticky
wet
overall
a
solid
beer
and
one
that
i
always
look
forward
to
a
good
red
ale
but
the
resiny
sweetness
is
a
little
rough
a
bomber
of
this
may
be
a
bit
too
much
for
me
another
great
beer
bargain
at
4
99
serving
type
bottle
once
again
lagunitas
comes
through
with
a
tasty
boozy
affordable
taste
explosion
keep
rocking
lagunitas
definitely
worth
a
try
highly
recommended
o
usually
i
would
say
that
anything
from
lagunitas
is
amazing
but
this
is
the
first
beer
from
them
that
i
dont
really
care
that
much
for
good
definitely
great
by
no
means
for
6
50
a
bottle
no
complains
though
cheers
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
a
yinyang
of
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
its
too
easy
to
drink
given
its
maskedhigh
alcohol
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
big
hoppy
flavoring
for
a
red
ale
it
is
always
nice
to
see
gratuitous
use
of
hops
while
not
straying
too
far
away
from
the
origins
of
the
beer
the
flavors
here
were
complex
but
yet
well
blended
and
seemingly
simplistic
this
is
another
homerun
for
lagunitas
o
the
flavors
are
great
in
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
red
ale
very
nice
beverage
and
one
that
ill
buy
again
this
is
an
excellent
beer
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
come
across
it
great
red
ale
always
worth
a
try
a
definitive
and
delicious
version
of
the
style
one
of
my
favorite
big
reds
o
this
is
just
personal
preference
here
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
west
coast
imperial
red
ale
i
prefer
a
cake
batter
hop
bomb
eg
green
flash
hop
head
red
but
once
again
thats
just
personal
preference
d
really
a
fantastic
amber
a
great
investment
for
amber
or
red
ale
lovers
overall
im
really
liking
these
hoppy
ambers
and
this
one
is
damn
good
d
definitely
a
great
beer
and
put
in
front
of
me
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
but
it
is
quite
a
strong
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
it
sports
the
lagunitas
trademark
sweet
taste
my
only
complaint
is
that
every
lagunitas
beer
tastes
remarkably
similar
pours
a
reddish
hue
with
a
decent
loose
head
this
one
is
sweet
malty
and
clean
with
enough
alcohol
to
make
an
impact
with
little
carbonation
this
is
a
good
sipper
pretty
decent
o
great
appearance
and
good
taste
the
bitterness
may
be
just
a
little
off
balance
overall
a
strong
malty
red
ale
with
a
robust
hop
profile
to
match
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
recognize
its
merit
and
can
appreciate
it
o
perhaps
the
above
description
doesnt
adequately
demonstrate
my
satisfaction
with
this
brew
i
enjoyed
it
tremendously
what
with
its
bright
hoppy
flavors
and
its
malty
sweetness
a
very
enjoyable
alt
laguinitas
does
a
great
job
on
just
about
everything
they
touch
they
were
at
the
charlottesville
va
brewfest
last
year
and
i
hope
they
bring
something
special
this
year
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
light
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
reddish
hue
and
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
stiff
bright
white
foamy
head
with
excellent
head
retention
foam
left
rows
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
grapefruit
hop
and
sweet
caramel
malt
aromas
are
dominant
with
a
hint
of
pine
hop
as
well
very
crisp
fresh
aroma
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
delicate
smooth
feel
from
beginning
to
end
with
just
a
touch
of
resinous
feel
at
the
finish
nice
balance
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
caramal
malt
flavor
from
beginning
to
end
with
pine
hop
bitterness
flavors
becoming
more
prominent
at
the
finish
finishes
clean
with
a
light
pine
bitterness
this
was
excellent
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
quite
chewy
and
warming
overall
im
enjoying
this
barleywine
wait
i
mean
strong
ale
wait
no
its
an
imperial
red
ahh
style
semantics
it
doesnt
really
matter
in
the
end
because
this
is
one
delicious
beer
o
this
is
a
tasty
offering
from
lagunitas
a
beer
which
runs
the
gamut
from
buttery
caramel
malt
to
citrusy
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
are
skillfully
melded
together
to
create
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
red
ale
i
most
def
enjoyed
this
beer
once
again
wasnt
let
down
cheers
o
drinkable
yes
i
would
have
this
beer
again
i
picked
up
a
22oz
bottle
for
4
50
overallthis
beer
is
phenomenal
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
for
4
bucks
this
would
be
agreat
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
a
iipa
although
its
not
a
iipa
its
hopped
like
some
and
its
very
smooth
maybe
the
best
amber
ive
ever
hadi
havent
had
that
many
highly
reccomended
i
will
take
13
any
day
who
said
its
unlucky
this
beer
is
good
the
lucky
13
is
a
rich
amber
ale
with
ecru
creamy
head
that
is
lacing
beautifully
the
smell
is
a
nice
malt
with
sweet
undertones
the
taste
is
a
pure
full
bodies
red
ale
with
malt
and
sweet
caramel
the
abv
is
high
but
you
cannot
sense
it
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
the
problem
is
i
would
try
to
session
and
destroy
myself
oh
well
overall
a
great
brew
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
bold
and
generous
on
the
palate
a
wrecker
very
good
release
would
purchase
again
overall
a
best
beer
on
ba
i
say
top
3
hop
stoopid
close
behind
this
try
it
d
pretty
pleased
with
this
beer
but
i
really
really
do
like
red
ales
so
i
guess
i
wasnt
taking
much
of
a
risk
here
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
pleasant
on
palate
drinks
nicely
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
this
wasnt
another
overly
boozy
malt
bomb
from
lagunitas
ill
drink
this
again
pours
the
color
of
a
fresh
new
penny
clean
and
clear

and
bitter

with
some
brown
sugary
sweet

taste
is
quite
strong
on
the
grapefruit
some
pine

with
enough
sweet
malt
to
cut
into
the
overall
bitterness
medium
bodied
thinner
feeling
then
the
boldness
of
the
scent
and
taste
dictate
goes
down
clean
and
smooth
would
like
a
touch
of
creaminess
overall
im
a
huge
fan
of
hopped
up
ambers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
though
well
behind
nugget
nectar
in
all
areas
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
about
average
for
the
style
overall
its
a
very
solid
beer
some
great
hoppy
flavors
to
it
and
enough
of
a
malty
presence
to
keep
things
interesting
very
enjoyable

color
with
a

is
more
of
the
same
nice
hoppy
flavor
with
a
dry
piney
finish
tropical
fruits
as
well
pineapple
is
most
prevelant
dangerously
drinkable
awesome
hoppy
red
ale
has
some
of
that
signature
hoppy
lagunitas
taste
overall
worth
seeking
out
o
i
loved
this
beer
although
i
may
have
a
bit
of
a
bias
for
supercharged
amber
ales
and
this
one
is
no
different
delicious
lucky

not
for
me
o
note
a
bad
brew
at
all
worth
picking
up
if
youre
a
fan
of
lagunitas

i
cant
find
any
bottling
dates
on
this
one
but
i
suspect
that
this
bottle
isnt
the
freshest
example
of
this
beer
even
though
i
purchased
this
today
at
a
somewhat
reputable
store
that
being
said
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
but
as
is
this
is
still
a
damn
tasty
brew
lagunitas
im
starting
to
really
dig
ya
o
its
a
nice
hoppy
amber
close
to
great
lucky
13
alt
bottle
from
madison

exchange
opened

this
new
edition
is
encouraging
lagunitas
i
like
your
style
its
nose
holds
hop
citrusy
pine
grilled
orange
and
buttery
mouthfeel
once
beer
settles
is
thick
smooth
certainly
grab
a
bottle
before
its
gone
and
judge
it
with
your
own
personal
touch
93points
this
is
a
very
fine
tasting
and
feeling
beverage
the
look
is
average
and
the
aroma
is
run
of
the
mill
that
being
said
i
would
still
certainly
recommend
this
to
a
friend
o
a
fine
imperialized
red
o
lucky
13
isnt
even
close
to
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
lagunitas
its
not
bad
but
the
overdose
of
alcohol
on
the
palate
really
hurts
this
one
if
theyd
tweak
it
a
bit
here
and
there
this
could
be
a
really
killer
bottle
of
beer
in
the
meantime
id
look
elsewhere
to
get
your
amber
fix
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazed
copper
coloring
with
a
chunky
light
fluffy
cream
colored
head
nose
is
slightly
sour
malt
mild
hops
and
peppery
spices
the
aromas
are
similar
to
a
lot
of
dipas
the
beer
is
round
and
robust
in
mouth
with
the
malt
carrying
most
of
the
load
and
the
spices
picking
up
the
tail
end
spiced
flavors
include
pepper
and
cardamom
the
beer
has
a
semisweet
aftertaste
with
a
slight
citrus
hint
at
the
very
end
the
finish
is
semisweet
also
with
a
slight
sour
balance
flavors
also
remind
me
of
some
dipas
beer
leaves
a
great
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
while
you
drink
solid
brew
do
while
comparisons
of
this
beer
to
lagunitas
wilco
tango
foxtrot
may
be
appropriate
the
lucky
13
is
the
maltier
of
the
twoseeming
unbalanced
in
that
direction
despite
the
detectable
hop
influences
it
is
extreme
for
the
style
considering
the
unusual
sensory
qualities
and
would
make
an
interesting
player
in
a
malthops
contrast
to
stone
arrogant
bastard
the
aggressively
malty
backbone
encourages
pairing
with
zesty
savory
food
especially
tomatobased
sauces
or
soups
the
taste
is
equally
complex
with
an
explosion
of
deep
toasty
malt
full
of
dried
fig
raisin
brown
sugar
and
pungent
white
pepper
finishes
with
a
lingering
hops
bitterness
to
complement
the
sweet
malts
pours
a
reddishbrown
has
a
thick
beigecolored
head
i
thought
it
was
hoppier
than
other
reviewers
noted
i
got
an
upfront
bitterness
almost
a
pinelike
hop
taste
as
with
sn
torpedo
taste
is
big
bold
flavors
of
dark
fruit
slight
caramel
hops
alchohol
is
noticeable
at
8
56
abv
it
isnt
very
drinkable
for
me
because
of
the
higher
abv
but
it
is
a
good
beer
the
bottle
i
tried
was
perhaps
a
year
old
anyways
so
a
fresher
one
would
probably
taste
better
overall
i
like
this
beer
in
the
aspect
of
drinkability
and
alcohol
content
excellent
beer
for
session
and
daily
i
imagine
this
probably
had
a
little
bit
more
hop
zing
to
it
when
it
was
fresh
ive
been
meaning
to
crack
this
for
like
6
months
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
delicious
and
pretty
damn
awesome
surprise
surprise
another
awesome
beer
from
lagunitas
t
very
complex
flavor
its
like
a
mean
bitter
barleywine
do
i
detect
tickling
the
umami
part
of
our
taste
buds
its
surely
not
out
to
please
everyone
but
those
looking
for
a
dark
complex
beerits
yours
tried
this
outstanding
beer
with
my
good
ba
beer
drinking
buddy
arithmeticus
the
beer
surprisingly
was
a
dark
red
yes
that
was
sarcasm
with
a
moderate
head
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
reminded
me
of
a
barleywine
with
cocoa
overtones
the
taste
was
extremely
complex
it
tasted
like
a
cross
between
an
englishstyle
barleywine
and
a
porter
but
had
a
lingering
hoppy
finish
it
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
ta
boot
would
i
have
it
again
absolutely
o
not
bad
but
id
probably
not
track
this
down
seems
a
little
one
sided
with
hops
but
i
think
i
should
have
warmed
this
up
a
bit
before
drinking
im
into
it
but
its
a
bit
too
intense
to
want
to
drink
much
of
coats
well
enough
and
the
mouthfeel
is
on
point
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
felt
it
reached
out
across
several
different
styles
and
aims
to
be
a
crowd
pleaser
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
1
inch
bone
color
head
that
fades
to
a
residue
on
the
top
of
the
beer
good
ring
lacing
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
grapefruit
caramel
plums
a
very
good
smelling
beer
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malt
grapefruit
brown
sugar
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
somewhat
creamy
hop
coating
is
mild
in
the
mouth
i
usually
dont
like
amberred
ales
but
this
is
super
good
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
notes
this
big
red
ale
doesnt
disappoint
there
is
plenty
of
hop
and
malt
complexities
to
satisfy
both
hop
heads
and
malt
lovers
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
have
easily
finished
this
bomber
by
itself
enjoyable
beer
not
surprisingly
this
remains
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
beers
md
medium
bodied
leaves
my
mouth
very
dry
i
expected
it
to
be
hoppier
but
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
find
that
this
style
can
range
in
the
amount
of
hops
used
and
this
one
is
on
the
lower
end
but
is
very
nice
nonetheless
deservedly
one
of
the
top
examples
in
the
style
lagunitas
have
continued
to
demonstrate
that
they
represent
amazing
bang
for
your
buck
and
id
be
pleased
to
buy
this
one
again
surprisingly
very
smooth
with
a
light
creamy
taste
at
the
end
sour
notes
linger
but
not
to
intense
as
the
alcohol
tames
the
ibus
excellent
in
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
you
will
never
tire
out
with
this
one
overall
pretty
much
loved
it
d
very
high
for
an
imperial
red
my
two
glasses
from
the
bomber
went
down
quickly
and
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
another
great
value
too
always
a
plus
this
bottle
is
one
that
i
had
after
the
chiefs
lost
theyre
playoff
game
poured
a
nice
amber
deep
red
color
and
had
a
great
thick
appearance
the
smell
is
amazing
and
brings
up
alot
of
hops
and
citrus
fruit
grapefruit
and
lemon
the
mouth
is
full
and
a
medium
thick
full
and
goes
down
easy
for
a
beer
that
is
over
8
abv
this
is
a
good
bee
for
a
red
ale
and
would
recommend
this
to
someone
looking
for
a
good
ale
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
imperial
series
glass
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
red
with
very
little
head
its
got
a
very
distinct
and
hoppy
smell
to
it
warms
me
up
with
every
sniff
the
taste
is
of
caramelized
hops
and
sweet
sugar
swirling
around
it
leaves
the
mouth
dry
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
reminds
you
its
there
after
every
sip
not
a
bad
thing
definitely
a
classy
beer
but
then
lagunitas
never
really
misses
drinkability
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
while
the
aromas
and
flavours
seem
a
little
bland
it
is
still
enjoyable
d
the
hops
were
a
bit
much
but
this
made
for
a
fine
sipping
beer
definitely
not
one
i
could
session
i
found
this
to
to
a
rich
flavorful
and
malty
brew
also
packing
a
larger
then
usual
hop
package
typical
for
the
lagunitas
offerings
loaded
with
flavor
malts
and
crunching
hops
well
crafted
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
stuff
me
like
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
this
certainly
lives
up
to
the
mondo
large
on
the
label
this
is
a
big
beer
with
plenty
of
taste
that
should
keep
you
interested
throughout
a
night
of
drinking
pours
a
coppercrimson
color
easily
a
2finger
head
reduces
to
frothy
thin
film
very
sticky
lacing
covers
90
of
the
glass
aroma
of
very
earthy
pine
hops
and
such
a
creamy
sweet
malt
much
like
vanilla
followup
aromas
of
pecans
giving
this
beer
a
phenomenal
malt
character
taste
starts
off
with
wellbalanced
hops
that
dont
overpower
followed
by
malts
that
are
so
wonderfully
mixed
i
couldnt
even
begin
to
explain
them
so
i
leave
it
to
the
other
generous
bas
out
there
sweet
malt
attacks
the
palate
and
makes
me
beg
for
more
i
could
sip
this
all
night
truly
a
solid
beer
from
lagunitas
overall
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
should
probably
keep
the
abv
in
mind
though
great
aroma
and
delicious
a
new
favorite
of
mine
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
d
while
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
it
does
catch
up
to
you
if
youre
not
careful
it
does
start
to
warm
aggressively
the
more
you
drink
do
very
drinkable
a
delicious
brew
all
around
bomber
proves
no
match
and
makes
me
wish
i
had
another
d
great
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
lagunitas
would
get
this
one
again
for
sure
great
beer
is
this
better
than
red
rocket
a
giant
gooey
hoppy
red
so
up
my
street
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
super
smooth
carbonation
and
the
flavor
clings
like
crazy
to
the
inside
of
the
mouth
super
sticky
and
resinous
which
is
a
good
thing
this
beer
is
probably
a
little
heavy
to
be
called
extremely
drinkable
but
the
flavors
and
smoothness
make
it
come
close
drinkability
hugely
drinkable
given
the
abv
the
flavors
are
strong
and
intense
yet
this
beer
manages
to
not
completely
overwhelm
the
palate
if
i
thought
i
could
survive
drinking
this
as
a
session
beer
i
would
if
i
find
this
again
fresh
i
will
drink
it
again
a
nice
hoppy
red
ale
pours
a
deep
and
clear
amber
with
a
tan
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
throughout
slow
carb
trails
smell
is
very
sweet
malty
with
caramel
predominating
taste
is
a
very
decent
balance
of
bitterness
and
those
sweet
toffee
malts
bold
flavor
but
not
overbearing
finishes
bitter
and
wet
feel
is
a
bit
thin
probably
because
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
bit
pronounced
other
than
that
a
solid
beer
that
drinks
more
like
an
old
ale
than
an
amber
this
brew
pours
a
deep
rich
ruby
red
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
sticky
lacing
everywherethe
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
carameltoffeesticky
date
pudding
and
some
medicinal
hopsit
has
a
nice
sticky
above
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
really
coats
the
mouth
with
tastes
of
sticky
date
puddingtoffeepecan
pie
and
finishes
with
a
bitter
medicinal
hoppy
bitterness
which
counteracts
the
sweetness
nicelyoverall
a
very
nice
and
complex
brew
that
is
very
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
until
i
fell
off
my
chair
that
is
this
beer
is
amazing
it
could
deserve
an
a
or
5s
for
all
ratings
because
the
hard
malt
burst
of
red
ales
tops
this
brew
it
does
not
deserve
a
5
for
taste
mouthfeel
or
drinkablilty
overall
this
is
one
of
my
personal
favorite
beers
its
crispness
is
remarkable
urging
you
to
session
it
all
night
or
at
least
50
ounces
of
it
overall
a
really
nice
flavorful
and
smooth
take
on
a
hopped
up
amber
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
glad
the
brewers
decided
to
make
this
an
annual
offering
keep
em
coming
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
november
20
2010
it
emerges
as
a
deep
amberred
pour
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
long
lasting
but
thin
soapy
head
caramel
malts
greet
the
nose
followed
quickly
by
molasses
a
dark
fruitiness
and
pine
resins
the
bold
body
leads
to
a
sweet
red
bitterness
followed
by
a
fine
backdrop
of
hops
probably
my
second
favorite
red
thus
far
full
of
flavor
and
easy
drinking
my
only
criticism
is
its
slightly
heavy
on
the
roasted
flavors
but
very
tasty
they
should
change
the
name
of
this
beer
to
jesus
cream
because
thats
what
it
feels
like
is
being
poured
down
my
gullet
as
i
pull
the
bottle
to
my
lips
ive
only
seen
it
at
one
place
in
detroit
so
far
so
naturally
i
camp
out
in
a
tent
in
the
parking
lot
weekly
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
shipments

it
is

drinkable
for

as
i
said
an
imperial
red
but
is
held
back
a
little
by
its
extreme
nature
whelming
malt
slightly
imperfect
balance
and
what
i
consider
insufficient
carbonation
but
once
again
it
is
quite
quaffable
for
its
mondoness

down
quite
easily
bready
taste
resonates
making
you
want
to
wash
it
out
rather
than
go
for
another
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
so
take
it
easy
d
very
strong
flavor
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
perhaps
a
bit
much
for
some
but
i
would
never
believe
you
if
you
told
me
this
was
8

good
drinkabiity
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
amberred
ale
but
not
bad
just
not

pours
a
finger
of
loose
foam
over
a
clear
dark
orange
fluid
carbonation
is
moderate
but
steady
the
nose
orange
marmelade
and
yeast
funk
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
with
notes
of
molasses
and
a
firm
slap
of
medicinal
hop
off
the
back
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
not
unexpectedly
round
given
that
they
got
this
up
to
8
56
abv
all
that
alcohol
doesnt
really
make
itself
felt
except
as
a
feeling
of
wellbeing
so
take
care
aftertaste
is
grassy
medicinal
hops
just
a
tad
stickysweet
but
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
but
not
mind
blowing
it
honestly
smells
and
tastes
more
like
a
soft
ipa
than
a
hoppedup
brown
ale
however
it
is
refreshing
and
the
original
concept
and
always
low
lagunitas
price
will
bring
me
back
for
more
drinkability
is
good
but
the
one
bomber
was
the
perfect
volume
the
flavor
is
pretty
potent
warm
and
complex
so
i
wouldnt
go
all
night
with
this
one
but
its
a
really
nice
afterdinner
beverage
i
could
see
putting
back
one
of
these
bombers
in
the
winter
time
after
shoveling
the
snow
out
of
my
driveway
d
very
nice
balance
overall
excellent
beer
overall
i
was
worried
it
would
be
out
of
date
but
it
was
excellent
one
of
my
new
favorites
ill
be
picking
up
more
if
i
see
them
another
fine
offering
from
lagunitas
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
very
nice
beer
although
lacking
in
some
key
areas
well
whatever
im
happy
to
drink
it
im
still
waiting
for
an
australian
brewery
to
get
this
style
right
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
bottled
on

a
little
old
but
hopefully
not
past

prime

solid
inch
of
lumpy

formation
slowly
dissipates

reminds
me
of
bourbon
light
carbonation
good
lacing
very
nice
smell
light

i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
it
fresh
but
definitely
lively
the
must
have
been
amazing
when
it
was
younger
rich
malt
notes
of
molasses
and
maple
syrup
lie
just
below
the
hoppyness
fairly
light
body
but
with
a
robust
texture
a
smooth
sip
with
an
interesting
finish
hoppy
enough
so
that
when
the
malt
comes
through
you
get
hints
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
and
not
just
sweet
it
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
dubbel
in
that
respect
very
quaffable
for
such
a
big
beer
i
will
restate
my
original
sentiment
the
must
have
been
amazing
fresh
it
has
been
years
since
i
have
had
this
and
will
try
to
make
it
a
point
to
pick
one
up
next
year
as
soon
as
they
hit
the
shelf
salud
its
nice
to
find
a
good
red
ale
with
big
hops
presence
most
are
mainly
malt
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
nice
balance
and
flavors
in
this
red
ale
ive
tried
several
other
styles
of
beer
from
lagunitas
and
have
enjoyed
them
all
no
dissapointments
pours

clear

and

some

the

it
leans
more
toward
some
floral
hoppiness
grapefruits

nice

caramel

and
a
hint
of
cocoa
upfront
ample
hops
show
through
at
the
end
with
a
solidly
bitter
finish
that
features
just
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
i
loved
lagunitas
regular
red
ale
but
this
will
fit
the
bill
nicely
drinkability
interesting
red
ale
with
a
big
hop
presence
a
high
gravity
beer
that
drinks
remarkable
well
with
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
pours
a
clear
red

64
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of

alcohol
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber

feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet

of

slight
roasted

slight
yeast
and
slight

overall
good
aroma
body
appearance
blend
and
complexity
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
but
im
glad
i
did
once
another
solid
offering
from
lagunitas
the
hops
leave
behind
a
pine
sap
aftertaste
that
endures
if
you
drink
anything
after
this
one
youll
probably
still
taste
this
one
d
this
stuff
is
fantastic
i
could
drink
bombers
of
this
all
night
except
for
the
fact
that
id
regret
it
in
the
morning
the
flavours
are
delicious
with
powerful
hops
coming
through
but
still
offering
a
balanced
offering
number
13
has
never
been
so
lucky
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
id
highly
recommend
it
d
very
tasty
american
amber
even
if
it
is
outside
the
style
guidelines
but
arent
most
west
coast
ambers
out
there
now
anyway
and
at
5
a
bottle
this
is
a
great
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
2
finger
white
head
from
an
aggressive
pour
leaving
a
puffy
cap
and
thick
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
punch
in
the
face
no
wimpy
stuff
here
strong
caramel
malts
bolt
citrus
and
spicy
hops
are
present
the
taste
is
just
as
good
the
beginning
is
full
of
the
sour
citrus
hops
the
middle
is
full
of
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
from
malt
balance
and
the
finish
leaves
with
a
slight
bitter
but
pine
needle
fresh
hop
the
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
fit
this
to
a
t
very
solid
work
and
worth
the
strong
accolades
get
some
d
i
cannot
believe
this
is
an
almost
9
beer
because
it
is
so
smooth
and
easy
drink
i
usually
go
to
lagunitas
for
hoppy
beers
but
lucky
13
is
a
nicely
balanced
red
ale
yum
drinkability
enjoyable
beer
from
lagunitas
they
are
really
starting
to
become
a
favorite
of
mine
as
they
have
some
really
solid
beers
at
really
good
prices
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
and
probably
will
pick
up
some
more
d
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
to
me
really
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
better
lagunitas
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
a
big
beer
mondo
as
it
were
great
variety
and
balance
of
malts
sweet
fruity
spicy
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
another
home
run
for
lagunitas
served
on
tap
this
beer
is
a
hazy
amber
color
with
an
abundant
white
head
which
lingers
as
lacing
all
over
this
glass
smell
is
hoppy
but
does
not
prepare
one
for
the
taste
which
is
exceptional
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
with
a
bitterness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
a
great
orange
rind
citrussy
component
the
mouthfeel
is
neither
too
watery
nor
too
richjust
about
right
i
wish
this
wasnt
the
last
beer
i
had
tonight
as
it
is
one
i
could
drink
all
night
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
big
reds
and
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
this
one
except
that
its
a
damn
fine
brew
drinkability
very
drinkable
enjoyed
it
very
much
just
the
right
balance
of
bitterness
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
a
high
abv
ipa
like
dogfish
head
90
minute
and
i
guess
thats
a
compliment
d
nicely
drinkable
for
the
abv
lagunitas
made
a
great
beer
out
of
an
unappreciated
style
and
i
applaud
their
efforts
well
hot
damn
this
red
is
quite
a
treat
color
is
a
gorgeous
bright

the
head
is
moderate

thin

a

a
strong
supporting
cast
of
bitter
hops
and
malty
sweetness
very
wellbalanced
with
notes
of
fresh
fruit
lingering
on
the
lips
i
see
that
its
got
a
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
but
really
i
wouldnt

check

check
a

theres
just

one

amazing
price
and
an
abv
that
is
not
too
nasty
i
love
this
and
will
pick
up
more
lagunitas
always
nails
it
for
the
value
i
like
the
idea
of
just
throwing
a
shitload
of
hops
into
every
beer
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
this
brewer
drinks
like
a
dipa
and
a
good
one
at
that
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
its
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fell
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
not
a
big
in
your
face
hop
aroma
that
i
was
expecting
kinda
of
sweet
smelling
almost
candy
like
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
and
pine
meh
taste
is
about
the
same
its
a
big
beer
but
its
aint
mondo
its
actually
very
well
balanced
but
that
doesnt
mean
any
flavors
really
stand
out
its
hoppy
but
not
overly
bitter
mostly
grapefruit
and
light
citrus
and
the
sweetness
is
very
bready
with
touches
of
caramel
medium
body
average
carbonation
just
a
meh
beer
to
me
tastes
llike
just
about
every
single
other
lagunitas
beer
these
guys
are
starting
to
lose
me
make
something
different
for
a
change
another
strong
offering
from
lahgookneetuss
all
in
all
a
solid
offering
my
only
complaint
is
the
abv
maybe
it
has
to
be
that
high
to
get
the
flavor
but
i
bought
a
bomber
cracked
it
then
noticed
the
abv
if
it
was
a
bit
lower
it
would
be
more
drinkable
mfd
a
brief
fizzle
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
that
certainly
doesnt
overwhelm
the
flavor
by
any
means
drinkability
rates
very
good
as
well
a
nice
hoppy
ale
with
good
malt
character
found
this
to
be
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
the
wonderful
aroma
carries
over
to
the
taste
an
it
makes
this
a
great
flavorful
beer
seems
to
go
really
well
with
spicy
foods
share
this
one
with
someone
who
appreciates
beer
as
much
as
you
do
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
enjoyable
the
alcohol
can
be
felt
a
little
bit
toward
the
end
but
for
the
most
part
isnt
too
noticeable
would
have
again
overall
this
is
another
good
beer
by
lagunitas
and
it
shows
me
that
not
all
reds
are
tame
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
down
anytime
soon
dthe
carbonation
or
lack
thereof
is
a
bit
distracting
but
this
is
otherwise
a
really
enjoyable
bigger
beer
this
is
very
drinkable
for
the
double
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
red
ales
ive
had
d
its
a
great
red
easy
to
drink
for
8
56
abv
impressed
would
definitely
have
it
again
dyummy
nice
balanced
bigger
beer
the
price
is
right
too
definitely
try
it
out
i
could
drink
this
in
the
sahara
or
antarctica
but
probably
only
2
or
so
at
a
time
its
a
tad
strong
to
be
sessioning
this
mutha
unless
you
got
your
big
boy
pants
on
pours
a
nice
clear
reddish
copper
with
a
good
sized
persistent
head
lacing
on
the
surface
the
whole
way
down
the
glass
great
citrusy
hops
in
the
nose
along
with
some
rich
darker
fruit
notes
big
malt
flavor
toastiness
and
caramel
fruit
notes
again
citrusy
hops
are
also
present
but
not
overwhelming
at
all
a
little
boozy
in
the
finish
well
balanced
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
although
a
bit
heavy
very
good
overall
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
especially
for
the
price
i
would
have
liked
a
more
malty
presence
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
good
had
it
on
draft
and
i
prefer
the
bottle
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
smells
which
im
like
i
was
ready
for
syrup
but
the
lightness
while
swallowing
makes
this
one
a
good
beer
for
quick
sipping
deep
reddish
brown
brew
is
a
clear
dark
cherry

when
held
to
a
light
with
a
moderate
pour
it
generates

of
light
tan
foam
that
settles
to
a
thick
foamy
layer
smell
is
pretty
hoppy
with
a
robust
and
toasty
body
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
moderate
but
the
hops
and
carbonation
cut
through

theres
a

to
be
found
in
there
a
good
hoppy
and
robust
red
booze
is
very
well
hidden
in
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
super
hoppy
for
a
red
beginning
of
the
sip
is
nice
maltiness
followed
by
floral
citrousy
hops
kind
of
a
scorching
beer
worth
trying
but
i
would
make
it
one
of
the
last
beers
of
the
night
d
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
didnt
blow
my
mind
this
brew
pours

that
slightly
puckers
the
mouth
the

the

still
noticeable
chewy

a

the

and
carbonation
moderate
overall
a
very
flavorful
bold
beer
that
is
very
well
made
and
not
for
the
faint
of

this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
another
fine
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a

not
quite

poured
a
22oz
bomber
into
my
smokestack
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
rust
red
with
a
2
inch
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
head
eventually
resides
as
just
a
little
lily
pad
in
the
middle
of
my
glass
i
have
to
give
it
to
lagunitas
they
really
know
how
to
pack
a
ass
load
of
aroma
and
flavor
into
a
3
99
bomber
i
really
wish
more
breweries
would
follow
their
lead
this
one
is
the
same
the
nose
is
nothing
short
of
a
ass
ton
of
hops
and
a
butt
load
of
malt
up
front
is
a
blast
of
citrus
hops
it
almost
reminds
me
of
sticking
my
nose
into
a
bowl
of
fruit
loops

right
after
that

down

caramel
and
over

man
this
is
tasty
with
the
nose
so
hop
heavy
im
surprised
that
its
so
malt
forward
big
caramel
and
toffee
notes
sweet
candied
dark
fruits
and
just
a
bit
of
heavily
toasted
bread
after
that
is
a
blast
of
tropical
fruits
mango
pineapple
and
tangerine
but
its
all
complimentary
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
medium
bodied
and
finishes
dry
in
my
mind
lagunitas
is
the
best
brewery
in
the
nation
great
beers
at
great
prices
pours
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
dark
dried
fruits
with
sweet
sugars
taste
is
exactly
how
it
smells
great
flavor
to
this
such
sweet
sugary
fruitiness
followed
up
by
some
very
fresh
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
and
refreshing
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
all
in
all
this
is
a
superbly
balanced
beer
its
citrus
hints
and
flavours
embody
what
a
california
beer
should
red
large
and
mondo
this
one
surely
is
tasty
and
drinkable
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
boozy
to
be
all
that
much
of
a
sessioner
though
im
more
than
tempted
right
now
with
2
buck
tuesday
still
in
full
effect
good
thing
my
hotel
is
within
stumbling
distance
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
involved
not
really
a
red
ale
outside
of
color
but
worth
enjoying
nonetheless
quite
a
change
of
pace
for
a
red
never
though
of
an
imperial
red
but
im
impressed

a

alcohol
was
nicely
hidden
great
beer
d
awesome
balance
for
a
high
gravity
brew
makes
it
very
drinkable
overall
this
a
very
good
red
ale
at
a
fantastic
price
d
bold
red
weve
got
here
and
its
works
very
well
no
sign
of
the
abv
if
its
around
on
tap
snag
one
d
im
usually
hit
or
miss
with
the
imperial
amber
style
this
was
a
huge
hit
for
sure
great
to
look
at
smell
and
taste
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
for
sure
well
done
pours
a
deep
mostly
clear
amber
with
a
foamy
tan
head
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
heavy
lacing
and
a
nice
haze
over
the
top
of
the
beer
nose
is
malty
with
some
toffee
and
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
lots
of
malty
character
with
some
caramel
notes
and
a
perfectly
assertive
hoppiness
in
the
middle
before
a
nice
malty
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
stickiness
to
the
finish
drinkability
is
outstanding
i
tend
to
skip
over
more
reds
in
generally
not
that
i
dislike
them
they
just
dont
tend
to
do
much
for
me
not
the
case
here
even
at
8
5
which
is
hidden
well
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
brew
comparatively
speaking
the
price
is
dirt
cheap
too
which
never
hurts
drinkability
solid
enough
plenty
of
nose
and
flavor
and
the
bitter
hop
profile
is
certainly
refreshing
enough
abv
feels
like
a
bit
much
but
if
nursed
slowly
enough
this
beer
is
easy
enough
to
drink
d
great
beer
great
price
enjoy
a
few
if
you
can
what
is
this
an
imperial
red
a
dipa
a
light
barleywine
whatever
it
is
i
love
it
and
probably
will
be
buying
more
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
abv
is
almost
non
existent
i
usually
stay
away
from
reds
because
most
of
them
are
more
malty
then
i
usually
appreciate
but
i
think
lagunitas
has
struck
a
nice
balance
here
my
only
complaint
is
the
aroma
or
lack
thereof
drinkability
is
great
for
a
beer
of
its
abv
but
i
dont
think
i
could
session
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
its
nice
and
refreshing
drinkability
easy
drinking
when
considering
the
abv
watch
out
d
pretty
hoppy
almost
like
a
dipa
but
maltier
red
ales
arent
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
better
than
most
strong
flavors
of
both
caramel
malt
and
bitter
hops
but
very
balanced
interesting
beer
aroma
and
flavor
are
all
mixed
up
with
some
really
malty
notes
coming
through
sometimes
and
more
bitter
hoppy
elements
dominating
at
other
times
i
even
get
a
little
bit
of
some
mild
spiciness
from
this
carbonation
seems
about
right
and
the
slightly
higher
than
normal
abv
is
hidden
well
interesting
tasty
brew
and
something
i
would
drink
again
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
big
beer
in
many
aspects
but
the
balance
makes
it
very
drinkable
clear
brown
amber
with
a
rich
head
that
produces
plenty
of
lace
nearly
no
visible
carbonation
predominant
aroma

drinks
like

excellent
hoppy
red
glad
i
got
mine
drinkability
pretty
darm
smooth
for
a
8er
drinkability
is
an
issue
here
because
of
a
combination
of
the
beer
being
thick
and
a
lot
more
biting
bittering
flavor
from
the
hops
than
i
like
the
taste
is
the
smell
with
a
creamy
thickness
to
it
very
nice
hop
character
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
hefty
red
and
should
be
treated
as
such
very
delicious
though
this
is
a
delicious
and
near
perfect
strong
red
ale

hope
to
be
able
to
get
more

in

ordinary
category
d
something
to
drink
slow
and
enjoy
flavors
develop
and
come
out
as
it
warms
up
i
like
it
and
since
i
have
fresh
bottles
at
my
store
ill
get
some
more
d
one
of
the
best
things
i
had
at
the
brewery
very
drinkable
and
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
amber
ales
a
very
good
brew
that
might
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
session
beer
for
me
but
it
leaves
a
nice
malty
hoppy
taste
lingering
this
beer
leans
more
towards
and
ipa
than
a
red
ale
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
none
the
less
my
only
knock
is
that
it
was
a
tad
bit
too
sweet
but
besides
that
it
was
very
good
and
another
solid
lagunitas
product
d
a
nice
amber
ale
that
has
some
nice
citru
hops
to
it
would
try
again
im
not
an
expert
on
this
style
of
beer
but
i
dont
see
the
huge
difference
between
this
and
a
strong
ipa
or
a
regular
dipa
none
the
less
this
is
a
great
beer
totally
somewhere
in
between
an
amber
and
an
ipa
not
my
favorite
but
still
nice
and
quite
tasty
you
definitely
know
youre
drinking
something
but
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
8
5
another
new
addition
to
vegas
and
surprised
at
the
low
cost
poured
into
tulip
why
not
be
fancy
pours
a
very
nice
cherry
wood
color
with
good
head
and
retention
great
lacing
smell
is
of
citrusy
hops
some
sweet
malt
but
mainly
the
hops
i
swear
this
is
almost
pliney
like
taste
is
good
a
little
sweet
but
not
too
much
very
smooth
and
sweet
initial
taste
with
a
bitter
citric
hop
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
another
beer
geek
told
me
this
had
a
cherry
taste
to
it
and
i
didnt
see
that
at
all
the
standard
grapefruit
and
citrus
taste
as
many
west
coast
beer
how
this
beer
is
an
amber
confuses
me
i
pretty
much
got
ipa
all
the
way
mouthfeel
was
fine
not
too
full
at
all
and
a
nice
oily
aftertaste
overall
a
really
good
beer
especially
for
the
3
99
pricetag
that
was
on
the
bomber
pours
a
clear
reddishamber
color
with
about
a
halfinch
of
light
khaki
colored
head
that
had
ok
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
malty
upfront
and
hoppy
at
the
back
the
flavor
was
a
bit
malty
sweet
with
a
sharp
hop
finish
the
body
was
decent
and
drinkability
was
good
overall
a
very
nice
little
beer
nothing
great
but
enjoyable
worth
trying
another
well
done
hoppy
red
ale
from
cali
no
more
no
less
a
bit
sweet
for
me
to
make
it
a
regular
but
i
did
enjoy
it
beer
falls
a
little
flat
on
flavor
unfortunately
i
guess
the
aroma
propped
me
up
to
expect
a
big
bitter
finish
and
its
just
not
there
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
drinkability
is
high
mostly
malt
in
the
front
on
the
mouth
and
a
gradual
diminuendo
of
flavor
until
the
flat
finish
pours
a
pretty
amber
color
with
some
eggshell
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
decently
large
hop
aromas
on
this
one
a
bit
of
sticky
caramel
and
sweetness
too
taste
follows
like
a
red
barleywine
or
something
pretty
interesting
a
bit
of
resinous
hops
some
sweet
malt
in
there
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
too
a
nice
big
ale
from
lagunitas
here
nothing
too
incredible
but
a
decent
affordable
ale
nonetheless
very
smooth
medium
to
light
body
on
this
one
a
bit
prickly
on
the
hind
end
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
nice
one
i
would
buy
it
again
i
think
the
blending
in
the
flavor
and
the
balance
in
the
mouthfeel
make
this
brew
extremely
drinkable
and
therefore
a
dangerous
one
at
8
3
in
my
opinion
not
the
best
i
have
had
of
this
style
the
ipaamber
blend
but
probably
the
most
equal
balance
i
have
found
which
is
pretty
cool
darn
good
drinking
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
room
temperature
glass
mug
the
beer
has
a
very
pretty
orangeamber
color
its
crystal
clear
and
has
a
bit
of
carbonation
rising
within
there
is
a
thick
head
of
tan
foam
as
it
settles
patchy
lacework
is
left
behind
this
beer
looks
like
how
i
want
a
mug
of
beer
served
to
me
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
i
could
smell
caramel
malts
now
that
the
beer
is
in
the
glass
and
i
can
get
a
better
handle
on
the
aroma
i
can
smell
caramel
and
toffee
malts
oak
and
a
bourbonlike
alcohol
it
smells
strong
and
pleasing
the
taste
is
equally
impressive
crispy
toasted
malts
are
readily
apparent
and
give
the
beer
a
a
slightly
sweet
taste
reminiscent
of
brown
sugar
caramel
flavors
are
present
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
has
some
oakiness
the
entire
taste
has
an
underlying
bitter
presence
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
leaves
a
lot
of
coating
but
isnt
too
sticky
or
sweet
it
is
highly
carbonated
for
all
of
the
big
aspects
of
this
beer
it
is
an
imperial
red
after
all
it
is
very
drinkable
ill
easily
make
my
way
through
these
22
ounces
this
afternoon
i
find
myself
wishing
i
had
more
than
this
one
bottle
i
also
wish
i
had
consumed
this
beer
sooner
ive
had
this
bottle
for
a
few
months
and
i
think
the
hop
presence
has
suffered
ill
have
to
seek
out
a
source
of
fresh
bottles
drinkability
good
went
down
nice
and
i
could
easily
enjoy
another
bomber
wouldwill
drink
again
and
recommend
d
very
drinkable
lagunitas
sure
does
it
right
when
it
comes
to
hops
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
roasted
malt
profile
balanced
by
some
dark
fruit
notes
and
a
nice
earthy
pine
hop
bitterness
the
hop
profile
is
more
prominent
than
the
aroma
lead
on
thankfully
hints
of
cherry
slight
chocolate
and
other
dark
fruit
nicely
balanced
but
the
malt
profile
was
a
bit
too
strong
and
the
hops
were
as
prominent
as
i
prefer
very
impressive
and
interesting
flavor
in
this
beer
id
believe
it
if
i
was
told
that
this
beer
was
oakaged
from
that
awesome
vanilla
note
but
i
know
that
it
wasnt
apparently
this
was
an
anniversary
beer
that
lagunitas
decided
to
make
a
seasonal
offering
good
decision
another
excellent
lagunitas
not
what
i
expected
but
in
a
good
way
a
thin
pour
to
coppery
opaque
honey
brown
with
a
full
finger
of
offwhite
head
some
decent
lace
aromas
of
malty
vanilla
almost
a
goetze
cowtail
candy
but
rounded
by
some
hints
of
pepper
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
not
too
heavy
with
good
roasted
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
hop
that
leaves
a
strawberry
aftertaste
quite
nice
unexpected
a
bit
sweet
but
not
too
tacky
a
bomber
is
sufficient
although
some
might
go
for
more
d
this
has
decent
drinkability
i
dont
think
that
i
expected
this
beer
to
taste
this
way
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
nugget
nectar
profile
so
i
was
bound
to
be
a
bit
disappointed
because
of
that
fact
d
if
you
like
a
good
amber
with
plenty
of
gusto
yet
a
dry
finish
youll
love
this
probably
would
go
well
with
a
good
filet
mignon
rolled
and
grilled
with
roasted
garlic
or
even
a
decent
chocolate
dessert
very
easy
beer
to
drink
great
for
the
spring
season
i
will
be
buying
this
one
much
more
taste
of
malt
first
pine
grapefruit
brown
sugar
eerily
reminiscent
of
a
smaller
version
of
brown
shugga
but
very
tasty
not
quite
as
much
caramelized
sugar
flavors
good
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
pretty
nice
finishing
flavor
of
caramel
malt
and
some
sugars
plenty
sweet
and
tasty
i
would
get
a
couple
of
these
at
the
reasonable
price
point
verdict
rather
close
to
their
imperial
red
ale
lucky
13
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lagunitas
big
red
ale
a
nice
amber
ale
i
would
buy
it
again
bottle
via
bobsy
absolutely
beautiful
slightly
hazy
reddishbrown
pour
with
a
foamy
persistent
white
head
lots
of
cascade
hops
piney
grapefruit
and
a
lot
of
grass
taste
is
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
this
tastes
like
liquid
grass
very
smooth
palate
very
solid
beer
thanks
again
i
didnt
expected
it
to
be
that
good
pours
a
clear
amber
with
2
fingers
of
yellowishly
stained
head
tons
of
sticky
lace
cling
all
about
the
glass
nose
is
quite
citrusy
and
floral
from
the
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
in
there
as
well
taste
is
a
nice
mixture
of
malt
sweetness
similar
to
caramel
and
a
moderate
amount
of
hop
bitterness
coupled
with
a
warming
alcohol
driven
finish
medium
feel
with
light
carbination
very
drinkable
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
very
pronounced
for
8
and
the
hops
start
to
taste
and
smell
more
grassy
and
piney
very
nice
red
ale
a
warm
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
not
much
retention
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hop
notes
pleasant
but
not
overly
powerful
those
aromas
are
present
in
the
flavor
with
a
nice
brown
sugartoffeecaramel
malt
flavor
blended
with
a
bright
citrus
grapefruitorange
flavor
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
toned
down
version
of
brown
sugar
mediumbodied
and
low
on
the
carbonation
also
a
bit
cloying
on
the
finish
maybe
could
have
used
a
little
more
hop
to
balance
out
at
any
rate
its
a
decent
beer
that
may
be
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
lagunitas
other
offerings
id
probably
recommend
the
imperial
red
or
brown
shugga
over
this
one
though
d
very
high
well
balanced
really
enjoyable
lagunitas
makes
so
many
great
extremely
drinkable
beers
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
amber
colored
with
a
amber
head
and
decent
lacing
the
beer
was
hoppy
smelling
and
really
hoppy
tasting
too
much
hops
i
thought
it
was
an
ipa
if
you
like
a
hop
bomb
go
for
it
i
will
not
buy
again
one
of
the
most
drinkable
8
abv
beers
out
there
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
just
enough
hoppiness
backed
by
a
smooth
caramel
malt
to
make
it
very
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
the
pour
is
a
medium
amber
and
rich
copper
color
with
a
great
strong
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
spier
silk
lacing
the
aroma
is
hot
hoppy
and
sweet
plenty
of
orangey
citrus
hops
with
the
abv
adding
some
spice
to
the
hop
nose
the
caramel
and
crystal
malts
lend
a
sweet
bread
smell
to
the
mix
the
taste
starts
super
orange
and
cane
suagr
then
toasted
malt
and
some
warm
bitter
orange
zest
snaps
the
middle
of
your
palate
and
slowly
recedes
all
the
way
to
the
finish
this
beers
palate
is
bitter
at
first
then
add
som
alcoholic
heat
to
that
bitterness
and
youll
have
the
finish
pretty
good
and
pretty
heated
red
ale
overall
a
very
welldone
beer
by
lagunitas
this
is
a
superb
beer
from
a
brewery
that
produces
some
of
my
favorites
strong
enough
to
have
some
backbone
but
not
so
strong
that
you
can
enjoy
a
bit
of
this
without
getting
knocked
about
lagunitas
is
one
left
coast
brewery
that
is
not
afraid
to
let
the
malts
shine
and
not
blow
it
all
to
hell
with
over
the
top
hopping
bravo
this
hits
the
ball
out
of
the
park
taste
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
recommend
getting
it
as
fresh
as
possible
one
of
those
highly
hopped
beers
that
doesnt
age
the
greatest
has
the
irish
red
thing
underneath
all
the
hops
and
bitterness
hides
the
alcohol
well
lingers
nicely
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
nice
surprise
from
what
i
am
use
to
which
is
hops
hops
and
mor
hops
would
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
plus
i
really
like
the
artwork
on
the
label
great
red
color
very
good
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
ill
get
this
again
whenever
i
see
it
on
draft
great
for
any
season
notes
most
notable
cask
experience
ive
ever
had
i
had
a
few
maybe
not
too
many
cask
servings
over
the
years
but
i
typically
prefer
them
seeking
their
complexity
and
uniqueness
this
one
made
the
top
of
experiences
what
a
brew
revealing
its
potential
as
a
live
ale
overall
lots
nay
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
rapidly
this
however
does
not
make
the
beer
too
fizzy
like
many
ive
had
lately
mouth
is
substantial
and
appropriate
and
probably
due
to
the
obvious
alcohol
id
say
this
malt
verges
on
scotch
ale
poured
a
dark
orangish
brown
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
big
dirty
white
head
nose
is
warm
with
citrus
pine
bread
and
malt
taste
is
a
thick
malt
flavor
and
pretty
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
bready
warm
with
hops
and
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
the
strongest
amberred
i
have
ever
had
that
i
recall
even
with
the
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
sweet
and
refreshing
i
would
have
this
again
overall
a
very
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
a
favorite
of
mine
i
think
going
forward
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
trying
this
one
when
i
see
it
in
the
local
store
not
bad
of
a
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
nice
soup
beer
or
a
good
winter
beer
like
the
flavor
can
see
myself
eating
a
good
cheese
product
with
this
such
as
raclette
not
bad
or
a
good
beer
cheese
fondue
like
my
bday
this
last
week
you
know
will
have
again
definitely
keep
strong
on
this
for
a
good
time
delicious
i
believe
it
to
be
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
had
very
drinkable
beer
with
great
taste
will
look
for
this
beer
again
poured
a
medium
reddish
brown
with
a
moderate
head
that
reduced
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
malty
the
taste
was
a
good
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
malty
sweet
there
was
no
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
was
reasonably
good
lucky
13
may
be
a
red
ale
but
it
drinks
more
like
an
apa
rubycopper
color
cream
colored
head
was
less
than
a
finger
from
a
pretty
lazy
pour
sweet
malty
notes
are
prominent
in
the
nose
along
with
a
floral
hops
not
bursting
with
the
piney
hops
of
other
lagunitas
brews
ive
sampled
sweet
caramel
malts
up
front
with
a
nice
influx
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
left
a
hint
of
grapefruit
moments
after
swallowing
didnt
reallyget
a
sense
of
the
alcohol
till
that
warming
feeling
hit
my
belly
i
was
unimpressed
upon
my
first
drink
but
it
really
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
nice
balance
just
a
hair
on
the
sweet
side
it
is
however
very
good
for
a
red
ale
this
is
a
solid
complex
beer
very
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
too
bad
its
an
anniversary
release
and
not
on
their
fulltime
brewing
schedule
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
little
kick
malt
grass
hops
and
a
nice
earthiness
end
is
thick
dry
and
bitter
22

also
a

its

well
carbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
i
enjoyed
it
22
ounce
bomber
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
the
aroma
seems
to
be
fresh
citrusy
hops
mixed
with
sweet
caramel
malt
and
the
taste
follows
suit
abv
is
masterfully
hidden
by
the
beautiful
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
tastes
almost
reminds
me
of
an
aged
double
ipa
probably
a
bit
out
of
style
but
who
cares
i
suppose
we
have
to
fit
all
beers
into
a
category
but
lagunitas
seems
to
always
push
the
envelope
of
style
with
some
flair
for
the
dramatic
yet
another
awesome
beer
from
lagunitas
in
an
expanding
collection
of
amazing
shit
drinkability
the
beer
id
describe
as
the
closest
to
this
is
arrogant
bastard
which
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
this
is
higher
in
alcohol
and
may
be
even
smoother
than
the
bastard
although
its
not
quite
as
wellbalanced
highly
recommended
d
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
certainly
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
lagunitas
if
youre
expecting
a
red
ale
you
might
be
disappointed
but
it
is
a
damn
good
beer
nice
great
head
very
hoppy
smell
to
it
right
away
the
great
big
hop
taste
comes
jolting
out
a
great
big
gulp
from
my
mug
and
instant
heaven
sweet
caramel
flavors
with
a
nice
bitter
and
god
is
it
ever
smooth
its
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
say
that
this
wont
be
the
only
time
that
i
will
be
picking
up
this
beer
its
a
house
favorite
one
finger
of
head
sits
atop
a
deep
copperbrown
body
good
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smell
is
caramel
malts
apple
skin
wax
and
pine
cone
the
taste
is
very
sharp
and
refreshing
the
malt
really
jumps
out
at
first
but
a
big
wave
of
pine
hop
bitterness
is
lurking
underneath
havent
really
had
many
beers
of
this
style
that
i
enjoyed
but
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
normally
prefer
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
overall
and
one
worth
purchasing
but
not
necessarily
seeking
out
d
great
beer
this
beer
really
deserves
and
imperial
red
category
for
it
is
far
out
of
the
league
of
bud
american
ale
hoppy
fragrant
fairly
well
balanced
and
sticks
with
you
i
quite
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
an
excellent
value
for
what
is
really
a
dipa
or
imperial
red
lucky
13
is
readily
available
to
me
at
3
99
a
bomber
i
hope
to
enjoy
this
again
big
red
with
that
come
to
be
expected
lagunitas
hop
bite
glad
to
try
it
on
the
last
day
of
summer
first
day
of
fall
2009
i
like
it
sweet
yet
hoppy
a
very
enjoyable
red
ale
starts
off
with
some
nice
malt
sweetness
ends
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
lots
of
caramel
with
notes
of
honey
nice
bit
of
citrus
hops
that
you
can
typically
find
in
other
lagunitas
beers
a
small
dose
of
pine
a
very
drinkable
and
stronger
red
ale
well
heck
i
havent
been
all
that
impressed
with
the
brewery
before
now
but
this
one
this
one
i
like
a
lot
wish
it
were
less
expensive
d
a
tasty
and
potent
red
ale
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
the
medium
body
became
more
and
more
smooth
as
the
contents
of
my
glass
diminished
very
nicely
done
and
highly
drinkable
lagunitas
is
brewing
some
excellent
ales
at
more
than
reasonable
prices
i
paid
less
than
five
dollars
for
this
bomber
kudos
d
deadly
drinkable
one
endeavoring
to
see
me
sober
at
the
end
of
the
night
would
do
well
to
keep
this
bad
boy
away
from
me
drinkability
is
good
slightly
sweet
and
sticky
which
makes
the
abv
moderately
present
d
very
drinkable
fine
balance
between
robust
hops
mild
bitterness
malts
alcohol
potency
overall
great
balance
kind
of
similar
to
lagunitas
other
big
beers
out
there
but
probably
my
favorite
so
far
usually
dont
like
imperial
red
ales
dt
overhopping
but
this
one
seems
to
do
it
right
very
drinkable
especially
when
considering
the
high
abv
would
choose
this
any
day
over
winter
yulesmith
or
shark
attack
red
by
port
brewing
well
balanced
good
mouthfeel
neither
too
thick
or
too
thin
i
had
these
hours
and
beers
apart
neither
time
did
i
want
another
one
right
after
a
lot
there
for
me
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
am
fairly
sad
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
it
is
refreshing
goes
down
smooth
found
on
tap
at
moes
in
lee
ma
this
shows
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
very
nice
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
tasteful
but
mild
grapefruit
hop
that
leaves
me
unsure
of
exactly
what
it
packs
however
the
first
taste
declares
a
sharp
pine
hop
with
a
heavy
caramel
overtone
that
settles
sweetly
on
the
tongue
midbodied
for
a
nice
feel
with
subtle
carbonation
quite
drinkable
if
youre
a
hophead
otherwise
not
this
almost
settles
into
a
rhubarb
tartness
with
a
wheat
grain
mellow
base
very
good
stuff
but
lagunitas
rarely
disappoints
cheers
d
very
drinkable
if
you
arent
a
fan
of
hops
dont
drink
this
one
that
way
there
is
more
for
me
lagunitas
makes
good
quality
beer
and
they
hit
the
mark
on
this
one
quite
good
worth
trying
this
is
my
first
tasting
of
an
american
amberred
ale
an
am
hoping
to
find
nugget
nectar
to
compare
drinkability
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
gets
a
bit
sweet
at
times
for
my
palate
but
i
enjoy
the
bitter
aspects
well
enough
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
overall
flavor
was
exceptional
will
attempt
to
purchase
more
while
it
is
available
d
for
what
this
isa
big
red
beerthis
is
a
drinkable
beer
of
course
one
must
be
aware
that
this
beer
packs
quite
the
bite
d
best
red
ale
ive
had
possibly
really
a
great
beer
here
something
special
i
might
need
to
start
buying
this
more
often
this
is
hitting
a
special
spot
taste
is
initially
full
of
the
aroma
characters
plenty
of
big
malt
flavor
and
caramel
sweetness
this
however
gives
way
a
little
to
my
surprise
to
very
nice
hoppy
citrusy
finish
the
hops
really
do
a
great
job
of
balancing
things
out
much
more
than
i
expected
d
by
the
time
i
finished
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
when
i
started
and
i
definitely
wanted
another
mmm
copper
colored
brew
one
finger
offwhite
head
good
lacing
hops
predominate
a
bit
in
the
nose
but
bready
malts
with
a
bit
of
lingering
caramel
are
noted
spicy
hops
on
the
tastebuds
a
bit
of
grapefruit
but
a
hot
alcohol
finish
makes
this
a
less
than
fully
drinkable
brew
busy
mouthfeel
plenty
of
carbonation
not
as
heavy
as
stone
13th
anniversary
which
is
the
best
comparator
i
can
see
in
this
tricky
imperial
red
category
this
is
a
big
malt
amber
and
balanced
by
piney
hops
a
lot
of
taste
here
a
little
bit
more
sweet
then
i
would
like
almost
too
much
for
a
bomber
on
a
warm
summers
night
especially
if
you
let
it
sit
and
warm
up
a
bit
i
would
say
this
is
a
nice
big
west
coast
red
beer
for
a
crisp
night
this
is
a
bold
red
ale
that
was
heavy
on
the
hops
and
was
more
carbonated
that
id
normally
like
the
strength
makes
it
ideal
for
putting
just
a
bit
cooking
i
put
it
into
my
burgers
and
was
amazed
dont
expect
to
drink
this
one
all
night
but
it
is
a
great
way
to
start
a
bbq
deep
malts
initiate
on
the
flavor
a
bit
of
robust
carbonation
confuses
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
concludes
notably
better
as
the
carbonation
settles
for
a
bit
and
the
beer
warms
from
fridge
temp
feel
and
drink
are
good
and
also
improve
with
some
warming
finishes
with
some
spice
and
warmth
and
offers
a
nice
hop
texture
nose
remains
a
bit
nondescript
odd
carbonation
issues
as
the
beer
pours
somewhat
flat
yet
was
fizzy
on
the
tongue
for
the
first
ten
minutes
overall
a
rich
and
robust
amber
big
but
not
yulesmith
winter
in
complexity
drinkability
while
i
split
this
bomber
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
then
one
it
was
just
too
sweet
cheers
d
well
crafted
tastes
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
an
amber
red
probably
one
of
the
best
lagunitas
beers
i
have
ever
had
probably
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
i
have
had
as
well
nice
strong
and
complex
flavor
that
has
perfect
balance
great
beer
and
i
hope
this
one
stays
in
lagunitas
regular
rotation
d
another
big
tasty
ale
from
lagunitas
a
lot
to
like
here
especially
for
the
4
price
tag
its
hefty
and
youll
start
to
feel
it
halfway
through
the
bomber
but
its
nice
to
find
something
that
can
jostle
you
around
a
little
and
still
leave
a
good
impression
poured
a
clear
redbrown
body
with
a
twofinger
light
tan
head
with
patches
on
the
glass
caramelized
and
toasted
malts
along
with
a
little
bread
mix
with
a
strong
dose
of
herbalspring
hops
hops
are
more
pronounced
than
usual
so
they
are
even
with
the
malts
a
thintomedium
body
with
some
sweetness
from
caramel
malt
along
with
a
drying
sensation
that
comes
from
some
biscuit
maltgrainy
hops
also
some
hop
bitterness
that
leads
to
the
dry
backbite
despite
the
malts
giving
this
beer
a
little
stickiness
with
the
beers
malthop
balance
between
sweet
and
piney
dryness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
if
i
want
a
red
i
am
looking
for
a
tad
less
hops
still
i
recommend
this
as
a
musttry
for
anyone
d
i
dont
necessarily
want
to
finish
it
the
more
i
drink
it
but
its
definitely
not
close
to
a
drainpour
its
good
all
around
but
a
bit
offputting
on
the
finish
recommended
great
with
a
mildly
spiced
ribeye
and
blue
cheese
iceberg
wedge
one
of
lagunitas
better
offerings
this
is
a
big
flavor
beer
that
pairs
very
well
with
big
flavored
foods
it
went
great
with
a
big
grilled
burger
with
the
works
and
a
sicilian
pasta
salad
overall
lots
of
flavor
that
begs
to
be
paired
with
dead
red
meat
yummy
fantastic
beer
on
par
with
hop
stoopid
dam
has
to
be
the
tastiest
amber
ive
had
to
date
served
cold
its
a
big
slam
of
amarillo
hoppy
goodness
there
is
some
malt
to
go
along
with
it
but
its
mostly
a
hop
bomb
let
it
warm
up
and
its
almost
a
different
beer
the
malt
sends
the
hops
to
the
back
seat
and
takes
over
all
said
its
a
fantastic
beer
i
could
stick
with
it
all
night
my
only
complaint
is
the
color
fora
self
proclaimed
mondo
red
ale
its
pretty
copper
almost
brunette
color
d
i
can
say
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
and
im
glad
that
i
have
had
the
experience
i
dont
know
if
id
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
as
the
winter
warmer
sort
of
spices
get
a
bit
much
for
me
but
combined
with
this
new
style
they
are
quite
good
in
fact
i
hope
they
make
this
in
december
get
a
bottle
and
enjoy
final
thoughts
lots
more
biscuit
the
more
i
drink
a
little
too
sweet
but
a
nice
heavy
red
ale
closer
to
a
nonsourtangyfruity
barleywine
or
heavy
old
ale
a
great
change
for
lagunitas
from
the
usual
hop
bomb
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
not
too
fizzy
drinks
well
too
and
and
a
very
nice
experience
for
less
thatn
4
a
bottle
its
a
great
offering
again
im
a
fan
of
a
lagunitas
brew
i
really
liked
this
stuff
the
only
problem
is
i
liked
hop
stoopid
twice
as
much
its
available
year
round
and
its
cheaper
at
most
places
so
it
looks
like
this
wont
become
a
regular
in
the
fridge
but
this
22
oz
bomber
was
definitely
a
treat
i
paid
five
bucks
for
the
bomber
which
i
think
is
a
great
deal
ill
be
back
for
more
and
recommend
others
give
this
a
try
as
well
a
hop
bomb
of
an
imperial
red
for
the
first
time
since
ive
been
reviewing
i
couldnt
even
remember
if
i
had
reviewed
or
even
tried
to
be
honest
lagunitas
normal
imperial
red
ale
it
turns
out
that
10
months
ago
i
really
liked
it
and
10
months
later
i
really
like
this
one
too
its
a
very
hoppy
red
theres
good
malt
character
fruity
and
sweet
lurking
beneath
the
waves
of
hop
resins
but
its
not
the
star
of
the
show
the
hops
come
through
with
a
big
piney
bitterness
that
is
mostly
rounded
out
by
the
malt
caramel
its
like
biting
a
pine
needle
candy
bar
theres
also
some
grapefruit
rind
and
maybe
even
tangerine
rind
connoisseur
to
connoisseur
anyway
its
a
very
nice
beer
if
you
like
hoppy
west
coast
style
dipas
or
assertive
hop
charaters
generally
d
abv
is
well
hidden
and
only
becomes
remotely
appearant
as
the
beer
nears
room
temp
great
overall
flavor
hell
exceptional
overall
flavor
i
finished
the
bomber
and
i
want
more
i
wish
lagunitas
would
make
this
into
a
year
round
cause
this
is
easily
thier
best
yet
imho
d
very
easy
drinking
for
such
a
hoppy
and
boozy
ale
this
is
a
great
red
ale
great
hops
nice
malt
balance
dare
i
say
its
better
that
stones
13th
it
just
might
be
it
really
is
a
big
red
and
the
hops
are
just
sublime
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
another
hit
from
lagunitas
d
honestly
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
found
it
much
better
as
it
warmed
and
its
ba
recommended
temperature
of
4550
f
is
a
bit
low
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
work
to
bring
out
the
complexity
of
its
flavor
but
this
is
something
ill
be
picking
up
again
to
see
ifhow
it
changes
i
love
the
price
too
under
5
good
on
the
front
end
lacking
on
the
back
notes
this
is
definitely
a
hopforward
imperial
red
but
manages
to
maintain
somewhat
of
an
equilibrium
from
the
hefty
malt
bill
fullflavored
bold
hoppedup
and
delicious
this
one
is
a
real
winner
recommended
d
very
drinkable
beer
quite
tasty
and
a
good
way
to
end
the
night
lucky
13
pours
a
deep
clear
red
with
an
off
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
down
my
tulip
aromas
are
grapefruit
caramel
slight
alcohol
presence
it
looks
beautiful
and
smells
that
way
too
plenty
of
caramel
malt
and
grapefruit
in
the
nose
not
heavy
in
the
body
but
plenty
there
highly
drinkable
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
being
thick
i
wish
this
was
lower
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
over
8
d
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinking
beer
but
the
abv
is
a
little
high
if
you
want
to
drive
home
after
one
get
a
dd
drinkability
ala
every
other
lagunitas
offering
ive
tried
is
marvelous
refreshing
crisp
and
tasty
it
is
the
stuff
of
warm
nights
and
good
music
drinkability
overall
a
great
beer
and
nice
anniversay
selection
pretty
large

slightly
hazy
and
good
lace
big

nose
with
a

of
bitter
hops

malts
in
the

a
bit
of
spicy
alcohol
as
it
warms

pretty
wet
pretty
solid
overall
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
has
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
mostly
hops
in
the
aroma
pine
mostly
but
a
touch
of
citrus
as
well
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
hops
with
the
malt
notably
abcent
pine
resin
hop
flavor
at
first
with
a
citrus
finish
i
really
miss
the
malt
i
like
in
red
ales
bitterness
is
high
medium
body
but
it
is
a
touch
overcarbonated
otherwise
has
a
nice
body
i
like
hopped
up
red
ales
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
could
of
been
better
with
some
malt
flavor
the
high
abv
and
high
bitterness
limits
drinkability
feels
smooth
and
creamy
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
right
circumstance
just
arrived
today
the
beer
pours
a
mahogany
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
with
a
fine
carbonation
and
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
isnt
very
strong
but
resinous
piney
hops
are
abundant
sipping
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
toasty
malt
is
apparent
followed
with
a
strong
hop
profile
pineapple
grapefruit
and
cedar
dominate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
to
fullbodied
the
flavors
last
for
a
long
time
even
with
its
color
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
red
unless
one
wants
to
name
a
new
style
category
known
as
west
coast
reds
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
other
comments
i
really
like
lagunitas
ipa
and
hop
stoopid
is
pretty
good
but
the
others
ive
tried
are
a
bit
off
the
mark
for
me
not
sure
what
exactly
i
dont
like
theyre
too
rich
or
something
and
theres
something
odd
in
the
background
flavor
pours
a
chestnut
amber
color
with
a
fresh
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
slowly
to
a
beige
ring
til
the
end
the
smell
is
oily
hops
fruits
and
nutty
malty
smell
smells
good
to
me
the
taste
is
hops
and
pine
first
with
some
fruit
and
bready
sweet
caramel
malts
hops
are
defiantly
in
charge
for
sure
in
this
i
will
call
it
an
imperial
amber
overall
this
is
yet
another
solid
offering
lagunitas
who
keeps
putting
out
winner
after
winner
i
find
this
enjoyable
and
very
smooth
and
scary
drinkable

will

defiantly
recommended
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
finger
or
so
of
creamy
offwhite
head
that
very
slowly
dissolves
and
never
completely
disappears
the
aroma
has
some
serious
resinous
piney
hops
along
with
some
aromas
that
are
reminiscent
of
barley
i
e
brown
sugar
dried
fruits
and
some
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
sweet
sticky
hops
upfront
with
some
dried
fruits
and
toasted
malts
and
a
soft
bitterness
to
round
things
off
this
is
a
full
to
medium
bodied
beer
and
is
very
sticky
but
at
the
same
time
has
ample
carbonation
very
interesting
seems
like
a
super
hoppy
barleywine
overall
it
does
get
much
hotter
as
it
warms
up
which
makes
it
a
sipper
super
smooth
and
drinkable
and
not
too
str4ong
in
the
alc
taste
dept
bit
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
most
redsambers
are
overall
a
very
good
offering
from
lagunitas
this
is
ridiculous
good
if
your
a
fan
of
ipas
and
a
fan
of
red
ales
this
is
your
beer
they
should
create
a
new
category
for
this
beer
and
big
hoppy
monster
only
the
slightest
bit
of
warmth
as
its
warmed
this
beer
is
fantastic
a
must
have
for
any
hop
lover
d
lagunitas
has
struck
another
winner
with
this
red
ale
nice
flavors
and
a
bit
of
class
drinkability
absolutely
a
must
for
any
lover
of
the
style
delicious
to
the
last
drop
the
appearence
is
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
light
chunky
off
white
head
that
recedes
down
nicely
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
citrus
hops
a
light
breadiness
as
well
the
taste
is
big
malts
very
sweet
and
caramel
i
dont
taste
as
much
hops
as
i
thought
i
would
but
its
enough
there
is
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
maybe
a
little
piney
taste
too
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
medium
low
carbonation
and
kind
of
a
thick
and
slick
feel
down
the
throat
overall
pretty
good
beer
the
hops
may
have
died
slightly
on
this
one
but
its
pretty
good
overall
given
the
high
abv
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
glad
to
have
tried
this
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
my
trusty
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
crimson
copper
color
with
an

of
sweet
caramelized
malt
and
toasted
grains
resinous
piney
hops
maybe
a
bit
of
tangerine
and
grapefruit

is
adequately
carbonated

its

bravo

d
overall

i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
have
a
thing
for
hopped

and
this

meets
my
craving

very
good
beer
thats
worth
getting
to
try
overall
a
memorable
strong
ale
cool
label

too
d
fairly
easy
drinking
but
it
just
doesnt
do
too
much
for
me
on
the
flavor
end
although
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
maltiness
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
bitterness
im
still
searching
for
that
amber
red
ale
that
can
hang
with
troegs

d
goes
down
well
a
pretty
nice
all
around
beer
compared
to
something
similar
oscar
blues
gordons
ale
which
i
recently
compared
to
this
this
is
darker
with
a
richer
more
complex
and
less
grapferuity
character
in
smell
and
taste
and
a
richer
frothier

would
rather
have
a

attack
d
damn
tasty
and
an
exemplary
example
of
the
style
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
take
er
easy
with
good
balance
to
this
beer
has
a
shitload
of
very
clean
malty
sweetness
and
alot
of
citrusy
hop
flavor
as
this
is
one
of
my
last
couple
bottles
and
has
aged
about
5
months
it
has
lost
some
of
the
bright
hop
bitterness
which
blows
but
it
is
still
drinking
phenomenally
fruity
aspect
is
nice
green
apples

abv
is

it

i
would
absolutely
love
to
see
this

rereleased
at
some
point
wonderful

opinion
i
am
actually
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
am
normally
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
red
ales
though
this
was
the
first
style
i
ever
brewed
this
one
has
enough
of
a
malty
backbone
and
hop
presence
to
satisfy
just
about
any
palate
i
dont
know
how
much
i
will
be
seeking
out
this
beer
in
the
future
but
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
if
i
saw
it
on

i
would
probably
give
it

a
little

at

with
a

then
the
bitters
hit
the

the
tongue
and
kick
in
the
sweetness
however
sticks
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
as
the

finish
boldly
the
high
ac
is
only
evident
a
little

in

a
great
ale
for
hop
lovers
the
ac
is
a

up

contributes

smooth

the

this

one
of
my
new
go
to
red

its
got
great
balance
and
executes
the
style
perfectly
a
diamond
in

to
say

now
i
know

they
say
californians
brew

excellent
job
this
beer
pous
a
nice
copperredish
beer
with
a
frothy

the
first
thing
i
taste
is
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
followed
by
a
nice
mellow
hop
flavor
dont
let
the
mellow
taste
fool
you
this
beer
weighs

at

my
local
liquor
store
has
a
few
bottles
in
stock
and
i
make
it
a
point
to
grab
one
almost
everytime
i
stop
in
there
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
fan
of

too
much
halfway
through
the

a
malty
hop
fix
not
quite
pretty
good
works
as
a
big
red
ale
but
a
little
too
sweet
towards
the
end
overall
a
tasty
brew
nothing
amazing
nothing
flashy
nothing
i
will
intentionally
recommend
but
it
is
a
nice
take
on
a
mondo
large
red
ale
as
alot
of
brewers
these
days
think
all
they
have
to
do
to
make
an
a
rated
red
ale
is
hop
the
shit
out
of
it
and
turn
it
into
some
red
ipa
i
would
love
to
see
a
perfect
melding
between
something
like
this
and
your
hhrs
and
nns
a
good
brew
i
may
have
this
one
again
well
find
out
give
it
a
try
you
will
not
be
upset
i
wanted
to
love
this
but
could
not
i
love
aggressively
hopped
redamber
ales
this
had
a
chance
and
was
just
too
much
like
a
kids
candy
ive
tried
lagunitas
maximus
which
is
their
double
ipa
for
8
99
per

the
maximus
may
be
slightly
better
but
certainly
not
more
than
twice
as
good
as
price
would
suggest
smooth
slightly
chewy
mediumfull
body
good
effervescence
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
agood
brew
a
little
hoppier
than
my
normal
choices
and
a
bit
more
than
an
ale
should
be
i
suppose
d
a
solid
amber
ale
with
big
hop
characteristics
straight
from
the
brewery
fresh
this
would
probably
be
a
hop
explosion
wow
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
those
of
you
that
have
tried
ithacas
cascazilla
and
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
i
did
youll
absolutely
love
this
beer
it
looks
and
smells
great
has
a
nice
caramel
taste
with
a
hop
kick
to
it
and
finishes
smooth
and
creamy
its
almost
9
alcohol
yet
you
cant
detect
the
flavor
of
ethanol
delicious
beer
pours
a
clear
coppery
color
with
a
lot
of
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
tan
head
rises
lazily
fades
somewhat
quickly
and
leaves
behind
sheets
of
lacing
smell
is
intense
caramel
and
a
bit
of
a
faint
boozy
smell
comes
through
this
is
a
pretty
intense
malt
bomb
thick
sticky
chewy
caramel
flavors
some
faint
grapefruit
bitterness
tries
to
fight
its
way
through
the
malt
but
gets
knocked
back
down
mouthfeel
is
nice
very
sticky
chewy
some
lingering
bitterness
tasty
but
with
a
borderlinecloying
sweetness
that
would
prevent
this
from
being
something
id
want
a
whole
lot
more
of
definitely
worth
a
try
d
damn
good
i
might
have
again
if
i
find
it
it
is
a
spectacular

with
a
generous
piney

mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
very
full
drinkability
is
surprisingly
good
for
such
a
high
abv
this
is
a
wonderful
double
red
that
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
strong
ambers
the
drink
correlates
with
the
mouthfeel
a
little
thick
and
alcohol
after
taste
this
poured
a
clear
light
auburn
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
red
barley
with
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
rich
caramel
malt
and
copper
hops
with
a
slight
bit
of
coffee
malt
it
was
oily
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
interesting
flavor
that
was
clean
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
alcohols
a
little
up
there
but
you
knew
that
gettin
in
to
it
like
the
10
or
so
other
imperial
reds
that
lagunitas
makes
its
wellbalanced
decently
interesting
and
wellmade
theyve
found
something
that
works
and
are
sticking
to
it
with
minor
variations
does
that
make
it
terribly
interesting
no
but
it
does
make
for
a
decent
to
aboveaverage
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
take
on
a
style
that
in
my
opinion
is
hit
or
miss
good
robust
flavors
throughout
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
this
has
a
big
malty
presence
with
plenty
of
hops
yet
the
balance
seems
a
little
off
kilter
this
is
pretty
tasty
but
the
hop
profile
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
d
i
could
really
knock
these
back
the
balance
is
superb
you
get
both
a
nice
malty
taste
and
a
clean
hop
finish
the
alcohol
is
amazingly
hidden
alcohol
is
very
subdued

easy
drinkin

well
balanced

there
is
a

aroma
was
decent
mainly

but
some

taste
was
hoppy
and
sweet
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
good
texture
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
decent
beer
with
good
flavor
but
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
not
recommended
for
a
session

up

good
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
pretty
good
really
liked
this
one
the
best
lagunitas
brew
ive
had
so
far
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
another
winner
from
lagunitas
seek
it
out

you
can
beautiful

with
a
bone
white
head
that
leaves
a

the
smell
is

the
taste
is
complex
dry
and
sweet
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
perfect
in
the
mouth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
big
boy
totally
satisfying
and
balanced

delicious

big

nose
juicy
with
some

tastes
like

of

hops
and
a
good
bit
of
soft
sweet
underlying
malt
moderately
prickly
and
slick
adding
some
texture
to
a
medium
body
this
is
easy
drinking
for
the
strength
though
i
could
just
as
easily
move
onto
something
else
a
good
brew
probably
more
true
to
the
red
ale
style
than
most
others
but
the
hoppier
ones
will
always
get
more

dissipated
to
a
nice

collar
and
lacing
malty
caramel
dominates
the
aroma
with
some
resiny
pine
underneath
also
maybe
some
vague
dark
dried
fruit
and
a
hint
of
rummy
alcohol
taste
follows
suit
flavorwise
with
the
sweet
caramelly
malt
dominating
at
first
and
a
smooth
bitterness
balancing
it
out

not

found
it

overall
this
beer
is
fine
but
just
doesnt
hit
my
brewspot
this
brew
poured

with
a

throughout
the
entire

nose
of
brown

cloves
no
real

flavour
that
i
could
detectjust
a
hoppy
bitterness
i
felt
that
it
had
a
more
hoppy
taste
than
other
red
ales
i
usually
like
lagunitas
beers
but
not
very
fond
of
the
lucky
13
bottom
line
a
wonderful
beer
a
bit
thick
in
the
mouth
to
drink
too
many
but
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
meant
for
heavy
consumption
a
beer
i
will
be
buying
again
soon
well
done
d
totally
sessionable
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
yet
another

bomb

a

very
easy
to
drink
a
good

up
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
and
kick
back
with
the
fellas
body
medium
creamy
and
lightly
chewy
smooth
mouthfeel
and
killer

another
winner
i
liked
this
it
drank
well
and
the
amarillo
hops
were
a
welcome
touch
adding
some
pizazz
to
a
otherwise
very
malty
and
thick
imperial
amber
good
stuff
from
the
boys
in
petaluma
notes
i
was
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
it
is
worthy
of
a
taste
especially
if
you
like

ill
go
with
a
slighty
different
approach
it
looks
great
has
a

hoppy
taste
and
it
works
its
a
nice
brew
to
round
out
the
night
worth

type
brew
in

drinking
no
real
hints
of
the
abv
i
have
become
a
fan
of
hoppier
red
ales
as
of
late
lagunitas
should
keep
this
one
around
they
have
a
winner
overall
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
still
very
good
and
a
solid
pick
d
an
very
underrated
and
underbought
redamber
ale
its
evenness
is
unsurpassed
and
further
cements
lagunitas
as
a
top5
brewery
regardless
of
style
get
out
and
find
this
beer
it
is
a
topnotch
brew
d
just
ok
very
sweet
and
strong
but
a
good
experience
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
it
out
but
all
in
all
not
bad
i
like
find
some
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
results
from
a
little
flattening

nothing

that
lagunitas
puts
out
this
one
being
no

the
beer
before
the

the
head
bursts
out
to
form
a
dense

creamy
head
that
sits
like
a
milkshake
atop
the
deep
ruby
color
citrus
and
grassy
hop
aromas
fill
the
nose
with
sweet
grain
as
the
first
molocule
hits
the
tongue
the

parts
for
the
earthy
grassy
hop
flavor
the
full
round
flavor
lasts
through
the
whole
pint
with
some
caramel
sweetness
that
lends
to
a
metallic
hint
that
your
mind
might
pick
up
due
to
the
rusty
color
the
head
is
now
reduced
to
a
dollup
of
whipped
cream
in
the

of
the
class
as
i
pour
in
the
remainder
of

very
good
solid

an
enticing
and
eye
catching

the

pours

the
smell
of
fairly
sweet
with
a
distinctly
fresh
set
of
spicy
the
taste
is
redolent
a
barely
wine
although
its
clearly
not
the
bottle
describes
it
as
a

simplicity
is
the
theme
here
it
isnt
anything
to
write

about
nor

slow
and

this
is
a
session
beer
this
is
a
good
food
pairing
yard
work
and
shower
beer
as
it
stands
i
would
have
liked
either
a
little
more
malt
or
a
little
more
bitterness
but
it
does
its
job
nonetheless
as
a
standard
basic
amber
ale
definitely
better
than
many
ive
had
what
is
not
to
love
about
this
beer
i
love
the
description
as
a
rich
copper
ale
because
is
is
gloriously
rich
for
such
a
simple
beer
easy
to
overlook
but
this
just
has
everything
that
is
great
about
amber
ales
deep
copper
color
rich
caramel
light
sulfur
big
sweet
caramel
maltiness
with
little
to
counter
needs
more
hops
imho
not
bad
but
the
floaties
were
not
pleasant
wont
buy
again
finally
got
to
try
this
one
after
having
the
whole
lineup
mutiple
times
over
it
is
a
great
copper
ale
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
its
look
is
definitely
copper
and
the
taste
has
a
pretty
smooth
yet
a
little
bitter
taste
but
the
taste
isnt
super
flavorful
its
an
okay
beer
for
this
brewery
they
have
a
lot
better
beers
definitely
a
copper
color
very
little
head
which
is
a
khaki
froth
smells
like
carmal
malt
some
floral
just
atiuch
of
citrus
tastes
if
malt
pine
and
of
course
orange
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
with
a
real
nice
back
of
the
tongue
bitterness
dry
not
a
bad
beer
overall
after
reading
other
reviews
i
wasnt
expecting
very
much
from
this
brew
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
combined
with
a
malt
complexion
censored
has
enough
going
for
it
to
help
round
out
the
hoppy
character
one
of
my
new
favorite
ambers
as
ambersreds
are
my
favorite
style
i
had
to
give
this
a
try
its
not
bad
and
you
can
taste
the
higher
alcohol
content
versus
a
beer
of
the
same
type
like
avalanche
or
fat
tire
but
this
beer
is
wonderful
on
the
palate
meh
its
so
so
pretty
bland
smelled
and
tasted
like
alcoholic
apple
juice
not
a
very
good
beer
when
compared
to
others
from
lagunitas
solid
growing
bitter
thruout
and
smooth
this
is
one
really
nice
ale
interesting
and
well
crafted
i
enjoyed
this
for
one
bottle
but
too
much
sweetness
for
my
taste
enjoyed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
nice
copper
ale
brilliant
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
lingers
to
a
thin
pooling
layer
and
great
lacing
nose
of
rich
caramel
malts
spicy
hops
and
figs
flavors
are
delightful
for
the
style
sweet
malt
up
front
with
hoppy
bitterness
to
the
rear
flavors
of
fig
and
as
it
warms
vanilla
become
pronounced
and
vying
for
pole
position
over
the
hops
a
great
session
ale
with
a
lingering
bittering
hops
aftertaste
very
sessionable
worthy
11
is
a
winner
so
is
this
beer
deep
copper
visually
smooth
creamy
flavor
that
has
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
love
it
a

taste
will
leave

i
was
paying

a

at

for
a
beer
that
is
similar
but
not
as
good
hopefully
when

i
just
cant
say
enough
about

products

consistently
put

give
this

still
pretty

another

pours
a

and

nicely
balanced

copper

tasty
great

balanced
and
easy
drinkin
cheers
this
beer
smells
exotic
and
has
a
very
rich
satisfying
taste
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
a
true
amber
the
malt
flavor
was
a
little
thin
and
the
hops
for
an
amber
were
a
bit
much
also
the
beer
is
a
little
lacking
character
again
a
nice
beer
but
a
little
twodimensional
one
of
the
better
amber
types
in
the
game
this
one
is
clear
reddish
in
color
with
a
frothing
and
lasting
off
white
head
over
an
inch
tall
it
has
a
pleasant
nose
of
tangy
hops
over
a
robust
copper
malt
body
much
less
sweet
than
other
american
takes
on
the
style
which
lends
to
increased
drinkability
for
my
palate
not
over
hopped
but
certainly
aggressively
done
which
makes
this
sort
of
a
style
hybrid
between
the
more
conventional
amber
ale
and
the
new
red
ipa
types
not
quite
on
the
ipa
level
this
one
finishes
much
more
balanced
with
the
rich
caramel
malty
flavors
sticking
around
on
the
palate
for
a
little
while
after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
to
me
is
the
best
feature
full
bodied
but
drinkably
dry
creamy
and
expansive
and
well
enough
carbonated
not
a
reinvention
of
the
genre
by
any
stretch
but
a
clever
americanization
of
a
style
that
probably
needs
a
facelift
more
often
than
not
well
done
beer
from
lagunitas
here
the
sharp
citrus
hop
notes
and
moderately
bitter
finish
counter
a
slightly
rich
malt
character
to
make
for
an
overall
pleasant
experience
nothing
spectacular
but
very
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
flavorful
brew
the
closest
analogue
i
can
muster
is
domaine
dupage
although
the
flavors
here
are
more
coarse
and
strident
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
to
enjoy
but
its
worth
trying
very
unorthodox
in
its
approach
this
copper
ale
is
nicely
diverse
and
quite
flavorful
o
an
okay
brew
all
i
can
figure
is
i
originally
got
my
hands
on
an
older
bottle
that
hadnt
fared
well
lesson
learned
this
one
doesnt
age
well
drink
it
fresh
and
enjoy
o
considering
that
the
original
name
for
this
ale
was
the
kronick
example
of
the
style
solid

the

hoppiness
is
what
made
this
beer
for
me
other

the

are

sweet
amber
ale
done
by
a
west
coast
brewery
that
loves
making
hoppy
beers
is
quite
delightful
i
think
my
favorite
part
about
this
beer
besides
the
balance
where
you
dont
even
taste
the
almostseven
percent
alcohol
is
the
foam
that
floats
atop
the
beer
the
entire
time
that
you
drink
it
if
you
like
lagunitas

for
their
intensely

already

a

some

its
definitely
a

with
some

thrown
in

it

given

has
a

raw

a

still
a
lighter

this
would
be
ok
in
small
doses
d
this
is
interesting
and
rather
flavorful
for
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
i
wouldnt
say
its
sessionable
as
its
kind
of
estery
and
boozy
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
d
this
is
balanced
well
enough
with
bitterness
and
hoppiness
and
abv
to
be
a
regular
in
the
rotation
very
nice
looking
pour
although
the
head
is
a
bit
thing
its
a
very
deep
redbrown
color
it
smells
of
maple
syrup
to
me
i
dont
know
if
anyone
else
gets
that
but
it
has
a
very
caramely
and
syrup
smell
has
a
great
sweet
malt
taste
without
much
of
a
hop
aftertaste
not
much
complexity
to
the
taste
it
just
gets
maltier
and
sweeter
as
it
warms
up
overall
a
good
beer
i
was
shocked
to
find
that
it
was
5
9
on
abv
because
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
present
id
have
again
if
it
were
available
great
drinkability
and
worth
the
try
i
think
smell
is
of
dark
malts
slight
fruit
taste
of
caramel
malts
slight
hoppyness
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
finish
quite
well
balanced
id
enjoy
finishing
another
couple
of
these
pours
a
dark
copper
with
minimal
head
that
diminishes
to
ring
in
no
time
the
head
is
not
needed
with
this
beer
as
its
taste
does
all
the
work
a
delectable
red
ale
dont
want
to
go
as
far
as
saying
one
of
the
best
ive
had
but
its
up
there
has
a
spiced
flavor
to
it
forgive
me
if
im
wrong
but
i
also
pick
up
anise
and
licorice
scents
mouthfeel
is
extraordinary
very
thick
for
a
red
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
and
am
becoming
a
big
fan
of
lagunitas
pretty
good
to
darned
solid
good
like
all
the
lagunitas
stuff
its
solid
enjoyable
high
quality
and
very
drinkablebut
never
outstanding
or
world
class
imo
ok
hey
gotta
give
them
props
their
beers
always
range
from
good
to
kickass
across
the
board
seems
like
a
low
score
for
this
one
but
no
i
like
it
just
fine
its
totally
solid
but
nothing
that
i
couldnt
live
without
serviceable
i
think
they
say
well
lagunitas
pulled
it
out
on
this
one
great
beer
with
a
very
good
flavor
very
nice
smell
not
that
hoppie
not
that
sweet
just
an
all
around
good
beer
id
have
it
on
more
than
one
occasion
kronic
is
a
very
good
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
californian
beer
with
a
great
flavor
and
very
good
all
around
tast
this
is
the
one
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
this
beer
is
good
but
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
drinkability
very
very
easy
and
smooth
d
its
refreshing
but
for
my
taste
i
couldnt
take
more
than
one
because
of
the
sweetness
notes
i
found
this
delicious
and
utterly
drinkable
but
it
sort
of
plays
to
my
sweet
tooth
the
beer
has
a
pretty
decent
taste
it
is
very
crisp
and
light
but
balanced
this
does
somewhat
make
up
for
the
terrible
head
that
it
poured
with
the
caramel
malt
really
comes
through
and
i
dont
detect
any
bitter
hops
d
really
a
pleasant
sessionable
brew
would
have
no
problem
drinking
and
enjoying
several
of
these
clear
copper
pour
with
offwhite
head
caramel
cinammon
some
dried
fruit
make
up
the
nose
astringent
taste
with
hops
and
grain
up
front
which
is
really
out
of
place
for
a
lagunitas
product
malty
middle
with
caramel
flavors
that
leads
to
the
more
familiar
lagunitas
sweetness
in
the
back
tasty
beer
decent
beer
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
its
thin
well
carbonated
and
lightly
sweet
so
its
an
easy
session
drinker
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
its
really
hard
to
taste
the
hops
not
bad
but
not
overly
memorable
d
thats
a
lot
of
hops
at
the
end
with
a
little
too
much
bitterness
for
my
liking
decent
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
clean
and
dry
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
one
of
these
and
i
grow
weary
d
not
too
good
tastes
and
feels
awkward
as
the
scales
are
tipped
on
the
malty
side
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
as
it
sits
awkwardly
on
the
palate
definitely
had
better
red
ales
notes
a
successful
offering
from
lagunitas
but
nothing
earth
shattering
for
me
i
do
appreciate
the
attention
brought
on
it
by
the
whole
censored
label
and
everything
a
solid
amber
ale
from
lagunitas
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
overall
a
good
beer
if
you
crave
some
malty
goodnessbut
not
a
malt
bomb
d
this
is
a
nice
simple
brew
i
can
see
why
it
was
named
the
kronic
it
is
simple
but
you
want
more
after
every
pull
goes
down
easy
and
the
abv
isnt
noticable
at
all
good
brew
d
this
was
a
damn
fine
brew
and
one
i
would
happily
seek
out
again
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
and
full
of
flavor
very
drinkable
amber
ale
poured
hard
into
a
large
ayinger
glass
dark
copper
color
topped
by
a
large
fluffy
cream
colored
head
and
crystal
clear
smells
of
burnt
toffee
caramel
apple
earthy
hops
pumpernickel
toast
flavors
include
toast
pithy
citrus
lemon
and
caramel
finish
is
bitter
and
slightly
metallic
mouthfeel
is
medium
as
is
the
carbonation
a
fairly
easy
drinking
ale
with
solid
bitterness
i
think
the
metallic
finish
would
get
in
the
way
after
a
while
i
have
enjoyed
some
of
the
hoppy
ales
from
lagu
very
much
this
was
a
bit
of
a
change
of
pace
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
on
tap
the
aroma
was
strongly
malted
with
some
sweetness
the
taste
was
mostly
malt
dominated
again
and
it
seemed
to
leave
an
odd
flavor
on
the
tongue
that
i
could
not
shake
i
powered
it
down
and
left
it
at
that
it
was
nice
carbonated
but
not
high
on
the
food
chain
in
the
amber
category
d
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
would
be
happy
to
do
so
m
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
enough
hop
bite
to
round
out
the
experience
a
very
nice
brew
md
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
easy
drinking
as
well
d
very
drinkable
this
has
become
my
goto
sixpack
when
i
cant
make
up
my
mind
it
usually
fits
the
bill
and
always
tastes
great
and
its
no
problem
to
drink
a
few
in
a
row
a
pleasant
surprise
for
something
as
flavorful
and
thick
drinkabilitythis
was
an
ok
beer
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
d
one
of
the
more
generally
enjoyable
red
ales
ive
had
pretty
easy
to
session
and
not
a
bad
offering
in
a
sea
of
hoppiness
drinkability
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
this
beer
looked
tasty
in
the
glass
great
copper
color
with
small
off
white
head
i
was
surprised
by
the
strong
smell
of
hops
as
i
expected
a
more
subdued
roasted
smell
in
flavor
it
really
comes
off
as
an
ipa
which
i
was
not
expecting
the
alcohol
comes
out
in
the
flavor
more
than
i
expected
even
in
a
beer
the
is
almost
6
it
leaves
a
fantastic
aftertaste
that
shows
off
the
complexities
and
sweetness
that
are
lost
to
the
hops
and
alcohol
during
the
actual
drink
it
goes
down
easy
though
almost
like
flat
soda
overall
this
taste
like
a
nice
easy
ipa
but
for
myself
i
would
choose
something
else
even
if
i
was
looking
for
an
ipa
taste
hop
taste
is
more
subdued
in
the
taste
than
it
was
in
the
smell
almost
tastes
like
someone
blended
an
ipa
with
a
brown
ale
d
definitely
drinkable
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
is
red
seal
and
this
is
close
behind
it
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
copper
color
one
of
the
best
ive
seen
in
a
beer
very
inviting
smell
is
just
average
with
some
hops
and
malts
slightly
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
and
is
well

a
great

oh

the

its

really
like
this
brew
not
sure
what
a
copper
ale
is
but
for
such
a
strong
abv
it
is
pretty
tame
kind
of
dangerous
actually
smooth
and
slightly
caramel
you
dont
much
notice
until
the
tang
at
the
end
like
other
copper
ales
i
have
tried
it
is
kinda

drinkbaility
and
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
not
great
a
little
dissapointing
when
held
against
the
the
other
stuff
from
lagunitas
ive
had
this
is
a
fun
beer
at
best
but
definitly
not
one
to
search
for
my
first
impression
of
this
beer
is
of
course
whats
beneath
the
censored
the
kronic
huh
its
ridiculous
that
has
to
be
censored
anyway
another
story
for
another
time
as
far
as
the
beer
itself
goes
the
presentation
is
awesome
the
head
is
substantial
fluffy
offwhite
and
very
consistent
the
body
is
a
beauty
as
well
amber
with
an
orange
haze
to
it
the
nose
is
sugary
with
hints
of
a
caramel
presence
the
mouthfeel
strikes
me
as
clean
and
wholesome
overall
the
maltiness
is
prevalent
but
there
is
some
nuttiness
lingering
and
its
quite
juicy
really
the
finish
stays
sweet
and
is
a
little
more
grainy
i
suspect
a
hint
of
apple
preceding
a
mouth
coating
dosage
of
subtle
caramel
sweetness
its
a
pretty
good
brew
this
brew
didnt
wow
me
but
is
was
solid
and
could
be
a
nice
session
brew
clear
and
light
chestnut
some
carbonation
seen
rising
with
just
a
tad
of
khaki
head

ring
caramelly
molassess
buttery
and
sugar
very
nice
and
heavythickchewy
aroma
very
full
mouthfeel
smooth
and
sikly
the
carbonation
is
just
barely
noticeable
just
feels
like
it
gently
comes
to
life
in
your
mouth
with
touch
of
foam
bite
of
hoppy
pepperyness
with
a
bit
of
caramel

flavor
nice
darkened
toast
taste
with
grapefruit
rind
flavors
are
left
in
your
mouth
at
the
end
of
the
sip
for
a
good
while
catching
a
bit
of

bit
of
orange
peel
maybe
clementines
in
the
flavor
very
drinkable
nice
session
a
lot
of
good
flavor
and
feel
without
being
too
intense
too
compete
with
a
good
meal
nah
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
brown
but
my
first
taste
was
somewhat
sour
notable
hops
but
very
little
else
to
recommend
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
a
decent
session
brew
but
its
limited
complexity
has
me
looking
elswhere
for
my
weekend
sixpack
interesting
bottle
with
the
word
censored
written
across
the
front
blocking
something
out
poured
out
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
cream
colored
head
a
bubbly
webbing
of
lace
was
left
around
the
glass
caramel
malt
with
some
earthy
hops
made
up
most
of
the
nose
a
bit
of
doughy
malt
but
mostly
sweetness
taste
was
similar
with
a
strong
sweet
caramel
being
the
main
component
some
earthy
spicy
hops
are
lurking
in
the
back
as
well
as
biscuit
and
some
roastiness
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
in
my
opinion
medium
and
smooth
this
goes
down
easily
and
is
tasty
enough
i
would
have
had
another
something
interesting
enough
i
would
try
again
drinkability
sorry
but
i
didnt
much
care
for
this
one
the
sweetness
just
made
it
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
take
pours
a
lightly
hazy
ruby
copper
color
that
is
topped
by
a
light
brown
one
finger
thick
head
that
the
aroma
is
thick
with
crystal
malt
a
bit
of
candy
sweetness
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
herbal
perhaps
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
stays
that
way
as
it
finishes
with
a
heavy
handed
crystal
malt
caramel
notes
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
helps
to
balance
this
malt
dominated
brew
this
beer
has
a
medium
full
body
contributed
by
the
malt
the
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
bit
simplistic
though
admittedly
this
is
a
pretty
weak
problem
this
beer
is
pretty
straight
forward
and
i
almost
think
that
a
beer
with
this
many
malt
caramel
notes
would
more
fittingly
be
a
low
alcohol
session
brew
this
could
pass
for
an
ipa
any
day
of
the
week
appearance
aroma
and
tast
all
fit
the
bill
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
a
medium
body
brew
with
an
ideal
amount
of
fizz
this
is
a
good
beer
despite
the
higher
abv
i
would
drink
this
a
plenty
would
go
well
shooting
pool
and
other
drug
lordz
yo
lagunitas
reprazent
if
this
wasnt
7
7
abv
it
would
make
very
excellent
session
beer
as
it
is
oh
so
easy
to
drink
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
a
hoppy
flavor
of
pine
and
grapefruit
begins
each
sip
some
caramel
malt
is
hidden
in
the
background
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
with
a
dry
finish
is
found
at
the
end
leaving
some
citrus
and
alcohol
notes
behind
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
the
clear
amber
brew
head
lasts
reasonably
well
but
shows
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
deeply
of
malts
husks
with
some
light
hops
presence
taste
follows
the
nose
to
a
t
with
the
solid
grain
husks
giving
way
to
a
slight
sourness
and
then
quickly
switching
a
slight
hops
crispness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
especially
for
such
a
strong
abv
brew
check
this
one
out
this
is
a
pretty
sexy
looking
ale
a
chillhazed
fruity
copper
which
increases
in
chroma
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
top
quick
someone
take
a
picture
the
head
is
thin
and
offwhite
however
poor
retention
the
aroma
is
rich
and
full
caramel
and
toasted
malts
dates
and
currents
some
citrus
along
with
a
full
boquet
of
hops
it
all
blends
and
balances
out
so
nicely
the
flavour
is
not
as
action
packed
in
the
beginning
subdued
malt
and
dried
fruit
carried
along
by
a
full
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
can
be
felt
but
not
tasted
as
much
things
pick
up
towards
the
end
everything
slowly
surfaces
at
once
sweet
buttery
malt
meaty
dried
fruit
with
citrusy
hops
that
go
herbal
on
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
smooth
mouthfeel
light
flavour
but
it
loses
me
in
the
flavour
department
a
bit
is
lacking
in
more
character
to
make
it
memorable
to
leave
an
impression
a
wallflower
when
it
should
be
out
there
breakdancing
it
has
all
the
right
moves
it
just
doesnt
utilize
them
to
their
fullest
if
it
were
less
shy
this
would
be
an
excellent
strong
ale
perhaps
the
ganja
has
mellowed
it
out
a
little
too
much
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
thin
tan
head
fuity
hop
smelling
with
a
significant
amount
of
maltiness
as
well
caramlel
and
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
yeasty
biscuit
very
well
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
maltiness
to
back
up
the
citric
hops
the
caramel
comes
through
with
a
slight
amount
of
fig
and
brown
sugar
to
back
it
up
it
has
a
well
carbonated
medium
body
very
drinkable
lots
of
flavors
none
over
powering
it
would
be
easy
to
sip
these
all
night
medium
bodied
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
aftertaste
has
caramel
and
pine
lasting
briefly
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
great
beer
from
out
west
ive
recently
noticed
this
company
more
and
more
out
here
in
mass
i
think
they
must
be
doing
well
for
themselves
the
moan
and
dove
seems
to
frequently
have
a
keg
of
theirs
on
tap
and
the
better
beer
stores
around
here
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
their
sixers
now
which
they
didnt
about
6
months
ago
im
glad
because
i
like
this
stuff
pours
a
nice
dark
rich
copper
color
as
suggested
on
the
label
with
a
little
tan
bubbly
head
smell
is
great
and
complex
swirls
of
sweet
carmely
malts
and
fruity
piney
hops
combine
here
to
create
a
great
scent
the
taste
just
screams
balance
malty
up
front
with
notes
of
carmel
vanilla
other
sweetness
followed
by
a
great
bitter
hop
ass
kicking
fruity
and
floral
like
a
pale
ale
too
smooth
even
mouthfeel
and
super
easy
and
pleasureful
to
put
back
ill
definately
be
getting
this
stuff
again
what
a
great
beer
this
is
a
top
notch
session
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
amber
hints
the
head
is
off
beat
tan
with
great
retention
the
smell
is
of
lemons
and
pine
the
caramel
malts
seem
well
done
the
flavors
intertwine
into
a
great
symphony
the
taste
is
exceptional
with
every
taste
you
will
pick
up
flavors
the
floralcitrus
hops
in
the
taste
get
attacked
right
away
by
deep
roasted
caramel
malts
the
flavors
are
perfect
perhaps
my
favorite
session
beer
goes
good
with
meats
burnt
sienna
in
color
with
very
little
head
disapeared
so
quickly
i
couldnt
even
tell
you
what
color
it
was
from
the
tiny
bit
floating
on
top
i
would
guess
white
like
soap
bubbles
pungent
almost
pumpkinish
smell
i
dont
think
pumpkin
is
right
but
i
cant
place
the
smell
even
though
i
just
sniffed
it
for
a
good
5
minutes
trying
to
figure
out
what
it
reminded
me
of
when
i
asked
my
dad
he
said
beer
ubersmooth
with
malty
caramel
taste
dont
expect
a
typical
lagunitas
hop
punch
with
this
one
no
pumpkin
taste
but
i
cant
match
that
smell
up
with
any
of
the
tastes
in
there
did
i
read
this
had
7
alcohol
cant
tate
it
as
it
warms
up
slight
chocolate
taste
hints
through
very
smooth
almost
no
carbonation
but
blends
well
very
drinkable
for
a
bigger
beer
almost
dangerously
so
but
not
complex
enough
to
make
you
want
to
come
back
for
a
second
one
right
away
in
an
attempt
to
understand
it
like
the
bottle
says
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
an
slightly
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
awhile
i
was
also
suprised
by
the
higher
carbonation
level
wich
i
wasn
expecting
wow
alot
of
difeerent
melding
aromas
going
on
somecaramel
and
butter
toffee
with
a
nice
underlying
piney
hop
that
made
this
very
delectable
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
big
and
sweet
up
front
but
man
do
the
hops
come
in
to
dry
this
out
just
enough
to
make
a
perfect
balancecaramel
and
roasted
nuts
turn
into
pine
and
grapefruit
in
the
finish
now
this
was
a
joy
to
drink

and
flavorfuli
will
buy
again
in
the
future
deep
amber
to
copper
color
i
know
its
known
as
a
copper
ale
but
to
me
this
was
more
amber
thick
dense
off
white
head
leaves
a
light
sheet
of
lace
as
i
drink
the
beer
the
aroma
has
a
great
fruity
hop
aroma
grapefruit
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
pine
the
hops
share
aroma
with
some
of
the
malt
character
maybe
ribbon
candy
or
figs
nice
malt
aroma
the
taste
has
more
malt
up
front
than
i
expected
a
rich
character
that
i
would
associate
more
with
a
dark
lager
than
an
ale
very
pleasing
with
a
thick
mouth
feel
the
hops
show
up
on
the
finish
with
a
cleansing
bitterness
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
was
expecting
more
hops
but
am
surprised
and
impressed
by
the
depth
and
strength
of
the
malt
in
this
beer
notes
the
nose
is
better
than
the
taste
with
this
brew
this
beer
comes
courtesy
of
clvand0
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
coat
of
head
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
caramel
orange
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
some
hop
bitters
in
there
the
flavor
is
full
on
caramel
with
a
nice
hop
to
balance
it
out
on
the
finish
not
bad
at
all
the
feel
is
moderate
and
smooth
with
a
light
carb
that
makes
things
flow
nicely
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
on
this
beer
its
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
more
of
the
biscuit
comes
through
as
it
warms
but
it
still
has
a
nice
balance
good
beer
tried
my
first
bottle
of
this
last
night
its
somewhat
of
a
treat
because
we
cant
get
lagunitas
in
ky
i
like
the
idea
behind
the
name
pours
a
slightly
dark
amber
color
with
a
tall
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
leaves
tons
of
lumpy
lacing
on
the
glass
i
actually
couldnt
just
rinse
the
lace
off
after
drinking
had
to
actually
wipe
it
the
aroma
had
caramel
malts
with
some
citrus
and
pine
hops
very
pleasing
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
very
strong
caramel
backbone
but
it
is
not
overpowering
the
hops
come
through
well
citrus
and
pine
mostly
this
is
exceptionally
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
as
it
has
a
very
thick
body
i
respect
a
copper
ale
thats
not
thin
drinkability
is
great
as
well
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
ambercopper
ales
ive
had
drinkability
i
used
to
like
this
a
lot
more
than
i
do
now
just
too
sweet
for
me
overall
an
interesting
beer
its
different
from
anything
else
ive
had
im
not
quite
sure
if
i
really
like
it
or
not
very
well
balanced
overall
and
dangerously
drinkable
the
abv
is
cleverly
disguised
an
excellent
american
strong
ale
censored
initially
struck
me
as
somewhat
of
a
letdown
once
i
recalibrated
however
i
was
able
to
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
namely
a
drinkable
strong
ale
that
is
unthreatening
enough
for
all
comers
to
enjoy
it
is
coming
into
its
own
with
warming
and
im
enjoying
the
bottom
half
of
the
bottle
more
than
the
top
half
or
maybe
its
the
7
7
abv
talking
bottle
a
bit
too
tinny
for
me
the
hops
are
there
and
all
that
piney
grapefruity
flavour
rusty
bitterness
not
round
enough
edgey
in
flavour
had
the
same
characters
as
all
the
other
lagunitas
beers
i
had
different
ingredients
of
course
but
still
this
rough
rusted
tin
edge
comes
through
as
it
does
their
other
beers
drank
some
of
this
controversial
brew
whilst
visiting
my
brother
in
palo
alto
pours
a
medium
golden
copper
with
a
dense

of
rich
caramelly

and

starts
off
with
chewy

with
some

spicy

kick
in
and
are
plenty
bitter
alcoholic
and
warmingalmost
medicinal
a
tad
too
alcoholic
tasting
otherwise
a
solid
strong
ale
another
nice
beer
from
lagunitas
they
may
not
do
fantastic
beers
but
they
do
good
beers

could
use
some
more

imho
this
copper
colored
brew
poured
a
nice
head
that
left
a
residual
stickiness
on
my
pint
smell
was
nothing
remarkable
the
taste
was
good
i
was
shocked
to
see
how
high
the
abv
was
i
figured
it
would
have
been
in
the
mid
5s
range
mouthfeel
was
nice
simewhat
full
for
a
copper
and
definitely
lively
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
was
crafted
very
well
my
lord
this
is
a
scary
ass
tasty
beer
i
am
stunned
that
the
ratings
are
not
higher
because
it
is
awesome
pours
a
beautiful
copper
color
rich
malty
aroma
with
an
orange
twang
lightly
sweet
malty
flavor
with
some
grainy
edginess
and
citric
hops
to
balance
rich
and
full
body
you
would
never
guess
the
alcohol
contentno
wonder
they
call
it
the
kronic
fabulous
slightly
hazed
copper
tone
thin
off
white
head
lace
comes
in
not
so
frequent
rings
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
a
little
bready
as
well
the
first
thing
i
notice
on
the
palate
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
base
sweet
and
malty
the
hops
balance
but
really
dont
add
a
lot
of
flavor
or
bitterness
maybe
theres
a
shimmer
of
spiciness
coming
from
them
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
the
body
is
damn
near
full
and
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
pretty
solid
amber
overall
i
would
drop
8
for
a
six
pack
of
this
every
now
and
then
if
it
was
available
here
all
in
all
a
bit
of
a
rough
beer
but
not
bad
if
youre
a
consenting
adult
and
into
that
sort
of
thing
a
rich
copper
with
good
head
and
lace
aroma
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
beer
begins
with
sweet
malts
with
quite
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
flavor
some
maple
syrup
a
very
slight
roastiness
and
smokiness
is
apparent
but
it
is
way
down
deep
down
in
there
the
hops
come
along
with
bright
pine
flavors
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
too
sweet
the
alcohol
mostly
invisible
flavorwise
but
there
is
definitely
some
spiciness
happening
here
the
yeast
adds
a
rich
buttery
element
that
works
nicely
with
the
malts
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
with
a
slight
prickliness
this
is
a
fine
healthy
brew
but
like
lagunitas
other
strong
beers
i
have
to
question
why
this
has
so
much
alcohol
to
my
tastes
it
only
serves
to
mask
the
flavor
somewhat
its
like
a
blurry
lens
over
the
beer
otherwise
this
is
a
good
rich
tasting
red
ale
with
an
interesting
and
pleasing
amount
of
hoppiness
i
suppose
one
could
give
this
strong
beer
good
scores
for
drinkability
but
i
have
chosen
not
to
because
i
found
the
first
sip
to
be
the
besttasting
and
each
subsequent
sip
not
quite
as
good
the
kronic
did
that
really
have
to
be
censored
guys
is
something
of
a
paradoxits
a
simultaniously
a
success
and
a
failure
theyve
succeeded
in
making
a
remarkably
mild
middleoftheroad
high
abv
amberyoud
swear
it
was
just
another
pale
ale
however
its
just
another
pale
ale
theyve
done
nothing
interesting
or
novel
with
all
the
malt
and
alcohol
my
thinking
is
that
if
youre
going
big
go
all
the
way
nice
but
not
special
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
last
weekend
and
shared
it
with
a
couple
of
friends
after
a
local
10k
race
i
liked
it
so
much
initialy
i
went
back
and
got
a
6er
for
myself
to
conduct
a
thorough
eval
poured
a
glorious
coppery
color
into
my
chalice
with
about
2
12
fingers
of
fluffy
cloudlike
head
which
took
several
minutes
to
dissipate
leaving
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
fresh
breadcaramel
with
a
hint
of
fruity
banana
i
tried
to
find
some
of
the
7
7
abv
but
it
just
wasnt
there
scary
taste
was
initially
going
towards
sweet
caramel
but
the
30
or
so
i
b
u
s
mellowed
the
sweetness
to
a
glorious
mild
bitterness
i
must
admit
i
am
a
hophead
who
loves
it
bitter
but
this
was
a
very
smooth
drinkable
ever
so
tastey
offering
from
lagunitas
mouthfeel
was
just
right
with
a
mild
carbonation
and
creamy
buttery
smooth
finish
tastes
like
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
but
the
7
7
is
there
so
be
forewarned
i
love
lagunitas
this
is
one
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
for
awhile
and
i
just
got
around
to
it
the
beer
poured
a
nice
burnt
orangecopper
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
settled
into
a
small
layer
of
head
that
left
great
spider
web
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
did
not
impress
that
much
with
a
pretty
earthy
malt
scent
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
quite
simple
with
a
great
malt
profile
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
the
malt
is
not
overly
sweet
so
it
tends
to
balance
out
slight
carmel
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
excelent
on
this
one
though
very
smoothe
and
crisp
and
very
drinkable
the
7
7
cannot
be
tasted
at
all
but
can
for
sure
be
felt
so
i
think
this
one
would
make
a
very
good
session
beer
by
flavor
but
the
session
would
not
last
that
long
good
stuff
though
12
ounce
bottle
notes
i
love
lagunitas
note
this
one
is
complex
and
balanced
and
hides
its
abv
very
well
one
might
mistake
this
for
a
session
beer
but
that
could
turn
into
a
dangerous
one
very
good
beer

it
more
of
a

delightful

the
first
sip
was
very
appealing
but
then
subsequent
sips
hit
me
as
a
little
overthetop
on
the
flavor
thats
a
good
flavor
mind
you
theres
just
a
lot
of
it
in
there
i
dont
think
id
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
this
brew
is
a
dark
reddishcopper
colour
with
a
tight
head
of
snowy
white
foam
the
aromas
are
subtle
but
chock
full
of

the
taste
is
robust
and
satisfying
starting
with
a
sweet
maltiness
up
front
and
ending
with
some
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
a

chewy

nice
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a

i
would
have
though
very
sweet
and
caramelly
malty
smells
highly
of
alcohol
beer
is
thick
and
definitely
was
sweet
but
i
dont
think
it
holds
up
to
the
smell
less
bold
than
i
predicted
the
ops
are
subdoed
but
come
poking
out
arbitrarily
in
the
flavor
making
for
an
overall
nice
herterogenous

is
finished
off
by
a

like
citric
acidity
which
i
dont
believe
fits
very
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
overall
im
quite
pleased
but
mostly
with
the
smell
you
wouldnt
guess
the
kronic
has
a
7
7
abv
its
very
well
disguised
as
such
its
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
but
not
one
id
use
as
a
session
beer
not
a
real
complex
beer
but
still
possessing
enough
vitality
and
diversity
of
flavors
to
warrant
giving
it
a
try
notes
tasty
to
be
sure
but
the
flavor
profile
is
a
tad
hohum
in
my
opinion
to
warrant
a
7
7
abv
drinkablilty
overall
nice
would
be
a
great
session
beer
if
it
had
some
more
body
and
at
least
some
finish
to
it
needs
some
refinement
to
truly
be
an
above
average
brew
drinkability

i
could
easily
get
trashed
on
this
stuff
it
went
down
extremely
well
and
failed
to
warn
of
the
rather
hefty
abv
i
decided
to
try
this
one
after
it
beat
out
some
pretty
choice
beers
in
a
blind
taste
test
a
co
worker
of
mine
conducted
with
himself
i
was
not
completely
impressed
with
the
appearance
as
the
head
retention
was
poor
and
lacing
was
almost
non
existent
the
deep
ambercopper
color
though
was
appealing
aroma
was
fresh
bready
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
a
very
nice
nose
indeed
smooth
did
i
say
smooth
taste
very
nice
and
tilted
towards
the
caramel
malt
with
a
alanced
but
back
seat
hoppiness
very
drinkable
and
could
be
one
of
the
top
ambers
i
have
had
might
have
to
do
my
own
taste
test
soon
suzanne
liked
it
too
upon
trying
a
second
bottle
said
sample
had
a
nice
head
and
left
good
lacing
so
i
upped
its
appearance
a
bit
dark
copper
color
medium
to
large
head
a
medium
bodied
ale
most
reminiscent
of
a
amber
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
the
malt
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
slight
hop
spiciness
full
flavored
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
malty
with
a
slight
residual
bitterness
refreshing
very
nice
beer
the
brew
has
a
nice
copper
amber
color
with
a
light
amount
of
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
fade
the
smell
is
lightly
hopped
and
mildly
fruity
intising
you
to
try
it
the
taste
is
slightly
fruity
but
not
overpowering
after
a
couple
sips
the
true
undertones
in
the
flavors
come
out
revealing
some
honey
and
cherry
type
flavors
probably
also
with
a
bit
of
caramel
overall
very
drinkable
and
worth
checking
out

i
agree
w
beerdedbastard
that
the
nose
is
like
an
ice
tea
mix
it
is
a
hoppy
beer
but
well
balanced
the

in

calculated

bitterness
and
a

acidic
twang
pronounced
lingering
tang
of
salty
biscuit
emerges
mid
palate
along
with
a
mellow

combination
the

lends
a
crisp

smooth
mouthfeel
that
belies
the

content
finishes
mostly
clean
with
fleeting
bready

yielding
to
soft

the
kronic
is
an
odd

brew
not

but
dangerously
balanced
and
well
brewed
easily
as
drinkable
as
insipid
american
ambers
of

there
is
absolutely
no

it

40
of
this
in
a
brown
paper
sack
and
im
good
to
go
the
pour
is
a
slightly
cloudy
reddish
orange
with
a
grandiose
head
that
dissipates
to
fine
sheets
of
sticky
lace
that
clings
mightily
to
the
glass
a
nice
floral
tone
up
front
with
malt
and
a
butter
like
aromas
also
present
clean
and
fresh
with
a
malt
sweet
start
that
leads
to
the
middling
top
the
beer
finishes
with
a
planetary
hop
bite
prickly
in
its
acidity
dry
lingering
aftertaste
id
call
it
a
hop
heads
delight
and
i
must
say
lagunitas
is
a
fine
brewery
with
a
great
line
of
beers
that
also
inhabit
my
stable
clear
deep
amberred
with
copper
highlights
full
foamy
cream
colored
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
leaves
some
really
nice
lace
very
nice
lightly
fruity
malty
and
hoppy
aroma
its
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
really
nice
creaminess
in
the
mouth
theres
some
lightly
fruity
sweetish
caramel
malt
up
front
even
lightly
toasty
becoming
creamier
and
more
mellow
as
it
crosses
the
palate
revealing
some
nice
floral
grassy
hop
flavor
it
finishes
with
a
good
blend
of
sweet
malt
and
light
hop
flavor
amongst
a
gentle
earthy
bitter
dryness
kind
of
herbal
in
a
way
the
alcohol
is
very
well
cloaked
this
is
an
exceptionally
well
balanced
and
well
brewed
beer
especially
considering
its
original
gravity
and
strength
full
flavored
but
not
overwhelming
as
might
be
expected
its
not
complex
but
has
a
rich
characeter
thats
very
drinkable
exceptionally
enjoyable
this
review
will
be
censored
free
the
kronic
had
a
decent
head
on
the
pour
but
settled
rather
quickly
there
was
still
a
little
there
but
not
enough
to
even
tickle
your
nose
the
kronic
is
dark
copper
in
color
the
kronic
isnt
a
very
hoppy
beer
so
hopheads
will
be
disappointed
in
that
but
dont
get
me
wrong
the
kronic
is
malty
and
a
wonderful
tasting
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
white
head
good
hop
kick
with
some
nice
sweetness
underneath
as
the
beer
warmed
i
found
some
nutty
and
toasted
flavors
balanced
toward
the
hoppy
side
a
good
solid
beer
pours
copper
as
the
name
would
indicate
with
a
light
brown
head
it
has
a
delicate
hop
aroma
with
some
metallic
smell
despite
a
nice
malty
background
and
a
nice
amount
of
hops
the
metallic
taste
was
just
a
bit
offputting
overall
its
very
mellow
and
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
its

it
is
all

citrusygrapefruit
coming
right
out
of

but
as
the
glass
warms
it
starts
to
balance
out
as
the
caramel
malts
come
through
nice
body
to
it
with
good

another
great
one
from
lagunitas
best
beer
i
have
ever
enjoyed
great
everythiing
overall
im
glad
i
didnt
throw
these
cute
bottles
out
i
didnt
really
like
it
fresh
but
damn
age
does
this
brew
wonders
fresh
i
wouldve
given
this
brew
a
3
2
and
i
love
amberred
ales
im
looking
forward
to
the
rest
i
have
saved
this
brew
is
worthy
o
sweet
and
oaky
with
some
mild
bitter
hops
ok
overall
hmm
looks
smells
and
drinks
like
a
barleywine
more
than
anything
and
well
isnt
that
basically
what
it
is
maybe
it
was
more
hoppy
back
in
october
but
whatever
was
there
is
mostly
gone
by
now
whats
left
is
good
and
certainly
drinkable
but
its
more
malty
than
hoppy
these
days
regardless
a
hell
of
a
beer
overall
while
the
hoppy
in
the
name
was
never
really
delivered
to
a
full
extent
the
boozy
fruity
and
oak
were
very
much
big
and
monstrous
but
in
a
rather
nice
way
overall
it
is
big
malty
and
boozy
with
lots
of
oak
flavors
which
makes
for
a
rather
nice
slow
sipper
super
delisious
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
taste
there
is
this
wonderful
buttery
and
oaky
woodiness
that
plays
fantastically
with
the
hearty
heavy
warming
amber
red
and
caramel
malt
base
of
the
beer
these
both
blend
with
a
certain
oily
bitterness
of
the
hops
that
although
is
surprisingly
light
cant
easily
be
shaken
free
the
oak
is
also
nicely
representative
in
the
nose
but
here
the
hops
are
very
very
hard
to
discern
making
it
a
bit
of
a
surprise
that
they
are
found
in
the
flavoring
at
all
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
youve
got
to
be
a
fan
of
a
beer
with
an
intensely
malty
base
big
wood
and
a
lightness
of
hops
while
it
doesnt
improve
upon
or
change
the
rules
of
the
style
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
find
and
an
interesting
review
deep
orange
amber
body
was
a
little
cloudy
the
barrel
aging
seems
to
have
taken
out
some
of
the
fizz
as
the
beer
was
lightly
carbonated
and
the
head
was
less
than
one
finger
thick
and
faded
rapidly
the
smell
was
very
typical
ipa
at
first
sniff
with
pine
resin
being
prevalent
deeper
breaths
indicated
more
of
the
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
toffee
from
the
wood
tannin
influence
taste
was
a
lot
more
mellow
than
i
remember
the
regular
bhm
to
be
there
were
clearly
a
lot
of
hops
but
they
had
melded
much
better
with
the
sweeter
flavors
emerging
from
the
liquid
touching
oak
barrels
there
was
some
brown
sugar
vanilla
raisins
and
butterscotch
flavors
coming
right
behind
the
spicy
hops
the
finish
revealed
more
of
the
dry
oak
driven
tannin
tastes
the
finish
finished
quite
dry
and
sawdust
like
a
little
thinner
than
the
regular
monster
across
the
tongue
i
usually
am
not
a
big
fan
of
oak
aging
but
terrapin
seems
to
have
used
the
emerging
characteristics
to
enhance
than
overpower
the
original
beers
characteristics
the
result
is
rounder
mellower
and
more
pleasing
really
liked
this
one
totally
different
than
anything
ive
had
before
o
the
oak
taste
is
strong
so
are
dark
stone
fruit
flavors
d
really
not
a
desirable
brew
for
me
too
much
wood
not
enough
malt
and
hops
to
provide
balance
not
all
beers
should
be
put
in
oak
i
actually
get
no
hops
dont
think
ill
be
trying
this
one
again
poured
into
a
sterilized
glass
not
much
smell
to
it
however
the
color
is
a
beautiful
midbrown
with
transparency
and
thickness
that
reminded
me
of
iced
tea
sweet
hops
slightly
citrusy
great
wood
oak
flavor
that
takes
over
i
agree
with
other
fans
of
this
beer
that
i
taste
bourbon
as
well
overall
well
ive
taken
a
liking
to
red
ipas
over
the
last
few
weeks
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
terrapin
did
a
really
nice
job
covering
up
the
alcohol
bite
considering
an
abv
that
almost
hits
11
this
is
a
beer
you
need
to
sip
on
and
not
race
to
finish
despite
the
name
the
one
thing
i
will
argue
that
this
is
not
by
any
means
a
big
hoppy
monster
of
a
beer
haha
if
this
beer
where
named
perhaps

it
slowly

would

again
probably
this
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
willing
to
try
a

a

great
beers
are

hard
to
find
something
wrong
and
you
cant
while
at
the
same
time
you
might
not
be
able
to
point
out
exactly
what
you
like
about
but
you
do
this
beer
falls
into
that
category
if
i
had
a
gun
to
my
head
i
would
say
it
had
a
kind
of
flat
finish
but
that
is
outweighed
by
the
initial
feel
or
sneaky
hoppy
rush

colored

judiciously
used

the

the
hops
seem
more
piney
tasting
than

the

is
moderately
carbonated

overall
fairly
light
for
the
style
overall
a
pleasant
hoppy

is
nicely
tied

even

really
awesome
representation
of
the

once

odell
impresses
me
with
their
ipa
game
highly
recommend
this
one
to
fans
of
ipas
looking
for
something
just
a
little
bit
different
from
your
normal
ipa
overall
odell
makes
a
lot
of
good
beers
this
one
is
another
solid
one
nice
balanced
ipa
with
a
little
more
heft
than
i
was
expecting
worth
a
shot
pretty
awesome
ipa
nice
amount
of
hops
flavor
and
alcohol
this
beer
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
a
red
ipa
not
superhoppy
thanks
to
the
malty
balance
of
the
red
but
definitely
not
just
your
standard
red
the
color
is
a
nice
dark
mahogany
again
not
quite
your
normal
red
theres
a
lot
of
lace
on
this
one
too
this
is
a
winterspring
seasonal
and
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
even
though
its
not
my
favorite
beer
style
ill
try
anything
from
odell
and
this
is
no
exception
beautiful
looking
beer
deep
amber
color
with
great
clarity
and
lacing
with
afluffy
head
sticky
sweet
malt
profile
with
heavy
floral
notes
and
a
toasty
oat
finish
this
brew
is
an
amber
color
clearmand
capped
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
a
blend
of
malt
and
musty
hops
nice
balance
caramel
and
bread
peppery
hops
lingering
bitter
finish
it
has
a
firm
and
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
fine
amber
ipa
while
certainly
not
an
especially
aggressive
beer
nor
acutely
expressive
of
its
specific
ingredients
it
does
seem
pretty
expertly
expressive
of
the
nuanced
season
when
a
somber
quickening
burdens
each
snowfall
with
the
steady
implications
of
spring
hops
and
pine
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
it
but
its
still
just
too
hoppy
for
me
pours
a
nice
reddish
color
with
offwhite
head
pine
malts
and
citrus
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
note
pours
a
lovely
deep
clear
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
aroma
is
of
toast
and
citrus
notes
good
hop
presence
slightly
bitter
then
caramel
malt
notes
dominate
followed
by
good
hop
bitterness
and
floral
notes
finishes
dry
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
end
very
nice
beer
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
otherwise
excellent
by
all
standards
pours
clear
red
color
with
a
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
has
a
piney
grapefruit
aroma
big
floral
notes
maybe
some
apple
nice
smooth
malt
to
hop
transition
resin
maybe
some
apple
taste
at
the
end
can
detect
some
caramel
it
is
seems
to
have
the
right
amount
of
malt
to
hops
for
me
good
beer
would
definitely
purchase
again
overall
easy
drinking
but
substantial
tastes
like
a
hoppy
red
should
doesnt
do
anything
that
really
grabs
your
attention
in
fact
one
might
think
it
a
little
muted
but
in
fact
there
is
a
great
balance
and
subtlety
that
over
the
course
of
one
or
two
really
pleases
overall
a
very
pleasant
ipa
all
around
more
balanced
than
is
typical
without
too
much
sweetness
the
hops
is
nicely
presented
without
too
much
bitterness
would
definitely
buy
again
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
not
as
dank
and
resinous
as
some
red
ipas
ive
had
but
this
is
more
fresh
and
lively
instead
well
balanced
another
winner
from
odell
you
have
to
have
it
if
you
appreciate
reds
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
its
a
pretty
clean
clear
beer
in
the
glass
medium
body
at
first
smell
its
mostly
citrus
and
hops
that
hit
you
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
caramel
grapefruit
and
blood
orange
hints
here
finish
is
incredibly
smooth
not
too
bitter
very
good
seasonal
release
from
odell
a
nice
standout
hopefully
it
taste
the
same
next
year
overall
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
red
ipa
and
not
an
amber
ale
recommended
for
all
hop
heads
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
offering
from
odell
i
love
how
tropical
it
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
not
be
very
bitter
very
drinkable
overall
another
fine
offering
from
odells
not
a
great
ipa
but
a
great
red
ale
o
a
pretty
stellar
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
one
regularly
a
very
nice
hopped
up
red
thats
approachable

easy

really
nice
beer
from

and
one
that
i
would
have

there
is
enough
going

the

of

i
used
to
have
when
i
was
a
kid
in

words
it
has
a
very
fruity
smell
i
had
taken
it
out
of
the
fridge
and
poured
it
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
biscuity
and
toasty
malt
sweetness
giving
way
to
quite
a
wallop
of
citrusy
grapefruit
and
orange
and
piney
hop
bitterness
a

amount
of

is
augmented
by

more
of

than
an

definitely
palatable
just
the

just

is

a

nice

this

is
doing

rebuy
in

if
i
am
feeling
red
the

better

yes
amber
in

this

good

deeply
hoppy
complexed

are
not

citric

piney

kinda

lives
up
to
every
one
of

ibus
a
hint
of

from

but
not
a

i

what
10
bucks
4
beers
good
luck
finishing
all
4
3
and
i
was
satisfied
not
many
beers
can
do
that
i
love
satisfaction
and
this
beer
delivers
big
on
malt
flavors
and
big
on
bitterness
this
beer
packs
a
lot
of
punch
it
seems
a
bit
overdone
and
it
affects
the
drinkability
but
theres
still
enough
good
flavor
to
enjoy
this
beer
from
time
to
time
this
is
the
amber
that
taught
me
to
appreciate

style

this

this
beer
was

sweet
but
not
a
malt
bomb
sweet
more
of
a
caramel
or
raisin
sweet

very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
needs
to
be
on
my
buy
again
list
overall
pretty
good
red
ipa
but
not
enough
to
call
it
a
double
o
just
as
good
as
i
remember
but
im
not
sure
how
often
ill
buy
it
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
amber
to
ruby
with
a
tan
rocky
one
finger
head
the
aroma
is
light
with
notes
of
grapefruit
pine
and
salty
sweet
caramel
malt
although
this
has
an
excellent
balance
of
hops
and
malt
it
is
generally
maltforward
as
an
amber
should
be
the
hops
dont
remain
throughout
giving
way
to
the
aforementioned
salty
sweet
caramel
malt
that
dominates
to
the
dry
finish
this
beer
has
some
of
the
best
malt
flavor
of
any
i
have
tried
however
the
hops
as
well
as
the
overall
flavor
tend
to
diminish
as
it
warms
which
lowers
the
score
a
bit
for
me
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
red
ale
poured
into
a
snifter
it
is
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
long
lasting
head
smell
is
mostly
floral
had
a
nice
lingering
pine
and
caramel
flavor
along
with
a
little
citrus
tang
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
would
get
again
pours
hazy
amber
red
tint
and
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
floralcitrusy
nose
with
caramel
malts
grassypine
grapefruit
up
front
resinous
pine
throughout
medium
heavy
body
a
little
spicy
taste
fades
to
sticky
hop
resin
in
the
aftertaste
a
decent
brew
but
in
my
opinion
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
red
ale
unfortunately
i
lost
my
early
review
where
i
took
notes
before
green
flash
had
played
with
the
recipe
the
beer
still
has
a
lot
of
the
same
qualities
crisp
bold
hop
presence
citrus
notes
nutty
rye
and
a
sweetbread
balance
but
with
the
ampedup
abv
and
bigger
maltbackbone
albeit
more
hops
as
well
theres
a
cloying
molasses
aspect
that
make
this
brew
much
less
drinkable
with
all
of
the
big
hoppy
beers
out
there
it
seems
unnecessary
for
green
flash
to
mess
with
a
classic
maybe
it
was
to
make
a
clear
line
of
demarcation
between
their
big
beers
and
their
tasty
session
brews
either
way
this
just
isnt
as
tasty
oh
well
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
by
the
beer
it
wasnt
a
hop
head
beer
in
my
opinion
and
it
wasnt
that
great
of
a
red
ale
either
very
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
amarillo
flavor
and
aroma
i
would
skip
this
one
overall
i
like
plenty
of
hops
and
enough
malts
to
match
them
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
aroma
is
good
although
it
doesnt
steal
the
show
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
pours
dark
red
with
white
head
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
and
caramel
malt
and
ripe
fruit
body
is
full
and
tangy
a
lot
of
citrusy
herbal
hops
caramel
malt
sherry
and
alcohol
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
hoppy
great
brew

this
beer
makes
me
want
a
different
type
of
beer
never
been
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
is
really
enjoyed
overall
a
good
brew
from
green
flash
a
classic
everyone
should
try
overall
this
beer
has
the
basics
of
something
good
but
is
just
missing
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
i
would
love
to
have
some
more
malt
and
hop
flavors
come
through
and
the
bitterness
toned
down
the
mix
of
sweeter
malt
and
resinous
bitterness
doesnt
work
for
me
or
at
least
it
rarely
does
and
this
is
no
exception
this
beer
isnt
a
surprise
given
its
a
green
flash
beer
so
if
you
like
their
stuff
this
could
work
for
you
reddish
hue
great
head
but
lacking
in
a
aroma
or
flavor
red
is
a
good
description
nice
red
color
and
good
hop
flavor
excellent
hoppy
flavor
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
understanding
what
the
brewers
were
trying
to
accomplish
i
give
them
a
standing
ovation
good
show

0z
bottle
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
let
me
explain
i
had
this
beer
at
the
yardhouse
about
3
weeks
ago
and
i
liked
it
so
much
i
wanted
to
wait
and
drink
it
again
before
i
wrote
a
review
well
i
got
to
say
that
this
is
a
great
hoppy
red
ale
at
8
1abv
it
will
get
the
job
gone
in
more
ways
than
one
very
hoppy
beer
with
a
hint
of
flowers
and
citrus
i
was
listening
to
some
pink
floyd
and
drinking
this
and
ive
got
to
say
this
is
a
very
good
red
ale
not
quite
as
good
as
a
lagunitas
imperial
red
ale
but
still
very
good
go
buy
you
a
4
pack
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
hoppy
beers
rockmotley
pours
dark
amber
with
medium
beige
head
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malt
and
citrusy
hops
taste
is
resinous
hops
upfront
that
fade
into
some
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
aftertaste
is
lingering
bitter
citrus
hops
palate
is
medium
and
somewhat
sticky
overall
nice
balance
with
some
sweet
maltiness
playing
well
with
the
big
hop
punch
awesome
good
balance
overall
a
nice
red
ale
with
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
upfront
there
isnt
as
much
malt
as
i
would
of
expected
but
it
is
still
well
balanced
this
beer
just
downright
looks
perfect
a
beautiful
color
with
crystal
clarity
i
really
need
to
do
a
sidebyside
with
founders
red
rye
since
this
is
pretty
close
for
a
red
ipa
wifes
review
looks
like
tea
doesnt
smell
like
tea
pretty
good
quite
the
hop
bomb
and
kick
to
the
palate

another
excellent
beer

o
i
dont
mean
to
call
a
brewery
out
for
this
but
it
seems
like
they
took
west
coast
ipaphenomenal
beer
btw
and
added
some
specialty
malts
with
the
same
hop
bill
either
way
its
really
good
if
you
like
your
american
ambers
on
the
hoppy
side
overall
a
very
complex
yet
balanced
ipa
i
want
to
drink
it
again
o
a
nice
ale
combining
a
red
with
an
ipa
and
using
amarillo
warrior
and
nugget
hops
possibly
more
attractive
to
fans
of
redamber
ales
than
to
fans
of
pale
ales
overall
one
of
the
more
complex
amber
ales
ive
had
recently
definitely
recommend
this
one
for
a
warm
summer
night
very
flavorful
red
with
more
bitterness
than
i
like
but
good
bones
o
a
nice
balanced
beer
would
deftly
buy
again
it
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malty
flavor
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
very
well
balanced
between
sweeter
notes
of
malt
and
bitter
notes
of
hops
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
up
there
with
lagunatis
mondo
which
is
probably
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
of
beer
due
to
the
more
prominent
hop
presence
o
i
love
amarillo
hop
flavor
this
is
a
great
intro
beer
into
the
flavor
without
being
overly
hoppy
and
in
your
face
amarillo
hop
head
red
pours
a
diarrhea
brown
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
tan
head
there
is
a
strong
earthy
aroma
with
some
hop
notes
the
taste
has
a
stronger
malt
flavor
with
some
notes
of
hops
very
earthy
notes
full
flavors
good
body
overall
its
a
good
red
ale
but
its
strongly
hoppy
and
strongly
malty
not
sure
what
was
going
on
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
nice
example
of
a
hoppy
red
ale
and
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
qualitys
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
the
hop
profile
was
nice
and
the
malt
base
was
identifiable
as
a
red
ale
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
a
little
refreshing
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
of
these
especially
when
the
weather
gets
a
little
warmer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
i
thought
they
were
both
pretty
good
and
they
were
what
i
expect
from
a
good
hoppy
red
ale
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
is
the
bitterness
level
its
a
little
low
for
the
style
and
i
think
the
malt
base
can
support
a
little
more
bitterness
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
red
ale
but
im
not
sure
i
would
buy
a
whole
six
pack
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
solid
hoppy
red
ale
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
solid
all
the
way
around
but
i
still
think
a
little
more
bitterness
might
take
this
beer
to
the
next
level
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
green
flash
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
very
solid
hoppy
red
ale
keep
up
the
good
work
its
intensity
maltiness
and
hop
character
would
hold
up
well
with
spicy
fried
food
cajun
buffalo
wings
etc
or
devils
on
horseback
mmmm
must
try
from
great
brewer
very
good
american
red
ale
malty
yeasty
and
hoppy
ale
bold
and
bitter
also
on
its
relative
price
though
o
wellbalanced
brew
i
dont
drink
too
many
red
ipas
but
found
this
really
enjoyable
would
definitely
have
again
o
if
you
read
review
youll
know
i
fell
in
love
with
hop
head
red
its
just
an
amazing
ale
that
may
well
be
my
all
time
favorite
all
around
everyday
brew
im
just
stunned
at
how
green
flash
nailed
this
almost
like
it
was
brewed
specifically
for
me
sure
most
people
rate
it
very
high
but
its
not
considered
a
real
gem
but
thats
good
for
me
considering
i
can
find
it
any
time
i
want
which
will
be
often
i
promise
you
that
green
flash
hop
head
red
my
favorite
brew
o
solid
red
ipa
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
lets
start
by
saying
i
love
green
flash
this
brew
blends
two
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
red
and
ipa
it
pours
a
cloudy
red
amber
hue
with
an
off
white
head
that
gives
way
to
a
gentle
white
film
and
slight
lacing
the
nose
is
fresh
and
hoppy
with
citrus
and
grassy
notes
abounding
there
is
also
a
substantial
malt
background
that
reminds
one
that
this
is
a
red
ale
it
sips
smooth
and
light
light
with
a
very
pleasant
bitter
coating
to
the
palate
the
flavors
are
refreshing
and
easy
on
the
palate
definite
citrus
hops
notes
and
a
refreshing
finish
that
reminds
me
of
faygo
red
pop
this
is
a
delicious
hybrid
from
one
of
americas
best
brewers
cant
wait
to
enjoy
another
on
a
hot
summers
day
ooverall
ive
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
its
a
hybrid
of
a
malty
amber
ale
and
ipa
great
combo
overall
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
there
is
nothing
here
that
is
abrasive
it
is
smooth
and
balanced
and
is
likely
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
versions
of
this
class
that
has
ever
graced
me
palate
all
too
often
things
are
overdone
but
this
one
seems
just
right
i
will
be
visiting
upon
this
again
with
haste
distinctive
taste
familiar
to
other
green
flash
beers
a
litte
more
accessible
that
the
ipa
slightly
less
burnt
toast
taste
more
malt
well
balanced
and
still
substantial
not
too
thin
or
bland
looks
and
smells
great
taste
is
dintinct
but
not
quite
my
favorite
personally
a
very
good
beer
medium
amber
pour
with
a
ruby
hue
served
on
draft
and
arrived
with
a
small
head
and
almost
no
lacing
nice
nose
of
pine
hops
tending
towards
spruce
almost
medium
bodied
with
normal
carbonation
nice
almost
slick
mouthfeel
a
nice
spruce
flavor
over
a
slight
sweetness
is
found
in
this
well
crafted
and
balanced
ale
this
one
is
hop
flavor
rather
than
bitterness
focused
crisp
finish
of
spruce
and
sweetness
a
slight
bitterness
lingers
quite
nice
o
solid
red
ipa
really
happy
with
the
beers
green
flash
is
distributing
to
mo
the
taste
has
a
full
malt
flavor
to
the
point
that
it
almost
makes
me
think
of
a
weaker
barleywine
or
scotch
ale
there
is
most
definitely
a
kick
of
bitterness
after
all
the
malts
explode
in
my
mouth
i
have
heard
plenty
of
raves
about
this
brewer
so
i
am
hoping
this
was
not
a
batch
of
bad
beer
but
beer
that
went
bad
in
transit
i
will
give
it
a
second
chance
when
i
have
the
opportunity
o
a
great
red
ipa
alcohol
is
apparent
though
it
still
drinks
very
easily
thanks
to
the
hefty
but
smooth
malt
body
well
worth
a
try
the
beer
has
a
ruby
red
color
that
is
clear
and
filtered
the
head
is
slightly
tannish
and
creamy
that
dissipates
slowly
after
a
while
the
beer
has
a
floral
smell
as
well
as
a
bit
of
pine
resin
the
hop
smells
are
balanced
out
by
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
but
still
has
an
overall
hoppy
smell
the
beer
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
but
is
less
hop
forward
the
sweet
malt
taste
is
stronger
than
the
smell
and
has
a
hint
of
breaded
malt
the
beer
also
has
a
strong
bitter
hop
taste
with
hints
of
pine
resin
the
pine
lingers
in
the
mouth
afterwards
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
a
smooth
feel
even
though
it
is
a
little
thick
overall
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
in
the
future

as
new
favorite
overall
a
very
solid
red
ale
good
mix
of
juicy
and
spicy
hops
with
a
solid
backing
of
caramel
malt
o
a
flavorful
brew
with
spice
contending
with
hop
bitterness
for
attention
70
ibus
in
evidence
final
thoughts
green
flash
has
only
recently
begun
distributing
to
mn
so
ive
been
trying
to
try
anything
i
can
find
from
them
while
i
was
impressed
with
their
other
ipa
offerings
i
find
myself
a
bit
disappointed
with
their
red
ipa
effort
the
flavor
just
seemed
to
be
missing
that
sort
of
spark
that
makes
me
want
to
take
another
sip
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
im
always
willing
to
give
a
beer
another
try
if
its
from
a
brewery
that
has
earned
my
respect
like
green
flash
has
done
where
the
hell
is
the
freshness
date
pours
to
a
thick
rocky
beige
head
that
lasts
as
a
half
inch
topping
and
leaves
ample
lacing
color
is
a
nice
reddish
amber
aroma
is
mostly
straight
up
amarillo
hop
pellets
and
not
much
else
quite
nice
but
no
malt
flavor
is
hoppy
citrusy
and
has
a
roasty
malty
backbone
finishes
bitter
and
floral
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slick
overall
a
good
quaff
for
those
who
like
both
malt
and
hops
i
may
have
liked
this
beer
more
before
they
jacked
up
the
hop
levels
just
a
west
coast
ipa
that
appears
to
be
in
red
ale
form
sort
of
like
the
label
claims
overpriced
and
no
bottle
dates
so
i
will
not
buy
it
again
o
had
this
beer
many
times
but
first
time
review
this
beer
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
red
ipa
very
delicious
well
balanced
have
yet
to
be
let
down
by
green
flash
over
all
this
was
a
good
beer
not
my
style
loved
their
west
coast
ipa
12oz
bottle
like
the
shape
of
the
bottle
from
lifesource

darker

some

tsste
is
really

toffee

come
through
strong
low
bitter
ending
hops
go
on
for
a
while
in
this
low
profile
nice
thick
and
interesting
mouth
feel
very
nice
beer
that
i
had
passed
by
many
times
once
you
open
the
hop
head
red
you
are
instantly
hit
with
a
citrusy
hoppy
aroma
it
poured
a
dark
reddish
ambercopper
with
a
huge
head
with
a
taste
that
was
heavier
on
the
malts
with
a
full
toffee
flavor
the
hops
were
not
as
intense
as
i
would
have
expected
from
the
aroma
but
the
bitterness
is
still
present
the
malts
definitely
assert
themselves
and
keep
the
hops
at
bay
overall
the
hop
head
red
was
a
tasty
brew
o
a
refreshing
beer
for
any
time
88
o
my
leastfavorite
offering
from
green
flash
brewery
so
far
although
the
appearance
was
excellent
the
rest
of
the
package
was
lacking
although
i
had
several
gripes
with
the
beer
the
lack
of
balance
was
the
biggest
gripe
it
was
certainly
drinkable
but
not
worth
spending
money
on
apparently
even
good
breweries
can
make
mediocre
beers
first
let
me
say
my
smell
sucks
and
only
works
on
potent
or
pungent
aromas
this
one
must
have
been
mild
it
poured
nice
with
a
thin
layer
of
chestnut
coloured
foam
that
taste
was
not
bitter
and
no
strong
flavor
one
way
or
another
but
went
down
smoothly
overall
very
drinkable
and
provides
a
pleasant
buzz
taste
is
bright
and
packed
with
rich
full
citric
hops
goodness
finishes
more
piney
and
bitter
quite
a
delicious
and
worthy
ale
as
close
to
an
red
ipa
as
ive
had
hah
overall
nice
take
on
a
hoppy
red
that
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
lagunitas
strong
ale
any
of
them
really
and
deschutes
jubelale
and
that
is
aokay
with
me
pours
a
dark
copper
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
the
head
retained
for
some
time
and
left
nice
layers
of
lacing
in
its
wake
the
nose
is
pungently
hoppy
the
upfront
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
however
the
malt
flavor
is
rather
weak
but
the
hop
profile
roars
back
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
unique
red
with
some
unique
floralberrylike
components
overall
very
disappointed
would
like
to
try
this
beer
within
a
month
or
so
of
bottling
but
thats
the
only
way
i
would
give
it
another
chance
i
have
had
many
ipas
yes
i
know
this
is
an
amber
up
to
6
months
from
bottling
date
that
while
perhaps
not
as
hop
potent
still
tasted
very
good
hoping
the
rayon
vert
west
coast
ipa
and
palate
wrecker
in
the
fridge
will
be
better
than
this
watch
this
space
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
love
the
hoppy
bitter
flavors
on
the
palate
to
be
specific
the
flavor
is
wintergreen
it
displayed
a
clean
fresh
finish
which
is
very
much
to
my
taste
i
had
it
with
chinese
food
and
it
paired
well
i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
o
a
fine
hoppy
ale
even
if
it
does
suffer
from
too
much
of
a
good
thing
hop
overload
aka
a
dose
of
astringency
the
big
sweetness
isnt
my
thing
making
it
good
but
not
great
in
my
mind
but
it
pays
off
in
this
beer
for
balances
sake
finding
a
fresher
bottle
might
be
nice
but
it
wont
be
a
priority
any
time
soon
o
i
really
like
this
beer
very
similar
to
lagunitas
mondo
red
ale
being
that
its
a
hop
forward
red
i
think
i
actually
prefer
this
more
and
with
less
alcohol
you
can
crack
another
starts
out
tasting
like
a
classic
ipa
brings
on
tincture
of
vanilla
in
the
midtaste
morphing
to
smokiness
at
the
finish
long
lingering
distinctive
aftertaste
yields
a
sensation
similar
to
eating
blackened
bbq
robust
mouthfeel
congrats
to
the
brewer
for
creating
a
unique
tasting
and
thirst
quenching
brew
the
verdict
delicious
a
hop
monster
at
70
ibu
but
well
balanced
with
a
nice
malt
character
combinations
dont
often
work
well
but
this
hybrid
of
red
ale
and
dipa
treads
that
fine
line
perfectly
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
favorite
o
a
solid
hoppy
red
amber
ale
when
fresh
8
weeks
or
less
after
bottling
its
good
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
like
this
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
would
most
definitely
drink
this
again
easily
my
favorite
effort
from
green
flash
of
the
ones
i
have
tried
so
far
and
well
worth
trying
for
those
seeking
hop
forward
selections
for
me
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
sweetness
and
malt
a
very
well
balanced
and
refined
brew
basically
an
amber
ipa
mouthfeel
overall
mediumbodied
very
attenuated
on
the
carbonation
yet
not
overly
flat
this
red
india
pale
ale
tastes
like
a
numbeddown
version
of
a
barleywine
using
predominant
american
piney
hops
and
of
course
dryhopped
to
add
more
depth
of
bitterness
and
resins
to
the
overall
flavour
profile
overall
it
is
far
more
estery
than
bd
and
the
palate
hints
at
a
possible
closetoexpirydate
freshness
for
this
bottle
but
still
i
find
it
an
extremely
enjoyable
experience
with
this
beer
style
with
an
ironic
name
red
india
pale
ale
o
great
brew
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
caramel
twist
hop
head
red
has
a
spicy
aroma
characteristic
of
the
amarillo
hops
used
currently
for
dry
hopping
prior
to
bottling
plenty
of
malt
flavors
to
balance
the
hops
and
certainly
bitter
on
the
finish
which
sugests
a
lot
of
hops
throughout
the
boil
as
well
overall
a
versatile
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
with
or
without
food
summer
or
winter
o
i
really
enjoy
red
ales
that
are
hopped
to
the
max
they
are
almost
like
iipas
because
there
is
always
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
compliment
the
big
punch
of
hops
ive
not
had
many
red
ipas
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
awesome
i
got
this
stuff
about
4
weeks
old
i
had
passed
on
it
a
few
times
because
it
was
seriously
dated
pours
a
deep
amber
aroma
is
citrusy
with
pine
also
and
sweet
malts
this
beer
is
far
above
average
and
is
solidifying
red
ipas
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
taste
is
awesome
bitter
grapefruity
up
front
balanced
by
sweet
bready
malts
pine
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
overall
pretty
awesome
beer
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
wish
it
came
in
6packs
best
thing
ive
had
from
green
flash
so
far
o
this
red
ipa
had
less
hops
in
the
aroma
yet
was
more
bitter
and
earthy
disappointing
and
clearly
less
appealing
than
the
westbrook
ipa
too
bad
there
are
only
3
left
in
fridge
lol
a
mediumbodied
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
wellbalanced
both
crisp
and
smooth
o
this
one
is
surely
awesome
much
better
than
most
ive
tried
of
this
style
balance
through
and
through
very
smooth
not
much
harshness
to
speak
of
here
the
complexity
is
great
hop
heads
might
complain
that
there
isnt
enough
hoppiness
what
it
lacks
in
that
department
it
makes
up
for
in
the
synergy
of
the
astm
categories
hop
head
red
is
a
classic
maybe
its
the
addition
of
its
parts
that
doesnt
do
well
enough
to
represent
the
whole
mighty
tasty
respectfully
so
o
would
love
to
get
this
a
little
bit
closer
to
the
bottling
date
but
the
aroma
still
popped
appearance
follows
the
name
appropriately
taste
was
wonderfully
complex
and
had
great
balance
perfect
feel
i
judged
this
beer
based
on
what
i
thought
the
brewer
was
trying
to
produce
versus
the
american
ipa
style
guidelines
taste
follows
the
nose
piney
hops
floral
hops
sweet
and
slightly
roastynutty
malt
ending
with
lemon
and
orange
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
heavy
with
low
carbonation
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
some
astringency
coming
from
bitterness
no
alcohol
deep
crimson
light
khaki
head
of
creamy
foam
not
quite
the
blast
of
hops
i
was
expecting
from
green
flash
but
the
sturdy
malt
backbone
is
probably
partly
to
blame
bready
with
a
healthy
dose
of
toffee
and
just
a
faint
roastiness
hops
lend
a
big
spiciness
and
floral
note
backed
by
orange
flesh
bitterness
is
balanced
pretty
evenly
clean
west
coast
style
all
the
way
a
big
red
ale
loaded
with
character
another
properly
brewed
american
craft
ale
from
green
flash
httpbeardedbrewreview

o
ok
this
beer
isnt
what
i
remember
although
i
think
every
time
ive
had
this
in
the
past
it
has
been
on
tap
im
assuming
this
one
has
too
much
age
on
it
its
actually
not
bad
if
it
were
just
a
big
red
ale
or
even
an
old
ale
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
more
bitter
version
of
gd
hibernation
as
a
red

with

made
some
slight
recipe
changes
to
this
beer
in
redefining
it
as
a
red

but
its
still
delicious
o
more

amberforward
on
the
taste
a
great
drinker
and
im
not
sure
this
bottle
was
the
freshest
good
stuff
o
this
is
an
excellent
american
red
alered
ipa
and
unlike
many
beers
of
this
type
has
quite
a
bit
of
personality
i
could
see
this
becoming
a
staple
in
my
refrigerator
for
one
i
appreciate
a
well
balanced
amber
ale
but
these
more
hoppy
versions
appeal
much
better
to
me
as
the
hopforward
nature
of
the
beers
give
more
intrigue
and
better
offset
the
caramel
sweetness
and
weight
of
most
beers
of
the
style
o
nice
hoppy
red
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
one
good
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
full
and
creamy
mouth
feel
overall
its
an
odd
one
genial
but
without
a
whole
lot
of
substance
and
some
weird
ideas
about
what
the
styles
supposed
to
be
it
looks
like
an
ipa

comes
off

saccharine

o
i
dont
remember
much
when
i
had
this
fresh
but
aged
it
tastes
just
fine
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
keep
coming
back
to
its
just
an
easy
to
drink
great
tasting
red
pours
a
nice
copper
smells
fantastic
and
has
an
amazing
taste
not
to
much
wrong
with
this
one
if
youre
not
into
red
beers
id
suggest
trying
to
get
back
into
them
with
this
one
a
goto
4pack
i
pick
up
on
a
regular
basis
overall
i
think
it
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
a
little
sweeter
than
i
typically
would
want
in
an
ipa
but
i
like
it
its
hard
to
find
a
thing
wrong
with
this
beer
beautiful
pour
tons
of

be
cleaned
the
glass
does
after
each
pour
craggy
tan
head
with
outstanding
retention
scents
of
pine
oils
and
cherry
juices
a
very
dark
beer
for
a
red
ale
medium
bodied
with
a
remarkable
balance
between
the
rich
maltiness
and
the
hoppy
bitterness
the
malty
backbone
hits
the
palate
as
do
the
hops
followed
by
a
semisweet
finish
that
is
not
cloying
an
absolute
masterpiece
of
a
brew
that
can
be
drank
anytime
of
the
year
and
multiple
brews
in
a
session
o
good
but
not
great
very
drinkable
appearance
is
very
deep
crimson
color
with
a
fluffy
two
inch
head
you
dont
have
to
stick
your
nose
into
this
one
to
get
a
whiff
of
the
potent
hops
and
grassy
notes
in
this
beer
great
smell
and
my
first
taste
didnt
disappoint
either
as
a
professed
hophead
i
was
pretty
satisfied
with
this
beer
the
hops
are
the
main
attraction
and
the
beer
finishes
very
nicely
to
make
it
very
drinkable
lingering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
medium
mouthfeel
lightly
and
drinkably
make
this
one
that
you
can
have
multiple
of
in
a
night
i
imagine
this
is
even
better
when
enjoyed
straight
from
a
fresh
tap
awesome
beer
though
i
dont
quite
put
it
up
there
with
nugget
nectar
this
is
damn
close
taste
is
strongly
caramely
slightly
sour
and
hoppy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
crisp
green
finish
with
no
residual
off
flavors
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
very
little
head
but
lace
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
its
flavor
has
notes
of
grapefruit
caramel
toffee
and
a
strong
hop
bitterness
and
mild
malt
sweetness
the
bitterness
while
leaving
an
aftertaste
in
the
finish
mellows
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
green
flash
hop
head
red
ale
is
a
decent
beer
smooth
and
dry
recommended
overall
pretty
nice
and
big
ipa
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
a
bright
red
amber
ipa
with
a
2
inch
white
head
smells
like
a
west
coast
ipa
extremely
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
the
nose
with
a
rather
heavy
feeling
sucrose
element
very
little
bitterness
for
such
a
hoppy
beer
more
resin
like
and
sticky
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
plenty
bubbly
and
medium
bodied
overall
a
good
ipa
but
because
of
the
sweetness
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
them
all
night
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
beautiful
bright
red
with
3
inch
tanish
red
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
smell
pineapple
tangerine
carmel
and
pine
taste
is
all
of
that
perfectly
balanced
with
a
little
grapefruit
in
the
finish
body
is
wonderful
pretty
chewy
for
7
easy
drinking
and
plenty
of
life
i
really
like
how
the
kicked
this
up
a
notch
and
made
the
price
feel
better
do
to
the
abv
being
higher
and
the
taste
being
even
better
appearance
is
ruby
with
a
two
finger
head
its
nose
has
caramel
grapefruit
and
pin
taking
a
sip
of
this
bright
colored
red
ale
i
taste
a
sweet
aspect
right
away
not
sweet
like
some
stouts
or
other
beers
but
a
really
nice
hoppy
amber
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
moderate
carbonation
to
it
it
drinks
easily
and
is
a
tasty
beer
this
beer
is
a
bit
stale
and
the
hops
are
subdued
aside
from
the
bitterness
nice
try
at
a
red
ipa
not
something
id
drink
again
though
o
as
the
title
suggests
hop
heads
may
enjoy
this
beer
as
that
is
all
there
is
only
the
bitter
hop
taste
with
nothing
other
than
its
looks
to
be
its
saving
grace
kinda
like
katy
perry
a
good
beer
is
a
balanced
beer
this
one
is
just
a
bit
top
heavy
this
is
an
excellent
beer
one
damn
solid
red
that
avoids
the
dreaded
malt
coma
this
uses
the
malt
the
hops
to
weaves
a
lovely
dance
sans
pole
that
i
could
watch
for
hours
brewers
dream
of
creating
a
onecelled
organism
that
tastes
this
good
only
my
third
green
flash
beer
theyre
3
for
3
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
suffers
from
a
bit
of
excess
booziness
fails
to
live
up
to
its
name
and
is
overpriced
drink
this
overall
surprised
to
see
the
lower
scores
on
this
beer
though
this
is
a
very
fresh
bottle
i
imagine
that
this
beer
suffers
dramatically
from
age
theres
some
really
great
subtle
interplay
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
the
amarillo
dryhopping
certainly
adds
some
great
citrus
qualities
to
an
already
great
beer
ill
definitely
seek
this
out
in
the
future
o
a
powerful
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
flavors
to
sift
through
and
digest
but
still
doesnt
feel
heavy
or
as
alcoholic
as
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
o
i
am
a
fan
of
red
ales
with
a
hoppy
finish
green
flash
make
a
valiant
attempt
to
take
a
step
further
with
mixed
results
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
since
hops
that
have
been
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
can
become
harsh
and
lose
their
balance
right
now
i
find
the
green
flash
hop
head
red
ale
a
much
better
beer
than
the
ipa
version
overall
a
solid
beer
o
this
is
probably
the
best
red
ale
ive
ever
had
spot
on
worth
picking
up
o
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
particularly
noteworthy
and
the
taste
was
not
far
behind
the
flavor
was
a
well
blended
and
not
overly
sweet
coming
through
with
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
and
biscuits
solid
beer
all
around
and
definitely
worth
a
try
i
could
smell
it
all
day
the
body
was
medium
to
full
bodied
adequate
carbonation
make
i
think
that
a
little
bit
more
malt
complexity
would
go
a
long
way
i
admit
that
im
a
sucker
for
a
hoppy
red
ale
but
there
are
a
few
others
out
there
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
cheers
solid
red
ale
a
plethora
of
hop
flavors
similar
to
their
ipa
nice
malt
presence
too
without
being
overpowering
o
hop
head
red
delivers
on
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
high
hoppy
bitterness
balanced
out
by
smooth
candy
caramel
malts
appearance
nose
and
mouthfeel
are
exceptional
pine
citrus
florals
and
grassy
hops
are
very
well
balanced
green
flashs
west
coast
ipa
is
a
personal
favorite
hop
head
red
follows
that
beers
lead
nicely
this
was
a
very
strong
pickup
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
while
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
amarillo
hops
this
is
one
of
the
better
red
ipas
i
have
encountered
as
the
balance
is
excellent
green
flash
is
one
of
the
kings
of
the
west
coast
style
and
this
beer
is
no
different
overall
being
a
red
ale
it
only
seems
easy
to
borrow
some
references
in
describing
this
beer
sure
as
a
redhead
is
to
captivate
you
with
her
looks
and
ultimately
steal
your
heart
this
beer
does
it
shes
got
red
hair
and
curves
watch
out
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
love
the
hop
kick
at
the
finish
the
carbonation
really
helps
to
carry
this
beer
through
overall
a
good
red
ale
that
is
a
nice
session
beer
and
very
drinkable
o
well
its
much
better
than
killians
which
according
to
untappd
is
what
this
beer
is
comparable
to
realistically
speaking
though
this
beer
was
too
old
the
hops
are
just
gone
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
years
ago
when
it
was
fresh
and
i
was
blown
away
by
how
intense
and
bitter
it
was
unfortunately
i
didnt
write
reviews
back
then
so
looking
forward
to
a
fresh
batch
and
a
new
review
o
a
really
nice
complex
red
ale
that
lets
the
hops
shine
through
without
skimping
on
a
nice
bready
and
sweet
malt
backbone
a
little
offkilter
and
boozy
at
nearly
6
5
abv
but
its
easily
replaced
cascazilla
as
one
of
my
favorite
hopped
out
reds
an
accessible
delicious
super
hoppy
red
ale
this
is
a
solid
beer
im
fast
becoming
a
big
imperial
redred
ipa
fan
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
more
of
an
ipa
with
amber
characteristics
its
very
hoppy
and
the
hop
flavors
and
aromas
are
balanced
well
with
the
malt
nothing
too
complex
but
definitely
a
good
beer
to
reach
for
now
and
again
pours
a
clear
red
with
a
big
airy
tan
head
smells
of
earthy
dank
hops
taste
is
a
biscuity
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
sweet
toffee
middle
and
a
big
citrus
earthy
finish
big
hop
flavor
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
though
mouthfeel
is
average
slightly
low
carbonation
overall
a
quite
good
red
ale
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
o
i
really
like
this
offering
from
green
flash
the
new
packaging
bills
it
as
a
red
ipa
and
it
lives
up
to
that
classification
a
great
hop
profile
balanced
with
a
nice
malt
bill
make
this
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
ale
all
star
worthy
dr
very
drinkable
above
average
abv
and
fairly
priced
id
certainly
have
it
again
if
it
were
on
draught
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
like
that
its
got
ipa
levels
of
hops
but
in
a
slightly
different
framework
a
good
hop
fix
with
something
more
than
just
hops
the
green
flash
hop
head
red
is
a
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
smackerle
the
appearance
is
dark
ruby
read
with
white
frothy
foam
which
laced
beautifully
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
subtle
and
not
overpowering
with
any
one
theme
certainly
malt
and
hop
were
present
the
taste
was
a
very
nice
full
bodied
red
ale
that
had
good
malt
character
with
hints
of
hop
that
balanced
the
beer
very
well
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
certainly
will
try
this
again
if
i
can
find
it
in
my
local
beer
store
o
very
solid
beer
that
is
on
the
verge
of
great
a
bit
more
aroma
and
carbonation
probably
not
green
flashes
fault
and
this
would
be
exceptional
still
very
very
good
overall
i
consider
this
to
be
an
amberipa
hybrid
that
to
me
at
least
is
closer
to
the
ipa
side
of
things
it
has
the
malts
and
color
of
an
amber
but
the
hops
profile
of
an
ipa
which
definitely
stands
out
more
it
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
a
nice
hybrid
but
there
are
definitely
individual
ambers
and
ipas
i
would
prefer
to
the
hop
head
red
that
being
said
i
would
have
it
again
and
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
heaps
of
clingy
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is

touch

finished
with

overall
it

and
tastes
good
and
with
a
few
tweaks
could
could
be
right
up
there
would
buy
again
though
cheers
o
pretty
good
amber
ale
a
little
too
hopforward
for
my
taste
as
far
as
ambers
go
very
smooth
though
and
it
looks
fantastic
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
some
time
ago
i
think
it
might
have
been
seen
as
a
very
good
beer
for
me
i
think
my
palate
has
gone
more
places
but
i
respect
the
fact
that
this
is
one
of
those
southern
california
session
beers
that
craft
and
bmc
people
alike
could
appreciate
for
what
it
is
its
hard
not
to
appreciate
it
that
said
it
comes
off
a
bit
too
tame
to
me
now
still
a
good
combination
of
resiny
pine
and
light
candy
sweetness
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
o
this
is
an
outstanding
red
ale
i
really
was
impressed
with
this
one
although
it
really
could
just
be
called
an
ipa
od
a
great
beer
very
hoppy
but
not
out
of
balance
pretty
drinkable
too
quite
a
bit
of
taste
packed
into
this
6
4
beauty
pours
a
deep
copperish
red
color
with
nice
head
smells
like
fresh
hops
piney
citrusgreen
apple
this
beer
starts
out
with
a
faint
sweetness
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
good
carbonation
then
come
the
hops
and
finishes
very
bitter
i
really
like
this
beer
at
first
i
was
kind
of
skeptical
because
i
do
not
like
their
west
coast
ipa
so
id
say
go
out
and
try
it
its
really
good
overall
this
is
an
above
average
brew
and
worthy
of
a
go
the
sediment
doesnt
bother
me
but
may
be
a
turn
off
for
others
overall
i
expected
more
from
this
that
doesnt
mean
i
didnt
enjoy
it
i
wanted
more
west
coast
ipa
but
got
more
red
my
bad
this
brewery
doesnt
have
misleading
labels
their
west
coast
ipa
is
named
west
coast
ipa
a
must
try
if
you
can
pours
a
translucent
redcopperbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
toasted
and
caramel
malts
with
a
backbone
of
hops
the
flavor
is
layers
of
strong
hoppiness
and
toasted
malts
with
the
hoppiness
being
more
dominant
in
the
front
and
the
malts
in
the
finish
there
is
just
a
touch
metallic
flavor
in
the
hops
but
it
is
super
minor
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
good
body
and
a
nice
medium
carbonation
sits
a
touch
sweet
on
the
tongue
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
substantial
hoppiness
for
an
amber
i
am
enjoying
it
probably
more
than
i
will
rate
it
but
it
is
nice
on
a
hot
day
high
overall
as
it
was
a
great
beer
to
grab
a
4
pack
of
and
drink
it
all
overall
this
is
a
strong
and
complex
beer
that
keeps
things
interesting
each
sip
allows
the
drinker
to
learn
something
more

say
thank
you
amarillo
great
beer
although
a
bit
pricey
if
it
were
a
bit
more
reasonably
priced
id
probably
buy
it
on
the
regular
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
it
is
one
and
done
for
me
a
very
nice
red
with
ample
hops
to
drown
out
the
typical
toomalty
red
style
worthy
of
multiple
pints
and
should
please
most
hop
heads
as
the
name
indicates
nice
compromise
of
the
two
styles
hop
head
red
is
a
bit
too
pricey
to
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
which
is
a
shame
as
its
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
o
this
beer
is
as
advertised
hop
head
red
has
more
of
a
bitter
edge
than
many
of
the
beers
that
boast
these
bloated
high
ibu
levels
i
am
shocked
to
discover
that
this
beer
has
a
meager
45
ibus
making
this
beer
a
real
curiosity
pretty
unique
here
and
it
does
what
it
says
on
the
label
like
it
but
the
straddling
of
styles
gives
me
the
impression
of
being
sort
of
four
square
despite
the
minor
whinge
this
is
still
prettty
fannytastic
m
medium
to
strong
body
lighty
carbonated
and
rich
o
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
find
to
be
in
love
with
hops
and
hoppy
beers
i
too
love
hops
and
overthetop
ipas
but
i
really
appreciate
when
a
brewer
can
put
together
a
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
ipa
this
is
one
of
those
ipas
one
of
my
favs
for
the
style
super
hoppy
with
that
stylistic
caramelly
nuttiness
and
very
quaffable
excited
for
green
flashs
expansion
and
more
to
come
overall
very
nicely
hopped
red
ale
good
alternative
to
an
ipa
if
you
dont
quite
as
much
hops
being
a
hophead
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
recommend
it
overall
a
nice
hoppy
american
red
recommended
overall
this
is
a
good
hoppy
beer
though
i
do
find
that
several
quick
mouthfuls
in
a
row
produces
a
pine
tar
sensation
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
can
be
distracting
sip
slowly
then
and
enjoy
o
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
two
max
but
the
beer
is
obviously
well
crafted
nice
alternative
to
an
ipa
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
it
should
tempt
me
to
get
down
to
their
new
brewerytasting
room
to
try
a
few
of
their
others
out
o
this
was
the
first
offering
that
ive
tried
from
green
flash
i
enjoyed
it
enough
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
other
styles
from
this
brewery
next
to
only
nn
in
my
book
of
hoppy
reds
ive
finally
found
a
green
flash
beer
im
eager
to
drink
again
got
a
few
bottles
of
it
for
the
trip
home
i
like
hoppy
ambers
much
more
than
more
traditional
ambers
this
one
is
pretty
good
but
a
notch
below
the
best
notes
this
beer
is
a
fullflavored
full
bodied
red
complex
flavors
yet
very
wellbalanced
at
the
same
time
incredibly
drinkable
yet
it
does
show
a
bit
of
heat
on
the
tail
end
nonetheless
its
a
tasty
brew
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
red
definitely
better
flavor
balance
and
depth
than
the
alpine
red
i
had
the
other
day
its
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
although
its
not
my
favorite
i
do
recommend
a
try
though
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
a
hop
forward
version
of
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
big
hoppiness
to
it
very
solid
beer
all
around
o
if
im
feeling
ambers
for
the
night
definitely
a
beer
i
will
gravitate
towards
in
the
store
green
flash
cant
be
wrong
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
lots
of
yeast
dregs
float
around
with
an
off
color
white
light
tan
head
it
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
pine
hops
and
caramel
malts
the
feel
is
medium
light
the
initial
taste
is
of
hops
you
get
some
of
the
caramel
malts
on
the
way
down
and
then
it
leaves
you
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
prefer
the
flavor
and
higher
hops
of
their
regular
ipa
the
true
hop
head
ive
been
pretty
impressed
with
the
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
i
hope
to
be
able
to
find
more
since
it
is
more
prevalent
here
and
i
am
more
familiar
with
lagunitas
this
beer
has
lagunitas
similarities
like
brown
shugga
without
the
brown
sugar
or
all
the
booze
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
deep
haze
actually
similar
in
color
to
a
dopplebock
poured
with
a
frosty
offwhite
head
that
slowly
reduces
to
a
wispy
cap
and
a
few
sticky
lacings
very
fresh
hop
aroma
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
bag
of
hop
pellets
floral
and
pine
hop
aromas
along
with
caramelized
malt
medium
bodied
with
a
lighly
resinous
feel
fresh
floral
hop
flavor
up
front
with
a
hint
of
citrus
floral
hop
continues
through
the
middle
with
the
citrus
flavors
transitioning
to
pine
and
sweet
carmelized
malt
coming
thru
pine
hop
and
sweet
malt
flavors
carry
through
to
the
end
with
a
lingering
pine
hop
bitterness
complex
aroma
and
flavor
profile
this
was
awesome
this
is
an
amber
for
ipa
drinkers
and
thats
why
i
like
it
reminecient
of
a
nugget
nectar
but
not
quite
as
awesome
not
for
the
normal
amber
beer
lovers
but
a
great
brew
nonetheless
really
happy
to
be
able
to
get
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
some
time
solid
brew
find
it
and
buy
it
o
ive
heard
people
say
this
is
a
decent
comparison
to
nugget
nectar
i
hope
thats
not
too
true
as
i
really
want
to
try
that
one
and
this
beer
is
good
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
i
expected
more
of
hop
presence
and
even
more
malt
i
guess
a
much
bigger
beer
although
i
feel
my
expectations
were
too
high
and
that
may
have
hindered
my
experience
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
nonetheless
hv
o
awesome
hoppy
beer
i
drank
it
a
lot
but
i
find
fall
is
the
best
time
of
the
year
for
this
beer
a
good
mouthfeel
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
if
you
like
red
ales
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
maybe
my
thoughts
sound
harsh
its
well
crafted
but
simply
average
i
expected
more
from
green
flash
one
of
the
best
redamber
ales
around
highly
recommended
notes
maybe
not
the
most
impressive
i
have
had
from
them
but
in
its
sense
of
balance
it
sure
is
in
the
upper
bracket
maybe
it
is
a
touch
too
hoppy
for
not
hoppy
aficionados
but
it
could
be
a
nice
and
tasty
entry
point
thats
not
to
say
that
there
isnt
any
noticeable
alcohol
in
this
there
is
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
taste
it
took
a
while
to
get
this
beer
down
but
if
i
wanted
something
with
hops
after
dinner
this
would
fit
the
bill
nicely
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
but
its
well
worth
seeking
out
in
a
sea
of
hopbombs
and
powerful
brews
theres
no
doubt
that
this
can
appeal
to
quite
a
few
segments
of
craftbeer
enthusiasts
little
too
bitter
for
me
good
flavor
gets
a
little
buried
and
sidetracked
o
winner
for
me
great
stuff
from
gf
looked
and
smelled
nice
but
ultimately
a
disappointing
beer
from
green
flash
o
there
are
very
few
who
do
these
types
of
hop
bombs
quite
like
green
flash
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
brewer
did
a
very
good
job
in
making
it
oh
and
it
did
pair
very
well
with
the
food
a
red
ale
through
and
through
balance
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
a
sweet
malty
start
is
followed
by
a
hoppy
aftertaste
a
moderate
carbonation
level
makes
this
an
easy
sipper
not
my
favorite
red
but
something
i
would
drink
again
o
not
that
good
of
a
beer
the
flavor
lacks
depth
and
the
very
dry
body
is
a
bit
odd
for
the
style
very
smooth
and
balanced
nice
and
bitter
up
front
some
of
the
usual
grapefruit
and
citrus
nice
carbonation
tingling
on
my
tongue
wish
this
was
fresh
please
post
damb
dates
12oz
bottle
pours
hazy
amber
with
thick
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
and
light
carbonation
aroma
of
hard
candy
like
an
orange
tootsie
pop
florals
and
caramel
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
sharp
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
spicy
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
my
prefered
style
other
reviewers
have
noted
its
similarity
to
nugget
nectar
and
i
have
to
agree
but
was
left
feeling
like
this
had
a
slightly
harsher
hop
bite
to
it
still
a
great
pint
though
im
not
sure
id
be
willing
to
follow
one
with
another
o
a
solid
red
that
i
would
drink
again
not
better
than
west
coast
ipa
but
a
good
sub
for
nugget
nectar
in
san
diego
overall
impression
an
aptly
named
beer
bests
nugget
nectar
in
the
this
is
basically
a
red
ipa
category
their
west
coast
ipa
is
amazing
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
not
a
typical
american
amber
has
the
feel
of
a
much
bigger
beer
and
lives
up
to
its
name
the
cpj
the
liquid
was
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
caramel
grapefruit
sugar
and
a
hint
of
peach
the
taste
consists
of
pine
and
mango
with
bready
malt
and
a
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
very
smooth
and
it
has
a
dry
finish
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
the
sweet
malt
is
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
amarillo
hops
d
good
example
of
an
american
amber
but
not
my
favorite
frankly
i
was
a
little
turned
off
by
the
amount
of
hop
particulate
that
was
in
my
glass
and
i
wasnt
really
blown
away
by
any
one
aspect
of
the
beer
o
could
be
a
little
more
flavoursome
but
worth
a
shot
o
an
interesting
beer
not
one
that
i
would
session
with
but
certainly
tasty
and
was
enjoyable
with
cheese
and
cold
meats
overall
pretty
interesting
brew
a
little
complex
and
goodtasting
pours
a
deep
amber
burnt
orange
with
an
off
white
cream
tan
head
mellow
malt
aroma
smooth
malt
start
that
collides
with
a
hoppier
finish
theres
a
light
creamy
middle
that
eases
your
way
into
the
hop
finish
toasted
malt
provides
a
nice
bite
that
compliments
the
hops
cant
really
say
much
more
about
this
beer
its
pretty
good
one
at
a
time
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
one
after
another
probably
pretty
good
with
some
mild
spicy
food
food
pairing
filled
pasta
roasted
chicken
roasted
pork
munster
cheese
goat
cheese
sausage
this
beer
came
around
after
a
spell
in
the
glass
ultimately
though
this
was
a
yawn
fest
nothing
stood
out
on
it
incredibly
drab
and
boring
i
see
im
the
minority
here
on
this
review
i
live
in
a
state
that
makes
furious
this
beer
could
not
even
be
considered
furiouss
inbred
cousin
skip
it
overy
drinkable
and
satisfying
o
not
may
favorite
red
ale
but
far
from
bad
i
actually
think
it
is
pretty
good
and
would
drink
another
overall
a
very
good
red
ale
for
anyone
not
expecting
a
bland
killians
a
delight
for
a
hop
head
d
the
drinkability
here
is
pretty
good
it
has
nice
flavor
and
it
goes
down
easy
i
expected
this
one
to
be
a
little
more
hoppy
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
id
try
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pay
for
it
again
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
the
only
reason
i
didnt
plow
through
the
six
pack
i
bought
is
so
i
could
savor
each
bottle
i
would
buy
this
beer
all
the
time
were
it
available
in
maine
for
now
ill
just
have
to
continue
to
make
regular
trips
to
nh
good
beer
i
think
i
prefer
the
west
coast
ipa
for
the
sharper
hops
intensity
d
just
a
delicious
palate
wrecker
i
really
enjoyed
this
d
im
am
really
diggin
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
else
from
one
outstanding
brewery
this
beer
measures
up
to
their
west
coast
ipa
and
stout
i
highly
recomend
malty
hoppy
smell
with
some
fruit
notes
coming
through
as
well
taste
is
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
much
bigger
and
maltier
than
i
expected
lots
of
sweetness
comes
through
from
the
malt
overall
a
very
clean
beer
that
packs
some
great
flavors
aftertaste
lasts
for
a
solid
20
seconds
as
the
hops
go
on
and
on
while
ive
not
been
terribly
impressed
with
green
flash
brews
in
the
past
this
one
is
nicely
bitter
and
tasty
definitely
recommend
dim
not
a
huge
red
ale
fan
but
i
went
into
this
openminded
just
not
as
wellput
together
as
i
had
hoped
well
done
guys
this
is
an
above
average
amber
that
ill
be
drinking
again
drinkabilty
it
felt
a
little
stronger
then
6
which
was
impressive
you
could
drink
many
at
a
sitting
for
sure
its
very
soild
but
lacks
something
to
push
it
over
the
top
maybe
more
malts
another
good
beer
from
west
coast
but
not
there
best
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
a
decentsized
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
pine
and
grapefruit
hops
i
also
get
some
malt
mixed
in
mainly
bread
with
a
little
bit
of
toffee
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
bread
and
biscuit
malt
with
some
pine
from
the
hops
there
is
also
some
grapefruit
and
other
tropical
fruit
mixed
in
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
aroma
seems
pretty
linear
only
some
light
unidentifiable
hops
and
only
a
faint
whiff
of
that
characteristic
amber
malt
profile
the
taste
however
is
a
little
more
smooth
in
comparison
slight
sting
of
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
lemon
peel
and
brown
sugar
taste
concludes
with
bitter
orange
bitter

to

certainly
a

but
not
my
favorite
green
flash
lagunitas
lucky

still
wins
my
heart
with
red
ales
d
nothing
unique
about
this
one
its
a
solid
drink
one
that
i
could
throw
down
with
a
bunch
of
friends
and
have
a
good
time
mthe
body
is
unfiltered
and
gritty
fitting
the
aggressive
hop
explosion
very
well
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sweet
malty
finish
make
is
an
awesome
go
to
beer
when
youre
in
a
hoppy
mood
great
ill
drink
the
other
bottle
i
have
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
more
of
this
beer
green
flash
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
mostly
miss
ballast
point
is
still
king
of
the
san
diego
scene
in
my
eyes
pours
a
really
nice
dark
amberdeep
red
grapefruit
color
with
a
big
offwhite
head
great
lacing
and
retention
grapefruit
aroma
hint
of
sweet
malt
as
well
pretty
big
hop
bitterness
to
start
some
hidden
citrus
hops
but
mostly
big
pine
and
earthy
notes
this
is
followed
by
a
thick
creamy
caramel
malt
with
just
a
speckle
of
toffee
flavor
hop
bitterness
comes
full
circle
on
the
finish
d
overall
much
better
than
the
green
flash
west
coast
ipa
but
still
overly
hopped
with
a
solid
malt
balance
i
cant
say
its
worth
the
a
rating
but
at
least
its
drinkable
the
theory
behind
this
beer
is
that
the
sweet
malt
characteristics
of
a
red
ale
would
balance
out
a
substantial
ipa
bitterness
and
a
huge
ipa
dry
hopping
for
the
most
part
this
works
but
sometimes
the
hops
overrun
the
malty
body
the
body
has
a
medium
consistency
but
still
hints
at
oily
hops
the
malts
are
indeed
sweet
and
bold
but
each
sip
easily
yields
to
floral
and
piny
hops
several
minutes
after
a
sip
my
mouth
still
tastes
like
it
was
dry
hopped
which
is
spectacular
for
a
hoplover
like
me
but
probably
wont
work
for
everybody
this
is
definitely
an
intriguing
beer
but
you
shouldnt
try
hop
head
unless
you
qualify
as
one
try
this
beer
rerevisited
again

still
great
stuff
d
i
like
it
great
example
of
how
a
beer
should
be
built
for
a
hop
lover
wow
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
fantastic
hops
are
there
in
force
but
the
malt
caramel
and
orange
are
there
as
well
really
well
done
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
beer
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
the
mouthfeel
is
also
fantastic
hoppy
creamy
caramel
bitter
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
some
roasted
malt
in
there
as
well
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
i
think
i
would
stop
at
two
for
maximum
enjoyment
i
love
the
green
flash
west
coast
ipa
so
i
figured
id
love
this
one
too
great
beer
that
i
will
definitely
pick
up
again
d
heavy
malt
base
make
this
quite
filling
and
the
spicy
alcohol
character
and
hop
bitternessresin
make
this
a
slow
drinker
for
just
6
alcohol
in
terms
of
palate
carbonation
is
pretty
strong
and
aftertaste
is
nicely
clean
and
bitter
love
the
body
of
it
as
it
is
smoothly
solid
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
i
know
this
tastes
more
along
the
lines
of
a
pale
ale
with
the
large
hop
profile
however
this
has
to
be
the
best
red
ale
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
thought
between
the
hops
and
malt
but
nonetheless
an
awesome
tasting
beer
highly
sessionable
d
i
was
a
supreme
advocate
of
hop
heavy
ipas
i
know
this
is
technically
a
red
ale
however
now
a
find
balance
is
what
ive
been
appreciating
more
this
beer
is
a
fine
balance
of
what
youd
look
for
with
lots
of
west
coast
hopping
with
a
good
malt
base
lacks
a
bit
in
complexity

poured
a

with
pale

and
had
a
thin
bubbly
head
leaving
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
there
was
lost
of
piney

hops
in
the
aroma
with
plenty
of
malty

citrusy

and
mild
boozy
notes
the
piney
hop
character
was
also
dominating
the
palate
with
cirusy
nutty
caramel
grassy
accents
and
a
good
sweet
malty
balance
but
had
a
touch
of
booze
to
round
out
this
brew
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
citrusy
piney
hoppy
slighty
nutty
and
crisp
finish
it
was
drinking
very
good
and
was
really
tasty
this
brew
was
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
when
i
hit
the
brewpub
this
past
weekend
d
excellent
i
had
this
after
my
disappointing
encounter
with
a
northwest
brands
ipa
and
it
reassured
my
confidence
in
west
coasters
ability
to
craft
damn
fine
hoppy
beers
even
if
it
technically
is
a
red
maybe
not
had
half
the
brew
by
itself
and
finished
the
rest
of
it
with
spicy
stir
fry
awesome
pairing
tastetoasted
malt
caramel
good
strong
hop
bite
that
follows
you
to
the
finish
a
tasty
hoppy
red
ale
that
would
be
a
good
match
for
spicy
fare
buffalo
wings
or
tacos
come
to
mind
overall
this
beer
is
trying
to
do
too
much
the
overall
hoppiness
balanced
with
the
red
ale
style
gives
a
less
refreshing
and
more
palate
confusing
beer
it
is
interesting
and
there
are
some
unique
flavors
here
but
it
seems
to
be
just
off
the
mark
overall
an
exceptional
amber
ale
and
one
of
my
favourite
us
beers
d
pretty
good
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
it
pours
a
dark
red
and
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
im
a
fan
of
the
taste
throughout
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
would
recomend
m
soft
mouthfeel
but
a
very
thin
watery
beer
d
pretty
decent
session
beer
not
noticing
any
strong
alcohol
taste
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
offereing
from
green
flash
i
would
drink
it
again
forsher
popurs
a
deep
rusty
red
thats
slightly
hazy
with
some
yeast
floaties
meandering
about
light
tan
head
doesnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
abundant
with
both
grapefruit
and
caramel
theres
also
some
floral
hoppiness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
this
extends
into
the
taste
as
well
it
doesnt
really
get
to
a
point
where
one
smell
or
taste
dominates
the
other
pretty
well
balanced
i
guess
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
pine
personally
but
it
is
there
if
you
look
for
it
rich
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
resinous
feel
to
this
medium
leaning
toward
full
bodied
beer
goes
down
extremely
easy
while
i
appreciate
the
well
balanced
nature
of
this
beer
with
a
name
like
hop
head
i
expected
it
to
be
completely
hop
dominant
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
i
was
just
hoping
for
a
different
profile
d
higher
than
i
would
expect
from
the
smell
smoother
drink
than
your
average
red
ale
another
great
green
flash
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
im
especially
glad
that
i
had
it
on
tap
everything
about
it
was
enjoyable
including
the
color
and
head
on
this
beer
which
was
superb
and
perfect
also
worth
noting
is
that
this
beer
has
an
ipa
almost
dipa
feel
to
it
wet
versus
dry
mouthful
medium
to
full
bodied
in
flavor
slight
amount
of
alcohol
heat
mixed
with
a
wave
of
fresh
pinefilled
hops
very
refreshing
a
meal
in
a
bottle
i
know
because
it
was
my
dinner
tonight
heady
brewing
company
like
a
hoppy
founders
who
makes
excelent
similarly
priced
malty
beers
great
refreshing
beer
from
green
flash
i
got
my
daily
hop
fix
from
this
one
drink
a
really
good
brew
it
reminded
me
of
a
scaled
down
version
of
pliny
the
elder
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
every
serious
hop
head
needs
to
check
out
that
said
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
maltier
i
like
reds
for
the
malt
and
even
though
i
expected
this
to
be
hoppy
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
hoppy
still
definitely
worth
checking
out
and
ill
probably
end
up
having
this
guy
again
cheers
d
a
little
underwhelming
as
mentioned
in
the
taste
i
would
characterize
this
as
one
of
many
hop
bombs
out
there
nothing
much
distinguishes
this
from
the
masses
and
im
not
sure
what
is
red
about
this
apart
from
the
color
but
it
also
has
decent
drinkability
so
i
cant
hate
on
it
too
much
my
only
critique
is
that
its
a
little
unoriginal
and
it
fails
to
deliver
as
a
red
ale
overall
a
nice
balanced
red
ale
12oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
murky
rust
color
with
some
sediment
floating
around
no
head
and
some
good
lacing
great
aroma
of
piney
hops
slight
hint
of
malts
taste
is
more
of
that
big
hop
aroma
a
good
piney
flavor
with
a
nice
bitterness
this
is
a
great
hoppy
red
ale
hop
head
red
is
one
of
those
beers
that
strikes
you
because
it
keeps
up
the
high
hopping
levels
that
i
love
in
a
beer
while
teaming
it
with
a
great
malt
profile
that
supports
the
beer
and
the
hops
the
pour
is
good
with
a
nice
fluffy
offwhite
head
contrasting
with
the
red
body
the
aroma
combines
those
citrussy
west
coast
hops
with
a
light
bit
of
malt
and
unfortunately
a
touch
of
dustiness
the
flavour
comes
down
to
a
balance
between
citrussy
piney
resinous
hops
and
the
caramel
toffee
malts
of
the
red
ale
the
body
is
neither
thick
nor
insipid
which
is
nice
in
a
beer
like
this
and
it
helps
to
make
it
feel
like
you
can
drink
more
when
ipas
have
gotten
too
monotonous
this
is
a
great
beer
to
turn
to
d
even
though
very
good
this
is
really
the
only
category
that
leaves
something
to
be
desired
while
these
are
very
easy
to
drink
i
feel
they
could
sit
a
wee
bit
better
with
my
palette
overall
an
amazing
brew
d
well
hidden
abv
and
just
plain
drinkable
can
have
2
bombers
easily
and
would
want
more
one
of
the
styles
australian
breweries
just
do
not
do
and
they
should
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
until
i
fall
over
anyway
drinkability
is
high
good
solid
flavor
and
the
abv
is
reasonable
to
session
the
price
is
high
for
this
brewer
in
my
area
which
doesnt
necessarily
influence
my
score
but
is
a
little
unfortunate
excellent
drinkability
the
flavors
are
a
little
two
dimensional
but
each
element
is
executed
extremely
well
i
wasnt
expecting
this
brew
to
make
as
much
of
an
impression
as
the
west
coast
ipa
but
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
is
a
nice
solid
mediumbodied
beer
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
going
down
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
extremely
balanced
beer
that
is
not
too
heavy
and
flat
out
nice
all
the
way
around
d
drinkability
is
relatively
high
nothing
really
detracts
from
the
beer
too
much
and
is
balanced
to
the
point
of
preserving
the
palate
but
it
doesnt
really
push
any
envelopes
for
a
beer
in
this
price
point
id
definitely
be
looking
for
more
distinguishing
characteristics
the
beer
is
good
but
not
really
memorable
poured
with
a
giant
foamy
frothy
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
lots
of
big
bubble
trails
and
loads
of
lace
color
is
an
almost
clear
red
medium

aroma
is
hop
grapefruit
pine
and
a
little

flavor
is
like
aroma
plus
a
little
butter
wet
leather
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
very
long
with
lingering
hop
bitterness
not
as
balanced
as
id
prefer
but
not
bad
dont
think
ill
have
another
for
a
while
imho
this
drinks
like
a
good
brown
ale
that
has
a
generous
addition
of
hops
makes
it
interesting
not
a
bad
brew
if
you
like
both
brown
ales
and
hoppy
style
brews
d
a
nice
beer
all
around
a
really
tasty

the

a
fan

fresh

is
able

pair
with
most
foods

the
intensity
of

here
are
comparable
to
those
of

in

of

with
a
lively
almost
prickly
carbonation
and
some
astringency
that
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
along
the
cheeks
a
very
good
amber
perhaps
a
little
slanted
towards
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
but
solid
and
quite
drinkable
i
was
slumming
around
looking
for
the
last
remnants
of
some
nugget
nectar
i
was
able
to
pick
some
up
last
weekend
but
i
guess
that
was
the
end
so
i
came
across
this
so
called
red
ipa
overall
a
good
beer
first
pour
was
excellent
dark
amber
with
a
great
lasting
head
first
taste
was
very
caramel
and
malt
with
a
hoppy
after
taste
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
as
drinking
continued
it
lost
the
sweet
and
hung
on
to
the
bitter
without
the
spice
notes
of
solid
hops
and
more
bitter
from
unripened
citrus
i
would
recommend
if
you
cant
find
the
nectar
but
not
at
all
its
replacement
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
something
i
would
recommend
to
try
poured
a
reddish
amber
as
suggested
lots
of
head
and
great
lacing
through
the
glass
tons
of
citrus
hop
aromas
actually
balnced
nice
beer
had
a
soapy
finish
but
it
did
not
ruin
the
beer
very
nice
nice
mouthfeel
slightly
sticky
with
medium
carbonation
level
that
complements
the
beer
nicely
the
hops
faded
too
fast
and
the
malt
was
a
bit
boring
to
keep
me
intrigued
though
there
is
little
to
no
alcohol
burn
and
no
off
flavors
or
anything
detrimental
it
just
comes
up
a
bit
short
of
being
amazing
above
average
yah
pours
a
lovely
redish
brown
color
with
perfect
cap
of
soapy
off
white
head
good
retention
and
amazingly
sticky
lacing
scent
is
hops
hops
and
more
hops
heavy
notes
of
pine
aggressive
rye
like
spice
fresh
cut
grass
herbal
tea
taste
brings
exactly
what
the
scent
dictated
hugely
aggressive
hoping
very
fresh
but
simply
off
putting
faint
notes
of
a
heavy
carmel
backbone
do
little
to
cover
the
taste
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
coating
presence
and
long
libgering
spicy
aftertaste
not
for
me
at
all
appearance
is
a
darker
redamber
good
amount
of
carb
nice
1
fingers
worth
of
whitereddish
head
smells
are
caramel
malts
slight
citrus
and
pine
hops
tastes
are
sweet5
malts
then
hops
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
good
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thick
and
syrupy
drinkability
is
good
i
have
to
remember
this
one
first
rate
hop
head
stuff
d
a
good
red
to
be
sure
hop
head
blends
the
hops
and
malts
nicely
together
without
being
on
one
side
or
the
other
this
would
pair
well
with
some
original
brats
and
crisp
fall
weather
o
beer
is
refreshing
and
delicious
and
very
easy
to
drink
in
my
opinion
it
is
up
there
in
the
style
this
battle
founders
reds
rye
pa
for
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
i
dont
love
red
ales
but
this
is
a
really
good
beernot
nuggetnectargoodbut
really
good
definitely
a
mishmash
of
styles
a
decent
red
ale
hopped
to
the
nuts
tasty
stuff
this
was
my
first
green
flash
beer
and
if
the
rest
of
theirs
are
as
good
as
this
one
ill
definitely
become
a
follower
there
should
be
more
beers
like
this
im
tired
pours
dark
muddy
red
like
ocean
clay
topped
by
milky
offwhite
head
gorgeous
aroma
of
citrus
notes
wet
hops
grass
mint
lemon
and
soap
deep
flavor
of
hops
citrus
spice
lemon
some
soap
some
earth
in
the
aftertaste
thick
in
mouthfeel
with
medium
carb
but
highly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
for
any
season
a
great
accompaniment
to
my
turkey
dinner
as
well
real
good
ale
a
nice
drinkable
caramel
malt
amber
ale
hopped
to
what
seems
like
70
ibus
a
most
enjoyable
brew
if
you
like
amber
ales
and
hops
pours
a
deep
dark
red
two
finger
head
which
quickly
disappeared
good
amount
of
malt
carmel
citrusy
thick
bodied
good
balance
on
the
bitterness
just
gets
better
as
it
warms
very
drinkable
theres
just
something
about
amber
beers
that
are
hopped
up
that
i
definately
like
easy
drinking
but
unique
enough
to
want
to
savor
pours
a
beutiful
cloudy
brick
color
nice
foamy
head
with
delicate
lacing
nose
is
a
strong
hoppy
smell
not
unlike
their
west
coast
ipa
this
is
obviously
a
blend
of
styles
as
theyve
brought
ipa
like
hoppiness
to
the
often
moribund
red
ale
category
as
with
all
blends
however
there
are
compromises
this
is
especially
notable
in
the
maltiness
which
tends
to
neutralize
the
complexity
that
is
so
successful
in
the
wcipa
still
it
is
an
excellent
looking
beer
which
elevates
the
often
lame
red
ale
to
a
higher
status
while
id
choose
the
wcipa
over
this
one
its
still
a
damn
fine
effort
all
aspects
of
this
beer
were
solid
yet
unspectacular
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
pick
other
green
flash
brews
over
this
one
if
i
had
the
choice
a
red
ipa
as
the
label
succintly
suggested
so
nice
drinks
way
hoppier
than
the
45
ibus
might
not
quite
be
up
to
rocket
red
though
big
whipped
up
head
passing
two
fingers
mixture
of
all
bubble
sizes
craters
as
much
as
dimples
basic
tan
to
eggshell
white
color
better
retention
than
youd
think
given
the
larger
bubbles
plenty
of
small
splashes
of
lacing
here
and
there
nicely
rich
amber
color
fully
opaque
slightly
more
orange
at
the
rims
tiny
beads
here
and
there
looks
like
there
could
be
a
catfish
living
in
there
the
nose
has
a
welcome
relaxed
quality
about
it
semilaconic
unfolding
of
malts
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
segueing
into
pine
sweet
and
sour
grapefruit
to
orange
citrus
spring
blossoms
and
a
croissant
danish
flakiness
the
green
nature
of
the
hops
bristles
without
lunging
for
your
jugular
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
adds
a
slow
churn
that
allows
for
both
palate
pressure
and
measured
pacing
forward
this
is
a
dry
and
hoppy
beer
no
doubt
simply
not
out
to
bludgeon
you
with
the
fact
gets
grassy
and
piney
while
always
leaving
room
for
chocolate
toffee
bread
and
caramel
orange
to
white
grapefruit
citrus
is
tight
and
lean
neither
decisively
sweet
nor
sour
the
apricot
peach
nectarine
pineapple
green
apple
fruit
ekes
out
a
marginal
presence
not
a
focal
point
its
not
keenly
balanced
but
better
for
it
particularly
with
the
general
lack
of
pushiness
a
hop
head
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
be
a
hop
head
to
enjoy
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
it
would
be
fresh
from
the
source
or
on
tap
this
is
one
of
those
wow
beers
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
poured
into
my
sam
adams
glass
loved
the
scarlet
red
opaque
translucent
glow
after
of
course
being
greeted
by
a
nice
floral
citrusy
resinous
amarillo
hop
whiffscall
it
a
wow
beer
cause
i
couldnt
stop
saying
wow
this
is
nice
how
nice
the
only
other
beer
that
i
know
uses
amarillos
like
this
is
gumballhead
they
are
a
nice
fruity
hop
grapefruity
hop
with
a
slightly
spicey
edge
to
them
this
beer
has
a
great
balance
to
it
for
such
a
hoppy
ale
due
to
the
reddish
malts
which
add
a
touch
of
sweetness
beer
has
a
thick
rocky
head
with
lacing
that
sticks
all
of
over
the
glass
the
beer
is
not
so
much
just
another
big
ipa
but
complex
red
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
with
oilyness
from
all
the
drop
hopping
i
cant
say
these
are
extremely
drinkable
at
6
4
abv
cause
there
is
a
thickness
to
this
one
you
owe
yourself
a
six
pack
of
these
now
as
i
mentioned
before
this
beer
has
an
identity
crisis
its
either
an
extremely
hoppy
american
red
ale
or
an
ipa
with
a
strange
flavor
profile
neither
of
these
would
be
a
bad
thing
especially
because
these
two
styles
have
a
lot
in
common
but
by
straddling
them
both
this
beer
ends
up
a
bit
bland
id
like
to
have
it
again
but
since
green
flash
already
makes
a
really
nice
ipa
id
probably
just
be
content
with
that
d
the
fact
that
the
hoppiness
sits
on
your
tongue
prevents
you
from
knocking
back
a
few
but
one
or
two
would
not
be
a
problem
at
all
d
pretty
good
but
the
sweetness
keeps
it
from
being
a
knockout
for
me
bought
a
single
beginning
to
think
i
shouldve
got
the
6pack
this
and
their
west
coast
ipa
make
a
great
tag
team
d
dry
finish
to
compliment
the
sweetness
quite
drinkable
excellent
beer
a
must
try
if
you
havent
yet
if
the
color
wasnt
red
it
could
have
been
a
dipa
for
my
behalf
a
highly
hopped
amber
ale
that
lacked
the
dusty
notes
that
i
sometimes
find
in
amber
ales
notes
very
nice
amber
ale
and
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
overall
a
really
solid
offering
from
green
flash
a
red
ale
combined
with
some
ipa
qualities
this
one
is
plenty
hoppy
with
more
bitterness
than
the
ibu
suggested
one
id
have
again
for
sure
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
pours
a
tawny
1finger
head
that
dies
slowly
on
top
of
a
reddish
brown
body
more
hoppy
than
malty
in
the
aroma
leafy
citric
hops
are
prevelant
but
still
some
mild
caramel
sweet
malt
in
there
as
well
if
you
want
an
ipahop
fix
with
your
reds
go
w
this
beer
bc
while
their
is
mild
sweet
malt
and
a
biscuitybreadiness
there
for
a
slightly
chewey
medium
body
there
is
a
distinct
hop
bite
that
is
sharp
and
leads
to
a
real
dry
finish
a
good
beer
but
its
more
of
a
mild
ipa
than
a
redamble
ale
d
very
drinkable
with
the
good
taste
lightish
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
flavorful
finish
one
of
the
better
wellhopped
red
ales
the
bottle
says
they
used
amarillo
hops
for
the
dry
hopping
comparable
to
a
founders
centenial
ipa
d
the
nice
complexity
of
malt
and
big
full
green
hops
makes
this
big
beer
very
drinkable
the
fruity
sweetness
compliments
the
hops
but
the
dry
malt
flavors
keep
it
crisp
with
a
nice
depth
d
for
a
red
ale
it
definitely
has
character
not
very
sessionable
though
because
the
hops
dried
out
my
mouth
after
a
glass
however
i
would
buy
it
again
for
sure
overall
a
very
solid
beer
from
g
f
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
out
over
the
ipa
but
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
great
blending
of
malt
flavors
here
if
youre
at
all
curious
dont
hesistate
to
give
this
one
a
try
dgreat
refreshment
on
a
hot
day
a
nice
switch
from
the
ipas
ive
been
addicted
to
lately
while
still
staying
with
hoppy
beers
thumbs
up
to
my
second
green
flash
brew
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
an
average
fizzy
white
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
good
lacing
good
citrus
hoppy
malty
aroma
medium
body
with
slick
texture
heavy
bittersweet
smooth
flavor
with
a
medium
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
good
brew
redish
amber
color
with
a
lasting
finger
of
head
this
is
a
very
balanced
beer
with
alot
more
hops
then
any
other
red
ale
ive
yet
had
but
after
the
initial
sip
the
hops
fade
and
malt
is
still
lingering
with
a
caramel
sweetness
and
im
getting
some
cinnamon
and
spices
hidden
in
there
as
well
there
is
a
subtle
earthyness
or
mineral
quality
in
there
which
i
cant
tell
if
its
from
the
malt
used
or
water
but
most
likely
the
malt
the
mouth
feel
has
a
lightmedium
carbination
that
fades
with
the
hops
into
a
smooth
light
syrupy
texture
and
doesnt
leave
the
cleanest
feeling
this
beer
has
a
pleasing
aroma
and
flavor
profile
but
for
my
subjective
tastes
is
lacking
the
mouthfeel
i
desire
to
get
through
more
then
a
single
bottle
in
a
sitting
d
this
beer
can
be
considered
sessionable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
overall
another
winner
from
green
flash
do
they
brew
a
beer
that
is
just
average
i
dont
think
so
they
always
brew
stuff
that
is
good
great
or
blows
me
away
and
this
beer
was
great
one
of
the
better
ambers
ive
had
but
nothing
special
overall
d
aftertaste
fades
quickly
actually
too
quickly
agaist
the
amber
style
i
quite
like
it
but
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
an
ipa
it
is
surely
a
more
middle
ground
green
flash
makes
great
beer
what
is
it
about
san
diego
d
very
nice
hoppy
example
of
a
red
i
love
this
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
goes
down
well
but
does
leave
a
bitter
aftertaste
it
is
harsh
and
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
have
a
glass
of
water
nearby
just
to
make
sure
it
make
not
feel
too
bitter
a
great
hop
experience
all
in
all
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
great
aroma
and
a
change
from
the
usual
ipa
for
a
hoppy
fix
id
have
it
again
although
id
probably
be
more
likely
to
go
for
their
west
coast
ipa
notes
wow
what
a
hop
bomb
i
am
dam
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
cheers
d
i
could
drink
these
all
evening
if
i
didnt
have
to
wake
up
for
work
i
hope
theres
hop
head
in
heaven
d
a
very
delicious
example
of
the
style
fairlynice
complexity
in
an
emerging
style
that
is
one
of
my
favorites
one
finger
tan
head
fairly
slow
dissipation
significant
lacing
reddish
amber
clear
body
multiple
trails
of
carbonation
rising
from
bottom
of
the
glass
pretty
balanced
nose
caramel
malts
vs
piney
and
floral
hops
neither
dominates
taste
is
pretty
sweet
up
front
a
bit
of
melon
sweetness
but
sharp
hop
hit
in
the
middle
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
mouthfeel
is
full
good
effervescence
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
red
ale
but
certainly
quite
tasty
a
nice
san
diego
interpretation
of
the
style
recommended
d
good
drinkablity
one
that
i
would
get
again
i
like
the
22oz
format
which
is
good
for
sampling
and
sharing
with
friends
drinkability
hopheads
delight
definitely
not
a
typical
amber
ale
but
i
like
green
flashs
holdnothingback
approach
with
the
hops
but
the
monster
hop
flavor
slows
me
down
a
little
bit
d
in
small
amounts
sure
this
is
true
to
its
name
but
make
sure
its
what
you
want
also
id
like
to
do
another
rating
on
this
when
i
grab
another
bottle
right
now
at
a
b
id
like
to
take
a
bit
more
time
to
really
take
this
one
in
drink
this
can
be
very
tough
to
drink
or
very
easy
depending
on
how
you
drink
it
the
bitterness
can
be
overwhelming
if
you
let
it
build
up
on
your
palate
as
to
be
expected
from
a
beer
dubbed
hop
head
a
careful
tasting
will
find
a
lot
more
in
the
rich
malt
character
than
if
its
gulped
down
in
a
session
d
a
decent
amber
hoppy
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
the
fruit
or
the
malt
but
something
comes
in
a
bit
sharp
for
me
im
just
being
picky
here
though
a
great
beer
overall
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
present
which
gives
way
to
some
nice
lacing
lots
of
sediment
is
present
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
pine
hops
over
top
of
a
backbone
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
malts
the
taste
has
a
solid
sweet
and
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
hint
of
rye
up
front
cirtus
hops
hit
you
with
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
isnt
dry
though
like
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
amber
ale
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
and
aroma
to
keep
you
interested
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
over
and
over
notes
i
like
my
hoppy
reds
to
have
a
stronger
malt
foundation
this
is
good
stuff
just
not
my
preference
for
the
style
call
it
a
san
diego
red
ale
and
it
makes
sense
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
has
enough
teeth
to
it
to
not
make
you
need
more
d
a
very
nice
hoppy
offering
from
green
flash
lives
up
to
its
name
this
one
leans
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
to
consider
it
highly
drinkable
but
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
bit
more
balance
than
their
west
coast
ipa
my
bottle
may
not
be
very
fresh
so
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
to
see
the
difference
in
the
hop
profile
pretty
good
if
you
like
your
ambers
hoppy
maybe
this
bottle
was
not
up
to
snuff
as
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
red
will
have
to
rereview
if
i
can
get
it
vom
fass
or
frisch
abgefüllt
d
i
would
be
more
than
willing
to
review
this
again
maybe
on
tap
this
was
just
a
disappointing
experience
for
me
really
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
because
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
were
so
good
as
well
as
the
malt
tastes
however
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
couldnt
really
see
my
self
having
another
d
good
hoppy
red
ale
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
overall
a
powerful
punchy
wellbalanced
beer
like
many
of
the
wellreviewed
ambers
its
a
little
hopsforward
for
the
style
but
the
hop
flavors
are
beautiful
and
complex
poured
into
a
straightsided
pint
glass
very
hazy
red
lots
of
lace
smells
of
fruity
amarillo
hops
but
not
as
much
as
i
thought
it
might
very
smooth
with
fruity
hop
flavors
caramel
and
coffee
in
the
mix
fruity
soft
moderately
bitter
finish
a
touch
oxidized
very
drinkable
hop
was
generally
more
fruity
than
specifically
citrusy
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
lower
alcohol
american
barleywine
it
about
as
rich
and
sweet
as
it
could
be
to
maintain
a
good
level
of
drinkability
but
i
had
no
problem
with
this
one
nice
hop
character
bold
but
not
harsh
or
enough
to
overwhelm
the
malts
really
great
beer
mouthfeel
remains
consistent
but
weakens
in
a
tiny
amount
drinkable
maybe
not
for
a
typical
red
drinker
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
this
is
drinkable
but
not
as
balanced
as
my
favorite
ambers
if
you
want
hops
without
any
complexity
this
one
is
for
you
notes
a
unique
beer
that
grew
on
me
more
as
it
warmed
the
last
13
of
the
beer
was
amazing
the
medium
to
full
body
was
nice
and
sticky
and
had
a
fluffy
cottony
texture
the
carbonation
was
sharp
and
the
finish
was
dry
and
tingly
this
beer
beer
seems
the
perfect
hybrid
of
a
good
ipa
and
a
full
flavored
rich
red
ale
awesome
beer
d
an
out
of
style
hop
forward
red
ale
made
for
hop
lovers
well
i
liked
it
but
it
wasnt
great
to
me
i
was
very
disappointed
in
the
absence
of
the
malts
in
the
both
aromataste
i
suppose
i
could
drink
a
couple
pints
before
i
grew
tired
of
it
but
if
i
want
an
amber
than
okay
if
i
want
an
ipa
than
ill
get
one
i
have
to
say
this
one
didnt
please
me
great
brewery
i
loved
there
ipa
but
i
still
dont
recommend
it
ive
always
liked
a
wellhopped
red
but
this
is
the
first
one
that
really
matches
the
intense
bitterness
and
aroma
a
lot
of
topnotch
pales
feature
i
dont
if
its
the
darker
and
sweeter
malts
that
drown
it
out
in
other
beers
but
for
once
the
hops
stand
out
and
make
this
a
hop
heads
red
it
pours
with
a
nice
light
offwhite
head
and
light
to
medium
amber
color
naturally
the
flavors
change
as
the
beer
goes
on
and
by
the
end
the
hops
mellow
and
you
get
more
of
the
caramel
character
you
normally
see
in
a
red
ale
worth
a
pint
or
two
at
any
bar
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
grapefruit
citrus
caramel
some
pine
and
pepper
ends
a
little
bitter
i
would
reccomend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
red
ales
or
ipas
as
i
feel
it
is
a
near
perfect
blend
of
these
two
styles
d
very
drinkable
i
would
not
hesitate
to
recomend
this
to
ipa
fans
or
anyone
for
that
matter
i
would
definately
buy
this
beer

also
has
a

of
floating
sediment
has
a
onefinger
light
tan
head
that
seems
to
have
good
retention
and
left
some
good
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
here
is
strong
of
hops
and
they
are
very
enticing
the
dry
hopping
with
the
amarillo
gives
a
nice
floral
scent
in
the
background
i
think
i
am
picking
up
some
roasted
and
caramel
malt
aromas
the
flavor
is
very
good
hops
dominate
and
give
a
real
nice
flavor
very
floral
in
flavor
and
seem
to
tail
off
to
a
almost
tea
like
flavor
the
hop
resin
seems
to
coat
the
tongue
and
wants
to
stick
around
as
for
several
minutes
after
i
still
taste
hops
the
malt
is
hard
to
pin
point
except
for
a
sweet
feel
that
is
there
while
this
brew
is
not
balanced
imo
it
does
have
a
great
flavor
profile
and
is
easy
to
drink

has

but
they

im
rating
this
in
terms
of
an
ipa
because
im
not
getting
enough
of
the
maltiness
of
a
red
ale
to
real
label
it
as
such
this
beer
doesnt
have
enough
red

character
and
the

brewer
in

country
of
so
many
of
them
easily
one
of
my
favorite

beers

so
good

you
like
hops

course
if
not
why
are
you
trying

beer
called

this

ale
lots

flavors

hops
are
definitely
in
the
front
decent
mouthfeel

not
my
style

hopping
a
very
hoppy
deliciously
bittersweet
red

the
beer
pours
bright
red
with

that
leaves
behind
quite
a
bit

the
smell
is
superb
lots
of
hops
and
lots
of

the
hops
smell
oily

citric

theres
some
spice
maybe
coriander
seed
the
taste

might

be

sucker
for
these
hoppy
beers
but
im
a
happy
sucker

does
a
good
job

this
beer
has

citric

caramel
malt
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
about
it
my
reviews
of
hopheavy
beers
tend
to
sound
similar
this
beer
has
a
strong
hop
flavor
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palette
quite
as
much
as
some
its
not
the
crisp
bitterness
of
stones
ruination
but
more
of
a
smooth
bittersweet
flavor
the
feel
is
nice
and
oily
from
the
hops
but
also
tends
to
get
a
bit
watery
on
the
finish
the
drinkability
is
good

it

sweet
malts
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
piny
spicy
hops
very
dry
but
with
sweet
malts
mixed
in
grapefruit
a
very
awesome
red
ale
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
red
in
my
opinion
but
good
whatever
you
call
it
glad
to
see
this
one
hit
texas
recommend
and
worth
an
occasional
spot
in
the
rotation
12
oz
bottle
nice
amber
looking
brew
with
bubbling
rising
to
the
top
of
a
pretty
decent
sized
head
smells
strongly
of
pine
and
caramel
malt
taste
follows
the
nose
with
hop
oil
caramel
malt
and
a
slight
roasted
edge
citrus
with
a
pear
like
sweetness
pretty
well
balanced
but
finishes
on
the
bitter
side
which
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
with
such
a
name
hop
cone
aroma
and
taste
is
dead
on
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
but
would
not
reccommend
drinking
more
delicately
flavored
brews
after
this
palate
crusher
medium
body
with
a
lovely
hop
bitterness
this
one
is
almost
like
big
hoppy
from
terrapin
except
better
and
more
tame
and
less
alcoholic
that
makes
no
sense
but
whatever
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
very
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
beer
is
pretty
malty
and
roasty
smelling
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
flavors
of
the
hops
are
more
noticeable
the
beer
has
the
roastymalty
qualities
i
expect
in
a
red
ale
married
with
the
hoppiness
of
a
good
ipa
not
bad
at
all
the
beer
is
surprisingly
soft
on
the
palate
and
i
get
almost
a
creamy
mouthfeel
on
the
finish
the
finish
is
impressively
long
and
bitter
d
im
intrigued
to
take
sips
because
green
flash
couldnt
have
made
something
i
dislike
this
much
could
they
they
did
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
a
delicious
hopjuice
brew
d
hoppy
for
an
amber
but
like
this
take
on
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
your
hops
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
red
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
off
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
on
the
ride
down
the
glass
lots
of
floaties
in
this
one
hop
residue
maybe
smells
of
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
tastes
of
citrus
and
pine
and
a
little
malt
shows
through
here
too
definitely
a
hop
forward
brew
with
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
resinous
oily
mouthfeel
medium
body
ample
carbonation
great
hop
juice
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
carmely
color
with
a
thin
head
the
nose
is
of
hops
malts
tones
a
slight
carmel
sweetness
and
mango
notes
this
brew
has
an
initial
taste
of
hoppy
bitterness
that
tastes
like
what
i
imagine
fresh
hop
juice
would
taste
like
and
finishes
with
a
citrus
peel
note
its
full
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
enjoyable
but
not
overwhelming
needed
a
bigger
finish
west
coast
ipa
remains
the
green
flash
fav
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
create
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
understand
why
this
won
gold
for
the
style
at
this
years
gabf
as
a
hop
head
i
love
these
style
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
good
amber
ale
as
the
name
implies
its
certainly
hoppier
than
most
but
theres
also
a
solid
malt
backbone
to
this
beer
worth
a
shot
drinkability
is
pretty
good
by
the
smell
alone
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
unfortunetly
the
taste
is
not
as
satisfying
and
while
it
packs
a
big
punch
in
a
small
package
its
not
my
ideal
for
the
hoppy
red
which
is
big
bright
resiny
hop
aroma
and
flavor
still
its
cheap
and
fresh
this
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
sales
associate
at
a
local
table
vine
after
i
was
looking
for
green
flash
west
coast
ipa
which
was
sold
out
being
somewhat
reluctant
to
try
this
brew
im
glad
i
did
the
smell
alone
told
me
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
great
ride
the
taste
was
even
better
it
is
hoppy
but
not
offensive
this
is
to
me
a
masterpiece
nearly
two
inches
of
bready
tan

rocky
as

leaving

a
brick
reddish
brown
nose

full
of
crisp
citrusy
hops
with
orange
rind
and
a
hint
of
piney
sweetness
initially
enters
the
mouth
with
a
sweetsmooth
almost
creamy
feel
a
layer
of
malt
comes
through
to
add
depth
and
nice
balance
then
the
hops
show
up
to
add
a
nice
little
even
bitter
bite
which
hangs
on
nicely
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
hop
feel
is
more
on
the
citrus
side
but
does
have
a
rustic
feel
also
mouthfeel
is
bold
and
thick
leaving
you
wanting
the
next
sip
wonderfully
drinkable
i
could
use
a
fridge
full
of
this
d
highly
drinkable
a
terrific
brew
at
6
i
would
still
consider
this
highly
sessionable

the
best
ive
had
in

trying
for
anyone
who
appreciates
well

looking

amazing
i
always
enjoy
a
hoppy
red
and
this
didnt
disappoint
i
may
have
to
try
and
get
my
hands
on
a
few
more
of
these
soon
thanks
for
the
bottle
russ
bottom
line
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
redamber
ales
ive
tasted
to
date
id
like
another
please
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
one
nice
hearty
red
ale
that
everyone
should
drink
m
d
a
full
bodied
brew
by
all
means
it
almost
goes
a
little
heavy
and
doesnt
seem
to
lighten
up
on
the
finish
making
it
feel
a
little
weighty
this
isnt
a
horrible
attribute
but
it
was
a
little
bit
unusual
i
found
that
said
i
could
do
another
the
hop
presence
does
do
a
number
on
the
palate
though
not
one
to
try
another
tasting
after
hop
head
reds
a
hell
of
a
good
beer
one
of
the
better
and
more
interesting
red
ales
ive
had
something
about
the
fine
hop
flavor
kept
me
wishing
for
a
little
more
bitterness
but
its
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
as
it
stands
definitely
recommended
d
nice
drinkability
i
could
go
for
a
few
here
with
an
ample
amount
of
complexity
for
a
red
as
well
hoppiness
afterthoughts
i
think
i
figured
out
what
bugged
me
about
this
beer
its
a
barleywine
lite
the
basic
characteristics
are
there
juicy
hop
oil
big
sweet
base
malt
but
it
doesnt
have
the
weight
to
carry
all
the
hops
leaving
it
seemly
thin
bitter
and
a
touch
too
sweet
d
goes
down
smooth
just
bitter
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
from
setting
in
would
do
well
in
the
long
hall
very
enjoyable
overall
better
than
average
for
my
tastes
this
brewery
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
drinkability
is
good
but
it
tastes
higher
than
6
for
some
reason
grapefruit
aroma
fom
the
fragrant
amarillo
initially
big
head
smooth
easy
drinking
i
can
just
picture
the
guzzlers
downing
6paks
a
nice
bitterness
that
is
left
on
the
aftertaste
well
balanced
at
45
ibu
a
fresh
and
bold
taste
can
use
to
transition
to
craft
overall
a
nice
hoppy
amber
style
brew
it
has
a
great
flavor
and
is
i
find
it
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
green
flash
continues
to
impress
bright
glowing
amber
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
medium
head
that
fades
somewhat
quickly
it
leaves
spots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
nice
fresh
hoppy
goodness
much
more
of
a
distinct
hop
presence
than
from
the
bottle
this
stuff
seems
super
fresh
or
maybe
its
just
that
different
ontap
juicy
citrusy
hops
lightly
sugared
and
quite
tasty
a
smaller
malt
base
than
the
bottled
version
as
well
just
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
biscuity
undertone
to
support
the
delicious
hops
a
nice
bitterness
with
light
dryness
good
carbonation
leaves
a
tickle
on
the
tongue
and
its
so
refreshing
that
you
cant
help
but
take
another
sip
soon
after
i
think
this
is
much
better
ontap
and
even
though
there
were
a
few
beers
i
had
yet
to
try
on
the
board
i
stuck
with
this
one
after
the
first
pint
great
stuff
that
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
its
sooo
well
balanced
the
hops
and
malt
are
perfectly
matched
and
neither
overpower
the
other
floral
citrusy
hops
and
toasty
cereal
malts
great
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
and
fades
quickly
a
great
session
beer
too
bad
i
only
have
one
on
tap
at
mission
pizza
in
fremont
wow
this
is
great
stuff
deep
red
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
paints
the
glass
with
some
very
impressive
lacework
all
the
way
down
malty
flavor
balanced
nicely
with
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
hops
definitely
make
their
presence
known
but
do
not
overwhelm
this
beer
as
is
the
case
with
many
other
green
flash
offerings
great
balance
medium
body
and
simply
a
terrific
quaff
for
a
hot
day
destined
to
be
a
heavy
rotation
beer
for
me
cheers
pours
a
nice
deep
red
color
with
some
orange
highlights
and
a
nice
unusually
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
nose
is
quite
hoppy
with
slight
biscuity
malt
taste
follows
with
quite
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
a
nice
citrus
hop
profile
with
a
decent
malt
presence
but
i
would
have
expected
a
bigger
sweetness
from
and
amberred
ale
good
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
dry
slightly
thin
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
if
your
a
hophead
that
is
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
tasting
clean
well
made
beer
i
always
debate
whether
or
not
to
reem
beers
like
this
though
because
to
me
this
is
more
like
a
red
ipa
ala
mars
celebration
furious
etc
than
it
is
like
your
average
stereotypical
amberred
ale
although
there
are
some
amber
ale
characteristics
in
this
they
clearly
wanted
to
express
the
hops
in
this
one
as
stated
on
the
label
so
i
gave
it
an
honest
rating
as
they
let
me
know
hey
this
red
ale
has
some
hops
really
though
who
gives
a
shit
what
the
actual
style
is
if
the
beer
tastes
great
which
this
one
does
so
go
get
some
its
good
drinkability
one
of
the
better
green
flash
brews
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
is
of
course
nice
and
low
6
making
for
a
sessionable
and
tasty
beer
the
bitterness
may
perhaps
be
a
little
high
45
ibus
which
covers
up
a
few
of
what
i
imagine
are
some
pretty
tasty
hop
notes
but
by
and
large
its
a
pretty
tasty
brew
poured
into
a
12oz
mug
this
beer
is
a
fairly
dark
reddishmahogany
color
only
a
small
head
forms
on
top
but
it
provides
modest
lacing
with
the
name
of
this
beer
the
aroma
is
hardly
unexpected
a
hugely
hoppy
nose
full
of
citrus
pineresin
notesbut
theres
also
some
sweet
lightly
caramel
malt
flavor
is
better
than
the
ipa
more
balanced
theres
still
a
very
high
bitterness
load
upon
load
of
hop
flavor
but
also
some
lightly
toasted
sweet
malt
the
sweetness
is
forcibly
dried
out
by
the
finish
but
it
still
makes
a
good
flavor
component
a
pretty
darn
good
ultrahoppy
ale
d
very
good
i
could
drink
several
of
these
probably
one
of
the
best
red
ales
i
have
had
if
you
like
hops
this
is
a
great
session
beer
6
alcohol
is
pretty
nice
though
if
it
was
higher
i
would
consider
this
an
american
strong
ale
most
of
the
hoppy
red
ales
ive
had
usually
hit
you
first
with
the
malt
then
the
hops
come
into
play
this
one
seems
to
be
the
opposite
the
citrus
hops
come
in
with
a
lot
of
grapefruit
and
it
is
followed
up
very
lightly
by
the
malt
id
say
the
malt
in
this
red
is
a
lot
less
pronounced
than
many
in
this
style
its
a
good
hoppy
beer
that
leaves
the
grapefruit
taste
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
this
beer
is
the
perfect
example
of
why
big
flavor
doesnt
necessarily
need
to
come
with
a
big
abv
or
big
price
tag
says
6
on
this
bottle
since
this
is
relatively
obtainable
i
might
just
buy
this
by
the
case
and
make
it
my
1
every
day
beer
perfectly
balanced
ridiculously
flavorful
completely
outstanding
had
a
pint
of
this
on
tap
at
blue
smoke
bbq
in
nyc
it
was
one
of
the
few
things
on
tap
that
i
hadnt
tried
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
conflicting
beer
for
me
i
like
red
ales
but
not
a
big
fan
of
the
heavy
hops
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
looks
innocent
enough
and
the
hops
are
certainly
the
signature
taste
hence
the
name
it
paired
well
with
the
spicy
chicken
we
were
eating
and
i
would
probably
drink
this
again
this
beer
is
well
done
and
although
the
strong
taste
of
hops
is
prevalent
its
not
overpowering
enough
to
take
away
from
the
beer
itself
this
is
a
god
beer
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
my
mind
among
the
other
hopped
up
reds
the
body
is
a
bit
thick
with
caramel
and
lightly
roasted
malts
the
hops
form
a
collection
of
pine
citrus
and
pineapple
flavors
that
finish
with
a
big
bitterness
and
while
this
is
all
good
and
tasty
im
left
feeling
full
with
this
beer
the
body
and
bitterness
overwhelm
me
to
a
degree
and
as
a
result
im
not
wanting
more
d
pretty
solid
brew
different
and
easy
to
drink

my

better
experience
still
too
bitter

i
was
able
to

this
is
still
a
good

is
fantastic
not

behind

if

at

love
to
have
access
to
this
beer
if
someone
told
me
that
i
could
only
drink
this

i
died
i
wouldnt

all

much
poors
a

really
cuts
through
nicely

round
im
rating
it

did
from

it
didnt

not
so
much

red
is
the
best

its
a
tour
de
force
of
flavor

bitterness
that
every
hophead
should
seek
out
highly
recommended
a
highly
drinkable
beer
for
hopheads
and
something
that
all
beer
lovers
should
at

try

hoppy
beers
at
green
flash
but
every
one
ive
had
so
far
has
been
delicious
the
hop
head
red
is
no
exception
d
easy
to
session
but
overall
not
going
to
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
in
the
style
to
grab
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
bought
as
a
single
for
2
50
at
andersons
in
columbus
the
beer
is
dark
copper
colored
with
a
thick
tan
lacing
foam
the
smell
is
mostly
hops
the
taste
is
ok
more
bitter
than
i
like
even
for
a
hopped
ale
not
enough
flavors
from
the
hops
just
the
bitterness
overall
ok
but
not
exceptional
nowhere
near
as
good
as
nugget
nectar
great
west
coast
beer
i
wish
this
were
easier
to
get
in
ga
we
will
probably
be
picking
up
much
more
of
this
and
other
green
flash
beers
on
our
winter
trip
to
ca
overall
impression
a
big
well
balanced
hoppy
amber
probably
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
glad
to
see
green
flash
in
oh
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
trusty
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
thick
amount
of
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
spicy
hops
with
plenty
of
that
very
specific
amarillo
hops
that
you
loveare
sick
of
a
lot
of
malty
aroma
is
powerful
as
well
taste
is
hoppy
with
some
strong
malt
very
creamy
mouth
feel
that
coats
my
tongue
i
would
drink
more
if
the
price
was
right
very
flavorful
and
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
may
reduce
drinkability
but
a
very
interesting
red
ale
umm
looks
kinda
red
with
the
tan
head
but
oh
my
god
is
this
hoppy
unlike
any
other
red
ale
you
will
ever
taste
big
ass
hop
nose
and
a
big
ass
hop
taste
a
dryness
to
the
finish
and
a
lack
of
big
malt
backbone
make
this
a
hopheads
dream
even
hoppier
than
the
ipa
this
is
one
of
these
hop
beers
that
is
unexpected
pours
a
dark
cloudy
almost
ice
tea
color
big
frothy
beige
head
that
smells
of
hop
and
malt
yummy
i
let
the
head
disappear
before
drinking
and
it
left
big
sticky
lacing
all
around
i
let
warm
up
pretty
good
before
drinking
if
its
going
to
taste
anything
like
it
smells
and
looks
i
want
to
taste
it
big
hop
up
front
with
some
oily
pine
bitter
finish
wow
big
floral
hop
with
citrus
and
malt
super
good
warmer
makes
this
a
sipper
i
dont
want
this
to
end
i
think
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
get
it
d
tasty
even
with
a
bit
of
off
flavors
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
sessioning
this
appears
a
deep
caramel
amber
hue
with
a
large
off
white
head
foating
above
the
body
at
least
two
fingers
worth
of
head
develop
with
lacing
left
behind
evenly
in
thick
bands
aromatics

a
huge
grapefruit
mix
with
pine
accents
from
the
raw
west
coats
hops
a
sweet
caramel
and
brown

exists
as
well
the
flavors
comes
off
earthy
herbal
and
citrus
peels
with
pine
accents
a
healhty
amount
of
flowing
bitterness
with
just
enough
minimal
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
hop
oils
streaking
across
the
palate
and
an
even
natural
carbonation
level
to
boot
drinkability
is
hoppy
in
your
face
red
ale
that
ive
enjoyed
both
from
the
bottle
and
tap
with
some
finnesse
to
deliver
across
my
palate
one
pretty
friggin
good
hop
bomb
available
to
me
thank
god
de
vinos116
pack
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
the
malt
sure
does
try
to
balance
the
situation
d
the
best
comment
that
i
can
make
about
the
drinkability
goes
back
to
a
night
at
beachwood
i
sat
by
the
wait
station
and
every
thrid
beer
that
they
poured
out
of
21
taps
was
a
hop
head
red
cheers
d
drinks
alright
but
its
hops
and
little
else
would
be
a
lot
better
if
the
flavor
lasted
longer
and
had
some
fruity
aspects
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
big
grapefruity
hops
with
a
small
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
mainly
a
sweet
malt
and
kind
of
sticky
a
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
grapefruity
hop
aftertaste
smells
like
an
ipa
drinks
like
a
red
ale
nice
and
good
i
think
getting
a
good
beer
from
the
tap
is
better
than
any
other
serving
type
and
so
it
goes
that
i
would
love
this
want
to
try
it
in
bottle
before
i
annoint
it
fully
as
my
new
favorite
but
if
you
find
this
gem
but
it
drink
it
and
brag
to
your
friends
d
nothing
stopping
you
from
having
a
few
of
these
unless
you
wanna
give
your
tastes
buds
a
break
great
hoppy
red
ale
could
pass
as
an
ipa
its
a
great
beer
and
certainly
a
hop

pours
typical
darker
amber
medium
tan
head
and
spotty
lace
nice
whiff
of
fruity
hops
in
the
nose
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
amberred
ale
sort
of
boring
compared
to
the
dipas
i
crave
but
this
one
obviously
kicks
up
the
hops
and
doesnt
disappoint
dry
hopping
adds
the
desirable
hop
fruitiness
and
bitterness
notes
of
pineapple
hops
darker
malts
and
overall
beery
goodness
fine
high
class
and
tasty
brew
from
sds
gf
d
this
is
a
big
bold
hop
monster
of
a
brew
from
green
flash
with
tons
of
flavor
packed
in
glad
to
have
tried
this
on
tap
d
a
really
great
beer
and
a
good
showcase
of
hops
with
balancing
malt
a
bit
of
an
intense
experience
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
at
a
time
mouthfeel
is
of
heavy
grapefruit
with
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
spritzy
bitter
yet
balanced
brew
i
had
listened
to
allot
of
hype
surrounding
this
beer
so
i
was
prepared
to
be
let
down
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
actually
better
than
expected
this
is
a
truly
delicious
brew
that
despite
the
copious
amounts
of
hops
is
really
very
balanced
it
has
a
very
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
just
enough
malt
to
balance
the
hop
profile
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweeter
malty
red
or
american
amber
then
this
will
probably
be
too
hoppy
but
as
the
label
indicates
if
you
are
interested
in
a
variation
on
an
ipa
then
it
will
not
disappoint
its
rare
for
me
to
drink
the
same
beer
back
to
back
as
i
have
a
case
of
beer
drinking
add
but
as
soon
as
i
finished
my
first
hop
head
red
i
was
reaching
for
a
second
pours
a
reddish
amberbrown
with
a
fairly
thick
pancake
head
that
settles
to
a
cap
eventually
some
decent
lacing
as
well
the
bottle
says
6
and
amarillo
dryhopped
smells
very
well
integrated
with
caramel
malt
and
spicy
hops
with
a
touch
of
cinammon
nice
quite
a
bit
more
hops
in
the
taste
immediately
there
are
earthy
piney
spicy
hops
with
lingering
bitterness
the
malt
definitely
plays
second
fiddle
here
on
the
finish
there
is
a
bit
more
of
the
red
character
from
the
malt
there
is
a
creamy
smoothness
that
rounds
the
dges
a
bit
that
you
sometimes
get
with
some
of
the
better
reds
it
is
definitely
here
quite
enjoyable
especially
for
a
red
and
the
amazing
thing
is
that
the
abv
is
kept
well
in
check
for
all
the
flavor
here
kudos
for
a
proven
very
capable
san
diego
brewery
to
release
a
dry
hopped
beer
named
hop
head
it
wouldnt
have
been
unreasonable
to
ask
for
more
hops
yes
the
beer
is
hoppy
but
both
smell
and
taste
left
a
fair
bit
to
be
desired
i
didnt
take
it
to
be
quite
red
ale
nor
quite
an
ipa
and
although
quite
good
it
didnt
really
have
enough
of
the
character
of
either
style
to
really
work
for
me
that
being
said
it
is
yet
another
solid
offering
from
green
flash
well
balanced
and
drinkable
though
id
stop
short
of
calling
it
sessionable
drinkability
i
only
got
one
bottle
but
id
easily
get
a
sixpack
in
the
future
green
flash
continues
to
kick
ass
and
brew
some
truly
west
coast
beers
drinkability
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
in
my
opinion
from
the
sweetness
and
overall
massiveness
of
this
brew
pretty
decent
overall
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
poured
into
a
nonic
dark
copper
but
not
too
dark
to
see
that
its
perfectly
clear
light
tan
head
leaves
ample
lacing
aroma
is
on
the
hoppy
side
with
a
rather
herbal
quality
coming
through
more
so
than
the
typical
grapefruit
flavor
is
similar
lots
of
dry
leafy
hops
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
only
a
bare
minimum
malt
profile
lack
of
malt
makes
this
beer
thinnish
green
flash
has
done
it
again
and
in
style
my
favorite
green
flash
beer
so
far
and
one
ill
be
looking
for
in
the
future
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
a
ton
of
resinous
citrus
and
piney
hops
tons
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
amazing
i
have
had
very
few
beers
as
smooth
extremely
well
balanced
with
a
good
malt
backbone
supporting
a
delicious
hop
profile
overall
green
flash
hop
head
red
ale
is
a
delicious
beer
that
is
highly
recommended
i
love
this
beer
but
it
certainly
isnt
for
everyone
a
slick
creamy
start
to
the
mouthfeel
followed
by
a
rough
twinge
almost
metallic
dryness
to
the
finish
im
not
an
overall
fan
of
this
one
but
it
is
interesting
enough
to
try
again
and
i
do
recommend
to
others
for
at
least
one
try
i
can
see
how
the
bitterness
could
begin
to
wear
on
me
if
i
were
to
session
this
which
brings
down
the
drinkability
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
red
ipa
an
apt
description
in
my
opinion
cheers
the
second
bottle
is
a
bit
lighter
due
to
the
recognition
of
flavor
combination
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
really
cold
too
overall
a
big
hoppy
amber
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
draught
at
falling
rock
very
dark
red
color
with
ample
foam
big
time
hop
nose
impressive
smelling
hints
of
grapefruit
and
big
time
resin
basically
it
smelled
like
a
big
sack
of
hops
flavor
is
big
on
resinous
hops
and
packs
a
punch
nicely
hopped
but
also
a
nice
malt
backing
as
well
this
was
a
very
nice
red
ale
overall
as
the
label
says
its
definitely
a
red
ipa
so
if
youre
looking
for
a
standard
red
ale
look
elsewhere
if
however
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
packs
a
punch
with
the
hops
look
no
further
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
on
cask
at
taproom
in
pb
came
out
almost
like
it
was
on
nitro
with
a
cascading
bubble
appearance
and
tight
frothy
head
that
wouldnt
disappear
nice
aroma
packed
full
of
hops
can
definitely
tell
the
difference
that
this
one
is
dry
hopped
with
about
a
half
pound
of
amarillo
or
something
tasted
like
the
same
hop
head
red
im
used
to
but
packed
full
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
nice
maltiness
that
balances
it
out
just
right
luscious
mouthfeel
from
the
cask
conditioning
and
this
thing
is
so
drinkable
i
couldnt
take
it
away
from
my
face
i
had
two
of
them
and
i
usually
never
get
the
same
beer
twice
at
a
bar
feel
and
drinkability
were
above
average
surely
part
of
this
is
due
to
the
firkin
factor
ill
try
again
on
co2
soon
d
an
unusual
representation
of
the
style
thats
a
nice
change
from
a
usual
weak
red
ale
but
i
prefer
something
from
in
the
troegs
style
a
little
more
for
drinkability
where
hops
are
understated
and
complex
rather
than
hammering
your
palate
overall
a
one
dimensional
brew
for
the
hop
lovers
i
prefer
a
little
more
balance
and
the
brighter
hops
doas
i
mentioned
earlier
the
fact
that
this
beer
leans
so
heavily
on
the
bittering
hops
may
be
great
for
some
but
id
prefer
a
bit
more
balance
especially
after
all
the
great
floral
and
citrus
i
detected
in
the
smell
i
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
would
probably
switch
it
up
after
that
a
nice
hoppy
big
red
from
green
flash
i
bet
this
tastes
even
better
on
a
cask
engine
on
tap
at
the
pb
tap
room
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
but
the
best
was
at
pb
tap
room
juicy
hop
aroma
with
some
grapefruit
the
dry
hopped
amarillo
works
great
in
this
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
bitter
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
to
back
it
up
good
stuff
good
body
and
carbonation
easy
to
drink
pretty
balanced
solid
i
wouldnt
really
consider
this
a
red
ale
at
all
to
me
i
tastes
just
like
another
typical
ipa
decent
balance
of
flavors
but
it
definitely
doesnt
stay
true
to
the
style
of
beer
notes
good
brewgood
hops
and
i
look
forward
to
having
some
more
as
i
love
the
style
and
felt
the

were
just

very

nice
to
see
this
in
6packshad
it
at
the
brewery
last
year
and
i
am
very
happy
tp
find
at
my
local
beer
store
this
is
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
fades
but
doesnt
completely
disappear
the
little
bursting
bubbles
give
off
a
nice
piney
citrus
aroma
leading
into
the
taste
which
is
also
quite
quite
hoppy
but
with
a
nice
toasted
caramel
maltiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
well
balanced
in
fact
i
think
ill
shut
up
and
drink
a
good
brew
but
id
have
to
agree
with
rblwthcoz
that
it
is
a
bit
tight
and
lacks
complexity
flavor
is
earthy
as
well
very
leaf
and
soil
like
robust
and
deep
its
a
bit
more
open
than
when
i
had
it
ontap
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
too
tight
then
and
this
is
a
bit
looser
but
its
still
a
bit
uptight
call
it
curt
if
you
will
feel
has
a
good
liquid
body
and
the
carbonation
is
decent
enough
a
robust
hoppy
red
nice
to
drink
but
not
really
bringing
any
mass
of
complexity
pour
a
dark
red
hued
tea
color
with
a
big
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
nice
sheets
of
lacing
visibly
effervescent
tiny
pools
of
bubbles
scatter
about
the
surface
the
smell
is
aggressive
fragrant
and
piny
over
a
fundamentally
earthy
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
bright
and
medium
bodied
full
flavored
piny
resin
and
caramel
malt
taste
lingers
really
well
the
dry
hopped
nature
is
vibrant
and
it
dominates
the
caramel
malt
beneath
i
appreciate
the
suggestion
that
its
a
red
ipa
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
the
6
abv
is
very
sessionable
this
one
has
potentially
significant
recreational
opportunity
a
lot
to
this
one
highly
recommended
d
fairly
easy
but
the
high
bitterness
and
slimy
feel
hurts
this
one
d
fine
fine
red
w
plenty
of
hoppiness
deserving
of
the
name
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
top
notch
red
ale
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
grab
it
if
i
see
again
overall
a
very
fine
brew
big
enough
that
the
hopheads
will
love
it
and
balanced
enough
for
everyone
else
flavor
is
rich
and
full
with
an
excellent
mouthfeel
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
tan
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
red
brew
head
falls
everso
slowly
with
sporadic
chunky
lacing
aroma
is
pretty
much
totally
neutral
for
me
taste
is
follows
along
with
the
nose
but
doesnt
overdo
it
everything
flows
together
nicely
no
evidence
to
me
that
were
playing
7
6abv
ball
here
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
drinkability
is
great
for
a
brew
that
touts
itself
as
being
hoppy
those
usually
seem
to
overachieve
will
find
this
one
again
d
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
session
beer
i
think
tho
i
had
my
expectations
set
too
high
none
the
less
this
is
a
really
great
beer
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
hue
with
particles
floating
in
here
and
there
the
thick
one
fingered
light
khaki
colored
head
slowly
dies
down
to
a
rocky
layer
of
bubbles
stickiness
is
insanely
good
lots
of
webbing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
initial
smell
is
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malts
with
a
slightly
metallic
undertone
grassy
with
a
hint
of
pine
in
the
nose
as
well
a
creamy
honey
scent
blends
in
well
with
this
one
the
sweet
malts
begin
on
the
tongue
but
are
quickly
dominated
by
the
hop
character
a
good
amount
of
pine
and
earthy
hops
midway
that
lead
to
a
pretty
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
damn
this
is
an
red
ale
slick
medium
body
with
a
full
creamy
feel
and
a
stinging
carbonation
a
good
beer
but
i
like
the
style
more
on
the
malty
side
this
is
clearly
a
west
coast
version
of
the
amberred
ale
this
could
easily
pass
as
an
east
coast
ipa
whoa
hops

flavors

linger
on
the
tongue
with
an
underlinging

hops
are
pretty
evident
but
not
overpowering
the

is
pretty
long

taste
was
a
bad
mix
of
hops
and
malts
just
didnt
taste
right
to
me
finish
left
a
bad
taste
i
expected
a
lot
better
looks
like
im
in
the
minority
though
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic

glass
the
beer
pours
a
brownruby
red
color
with
about
an
inch
beige
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
very
good
the
aroma
is
citrusygrassy
hops
bread
and
caramel
malt
it
smells
nice
but
the
aroma
isnt
very
strong
luckily
the
flavor
is
much
stronger
than
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
it
smells
and
theres
a
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
good
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
too
the
aftertaste
does
linger
around
a
while
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
rich
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
too
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
put
away
a
few
of
these
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
ill
have
to
buy
it
again
the
next
time
i
find
it
hoping
green
flash
makes
it
to
ri
soon
ontap
at
zenos
in
state
college
now
smokefree
this
beer
is
all
around
good
representation
of
the
style
nothing
really
stands
out
in
my
mind
about
this
beer
in
both
a
positive
and
a
negative
way
i
left
the
bar
thinking
it
was
a
decent
drinkable
beer
maybe
not
as
hoppy
as
the
name
would
imply
but
as
im
walking
down
the
street
the
citrus
bitterness
was
just
never
ending
maybe
it
was
just
because
i
became
aware
of
it
but
it
felt
like
the
bitterness
was
growing
instead
of
fading
20
minutes
later
i
still
had
a
wonderful
flavor
in
my
mouth
loved
it
its
worth
a
try
i
think
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
cloudy
amberbrown
with
floaters
not
sure
if
its
suppose
to
have
that
with
2
cm
foamy
off
white
head
aroma
of
rye
and
some
hops
initial
flavors
fruit
and
rye
flavor
ends
more
hoppy
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
metalic
lots
of
lacing
some
carbonation
light
body
and
couldnt
appreciate
the
alcohol
presence
overall
kinda
disappointing
but
still
a
solid
rye
too
much
build
up
this
is
a
nice
one
to
try
but
be
sure
to
try
the
west
coast
first
hoppy
as
hell
with
a
bitter
lingering
aftertaste
lots
of
grass
pine
and
citrus
theres
a
big
malt
body
behind
it
all
but
its
not
really
a
fantastic
brew
damn
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
its
just
average
nice
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
roasted
and
bisquit
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
its
dry
with
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
roasted
and
bisquit
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
toastey
and
finishes
with
an
excellent
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
hoppy
red
ales
are
really
flooding
the
market
lately
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
recommended
finish
has
grapefruit
bitterness
and
is
somewhat
dry
another
fine
offering
from
green

poured
from
bottle
to
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
nice
redauburn
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
with
an
aggressive
pour
first
aroma
is
of
swet
caramel
or
malt
then
some
nice
citrusy
hops
good
full
flavvor
with
some
malt
smoothness
but
ending
with
a
bitter
hop
bite
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
with
hints
of
alcohol
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
great
effort
on
a
hoppy
red
ale
by
green
flash
d
a
nice
hop
fix
that
goes
down
easy
i
could
get
my
hop
fix
off
this
brew
in
the
current
summer
heat
or
in
cooler
temps
d
quaffable
definately
nice
dark
amber
to
garnet
appearance
a
bubbly
head
gives
way
to
a
nice
thick
fluffy
sheet
of
lace
that
goes
the
distance
with
multiple
rings
of
cling
sweet
juicy
citrus
tangerine
and
red
ruby
grapefruit
nose
classic
amarillo
goodness
some
sweet
carmel
malts
blend
with
a
slight
tobacco
note
as
well
rich
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
blend
with
nice
array
of
citrus
hop
flavors
the
finish
has
a
nice
lingering
but
not
overbearing
bitterness
as
well
as
a
slightly
sweet
berry
like
flavor
this
is
an
ultra
rich
and
hoppy
red
ale
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
drinks
very
easy
just
about
sessionable
at
6
yeah
this
is
a
hoppy
red
ale
but
who
the
hell
cares
great
stuff
well
rounded
and
entertainingly
hoppy
d
i
could
have
another
but
i
would
rather
have
something
else
interesting
i
guess
we
need
more
hoppy
reds
out
there
overall
hop
head
red
hit
the
spot
for
me
and
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
brew
i
would
love
to
do
a
sidebyside
with
nugget
nectar
to
compare
i
believe
hop
head
would
stand
its
own
highly
recommended
dability
the
beer
is
called
hop
head
if
you
are
one
youll
find
it
very
drinkable
particularly
if
you
like
amarillo
hops
ultimately
the
hops
were
a
bit
much
for
me
in
this
beer
wow
i
think
a
found
a
new
session
beer
even
at
6
this
was
just
fantastic
with
full
rich
flavors
including
great
hop
bitterness
and
was
drinkable
as
heck
i
drank
this
so
fast
that
i
was
almost
done
with
it
before
i
realized
that
i
hadnt
even
reviewed
the
body
yet
very
nicely
done
green
flash
and
thanks
for
bottling
this
great
stuff
0708
after
having
this
on
tap
i
have
to
bump
the
smell
score
nice
d
an
interesting
beer
from
green
flash
an
ira
definitely
worth
a
shot
but
i
much
prefer
their
regular
ipa
body
is
medium
creamy
oily
and
mouthcoating
with
a
penetrating
hop
finish
very
drinkable
and
worth
seeking
for
my
money
id
invest
in
the
green
flash
west
coast
ipa
before
this
beer
but
hop
head
red
is
an
interesting
twist
on
an
amber
ale
and
well
worth
trying
poured
a
very
clouded
amber
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
head
smell
is
rather
mild
which
is
a
bit
surprising
when
you
get
the
first
sip
which
attacks
you
with
dry
hops
you
would
expect
something
this
highly
hopped
to
have
more
of
an
aroma
odd
there
isnt
much
to
this
beer
other
than
hops
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
get
your
hop
fix
on
but
nothing
extraordinary
kind
of
a
bit
raw
tasting
mouthfeel
is
decent
enough
medium
body
medium
carbonation
pours
dark
amber
with
a
thin
head
nice
lacing
big
hop
smell
which
is
borderline
ipa
taste
is
very
hoppy
but
has
the
amber
ale
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
it
has
a
good
bite
to
it
cheers
to
a
fine
brew
from
green
flash
d
crazy
good
could
this
be
better
than
nugget
nectar
or
reds
rye
i
would
love
to
have
a
side
by
side
showdown
i
love
you
hh
red
overall
a
very
pleasant
experience
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
i
plan
to
pick
this
up
in
bottles
definitely
plural
this
is
worth
having
on
hand
to
share
to
see
how
the
taste
compares
drinkability
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
but
was
satisfied
with
the
outcome
a
bit
more
balanced
would
have
made
this
a
much
better
if
not
outstanding
beer
needs
some
more
sweetness
this
beer
goes
down
easy
medium
bodied
and
a
pleasant
suprise
they
didnt
go
for
too
much
just
an
overall
good
beer
hop
head
red
is
a
standup

that
hopheads
should
try
out

this
is
very
drinkable
purchased

great
stuff
definitely
recommended
d
one
pint
is
enough
my
tastebuds
may
never
recover
i
have
always
been
a
hophead
but
this
one
may
be
too
liberal
for
me
green

thank
you
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
aroma
is
deep
pine
hops
and
burnt
caramel
in
a
nice
balance
the
taste
is
bitter
pine
hops
followed
by
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
that
lingers
as
a
nice
balance
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
low
carbonation
just
a
little
bit
on
the
bitter
side
while
not
the
best
hoppy
amber
ale
ive
had
its
the
best
and
im
pretty
sure
the
only
one
ive
seen
here
in
nc
i
think
its
best
to
let
this
one
warm
up
just
a
little
to
avoid
the
green
dryhop
flavors
and
bring
out
the
malts
tasty
mouthfeel
is
good
easy
to
drink
but
that
herbal
bitterness
would
prevent
this
one
from
being
a
session
beer
for
me
the
taste
was
good
but
a
bit
too
bitter
for
the
style
sweet
caramel
malts
hit
first
but
were
soon
overpowered
by
a
pungently
bitter
hoppiness
as
i
said
i
love
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
probably
fits
the
ipa
category
a
little
better
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
as
per
the
style
smooth
slightly
sticky
and
left
a
whopping
resinous
pine
note
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
though
i
liked
this
beer
green
flash
certainly
lives
up
to
its
westcoast
hop
bomb
credentials
although
i
wouldve
liked
to
have
seen
them
tone
down
the
hops
or
turn
up
the
malts
a
bit
in
this
one
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
harsh
although
some
might
like
this
it
needs
a
bit
more
balance
to
improve
drinkablility
worth
a
try
another
winner
from
this
brewery
all
in
all
a
slight
miss
in
my
opinion
i
like
hops
as
much
as
the
next
hophead
but
this
style
which
is
becoming
more
and
more
prevalent
thus
leading
to
better
examples
than
this
needs
a
strong
malt
showing
to
really
be
great
poured

absolutely
a
hop
heads
dream
massive

floral

probably
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beverage
malt
backed
coppery

with
massive
amounts
of
hops
very
well
balanced
nice
dry

this
is
a
very
nice
beer
green
flash
brews
some
terrific
beers
and
this
is
a
good
component
of
their
portfolio
you
should
definitely
grab
a
pint
if
you
find
it
in
cask
on
tap
at
stone
for
the
san
diego
storm
dark
cherry
color
with
a
foamy
and
rocky
light
tan
head
the
smell
was
so
unique
that
ive
never
experienced
it
before
it
was
the
smell
of
hop
pellets
straight
from
the
homebrew
store
very
dank
and
volatile
the
taste
was
malty
maybe
more
toasty
toward
the
end
of
the
sip
and
quite
a
bit
citrusy
and
resiny
an
interesting
beer
overall
a
bit
much
for
me
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
the
glass
was
pleasant
this
is
a
very
good
red
ale
i
dont
really
see
how
its
all
that
different
from
an
ipa
but
i
dont
really
care
either
its
good
and
anyone
who
likes
hops
should
give
it
a
try
recommended
the
beer

dark

with
small
chunks
of
amarillo
hops

to
dry

im
assuming
with
a
thick
tan
head
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
an
intensely
resinouspiney
aroma
of
hops
awesome
the
initial
taste
was
of
sweet
malt
but
shortlived
as
the
resinous
hop
flavor
took
over
followed
by
a
clean
crisp
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
great
ipa
and
another
success
by

you
would
expect
as
well
as
a
decent

as
if
it
was
blended
with
a
hoppy
pale
ale
but
the
hops
dont
overwhelmthe
blend
of
flavors
is
right
on
the
money
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
quite
a
likeable
ale
but
it
is
strong
hoppy
stuff
and
completely
unsuited
to
lager

if
you

you
will
love
this

for

a
decent
beer
for
the
most
part
if
this
is
strictly

its
good
to
see
them

body
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
easy
drink
and
perfect
for
the
time
of
year
another
top
notch
brew
from
green
flash
it
might
not
please
someone
who
is
expecting
a
super
hop
bomb
that
will
knock
them
on
their
ass
but
it
should
very
well
please
anyone
hoping
to
enjoy
a
few
nice
well
balanced
beers
that
contain
a
few
subtle
nuances
dark
amber
reddishbrown
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
aromas
of
pine
bark
cedar
toasty
caramel
malt
and
brown
rice
syrup
pleasant
balance
of
woodsy
coniferous
flavor
with
the
caramel
malt
this
has
a
sort
of
pacific
northwest
esb
kinda
thing
going
on
great
with
a
crisp
spring
or
fall
day
and
a
flannel
shirt
some
hopheads
might
wish
this
had
more
ibus
only
45
but
i
think
that
any
more
would
upset
the
balance
even
though
say
60
ibus
might
be
more
to
some
peoples
liking
for
a
6
alc
beer
mediumtofull
body
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
on
top
of
the
caramel
malt
this
beer
grows
on
you
but
only
if
you
let
go
of
any
hopes
ideas
or
preconceived
notions
of
a
hop
orgy
and
just
tune
in
to
whats
actually
going
on
in
your
glass
i
always
look
forward
to
a
good
hoppy
amberred
ale
and
green
flash
is
the
shiznit
so
i
really
was
happy
to
pick
up
a
few
of
these
bottles
yesterday
here
in
greensboro
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
deep
bronze
borderline
amber
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
two
finger
slight
off
white
head
that
never
totally
settleddeep
chocolate
notes
in
the
nose
with
a
some
herbal
hop
but
the
malt
to
me
is
stronger
than
the
hop
presence
i
love
the
amarillo
hop
and
this
was
dry
hopped
with
it
but
in
all
honesty
it
doesnt
play
a
huge
impact
flavor
wise
at
least
in
my
mindits
deeply
chocolaty
with
a
leafy
herbal
hop
presence
finish
dry
and
prety
earthy
its
a
decent
brew
but
maybe
a
bit
underwhelming
d
a
nice
combination
of
bitter
and
sweet
notes
a
worthy
brew
this
is
another
good
green
flash
offering
i
could
drink
them
all
night
very
nice
example
of
style
a
la
st
rogue
enjoyable
and
quaffable
enough
edit
first
attempt
of
this
from
the
bottle
and
it
was
quite
delicious
not
really
similar
to
nugget
nectar
as
i
tried
to
compare
but
both
are
super
in
their
own
right
could
drink
a
fair
share
of
this
brew
d
wow
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
reds
definitely
more
hoppy
than
most
other
red
ales
it
is
still
quite
balanced
and
the
abv
i
am
guessing
around
5
is
wellmasked
i
think
you
can
only
get
this
on
draftgrowler
so
hopefully
green
flash
will
bottle
this
in
the
near
future
so
everyone
can
enjoy
this
big
bold
hoppy
red
ale
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
strikes
a
good
balance
for
an
american
red
ale
d
sessionable
solid
flavor
good
balancve
enjoyable
good
red
unique
to
see
one
so
balanced
as
opposed
to
hoppy
id
have
another
pours
a
mahoganyred
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
head
smell
is
rather
mild
which
is
a
bit
surprising
when
you
get
the
first
sip
which
attacks
you
with
piney
hops
you
would
expect
something
this
highly
hopped
to
have
more
of
an
aroma
odd
there
isnt
much
to
this
beer
other
than
hops
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
get
your
hop
fix
on
but
nothing
extraordinary
kind
of
a
bit
raw
tasting
mouthfeel
is
decent
enough
medium
body
medium
carbonation
i
could
probably
not
drink
too
many
of
these
due
to
the
raw
quality
and
lack
of
any
notion
of
balance
this
is
a
great
beer
to
ease
into
a
darker
beer
the
light
amber
nodes
give
the
beer
a
toffee
and
caramel
taste
i
love
this
beer
with
a
nice
piece
of
steak
with
sauteed
mushrooms
highly
recommend
this
beer
then
ease
into
bells
two
hearted
very
smooth
beer
and
food
for
beer
beginner
smooth
with
a
good
level
of
bitterness
and
some
toffee
hints
i
liked
it
overall
very
smooth
a
bit
of
toffee
or
coffee
flavors
making
it
bitter
but
the
caramel
undertones
make
it
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
but
i
did
not
enjoy
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
it
was
rather
overpowering
have
not
seen
the
bottle
pictured
with
stork
type
bird
but
instead
image
is
various
natural
scenes
dunes
evergreen
trees
freshwater
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
good
amber
sweet
taste
with
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
really
like
bells
brown
but
the
amber
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste
i
need
five
words
to
too
much
like
an
ipa
for
my
taste
serving
type
bottle
o
very
impressed
with
the
drinkability
its
balanced
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
middle
slight
hoppy
aromas
and
flavors
this
makes
me
want
to
revisit
some
amber
ales
as
i
has
been
awhile
since
ive
had
one
i
could
see
this
beer
fitting
in
where
i
might
not
want
an
ipa
or
a
pale
ale
id
reach
for
this
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
draft
at
the
refinery
in
newhall
ca
22814
i
love
the
new
packaging
on
this
beer
a
landscape
in
watercolor
just
beautiful
and
unassuming
the
beer
in
the
bottle
is
killer
too
one
of
the
better
ambers
out
there
really
its
not
sweet
at
all
but
has
all
the
rich
froth
of
a
good
one
caramel
malt
and
probably
some
oats
in
here
too
mildly
tannic
really
fluffy
feeling
and
remarkably
dry
for
the
style
the
yeast
is
tough
to
place
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
irish
strain
but
it
could
be
done
really
cold
if
its
an
american
ale
strain
its
pretty
darn
flavorful
still
which
i
think
suits
the
style
really
well
i
like
a
yeasty
amber
the
beer
is
clear
and
clean
too
though
for
having
so
much
flavor
and
even
brings
some
earthy
dried
bittering
hops
to
the
table
a
pleasant
way
to
finish
up
a
beer
thats
not
overly
complex
but
extremely
drinkable
a
six
pack
is
the
right
dose
of
this
and
its
one
of
the
better
basic
beers
bells
does
i
had
it
in
a
bottle
but
would
love
to
get
my
lips
on
some
draft
this
keep
my
faith
in
bells
enormously
high
great
beer
but
not
my
favorite
amber
very
complex
flavor
bouquet
with
cocoa
coffee
and
hints
of
a
smokeyness
to
it
mild
bitterness
comes
in
early
in
aftertaste
but
mellowed
quickly
aroma
doesnt
appeal
as
much
as
taste
does
overall
would
buy
again
just
not
quite
my
favorite
this
red
amber
ale
is
decent
ive
had
better
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
only
was
able
to
find
one
but
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
a
few
of
nice
balance
lots
of
bread
crust
type
flavor
clean
and
very
drinkable
ksticky
heavy
brown
honestly
doesnt
do
much
for
me
missing
the
wow
factor
o
good
beer
wellbalanced
and
refreshing
wow
a
truly
exceptional
beer
color
and
taste
are
by
far
the
most
appealing
parts
of
the
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
more
flavor
and
better
mouthfeel
of
any
amber
ale
out
there
love
it
the
young
microbrewery
fans
out
there
have
no
idea
about
the
legacy
that
this
beer
is
it
was
one
of
the
first
micro
brewed
beers
ever
and
helped
start
the
whole
revolution
thanks
larry
bell

knocking
down
the
door
of
boring
american
lagers

introducing
us
to
this
great

youd
be

hello
my
name
is
amber
makes
for
a
great
anytime
beer
not
bad
but
not
very
memorable
ill
file
this
under
my
things
to
order
when
im
out
of
ideas
list
o
a
good
drinking
beer
nothing
outstanding
like
their
oberon
just
a
nice
beer
to
have
sitting
around
on
the
deck
bet
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
win
over
budcoors
drinkers
this
is
good
and
that
coming
from
a
guy
not
generally
into
amber
ales
it
has
a
great
spicy
herbal
and
buttery
bread
malt
character
refreshing
yet
oily
from
the
hops
a
whole
lot
of
orange
juice
in
the
nose
maybe
some
cloves
theres
a
little
veggie
like
fresh
green
herbal
notes
in
both
nose
and
taste
alcohol
is
not
very
noticeable
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
really
nice
drinking
o
a
very
approachable
ale
tastes
like
a
light
malty
pale
ale
without
much
citrus
i
would
buy
this
again
as
an
easydrinking
ale
for
sure
od
while
this
is
a
good
amber
its
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
especially
given
the
reputation
of
the
brewery
a
decent
kick
at
the
can
but
lacking
in
depth
and
hop
character
for
sure
not
worth
seeking
out
medium
body
and
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
rich
layered
and
creamy
with
a
cascading
buttery
finish
overall
good
amber
ale
overall
but
it
could
be
a
great
one
if
the
flavors
were
amped
up
a
bit
i
feel
like
i
need
to
take
a
gulp
to
really
taste
it
which
i
do
any
ways
because
it
is
so
smooth

to

the

fan
i

you
should
give
it
a

to
decide
for
yourself
not
until
returning
to
my
humid
existence
in
rainy
err
sunny
florida
did
i
try
bells
original
beer
the
amber
ale
wow
this
is
an
excellent
beer
hoppy
sweet
and
bitter
with
unfiltered
sediment
in
the
pour
a
tall
yet
light
head
at
pour
yet
not
too
heavy
for
the
florida
heat
i
love
this
stuff
o
my
first
experience
with
bells
amber
was
a
good
one
nice
tasty
and
well
balanced
beer
will
not
put
off
anyone
except
maybe
those
freaked
out
by
cloudy
appearance
not
a
favorite
but
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
beer
is
special
to
be
as
it
is
the
first
craft
beer
i
was
exposed
to
when
i
was
a
kid
and
saw
adults
drinking
things
that
werent
bmc
products
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
a
nice
sessionable
malty
beer
and
i
also
enjoy
the
history
of
this
beer
as
it
was
larry
bells
flagship
offering
back
in
1985
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
decent
head
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
a
touch
of
yeast
this
ale
is
slightly
bitter
in
a
good
way
and
has
a
nice
balance
that
is
not
too
heavy
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
another
winner
from
this
brewery
overall
this
is
a
masterfully
crafted
brew
this
is
the
first
ive
had
from
bells
and
ill
be
going
back
for
more
adam
from
tipped
mixology
overall
this
beer
is
very
food
friendly
it
would
go
great
with
some
nice
red
meat
it
was
a
little
darker
in
color
then
i
typically
would
prefer
the
smell
was
very
good
smelled
of
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
citrus
similar
to
oberon
the
overall
taste
was
very
good
although
the
alcohol
content
was
a
little
higher
it
was
very
smooth
and
crisp
overall
very
good
this
is
a
very
good
amber
style
beer
with
great
flavor
to
me
an
amber
ale
is
a
very
basic
beer
that
is
just
well
balance
with
an
all
around
good
flavor
and
this
embodies
that
i
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
in
the
fall
when
is
starts
to
get
a
little
colder
outside
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
well
made
amber
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
i
could
probably
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
would
choose
it
over
other
sessionable
beers
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
pick
up
a
six
pack
next
time
around
for
what
you
get
though
i
felt
overpriced
not
on
any
lees
says
unpasturized
but
mine
pours
very
clear
a
tamed
yet
flavorful
amber
has
a
feel
of
a
pale
ale
but
a
nice
honey
malt
undertone
theres
a
bit
of
a
celerytype
taste
a
dark
fruit
hint
grape
its
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
easy
going
feel
to
it
nothing
strong
about
it
a
mild
honey
and
hoppy
scent
a
lovely
caramel
brown
color
hazy
with
tons
of
sediment
o
i
should
never
be
surprised
by
bells
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
try
again
not
an
amber
by
todays
standards
far
less
american
hop
character
than
weve
come
to
expect
the
malt
is
nice
though
wish
i
liked
this
more
o
fantastic
unique
amber
ale
unique
in
that
it
has
a
ton
of
the
right
flavors
going
on
perhaps
crossing
into
a
few
style
categories
with
its
rich
maltiness
and
body
worth
a
try
ive
witnessed
some
casual
beer
drinkers
digging
this
a
lot
overall
the
weird
bitterness
is
too
unpleasant
to
consider
another
but
id
consider
resampling
on
tap
this
offering
pours
a
deep
burgundy
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
gives
way
to
a
nice
film
and
lacing
the
nose
is
subtle
but
pleasant
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
as
well
as
an
underlying
alcohol
note
it
sips
smooth
and
clean
with
a
light
to
medium
body
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
quite
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
you
could
sit
and
drink
a
number
of
and
enjoy
each
one
not
particularly
complex
or
remarkable
but
very
balanced
and
damn
good
might
have
again
if
i
had
access
a
safe
bet
for
a
solid
generally
enjoyable
brew
i
had
high
expectations
on
this
that
is
a
very
good
beer
but
far
from
blowing
my
mind
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
amber
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
i
was
more
impressed
by
bells
two
hearted
ipa
in
fact
was
blown
away
so
maybe
my
expectations
were
set
a
bit
high
i
thought
this
beer
could
have
been
more
complex
as
stated
still
an
ok
brew
o
really
good
beer
lighter
and
sharper
then
typical
amber
ales
but
i
can
dig
it
plus
at
5
8
its
rather
intoxicating
still
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
classic
amber
ale
id
have
to
look
elsewhere
my
overall
opinion
is
this
is
a
hit
or
miss
beer
something
about
the
ingredients
or
hopsmalts
balance
i
just
really
dislike
the
taste
of
others
may
really
like
the
way
it
tastes
so
ymmv
id
tell
you
to
get
the
fat
tire
instead
of
this
would
not
recommend
aroma
is
malts
fruit
and
tangerinetropical
fruit
the
flavor
is
fruittangerine
very
mild
hop
resin
malts
and
a
bitterslightly
tart
finish
overall
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
anything
special
but
its
a
very
well
done
ale
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
for
sure
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
earth
shattering
o
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
hadnt
had
this
in
a
while
but
it
reminds
me
of
how
a
lot
of
people
myself
included
treat
bells
oberon
in
the
summer
very
sessionable
not
in
terms
of
abv
but
balance
and
enjoyability
o
a
nice
easy
drinker
all
around
great
balanced
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
example
of
this
style
dont
know
why
it
took
me
a
michigander
so
long
to
discover
this
beer
although
i
dont
think
its
overly
prevalent
in
the
stores
and
bars
that
i
frequent
it
will
be
my
goto
beer
when
its
available
and
i
want
an
amber
ale
overall
not
much
too
this
one
but
that
doesnt
make
it
unenjoyable
its
light
and
sessionable
so
it
has
its
place
in
the
beer
drinking
world
spicy
hops
and
rigorous
toastiness
melds
in
with
rich
amber
malts
the
maltiness
is
pretty
dominant
yet
curt
on
byflavors
in
an
american
way
crispiness
from
the
hops
pulls
out
interesting
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
almost
cinnamon
or
clove
from
the
steeped
grains
hardly
noticeable
is
any
alcohol
hops
are
more
spicy
and
floral
than
anything
else
however
there
is
a
backdrop
of
citrus
pith
no
sweetness
from
the
hops
and
only
a
malty
sugar
sense
from
the
fermented
grain
remains
with
stillpersistent
dryness
fullerbodied
for
an
amber
ale
a
lot
went
into
this
beer
to
produce
a
fantastically
clean
refined
and
simple
beer
bells
amber
offers
a
solidbodied
drink
with
a
crisp
effervescent
mouthfeel
that
really
pulls
out
all
of
the
quality
ingredients
in
their
naked
simplicity
good
pours
a
hazed
amber
orange
cloudy
with
a
loose
head
of
foam
that
fell
fast
to
a
thin
ring
leaves
soapy
lace
to
fall
as
you
drink
nose
is
faint
if
i
dive
right
in
i
can
get
some
light
caramel
and
bread
and
the
faintest
hop
floral
taste
is
mild
the
grain
is
toasted
to
amber
perfection
and
has
a
nice
round
and
full
flavor
that
presents
a
natural
sweetness
but
the
caramel
is
almost
too
faint
to
be
observed
on
the
palate
it
tastes
like
whole
grain
bread
as
it
warms
it
starts
to
develop
a
hop
floral
that
is
a
bit
sweet
on
the
nose
and
in
the
drink
it
has
soda
like
carbonation
so
quite
strong
it
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bitter
but
mid
palate
its
just
bland
it
could
have
used
more
malt
depth
and
more
malt
sweetness
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thin
and
has
a
bit
of
slickness
to
it
finishes
semi
dry
with
an
aftertaste
of
flaked
cereal
grain
there
is
a
hint
of
citric
tartness
also
int
he
finish
but
it
seems
like
too
little
too
late
just
a
random
pick
up
in
a
choose
your
own
6pack
ive
had
a
few
other
amber
ales
that
werent
bad
but
nothing
id
join
a
site
just
to
review
and
remember
my
expectations
werent
too
high
which
made
it
all
the
better
it
looks
good
and
smells
great
but
thats
just
the
start
slightly
hoppy
slightly
bitter
slightly
smokey
great
feel
overall
it
has
all
the
elements
of
a
great
beer
and
theyre
in
harmony
unlike
other
beers
that
overkill
one
element
i
think
its
my
new
favorite
allseason
beer
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
amber
ale
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
very
tasty
solid
offering
id
certainly
get
it
again
i
am
drinking
the
last
one
now
i
slow
poured
it
into
a
mason
jar
and
let
it
sit
for
3
minutes
until
the
head
was
down
and
the
lacing
was
left
the
taste
and
the
temperature
were
perfect
this
is
a
fine
ale
overall
balance
is
key
with
this
one
is
smooth
and
something
anyone
could
enjoy
bottom
line
if
you
are
a
fan
of
amber
ales
go
out
and
find
this
definitely
worth
trying
o
3
75
its
alright
im
kind
of
disappointed
though
because
i
got
such
great
feedback
on
it
from
my
friends
back
home
in
michigan
its
an
amber
ale
for
sure
o
its
a
good
example
of
a
well
made
amber
easy
to
drink
and
might
be
a
fall
alternative
to
all
those
octoberfests
o
solid
amber
that
is
well
made
and
well
balanced
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
great
amber
that
will
be
gracing
my
fridge
for
years
to
come
overall
an
excellent
take
on
the
classic
american
amber
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
definitely
one
i
would
buy
again
for
a
change
of
pace
if
i
ran
across
it
on
the
shelves
of
my
local
bottle
shop
o
a
good
amber
ale
from
bells
that
will
always
be
a
solid
choice
o
pretty
average
im
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
so
a
well
made
amber
is
ok
by
me
nothing
great
here
but
nothing
bad
you
can
drink
without
thinking
about
it
its
been
a
minute
since
ive
had
this
beer
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
a
real
deal
classic
and
what
i
consider
the
staple
of
american
amber
ales
its
very
good
stuff
and
enjoyable
theres
nothing
flashy
or
in
your
face
with
bells
amber
just
a
down
right
good
tasting
ale
thats
really
stunning
to
look
at
theres
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
ill
continue
picking
this
up
throughout
every
year
like
i
have
for
the
multiple
years
thats
past
one
i
can
pick
up
and
know
exactly
what
im
getting
and
one
that
always
brings
a
smile
to
my
face
started
off
thining
it
was
meh
but
ive
somehow
made
it
through
the
whole
thing
guess
thats
what
its
supposed
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
it
is
what
it
is
and
nothing
more
there
howd
i
do
glass
pint
overall
this
is
a
great
breakfast
beer
its
light
and
it
goes
down
smooth
it
doesnt
feel
like
im
drinking
a
beer
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
for
its
style
i
dig
it
because
its
simple
overall
a
highly
drinkable
beer
from
bells
also
their
first
beer
i
think
as
well
probably
their
most
accessible
id
find
it
hard
for
someone
to
not
like
this
yet
it
doesnt
have
any
super
complex
flavor
profiles
to
make
it
super
interesting
but
thats
what
their
goal
was
make
a
great
well
balanced
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
in
almost
situation
i
wouldnt
say
seek
it
out
but
its
widely
available
and
cheap
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
perfect
summer
beer
d
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
the
aroma
really
is
hindering
my
enjoyment
overall
a
solid
amber
from
bells
as
smooth
balanced
as
they
come
while
still
maintaining
an
interesting
profile
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
a
few
times
a
year
if
it
were
to
ever
hit
the
shelves
in
california
works
as
a
good
summer
beer
although
its
a
little
maltier
than
i
like
my
ambers
the
toasted
character
is
highly
emphasized
but
doesnt
seem
to
hold
on
all
the
way
through
especially
when
the
strong
grainy
bitterness
comes
around
i
wish
the
hops
were
a
little
bit
more
present
as
well
and
the
same
goes
for
the
initial
cereal
flavors
i
found
satisfying
solid
but
not
my
favorite
offering
by
bells
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
bells
amber
ale
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
an
amber
ale
it
has
a
nicely
complex
taste
with
a
great
sweetness
to
it
ill
definitely
grab
this
one
again
sometime
cheers
a
real
nice
brew
to
accompany
a
good
evening
meal
drink
i
had
to
drive
home
but
would
have
loved
to
stick
around
for
a
few
more
pints
of
this
nice
little
beer
maybe
as
well
constructed
as
this
particular
style
can
be
but
this
genre
has
a
lot
of
mushy
tasteslikeawholeheckofalotofnothing
beers
in
it
and
so
really
damning
with
faint
praise
here
not
awful
this
is
actually
a
higher
score
than
id
expected
to
give
it
but
i
doubt
id
ever
knowingly
go
looking
for
it
again
this
amber
constraints
on
the
roasted
nutty
qualities
of
the
malt
and
doesnt
showcase
huge
hops
as
so
many
ambers
seem
to
be
doing
for
that
i
say
thanks
overall
an
aboveaverage
amber
ale
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
its
definitely
drinkable
and
tastier
than
a
lot
of
the
other
massproduced
amber
ales
out
there
overall
solid
amber
ale
absolutely
would
buy
this
again
i
believe
this
is
the
least
impressive
bells
beer
i
have
tasted
so
far
pours
a
hazy
amberbrown
with
tons
of
yeast
chunkies
throughout
aroma
is
of
light
grain
taste
is
big
toffee
toasty
grain
flavor
up
front
followed
by
some
earthy
fruity
flavors
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
a
good
amber
ale
that
i
would
get
again
o
i
am
not
a
red
ale
fan
so
i
did
my
best
but
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
i
love
bells
and
i
think
they
turn
out
quality
beer
regardless
of
style
this
beer
is
good
and
has
no
real
drawbacks
but
there
is
also
nothing
really
to
take
notice
too
either
refreshing
and
an
extremely
solid
brew
good
year
round
for
session
or
to
maybe
convert
a
few
macro
folks
approachable
and
i
recommend
this
overall
a
good
classic
interpretation
of
an
american
amber
ale
well
brewed
and
well
rounded
o
its
an
excellent
beer
great
for
sessions
easygoing
good
balance
of
everything
most
excellent
recommended
cheers
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
crisp
with
mild
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
as
this
ale
is
balanced
so
perfectly
no
flavor
over
powers
the
other
making
this
ale
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
only
question
that
comes
to
mind
is
can
i
have
another
because
bells
nailed
this
style
do
goes
down
smooth
easydrinkin
i
could
knock
this
back
in
large
quantities
im
attributing
a
significant
percentage
of
the
flavor
here
to
hop
addition
and
therefore
i
do
believe
freshness
would
be
a
concern
here
moreso
than
for
many
other
amberred
ales
if
fresh
i
could
blast
a
sixpack
of
this
this
beer
pours
up
a
nice
coppery
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
subtle
to
my
nose
i
could
really
only
pick
up
what
smelled
a
little
like
cinammon
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
taste
is
nice
kind
of
grass
biscuit
and
hops
the
malt
upfront
is
kind
of
buried
in
the
mix
though
not
too
bad
about
what
i
expect
from
bells
not
being
a
big
fan
of
ambers
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
overall
i
will
say
its
not
my
favorite
beer
not
even
close
but
it
is
as
close
to
the
perfect
straight
amber
ale
as
ive
ever
tasted
and
according
to
the
way
we
try
to
rate
beers
here
this
deserves
one
of
the
best
ratings
ive
given
again
there
are
dozens
of
beers
i
personally
enjoy
more
but
that
being
said
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
straight
amber
ive
ever
had
give
it
a
try
if
you
find
a
single
pass
on
a
six
pack
though
o
definitely
lives
up
to
the
bells
name
my
favorite
offering
of
the
amber
ale
style
without
a
doubt
i
will
recommend
and
purchase
again
overall
i
thought
right
off
the
bat
id
be
let
down
as
soon
as
i
caught
a
whiff
i
was
happy
to
see
that
the
taste
isnt
much
like
the
aroma
at
all
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
the
more
i
drank
it
and
i
feel
id
just
enjoy
it
more
if
i
tried
it
again
a
very
good
amber
if
you
can
get
passed
the
smell
taste
is
amazing
wow
this
is
the
first
beer
thats
really
surprised
in
a
good
way
me
in
a
while
initially
its
pretty
sweet
and
malty
almost
to
the
point
that
youd
think
it
was
going
overtake
the
beer
but
then
after
a
second
or
two
the
sweetness
completly
dissapaits
and
you
get
some
caramely
malts
and
a
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
well
rounded
balaced
beer
there
is
also
this
carbonated
tingling
that
is
unexplainable
but
great
never
expierienced
that
before
but
loved
it
move
over
alaskan
and
full
sail
this
is
my
new
favorite
amber
sessionable
o
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
aroma
and
maltiness
for
the
style
the
palate
opens
with
a
nice
blend
of
toasted
and
caramel
malt
with
some
cotton
candy
brown
sugar
and
bread
notes
all
light
and
in
great
balance
the
is
accompanied
by
the
hop
character
which
is
soft
and
resplendent
with
a
blend
of
sweet
grapefruit
pine
and
oranges
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
mildly
chewy
feel
and
midpalate
this
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
and
is
a
treat
on
the
palate
this
is
a
pretty
excellent
amber
if
you
ask
me
highly
recommended
pours
out
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
short
lived
but
prettywhileitlasts
head
no
lacing
smells
of
biscuit
dough
and
a
touch
of
caramel
apple
with
just
a
whispered
hint
of
pie
spicing
tastes
about
evenly
of
bready
notes
and
fruity
esters
with
a
clean
bitter
finish
crisp
texture
and
medium
carbonation
levels
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
bells
amber
ale
a
very
nice
light
beer
here
brings
some
nice
flavor
to
the
table
but
does
not
overwhelm
should
be
good
for
the
average
beer
drinker
as
well
as
people
with
a
more
refined
taste
oa
nice
easy
drinking
american
great
not
great
but
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
pretty
tasty
amber
well
worth
a
try
bottle
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
aroma
includes
a
little
funk
some
floral
notes
light
bready
malts
and
a
bit
of
fruit
light
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
flavor
is
somewhat
watered
down
for
my
tastes
light
bready
malts
just
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
and
caramel
something
about
this
just
didnt
seem
right
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
simplistic
the
caramel
takes
the
forefront
with
a
subtle
hop
character
its
easy
to
drink
but
ultimately
boring
overall
a
pretty
nice
easy
drinking
beer
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
overall
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
brew
with
a
nice
light
sweetness
that
is
offset
by
the
mild
hoppy
bitterness
overall
this
really
is
a
great
amber
ale
it
wont
ever
get
the
love
and
praise
it
deserves
it
is
just
a
solidly
wellmade
beer
of
course
coming
fr
bells
i
would
expect
no
less
amber

one
of
my

nonipa

poured
from

a

overall
this
is

12

pours
a
very
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
nice
1
finger
dense
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
biscuit
toast
caramel
light
citrus
floral
and
nuttiness
some
pretty
good
well
balanced
aromas
that
are
a
bit
muted
taste
of
caramel
biscuit
grapefruit
orange
floral
toast
nuttiness
and
light
pine
light
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
caramel

and
light
pine
on
the

for
a
short
bit
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
good
balance

flavors
with
the
malt
backbone
medium
carbonation

body
with

creamy
and
slightly
crisp

alcohol
is

with
pretty
much
no
warming
noticed
at
all
on
the
finish
very
easy
to
drink
as
expected
for
5
8
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
amber
ale
nice
flavor
balance
and
smoothness
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
o
a
decent
amber
but
nothing
remarkable
this
one
by
bells
is
a
typical
amber
alewell
typically
good
nothing
really
bad
about
it
but
nothing
stands
out
as
better
than
the
rest
out
there
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
no
bitterness
caramel
smooth
finish
and
the
cloudy
appearance
makes
it
somewhat
different
a
uniquely
flavored
amber
ale
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
and
well
paired
with
a
strong
cheese
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
could
be
sessionable
though
it
is
approaching
a
touch
too
strong
in
abv
to
have
more
than
a
few
pours
reddish
brown
with
no
head
at
all
aromas
of
caramel
malt
a
bit
of
bread
and
maple
vanila
and
a
faint
nuttiness
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
hops
thrown
in
pretty
nice
ive
had
this
in
bottles
several
times
and
it
is
noticeably
more
enjoyable
on
cask
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
faintly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
style
i
normally
dont
enjoy
that
much
except
for
hoppier
ambers
but
on
cask
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
o
an
amber
ale
thats
all
about
traditional
flavor
not
bold
unique
character
and
in
that
way
its
all
that
it
can
be
quite
sessionable
overall
one
of
the
more
full
flavored
amber
ales
and
very
drinkable
o
nice
beer
i
can
drink
this
any
season
and
really
enjoy
bells
interpretation
of
this
style
i
also
like
the
new
label
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
true
to
its
name
with
a
thin
head
that
receded
into
a
thinner
cap
and
oily
lacing
some
sediment
and
better
than
average
carbonation
very
nice
nose
of
malt
and
resin
with
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
followed
the
nose
with
good
bread
and
some
grass
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
from
this
light
to
mediumbodied
brew
tasted
toward
the
back
of
the
mouth
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
tasted
recently
they
call
it
the
flagship
of
bells
and
while
i
havent
had
the
coveted
hopslam
yet
its
the
best
bells
offering
ive
had
o
good
session
brew
overall
while
tasty
its
pretty
run
of
the
mill
as
far
as
ambers
go
id
take
a
stone
levitation
over
this
still
worth
a
try
though
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
one
of
the
better
easily
accessible
amber
ales
out
there
not
of
toasted
and
bready
malts
in
the
nose
and
some
sweet
fruity
malts
in
the
taste
very
easy
to
drink
could
see
a
lot
of
noncraft
beer
drinkers
enjoying
this
wouldnt
buy
it
too
often
but
worth
checking
out
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
khaki
head
wonderful
retention
and
lacing
shockingly
so
for
an
amber
a
nice
sweet
bready
aroma
mixed
with
a
little
fruit
a
sweet
and
smooth
flavor
sugary
toffee
a
little
banana
bread
and
a
touch
of
lemon
i
usually
dislike
toffee
but
they
do
a
nice
job
with
it
here
it
isnt
too
strong
and
dominating
a
creamy
medium
bodied
to
this
not
too
much
carbonation
a
very
representation
of
an
an
amber
though
not
my
favorite
amber
i
have
tried
ive
long
been
wanting
to
check
out
some
bells
offerings
so
glad
to
have
finally
tried
something
by
them
still
wish
it
could
have
been
2
hearted
instead
though
deep
copper
hue
a
little
haze
but
a
great
head
that
starts
out
fluffy
and
then
collapses
in
on
itself
to
stick
around
and
stay
thick
malt
and
a
bit
of
bread
on
the
nose
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
some
more
complex
grainy
character
incredibly
delicious
beer
the
bread
shows
up
here
and
so
do
the
hops
the
malt
doesnt
bail
wow
this
beer
has
a
great
depth
of
flavor
and
remarkable
interplay
and
balance
in
the
elements
of
its
taste
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
decent
bodied
but
doesnt
require
chewing
carbonated
but
doesnt
try
to
jump
back
up
your
throat
overall
a
terrific
example
of
what
basic
american
microbrewing
is
at
its
best
it
doesnt
need
to
be
crazy
hoppy
this
is
a
wellbalanced
totally
thought
out
beer
that
being
said
it
is
simply
not
the
type
to
knock
your
socks
off
and
be
a
onceinalifetime
thats
ok
by
me
ill
happily
keep
this
in
my
mental
list
of
goto
basics
for
the
rest
of
my
life
do
this
amber
ale
is
satisfactory
in
its
ability
to
capture
some
english
plae
ale
qualities
while
remaining
clean
and
versatile
hopping
is
light
but
appropriate
while
malt
components
are
varied
and
interesting
without
being
challenging
o
i
like
that
the
grains
and
breads
are
balanced
with
some
hops
heft
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
o
another
good
offering
from
bells
an
easy
drinking
amber
ale
with
decent
flavor
o
at
first
i
was
not
real
keen
on
this
one
but
after
a
few
sips
it
really
opened
up
for
me
this
is
yet
another
solid
offering
from
bells
d
a
solid
straightforward
amber
malty
but
smooth
and
easy
drinking
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
slightly
golden
amber
with
a
solid
head
that
is
hanging
around
the
malt
is
solid
with
a
lasting
taste
the
hopy
note
is
rather
light
with
no
real
bitterness
it
has
the
right
refreshing
fell
in
the
mouth
nice
and
bubbly
i
prefer
a
strong
ipa
so
this
was
surprising
how
good
it
was
to
me
i
recomend
this
fine
amber
ale
from
bells
plenty
of
carbonation
greets
the
tongue
and
lingers
throughout
the
semidry
finish
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
the
feel
is
slightly
thin
theres
no
doubt
this
makes
a
good
wellbalanced
session
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
stay
satisfying
o
a
solid
beer
that
tastes
good
and
is
quite
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
it
i
also
wouldnt
recommend
going
out
of
your
way
for
it
because
imho
there
are
slightly
better
amber
ales
that
can
be
found
quite
easily
this
beer
pours
a
bold
clear
amber
with
a
thin
head
and
lace
lasting
to
the
end
its
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
malt
dough
pine
and
straw
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
notes
of
roasted
nuts
bread
crust
and
a
hint
of
toffee
in
the
background
theres
a
smooth
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bells
amber
ale
is
a
good
brew
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
recommended
o
seems
just
an
average
amber
nothing
special
but
a
decent
beer
worth
another
shot
overall
this
is
an
average
amber
ale
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
taste
isnt
bad
and
its
easy
to
drink
nice
nose
on
this
beer
as
well
just
nothing
great
ill
review
again
when
i
come
across
a
more
fresh
bottle
pours
an
orangecopper
color
w
a
thin
off
white
head
good
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
lots
of
yeast
hanging
out
in
this
brew
just
enjoying
life
living
in
a
bells
beer
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
fruit
yeast
a
very
nice
smelling
brew
very
balanced
and
pleasant
the
taste
follows
the
nose
exactly
with
hops
being
added
to
the
mix
very
tasty
for
the
style
feel
is
medium
creamy
with
a
nice
full
finish
overall
another
solid
brew
from
bells
cheers
mouth
feel
is
not
too
bad
does
not
linger
too
long
and
feels
a
little
light
on
your
tongue
this
beer
tastes
like
very
mild
soap
this
could
be
the
diacetyl
and
that
is
not
a
good
thing
starts
off
tasting
fine
and
then
turns
into
dishwater
this
is
one
of
the
more
unpleasant
beers
i
have
had
perhaps
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
makes
a
nice
change
from
the
porters
and
stouts
ive
been
drinking
recently
and
i
can
definitely
see
myself
getting
more
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
too
with
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
finish
certainly
a
solid
easytodrink
ale
that
would
make
an
ideal
gateway
ale
towards
craftier
ales
solid
o
solid
amber
ale
option
reviewed

o
a
drinkable
smooth
ale
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
preferences
but
there
is
nothing
glaringly
wrong
with
it
o
most
amber
ales
dont
stand
out
and
tend
to
all
blend
together
this
one
may
not
be
a
unique
step
forward
but
its
definitely
a
step
up
a
great
amber
ale
for
sure
overall
its
better
than
i
remember
i
definitely
appreciate
the
balance
of
this
beer
much
more
now
but
when
twohearted
is
sitting
on
the
shelf
next
to
it
i
know
what
im
gonna
reach
for
overall
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
but
well
made
good
flavor
very
sessionable
o
a
very
good
amber
ale
much
more
than
i
expected
i
will
have
to
add
this
to
my
regular
inventory
overall
a
simple
beer
simply
done
well
very
tastly
easy
to
drink
and
low
alcohol
make
this
a
easy
beer
to
enjoy
very
well
done
and
easy
to
get
ahold
off
worth
a
drink
for
sure
do
just
a
nice
easy
drinker
from
bells
for
whatever
reason
this
beer
has
never
done
much
for
me
aside
from
the
appearance
and
drinkability
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
good
but
pretty
middle
of
the
road
on
tap
at
copper
cellar
knoxville
pours
amber
with
a
long
lasting
thick
white
head
aroma
is
of
ripe
fruit
and
caramel
malt
mediumfull
creamy
body
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
ripe
fruit
and
earthy
hops
some
hints
of
chocolate
long
dry
finish
tasty
session
brew
overall
a
very
good
ale
not
over
powering
but
still
with
great
taste
very
nicely
balanced
i
definately
recommend
d
a
bit
light
in
some
ways
but
oh
well
it
still
has
lots
of
flavor
character
and
is
very
balanced
a
rather
well
put
together
executed
amber
it
is
very
drinkable
but
at
5
8
it
is
getting
up
there
one
of
many
solid
anchors
in
bells
portfolio
i
was
able
to
sample
the
bells
amber
ale
at
the
bank
in
wheaton
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
and
thin
tan
head
which
laced
nicely
the
scent
was
a
sweet
malt
the
taste
included
a
sweet
malt
with
floral
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
ale
with
good
carbontation
overall
the
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
good
flavor
and
nothing
takes
over
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
clear
amber
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
fine
lace
throughout
on
the
nose
there
are
aromas
of
caramel
grain
toasted
malts
and
hints
of
fruit
and
pine
the
flavor
is
balanced
between
moderately
sweet
caramel
malts
and
earthy
piney
hops
the
finish
is
moderate
in
length
with
toasted
grain
on
the
palate
it
is
medium
in
body
with
a
smooth
watery
texture
and
soft
carbonation
an
excellent
and
easydrinking
amber
ale
this
is
an
awesome
amber
ale
a
perfect
session
beer
to
drink
all
night
a
perfect
amount
of
big
thanks
for
marc
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
flagship
beer
there
are
epic
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
and
had
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkabilitly
on
this
beer
is
huge
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
ive
ever
had
o
decent
sweeter
and
very
carmel
forward
overall
a
triedandtrue
american
ale
overall
a
decent
allaround
beer
i
much
prefer
their
porter
twohearted
ale
and
oberon
wheat
but
this
beer
is
also
worth
checking
out
when
looking
for
a
solid
middleoftheroad
style
of
beer
overall
not
bad
certainly
not
in
my
top
10
bells
list
however
for
their
flagship
beer
it
would
seem
like
theyd
put
a
bit
more
effort
into
getting
the
flavor
out
there
recommended
if
you
enjoy
lightly
hopped
sweet
ambers
pretty
much
the
definitiion
for
an
amber
ale
poured
at
about
the
right
temperature
for
a
small
to
medium
light
tan
head
that
soon
settled
out
color
is
a
clear
honey
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
beer
and
a
little
roast
hop
and
fruit
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
just
a
little
sweetness
to
balance
the
carbonic
tang
and
slight
roast
and
hop
body
is
superb
with
excellent
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
slowly
fades
with
no
off
notes
super
easy
drinking
beer
easy
to
drink
refreshing
beer
i
almost
always
have
a
bottle
or
two
in
the
fridge
o
springsummer
beer
to
enjoy
with
loved
ones
and
friends
overall
really
great
for
the
style
i
think
its
a
totally
overlooked
style
and
i
understand
its
not
exciting
but
for
the
style
this
beer
is
excellent
its
one
of
those
beers
i
could
drink
all
day
o
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
isnt
too
malty
overall
like
all
the
bells
beers
im
very
impressed
this
is
a
great
amber
this
is
a
good
example
of
amber
i
recommend
trying
it
out
o
makes
sense
that
this
is
the
original
bells
beer
since
its
so
flavorful
yet
drinkable
and
just
an
allaround
great
session
beer
cheers
solid
amber
ale
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
amber
ale
this
beer
is
exactly
what
a
great
amber
ale
should
be
light
great
balance
between
malts
and
hops
great
looks
great
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
i
could
have
drank
a
six
pack
of
this
in
a
sitting
its
got
good
flavor
and
it
goes
down
so
smooth
that
i
cant
help
but
want
to
grab
another
one
this
is
also
a
great
beer
to
have
with
dinner
and
goes
great
with
a
steak
or
a
bratwust
what
i
like
most
about
this
beer
is
pretty
much
everything
it
looks
good
it
smells
good
it
tastes
good
and
it
feels
good
its
firing
on
all
cylinders
there
isnt
really
anything
i
dont
like
or
would
change
about
this
beer
it
is
fine
just
the
way
it
is
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
as
i
have
for
a
while
now
its
a
great
example
of
its
style
and
i
will
always
have
room
in
my
fridge
for
a
six
pack
this
beer
should
be
tried
by
everyone
and
if
you
love
amber
ales
this
is
one
of
the
best
widely
available
ones
so
far
this
has
been
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
had
it
has
the
right
amount
of
balance
that
to
me
makes
the
perfect
amber
ale
bells
really
does
a
great
job
at
making
a
beer
to
style
with
great
balance
i
find
a
lot
of
amber
ales
are
either
malt
forward
or
hop
forward
but
this
beer
was
right
in
the
middle
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
done
other
brewers
need
to
take
note
this
is
a
classic
amber
ale
the
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
reddish
looking
color
with
a
pretty
good
looking
head
on
top
that
isnt
afraid
to
stick
around
for
a
little
while
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
too
much
like
the
nose
there
are
plenty
of
hops
and
malts
working
together
to
make
this
a
nice
drinkable
beer
the
mouthfeel
isnt
overwhelming
at
all
its
drinkable
and
easy
to
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
if
you
want
to
overall
this
beer
is
worth
trying
i
think
m
o
the
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
and
creamy
softness
that
gives
the
beer
a
buttery
feel
and
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
most
anytime
my
boyfriend
strongly
dislikes
the
new
bottle
art
that
said
its
a
good
beer
hazy
amber
with
a
huge
head
and
a
floral
hopsbready
malts
kind
of
nose
taste
is
caramel
biscuit
some
nice
zingy
lemonfloral
hops
perfectly
carbonated
and
creamy
mouthfeel
nothing
standout
but
really
a
solid
amber
its
deep
hazy
amber
color
reminds
me
of
cider
and
its
frothy
head
retains
shape
similar
to
a
nice
cafe
latte
the
aroma
smells
of
fresh
baked
bread
with
a
hint
of
juicy
grapefruit
hidden
beneath
when
tasting
the
beer
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
grains
tropical
fruit
and
a
piny
zing
towards
the
end
reasonably
full
mouth
feel
while
it
is
not
thick
it
coats
the
mouth
pleasantly
a
good
beer
for
any
time
this
amber
brings
out
the
best
of
its
kind
of
beers
while
utilizing
hops
in
a
more
prominent
yet
subdued
role
awesome
beer
and
a
new
session
beer
for
me
over
all
i
am
impressed
this
beer
explained
to
me
the
rave
about
bells
honestly
i
had
to
question
it
before
this
beer
well
done
overall
it
is
a
very
good
ale
that
is
refreshing
and
has
an
original
flavor
i
have
not
yet
experienced
in
an
ale
o
very
solid
selection
for
an
amber
ale
excellent
drinkability
with
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
ive
had
this
on
cask
before
and
very
much
enjoyed
it
i
think
it
is
better
suited
in
a
bottle
though
being
that
this
is
bells
flagship
beer
you
know
it
has
to
be
well
made
sure
its
a
no
frills
nothing
special
kinda
beer
but
it
is
done
very
well
and
easy
to
enjoy
an
ok
amber
ale
the
expected
fruity
sweetness
turned
on
its
head
opting
for
the
acidic
in
lieu
of
the
sugary
complement
overall
i
love
a
solid
red
ale
and
this
is
no
exception
a
good
classic
amber
ale
one
of
the
best
ambers
ive
ever
had
at
least
rated
another
great
beer
by
bells
i
decided
to
update
my
review
after
realizing
i
first
tried
this
in
a
duvel
glass
which
does
not
do
this
beer
any
favors
tried
in
a
standard
pint
glass
the
flavor
profile
changes
a
bit
and
for
the
better
the
flavors
became
more
intense
and
a
bit
more
complex
drink
this
one
in
a
pint
glass
and
you
will
find
it
to
be
a
nice
beer
o
its
nice
nothing
special
but
nice
o
very
drinkable
brew
would
recommend
to
a
friend
overall
i
like
it
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hoppy
beer
as
of
right
now
but
the
balance
of
this
beer
with
some
hoppy
bite
may
be
a
way
to
acquire
that
taste
would
drink
this
again
and
recommend
to
a
friend
ogood
solid
beer
i
will
get
again
o
solid
amber
ale
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
get
this
again
o
this
amber
ale
is
really
drinkable
and
i
loved
everything
about
it
but
i
do
with
it
had
a
bit
more
of
an
aroma
still
one
of
my
new
favorites
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
laces
nicely
has
a
light
clean
malt
smell
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
light
and
malty
on
the
front
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
and
back
very
refreshing
with
a
medium
thin
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
good
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
delightful
amber
ale
overall
a
beer
for
the
drunk
in
us
all
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
the
next
morning
it
has
some
nice
balance
to
it
in
fact
balance
is
its
strength
i
wish
i
could
have
this
one
on
tap
i
bet
i
would
end
up
giving
it
a
higher
review
if
the
beer
were
actually
taken
care
of
by
the
retailer
o
a
very
sold
beer
i
cant
remember
what
exactly
it
was
like
because
it
was
at
a
pub
and
i
have
had
several
other
drinks
since
then
but
either
way
a
solid
brew
and
a
first
time
for
this
one
for
me
very
surprised
this
for
a
red
beer
is
a
winner
o
overall
id
imagine
this
would
be
a
different
story
fresh
on
tap
but
this
6
pack
has
been
a
bit
underwhelming
and
falls
short
of
what
i
expect
hope
for
in
an
amber
ale
decent
but
forgettable
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
really
malty
on
the
forward
the
finish
is
heavy
and
syrupy
with
a
mild
hop
presence
the
beer
in
the
middle
is
a
little
heavy
and
still
sweet
with
the
malt
overall
it
is
a
malty
red
nothing
too
special
but
drinkable
for
sure
bells
amber
is
a
classic
but
i
dont
find
it
to
be
one
of
their
better
offerings
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
have
at
parties
down
in
kzoo
when
my
friends
were
going
to
western
for
college
but
it
is
not
really
a
beer
i
ever
buy
anymore
unless
it
is
the
only
bells
available
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
ambers
though
you
may
think
differently
appears
cloudy
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
malty
and
balanced
hop
presence
is
muted
taste
is
well
balanced
biscuity
and
smooth
a
little
sweet
citrus
hop
action
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
average
to
good
very
pleasant
and
easy
going
carbonation
is
medium
overall
a
decent
amber
ale
not
knockin
my
socks
off
though
just
sayin
this
would
be
nice
to
keep
around
for
guests
and
easy
drinkin
nights
overall
a
great
amber
ale
maybe
not
my
favorite
a
title
which
belongs
to
troegs
hopback
but
certainly
worthy
of
trying
balanced
drinkable
and
plenty
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
would
love
to
make
this
a
staple
in
my
fridge
d
a
respectable
american
amber
simple
straightforward
and
fairly
effective
nothing
special
but
no
real
complaints
either
a
solid
flagship
brew
for
bells
o
an
okay
amber
ale
but
not
really
any
better
than
any
number
of
amber
ales
ive
had
easy
drinking
with
good
flavor
and
nothing
takes
over
a
good
fairly
subtle
amber
to
drink
a
few
of
hoppy
finish
increases
but
not
considerably
o
overall
pretty
good
but
doesnt
stand
above
other
good
amber
ales
this
beers
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
a
lacey
head
that
did
hang
out
for
a
while
the
smell
is
malty
and
a
bit
eartly
the
taste
is
malty
a
bit
sweet
and
very
full
doesnt
have
that
offesnive
dirt
taste
like
the
smell
may
indicate
good
full
flavor
doesnt
stay
on
the
paletee
forever
overall
a
decent
amber
ale
and
enjoyable
i
would
get
again
but
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
amber
colored
beer
that
had
a
head
with
some
okay
retention
and
some
small
lacing
on
the
sides
it
smells
mostly
of
caramel
malts
and
grain
and
has
just
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
there
taste
is
really
a
lot
like
the
nose
although
the
hops
are
not
quite
as
much
as
i
thought
they
would
be
some
mediumlevel
carbonatoin
and
the
beer
has
a
good
syrupy
coating
aspect
to
it
while
managing
not
to
get
too
heavy
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
but
i
wish
there
was
more
hops
in
it
o
bells
amber
ale
isnt
by
any
means
the
best
amber
on
the
market
but
it
isnt
half
bad
i
dont
see
myself
reaching
for
this
one
often
but
will
make
a
point
of
returning
to
it
down
the
road
in
the
meantime
there
are
plenty
of
other
ambers
ill
be
grabbing
over
this
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
hazy
amber
body
with
2
fingers
of
off
white
head
that
does
leave
some
lacing
a
nice
array
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malts
have
been
apparent
from
the
initial
pour
well
balanced
on
the
tongue
the
hops
are
upfront
and
fairly
prominent
but
give
them
a
few
seconds
as
a
nice
malty
finish
is
coming
also
a
great
feel
to
this
amber
ale
medium
bodied
and
maybe
a
touch
under
average
carbonation
and
has
a
creamy
texture
quite
nice
i
really
liked
this
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
bells
o
i
could
drink
bells
amber
all
day
long
this
would
make
a
really
nice
beer
to
ween
bmc
drinkers
off
the
big
boys
teet
o
the
flavor
is
better
and
more
complex
than
i
had
hoped
for
definitely
a
buy
again
overall
impression
not
the
best
from
bells
im
hopping
there
was
going
to
be
more
mouthfeel
and
flavor
but
too
sweet
for
a
amber
ale
wont
go
back
to
this
beer
but
wouldnt
sway
someones
opinion
to
a
negative
one
about
this
beer
taste
bready
caramel
fruit
very
subdued
and
integrated
hops
flavours
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
while
it
seems
a
bit
heavy
after
drinking
it
i
look
forward
to
having
another
o
i
havent
had
a
beer
from
bells
that
i
didnt
like
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
probably
the
best
that
ive
had
at
5
5
id
see
this
as
a
decent
session
beer
it
drinks
really
well
wouldnt
have
a
problem
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
an
amber
copper
colored
beer
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
ok
lace
teh
smell
is
of
biscuits
caramel
and
earthy
hops
the
balance
is
very
well
done
hops
make
theirself
known
with
some
grassy
earthy
notes
and
a
hint
of
spice
but
dominated
with
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
creamy
edge
overall
a
nice
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
amber
ale
simple
but
great
o
as
i
keep
purchasing
this
brewerys
beer
i
can
only
say
great
beer
and
will
go
back
to
it
time
and
time
again
o
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
i
tend
to
like
them
with
more
carmel
flavor
and
a
little
more
hoppy
still
not
a
bad
beer
12oz
bottle
batch
10159
bottled
on
jan
19
2011
pours
an
ubercloudy
dark
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
as
a
capper
retention
is
lacking
no
lace
left
behind
boring
the
nose
is
mildly
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
caramel
crackers
hops
are
surprisingly
absent
in
the
nose
again
sort
of
boring
nice
medium
chew
to
the
body
decent
carbonation
level
backs
it
up
and
carries
it
through
to
the
end
have
i
become
jaded
by
all
the
highlyhopped
ambers
out
there
this
one
comes
across
as
mellow
albeit
flavorful
lots
of
sweet
malts
mild
hop
bite
bready
finish
theres
a
faint
citrus
tartness
to
it
on
the
back
end
but
its
fleeting
allinall
this
was
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
stress
too
much
to
get
some
more
but
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
turn
down
o
a
pretty
solid
amber
all
around
its
unique
from
others
in
that
the
yeast
notes
play
a
bigger
role
than
other
brews
it
challenges
the
drinker
with
something
other
than
a
hoploaded
amber
like
the
rest
of
the
world
produces
wellbalanced
here
d
i
polished
this
off
pretty
quickly
probably
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
i
think
i
had
this
recently
as
in
last
week
going
with
bells
amber
ale
4
some
malts
present
in
the
taste
not
much
by
way
of
hops
balanced
tasteneither
too
sweet
or
bitter
good
session
beer
but
a
little
forgettable
i
wonder
how
this
would
taste
on
tap
most
beers
taste
different
on
tap
not
saying
they
taste
better
just
different
man
that
aftertaste
just
isnt
going
away
bravo
bells
nice
sweet
malty
caramel
flavors
which
give
way
to
some
creamy
nuttiness
some
nice
hop
bitterness
finishes
it
off
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easydrinking
beer
the
hops
contribute
but
dont
bite
too
hard
there
are
no
questionable
offflavors
or
odd
qualities
a
good
session
beer
with
a
nice
balance
if
youre
a
real
hop
head
you
might
be
a
little
disappointed
sometimes
i
get
tired
of
all
my
beers
tasting
like
ipas
so
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
its
a
great
example
of
this
style
d
very
high
i
really
like
this
beer
it
could
become
a
new
standard
amber
for
me
o
a
good
beer
and
a
very
nice
everyday
drinker
surprised
i
havent
picked
up
one
of
these
before
but
i
certainly
will
again
o
i
might
have
found
my
staple
beer
whether
youre
a
session
drinker
or
not
this
beer
will
satisfy
both
sides
its
something
to
talk
about
and
something
to
have
on
hand
to
quench
your
thirst
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
really
tasty
amber
ale
just
sweet
enough
to
satisfy
but
not
get
cloying
the
citrus
note
of
the
hops
keeps
it
interesting
very
well
made
ill
have
another
overall
its
a
good
amber
however
if
im
going
for
a
sweet
amber
im
getting
a
duck
rabbit
overall
this
beer
transcended
my
expectation
and
has
opened
my
eyes
to
the
bold
and
exhilarating
world
of
red
ale
and
i
now
have
a
longing
for
more
o
a
little
disappointing
but
it
made
its
way
over
1000
miles
from
michigan
to
florida
definitely
tasted
better
when
i
had
it
on
tap
or
so
i
thought
this
beer
poured
a
very
light
amber
color
with
a
fizzle
of
perhaps
a
half
finger
of
white
foam
on
the
surface
the
aromatics
are
malty
and
pleasant
theres
nothing
much
to
them
but
there
doesnt
have
to
be
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
gives
this
beer
the
mild
caramel
sweetness
to
accent
the
premium
pale
malt
used
the
hops
tingle
on
the
palate
upfront
but
dont
really
leave
much
residual
bitterness
its
a
solid
beer
tastes
great
very
few
people
would
find
something
wrong
with
this
tasty
yet
simplistic
beer
i
have
already
recommended
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
do
so
poured
this
american
amber
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
and
produced
a
1
inch
white
head
head
retention
was
below
average
lacing
was
very
good
the
aroma
of
the
ale
was
full
of
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
hop
and
citrus
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
outstanding
it
was
very
drinkable
and
had
nice
body
the
beer
was
first
and
foremost
filled
with
roasted
and
malt
and
it
gave
way
to
a
nice
sweet
finish
high
drinkability
perfect
session
beer
this
is
the
most
outstanding
example
of
an
american
amber
ale
that
i
have
had
to
date
overall
a
decent
version
of
a
red
but
a
little
too
light
super
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
i
very
much
enjoy
this
style
mostly
for
its
tasty
simplicity
the
aroma
doesnt
suggest
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
but
despite
the
lack
of
complexity
its
quite
tasty
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
was
available
to
me
just
not
something
id
really
go
to
much
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
a
really
solid
malty
amber
nice
caramel
and
toasty
flavors
usually
not
a
fan
of
these
beers
but
this
was
pleasant
i
mean
its
not
unpleasant
but
theres
something
missing
here
i
could
drink
more
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
an
amber
but
nothing
too
extraordinary
i
want
to
give
it
more
credit
than
it
deserves
but
find
it
just
too
plain
it
is
was
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
sessionable
amberred
ale
i
just
wish
it
had
more
memorable
characteristics
overalla
very
drinkable
version
of
the
style
nothing
memorable
about
it
a
classic
version
of
a
midwesteast
coast
amber
focused
more
towards
malt
than
hops
i
prefer
the
hoppier
versions
of
the
style
that
being
said
a
very
drinkable
fullflavored
session
all
overall
bells
makes
so
many
great
beers
this
is
not
one
of
them
this
bells
beer
pours
to
a
beautiful
red
color
with
some
cloudiness
the
head
was
off
white
and
just
about
2
fingers
and
rolls
down
the
glass
with
every
sip
the
smell
was
malty
with
a
very
smooth
taste
i
loved
this
beer
from
the
first
sip
and
will
purchase
many
more
bells
makes
some
of
my
favorite
beers
and
the
amber
is
a
great
one
it
has
a
beautiful
copper
color
and
a
nice
clear
appearance
the
head
is
a
decent
sized
offwhite
it
has
a
mild
but
very
tasty
hops
profile
i
would
describe
the
body
as
being
on
the
lighter
side
which
makes
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
think
this
is
better
than
any
of
the
amber
ales
ive
had
in
awhile
it
might
not
be
strong
enough
for
some
people
at
least
compared
to
other
ambers
but
i
think
most
would
agree
that
it
tastes
great
im
wondering
whether
having
it
ontap
changed
the
feel
because
it
felt
much
thicker
to
me
than
it
seems
for
most
other
people
judging
from
the
other
reviews
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystal
clear
copper
coloring
with
a
thin
ring
of
film
for
head
the
nose
is
a
very
pleasant
mouth
watering
toasted
caramel
smell
in
mouth
the
beer
has
slightly
sour
caramel
flavors
riding
on
a
mild
bitter
hopped
backbone
round
and
slightly
oily
in
mouth
with
a
slick
finish
toasty
and
sour
aftertaste
with
lingering
bitter
and
sour
flavors
in
the
finish
decent
beer
but
not
mind
blowing
very
easy
to
drink
and
drink
lots
of
drinka
see
taste
d
very
drinkingable
beer
really
like
this
beer
nothing
amazing
about
this
beer
but
very
good
overall
d
a
decent
beer
here
more
than
i
would
have
expected
from
an
amber
a
nice
sessionable
drink
an
average
amber
ale
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
drinks
fine
but
the
flavors
dont
blow
me
away
drunkability
could
definitely
throw
a
sixer
down
of
these
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
if
i
was
craving
red
ale
d
at
the
price
these
were
at
a
beer
store
9
896pack
known
for
their
notoriously
great
deals
on
craft
beer
i
cannot
understand
why
this
didnt
come
across
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
im
no
cheapskate
but
these
are
simply
not
worth
their
value
oh
well
overall
this
is
an
average
amber
so
it
is
very
drinkable
however
i
just
dont
see
myself
purchasing
another
unless
the
price
comes
down
to
par
with
new
belgium
or
sierra
nevada
md
good
carbonation
easily
drinkable
representative
of
the
style
this
beer
should
be
a
staple
of
all
bars
and
pubs
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
a
good
beer
that
is
very
well
balanced
it
would
defiantly
appeal
to
all
types
of
taste
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
i
think
i
could
only
have
one
per
sitting
and
no
more
than
that
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
not
my
favorite
but
its
no
problem
very
sessionable
d
this
is
solid
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
dvery
good
done
with
my
beer
in
no
time
i
love
the
color
of
this
beer
a
deep
red
brown
the
immediate
taste
is
on
the
bitter
side
but
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
not
a
big
fan
of
the
after
taste
which
lingers
not
a
very
clean
taste
dark
undertones
of
malt
reminds
me
of
a
dark
chocolate
or
molasses
i
was
actually
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
ive
never
had
this
ordinary
bells
offering
before
go
figure
im
havin
now
then
i
guess
it
pours
a
clear
russetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
thick
caramel
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
flowers
the
taste
favors
the
orange
over
the
grapefruit
but
doesnt
really
deviate
from
the
smell
beyond
that
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
amber
nothing
standoutish
but
tasty
and
drinkable
regardless
pours
a
protein
particleinfused
amber
a
tannish
head
soon
becomes
a
ring
smell
is
clean
toasted
malts
i
get
some
mellow
hops
at
first
taste
then
that
nice
malty
backbone
smooth
silky
sweetness
it
is
then
another
round
of
bitterness
until
finally
mellowing
out
into
an
almost
minty
aftertaste
carbonated
well
and
lively
despite
not
looking
like
it
unique
but
almost
all
bells
are
drinks
good
cheers
not
a
bad
introductory
craft
brew
it
worked
for
me
nowadays
i
usually
reach
for
something
else
but
its
still
a
solid
standby
option
dthrough
the
roof
on
this
one
amazingly
more
flavor
than
the
original
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
the
abundance
of
flavor
carries
it
well
cheers
i
will
try
this
again
in
the
future
maybe
we
have
some
old
or
bad
batches
around
here
good
entry
level
craft
beer
not
worth
seeking
out
but
def
worth
quaffing
if
presented
with
one
in
the
taste
the
hop
bitterness
comes
through
more
but
with
the
caramel
taste
tames
it
some
it
feels
medium
bodied
it
taste
great
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
linger
a
little
would
make
a
good
session
beer
in
my
opinion
even
though
its
5
8
abv
slightly
out
of
the
definition
of
session
bottoms
up
these
go
down
easy

pretty
interesting
brew
not
terribly
complex
but
nicetasting
and
unique
nice
malty
flavor
with
some
light
sweet
citrus

flavor
in
the
background
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
brew
first
time
having
bells
amber
looks
good
sitting
in
the
glass
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
and
sharp
clarity
nose
is
subdued
but
smells
fresh
mostly
caramel
and
bready
malts
but
there
is
a
bit
of
earthy
hop
aroma
coming
through
palate
is
quite
mild
even
compared
to
the
nose
clean
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
small
hop
profile
moderate
body
with
a
proper
level
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
brew
that
could
easily
be
sessioned
although
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
in
the
flavor
department
nonetheless
worthy
of
a
try
the
previous
comment
takes
away
from
last
category
too
bad
it
seems
to
be
going
for
an
everyday
sort
of
drink
i
believe
it
was
referred
to
as
the
brewery
flagship
beer
in
which
it
probably
underrepresents
what
this
fine
brewery
is
capable
of
producing
nonetheless
a
adequately
drinkable
beer
that
id
like
to
give
a
shot
to
fresh
and
on
tap
d
nothing
special
but
something
that
you
can
sip
on
regularly
if
you
have
an
acquired
taste
for
it
d
not
a
huge
redamber
ale
fan
but
this
is
quite
good
try
this
offering
by
bells
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
body
with
medium

not
much
on
the

for
a

beer
but
it
makes
up
for
it
in

could
easily
drink
several
of
these

beer
overall
overall
a
winner
from

being
as
this
was
my

it
was
very

to
more
from
this
company
whenever
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
drinkability
a
good
pairing
for
indian
had
this
with
indian

meat

was
fantastic
a
good
beer
for

d
i
felt
like
i
was
back
in
london
drinking
this
lovely
cask
ale
drinkability
this
was
pleasantly
drinkable
with
some
nice
complexity
that
will
continue
to
develop
over
a
session
amber
is
not
my
style
of
choice
but
there
is
good
reason
why
this
is
their
flagship
beer
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
a
crowd
pleaser
and
caseworthy
d
very
high
great

very
good

tremendous
session
brew
another
top
shelf
effort
from
bells
who
are
among
the
top
breweries
right
now
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
as
well
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
about
medium
carbonation
too
it
works
well
with
the
flavor
profile
which
is
superdrinkable
by
the
way
it
lends
itself
to
huge
gulps
and
almost
tastes
like
apple
cider
if
i
close
my
eyes
and
drink
fast
a
great
beer
and
a
worthy
flagship
for
bells
anyone
should
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
d
very

cask

tons
of
character
to
this
beer
d
especially

served
fresh

brew
tm
more

then
i
remembered
it

medium

drinkability
is
a
wild
card
on
this
one
the
menagerie
of
initial
flavors
is
promising
and
the
mouthfeel
is
really
great
yet
this
is
still
a
pretty
unsatisfying
beer

within

style
there
are
many
other

and
it

i
found
the
beer
to
be
moderately
boring
have
had
much
better
for
the

i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
good
amber
ale
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
that
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
a
slight
hop
presence
it
smelled
pretty
average
for
an
amber
ale
the
taste
was
pretty
mild
it
was
sweet
and
a
bit
fruity
there
was
also
a
subtle
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
it
was
kind
of
lighter
bodied
with
low
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
it
went
down
smooth
and
was
pretty
refreshing
not
my
favorite
beer
from
bells
by
any
means
but
i
think
its
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
pours
a
deep
rich
looking

color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
a
little
hop

a
little

and
maybe
some

much
the

with
some

well
hops
are
well
balanced

offset
the

is
great
d
very
good
beer
one
of
the
better
ambers
that
i
have
had
nothing
too
special
but
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
this
has
some
things
i
love
about
amber
ale
and
about
beer
in
general
its
complex
its
doing
its
own
thing
and
it
isnt
overpowering
you
with
hops
which
i
think
can
be
left
to
ipa
let
me
use
the
word
again
balance
you
taste
the
awesome
floral
hops
and
even
a
bit
of
citrus
but
you
taste
the
classic
amber
malt
body
too
im
not
going
to
call
it
my
favorite
beer
but
its
possibly
my
favorite
amber
good
show
drinkability
this
all
in
all
is
not
a
bad
little
brew
nice
bit
of
warmth
at
the
end
the
beer
looks
great
and
is
very
enticing
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
its
a
brew
that
i
wouldnt
have
a
bit
of
trouble
quaffing
for
and
evening
d
very
drinkable
there
is
nothing
remarkable
going
on
here
but
the
beer
is
well
made
and
enjoyable
the
caramel
malt
character
is
particularly
well
done
and
makes
the
beer
a
touch
more
interesting
not
a
beer
to
sit
and
think
about
but
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
these
all
night
long
goes
down
easy
very
drinkable
bells
amber
pours
surprisingly
light
for
a
so
called
amber
ale
much
closer
to
a
burnt
tangerine
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
rises
up
and
then
fall
by
half
before
holding
for
a
while
lacing
is
serviceable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
nose
is
pretty
much
devoid
of
hops
which
i
guess
is
to
be
somewhat
expected
with
an
amber
thats
approaching
its
best
by
date
listed
on
the
bells
website
as
six
months
after
bottling
but
theres
definitely
still
some
caramel
and
biscuit
floating
around
the
hops
are
still
appreciable
on
my
palate
though
the
previously
mentioned
malty
flavors
lead
things
off
and
a
gentle
suggestion
of
bitterness
fades
into
a
bitter
grapefruit
and
pine
finish
this
beer
is
undoubtedly
a
bit
hoppier
fresh
but
tastewise
i
think
i
like
it
with
a
more
subdued
hop
influence
body
is
solid
but
not
overwhelming
though
the
brisk
carbonation
is
a
nice
touch
overall
i
found
myself
reaching
for
synonyms
for
decent
a
lot
while
writing
this
review
and
thats
a
good
way
to
describe
bells
amber
its
clearly
a
well
made
beer
but
one
that
didnt
wow
me
in
any
way
d
this
beer
pretty
much
grew
on
me
at
about
the
half
pint
mark
i
couldnt
really
drink
much
of
it
but
i
also
might
have
had
a
bad
bottle
i
will
rereview
this
beer
when
i
come
back
to
it
d
i
can
actually
find
six
packs
of
this
which
is
great
but
since
i
am
more
of
a
stout
kind
of
guy
i
really
would
like
more
for
my
dollar
very
nice
beer
for
the
variety
pack
though
simple
and
delicious
albeit
there
should
be
a
slight
malt
dominance
there
is
really
no
hop
presence
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
is
a
good
beer
its
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
get
in
my
area
would
make
a
great
session
beer
or
gateway
to
craft
beer
ill
definitely
have
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
as
this
is
almost
definitely
heading
down
the
road
to
an
infection
this
is
not
actually
horrible
tasting
though
and
is
even
somewhat
enjoyable
in
its
own
right
hopefully
bells
is
able
to
clean
up
this
infection
as
i
really
like
a
lot
of
their
beers
i
dont

to

but
overall
a
good
beer
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
ive
ever
had
overall
very
good
beer
overall
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
another
solid
offering
from
bells
drinkability
one
or
the
whole
six
pack
d
nothing
spectacular
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
a
good
solid
offering
from
bells
its
actually
a
very
tasty
beer
that
does
an
excellent
job
of
balancing
the
right
amount
of
hops
with
malt
awesome
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
very
solid
amber
ale
overall
d
very
easy
drinker
a
bit
earthymalty
but
could
drink
these
all
night
not
my
favorite
bells
offering
but
a
good
amber
nonetheless
d
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
its
a
more
than
decent
but
not
anywhere
near
outstanding
ive
had
much
better
brews
from
bells
and
better
amber
ales
than
this
drinkable
but
not
recommended
d
a
solid
amber
ale
not
overhopped
and
in
this
style
i
like
that
more
in
the
english
bitter
realm
we
all
know
bells
makes
some
amazing
brews
but
this
a
good
staple
to
pay
the
bills
notes
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
either
one
of
or
have
an
entire
six
pack
of
either
way
you
cannot
go
wrong
expectations
sometimes
get
really
high
with
certain
breweries
although
i
was
expecting
something
explosive
i
shouldnt
complain
too
much
about
this
beer
this
is
crispy
yet
a
little
chewy
along
with
a
slight
oily
slickness
this
makes
for
a
good
standby
to
go
to
for
the
american
red
ale
genre
imo
d
this
beer
hits
all
cylinders
and
can
transition
across
seasons
and
sessions
d
with
a
nice
medium
body
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
easy
drinking
brew
that
has
subtle
thickness
but
still
has
the
crisp
freshness

notessubtle
spiciness
sneaky
little
hop
bite
creamy
tasty
robust
and

with

interesting
and

would
make
a

or
a
perfect
entrylevel
beer
for
someone
interested
in
trying
a
craft
beer
m
very
well
balanced
good
co2
good
drinkable
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
wellrounded
beer
a
restrained
easygoing
amber
which
i
like
in
the
end
far
better
than
bells
pale
ale
worth
a
shot
notes
very
drinkable
the
beer
is
balanced
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
and
certainly
not
too
heavy
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
very
refreshing
with
lots
of
flavor
well
worth
the
money
d
one
of
the
best
ambers
ive
ever
had
definitely
coming
back
pours
a
copperamber
very
lightly
clouded
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
very
slowly
smell
a
bit
of
caramel
and
sweetness
the
malt
smell
is
present
but
the
smell
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
a
typical
amber
ale
a
hoppy
taste
with
a
stronger
malt
presence
with
just
a
bit
of
grapefruit
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
typical
for
you
average
amber
ale
the
drinkability
is
very
high
considering
this
beer
is
extremely
light
and
crisp
served
from
tap
into
a
standard
pint
pours
copper
with
a
minimal
white
head
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
present
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
only
subtle
hops
the
flavor
was
of
small
hops
and
subtle
sweet
malt
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
really
smooth
and
was
stupidly
drinkable
it
did
not
have
the
greatest
flavor
and
could
have
been
more
complex
but
it
was
still
enjoyed
and
was
really
refreshing
d
its
really
drinkable
because
its
nice
and
mild
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
with
hops
or
mouthfeel
but
its
not
nearly
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
ive
always
maintained
that
socalled
amber
ale
is
a
catch
all
style
for
brewers
to
throw
their
own
innovative
signature
into
it
this
one
although
not
bad
or
cheap
in
any
way
disappoints
if
for
nothing
more
than
its
ordinaryness
i
expected
more
from
this
brewer
on
the
upside
the
ale
is
tasty
balanced
properly
conditioned
and
made
for
sessioning
pours
amber
of
course
nice
malty
aroma
beautiful
carbonation
really
helps
the
mouthfeel
and
the
balanced
taste
could
be
my
favorite
amber
that
i
have
ever
had
so
drinkable
this
is
pretty
light
in
body
but
definitely
full
flavored
the
alcohol
stands
out
a
little
too
much
to
make
this
an
outstanding
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
stocking
this
hoppy
taste
even
for
bells
and
definitely
for
an
amber
makes
it
more
interesting
even
if
it
can
be
criticized
as
simply
being
a
hoppier
version
of
a
traditional
style
cool
with
me
a
little
sweetness
from
the
almost
balanced
beer
a
little
oily
as
well
not
hopped
over
the
top
should
appeal
to
a
wide
variety
of
drinkers
i
used
to
think
this
was
a
little
pricey
at
8
99
a
6er
but
now
everyone
charges
that
it
seems
d
a
great
quaffer
to
pair
with
food
less
hopped
than
other
ambers
though
delicious
in
its
own
unique
way
this
is
a
great
amber
ale
very
glad
i
went
with
a
6pack
instead
of
just
buying
a
single
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
since
the
only
way
to
buy
it
was
to
bring
your
own
growler
to
larry
at
the
window
in
the
old
warehouse
i
grew
up
in
kalamazoo
mi
and
it
was
a
happy
day
for
me
when
i
could
legally
make
that
stop
the
beer
has
always
had
a
fresh
amber
taste
medium
body
and
hops
and
medium
mouthfeel
never
heavy
or
light
a
good
allround
example
of
amber
ale
i
used
yeast
from
some
of
the
first
brewery
bottles
that
you
could
buy
to
brew
my
first
amber
ale
d
nice
full
flavor
and
good
balance
good
for
a
session
first
review
copper
in
color
two
fingers
of
head
when
poured
into
a
room
temperature
glass
a
mild
smell
with
a
pleasant
well
balanced
flavor
and
mouth
feel
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
a
very
good
drinkable
american
ale
one
of
those
full
flavor
very
drinkable
beers
that
is
not
a
watered
down
light
but
not
heavy
either
this
is
my
first
bells
amber
pleasantly
surprised
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
regularly
during
the
cooler
months
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
if
it
wasnt
old
i
would
probably
rate
it
at
an
a
because
im
really
enjoying
it
a
few
weeks
old
d
easily
a
sessionanble
amber
ale
with
some
great
flavor
definitely
gonna
pick
up
a
6er
real
quick
db
a
pretty
straight
forward
amber
with
a
nice
malthop
balance
the
light
fruits
are
nice
for
a
change
this
one
is
certainly
sessionable
but
not
for
me
since
i
only
have
a
six
pack
from
pa
the
price
was
good
and
the
beer
was
of
good
quality
i
will
try
more
and
more
bells
when
i
start
trading
or
go
back
to
pa
notes
this
beer
doesnt
do
anything
special
for
an
amber
ale
it
just
does
things
really
well
d
quite
drinkable
i
would
certainly
keep
this
beer
in
stock
for
a
bbq
or
a
pork
chop
dinner
maybe
even
a
ham
and
swiss
sandwich
with
mustard

this
is
a
highly
sessionable
brew
notes
a
great
beer
i
am
glad
it
was
recommended
to
me
by
my
local
bottle
shopman
i
have
been
on
an
amber
ale
kick
and
find
that
i
enjoy
the
balance
between
hops
and
malt
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
yet
needs
to
be
enjoyed
so
sip
slowly
or
make
sure
you
have
a
six
pack
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
good
carbonation
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
it
tickles
the
tongue
and
has
a
weight
to
it
but
allows
you
to
sample
other
beers
afterward
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
has
a
malt
backbone
sweet
malt
and
caramel
malt
with
some
breadiness
which
has
a
backend
taste
of
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
the
drinkability
is
good
for
an
amber
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
is
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
one
you
will
want
more
than
a
couple
of
this
one
pours
a
deep
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
yeast
and
more
yeast
tastes
of
yeast
and
not
much
else
not
a
bad
flavor
but
out
of
balance
id
have
preferred
to
have
a
bit
of
malt
in
there
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
better
ones
in
this
style
smells
of
sweet
malts
first
sip
is
that
of
a
scotch
ale
in
its
overall
malty
sweetness
in
fact
can
be
considered
the
majority
flavor
however
this
is
by
no
means
a
detriment
to
the
beer
itself
this
beer
is
a
tasty
brew
with
a
deep
and
complex
malty
flavors
a
real
pallet
pleaser
a
solid
yet
not
outstanding
offering
from
bells
its
okay
but
i
prefer
ambers
with
a
bit
more
body
and
hops
d
very
drinkable
brew
i
wouldve
had
more
but
so
many
more
brews
here
to
try
and
on
tap
d
very
drinkable
abv
less
than
expected
and
even
with
the
shortfall
in
the
hops
department
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
a
couple
overall
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
a
crisp
slightly
floral
amber
full
of
round
malty
notes
and
a
mild
hop
finish
it
pours
a
classic
caramel
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
develops
into
a
light
lacing
by
the
halfway
mark
not
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
sampled
but
its
smooth
and
supremely
drinkable
a
nice
local
discovery
for
this
born
and
bred
bostonian
who
now
calls
the
midwest
home
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
taste
and
aroma
are
both
malty
with
a
slight
fruitiness
banana
citrus
and
a
slightly
butterytoffee
character
generous
carbonation
which
lends
to
a
very
clean
crisp
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
not
a
world
beater
imo
but
a
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
beer
a
good
solid
drinking
beer
that
exemplifies
the
style
highly
recommended
for
those
times
when
you
wanna
drink
some
awesome
beer
that
you
dont
need
to
put
too
much
thought
into
i
got
this
from
mrkanable
in
a
trade
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
glass
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
is
amberorange
in
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malt
forward
sweet
and
roasty
the
flavors
a
sweet
breadish
a
lingering
sweet
finish
a
good
all
around
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
most
foods
one
of
the
better
bells
offerings
that
i
have
had
this
is
a
top
notch
amber
highly
recommended
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
ambers
i
have
had
and
the
only
disappointing
part
was
when
it
was
finished
d
really
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
the
lower
abv
coupled
with
a
wellbalanced
aroma
and
flavor
lead
to
a
really
good
beer
i
got
about
a
quarter
to
halfinch
thick
head
that
seems
to
be
planning
to
stick
around
for
good
or
at
least
until
im
through
with
the
beer
the
bottle
shows
the
abv
as
5
8
not
too
bad
definitely
sessionable
theres
a
little
over
a
hint
of
an
alcoholic
taste
coming
through
nothing
to
fuss
about
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
appropriate
to
the
degree
of
sweet
malts
every
bar
in
the
country
should
have
this
brew
available
i
really
stand
behind
this
beer
not
just
in
defense
of
microbreweries
and
the
culture
of
better
beer
but
for
the
fact
that
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
could
definitely
be
appreciated
by
the
most
closeminded
light
beer
aficionado
bells
amber
ale
should
serve
as
the
gateway
brew
to
better
beer
for
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
beer
drinkers
by
far
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
ive
had
the
balance
and
intensity
of
the
flavors
really
makes
this
one
unique
served
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
taste
is
pretty
good
overall
very
drinkable
for
an
amber
ale
poured
form
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
nice
head
that
stayed
till
the
last
sip
laced
my
glass
and
had
a
richgolden
brown
color
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
in
floating
around
smelled
of
malt
all
the
way
just
the
way
it
smelled
this
ale
tasted
of
malt
with
just
enough
bitter
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
easily
knock
a
few
back
cheers
absolute
session
beer
here
i
could
make
a
night
of
this
really
well
crafted
beer
thats
available
year
round
which
is
a
bonus
poors
a
nice
reddish
brown
but
not
too
dark
decent
sized
head
that
mostly
disappears
but
leaves
spots
of
lacing
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
molasses
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
malt
and
sugar
back
end
is
only
slightly
bitter
carbonation
and
viscosity
are
great
very
drinkable
but
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
enjoyable
brew
orangecopperish
color
with
a
thick
head
aroma
has
some
sweet
maltiness
to
it
taste
is
a
perfect
mix
of
bitter
and
sweet
initially
a
sweet
malt
taste
with
some
hints
of
nuts
and
caramel
but
by
the
time
you
finish
the
hops
kick
in
so
the
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
only
downside
is
that
the
taste
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
body
was
a
good
thickness
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
compared
to
what
else
was
available
but
still
cheap
enough
to
be
an
any
week
beer
as
always
i
find
myself
impressed
with
bells
and
wishing
it
were
easier
to
get
in
massachusetts
dthis
one
is
a
personal
favorite
i
love
a
solid
amber
and
this
is
definitely
a
fine
amber
very
easydrinking
session
beer
drinkability
great
by
the
books
amber
shines
high
in
its
category
and
proves
how
bells
is
one
of
americas
finest
breweries
would
be
good
with
a
steak
beyond
that
is
there
much
of
a
reason
this
would
be
sitting
in
my
fridge
not
so
much
there
are
many
other
bells
offerings
i
would
rather
drink
a
very
easy
drinker
tasty
and
simple
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
solid
session
beer
for
sure
my
first
bells
beer
ill
try
more
of
their
offerings
soon
light
medium
body
with
carbonation
right
where
it
should
be
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
offflavors
definitely
enjoyed
this
more
as
i
worked
my
way
through
it
a
solid
example
of
the
style
pors
a
beautiful
amber
color
as
it
should
right
its
perfect
for
the
style
it
has
a
bready
sweet
malt
caramel
and
hop
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
bready
spices
with
some
nice
hops
and
grass
and
citrus
tastes
this
is
a
really
good
amber
it
has
a
lot
of
nice
tastes
and
flavors
going
for
it
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
a
session
brew
i
like
this
one
they
say
it
is
their
flagship
beer
d
absolutely
a
session
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
i
would
and
will
pass
along
to
my
craftlightnoncraft
compatriots
but
also
drink
a
good
bit
myself
another
fantastic
offering
from
bells
d
very
drinkable
beer
teetering
on
the
edge
of
a
session
beer
definitely
makes
me
want
another
d
i
am
happy
to
rereview
this
beer
and
hopefully
ill
get
the
chance
to
try
it
on
tap
someday
but
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
another
bottle
out
very
hop
forward
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
and
slight
crisp
fruit
the
hops
dominate
this
beer
and
linger
all
the
way
through
over
the
malt
backbone
and
subtle
light
fruit
notes
in
to
a
bitter
dry
finish
d
pretty
easy
to
get
down
the
bite
at
the
end
gives
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
character
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
flavor
profile
that
makes
me
want
another
right
away
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
it
and
would
be
great
to
drink
another
just
not
something
im
craving
this
is
a
good
beer
that
can
be
consumed
easily
i
recommend
it
to
all
feel
moderate
soft
easy
drinker
with
pleasant
malt
balance
d
as
already
said
beer
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
great
beer
for
all
occasions
not
too
wildcrazy
in
variation
to
its
style
poured
a
yeast
cloudy
medium
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
sweet
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
slightly
smoky
no
bitter
aftertaste
i
like
it
for
its
subtle
not
overpowering
taste
feel
is
light
bodied
with
little
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
drinkability
this
was
a
beer
i
grew
to
like
more
and
more
as
i
sipped
my
way
through
it
at
first
i
thought
it
would
be
ok
for
an
occasional
beer
but
as
i
finished
the
beer
i
came
realize
it
is
nicely
drinkable
ill
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
for
a
few
more
before
i
decide
if
id
be
willing
to
drink
it
though
out
an
evening
of
good
food
and
good
conversation
with
friends
however
my
suspicion
at
the
moment
is
that
ill
like
it
better
and
better
the
more
i
have
it
overall
a
solid
beer
this
is
a
beer
ive
passed
up
in
stores
since
well
ever
and
that
may
have
to
change
good
stuff
drinkable
brew
this
was
my
first
bell
beer
and
id
be
interested
in
sampling
some
of
the
other
varietals
whould
i
get
the
opportunity
i
bought
a
6pack
for
the
amazingly
low
price
of
4
the
taste
is
really
growing
on
me
and
each
one
is
getting
better
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
seems
better
in
the
bottle
but
very
similar
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
deep
toffee
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
recedes
rapidly
leaving
minimal
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
primarily
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
with
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
taste
falls
in
line
with
the
nose
many
layers
of
malts
to
it
caramel
toffee
with
some
roasted
malts
mixed
in
here
finish
has
a
bit
of
a
fruity
sweetness
and
bite
to
it
medium
body
low
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
a
chewiness
to
it
easily
a
sessionable
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
really
is
it
is
drinkable
and
has
just
the
right
balance
to
make
this
beer
stand
out
d
pretty
much
what
an
amber
should
be
nothing
crazy
going
on
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
a
good
drinkable
beer
drinks
bigger
than
it
is
i
would
probably
go
for
other
browns
before
this
one
drinkability
very
good
beer
this
is
certainly
something
that
i
could
drink
on
regular
basis
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
above
average
american
amber
ale
and
focuses
more
on
the
malt
profile
than
the
hops
i
find
this
very
drinkable
and
yet
different
than
most
ambers
seems
like
a
spring
or
summer
amber
beer
could
be
a
great
gateway
beer
this
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
hazy
orange
color
not
red
like
i
would
expect
from
an
amber
with
very
visible
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
and
a
decent
white
head
that
caps
well
it
is
warm
out
so
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
but
first
the
smell
actually
a
nice
hop
aroma
on
this
there
is
a
sweet
floral
taste
to
this
leaning
towards
the
end
of
a
ipa
i
enjoy
the
flavor
but
am
not
sure
if
it
is
completely
true
to
the
style
good
brew
for
me
but
might
catch
some
by
surprise
bells
amber
ale
is
a
good
session
beer
as
it
manages
to
stay
drinkable
while
packing
in
a
lot
flavor
a
simply
style
that
is
always
hard
to
rate
for
me
yet
so
easy
to
drink
this
brew
is
one
of
the
better
ambers
that
ive
had
to
date
its
no
cindercone
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
way
to
go
bells
bells
usually
makes
a
good
product
this
is
not
one
of
its
best
this
is
a
recommend
slightly
poured
from
a
bottle
the
head
dissolved
at
a
medium
pace
left
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
looks
are
as
one
would
expect
an
amber
to
appear
nice
orange
glow
unfiltered
with
lots
of
little
particles
hanging
out
doing
their
thing
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
malty
and
low
and
behold
so
is
the
taste
its
malty
sweetness
is
the
first
thing
picked
up
with
little
carbination
with
bits
of
bitterness
bringing
in
the
rear
drinkability
is
smooth
and
easy
going
i
like
it
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
is
a
far
superior
amber
ale
when
compared
to
budweisers
poured
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rustic
redish
amber
with
a
a
bit
of
head
that
leaves
minimal
lace
on
the
glass
smell
has
that
sweet
hoppy
smell
with
a
bit
of
bread
and
clove
this
beer
has
a
taste
of
sweet
bread
with
a
nice
malt
tone
and
some
nice
earth
hop
flavor
in
there
very
well
balanced
and
the
drinkability
is
high
on
this
fine
product
overall
a
regular
that
i
go
to
and
a
nice
session
beer
d
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
ambers
but
this
one
is
a
pretty
drinkable
example
of
one
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
color
one
and
one
half
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hops
slight
fruit
aroma
from
yeast
and
some
brown
sugar
fits
the
style
of
an
american
amber
red
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
hops
and
some
fruity
flavors
overall
a
really
good
blend
of
flavors
and
a
great
drinkability
drinkability
is
good
although
the
bitter
finish
could
get
old
for
some
including
myself
had
this
on
cask
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
perfect
two
finger
head
and
smells
of
roasted
grains
and
caramel
taste
is
so
crisp
and
slightly
malty
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
incredible
and
so
much
better
than
in
bottle
form
this
is
a
session
beer
for
sure
bells
is
no
doubt
an
incredible
craft
brewer
that
the
usa
can
be
proud
of
well
done
drinkability
wasnt
impressed
for
a
brand
ive
been
waiting
for
not
much
of
a
defining
flavor
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
hazy
dark
honeyamber
with
a
thin
but
finebubbled
offwhite
head
appetizing
malty
aroma
has
fruity
and
hoppy
hints
thick
malty
flavor
has
a
hoppy
undertone
and
a
touch
of
banana
texture
is
thick
smooth
and
fizzy
definitely
worth
seeking
pours
a
amber
tinted
brown
or
i
should
say
copper
tinted
red
with
good
carbonation
although
the
head
dies
quick
caramel
malts
on
top
of
floral
hops
textbook
red
ale
smell
a
lighter
bodied
red
the
hops
are
rather
subdued
as
this
beer
passes
smoothly
and
slickly
over
the
tongue
leaving
off
sweet
malt
tastes
as
it
goes
does
caramel
and
roastedtoasted
malts
mostly
along
with
some
other
bitter
sweet
chocolate
vibes
are
balanced
not
evenly
with
citric
hops
and
the
beer
finishes
w
a
crisp
hoppy
backbite
this
is
a
very
good
red
anyone
should
try
but
for
some
reason
it
seemed
a
tad
for
me
coulda
just
been
one
of
those
days
pours
out
hazy
kind
of
golden
definitely
not
amber
in
my
opinion
maybe
copper
at
best
a
massive
head
sits
on
top
and
is
slow
to
collapse
but
still
the
color
is
getting
me
i
want
to
see
more
redamber
colors
the
smell
is
of
biscuit
bread
very
full
a
bit
of
sweetness
great
maltiness
in
this
one
then
there
is
this
orange
smell
with
some
resinous
hops
bitter
citrus
rind
the
taste
really
kind
of
stands
out
there
is
a
really
pleasant
tart
cherry
taste
which
i
like
a
great
maltiness
thick
and
bready
kind
of
a
powdery
dry
bread
like
crackers
then
a
herbal
leafy
finish
of
hops
this
is
a
bit
like
a
soda
but
im
loving
it
the
fruitiness
is
very
nice
i
wish
it
were
just
a
bit
more
beery
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
less
than
impressive
particularly
for
a
style
than
can
be
built
up
to
be
quite
malty
the
carbonation
is
nice
though
an
enjoyable
beer
id
recommend
it
though
id
also
recommend
a
few
improvements
on
this
one
namely
in
color
and
mouthfeel
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
overall
a
fine
beer
worth
trying
but
not
one
i
will
revisit
any
time
soon
it
was
not
particularly
good
or
interesting
drinkability
session
i
love
this
new
bells
beer
were
getting
here
in
sc
drinkability
if
priced
right
this
could
be
a
definite
go
to
beer
tasty
and
refreshingsweet
yet
quenching
and
nice
overall
balance
more
yes
please
perfect
for
a
warm
spring
day
a
very
refreshing
beer
nice
balance
goes
down
way
too
easy
d
superior
to
lots
of
amber
ales
out
there
and
one
id
gladly
enjoy
again
im
pretty
sure
amber
ale
is
bells
flagship
beer
its
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
good
id
prefer
a
little
more
hops
theyd
add
some
zeal
that
it
currently
lacks
other
than
that
the
nose
is
a
tad
weak
and
a
bit
more
body
would
be
good
truth
be
told
those
modifications
might
just
turn
it
into
an
animal
that
its
not
intended
to
be
as
it
is
its
a
nice
session
beer
with
a
pretty
good
flavor
as
easy
as
it
is
to
forget
sometimes
those
have
a
place
in
this
world
d
excellent
stuff
simple
but
extremely
flavorful
and
drinkable
a
solid
beer
without
hitting
any
extremes
worthy
of
having
on
any
occasion
d
nice
clean
and
refreshing
interesting
flavor
with
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
balanced
pretty
well
d
excellent
yearround
offering
from
bellsfor
the
most
part
larry
and
the
crew
can
simply
do
no
wrong
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
little
head
it
is
reddish
orange
in
color
with
some
cloudiness
it
smells
sweet
the
taste
is
surprisingly
nice
citrus
and
malt
it
is
quite
refreshing
after
the
previous
two
ambers
that
i
have
tried
this
weekend
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
d
an
easy
going
amber
ale
that
packs
just
the
slightest
punch
but
is
a
good
choice
for
almost
any
occasion
d
decent
drinkability
but
not
my
favorite
taste
could
be
better
d
another
solid
brew
from
bells
i
really
liked
how
well
rounded
this
beer
was
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amberorange
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
sweet
malty
smell
and
no
discernable
hops
smell
after
drinking
nugget
nectar
and
hopback
within
the
week
i
was
fairly
dissapointed
with
this
one
i
know
bells
has
been
touted
as
having
some
great
beers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
a
great
brew
and
a
great
option
for
a
sessional
moreys
bottom
line
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
for
me
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
but
this
would
have
to
be
the
most
sessionable
one
that
ive
tried
its
really
more
of
an
amberwheat
if
you
ask
me
try
one
and
see
drinkability
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
with
apologies
to
nugget
nectar
i
think
i
may
have
just
found
my
favorite
version
of
this
style
perfectly
drinkable
this
beer
seems
made
for
me
and
may
have
been
my
favorite
from
my
philadelphia
trip
an
awesome
mix
of
malt
and
hops
i
could
easily
session
this
now
if
only
bells
would
ship
to
massachusetts
a
dark
amber
with
huge
chunks
of
particles
flowing
throughout
head
is
initially
strong
but
quickly
dissipates
but
allows
for
nice
lacing
while
drinking
sweet
malts
are
present
in
the
nose
as
well
as
in
the
mouth
nice
mix
between
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hoppyness
at
5
8
abv
its
very
drinkable
and
a
great
year
round

are

best
imbibed
as

than
considered
in

good

expected
probably
slightly
heavier

very
sessionable
this
beer
fits
into
a
particular

that
i
enjoy
on
the
spectrum
of
amber
ales
this
could
almost
lean
towards
that
of
an
oktoberfest
almost
drinkability
excellent
beer
to
have
around
the
house
well
balanced
and
refreshing
probably
a
great
session
beer
from
the
tab
i
get
a
slightly
darker
than
amber
cloudy
beer
with
a
fine
offwhite
creamy

that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
there
is

slightly

i
like

i
will

for
me
bells
amber
ale
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
the
smell
is
of
light
malts
and
nothing
else
the
taste
is
weak
with
some
malt
and
very
little
hops
in
the
mix
this
is
a
beer
that
i
had
high
expectations
for
but
was
let
down
in
the
end
its
drinkable
but
thats
about
it
there
just
aint
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
goin
on
here
i
look
foward
to
trying
some
of
bells
other
offerings
this
amber
ale
will
not
be
purchased
again
fairly
light
bodied
but
not
thin
by
any
means
a
good
drinking
beer
that
i
would
definitely
go
back
to
if
it
was
not

time
a
thank
you
to

try
this

quite
good

and
a
balanced
earthy
flavor
the
color
is
spot
on
for
an
amber
whatever
that
means
but
the
head
dissipated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
in
my
dfh
glass
the
smell
is
bready
and
full
of
caramel
malt
the
flavor
strikes
an
interesting
balance
between
spicy
earthy
hops
and
doughy
sweet
malt
the
feel
is
thicker
and
fuller
than
expected
its
rather
chewy
theres
some
apple
or
raisin
note
in
the
background
bells
amber
ale
is
an
enjoyable
sessionable
and
solid
beer
quick
edit
im
actually
going
to
bump
my
taste
score
up
a
half
notch
the
malt
flavor
is
really
growing
on
me
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
some
good
head
and
nice
lacing
and
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
good
sweet
scent
hints
of
rice
sugar
and
caramal
along
with
a
great
tart
aroma
the
scent
reminds
me
more
of
an
irish
red
than
an
american
red
the
taste
though
is
more
american
though
there
is
a
bit
of
irish
tart
its
mostly
a
great
blend
of
malts
and
hops
sweet
at
first
with
a
nice
hit
of
bitterness
as
you
finish
each
drink
gets
better
with
each
taste
goes
down
very
smooth
if
a
bit
overcarbonated
excellent
beer
d
session
beer
this
one
fits
the
mold
for
me
its
got
enough
taste
to
satisfy
but
a
low
enough
abv
where
your
not
tripping
after
two
cloudy
translucent
orange
with
minimal
white
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
is
floral
perfumy
and
malty
taste
follows
the
nose
reminiscent
of
spring
flowers
with
a
light
spicey
malt
backbone
carbonation
is
present
in
the
body
light
effervescent
and
sweet
a
pleasant
beer
but
nothing
special
drinkability
id
give
it
a
solid
4
on
this
its
not
overwhelming
and
the
lower
abv
makes
it
easy
to
get
through
them
its
not
an
especially
heavy
beer
either
so
i
dont
feel
weighted
down
by
it
bells
was
one
of
the
first
craft
brewers
in
the
u
s
and
the
first
in
the
midwest
at
least
they
claim
to
be
and
this
beer
helped
define
the
american
amber
style
i
think
still
one
of
the
best
like
i
said
i
havent
had
it
in
years
but
having
tasted
it
again
it
will
be
a
staple
from
now
on
truly
exemplary
dthis
would
be
a
great
session
brew
its
smooth
flavor
and
ease
of
drinking
makes
it
so
complexity
isnt
necessarily
high
but
the
quality
of
the
characters
that
this
beer
has
is
good
drinkability
very
high
and
would
pair
well
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
12
oz
bottle
light
red
pour
whitish
head
sweet
malt
some
pine
aromas
malt
and
toffee
flavors
throughout
little
raisin
or
something
green
fruit
nice
bittering
hops
through
the
finish
well
balanced
and
drinkable
but
nothing
outstanding
there
are
some
pale
ale
tones
in
this
one
which
some
will
find
off
putting
one
of
bells
more
sessionable
ales
also
pretty
equal
on
draft
or
bottle
overall
very
good
so
easy
to
drink
sweet
like
candy
my
pint
was
empty
in
less
than
10
minutes
taste
its
just
a
damn
good
amber
ale
bitterness
and
hop
flavors
are
dominant
seems
more
bitter
from
the
bottle
than
when
i
had
it
ontap
i
bought
this
beer
because
i
never
got
to
visit
the
brewery
as
i
had
planned
when
home
in
chicago
over
christmas
i
should
have
assumed
based
on
who
referred
bells
to
me
that
it
would
be
hoppy
ill
be
sure
to
avoid
any
pale
ales
from
that
direction
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
beer
if
offered
again
smells
of
red
licorice
and
a
slight
bit
of
butterscotch
pours
to
a
slightly
red
light
brown
color
with
a
multisized
bubble
head
taste
is
again
some
red
licorice
beer
laces
nicely
on
the
glass
very
well
balanced
ale
great
body
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
taste
is
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
but
both
a
little
more
malty
in
the
front
end
and
slightly
more
bitter
at
the
finish
not
overly
bitter
though
with
malts
coming
through
tarty
at
the
very
end
very
drinkable
tasty
brew
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
amber
full
of
fine
particles
gently
suspended
midbody
a
small
tan
head
to
top
it
off
aromas
are
subtle
but
extremely
good
sweet
drizzly
malts
like
molasses
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
stunningly
good
perfectly
balanced
complex
malts
with
flavors
ranging
from
tropical
fruit
to
toffee
toasty
goodness
backed
by
equally
complex
hops
that
span
the
floral
spectrum
and
with
a
touch
of
oranges
extremely
tasty
medium
body
is
sticky
its
flavors
linger
long
i
could
become
a
evangelist
for
this
brew
exceptionally
good
taste
in
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
pours
a
good
sized
head
and
it
is
lasting
head
color
is
creamy
white
with
small
bubbles
has
a
very
malty
aroma
but
not
too
strong

not
as

pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
shows
some
staying
power
smells
of
caramel
and
dough
mild
citrus

in
the

has
much
of
the

with

nothing
spectacular
but
definitely
drinkable
a
good

ale
this
is
a
balanced
very
tasty
and
drinkable
ale
light
but
full
of
character
with
subtle
complexity
its
caramelly
doughy
and
toasty
with
lightly
toasted
bread
and
light
caramel
malty
sweetness
balanced
with
mostly
citrus
hops
taste
again
brings
the
malt
sweetness
to
the
forefront
sugary
busicuity
maltiness
greets
the
tongue
almost
want
to
say
there
is
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
splashed
in
among
the
caramel
sweetness
and
slightly
toasted
aspects
of
this
beer
as
well
a
soft
estery
hop
profile
lingers
in
the
background
and
only
gives
off
seblances
of
bitterness
the
only
thing
that
really
bugs
me
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tends
to
get
a
little
grainy
near
and
into
the
finish
a
new
sip
is
needed
to
clense
this
away
but
after
each
one
more
and
more
of
this
taste
tends
to
linger
and
brings
down
the
overall
enjoyment
factor
for
me
in
the
end
d
reasonably
quenching
but
not
exciting
not
sure
why
this
is
the
bells
flagship
beer
i
remembered
it
as
the
least
impressive
of
the
mixed
case
i
had
last
year
and
its
setting
itself
up
for
a
repeat
this
year
when
bud
makes
a
beer
like
this
im
impressed
coming
from
bells
its
just
disappointing
date
consumed
10
dec
2008
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
in
the
bottle
and
i
liked
it
even
more
on
tap
very
drinkable
and
quite
sessionable
especially
with
food
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
of
this
style
and
if
i
am
in
the
market
for
an
american
amber
i
would
go
here
overall
impression
i
would
easily
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
nice
beer
when
you
dont
feel
like
blasting
your
mouth
with
hops
yet
want
something
that
is
not
overpoweringly
sweet
it
has
nice
complexity
yet
is
simple
and
refined
at
the
same
time
great
drinkability
very
nice
looking
beer
deep
amber
color
thin
film
of
beige
head
light
lacing
looks
like
some
sort
of
sediment
suspended
thick
in
the
mouth
smells
slightly
earthy
and
sweet
i
now
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
a
six
pack
biscuity
right
up
front
and
backloaded
with
citrus
hops
outstanding
balance
of
soft
brown
sugarsweet
malt
with
a
crisp
controlled
finishing
bitterness
it
was
an
easy
drinking
light
bodied
amber
ale
but
it
was
a
little
too
peppery
for
me
it
would
have
better
if
they
would
have
decreased
the
peppery
flavors
and
increased
the
malts
a
little
bit
just
a
decent
offering
from
a
great
brewery
d
very
drinkable
hoppy
but
not
overdone
with
a
nice
malty
balance
very
sessionable
at
5
5
abv
d
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
and
maybe
try
it
before
having
two
others
will
definitely
get
again
trade
via
brentk56
overall
this
is
a
smooth
and
refreshing
ale
light
in
taste
but
not
watery
or
weak
in
character
i
love
the
way
this
glows
in
my
glasskind
of
a
copper
penny
colorkind
of
a
thin
white

i

my
gosh
is
this
stuff
good
i
could
drink
myself
into
a
stooper
every
night
on
this
stuff
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
with
kind
of
a
sweet
woody
finish
like
candycould
i
have
another
please
thank
you
mr
bell
pretty
sweet
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
not
much
body
to
this
beer
near
the
end
it
started
tasting
really
bland
and
just
bitter
no
sweetness
but
overall
not
a
good
beer
cheers
d
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
it
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
you
will
enjoy
it
the
taste
is
similar
mostly
malty
with
some
hops
to
round
it
out
and
balance
it
nicely
its
caramelly
doughy
and
toasty
with
lightly
toasted
bread
and
light
caramelly
malty
sweetness
balanced
with
mostly
citrusy
hops
that
have
a
light
leafiness
the
citrus
has
a
clear
hint
of
grapefruit
but
this
is
just
barely
prominent
it
also
has
a
light
juiciness
and
hint
of
yeastiness
it
has
a
slightly
creamy
feel
but
a
crisp
finish
it
is
light
but
has
complexity
good
lasting
flavour
nice
balance
and
a
defintie
english
quality
overall
it
is
highly
drinkable
notes
nice
light
amber
true
to
style
and
very
drinkable
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting

i
poured
this
yummy
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
40
degrees
which
was
too
cold
the
beer
was
cloudy
most
likely
cause
it
was
cold
it
was
a
pretty
copper
color
with
a
nice
big
head
the
smell
was
malty
and
of
caramel
and
so
was
its
taste
the
beer
had
great
lacing
and
this
is
another
winner
from
bells
i
will
buy
again
for
sure
a
nice
amber
though
not
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
this
brewerys
beers
aroma
was
all
caramel
malt
pour
was
a
nice
cloudy
amber
with
no
head
taste
was
all
caramel
malt
with
barely
any
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
little
carbonation
bells
makes
some
outstanding
beers
this
is
just
decent
poured
from
the
12oz
bottle
with
an
amber
color
with
maybe
a
tint
of
red
it
is
sweet
smelling
and
the
taste
had
some
nutty
and
caramel
tones
i
really
enjoyed
the
smoothness
of
this
ale
with
a
nice
aftertaste
had
a
couple
more
to
confirm
my
liking
to
this
one
a
friend
from
work
brought
me
this
beer
that
he
bought
in
st
louis
it
isnt
usually
available
in
new
orleans
thanks
dude
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
really
like
md
medium
bodied
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
maltyness
great
brew
to
keep
in
the
fridge
medium
bodied
with
good
drinkability
this
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
craft
beer
good
flavor
but
highly
sessionable
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
amber
in
fact
it
is
my
favorite
amber
i
have
ever
had
not
really
much
to
say
on
this
one
thin
and
weak
dont
make
a
great
amber
ale
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
no
wonder
this
is
bells
flagship
beer
easy
to
have
a
couple
but
probably
no
more
than
that
before
i
wanted
something
else
check
this
one
out
pours
a
foggy
amberbrown
with
a
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
a
good
layer
of
webbing
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
musty
pale
malts
with
a
good
caramel
sweetness
a
faint
pine
hop
tickles
the
nose
with
an
oak
aroma
as
well
creamy
caramel
up
front
on
the
tongue
with
roasted
malts
and
some
nuttiness
midway
grains
and
bread
emerge
with
a
subtle
pine
hop
that
balances
this
out
quite
well
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
a
touch
woody
mosty
smooth
feel
and
light
to
medium
body
with
a
mild
sting
from
the
carbonation
bells
makes
some
of
the
best
beers
out
there
and
this
is
not
to
be
overlooked
a
solid
ale
that
is
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
a
combination
that
id
like
to
experience
more
often
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
we
need
bells
in
ny
nice
carbonation
keeps
the
mouthfeel
full
and
excellent
balance
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
the
most
noticable
scent
is
malt
almost
a
caramelly
sweetness
taste
follows
the
smell
although
not
as
sweet
tasting
as
the
smell
the
hops
balance
the
sweetness
a
bit
better
than
the
smell
suggests
overall
it
is
a
very
very
strong
amber
ale
selection
slight
sweet
hints
of
sweet
carmel
malts
with
hoppy
undertones
very
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
maltiness
was
first
flavor
followed
by
smooth
balancing
hoppiness
finished
smooth
and
was
very
drinkable
a
very
approachable
amber
ale
that
is
neither
too
hoppy
or
too
malty
very
nice
and
balanced
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
from
this
beer
really
the
malts
are
just
light
caramel
and
theres
just
a
slight
spicy
hop
note
in
the
aftertaste
yes
its
very
drinkable
and
not
really
bland
but
its
boring
it
just
sort
of
smells
and
tastes
like
a
generic
amber
ale
theres
nothing
distinguishing
this
stuff
is
really
drinkable
i
only
bought
a
single
but
i
might
have
to
get
a
sixer
sometime
in
the
near
future
bells
is
my
favorite
brewery
and
theyve
definitely
got
a
winner
with
their
flagship
beer
kickass
stuff
this
starts
out
with
sweet
carmal
malt
then
gets
a
tuch
sour
befor
finishing
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
this
one
also
has
a
fair
amount
of
yeast
to
it
that
makes
it
heaverer
and
cloudy
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
drinks
smooth
this
isnt
my
stile
of
choise
but
for
a
stile
i
dont
care
for
this
is
a
deacent
repersation
discovered
at
an
obscure
little
airport
cafe
in
minneapolis
this
brew
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
modest
light
tan
head
and
outstanding
lace
the
aroma
was
mild
roasted
malts
and
peanut
butter
toffee
the
taste
was
crisp
grassy
hops
and
sour
malt
medium
body
melon
hints
and
a
good
peppery
bite
on
the
tongue
not
my
favorite
bells
but
a
good
quality
brew
none
the
less
with
all
bells
beer
they
are
unfiltered
and
every
batch
seems
to
be
slightly
unique
the
website
allowed
me
to
know
that
this
batch
was
bottled
almost
7
months
ago
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
had
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
colored
head
the
color
was
very
awesome
fading
from
a
light
orange
to
an
amber
orange
at
the
top
i
can
definately
taste
that
this
beer
is
almost
a
year
old
and
it
makes
me
sad
that
i
didnt
get
to
enjoy
the
full
potentials
of
bells
the
beer
tasted
very
skunked
so
i
am
going
to
stop
my
review
here
and
when
i
get
a
chance
to
try
an
up
to
date
bottle
then
i
will
write
a
new
review
overall
i
was
once
again
impressed
by
bells
hopefully
theyll
make
their
way
to
ga
soon
until
then
ill
seek
them
out
anytime
i
can
get
my
hands
on
them
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
thin
pale
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
surprisingly
full
not
sure
why
im
surprised
but
i
am
citrus
notes
and
floral
notes
abound
in
the
nose
some
faint
malt
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
agressive
but
pleasing
this
is
really
a
full
flavored
amber
ale
much
tastier
than
i
was
expecting
consistent
with
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
what
i
expect
from
an
amber
ale
and
i
could
drink
these
all
night
d
definitely
sessionable
mild
malt
aroma
light
amber
color
with
a
medium
thin
head
some
lacing
present
smooth
on
the
palate
with
an
easy
finish
good
flavor
kind
of
boring
especially
from
bells
there
was
a
subtle
creamy
sweet
malt
presence
and
the
beer
is
lightly
hopped
nothing
great
about
this
flagship
beer
but
easily
drinkable
and
pleasant
typical
12
ounce
bottle
wo
pours
typical
lighter
amber
clear
light
tan
head
showing
better
then
average
retention
and
then
leaving
decent
frothy
lace
on
the
glass
faint
malty
honey
nose
malty
brew
smooth
and
balanced
middle
of
the
road
style
and
certainly
not
my
favorites
but
this
one
is
better
then
the
rest
balance
is
the
central
theme
fine
sessioner
i
was
surprised
i
hadnt
tried
this
one
from
bells
yet
so
i
picked
up
a
single
and
i
must
say
its
quite
good
its
not
the
best
ever
but
its
very
sessionable
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
i
think
someone
who
is
at
the
beginning
stages
of
the
journey
to
becoming
a
hophead
might
really
enjoy
this
as
its
not
too
bitter
but
does
have
a
certain
kick
to
it
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
smooth
drinks
easy
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
an
average
off
white
head
kinda
rocky
nose
was
malt
hops
and
that
was
about
all
i
could
take
from
it
well
hopped
and
well
balanced
smooth
something
was
different
with
the
malts
caramel
malts
and
maybe
some
english
malts
not
like
most
ambers
i
had
tasted
but
ok
nevertheless
drinkability
clean
and
drinkable
unremarkable
though
still
a
good
choice
for
an
amber
ale
if
youre
looking
for
one
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
lager
which
people
have
rated
lower
but
with
more
of
the
same
different
from
the
masses
i
really
liked
the
lager
and
its
malt
but
did
not
care
for
the
amber
the
amber
is
fuller
and
better
balanced
but
not
special
for
me
i
did
think
it
was
a
good
beer
however
just
not
as
good
as
others
from
bells
maybe
if
it
were
more
red
more
hops
it
would
be
a
winner
for
me
could
drink
these
all
night
long
d
easy
to
drink
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
good
good
beer1
well
made
but
just
a
basic
malty
red
ale
nothing
wrong
with
having
an
approachable
beer
in
your
lineup
but
it
probably
shouldnt
have
gobs
of
yeast
floating
in
it
my
wife
will
enjoy
drinking
the
rest
of
the
6pack
as
this
sort
of
beer
is
right
up
her
alley
d
a
really
well
put
together
amber
it
is
a
rich
and
complex
beer
that
comes
together
nicely
fantastic
amber
ale
poured
a
huge
head
in
my
scooner
and
lasted
till
the
last
drop
aroma
of
flowery
hops
pineapple
and
as
it
warms
brown
sugar
more
on
the
sweet
side
and
could
use
a
bit
more
bittering
hops
when
it
warms
the
flavor
takes
on
a
more
dark
malt
taste
overall
just
awesome
for
the
style
i
will
need
to
revisit
this
beer
again
and
the
aftertaste
i
am
experiencing
right
now
makes
me
with
i
had
another
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
so
i
could
easily
see
this
being
a
session
beer
before
tasting
the
rush
river
amber
i
might
have
said
yeah
its
boring
but
all
ambers
are
turns
out
thats
not
the
case
so
although
this
is
tasty
id
probably
turn
elsewhere
in
the
future
bells
amber
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
brown
color
with
a
monster
of
an
off
white
head
some
visible
sticking
and
slow
rising
carbonation
the
nose
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
i
gather
a
semi
sweet
earthyfruity
nose
with
hints
of
malt
subtleties
nice
toasty
caramel
malty
taste
other
tasting
notes
include
burnt
wood
rust
cherry
apple
and
a
slight
hop
bitternesscitrus
character
the
burnt
maltgrainy
aftertaste
lingers
and
its
probably
its
weakest
point
its
mouth
feel
on
the
other
hand
is
definitely
its
strong
point
perfect
carbonation
with
a
mediumlight
body
i
dunno
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
maybe
a
bad
bottle
maybe
im
just
expecting
more
out
of
this
brewery
i
mean
come
on
hopslam
is
nothing
short
of
a
work
of
art
bells
amber
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
for
its
style
there
are
better
choices
available
in
nj
or
else
where
this
was
my
first
beer
bells
last
night
seeing
as
it
is
their
flagship
beer
i
might
as
well
give
it
a
shot
i
was
impressed
and
delighted
especially
after
i
had
tried
the
amber
ale
from
another
local
brewery
a
few
days
ago
and
i
could
barely
finish
it
this
poured
a
golden
copper
and
had
a
slight
head
the
smell
was
nice
and
hinted
to
a
great
beer
the
flavor
was
complex
yet
refreshing
with
hints
of
many
great
ingredients
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
its
certainly
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
relaxing
on
the
deck
drinking
a
6er
d
i
hate
to
repeat
myself
but
these
are
just
so
crisp
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
as
a
session
beer
really
enjoyable
and
not
too
heavy
more
light
to
medium
bodied
after
further
thought
i
wanted
to
add
that
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
into
the
world
of
craft
beers
taste
is
pale
malty
and
sweet
with
snappy
carbonation
a
tame
minerally
bitterness
and
a
little
caramel
in
the
finish
underwhelming
but
light
and
refreshing
d
superb
very
drinkable
definitely
my
new
favorite
session
beer
during
the
summer
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
this
is
a
straightforward
beer
with
some
good
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
dmouthfeel
of
this
beer
probably
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
however
i
am
not
a
big
enough
fan
of
the
taste
to
turn
this
into
a
session
beer
very
nice
i
would
look
for
it
in
a
pub
this
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
smells
of
sweet
malts
with
some
toffee
tones
tastes
pretty
good
it
has
a
delicate
malty
toastiness
to
it
with
a
bit
of
spicinesspepper
taste
and
followed
by
a
touch
of
hops
this
is
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
i
could
drink
a
few
but
my
need
for
hops
would
make
me
switch
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
frothy
foam
head
with
nice
lacing
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
smells
of
sweet
malt
with
some
citrus
hop
hiding
nicely
in
the
background
taste
is
smooth
sweet
malt
with
some
toasty
grain
and
excellent
hop
balance
perfectly
carbonated
and
crisp
with
sweet
malt
and
nice
mellow
hop
balance
very
nice
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
great
very
nice
amber
probably
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
ever
had
i
could
drink
several
of
these
the
cool
thing
is
i
took
a
chance
with
these
and
bought
a
whole
6pack
because
they
were
bottle
conditioned
i
figured
there
was
a
chance
they
could
be
decent
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
love
it
when
this
happens
like
i
said
probably
the
best
amber
i
have
ever
had
5
more
to
go
cheers
a
delicious
copper
colored
ale
with
a
hearty
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
as
water
nice
aftertaste
and
no
carbonation
gives
an
enjoyable
experience
from
the
moment
it
hits
your
tongue
to
the
moment
it
hits
your
stomach
highly
recommended
i
will
be
buying
this
ale
again
pours
a
murky
amber
in
color
medium
head
with
spots
of
lacing
smell
is
good
and
balanced
but
all
i
think
is
buttered
bread
and
toasted
caramel
some
grain
and
light
hops
very
delicate
and
balanced
taste
a
brief
hint
of
bitterness
up
front
but
this
is
more
of
a
malted
amber
toasted
bread
and
light
grain
with
some
sweetness
good
earthy
light
citrus
hops
smooth
lightly
crisp
but
almost
doughy
mouthfeel
carbonation
level
keeps
it
from
becoming
creamy
or
full
the
hops
keep
this
brew
in
check
but
malt
flavor
is
the
winner
very
drinkable
session
amber
a
vacation
from
the
hopped
up
trend
of
ambers
that
seems
to
be
going
on
i
like
it
the
aroma
is
nice
sweet
with
a
faint
hoppy
smell
i
detect
some
small
pepper
aroma
and
also
citrus
orange
the
taste
is
very
good
well
blended
malts
and
hops
the
hops
come
into
play
at
the
tail
end
but
are
well
received
the
flavor
also
has
a
little
pepper
kick
to
it
the
mf
is
medium
bodied
and
very
flavorful
very
good
dpretty
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
this
may
be
the
best
american
amber
ive
hadusually
a
boring
style
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
wish
i
had
bought
a
few
more
all
around
good
amber
ale
i
would
definitely
revisit
this
one
in
the
future

the
samea
pretty
strong

of
mine
raves
about
it

excellent
i

a

ive
had
bad
luck
with
this
style
before
theyre
either
too
sweet

too
bland
or
too
something
but
this
one
is
excellently
balanced
very
robust
and
very
drinkable
check
it
out
drinkablility
is
great
this
is
a
rich
and
complex
brew
that
has
an
excellent
profile
and
a
mellow
finish
the
flavors
work
well
to
create
a
complete
profile
with
a
smoothness
that
makes
it
finish
easy
cheers
taste
is
a
bit
weak
in
the
inital
mouthful
but
has
a
nice
finish
that
stays
with
you
with
a
hoppy
finish
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
nessasarly
drink
all
the
time
but
not
a
bad
amber
as
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
fairly
drinkable
in
that
its
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
flavor
and
not
the
best
ive
had
but
just
sticks
solidly
to
the

not
a

ale
pretty
tasty
and
sessionable
at
that

its
rather
enjoyable
and
im
sure
it
goes
great
in
the
summer
on
a
hot
day
or
in
the
spring
on
a
mild
day
take
your
pick
recommended
a
nice
amber
ale
that
could
be
easily
overlooked
in
the
shadows
cast
by
its
bigger
and
darker
brothers
interesting
enough
and
dry
enough
in
the
finish
to
make
me
want
more
i
would
happily
session
this
one
and
i
could
see
it
being
a
very
versatile
beer
with
meals
its
a
pity
this
isnt
available
in
massachusetts
i
always
savor
my
visits
home
so
i
can
enjoy
the
offerings
of
this
great
brewery
d
it
seems
like
many
amber
ales
are
watery
bland
beers
that
primarily
exist
to
offer
bmc
drinkers
their
first
taste
of
craft
this
is
not
a
typical
amber
ale
this
is
a
more
worthy
amber
ale
that
offers
an
above
average
hop
profile
and
a
pretty
damn
tasty
session
beer
drinkability
hech
yeah
have
these
all
day
long
this
one
is
all
about
sessionable
goodness
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
while
this
was
a
noisy
beer
on
the
pour
the
carbonation
is
subdued
i
rate
the
drinkability
high

to
the
wonderful

pleasant

flavors
with
a

poking

nice

amber
although
not
too
spectacular
overall
overall
impression
wow
nice
amber
great
flavors
in
moderation
and
balance
let
both
the
hop
and
malt
characteristics
shine
i
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
bells
yet
pretty
good
its
kind
of
reminiscent
of
an
oktoberfest
in
the
malt
profile
d
i
would
have
another
of
these
in
a
heartbeat
theres
not
much
more
that
could
be
done
to
make
this
any
easier
for
me
to
drink
moutfeel
is
very
light
and
carbonated
nothing
much
to
notice
same
with
the
drinkability
rereviewed
21908
after
an
especially
enjoyable
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
slight
head
due
to
a
chilled
glass
damnit
that
left
slight
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
one
thing
that
caught
my
attention
in
a
positive
way
was
the
amount
of
suspended
yeast
in
it
while
its
not
consistent
with
the
style
i
find
it
a
sexy
attribute
in
a
beer
i
love
me
some
suspended
yeast
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
caramel
malts
but
there
is
also
a
roasted
smell
to
it
along
with
some
molasses
taste
is
sweet
but
dry
my
biggest
issue
with
it
is
it
has
an
almost
saccharine
quality
to
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
i
still
find
to
this
to
be
on
par
with
the
rest
of
bells
lineup
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
amber
ale
not
the
prettiest
amber
ale
but
very
tasty
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
i
agree
w
the
other
reviews
stating
that
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
this
was
a
disappointng
beer
i
especially
enjoy
bells
twohearted
ale
but
this
one
did
not
agree
with
me
nearly
as
well
it
arrived
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
for
an
amber
ale
the
taste
was
of
sourish
malts
and
bitter
hops
but
they
didnt
seem
to
balance
or
mix
very
well
it
was
a
bit
of
a
lopsided
brew
decent
but
not
extraordinary
maybe
its
better
out
of
the
bottle
drinkability
a
pleasurable
and
sessionable
amber
offering
from
bells
i
love
the
unfiltered
look
which
i
think
adds
a
lot
with
all
the
floaties
though
i
think
that
could
turn
some
people
off
mfd
lasting
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
and
extremely
smooth
very
drinkable
crisp
and
clean
with
an
awesome
aftertaste
that
left
me
craving
more
which
i
guess
would
make
it
a
great
session
beer
i
really
like
this
one
if
you
are
serving
this
to
a
squeamish
friend
beware
of
the
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
made
no
difference
to
me
whatsoever
but
there
was
no
mention
on
the
label
or
i
would
have
poured
more
carefully
beautiful
ale
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
had
and
an
overall
top
10
sessionable
affordable
and
great
tasting
just
what
i
like
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
here
from
bells
i
had
not
really
had
much
experience
with
their
regular
lineup
tending
to
stick
more
with
the
bigger
seasonal
offerings
but
this
may
have
changed
my
mine
really
showing
what
they
can
pull
off
on
a
more
mass
produced
level
this
was
very
good
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
try
it
again
on
any
condition
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
malt
sweetness
and
some
yeastiness
the
taste
was
great
had
a
nice
sweetness
and
hint
of
roasted
malts
probably
the
best
amber
ive
ever
had
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
d
a
decent
malt
bill
with
good
drinkability
making
for
a
good
session
beer
it
feels
a
lot
like
a
well
carbonated
wheat
beer
finishes
crisp
due
to
carbonation
and
leaves
a
citrus
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
overall
i
will
have
to
say
that
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
not
the
favorite
of
this
style
so
far
very
drinkable
and
just
all
around
good
from
what
i
have
seen
bells
really
lives
up
to
their
reputation
i
wish
we
could
get
it
here
in
ga
but
maybe
one
day
thanks
to
my
buddy
aaron
for
snagging
a
few
of
these
from
his
wife
to
share
with
me
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
sessionable
ale
that
i
will
be
purchasing
again
this
is
precisely
why
bells
is
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
the
u
s
they
excel
with
their
more
sessionable
beers
as
they
do
the
highabv
monsters
long
may
they
brew
d
decent
overall
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
bells
worth
a
try
pours
a
pretty
clouded
orangeish
brown
amber
slight
leafy
nose
seems
very
calm
though
the
flavor
really
brings
it
here
even
and
firm
bodied
consistently
earthy
woody
tones
feel
is
very
well
bodied
on
the
liquid
and
a
good
carbonation
as
well
im
calling
this
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
an
overall
good
brew
to
try
this
one
is
okay
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
id
rather
drink
orange
amber
in
color
with
an
abundance
of
fine
bubbles
orangish
off
white
head
is
retained
to
almost
the
end
good
lacing
plenty
of
hop
presence
aroma
is
kind
of
agricultural
taste
is
dry
and
clean
any
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
overshadowed
by
dry
bitterness
making
it
an
excellent
choice
to
accompany
food
feels
like
carbonated
mineral
water
in
the
mouth
a
good
solid
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
body
is
a
hazy
glowing
orange
amber
in
color
hosts
a
light
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
nose
is
mildly
vibrant
with
spicey
wheat
and
hints
of
nuts
and
orange
marmalade
enters
the
mouth
softly
tart
sweet
width
tones
of
toasty
wheat
a
mineral
hoppy
feel
greats
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
subdued
malty
nut
feel
also
develops
twords
the
end
of
the
palate
creating
a
even
but
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
just
the
right
amoutn
of
complexity
for
a
amber
ale
very
drinkable
a
touch
overcarbonated
although
thinking
back
to
the
head
im
wondering
if
i
should
have
poured
harder
the
body
is
full
but
never
heavy
this
has
been
and
in
my
mind
still
is
one
of
the
reasons
this
style
exists
an
often
overdone
underwhelming
beer
that
is
taken
to
new
heights
here
sessionable
in
every
way
and
a
midwestern
classic
d
i
like
this
a
lot
very
flavorful
and
great
mouthfeel
but
not
too
overpowering
definitely
would
have
this
again
dability
a
nice
american
ale
with
some
rich
maltiness
to
balance
out
the
hops
45
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
i
would
drink
more
d
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
out
there
this
stuff
is
thirst
quenching
and
relatively
light
but
provides
enough
complexity
and
depth
of
character
to
keep
a
beer
lover
interested
a
very
fine
choice
for
a
session
brew
overall
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
from
the
bottle
or
a
regular
tap
and
thought
it
was
pretty
decent
however
its
a
whole
different
experience
from
the
cask
it
really
seemed
to
up
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
drinkability
nice
and
refreshing
nice
session
beer
another
solid
outing
by
bells
pours
a
cloudy
gloden
orange
with
a
good
two
finger
head
head
retention
is
better
than
normal
with
moderate
lace
left
behind
smell
was
not
too
impressive
smells
of
malt
and
grain
but
i
also
detect
an
almost
yeast
like
smell
similar
to
a
belgian
taste
is
better
a
nice
malt
profile
and
noticable
grain
presence
no
real
hop
bitterness
to
this
as
expected
moderate
carbonation
leaves
a
crisp
and
clean
feeling
with
a
slightly
dry
aftertaste
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
admit
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
but
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tasted
yet
drinkability
this
is
a
staple
beer
for
me
and
never
disappoints
solid
all
around
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
murky
dark
gold
amber
with
a
nice
sized
head
aroma
is
sweet
with
herbal
and
floral
hops
some
citrus
notes
tastes
caramelly
and
sweet
lots
of
herbal
hops
balanced
and
flavorful
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
solid
amber
overall
this
is
an
amber
you
could
drink
gallons
of
and
not
get
tired
of
it
some
nice
biscuity
flavors
going
on
here
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
remarkable
smell
predictable
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
carbonation
i
will
definitely
have
to
revisit
this
one
again
not
a
bad
effort
by
bells
though
ill
definitely
be
coming
back
to
this
beer
after
as
i
really
enjoyed
it
great
job
bells
great
job
visiting
my
brother
in
nc
he
bought
this
to
try
thanks
d
beautiful
deep
orange
deep
orange
color
with
decent
head
that
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
down
balanced
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
very
pleasant
spicy
hops
scent
so
far
looks
and
smells
like
a
pale
ale
taste
was
nicely
balanced
good
mouthfeel
with
moderate
to
a
bit
more
carbonation
pale
alelike
hops
taste
at
first
mellowing
to
balanced
hopsmalt
and
spicy
aftertaste
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
what
a
wonderful
surprise
the
smell
was
feintly
of
pear
or
fresh
plum
but
not
very
strong
the
taste
was
of
citrus
yeast
all
spice
mild
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
well
rounded
bitter
taste
and
finish
very
tasty
i
could
go
for
another
of
these
its
a
very
complete
and
satisfying
sample
of
the
style
from
bells
thanks
again
merchants
in
dearborn
drinkability
pretty
good
definitely
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
ive
drinken
overall
a
pretty
solid
amber
ale
i
enjoyed
the
mixture
of
maltshops
that
went
into
this

from

recommended
drinkability
a
nicely
done
wellbalanced
amber
ale
in
fact
ive
found
the
bulk
of
the
bells
lineup
from
top
to
bottom
to
be
quite
solid
drinks
pretty
good
just
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
initial
taste
up
front
not
a
bad
amber
though
just
not
a
great
one
a
dark
shade
of
amber
with
a
dense
creamy
off
white
one
finger
head
and
super
retention
leaving
lacing
to
the
bottom
the
nose
is
faint
with
notes
of
candied
sugar
nutty
malt
and
a
light
fruit
scent
a
remarkably
smooth
mouthfeel
thats
even
creamy
slightly
chewy
and
just
enough
carbonation
to
develop
a
fizzy
build
at
the
end
flavors
of
toasted
grains
bready
caramel
mild
tartness
midway
through
and
a
flash
of
spiciness
just
before
it
goes
down
the
finish
is
semidry
with
much
of
the
roasted
malt
residual
and
nuttiness
really
a
great
alternative
for
fat
tire
lovers
i
am
not
a
lover
of
ft
but
this
beer
has
a
touch
of
the
biscuit
taste
everyone
digs
less
the
hops
another
solid
beer
from
bells
great
head
good
flavors
touch
of
spruce
not
the
least
bit
heavy
good
score
from
across
the
border
cant
wait
to
hoard
it
bells
amber
ale
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
bottle
there
is
a
mild
malty
aroma
the
flavor
is
superbly
well
balanced
toasted
malt
is
evenly
matched
with
hops
the
malt
is
more
prevalent
in
the
finish
leaving
a
caramel
flavor
they
call
this
the
flagship
of
their
line
and
for
good
reason
this
is
an
excellent
highly
sessionable
beer
recommended
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
though
i
still
like
this
brewerys
two
hearted
ale
more
but
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
that
i
would
love
to
try
on
tap
someday
a
delicious
copper
colored
ale
with
a
hearty
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
as
water
nice
aftertaste
and
no
carbonation
gives
an
enjoyable
experience
from
the
moment
it
hits
your
tongue
to
the
moment
it
hits
your
stomach
highly
recommended
i
will
be
buying
this
ale
again
pours
a
burnt
orange
cloudy
mixture
with
some
bubbly
head
that
never
really
amounts
to
much
maybe
its
because
i
had
a
batch
8000
before
this
but
i
smell
the
spices
of
coriander
and
ginger
as
well
as
some
pepper
taste
is
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
with
some
copper
type
of
taste
that
is
smoothed
over
by
sweet
malt
another
great
offering
from
bells
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
drinkability
excellent
example
of
the
style
full
of
flavour
and
wellbalanced
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
ive
certainly
had
better
amber
ales
from
dogfish
head
and
three
floyds
but
when
you
are
in
michigan
and
its
3
a
pint
hell
give
me
five
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
toasted
fruity
malt
and
some
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
a
dry
toasty
malt
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
amber
that
is
recommended
pours
an
unfiltered
hazy
orangish
copper
color
solid
offwhite
head
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
pleasant
with
some
toffee
butterscotch
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
toasted
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
with
more
of
the
citrus
and
malty
sweetness
noted
in
the
aroma
hops
are
a
bit
spicy
medium
bodied
and
an
easy
drinker
you
can
see
why
this
is
their
flagship
beer
nothing
too
extreme
and
wellbalanced
leading
to
a
beer
that
can
be
used
to
convert
the
bmcs
a
solid
amber
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
taste
offers
an
impeccable
balance
between
creamy
smooth
malt
and
a
refined
bitter
finish
really
harmonious
and
makes
for
a
great
soft
session
beer
not
nearly
as
fullflavored
as
many
other
stellar
bells
beers
but
this
a
a
robust
and
highly
drinkable
american
amber
ale
m
d
wellcarbonated
and
perfect
for
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
crisp
with
a
great
body
again
balance
is
the
key
and
its
done
so
well
here
for
being
a
brewery
thats
mostly
known
for
its
stouts
this
amber
has
sure
proven
its
worth
amongst
the
bells
fold
this
one
is
definitely
a
musthave
for
amber
fans
and
the
flavor
will
definitely
allow
you
to
drink
your
fill
very
bland
beer
the
smell
which
should
first
draw
you
in
is
weak
and
the
taste
just
does
not
fit
it
is
almost
flat
to
taste
i
was
very
disappointed
it
does
have
a
good
color
and
it
may
be
better
in
draft
form
i
am
waiting
to
try
other
beers
in
the
bell
brewery
family
d
i
first
snagged
one
of
these
from
a
friend
whos
first
beer
choice
is
shiner
bock
i
wasnt
expecting
a
bad
beer
but
needless
to
say
i
wasnt
expecting
something
this
good
well
rounded
and
ballsy
with
the
hops
a
nice
surprise
hope
to
have
it
one
on
tap
one
day
pours
a
nice
amber
color
a
touch
hazy
with
a
quality
finger
of
white
head
on
top
that
disappears
fairly
slowly
nose
is
strong
on
toffee
malt
maybe
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
and
some
light
hops
as
well
malt
dominates
though
taste
is
similar
mostly
caramel
malt
comes
through
throughout
the
drink
a
little
stronger
hop
presence
than
in
the
nose
some
comes
through
especially
lightly
up
front
and
in
the
fairly
brief
aftertaste
but
this
one
is
definitely
a
malt
beer
i
like
this
one
its
definitely
not
the
flavor
explosion
that
a
lot
of
bells
beers
are
but
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
any
occasion
pours
a
thick
and
hazy
brown
in
color
fairly
dense
white
head
that
evaporated
down
to
a
scuzzy
layer
malty
nose
with
a
slight
evergreen
whiff
to
it
flavor
is
a
nice
solid
malt
backbone
kind
of
an
oakiness
to
it
as
well
hops
give
a
slight
sprice
and
evergreen
flavor
too
medium
to
almost
full
mouthfeel
odd
for
the
setyle
but
i
am
really
digging
it
nice
almostsession
beer
d
nothing
in
this
beer
really
stands
out
even
though
it
is
a
solid
beer
a
good
example
of
an
amber
ale
but
not
one
to
write
home
about
would
make
a
good
session
beer
though
thanks
to
dekker0
for
including
it
in
our
trade
really
tasty
amber
ale
i
like
the
hop
punch
bells
strikes
again
bham
uk
overall
this
was
a
great
amber
some
of
that
unique
bells
flavor
is
there
the
yeast
i
think
balanced
on
the
malt
with
a
good
afront
oh
hops
and
yeast
bitterness
pours
an
orangy
light
amber
color
with
a
fairly
large
off
white
head
the
head
slowly
shrinks
down
to
a
covering
of
the
glass
lacing
is
minimal
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
well
balanced
ale
primarily
malty
and
very
smooth
there
is
also
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
interesting
and
keep
the
sweetness
down
to
a
manageable
level
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
fine
i
had
it
with
a
barbequed
ribs
chicken
dinner
and
it
held
up
fine
would
be
a
great
regular
beer
or
part
of
a
regular
rotation
as
well
as
a
good
session
beer
the
pour
into
my
fullers
nonic
raises
a
light
tan
stable
but
short
head
the
lacing
it
leaves
is
sparse
and
slick
but
clings
a
bit
the
body
is
a
very
hazy
golden
copper
with
a
significant
amount
of
sediment
floating
about
i
wonder
why
thats
in
a
beer
like
this
but
im
sure
it
helps
the
flavor
and
maybe
its
even
bottle
conditioned
the
nose
is
very
maltysweet
with
a
toasted
bit
to
it
as
well
i
pick
up
mellow
citrus
notes
too
the
beer
has
a
nice
taste
balance
with
the
hops
leading
at
first
but
again
mellow
it
finishes
with
a
relaxed
toastiness
that
invites
another
taste
a
bit
too
acidic
though
the
mouth
is
medium
with
too
much
carbonation
despite
being
very
fine
overall
its
not
hard
to
drink
but
too
many
faults
make
me
regret
that
i
bought
a
whole
case
an
allaround
solid
beer
from
bells
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
decent
creamy
head
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
bock
than
an
american
amberred
due
to
the
maltsweet
balance
of
it
dough
and
toffee
in
the
nose
along
with
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
flowers
sweet
caramel
malts
upfront
with
just
barely
enough
hops
to
round
it
out
before
the
sweetness
comes
returns
on
the
back
end
medium
carbonation
from
the
bottle
conditioning
nice
and
creamycrisp
at
the
same
time
almost
medium
in
body
a
nice
session
beer
but
for
that
i
would
prefer
a
pride
and
joy
sweetness
can
make
this
a
little
cloying
after
a
while
oelergud
d
surprisingly
drinkable
great
example
of
the
style
a
beautifully
balanced
amber
ale
with
subltle
hops
and
a
clean
finish
most
definitely
something
you
may
want
to
session
in
my
opinion
overall
an
amber
ale
that
is
up
front
about
what
it
is
a
good
beer
for
when
youre
not
in
a
heavybeer
mood
i
guess
bells
is
big
on
bottle
conditioning
i
dont
think
i
am
a
fan
for
that
in
this
type
of
beer
the
bottle
poured
with
a
cloudy
amber
color
head
was
good
and
lasted
most
of
the
way
the
hops
were
notable
but
nothing
over
the
top
taste
was
good
and
very
fresh
but
the
yeasty
notes
just
dont
need
to
be
there
i
really
think
this
might
be
a
better
beer
if
it
were
not
bottled
conditoned
worth
a
try
but
i
think
it
could
be
better
pours
a
hazy
amber
off
white
head
forms
goes
pretty
fast
leaves
a
few
lace
spots
smell
is
sweet
vegetal
citrus
some
bread
nothing
special
bit
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
sweet
some
caramel
yeast
bread
very
light
floral
in
the
finish
light
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
drinkable
but
a
good
example
of
mediocrity
maybe
past
its
prime
a
bit
thanks

a
solid
representation
of
the
style
from
a
top
notch
brewery
a
good
value
session
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
good
a
better
version
of
your
average
amber
ale
im
not
really
a
fan
of
these
types
of
beers
but
its
good
none
the
less
i
would
have
again
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
my
adnams
tulip
pint
glass
appears
a
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
an
inch
of
off
white
foam
that
leaves
a
decent
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
malt
with
a
crisp
fruity
note
initial
taste
is
of
sweet
lightly
toasted
malt
followed
by
fruity
flowery
hops
very
close
to
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
nice
sessionable
amber
pours
a
cloudy
orangeish
colour
not
much
head
stays
but
could
be
easily
called
back
with
even
light
swirling
spots
of
lacing
left
behind
a
very
musty
aroma
lightly
roasted
caramel
malts
mostly
smells
certainly
closer
to
a
pale
ale
musty
and
unappealing
not
much
flavour
either
some
nice
malts
but
hints
of
diacetyl
perhaps
i
expect
more
from
bells
given
their
excellent
lineup
of
offerings
or
perhaps
just
the
limitations
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
just
painfully
average
at
best
thanks

d
very
drinkable
so
smooth
and
subtle
you
dont
even
realize
you
just
finished
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
looks
very
cloudy
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
with
a
nice
finger
or
so
of
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
smell
is
slightly
floral
with
some
roasted
character
and
maybe
even
a
little
sour
apple
fruitiness
the
taste
is
very
nice
malty
up
front
with
a
generous
hop
backbone
there
is
an
mingling
of
sweet
and
sour
as
well
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
excellent
for
this
style
very
easy
to
drinksession
good
stuff
recommended
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
murky
amber
duh
with
a
twinge
of
particulate
floating
around
a
decent
beginning
head
that
recedes
quickly
to
a
thin
foam
and
pretty
decent
lacing
aroma
is
malty
toasted
and
caramels
faint
herbal
hops
taste
is
also
more
malty
biscuts
bready
and
faintly
herbal
hops
a
little
earthy
caramel
is
gone
fruits
now
a
twinge
tart
the
mouth
is
not
good
thinnish
and
too
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
too
dry
and
there
is
straw
in
the
finish
and
i
dont
like
it
overall
a
decent
beer
not
bells
best
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
could
drink
large
quantities
of
this
with
ease
and
would
do
so
if
i
could
find
them
more
regularly
overall
an
impressive
beer
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
id
consider
a
flagship
beer
never
the
less
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
in
this
style
batch
7779
had
this
one
right
after
the
bells
pale
at
flying
saucer
and
reviewed
from
notes
this
is
one
of
the
palest
ambers
i
have
ever
had
not
much
redder
than
the
pale
ale
the
head
was
rather
thin
and
diminished
quickly
leaving
a
small
amount
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malts
and
some
very
subdued
hops
at
least
is
was
more
noticeable
than
the
pale
the
taste
was
a
good
balance
of
caramel
malts
and
subtle
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
had
a
slight
alcohol
bite
more
than
i
would
expect
for
a
5
5
beer
decent
carbonation
this
would
perhaps
make
a
good
nightcap
but
it
is
not
really
something
i
would
buy
regularly
d
i
can
drink
this
often
very
wellcrafted
beer
its
solid
and
nearly
flawless
except
for
the
mouthfeel
but
its
a
bit
watery
and
unremarkable
still
its
very
drinkable
with
clean
easygoing
flavors
which
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
recommended
but
just
barely
7
99
6pack
broad
refreshing
flavor
with
copious
but
unoffending
biitterness
from
a
surprisingly
robust
hop
presence
and
a
medium
malt
profile
a
little
metallic
and
tinny
tasting
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
could
stand
to
be
a
little
thicker
but
this
still
is
a
fairly
solid
amber
ale
though
the
hoppiness
almost
makes
you
think
its
a
pale
ale
with
highly
drinkable
qualities
although
maybe
moreso
in
summer
than
in
winter
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
a
bit
of
very
fine
sedimet
is
floating
around
bubbly
white
head
about
two
fingers
worth
smells
of
faint
hops
and
sweet
malt
very
refreshing
smelling
it
makes
me
want
to
take
a
huge
gulp
as
the
first
taste
fairly
sweet
malt
flavor
with
well
balanced
hop
flavor
very
little
bitterness
it
seems
like
the
sweetness
might
be
sticky
but
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
seems
to
scrub
it
clean
excellent
smooth
but
crisp
mouthfeel
you
can
easily
drink
three
or
four
of
these
after
drinking
so
many
stouts
and
ipas
this
winter
this
has
been
an
awesome
change
a
perfect
example
of
a
simple
beer
that
can
please
any
craft
beer
enthusiast
i
finished
this
and
thought
this
is
a
decent
but
different
amber
ale
good
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
maybe
fresher
but
i
cant
agree
with
my
friend
it
doesnt
blow
my
socks
off
a
good
one
for
getting
again
certainly
sessionable
pours
a
beautiful
orange
amber
with
alittle
haze
a
short
head
and
pretty
good
lacing
the
residual
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
nose
has
some
cereal
grains
up
front
and
some
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
balanced
and
very
nice
creamy
and
spicy
with
mild
but
noticeable
hops
and
some
fruit
on
the
finish
nice
balanced
mouthfeel
and
quite
a
session
beer
good
solid
standard
notes
first
good
amber
ive
had
i
would
buy
this
again
hands
down
no
questions
asked
d
a
really
great
session
brew
heed
the
carbonation
and
sip
dont
chug
but
as
the
carbonation
settles
more
and
more
you
can
chug
more
and
more
i
am
not
really
recommending
chuging
though
even
if
it
is
good
enough
for
me
to
want
to
take
the
time
to
enjoy
it
12
ounce
bottle
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
batch
id
on
the
back
label
that
when
entered
on
the
website
tells
you
when
it
was
packaged
the
odd
thing
is
that
the
batch
id
indicated
that
this
was
the
winter
white
and
not
the
amber
though
was
a
hazy
copper
color
had
a
decent
head
that
quickly
dissipated
but
left
some
lacing
throughout
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
more
creamy
than
i
expected
for
an
amber
so
a
good
surprise
the
aroma
was
average
not
really
strong
in
any
area
but
had
sweet
malt
to
it
for
the
style
though
you
dont
really
expect
a
strong
aroma
though
so
met
expectations
the
taste
was
excellent
started
strong
and
finished
strong
again
since
an
amber
there
was
no
overriding
theme
just
a
solid
great
taste
this
could
easily
be
my
session
beer
if
available
where
i
lived
which
sadly
it
isnt
strongly
recommend
4
hr
t
y
might
be
a
little
too
oily
sweet
for
my
personal
preferences
to
make
me
a
regular
buyer
but
its
still
a
quality
amber
another
shining
brew
to
bells
repertoire
i
would
snag
this
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
the
style
bells
amber
would
go
quite
well
on
a
warm
summer
day
as
it
is
definately
a
thirst
quencing
and
refreshing
offering
of
this
style
however
while
it
wasnt
bad
it
definately
left
something
to
be
desired
the
drinkability
is
good
pound
a
few
no
problemo
prosit
mk
batch
7748
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
creamy
that
much
became
evident
when
i
burped
and
some
of
the
beer
came
up
with
the
burpvery
creamy
carbonation
is
subtle
and
is
not
really
noticed
unless
specifically
focusing
on
that
aspect
of
the
beer
it
does
not
interfere
with
this
beers
flavor
profile
and
actually
accents
the
malt
characteristics
of
this
beers
flavor
does
not
have
a
dry
finish
and
goes
down
quite
easily
i
probably
wont
buy
this
beer
againin
the
near
future
just
because
there
are
so
many
other
interpretations
of
this
style
i
am
also
not
a
big
fan
of
banana
and
clove
phenols
in
an
american
style
12
oz
bottle
batch
7713
which
according
to
the
website
was
packaged
on
11106
sampled
on
1129
so
it
doesnt
get
much
fresher
than
this
it
pours
an
unfiltered
caramelamber
with
high
carbonation
and
a
voluminous
head
that
is
craggy
as
it
recedes
leaving
good
lacing
it
smells
of
juicy
fruits
mainly
white
grapefruit
along
with
some
sweetness
but
its
a
bit
light
on
the
palate
there
are
pale
and
carameltoasted
malts
grapefruit
mango
pineapple
oilyperfumy
pine
and
possible
curacao
hops
along
with
a
touch
of
yeast
the
caramel
quality
really
strengthens
as
it
warms
it
is
tingly
yet
medium
and
smooth
on
the
palate
leaving
a
medium
finish
but
thinning
a
bit
as
i
progress
overall
a
pretty
good
amber
that
would
make
for
a
good
session
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
murky
golden
amber
color
with
a
slightly
carbonated
head
smell
is
of
amber
and
caramel
malts
sweet
taste
is
initially
sweet
followed
by
a
nice
balance
of
hops
that
finishes
dry
beer
is
medium
bodied
chewy
with
creamy
carbonation
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
to
me
as
anything
too
special
at
first
sip
there
were
some
lightly
caramalized
malts
and
a
nice
fresh
yeasty
aroma
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
had
become
just
another
decent
amber
ale
in
a
sea
of
amber
ales
designed
to
be
friendly
and
approachable
to
those
who
are
new
to
craft
beer
nothing
wrong
with
that
but
i
can
save
a
buck
and
support
my
local
brewer
to
boot
by
drinking
regular
dominion
ale
which
is
more
of
a
british
pale
ale
but
has
more
character
so
yeah
um
ill
just
go
an
do
that
i
guess
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
a
glass
beer
mug
it
pours
a
pleasing
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
its
smell
like
its
taste
is
malty
and
slightly
bitter
there
are
some
solid
citrus
undertones
easy
drinking
light
to
moderate
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
cross
over
beer
for
a
macro
drinker
that
like
killians
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
layer
of
head
and
is
moderately
carbonated
the
aroma
is
a
little
piney
and
possibly
some
floral
notes
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
is
rather
malty
it
is
easy
on
palate
even
though
it
is
quite
bitter
this
beer
could
use
a
litter
better
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
but
is
still
a
good
beer
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
out
of
out
a
glass
and
it
is
much
better
having
this
one
out
of
a
bottle
definitely
doesnt
do
it
justice
higher
and
lighter
in
the
mouth
than
some
other
amber
ales
that
ive
had
very
drinkable
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
fun
introduction
to
bells
which
has
up
to
now
not
been
available
here
in
virginia
the
pour
is
an
attractive
copper
gold
with
a
short
lived
white
head
very
little
lacing
with
this
one
aroma
is
light
malt
with
detectable
flowery
hop
notes
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
light
malt
and
light
toasted
grains
the
finishes
has
a
nice
bitter
hops
taste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
decent
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
light
body
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
well
crafted
amber
ale
nothing
that
makes
it
a
standout
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
nice
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
very
crisp
with
a
biscuity
malt
and
flowery
hops
finish
i
could
and
probably
will
session
on
this
beer
drinkability
this
is
where
the
beer
scores
best
somewhat
complex
upfront
and
clean
in
the
finish
makes
for
a
great
drinking
beer
the
lower
abv
helps
but
is
perfect
for
this
beer
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
great
one
d
the
slight
sweetness
makes
for
a
good
drinkability
here
cheers
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
but
only
because
of
all
the
other
great
choices
from
bells
d
nothing
spectacular
drinkable
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
overall
a
great
amber
that
is
very
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
grab
a
six
pack
and
enjoy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
cloudy
copper
color
with
nice
white
head
very
surprised
to
find
little
if
any
smell
at
all
a
touch
of
citrus
and
malt
at
best
taste
nice
hop
punch
with
malt
backbone
citrus
is
present
very
drinkable
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
a
little
dryness
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
just
a
notch
higher
than
expected
interesting
that
this
is
an
amber
has
the
appearance
of
most
apas
and
could
easily
pass
as
one
definitely
worth
sampling
eric
this
beer
is
as
if
someone
mixed
a
pale
ale
and
an
amber
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
golden
orange
there
is
a
fair
head
with
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
hoppy
the
taste
is
good
like
stated
above
amber
and
pale
ale
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
there
is
a
nice
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
bells
makes
some
fine
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
thanks
to
derbert
for
the
offering
medium
to
full
bodied
for
an
amber
this
was
just
an
excellent
drinker
for
one
or
many
thanks
murrayswine
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
not
too
heavy
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
great
session
beer
and
one
of
many
solid
offerings
from
bells
this
beer
is
a
regular
in
my
fridge
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
this
may
also
be
a
good
crossover
beer
a
very
clear
rusty
hue
enteers
my
glass
with
some
friendly
bubbling
the
aroma
is
a
slightly
thick
amber
malt
with
some
real
subtle
english
hopping
this
mix
gave
the
aroma
a
very
biscuity
aroma
the
taste
is
equally
biscuity
that
takes
on
a
more
sweet
hawaiian
bread
profile
a
little
grityy
on
the
tongue
but
good
carbonation
to
clean
that
up
bells
continues
to
confound
me
with
thier
naming
system
the
pale
ale
is
some
type
of
wheat
beer
while
this
american
amber
is
a
classic
esb
imho
weird
at
any
rate
this
is
still
a
solid
entry
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
murky
orange
color
a
nice
foamy
off
white
head
builds
as
you
pour
and
continues
building
to
a
nice
full
one
inch
cap
after
you
finish
this
slowly
drops
to
a
nice
think
coating
on
the
top
of
beer
that
leaves
nice
spotches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
sweet
toffee
like
smell
with
some
spicey
citrus
hops
notes
it
smells
like
a
clean
smooth
beer
the
malt
is
really
the
backbone
of
this
beer
when
you
taste
it
everything
else
seems
to
go
the
the
background
but
things
are
balanced
so
that
it
is
not
overly
sweet
some
earthyness
to
the
malt
nice
dry
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
has
been
my
biggest
surprise
of
the
bells
beers
ive
tried
it
was
the
one
i
was
expecting
the
least
from
but
probably
the
one
i
enjoyed
the
most
not
a
knock
your
socks
off
brew
but
a
good
solid
every
day
beer
this
one
was
kinda
all
over
for
me
it
was
orangish
red
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
and
some
small
chunks
smell
is
exceptional
with
a
peach
and
plum
smell
up
front
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
hops
to
follow
taste
is
a
bit
above
average
nice
and
complex
but
reminds
me
alot
of
flavored
sparkling
water
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
are
very
good
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
rich
without
feeling
heavy
i
could
work
my
way
through
several
of
these
without
feeling
overwhelmed
or
like
i
compromised
for
endurance
sake
welcome
to
the
rotation
bells
amber
drinkability
this
is
very
good
and
goes
down
well
very
sessionable
i
will
look
for
a
new
bottle
from
the
brewery
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
there
are
too
many
beers
in
front
of
it
in
line
bells
selfproclaimed
flagship
brew
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
streams
of
carbonation
and
some
tiny
bits
of
yeast
getting
kicked
around
the
caramel
malts
dominate
this
one
but
it
does
have
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
that
add
a
little
more
depth
to
the
flavor
comes
off
a
bit
dry
with
a
slight
metallic
flavor
overall
its
a
solid
amber
with
a
good
malt
base
but
bells
has
a
wide
array
of
better
brews
overall
a
fine
example
of
an
easydrinking
amber
ale
wow
bells
scores
big
again
a
copper
color
with
hints
of
a
golden
hue
on
the
sides
a
small
head
forms
white
in
color
a
disappears
very
quickly
the
scent
of
malt
is
very
evident
not
much
in
hop
aroma
there
are
some
fruity
aromas
that
are
there
as
well
the
taste
is
mostly
of
the
malt
which
makes
it
very
mild
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
tad
watery
azt
the
beginning
then
it
gains
more
body
as
it
crosses
the
palate
this
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
the
sweet
malty
flavor
making
it
favorable
to
drink
overall
though
it
needs
some
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
and
even
a
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
craft
beer
great
beer
over
all
old
stand
by
for
most
of
us
michiganders
verdict
its
pretty
good
except
for
the
distraction
of
the
offflavors
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
dvery
good
but
almost
too
sweet
for
me
not
sure
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
more
in
a
sitting
as
a
result
new
penny
in
color
im
sorry
forgive
me
but
i
just
cant
get
excited
about
amber
ales
with
no
hop
aroma
subtle
malt
aroma
with
a
light
hint
of
caramel
and
a
suggestion
of
doughy
yeast
youd
think
malt
magician
larry
bell
could
come
up
with
something
a
little
better
smelling
than
this
mild
mediocre
malt
flavor
which
is
very
crisp
but
overall
husky
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
with
herbaceous
weedy
hops
lacking
bitterness
and
a
pronounced
hop
flavor
and
aroma
this
seems
like
an
amber
ale
from
a
crappy
brewpub
clear
amber
capped
with
a
short
white
head
that
settles
into
a
solid
ring
some
fine
bubbles
ended
up
sticking
to
the
glass
malty
caramel
and
brown
sugar
aroma
with
a
bit
of
toasted
grain
husk
fruity
as
well
with
floral
and
citrus
hop
character
pleasant
malt
sweetness
with
balanced
bitterness
and
moderate
hop
flavour
some
caramel
into
the
finish
mediumlight
body
medium
carbonation
with
a
solid
mouthfeel
quite
nice
another
topnotch
beer
from
bells
ive
had
better
bottles
of
this
beer
not
as
flat
so
ill
probably
have
to
review
this
brew
again
in
the
future
to
insure
a
fair
whack
drinkability
nothing
spectacular
i
didnt
really
want
another
one
in
fact
i
could
barely
finish
the
first
one
a
really
drinkable
amber
ale
even
though
its
a
bit
undercarbonated
some
ambers
are
much
hoppier
north
coasts
red
seal
while
this
is
very
very
similar
to
anderson
valleys
boont
amber
except
for
two
important
areas
its
less
filtered
leaving
a
lot
more
substance
in
each
sip
and
this
bottle
was
undercarbonated
the
bottle
conditioned
bubbles
add
a
very
nice
texture
and
leave
it
feeling
more
crafted
than
avs
boont
this
may
not
get
as
much
attention
as
bells
many
fine
stouts
but
its
just
as
well
made
d
i
could
buy
this
again
i
could
drink
a
few
does
it
stand
out
not
really
for
me
but
compared
with
bmc
this
is
an
okay
drinker
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
yet
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
one
and
a
half
fingers
in
height
creamy
and
recedes
slowly
the
aroma
is
a
lot
more
complex
than
most
amber
ales
it
is
mostly
malt
but
there
is
a
hop
presence
which
makes
it
so
the
beer
doesnt
smell
sugary
the
taste
is
incredibly
balanced
niehter
bitter
nor
sweet
stand
out
but
they
are
both
there
playing
with
my
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
most
importantly
it
isnt
sticky
the
way
most
amber
ales
seem
to
be
overall
amber
ale
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
styles
this
brew
is
an
exception
it
is
what
i
would
like
all
amber
ales
to
be
a
beer
than
is
less
hoppy
than
a
pale
ale
but
not
so
sugary
that
is
it
sticky
12
ounce
bottle
bells
amber
pours
out
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
some
toasted
malts
and
spicy
hops
the
flavor
starts
off
with
some
caramel
followed
by
husky
grain
some
fruitiness
comes
in
at
the
middle
finishes
bitter
with
a
mild
hoppiness
that
tastes
just
a
bit
skunky
medium
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
this
beer
has
nice
balance
but
the
flavor
is
only
ok
just
an
average
amber
ale
aroma
is
grassy
with
hints
of
drier
hay
light
amber
color
with
a
very
nice
two
finger
thick
white
head
flavor
is
all
smooth
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
in
the
finish
this
will
be
overlooked
because
it
doesnt
have
any
wow
factor
but
this
a
damn
fine
beer
excellent
lacing
a
beautiful
head
and
flavor
that
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
overall
a
great
choice
for
a
session
brew
just
a
solid
everyday
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
beige
head
above
the
clear
copper
brew
what
head
there
was
lasts
pretty
nicely
with
abundant
bubbly
lacing
aroma
is
wellbalanced
with
pronounced
malt
present
taste
is
also
balanced
with
grain
husks
and
hoppiness
duking
it
out
ending
more
or
less
a
draw
but
with
the
bitterness
lingering
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
pleasing
and
this
one
would
make
a
nice
everyday
type
of
brew
drinkability
was
quite
good
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
could
sure
go
for
another
right
now
thanks
to
frozensoul327
for
the
trade
slàinte
wellbalanced
and
fairly
complex
for
the
style
the
bells
yeast
is
definately
detectable
and
lends
an
interesting
twist
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
a
michigan
classic
slightly
cloudy
copperamber
with
a
finger
of
tan
frothy
head
special
bready
malts
and
s
a
little
caramel
kissed
by
a
small
hop
note
tickles
the
nose
tantalizing
and
and
giving
you
a
good
idead
of
what
is
to
come
slightly
fruity
caramel
and
an
unertone
of
biscuity
malts
hops
are
well
balanced
kiss
of
bitterness
light
body
with
a
slightly
slick
feel
and
nice
lively
but
not
frothy
carbonation
wow
drinkable
a
new
balanced
session
brew
for
me
why
has
it
taken
me
this
long
to
drink
this
beer
its
all
over
around
here
even
the
grocery
stores
that
consider
heineken
a
special
beer
have
this
pours
a
deep
murky
orange
with
a
slight
foamy
head
it
would
be
very
nice
to
look
at
if
there
was
more
of
a
head
smells
very
sweet
but
with
a
good
balance
of
spices
to
keep
it
from
being
sickly
sweet
moderately
plain
though
given
the
nose
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
level
of
broadness
and
subtlety
in
the
taste
spicy
and
slightly
metallic
at
first
but
not
overkill
ie
dogfish
90
ipa
the
beer
becomes
honeysweet
and
wellrounded
this
is
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
dits
an
unoffensive
thrist
quencher
its
quaffable
but
not
particularly
special
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
the
taste
smell
and
sensation
that
rushed
not
only
through
my
mouth
but
through
my
whole
body
was
absolutely
delightful
dthis
beer
has
a
nice
hop
taste
with
a
good
malt
backbone
the
hops
are
citrus
flavors
but
they
have
depth
so
you
cant
really
pick
out
one
flavor
the
malt
has
lots
of
pale
but
some
toasted
malt
to
give
it
depth
and
character
nice
smooth
amber
caramel
malt
slightly
nutty
with
a
good
dose
of
bitter
hops
for
balance
there
are
some
yeast
notes
ofbanana
way
in
the
back
nice
dry
finish
the
body
starts
off
a
little
more
than
full
but
the
dryness
and
carbonation
clear
it
without
being
too
abrupt
a
classic
session
beer
tasting
notes
are
peach
apricot
colored
murk
with
no
lace
no
foam
too
flat
straightforward
amber
maltiness
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
way
too
flat
pours
cloudy
amber
with
tan
head
my
wife
could
smell
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
three
feet
away
it
is
sweet
but
i
like
the
citrus
tang
of
this
beer
mix
with
caramel
overtones
at
end
thier
is
enough
hops
to
give
it
a
good
balance
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
edit
you
know
this
is
like
some
kind
of
crazy
wheat
beer
only
with
the
citrus
already
added
in
for
you
crazy
just
crazy
bells
amber
begins
a
nice
darkamber
color
it
is
somewhat
opaque
with
a
fine
halfinch
white
head
there
are
sediment
particles
discernable
through
the
hazy
aura
of
the
brew
it
smells
crisp
and
fruity
malt
and
citrus
notes
are
there
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
a
light
floral
aroma
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
not
terribly
complex
there
is
little
hop
action
the
taste
of
malt
and
fruity
elements
are
there
sweetness
level
is
high
but
overall
the
flavor
is
not
exceptionable
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
tart
feeling
on
the
tongue
not
offensive
but
the
relatively
high
level
of
carbonation
and
lack
of
fullness
make
for
a
less
than
substantial
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
drinkable
to
a
degree
it
is
not
however
the
most
flavorul
or
easily
appreciated
while
above
mediocre
and
certainly
session
worthy
it
is
not
the
best
that
bells
has
to
offer
overall
a
very
solid
but
somewhat
unexciting
beer
very
very
drinkable
any
time
of
the
year
i
wont
be
running
out
to
get
more
of
this
and
if
you
are
shopping
for
it
look
at
the
bottles
first
to
see
how
how
much
sediment
is
in
the
bottom
crisp
refreshing
nice
label
hopback
is
my
existing
benchmark
for
ambers
but
this
has
a
nice
focus
on
the
sweetness
with
enough
hops
to
show
through
i
love
munich
malts
mmm
i
also
love
the
texture
of
this
beer
the
munich
gives
it
a
great
chance
to
stick
around
while
your
tastebuds
do
their
thing
bready
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
with
a
clean
light
caramel
malt
sweetness
balanced
by
hop
bitterness
body
is
fuller
than
most
of
this
style
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
butterscotch
continues
to
emerge
with
warming
finish
is
clean
bittersweet
with
bready
malt
notes
very
drinkable
smooth
somewhat
creamy
with
light
effervescence
medium
bodied
a
good
beer
my
only
wish
was
that
the
taste
had
been
as
complex
as
the
nose
was
drinkability

excellent
drinkabilitydelicious
with
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
the
longlasting
citrusy
finish
makes
me
want
more
and
more
a
beer
for
the
long
haul
bright
orange
in
colour
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
surprisingly
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
mainly
lemon
orange
and
perhaps
even
a
bit
of
peach
there
are
some
nice
caramel
flavors
but
little
contribution
from
the
hops
fairly
thick
bodied
and
mellow
not
really
what
i
expected
from
this
brewer
and
not
quite
up
to
the
regular
high
standards
of
this
brewery
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
its
just
been
too
long
five
years
since
ive
enjoyed
my
first
and
last
experience
with
bells
way
before
i
enjoyed
all
these
styles
i
made
my
way
up
to
the
eccentric
cafe
for
one
of
the
best
beer
experiences
of
my
life
the
good
memories
came
back
with
this
one
nice
orange
copper
hue
with
fruity
maltiness
that
i
could
not
get
enough
of
overall
another
great
beer
from
bells
they
never
cease
to
amaze
me
with
their
beers
keep
up
the
great
work
bells
d
decent
beer
noticed
that
there
was
sediment
at
the
bottom
that
i
did
not
pour
in
could
have
affected
the
review
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
really
good
beer
bold
robust
and
malty
good
use
of
dark
grains
and
malt
its
a
liitle
hoppier
that
most
ambers
but
it
doesnt
interfere
with
the
sweetness
or
the
body
has
more
of
a
pronounced
alcohol
flavor
and
feel
into
the
body
and
finish
has
some
earthy
yeasty
flavor
along
with
hop
flavoring
less
clean
than
i
like
but
still
good
beer
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
its
the
first
amber
that
ive
had
that
is
cloudy
with
a
little
bit
of
sediment
in
it
the
color
is
a
dark
orange
pours
a
lowmedium
head
that
doesnt
last
long
aside
from
the
edge
of
the
glass
taste
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
would
care
for
but
still
has
decent
malt
to
balance
it
pours
a
bright
copper
the
color
of
a
new
penny
nice
little
foamy
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
malty
sweet
aroma
with
hops
taking
a
back
seat
whole
lot
of
sweet
caramelly
doughy
malt
up
in
this
beer
hop
bitterness
is
substantial
with
floral
and
slightly
citric
flavor
not
at
all
overwhelming
though
really
well
balanced
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
sitting
down
and
sipping
a
few
of
these
definitely
a
great
example
of
the
style
uf
i
decant
the
12oz
longneck
into
an
appropriate
drinking
vessel
a
tan
head
of
about
12
rises
up
and
slowly
fades
away
leaving
a
persistent
ring
of
lace
i
immediately
catch
malt
and
hop
aroma
the
beer
is
fairly
clear
and
a
pale
copper
color
i
must
have
poured
to
fast
as
i
have
floaters
in
the
beer
i
have
read
that
bells
beers
are
bottle
conditioned
so
im
not
alarmed
by
the
floaters
flavor
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
balanced
nicely
with
american
hops
although
i
cant
make
out
the
specific
hop
the
hop
bitterness
finishes
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
pours
clear
with
a
copperorange
color
and
a
thick
creamy
white
head
with
lacing
that
lasts
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
malt
with
a
slight
spiciness
from
the

flavor
profile
consists
of
big
backbone
of
sweet
maltiness
with
a
bit
of
a
caramel
followed
by
bit
of
fruitiness
a
mild
spicy
hops
flavor
and
bitterness
balances
the
flavor
profile
out
overall
a
rich
creamy
ale
that
is
sure
to
please
a
good
transition
beer
not
a
bold
strong
bells
but
a
very
decent
brew
better
than
a
national
brand
anything
nice
hops
like
a
pale
ale
well
malted
very
good
after
fish
i
am
a
missionary
in
people
dropping
white
wine
altogether
particularly
after
fish
when
beer
is
an
ancient
companion
very
nice
amber
colored
brew
with
an
off
white
two
finger
head
smell
is
just
slighly
sweet
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
so
well
rounded
slighly
sweet
caramel
amlt
flavor
with
a
perfect
hop
zing
to
balance
it
out
delicious
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
day
drinkability
is
good
also
a
decent
amber
ale
dont
know
if
i
would
call
it
the
flagship
of
bells
but
still
good
enough
for
repeat
buying
overall
a
splendid
example
of
a
style
thats
been
butchered
and
pimped
for
over
15
years
this
is
a
model
interpretation
of
an
easy
drinking
yet
refined
and
calculated
amber
ale

an

wash
tub
with
this
and
fire
up
the
coals
its
summertime
baby
this
is
how
we
do
it
in
michigan
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
with
a
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
very
long
it
smells
of
malt
and
i
can
detect
a
faint
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
malt
and
caramel
there
is
a
light
hop
after
taste
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
i
recommend
it
well
balanced
overall
and
very
sessionable
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
bold
and
cloudy
copper
color
not
quite
amber
really
there
is
a
nice
head
retention
and
it
appears
to
have
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
the
first
smells
are
of
caramel
malts
teasing
my
senses
and
that
later
changes
to
a
large
wiff
of
hops
that
stays
through
the
rest
of
the
session
the
tastes
are
strong
of
hops
a
little
bitter
and
souring
the
aftertaste
almost
makes
you
smack
your
tongue
on
the
roof
of
your
mouth
after
your
frist
few
drinks
there
is
a
bready
flavor
sensed
also
it
doesnt
have
the
red
beer
flavor
or
smell
that
i
expected
it
too
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
cascading
into
my
pint
glass
it
forms
an
attractive
looking
dark
copper
color
topped
off
with
a
generous
head
good
head
retention
and
good
lacing
the
smell
was
big
on
the
malts
with
a
slight
hop
bouquet
true
to
the
aroma
the
taste
was
long
on
the
malts
smooth
and
creamy
malt
was
kept
in
check
with
some
tight
carbonation
sweet
malt
caramel
a
little
butter
was
first
on
the
palate
some
good
toasty
flavor
leads
into
crisp
hops
for
a
dry
citrous
finish
after
you
have
a
few
sips
you
begin
to
notice
a
dry
bitterness
that
is
almost
coffeelike
surprisingly
complex
taste
that
i
missed
on
the
first
sip
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
good
choice
for
a
flagship
brew
i
really
think
this
would
please
the
masses
as
with
other
beers
in
the
bells
line
the
flavors
are
long
lasting
and
the
beer
is
well
crafted
pours
a
deep
copper
not
quite
an
amber
in
my
book
though
looks
nice
very
good
lacing
and
good
head
retention
it
hangs
out
for
a
while
smells
slightly
yeastybready
and
a
mostly
malted
barley
smell
taste
is
very
bready
sweet
with
a
pinch
of
hops
in
there
mouthfeel
is
robust
for
style
carbonation
is
just
right
this
is
a
great
crossover
or
session
beer
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
amber
in
color
indeed
with
a
nice
lacing
white
head
as
well
the
aroma
is
malty
bread
and
caramel
tinged
with
toffee
and
light
hops
as
it
warms
the
aroma
shifts
more
to
the
hops
with
a
definate
citrus
and
pine
scent
and
a
slight
bit
of
diacetyl
the
flavor
is
sweet
toasty
with
fruity
yeast
in
the
background
decent
bitterness
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
finish
this
one
off
overall
this
is
still
a
great
beer
its
nice
to
see
bells
still
getting
the
job
done
pours
a
hazy
but
bright
amber
color
with
a
decentsized
creamcolored
head
loads
of
particulate
matter
suspended
in
this
beer
head
dies
back
to
a
thin
blanket
of
foam
with
good
retention
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
clean
aroma
of
carmel
malt
and
a
hint
of
piney
hops
taste
is
more
pineearthy
hops
up
front
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
a
solid
malt
base
slightly
sour
aftertaste
body
is
fairly
light
with
moderate
carbonation
ive
enjoyed
most
bells
that
ive
tried
and
this
is
no
exception
this
to
me
is
yet
another
disappointing
bells
beer
while
its
better
than
some
other
bells
beers
such
as
cherry
stout
and
two
hearted
shudder
it
isnt
a
beer
id
buy
again
there
are
just
too
many
good
ones
out
there
to
waste
my
money
on
semidrinkable
brews
tried
this
one
on
a
recent
business
trip
with
a
heavy
potato
sausage
dinner
it
appears
as
an
amber
hazy
liquid
with
a
thin
but
firm
and
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
very
pleasingmalty
and
doughy
ripe
fruit
and
a
little
butterscotch
caramel
and
some
flowery
hops
foretaste
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
solid
malt
flavor
hops
really
come
out
in
the
midtaste
and
the
beer
finishes
with
a
notable
bitterness
it
was
a
very
nice
accompaniment
to
my
mealexactly
what
i
imagine
in
a
drinkable
flavorful
ale
poured
cloudy
copper
med
sized
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
aroma
hopsmalts
hint
of
yeast
a
some
sweetnessnice
balance
flavorcant
put
the
buds
to
it
but
a
slight
sweetness
almost
like
pineapple
than
some
bitterness
had
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
finish
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
it
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
sediment
floating
in
it
that
eventually
settled
to
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
pale
malt
the
flavors
is
a
light
malty
aroma
with
hop
bitterness
up
front
and
sweet
pear
ending
the
ending
is
crisp
with
a
bready
aftertaste
but
it
is
not
pasty
or
overdone
this
could
definately
be
a
daily
drinker
for
those
who
have
access
to
it
this
is
a
good
beer
with
lots
of
character
i
would
suggest
to
at
least
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
slightly
bitter
beers
final
thought
this
beer
tasted
slightly
better
the
longer
it
settled
so
keep
that
in
mind
overall
a
solid
ale
cloudy
orangetinged
amber
with
a
pillowy
soft
white
head
smells
of
sweet
graham
crackers
with
a
gentle
hop
backing
the
taste
reminds
me
of
homemade
cookie
dough
and
caramel
rolls
very
malty
and
yeasty
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
some
hop
presence
just
enough
to
balance
out
the
bakery
sweetness
one
of
the
best
ambers
ive
ever
had
this
was
a
lightmedium
bodied
brew
with
a
smooth
crisp
start
and
a
smooth
caramel
finish
caramel
and
fruit
tones
lasted
briefly
on
the
tongue
extremely
drinkable
and
a
simple
session
beer
that
has
some
nice
flavor
you
wont
get
bored
with
next
time
i
drink
this
ill
do
a
better
job
of
decanting
solid
offering
i
can
see
why
it
is
the
flagship
ale
nice
amber
color
and
a
decent
head
the
taste
was
more
on
the
lines
of
a
pale
ale
than
an
amber
hints
of
fruit
a
good
malt
base
and
a
surprise
hop
effect
in
the
background
quite
tastey
overall
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
12
think
head
the
head
lingers
for
a
bit
but
dissipates
pretty
quickly
my
nose
picks
up
some
malt
tones
coupled
with
hoppy
undertones
quite
nice
overall
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
floating
in
the
glass
and
even
more
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
first
sip
comes
with
a
strong
sweet
malty
flavor
and
a
bit
of
hop
bite
on
the
finish
biterness
is
hardly
there
mostly
caramel
tones
and
a
bit
of
a
bready
yeast
flavor
its
quite
a
tasty
ale
and
goes
down
clean
and
smooth
this
definetly
would
qualify
as
a
quality
session
brew
bells
produces
some
fine
brews
and
this
one
is
no
exception
pours
a
cloudy
orange
amber
color
with
an
medium
head
that
faded
rather
quickly
lots
of
sediment
good
lace
smell
of
sweet
malt
with
some
citrus
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
caramel
and
vanilla
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
nice
crisp
hoppiness
finishes
dry
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
amber
try
some
if
you
get
the
chance
orangish
red
in
color
sediment
throughout
the
glass
an
off
white
head
that
settled
quickly
lacing
was
nonexistant
aroma
was
of
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
citrus
tang
little
bit
of
caramel
as
well
taste
was
of
sweet
grains
herbal
spice
slight
roasted
bitterness
carbonation
has
a
real
bite
to
it
very
dry
caramel
and
roastiness
keick
into
full
gear
towards
the
end
when
the
brew
warms
up
a
pretty
soild
amber
in
my
book
the
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
something
like
a
weak
tea
the
head
is
about
two
fingers
that
falls
quickly
to
a
nice
coating
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
citrusy
hop
with
some
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
with
the
nose
it
has
a
really
spicy
almost
peppery
hop
finish
a
very
pleasant
surprise
the
beer
is
moderately
thick
without
a
burning
carbonation
overall
good
this
s
nice
drinkable
beer
i
would
consider
having
a
glass
of
it
while
out
if
it
were
offered
i
can
see
myself
revisiting
it
in
the
fall
or
early
spring
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
scent
with
some
floral
hop
notes
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
malty
flavor
that
is
bitter
and
toastey
it
has
a
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
amber
ale
it
has
it
all
a
good
drinker
mouthfeel
meh
plain
some
carbonation
some
body
but
not
much
in
either
drinkability
was
pretty
good
i
have
to
admit
but
like
most
of
bells
lighter
beer
offerings
this
just
doesnt
offer
enough
to
bring
me
back
with
any
regularity
overall
this
beer
isnt
terrible
but
its
not
that
good
either
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
beer
is
way
too
yeasty
man
am
i
going
to
be
regular
in
the
morning
notes
an
ok
beer
something
i
would
repeat
but
not
that
i
plan
to
comments

thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
including
this
in
a
nice
trade
package
orangey
amber
colored
with
darker
colored
flecks
of
protein
in
suspension
fruity
biscuity
and
caramel
aromas
and
maybe
a
little
bit
floral
in
the
hop
department
but
not
too
hoppy
smooth
and
wellbalanced
fruitiness
shines
through
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
fairly
good
i
turned
my
brother
onto
this
beer
a
die
hard
yuengling
drinker
he
doesnt
understand
the
basic
difference
between
a
lager
and
an
ale
funny
how
beer
appreciation
isnt
genetically
predisposed
nice
looking
beer
an
orangeamber
in
color
that
poured
a
nice
2
inch
head
which
left
a
nice
lacing
the
unfiltered
nature
of
this
brew
lends
to
the
interesting
appearance
nose
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
was
well
balanced
starting
with
those
sweet
malts
with
a
very
light
hop
finisha
nice
smooth
taste
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
gentle
on
the
palate
this
brews
drinkability
was
very
nice
a
good
compliment
to
watching
life
go
by
on
deer
lake
at
boyne
mountain
medium
body
medium
dark
amber
color
head
quickly
dissipates
to
a
rim
smells
of
subtle
malt
and
caramel
lots
of
carbonation
the
malt
and
nuttiness
is
roundly
balanced
by
hops
with
a
quick
bitter
finale
a
great
amercian
amber
though
less
flavor
than
i
expected
from
bells
uh
im
in
the
twohearted
camp
as
always
but
maybe
being
nursed
with
this
beer
forever
altered
the
place
in
my
heart
amber
ale
is
another
tasty
beer
from
bells
although
nowhere
close
to
their
best
effort
its
balance
ensures
that
it
will
be
enjoyed
by
malt
lovers
and
by
hop
lovers
alike
a
good
session
ale
that
i
wish
was
available
in
the
hawkeye
state
very
nice
poured
a
nice
light
amber
with
little
head
but
very
clingy
light
malty
aroma
light
creamy
malty
swee
taste
with
a
hint
of
black
currant
nicely
offset
with
finishing
hops
surprisingly
light
mouthfeel
considering
the
taste
finishes
a
bit
fuller
than
the
start
even
though
i
prefer
a
hoppier
beer
i
could
enjoy
many
more
of
these
very
well
done
pours
a
bland
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
ok
looking
beer
just
not
my
style
smell
has
hints
of
caramel
and
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
sneaking
up
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
strongest
flavor
it
has
a
decent
malt
backbone
but
i
usually
like
my
beers
with
more
of
a
kick
drinkability
seems
to
be
high
as
this
is
not
a
very
complicated
beer
i
guess
i
just
havent
learned
to
appreciate
ambers
yet
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
i
just
dont
think
i
will
be
getting
much
more
of
it
the
first
time
i
tired
this
beer
it
caught
my
attention
bell
says
its
a
cask
conditioned
amber
which
was
unusual
and
demanded
an
additional
tasting
session
i
was
surprised
with
the
cloudiness
of
the
brew
almost
weiss
cloudy
but
the
taste
slightly
sweet
initally
with
carmel
overtones
and
a
subtle
spicy
flavor
that
i
really
enjoyed
hmmm
nice
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
nice
creamy
head
that
made
the
experience
even
better
the
aftertaste
was
clean
refreshing
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
ejnoyable
i
have
moved
this
brew
high
on
my
list
to
a
regular
staple
at
the
house
for
get
togethers
and
have
gotten
many
outstanding
comments
about
this
beer
from
guests
as
the
old
tv
commercial
used
to
say
try
it
youll
like
it
i
totally
agree
deep
hazy
copper
color
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
layer
on
the
top
all
the
way
down
lots
of
sticking
to
the
glass
has
a
nice
fruit
and
hops
aroma
taste
is
of
carmel
and
hops
the
bitterness
is
there
but
not
overpowering
i
could
difinitely
session
this
one
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
scent
and
flavor
are
quite
a
mixed
bag
i
can
pick
out
some
yeasty
bread
flavor
some
sugary
sweetness
and
some
apple
sourness
and
then
theres
a
hop
finish
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
none
of
it
seems
to
blend
together
all
that
well
i
enjoy
it
but
amber
ale
isnt
what
i
thought
it
would
be
the
beer
was
poured
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
color
was
a
light
amber
color
that
was
slightly
cloudy
the
aroma
was
of
a
citrusyfruity
hop
the
taste
was
yeasty
with
an
estery
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
fruity
hop
kick
it
finished
with
a
slightly
sweet
yet
slightly
bitter
flavor
but
it
leaves
the
mouth
quite
clean
i
must
say
that
i
am
amazed
with
this
brew
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
it
on
the
back
it
says
its
bells
flagship
beer
and
i
can
see
why
this
beer
pours
a
vibrant
flourescent
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
good
amount
of
lacing
as
well
smell
is
caramel
sweet
and
a
twinge
of
bitterness
as
well
the
body
on
this
beer
is
thick
very
thick
for
an
amber
yet
quite
smooth
as
well
caramel
is
the
main
sweetness
but
i
detect
some
honey
in
there
as
well
citric
qualities
that
mostly
resemble
tangerines
are
very
noticeable
slight
buttery
diacetyl
and
a
yeasty
spiciness
come
through
hops
arent
bitter
but
provide
a
solid
base
and
background
holding
the
body
and
other
flavors
together
the
hops
also
seem
citric
and
maybe
floral
as
well
this
is
a
real
beer
drinkers
amber
probably
too
much
flavor
and
too
thick
for
most
noncraft
drinkers
even
though
it
is
thick
i
feel
that
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
brew
with
ease
well
done
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
even
flavor
definitely
could
have
a
few
more
pours
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
tint
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
into
a
pretty
solid
lace
nose
is
sweet
toasted
malts
and
grains
with
some
underlying
notes
of
butterscotch
medium
in
body
with
a
bit
of
a
buttery
texture
towards
the
end
taste
begins
with
notes
of
buttery
toffee
and
diacetyl
followed
by
some
doughy
and
bready
flavors
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
everything
out
a
pretty
nice
american
amber
ale
and
certainly
a
beer
that
would
make
for
a
wonderful
session
brew
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
sample
drinkability
another
very
well
crafted
beer
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
end
i
have
to
say
that
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
a
little
less
than
i
expected
it
was
like
a
tame
pale
ale
and
im
not
a
huge
pale
ale
guy
to
begin
with
subdued
sweet
start
some
orange
peel
taste
sweet
kick
without
being
too
overpowering
bitter
chocolateroasted
coffee
finish
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
little
while
some
hops
to
make
it
worthwhile
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
i
think
high
quality
and
easy
to
kick
back
while
still
enjoying
the
taste
served
on
premise
at
kbc
a
little
cloudy
and
the
color
is
a
bit
lighter
than
other
ambers
a
thin
head
good
biscuity
malt
profile
likeable
but
really
not
quite
the
thrill
i
had
been
led
to
expect
from
a
bells
but
what
the
hey
kalamazoo
seems
to
be
a
brewpub
heaven
on
to
another
and
another
orangebronze
color
with
a
very
thin
and
shortlived
tan
head
pale
and
malty
with
a
slightly
hoppy
and
slightly
sweet
aroma
mediumbodied
slight
astringinent
flavour
with
an
ever
present
hoppiness
and
even
the
smallest
of
sweetnesses
aftertaste
definately
bittered
from
the
malt
and
suffers
from
the
astringent
characteristics
but
is
not
bad
at
all
overall
this
is
fairly
good
for
an
amber
what
kind
of
water
does
bell
use
all
his
beer
has
a
similar
almost
erie
aftertaste
i
originally
had
this
beer
at
the
bcca
canvention
but
didnt
get
around
to
reviewing
it
now
i
am
and
its
as
good
as
i
remember
it
to
be
a
quality
session
beer
and
the
first
of
many
bells
ill
be
having
bells
amber
poured
a
golden
amber
with
lots
of
big
flakey
particles
and
a
nice
creamy
thick
head
with
nice
retention
almost
stoutlike
the
aroma
was
pretty
underwhelming
with
some
slight
fruity
tones
it
was
a
nice
tasting
amber
with
a
fruity
initial
flavor
and
a
nice
hoppy
finish
overall
a
good
drinking
amber
ale
nice
heavy
amber
color
lots
of
sediment
in
glass
which
is
very
appealing
plenty
of
carbonation
visible
pours
with
medium
head
fruity
green
apple
aroma
mildly
sweet
with
a
thickburnt
toast
combination
to
the
taste
slightly
bitter
malt
over
rides
hops
but
the
hops
which
do
come
through
are
pleasantly
received
rest
deliciously
on
the
palate
the
balance
of
malts
and
hops
linger
and
fade
away
evenly
which
entices
you
to
another
drink
finishes
with
a
hint
of
citrus
with
a
mix
of
straw
overall
one
of
the
most
balanced
well
tasting
brews
available
a
vaporous
orange
on
the
pour
with
a
bubbly
and
light
tan
head
that
is
portly
in
size
with
a
thin
curtain
of

is
butterscotch
sweet
fresh
and
quite
clean
to
the
senses
the
start
quite
sweet
nice

and
the
top
a
light
to
medium

finish
is
brisk
in
its
acidity
hops
mellow
and
pleasant
with

dry
and
long
lasting
quite
nice

from
a
world

nice

for
the
whole
beer
oily

and
malt
on
the
nose
taste
is
toasted
malt
some
sweet
malt
and
touches
of
oily
hop
and
that
unique
bells
flavor
is
it
some
special
hops
or
special
malts
i
dont
know
yet
very
tasty
this
is
by
far
the
best
amber
that
ive
had
thus
far
this
is
a
very
tasty
ale
quite
fruity
ala
two
hearted
but
not
very
bitter
if
i
had
access
to
this
it
would
be
a
great
quaffer
first
time
ive
used
that
orangy
tint
quite
cloudy
citrus
flavors
dominate
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
thanks
for
the
sample

speckled

bready
mix
of
sweet

tones
along
with
a
very
intriguing
hop
aroma
especially
for
an
amber
ale
earthy
tones
with
a
bite
of
citrus
there
taste
great
malt
profile
blends
well
balanced
between
the
doughy

fuggle

and
grain
driven
honey
like
sweetness
with
a
brown

quality
about
the
flavor
mouthfeel
sticky
in
a
good

medium
to
fuller

for

excellent

nothing
to
knock
gotta
give
it
praise
drinkability
challenging
amber
ale
i
am
definitely
impressed
by
the
flavorfulness
of
this
if
this
is
there
flagship
ale
that
speaks
volumes
about
bells
they
make
flavorful
beer
yum
another
tip
of
the
hat
sir
to
fm
for
getting
to
try
this
one
drinkability
i
can
see
why
this
is
their
flagship
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
sane
session
beers
ive
had
second
only
to
oberon
if
you
need
to
show
someone
what
pale
malt
tastes
like
begin
with
this
pours
a
flat
clear
orangish
body
with
a
faint
head
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
caramel
malts
and
hoppy
spice
with
a
decent
balance
between
the
two
the
flavors
are
also
well
balanced
malty
sweetness
followed
by
a
moderate
hop
bite
a
bit
a
green
apples
and
sourness
in
the
finish
the
body
and
mouthfeel
seems
appropriate
for
the
style
a
decent
amber
ale
but
not
impressively
so
cheers
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
sample
ng
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
make
this
beer
easy
to
drink
that
finished
with
a
nice
aftertaste
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
brews
from
this
brewery
the
lable
states
that
this
is
the
flagship
beer
of
bells
and
its
easy
to
see
why
nothing
fancy
it
just
tastes
like
a
beer
only
a
good
beer
making
it
an
excellent
crossover
beer
for
the
people
looking
to
convert
swilldrinkers
it
has
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
head
that
slowly
dissappears
there
are
flavors
of
toasted
malt
and
very
slight
hops
its
mostly
the
maltly
sweetness
that
dominates
here
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
one
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenamber
color
with
3
fingers
of
head
there
is
lots
of
sticky
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
bits
of
flowers
and
pine
to
it
with
a
little
fruityness
the
taste
is
fairly
malty
with
some
caramel
apples
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
to
the
finish
that
balances
it
all
out
the
body
is
just
a
little
above
average
a
little
thin
the
drinkability
isnt
that
bad
though
not
a
bad
session
brew
now
hours
later
the
beer
is
warm
and
less
fizzy
but
not
a
bad
drink
at
all
a
wild
crabapple
tartness
strips
away
the
generous
packed
layer
of
baked
cake
flavor
just
enough
to
reveal
a
slight
aluminum
nuance
a
solid
effort
now
appearing
in
a
kitchen
near
me
thanks
to
brent
hazy
opaque
apricot
color
with
a
thick
orangeybeige
head
that
settles
in
for
the
duration
interesting
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
a
distinctive
banana
smell
some
hints
of
candy
as
well
very
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
big
fat
rings
of
lace
stuck
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
flavor
is
full
but
balanced
with
malt
a
bit
of
hops
and
lingering
pine
and
orange
peel
excellent
beer
with
lots
of
character
for
an
amber
the
flagship
of
bellspours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
nice
medium

headthe
aroma
is
is
sweet
with
a
good

presence
a
very
nice
balanced
ale
starts
out
malty
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
personal
favorite
and
easy
to
find
when
iam
home
in
michigan
flavor
its
a
very
hoppy
amber
but
its
offset
by
sweetness
too
this
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
a
very
nice
solid
amber
ale
always
a
pleasure
to
drink
some
bells
purchased
at
the
brewerys
general
store
on
july
3
2003
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
bells
and
i
really
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
in
fact
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
all
night
at
a
bar
or
party
in
fact
one
just
wasnt
enough
as
it
went
down
very
smoothly
and
i
just
had
to
have
more
and
more
and
more
it
ended
up
being
a
fun
night
at
bells
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
and
am
quite
impressed
with
it
its
a
nice
amber
colored
drink
good
amound
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
its
got
a
nice
sweet
taste
to
it
along
with
roasted
flavors
also
a
hint
of
citrus
is
detected
this
is
one
that
i
would
recommend
this
brew
has
a
mild
aroma
if
any
at
all
its
head
died
out
very
quickly
it
has
a
nice
amber
brown
color
my
initial
taste
contained
a
hint
of
a
fore
taste
that
i
later
tasted
on
the
back
of
my
throat
it
contained
some
carbonation
and
was
a
little
watery
in
flavor
copper
colored
beer
poured
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
however
it
had
a
large
amount
of
sediment
chunks
floating
around
in
it
ive
seen
these
before
in
other
ales
and
they
look
like
little
flakes
of
minerals
usually
doesnt
affect
the
taste
but
it
isnt
attractive
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
sweet
malt
aroma
behind
it
smells
like
a
sweetly
scented
flower
the
taste
had
a
bit
of
a
strong
pine
note
to
it
with
alcohol
clearly
evident
surprisingly
so
for
a
5
5
abv
beer
a
bit
of
a
sourness
was
present
on
the
finish
with
strong
pine
flavors
as
well
very
bitter
as
well
but
in
a
bad
way
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
drinkability
was
poor
due
to
the
off
flavors
im
presuming
this
bottle
was
of
subpar
caliber
ill
revisit
this
beer
later
in
the
year
after
obtaining
another
sampl

and
balanced

all
in

a
very

is

suspended
in

ive
had
this
beer
several
times
before
and
have
never
noticed
this
a
fairly
persistent
head
leaves
rings
around
the

as
it
slowly
diminishes
very
little

bit

through
and
a
hint
of
floral

this
is
mirrored
in
the
taste
which
is
good
but
rather
mild
there
is
a
slight
yeasty
flavor
in
the
finish
a
fairly
smooth

which
is
pretty
good

beer
had
excellent

my
only
complaint
minor
is
that
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
easy
drinking
beer
here
i
had
not
had
one
of
these
for
a
year
or
so
so
it
was
nice
to
revisit
an
old
friend
after
driving
4600
miles
to
get
a
boat
and
a
pit
stop
in
chicago
to
get
beer
from
sams
this
was
my
first
bells
beer
that
i
get
to
try
out
of
the
variety
that
i
purchased
it
poured
out
nicely
keeping
a
good
head
and
had
a
good
amber
color
with
some
cloudiness
to
it
malty
sweet
and
hop
aroma
with
the
hint
of
spiciness
and
fruit
a
smooth
flavor
with
a
finishing
bite
that
leaves
my
tongue
feeling
rough
on
the
top
the
beer
is
not
overpowered
by
anyone
particular
flavor
with
the
malts
and
fruity
hops
balancing
each
other
out
nicely
the
beer
ends
with
a
bready
aftertaste
so
far
so
good

thanks
feloniousmonk
for
the

postscript
notes
nose
moves

warms
lots
of
cream
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the

please
go
get
yourself
one
of
these
coppery
amber
a
fair
bit
of
flaky
white
sediment
decanted
most
of
which
stayed
suspended
but
the
larger
chunks
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
malty
aroma
flavor
is
very
bright
and
lively
malty
tangy
and
moderately
hoppy
all
at
the
same
time
well
crafted
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
lots
of
personality
without
going
over
the
top
this
mildly
hazy
medium
amber
beer
was
a
true
delight
the
small
head
provided
good
lacing
about
half
way
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
sweet
taste
was
clean
and
smooth
with
a
nice
sweet
middle
and
hoppy
finish
some
acetic
flavors
were
present
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
with
good
flavor
and
mouthfeel
taste
is
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
perfectly
balanced
combo
of
mild
fruity
hop
and
sweet
malt
oh
the
finish
is
what
got
me
going
and
wanting
more
its
a
deep
earthy
even
smokey
little
pleasure
that
just
gets
slightly
dry
and
is
just
so
smooth
the
whole
way
through
its
amazing
i
just
wanted
to
keep
drinking
it
feel
is
a
fullmedium
bodied
delight
very
nicely
light
and
clean
with
that
spectacular
finishing
quality
i
just
had
a
weakness
for
great
stuff
on
the
palate
nothing
but
smooth
smooth
smooth
malt
looms
large
in
this
ale
but
its
perfectly
matched
hops
are
tingly
tasty
and
not
quickly
forgotten
i
can
see
tossing
back
a
million
of
these
yumalicious
f
clear
copper
color
with
full
white
head
slightly
sweet
floral
aromas
and
taste
hops
are
citruicy
giving
great
aroma
and
good
taste
i
have
heard
bad
thing
about
it
in
bottles
but
i
drink
it
on
tap
quite
often
with
no
complaints
really
a
great
beer
that
everyone
can
enjoy
this
is
my
first
review
and
its
a
lot
harder
then
it
first
seemed
i
hope
it
helpful
coming
from
the
mouth
of
an
amateur
i
immediately
notice
lots
of
chunks
floating
around
and
settling
at
the
bottom
of
the
mug
the
color
is
amberish
orange
and
there
is
an
ample
white
head
the
aroma
is
easy
to
tell
that
its
a
kalamazoo
product
its
very
enjoyably
sweet
almost
like
a
mellowed
less
complex
two
hearted
aroma
malt
sweetness
is
powerful
and
joyous
to
the
tastebuds
there
is
also
a
citrus
twang
noticeable
with
the
hops
doing
a
great
balancing
act
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
easily
an
allnight
drinker
drinkability
damn
high
once
they
fix
the
sourness
problems
of
late
i
remember
this
beer
being
a
lot
better
and
i
hope
bells
gets
their
act
together
soon
very
cloudy
orangeamber
brew
with
a
big
chuncky
head
very
balanced
aroma
consisting
of
spicy
and
citrusy
hops
yeast
and
malt
that
nice
balance
carries
through
into
the
taste
artful
matching
of
restrained
but
kicking
hops
with
the
toasted
bready
malt
also
some
esters
hang
in
your
mouth
and
nose
after
each
sip
carbonation
is
appropriate
and
the
body
is
light
enough
for
the
style

on
the

nice

bite
in
the
finish
a
little
sour
like
the
pale

its
on
the
pale
side
for
the

and
has
a
similiar

the
body
is
a
medium
amber
but
looks
gold
in
some
lights
aroma
is
less
hoppy
than
the
pa
and
picks
up
some
caramel
notes
the
flavor
also
has
the
slight
caramel
notes
but
is
still
dominated
by
that
crisp
pale
malt
flavor
dont
know
what
its
called
the
hops
are
subtle
to
not
there
in
the
beginning
but
come
out
to
give
you
a
slow
motion
punch
in
the
end
its
a
very
weak
friendly
punch
though
seems
like
the
hop
blend
is
the
same
or
similar
to
the
one
used
in
the
pale
ale
just
in
lower

a
very
inviting
looking
beer
nice

just
perfect
for
fall
hops
are
present
as
is
a
clean
malty
flavor
there
is
something
very
simple
about
this
beer
but
there
is
a
rich
hop
note
that
clings
to
your
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
one
of
those
anytime
beers
nice
amber
color
duh
thick
rocky
head
with
great
belgian
lace
very
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
malt
flavor
very
well
balanced
heavily
malt
but
with
a
noticeable
hops
bitterness
to
avoid
the
beer
being
too
cloying
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
well
made
an
exciting
amber
ale
a
nice
spicy

nose
also
some
malt
sweetness
on
the
nostrils
orangish
in
color
cloudy
chunks
of
stuff
flloating
all
over
beautifull
the
taste
is
definitely
dominated
by
the
malt
sweetness
but
it
is
more
of
a
belgian
style
hard
candy
sugar
type
sweetness
the
herbal
hops
lend
a
nice
balance
ive
had
many
amber
ales
most
are
ok
but
not
real
interesting
this
one
is
veritable
adventure
in
tasting
another
dandy
from
one
of
the
top
breweries
in
the
u
s
this
is
one
great
amber
ale
pours
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
a
sticky
head
that
leaves
big
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
has
a
great
somewhat
sweet
but
balanced
malt
taste
with
enough
hops
to
back
it
up
its
got
great
body
to
it
and
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
making
it
a
solid
candidate
for
a
session
beer
its
no
wonder
kalamazoo
sells
more
of
this
than
any
of
their
other
stuff
and
still
its
not
even
their
best
nice
surprise
for
an
amber
ale
i
was
expecting
something
along
the
killians
line
but
this
produced
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
i
was
not
expecting
which
made
it
taste
like
a
hybrid
of
some
kind
very
interesting
rich
color
and
good
aroma
i
am
anxious
to
try
bells
other
offerings
the
only
downside
was
a
faint
metallic
taste
toward
the
end
not
sure
what
that
was
about
cheers
to
deuce
for
the
sample
the
dense
thick
rocky
and
billowy
head
tops
a
slightly
hazy
amber
light
orange

brew
quite
appealing
in
appearance
for
an
amber
signature
slightly
tart
and
fruity
bell
yeast
esters
hit
the
nose
at
first
but
light
caramel

and
very
mild
but
pleasant
diacetyl

follow
the

nose
is
comprised
of
subtle
but
earthy
willamette
andor
goldings
notes
malt
flavors
are
lightly
bready
and
biscuit
like
while
a
clean
light
caramel
malt
sweetness
dominates
the
well
calculated
hop
bitterness
is
a
hair
shy
of
balancing
the
malt
sweetness
leaving
this
brew
pleasantly
sweet
hop
flavor
is
a
touch
earthy
and
floral
and
british
in
style
the
body
is
more
full
than
the
typical
amber
but
still
is
light
enough
to
provide
for
excellent
drinkability
bells
amber
finishes
bittersweet
clean
and
w
bready
malt
notes
this
is
a
flavorful
amber
and
could
pass
for
a
good
esb
the
beer
is
cloudy
deep
golden
with
orange
tinting
very
slight
head
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
aroma
some
sweet
malt
tones
are
noted
the
beer
has
that
trademark
bready
yeastiness
to
a
small
degree
pretty
good
maltiness
but
it
is
not
so
huge
with
the
caramel
malts
as
some
ambers
are
this
is
a
refreshing
example
of
the
amber
ale
style
some
nice
little
spicy
hop
notes
fruity
tones
are
also
of
note
solid
brew
but
there
are
many
other
bells
beers
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
more
notes
this
is
an
awesome
example
of
the
american
amber
ale
style
robust
and
very
flavourful
yet
still
not
a
problem
having
a
few
or
even
making
it
a
session
beer
right
up
there
with
full
sail
or
anderson
valley
in
greatness
in
this
style
okay
it
has
a
nice
goldamber
color
and
creates
a
nice
bubbly
off
white
head
a
little
light
for
this
style
but
i
beginning
to
feel
this
is
what
this
company
aims
for
an
aroma
of
malt
and
cirtrus
a
flavor
of
malt
hops
and
citrus
a
good
beer
just
lighter
than
i
think
this
style
should
be
man
this
brew
wants
to
rise
this
beer
now
seems
to
exhibit
a
fantastic
balance
between
malt
and
hops
you
get
a
full

light

aspect
that
let
me
down
by
being
yet
another

bomb
maple
autumn
red
lebeling
all
gave
way
to
hops
enough
with
everything
being
hopped
up
spare
me
overall
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
and
in
some
way
i
wasnt
disappointed
certainly
different
from
the
usual
american
styles
think
in
terms
of
heavily
hopped
ipas
and
the
like
but
ultimately
nothing
particularly
special
worth
tracking
down
if
you
fancy
something
a
bit
different
but
i
feel
that
the
maple
syrup
angle
is
somewhat
overdone
in
that
theres
not
actually
enough
of
it
enjoying
this
in
offaly
ireland
on
feb
1st
a
little
late
for
an
autumn
beer
but
still
enjoyable
pours
an
opaque

i

it

be
lost
in
the

caramel
finishes
with
toast
pine
orange
floral
earthiness
which
dominate
the
bitter
lightly
drawing
aftertaste
nicely
balanced
for
an
amber

a
very
hoppy
example
of
the
style
odd
but
nice
quite

good

bitter
hops
come
through
as
well
o
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
and
i
cant
say
i
like
this
one
all
light
traces
of
maple
from
the
nose
disappear
in
the
flavor
a
bit
too
rough
with
the
hop
bitterness
and
not
enough
backing
it
this
was
an
interesting
beer
the
maple
syrup
nuances
were
extremely
subtle
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
maple
note
but
overall
a
nice
fallwinter
beer
more
bitter
than
expected
hoppy
with
a
bitter
bite
if
you
try
this
beer
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
dry
hops
come
through
very
nicely
and
achieve
a
perfect
balance
to
my
mind
i
tend
to
like
my
reds
with
plenty
of
hop
aroma
the
maple
flavour
is
fairly
subtle
but
definitely
detectable
loved
this
and
would
buy
it
again
reddish
amber
in
color
with
an
in
inch
of
tightly
knit
beige
colored
foam
brussels
lacing
aroma
is
of
light
malt
and
is
hard
to
detect
the
flavor
is
mild
and
is
light
malt
with
a
gentle
spiciness
that
is
skin
to
rye
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
crisp
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
anchor
family
the
taste
begins
with
a
hop
flavor
which
is
predominantly
pine
with
a
slightly
fruity
accent
from
the
yeast
which
hints
of
english
character
with
mild
malt
sweetness
rounding
out
the
taste
and
light
woody
flavor
continuing
into
the
finish
with
semidry
and
bitter
quality
overall
a
decent
red
ale
with
that
familiar
anchor
yeast
in
the
taste
and
hops
sufficient
to
balance
the
maple
contribution
seems
to
dry
and
boost
alcohol
rather
than
flavor
or
sweeten
but
that
is
not
unexpected
bigleaf
maple
is
an
okay
beer
than
could
get
better
its
still
a
more
appropriate
beer
for
early
november
than
celebration
ale
sweet
opening
notes
nice
bitter
finish
tried
on
tap
another
excellent
anchor
brew
and
perfect
for
the
fall
season
it
starts
off
with
some
strong
malt
noes
followed
by
a
wave
of
super
piney
hops
notes
but
it
wasnt
necessarily
to
my
liking
bitter
bitter
bitter
no
likey
no
maple
flavor
either
none
just
hops
yech
reviewed
in
real
time
this
beer
looks
great
a
massive
head
of
yellowed
orangetan
rests
atop
a
clear
deepcopper
body
with
a
crimson
cast
and
orange
and
gold
highlights
if
youre
going
for
a
beer
that
looks
like
fall
this
is
it
aroma
displays
spicy
softly
citrusy
grassy
floral
and
leafy
hops
over
a
sugary
caramel
malt
base
so
is
this
a
maple
beer
i
dont
taste
it
particularly
though
it
might
be
there
but
the
malt
itself
is
quite
nice
i
get
golden
caramel
as
well
as
dark
caramel
and
a
soft
toastiness
and
there
is
an
edge
of
sugariness
to
it
but
thats
balanced
by
a
wonderful
spiciness
ok
so
lets
check
the
label
yes
theres
a
hint
of
maple
including
big
leaf
maple
syrup
in
every
brew
it
finishes
with
a
dollop
of
sweetness
and
it
is
there
at
the
start
as
well
but
mainly
the
malt
and
hops
take
the
show
its
surprisingly
complex
and
yet
at
the
same
time
really
drinkable
it
also
seems
to
taste
of
fall
to
me
maybe
thats
the
power
of
suggestion
but
i
think
the
combination
of
its
dry
crispness
and
gentle
sugariness
somehow
reminds
me
of
the
season
as
does
the
spiciness
the
soft
citrus
and
the
grassy
piney
and
leafy
side
of
it
as
well
its
certainly
unique
pleasantly
complex
and
really
wellbalanced
and
polished
worth
trying
fits
fall
perfectly
nice
malty
base
beer
with
a
touch
of
additional
maple
syrup
sweetness
on
the
back
end
very
well
balanced
with
a
nice
orange
vest
and
spiceearthy
spice
presence
to
compliment
good
stuff
o
cant
say
this
is
going
down
well
but
its
possible
ive
had
the
bottle
for
too
long
looks
alright
however
the
aroma
and
flavour
posssess
a
leafy
harshness
along
with
subdued
caramel
malt
and
a
twinge
of
maple
syrup
body
is
ok
i
reckon
the
hop
aroma
has
faded
away
somewhat
not
the
best
red
ale
ive
tried
this
one
left
me
disappointed
which
is
out
of
the
ordinary
for
an
anchor
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
good
retention
on
this
one
aroma
was
pine
and
citrus
sweet
it
had
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
which
left
it
kind
of
sticky
lightmedium
body
and
medium
carbonation
got
a
flash
of
that
maple
right
away
to
the
taste
but
it
disappeared
quickly
booted
out
by
the
big
hoppy
citrus
grapefruit
characteristics
tasting
blind
i
would
have
called
this
an
ipa
inoffensive
but
not
all
that
tasty
a
bit
of
a
sortofhoppy
sortofmalty
chalky
mess
o
an
unusually
complex
and
flavourful
amber
ale
thats
well
worth
a
purchase
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
for
a
beer
named
autumn
maple
there
is
not
much
maple
flavor
but
the
hops
character
is
strong
piney
and
has
a
hint
of
citrus
really
tasty
beer
full
bodied
ale
with
notes
of
caramel
and
hops
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
pours
a
bright
caramel
color
with
a
massive
head
of
dense
lumpy
foam
initial
smell
is
juicy
fruit
and
wild
berries
followed
by
grapefruit
unripe
peach
wood
and
grass
malts
are
biscuity
which
the
maple
syrup
compliments
nicely
flavor
seems
to
be
maltier
to
start
with
a
caramel
nutty
maple
sweetness
but
transforms
into
something
more
green
hoppy
and
bitter
by
the
finish
this
does
help
to
cut
down
the
sweetness
but
the
hops
lose
their
initial
fruitiness
and
turn
grassy
minty
and
piney
which
results
in
something
more
bitter
and
dry
feeling
solid
medium
body
and
creamy
things
are
skewed
a
little
towards
the
bitter
side
and
the
maple
is
subtle
but
this
is
still
pretty
nice
in
an
oldschool
kind
of
way
despite
the
mostly
newer
hop
profile
this
seems
like
something
anchor
has
always
brewed
very
bitter
hops
not
as
sweet
as
expected
which
is
a
plus
in
my
books
but
there
are
hints
of
caramel
and
maple
in
the
aftertaste
crisp
and
delicious
beer
an
interesting
beer
i
definitely
got
the
maple
flavor
there
but
its
soft
not
overwhelming
smooth
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
nice
seasonal
departure
from
all
the
pumpkin
on
the
market
overall
this
was
a
nice
rather
sweeter
but
very
pleasantly
hopped
red
ale
this
one
is
rather
enjoyable
overall
taste
is
rich
and
malty
and
heres
where
the
maple
syrup
comes
into
play
much
better
i
get
the
sweet
maple
playing
on
the
palate
alongside
more
bitter
citrus
hops
tones
very
wellbalanced
i
am
very
happy
with
this
ideal
fall

brew
as
it
perfectly
captures
the
spirit
of

try
it
mild
mouthfeel
no
surprises
good
i
guess
i
just
had
higher
expectations
o
nice
beer
that
is
also
one
of
those
fall
beers
that
isnt
a
pumpkin
ale
but
at
least
with
this
one
i
knew
it
wasnt
compared
to
sts
harvest
just
a
good
amber
i
guess
im
not
crazy
about
this
one
but
its
fitting
for
the
fall
season
overall
this
is
another
damn
good
beer
from
anchor
brewing
malty
slightly
sweet
and
balanced
beautifully
with
some
piney
slightly
bitter
hops
this
beer
is
an
excellent
beer
for
the
autumn
season
and
a
unique
one
too
as
its
not
a
pumpkin
beer
or
an
oktoberfest
beer
which
are
the
typical
beers
for
this
time
of
year
delicious
a
decent
and
innteresting
beer
kind
of
esblike
i
like
the
maple
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
general
umph
to
the
brew
alas
a
nice
fall
brew
this
is
a
solid
brew
for
the
autumn
season
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
belgian
style
glass
first
i
notice
how
beautiful
of
a
color
it
is
regardless
of
the
tiny
amount
of
foam
second
impressions
are
that
it
has
a
clean
crisp
maple
smell
complimented
by
rather
harsh
metallic
nailsdippedinsyrup
taste
its
of
medium
viscosity
giving
it
an
average
mouthfeel
the
aftertaste
is
that
of
rusty
maple
bark
great
beer
this
one
wonder
if
anchor
could
brew
it
with
more
maple
syrup
overall
a
solid
amber
ale
one
that
im
happy
to
have
tried
but
that
i
will
probably
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
procure
again
there
are
other
offerings
that
i
would
likely
choose
first
i
will
say
that
its
a
truly
beautiful
looking
beer
but
then
many
amber
ales
are
to
my
eye
and
as
much
as
i
love
looking
at
a
beer
i
love
smelling
and
drinking
it
more
i
tend
to
grade
low
but
hopefully
consistently
and
tend
towards
maltier

kind

glad
i
got
a

of

the

just
turns
into

overly
bitter
mess
for
my
tastes
overall
drinkability
the
maple
that
is
emphasized
in
the
label
is
not
really
present
and
overall
i
think
this
is
more
of
an
apa
than
an
american
amber
given
the

not
a
bad
beer
though
just
not

i
was

after
the
heat
of
summer
and
just
before
the
chill
of
winter
this
ale
captures
the
taste
of
fall
like
few
do
its
perfect
for
a
day
or
raking
leaves
carving
pumpkins
or
chasing
the
pigskin
not
to
bad
a
beer
all
in
one
that
i
wasnt
sure
about
initially
but
it
was
one
that
grew
on
me
some
and
improved
as
it
was
given
a
chance
to
further
open
up
and
heat
up
a
little
not
one
that
id
suggest
looking
out
for
but
more
than
worth

i
was
hoping
for
the
maple
to
stick
out
a
bit
more
but
this
was
good
regardless
o
this
is
a
pretty
hopped
up
version
of
an
american
amberred
which
is
something
that
i
really
enjoy
somewhat
reminiscent
of
an
apa
i
wish
the
maple
was
a
little
more
present
than
it
is
but
otherwise
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
ok
with
this
but
this
is
one
i
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
or
plan
a
meal
around
killing
this
bottle
by
itself
on
a
friday
night
is
just
an
ok
experience
and
willingness
and
enjoyment
diminish
with
each
sip
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
and
an
interesting
seasonal
that
is
unique
and
easy
drinking
when
you
read
the
label
you
almost
feel
like
there
is
a
hint
of
maple
earthiness
blended
in
with
the
malt
character
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
seasonal
that
i
will
probably
seek
out
again
i
wouldnt
recommend
that
my
children
search
for
it
but
if
you
see
it
and
want
to
chill
hard
like
tebow
in
bible
study
raul
would
recommend
it
enough
overall
its
a
slight
disappointment
but
not
bad
actually
a
true
amber
masquerading
as
a
winter
warmer
i
normally
dont
get
too
excited
about
anything
from
anchor
but
this
one
sounded
too
good
to
pass
up
maybe
i
was
just
excited
to
finally
be
able
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
a
red
ale
any
red
ale
for
a
low
price
but
i
thought
this
was
a
great
fall
beer
not
as
sweet
as
the
name
would
make
you
think
but
fans
of
imperial
reds
will
definitely
find
this
enjoyable
sad
to
see
it
leaving
the
shelves
ive
already
gone
through
two
sixpacks
o
great
mouthfeel
and
a
decent
flavor
that
i
cant
really
complain
about
i
was
just
expecting
more
of
a
maple
presence
definitely
another
solid
beer
from
anchor
though
overall
dont
let
the
maple
fool
you
the
fruitiness
to
this
one
is
the
story
this
is
a
really
good
beer
hops
dominate
the
malts
interesting
beer
that
would
go
good
with
steak
or
some
barbq
ribs
certainly
not
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
flat
harsh
and
barely
drinkable
i
just
dont
understand
how
a
brewery
with
the
resources
of
anchor
can
continue
to
make
so
many
mediocre
beers
rugged
and
spicy
with
some
warming
fusel
alcohol
big
brushstrokes
of
carb
that
almost
singe
the
palate
in
the
crescendo
body
holds
its
own
with
a
medium
wooliness
still
a
great
autumny
feel
overall
a
very
pleasant
unique
ale
maple
is
subtle
in
the
taste
and
nose
hop
blend
works
well
with
malt
profile
regardless
if
you
can
really
taste
maple
syrup
this
is
a
quaffable
and
uniquely
flavored
ale
it
was
good
enough
to
consider
purchasing
another
six
pack
before
the
season
is
over
i
dunno
just
like
some
other
users
here
i
cant
seem
to
pick
up
any
maple
syrup
what
i
do
get
though
is
lots
of
citrus
and
grassy
hop
flavors
pretty
bitter
and
unbalanced
small
malty
presence
not
a
bad
amber
flavorful
and
balanced
and
perfect
for
a
fall
day
poured
copper
in
color
with
two
big
fingers
of
offwhite

the
head
retained
well
and
left
complex
layers
of
thick
lacing
other
than
the
faint
essence
of
hops
the
nose
is
pretty
bland
the
flavor
is
light
with
a
dry
finish
there
are
no
discernible
maple
notes
in
the
nose
or
the
flavor
bummer
really
solid
not
sure
if
the
maple
comes
through
but
still
very
enjoyable
pours
into
a
standard

a

but
not
overdone
just
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
im
impressed
with
this
beer
and
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
it
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
overall
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
anchors
lineup
imo
nice
balance
nice
flavors
its
no
worldbeater
but
certainly
one
id
tend
to
buy
from
time
to
time
overall
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
great
that
earl
gray
tea
taste
really
throws
my
sense
of
taste
and
what
i
am
drinking
for
a
loop
o
very
nice
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
unique
o
overall
an
okay
beer
but
not
my
favorite
anchor
beer
or
red
ale
nose
doesnt
gel
the
best
together
though
the
taste
is
better
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
this
is
certainly
an
intriguing
beer
to
say
the
least
the
quality
and
retention
of
the
head
are
excellentit
has
a
nearly
nitro
consistency
which
i
may
have
never
seen
on
such
a
wellhopped
beer
before
and
certainly
not
out
of
a
bottle
theres
plenty
of
fruity
bitterness
to
keep
the
palate
engaged
though
its
a
far
cry
from
what
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
label
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweet
autumnal
affair
youll
likely
be
disappointed
if
on
the
other
hand
youre
looking
for
a
vibrant
creamy
quasiipa
you
may
be
pleasantly
surprised
carbonations
right
for
an
amber
o
this
beer
is
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
and
has
the
type
of
hop
flavors
and
aromas
you
would
expect
from
a
hoppedup
apa
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
taste
has
a
good
balance
with
the
underlying
malts
not
a
bad
beer
and
fun
to
try
but
came
up
short
on
its
promise
feel
mediumfull
with
excellent
soft
carbonation
very
creamy
for
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
i
would
prefer
the
liberty
ale
over
it
any
day
not
bad
of
an
an
experimental
maple
amber
ale
worth
picking
up
for
just
a
couple
of
bucks
oits
just
an
okay
beer
not
something
i
want
more
than
once
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
the
bitterness
seems
to
build
which
i
do
appreciate
its
still
not
something
i
think
ill
be
ordering
again
dont
let
the
maple
tag
full
you
its
not
there
overall
i
wasnt
really
into
this
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
decent
example
of
the
style
but
it
really
didnt
live
up
to
the
maple
part
of
its
name
i
think
it
needs
more
maple
syrup
flavors
and
less
bitterness
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
and
the
taste
only
held
my
attention
a
little
one
is
enough
for
me
i
liked
the
appearance
the
most
its
a
good
looking
beer
i
liked
the
taste
and
drinkability
the
least
they
just
didnt
work
out
as
well
as
they
could
have
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
and
i
would
really
recommend
it
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
i
wish
it
had
better
balance
and
a
more
identifiable
maple
aspect
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
it
is
eminently
drinkable
and
has
some
interesting
elements
that
are
unique
so
its
not
extreme
get
over
it
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
in
the
strict
sense
of
an
amber
ale
with
a
small
amount
of
maple
although
i
expected
the
maple
to
be
much
more
dominant
im
not
sure
how
the
final
product
would
be
as
such
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
solid
fall
beer
that
reminds
me
of
autumn
in
the
northeast
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
appearance
and
smell
offered
the
promise
of
an
excellent
brew
but
the
taste
disappointed
if
there
is
any
maple
aroma
or
taste
it
is
lost
among
all
the
hops
maple
syrup
is
an
expensive
ingredient
so
if
youre
only
going
to
use
a
hint
as
it
says
on
the
label
then
youve
got
to
be
careful
not
to
overdo
the
other
ingredients
price

single
o
a
nice
new
seasonal
from
anchor
it
matches
the
season
well
and
is
quite
drinkable
good
value
worth
a
try
o
i
like
this
one
good
complexity
and
well

a
good

beer
good
but
not
great
would
have
liked
more
maple
still
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
crisp
autumn
evening
o
i
was
surprised
to
find
so
much
hop
in
an
autumn
brew
which
i
think
of
as
maltspice
dominated
but
this
challenges
that
notion
but
to
balance
that
statement
its
not
much
different
than
most
other
quality
ipas
it
may
gain
a
slight
edge
just
from
the
labeling
but
kudos
to
anchor
steam
for
thinking
to
do
so
overall
id
enjoy
this
again
its
a
solid
fall
offering
at
a
reasonable
price
this
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
while
having
very
light
crispness
is
quite
smooth
all
the
way
carbonation
is
light
to
moderate
the
body
is
supported
while
allowing
the
smoothness
to
take
charge
though
the
crispness
keeps
it
from
boring
a
fine
fall
time
brew
here
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
could
certainly
go
for
more
than
one
addendum
the
flavor
greatly
improves
as
it
warms
and
the
maple
finally
wins
the
battle
and
begins
to
come
through
strong
rjt
its
always
nice
to
try
a
new
offering
from
one
the
classic
american
craft
breweries
nothing
exceptional
here
but
a
solid
seasonal
from
anchor
finally
a
new
brew
from
the
anchor
folks
this
one
is
great
pouring
an
orangey
red
color
with
an
inch
of
off
white
head
fluffy
and
lasting
it
smells
more
hoppy
than
expected
i
thought
itd
a
be
a
sweeter
maple
amber
but
its
a
dryer
red
malt
nose
with
citrus
and
pine
in
the
hop
finish
crisp
and
clean
but
also
pretty
big
the
malts
arent
dusty
dry
irish
red
ones
but
they
arent
sweet
american
amber
either
sort
of
a
best
of
both
worlds
here
the
hops
dont
come
in
until
the
end
but
pack
quite
the
punch
pushing
ipa
intensity
i
dont
hardly
taste
maple
in
this
at
all
as
the
hops
really
overshadow
it
if
its
there
at
all
a
very
well
made
beer
though
despite
its
relative
imbalance
fuller
body
prickly
fine
micro
carbonation
and
a
fast
finish
a
perfect
fall
beer
not
totally
dissimilar
to
sierra
nevadas
flipside
red
ipa
really
this
is
a
combo
that
just
didnt
work
for
me
the
last
couple
of
beers
from
anchor
were
duds
to
me
not
sure
what
im
gonna
do
with
the
other
5
of
these
maybe
see
how
they
taste
icecold
10
down
the
drain
i
was
quite
surprised
with
the
hop
presence
in
this
i
went
into
it
expecting
a
maltforward
beer
accentuated
by
the
maple
used
the
hops
though
are
the
first
thing
you
notice
and
are
then
complimented
by
the
malty
slightly
sweet
maple
notes
surprising
but
well
done
overall
great
fall
session
beer
from
anchor
this
is
my
kind
of
amber
not
a
fan
of
crystal
malts
in
ipas
i
welcome
their
relatively
restrained
use
here
for
the
style
restrained
by
lack
of
complexity
to
a
degree
for
sure
but
a
pleasant
and
easy
quaff
and
quite
fresh
as
well
you
know
i
sort
of
went
into
this
one
expecting
one
thing
and
got
another
this
really
surprised
me
i
guess
i
was
thinking
a
warmer
heavier
beer
a
bit
more
silky
but
it
turned
out
to
be
pleasantly
citrisy
even
hoppy
im
not
a
hops
pro
so
forgive
me
ye
ipa
gods
o
the
earth
when
i
take
into
consideration
my
expectations
drinking
this
was
like
late
summer
in
a
beer
with
a
maple
aroma
which
if
you
think
of
it
makes
perfect
sense
autumn
is
full
of
what
has
been
brought
forth
of
the
summer
harvest
so
taking
into
consideration
that
this
is
indeed
a
well
made
beer
and
modestly
attempting
to
understand
the
methodology
and
philosophy
the
brewmasters
over
at
anchor
might
have
been
shooting
for
and
from
im
inclined
to
like
this
new
bigleaf
maple
autumn
red
so
much
so
ive
put
it
on
my
weekly
beer
list
o
a
decent
brew
but
when
i
think
maple
syrup
i
do
not
think
hop
bitterness
which
there
is
plenty
of
in
this
brew
which
opposes
the
sweetness
of
the
maple
in
a
harsh
way
and
makes
for
a
tart
end
for
that
reason
im
not
impressed
the
maple
should
be
the
star
of
this
beer
not
a
character
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
decent
addition
to
the
anchor
lineup

nice

firstherbal
and
citrusgetting
a
small
amount
of
caramel
from
the

taste
is
far
more
balanced
with
the
caramel
malts
with
tinge
of
salt
equaling
the
hops
blends
very
nice
the
maple
syrup
to
me
seems
more
under
the
radar
but
is
there
in
a
almost
subconscious
way
very
nice
palate
bitterness
lingers
a
while
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
i
like
overall
tasty
amber
good
fall
drinking
silly
me
for
thinking
the
name
was
three
words
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
bronze
topped
by
a
couple
fingers
of
light
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
mixed
greens
light
flowers
and
a
slight
breeze
of
spearmint
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
strong
undercurrent
of
very
mild
toffee
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
i
cant
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
its
not
what
i
can
say
is
that
i
didnt
care
for
it
there
is
no
real
balance
the
hops
seem
stagnant
and
out
of
place
and
that
weird
mint
character
doesnt
endear
the
beer
to
my
tastebuds
poured
into
a
chuckanut
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
copper
amber
with
a
fine
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malt
maple
syrup
apricot
juice
light
grassy
hops
flavor
follows
aroma
with
sweet
bready
malt
maple
light
stone
fruit
juice
and
grassy
mildly
piney
hops
finishes
semidry
with
residual
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
nice
active
carbonation
the
addition
of
maple
to
a
red
ale
works
out
quite
well
here
like
many
anchor
beers
this
is
safe
and
nonchallenging
but
well
made
and
pleasant
to
drink
the
finish
was
slightly
astringent
and
could
be
supported
a
bit
more
by
the
good
maple
malt
in
the
start
nice
fall
beer
o
this
beer
needs
more
balance
and
focus
the
components
are
all
there
but
just
not
constructed
well
i
rate
this
on
its
own
merit
and
not
the
expectation
of
its
type
or
what
the
label
said
this
is
a
decent
ipa
strange
as
it
may
be
overall
picked
up
a
single
bottle
but
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
stronger
than
most
summer
beers
in
both
flavor
and
abv
which
works
well
for
the
fall
thankfully
the
booze
wasnt
too
strong
either
or
else
this
would
have
scored
lower
in
my
book
i
thought
this
beer
was
fine
on
its
own
but
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
expectations
based
on
its
description
or
the
reputation
of
anchors
other
offerings
as
a
seasonal
this
wouldnt
be
a
great
first
choice
and
is
only
worth
a
go
for
those
who
want
to
give
all
the
anchor
beers
a
try
i
hope
that
next
years
is
a
bit
more
on
the
mark
and
worth
picking
up
in
the
midst
of
a
ton
of
other
autumn
offerings
pours
without
too
much
head
good
legs
however
as
the
foam
has
enough
body
to
cling
to
glass
for
a
good
while
after
the
pour
excellent
initial
bouquet
earthy
with
a
robust
hops
nose
pleasantly
surprising
strong
initial
hop
notes
with
a
crisp
full
mouth
feel
crisp
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
goes
down
easy
a
very
good
fall
special
almost
tastes
more
like
a
sierra
nevada
than
a
anchor
brew
excellent
addition
to
their
portfolio
and
look
forward
to
having
around
for
years
to
come
an
interesting
fall
beer
and
not
too
bad
either
meh
a
hoppy
amber
wow
been
there
done
that
about
a
thousand
times
oddly
tartnear
sour
and
metallic
ick
can
easily
skip
this
one
overall
really
good
a
great
seasonal
beer
for
the
fall
showcasing
brown
sugar
caramel
toasted
bread
and
maple
syrup
notes
that
are
all
balanced
by
some
moderate
bitterness
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
red
ale
and
a
fine
beer
from
the
folks
at
anchor
however
its
not
exactly
as
advertised
as
i
got
very
little
maple
from
it
despite
its
other
positive
attributes
i
would
certainly
not
refuse
if
offered
but
probably
wont
seek
out
overall
not
impressive
but
an
average
quality
amber
ale
for
the
fall
t
opens
alright
but
never
really
turns
into
much
light
toast
and
caramel
malt
with
some
earthy
hops
on
the
backend
finish
brings
some
pine
resin
but
its
pretty
mild
almost
more
of
a
piny
sourness
i
was
hoping
for
a
hint
of
the
maple
but
i
never
really
found
it
here
not
bad
but
not
anywhere
near
the
top
of
the
fall
beer
list
another
entrant
into
this
catchall
category
wherein
the
contestant
has
just
enough
to
offer
but
yet
a
whole
lot
of
baggage
to
go
along
with
it
that
im
kind
of
taken
off
the
rails
a
tad
too
early
i
imagine
hardly
captivating
and
rather
lacking
in
the
maple
flavour
so
front
and
center
in
the
name
my
canadian
roots
are
bristling
and
once
again
with
this
brewery
not
altogether
worthy
of
following
up
on
o
this
doesnt
do
much
to
excite
the
taste
buds
but
its
easily
drinkable
more
hop
presence
and
less
maple
syrup
flavor
than
i
expected
this
isnt
anything
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
on
overall
a
very
nice
amber
the
maple
never
really
comes
through
but
this
is
a
very
nicelybalanced
brew
everything
enhances
the
other
here
impressive
great
seasonal
beer
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
definite
hop
presence
sweet
maple
smellstaste
and
a
nice
thick
sticky
lingering
head
the
color
is
absolutely
gorgeous
when
held
up
to
the
light
quite
drinkable
but
still
a
respectable
amount
of
abv
this
is
a
new
fall
favorite
this
pours
a
richly
hued
caramel
with
a
ruby
tinge
theres
a
pleasingly
hoppy
aroma
dominated
by
a
piney
character
yet
undergird
with
some
dank
notes
the
beer
tastes
hoppy
piney
and
slightly
dank
theres
a
lingering
bitterness
undercut
with
a
maple
sweetness
the
flavor
is
piney
and
bitter
tastes
like
autumn
o
i
bought
this
for
the
hops
wish
it
was
exclusively
nelson
sauvin
it
gets
a
little
better
as
it
warms
up
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
a
little
sweeter
pours
a
redamber
with
a
nice
foamy
khaki
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
offers
some
maple
syrup
caramel
grapes
earthy
flavor
is
pretty
similar
with
the
earthy
finish
providing
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
it
a
medium
bodied
active
mouthfeel
overall
an
alright
brew
here
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
as
an
amber
ale
hopped
with
amongst
others
nelson
sauvin
hops
sounded
great
to
me
the
addition
of
maple
syrup
seemed
interesting
and
appealing
too
ended
up
not
coming
close
to
meeting
my
expectations
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
beer
that
i
have
much
need
to
drink
again
glad
i
only
purchased
a
single
of
this
worth
the
purchase
but
not
worth
another
tmo
it
gulps
very
well
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
pale
malt
crisp
before
fading
into
a
wellrounded
body
taste
is
very
brief
and
not
very
memorable
but
the
overall
experience
isnt
bad
overall
i
was
contemplating
how
much
i
liked
this
one
when
i
realized
how
quickly
i
had
gone
through
the
beer
if
im
willing
to
drink
it
like
that
to
search
for
that
flavor
thats
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
then
i
guess
it
deserves
the
rounding
up
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
season
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
through
to
early
winter
maybe
even
the
new
year
i
dont
think
its
robust
enough
to
last
through
the
cold
months
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
maple
and
herbal
and
pine
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earthy
maple
and
woody
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
more
earthy
than
sweet
maple
presence
in
the
flavor
l
label
i
rate
a
5
great
aroma
albeit
overdone
for
the
style
think
there
may
be
some
fermentation
issues
the
harsh
finish
was
offputting
as
well
too
bitter
for
my
palate
wow
this
is
a
really
good
beer
a
bit
of
a
thin
body
with
prickly
carbonation
nice
toasty
maltiness
with
big
hoppiness
and
the
faintest
toach
of
maple
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitterness
very
tannic
with
a
very
bright
clean
and
crisp
finish
complex
yet
drinkable
hoppy
malty
and
flavorful
really
enjoy
it
and
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
this
fall
bigleaf
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
maple
balances
the
fairly
strong
hopping
making
this
taste
more
like
a
traditional
amber
with
a
twist
as
opposed
to
the
in
vogue
red
ipas
this
makes
it
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
the
amber
fan
and
the
ipa
fan
equally
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
beer
is
replacing
the
outstanding
humming
ale
why
you
gotta
play
me
like
that
anchor
o
this
aroma
on
this
beer
was
promising
but
the
flavor
missed
the
mark
for
me
lots
of
harsh
bitterness
and
lots
of
unpleasant
earthy
notes
definitely
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
and
really
lacking
in
maple
flavor
all
you
get
is
some
in
the
aroma
and
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
just
like
right
after
polishing
off
a
stack
of
pancakes
i
cant
even
taste
the
maple
syrup
a
good
beer
but
kinda
all
over
the
place
needs
a
common
factor
to
reel
everthing
in
together
the
body
was
nicely
medium
and
smooth
drinkability
was
good
enough
but
its
not
a
beer
im
going
to
seek
out
a
lot
oddly
enough
i
liked
the
bottle
i
drank
from
the
bottle
last
night
a
lot
better
than
this
one
probably
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
i
wish
there
were
more
maple
syrup
and
the
integration
were
better
but
it
is
a
anchor
beer
so
it
is
worth
a
try
though
its
not
a
beer
you
would
typically
cellar
it
might
be
worth
the
experiment
above
average
this
is
definitely
a
rustic
amber
ale
the
maple
syrup
comes
through
and
the
overall
flavor
is
rather
earthy
the
hops
are
intense
as
well
with
big
citrus
notes
up
front
followed
by
a
piney
bitter
finish
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
of
balance
as
all
of
the
flavors
dont
mesh
as
a
cohesive
unit
that
being
said
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
beer
that
keeps
me
intrigued
dank
hoppy
nose
a
sexy
golden
hue
good
creamy
lacing
and
by
damned
if
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
four
mt
beers
ive
tried
while
here
on
maui
first
new
era
can
for
me
all
fears
about
metallic
favors
gone
as
to
this
offering
amber
is
well
described
so
too
hoppy
tropicals
in
the
nose
with
some
caramel
backing
taste
gives
way
to
standard
bittering
hop
profile
less
so
than
some
notes
of
citrus
pine
floral
tropical
etc
pretty
simple
toasted
grain
sweetness
balances
the
bitters
on
tap
at
beachwood
seal
beach
and
served
in
a
half
pint
as
a
warmup
for
the
bottle
share
slightly
hazy
orange
to
amber
in
color
with
a
finger
of
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
cap
and
leaves
some
patches
of
lace
aroma
is
dank
hops
grapefruit
pine
more
tropical
fruit
and
a
bit
of
an
herbal
note
the
malt
aroma
features
caramel
and
toasred
bread
taste
is
thoroughly
dank
and
moderately
bitter
with
the
tropical
fruit
and
caramel
sweetness
offering
some
balance
early
medium
body
viscous
texture
lower
carbonation
and
a
long
bitter
finish
overall
this
beer
was
still
absolutely
amazing
and
i
would
love
to
drink
some
more
some
time
very
soon
if
possible
love
this
beer
a
month
old
very
dank
and
hoppy
awesome
everyday
drinking
beer
for
me
so
i
received
this
beer
via
the
nbs
bif
thread
courtesy
of
aoampm
what
is
so
amazing
about
this
beer
is
the
smell
id
say
caramel
and
vanilla
pine
with
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
very
prominent
smell
and
it
is
wonderful
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
the
beer
was
fresh
11315
and
exceptional
it
is
called
an
amber
but
it
seems
to
be
more
of
an
ipa
quality
to
me
only
because
the
hops
are
so
abundant
however
there
is
plenty
of
vanilla
and
toffee
sweetness
in
the
taste
at
just
under
7
abv
it
is
not
quite
an
imperial
i
suppose
i
love
nugget
nectar
a
benchmark
imperial
amber
but
give
me
this
over
nugget
anytime
send
more
o
found
this
in
chiang
mai
drank
in
kunming
feb
10th
2015
a
great
brew
im
sure
its
a
little
old
and
would
have
been
even
better
fresh
still
its
holding
out
well
i
dont
care
what
they
call
it
its
an
ipa
its
amazingly
hoppy
for
an
amber
a
great
readily
available
beer
you
can
always
rely
on
my
new
goto
for
any
day
of
the
week
slightly
hazy
cream
sodalike
appearance
with
abundant
lacing
smelling
of
caramel
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
pine
tasting
excellent
balance
between
the
pungent
hop
character
and
the
elegant
malt
back
with
good
carbonation
to
compliment
the
lightly
weighted
mouthfeel
overall
very
nice
beer
unique
and
well
balanced
it
isnt
something
i
would
run
to
buy
again
but
its
tasty
and
satisfying
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
o
i
love
this
beer
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
i
certainly
think
its
an
amazing
yearround
for
what
it
is
especially
given
the
current
ravg
of
4
1
i
think
its
higher
than
that
its
an
amberred
but
i
definitely
enjoy
this
a
lot
more
than
the
likes
of
nugget
nectar
which
is
considered
one
of
the
best
hoppy
amberred
ales
out
there
othis
brew
is
one
you
just
keep
on
sipping
and
the
pint
is
gone
really
great
brew
this
beer
has
a
very
unassuming
can
design
i
wasnt
familiar
with
the
brand
and
didnt
expect
too
much
yes
i
judged
the
book
by
its
cover
took
a
sip
and
thought
hey
thats
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
didnt
think
i
should
rate
it
so
high
because
anything
is
great
coming
from
very
low
expectation
after
a
few
sips
i
put
the
beer
down
and
then
it
hits
me
the
citrusy
hop
flavor
lingers
for
a
long
time
it
just
begs
for
another
sip
then
another
and
made
me
really
sad
when
the
can
is
gone
i
dream
of
this
beer
with
bbq
overall
a
great
example
of
west
coast
hop
flavors
modern
times
beer
has
created
a
very
successful
recipe
here
gaining
some
momentum
from
hop
heads
and
beer
collectors
this
is
a
perfect
canned
hoppy
amber
ale
delightful
so
smooth
and
dank
could
drink
this
every
day
if
it
were
available
in
az
o
this
beer
is
flat
out
fantastic
it
combines
juicy
hop
flavors
with
deep
carmel
bready
malts
it
just
hits
everything
perfectly
it
may
be
a
tad
unbalanced
towards
the
hoppy
side
but
it
is
delightful
great
initial
hoppy
taste
then
the
alcoholic
taste
kicks
in
it
is
alright
nice
dank
resiny
aroma
taste
follows
with
some
piney
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
prickly
carbonation
not
much
bitterness
overall
tasty
brew
really
enjoyed
this
dank
tasting
amber
the
nelson
hops
really
come
through
o
a
nice
amber
with
some
ipa
charteristics
enjoyable
beer
would
definitely
drink
again
pour
is
dark
copper
clear
white
head
large
bubbles
and
lacing
nose
is
riddled
with
sweet
malts
toasted
grains
candied
hops
faint
citrus
flavor
is
thin
very
malty
lots
of
toasted
caramel
bitter
grassy
hops
faint
citrus
medium
body
lighter
carb
o
maybe
this
beer
was
so
good
because
it
was
fresh
nevertheless
it
is
one
of
the
best
hoppy
ambers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
delicious
starts
like
an
amber
finishes
like
a
lighter
ipa
total
4150
stickiest
of
the
icky
enjoyed
this
a
lot
its
an
amber
ale
taste
like
a
unique
hoppy
amber
ale
great
beer
ipa
more
than
anything
o
a
very
well
balanced
amber
that
packs
loads
of
flavor
while
remaining
remarkable
drinkable
tmo
taste
is
of
amber
slapped
with
a
variety
of
dank
citric
and
tropical
flavored
hop
you
can
definitely
get
the
amber
underneath
the
hop
and
its
clean
soft
caramel
toffee
fairly
heavy
but
a
mean
amber
happy
to
have
a
few
of
these
ideal
for
this
cooling
weather
excellent
though
amber
may
be
a
little
misleading
i
think
more
of
a
hopped
ipa
rather
than
amber
but
to
each
their
own
m
pretty
ideal
mediumish
bodied
solid

had
this
beer
some
time
ago
entering
it
here
just
to
catalog
it
oak
flavor
was
way
too
strong
and
just
plain
tasted
wierd
to
me
have
tried
many
sam
adams
beers
but
finding
one
i
like
is
rare
this
beer
has
such
a
smooth
feel
that
is
goes
down
easy
even
thought
there
is
a
bit
of
a
punch
that
was
not
expected
a
real
jem
from
boston
beer
pours
a
nice
redauburn
color
with
a
semithick
head
nose
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
oak
is
notable
but
little
else
is
present
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
and
dries
out
toward
the
end
first
sip
is
big
malty
oak
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
reminiscent
in
some
ways
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
tasted
touches
of
vanilla
and
allspice
but
malty
oak
still
dominates
the
palate
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
inspiring
either
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlow
intensity
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
never
fizzy
though
carbonation
can
be
lightly
felt
as
it
slightly
foams
the
beer
upon
palate
contact
the
result
is
a
semifoamy
semismooth
mouthfeel
that
generally
balances
the
weight
and
flavors
well
closes
fairly
dry
with
ample
stickiness
left
lingering
on
the
palate
if
you
are
looking
for
an
oak
aged
beer
you
will
probably
think
you
dont
taste
any
oak
at
all
notes
my
impression
went
from
oh
cool
something
called
mighty
oak
to
damn
this
beer
is
really
boring
and
i
dont
think
that
i
will
ever
look
for
it
again
o
i
love
this
beer
even
more
so
out
of
a
glass
oak
themed
beers
have
a
complex
brewing
process
that
has
generous
amounts
of
vanilla
and
caramel
very
nice
blend
of
ingredients
im
pretty
sure
this
is
the
last
of
this
beer
i
will
every
have
the
pleasure
of
drinking
so
im
savoring
the
flavor
overall
its
another
nice
offering
from
sam
this
beer
got
better
for
me
as
it
went
along
the
mouthfeel
was
the
best
part
so
smooth
finish
semidry
crisp
refreshing
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
nice
head
that
laces
lightly
and
lasts
longer
than
expected
caramel
and
sweetness
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hop
lingering
behind
it
the
body
is
very
similar
with
light
notes
of
the
advertised
oak
aging
though
this
comes
across
as
fresh
raw
oak
the
oak
works
with
the
caramel
notes
in
the
beer
though
the
beer
comes
off
a
little
watery
for
such
an
otherwise
thick
seeming
beer
finish
is
dry
and
otherwise
clean
the
beer
almost
seems
as
though
they
took
boston
lager
and
threw
an
untoasted
oak
spiral
into
the
keg
for
a
week
3

this
was
an
interesting
experience
im
glad
that
boston
beer
is
experimenting
but
this
isnt
really
hitting
it
for
me
o
a
very
different
and
interesting
take
on
a
red
ale
it
starts
sweet
then
moves
into
the
oak
taste
which
brings
out
a
bit
of
the
sourness
overall
different
and
something
id
like
to
see
more
of
best
damn
beer
i
have
tasted
from
the
sam
adams
family
of
beers
refreshing
colorful
nice
1
finger
off
white
head
wanted
more
of
this
beer
than
the
12
pack
brew
masters
special
offered
very
sharp
taste
equally
as
sharp
after
taste
not
to
bitter
not
to
smoked
tasting
quite
perfectly
infused
in
my
opinion
this
would
be
much
nicer
if
there
were
a
little
more
mighty
in
the
bottle
this
brew
just
misses
a
bit
if
the
woodiness
from
the
oak
were
a
bit
more
pronounced
it
would
have
made
for
a
much
nicer
brew
as
it
stands
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
brew
samuel
adams
generally
comes
through
and
this
is
no
exception
but
there
is
nothing
terribly
remarkable
here
d
very
drinkable
pretty
good
amber
ale
with
the
oak
flavor
adding
some
complexity
a
bit
off
balanced
though
c
a
good
session
beer
o
mighty
oak
is
a
decent
red
the
oak
flavor
compliments
the
style
very
well
o
a
good
ale
definitely
worth
having
but
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
of
other
oak
ales
i
suspect
that
it
hasnt
been
aged
very
long
but
im
not
an
expert
so
i
cant
be
certain
still
overall
well
done
and
well
balanced
o
wait
did
a
caterpillar
really
fall
in
my
beer
presumably
no
not
something
that
youll
slosh
out
into
a
red
cup
and
play
beer
pong
with
this
is
interesting
but
nothing
special
o
interesting
offering
not
quite
in
the
elite
craft
status
but
an
interesting
and
creative
samuel
adams
level
offering
nonetheless
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
reddish
body
with
partially
no
head
to
it
the
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
the
taste
is
right
up
front
with
some
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
then
the
little
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
is
a
nice
touch
great
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
really
good
drinkable
beer
a
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
off
white
head
bits
of
lacing
here
and
there
and
good
retention
mild
carbonation
visible
smell
is
full
of
sweet
malt
with
vanilla
and
cherries
in
the
back
oak
wafts
in
and
out
love
the
big
smooth
amber
ale
malt
taste
with
a
longish
wooden
dryness
bitterness
is
english
tea
leaf
hoppiness
with
oak
and
cherryvanilla
notes
a
mild
sourness
faintly
lingering
as
the
mild
biscuity
malt
blooms
crisp
carbonation
and
medium
light
weight
make
for
excellent
drinkability
a
creative
twist
on
a
standard
that
is
not
gimmicky
or
tricked
out
this
makes
me
think
about
what
was
available
in
the
days
of
wooden
casks
this
may
be
a
resurrection
of
the
flavors
of
old
i
wish
this
one
was
on
the
shelves
year
round
nicely
done
jim
the
oak
comes
through
more
in
the
flavor
but
primarily
this
is
just
a
solid
red
ale
with
something
extra
this
was
my
favorite
beer
from
the
sampler
pack
i
bought
pours
medium
dark
reddish
amber
good
foaming
some
residual
sweet
malty
caramel
smell
strong
vanilla
smell
woody
sweet
taste
with
a
smooth
gradual
finish
the
beer
trusts
the
oak
to
hold
the
sweetness
in
check
rather
than
any
hop
finish
has
a
lot
of
vanilla
nice
blend
good
taste
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
can
get
cloying
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
not
on
my
rebuy
list
overall
im
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
this
is
just
an
ok
red
ale
among
many
appearance
holds
a
reddish
amber
that
supports
a
thin
dissipating
head
leaving
fair
lace
smell
is
light
on
the
nose
with
the
caramel
malt
oak
and
fruitiness
from
the
hops
taste
of
the
malt
vanilla
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
leaving
a
lightly
bitter
dry
oak
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
on
the
medium
side
with
good
carbonation
pretty
much
a
simple
amber
leaving
not
much
to
mull
over
o
a
pretty
average
beer
not
very
complex
the
bottle
described
the
beer
as
having
caramel
vanilla
and
oak
notes
but
i
could
taste
no
oak
or
vanilla
notes
the
taste
is
slightly
caramel
with
mild
amarettolike
almond
taste
with
a
slight
nuttiness
and
light
cherry
accent
with
the
tannin
and
mild
toasty
malt
follows
the
yeasty
flavor
combines
with
the
aforementioned
flavors
with
a
bready
note
and
light
oaky
vanilla
in
the
background
as
it
finishes
overall
a
good
amber
a
good
amber
w
mild
oak
influence
in
the
flavor
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
but
i
am
sure
the
oak
made
this
better
than
just
the
base
alone
drinkability
is
on
the
low
side
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
fine
ale
thats
worth
seeking
out
the
mightly
oak
ale
from
sammy
a
is
a
nice
offering
but
not
spectacular
it
is
ruby
red
with
foamy
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
smell
is
typical
of
most
ambers
neat
and
malty
there
is
a
slight
woodyoak
twang
to
the
amber
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
big
carbonation
overall
it
is
decent
o
a
good
everyday
beer
to
drink
if
you
into
ales
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
overall
a
bit
on
the
simple
side
but
im
sure
thats
what
sa
was
aiming
for
pleasant
enough
overall
interesting
not
spectacular
but
a
decent
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
overall
maybe
someone
else
can
make
a
low
abv
oaked
ale
because
this
is
not
really
any
better
than
a
macro
such
as
michelob
amber
bock
actually
i
would
rather
have
amber
bock
oanother
decent
beer
from
the
mix
pack
too
bad
alpine
spring
is
the
seasonal
when
whitewater
and
might
oak
are
better
not
a
beer
id
have
on
a
regular
basis
but
an
interesting
one
off
samuel
adams
mighty
oak
ale
is
a
very
clear
amber
ale
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
a
blotch
and
leaves
decent
lacing
it
has
a
faint
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
vanilla
and
oak
its
medium
bodied
and
starchy
with
a
dry
scratchy
finish
it
tastes
pretty
sweet
with
loads
of
oak
theres
a
strong
note
of
dark
cherry
vanilla
and
caramel
theres
some
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
not
what
id
call
a
refreshing
beer
but
it
has
a
reasonably
complex
taste
i
personally
would
prefer
something
like
this
to
be
balanced
out
with
more
hops
but
thats
not
the
focus
of
this
one
it
all
revolves
around
the
oak
i
find
it
odd
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
usual
sam
adams
logo
on
the
label
and
instead
the
name
of
the
beer
interesting
pours
an
amberred
smallish
white
head
to
it
faint
caramel
aroma
decent
mouthfeel
thin
bodied
some
caramel
malts
quite
watery
really
dont
taste
any
oak
in
this
one
clean
finish
this
one
was
a
big
meh
for
me
way
too
thin
and
watery
and
the
taste
just
isnt
there
guess
they
all
cant
be
winners
drinkable
but
not
much
else
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
darkish
red
color
with
a
small
whitehead
that
dissipates
but
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
slight
hoppy
aroma
tastes
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
not
much
complexity
is
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonated
properly
with
a
good
finish
overall
a
slightly
above
average
red
ale
overall
i
think
id
tire
of
this
after
a
couple
i
like
the
take
on
the
style
and
the
layers
of
flavors
a
decent
fruity
ale
with
some
nice
accents
came
with
two
in
the
brewers
choice
12
pack
thats
probably
enough
for
me
dont
think
id
need
to
get
six
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
its
quite
heavy
on
the
oak
flavor
and
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
behind
it
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
in
a
six
pack
if
it
existed
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
feels
a
bit
like
their
irish
red
with
a
modest
oak
character
but
thats
just
me
overall
a
good
red
ale
but
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
taste
though
overall
a
nice
tasting
beer
good
use
of
malts
although
the
oak
could
of
been
a
little
stronger
o
the
oak
is
the
most
interesting
thing
here
the
underlying
beer
seems
to
be
on
the
simple
side
i
appreciate
that
this
is
just
oak
and
not
bourbon
soaked
oak
but
it
needs
something
else
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
go
looking
for
it
hopefully
the
recipe
can
be
tweaked
and
we
can
see
mighty
oak
version
2
in
the
future
from
either
sam
adams
or
another
brewery
more
oaked
beers
please
overall
not
a
bad
brew
this
is
your
everyday
type
of
ale
so
dont
expect
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
i
grabbed
in
a
variety
pack
and
wasnt
disappointed
salud
o
it
has
its
highs
and
lows
the
oak
character
is
good
but
doesnt
stand
out
enough
finishes
too
dry
and
the
taste
just
doesnt
wow
me
this
is
a
good
red
ale
better
than
the
regular
sa
red
a
malt
bomb
for
sure
but
not
as
deep
or
enjoyable
as
you
might
hope
came
in
the
spring
mixed
pack
this
to
me
is
a
english
style
beer
in
its
hops
and
its
malt
profile
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
vanilla
notes
didnt
really
add
to
the
mix
and
i
found
the
beer
a
little
one
dimensional
i
expected
more
from
the
description
of
the
beer
overall
this
brew
wasnt
really
my
thing
its
basically
an
amber
ale
with
a
little
vanilla
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
ol
boston
beer
company
on
this
one
nothing
really
stood
out
as
impressive
or
noteworthy
at
all
forgettable
the
finish
was
nice
the
oaky
and
nutty
subtlety
gave
this
beer
a
nice
ending
and
made
it
easier
to
go
back
in
for
another
drink
weve
been
somewhat
conditioned
to
expect
intense
flavors
from
a
bottle
with
oakaged
on
its
side
but
it
doesnt
always
have
to
be
that
way
oak
can
also
work
to
enhance
the
other
flavors
within
the
beer
without
getting
in
the
way
and
it
does
so
here
mighty
oak
would
be
a
little
better
if
the
base
brew
was
more
complex
but
its
a
drinkable
brew
regardless
o
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
seems
a
bit
off
no
recommended
there
are
better
reds
to
be
had
o
meh
not
terrible
but
definitely
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
a
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
best
from
the
seasonal
pack
ive
got
this
makes
the
sam
adams
red
ale
taste
like
budweiser
d
enjoyed
trying
it
first
of
a
seasonal
pack
so
i
will
be
reviewing
them
all
did
not
strike
me
at
all
as
an
american
amber
or
red
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
caramel
malt
character
is
predominant
with
some
rustic
husky
notes
hopping
is
mild
and
nondescript
slightly
woody
at
the
finish
but
that
may
just
be
the
power
of
suggestion
o
just
a
meh
beer
wouldnt
try
this
one
again
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
seemed
a
bit
thin
it
goes
down
really
easy
too
overall
not
too
bad
overall
this
was
nice
but
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
needs
a
drier
malt
flavor
or
a
more
complete
fermentation
the
aroma
is
fruit
raspberry
and
bread
the
appearance
is
medium
amber
and
very
clear
the
taste
is
raspberries
and
bread
with
a
malty
finish
the
fruit
and
bread
flavors
helped
make
this
an
above
average
amber
ale
easy
to
drink
and
will
try
this
again
this
beer
is
quite
timid
in
relation
to
its
moniker
the
oak
is
so
subdued
that
its
bareley
there
and
beyond
that
it
tastes
like
a
pedestrian
amber
i
think
they
played
it
a
bit
too
safe
on
this
one
but
good
for
them
for
taking
a
stab
at
a
nationally
marketed
oakedale
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
smooth
and
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
i
would
have
no
problem
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
red
ale
it
isnt
really
anything
exciting
but
it
is
just
a
nice
easily
drinkable
beer
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
oak
ale
id
say
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
id
drink
it
again
color
is
a
nice
amber
body
with
about
a
12
inch
of
opaque
colored
head
smell
is
very
sweet
mostly
caramel
and
toffee
but
i
am
getting
some
oak
and
vanilla
taste
makes
me
want
to
pick
up
another
but
not
pay
too
much
since
its
sweet
easy
to
drink
and
light
on
hops
or
overall
oak
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
easy
overall
i
would
get
it
again
if
under
10
bucks
or
found
a
case
for
typical
30
dollar
sam
adams
price
nothing
very
mighty
to
it
as
it
doesnt
pack
too
much
of
a
punch
flavorwise
but
as
a
light
spring
beer
its
not
bad
light
caramel
notes
play
off
a
bit
of
oaky
roastiness
giving
the
impression
of
oak
aging
the
roastiness
is
pleasant
and
easy
going
but
mild
mannered
to
match
the
slight
vanilla
notes
almost
effervescent
in
the
mouthfeel
and
it
leads
into
a
dry
finish
not
much
to
mention
on
the
hops
but
this
is
a
malt
heavy
beer
and
thats
ok
it
works
well
as
an
easy
drinker
one
to
sip
on
and
not
think
to
much
about
good
little
afternoon
beer
on
the
deck
on
a
cool
afternoon
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
though
but
worth
a
try
overall
easy
to
drink
this
beer
the
woody
tones
are
mild
but
definitely
builds
the
character
of
this
beer
enjoyable
but
it
will
not
blow
you
away
its
a
good
session
beer
mouthfeel
has
a
wonderfully
creamy
smooth
texture
really
something
to
be
enjoyed
overall
this
beer
isnt
objectively
bad
its
simply
really
not
to
my
taste
overly
sweet
caramel
segues
into
dryish
bitterness
without
segueing
through
tasty
eh
o
this
is
a
good
start
for
sam
adams
but
as
with
much
of
their
brews
i
would
never
purchase
a
6pack
of
this
brew
alone
12
oz
bottle
from
verity
pack
pours
red
with
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
grassy
hops
in
the
aroma
followed
by
caramel
malt
the
body
is
medium
and
crisp
caramel
malt
is
balanced
on
the
palate
by
earthy
hops
with
some
woody
fruity
and
sugary
notes
long
earthy
finish
nice
easy
drinking
amber
my
bottle
poured
a
clear
ruby
red
with
an
offwhite
head
in
short
this
tastes
like
an
adjunctfree
yuengling
that
is
to
say
its
a
smoother
red
ale
with
nothing
but
pale
and
caramel
barley
character
if
youre
used
to
massproduced
red
lagers
this
is
a
treat
but
i
find
it
kind
of
simple
for
a
craft
beer
theres
no
real
hops
character
but
the
malt
is
clean
and
clear
o
a
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
but
is
otherwise
unremarkable
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
enjoy
before
june
notched
on
the
label
pours
a
brownishamber
hue
with
a
translucent
clarity
and
a
loose
half
inch
creamcolored
head
some
thins
strands
of
lacing
coat
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
nose
is
pleasant
and
malty
with
toffee
and
some
buttery
notes
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
faint
metallic
quality
butter
comes
off
more
as
diacetyl
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
texture
overall
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
mind
blowing
but
decent
its
quite
a
looker
with
a
stunning
redamber
color
capped
with
a
sizeable
head
smells
fairly
similar
to
boston
lager
with
a
touch
of
oak
the
taste
is
solid
its
a
nice
amber
ale
with
a
solid
malty
presence
and
some
nice
vanilla
flavors
just
a
touch
of
oak
comes
in
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
solid
i
could
see
this
being
disappointing
if
youre
expecting
the
oak
but
its
a
good
tasting
beer
either
way
not
my
favorite
of
the
pack
but
the
oak
makes
this
one
more
pleasant
to
sip
than
a
classic
red
ale
would
have
o
this
is
a
new
one
from
sam
adams
that
tastes
pretty
good
but
is
not
overally
interesting
otherwise
would
not
mind
drinking
again
if
i
came
upon
it
in
the
future
overall
this
is
not
one
of
sam
adams
best
efforts
not
really
any
oak
to
speak
of
and
too
many
off
flavors
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brownish
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
and
toasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
and
some
lighter
fruit
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
the
same
with
a
small
amount
of
oak
which
is
almost
completely
masked
by
the
toffee
and
caramel
malt
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
above
average
but
not
something
i
could
drink
all
night
the
brew
is
well
made
and
meant
for
someone
who
enjoys
a
strong
oak
and
vanilla
flavor
that
someone
is
not
me
which
is
why
i
gave
it
only
a
slightly
above
average
rating
if
you
enjoy
those
two
flavors
then
give
this
beer
a
try
12oz
bottle
pours
bright
copper
with
a
gorgeous
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
holds
good
retention
and
leaves
sticky
lacing
all
over
the
glass
aromas
are
sweet
and
oaky
with
vanilla
caramel
creme
brulee
perhaps
tastes
are
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
upfront
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
oak
and
a
overly
strong
dose
of
vanilla
its
a
sweet
malty
mess
with
vanilla
to
boot
finishes
with
a
slight
herbal
hop
bite
with
more
sweet
vanilla
sticking
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
mediumtofull
bodied
and
smooth
overall
i
think
this
really
could
have
been
better
the
oak
aging
took
over
everything
and
were
left
with
a
vanilla
ale
that
is
rather
offputting
the
appearance
was
the
best
thing
about
this
one
it
seemed
to
be
all
downhill
from
there
still
one
of
the
worst
house
ale
yeasts
in
beer
oaky
yes
mighty
no
overall
a
very
pleasurable
brew
to
drink
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
really
good
cream
ale
the
taste
is
a
little
all
over
the
place
real
sweet
caramel
up
front
and
then
the
late
oak
finish
but
kind
of
a
watery
mush
in
between
texture
is
smooth
but
spineless
this
isnt
terrible
i
just
cant
see
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
some
buffed
up
hops
would
probably
improve
this
but
that
would
change
the
style
maybe
its
self
fulfilling
prophecy
but
i
feel
like
my
instincts
were
right
on
with
this
one
a
decent
amber
ale
but
no
real
oak
character
to
speak
of
i
really
loved
oaked
beers
but
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
one
glad
i
didnt
invest
in
the
whole
spring
mixed
pack
d
just
a
total
failure
on
this
one
ill
pass
in
the
future
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
really
good
i
really
liked
the
vanilla
flavor
in
it
it
was
very
well
balanced
o
i
think
this
red
ale
is
pretty
standard
in
that
nothing
is
wowing
about
it
and
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
think
the
flavors
are
very
balanced
and
i
really
liked
that
hint
of
cocoa
that
i
picked
up
in
the
taste
so
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
id
definitely
drink
again
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
nothing
groundbreaking
here
just
a
simple
plain
wellbalanced
red
ale
its
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
for
the
most
part
it
tastes
like
your
run
of
the
mill
amberred
ale
decent
beer
not
something
id
buy
a
6
pack
of
but
a
nice
addition
to
the
mixed
12
pack
o
this
doesnt
really
taste
like
there
was
any
oak
in
this
one
okay
but
not
what
the
bottle
advertises
pours
clear
dark
amber
tone
smells
of
spices
and
cherry
taste
is
very
cinnamon
spicy
with
some
rubbing
alcohol
aftertaste
a
bit
watery
thin
on
the
malty
side
but
enough
of
a
balance
with
the
spiciness
to
not
make
it
too
sweet
a
tad
bland
not
all
the
way
there
but
close
o
i
can
appreciate
the
effort
to
put
a
new
spin
on
the
style
but
it
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
something
i
would
seek
out
pretty
much
just
a
decent
amber
ale
the
mighty
oak
doesnt
make
a
mighty
difference
to
me
it
is
there
but
not
a
gamechanger
o
2
0
hoped
this
would
be
better
obviously
sometimes
the
tiny
explorer
inside
me
just
cant
resist
a
variety
pack
but
sometimes
with
sa
it
just
seems
like
im
getting
2
good
beers
for
the
price
of
12
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
nice
complex
character
taste
is
mild
up
front
with
a
malty
sweetness
on
the
palate
following
the
oak
flavor
is
subtle
very
subtle
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
not
one
id
pursue
further
either
pours
a
deep
copper
with
foamy
beige
head
head
lasts
a
fair
amount
of
time
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
grassy
vanilla
not
woody
or
whiskey
barrel
taste
is
creamy
vanilla
sweetish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
tangy
quite
enjoyable
mighty
oak
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
although
the
the
malt
and
wood
profiles
are
both
noticeable
neither
is
especially
powerful
i
like
this
beer
because
it
is
the
type
of
thing
i
ran
into
at
a
party
and
was
able
to
enjoy
and
hopefully
it
will
introduce
casual
beer
drinkers
to
woodaged
beers
also
its
nice
to
taste
barrelcharacteristics
and
hops
in
the
same
beer
which
is
rare
even
rarer
however
is
that
mighty
oak
doesnt
need
to
be
boozy
to
pull
this
off
a
great
stab
at
the
whole
fresh
barrel
aged
beer
movement
this
direction
id
love
to
see
from
more
brewers
as
for
mighty
oak
its
a
good
start
the
oak
does
come
around
and
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
more
dry
would
work
for
me
kind
of
an
odd
beer
wouldve
expected
a
hoppier
aroma
and
a
bit
more
malt
presence
in
the
flavor
overall
another
solid
product
from
sam
adams
brewers
choice
pack
very
impressed
makes
up
for
winter
fails
has
pretty
good
flavor
i
like
the
finishing
cherry
flavor
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
reds
but
this
is
less
sweet
than
most
with
a
mildly
smoky
allusion
overall
its
a
pretty
inoffensive
beer
on
all
levels
o
overall
this
one
didnt
do
anything
for
me
it
was
just
kind
of
bland
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
o
a
solid
offering
the
vanilla
oak
sweetness
is
not
overbearing
or
cloying
and
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
a
touch
of
back
of
the
tongue
bitterness
some
additional
hop
balance
and
carbonation
would
bring
this
beer
up
a
notch
deep
reddened
copper
color
with
a
small
soapy
head
nice
sheets
of
lacing
aside
from
the
typical
sam
adams
yeast
character
the
aroma
features
mild
spicy
woody
notes
soft
fruits
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
malty
sweet
flavor
a
fair
amount
of
fresh
grain
oak
and
toffee
simple
and
clean
nothing
to
get
excited
about
if
it
were
available
in
sixpacks
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
pick
one
up
not
bad
just
nothing
special
im
not
a
fan
of
ambers
and
this
reminded
me
of
one
except
for
the
slightly
oakd
taste
nothing
special
with
this
beer
quality
is
typical
of
a
samuel
adams
beer
good
packaging
and
labeling
id
would
have
preferred
a
stronger
oak
taste
worth
a
try
but
id
limit
it
to
a
six
pack
taste
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
fruity
flavors
picking
up
a
blend
of
oak
and
vanilla
carbonation
gives
it
a
nice
crisp
feeling
and
is
refreshing
still
the
combination
of
everything
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
together
some
aspects
playing
tug
of
war
with
no
one
winning
in
the
end
o
i
was
looking
more
forward
to
this
one
than
any
of
the
others
in
the
mix
pack
and
i
guess
i
was
letdown
in
epic
fashion
pours
a
light
amber
color
creamy
off
white
foam
forms
and
eventually
disappears
strong
caramel
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
vanilla
in
the
taste
caramel
and
munich
malts
stand
out
oak
flavor
lends
some
dryness
and
noticeable
tannins
light
vanilla
nutty
and
brown
sugar
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
prolonged
drying
finish
showing
the
barrel
wood
chip
influence
overall
an
approachable
oak
aged
brown
ale
gets
better
with
each
sip
pros
loys
of
vanilla
flavor
from
the
oak
obviously
really
nice
red
dapple
color
to
the
body
and
a
decent
head
cons
if
the
oak
was
left
out
this
would
have
been
a
light
red
ale
like
killians
quality
its
all
oak
favor
and
no
body
overall
flavor
is
weak
very
disappointing
could
barley
finish
this
is
very
average
its
fine
as
part
of
a
bargain
12pack
only
12

but
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
looking
forward
to
trying
the
whitewater
ipa
next
go
pats
o
a
nice
red
ale
that
is
aged
very
nicely
in
oak
you
still
get
that
red
ale
base
that
is
only
complimented
by
the
oak
not
too
grainy
like
a
lot
of
red
ales
that
i
seem
to
dislike
another
fine
but
less
than
stellar
ale
from
the
boston
beer
company
when
needing
a
beer
for
that
maltfix
this
is
a
good
goto
choice
the
wood
character
is
terse
and
is
easily
overlooked
while
the
lack
of
balance
keeps
the
beer
onedimensional
i
do
appreciate
the
focus
on
malt
and
complementary
wood
notes
simply
a
timid
beer
overall
just
ok
nothing
about
this
beer
really
blew
me
away
simple
flavor
and
a
little
boring
opinion
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
between
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
i
was
expecting
quite
a
bit
more
deliverance
in
the
flavor
but
it
ended
up
being
a
well
attenuated
version
of
what
i
was
expecting
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
light
on
the
palate
and
pretty
drinkable
but
not
one
i
would
come
back
to
unless
it
was
like
the
only
beer
on
tap
at
a
pizza
joint
then
i
would
probably
take
it
over
iced
tea
or
something
nonbeer
like

it

syrupy
nice
toasty

overall
not

cloying
in

really
no
personality
to
this
beer
a
bit

sweet
and
no
noticable

from
a

this
beer
is
a
brownish
burnt

slim

the

it

nutty
earthy

restrained
hops
there
is
a
touch

it
comes

more
in

slight

but
otherwise
very
clean
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
with
generous
malt
flavors
full
in
body
nice
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
style
i
dont
often
drink
overall
its
not
that
impressive
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
beers
in
the
sampler
pack
interesting
and
worth
a
try
oda
mellow
drink
i
would
rather
have
a
beer
like
this
mild
than
a
gross
overexaggeration
with
the
oak
a
simple
drink
i
guess
its
worth
a
try
i
had
this
beer
a
couple
weeks
ago
in
the
sam
adams
sampler
pack
and
decided
to
get
another
sampler
pack
and
give
all
of
them
a
try
again
to
be
honest
i
think
this
beer
grows
on
you
and
is
actually
pretty
good
overall
the
look
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
red
ale
amber
brownish
in
color
and
pretty
clean
looking
the
main
thing
i
get
from
the
nose
is
faint
vanilla
and
possibly
some
light
oak
aging
and
perhaps
the
smell
of
light
fresh
bread
taste
to
me
is
pretty
good
the
beer
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
lots
of
malt
with
a
lingering
vanilla
taste
that
follows
to
an
oaky
type
taste
the
oak
taste
in
this
beer
does
not
taste
like
old
oak
barrels
or
anything
like
that
its
more
like
fresh
cut
wood
thats
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
carbonation
is
good
liked
this
beer
much
more
the
second
time
trying
it
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
average
beer
and
as
far
as
amber
and
red
ales
go
this
one
wasnt
that
memorable
the
flavors
just
seemed
to
be
bland
and
with
a
name
like
mighty
oak
i
expected
a
distinctive
oak
presence
like
what
was
claimed
on
the
bottle
but
there
was
hardly
any
to
be
found
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
pretty
good
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
blandness
of
the
aroma
and
taste
and
the
lack
of
oak
flavor
in
this
beer
it
just
didnt
meet
my
expectations
this
beer
did
have
some
good
drinkability
the
smoothness
and
lighter
flavors
made
this
beer
go
down
quickly
but
it
just
didnt
have
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
starter
beer
for
someone
wanting
to
get
into
oaked
beers
but
if
you
have
a
some
experience
with
oaked
ales
you
may
find
this
beer
underwhelming
like
i
did
samuel
adams
can
make
some
solid
beers
but
this
one
fell
short
when
it
came
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
with
a
name
like
mighty
oak
i
expected
a
pretty
big
oak
presence
and
that
is
not
what
i
got
better
luck
next
time
samuel
adams
i
dont
really
care
for
this
the
flavor
mix
overall
presentation
are
just
very
bland
with
cloying
sweetness
really
bringing
this
down
not
one
i
would
buy
again
the
flavors
seem
fake
to
me
overall
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
reminds
me
of
bass
ale
sessionable
the
oak
character
is
much
less
prominent
than
what
id
expect
o
another
impressive
offering
from
boston
beer
in
this
what
i
believe
to
be
their
best
mix
pack
yet
after
sipping
this
and
checking
boston
brewings
profile
of
this
beer
it
would
seem
like
my
tastetake

with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
with
minimal
lace
smell
is
very
malty
carmel
vanilla
and
a
some

is
that
with

with
a
some

in
the
finish
body
is
average
not
much
life
easy
drinking
and
not

this
is
a
nice
beer
reminds
me
of
what
octoberfest
would
taste
like
of
it
was
aged
on
oak
chips
a
tasty
brew
i
cant
see
myself
going
back
to
this
one
but
a
real
change
of
pace
for
these
guys
very
drinkable
yet
interesting
amber
my
candid
advice
to
you
is
to
drink
this
one
at
or
near
room
temperature
it
really
brings
out
the
flavor
and
makes
it
a
bit
more
creamy
as
an
ale
should
be
other
reviews
have
it
pegged
its
not
a
stout
by
any
means
dont
be
fooled
by
the
name
but
as
a
light
ale
it
does
pretty
reasonably
at
room
temperature
cold
the
flavor
is
quite
masked
o
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
to
make
it
a
session
beer
however
it
is
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
reddishamber
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
haze
malty
aromas
of
biscuit
malt
and
caramel
dominate
with
some
piney
hops
and
a
touch
of
oak
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
very
malty
with
plenty
of
caramel
biscuit
and
buttered
toast
with
a
noticeable
woody
finish
that
imparts
delicate
vanilla
and
oak
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
mediumthin
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
approachable
drinkable
brew
overall
severely
disappointed
this
may
be
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
from
sam
adams
if
you
put
me
up
in
a
blind
taste
test
between
this
and
budweiser
american
ale
itd
be
blind
luck
if
i
got
it
right
this
beer
tastes
like
someone
blended
a
red
ale
with
franziskaner
hefeweisse
dunkel
eh
i
was
expecting
more
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
the
caramel
and
vanilla
are
a
little
intense
and
sweet
its
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
mix
pack
however
o
overall
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinker
not
sure
where
to
categorize
it
but
its
sort
of
brown
alelike
with
less
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
ive
seen
some
posters
talk
about
heavy
and
offputting
oak
character
but
this
is
far
more
mellow
than
many
oakaged
beers
out
there
a
delicious
brown
ale
thats
what
this
beer
feels
like
to
me
that
i
was
actually
looking
forward
to
the
most
in
the
pack
while
it
doesnt
deserve
the
name

this

nothing

a

also

a

with

this

is

but
this
one
frankly
disappoints
overall
a
rather
easy

style
brew
it
starts
sweeter
and
end
with
a
just
enough
hop
and
spice
to
add
a

a

amber

not
my
favorite
rendition
of
an

beer
aside
from
the
harshness
in

this
was
a
fairly
desent
beer
very

like
this
is
a

nothing
unique
that
makes
it
stand
out
the

mostly
caramel

with

with
a
slight

the
flavor
of

is

not

overall
i
liked
this
okay
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of

would
probably
not
buy

again
if
you
hand
me
one

it

weyerbacher
autumn
fest
is
an
average
beer
a
bit
odd
but
not
bad
recommended
drank
this
with
the
impression
that
it
was
an
oktoberfest
fit
the
bill
as
much
as
it
does
a
red
ale
a
really
decent
amber
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
would
drink
another
this
is
a
pretty
simplistic
malty
beer
the
hops
are
there
theyre
balanced
and
bitter
but
the
malts
dominate
the
grainy
notes
are
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
on
the
whole
this
beer
is
underwhelming
and
ultimately
forgettable
autumnfest
is
nothing
special
which
is
probably
why
i
usually
skip
it
every
year
the
new
labels
neat
its
okay
but
if
this
is
one
of
your
favorite
weyerbacher
beers
youve
got
problems
pick
this
one
up
if
you
want
sessionable
autumn
beer
but
want
something
other
than
a
pumpkin
ale
or
a
true
oktoberfest
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
amber
while
not
quite
an
oktoberfest
it
is
listed
as
a
red
amber
ale
and
at
that
it
has
succeeded
overall
well
done
overall
and
decent
seasonal
pretty
good
for
a
nice
fall
day
pours
a
clear
amber
with
little
head
retention
or
lacing
caramel
malt
aromas
followed
by
some
spice
and
hints
of
citrus
light
in
body
and
emphatically
carbonated
while
the
carbonation
and
light
body
are
nice
the
flavor
profile
fell
a
little
flat
there
was
not
much
there
beyond
a
slight
maltiness
clean
finish
this
brew
pours
a
clear
reddish
color
with
visible
carbonation
the
head
on
the
brew
pours
a
white
color
but
dissipates
very
quickly
with
no
lacing
on
the
nose
i
get
some
spices
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
some
malts
there
is
also
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
going
on
with
the
nose
on
the
taste
the
caramel
notes
come
out
first
then
the
spices
come
out
after
well
the
carbonation
dances
on
the
tongue
and
is
quite
active
and
nice
i
would
call
this
a
spiced
amber
style
it
has
a
bit
more
complexity
than
the
normal
amber
i
could
see
why
they
call
this
a
good
transition
beer
its
lighter
than
a
typical
autumn
beer
which
is
nice
the
spice
is
subtle
and
not
overwhelming
the
finish
is
pretty
quick
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
orangishred
with
yellow
hues
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
hazy
poured
with
a
short
off
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
sweet
toasted
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
earthy
grass
and
lemon
hops
pleasant
smooth
delicate
lager
feel
with
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
toasted
and
caramel
malt
flavors
up
front
ans
through
the
middle
with
earthy
grassy
undertones
light
lemon
citrus
hop
bitterness
toward
the
end
ushers
in
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
fall
brew
thick
and
rich
for
those
cool
fall
nights
along
with
a
slight
alchohol
warming
effect
the
thick
bready
malts
fill
one
up
and
the
fall
fruits
such
as
apples
and
pears
along
with
a
touch
of
cinammon
add
a
nice
touch
overall
a
great
fall
beer
and
another
great
beer
from
weyerbacher
if
you
rated
to
low
i
would
reconsider
a
revisit
new
label
since
its
fantastic
drink
ability
it
may
be
ironic
that
i
am
drinking
this
in
early
june
but
a
good
beer
is
good
any
time
of
year
mild
malty
aroma
has
hints
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
it
pours
a
clear
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
malty
flavor
has
subtle
notes
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
and
a
woody
hint
texture
is
smooth
with
average
body
and
average
fizz
maybe
its
been
languishing
on
the
shelf
a
while
but
im
confident
this
is
better
when
fresh
might
be
worth
a
revisit
overall
a
good
amber
marzen
msmooth
and
clean
i
would
def
buy
again
but
more
as
a
nice
seasonal
beer
to
session
with
friends
ofor
a
malty
fall
beer
it
isnt
half
bad
pales
in
comparison
to
their
other
fall
seasonal
pumpkin
ale

this

this
was
a

drink
but
nothing
id
stress
too
hard
to
get
o
itd
be
a
solid
a
or
b
but
that
funky
metallic
flavor
really
gets
me
even
though
i
only
had
one
of
these
this
offering
could
easily
have
been
part
of
a
larger
drinking
session
had
i
had
the
time
this
style
isnt
what
i
would
expect
for
an
autumn
seasonal
but
this
fit
the
bill
nicely
and
wasnt
weak
like
some
of
the
marzens
that
ive
had
most
ambers
tend
to
be
quite
hoppy
but
for
a
wellbalanced
alternative
this
would
be
a
great
choice
o
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
an
easy
drinker
o
i
think
weyerbacher
has
done
a
fine
job
with
this
beer
its
a
little
lighter
on
flavor
and
body
than
i
prefer
with
amber
ales
but
definitely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
3

this
is
a
great
fester
do
it
overall
a
average
ale
not
the
best
of
the
weyerbacher
fleet
of
beer
enjoy
on
a
nice
fall
football
day
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
body
very
little
head
that
disaptes
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
has
a
some
malty
aroma
and
some
floral
hop
the
taste
if
carmel
and
has
some
grapey
flavor
with
some
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
amber
ale
but
close
to
it
o
pretty
standard
amber
ale
but
to
a
man
who
was
raised
on
hopback
and
nugget
nectar
it
falls
short
but
that
really
isnt
a
fair
comparison
pours
a
reddish
caramel
a
healthy
offwhite
head
retains
well
and
laces
weakly
nose
is
caramel
slight
roastiness
im
getting
just
a
hint
of
popcorn
a
slight
floral
hoppiness
taste
is
caramel
slight
grapey
sweetness
lightly
roasted
malts
bready
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonated
well
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
drink
flavors
are
interesting
and
blend
well
sweet
lightly
roasted
and
bready
i
would
get
this
beer
again
o
weyerbacher
makes
some
really
good
beers
this
their
autumn
fest
isnt
one
of
them
very
nice
poured
amber
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
toasted
grains
and
lots
of
sweetness
bready
taste
caramel
and
i
got
lots
of
honey
from
it
too
some
fruity
tones
as
well
lots
of
sweetness
like
i
said
but
theres
still
a
nice
floral
hoppiness
that
come
in
mid
to
endpalate
medium
body
and
very
easily
drinkable
a
boring
offering
by
an
otherwise
excellent
brewery
pours
a
copper
body
with
a
small
head
with
poor
retention
aromas
are
predominantly
toasty
with
some
wet
pavement
and
earthy
notes
flavors
are
solidly
toasty
from
beginning
to
end
with
a
dash
of
toffee
as
it
transitions
from
mid
to
back
palate
the
taste
is
good
but
uninteresting
this
first
bottle
is
probably
my
last
very
good
easy
to
drink
fall
seasonal
offering
these
days
it
seems
that
all
craft
breweries
are
making
pumpkin
beers
andor
oktoberfest
offerings
and
true
autumn
selections
are
getting
harder
to
come
by
great
nose
of
toasted
malt
and
drinks
incredibly
smooth
the
ratings
so
far
on
this
have
been
way
too
low
and
i
think
that
its
lower
alcohol
may
factor
in
those
scores
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
weyerbacker
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
now
only
if
they
will
do
something
about
their
labels
mo
crisp
and
drinkable
and
not
too
heavy
the
beer
isnt
overwhelming
in
any
category
but
it
is
a
solid
autumn
beer
overall
not
complex
by
any
means
but
the
combination
of
malts
is
wonderful
slight
roastiness
but
no
bitter
harshness
o
weyerbachers
fall
seasonal
is
an
ale
rather
than
a
marzen
type
lager
since
it
is
an
ale
i
was
expecting
a
variety
of
flavors
by
nature
ales
often
have
more
flavors
than
a
lager
while
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
profile
in
this
beer
is
not
very
full
there
is
some
nutty
flavor
and
there
are
grainy
oats
in
the
finish
which
does
work
well
with
fall
the
real
strength
of
this
beer
is
its
appearance
it
really
catches
the
light
well
however
that
is
not
enough
to
separate
autumn
fest
from
the
large
amount
of
fall
seasonal
offerings
pours
a
dark
amber
w
only
a
sliver
of
a
cocoa
head
very
little
carbonation
or
lacing
at
all
still
this
is
a
nice
looking
beer
just
not
quite
there
nose
is
toasted
malt
some
fruit
grain
and
really
thats
about
it
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malt
and
a
touch
of
honey
very
one
dimensional
and
sort
of
a
let
down
feel
is
carbonated
syruplike
and
fairly
mediocre
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
mediocre
brew
from
a
brewery
that
makes
really
good
beers
kind
of
a
let
down
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
of
the
style
it
was
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
and
pretty
nice
overall
this
beer
lets
you
figure
it
out
its
got
just
the
right
body
for
the
season
and
all
the
flavors
without
any
one
flavor
dominating
this
is
my
favorite
weyerbacher
brew
samuel
adams
oktoberfest
is
sweeter
than
this
where
this
has
more
of
a
fruity
raw
a
touch
more
bitter
taste
i
think
i
like
this
better
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
medium
not
too
heavy
at
all
but
really
makes
for
an
excellent
malty
beer
with
an
added
fruity
earthy
hop
character
poured
with
a
smallish
sized
off
white
head
that
soon
settled
down
to
about
23
light
cover
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
red
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
caramel
toffee
fruit
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
and
is
dominated
by
the
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
tang
for
some
balance
body
is
ok
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
average
length
workaday
beer
the
body
is
medium
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
for
it
lightly
crisp
with
a
nice
smooth
feel
all
the
way
through
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
as
the
weather
turns
cooler
o
this
is
a
good
beer
i
rather
liked
it
and
would
recommend
it
shame
it
is
only
seasonal
o
this
is
a
fairly
solid
beer
im
a
fan
of
weyerbacher
but
i
took
a
pass
at
this
every
year
at
the
beer
store
instead
of
the
million
different
pumpkin
ales
coming
out
this
looked
like
the
better
choice
at
the
beer
store
this
isnt
a
mind
blowing
beer
by
any
means
but
a
good
beer
to
have
around
the
fridge
during
the
fall
same
for
the
winter
ale
drinkabilityoverall
overall
from
a
brewery
that
i
really
do
love
and
run
by
great
people
this
is
probably
there
weakest
of
there
line
i
have
tried
its
in
offensive
it
just
sort
misses
the
spot
and
is
a
little
light
and
bland
could
be
easily
drank
and
sessioned
but
real
just
nothing
incredible
its
trys
to
almost
be
an
octoberfest
beer
but
lacks
the
malt
back
bone
or
the
real
interest
other
wise
to
be
and
interesting
amber
ale
o
not
bad
could
probably
have
a
few
on
a
fall
day
but
not
very
memorable
also
unless
this
bottle
is
just
way
past
its
prime
theres
no
way
this
is
an
amber
ale
much
closer
to
a
marzen
which
would
make
more
sense
given
its
autumn
title
decent
little
sessionable
brew
here
this
was
very
good
ive
had
several
octoberfest
style
beers
that
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
but
this
was
a
winner
great
flavor
of
spices
and
all
around
well
balanced
beer
the
color
was
a
reddish
brown
that
fit
for
the
season
the
aromas
were
spicy
and
earthy
it
had
a
good
taste
too
this
ones
flavor
was
of
some
allspice
and
some
nutmeg
the
malts
balance
the
brew
out
a
bit
so
its
not
just
a
spicy
mess
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
season
d
this
one
is
good
tasty
and
think
my
bottle
may
have
suffered
some
trauma
somewhere
earning
its
flat
character
but
still
a
good
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
with
some
room
for
improvement
i
could
certainly
have
another
or
even
a
couple
at
a
bar
but
that
intangible
quality
that
makes
a
great
beer
is
just
missing
overall
next
autumn
ill
definitely
be
seeking
out
this
one
i
enjoyed
this
ale
it
is
balanced
overall
and
works
perfectly
for
a
festbier
ale
wise
it
would
be
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
on
an
autumn
evening
overall
this
beer
starts
out
promising
it
really
looks
like
fall
unfortunatly
its
falls
off
from
there
the
aroma
is
very
bland
as
is
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
makes
up
for
it
a
bit
as
does
the
drinkability
so
youre
pretty
much
left
with
an
unexciting
easily
sessionable
octoberfest
i
though
this
was
a
pretty
average
beer
the
flavor
was
decent
but
i
thought
it
was
too
thin
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
but
i
wouldt
necessarily
look
for
it
d
solid
drinkable
amber
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
very
easygoing
d
this
is
a
nice
version
of
the
marzen
style
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
breadier
than
most
d
autumnfest
goes
down
easy
a
little
light
in
flavor
for
my
tastes
but
the
perfect
start
to
a
session
a
really
good
ale
apparently
i
thought
it
was
more
like
a
marzen
still
tasty
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hop
slight
clove
flowers
and
subtle
nutmeg
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
another
smooth
beer
goes
down
the
hatch
this
one
really
did
have
a
pretty
good
flavor
and
aroma
to
it
as
this
brew
warmed
up
it
actually
seemed
to
get
a
little
bit
better
in
my
experience
worth
trying
for
sure
theres
a
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
and
a
little
bot
of
spice
cloves
that
leave
a
phenolic
feel
to
the
beer
this
is
a
little
unpleasant
and
ruins
the
overall
experience
and
makes
it
difficult
to
want
to
open
another
one
this
is
a
tasty
beer
very
refreshing
and
pretty
well
put
together
drinkability
an
above
average
malty
red
ale
i
do
like
the
additional
small
kick
of
spice
that
being
said
i
do
not
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
hunt
this
down
im
pretty
sure
this
beer
should
qualify
for
the

defined
as

bread

in
for
a
second
plenty
of
gingerbread
especially
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
subtly
sweet
red
ale
that
acts
as
a
light
session
beer
for
the
fall
afternoon
db
the
thing
that
starts
to
bother
me
here
is
the
cherry
mixed
with
the
hops
and
slight
spice
makes
it
tastes
a
bit
medicinal
it
has
a
nice
flavor
especially
the
bready
malt
finish
but
nothing
to
go
out
and
search
for
dwell
balanced
and
strong
hop
presence
with
a
classic
malt
body
slight
metallic
phenol
in
the
back
draws
away
slightly
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
messy
in
the
back
solid
beer
not
great
but
decent
very
easy
drinking
can
certainly
have
several
d
tasty
and
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
and
with
the
abv
you
can
have
a
few
d
more
reminiscent
of
a
marzen
than
an
american
red
mildly
satisfying
but
rather
mundane
i
would
likely
be
able
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
ever
becoming
truly
satisfied
theres
nothing
offputting
in
any
way
shape
or
form
bu
theres
nothing
remarkable
or
even
memorable

a

also
when

flavor
seems
to
peak
why
one
site
says
red

and
other
sites
call
it
a
märzenoctoberfest
one
thing
for
sure
it
does
taste
like
autumn
very
drinkable
damn
it
i
only
have
one
this
is
a
dencent
interpretation
of
a
traditional
lagerale
hybrid
autumn
offering
the
fruity
qualities
actually
mix
with
the
traditional
oktoberfest
flavors
quite
well
but
the
overall
flavor
quality
is
limited
if
this
ale
is
trying
to
taste
like
a
lager
it
succeeds
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
just
wish
it
was
a
little
more
complex
the
nose
detects
a
subtle
whiff
of
caramel
and
apple
while
the
palate
is
hit
with
a
slight
tinge
of
malt
with
a
sweet
alcohol
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
airy
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
i
dont
get
too
much
of
the
weyerbacher
brands
but
i
have
enjoyed
those
i
did
all
in
all
this
brew
sucks
nothing
special
going
on
this
needs
more
flavor
to
it
way
to
much
water
on
this
one
my
advice
do
not
bother
hunting
this
one
down
not
much
to
offer
d
yum
a
well
crafted
seasonal
id
drink
another
and

flavor
is
also
quite
sweet
with

dark

caramel
raisins
prunes
this
is
just
too
sweet
and
sugary
for
me
and
hard
to
get
through

this
is
the
last
bottle
for
this
year
while
not
the
top
of
the
heap
of
autumn
seasonal
beer
it
is
a
standard
and
standby
that
i
always
return
to
poured
to
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
nice
off
white
head
that
lingers
well
and
leaves
good
lacing
nose
and
mouth
were
both
faint
but
what
was
present
was
a
nice
blend
of
malty
dark
fruit
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
caramel
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasant
finish
while
nothing
strong
stuck
out
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
whose
head
quickly
disappears
with
minor
lacing
nice
smooth
taste
with
hints
of
toffee
most
of
the
underlying
flavors
are
very
subtle
very
low

makes
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
one
of
the
better
harvest
ales
out
there
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
pleasant
clear
amber
with
a
decent
2
finger
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
bready
and
spicy
the
flavor
follows
the
spicy
sweet
finish
lingers
in
between
sips
the
brew
is
well
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
medium
body
this
is
a
very
good
fest
beeri
know
it
is
an
ale
but
i
graded
it
as
a
fest
beer
drinkability
despite
the
mild
flavor
profile
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
quaff
i
had
two
pints
and
probably
could
have
had
some
more
d
enjoyable
but
not
great
i
would
drink
another
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
honeyed
a
bit
tangy
in
parts
with
a
touch
of
lemony
sharpness
decent
carbonation
some
hop
notes
in
the
finish
that
get
buried
behind
the
sweetish
roasted
crystal
malts
and
a
touch
of
toffee
this
is
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
smoothly
not
much
aftertaste
nothing
overly
complex
going
on
but
a
good
beer
nevertheless
d
a
decidedly
forgettable
beer
not
totally
undrinkable
just
not
all
that
interesting
perfect
offering
for
the
season
one
of
the
more
original
brews
ive
tasted
from
wyerbacher
cheers
very
average
brew
which
is
not
at
all
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
weyerbacher
well
no
one
is
perfect
right
aroma
is
primarily
malt
no
spice
or
hop
character
to
speak
of
you
can
smell
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
beer
is
full
bodied
has
an
aftertaste
seem
like
a
heavy
lager
almost
does
not
taste
bad
interesting
malt
character
in
the
forward
and
back
flavors
no

d
good
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
when
i
had
it
i
thoughtassumed
it
was
an
octoberfest
not
a
amberred
ale
it
was
solid
non
the
less
this
beer
pours
copperamber
color
with
a
14
inch
of
off
white
head
that
quickly
receded
some
spotty
lacing
left
on
the
glass
nose
on
this
was
mild
though
predominantly
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malts
in
the
forefront
with
the
middle
more
grainy
and
bready
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
floral
hop
bite
and
a
hint
of
apples
light
to
medium
body
medium
carbonation
crisp
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
easily
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
however
is
still
quite
drinkable
anyhow
the
weyerbacher
was
nothing
special
somewhat
foggy
amber
tone
with
a
slightly
bitter
tang
in
the
aroma
mixed
with
a
nice
malty
waft
with
a
touch
of
charred
cloves
medium
body
that
felt
rather
flat
flavors
of
citrus
cloves
a
bit
of
toast
and
some
apples
it
had
an
autumnal
feel
to
it
bu
overall
was
mediocre
feh
you
can
easily
do
better
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
cooper
tone
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
maintains
a
slight
milky
head
after
the
intial
pour
the
beer
has
an
aroma
of
dried
fruit
more
specifically
prunes
taste
is
quite
mellow
with
sweet
malty
flavor
that
lingers
after
each
sip
i
noticed
very
little
carbination
and
it
seems
almost
flat
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
has
a
smooth
sweet
flavor
that
is
an
interseting
interpretation
of
an
autumn
beer
but
i
would
seek
something
a
little
less
sweet
next
trip
to
the
store
drink
is
ok
nothing
great
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
worth
searching
out
but
maybe
a
taster
if
you
havent
seen
it
around
d
this
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again

added
to
by
a

kind
of
freshness
at
the

time
theres
a
dry

as
well
not
enough
for
tackiness
but
evident
as
theres
minimal

flavors
retains
its
quiet
profile
nothing
sticks
out
to
either
annoy
you
or
tickle
your
fancy
in
the
end
you
wish
it
would
take
a
more
decisive
position
now
and
then
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
bier
i
have
heard
great
things
about
this
brewery
but
this
is
not
a
good
intro
to
them
if
your
friends
have
it
in
their
fridge
have
it
because
it
will
be
free
but
dont
bother
paying
for
it
final
thoughts
until
this
beer
i
was
a
big
fan
of
weyerbacher
this
beer
alone
has
made
me
think
twice
about
that
its
like
a
fake
version
of
a
fireside
or
bad
autumnfest
pretty
sweet
artificial
flavors
almost
a
drain
pour
wait
i
think
it
is
a
drain
pour
meh
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
malts
with
some
sweetness
tastes
a
bit
malty
with
a
dry
finish
pleasent
and
refreshing
feels
o
k
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
and
appears
a
scarlet
redbrown
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
light
tan
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
and
tastes
of
light
caramel
malt
biscuits
and
a
touch
of
molasses
a
notch
below
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
picked
up
a
single
of
this
at
greens
on
ponce
pours
a
redamber
color
with
very
little
head
or
lacing
on
the
glass
bready
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
taste
is
pretty
average
malty
bready
and
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
relatively
low
abv
make
this
pretty
drinkable
average
at
best
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
some
vanilla
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
toasted
malt
with
toffee
and
some
of
the
vanilla
in
the
nose
that
gives
way
to
a
tiny
hint
of
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
nonagressive
carbonation
this
is
tasty
little
beer
that
has
really
impressed
me
for
the
price
i
found
it
for
orange
hue
plenty
of
carbonation
that
keeps
a
nice
layer
of
head
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
malty
with
notes
of
grass
taste
is
slightly
bitter
up
front
then
trickles
into
a
sweetness
then
back
to
a
strong
bitter
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamier
than
i
would
have
expected
especially
from
a
growler
pour
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
yielded
and
very
nice
good
drinking
fall
beer
an
excellent
malt
backbone
made
for
a
very
good
beer
overall
in
the
end
it
was
just
another
simple
crispy
toasted
ale
but
what
separates
this
one
from
the
others
is
that
this
beer
has
a
dead
alien
or
a
mummy
on
the
label
was
it
a
fall
treat
i
guess
but
one
should
do
the
trick
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
because
theres
really
nothing
to
this
beer
its
just
an
average
beer
the
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
with
an
esb
type
of
yeast
that
gives
it
a
nutty
and
funky
twang
there
is
also
a
hint
of
hops
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
pleasant
looking
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
which
isnt
actually
all
that
bad
the
palate
is
smooth
but
a
little
thin
overall
its
decent
d
meh
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
too
bland
and
tasteless
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
one
again

the
nose
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
redish
copper
color
the
beer
poured
a
nice
big
head
that
was
white
and
i
had
high
hopes
the
beer
was
kinda
sweet
and
bready
however
it
really
lacked
any
body
and
was
watery
fake
tasteing
i
will
not
buy
again
pours
a
rich
copper
with
dense
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
biscuity
like
the
smell
of
dry
autumn
leaves
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
malty

pumpkiny
with
a
nice
burn
down
the
throat
the
mouthfeel

smooth

an
interesting

of
a
traditional

the
fruity
qualities
actually
mix
with
the
traditional
oktoberfest
flavors
quite
well
forming
a
whole
host
of
seasonal
tastes
in
one
bottle
flavor
masks
the
abv
well
making
this
an
easy
one
to
enjoy
over
the
course
of
several
pints
overall
an
extremely
enjoyable
celebration
of
the
changing
of
seasons
d
i
had
a
few
with
my
meal
a
decent
sessionable
ale
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
head
sticking
to
the
glass
for
just
a
little
bit
this
beer
is
properly
labeled
as
an
amber
ale
and
not
an
oktoberfest
as
the
malt
presence
is
definetly
not
the
same
that
being
said
this
beer
still
tastes
of
autumn
apple
and
plum
notes
are
found
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
malt
and
hop
charactersitics
balance
really
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
low
alcohol
make
this
a
great
fall
session
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
smells
nutty
with
some
breadycaramel
background
taste
is
weak
almost
watered
down
no
hops
here
like
drinking
a
soggy

good
carbonation
thruout
cant
say
i
enjoyed
cant
say
i
hated
it
im
just
stuck
in
the
middle
serving
type
bottle
d
this
will
be
gone
fairly
soon
but
i
doubt
ill
necessarily
grab
another
anytime
soon
not
worth
a
second
try
kinda
like
an
oktoberfest
apple
cider
too
sweet
to
drink
many
more
than
one
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
easily
drinkable
but
probably
not
my
first
or
second
choice
when
grabbing
a
fest
beer
in
the
fall
d
notes
a
nice
sessionable
red
ale
for
the
fall
d
this
is
easily
drinkable
as
all
fest
beers
should
be
though
the
malt
character
lacks
the
depth
and
richness
of
some
other
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
this
is
where
weyerbacher
shined
with
this
excellent
drinkability
very
light
on
the
pallete
yet
still
delivers
a
solid
offering
at
6
10
abv
this
is
a
little
more
instrumental
then
alot
of
other
selections
out
there
but
overall
its
very
sessionable
and
a
perfect
match
to
those
cold
weather
evenings
d
very
drinkable
amber
ale
and
the
spices
make
this
a
great
fall
classic
well
worthy
of
a
try
amber
orange
in
color
with
a
thin
head
and
spotty
lacing
lower
carbonation
smell
is
fairly
light
toasted
bready
malts
and
light
sweetness
not
much
to
say
for
hops
except
for
an
herbal
earthy
quality
that
they
bring
to
the
brew
taste
is
also
big
on
the
light
toasted
malts
a
small
touch
of
chocolate
comes
through
also
a
tea
like
quality
pretty
thin
feeling
in
the
mouth
lacking
in
carbonation
and
perhaps
a
touch
more
hop
character
i
can
see
how
this
is
something
like
an
oktoberfest
brew
and
moving
toward
an
amber
its
nothing
terrible
and
pretty
interesting
though
i
doubt
its
one
ill
return
to
often
quite
tasty
i
dont
think
you
will
find
this
in
liter
steins
anywhere
but
i
would
turn
this
down
if

again

not
the
most
extreme
style
out
there
and
it
is
meant
to
be
drank
in
large
quantities
but
this
one
was
just
a
bit
too
average
in
all
aspects
d
easy
drinking
beer
with
all
the
malts
and
sweets
going
on
i
may
not
be
able
to
drink
a
ton
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
still
i
feel
like
some
spice
could
be
added
d
this
is
a
good
session
beer
if
you
dont
mind
getting
a
bit
silly
i
say
session
away
responsibly
or
enjoy
one
with
buffalo
chicken
dip
like
i
am
drinkability
is
very
high
this
beer
typifies
a
lot
of
autumn
tastes
it
has
a
great
toffee
taste
and
strong
malt
characteristics
the
sharp
bite
but
smooth
finish
typifies
the
weather
and
attitude
of
the
autumn
season
that
the
beer
is
created
for
definitely
recommended
to
drink
on
a
crisp
fall
day
d
a
good
tasting
easy
drinking
fall
seasonal
brew
d
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
here
and
it
is
decent
and
i
cuold
see
myself
with
a
sixer
of
this
this
would
be
great
on
a
crips
and
cool
autumn
day

overall
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
but
im
going
to
stick
to
traditional
marzens
worth
a
shot
though
d
pretty
drinkable
and
certainly
worth
getting
d
a
pleasure
to
drink
well
done
maybe
not
a
marzen
when
taken
in
its
entirety
but
drinkable
yes
not
great
but
awfully
tasty
overall
my
thoughts
would
be
ehh
forgettable
boring
and
painfully
average
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
just
not
something
i
would
particularly
want
to
go
back
to
drink
ability
a
good
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
i
will
buy
again
next
season
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
pghlee
at
the
brick
store
thanks
lee
poured
copper
colored
with
a
thin
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
swirl
on
top
the
smell
was
very
promising
with
wonderful
aromas
of
sweet
bready
malt
with
banana
clove
and
a
banana
bread
finish
unfortunately
the
taste
was
far
more
washed
out
exhibiting
none
of
the
richness
found
in
the
aroma
tastes
very
bready
and
a
bit
heavy
but
wihout
that
breadintheoven
quality
found
in
the
aroma
grainy
a
little
thin
and
with
a
metallic
zinclike
taste
up
front
followed
by
a
light
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
banana
bread
on
the
finish
fairly
highly
carbonated
but
somewhat
thin
lacks
a
bit
of
richness
this
is
okay
overall
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
fest
beers
out
there
id
choose
over
this
one
also
what
gives
it
is
august
a
bit
early
yet
for
the
fest
season
at
least
wait
for
sep
1
to
release
these
pours
a
nice
light
copper
color
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
an
amberred
but
still
nice
allows
a
nice
splash
of
light
to
come
through
has
a
bit
of
head
that
immediately
goes
away
with
very
little
lacing
nice
scent
malty
but
with
a
very
sour
aroma
much
like
an
irish
red
very
sweet
and
sour
taste
although
with
very
little
spices
as
i
would
expect
from
an
autumn
brew
although
there
are
very
small
bits
of
cinnamon
goes
down
fine
but
there
are
better
fall
beers
out
there
recommended
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
one
inch
head
that
gave
way
to
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
not
that
great
a
grassy
smell
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
some
hops
the
taste
was
a
little
better
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
a
slight
spiciness
seemed
a
little
watered
down
for
a
weyerbacher
brew
but
it
could
just
be
the
style
good
drinkability
but
nothing
special
caramel
malt
also
largely
contributes
to
the
taste
has
hints
of
other
spice
that
lingers
not
quite
typical
of
an
amberred
ale
more
of
an
oktoberfest
style
d
a
hearty
and
an
easy
beautiful
drink
for
the
fall
season
can
honestly
sit
and
enjoy
this
all
night
around
the
campfire
on
a
brisk
fall
night
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
this
one
seems
to
be
a
hybrid
of
an
oktoberfest
and
a
winter
warmer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
pours
a
very
foggy
orangeish
brown
no
head
in
my
duvel
tulip
nose
is
slightly
leafy
very
little
to
it
flavor
is
even
and
constant
with
a
slow
drop
off
profile
has
a
obvious
leafy
thing
going
on
beyond
that
its
a
very
mild
almost
citric
thing
more
like
the
flavor
of
an
orange
with
absolutely
no
sweetness
from
it
more
like
old
almost
dead
orange
outer
skins
okay
enough
typing
out
of
my
ass
feel
is
decent
low
bubble
hitting
my
tongue
liquid
is
decent
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
nothing
wild
or
crazy
just
a
smooth
and
even
brew
worth
a
shot
a
12ox
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
head
somewhat
muted
aroma
sweet
malt
and
some
fruit
tasting
revealed
the
fruit
to
be
pumpkin
with
a
light
malt
background
i
think
i
also
got
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
a
crisp
enjoyable
beer
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
autumn
brew
drinkable
but
not
necessarily
enjoyable
if
you
tend
to
prefer
a
more
robust
beer
then
again
this
is
an
amber
red
ale
had
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
surprisingly
reddish
colored
for
something
i
thought
would
be
more
seasonal
finding
out
it
was
a
red
ale
and
that
the
red
colors
were
quite
sharp
though
gave
me
approval
the
aroma
definitely
had
the
classic
smells
cinnamon
pumpkin
spice
etc
its
taste
was
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
spice
making
it
very
accessible
its
thick
lowcarb
feel
made
it
come
down
smooth
overall
a
very
accessible
autumnal
beer
of
the
many
octoberautumn
fests
ive
had
this
one
is
a
very
close
second
to
paulaner
ofest
very
beautiful
amber
color
nice
smoooth
and
caramely
taste
but
not
too
sweet
and
very
drinkable
i
truly
like
this
one
and
was
glad
my
buddy
brought
some
to
my
place
to
sample
over
the
weekend
we
enjoyed
em
with
brats
and
german
fair
nice
brew
weyerbacher
highly
recommended
if
you
like
this
style
of
brew
great
for
the
fall
season
for
color
and
flavor
cheers
and
saaalute
my
ba
friends
d
this
one
looks
and
tastes
like
an
ale
version
of
oktoberfest
its
a
good
idea
and
a
decent
beer
but
for
this
brews
color
i
expected
a
lot
more
caramel
malt
presence
drinkable
and
somewhat
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
from
weyerbacher
looks
like
clear
dark
apple
juice
with
a
couple
of
bubbles
has
a
dense
offwhite
head
nose
is
gentle
hops
and
slight
biscuity
malts
taste
has
a
hint
of
metallic
flavor
with
a
malty
backbone
a
mile
unnatural
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
on
the
end
not
too
much
good
going
on
here
however
mouthfeel
is
above
average
its
more
dense
than
expected
and
really
fills
out
your
mouth
drinkability
is
exactly
average
12oz
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
an
amber
red
translucent
body
with
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
roasty
husky
malt
dominate
with
little
hops
to
speak
of
with
hints
of
diacetyl
light
to
medium
in
body
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
tasty
enough
but
not
their
best
offering
nor
is
it
the
best
octoberfest
ale
out
there
overall
not
too
bad
could
stand
alone
outside
the
fall
seasonal
time
as
a
reasonable
light
amber
ale
mouthfeeldrinkability
phenomenal
great
beer
drinkable
not
much
drinkability
all
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
to
create
a
pleasing
refreshing
oktoberfest
beer
drinkability
so
ill
admit
this
isnt
my
fav
style
and
this
brews
just
okay
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
weyerbacher
has
a
nice
brew
you
should
give
a
shot
if
you
get
a
chance
but
definetly
not
one
worth
going
out
of
your
way
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
big
malt
flavors
the
ale
is
a
good
fit
for
the
season
light
bodied
and
a
real
easy
drinker
might
be
a
nice
one
for
drinking
a
sixer
out
by
the
fire
or
something
i
think
a
more
descriptive
label
would
have
given
me
a
hint
and
i
might
not
have
picked
it
up
i
guess
the
others
of
the
weyerbacher
breed
had
opened
the
door
wide
in
my
mind
and
this
one
just
didnt
compare
still
i
would
not
refuse
one
of
these
i
just
wont
buy
it
again
overall
i
could
drink
several
of
these
but
would
not
seek
it
out
in
the
future
pours
a
clear
light
copper
hue
with
a
one
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
lasting
throughout
i
really
enjoy
this
smell
very
unique
has
a
hint
of
dried
leaves
almost
and
yes
i
do
enjoy
that
smell
also
combines
some
mild
caramel
sweetness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
floral
hops
as
well
taste
starts
off
with
a
clean
citrusy
hops
that
is
quickly
diluted
by
the
malty
sweetness
aftertaste
leaves
an
almost
tea
like
flavor
that
is
quite
enjoyable
to
me
anyway
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
found
this
one
went
down
much
quicker
than
i
had
anticipated
nice
twist
on
the
autumn
seasonal
grainy
first
mouthfeel
impression
starts
to
smooth
out
the
more
you
drink
and
becomes
drier
also
not
bad
could
drink
a
few
not
a
beer
i
would
buybut
i
wont
turn
it
down
either
drinkability
great
for
a
fall
evening
slightly
warming
with
enough
flavor
to
get
you
by
and
not
kill
you
after
a
six
pack
worth
a
shot
nothing
wrong
with
getting
a
jump
start
on
the
fall
seasonals
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
tannish
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
cap
but
leaves
ample
lacing
smells
of
bread
with
a
small
malt
background
but
theres
little
here
to
sniff
at
tasting
reveals
more
of
the
same
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
slight
hop
snap
im
also
picking
up
some
hints
of
honey
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
thin
with
plenty
of
carbonation
i
could
easily
see
this
as
a
sessionable
beer
with
football
on
its
way
a
good
choice
for
a
day
like
today
where
there
are
hints
of
fall
coming
in
the
winter
but
not
a
standout
brew
overall
if
you
can
have
christmas
in
july
why
not
oktoberfest
this
is
not
a
true
marzen
they
dont
claim
it
to
be
one
though
it
reminds
me
of
one
but
its
a
nice
drinker
nonetheless
i
enjoy
oktoberfest
and
drinking
all
the
offerings
by
americas
best
micro
breweries
this
beer
has
me
looking
forward
to
the
start
of
fall
and
to
many
many
cases
of
different
oktoberfest
brews
prost
hmm
ive
never
said
this
before
but
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
in
larger
gulps
sipping
leaves
an
empty
almost
watery
taste
on
your
tongue
in
larger
considerations
it
has
a
nice
roasted
edge
and
smooth
body
making
it
ideal
for
the
litre
steins
of
ofest
i
dont
think
id
go
for
this
outside
of
the
beer
holiday
however
ok
im
probably
drinking
this
a
little
bit
late
february
but
oh
well
from
a
12
ozer
this
poured
with
the
appearance
of
fall
bright
and
orange
with
a
thin
cloud
cover
the
aroma
is
light
and
airy
with
almost
a
sense
of
a
gourd
sweet
to
be
sure
very
much
in
the
viennafest
family
with
light
caramel
all
around
the
edges
this
of
course
isnt
doing
anything
to
warm
my
blood
on
this
frigid
wet
february
evening
but
it
would
probably
be
a
nice
session
beer
for
a
cool
crisp
fall
night
when
the
leaves
are
just
starting
to
fall
down
2728

pours
a
reddish
amber
with
decent
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
leaving
next
to
no
retention
not
much
at
all
in
the
way
of
carbonation
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
taste
is
slightly
sweet
maybe
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
feint
hop
presence
pretty
well
balanced
but
a
bit
light
and
bland
overall
pretty
average
brew
drinkability
what
an
oktoberfest
would
be
if
an
oktoberfest
could
be
an
ale
come
to
think
of
it
thats
not
such
a
bad
idea
for
a
beer
decent
session
beer
overall
this
one
should
be
listed
as
a
marzenoktoberfest
rather
than
an
american
amberred
given
that
its
a
fairly
good
oktoberfest
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
but
worth
a
shot
drinkability
is
good
and
enjoyable
enough
beer
a
wee
bit
different
not
bad
but
dont
see
making
this
purchase
again
as
better
ambers
are
available
i
prefer
a
bigger
hop
profile
but
that
is
personal
preference
and
not
a
style
flaw
for
this
beer
it
was
pretty
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
this
is
more
of
an
oktoberfestmarzen
style
than
a
redamber
and
i
might
add
one
of
the
best
ones
i
have
had
a
copper
body
with
a
slim
head
that
sunk
down
to
a
thin
layer
around
the
glass
leaving
some
lacing
down
the
side
after
every
drink
nice
semisweet
malt
with
some
caramel
undertones
very
smooth
and
finishes
nicely
a
highly
drinkable
take
on
a
lager
that
compliments
the
coolness
of
autumn
12
ounce
bottle
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
a
clear
orangey
amber
with
a
finger
of
ecru
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
the
bouquet
is
buttery
almost
sugarysyrupy
with
toastycaramel
malts
mild
hops
and
some
fruityfloral
esters
the
flavor
is
the
same
light
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
slowly
creeps
up
on
top
of
a
light
body
that
has
medium
carbonation
and
leaves
a
short
finish
first
off
it
needs
a
lager
yeast
as
the
ale
yeast
makes
it
to
floral
and
fruity
but
after
that
they
need
to
beef
up
the
toasted
and
caramel
malts
as
is
its
too
light
and
comes
across
as
a
yuengling
fermented
with
ale
yeast
i
realize
they
are
experimenting
a
bit
but
i
think
they
should
have
gone
a
more
traditional
route
overall
this
is
an
atypical
fall
beer
that
still
taste
like
fall
very
solid
fall
seasonal
from
weyerbacher
this
beer
is
above
average
for
the
style
i
think
the
style
listed
is
not
accurate
this
beer
just
does
not
fit
the
amber
ale
style
there
is
a
spiced
smell
and
the
taste
is
like
an
oktoberfest
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
good
way
to
welcome
the
fall
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
there
is
an
eversoslight
warming
feeling
to
this
beer
too
dthis
one
is
definitely
a
session
beer
the
first
night
i
drank
it
was
before
i
went
out
to
a
concert
easy
to
drink
slightly
filling
overall
a
good
brew
might
be
a
little
pricey
at
its
normal
price
i
think
1
99
a
bottle
or
10
a
six
pack
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
great
deal
and
i
know
several
of
my
friends
will
like
it
too
so
i
guess
i
will
be
buying
a
case
to
make
sure
theres
enough
drinkability
pretty
good
no
mouthfeel
very
watery
and
hardly
any
body
i
only
bought
a
six
pack
but
i
should
have
purchased
a
single
not
a
very
good
beer
i
like
most
other
weyerbacher
offerings
this
one
completely
misses
taste
features
bittersweet
biscuity
malts
with
a
subdued
but
balancing
spicy
hops
profile
very
nice
and
well
balanced
very
tasty
and
quite
sessionable
considering
the
abv
an
excellent
effort
from
this
underappreciated
brewery
thanks
to
mntlover
for
sending
this
one
out
my
way
pours
a
clear
amber
with
minimal
head
that
dissipates
quickly
good
malty
smell
with
no
notice
of
hops
the
taste
is
quite
good
well
balanced
with
a
smooth
clean
finish
as
it
turns
out
seems
a
very
drinkable

could
easily
throw
down
a
few
more
of
these
picked
this
beer
up
because
i
thought
it
was
an
oktoberfest
from
the
bottle
and
name
rather
disappointed
to
find
that
it
isnt
pours
a
bright
clear

a
thin
white

vanishes
quickly
no

nose
is
a
slight
somewhat
sweet
malt
slight
bit
of
fruit
not
much
going
on
taste
is
a
biscuity
slightly
sweet
malt
upfront
a
hint
of
apple
caramel
and
hops
coming
through
in
the
middle
finishing
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
and
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
nothing
really
that
great
either
and
combined
with
the
thin
mouthfeel
its
really
not
a
beer
im
likely
to
buy
again
its
not
densely
so
but
it
is
certainly
malty
and
with
a
light
snap
of
spice
to
boot
the
combination
actually
makes
it
more
drinkable
as
it
moves
along
and
a
bit
more
as
a
whole
than
just
a
reflection
of
each
part
its
not
a
great
offering
or
even
a
real
good
one
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
one
an
average
beer
this
has
its
drawbacks
and
its
strengths
might
go
good
with
a
blue
cheese
coated
steak
i
wouldnt
go
lookiiing
for
this
and
would
pass
it
by
if
i
saw
it
all
in
the
hunt
for
something
better
pours
out
a
light
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
which
dissapeared
pretty
quick
i
get
some
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
and
some
pretty
sweet
malt
it
tastes
pretty
good
same
spicy
hops
but
the
malt
tastes
more
toasted
than
sweet
it
is
not
particularly
full
bodied
kind
of
falls
flat
in
terms
of
the
style
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
in
terms
of
the
brewer
weyerbacher
it
is
way
tame
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
some
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
someone
who
isnt
a
serious
beer
drinker
for
someone
looking
for
a
fuller
beer
keep
looking

the

behind
just
a
touch
of
lacing
aromas
of
malt
dried

cream
and
freshly

and
sweet

a
nice

a
gentle
roasted
flavor
with

flavors
light
texture
but
still
smooth
and
slightly
velvetlike
in
my
opinion
this
tasted
like
a
cross
between
an
english
ipa
and
an
english
brown
ale
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
its
great
texture

dont

but
this
is
a
solid
fall
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
to
be
honest
this
reminded
me
of
yuengling
with
a
bit
more
malt
perhaps
a
big
brother
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
short
cap

white
foam
good
retention
and
a

of
lacing
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
and
honey
slightly
floral
mostly
sweet
the
malt
character
is
still
a
little
thin
light
floral
bitterness
as
well
dry
finish
not
bad
but
fairly
average
there
are
a
lot
of
octoberfests
and
other
seasonals
that
id
go
for
before
having
this
again
nothing
groundbreaking
from
weyerbacher
but
a
pleasant
offering
that
foreshadows
fallen
leaves
and
cooler
weather
the
appearance
is
really
excellent
here
with
a
nice
amber
body
and
a
big
tan
colored
head
that
retains
impressively
the
aroma
is
mostly
authentic
with
caramel
and
toasted
bread
upfront
along
with
a
spicy
and
floral
hops
presence
some
dark
fruits
and
a
touch

the
flavor
is
similar
to
the

along
with
some
toasted

spicy

floral
hops
some
mild
yeastiness
and
a
hint
of

the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
excellent
drinkability
a
solid
and
moderately
complex
octoberfest
seriously
good
stuff
here
a
crystal
amber
with
a
off
white
head
that
gives
up
some
lacing
a
dominating
german
malt
smell
that
is
slacked
with
some
gentle
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
everything
i
thought
it
would
be
from
the
smell
it
has
that
fall
ofest
taste
but
is
bodied
up
and
their
is
a
creamy
aspect
to
this
beer
as
well
the
hops
help
dry
out
the
finish
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
right
on
time
this
beer
should
be
put
into
year
round
production
all
in
all
a
nice
autumn
offering
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
on
the
patio
and
watch
the
leaves
turn
colors
i
liked
this
one
not
the
standard
ofest
as
it
has
a
bit
more
hops
than
the
style
and
is
a
bit
lighter
on
the
pallatte
nice
ambercopper
coloration
and
a
bit
of
bread
in
the
initial
nose
the
hop
finish
catches
you
at
the
end
good
stuff
from
weyerbacher
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
one
maybe
im
a
bit
harsh
but
when
i
think
autumn
i
think
dopplebockoktoberfest
styles
autumnfest
has
the
appearance
and
smell
but
the
taste
is
way
lighter
than
i
had
expected
it
was
lightly
carbonated
and
the
head
laced
the
chalice
till
the
end
however
i
wasnt
sold
the
flavors
blended
well
but
were
gone
in
a
flash
this
one
to
me
is
light
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
but
i
wasnt
looking
for
that
when
i
bought
this
one
a
good
beer
to
have
around
to
offer
the
average
someone
something
different
but
i
wouldnt
brag
too
much
about
autumnfest
to
someone
who
knows
beers
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
though
it
didnt
rock
my
beer
world
but
it
did
hit
the
spot
on
a
damp
night
overall
a
tasty
beer
this
does
just
fine
on
a
hot
day
as
well
as
a
warm
autumn
afternoon
or
a
cool
crisp
night
pours
a
pretty
but
prosaic
deep
amber
with
minimal
head
aromas
of
rich
dry
malts
and
slight
sour
yeast
on
the
palate
opens
up
with
sweetness
before
shifting
into
a
mellow
graininess
with
a
slight
bite
smooth
easy
going
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
smooth
pleasing
autumn
session
beer
this
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
with
a
medium
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
is
weak
with
some
sweet
malt
and
little
else
the
taste
has
a
high
carbonation
feel
to
it
with
a
malt
sweetness
thats
not
bad
the
flavors
are
also
nutty
and
very
chewy
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
making
this
a
good
beer
worth
trying
not
an
exceptional
beer
but
a
bit
above
average
worth
a
try
i
had
hoped
that
autumn
fest
would
bring
back
memories
of
good
beer
enjoyed
during
my
favorite
season
of
the
year
because
of
the
lack
of
style
specificity
i
had
a
hard
time
finding
a
focal
point
something
to
grab
onto
and
appreciate
for
its
own
sake
this
is
not
one
of
weyerbachers
better
efforts
easy
enough
to
drink
just
not
very
exciting
poured
a
cloudy
peach
color
with
scant
slightly
offwhite
head
that
quickly
feel
to
a
thin
ring
lacing
is
minimal
smell
is
of
sweet
toasted
malt
combined
with
a
dark
cherries
taste
is
dark
and
malty
caramel
tastes
are
to
be
found
a
bit
of
dryness
is
revealed
that
helps
to
temper
the
sweet
maltiness
dryness
becomes
stronger
in
the
finish
to
get
a
nice
ending
a
very
good
autumn
beer
this
is
probably
the
most
disappointing
beer
ive
had
from
weyerbacher
to
date
their
stuff
is
usually
dead
nuts
but
this
one
leaves
alot
to
be
desired
not
enough
malt
character
for
a
good
fall
seasonal
imo
pours
a
nice
amberred
color
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
bready
taste
is
slightly
sour
and
notes
of
floral
hops
its
okay
not
great
the
sour
taste
puts
me
off
a
bit
from
it
though
its
an
okay
beer
but
it
has
room
to
grow
and
improve
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
creamy
head
with
good
retention
ths
smell
is
mostly
grassy
malt
with
caramel
and
some
light
citrus
the
taste
is
full
of
big
caramel
malts
with
some
bread
and
light
esters
and
a
nice
crisp
light
citrus
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
tealike
texture
and
low
carbonation
quite
tasty
and
just
unique
enough
to
keep
it
separated
in
my
mind
from
the
many
other
festmärzens
ive
had
lately
a
good
fall
beer
although
initially
satisfying
this
is
a
very
plain
beer
with
little
flavour
and
strong
carbonation
amber
colour
some
lace
not
much
head
have
had
much
better
autumn
seasonals
there
could
be
a
drop
of
smoke
in
mid
sip
touch
of
hops
not
too
malty
pours
a
nice
amber
color
looks
like
autumn
in
a
glass
one
inch
head
went
into
a
nice
lace
very
refreshing
sweet
with
a
nice
finish
i
would
compare
it
to
a
good
honey
brown
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
this
beer
would
be
a
good
choice
any
time
of
the
year
overall
even
if
you
dont
get
the
best
experience
with
this
one
it
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
consume
in
mass
quantities
that
is
until
you
fall
over
drunk
pretty
good
but
should
be
better
from
this
house
pale
orange
color
decent
white

kind

ale
faint

finish
decent

on
the
tongue
and
nice
level
of
carbonation
not
one
of
weyerbachers
best
offering
but
worth
a
try
drinkability
wouldnt
again
i
got
several
octoberfests
to
try
and
while
this
is
a
better
beer
than
your
average
ale
it
just
didnt
make
any
kind
of
impression
poured
a
perfectly
clear
brown
in
color
with
a
centimeter
thick
head
the
head
receded
to
formy
a
spotty
film
mouthfeel
was
odd
for
a
fall
seasonal
i
was
expecting
something
more
juicy
which
this
beer
was
trying
to
do
but
it
had
a
sudden
dry
smack
on
the
lips
that
left
me
wondering
what
the
hell
was
going
on
nose
is
malts
that
have
soured
flavor
is
all
malts
with
just
a
slight
hop
bitterness
towards
the
very
end
malts
come
across
as
bits
of
biscutis
toast
little
bits
of
pumpkine
pie
spices
and
overripe
fruit
it
was
the
overripe
fruit
that
knocked
this
beer
off
for
me
as
representative
of
the
style
the
malts
in
the
beer
were
too
sour
and
not
rich
enough
pours
a
light
somewhat
cloudy
orangeamber
with
decent
offwhite

that
quickly
dissipates
into

of
the

but
not
much

definite
fruit
tartish

reminiscent
of


cinnamon
smooth
with
a
nice
gradual
finish
thin

doesnt
hold
medium

and
nicely
drinkable
given
its
relatively
high

content
fairly
light
for
a
octoberfest
correctly
identified
closer
to
a
red
ale
here
either
way
a
solid
autumn
seasonal

good
fall
session
beer
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
special
perhaps
my
least
favorite
brew
from
weyerbacher
the
taste
was
a
great
combination
of
noble
malts
hardly
any
hop
bitterness
in
this
brew
just
enough
to
balance
the
malt
bomb
character
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
with
good
body
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
would
not
recommend
this
as
a
session
beer
each
bottle
should
be
savored
cheers

perfect
for
the

quality
to
it
although
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
marzenoctoberfest
style
i
have
to
say
that
im
not
impressed
with
the
style
as
a
whole
so
thats
why
the

to
add
yes
i
know
its

the
taste
was
of

this
cloudy
copper
beer
had
a
small
but
lasting
head
as
well
as
some
streaky
lace
the
aroma
was
rather
too
subtle
some
hop
bouquet
nutty
with
a
tad
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
this
beers
real
strong
point
good
flavoring
hops
are
blended
well
with
the
malt
to
make
this
a
smooth
tasty
beer
it
has
some
nuttiness
to
it
as
well
as
a
decent
bite
the
slightly
dry
finish
is
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
not
a
great
beer
but
pretty
drinkable
the
taste
was
medium
bodied
malty
and
surprisingly
rather
meaty
tasted
almost
like
mellow
turkey
gravy
at
times
i
know
it
sounds
weird
but
it
does
theres
a
very
quick
bitterness
but
for
most
part
its
almost
nonexistent
for
the
most
part
though
a
very
clean

id
have
another

not
until
after
i
checked

is
similar
to
the

mellowed
by
some

a

12
oz
bottle
this
years
label
is
different
than
the
one
pictured
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
frothy
beige
head
some
stickage
and
lacing
bready
malty
nose
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
mostly
apple
initial
impression
is
that
it
is
rather
malty
sweet
with
some
light
fruitiness
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
that
show
up
moreso
in
the
finish
alcohol
seems
noticable
but
not
overbearing
lightly
toasted
character
pretty
nice
and
interesting
twist
on
the
maerzenoktoberfest
style
a
strange
beer
at
first
i
didnt
like
it
but
it
quickly
grew
on
me
and
i
think
it
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
pours
out
an
amberreddish
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
visible
smell
consisted
of
malts
some
nutty
and
fruity
aromas
in
there
as
well
some
distant
caramel
aromas
also
show
up
taste
is
also
malty
with
some
various
spices
showing
up
along
with
some
nuttiness
but
then
it
turns
quite
sweet
its
not
really
overwhelming
but
it
also
doesnt
seem
out
of
place
it
is
balanced
ot
handle
the
sweetness
so
it
does
go
hand
in
hand
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
with
some
good
carbonation
mixing
in
not
a
bad
seasonal
at
all
perhaps
for
some
people
the
sweetness
could
bring
down
the
drinkability
which
i
gave
an
average
rating
having
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
the
sweetness
may
get
in
a
way
and
become
annoying
drinkability
notes
delicious
with
that
psuedoocktoberfest
flavor
this
is
just
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
want
to
lead
into
the
cooler
months
with
this
beer
pours
out
a
clear
copper
body
with
a
single
finger
of
tan
foam
for
the
head
the
head
dissipates
to
a
thin
lacing
layer
with
some
decent
lace
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
light
but
gives
some
hint
of
its
hopping
the
taste
tends
to
the
sweet
side
with
some
hints
of
pumpkin
and
very
light
spicing
the
body
is
medium
and
lacks
real
crispness
good
drinkability
overall
about
what
i
expected
from
something
called
autumnfest
very
tasty
beverage
pours
a
semi
hazy
orangee
color
minimal
head
nice
sweet
nose
some
definite
pumpkin
pie
also
some
toasty
notes
very
toasty
tasting
sweet
some
subtle
pumpkin
pie
flavors
this
is
quite
enjoyable
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
session
beer
but
a
nice
treat
nonetheless
id
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
this
is
a
different
tasting
marzenofest
than
i
can
ever
recall
having
its
heartier
and
more
full
in
general
it
pours
a
decent
looking
amber
colour
with
an
average
sized
head
to
top
it
off
looks
farily
crisp
as
well
the
nose
is
of
malt
earth
and
sweetness
i
may
have
picked
up
a
touch
of
pumpkin
in
here
as
well
the
taste
as
metioned
is
unique
malt
dominates
but
thrown
into
the
mix
are
earth
berry
and
other
fruitwhich
provides
for
some
sweetness
and
some
sorur
flavour
rubber
band
some
honey
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
this
one
is
inviting
in
a
strange
sort
of
way
its
not
your
run
of
the
mill
brew
its
not
out
of
this
world
but
its
a
far
cry
from
being
even
average
try
it
for
a
taste
of
something
different
at
the
very
least
it
is
respectable
that
weyerbacher
correctly
labeled
this
one
an
autumnfest
ale
rather
than
an
oktoberfest
that
may
have
gotten
the
germans
really
pissed
off
being
an
ale
rather
than
a
lager
this
has
great
flavor
of
the
traditional
malts
it
pours
a
bronzy
red
with
an
eggshell
head
smell
is
malty
and
a
little
roasty
with
the
sweet
grains
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
an
earthy
hop
balance
and
has
some
low
estery
fruitiness
from
the
ale
fermentation
probably
the
most
flavorful
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
season
i
hope
my
homebrewed
ofest
ale
turns
out
this
tasty
drinkability
and
overall
i
havent
had
many
of
the
classic
ofest
beers
so
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
classic
example
however
its
truly
enjoyable
definitely
towards
the
malty
side
but
a
nicely
balanced
beer
a
dark
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
just
alittle
lace
has
a
rich
biscutmalty
aroma
the
biscut
characteristic
carries
over
into
the
flavor
at
the
start
of
the
taste
followed
by
a
malty
sweetness
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
finish

a

compared
to
the

it
seems
like
a
totally
different
beer
it
needs
to
be
alittle
more
intense
for
me
still
very
clean
and
very
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
is
light
and
creamy
it
is
a
bit
yeasty
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
very
smooth
light
and
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
sweet
and
fruity
it
has
a
slight

taste
that
balances
the
palate
and
increases
its
complexity
the
mouthfeel

left

the
smell

just
a
hint
of
hops
too
the
taste
is
very
malty
up

with
lots

it
is
balanced
out
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
on
the

just
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
strong
and
the
drinkability
is
really
good

good

decent
a
dark

colour
reminscent
of

leaves
a
small
white
head
tops
this
brew
and
than
quickly
dissapears
the
aromas
are
of
honeyed
malts
and
light
floral
hops
the
taste
is
quite
malty
with
some
caramel
malts
coming
in
to
play
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
decent
brew
for
weyerbacher
but
not
that
good
compared
to
other
fall
brews
and
ofests
the
taste
comes
on
strong
with
a
bracing
and
welcoming
wave
of
malty
nuttiness
i
love
the
way
that
nuttiness
bounces
around
in
my
mouth
the
flavor
reveals
very
little
hops
which
i
dont
mind
the
tingling
and
the
flavor
coalesce
onto
the
center
of
my
tongue
i
want
to
say
it
reluctantly
fades
but
im
the
one
whos
reluctant
im
left
very
eager
for
another
swig
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
earthy
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcohol

in
the
aroma
toasted
and
nutty

overall
a
nice

sweetness
with
a

kick
looks
great

great
tastes
great
but
somehow
has
a
bit
too
much
burnt

like
eating
a
mouthful
of
semi
sweet
morsels
when
you
were
expecting
dark
chocolate
great
beer
why
not
a
vanilla
or
chocolate
barrelaged
red
ale
this
concept
fires
the
imagination
the
space
is
there
this
beers
a
good
red
a
great
red
even
but
it
doesnt
really
try
to
occupy
that
space
o
beer
was
too
old
not
the
brewers
fault
ill
revisit
this
beer
when
the
next
batch
rolls
out
m
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
as
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
red
ales
but
still
very
drinkable
kind
of
a
weird
hybrid
of
ale
porter
and
stout
as
mentioned
above
i
picked
up
a
22oz
bomber
from
my
local
shop
for
3
50
on
clearance
evidently
theyve
had
it
left
over
since
february
not
bad
at
all
for
that
price
overall
it
was
a
good
seasonal
beer
my
gf
got
it
for
me
and
i
gladly
drank
the
whole
bomber
easily
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
solid
beer
o
one
of
the
best
and
new
favorite
red
ales
ive
had
my
friends
will
tell
you
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
and
thats
no
doubt
the
case
as
i
always
have
lots
of
different
redsambers
gracing
my
fridge
year
round
but
let
me
tell
you
alesmiths
my
bloody
valentine
will
compete
with
the
best
this
style
has
to
offer
and
may
just
top
them
all
on
certain
days
what
a
treat
a
valentines

treat
that
will
have
me
making

i
do

may
have
made
it
even

on

usually
either
overall
a
very
good
hoppy
red
with
an
unfortunate
but
appropriate
name
overall
not
bad
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
mixed
with
heavy
malt
made
it
a
slow
drinker
for
me
this
is
a
great
amber
especially
at
822oz
this
is
the
definition
of
a
price
point
beer
its
not
15
not
10
its
one
hearty
amber
ale
highly
recommended
just
a
bit
funky
and
sweet
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
beers
of
choice
i
am
not
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
balances
the
sweet
and
bitter
notes
so
well
i
didnt
mind
a
stronger
than
normal
hop
presence
tastes
pretty
much
how
i
would
expect
a

beer
to
taste

a

it

whether

alesmith
has

the

its

hoppy
really
sticky
really
thick
resinous
ipa
deep
brick
red
amber
type
color
here
hazy
and
just
thick
as
honey
the
nose
is
citrusy
hop
high
alpha
robust
and
aggressive
in
all
aspects
the
malt
bill
is
huge
the
gravity
is
high
and
i
am
shocked
this
comes
in
under
7
abv
its
most
impressive
feature
a
little
pine
from
the
hops
but
its
sort
of
tough
to
tell
whether
the
sweet
malt
adds
that
sappy
character
or
the
hops
does
im
honestly
not
in
love
with
it
it
comes
across
a
bit
confused
to
say
the
least
bitter
and
sweet
but
not
in
a
good
way
really
it
gets
hard
to
drink
sticky
and
filling
especially
with
temperature
and
just
doesnt
wow
me
the
way
it
has
for
others
full
body
may
be
to
its
detriment
here
just
too
much
so
deal
with
but
the
carbonation
tries
as
hard
as
it
can
to
make
this
move
but
its
stuck
alesmith
can
really
do
no
wrong
for
me
but
i
like
this
less
than
most
of
their
other
stuff
i
expected
more
from
a
special
release
notes
its
a
little
dry
if
i
were
to
spend
valentines
day
alone
i
would
want
it
to
be
sweet
and
malty
its
nice
for
a
red
ale
however
very
solid
red
ale
right
here
they
seem
to
focus
on
the
malts
more
than
the
hops
on
this
one
which
is
cool
this
beer
will
be
compared
with
evil
dead
red
which
i
personally
enjoy
more
evil
dead
focuses
on
the
hops
my
bloody
valentine
focuses
more
on
the
malts
two
different
takes
on
the
styles
o
a
very
nice
beer
from
ale
smith
it
drinks
easy
and
had
a
nice
hop
presence
that
borders
the
pale
ale
category
dont
get
ale
smith
in
nc
but
if
we
did
i
would
drink
this
on
the
regular
pours
a
rich
deep
ruby
with
a
lingering
airy
head
that
left
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
strong
hops
in
the
nose
herbal
pungent
and
earthy
also
picking
up
nectarines
and
marzipan
taste
is
immediately
sweet
caramel
and
woodyfruity
hops
followed
by
a
bitterness
like
orange
pith
medium
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
soft
carbonic
bite
definitely
a
malt
oriented
beer
but
there
is
enough
hop
character
to
balance
it
and
bring
it
back
to
center
think
of
a
sweeter
milder
less
bitter
friend
of
arrogant
bastard
immensely
drinkable
o
this
is
nothing
like
evil
dead
not
in
any
way
evil
dead
is
bold
this
is
its
preteen
cousin
i
did
not
care
for
it
i
can
get
the
same
taste
from
generic
brands

a

as
a

really
good

not

it

very
good

bottle
from
campones
well
worth
the
12
and
email
to
keep
aside
for
me
hoppier
than
its
scent
above
average
mouthfeel
o
an
above
average
red
ale
that
delivers
on
all
fronts
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
such
a
strange
and
unique
combination
of
characteristics
but
decent
enough
to
pay
a
visit
to
if
given
the
opportunity
i
am
appreciative
of
the
chance
to
try
this
but
i
probably
would
not
have
it
again
if
i
had
other
options
available
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
interesting
blend
through
the
aroma
and
the
gorgeous
mouthfeel
the
initial
nose
gives
big
fruitiness
to
match
the
equally
as
big
shoes
of
the
grain
bill
and
the
deep
spicy
hoppiness
between
the
chocolate
and
the
strawberries
it
actually
did
feel
oddly
appropriate
for
the
holiday
the
flavoring
came
nicely
but
much
of
the
hoppiness
was
lost
between
the
massive
overhaul
of
caramel
chocolate
roast
and
toast
through
the
grain
this
also
made
room
for
the
sweetness
to
peak
just
a
bit
too
much
by
the
end
of
the
sip
more
than
making
up
for
it
was
the
feel
which
gave
silky
creamy
softness
to
each
hit
from
the
glass
this
is
a
tasty
well
executed
beer
and
it
seems
to
not
only
fit
the
style
but
fit
well
within
the
ranks
and
idiosyncrasies
of
the
brewery
i
find
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
stronger
amber
ales
despite
the
fact
that
the
abv
is
only
6
66
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of

intensity
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
that
is
lightly
foamy
and
persistently
smooth
across
the
palate
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
pretty
darn
good
amberred
i
would
even
probably
consider
it
a
pale
ale
of
ambers
behind
green
flash
red
ipa
this
is
my
fav
in
that
style
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
actually
gets
really
good
around
room
temp
for
some
reason
a
good
amber
or
red
is
the
only
style
besides
a
barley
wine
i
can
handle
at
room
temp
maybe
a
bba
stout
pick
it
up
delicious
alesmith
brewing
company
is
one
of
those
breweries
that
seems
to
never
let
me
down
im
not
sure
theyve
ever
brewed
even
an
average
beer
my
blood
valentine
is
another
fine
release
its
a
very
well
balanced
red
ale
thats
incredibly
drinkable
very
glad
to
finally
find
it
in
ohio
easy
recommendation
this
one
is
right
on
par
with
the
rest
of
alesmiths
ipas
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
is
also
pretty
awesome
this
is
a
really
nice
red
ale
and
probably
my
current
favorite
this
has
a
ton
of
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
and
the
abv
isnt
too
high
either
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
very
special
for
the
style
there
are
way
better
hoppy
red
ales
out
there
tocobaga
to
name
just
one
shazzam
this
is
great
beer
poured
perhaps
slightly
too
cold
immediate
hop
aroma
upon
opening
poured
with
a
giant
foamy
frothy
thick
light
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
red
with
some
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
very
heady
balanced
fresh
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
hop
that
was
mostly
pine
with
a
little
grapefruit
flavors
like
nose
slightly
roasty
which
i
love
dominated
by
the
hop
and
just
balanced
enough
by
the
malt
and
carbonic
tang
bodycarbonation
are
faultless
finish
is
like
flavor
long
and
just
a
tad
medicinal
very
drinkable
overall
this
beers
is
okay
nothing
mind
blowing
but
its
definately
a
beer
of
alesmith
well
know
quality
it
reminds
me
of
mbc
zoe
but
just
doesnt
taste
quite
as
good
o
good
stuff
and
an
easy
drinker
o
this
beer
has
a
great
balance
between
hops
and
malts
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
it
seems
more
like
a
hybrid
between
an
amber
ale
and
an
ipa
overall
a
good
beer
for
me
the
only
downside
was
that
earthy
quality
not
necessarily
a
bad
quality
just
didnt
seem
to
mesh
with
the
other
flavors
o
different
in
a
straightforward
way
this
brew
brings
earthy
hoppiness
built
on
a
strong
sweet
malt
foundation
the
sweetness
is
simple
and
almost
overcomes
this
brew
leaving
little
breathing
room
for
the
rest
of
the
palate
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
which
needed
more
malt
complexity
o
tasty
beer
kind
of
all
over
the
place
though
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
a
decent
balance
of
malt
and
hop
presence
with
an
emphasis
on
the
west
coast
dryhopping
nice
beer
although
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
expression
in
the
nose
overall
well
done
alesmith
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
that
doesnt
sacrifice
complexity
overall
what
this
beer
really
has
going
for
it
is
hop
aroma
otherwise
its
pretty
a
pretty
average
brew
with
a
gimicky
name
anyway
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
red
color
the
head
was
a
light
shade
of
tan
with
a
very
good
retention
and
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
its
also
hoppy
and
there
is
even
some
chocolate
coming
through
on
this
one
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
its
got
some
transitions
from
sweet
to
bitter
then
back
to
sweet
the
malt
followed
by
the
hops
and
finally
the
chocolate
comes
in
to
settle
things
down
a
bit
the
flavors
to
me
sometimes
get
a
little
on
the
awkward
side
so
at
times
i
really
liked
it
and
other
times
i
didnt
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
well
carbonated
and
had
a
medium
body
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
good
sometimes
though
i
think
the
flavors
in
it
clash
a
bit
and
that
hindered
my
thoughts
on
the
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
feel
there
are
better
alternatives
out
there
its
still
worth
trying
to
see
for
yourself
though
o
i
actually
did
like
this
beer
despite
my
criticisms
cue
joke
about
the
exgirlfriend
still
i
probably
wouldnt
have
again
unless
i
was
desperate
juicy
and
smooth
hardly
any
bitterness
but
still
heavy
on
the
hop
aromas
brilliantly
balanced
an
beautifully
executed
amber
ale
o
im
no
red
ale
expert
i
tend
to
dabble
but
i
also
tend
to
like
what
i
drink
and
this
was
no
exception
nor
was
it
exceptional
a
good
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
from
a
reliable
brewery
recommended
complex
and
flavorful
well
worth
a
try
nice
to
go
with
a
decadent
dessert
this
is
a
pretty
darn
nice
beer
not
a
top
scorer
in
terms
of
amber
ales
but
fits
the
valentines
theme
nicely
could
even
pair
nicely
with
a
chocolate
cake
or
chocolate
ice
cream
verdict
a
fairly
simple
amber
ale
the
malt
profile
is
rich
and
sweeter
but
the
hops
help
counterbalance
it
well
a
worthy
brew
o
at
first
this
didnt
overly
impress
me
but
it
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
i
really
appreciated
the
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
the
hops
and
i
also
thought
it
was
a
fairly
unique
brew
that
had
a
nice
theme
going
on
not
the
best
amber
ive
had
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
id
definitely
drink
this
again
and
i
recommend
checking
it
out
poured

great
medium

with

the
flavor
seems
very
low
key
at
first
but
is
quite
complex
despite
its
subtlety
i
could
not
stop
taking
sips
from
this
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
more
blood
red
but
should
have
known
alesmith
would
go
for
great
taste
and
feel
rather
than
gimmick
excellent
a
classic
horror
film
a
great
band
and
a
very
nice
red
ale
i
usually
despise
balance
but
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
mixing
up
interesting
tastes
balance
depth
very
good
beer
had
to
buy
this
for
valentines
day
you
win
alesmith
marketing
team
maybe
is
for
the
band
i
digress

i
dont
usually
go
for

but
this
is
hoppy
enough
to
keep
my
attention
not
just
a
novelty
a
solid
brew
overall
pretty
good
tastes
like
no
other
amber
rye
ive
ever
had
lots
of
citric
fruits
herbal
hops
and
caramel
malts
good
beer
nice
take
on
the
style
balanced
well
and
enjoyable
to
drink
im
enjoying
this
more
than
nugget
nectar
cause
the
hop
and
sweetness
are
not
out
of
the
ballpark
like
they
are
in
that
beer
very
enjoyable
o
i
had
never
heard
of
this
beer
i
stumbled
across
it
three
days
ago
and
figured
what
the
heck
its
valentines
day
and
im
cheesy
with
pairing
beers
and
days
of
insignificance
being
a
product
of
alesmith
made
it
a
safe
gamble
it
is
an
enjoyable
hoppy
amberred
ale
decent
mix
of
hops
and
malt
here
malt
getting
the
caramel
and
toffee
thing
to
your
senses
right
up
front
the
hops
are
probably
a
little
on
the
higher
side
but
this
is
something
that
is
approachably
balanced
but
sturdy
and
slightly
aggressive
at
the
same
time
a
twist
of
vanilla
chocolate
and
citrus
in
the
mouthfeel
very
subdued
compared
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
this
beer
puts
a
lot
of
different
aspects
together
to
make
a
far
better
than
average
amber
ale
you
get
plenty
of
cascade
hops
i
suspect
lots
of
caramelization
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
good
stuff
glad
i
picked
this
one
to
try
while
i
was
there
while
the
old
lady
as
usual
was
pounding
down
speedway
a
nicely
balanced
yet
very
flavorful
on
both
fronts
less
sweet
than
the
smell
indicates
the
hop
stays
back
until
the
beginning
of
swallow
it
does
take
over
and
leave
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
milky
body
with
an
under
average
carbonation
level
b
o
i
was
excited
to
see
a
beer
from
alesmith
that
i
had
not
seen
previously
i
was
not
disappointed
delicious
beer
this
is
a
treat
and
very
accurate
for
the
style
as
well
as
the
specific
idea
they
were
going
for
not
really
sure
this
was
a
good
description
of
a
beverage
suited
for
a
romantic
evening
but
its
doubtful
you
bought
an
alesmith
brew
to
please
your
better
half
marketing
aside
this
is
a
damn
good
hoppyred
i
look
forward
to
it
each
year
although
it
kinda
gets
lost
in
the
pliny

great

to
this
take
on

plenty

flavor
and
bitterness
as
well
overall
really
loving
this
beer
it
is
amazingly
clean

complex
i
taste
the

they
never
approach

could

several
of

wish
there
was
a
bit
more
to
it
the
palate
opens
with
an
herbal
and
chalky
bitterness
that
also
has
the
flavor
of
a
rather
bicarbonateheavy
water
profile
with
pine
and
moderately
juicy
citrus
hop
flavors
complementing
the
herbal
and
minty
bitterness
the
opening
flavors
are
quite
enjoyable
the
mid
palate
brings
a
bit
of
toast
and
toffee
sweetness
however
is
minimal
here
drying
toasty
and
hoppy
on
the
finish
theres
a
blend
of
pine
and
citrus
pith
present
medium
light
in
body
the
carbonation
here
is
rather
excellent
creamy
but
firming
lending
a
soft
and
smooth
palate
to
carry
the
flavors
the
water
profile
is
a
little
distracting
at
least
initially
but
the
carbonation
makes
up
for
it
very
good
highly
recommended
overall
tasty
and
not
too
expensive
overall
one
of
the
better
american
red
ales
out
there
nice
to
finally
see
this
in
bottles
o
tasty
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
hoppy
ambertype
ales
but
this
works
very
easy
drinking
this
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
fruit
and
a
bit
less
bite
without
sacrificing
freshness
of
hop
aromas
compared
to
the
last
release
of
evil
dead
red

dark

and
a
little

in
appearance
not
so
carbonated
in
the
mouth
one
of
the
best
hoppy
beers
ive
had
lately
on
the
cask
at
local
habit
in
san
diego
feb
15
its
a
dark
red
hued
brew
with
nice
foam
theres
a
crisp
hoppy
aroma
to
it
rounded
out
with
some
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
more
citrus
reminding
me
of
pink
grapefruit
nice
flavor
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
malty
with
some
piney
chew
to
give
it
character
and
complexity
the
style
isnt
my
favorite
but
its
done
so
well
it
just
obliterates
any
complaints
o
best
red
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
keeper
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
drink
ability
was
great
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
but
if
everyone
made
them
like
this
offering
i
would
be
pours
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
chunky
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
citrus
zest
and
grapefruit
mainly
taste
is
of
citrus
zest
grapefruit
and
some
other
peppery
and
herbal
hop
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
some
nice
hop
flavors
gong
on
best
amber
ale
if
you
can
truly
call
it
that
ive
ever
had
red
color
is
pretty
hard
to
get
in
to
a
beer
but
alesmith
did
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
one
there
is
a
light
tan
head
which
sits
atop
a
nice
brown
and
ruby
body
the
aroma
is
predominantly
of
fruity
centennial
hops
with
a
bit
of
peach
from
some
amarillo
the
malt
underlying
the
hops
is
apparent
even
with
this
much
hop
character
this
is
still
going
to
be
a
malty
beer
the
amarillo
is
lost
in
the
flavor
with
the
centennials
taking
center
stage
there
is
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
a
restrained
bitterness
that
allows
it
to
shine
through
pretty
solid
beer
t
opens
with
some
earthy
floral
hop
notes
and
moves
quickly
to
a
strong
biscuity
malt
note
toast
sticky
citrus
hops
and
a
clean
hoppy
finish
leaves
a
slight
unsweetened
chocolate
bitterness
as
well
drink
i
like
the
candy
creamy
finish
the
abv
was
there
but
over
done
and
had
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
extremely
drinkable
going
in
with
little
to
no
expectations
this
beer
really
impressed
me
ill
be
back
for
more
d
really
easy
drinking
and
was
tastier
from
the
last
time
i
had
it
good
hoppiness
too
also
was
good
paired
with
a
grilled
chicken
sandwich
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
most
striking
thing
about
it
is
the
color
as
its
being
poured
once
in
the
glass
its
not
as
interesting
a
very
good
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
d
very
easy
drinking
had
this
at
the
bar
and
everyone
in
my
party
liked
it
was
glad
to
have
caught
this
on
tap
at
churchills
and
not
had
to
hunt
for
it
after
valentines
day
at
5
for
the
pint
very
affordable
and
it
was
a
nice
way
to
acquaint
myself
with
churchills
which
id
recommend
the
fact
that
alesmith
makes
any
other
reds
is
a
crime
this
beer
was
amazing
this
year
i
was
able
to
have
it
on
tap
at
beachwood
bbq
fathers
office
and
najas
out
of
the
tap
pours
a
thick
creamy
love
story
you
can
hardly
see
through
it
for
its
murky
body
and
it
coats
your
palate
like
a
delicious
blanket
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
a
lot
of
times
red
ales
seem
a
bit
thin
and
harshly
carbonated
this
is
a
beer
for
people
who
love
big
beers
but
it
keeps
it
relaxed
with
its
nonthreatening
abv
sometimes
d
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
from
alesmith
its
unfortunate
that
this
beer
isnt
one
of
their
staples

i
found
this
beer
to
be
somewhat
standard
for
an
alesmith
beer
least
favorite
alesmith
to
date
mind
you
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
reds
so
im
trying
not
to
be
biased
bottle
date
was
a
while
back
and
the
hops
im
sure
have
faded
quite
a
bit
nice
body
but
just
too
sweet
hoppy
red
ale
ipa
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
bitter
finish
reminds
me
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
on
tap
at
beachwood
bbq
and
poured
into
half
size
ale
glass
appearance
is
copperorange
with
foamy
head
that
settles
but
leaves
the
glass
coated
with
lace
big
balanced
aromas
split
between
herbal
and
citrus
hops
and
toffee
malts
plus
a
little
dankness
taste
is
early
butterscotch
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
mixed
with
orange
peel
bitterness
and
alcohol
esters
warm
on
the
swallow
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
creamy
and
thick
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
low
and
soft
beautiful
draft
pour
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
nice
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smelled
very
nice
with
a
good
combination
of
sweet
and
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
taste
was
very
similar
quite
delicious
but
with
the
alcohol
breaking
through
great
beer
for
sitting
down
in
front
of
the
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
deep
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
to
it
a
woody
kind
of
color
with
a
very
pleasing
looking
soapy
foam
tan
head
and
clingy
sheety
lace
aroma
is
just
the
right
amount
of
sweet
caramel
encrusted
graham
crackers
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
festive
aromas
for
sure
flavor
is
a
bit
more
serious
than
the
smell
by
that
i
mean
its
more
direct
sweet
and
spicy
but
also
assertive
the
high
abv
is
not
completely
hidden
and
reminds
you
that
you
are
in
fact
celebrating
the
holidays
theres
a
nice
fresh
pile
of
malt
under
the
hops
and
seasonings
but
this
beer
doesnt
take
on
a
heavy
character
at
all
its
apparently
strong
but
light
and
swirly
in
flavors
flavors
include
grapefruit
pulp
coniferous
vegetation
nutmeg
cinnamon
honey
graham
crackers
and
perhaps
a
dusting
of
molasses
very
pleasant
drinkins
mouthfeel
is
soft
around
the
edges
smooth
finely
carbonated
easy
and
delightful
to
consume
deep
hazy
rust
color
topped
with
a
densely
creamy
head
that
deposits
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
and
never
quite
fully
disappears
despite
being
obviously
hopped
up
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
about
the
aroma
is
a
lovely
graham
cracker
crust
brown
sugar
and
cake
that
contributes
a
certain
warm
holiday
festiveness
to
the
brew
pine
needles
woody
spice
and
grapefruit
flavor
is
big
and
hoppy
but
nicely
balanced
spicy
pine
resin
citrus
floral
hops
toasted
bread
black
tea
and
cake
rich
but
the
solid
wall
of
hop
bitterness
keeps
things
in
balance
and
thus
surprisingly
drinkable
for
9
5
not
all
that
boozy
either
though
a
warmth
grows
in
the
throat
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
seems
to
fit
the
season
well
this
is
one
of
the
better
hoppy
reds
ive
had
good
job
alesmith
big
resin
pine
taste
to
start
the
back
end
is
full
of

b
o
after
so
many
dark
and
spiced
seasonal
beers
this
is
a
much
appreciated
change
of
pace
just
what
i
would
expect
for
xmas
in
san
diego
love
it
great
beer
for
fallwinter
would
be
great
to
drink
on
a
cold
evening
while
watching
it
snow
too
bad
i
like
in
socal
if
you
like
malty
and
alcoholic
brews
it
is
a
good
choice
for
you
i
was
rooting
around
in
the
cellar
and
found
one
of
these
from
2010
alesmith
website
says
it
doesnt
improve
with
age
so
i
popped
it
open
right
away
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
3
fingers
fluffy
head
on
top
of
brown
slightly
transparent
body
aromas
of
spice
apricot
peach
and
heavy
malt
tasted
of
heavy
booze
like
it
was
bba
but
deceiving
since
its
only
8
very
malty
with
fruit
subtones
very
smooth
overall
i
dont
think
it
improved
with
age
but
4
years
didnt
make
it
any
worse
still
the
same
old
awesomeness
from
alesmith
cheers
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
really
as
it
is
way
too
hoppy
for
me
the
hoppy
bitterness
totally
overpowers
all
of
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
sorry
alesmith
this
beer
is
not
for
me
hop
heads
should
love
it
though
othis
was
one
of
my
iso
after
i
had
their
ipa
and
they
didnt
disappoint
me
i
must
try
more
of
their
brews
especially
speedway
overall
this
is
genuinely
cracking
stuff
and
i
guess
id
expect
no
less
from
alesmith
its
fragrant
and
bright
but
with
depth
and
gravitas
a
really
wellcrafted
beer
overall
its
the
balanced
play
with
strong
malty
backbone
and
fruity
hops
that
does
it
brings
out
the
fresh
succulent
flavor
and
feeling
not
too
complex
but
rich
enough
to
enjoy
throughout
well
done
overall
an
amazing
well
balanced
dipa
with
sweet
caramel
malt
fruit
and
a
ton
of
piney
hops
rich
creamy
head
close
to
three
fingers
tan
in
color
with
an
orange
tint
for
as
fluffy
as
it
is
has
wonderful
retention
and
the
lacing
is
strong
too
long
thick
streaks
form
every
time
the
glass
is
turned
dark
if
clear
amber
red
color
kind
of
has
a
metallic
sheen
to
it
not
quite
beads
but
lots
of
large
healthy
bubbles
swirling
upwards
inside
the
glass
excellent
balance
between
malts
and
hops
in
the
nose
cocoa
hard
coffee
candy
and
malted
milk
balls
interplay
with
sweet
pink
grapefruit
pine
sap
lemongrass
and
a
pinch
of
white
pepper
basic
apricot
peach
to
pineapple
fruit
yet
restrained
as
it
gets
warmer
the
damp
herbal
matter
element
becomes
more
pronounced
fullbodied
the
buoyant
carbonation
frames
the
attack
and
makes
it
less
blockish
and
more
apt
to
settle
gently
on
the
tongue
while
the
texture
is
dry
and
after
45
sips
you
start
to
feel
a
tacky
residue
building
up
the
flavors
are
all
ripe
sweetness
especially
that
pink
grapefruit
to
tangelo
citrus
floral
piney
sweet
and
sour
enough
to
play
up
papaya
and
pineapple
over
the
apricot
and
peach
some
biscuit
notes
among
the
caramel
and
molasses
as
in
the
nose
saves
the
more
bitter
or
leafy
herbaceousness
for
last
given
the
multitude
of
things
going
on
stays
balanced
and
integrated
and
even
better
highly
drinkable
i
am
pretty
confident
alesmith
does
not
make
a
single
bad
beer
but
they
sure
have
the
reds
nailed
down
between
this
and
evil
deadbloody
valentine
while
this
is
exactly
what
the
brewers
wanted
to
make
it
is
just
a
bit
to
big
for
me
really
not
bad
for
what
it
is
just
the
large
bitterness
mixed
with
the
big
burnt
sugary
character
are
not
really
for
me
i
want
something
a
bit
cleaner
for
me
to
drink
this
more
often
still
at
least
worth
a

with

another
very

from

o
excellent

i
rank
this
right
there
with
my
favorite
imperial
red
ales
glad
to
recommend
overall
a
very
solid
imperial
red
ale
big
oily
mix
of
earthy
hops
with
a
big
sweet
malt
presence
theres
a
lot
of
red
ink
on
a
brown
bottle
i
cant
read
it
on
the
bottom
above
the
web
address
it
says
serve
in
a
pint
at
5055
degrees
i
think
the
temperature
is
okay
but
is
a
pint
really
what
you
want
to
recommend
whatever
i
did
it
in
a
tulip
so
sorry
a
simplistic
but
well
crafted
hoppy
red
ale
i
would
love
more
dimensions
thrown
in
in
either
the
malt
or
hops
malt
is
equally
balanced
with
the
hops
so
there
isnt
much
that
can
be
done
about
the
rising
alcohol
a
nice
beer

piney
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
biscuit
as
it
warms
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
strongly
bitter
with
significant
sweet
malt
and
brown
sugar
to
offset
it
balance
doesnt
shift
much
as
it
warms
subtle
hints
of
orange
peel
and
pine
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
id
expect
from
8
5
bordering
on
what
id
expect
from
an
imperial
red
overall
very
nice
effort
hoppy
but
not
too
hoppy
very
attractive
appearance
o
im
impressed
with
the
winter
and
summer
versions
of
this
beer
buy
again
most
definately
overall
really
good
full
flavored
but
not
quite
what
id
call
a
red
ale
sure
i
get
the
hops
but
with
the
roasty
malts
and
alcohol
the
beer
seems
closer
to
a
barleywine
to
me
still
really
tasty
and
great
to
drink
o
yulesmith
isnt
brewed
with
spices
or
special
yeast
like
most
holiday
beers
rather
alesmith
got
creative
and
used
american
hop
varieties
that
introduce
overtones
of
pine
and
earthy
characteristics
which
in
conjunction
with
the
toasted
amber
and
sweet
caramel
malts
make
for
a
seasonally
enjoyable
amber
ale
kind
of
like
your
fallback
after
your
fallback
doesnt
pick
up
yeah
ill
drive
over
at
midnight
but
im
not
exactly
stoked
o
very
good
imperial
red
definitely
one
to
throw
in
the
winter
rotation
with
sn
celebration
gl
christmas
and
lakefront
holiday
spice
overall
nothing
jaw
dropping
but
still
a
solid
beer
well
done
this
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
fresh
hops
the
taste
is
amazing
with
a
bold
yet
not
overpowering
taste
of
hops
and
hidden
citrus
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
malt
and
dry
hop
after
taste
a
very
well
made
double
ipa
starts
off
with
bready
biscuit
notes
followed
by
some
mild
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
that
balance
the
brew
out
then
the
hop
grassyness
and
piney
notes
come
in
well
balanced
and
not
too
intense
a
perfect
balance
of
piney
resinous
and
dank
hops
with
some
amazing
rich
caramel
malt
notes
the
body
in
this
brew
is
great
mediumlight
body
with
nice
sticky
notes
overall
this
brew
is
delicious
one
of
the
better
imperial
reds
out
there
the
balance
between
yummy
caramel
malts
and
the
resinous
and
dank
pine
hops
is
pretty
amazing
o
a
very
nice
seasonal
offering
reminiscent
of
celebration
ale
but
with
a
stronger
malt
bill
and
higher
gravity
classic
seasonalwinter
warmerkinda
flavors
no
reason
not
to
check
this
out
d
tasty
hoppy
red
ale
had
this
in
07
and
dont
remember
it
being
this
hoppy
must
have
been
an
older
bottle
definitely
drink
this
one
fresh
review

this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
alesmith
its
not
too
flashy
and
its
pretty
traditional
for
a
hopped
up
red
ale
its
fitting
for
the
cold
weather
it
was
nice
to
revisit
this
one
a
perfect
warmer
for
the
harsh
unforgiving
winter
weather
of
southern

o
i
love
it
when
a
gamble
pays
off
this
is
a
tasty
brew
wonderful
for
the
holidays
or
anytime
having
it
now
as
a
summer
refresher
and
it
works
for
that
o
it
has
kind
of
taken
on
the
characteristics
of
a
barleywine
the
hops
have
faded
but
are
fighting
to
keep
a
counterbalance
to
the
sweetness
o
this
exceptional
beer
may
be
as
good
as
imperial
reds
get
o
pretty
good
a
nice
little
holiday
piece
i
normally
dont
like
black
licorice
but
it
worked
well
in
this
beer
recommended
d
good
hoppy
red
ale
good
hop
profile
and
bitterness
overall
a
good
seasonally
flavoured
beer
a
little
too
earthy
for
me
but
still
nice
nonetheless
just
a
bit
overpriced
for
what
you
get
in
my
opinion
nice
to
have
tried
but
not
something
id
buy
again
awesome
stuff
here
my
first
from
alesmith
and
a
gem
of
a
brew
makes
me
think
of
nugget
nectar
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
them
o
this
is
pretty
good
sort
of
disappointed
mine
tastes
like
its
old
and
the
hops
have
faded
away
which
i
dont
see
being
possible
because
this
is
a
winter
brew
and
its
the
heart
of
winter
regardless
this
beer
is
well
made
and
not
too
shabby
deep
ruby
red
in
color
with
an
orangish
hue
and
good
clarity
poured
with
a
huge
dense
offwhite
foam
with
excellent
staying
power
that
left
random
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
fresh
pungent
citrus
and
ripe
grapfruit
hop
aromas
with
intense
sugary
sweet
caramel
malt
beneath
light
fresh
pine
hop
aromas
float
overtop
medium
bodied
with
a
thick
oily
feel
underneath
the
rich
tight
carbonation
a
fabulous
balance
of
pungent
hops
and
sweet
sticky
caramel
malt
the
balance
of
these
intense
flavors
is
the
beauty
of
these
beer
overall
a
beer
that
is
almost
if
not
an
imperial
ipa
has
every
quality
of
it
that
makes
this
beer
a
true
gem
not
only
does
it
improve
with
every
sip
it
becomes
more
addicting
i
thank
a
very
special
person
for
this
brew
and
you
should
be
thanking
yourself
just
for
having
it
salud
mouthfeel
is
decent
medium
to
fuller
bodied
moderate
carbonation
as
i
mentioned
above
pretty
resiny
but
smoothes
out
as
it
warms
i
would
definitely
recommend
drinking
this
one
closer
to
room
temperature
good
hoppy
amber
beer
a
bold
winter
beer
possibly
my
favorite
of
the
season
so
far
pours
rich
red
in
color
and
appears
to
be
an
irish
red
all
the
way
huge
lacey
tan
head
and
a
nose
of
clove
and
nutmeg
dry
red
malt
alcohol
and
a
majorly
aggressive
hopping
i
taste
hops
first
and
i
taste
hops
last
this
might
as
well
be
a
red
ipa
rather
than
a
holiday
beer
because
to
me
this
is
very
very
hoppy
for
a
christmas
brew
which
i
appreciate
greatly
the
spice
doesnt
come
in
until
the
end
and
is
relaxed
compared
to
so
many
winter
warmers
and
the
like
the
spice
also
seems
to
be
tamed
by
the
addition
of
something
a
little
sweet
vanilla
brown
sugar
maybe
some
belgian
candy
sugar
in
small
dose
it
really
rounds
out
the
beer
nicely
and
are
nice
materials
over
the
red
malt
foundation
theres
a
nice
full
body
enough
bubbles
and
a
warming
alcohol
sting
a
nice
bomber
to
share
or
to
drink
alone
on
a
cold
winters
night
i
enjoyed
this
as
much
as
any
winter
seasonal
this
year
ill
definitly
will
not
hesitate
for
the
summer
version
o
a
desert
beer
no
doubt
good
carmel
flavor
that
i
really
enjoyed
give
this
some
citrus
hop
flavors
and
it
would
be
wicked
overall
certainly
a
beer
that
would
be
great
paired
with
a
meal
has
the
malt
and
body
to
combine
with
meats
and
cheeses
but
also
a
pleasant
hop
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
and
interesting
amber
ale
this
could
probably
be
better
classified
as
a
strong
ale
still
pretty
tasty
and
while
not
particularly
smooth
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
beer
clocking
in
at
near
10
alcohol
more
citrus
o
great
beer
for
sure
but
my
heart
is
still
with
nugget
nectar
all
around
just
an
excellent
beer
have
another
bottle
im
saving
for
its
namesake
holiday
overall
one
real
great
tasting
amber
i
would
love
to
have
this
every
christmas
this
is
a
great
hoppy
beer
the
alcohol
isnt
even
noticeable
a
great
winter
beer
for
the
hop
head
o
a
very
good
holidday
brew
great
flavors
without
getting
to
fancy
and
overdoing
it
with
added
spices
and
such
good
balance
of
hops
the
summer
yuletide
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
now
this
one
joins
the
ranks
perfect
hop
head
choice
for
the
colder
season
would
def
get
again
and
adds
to
the
respect
for
alesmith
o
good
overall
very
nice
winter
seasonal
overall
a
big
but
wellbalanced
dipa
a
little
more
caramelly
than
i
generally
like
but
still
a
tasty
winter
beer
pours
a
clear
classic
amber
with
a
light
taupe
head
aromas
of
caramel
and
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
creamy
sweet
caramel
cut
by
the
tart
sweet
grapefruit
perhaps
a
little
eggplant
this
is
an
amazing
beer
despite
very
limited
cooler
space
i
took
a
bottle
home
very
good
red
ale
here
highly
hopped
setting
it
apart
recommended
thanks
for
the
share

pours
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
some
herbal
and
dank
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
and
medium
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
strong
and
quite
dank
o
very
nice
imperial
red
has
enough
citrus
and
sweetness
to
balance
to
bitterness
glad
i
have
1
more
bottle
mo
medium
body
that
is
very
well
carbonated
the
aftertaste
doesnt
last
long
and
is
mostly
alpha
acid
bittering
and
some
malt
finishes
semidry
on
the
palate
overall
this
beer
is
wonderful
one
of
the
best
amberred
ales
imo
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
drink
it
and
drink
it
often
the
only
gripe
i
have
is
that
it
comes
out
too
early
to
be
a
holiday
ale
so
confused
overall
i
was
all
okay
old
hoppy
beer
i
know
people
say
this
ages
nice
but
man
this
was
amazing
tasting
i
fucking
love
it
when
a
beer
blows
me
away
like
this
id
call
it
an
american
strong
ale
it
has
more
barleywine
flavors
and
its
too
good
to
be
any
kind
of
a
red
ale
a
classic
christmas
beer
whatever
the
style
from
the
22
oz
bottle
decent
beer
but
it
drinks
like
an
american
barleywine
not
an
amberred
doa
o
a
solid
beer
it
tastes
kind
of
familiar
but
in
a
good
way
2010
bottle
sampled
in
late
2011
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
deep
somewhat
murky
red
brown
amber
thin
offwhite
head
leaves
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
herbal
hops
caramel
malt
some
citrus
flavor
follows
with
citrus
and
piney
hops
sweet
and
caramel
malt
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
the
hops
are
somewhat
muted
perhaps
because
this
is
six
month
old
bottle
medium
to
heavy
bodied
and
creamy
nicely
made
but
the
hops
seem
tired
and
aged
worth
checking
a
newer
bottle
strong
malt
flavor
upfrontlots
of
crystal
is
there
such
a
thing
as
semisweet
caramel
thats
what
the
initial
taste
is
to
me
little
sweetness
but
still
some
buttery
flavors
the
swallow
features
the
hop
lightly
bitter
there
is
a
unique
balance
of
caramel
and
pepper
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
rich
and
slightly
oily
from
the
high
alcohol
content
i
was
initially
dissappointed
to
see
that
id
traded
for
the
2010
version
but
this
turned
out
to
be
mighty
nice
indeed
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
the
8
5
abv
is
only
barely
noticable
id
planned
to
drink
half
tonight
finish
tomorrow
but
it
was
too
good
to
stop
drinking
if
its
this
good
14
months
old
im
sure
the
hop
character
in
a
fresh
bottle
would
be
absolutely
phenominal
this
is
my
second
experience
with
alesmith
the
other
being
speedway
stout
and
i
am
thouroughly
impressed
this
comes
highly
reccomended
i
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
more
alesmith
brews
in
the
future
anyone
out
there
want
to
send
some
to
georgia
o
this
tasted
like
a
barleywine
brewed
with
cherries
i
really
need
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
just
great
and
everyone
who
is
a
fan
of
barleywines
should
give
this
a
try
o
a
nice
beer
on
a
cold
day
but
not
something
that
i
would
put
in
my
regular
rotation
of
favorites
pleasant
but
not
fantastic
o
a
good
warming
beer
sos
one
of
the
better
reds
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
overall
this
one
was
chalked
full
of
spice
definitely
a
beer
that
ill
search
out
in
the
future
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
just
wish
the
hoppiness
and
citrus
notes
in
the
nose
translated
over
to
the
taste
a
but
better
that
is
a
bit
of
a
nit
pick
though
this
is
very
solid
this
was
a
very
good
beer
there
was
so
much
flavor
and
very
nicely
balanced
i
didnt
take
much
effort
for
me
to
finish
of
this
bomber
this
is
a
creamy
highly
hopped
brew
that
goes
down
smooth
and
warm
a
very
nice
christmas
fireside
beer
no
real
gimmicks
here
for
a
holiday
ale
just
a
very
well
crafted
and
big
amber
ale
overall
4
5
i
was
not
let
down
by
this
one
perfectly
hoppy
with
a
great
caramel
backbone
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
very
balanced
and
tasty
big
malt
big
hops
and
a
good
dose
of
booze
that
stays
pretty
well
hidden
o
one
of
the
better
red
ales
i
have
ever
had
alesmith
did
an
amazing
job
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
incredibly
good
beer
hoppy
reds
are
my
favorite
and
this
one
is
only
beat
by
a
handful
of
others
ive
had
before
i
liked
it
better
than
the
summer
edition
nice
amber
ale
plenty
of
hops
thats
for
sure
easy
to
drink
consistent
and
no
scrimping
on
ingredients
get
it
while
you
can
hv
o
of
the
style
imperial
red
not
just
red
ale
this
is
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
alesmith
just
makes
good
quality
brews
overall
real
nice
imperial
red
and
the
cask
really
brought
out
the
hops
nicely
o
quite
the
interesting
brew
that
sits
on
the
bitter
side
of
an
imperial
amber
style
i
like
it
but
find
myself
thinking
that
if
i
want
an
imperial
stout
ill
have
that
or
if
i
want
an
imperial
ipa
ill
have
that
this
sits
between
the
two
in
a
way
ive
not
experienced
before
perhaps
as
i
become
more
familiar
with
this
style
ill
appreciate
this
brew
even
more
overall
a
spectacular
beer
i
really
wish
they
made
this
in
a
sixpack
i
find
it
hard
to
justify
paying
this
much
for
a
bomber
of
a
beer
more
than
once
or
twice
which
is
a
pity
because
this
is
a
truly
delicious
beer
very
good
beer
that
brings
me
back
every
year
big
ale
i
let
this
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
then
poured
it
with
a
large
thick
fluffy
foamy
textured
cream
colored
fairly
long
lasting
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
hazy
apricot
red
aroma
is
hops
malt
raisins
prunes
caramel
flavor
is
very
similar
to
nose
with
bittersweetness
on
top
with
other
qualities
below
great
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
resiny
and
long
well
done
but
too
much
for
me
kudos
as
usual
to
alesmith
for
producing
a
solid
example
of
the
style
well
formed
malt
backbone
that
offers
up
a
varied
toasted
character
and
plenty
of
hops
to
lend
balance
and
keep
me
back
for
another
sip
no
problems
finishing
the
bomber
on
my
own
and
wouldnt
have
issues
grabbing
another
to
follow
dr
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
though
alcohol
does
unfortunately
come
through
id
like
to
try
it
on
draught
it
does
lack
a
clear
focus
but
i
enjoy
drinking
it
some
beautiful
spicy
hops
with
chocolate
notes
in
the
nose
taste
is
again
very
spicy
hops
and
it
also
has
a
heatlike
character
that
is
striking
and
a
little
undesirable
for
me
a
large
maltbackbone
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
im
much
happier
to
be
nursing
a
bottle
of
this
than
many
things
i
couldve
bought
but
dont
think
it
stands
up
to
yulesmith
summer
or
any
truly
great
ambers
overall
a
solid
hoppy
red
ale
from
alesmith
though
at
9
a
bottle
i
dont
think
ill
revisit
this
format
overall
this
beer
kicks
ass
i
enjoyed
the
summer
yulesmith
but
this
one
is
just
a
lot
better
tasting
and
not
as
boozy
mucho
recommendo
odthis
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
i
love
the
style
i
would
have
originally
said
that
i
like
yulesmith
summer
better
than
this
but
i
found
this
summers
batch
to
be
far
less
extraordinary
than
previous
years
this
being
my
first
yulesmith
winter
i
must
say
i
am
quite
impressed
hoppy
and
delicious
o
good
but
the
aroma
taste
and
hop
profile
are
somewhat
one
dimensional
i
thought
the
summer
yulesmith
was
incredible
so
this
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
o
this
was
a
fairly
interesting
beer
was
a
bit
more
than
a
typical
amberred
ale
a
definate
winter
ale
cross
over
this
was
fairly
tasty
beer
like
the
hop
and
malt
profile
on
this
one
o
overall
this
is
a
great
style
go
imperial
red
ipas
i
am
actually
brewing
one
right
now
so
this
was
interesting
more
a
hop
forward
brew
but
somehow
it
got
balanced
out
with
malts
great
sipper
and
would
be
great
for
the
holidays
will
buy
more
bought
fresh
straight
from
the
brewery
a
good
take
on
a
red
ale
good
flavors
coming
from
all
sides
with
exceptional
balance
i
like
the
summer
yulesmith
a
little
better
i
think
but
a
nice
beer
to
look
forward
to
each
year
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
looking
clear
red
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
retention
wasnt
too
bad
and
neither
was
the
lacing
t
found
the
aroma
of
this
beer
to
be
really
nicely
hopped
and
has
no
elements
of
being
a
winter
ale
at
all
the
taste
of
this
brew
was
a
little
bit
like
a
nugget
nectar
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
and
had
a
light
oily
feel
to
it
overall
this
brew
was
good
but
i
like
the
summer
version
much
more
deuce
to
bottle
new
arrival
winter
2011
at
dutchs
the
best
spot
in
cincinnati
smell
is
good
reminds
me
of
90
minute
tastes
good
too
it
doesnt
redefine
its
genre
but
at
the
same
time
its
unique
and
one
ill
seek
out
when
tis
the
season
mouthfeel
is
probably
its
best
attribute
surprisingly
drinkable
for
8
5
overall
a
good
beer
that
will
do
great
with
limited
release
ill
buy
it
occasionally
as
opposed
to
never
if
it
was
available
all
of
the
time
as
a
redamber
ale
this
one
shines
but
i
can
see
this
one
being
tough
to
have
a
lot
of
works
well
as
a
winter
warmer
as
its
a
nice
big
meal
of
a
beer
that
makes
you
not
mind
being
holed
up
in
a
warm
house
on
a
cold
night
really
solid
winter
beer
they
did
not
spare
any
hops
on
this
one
amberred
color
with
medium
carbonation
nice
aroma
of
big
citrusy
hops
maybe
some
pineapple
notes
with
caramel
malt
and
maybe
some
spice
complex
flavor
profile
with
spices
citrus
and
pine
spices
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
fairly
full
palate
excellent
2006
winter
this
is
a
very
nice
highquality
beer
it
tastes
fairly
similar
to
arrogant
bastard
its
appearance
is
a
little
cloudier
and
more
orange
less
red
than
arrogant
bastard
though
it
is
malty
hoppy
a
little
nutty
and
slightly
spicy
the
aroma
is
quite
strongstronger
than
the
taste
the
head
was
very
thick
and
lasted
forever
at
8
5
one
bottle
22
oz
leaves
you
feeling
perfectly
buzzed
without
being
really
drunk
i
will
look
forward
to
this
every
holiday
season
from
now
on
enjoy
it
if
you
can
find
it
o
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
well
done
and
entirely
drinkable
o
i
like
the
fresh
winter
yulesmith
a
lot
but
the
aged
version
is
working
well
here
if
you
like
aged
american
barleywines
you
will
love
it
at
this
stage
having
had
it
fresh
enough
i
can
tell
you
it
works
great
fresh
as
well
a
beer
thats
been
creeping
up
in
price
gone
up
from
around
4
50
to
8
in
the
few
years
ive
been
drinking
it
nevertheless
its
a
christmas
classic
and
i
plan
to
buy
it
every
year
o
solid
red
ale
which
i
originally
thought
was
a
dipa
but
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
liking
one
bomber
was
plenty
for
me
as
this
beer
drinks
closer
to
10
abv
rather
than
the
8
5
as
indicated
on
the
bottle
at
17
50
a
bomber
in
philly
i
feel
this
is
overpriced
guess
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
a
top
tier
brewery
with
a
premium
price
such
as
alesmith
o
a
good
amber
ale
i
wish
i
could
try
this
a
touch
fresher
still
tasty
though
a
tasty
somewhat
bitter
and
piney
amber
ale
a
wonderful
holiday
treat
o
packed
the
the
rim
with
lots
of
hop
flavour
but
well
balanced
by
yummy
malt
character
without
being
cloying
a
very
tasty
beer
indeed
a
treat
indeed
given
its
high
alcohol
and
general
unavailability
here
in
australia
a
pretty
good
late
to
be
had
beer
i
can
see
that
bottle
was
older
than
it
should
have
been
with
the
sediment
clusters
at
the
bottle
pour
is
red
amber
darkness
nose
of
toffee
palate
of
toffee
predominately
the
nose
has
some
bitterness
hints
of
tobacco
earthiness
with
a
hint
of
it
expanding
in
the
palate
as
a
earthy
brown
sugar
sweet
then
over
ripened
apple
then
gritty
husk
dryness
not
a
beer
to
be
had
in
the
heat
a
bit
to
syrupy
at
this
point
such
a
lovely
piney
hops
aroma
that
has
me
thinking
about
how
perfect
this
is
at
christmas
also
getting
some
caramel
malts
in
the
aroma
overwhelming
hoppy
pine
flavor
that
seems
to
be
a
perfect
combination
of
hops
and
malt
hints
of
nutmeg
is
that
just
because
its
christmas
eve
every
sip
has
me
wanting
more
highly
recommended
with
a
gentle
pour
this
brew
definately
looks
impressive
it
pours
a
dark
murky
orangeamber
hue
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
leaves
heaps
of
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
straight
out
hops
and
lots
of
them
with
aromas
of
honeycombstonefruit
and
toffee
aswellit
has
a
nice
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
coats
the
mouth
with
tastes
of
sticky
date
puddingbrown
sugartoffeestonefruit
and
finished
with
a
nice
dry
hit
of
stickypineyresiny
hops
and
a
touch
of
warmth
and
overall
this
is
my
type
of
holiday
brew
no
spicesno
gimmicks
just
straight
out
hops
and
malts
and
lots
of
them
definately
a
good
gift
for
xmas
or
anytime
of
year
the
pour
was
very
big
lots
of
dark
orange
colors
swirling
about
and
a
good
sized
head
of
white
reaching
up
and
over
the
top
to
around
two
inches
before
settling
back
down
again
really
nice
layered
look
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
was
thoroughly
coated
all
the
way
down
really
good
retention
here
i
have
to
say
lots
of
malt
in
the
nose
right
off
caramel
sweet
notes
mixing
with
a
very
big
hop
note
especially
as
it
warms
piney
with
a
sweet
orange
rind
like
citrus
touch
as
it
comes
close
to
room
temperature
very
thick
feel
sticky
and
full
with
nice
carbonation
definite
enough
to
get
it
done
initially
you
get
the
piney
hop
bite
as
you
take
the
first
sip
but
it
became
very
well
balanced
mid
palate
as
the
rich
almost
scotch
ale
like
buttery
notes
start
to
come
through
and
really
give
it
quite
a
smooth
flavor
a
bit
hot
still
and
a
definite
big
one
it
hurts
the
session
ability
of
it
a
touch
and
by
the
end
you
are
really
pushing
it
with
this
one
d
this
was
a
good
brew
i
could
see
looking
to
somehow
score
this
again
around
the
holidays
o
how
is
this
not
a
barleywine
whatever
you
call
it
i
like
it
malty
and
complex
in
all
the
right
was
but
very
easy
to
drink
a
bit
high
on
the
carbonation
up
front
balanced
middle
with
some
alcohol
showing
medium
bitterness
on
the
back
with
an
earthleathery
finish
medium
maybe
with
a
lean
toward
light
body
md
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
no
alcohol
presence
but
left
my
mouth
slightly
dry
a
solid
beer
i
do
like
summer
better
but
thats
probably
because
i
prefer
hoppy
beers
acquired
through
trade
poured
from
bomber
2010
brew
into
dimpled
mug
pours
dark
mahogany
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
on
top
it
was
short
lived
however
and
lacing
was
nonexistent
throughout
the
session
unlike
its
summer
version
aroma
is
not
as
big
as
the
taste
suggests
however
nose
is
caramel
floral
citrus
hops
malt
and
light
spices
taste
picks
up
some
mildly
biter
hops
a
variety
of
spices
roasted
malts
and
a
sweet
caramel
blend
medium
bodied
with
some
dryness
decent
carbonation
throughout
when
comparing
against
the
summer
version
this
brew
is
maltier
and
darker
in
color
but
not
necessarily
better
overall
in
taste
per
se
this
brew
also
does
not
fit
the
winter
concept
for
me
but
it
was
a
very
nice
imperial
red
ale
regardless
im
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
ill
trade
for
it
again
unremarkable
brew
from
an
otherwise
outstanding
brewery
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
low
overall
this
is
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
overpowering
combine
this
with
how
bad
the
beer
looks
and
i
will
not
be
seeking
again
skal
d
the
ale
doesnt
taste
is
a
9
5
beer
the
heaviness
is
hidden
behind
the
caramel
malts
i
prefer
the
fresh
zing
of
the
summer
version
but
this
one
does
alright
mouthfeel
is
fine
as
it
isnt
too
thin
and
is
fullbodied
enough
to
bring
out
all
the
flavors
involved
carbonation
is
well
done
too
not
too
strong
and
not
too
weak
drinkability
is
directly
linked
to
taste
in
a
lot
of
cases
and
here
it
suffers
due
to
the
lack
of
balance
the
abv
of
8
5
is
masked
well
but
there
is
no
denying
the
fact
this
beer
is
tough
to
down
sip
after
sip
4
0
d
like
the
09
but
a
bit
more
drinkable
due
to
the
mellowing
out
a
very
fine
holiday
ale
to
have
around
the
christmas
season
d
this
is
a
nice
ale
that
i
would
drink
again
only
if
they
would
release
a
2011
summer
version
d
nice
balanced
beer
appearance
wasnt
too
appealing
but
it
did
keep
a
nice
head
from
the
pour
fairly
strong
tastes
full
bomber
would
be
enough
as
it
was
pretty
decent
in
abv
6
99
a
bomber
from
bevmo
while
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
like
the
summer
version
its
still
a
decent
beer
the
citruspine
hops
flavor
paired
with
the
malts
produces
a
nice
winter
brew
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
other
than
the
looks
this
beer
is
amazingly
complex
and
tasty
with
perfect
balance
between
malts
and
hops
im
wondering
if
this
bottle
had
something
wrong
with
it
but
seeing
as
how
it
recently
showed
up
on
my
beer
stores
shelves
i
can
only
assume
it
was
produced
for
this
christmas
season
i
am
drinking
it
about
a
month
after
christmas
but
that
doesnt
seem
long
enough
for
this
beer
to
go
so
bad
i
did
send
one
of
these
out
as
a
trade
extra
a
bit
recently
before
i
actually
gave
it
a
try
hope
he
was
able
to
enjoy
it
more
than
i
did
complex
mouthfeel
really
as
a
lot
going
on
overall
id
have
to
say
full
bodied
rich
big
thick
and
id
even
say
a
little
chewy
its
got
a
bitter
finish
could
be
a
little
more
clean
overall
just
really
big
the
drinkability
is
really
good
a
nice
long
sipper
been
nursing
the
bottle
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
now
this
is
the
2nd
time
ive
tried
this
beer
and
the
first
alesmith
beer
ive
had
needless
to
say
ill
be
back
for
more
overall
a
decent
imperial
amber
ale
its
very
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
memorable
worth
a
try
or
the
price
tag
eh
probably
not
considering
how
forgettable
it
is
the
summer
yulesmith
is
exponentially
better
if
you
ask
me
a
truly
outstanding
brew
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
summer
version
appearance
is
fairly
spectacular
with
a
murky
rusty
copper
color
with
a
massive
frothy
light
tan
head
that
never
quite
fades
away
and
leaves
abundant
clumps
of
sticky
lacing
some
pretty
intense
chunks
of
sediment
knock
this
down
half
a
point
however
aroma
is
extremely
sweet
and
malt
forward
toasty
and
caramel
with
mild
citrus
hops
flavor
is
a
little
less
sweet
than
the
nose
more
bready
and
toast
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramel
citrusy
hops
are
present
in
the
finish
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
resign
in
the
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
at
least
carbonation
wise
and
ends
with
a
slightly
thin
finish
regardless
a
very
enjoyable
winter
beer
but
just
makes
me
want
fresh
nugget
nectar
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
giving
way
to
lighter
brown
edging
a
yellowish
to
off
white
head
is
present
this
beer
smells
very
sweet
like
candy
i
dont
get
that
much
bitterness
but
lots
of
malt
it
tastes
about
the
same
very
sweet
malt
lots
of
caramel
and
some
sugared
dates
not
sure
what
the
end
design
was
but
i
expected
more
hoppiness
it
is
ok
just
very
malty
and
sticky
mouthfeel
i
would
have
this
one
again
just
not
my
favourite
d
really
nice
i
like
this
better
than
the
yulesmith
summer
actually
goes
down
easy
no
trace
of
strength
here
well
hopped
and
smooth
cant
go
wrong
with
alesmith
recommended
a
fresher
version
of
this
beer
is
worthy
of
an
a
but
this
vintage
while
not
bad
definitely
shows
the
signs
of
age
still
pretty
damn
good
pours
a
clean
orangeish
yellow
color
with
aan
offwhite
head
aromas
of
a
citrusy
grapefruity
hop
in
the
taste
big
grapefruity
hops
and
a
great
balance
of
malt
in
taste
as
well
a
bittersweet
mouthfeel
and
a
sticky
sweet
grapefruity
hop
aftertaste
a
great
double
ipa
big
hops
and
balanced
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
overall
a
great
red
ale
one
of
the
best
red
ales
i
have
had
great
flavors
and
mouthfeel
overall
but
the
high
alcohol
content
and
aftertaste
takes
away
from
the
overall
drinkability
in
my
opinion
still
a
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
solid
i
feel
this
brew
has
a
lot
of
good
qualities
but
i
just
dont
see
much
hype
in
this
one
d
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
as
i
really
enjoy
the
summer
version
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
d
it
drank
good
and
went
great
paired
with
late
night
jack
in
the
box
jalepeno
poppers
i
honestly
prefer
the
yule
smith
summer
over
the
winter
though
a
full
thick
foam
sits
on
top
of
a
burnt
golden
colored
liquid
the
liquid
has
a
notable
haze
it
has
a
very
pine
and
grapefruit
hop
smell
candylike
and
malt
sweetness
mixed
with
a
solid
hop
flavor
beginning
immediately
with
the
fronttaste
long
lasting
and
lingering
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
there
is
a
remarkable
fruitiness
in
the
beer
half
from
the
hops
and
partially
from
the
fermentation
its
a
very
good
beer
well
deserving
of
good
marks
just
not
exactly
my
thing
d
a
very
solid
american
amber
red
ale
and
a
nice
departure
from
the
typical
winter
christmas
seasonal
i
had
no
problem
putting
a
bottle
down
by
myself
and
would
gladly
partake
in
on
occasion
is
this
were
a
year
round
offering
another
fine
job
by
the
fine
folks
at
alesmith
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
alesmith
offerings
somewhere
between
double
ipa
barleywine
and
american
strong
ale
i
remember
liking
the
summer
version
much
more
but
this
is
pretty
special
too
drinkability
this
is
a
diet
american
barleywine
a
subdued
malty
base
and
subdued
hop
notes
relatively
though
i
suppose
theyre
absolutely
high
by
other
standards
ill
agree
with
the
review
averages
and
say
that
the
summer
version
of
this
brew
is
definitely
superior
though
ill
also
willingly
admit
that
this
is
a
finely
crafted
beer
in
and
of
its
own
right
at
9
5
it
should
be
treated
with
respect
but
none
of
that
is
anywhere
to
be
found
in
conclusion
give
me
the
summer
version
anytime
but
when
its
off
the
shelf
ill
gladly
take
a
bottle
of
this
one
good
stuff
like
sculpin
meets
nugget
nectar
d
fairly
high
just
had
this
beer
on
draft
at
coronado
brewing
co
it
was
poured
into
a
regular
pint
glass
w
a
14
thick
beige
head
the
beer
has
a
very
strong
citrus
aroma
that
is
very
inviting
and
even
refreshing
for
a
holiday
ale
the
beer
was
very
warming
and
had
spice
notes
on
the
tongue
the
hop
spiciness
and
bitterness
was
well
balanced
with
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
what
i
would
expect
of
a
typical
holiday
beer
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
fits
the
christmas
season
on
the
ocean
here
in
southern
california
i
will
look
for
this
beer
again
yulesmith

pours
out
a
clouded
red
with
a
hint
of
brown
in
the
pour
yieldeing
a
dark
brown
look
in
the
glass
a
healthy
pour
yielded
nothing
in
terms
of
even
a
cap
a
nice
cap
appeared
over
time
with
dark
tan
suds
some
clingy
lace
this
has
a
nice
musk

it
it
has
a
winter
feel
but
is
not
boggled
down
with
spice
alot
of
toasted
malt
caramel
rich
candi
canes
some
dark
fruits
faint
hops
sweeter
as
it
warms
up
while
yulesmith
summer
is
hop
forward
the
winter
version
is
all
malts
with
hops
in
the
back
a
spicy
hop
kick
with
warming
blending
ever
so
nice
with
lucious
malts
goozing
with
caramel
slight
chocolate
and
fruit
taste
some
plum
and
a
candi
sweetness
a
nice
winter
red
here
without
the
spice
to
qualify
as
a
winter
warmer
i
like
where
its
at
the
feel
is
a
big
medium
thats
glidy
and
more
spicy
with
warming
carb
is
there
but
not
bitey
no
attack
on
the
tounge
at
all
while
maintaining
life
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
i
liked
this
i
would
not
call
it
a
treat
but
its
damn
good
beer
i
drank
the
bomber
with
ease
it
satisfied
me
well
with
that
said
bring
on
the
summer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
beer
enthusiasts
that
have
never
drank
it
before
but
if
youre
thinking
about
getting
it
for
someone
else
ask
if
they
have
already
had
it
youd
be
better
off
spending
your
money
on
a
founders
sixpack
but
its
worth
a
shot

a

good

pretty
good

very
drinkable
overall
a
really
enjoyable
amber
ale
that
definitely
quenches
your
hop
thrist
its
very
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
memorable
definitely
worth
a
try
though
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
might
pick
it
up
again
when
i
have
a
hop
craving
but
more
balanced
solid
this
is
a
bountiful
and
well
blended
recipe
of
an
ale
very
good
and
perfect
for
the
holiday
probably
the
best
holiday
ale
bottles
anywhere
around
bold
and
worthy
of
respect
this
beer
is
meant
to
sip
not
swill
not
for
the
timid
or
beginner
d
considering
this
is
an
alesmith
seasonal
it
should
be
this
good
it
is
a
fine
example
of
stylemore
nuanced

is
exceptional

thats
the
best
way
i
can
explain
this
one
from
start
to
finish
its
one
of
the
most
intrinsic
beers
from
alesmith
its
everything
a
winter
brew
should
be
d
this
particular
bottle
is
not
really
the
greatest
in
drinkability
with
the
weird
carbonation
situation
but
i
would
imagine
this
normally
a
very
good
easy
drinking

this
is
the
first
and
quite
possibly
the
last
beer
you
would
want
for
the
night
struggled
to
finish
it
after
already
having
had
a
couple
of
other
brews
poured
into
a
mcchouffe
tulip
this
was
quite
cloudy
with
no
particulates
noted
golden
to
orange
in
color
with
a
beautiful
thick
super
creamy
white
head
the
head
covers
the
top
and
sides
all
the
way
down
the
head
and
lacing
are
quite
persistent
this
beer
is
beautiful
to
behold
big
bouqet
is
honeyed
sweet
biscuity
floral
citric
and
resiny
a
vague
buttery
note
takes
the
nose
down
a
notch
but
im
sure
this
is
phenomenal
when
fresher
drinking
summer
07
version
now
very
wellbalanced
taste
between
the
moderately
sweet
malts
and
prominent
yet
super
smooth
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
phenomenal
has
a
rich
creamy
quality
to
it
with
just
the
perfect
carbonation
medium
to
fullbodied
i
dont
know
the
technical
aspects
too
well
but
im
guessing
this
has
some
unfermentables
in
it
which
make
the
mouthfeel
superb
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
taste
compare
to
some
pine
and
burn
caramel
has
a
dry
finish
with
a
balance
warming
alcohol
i
suggest
this
for
those
who
like
strong
ales
i
wonder
what
a
fresh
one
will
taste
like
i
wouldnt
want
to
age
any
longer
overall
it
has
turned
into
a
great
barleywine
could
use
a
little
more
age
to
let
the
hops
fade
a
little
more
d
like
a
wire
walker
this
beers
beauty
is
in
a
masterful
balancing
act
between
a
precipice
of
biting
hops
on
one
side
and
a
sticky
quagmire
of
malt
on
the
other
but
for
me
its
the
herbal
almost
minty
freshness
that
provides
the
twist
and
separates
it
from
the
the
crowd
while
clearing
the
way
for
another
jawdropping
sip
d
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
d
very
easy
for
a
8
75
beer
killed
the
growler
with
no
issues
a
little
tipsy
though
haha
thick
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
almost
chewy
drinks
like
a
barleywine
very
nice
beer
would
seek
this
out
again
d
this
beer
isnt
difficult
to
drink
but
it
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
given
the
alcohol
content
and
amount
of
bitterness
this
is
the
christmas
version
of
yulesmith
which
alesmith
calls
an
imperial
red
ale
22
oz
bottle
with
no
vintage
dating
the
beer
pours
a
highlycarbonated
hazed
crimson
laced
with
brown
and
topped
with
a
voluminous
fourfinger
tan
head
that
is
almost
frothy
at
the
base
finebubbled
at
the
apex
and
can
be
teased
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
loads
of
aroma
hops
contribute
citrus
pine
and
some
fruitywoody
notes
and
are
backed
by
caramel
and
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
follows
suit
nicely
but
adds
a
light
sweetness
and
some
late
leafygreen
hops
on
top
of
a
medium
tingly
and
dry
body
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
the
hops
have
a
huge
presence
but
they
are
not
overly
bitter
it
is
actually
quite
balanced
for
such
a
hoppy
beer
and
i
think
the
lower
abv
for
an
imperial
helps
them
to
accomplish
that
tasty
and
highlyrecommended
notes
this
beer
is
very
close
to
perfection
my
personal
preference
would
be
for
a
tad
bit
more
strength
in
the
hoppy
flavors
but
thats
just
my
personal
preference
for
hops
i
gave
a
friend
a
sip
and
she
said
wow
thats
a
dessert
and
that
sums
up
my
reluctance
to
give
it
a
5
in
taste
it
was
just
a
little
bit
sweeter
than
i
like
in
my
dipas
but
balance
really
is
the
word
to
describe
this
beer
balanced
and
smooth
highly
highly
recommended

fantastic
i
was
really
surprised
to
see
a
hoppy
beer
do
so
well
with
some
aging
christmas
in
a
bottle
dull
orange
topped
by
a
dense
cream
coloured
head
the
fine
bubbles
formed
sheets
that
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
juicy
grapefruit
smell
initially
followed
by
a
warm
pine
resin
aroma
theres
some
toasted
character
in
there
but
its
overshadowed
by
the
hops
great
balance
between
big
hop
flavour
and
malt
sweetness
pine
and
orangegrapefruit
on
one
side
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
graham
cracker
on
the
other
bitterness
is
controlled
throughout
and
alcohol
is
just
apparent
at
the
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
with
very
well
integrated
carbonation
the
fine
bubbles
create
an
exceptionally
creamy
texture
slight
warmth
as
well
at
first
it
seems
like
itll
end
up
syrupy
and
palatecoating
but
ends
up
being
surprisingly
clean
and
balanced
slightly
towards
dryness
big
hops
big
malts
and
great
balance
makes
this
a
winner
d
this
was
a
good
brew
i
dont
think
this
is
worth
all
the
hype
but
a
good
one
nonetheless

full

pretty

like

ales
22oz

this
one
is
a
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
huge
head
on
mine
the
aroma
has
both
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
also
some
floral
fruit
and
caramel
malt
notes
a
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
to
the
beer
predominately
citric
but
nicely
balanced
by
the
presence
of
a
slightly
more
than
medium
malt
body
some
caramel
malts
and
fruits
peeking
out
from
under
the
hops
it
has
a
creamy
texture
to
it
extremely
nice
d
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
ale
smith
but
still
a
decent
brew
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
good
blend
of
malt
and
piney
hops
i
probably
would
seek
this
brew
out
again
but
very
glad
i
tried
it
nice
winter
warmer
enjoyed
on
a
cool
late
spring
night
in
la
i
wish
i
could
get
this
back
in
chicago
for
a
fire
companion
dhides
the
alcohol
very
well
has
a
great
sweetness
to
it
with
big
hops
and
some
nice
malts
to
balance
an
otherwise
hop
dominant
beer
im
enjoying
this
quite
thoroughly
a
very
good
beer
and
one
which
i
intend
to
drink
in
isolation
i
e
not
directly
after
13
barleywine
founders
deca
next
time
dthis
is
a
great
drinker
and
only
wish
i
could
get
it
on
a
regular
basis
this
beer
does
it
all
for
me
and
im
kind
of
sad
now
that
it
is
gone
quite
drinkable
although
this
is
probably
mood
dependent
if
you
dont
want
a
huge
flavor
impact
on
your
palate
then
definitely
dont
even
consider
this
brew
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
a
hot
stew
its
too
thick
a
brew
to
compliment
chili
or
any
thickercreamier
soups
but
a
nice
piping
hot
spicey
vegetable
stew
would
be
great
d
sadly
this
was
not
enjoyable
at
all
it
was
way
to0
sweet
and
the
alcohol
flavor
was
too
strong
the
spicy
butter
flavors
in
the
taste
make
me
wonder
if
this
bottle
has
started
going
bad
as
it
stands
now
however
i
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
taste
toasted
breadlike
malt
character
with
big
fruity
and
candysweet
caramel
notes
as
expressed
in
the
nose
hops
are
aggressively
bitter
featuring
a
nice
pine
spice
hop
flavor
but
certainly
on
the
level
with
the
malt
finish
is
balanced
as
well
hops
run
more
grapefruit
and
the
toasted
malt
almost
chocolate
consistency
leans
towards
oily
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
caramel
becomes
even
more
expressive
d
a
really
good
imperial
red
and
i
was
very
glad
to
try
this
again
but
a
bit
high
in
abv
to
drink
alone
it
is
for
sharing
you
know
the
winter
holidaze
and
all
i
found
it
to
have
wonderful
hop
flavor
and
mild
spice
even
though
it
was
almost
2
months
old
at
the
point
of
sampling
i
can
only
imagine
how
it
would
be
on
draft
a
very
good
beer
from
a
world
class
brewery
winter
2008
well
lets
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
the
beer
looks
great
it
glows
amber
with
hints
of
redorange
around
the
edges
this
version
is
definitely
a
double
amber
ale
and
im
not
quite
sure
why
ba
doesnt
split
the
summer
and
winter
into
separate
entries
but
whats
done
is
done
the
head
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
great
gobs
even
a
sip
of
beer
leaves
enough
lacing
to
make
me
a
bit
confused
as
to
where
im
drinking
from
on
the
glass
the
aroma
could
be
a
touch
stronger
but
i
enjoy
the
subtlety
and
the
depth
of
malt
balancing
out
the
enormous
hops
the
hops
are
more
orange
than
grapefruit
and
slightly
piney
as
well
the
flavor
shows
off
the
enormous
amount
of
sweet
caramel
malt
used
it
gets
a
perfect
score
more
for
balance
than
any
particular
incredible
flavor
alesmith
manages
subtlety
in
an
enormously
hoppy
beer
which
is
quite
a
feat
and
deserves
its
recognition
neither
the
hops
nor
the
malt
are
the
best
in
the
world
however
the
balance
and
subtlety
are
striking
with
such
enormous
flavors
this
beer
is
not
what
i
expected
it
is
distinct
in
a
world
crowded
by
nearly
indistinguishable
enormously
hopped
san
diegostyle
hoppy
beers
i
dearly
love
many
of
these
beers
but
very
few
of
them
possess
yulesmiths
subtlety
im
thankful
that
ive
had
a
chance
to
sample
many
big
california
dipas
because
without
that
experience
im
not
sure
that
i
would
appreciate
alesmiths
efforts
that
said
experience
is
also
a
detriment
this
beer
would
receive
a
perfect
taste
score
if
russian
river
and
port
didnt
exist
the
hops
are
excellent
but
could
be
slightly
more
complex
i
lean
towards
the
floral
side
of
hops
like
those
in
pliny
the
elder
over
these
citricpine
hops
i
know
little
about
the
technical
side
of
these
beers
so
im
probably
misstating
things
on
the
other
hand
yulesmith
has
one
of
the
best
malt
characters
of
a
hopbomb
style
beer
that
ive
ever
tried
its
a
truly
great
beer
and
deserves
the
fuss
but
living
in
california
has
made
me
enormously
nit
picky
about
hops
ultimately
this
is
great
great
beer
and
a
must
for
all
hop
lovers
d
incredible
for
its

the
appearance
of
this
winter
yule
is
very
similar
a
huge
stiff
head
that
settles
in
a
rocky
pattern
to
3d
lacing
the
color
of
this
one
is
darker
a
seasonal
redness
the
smell
mouth
and
flavors
are
very
similar
cheers
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
hazy
redbrown
color
with
a
mediumsized
tan
head
it
had
a
fruity
aroma
as
well
as
some
biscuit
cherrydark
fruit
taste
bread
and
a
bunch
of
hops
nice
balance
sweet
up

and
hops
bitterness
at
the
end
great
beer
drinkability
an
above
average
amber
where
the
alcohol
hits
hard
this
is
the
first
alesmith
offering
that
has
not
totally
blown
me
away
however
not
a
bad
beer
just
one
that
i
am
not
likely
to
pick
up
again
sweet
up
front
nice
midpalate
character
and
an
odd
bitterness
at
the
back
its
not
as
bitter
as
i
expected
i
was
almost
expecting
a
dipa
in
flavor
from
the
aroma
the
malt
is
there
for
sure
but
not
the
bitter
second
taste
some
fruit
flavors
maybe
sweet
apple
overall
its
pretty
good
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
and
the
bitterness
is
growing
in
my
mouth
its
pretty
good
i
like
it
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
strong
orange
and
citrus
with
some
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
bitter
orange
peel
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
like
the
summer
version
a
bit
better
but
it
was
an
aged
summer
version
so
fresher
is
probably
definitely
better
with
either
version
of
this
beer
ive
heard
all
the
talk
about
nugget
nectar
being
the
best
of
the
reds
and
i
have
tried
it
this
past
month
however
yulesmith
holiday
was
the
best
red
i
have
tasted
and
i
will
be
happy
to
pay
nine
bucks
per
bomber
to
taste
this
again
well
done

my
previous
alesmith
experience
was
the
ipa
which
was
unfortunately
overcarbonated
but
nevertheless
delicious
yulesmith
was
a
much
better
drinking
experience
thanks
don
for
a
mega
want
thanks
for
the
chance
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
from
alesmith
and
a
rich
and
fullbodied
american
amber
but
the
aroma
and
complexity
left
me
wanting
a
bit
more
out
of
this
beer
worth
a
look
notes
merry
christmas
o
great
malt
great
hops
but
they
dont
work
well
together
sweet
and
hops
clash
has
similarities
to
the
stone
13th
anniversary
but
this
is
way
better
compared
to
small
pour
of
stone
13
and
it
makes
similarities
more
apparent
if
it
were
spiced
instead
of
the
hop
presence
i
think
the
different
tastes
would
work
better
together
serving
type
bottle
this
is
supposed
to
warm
you
up
on
those
cold
winter
nights
when
the
blizzards
have
snowed
you
in
your
heat
and
power
is
out
and
you
have
no
food
in
the
fridge
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
fill
you
up
and
keep
you
warm
bust
out
a
yulesmith
of
course
this
is
a
big
beer
very
malty
very
hoppy
very
delicious
this
one
you
gotta
sip
through
keeps
you
warm
every
step
of
the
way
drinkability
awesome
what
a
gorgeous
beer
notes
really
nice
beer
that
definitely
has
a
winterchristmas
feel
to
it
but
would
be
wonderful
anytime
of
the
year
so
many
flavors
that
mix
and
mingle
so
well
together
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
a
large
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malt
citrus
hops
and
pine
the
flavor
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
the
chewy
sweet
caramel
along
with
the
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
the
finish
is
bitter
and
long
lasting
the
9
5
is
not
noticeable
in
the
beer
at
all
which
makes
this
one
dangerous
as
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
im
glad
alesmith
is
going
to
ship
to
the
bay
area
straightforward
tasty
amber
ale
which
works
well
as
a
winter
warmer
ill
return
to
this
later
as
ive
still
got
an
08
that
may
have
some
interesting
changes
in
the
bottle
over
2
years
glad
these
have
been
broken
up
into
two
different
beers
on
ba
as
they
are
certainly
distinct
both
have
an
excellent
grapefruithop
aroma
i
prefer
the
summer
version
see
my
review
the
winter
version
is
much
more
mellow
on
the
hops
and
much
heavier
on
the
malt
a
bit
syrupy
d
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
being
said
i
would
put
it
second
behind
nugget
nectar
in
the
amberred
ale
category
i
can
buy
nugget
nectar
for
2
less
per
bomber
and
save
even
more
by
buying
nn
in
six
pack
form
so
it
suffers
in
rating
because
of
that
fact
somewhat
heavy
but
a
good
drinkable
dubimp
ipa
for
the
winter
season
another
great
brew
from
alesmith
nicely
balanced
and
still
interesting
mouthfeel
slightly
thicker
than
medium
body
slightly
sticky
medium
carbonation
overall
a
delicious
and
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
i
wish
i
had
liked
this
one
more
its
really
not
agreeing
with
my
palate
nor
my
stomach
perhaps
id
like
the
summer
version
better
the
diacetyl
and
alcohol
that
shines
through
just
ruined
this
one
for
me
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottlewinter
version
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
red
almost
black
with
a
big
long
lasting
sticky
white
head
there
is
a
pleasant
citrus
hops
aroma
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
big
citrus
hops
and
a
dry
finish
it
is
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
and
well
carbonated
a
very
solid
imperial
amber
this
will
do
good
for
a
winter
warmer
tho
overall
if
you
want
to
have
a
hoppy
hoppy
christmas
along
with
some
nice
yuletide
flavors
this
is
a
worthy
challenging

this
one
was

to
share
we
moved
on
to
a
milder

this

perhaps

taste

with
a

bit

coming
out
at
the
back
mouthfeel

mediumlight
with
an
oiliness
that
coats
the
tongue
and
an
assertive
background
carbonation
that
leaves
a
bit
of
burn
and
astringency
at
the
finish
as
well
as
a
residual
heat
that
coats
the
esophagus
a
very
good
beer
however
the
10
price
tag
was
a
little
steep
also
seems
closer
to
a
dipa
than
an
american
amber
still
i
would
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
the
summer
recipe
the
taste
is
very
interesting
but
not
sure
if
thats
a
good
thing
there
is
lots
of
hoppiness
here
but
there
is
something
else
to
that
just
brings
a
weirdness
to
the
beer
a
big
beer
with
every
attribute
screaming
imperial
this
beer
as
an
hot
alcohol
hop
and
malt
nose
its
a
full
bodied
beer
with
sweet

dark
fruit
plumcherry
accented
by
a
slight
roast
nutty
flavor
to
round
out
the
profile
true
to
its
red
ale
roots
it
is
malt
focused
with
the
hops
equally
balanced
though
not
hidden
the
alcohol
is
cleverly
disguised
behind
the
big
flavor
in
this
beer
as
a
big
beer
that
is
also
sweet
makes
this
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
the
high
abv
does
not
help
matters

here
would
probably
lighten
up

increasing
drinkability
and
improving
the
appearance
as
well
as
it
is
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
yulesmith
from
the
bottle
which
is
a
rare
occurrence
for
an
alesmith
cask
d
i
absolutely
love
this
it
is
certainly
not
as
bright
and
hoppy
as
the
summer
versionbut
it
is
much
spicier
and
mellow
perfect
for
the
winter
season
the
alcohol
is
apparent
in
this
brew
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
slowsipper
too
bad
this
brew
only
comes
around
once
a
year
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
no
question
about
it
i
hope
to
try
the
4th
of
july
version
this
summer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
this
glass
went
down
very
easily
i
really
enjoy
most
things
alesmith
but
really
enjoy
both
yulesmith
versions
always
a
treat
when
i
get
my
hands
on
one
of
these
i
have
had
this
the
past
couple
of
years
and
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
years
the
least
too
much
malt
and
i
miss
the
more
citrus
and
floral

flavors
with
lights

the
booze
really
comes

imperial

overall
a
nicely
crafted
imperial
red
im
guessing
that
if
you
want
more
hops
then
the
dipa
version
of
this
beer
has
got
what
you
want
however
this
guy
still
has
a
nice
punch
of
hop
flavor
and
is
also
very
smooth
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
strong

good
deal
id
try
this
one
again
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
id
had
the
summer
several
times
so
was
glad
to
get
the
winter
one
finally
yet
another
excellent
offering
from
alesmith
rotation
not
avail
in
tx
so
had
shipped
in
if
here
would
be
several
per
season
as
is
ill
try
to
get
a
couple
shipped
each
year
this
beer
is
one
of
my
holiday
favs
and
to
be
able
to
try
this
on
cask
was
a
real
treat
while
the
cask
serving
did
take
away
some
of
the
aggressiveness
of
the
hops
that
i
like
so
much
and
seemed
to
lessen
a
bit
of
the
spicy
content
to
an
extent
i
seem
to
remember
more
mint
in
the
bottled
version
it
more
than
make
up
for
this
with
a
smooth

and
its
overall

this
is
just
a

overall
an
outstanding

ive
only
had
a
couple
from
alesmith
but
theyve
been
very
impressive
to
say
the
least
like
the
bottle
says
this
really
is
deliciously
malty
and
hoppy
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
balanced
brew
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
recommended
my
bottle
is
from
last
holiday
at
least
so
the
hops
have
faded
but
i
still
find
this
very
well
done
i
would
seek
out
all
available
bottles
immediately
another
great
beer
from
alesmith
theres
very
little
these
guys
dont
do
well
so
glad
to
live
in
socal
drinkability
extremely
so
this
is
pretty
damn
good
and
something
i
would
expect
from
the
winter
version
of
this
beer
im
not
going
to
lie
however
when
i
say
that
the
summer
version
was
better
than
this
i
still
have
one
of
those
left
which
i
need
to
drink
asap
overall
a
very
nice
winter
offering
form
alesmith
and
fitting
it
is
a
bit
chilly
outside
right
now
and
this
is
doing
the
trick
to
keep
me
warm
my
only
regret
about
this
beer
is
that
i
didnt
buy
every
one
the
store
had
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
i
could
drink
these
until
i
collapsed
bravo
alesmith
this
is
evil
dead

not

definitely

this
was
an
excellent
beer
did
not
have
it
fresh
but
with
a
few
months
on
it
and
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
a
little
syrupy
as
i
get
to
the
end
of
the
bomber
but
nothing
unpleasant
going
on
very
good
and
highly
recommended

tremendously
well
balanced

that
hits
all
the

another
awesome
brew
from
alesmith
ive
noticed
over
the
last
two
years
that
the
differences
between
the
two
editions
seem
to
be
getting
more
pronounced
the
summer
edition
has
stayed
bright
hoppy
and
charming
with
its
palate
blasting
mindset
im
finding
this
one
just
seems
to
have
mellowed
too
much
yum
terrible
nothing
at
all
going
on
here
as
far
as
taste
or
smell
no
hops
no
malt
no
alcohol
nothing
was
even
a
little
skunky
bridgeport
is
very
unimpressive
brewery
my
lasting
impression
is
i
could
make
that
this
looks
and
tastes
like
my
attempts
at
creating
an
ipa
from
scratch
without
really
knowing
whats
what
i
suppose
what
i
actually
made
was
an
american
ambergood
to
know
using
a
nonic
pint
thats
whats
suggested
by
the
label
a
beautiful
shade
of
red
with
a
tannish
head
that
was
with
me
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
nose
is
fairly
dank
and
spicy
hop
character
is
very
vegetably
like
a
broth
made
with
carrots
celery
and
the
like
id
suggest
this
was
related
to
the
rye
but
ive
noticed
this
with
bridgeports
conviction
pale
ale
signature
ipa
and
hop
czar
imperial
ipa
as
well
in
the
red
and
the
pale
its
tolerable
good
even
but
in
the
others
its
overwhelming
decently
carbonated
with
a
relatively
high
viscosity
and
a
bitter
pepperlike
aftertaste
this
ale
is
surprisingly
drinkable
in
sips
not
gulps
with
a
snack
which
works
well
with
the
moderately
high
abv
a
balanced
amber
that
masks
its
abv
well
and
presents
a
balanced
flavor
between
bitter
orange
zesty
hops
and
toasted
amber
grains
the
rye
adds
just
enough
spiciness
without
drowning
out
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
serving
type
bottle
overall
not
a
bad
beer
unfortunately
with
no
bottling
date
that
i
could
find
i
suspect
i
have
an
old
bottle
could
be
better
fresher
poured
from

into

glass
amber

with
not
much

hops
and
bitterness
last
on

tongue
for
quite
a

not
an

beer
at

but
one
or
two
every
once
in
a
while
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
very
affordable
at
6
99
for

pack
in

will
buy
again
at
this
price
point
o
bought
a
6er
on
sale
for
5
99
a
more
than
fair
price
for
a
unique
beer
interesting
how
triple
hops
and
double
red
mix
im
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
red
ale
but
would
definitely
buy
again
for
that
price
overall
not
a
bad
american
redamber
ale
though
i
might
not
seek
this
out
i
might
have
this
again
if
offered
o
could
have
been
much
better
could
have
been
worse
i
expected
more
because
of
the
packaging
and
didnt
restrain
my
expectations
even
though
it
was
bridgeport
still
a
decent
brew
definitely
not
bad
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
smell
was
the
best
part
but
it
went
down
from
there
o
im
not
quite
sure
what
bridgeport
means
by
triple
hopped
with
their
double
red
ale
kingpin
but
i
assure
you
theres
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
hops
in
here
than
millers
triple
hopped
lite
either
way
while
exponentially
hoppier
than
that
bladderfilling
swill
kingpin
seems
more
balanced
than
anything
which
seems
to
work
out
great
sweet
bready
malt
provides
a
nice
body
and
smooth
feel
with
predominantly
earthy
hops
filling
in
the
gaps
and
finishing
out
with
dry
bitterness
for
an
easy
drinking
and
higher
alcohol
red
that
wont
destroy
your
taste
buds
in
the
process
food
match
as
the
flavour
became
more
fruitcake
i
began
thinking
about
christmas
ham
turkey
stuffing
and
roasted
vegetables
i
would
start
there
o
definitely
not
as
i
expected
with
the
triple
hopped
now
where
to
be
seen
drinkable
but
average
overall
a
pretty
respectable
red
ale
with
excellent
looks
and
a
good
if
unremarkable
taste
you
may
detect
some
rye
crispness
and
pungency
in
the
flavor
but
otherwise
its
the
hop
bitterness
that
is
the
strong
point
with
this
beverage
solid
beer
but
better
beers
out
there
pours
red
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipates
lemon
grapefruit
minty
earthy
aromas
from
hops
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
too
surprised
there
isnt
more
going
on
in
the
smell
department
being
triplehopped
and
all
thin
body
dry
finish
more
about
the
hops
than
the
malt
earthy
spicy
tangy
and
acidic
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
drinks
easier
than
most
beers
given
its
abv
overall
lack
of
balance
and
hop
bitterness
that
is
not
matched
by
aroma
makes
it
a
beer
that
might
satisfy
hopheads
but
is
heavy
handed
otherwise
overall
3
75
certainly
this
is
just
a
few
steps
away
from
an
outstanding
beer
the
taste
is
very
good
as
is
the
mouthfeel
and
i
would
order
round
after
round
of
these
if
i
could
find
them
on
tap
there
are
a
few
knocks
on
it
but
very
few
this
is
an
easydrinking
7
5
ale
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
red
ales
you
will
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
better
one
if
you
are
accustomed
to
a
certain
red
ale
that
starts
with
a
k
this
baby
will
blow
your
mind

entirely

not

but
there
are
better
in

dr
decently

relatively
high
abv
and
of
bad
quality
i
wont
have
it
again
i
dont
mind
kingpin
but
i
strongly
suggest
bridgeport
stop
advertising
it
as
a
double
red
ale
that
is
triple
hopped
surely
it
would
fare
better
in
the
mind
of
the
average
reviewer
without
those
unfortunate
monikers
or
conversely
they
could
do
the
right
thing
and
bulk
up
the
malts
and
doubledown
on
the
hops
either
way
changes
are
needed
the
purported
hop
profile
doesnt
really
flesh
out
beyond
rendering
a
generic
bitter
crutch
but
its
nice
to
see
the
rye
strutting
its
stuff
on
the
flip
side
im
loving
it
typical
good
stuff
from
bridgeport
thanks
for
the
nice
beer
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
given
the
reviews
but
grading
to
style
this
is
a
flavorful
interesting
and
wellbalanced
beer
that
stands
out
above
most
ambers
to
me
love
the
touch
of
rye
malt
too
overall
kingpin
exhibits
qualities
both
good
and
bad
not
bridgeports
best
but
not
their
worst
either
overall
not
bad
good
for
a
change
of
pace
but
not
my
style
of
beer
good
one
to
try
a
clear
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
big
light
tan
head
smells
vaguely
of
pine
cones
taste
is
initially
a
mild
sweetness
followed
by
a
big
earthy
piney
resinous
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
tastes
a
bit
watery
though
for
how
much
alcohol
it
contains
i
would
drink
it
again
though
final
thought
pricey
at
10
a
sixer
and
a
decent
7
5
abv
pick
this
up
if
you
like
reds
or
really
love
the
brewer
otherwise
try
this
on
tap
somewhat
sippable
but
somewhat
ordinary
im
going
to
try
adding
a
touch
of
wells

beer
to
this
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
very
slightly
sticky
overall
not
bad
at
all
overall
surprisingly
complex
twist
on
a
redamber
the
deep
fruity
flavors
could
be
balanced
a
bit
more
effectively
with
more
pronounced
hop
flavor
though
appearance
is
red
amber
in
color
with
a
healthy
head
stickin
around
awhile
leaving
fair
lace
smell
well
for
as
hoppy
as
it
is
hops
are
not
dominant
a
little
grainy
with
a
citrus
note
taste
is
fairly
true
to
style
but
just
with
more
hop
punch
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
spike
of
carbonation
nothing
to
exciting
but
something
different
to
try
the
taste
has
some
powdered
texture
upfront
and
toasted
rye
bread
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
the
middle
has
a
bitter
powdered
orange
peel
and
dry
grass
nitterness
to
it
the
finish
ia
dry
and
somwhat
metallic
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
special
overall
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
fair
amount
of
potential
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
it
i
think
its
the
tart
sourness
that
gets
me
the
most
maybe
too
much
acid
from
roasted
malts
i
dont
know
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
well
here
with
the
caramel
sweetness
and
the
earthy
bitterness
poured
a
clear
red
liquid
with
an
off
white
thick
head
that
was
well
retained
the
aroma
was
a
nice
malt
and
hop
aroma
well
balanced
the
taste
as
with
the
nose
is
well
balanced
malt
sweetness
balanced
with
floral
hops
the
beer
has
a
medium
feel
to
it
the
beer
is
smooth
clean
has
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
solid
and
interesting
beer
with
a
nice
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
alright
red
ale
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
it
doesnt
suck
either
so
its
worth
trying
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
snifter
a
deep
amber
color
head
was
off
white
and
average
about
two
fingers
head
dissipate
quickly
with
really
good
lacing
aromas
were
very
balanced
with
a
great
caramel
malt
smell
and
floral
hops
taste
is
balanced
as
well
with
malt
sweetness
and
great
balance
from
floral
flavors
feel
is
smooth
with
some
oiliness
light
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
fitting
in
the
style
though
i
would
have
appreciated
a
little
more
hop
flavor
and
carbonation
decently
hopped
taste
toffee
irish
moss
andor
malt
seemed
evident
mild
grapefruit
tinge
from
the
hops
hides
7
5
alcohol
well
for
the
triple
hopping
claims
falls
short
of
hoppy
expectations
but
still
remains
a
solid
choice
at
the
price
86
more
bitter
than
almost
any
red
ale
short
of
nugget
nectar
d
bitter
start
that
fades
quickly
to
a
malty
finish
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
this
ale
is
interesting
but
it
isnt
hitting
the
spot
for
me
some
more
complexity
with
hops
and
malty
sweetness
and
body
would
have
added
a
lot
it
was
worth
a
try
but
ill
look
elsewhere
next
time
overall
touts
being
triple
hopped
so
like
miller
lite
its
triple
hops
brewed
i
gotta
say
it
just
doesnt
come
together
for
me
and
theres
really
not
much
to
this
one
especially
with
a
name
like
kingpin
an
at
times
understated
spiderman
villain
the
beer
is
is
orangered
with
a
thick
foamy
off
white
head
that
hugged
the
glass
it
smells
like
a
fruitcake
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
most
dominant
aroma
of
fruit
is
peach
i
couldnt
single
out
the
rest
the
taste
is
sweet
then
bitter
with
flavors
toasted
malt
bread
lemon
and
pine
this
is
a
thick
fullbodied
beer
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
its
very
well
rounded
and
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
the
6pack
maybe
this
beer
was
poorly
stored
by
the
retailer
oi
could
drink
several
of
these
maybe
its
a
good
beer
except
when
that
corny
taste
rears
it
ugly
head
but
not
great
i
really
didnt
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
one
it
just
had
some
weird
flavors
going
on
that
im
not
used
to
i
wont
say
it
tasted
bad
because
to
each
their
own
you
know
it
just
had
this
bittery
sour
taste
that
left
a
bad
aftertaste
it
was
really
not
enjoyable
at
all
to
finish
and
i
did
the
sixer
bought
for
a
very
reasonable
6
99
i
dont
have
too
much
experience
with
reds
but
i
am
anxious
to
try
another
one
of
the
same
style
to
compare
i
definitely
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
but
i
couldnt
resist
a
7
5
abv
beer
at
such
a
low
price
i
should
also
revisit
the
bridgeport
ipa
as
i
do
remember
that
one
as
very
solid
o
definitely
closer
to
arrogant
bastard
than
miller
lite
ill
probably
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
given
the
price
i
feel
i
rated
this
beer
higher
than
average
but
i
also
feel
that
it
isnt
given
the
respect
its
due
check
it
out
for
a
nice
value
craft
beer
hearty
yet
easy
drinking
dominated
by
an
estery
yeast
flavor
manifesting
as
fresh
sliced
apples
pleasant
malt
complexity
crusty
multigrain
bread
and
honey
slighty
toasty
breadiness
and
apple
notes
seem
to
domintate
medium
bodied
and
easy
drinking
it
has
fortitude
yet
never
feels
heavy
something
id
drink
again
for
sure
seems
well
suited
to
cooler
weather
tastes
like
a
generic
amber
beer
though
a
little
stronger
than
most
not
worth
repeatbuying
but
it
does
make
a
good
endoftheworkday
beer
in
a
liters
amount
trying
to
broaden
my
palate
and
drink
local
checked
the
website
for
the
brewer
and
this
beer
is
one
of
a
couple
that
has
no
accolades
not
average
but
not
quite
excellent
first
off
good
job
on
the
new
labels
and
also
seeing
some
new
additions
to
the
lineup
this
is
a
red
ale
that
drinks
like
a
6
beer
the
hops
are
there
but
not
as
apparent
as
say
rocket
red
from
bear
republic
the
malt
really
anchors
this
brew
but
the
finish
is
a
little
rough
and
could
be
a
little
smoother
decent
beer
and
true
to
the
style
though
i
expected
more
hops
from
the
triple
hopped
part
on
the
label
o
big
malt
is
the
hallmark
of
this
beer
big
waft
of
fruitcake
and
wild
herbs
in
the
nose
mildly
hazed
deep
amber
color
shows
some
tiny
bubbles
those
same
bubbles
have
produced
an
epic
creamy
lacing
the
ale
is
not
shy
and
shows
off
its
lush
smoothness
right
away
while
the
malty
medium
body
holds
together
very
well
biscuit
bread
crust
and
a
hint
of
grainy
caramel
throughout
the
maltthis
beer
does
show
its
bold
red
ale
side
hops
throw
down
a
pretty
hefty
bitterness
brash
but
flavorful
fruitiness
suggests
ripe
apple
orchard
flavors
with
a
hint
of
golden
raisin
in
the
back
end
alcohol
is
warming
finishes
bittersweet
and
biscuity
a
worthy
encountera
bit
more
caramel
edge
would
do
it
great
but
a
good
drink
nonetheless
o
this
was
pretty
tasty
i
guess
i
like
a
double
red
ale
with
rye
o
was
expecting
more
from
an
ostensibly
hoppy
double
red
ale
perhaps
different
hops
would
have
improved
this
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
decent
its
not
necessarily
something
ill
be
rushing
back
to
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
im
a
big
fan
of
rye
but
this
beer
just
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
the
rye
is
nice
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
not
something
id
rush
out
to
pick
up
another
sixer
of
overall
an
ok
hoppy
red
nothing
too
special
though
the
body
is
around
medium
with
a
real
slick
feel
that
makes
it
seem
thinner
than
it
is
its
mildly
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
just
a
tiny
bit
dry
pretty
clean
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
earth
shattering
typical
bridgeport
nice
amber
coloring
with
a
1
finger
if
not
a
bit
weak
head
but
still
very
clean
and
strong
look
smell
is
very
sweet
biscuity
caramel
has
a
slight
floral
tangy
cereal
smell
gives
off
a
certain
pilsner
smell
for
sure
taste
is
kind
of
all
over
the
place
initially
very
weak
at
first
but
really
open
up
in
the
middle
strangely
an
aspirin
like
bitterness
hits
you
hard
in
the
aftertaste
and
really
sticks
around
the
middle
of
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
fruity
cereal
like
quality
actually
if
not
for
the
crazy
bitterness
in
the
end
it
would
be
quite
nice
fyi
i
love
hop
bitterness
but
this
goes
into
medicinal
territory
a
bit
undercarbonated
on
mouthfeel
and
also
a
bit
hot
for
7
5
this
beer
had
potential
but
they
really
lost
me
with
crushed
aspirin
for
the
aftertaste
i
expected
there
to
be
some
more
hop
oomph
from
this
beer
not
really
there
more
of
a
mild
earthy
hoppiness
swimming
in
some
grainy
maltiness
not
sweet
exactly
but
a
bit
boring
some
light
citrus
notes
and
fairly
thick
almost
soupy
in
the
mouth
disappointing
bitterness
has
plenty
of
bite
on
the
palate
but
still
lacks
in
hop
flavor
candylike
maltiness
is
a
bit
wearing
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
rough
shows
every
bit
of
the
7
5
toasty
but
almost
more
of
the
burnt
variety
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
the
finish
is
just
too
rough
to
qualify
as
a
delicious
craft
beer
pretty
lame
attempt
at
joining
the
double
or
imperial
party
by
bridgeport
i
just
cant
imagine
the
testing
of
this
and
whoever
thought
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
release
to
the
masses
very
mediocre
offering
easy
drinking
probably
a
beer
best
paired
with
food
one
and
done
for
me
the
overly
bitter
finish
makes
it
hard
to
enjoy
more
than
one
d
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
or
distracting
at
all
pretty
tasty
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
be
just
fine
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
14
off
white
head
that
dwindled
down
to
a
small
halo
in
a
few
minutes
not
much
of
a
smell
tasted
good
going
in
malts
smoke
biscuit
some
mellow
hops
on
the
back
end
and
the
warming
of
the
belly
with
alcohol
though
the
hops
are
not
too
bitter
they
linger
quite
a
while
overall
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
or
expecting
bitter
yes
but
hoppy
goodness
no
i
drainpoured
this
one
couldnt
get
past
the
sweet
malts
drinkability
this
beer
has
just
made
it
into
my
top
5
its
that
good
drinkability
if
you
like
very
bitter
finishing
ales
than
this
beer
is
for
you
if
not
steer
clear
overall
im
just
not
liking
this
one
i
really
dont
like
the
aroma
it
got
more
perfumey
after
it
warmed
and
the
flavor
is
just
not
balanced
right
i
think
the
liberty
hops
are
running
too
high
resulting
in
a
mouthpuckering
bitterness
coupled
with
that
perfumey
flavor
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
i
would
however
drink
their
café
negro
porter
though
that
was
a
good
new
addition
taste
there
is
definitely
an
initial
burst
of
bitterness
that
is
followed
by
a
little
sweetness
but
not
a
large
amount
of
either
the
taste
quickly
fades
but
leaves
vary
little
aftertaste
would
i
buy
it
again
not
necessarily
would
i
drink
it
again
yeah
i
think
so
draw
your
own
conclusions
based
on
that
pale
red
in
color
with
a
dense
and
rolling
tan
head
that
holds
its
own
for
a
bit
before
retreating
into
a
thick
frothy
covering
subtle
sweet
malts
and
grassy
notes
to
the
nose
initially
fleeting
light
fruits
and
florals
meander
good
mix
of
bitter
up
front
and
background
sweetness
to
the
palate
nothing
bold
but
it
all
fits
has
a
medium
body
with
a
near
creamy
core
which
is
followed
by
a
definite
crispness
enjoyable
albeit
a
bit
misleading
in
the
labeling
department
as
theres
nothing
double
about
this
brew
pours
out
a
translucent
copper
hue
with
dense
1finger
head
leaves
significant
lacing
emits
a
beautiful
hop
scent
citrusy
complimented
perfectly
by
the
sweetness
of
the
red
ale
malts
and
a
light
caramel
the
taste
is
bitter
of
course
hoppy
and
malty
somewhat
of
a
copper
bite
to
it
and
a
touch
of
booziness
tastes
great
actually
but
unfortunately
the
fullness
of
flavor
falls
off
at
the
end
it
has
full
body
quite
viscous
but
not
too
sticky
its
a
strong
brew
and
perhaps
not
the
easiest
to
drink
for
that
reason
but
i
could
drink
a
pitcher
of
this
with
beer
if
it
were
available
d
very
balanced
flavor
between
the
hops
and
the
malts
with
neither
completely
overpowering
the
other
with
that
said
this
is
a
slightly
boring
beer
nothing
special
going
on
i
have
to
admit
this
isnt
my
style
of
beer
but
i
thought
there
would
be
a
little
more
falvor
wise
going
on
again
this
isnt
the
style
i
usually
drink
so
im
not
an
expert
at
what
the
flavor
profile
should
consist
of
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
what
i
hoped
for
not
beckoning
but
slid
down
easy
enough
assertiveness
kicked
up
a
notch
in
the
flavor
but
the
alcohol
clashes
against
an
onslaught
of
german
style
hops
and
a
syrupyspicy
rye
note
this
beer
is
having
trouble
finding
its
identity
as
it
has
the
sweetness
of
an
amber
the
hop
profile
of
a
german
pilsener
and
the
body
of
a
double
ipa
i
cant
say
it
really
works
for
me
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
syrupy
and
sticky
on
the
palate
big
bubbles
of
carbonation
feel
gritty
going
down
not
my
bag
its
a
decent
attempt
but
has
too
many
stylistic
and
flavor
errors
for
my
liking
12oz

served
in

poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
hops
medium
bodied
malt
predominates
but
there
is
a
decent
hop
bite
bit
of
a
tang
that
was
off
putting
to
me
fairly
dry
on
the
finish
from
the
hops
this
didnt
do
much
for
me
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
not
nearly
as
still
as
the
appearance
would
indicate
as
full
as
a
big
red
ale
should
be
without
the
stickiness
of
some
imperial
ales
on
the
whole
a
very
drinkable
new
offering
from
bridgeport
while
this
is
obviously
an
attempt
to
compete
with
ninkasis
believer
it
fills
a
slightly
different
spot
in
the
lineup
by
not
being
a
complete
hop
bomb
still
its
a
very
enjoyable
brew
d
a
drinkable
beer
for
7
5
but
overall
a
forgettable
brew
d
great
drinkability
nice
and
light
but
depth
of
flavor
not
heavy
at
all
and
the
hops
and
bitterness
balances
well
with
the
sweetness
i
had
a
nn
last
night
and
cant
help
but
compare
the
two
this
one
pales
yet
again
another
bridgeport
beer
that
i
know
i
am
going
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
triple
hopped
double
red
ale
is
exteremely
well
balanced
with
the
hops
and
malts
definitely
shows
some
good
hops
but
it
isnt
so
intense
that
it
takes
away
from
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
in
my
opinion
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
coincide
very
well
with
neither
ingredient
dominating
the
other
flavor
is
generally
the
same
with
earthy
and
faintly
sweet
malt
notes
balanced
by
herbal
hops
nothing
stands
out
here
exept
the
overly
thin
body
barely
bitter
finish
recalls
the
six
packs
promise
of
triple
hopping
etc
not
worth
it
upon
reevaluation
a
few
months
later
i
found
the
dense
rich
head
significantly
more
pleasing
and
the
malt
profile
admirable
the
rye
really
added
a
different
dimension
and
the
beer
came
across
as
better
overall
still
though
save
the
liberty
for
the
american
interpretations
of
german
lagers
this
beer
pours
a
red
amber
color
with
a
slight
amount
of
off
white
head
that
doesnt
cling
to
the
glass
much
the
aroma
is
missing
theres
not
much
there
but
if
i
imagine
i
can
maybe
come
up
with
some
fruity
hops
the
taste
starts
and
ends
malty
but
very
plain
with
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
thrown
in
there
for
a
beer
that
is
socalled
triple
hopped
it
is
certainly
lacking
in
the
hops
big
time
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
overall
i
wouldnt
really
bother
with
this
one
unless
you
need
to
overall
this
is
a
competent
beer
but
some
tweaking
by
bridgeport
could
easily
make
this
spectacular
close
but
no
cigar
boys
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
slightly
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
the
flavor
is
that
of
red
ale
with
a
slightly
more
pronounced
hop
character
i
realize
that
may
seem
a
little
no
duh
but
thats
exactly
what
this
beer
is
the
malt
is
traditional
toasty
caramel
flavor
with
a
bigger
earthy
herbal
hop
presence
than
normally
expected
overall
this
is
good
but
the
hop
flavor
needs
to
be
blended
into
the
flavor
better
and
the
overall
hop
character
to
me
is
a
bit
one
sided

i
was
expecting
a
winner
when
i
opened
this
bottle
but
i
guess
this
brewery
got
so
big
that
it
doesnt
care
what
it
puts
out
now
not
terrible
but
wont
buy
it
again
even
though
it
was
fairly
cheap
d
drinkability
is

very

a

and
a
nice
nutty
maltiness
struggling
to
find
any

though
that
may
be
at

and
lends
a
rather

ok
on

smooth
long

peppery

overall
a
rather
simple
beer
far
more
simple
than
the
dessription
led
me
to
believe
slightly
let
down
but
it
really
is
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
it
is
a
forgettable
beer
not
much
on
the
aroma
but
a
full
flavor
sweet
malt
character
with
the
spice
and
tea
bite
indicative
of
a
good
red
its
certainly
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
done
just
right
it
definitely
needs
to
be
warmer
to
allow
all
the
flavor
to
come
out
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
i
expected
a

more

edit
every
bottle
after
the
first
didnt
have
the
funk
was
it
just
me
turns
out
a
much
more
smooth
and
bitter
red
as
it
should
be
little
filling
but
otherwise
good
their
yeast
just
seems
crazy
and
bubbly
somehow
i
kept
passing
over
full
sail
even
though
its
widely
available
and
i
kept
meaning
to
try
it
so
i
finally
did
its
your
basic
amber
which
at
this
point
almost
seems
a
little
boring
compared
to
some
of
the
experiments
that
are
out
there
but
sometimes
you
just
want
a
good
solid
beer
and
this
fits
the
bill
nicely
balanced
not
heavy
at
all
very
drinkable
o
it
is
a
quality
beer
that
didnt
cost
much
comparatively
and
the
flavor
and
feel
were
in
the
pocket
imo
i
would
recommend
this
one
and
would
drink
it
again
another
one
of
my
favorites
that
took
me
by
surprise
a
bit
heftier
than
you
think
itll
be
but
my
goodness
is
it
tasty
o
a
good
lager
with
clean
taste
and
piney
happens
overall
a
great
beer
o
theres
a
lot
to
like
about
this
beer
and
the
flavors
far
more
dynamic
than
i
expected
the
initial
sip
is
fantastic
unfortunately
the
finish
is
a
little
funky
and
unpleasant
which
i
hope
is
just
a
product
of
the
particular
bottle
i
was
drinking
however
i
will
most
certainly
buy
this
again
and
its
relatively
cheap
too
this
and
bells
are
my
two
favorite
ambers
medium
amber
with
a
half
inch
of
foamy
dissipating
head
foamy
lacing
a
solid
toasted
malt
scent
and
the
flavors
mirror
the
scent
malt
forward
full
bodied
for
an
ale
solid
but
unremarkable
very
well
made
and
it
goes
down
smooth
the
hops
are
just
right
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
overall
why
have
i
never
had
this
stuff
before
very
very
impressed
with
this
brew
ive
been
obsessed
with
riss
and
other
stouts
lately
and
wanted
to
explore
a
bit
into
lighter
colored
ales
glad
i
picked
this
one
at
random
poured
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
slowly
receded
leaving
abundant
lacing
down
the
glass
quite
the
nice
looking
amber
ale
scents
of
rich
malty
fruity
esters
low
levels
of
nuttiness
and
caramel
aromas
and
an
earthy
hoppy
and
yeasty
presence
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
very
rich
and
malty
bouquet
with
enough
of
a
hop
presence
to
provide
a
hint
of
balance
quite
nice
flavor
begins
malty
sweet
with
heavy
notes
of
caramel
sweet
bready
malt
and
very
light
bitterness
this
moves
into
a
little
bit
more
bitter
middle
with
nutty
malt
sweet
caramel
light
fruity
esters
and
light
toasted
malt
the
finish
is
malty
sweet
with
moderate
toasted
nutty
malt
light
caramel
bready
and
biscuitlike
malt
with
a
mediumlight
bitterness
aftertaste
is
nutty
and
toasted
malt
with
a
light
breadiness
and
bitterness
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
that
is
quite
rich
and
malty
but
balanced
rather
well
done
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
heavy
carbonation
and
a
smooth
rich
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
nice
session
ale
that
is
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
little
malty
amber
ale
it
smells
and
tastes
quite
rich
and
pleasant
and
feels
smooth
and
sessionable
a
nice
though
not
amazing
ale
o
one
of
my
favorite
ambers
an
excellent
sessionable
yearround
brew
o
very
easy
drinking
and
highly
enjoyable
nothing
about
the
beer
is
outstanding
but
nothing
about
it
is
bad
either
a
solid
american
amber
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
and
an
old
favorite
of
mine
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
on
sale
for
6

it
has
a

2014
a
little
over
two
months
from
now
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
today
at
my
local
whole
paycheck
foods
i
poured
it
into
a
pub
glass
it
had
a
very
nice
foamy
head
with
some
staying
power
the
appearance
was
dark
colored
i
could
definitely
taste
the
hops
in
this
one
full
sail
amber
is
an
very
good
beer
and
id
love
to
have
it
again
overall
still
a
classic
after
all
these
years
a
fine
earlyautumn
beer
for
a
northeasterner
like
me
o
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
deschutes
red
chair
or
a
hoppy
blonde
from
columbia
kettle
works
i
like
that
it
has
very
nice
flavor
and
feel
at
5
5
abv
ill
have
this
again
its
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
amber
notes
poured
into
a
clean
u
s
style
tumbler
from
a
glass
bottle
served
chilled
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
reddish
tint
and
very
minimal
head
smells
of
sweet
toasted
caramel
and
a
bit
of
roast
maybe
slightly
oxidized
the
taste
is
pleasant
with
perceivable
earthy
hoppiness
a
medium
amount
a
maltiness
from
crystal
malt
and
definitely
some
roasted
malt
in
there
too
a
small
taste
of
cola
nice
and
refreshing
carbonation
but
thin
body
overall
a
nice
take
on
an
amber
but
could
possibly
fit
in
brown
ale
category
too
i
am
copying
these
notes
over
from
ratebeer
it
does
not
require
as
long
of
review
i
tasted
this
some
time
ago
so
i
cant
add
anything
nice
flavors
but
nothing
too
exciting
coming
from
a
person
who
doesnt
like
ales
too
much
this
is
a
good
beer
very
balanced
taste
the
hops
are
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
perhaps
less
so
than
boston
lager
it
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
imagine
that
the
smell
is
what
bothers
me
to
me
the
smell
isnt
very
attractive
for
a
beer
but
besides
that
its
a
fine
beer
httpyoutu
beraxcbijexus
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
compared
to
fat
tire
the
motivation
for
this
review
this
has
a
bit
more
complexity
that
i
feel
comes
from
more
substantial
hopping
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
better
beer
than
fat
tire
by
any
means
both
have
their
place
however
it
certainly
lets
the
hops
come
out
and
play
more
assertively
yet
still
maintains
good
balance
another
good
amber
give
it
a
try
a
well
done
amber
ale
nicely
balanced
hop
and
malt
notes
i
had
passed
by
this
for
years
now
and
finally
realized
i
hadnt
tried
it
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
overall
a
rather
balanced
amber
overall
not
too
sweet
not
too
malty
and
not
too
hoppy
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
o
just
a
soso
ipa
o
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
i
like
more
hops
in
my
beer
and
i
am
going
to
seek
out
an
amber
ale
with
more
hops
i
really
enjoy
a
good
amber
ale
and
this
one
was
simply
okay
there
was
relatively
little
head
to
it
which
disappointed
right
off
the
bat
the
color
is
a
deeper
true
amber
with
caramelish
toffeeish
aroma
i
felt
the
taste
was
a
bit
flat
but
would
not
refuse
one
of
these
poured
from
a
tap
perhaps
it
was
the
bottle
pour
but
the
label
says
ridiculously
tasty
which
i
did
not
get
from
this
beer
cheeers
it
pours
a
murky
caramel
color
theres
a
slight
caramel
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
caramelmalt
profile
that
veers
overly
sweet
this
beer
comes
off
as
cloying
and
syrupy
not
one
i
expect
to
have
again
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
amber
ale
just
not
a
great
one
i
think
even
just
a
slightly
bigger
body
would
have
made
this
much
more
enjoyable
the
down
the
hatch
mouthfeel
reminded
me
of
a
light
american
lager
not
a
compliment
in
my
opinion
but
the
taste
and
aroma
were
far
superior
to
any
of
those
big
label
beers
thats
for
sure
this
is
a
beer
thats
just
as
poundable
as
a
budweiser
but
far
more
tasty
maybe
bud
should
buy
the
recipe
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
pours
deep
copper
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
behind

was
malt
perfection
breaddy
caramel
a
hint
of
belgian
and
a
dash
of
chocolate
some
fruity
hops
lightly
in
back
to
promise
a
little
earth
and
bite
subtle
and
enticing
in
its
look
and
nose
on
the
palate
its
heavenly
smooth
and
deliciously
malt
forward
without
heaviness
toasted
grain
sweetness
mellow
rich
malt
and
a
playful
touch
of
hops
bitter
and
oily
pine
to
keep
it
interesting
sweet
meets
bitter
in
perfect
harmony
as
it
warms
the
hops
add
a
little
spice
to
the
aftertaste
and
with
a
bitter
swish
it
finishes
long
yet
gentle
this
is
a
smart
and
well
turned
out
amber
one
i
would
go
back
to
again
and
again
it
kept
a
nice
flavor
in
my
mouth
each
time
i
put
it
downsort
of
a
nutty
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
having
tried
another
full
sail
product
tonight
i
feel
i
can
put
these
both
down
as
simple
reliable
beers
o
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
crammed
into
this
beer
it
over
achieves
somewhat
as
most
people
dont
expect
too
much
from
an
unassuming
amber
ale
one
of
the
best
readily
available
ambers
on
the
market
malts
lead
the
way
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
sweet
and
tasty
brew
i
like
malty
sweet
beers
caramel
and
dark
fruit
hints
hide
the
alcohol
well
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
my
last
in
new
york
before
rejoining
my
cruise
ship
after
a
day
wandering
around
and
drinking
just
a
good
hearty
beer
extremely
well
crafted
filling
and
refreshing
o
full
sail
makes
a
good
amber
a
balanced
beer
where
one
attribute
doesnt
outweigh
the
other
full
sail
amber
has
a
thintomedium
offwhite
head
and
a
slightly
bubbly
clear
amber
appearance
with
a
bit
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
fruity
brownbread
malt
and
the
flavor
is
of
those
elements
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
full
sail
amber
finishes
semidry
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
a
most
excellent
beer
rjt
a
very
enjoyable
beer
definitely
a
nice
amber
ale
i
poured
this
lovely
beer
in
to
a
pint
glass
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
the
traditional
choice
for
an
amber
ale
but
boy
did
it
work
right
off
the
bat
it
produced
a
very
nice
creamy
and
aromatic
head
the
initial
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
pure
yummy
the
beer
does
have
a
rather
strong
hoppy
aftertaste
for
my
personal
choice
but
that
is
not
uncommon
amongst
this
type
of
beer
this
is
definitely
a
very
good
quality
beer
pair
is
nicely
with
a
flavorful
curry
or
some
grilled
spicy
meat
not
outstanding
a
very
good
price
and
a
great
pair
for
flavorful
food
try
it
overall
between
this
and
the
ipa
i
think
i
am
loving
this
brewery
worthy
of
a
10
dollar
mixed
six
pack
this
is
an
excellent
amber
ale
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
some
caramel
taste
is
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
a
bit
of
caramel
tasty
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
a
favorite
of
our
patrons
down
in
the
panhandle
this
ale
registers
high
in
drinkability
and
overall
flavor
compared
to
a
fullers
london
pride
or
ccb
tocabaga
it
might
fall
short
but
for
an
amber
ale
id
give
it
a
chance
a
fair
addition
to
a
menu
paired
best
with
a
turkey
rueben
or
cheese
fries
cheers
i
want
my
beers
to
jump
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
and
as
such
i
am
heavyhanded
with
my
pour
this
was
no
exception
and
i
quickly
had
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
head
with
great
retention
staring
at
me
color
was
the
dictionary
definition
of
deepamber
plus
neplus
quality
to
boot
they
certainly
know
how
to
clarify
their
beers
in
hood
river
nose
was
nutty
not
nutty
like
me
but
more
like
pecans
walnuts
almonds
that
sort
of
thing
say
dont
i
remember
something
untoward
about
a
bitter
almond
smell
in
liquids
nah
i
must
be
mistaken
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
really
had
a
nutty
flavor
to
it
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
minty
hoppiness
to
go
along
with
the
nuttiness
noted
previously
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
unless
they
are
the
hot
redhead
giving
me
a
lap
dance
but
this
was
eminently
drinkable
now
if
they
would
just
can
their
beers
i
would
be
a
total
fan
a
solid
beer
thoug
ordinary
and
plain
but
good
overall
a
great
amber
very
approachable
and
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
the
beer
geek
in
me
satisfied
cant
believe
i
got
this
beer
for
3
99sixer
killer
steal
of
a
deal
one
of
the
first
amber
beers
i
ever
had
back
in
the
1990s
and
it
is
still
great
i
am
not
able
to
find
it
in
indiana
but
had
a
friend
pack
some
down
from
minnesota
for
me
just
awesome
o
the
aroma
on
this
beer
was
very
pleasant
i
will
say
the
booziness
in
the
flavor
was
a
turnoff
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
just
odd
maybe
something
was
off
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
this
either
making
it
a
decent
session
beer
for
those
inclined
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
while
not
a
bright
knockout
like
fuller
amber
and
red
ales
this
was
dry
enough
to
warrant
a
big
glass
of
water
after
the
serving
it
was
like
the
other
full
sail
beers
that
i
had
accessible
middle
of
the
road
and
sure
to
offend
no
one
while
being
a
good
take
on
its
namesake
style
the
aftertaste
had
a
slight
burnt
tone
to
it
making
this
a
great
choice
for
the
days
when
fall
is
in
full
swing
i
can
tell
there
is
lots
of
quality
in
this
beer
initial
taste
and
smell
was
great
i
just
didnt
love
the
slightly
flowery
and
bitter
finish
as
much
the
weekend
is
here
and
ive
purchased
a
six
pack
of
full
sail
amber
beer
the
appearance
is
darkreddish
with
a
tan
lace
a
quick
sniff
detects
an
aromatic
aroma
of
fruity
citrus
hops
mixed
with
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
a
mediumlight
fruity
body
mild
bitterness
caramel
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
all
told
this
amber
ale
is
ridiculously
tasty
and
has
everything
that
i
love
about
american
craft
breweries
this
is
what
an
amber
ale
should
taste
like
full
sail
did
a
real
good
job
im
not
a
fan
of
ambers
right
now
going
through
a
bitters
pale
ales
phase
this
ones
good
for
the
style
though
and
for
the
season
ho
ho
ho
good
brew
well
done
amber
ale
enjoyable
easily
drinkable
pours
a
very
appealing
and
crystal
clear
ruby
amber
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
head
and
good
retention
nose
is
a
bit
disapointing
after
the
great
eye
show
pale
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
dominate
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
earthy
hop
and
some
fruity
esters
with
such
low
hop
character
im
questioning
the
age
of
my
sample
right
now
taste
follows
with
a
nicely
balanced
malty
profile
backed
by
hop
and
fruity
esters
bigger
caramel
here
with
a
decent
bittering
and
touch
of
citrus
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
easy
drinker
overall
a
decent
beer
but
the
appearance
was
definitely
the
highlight
overall
this
brew
would
pair
great
with
almost
anything
it
is
a
sessionable
amber
that
is
great
for
a
cold
season

very
nice

bodied

goes

with

overall
a
very
good

an
okay
maltytasting
fairly
bland
amber
ale
a
solid
amber
from
full
sail
it
pours
a
dark
red
body
with
a
really
thick
foamy
head
strong
malt
presence
plays
with
some
hops
and
a
caramel
fruity
flavor
to
boot
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
beer
not
one
of
the
best
ambers
out
there
but
one
thats
worth
trying
o
this
is
just
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
flavor
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
its
a
moderately
rich
beer
with
a
nice
weight
but
id
gladly
throw
back
several
pints
of
this
it
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
two
finger
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quite
quickly
but
laces
quite
well
on
the
nose
theres
not
much
going
on
some
roast
malts
a
little
caramel
raisinsgrapes
biscuits
and
bread
though
all
very
weak
and
not
overly
appetizing
the
taste
follows
the
nose
though
the
malts
shine
through
its
quite
sweet
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
following
through
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
really
water
with
a
tiny
bit
of
carbonation
overall
its
a
really
drinkable
beer
quite
nice
for
the
heat
of
the
day
and
would
probably
go
well
with
some
bbq
but
other
than
that
not
much
going
for
it
not
worth
getting
a
whole
sixer
of
it
and
not
worth
much
effort
in
searching
out
a
solid
amber
nothing
too
exciting
but
drinkable
another
okay
beer
from
full
sail
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
but
its
still
pretty
good
easy
drinking
amber
that
is
all
about
malts
and
a
bit
of
spicy
playfulness
great
for
a
change
of
pace
but
a
bit
sweet
for
me
o
a
respectable
amber
could
do
with
less
carbonation
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
thin
layer
of
offwhite
head
no
distinct
smells
but
reminded
me
of
a
lager
yuengling
with
a
similar
look
taste
was
good
but
i
felt
it
lacked
a
star
flavor
meaning
that
it
was
just
plain
but
with
longlasting
aftertaste
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
down
the
road
but
for
now
its
soso
i
used
to
drink
this
a
decent
amount
when
i
was
back
in
portland
before
i
was
of
age
so
when
i
saw
it
at
the
union
sq
whole
foods
yesterday
i
had
to
grab
one
it
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
respectable
head
the
nose
has
some
sweet
toasted
malt
but
also
a
little
bit
of
corn
something
off
the
taste
was
close
to
what
i
remember
but
once
again
there
was
something
off
quality
wise
a
bit
of
sulfur
and
a
bit
too
much
diacetyl
it
also
wasnt
quite
as
full
as
i
wouldve
liked
overall
it
was
ok
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
is
full
sail
doing
something
differently
or
has
the
nostalgia
just
worn
off
o
taste
grows
on
me
as
i
work
my
way
down
the
bottle
but
overall
i
think
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
overall
a
solid
offering
mild
pleasant
refreshing
and
sessionable
along
with
session
one
of
two
full
sail
beers
youre
likely
to
find
in
my
fridge
hands
downs
this
is
an
american
amber
ale
that
will
always
look
forward
to
sipping
perfect
balanced
an
interesting
amber
perhaps
a
bit
lighter
in
taste
and
body
than
i
would
anticipate
yet
very
satisfying
overall
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
overall
drinkability
if
i
had
judged
this
book
by
its
cover
i
would
have
liked
it
a
lot
however
the
important
parts
dont
hold
water
the
moderate
head
crests
a
little
below
a
fingers
worth
of
eggshell
white
foam
dissipates
in
a
big
rush
down
to
a
thin
layer
across
the
surface
what
meager
lacing
there
is
sticks
adequately
the
liquid
is
more
brown
than
copper
likewise
more
red
than
orange
very
clear
and
transparent
extremely
few
bubbles
visible
the
nose
conveys
sweetness
via
caramel
milk
chocolate
pecans
and
yeast
comes
up
with
a
little
citrus
and
herbal
hops
but
remains
tame
overall
when
the
floral
notes
appear
they
support
the
sweeter
profile
difficult
to
name
any
particular
fruit
aspect
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
causing
it
to
feel
semiflat
on
the
palate
drier
here
with
grass
pine
white
pepper
and
sea
salt
nuances
at
the
same
time
theres
nuts
graham
cracker
caramel
and
chocolate
to
bring
it
back
to
the
middle
which
is
where
it
resides
pleasurable
but
playing
it
safe
fruitier
through
the
finish
with
apple
peach
and
apricot
notes
hard
to
really
fault
it
but
at
the
same
time
doesnt
get
you
too
excited
to
pop
open
another
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
slight
head
smell
is
of
the
caramel
malt
but
nothing
really
beyond
that
flavor
wise
is
pretty
strright
up
sweet
malts
maybe
a
touch
of
some
floral
hops
in
there
it
teeters
on
the
line
between
enjoyably
sweet
and
too
sweet
for
me
landing
on
the
right
side
of
it
when
all
is
said
and
done
a
medium
body
to
this
one
its
perfectly
decent
and
priced
right
but
certainly
not
the
most
memorable
amber
i
have
had
o
solid
sessionable
amber
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
great
either

session
brew
overall
i
really
disliked
this
beer
it
looks
smells
and
feels
like
a
solid
amber
ale
but
the
sweetness
just
kills
it
for
me
this
is
quite
average
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
subdued
and
mellow
and
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
do
nothing
to
change
the
experience
i
probably
wont
ever
seek
this
out
a
very
tasty
amber
ale
that
does
all
that
the
style
perscribes
but
more
malt
richness
and
less
onedimensional
sweetness
could
have
resulted
in
a
better
balanced
american
amber
ale
the
appearance
turned
out
nice
the
lacing
followed
me
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
was
a
little
patchy
but
overall
it
was
pretty
full
the
body
was
nice
and
the
head
wasnt
bad
ill
give
it
a
4
because
the
lacing
was
damn
good
and
everything
else
wasnt
too
bad
the
color
is
an
alluring
amber
hue
fantastic
bubbly
head
that
leaves
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
fruity
esters
and
floral
hop
notes
not
unlike
a
good
ipa
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
very
clean
with
a
hint
of
lemon
like
spring
water
giving
way
to
hop
flavors
and
a
malt
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
mouth
feel
leaving
me
wanting
more
very
refreshing
o
this
is
a
solid
american
amberred
ale
that
is
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
most
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
and
is
a
decent
representation
of
this
style
a
very
solid
amber
and
if
this
is
how
you
like
your
amber
it
might
be
among
the
best
i
like
a
bit
more
hops
and
less
density
in
the
malt
but
thats
a
personal
preference
overall
drinkability
the
acidicbitter
lime
peel
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
too
long
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
offer
very
strong
hop
characters
in
the
taste
overall
aside
from
the
slight
pucker
at
the
end
of
the
sip
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
little
on
the
heavier
maltier
and
darker
side
for
an
amber
but
remains
a
very
easy
drinker
i
would
drink
this
one
again
but
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
sweet
and
balanced

this

me
almost
a
standardwell
done
good
stuff
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
while
it
was
certainly
a
malty
beer
it
wasnt
over
the
top
and
it
was
extremely
drinkable
impressed
idk
why
but
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
pin
pointing
exact
flavors
that
this
beer
has
within
it
but
maybe
thats
because
its
more
of
a
simple
beer
which
i
really
appreciate
when
i
initially
tried
it
i
instantly
recognized
it
was
a
simple
amber
drinking
beer
just
done
extremely
well
and
nicely
balance
not
too
malty
like
others
ive
had
conclusion
this
is
what
you
might
call
a
session
beer
for
sure
however
just
one
is
nice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
good
amber
it
is
quite
different
than
other
leaders
in
this
style
like
new
belgium
but
i
think
it
may
actually
be
more
accurate
if
youre
expecting
something
spectacular
you
will
be
disappointed
but
if
youre
expecting
a
proper
amber
you
will
get
just
that
hey
and
i
dont
even
really
dig
this
style
this
was
great
freshly
opened
and
lost
some
edge

a
little
time
poured

is

clear
amber
almost
auburn
when
held
to

light
theres
a
nice
smell
of
caramel
and
malt
taste
is
fairly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
less
than
half
way
through
the
beer
though
it
seemed
to
lose
some
of
that
taste
and
smell
and
become
a
more
average
beer
overall
you
know
this
is
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
i
can
drink
this
one
all
night
i
also
had
this
one
ontap
at
a
hotel
and
i
drank
more
than
i
probably
should
have
it
sneaks
up
on
you
and
its
so
palatable
that
you
can
totally
drink
it
for
a
long
evening
i
dont
particularly
like
this
style
all
that
much
but
something
about
oregon
this
beer
and
a
mild
evening
in
downtown
salem
has
stuck
with
me
taste
and

a
very
nice

that
wiill
get

a
really
quite
solid
amber
ale
with
good
flavour
and
a
nice
hoppy

o
looks
and
smells
just
okay
the
taste
is
alright
has
the
right
amount
of

flavor
and
i
get
a
nice
toasted
finish
but
theres
not
enough
there
overall
overall
a
solid

ale
the
smell
is
lacking
and
the
taste
could
be
a
little
stronger
or
interesting
not
bad
but
not
great
o
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
i
felt
like
something
was
missing
to
really
draw
me
in
o
solid
amber
good
flavor
not
a
twist
off
regardless
of
what
the
bottle
cap
says
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
malts
citrus
hops
and
a
faint
nutty
note
taste
is
caramel
malts
leafy
citrus
hops
a
bit
of
toasted
grain
and
a
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
tasty
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
very
light
which
to
be
honest
kinda
dissapointed
me
what
i
could
pick
up
was
very
grainy
and
boring
with
big
notes
of
cereal
grain
very
apparent
as
well
as
a
musty
kinda
of
bread
smell
some
light
grassy
hops
were
present
way
in
the
back
but
to
be
honest
were
really
a
non
issue
as
this
was
dominate
by
a
musty
bread
like
malt
big
time
musky
bready
like
flavor
that
just
was
too
strong
to
really
get
anything
else
to
come
out
from
behind
it
there
was
a
slight
hoppiness
in
the
finish
but
again
i
stress
light
as
it
was
really
not
a
factor
in
the
overall
flavor
this
was
truly
a
malty
lager
and
really
not
the
normal
flavor
i
would
expect
from
the
style
but
thats
neither
here
not
there
overall
decent
amber
with
a
decent
hop
presence
odnot
a
big
fan
i
absolutely
love
amberred
ales
that
are
big
and
bold
this
is
the
opposite
just
bland
and
boring
nothing
else
to
say
so
far
my
favorite
beer
of
the
summer
the
beers
that
i
poured
from
the
bottles
were
lightly
carbonated
with
little
to
no
head
it
did
leave
sporadic
bits
of
lace
on
the
glass
while
being
drunk
the
taste
was
somewhat
disappointing
for
me
a
little
bit
harsh
for
an
amber
i
thought
the
bitterness
was
a
little
strong
and
quite
unexpected
it
did
have
a
nice
mouth
feel
to
it
this
beer
would
probably
go
well
with
grilled
red
meats
or
bbq
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
beer
but
thought
it
was
ok
o
a
nice
deviation
from
the
ambers
of
the
northeast
certianly
worth
a
try
everything
an
amber
should
be
with
a
west
coast
spin
with
the
hop
choice
im
in
love
overall
a
tasty
well
balanced
ale
o
middle
of
the
river
amber
red
to
me
it
has
some
flavor
but
is
not
as
assertive
as
i
like
all
told
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
was
not
blown
away
o
a
good
beer
to
have
if
your
at
a
bbq
or
something
a
good
session
beer
but
far
from
a
top
tier
amber
o
like
a
lot
of
full
sail
beers
ive
had
this
was
a
let
down
light
body
watery
and
refreshing
lightly
browned
malt
is
the
main
flavor
crisp
with
sharp
tones
overwhelm
the
initial
bit
of
sweetness
enough
hops
to
balance
the
warmth
of
caramel
and
bready
flavors
slight
bitterness
holds
up
the
aftertaste
with
a
dirty
perfectly
drinkable
example
of
this
catchall
style
overall
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
recommended
d
very
accessible
to
drink
especially
in
numbers
a
bit
sweet
at
times
but
34
will
go
down
without
much
thought
good
casual
pub
style
amber
this
is
one
bangin
beer
i
had
high
expectations
going
in
and
the
beer
impressed
me
even
further
poured
nice
and
amber
with
big
thick
tan
head
thick
lace
drags
down
the
glass
big
malt
smell
with
light
fruity
aromas
mingled
in
the
taste
is
great
biscuity
light
leaf
and
citrus
hopping
again
big
malt
occurring
in
the
taste
with
some
definite
caramel
malts
to
chew
on
the
body
of
the
beer
is
where
i
become
further
impressed
its
so
thick
so
smooth
so
creamy
its
almost
as
if
its
on
nitro
but
its
not
feels
like
a
big
boozer
as
well
but
its
only
5

excellent
amber
pours
a
clear
dark
ambercopper
color
with
a
nice
2
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
on
the
top
of
the
beer
nice
puffy
rings
of
lace
settle
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
toasty
malts
and
citrus
zest
hops
a
fairly
standard
amber
beer
smell
taste
is
a
bit
better
with
bready
malt
and
citrus
zest
flavors
very
mild
hop
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
and
is
somewhat
clean
and
smooth
overall
an
above
average
amber
beer
but
nothing
too
special
this
is
my
first
beer
rating
so
i
will
fumble
through
it
i
try
to
try
a
new
beer
every
week
and
the
week
i
choose
full
sail
amber
i
was
truley
impressed
it
poured
a
beautiful
red
amber
color
and
had
a
nice
fruity
smell
and
he
best
the
flavor
was
super
it
was
t
i
liked
it
as
a
style
i
often
find
amber
ales
to
be
a
little
boring
full
sail
has
corrected
my
misconception
not
with
a
big
hop
infusion
or
high
abv
but
by
craftily
blending
flavors
together
in
a
way
that
shows
the
brewers
true
talents
this
sixer
wont
last
long
overall
very
solid
beer
its
mild
hop
bitterness
and
balance
makes
it
a
highly
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
good
sessionable
amber
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
quite
sessionable
good
balance
this
is
one
of
full
sails
more
palatable
and
drinkable
brews
overall
solid
beer
overall
its
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
is
intended
it
is
a
wellbalanced
amber
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
this
one
again
drink
while
the
beer
wont
knock
your
socks
off
it
has
a
pleasant
taste
and
would
be
highly
sessionable
im
happy
i
tried
it
and
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
fresh
on
tap
clear
deep
amber
with
a
thin
cap
of
fine
beige
bubbles
looks
nice
mild
malty
aroma
brown
sugar
light
roasted
and
toasted
malts
low
bitterness
malty
up
front
with
some
citrus
and
hop
spice
toasted
malts
medium
bodied
with
creamy
carbonation
dry
in
texture
quite
tasty
and
easy
drinking
nicely
balanced
t
some
pretty
strong
caramel
malts
with
a
gentle
floral
hop
finish
some
caramel
and
citrus
thrown
in
but
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
feel
like
there
should
be
pretty
unremarkable
the
beer
was
a
dark
brownish
red
color
the
head
was
thick
bubbly
offwhite
and
faded
quickly
it
smells
mostly
of
nutty
toasted
malts
i
could
also
smell
an
earthy
hop
presence
the
taste
first
has
a
slight
lemon
bite
followed
by
some
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
there
is
a
bready
undertones
and
a
slight
pine
bitterness
the
beer
is
lightmedium
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
great
amber
i
dont
drink
very
many
ambers
but
this
one
had
a
nice
bitter
finish
right
up
my
alley
drinkability
your
standard
amber
ale
easily
replaceable
easily
forgettable
while
theres
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
theres
nothing
to
make
me
ever
want
to
have
it
again
its
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
other
100
amber
ales
out
there
you
could
certainly
do
worse
but
you
could
easily
do
much
much
better
verdict
perfect
for
any
time
of
the
year
this
beer
wont
wow
any
seasoned
beer
lovers
but
newbies
might
just
find
this
to
be
a
standard
in
their
fridge
overall
i
had
a
single
and
was
glad
i
just
had
one
dry
and
mild
bitterness
this
one
trick
pony
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
not
horrible
by
any
means
but
just
not
my
thing
drinkability
is
real
easy
on
this
one
not
exactly
bold
but
a
real
easy
drink
beer
with
good
qualities
to
detect
d
full
sail
amber
is
absolutely
delicious
sweet
and
toasty
flavors
make
it
very
drinkable
wow
this
was
good
on
tap
i
am
going
to
have
to
grab
a
sixer
drinkability
excellent
i
could
drink
these
all
day
pairs
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
and
holds
up
on
its
own
good
job
full
sail
full
sail
amber
comes
out
amber
like
with
a
golden
brown
look
and
just
enough
bubbles
to
sustain
a
cap
for
a
few
minutes
a
dark
tan
color
on
those
bubbles
no
stick
though
smell
is
str8
forward
caramel
and
some
small
chocolate
crystal
malt
is
noted
while
a
small
hopping
comes
through
thats
all
i
look
for
really
in
a
amber
cant
stand
str8
caramel
personally
taste
is
basically
the
same
im
impressed
this
is
not
so
sweet
and
the
hops
hold
their
own
in
this
fairly
fresh
bottle
feel
is
less
than
medium
but
coating
with
some
light
carb
running
through
its
vains
by
no
means
bitey
in
any
way
i
drank
it
i
enjoyed
it
lets
leave
it
at
that
d
very
easy
to
drink
taste
is
similarly
fruity
with
orange
syrup
and
maraschino
cherry
taking
the
lead
again
more
toasted
bread
would
be
appreciated
despite
all
the
fruity
esters
mouthfeel
isnt
as
juicy
some
amber
ales
which
is
a
good
thin
imo
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
off
tan
head
small
carbanation
could
hardly
see
the
bubble
the
west
coast
hops
hit
the
nose
but
blend
nice
with
the
whole
beer
for
full
sail
to
have
their
entrylevel
amber
at
these
heights
much
praise
cheers
full
sail
seems
to
put
together
some
nice
beers
drinkability
a
slightly
hoppy
average
amber
ale
i
like
the
greenhouse
aromas
but
this
is
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
a
decent
nonoffensive
beer
neither
highly
exciting
or
exceptional
but
a
solid
every
day
amber
worth
a
try
reviewed
on

thanks
to
sparky27
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
aroma
of
light
caramel
malts
and
sweet
fruit
flavor
of
caramel
toasted
and
biscuity
malts
with
a
sweet
fruity
finish
very
tasty
amber
and
quite
drinkable
as
ambers
go
this
one
hits
all
the
marks
a
slightly
pungent
citrus
aroma
prickly
fizzy
body
that
cuts
through
anything
spicy
or
sweet
decent
malty
base
with
sharp
hops
that
provide
a
nice
dry
finish
its
like
so
many
other
amber
ales
though
its
very
drinkable
but
theres
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
its
nothing
terribly
special
nor
is
it
terribly
terrible
you
can
do
worse
db
an
easy
going
balanced
amber
ale
with
appropriate
flavors
both
malt
and
hops
lend
nice
notes
to
this
easy
drinking
ale
d
this
beer
is
a
good
value
for
the
quality
of
beer
you
get
for
the
price
of
a
6
pack
as
sold
at
the
navy
exchange
package
store
i
continue
to
go
back
for
more
d
extremely
drinkable
here
wouldnt
or
couldnt
tell
it
was
5
5
until
i
scanned
the
bottle
also
the
balance
that
this
beer
shows
is
what
makes
it
one
of
that
best
amber
ales
ive
ever
came
across
smooth
finish
leaves
a
slight
dry
tealike
aftertaste
that
lingers
very
well
overall
a
decent
but
not
special
example
of
the
style
a
traditional
amber
with
no
notable
flaws
good
caramel
baseagain
this
is
not
sweet
the
finish
is
hoppy
bitterness
but
it
doesnt
last
that
long
again
this
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
the
body
is
on
the
richer
side
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
nicer
ambers
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
beer
genre
but
it
is
a
good
amber
beer
representative
thanks
full
sail
final
notes
would
make
a
good
beer
to
step
up
into
the
world
of
better
beers
and
honestly
makes
a
great
cooking
beer
nothing
special
though
d
very
good
amber
ale
that
i
would
love
to
have
in
the
future
seems
to
be
a
bit
sweet
but
with
a
decent
amount
of
hop
taste
i
find
it
to
be
nicely
balanced
at
5
5
abv
i
could
see
it
being
a
decent
session
beer
a
few
bottles
would
be
ok
for
me
d
amber
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
full
sail
keeps
it
interesting
drinkability
ok
i
guess
its
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
at
5
99
a
sixer
i
factor
price
into
all
of
my
rankings
this
is
good
value
i
would
drink
this
again
at
this
price
for
sure
drinkability
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
is
both
easy
to
drink
and
packed
with
flavour
the
hops
offer
a
little
extra
complexity
but
essentially
this
is
a
malty
beer
nice
ddecent
but
there
are
other
ambers
i
would
drink
before
this
one
the
finish
on
this
beer
is
stellar
the
grainy
hops
and
roasted
maltiness
synergize
well
together
aftertaste
is
a
roasted
caramel
flavor
a
great
beer
for
any
season
d
an
alright
amber
grows
on
you
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
d
good
amber
very
drinkable
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
but
for
a
cheap
sixer
it
works
d
an
easily
sessionable
beer
and
one
that
delivers
on
flavor
despite
its
simplicity
a
nice
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
amber
ale
simple
but
good
stuff
i
could
see
sessioning
these
i
only
had
one
12
oz
bottle
on
hand
but
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
enjoyed
this
beer
while
nothing
extraordinary
a
reliable
and
quite
solid
brew
good
version
of
the
style
dark
copper
hue
no
head
and
little
to
no
visible
signs
of
carbonation
excellent
malt
aroma
with
a
wee
bit
of
hop
scents
cutting
through
mellow
body
mellow
malt
bite
after
a
few
sips
i
can
really
taste
the
malts
cutting
through
theres
a
little
spice
in
there
just
a
little
i
almost
want
to
say
theres
some
burnt
malt
flavors
running
around
too
theres
some
hop
presence
in
there
but
they
arent
doing
much
of
the
talking
about
half
way
through
my
12oz
pour
i
start
to
notice
some
sugary
textures
lingering
in
my
mouth
but
not
over
powering
perfectly
crisp
always
refreshing
take
that
boont
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
heavy
meals
as
ive
made
this
my
bbq
beer
of
choice
in
the
past
d
easily
drinkable
well
done
in
what
can
be
a
pretty
average
category
d
low
abv
great
taste
great
session
beer
d
good
drinkability
wellrounded
beer
that
prepares
you
for
the
next
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
the
american
lager
with
an
added
spiciness
to
it
that
keeps
the
palate
refreshed
and
ready
for
the
next
sip
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
with
more
flavoring
than
the
standard
macrobrew
i
guess
the
overall
grade
is
basically
that
its
o
k
and
for
about
76er
its
not
a
bad
deal
overall
good
but
not
my
favorite
however
i
did
enjoy
drinking
it
in
short
it
was
subltly
good
think
i
got
some
bad
luck
here
poured
with
almost
no
head
at
first
a
few
soap
bubbles
then
a
very
thin
read
rose
color
is
a
hazy
dark
amber
aroma
is
malty
fruity
hops
flavor
metalic
malt
hop
bittersweet
can
tell
that
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
if
whatever
happened
to
it
hadnt
body
is
ok
but
flat
finish
is
at
first
sweet
then
bitter
in
not
such
a
good
way
dang
was
looking
forward
to
this
from
the
everything
shop
on
canal
near
the
quarter
the
hops
give
this
amber
a
bit
of
an
edge
for
me
making
it
an
easy
amber
to
have
a
few
of
its
refreshing
but
not
watery
and
a
subtle
and
quick
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
means
i
dont
have
to
wait
too
long
to
have
another
sip
you
can
score
these
dirt
cheap
in
reno
10
99
a
12
pack
at
bens
so
thats
big
time
in
the
drinkability
factor
its
actually
quite
good
i
think
there
are
no
harsh
aftertastes
or
anything
really
that
would
turn
me
away
from
this
beer
except
it
may
be
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
poured
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
appearance
with
slight
carbonation
and
no
head
retention
aroma
of
toasty
sweet
malt
with
caramel
some
hop
bitterness
with
sweet
caramel
malts
that
linger
on
the
palate
could
drink
no
more
than
2
or
3
in
one
sitting
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
enjoyable
amber
ale
wont
replace
my
got
to
amber
but
tasty
d
this
amazing
aroma
is
wonderful
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
follow
through
with
the
same
richness
and
depth
it
still
has
a
good
flavor
but
fizzy
finish
takes
a
lot
of
the
flavors
away
d
as
ambers
go
this
is
a
drinkable
example
d
a
solid
version
of
this
northwest
pub
style
for
around
6
50
a
sixer
certainly
a
value
theres
a
lot
of
9
ambers
where
youre
not
going
to
get
any
better
a
pretty
understated
and
yet
intensely
easy
to
drink
beer
this
is
nice
and
cheap
and
with
an
abv
of
5
5
it
makes
a
sixer
disappear
with
ease
drinkability
just
not
my
favorite
style
and
not
my
favorite
example
of
it
either
too
little
on
the
hops
for
me
i
will
probably
get
this
again
some
other
time
d
a
pleasant
surprise
as
ive
found
full
sails
beers
to
be
a
bit
hit
or
miss
this
is
a
definite
hit
especially
if
you
like
ales
with
a
sweet
english
herbal
hops
spin
drinkability
its
got
a
good
drinkability
for
a
warm
day
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
buts
not
bad
d
me
and
a
friend
managed
to
pack
away
a
6er
of
these
without
too
much
trouble
so
theyre
easy
to
drink
and
keep
on
without
meaning
to
buy
again
yes
but
not
as
an
amber
ale
drinkability
i
wavered
a
bit
on
the
drinkability
score
but
in
this
case
i
think
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
while
full
sail
amber
doesnt
blow
me
away

delicious
beer
the
first
beer
i
have
had
in
a
while
that
has
had
great
caramel
flavor
purs
dark
with
a
nice
amber
color
thick
cream
head
that
lingers
strong
malt
hops
hit
your
nose
right
away
it
can
taste
thin
in
the
mouth
but
still
has
a
overall
crisp
feeling
to
it
so
the
drinkability
is
good
as
it
does
have
character
i
gave
it
a
2
5
for
d
because
i
have
not
found
a
food
that
this
beer
goes
good
with
very
clean
and
almost
a
mineral
like
quality
found
in
here
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
that
i
can
see
myself
sessioning
nothing
special
this
beat
out
3

at

in

but
that
was
about
it

i
could
drink
all

would
definately
keep
me
from

this

is

i
would
call
it

it

i
expected

i
enjoyed
it

i
got
use

it
i
will
try
this
again

not

but
this
makes
me
wonder
whats
the
point
mediocre
at
best
very
smooth
and
flavorful
with
a
significant
malt
presence
providing
a
richer
and
more
complex

profile
than
some
of
the
other
american
ambers
ive
tried
it
does
get
a
wee
bit
dry
and
bitter
in
the
finish
but
its
subtle
enough
merely
to
contribute
a
little
bite
to
its
otherwise
soft
and
wellrounded
character
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
medium

an

a

sweet
caramel

bitterness
on
the

that

brew
seems
a
bit
heavy
for
an
amber
style
ale
but
has
lot
of
flavor
and
good
sweet

character
a
good
brew
o
i
dont
know
if
traveling
in
my
wifes
suitcase
from
la
to
mississippi
messed
up
the
taste
but
i
was
expecting
more
once
again
the
cranberries
cut
in
on
the
taste
malty
but
yet
smooth
the
hop
level
is
under
a
pale
ale
and
balanced
with
hints
of
chocolate
nice
amber
red
color
and
foam
level
in
the
pour
think
a
better
flat
tire
my
personal
alltime
favorite
beer
o
would
definitely
recommend
because
of
its
unique
combination
of
hops
and
malts
i
am
definitely
going
to
be
trying
other
speakeasy
beers
o
decent

rather

to
try

is
the
type
of
smaller

i
have
not

in

quite

despite
being
almost
7
months

will
definitely
look
for
this

certainly
doing
their
thing
and
doing
it
well
far
be
it
from
me
an
avowed
hophead
to
complain
but
ok
im
also
a
fan
of
balance
and
the
way
the
malt
showed
up
here
shook
its
frilly
bits

bobs

leans

a
bright

successful
that
afternoonand
after
taking
it
to
a
poker
night
i
found
a
similarly
positive
reaction
strong
demanding
pale
ale
that
gently
shakes
the
teeth
and
smooth
out
the
throat
the
caramel
especially
sweetens
the
end
overall
enjoyed
this
amber
ale
loved
the
caramel
burnt
woodsy
feel
of
this
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
amber
ale
one
of
the
best
poured
a
reddishbrown
body
with
decent
head
and
lace
a
minimal
amount
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
balances
with
a
large
dose
of
citric
hops
in
the
aroma
and
this
repeats
itself
in
the
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
smooth
the
beer
is
rather
simple
and
there
isnt
too
much
going
on
but
what
is
happening
is
good
wellbalanced
sweet
and
bready
malts
with
citric
hops
give
the
beer
a
hoppy
and
yet
also
malty
taste
and
it
finishes
a
little
dry
and
bitter
from
malts
and
hops
overall
not
good
at
all
really
disappointed
in
this
one
because
i
have
respect
for
speakeasy
and
generally
love
their
beers
too
bad
pretty
good
amber
red
or
brown
ale
you
pick
o
really
good
hoppy
amber
ale
great
bold
taste
with
plenty
of
bitterness
balanced
with
a
hefty
malt
backbone
this
arrived
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
nose
was
slightly
caramelish
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
malty
caramel
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
mild
not
sweet
at
all
american
amberred
ale
this
was
much
more
like
a
classic
english
pale
ale
imho
well
done
and
totally
unexpected
overall
quality

amercan

im
a
fan
of
speak
easy
and
find
them
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
in
their
approach
to
hopping
than
other
west

breweries
i
will
get
this

again

nothing
overly

about

toasted

with
some
pinycitrusy

taste
consistent
with

there
is
also
a
distinct
metallic
flavor
mouthfeel

in

with
an
even

and
a
trace
of

overall
a
pretty
lackluster
amber
not
sure
if
its
just
an
off
bottle
past
its
prime
or
just
subpar
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
again
any
time
soon
im
still
a
novice
craft
beer
drinker
but
ive
noticed
the
ones
that
are
particularly
dark
in
this
case
red
are
definitely
my
preference
its
definitely
got
the
hops
what
do
you
expect
from
these
guys
and
im
definitely
looking
for
this
at
bevmo
overall
excellent
pours
a
ruby
red
hue
with
a
one
finger
bubbly
head
and
some
nice
subtle
lacing
and
definitely
a
red
ale
on
eyethe
smell
is
a
heap
of
resinous
piney
hops
mixed
with
strawberries
and
a
slight
herbalness
its
a
hopped
red
thats
for
surefeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
really
sets
the
sessionability
on
the
high
end
and
with
that
massive
hopfest
first
encountered
on
smell
its
nicely
balanced
with
sweet
sticky
toffee
mid
palette
and
on
the
finish
the
hops
are
still
there
but
its
only
a
light
herbal
bitterness
and
overall
its
one
of
those
beers
that
u
have
to
try
but
im
not
rushing
out
to
grab
again
as
i
still
prefer
riversides
44
but
also
could
happily
drink
if
offered
cheers
d
totally
a
must
try
original
theres
a
thick
piney
grapefruit
hop
aroma
with
a
nice
rounded
hop
note
the
flavor
is
hoppy
and
dank
with
some
chewy
pine
its
a
hop
bomb
for
sure
forgot
how
good
this
one
is
poured
a
clear
red
with
a
halffinger
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
ring
of
white
leaving
no
lacing
a
good
looking
red
ale
but
nothing
amazing
scents
of
lemon
juice
lemon
zest
sweet
citrus
and
orange
a
very
citrus
forward
aroma
dominated
a
bit
more
by
the
sweeter
aromas
than
the
lemon
very
good
though
flavor
is
extremely
hop
forward
though
the
actual
bitterness
level
of
the
hops
is
low
the
hop
profile
is
floral
citrus
pith
grapefruit
pith
and
pine
resin
balanced

good
for
a
nice
hop
forward

with
hints
of

i
liked
it
mouthfeel

mouthfeel
despite
the

overall
this
is
a

amber
ale
its
got
a
nice
citrusy
aroma
and
a
good
hop
profile
with
just
enough
malt
to
keep
it
from
being
too
bitter
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
would
drink
it
again
poured
rather
aggressively
from
a
bottle
into
a
16
oz
champaign
flute
it
develops
1
head
that
settles
down
to

after
a

color

deep
golden
honey
aroma
is

fruity
and
hops
flavor
is
a
bit
disappointinghops
pine
a
little
caramel
where
did
the
fruit
go
the
flavor
got
better
and
better
with
each

mouth
feel

overall
this
is
very
good
maybe
outstanding
i
agree
with
micromaniac129
below
a
really
really
good
beer
nice
relatively
hoppy
amber
the
pour
is
deep
brick
red
clear
though
with
an
inch
of
khaki
head
foamy
and
lasting
it
smells
like
dryer
but
still
semi
sweet
red
malts
ale
yeast
and
a
good
dose
of
american
west
coast
hops
the
taste
matches
yeasty
for
a
red
and
the
best
of
both
red
worlds
here
dry
and
clean
also
sweet
and
rich
its
a
contrast
but
a
good
one
carbonated
well
and
very
easy
drinking
i
would
have
guessed
4

abv
this
is
easy
going
medium
body
and
a
hint
of
smoke
i
dont
know
what
is
prohibition
about
this
it
makes
me
want
another
good
not
great
but
arent
most
of
them
my
first
brew
from
speakeasy
is
good
enough
to
make
me
want
another
so
good
on
them
on
tap
at
renegade
publik
house
poured
into
a
dogfish

pint
glass
pours
a
medium
to
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malt
and
the
citrus
and
floral
influence
of
centennial
and
cascade
hops
flavor
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
neutral
malt
and
light
citrus
rind
finishes
with
citrus
bitterness
nice
medium
creamy
body
a
nicely
made
red
ale
that
seemed
a
hair
balanced
towards
the
hops
than
malt
but
the
creamy
body
made
up
for
it
lingering
citrus
hop
bitterness
enjoyable
but
somehow
i
think
prohibition
ales
werent
quite
this
tasty
as
mentioned
above
this
had
the
look
aroma
and
taste
more
of
a
scottish
ale
than
an
amber
ale
and
unfortunately
not
that
good
a
one
wouldnt
reccomend
this
offering
though
the
label
is
pretty
good
looking
nicely
balanced
and
easy
drinking
tasty
stuff
think
i
might
have
gotten
an
off
bottle
poured
this
a
bit
cold
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
that
lasts
and
plenty
of
lace
color
is
a
very
hazy
to
cloudy
amber
aroma
isnt
too
strong
but
is
vinous
flavor
is
malt
sharp
hop
metallic
yeast
biscuit
hint
tart
body
is
decent
but
has
some
high
points
from
the
odd
flavors
carbonation
is
good
finish
is
like
flavor
and
has
those
less
than
pleasing
characteristics
that
last
too
long
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
snifter
upon
opening
bottle
gushes
out
as
i
quickly
get
it
into
a
glass
the
appearance
is
a
deep
clear
read
with
tan
head
that
retains
nicely
and
heavy
lacing
nose
starts
with
heavy
cereal
grain
malt
backed
up
by
toast
caramel
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
moderately
malty
up
front
with
a
nice
herbal
hoppiness
that
comes
through
and
takes
some
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
decent
balance
of
flavors
here
with
an
emphasis
on
the
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
brew
features
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
but
is
overall
somewhat
forgettable
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
the
toasty
malts
threw
me
for
a
loop
not
the
most
hopped
up
amber
but
a
little
more
ambery
than
a
hopped
up
amber
not
bad
o
fairly
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
so
that
neither
really
dominates
the
palate
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
not
quite
as
good
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
was
still
decent
though
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
i
couldnt
recommend
it
the
bottle
is
claimed
to
be
a
hoppy
ale
it
wasnt
hoppy
at
all
and
quite
watery
tasted
better
from
the
bottle
than
in
a
glass
but
yet
i
wasnt
impressed
after
a
short
message
from
speakeasy
on
instagram
im
considering
trying
a
second
bottle
when
i
see
it
again
maybe
then
i
can
redo
my
review
and
rate
it
higher
overall
a
solid
brew
but
needs
more
body
and
complexity
just
comes
off
too
light
leaves
the
palette
begging
for
more
pours
reddish
amber
with
scant
remaining
white
foam
some
clings
around
the
ring
of
the
glass
bready
nose
slightly
nutty
some
vanilla
taste
opens
slightly
sweet
with
a
tangy
pine
hop
bittering
is
aggressive
as
advertised
good
underlying
flavor
but
perhaps
too
aggressive
back
down
it
does
improve
once
it
warms
up
at
least
amber
ales
are
a
highly
varied
style
but
prohibition
ale
seems
to
have
nailed
the
qualities
i
expect
in
an
amber
ale
as
well
or
better
than
most
i
have
sampled
the
beer
has
a
good
deal
of
complexity
and
yet
it
still
manages
to
maintain
a
smoothness
that
goes
down
easy
a
very
nice
appearance
and
other
factors
combine
to
make
this
an
amber
that
i
highly
recommend
enjoyable
this
was
strong
enough
to
be
an
american
amberred
ale
even
though
it
looked
and
felt
darker
than
others
that
ive
had
before
most
of
those
were
too
hoppy
but
this
had
balance
like
a
good
esb
even
though
the
packaging
was
a
bit
over
the
top
like

a

ale
easy
to

like
no

ale
ive
had
it
reminded
me
of
a

a

of

that
isnt
heavy

would
be

to

sticks

in

with

caramel
an
aggressive

profile
shows
itself
in

and
thats
nice
but
it
doesnt
have
the
nice
complex

base
that
the

i
just
drank
had
the

is
there
but
just
not
alot

a

beer
no

and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
by

there
are

theres
a

red
ale
deserves
its
status
as
a
classic
rich
maltiness
of
toffee
caramel
and
raisin
some
fruity
hop
and
a
mild
bitterness
be
really
interested
to
try
this
a
little
fresher
was
initially
mildly
disappointed
in
the
beer
but
i
appreciated
it
a
bit
more
as
i
analyzed
it
as
usual
this
analysis
allowed
the
beer
to
warm
a
bit
which
brought
out
the
flavors
a
bit
more
definitely
a
retry
could
see
1
half
a
tick
to
a
tick
higher
good
the
initial
flavor
is
bitter
and
by
the
3rd
or
4th
sip
you
grow
accustomed
to
it
as
red
ales
go
its
solid
but
its
not
my
favorite
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
left
a
half
inch
creme
colored
head
smells
very
sweet
but
still
has
a
bitter
aroma
to
it
it
is
a
very
distinct
taste
to
it
very
malty
notes
upfront
revealing
a
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
flavor
that
is
quickly
followed
with
a
dash
of
hops
and
a
slight
alcohol
taste
and
sensation
absolutely
fantastic
beer
real
hearty
and
tasty
sam
a
really
great
heavily
hopped
beer
that
manages
to
borrow
some
great
stuff
from
a
few
different
styles
pretty
sure
this
should
be
considered
a
classic
overwhelmed
by
the
bitter
bitter
was
to
much
took
away
from
the
tasty
the
malt
flavor
of
this
beer
is
awesome
lip
smacking
good
and
tasty
but
it
gets
overwhelmed
by
the
bitter
what
would
have
been
an
extremely
high
beer
fell
down
under
4
because
the
bitter
was
to
much
took
away
from
the
tasty
if
you
are
a
hop
head
this
one
should
be
right
in
your
wheel
house
overall
whats
not
to
love
great
look
great
taste
i
would
highly
recommend
this
delicious
and
fullbodied
red
ale
strongly
flavorful
with
evident
malt
influence
but
distinctive
and
obvious
hop
presence
finishes
evenly
with
slight
lingering
bitterness
a
big
chewy
beer
supported
by
medium
low
carbonation
overall
good
like
a
strong
ipa
but
a
bit
sweeter
i
prefer

o

i
really

this
and

have
no

recommending
it
4s
across
the
board
o
very
nice
beer
very
complex
and
very

leans
a
slight
bit
to
the
bitter
side
but
barely
multiple
layers
of
flavor
play
across
the
palate
as
you
drink
this
beer
i
like
the
subtle
drying
finish
this
is
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
likes
hop
flavor
but
not
the
bitter
bite
of
an
ipa
it
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
without
a
doubt
o
given
the
bottle
description
and
name
i
was
expecting
a
little
milder
maltier
brew
that
being
said
im
not
a
bit
disappointed
this
is
right
in

thats

this

o
one
of
my

red

and
probably
my
favorite
bear
republic
beer
to
be
completely
honest
i
have
not
had
apex
taste
was
just
like
the
smell
juicy
and
piney
hops
with
a
powerful
malt
backbone
was
simply
delicious
and
very
drinkable
had
another
one
it
was
so
good
and
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
back
a
moderately
hopped
up
and
smoke
red
ale
im
sure
the
freshness
is
hindering
my
opinion
111613
seven
months
past
bottling
but
its
just
okay
the
rest
i
echo
some
of
the
other
reviews
nothing
in
my
review
would
indicate
that
this
is
a
special
beer
but
damn
it
was
good
sweetish
taste
with
some
sour
notes
here
and
there
no
hop
note
of
course
kind
of
feels
like
a
not
so
strong
arrogant
bastard
not
unplesant
tasting
at
all
ive
had
it
in
the
past
and
enjoyed
but
emmory
does
not
serve
me
well
in
this
beers
case
o
some
may
say
this
is
more
of
a
red
ipa
than
an
amberred
but
to
me
this
is
what
i
want
a
red
ale
to
taste
like
so
much
tastier
and
more
interesting
than
most
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
o
not
blown
away
but
it
is
solid
would
recommend
for
amber
lovers
i
wanted
to
expand
my
experience
to
red
ales
so
i
checked
ba
and
this
one
had
a
good
rating
so
i
bought
it
this
is
a
great
full
bodied
ale
that
could
easily
become
a
favorite
it
has
just
enough
hoppyness
and
not
to
much
the
finish
is
very
smooth
the
enjoyment
is
increased
if
you
get
your
nose
in
it
as
you
drink
what
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
that
have
never
heard
of
it
o
good
beer
solid
effort
but
smell
hides
it
true
colors
of
essentially
an
ipa
or
apa
scottish
style
is
a
little
of
a
stretch
so
it
is
good
but
not
actually
the
style
listed
if
that
is
a
fault
of
course
on
the
label
it
says
it
breaks
all
style
molds
agree
so
to
be
a
red
ipa
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
22114
its
a
lucky
almostoriental
red
that
meets
your
eye
only
a
little
lacy
smooth
smells
like
teen
spirit
i
think
tasty
herbaceous
nearly
grassy
yet
not
that
and
good
for
the
balance
maintained
on
that
line
bitterness
of
hops
with
a
sweet
finish
bright
brilliant
like
an
herb
thats
good
for
you
and
is
also
yummy
this
is
my
favorite
i
can
live
with
this
one
even
if
it
has
to
be
living
in
sin
i
know
you
understand
excellent
beer
tasty
and
bold
definitely
not
shy
on
hops
malty
and
spiced
it
felt
to
me
as
a
mix
of
and
american
red
ale
and
a
scottish
ale
especially
as
it
warms
up
with
a
climbing
complexity
another
great
offering
from
br
o
id
recommend
giving
this
a
try
though
i
wouldnt
say
its
one
of
their
better
beers
its
not
super
interesting
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
gives
way
to
a
very
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
roasty
malty
there
are
some
notes
of
hops
but
mostly
sweet
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
deep
n
balanced
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
there
is
alot
of
malt
but
it
is
offset
by
some
very
nice
hops
this
is
quite
a
smooth
beer
maybe
even
sessionable
i
admire
bear
republic
for
never
resting
on
their
laurels
and
for
consistently
creating
new
and
exciting
offerings
but
i
was
really
blown
away
by
this
commonly
available
almost
session
ale
red
rocket
is
a
super
drinkable
and
fantastically
well
crafted
west
coast
version
of
an
american
amber
ale
but
done
with
a
scotch
ale
twist
impressive
to
say
the
least
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
hoppy
and
sweet
amber
colored
with
a
small
head
strangely
large
bubbles
as
well
smell
is
strong
with
caramel
maltiness
with
hops
and
maybe
some
grapefruit
medium
to
heavy
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
taste
is
more
hoppy
up
front
than
i
expected
but
the
caramel
malt
rushes
in
soon
thereafter
while
the
aftertaste
is
equally
sour
malt
and
bitter
hops
balanced
but
intense
it
was
ok
but
there
are
a
lot
better
and
more
sessionable
options
out
there
when
it
comes
to
ambers
including
the
less
intense
and
ultra
easy
to
find
fat
tire
amber
overall
this
is
a
very
good
bold
ale
the
spicy
smooth
flavor
up
front
is
accented
with
perfect
hoppiness
would
like
to
seek
out
again

to
be

oz

o
the
sweetbitter
balance
is
pleasing
they
call
this
a
bastardized
scottish
style
red
ale
packed
with
distinctive
flavors
and
an
aggressive
hop
character
drinking
some
bears
that
out
the
appearance
was
a
dark
amber
just
a
hint
too
strong
when
compared
to
amber
maple
syrup
but
still
really
good
it
has
a
pleasant
fate
smell
of
something
fruity
the
taste
was
not
bitter
much
and
only
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
it
only
went
down
smooth
and
felt
fruity
and
roasted
nuts
it
has
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
did
not
turn
to
foamy
with
swishing
however
the
roasted
flavor
becomes
more
prominent

i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
the
best
red
ipa
that
ive
had
compared
to
green
flash
hop
head
red
and
oskar
blues
gknight
theres
a
spiciness
thats
just
not
there
with
the
others
its
almost
like
if
someone
mixed
one
of
these
two
beers
and
pliny
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
good
this
was
especially
at
4
50
a
bomber
appearance
is
a
reddishbrown
more
brown
than
red
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
that
left
thick
lace
rings
in
its
wake
malt
notes
are
present
in
the
nose
but
the
hoppiness
is
the
standout
feature
here
a
spicy
malt
note
that
is
almost
ryelike
takes
center
stage
in
the
flavor
profile
the
hops
especially
on
the
finish
are
quite
pronounced
for
a
basic
red
this
is
an
impressive
offering
from
a
really
solid
brewery
o
an
excellent
ale
ive
had
it
bottled
as
well
and
while
that
is
very
good
this
beer
shines
on
tap
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
pours
a
reddish
chestnut
colour
the
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
for
a
bear
republic
brew
which
typically
feature
a
lot
of
aromatic
hops
there
are
aromas
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
bright
pinecitrus
its
an
easydrinker
for
nearly
7
abv
and
there
are
sweet
notes
of
fruit
loops
and
caramel
with
a
very
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
and
nicely
balanced
overall
imagine
a
malty
red
ale
and
a
california
hop
bomb
stuffed
into
the
same
bottle
this
beer
is
similar
to
mendocino
brewings
red
tale
ale
which
also
tries
to
pass
itself
off
as
just
an
amber
ale
not
bad
but
also
not
was
i
was
hoping
for
o
smooth
and
enjoyable
while
being
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
well
hidden
alcohol
overall
good
killians
on
steroids
comes
to
mind
in
the
end
its
a
good
pine
bomb
but
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
overpowering
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
lightly
foamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
fits
the
style
and
this
beer
well
closes
quite
dry
with
substantial
lingering
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
very
full
flavored
beer
malt
character
is
rich
but
the
hops
balance
it
well
a
little
too
bitter
and
earthy
at
the
finish
for
my
liking
overall
so
sorry
to
finish
this
if
only
id
bought
more
than
one
bottle
i
cant
really
judge
this
in
terms
of
style
because
its
complexity
puts
it
in
a
category
of
its
own
its
a
fascinating
journey
of
a
drink
certainly
enjoyable
i
might
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
next
time
considering
all
that
minty
earthiness
but
i
applaud
bear
republic
for
making
such
a
creative
kooky
yet
somehow
wellbalanced
ale
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
that
recipe
c
this
beer
is
quite
flavorful
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
hops
dont
overpower
as
can
be
the
case
with
some
west
coast
brews
i
recall
many
a
beer
where
i
dwelled
longingly
on
the
rich
malty
goodness
that
i
could
see
and
feel
but
could
not
taste
due
to
excessive
hop
happiness
this
beer
doesnt
do
that
o
a
very
solid
beer
perfect
if
you
want
an
ipa
style
beer
with
a
little
more
depth
overall
this
is
good
beer
and
hopheads
can
find
pleasure
in
the
nice
selection
of
bitter
oily
resinous
notes
in
here
but
the
beer
does
ultimately
suffer
because
of
the
low
abv
and
the
lack
of
sugars
with
the
hops
simply
overpowering
everything
else
making
the
beer
seem
imbalanced
and
in
need
of
a
lot
more
fruity
sugary
notes
o
as
a
scottish
ale
i
say
well
done
prefer
it
over
kiltlifter
and
old
chub
hands
down
as
an
amberred
i
say
no
theres
way
to
much
going
on
here
to
be
one
of
them
taste
and
mouthfeel
coffee
hint
of
caramel
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
definitely
tasted
the
piney
hops
but
they
didnt
overwhelm
the
malt
definitely
a
malt
forward
beer
though
im
not
a
major
fan
of
coffee
it
was
a
manageable
and
balanced
coffee
flavor
got
a
little
sweeter
as
it
warmed
which
cut
the
coffee
well
i
might
have
scored
this
a
little
lower
because
of
that
coffee
but
id
also
like
to
think
i
was
more
unbiased
than
that
in
the
end
this
is
ok
to
good
beer
i
think
it
has
some
strong
points
but
i
just
dont
get
the
high
ratings
it
isnt
a
perfect
example
of
a
style
an
awful
reason
to
score
a
beer
highly
imo
but
i
get
it
or
unique
and
special
or
you
know
just
an
amazing
beer
a
good
reason
to
score
highly
o
this
beer
improved
over
time
i
thought
it
a
little
too
bitter
for
the
style
but
it
seemed
to
sweeten
up
as
it
finished
wish
i
had
another
o
this
really
is
a
quality
red
ale
lightly
spiced
and
with
a
good
hop
profile
have
had
this
numerous
times
throughout
the
years
but
never
sat
down
and
reviewed
this
til
now
definitely
a
classic
for
this
style
and
an
easy
drinker
at
that
a
good
regular
drinking
beer
reminds
me
of
dales
pale
ale
very
similar
and
smooth
o
this
is
a
really
nice
moderately
hoppy
red
with
a
smooth
6

abv
would
drink
again
dark
mahogany
sprinkled
with
bits
of
sediment
and
topped
by
a
fat
luscious
looking
head
rich
caramel
and
bread
smell
accompanied
by
dark
fruit
pine
sap
and
orange
the
flavor
opens
with
some
toasted
caramel
malt
which
is
quickly
covered
by
a
blanket
of
pine
needles
and
grapefruit
zest
some
nutty
and
tealike
flavors
commingle
with
the
hops
medium
bodied
and
surprisingly
crisp
with
a
solid
bitterness
i
thought
this
was
a
little
too
sweet
the
other
night
but
now
it
seems
just
right
drinks
smooth
and
is
easy
drinking
and
would
probably
be
alot
better
fresh
o
i
enjoyed
the
beer
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
i
would
definitely
drink
this
if
given
the
chance
again
wont
go
seeking
it
but
it
is
worth
trying
just
for
the
unusual
balance
between
styles
anyway
this
is
an
excellent
beer
worth
checking
out
o
red
and
hoppy
nice
carmel
balance
othough
abv
a
little
high
a
nice
sessionable
uncomplicated
straightforward
red
ale
smell
is
at
first
like
an
ipa
hoppy
and
flowery
but
with
an
undertone
of
malt
tastes
like
a
really
good
ipa
smells
hoppy
but
with
a
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
matches
well
not
sure
what
style
this
beer
really
is
but
whatever
it
is
id
definitely
drink
it
again
its
the
west
coast
bighop
flavor
aesthetic
i
realize
but
not
my
thing
life
is
too
short
to
have
to
grimace
and
wince
as
youre
sipping
some
aggressively
hopped
beers
and
the
best
part
of
all
despite
the
smell
its
not
really
sweet
hops
are
ample
and
the
bitterness
lingers
for
quite
a
long
time
the
anticipation
and
the
finish
stand
out
in
this
beer
with
each
taste
i
bury
my
nose
in
the
glass
and
inhale
for
a
bit
before
drinking
then
sit
and
wait
for
the
finish
to
finish
it
goes
for
a
long
time
i
dont
often
take
this
long
to
drink
a
beer
i
dont
find
challenging
red
rocket
is
a
robust
red
ale
it
is
very
hoppy
with
the
malt
playing
a
minor
role
in
comparison
still
goes
down
smooth
fans
of
red
ales
will
thoroughly
enjoy
this
one
with
its
deep
red
body
and
sheets
of
lace
nothing
too
fancy
about
it
just
a
really
solid
brew
this
beer
is
a
clear
deep
dark
orange
color
with
little
head
the
nose
is
subtle
but
matches
the
taste
this
is
more
ipa
then
red
ale
it
is
very
hoppy
and
very
west
coast
the
hops
are
sharp
and
quite
piney
there
is
a
bit
of
citrus
in
there
as
well
but
its
very
piney
and
has
a
nice
dry
finish
there
is
little
malt
flavor
that
sneaks
past
the
hops
but
a
subtle
toffee
and
caramel
flavor
if
you
look
for
it
this
beer
has
a
pretty
light
feel
and
is
easy
drinking
a
solid
hopped
up
red
pours
a
crystalline
tree
resin
red
with
a
sturdy
offwhite
head
that
disappears
slowly
with
lots
of
lacing
a
lot
of
reds
in
my
experience
are
hazy
this
one
is
not
i
dont
consider
that
a
plus
or
a
minus
just
something
to
note
the
beer
looks
gorgeous
so
whatever
strong
fruitiness
on
the
nose
smells
of
burnt
cherry
marmalade
and
graham
cracker
the
latter
being
the
toasted
malts
i
suppose
on
the
first
sip
i
got
sour
cherry
cappuccino
which
was
weird
and
lots
of
hops
unfortunately
i
also
got
some
shallow
yet
apparent
metallic
notes
which
were
definitely
not
desirable
on
subsequent
sips
the
weird
coffee
notes
disappeared
and
more
of
the
caramelly
malts
showed
through
the
tinny
metallic
taste
persisted
but
was
more
of
an
annoyance
and
not
overpowering
still
there
was
the
strong
hops
bitterness
intruding
on
the
finish
over
done
a
bit
i
think
overall
the
beer
is
very
well
crafted
but
could
be
more
well
balanced
with
either
less
hops
or
more
malts
otherwise
what
are
we
brewing
here
a
red
or
an
ipa
i
cant
tell
anyway
i
still
recommend
trying
this
beer
and
will
try
it
again
myself
paired
with
a
sweet
food
like
bbq
sauce
chickenpork
this
beer
is
probably
fantastic
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
although
youre
expecting
it
to
be
a
red
and
it
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
poured
it
in
a
glass
and
got
a
nice
head
good
mouth
feel
not
too
heavy
beer
has
a
nice
look
to
it
dark
red
smells
hoppy
to
me
overall
i
like
this
beer
just
expected
a
red
and
got
a
red
ipa
overall
good
stuff
good
with
conversation
better
with
lunch
a
wellrounded
drinking
beer
this
is
a
very
good
red
ale
probably
one
of
my
favorites
bear
republic
once
again
comes
shining
through
overall
very
little
carbonation
i
honestly
believe
the
overhopped
american
craft
beers
are
fraught
with
with
hops
so
that
they
can
hide
the
higher
alcohol
content
i
mean
i
understand
the
greatness
of
brewing
a
beer
and
calling
it
your
own
but
i
just
cant
get
into
the
part
of
dumping
mass
hops
into
a
brew
it
doesnt
do
anything
but
add
pine
tar
grapefruit
or
if
youre
lucky
a
floral
ness
to
the
brew
i
suppose
thats
my
rant
for
the
evening
but
i
really
was
expecting
a
little
something
different
its
not
bad
in
fact
its
good
but
i
guess
i
prefer
my
beer
with
a
more
balanced
malt
to
hop
ratio
or
maybe
a
little
barley
i
can
even
appreciate
a
ricedup
kirin
but
no
bud
but
the
mass
teabagging
of
hops
just
seems
to
be
the
american
way
and
i
dont
agree
with
it
great
smell
of
hops
and
very
creamy
in
texture
it
is
unlike
any
other
red
ale
its
like
a
red
ale
mixed
in
with
a
porter
but
very
good
and
better
it
also
has
a
few
coffee
aromas
and
qualities
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
very
good
i
would
say
definaity
worth
a
try
overall
have
to
say
that
i
was
disapointed
with
the
mellow
smoke
finish
i
think
the
hops
definitly
needed
to
be
present
to
create
a
better
balance
i
will
also
say
that
i
got
this
as
a
single
from
the
grocery
store
and
that
it
may
have
been
sitting
for
a
while
allowing
the
hops
to
fade
i
will
revisit
and
update
if
nessicary

feel
gives
way
to
a
dry
slightly

finish
there
are
other
imperial
read
highly
hopped
reds
with
hop
profiles
that
i
much
prefer
to
this
one
but
the

points
o
3

not
a
fan
of
redsambers
in
general
but
this
takes
it
in
a
direction
with
some
identity
its
an
interesting
beer
if
only
because
i
cant
quite
figure
it
out
but
mystery
is
nice
this
doesnt
fit
guidelines
well
as
its
a
roasty
but
sweet
beer
the
former
makes
it
an
amber
the
latter
a
scottish
im
not
much
of
a
scotch
ale
guy
so
i
like
the
experiment
but
ultimately
thats
what
it
is
i
feel
the
same
way
about
this
beer
as
a
cool
concept
car
fun
to
think
about
and
try
but
impractical
for
real
life
use
red
rocket
from
the
bear
good
half
finger
head
on
a
clear
amber
body
with
some
lacing
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
the
flavor
has
a
great
caramel
malt
backbone
with
citrus
light
pine
and
earthy
hops
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
very
flavorful
and
even
more
drinkable
excited
to
see
these
beers
in
florida
overall
definitely
a
good
choice
for
a
red
ale
plenty
of
flavor
well
balanced
and
smooth
to
boot
overall
this
beer
was
a
little
overthetop
for
my
tastes
if
you
like
big
overly
bitter
caustic
grapefruit
hop
forward
beers
from
the
west
coast
then
this
is
probably
going
to
be
for
you
if
you
like
a
more
balanced
offering
as
i
do
look
elsewhere
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
and
complex
red
ale
with
all
of
the
flavors
complimenting
each
other
without
being
overly
sweet
i
find
myself
contemplative
after
each
sip
enjoying
the
wonderful
symphony
of
flavors
highly
recommend
o
touted
as
an
aggressively
hoped
bastardized
scottish
style
red
ale
this
brew
is
highly
original
flavorful
and
a
joy
to
experience
pours

with
about
a
finger
of

when
held

it

and
some

i
also
get
some
maltiness
in
the
nose
hoppy
up
front
but
a
well
balanced
maltiness
with
a
nice
flavoring
of

i

pick
up
some
slight
dark
dried
fruit
slightly
sweet
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
alcohol
is
hidden
mouthfeel
is
moderate
wellcarbonated
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
great
looking
and
i
love
the
high
hoppiness
paired
with
the
malt
i
would
like
to
see
more
amber
ales
hopped
like
this
the
only
other
one
that
i
have
tried
similar
to
this
is
shorts
aorta
ale
and
ive
really
enjoyed
both
overall
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
highest
rated
beers
from
everyday
styles
i
wish
i
could
get
this
at

scotch
red
ale
is
the
style
but
the
hopped
up
profile
of
this
one
makes
it
amazing
o
definitely
an
above
average
red
ale
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
is
just
a
bit
maltheavy
for
my
tastes
o
a
fine
ale
im
a
fan
of
bear
republic
a
brewery
from
which
ive
come
to
expect
great
things
highly
recommended
yum
overall
an
exceptionally
good
amber
ale
and
up
with
my
favourites
definitely
recommended
red
rocket
ale
pours
a
dark
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
sized
lasting
head
there
is
a
nice
dry
hoppy
aroma
to
this
beer
the
taste
is
quite
strong
a
strong
blend
of
hops
and
malts
but
has
an
almost
sour
taste
slight
caramel
and
nutty
flavors
come
through
espically
at
the
end
a
nice
strong
flavor
but
a
bit
much
on
the
pallet
overall
a
nice
beer
very
unique
but
worth
a
try
i
see
this
one
being
a
selective
taste
type
beer
overall
carmel
raisin
and
dark
cherry
flavors
balance
well
with
the
floral
hop
flavors
an
excellent
amber
ale
worthy
of
the
bear
republic
name
recommended
o
i
liked
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
a
good
scotch
alea
good
american
interpretation
but
not
spectacular
ill
have
another
o
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
very
nice
balance
of
maltynesssweetness
leading
right
into
the
hoppyness
and
then
bitters
very
well
done
brew
would
love
it
try
it
on
tap
ogood
tasting
beer
good
amber
hoppy
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
of
these
overall
a
bit
aggressive
but
great
nonetheless
on
tap
pours
a
brownish
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
a
light
hop
presence
and
a
slight
nuttiness
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
some
caramel
a
light
nuttiness
and
some
mild
floral
hops
the
finish
has
a
light
bitterness
and
some
lingering
caramel
and
nuttiness
medium
body
medium
carbonation
i
would
consider
this
an
ipa
overall
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
whatsoever
because
of
the
hops
if
you
prefer
your
ambers
and
reds
to
have
a
more
toasted
bready
sweet
malt
feeling
then
you
wont
like
this
burnt
hops
trying
a
red
rocket
in
michigan
with
my
bro
in
law
the
beer
poured
a
beautiful
rich
red
thick
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
rich
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
sent
bubbles
every
where
in
this
one
giving
it
a
great
smoothness
and
opening
up
the
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
a
smooth
finish
and
outstanding
experience
over
all
this
is
a
joy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
huge
and
gratifying
great
mouth
feel
and
perfectly
carbonted
this
will
become
your
favorite
red
at
the
first
sip
i
bet
you
a
beer
on
it
o
a
really
great
unusual
beer
that
i
must
have
again
somehow
i
instantly
forgot
that
the
bottle
said
this
was
kind
of
a
red
ale
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
chestnut
deep
reddish
this
beer
was
in
color
scent
offered
pine
slight
citrus
pungent
hops
the
taste
was
exactly
what
the
nose
told
me
only
slightly
less
which
is
very
appropriate
for
a
india
red
ale
the
balance
was
right
on
target
this
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
bear
republic
these
guys
know
their
ipas
watch
out
stone
will
definitely
try
again
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
appearing
beer
that
delivers
on
its
promise
it
looks
bold
it
tastes
bold
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
because
of
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
but
nice
on
a
friday
or
saturday
night
to
pair
with
some
equally
bold
food
like
pasta
with
spicy
red
sauce
and
garlic
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
smooth
easydrinking
feel
and
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
fantastic
here
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
strong
hoppy
finish
just
makes
this
one
go
down
way
too
fast
an
excellent
first
brew
from
bear
republic
im
sure
to
be
loading
up
with
their
beers
on
my
trip
up
to
new
jersey
this
summer
not
sure
how
this
is
a
scottish
red
ale
but
the
bottle
also
mentioned
they
break
style
molds
this
could
pass
as
a
few
styles
im
just
rating
on
personal
preference
and
i
enjoyed
it
no
matter
what
you
call
it
thanks
again
papat444
for
the
bottle
overall
really
solid
red
ale
tangy
at
times
sweet
in
others
certainly
a
complex
multilayered
interesting
beer
one
i
should
buy
more
often
in
the
future
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
were
the
notes
of
burnt
caramel
and
butter
in
the
nose
these
were
spot
on
and
made
the
beer
really
inviting
this
beer
actually
smells
exclusively
like
any
good
scotch
ale
should
but
the
difference
comes
when
you
get
to
tasting
it
the
malts
are
a
bit
milder
and
sweeter
than
the
traditional
style
which
is
where
the
blending
comes
in
the
hop
inclusions
are
a
nice
addition
but
we
wish
they
had
been
more
robust
in
the
nose
which
would
have
given
it
the
edge
we
were
looking
for
overall
a
really
tasty
amber
ale
usually
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
bear
republic
have
done
a
great
job
here
on
tap
at
sea
rocket
in
san
diego
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
bear
republic
this
beer
is
complex
and
delicious
pours
and
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
tan
head
that
results
in
decent
lacing
there
is
a
quick
hit
of
carmel
malt
followed
by
a
burst
of
sharp
citrus
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
creamy
malty
backbone
with
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
doa
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
muddled
rich
rubycopper
coloring
with
a
dense
offwhite
frothy
head
that
remains
low
profile
and
retains
well
aromas
of
wet
fresh
hops
and
a
rich
roasted
caramel
backbone
flavors
are
rich
and
tangy
with
a
slightly
sour
caramel
backbone
supporting
a
spiced
and
bitter
hops
presence
hops
are
resiny
with
a
rich
and
floral
blending
to
it
very
smooth
progression
of
flavors
great
lacing
left
along
the
glass
as
you
drink
and
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
the
aftertaste
is
hoppy
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
caramel
linger
left
behind
for
a
smooth
clingy
finish
that
is
enjoyable
good
beer
o
great
taste
great
smell
weak
feel
poured
with
a
very
thick
light
beige
head
that
lingered
a
while
deep
reddish
brown
color
that
was
dark
but
translucent
roasted
caramel
malt
flavor
offset
by
a
restrained
hoppiness
pleasant
aftertase
was
a
good
blend
of
the
flavor
characteristics
fairly
rich
wellcarbonated
mouthfeel
bordering
on
creamy
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
has
an
odd
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
textbook
hoppy
amber
perfectly
executed
reminds
me
of
5am
saint
at
times
but
pulls
ahead
in
malt
complexity
and
body
by
a
substantial
margin
just
an
awesome
beer
ridiculous
drinkability
too
o
gotta
say
even
though
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
it
but
my
expectations
were
high
it
looks
great
and
all
3
other
beers
from
this
brewer
that
i
am
familiar
with
are
really
exceptional
reminiscent
of
but
not
quite
up
to
par
with
rogue
mogul
madness
still
reasonably
priced
flavorful
and
easy
to
recommend
o
i
was
surprised
at
the
bitterness
and
i
think
this
one
shares
a
lot
of
flavor
characteristics
of
a
rye
beer
the
flavors
improve
and
balance
as
it
warms
and
the
sweetness
begins
to
show
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
i
really
enjoyed
it
very
good
especially
for
under
5bomber
this
is
a
very
drinkable
balanced
smooth
beer
its
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
overall
pretty
well
crafted
beer
with
a
tad
too
hop
bitter
presence
in
finish
though
that
throws
this
beer
off
balanced
somewhat
imo
its
good
its
flavorful
just
requires
a
little
force
to
get
through
12ozs
notes
robust
flavor
with
medium
to
full
body
mouthfeel
is
slick
from
the
hops
and
finish
is
dry
an
awesome
brew
with
amazing
drinkability
not
my
favorite
brew
from
bear
republic
but
a
tasty
one
and
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
in
the
future
note
live
review
the
rams
head
in
west
chester
penna
very
good
worth
seeking
out
o
great
beer
deffinitly
a
west
coast
influenced
amber
peronally
think
of
it
as
an
indian
amber
ale
than
just
an
amber
ale
overall
b
points
for
balance
in
a
relativelyrestrained
big
beer
o
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
hoppy
due
to
its
higher
rating
i
didnt
realize
that
it
was
going
to
be
so
well
balanced
and
just
a
delicious
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
for
hours
and
not
tire
of
the
taste
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
from
br
but
of
course
it
was
thats
a
great
brewery
americanizing
the
heck
out
of
a
scottish
ale
is
something
that
seems
right
up
their
alley
for
a
reason
moderately
carbonated
oily
slick
dry
in
the
end
beautiful
red
ale
thick
head
that
almost
defies
gravity
rich
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
sent
bubbles
every
where
in
this
one
giving
it
a
great
smoothness
and
opening
up
the
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
a
smooth
finish
and
outstanding
experience
over
all
overall
a
very
tasty
red
ale
and
a
classic
example
of
the
style
hoppy
and
fruity
but
with
enough
malt
sweetness
to
remind
you
that
its
not
an
ipa
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
drink
no
matter
the
occasion
o
great
amberred
really
enjoyed
it
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
1
inch
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
there
is
a
good
amount
of
sediment
seen
floating
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
and
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
there
is
a
pretty
assertive
and
almost
medicinal
bitterness
that
sticks
around
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
overall
this
beer
is
relly
good
as
many
other
reviews
attest
it
could
be
paired
with
red
meat
dishes
and
compliment
ideally
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
to
this
one
often
it
sets
the
standard
o
ill
definately
be
seeking
this
out
more
often
i
sadly
forgot
how
great
this
one
is
a
very
underrated
brew
not
a
bad
beer
overall
it
was
actually
a
bit
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
to
think
i
ordered
something
different
and
picked
this
as
a
second
option
quite
solid
entry
into
the
strong
bear
republic
lineup
yep
i
prefer
a
racer
5
or
hope
red
rye
but
this
is
a
solid
change
of
pace
classic
beer
here
im
impressed
every
time
i
buy
one
and
it
turns
out
to
be
fresh
lots
of
balance
full
flavored
with
big
juicy
hop
flavors
up
front
followed
up
with
the
toasted
caramel
finishes
dry
and
refreshing
very
gulpable
body
is
very
nice
it
is
rich
a
thick
enough
without
being
sweet
and
cloying
well
done
bear
republic
but
please
add
some
damn
bottling
dates
thats
what
keeps
me
from
buying
your
beers
more
often
than
not
overalla
great
beer
nice
hop
profile
but
has
elements
that
i
have
not
found
in
other
beers
well
balanced
with
the
caramel
malt
taste
and
it
is
not
overpowering
i
have
yet
to
be
disapointed
by
bear
republic
edit
after
trying
it
again
at
a
warmer
temperature
it
was
a
little
more
mellow
and
i
got
better
flavors
out
of
it
im
not
sure
if
you
should
drink
it
at
a
warmer
temperature
but
im
bumping
up
the
scores
to
reflect
it
mouthfeel
is
not
as
carbonated
as
i
generally
like
but
very
refreshing
not
too
oily
and
just
the
right
amount
of
body
to
make
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
edit
i
think
this
may
have
been
an
old
bottle
but
there
is
no
date
so
its
getting
reviewed
asis
if
there
had
been
a
date
on
bottle
id
throw
out
the
review
overall
it
is
hard
to
review
this
beer
relative
to
the
style
since
red
ale
is
kind
of
a
vague
mutt
of
a
beer
genre
in
the
first
place
it
was
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
but
not
quite
up
to
the
standards
set
by
other
brews
from
the
bear
republic
i
would
recommend
hop
rod
rye
or
racer
5
over
this
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amber
with
big
fluffy
tightly
bubbled
head
bready
malts
with
spicy
fruitcake
hop
nose
big
malty
taste
with
piney
citrus
hops
and
dark
fruits
very
smooth
mouthfeel
immediate
finish
rather
wet
then
drying
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
an
excellent
west
coast
style
hoppy
amber
drink
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
am
not
normally
a
red
ale
fan
but
when
you
mix
the
juicy
hops
and
dough
behind
it
it
changes
to
more
a
more
ipa
type
flavor
id
come
back
to
this
one
again
the
ale
pours
hazy
redamber
with
a
thin
creamy
light
khaki
head
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
highly
hoppypine
and
citrus
with
low
yet
noticeable
toasty
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
highly
hoppy
loads
of
pine
and
solidly
bitter
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dry
prick
of
hop
bitterness
then
a
biscuity
caramel
malt
comes
through
well
after
the
swallow
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
the
body
and
carbonation
are
medium
overall
a
deliciously
hoppy
yet
some
nuances
that
make
it
more
interesting
than
most
overall
i
have
never
tried
any
bear
republic
beers
and
this
put
them
on
my
radar
really
nice
beer
for
this
style
and
it
reminds
me
of
zoe
from
maine
beer
co
its
a
good
beer
for
any
beer
drinking
occasion
if
into
hops
definitely
pick
up
if
not
beware
its
a
bit
too
bitter
for
some
do
im
gonna
say
this
this
beer
doesnt
get
near
the
love
it
deserves
tons
of
flavor
packed
into
a
relatively
for
craft
beer
ha
low
abv
definitely
comes
recommend
if
citrus
hops
are
you
thing
or
if
you
dont
think
an
amberred
can
wow
you
o
the
flavors
could
have
been
a
little
better
represented
fairly
well
balanced
but
a
little
watery
still
a
good
beer
but
definitely
could
do
better
overall
i
was
wondering
why
this
beer
was
so
popular
now
i
know
this
is
a
real
surprisingly
good
one
nice
job
there
bear
nice
fresh
brew
doesnt
have
the
ashy
bitterness
of
an
ipa
but
at
the
same
time
it
could
have
upped
the
hops
a
bit
and
i
wouldnt
be
complaining
it
seemed
like
a
just
perfect
balance
of
alchohol
and
hops
in
this
beer
really
good
flow
to
it
i
liked
drinking
this
one
o
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
red
ale
but
enjoyed
its
use
of
hops
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
amber
ale
the
nose
had
a
great
mix
of
caramel
malts
and
hops
while
the
taste
had
light
hops
and
many
more
malts
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
of
this
and
id
definitely
have
it
again
very
drinkable
o
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
this
was
an
ipa
that
sat
on
the
shelf
a
few
months
too
long
malty
this
was
one
hoppy
amber
as
a
hop
head
im
impressed
but
at
the
same
time
if
i
wanted
hops
id
drink
an
ipa
i
was
kinda
craving
that
spicy
malty
bready
taste
of
the
style
this
is
still
very
good
though
overall
this
is
a
solid
hoppy
amber
good
balance
and
a
nice
hop
profile
o
ill
have
to
try
this
again
when
i
can
be
sure
its
fresh
theres
no
date
on
this
but
i
dont
think
this
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
a
bit
cidery
even
not
something
im
enjoying
at
all
big
plum
raisin
aroma
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
mildly
carbonated
bit
of
nut
presence
but
plum
raisin
dominates
i
think
this
may
have
gone
over
a
bit
as
the
reviews
and
label
mention
hops
and
dont
really
mention
the
plum
alcohol
best
i
can
tell
it
was
brewed
in
july
2010
the
cpj
od
i
love
bear
republic
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
love
the
style
love
the
malt
and
hop
combo
tried
it
next
to
a
racer
5
while
it
is
no
racer
5
its
still
delicious
albeit
less
bracingly
bitter
and
hop
forward
good
stuff
o
some
rye
like
characteristics
and
an
overall
very
solid
well
balanced
beer
i
enjoyed
the
whole
bomber
and
will
pick
this
up
again
bear
republic
gains
again
on
my
breweries
to
watch
list
4
5
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
gorgeous
red
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
one
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
retained
itself
well
and
left
consistent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
bready
malts
grassy
hops
and
little
brown
sugar
the
flavors
were
just
as
balanced
as
the
aroma
with
the
caramel
malt
and
herbal
hops
perfectly
accentuating
each
other
i
also
tasted
toffee
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
pine
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
light
very
sessionable
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
i
didnt
think
i
was
in
for
such
a
treat
but
i
guess
i
should
of
since
im
a
fan
bear
republics
other
brews
e
g
racer
5
hop
rod
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
hoppiness
this
amberred
ale
possesses
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
clear
red
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
lacing
doesnt
stick
too
much
but
it
holds
a
decent
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
there
is
a
sweet
malt
backbone
to
the
beer
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
much
like
the
nose
its
hoppy
and
sweet
all
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
gives
off
some
bitterness
and
a
dry
feeling
after
the
swallow
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
red
ale
it
was
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
red
ale
but
it
had
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
to
balance
out
all
those
hops
i
found
this
beer
to
have
good
drinkability
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
another
one
but
after
two
the
bitterness
might
wear
on
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
it
was
heavy
on
the
hops
but
the
caramel
malts
kept
them
in
check
nicely
and
when
combined
they
made
for
a
pretty
good
flavor
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
body
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
felt
just
a
little
watery
and
would
have
been
perfect
with
a
medium
amount
of
body
to
it
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
red
ale
the
hop
profile
seems
like
it
would
make
for
a
good
red
ale
to
drink
during
a
warm
summer
afternoon
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
are
a
red
ale
fan
or
if
you
like
hoppy
beers
its
a
good
example
of
how
well
a
red
ale
can
hold
up
to
a
bunch
of
hops
so
far
i
would
say
that
this
is
one
my
favorite
red
ales
i
like
it
slightly
better
then
cow
catcher
it
tastes
similar
but
this
beer
has
a
heavier
and
better
tasting
hop
presence
this
was
another
great
beer
from
bear
republic
so
far
every
beer
i
have
had
from
them
has
been
pretty
top
notch
and
it
seems
like
they
got
a
knack
for
the
hops
i
will
have
to
move
on
to
some
of
their
bigger
bottles
next
i
know
what
they
can
do
with
hops
but
i
am
interested
to
see
what
they
got
in
store
when
it
come
to
darker
beers
looks
like
i
am
gonna
have
to
try
big
bear
black
stout
next
i
have
high
hopes
good
job
bear
republic
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
that
has
a
nice
aroma
to
accompany
these
aspects
in
my
opinion
are
the
most
important
when
it
comes
to
a
beer
but
with
some
work
on
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
this
could
be
a
great
one
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
o
a
great
red
ale
probably
the
best
commercial
one
ive
had
o
very
good
amber
ale
first
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
and
will
be
happy
to
try
more
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
i
look
forward
to
getting
another
bottle
overall
i
really
enjoy
a
standard
irish
red
but
this
is
an
excellent
hoppedup
american
version
i
will
be
looking
for
again
and
recommend
that
you
do
the
same
fantastic
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
w
a
nice
off
white
head
which
quickly
disappears
great
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
smell
is
fantastic
caramel
malt
hops
pine
are
the
main
characters
really
amazing
nose
taste
is
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
and
excellent
for
the
style
feel
is
really
smooth
with
a
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
excellent
balance
between
the
two
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
another
winner
from
bear
republic
overall
everything
i
have
had
from
bear
republic
has
been
well
done
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
an
amber
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
one
this
is
a
solid
beer
this
is
my
4th
beer
from
bear
republic
and
it
solidifies
their
awesomeness
like
i
said
before
great
balance
between
malt
and
hops
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
staple
in
my
fridge
when
i
want
something
both
malty
and
hoppy
great
job
bear
republic
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
it
almost
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
with
a
darker
malts
and
a
more
complex
sweetness
the
citrusy
hops
balance
it
out
nicely
the
beer
is
quite
heavy
i
guess
it
is
following
its
scottish
ale
description
here
it
is
so
creamy
and
goes
down
nicely
almost
perfect
drinker
thanks
to
nikkis
for
featuring
bear
rep
this
past
month
o
satisfying
great
mix
between
an
ipa
style
ale
and
a
red
ale
overall
a
nice
beer
although
i
thought
i
liked
it
more
the
past
few
times
ive
tried
it
o
i
do
tend
to
like
hoppy
ambers
much
more
than
traditional
versions
of
the
style
and
this
is
no
exception
another
quality
beer
from
bear
republic
overall
a
good
beer
to
introduce
people
to
amberred
ales
with
and
a
great
beer
overall
very
drinkable
and
people
friendly
but
for
those
looking
for
a
hoppier
amberred
ale
you
might
wanna
look
elsewhere
in
my
own
opinion
22oz
bottle
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
lots
of
ruby
hues
and
a
half
inch
of
head
tons
of
lacing
aroma
is
boozey
and
a
bit
sweet
piney
hop
aroma
taste
is
some
more
of
that
sweet
malt
flavor
with
some
bitter
pine
towards
the
end
tastes
a
bit
like
a
scotch
ale
or
even
a
barleywine
surprising
amount
of
boozey
flavor
for
the
beer
that
isnt
all
that
high
in
the
abv
department
somewhat
resinous
dry
mouthfeel
this
one
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
overall
a
pretty
solid
hoppy
red
ale
worth
grabbing
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
hop
rod
rye
not
a
total
drainpour
but
i
dumped
it
after
half
so
i
could
have
a
beer
that
was
good
interesting
beer
not
what
you
typically
think
of
in
a
red
could
pass
as
a
highly
hopped
scotch
ale
variant
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
floaties
as
this
brew
is
unfiltered
a
nice
ecru
1
finger
head
and
lacing
that
will
not
quit
i
mean
my
entire
glass
is
covered
with
beautiful
frothy
rings
the
smell
is
malty
imagine
my
suprise
upon
first
gulp
i
was
ambushed
with
hops
a
red
with
a
hop
wallop
ohhh
me
likey
the
finish
is
balanced
with
raisinette
malt
and
i
am
left
with
a
alcohol
warming
sensation
as
this
sweet
juice
goes
down
the
best
of
both
worlds
here
the
great
flavor
of
a
red
with
ample
hops
and
crisp
finish
this
is
by
far
the
best
amber
ale
ive
ever
had
simply
an
amazing
brew
bear
republic
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
eye
this
beer
the
hop
rod
rye
and
racer
5
are
all
top
notch
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
in
the
future
o
great
amber
ale
seems
to
mesh
several
styles
together
ipa
scottish
ale
red
ale
very
well
done
and
tasty
terrific
beer
a
dark
colored
red
ale
significant
cascade
hops
aroma
coupled
with
some
deeply
roasted
malt
character
makes
for
a
rich
satisfying
glass
finishes
clean
with
a
harmonious
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
makes
me
forget
about
wanting
nbs
fat
tire
overall
im
disappointed
in
this
i
feel
like
its
a
bit
hollow
and
never
followed
through
based
on
its
decently
appealing
appearance
and
taste
great
malt
base
very
flavorful
and
satisfying
overall
this
is
another
good
beer
from
bear
republic
its
a
hop
lovers
red
thats
for
certain
wish
it
was
slightly
maltier
actually
o
i
could
almost
see
the
surfboard
in
my
periferal
vision
california
hops
and
then
some
really
nice
overall
excellent
red
ale
and
one
that
i
would
get
again
this
one
absolutely
blasted
off
and
left
me
in
awe
the
very
definition
of
a
west
coast
red
ale
this
is
a
huge
beer
personally
i
would
prefer
less
hops
and
less
alcohol
for
a
more
drinkable
beer
but
then
it
just
wouldnt
be
red
rocket
o
this
is
a
style
im
not
that
familiar
with
but
i
spoiled
myself
with
nugget
nectar
this
is
your
example
of
a
balanced
amber
ale
my
experience
with
this
was
more
malt
forward
which
may
suggest
some
age
but
no
indication
of
bottling
date
because
this
is
so
drinkable
and
smells
and
looks
great
i
enjoyed
this
beer
vey
much
cant
help
but
think
of
a
certain
southpark
scene
that
i
wanted
gone
from
my
memory
though
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
deep
red
with
a
2
finger
beige
foam
head
that
lasted
several
minutes
nice
citrus
aroma
lots
of
different
flavors
bitter
at
first
becoming
sweet
with
caramel
and
citrus
flavors
hoppy
feel
then
more
malty
at
the
finish
fine
craft
beer
a
rich
ruby
red
on
the
pour
with
a
nice
tan
lasting
head
with
good
lacing
sweet
caramel
malt
fruity
spices
and
a
nice
sweet
floral
earthy
hops
fill
the
nose
taste
is
nice
sweet
caramel
malts
with
nice
fruity
tones
some
yeast
and
nice
hops
flavor
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
along
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
finish
is
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
some
yeast
and
fruit
spices
ending
with
a
nice
hops
edge
to
add
balance
a
brew
with
malty
character
and
a
persistent
dry
earthy
hops
bitterness
overall
an
interesting
but
good
and
drinkable
brew
red
in
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
piney
aroma
with
lots
of
hops
evident
flavor
is
also
very
hoppy
with
less
malt
than
id
expect
from
a
red
ale
would
have
liked
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
to
balance
crisp
mouthfeel
o
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
that
seems
to
have
everything
going
for
it
the
malts
and
hops
are
both
everpresent
and
the
abv
of
6
8
is
well
masked
i
will
probably
pick
this
up
again
and
would
definitely
order
it
on
tap
if
available
for
an
amber
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
hoppier
ones
ive
had
the
bitterness
could
rival
many
ipas
its
certainly
not
bad
for
an
ipa
if
it
was
one
but
for
an
amber
its
pretty
aggressive
o
mostly
bitter
with
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
did
have
an
excellent
appearance
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
i
would
consider
it
to
be
sessionable
except
that
its
alcohol
content
is
a
bit
too
high
i
will
definitely
need
to
buy
and
drink
more
of
this
very
happy
with
the
purchase
worth
every
penny
truly
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
hoppy
red
ale
it
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
luckily
it
is
fairly
welldistributed
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
here
in
maine
ill
get
more
next
time
im
in
ma
a
well
hopped
bitter
amber
ale
american
to
the
core
o
a
great
tasting
unique
and
well
balanced
ale
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
thats
good
in
this
case
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
great
levels
of
carbonation
there
is
a
good
film
left
on
the
inside
of
your
mouth
with
each
sip
as
well
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
stands
up
to
the
better
ambers
ive
had
very
hoppy
yet
balanced
drinkable
and
complex
m
carbonation
is
perfect
present
and
not
overpowering
smooth
flow
and
great
warming
aftertaste
refreshing
with
a
lightmedium
body
bravo
overall
nothing
special
just
a
solid
red
ale
overall
impression
robust
yet
drinkable
and
extremely
flavorul
a
winning
combination
o
a
solid
red
ale
with
a
nice
level
of
dry
hoppiness
to
it
a
good
pairing
of
dry
hops
and
spiced
spruce
o
i
set
the
bar
high
for
this
beer
considering
the
brewery
and
it
has
surpassed
my
expectations
bear
republic
made
good
efforts
to
create
and
extraordinary
red
ale
a
great
beer
from
bear
republic
i
feel
they
are
in
a
class
of
their
own
with
this
one
selfdescribed
as
a
bastardized
scottish
ale
overall
wow
this
is
an
amber
ale
according
to
the
bros
its
hybrid
of
sorts
although
im
somehow
thinking
of
flanders
reds
and
not
scottish
reds
and
i
couldnt
agree
more
the
bottle
conditioning
really
allows
this
thing
to
be
a
flavorful
experience
like
no
other
bear
republic
once
again
shows
the
beauty
and
future
of
american
craft
brewing
in
this
rather
intense
beer
of
theirs
due
to
its
heaviness
its
not
something
i
could
sit
and
have
any
day
but
its
quite
recommended
close
to
as
perfectly
balanced
as
could
be
i
think
its
rich
and
flavorful
from
the
dark
roasted
malt
character
but
the
hops
come
in
and
accent
them
so
well
that
the
two
tastes
combine
perfectly
into
one
really
great
taste
pine
hops
rule
in
the
back
but
the
caramel
character
felt
in
the
malt
front
is
so
understated
that
it
becomes
a
work
of
art
some
booziness
in
the
taste
as
well
especially
detectable
once
its
warmed
up
a
bit
i
think
if
this
were
ever
so
slightly
more
carbonated
the
beer
would
be
a
bit
more
crisp
but
this
starts
with
a
creamier
mouthfeel
and
ends
closer
to
the
crisp
side
really
even
the
carbonation
is
nicely
balanced
overall
this
goes
right
alongside
hop
rod
rye
and
racer
5
as
a
few
in
my
top
20
favorite
beers
though
i
seem
to
remember
it
having
a
bigger
hop
presence
when
i
sampled
it
from
a
bomber
i
still
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
i
always
love
beers
which
blend
styles
and
blur
the
lines
of
what
category
a
beer
falls
under
this
isnt
quite
a
scottish
ale
and
its
not
quite
a
red
ale
yet
its
both
and
neither
at
the
same
time
plus
a
bottle
conditioned
brew
always
gains
points
from
me
keep
up
the
good
work
bear
republic
you
have
yet
to
disappoint
me
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
dark
mahogany
in
color
with
a
deep
haze
and
reddish
hue
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
very
brief
head
that
reduced
to
a
sticky
ring
on
the
glass
mostly
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
with
floral
hops
and
dark
fruit
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
on
the
oily
side
up

subdues
the
carbonation
a
bit
the
carbonation
slowly
intensifies
toward
the
finish
as
the
oily
feel
transitions
to
a
light
resinous
feel
dark
caramel
malt
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
dark
ripe
fruit
through
the
middle
hop
character
starts
slowly
but
builds
from
beginning
to
end
starting
with
floral
flavors
and
ending
with
pine
hop
bitterness
finishes
semidry
with
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
lots
of
subtle
complexity
in
aroma
flavor
and
feel
this
one
really
kind
of
messed
with
my
mind
at
first
when
i
took
my
first
whiff
all
i
got
was
bacon
grease
i
thought
csbosox
may
have
not
washed
my
glass
very
well
then
i
read
the
lable
and
picked
up
scottish
red
ale
and
things
started
to
make
more
sence
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
new
belguim
worthy
glass
dark
red
with
some
firey
hues
near
the
bottom
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
to
ample
beige
head
that
lasted
most
of
the
experience
the
nose
was
smokey
with
a
touch
of
roast
the
hops
didnt
really
come
out
to
play
until
the
beer
had
warmed
quite
a
bit
the
flavor
was
very
rich
with
chocolate
and
roast
along
with
some
peaty
smokey
flavor
a
touch
of
toffee
quite
full
bodied
and
silky
over
smooth
over
the
tongue
no
unpleasant
sensatiolns
at
all
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
id
drink
very
often
but
interesting
nonetheless
slainte
i
think
that
this
was
one
of
the
first
big
hoppy
american
ambers
that
i
experienced
back
when
i
first
really
got
into
craft
beer
and
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
it
still
holds
up
by
only
complaint
is
that
the
toasted
aspect
of
this
comes
on
a
bit
strong
at
times
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
quite
full
flavored
and
easy
drinking
for
the
relative
size
of
it
poured
a
very
slow
to
emerge
18
head
which
quickly
disappeared
to
lace
deep
ruddy
brown
color
and
when
held
to
bright
light
it
just
barely
has
a
maroon
tinge
smells
of
caramel
hops
ipa
taste
is
the
same
and
also
has
a
little
sweet
raisin
although
i
had
high
expectations
and
this
generally
gets
great
reviews
i
just
thought
my
sample
was
far
flatter
and
less
complicated
than
i
was
expecting
o
excellent
red
ale
i
have
tried
a
lot
of
things
from
bear
republic
and
have
yet
to
be
let
down
i
dont
know
if
i
could
do
a
six
pack
of
this
but
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
if
the
mood
was
right
oa
good
red
ale
at
a
good
price
cheers

dark
amber

a
small

profile
a
bready

taste
and
a

mouthful
is

and

overall
this
is
an
average
beer
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
nugget
nectar
turned
me
on
to
the
style
and
think
it
may
have
me
biased
on
my
reviews
of
amber
ales
but
im
trying
to
find
another
amber
ale
to
live
up
to
those
standards
o
a
highly
rated
beer
on
ba
i
see
it
everywhere
but
never
get
it
found
a
12ozer
for
1
59
so
i
said
mightaswell
for
me
this
is
just
another
mildly
sweet
red
ale
typical
can
be
found
by
half
the
brewers
around
here
i
had
a
higher
hope
for
it
as
it
seems
like
there
is
such
a
big
thing
how
west
coast
beers
are
overall
better
than
east
coast
beers
o
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
red
ales
second
only
to
nugget
nectar
and
peaks
king
crimson
however
this
is
a
lot
cheaper
so
its
a
better
deal
id
say
malty
for
everyone
and
a
little
bitter
for
us
hopheads
looks
nice
and
foamy
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
tinged
edges
1
finger
creamybubbled
head
leaves
behind
some
interesting
lacing
patterns
tons
of
citric
hop
flavor
and
smell
ambushes
me
repeatedly
sadly
i
find
that
the
malt
is
simply
too
weak
to
hold
up
to
the
aggressive
hopping
everything
seems
out
of
balance
to
me
both
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
ive
had
imperial
ipas
that
had
much
better
balance
between
malts
and
hops
than
this
thing
i
cant
even
smell
or
taste
the
malt
this
comes
across
to
me
as
a
poorly
done
ipa
not
as
a
red
ale
i
cant
find
any
yeasty
bready
presence
at
all
i
cant
find
any
malt
at
all
im
left
alone
with
one
trick
pony
citric
hops
thankfully
there
is
an
excellent
and
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
crisply
carbonated
the
texture
is
easily
the
strongest
suit
of
this
brew
im
not
impressed
overall
its
good
not
great
not
worthy
of
an
a
on
beer
advocate
but
good
too
pricey
for
me
to
buy
regularly
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
this
american
red
ale
poured
a
hazy
mahogany
color
it
produced
a
nice
thick
head
and
had
excellent
retention
there
was
a
nice
amount
of
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
full
of
roasted
caramel
malt
and
had
hits
of
pine
cones
according
to
the
bottle
this
beer
was
bottle
conditioned
which
explains
its
very
active
carbonation
the
taste
comprised
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
caramel
there
is
also
a
nice
amount
of
bitter
hop
flavor
and
gives
this
ale
some
balls
overall
very
good
beer
i
was
not
disappointed
o
overall
a
great
red
ale
on
steroids
with
superb
taste
and
unique
smells
recommended
for
a
hop
head
or
a
red
head
lover
overall
a
good
hoppy
beer
though
i
personally
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
red
ale
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
especially
if
you
enjoy
a
nice
hoppygrainy
ale
definitely
will
get
again
overall
this
one
is
an
experience
to
the
palate
on
the
one
hand
you
have
that
great
hop
presence
with
the
resiny
pine
flavours
and
hops
and
on
the
other
hand
it
finishes
with
that
great
sweet
caramel
flavour
that
is
just
not
found
in
a
lot
of
other
red
ales
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
at
least
a
6
of
this
because
it
is
well
worth
it
over
and
above
my
expectations
would
and
definitely
will
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
have
the
chance
o
a
very
fine
red
ale
that
does
a
great
job
balancing
the
heavy
sweet
malt
profile
with
some
aggressive
hopping
fairly
easy
to
drink
at
only
6
8
too
opinion
overall
i
am
really
happy
with
this
one
it
has
lots
of
flavor
and
a
balanced
profile
with
plenty
of
carbonation
there
is
nothing
that
hits
the
palate
like
it
shouldnt
be
there
so
overall
i
would
give
this
beer
a
solid
thumbs
up
o
i
believe
this
is
the
first
bear
republic
offering
i
havent
been
impressed
with
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
due
to
the
malt
forward
smell
and
taste
but
worth
trying
i
would
drink
it
again
i
appreciate
bear
republic
but
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
there
are
too
many
better
examples
of
a
red
ale
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
definitely
above
average
its
bitterness
is
something
to
be
challenged
even
by
imperial
brews
a
little
sour
for
my
liking
but
not
repulsively
so
a
great
looking
beer
with
an
incredible
aroma
a
tasty
and
delicious
red
ale
very
satisfying
and
highly
drinkable
nothing
is
overdone
and
the
interaction
between
hops
and
malt
is
uncomplicated
while
at
the
same
time
distinctive
good
stuff
pours
out
a
deep
dark
red
almost
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
foam
quickly
dissipates
not
what
i
would
expect
from

sure
what
they
mean
by
bastardized
scottish
red
ale
i
suspect
its
the
hops
its
just
potent
enough
and
is
absolutely
delicious
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
which
effervesces
on
your
tongue
and
throat

it
goes

the
best
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
that
is
appropriate
for
the
style
and
i
am
not
suggesting
this
is
an
overly
malty
beer
still
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
i
have
tried
another

offering

as

earlier
earthy
moreys
bottom
line
an
impressive
offering
from
an
unfamiliar
brewery
not
my
favorite
style
but
quite
obviously
a
well
made
brewski
pours
a
brilliant
deep
ruby
color
that
is
crystal
clear
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
remains
atop
the
glass
and
leaves
nice
lacing
as
you
sip
the
aroma
has
a
resinous
piney
hop
aroma
with
some
bready
toasted
malts
to
follow
it
up
the
flavor
has
more
hop
flavor
upfront
with
some
dried
fruits
and
ends
up
sweet
and
with
a
lingering
citrus
bitterness
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
slightly
sticky
im
really
glad
the
flavor
came
through
for
this
one
because
the
aroma
was
just
a
little
boring
tasty
malt
beverage
the
taste
follows
the
nose
although
there
is
less
oily
hop
than
one
might
have
expected
but
plenty
of
thick
bittering
leafy
hop
a
slightly
syrupy
chicory
red
malty
ale
some
abv
throaty
burn
lots
of
residual
hop
oil
on
the
tongue
and
an
aftertaste
of
a
slightly
charred
and
smoky
malt
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
entirely
suited
to
my
tastes
it
does
make
a
statement
and
the
palate
of
flavors
is
quite
full
d
very
good
easy
to
quaff
dispite
the
size
another
impressive
beer
from
bear
republic
i
look
forward
to
seeing
more
of
their
brews
in
colorado
soon
keep

brown
with
a
nice
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
nice
blend
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet

with
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
pine
hops
and
caramel
malts
that
both
linger
nicely
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
this
one
is
certainly
enjoyable
but
not
as
good
as
its
hoppy
brothers
racer
5
and
hop
rod
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
not
thick
or
heavy
to
me
but
substantial
this
is
not
really
a
to
style
beer
for
any
style
bt
a
great
beer
nonetheless
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
dont
want
to
pair
with
food
but
just
enjoy
it
by
itself
very
impressed
for
my
first
beer
from
bear
republic
this
one
ranks
number
two
in
its
class
i
believe
i
would
agree
with
that
but
this
just
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer

its

flavor
is
pretty
good
i
think
there
are
hops
but
they
seem
to
be
layered
under
a
chewy
maltiness
overall
this
was
a
good
buy
and
a
good
value
red

ale
it

to
be

theres
nothing
cheery
or

about
it
there
is
no

that

a
fantastic

ale
if
you
dig
this
style
by
all
means
seek
this
one
out
d
ill
have
to
get
this
one
again
drinkability
is
above
average
for
this
one
despite
the
higher
alcohol
content
great
session
brew
in
my
opinion
i
am
truly
impressed
by
this
brew
i
am
quite
surprised
at
how
fast
i
am
going
through
this
22oz
bottle
of
frothy
goodness
its
really
amazing
how
much
more
character
this
version
of
the
american
amber
offers
versus
some
of
its
counterparts
a
great
beer
for
fans
of
the
style
i
traditionally
think
of
american
ambers
as
a
you
know
what
youre
getting
type
of
beer
this
one
through
me
off
in
a
good
way
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
some
flavor
complexity
and
a
lot
of
substance
that
makes
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
i
would
love
to
do
a
blind
tasting
of
ambers
with
this
beer
in
the
mix
i
know
nugget
nectar
is
the
godbeer
in
that
category
but
red
rocket
and
hop
head
red
could
easily
top
it
in
my
book
im
curious
as
to
which
would
come
out
on
top
overall
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
and
had
no
idea
the
marks
would
be
so
high
for
myself
as
well
as
for
other
reviewers
looovvveee
it
d
nicely
balanced
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
i
would
definitely
buy
a
six
pack
if
i
was
hanging
out
with
friends
a
darn
good
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
still
78
times
out
of
10
im
picking
up
hop
rod
over
this
heres
to
variety
d
this
is
a
big
hearty
beer
it
has
tons
of
flavor
and
at
6
8
abv
it
packs
a
nice
punch
as
well
this
is
very
drinkable
as
the
flavors
are
complex
but
balanced
the
carbonation
is
just
right
for
a
beer
this
big
i
cant
see
having
this
as
a
session
ale
but
it
was
an
excellent
single
bomber
indulgence
will
most
likely
enjoy
this
with
a
meal
next
time
well
recommended
notes
this
is
such
a
very
drinkable
beer
massivly
smooth
such
a
remarkable
year
round
brew
cheers
this
is
a
solid
amber
balanced
well
and
easy
to
take
down
the
abv
is
up
there
but
its
well
hidden
red
ales
are
not
usually
my
beer
of
choice
but
i
loved
the
other
bear
republic
brews
that
i
tried
so
i
picked
one
of
these
up
at
bauers
in
boston
as
soon
as
i
got
home
i
poured
the
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
poured
a
very
dark
brownish
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
hold
it
up
to
the
light
and
the
glass
reflects
a
brilliant
dark
red
color
this
beer
has
a
very
malty
scent
with
hints
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
similar
to
an
ipa
but
much
more
dark
and
with
a
much
drier
finish
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dry
grapefruit
bitter
taste
this
is
not
my
favorite
bear
republic
brew
but
is
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
i
will
buy
this
again
however
it
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
as
far
as
drinkability
dont
bank
on
having
this
as
a
session
beer
my
session
beer
preference
has
to
include
somewhat
of
a
refreshing
aftertaste
and
this
doesnt
exactly
fit
that
criteria
this
would
be
great
with
dinner
especially
with
red
meat
perhaps
a
fat
steak
since
its
6

a
couple
with

its
too
hoppy
for
me
but
it
may
be
perfect
for
someone
else
you
need
to
pour
it
rather
aggressively
to
achieve
a
good
head
if
too
slow
the
head
is
slim

none
however
when
its
there
its
thick
and
bubbly
it
disappears
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
only
some
lacing
but
still
enough
to
enjoy
there
are
a
lot
of
worldclass
micro
breweries
in
the
state
of
california
so
its
easy
to
see
how
bear
republic
can
get
overlooked
that
said
there
is
no
reason
they
ever
should
be
this
brewery
offers
a
lineup
as
solid
as
any
other
within
the
state
or
even
the
country
for
that
matter
bear
republic
makes
only
one
kind
of
beer
great
ones
the
aroma
has
tea
prunes

the
palate
is

this
is

would

to
have
another
one
quite
tasty
beer
too

but
without

its
just
a
workout
to
finish
the

good
for
a
couple
of
glasses
but
its
a
bit
too
rich
in
malts
for
my
likes
overall
a
fantastic
american
amber
beer
the
flavors
arent
particularly
strong
or
overpowering
but
everything
fits
together
into
a
very
smooth
light
beer
that
is
great
anytime
of
the
year
from
summer
through
winter
highly
recommended
d
this
is
an
exercise
in
proper
serving
temperature
drinkability
and
smell
increased
significantly
with
warming
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
session
ale
all
the
way
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
red
ale
interesting
balance
of
burnt
toasty
malts
dark
fruits
bitter
hops
d
a
overall
and
all
around
good
beer
if
just
a
little
ugly
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
this
beer
straight
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
as
im
sure
it
would
be
out
of
this
world
this
one
seems
to
have
lost
a
touch
in
the
ways
of
hopiness
for
this
bottle
at
least
taste
has
a
very
nice
blend
of
hop
which
is
not
overpowering
and
a
silky
smooth
malt
mouthfeel
is
full
and
slighly
chewy
just
like
the
other
bear
republic
beers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
deliciuos
brew
pours
a
deep
slightly
cloudy
rubyred
copperish
color
w
a
very
thick
frothy
white
tinged
with
yellow
head
that
stands
a
full
1
or
so
above
my
goblet
and
never
really
settles
before
completly
coating
it
with
a
thick
lace
a
strong
piney
hop
aroma
with
some
faint
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
phenols
taste
is
also
predominated
by
citrusy
hop
flavor
a
strong
initial
hop
bite
that
is
balanced
by
only
slightly
by
a
rich
bready
toasty
malt
base
w
a
faint
butterycaramel
undertone
a
medfull
body
made
creamier
by
the
abundant
co2
levels
a
damn
fine
red
ale
very
drinkable
once
you
get
past
the
gargantuan
everlasting
head
this
could
easily
be
my
summer
goto
beer
i
am
impressed
the
hops
is
inyourface
but
as
you
drink
its
nicely
albeit
subtly
matched
with
the
malts
at
6
8
you
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
be
rockin
for
the
night
d
i
love
this
it
is
simply
delicious
and
ill
drink
it
any
time
of
year
pours
a
dark
brown
reddish
color
dark
white
head
average
diminishing
very
pine
hoppy
aroma
some
alcohol
sweet
slight
grapefruity
smell
sweet
taste
slightly
syrupy
taste
of
pine
slightly
heavy
body
bubbly
good
mouthfeel
okay
overall
a
good
beer
i
will
definetly
drink
again
at
some
point
very
drinkable
probably
just
behind
evil
dead
red
on
my
best
west
coast
red
list
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
i
thought
the
beer
looked
really
great
at
first
with
a
nice
black
color
and
fine
bubbles
in
the
head
the
taste
was
hoppy
with
a
taste
of
caramel
involved
the
smelll
was
hoppy
just
like
the
taste
i
would
most
likely
try
this
one
again
though
a
little
hoppy
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
almost
reddish
color
with
a
big
bubbly
head
over
it
which
left
lacing
on
the
glass
only
toward
the
end
a
mixture
of
sweet
malt
fresh
grass
and
citrus
hops
compose
the
aroma
bitter
through
and
through
on
the
palate
initially
a
sweet
maltiness
provides
some
balances
but
it
never
breaks
through
completely
by
the
time
the
beer
smoothly
glides
toward
the
back
the
bitterness
has
grown
and
finishes
with
a
tad
of
resinous
pine
overall
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
amber
ales
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
quaffing
picked
up
a
single
at
the
party
source
in
syracuse
for
a
couple
bucks
whoa
big
head
here
after
it
settles
down
the
caramel
aroma
was
a
bit
rubbery
possibly
old
the
flavor
has
a
dry
caramel
sticky
bun
malt
profile
with
a
big
punch
of
grapefruit
and
orange
rind
hops
the
dry
malts
and
big
american
hops
make
a
satisfying
yet
drinkable
beer
i
want
more
overall
i
honestly
dont
understand
what
people
see
in
this
beer
i
know
its
supposedly
the
first
of
its
kind
but
to
me
its
far
too
onedimensional
my
favorite
beer
style
is
altbier
so
its
not
that
i
cant
appreciate
a
good
bracingly
bitter
beer
its
just
that
a
good
bracingly
bitter
beer
needs
something
else
to
balance
it
out
and
im
not
finding
it
here
i
have
a
feeling
id
love
double
red
rocket
but
as
it
is
this
beer
simply
seems
unfinished
now
a
little
about
myself
i
grew
up
in
healdsburg
and
have
been
drinking
this
stuff
since
i
was
16
years
old
yeah
im
a
little
biased
id
drink
these
for
sure
its
a
drinkable
red
although
its
more
of
a
bitter
ipa
i
do
like
and
will
but
it
again
it
will
be
a
spot
buy
though
d
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
bracing
bitterness
which
hides
almost
all
of
the
other
flavors
that
might
be
lurking
beneath
it
notes
another
terrific
offering
from
bear
republic
the
best
american
amber
that
ive
had
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
great
but
its
just
not
one
that
i
could
drink
all
night
but
for
an
every
once
in
a
while
thing
its
great
highly
recommended
dthis
is
a
real
treat
drinkable
hell
yes
maybe
one
of
the
best
all
around
balanced
american
ambers
i
have
ever
had
i
am
aghast
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
to
this
one
as
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
racer
5
for
a
hops
fix
passing
this
by
on
the
shelf
i
just
figured
this
was
another
hophead
beer
but
not
so
not
to
malty
not
too
hoppy
just
right
for
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
balance
big
taste
without
the
big
abv
what
more
can
i
say
a
great
find
and
one
that
i
am
going
back
for
alot
md
medium
to
full
bodied
very
smooth
almost
silky
nice
drinkablity
relatively
low
alcohol
and
really
nothing
to
complain
about
very

drinkability
not
an
everyday
beer
this
one
fits
a
specifc
bill
when
wanting
a
surprising
british
style
red
with
a
unique
hop
backbone
this
one
is
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
big
ass
wee
heavy
and
a
hoppy
american
amberred
color
is
right
between
the
twosomewhere
between

nice
light

slightly
hazy
big

of

dark
dried
fruit
and
grapefruity
and
resiny
american
hops
taste
follows
suit
with
surprisingly
rich
sweet
malts
and
big
smooth
hop
bitterness
almost
full
bodied
with
a
long
drying
finish
from
the
hops
generous
hopping
unfortunately
leaves
more
slickness
than
id
like
and
the
hops
also
cause
this
to
be
a
bit
of
a
palatebuster
however
if
you
had
to
stick
with
a
single
beer
for
an
entire
evening
you
could
do
much
much
worse
than
this
hops
seem
a
bit
tame
and
faded
further
convincing
me
this
is
not
the
freshest
example
still
its
fullflavored
and
very
tasty
will
eagerly
try
another
bottle
some
day
d
this
beer
was
more
complex
than
i
expected
out
of
an
amber
ale
style
but
bear
republic
again
delivered
a
great
beer
thick
and
rich
and
goes
down
smooth
the
taste
which
gets
better
as
it
warms
is
a
complex
blend
of
caramelamber
malts
and
piney
hop
resin
the
malt
notes
unfold
slowly
revealing
brown
sugar
and
sweetbread
while
the
hops
come
on
strong
at
the
finish
with
lots
of
restrained
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
pepper
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
with
a
semicreamyspicy
consistency
and
a
nearperfect
carbonation
level
drinkability
is
topnotch
too
as
i
could
eagerly
go
through
another
bomber
of
this
stuff
without
batting
an
eyelash
bear
republic
rarely
disappoints
and
red
rocket
is
no
exception
the
beer
poured
a
deep
red
brownish
color
with
a
billowing
head
that
left
lacing
all
the
way
down
my
pint
glass
as
i
drank
this
excellent
offering
the
first
smell
i
got
was
of
those
pineygrapefruit
hops
it
was
surprisingly
sweet
with
a
bitter
finish
that
lingered
that
told
me
to
have
another
big
sip
red
rocket
was
definitely
a
hoppier
beer
than
i
expected
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
i
liked
it
as
much
as
i
did
being
that
im
not
a
huge
hophead
the
beer
had
a
nice
crispness
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
beer
that
definitely
can
knock
you
on
your
butt

you
dont
pay

moderate

bitterness
with
citrus

pine

one

the
most

bigger

this

a

is
inviting
with

plenty

starts
sweet

malty
and
moves
to
a
hoppy
flavor
quickly
it
finishes
sweet

the
sweet

the
bitter
and
wins
out
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
smooth
beer
with
a
medium

that
has
a
nice
flavor

the
sweet
isnt
overpowering

the
higher

isnt
noticeable
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
could
see
it
getting
annoying
after
a
few
but
the
flavor
is
distinct
and
delicious
a
great

worth
checking
out
the
drink
is
juicy

succulent

a
clear
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
as
it
settled
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
toasted

with
hints

a

the
taste
has

up

i
am
not

fan
of

between
this
and

they
do
the

doesnt

with
an
underbelly
of
malts
and
some
honeynutty
flavors
i
can
easily
say
this

my
favorites
this
was
a
drain
pour
why
all
the
hype

this
is
just
not

ive
ever

is

and
lots
of

smell
is

lots

add

red

is
one
of
my
new
favs
this
beer
is
almost
perfect
unfortunate
about
the
name
though
ill
be
back
not
bad
notmy
first
choice
though
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
a
good
hop
blend
and
nice
malt
with
a
little
roasted
flavor
in
the
background
the
beer
is
rather
thick
feeling
and
easy
to
drink
very
well
done
taste
had
a
huge
chocolate
caramel
malt
taste
slightly
roasted
aggressive
hops
arent
really
there
mostly
just
a
hoppy
aftertaste
nice
well
balanced
mouthfeel
slightly
dissapointed
with
this
beer
maybe
i
have
too
high
expectations
for
anything
with
bear
republic
on
the
label
wow
this
is
a
delicious
beer
d
a
real
good
rather
easy
drinking
amber
ale
very
enjoyable
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
wasnt
a
bit
disappointed
though
racer
5
and
hop
rod
set
a
pretty
high
standard
still
another
solid
bear
republic
offering
ill
be
looking
forward
to
trying
the
stout
yet
interesting
flavors
and
to
me
it
really
wasnt
to
sessionable
overall
not
my
favorite
from
bear
republic
even
though
red
ales
arent
my
favorite
style
this
beer
really
impressed
me
drinkability
is
fairly
high
its
a
solid
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
see
taste
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
new
beers
the
sad
thing
is
i
found
it
in
a
specialty
grocery
store
and
this
was
the
last
6
pack
bummer
d
supremely
drinkable
the
alcohol
gets
you
a
nice
buzz
but
nothing
outrageous
flavors
are
very
nice
and
well
balanced
this
would
be
good
any
time
of
the
year
i
guess
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
less
bubbly
but
i
dont
think
it
really
detracts
from
the
beer
one
of
the
best
in
this
style
that
ive
had
pors
a
deep
amber
color
and
has
two
or
so
fingers
of
head
it
smells
of
citrus
and
hops
there
is
a
bitter
hop
taste
and
also
a
strange
sweetness
to
it
about
halfway
through
the
taste
it
sort
of
reminded
me
of
the
sweetness
in
a
pink
lemonade
weird
the
bite
of
the
hops
linger
for
a
good
while
though
its
a
pretty
light
body
and
pretty
drinkable
a
little
odd
though
overall
this
is
a
medium
bodied
very
hoppy
and
flavorful
red
ale
bear
republic
does
not
disappoint
smoother
and
more
flavourful
than
most
of
the
ambers
ive
had
if
you
dont
like
fat
tire
or
american
ale
maybe
you
should
give
this
one
a
shot
before
giving
up
on
the
ambers
overall
my
opinion
was
that
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
mean
it
was
an
ok
brew
but
thought
it
would
be
much
better
and
it
didnt
live
to
my
expectations
a
big
red
ale
and
nice
tasting
the
heavier
body
and
high
abv
limits
drinkability
this
beer
executes
on
all
phases
one
kick
ass
brew
here
i
will
be
hording
some
more
on
my
next
trip
to
the
store
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
i
have
had
other
amber
ales

this
beer
is
more
on
the
lines
of
troegs
hopback
amber
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
red
rocket
looked
great
in
the
glass
a
really
cool
amber
red
color
i
didnt
pick
up
much
in
the
smell
it
had
a
somewhat
hoppy
taste
but
the
hops
werent
too
overpowering
i
liked
this
one
but
wasnt
crazy
about
it
which
is
likely
due
more
to
me
not
enjoying
the
style
than
to
the
beer
itself
d
strong
for
a
sub
7
abv
ale
with
a
very
present
alcohol
taste
that
being
said
its
very
enjoyable
to
actually
drink
something
a
lot
of
strong
amber
ales
just
dont
quite
manage
the
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
strong
hops
and
malts
make
this
a
red
ale
excellent
definitely
worth
experiencing
poura
a
deep
reddish
brown
topped
by
a
14
offwhite
head
carbonation
is
lively
smell
is
of
hops
dense
caramel
malts
taste
is
fairly
deep
as
well
more
malts
dominated
by
piney
hops
just
keep
coming
also
tastes
like
there
might
be
some
rye
malts
in
there
too
very
nice
mouthfeel
somewhat
silky
a
very
enjoyable
red
ale
as
they
seem
to
be
few
and
far
between
bottle
artwork
simple
crayon
inspired
red
rocket
and
font
on
a
cream
colored
centerpiece
on
an
otherwise
black
label
a
tad
too
much
bitterness
for
my
taste
still
a
quality
red
ale
and
one
to
look
for
d
i
finished
the
bomber
without
a
problem
and
look
forward
to
having
some
more
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
this
beer
looks
almost
red
rust
red
wine
and
some
koolaid
very
spongey
airey
head
right
ater
the
pour
but
the
dissipaton
is
swift
before
i
even
take
a
sip
the
aroma
is
like
pouring
hop
syrup
over
a
just
opened
bag
of
rice
white
bread
and
fresh
crushed
mint
mint
and
orange
peel
hit
the
palate
first
they
hang
on
tight
throughout
th
whole
sip
while
herbal
tobacco
and
biscuit
notes
meld
with
the
hop
resins
palate
is
chewy
an
has
a
long
slow
lingering
bitterness
pleasantly
bitter
red
ale
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
d
good
really
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
6
abv
pours
an
opaque
reddishbrown
color
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
a
generous
lace
with
each
sip
the
big
aroma
here
is
a
bold
floral
hop
with
sweet
malt
and
maybe
even
a
bit
of
apple
as
well
upon
first
taste
the
bold
hop
profile
was
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
with
buttery
and
caramel
malt
flavors
in
the
background
and
a
slight
warming
alcohol
presence
at
the
finish
this
one
is
a
bit
heavy
and
sticky
on
the
palate
but
finishes
easier
then
one
might
think
not
something
youd
want
to
pound
a
6er
of
in
one
sitting
but
a
damn
fine
brew
in
its
own
right
this
one
can
stand
toetotoe
with
arrogant
bastard
any
day
in
my
book
pours
out
a
highly
carbonated
red
brew
with
2
finger
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
smells
mildly
hopped
taste
of
sweet
malt
and
fairly
hopped
up
i
was
surprised
about
the
hop
content
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
will
definitely
buy
again
a
dark
deep
ruby
red
color
almost
a
brown
color
a
small
light
brown
head
forms
on
top
dissolving
away
to
a
film
a
strong
malty
fragrance
with
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
that
is
followed
by
a
light
grassy
scent
blending
to
a
mild
citric
aroma
the
end
a
rich
malty
caramel
sweetness
at
the
front
of
each
taste
then
a
grassy
tobacco
flavor
follows
it
then
blends
to
grapefruit
bitterness
at
the
end
a
full
to
medium
bodied
feel
a
rich
to
smooth
feel
slightly
slick
midway
it
leaves
subtle
dry
finish
at
the
back
of
the
palate
his
is
a
very
good
to
great
tasting
beer
this
is
a
solid
beer
all
the
way
through
pours
a
ruby
red
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
inch
or
so
of
off
white
head
smell
is
caramel
malt
and
some
hops
taste
shows
more
of
the
hops
but
there
is
enough
malt
to
balance
it
out
im
also
getting
a
bit
of
spice
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
bittering
and
noncloying
on
the
tongue
appearance
is
a
dark
raisny
plum
color
with
a
nice
thick
frothy
tan
head
nice
sticky
lacing
and
theres
always
a
decent
head
lying
on
the
beer
aroma
is
of
sweet
hops
balanced
with
a
nutty
malt
flavor
theres
a
very
strong
deep
nutty
malt
aroma
here
that
id
expect
from
a
belgian
or
a
complex
sweet
stout
which
i
really
enjoy
taste
predominantly
comes
from
the
bittering
hops
at
first
a
bit
overwhelming
im
not
a
hophead
but
it
goes
well
with
the
light
rum
and
bready
tones
of
the
malt
also
a
very
strong
hop
aftertaste
both
from
the
bittering
and
flavoring
hops
with
a
slight
dried
prune
taste
id
say
that
the
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
smooth
up
front
and
in
the
back
with
a
nice
peak
in
acidity
from
the
carbonation
and
hops
in
the
middle
id
say
this
might
be
a
little
more
drinkable
on
draft
and
it
gets
more
malty
and
bready
as
it
gets
warmer
overall
very
nice
md
full
bodied
and
very
creamy
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
a
little
bight
very
drinkable
d
i
usually
do
not
like
opening
bombers
by
myself
i
like
sharing
them
with
friends
i
am
very
glad
no
one
is
around
on
this
one
its
all
mine
i
love
this
beer
too
bad
i
cannot
get
bear
republic
in
ga
yet
hopefully
it
will
come
here
someday
soon
drinkability
one
of
the
better
ambers
out
there
this
ones
darker
than
usual
which
makes
for
an
interesting
drink
abv
is
of
course
manageable
and
well
hidden
a
very
wellmade
drinkable
tasty
big
red
recommended
d
one
or
two
pints
is
very
nice
very
rich
satisfying
beer
decent
but
too
much
hops
for
me
a
tasty
hoppy
version
of
the
venerable
redamber
ale
i
like
this
style
when
its
got
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
so
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
drinkability
nice
d
i
love
the
hoppy
reds
you
get
the
best
of
both
world
hops
and
sweet
malt
that
come
together
to
make
one
fine
beer
worth
trying
this
beer
was
picked
up
at
greens
in
greenville
south
carolina
recently
and
the
pour
looked
a
lovely
shade
of
burgundy
and
was
capped
by
a
dense
but
smallish
head
the
smell
was
citric
hoppy
with
undertones
of
red
apples
the
taste
was
tart
bitter
slightly
peaty
and
very
hearty
the
flavors
were
strong
but
beautifully
complimentary
and
it
was
hard
to
put
it
down
for
typing
this
review
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
soft
and
the
aftertaste
showcased
the
flavors
ina
slow
fade
a
beautifully
crafted
symphony
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
experience
while
is
lasted
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
my
first
bear
republic
tasting
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
a
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
it
will
defiantly
work
its
a
very
nice
dark
copper
body
with
lots
of
red
hues
the
head
is
a
large
dirty
tan
rocky
lace
monster
that
does
a
great
job
leaving
loads
of
art
work
on
the
glass
smell
is
piney
and
citrus
hops
in
a
carmal
malt
bomb
also
get
some
light
floral
and
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
a
good
bitter
hop
hit
up
front
riding
a
very
forward
carmaltoasted
malt
flavor
with
some
nice
pine
and
rind
flavors
coming
through
this
one
is
more
full
bodied
than
medium
and
realy
has
a
luxurious
feel
to
its
slightly
chuncky
body
its
a
big
beer
but
drinkable
however
22oz
in
one
sitting
is
plenty
for
me
at
least
overall
another
very
very
good
beer
from
bear
republic
taste
and
smell
was
dominated
by
malt
but
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
hops
overall
a
good
beer
with
good
drinkability
could
have
another
any
day
overall
bear
republic
red
rocket
ale
is
another
solid
brew
from
bear
republic
that
is
worth
a
shot
drinkability
i
held
off
tasting
this
beer
as
i
never
get
very
excited
by
ambers
in
this
case
i
was
mistaken
pours
a
deep
clear
copper
red
with
huge
dark
beige
head
that
lasts
smells
of
biscuity
malt
and
generous
amounts
of
c
hops
light
hints
of
coffee
plenty
of
sweet
roasty
malt
in
the
taste
juxtaposed
by
quite
a
bit
of
resinous
hop
bitterness
the
sweetbitter
thing
works
better
here
than
in
many
other
west
coast
brews
but
they
still
dont
really
balance
each
other
as
intendedits
just
quite
sweet
and
quite
bitter
at
the
same
time
very
slight
warming
alcohol
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
though
its
not
exactly
refined
the
smell
was
of
deep
roasted
malt
with
caramel
and
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
was
malty
smooth
and
brown
sugar
like
it
left
a
good
hop
linger
in
the
mouth
and
was
semi
chewy
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
great
ale
and
would
buy
again
overall
im
a
borderline
beer
add
case
though
so
i
get
bored
of
flavours
easily
a
bomber
is
enough
then
id
move
on
to
the
racer
5
to
finish
off
the
day
single
bottle
from
whole
foods
reston
i
cant
believe
im
love
an
amberred
so
much
consistantly
my
least
favorite
style
but
this
is
amazing
first
of
all
this
may
be
the
best
looking
beer
ive
ever
seen
the
color
is
a
rich
dark
hazy
amber
thick
rocky
mocha
colored
head
that
settles
into
this
amazing
creamy
head
with
great
retention
and
awesome
lacing
after
it
settles
it
practically
looks
like
its
been
on
nitrotap
i
swear
smell
is
rich
of
malt
caramel
and
hops
taste
is
great
a
nice
strong
malty
backbone
but
not
to
be
outdone
by
the
hops
nice
bitter
west
coast
hops
in
a
way
it
almost
reminds
me
of
an
english
ipa
like
drakes
ipa
but
thats
a
good
thing
mouthfeel
is
perfect
it
is
light
and
easy
drinking
yet
there
is
a
creamy
texture
to
it
that
feels
so
smooth
going
down
overall
a
great
beer
again
i
cant
believe
this
is
an
amber
but
it
may
have
reignited
my
interest
in
this
style
d
an
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
i
loved
how
hoppy
this
one
comes
off
as
id
like
to
have
this
again
sometime
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
2
fingered
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
light
but
nice
a
mixture
between
nuts
and
malts
this
beers
taste
has
a
wonderful
mixture
of
malts
and
hops
a
very
smooth
beer
the
malts
in
the
beer
are
top
notch
the
mouthfeel
as
stated
is
incredibly
smooth
almost
silky
my
only
complaint
would
be
a
slight
dry
feeling
after
i
swallow
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
not
for
the
slight
afterfeel
it
would
be
a
all
nighter
well
done
d
well
well
well
bear
republic
two
for
two
and
they
are
a
bit
different
than
others
so
yes
id
get
again
d
very
nice
brew
i
could
have
a
couple
of
bombers
but
that
would
probably
do
me
in
a
great
session
beer
could
definately
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
nice
red
ale
with
bold
hop
flavor
and
aroma
while
still
keeping
things
malty
and
complex
ill
be
buying
more
one
of
the
finer
ambers
that
are
out
there
and
what
makes
it
sweeter
is
that
im
reviewing
this
as
i
sit
at
my
resurrected
computer
d
very
good
the
bomber
is
a
perfect
serving
to
share
with
a
friend
or
hog
to
yourself
d
a
very
good
beer
a
nicy
hoppy
brew
that
isnt
overly
bitter
not
sure
if
its
a
session
beer
but
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
easy
drinking
great
with
the
meal
of
freshcaught
fish
we
enjoyed
with
this
bomber
didnt
hit
the
style
for
me
falling
in
the
cracks
someplace
but
damn
tasty
id
take
this
baby
out
to
dinner
any
day
of
the
week
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
citrusy
grapefruity
hop
in
the
taste
grapefruity
hops
in
a
dry
end
a
small
bitterness
and
a
medium
to
big
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
citrus
hop
aftertaste
a
nice
hop
presence
and
a
bigger
body
almost
feels
like
an
ipa
to
put
it
roughly
it
comes
across
like
a
crash
of
an
ipa
and
a
scotch
ale
and
it
works
in
spades
d
a
great
red
ale
with
an
edge
that
screams
highquality
i
would
welcome
a
little
more
sweetness
and
a
little
less
hoppiness
ala
samuel
adams
irish
red
ale
but
all
in
all
this
is
an
excellent
beer
d
oh
my
i
love
this
beer
highly
recommended
the
drinkability
is
excellent
tasty
brew
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
and
large
soapy
bubbles
a
touch
dark
for
style
but
otherwise
an
attractive
beer
aromas
off
this
beer
are
dominated
by
hops
lots
of
piney
chinook
and
citrusy
cascades
following
are
notes
of
caramel
toasted
bread
and
some
diacetyl
on
the
palate
this
is
a
substantial
amber
with
lots
of
hop
flavor
not
exceptionally
fresh
malt
depth
and
plenty
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
medium
body
medium
high
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
almost
a
bit
hot
as
its
a
very
dry
beer
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
in
the
malt
department
the
taste
is
amazing
stewed
apples
and
a
light
fig
flavor
with
very
god
carbonation
that
wakes
your
palate
up
from
the
dead
this
amber
ale
has
so
much
going
on
it
almost
taste
like
a
scottish
ale
that
bert
grant
use
to
make
another
great
beer
from
bear
republic
im
glad
you
can
get
this
ale
in
six
packs
here
drinkability
clocks
in
at
6
8
so
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
single
bottle
but
is
fairly
drinkable
i
fear
my
bottle
has
lost
a
bit
of
its
intended
hop
flavor
as
evidenced
by
the
perceived
oxidation
so
i
suspect
other
reviews
may
have
gotten
a
fresher
bottle
despite
the
bottle
issues
its
still
a
good
beer
if
you
enjoy
high
alcohol
bitter
reds
d
super
really
hoppy
red
with
an
excellent
maltiness
holding
everything
together
great
mouthfeel
would
definitely
have
another
one
and
look
forward
to
finishing
the
bottle
it
seems
like
bear
republic
can
do
no
wrong
red
rocket
in
the
blue
red
grey
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
this
was
my
second
offering
from
bear
republic
1st
was
racer
5
which
rocks
and
i
was
really
impressed
i
would
buy
this
all
the
time
if
it
was
available
in
ri
each
taste
seemed
multilayered
and
complex
i
will
soon
have
to
pick
up
the
bomber
that
this
comes
in
to
compare
between
the
tapped
version
i
had
and
also
just
to
get
more
of
this
awesome
beer
red
rocket
takes
off
into
the
glass
with
explosive
carbonation
and
portrays
a
garnet
color
and
tan
cushiony
foam
leaving
plenty
lacing
aroma
initially
opens
with
sweet
hops
then
settles
down
with
some
fruit
burnt
sugars
and
roasted
malt
wonderful
flavors
of
balanced
hops
brown
sugar
and
roasted
malt
no
other
red
ale
exemplifies
the
style
so
well
while
incorporating
hops
into
every
interaction
in
the
brew
to
the
bitter
end
love
it
another
amazing
beer
from
bear
republic
also
try
their
hop
rod
rye
overall
very
drinkable
delicious
coming
in
for
a
beer
plays
nice
with
the
tastebuds
slightly
creamy
and
very
drinkable
fits
nicly
with
the
rest
of
the
br
offerings
if
i
wasnt
so
buzzed
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
another
d
i
could
deffinitely
drink
this
beer
all
night
well
maybe
since
it

abv
wither
way
if
you
in
the
mood
for
a
english
or
scottish
ale
with
a
hint
of
ipa
this
is
the
ticket
an
excellent
offering
from
an
excellent
brewery
d
a
very
drinkable
red
ale
i
really
enjoy
the
overall
quality
of
this
brew
both
the
malt
and
hop
aspects
are
both
topnotch
yet
still
balanced
together
enough
as
to
be
enjoyable
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
especially
considering
the
other
br
offerings
id
tried
previously
nothing
about
the
red
rocket
was
bad
yet
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
as
being
great
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
for
its
type
but
nothing
more
special
thanks
to
flyfisher2782
for
the
bottle
another
damn
good
bear
republic
beer
im
loving
this
brewery
more
and
more
d
very
drinkable
maltleaning
ale
lots
of
flavour
and
sweetness
in
this
might
get
cloying
after
a
while
though
plenty
of
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
plus
something
very
pleasing
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
lean
towards
the
malt
until
the
brew
slides
down
the
throat
which
is
when
the
hops
really
make
themselves
felt
very
pleasant
a
little
undercarbonated
i
think
which
detracts
a
bit
from
the
body
and
mouthfeel
but
thats
a
very
small
quibble
in
this
instance
all
in
all
a
particularly
good
beer
that
id
buy
again
no
question
poured
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
piney
floral
hops
on
the
nose
with
mild
malts
slight
hint
of
smoke
head
is
slow
to
reside
lacing
splotches
on
glass
and
stays
in
place
getting
some
smokey
malts
on
the
palette
with
some
mild
hops
on
the
finish
low
carbonation
on
this
one
thinking
it
could
use
some
more
milky
finish
on
this
one
too
good
brew
expected
it
to
be
red
drinkabilitystaggers
along
the
line
between
session
and
what
was
i
thinking
cheap
and
easy
just
like
me
d
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
but
the
hop
bitterness
and
heavy
body
would
keep
me
from
drinking
too
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
another
super
good
beer
from
bear
republic
my
local
brew
store
just
started
getting
these
in
so
theyre
all
new
and
i
dig
em
i
cant
think
of
a
beer
drinker
that
wouldnt
enjoy
this
one
cheers
one
of
the
few
amber
ales
done
right
the
approach
is
that
of
a
serious
ipa
but
with
the
malt
profile
found
in
irish
reds
it
turns
out
beautiful
a
dark
mohogany
look
with
a
shy
creamy
tan
head
formation
retention
and
lacing
aromas
are
a
blend
of
sorgum
barley
with
a
sharp
blend
of
pine
citrus
and
herbs
very
clean
from
the
apprearance
through
the
flavors
and
aromas
and
on
into
the
textures
bready
as
if
done
via
decoction
mash
but
softly
sweetened
by
barley
syrups
and
candied
fruits
equally
soft
in
the
texture
though
not
a
cask
ale
the
beer
exhibits
the
constant
soft
carbonation
and
creamy
mouthfeel
better
than
most
from
the
bottle
a
light
mint
joins
the
frey
in
the
finish
along
with
a
long
lingering
pine
confectionate
blend
very
nice
amber
pale
even
if
a
little
biteey
in
the
end
md
light
carbonation
nothing
too
unsettling
big
hops
and
big
beers
thats
the
b
r
way
thanks
for
another
nailed
style
good
beer
overall
on
the
lighter
side
for
an
american
strong
ale
nice
once
it
cools
down
after
a
hot
day
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
nice
beer
pours
hazy
brown
with
a
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
very
slightly
hot
and
richly
malty
with
some
citrusy
hops
as
well
tastes
great
deep
flavors
of
malt
without
being
too
sweet
lots
more
citrusy
hops
and
a
tiny
bit
coppery
very
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
with
a
nice
little
spicy
hope
bite
at
the
end
but
smooth
caramel
malts
as
well
d
very
drinkable
very
flavorful
very
good
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
example
of
a
american
red
d
very
hoppy
amber
ale
from
bear
republic
thats
big
on
citrus
hops
tasty
hop
belching
ensues
good
mouthfeel
enough
carbonation
that
suits
this
beer
well
overall
probably
a
good
beer
based
on
its
high
score
here
but
definitely
not
high
on
my
list
again
to
be
fair
its
probably
more
that
the
beers
style
is
not
my
thing
rather
than
it
being
anything
wrong
with
the
beer
the
taste
is
similar
it
has
a
lot
of
floralpine
and
caramelly
grain
flavours
with
a
little
citrus
and
spice
this
fullbodied
pungent
flavour
nicely
accompanies
a
rich
caramelmalt
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
big
brew
with
a
solid
profile
and
a
wonderful
aromatic
hop
quality
almost
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
in
its
hop
quality
cheers
d
a
near
session
beer
perhaps
it
is
one
to
sum
up
rocket
red
ale
has
the
makings
of
an
excellent
beer
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
dont
quite
measure
up
yet
but
the
beer
is
eminently
quaffable
and
a
masterpiece
for
the
nose
and
eyes
i
hope
to
have
it
on
tap
soon
poured
a
deep
beep
brownamber
almost
black
instead
its
amber
that
is
nearly
brown
white
head
is
almost
more
than
an
inch
thick
nose
is
piney
but
little
else
appears
taste
is
very
fruity
and
very
citrusy
with
bitterness
taking
a
backseat
pretty
good
amber
at
a
decent
price
d
a
nice
balance
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
makes
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
overall
the
combination
of
a
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
hoppy
taste
balanced
by
some
malts
makes
this
beer
a
fairly
interest
and
nice
drinking
beer
pick
up
one
and
enjoy
a
session
with
it
if
you
can
this
ones
a
little
sharp
in
flavor
and
feel
kind
of
raw
and
pungent
not
insanely
drinkable
but
very
enjoyable
nevertheless
unapologetically
hoppy
and
why
not
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
had
of
an
amber
ale
and
a
quality
brew
that
will
get
return
visits
to
my
fridge
d
very
good
i
had
a
pint
with
dinner
than
two
more
afterwards
and
had
i
stayed
any
longer
i
wouldve
had
another
a
nicely
crafted
ale
and
certainly
one
worth
trying
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
complex
enough
to
hold
your
interest
and
it
goes
down
easy
drinkability
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
has
a
great
hoppy
bitterness
perfect
for
any
hophead
what
can
you
say
another
solid
offering
from
bear
republic
have
meant
to
pick
this
one
up
for
a
few
years
but
never
did
and
will
certaintly
do
so
again
bear
republic
has
yet
to
disappoint
recommended
it
had
a
moderate
amount
of
pine
hops
up
front
with
even
more
malt
flavoring
behind
that
nothing
but
hops
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
wasnt
too
strong
the
texture
wasnt
quite
as
dark
or
heavy
as
any
other
red
ive
had
and
it
was
somewhat
smooth
but
overall
it
nothing
spectacular
overall
this
was
a
great
session
ale
i
was
not
looking
for
anything
over
the
top
so
i
was
glad
it
was
the
way
it
was
nothing
special
just
an
all
around
solid
amber
here
could
always
be
a
good
call
and
a
great
one
to
just
kick
back
and
watch
the
game
with
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
d
tasty
and
very
drinkable
bomber
wasnt
too
expensive
either
lively
carbonation
medium
body
sticky
and
long
finish
easily
drinkable
kind
of
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
anderson
valley
selections
where
theyre
so
overhopped
you
cant
tell
that
anything
else
is
there
this
could
very
well
be
my
favorite
beer
period
i
cant
imagine
a
way
to
improve
on
this
beer
sticky
sweet
caramel
notes
an
awesome
mouthfeel
big
citrusy
smack
of
hops
beautiful
aroma
a
clean
finish
and
not
too
much
abv
to
keep
you
from
more
than
one
i
just
stare
at
the
ruby
brown
hues
mmm
a
perfect
beer
i
think
i
just
talked
myself
into
another
case
mouthfeel
was
excellent
nice
body
and
good
carbonation
level
pretty
easily
drinkable
for
sure
its
pushing
its
way
up
toward
and
imperial
version
of
the
style
but
yet
not
quite
getting
there
i
think
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all
nice
beer
poured
a
very
attractive
reddishbrown
color
with
fluffy
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
aroma
was
citrusy
hops
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
coming
through
flavor
was
citrusy
and
floral
hoppiness
malt
flavor
is
also
there
but
is
dominated
by
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
great
and
this
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
drinkability
is
good
this
is
one
fine
ale
it
has
a
pretty
full
mouthfeel
to
it
for
a
red
the
carbonation
is
medium
light
and
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
some
bready
tones
very
easy
to
drink
and
really
satisfying
a
top
notch
example
of
the
style
me
thinks
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
but
i
know
it
wont
be
long
before
i
pop
the
cap
on
that
one
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
big
thick
creamy
head
that
lasts
all
day
heavy
lacing
color
is
ambercaramel
very
clear
lots
of
nice
hop
aroma
piney
and
citrusy
initial
flavor
of
caramel
followed
by
tart
grapefruit
bite
finishes
dry
and
smooth
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
on
this
one
very
much
in
the
west
coast
style
red
rocket
poured
a
beautiful
crimson
red
that
a
long
lasting
white
head
of
foam
the
only
time
the
head
of
foam
receded
was
when
i
took
a
sip
of
beer
and
every
time
i
did
that
it
left
streak
after
streak
of
white
lace
the
aroma
was
heavy
with
pine
grapefruit
bitter
citrus
hops
citrus
fruits
and
anything
else
thats
related
to
citrus
flavors
the
taste
was
also
heavy
but
with
dried
citrus
hops
citrus
fruits
pine
needles
grapefruit
and
then
all
of
these
citrus
flavors
ended
with
a
big
taste
of
malted
rye
the
malted
rye
was
a
nice
surprise
i
was
only
expecting
the
taste
to
be
filled
with
nothing
but
citrus
flavors
of
all
kinds
it
was
a
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
that
had
a
refeshing
dry
aftertaste
of
citrus
fruits
bitter
citrus
hops
and
pine
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
from
a
bottle
i
sure
its
just
as
good
coming
from
a
bottle
another
great
beer
from
bear
republic
d
a
nice
dry
hopped
red
clean
but
lacked
complexity
sorry
to
say
d
i
loved
this
beer
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
this
is
what
i
have
found
i
like
in
an
amber
ale
the
lipsmacking
fruitiness
that
is
almost
like
a
fresh
organic
grapefruit
or
something
very
clean
and
tasty
ill
most
definitely
be
getting
this
again
and
again
pours
a
nice
clear
and
dark
ruby
hues
brown
thick
creme
head
nose
is
of
piney
hops
flavor
is
citric
earthy
and
has
a
noticeable
zing
to
it
calms
down
as
it
gets
warmer
smooth
feel
easily
drinkable
i
expect
no
less
from
bear
republic
a
nice
one
thats
much
better
on
the
warmer
side
good
drinkability
especially
so
with
an
easy
to
deal
with
abv
beers
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
clear
frothy
white
head
very
aromatic
hops
greet
the
nose
with
citrus
notes
a
big
malt
odor
lurks
behind
the
floral
hoppiness
with
a
slight
metallic
tinge
the
only
negative
oily
hoppiness
rolls
onto
the
tongue
with
an
orange
peel
flavor
and
medium
bitterness
the
thin
malt
flavor
is
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
but
still
detectable
during
the
middle
of
a
mouthful
but
when
the
brew
heads
for
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
moderate
astringency
and
stronger
hop
bitterness
quickly
drown
out
the
malt
the
metallic
note
in
the
nose
becomes
apparent
to
the
palate
on
the
aftertaste
i
really
didnt
much
care
for
this
one
notes
a
really
great
amberred
from
what
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
a
pretty
tasty
brew
i
wish
that
there
was
a
bit
more
residual
malt
sweetness
to
this
brew
a
solid
citrus
hop
character
would
have
been
really
nice
this
is
actually
slightly
tart
as
a
result
of
the
lack
of
sweetness
this
is
not
bone
dry
though
there
is
just
not
enough
malt
sweetness
to
stand
up
to
the
hops
this
brew
has
a
very
interesting
collection
of
flavors
its
not
an
instant
favorite
of
mine
but
id
buy
this
one
again
dark
rich
maroon
pour
with
a
big
lasting
beige
head
that
wouldnt
die
smell
was
rich
sticky
sweet
malt
and
almost
rye
like
touches
at
times
and
a
nice
vibrant
hop
blast
taste
was
quite
hoppy
but
suitably
backed
by
a
unique
maltiness
mouthfeel
was
lightly
carbonated
and
incredibly
smooth
going
down
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
pokes
out
ever
so
slightly
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
too
after
the
girlfriend
and
i
downed
the
bomber
this
one
grew
on
me
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
and
reminded
me
a
bit
of
their
hop
rod
rye
and
im
very
glad
we
get
these
here
in
austin
now

notes
this
is
a
great

for
many
reasons

calls

a

this
brew
shows
me
the
diversity
of
american
ambers
especially
those
one
would
call
imperial
amber
along
with
sweeter

and
a

i
loved
this
red
i
could
have
this
everyday
and
twice
on

pours

crazy
i
mean
red
red
i
make
red
ales
and
mine
are
brown
these
are
nice
and
red
and
clear
small
dense
creamcolored
head
that
stuck
around
a
bit
but
not
too
long
i
was
a
little
thrown
off
yet
again
by
the
smell
of
it
i
mean
it
was
light
and
a
bit
fruity
maybe
citrusy
wherere
the
earthy
malty
tones
but
what
the
heck
lets
taste
it
ah
nice
yes
this
is
a
red
ale
tons
o
malt
nice
and
bitter
clean
through
very
even
bitter
aftertaste
that
just
gently
fades
out
wow
if
i
could
only
have
one
beer
this
hmm
well
yeah
it
would
be
one
of
my
choices
bear
republic
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
beef
notes
maybe
ill
do
some
research
to
find
out
what
kind
of
hops
are
used
in
this
one
that
way
i
can
be
careful
of
other
beer
using
the
same
kind
a
good
beer
though
that
made
a
good
turnaround
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
coming
back
for
a
while
a
great
beer
to
just
relax
with
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
dense
light
khaki
head
good
lacing
smells
of
sharp
cutting
pinespruce
hops
with
a
citrusy
edge
light
notes
of
caramelized
malt
and
slight

taste
starts
off
with
light
roastysweet
caramel
maltiness
but
is
soon
cut
down
by
big
piney
bitter
medicinal
hops
finish
is
bitter
with
some
warming
and
lingering
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
big
and
the
balance
is
great
a
great
tasting
amber
ale
and
up
until
now
the
best
ive
had
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
racer
5
and
the
big
bear
black
i
have
in
the
cellar
ill
definitely
have
to
try
some
more
red
ales
for
comparison
but
this
is
quite
a
tasty
treat
i
really
like
the
products
from
this
brewery
overall
this
one
gets
a
thumbs
up
this
22
oz
bomber
poured
a
mahogony
colored
brew
that
formed
a
nice
lasting
head
a
cirtrusy
hopped
aroma
is
intertwined
nicely
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
diverseness
of
this
beers
taste
is
interesting
the
hop
ibu
has
to
be
fairly
high
as
it
hit
my
palate
pretty
hard
what
makes
this
beer
unique
is
the
caramel
malts
amongst
the
big
hop
factor
that
leads
to
an
interesting
smoked
finish
a
very
good
beer
that
a
hop
head
would
enjoy
ok
this
stuff
is
unusual
but
really
good
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
ebony
topped
off
by
a
fine
hardworking
frothy
head
the
first
thing
i
noticed
in
the
aroma
was
a
sweet
smokiness
almost
like
the
peaty
smell
in
a
scotch
ale
i
was
later
informed
that
that
is
deliberate
there
was
also
a
touch
of
citrus
as
if
the
hops
were
hiding
under
that
smouldering
residue
and
then
all
these
competing
interests
came
together
in
the
taste
which
was
remarkably
wellbalanced
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
creamy
and
the
aftertaste
just
a
touch
bitter
a
very
interesting
brew
im
not
sure
i
can
put
my
finger
on
it
what
a
great
brew
it
poured
a
magnificant
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
great
frothy
head
that
left
tons
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
good
with
a
nice
malt
scent
mixed
with
a
light
citrus
the
taste
was
just
awesome
and
unlike
any
amberred
that
i
have
ever
had
before
it
started
out
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
then
once
it
opened
up
it
had
a
great
smokey
flavor
to
it
followed
up
by
a
great
finishing
hop
bitterness
very
complex
flavor
and
as
it
warmed
it
tasted
even
better
a
new
favorite
of
mine
for
sure
taste
initial
lagerlike
flavors
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
biting
green
hops
and
a
semidry
finish
overall
a
generously
hopped
west
coast
delight
overall
a
fantastic
beer
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
a
hybrid
redscotchipa
type
ale
until
a
few
sips
in
when
i
read
the
bottle
really
an
outstanding
mix
of
styles
perfect
for
a
hophead
looking
for
something
with
a
little
bit
more
malty
depth
slight
tan
head
resulted
from
a
slow
gentle
pour
it
rested
on
top
of
a
crystal
clear
red
body
and
left
plenty
of
lace
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
was
of
pungent
hops
sliding
into
a
peaty
smokiness
and
a
slight
bready
note
probably
from
bottle
conditioning
taste
was
a
whole
lot
of
grapefruit
hops
delicately
balanced
with
a
slight
sticky
sweetness
and
caramel
which
comprised
the
strong
malty
backbone
there
was
more
of
the
smokey
flavor
that
rounded
the
taste
out
nicely
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
full
of
hops
yet
generally
smooth
and
easy
drinking
it
is
always
nice
to
find
red
ales
that
have
a
little
bit
of
oomph
and
a
unique
flavor
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger

looking

capped
by

inch
foamy

with
the
wood
dryness
sneaking
in

making

home
through
to
the

it
mixes
nicely
with

raisin
and
finishes
with
an

super
nice

of

linger
nicely
on

man
this
beer
is
something
if
you
are
not
a
lover
of
big
hoppy
beers
its
not
for
you
hop
heads
get
this
one
for
a
red
amber
ale
this
one
rewrites
the
rules
on
hops
after
being
misled
to
believe
that
this
was
a
toned
down
beer
i
am
glad
that
i
sampled
this
one
it
is
a
real
nice
brew
with
a
hoppy
punch
that
will
wake
you
up
at
night
update

i
rated
this
beer
so
high
back
in
november
2003
when
i
snagged
a
bottle
in
california
i
thought
id
rereview
a
2004
vintage
now
that
they
sell
it
here
in
seattle
at
bottleworks
this
thing
is
by
far
the
tastiest
and
biggest
redamber
ale
that
ive
ever
had
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
incredible
better
than
the
5
0
that
i
scored
it
after
1200
reviews
it
is
still
my
favor
red
ale
to
date
drinkability
tastes
hoppier
than
a
smoked
porter
and
milder
than
a
true
smoked
beer
not
a
fan
of
the
smokiness
in
this
one
my
least
favorite
offering
from
this
brewery
very
drikable
hook
up
the
red
rocket
iv
and
let
the
fun
begin
this
one
is
along
the
lines
of
speakeasy
prohibition
ale
with
a
more
roasted
flavour
notes
i
love
bigass
red
ales
lots
of
flavour
and
character
and
it
even
packs
a
punch
at
6
8
abv
this
one
went
great
with
some
chinese
style
spare
ribs
and
crab
rangoon
its
pours
a
rich
ruby
tinged
dark
amber
with
a
solid
beige
head
and
loads
of
sticky
lace
a
fresh
whole
hop
floral
bouquet
awakens
the
senses
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
pears
and
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
add
to
the
overall
excellence
of
the
aroma
toasty
malt
light
toffee
hint
of
chocolate
and
light
sweetness
is
revealed
in
graduating
degrees
as
it
warms
sharp
grapefruit
orange
peel
lemon
grass
and
hint
of
metallic
bite
make
up
a
wonderful
and
lively
hoppy
flavor
the
whole
creation
blends
and
balances
as
this
fine
brew
warms
though
hops
are
clearly
the
shining
star
here
this
beer
poured
a
deep
red
chestnut
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
settled
but
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
good
hoppy
and
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
oak
and
caramel
the
taste
was
dominated
by
the
hops
which
gave
an
astringency
to
the
beer
but
flavors
of
caramel
floral
hops
and
even
a
slight
sweetness
were
also
present
the
mouthfeel
was
very
dry
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
the
dry
astringency
was
balanced
somewhat
by
a
slight
sweet
and
tangy
feel
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
very
nice
and
very
hoppy
brew
very
enjoyable
appearance
first
off
massive
tan
moutnainous
thickets
of
fluffiness
within
the
head
complemented
by
the
color
of
the
deep
ruby
amber
brown
tone
this
ones
great
already
just
in
appearance
when
it
comes
to
lacing
this
one
layers
each
ring
on
thick
and
even
beautiful
beer
aroma
beautifully
balanced
with
spurts
of
hops
exploding
in
the
air
piney
and
floral
just
oh
so
good
hints
of
some
peated
malt
a
very
mild
smokiness
toasted
nuts
are
just
some
of
the
tones
i
am
picking
up
from
malt
profile
taste
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
the
aroma
wonderful
balance
but
distinct
in
your
face
flavors
making
a
wonderfully
melded
brew
from
healdsburg
ca
piney
hops
with
a
perfect
balance
of
mildly
sweet
toasted
and
slightly
musty
yeast
tones
awesome
flavor
here
so
good
and
balanced
making
this
another
22oz
that
goes
down
way
to
effortlessly
mouthfeel
fuller
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
for
imbibing
and
enjoying
this
beer
is
succulent
and
i
could
just
picture
pairing
it
with
a
medium
cooked
filet
mignon
the
flavors
seem
to
be
able
to
coexist
in
perfect
harmony
drinkability
as
i
said
earlier
in
the
review
effortless
but
its
much
more
than
that
when
you
edge
with
each
sip
toward
an
empty
glass
you
start
to
lessen
the
size
of
your
sips
and
yearn
for
another
bottle
to
appear
thats
what
should
happen
with
every
great
drinkable
beer
this
one
holds
true
all
so
well
not
my
favorite
of
their
styles
but
a
good
one
dark
copper
color
with
a
beige
frothy
head
that
settles
quickly
but
leaves
a
thick
bubbly
film
atop
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
hops
and
florals
punching
through
and
then
a
definite
alcohol
tingle
flavor
is
big
and
round
and
rich
and
creamy
real
nice
feel
rolling
over
the
tongue
its
full
of
so
much
toffee
and
malt
and
honey
and
sweet
pear
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
butterscotch
and
stings
the
back
of
the
throat
with
alcohol
very
warm
and
rich
and
ever
changing
flavor
this
is
very
complex
and
makes
you
want
more
to
keep
looking
for
more
nuances
pretty
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
notes
very
good
beer
very
smooth
flavor
good
attempt
at
a
bold
american
scottish
style
smoked
beers
tend
to
tire
out
my
taste
buds
after
a
while
you
wouldnt
catch
me
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
unless
i
was
at
a
smoked
beer
festival
or
something
it
drinks
very
nicely
not
too
heavy
a
very
nice
version
of
the
scottish
ale
variety
for
my
personal
taste
it
is
a
bit
sweet
a
nice
diversion
for
me
when
i
do
not
want
an
ipa
well
crafted
583
billed
as
a
scottish
red
ale
this
brew
is
definitely
a
hoppy
interpretation
of
the
style
but
quite
good
nonetheless
and
i
suppose
to
be
expected
from
the
west
coast
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
rings
throughout
consumption
the
nose
is
quite
complex
fruity
light
english
toffee
which
personally
i
distinguish
from
caramel
when
it
seems
just
slightly
buttery
and
citrus
all
nicely
integrated
nothing
dominates
the
aromas
dont
quite
translate
to
the
tastebuds
pnw
hops
are
evident
along
with
some
caramel
and
just
enough
bitter
roasted
barley
i
dont
get
the
smokiness
that
others
have
mentioned
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
be
on
the
thin
side
for
a
6
8
abv
beer
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
brew
a
deep
red
colored
scotch
ale
with
a
medium
beige
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
peat
roasted
malts
are
slighlty
sweet
with
a
nice
mellow
hop
signature
some
sweetness
finish
is
clean
and
soft
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
some
sweetness
originally
sampled
on
13
february
2003
had
this
on
draught
at
the
anthill
pub
uc
irvine
this
pours
a
beautiful
dark
reddish
brown
color
its
clear
w
a
tan
head
nice
hoppiness
but
not
to
the
degree
of
überipas
on
the
west
coast
leaves
you
w
a
warm
glow
this
is
a
very
well
built
flavorful
beer
however
it
is
not
for
the
light
of
heart
or
taste
for
that
matter
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
heavy
cream
head
the
aroma
of
heavy
peat
smoked
malt
and
roasted
toffee
is
very
inviting
the
flavor
follows
along
the
same
lines
with
a
hearty
smoky
smooth
malt
flavor
and
thick
body
paired
with
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
creamy
finish
mucho
gracias
to
gusler
for
making
this
meeting
possible
surprisingly
dark
color
but
lighter
in
flavor
an
interesting
interplay
between
the
lighter
malt
and
tartnes
of
a
red
and
the
more
substantial
malt
heft
of
a
scottish
ale
with
a
touch
of
roasted
porter
thrown
in
for
good
measure
a
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
wasnt
anything
like
i
expected
but
completely
satisfied
none
the
less
was
expecting
a
red
ale
but
this
is
more
like
a
cross
between
a
red
ale
and
a
porter
poured
thick
with
a
beautiful
fluffy
head
and
thick
lacing
around
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
in
fact
i
was
really
impessed
by
the
thickness
of
the
lacing
and
the
beautiful
almost
mountainlike
head
tasted
real
nice
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
just
enough
to
provide
some
fragrance
and
bitterness
and
malt
which
was
of
a
toasty
smoky
stout
like
roast
this
was
my
first
encounter
with
bear
republic
and
surely
a
sign
of
good
things
to
come
this
is
one
hell
of
a
bastardization
of
a
scotch
ale
those
scots
never
had
access
to
these
kinds
and
amounts
of
hops
regardless
it
works
the
head
is
thick
but
not
deep
the
typical
bear
republic
foamy
rippled
moonsurface
head
interesting
aroma
of
malt
interesting
taste
how
to
put
this
in
a
category
first
some
malt
then
a
smoky
smoky
burn
the
malt
tries
but
is
overcome
by
hops
and
charcoal
bitter
aftertaste
starts
sweet
but
just
cannot
end
there
on
the
bottle
br
says
this
unfiltered
bottleconditioned
ambercolored
ale
breaks
all
style
molds
true
i
do
not
know
what
to
call
this
thing
it
is
like
a
scotch
ale
but
it
also
has
belgian
spiciness
a
marzen
snap
and
a
stoutlike
sourness
who
cares
what
category
it
lands
in
they
admit
that
it
does
not
fit
and
that
is
resplendent
honesty
this
is
a
fun
beer
i
will
keep
one
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
an
excellent
tweaked
ipa
and
a
very
fucked
up
scotch
ale
cherry
stained
tea
topped
by
pale
tan
head
that
is
nicely
creamy
and
lasting
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
has
a
slight
hop
bite
nicely
malty
flavor
toffee
smoky
peat
really
doughy
character
teh
hops
dont
quite
seem
to
match
the
malt
though
obviously
not
in
the
same
class
as
hop
rod
rye
and
racer
5
but
still
a
quality
beer
thanks
to
valleyboy
for
the
sample
through
the
christmas
beer
exchange
carefully
poured
its
fairly
clear
with
just
a
few
specks
of
yeast
sediment
i
personally
prefer
it
with
the
yeast
and
give
it
a
swirl
but
it
still
remains
just
hazy
not
cloudy
the
body
is
a
very
deep
copper
and
its
topped
by
a
frothy
ivory
head
that
holds
exceptionally
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
some
sweet
lightly
smoky
and
carameltinged
malt
as
well
as
some
grassy
and
spicy
hops
although
it
doesnt
really
become
apparent
until
it
warms
the
full
body
is
accentuated
by
a
natural
carbonation
from
bottle
conditioning
restrained
2
2
vol
co2
with
very
tiny
bubbles
and
its
quite
creamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
very
nice
the
rich
grassy
hops
are
the
first
thing
thats
noticed
in
the
flavor
followed
by
some
soft
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
smokiness
as
it
crosses
the
palate
before
finishing
with
a
rousingly
dry
and
bitter
finish
long
lingering
hop
flavors
and
some
residual
smokiness
keep
it
interesting
and
remind
you
that
you
have
a
beer
in
front
of
you
very
well
done
and
quite
enjoyable
also
very
unique
as
well
well
worth
trying
citric
hop
aroma
hits
you
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
pours
mediumbrown
in
color
wellcarbonated
with
a
halffinger
head
aroma
remains
quite
hoppy
as
the
beer
sits
though
caramellike
malt
notes
eventually
begin
to
shine
through
big
cascade
hop
flavor
up
front
so
big
in
fact
that
i
begin
to
wonder
about
the
appropriateness
of
calling
this
a
scotch
ale
good
grainy
malt
body
with
some
real
depth
caramel
sweetness
and
some
very
light
toasted
notes
you
need
to
enjoy
it
quick
though
because
the
hops
dont
let
themselves
be
overpowered
for
long
finish
is
very
bitter
and
remains
present
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
citric
and
fruity
great
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
notchedup
sam
adams
lager
than
a
scotch
ale
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
bitter
amber
this
is
a
good
way
to
go
the
beer
begins
a
nice
limpid
deep
garnet
color
the
head
imposing
and
frothy
in
its
texture
leaving
a
thick
glutinous
sheet
of
lace
to
seal
off
the
glass
you
are
greeted
by
malt
and
some
light
to
middling
floral
tones
from
the
hops
fresh
and
quite
pleasing
to
the
senses
begins
sweet
the
top
is
middling
in
feel
the
finish
bitingly
acidic
the
hops
spiteful
in
their
spicy
bite
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
what
a
hoot
another
winner
from
this
most
excellent
brewery
if
you
get
the
chance
i
would
suggest
that
you
stick
one
of
these
on
your
launch
pad
and
go
for
a
couple
laps
of
the
earth
in
geostationary
orbit
rockit
slightly
hazy
candy
apple
red
color
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
great
looking
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
huge
sticky
piney
hoppiness
with
some
subtle
citrus
fruit
aromas
as
well
light
malt
aroma
that
keeps
the
smell
in
check
nice
strong
and
sweet
malty
taste
starts
things
off
in
this
brew
nice
bittering
hop
finish
that
lingers
nicely
on
the
tongue
excellent
tangy
hoppy
characteristics
in
this
brew
make
it
very
tasty
nice
and
smooth
brew
that
is
rather
tangy
on
the
tongue
but
yet
a
nice
sweetness
as
well
great
brew
and
this
brewery
is
now
two
for
two
in
my
book
excellent
brews
interesting
combination
of
flavors
american
pine
and
citrus
hop
character
dominates
some
complex
malt
flavors
but
a
little
lost
a
nice
malt
background
but
a
richer
malt
profile
would
have
been
nice
since
they
call
it
scottish
a
pretty
good
beer
and
well
balanced
but
the
stong
american
hop
character
seems
at
odds
to
the
malt
profile
and
low
esters
enjoyable
nonetheless
another
outstanding
ale
from
bear
republic
deep
dark
amber
color
piny
scent
great
head
although
there
wasnt
much
lace
to
decorate
the
glass
awsome
hop
flavor
that
explodes
in
your
mouth
this
one
is
definately
a
keeper
although
i
think
most
of
bear
republics
are
keepers
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
a
little
to
bitter
from
first
sip
to
last
gulp
nice
redish
hue
in
the
apperance
but
after
that
it
is
just
another
average
beer
at
least
for
me
another
grand
slam
by
the
folks
at
bear
republic
butterscotch
alchohalic
esters
an
interesting
malt
characteristic
and
a
slow
and
mellow
hop
profile
this
is
nothing
less
than
a
fabulous
brew
rich
complex
heavy
body
almost
creamy
texture
the

is
deceiving
it
feels
much
higher

you

my
admiration

by

and
a
hint
of
roasted

sharpness
is
accompanied
by
a
piney

rich
chewy

backbone
to
satisfy
my
malt
cravings
and
an
assertively
bitter
citrusy

full

satisfying
all
around

enough
to
dominate
but
just
enough
to
make
the

is
wonderful
to

republic
has
put
out
it
has
a
nice
tan
head
sitting
on
top
of
a
pretty
reddishbrown
beer
hops
are
more
than
noticeable
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
nicely
balanced
by
the
malt
at
close
to
7
abv
its
dangerously
drinkable
force
your
macrodrinking
friends
to
try
it
blindfolded
it
might
change
their
lives
this
is
a
wonderful
wonderful
beer
richardo
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
beer
everyone
should
be
able
to
enjoy
this
brew
ok
this
is
totally
over
hopped
for
a
scottish
i
hate
to
even
call
it
a
scottish
but
it
is
billed
as
a
basterdized
scottish
a
good
to
very
good
beer
red
in
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
reduces
to
a
film
of
bubbles
covering
the
enter
top
of
the
beer
throughout
liked
the
flowery
hoppy
backbone
needed
more
ipa
type
punch
smell
of
flowery
hops
and
a
bit
of
malt
solid
red
ipa
smooth
omodestly
above
standard
commecial
beers
i
was
hoping
for
more
punch
disappointed
not
really
a
good
beer
an
enormous
hoppy
red
beer
that
ive
been
way
too
sick
on
one
too
many
times
in
life
but
every
time
i
go
back
to
it
i
cant
help
being
impressed
with
it
its
a
frothy
feeling
beer
only
a
touch
sweet
from
the
red
grain
and
super
hoppy
like
a
west
coast
ipa
its
got
a
real
cascade
hop
profile
and
is
both
oily
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
the
beer
has
a
sticky
feel
with
its
big
body
and
all
these
hops
but
it
finishes
rather
dry
for
what
it
is
if
you
arent
a
totally
gungho
hop
head
this
beer
probably
isnt
for
you
its
a
total
hop
overdose
and
even
a
couple
of
these
will
have
you
feeling
silly
this
was
way
ahead
of
its
time
i
think
and
is
only
now
starting
to
get
recognition
for
being
the
beast
that
it
is
not
ithacas
best
but
certainly
one
of
me
more
distinctive
india
pale
ales
on
the
market
sweet
sour
bitter
hoppy
and
malty
solid
very
solid
o
i
had
this
beer
last
summer
and
really
didnt
stand
out
to
me
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
there
are
alot
better
red
ipas
out
there
i
recommend
it
to
people
who
like
malty
ipas
a
very
good
beer
that
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
with
an
intense
hop
profile
that
steals
the
show
and
enough
malt
to
counterbalance
the
intense
bitterness
not
terribly
drinkable
per
se
since
the
alcohol
is
pretty
high
here
but
it
is
good
for
a
round
or
two
it
would
pair
well
with
some
carrot
cake
for
sure
omaybe
its
bias
since
i
grew
up
a
half
hour
from
ithaca
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
despite
the
past
bb
date
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
red
ipas
but
i
enjoyed
the
added
malt
that
was
present
a
ton
of
flavor
and
very
drinkable
well
worth
trying
really
nice
mix
of
flavours
all
balanced
really
well
complexity
opens
up
really
well
just
a
well
put
together
beer
that
offers
a
very
good
example
of
what
a
red
ipa
can
be
all
about
very
nice
would
have
again
cascade
hops
work
really
well
here
citrus
and
florals
come
through
strongly
well
balanced
but
slightly
pushed
back
on
the
hops
as
in
not
being
extremely
hoppy
however
still
a
good
beer
with
hoppy
flavors
and
a
nice
malty
body
overall
quite
pleased
with
this
brew
its
definantly
no
flower
power
but
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
hoppy
red
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
hazy
reddish
amber
aroma
has
toasty
caramel
light
citrus
raisin
and
other
dark
fruits
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
plum
and
light
hop
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
with
a
clean
finish
overall
a
delicious
wellcrafted
beer
the
main
drawback
is
the
malt
overwhelms
the
hop
characteristics
there
are
some
complex
flavors
here
with
roasted
malts
fruity
esters
and
a
nice
hop
mix
o
a
very
good
red
ipa
tasty
and
drinkable
if
this
is
really
over
a
year
old
im
impressed
with
its
staying
power
o
definitely
a
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
by
ithaca
so
far
this
one
strikes
a
nice
balance
with
its
ingredients
rather
than
their
other
beers
in
which
certain
ingredients
tend
to
dominate
overall
cascazilla
is
not
to
big
not
too
small
they
go
down
nice
easy
its
easy
to
drink
but
has
some
alcohol
content
it
seems
to
me
like
a
good
candidate
to
be
enjoyed
from
a
heavy
pint
glass
overall
for
a
red
ipa
i
was
expecting
a
lot
of
malt
which
a
got
with
a
minimal
amount
of
hopping
for
the
style
this
is
a
real
nice
brew
if
i
ever
see
this
on
tap
somewhere
i
would
get
it
so
far
ithaca
hasnt
disappointed
me
this
is
a
great
beer
hoppy
but
caramel
malt
is
very
present
in
its
flavor
not
only
giving
body
to
sustain
its
hoppy
profile
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
guessing
that
it
must
have
been
best
by
october
2013
since
i
cantt
believe
hop
taste
would
have
hung
around
for
a
year
sediment
finally
settled
was
a
long
drink
possibly
malt
have
enjoyed
this
on
draft
in
the
past
and
would
have
it
again
hopefully
with
less
floaties
o
a
decent
red
ipa
but
nothing
id
put
in
my
top
5
for
sure
the
tartness
is
a
bit
much
this
is
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
red
but
cant
quite
compete
with
the
top
tier
reds
out
there
overall
very
well
done
red
ipa
nails
the
malthop
balance
which
can
be
difficult
to
do
well
for
the
style
thus
my
overall
will
fall
as
an
inbetweener
for
an
amber
ale
its
pretty
tasty
for
an
ipa
its
a
little
disappointing
yet
again
i
find
myself
hoping
to
get
a
fresh
bottle
and
see
if
my
opinion
changes
or
if
this
is
just
indicative
of
the
style
this
is
the
first
and
maybe
the
last
beer
that
i
will
have
from
the
ithaca
beer
company
i
might
need
to
chug
a
ruthless
rye
before
i
go
to
bed

horrific

it
doesnt

long
enough
to
ruin
the
beer
overall
i
think
the

could
be
more

its
a
fine

it
is
rich

had
all
the
qualities
you
look
for
but
nothing
exceptional
and
not
enough
hops
to
be
considered
a
true
red
ipa
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
flower
power
needs
some
more
fruitiness
but
the
umami
notes
are
delightful
overall
a
decent
american
amber
it
has
a
nice

flavor
blend
starting
with
more
of
a
citrus
and
developing
more
of
a
pine

on

fine

smooth

hoppy
the
rich
flavor
and

blend
wonderfully
with
the
alcohol
content
so
that
you
would
never
guess
it
is
as
strong
as
it
is
not
until
you
finish
the
second
beer
the
best
of
ithaca
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
red
such
a
nice
springtime
beer
that
is
good
to
drink
and
share
with
other
red
ales
one
of
ithacas
better
beers
for
sure
love
it
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
amber
with
a
small
amount
of
off
white
head
the
head
sticks
around
more
than
i
would
have
guessed
the
nose
has
some
nice
citrus
hops
in
it
as
well
as
a
touch
of
malt
spice
i
found
the
taste
to
be
more
interesting
than
the
smell
the
citrus
peel
hops
are
stronger
and
the
malt
backs
them
up
nicely
im
also
getting
a
mild
fruity
undertone
the
body
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
slightly
slick
overall
very
drinkable
had
it
after
a
yards
brawler
pugilist
so
it
came
across
as
much
more
flavorful
a
dusky
brownish
red

a
light
covering
and
some
lace
mild
grapefruit
and
citrus
caramel
sweetness
with
a
toasted
whole

underpin
light

taste
is
lovely
and

is
surprisingly
cask
like
mild
and
smooth

bitterness
with
a
toasted
caramel
malt
core
an
almost
english
fruitiness
in
the

no

finish
is
quite
clean
and
dry
with
light
grapefruit
and
faint
coffee
note
feel
is
like
the
name
says
mildly
carbonated
but
perfectly
so
supple
and
highly
drinkable
a
super
beer
that
hides
its
abv
well
so
beer
careful
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
id
like
to
get
a
really
fresh
version
of
this
to
rereview
it
overall
an
easy
drinking
tasty
red
ale
which
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
pretty
good
hoppy
amber
ale
its
right
at
the
bestby
date
so
i
bet
the
hops
would
be
really
nice
if
fresher
o
a
very
good
example
of
an
american
red
ale
i
wish
it
was
6
vs
7
so
i
could
keep
drinking
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
this
style
but
it
turns
out
to
be
great
as
the
weather
gets
cold
given
we
have
a
lot
more
cold
ahead
of
us
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
in
the
fridge
worth
trying
overall
really
dig
this
dont
care
if
this
is
hoppy
or
not
just
a
solid
good
amber
o
excellent
amber
ale
oa
decent
amber
ale
but
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
and
lacking
some
of
the
complexity
of
other
ambers
zoe
nugget
nectar
drink
a
really
nice
extra
i
could
see
this
being
amazing
fresher
always
next
time
o
good
beer
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
on
draft
this
drink
by
date
of
july
so
should
still
be
good
according
to
label
not
a
bad
showing
by
ithaca
but
just
not
at
the
level
of
nugget
nectar
which
is
better
o
a
great
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
earthy
grassy
dank
hoppiness
and
round
malting

thanks
to
the
guy
at
the
store
for
putting
this
together
for
me
so
my
brother
could
grab
it
for
me
while
in
long
island
he
either
didnt
no
his
stuff
or
purposely
screwed
me
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
half
inch
off
white

leaves
some
lace
smell
is
carmel
pine
apricot
and
grass
taste
is
similar
with
a
kind
of
stale
apricot
and
carmel
finish
not
bad
for
being
a
little
old
body
is
medium
enough
life
not
really
dry
and
drinkable
enough
will
edit
my
review
if
i
have
fresh
i
have
been
burned
before
when
having
someone
pick
it
up
or
online
orders
this
is
why
i
normally
avoid
getting
ipas
or
dipas
with
out
someone
giving
the
date
o
solid
beer
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
it
didnt
stand
up
to
others
i
have
had
o
one
of
the
more
memorable
american
reds
ive
had
in
a
while
this
one
is
right
at
the
end
of
its
optimal
freshness
period
but
its
still
drinking
very
well
oa
wonderful
beer
not
as
good
as
nugget
nectar
but
the
everyday
availability
is
a
huge
plus
believe
this
is
a
specific
bottle
issue
storage
or
bottling
rather
than
a
recipe
issue
or
problem
with
the
beer
itself
will
definitely
try
again
but
may
well
purchase
a
single
next
time
o
very
good
really
glad
laxer8811
sent
this
mouthfeel
is
very
very
pleasant
medium
body
with
light
fuzzy
carbonation
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
the
smell
doesnt
do
the
flavor
justice
but
in
all
other
aspects
the
beer
is
nice
this
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
amber
color
body
with
2
tan
head
the
smell
was
malty
with
nice
a
hop
background
to
it
the
taste
is
of
bitter
hops
and
some
malt
and
fruit
notes
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
was
nice
a
smooth
and
overall
a
really
good
beer
overy
solid
offering
from
ithaca
age
is
no
friend
to
this
beer
as
is
my
experience
with
the
bottled
version
ive
had
better
red
ales
but
i
really
like
what
ithaca
did
here
i
just
have
the
same
issues
i
have
with
flower
power
this
needs
to
dry
out
otherwise
its
adequately
interesting
oi
thought
this
one
going
to
be
one
of
those
red
ales
that
borderline
an
ipa
but
its
definitely
more
of
a
red
ale
its
slightly
complex
and
sort
of
balanced
but
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
for
it
overall
pretty
good
not
as
smooth
but
im
not
complaining
made
to
be
something
comfortable
enough
that
youll
to
really
like
it
but
not
enough
to
call
great
hope
you
all
enjoyed
salud
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
with
nice
flavor
mouthfeel
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced

slightly
cloudy

a

to
this
one
orange

grapefruit
hops
with
a
nice
bit
of
piney
hop
character
too
under
that
is
a
fair
amount
of
caramel
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
but
there
still
is
some
good
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavor
and
bite
to
it
just
a
moderate
bitterness
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
o
the
best
parts
about
this
beer
were
the
parts
that
i
put
a
little
else
stock
in
scent
and
taste
were
just
off
putting

unpleasant
not
the

and
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
fruitiness
there
is
some
earthiness
and
a
nice
mild
hop
presence
that
comes
through
as
well
the
finish
leaves
a
bit
of
lingering
sweetness
and
mild
hop
bitterness
this
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
smooth
feel
to
it
there
is
some
good
sweetness
here
that
is
nicely
balanced
out
by
the
mild
hop
bitterness
there
is
some
earthiness
as
well
there
is
some
good
drinkability
here
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
the
flavor
is
really
nice
and
it
never
gets
boring

ive
had
this
beer
in
many
ways
btl
floral

medium
bodied
flavorful
nonetheless
it
is
still
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
d
well
i
dont
really
like
it
and
would
maybe
get
a
fresh
bottle
but
i
believe
i
can
find
more
hoppy
brews
so
its
just
ok
in
my
book
this
one
may
get
lost
in
the
shadow
of
flower
power
but
this
one
stands
on
its
own
ive
always
been
a
fan
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
carbonated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
7
deasy
drinking
but
not
a
terribly
thoughtprovoking
or
interesting
beer
this
is
a
hopforward
amber
with
the
cascade
really
bringing
the
hop
complexity
to
the
beer
its
not
as
big
and
hoppy
as
nugget
nectar
but
its
in
the
same
vein
d
this
is
well
put
together
but
not
necessarily
a
top
beer
of
the
style
however
i
loved
this
beer
and
would
pick
this
up
regularly
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
tasty
and
complex
beer
but
i
wish
it
had
a
thicker
body
still
good
stuff
clearly
this
beer
was
brewed
to
be
more
muscular
than
its
name
implies
im
a
fan
the
cascazilla
has
a
wide
variety
of
flavor
quite
unique
malty
hoppy
sweet
and
bitter
all
in
one
some
strong
flavors
but
they
make
a
great
flavor
overall
edge
to
the
hops
here
throwing
off
the
balance
a
bit
but
it
is
cascazilla
and
was
designed
in
this
fashion
not
bad
i
liked
the
flavor
but
i
thought
it
could
use
more
hops
maybe
the
keg
i
sampled
from
had
been
around
a
while
but
i
expected
more
one
or
two
is
all
id
drink
of
this
its
a
good
red
ale
but
nothing
too
special
its
okay
no
standout
qualities
though
the
7
hardly
seemed
to
show
up
in
any
facet
notable
i
suppose
a
cheap
sixpack
beer
provided
i
can
sniff
it
out
cheap
but
really
it
was
a
onepint
stand
i
experienced
the
cascazilla
with
my
favorite
sausage
pizza
and
was
very
satisfied
with
how
well
they
both
got
along
into
a
pint
glass
this
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
slight
red
hue
and
carried
a
light
sweet
malt
and
citrus
blended
nose
it
opened
up
with
a
mildly
sweet
taste
into
a
malty
center
before
ending
with
a
light
grapefruit
bitter
aftertaste
nice
balance
and
complexity
in
general
and
a
great
carbonated
mouthfeel
to
cleanse
the
palate
for
that
next
bite
of
pizza
ill
be
revisiting
this
again
soon
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
burnt
orange
a
thick
offwhite
head
sticks
around
bigtime
i
pick
up
some
pretty
decent
floral
and
herbal
tones
from
the
smell
as
well
as
some
sweet
and
dark
syrupy
notes
nice
and
complex
taste
starts
off
mellow
but
quickly
twists
into
a
green
minty
hops
thus
the
feel
is
cool
and
smooth
is
that
detritus
taste
from
the
yeast
ala
mendocino
the
hops
stay
around
at
the
end
along
with
some
earthy
barley
backing
the
malts
are
kind
of
subdued
on
this
one
my
only
complaint
the
beer
feels
just
a
bit
flat
and
round
as
a
whole
yet
because
of
the
interesting
hops
its
pretty
tasty
a
favorite
of
the
ambers
that
ive
tried
m
full
bodied
with
gentle
carbonation
extremely
smooth
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
dogfish
ipa
particularly
90
minute
a
lot
of
my
friends
love
dogfish

id
recommend
this
beer
to
any
of
them
but
much
like
dogfish
90
and
most
east

ipas
for
that
matter
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
drinkability
is
only
fair
because
the
flavors
are
really
unique
but
i
cant
imagine
coming
back
to
this
again
and
again
while
this
brew
wasnt
really
what
i
was
expecting
it
blends
some
interesting
flavors
and
some
new
ones
id
never
experienced
pick
it
up
once
anyway
unique
to
me
happy
to
try
it

really

i
liked
it
when
i
first
had
it
on

and
now
i
like
it
in
just
different
ways
where
it
was

now
it
is
hoppy

this
is

overall
not

a

i
want

this

from

it
is
nothing

to
be

not

this

is

nice
and

dont
expect
it
to
be
as
sharp
as
some
better
reds
carbonation
level
is

continues

i
would
think
about

this

i
would
also
never
take
this

over

not
quite

it

a

flat
on

drinkability
is
a
bit
on

side
will
seek
out
a

or

get

i
thought
it
was
going
to
be

hop
bomb
but
it
turns
out
to
be
extremely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
reds
usually
arent
my
thing
but
i
could
drink
this
often
drinkable
enough
a
decent
brew
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
red
ale
roasted
malt
for
me
with
a
name
like
cascazilla
i
expected
it
to
focus
more
on
the
hops
overall
a
decent
beer
the
oak
and
hops
play
pretty
well
tasty
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
tasty
pretty
ruby
hue
with
a
moderately
sized
head
decent
lacing
and
retention
nice
blast
of
cascade
hops
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
taste
the
initial
flavor
is
very
hop
forward
followed
by
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
with
appropriate
sweetness
the
feel
is
great
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
as
its
hidden
quite
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
for
7
it
has
been
more
than
a
year
since
i
last
had
this
brew
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
am
reviewing
it
and
it
certainly
was
much
different
than
i
remembered
it
being
not
bad
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
prost
dthis
beer
is
not
too
hard
to
drinkstrong
alchohol
if
you
like
hops
you
should
have
no
problem
with
this
beer
the
red
malt
is
interesting
and
makes
an
unusual
pair
with
the
hops
a
fruity
taste
tries
to
poke
its
way
out
but
is
kept
at
bay
by
the
hops
i
may
buy
this
again
when
i
crave
a
strong
beer
with
lots
of
hops
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
an
entire
6er
of
this
and
with
this
being
my
last
one
i
figured
it
was
time
to
review
excellent
beer
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
these
all
around
this
tends
to
remind
me
the
most
of
an
esb
but
with
an
exaggerated
hop
bitterness
focus
d
i
would
only
go
for
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
maybe
two
but
they
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
grab
i
would
recommend
picking
this
up
if
you
come
across
it
fresh
d
this
is

drinkable

big
spicy
hoppy
nose
with
an
earthy
caramel
malt
backbone
the
cascade
hops
are
definitely
the
star
here
but
its
balanced
quite
well
with
a
nice
toasty
caramel
malt
sweetness
great
earthy
herbal
taste
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
a
very
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
that
truly
sets
it
apart
from
the
standard
red
nice
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
really
smooth
finish
extremely
drinkable
for
a
7
beer
this
may
have
just
taken
the
top
spot
for
me
in
the
red
beer
category
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
more
of
this
d
decent
and
a
unique
red
ale
likeable
but
nothing
amazing
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
once
tasted
from
12oz
bottle
obtained
in
a
trade
pours
dark
amber
with
a
medium
bubbly
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
lace
nose
is
both
hoppy
with
citrus
and
soap
and
malty
with
bread
and
hay
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
hoppier
with
the
malts
taking
a
back
seat
the
hops
linger
for
a
long
time
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
the
body
is
light
with
lively
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
but
the
watery
body
and
active
carbonation
dont
quite
fit
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
it
is
lacking
the
complexity
and
depth
that
i
look
for
d
a
very
average
amber
from
ithaca
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stands
out
and
sets
it
apart
that
being
said
its
not
bad
either
and
definitely
something
that
i
can
see
myself
reaching
for
again
give
it
a
try
if
youre
into
the
style
as
its
a
fairly
solid
representation
decently
balanced
malty
core
with
light
hop
finish
much
maltier
than
i
was
expecting
with
a
name
like
cascazilla
sits
much
heavier
and
is
much
sweeter
and
not
quite
as
dry
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
picked
up
lots
of
fruit
notes
over
all
a
vert
drinkable
beer
much
sweeter
finish
rather
than
a
dry
bitter
hop
finish
7abv
i
dont
believe
it
this
beer
feels
like
5
id
like
to
think
i
could
drink
a
6er
of
this
in
an
evening
but
id
probably
end
up
puking
and
sleeping
upright
to
avoid
the
spins
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
remarkable
would
have
like
a
little
more
hop
presence
in
the
taste
to
balance
the
sweet
caramel
flavors
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
likely
wont
seek
this
out
again
either
d
this
is
very
enjoyable
probably
better
fresher
but
a
very
worthy
amber
had
this
on
tap
that
the
ithaca
beer
company
store
front
it
was
an
amber
beer
with
some
haziness
to
it
it
smells
of
grapefruit
and
hops
im
assuming
from
the
name
that
the
beer
was
brewed
primarily
solely
with
cascade
hops
a
little
thick
with
hop
oils
on
the
tongue
but
overall
a
good
beer
to
kick
back
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
fall
asleep
with
as
it
is
pretty
strong
a
good
red
ale
that
showcases
hops
rather
than
malts
aggressive
in
bite
and
bitterness
my
first
bottle
of
this
i
didnt
know
the
abv
because
its
not
listed
on
the
bottle
then
i
cracked
another
one
to
do
the
review
and
surprise
7
i
would
have
guessed
something
like
5
a
little
dangerous
but
its
a
beautiful
friday
night
on
my
back
porch
and
i
really
dont
see
a
problem
with
drinking
the
whole
six
pack
it
was
a
long
week
but
needless
to
say
really
good
drinkability
if
you
dont
mind
the
7
a
great
session
beer
hop
forward
with
a
recovery
of
some
bitterness
that
you
can
attribute
to
the
toasted
malt
which
there
is
plenty
of
some
breadygrainness
follows
to
a
lightly
bitter
and
malty
finish
flavors
are
a
bit
soft
which
you
can
also
call
smooth
this
might
put
some
people
off
but
i
like
it
makes
it
quite
drinkable
good
balance
medium
bodied
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
very
good
beer
holy
dogshit
this
is
7
no
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
ok
very
dangerous
beer
here
d
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
treat
from
ithaca
hides
the
7
abv
very
well
quaffable
and
quenching
solid
all
the
way
around
an
assertive
and
formidable
american
red
ale
drinkability
cascazilla
is
a
fantastically
complex
and
hoppy
red
ale
that
reminds
me
of
a
bold
pale
ale
the
richness
of
the
malt
profile
in
addition
to
the
bold
yet
controlled
hop
presence
make
for
one
delicious
beer
drinkability
this
has
a
bit
of
a
kick
on
the
finish
probably
from
the
abv
funny
this
drinks
like
a
brown
ale
but
has
the
hops
of
an
apa
solid
drinking
beer
would
try
again
a
good
balanced
ipa
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
and
goes
down
well
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
refreashing
feel
to
it
nice
deep
amber
color
very
clear
with
an
off
white
fluffy
head
of
2
well
retained
and
spots
of
lace
left
aroma
is
full
of
pine
and
resin
with
grapefruit
zest
and
a
healthy
caramel
malt
background
taste
is
a
hop
bomb
rich
bitterness
and
herbal
hops
all
over
the
place
i
hardly
discern
the
malts
here
metallic
as
well
not
sure
where
this
fits
in
though
somewhat
slick
mouthfeel
decently
full
bodied
for
a
red
ale
not
something
i
would
get
all
the
time
but
i
definitely
think
its
worth
a
try
heavy
clingy
hop
demon
after
two
would
i
have
another
maybe
not
a
tad
too
sweet
and
the
hops
dont
clear
that
the
way
they
should
but
it
brings
the
humulus
hop
bill
in
the
taste
is
a
bit
unexpected
im
getting
piney
hops
here
some
initial
bitterness
followed
by
the
piney
kick
and
some
lingering
sweetness
from
the
malt
something
here
just
isnt
right
not
exactly
what
i
thought
i
was
getting
myself
into
i
would
like
a
bigger
body
on
this
one
but
also
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
though
im
not
sure
if
i
can
have
that
decent
drink
ill
have
to
revisit
it
in
the
future
d
red
ales
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
one
was
really
tasty
and
went
down
great
i
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
more
notes
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
a
great
find
from
a
great
brewery
cheers
d
i
wouldnt
guzzle
these
per
se
but
definitely
would
seek
them
out
and
drink
a
sixer
1
or
2
at
a
time
great
beer
please
check
out
my
video
review
www

comusergoodbeerinc
id
be
happy
to
get
this
again
loads
of
flavor
for
around
9
a
six
pack
those
that
enjoy
hop
flavor
of
the
grapefruit
variety
should
check
this
out
although
i
was
expecting
an
overpowering
ipa
flavor
with
a
name
like
cascazilla
the
hoppiness
is
toned
down
somewhat
but
not
to
the
detriment
of
the
brew
there
is
indeed
a
nice
hop
flavor
but
it
falls
off
extremely
quickly
a
good
refreshing
offering
from
ithaca
maybe
difficult
to
enjoy
more
than
two
in
a
single
session
but
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
decent
but
not
memorable
red
ale
i
could
have
another
one
or
just
as
easily
pass
on
it
cheers

reminds

of
the
red

but
not
quite
as
hoppy
good
hop
flavor
just
not
the
citrus
hop
that
i
like
best
id
buy
again
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
from
a
very
good
brewery
notes
if
you
like
cascade
hops
then
you
need
to
try
this
beer
it
isnt
the
best
amber
ale
you
will
ever
try
but
it
is
near
the
top
of
the
list
especially
if
you
like
this
hop
profile
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
find
myself
enjoying
red
ales
more
and
more
with
each
choice
not
the
best
one
i
have
had
but
i
thoroughly
enjoy
it
would
definitely
buy
again
after
trying
some
others
first
imo
this
is
a
good
cellaring
beer
it
should
get
better
with
age
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
a
little
cascade
hops
and
that
is
about
all
kind
of
weak
but
more
hops
come
through
in
the
flavor
nice
hoppy
elements
of
citrus
and
pine
malt
gives
a
nice
semisweet
backbone
for
the
hops
to
work
off
of
not
just
another
hoppy
onetrick
pony
bitterness
is
moderately
high
no
sign
of
alcohol
a
good
body
and
carbonation
maybe
it
could
use
a
little
more
substance
a
very
good
red
ale
that
has
good
balanced

the
best

mouthfeel
is
suprisingly
creamy
medium
bodied
smooth
and
not
overly
drying
on
the
end
slight
bitter
aftertaste
nice
beer
not
to
complex
and
maybe
just
a
touch
too
bitter
big
hops
and
big
malts
tgether
make
a
pretty
good
beer
d
the
body
of
the
beer
and
the
scent
was
very
impressive
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
well
good
brew
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
redamber
with
a
2
figer
sticky
white
head
big
pine
notes
on
the
aroma
up
front
this
is

bomb

lots

and
piney
back
bone
the
hops
linger
into
the
finish
without
overpowering
cascazilla
is
medium
in
body
and
average
carbonation
a
damn
good
imperial
red
ale
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
the
balance
just
perfect
makes
it
a
refreshing
gulper
of
which
i
do
not
tire
quickly
single
from
the
foodery
nl
philadelphia
i
dont
know
if
i
could
stick
to
these
in
a
session
the
sweetness
is
pretty
high
and
i
think
id
switch
to
something
else
after
a
couple
of
these
the
beer
pours
a
brownishamber
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
with
some
malt
the
aroma
is
subtle
the
flavor
is
orange
pine
and
juicy
citrus
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
an
ambercopper
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
onefinger
khakicolored
head
retained
well
leaving
clingy
and
streaky
lacing
the
aroma
was
nice
a
balance
of
cascade
hops
citruspine
and
caramel
malt
the
flavors
were
huge
and
hoppy
without
being
overwhelming
lots
of
grapefruit
hops
citrus
zest
and
biscuity
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
average
defined
and
yet
sessionable
the
7
was
wellconcealed
a
confusing
red
ale
in
the
sense
that
it
almost
came
off
as
an
apa
or
ipa
but
still
enjoyable
d
i
think
the
name
suggests
something
more
monstrous
than
what
the
beer
delivers
after
a
few
very
solid
offerings
from
ithaca
i
was
a
bit
let
down
in
several
departments
overall
a
quality
brew
but
it
is
clear
that
my
anticipation
got
the
best
of
me
but
hey
a
3
6
aint
bad
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
depth
to
the
hops
but
the
main
player
is
the
pungent
bitterness
which
is
to
strong
and
kicks
you
in
the
teeth
the
malt
backbone
is
good
and
is
a
welcome
addition
as
the
beer
warms
a
nice
hoppy
amber
though
not
a
replacement
for
nugget
nectar
if
you
are
a
true
hophead
d
one
of
the
better
reds
ive
had
of
late
i
dont
tend
to
like
red
ales
or
amber
ales
i
like
everything
stone
has
put
out
except
for
levitation
for
instance
but
i
do
like
this
beer
theres
a
bitterness
to
it
that
i
wish
wasnt
there
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
a
step
above
other
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
tried
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
bed
but
it
isnt
on
the
top
of
my
list
either
taste
is
completely
hops
with
all
the
usual
expectations
that
follow
quite
earth
and
a
finish
that
does
have
a
slight
fruity
nature
this
lines
the
mouth
and
lingers
a
little
syrupy
and
malt
drinkability
is
affected
by
the
dry
hops
the
lack
of
balance
makes
this
a
little
less
enticing
pours
a
cider
like
hazy
color
with
no
head
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
floral
and
earthy
hops
with
a
slight
roasted
malt
deep
roasted
malt
and
caramel
malt
backbone
with
floral
and
earthy
hop
overtones
the
moutfeel
is
light
bodied
the
drinkability
is
good
there
is
a
nice
complexity
and
a
nice
big
malt
taste
followed
on
the
backend
by
a
nice
hop
bite
you
might
not
go
all
night
with
it
but
a
few
is
for
sure
not
out
of
the
question
this
beer
has
somewhat
of
a
cult
following
in
these
parts
so
i
was
excited
to
get
my
hands
on
one
poured
dark
copper
into
an
american
pint
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
fair
lacing
and
fair
carbonation
the
smell
was
somewhat
sickly
sweet
with
pineapple
blood
orange
maple
syrup
plum
and
raisins
all
apparent
the
taste
confirmed
the
smell
very
cloyingly
sweet
from
start
to
finish
with
pineapple
and
maltiness
most
prominent
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
mediumbodied
with
a
good
mix
of
carbonation
given
the
smell
and
flavor
i
expected
the
feel
to
be
more
syrupy
anyway
one
was
enough
for
me
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
all
of
the
hype
a
the
color
reminds
me
of
pine
bark
significant
head
on
a
hard
pour
that
seems
to
stick
around
and
leave
some
lacing
as
it
drops
4

s
wonderfully
fragrant
hop
aroma
lots
of
citrus
especially
grapefruit
which
shouldnt
be
a
shocker
given
the
name
and
implications
that
cascade
hops
play
a
big
part
in
this
beer
theres
also
a
touch
of
molasses
or
brown
sugar
in
the
depths
along
with
a
mild
toastiness

a

edges
more
towards

ways

that
is
certainly
not
a
problem
in
my
book
3
50
12oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
first
off
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
a
red
ale
in
my
opinion
is
the
color
it
seems
ithaca
already
had
an
ipa
but
the
head
brewer
wanted
to
make
another
heavy
hop
bomb
so
he
created
cascazilla
red
ale
color
is
a
copper
red
like
i
think
it
should
be
the
smell
is
all
hops
and
citrus
one
of
the
better
smelling
bears
i
have
had
i
exspected
the
taste
to
be
dominated
by
hops
but
you
can
tell
the
brewer
spent
time
to
balance
this
beer
and
not
make
it
to
bitter
it
has
a
nice
citrus
bite
to
it
but
nothing
to
dominating
like
torpedo
in
my
opinion
mothfeel
is
smooth
with
not
to
much
carbonation
the
alchol
is
masked
very
well
and
i
could
drink
several
of
these
easily
so
far
my
favorite
red
ale
i
have
had
overall
very
malty
and
hoppy
this
1
at
7
is
too
easy
to
drink
d
very
good
and
very
hopppy
red
ale
i
like
this
beer
and
have
had
my
share
glad
to
see
it
on
tap
and
welcome
most
anything
by
ithaca
the
alcohol
is
definitely
not
noticeable
and
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
i
dont
consider
either
of
these
to
be
significant
problems
and
the
beer
just
leaves
me
wanting
more
more
more
this
red
ale
pours
clear
with
a
small
but
noticeable
off
whitish
head
very
heavy
with
cascade
hops
but
at
that
right
point
where
its
enough
without
being
too
much
its
mellowed
off
towards
the
end
by
a
slight
caramel
flavor
but
overall
a
super
crisp
tasting
beer
i
wish
they
made
a
cologne
because
this
beer
smells
fantastic
d
sessionable
brew
here
the
hops
are
the
star
but
like
i
said
before
one
dimensional
d
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
redamber
not
a
rel
standout
i
personally
enjoy
the
malt
biased
ambers
more
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
hoppier
beers
drinkability
its
hard
for
these
to
hang
around
long
they
are
too
drinkable
for
their
own
good
and
they
are
good

mouthfeel

with
a

cleansing
finish
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
on
draft
last
week
and
was
blown
away
by
the
flavor
and
drinkability
truly
a
top
notch

12

along

solid

is
a
solid

one
that
id
recommend
and
will
sample
again
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
all
day
long
d
im
a
big
fan
of
cascade
so
this
was
quite
pleasant
for
me
not
my
favorite
red
but
a
yummy
sipper
bottle
from
an
ithaca
brewing
company
sampler
poured
into
a
sam
smiths
pint
glass
smells
real
friuty
and
florally
a
lot
like
froot
loops
actually
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
very
hoppy
piney
background
club
soda
like
carbonation
and
easy
drinkability
make
this
a
real
nice
beer
almost
sessionable
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
since
i
started
drinking
craft
beers
it
has
a
nice
amber
appearance
and
is
clear
it
has
a
flowery
smell
to
it
and
the
hops
are
just
right
when
you
take
a
drink
it
sits
nicely
on
your
palate
not
to
heavy
and
it
flows
smoothly
i
would
put
this
in
my
top
3
beers
from
this
company
mouthfeel
as
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
nice
drinkability
no
flavors
are
overpowering
and
i
could
drink
several
of
these
without
getting
bored
with
the
flavors
pours
a
kind
of
rusty
amber
with
two
fingers
of
head
huge
flowery
hop
aroma
that
is
almost
overpowering
each
time
i
bring
the
glass
up
to
my
mouth
the
taste
isnt
as
quite
as
hoppy
the
aroma
but
is
still
extremely
strong
slightly
metallic
at
first
but
as
i
continue
through
the
beer
i
become
more
accustomed
to
the
taste
and
it
seems
to
be
better
balanced
fairly
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
okay
it
is
pretty
well
carbonated
but
still
somehow
on
the
thin
side
it
goes
down
quickly
and
smoothly
and
all
the
remains
behind
is
a
citrusrind
bitterness
and
slight
stickiness
it
is
definitely
drinkable
and
while
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
a
nice
imp
amber
but
i
think
troegs
hopback
tastes
better
more
of
a
malt
backbone
and
hop
presence
in
it
cascazilla
has
a
bigger
abv
but
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
i
think
it
could
be
more
ramped
up
and
be
amazing
this
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
rocky
lacing
rather
quickly
the
aroma
presents
a
nice
bready
malt
aroma
backed
nicely
by
citrus
hops
the
taste
follows
with
a
nice
balance
of
the
sweet
biscuit
malt
flavor
and
pine
hop
bitterness
the
medium
body
and
the
good
co2
make
this
a
beer
that
i
never
pass
up
in
the
tasting
room
ithaca
brewing
makes
some
impressive
beer
cascazillas
no
exception
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
its
not
very
bitter
id
like
it
even
more
if
it
had
more
of
a
bitter
kick
to
it
otherwise
its
spoton
for
a
hopped
up
amber
ale
this
is
damn
good
stuff
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
highly
recommended
d
this
brew
is
good
im
not
exactly
impressed
but
it
performs
respectably
in
all
categories
i
wish
there
as
a
little
more
flavor
but
i
guess
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
hop
bomb
i
would
drink
this
again
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
last
but
not
least
this
label
says
stay
away
minus
the
ithaca
beer
co
it
appears
almost
like
a
mighty
morphin
power
ranger
label
with
a
dragon
spewing
fire
out
of
his
mouth
with
hops
in
the
flames
1
for
originality
3
for
label
cheese
taste
is
sweet
and
hoppy
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
but
still
being
sweet
and
drinkable
body
is
a
bit
light
and
watery
although
still
quite
tasty
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
bit
of
a
resinous
malt
feel
in
the
middle
and
end
of
the
sip
nicely
textured
and
thoroughly
interesting
the
only
thing
that
knocks
this
beers
rating
down
a
bit
is
its
representation
of
the
style
not
quite
a
sessioner
7
even
though
youd
never
know
it
but
i
drank
these
all
night
nice
amber
body
topped
by
a
thick
longlasting
head
aroma
is
heavy
on
malt
at
first
then
a
nice
pop
of
rosin
followed
by
another
blast
of
sweetness
flavor
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
grapefruit
and
tangerine
blended
with
pine
balanced
by
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
borders
on
a
typical
ipa
of
810
years
ago
for
bitterness
one
of
the
more
balanced
beers
ive
had
with
regards
not
being
well
hopped
but
not
numbing
to
the
tastebuds
mouthfeel
tends
to
get
a
little
aggressive
carbonationwise
drinkability
is
good
sixpacks
dont
last
too
long
this
has
been
a
goto
dependable
beer
for
a
few
years
for
me
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
an
esb
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
not
a
lot
of
hop
the
hop
flavors
exist
entirely
as
bitterness
and
almost
an
aftertaste
the
malt
character
is
nice
and
although
unexpected
pleasant
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
like
an
esb
drinkablility
high
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
this
is
surely
a
tasty
brew
with
some
nice
raw
hops
flavor
fairly
balanced
by
the
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
and
with
a
pretty
decent
complexity
from
the
355
ml
bottle
with
a
notched
off
september
on
the
label
it
does
not
say
which
year
but
i
sampled
it
on
october
8
2009
so
i
have
to
think
it
is
september
2009
a
decent
sounding
amberred
pour
into
the
pint
glass
with
about
a
quarterinch
long
lasting
beige
head
and
rather
cloudy
in
clarity
the
aroma
wafts
of
very
sweet
malts
and
pungent
cascade
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
with
long
lasting
consistency
the
taste
is
an
enticing
merger
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
bitter
cascade
hops
almost
to
the
level
of
a
decent
ipa
a
nice
spin
on
the
red
ale
recipe
its
a
rough
brew
and
certainly
challenging
to
the
palette
monstrously
hoppy
with
out
being
overbearing
in
anyway
a
genuinely
delicious
brew
drinkability
i
think
is
very
good
the
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
has
a
nice
flavor
the
excessively
bitter
finish
may
turn
some
people
off
drinkability
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
it
almost
seems
a
little
much
for
me
probably
as
far
as
balance
goes
the
strength
of
it
isnt
as
balanced
as
it
probably
should
be
in
order
to
enjoy
a
few
granted
7
isnt
a
low
abv
but
it
seems
a
bit
more
raucous
than
it
should
be
and
with
more
malt
balanced
and
less
askance
bitterness
this
could
be
something
much
different
and
much
more
sessionable
drinkability
its
pretty
drinkable
not
too
heavy
looks
nice
smells
nice
and
even
tastes
nice
the
one
thing
is
that
the
alcohol
really
makes
an
appearance
at
the
bottom
of
your
glass
as
all
the
other
complexities
diminish
overall
quite
an
well
executed
monster
it
doesnt
ruin
your
palate
but
rather
is
a
nice
nuance
of
hops
and
an
interesting
twist
on
the
amber
ale
category
first
time
having
an
ithaca
brew
even
though
they
are
so
close
to
home
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
drink
is
good
very
easily
sessionable
and
again
absolutely
smooth
and
enjoyable
this
is
my
first
time
have
a
beer
made
by
ithaca
beer
company
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
pleasant
surprise
a
totally
drinkable
nicely
balanced
well
made
product
d
this
beer
was
delicious
and
not
your
normal
amber
ale
in
my
book
this
was
an
excellent
drinking
experience
and
i
would
keep
this
in
the
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
in
tn
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
on
tap
like
today
very
bitter
and
hop
forward
with
a
strong
resinous
piney
hop
mouthfeel
caramel
malt
backbone
with
some
biscuit
notes
and
a
slight
touch
of
rye
the
strong
bitterness
of
the
hops
lasts
throughout
lingering
over
the
malt
backbone
into
a
resinous
bone
dry
piney
hop
finish
a
sturdy
drinking
beverage
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
the
abv
is
what
i
as
a
barleywineris
fan
would
consider
on
the
low
side
but
no
matter
who
you
are
you
will
agree
that
the
abv
is
undetectable
in
the
end
i
dont
agree
with
the
claim
of
monstrously
hopped
and
the
lacing
was
huge
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
smells
of
malt
and
hops
tastes
of
citrusy
hops
mixed
with
sweet
malt
flavor
in
a
nice
balance
of
the

certainly
not

switch

this

just
plain

not
sessionable
due
to
the

which
is

for
me
to

ok
better

out
there
this
ale
had
a
beautiful
appearance
the
other
aspects
werent
as
wonderful
but
the
only
disappointing
part
was
the
mouthfeel
there
was
an
arid
level
of
dryness
that
i
didnt
care
for
but
dont
let
that
keep
you
from
drinking
it
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
very
similar
in
taste
and
aroma
to
a
barleywine
without
all
the
alcohol
wasnt
sure
i
liked
it
at
first
but
it
really
started
to
get
tasty

a

that
i
would
like
to
try
again
in
the
future
flavor
is
just
popping
with
hops
malts
provide
a
balance
to
the
hops
but
hardly
stand
out
on
their
own
some
stringent
woody
tannins
to
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
hop
oils
really
cling
to
the
cheeks
drinkable
but
3
or
so
of
these
would
blow
your
taste
buds
for
much
else
i
just
recently
had
this
beer
on
tap
also
and
it
is
even
better
and
smoother
than
a
bottle
drinkability
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
it
has
some
balls
yet
its
still
easydrinking
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
what
impressed
me
was
that
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
an
easy
drinking
hoppy
ale
that
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
with
the
hops
them
cram
them
into
your
unconcious
mouth
i
will
most
certainly
be
enjoying
more
of
these
in
the
future
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
which
works
down
quickly
leaving
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
grass
and
piny
hops
the
flavor
is
on
the
hoppy
side
but
nat
as
overpowering
as
some
of
the
style
a
good
amount
of
citrus
hops
followed
by
some
medium
malt
backbone
and
a
lingering
grapefruit
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
for
the
beer
and
this
one
tends
to
be
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
a
good
hoppy
red
ale
cheers
the
beer
poured
a
redtinged
brown
with
a
single
finger
tan
head
the
nose
was
mostly
hops
with
some
fruity
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
all
cascade
hops
with
the
distinct
tastes
of
pine
and
grapefruit
without
as
much
of
a
bite
as
i
expected
it
has
a
decently
smooth
almost
oily
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
thats
so
hoppy
cascade
hops
surprise
surprise
it
is
a
very
focused
beer
the
nose
and
mouth
are
almost
souly
about
the
cascade
but
it
deviates
slightly
to
showcase
some
caramel
biscuity
malt
and
bread
dough
and
then
all
is
washed
over
again
by
cascade
hop
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
pine
i
am
just
not
a
very
big
fan
of
red
ales
and
that
might
be
the
case
of
the
poor
review
but
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
and
will
not
be
having
it
again
this
beer
is
dirty
red
in
apperance
with
a
slight
chill
haze
there
a
bit
of
a
malty
sent
but
the
malt
is
fighting
off
the
hops
the
whole
time
this
beer
has
a
robust
resiny
body
where
you
can
just
taste
the
citrusy
resins
other
flavors
you
get
are
a
grassy
aroma
with
lemon
and
peper
it
also
appears
by
the
label
that
there
showcasing
the
cascade
hops
if
so
they
did
a
good
job
good
for
hop
heads
i
just
look
for
more
malts
from
an
amber
or
red
also
evean
though
its
not
beer
but
on
the
bottle
the
lable
is
hidiously
kitchy
drinkability
this
is
the
best
hoppy
red
ale
i
have
tried
the
balance
is
what
makes
this
so
good
since
many
can
go
too
heavy
on
the
hoppy
side
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
good
job
d
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
ithaca
beer
its
like
an
ipa
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
d
pretty
good
a
pleasantly
hoppy
ale
thats
worth
a
try
it
is
flavorful
and
pleasant
i
might
have
it
again
the
great
smell
taste
and
easy
drinking
of
this
guy
make
this
a
winner
in
my
book
next
time
ill
pick
up
a
six
pack
instead
of
just
the
one
single
this
went
down
way
too
fast
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
red
tint
with
a
nice
medium
sized
white
head
that
is
fairly
thick
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
bottle
the
smell
is
of
hops
and
some
roasted
malts
but
mostly
cascade
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
red
ale
with
alot
of
hops
good
roasted
malts
followed
by
a
citrisy
flowery
bitter
hop
flavor
to
finish
it
off
pretty
refreshing
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
good
mouthfeel
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
pours
a
clear
but
fairly
dark
ruby
with
some
tan
head
nose
is
sticky
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
flavor
is
smooth
with
slightly
firm
hops
with
a
sweet
tone
touch
of
wood
there
as
well
a
hint
of
bitter
on
the
edge
feel
is
nice
with
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
good
with
the
liquid
feel
too
overall
very
drinkable
a
smooth
and
even
red
ale
well
worth
trying
just
not
an
overly
inventive
beer
d
alhrabosky
was
kind
enough
to
give
me
this
one
and
now
i
want
a
lot
more
ill
try
this
next
to
nugget
nectar
in
a
few
months
cheers
scott
i
had
this
beer
two
days
later
ontap
at
red
bones
in
davis
sq
in
somerville
ma
this
beer
is
very
good
and
i
would
add
some
overall
points
to
the
beer
the
dry
maltish
backbone
very
much
complements
this
beer
and
the
piney
hop
resin
notes
do
come
through
quite
nicely
there
is
also
more
of
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
the
beer
on
tap
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
for
6
5
abv
however
like
all
hoppy
beers
its
better
to
drink
this
one
fresh
i
originally
wanted
to
try
this
beer
based
upon
an
ad
in
some
beer
magazine
marketing
works
i
like
the
label
with
a
lizard
breathing
fire
and
red
hops
cool
name
too
i
assume
this
is
heavily
hopped
with
cascades
based
upon
the
name
the
color
id
a
nice
orange
red
it
has
a
very
nice
malty
and
hoppy
smell
like
a
good
barleywine
almost
the
taste
is
chewy
some
malts
and
finishes
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
is
quite
enjoyable
thanks
to
wasatch
for
the
trade
this
is
enjoyable
d
definitely
a
hopheads
beer
i
had
one
and
i
need
no
more
the
hops
actually
were
not
as
overwhelming
as
you
would
think
i
have
had
better
beers
from
ithaca
d
quite
drinkable
red
ale
with
a
nice
hop
profile
thats
not
overbearing
i
tried
this
beer
at
the
harrisburg
brewers
fest
which
led
me
to
seek
out
this
offering
from
ithaca
its
quite
tasty
and
wellbalanced
though
not
quite
the
hop
monster
as
i
was
expecting
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
yeah
ill
be
passing
on
this
one
from
now
on
i
suppose
its
decent
but
there
is
much
better
available
d
the
abv
is
apparent
but
it
doesnt
diminish
the
strength
of
the
beer
this
is
another
nice
hopped
up
red
ale
in
the
same
mold
as
nugget
nectar
cheers
notes
i
really
like
the
ipared
ale
combo
i
love
the
idea
of
giving
the
hops
something
to
really
play
with
i
just
wish
this
had
a
bit
more
malt
character
this
might
benefit
from
a
category
change
or
addition
that
being
said
ill
be
getting
a
few
friends
turned
on
to
this
one
a
decent
beer
overall
technical
details
do
take
away
too
much
from
drinkability
and
enjoyment
of
the
brew
went
from
the
ithaca
apricot
wheat
to
the
cascazilla
and
i
might
just
say
wow
medium
copper
amber
color
hidden
uinderneath
a
fluffy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
but
left
behind
some
exceptional
lacing
this
brew
would
fool
you
if
it
wasnt
for
the
label
smell
and
taste
mimick
that
of
a
quality
ipa
pine
and
grapefruit
aromas
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
good
mouthfeel
creamy
and
alittle
oily
a
really
good
beer
i
want
more
d
a
quality
ale
appealing
to
the
eye
and
nostrils
a
very
tasty
cascade
flavor
and
bitterness
great
w
fish
and
chips
the
red
ale
cuts
through
the
grease
and
really
refreshes
w
citrus
and
bittering
qualities
the
carbonation
level
and
feel
really
benefit
the
overall
taste
and
sessionability
is
high
after
the
first
two
i
was
still
craving
more
pours
a
nice
tawny
copper
color
with
a
twofingered
light
beige
head
that
lasts
for
a
good
half
minute
decent
lacing
aroma
is
predominantly
piney
and
citrusy
hops
but
you
can
sense
a
underlying
caramelly
malt
backbone
to
the
ale
the
malt
comes
through
in
the
flavor
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
is
complemented
nicely
with
a
decent
bite
from
the
hops
a
faint
bit
of
berry
at
the
tail
end
of
the
sip
a
moderately
dry
finish
maybe
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
im
not
put
off
by
it
i
find
it
hard
sometimes
to
get
really
get
into
red
ales
but
this
ones
really
good
provided
youre
a
fan
of
the
hop
ive
had
it
ondraught
as
well
and
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
at
a
better
level
than
that
of
the
bottle
smooth
mouthfeel
yet
the
hop
creates
a
nice
contrary
bite
i
hate
giving
straight
scores
but
this
beer
merits
the
consistancy
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
easy
to
drink
and
is
good
in
all
characteristics
poured
into
a
draft
glass
a
deep
redish
amber
with
a
fair
1
finger
head
head
disappeared
relatively
quick
leaving
little
lacing
throughout
scent
is
a
slightly
citrus
revealing
a
hint
of
piney
shadowing
taste
is
definately
up
my
alley
nice
citrus
grass
and
pine
balance
very
pleasing
to
have
such
a
nice
hoppy
bite
in
a
red
ale
if
you
are
a
hophead
and
also
fond
of
red
ales
and
you
havent
had
this
one
try
it
pours
clear
and
a
moderately
dark
amber
color
with
less
than
a
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
without
much
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
and
strong
a
rich
caramel
malty
sweetness
almost
syrupy
with
a
less
prevalent
floral
hop
character
medium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
with
a
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
far
from
a
hopbomb
that
the
zilla
leads
on
to
be
full
flavored
the
mouth
and
the
nose
are
quite
similar
taste
is
malty
but
with
less
caramel
than
the
nose
with
a
measured
citrus
hop
character
my
tastes
have
really
changed
and
my
memory
is
slipping
my
first
experience
was
draft
and
i
remember
thinking
it
had
more
of
a
hoppiness
to
it
im
glad
that
i
pulled
this
one
off
the
shelf
i
plan
on
snagging
a
sixer
or
growler
next
opportunity
at
the
brewery
nice
bronze
color
with
the
slightest
of
a
red
tint
thin
white
cap
that
leaves
some
thin
trails
of
lace
smell
is
very
hoppy
some
citrus
but
mostly
piney
taste
the
same
as
smell
with
the
hops
continuing
to
dominate
in
my
opinion
the
hops
is
a
little
overdone
and
becomes
somewhat
metalic
as
you
drink
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
overall
this
beer
is
what
it
says
its
going
to
be
a
blast
of
hops
while
i
love
a
well
done
hop
bomb
this
one
just
dosnt
have
enough
balance
to
really
make
me
exited
about
it
its
good
but
just
not
great
a
hopheads
beer
id
have
to
say
part
of
an
assortment
12pack
4
different
ithaca
brews
i
pickedup
at
the
beer
zoo
outside
hershey
pa
hopheads
rejoice
your
perfect
beer
has
arrived
gorgeous
redbrown
color
with
thick
foamy
head
citrus
of
hops
present
in
the
smell
nice
carbonation
that
you
notice
when
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
and
then
the
hops
kick
in
wow
amazing
flavor
but
a
little
much
for
any
but
the
most
serious
hops
lover
i
noticed
that
after
swallowing
i
could
open
my
mouth
and
the
saliva
glands
were
still
pumping
like
crazy
flavorzilla
beware
but
enjoy
the
taste
is
smooth
malty
but
it
lacks
more
flavor
than
that
this
was
a
nice
first
beer
to
try
from
ithaca
its
a
hoppy
red
ale
with
a
lot
of
flavour
thats
well
balanced
with
the
malt
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
again
and
often
at
that
definitely
worth
a
try
nice
somewhat
muted
orange
in
color
quite
foamy
at
first
low
aromai
was
expecting
more
somewhat
grassy
and
citrusy
big
cascade
flavor
though
not
as
pronounced
as
i
had
thought
it
would
have
nice
mellow
malt
sweetness
good
hop
bite
in
the
finish
i
am
thinking
nugget
nectars
little
brother
good
body
very
drinkable
beer
not
as
pronounced
as
say
sn
celebration
however
having
been
blasted
by
hops
so
much
recently
it
is
nice
to
see
a
regular
pale
ale
with
a
liberal
but
sensible
dose
of
hops
not
too
shabby
pours
an
amber
red
tone
forms
thick
creamy
textured
light
beige
head
that
lasts
for
a
good
while
before
settling
specks
of
lacing
all
around
the
pint
glass
aroma
contains
deep
pine
with
tree
bar
accents
and
a
flow
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
coming
my
way
also
a
flowery
herbal
essence
with
a
noticeable
light
caramel
malt
presence
just
barely
peeking
through
flavors
upfront
with
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
more
pine
tree
bark
earthy
floral
tones
as
well
and
yes
the
grapefruit
appeal
seeks
through
as
well
barely
any
maltiness
to
balance
out
the
aggressive
nature
of
the
hop
additions
this
brew
has
to
offer
bitterness
comes
of
somewhat
one
dimensional
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
in
the
light
to
medium
body
range
pretty
thin
actually
for
all
of
the
hop
character
this
brew
has
to
offer
i
was
expecting
more
oily
textures
and
carbonation
packs
a
spritzy
zing
as
well
not
as
moderate
as
i
would
prefer
from
a
brew
like
this
drinkability
is
decent
but
i
would
get
bored
with
no
interplay
between
malt
and
hops
the
bitterness
really
lacquers
onto
the
old
palate
and
i
could
definitely
go
for
some
more
balance
here
decent
overall
worth
a
try
of
course
pours
a
dark
amber
red
color
with
not
to
much
head
i
can
smell
the
hops
from
here
big
hop
aroma
and
some
sweetness
with
it
it
has
a
nice
flavor
big
hop
kinda
sticky
sweet
but
in
a
good
way
can
this
be
i
am
starting
to
like
red
ales
although
there
are
tons
of
hops
in
it
d
its
interesting
its
complex
i
would
love
to
have
more
malt
flavor
in
this
beer
but
it
is
sort
of
a
toned
down
ipa
which
i
think
would
be
great
for
some
occasions
pours
a
deep
cleanclear
dark

of
sticky

the
nose

hoppy
slightly
piney

nice
touch

drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
amber
ale
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
it
highly
recommended
on
tap
at
the
4th
ave
pub
a
beautiful
pour
crimsonruby
with
a
solid
offwhite
head
wellretained
with
rings
and
lace
smelled
strongly
of
cascade
hops
grapefruit
and
pine
matched
exquisitely
with
sweet
bready
malts
tasted
much
the
same
well
balanced
with
the
sweets
up
front
and
the
hops
providing
a
crisp
slightly
bitter
finish
nice
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
a
very
impressive
showing
from
ithaca
on
a
beer
that
could
be
formulaic
my
new
standard
for
hoppy
red
ales
overall
its
a
very
nicely
balanced
and
wellrounded
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
drinkability
very
nicely
done
d
if
you
can
handle
the
bitter
hop
blasts
this
is
a
beer
you
could
put
a
few
back
in
a
sitting
cascazilla
pours
an
orange
amber
with
a
quickly
dissppearing
head
aroma
is
big
and
hoppy
but
there
is
also
a
sweet
fruity
malt
smell
flavor
is
all
hops
upfront
tastes
like
im
chewing
on
a
fresh
cone
the
cascade
hops
make
themselves
obvious
citrusy
and
slightly
herbal
for
all
the
hop
flavor
the
bitterness
is
nice
and
well
rounded
and
it
goes
well
with
the
malt
flavor
a
nice
hoppy
take
on
the
american
red
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
those
who
love
hops
and
i
am
one
the
different
base
for
the
hops
red
ale
vs
ipa
throws
a
curve
but
is
well
worth
finding
and
drinking
can
wait
for
my
next
trip
to
the
area
to
get
a
case
of
the
stuff
excellent
since
my
review
the
losest
review
is
a
3
9
that
is
pretty
good
lots
of
raves
on
this
beer
love
the
beer
label
poured
a
clear
brownish
red
into
a
pint
glass
straightforward
grapefruit
aroma
strong
citrus
hops
and
some
mild
floral
elements
taste
was
surprisingly
well
balanced
considering
the
hopemphasis
on
the
label
tasty
cascade
hops
with
great
bready
malt
backbone
clean
tangy
citrus
aftertaste
and
a
solid
mouthfeel
round
out
this
very
well
done
red
ale
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
anytime
well
done
mediumthick
and
creamy
very
smooth
milky
its
an
outstanding
drink
hops
are
delicious
but
they
dont
ruin
the
taste
buds
let
this
one
warm
folks
i
should
also
add
that
i
found
this
at
a
gas
station
in
watertown
ny
while
visiting
my
brother
what
a
gem
its
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
all
in
all
cascazilla
is
a
great
beer
for
anyone
in
love
with
hops
but
doesnt
like
the
high
alcohol
that
tends
to
accompany
highly
hopped
brews
a
hoppy
red
significant
whitish
beige
head
on
brownish

hoppy
aroma
including
c
hopn
and
other
hops
above
average
carbonated
very
bitter
not
balanced
thin
mouthfeel
not
satisfying
acidic
citrus
finish
although
some
caramel
in
there
tatebuds
demolished
pours
with
nice
big
round
bubbles
froathy
head
that
would
settle
slightly
from
an
initial
twofinger
level
clear
body
deep
copper
colour
a
fine
hoppy
aroma
smells
nice
and
fresh
green
hops
with
plenty
of
citruis
notes
a
nice
mouthfeel
void
of
alcohol
but
also
seemingly
absent
is
the
hops
they
just
dont
show
up
in
the
flavour
like
they
did
in
the
aroma
a
serious
lack
of
bitterness
serious
lack
little
breadyness
the
beer
has
malt
but
its
nothing
exciting
or
overly
tasty
while
some
of
the
aroma
hops
comes
through
a
little
the
malts
do
nothing
do
contribute
to
the
flavour
all
it
seems
to
do
is
hold
up
the
hops
actually
it
seems
to
take
away
from
them
and
work
against
the
beer
a
very
nice
enjoyable
beer
cascazilla
is
a
good
name
for
this
beer
because
of
its
monstrous
taste
a
great
blend
of
tastes
its
a
a
red
ale
with
a
hoopy
middle
and
a
caramel
finish
its
pours
nicely
and
has
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
just
looking
at
it
you
know
its
going
to
be
good
ive
had
it
both
in
a
bottle
and
on
tap
and
i
would
recommend
either
again
not
the
hop
monster
that
it
advertises
itself
to
be
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
comments
the
bottle
describes
this
as
a
monstously
hoppy
red
ale
that
is
right
on
the
money
this
has
been
the
best
red
ale
ive
tried
to
date
very
good
bold
flavors
in
perfect
balance
only
downside
is
the
lack
of
aroma
medium
bodied
tongue
coating
bubbly
and
refreshing
overall
an
excellent
brew
even
with
some
age
on
it
hopefully
i
can
find
some
more
of
these
i
will
be
looking
into
ithaca
beer
for
my
store
and
am
now
even
more
excited
about
my
trip
to
ithaca
next
month
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
theres
a
good
kick
to
it
this
beer
has
all
of
the
qualities
that
make
it
a
good
one
to
stick
with
for
the
duration
of
an
evening
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
red
hue
thin
headgood
retentionand
lacing
was
very
good
smell
is
malty
but
yet
has
an
earthy
hop
sent
as
well
body
is
medium
with
some
carbionation
taste
is
very
much
like
an
ipa
malt
but
with
a
good
balance
of
citrus
hops
this
beer
was
put
in
a
six
pack
of
partly
sunny
i
bought
in
july
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
this
was
on
tap
as
well
at
reds
in
seneca
falls
if
youre
expecting
a
normal
red
ale
youre
in
for
a
surprise
this
brew
has
a
very
generous
amount
of
hops
which
makes
it
almost
like
an
ipa
color
is
a
golden
red
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
smell
is
hoppycitrusy
taste
is
bitter
due
to
the
hops
with
some
sweetness
as
well
due
to
the
caramel
malt
definitely
a
unique
ale
give
this
one
a
try
poured
chilled
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
ruby
tint
a
twofinger
high
frothy
head
sits
atop
of
the
body
after
sustaining
itself
for
a
few
minutes
the
head
leaves
behind
a
clingy
white
surface
layer
with
soem
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
of
hops
on
my
nose
first
but
followed
by
some
slight
fruity
malts
and
a
hint
of
toasted
almonds
sweet
caramel
hits
my
tastebuds
first
with
a
resinhop
flavor
following
that
helps
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
maybe
some
slight
fruit
in
there
but
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
although
this
beer
was
rather
sweet
a
constant
bitterness
lays
in
the
weeds
and
sneaks
in
throughout
helping
the
balance
without
it
itd
be
too
sweet
really
mouthfeel
is
solid
for
the
style
prickly
carbonation
as
expected
hits
my
tongue
with
a
medium
body
maybe
a
bit
of
alcohol
detected
as
well
drinkability
is
solid
and
it
is
a
tasty
brew
but
it
may
be
just
a
bit
too
sweet
drink
more
than
a
bottle
or
two
with
a
little
more
zilla
hops
this
one
would
balance
better
and
be
a
ridiculously
drinkable
brew
still
try
it
im
glad
the
beer
matched
the
bottle
a
nice
reddish
orange
and
little
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
there
is
a
slight
cinnamon
touch
as
well
the
taste
is
bitter
and
there
is
a
hoppy
aftertaste
that
last
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
hoppinsee
makes
this
beer
a
pleasure
to
consume
if
this
beer
was
more
readily
available
i
would
bring
it
home
more
often
the
abv
also
shows
itself
a
little
bit
d
very
good
nice
balance
of
flavors
but
with
hops
dominating
in
the
end
just
as
i
like
it
im
not
a
big
red
ale
fan
but
when
its
rediculously
hopped
im
all
over
it
the
taste
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
great
hopped
character
its
not
bitter
at
all
which
is
always
a
good
thing
overall
its
a
great
beer
with
a
great
taste
if
you
like
hoppy
this
is
for
you
this
is
the
hoppiest
red
ale
that
ive
ever
tasted
i
love
the
malthop
balance
if
you
are
expecting
a
killians
red
youll
be
shocked
by
cascazilla
its
a
nice
crisp
beer
that
smells
as
good
as
it
tastes
i
have
rarely
seen
it
on
tap
its
mostly
found
in
bottlescases
i
have
tried
nearly
every
ithaca
beer
made
and
this
is
my
favorite
i
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
in
massachusetts
drinkability
i
like
it
and
if
it
were
distributed
here
would
make
it
a
regular
very
sessionable
pours
reddish
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
with
a
fair
lacing
to
the
finish
honey
fruity
hoppy
smell
taste
is
caramel
honey
bready
with
hoppy
ending
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
with
the
hop
lingering
on
nice
beer
i
would
put
it
on
my
buy
list
pours
a
dark
red
clear
with
bubbles
cascading
leaving
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
strong
floural
hops
honey
grapefruit
grassy
earthy
notes
the
taste
is
very
smooth
the
perfect
combination
of
malty
red
ale
hopped
up
to
give
it
that
nice
bite
this
is
a
fantastic
combo
featuring
honey
low
carbonation
citrus
toffee
and
makes
it
session
quality
take
the
maltiness
of
a
good
red
ale
and
mix
it
with
the
bite
of
hops
i
dig
the
concept
this
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
mediumlarge
ammount
of
tan
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
leaving
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
interior
aroma
is
deep
brassy
and
malty
this
beer
is
hoppy
and
i
like
it
slainte
finally
decided
to
give
this
brew
a
try
today
was
i
afraid
of
the
cascazilla
nah
just
for
some
reason
have
not
had
the
ithaca
brews
in
a
long
time
the
brew
poured
to
a
rust
color
with
a
medium
sized
light
tan
head
while
leaving
a
nice
amount
of
lace
at
the
top
of
the
glass
a
fairly
impressive
looking
brew
the
aroma
has
a
very
enticing
hop
smell
citrus
grapefruit
that
dominates
but
i
am
able
to
pick
up
a
nice
malt
toasted
and
caramel
scent
in
the
background
the
taste
is
actually
quite
smooth
for
such
a
hoppy
brew
actually
the
hop
is
not
over
the
top
but
is
clearly
strong
and
dominant
picking
up
a
nice
malt
taste
that
has
a
sweet
feel
and
goes
well
with
the
hops
with
this
being
a
red
ale
as
highlighted
on
the
bottle
i
guess
i
would
expect
to
notice
the
malt
a
bit
more
and
it
is
there
over
all
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
not
sure
it
lives
up
to
its
name
as
cascazilla
but
is
a
great
drink
one
that
i
would
grab
at
anytime
this
beer
is
awesome
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
me
and
my
friend
could
smell
the
hoppy
aroma
this
is
the
best
red
ale
ive
ever
had
its
smooth
and
well
balanced
however
i
couldnt
taste
any
malts
there
was
also
a
fruity
flavor
that
i
couldnt
figure
out
hell
yea
d
might
be
my
favorite
red
ale
yup
it
is
drinkability
is
low
because
while
it
tastes
good
i
fear
two
would
numb
the
tastebuds
with
all
the
hops
ive
been
comparing
pale
ales
around
the
country
this
past
summer
and
bought
this
for
its
monster
dose
of
hops
cascazilla
has
the
hops
and
nose
to
compare
tosay
pyramid
brewerys
thunderhead
ipa
but
without
the
dryness
i
think
your
sister
would
like
it
decent
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
id
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
crisp
this
up
a
bit
drinkability
is
good
fairly
filling
beer
which
limits
how
many
i
would
have
in
a
sitting
but
good
flavor
and
aroma
would
make
me
have
one
of
these
every
now
and
then
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
by
this
choice
a
total
darkhorse
when
i
purchased
it
tasty
and
easy
enough
to
drink
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
a
lot
of
folks
didnt
get
much
head
from
this
beer
mine
poured
with
a
huge
cloudlike
head
that
stuck
around
for
the
duration
left
lacy
patches
of
sticky
foam
down
the
side
of
the
glass
mild
floral
hop
aroma
dominates
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
mellow
malt
backbone
just
a
hint
of
balancing
sweetness
really
a
rather
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
i
could
probably
session
a
few
of
these
pretty
easily
i
think
ithaca
has
crafted
a
great
beer
here
awesome
job
combining
the
characteristics
of
a
red
ale
and
an
ipa
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
had
in
years
the
hoppy
taste
without
the
bitterness
is
incredible
a
great
session
brew
for
hop
heads
like
myself
you
know
as
soon
as
you
smell
this
that
its
gonna
be
good
and
i
dont
just
mean
for
hopheads
smell
is
all
hops
but
delivered
in
a
subtle
manner
what
a
fine
pale
ale
the
taste
is
excellent
too
as
it
has
some
good
maltiness
up
front
followed
by
woody
hops
character
nothing
that
bites
very
sharply
but
still
is
apprent
that
this
is
a
very
american
style
pale
ale
i
like
it
a
lot
i
see
it
has
been
labeled
as
an
amberi
stand
by
my
earlier
impresions
for
drinkability
quite
excellent
also
colors
range
from
a
goldenyellow
at
the
stem
of
the
glass
up
to
a
firery
auburn
at
the
surface
topped
with
a
tan
ring
of
foam
grapefruit
citrus
with
piney
hops
in
aroma
more
earthty
hops
in
the
taste
followed
by
a
sweet
fruity
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
but
overall
very
refreshing
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
regular
plenty
of
hop
character
not
too
sweet
and
a
modest
amount
of
alcohol
thanks
to
nutbrown
for
including
this
wonderful
nectar
in
our
trade
what
a
surprise
this
was
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
it
when
i
bought
it
poured
a
bright
shiny
copper
color
and
extremely
clear
formed
a
34
inch
head
which
quickly
dissipated
leaving
behind
little
to
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
is
what
initially
blew
me
away
wow
extreme
grapefruit
sweet
malts
maltball
candies
extremely
floral
aroma
then
the
sipping
began
and
again
a
bright
smile
shone
across
my
face
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
sweet
maltiness
with
cascade
hops
all
over
the
place
grapefruit
piney
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
comparable
to
a
dfh
90minute
ipa
light
would
be
a
good
description
extremely
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
velvety
body
ending
a
bit
dry
the
carbonation
is
somwhere
between
light
and
medium
just
enough
to
be
subdued
but
enough
to
be
noticed
as
well
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
sixpack
up
on
a
blind
whim
and
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
it
in
the
future
ill
have
to
try
out
the
other
ithaca
brews
as
well
well
done
this
is
a
pretty
good
hoppy
treat
nothing
mindblowing
basically
a
shitton
of
cascades
packed
into
a
bottle
cascazilla
indeed
d
well
this
is
a
nice
beer
im
finding
that
i
like
these
bitter
ambers
more
and
more
good
for
malt
lovers
and
hop
heads
roasted
nut
flavor
characteristic
and
not
a
whole
lot
more
how
can
you
make
a
beer
called
cascazilla
touting
the
cascade
hops
have
a
picture
of
hops
on
your
label
and
not
bring
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
week
and
insipid
and
finish
has
a
somewhat
soapy
taste
to
it
not
sure
what
ithaca
beer
intended
with
this
one
but
they
failed
d
good
offering
from
ithaca
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
very
hoppy
rye
ale
probably
would
be
good
on
cask
with
more
of
a
resiny
oily
flavor
coming
through
taste
is
fruity
hoppy
with
dry
citrus
flavors
and
long
finish
its
a
very
refreshing
beer
very
drinkable
and
can
be
served
cold
without
giving
up
too
much
flavor
drinkability
very
quaffable
one
of
the
better
beers
from
ithaca
beer
taste
is
hoppy
without
high
bitterness
leafy
but
mild
ruby
red
grapefruit
leads
out
with
a
medium
biscuity
body
taking
over
slightly
dry
finish
regardless
of
the
name
this
is
no
hop
monster
rather
just
a
nice
red
ale
with
a
good
deal
of
leafy
and
grapefruit
hop
flavor
up
front
balancedzilla
might
be
more
like
it
d
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
regardless
of
season
a
wonderful
beer
ultimately
drinkability
comes
down
to
hop
appreciation
with
this
one
i
could
have
a
couple
the
mouth
is
sturdy
and
the
beer
has
good
active
carbonation
this
went
well
with
my
bbq
and
was
able
to
cut
the
heat
of
some
of
the
spicier
offerings
well
done
5
a
glass
obviously
red
body
with
a
healthy
head
small
lacing
nothing
great
average
a
nice
blast
of
hops
on
the
nose
and
tongue
i
find
this
beer
exceptionally
average
a
good
craft
beer
that
falls
into
the
ba
realm
of
3
54
0
rating
of
a
mediocre
craft
beer
this
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
large
tan
foamy
head
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
the
smell
is
a
real
citrus
and
hoppy
aroma
thats
very
strong
the
taste
is
strong
with
hops
for
a
red
ale
this
is
an
ipa
to
me
the
hops
are
really
overblown
on
this
beeri
like
the
tastebut
its
not
really
a
up
to
the
style
the
mf
is
light
with
the
flavors
mixing
pretty
wellbut
the
malt
and
hops
are
a
little
off
this
is
a
decent
beerunusual
but
good
id
have
this
againbut
how
about
calling
this
what
it
is
an
ipa
crux
good
hoppy
red
ale
everyday
drinker
why
they
dont
just
call
it
an
ipa
is
baffling
to
me
but
then
many
things
are
oh
well
wish
i
could
get
say
red
seal
ale
by
north
coast
brewing
around
here
until
then
this
will
do
the
drinkability
was
average
taste
presents
plenty
of
malt
up
front
commingled
with
pine
and
grapefruit
quite
well
balanced
in
fact
low
bitterness
for
the
amount
of
hop
flavor
and
a
pleasant
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
through
the
middle
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
all
around
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
finish
left
me
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
and
mild
lingering
hop
flavor
although
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
either
monstrous
or
red
it
is
a
good
tasty
almost
sessionable
brew
and
worth
trying
pour
an
amber
copper
with
an
initially
large
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
floral
hops
are
the
main
aroma
not
overpowering
just
right
a
hint
of
malt
starts
on
the
front
exploding
into
a
nice
hoppy
presence
that
satys
throughout
bitterness
is
just
about
right
very
smooth
yet
with
a
bitter
finish
that
is
just
right
smoothness
as
menytioned
before
yet
with
a
nice
hop
finsih
one
of
the
hoppiest
beers
i
have
had
lately
although
not
to
hoppy
to
take
away
from
the
overall
flavor
that
is
what
you
get
with
the
cascade
hops
the
taste
in
your
mouth
is
unbelievable
the
caramel
malts
really
come
out
too
although
it
is
a
red
ale
it
was
not
overly
red
and
not
a
flavor
that
you
would
associate
with
one
musings
this
is
not
a
monstrously
hopped
beer
at
least
the
flavor
spectrum
doesnt
turn
that
way
let
it
warm
slightly
and
you
will
be
rewarded
great
tastes
combos
and
feel
will
bring
you
home
came
to
the
table
a
deep
copper
with
a
slight
chilled
haze
a
thinner
but
well
retained
white
head
nice
intermingling
of
caramel
malt
and
healthy
dose
of
those
cascades
with
the
cascades
holding
a
slight
edge
caramel
malt
hits
up
front
with
some
doughy
notes
but
the
big
pine
and
grapefruit
character
comes
thru
to
dominate
into
a
long
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
packed
withat
cascade
goodnessi
went
picked
up
a
couple
of
sixers
after
having
this
this
is
an
enjoyable
hoppy
red
ale
that
you
dont
see
to
often
this
is
a
red
ale
alright
mostly
red
with
brownish
hints
and
a
solid
looking
body
as
you
can
imagine
based
on
the
name
there
are
a
terrific
amount
of
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
nice
surprise
balanced
yet
hoppy
as
hell
i
like
the
fact
that
you
can
taste
the
hops
here
instead
of
just
heavily
bittered
ale
the
flavor
and
aroma
tell
me
ibc
is
using
a
bunch
of
hops
at
the
end
of
boil
and
or
dry
hopping
either
way
the
effect
is
tasty
a
decent
body
as
i
mentioned
before
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
d
easy
drinking
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
hints
of
sweetsour
fruit
made
it
unique
to
me
if
youre
from
the
right
coast
and
youve
spent
your
life
drinking
rightcoast
beers
well
yeah
ok
im
not
even
from
the
right
coast
but
i
hated
this
beer
to
begin
with
its
about
the
cascades
man
your
typical
mainenew
hamsterma
brewery
just
doesnt
use
em
and
why
should
they
well
this
beer
does
and
taking
it
after
years
of
not
drinking
a
single
beer
with
cascades
in
it
well
was
very
harsh
even
then
i
acknowledged
how
well
it
was
made
i
just
couldnt
appreciate
the
flavor
well
let
me
tell
you
now
i
can
and
its
awfully
good
clear
orangey
copper
colored
with
a
thick
anf
frothy
while
head
that
sits
up
high
and
sticks
around
for
most
of
the
experience
sharp
aroma
of
tangerine
rind
some
piney
notes
but
no
malt
flavor
is
hoppy
upfront
tingly
and
crisp
mostly
of
tangy
citrus
peel
and
grapefruit
some
pine
some
sweet
malts
arise
in
the
finish
but
struggle
to
bust
through
the
stronger
hop
profile
a
bitter
citrus
peel
lingers
even
mouthfeel
but
not
too
full
pretty
hoppy
for
a
red
ale
and
i
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
a
little
out
of
balance
for
the
style
since
the
malt
presence
is
very
understated
a
decent
selection
though
id
have
it
again
great
name
for
a
beer
pours
a
beautiful
bronze
with
a
thick
appetizing
head
the
nose
contains
that
familiar
cascade
grapefruit
and
some
pine
in
a
huge
hop
nose
theres
also
some
nutty
malt
aromas
underneath
the
hops
as
would
be
expected
fruity
hop
notes
dominant
the
taste
of
cascazilla
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
slight
sweetness
at
the
front
of
the
palate
and
a
huge
bitterness
at
the
back
one
nice
twist
this
beer
has
is
the
caramel
malt
being
a
red
ale
which
provides
a
nice
undertone
to
the
hops
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
acidic
not
the
most
acidic
beer
ive
had
but
quite
acidic
nonetheless
this
is
the
main
drawback
with
this
beer
its
high
acidity
reduces
the
drinkability
for
me
and
makes
it
unlikely
that
id
want
to
order
a
bunch
of
these
transparent
bronze
with
thich
ecru
froth
green
cascade
blast
to
my
nostrils
astringent
pineyness
not
too
citrusy
the
aroma
is
almost
chemical
kind
of
like
new
carpet
grapefruit
pith
and
pine
needle
flavor
and
thats
about
it
any
malt
is
completely
mia
slight
peach
juice
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
body
juicy
and
quenching
none
too
complex
but
id
pick
this
up
again
if
i
really
wanted
hops
and
nothing
else
i
will
certainly
revisit
their
double
ipa
is
nice
too
keep
your
eyes
out
the
cascade
intensity
gives
this
one
a
nice
pine
and
citrus
flavor
and
a
light
body
a
nice
brew
for
an
introduction
to
the
ithaca
beer
co
deep
amber
good
clarity
topped
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
speckly
lace
good
head
retention
pungently
hoppy
aroma
lots
of
citrus
and
pine
just
pure
american
hops
mild
caramel
malt
background
pretty
clean
a
little
bit
of
floral
esters
allowing
the
hops
all
the
spotlight
if
you
like
big
hop
aroma
this
is
for
you
hops
punch
through
immediately
in
the
flavor
moderate
toasty
caramel
malt
smooth
on
the
palate
slathered
with
bright
green
hop
juice
big
citrus
and
pine
moving
into
a
boldly
bitter
agressive
finish
great
hop
flavor
a
little
floral
with
pungent
citrusy
notes
orange
and
grapefruit
a
high
level
of
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
too
much
for
my
tastes
something
a
little
milder
would
serve
to
increase
the
drinkability
still
pretty
nice
though
especially
after
sitting
a
while
lingering
hop
flavor
really
great
stuff
for
a
session
when
youre
jonesing
for
some
hops
great
balance
weighted
heavily
towards
the
hops
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
too
challenging
or
overpowering
not
super
complex
mostly
a
cascade
hop
showcase
but
i
dont
think
a
beer
has
to
be
really
crazy
to
be
good
this
ones
excellent
id
say
i
think
that
dogfish
head
ipas
60
and
90
havent
had
120
yethave
spoiled
me
personally
cant
imagine
any
ipa
is
going
to
top
them
last
swigs
this
is
what
it
claims
to
be
hoppy
red
thanks
to
fellow
ba
ithacabaron
for
giving
me
the
bottle
i
must
admit
that
i
was
excited
to
get
this
one
this
was
handed
to
me
with
a
light
to
medium
head
with
a
grassily
hoppy
nose
the
color
was
a
quintessentially
falllike
orangishlightbrown
and
it
was
also
very
cloudy
hence
imbibers
reluctance
to
pour
it
without
letting
it
settle
i
did
not
find
the
cloudiness
to
be
bad
so
no
worries
mate
it
was
a
very
hoppy
beer
especially
on
the
palate
the
finish
left
me
licking
my
lips
and
the
roof
of
my
mouth
both
for
more
of
the
flavor
and
to
clear
the
residue
yummy
ithaca
generally
is
very
mediocre
and
this
is
their
masterpiece
besides
small
runs
like
the
dipa
i
asked
the
woman
at
the
brewery
if
more
cascazilla
is
made
every
year
she
said
to
watch
the
stores
soon
good
news
for
me
i
feel
that
while
the
aging
changed
some
characteristics
of
the
beer
it
is
just
as
good
as
when
it
went
in
thanks
to
fellow
ba
charlesw
for
the
bottle
some
excitement
when
pouring
ie
there
was
a
bit
of
head
but
it
has
since
died
down
and
didnt
even
leave
me
with
any
lacing
i
enjoy
the
aroma
malty
some
grapefruitiness
around
the
edges
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thick
i
would
still
call
it
medium
though
theres
initial
maltiness
followed
by
some
low
grapefruit
citrusy
ness
i
enjoyed
this
one
am
glad
the
abv
wasnt
overwhelming
12
ouncer
sampled
no
freshness

it

according
to
the
label
i
just
finished
a
monstrously
hoppy
red
ale
ive
had
very
few
of
ithacas
beers
but
its
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
any
of
them
are
better
than
this
it
is
my
considered
opinion
that
the
amberred
ale
style
needs
a
swift
kick
in
the
ass
who
better
to
provide
it
than
the
citydestroying
hop
monster
cascazilla
ithaca
does
it
again
now
if
they
can
only
work
their
distribution
into
my
area
bender
another
solid
brew
from
ithaca
top
of
their
line
serious
competition
to
landmark
ira
glad
to
see
ithaca
going
out
on
a
limb
and
being
adventerous
poured
witha
a
clear
red
amber
witha
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
gradually
settled
to
a
skim
dry
hoppy
aroma
flowery
and
herbal
very
citrusy
witha
grapefruit
like
acidity
very
odd
rhubarb
like
sourness
kinda
tart
not
exactly
desireable
on
my
nose
nice
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
followed
by
a
immediate
dry
hoppy
taste
smooth
body
and
a
highly
drinkable
good
but
the
draft
is
so
much
better
overall
a
good
amber
ale
the
name
really
psyched
me
up
to
get
an
aromatic
ipa
though
and
so
i
was
a
bit
let
down
while
not
monstrously
hoppy
or
whatever
the
label
suggests
this
is
one
hopped
up
and
refreshing
beer
from
what
ive
read
this
one
is
brewed
with
cascade
hops
and
having
cut
my
teeth
on
these
western
flowers
this
beer
kinda
tastes
like
home
very
crisp
very
hoppy
yet
light
something
to
drink
on
a
hot
summers
day
if
theyre
still
making
this
fine
brew
by
then
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
mildly
malty
scent
with
a
boat
load
of
cascade
hops
which
were
grown
in
ny
it
is
quite
bitter
and
floral
the
taste
is
good
it
is
refreshingly
bitter
and
hoppy
all
the
way
through
the
malts
add
a
nice
buffer
and
balance
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
american
red
ale
i
love
the
hops
and
the
balance
this
is
a
great
offering
from
ithaca
a
good
drinker
nice
crystal
clear
ruby
red
body
moderate
light
tan
head
not
much
head
retention
lots
of
citrusy
and
flowery
hop
aroma
as
the
beer
warmed
i
could
smell
more
of
the
sweeter
malt
for
all
the
hop
aroma
the
beer
isnt
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
expected
its
much
less
hoppy
than
an
ipa
and
the
bitterness
doesnt
stay
around
long
in
the
mouth
its
actually
pretty
sweet
tasting
there
is
a
definite
hop
presence
just
not
as
much
as
i
expected
from
the
bottle
for
me
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
though
its
quite
a
drinkable
and
great
tasting
brew
there
is
also
a
nice
sweet
backbone
which
coaxes
a
sweet
orange
flavor
from
the
hops
and
lends
some
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
does
feel
like
a
double
ipa
drinkability
is
high
would
be
an
excellent
session
ipa
good
job
dan
and
crew
drinkability
is
very
solid
for
a
large
hopped
beer
malt
cuts
bitterings
just
enough
to
make
very
enjoyable

the
strong

drinkability
excellent
dont
see
that
many
sweet
yet
hoppy
brews
that
are
easily
drinkable
this
is
one
like
so
many
other
very
good
new
brews
ive
been
too
busy
enjoying
cascazilla
to
bother
reviewing
its
one
of
those
beers
generally
speaking
ive
been
doing
more
drinkin
and
less
geekin
but
here
goes
i
am
enjoying
this
crystal
clear
ruby
copper
colored
beauty
as
i
pen
this
nonsense
the
cascade
nose
cuts
through
the
senses
and
gives
a
clue
of
whats
to
come
this
is
a
boldly
hopped
brew
but
one
dimensional
it
is
not
quickly
shifting
gears
the
aroma
turns
caramel
sweet
the
first
taste
is
sharp
bitterness
smoothed
out
promptly
by
malty
graham
cracker
goodness
lingering
oily
bitterness
and
citrus
finish
it
off
the
hop
flavor
is
big
too
drinkability
is
outstanding
big
ups
to
ithaca
for
this
brew
i
have
always
enjoyed
ithaca
beers
though
they
dont
seem
to
get
much
recognition
or
respect
as
a
great
beer
casczilla
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
amber
that
makes
anyone
comfortable
with
it
in
their
hands
a
great
session
beer
its
a
little
unfortunate
that
this
sour
character
really
detracts
from
what
could
otherwise
be
a
fine
beer
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
medium
brownwhite
head
smell
is
immediately
attractive
deep
and
potent
composed
of
nutty
earthen
flavors
taste
is
excellent
first
of
all
the
hops
are
extremely
complimentary
they
draw
you
into
this
beer
yet
they
dont
have
the
sharp
bite
one
would
often
find
in
highlyhopped
beers
meanwhile
the
malt
is
meaty
and
strong
filling
yet
still
makes
for
a
refreshing
beer
a
flavor
hard
to
describe
but
easy
to
compliment
try
this
beer
when
given
the
opportunity

you
will
find
yourself
demanding
more
mouth
feel
is
a
little
overcarbonated
which
adds
sharpness
otherwise
though
its
interesting
to
delicious
beer
hell
of
a
kick
here
im
23
done
with
a
12
liter
share
of
the
growler
and
its
slapping
the
bejeezus
out
of
me
not
something
id
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
night
but
heythats
the
point
of
creative
brews
i
keep
wanting
to
take
another
swig
to
figure
out
the
everelusive
two
or
three
tastes
i
cant
name
but
they
dont
come
to
me
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
an
excellent
beer
for
a
beer
advocate
do
you
dig
the
distinction
bottles
should
be
out
mid
to
late
september
theyre
billing
it
as
a
hoppy
red
ale
made
with
100
cascade
hops
the
label
looks
pretty
cool
its
got
a
lizard
breathing
firey
red
hops
along
the
bottom
and
the
lettering
cant
remember
if
its
ithaca
beer
or
cascazilla
is
a
cut
out
of
a
waterfall
picture
backwash
maybe
im
way
off
the
mark
but
this
is
now
ibs
best
beer
aside
from
the
superlimited
double
ipa
ithaca
beer
has
chosen
to
explore
a
fairly
consistent
and
i

if

you

youll

some
pretty

beers
i
for
one
havent
had
too
many
american
micros
that
really
do
finesse
as
well
as
ithaca
does
and
these
latest
beers
have
improved
upon
the
slight
lack
of
flavor
concentration
apparent
in
some
earlier
beers
actually
the
whole
line
seems
to
have

this
is
a
really
good
tasting
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
troegs
feel
light
bodied
and
refreshing
cheers
on
tap
at
the
abe
airport
its
pretty
good
darker
amber
body
light
fruity
sweet
aroma
taste
was
similar
more
sweet
tastes
than
fruitiness
its
kind
of
like
a
baby
nugget
nectar
o
lacks
the
characteristic
caramel
note
often
found
in
ambers
but
thats
fine
with
me
i
also
really
like
the
higher
than
usual
bitterness
at
the
end
othis
is
a
fine
brew
definitely
worth
trying
if
to
havent
had
the
pleasure
but
this
isnt
your
normal
amber
typical
amber
ale
nothing
note
worthy
maybe
the
best
everyday
amber
i
have
ever
had
really
solid
not
too
bad
but
i
would
prefer
less
citrus
hops
beautiful
beer
in
the
glass
deep
rich
copper
color
small
head
great
carbonation
aromas
of
caramel
and
distinct
bitterness
spicy
clean
taste
malt
forward
seems
appropriate
with
nice
balance
through
the
bittering
hops
medium
mouth
bit
of
that
spicy
aftertaste
mmmm
about
2
weeks
old
not
super
hoppy
if
thats
your
thing
but
a
great
option
for
something
different
wellcrafted
amber
pours
a
great
gold
color
nose
is
robust
and
piny
the
hops
blend
together
very
well
balancing
it
out
surprisingly
well
not
very
good
bitter
and
less
hoppy
than
others
mild
smooth
a
good
session
beer
better
then
most
other
examples
of
the
style
decent
hops
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
ok
if
you
buy
it
or
me
on
tap
at
troegs
looks
pretty
clear
pure
color
nice
head
and
lacing
other
than
that
pretty
average
ok
not
great
not
horrible
just
ok
hoppy
yet
mild
almost
like
an
english
beer
interesting
take
on
amber

focusing
on

on
the
finish
very
well
balanced
flavor
profile
with
a
bit
of
complexity
and
quite
good
intensity
for
an
amber
ale
it
begins
with
a
blend
of
hop
flavor
that
transitions
to
mostly
pine
as
the
bitterness
begins
to
creep
in
beneath
all
of
this
is
a
good
caramel
backbone
that
takes
center
stage
as
the
mild
bitterness
releases
into
the
finish
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
over
a
mild
pine
oriented
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
pepper
like
spice
overall

its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
more
than
that
considering
that
its
available
just
about
everywhere
local
to
me
this
would
be
a
solid
go
to
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
cant
go
wrong
with
that
o
a
very
enjoyable
but
quite
hoppy
amber
ale
as
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
on
the
style
nice
complexity
of
flavors
and
aromas
that
is
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
troegs
is
available
in
your
area
pure
refreshment
here
this
brew
is
great
for
any
occasion
may
it
be
watching
sports
the
beach
after
cutting
the
grass
with
its
sweet
caramel
aroma
and
balanced
spicyherbal
hop
flavor
and
a
modest
amount
of
bitterness
this
can
be
an
everyday
beverage
another
great
beer
from
troegs
smell
is
kind
of
flowery
and
malty
the
flavor
balances
well
with
sweet
maltiness
and
hops
i
geta
little
lemon
and
some
pine
hop
flavor
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
this
is
a
relatively
lighter
beer
than
i
would
have
expected
finishes
nice
and
is
very
well
balanced
one
of
the
better
balances
i
have
had
o
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malts
floral
and
mild
tasty
o
this
is
a
very
well
done
amber
ale
it
hits
on
all
points
great
balance
nice
hop
flavor
and
aroma
great
malty
backbone
and
nice
finish
the
complexity
is
evident
as
the
flavors
slowly
mutate
throughout
the
sip
you
can
literally
feel
and
taste
the
beer
change
changing
character
as
you
swallow
pretty
neat
trick
a
very
good
amber
ale
which
starts
and
ends
with
hoppy
bitterness
with
a
hit
of
malt
in
the
middle
the
hoppiness
sets
it
apart
from
most
amberreds
and
raises
the
flavor
profile
the
beer
is
transparent
with
a
bronze
golden
body
and
a
half
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
brings
piney
hops
bready
malts
good
flavor
with
a
mild
sweetness
to
balance
the
robust
pine
component
medium
bodied
with
moderate
bitterness
a
solid
beer
from
a
fresh
keg
tasty
o
outstanding
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewer
would
revisit
this
beer
time
and
time
again
well
balanced
and
more
complex
than
i
would
have
guessed
o
meh
probably
wouldnt
have
again
this
could
qualify
as
an
darkish
ipa
based
on
the
flavor
profile
not
unlike
another
pa
hoppy
amber
victory
hopdevil
which
is
classified
as
an
ipa
some
may
liken
it
to
nugget
nectars
little
brother
but
its
a
far
cry
from
that
beer
still
this
is
a
really
good
hoppy
amber
especially
fresh
and
on
tap
o
troegs
delivers
another
solid
beer
with
hopback
amber
ale
while
its
not
outstanding
to
me
this
one
is
complex
and
offers
a
lot
to
be
enjoyed
while
sitting
pretty
with
a
very
sessionable
6
abv
i
wouldnt
buy
this
in
excess
for
the
sake
of
its
enjoyment
but
id
definitely
snag
a
6pack
for
game
day
with
friends
oi
love
this
beer
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
caramel
yummy
a
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
my
first
from
tröegs
and
i
hope
after
trying
this
one
not
my
last
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
way
the
hops
stayed
at
the
back
of
this
beer
until
the
finish
overall
this
amber
ale
is
for
the
hop
lover
and
is
quite
good
has
a
dry
finish
that
is
smooth
and
makes
you
want
another
sip
othis
is
a
great
amber
ale
on
to
the
best
part
of
all
beer
reviews
the
taste
this
brew
has
subtle
overtones
that
come
in
waves
of
flavor
it
was
very
pleasing
in
the
mouth
and
finish
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
enjoy
again
serving
type
16th
keg
at
first
sip
was
intrigued
to
feel
the
hit
of
hops
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
the
back
of
the
palate
not
disappointed
at
lack
of
sweetness
which
accompanies
many
amber
or
hoppy
blends
mostly
disappointed
that
with
additional
sipping
what
started
as
a
hint
of
charcoal
next
began
to
produce
more
of
a
chalky
texture
effect
this
was
the
most
pronounced
impression
it
made
on
me
and
unfortunately
if
a
beer
doesnt
finish
well
with
me
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
start
over
with
another
one
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
amber
ale
this
is
exactly
what
you
would
want
from
an
amber
ale
smooth
and
rich
with
just
enough
hops
the
hop
character
may
be
too
much
for
some
but
you
can
still
appreciate
it
in
the
flavor
the
color
is
very
appealing
and
the
aroma
is
pleasant
this
brew
is
great
on
draft
and
in
bottle
this
is
really
good
the
look
is
very
inviting
with
a
ton
of
sediment
the
smell
is
the
best
part
honey
and
hop
the
taste
is
a
reflection
of
the
smell
but
its
slightly
less
so
and
almost
watery
in
comparison
to
how
big
the
smell
is
i
would
probably
get
this
again
o
without
a
doubt
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
i
can
get
all
day
every
day
all
the
damn
time
at
nearly
every
liquor
store
with
a
halfassed
craft
beer
selection
that
is
i
frequent
what
else
could
be
expected
from
a
56ths
scale
nugget
nectar
i
really
should
buy
this
brew
more
often
overall
this
is
a
super
well
balanced
beer
very
mildley
hopped
and
balanced
perfect
with
sweet
malt
not
overly
bitter
not
overly
sweet
just
an
awesome
amber
bottle
from
trade
thanks
been
anting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
pours
a
deep
amber
bronze
with
a
nice
slightly
orange
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
malt
and
hints
of
grapefruit
hops
lightmedium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
flavor
is
mostly
fruity
malts
with
an
ever
so
slight
hop
zest
not
bad
but
also
not
super
exciting
excellent
bbq
beer
and
i
suspect
it
would
go
nicely
with
some
pulled
pork
o
great
amber
something
thats
full
of
flavor
that
you
could
go
to
all
year
round
taste
starts
with
sweet
and
floral
then
caramel
malt
then
tart
citrus
with
a
clean
crisp
piney
floral
caramel
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
a
bit
of
creaminess
and
high
carbonation
this
amber
ale
is
a
flavorful
crispeasy
to
drink
beer
overall
a
change
for
those
burnt
out
by
ipas
provides
the
hops
you
seek
while
softening
the
sharp
piney
edges
and
providing
a
tease
of
malt
hops
contribution
falls
somewhere
between
an
ipa
and
a
lighter
pale
ale
pretty
good
beer
od
expected
more
but
its
possibly
due
to
the
age
of
the
bottle
a
decent
beer
but
i
wanted
more
wouldnt
have
another
could
take
it
or
leave
it
overall
this
is
most
definitely
nugget
nectars
little
cousin
hot
damn
tröegs
this
is
great
best
amber
i
have
ever
had
for
sure
overall
ok
amber
ale
with
nugget
nectar
being
a
tough
act
to
follow
hop
back
amber
is
a
great
grab
by
troegs
while
nn
is
out
of
season
and
even
when
it
is
in
season
this
is
an
exceptionally
well
done
amber
with
a
distinct
flavor
well
worthy
of
a
purchase
o
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
hopback
is
a
great
alternative
from
heavyaggressive
imperial
or
double
ipas
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
those
while
not
a
session
ale
at
6
i
could
drink
it
all
day
my
favorite
from
the
pack
this
was
a
great
little
ale
to
enjoy
by
the
campfire
nice
mix
of
hops
here
havent
had
a
normalized
amber
ale
this
pleasant
and
balanced
in
a
while
if
this
is
the
base
for
nugget
nectar
then
i
intend
to
hoard
those
as
soon
as
theyre
in
season
the
malts
and
grains
are
really
well
held
together
and
still
allow
the
fruit
and
citrus
to
come
through
quite
well
refreshing
stuff
and
while
not
sessionable
i
could
most
definitely
have
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
not
complain
a
winner

is
a
dependable
brewery
and
this
is
a
consistently
good
beer
it
is
a
bright
amber
color
i
would
not
call
this
a
red
ale
at
all
it
is
an
amber
that
has
a
strong
hop
character
but
not
overwhelming
in
ibus
and
is
not
bitter
it
also
has
a
musky
hint
in
the
feel
and
flavor
that
i
like
very
much
it
smells
lovely
with
a
hint
of
blooming
flowers
and
has
a
unique
thing
about
it
that
makes
me
keep
coming
back
maybe
its
a
pinch
of
spice
or
something

this

have
had
this
on

a
few

much

for
me
the
pine
is
too
much
feel
wise
much
more
so
than
in

or
draft
forms
mouthfeel
was
phenomenal
silky
smooth
and
with
a
slight
hops
bite
on
the
tongue
good
carbonation
but
gave
it
more
points
just

be
warned
this

has
pretty
good
drinkability

doesnt
display

its
really
the
thick
semisweet

finishes
a

me
to

have
had
lots

of

produced
a
beer
that
i
can
drink
when
i
simply
want
something
of

definitely
a

i
would

overall
next
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finish
on
this
one
is
semidry
and
body
is
medium
pretty
average
carbonation
doesnt
overstep
its
boundaries
there
is
nothing
here
that
really
grabs
my
attention
i
often
feel
that
mouthfeel
is
the
hardest
to
give
a
score
to
since
it
is
either
on
or
off
i
mean
if
you
have
a
ris
that
is
super
carbonated
then
well
id
give
it
a
1
if
theres
a
light
macro
with
no
carbonation
then
id
give
it
a
1
for
me
its
extremes
the
beer
either
has
a
good
mouthfeel
or
it
doesnt
it
is
either
really
poor
where
it
should
be
or
it
is
something
totally
unexpected
that
just
blows
the
mind
this
one
is
where
it
should
be
easy
drinking
brew
one
that
i
could
easily
drink
all
night
given
im
in
a
hoppy
mood
as
the
weather
gets
colder
it
seems
im
more
into
a
porterstout
mood
still
this
is
one
that
id
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
not
bitter
like
an
ipa
really
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
in
that
aspect
but
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
all
about
hops
pretty
cool
beer
like
a
quasi
ipa
but
without
the
bitterness
i
feel
that
this
one
might
be
one
that
someone
who
doesnt
like
ipas
but
likes
nicely
balanced
beers
such
as
browns
esbs
etc
would
like
eric
cheers
it
is
not
my
favorite
from
troegs
nugget
nectar
is
but
is
very
pleasing
nonetheless
worth
a
try
and
dead
on
for
the
style
this
is
a
terrific
amber
form
troegs
i
could
drink
these
all
night
d
this
is
the
best
troegs
i
have
had
and
will
certainl
pick
up
a
case
when
in
pa
as
if
i
could
get
anything
less
a
nice
refreshing
new
style
that
i
originally
thought
was
going
to
a
different
take
on
a
pale
ale
again
the
hops
are
balances
to
perfection
yet
you
still
enjoy
a
robust
flavor
following
by
the
sweetness
to
your
tongue
poured
into
a
12
oz
glass
good
head
retention
that
fades
to
nice
lacing
down
to
the
last
swallow
nice
nutty
brown
color
with
visible
carbonation
not
much
malt
smell
but
a
citrusy
hops
aroma
is
apparent
but
theres
a
bready
malt
taste
thats
quickly
run
off
by
the
citrusy
hops
with
a
dry
yet
sweet
somewhat
fruity
finish
a
good
beer
all
around
ciao
thanks
to
crazymacharris
for
the
sample
this
is
a
beautiful
ale
that
is
crisp
and
malty
with
huge
hop
flavor
and
hints
of
caramel
that
arent
too
rich
the
bite
makes
it
refreshing
while
the
spice
and
texture
make
it
a
good
coldweather
beer
as
well
phenomenal
on
tap
but
holds
up
well
in
a
bottle
troegs
hopback
you
are
tried
and
true
d
yes
i
think
as
an
amber
ale
at
a
micro
id
get
this
again
in
the
bottle
082008
very
fresh
tasting
overall
impression
a
well
balanced
straight
forward
amber
a
little
less
carbonation
would
put
this
over
the
top
nicely
done
d
a
very
nice
smooth
drinking
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
i
dont
get
bored
with
this
beer
even
after
drinking
the
entire
2
liter
growler
a
good
flagship
beer
for
the
troegs
brewery
nice
work
chris
john
keep
it
up
this
is
a
solid
beer
all
around
i
think
i
read
somewhere
that
nugget
nectar
is
an
ampedup
version
of
hopback
and
i
can
believe
it
however
this
beer
certainly
has
its
own
distinct
identity
its
a
great
beer
for
really
any
occasion
if
you
like
a
tasty
amber
ale
with
a
nice
hoppy
kick
then
this
is
your
beer
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
with
1
fingered
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
of
nuts
and
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
wonderful
one
of
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
ever
tried
a
wonderful
balance
between
nut
flavor
citrusy
hops
and
malts
trully
an
amazing
balance
between
the
three
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
carbonation
level
seems
nice
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
great
session
beer
imo
superb
drinakability
a
nice
amber
to
session
on
ddrinkable
but
not
a
hoppy
beer
i
kind
of
think
that
its
false
advertising
they
should
change
the
name
to
indicate
this
is
more
of
a
red
ale
pours
a
nice
medium
brilliant
hue
amber
head
is
mediumsmall
with
minimal
lacing
smell
is
floral
sweet
and
of
course
hoppy
given
the
name
i
would
expect
a
much
stronger
hop
flavor
but
the
hops
dont
hit
until
the
finish
a
bit
of
spice
and
medium
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
about
what
i
expected
for
an
amber
ale
drinkability
is
still
high
as
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
overallwell
balanced
leaning
hoppy
an
excellent
example
of
a
contemporary
american
amber
i
think
the
real
craft
in
all
their
brews
is
this
creaminess
cudos
i
will
buy
it
again
pretty
nice
beer
i
like
hops
and
this
delivers
especially
for
a
amber
could
drink
this
all
night
probably
havent
caught
on
tap
or
even
in
bottles
though
pours
a
ruby
brown
in
color
that
is
translucent
about
quarter
inch
of
headfroth
forms
on
the
pour
smell
is
a
nice
balance
first
all
malt
then
deeper
some
hops
appear
theres
also
some
sort
of
spice
notes
as
well
taste
is
very
resinous
not
overly
bitter
but
hop
flavor
dont
know
how
to
exactly
describe
it
plenty
of
a
malt
backbone
to
support
it
this
is
different
than
anything
ive
had
of
the
style
decent
mouthfeel
but
a
tad
cloying
glad
to
see
troegs
in
ohio
overall
i
used
the
word
average
a
lot
because
i
cant
think
of
any
other
word
to
describe
the
born
on
date
is
81208
so
i
know
it
is
fresh
i
guess
this
just
isnt
the
beer
for
me

consumed
in
my
hotel
in
hampton
i
poured
a
12

bottle
into
a

glass
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
solid
12

as
the
head
settled
it
left
nice
rings
of
lacing
on
the
sides
the
boquet
was
hoppier
than
i
was
expecting
this
brew
has
a
pleseant
pine
and
citrus
aroma
the
hops
are
tasted
immediately
but
are
very
mellow
it
leaves
a
sweet
after
taste
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
it
goes
down
easily
troegs
has
another
very
solid
beer
here
d
very
drinkable
certainly
doesnt
taste
or
feel
like
a
6
percent
beer
this
was
part
of
my
troegs
sampler
case
which
did
not
have
a
bad
beer
in
it
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
was
light
brown
with
gold
hues
a
small
head
that
reduced
to
a
minimal
sheen
with
heavy
lacing
smelled
like
sweet
malts
and
hops
it
had
a
mild
hoppy
tastewith
a
sweet
malty
finish
this
is
a
very
pleasnt
drinkable
beer
i
look
forward
to
my
next
sampler
case
so
i
can
drink
3
more
of
these
the
feel
is
thick
and
chewy
creamy
and
viscous
really
good
its
a
bold
and
challenging
drink
smooth
dark
and
bitter
quite
nice
i
usually
go
for
this
beer
when
i
see
it
on
tap
it
is
nice
and
bitter
but
with
plenty
of
balance
to
make
it
interesting

the

with
some
serious
character
not
recommended
as
a
session
beer
but
strongly
suggested
with
food
or
just
to
admire
a
well
balanced
bold
example
of
this
style
you
are
something
special
within
a
style
that
never
becomes
overly
daring
the
hopback
defies
all
tame
stereotypes
and
leads
the
way
for
its

the

an
emphasis

long
after

contact
an
admirable

of
opposites
something
good
was

made

with

for

and
my
mouth
is
watering
slight
bubbles
rest

arent

which
allow
the
palate
to
enjoy
this

brew
great

color
with
a
taste
that
would
make

jemima
dirty

pants
slight
taste
of
spices
but
dont
take
away
from
the
hops
a
bitterdry
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
minute
and
then
dissapates
readying
you
for
the
next
sip
a
great

amber
ale
and
pale

of

my
second

to

within
seconds

field

scattered
specks
of

present
during
the
tasting
strong
scent
of

and
caramel
taste

with
a
pleasant
effervescence
across
the

hops
bitterness
at
the
finish
is
substantially
cut
by
the
caramel
flavoring
the
balance
this
brew
struck
between
sweet
and
bitter
made
this
quite
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
pretty
good
one
of
the
hoppier
amber
ales
ive
had
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
small
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
shows
decent
retention
and
leaves
only
a
hint
of
lacing
smell
is
big
on
floral
hops
with
a
big
pine
presence
on
top
of
a
sweet
caramel
malt
base
the
taste
is
a
slightly
more
balanced
version
of
the
smell
with
a
more
subdued
floral
and
pine
hop
kick
up
front
that
is
balanced
really
well
by
the
sweet
caramel
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
creamy
with
good
carbonation
and
only
the
slightest
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
amber
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
give
it
a
good
kick
very
nice
lively
mouthfeel
carbonation
came
through
even
though
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
head
overall
i
enjoyed
the
draft
version
much
better
bottled
version
does
not
showcase
the
hop
flavors
as
well
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
well
balanced
well
crafted
awesome
i
really
really
like
this
one
drink
em
if
ya
got
em
had
this
as
a
hand
pump
at
zenos
in
state
college
i
have
had
many
of
these
beers
out
of
the
bottle
at
home
but
the
bartender
said
the
nitro
was
10x
better
and
i
have
to
admit
he
was
totally
right
wow
this
is
something
else
looked
great
but
the
smell
is
amazing
triple
the
hop
smell
than
from
the
bottle
as
goes
the
taste
as
well
there
is
so
much
more
hop
nose
and
flavor
it
is
amazing
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
in
hand
pump
do
it
overall
this
is
another
quality
brew
by
troegs
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
a
crowd
i
think
the
pale
ale
has
more
hops
body
to
it
but
this
is
a
very
balanced
leaning
on
the
maltier
side
brew
one
reviewer
labled
this
nugget
nectars
little
brother
but
for
me
thats
far
from
the
truth
the
nn
is
a
entire
different
animal
but
one
that
i
love
this
beer
has
good
color
as
well
as
a
very
well
balance
of
malt
and
hops
very
drinkable
beer
the
hops
stand
out
but
are
not
in
your
face
finish
is
smooth
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
lasts
into
the
afetrtaste
a
nice
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
the
lovely
day
with
drinkability
good
beer
with
nice
balance
hops
and
malt
combine
very
well
this
is
a
good
beer
that
you

ballanced
flavor
medium
bodied
feel
good
on
the
palet
and
it
pretty
drinkable
would
be
a
good
session
beer
side
note
thinking
this
could
be
the
perfect
gateway
beer
my
value
beer
buddy

recently
declared
this
his
new
absolute
favorite
beer
worth
paying
real
money
for
d
not
your
typical
hop
heavy
brew
this
is
much
more
complex
and
balanced
highly
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
somewhat
smooth
feel
moderatemedium
body
for
amber
but
still
feels
a
little

is
a
smooth
and
spicy

nicely
with
toasted
grains
drinkability
fantastic
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
delightful
beer
to
drink
in
the
spring
on
the
back
deck
d
very
drinkable
beer
its
hoppy
and
enjoyable
without
the
inyourface
bitterness
one
would
expect
from
a
beer
with
such
hop
content
some
ambers
can
be
a
bit
too
sweet
or
cloying
but
hopback
amber
provides
a
wonderful
drinking
experience
tasty
and
pretty
big
for
amber
but
its
no
where
near
as
good
as
its
bigger
brother
nugget
nectar
also
that
off
offputting
quality
in
the
finish
has
me
detracting
points
and
is
keeping
me
from
really
enjoying
this
and
wanting
another
drinkability
suffers
some
for
that
d
very
drinkable
and
a
very
safe
beer
to
drink
if
youre
into
hops
this
is
a
very
nice
but
not
completely
overwhelming
beer
highly
recommended
d
a
very
easy
drinking
tasty
amber
i
could
easily
go
through
a
6
pack
i
think
i
actually
prefer
this
to
nugget
nectar
d
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
2
of
these
while
i
was
in
va
hopback
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
dark
copper
with
an
ample
beige
head
smell
is
not
very
pronounced
just
floral
hops
with
a
faint
hint
of
malt
it
tastes
of
hops
and
malts
and
is
kind
of
woody
its
rather
bitter
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
thickness
is
perfect
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
heavy
and
full
of
hops
this
is
my
first
sample
of
anything
from
troegs
but
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
and
the
way
it
finishes
overall
a
go
to
beer
aalways
some
in
the
fridge
and
it
is
a
beer
you
can
always
trust
to
be
great
get
it
thanks
to
pete
for
bringin
this
back
from
pa
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
beautiful
rubymahogany
color
with
a
tan
fluffy
head
wonderful
hop
aromas
piney
flowery
great
biting
flavor
for
an
amber
no
bland
malt
bomb
here
wonderful
balance
with
the
right
amount
of
caramel
and
toffe
flavored
malts
backing
up
the
hop
kick
very
drinkable
i
have
found
another
favorite
from
troegs
notes
it
seemed
something
was
missingperhaps
a
bit
more
hop
or
some
more
malts
i
suppose
that
one
could
easily
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
isbut
did
i
hear
someone
say
pass
me
a
roxy
just
kidding
i
liked
it
and
i
will
buy
it
again
if
youre
a
raging
hophead
like
me
youll
love
this
brew
if
not
i
feel
like
you
still
might
be
able
to
enjoy
it
or
maybe
im
just
used
to
hops
i
dont
know
maybe
have
a
few
more
moderately
hopped
beers
before
this
one
but
even
then
hopback
can
bridge
the
gap
to
even
hoppier
beers
than
itself
d
easy
to
put
a
sixer
of
this
down
during
a
steeler
game
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
during
a
football
game
maybe
troegs
should
initiate
a
new
beer
style
rpa
for
red
pale
ale
i
could
drink
several
of
these
im
glad
i
can
get
them
fairly
locally
another
fine
offering
from
the
troegs
brewery
overall
one
of
the
best
amber
ales
ive
tasted
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
still
an
outstanding
example
of
the
malty
pale
and
amber
ales
beloved
by
pennsylvania
brewers
this
is
a
beer
i
will
go
back
to
as
often
as
i
can
delightfully
balanced
between
the
floral
and
herbal
hops
and
the
roasted
malts
slight
bitter
finish
but
nothing
unbearable
overall
a
goldstar
effort
from
troegs
and
a
highly
drinkable
amber
beer
d
bring
it
on
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
while
and
certainly
a
worthy
yearround
beer
for
troegs
portfolio
i
can
drink
this
any
time
perfect
balance
of
malts
and
hops
in
this
one
d
excellent
drinkability
i
like
it
not
as
cold
though
mfd
this
slightly
oily
medium
bodied
ale
coats
the
mouth
well
highly
recommended
a
great
beer
despite
having
a
huge
blast
of
hops
this
beer
mellows
out
wonderfully
totally
stoked
that
i
can
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
just
down
the
block
drinkability
excellent
drinkability
toned
down
almost
sessionliker
version
of
nugget
nectar
this
is
a
realy
good
beer
id
have
to
say
its
my
favorite
american
amber
ale
the
hops
are
lively
but
not
overpowering
giving
a
little
spice
with
it
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
recommended
mfd
really
good
medium
bodied
beer
that
drinks
very
smooth
slight
oily
mouthfeel
that
is
typical
of
the
hoppy
beers
my
second
selection
from
troegs
first
one
was
nugget
nectar
and
i
am
very
impressed
look
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
sampler
that
i
bought
im
sure
many
would
disagree
but
its
like
the
malts
are
the
feature
here
their
candylike
somewhat
gooey
syrup
sweetness
making
this
far
more
drinkable
than
it
wouldve
been
if
the
hops
had
their
way
entirely
but
hopheads
could
never
dislike
this
a
supremely
balanced
beer
and
pretty
freaking
delicious
too
yet
another
tradeshow
sample
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
dark
color
and
creamy
head
that
it
produced
it
was
a
tad
heavy
meaning
that
it
was
to
be
savoured
like
a
good
wine
obviously
the
hops
were
very
pronounced
which
wins
a
spot
high
on
my
listi
greatly
enjoy
the
bite
of
the
hops
it
was
smooth
and
had
a
tiny
bit
of
an
aftertaste
but
by
no
means
was
it
too
much
to
enjoy
i
did
like
this
beer
but
would
like
it
much
better
if
i
had
tiem
to
savor
it
better
d
i
could
have
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
one
really
surprised
me
i
loved
it
notes
my
first
offering
from
troegs
i
grabbed
this
at
a
bev
ctr
on
the
side
of
route
17
in
nj
was
hoping
theyd
have
nugget
nectar
but
this
was
a
worthy
substitute
at
around
8
a
sixer
d
a
great
drinking
hopped
amber
that
is
case
worthy
by
all
means
one
that
is
very
enjoyable
in
multiples
and
hard
to
tire
of
surprisingly
this
pours
darker
than
its
big
brother
nugget
nectar
and
darker
than
most
amberreds
mahogany
in
color
with
nice
clarity
and
a
dissipating
offwhite
head
and
lacing
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
although
caramel
dark
fruit
and
roasted
nuts
are
present
lacks
any
citric
hop
character
decent
dark
maltiness
in
the
taste
with
a
smooth
hop
bitterness
underneath
good
but
not
great
mediumbodied
with
a
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
sessionable
at
this
abv
d
i
have
been
extremely
impressed
with
troegs
beers
this
is
no
exception
a
very
sessionable
american
amber
troegs
does
an
excellent
job
of
balancing
their
beers
the
6
0
abv
on
top
of
everything
else
makes
this
a
very
sessionable
beer
very
good
beer
great
hops
taste
along
the
lines
of
an
like
hop
devil
or
hoptical
illusion
appearance
was
almost
perfect
copper
color
smell
was
almost
perfect
as
well
taste
was
a
45
a
bit
more
bite
than
even
a
high
hop
should
have
but
could
have
been
the
6
pack
i
bought
nothing
wrong
with
a
4
out
of
5
at
all
just
pointing
out
why
it
wasnt
a
55
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
i
bet
it
is
even
better
d
taste
just
isnt
there
to
carry
this
beer
for
me
i
have
always
been
interested
in
troegs
beers
and
that
interest
exponentially
grew
after
i
visited
the
brewery
i
have
always
liked
troegs
hopback
amber
bc
of
the
hopiness
and
well
balanced
flavors
then
i
went
and
got
a
sample
straight
from
the
brewery
and
what
a
difference
the
flavors
are
much
more
distinct
and
come
through
much
brighter
it
has
55
ibus
according
to
troegs
but
it
is
masked
very
well
with
their
signature
amber
ale
style
wonderful
color
creamwhite
head
and
super
easy
to
drink
a
lot
rich
amber
pour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
and
a
balanced
nose
of
hops
and
malt
found
it
a
bit
watery
and
slightly
thin
but
with
a
decent
balanced
flavor
and
what
seemed
to
be
some
alcohol
peeking
through
nice
and
drinkable
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
da
stellar
brew
and
one
i
will
be
picking
up
at
the
corner
store
more
often
this
is
a
well
rounded
brew
with
complexity
but
one
that
does
not
overwhelm
the
senses
deep
amber
with
a
brown
hue
topped
by
a
quickly
fading
light
tan
head
nose
has
some
caramelized
british
malts
and
some
fruity
aromatic
qualities
of
mild
american
hops
and
a
nutty
hint
as
well
slightly
over
carbonated
the
flavor
has
a
light
fruity
hop
touch
upfront
with
dried
orange
peel
followed
by
a
nutty
character
the
finish
has
a
dark
toastiness
and
a
prolonged
bitterness
pretty
good
american
amber
d
good
drinkability
one
could
sit
and
have
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
drinkability
not
exactly
everything
i
had
hoped
for
more
amber
than
hoppy
a
decent
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
mine
trying
again
a
little
further
down
the
road
a
nice
ruby
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
left
a
sticky
trail
all
the
way
done
the
glass
the
aroma
is
heavily
floral
and
pinelike
hops
the
strong
floral
hops
coat
the
mouth
and
dominate
the
flavor
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
sweet
malt
to
provide
some
balance
drinkable
on
whole
but
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
malt
balance
m
d
medium
body
a
little
slick
with
a
nice
lingering
effect
tasty
a
reasonably
low
abv
means
ill
have
a
few
of
these
this
evening
the
troegs
seem
to
have
a
gift
for
good
brews
the
more
i
have
from
the
brewery
the
more
fond
of
it
i
become
d
another
winner
from
troegs
this
beer
is
a
great
amber
with
a
kick
of
hops
that
is
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
good
balanced
amber
ale
nothing
overwhelming
but
definitely
possessing
a
pleasing
taste
and
worthy
of
a
second
sampling
single
12
oz
bottle
purchased
from
garys
in
madison
from
what
i
understand
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
younger
brother
of
troegs
nugget
nectar
which
i
recently
sampled
and
was
excellent
this
bottle
however
didnt
quite
live
up
to
its
hype
a
very
impressive
dark
rubyred
almost
purple
appearance
led
to
an
immense
frothy
and
foamy
head
that
soon
receded
smell
carried
slight
amber
notes
with
hops
grains
and
slight
malts
and
the
taste
strongly
mirrored
a
classic
amber
style
with
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
along
with
apparent
grapefruit
and
citrus
essences
pretty
good
rich
mouthfeel
with
an
equally
good
level
of
drinkability
made
a
nice
sample
but
nothing
above
and
beyond
troegs
has
a
good
reputation
for
their
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
good
beer
not
very
noticeable
are
the
malts
i
get
some
caramel
sweetness
but
overall
the
hops
take
control
now
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
however
i
was
looking
for
some
more
malt
to
balance
this
one
a
bit
more
it
is
very
refreshing
and
happened
to
pair
well
with
a
beef
mushroom
and
barley
soup
not
a
big
fan
of
hoppy
ambers
this
had
a
lot
bold
flavors
nice
beer
but
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
excellent
drinkability
dthis
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
welcome
to
ny
troegs
good
beer
nice
experiment
in
styles
id
definitely
drink
this
again
the
beer
pours
out
a
deep
amber
color
with
an
alright
head
nothing
crazy
the
first
thing
that
hits
your
nose
is
a
mild
piney
citrus
hops
scent
the
taste
is
very
smooth
the
malt
hops
caramel
all
blend
together
perfectly
the
drinkability
for
me
is
very
high
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
out
there
right
now
tpretty
good
beer
it
is
very
well
balanced
there
is
definitely
a
malt
profile
i
know
it
is
called
hopback
but
hops
are
not
prominent
its
a
good
beer
that
meets
the
requirement
for
the
style
its
not
a
beer
that
will
knock
you
off
your
feet
however
i
have
bought
and
consumed
many
of
them
its
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
with
a
good
deal
of
bubbles
slowly
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
head
is
offwhite
and
looks
about
like
the
consistency
of
frothed
milk
leaves
some
thick
raised
rings
of
lace
with
each
sip
aroma
is
very
toasty
with
a
really
sweet
malt
backing
theres
a
good
deal
of
fruity
esters
and
citruspine
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
has
a
solid
caramel
malt
base
with
loads
of
toasted
malt
character
crystal
malt
the
hops
bring
herbal
and
citric
notes
to
the
fore
in
the
middle
of
each
sip
there
isnt
much
bitterness
here
rather
just
a
good
solid
hop
profile
finishes
a
touch
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
diacetyl
mouthfeel
is
really
silky
solid
and
smooth
in
the
carbonation
nice
drinker
overall
and
surely
one
of
the
better
ambers
ive
ever
come
across
d
almost
too
good
this
beer
vanished
so
quickly
it
made
me
paranoid
someone
mustve
been
sneaking
sips
when
i
wasnt
looking
great
beer
that
redeemed
this
brewery
for
me
prior
to
this
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
troegs
i
take
it
all
back
big
reco
here
clear
coppery
colour
with
a
thin
sticky
beige
cap
good
head
retention
lots
of
lacing
hoppy
aroma
citrusy
and
spicy
for
the
most
part
but
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
grassiness
too
solid
malt
backbone
on
this
one
balancing
the
mellow
bitterness
and
hop
presence
spicy
hops
dominate
with
notes
of
citrus
floral
and
grassy
hops
throughout
ends
with
a
spicy
orange
flavour
that
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
medium
bodied
just
short
of
average
carbonation
really
nice
texture
just
a
bit
of
creaminess
and
warmth
ive
really
been
impressed
with
troegs
lately
and
have
enjoyed
their
beers
quite
a
lot
theres
a
lot
of
flavour
here
but
balanced
isnt
sacrificed
great
stuff
d
pretty
good
i
am
not
a
hop
head
but
i
think
a
hop
bomb
in
this
thing
would
make
for
a
well
rounded
hop
experience
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
but
would
def
drink
it
again
i
was
able
to
get
this
tröegs
beer
at
high
street
grill
on
1202008
they
served
it
to
me
in
a
tröegs
pint
glass
it
poured
a
dark
amber
that
looked
like
it
blended
in
with
some
cranberry
red
it
had
a
1
inch
head
of
white
foam
that
quickly
receded
into
a
handful
of
white
foamy
rings
and
a
few
streaks
of
white
lace
it
had
a
mild
fruit
based
aroma
that
contained
caramel
malts
a
dash
of
pepper
and
few
bitter
hops
the
taste
was
refreshing
with
the
taste
of
juicy
fruits
toasted
malts
splash
of
pine
hint
of
caramel
and
dry
roasted
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
good
aftertaste
of
fruits
and
piny
hops
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
in
bottles
before
the
draft
version
is
much
better
than
the
bottled
version
if
you
ever
see
this
on
tap
at
your
local
bar
you
should
try
a
glass
of
this
beer
for
youeself
it
wont
let
you
down
moreys
bottom
line
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
start
off
your
friends
that
arent
quite
ready
for
ipasdipas
would
go
good
with
mexican
or
spicy
mediterranean
fair
d
a
very
nice
beer
a
managable
abv6
and
very
good
for
a
session
beer
rereviewed
one
month
later
i
added
another
half
point
to
the
aroma
pure
delight
and
it
should
definitely
be
listed
as
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
this
beer
is
less
medium
bodied
than
i
originally
reviewed
overall
the
beer
is
great
drinkability
high
drinknability
the
theme
of
these
troegs
beers
thus
far
is
balance
this
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
and
drinknable
rich
ale
try
their
sample
pack
this
is
a
great
brew
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
finish
this
is
definitely
one
that
i
will
have
again
pours
nearly
crystal
clear
amberreddish
in
color
lower
carbonation
and
thin
white
head
smells
very
fresh
and
inviting
juicy
citrus
hops
and
a
biscuity
malt
backbone
taste
follows
suit
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
orange
tangerine
light
grapefruit
hops
and
a
nice
caramel
and
sweet
malt
backbone
toasted
bread
like
malt
too
good
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
pretty
darn
drinkable
but
not
a
favorite
the
nugget
nectar
is
amazing
when
i
compare
the
two
but
it
is
what
it
is
this
is
a
great
cask
beer
i
have
had
the
bottled
version
before
and
was
not
as
impressed
by
its
flavor
then
it
was
good
but
on
the
hand
pump
this
blew
me
away
if
you
find
it
cask
dont
pass
it
up
this
up
d
very
drinkable
could
of
had
a
few
of
these
but
i
had
already
had
a
few
and
had
to
drive
it
seemed
like
a
sessionable
hoppy
ale
a
tiny
bit
of
carbonated
sharpness
accompanies
the
minute
sweetness
that
leads
in
the
taste
a
healthy
biscuit
malt
backbone
is
rounded
out
by
those
fresh
earthy
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
a
fresh
and
medium
bodied
creaminess
completes
this
enjoyable
and
elegant
brew
a
very
wellbalanced
and
tasty
amber
from
troegs
too
many
american
ambersred
ales
seem
to
cross
that
apaipa
line
with
extreme
hopping
this
beer
however
stays
true
to
its
ale
roots
the
hops
are
there
for
sure
but
the
taste
and
drinking
experience
still
says
ale
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
nice
clear
red
hued
brown
minimal
head
nose
is
like
vibrant
cherries
but
not
extremely
pungent
really
flavor
is
nice
and
woody
in
a
milder
way
hops
are
present
in
a
leafy
and
slightly
almost
smoked
way
medium
level
sweet
edge
to
it
very
smooth
and
consistent
flavor
feel
has
a
fairly
full
level
of
carbonation
sending
tiny
bubbles
over
my
tongue
liquid
has
a
good
body
overall
very
drinkable
extremely
smooth
and
even
though
the
sweet
kick
on
the
tail
end
seems
slightly
out
of
place
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
hoppy
and
begs
you
to
drink
it
flavor
is
of
caramel
that
is
balanced
by
the
hoppiness
this
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
high
this
improved
drastically
as
it
warmed
this
is
a
nice
beer
will
have
again
d
tasty
sessionable
as
simple
as
that
d
darn
good
also
sessionable
with
plenty
of
malt
and
hop
flavor
theres
something
to
enjoy
for
people
on
both
sides
of
the
spectrum
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
color
with
a
rather
small
head
that
left
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
piney
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
nice
light
piney
hop
flavor
that
is
quickly
balanced
by
a
sweet
malt
presence
almost
root
beer
like
no
real
strong
flavors
but
a
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
the
feel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
well
balanced
a
real
good
sessionable
brew

extremely
easy
drinking
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
the
style
d
this
was
a
good
beer
it
has
a
powerful
hop
bite
for
a
red
ale
but
i
was
impressed
by
the
hops
and
amber
flavor
combonation
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
overall
troegs
make
great
beer
and
this
one
is
just
that
perfectly
balanced
beer
that
has
an
even
level
of
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
just
so
mild
yet
perfect
really
nice
beer
would
love
to
sit
down
with
a
12
pack
turn
on
the
nfl
sunday
ticket
and
drink
until
the
games
were
over
or
until
i
was

whichever
happened
to
come
first
drinkability

check

check
this
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
when
wanting
to
swill
some
terrific
beer
while
watching
football
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
cant
wait
to
finish
the
last
one
big
thanks
to
leftmindedrighty
smells
dominated
by
pine
and
citrus
with
a
floral
hint
taste
is
a
nice
combo
of
sweet
malts
to
balance
out
the
piney
hops
the
seperation
here
from
being
an
ipa
is
the
toned
down
finish
its
more
creamy
and
mellow
without
the
bitter
finish
easy
drinking
and
very
inviting
d
very
good
beer
that
shines
when
on
cask
as
most
beers
do
imho
could
drink
this
multiple
times
without
hesitation
a
solid
offering
from
troegs
very
good
taste
very
good
drinkability
in
my
book
another
goodie
from
troegsi
really
could
not
wait
this
one
poured
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
the
tiniest
hint
of
an
orange
hue
deep
carbonation
came
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
only
to
reinforce
the
large
head
of
white
stick
and
foamy
lace
that
formed
on
the
top
great
retention
finally
gave
way
to
copious
side
glass
lace
and
a
nice
little
film
across
the
top
the
smell
was
deeply
hopped
very
nice
bouquet
of
floral
hops
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
notes
accentuating
a
typical
amber
back
nicely
malted
with
large
hints
of
grains
the
flavor
was
so
much
hoppier
then
i
had
thought
it
would
be
there
was
a
huge
citrus
hop
punch
from
the
very
first
sip
and
a
very
nice
resin
like
taste
that
followed
you
throughout
the
session
leaving
behind
a
great
dry
and
bitter
finish
great
use
of
the
hops
here
as
the
typical
amber
will
have
more
of
the
malty
character
which
was
still
evident
in
the
underlying
base
here
however
the
big
hop
presence
not
only
balanced
it
well
but
pushed
it
over
to
the
lighter
side
and
gave
it
much
more
of
a
bright
feel
great
smooth
and
light
body
with
ample
carbonation
led
this
to
be
an
easy
session
beer
overall
i
had
honestly
never
heard
of
this
one
before
i
got
it
and
it
was
truly
wonderful
this
was
a
great
beer
and
something
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
a
nice
well
rounded
amber
that
could
hold
its
own
with
a
lot
of
sessionable
ipas
definitely
have
to
recommend
this
one
a
little
hazy
and
on
the
darker
side
of
light
amber
with
an
off
whitte
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quick
but
leaves
nice
lace
nose
is
hoppier
than
expected
and
i
did
expect
hop
but
the
nice
herbal
pine
citrus
smell
is
balanced
out
by
a
sweet
malt
scent
in
the
background
its
also
a
little
spicy
maybe
some
ginger
and
white
pepper
taste
is
really
nice
with
a
pretty
light
medium
body
that
is
very
soft
it
really
delivers
a
much
more
balanced
taste
tha
nthe
nose
would
suggest
very
clean
great
for
an
all
daysession
drink
d
good
and
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
if
this
had
a
little
more
in
the
mouthfeel
department
this
would
be
a
real
winner
worth
a
try
without
a
doubt
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
love
hops
so
i
am
in
heaven
complex
but
well
balanced
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
hops
and
sweet
roasted
malts
both
shine
easy
to
drink
complex
and
flavorful
enough
to
keep
your
attention
but
not
overpowering
enough
to
burn
you
our
very
good
with
food
this
may
be
my
new
go
to
everydaysession
beer
recommended
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
the
aroma
was
muted
somewhat
but
i
expected
that
since
it
seems
to
be
what
i
encounter
with
cask
ales
there
was
some
hops
pine
and
lemon
zest
and
some
sweet
malts
touch
of
fruitiness
the
flavor
seemed
like
a
blended
version
of
the
bottles
i
have
had
previously
it
was
good
but
nothing
really
stood
out
towards
the
bottom
third
of
the
glass
i
did
notice
more
of
the
hops
in
the
taste
and
the
sweetness
faded
some
creamy
caskconditioned
feel
to
it
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
bottles
this
was
an
awesome
brew
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
delicious
i
sure
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
i
will
drink
this
again
and
hopefully
soon
this
was
an
awesome
brew

sure
wish
i
had

with
some
good

and
some

aroma
of
floral
and
bitter
hops
is
dominating
taste
is
a
mix
between
light
caramel
malt
with
some
bitter
hops
at
the
end
body
is
about
average
with
some
great
carbonation
with
the
level
of
hops
that
can
be
found
in
this
beer
it
is
almost
leaning
toward
an
ipa
very
good
session
beer
overall
it
poured
a
pretty
rich
amber
color
with
decent
head
formation
aroma
was
light
citrusy
hops
flavor
was
definitely
hoppy
i
could
find
a
bit
of
fault
in
the
beer
it
was
just
a
touch
stale
and
cardboardy
up
front
and
just
a
touch
sour
at
the
finish
which
might
not
have
been
the
case
if
id
had
a
bit
fresher
bottle
mine
was
dated
5507
meaning
it
was
just
over
4
months
old
when
i
drank
it
still
there
was
a
lot
to
like
in
this
beer
including
being
very
drinkable
definitely
recommended
body
is
medium
creamy
and
uber
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
that
will
certainly
keep
you
interested
hopback
amber
makes
me
think
of
what
unlagered
brooklyn
lager
might
taste
like
complex
but
well
balanced
flavorful
but
not
so
overpowering
in
any
particular
aspect
hops
and
sweet
roasted
malts
are
all
solid
in
this
medium
bodied
brew
makes
me
hope
that
i
get
my
hands
on
some
nugget
nectar
sometime
soon
drinkability
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
pours
a
ruby
red
burnt
orange
color
with
a
bubbly
white
foam
almost
tan
head
lingers
around
for
a
little
while
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
and
floral
earthy
hop
presence
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
malt
and
bittering
hops
mouth
feel
is
strong
and
heavy
carbonated
creating
a
really
nice
balance
of
all
the
flavors
a
solid
amber
ale
one
of
my
under
rated
favorite
styles
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
smells
crisp
with
floral
hops
a
nice
boquet
indeed
tastes
of
refeshing
malt
fresh
hops
this
is
verrry
smooth
and
a
delight
has
qualities
from
my
favorite
troegs
nugget
nectar
for
an
amber
red
this
is
a
gem
great
drinkability
d
i
immediately
opened
another
one
nuff
said
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
was
immediately
strong
of
hops
and
was
persistent
the
taste
was
strong
initially
of
hops
with
some
malt
present
and
finishing
bitter
the
hops
are
noticeable
and
pleasant
adding
to
the
overall
enjoyment
it
has
a
very
clean
and
balanced
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
crisp
and
suits
the
beer
nicely
overall
this
is
a
delightful
brew
drinkability
no
surprise
that
troegs
pounds
out
another
winner
these
guys
are
in
the
elite
this
is
definetly
not
in
nugget
nectars
class
but
a
nice
easier
drinking
alternative
when
you
want
an
ipa
without
all
the
gravity
overall
an
excellent
and
unique
amber
ale
highly
recommended
d
its
a
good
beer
and
would
be
a
good
standby
or
introduction
to
craft
beer
with
your
bmc
buddies
big
malty
mouthfeel
that
has
a
oily
residue
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
overall
hopback
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
one
thats
quite
drinkable
but
it
stumbles
in
the
taste
department
i
want
to
try
this
beer
again
perhaps
the
12
hour
car
ride
didnt
help
things
this
brew
pours
pretty
much
like
many
amber
ales
i
have
had
in
the
past
amber
color
not
too
much
heading
but
still
good
looking
smell
had
toasted
grains
and
lots
of
hops
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
an
ipa
in
the
way
that
it
has
a
big
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
brew
for
sure
it
is
too
bad
that
troegs
does
not
distribute
to
ma
oh
well
ill
enjoy
the
six
pack
while
it
lasts
cheers
the
aroma
is
where
the
hops
really
shine
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
balanced
tealike
hops
with
a
suggestion
of
mint
mild
bitterness
i
dig
that
its
not
a
glassfull
of
citrus
hops
a
little
noble
character
pours
a
clean
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
of
hops
and
a
bit
earthy
tastes
of
hops
but
a
watery
taste
a
small
dry
bitter
end
a
decent
hop
a
light
body
but
expecting
a
bit
more
in
body
but
it
is
still
very
nice
i
do
respect
this
because
it
is
the
nugget
nectars
daddy
d
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
if
only
there
wasnt
much
else
to
choose
from
i
have
to
give
it
credit
for
some
reason
this
beer
seems
like
a
good
starter
for
someone
trying
to
get
into
craft
brew
it
kind
of
covers
that
area
between
a
simple
macro
and
a
more
interesting
microbrew
very
nice
orange
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
on
top
good
mellow
and
hoppy
aroma
nice
full
hop
flavorslight
citrusy
taste
and
floral
at
the
same
time
soft
maltiness
to
it
good
body
very
full
though
not
overly
so
very
drinkable
beerwould
make
a
great
session
beer
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
nugget
nectar
junior
well
balanced
all
around
i
only
got
one
bottle
of
this
what
a
tease
pours
a
very
clear
shiny
amber
with
bright
edges
and
a
molasses
center
little
head
beautiful
hop
aroma
that
displays
a
few
hop
varieties
some
4c
aromas
and
some
spicyearthy
englishstyle
ones
the
aroma
is
evocative
powerful
and
restrained
enough
not
to
overwhelm
its
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
the
palate
breaks
down
a
bit
with
a
thin
lemon
grass
tea
note
cropping
up
where
the
flavors
should
be
more
well
rounded
but
thats
a
quibble
really
theres
sharp
substantially
carbonated
bitterness
first
off
then
some
sweeter
nutty
malts
and
a
tealike
finish
overall
this
is
very
good
amber
ale
and
the
best
troegs
beer
ive
tried
good
medium
body
absolutely
stunning
for
a
day
like
today
around
70
sunny
breezy
easily
drinkable
but
then
so
is
miller
for
the
same
reasons
the
absent
finish
as
you
can
tell
really
bothered
me
as
i
ws
expecting
much
more
out
of
this
usually
adventurous
brewery
d
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
amber
ales
i
had
this
one
because
it
was
in
thetroegs
multipack
i
bought
this
is
very
drinkable
and
my
favorite
amber
ale
yet
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
another
great
brew
by
troegs
that
i
will
have
again
proud
to
claim
these
brewers
as
pennsylvanians
the
smell
of
hops
is
thrust
throughout
the
family
room
as
the
rich
amber
body
settles
into
a
shaker
a
fruity
salty
effervescence
smooths
out
the
mellow
hop
taste
although
slight
acidity
is
present
at
the
tongues
back
a
label
that
is
backed
by
its
substance
hopback
crafts
a
delicious
noncomplex
ale
that
works
as
an
allseason
pintnot
an
easy
accomplishment

is
justifiably
proud
in
calling
this
their
signature
beer
wellcrafted
interesting
refreshing
and
tasty
definitely
recommended
poured
a
cold
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
very
dark
amber
or
copper
color
pours
with
a
fingernails
worth
of
frothy
head
smells
outstanding
very
hoppy
scent
with
citrus
and
maybe
honey
undertones
tastes
great
the
beer
is
hoppy
but
not
bitter
has
some
grapefruit
flavor
and
it
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
aftertaste
stays
for
a
while
however
you
get
a
small
alcohol
aftertaste
but
it
is
not
bad
medium
carbonation
but
not
too
much
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
troegs
has
a
high
quality
line
of
brews
and
this
beer
will
not
dissapoint
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
for
malt
heads
and
hop
heads
alike
the
hops
make
their
presence
felt
in
the
nose
more
than
in
the
taste
and
they
are
subdued
enough
on
the
palate
that
they
shouldnt
overly
offend
the
malt
heads
this
is
a
quintessential
session
beer
in
my
opinion
i
love
this
beer
i
love
troegs
has
a
nice
clear
amber
hue
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
dies
down
to
a
layer
that
stays
throughout
stickiness
is
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
such
a
sugary
hop
odor
pleases
the
nose
that
mixes
well
with
a
very
mild
pine
scent
a
touch
of
bready
aroma
is
thrown
in
there
as
well
taste
is
a
spicy
hop
tingle
up
front
that
mixes
well
with
a
caramel
malt
and
proceeds
to
end
with
a
crisp
citrus
bite
hopback
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
as
well
drinkability
is
scary
good
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
before
i
even
realized
it
troegs
is
easily
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
please
begin
to
distribute
in
new
york
is
it
really
so
much
to
ask
for
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
medium
in
the
carbonation
solid
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
great
almost
leaves
a
little
alcohol
flavor
at
the
end
and
a
little
carbonated
if
it
was
a
work
night
i
can
see
the
whole
sixer
gone
the
6
is
nicely
hidden
d
very
tasty
goes
down
extremely
easily
not
very
filling
similar
to
nugget
nectar
the
only
thing
keeping
this
beer
from
being
an
american
ipa
is
the
fact
that
troegs
doesnt
call
it
an
ipa
that
being
said
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
whole
lot
of
it
in
an
evening
if
only
troegs
were
available
this
far
in
the
northeast
hinthint
pours
clear
amber
with
12
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
almost
nothing
nice
sweet
hoppy
smell
which
is
slightly
floral
sweet
malty
initial
flavor
with
medium
hop
bitterness
and
a
nice
balance
clean
dry
finish
with
floral
hop
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
ale
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
it
is
surprisingly
hoppy
and
i
would
probably
guess
ipa
if
i
were
blindfolded
with
the
low
abv
and
tame
not
boring
by
any
means
taste
it
goes
down
quite
well
not
quite
their
nugget
nectar
but
definitely
a
goto
yearround
very
good
beer
to
savor
and
to
session
if
so
desired
notes
a
tasty
amber
with
some
bite
too
bad
troegs
doesnt
distribute
in
ny
id
hit
them
up
more
often
the
beer
poured
a
rich
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
of
some
caramel
malts
and
sweet
citrus
hops
the
taste
was
of
great
citrus
hops
in
the
initial
with
a
profound
sweetness
that
completely
overpowers
the
hops
in
the
finish
this
makes
for
a
beer
balanced
in
a
truly
unique
way
the
beer
is
very
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
make
a
wonderful
session
beer
medium
bodied
with
little
notable
carbonation
in
the
mouth
a
nice
beer
if
youre
planning
on
having
a
few
with
the
guys
very
nice
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
hefty
malt
notes
that
spar
well
with
upstart
hops
though
finish
them
off
in
the
end
balanced
more
towards
the
malty
side
if
you
missed
it
in
the
last
sentence
floral
and
slight
fruit
hop
flavors
give
the
brew
a
nice
slickness
to
it
medium
to
full
bodied
especially
for
the
style
another
great
one
from
troegshavent
been
disappointed
yet
by
them
d
one
of
the
tastier
amber
ales
that
i
have
tried
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
sessionable
i
had
the
priviledge
of
trying
this
beer
at
the
brewery
and
it
is
even
better
on
tap
recommend
bottle
into
a
mug
pours
an
amber
color
crystal
clear
twoinch
head
nice
and
billowy
and
takes
its
time
going
away
nice
looking
aromas
come
out
a
couple
feet
away
from
the
beer
mostly
hoppy
smell
spices
lots
of
grapefruit
tastewise
hops
get
you
up
front
and
then
again
even
stronger
in
the
long
aftertaste
lots
of
grapefruit
again
malt
a
touch
in
the
start
but
more
so
in
the
middle
although
its
still
fairly
mild
feel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
i
really
like
this
one
im
not
sure
why
but
id
been
hesitant
to
try
troegs
this
one
really
surprised
me
in
a
good
way
a
really
nice
american
ipa
i
had
high
hopes
of
this
one
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
or
my
mouth
had
a
bad
day
drinkability
the
aforementioned
fade
in
the
bitterness
actually
enhances
the
drinkability
and
accessibility
of
this
amber
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
out
on
the
deck
during
the
early
evening
in
the
summertime
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
just
one
or
two
or
enjoying
it
all
night
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
tannish
creamy
head
some
nice
little
islands
and
sticky
lacing
followed
the
nose
is
sweet
hoppy
citrusy
and
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
very
nice
hoppy
and
citrusy
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
from
troegs
highly
recommended
the
beer
poured
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
it
smell
of
hops
the
hops
are
full
throughout
the
taste
and
stronger
in
the
aftertaste
but
still
balanced
with
the
malt
the
beer
was
not
overly
carbonated
and
lingered
on
the
tongue
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
drinkability
what
can
i
say
i
love
this
beer
its
clean
crisp
methodically
crafted
and
has
phenomenal
drinkability
potential
excellent
job
tröegs
cheers
tons
of
floral
hops
in
the
sniff
really
surprising
for
an
amber
ale
and
the
hops
politely
dominate
the
taste
i
get
it

this
a
amber
apa
cross
tasty
lil
brew
that
packs
a
hop
kickin
finish
ill
have
another
wait
i
only
have
onedammit
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
it
had
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
with
slow
retention
it
smelled
quite
hoppy
which
made
me
happy
and
looking
forward
to
a
nice
hoppy
beer
i
was
not
disappointed
hops
were
very
prevalent
in
this
brew
and
the
aftertaste
from
the
hops
was
not
bad
at
all
either
it
was
quite
nice
and
smooth
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
it
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
which
was
not
too
impressive
overall
drinka
bility
is
pretty
good
even
though
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
i
think
its
pretty
good
overall
thicker
mouthfeel
would
have
made
a
real
solid
beer
ive
like
the
three
previous
troegs
beers
ive
had
rugged
trail
nut
brown
and
of
course
troegenator
and
this
one
fits
nicely
on
that
list
drinkability
highly
drinkable
for
a
big
ol
ipa
nice
level
of
alcohol
and
has
no
abbrassive
factors
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
hop
from
the
hopback
but
it
was
still
a
tastey
brew
fairly
sweet
that
must
be
where
the
amber
comes
in
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
candied
oranges
and
citrus
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
but
still
pretty
good
overall
give
it
a
try
a
very
nice
amber
balanced
but
certainly
leans
towards
hop
bitterness
but
sweet
roasted
malt
keep
things
in
line
and
in
character
for
style
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
brew
the
label
says
amber
ale
i
always
think
im
drinking
an
ipa
when
im
enjoying
this
beer
a
wellrounded
brew
for
hopheads
dits
good
stuff
and
it
feels
good
to
be
drinking
a
part
of
pa
i
bought
a
variety
case
and
there
is
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
in
it
and
im
glad
very
good
troegs
pours
a
deep
red
to
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
a
generous
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
very
hoppy
and
fruity
to
me
it
smells
a
lot
like
an
ipa
taste
is
similar
very
hoppy
with
a
bready
malt
its
a
very
light
smooth
drink
easy
to
drink
a
few
definitely
a
good
session
beer
this
ale
poured
a
beautiful
clear
redamber
color
with
tall
fluffy
slightly
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
the
smell
was
a
very
hoppy
aroma
reminiscent
of
stone
with
faint
caramel
coming
through
the
hops
the
taste
was
hoppy
with
strong
bittering
hops
and
floral
hops
it
was
richly
malty
to
balance
the
hops
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
the
hoppy
flavors
lingered
nicely
this
was
a
very
nice
ale
and
was
particularly
good
from
cask
d
would
have
several
of
these
the
composition
of
this
beer
makes
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
with
the
easygoing
flavors
keeping
your
interest
and
not
destroying
your
palate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
really
and
easy
drinkin
amber
ale
that
disappears
quickly
i
like
the
fact
that
this
is
hoppier
than
most
other
ambers
overall
its
just
a
solid
brew
nothing
thats
earth
shattering
but
i
could
see
it
making
a
good
session
d
this
is
in
my
top
10
favorites
so
far
a
very
good
highly
recommended
ipa
troegs
really
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
highly
sessionable
great
flavor
solid
beer
nicely
done
i
have
to
give
this
brew
all
four
ratings
because
its
such
a
well
rounded
very
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
beer
the
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
with
a
foamy
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
smells
of
of
malt
and
grassy
hops
give
this
beer
a
nice
aroma
taste
of
sweet
malts
and
floral
citrus
hops
are
in
balance
with
a
medium
body
mouth
feel
a
very
good
beer
and
a
happy
addition
to
my
sampler
case
tried
this
brew
on
tap
in
york
pa
what
a
surprise
it
poured
an
extremely
bright
red
amber
with
little
head
but
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
great
earthy
smell
the
taste
was
even
better
with
a
perfect
balance
of
citrusy
sweetness
and
a
great
hop
selection
so
satisfyingly
good
and
it
could
be
even
better
bottled
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
im
a
big
american
ipa
fan
and
this
brew
can
stand
up
to
the
best
of
them
good
choice
this
beer
has
a
nice
lingering
mouthfeel
even
with
the
more
muted
flavors
definitely
would
be
a
good
session
brew
quite
drinkable
d
after
the
initial
hopshock
this
beer
quickly
becomes
very
easy
to
drink
the
more
i
drink
the
more
crave
it
unfortunately
the
abv
is
slightly
high
to
session
well
like
the
famous
nugget
nectar
this
is
a
good
good
beer
troegs
does
american
ambers
up
right
and
this
one
will
keep
nn
fans
somewhat
sated
while
we
wait
until
next
years
batch
go
troegs
a
light
pour
into
my
sam
smith
pint
raises
a
very
slight
head
that
rapidly
recedes
to
a
thin
light
tan
glass
ring
the
beers
color
is
a
deep
copper
the
nose
is
full
of
herbal
and
lightly
grassy
hops
balanced
by
a
nice
caramel
scent
not
very
strong
though
the
taste
is
grassy
a
bit
nutty
breadlike
and
perhaps
just
a
bit
toasted
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
to
be
sure
the
mouth
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
a
good
sessioner
if
perhaps
a
little
too
strong
its
nice
to
see
a
craft
brewer
making
an
amber
ale
its
not
something
that
you
usually
see
this
is
a
great
one
and
i
love
troegs
for
it
for
those
of
you
that
are
looking
for
another
good
beer
to
show
to
nonbas
as
i
always
am
this
is
a
good
one
id
think
this
would
be
a
great
transitional
beer
from
the
macro
world
into
the
quality
craft
beer
world
just
like
prima
pils
all
malt
lager
brooklyn
pennant
and
a
few
others
id
drink
this
again
you
better
believe
it
d
this
beer
won
best
local
beer
by
a
philly
magazine
and
im
quickly
identifying
it
as
one
of
my
top
everyday
beers
it
finishes
so
smoothly
and
pairs
well
with
many
food
selections
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
enjoy
it
definitely
suggest
picking
some
up
if
you
have
the
opportunity
highly
drinkable
i
will
add
this
to
my
buy
again
list
especially
when
entertaining
folks
that
need
to
ease
into
hopappreciation
this
is
my
first
sampling
of
troegs
and
now
i
am
very
anxious
to
try
their
ipaapapa
offerings
especially
ontap
recommended
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
in
it
and
ill
probably
follow
this
one
up
with
an
other
thanks

this
was

consumed
fairly
faint
smell
but
traces
of
malt
rather
than
hops
the
taste
is
quite
good
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
at
the
front
of
the
palate
but
quickly
some
pleasant
not
too
sharp
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
immediately
a
transition
into
a
sweet
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
some
lingering
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
starts
a
little
slick
but
quickly
drys
out
and
ends
up
quite
refreshing
hoppier
and
maltier
than
many
ambers
but
eminently
drinkable
my
first
troegs
was
a
good
one
heres
another
incredible
brew
by
troegs
this
is
an
odd
beer
to
categorize
as
it
tastes
like
a
red
amber
but
is
extremely
hoppy
id
just
call
it
a
red
apa
quite
similar
to
their
pale
ale
a
little
bolder
and
aggressively
hoppy
malts
and
hops
are
the
dominance
and
again
in
true
troegs
fashion
an
incredibly
dry
smooth
drinkability
with
no
after
taste
whatsoever
it
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
highly
recommended
drinkability
highly
drinkable
pleasingly
complete
sensually
enlivening
thirst
quenching
and
satisfying
a
fine
beer
d
wow
im
in
love
with
another
troegs
brewery
they
are
certainly
one
of
the
most
underated
breweries
in
the
country
definitely
pick
up
a
6er
of
this
if
you
havent
had
it
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nugget
nectar
but
not
quite
the
same
quality
very
balanced
beer
with
a
smooth
maltiness
and
not
overbearing
yet
tasty
hop
flavor
excellent
balance
between
these
2
with
a
nice
smooth
buthop
finish
clean
beer
overall
could
be
considered
in
the
ipa
category
i
enjoy
it
was
very
glad
to
find
it
in
the
local
liquor
store
overall
a
good
beer
and
recommended
this
beer
paired
well
with
internet
porn
pours
a
dark
amber
red
when
held
to
the
light
and
with
a
dense
long
lasting
head
and
plenty
of
aroma
cascadelike
hops
in
the
scent
and
flavor
with
others
blended
in
for
the
bittering
exeptionally
clean
mouthfeel
with
subsequent
splendid
drinkability
tastes
like
pine
resin
and
citrus
with
a
sweet
malty
undertone
not
super
hoppy
or
bitter
as
the
name
would
imply
but
the
hops
taste
very
fresh
and
green
i
think
the
brewer
must
have
used
whole
flower
hops
to
achieve
this
or
something
because
these
hops
taste
fresh
picked
my
first
troegs
beer
that
umlaut
is
redundant
and
diminutive
and
its
a
winner
ok
the
are
bros
advocates
of
the
ganja
as
well
none
of
the
troegs
beers
are
listed
with
with
accurate
abv
i
found
that
this
works
quite
nicely
as
a
beer
to
use
in
beer
batter
for
fish
n
chips
add
a
dash
of
this
to
a
creole
mayo
to
accompany
your
fish
n
chips
of
course
you
might
as
well
drink
one
of
these
while
frying
your
fish
and
what
better
to
pair
with
said
fish
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
this
style
has
a
whole
lot
of
varience
but
this
one
really
seems
to
stand
above
most
others
but
between
the
balance
and
hops
used
this
really
reminds
me
of
an
esb
as
well
great
amber
ale
i
wish
they
all
had
the
kind
of
umph
that
this
one
does
this
beer
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
red
beer
the
color
is
lighter
than
you
would
expect
from
a
red
beer
there
was
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
as
i
said
before
the
taste
is
like
an
ipa
i
guess
its
more
of
an
ipa
amber
ale
blend
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
i
could
drink
these
over
and
over
a
good
beer
yeah
the
beer
is
sweet
up
front
which
accents
the
citrusy
hop
character
the
hops
have
a
tight
grip
on
the
palate
sharp
and
herbal
with
a
solid
bitterness
that
lingers
on
through
to
a
long
finish
this
is
nicely
hoppy
just
what
i
needed
this
afternoon
fairly
malty
as
well
with
a
solid
backdrop
which
helps
to
accentuate
and
balance
out
the
hops
both
a
malt
sweetness
and
a
toasted
almost
baked
malt
character
quite
a
tasty
beer
and
as
is
the
sign
of
any
good
beer
it
seems
to
disappear
from
my
glass
long
before
i
want
it
to
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
pushes
the
limits
of
an
amber
and
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
an
apa
either
way
its
damn
good
my
wife
brought
this
back
for
me
from
pa
has
a
good
lightbrown
head
and
true
amber
color
as
expected
aroma
has
a
good
bit
of
malt
and
hops
some
typical
hops
aromas
resin
pine
citrus
but
not
overpowering
leave
that
to
the
nugget
nectart
overal
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
amber
ales
but
this
is
pretty
good
this
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
ive
had
wish
i
had
more
good
solid
drinking
beer
here
but
it
is
a
little
too
malty
and
dry
in
the
end
to
get
a
really
great
drinkability
rating
this
is
a
rather
full
flavored
and
bodied
beer
that
just
isnt
all
that
after
the
first
hop
burp
you
realize
just
how
rich
this
really
is
nice
beer
though
would
go
great
with
sausage
and
dumplings
pours
a
bourbonlike
brown
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
to
thin
cap
hops
dominate
the
nose
maybe
a
hint
of
caramel
as
well
taste
starts
off
slighly
sweet
with
malts
then
the
hops
come
out
but
not
overpowering
at
all
great
balance
here
medium
bodied
brew
that
doesnt
coat
the
mouth
as
one
might
guess
by
the
color
and
very
easy
to
drink
great
brew
all
in
all
a
good
offering
not
sure
id
move
it
into
heavy
rotation
but
i
certainly
could
throw
a
few
back
in
short
order
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
the
beer
is
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
has
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
feeling
a
very
drinkable
beer
treat
overall
i
will
be
sad
to
see
the
last
of
my
case
drank
up
i
got
this
beer
a
couple
months
ago
for
the
first
time
actually
completely
by
accident
it
turned
out
in
my
favor
this
beer
has
a
great
color
and
an
even
better
taste
it
has
a
strong
hop
taste
the
thing
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
was
how
my
mouth
felt
afterwards
however
great
accident
great
beer
and
ive
had
it
a
few
times
since
d
has
a
nice
flavor
with
the
fruity
sweetness
and
hops
striking
a
nice
balance
one
could
take
a
couple
of
these
at
6
as
well
overall
quite
good
hoppy
but
not
enough
to
be
overwhelming
or
keep
you
from
wanting
another
one
or
two
or
three
nice
beer
usually
when
i
see
amber
i
expect
a
maltier
beer
although
malt
was
present
in
the
taste
it
was
countered
nicely
by
the
hops
similar
hop
taste
and
smell
as
their
nugget
nectar
very
earthy
and
spicy
really
good
beer
nice
medium
amber
color
with
a
dense
head
of
foam
but
that
died
fairly
quickly
easy
drinking
brew
drinkability
easily
quaffable
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
but
not
noticable
at
all
very
tasty
and
not
too
heavy
im
already
looking
for
a
secod
12
ounce
bottle
troegs
hopback
amber
pours
out
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
toasted
malt
and
sweet
caramel
with
fresh
hops
in
the
background
flavor
is
bready
malt
with
caramel
and
a
surpisingly
large
dose
of
hops
slightly
fruity
with
some
raisin
notes
just
a
hint
of
smoke
fresh
citrus
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
but
the
beer
is
still
quite
drinkable
terrific
balance
even
an
older
bottle
loses
little
of
the
fresh
hop
flavor
a
fine
example
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
looking
light
amber
very
clear
good
size
head
that
dont
last
too
long
ladderlike
lacing
down
the
glass
good
aroma
of
hops
not
that
strong
but
definitely
worth
savoring
taste
was
very
good
definite
hops
but
overall
smoothbalanced
taste
so
that
the
hops
are
not
overpowering
also
detected
some
hint
of
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
rich
carbonation
about
right
i
was
surprised
at
the
6
0
abf
when
i
logged
on
didnt
see
it
on
the
bottle
i
would
consider
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
very
high
if
this
beer
was
generally
available
on
tap
in
tidewater
va
i
would
rate
it
above
yeungling
but
still
below
snpa
my
staple
beers
to
ask
for
this
would
also
be
a
good
beer
to
help
deprogram
a
bmc
drinker
served
on
tap
last
night
at
tysons
in
baltimore
pours
a
yellowish
amber
with
a
finger
of
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
citrus
aroma
very
hoppy
with
a
grapefruitcitrus
lean
but
with
a
caramel
backbone
to
boot
the
nonbeer
geeks
refered
to
it
as
refreshing
well
worth
several
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
finger
of
creamy
offwhite
head
reduces
quickly
to
a
lingering
cap
that
leaves
behind
some
nice
big
curtains
of
lace
smell
is
a
nice
and
fairly
strong
bouquet
of
flowery
hops
with
a
slight
citric
twang
and
a
slight
caramel
malt
taste
is
a
moderate
caramel
malt
balanced
very
nicely
by
the
hops
more
floral
in
the
middle
and
with
the
fruity
citrus
coming
throuh
on
the
finish
body
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
and
the
carbonation
could
be
crisper
the
mouthfeels
the
only
thing
that
really
detracts
from
this
beer
this
is
a
nice
offering
hoppier
and
tastier
than
most
ambers
ive
had
very
easy
drinking
cheers
uf
all
in
all
a
very
nice
sessionable
offering
that
i
have
to
thank
froggyfrog
for
easy
to
drink
but
too
light
for
me
both
in
hoppiness
and
in
body
probably
an
ok
session
and
probably
much
better
on
tap
the
citric
and
floral
hops
are
quite
complex
and
noticeable
for
the
style
but
in
no
way
over
the
top
in
fact
i
find
the
level
of
maltiness
to
be
up
to
the
task
of
balancing
the
hops
making
for
a
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
allows
you
to
enjoy
the
hops
without
singing
off
your
taste
buds
ipastyle
the
body
was
a
bit
on
the
lean
side
but
not
to
the
point
of
detracting
from
the
brew
and
probably
only
increases
its
prowess
as
a
fine
session
ale
no
complaints
this
one
is
a
good
ipa
that
will
match
up
to
most
other
domestic
micro
ipas
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
dense
foam
head
that
falls
to
a
table
and
leave
some
bubbly
lacing
gorgeous
in
the
glass
smells
like
a
hoppy
brew
with
a
light
malt
background
but
the
taste
reverses
that
with
a
bready
malt
beginning
and
a
light
balance
of
hops
tasty
and
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
high
worthy
of
a
regular
purchase
have
it
on
hand
for
your
beer
related
needs
final
thought
wow
this
is
in
the
top
tier
of
ales
in
my
book
earns
its
place
on
my
beer
mantle
this
beer
pours
a
bright
copper
orange
with
a
very
uniform
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
earth
sour
hops
limes
and
grassy
grains
with
a
little
bit
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
very
dynamic
with
a
pasty
and
smooth
honey
and
molasses
malt
coupled
with
a
separate
green
grape
skin
dryness
nice
transition
of
flavors
here
the
finish
is
sweet
smoky
and
eartyh
mouth
feel
is
simple
with
a
medium
body
and
slight
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
easy
much
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
just
without
that
special
extra
something
you
could
have
many
of
these
in
a
row
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
sixpack
drinkability
overall
a
fine
effort
that
shows
that
an
amber
ale
doesnt
have
to
be
boring
a
copper
colored
beer
with
a
redhue
head
that
has
good
retention
but
leaves
behind
little
lacing
i
can
smell
sugar
hops
and
honey
sweet
scents
seem
to
dominate
this
beers
aroma
profile
the
taste
is
a
welcome
blend
of
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
as
is
typical
for
this
style
the
alcohol
is
not
apparent
in
the
taste
or
the
aftertaste
in
addition
the
finish
is
a
bit
sour
with
a
lingering
sweetness
that
sits
in
the
back
of
my
throat
a
wellbalanced
beer
with
excellent
drinkability
and
taste
troegs
brews
impress
once
again
really
really
nice
stuff
if
i
were
to
choose
a
favorite
beer
that
i
drank
exclusively
this
would
be
a
top
contender
id
definitely
want
it
to
come
with
me
in
the
shipwrecked
on
a
deserted
island
scenario
id
love
to
try
it
cask
conditioned
and
ill
be
sure
to
grab
a
case
of
bottles
next
time
im
in
pa
or
nj
im
a
sucker
for
great
session
beers
ive
had
hundreds
and
this
is
a
stand
out
this
was
on
cask
at
andys
corner
bar
on
a
recent
nj
business
trip
it
poured
into
the
shaker
pint
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
great
retention
the
nose
had
nice
citrus
hop
grapefruit
with
a
little
grass
and
hay
the
flavor
has
grapefruit
rind
hay
and
a
little
hop
flower
extremely
light
and
slick
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
pint
at
phyrst
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
nose
is
dominated
by
spicy
hops
taste
is
very
hoppy
as
well
there
is
a
nice
malt
backbone
but
the
hops
hit
almost
immediately
and
persist
through
to
the
finish
very
nice
medium
to
thick
mouthful
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
yet
another
eastern
treasure
sent
westward
by
mntlover
d
this
beer
is
very
good
all
around
smell
could
be
better
but
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
its
top
notch
would
go
well
with
almost
any
meal
or
as
a
session
beer
definitely
a
must
try
another
great
troegs
beer
i
finally
got
back
to
my
beer
after
a
few
days
of
gastritis
caused
no
doubt
by
the
pitcher
of
swill
from
my
previous
rating
and
found
this
beer
to
be
a
nice
mellow
transition
back
to
real
beers
pours
a
big
country
cream
head
over
a
pretty
amber
body
the
head
turns
rocky
as
it
starts
to
fade
the
hops
are
clearly
of
an
american
ipa
mode
piney
more
than
citrusey
the
bitterness
is
pleasing
more
than
bitter
for
its
own
sake
and
matches
up
well
with
a
smooth
caramel
malt
kudos
thanks
to
this
site
and
your
reviews
like
i
said
im
new
at
this
but
i
think
ive
already
taken
a
big
step
up
cheers
had
this
out
of
a
16
at
home
it
poured
a
nice
clear
deep
amber
with
a
big
off
white
head
that
was
present
for
the
whole
glass
it
has
a
sweet
smell
like
caramel
with
some
piney
hops
starts
sweet
big
caramel
flavor
then
the
hops
give
some
bitter
bite
but
not
over
the
top
the
after
taste
is
all
sweet
malts
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
really
easy
going
down
nice
drinkable
beer
i
usually
dont
like
amber
ales
because
they
are
too
sweet
but
this
one
was
just
right
this
is
really
smooth
drinkable
session
beer
hops
are
mentioned
in
the
beers
name
but
its
not
a
superhoppy
beer
at
all
actually
the
hops
character
is
nicely
balanced
by
some
sweetness
fruits
and
malt
worth
trying
when
you
want
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
beer
after
beer
for
one
this
beer
is
the
perfect
color
amber
if
it
crystalized
i
could
sell
it
as
jewlery
it
has
a
nice
lasting
white
chunky
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
lots
ohops
full
fragerant
floral
a
touch
citrus
a
touch
piney
with
some
sweet
malt
sneaking
though
and
a
little
yeast
too
the
taste
was
a
little
confused
though
nice
malt
base
bold
and
assertive
with
a
little
alcohol
but
the
hops
seem
to
go
in
different
directions
and
the
bitterness
was
grassy
it
had
a
good
body
but
overall
the
beer
was
decent
in
the
bottle
probably
much
better
on
tap

the
bottle
poured
a
nice
amber
with
a
off
white
head
aroma
hops
and
a
small
amout
of
malts
a
touch
of
citrus
like
lemon
floral
flavor
gotta
like
the
hops
nice
and
mild
and
the
malts
blend
in
there
nicely
satisfied
the
hop
craving
id
like
to
finish
by
saying
im
proud
that
i
live
4
miles
away
from
this
awesome
brewery
always
look
forward
to
drinking
troegs
great
local
beer
the
pleasure
of
this
brew
starts
with
the
pour
and
goes
all
the
way
to
staring
at
the
lace
on
the
side
of
the
empty
glass
the
color
is
a
classic
amber
with
an
ample
offwhite
head
the
nose
powers
through
with
sweet
malt
and
piney
hops
the
front
end
reminds
of
an
american
ipa
but
continues
with
a
more
moderate
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
mild
spicy
aftertaste
the
malt
was
buttery
caramel
and
it
bit
nutty
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
prickly
though
that
may
have
due
to
drinking
it
at
about
40
degrees
my
first
thought
was
i
need
to
have
another
highly
recommended
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
amber
as
it
gets
very
good
reviews
on
here
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
taste
reminds
me
of
a
lageraleipa
instead
of
an
amber
a
decent
beer
but
falls
even
outside
a
catch
all
style
like
this
a
lovely
amber
amber
with
golden
highlights
didnt
get
much
head
out
of
my
pours
very
nice
clean
piney
hops
scent
with
a
pleasant
hop
bite
taste
with
a
perfect
malt
balance
slighty
candy
undertone
sweetens
clean
smooth
a
little
chewy
but
not
overly
puckering
the
combination
adds
up
to
an
all
day
drinker
this
is
one
goddam
good
beer
a
slammer
one
of
my
favorite
apas
in
the
whole
country
again
another
easytodrink
troeg
mellow
if
not
on
the
hoppy
side
and
may
very
well
be
a
top
american
amber
very
well
crafted
try
some
a
rough
pour
produced
a
moderately
thick
dense
dirty
cream
colored
that
faded
slowly
to
a
film
leaving
a
sheet
of
lace
behind
aroma
of
candied
grapefruit
and
spring
flowers
i
almost
sneezed
transparent
dark
copper
colored
beer
with
a
few
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
around
the
bottom
solid
malt
backbone
tastes
like
caramel
and
toasted
malt
its
joined
by
doses
of
sweat
tea
and
grapefruit
the
finish
is
mildly
sweet
not
bitter
as
i
had
expected
the
body
is
nice
and
light
making
for
a
refreshing
beer
a
full
flavored
beer
with
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malt
its
sweet
but
more
of
a
candiedsugary
sweet
then
the
thick
gooey
cloying
sweetness
a
perfect
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
awesome
goes
down
smooth
easy
and
agreeable
i
have
brought
down
from
pa
three
cases
of
this
over
time
still
hadnt
reviewed
it
sad
i
know
anyway
i
just
got
a
sixer
sent
from
a
friend
in
pa
i
also
had
a
bottle
here
from
the
last
time
i
purchased
a
case
likely
9
months
ago
the
major
difference
was
in
the
aroma
and
the
body
the
aroma
was
not
as
strong
and
the
mouthfeelbody
lent
more
texture
to
the
beer
but
wasnt
bad
in
any
way
just
an
interesting
note
drinkability
not
too
bad
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
ive
been
told
by
others
that
this
beer
was
pretty
good
so
maybe
a
fresher
representation
would
warrant
an
edit
very
clear
crystal
clear
but
little
head
after
a
vigourous
pouring
the
aroma
is
nice
seems
heavier
on
malty
notes
than
hops
with
a
little
licorice
and
candy
note
there
as
well
flavor
follows
through
too
not
overwhelming
but
a
nicely
balanced
blend
of
spicey
hops
with
some
cinnamon
aspect
noticed
wonder
what
hop
that
is
and
a
slight
bitterness
complimented
with
maltiness
and
some
caramel
notes
a
good
drinking
beer
would
make
a
good
session
beer
except
the
abv
may
shorten
your
session
somewhat
prematurely
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
to
this
it
seems
to
be
very
sticky
initially
but
washes
down
well
leaving
only
a
hint
of
what
was
just
tasted
drinkability
would
be
excellent
and
the
beer
almost
demands
it
with
its
dry
taste
i
think
that
if
this
was
more
available
that
i
would
have
a
new
session
beer
nice
reddish
amber
ale
with
great
flavor
decent
size
head
which
stays
around
for
a
long
time
just
like
the
flavor
not
a
very
hoppy
ale
but
a
great
mix
of
malt
and
hops
has
a
slightly
sweet
taste
the
smell
of
the
malt
and
citrus
fruits
is
quite
strong
and
quite
appealing
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
after
a
friend
recommended
troegs
to
me
looks
like
ill
have
to
go
back
to
him
for
some
more
recommendatons
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
the
head
was
small
but
had
good
retention
and
a
some
slight
lacing
going
down
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
the
taste
really
brings
out
some
spicyness
from
the
hops
fairly
easy
on
the
palate
with
a
slight
dry
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
but
very
drinkable
a
fine
brew
and
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
some
other
kinds
of
their
beer
in
the
future
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
reddish
clay
in
color
nice
thick
foamy
head
with
lots
of
lace
nose
is
all
grass
taste
is
wonderfully
balanced
sweet
malts
combined
with
nice
hop
additions
that
bring
out
some
grapefruit
with
the
aftertaste
is
a
reminder
of
the
grain
that
went
into
the
beer
slightly
more
than
medium
body
very
pleasant
drinking
a
very
nice
looking
beer
amber
with
a
touch
of
red
and
a
thin
white
head
has
a
strong
aroma
of
citiusy
hops
it
smells
like
they
did
use
a
hop
back
on
this
brew
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
leaning
toward
the
hop
side
being
a
hop
head
the
hop
presence
could
be
stonger
a
good
drinking
beer
for
the
summer
which
is
why
i
went
for
the
half
keg
living
60
miles
from
troegs
i
well
aware
of
their
beers
and
they
are
all
pretty
good
drinkability
solid
session
amber
thanks
to
merlin48
for
a
fine
bottle
o
brew
definitely
recommended
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
barely
any
head
but
a
very
active
life
of
carbonation
color
glows
beautifully
in
my
glass
scent
is
explosively
floral
honey
soaked
hops
fruitier
than
it
is
buttery
aroma
is
light
and
inviting
flavor
is
very
fresh
and
botanical
in
nature
a
ryeish
maltish
smoothness
invades
half
of
the
flavor
here
fruity
sweet
meets
hop
bitter
in
the
finish
with
a
rounded
smoothness
light
and
bubbly
drinkably
refreshing
a
good
example
of
a
flavorful
session
beer
if
not
a
little
maniacal
in
its
execution
a
real
solid
everyday
drinkable
beer
highly
drinkable
ultratasty
stuff
im
glad
tröegs
is
somewhat
local
very
refreshing
an
exceedingly
drinkable
i
love
this
stuff
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
the
body
is
an
orangeyamber
with
a
1
finger
head
that
is
offwhite
and
leaves
decent
lacing
very
fruity
in
the
nose
pineapple
grapefruit
and
mangoes
along
with
some
pine
needles
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
on
the
palate
and
the
pine
grapefruit
and
pineapple
dominate
but
there
are
traces
of
more
fruits
mangoes
cherries
the
malts
eventually
contribute
notes
of
biscuits
and
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
gets
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
as
does
the
alcohol
flavor
very
smooth
with
significant
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
that
thickens
as
you
near
the
end
of
the
glass
very
tasty
and
not
too
bad
on
the
wallet
the
aroma
is
a
hoppy
grapefruit
flavor
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
not
overly
bitter
but
has
a
nice
hoppy
taste
with
hints
of
citrus
flavor
there
is
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
this
is
not
one
of
the
strong
hopped
up
ales
i
have
had
but
a
mild
version
of
an
ipa
note
was
able
to
retry
this
one
freshly
tapped
within
7
days
and
it
was
noticably
better
which
is
saying
something
for
a
beer
this
good
dont
be
afraid
to
ask
how
long
the
barrel
has
been
tapped
it
made
a
noticable
difference
in
the
fruit
undercurrants
of
this
this
is
exactly
what
i
expect
from
an
amber
ale
a
very
good
example
thanks
to
merlin48
for
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
hops
lots
of
different
types
but
they
arent
too
much
as
they
would
be
in
a
double
ipa
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
in
it
mostly
covering
up
the
malts
but
again
the
hops
arent
too
strong
just
well
proportioned
moderate
in
body
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
thanks
to
merlin48
for
this
beer
this
one
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
caramel
slightly
buttery
and
citrusy
hops
i
think
it
smells
really
nice
the
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
nose
the
hop
is
a
little
more
floral
and
spicey
on
the
taste
and
the
caramel
is
more
strong
on
the
finish
i
like
it
the
feel
is
thick
with
a
moderate
carb
overall
i
think
this
is
a
well
built
beer
i
like
the
flavor
a
lot
the
hops
are
really
nice
with
the
sweet
and
slightly
butteryness
underneath
thanks
to
francis
and
ericaweizen
for
the
sample
there
isnt
anything
all
that
special
about
this
beer
but
its
just
a
wellbalanced
tasty
beverage
that
i
would
recommend
trying
a
real
stand
out
beer
in
a
style
with
95
boring
beers
pouring
into
my
pint
glass
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
reddish
highlights
minimal
head
w
slight
edge
lacing
and
very
clean
however
nothing
exciting
really
aroma
is
mainly
of
hops
hops
hops
some
vanilla
malts
come
through
a
bit
as
well
and
maybe
some
type
of
citrus
fruit
lemons
maybe
however
the
hops
takes
over
for
the
most
part
bitter
hops
and
a
slight
grape
sweetness
is
the
highlight
of
the
sip
grapefruits
or
lemons
also
come
through
overall
very
citrussy
and
piney
feel
is
nice
very
carbonated
throughout
but
due
to
its
lighttomedium
body
i
found
it
a
slight
bit
creamy
and
smooth
little
alcohol
burn
and
a
slight
pine
aftertaste
finish
this
one
up
overall
not
the
most
complex
of
troegs
brews
but
very
fun
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
thanks
to
fellow
ba
jayt
for
bringing
me
some
brews
this
one
was
a
true
clear
light
amber
but
even
when
i
poured
it
myself
the
small
12
inch
head
left
quickly
aroma
is
interesting
very
strong
more
grapefruit
than
grassy
hops
tastewise
i
am
picking
up
on
strong
grapefruit
smelling
hops
that
have
an
interesting
haylike
quality
as
well
mouhhfeel
is
medium
carbonation
is
low
alcohol
would
like
to
hide
but
i
can
tell
this
one
isnt
a
session
beer
an
excellent
by
itself
or
with
food
overallspectacular
the
first
beer
ive
ever
given
a
flawless
rating
to
im
absolutely
floored
great
work
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
foamy
2finger
beige
head
that
drops
to
a
light
collar
but
stays
until
the
glass
is
done
very
nice
lacing
as
well
smells
very
fresh
and
clean
very
hoppy
has
hints
grass
floral
and
spicy
hops
they
all
combine
very
well
for
a
great
smell
honestly
i
wish
i
could
have
this
smell
in
a
glade
plugitin
tastes
wonderful
absolutly
superb
a
nice
caramel
hops
flavor
up
front
with
light
hops
in
the
back
so
obviously
the
name
hopback
makes
sense
finishes
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
caramel
and
hops
abound
the
malts
and
hops
blean
beautifully
to
create
a
complex
and
fabulously
drinkable
beer
well
done
this
is
the
third
of
my
troegs
sample
pack
and
so
far
the
best
try
this
and
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
troegs
doesnt
brew
bad
beer
hopback
amber
is
a
wonderful
ale
that
keeps
these
guys
solidly
in
my
top
dozen
american
breweries
the
first
of
many
from
blitheringidiot
thanks
man
pours
ambery
reddish
color
with
a
light
beige
head
subtle
piney
floral
hop
aroma
and
some
malt
sweetness
present
too
botanical
and
malty
sweet
up
front
then
dryness
from
the
hops
and
finishing
with
a
faint
lingering
sweetness
rather
like
sweetened
tea
slightly
astringent
and
a
mild
metallic
oxidized
flavor
in
the
background
but
easy
to
drink
i
must
admit
that
i
was
a
little
disappointed
when
troegs
decided
to
part
ways
with
their
esb
in
order
to
make
this
beer
but
its
a
worthy
substitute
i
didnt
really
like
the
caskconditioned
version
of
this
beer
but
the
bottle
is
enjoyable
my
first
troegs
offering
thanks
to
ted
for
bringing
it
back
from
his
recent
trip
to
pa
appearance
is
excellent
a
medium
amber
chunky
head
and
great
lacing
smell
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
malts
and
fruity
hops
taste
is
a
palates
delight
starts
lightly
sweet
on
the
front
lessens
on
the
mid
palate
and
finishes
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
finish
moouthfeel
is
moist
and
smooth
throughout
and
not
overly
oily
or
dry
on
the
finish
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
defintely
could
have
another
i
have
three
others
from
troegs
to
try
and
if
they
are
anything
like
this
offering
i
may
take
a
trip
to
pa

all

well
done
and
worth
seeking
out
saw
this
an
cask
at
the
sharp
edge
emporium
in
pittsburgh
and
told
the
barkeep
to
pull
me
pint
little
did
i
know
this
would
take
some
time
about
ten
minutes
to
be
exact
i
waited
patiently
as
he
readied
the
pint
he
told
me
that
it
had
not
been
pouring
well
but
the
taste
was
fine
i
said
ok
the
appearence
was
a
creamy
amber
with
a
mountainous
head
that
you
could
cut
with
a
knife
the
smell
was
much
more
raw
than
that
of
the
bottle
or
an
tap
samples
a
very
hoppy
nose
with
a
sweet
malty
earthy
back
taste
was
creamy
hoppy
floral
but
more
subdued
than
i
had
expected
the
malts
in
this
ale
seemed
to
come
through
more
on
cask
mothfeel
was
almost
free
of
carbonation
and
heavier
than
other
serving
types
ive
tried
the
lack
of
carbonation
kind
of
threw
me
at
first
it
seemed
to
take
away
the
bite
from
the
hops
but
delicicous
nonetheless
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
more
than
one
or
two
on
cask
at
any
given
time
price6
a
draft
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
lowered
my
drinkability
slightly
very
much
enjoyed
i
needs
to
gets
me
some

the

the

rounds
out
the
aroma
for
an

beer
nirvana
one
of
the
finest
brews
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
rich
and
full
of
character
this
beer
in
a
cask
conditioned
incarnation
is
one
ill
look
forward
to
having
again
if
you
ever
see
this
in
a
cask
try
it
cask
version
at
fat

in
pittsburgh
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a

foamy

the

outstanding
citrus

malt
caramel
and

very
smooth

with
a
strong
floral
hops
flavor
followed
by
malt
and
spice
the
finish
is
slick
and
earthy
hops
and
malt
this
beer
is
definitely
enjoyable
on
the
cask
id
like
to
try
the
bottled
version
too
nice
deep
malty
tastemouth
feel
that
is
backed
up
by
and
washes
down
with
a
nice
lucid
neither
overpowering
or
clean
and
strong
citrus
flavor
and
a
solidly
crisp
finish
nothing
is
overpowering
tastewise
and
everything
complements
each
other
nicely
and
makes
for
perfect
drinkablility
when
looking
for
it
ng
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
thick
12of
light
beige
head
which
laced
ok
aroma
is
mainly
of
hops
but
the
malt
is
also
evident
just
in
the
minority
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
as
the
nose
did
not
lead
me
to
think
this
would
be
as
wellbalanced
as
it
is
hops
is
upfront
but
the
flavor
profile
is
quickly
rounded
out
by
an
appropriate
amount
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
good
and
that
little
aftertaste
of
hops
is
great
just
like
you
want
drinkability
is
excellent
plenty
going
on
this
brew
so
as
not
to
bore
the
taste
buds
very
nice
find
this
weekend
in
state
college
at
the
phyrst
this
beer
must
have
been
mighty
fresh
had
a
nice
hop
nose
but
the
juicy
round
phat
fruity
hop
flavors
in
this
beer
make
it
really
very
nice
very
fresh
fruity
juicy
hop
flavor
very
drinkable
as
well
the
hopback
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
receded
significantly
still
the
surface
of
the
beer
remained
a
thin
yet
frothy
consistency
throughout
some
nice
lacing
along
the
glass
heavy
floral
and
fruity
smell
with
a
deeper
aroma
than
expected
very
appealing
just
the
right
amount
of
caramel
peeks
out
through
the
strong
hopsmalt
competition
to
add
a
nice
touch
fairly
malty
but
bitter
enough
to
satisfy
nice
aftertaste
too
the
full
sticky
mouthfeel
almost
reminds
me
of
what
an
amber
ale
lollipop
might
taste
like
quite
some
time
after
finishing
this
glass
a
quick
lick
of
the
lips
reminds
me
of
this
fine
beer
very
drinkable
especially
for
this
style
the
hopback
has
become
a
staple
for
me
very
well
done
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
semipersistent
head
the
head
leaves
a
bit
of
sticky
decoration
on
the
glass
a
hoppy
aromaprimarily
citrus
and
floral
notes
comes
nicely
from
the
glass
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
also
is
present
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
quite
goodthe
hops
make
themselves
known
and
are
balanced
by
some
equally
tastey
caramelly
malty
flavors
finishes
with
some
very
nice
bitterness
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
smooth
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
definitely
one
worth
having
again
in
the
future
tröegs
hopback
amber
ale
not
fully
sure
what
this
is
supposed
to
be
it
says
it
an
amber
ale
but
the
name
and
aroma
indicate
that
it
was
much
more
than
a
typical
amber
ale
the
aroma
is
fairly
hoppy
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
malts
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
however
nice
copper
color
decent
off
white
head
with
a
little
bit
of
stickiness
the
taste
is
nice
fairly
floralcitrus
hops
with
a
bready
base
of
malts
clean
aftertaste
with
mild
hop
tastes
nice
and
easy
to
drink
taste
the
flavor
begins
with
a
malt
push
biscuit
caramel
and
butterscotch
are
noticed
the
floral
hops
peak
through
in
the
middle
and
finishes
with
a
citrus
hop
bitterness
at
first
i
thought
the
flavors
were
too
distinct
big
malt
and
then
big
hops
either
go
one
way
or
the
other
but
after
having
this
beer
a
few
more
times
over
a
span
of
a
couple
of
months
i
think
it
is
a
great
blending
of
flavors
extremely
well
balanced
very
smooth
and
hugely
drinkable
a
heavier
session
beer
if
you
will
a
must
have
in
anyones
beer
fridge
this
is
the
only
selection
i
have
given
a
perfect
five
this
is
justified
hopback
is
my
favorite
selection
from
troegs
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
the
beer
served
oncask
it
blew
me
away
the
nose
was
amazing
in
that
the
hops
were
present
and
similar
to
the
bottle
or
draught
version
but
they
were
subdued
the
head
was
light
and
fluffy
and
lasted
the
entire
duration
of
the
pint
as
this
was
a
caskconditioned
ale
the
carbonation
was
very
low
allowing
for
all
the
flavor
to
present
itself
to
the
drinker
all
the
flavors
of
the
hopback
were
present
but
just
more
balanced
the
beer
was
very
smooth
in
my
mouth
and
actually
made
me
understand
the
purpose
of
cask
ale
props
to
market
cross
pub
in
carlisle
pa
for
taking
care
of
this
cask
and
serving
it
properly
in
an
imperial
pint
beer
is
good
happy
local
beering
beautiful
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
very
thin
head
this
bier
has
a
slight
caramel
flavor
that
complements
the
hoppinesss
of
it
very
well
has
a
very
pleasing
grassy
and
piney
aromas
to
it
especially
as
the
bier
warms
a
little
this
beer
has
overall
a
good
hop
flavor
is
very
enjoyable
also
the
bier
finishes
very
creamy
the
solid
malt
core
helps
balance
the

beautful
clear
reddish
brown
color
but
disappointingly
sparse
head
light
floral
aroma
nice
not
overpowering
there
is
a
strange
aftertaste
that
is
like
hardboiled
eggs
which
i
cannot
understand
and
may
just
be
this
batch
slight
caramel
flavor
light
hoppiness
not
too
strong
as
you
would
expect
from
the
name
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
me
think
of
when
your
milkshake
has
melted
clean
and
dry
finish
decent
drinkability
but
maybe
not
as
a
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
light
crystal
malt
scent
but
the
main
feature
here
is
the
awesome
floral
hop
aroma
that
is
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
great
as
well
this
beer
has
got
some
good
hop
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
creamy
it
also
has
a
solid
malt
core
which
helps
balance
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
this
is
a
medfull
bodied
amber
ale
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
the
best
damn
amber
ale
ive
ever
had
it
has
great
hop
flavor
and
a
complex
mouthfeel
i
love
it
moderate
carbonation
but
an
explosive
head
fantastic
drinkability
id
like
some
more
oelergud
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
falls
to
fine
coat
of
film
that
leaves
light
lacing
a
on
my
mug
smells
of
nice
refreshig
piney
hops
tastes
wonderful
carmel
malt
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
not
over
bitterr
or
flavor
one
could
say
perfection
a
nice
well
balanced
amber
brew
good
medium
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
had
three
wishing
i
had
more
drinkablility
the
same
qualities
that
lowered
the
mouthfeel
score
raise
it
for
drinkability
dry

beer
makes
you
drink
more
always
have
this
on
hand
12oz
bottle
this
one
poured
an
absolutely
crystal
clear
orangishamber
color
it
had
a
decent
head
but
it
went
down
rather
quickly
decent
amount
of
lacing
grapefruit
hops
and
some
spices
to
the
nose
very
smooth
and
dry
to
the
taste
it
has
a
good
hop
bite
with
a
good
malt
backbone
even
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
background
very
nice
notes
i
compared
this
to
the
dfh
brew
above
so
if
youve
had
that
i
will
compare
against
that
i
honestly
feel
that
the
dfh
60
minutes
ipa
is
a
better
drink
the
only
real
reason
i
can
say
that
is
i
experienced
almost
no
bitterness
with
the
60
minute
from
dfh
the
sweetness
in
this
troegs
example
is
very
nice
and
very
substantial
but
i
dont
think
it
is
enough
to
look
over
the
bitter
finish
if
you
enjoy
the
bitters
this
would
be
a
nice
light
drink
for
you
pours
a
clear
copperred
amber
with
a
moderate
beige
head
that
has
nice
retention
followed
by
patchy
lacing
outstanding
aroma
is
like
a
bowl
of
fresh
grapefruit
drenched
with
maple
syrup
notes
of
spruce
pine
compliment
the
profound
hop
bouquet
mouthfeel
is
superlative
as
a
cluster
of
hops
exploded
on
your
tongue
nice
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
feel
taste
is
a
complex
amalgam
of
big
hoppiness
pine
and
citrus
overwhelm
the
caramel
malt
and
other
hoppy
notes
emerge
throughout
the
glassful
extreme
hops
here
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
balance
from
the
malts
still
a
very
likeable
and
highly
drinkable
amber
ale
certainly
a
very
interesting
brew
that
i
look
forward
to
having
again
taste

a
distinct
hop
smell
instantly
hits
you
nose
along
with
sweet
caramel
and
slight
fruit
notes
as
well
as
hints

this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
just
full
of
flavour
and
a
joy
to
drink
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
flavour
is
more
malty
and
caramel
based
than
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
which
as
mentioned
is
quite
hopped

is
certainly
here

a
great

for
a
session

an

brew
from
troegs
thanks
to
beerluvr
for
this
one
very
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
slight
head
that
adds
to
this
beautiful
looking
amber
ale
there
is
a
hoppy
note
to
this
beer
but
it
isnt
overpowering
also
present
is
a
hint
of
fruitiness
this
beer
leaves
you
yearning
for
another
sip
the
hops
are
wellproportioned
and
leave
a
nice
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
i
was
pleased
from
my
first
sample
of
this
beer
this
is
something
i
could
enjoy
any
time
of
the
year
very
wellrounded
amber
ale
in
short
this
troegs
delivery
pours
a
golden

amber
clear
liquid
with
a
nice
white
head
the
lacing
was
thick
and
long
lasting
the
aroma
was
almost
all
hops
with
some
citrus
undercurrents
the
taste
was
an
explosion
of
hops
there
is
a
definite
lemon
taste
in
there
but
it
is
a
hint
that
is
undetectable
after
the
first
beer
this
beer
has
a
thick
viscuous
feel
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
bubbly
feeling
it
is
a
very
easily
consumed
beer
and
begs
for
more
than
one

in

find
it

enjoy
this
beer
is
just
nice
which
is
not
a
death
knell
but
neither
is
it
an
energetic
endorsement
its
gentle
and
balanced
with
no
outstanding
characteristics
but
thats
not
entirely
a
negative
the
mellow
balance
lends
to
a
drinkable
mix
of
traits
the
whole
six
will
be
drunk
and
not
grudgingly
but
neither
will
it
flow
empty
in
one
sitting
if
you
sense
an
ambivalence
youre
perceptive
and
i
think
that
may
stem
from
the
fact
that
the
name
would
lead
you
to
expect
a
heavy
hops
dimension
but
it
by
no
means
delivers
on
that
allusion
this
beer
doesnt
so
much
hop
as
it
skips
the
bitterness
pleasantly
continues
into
the
aftertaste
on
the

some

an
offwhite

which
lasts
aroma
of
sweet

malts
and
citrusy
american
hops
flavor
begins
sweet
and
then
is
well
balanced
by
the
bitterness
caramelcrystal
malt
flavors
and
then
american
hops
bitterness
the
flavor
dries
out
into
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
good
malt
hop
balance
golden
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
not
as
big
as
i
thought
it
should
be
but
it
had
staying
power
leaving
bits
of
spotty
lace
scents
are
green
leafy
and
with
nectorines
and
a
lemon
zest
a
bit
of
butter
rounds
it
out
the
flavor
is
nicely
malted
along
with
those
hops
very
floral
and
zippy
with
citrus
a
bitter
finish
that
seems
to
go
on
and
on
lingering
nicely
on
the
palate
standard
bubbly

and
very
sessionable
drinkability
true
amber
color
very
clear
with
a
nice
head
that
faded
fast
with
a
lingering
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
was
very
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
was
fantastic
nice
and
mellow
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
your
buds
humming
and
excited
i
want
to
say
an
almost
buttery
quality
on
the
tail
end
it
just
flowed
nicely
from
the
hops
in
the
beginning
through
the
caramel
taste
in
the
middle
to
the
smooth
end
the
mouthfeel
was
sweet
but
not
overbearing
very
clean
and
light
the
drinkability
was
unsurpassed
honestly
i
dont
know
one
person
who
couldnt
sit
down
and
drink
a
good
number
of
these
and
still
feel
refreshed
i
will
definitely
have
to
experience
more
from
troegs
very
glad
finally
to
have
tried
this
beer
troegs
is
a
favorite
brewery
always
interesting
and
usually
on
the
good
side
of
quirky
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
comments
excellent
beer
offering
from
chris
and
john
this
brewery
is
evolving
into
something
very
special
pick
up
this
or
any
one
of
their
samplings
soon
pours
a
lovely
clear
copper
color
under
a
small
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
leaves
a
good
scattering
of
lace
dots
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
hoppy
but
not
as
strong
as
many
other
ipas
the
mouth
is
prickly
and
slightly
heavy
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
sour
theres
not
much
malt
here
but
the
hops
are
quite
tame
so
it
isnt
missed
the
hops
are
flowery
with
a
touch
of
grapefruit
and
grass
theres
a
good
bitter
aftertaste
that
makes
you
want
more
this
is
a
good
brew
but
i
prefer
my
ipas
a
little
bit
more
aggressive
pours
a
deep
amber
under
a
huge
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
bold
and
spicy
with
a
floral
character
the
first
sip
is
wellrounded
with
an
upfront
floral
spice
and
a
building
flush
of
sweet
caramel
malt
a
moderate
bitterness
sneaks
out
between
the
balanced
flavors
and
levels
off
at
a
crisp
finish
easy
drinking
and
tasty
drinkability
this
is
purty
good
one
could
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
complaint
might
make
a
nice
session
beer
i
drank
this
beer
while
taking
a
tour
of
the
troegs
brewery
in
harrisburg
pa
i
found
it
so
delicious
i
kept
going
back
to
the
taps
to
refill
my
glass
it
has
a
perfect
amber
color
topped
by
a
substantial
white
head
a
strongly
floral
hop
aroma
wafts
from
the
glass
without
any
prompting
the
flavor
is
slightly
of
toasted
malt
at
first
then
the
hops
make
a
full
frontal
assault
it
is
a
good
clean
bitterness
a
slightly
fruity
note
is
detectable
in
the
background
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
full
for
the
style
i
wish
this
beer
was
more
available
in
my
area
wow
this
beer
should
be
better
known
like
most
good
american
ambers
this
is
yet
another
unique
turn
on
a
widely
varying
style
leaning
to
what
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
might
be
but
undeniably
still
an
amber
yet
another
kick
ass
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
i
have
heard
comparisons
to
hop
devil
i
can
see
it
to
a
point
the
devil
to
me
is
more
bitter
overall
while
the
hopback
is
more
hopflavor
explosive
it
would
be
interesting
to
do
a
head
to
head
comparison
thanks
ba
forum
for
pointing
out
this
as
mega
hoppy
beer
btw
does
this
come
in
bombers
a
great
candidate
for
a
session
brew
easily
consumed
but
a
reminder
is
always
around
the
corner
of
how
good
a
beer
can
taste
well
done
troegs
pours
a
reddish
dark
amber
color
with
a
tall
creamy
light
tan
colored
head
that
slowly
fades
into
a
solid
patch
of
lace
nose
is
sweet
caramel
malts
blended
with
some
floral
and
grassy
hops
medium
in
body
with
a
slightly
buttery
texture
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
perfectly
balanced
by
the
following
bitter
hops
with
notes
of
acidic
citrus
a
dry
bitterness
remains
on
the
tongue
in
a
lasting
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
nice
amber
ale
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
the
sample
appears
amber
with
a
copper
tint
and
a
huge
billowing
head
with
trickled
lace
surrounding
my
pint
this
is
one
balanced
brew
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
is
balanced
between
sweet
caramel
malt
and
floral
eathy
pine
scented
hops
so
balanced
its
just
about
the
perfect
beer
this
is
one
reason
why
troegs
has
done
what
it
has
and
with
its
oatmeal
stout
truly
one
pas
finest
micros
out
there
i
must
say
the
taste
is
also
truly
balanced
with
a
trace
of
the
hops
adding
a
bittering
quality
with
the
malt
waves
following
blending
perfectly
to
form
a
hopback
amber
ale
medium
to
light
bodied
very
good
beer
with
no
off
tones
to
it
everything
here
is
like
butter
what
can
i
say
the
drinkability
level
is
unlike
any
other
amber
ale
out
there
its
perfect
i
love
this
beer
people
have
recommended
troegs
to
me
in
the
past
and
i
can
now
see
why
the
amber
ale
is
a
quality
brew
and
troegs
may
well
be
the
best
kept
beer
secret
of
all
the
pennsylvania
breweries
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
the
bottle
two
troegs
beers
now
for
me
and
two
outstanding
beers
as
i
work
my
way
through
some
east
coast
breweries
this
one
is
starting
to
shine
brighter
than
some
of
the
others
although
i
still
have
some
work
ummmm
tasting
to
do
with
many
more
brands
and
beers
f
pours
a
deep
amber
color
but
is
very
clear
and
initially
has
a
thick
tan
head
theres
no
hunting
for
the
aroma
its
instant
and
intense
hop
flowers
very
herbal
and
very
fresh
american
hops
the
beer
is
certainly
on
sided
but
there
is
a
notable
attempt
to
balance
the
hoppiness
with
a
malt
backbone
finish
is
hoppy
but
not
necessarily
bitter
medium
fullness
and
quite
satisfying
no
question
in
my
mind
that
this
is
an
ipa
and
not
a
bad
one
either
wow
a
really
nice
beersmell
was
greatgrassy
hop
with
some
balancing
caramel
sweetnesspoured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
medium
head
left
a
good
lacing
taste
was
of
herbal
hop
to
begin
with
the
nutty
maltness
came
thru
in
the
end
to
really
balance
this
one
out
nicely
very
well
made
brew
will
be
looking
for
more
from
troegs
after
this
one
however
the
hop
flavor
is
not
dominant
at
all
it
starts
off
with
citrusy
hops
and
a
bitter
middle
then
has
a
bready
malt
finish
i
prefer
their
pale
ale
to
this
im
a
hophead
and
i
cant
help
it
but
this
beer
is
extremely
well
balanced
not
very
complex
but
still
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
would
make
a
great
session
brew
it
says
amber
ale
but
i
say
its
an
ipa
possibly
at
the
level
of
hopdevil
in
my
mind
pours
clear
amber
in
color
with
a
well
retained
head
hops
are
spicy
and
citrusy
and
the
malts
do
well
in
adding
balance
to
this
brew
im
glad
i
live
in
the
philly
area
or
else
i
may
have
never
heard
of
troegs
disappointingly
the
hopback
amber
is
replacing
the
esb
at
troegs
according
to
the
brewers
the
esb
was
one
of
the
finest
american
ales
ive
tasted
and
though
the
hopback
amber
is
a
good
beer
its
certainly
not
on
the
level
of
the
esb
the
hopback
amber
is
much
less
interesting
and
overall
the
just
doesnt
have
the
character
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
esb
a
nice
crisp
brew
with
an
excellent
hop
character
malts
are
light
and
sweet
to
balance
but
the
hops
really
provide
the
flavor
here
the
spiciness
gets
together
with
a
ruby
red
grapefruit
flavor
and
then
dries
leaving
you
with
another
kick
of
spice
a
nice
drinker
any
time
of
the
year
this
is
one
you
can
keep
around
with
you
for
a
while
in
my
review
of
troegs
esb
i
said
it
needed
a
little
something
to
make
it
special
i
understand
that
hopback
is
to
replace
the
esb
and
it
easily
fulfills
my
request
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
a
confused
one
it
is
an
amber
ale
but
also
ventures
into
ipa
and
esb
territory
i
would
say
that
troegs
is
sailing
a
new
flagship
heartily
recommended
hazy
amber
in
color
with
a
thich
persistent
white
head
that
was
quite
easy
on
the
eyes
cleany
hop
aromas
of
citrus
and
spice
come
through
and
eventually
yeild
to
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
largely
hop
dominated
and
a
little
to
hoppy
for
the
style
the
malt
does
come
through
and
make
its
presence
known
in
such
a
way
to
discount
being
able
to
call
this
an
ipa
bitterness
leaves
a
dry
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
wary
of
the
hops
if
you
are
expecting
a
good
amber
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
amber
highlights
a
thick
creamy
head
that
fades
ever
so
slowly
into
a
thin
layer
of
foam
tops
the
rather
clear
body
it
is
easily
roused
by
a
simple
swirl
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
strong
citrus
note
but
it
is
very
clean
the
first
taste
is
all
citrus
hops
but
the
next
taste
reveals
some
buttery
malt
notes
mixed
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
some
brown
sugar
there
is
ample
bittering
on
the
finish
as
well
this
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
traditional
amber
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
very
enjoyable
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
time
to
seek
out
a
case
of
this
one
my
friends
may
get
to
know
the
trogner
brothers
soon
as
this
may
be
a
staple
of
the
summer
beer
supply
pours
out
with
a
cream
colored
head
over
very
clear
amber
liquid
lots
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
nose
cascades
could
they
be
also
some
malt
thrown
in
there
as
well
taste
is
medium
bodied
maltiness
some
fruitiness
both
step
aside
for
a
crashing
wave
of
hop
bitterness
crisp
and
bracing
til
some
malty
sugar
sweetness
reappears
then
both
come
together
in
harmony
to
form
a
nice
balanced
finish
this
beer
was
pretty
straightforward
from
the
name
it
was
easy
to
tell
what
the
major
hop
contributions
would
be
a
nicely
put
together
beer
i
have
a
feeling
that
once
the
weather
stays
consistently
warm
there
will
be
room
for
this
in
my
fridge
the
aroma
is
all
over
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
the
flavor
speaks
of
the
same
with
some
punch
but
not
too
much
hops
a
very
good
brew
to
say
the
least
prost
the
aroma
had
a
heavy
citrus
tang
grapefruits
along
with
some
floral
notes
the
body
was
a
bit
light
taste
was
light
and
refreshing
slightly
citrusy
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
could
easily
make
this
an
everyday
beer
for
me
i
look
foward
to
trying
other
beers
from
this
brewery
medium
amber
with
thick
dens
off
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
citrus
hop
aroma
medium
sweet
maltiness
that
finishes
well
with
a
spicy
floral
hop
bite
but
not
a
huge
hop
bite
bit
heavier
mouthfeel
i
had
to
give
this
a
lower
drinkability
due
to
the
malty
heaviness
thats
not
a
bad
characteristic
but
i
would
have
a
hard
time
with
more
than
two
of
these
this
beer
poured
a
beautifully
clear
amber
color
and
while
held
to
the
light
the
bubbles
danced
elegantly
in
the
glass
the
head
was
fairly
thick
and
a
offwhite
color
that
seemed
to
last
fairly
well
full
and
then
as
a
thin
film
to
the
end
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
fresh
at
first
i
thought
it
was
because
i
was
at
the
brewery
drinking
it
but
then
realized
while
i
talked
to
the
2
troeg
brothers
that
it
was
the
excellent
use
of
fresh
quality
products
i
smelled
fresh
hops
naturegrass
flowers
citrus
and
some
spice
there
was
a
slight
malt
aroma
to
it
but
i
really
over
looked
it
due
to
the
great
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
smooth
and
well
balanced
soft
hops
grass
and
flowers
were
the
prominent
flavors
that
were
present
but
i
noticed
hints
of
sweet
malt
in
the
middle
of
the
mild
hop
flavor
which
took
over
the
rest
of
the
flavors
till
the
end
it
finished
with
some
mild
hop
spices
left
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
throat
but
not
over
powering
this
beer
was
very
smooth
and
very
pleasing
to
the
taste
buds
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
in
the
future
pours
a

small

long

leaves
a
nice
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
slides
down
outstanding
aroma
of
fresh
hops
the
label
description
makes
it
sound
like
this
beer
is
being
constantly
circulated
around
fresh
whole
leaf
hops
as
its
brewed
very
malty
flavor
given
the
heavy
hop
aroma
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
a
very
nice
blend
nice
bitter
aftertaste
and
smooth
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
this
beer
seemed
very
roguelike
just
not
quite
as
hoppy
i
was
at
the
great
american
beer
festival
in
the
poconos
in
november
02
and
was
very
dissappointed
to
hear
that
troegs
was
discontinuing
their
esb
which
i
thought
was
a
great
american
micro
version
of
the
english
classic
they
told
me
that
this
was
to
be
the
replacement
and
this
is
my
first
tasting
not
as
good
as
the
esb
in
my
opinion
but
an
excellent
beer
none
the
less
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
if
theres
one
thing
that
defines
the
troegs
beers
its
drinkability
and
this
one
is
a
real
charmer
it
pours
a
clear
very
deep
amber
body
thats
capped
by
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
head
drops
shortly
to
a
thin
creamy
surface
covering
but
maintains
it
throughout
the
entire
glass
and
leaves
some
spotty
lace
as
well
the
aroma
however
establishes
this
beer
as
something
special
fresh
hops
burst
forth
as
if
you
had
them
cupped
in
your
hands
and
you
could
rub
them
between
your
fingers
releasing
the
floral
softly
grassy
and
lightly
spicy
aromas
really
enticing
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
very
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
thats
lightly
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
melds
a
rich
caramel
maltiness
with
grassy
and
floral
hop
flavors
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
a
gentle
sweetness
comes
forth
and
accentuates
some
of
the
more
floral
flavors
of
the
hops
it
finishes
lightly
dry
with
a
lingering
caramellaced
malt
note
and
a
gently
spicy
hop
character
the
hop
bitterness
is
well
restrained
keeping
it
quite
drinkable
and
accessible
and
allows
for
an
interplay
between
the
flavors
of
the
sweet
malt
and
hops
thats
rarely
seen
although
the
serious
hop
head
may
be
let
down
by
this
beer
because
of
its
moderate
bitterness
i
think
that
most
beer
lovers
will
find
its
ability
to
combine
and
balance
the
malt

nosferatu
has
long
been
one
of
my
favourite
seasonals
many
a
halloween
it
has
sucked
my
wallet
dry
but
so
far
as
im
concerned
this
hearty
combination
of
sweet
malt
and
multifaceted
hops
is
a
gustatory
masterpiece
the
fact
that
its
so
irresistibly
drinkable
even
at
8
alcohol
tells
you
something
about
just
how
much
flavour
it
offers
heres
hoping
this
fall
release
is
eternal
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
little
boozy
but
had
great
smells
of
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
pine
from
the
hops
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
mellow
than
i
thought
it
would
be
considering
the
smell
but
still
very
nice
the
taste
had
toasted
malts
with
some
hops
and
then
a
bit
of
burn
on
the
end
i
liked
it
quite
a
lot
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
ale
i
prefer
the
brewerys
eliot
ness
over
this
ale

a
little
fruit
cake

the
nose
joined
by
minty
hops
spicy

marks
each

with
a
fine
line

a
rich

with
a
hint
of

a
does
of
bread
crust
and
a
well
rounded
drying
bitter
finish
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
o
an
enjoyable
red
probably
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
had
perhaps
with
more
hop
presence
when
fresh
but
nicely
balanced
now
would
buy
more
if
gl
was
available
in
my
state
o
a
autumnal
favorite
and
a
welcome
reprieve
from
the
onslaught
of
pumpkin
beers
a
brew
to
make
count
orlok
proud
o
a
nice
bold
hoppy
red
ale
i
would
love
to
see
them
ditch
the
cascade
in
favor
of
a
british
hop
give
it
some
character
ill
have
to
jump
on
a
bottle
as
soon
as
its
released
next
time
pours
a
very
deep
amber
with
a
small
light
brown
head
dissipates
quickly
a
little
bit
of
light
lacing
around
the
edges
a
little
bit
murky
aroma
is
citrusy
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
tiny
bit
of
pine
reminds
me
of
a
very
subtle
barleywine
minus
the
booziness
not
quite
what
youd
expect
from
a
red
taste
is
a
little
subdued
very
lightly
toasted
malts
with
some
sweet
caramel
a
bit
of
pine
as
it
warms
the
sweet
caramel
comes
through
a
bit
more
and
bitterness
starts
to
linger
on
the
tongue
this
one
is
thin
but
starts
to
get
a
sticky
resinous
as
it
warms
pretty
easy
to
put
down
for
a
8er
overall
one
of
the
more
tasty
red
ales
youll
find
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
available
excellent
brew
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
medium
beige
head
with
light

taste
is
a
strong

with
a
good
dose

on
the

a

with
good

the
finish
is

some

this
brew
goes
down
smooth
considering
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
overall
a
very
good
tasty
brew
is
a
leader
in
its
class
overall
4
although
good
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
one
i
do
feel
gl
produce
some
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
german
beers
however
i
enjoy
just
about
every
beer
put
out
by
these
guys
but
this
is
far
from
my
favorites
from
them

very
tempting
upfront
bitterness
on
the
nose
some
crisp
malty
notes
but
rather
light
aroma
overall
this
might
be
the
weakest
area
of
this
excellent
brew
the
flavor
made
up
for
the
weak
nose
delicious
malt
presence
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
i
would
swear
there
was
bit
of
rye
in
this
and
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
clean
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
my
new
favorite
fall
beer
different
get
some
get
some
now
and
get
some
fresh
this
is
an
excellent
brew
initial
toast
and
strong
caramel
malt
balanced
beautifully
with
a
nice
floral
hop
character
begins
to
open
up
upon
warming
and
takes
on
increased
roastiness
almost
nutty
fall
in
a
glass
to
me
the
lack
of
lacing
is
disappointing
but
the
balance
between
malt
and
hops
makes
this
a
bearable
red
ale
it
starts
off
with
malt
flavor
and
ends
with
hop
bitterness
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
slight
khaki
head
aroma
is
a
thick
caramel
and
toast
with
some
earthiness
and
orange
zest
mixed
in
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
flavor
but
hits
heavier
in
both
the
malts
and
hops
moderate
bitterness
to
this
thing
but
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
keep
the
hops
in
check
a
fuller
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
solid
beer
from
gl
here
glad
i
went
with
the
4
pack
over
just
a
single
though
not
sure
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
tastes
great
in
the
mouth
caramel
malt
a
little
roastiness
and
citrus
and
floral
hops
has
a
lingering
pithy
bitterness
that
isnt
pleasing
to
my
palate
definitely
better
as
it
warms
overall
an
outstanding
beer
excellent
o
i
found
this
one
to
be
really
enjoyable
a
very
nice
hoppy
redamber
alcohol
is
relatively
well
hidden
and
it
drinks
much
easier
than
the
8
abv
that
it
is
this
my
favorite
beer
from
a
brewery
stocked
with
world
class
beers
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
full
bodied
well
carbonated
i
like
this
beer
but
like
many
from
great
lakes
its
not
a
knockout
worth
getting
for
sure
though
cooler
summer
day
in
the
midatlantic
and
this
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
today
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
plenty
of
toasty
grains
and
a
heavy
body
that
typifies
such
a
heavy
beer
alcoholwise
tangy
bitter
touch
at
the
finish
overall
a
surprisingly
solid
beer
for
its
age
and
quite
a
big
brew
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
did
like
this
but
it
reminded
me
of
tomato
juice
andor
blood
still
it
was
clean
sweetly
malty
had
some
breadycakey
notes
dark
cherries
etc
just
had
some
strange
notes
to
it
cant
award
the
a
for
my
own
taste
but
being
put
together
its
respectable
cant
say
i
would
buy
it
again
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
for
an
8
alcohol
beer
o
this
beer
has
a
rich
mouthfeel
and
seems
heavier
and
fuller
in
flavor
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
over
all
a
very
good
balanced

complex
imperial

i
would
recommend
you
try

overallcomments
on
of
my
favorite
glbc
beers
and
for
good
reason
because
nosferatu
is
just
a
tremendously
well
done
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
fall
season
it
has
a
great
flavor
profile
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
do
this
is
a
maltforward
red
ale
that
appears
even
bigger
than
its
8
abv
would
suggest
it
retains
just
enough
american
hops
influence
to
keep
it
from
being
mistaken
for
an
old
ale
this
beer
promises
to
pair
with
food
in
versatile
fashion
all
while
remaining
assertive
in
the
face
of
other
strong
flavors
o
excellent
brew
worthy
of
a
try
great
winter
beer
as
the
8
warms
the
soul
nothing
really
stands
out
to
me
specifically
i
think
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
offering
from
bells
definitely
lives
up
to
their
reputation
of
making
really
good
beers
cheers
low
c
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
red
ales
ive
ever
had
for
me
its
more
complex
and
balanced
that
gknight
and
would
pick
this
every
time
im
glad
i
have
another
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
in
this
one
that
combined
with
the
relatively
light
body
makes
for
one
dangerous
and
easy

this
beer
is
phenomenal
and
a
favorite
of
mine
pours
a
lovely
brick
red
scent
is
unremarkable
but
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
hops
and
malt
the
hops
provide
the
backbone
here
to
the
malt
that
is
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
a
beautiful
wellbalanced
highly
quaffable
beverage
perhaps
the
perfect
fall
beer
a
big
big
imperial
red
heartily
recommended
bloody
good
this
should
be
the
level
to
which
other
halloweenthemed
beers
aspire
to
theres
no
hokey
pumpkin
fetishism
to
be
found
the
flavors
come
from
the
beer
and
not
from
syrup
or
flavorants
added
later
and
its
as
near
to
blood
red
as
one
can
get
warming
from
the
first
swallow
drying
starts
before
that
hops
are
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
others
can
reach
ipa
levels
fortunately
this
one
doesnt
rated
down
a
bit
from
original
review
but
generally
agree
with
point
i
think
id
rate
it
decently
higher
without
that
last
taste
it
had
a
little
more
bitterness
than
an
amber
which
i
liked
and
enjoyed
until
the
end
dark
translucent
amber
color
with
medium
light
cream
colored
head
that
diminishes
after
a
few
minutes
into
just
a
ring
and
messy
lacing
aroma
is
faint
but
has
nice
amber
malts
and
light
fruity
hop
tons
of
flavor
but
not
too
strong
or
overkill
on
anything
its
so
balanced
the
hops
and
malts
work
perfectly
together
theres
no
alcohol
flavor
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
for
an
amber
its
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
this
is
so
good
the
color
is
beautiful
the
biscuity
sweet
smell
is
complemented
with
the
bitter
piney
taste
i
will
get
this
again
this
didnt
feel
like
a
beer
that
was
8
00
abv
and
only
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
could
be
felt
in
the
initial
taste
of
this
its
not
often
that
a
beer
can
be
this
complex
and
incredibly
smooth
at
the
same
time
but
this
fit
the
bill
and
on
its
own
paired
with
spicy
foods
or
as
a
dessert
this
would
be
a
great
choice
it
never
warmed
me
but
it
never
felt
weak
either
and
its
not
often
i
find
an
offering
that
combines
chocolate
and
fruit
flavors
so
well
without
being
dark
and
powerful
well
worth
enjoying
even
though
halloween
has
passed
by
for
the
year
a
good
imperial
though
for
those
into
pine
and
a
really
stiff
bitterness
well
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
as
my
first
great
lakes
beer
mainly
because
nosferatu
is
one
of
my
favorite
characters
from
old
scifi
horror
stuff
the
beer
well
it
was
sub
par
not
bad
but
not
as
mind
blowing
as
i
heard
it
was
as
far
as
having
this
be
my
first
great
lakes
brew
ill
give
them
another
shot
i
hear
the
ipas
and
stouts
are
good
so
ill
shoot
for
those
next
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
either
at
least
its
got
a
bad
ass
label
o
flavorful
and
interesting
well
worth
a
try
o
the
sum
is
more
than
the
total
of
its
parts
always
a
seasonal
favorite
o
compares
well
with
gknight
from
oskar
or
the
best
from
stone
oaked
arrogant
bastard
a
must
try
overall
a
really
good
strong
ale
the
sweetness
brings
you
in
and
the
hop
knock
you
out
great
lakes
always
bring
great
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
o
the
attributes
of
an
imperial
red
are
there
and
remarkable
malts
could
come
off
to
others
as
more
to
be
desired
but
overallstrong
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
solid
hoppy
red
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
and
it
has
some
interesting
scents
o
good
simple
flavor
decent
hop
bitterness
with
a
good
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
toffee
flavor
hints
of
lemon
come
through
at
the
end
flavor
is
a
little
disproportionate
in
my
opinion
aging
for
another
month
or
two
may
improve
the
balance
o
this
is
a
seriously
tasty
beer
i
can
see
why
its
perfect
for
the
fall
months
it
fits
my
seasonal
taste
buds
flawlessly
i
personally
greatly
dislike
red
ales
but
i
somehow
find
myself
trying
a
new
one
every
now
and
then
this
one
puts
all
the
others
to
shame
definitely
a
great
october
beer
great
lakes
has
made
a
terrific
beer
here
i
love
the
rich
malt
character
of
this
the
hop
resin
coats
the
palate
and
brings
out
the
toasty
malt
and
the
sweetness
perfectly
pours
a
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
nice
nose
of
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
noble
hops
an
excellent
ale
that
i
wish
was
available
all
year
very
well
balanced
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
also
slick
well
carbonated
this
is
an
example
of
how
to
properly
hop
a
beer
the
hop
flavor
is
pronounced
but
without
a
harsh
bitterness
against
a
full
caramel
background
the
taste
lingers
of
fresh
hop
resin
increase
the
malt
bill
a
bit
and
this
becomes
a
gold
medal
exceptional
ale
while
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
crisp
from
the
carbonation
leaving
you
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
over
a
noble
hop
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
smoke
great
lakes
nosferatu

overall
absolutely
delicious
this
is
the
best
glbc
beer
i
have
had
so
far
in
front
of
the
lake
erie
monster
and
the
ef
porter
i
have
not
been
lucky
enough
to
try
alchemy
hour
yet
to
me
this
could
be
classified
as
a
red
ipa
the
hopiness
is
very
prominent
the
flavor
as
very
complex
this
has
been
compared
to
stones
arrogant
bastard
to
me
it
is
a
more
refined
version
but
to
the
keen
taster
i
believe
you
will
find
more
complexity
and
flavors
in
this
one
overall
nothing
too
special
but
nice
and
enjoyable
to
have
with
a
meal
o
a
must
try
for
the
fan
of
hoppy
reds
well
done
per
usual
for
glbc
clean
tasting
semicomplex
and
refreshing
brew
you
know
what
screw
pumpkin
beers
this
is
probably
going
to
be
one
of
the
beers
i
look
forward
to
every
fall
its
very
enjoyable
in
that
its
not
difficult
to
appreciate
the
nuances
of
this
beer
tradeoff
of
course
is
that
its
not
über
complex
but
you
know
what
fuck
it
i
want
to
enjoy
my
damn
beer
and
this
one
makes
it
very
easy
to
enjoy
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
its
balanced
with
a
unique
complexity
it
really
represents
what
makes
glbc
such
a
solid
choice
this
beer
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
fell
in
love
with
craft
beer
pours
dark
amber
with
a
thick
slightly
dark
khaki
head
gls
beers
always
look
fantastic
very
earthy
nose
fresh
oranges
grass
dirty
grapefruits
the
nose
fits
the
style
well
the
taste
has
the
same
earthy
tone
lots
of
bitter
hops
at
the
front
of
the
mouth
mid
palate
its
a
bit
sweeter
with
some
sweet
orange
cream
very
floral
finish
with
lots
of
wild
flowers
mouthfeel
is
mild
to
medium
bodied
abv
is
slightly
noticeable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
but
this
is
trying
to
win
me
over
gl
makes
some
incredible
beers
and
as
far
as
style
goes
this
fits
perfectly
the
beer
is
copper
hued
with
an
offwhite
head
ample
lacing
coats
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
a
sufficient
malt
bill
pine
hops
a
healthy
bitterness
exists
throughout
with
a
mild
bready
sweetness
a
tasty
beer
and
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
a
very
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
imperial
red
even
a
hophead
like
me
cant
drink
nugget
nectar
all
the
time
sometimes
you
want
a
beer
that
wants
to
please
your
tongue
instead
of
stab
it
to
death
overall
this
is
absolutely
worth
trying
its
not
great
lakes
best
offering
but
it
tastes
great
and
makes
for
a
good
sipper
or
dessert
beer
overall
glad
i
waited
for
a
fresh
bottle
to
review
the
hop
is
much
more
pronounced
and
it
compensates
for
the
serious
malt
bill
very
tasty
and
certainly
worth
picking
up
i
really
really
like
this
one
a
soft
lovely
smell
belied
by
an
assertive
hoppiness
i
love
how
that
spooky
apparition
bites
i
havent
drank
this
in
6
years
or
so
the
first
time
i
did
i
was
not
all
about
heavy
craft
beers
preferring
to
stick
with
light
american
lagers
and
the
occasional
dortmunder
im
glad
i
came
back
to
visit
this
one
because
it
is
solid
serving
type
bottle
the
feel
is
slightly
astringent
and
a
little
too
bitter
on
the
tongue
its
also
a
wee
bit
thin
but
the
overall
beer
is
quite
good
o
not
my
favorite
beer
but
neither
is
it
my
favorite
style
its
quite
well
made
though
there
are
definitely
others
out
there
who
will
enjoy
it
more
than
i
did
o
nice
offerring
from
great
lakes
recommended
cheers
drinkabilty
i
love
this
beer
loads
of
flavor
lots
of
multiple
flavors
balanced
has
a
great
mix
of
west
coast
ipa
flavors
and
belgium
spices
mixed
with
some
rye
and
great
lakes
unique
twist
of
ingredients
to
create
a
truly
great
beer
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
release
by
them
world
class
and
so
good
to
drink
and
enjoy
for
the
month
of
september
great
lakes
does
well
again
this
is
a
great
beer
really
an
amazing
brew
glad
to
try
the
2
year
vintage
on
tap
o
reminds
me
of
a
tamed
slightly
thin
arrogant
bastard
not
a
huge
fan
of
either
brew
pour
was
amber
red
with
a
nice
cap
of
foam
and
great
lace
smell
was
biscuits
with
a
heap
of
earthy
rye
spice
some
minor
citrus
elements
layered
similarly
the
taste
was
complex
with
layers
earthy
spice
rye
citrus
pith
bitterness
dark
fruit
ensconced
in
a
toasty
biscuit
package
medium
velvety
body
drinks
heavier
than
it
really
is
nice
ale
was
enjoyable
d
this
was
reminiscent
of
flying
mouflan
with
similar
scent
and
taste
which
is
a
good
thing
the
body
was
decent
but
the
finish
was
a
bit
rough
age
may
help
mellow
fresh
was
solid
but
not
quite
mind
blowing
judging
from
the
great
lakes
website
it
seems
like
this
is
somewhere
around
5
months
old
and
it
holds
up
well
it
says
90
day
shelf
life
hopefully
i
can
get
some
fresh
in
september
2013
and
rereview
it
but
i
will
leave
this
up
as
i
consider
it
a
pretty
positive
review
this
beer
brings
it
all
a
nice
hop
profile
even
after
months
big
malts
and
a
good
yeast
influence
balanced
and
an
easy
drinker
for
8
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
perhaps
not
as
fresh
really
kind
of
muddled
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
now
and
im
glad
i
finally
did
wonderful
flavors
all
around
ive
heard
this
one
compared
to
arrogant
bastard
often
is
it
better
tough
call
i
think
ill
give
the
edge
to
ab
because
of
its
abrasive
yet
controlled
hop
profile
and
pronounced
bitterness
while
remaining
so
malty
and
drinkable
but
nosferatu
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
pass
up
if
given
the
chance
to
have
again
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
beers
overall
to
me
this
beer
embodies
fall
nothing
beats
it
on
a
cool
autumn
day
it
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
with
hops
like
some
of
the
newer
imperial
reds
coming
out
pipeworks
blood
of
the
unicorn
and
bells
this
one
goes
to
11
come
to
mind
but
i
prefer
this
beer
to
those
due
to
its
malt
profile
and
impeccable
balance
this
abides
by
german
purity
law
yet
somehow
has
a
slightly
sprucy
flavor
to
it
chinook
hops
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
it
a
worthwhile
pour
tends
to
linger
pleasantly
on
the
palate
so
savoring
it
makes
the
experience
better
gotta
love
the
label
artwork
o
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
red
it
really
comes
down
to
what
you
enjoy
most
and
i
would
have
preferred
this
to
have
more
of
a
tropical
fruitcitrus
hop
presence
kind
of
like
a
lucky
13
or
brian
boru
glad
i
finally
gave
it
a
try
and
have
no
regrets
o
i
look
forward
to
this
strong
warming
beer
every
year
with
its
solid
bitterness
and
decent
hops
flavor
and
aroma
it
never
disappoints
overall
this
was
a
miss
for
me
for
how
much
i
love
great
lakes
lagers
and
darker
beers
i
have
found
their
ipa
lineup
to
be
quite
underwhelming
there
is
too
much
alcohol
brash
hops
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
which
just
doesnt
work
for
me
as
a
big
fan
of
amber
ales
imperial
or
generic
i
cannot
recommend
this
o
sweet
spicy
then
dry
nosferatu
is
a
mellow
gem
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
smoother
and
balanced
despite
the
heavy
hop
presence
a
must
try
and
one
of
those
few
beers
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
single
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
excellent
lacing
on
a
hazy
copper
body
aroma
of
syrup
caramel
malts
resins
but
overall
mild
flavors
are
pretty
tough
to
handle
at
first
very
boozy
and
tartsharp
mosty
mollases
caramel
red
apple
fig
and
tart
grapefruit
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
may
have
been
infected
a
little
too
funky
also
the
booze
were
hard
to
get
used
to
verging
into
barleywine
realm
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
red
ales
that
i
have
had
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
someone
who
likes
a
malt
forward
ipa
this
is
my
favorite
red
ale
o
not
a
bad
beer
has
some
good
qualities
but
overall
not
super
exciting
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
one
again
but
i
probable
wouldnt
seek
it
out
weathered
copper
orange
on
color
with
a
hazy
viscous
appearance
poured
with
a
short
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
reduces
to
a
wispy
cap
that
leaves
random
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
malty
caramel
aroma
is
prominent
with
sweet
candied
apples
citrus
orange
earthy
pine
aromas
and
a
touch
of
booziness
beneath
thick
grainy
feel
that
supresses
the
carbonation
a
bit
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
up
front
with
ripe
apple
sweetness
followed
by
tangy
citrus
hop
flavors
through
the
middle
that
slowly
evolve
into
a
combination
of
resinous
pine
hop
bitterness
and
boozy
heat
at
the
finish
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
smoothness
of
flavoring
and
the
beautifully
creamy
feel
the
flavoring
showed
a
nice
depth
to
the
malts
in
the
way
of
sweetness
while
the
hops
came
in
for
a
nice
balance
they
too
were
sweeter
giving
an
ultimate
impression
of
a
sweeter
beer
all
around
to
the
drinker
the
feel
is
really
what
did
it
for
us
while
the
flavoring
was
all
there
the
mouth
was
so
creamy
and
delicate
with
such
glorious
creaminess
and
frothiness
we
were
left
coming
back
for
more
and
more
overall
there
is
some
really
nice
complexity
and
balance
going
on
here
a
very
interesting
and
flavorful
imperial
red
one
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
try
again
impressive
awesome
hoppy
strong
ale
a
good
imperial
amber
which
indeed
has
a
bite
to
it
o
i
understand
why
this
is
classified
int
he
somewhat
ambiguous
style
of
american
strong
ale
the
flavors
are
very
unique
with
a
combination
of
roasty
hoppy
and
nutty
this
is
a
perfect
fall
brew
in
my
opinion
i
highly
recommend
it
final
thoughts
i
heard
some
good
things
about
this
beer
so
i
went
ahead
and
bought
a
bottle
wish
i
would
have
sooner
a
wellrounded
fullflavored
brew
with
a
lot
of
things
to
like
about
it
would
i
drink
it
again
yep
o
this
one
packs
a
lunch
but
is
well
balanced
the
malts
are
sweet
but
the
hops
provide
just
enough
to
balance
it
our
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
a
good
selection
for
a
cold
night
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
my
only
complaint
is
also
my
greatest
compliment
this
beer
is
very
simple
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
malt
it
is
deliciously
simple
and
that
is
probably
its
only
fault
o
not
an
overwhelmingly
amazing
beer
but
solid
on
all
fronts
and
featuring
the
signature
great
lakes
maltiness
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
tastes
in
any
beer
worth
picking
up
as
advertised
this
beer
has
tons
of
character
and
is
great
for
a
cool
autumn
night
overall
pretty
good
offering
not
a
standout
but
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
o
ive
had
this
beer
very
fresh
and
2
moths
past
the
best
buy
date
the
hops
completely
fade
making
this
an
entirely
different
style
of
beer
from
an
imperial
ale
fresh
it
is
very
hoppy
but
aged
it
is
a
strongold
ale
type
beer
i
adore
this
beer
when
it
is
fresh
and
look
forward
to
drinking
it
every
fall
it
is
so
delicious
o
a
solid
strong
ale
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
dark
fruit
and
malt
and
slightly
less
hops
but
still
really
good
but
this
was
a
visual
treat
fix
the
finish
and
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
o
this
is
a
great
beer
its
like
a
middle
of
the
country
take
on
arrogant
bastard
i
may
age
one
or
2
to
see
what
happens
but
its
great
fresh
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
on
top
quickly
dwindling
to
a
bubbly
covering
heavy
oily
hop
aroma
sweet
citrus
dark
fruit
spice
bread
leafiness
and
pine
smooth
piney
simcoe
grapefruit
light
pepperiness
caramel
biscuit
and
a
little
brown
sugar
a
tasty
blend
of
flavors
creates
a
lovely
balance
medium
body
not
too
heavy
on
the
tongue
creamy
solid
bitterness
very
nice
o
a
damn
fine
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
great
lakes
really
glad
they
make
this
every
year
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
from
great
lakes
the
malt
and
hops
compliment
each
other
perfectly
and
the
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
8
a
really
great
beer
for
fall
overall
this
is
a
well
rounded
solid
option
from
great
lakes
have
yet
to
be
dissipointed
in
their
beers
o
great
name
and
great
artwork
oh
yeah
and
a
great
beer
as
well
very
impressive
balance
and
the
fruit
and
cherry
on
top
of
this
make
this
a
fall
favorite
for
me
overall
this
is
one
tasty
imperial
ipa
a
great
blend
of
hop
malt
and
sweet
with
fantastic
flavor
transitions
and
an
excellent
feel
the
appearance
nose
and
mouthfeel
are
almost
spot
on
the
flavor
is
complex
but
confusing
its
very
malty
but
overly
toasty
and
roasty
its
hopyy
but
the
hops
cant
contend
with
the
malts
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again

fairly
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
strong
ale
great
hop
flavor
complexity
and
malt
balance
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
very
enjoyable
stuff
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
red
amber
in
color
with
maybe
a
one
finger
head
and
little
lacing
this
beer
is
very
malt
forward
which
is
about
the
only
thing
i
pick
up
in
the
smell
and
it
dominates
in
the
taste
very
well
balanced
in
flavor
and
besides
the
malt
i
get
the
hops
some
toffee
and
sweet
tart
fruitiness
it
comes
off
very
smooth
at
first
but
has
a
bitter
dry
aftertaste
that
is
nonoffensive
my
overall
opinion
is
that
it
is
a
really
good
beer
but
it
lacks
distinctiveness
and
for
a
seasonal
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
more
bold
all
around
because
of
this
i
cant
say
it
justifies
the
higher
price
of
it
which
was
close
to
12
for
a
4pk
if
this
was
on
their
main
line
of
beers
i
would
probably
rate
it
higher
but
in
the
scope
of
things
its
just
another
quality
product
from
glbc
that
i
recommend
for
at
least
a
try
overall
this
is
a
prime
example
of
why
you
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
that
has
an
unbalanced
pine
hop
presence
it
was
a
drain
pour
x2
for
me
but
im
not
into
beers
being
over
hopped
especially
with
piney
or
floral
hops
overall
another
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
slightly
preferred
the
2012
version
but
the
2013
is
no
slouch
good
imperial
red
here
great
lakes
never
disappoints
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
time
of
year
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
it
will
sneak
up
and
bite
you
for
real
o
im
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
brew
that
always
comes
around
this
time
a
year
but
id
never
taken
the
plunge
great
idea
for
a
halloween
seasonal
as
well
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
such
a
delicious
red
ale
i
really
have
enjoyed
this
four
pack
shared
one
with
a
friend
of
mine
on
the
golf
course
and
he
was
really
impressed
i
recommend
it
thank
god
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
i
get
a
burnt
sugar
flavor
molasses
caramel
candy
and
a
nice
floral
hop
note
in
the
background
it
has
a
lighter
body
which
shocked
me
especially
for
an
8
abv
beer
with
medium
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
a
touch
on
the
dry
side
its
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
their
best
seasonals
appropriately
on
the
sweeter
side
for
a
halloween
seasonal
i
suppose
although
i
couldnt
see
myself
consuming
more
than
one
bottle
per
session
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
much
less
the
relatively
high
abv
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
while
this
brew
and
i
get
along
much
better
than
we
did
in
the
past
few
years
it
is
still
far
from
my
favorite
strong
ale
still
it
is
chockfull
of
roasty
fruits
and
does
a
bit
of
damage
to
the
palate
medium
to
heavybodied
i
will
try
another
one
of
these
fresh
when
the
new
season
rolls
around
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
smell
of
big
caramel
malt
juicy
citrus
hops
and
hints
of
sweet
ripe
fruits
the
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
as
well
caramel
malt
and
wood
notes
as
well
as
some
piney
hops
in
the
finish
the
hop
bitterness
really
shows
up
in
the
aftertaste
and
stays
awhile
in
the
mouth
good
beer
that
i
dont
buy
often
enough
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
red
ales
achieves
a
great
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
unique
and
tasty
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
until
the
finish
tasty
toasted
malts
with
some
caramel
paired
with
citrus
hops
share
the
stage
finishing
hops
of
bitter
dried
herbs
and
a
touch
of
pine
spoil
the
party
at
the
end
i
poured
this
one
into
a
glass
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
body
with
and
great
looking
2
white
head
that
hangs
around
the
smell
is
has
nice
ctrus
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
nice
grapfruithop
taste
up
front
with
a
malt
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfell
is
very
nice
and
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
tastemouthfeel
full
and
hearty
in
the
front
having
a
crisp
burst
of
hops
that
warms
from
the
alcohol
on
the
back
end
as
it
goes
down
finishing
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
hop
taste
that
almost
seems
like
it
has
a
bit
of
rye
in
the
mix
the
abv
is
warming
and
not
boozy
in
the
least
overall
another
solid
offering
from
great
lakes
well
done
would
certainly
recommend
and
get
again
in
future
seasons
to
come
this
is
a
good
sipper
nothing
too
complex
or
crazy
but
a
nice
winter
warmer
style
good
on
these
cold
rainy
days
onot
bad
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
get
it
around
here
pretty
good
brew
and
solid
as
always
from
great
lakes
i
wish
the
hop
profile
were
a
little
more
complex
but
really
only
nitpick
complaints
this
tides
me
over
until
nn
hits
nice
red
colour
with
good
carbonation
aroma
of
malt
and
citrusy
earthy
hops
though
not
a
strong
nose
taste
of
caramel
citrus
fruit
and
raisins
rather
sweet
but
balanced
by
the
distinct
alcohol
bite
and
hop
bitterness
overall
a
delicious
beer
if
a
bit
heavy
a
four
pack
would
make
for
a
very
nice
liquid
dinner
ogood
ill
have
to
try
a
fresher
one
to
see
how
it
compares
overall
a
very
solid
beer
the
hops
are
fairly
dominant
over
the
malt
in
the
flavor
perhaps
more
so
than
the
aroma
indicates
definitely
worth
a
try
though
a
bit
misleading
to
label
it
a
red
ale
imperial
or
not
overall
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
hop
bitterness
with
this
one
i
see
that
my
bottle
was
best
before
nov
2011
so
maybe
that
had
something
to
do
with
it
anyways
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
just
not
something
id
reach
for
again
o
not
doing
much
for
me
for
an
american
strong
ale
i
was
expecting
more
very
different
from
other
strong
ales
ive
had
but
the
style
is
not
particular
overall
quite
good
would
willingly
pick
up
another
fourpack
if
i
could
find
it
also
my
year
of
aging
this
shows
that
it
ages
well
in
a
fridge
o
this
is
a
good
great
lakes
beer
glad
i
found
this
one
at
zipps
in
minneapolis
o
i
liked
it
a
very
well
balanced
american
strong
ale
glad
i
was
able
to
find
a
4pack
of
this
thanks
bpfrush
for
the
killer
extra
youre
the
man
brian
o
not
bad
stuff
here
this
one
had
some
age
on
it
so
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
and
taste
some
big
hops
pretty
good
stuff
oa
nice
red
ale
with
a
nice
biting
bitter
finish
d
definitely
a
good
tasting
brew
not
quite
an
american
strong
but
definitely
more
what
the
label
says
an
imperial
red
good
balance
makes
this
a
tasty
drinkable
brew
for
sure
an
imperial
red
ale
pours
more
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
smells
a
little
sweet
like
a
red
with
a
round
hop
profile
as
well
a
little
funky
in
the
sense
that
the
alcohol
in
cohorts
with
the
malts
is
off
a
little
to
me
new
maybe
not
gross
taste
quite
large
malt
driven
for
sure
but
more
balanced
than
the
smell
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
pint
of
this
as
it
was
filling
and
strong
heavy
mouthfeel
and
intoxicating
my
first
big
beer
from
great
lakes
not
wowed
overall
id
like
to
try
this
beer
fresh
but
its
definitely
a
worthy
beer
as
is
if
youre
a
fan
consider
putting
some
away
and
having
it
some
cold
winters
night
4pk
of
these
at
12
years
old
is
like
having
a
4pk
of
decently
aged
old
ruffian
or
olde
gnarlywine
o
another
great
offering
from
gl
not
as
hop
dominated
as
i
feared
which
for
me
is
a
good
thing
i
do
think
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
has
a
good
range
of
flavors
and
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavor
makes
it
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tried
lately
notes
a
big
feature
to
this
robust
beer
is
its
lingering
qualities
which
leads
me
to
suggest
great
lakes
should
continue
to
release
this
in
the
fall
but
push
it
through
the
winter
season
due
to
its
warming
effect
tasty
ale
and
not
as
strong
flavored
as
expected
this
isnt
a
hop
bomb
this
is
a
rather
friendly
strong
ale
i
will
have
again
overall
a
little
aggressive
on
the
hoppy
flavors
something
i
always
personally
enjoy
but
an
overall
delicious
brew

entirely
hidden
this
is
not
one
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
whole
lot
of
in
one
sitting
o
a
tasty
and
unique
flavor
worth
seeking
out
its
a
well
made
beer
and
i
liked
it
but
not
as
much
as
most
of
the
other
reviewers
definitely
a
beer
for
the
hopheads
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
i
dont
know
whether
to
call
this
an
imperial
red
or
a
strong
ale
or
what
but
its
pretty
tasty
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
bottled
beer
great
lakes
offers
o
although
leaning
towards
the
bitter
hoppy
side
this
beer
still
remains
incredibly
balanced
very
easy
drinking
for
8
big
biscuity
malts
and
sugar
with
pine
and
citrus
hops
to
balance
it
out
o
i
love
the
beer
but
think
that
it
could
be
improved
probably
without
a
ton
of
effort
i
have
to
assume
that
this
beer
was
meant
to
taste
this
way
but
the
bitterness
is
just
off
in
this
beer
it
is
a
clean
beer
until
it
was
overbittered
take
away
the
astringency
and
the
pungent
bitterness
and
this
is
a
great
beer
for
an
8
beer
this
does
seem
to
do
decently
on
the
strong
ale
side
which
was
slightly
surprising
o
a
good
red
ale
a
touch
to
floraly
and
the
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
are
the
only
bad
points
pours
a
very
nice
red
color
with
a
short
head
dissipates
to
a
film
and
lacing
the
smell
is
fruity
hop
with
a
sweet
malty
background
the
taste
is
also
fruity
hop
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
mildly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
nosferatu
is
a
unique
beer
i
havent
encountered
a
beer
that
so
demonstrably
integrates
both
malt
and
hop
flavor
its
a
beer
in
conflict
an
ipa
blended
up
with
a
scotch
aleoctoberfest
hybrid
and
its
delicious
it
leans
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
and
im
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
but
there
wont
be
another
fall
where
i
dont
think
of
this
beer
perfectly
matched
to
the
season
in
which
it
is
released
nosferatu
is
an
outstanding
strong
ale
ogood
beer
i
dont
have
alot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
i
did
enjoy
it
nice
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
would
have
again
o
this
is
a
real
winner
of
a
beer
i
am
a
huge
imperial
ipa
fan
but
this
was
a
really
nice
change
of
pace
that
will
soon
be
repeated
by
buying
these
bad
boys
again
overall
4
5
incredibly
drinkable
itd
probably
be
more
bitter
if
it
was
fresher
but
honestly
where
it
is
now
is
fantastic
i
liked
the
wide
variation
of
hop
flavors
present
especially
with
more
prominent
grass
floral
and
tropical
notes
happening
this
really
was
a
hop
story
for
me
honestly
which
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
or
remembered
from
last
year
malt
was
simple
but
did
the
job
more
than
well
enough
this
was
a
great
beer
looking
forward
to
next
years
already
overall
a
full
flavored
malty
beer
that
has
a
nice
strong
bitterness
slow
sipping
beer
but
fully
satisfying
one
could
have
this
as
a
dessert
beer
deep
ruby
red
with
a
small
amount
of
creamy
head
thins
out
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
nose
is
a
big
on
biscuit
and
rye
bread
also
a
layer
of
peppery
yeast
and
earthy
resinous
hops
the
hops
shine
through
immediately
similar
to
the
nose
not
overwhelming
but
balanced
out
with
the
wave
of
rich
caramel
biscuit
malts
come
through
some
of
the
yeast
character
comes
out
for
the
finish
but
i
am
mainly
tasting
rich
toasty
bready
malts
and
piney
bitter
hops
dry
finish
makes
me
want
to
keep
quenching
my
thirst
o
a
handsome
looking
beer
with
a
brilliant
copper
color
and
a
tall
foamy
cap
the
head
is
dense
and
lingers
a
long
while
leaving
spotty
lacing
in
its
wake
on
the
nose
i
get
a
hoppy
upfont
bouquet
with
piney
and
earth
tones
followed
by
a
malt
nose
of
sweet
caramel
malts
a
little
fruity
too
palette
is
as
the
nose
a
good
dose
of
hops
upfont
similar
to
the
nose
and
equal
amounts
of
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
fruits
in
the
finish
a
well
balanced
ale
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
a
good
beer
be
it
a
red
or
old
one
that
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
again
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
aromas
are
pretty
traditional
for
an
imperial
amber
you
get
a
lot
of
malts
light
cherry
more
malt
maybe
some
oak
its
solid
the
flavors
too
of
a
complex
malt
bill
its
just
hard
to
pick
apart
its
sweetness
which
is
smooth
and
not
over
the
top
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
has
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
its
deceiving
really
you
dont
get
anywhere
near

overall

this
is
a
seasonal
that
is
a
must
get
every
year
a
must
try
o
im
a
big
fan
of
hopped
up
imperial
reds
and
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
nosferatu
is
a
solid
beer
that
ill
likely
pick
up
again
at
some
point
down
the
road
o
too
malty
needs
more
hops
more
like
a
light
barleywine
then
a
hoppy
red
ale
o
really
liked
this
one
i
feel
like
they
could
have
gotten
away
with
9
and
still
done
well
but
still
really
enjoyed
i
love
strong
ales
and
the
red
color
adds
to
the
overall
theme
here
i
highly
recommend
skål
o
good
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
wasnt
sure
what
this
was
classified
as
before
i
saw
it
here
sort
of
a
barleywine
lite
o
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
which
could
put
you
in
a
world
of
hurt
if
your
not
careful
pours
a
rusty
copper
color
good
cap
of
dense
offwhite
to
khaki
froth
good
sticky
lacing
scent
is
hop
forward
with
a
backbone
of
carmamel
toasty
and
nutty
malts
suprising
that
the
taste
leads
with
an
almost
scotch
ale
like
malt
profile
toasty
nutty
and
caramely
before
becoming
a
carrier
of
a
significant
amount
of
american
hops
grassy
piney
and
citrusy
medium
bodied
bright
carbonation
could
use
a
touch
more
heft
a
solid
all
around
showcase
of
solid
malting
and
hopping
od
nice
a
really
drinkable
beer
with
a
huge
hop
dose
bottle
says
imperial
red
though
i
get
no
sense
of
any
elements
typical
of
an
amberred
ale
it
could
use
more
depth
and
balance
but
still
an
alright
beer
wow
another
winner
from
great
lakes
a
very
nice
treat
during
a
cool
night
overall
im
fairly
disappointed
with
this
one
had
higher
hopes
to
me
it
tastes
like
its
old
to
the
point
of
the
buttering
hops
are
left
and
the
aromatics
are
gone
but
thats
not
the
case
i
cant
get
past
how
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
at
points
here
and
there
it
almost
felt
like
i
was
drinking
cough
syrup
or
something
there
is
nice
stuff
in
this
drink
not
sure
why
its
a
4
pack
for
the
price
of
a
6
pack
doesnt
seem
that
big
or
unique
i
nick
it
some
for
that
overall
its
nice
good
malts
decent
hops
booze
is
almost
there
but
drinks
well
a
nice
blood
thickness
and
almost
chewy
balanced
and
drinkable
o
the
label
says
that
this
beer
has
a
bite
and
thats
why
its
named
after
a
vampire
id
have
to
agree
that
it
does
feature
quite
a
bitterness
bite
to
it
not
a
favorite
of
mine
however
overall
this
beer
was
certainly
enjoyable
yet
the
price
is
something
to
be
considered
being
a
little
steep
for
the
end
result
no
regrets
trying
this
beer
it
was
a
good
experience
it
just
isnt
something
that
i
would
seek
out
or
wait
for
each
fall
o
overall
a
good
beer
tasty
and
smooth
without
being
boozy
or
overwhelming
the
palate
great
crafted
strong
ale
gives
arrogant
a
run
for
its
money
i
love
it
o
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
some
time
now
and
i
havent
worked
up
the
balls
to
buy
it
this
bottle
was
given
to
me
and
ive
happy
i
didnt
buy
it
its
not
that
its
a
waste
of
money
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
much
better
beers
for
less
price
worth
trying
but
not
my
favorite
had
on
tap
in
imperial
half
pint
glass
at
hopleaf
in
chicago
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
and
thought
it
would
be
right
up
my
alley
was
not
disappointed

that
held
onto
the
sides
of
the
glass
nicely
nice
sharp
citrus
hops
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
then
the
sugars
followed
by
a
bite
of
pine
great
smooth
drinking
with
balance
of
sweet
sour
spice
that
i
loved
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
a
unique
taste
for
the
style
i
just
wish
it
was
in
a
six
pack
overall
this
is
about
what
i
expected
from
an
imperial
red
ale
everything
you
love
about
a
red
just
more
of
it
a
nice
fall
beer
a
solid
beer
in
a
style
that
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
great
irish
red
ale
type
finish
thats
on
the
hoppy
side
a
little
dry
great
balance
throughout
not
too
hoppy
to
taste
the
rest
of
the
flavors
but
hoppy
enough
for
a

and
caramel
some
alcohol
also
on
the
nose
taste
is
full
of
malts
with
hints
of
hop
and
citrus
fruits
pretty
good
tasting
medium
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
very
good
tasting
beer
and
a
nice
fall
alternative
to
all
the
oktoberfest
and
other
fall
seasonals
o
a
real
nice
beer
reminds
me
of
stone
arrogant
bastard
in
a
lot
of
ways
o
an
outstanding
beer
i
honestly
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
although
great
lakes
usually
doesnt
disappoint
a
powerful
beer
with
big
flavor
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
release
i
look
forward
to
every
fall
and
it
never
disappoints
well
done
great
lakes
a
tad
syrupy
up
front
and
finishing
much
lighter
with
ample
carbonation
overall
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
aforementioned
hop
driven
beers
from
this
brewery
o
my
favorite
seasonal
offering
from
great
lakes
and
may
be
my
favorite
overall
from
them
very
drinkable
with
the
8
being
hidden
very
well
this
came
highly
recommended
but
it
doesnt
wow
me
call
it
a
strong
ale
an
amberred
whatever
you
want
ive
had
quite
a
few
that
i
liked
more
o
this
is
one
hoppy
red
ale
this
is
a
great
hop
head
beer
for
the
fall
months
definitely
a
beer
i
will
pick
up
every
year
overall
an
incredible
red
ale
from
great
lakes
very
bold
with
the
hops
and
malts
great
balance
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
o
great
red
ale
good
balance
on
flavor
and
very
smooth
good
brewery
out
in
cleveland
overall
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
in
this
beer
there
was
a
strong
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
wasnt
totally
pleasant
im
not
sure
that
ill
have
this
one
aga
notes
this
is
great
lakes
burning
river
pale
ale
on
steroids
sort
of
an
american
ipa
with
toasted
malts
instead
of
pale
malts
this
is
a
robust
caramel
and
bittersweet
cocoa
beer
with
zesty
peppery
citrus
hops
a
great
autumn
sipper
o
a
great
beer
that
is
very
well
enjoyed
during
the
cold
months
second
only
to
lake
erie
monster
in
terms
of
gl
beers
get
at
least
a
4
pack
and
when
thats
gone
find
more
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
for
some
reason
i
was
pretty
sure
that
this
beer
was
going
to
be
heavy
on
the
spices
and
possibly
a
pumpkin
beer
but
instead
i
was
given
a
pretty
hoppy
and
biscuity
imperial
red
ale
this
was
unexpected
but
i
ended
up
liking
it
so
it
was
a
good
surprise
the
high
amount
of
bitterness
doesnt
make
it
that
drinkable
so
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
then
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
i
havent
had
the
combo
of
biscuit
malts
and
floral
hops
before
and
i
thought
it
was
different
and
went
well
together
there
wasnt
anything
that
i
didnt
like
but
i
thought
that
the
bitterness
could
be
toned
down
a
little
to
enhance
the
drinkability
and
enjoyment
i
might
get
a
bottle
of
this
when
it
is
released
next
year
but
a
four
pack
may
be
too
much
for
me
to
handle
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
its
pretty
unique
and
if
hops
are
your
thing
i
am
sure
you
will
dig
it
this
looks
like
another
good
beer
from
great
lakes
brewing
company
not
the
most
mind
blowing
beer
but
all
in
all
a
good
change
of
pace
after
having
this
beer
more
than
a
few
times
i
had
to
bump
it
up
to
a
solid
4
all
aspects
are
equally
good
and
it
stands
out
as
a
nice
fall
seasonal
i
buy
a
four
pack
every
year
o
solid
beer
dont
know
what
i
paid
for
it
but
it
was
good
not
really
my
favorite
ever
but
decent
overall
im
pretty
happy
i
got
a
pint
of
this
bold
beer
but
could
definitely
be
bolder
great
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
was
spot
on
worth
getting
for
sure
mouthfeel
it
has
a
smooth
easy
drinking
texture
to
it
that
still
lets
the
flavor
last
future
outlook
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
but
its
another
rock
solid
offering
from
gls
im
sure
well
meet
again
someday
4

a
solid
seasonal
with
good
flavor
well
balanced
i
would
pick
this
up
again
considering
its
not
overally
expensive
at
9
99
at
4
pk
this
is
a
favorite
that
has
eluded
me
for
years
so
happy
to
find
this
overall
a
solid
beer
reds
often
leave
me
disappointed
but
this
brought
the
right
amount
of
balance
to
the
beer
and
left
me
wanting
more
there
was
nothing
that
particularly
stood
out
to
me
but
i
think
gl
has
brewed
another
solid
brew
o
great
lakes
nosferatu
is
a
pretty
good
beer
from
a
top
notch
brewery
all
of
their
higher
gravity
offerings
sans
stouts
tend
to
be
a
little
too
hot
see
lake
erie
monster
with
a
bit
more
finesse
this
could
really
be
something
special
as
it
currently
stands
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
the
rest
of
my
fourpack
and
have
no
problem
recommending
it
to
you
o
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
loads
of
different
flavors
and
smells
a
unique
flavored
brew
and
is
a
good
change
of
pace
on
this
cool
night
in
front
of
the
camp
fire
i
will
buy
a
few
more
of
these
without
question
good
quality
and
class
as
always
from
glbc
at
7
49
a
growler
at
deps
im
glad
they
have
another
keg
on
the
way
when
this
one
runs
out
a
great
beer
for
when
the
nights
turn
colder
overall
nosferatu
is
awesome
it
has
a
very
smooth
hop
flavor
with
a
lot
of
bright
characters
balanced
all
the
way
through
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
had
been
anticipating
for
a
while
and
now
i
feel
a
little
bit
let
down
compared
to
the
bottle
from
2011
the
2010
bottle
is
significantly
different
nearly
no
hop
presence
with
a
cloudy
color
and
an
increased
sweetness
this
bottle
did
not
blow
me
away
either
however
overall
a
very
good
beer
one
ill
buy
each
year
as
a
nice
seasonal
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
good
carbonation
levels
finish
is
sticky
with
a
nice
film
left
on
the
inside
of
your
mouth
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
that
isnt
extremely
bitter
but
still
offers
the
good
citrus
flavors
that
more
bitter
brews
have
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
a
very
light
malty
flavor
quickly
overcome
by
a
dry
hop
bite
predominant
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
overpower
the
contributions
from
toasted
malt
but
there
is
a
noticeably
marmaladelike
sweetness
sort
of
lingering
underneath
all
that
bitterness
i
thought
this
beer
was
tasty
and
refreshing
but
personally
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
maltiness
i
enjoyed
it
and
can
suggest
it
without
hesitation
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
at
this
price
o
another
seasonal
ive
been
waiting
on
this
is
a
slight
step
out
from
glbcs
uber
traditional
lineup
and
i
really
dig
it
a
nice
inyourface
malt
bill
and
some
heavy
hopping
make
this
a
nice
tasty
beer
check
this
stuff
out
overy
solid
brew
would
love
to
see
wwhat
some
age
does
to
it
seeing
as
how
this
beer
is
called
nosferatu
i
expected
it
to
be
one
of
two
colors
dark
as
night
or
blood
red
it
was
neither
rather
it
was
amber
despite
the
color
being
not
what
i
expected
this
beer
certainly
has
bite
they
call
it
an
imperial
red
ale
but
it
tastes
and
feels
much
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
it
has
all
the
familiar
characteristics
like
the
dry
finish
the
huge
hoppy
almost
piney
flavor
its
quite
good
o
one
of
my
favorites
this
time
of
year
a
really
solid
red
ale
that
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
on
the
weekend
this
is
a
nicely
done
red
ale
the
color
of
this
brew
fits
the
name
very
really
its
got
a
deep
shade
of
red
with
a
decent
looking
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
piney
citrus
aroma
much
like
some
nice
ipas
do
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
with
some
sweet
caramel
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
i
though
not
overly
carbonated
and
had
a
normal
feeling
body
to
it
overall
i
loved
the
name
of
the
beer
and
in
general
i
though
the
beer
itself
was
quite
good
was
most
surprised
with
how
sweet
this
was
for
a
strong
ale
overall
another
good
beer
from
gl
it
feels
a
bit
watery
too
maybe
a
bit
too
much
for
my
taste
and
for
the
alcohol
by
volume
overall
nosferatu
from
great
lakes
is
a
solid
brew
with
an
excellent
name
and
label
but
probably
not
something
id
return
to
both
because
of
style
and
the
beer
itself
o
the
bottle
says
it
has
a
bite
and
it
does
enjoyed
this
one
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
somewhat
thick
feeling
beer
the
carbonation
helps
to
prevent
this
beer
from
becoming
too
sticky
but
is
not
enough
to
give
it
great
drinkability
in
all
truth
it
is
a
little
more
than
sippable
but
not
much
more
than
that
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
sweet
and
hoppy
sipper
glad
i
got
to
try
it
what
is
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
the
mondays
nosferatu
will
certainly
scare
away
your
blues
this
beer
is
a
amberred
clear
color
with
very
thin
white
head
the
smell
has
hop
and
malt
characters
which
transcends
into
a
wonderful
tasting
ale
i
am
really
starting
to
like
hopped
up
red
ales
and
lagers
the
hop
and
malt
help
to
balance
the
higher
abv
of
this
beer
i
would
be
in
serious
i
mean
serious
trouble
if
i
had
alot
of
this
in
my
fridge
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
sample
if
not
a
session
poured
into
a
tulip
with
a
ruddy
brown
body
color
like
rust
with
a
sizeable
frothy
white
head
smelled
very
hoppy
mostly
floralpiney
hops
sweet
biscuity
and
fruity
smells
almost
like
a
hoppy
rum
cake
sounds
weird
but
its
good
im
not
doing
it
justice
taste
reminds
me
of
an
american
barleywine
sweet
but
not
cloying
or
dry
with
an
assertive
but
not
overwhelming
hop
profile
sticky
oily
hops
mixed
with
a
raisin
and
caramel
background
not
boozy
though
not
surprisingly
and
somewhat
spicy
feels
lighter
than
a
barleywine
though
still
somewhat
viscous
not
that
highly
carbonated
but
not
flat
i
liked
this
brew
a
good
deal
so
much
so
that
my
notes
werent
taken
as
well
this
time
because
i
was
too
busy
just
enjoying
the
beer
definitely
a
good
thing
i
will
be
sure
to
be
iso
this
come
next
fall
big
thanks
goes
out
to
sproser
secret
santa
10
and
crashdavisinoh
for
sending
these
to
me
so
i
could
have
multiple
bottles
enjoy
by
123010
batch
7243ae
served
from
bottle
into
a
delirium
tremens
snifter
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
subtle
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
caramel
hops
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
pretty
good
if
im
honest
the
flavor
however
was
decent
at
best
really
wish
some
of
the
sweet
alcohol
from
the
aroma
would
have
carried
over
into
the
flavor
however
the
sweetness
aspect
was
pretty
big
on
the
flavor
though
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
very
tasty
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
would
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
not
a
bad
brew
though
the
style
imperial
red
ale
isnt
one
im
much
of
a
fan
of
still
its
well
balanced
full
of
flavor
and
has
a
cool
name
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
maybe
next
year
or
aged
for
a
while
longer
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
sizable
tan
head
that
fade
slowly
and
leaves
lacing
all
over
the
place
smells
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
of
an
aggressively
hoppy
imperial
red
ale
hop
forward
with
a
finishing
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
good
appropriately
carbed
and
mediumheavy
thickness
pretty
big
in
all
ways
not
super
drinkable
pretty
decent
and
interesting
brew
d
drinkable
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
early
bittering
hops
but
overall
a
decent
old
stock
needs
a
hint
more
residual
sugar
imo
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
bodied
yet
both
creamy
and
crisp
named
after
one
of
the
scariest
vampires
of
all
time
deep
reddish
amber
color
comes
off
very
clear
and
the
lacing
does
a
great
job
of
sticking
to
the
glass
massive
toasted
biscuity
nose
with
some
sweetness
and
some
hop
resin
smooth
malty
body
big
kiss
of
sweetness
to
start
but
then
the
malt
rails
in
hard
with
a
pleasing
toasted
graini
ness
which
stays
some
rounded
dark
caramel
adds
to
the
sweetness
as
does
the
dark
fruity
alcohol
hops
may
not
beat
this
beer
down
with
bitterness
but
the
oily
resin
flavor
keeps
things
in
check
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
it
unfolds
into
a
lovely
sipper
its
easily
a
mood
beer
for
the
cooler
months
wow
the
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
and
creamy
unexpected
but
couldnt
be
better
crazy
drinkable
for
a
high
alchohol
beer
once
again
i
continue
to
be
very
impressed
with
every
new
great
lakes
beer
i
try
red
wine
in
color
with
a
cream
orange
colored
head
that
has
excellent
texture
and
retention
dare
i
say
that
this
beer
looks
sexy
smells
like
a
caramelized
christmas
tree
caramel
is
also
present
in
the
flavor
with
citrus
and
evergreen
hops
this
beer
packs
a
strong
punch
with
out
being
overwhelming
good
full
mouthfeel
and
i
cant
tell
that
its
8
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
the
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
is
awesome
as
each
sip
is
swallowed
great
all
around
beer
poured
into
dimple
glass
from
12oz
bottle
pours
an
excellent
deep
blood
red
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
sweet
with
caramel
earth
citrus
and
pine
wellbalanced
and
tasty
on
the
flavor
with
caramel
malt
nuts
roast
wood
spices
and
citruspine
hops
like
a
good
imperial
red
ale
if
anything
mediumbodied
and
smooth
yet
sticky
on
the
palate
with
some
hop
resins
put
the
last
nail
in
my
coffin
on
halloween
very
good
stuff
i
am
a
big
fan
of
ipadipa
and
this
fits
the
bill
although
list
as
a
asa
outstanding
d
nosferatu
is
exceptionally
drinkable
its
a
great
example
of
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
seasonal
got
this
brew
at
consumers
for
a
buy
one
get
one
free
growler
how
can
you
pass
up
free
beer
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
snifter
glass
very
hoppy
taste
almost
like
their
commodore
perry
ipa
but
yet
a
little
sweeter
and
darker
the
smell
was
delicious
wanted
to
just
just
jump
in
and
swim
very
dark
mahogany
red
in
the
glass
the
the
taste
threw
me
for
a
loop
however
despite
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
it
tended
to
be
a
too
bitter
of
the
finish
on
some
sips
for
me
but
all
in
all
another
fantastic
great
lakes
brew
d
drinkable
8
beer
not
the
most
flavorful
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
pretty
well
balanced
beer
that
goes
down
easy
enough
i
wasnt
amazed
but
a
solid
offering
overall
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
got
mine
at
krogers
here
in
barboursville
wv
for
12
99
and
the
expiration
date
was
a
couple
weeks
ago
but
i
bought
it
over
a
month
ago
still
very
good
d
high
sweetness
and
alcohol
prevent
drinkability
from
being
55
but
its
still
quite
high
drinkability
i
like
the
caramel
and
pine
hops
mix
the
sweet
and
bitter
mix
nicely
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
if
it
were
available
around
here
picked
up
a
single
to
try
the
best
before
date
was
drawing
near
but
it
still
had
a
nice
hop
bite
to
go
along
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
reminded
me
a
little
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
tasty
stuff
a
pretty
solid
effort
will
put
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
in
the
cellar
to
let
the
hops
fade
a
bit
taste
was
bitter
hops
raisins
bread
toasted
grains
faint
cherries
and
brown
sugar
good
drinkability
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
m
medium
body
slight
chew
lightly
carbonated
for
the
purpose
of
scores
i
compared
this
beer
to
arrogant
bastard
and
it
doesnt
come
close
frankly
i
dont
see
much
potential
in
red
ales
imperial
or
otherwise
12oz
bottle
purchased
from
wolverine
market
in
port
huron
michigan
pours
a
deep
ruby

with
a

sugary
malts
cocoa

dark

warming
booze
in
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamysmooth
fuller
than
medium
lasting
bitter
astringency
wet
and
biting
finish
a
standup
american
strong
ale
that
seems
better
suited
as
a
winter
release
rather
than
a
fall
seasonal
the
taste
is
equal
parts
barley
wine
imperial
amber
and
winter
warmer
which
makes
this
one
hell
of
a
unique
brew
an
excellent
offering
from
great
lakes
ohio
drinkability
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
perfect
choice
for
ending
a
great
day
on
the
town
definetely
recommend
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
that
said
it
was
a
good
experience
even
with
the
higher
than
average
abv
one
growler
is
no
problem
i
definatly
recommend
this
and
ill
be
sure
to
revisit
this
one
soon
moderately
carbonated
but
leaving
a
modicum
of
coating
on
the
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
its
not
exactly
cloying
but
a
bit
clingy
a
good
sipper
that
is
better
when
it
warms
up
just
a
bit
but
not
too
much
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
perfect
but
decent
i
wouldnt
bother
trying
unless
you
have
access
of
want
to
try
the
gl
lineup
otherwise
many
better
beers
in
the
style
all
in
all
a
good
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
good
sized
head
and
leaves
lace
patches
a
nutty
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
along
w
breadiness
or
toffee
and
some
tealike
hop
bitterness
medium
to
heavy
body
with
slick
sweetness
of
caramel
malt
along
with
bread
and
toffee
or
roasted
malts
what
is
w
me
and
this
toffee
for
a
dry
edge
to
the
beer
has
a
light
citric
floral
hops
balance
for
a
dry
finish
w
wellhidden
abv
for
proper
balance
not
overly
strong
like
some
of
these
ales
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
a
must
try
if
you
like
a
hoppier
beer
you
might
like
this
its
not
bad
just
not
what
i
would
come
back
to
notes
a
great
halloween
beer
it
seems
to
be
a
red
imperial
oktoberfest
very
enjoyable
look
forward
to
one
again
next
year
i
have
never
found
a
less
than
stellar
beer
from
great
lakes
keep
them
coming
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
id
suggest
anyone
to
try
very
different
and
very
unique
great
lakes
always
has
a
knack
for
surprising
me
bravo
very
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
smooth
for
an
8
strong
ale
the
hops
and
malt
are
so
nicely
melded
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
more
of
these
pours
a
dark
clear
red
with
a
good
amount
of
foam
tastes
quite
malty
with
a
bitter
finish
hops
lingering
in
slightly
too
makes
me
wonder
if
this
is
an
older
bottle
the
hops
seem
to
have
faded
a
little
drinks
down
very
smooth
though
and
theres
no
hint
of
the
8
alc
at
all
its
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
th
is
d
scary
at
8
doesnt
really
show
well
balanced
and
well
blended
array
of
flavors
an
interesting
take
on
the
stock
ale
very
clean
tasting
great
for
the
cool
rainy
evening
im
experiencing
now
would
love
to
have
this
again
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
a
murky
amber
with
a
short
lighttan
head
that
persists
for
quite
some
time
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
roasted
nuttiness
with
some
caramel
and
light
fruits
a
bit
of
earthy
and
pine
hops
faint
citrus
as
well
the
taste
melds
things
together
but
is
a
bit
plain
some
slightlysweet
cherrytasting
malt
and
a
bit
of
light
hops
feel
is
medium
and
a
bit
sweet
with
a
mild
bitterness
some
good
flavors
individually
but
i
dont
quite
like
how
everything
comes
together
in
the
end
d
this
is
one
of
my
favority
great
lakes
brews
if
not
my
1
i
feel
like
its
the
perfect
beer
for
me
to
transition
from
my
warm
weather
ipas
to
my
cold
weather
stouts
a
great
ale
and
at
8
i
dont
think
you
could
go
wrong
tastey
good
beer
the
strength
probably
puts
it
just
out
of
session
range
for
most
but
still
might
be
hard
to
refuse
a
second
one
or
a
third
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
lively
head
the
aroma
is
warm
a
cherrylike
but
with
some
earthy
and
grassy
quality
to
it
that
increases
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
like
a
dark
chocolatecovered
cherry
sweet
and
rich
and
bitter
with
a
delicious
spiciness
like
a
fruitcake
with
toasty
wheat
and
malt
there
is
a
wonderful
deep
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
chewy
overall
a
great
beer
but
i
would
prefer
third
coast
ale
over
this
anyday
drinkability
quite
good
great
lakes
brewing
tends
to
be
a
mixed
bag
for
me
but
this
was
my
cup
of
tea
american
barleywine
meets
english
dipa
it
blurs
a
lot
of
lines
in
a
good
way
satisfying
malt
character
with
citrusy
hops
make
this
terribly
drinkable
good
on
ya
great
lakes
medium
bodied
proper
carbonationand
there
is
a
nice
combination
of
sweetness
balanced
by
hop
bitterness
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
will
be
sure
to
look
for
it
again
d
really
good
for
a
strong
ale
old
ale
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
the
freshness
date
and
abv
on
the
label
deep
blood
red
color
not
too
much
of
a
head
good
carbonation
aroma
is
an
unique
blend
of
sweet
caramel
with
pine
unlike
any
i
have
had
so
far
the
taste
is
truly
exceptional
the
hops
hit
you
right
away
but
the
finish
is
maltysweet
the
abv
is
masked
very
well
amongst
the
bevy
of
flavors
that
hit
your
palate
drinkability
is
very
good
too
bad
it
is
a
seasonal
beer
highly
recommended
anyone
and
everyone
who
appreciates
beer
must
have
the
nosferatu
i
dont
know
how
they
do
it
but
great
lakes
is
another
brewery
that
keeps
churning
well
brewing
one
solid
beer
after
another
cheers
drink
by
date

d
not
high
for
me
intense
hops
make
it
tough
to
drink
it
consecutively
had
on
tap
at
pazzos
pizza
pub
a
the
beer
is
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
tight
white
head
that
recedes
into
lacing
for
the
entire
beer
smell
is
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
big
hop
pressance
taste
is
very
nice
crisp
citrus
hops
some
grapefruit
maybe
a
little
pin
and
grassy
hop
flavors
balance
by
a
nice
malt
backbone
that
doesnt
have
much
pressance
up
front
but
helps
round
out
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
crisp
and
light
very
drinkable
beer
you
definately
do
not
find
the
8
abv
in
this
one
i
honestly
was
expecting
more
hop
and
more
alchohol
in
this
one
d
very
interesting
i
would
like
more
probably
wouldnt
be
my
goto
but
you
never
say
never
at
least
i
dont
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
is
suitable
for
hop
lovers
when
fresh
d
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
the
one
good
thing
about
the
thin
mouthfeel
i
guess
is
that
it
lends
to
an
easier
drinking
brew
a
nice
choice
for
cooler
weather
and
another
good
one
from
great
lakes
having
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
quite
a
while
i
was
glad
to
pull
this
one
from
a
trade
package
earlier
this
week
poured
from
the
bottle
a
dark
red
color
with
a
little
bit
of
offwhite
foam
aromas
of
candi
sugar
sweet
malt
and
light
hops
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
caramel
sweet
malt
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
candy
sweet
finish
reminds
me
of
another
famous
beer
of
this
style
ab
but
hoppier
drinkability
would
i
risk
my
soul
for
one
more
probably
reddish
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
seems
to
be
a
balance
between
the
citrus
and
pine
hops
and
the
caramel
malt
no
hint
of
alcohol
is
detected
but
the
alcohol
sure
is
detected
in
the
flavor
the
flavor
starts
with
notes
of
grapefruit
pine
and
grass
the
malt
then
adds
its
contribution
of
caramel
and
a
little
toastiness
finishes
dry
and
boozy
the
body
seems
a
little
too
light
for
so
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
but
it
has
nice
carbonation
for
the
size
of
the
beer
an
interesting
beer
that
has
some
good
hop
flavor
and
some
malt
balance
d
decent
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
going
to
have
more
malt
and
a
less
hops
but
its
still
good
and
defiantly
worth
a
try
im
also
giving
5
extra
points
to
the
appearance
for
the
concept
of
the
beer
great
nosferatu
on
the
label
with
a
bloody
looking
beer
that
has
biting
hop
flavor
color
was
dark
brown
with
a
touch
of
reddish
hue
small
1
finger
off
white
head
that
laster
a
few
minutes
and
then
left
no
trace
aroma
was
slightly
berry
fruity
sweet
but
with
a
touch
of
acid
bitterness
maybe
akin
to
a
raspberry
taste
was
completely
unlike
the
aroma
it
had
a
hoppy
bitterness
to
the
flavor
with
the
piney
aftertaste
hopes
became
more
pronounced
as
it
went
on
felt
thin
in
the
mouch
otherwise
was
well
balanced
nicely
carbonated
abv
hit
hard
and
fast
despite
being
otherwise
fairly
well
balanced
and
drinkable
o
comes
across
as
a
double
ipa
not
a
bad
thing
just
something
to
consider
before
you
make
a
purchase
wow
i
am
really
not
a
big
fan
of
the
the
style
but
this
was
great
d
overall
didnt
expect
this
old
ale
to
be
so
hoppy
liked
it
and
will
have
it
again
awesome
d
a
decent
enough
redstrong
ale
but
nothing
really
stood
out
about
it
i
enjoyed
the
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hops
but
would
have
liked
more
out
of
it
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
annd
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
glass
a
transparent
dark
amber
with
a
very
thick
off
white
head
its
allergy
season
so
my
nose
is
worthless
but
i
am
getting
a
good
hint
of
hops
in
the
scent
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
iipa
and
a
barleywine
mix
there
is
carmel
malts
and
sugars
with
a
good
hop
representation
that
leaves
a
dry
bitterness
medium
body
in
the
mouthfeel
with
no
apparent
alcohol
burn
nosferatu
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
i
wish
glb
distributed
to
texas
notes
now
this
is
great
lakes
quality
to
remember
despite
a
couple
of
not
so
good
tries
of
late
this
is
putting
me
back
on
their
path
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
nearly
done
tasting
my
first
bottle
of
this
and
im
surprised
it
went
as
quick
as
it
did
not
heavy
but
i
can
myself
wanting
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
a
few
of
these
due
to
the
high
hop
character
extremely
happy
i
went
with
my
urge
to
pick
this
one
up
cheers
md
full
bodied
and
no
hint
of
the
8
whatsoever
overall
a
really
nice
beer
very
drinkable
highly
enjoyable
nice
dark
gold
color
and
head
retention
aroma
has
a
lot
of
hops
and
almost
get
that
fresh
hop
smell
with
some
malts
really
like
this
beer
good
amount
of
hops
as
well
as
malt
so
no
matter
what
you
are
looking
for
this
seems
to
hit
the
spot
again
like
the
other
ales
from
glb
it
has
a
lot
of
body
with
it
this
one
im
sad
that
it
would
be
hard
to
find
at
home
d
although
an
excellent
beer
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
can
definitely
sit
on
one
for
a
while
do
drinkability
suffers
some
due
to
the
high
abv
but
who
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
bad
boys
anyways
this
is
a
special
beer
and
having
more
than
one
would
devalue
that
cheers
to
glbc
for
an
all
around
winner
aging
a
couple
of
these
for
a
rainy
day
down
the
road
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
every
day
d
at
8
masked
pretty
well
nicely
balanced
great
beer
m
highly
carbonated
dry
and

bodied

a
really
nice
red
clear
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
shows
some
good
lace
as
it
settles
the
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
both
hops
and
malt
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
really
does
remind
me
of
a
ncie
fall
day
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
some
what
biscuity
flavor
that
transitions
to
a
decently
hoppy
bite
that
lingers
this
beer
is
like
a
toned
down
dipa
but
in
a
good
way
really
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
red
amber
color
with
a

recedes
to
a

its
scary
drinkable
no

8
solid
sstrong

buy
this
one
quick
it
is
great
a
wonderful
highly
hopped
malt
special
tasty
and
complex
with
a
super
maltyhoppy
combo
had
this
ontap
at
tjs
poured
a
reddishamber
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
which
dissaptes
to
a
coating
lacing

ample
and
lasting

is

taste
is
sweet

bready
malts
tempered
by
the
bitter
grapefuit
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
brew
is
mildly
sticky
and
oily
it
is
a
little
sticky
but
not
unpleasantly
so
there
is
no
hint
of
the
higher
abv
in
the
taste
but
it
is
the
only
thing
preventing
me
from
having
another
overall
a
very
good
beer
ive
never
tasted
this
type
of
flavor
combination
its
a
bit
like
a
combination
of
different
ipas
missed
out
on
this
last
year
so
its
nice
that
we
happened
upon
it
at
the
firk
tonight
it
pours
a
russet
halloween
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
spicy
caramel
thats
what
i
wrote
i
hope
it
makes
sense
to
someone
else
light
booze
and
red
grapes
the
taste
goes
in
a
slightly
different
direction
with
notes
of
grapefruit
light
caramel
heavy
pine
sap
and
cedar
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
rather
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thickly
watery
or
watery
thick
feel
overall
i
gotta
say
i
wasnt
enthralled
with
this
brew
but
its
not
all
that
horrible
either
i
like
the
disjointedness
but
i
cant
see
myself
seeking
it
out
very
often
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
really
nice
strong
red
ale
or
stock
ale
the
flavors
do
develop
with
the
warming
of
the
brew
nicely
done
and
tastes
really
good
outdoors
on
an
autumn
night
while
the
sun
is
sinking
low
m
sweet
on
the
lips
juicy
with
a
quick
dry
finish
the
appearance
is
of
a
nice
brownish
red
with
a
decent
finger
of
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
mostly
of
sour
and
char
there
are
some
citrusy
hop
aromas
most
similar
to
orange
zest
but
thats
not
nearly
as
strong
as
the
burnt
notes
the
flavor
is
strongly
of
burnt
biscuit
a
slight
malty
flavor
comes
in
on
the
back
end
to
try
and
rectify
the
damage
done
but
it
is
too
late
the
burnt
biscuit
flavor
is
really
off
putting
to
the
point
where
i
truly
dont
like
this
beer
the
mixing
of
the
hop
flavor
with
it
makes
it
seem
like
someone
lit
hops
on
fire
before
putting
them
in
this
brew
the
good
thing
is
the
bitterness
doesnt
translate
too
badly
on
the
mouthfeel
but
it
is
still
there
to
a
point
i
dont
care
for
despite
the
smooth
nature
of
the
drink
this
beer
is
all
sorts
of
intense
that
i
really
dont
care
to
go
into
its
harsh
in
a
number
of
ways
and
honestly
some
might
enjoy
drinking
it
but
i
could
go
either
way
not
something
id
really
recommend
or
seek
out
again
d
not
too
bad
alcohol
is
not
that
present
for
8
abv
d
i
was
impressed
how
easily
quickly
i
drank
this
great
strong
aleimperial
red
i
will
most
definitely
get
this
again
held
up
to
light
nosferatu
has
a
great
ruby
red
color
with
some
offwhite
head
that
at
first
produces
some
elaborate
lacing
which
eventually
slides
down
the
glass
head
retention
itself
was
great
the
lacing
however
did
not
maintain
itself
but
that
doesnt
really
matter
to
me
really
strong
citrus
hops
aromas
with
a
rich
malty
background
i
got
some
grapefruit
coming
through
but
balanced
out
with
the
malts
smelled
fantastic
after
a
couple
sips
i
couldnt
help
but
think
about
just
how
balanced
this
beer
is
while
you
get
plenty
of
hops
at
first
they
are
never
overbearing
or
offensive
the
wet
and
sticky
hop
goodness
is
quickly
followed
by
a
slight
sweetness
and
malt
flavors
very
well
carbonated
but
it
still
coats
the
tongue
with
its
flavors
and
character
after
a
while
you
get
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
going
down
deceptively
drinkable
and
delicious
i
had
only
had
this
once
before
but
will
hopefully
grab
it
a
few
more
times
before
the
season
is
over
drinkability
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
each
sip
followed
naturally
and
easily
and
im
sure
ill
be
seeking
out
this
beer
again
in
the
future
it
has
found
a
place
on
my
shopping
list
d
this
was
an
exceptional
ale
think
of
a
west
coast
hoppy
red
and
kick
it
up
a
few
notches
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavors
that
the
malts
brought
to
this
beer
this
is
definitely
and
autumn
seasonal
ill
be
going
after
again
and
again
d
great
lakes
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
brews
nosferatu
has
completely
drinkable
and
delicious
properties
this
will
be
a
beer
that
i
will
forever
keep
going
back
to
i
will
grab
a
case
of
this
for
a
halloween
get
together
no
doubt
d
the
dry
finish
and
pleasant
character
of
this
beer
leaves
you
wanting
more
if
it
werent
so
darn
expensive
for
a
4pack
itd
be
a
session
beer
but
if
you
make
six
or
seven
figures
a
year
hell
enjoy
dive
heard
a
lot
of
people
try
to
compare
some
brews
with
this
ie
arrogant
bastard
but
really
i
dont
think
they
are
even
in
the
same
ball
park
with
this
being
easy
drink
with
some
decent
flavor
it
is
really
only
feeling
average
for
me
with
nothing
to
great
about
it
beer
is
very
caramelly
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
finishes
cleanly
overall
its
a
little
light
on
flavor
i
guess
strong
ale
i
want
it
to
be
maltier
or
heavier
drinkability
is
good
but
its
too
light
t
very
smooth
taste
without
any
distinct
flavors
aside
from
the
standard
ale
taste
definite
hop
taste
with
some
bitterness
overall
good
beer
but
lacks
the
character
of
other
ales
overall
damn
drinkable
for
an
8
brew
really
excellent
to
drink
at
the
turning
of
the
seasons
sweet
but
bitter
as
hell
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
when
i
lived
in
cleveland
and
definitely
worth
seeking
this
beauty
out
the
drinkability
is
average
while
the
alcohol
is
not
too
overpowering
the
hops
can
be
over
the
course
of
the
bottle
i
could
drink
two
but
by
the
end
my
palate
would
need
a
bit
of
a
rest
however
i
have
a
feeling
that
ill
be
craving
this
with
increasing
zeal
as
the
weather
grows
ever
colder
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
the
citrus
flavor
is
a
bit
too
bright
for
me
so
the
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
but
otherwise
pretty
good
drinkability
just
a
stellar
beer
seems
like
a
double
ipa
with
a
slightly
different
malt
base
this
has
more
than
redeemed
my
faith
in
great
lakes
after
my
subpar
opinion
of
their
octoberfest
vampire
pro
they
live
without
lights
which
really
helps
to
conserve
energy
vampires
are
earth
friendly
with
green
in
mind
had
on
tap
at
mad
mex
bartender
said
this
was
a
worthwhile
brew
to
try
appears
amberish
in
color
with
nice
lacing
clinging
to
the
pint
glass
in
ring
set
sequences
smells
mostly
hoppy
with
pine
citrus
and
peppery
notes
tastes
mostly
hoppy
with
a
subdued
malt
backbone
thats
hidden
behind
this
abundance
of
hops
should
this
be
an
ipa
the
strong
ale
label
complexes
me
either
way
its
a
slow
drinking
hoppy
beer
with
bitter
mouthfeel
and
dry
then
sweet
mouthfeel
sees
like
a
sipper
to
me
this
is
another
excellent
brew
from
great
lakes
and
worth
seeking
out
notes
this
beer
has
great
flavor
and
depth
but
it
lacks
a
bit
in
body
for
the
style
overall
nosferatu
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
thats
tasty
as
hell
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
pretty
decent
at
8
as
i
really
dont
feel
much
alcohol
burn
the
astringency
from
the
hops
detracts
some
i
think
this
should
be
brewed
more
regularly
and
it
could
be
ohios
own
take
on
a
beer
like
arrogant
bastard
overall
a
great
ale
from
gl
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
their
brews
this
is
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
nasferatu
is
a
beer
that
will
bite
your
palate
with
flavor
but
dont
fight
it
this
isnt
a
monster
of
the
bloodsucking
kind
instead
its
an
imperial
red
ale
thats
sure
to
please
the
palate
with
rich
sweet
toasty
malts
and
a
coffin
full
of
hops
an
awesome
beer
and
certainly
deserving
of
all
the
praise
it
receives
great
lakes
was
making
this
beer
long
before
twilight
made
vampires
trendy
and
its
occult
following
will
continue
long
after
the
trend
has
passed
poured
a
reddishamber
with
minimal
head
should
have
been
more
aggressive
on
the
pour
nose
is
primarily
piney
hops
some
grapefruit
malt
sweetness
lingering
in
the
background
bitter
from
start
to
finish
hoppy
to
the
extreme
with
faint
caramel
malt
pine
and
grapefruit
are
overt
in
this
wet
finish
hints
of
an
imperial
ipa
but
not
as
assertive
mouthfeel
is
lightish
drinkability
moderate
another
truly
world
class
beer
from
great
lakes
a
big
win
another
well
made
beer
from
clbc
its
a
late
night
beer
its
a
beer
that
id
consume
as
fresh
as
possible
i
had
this
last
year
and
after
2
months
it
wasnt
this
good
overall
well
done
balanced
strong
beer
the
hops
fruit
and
sweetness
take
you
on
a
journey
the
american
citrus
hops
mix
in
with
the
chocolate
almost
tasting
like
a
chocolate
covered
orange
candy
im
a
big
fan
of
great
lakes
and
this
beer
just
impresses
me
further
d
not
the
easiest
to
take
down
could
probably
only
have
one
of
these
every
once
in
awhile
overall
not
a
bad
beer
however
for
the
flavors
that
come
out
of
this
i
would
much
rather
have
a
good
stout
d
really
great
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
and
was
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
i
would
drink
again
for
sure
thanks
to
ryan
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beer
clear
copper
pour
with
a
quickly
fading
head
and
not
much
lacing
this
one
is
all
malt
in
the
nose
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
really
earthy
side
to
it
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
initially
but
is
soon
dominated
by
the
earthiness
the
hops
were
absent
in
the
nose
but
they
show
up
with
lots
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
the
toasted
malt
gives
decent
balance
but
that
bitter
hop
bite
lingers
and
overpowers
for
the
most
part
its
a
bit
too
earthy
to
be
very
drinkable
for
me
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
more
balance
but
not
a
bad
beer
ill
update
this
review
if
my
next
experience
goes
better
color
is
a
beautiful
menacing
amber
red
smell
is
of
rich
earthy
malts
but
also
a
bit
metallic
mouth
feel
is
smooth
taste
is
a
twotone
sweetness
finished
off
with
overripe
citrus
notes
for
the
hops
very
clean
all
in
all
for
such
a
badass
beer
this
one
is
pleasant
in
a
darklight
sort
of
way
the
label
conjures
up
thoughts
that
otherwise
sway
opinion
it
is
not
the
monster
it
is
made
out
to
be
its
actually
quite
pleasant
the
best
great
lakes
seasonal
4pack
so
far
this
is
definitely
a
finely
crafted
beer
and
one
i
will
revisit
in
the
future
d
very
easy
drinker
i
would
have
said
it
was
more
of
an
altbier
though
now
that
gl
is
distributed
by
me
im
looking
forward
to
picking
up
some
more
let
this
warm
up
my
first
sip
just
a
couple
minuets
out
of
the
fridge
was
way
too
cold
hops
are
present
here
but
take
a
back
seat
to
the
very
nice
and
complex
malt
base
very
sweet
and
toasty
it
leaves
my
lips
a
bit
sticky
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
carbonations
is
a
bit
high
but
not
offensive
at
all
overall
a
great
beer
although
i
dont
know
if
id
call
it
an
old
ale
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
slick
smooth
feel
fairly
easy
drinker
though
the
finish
is
a
bit
harsh
body
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
full
this
is
a
really
good
strong
ale
lots
of
flavor
thanks
doverall
this
is
a
good
not
great
beer
and
i
think
id
have
to
have
another
to
see
if
its
worth
putting
on
any
kind
of
wants
list
follow
up
notes
from
tasting
second
bottle
on
69
hop
flavors
had
subsided
a
little
but
the
result
is
that
the
overly
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
show
up
more
strongly
i
left
my
score
the
same
but
would
not
seek
this
out
again
overall
this
aint
too
bad
of
an
old
aleamerican
strong
ale
but
it
could
use
some
more
work
and
refinement
it
exhibits
the
hop
bite
of
a
good
barleywine
along
with
some
rich
fruity
flavors
but
the
heat
on
the
front
end
drags
the
general
enjoyment
of
this
beer
down
a
notch
a
nice
brandy
color
with
some
orangegolden
highlights
smallish
sandy
head
that
fades
quickly
getting
some
chocolate
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
vegetal
aroma
that
im
not
sure
i
like
taste
kicks
you
a
bit
big
malt
flavors
bookended
with
some
herbal
and
floral
hops
hops
linger
with
some
herbal
and
piney
notes
mf
is
a
nice
medium
body
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
decent
carbonation
good
drinkability
though
im
not
sure
that
the
taste
is
really
what
im
looking
for
definitely
more
in
the
vein
of
a
strong
ale
than
an
old
ale
there
are
some
really
great
parts
of
this
beer
but
then
also
some
parts
that
i
dont
like
so
much
a
nice
beer
certainly
unique
to
style
with
this
being
the
hoppiest
ive
tasted
to
date
d
good
tasty
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
slightly
hopped
up
barleywine
when
i
tried
it
its
a
good
ale
but
old
ale
is
a
category
ive
come
to
expect
great
things
from
d
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
awhile
and
it
was
pretty
good
but
not
as
outstanding
as
i
had
hoped
id
have
it
again
though
and
perhaps
try
a
younger
bottle
next
time
d
when
i
first
bought
them
i
drank
two
and
decided
to
age
the
other
ones
i
am
going
to
revisit
this
one
in
september
and
see
how
it
developed
and
compare
to
a
fresh
one
d
its
not
bad
just
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
dbig
time
lingering
bitterness
at
the
finish
makes
this
a
tough
sell
for
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
quite
tasty
and
very
creamy
i
want
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
compare
overall
nothing
too
standoutish
here
from
gl
but
again
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
like
usual
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
light
carbonation
d
a
superbly
drinkable
though
highly
hopped
strong
ale
not
something
i
would
expect
to
be
8
alcohol
something
i
would
love
to
see
stuck
in
a
barrel
for
a
few
months
d
the
abv
would
kill
me
after
a
while
but
this
ipaeque
beer
is
vibrant
and
full
of
flavor
hardly
a
dull
offering
from
great
lakes
d
despite
being
rather
potent
it
has
very
good
drinkability
its
a
high
quality
brew
from
great
lakes
that
im
glad
to
have
access
to
once
a
year
recommended
nice
thick
finger
plus
head
of
mixed

from

mediumbodied
theres
more
foaminess
than
expected
during
the
mouth
entry
after
that
the
carbonation
settles
down
while
very
much
in
balance
the
hops
come
out
ahead
by
a
good
bit

pine

an

at

never
truly
making
it
taste
sweet
at
any
given
moment
blend
of
apple
pear
peach
banana
cherry
fruit
yet
with
minimal
sweetness
its
an
unusual
beer
which
certainly
holds
your
attention
d
strong
warming
and
delish
4s
all
around
d
i
think
this
is
a
great
mix
between
an
ipa
and
a
old
ale
really
never
had
anything
like
this
before
i
would
say
to
not
cellar
this
since
the
weirdness
is
part
of
the
fun
really
great
and
different
beer
although
i
havent
had
one
fresh
i
bet
age
has
done
this
some
wonders
to
this
and
toned
down
the
hops
considerably
allowing
the
maltychocolatey
flavors
to
come
forward
thanks
to
smelleesell
for
the
bottle
overall
a
nice
strong
ale
from
great
lakes
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
its
a
good
one
none
the
less
i
dont
think
if
this
was
available
to
me
it
would
be
one
of
my
regulars
but
it
was
good
and
fun
to
try
thanks
again

had
learned
of
some
interest
in
this
beer
from
ba
and
since
i
was
at
the
brewery
i
thought
that
i
would
step
out
of
my
usual
comfort
and
try
this
very
hoppy
beer
this
experience
will
discourage
me
from
doing
that
again
soon
i
cannot

this

it
says
that
it
is
an
old
ale
regardless
2008
4244444overall
like
a
good
strong
ale
should
be
the
main
elements
here
are
the
chocolate
biscuit
malts
and
the
grassy
and
citrus
hops
the
appearance
is
a
dark
red
with
offwhite
lacing
the
aroma
focuses
on
grassy
hops
with
a
hit
of
sharp
grapefruit
and
peel
the
hops
are
interesting
and
seem
to
have
a
celery
note
i
cant
decide
if
i
like
how
they
work
with
the
malt
full
body
with
mediumlow
carbonation
very
satisfying
and
pretty
drinkable
considering
would
be
truly
excellent
with
a
few
less
ibus
skizziksmar
23
and
ample
malt
backing
tastes
like
slightly
alcoholic
hopped
melted
caramel
squares
unique
d
very
disappointing
especially
after
loving
the
appearance
and
smell
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
and
very
very
smooth
carbonation
is
excellent
very
drinkable
despite
its
somewhat
high
abv
very
nice
offering
from
great
lakes
if
only
it
were
available
year
round
for
taste
i
wish
i
were
better
at
explaining
different
hops
but
the
hops
come
through
as
just
bitter
you
dont
get
that
awful
grape
fruit
flavor
that
many
ipas
are
using
today
this
is
mixed
with
a
strong
ale
reminds
me
a
bit
of
third
coast
ale
instead
of
the
normal
strong
malt
finish
of
say
90
minute
you
get
a
nice
crisp
yet
sweet
finish
with
a
nice
bit
of
alcohol
backing
it
for
a
beer
of
this
size
and
strength
the
mouthfeel
and
drink
ability
match
it
perfectly
you
can
easily
drink
23
of
these
without
realizing
it
yet
even
on
the
first
you
know
that
you
probably
shouldnt
keep
drinking
them
all
day
very
well
balanced
beer
i
would
describe
this
as
an
ipa
with
a
greater
than
usual
carmel
malt
prescence
if
that
makes
sense
i
like
the
mix
of
the
carmellike
sweet
malts
with
fairly
strong
hops
prescence
which
is
unique
very
drinkable
as
the
abv
is
well
hidden
id
love
to
do
a
blind
tasting
of
this
along
with
big
hoppy
monster
lagunitas
impy
red
and
hop
rod
rye
d
complex
beer
but
still
highly
drinkable
surprised
to
see
that
this
was
8
will
seek
this
out
again
this
is
one
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
annually
as
its
a
nice
change
from
the
marzens
and
pumpkin
ales
that
abound
this
time
of
year
pours
a
clear
rich
redcopper
color
with
soapy
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
smells
of
citrus
toasted
malt
and
some
caramel
sweetness
caramel
sweet
up
front
cut
off
sharply
by
an
attack
of
grapefruit
some
spices
mix
in
along
with
a
slightly
warm
alcohol
presence
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
good
hop
stick
to
the
palate
a
good
ale
similar
to
arrogant
bastard
but
a
little
more
grapefruity
almost
seems
more
like
it
should
be
an
imperial
ipa
than
a
strong
ale
d
a
really
nice
beer
but
i
would
almost
class
it
as
an
ipa
or
pa
and
less
of
a
stock
ale
didnt
have
any
of
the
alcohol
burn
i
would
expect
with
a
stock
ale
a
great
beer
to
scrath
a
hop
itch
if
youve
grown
tired
of
the
ipas
great
lakes
brews
awesome
beer
and
this
is
right
up
with
the
best
of
them
beautiful
and
notable
clear
red
amber
color
with
half
inch
head
of
finely
bubble
foam
plenty
of
lacing
gentle
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
surprising
mouthful
of
flavor
tastes
sweet
at
first
but
the
sweetness
is
backed
of
by
a
pile
of
hoppy
bitterness
to
my
tastes
this
is
very
nicely
balanced
a
full
mouthfeel
with
fine
prickly
carbonation
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
of
this
fine
ale
if
i
was
drinking
this
blind
i
would
call
it
an
ipa
the
next
thing
i
would
call
for
would
be
another
one
drinkability
is
high
and
this
is
quite
tasty
once
again
nicely
done
by
great
lakes
drinkability
a
really
fine
ale
that
balances
nicely
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
this
was
tough
to
rate
didnt
look
at
other
reviews
to
see
if
what
i
feel
are
off
flavours
are
present
in
fresher
tasting
or
not
i
went
nice
on
this
brew
as
i
suspect
the
off
flavours
present
were
my
fault
for
sitting
on
this
too
long
nosferatu
is
another
good
beer
froom
great
lakes
i
guess
that
goes
without
saying
i
believe
the
american
strong
ale
category
is
designed
to
be
a
catchall
of
sorts
but
this
beer
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
iipa
great
lakes
calls
it
a
stock
ale
try
one
and
decide
for
yourself
drinkability
is
good
but
there
are
huge
flavors
and
a
sizable
abv
recommended
d
i
wish
this
was
available
in

area
thanks
to

great

yeah
ill
have
another
not
really
sure
why
its
taken
me
this
long
to
have
a
first
one
really
well
balanced
very
enjoyable
beer
poured
with
less
head
then
others
have
eluded
to
but
the
head
did
not
completely
dissipate
a
copper
red
color
smell
is
rather
pleasant
and
there
is
a
strong
fruity
scent
somewhere
between
grapfruit
and
grape
as
pointed
out
by
others
taste
was
not
as
pleasant
as
expected
strong
hops
flavor
but
much
less
of
the
fruit
suggested
by
the
scent
the
alcohol
content
is
not
well
hidden
ive
had
worse
but
ive
had
much
bettereven
at
910
mouthfeel
is
average
and
the
beer
is
easiy
drinkable
but
id
stop
after
a
couple
wondering
what
it
tastes
like
on
tap
perhaps
it
is
just
me
but
there
is
some
balance
lacking
here
still
pleasant
notes
like
everything
great
lakes
brews
this
is
a
quality
beer
although
i
really
like
this
beer
id
like
it
if
it
was
a
bit
more
distinguished
from
the
commodore
perry
ipa
maybe
a
little
more
emphasis
on
the
malts
i
dont
know
what
its
lacking
its
just
not
as
clearly
defined
stylistically
as
other
seasonals
are
or
for
its
9
a
4pack
price
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
from
this
company
bright
and
clean
but
still
moderately
heavy
on
the
tongue
low
to
moderate
carbonation
that
increases
to
clean
up
a
pronounced
warmth
in
the
finish
d
overall
pretty
good
i
can
somewhat
feel
and
taste
the
8
abv
but
the
taste
is
intriguing
enough
to
make
me
want
more
nosferatu
is
slowly
overtaking
christmas
ale
as
my
favorite
great
lakes
brew
if
only
everything
to
come
out
of
cleveland
was
this
good
like
the
name
implies
this
beer
has
bite
excellent
hoppy
flavor
like
an
ipa
but
it
is
actually
a
red
beer
loved
it
nosferatu
has
great
color
i
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
beer
glass
the
one
with
the
wide
mouth
and
it
was
very
impressive
in
flavor
if
you
like
red
beers
and
also
like
ipas
then
you
will
definitely
like
the
nosferatu
by
great
lakes
i
am
a
big
fan
of
all
of
the
great
lakes
beers
i
have
had
so
far
overall
a
tasty
and
potent
strong
ale
remarable
drinkable
considering
the
abv
dthis
is
a
nicely

ale
it
drinks

being

being

more

i
gotta
get

starts
falling
overall
its
fighting
arrogant
bastard
for
my
favorite
american
strong
ale
and
could
quite
possibly
be
my
favorite
great
lakes
beer
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
glbs
it
is
certainly
a
good
choice
if
you
like
arrogant

are
looking
for
better

is
it

and
bitter

any
8rrr
ive
ever
had
this
at
8
and
the
oktoberfest
at
6
5ish
now
theres
two
beers
that
can
get
you
in
trouble
because
of
the
high
abv
and
the
extremely
high
drinkability
nice
florals
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
sweetness
lasts
much
longer
than
many
other
reds
moderate
carbonation
seems
about
right
something
gives
it
a
little
bit
of
a
metallicness
something
ive
not
experienced
with
their
other
offerings
good
but
not
spectacular
i
would
drink
this
again
one
of
the
better
red
beers
out
there
wow
this
beer
certainly
does
have
bite
it
reminds
me
alot
of
some
hoppy
ambers
ive
had
but
that
thick
mouthfull
and

it
up

definitely
not
a
beer
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
in

sitting
but
rather
one
to
savor
and
warm
up
with
during
those
cold

drinkability

were

having
this
did
give

i
love
that

can
drink
this

thought
its
8
abv

catch
up

it
is
frustrating
that
it
is
only
sold
in
4
packs

that

has
chosen
to
use
both
the

and
the
image
of

for
this
beer
where
nosferatu
the
film
was
an
innovator
the
beer
version
falls
short
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
nosferatu
just
falls
short
the
color
is
almost
rubylike
with
decent
head
formation
but
little
retention
there
is
plenty
of
stickiness
and
lacing
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
both
sweet
and
fruity
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
not
rich
enough
for
this
style
which
therefore
hinders
the
overall
drinkability
a
fine
strong
ale
with
a
marketing
gimmick
close
to
my
heart
recommended
drinkability
recommended
i
will
search
this
one
out
again
i
think
that
i
like
arrogant
bastard
a
bit
just
a
little
more
for
an
american
strong
ale
overall
definitely
a
very
hoppy
strong
ale

entirely
in
the
american
tradition

hop
bite
is
more
subtle
than
i
expected
from
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
but
the
carbonation
is
very
good
and
helps
to
hide
the
alcohol
wickedly
well
d
with
as
balanced
as
this
beer
is
i
could
definitely
drink
a
bunch
of
these
i
think
if
you
served
at
35
degreesto
dumb
down
the
bite
a
bit
you
could
spark
new
ideas
and
interest
in

how
great

this

is
full

so
damn
balanced
it
is
amazing
the
finish
is
long
and
deep
and

by
toasted

i
love

for

on

definitely
a
success
in
both

and
packaging

i
feel
that
nosferatu
has
that
vampire
type
bite

dark
side
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
into
the
galss
with
a
fairly
thin

like
caramel

the
smell
isnt
terribly
strong

tastes
very
sweet

well
lots
of
rich
maltiness
almost
syrupy
it
does
finish
with

overall
a

beer
its
a

too
sweet
and
strong
for
me
to
want
to
drink
often
but
could
really
hit
the
spot
in
the
right
mood
drinkability
is
a
little
rough
with
this
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
powerful
and
huge
which
takes
some
time
to
savor
between
sips
pours
a
very
deep
redamber
with
little
head
that
dissipates
down
into
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
dark
fruits
and
some
sweet
breadiness
taste
is
a
woody
maltiness
with
a
nice
smoky
flavor
cleared
off
by
mild
citrus
and
dominant
pine
hops
hops
overpower
the
malts
and
make
it
a
touch
too
bitter
for
my
taste
dry
finish
and
refreshing
d
sure
arrogant
bastard
may
be
considered
the
king
of
this
style
but
if
thats
the
case
nosferatu
is
the
prince
this
beer
is
only
slightly
aggressive
and
completely
balanced
with
almost
no
trace
of
alcohol
to
throw
anything
off
highly
recommended
pours
a
vibrant
deep

decent
carbonation

to
a

more
sweet

aftertaste
hints
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
crisp
from
the
bitterness
for
such
a
flavorful
beer
it
almost
seems
to
clean
the
palate
another
great
lakes
gem
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
went
down
clean
and
alcohol
was
unnoticable
so
good
points
there
but
just
not
interesting
enough
to
delight
the
tongue
for
very
long
this
is
super
easy
to
drink
a
bit
like
a
large
ipa
with
its
balance
not
an
overhopped
dipa
good
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel

just
the

the

seems
to
have

a

while
this
beer
continues
to
evolve
and
hold
up
wellpast
its
expiration
date
in
my
opinion
this
is
best
consumed
fresh
the
body
is
medfull
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
but
somehow
the
mouthfeel
remains
very
fluid
and

viscous

an

lackluster

i
will
probably
review
this
fresh
in
the
future
this
is
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
i
found
it
to
be
surprisingly
subtle
and
mild
i
could
see
this
one
sneaking
up
on
me
its
that
good
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
bold
and
interesting
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
a
nice
fairly
easy
drinking
strong
ale
12oz
bottle
poured
a
deep
reddish
color
with
small
slightly
tan
head
that
doesnt
leave
any
lace
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
toasted
malt
and
citrusy
hops
taste
is
very
bitter
at
first
with
a
sour
bitter
like
grapefruit
flavor
and
just
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
malt
with
some
dryness
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
lightmedium
and
nicely
carbonated
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
brew
after
the
initial
shock
of
the
bitterness
and
i
could
see
myself
easily
downing
a
few
of
these
fourth
trial
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
before
at
what
tastes
like
varying
degrees
of
freshness
the
first
few
times
ive
had
it
it
had
a
great
hop
presence
a
nice
malty
backbone
and
a
bit
of
rye
flavore
however
this
time
it
was
much
less
hoppy
and
the
malt
and
alcohol
seemed
to
have
taken
a
more
dominant
position
it
was
still
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
first
few
trials
when
both
are
fresh
i
slightly
prefer
founders
reds
rye
which
tastes
quite
similar
to
me
but
to
me
this
beer
seems
to
age
a
bit
better
still
rather
have
it
fresh
though
overall
a
great
beer
great
looking
great
lacing
great
smelling
and
great
tasting
d
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
content
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
had
two
bottles
on
halloween
evening
and
i
was
feeling
no
pain
recommend
cant
pronounce
the
name
but
a
darn
good
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
bright
copper
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
lingered
for
most
of
the
glass
and
left
good
lavcing
aroma
was
a
very
pleasant
blend
of
malty
dark
fruit
and
floral
grassy
hops
flavor
was
more
on
the
bitter
hoopy
side
and
aa
the
beer
warmed
the
8
alcohol
made
itself
more
known
palate
was
slightly
bitter
and
the
finish
was
smooth
and
slightly
warming
d
apply
named
after
the
vampire
as
it
combines
the
blood
red
color
and
hop
bite
with
the
warm
sting
of
the
alcohol
at
8
it
is
hypnotically
drinkable
so
have
your
cross
at
the
ready
to
avoid
falling
under
its
spell
drinkability
not
so
great
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
is
tasted
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
drinability
the
8
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
there
is
sweetness
and
bitterness
honestly
for
what
it
is
the
drinkability
is
really
quite
nice
this
really
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
cannot
believe
i
let
it
sit
around
for
this
long
a
month
or
so
in
the
realm
of
a
dipa
i
think
just
because
of
the
hopiness
thanks
vancer
you
gave
me
very
little
bs
poured
a
ruby
red
amber
with
a
huge
off
white
head
had
a
decent
retention
so
a
slow
fade
left
a
nice
quarter
inch
film
on
the
top
some
strings
of
small
bubble
chains
pouring
through
the
glass
and
a
nice
clingy
lace
made
a
good
starting
impression
on
this
one
smell
started
off
with
some
bread
and
yeast
tones
but
soon
warmed
to
reveal
a
nice
hop
presence
grapefruit
and
orange
very
sweet
and
well
balanced
the
taste
started
off
very
hoppy
grapefruit
pineapple
fresh
tasting
fely
a
bit
slick
when
sipping
not
watered
down
at
all
though
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
but
not
bad
just
enough
to
let
you
know
it
was
there
the
sweetness
and
bittersour
were
very
well
balanced
off
of
each
other
and
in
the
malts
vs
hops
war
there
was
no
definitive
winner
in
this
one
this
was
a
great
brew
very
drinkable
and
very
nice
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
d
very
complex
and
extremely
balanced
a
very
mixture
nice
of
sweet
and
tart
and
dry
and
full
d
very
well
balanced
very
tasty
would
for
sure
get
this
one
again
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
recieved
this
in
a
trade
from
nlmartin
a
long
time
ago
held
up
very
well
thanks
for
the
awesome
brew
overall
a
spectacular
ale
the
spicy
grittiness
reminds
me
of
awesome
rye
ipas
ripa
ive
tried
take
everything
i
stated
above
as
gospel
for
this
great
beer
truly
unique
bold
and
friendly
for
having
such
a
creepy
lore
and
label
hatsoff
again
to
glbc
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
very
good
drinkability
i
stumbled
upon
this
bottle
at
capones
in
norristown
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
the
nose
was
malty
and
sweet
refreshing
the
taste
was
a
malty
hoppy
mix
that
was
balanced
well
and
a
pleasure
on
my
tongue
although
there
was
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
that
lasts
in
your
mouth
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
this
is
another
dangerously
drinkable
brew
from
glb
at
8
it
sure
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
kinda
like
a
blood
sucking
vampire
would
sneak
up
on
you
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
little
golden
hue
around
the
edges
not
to
much
of
a
head
but
high
alcohol
will
do
that
smells
hoppy
grapefruit
and
grass
clippings
on
the
nose
tastes
the
same
a
bit
like
a
less
sharp
arrogant
bastard
definite
grapefruit
and
fresh
hops
from
the
pacific
northwest
a
very
good
asa
enjoyed
very
thin
film
of
head
that
is
rather
dark
trying
to
be
the
same
as
the
beer
hops
are
first
on
the
palate
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
but
then
a
bold
malt
flavor
matches
up
evenly
with
the
hops
this
one
is
hearty
the
finish
is
balanced
with
a
sharp
bitterness
from
the
hops
kicking
back
at
the
last
second
a
good
froth
reveals
the
alcohol
but
the
flavor
stays
consistent
this
is
a
great
strong
ale
bold
malt
and
hops
are
strong
without
being
too
aggressive
this
is
my
first
glbc
brew
and
i
dig
it
poured
about
a
ruby
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
held
up
ok
overall
looked
nice
not
much
to
the
aroma
it
was
gentle
a
little
bit
malty
the
taste
didnt
meet
my
hopes
for
it
a
little
banana
maybe
but
mostly
bitter
hops
that
lingered
not
much
in
the
sweet
and
malty
department
it
was
nicely
carbonated
and
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
but
overall
something
had
me
weirded
out
to
the
point
that
i
was
disappointed
and
didnt
really
see
myself
going
back
to
it
unless
it
was
to
make
sure
that
being
past
the
freshness
date
didnt
ruin
it
oh
well
bottle
picked
up
at
capones
in
pa
havent
had
this
in
a
while
since
great
lakes
stopped
distribution
into
indiana
pours
beautifully
crimson
and
clear
with
a
white
head
and
super
sticky
lacing
sweet
robitussin
hop
and
caramelsugar
odor
taste
is
very
bitter
and
hoppy
some
sweet
demerera
and
alcohol
tastes
imo
very
much
like
arrogant
bastard
hoppiness
lingers
extremely
syrupy
and
full
bodied
a
nice
big
bold
hopped
up
ale
get
it
if
you
see
it
a
great
beer
to
drink
while
watching
and
evening
with
kevin
smith
the
taste
hardly
masks
the
8
abv
and
alcohol
notes
pull
through
as
it
warms
not
a
detriment
to
the
ale
but
other
flavors
malt
and
vanilla
seem
to
be
overpowered
hops
is
big
on
the
palate
and
finishes
through
strong
as
well
like
the
vampire
on
the
bottle
cover
it
has
a
huge
hops
bite
yet
it
is
appealingly
dry
and
smooth
a
bit
too
dry
perhaps
for
me
yes
which
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
i
cant
imagine
going
through
more
than
one
bottle
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
could
get
dangerous
given
that
the
8
is
well
hidden
by
the
depth
of
flavor
drinkability
this
is
excellent
ale
but
the
high
abv
holds
down
sessionability
mouthfeel
bold
and
strong
in
its
different
flavors
nice
and
complex
and
warming
the
pour
into
my
grimbergen
glass
raises
a
creamy
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
glass
ring
with
pretty
thick
lacing
the
beers
body
is
a
bright
golden
red
the
nose
smells
a
lot
like
arrogant
bastard
but
with
less
caramel
sweetness
definite
pine
tar
odor
with
a
bit
of
citrus
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
very
fruity
with
a
candy
apple
flavor
the
hop
flavor
is
muted
and
theres
not
too
much
bitterness
just
an
underlying
pineyness
not
too
sweet
though
theres
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
in
check
the
mouth
is
medium
with
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
a
nice
strong
one
but
not
too
special
drinkability
is
ok
the
bitterness
feels
a
little
too
high
would
probably
be
great
with
a
little
time
drinkability
this
beer
is
amazing
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
is

hey
im
not

kid
anymore
and
drinking
multiple
beers
at
8
wont
work
well
with
getting
up
at
5
am
the
next
day
so
while
this
is
a
good
brew
this
is
not
a
session
beer
bought
a
case
to
have
through
october
poured
in
to
a
snifter
nice
copper
red
color
the
smell
was
hoppy
with
a
citrus
malt
tone
i
had
an
aroma
that
was
quite
different
but
very
tempting
the
beer
was
not
cloudy
at
all
but
deep
in
color
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
you
taste
that
this
is
a
higher
alchohol
beer
nice
bitter
tone
highly
reccomended
i
also
had
it
from
the
tap
which
was
very
good
the
restaurant
i
was
in
was
pretty
dark
so
it
was
hard
to
really
judge
the
appearance
of
the
beer
but
it
looked
good
to
me
the
smell
was
good
could
def
small
the
hops
and
some
other
spices
mixed
in
the
taste
was
strong
in
hops
which
i
really
dont
like
at
all
but
ill
have
to
say
its
much
better
than
say
an
extremely
hoppy
beer
i
could
at
least
drink
one
of
these
again

theres

as

to
start

end

remains
bitter
reminds
me
of
an

d

reminds
me
of
an

maybe
a
cross

them

some

big
juicy

flavor
at
first
with
an
unmistakeable

sharpness
all
around

this
yields
to
a

mellow

acidity
and
an
earthy
mineral
twang
at
the
finish
slight
alcohol
slickness
in
the

dry
tannic

that
lingers
as
a
sticky
bittersweet

a
very

ale
not
nearly
as
rough
around
the
edges
as
some
of
its
west
coast
counterparts
yet
still
bearing
many
family
resemblances
just
a
bit
more
refined

well
this
latest
from
great
lakes
was
heavily
anticipated
it
poured
a
copper
amber
color
and
formed
an
off
white
foamy
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
wonder
aroma
to
it
with
elements
of
pine
citrus
and
a
candy
sweetness
of
a
malt
background
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
with
some
caramel
elements
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
present
the
finish
was
a
bit
astrigent
and
bitter
another
fine
concoction
from
the
boys
on
the
lake
dark
copper
body
slightly
hazy
topped
by
a
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
of
strong
pine
citrus
and
florals
mixed
with
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
instantaneously
simultaneously
sweet
and
bitter
with
malt
sweetness
up
front
being
crowded
by
a
piney
resinous
bite
more
citrus
flavors
are
revealed
in
the
mid
along
with
a
decent
caramel
note
nice
strong
bitterness
on
the
finish
cleans
the
malt
away
fairly
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
almost
syrupy
but
not
to
the
point
that
it
makes
drinking
the
beer
laborious
on
the
contrary
drinking
this
beer
is
so
easy
that
a
couple
will
disappear
quickly
the
combination
of
intense
sweetness
and
hardhitting
hop
bitterness
is
a
true
joy
brian
and
the
crew
at
glbc
should
make
this
more
often
on
my
visit
to
glb
see
beerfly
review
i
had
the
utmost
pleasure
of
drinking
this
ultrahoppy
tart
ale
it
came
to
me
a
lovely
dark
amber
and
i
could
smell
the
hops
wafting
over
all
the
other
enticing
aromas
at
the
table
there
was
an
edmund
fitzgerald
porter
across
the
way
and
a
burning
river
pale
ale
next
to
me
i
confess
i
didnt
tarry
too
long
on
the
aroma
because
i
wanted
to
taste
and
it
did
not
disappoint
like
the
dogfish
head
60
minute
ipa
i
could
almost
believe
there
was
grapefruit
in
this
but
in
a
balanced
way
as
the
subtle
malt
sweetness
supported
the
bitternesswell
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
thick
but
the
hops
oh
the
hops
overall
this
beer
was
very
good
from
the
growler
although
the
carbonation
was
quickly
waning
one
with
a
ceramic
type
lid
likely
would
have
helped
i
suspect
nosferatu
would
be
exceptional
freshly
released
from
the
keg
at
great
lakes
and
i
strongly
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
sample
it
there
reddish
gold
color
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
only
on
draught
highly
hopped
but
the
firm
malt
background
comes
through
to
make
this
a
very
good
brew
might
be
the
best
red
ale
ive
had
very
flavorful
kind
of
has
a
sweet
almost
fruity
taste

being

family
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
an
off
batch
instead
of
a
crisp
hoppy
flavor
i
get
an
almost
soapy
and
flat
taste
enjoyed
the
other
lakefront
brews
from
the

so
i
may
have
to
try
this

alone

an

i
might
be
abnormally
high
on
it
because
i
tasted
it
directly
from

nevertheless
a
great

definitely
recommend
another

i
actually
am

this
it
feels
like
a
tasty
throwback
to
the
early
days
of
microbrews
in
the
late
90searly
2000s
o
a
decent
red
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
i
had
this
beer
a
while
back
on
tap
and
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
a
lot
more
than
i
did
today
not
bad
overall
very
easy
drinking
but
with
a
good
level
of
flavor
and
complexity
a
rather
nice
red
overall
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
amber
colored
even
though
it
really
is
a
red
ale
who
cares
right
the
beer
had
a
tan
head
and
the
beer
had
a
great
smell
of
vanilla
the
beer
was
nice
and
clean
tasting
with
a
very
faint
vanilla
taste
on
the
initial
hit
i
think
i
will
give
this
beer
another
shot
sharp
beginning
with
spicy
earthy
hops
and
notes
of
grapefruit
pith
and
orange
rind
very
dank
but
semidry
toasty
roast
gets
a
lot
of
attention
as
it
passes
across
the
palate
like
bitter
grit
flowery
tea
infusion
notes
are
interesting
but
somewhat
harsh
in
position
theres
a
clunky
alcohol
presence
that
kind
be
tasted
finishes
with
spicy
bitterness
and
a
second
burst
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
airy
and
of
the
crushing
kind
the
body
travels
at
a
medium
speed
but
features
all
kinds
of
texture
drinkability
is
about
a
c
to
a
b
fixed
gear
is
not
a
red
ale
id
scoff
at
nor
one
that
i
would
recommend
overall
i
like
this
beer
more
and
more
with
each
subsequent
sip
well
balanced
with
lots
of
flavor

offering
this
is
obviously
a
hybrid
style
which
leaves
more
room
for
creativity
without
a
need
to
criticize
for
authenticity
i
can
only
say
it
is
an
enjoyable
hop
heavy
beer
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
its
a
nice
reddish
orange
with
a
quarter
inch
head
that
hangs
around
nice
lacing
also
malts
are
in
the
forefront
of
the
nose
has
a
candy
malt
smell
actually
i
like
the
fact
that
hops
are
intertwined
with
the
malts
in
its
taste
the
malts
definitely
hit
the
tongue
first
but
with
a
sudden
instance
the
hops
reveal
themselves
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
will
visit
this
again
as
i
like
hops
and
in
my
opinon
this
is
a
hoppy
red
ale
not
overdone
with
hops
but
nicely
done
pretty
impressive
for
almost
a
macro
this
is
the
best
ive
had
from
lakefront
this
is
everywhere
but
ive
somehow
missed
it
a
hoppy
red
ale
that
drinks
a
little
heavier
than
most
hazy
amber
in
color
with
an
oatmeal
colored
head
with
excellent
lace
and
retention
the
nose
here
is
hop
forward
bitter
and
rich
from
the
grain
the
alcohol
content
is
also
somewhat
of
a
surprise
being
as
robust
as
it
is
for
a
release
like
this
maybe
i
had
the
wrong
opinion
about
these
guys
their
pumpkin
is
clearly
a
poor
judge
of
what
they
are
capable
of
nice
richness
of
feel
as
the
hops
provide
most
of
the
flavoring
and
the
malt
more
of
the
structure
a
little
dryer
than
expected
too
i
like
the
low
sugars
on
the
finish
and
the
lasting
bitterness
woody
almost
quite
good
really
fuller
body
a
sixer
might
be
too
big
of
a
dose
honestly
relatively
impressed
and
will
look
forward
to
more
lakefront
stuff
when
it
comes
around
i
wont
wait
so
long
next
time
o
as
this
is
a
local
brewery
for
me
i
continue
to
go
back
to
this
one
it
is
a
goto
beer
because
of
great
availability
price
and
taste
enjoy
this
one
hoppy
beers
with
a
malty
backbone
almost
always
sit
well
with
me
this
one
didnt
disappoint
great
head
retention
and
substantial
lacing
on
the
glass
very
hazy
and
deep
amber
color
the
smell
is
good
and
i
pick
up
some
grapefruit
but
for
a
beer
thats
supposedly
heavily
dry
hopped
there
isnt
much
there
maybe
the
keg
isnt
as
fresh
as
it
should
be
however
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
with
a
very
bold
dose
of
crystal
malt
without
going
overboard
layered
with
grapefruit
and
some
spicey
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
silky
there
is
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
in
this
one
but
i
think
it
goes
well
with
the
flavors
overall
id
definitely
have
this
one
again
sometime
and
would
recommend
it
to
any
hop
heads
who
like
some
balance

is

othis
is
a

of
the
style
it
is
not
going
to
blow
anyones
mind
but
it
provides
a
good
bit
of
flavor
in
a
very
drinkable
package
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
packs
nearly
7
abv
because
it
doesnt
taste
it
at
all
a
nice
beer
for
quaffing
on
a
cool

when
i
dont
want
to
think
about
things
too
much
ok
another
random
pick
from

looks

took
a

and
got
punched
in
the
mouth
with

hate
it
just
another

really
is
this
the
only
standard
for
american
microbrews
go
hop
heavy
and
forget
anything
else
if
youre
a
hophead
this
beer
is
for
you
otherwise
look
elsewhere
this
is
a
solid

ale

nothing

i

the

does

the

definitely
worth
it
nevertheless
this
is
an

favorite
styles
this
is
a
must
goto
from
now
on

and
definitely
a

i
tend

go
for
to
the
point
it
is
a
bold
red
ale
red
ale
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
would
buy
this
one
again
it
is
an
over
hopped
red
ale
and
if
you
did
a
blind
tasting
on
this
ale
you
would
guess
american
pale
ale
the
rest
a
pretty
good
beer
it
has
some
fairly
bold
flavors
but
still
has
good
drinkability
overall
i
am
not
too
disappointed
since
lakefront
really
does
make
rather
mediocre
beers
with
the
exception
of
the
winter
lager
i
am
puzzled
on
how
high
the
reviews
are
considering
this
beer
is
borderline
terrible
but
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
pours
a
bright
reddish
copper
hue
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and

everywhere
looks
very
enticing
for
a

and
finished
with
a

bitterness
and
overall
its
a
nice
representation
of
a
fine
red
ale
and
ill
be
back
for
another
one
thats
for
sure
sessionable
and
tasty
need
i
say
more
personally
i
dont
prefer
aggressively
hoppy
reds
though
this
is
by
no
means
a
beer
id
pour
out
it
would
be
better
if
it
found
a
better
balance
between
malt
and
hop
would
probably
not
buy
again
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
soapy
tan
head
on
top
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
lacing
as
well
as
a
pretty
strong
retention
as
well
the
smell
has
a
pretty
good
piney
aroma
with
some
toasted
malts
in
there
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
pretty
good
bitterness
to
it
along
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
a
decent
carbonation
and
dry
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
good
would
love
to
have
it
fresh
worth
trying
a
tasty
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
that
leans
toward
the
malty
side
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
hop
bombs
out
there

a
great

a
pretty
decent

ale
consistent
and
fairly

it
doesnt
really
give
a
lot
of
variance
on
the

its
pretty
good
for
whats
there
smooth
feel
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
not

shabby
but
not

memorable
either
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
citrusy
hops
and
caramel
malts
o
its
a
decent
beer
nothing
extraordinary
though
not
complex
whatsoever
and
you
cant
really
taste
the
malt
base
this
is
fantastic
everything
a
hoppy
red
ale
should
be
overall
i
may
have
had
this
one
a
little
too
cold
the
flavor
doesnt
live
up
to
the
interesting
aroma
but
i
wasnt
in
the
least
bit
disappointed
i
like
this
beer
there
are
other
hoppy
reds
and
amber
i
like
more
but
if
i
saw
this
on
tap
somewhere
i
would
order
a
pint
pours
a
murky

a
foamy

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
decent
amber
ale
something
apparently
much
more
common
south
of
the
border
where
they
arent
afraid
to
submit
to
the
whim
of
the
big
hops
and
we
are
ever
the
more
so
grateful
for
it
overall
a
pretty

orange
zest
and
buttery

throughout

the

brings
in
more
of
the

with
a

a

and
a

the

a
fairly
dry

12oz

that

leaves
some
spotty

aromas
are

tastes
are
a
heavy
dose
of
bready
caramel
malt
balanced
with
fresh
citric
hop
and
some
pine
that
lingers
on
the
finish
thinner
body
with
ample
carbonation
overall
a
nice
version
of
an
american
red
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
an
alright
beer
that
is
pretty
great
for
the
first
pint
slightly
hazy
copperamber
pour
with
a
tinge
of
red
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
crazy
lacing
huge
resiny
piney
malty
nose
with
hints
of
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
blood
orange
and
a
touch
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
just
as
bold
and
juicy
as
the
nose
hints
of
pine
resin
pink
grapefruit
blood
orange
toffee
caramel
sweet
bread
and
brown
sugar
the
balance
is
perfect
and
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
subtle
creaminess
along
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
probably
the
best
example
of
a
red
ale
ive
tasted
this
ale
is
red
duh
and
slightly
cloudy
with
1
12
inch
head
slightly
creamy
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
are
opposite
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
while
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
at
first
after
a
few
sips
the
malt
starts
to
show
up
a
bit
more
on
the
palate
overall
more
hoppy
and
less
malty
than
you
might
expect
from
a
red
ale
still
delicious
o
decent
this
grew
on
me
by
the
time
i
got
halfway
down
the
glass
i
paid
1
50
for
a
single
bottle
at
price
chopper
with
some
trepidation
after
my
fuel
cafe
experience
with
lakefront
i
got
a
solid
beer
at
that
price
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
somewhere
poured
from
a
355ml
bottle
pours
a
rusty
coppertawny
brown
barely
any
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
sweet
mix
of
brown
sugar
grainy
malt
and
a
little
spice
from
the
hops
the
brown
sugarmolasses
comes
through
on
the
palate
with
some
nutty
malt
marzipan
flavours
and
a
solid
hop
bite
at
the
back
end
of
the
finish
reminded
us
a
bit
of
lagunitas
brown
shugga
not
quite
as
good
as
3f
brian
boru
as
a
hoppedup
red
ale
but
in
the
same
zip
code
so
if
you
fancied
the
boru
seek
out
fixed
gear
as
a
yearround
alternative
thumbs
up
this
is
yet
another
satisfying
amberred
ale
with
a
solid
hop
profile
it
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
still
remains
quite
quaffable
d
very
drinkable
nice
balanced
red
ale
with
a
good
malt
and
hop
balance
and
a
nice
hop
profile
overall
in
truth
i
have
had
some
attempts
at
ipas
that
werent
as
good
as
lakefronts
amber
ale
so
i
guess
if
you
want
to
give
a
hoppy
amber
ale
a
try
then
this
beer
would
be
a
good
choice
and
really
the
hop
profile
in
this
amber
is
not
bad
dont
try
to
look
too
hard
for
the
biscuitlike
malts
in
this
beer
they
wont
be
there
overall
i
wouldnt
expect
the
beer
from
its
label
and
id
be
disappointed
if
i
were
looking
for
a
red
ale
somewhat
aggressively
hopped
for
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
o
has
a
good
deep
red
color
great
complexity
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
right
in
style
with
those
toasty
red
malts
a
little
bit
too
much
roastiness
stylistic
american
hops
good
full
body
this
body
fits
right
in
line
as
a
good
american
red
its
worth
mention
that
i
have
had
this
beer
in
my
fridge
and
should
have
tried
it
much
earlier
o
well
crafted
brew
that
im
glad
i
had
to
opportunity
to
try
o
id
pass
was
hoping
for
more
but
got
an
amber
that
was
heavier
than
my
meal
i
think
ill
pass
on
lakefront
for
now
note
i
really
like
this
beer
even
though
it
might
not
be
complex
or
anything
notes
very
good
and
quite
sessionable
cheers
overall
despite
that
the
bottle
says
it
tastes
damn
good

overall
an

almost
an

amber
if
such
a
style
exists
needs
more
spiice
and
malts
for
a
winter
warmer
otherwise
a
tasty
brew
this
beer
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
red
perhaps
an
imperial
pale
its
very
drinkable
and
quite
good
and
makes
a
good
session
brew
if
you
dont
mind
a
little
buzz
light
and
sweet
and
awfully
german
for
the
style
not
a
winter
warmer
in
my
book
too
light
on
the
malt
an
almost
golden
brew
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
an
impressive
aroma
of
german
hops
and
honey
sweetness
the
flavor
matches
well
its
balanced
but
easily
malt
forward
not
spiced
like
so
many
are
but
warming
in
an
alcoholic
sense
and
for
the
fact
that
this
is
not
particularly
drinkable
and
improves
with
temperature
unfolds
if
you
will
like
origami
really
works
for
what
it
is
but
it
is
not
a
conventional
winter
warmer
about
what
i
would
expect
from
big
sky
quintessentially
montana
big
and
bold
unique
but
conservatively
decent
a
good
match
with
february
less
so
with
november
but
it
was
cold
tonight
and
it
did
it
well
enough
for
me
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
got
buried
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
somehow
over
the
winter
unburied
it
last
night
it
seemed
almost
like
an
ipa
with
the
floral
hops
and
hints
of
orange
lemon
and
tangerine
theres
a
caramelsweet
edge
to
it
it
goes
down
really
easily
ironically
fit
my
hot
summer
night
really
well
maybe
next
time
ill
get
to
try
it
on
a
cold
winter
night
wellmade
brew
the
verdict
i
like
it
instead
of
the
typical
winter
warmer
this
is
more
like
sierra
nevadas
celebration
not
nearly
as
good
but
similar
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
good
flavor
poured
this
amber
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
amber
color
produced
a
nice
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
it
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
caramel
and
lemongrass
medium
in
body
this
ale
had
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
sweet
caramel
and
some
citric
lemon
hops
somewhat
bitter
dry
finish
overall
not
very
flavorful
its
decent
for
a
session
beer
but
for
a
winter
ale
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
umph
yet
another
solidly
crafted
and
enjoyable
offering
from
the
most
consistent
brewery
i
know
winter
ales
for
me
can
be
very
hit
and
miss
so
glad
this
is
an
american
amber
without
the
spices
so
should
be
interesting
and
pours
a
clear
amber
hue
with
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
carameltoffeedried
fruita
hint
of
raisins
and
fruity
hops
in
the
backgroundthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
toffeecandymarzipan
the
slightest
hit
of
piney
resinous
hops
followed
by
a
nice
citrus
bitterness
and
overall
i
like
this
as
a
winter
ale
and
as
the
old
saying
goes
less
is
best
definately
applies
in
this
casea
very
drinkable
amber
do
they
have
skiing
teams
in
the
big
sky
conference
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
very
light
grapefruit
peel
mixed
greens
light
honeydripped
biscuit
and
very
light
toffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
more
greens
a
touch
more
sweetness
for
the
honey
and
biscuit
and
an
added
hint
of

the

is
a
light

with
a

overall
an
alright
if
thoroughly
nondescript
little
beer
ahmen
ahmen
i
shouted

this
beer
is
excellent
it
even
has
a
nice
scene
with
a
husky
and
some
snow
on
the
label
belltown
is
were
i
found
it
jus
a
single
but
would
definetly
get
a
sixer
floral
smooth
not
too
spicy
goes
down
great
overall
received
a
few
bottles
as
a
gift
i
think
they
may
be
a
little
old
but
reviewed
anyway
this
beer
reminded
me
why
i
usually
avoid
amber
ales
and
winter
ales
unless
they
are
highly
recommended
an
uninspiring
mix
of
fruit
and
toffee
flavors
at
least
it
didnt
have
metallic
hop
flavors
like
my
least
favorite
redamber
ales
o
again
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
too
aggressive
but
presents
itself
enough
to
make
its
flavors
know
while
perhaps
not
a
traditional
winter
ale
still
very
enjoyable
eh
i
wasnt
really
feeling
this
one
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
very
good
either
a
little
to
unbalanced
with
the
malt
in
my
opinion
and
the
sweetness
just
wasnt
controlled
or
able
to
stand
all
on
its
own
decent
but
certainly
nothing
special
overall
for
a
7
2
i
can
hang
with
this
one
it
does
appear
the
hops
in
american
beer
is
to
hide
the
abv
and
make
it
easier
to
drink
but
this
one
hasa
decent
balance
of
piney
to
abv
that
i
can
handle
o
powder
hound
has
a
beautifully
painted
label
that
evokes
strong
outdoorsy
feelings
of
winter
in
the
northwoods
for
me
but
thats
about
where
the
winter
character
of
this
beer
stops
it
seems
to
me
more
of
a
higher
octane
amber
with
a
nice
little
hop
push
and
solid
malt
body
suitable
for
tailgating
during
those
cold
winter
games
overall
too
bad
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
match
up
with
the
rest
of
the
qualities
this
beer
presents
otherwise
this
thing
could
be
a
monster
of
a
winter
release
its
just
missing
one
thing
that
would
really
set
it
off
maybe
if
it
popped
a
bit
more
on
toasted
notes
a
pinch
more
chocolate
malt
maybe
in
any
event
its
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
amber
ale
and
the
balance
was
pretty
nice
this
beer
had
very
good
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
crisp
a
little
refreshing
and
it
had
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
its
a
pretty
easy
drinking
red
ale
and
i
like
that
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
it
was
very
good
and
better
then
most
amber
ales
and
it
also
hid
its
alcohol
very
nicely
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
sweet
it
smelled
it
had
me
preparing
for
the
worse
but
luckily
all
that
sweetness
didnt
make
it
to
the
taste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
to
keep
around
in
the
fridge
since
i
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
its
always
nice
to
have
a
quality
easy
drinking
amber
ale
on
hand
i
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
fans
of
the
style
should
really
appreciate
it
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
very
solid
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
last
couple
big
sky
beers
i
had
werent
too
impressive
so
its
nice
to
get
one
that
i
enjoy
my
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
i
think
its
miss
marketed
i
dont
really
think
of
this
as
winter
ale
it
has
that
nice
amber
ale
flavor
that
is
perfect
for
the
summer
and
fall
and
i
think
this
beer
would
do
much
better
if
marketed
as
a
year
round
amber
ale
instead
of
a
winter
ale
but
thats
just
my
opinion
either
was
this
was
pretty
solid
and
im
happy
i
tried
it
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
after
it
poured
out
from
the
bottle
with
a
decent
head
it
lost
all
head
quickly
i
also
had
trouble
placing
the
amarillo
hops
which
i
generally
love
still
there
were
overall
good
flavors
involved
i
liked
it
enough
to
try
another
bottle
to
see
if
that
holds
carbonation
more
poured
out
a
darker
amber
with
decent
clarity
two
fingers
of
foamy
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
minute
and
a
half
with
medium
levels
of
lacing
left
behind
smells
like
an
even
blend
of
citrus
peel
chocolate
malt
and
a
garnish
of
vanilla
on
top
tastes
has
a
gentle
toasted
nut
and
vanilla
character
combined
with
a
citrus
earthy
hopping
garnish
noticeably
absent
is
any
kind
of
holiday
spicing
for
better
or
for
worse
feels
thicker
in
flavor
than
the
body
actually
is
gently
carbonated
and
creamy
in
texture
o
tastes
like
an
ipa
called
a
winter
ale
categorized
here
a
red
ale
i
dont
know
what
the
right
answer
is
but
i
do
know
this
is
a
very
tasty
treat
that
i
will
keep
going
back
to
while
visiting
montana
nice
drinkable
hoppy
beer
wouldnt
be
complaining
if
there
were
more
but
its
still
decently
put
together
o
its
a
decent
albeit
unremarkable
beer
overall
an
above
average
ale
more
floral
than
others
ive
had
and
also
for
a
winter
beer
much
better
than
others
overall
a
pretty
nice
hoppy
american
amber
ale
its
smooth
and
the
malt
is
perhaps
a
little
less
pronounced
than
it
could
be
but
its
a
good
if
somewhat
middleoftheroad
example
of
the
style
o
a
decent
amber
winter
warmer
though
the
bitterness
isnt
particularly
desirable
in
this
case
the
powder
hound
is
a
beautiful
beer
poured
a
clear
perfect
amber
with
slighly
off
white
head
that
is
at
least
a
half
finger
and
is
lacing
really
well
the
smell
is
a
good
heavy
carmal
malt
with
tinges
of
spice
the
initial
taste
was
an
alcohol
explosion
the
second
taste
allowed
for
the
malt
and
carmel
to
begin
to
blossum
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
not
masked
as
well
as
i
would
like
12
ounce
bottle

some

clings
to
the

of
caramel

only
a

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
amber
ale
nice
hoppy
and
spicy
flavor
with
good
malt
balance
o
a
decent
beer
though
nothing
special
id
like
a
bit
more
hop
presence
in
the
nose
and
flavor
overall
a
nice
bold
winter
ale
that
had
just
the
right
amount
of
spices
and
a
great
hoppy
finish
i
got
more
of
an
american
strong
ale
impression
from
this
beer
rather
than
a
amberred
due
to
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
twinge
i
did
enjoy
the
balance
it
provided
and
would
purchase
again
pours

of

and
a

the

tastes
of

hint

slight
citrus
hops
hint
of
earthy

and
a
hint
of
caramel

overall
good
appearance
body
complexity
and
blend
overall
nice
ale
overall
that
does
not
seem
to
fit
any
known
style
kind
of
an
english
strong
ale
kind
of
an
amber
ale
kind
of
a
spiced
winter
warmer
despite
the
lack
of
spices
this
seriously
confuses
the
hell
out
of
me
but
if
i
put
my
beer
reviewing
hat
away
it
is
clear
that
i
really
enjoy
it
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
o
i
feel
this
brew
is
worth
trying
for
sure
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
medium
hop
intensity
overall
i
feel
it
was
a
decent
winter
beer
but
was
lacking
in
certain
areas
to
make
it
a
great
beer
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
expect
it
to
become
anyones
favorite
overall
i
got
this
beer
as
an
extra
so
i
am
thrilled
about
it
its
really
good
and
i
recommend
trying
it
its
a
more
simple
than
youd
think
highgravity
chugger
sometimes
its
what
a
brewer
doesnt
do
that
factors
in
more
than
what
they
did
and
they
didnt
broadcast
strength
in
particular
here
wouldnt
fight
anybody
over
it
but
it
works
if
powder
hound
were
a
snowfall
it
would
be
about
four
inches
not
too
deep
but
enough
to
enjoy
a
wellbalanced
drinkable
amber
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
a
somewhat
different
style
of
winter
brew
a
welcome
change
overall
like
i
said
before
its
really
just
a
spicy
amber
ale
not
bad
though
another
nononsense
winter
ale
just
a
decently
crafted
strong
version
of
a
traditional
style
and
i
really
love
the
folk
art
label
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
paintings
my
grandmother
used
to
make
o
overall
good
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
boozey
bite
to
help
fight
off
winter
cold
blahs
and
bring
in
the
holidays
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
i
like
that
theyre
going
for
something
other
than
a
spicy
winter
ale
though
yeah
this
is
pretty
good
beer
after
one
glass
im
still
not
sure
exactly
what
to
think
would
i
want
this
on
tap
at
the
house
sure
but
im
not
sure
i
would
pick
up
another
six
pack
with
all
the
other
winter
selections
out
there
several
would
go
down
easy
whilst
standing
around
the
smoker
on
a
snowy
afternoon
but
i
wouldnt
count
on
it
to
get
me
through
a
january
night
in
montana
m
smooth
clean
low
carbonation
mediumfull
body
very
drinkable
fairly
high
abv
for
this
style
but
the
booze
barely
shows
awesome
example
of
the
style
and
perfect
balance
of
malt
to
hops
for
the
season
the
mouthfeel
is
fluff
totally
like
that
fake
snow
stuff
that
they
use
in
diapers
o
man
i
dont
want
it
to
appear
that
i
dont
like
this
beer
because
its
good
but
to
style
as
a
winter
amberred
this
is
more
of
a
hoppy
red
wouldnt
have
it
be
my
winter
seasonal
if
i
was
big
sky
that
being
said
and
im
a
hophead
i
do
enjoy
it
really
a
better
beer
for
fall
or
spring
than
winter
unless
you
need
a
break
from
big
ass
beers
feels
medium
to
full
in
body
good
carbonation
as
well
as
wetting
to
the
palate
for
a
higher
abv
brew
there
is
little
to
no
alcohol
burn
which
is
always
a
plus
in
my
book
o
meh
okay
sessionable
would
drink
if
already
drunk
really
unobtrusive
overall
i
rated
this
2
63
the
last
time
i
had
it
but
i
think
its
really
good
this
time
d
the
balance
is
way
off
in
this
beer
the
aroma
doesnt
match
the
flavor
and
the
entire
thing
is
off
kilter
its
not
bad
but
something
is
way
off
with
this
one
o
there
isnt
anything
about
this
beer
that
is
remarkable
but
it
is
solid
in
almost
every
way
the
appearance
could
use
some
work
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
quintessential
example
of
an
amber
ale
nice
hop
profile
toasted
malts
slight
fruitiness
look
no
further
if
youre
searching
for
a
solid
amber
well
done
big
sky
great
beer
that
is
worth
having
a
few
time
throughout
the
year
aroma
was
full
of
hops
creating
a
large
sweet
aroma
thick
malted
backbone
that
was
full
of
deep
earthen
grains
and
roasted
malts
and
a
nice
caramel
coating
that
seemed
to
tie
it
all
together
very
nicely
resin
pine
with
a
sugary
caramel
sweetness
balancing
it
very
nicely
the
backbone
being
the
roasted
malts
consisting
of
a
nice
spattering
of
cereal
grain
and
earthy
grasses
all
of
this
seamlessly
blended
together
in
a
thick
mix
of
almost
chewy
goodness
i
wanted
to
like
powder
hound
more
than
i
did
i
love
winter
warmers
and
big
sky
brews
quality
beers
but
this
one
you
can
pass
on
for
all
but
the
coldest
of
nights
a
peculiar
but
good
beer
it
has
a
certain
twang
to
it
i
could
swear
that
this
an
attempt
at
an
imperial
pilsener
i
think
what
i
enjoy
most
about
powder
hound
is
the
mouthfeel
and
balance
of
flavor
hops
are
most
prevalent
but
there
isnt
too
much
bitterness
its
very
nice
though
instead
it
has
a
more
earthyspicy
flavor
thats
not
overwhelming
mango
citrus
tang
follows
the
hops
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
light
roastiness
when
drinking
this
i
think
of
sitting
by
a
fire
after
being
outside
in
the
cold
and
snow
in
this
case
i
guess
the
powder
hound
has
done
its
job
of
being
a
winter
ale
since
it
makes
me
imagine
drinking
it
in
the
winter
p
hop
bitterness
and
citrus
do
linger
at
the
very
end
in
the
mouth
theres
nothing
like
good
flavors
lingering
to
help
you
have
a
more
lasting
enjoyment
of
the
beer
although
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
extraordinary
it
is
definitely
very
good
its
a
great
example
of
a
quintessential
winter
ale
if
youre
snowed
in
then
get
this
one
appears
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
little
lace
i
can
smell
the
maltiness
immediately
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
and
some
spicy
notes
detected
as
well
it
tastes
as
it
smells
this
brew
is
crisp
but
gets
syrupy
as
it
warms
dry
finish
and
is
medium
bodied
while
cold
but
thickens
warm
low
carbonation
this
ale
is
perhaps
a
little
above
average
but
not
great
d
a
very
tasty
amber
ale
i
really
enjoyed
many
of
the
amber
ales
i
indulged
while
visiting
montana
as
many
struck
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
easily
sessionable
thanks
sholle
for
the
opportunity
overall
id
been
avoiding
this
one
as
i
thought
it
was
a
winter
warmer
style
but
its
not
glad
i
finally
tried
it
as
it
greatly
surprised
me
with
its
rich
aroma
and
flavor
highly
recommend
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
its
an
octjan
seasonal
worth
a
6
pack
spread
out
over
that
time
for
sure
r
y
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
could
easily
drink
several
before
the
7
2
abv
caught
up
with
me
gracias
to
my
nephew
chad
who
introduced
me
to
this
beer
beautiful
looking
deep
rubybrown
with
light
tan
head
spicy
aroma
with
a
nuttiness
and
notes
of
clove
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
nose
but
did
have
a
nice
hoppy
finish
guessing
noble
hops
thick
rich
mouthfeel
and
a
good
brew
overall
certainly
on
spot
for
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
as
just
a
good
tasting
beer
but
not
sure
it
qualifies
as
a
winter
warmer
lots
of
flavor
but
on
the
light
side
rather
than
full
bodied
and
while
it
is
spicy
i
dont
usually
associate
pepper
as
a
winter
spice
whatever
it
is
it
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
big
skys
version
of
a
winter
ale
enters
the
glass
revealing
an
amber
colored
liquid
with
a
dishwater
head
the
color
is
lighter
than
i
expect
for
a
winter
aleportentous
it
seems
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mixture
of
caramel
malt
biscuit
and
citrus
and
pine
from
the
hops
as
i
take
the
first
imbibition
hops
race
across
the
palate
making
this
beer
feel
more
akin
to
a
pale
ale
than
a
winter
ale
the
pine
and
citrus
from
the
hops
is
not
able
to
overpower
the
caramel
and
nuttiness
from
the
malt
the
interplay
between
the
hops
and
malt
is
just
right
this
well
balanced
brew
is
a
winter
delight
drinkable
indeed
mouthfeeldrinkability
pretty
light
on
body
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
not
overly
impressive
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
fairly
unique
to
me
for
the
style
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
solid
offering
from
big
sky
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
definitely
worth
a
try
d
i
like
it
but
i
cant
get
over
the
idea
of
a
winter
ale
its
good
but
not
winter
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
winter
warmer
i
could
drink
these
fairly
often
if
they
didnt
sell
out
so
quickly
i
think
ill
make
it
a
habit
of
drinking
powder
hound
every
winter
d
it
came
across
as
an
amber
thats
had
everything
ratcheted
up
a
notch
very
flavorful
as
a
winter
seasonal
its
a
nice
seitch
from
some
of
the
overlyspiced
alcohol
bombs
out
there
at
first
i
thought
this
would
be
some
kind
of
a
sessionable
seasonal
however
it
ended
up
a
little
too
bold
for
a
bunch
in
any
one
sitting
not
really
a
sipper
but
definitely
not
a
chugger
overall
this
is
a
decent
little
beer
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
when
i
opened
the
beer
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
it
was
a
surprise
to
see
a
lighter
colored
amber
ale
but
the
beer
was
still
enjoyable
dont
let
the
color
fool
you
this
one
has
plenty
of
gusto
the
body
is
pretty
thick
with
a
nice
stickiness
carbonation
is
crisp
from
start
to
finish
and
the
lingering
dry
bitterness
keeps
me
sipping
the
7
abv
is
evident
but
totally
acceptable
it
adds
the
extra
warmth
that
elevates
this
beer
to
the
next
level
the
style
it
falls
into
could
be
highly
controversial
but
forget
where
it
fits
and
enjoy
over
all
it
is
a
good
buy
i
would
not
want
to
drink
these
in
quantity
or
really
with
a
nice
dinner
but
with
a
nice
big
steak
or
a
piece
of
blackened
salmon
something
with
alot
of
flavor
to
stand
up
to
it
would
be
a
well
suited
pairing
d
solid
winter
beer
definitely
more
in
the
celebration
realm
for
winter
beers
tasty
but
nothing
more
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
balanced
hoppy
spicy
and
a
great
after
taste
drinkability
tasty
stuff
another
decent
holiday
warmer
too
bad
it
cant
cure
my
cold
drinkability
might
be
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
enjoy
on
many
occasions
but
id
keep
coming
back
just
for
the
complexity
of
it
nice
brew
d
a
simple
beer
that
drinks
alright
but
is
quickly
forgotten
a
little
different
than
what
i
expected
from
a
winter
ale
it
seems
to
fit
the
profile
of
a
pale
ale
or
maybe
even
an
ipa
with
the
hop
domination
even
still
its
a
satisfying
and
tasty
treat

notes
an
american
amber
made
with
british
hops
not
sure
what
technical
category
to
put
it
in
but
it
is
a
great
hoppy
amber
esb
maybe
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
a
good
winter
warmer
the
ale
pours
a
light
reddish
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
kind
of
nuttysmokey
it
also
smells
a
bit
like
orange
peels
there
is
also
a
slight
herbal
fragrance
to
the
ale
it
tastes
of
rich
roasted
malts
the
ones
that
add
a
slightly
bitter
smokey
quality
to
beer
the
beer
has
a
noticeable
amount
of
hops
the
hops
mostly
add
to
the
bitterness
but
there
is
a
slight
citrus
flavor
to
them
as
well
the
malts
and
hops
blend
nicely
with
no
element
really
overpowering
the
other
the
carbonation
which
was
low
helped
the
flavors
blend
together
it
is
an
excellent
wintertime
beer
the
color
when
poured
in
a
glass
was
of
a
medium
dark
amber
nice
medium
very
light
tan
foam
with
a
nice
amount
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
light
hops
witha
hint
of
roasted
malts
filled
the
nose
with
a
nice
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
of
light
hops
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
citrus
was
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
thats
not
overpowering
on
a
hoppy
flavor
not
overly
bitter
just
a
please
feel
in
the
mouth
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
recedes
to
an
ok
film
of
foam
nice
toasted
bread
and
grain
aroma
with
some
light
grass
hops
in
the
nose
the
starts
with
an
oily
malt
of
bread
and
some
cooking
oil
the
middle
mellows
the
oilyness
on
the
palate
as
the
beer
warms
the
palate
becomes
more
grainy
and
malty
pretty
nice
session
amber
ale
d
the
lightness
of
flavor
and
body
make
this
a
decent
session
beer
either
the
recipe
was
changed
or
the
beer
is
different
than
i
remember
or
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
one
is
a
medium
copper
with
some
floaty
sediment
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
citrus
the
taste
is
peculiar
its
hoppy
but
settles
to
a
somewhat
earthy
feel
with
a
peculiar
tartness
that
wouldnt
fade
the
body
seems
too
light
for
the
style
the
aftertaste
has
that
tartness
and
seems
a
tad
sour
im
not
impressed
with
this
release
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
if
this
were
that
style
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
winter
ale
not
quite
what
i
consider
a
winter
warmer
nor
a
strong
ale
but
very
mild
and
enjoyable
malt
flavor
is
balanced
with
a
nice
hop
presence
but
not
anything
like
the
hoppy
brews
i
lean
towards
ive
had
this
3
times
this
week
as
its
a
nice
every
day
brew
to
have
with
food
it
compliments
bbq
and
give
you
a
warm
feeling
without
the
big
alcohol
kick
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
i
find
so
many
amber
ales
to
be
kind
of
meh
and
this
one
follows
suit
drinkability
while
its
definitely
not
the
most
engaging
or
alluring
of
wintertime
offerings
it
is
fairly
acceptable
for
a
relatively
light
seasonal
offering
a
really
good
beer
big
sky
continues
to
impress
me

drink
several
in

session
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
all
in
all
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
beer
my
only
question
why
is
this
their
winter
ale
taste
is
pretty
good
with
a
wide
variety
of
maltiness
on
the
palate
grainy
toasty
nutty
and
even
a
bit
of
cocoa
decent
hop
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
bit
light
bodied
and
flavored
for
the
winter
ale
designation
on
the
label
especially
from
a
snowy
cold
northern
state
it
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
tastes
great
for
an
amber
ale
which
is
what
i
am
rating
it
as
i
would
drink
it
again
and
me
thinks
it
would
be
even
better
fresh
off
the
tap
overall
impression
the
bitterness
is
too
prominent
for
the
malt
back
bone
it
is
a
little
out
of
balance
the
malts
never
show
up
not
a
spiced
winter
brew
but
a
nice
malty
but
with
a
hop
balance
and
a
hint
of
warmth
brew
could
see
how
it
fits
with
winter
with
the
days
getting
noticeably
longer
but
it
is
a
really
solidly
built
brew

update

the
2005
was
a
lot
maltier
than
years
before
they
really
are
working
on
this
recipe
the
flavor
is
grainy
but
beefy
malts
straight
3
5s
seems
to
be
this
beers
home
so
ill
leave
it
as
such
its
a
nice
ale
though
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
a
rich
copperred
with
a
thin
tan
head
smelled
like
malted
milk
balls
tastes
like
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
heavy
on
the
malty
sweetness
maybe
a
bit
of
nutmeg
in
there
as
well
they
didnt
overdo
it
one
the
spices
which
is
nice
not
much
hops
but
what
there
is
adds
a
pleasant
citrus
bitterness
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
went
especially
good
with
yam
yams
bbq
portland
or
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
winter
warmer
though
its
less
than
medium
bodied
and
less
than
worthwhile
as
a
winter
seasonal
or
any
seasonal
drinkability
extreme
drinkability
had
this
for
the
first
time
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
it
was
the
beer
i
most
crave
from
montana
awesome
beer
a
nice
dark
red
ale
with
a
fat
off
white
head
the
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
and
crystal
malts
the
flavor
is
a
bit
maltier
than
the
aroma
and
the
hops
come
on
strong
towards
the
end
i
was
going
to
rank
this
beer
a
bit
lower
but
as
i
sit
and
sip
this
brew
it
is
making
its
personality
known
and
i
am
growing
fond
of
it
it
is
not
as
strong
as
most
winter
brews
but
it
is
definitely
drinkable
its
a
great
winter
ale
would
be
refreshing
especially
with
a
hearty
winter
meal
nice
sweet
aroma
nice
malty
sweet
ale
hops
balance
perfectly
and
make
this
an
easy
drinking
tasty
winter
ale
solid
malt
base
a
good
solid
tasty
easy
drinking
ale
ruddy
bister
hue
topped
by
a
beige
head
that
recedes
into
a
lean
but
steadfast
layer
frothy
loose
lace
remains
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
mellow
cocoa
and
tepid
slightly
tart
lemon
like
citrus
floral
hints
arise
as
it
breathes
but
as
a
whole
the
aroma
is
understated
and
functional
at
best
the
flavor
is
a
facsimile
of
the
nose
mild
cocoa
and
citrus
are
prevalent
although
an
undertone
of
caramel
sweetened
dark
biscuit
adds
depth
hop
bitterness
is
paltry
and
leaves
ample
but
inobtrusive
residual
sweetness
virtually
bereft
of
esters
save
a
trace
figgish
complement
lightly
bodied
and
conducive
to
easy
quaffing
needs
more
dextrins
to
bolster
the
malt
backbone
finishes
squeaky
clean
with
only
a
ghostly
hint
of
roasted
barley
an
innocuous
well
crafted
albeit
unimaginative
brew
excellent
drinkability
limited
savorability
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
had
hopes
that
this
dog
had
a
little
more
bite
thanks
to
bighuge
for
the
sample
powder
hound
was
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
was
a
very
attractive
deep
rubyorange
and
was
topped
by
an
offwhite
head
that
left
very
nice
and
ornate
lacing
the
underpowering
nose
was
sweet
with
a
delicate
strawberry
maltiness
and
a
subtle
citric
hoppiness
the
taste
was
also
rather
bland
for
a
winter
beer
the
malt
character
was
quite
mild
and
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggested
with
no
roastiness
to
be
found
instead
a
belgian
strong
alelike
focused
strawberry
essence
presided
and
held
up
throughout
the
mild
bitter
finish
i
am
reminded
somewhat
of
a
wimpy
version
of
the
victory
grand
cru
my
conclusion
is
that
this
beer
is
an
experimental
variant
of
the
belgian
pale
strong
style
though
there
was
no
spice
perhaps
an
attempt
to
blend
this
style
with
another
altough
with
what
i
dont
know
maybe
with
an
amberred
ale
as
the
style
designation
suggests
or
an
english
pale
ale
the
result
is
not
very
inspiring
but
isnt
bad
just
bland
the
body
of
the
beer
is
decent
though
carbonation
seemed
fizzle
out
to
quickly
an
interesting
beer
but
fails
to
make
a
splash
this
is
moderately
drinkable
but
i
find
nothing
essential
about
it
especially
when
viewing
it
as
a
winter
brew
i
doubt
this
will
replace
anchors
osa
or
celebration
in
many
peoples
hearts
anytime
soon
a
sweet
malty
beer
good
for
keeping
out
the
winter
chill
darkish
redamber
with
small
dwindling
head
and
some
lace
malts
are
very
nice
warming
leathery
and
a
touch
smoky
lots
of
biscuit
sweetness
and
a
sweet
currant
fruitiness
that
slowly
becomes
apparant
lots
of
irish
red
ale
malt
character
too
hops
are
not
very
substantial
but
they
do
the
job
with
a
definite
herbal
character
a
long
lingering
sweetness
entices
you
to
take
another
sip
i
was
surprised
how
good
this
beer
was
it
at
first
seemed
like
an
average
malty
winter
brew
but
as
it
asserted
itself
i
was
more
and
more
impressed
with
its
complexity
this
beer
would
go
well
with
foods
maybe
smoky
meats
but
i
also
wonder
how
it
would
do
alongside
a
sweet
caramelized
dessert
it
tastes
a
little
like
the
burnt
top
of
a
creme
brulee
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
more
of
a
floral
smell
than
anything
else
i
am
getting
tastes
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
little
hops
finish
also
has
that
little
floral
hint
in
the
flavor
pretty
tasty
maybe
not
enough
intriguing
factors
to
be
considered
great
the
bottle
did
not
give
any
guidance
as
to
the
style
and
all
the
way
through
the
beer
i
kept
wondering
what
are
they
trying
to
accomplish
here
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
seemed
to
lack
direction
lightly
sweet
overall
with
some
bitterness
at
the
front
which
quickly
mellowed
i
couldnt
decide
if
this
winter
seasonal
was
an
amber
ale
or
a
very
very
mellow
old
ale
style
nice
but
not
much
oomph
for
a
winter
seasonal
super
nice
color
which
seems
dark
chestnut
brown
ahh
but
hold
it
to
the
light
and
it
becomes
a

a

this

quite

much
i
liked
this
ale
even
in
the
early
summer
pretty
drinkable
in
my
books
cheers
to
budgood
for
the
sample
this
is
another
great
brew
from
big
sky
the
powder
hound
had
a
really
inviting
look
with
a
dark
almost
garnet
like
color
and
a
two
finger
head
that
had
nice
retention
and
lace
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
slight
empahsis
on
the
malt
giving
it
a
toasty
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
overpowering
a
very
drinkable
brew
pours
a
deep
dark
auburn
with
a
thin
head
the
heavy
aroma
of
toffee
and
sweet
malt
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
favortie
british
ales
a
distinct
bitterness
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
palate
followed
quickly
by
heavy
deep
chocolate
and
toffee
flavor
fairly
smooth
body
supports
the
wellrounded
taste
very
much
like
sam
smiths
winter
brew
with
a
bit
more
solid
bitter
very
taste
and
worth
the
shipping
amber

the

also
present
in
the
finish
overall
a
decent
winter
brew
pours
a
clear
dark

with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
reveals
a
light
malt
and
wet
dog
aroma
must
be
the
hound
the
taste
is
a
toasty
bread
taste
with
mild
hops
and
finishes
with
an
alcohol
tastefortunately
no
hound
this
time
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
that
is
decent
at
best
it
is
not
highly
complex
and
not
extremely
appealing
thanks
nonetheless
to

a

very

im
a
fan
of
this
styleflavor
of
winter
brew
it
needs
some
backbone
but
the
malt
flavor
is
great
recommended
this
is
the
first
year
i
tried
this
one
beautiful
mohagony
color
great
malt
taste
very
good
this
beer
tastes
as
if
it
was
aged
in
oak
nice
warming
winter
brew
i
truly
cannot
make
up
my
mind
on
ambers
one
second
i
think
im
just
done
with
them
and
then
i
try
one
like
this
that
changes
my
mind
very
very
solid
brew
this
was
a
great
amber
and
i
never
say
that
just
not
my
style
and
i
was
required
to
write
something
mild
slightly
hopped
amber
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
are
present
taste
is
hops
up
front
malts
at
the
finish
a
touch
of
caramel
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
may
not
be
ground
shattering
but
is
a
very
good
selection
to
pair
with
food
and
is
extremely
drinkable
and
good
for
meeting
with
friends
and
shooting
the
breeze
incredible
beer
that
i
need
to
pick
up
and
give
a
deep
analysis
on
not
really
a
fan
of
highland
one
of
my
favorite
beers
best
from
the
tap
very
drinkable
and
foodfriendly
this
is
a
goto
red
ale
as
it
is
now
readily
available
in
my
area
stirs
up
a
craving
for
brats
or
sausage
sandwiches
i
keep
this
in
a
wine
cooler
at
50
degrees
and
the
flavors
and
subtle
complexities
really
come
out
at
that
temp
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beerthough
i
wouldnt
quite
call
it
sessionable
despite
its
fairly
light
body
it
was
decent

malty
but
this
beer
really
turned
me
on
to
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
head
that
retained
ok
and
left
some
lacing
the
aroma
had
notes
of
caramel
malt
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
quality
in
a
beer
the
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
though
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
thorpe429jun

but
it
surprisingly
didnt
have
the
taste
to
back
it
up
it
was
also
on
the
thin
side
for
me
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
based
on
what
i
had
heard
about
it

a
tasty
and
very
sessionable
beer
from
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
southeasts
better
craft
breweries

and
the
scent
was
weaker
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
one
finger
thick
white
head
a
few
splotches
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
smell
predominantly
toasted
grain
with
some
caramel
hopping
is
leafy
with
a
little
citrus
peel
taste
toasted
grain
caramel
kind
of
a
graham
cracker
thing
going
on
a
little
grapefruit
and
spicy
hopping
with
an
earthy
finish
medium
bodied
caramel
apple
and
earthiness
in
play
at
the
finish
nice
beer
balanced
for
pretty
much
any
season
tasty
and
well
made
thank
god
this
comes
in
a
sixpack
because
its
a
very
tasty
very
drinkable
beer
pours
out
a
nice
deep
amber
color
almost
ruby
the
head
is
about
23
fingers
but
doesnt
linger
long
with
traces
of
lace
the
nose
is
full
of
floral
aroma
and
sweet
like
honey
this
is
where
the
cascade
and
williamette
do
wonders
for
the
aroma
of
a
beer
the
taste
was
on
the
upper
bitter
end
for
an
amber
but
it
while
i
thought
it
was
well
balanced
with
the
malts
the
bitterness
lingered
a
little
too
long
a
tiny
hint
of
earthiness
spice
and
fruit
came
through
in
the
taste
making
it
a
nice
lightbodied
flavorful
semisweet
amber
with
character
id
say
while
its
drinkable
for
me
it
may
be
a
little
complex
for
those
seeking
a
session
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
unique
amber
definitely
give
this
beer
a
try
d
i
find
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
fancy
that
its
easy
to
down
before
you
realize
how
many
youve
had
very
strong
aged
taste
with
yeast
and
ginger
after
thoughts
i
cant
get
enough
somewhat
dry
but
totally
drinkable
good
beer
looks
like
nc
does
it
right
thank
you
cblack85
d
this
one
disappeared
quite
quickly
and
i
would
not
have
hesitated
to
have
another
were
it
available
overall
a
flavorful
yet
highly
drinkable
session
beer
thats
rightfully
the
flagship
of
highland
brewery
the
mouth
is
slick
and
well
suited
to
the
beer
it
is
an
easy
enough
drinker
served
a
bit
to
cold
but
it
improved
as
it
warms
pours
a
beautiful
deep
dark
red
color
with
medium
foamy
tan
head
aroma
is
very
caramel
sweet
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
flavor
to
me
is
lacking
of
course
i
was
told
it
was
a
brown
ale
and
i
didnt
believe
him
so
the
hops
now
make
sense
now
that
i
see
its
a
red
ale
some
sweet
caramel
some
bitter
hoppiness
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
overall
not
bad
but
im
glad
i
didnt
pull
the
trigger
and
trade
for
these
5
different
highlander
beers
i
just
got
for
free
from
a
friend
notes
excellent
light
american
amber
pours
out
a
nice
ruby
looking
amber
color
decent
head
forms
quickly
then
fades
moderate
lacing
remains
on
my
glass
as
the
minutes
pass
has
a
very
floral
and
malty
sweet
aroma
to
it
definitely
some
hoppiness
going
on
in
this
red
ale
some
piney
earthy
hop
flavor
to
start
bitter
floral
aftertaste
that
lingers
around
on
the
tongue
nicely
this
is
a
very
malty
tasting
beer
quite
bready
and
biscuity
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
and
a
very
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
leaning
towards
the
lightlight
medium
body
with
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
very
flavorful
in
the
hop
department
nicely
done
and
easily
drinkable
verdict
pretty
nice
brew
fairs
not
too
intense
on
most
levels
and
bolsters
a
closer
balance
of
malts
to
hops
without
going
overboard
on
either
ingredient
hop
lovers
should
notice
and
appreciate
the
presence
of
good
quality
decent
hops
in
fair
amounts
in
this
brew
while
those
who
dont
feel
for
hops
shouldnt
be
turned
away
pretty
nice
highland
did
well
with
this
b

i
felt
this
was
a
good
beer
but
could
have
used
more
malt
characteristics
to
be
in
better
balance
as
the
style
goes
this
insane
balance
is
both
this
beers
highpoint
and
setback
the
character
is
neither
a
hoppy
and
bitter
nor
smooth
and
malty
which
is
pleasing
balance
but
it
is
also
a
bit
underwhelming
deciding
which
way
to
think
about
this
beer
is
a
little
like
deciding
between
two
really
great
movies
you
want
to
watch
once
you
settle
down
and
pick
one
you
miss
the
other
great
drink
ability
def
a
nice
session
beer
pours
a
very
beautiful
amber
with
a
fluffy
two
inch
head
the
lacing
looks
like
a
paint
splatter
on
the
glass
not
much
going
for
it
in
the
smell
area
slight
malts
tiny
willamette
scent
eh
the
taste
is
interesting
the
bigger
the
mouthful
the
heavier
the
taste
very
nice
malt
background
with
a
fat
burst
of
hops
the
flavors
mix
together
quite
well
beats
out
my
old
amber
session
beer
fat
tire
there
is
almost
no
carbonation
on
the
mouth
i
have
one
more
12oz
so
ill
see
if
it
was
a
bottle
defect
other
than
that
very
smooth
super
easy
to
drink
i
could
throw
down
a
sixer
if
i
could
get
it
here
in
sf
d
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
wouldnt
be
that
difficult
because
it
isnt
that
filling
and
doesnt
have
a
high
alcohol
content
it
has
a
bread
like
aroma
with
a
slight
hint
of
herbal
hops
the
body
is
a
deep
amber
with
average
tan
head
but
great
lace
the
body
is
full
and
has
a
normal
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
a
bitter
but
not
too
bitter
taste
with
some
malty
bread
like
sweetness
at
first
it
finishes
with
a
some
what
herbal
and
roasted
finish
the
highland
gaelic
ale
is
a
great
amber
the
ale
has
a
great
nose
on
the
nose
it
has
some
light
malts
with
some
very
light
floral
the
mouth
feel
is
very
light
but
with
lots
of
flavor
the
gaelic
ale
has
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
not
one
overpowering
the
other
it
finishes
very
clean
and
crisp

recommended
try
d
quite
drinkable
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
a
delicious

ale
but
with
an
american
twist
im
becoming
a
bigger
fan
of
highlands
as
i
try
more
of
their
beers
especially
when
i
can
foray
up
into
north
carolina
and
get
them
pretty
fresh
another
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
thats
growing
on
me
anemic
malt
with
a
hint
of
roasted
flavors
hops
give
very
little
to
the
aroma
and
leave
a
dishwatery
aftertaste
im
not
sure
what
theyre
after
with
this
beer
there
are
so
many
better
amber
ales
i
cant
believe
this
one
should
rate
in
the
top
20
d
easy
to
drink
and
well
worth
it
when
you
can
find
it
fortunately
im
in
asheville
and
this
one
is
an
easy
find
for
me
its
packed
with
flavor
but
not
too
heavy
or
chewspitty
simply
put
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
and
is
a
must
try
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in

but
its
the
style
not
the
beer
d
geez
i
just
caught
myself
gulping
this
stuff
its
not
the
best
beer
by
a
long
shot
but
for
what
ever
reason
it
drinks
alarmingly
easily
good
beer
im
a
fan
totally
drinkable
very
balanced
it
is
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
everyone
else
d
lots
of
nicely
balanced
bitter
and
sweetness
which
is
not
overpowering
a
beer
like
this
makes
north
carolina
shine
within
the
robust
american
craft
beer
scene
a
slowgrilled
dryrubbed
pork
loin
with
baked
sweet
potatoes
is
a
perfect
pairing
this
was
easy
to
drink
and
it
would
be
easy
for
me
to
drink
these
all
night
d
overall
excellent
would
go
well
with
several
different
foods
and
i
would
enjoy
a
nice
session
evening
with
this
beer
great
job
highland
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
as
n
every
day
drinker
not
too
adventurous
but
good
to
drink
with
a
lot
of
the
food
that
i
cook
ill
be
keeping
at
least
a
few
of
these
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
which
disappates
to
skim
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
nice
caramel
backbone
with
piney
hops
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
and
sweet
malt
for
a
backbone
there
are
hints
of
dark
fruits
the
middle
and
back
have
a
nice
hop
kick
of
piney
and
earthy
hops
to
really
round
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
with
a
creamy
finish
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
well
balabced
and
a
fairly
easy
drink
its
complex
enough
that
it
keeps
u
interested
im
quite
intrigued
by
the
highland
beers
ive
tried
so
far
they
seem
to
have
a
flavor
profile
that
doesnt
immediately
give
what
youd
expect
for
the
style
brewed
this
results
in
something
both
unique
and
refreshing
the
gaelic
ale
has
a
perfect
balance
of
rich
malts
and
zesty
hop
bitterness
the
complexity
of
the
malt
is
much
more
that
you
get
from
a
typical
amber
ale
i
found
it
highly
drinkable
recommended
this
is
my
favorite
american
amberred
ale
so
far
it
pours
a
rich
reddish
brown
with
a
generous
head
this
beer
is
wonderfully
malty
and
creamy
with
enough
hops
to
balance
it
nicely
it
is
full
flavored
and
rich
but
not
overly
heavy
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
nut
a
very
balanced
red
ale
the
nose
is
decent
plenty
of
caramel
with
brown
sugar
and
a
little
toffee
there
really
isnt
a
lot
else
going
on
here
some
hop
character
is
present
but
this
is
mostly
just
sweet
hops
are
mildly
chalky
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
bitterness
with
some
citrus
hops
with
more
pithlike
bitterness
than
flavor
again
theres
a
moderate
malt
character
as
well
with
a
hodgepodge
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
toffee
all
rather
muddled
theres
a
moderate
sweetness
on
the
finish
along
with
a
rather
surprising
coffee
note
a
touch
of
citrus
as
well
theres
some
bitterness
present
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
decent
on
the
palate
decent
stuff
picked
up
a
few
of
these
from
a
beer
store
in
kill
devil
hills
as
part
of
a
mixed
pack
of
highland
brewing
company
pours
a
deep
orangered
color
with
a
fluffy
inch
tall
head
malt
character
was
very
well
balanced
with
a
few
toasted
malts
hiding
in
the
background
hops
were
not
to
overpowering
and
gave
a
nice
grassy
touch
to
the
brew
very
drinkable
because
i
wanted
to
down
a
few
more
after
this
one
was
done
not
overly
filling
at
all
great
buy
from
highland
brewing
this
ones
not
bad
at
all
i
ended
up
drinking
all
of
these
from
the
sampler
and
although
highland
did
redeem
itself
somewhat
this
one
did
not
work
for
me
no
recommended
f
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
slight
sweetness
slight
bitterness
with
a
little
grassy
mild
hop
flavor
and
some
earthy
flavors
lingering
crisp
ale
flavors
also
linger
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
body
was
a
bit
thick
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
gave
this
a
very
full
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
served
from
bottle
into
stone
nonic
pours
deep
copper
with
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
lingers
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
slight
fruit
and
nuttiness
the
flavor
is
comprised
of
smooth
and
crisp
malt
notes
with
a
subtle
nutty
flavor
mixed
in
it
has
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
from
highland
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
worth
a
shot
if
you
get
the
opportunity
d
overall
a
decent
take
on
the
style
malt
heads
will
enjoy
the
loads
of
caramel
while
hop
heads
should
be
pleased
with
everything
else
going
on
here
d
highlands
gaelic
ale
is
a
really
nice
amber
ale
meets
my
definition
of
a
session
beer
albeit
the
abv
is
a
little
too
high
nice
flavor
that
doesnt
destroy
your
palate
as
well
as
being
on
the
lower
end
of
the
abv
spectrum
well
done
highland
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
simple
smooth
and
has
some
character
but
i
have
to
admit
im
not
blown
away
i
think
either
the
addition
of
more
intense
hops
or
malt
or
both
would
really
allow
this
ale
to
stand
out
if
youre
looking
for
something
other
than
a
yuengling
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
a
nice
alternative
id
love
to
see
the
difference
ontap
fantastic
house
ale
this
is
a
good
beer
on
tap
i
have
had
the
bottle
as
well
and
its
not
so
good
i
really
like
a
cold
tap
though
great
with
pizza
and
the
taste
can
hold
up
to
rich
food
it
has
a
great
orangerust
color
with
a
lot
of
bitey
carbonation
give
it
a
try
on
tap
a
lot
better
than
the
bottle
reddish
gold
in
color
smells
slightly
maltsweet
with
a
kiss
of
hops
toffee
floral
hop
bitterness
in
the
taste
finishes
slighly
dry
a
nice
sessionable
amber
ale
and
one
of
highlands
flagship
beers
overall
a
less
than
stellar
brew
just
another
average
beer
to
lump
in
with
all
the
other
ones
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
reddish
amber
with
a
golden
head
smells
slightly
nutty
with
caramel
malts
tastes
very
malty
slightly
metallic
and
pretty
smooth
with
some
alcohol
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
but
okay
pretty
drinkable
i
could
put
probably
3
down
d
a
rather
uneventful
scottish
style
ale
regardless
of
what
the
bottle
says
this
tastes
like
an
american
style
scottish
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
if
ever
ive
had
one
lightly
sweet
little
hop
bitterness
or
aroma
and
refreshing
carbonation
d
this
was
a
average
drinker
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
i
would
gladly
buy
a
sixer
of
these
if
they
were
here
would
recommend
as
a
good
intro
into
craft
beers
d
this
is
a
nice
ale
my
first
highland
brew
and
i
enjoyed
it
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
aroma
but
there
is
some
lingering
skunk
it
starts
out
pretty
boring
then
brings
some
rye
and
a
light
hop
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
though
its
very
much
a
subdued
beer
because
im
in
north
carolina
i
sort
of
took
for
granted
that
id
be
getting
a
fresh
beer
but
now
that
im
looking
i
see
its
been
past
its
prime
by
about
a
month
still
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
before
and
ive
always
enjoyed
it
this
is
definitely
a
brew
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
creamy
a
nice
surprise
d
goes
down
smooth
and
clean
nice
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
high
could
use
some
more
hops
though
rather
muted
in
that
department
otherwise
a
good
beer
about
a
fingers
worth
of
tan
head
mostly
larger
bubbles
which
dissolve
swiftly
the
lacing
broad
but
also
slides
down
quickly
full
on
amber
red
with
enough
brown
to
darken
it
into
near
opacity
more
brighter
orange
around
the
rims
in
the
nose
theres
a
lot
of
interplay
between
the
caramel
molasses
and
the
pine
herbaceous
hops
orange
peel
milk
chocolate
brush
of
peach
and
apricot
fruit
long
presence
in
your
nostrils
fullbodied
and
broadly
set
as
in
the
nose
its
impressive
for
its
sheer
stature
and
weight
as
a
result
it
is
a
good
thing
the
carbonation
is
very
active
the
molasses
brown
sugar
caramel
sweeter
upon
mouth
entry
the
overall
finish
is
dry
very
leafy
almost
twiggy
the
pine
and
orange
lemon
citrus
elements
drier
than
expected
here
you
get
a
touch
of
softer
creamier
bread
dough
with
a
few
lactose
accents
easily
drinkable
while
in
no
manner
simple
d
drinkability
is
awesome
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
plenty
of
good
flavor
i
do
like
that
it
is
fairly
hoppy
easily
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
for
the
style
with
carbonation
on
the
low
side
smooth
and
fairly
sticky
a
very
nice
american
amber
that
i
could
see
gladly
sessioning
if
i
lived
in
the
area
i
like
it
better
than
the
duck
rabbit
amber
that
my
dad
bought
me
on
the
same
trip
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
these
again
the
ba
grade
will
be
lower
than
it
should
be
simply
because
i
did
not
rate
the
smell
favorably
as
it
was
super
subtle
tastes
good
though
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
few
could
object
to
overall
pretty
good
id
buy
it
if
i
were
out
and
saw
it
but
i
dont
think
id
grab
a
sixpack
of
it
even
just
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
to
counter
that
sweetness
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
i
will
deffinitely
drink
this
more
often
i
had
this
beer
at
the
lighthouse
in
wrightsville
this
beer
is
clear
in
body
amber
and
red
in
color
offwhite
head
is
ok
and
pops
butt
does
not
last
long
big
malt
in
aroma
backed
up
by
s
light
citric
flavour
i
wonder
what
hops
they
use
flavor
is
malt
with
moderate
hopping
not
a
bad
north
carolina
beer
buy
again
yes
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
nice
well
put
together
beer
d
wow
couldnt
finish
this
one
at
all
i
hope
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
dgreat
mouthfeel
on
a
rather
pedestrian
tasting
beer
this
one
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
when
cold
it
was
quite
dull
and
1dimensional
but
came
to
life
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
drinkability
is
great
its
a
tasty
brew
that
goes
down
easy
and
would
make
for
quite
a
nice
session
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
quite
a
few
of
these
in
the
future
d
this
brew
was
given
as
a
christmas
gift
but
ended
up
being
one
of
the
best
gifts
i
received
nice
job
by
this
small
brewery
in
asheville
will
purchase
more
of
this
brew
when
im
in
the
area
again
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
a
few
times
before
and
was
not
impressed
but
poured
out
of
the
bottle
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
and
found
it
not
to
be
another
one
of
those
bland
boring
amber
ales
definitely
interesting
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
in
succession
d
this
was
my
first
offering
from
highland
and
i
am
very
pleased
i
wish
i
could
get
this
around
here
regularly
a
good
malty
yet
slightly
hoppy
amber
im
looking
forward
to
more
from
highland
very
drinkable
too
bad
the
store
i
found
this
in
only
had
individual
bottles
and
no
sixers
d
highly
drinkable
a
well
rounded
beer
balanced
nicely
between
malts
and
hops
as
well
as
creaminess
and
carbonation
if
i
lived
around
here
i
could
definitely
use
this
as
a
basic
session
standard
dcould
have
a
few
of
these
a
night
and
not
regret
it
the
real
star
of
the
show
though
is
the
mouthfeel
its
mediumfull
and
creamy
and
pushes
what
is
clearly
a
good
beer
into
another
realm
terrific
on
a
cool
fall
evening
easy
drinking
the
taste
is
better
than
most
i
particularly
enjoy
the
balance
theres
a
solid
lighter
malt
base
with
a
pleasant
hop
counterpointnot
really
bitter
or
biting
the
body
is
okay
but
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
little
high
very
nice
beer
to
drink
and
goes
down
quickly
highland
brewery
lives
up
to
its
reputation
highland
gaelic
ale
is
my
first
beer
from
highland
brewing
nice
amber
color
but
appears
a
little
thin
makes
up
for
the
watery
look
by
being
pretty
flavorfull
malts
and
caramel
are
present
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
a
better
than
average
american
amber
red
ale
excellant
drinkability
drinkability
is
decent
but
it
ends
up
a
bit
bland
without
any
real
character
to
call
its
own
just
another
amber
beer
without
any
redeeming
qualities
drinks
easily
though
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
and
offers
exactly
what
i
expect
from
the
style
though
it
may
not
necessarily
be
enough
to
be
considered
outstanding
a
nice
find
at
kroger
and
definitely
worth
it
when
shopping
at
a
place
like
that
drinkability
a
solid
ale
definitely
one
of
the
better
scottishstyle
ales
out
there
give
it
a
shot
drinkability
i
liekd
it
once
i
realized
what
it
was
a
good
traiing
beer
for
the
rookies
and
well
made
like
i
said
this
is
a
better
fat
tire
d
very
nice
not
sure
id
pick
it
up
every
week
but
a
good
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
tasty
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
a
beer
that
i
keep
all
the
time
in
my
fridge
bye
nicely
done
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
have
had
it
on
multiple
occasions
i
think
it
really
represents
a
good
example
of
the
american
amber
ale
style
it
is
not
a
clean
beer
but
a
lovely
malty
and
hoppy
beer
has
great
drinkability
d
not
bursting
with
flavor
yet
this
would
is
nicely
done
and
would
make
an
ideal
session
beer
overall
im
highly
impressed
with
this
beer
most
beers
i
try
that
have
such
fancy
packaging
suck
ill
definitely
look
for
it
in
the
future
and
ill
definitely
have
to
go
back
to
the
store
to
try
their
ipa
that
was
sitting
next
to
this
stuff
the
carbonation
in
this
brew
was
perfect
and
was
a
nice
compliment
ot
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
the
density
of
this
brew
was
also
in
great
balance
not
thin
and
not
syrupy
this
is
a
good
brew
cold
a
well
above
average
as
it
warms
the
fruit
and
malt
slowly
builds
with
temperature
red
with
a
meal
much
more
than
standin
alone
next
up
in
the
highland
variety
pack
tasting
is
this
gaelic
ale
popping
the
cap
the
first
smell
is
earthy
hop
tones
then
followed
by
sweet
almost
butterscotch
smell
pours
to
a
deep
transparent
reddish
brown
with
a
multi
size
bubble
head
with
lots
of
action
head
laces
nicely
upon
receding
taste
is
very
earthy
peaty
hops
with
a
big
malty
backbone
mouthfeel
is
solid
this
brew
approaches
chewable
definitely
a
different
hop
approach
much
more
earthy
with
flatter
bitterness
tastes
more
like
an
english
ale
than
an
american
ale
to
me
but
so
be
it
it
is
a
very
good
beer
d
definitely
a
session
beer
good
flavor
but
its
not
over
the
top
everythings
in
balance
here
and
in
a
very
good
way
ill
definitely
look
out
for
this
one
in
local
bars
stores
and
the
like
the
mouth
feel
was
slightly
prickly
from
the
carbonation
with
a
mediumlight
body
it
was
easy
drinking
and
went
nicely
with
the
bbq
chicken
pizza
i
was
eating
tastes
like
it
smells
toasted
caramel
malts
up
front
sweeter
near
the
middle
with
medium
nodes
of
biscuit
and
jam
moving
into
a
lightly
bitter
hops
near
the
end
decent
hops
good
balance
but
they
play
second
fiddle
to
the
malt
and
that
is
fine
by
me
drinkability
very
sessionable
drinkability
smooth
enough
for
a
meal
and
quite
versatile
try
it
with
a
haggis
or
some
neeps
and
tatties
its
a
spot
on
scottish
ale
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
dissipates
to
leave
a
nice
cap
and
good
lacing
smells
of
nice
caramel
malts
sweet
and
with
just
a
hint
of
yeasty
spice
impressive
thick
caramel
maltiness
medium
bitter
hop
character
in
the
background
gives
it
a
slightly
dry
finish
as
fullbodied
as
it
is
fullflavored
pretty
pleasant
overall
this
would
be
a
great
fall
brew
on
a
crisp
morning
sitting
and
setting
up
at
a
tailgate
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
wet
disappointing
flavor
was
a
big
let
down
as
well
very
malty
and
sweet
finishes
like
toasted
brown
sugar
there
was
very
little
bitterness
in
this
at
all
pretty
bland
overall
i
was
sorely
disappointed
with
this
beer
as
ive
heard
good
things
ill
give
the
bottle
a
try
and
see
if
it
is
any
better
this
beer
has
a
solid
unique
character
its
respectable
but
as
far
as
drinking
a
lot
of
them
its
really
not
my
cup
of
beer
d
a
reasonably
drinkable
malty
beer
there
is
very
little
hop
character
and
while
the
beer
remains
balanced
due
to
a
surprising
level
of
dryness
unfortunately
this
robs
the
beer
of
complexity
and
causes
the
toasted
malt
character
in
the
finish
to
become
cloying
d
a
great
session
beer
that
we
are
lucky
to
have
in
this
area
props
again
to
highland
nice
creamy
head
in
my
2009
masters
tumbler
fades
to
a
little
outside
line
of
bubbles
looks
like
dark
iced
tea
roasted
malts
dissolve
to
west
coast
hops
go
ahead
have
2
or
3
of
em
mediumfull
body
smooth
slightly
chewy
with
a
nice
fade
out
effervescence
is
not
strong
at
all
a
very
good
brew
this
is
one
hell
of
an
amber
very
rich
and
vibrant
all
around
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
low
abv
means
this
is
a
great
sessionable
beer
d
a
nice
smooth
clean
beer
this
is
one
you
could
pound
back
a
sixer
in
a
few
hours
but
anymore
than
that
and
you
would
feel
like
you
ate
an
entire
3
course
meal
very
filling
beer
the
bottle
reads
a
deep
american
amber
colored
ale
featuring
a
rich
malty
body
cascade
and
willamette
hops
add
a
complex
hop
flavor
and
aroma
this
ale
is
exceptionally
balanced
between
malty
sweetness
and
delicate
hop
bitterness
overall
i
think
they
nailed
it
cheers
to
highland
for
this
one
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
ambers
ive
had
appearance
is
incredible
and
flavor
doesnt
fall
far
behind
the
delicious
mouthfeel
really
makes
it
enjoyable
and
just
goes
to
prove
that
highland
can
make
some
fairly
impressive
brews
nothing
amazingly
out
of
the
ordinary
but
a
damn
good
amber
another
winner
from
highland
brewing
this
one
is
fullflavored
and
nicely
balanced
a
good
allaround
ale
overall
a
good
bier
but
not
a
great
one
i
do
recommend
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
bier
prosit
solid
brew
from
an
underrated
brewery
drinkability
is
below
average
because
the
malts
make
this
a
relatively
heavy
amber
ale
not
that
i
expect
to
drink
reds
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
dont
expect
reds
to
conjure
up
images
of
willy
wonka
a
good
beer
but
one
of
the
first
ive
come
across
about
which
ive
questioned
the
style
d
this
brew
is
easy
drinking
however
i
could
see
the
hops
being
a
bit
much
after
several
of
theses
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
bitterness
mfd
a
little
bitter
in
my
opinion
finishes
smooth
and
clean
d
easily
sessionable
if
i
could
get
more
of
this
in
ohio
i
would
put
it
in
regular
rotation
very
drinkable
and
the
amber
stays
with
me
for
a
bit
on
my
tongue
which
is
great
d
its
a
touch
rough
around
the
edged
but
a
very
drink
able
brown
amber
i
like
this
a
lot
d
not
a
bad
ale
but
the
balance
is
off
d
i
had
2
thats
about
all
i
could
have
but
def
enjoyable
poured

deep

without
a

os

much
like
a

perhaps
crystal

some

nice

light

good
indeed
worth
a
shot
picked
up
a
sixpack
at
whole
foods
in
south
beach
appeared
a
dark
amberred
not
far
from
a
brown
ale
and
with
a
white
head
the
beer
drinks
dry
yet
it
feels
a
bit
heavy
at
the
same
time
the
flavor
has
a
mix
of
herbal
and
citrus
hops
with
light
toffee
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
overall
it
comes
off
light
an
american
red
ale
with
a
twist
well
made
and
certainly
worth
a
try
m
easily
drinkable
very
smooth
and
crisp
good
carbonation
wow
this
is
an
extremely
tasty
brew
very
smooth
and
creamy
citrusy
hop
flavor
is
much
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
has
a
nice
corn
flake
touch
to
it
that
adds
a
bit
of
toasty
complexity
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
access
to
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
beer
looks
great
and
smells
inviting
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
for
me
and
the
flavors
are
not
quite
what
the
nose
hinted
at
still
a
decent
brew
overall
im
glad
i
revisited
this
beer
as
when
i
had
it
from
the
bottle
on
numerous
previous
occasions
it
had
a
metallic
taste
that
turned
me
off
for
a
while
a
new
recipe
or
the
fact
that
i
had
it
from
the
tap
make
this
beer
a
whole
lot
better
worth
a
shot
wish
this
was
more
of
a
scotch
ale
but
just
not
there
highland
gaelic
ale
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
like
the
aroma
its
mostly
malty
toasted
malt
up
front
and
at
the
end
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
especially
for
this
style
but
i
find
it
enjoyable
pretty
good
pours
a
light
redruby
tinted
body
with
onefinger
head
and
some
lace
a
mild
sweet
malt
smell
along
with
minor
hop
notes
mediumbodied
although
it
straddles
being
lightbodied
the
malt
notes
and
hops
are
subdued
for
a
light
sweet
sensation
that
gives
the
tongue
a
minor
prick
on
the
backbite
caramel
malts
and
citric
hops
are
present
but
nothing
overpowering
an
alright
red
that
i
could
have
again
feel
is
very
smooth
theres
a
nice
creaminess
medium
body
excellent
balance
quite
drinkable
drinkability
despite
the
sweetnessunusual
flavors
its
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
would
make
an
outstanding
base
for
a
winter
warmer
and
has
more
flavor
than
any
amberred
ive
had
so
far
outstanding
beer
easy
to
drink
left
me
wanting
another
one
im
a
fan
of
highland
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
of
their
offerings
still
not
bad
trade
via
brentk56
easy
drinkability
on
this
one
is
good
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
enjoy
all
of
them
easily
d
i
love
this
beer
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
ive
become
a
real
highland
junkie
and
the
gaelic
ale
is
one
of
their
better
offerings
d
really
well
balanced
and
the
hop
flavor
is
like
smelling
pellets
but
not
overwhelming
great
stuff
the
aroma
has
rootbeer
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
smallish
sized
head
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
closely
matches
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
cardboard
like
overall
good
but
with
imperfections

to
tronraner

bright
and
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
a
sweet
nose
of
rich
caramel
some
toasted
malt
and
sugars
the
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
caramel
malts
some
balance
is
achieved
by
a
decent
hop
profile
a
soft
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
fairly
earthy
and
nice
this
beer
pours
a
clear

into
a
pint

from
the
bottle
gaelic
ale
has
about
a
inch
thick
tannish
head
that
stays
a
while
leaving
very
good
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
it
the
nose
is
a
caramel
malt
with
some
spicy
hop
notes
added
in
the
taste
is
a
clean
maltyness
with
a
pleasant
hop
bite
as
the
midnote
ending
with
a
bit
of
clean
but
biscuit
flavor
wow
very
nice
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
carbonation

it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer

is
a
mainstay
as
one
of
my
session
beers
when
it
is
available
have
not
had
a
bad
highland
beer
d
dinkability
is
really
good
this
would
make
for
a
great
session
brew
there
is
more
than
enough
going
on
in
this
beer
to
keep
it
interesting
and
it
is
simple
enough
to
put
away
all
night
long
alcohol
is
hidden
behind
the
flavors
pretty
well
which
just
adds
to
the
overall
drinkability
kudos
to
highland
for
a
tasty
brew
amberred
color
under
a
tight
offwhite
head
balanced
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
citrus
and
floral
hops
great
hoppy
flavor
a
mixture
of
sugary
tea
and
citrus
that
doesnt
get
too
bitter
a
rich
maltiness
rounds
it
all
out
nicely
a
little
dryness
in
the
finish
makes
me
practically
chug
the
whole
glass
firm
medium
body
i
cant
believe
ive
never
rated
this
one
its
pretty
darn
tasty
d
this
is
a
great
beer
once
it
reaches
about
50
degrees
fahrenheit
id
love
to
grab
this
again
next
time
i
need
a
growler
fill
at
riverside
and
they
have
it
available
thanks
to
michaeld23
for
this
one
good
ontap
choice
in
nc
pours
a
deep
amber
with
reddish
hues
and
a
medium
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
of
caramel
malt
light
fruit
and
spicy
earthy
hops
with
a
light
citrus
taste
is
much
of
the
same
and
adds
a
toasted
bread
to
the
mix
very
well
balanced
and
quite
flavorful
more
so
than
from
the
bottle
it
seems
good
lighter
body
with
solid
carbonation
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
to
counterbalance
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
a
session
amber
if
there
ever
was
one
d
notes
this
is
a
good
drinkable
red
the
fine
folks
at
highland
brewing
company
have
a
fine
line
of
brews
with
this
one
being
my
favorite
reddish
sort
of
hue
to
it
nice
lacing
left
on
the
glass
moderate
amount
of
hops
in
the
aroma
slight
maltiness
to
it
definate
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
carameltoffeish
flavor
decent
hop
bite
to
it
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
have
lost
my
taste
for
an
amberred
ale
in
my
old
age
this
could
help
restore
my
faith
received
in
trade
from
limesmut
and
mikesgroove
thanks
for
the
opportunity
guys
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
size
dirty
white
head
that
stick
around
a
bit
and
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
aroma
is
caramel
malty
with
some
citrusy
hops
in
there
as
well
i
smell
loads
of
caramel
and
some
mineral
in
the
background
tastes
malty
caramel
and
hops
round
it
out
nicely
maybe
a
touch
sweet
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
medium
body
that
finishes
quite
dry
but
lingers
with
bitterness
in
the
finish
decent
brew
for
an
american
amber
im
not
sure
what
makes
it
a
gaelic
ale
though
there
are
better
brews
out
there
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
id
drink
one
if
it
was
offered
to
me
thanks
to
unionturf
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
no
freshness
dating
indicated
on
the
bottle
poured
a
deep
translucent
amber
with
a
one
inch
frothy
offwhite
cap
that
almost
crested
the
lip
of
the
glass
head
eventually
settled
into
a
thin
broken
skim
with
only
a
few
spatterings
of
lacing
preent
during
the
tasting
nose
was
malty
with
a
light
floral
hops
aroma
in
the
background
taste
follows
nose
very
malty
with
a
toasted
caramel
character
maybe
even
an
earthypeatlike
quality
in
there
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
medium
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
unexpected
creaminess
excellent
drinkability
so
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
with
more
malt
than
hops
coming
out
just
the
way
i
like
it
this
is
a
handsome
beer
as
far
as
your
standard
amber
ale
goes
deep
clear
amber
color
with
a
light
tanyellowish
head
im
sticking
my
nose
as
deep
down
into
the
glass
as
i
can
go
and
im
not
picking
up
much
aroma
perhaps
some
mild
caramel
and
nutty
action
or
maybe
im
just
imagining
it
because
my
nose
is
all
jammed
into
this
thing
thankfully
it
does
have
flavor
and
there
is
more
of
a
hop
presence
here
than
in
most
typical
amber
ales
an
almost
sweet
caramel
malty
taste
followed
by
a
bitter
tang
of
hops
this
went
better
with
food
grilled
chicken
thighs
seasoned
with
sage
oregano
basil
etc
and
saltnpeppa
i
think
this
beer
will
go
well
with
leftover
thanksgiving
food
md
light
to
medium
bodied
a
touch
on
the
thinner
side
of
things
not
a
remarkable
brew
but
still
a
very
solid
session
beer
definitely
a
great
session
beer
where
you
should
drink
at
least
3
to
appreciate
it
d
easily
drinkable
bought
a
single
from
a
farmers
market
in
nc
had
this
particular
glass
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
a
beautiful
looking
red
ale
especially
on
draft
coppery
red
with
strawberry
highlights
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
very
light
aromas
of
somewhat
bready
malt
and
a
bit
of
yeasty
tanginess
deeper
flavors
than
suggested
by
the
nose
bready
malt
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
nuts
and
some
citrusy
hops
not
seemlessly
integrated
but
done
pretty
well
nevertheless
the
mouthfeeel
is
chewy
and
a
bit
sweet
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
d
very
high
drinkabilty
could
be
paired
with
anything
foodwise
pours
a
clean
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
maltiness
and
balanced
with
a
small
hop
in
the
taste
a
dryer
malt
and
almost
a
bit
peet
like
a
smooth
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
a
ballsy
ale
feels
big
a
nice
flavor
for
a
ale
confusingly
the
piper
in
the
picture
is
holding
a
boastful
mug
of
some
lighter
color
brew
than
the
one
that
came
out
of
my
bottle
he
ought
to
be
drinking
what
i
am
for
it
is
uncommonly
good
certainly
worth
a
try
everything
ive
had
from
highland
has
been
pretty
good
overalla
malty
sweet
version
of
the
amber
ale
style
a
fine
beer
with
an
interesting
off
flavor
i
wonder
what
that
is
either
way
an
ok
beer
this
is
a
smooth
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
caramel
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
some
caramel
smoke
and
some
hops
in
the
finish
that
helps
balance
this
one
out
overall
highland
gaelic
ale
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
worth
a
shot
good
beer
something
in
there
i
cant
quite
get
my
arms
around
the
draft
version
of
this
beer
arrives
with
a
clear
garnet
body
alive
with
numerous
trickles
of
active
carbonation
capped
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
drink
smells
and
tastes
much
sweeter
and
spicier
than
the
bottled
version
with
less
carbonation
and
a
stickier
mouthfeel
a
little
slick
and
sticky
i
preferred
it
in
the
bottle
where
it
seemed
less
sweet
and
much
hoppier
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
beer
its
sweetness
is
never
cloying
and
its
alcohol
content
is
low
so
its
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
so
drink
up
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
head
of
foam
delicious
sweet
aroma
of
molasses
smooth
even
mouthfeel
well
balanced
deliciously
sweet
taste
on
top
finishing
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
an
excellent
example
of
an
amber
ale
big
shout
out
to
my
buddy
mike
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
5er
yea
i
said
5er
of
this
after
his
recent
trip
to
nc
it
pours
a
brilliant
ruby
brown
color
with
a
big
brown
and
white
spotted
head
awesome
stickinglacing
nice
nose
of
wood
chocolatey
sweet
malts
some
spice
and
some
cherry
and
other
fruit
notes
mostly
malty
semi
sweet
malts
at
that
pretty
crisp
fruity
feel
to
it
a
bit
of
smokey
wood
chips
and
tobacco
a
touch
of
citrus
and
hop
bitterness
upon
the
finish
it
leaves
a
very
woody
malty
bitter
aftertaste
im
loving
it
this
may
turn
some
people
off
though
after
it
sat
for
a
while
the
aftertase
became
a
bit
metallic
not
very
offensive
good
medium
mouthfeel
decent
complexity
light
carbonation
and
pretty
damn
easy
to
drink
good
beer
taste
starts
out
malty
then
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
not
overly
hoppy
some
citrus
elements
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
gentle
carbonation
enhances
the
mouthfeel
great
session
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
can
easily
stick
with
this
all
night
great
body
thick
mouthfeel
compared
to
most
redsambers
which
seems
to
play
better
with
the
maltcentered
flavors
carbonated
well
highly
drinkable
beer
certainly
one
of
my
gotos
one
of
the
best
locals
around
d
while
i
generally
prefer
my
red
ales
to
be
hop
heavy
this
was
still
enjoyable
drinkable
and
very
well
done
thanks
to
muenchenerkindl
for
this
one
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
bright
white
in
color
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
of
caramel
toffee
and
grapefruit
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
and
very
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
is
nothing
special
d
i
think
this
has
potential
to
be
a
session
beer
for
me
its
a
bit
sweet
to
have
too
many
of
highland
makes
some
good
stuff
and
this
is
certainly
a
good
one
as
well
this
is
only
the
second
time
i
had
this
and
i
remember
liking
it
more
the
first
time
but
certainly
good
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
its
just
not
one
that
stands
out
from
the
pack
of
not
only
the
highland
lineup
or
at
least
the
four
or
five
that
ive
sampled
but
ambersreds
in
general
that
said
if
this
is
the
worst
thing
a
brewery
has
going
for
it
than
thats
not
a
bad
position
to
be
in
as
this
is
still
a
good
brew
another
nice
once
from
highland
a
highly
quaffable
moderately
hopped
ale
not
a
monumental
brew
in
flavor
but
balanced
delicate
and
pleasant
d
good
drinkability
pours
a
pretty
dark
red
with
a
small
to
medium
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
and
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
and
malty
caramel
bready
maltiness
toasty
not
overly
sweet
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
balance
things
out
medium
bodied
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
american
ambers
ive
had
in
a
while
pours
a
great
deep
ruby
color
with
good
initial
head
goes
away
quickly
and
some
slight
lacing
decent
malty
aroma
but
its
not
very
strong
great
taste
a
nice
deep
filling
malt
flavor
with
little
hints
of
a
scoth
ale
thrown
in
along
with
a
very
slight
butterscotch
flavor
goes
down
very
smooth
if
a
little
thick
an
excellent
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
deep
amber
and
nice
foamy
head
are
a
great
presentation
for
this
beer
there
is
only
a
mild
carbonation
the
cascade
hops
come
right
through
in
the
nose
very
distinctive
the
taste
is
has
a
slight
burnt
characteristic
there
is
a
balance
of
hops
and
malt
but
then
on
the
back
end
there
is
an
astrigent
taste
the
body
is
mild
which
allows
for
a
lot
of
drinking
but
after
two
im
ready
to
move
onto
bigger
and
better
overall
a
great
flagship
ale
from
a
strong
local
brewery
equally
satisfying
as
a
session
beer
and
an
allaround
food
companion
perfect
with
pizza
try
with
other
italian
fare
as
well
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
with
soft
to
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
wellbalanced
amber
ale
that
is
very
quaffable
overall
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
mostly
a
good
beer
with
a
little
kick
it
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
rich
translucent
mahogany
with
a
finebubbled
tan
head
aroma
is
mainly
malty
with
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
and
has
a
strong
spicy
undertone
this
ales
texture
is
smooth
but
it
goes
down
with
some
sass
and
zing
perhaps
a
little
overcarbonated
but
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
quite
a
nice
drinker
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
light
and
dry
on
the
hops
makes
me
happy
here
and
there
and
this
one
works
well
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
solid
malty
base
good
stuff
recommended
i
was
not
expecting
too
much
from
this
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ambers
i
have
had
i
like
the
smoky
undertones
in
this
one
this
all
led
to
a
nice
long
bitter
finish
that
was
rounded
out
by
the
malty
sweetness
a
darn
good
beer
t
very
malty
full
bodied
beer
and
in
general
very
pleasant
to
drink
slightly
sticky
with
persistent
aftertaste
of
bready
malt
and
a
little
hops
caramel
from
nose
is
also
present
and
finish
has
a
little
hop
bitterness
for
balance
carbonation
is
present
but
in
background
overall
not
my
favorite
amber
but
for
what
it
is
very
good
my
favorite
highland
brew
ive
tried
so
far
this
is
highlands
flagship
ale
and
in
my
opinion
their
best
it
poured
with
a
pretty
deep
amber
hue
and
a
big
appetizing
head
the
smell
was
very
good
a
great
mix
of
bready
malts
and
hops
the
taste
retains
the
breadiness
of
the
smell
with
a
good
measure
of
cascade
and
willamette
hops
keeping
it
in
check
i
find
this
style
to
be
tempermental
and
easy
to
mess
up
but
highland
has
a
brew
to
be
proud
of
a
great
drinking
beer
im
going
to
go
have
a
pizza
with
it
right
now
will
probable
grab
another
one
while
im
at
it
overall
nice
easydrinking
beer
not
overly
complex
but
enough
is
present
to
please
the
palate
overall
not
too
bad
a
beer
it
isnt
the
most
complex
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
has
a
good
bite
and
is
surprisingly
refreshing
this
is
really
very
good
for
a
style
that
is
ofter
mediocre
at
best
and
the
bagpipes
man
you
gotta
love
the
bagpipes
very
nice
i
really
liked
the
interaction
of
the
roasted
and
caramel
malts
in
this
guy
as
well
as
the
pleasant
bitterness
it
ended
with
a
fine
tasting
and
very
drinkable
amber
ale
d
this
is
a
very
good
ale
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
good
taste
this
is
worth
trying
sometime
a
red
ale
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
that
makes
it
on
the
scottish
heritage
given
highlands
theme
its
in
the
aroma
and
the
aroma
gives
off
a
booziness
far
behind
its
ranking
quite
malty
and
cinammoney
and
medium
plus
mouthfeel
with
hop
bitterness
rounding
off
the
finish
reddish
brown
colour
with
white
foam
covering
the
highland
line
is
generally
one
of
my
favorites
but
this
particular
ale
is
closer
to
mediocre
not
bad
generally
enjoyable
very
tasty
beer
just
not
a
true
amber
i
buy
this
stuff
a
lot
usually
ontap
and
it
never
disappoints
really
good
if
you
cant
decide
between
a
malty
or
hoppy
beer
my
first
highland
brew

a

but
has
a
bit
of
a
tart
finish
good
flavor
but
maybe
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
a
good
offering
of
this
style
not
too
hoppy
and
quite
enjoyable
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
will
definitely
seek
out
next
time
i
am
in
the
region
great
beer
i
did
not
expect
this
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
could
drink
this
one
all
day
overall
this
is
a
nice
offering
but
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
of
course
i
am
not
too
big
on
this
style
of
beer
either
but
i
was
really
excited
initally
with
this
one
toward
the
middle
to
the
end
of
this
beer
i
was
let
down
it
was
like
it
fell
flat
on
its
face
after
the
first
taste
or
two
but
i
did
like
it
and
i
would
definitely
drink
another
a
pint
ontap
at
the
red
drum
taphouse
in
nc
it
arrives
a
clear
chestnut
with
low
carbonation
and
a
halfinch
of
khaki
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
smells
earthy
and
smoked
fruity
with
some
caramel
light
hops
and
a
dash
of
currants
it
is
a
fairly
malty
beer
with
earth
caramel
toffee
and
toasted
notes
barely
balanced
by
herbalminty
and
grassyspicy
hops
that
impart
a
medium
bitterness
nearly
full
on
the
palate
smooth
and
coating
with
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
finish
overall
a
tasty
brew
and
wellbalanced
despite
the
large
amounts
of
malts
easy
enough
to
drink
several
this
one
drinks
bigger
than
what
it
is
and
thats
a
compliment
its
not
overly
sweet
or
caramelly
as
far
too
many
ambers
or
red
can
tend
to
be
but
neither
is
it
too
roasty
like
a
stout
with
a
serious
pigmentation
problem
this
is
a
well
balanced
fruity
malty
chocolatey

well
made

a
dark
copper

ale
with
a
solid

some
goodly
gobs
of

the
aroma
is
a
mild
malty
cereal
deal
hard
to
nail
down
and
not
particularly
strong
the
flavor
is
much
more
definitive
in
great
malt
character
with
some
clove
and
raspberrycherry
and
chocolate
really
complex
and
fun
to
drink
well
carbonated
and
not
heavy
in
alcohol
so
it
is
easy
drinking
for
the
style
medium
feel
maybe
even
a
bit
light
for
this
type
of
brew
but
very
enjoyable
definitely
try
this
one
as
something
easy
to
like
and
a
little
different
malt
is
the
theme
and
its
a
good
one
drinkability
highlands
given
us
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
amber
which
is
awfully
decent
of
them
the
taste
was
quite
good
a
big
malty
backbone
with
touches
of
carmel
and
brown
sugar
dominated
the
palate
while
a
decent
hoppiness
rounded
off
the
flavor
a
slight
fruitiness
rounded
out
the
flavor
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lightbodied
with
a
lack
of
bitterness
to
it
that
was
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
malty
sweetness
drinkability
was
superior
as
well
i
couldve
had
a
few
of
these
if
time
had
permitted
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
can
find
pretty
readily
at
the
bars
in
my
location
its
got
a
nice
refreshing
and
crisp
feel
it
tastes
very
well
balanced
with
a
light
malt
touched
with
a
bit
of
piney
hop
that
is
far
from
over
the
top
smells
similar
with
a
bit
more
emphasis
on
the
hop
the
beer
looks
like
a
beer
it
has
a
light
head
ontop
its
amber
body
overall
quite
drinkable
nicely
balanced
i
would
certainly
have
again
drinkability
good
beer
the
sweet
and
nutty
flavors
blend
well
with
the
hops
at
the
end
for
a
tasty
combination
d
pretty
good
job
on
this
amber
ale
definitely
stands
out
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
what
makes
it
a
great
choice
and
the
malt
character
is
one
for
those
who
are
looking
for
that
breadlike
fix
d
very
good
beer
if
i
could
get
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
quite
often
i
think
i
need
to
find
a
clone
recipie
so
i
can
try
making
this
beer
cause
i
think
it
would
go
over
pretty
well
with
most
everybody
a
very
nice
sipper
or
a
hot
afternoon

the

i
tried
from

this
one
was
nothing
like
the
two
others
i
had
tried
notes
like
i
said
at
the
front
of
this
review
i
just
love
the
offerings
from
highland
this
is
no
exception
this
was
a
great
beer
for
a
relaxed
evening
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
pick
some
up
its
a
cant
miss
drank
really
easy
colud
session
on

highland
gaelic
ale
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
plenty
of
malty
goodness
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
in
the
finish
to
lend
a
bit
of
bitterness
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
sugary
sweetness
with
a
light
citrusy

abv
this
might
be
on
the
high
side
of
what
most
people
consider
a
session
beer
but
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
back
without
any
complaints
a
very
good
amber
ale
that
is
worth
seeking
out
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
this
up
in
nc
seek
and
enjoy
now
i
wonder
what
the
imperial
version
whs
like
smell
was
pleasant
with
a
nicely
balanced
offering
of
herbal
hops
and
toasted
cereal
malts
taste
was
well
balanced
too
with
a
nice
blast
of
bitter
hops
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
malty
dry
finish
this
was
very
drinkable
and
a
great
brew
on
draught
d
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
red
d
average
abv
leads
to
a
nice
possibility
of
drinking
more
than
one
which
i
would
be
more
than
glad
to
do
however
only
have
one
will
have
to
get
a
sixer
next
time
im
in
the
outer
banks
for
the
beach
good
stuff
from
good
brewer
orangeamber
colored
with
a
light
caramel
head
this
beer
is
translucent
but
not
cloud
which
was
interesting
the
translucent
part
considering
how
light
the
color
is
head
does
fade
but
theres
solid
lacing
smell
was
a
combination
caramelbrown
sugar
with
a
very
faint
bit
of
orangecitrus
nice
combo
hops
kick
in
with
the
taste
but
the
maltiness
doesnt
die
down
either
still
mostly
caramel
but
also
some
roasted
quality
blended
in
solid
balance
the
hop
bitterness
is
there
toward
to
finish
but
doesnt
actually
linger
which
may
make
this
beer
seem
too
sweet
for
some
nice
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
longing
to
be
served
on
draft
drinkability
definite
session
ale
here
as
several
of
these
can
be
had
in
a
single
session
i
had
this
on
tap
and
it
seemed
quite
fresh
so
the
flavors
were
nicer
than
what
you
may
get
in
an
older
bottle
poured
with
a
rather
limited
cream
colored
head
that
disappated
quickly
not
too
much
aroma
just
a
slight
cascade
hop
presence
taste
is
where
this
ale
shines
got
some
roasty
caramel
notes
from
the
malt
with
earthy
citrus
hops
on
top
the
gaelic
does
a
good
job
of
unifying
these
disparate
flavors
in
the
mouth
its
a
bit
stickier
than
called
for
but
that
doesnt
make
any
less
drinkable
my
1st
highland
beer
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
with
it
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
maybe
i
just
picked
up
the
wrong
offering
either
way
i
will
visit
this
beer
again
and
will
certainly
continue
to
try
highland
offerings
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
but
is
nothing
spectactular
gaelic
ale

a
nice
amber
hue
with
a
finger
thick
khaki
colored
head
which
dies
down
to
a
thin
lacing
pretty
quick
stickiness
is
spotty
but
there
smell
is
a
bit
weak
but
a
toasted
nut
malt
seems
to
dominate
the
nose
a
small
bit
of
earthy
hops
seems
to
emerge
as
well
taste
was
quite
a
surprise
but
a
pleasant
one
at
that
very
nice
caramel
malt
with
a
good
balance
of
citrus
hops
which
gives
this
one
an
overall
sweet
character
to
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
definitely
there
but
the
sweetness
may
take
away
from
it
after
a
few
possible
session
beer
thanks
again
to
sean
for
this
one

is
a
good

watered
down
in
my
opinion
it
wants
to
be
more
thick
than
it
is
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
legs

session
brew
that
didnt
wow
me

does
good
things

this
may
be
the
most
pedestrian
of
their
offerings

the

taste

the

very
refreshing

definitely
makes

of
the
best

this

sir
may
i
have
another

rust

from

12oz

very
hoppy
with

strong
whiff
a

not
much
head
and
there
is
medium
lacing
first
tastequite
smooth
but
less
hoppy
than
i
thought
base
on
the
smell
but
more
hoppy
than
malty
i
cannot
wonder
what
this
ale
would
be
like
on
draft
another
fine
showing
from
the
folks
at

of

poured

was
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
a

in

the
taste
was
very
much
sugary
malts
with
again
a
bit
of
a
grain
or
earthy
back
to
it
very
nice
actually
this
is
very
nicely
carbonated
and
goes
down
smooth
a
good
beer
from
highland
this
could
easily
be
an
all
night
beer
as
it
is
light
and
tasty
d
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
to
complex
or
strong
great
for
a
beer
to
sit
and
relax
with
making
it
a
great
every
time
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
soft
and
dusty
very
drinkable
not
much
about
this
one
stands
out
but
it
is
perfect
for
a
rather
neglected
and

irish

are

this
one
here
just
about
defines

very

then
spicy
american
hops
running
up
the

with
lingering

a
decent
if
but
not
really
exciting
beer
when
i
first
started
on
ba
i
didnt
think
id
ever
be
able
to
try
this
beer
that
just
shows
you
the
power
of
trading
i
wasnt
disappointed
at
all
looking
forward
to
the
other
two
highland
beers
that
i
got
in
the
trade
and
then
trading
for
more
drinkability
good
could
drink
a
few
in
a
night
strong
malt
profile
in
the
taste
with
deep
lasting
coffee
flavor
tempered
by
caramel
and
a
touch
of
cascade
hops
at
the
front
of
the
sip
delicious
smooth
chocolaty
aftertaste
lots
going
on
in
this
tasty
brew
and
none
of
it
is
like
any
irish
red
ive
ever
had
still
this
is
a
quality
easy
drinking
brew
with
character
and
originality
even
though
the
style
is
irish
red
ale
the
gaelic
is
on
another
level
of
red
ale
excellence
its
distinct
and
should
be
the
first
thing
you
order
when
its
on
the
menu
enjoy
d
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
d
tasty
little
beer
flavor
is
a
little
quiet
could
use
a
little
bigger
body
in
all
respects
another
solid
offering
from
highland
a
nice
caramel
comes
out
than
the
hops
and
malts
and
fresh
baked
bread
great
balance
of
deep
malt
sweetness
and
i
sure
wish
we
could
get
it
up
here

experienced
in

the

doesnt

the
whole
ordeal
either
but
generally
sorry
mh
this
tasted
like
someones
earlyeffort
homebrew
sorry
a
total
miss
for
me
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
piney
and
a
little
earth
with
a
nice

presence
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
good

to
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
light

medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
crisp

over
all
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
of
far
better
quality
than
most
of
the
fare
offered
at
a
typical
liquor
store
it
doesnt
necessarily
bring
anything
new
to
the
tableplenty
of
beers
fall
into
the
hoppy
amber
ale
categorybut
what
it
does
do
it
does
definitively
and
reflects
the
brewers
obvious
love
for
the
craft
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
kind
of
on
the
gross
side
the
second
time
and
all
the
times
after
that
i
found
it
to
be
better
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
yellowish
fan
head
there
is
a
decent
lacing
for
this
beer
the
smell
gives
of
a
pretty
good
malt
and
hop
profile
the
taste
has
a
good
balance
of
flavors
too
but
it
seems
to
have
a
toasted
or
burnt
quality
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
about
medium
bodied
overall
roxy
isnt
too
bad
but
its
just
not
my
favorite
from
magic
hat
overall
very
solid
and
a
nice
sessionable
and
malty
ale
i
was
actually
quite
happy
with
this
one
and
glad
to
have
grabbed
one
for
sure
d
with
its
lighter
mouthfeel
very
much
a
drinkable
beer
i
really
hope
we
havent
seen
the
last
of
roxy
rolles
its
the
best
thing
magic
hat
offered
d
the
best
beer
magic
hat
offers
nice
medium
nutty
beer
with
faint
hints
of
citrus
very
drinkable
always
got
it
in
a
variety
pack
when
i
thought
magic
hat
was
the
bomb
it
was
my
favorite
though
it
does
lack
malt
balance
the
ride
is
an
even
one
and
it
is
what
it
saysa
hoppy
amber
ale
its
also
nice
to
see
so
much
damn
hop
flavor
from
a
beer
thats
only
35
ibu
proving
once
again
that
hop
usage
doesnt
need
to
be
reckless
to
be
big
and
bold
this
one
could
give
most
ipas
a
run
for
their
money
and
is
a
must
try
for
hopheads
not
likely
to
get
this
again
d
tasty
hoppy
but
not
bitter
and
not
filling
dvery
good
to
sip
on
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
well
leave
it
at
that
pours
a
rich
nearly
hazy
amber
red
with
a
creamy
twofingerthick
head
that
leaves
a
thick
bit
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
mostly
pine
and
citrus
the
hops
clearly
dominating
this
category
though
there
is
a
very
faint
hint
of
wheat
trying
to
peek
in
from
behind
the
clouds
the
taste
transports
that
wheat
forward
a
bit
though
the
hops
continue
to
pump
in
the
piny
citrus
regardless
not
all
that
surprising
the
body
is
moderate
the
carbonation
steady
all
leading
to
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
pours
a
deep
complex
brown
color
very
nice
khaki
colored
head
retention
it
smells
malty
with
a
few
quality
hints
of
hoppy
notes
the
falvor
is
simple
but
nice
has
an
earthy
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
a
very
nice
offering
i
hope
they
make
it
available
next
fall
this
beer
us
a
typical
brown
with
a
malty
nose
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
head
on
this
beer
is
a
tan
the
interesting
part
is
the
white
lacing
it
leaves
on
the
glass
this
beer
start
malty
sweet
and
finished
with
a
chocolate
bitterness
in
between
the
two
is
a
sour
fruitiness
similar
to
that
of
a
dopplebock
this
is
what
sets
it
apart
from
other
browns
this
is
a
flavorful
and
drinkable
brown
the
local
meijer
has
single
bottles
for
a
large
variety
of
beers
1
49
so
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
it
pours
out
a
dark
carmel
color
and
has
a
huge
largebubbled
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
forever
i
smell
sweet
carmel
malt
floral
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
fruityness
a
citrus
fruit
like
a
tangerine
or
a
clementine
perhaps
the
flavor
has
several
characteristics
that
combine
into
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
flavors
are
sweetsour
fruit
sweet
maltyness
maple
and
hoppy
pine
good
sort
of
tart
aftertaste
nice
consistancy
and
texture
and
good
to
sip
on
d
good
flavor
and
very
smooth
body
low
enough
abv
to
make
this
a
sessionable
ale
however
nothing
really
stands
out
to
seperate
this
from
the
rest
drinkability
yet
another
good
brew
from
the
magic
hat
lineup
got
this
one
in
a
mixed
pack
and
so
far
ive
been
impressed
with
their
quality
not
sure
just
how
many
of
these
i
would
drink
in
one
setting
2
or
3
maybe
thats
why
it
was
in
the
mixed
box
all
good
things
in
moderation
i
guess
i
has
this
in
a
mixed
pack
and
was
quickly
turned
off
pours
to
a
reddish
brown
color
with
an
ok
head
smells
like
flowers
from
all
the
hops
in
it
the
taste
of
the
hops
are
not
overwhelming
but
they
are
still
there
in
force
rather
bitter
but
has
a
slight
sweet
character
not
good
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
however
the
head
was
gone
pretty
fast
lacing
was
really
good
smell
of
this
beer
was
toffee
and
taste
was
slightly
however
the
hops
blew
away
what
would
have
been
a
great
beer
no
buy
again
taste
is
surprisingly
hoppy
and
bitter
with
quite
a
bit
of
almost
homebrew
twang
kind
of
an
earthy
flavor
i
not
a
huge
fan
of
that
flavor
but
otherwise
its
pretty
solid
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
yellow
stained
head
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
an
fair
retension
before
i
even
take
a
whiff
the
citrus
hops
are
dominating
very
strong
grapefruit
and
floral
aroma
with
some
malt
sweetness
as
well
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
an
malt
the
malt
taste
upfront
quickly
changes
to
a
bitter
finish
light
carb
med
feel
overall
not
bad
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
looking
for
a
cascade
fix
drinkability
is
pretty
good
im
really
liking
this
take
on
an
amber
ale
it
would
surly
would
have
tasted
better
fresh
but
i
liked
the
way
it
evolved
my
folks
picked
it
up
at
the
grocery
they
have
only
been
selling
beer
like
that
in
pa
for
less
then
a
year
but
i
doubt
this
was
fridge
kept
the
whole
time
still
glad
to
have

beer
that
effectively
replaced

though
i
am
heartbroken
that
i
cant

one
of
favorite
beers
anymore
i
am
glad
a
brew
as
good
as
this
one
comes
in
its
place
look
for
it
this
beer
is
fantastically
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
sipping
two
or
three
on

crisp
autumn
evening

id
have
said
apa
not

perhaps
a

on

plenty
hoppy
to
keep
the
likes
of
me
happy
lovely
lacing
throughout
a
very
nice
amber
ale
from
magic

i
enjoyed
every
sip
a
decently
satisfying
autumn
seasonal
as
the
label
would
have
it
ale
that
could
easily
draw
my
attention
away
from
oktoberfestbiers
this
time
of
year
its
a
roughly
carbonated
amber
but
better
harsh
than
bland
really
roxy
rolles
reminds
me
of
a

and
is
a

to
wade
through
and
disect
notes
i
had
been
waiting
for
a
hoppy
ale
after
having
a
lot
of
seasonal
lagers
definitely
a
solid
hoppy
beer
to
enjoy
anytime
smells
and
tastes
great
d
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
not
something
i
would
reach
for
immediately
but
if
the
choices
were
generic
macros
common
imports
or
this
i
would
choose
to
roll
with
the

a

enjoyed
this
even
though
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
fall
beer
for
sure
magic
hat
you
got
me
again
not
a
drain
pour
but
definitely
not
spectacular
either
not
ripping
the
brew
or
anything
just
nothing
really
awesome
to
say
about
it
this
was
an
enjoyable
autumn
ale
not
quite
as
hearty
as
i
was
expecting
for
a
fall
seasonal
but
far
better
that
most
amber
ales
this
beer
has
personality
for
a
red
and
thats
a
good
thing
beautiful
deep
whiskey
color
with
massive
lacing
and
head
fresh
hop
pungency
in
the
nose
tsste
is
up
there
almost
with
nugget
nectar
the
best
of
mh
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
perfect
and
can
hardly
be
separated
from
the
taste
experience
thick
and
luscious
too
too
drinkable
drinkability
is
high
solid
offering
from
magic
hat
d
very
drinkable
for
how
strong
it
is
just
cant
put
it
down
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
middle
of
the
road
with
some
decent
carbonation
this
all
adds
up
to
a
pretty
drinkable
product
not
too
shabby
at
all
they
should
market
this
heavier
than
the
9
within
craft
circles
note
the
label
is
also
a
winner
d
d
nice
beer
to
have
after
a
long
hike
d
this
is
probably
the
best
magic
hat
brew
ive
had
find
myself
telling
my
wife
to
get
the
night
of
the
living
dead
pack
she
drinks
the
circus
boys
and
9s
i
like
the
odd
notion
and
roxy
rolles
very
seasonable
enjoyable
brew
overall
started
out
good
but
went
downhill
things
didnt
seem
to
blend
well
i
probably
wont
be
having
this
one
again
12oz
brown
bottle

on

vigorous
pour
into
a
tulip
produces
a
full
tight
head
which
fades
to
a
thin
lace
beautiful
dark
ruby
color
clear
herbal
hops
balanced
with
some
roasted
malt
on
the
nose
not
too
complex
good
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
great

compliment

good
carbonation
medium

just
what
i
would
hope
for
very
sessionable
mellow
great
for
food
especially
cheeses
and
fatty
meats
definately
enjoyed
i
enjoyed
this
one
pours
an
amber
red
with
a
white
head
first
whiff
is
of
hops
but
then
you
get
malt
which
makes
me
think
it
will
be
a
nice
balanced
beer
this
is
definitely
a
hoppier
amber
ale
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
maybe
grapefruits
but
also
enough
malt
to
make
it
balanced
i
know
that
american
amberred
ale
is
somewhat
of
a
catchall
term
but
this
is
what
i
want
when
i
drink
a
beer
of
this
style
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
smooth
great
beer
final
thoughts
an
interesting
take
on
an
autumn
seasonal
they
took
their
original
spring
roxy
rolles
hoppy
amber
and
oktoberfested
it
up
a
few
notches
seems
to
have
quite
a
bit
of
german
malts
and
hops
and
it
seems
from
what
ive
read
to
be
pretty
true
to
what
an
oktoberfest
used
to
be
as
the
germans
were
the
ones
that
really
found
a
niche
with
hopping
beers
i
really
enjoy
this
and
im
glad
i
found
it
to
add
to
the
oktoberfest
beer
lineup
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
overall
a
good
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
some
lacing
thruout
the
smell
is
sweet
malts
and
some
hops
but
mainly
malts
the
taste
is
a
malt
forward
amber
hit
on
the
senses
followed
by
some
average
hopspice
citruspine
and
grapefruit
tastes
it
pretty
well
balanced
but
with
a
nod
to
the
sweet
caramel
malts
that
are
in
charge
in
this
one
it
is
good
tasting
easy
to
throw
back
several
of
these
its
recommended
if
you
like
pale
ale
and
ipas
as
this
one
is
a
light
version
of
those
styles
but
this
aleis
not
on
on
the
rotation
for
me
the
abv
is
low
enough
for
chugging
but
the
flavors
are
quite
complex
and
that
hop
kick
makes
it
seem
a
bit
stronger
than
it
actually
is
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
one
fingered
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
with
pretty
much
no
hop
smell
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
suprisingly
nice
maltbase
to
this
brew
there
is
also
some
nice
bitterness
and
some
nice
citrusy
hop
flavors
nice
mouthfeel
and
an
easy
drinker
well
done
on
tap
at
not
your
average
joes
in
randolph
ma
brought
to
me
in
a
standard
pint
glass
this
beer
comes
out
an
amber
brown
color
that
looks
similar
in
color
to
a
melted
brown
sugar
has
a
haze
to
it
but
slight
clarity
when
held
up
to
the
light
this
beer
has
a
small
off
white
colored
head
with
some
of
the
best
lacing
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
before
its
still
at
the
top
of
the
glass
even
when
youre
finished
with
it
the
smell
is
good
dominated
by
the
hops
which
isnt
something
youd
quite
expect
from
a
fall
or
winter
style
of
beer
followed
by
the
strong
hop
smell
are
some
other
notes
of
winter
spices
but
really
just
an
after
essence
the
taste
is
very
very
good
seems
to
be
more
of
a
pine
hop
than
citrus
but
likely
a
bit
of
both
you
can
also
detect
some
of
the
spices
maybe
cinnomin
and
some
roasted
malt
and
grain
there
is
also
a
sour
or
tart
type
taste
that
may
come
from
some
type
of
fruit
that
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
which
brings
me
to
the
mouthfeel
it
left
a
dry
feeling
in
your
mouth
similar
to
when
you
bite
into
an
apple
that
hasnt
quite
fully
ripened
yet
its
not
bad
and
still
above
average
because
the
carbonation
level
is
perfect
and
theres
no
alcohol
bite
at
all
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
not
quite
sure
how
its
considered
a
winter
or
fall
seasonal
i
could
certainly
drink
this
all
year
round
but
its
nice
to
see
some
hoppy
styles
come
out
and
join
the
party
in
the
colder
weather
cheers
d
a
little
bitter
for
a
session
beer
in
my
mind
but
nice
to
have
a
few
of
so
glad
to
see
a
wellbalanced
amber
like
this
dawn
the
shelves
here
in
mn
and
by
magic
hat
no
less
hope
it
sticks
around
as
this
will
be
consumed
quickly
upon
purchase
overall
a
solid
offering
from
magic
hat
nothing
spectacular
but
definitely
makes
me
wonder
about
their
other
brews
i
found
this
heavy
and
not
super
quaffable
but
its
got
some
good
things
going
reminds
me
a
bit
of
surly
furious
not
as
high
of
a
compliment
as
it
seems
as
i
find
furious
to
have
the
same
sort
of
onedimensional
bitterness
and
undefined
malt
character
borderline
ipa
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
dark
warm
barely
translucent
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
malty
and
surprisingly
hoppy
with
hints
of
yeast
and
cinnamon
flavor
is
strongly
hoppy
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
amber
ale
with
a
malty
undertone
and
a
touch
of
spice
smooth
tingly
texture
leaves
a
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
finish
this
is
easily
my
favorite
beer
from
magic
hat
lots
of
great
hops
with
a
very
nice
malt
backing
this
would
be
a
great
imperial
red
ale
if
they
kicked
it
up
a
notch
or
two
highly
recommended
if
you
like
red
ales
andor
magic
hat
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
of
the
better
from
magic
hat
very
drinkable
overall
just
the
thing
for
a
good
autumn
seasonal
id
say
an
excellent
red
ale
has
just
enough
sweetness
to
cut
through
the
hops
but
still
maintain
the
perfect
balance
of
flavors
wonderful
fall
seasonal
beer
one
of
the
best
out
there
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
magic
hat
overall
off
the
bat
this
is
ranked
second
in
my
list
of
magics
best
offerings
that
ive
had
it
is
perfect
for
the
season
and
im
so
glad
they
moved
it
to
autumn
instead
of
holding
out
for
winter
sad
to
see
jinx
go
as
the
autumnal
brew
but
this
one
holds
its
own
in
the
lineup
when
paired
with
a
hearty
chili
or
any
other
meaty
and
spicy
dish
this
really
opened
up
and
complimented
it
and
also
developed
an
almost
chocolateesq
creamy
sweetness
to
the
malt
this
can
be
seen
as
magics
attempt
at
making
arrogant
bastards
long
lost
little
brother
not
overwhelming
but
looks
up
to
it
with
admiration
i
really
liked
certain
aspects
of
the
beer
it
has
a
good
appearance
despite
chill
haze
it
cleared
up
as
the
beer
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
perfect
and
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
even
got
better
as
it
warmed
but
i
dont
necessarily
think
the
malty
and
hoppy
aspects
blended
that
well
together
if
you
like
beers
that
have
a
very
hoppy
presence
this
one
is
for
you
otherwise
might
want
to
stay
away
from
this
one
awesome
beer
i
really
liked
this
one
i
almost
wish
it
wasnt
seasonal
d
as
a
stand
alone
or
a
session
beer
this
one
could
cover
all
the
bases
im
keeping
this
one
on
a
list
i
just
hope
it
can
be
found
outside
of
the
few
months
of
fall
d
very
very
tasty
keep
em
coming
this
beer
has
brought
magic
hat
back
into
focus
for
me
and
if
they
continue
to
produce
this
beer
i
will
continue
to
proclaim
its
greatness
from
the
mountaintops
a
worldclass
beer
i
am
blown
away
extremely
pleasant
and
drinkable
d
i
dont
like
magic
hat
in
general
but
i
like
roxy
rolles
a
lot
the
cloudy
appearance
and
crisp
nutty
flavor
are
what
set
it
apart
d
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
fresh
hoppy
amber
ale
as
thats
what
i
was
promised
this
is
super
malty
and
actually
a
bit
hard
to
finish
but
i
bought
a
6er
and
i
will
drink
the
rest
very
very
nice
i
wish
i
had
more
than
the
one
i
picked
up
will
definitely
seek
out
more
d
another
enjoyable
beer
by
magic
hat
the
abv
is
just
about
right
you
could
enjoy
this
all
evening
the
mouthfeel
is
again
in
the
ipa
family
if
you
ask
me
there
is
a
firm
bitterness
and
a
mostly
hoppy
aftertaste
im
not
sure
exactly
what
makes
this
a
seasonal
autumn
beer
but
it
sure
is
nice
to
drink
lightly
carbonated
and
a
little
dry
but
all
in
all
a
great
brew
overall
good
balance
between
malt
and
hop
flavors
enjoyable
but
lacking
in
the
typical
caramel
richness
of
flavor
smell
is
a
citrus
up
front
with
s
malt
sweetness
and
fruitiness
following
caramel
sweetness
and
citrus
hops
are
balanced
up
front
some
toasted
grain
and
tootsie
roll
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
really
nice
i
will
definitely
get
again
before
autumn
is
over
d
this
beer
is
very
very
bitter
and
hoppy
if
thats
what
you
like
buy
it
its
a
little
to
overwelming
for
me
i
dont
know
what
the
ibu
rating
is
but
imo
its
more
bitter
than
hop
stoopid
which
says
102ibu
right
on
the
bottle
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
i
wont
buy
it
again
im
finding
that
i
am
starting
to
stray
from
liking
ambers
and
this
is
definatly
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
suds
heavy
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
in
west
coast
fashion
moderately
bitter
flavor
citrus
hops
at
first
dominate
the
flavor
but
has
a
minerally
flavor
that
is
a
bit
distracting
and
to
me
at
least
not
appealling
has
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
finish
but
then
it
is
gone
medium
body
and
nicely
carbonated
a
nice
hoppy
amber
but
the
mineral
charactor
wore
on
me
after
awhile
cheers
to
magic
hat
poured
from
a
chilled
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
dark
amber
color
and
the
head
is
about
one
finger
thick
and
is
made
up
of
tan
foam
with
some
larger
bubbles
mixed
in
there
is
a
strong
inviting
floral
aroma
the
taste
is
mostly
grassy
bitter
hops
that
linger
on
slightly
after
you
swallow
there
is
also
some
malty
sweetness
present
but
it
is
minor
and
doesnt
detract
from
the
hoppiness
there
is
an
average
body
to
this
beer
and
has
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
call
attention
to
itself
it
has
a
high
level
of
quality
that
you
can
easily
take
for
granted
when
drinking
craft
beers
i
find
this
beer
to
be
extremely
drinkable
i
cant
identify
anything
in
this
beer
that
would
make
want
to
stop
ordering
it
the
slight
tart
note
kind
of
make
this
hard
to
session
even
though
i
love
sour
beers
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
ill
reach
for
a
lot
rotation
one
and
done
as
better
out
there
no
on
tap
unless
only
real
choice
d
pretty
good
a
very
friendly
amber
ale
tame
and
still
extremely
delicious
highly
recommended
amber
ale
but
great
beer
nonetheless
d
quite
nice
mild
red
ale
that
i
would
not
mind
at
all
having
again
drinkability
is
very
good
esp
when
compared
to
other
thick
monsters
such
as
cascazilla
and
nugget
nectar
both
of
which
i
am
crazy
forthat
are
also
included
in
this
style
d
i
could
probably
drink
about
4
of
these
before
it
gets
old
very
good
beer
i
cant
believe
ive
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
big
malt
character
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
some
piney
hops
at
the
end
the
taste
is
big
and
flavorful
big
roasted
malt
backbone
with
caramel
tones
mid
way
there
is
a
piney
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
above
average
but
not
good
due
to
how
big
the
flavor
is
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
alot
of
these
overall
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
for
a
red
the
taste
is
complex
full
and
bold
d
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
this
inexpensive
and
low
abv
beer
i
havnt
been
too
impressed
with
magic
hat
so
far
but
this
is
something
i
really
got
into
check
it
out
this
is
a
fine
rich
red
amber
beer
with
a
bit
more
hops
than
most
red
ambers
a
fine
specimen
good
to
jumpstart
your
evening
but
youll
probably
want
to
end
up
with
something
a
bit
lighter
as
a
night
cap
the
first
sip
of
this
hoppy
autumn
amber
is
just
packed
full
of
hops
but
thankfully
it
gives
way
to
a
more
mellow
but
full
bodied
redamber
very
quickly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hops
but
this
beer
smells
so
great
that
i
was
willing
to
try
it
anyways
it
is
like
a
mellower
version
of
lagunitas
limited
release
red
ale
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
one
of
the
more
solid
brews
i
have
tried
from
mh
i
should
qualify
this
review
by
saying
that
maybe
i
just
had
a
bad
batch
or
my
home
refrigerator
might
have
been
set
too
cold
and
thereby
ruined
the
beer
it
didnt
taste
like
how
i
recall
it
in
the
3
or
4
previous
years
versions
d
very
high
good
session
brew
that
pairs
with
any
food
imaginable
magic
hat
roxy
rolles
is
a
dim
deep
reddish
amber
ale
with
a
huge
frothy
rocky
creamy
yellowtan
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
looks
superb
it
has
a
very
grassy
aroma
yes
it
smells
like
grass
and
hay
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
the
finish
is
a
little
watery
it
tastes
like
grassy
hops
theres
not
too
much
malt
flavor
and
its
a
tid
bit
astringent
theres
not
too
much
going
on
but
at
least
its
bitter
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
a
clipped
off
date
of
feb
09
sampled
on
august
9
2009
so
this
was
a
bit
past
expiration
date
the
pour
is
an
opaque
amberred
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
has
the
look
of
a
milk
shake
head
the
aroma
is
well
hopped
and
crisp
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
to
bold
the
taste
is
full
of
very
bitter
hops
and
slight
sweetness
not
hoppy
like
an
ipa
but
hoppy
all
the
same
for
its
style
it
is
excellent
but
it
is
not
really
my
style
d
full
flavored
and
decent
body
makes
this
very
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
i
wish
they
had
this
year
round
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
yielded
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
a
pretty
wellbalanced
taste
yielded
a
nice
drinking
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
brews
pours
a
transparent
amber
biscuity
thick
head
like
you
could
float
a
quarter
on
it
smell
was
that
of
diminished
hops
not
quite
fresh
but
unmistakeably
rustic
taste
was
again
slightly
old
hops
little
bit
of
biscuity
malt
sweetness
my
bottle
is
from
the
winter
so
its
a
little
old
but
ive
had
it
fresh
and
its
just
lost
a
bit
of
a
step
mouthfeel
isnt
impressive
at
all
thin
and
stale
i
think
its
a
decent
attempt
at
a
hoppy
amber
but
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
stretch
poured
from
a
1
2ounce
bottle
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
appears
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
lingering
foam
leaves
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
mildly
toasted
grains
rich
caramel
malts
and
grapefruit
pith
caramel
coated
grapefruit
peel
toasted
bread
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
md
light
bodied
and
a
nice
hop
twinge
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
have
several
of
pours
an
almost
bright
amber
red
nice
head
after
that
leaves
a
film
and
some
lacing
and
good
bubbling
smells
of
dry
breadsome
toasted
dme
and
a
good
amount
of
yakima
valley
hops
lots
of
open
valley
citrus
hops
upfront
the
middle
into
the
finish
has
some
lame
dme
toasted
malts
the
palate
is
bitter
overall
and
lacks
some
needed
balance
d
this
beer
is
an
interesting
study
in
balance
at
first
the
flavors
seem
to
be
at
odds
but
in
the
end
it
all
comes
together
well
i
find
this
to
be
a
highly
drinkable
solid
offering
from
magic
hat
my
favorite
from
them
so
far
d
this
is
my
favorite
magic
hat
beer
that
i
have
sampled
so
far
a
nice
red
that
i
could
easily
drink
a
pint
or
two
of
future
outlook
quite
a
bit
better
than
i
was
anticipating
id
be
happy
to
pick
this
up
again
during
the
summer
this
beer
poured
a
dark
hazy
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
twofinger
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
biscuity
malt
with
a
some
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
bready
malt
that
gives
way
almost
immediately
to
hops
that
shift
from
citrus
to
a
bit
of
pininess
that
clears
up
by
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
subdued
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
hops
are
balanced
well
probably
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
beers
ive
had
ive
been
on
the
fence
for
quite
a
while
with
magic
hat
i
am
not
often
impressed
with
their
beer
roxy
rolles
is
a
very
nice
exception
while
it
falls
short
of
excellence
it
is
very
good
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
in
some
ways
it
reminds
me
nugget
nectar
and
the
comparison
seems
natural
but
that
comparison
reveals
what
id
truly
like
to
see
in
this
beer
a
little
more
body
hops
and
alcohol
would
take
roxy
rolles
pretty
far
that
being
said
its
easily
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
magic
hat
12
ounce
bottle
best
by
march
2009
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amberbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
mostly
citrusy
and
pine
hops
along
with
a
bit
of
biscuity
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
caramel
malt
i
can
taste
in
the
brew
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
im
not
a
fan
of
most
magic
hat
products
that
ive
tried
but
i
have
to
give
credit
where
its
due
and
this
is
a
good
brew
that
id
pick
up
again
and
with
a
5
1
abv
its
a
good
choice
as
a
session
beer
too
i
have
been
nursing
one
of
these
for
over
15
minutes
and
it
is
still
showing
a
full
quarterinch
of
head
and
it
has
the
kind
of
chewiness
that
one
would
expect
from
a
beer
that
had
twice
as
much
abv
well
done
indeed
not
sure
id
have
multiple
in
a
row
but
the
final
verdict
on
this
beer
is
tasty
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
good
winter
ale
for
those
who
like
heavily
hopped
ales
drinkability
is
fantastic
slightly
cloudy
amber
ale
hops
dominate
the
aroma
but
there
is
some
malty
sweetness
hops
dominate
the
taste
as
well
but
they
do
not
punch
you
in
the
face
the
beer
is
somewhat
thin
and
onedimensional
beyond
the
hops
i
dont
taste
much
else
a
lttle
caramel
but
not
much
more
notes
overall
it
is
a
very
solid
brew
and
quite
enjoyable
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
seem
like
an
amber
ale
to
me
is
the
color
otherwise
itd
be
any
other
ipa
for
me
all
of
the
other
amber
ales
i
have
ever
had
have
much
more
malt
characteristic
that
this
only
seems
to
have
in
color
alone
d
im
not
a
big
magic
hat
fan
so
it
was
with
some
reluctance
that
i
ordered
this
one
wow
just
a
great
brew
definitely
one
i
would
seek
out
again
about
as
drinkable
as
a
standard
ipa
i
like
this
beer
because
it
is
hoppy
but
doesnt
taste
like
an
ipa
definitely
a
good
beer
try
it
drinkabilitly
good
amber
that
goes
down
easily
could
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
without
a
problem
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
didnt
remember
it
being
so
blah
but
hey
i
have
developed
a
much
greater
appreciation
for
craft
brews
so
maybe
my
palate
has
evolved
and
i
now
expect
more
from
a
hoppy
amber
ale
it
didnt
quite
meet
my
expectations
so
i
couldnt
rate
it
any
higher
another
good
brew
by
magic
hat
i
really
like
this
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
magic
hat
offerings
recommend
d
the
balanced
flavor
and
low
abv
make
this
a
easy
drinker
that
i
could
enjoy
all
night
probably
the
best
offering
from
magic
hat
that
ive
had
beer
poured
a
pretty
amber
with
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
that
was
short
lived
smelled
hoppy
possibly
simcoe
not
sure
also
could
detect
malt
aromas
some
caramel
tast
was
good
with
a
nice
bitterness
tasted
grapefruit
rind
like
hops
and
a
nice
balancing
malt
beer
was
nicely
carbonated
and
is
medium
bodied
definitely
could
see
muyself
having
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
it
tastes
good
but
its
ultimately
not
a
very
sessionable
beer
for
me
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beers
texture
at
least
not
enough
to
prefer
it
to
other
holiday
options
available
bottle
pour
is
amber
red
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
all
grapefruit
and
pinecones
the
taste
is
an
extremely
balanced
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
citrusy
hops
this
is
very
refreshing
and
easily
sessionable
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
it
is
highly
carbonated
however
it
is
a
nice
beer
i
wonder
why
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
as
it
seems
more
geared
towards
the
summer
d
really
just
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
amber
ale
the
bitterness
is
bigger
than
expected
but
the
malt
complexity
is
limited
about
8
50
a
sixer
this
is
a
pretty
good
rendition
of
a
hoppy
red
ale
smell
and
taste
are
a
little
off
but
somewhat
clean
it
is
pretty
thin
in
the
mouth
but
definitely
drinkable
this
is
a
better
beer
than
several
of
magic
hats
yearround
offerings
dont
think
i
will
revisit
it
unless
its
the
only
thing
left
at
a
party
or
a
friends
fridge
highly
recommend
drinkability
pretty
damned
good
light
in
alcohol
tasty
excellent
head
retention
with
plenty
of
lacing
call
me
a
fan
i
think
its
a
very
nice
drop
d
a
hoppy
amber
that
goes
down
very
easily
d
a
real
nice
brew
from
magic
hat
they
have
been
slipping
in
recent
years
but
this
makes
me
look
forward
to
what
they
are
coming
with
as
you
would
expect
this
pale
ale
has
a
very
bitter
taste
to
it
solid
taste
to
it
nothing
that
really
stands
out
but
a
good
solid
brew
gave
it
a
b
on
my
first
review
on
12209
medium
amber
in
color
thin
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
through
out
the
beer
smells
very
hoppy
more
like
an
ipa
this
beer
tastes
like
a
west
coast
ipa
to
me
with
the
initial
hop
bitterness
slapping
my
tongue
malts
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
excellent
drinkability
for
a
winter
seasonal
as
it
is
not
heavily
spiced
or
high
in
alcohol
content
great
beer
for
football
sundays
normally
only
buy
magic
hat
when
its
the
only
beer
available
supermarkets
local
package
stores
but
this
is
a
beer
of
theirs
that
i
consider
to
be
very
well
crafted
got
this
from
the
magic
hat
winter
sampler
12
pack
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
fairly
cloudy
copper
red
color
the
white
head
is
very
lacy
and
chunky
looking
it
is
a
good
inch
thick
or
maybe
more
when
poured
fantastic
lacing
here
indeed
settles
to
a
good
12
inch
and
eventually
a
solid
14
inch
that
lasts
down
to
the
last
sip
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
and
citrus
hop
aroma
along
with
a
touch
of
coffee
the
taste
is
the
same
along
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
the
sweet
caramel
malt
and
citrus
hops
flavor
balance
each
other
quite
nicely
indeed
i
believe
i
may
also
detect
a
hint
of
clove
and
banana
here
too
very
nice
crisp
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
extremely
easy
to
drink
in
the
way
well
crafted
beers
should
be
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
good
choice
d
considering
it
doesnt
have
a
very
complex
flavor
other
than
on
the
swallow
this
is
a
hoppy
beer
i
could
actually
have
a
few
of
real
hop
fans
are
probably
left
wanting
more
not
overly
carbonated
rich
copper
red
with
a
solid
rocky
head
lots
of
maltiness
waft
out
along
with
a
hint
of
coffee
caramelized
sugars
and
a
touch
of
tobacco
feels
spritzy
with
an
acidic
edge
flavour
leans
towards
the
hops
although
toasted
grains
are
noticeable
some
nuttiness
comes
through
as
well
finishes
dry
with
a
somewhat
bitter
and
quite
husky
aftertaste
easy
to
put
down
a
lot
of
these
but
a
bit
harsh
of
a
harsher
mouthfeel
a
low
alcohol
content
delightful
hop
aroma
balanced
flavor
and
a
finish
that
keeps
asking
for
more
all
combine
to
make
this
a
superb
quaff
and
a
welcome
break
from
the
typical
malty
spicy
winter
brews
highly
recommended
magic
hat
has
surprised
me
with
this
one
i
havent
had
a
beer
from
them
for
a
while
now
as
i
just
havent
been
impressed
lately
maybe
this
will
change
that
well
done
very
drinkable
and
tasty
amber
this
beer
pours
a
an
amberish
color
with
a
nice
sticky
head
great
retention
and
a
wide
array
of
spotty
lace
all
over
the
glass
nose
is
pleasantly
interesting
mostly
of
hops
it
has
slim
air
of
malt
but
heavy
on
pine
taste
matches
the
nose
pretty
well
the
pine
taste
is
definitely
present
but
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
very
textured
with
a
sharp
sudden
but
brief
bitterness
this
beer
goes
down
quite
easily
i
could
definitely
have
this
as
a
session
beer
because
of
the
complexity
of
this
ale
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
only
5
abv
having
said
that
the
strong
flavors
keep
this
one
from
being
a
true
session
ale
very
good
t
excellent
this
is
a
good
brew
pours
a
very
nice
deep
amber
color
with
some
good
head
although
no
lacing
nice
scent
malty
and
deep
with
a
large
hoppy
aroma
same
with
the
taste
although
a
lot
of
the
normal
red
ale
was
covered
up
by
the
hops
hop
characteristics
were
also
odd
but
from
being
in
an
odd
style
or
from
a
mixmatch
im
not
sure
goes
down
pretty
good
though
not
my
favorite
but
i
would
never
turn
one
down
my
wife
pick
this
beer
up
in
akron
ohio
beer
pours
reddish
brown
color
with
a
two
finger
creamy
white
head
smells
of
hops
right
off
citrus
and
pine
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
biscut
and
malty
flavor
at
the
finish
very
smooth
i
really
like
the
way
they
merge
hoppy
seasonal
and
malty
this
beer
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
for
me
and
for
a
good
seasonal
brew
i
think
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
just
wish
i
could
get
it
around
here
a
good
beer
from
start
to
finish
the
nice
hop
flavor
stays
through
the
beer
good
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
flavored
beer
d
a
fairly
easydrinking
amber
ale
with
a
nice
hop
bouquet
im
enjoying
the
mix
of
herbal
and
grassy
hop
notes
a
combination
i
havent
found
in
my
recent
tastings
the
overall
complexity
of
flavors
could
use
some
improvement
and
a
drier
finish
might
improve
drinkability
i
might
order
a
second

not
a
third

beer
i
like
the

good
potential
as

would
definitely
buy
this
beer
againyum
hv
doverall
a
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
drinkability
is
good
i
probably
wouldnt
go
right
to
this
beer
but
would
drink
it
if
i
happened
upon
it
mouthfeel
is
lacking
feels
very
watery
to
me
and
the
carbonation
is
off
medium
bodied
feels
very
light
in
the
mouth
its
drinkable
however
and
is
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
the
relative
smoothness
makes
this
so
utterly
drinkable
although
it
still
has
gritty
chalky
qualities
its
delicious
if
intense
really
bitter
really
woody
a
tad
too
extreme
but
delicious
a
very
steady
performer
one
of
the
few
ambers
that
i
enjoy
drinking
drinkability
for
me
it
was
an
average
beer
with
a
bit
of
extra
bitterness
and
though
i
was
certainly
ready
to
give
my
love
to
this
beer
particularly
as
its
the
season
of
giving
but
well
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
overall
a
surprise
coming
from
a
sampler
recommended
bottle
decants
a
mostly
clear
copper
body
with
a
healthy
offwhite
head
attractive
spiderweb
lacing
is
all
over
the
glass
pleasant
aroma
opens
with
fruity
peach
quickly
followed
by
a
blast
of
spicy
pepper
and
some
toasted
caramel
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
an
earthy
feel
taste
has
some
fruity
peach
and
subtle
caramel
and
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
hops
impart
elements
of
citrus
pine
and
spicy
pepper
rather
exciting
for
an
amber
very
drinkable
this
is
how
i
like
my
red
ales
to
be
they
must
have
a
solid
hop
profile
and
this
one
stands
up
again
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
buy
this
in
the
six
pack
format
this
one
came
in
a
12
pack
variety
mix
not
the
most
complex
of
beers
but
certainly
one
i
could
drink
all
night
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
defines
what
craft
is
all
about
so
kudos
for
that
but
its
not
one
i
want
to
drink
again
however
i
could
see
others
liking
it
this
has
more
hop
flavor
than
i
thought
it
would
there
is
a
citrusy
smell
to
it
it
has
some
pine
flavors
that
linger
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
lot
but
its
walking
a
fine
line
between
being
tasty
and
being
too
bitter
thats
not
a
bad
thing
though
as
its
probably
what
they
were
going
for
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
6pack
before
the
season
is
over
poured
a
murky
copper
with
a
wellcarbonated
onefinger
head
with
sheath
lacing
down
the
entire
glass
a
hint
of
malts
mixed
in
with
mild
peppery
spice
notes
along
with
citrus
in
the
aroma
for
a
red
this
seemed
like
a
hop
bomb
large
citric
hop
base
along
with
spices
in
a
medium
body
produce
a
smooth
yet
really
dry
beer
hints
of
roasted
andor
caramel
malts
add
a
dash
of
sweeetness
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
wish
they
wouldnt
just
make
as
a
seasonal
drinkability
an
easydrinking
amber
ale
the
nice
caramel
malt
adds
a
smoothness
throughout
each
sip
that
pulls
together
the
citrus
flavors
and
hops
relatively
new
to
this
style
of
ale
new
in
a
sense
i
dont
have
it
too
often
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
though
i
feel
as
though
latley
magic
hat
has
been
a
bit
disapointing
with
some
of
the
beers
ive
been
trying
im
still
not
over
blindfaiths
departure
i
found
this
beer
to
have
a
great
look
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
beige
head
that
leaves
some
nice
rings
around
the
glass
for
coming
out
of
a
bottle
the
smell
was
much
hoppier
and
floral
than
i
expected
it
seems
to
have
that
distinct
smell
i
associate
with
magic
hat
the
taste
was
equally
a
nice
suprise
for
a
winter
ale
ive
gotten
accoustomed
to
heavy
malt
based
beer
warmers
this
beer
has
a
great
body
perfect
balance
between
heavy
and
light
the
taste
certainly
seems
to
be
hop
driven
at
first
but
ends
with
a
nice
sweet
buttery
flavor
find
this
beer
to
also
be
a
great
session
beer
light
enough
not
to
be
overly
filling
the
alcohol
seems
to
be
perfect
too
for
a
night
of
roxy
roles
nice
approach
to
a
winter
ale
for
sure
notes
overall
a
very
nice
red
ale
that
has
a
good
balance
to
it
making
it
a
nice
inexpensive
alternative
to
your
standby
winter
brew
doesnt
quite
surpass
ruedrichs
red
seal
ale
imo
but
most
definitely
worth
getting
every
winter
i
had
this
last
winter
as
well
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
even
if
9
has
gone
downhill
lately
magic
hat
isnt
slacking
with
this
one
d
this
is
a
good
seasonal
from
magic
hat
i
will
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
one
before
it
goes
away
until
next
year
bottle
in
trade
from
roborb
thanks
man
pours
a
reddish
orange
hazy
color
with
a
short
to
medium
lived
beige
head
smell
is
rye
like
zesty
malts
with
a
spicy
fresh
earthiness
to
the
hops
taste
is
a
dull
rye
and
caramel
like
sweetness
with
earthy
dry
hoppiness
some
grapefruit
like
flavor
too
moderately
smooth
with
a
light
lingering
bitterness
not
really
an
amber
but
still
nice
medium
bodied
with
normal
carbonation
a
level
pretty
solid
beer
overall
pretty
bitter
and
a
bit
of
a
heavy
drop
into
the
stomach
ive
certainly
had
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
before
but
it
lacks
drinkability
as
most
hoppy
beers
do
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
seasonal
from
magic
hat
nothing
over
the
top
but
solid
character
i
like
this
one
easy
to
drink
but
certainly
not
pedestrian
not
the
best
magic
hat
ive
had
but
a
pretty
good
one
a
little
harsh
and
bitter
for
me
the
bitterness
and
strength
of
the
hops
could
have
been
better
balanced
by
the
underlying
flavors
having
trouble
distinguishing
what
else
was
in
there
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
have
liked
a
beautiful
red
amber
color
and
off
white
head
pretty
good
after
taste
drinkability
as
all
of
magic
hats
brews
are
as
a
result
of
vermont
laws
i
imagine
this
ones
low
in
alcohol
and
quite
sessionable
as
a
result
its
just
a
solid
allaround
earthy
hoppy
amber
and
though
its
not
my
favorite
hoppy
amber
its
no
nugget
nectar
its
a
good
beer
the
drinkability
was
off
the
charts
last
year
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
but
this
year
my
palate
is
developed
enough
to
really
enjoy
it
if
you
like
fresh
hoppy
beers
this
is
a
must
try
got
this
in
a
mixed
winter
pack
from
magic
hat
poured
amber
with
a
reddishorange
tint
and
a
pretty
short
head
that
sticsk
around
as
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
smells
malty
with
a
bit
of
red
fruit
and
then
the
hit
of
citrusy
hops
pretty
much
as
billed
a
hoppy
red
ale
the
taste
as
well
is
quite
fruity
both
from
the
red
ale
grain
bill
and
from
the
citrusy
hops
smooth
and
slightly
grainy
and
with
a
gentle
but
sustained
bitterness
this
is
a
little
bit
different
and
i
find
i
like
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
think
the
cereal
grain
sweetness
and
the
citrusy
hops
work
pretty
well
together
giving
the
beer
a
bit
of
candied
grapefruit
peel
flavor
and
a
touch
of
raspberry
like
sweetness
gentle
and
pleasing
this
works
well
as
a
winter
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint

the
colour
is
a
beautiful
deep
copper
poured
from
the
bottle
to
the
tulip
glass
with
a
weak

that
disappeared
quickly
a
sweet
malty
flavour
to
the
taste

a
pinelike

this
one
was
nice
to
taste
but
probably
not
be
in

collection
for
me
drinkability
is
decent
not
as
easy
to
knock
out
as
the
hipa
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
for
me
more
of
a
hotweathermakemeforgetaboutitwiththishugetaste
kind
of
thing
a
well
put
together
beer
just
not
my
favorite
bottle
dated
may
2008
right
on
par
for
the
style
not
overly
hopped
where
it
would
take
its
toll
on
the
tastebuds
but
a
very
satisfying
amber
ever
so
hoppy
wonderfully
so
feels
a
bit
lighter
then
most
beers
with
a
hop
taste
of
this
caliber
but
the
tastes
is
bold
of
hops
pine
biscuits
and
citrus
smell
is
of
pine
and
hops
simply
is
amazing
at
5
80abv
and
a
taste
like
this
id
say
its
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
think
arrogant
bastards
little
brother
and
your
on
the
right
track
one
of
magic
hats
best
imho
very
tasty
a
bit
like
nugget
nectar
but
more
malt
and
less
hops
probably
a
more
balanced
amber
but
not
as
good
as
the
nugget
imo
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
wellbalanced
tasty
a
good
brew
a
rosey
clear
copper
color
with
a
big
tan
head
and
heavy
lace
the
aroma
is
just
big
grapefruit
hops
with
an
interesting
sweet
bread
touch
very
nice
this
has
a
wonderfully
full
feel
and
delivers
all
the
citrus
hops
that
the
aroma
promised
just
solid
with
even
carbonation
and
tinges
of
spicey
sweetness
complex
but
rooted
in
the
hops
bitterness
although
it
does
not
overload
or
hide
the
full
flavor
that
you
can
sink
your
teeth
into
plenty
drinkable
for
such
a
hoppy
brew
another
magic
hat
masterpiece
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
lace
of
head
smell
has
hoppy
aromas
and
quite
fruity
also
taste
is
quite
hoppy
but
has
lots
of
malts
to
smooth
it
out
too
mouthfeel
is
quite
tingly
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
bitter
this
is
one
excellent
beer
probably
a
little
hoppier
than
you
might
expect
but
otherwise
tasty
overall
a
very
drinkable
offering
from
magic
hat
one
of
the
better
brews
to
be
released
from
them
in
the
last
few
years
in
my
humble
opinion
drinkability
not
being
a
big
fan
of
ambers
and
having
been
disappointed
by
more
than
one
magic
hat
brews
i
didnt
think
i
would
be
at
all
excited
by
this
beer
boy
was
i
wrong
very
nice
effort
and
one
of
the
best
ambers
out
there
overall
a
great
beer
for
magic
hat
the
pour
was
a
brilliant
amber
red
with
a
nice
two
finger
lacy
head
with
great
head
retention
to
follow
the
hop
aroma
was
very
pungent
with
notes
of
caramel
and
oranges
the
taste
was
nice
a
great
balance
of
hops
citrus
flavors
and
yeastdough
it
is
a
hop
dominant
beer
but
the
other
flavors
make
for
a
interesting
mix
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
and
a
great
seasonal
highly
drinkable
and
great
tasting
well
this
is
probably
the
best
thing
in
the
mardi
gras
sampler
appearance
was
great
dark
amber
red
with
eventual
solid
lacing
from
its
big
head
the
aromas
are
sharp
malts
and
hops
mixed
wonderfully
together
some
fruity
smells
as
well
were
sensed
the
taste
is
wicked
malty
and
bitter
but
there
is
a
sweet
aftertaste
from
a
pure
sugarishtaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
weak
but
it
helps
in
making
the
drinks
malty
flavors
more
apparent
instead
of
a
carbonation
overall
definitely
the
best
thing
i
have
had
from
magic
hat
note
the
hops
were
not
too
bitter
and
i
lovedloved
this
beer
the
smellthe
feel
and
the
taste
was
spectacular
i
am
not
a
fan
of
ipas
yet
this
was
so
well
balanced
i
could
not
resist
very
well
crafted
pours
deep
redamber
not
surprisingly
decent
head
smells
real
hoppy
with
some
big
juicy
grapefruit
grapefruity
hops
in
the
taste
too
though
with
a
marked
destinction
from
that
of
cascades
simcoes
have
this
kind
of
asprinyhard
candy
like
sweetness
that
i
dont
always
enjoy
but
magic
hat
definitely
pulls
it
off
this
is
just
as
much
an
ipa
as
a
red
ale
in
terms
of
the
monstrous
hop
profile
pretty
bitter
though
enjoyably
nothing
too
amazing
in
the
mouthfeel
but
nice
smooth
at
the
least
i
could
definitely
drink
a
bunch
of
these
its
not
really
the
most
standout
hoppy
red
ale
in
a
store
full
of
ipas
id
probably
go
with
something
else
nevertheless
its
still
a
solid
brew
this
beer
definitely
satisfies
cravings
as
a
hophead
and
im
glad
to
have
it
thanks
johnnnnieeill
look
out
for
more
magic
hat
offerings
in
the
future
impressive
beer
especially
since
i
am
usually
suspect
of
amber
ales
because
of
their
cronic
under
hopped
rated
and
oversparged
grain
flavors
this
beer
does
not
fall
into
either
catagory
giving
a
bold
pine
citrus
hop
flavor
substantial
bitterness
and
a
strong
pine
nose
the
malts
are
equally
as
bold
providing
a
strong

for
the
hops
without

the

of

it

can
you

give

a

the
difference
its
there

mix
of

agree
with
other
reviews
that
the
taste
is
more
of
the

quality
amber
ale
malt
with
a
little
sweetness
and
just
the
right
amount
of
finishing

to
give
it
a
unique
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
bite

carbonation

with
the
moderate

this
is
def
a
brew
i
could
session
just
a
high
quality
amber
ale
with
the
extra
hops
that
set
it
apart
a
fairly
nice
beer
magic
hat
is
hit
or
miss
and
this
is
no
home
run
but
a
solid
base
hit
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
copperyred
color
with
a
brown
tint
in
the
background
thick
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
strong
presence
of
apricots
immediately
fill
the
nostrils
as
well
as
some
citrus
fruit
grapefruit
and
a
subtle
hoppyfloral
presence
taste
similar
to
nose
with
apricot
flavor
much
more
mellowed
in
the
mouth
citrus
astringency
is
much
more
pronounced
as
is
the
hops
bite
at
the
end
lively
tingly
mouthfeel
leaves
a
crisp
feeling
in
the
mouth
between
sips
this
is
an
excellent
offering
from
mh
and
makes
a
great
session
brew
i
was
particularly
impressed
as
i
dont
normally
drink
hoppy
brews
magic
hat
can
let
me
down
at
times
but
they
can
still
bring
it
with
many
of
their
brews
and
certainly
with
this
one
its
great
to
still
have
it
around
as
a
seasonal
but
id
love
to
see
it
turn
into
a
year
round
brew
definitely
a
solid
brew
from
magic
hat
d
a
solid
choice
one
of
the
more
flavorful
amberred
ales
ive
tried
one
id
probably
have
again
though
i
like
mine
a
little
more
on
the
maltysweet
side
big
thanks
jeff
thanks
to
will
fill
in
blank
when
i
find
out
for
the
extra
got
this
one
in
a
make
your
own
sixer
at
trader
joes
pours
a
nice
looking
deep
purply
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
a
good
bit
of
nice
looking
lacing
nose
is
fairly
mild
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
slightly
roasted
malt
taste
is
really
tasty
nice
almost
grapy
fruitiness
in
the
hops
with
solid
caramel
dirty
malt
flavor
a
nice
surprise
body
is
good
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
one
was
really
a
tasty
treat
im
usually
fairly
soso
on
magic
hat
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
of
theirs
ive
tried
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
beers
i
tasted
tonight
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
was
rather
enjoyable
recommended
for
all
the
hopheads
out
there
bought
this
as
part
of
the
mardi
gras
12
pack
poured
into
an
official
magic
hat
glass
the
beer
had
about
a
half
inch
of
dark
creamy
head
with
a
lot
of
lacing
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
ruddy
dark
red
with
almost
an
orange
hue
to
it
and
no
little
bubbles
floating
up
definitely
the
appearance
of
a
dark
red
ale
i
smell
a
lot
of
grapefruity
hops
coming
off
this
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
ok
im
not
a
huge
hop
fan
though
theres
definitely
a
lot
of
deep
complex
flavor
to
this
beer
my
first
senses
are
the
grapefruit
at
the
top
of
the
tongue
as
i
hold
it
in
my
mouth
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
and
carbonation
wash
that
taste
away
all
thats
left
is
a
lightly
bitter
flavor
in
my
mouth
there
seems
to
be
an
almost
acidic
bite
to
the
beer
its
very
much
a
sipping
type
beer
since
it
seems
higher
in
alcohol
than
it
is
to
me
this
beer
is
a
little
overbearing
in
hops
id
prefer
a
less
harsh
beer
than
this
in
this
type
of
style
like
hopback
with
a
winter
coat
on
mmmm
the
beer
poured
into
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
persisted
barely
and
left
a
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
it
smelled
distinctly
of
hops
i
knew
i
was
in
for
a
good
beer
the
taste
was
a
delightful
and
lively
balance
between
citrus
hops
malt
and
wild
yeast
they
managed
to
pack
in
a
lot
of
flavor
and
keep
it
well
balanced
in
this
very
drinkable
brew
bravo
serving
this
one
cold
after
any
easy
pour
a
smooth
soft
offwhite
head
formed
to
a
quarter
inch
this
quickly
settled
and
revealed
a
hazy
amber
to
light
brown
beverage
herbal
and
floral
hops
are
present
up
front
on
the
nose
and
with
it
a
generous
hit
of
toasted
malty
goodness
it
really
has
an
appealing
smell
and
then
there
is
the
taste
smooth
medium
bodied
and
well
balanced
this
beer
does
not
come
off
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
some
great
toffee
flavors
combine
well
with
the
citrusy
american
hops
found
this
one
to
be
very
delicious
and
worth
buying
a
case
of
happened
to
be
having
a
very
garlicky
chicken
soup
while
downing
a
few
of
these
and
it
paired
well
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
excellent
lacing
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
rich
yeasty
aromas
taste
is
hops
hops
hops
throughout
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
above
average
the
dry
quality
adding
to
th
eoverall
rating
d
good
enough
the
flavour
could
start
to
seem
a
little
overwhelming
after
perhaps
3
or
4
but
i
would
drink
it
until
it
reached
that
point
without
complaint
comparable
to
clipper
citys
small
craft
recommended
not
acceptable
the
aroma
is
nice
but
the
taste
is
horrible
down
the
drain
this
one
goes
i
have
to
give
magic
hat
kudos
for
being
singlehandedly
the
worst
brewery
ive
experienced
in
the
last
5
years
would
probably
find
this
in
regular
rotation
if
it
were
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
and
i
have
to
say
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
another
great
offering
from
magic
hat
smooth
with
decent
carbonation
that
gives
a
little
kick
and
enhances
the
hop
although
at
the
expense
of
malt
balance
this
one
set
up
well
for
me
but
seemed
to
dissapoint
in
the
end
maybe
it
will
appeal
to
someone
else
but
it
didnt
do
it
for
me
pours
a
nice
red
amber
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
it
has
a
nice
floral
hoppy
aroma
that
really
gives
it
a
nice
smell
the
taste
is
good
with
a
sweet
malty
base
followed
by
a
wallop
of
hops
in
the
end
it
is
a
nice
bitter
beer
that
is
great
for
a
red
ale
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
red
ale
worth
a
try
on
this
one
this
is
a
very
tasty
well
balanced
beer
its
not
extremely
bitter
and
the
hops
are
quite
tasty
d
this
is
a
great
red
ale
very
balanced
and
very
tasty
props
to
magic
hat
on
this
one
hope
they
keep
it
up
d
not
too
overpowering
while
still
flavorful
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
changing
any
of
the
enjoyment
from
the
first
one
overall
it
was
a
nice
switch
from
spiced
or
malty
winter
brews
im
a
little
concerned
with
the
trend
of
hop
loading
every
style
of
beer
though
t
recently
having
had
a
nugget
nectar
i
cant
help
comparing
the
two
this
is
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
the
bitterness
from
hops
is
much
more
present
and
this
beer
is
not
as
sweet
as
nn
sweetness
from
citrus
fruit
but
not
tart
from
start
to
finish
its
the
hops
in
this
that
dominate
the
taste
for
me
like
the
smell
there
is
a
slightly
unpleasant
taste
of
alcohol
for
me
that
keeps
me
from
rating
this
higher
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
magic
hat
but
i
would
still
take
nn
over
this
any
day
regardless
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
would
get
this
again
pours
a
cloudy
brownamber
decent
off
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
down
to
a
thin
ring
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
smell
is
nice
very
sweet
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
pine
and
grapefruit
very
fruity
quite
a
complex
nose
lots
of
aroma
taste
is
nice
as
well
spicy
bready
malt
wheat
some
pine
grapefruit
nice
and
easy
to
drink
lacks
punch
though
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
enough
to
be
interesting
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
nice
head
working
down
to
some
really
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
light
caramel
grass
and
a
good
whack
of
piny
hops
the
taste
features
some
grainy
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hop
flavors
with
some
earthy
notes
and
a
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
good
for
a
session
brew
and
so
is
the
drinkability
i
was
not
sold
on
this
beer
last
year
but
i
have
grown
to
really
appreciate
it
this
season
magic
hat
needs
to
put
this
in
their
mix
packs
and
do
away
with
circus
boy
d
ive
had
ups
and
down
with
magic
hat
all
their
flagship
beers
scored
pretty
low
with
me
but
the
hopped
up
ones
hipa
this
here
roxy
rolles
shows
me
that
the
department
that
matters
most
is
receiving
the
attention
that
it
deserves
a
surprisingly
refreshing
take
on
what
can
be
a
somewhat
bland
genre
amber
ales
this
beer
combines
the
citrus
and
flowery
american
hops
with
a
sturdy
spice
profile
to
create
a
fauxwinterapa
the
malt
balances
out
the
flavor
of
the
beer
nicely
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
but
overall
fitting
this
is
an
enjoyable
seasonal
and
nice
change
of
pace
overall
its
a
bit
too
unique
for
me
to
drink
often
very
enjoyable
but
could
never
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
the
packaging
is
very
cool
with
roxy
rolles
coming
straight
at
you
on
her
harley
a
winter
amber
ramble
of
sweet
caramelized
malt
and
spicy
hops
for
those
who
make
their
own
road
is
written
on
the
6pack
container
the
beer
pours
reddish
amber
and
hazy
the
head
is
sticky
goodness
aroma
is
skunk
weed
and
aromatic
orange
citrus
fruits
such
as
mandarins
and
clementines
sweet
malt
and
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
are
in
the
background
taste
is
explosive
and
includes
the
aforementioned
wet
cannabis
and
citrus
as
well
as
a
strong
foundation
of
sweet
and
sticky
candied
malt
and
a
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
canned
peach
dried
apricot
range
a
fine
bubble
ale
carbonation
makes
this
brew
go
down
very
easy
and
i
dont
think
i
will
be
the
first
to
sayi
wish
it
was
a
year
round
offering
or
i
hope
this
beer
isnt
affected
by
the
hop
shortage
keep
on
rolling
roxy
drinkablility
is
outstanding
though
not
extensively
fascinating
nor
quenching
of
extreme
hop
lovers
masochistic
tendencies
i
find
this
quite
satisfying
in
a
non
overwhelming
way
beer
to
drink
with
dinner
not
for
dinner
i
like
to
cook
and
find
that
overly
agressive
beers
are
hard
to
enjoy
with
food
this
one
is
not
big
hit
on
homemade
pizza
night
d
not
a
session
brew
but
a
good
departure
from
the
norm
it
is
for
sure
worth
a
try
and
a
good
selection
from
magic
hat
as
far
as
im
concerned
only
the
outstanding
thumbsucker
can
compete
with
this
offering
when
it
comes
to
magic
hat
beer
roxy
rolles
is
an
inspired
creation
that
was
built
with
the
simcoeloving
hophead
in
mind
if
i
had
access
this
would
be
a
winter
case
beer
for
sure
overall
a
very
decent
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
one
alot
i
am
a
hop
head
so
this
one
really
does
me
right
i
cannot
wait
to
pick
up
more
of
this
stuff
thanks
to
ineedabeerhere
for
trading
with
me
and
allowing
me
to
try
this
the
beer
poured
a
rather
hazy
reddish
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thick
12
inch
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
citrusy
hops
the
initial
taste
was
of
lots
of
upfront
hop
flavor
dissipating
to
a
smooth
hop
bitterness
on
the
sides
and
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
freshlybaked
bread
aftertaste
the
hop
bitterness
dissipated
rather
quickly
just
in
time
for
another
mouthful
lacing
was
thick
down
the
side
of
the
glass
pretty
hoppy
for
a
red
ale
but
very
drinkable
had
to
take
points
off
for
the
cloudy
appearance
of
the
beer
but
besides
that
a
very
enjoyable
brew
pours
deep
ruby
amber
chill
haze
decent
head
but
dissipates
pretty
quickly
nose
is
hoppy
citrus
flavoring
some
sweet
malty
bread
as
well
labeled
as
a
hoppy
amber
it
delivers
as
advertised
seems
like
it
is
loaded
with
cascade
hops
my
guess
almost
like
an
ipa
with
a
heavy
citrus
hop
and
dry
aftertaste
but
there
are
definite
malty
and
nutty
undertones
that
balance
out
the
hops
with
some
caramel
as
well
reminding
you
of
its
amber
foundation
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
full
and
slick
chewy
i
liked
the
balance
of
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
id
get
it
again
d
a
decent
brew
could
be
smoother
otherwise
a
decent
brew
cheers
i
thought
this
brew
was
ok
and
it
made
a
better
pale
ale
then
anything
else
the
combination
of
the
other
characteristics
didnt
shine
through
like
i
was
expecting
though
hoppy
amber
ale
or
american
winter
warmer
it
has
a
bit
of
a
northwest
flare
but
still
holding
on
to
the
magic
hat
traits
either
way
i
highly
recommend
this
drinkable
ale
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
12
oz
bottle
deep
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissolves
into
a
cloudy
haze
that
remains
throughout
berrylike
hop
aroma
hits
the
nose
hard
tastes
like
a
sweeter
version
of
ithacas
cascazilla
fairly
well
balanced
for
a
hopped
up
ale
overall
impression
a
christmas
beer
like
sierra
nevadas
celebration
which
is
to
say
not
a
traditional
approach
but
very
festive
and
enjoyable
massive
hop
taste
without
much
bitter
a
very
enjoyable
brew
another
unique
beer
put
out
by
magic
hat
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
whitetan
thick
head
that
quickly
dissapates
the
aroma
is
interesting
floral
citrus
hops
with
an
apricot
fruitiness
that
balances
the
hop
aroma
in
the
flavor
the
hops
are
more
pronounce
leaning
toward
the
citrus
side
with
the
apricot
flavor
in
the
background
creamy
mouthfeel
with
midlevel
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
a
typical
amber
ale
but
i
think
what
makes
it
different
makes
it
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
magic
hat
makes
better
not
too
strong
amongst
the
holiday
brews
d
definitely
a
great
beer
to
bring
to
a
byob
event
wonderful
taste
and
at
5
8
you
wont
be
legless
after
a
few
definitely
try
this
one
not
to
heavy
in
any
direction
i
got
this
one
in
a
winter
2007
magic
hat
mardi
gras
mix
pack
i
think
magic
hat
is
hugely
under
rated
anyone
leary
of
magic
hat
will
be
sold
on
this
one
full
of
hops
and
very
drinkable
i
could
swill
these
any
time
hope
i
spelled
leary
correct
the
rest
of
the
mix
pack
is
equally
good
or
just
score
a
sixer
smooth
and
slick
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
foggy
reddish
amber
oh
man
this
nose
talk
about
grass
just
a
huge
pile
of
freshly
cut
green
grass
in
its
prime
at
the
same
time
it
is
spicy
and
for
the
love
of
me
i
cant
pinpoint
what
precisely
it
is
as
i
was
pouring
it
i
got
a
whiff
and
just
had
to
focus
on
it
for
a
while
it
calms
down
fairly
soon
so
get
it
while
the
gettins
good
flavor
is
massively
earthy
and
robust
has
a
nice
leafy
tone
to
it
and
a
firm
hop
quality
to
it
as
well
stays
very
consistent
throughout
feel
has
some
good
carbonation
to
it
and
a
liquid
feel
that
is
very
good
as
well
overall
this
is
a
good
drink
definitely
worth
trying
especially
to
get
a
whiff
of
that
ohsounique
nose
suggested
i
enjoyed
this
beer
so
for
drinkability
i
would
definitley
say
yes
give
me
another
id
recommend
this
beer
but
it
hardly
knocked
my
socks
off
i
bought
this
beer
at
brewbrew
in
north
ridgeville
oh
the
good
people
of
magic
hat
recommended
i
drink
it
before
may
2008
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
great
either
starts
pretty
strong
with
hoppy
smells
and
taste
upfront
but
fades
rapidly
with
little
ot
back
it
up
d
nice
appearance
some
good
lace
smells
good
but
the
taste
is
average
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
in
all
respects
an
average
brew
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
one
and
wouldnt
purchase
another
sixer
again
wasnt
crazy
about
magic
hats
circus
boy
offering
and
this
one
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
either
all
in
all
a
mediocore
brew
which
wasnt
entirely
poor
but
not
outstanding
either
the
appearance
was
a
dark
brown
copper
color
which
poured
with
no
head
even
after
swirling
the
last
twothirds
of
the
bottle
the
smell
was
somewhat
bland
basically
just
about
average
the
taste
was
peculiar
hard
to
describe
but
a
little
medicinal
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
okay
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
beer
tastes
sweet
and
has
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
an
interesting
brew
to
sample
but
wouldnt
spend
another
8
bucks
on
a
sixer
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
magic
hat
d
nice
beer
not
outstanding
i
will
be
having
a
few
more
of
these
this
afternoon
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
a
red
d
this
hop
devil
errrr
i
mean
roxy
rolles
is
pretty
decent
drinkable
yea
definitely
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
would
i
buy
a
whole
case
thats
another
story
flavor
you
ask
sweet
chewy
candied
malts
caramel
floral
fruity
yeasts
and
a
nice
hoppy
bite
to
round
out
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
fairly
decent
thinnishmedium
body
with
a
decent
carbonation
level
and
a
good
lingering
hop
note
as
it
goes
down
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
this
amber
as
it
is
with
many
of
magic
hats
brews
its
not
overly
complex
but
packs
enough
flavor
and
character
change
to
keep
the
senses
entertained
definately
easy
to
put
away
a
few
at
a
time
and
have
no
reservations
about
going
back
for
more
in
the
future
