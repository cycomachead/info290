o
a
very
intriguing
interesting
complex
sour
ale
i
am
not
entirely
certain
that
i
would
say
it
is
equal
to
some
of
the
better
belgian
sours
but
it
is
definitely
close
probably
the
most
unique
sour
ale
i
have
tried
in
some
time
very
refreshing
and
assertive
lambic
worth
trying
this
is
a
tasty
brettysour
beer
is
it
worth
the
1
per
ounce
price
tag
i
paid
on
an
almost
12oz
bottle
absolutely
not
in
my
opinion
had
it
a
bit
of
carbonation
it
wouldve
made
a
world
of
difference
i
feel
but
the
way
it
was
just
wasnt
worth
it
not
for
the
price
there
are
plenty
other
lambicssours
out
there
just
as
good
and
carbonated
or
better
the
beer
pours
a
bright
hazy
yellow
very
few
bubbles
almost
still
smell
is
earthy
and
musty
with
some
lactic
fruit
taste
is
a
bit
of
nectarine
and
pineapple
slightly
metallic
some
sulfur
the
smell
and
flavor
seems
muted
possible
because
of
the
lack
of
carb
mouthfeel
is
like
water
really
hurts
the
overall
experience
of
the
beer
a
decent
effort
at
a
sour
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
real
letdown
i
love
the
beer
but
im
not
in
love
with
it
why
because
it
promises
a
high
level
of
complexity
and
flavor
with
aroma
but
is
so
blissfully
timid
in
its
delivery
that
i
feel
stoodup
on
a
blind
date
not
real
sure
what
to
do
now
o
nice
light
flavors
and
aromas
of
tartnesssourness
without
being
too
intense
i
found
this
one
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
note
2009
vintage
overall
for
a
34
yearold
lambic
this
was
pretty
spoton
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
sour
character
but
it
was
quite
quaffable
for
a
sour
worth
a
try
but
nothing
you
probably
havent
already
had
pours
light
transparent
yellow
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
nose
is
very
nice
dusty
and
cobwebs
up
front
light
earthy
dirt
note
with
a
strong
vinous
note
of
white
grape
and
fruity
pineapple
taste
is
similar
light
earthy
notes
and
fairly
dusty
very
fruity
in
back
vinous
white
grapes
big
pineapple
and
peach
with
a
nice
light
sourness
body
is
very
light
smooth
and
soft
with
a
gentle
carbonation
and
moderately
dry
finish
o
gotta
say
this
was
impressive
for
an
italian
beer
id
actually
consider
having
this
again
from
a
33
cl
2008
vintage
bottle
brought
home
from
italy
one
of
the
most
subtle
sours
ive
had
pours
almost
like
a
soda
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
big
bubbles
it
has
is
a
slight
cloudiness
not
surprising
as
there
appears
to
be
a
bit
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
color
is
golden
and
there
is
no
lace
and
only
the
slightest
ring
of
foam
kept
alive
by
the
copious
bubbles
aroma
is
keeping
in
line
with
the
style
slightly
sharp
and
oakey
with
sour
cherries
notes
there
is
also
a
bit
of
maltiness
that
might
be
masked
in
stronger
sours
the
flavor
intensity
is
also
scaled
back
from
a
typical
sour
here
the
malt
plays
a
bigger
part
yes
there
is
the
woody
tart
characteristics
you
expect
with
a
well
established
but
not
overdone
bitter
finish
but
again
the
malt
comes
through
as
it
warms
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
fermenting
apple
like
taste
at
the
finish
light
bodied
and
packed
with
a
biting
mouthfeel
from
the
carbonation
this
beer
was
nice
very
approachable
sour
d
i
had
about
4
of
these
in
my
four
days
in
brussels
although
im
not
sure
how
many
id
like
to
have
at
one
sitting
an
excellent
and
interesting
beer
though
o
truly
a
thing
of
beauty
for
something
this
old
i
am
thrilled
and
thankful
to
have
drunk
this
masterful
homebrew
twice
poured
a
murky
maroon
almost
brown
with
a
thin
foamy
head
that
hung
out
for
a
bit
smelled
rahter
musty
and
fruity
at
the
same
time
apples
and
old
berries
tastes
pretty
great
tart
fruit
with
must
like
overripe
berries
with
must
and
age
tart
really
nice
lambic
but
this
is
no
don
quijote
the
mustiness
is
fairly
heavy
all
around
this
beer
it
is
very
good
for
a
beer
that
has
some
30
year
old
beer
blended
in
there
and
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
had
some
really
nice
fairly
bright
fruity
flavoring
as
well
pours
a
lightly
hazed
light
red
color
with
a
smallish
pink
and
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
cherry
pie
leather
funk
a
bit
of
lemon
and
raspberry
with
a
hint
of
acetic
the
flavor
is
tart
with
a
nice
fruity
edge
to
it
lemons
cherries
and
raspberries
meld
nicely
with
a
hint
of
vinegar
some
leather
oak
and
funk
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
very
nice
kriek
it
seems
to
have
held
up
very
nicely
cherry
pie
like
aroma
cherry
vanilla
caramel
slight
funk
apple
and
grape
lots
going
on
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
mirrored
by
the
aroma
sweet
cherry
and
fruit
notes
with
some
overarching
funk
to
it
not
as
funky
or
sour
as
i
would
have
expected
balanced
overall
am
i
impressed
by
this
yes
and
no
yes
in
terms
of
how
this
has
held
up
and
the
overall
experience
of
getting
to
drink
this
no
in
the
fact
that
if
this
was
a
new
beer
i
would
have
been
a
little
let
down
some
carbonation
would
have
been
nice
medium
mouthfeel
i
find
myself
saying
that
i
could
drink
this
all
day
o
the
little
bit
i
had
lives
up
to
the
hype
left
me
wanting
more
so
great
big

the
beer
i
looked
forward
to
the
most

epic

this
was
very
disappointing
it

d
cant
believe
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
held
up
fantastically
over
the
years
its
sour
but
not
cantillon
sour
and
the
cherries
still
shine
thanks
again
for
saving
some
blake
happy
to
finally
bite
the
bullet
and
try
this
though
its
not
quite
worldchanging
its
very
good
and
youd
probably
never
guess
it
was
nearly
30
years
old
o
i
mean
this
is
a
30year
old
lambic
poured
from
a
keg
into
a
glass
then
into
a
1
5
ounce
vial
and
then
into
another
glass
at
a
rather
hefty
price
tag
its
really
good
and
quite
complex
but
i
havent
though
this
much
about
other
beers
in
a
while
so
its
complexity
might
not
be
out
of
the
ordinary
i
like
it
id
drink
it
again
not
a
bad
looking
brownish
red
and
definitely
hazy
basically
no
head
except
for
a
tiny
ring
around
edge
that
is
now
gone
the
musty
aroma
is
there
but
the
cherry
still
comes
through
pretty
strong
with
some
barrel
flavor
is
slightly
sour
at
first
followed
by
the
cherry
and
then
i
get
the
vinous
flavors
coming
through
it
is
hanging
around
between
sips
and
very
enjoyable
the
feel
is
pretty
thin
but
i
think
its
fitting
overall
very
enjoyable
i
am
very
grateful
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
legend
finally
able
to
ride
this
dirty
horse
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrownish
color
into
the
cantillon
sherry
tasting
glass
little
to
no
head
on
the
pour
a
nice
cherry
musty
and
leathery
aroma
wafted
from
my
glass
that
i
greatly
enjoyed
the
taste
combined
some
sour
cherries
with
a
slight
lactic
souring
red
jammy
and
dark
fruit
also
present
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thin
very
smooth
and
i
was
surprised
at
how
the
carbonation
held
up
very
drinkable
and
i
was
glad
i
tried
this
gem
would
like
to
see
how
the
blended
bottle
versions
are
tasting
right
now
for
some
comparison
pours
a
slightly
clouded
reddish
color
with
little
head
the
nose
is
slightly
musty
with
sour
cherries
and
a
big
of
barrel
smell
is
really
nice
the
taste
shockingly
still
has
a
solid
presence
of
cherries
vinous
and
slightly
sourfunky
very
nice
flavor
age
has
treated
this
one
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
low
carb
drinks
very
easy
overall
this
is
a
very
good
one
to
have
tried
the
effort
at
this
point
might
be
a
little
much
to
justify
but
it
is
a
really
good
beer
not
overly
funky
at
all
but
it
certainly
shows
up
with
some
barnyard
horse
funk
outstanding
and
impressive
fruit
flavors
for
its
age
nice
light
carbonation
sits
very
nicely
on
the
tongue
overall
a
stellar
beer
worth
what
it
costs
well
maybe
not
but
well
worth
the
experience

thank
you
alex
for
sharing
youre
a
supergenerous
dude
o
what
can
i
say
this
beer
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
and
i
thought
it
was
absolutely
stellar
i
was
happy
to
enjoy
multiple
pours
of
this
each
day
at
cbc
and
think
the
character
fullness
and
depth
is
brilliant
id
be
curious
to
see
how
this
holds
up
in
the
bottle
superb
beer
that
is
worthy
of
the
hype
urbain
doesnt
disappoint
and
neither
does
this
beer
standing
ovation
overall
this
was
a
real
treat
dirty
horse
has
aged
very
gracefully
after
almost
thirty
years
but
you
can
tell
its
starting
to
get
old
consequently
while
drinking
this
was
a
wonderful
experience
is
was
probably
not
as
memorable
and
impressive
a
beer
as
it
would
have
been
years
ago
that
said
this
was
very
well
balanced
and
the
flavors
mellow
enough
to
drink
is
mass
quantities
the
cherry
flavors
while
muted
after
so
long
still
provide
a
nice
tart
flavor
to
go
with
the
funky
sourness
and
light
bitterness
it
was
great
to
finally
try
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
2005
batch
at
some
point
in
the
future
thanks
again
for
bringing
this
one
to
copenhagen
gents
overall
getting
to
try
this
beer
was
a
real
treat
very
smooth
and
i
loved
the
level
or
sourness
compared
to
the
other
flavors
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
but
who
knows
if
that
will
be
possible
overall
on
my
beer
bucket
list
but
a
bit
past
its
prime
pours
a
murky
tawny
brown
with
minimal
ruby
tinges
and
zero
head
flavor
and
aroma
are
mild
and
subtle
with
less
sour
or
acidity
than
expected
wet
earth
bready
malt
sherry
and
tart
cherry
dominate
slight
oxidization
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
something
this
age
medium
thick
soft
chewy
body
with
trace
carbonation
this
and
v005
were
our
most
anticipated
beers
of
the
tasting
this
bottle
of
dirty
horse
was
an
amazing
experience
but
was
a
little
past
its
prime
and
the
blend
is
probably
a
safer
bet
at
this
point
overall
a
beer
thats
obviously
past
its
prime
at
this
point
though
still
quite
fantastic
id
love
to
eventually
try
the
blended
version
which
others
have
said
has
a
bit
more
bite
and
complexity
either
way
fantastic
work
and
im
glad
urbain
started
this
experiment
nearly
30
years
ago
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
great
and
no
where
near
deserving
the
hype
very
easy
to
drink
and
great
mouthfeel
but
the
nose
and
taste
are
a
bit
old
musty
and
weak
i
think
the
beer
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
at
this
point
very
fun
and
happy
i
got
to
try
this
but
not
something
worth
the
hype
or
what
it
takes
to
land
beer
is
super
creamy
in
body
great
mouthfeel
wonderful
finish
great
great
beer
chuggable
no
hint
of
alcohol
perfect
on
the
mouthfeel
i
keep
going
on
and
on
about
the
mouthfeel
because
it
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
the
beer
itself
was
a
little
bland
flat
and
mildly
fruity
with
a
musky
oaky
finish
im
not
saying
it
was
bad
but
it
is
not
the
best
unblended
lambic
ive
ever
had
id
be
interested
in
trying
the
blended
version
im
glad
to
have
the
experience
but
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
it
could
have
been
what
a
joy
to
sip
this
seemingly
mythical
beer
bottle
001250

hand
signed
thanks
urbain
drank
with
my
dad
carl
jamie
and
chris
after
about
5
minutes
at
chipping
away
at
the
bombproof
wax
job
i
am
finally
able
to
see
a
cap
upon
prying
it
off
i
am
met
with
some
mild
gushing
after
a
proper
lambic
pour
by
chris
i
am
met
with
a
gorgeous
brownish
tinted
garnet
body
and
a
robust
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
like
nothing
ive
ever
experienced
a
huge
old
must
character
gives
way
to
sour
cherries
geuze
cellar
leather
and
the
most
profound
funk
profile
ive
ever
encountered
the
flavor
holds
tons
more
old
must
with
a
beautifully
balanced
cherry
acidity
that
gives
way
to
a
mouth
puckering
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
ultra
dry
and
ultra
crisp
my
mouth
felt
just
as
dry
even
10
minutes
after
finishing
my
last
sip
easily
the
best
example
of
sour
beer
ive
ever
encountered
i
dont
know
how
beer
could
get
any
better
yeah
got
a
sample
of
this
at
rbwg
2010
because
of
fata
and
i
couldnt
believe
it
what
a
great
guy
wow
nice
red
pour
with
a
small
pinkish
head
awesome
cherry
and
sour
going
on
in
this
stuff
just
enough
malt
in
there
to
balance
it
out
really
good
but
you
knew
that
a
lovely
wild
sour
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
could
drink
lots
of
this
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
drinking
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
share
a
taste
of
this
liquid
seeming
like
this
couldnt
have
been
made
by
the
hands
of
a
mere
mortal
but
then
again
struise
is
not
a
typical
brewery
believe
what
has
been
spoken
its
that
good
and
worth
a
cellar
in
obtaining
a
bottle
d
how
do
you
rate
the
drinkability
of
a
beer
of
which
only
1
keg
exists
and
cannot
be
reproduced
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
lots
of
hype
but
it
really
is
amazing
very
tasty
mellow
refreshing
and
unique
its
certainly
something
id
drink
all
the
time
if
that
was
an
option
cheers
i
have
been
hunting
this
white
whale
for
4
years
now
it
did
not
let
me
down
awesome
i
cannot
believe
this
nearly
30
years
old
so
fresh
and
vibrant
even
after
all
that
time
this
beer
offered
more
than
i
expected
being
so
old
its
showing
its
age
but
still
feels
like
it
has
many
more
miles
to
go
its
especially
unique
since
i
havent
had
many
krieks
that
i
thought
were
holding
up
after
10
years
draft
sample
at
délirium
hoppy
loft
pale
red
in
colour
with
moderate
carbonation
ethereal
nose
of
cherry
funk
wood
lemon
and
leather
in
the
mouth
more
cherry
slightly
cheesy
funk
lemon
rind
and
savoryearhty
kitchen
herbs
delicate
on
the
palate
but
not
short
on
flavor
or
acidity
especially
on
the
finish
a
unique
masterpiece
d
what
impressed
me
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
fruitiness
that
was
still
present
after
such
a
long
period
of
time
overall
just
a
very
nice
lambic
o
the
hype
is
real
with
this
one
one
of
the
best
fruit
lambics
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
having
not
over
the
top
and
bursting
with
flavor
and
nothing
outrageous
going
on
here
but
incredible
balance
incredible
feel
and
just
amazingly
mellow
and
subtle
all
the
way
around
oh
yeah
this
is
review
1000
a
nice
wale
every
bit
as
good
as
hype
would
suggest
thijs
o
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
i
could
literally
drink
bottles
of
this
one
i
know
its
a
hyped
beer
due
to
the
availability
but
its
great
in
reality
if
i
had
a
bigger
tasting
group
i
would
seek
this
one
out
during
my
trip
to
belgium
this
was
the
best
beer
i
had
damn
this
is
a
beer
it
seems
urbain
has
been
doing
it
right
for
longer
than
most
of
us
know
cheers
to
you
my
friend
it
was
pleasant
to
drink
but
nothing
close
to
the
level
of
the
other
great
brews
we
sampled
that
day
from
my
notes
had
this
highly
sought
after
beer
at
the
alvinne
festival
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
ruby
color
with
white
head
smell
fruit
all
over
the
place
sour
cherries
and
woody
smell
taste
ver
well
balanced
starts
with
some
sweetness
followed
by
a
well
balanced
sourness
fresh
cherries
are
all
over
the
place
again
the
woody
hints
observed
in
the
smell
are
also
clearly
present
in
the
taste
overal
perfect
the
mouthfeel
is
still
with
just
a
hint
of
absorbed
co2
that
comes
through
only
on
the
palate
looking
at
the
beer
you
would
expect
the
carbonation
level
of
tap
water
completely
integrated
well
rounded
and
perfectly
textured
this
is
by
far
the
most
delicate
and
subtle
beer
that
i
have
ever
enjoyed
insanely
nuanced
and
balanced
this
beer
is
a
true
testament
to
urbains
craftsmanship
truly
a
world
class
offering
and
i
hope
that
i
am
able
to
try
the
new
batch
to
be
able
to
compare
my
experiences
a
couple
of
observations
one
there
seems
to
be
significant
bottle
variation
here
at
least
one
review
from
a
different
100
mentions
high
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
neither
of
which
mirrored
my
experience
two
its
remarkable
that
this
beer
hasnt
turned
into
vinegar
acetobacter
isnt
a
forgiving
souring
agent
and
im
surprised
that
the
oxygen
thats
enabled
the
sherry
note
to
develop
hasnt
negatively
affected
this
brew
three
i
wish
i
get
to
try
the
blended
version
cos
i
can
only
imagine
that
will
be
brighter
and
have
a
more
pronounced
cherry
character
not
that
this
beer
needs
either
but
simply
because
itd
be
interesting
to
try
very
well
done
urbain
those
ostriches
of
yours
showed
remarkable
restraint
in
not
drinking
all
of
this
we
have
to
thank
urbain
one
more
time
for
this
one
cheers
d
this
beer
was
very
inviting
from
the
sound
it
made
when
it
opened
to
the
ending
of
the
last
sip
i
could
and
would
have
easily
drank
this
entire
bottle
by
myself
but
i
had
to
take
only
my
share
of
it
a
nice
drink
that
wasnt
harsh
on
the
stomach
or
on
the
palate
this
is
one
beer
to
seek
out
and
i
would
do
it
soon
before
it
is
gone
forever
dm
very
drinkable
and
smooth
medium
carbonation
aftertaste
is
very
refined
and
clean
thanks
urbain
for
this
awesome
beer
thanks
to
popkas
for
generously
sharing
this
bottle
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
just
assumed
id
never
have
the
chance
to
try
pours
hazy
ruby
with
white
head
smells
of
cherries
lactic
funk
and
earthy
must
the
flavor
is
amazing
and
definitely
the
highlight
beer
of
the
night
in
our
massive
tasting
of
great
sours
again
lots
of
cherries
in
here
with
drying
oak
and
lactic
funk
sour
but
restrained
and
quite
mellow
the
fruit
is
still
remarkably
bright
amazingly
well
balanced
this
beer
has
held
up
great
for
being
mostly
27
years
old
and
seems
like
it
will
continue
to
hold
up
for
some
time
to
come
overall
this
was
incredibly
drinkable
much
better
than
i
expected
and
something
i
would
happily
drink
daily
if
i
had
the
chance
a
beer
worthy
of
its
accolades
it
was
a
bitter
sweet
feeling
tasting
this
beer
it
was
so
delicious
and
such
a
complex
beer
that
i
was
awestruck
unfortunately
it
will
be
a
very
slim
possibility
that
i
ever
get
to
try
this
beer
again
but
i
was
grateful
to
nerd
and
the
tasting
group
for
participating
in
such
a
great
experience
the
taste
however
is
amazing
far
exceeding
the
aroma
cherry
pie
restrained
sourness
a
hint
of
vinaigrette
the
balance
between
cherries
acidity
and
oak
is
brilliant
wonderfully
mellow
yet
flavorful
the
body
is
silky
almost
buttery
and
it
finishes
with
a
blend
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
and
drying
oak
taken
as
a
flanders
style
red
this
is
great
better
than
most
anything
else
ive
had
in
the
style
taken
as
a
lambic
its
on
par
with
some
of
the
greats
d
this
is
the
best
part
of
this
ale
its
highly
drinkable
seems
like
something
that
could
be
drank
all
night
without
becoming
overpowering
in
any
regards
all
and
all
a
good
beer
maybe
not
as
good
at
the
hype
but
still
pretty
happy
to
have
gotten
the
opportunity
overall
this
is
very
good
in
between
a
fruit
lambic
and
a
strong
canitllon
super
easy
to
drink
and
appeals
to
many
people
as
it
is
sweet
and
funky
it
is
worth
a
lofty
rating
probably
not
worth
giving
an
arm
and
a
leg
because
of
the
rarity
unless
your
just
crazy
like
me
and
zero
d
no
taste
of
alcohol
no
overpowering
sweetness
or
tartness
it
has
a
nice
mellow
taste
and
could
really
just
drink
this
all
day
this
beer
is
now
at
the
27
year
mark
and
it
popped
and
sparkled
with
the
complexity
of
flavor
of
a
beer
only
days
old
this
might
have
been
better
appreciated
had
it
not
been
consumed
next
to
some
significantly
heavier
stronger
and
more
palatebusting
beers
that
being
said
i
think
this
bottle
was
the
quickest
to
empty
amongst
the
stellar
lineup
we
had
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
by
myself
sorry
i
didnt
write
more
but
i
am
enjoying
it
way
too
much
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
sure
its
tart
and
sour
but
it
goes
down
so
well
plus
i
dont
think
anyone
would
be
able
to
try
a
glass
of
this
brew
if
they
didnt
love
sour
beers
i
only
got
a
small
pour
but
every
drop
is
worth
savoring
perhaps
you
know
how
great
the
food
is
at
ebenezers
i
let
my
lunch
get
cold
so
i
could
fully
enjoy
this
beer
i
am
so
glad
i
was
able
to
have
this
beer
d
good
a
nice
little
sour
beer
one
i
am
honored
to
try
as
i
never
thought
i
would
get
a
shot
at
it
cheers
to
urbain
for
being
so
generous
d
could
easily
drink
this
over
and
over
had
it
not
been
for
the
ridiculously
good
selection
of
other
beers
at
the
fest
i
might
have
just
had
this
all
night
d
what
can
i
say
urbain
said
it
best
life
sucks
but
not
here
d
just
great
after
returning
to
this
style
after
10
odd
years
this
is
surely
the
best
for
me
until
now
just
too
bad
that
it
was
just
on
tap
at
the
festival
would
have
loved
to
buy
some
of
these
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
normally
really
not
like
this
style
actually
i
almost
avoid
it
but
after
the
crianza
helena
and
blabaer
from
cantillon
this
is
the
3rd
i
love
pity
all
of
them
are
limited
brews
wow
this
is
one
hell
of
a
sourlambic
shared
a
decanter
of
this
5
year
old
horse
with
urbain
peter
phil
and
joe
at
the
struise
farm
pours
into
the
glass
as
an
orangehazy
color
with
hardly
any
head
this
is
where
fun
begins
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
vinous
with
a
hint
of
cherry
along
with
a
light
hint
of
wood
flavor
is
a
light
cherry
goodness
while
remaining
lightly
vinous
lightly
acidic
along
with
a
light
hint
of
wood
an
exceptionally
complex
brew
the
balance
of
this
stunning
sour
and
intermixing
of
sweet
and
sour
flavors
with
an
underlying
hint
of
cherry
is
just
superb
perfectly
smooth
light
body
and
juicy
funk
to
balance
the
sourness
absolutely
a
world
class
beer
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
words
cant
do
this
brew
justice
thanks
urbain
for
this
rare
treat
samnpled
at
the
struise
farm
from
urbain
from
a
wine
decanter
what
a
wonderful
5
year
old
treat
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
nearly
no
head
the
aroma
of
the
beer
had
nice
notes
of
fruit
cherry
and
some
wine
like
qualities
slightly
sour
the
taste
was
the
real
treat
although
5
years
old
the
taste
was
very
present
a
nice
cherry
quality
not
to
acidic
but
had
a
good
sour
quality
there
were
some
definite
wood
notes
as
well
i
found
there
to
be
an
excellent
balance
of
the
sweet
fruit
and
the
tart
character
as
well
this
is
one
very
drinkable
and
well
rounded
beer
i
just
wish
there
was
more
to
go
around
i
wanted
to
run
with
the
decanter
and
drink
it
all
but
that
would
not
be
good
form
for
a
guest
at
the
farm
seek
this
beer
out
if
you
can
find
any
poured
a
medium
and
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
very
small
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
mustiness
funky
wet
hay
earthy
and
lightly
fruity
tastes
of
mustiness
brett
light
citrus
and
lightly
bready
light
to
medium
sour
and
tart
finish
NA
originally
i
came
to
bootleggers
to
bring
home
their
pumpkin
ale
but
with
this
and
two
other
sour
beers
ontap
i
forgot
the
main
purpose
of
my
visit
and
took
home
the
fresh
lambic
id
say
that
this
turned
out
for
the
better
tempting
refreshing
surprising
highly
recommended
beer
has
this
chai
like
quality
to
it
with
this
clove
aftertaste
it
is
a
heavily
spiced
beer
its
sweet
on
the
onset
there
is
some
tea
bitterness
in
there
but
i
cant
identify
the
kind
of
tea
it
is
the
overall
spice
level
is
quite
high
and
really
does
taste
like
chai
there
is
a
definite
citrus
quality
to
the
whole
thing
lemons
or
more
likely
limes
maybe
some
peel
or
some
i
dont
know
juice
its
an
odd
beer
but
it
is
decent
i
dont
think
ill
seek
it
out
again
d
im
impressed
with
this
beer
and
thouroughly
recommend
it
notes
really
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
not
really
all
that
beer
like
although
it
does
somewhat
remind
me
of
a
flanders
redoud
bruin
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
and
i
luckily
was
when
i
had
mine
this
does
make
it
harder
to
rate
as
since
at
the
moment
its
hitting
the
spot
and
what
im
looking
for
im
tempted
to
rate
it
higher
however
i
think
the
majority
of
the
time
i
would
be
less
inclined
to
drink
this
this
rating
is
kind
of
splitting
the
difference
between
the
two
moods
tea
beer
is
a
strange
unique
and
very
interesting
drink
the
beer
is
a
clear
ambergold
color
with
a
very
short
head
the
aroma
is
not
unlike
iced
tea
a
theme
that
continues
throughout
the
experience
smells
of
citrus
faint
herbal
hops
honey
dried
flowers
and
of
course
tea
bags
the
taste
has
a
decided
lemonlime
flavor
the
label
says
that
the
beer
is
made
with
lime
juice
sure
theres
some
malt
t
here
but
the
primary
taste
is
of
sweet
iced
tea
with
a
slice
of
citrus
in
it
fairly
low
in
carbonation
smooth
and
a
little
light
it
didnt
really
satisfy
for
mouthfeel
interesting
and
worth
a
try
but
not
really
my
thing
this
beer
has
to
be
your
sort
of
thing
to
be
able
to
appreciate
it
most
its
not
really
mine
as
i
prefer
traditional
lambics
and
wild
ales
to
things
like
this

brussels
belgium
fine
thin

pale
amberorange
color
body
the
smell
shows
notes
of
wheat
with
a
round
and
pronounced
tart
character
right
in
the
style
some
barn
smell
too
the
taste
has
an
interesting
balance
the
tart
sweet
and
syrupy
aspect
of
the
brew
being
balanced
with
an
interesting
fruity
roundness
would
that
come
from
the
tea
leaves
on
which
the
beer
maturates
juicy
notes
of

for
the

orangey
for
the

and
peppermint
a
fresh

without

i
thought
this
was
gonna
be
stupid
and
gimmicky
but
ive
really
been
proven
wrong
aged
two
years
pour
is
a
slight
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
very
little
bit
of
thin
white
head
the
nose
has
a
cob
web
aroma
light
spicy
yeast
and
some
soft
peach
in
back
the
taste
is
very
dusty
cob
webb
up
front
light
spice
and
a
little
rubbery
there
is
some
lemon
zest
in
back
with
a
bit
of
sour
apricot
as
well
the
body
is
light
and
soft
light
carb
with
a
hint
of
driness
a
really
well
balanced
lambic
went
very
well
with
ripe
goat
cheese
at
a
food
and
beer
tasting
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
the
beer
feels
very
smooth
as
it
first
hits
my
palate
it
finishes
with
a
light
tartness
some
oak
astringency
and
a
biting
quality
that
is
quite
light
fruit
flavors
linger
with
notes
of
apple
and
some
pear
that
is
even
more
noticeable
this
has
a
nice
lactic
character
to
it
though
it
is
not
quite
as
apparent
as
the
mort
subite
oude
lambik
that
i
just
had
a
sip
of
cantillon
lambic
brings
out
some
musty
yeast
character
in
this
beer
this
really
has
a
nice
subtle
but
influencing
oak
character
that
seems
fairly
noticeable
sampled
from
the
barrel
poured
from
a
jug
tour
de
geuze
about
12
months
old
and
described
by
them
as
still
fermenting
by
them
and
young
appearance
is
also
supermurky
milky
with
some
bubbles
here
i
quite
like
their
older
stuff
and
lambic
i
have
had
from
them
before
but
this
is
a
bit
too
weird
for
me
to
get
into
i
have
never
had
a
lambic
like
this
nose
is
pure
rotting
grains
spoiled

lactic

watery
but
also
sort

full
because
of
grainy
and

wow
too
far
out
for
me
i
supposed
how
much
extracts
do
you
need
to
add
to
this
in

name
in
order
before
it
tastes
like
their
sweetened
artificial
stuff
this
stuff
is
so
weird
interesting
selection
and
one
i
was
quite
pleased
to
try
the
taste
is
very
good
with
tangy
white
grape
and
miold
woody
tannin
and
mangolike
tropical
flavor
with
slight
lemon
quality
in
the
background
with
slight
hint
of
sweetness
and
juicy
citrus
tangy
acidic
flavor
which
blends
with
slight
funk
and
herbal
flavor
which
is
best
described
as
woody
with
a
more
tropical
taste
almost
like
pineapple
with
a
dash
of
grapefruit
bitterness
in
the
tangyjuicydry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
lambic
for
my
first
experience
with
de
cam
not
great
carbonation
but
then
the
flavor
and
nose
make
up
for
that
i
would
drink
this
again
notes
from
2011
draft
modeste
2011
3
year
old
clear
orange
with
no
head
looks
a
bit
like
whiskey
sour
lemons
tart
barnyard
brett
old
wood
barnyard
brett
slightly
puckering
fruity
with
lemons
nice
o
very
very
nice
o
while
i
would
certainly
take
a
tilquin
over
this
any
day
its
quite
good
for
what
it
is
not
really
worth
the
price
asked
imo
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
all
the
same
has
a
low
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
fruity
beginning
in
which
mandarin
oak
and
lemon
peel
stand
out
accompanied
with
slightly
lactic
notes
acidity
get
more
intense
the
longer
it
stays
on
the
palate
leading
to
a
very
sour
overall
impression
still
it
is
very
enjoyable
due
to
barley
malt
and
dough
yeast
keeping
the
beer
in
balance
lemony
fruitiness
stays
on
the
palate
with
a
dry
sourness
leading
to
an
even
dryer
finish
easy
drinkable
and
complex
at
the
same
time
pours
an
opaque
light
orangeyellow
color
with
a
small
head
which
quickly
fades
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
lemon
citrius
and
apricot
with
grass
and
earthy
tones
aroma
gains
complexity
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
sour
with
light
carbonation
not
much
alcohol
present
and
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
the
bitterness
lingers
on
finish
very
smooth
and
light
overall
with
a
nice
sour
kick
thats
not
overpowering
purchased
for
40
a
bit
steep
but
enjoyable
nevertheless
one
of
my
favorite
beers
at
the
moment
not
bad
pretty
interesting
with
a
big
classic
funky
character
a
decent
lambic
rougher
than
the
usual
blended
to
my
taste
not
worth
the
price
light
and
fruity
not
as
funk
as
i
had
hoped
especially
for
the
hazy
golden
orange
no
carb
salty
oily
lightly
bitter
not
really
my
thing
outstanding
beer
but
very
expensive
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
at
35
picked
this
up
from
the
de
cam
brewery
bottled
jan
2009
mostly
clear
orangeyellow
pour
with
an
immediately
fading
head
and
almost
no
lacing
the
nose
is
amazing
with
a
huge
musty
funk
and
sharp
tartness
along
with
hints
of
oak
sour
lemon
and
barnyard
the
taste
follows
suit
with
sharp
almost
cheesy
notes
initially
along
with
hints
of
barnyard
tart
lemon
earthy
funk
and
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
smoothly
sour
with
very
little
carbonation
and
a
tart
puckering
oaky
finish
overall
an
amazingly
flavorful
and
hugely
drinkable
lambic
highly
recommended
a
beer
that
on
one
hand
begs
to
be
sipped
and
savored
for
days
and
on
the
other
that
is
so
refreshing
and
complex
and
simply
drinkable
that
you
wish
you
could
drink
it
by
the
carafe
price
35
for
750ml
poured
a
pale
golden
orange
body
with
minimal
head
and
lace
the
aroma
is
typical
tartsour
with
a
touch
of
acidity
as
well
as
woodoak
brew
is
more
of
the
same
as
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
as
it
comprised
mostly
of
a
sharp
acidic
sour
tartness
but
it
comes
across
less
sour
applecherry
and
more
sourtart
tropical
fruit
in
other
words
for
as
sour
as
this
beer
is
there
is
a
bit
of
both
oaky
woodiness
and
sweet
fruit
notes
to
this
beer
and
its
not
just
sour
but
also
a
touch
of
funkiness
these
are
the
sours
i
like
bc
its
more
complex
than
drinking
some
highly
carbonated
sour
juice
that
some
beers
of
this
style
are
like
overall
my
first
de
cam
beer
this
easily
exceeded
my
expectations
what
a
nice
lambic
it
reminds
me
of
a
gueuze
that
is
slight
heavier
than
most
gueuze
complex
balanced
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
a
must
try
for
every
sour
beer
fan
large
format
corn
and
caged
bottle
from
tipples
bottled
22012
drank
on
2232014
pours
perfectly
clear
golden
orange
with
no
head
at
all
nuthin
but
i
expected
that
aroma
of
sour
vinegar
sweet
sugars
a
tiny
hint
of
mint
smells
very
pleasant
flavor
is
sour
but
not
puckeringly
so
sweet
with
some
peachy
influence
a
bit
of
vinegar
fermented
apples
maybe
and
a
bit
of
spearmint
in
the
back
completely
flat
but
i
was
told
to
expect
this
honestly
i
think
the
flatness
takes
a
bit
away
from
the
brew
slightly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
somewhat
heavy
for
the
lambic
style
that
usually
comes
off
extra
dry
and
light
to
me
i
like
the
flavors
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
isnt
my
thing
more
like
drinking
a
dry
white
wine
than
a
beer
for
40
id
rather
have
a
couple
fou
fones
or
one
of
many
other
things
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
and
get
my
unblended
lambic
tick
overall
really
good
lambic
hugely
funky
with
lots
of
character
i
cant
help
but
feel
like
some
carbonation
would
have
made
it
better
even
though
i
understand
its
intended
to
be
still
overall
id
say
its
worth
the
high
price
tag
o
great
drinkability
very
delicate
lambic
excellent
stuff
one
of
the
best
straight
lambics
ive
had
though
it
is
the
oldest
ive
had
as
well
definitely
compares
to
drie
fonteinen
and
cantillon
medium
bodied
with
delicate
carbonation
and
a
nice
balance
of
lactic
funk
acetic
acid
oak
barrel
and
sweet
fruit
tart
and
puckering
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sourness
great
oak
barrel
and
lacticcheesy
funk
flavors
along
with
lingering
acetic
acid
thats
complimented
by
light
fruit
and
zesty
citrus
not
solventlike
harsh
or
overly
acidic
with
strawberry
and
orange
zest
sweetness
countering
the
sour
funk
mouthfeel
is
incredible
with
the
perfect
amount
of
acetic
qulaity
that
leaves
me
thirsting
for
more
incredibly
complex
yet
insanely
drinkable
excellent
overall
a
really
nice
lambic
up
there
with
the
best
overall
these
beers
always
make
me
crave
a
full
on
gueuze
its
a
teaser
overall
great
stuff
here
quality
is
up
with
the
best
making
3f
de
cam
and
cantillon
the
best
of
the
best
when
it
comes
to
gueuze
like
any
beer
geek
didnt
know
that
already
its
just
nice
to
try
this
one
and
confirm
it
for
myself
thanks
again
jeff
o
this
was
a
really
sneaky
hit
for
the
night
even
though
it
was
flat
it
was
still
deliciously
complex
i
wish
i
had
another
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
my
first
from
de
cam
this
is
a
really
wellmade
delicious
beer
that
has
aged
very
nicely
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
overall
this
was
a
nice
lambic
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
one
glass
was
enough
overall
a
solid
lambic
that
i
was
glad
to
try
lots
of
good
tart
fruity
elements
with
just
a
touch
of
acidity
to
give
it
the
kick
it
needs
pretty
impressed
with
de
cam
so
far
so
hopefully
this
trend
continues
recommended
o
this
smells
great
but
is
tasting
very
young
and
a
bit
too
watery
a
bright
golden
orange
near
amber
color
with
a
thin
yellowish
cap
made
up
of
various
sized
bubbles
the
nose
is
of
spoiled
fruits
and
musty
old
wood
some
notes
of
aged
cheese
saddle
leather
wet
hay
and
citrus
fruits
amazingly
mustyfunky
on
the
palate
fruity
notes
seem
to
emerge
up
front
before
a
rush
of
barn
old
wood
salt
cheese
and
sweaty
saddle
leather
a
good
sized
dose
of
lacto
and
vinegar
in
the
finish
good
and
sour
medium
body
dry
and
tart
in
the
finish
low
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
unblended
lambic
a
good
amount
of
wood
comes
through
in
the
finished
product
i
wasnt
quite
expecting
that
but
it
really
adds
this
wild
dimension
sour
and
funky
in
all
the
right
spots
mustard
brown
colored
with
a
rapidly
disappearing
fizzy
head
loads
of
funk
but
limited
acidity
in
the
aroma
very
welcoming
tartness
with
notes
of
hay
must
and
some
phenolic
bitterness
at
the
end
very
lactic
dry
and
sharp
mouthfeel
very
good
very
approachable
and
enjoyable
moderately
sour
beer
doesnt
have
quite
the
intenseness
of
a
3f
or
cantillon
but
still
pleasant
my
only
nitpick
is
the
vinegar
was
a
little
strong
at
times
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
yellow
with
a
slightly
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
dots
of
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
funky
with
some
woody
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
woody
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
a
world
class
beer
its
just
held
up
so
well
over
the
nearly
ten
years
its
been
in
a
bottle
really
complex
and
layered
yet
approachable
and
drinkable
certainly
worth
the
wait
bottled
january
2009
mmm
juicier
and
smoother
than
a
gueuze
but
with
all
the
same
notes
there
isnt
that
rough
bite
or
sour
jawclenching
tang
the
aroma
holds
the
funky
wild
barrel
character
and
the
flavor
is
almost
a
touch
juicy
theres
nothing
new
in
this
beer
its
just
a
very
well
built
lambic
that
smoothed
with
time
to
showcase
the
barnyard
and
farmhouse
notes
is
a
more
gentle
format
very
cool
beer
you
could
use
it
as
an
intro
to
lambics
or
just
enjoy
on
a
summer
afternoon
o
a
great
example
of
an
unblended
lambic
being
better
than
most
geuezes
simply
fantastic
overall
pretty
nice
lambic
we
had
a
2003
shortly
after
and
aged
had
improved
it
overall
overall
an
alright
beer

the

overall
this
is
by
far
the
best
example
of
an
unblended
lambic
i
have
ever
had
not
too
puckering
or
overly
tart
or
unpleasant
in
any
manor
just
really
complex
with
many
different
light
flavors
of
hay
wet
oak
must
but
all
balanced
quite
well
together
definitely
recommended
and
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
o
very
impressed
with
this
now
89
year
old
beer
i
can
see
why
these
things
age
with
grace
lots
of
flavors
and
an
intense
sourness
that
isnt
harshly
acidic
a
very
fine
yet
very
expensive
beer
o
have
to
say
it
was
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
ever
had
and
was
drinking
fabulous
definitely
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
of
more
of
this
brew
flavor
of
an
umblended
perfect
great
body
great
sticky
flavors
some
white
grape
ad
kind
tannin
bitters
and
oak
bittering
phenomenal
light
bodied
lightish
carbonation
nice
mouthfeel
so
damn
drinkable
this
is
a
crazy
good
and
at
the
same
time
scary
brew
well
worth
the
time
and
trouble
to
seek
out
o
great
flavors
low
acidity
very
dry
and
super
easy
to
drink
a
few
more
bubbles
and
this
would
have
been
perfect
thanks
again
for
sharing
chris
a
real
undertheradar
lambic
smells
great
and
is
really
funky
sour
and
developed
overall
lack
of
carbonation
is
a
plus
for
me
in
this
style
worth
the
money
feel
is
pretty
light
this
thing
while
being
unblended
still
has
a
lively
crisp
feel
to
it
the
sour
just
whisks
around
the
mouth
causing
sweet
damage
a
whole
bottle
of
this
you
betcha
if
i
found
a
bottle
if
this
now
after
the
street
date
i
would
not
hesitate
cheers
o
at
5
this
drinks
way
too
fast
it
might
be
the
most
expensive
beer
ive
drank
in
terms
of
how
long
it
lasted
i
cant
get
enough
of
that
funky
yeasty
tartness
and
general
belgian
lambic
aroma
so
good

4
5
right
before
the
tap
table
closed
they
were
doing
a
beer
of
the
week
special
the
description
they
had
on
this
beer
sounded
like
it
would
be
pretty
amazing
so
i
bit
the
bullet
and
bought
a
bottle
to
bring
home
with
me
the
following
day
i
had
gone
to
a
friends
place
and
we
split
the
bottle
together
popped
the
cork
out
and
gave
it
a
pour
the
hazy
orange
yellow
liquid
didnt
produce
much
head
or
lacing
the
smell
was
filling
our
noses
before
we
even
had
put
the
glasses
to
our
faces
the
funky
smell
was
very
prominent
the
deeper
you
breathe
this
one
in
the
more
aromas
that
come
out
it
had
a
really
interesting
sour
grapefruit
aroma
in
there
mixed
with
earth
and
wood
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
acidic
at
first
tart
citrus
flavors
like
grapefruits
and
some
apple
in
there
too
the
taste
then
fades
into
a
much
smoother
earth
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
medium
bodied
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
good
for
its
style
i
cant
see
myself
ever
buying
it
again
because
of
the
cost
i
dont
enjoy
this
style
enough
to
drop
almost
30
on
one
bottle
however
if
you
like
the
style
and
you
have
the
money
do
yourself
the
favor
and
try
this
its
impressive
shared
this
one
with
my
doppelganger
by
the
pool
as
a
part
of
my
birthday
weekend
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweeet
malt
cherry
funk
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
cherry
aspect
on
this
one
was
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
with
the
funkiness
going
on
in
it
this
one
was
quite
easy
drinking
with
the
earthy
aspect
glad
i
got
to
share
this
one
with
a
few
others
as
well
as
this
was
a
nice
brew
allaround
overall
loved
it
overall
a
great
musty
raw
lambic
with
citrus
and
funky
undertones
i
really
liked
it
a
great
unblended
oude
lambic
but
not
affordable
or
abundant
enough
to
drink
frequently
this
is
the
2000
batch
bottled
in
2003
that
came
to
the
us
earlier
this
year
amber
orange
color
with
actual
carbonation
it
isnt
still
aroma
is
funky
lambic
and
a
bit
of
must
flavor
is
sour
lambic
but
nothing
mindblowing
ive
had
bottles
of
cantillon
bruocsella
that
were
better
and
some
that
were
worse
this
was
definitely
not
worth
the
32
i
spent
and
the
de
cam
gueuze
is
better
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
recommended
to
anyone
enjoying
lambics
or
sours
overall
beautiful
lambic
that
aged
gracefully
o
nice
to
have
a
oude
lambiek
available
in
bottle
form
this
is
right
up
my
alley
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
this
this
one
is
pretty
still
on
the
feel
as
would
be
expected
from
an
unblended
overall
this
one
is
though
to
beat
really
unique
and
one
id
love
to
have
more
of
this
is
a
very
quite
funk
train
rather
mild
horse
blanket
mildly
acidic
on
the
finish
sour
yes
lip
puckering
no
a
distinct
ashy
and
leathery
quality
is
dicernable
reminds
me
of
a
fine
washed
rind
cheese
this
is
a
fantastic
well
balanced
effort
i
am
very
happy
to
have
shared
this
with
good
friends
light
and
enjoyable
with
some
absolutely
unreal
complexity
phenomenal
on
all
levels
from
the
flavors
to
the
feel
to
the
aroma
nothing
in
this
beer
underperforms
the
world
class
lambic
that
it
is
i
need
to
pick
up
some
of
the
03
to
see
how
they
compare
the
palate
opens
intensely
sour
with
grapefruit
peel
lemon
peel
very
briny
and
salty
intensely
funky
this
is
quite
acidic
but
still
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
salty
sulfury
and
mineraly
the
stinky
cheese
character
is
complex
tannic
and
drying
on
the
finish
theres
also
a
little
juicy
lemony
character
keeping
things
fresh
mediumlight
in
body
with
light
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
sublime
probably
the
best
unblended
lambic
ive
had
notes
disappointed
by
this
at
first
i
thought
the
overt
musty
character
indicated
a
flaw
but
its
consistent
with
most
reviewers
notes
not
a
fan
of
the
big
must
though
opinion
i
must
say
that
the
low
carbonation
in
this
beer
really
hurt
it
and
i
guess
i
never
really
realized
how
dependent
this
style
is
on
having
high
carbonation
all
of
the
lambic
elements
are
there
so
i
would
personally
just
write
this
one
off
to
a
failing
cork
and
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
in
hopes
of
getting
one
that
was
a
little
more
lively
i
have
never
had
a
review
that
was
this
mixed
but
i
really
think
that
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
that
this
particular
bottle
just
lost
some
fizz
i
would
try
it
if
you
have
the
chance
and
you
like
this
style
the
bottle
you
get
may
be
more
carbonated
d
not
as
sharp
and
sour
as
i
had
hoped
but
tasty
and
very
drinkable
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
a
fantastic
brew
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
tart
and
oaky
white
grape
fruitiness
and
somewhat
dry
in
the
taste
dry
and
tart
white
grape
and
a
nice
oaky
flavor
quite
clean
and
full
a
smooth
and
sour
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
oak
and
hints
of
tart
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
whats
not
to
love
here
tart
and
oaky
clean
and
fantastic
d
a
very
nice
brew
with
good
complexity
and
drinkability
for
its
biting
sourness
thanks
to
scott
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
nice
beige
head
nose
has
a
great
sour
presence
but
is
well
balanced
some
earthy
funk
in
there
as
well
taste
also
has
a
nice
amount
of
tartness
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
soemwhat
full
body
great
stuff
will
have
to
pick
a
couple
up
for
the
cellar
beer
is
thin
and
mildly
carbonated
on
the
palate
the
lead
off
is
a
little
weak
but
thats
ok
because
its
quite
tart
on
the
backend
of
the
beer
puckering
would
be
a
good
way
to
describe
it
there
is
a
citric
style
sourness
to
it
followed
by
some
milder
lactic
smoothness
acetic
is
minimal
the
beer
overall
is
quite
good
im
glad
i
opened
it
very
enjoyable
this
beer
appears
very
hazy
and
orange
hued
with
virtually
no
head
whatsoever
it
looks
almost
completely
uncarbonated
the
aroma
is
great
with
notes
of
hay
earth
tart
citrus
straw
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
with
a
dry
finish
oude
lambiek
de
cam
has
enough
tartness
to
cause
your
cheeks
to
pucker
after
each
sip
this
brew
is
a
solid
example
of
an
unblended
lambic
and
a
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
again
d
a
fantastic
lambic
the
age
has
obviously
helped
and
its
lack
of
carbonation
really
puts
the
smooth
yet
mellow
funk
and
acidic
sour
fruits
in
full
view
i
could
easily
have
drunk
this
whole
bottle
if
i
felt
like
it
overall
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
world
class
treat
that
is
worth
the
price
tag
in
my
opinion
the
bottle
works
well
split
4
ways
d
i
could
drink
one
of
these
a
night
easy
d
im
not
sure
how
i
would
feel
if
i
dropped
the
30
on
this
one
glad
i
got
to
try
it
maybe
it
could
use
more
time
to
become
something
i
would
really
enjoy
right
now
i
would
probably
pass
on
another
glass
of
this
and
let
someone
that
really
loves
it
have
it
d
light
on
the
palette
with
a
low
abv
nothing
is
too
harsh
hereharmonizes
perfectly
d
i
am
extremely
glad
i
picked
this
up
i
will
have
no
trouble
finishing
off
this
bottle
on
my
own
cheers
drinkability
neither
too
acidic
nor
too
funky
a
good
balance
of
the
two
great
beer
drinkability
i
seemed
to
enjoy
this
one
much
more
than
everyone
and
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
certainly
an
interesting
example
of
the
style
that
is
more
authentic
than
most
definitely
a
beer
that
you
dont
want
to
drink
too
much
of
at
once
this
is
delicious
one
of
the
best
unblended
lambics
i
have
had
2013
batch
3
7
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
2009
a
bit
muted
and
on
the
bitter
side
feels
a
little
bland
as
well
barely
tart
and
not
really
sour
muted
grapefruit
pith
at
room
temperature
okay
but
would
save
my
money
next
time
very
good
doesnt
have
enough
complexity
to
put
it
in
girardin
territory
but
it
still
very
good
surprisingly
understated
and
approachable
mind
blown
will
go
on
record
as
stating
this
to
be
the
best
lambic
ive
had
to
date
simply
amazing
and
delicious
2003
vintage
brewed
in
2000
and
bottled
in
2003
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
and
actually
develops
a
little
ring
of
a

nose
is
musty
cobwebby
cellar
wet
oak
overripe
lemon
mineral
wet
rock
barn
and
lactic
sticks
out
more
than
acid
wonderful
taste
is
round
and
smooth
and
defined
not
bracingly
sour
everything
has
come
together
perfectly
in
the
taste
must
oak
citrus
and
barn
rule
but
are
rounded
out
and
balanced
by
a
citrusy
mouthwatering
middle
and
a
long
almost
peppery
finish
soft
and
silky
the
aging
process
has
managed
to
give
just
a
hint
of
tingle
to
the
medium
body
which
seems
fuller
and
more
presentlivingreal
than
other
lambics
that
ive
tried
i
could
drink
this
everyday
an
outstanding
beer
well
worth
tracking
down
taste
is
mouthpuckering
and
tart
its
got
that
wet
horse
blanket
taste
to
it
thats
really
cool
theres
a
nice
light
carbonation
to
i
that
i
like
a
lot
it
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
overall
very
good
overall
a
very
nice
lambic
that
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
try
might
be
a
little
harsh
in
my
review
since
i
cant
help
but
compare
it
to
jj
blauw
which
was
also
a
lambic
from
2003
definitely
recommended
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
overall
i
thought
this
beer
smelled
amazing
and
tasted
almost
as
good
a
very
wellcrafted
lambic
thats
well
worth
a
shot
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
and
although
its
above
average
doesnt
meet
my
wild
expectations
for
de
cam
or
a
10
year
old
lambic
the
flavor
adds
in
some
good
notes
of
citrus
and
rind
underneath
the
hay
funk
and
wet
leather
that
the
nose
had
pulled
together
the
finish
is
quite
excellent
with
a
slight
sourness
and
a
beautiful
dryness
carbonation
is
light
throughout
and
this
goes
down
quite
well
thanks
again
eric
d
i
really
like
this
one
although
i
think
it
may
be
past
its
prime
at
this
stage
looking
forward
to
comparing
it
to
a
fresh
vintage
very
easy
to
drink
in
any
case
d
meh
its
okay
not
mindblowing
the
metallic
harshness
thats
showing
up
for
me
is
offputting
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
d
a
nice
treat
aging
well
an
evening
out
of
the
nose
would
have
improved
this
one
a
bit
no
way
ive
had
a
better
lambic
to
date
ive
tried
some
other
classics
while
in
belgium
and
also
those
that
are
available
in
the
us
and
this
one
is
my
favorite
the
toes
a
happy
accident
2000
bottle
medium
orange
clear
pour
thin
white
ring
of
a
head
that
fades
into
nothing
funky
minerally
on
the
nose
some
vibrant
lemons
quite
a
refined
and
balanced
nose
pleasant
flavor
refined
yet
lively
focusing
on
lemon
citrus
acids
a
good
dose
of
barnyard
funk
and
minerals
soft
soft
flavor
very
nice
reminds
me
of
crianza
helena
in
its
refined
balanced
nuances
full
of
really
expressive
flavors
dthis
has
a
huge
drinkability
factor
to
it
everything
is
very
soft
and
subtle
with
a
nice
balance
to
it
this
is
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
and
the
texture
is
a
little
flat
at
times
but
this
is
a
straight
lambic
so
you
have
to
expect
that
i
really
like
the
ample
wood
character
here
though
the
aroma
is
definitely
a
touch
more
interesting
than
the
flavor
and
a
bit
more
balanced
too
the
texture
seems
to
compete
with
the
balance
in
the
flavor
overall
though
this
is
a
very
nice
and
tasty
lambic
and
i
would
love
to
have
a
bunch
of
these
in
the
cellar
its
very
interesting
to
finally
have
an
unblended
lambic
this
old
i
think
as
it
ages
it
gets
more
complex
but
it
takes
a
very
long
time
to
do
so
im
still
trying
to
explore
this
style
d
while
you
do
have
to
enjoy
the
oak
component
this
is
still
a
nice
lambic
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
woody
and
lactic
on
the
palate
firmly
sour
and
fruity
with
strong
but
soft
tannins
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
tannins
are
nicely
balanced
by
the
lemony
acidity
carbonation
is
at
a
low
almost
flat
level
it
finishes
oaky
and
drying
with
notes
of
mellow
lactic
acidity
cider
and
lemon
rind
excellent
drinkability
was
also
perfect
as
no
alchol
was
present
and
it
is
lower
abv
md
for
my
palate
the
texture
falls
slightly
too
flat
but
for
an
old
lambiek
i
guess
thats
the
rule
of
the
game
and
its
remedied
by
a
very
soothing
sourness
throughout
that
keeps
my
tongue
happy
this
is
a
mediumbodied
subtle
lambiek
worth
trying
at
least
once
in
ones
drinking
life
my
mind
now
plays
with
the
idea
to
drink
it
served
straight
from
the
barrel
im
sure
its
gonna
be
sublime
but
it
seems
no
further
ageing
is
needed
for
this
vintage
or
this
bottle
at
least
otherwise
the
delicate
balance
will
be
replaced
by
real
boredom
i
think
hazy
golden
gentle
white
ring
deep
slightly
citrusy
nose
lactic
and
well
ponctuated
with
yeasty
horseblanket
good
lemon
juice
acidity
all
in
all
well
blended
and
smooth
fairly
light
truly
appealing
and
diplomatic
close
to
a
9
for
the
nose
it
doesnt
quite
hold
up
in
flavor
where
it
is
juicy
horsey
and
astringent
there
is
this
herbal
bite
that
feels
almost
like
a
tame
jalapeno
which
would
be
paired
with
a
straight
hay
juice
shot
flavors
finish
very
quick
and
are
far
more
chaotic
than
in
the
nose
correct
mouthfeel
on
the
other
hand

bit
light

fully

the
bubbles
dont

very
long
1995
lambic
bottled
in
2000
and
drank
in
2004
poured
a
pale
hazy
yellow
beer
with
almost
no
carbonation
which
was
to
be
expected
nose
of
citrus
and
a
bit
of
acidity
taste
is
quite
dry
and
sour
with
a
surprising
but
welcome
subtle
sweet
ending
again
notes
of
citrus
lemonlime
are
present
im
not
expert
on
what
should
unblended
bottle
lambic
should
taste
like
but
i
can
say
that
this
was
a
real
good
experience
too
bad
i
probably
wont
be
able
to
get
my
hand
on
some
of
this
again
this
is
a
lambic
for
the
fourteen
and
younger
crowd
approachable
easygoing
i
could
see
this
as
a
middle
ages
table
beer
when
the
water
was
full
of
cholera
good
very
good
tartness
citrus
with
a
pleasant
funk
excellent
beer
overall
not
many
reviews
of
the
2010
vintage
here
and
perhaps
none
of
them
have
this
much
age
on
it
wow
was
i
impressed
with
how
this
bottle
has
matured
would
be
hard
to
pick
this
out
if
one
were
asked
to
identify
the
american
lambic
from
a
group
of
belgians
oa
solid
lambic
from
2011
all
that
is
left
is
the
acidic
notes
can
only
wonder
what
it
is
like
fresh
carbonation
is
noticeably
low
the
somewhat
intense
tartness
hits
me
up
front
in
the
face
wow
definitely
an
acidic
white
grape
winelike
experience
here
after
the
tartness
subsides
a
note
of
grain
does
peek
through
giving
this
more
of
a
beer
flavor
it
isnt
the
most
tart
beer
ive
had
but
its
certainly
high
on
the
scale
o
quite
complex
and
tasty
my
first
lambic
and
ill
definitely
be
exploring
the
style
more
ill
try
to
buy
another
bottle
of
this
to
try
with
some
age
o
this
is
my
first
unblended
lambic
i
enjoy
the
sourness
of
the
beer
but
i
would
like
more
with
no
experience
with
belgian
lambics
i
am
eager
to
try
more
i
like
this
one
really
just
a
decent
sour
nothing
too
special
but
all
the
flavors
and
qualities
of
a
good
lambic
are
there
in
varying
degrees
for
the
price
tag
of
1012
its
not
bad
but
more
than
that
and
you
might
as
well
use
time
and
effort
to
get
the
belgians
o
nice
tartness
oaky
citrus
with
a
pleasant
funk
good
beer
o
it
is
definitely
a
successful
lambic
from
the
states
always
like
to
see
more
breweries
around
here
try
their
hand
at
my
favorite
styles
overall
not
a
complex
flavor
but
its
decent
o
a
nicely
balanced
brew
quite
enjoyable
the
acid
and
funk
is
there
but
in
no
way
overwhelming

of
all
places
very
enjoyable
o
a
very
solid
american
sour
ive
gotta
emphasize
though
that
this
is
not
a
lambic
and
never
could
be
it
also
probably
shouldnt
invite
that
comparison
either
which
can
only
ever
be
unfavorable
for
itself
but
besides
the
linguistic
technicalities
this
is
a
really
nice
tasty
drinkable
sour
o
fizzes
out
towards
the
end
but
absolutely
fantastic
up
front
i
dont
know
why
but
i
always
associate
a
certain
taste
in
many
sours
with
horseradish
does
anyone
else
know
what
im
talking
about
1
5
d
if
im
dead
tomorrow
then
its
probably
because
i
finished
the
bottle
by
myself
wholly
undrinkable
even
for
the
most
seasoned
lambic
drinkers
im
not
a
sour
noob
so
im
not
overreacting
this
may
be
even
less
balanced
that
the
cantillon
kriek
i
had
a
while
back
brace
yourselves
acid
is
coming
i
got
this
in
a
trade
from
one
of
you
fine
people
last
year
but
i
have
forgotten
who
thanks
bud
the
first
whiff
of
the
opened
bottle
reeked
of
cider
vinegar
uh
oh
i
poured
a
couple
glasses
and
it
was
an
amber
orange
color
and
while
not
quite
translucent
it
wasnt
turgid
or
anything
the
aroma
settled
down
after
a
couple
minutes
and
it
was
less
vinegar
but
still
had
an
apple
cider
quality
flavor
was
more
cider
sour
apples
not
bad
at
all
if
you
are
judging
this
as
a
lambic
you
will
be
sorely
disappointed
but
i
do
respect
them
for
going
down
a
difficult
path
as
an
american
wild
ale
its
just
fine
there
are
just
some
qualities
to
authentic
lambic
that
americans
havent
nailed
yet
maybe
its
the
funk
maybe
its
the
yeast
maybe
its
a
je
nais
se
quoi
im
happy
to
say
that
the
ale
is
spoton
senne
valley
if
the
glass
blindly
arrives
at
my
table
and
if
told
it
was
an
authentic
belgian
lambic
then
i
would
have
agreed
with
few
years
under
their
belt
the
rivertown
brewers
have
figured
out
the
sour
puzzle
in
masterful
display
d
very
nice
lambic
great
overall
balance
and
complexity
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
malt
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
solid
aromas
and
flavors
drink
its
better
than
average
but
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
pretty
solid
most
brewers
steer
clear
of
naming
their
beer
a
lambic
due
to
the
senne
valley
indigenous
affiliation
and
expectations
that
come
with
it
rivertown
is
obviously
paying
homage
to
the
originals
with
their
own
twist
from
the
pop
of
the
cork
and
an
amazing
aroma
to
the
freshness
of
sourness
and
oak
of
the
wine
barrels
this
one
is
here
to
impress
top
notch
note
2011
vintage
o
an
easy
drinking
delicious
unblended
lambic
not
that
many
american
breweries
are
brewing
traditional
lambics
but
this
one
is
highly
recommended
o
overall
surprisingly
good
who
would
have
thought
a
decent
lambic
could
come
out
of
ohio
overall
this
a
great
beer
holds
true
to
the
style
highly
enjoyable
would
gladly
drink
again
overall
nice
much
better
than
i
expected
from
a
lambic
from
midwest
although
not
top
of
the
top
but
still
a
well
done
lambic
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
its
one
that
i
will
get
again
i
dont
have
access
to
any
other
domestic
lambics
and
this
is
one
that
i
could
see
myself
having
again
very
nice
and
well
done
solid
lambic
that
ill
be
happy
to
have
anytime
im
in
indy
and
can
snag
a
bottle
but
nothing
overly
special
id
prefer
more
of
a
sour
kick
my
first
unblended
lambic
and
i
enjoyed
it
im
still
not
very
familiar
with
the
range
of
sour
beers
but
can
say
it
was
tasty
even
though
it
seemed
just
as
much
of
a
dry
cider
or
white
wine
as
it
did
a
beer
d
wow
this
is
the
most
boring
lambic
ive
ever
had
the
aroma
was
soft
and
semiinviting
but
the
taste
was
megafail
this
is
upon
opening
has
some
of
that
classic
lambic
smell
which
is
always
a
good
thing
once
entering
the
glass
it
bubble
up
about
12
a
finger
of
head
before
quickly
disappearing
into
a
very
slim
rim
of
bubbles
the
nice
golden
hue
of
the
beer
is
vibrant
and
cloudy
at
the
same
time
the
aroma
from
the
opening
still
last
in
the
glass
and
is
very
enticing
which
leads
into
the
taste
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
stellar
as
the
smell
it
has
a
bit
of
watery
essence
at
the
end
of
the
sip
that
would
be
the
biggest
complaint
1
or
2
yrs
down
the
road
i
can
see
this
developing
more
in
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
was
spot
on
for
a
nice
american
sour
overall
im
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
and
ill
be
seeking
at
least
one
more
out
good
job
rivertown
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
the
other
sours
from
this
local
brewery
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
a
light
vinegar
note
but
still
a
decent
lactic
character
lots
of
lemon
peel
straw
and
a
decent
funkiness
though
mostly
just
must
a
touch
of
oak
and
green
apple
the
palate
is
a
little
dull
but
not
awful
good
tartness
with
oak
green
apple
lemon
and
a
touch
of
white
vinegar
not
terribly
complex
or
funky
but
still
nice
overall
this
has
gotta
be
an
under
the
radar
sour
its
made
in
ohio
of
all
places
and
thats
where
an
under
the
radar
sour
would
probably
come
from
get
yourself
a
bottle
if
you
like
a
sour
brew
good
local
surprise
here
would
have
again
would
recommend
to
sour
fans
thanks
maxspang
go
to
snobbybeer
com
overall
pretty
good
stuff
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
the
flavours
are
very
good
and
the
beer
isnt
that
far
off
from
some
of
the
more
renowned
lambics
i
have
tried
overall
impression
while
sour
beers
are
some
of
my
favorites
out
of
any
style
this
one
rocked
the
festival
into
conversation
all
day
about
it
if
you
get
a
chance
pick
up
more
than
one
bottle
and
ill
take
one
off
your
hands
in
a
trade
perfect
unblended
lambic
attributes
the
appearance
and
smell
were
above
average
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
has
high
marks
light
body
with
some
refreshing
carbonation
alcohol
is
a
nonfactor
not
overly
complex
but
some
nice
flavors
well
done
from
a
younger
american
brewery
and
in
my
home
state
in
terms
of
a
bang
for
your
buck
beer
this
is
a
strong
winner
mo
low
carbonation
maybe
that
was
the
result
of
the
early
gush
of
foam
or
the
odd
cork
issues
overall
id
classify
that
as
a
valiant
effort
but
theres
definitely
room
for
improvement
but
hell
i
think
its
cool
just
to
see
a
us
brewer
attempt
a
true
lambic
party
on
rivertown
lambic
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
lacking
in
the
wowfactor
department
not
a
bad
early
effort
hopefully
rivertown
keeps
it
up
thanks
to
jdiddy
for
breaking
this
beer
out
a
great
label
with
a
bottle
shape
that
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
single
malt
2010
vintage
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
pale
gold
hue
with
a
hazy
clarity
and
a
loose
quarter
inch
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
tight
white
band
around
the
edges
nose
is
somewhat
cantillonesque
salty
funky
citrusy
cork
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
funky
version
of
ithaca
brute
taste
follows
nose
no
surprises
however
the
funk
is
less
prominent
than
suggested
by
the
aromas
present
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
and
slightly
astringent
but
not
overly
so
carbonation
is
pleasant
not
overly
assertive
and
even
from
start
to
finish
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
love
to
track
down
a
couple
more
bottles
to
cellar
the
surprise
of
the
night
for
me
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
aasher
for
giving
me
this
one
during
our
massive
inperson
trade
when
he
came
down
to
visit
thanks
buddy
served

flute
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
lemon
zest
funk
and
slight
tart
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
lemon
rine
lemon
zest
citrus
and
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
was
really
surprised
at
how
citruslemon
forward
this
one
was
the
funk
aspect
was
quite
nice
on
this
one
and
played
well
with
citrus
however
my
only
gripe
was
that
this
one
wasnt
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
but
still
managed
to
come
across
as
a
nice
brew
to
all
who
tried
it
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
and
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
or
lemony
brew
fans

damn
i
need
more
oh
and
brewer
upgrade
the
cork
presentation
is
everything
and
id
hate
to
have
a
bottle
ruined
by
a
disintigrated
cork
overall
good
would
like
a
little
more
fruit
though
solid
stuff
the
beer
is
really
hazy
and
yellow
hued
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
really
nice
with
an
authentic
belgian
lambic
vibe
funky
citrus
yeast
hay
straw
the
flavor
is
quite
enjoyable
though
it
lacks
the
complexity
that
was
potential
in
the
aroma
the
finish
is
not
as
full
or
exciting
as
the
first
half
of
the
flavor
profile
a
decent
example
of
an
american
gueuze
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
before
it
was
totally
gone
not
a
bad
first
lambic
from
a
cinci
brewery
i
didnt
expect
anything
great
so
this
pretty
much
met
my
expectations
they
could
really
nail
this
with
the
next
batch
worth
checking
out
o
pretty
good
beer
probably
the
best
one
ive
had
from
rivertown
and
one
of
the
few
that
doesnt
have
any
glaring
deficiencies
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
a
good
amount
of
white
head
smells
tart
and
light
funky
but
not
that
earthy
tastes
tart
and
funky
the
sourness
is
not
that
strong
overall
tasty
but
nothing
special
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
that
rivertown
has
a
great
first
attempt
and
id
love
to
see
more
of
this
ogood
first
attempt
on
this
would
like
to
see
it
with
age
overall
surprisingly
good
a
good
stab
at
a
very
hard
to
replicate
style
i
am
very
happy
with
this
and
proud
that
its
from
cincinnati
this
gets
me
excited
about
what
rivertown
is
going
to
come
up
with
next
i
need
to
give
their
hop
baron
another
try
because
if
they
can
make
this
i
have
to
believe
their
hop
bomber
is
better
than
the
one
i
tried
brightly
tart
and
sweet
fruit
flavors
nectarine
citrus
tangy
lemon
mellow
vinous
feel
a
bit
cidery
though
not
getting
any
vinegar
or
acetone
at
all
more
of
a
clean
tart
lacto
some
slightly
bretty
funk
that
reminds
me
of
warm
white
wine
mildly
acidic
with
some
bite
to
it
could
be
a
little
drier
and
show
more
oak
character
overall
though
a
great
example
of
an
american
wild
ale
inspired
by
traditional
belgian
lambic
overall
a
great
sour
this
is
my
first
but
i
think
it
is
really
great
sour
but
not
so
that
you
will
clinch
up
like
a
mormon
feel
just
fits
the
taste
and
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
time
to
try
more
sours

i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
definitely
worth
a
try
m
a
good
beer
certainly
one
of
the
best
from
cincinnati
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
full
in
terms
of
both
mouthfeel
and
flavor
its
a
decent
tartness
but
it
should
be
sitting
on
top
of
a
more
complex
background
i
certainly
hope
they
continue
to
refine
this
despite
the
flaws
ive
mentioned
in
my
review
i
felt
this
beer
still
worked
which
is
why
my
scores
are
a
little
higher
than
youd
expect
from
the
review
itself
o
a
decent
brew
that
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
pick
up
the
13
99
price
tag
will
probably
keep
me
from
getting
it
again
anytime
soon
though
there
is
some
nice
lactic
sourness
with
an
acetic
brightness
mild
malate
and
some
citric
too
all
the
players
are
on
the
table
here
there
is
a
shift
here
to
the
brightness
and
away
from
the
lactic
creaminess
this
beer
would
take
some
sour
fruit
well
overall
a
great
attempt
and
im
looking
forward
to
other
sours
from
these
guys
pours
a
light
strawyellow
color
with
a
mild
white
head
the
nose
brings
some
light
cheese
and
funk
with
a
bit
of
acidity
the
taste
starts
like
a
berliner
with
some
mild
grain
and
wheat
plus
a
touch
of
acidity
some
mild
peach
and
apricot
character
there
light
body
and
mild
tartness
with
low
carbonation
the
nose
brings
some
bready
yeast
as
it
warms
mild
acid
in
the
finish
a
really
nice
attempt
and
a
solidlydrinkable
brew
especially
on
a
pretty
warm
evening
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
lambic
done
by
rivertown
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
it
seems
to
really
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
style
wise
its
very
well
done
o
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
offering
from
rivertown
this
is
a
really
good
stab
at
making
a
very
funky
beer
well
done
o
very
good
overall
i
am
proud
to
see
the
local
boys
turning
out
styles
like
this
i
think
if
it
were
to
age
a
year
or
two
it
would
really
be
somethin
this
is
a
very
nice
lambic
i
think
it
would
be
great
if
they
keep
some
in
oak
for
a
few
years
so
they
can
take
a
stab
at
gueuze
in
the
future
it
would
be
very
cool
to
see
this
type
of
development
in
the
usa
especially
in
oh
moderate
sourness
and
funky
qualities
with
medium
carbonation
black
cherry
and
other
red
fruit
flavors
on
the
mid
palate
with
tart
fruits
on
the
finish
nice
acidity
and
very
nice
overall
o
really
interesting
stuff
it
is
quite
different
from
both
older
lambics
and
from
the
regular
geuze
cheers
really
delicious

i
cant
believe
i
forgot
to
review
this
drank
this
while
chatting
away
with
armand
and
his
brother
in
the
restaurant
what
an
experience
the
beer
is
hazy
orange
to
copper
hued
and
appears
still
earthy
mushrooms
grass
farm
funk
light
and
smooth

a
day
a
memory
i
shall
cherish
forever
had
on
tap
at
the
pub
pour
is
a
dark
golden
amber
color
mostly
transparent
with
very
little
white
head
on
the
edges
the
nose
is
light
cob
web
funk
sweet
caramel
transitions
into
sweet
peach
orange
and
citrus
with
a
sour
note
accompanying
the
flavor
has
more
dusty
funk
creamy
lacto
aspects
very
strong
sweetness
in
back
tart
sour
lemon
citrusy
orange
peaches
and
light
bitterness
creamy
medium
body
with
a
soft
palate
and
fairly
assertive
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
great
balance
to
this
very
sweet
and
assertively
sour
less
funk
than
i
thought
going
in
but
will
add
a
nice
dimension
to
a
future
gueuze
this
is
quite
fantastic
all
around
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
the
nose
is
so
incredibly
complex
and
even
though
the
taste
is
not
nearly
so
it
is
so
refreshing
and
balanced
that
i
hardly
care
lots
of
diacetyl
could
have
just
been
an
off
batch
o
good
but
flat
and
somewhat
lifeless
light
body
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
and
a
light
bit
of
acidity
very
tasty
he
also
has
other
lambiks
brewed
by
frank
boon
and
girardin
to
his
recipe
theyre
quite
good
but
not
as
stellar
as
armands
lambik
od
a
good
lambic
the
aggressive
sourness
might
be
an
issue
for
more
than
one
or
two
but
it
was
still
quite
good
refreshing
and
tasty
on
a
lovely
summer
day
in
belgium
very
complex
o
i
have
never
had
a
lambic
with
this
much
age
and
it
was
nice
to
explore
what
time
in
a
bottle
does
to
drie
fonteinen
lambic
the
body
was
like
water
literally
in
this
case
it
was
not
something
ill
want
again
but
was
very
nice
to
gain
some
appreciation
for
the
progression
in
making
a
world
class
gueuze
i
couldnt
have
asked
for
a
better
beer
after
that
long
walk
in
the
rain
the
drei
fonteinens
young
lambik
poured
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
white
head
carbonation
was
almost
nonexistent
and
the
beer
had
a
generally
flat
appearance
aside
from
the
froth
vinous
aroma
that
isnt
shy
on
woodiness
tart
and
dry
with
white
wine
and
lactic
notes
balanced
and
easy
going
with
a
touch
of
citrus
flavor
in
the
finish
sampled
on
cask
at
the
brewerys
restaurant
dark
orange
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
lasts
smells
tart
and
sweet
complexities
showing
immediatly
beautiful
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
flavors
finishes
with
a
tartness
and
dry
enough
to
make
me
want
more
this
was
the
second
straight
lambic
that
i
had
ever
had
it
was
again
far
mellower
than
i
was
expecting
of
course
it
was
sanscarbonation
say
it
with
a
cajun
man
accent
its
much
more
fun
that
way
and
had
a
quite
noticeable
acidic
aroma
the
acidity
promised
in
the
nose
was
surprisingly
subdued
in
the
taste
it
was
much
more
of
a
balanced
mellow
acidity
which
i
am
surmising
was
the
result
of
a
bit
of
age
that
helps
to
smooth
out
lambics
the
beer
itself
was
quite
a
revelation
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
musty
character
and
an
appetizing
hint
of
mushroom
and
a
bit
of
character
nabbed
from
a
proper
strong
stinky
farmhouse
cheese
all
in
all
it
was
a
great
aperitif
for
the
impending
gastronomic
exercise
that
i
was
about
to
have
café
visit

brewed
lambic
since

and
their
coolship
is
on
the

roof
little
known
fact
overall
this
unblended
lambic
is
very
sour
and
refreshing
it
isnt
the
most
interesting
but
still
very
good
this
aged
lambic
is
crazy
tart
and
too
intense
to
be
very
drinkable
but
it
was
fantastic
when
mixed
with
the
jong
so
thats
why
they
make
gueuzes
d
really
cool
to
see
how
the
lambic
process
works
with
this
4
year
old
brew
i
had
this
with
the
new
lambic
side
by
side
and
it
was
fucking
cool
to
see
how
it
changed
mad
props
to
the
great
lambic
blenders
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
body
with
abundant
effervescent
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
one
finger
bubbly
head
overall
impression
of
appearance
is
of
a
nice
lambic
in
color
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
an
unblended
lambic
but
quite
on
point
for
a
geuze
scents
of
funky
barnyard
yeast
a
bit
of
a
smokey
and
enteric
quality
which
while
usually
demerits
for
a
lambic
are
not
unpleasant
here
though
these
aromas
fade
quickly
replaced
by
light
fruity
including
citrus
and
apple
hints
of
honey
light
hints
of
tea
and
mild
honey
aromas
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
sour
ale
that
is
quite
nice
sour
wild
barnyard
and

combine
nicely
to
form

overall
this
is
a
nice

perhaps
a

its

makes
up
for
that
and
the

and
an
interesting
version
of
a

so
yeah
my
first
lambic
sour
tangy
interesting
and
ill
need
to
try
another
lambic
sometime
but
not
sure
these
are
going
to
be
my
jam
in

and
very

to

a
very
enjoyable
offering
tasted
incredibly
grassy
im
not
a
big
kombucha
guy
so
its
hard
to
be
objective
about
this
one
which
i
have
been
looking
at
forever
and
afraid
to
try
surprised
by
its
clarity
looks
like
champagne
in
the
glass
clear
yellow
pale
with
a
bit
white
bubbly
head
very
clean
and
neat
fancy
looking
the
nose
is
brutal
though
like
straight
yellow
mustard
unappealing
as
it
gets
acid
and
vinegar
and
cheap
mustard
the
flavor
is
far
better
and
the
lambic
is
tasted
ahead
of
the
tea
which
i
appreciate
very
very
sour
and
way
more
carbonated
than
anything
else
i
have
had
from
these
guys
super
dry
and
sour
funky
but
just
too
weird
for
me
to
get
into
or
drink
much
of
sits
weird
in
the
belly
and
now
the
tea
really
gets
going
the
carbonation
is
through
the
roof
and
it
seems
to
exacerbate
the
sourness
of
the
beer
the
flavor
isnt
all
that
bad
but
i
cant
get
past
the
yellow
mustard
nose
it
turns
the
whole
thing
for
me
i
like
the
idea
and
see
it
gaining
in
popularity
with
crooked
stave
and
all
but
it
has
yet
to
really
catch
on
with
me
maybe
ill
come
around
maybe
not
after
craving
something
light
and
low
octane
the
sourtartfunky
taste
is
really
doing
it
for
me
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
today
o
an
very
interesting
beer
the
lambic
and
tea
flavors
actually
blend
very
well
i
wish
it
was
a
little
bit
less
sweet
overall
with
a
heavier
emphasis
on
funk
it
could
have
been
better
if
they
blended
the
kombucha
with
a
funkier
lambic
overall
really
kinda
gross
not
the
worst
ive
had
though
overall
i
loved
this
one
would
recommend
to
everyone
fantastic
this
is
an
incredibly
successful
and
delicious
experiment
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
golden
color
lambic
with
a
medium
size
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
tart
notes
with
light
funky
notes
taste
is
refreshing
with
easy
drinking
tart
notes
with
some
light
funky
notes
kombucha
tea
was
harder
to
detect
body
was
about
average
with
good
carbonation
nice
refreshing
drink
for
summer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
complexity
0
decent
offering
with
a
few
strange
tastes
but
worth
trying
for
sure
d
interesting
mix
of
flavors
but
the
balance
is
spot
on
very
crisp
and
refreshing
poured
brilliant
hazy
yellow
like
a
deep
lemon
with
a
nicely
formed
white
head
in
my
trappistes
rochefort
chalice
left
a
touch
of
lace
as
it
diminished
into
a
thin
froth
the
nose
is
quite
nice
with
a
huge
bouquet
i
felt
like
i
was
in
a
citrus
stand
on
a
fine
mid
morning
in
summer
near
a
farm
lots
of
tartness
of
lemon
orange
and
acid
that
is
meshed
with
the
tiniest
whiff
of
a
well
tended
field
behind
a
farm
the
quaff
is
refreshing
crisp
and
effervescent
i
can
easily
down
the
whole
glass
but
i
do
prefer
to
savor
it
it
pairs
very
well
with
shrimp
cocktail
overall
a
steal
for
12750ml
i
will
pick
up
more
next
time
i
see
it
lighter
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
bubbly
and
unfortunately
lingering
on
the
tongue
i
think
what
the
fuck
is
this
was
the
overall
consensus
on
this
beer
ive
tried
it
more
than
once
and
hopefully
this
was
the
last
time
c

im
going
to
have
to
consider
stocking
up
another
bottle
for
myself
down
the
line
lambrucha
was
an
enjoyable
lambic
after
all
pours
an
almost
hollow
yellow
with
a
fine
whtie
foam
smells
strait
up
brats
sauerkraut
sole
lemons
nice
traditional
kombucha
character
bits
of
pepper
i
like
the
nose
flavor
is
tart
with
black
tea
of
the
kombucha
and
a
nice
lemon
tartness
and
a
slight
hit
of
meat
and
a
good
run
of
herbal
and
depthy
character
medium
with
a
fun
fizzy
nice
wet
finish
i
like
this
beer
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
kombucha
tea
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
pretty
sour
flavor
and
a
mild
spice
finish
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
very
interesting
aroma
resembles
lemonade
with
a
touch
of
white
vinegar
aroma
and
sure
enough
a
distinctive
black
tea
emphasis
flavor
is
again
mostly
tart
puckery
lemon
with
a
black
tea
emphasis
and
a
certain
light
mustiness
that
develops
as
the
glass
warms
up
towards
room
temperature
i
like
this
its
simple
yet
refreshing
acidic
and
tart
without
being
too
overwhelming
to
the
gut
and
the
lemon
tea
blend
is
a
really
nice
combo
o
i
like
lambic
and
kombucha
so
i
was
very
exicted
to
try
this
it
is
a
very
interesting
hybrid
the
acidity
is
very
good
for
fans
of
the
2
id
say
get
a
bottle
drinkability
definitely
not
one
my
favorites
my
wife
liked
it
but
she
loves
kombucha
tea
decent
beer
not
worth
the
price
but
kombucha
is
expensive
to
begin
with
puckering
sour
yet
fun
thanks
for
sharing
americo
definitely
some
mushroom
and
rope
with
vinegar
strong
fruit
and
wild
yeast
aromas
cloudy
peach
colour
with
a
nice
small
head
for
tart
fans
only
and
even
then
a
few
ounces
is
all
i
could
tolerate
overall
this
is
a
pretty
unique
sour
beer
and
the
abv
makes
this
more
of
a
cider
than
anything
notes
light
to
moderate
in
body
with
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
its
tart
but
not
overly
so
like
some
younger
lambics
tend
to
be
very
refreshing
and
although
a
bit
pricey
its
a
perfect
sipper
for
on
a
hot
day
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sumac
tea
definitely
worth
trying
o
this
is
one
strange
beer
between
the
pickle
taste
and
the
tartness
its
not
too
bad
i
would
actually
buy
this
again
and
again
for
some
reason
strangly
good
very
interesting
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
that
soon
setted
to
nothing
and
no
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
amber
and
no
bubble
trails
aroma
is
tea
spice
malt
and
mild
flavors
similar
to
nose
and
the
lambic
really
comes
out
and
works
well
with
the
tea
body
and
carbonation
are
great
its
kind
of
a
teageuze
beer
and
nicely
done
excellent
summer
beer
it
cleans
off
the
palate
during
a
meal
and
provides
cultures
to
help
you
digest
perfect
for
eating
with
m
d
crisp
with
an
assertive
and
lightly
sparkling
carbonation
like
most
sour
styled
beers
it
has
a
very
refreshing
finish
with
a
nice
hint
of
dryness
yet
not
as
puckering
as
some
i
found
this
to
be
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
hope
to
see
other
breweries
experimenting
with
this
style
in
the
meantime
ill
be
happy
with
this
beer
is
medium
light
with
a
fairly
high
carbonation
level
that
settles
as
the
beer
ages
in
the
glass
the
result
is
a
somewhat
prickly
feel
that
transitions
to
a
smooth
light
beer
running
across
the
palate
no
puckering
or
tartness
on
the
tongue
or
other
parts
of
mouth
overall
this
is
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
and
it
makes
for
a
good
drink
being
a
fan
of
sours
the
tang
of
the
de
troch
base
beer
is
better
than
ever
in
lambrucha
for
a
beer
of
little
abv
3
5
it
packs
a
punch
in
the
flavor
dept
this
could
easily
be
set
down
in
a
cellar
for
years
with
no
ill
affect
purveyors
turned
blenders
vanberg
dewulf
picked
some
nice
barrels
of
sours
to
make
this
hopefully
there
will
be
more
experimentation
to
come
overall
very
unusual
and
glad
i
tried
it
but
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
again
a
bit
bland
for
my
palate
more
so
lambic
yeast
dominanated
than
kombucha
and
bone
dry
very
light
in
color
coming
in
light
yellow

nose
is
crisp
ashtray
sour
with
what
smells
like
tire
inter
tubes
when
still
mineral
bare
bones
palate
is
dry
and
hunger
inducing
wondrous
for
such
a
low
abv
and
of
rather
high
standard
a
sour
most
overall
interesting
but
kind
of
on
the
fence
the
flavor
is
mildly
onedimensional
but
still
manages
to
be
good
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
i
am
a
regular
drinker
of
kombucha
something
that
you
can
definitely
tell
is
an
ingredient
in
this
beer
very
light
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
beer
in
about
five
months
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
it
was
an
interesting
experience
i
recommend
trying
lambrucha
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
tasted
and
very
satisfying
to
drink
the
whole
22
ounce
bottle
didnt
even
give
me
a
buzz
so
this
one
is
eminently
sessionable
and
refreshing
enough
to
quench
the
thirst
i
built
up
walking
from
penn
station
over
to
east
36th
well
worth
the
walk
weird
interesting
tasty
cloudy
cider
gold
finger
of
white
head
nice
tart
nose
lemons
and
mild
musty
funk
flavors
are
like
lemon
lime
soda
with
some
sweet
tarts
crushed
in
it
hint
of
the
tea
in
the
finish
light
bubbly
body
super
easy
drinker
maybe
not
a
true
sour
heads
delight
however
i
could
see
crushing
an
entire
750
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
the
smell
is
probably
the
most
intriguing
part
of
the
beer
the
herbal
notes
are
welldone
and
subtle
overall
its
unique
delicate
and
hard
to
place
still
its
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
for
the
price
i
paid
i
wish
i
was
drinking
a
regular
funkier
gueuze
instead
still
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
experiment
i
have
blended
beer
and
kombucha
in
my
brewing
mostly
not
very
successfully
so
i
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
i
would
be
happy
to
brew
something
like
this
for
refreshment
with
less
herbal
notes
and
i
would
go
through
a
keg
easily
over
a
few
weeks
however
at
14tax
a
bottle
i
dont
think
i
can
justify
the
cost
very
often
also
ive
not
seen
this
beer
very
often
o
what
a
refreshing
beer
great
concept
great
delivery
great
price
whats
not
to
like
o
very
interesting
beer
and
at
3
5
very
sessionable
the
drinkability
is
exceptionally
easy
could
drink
this
all
day
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
3
5
helps
but
the
tame
tartness
is
quenching
o
im
not
really
certain
how
to
rate
this
beer
its
unlike
anything
ive
had
before
that
being
said
it
is
an
intriguing
and
mostly
enjoyable
brew
that
is
obviously
crafted
with
care
id
have
no
problem
buying
this
again
shared
with
a
few
friends
on
a
friday
night
pours
a
fairly
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
smells
of
tart
and
funk
no
really
lemons
and
yellow
mustard
mixed
with
truffles
and
barnyard
this
is
quite
an
odd
aroma
but
it
kind
of
works
taste
is
tart
funk
with
a
nice
puckering
of
lemons
dominating
the
flavor
earthy
barnyard
mixed
with
fungi
round
out
the
flavor
medium
body
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
puckering
tart
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
trying
this
but
i
couldnt
see
me
drinking
more
than
the
6
or
so
ounces
i
had
in
one
sitting
conclusion
i
dont
even
know
how
to
rate
this
beer
it
feels
a
bit
like
it
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
and
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
too
lambic
is
such
a
crazily
broad
style
that
i
cant
say
that
this
beer
fits
or
doesnt
fit
i
like
beer
like
this
that
just
is
i
dont
personally
love
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
i
enjoy
it
enough
to
drink
the
rest
of
the
bottle
with
pleasure
if
only
it
were
less
carbonated
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
sharp
overall
this
one
isnt
bad
id
preffer
it
to
be
a
bit
less
sweet
d
quite
enjoyable
i
really
like
this
combo
together
a
very
odd
but
not
unappealing
beer
more
dryness
is
needed
to
bring
the
beer
closer
to
balance
to
increase
drinkability
and
to
keep
the
beer
from
tasting
like
fruit
flavored
candies
ov
really
surprised
this
came
from
de
troch
lambic
i
think
the
kambucha
culture
really
kicked
this
one
up
hope
to
find
it
again
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
minimal
carbonation
only
a
fine
scrubbing
prickle
in
the
finish
this
one
is
lacking
something
maybe
its
past
its
prime
i
would
try
it
again
dpretty
drinkable
but
its
a
little
onenote
in
the
taste
department
with
lemon
being
that
onenote
i
was
also
hoping
for
some
more
aciditysourness
than
is
present
in
this
one
a
nice
tart
beer
and
quite
refreshing
the
flavor
is
a
tad
lacking
and
is
one
dimensional
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
damn
good
and
very
unique
beer
im
impressed
and
this
def
exceeded
my
expectations
ill
be
buying
more
and
hope
its
more
than
a
oneoff
good
stuff
o
this
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
for
me
i
went
into
this
without
a
lot
of
expectations
and
actually
thought
it
might
be
a
bit
gimicky
and
maybe
it
still
is
not
sure
exactly
what
the
tea
added
to
this
however
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
makes
for
a
good
summer
refresher
low
alcohol
and
going
down
like
lemonade
definitely
worth
a
shot
price
point
will
likely
keep
me
from
getting
this
too
often
but
i
see
myself
buying
this
again
in
the
near
future
cheers
i
didnt
think
this
combination
would
work
as
well
as
it
does
the
elements
of
both
beverages
are
largely
preserved
and
retain
their
own
qualities
while
the
combination
is
quite
distinctive
and
ingenious
i
generally
hate
when
brewers
really
mess
with
tradition
but
its
hard
to
find
fault
with
this
one
as
for
the
test
this
has
a
wine
spritzer
like
quality
there
are
lots
of
lemony
and
orangey
flavors
the
beer
is
very
sweet
very
light
refreshing
and
definite
summery
aide
i
wasnt
picking
up
strong
hints
of
the
tea
but
the
lambic
is
very
evident
this
beer
is
very
naturally
carbonated
especially
right
after
the
first
pour
things
mellow
a
bit
shortly
thereafter
the
beer
is
very
low
abv
which
comes
as
no
real
surprise
because
there
is
zero
booziness
to
this
beer
not
even
hints
its
an
interesting
fizzy
almost
champaigne
like
experience
at
low
abv
this
one
does
push
the
dimensions
of
how
divergent
and
varied
beer
can
be
its
unique
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
for
more
anytime
soon
i
love
the
concept
of
this
beer
lambic
and
kombucha
is
a
great
idea
and
works
extremely
well
together
this
beer
iswell
balanced
between
the
sourness
from
the
lambic
and
the
tea
it
is
a
beer
i
pick
up
almost
every
time
i
go
to
the
liquor
store
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
it
i
really
like
this
one
i
might
try
to
track
another
down
for
a
refreshing
beverage
during
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
is
the
most
unique
lambic
i
have
ever
encountered
more
of
a
novelty
thing
i
dont
think
ill
pick
up
another
one
anytime
soon
drinking
the
entire
thing
has
made
my
stomach
feel
uneasy
and
im
usually
unaffected
by
anything
the
most
important
part
about
this
beer
is
that
my
girlfriend
would
drink
it
all
day
and
i
could
as
well
finally
my
first
review
of
an
unblended
lambic
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
this
at
dutchs
outside
of
cincinnati
it
pours
a
rich
and
severely
cloudy
apricot
orange
in
color
with
a
bright
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
it
smells
of
tea
leaves
honey
and
mint
its
a
nice
threesome
and
formidable
enough
the
flavors
are
pretty
subtle
and
the
flavor
fades
very
quickly
it
tastes
of
tea
leaves
plus
a
belgian
pale
plus
souring
yeasts
the
mix
is
kind
of
strange
and
awkward
the
finish
is
so
fast
you
have
to
ponder
what
just
happened
it
has
a
lightly
sour
tinge
that
leaves
a
leafy
minty
flavor
behind
but
like
ive
said
its
short
lived
it
drinks
a
little
too
light
and
as
ive
stated
it
finishes
fast
its
hard
for
me
to
fully
endorse
is
it
a
solid
drink
yes
is
it
worth
it
worth
the
8
99
price
tag
also
a
yes
its
two
older
styles
combined
to
make
an
interesting
beer
i
say
go
for
it
overall
very
enjoyable
and
a
charm
at
3
5
abv
well
done
id
love
a
few
in
the
picnic
basket
o
this
beer
definitely
has
a
very
unique
smell
and
taste
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
if
i
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so
d
a
light
crisp
and
mild
sour
not
really
sure
on
how
this
fits
into
the
traditional
unblended
lambic
style
but
i
sure
did
enjoy
this
ones
uniqueness
for
what
it
offers
at
the
same
time
this
is
very
inexpensive
for
the
size
of
the
bottle
and
what
you
get
i
love
this
bif
already
o
one
of
most
interesting
lambics
ive
tried
in
a
while
very
focused
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
extremely
familiar
with
kombucha
but
it
definitely
sounds
intriguing
especially
when
some
lambic
is
involved
as
well
this
concoction
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
juice
topped
by
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
fairly
rapidlydiminishing
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
lemon
zest
coriander
black
pepper
parsley
clove
and
limeade
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
lime
green
apple
cinnamon
mild
pepper
by
this
i
mean
hot
a
la
jalapeno
or
something
cilantro
and
lightly
tart
green
grapes
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sticky
feel
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
unique
brew
im
not
sure
id
actively
seek
it
out
very
often
but
it
is
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
the
appearance
is
a
orange
cloudy
body
with
a
white
frothy
head
the
nose
is
a
bready
orange
combination
with
some
lemon
lime
citrus
in
the
back
and
some
slight
pepper
and
vinegar
on
the
nose
as
well
it
may
sound
hodgepodged
but
it
actually
really
nice
the
flavor
carries
the
bready
yeast
flavor
with
it
the
flavor
i
most
prominently
get
is
an
orangecinnamon
flavor
there
is
a
touch
of
the
lemon
tartness
that
carries
throughout
the
body
i
find
everything
about
this
beer
to
be
greatly
appropriate
for
both
its
style
and
my
taste
buds
its
a
very
good
beer
i
finally
got
to
stop
in
at
the
ravedabout
the
map
room
and
immediately
felt
right
at
home
amazing
tap
bottle
selection
this
place
warrants
a
visit
all
on
its
own
but
a
quick
stop
for
a
vanberg
dewulfs
lambrucha
was
just
what
i
needed
to
strip
away
all
the
mexican
fats
flavors
of
arturos
tacos
its
probably
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
i
have
ever
tried
two
of
my
favorite
yeasty
fermented
flavors
lambic
kombucha
blended
into
one
low
abv
palate
cleansing
beverage
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
apparently
its
only
currently
available
in
chicago
d
i
liked
this
which
didnt
really
surprise
me
but
considering
what
it
really
is
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
much
of
this
at
a
fairly
high
cost
d
regardless
of
the
weird
sulfur
characteristics
all
around
it
was
still
pretty
drinkable
but
wasnt
as
tasty
as
i
thought
it
would
be
you
would
never
know
theres
was
any
tea
used
maybe
it
helps
subdue
some
of
the
barnyard
funky
i
maight
have
tasted
but
i
just
get
a
mild
puckery
palate
and
some
green
apple
skins
even
though
this
is
not
a
beer
that
ill
bring
home
again
especially
not
at
9
99
per
its
an
enjoyable
taste
of
summer
sunshine
on
a
day
when
the
mercury
will
struggle
to
reach
double
digits
bottom
line
probably
worth
the
price
for
those
who
love
the
style
dcant
stop
drinking
this
beer
due
to
the
flavor
which
is
refreshing
its
very
low
alcohol
which
helps
too
golden
clear
with
no
head
or
lace
this
doesnt
look
like
much
the
nose
is
actually
pretty
enjoyable
lemon
and
tea
are
most
noticeable
theres
a
herbal
tea
tannin
character
with
mild
spices
the
kombucha
contribution
is
rather
noticeable
as
it
warms
up
i
get
some
spruce
and
juniper
this
is
mildly
gruit
like
the
palate
is
the
same
with
more
tea
tannin
bright
sour
lemon
and
a
drying
finish
thats
got
herbal
tea
and
lemon
peel
light
body
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
drying
and
tart
solid
stuff
this
is
pretty
darned
refreshing
and
quenching
i
would
drink
this
again
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
combination
despite
the
similarities
between
kombucha
and
lambic
i
feel
that
the
former
dominates
the
flavor
and
aroma
profile
of
this
blend
perhaps
this
is
due
to
the
simplicity
of
the
lambic
that
was
blended
in
this
is
extremely
light
and
refreshing
and
this
definitely
goes
down
quite
easily
on
a
warm
summers
day
this
last
and
the
fact
that
it
is
an
interesting
use
of
kombucha
are
the
main
selling
points
for
this
worth
trying
but
i
cant
seriously
see
myself
getting
this
again
but
i
am
also
not
a
huge
kombucha
person
much
better
than
i
expected
pleasant
to
drink
albeit
not
very
complex
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
while
gardening
or
just
sitting
in
the
shade
md
it
is
a
touch
watery
especially
at
the
end
of
the
sip
but
i
would
call
it
a
successful
experiment
by
the
brewery
cheers
bottle
very
clean
aroma
slightly
herbal
and
medicinal
very
clear
with
a
pinkish
hued
color
very
clean
and
neat
taste
a
nice
blend
of
a
lambic
and
a
unsweetened
tea
not
sour
in
really
any
sense
of
the
word
fairly
carbonated
the
tea
flavor
really
doesnt
come
through
extremely
strong
but
is
more
like
a
tea
you
would
get
at
a
chinese
restaurant
with
a
lambic
twist
decently
carbonated
but
the
head
quickly
dissapates
overall
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
one
d
one
and
i
was
done
never
again
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
mind
sharing
with
others
people
said
they
might
like
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
but
it
wasnt
what
they
wanted
on
that
visit
maybe
i
was
thinking
too
much
of
my
tea
adventures
in
my
house
and
was
let
down
once
again
ill
try
it
but
probably
not
for
a
while
d
all
around
this
is
a
nice
supper
and
good
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon

value
as
well
as
being
a
little
milder
than
some
of
its
relatives
leaving
your
palate
craving
for
more
abuse
it
may
sound
strange
but
this
beer
reminds
me
of
miles
davis
bitches
brew
it
may
seem
harsh
and
biting
to
someone
that
doesnt
know
what
they
are
getting
in
to
or
to
a
mind
that
isnt
open
but
the
raw
primal
living
essence
and
soul
of
this
beer
speak
volumes
about
where
weve
been
and
where
were
going
extremely
complex
and
flavorful
for
a
beer
with
such
a
low
abv
ill
be
drinking
several
of
these
this
summer
and
i
agree
about
this
beer
being
classified
wrong
not
just
an
unblended
lambic
way
way
way
more
d
wonderfully
tart
crisp
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
and
amazingly
rich
in
aromaflavor
for
such
a
low
alcohol
beer
the
taste
is
an
intense
grapefruitlemon
tart
and
sourness
there
is
just
a
ton
of
lemon
taste
to
this
beer
the
tea
influence
then
becomes
noticeable
this
beer
just
is
the
most
interesting
mindfuck
of
a
beer
ive
ever
had
these
two
fermented
beverages
blend
perfectly
in
my
mind
and
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
think
this
isnt
the
last
you
see
of
beer
and
kombucha
blended
together
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
i
would
not
drink
it
again
though
i
did
not
enjoy
it
i
wonder
if
the
lindemanns
tea
lambic
is
similar
to
this
as
an
addendum
sure
seems
like
theres
a
lot
of
bottle
to
bottle
variation
based
on
the
reviews
some
call
this
very
funky
and
others
nonbuggy
maybe
its
a
reference
issue
or
maybe
the
yeast
and
bacteria
were
not
well
distributed
prior
to
bottling
i
wouldnt
mind
finding
a
funked
up
version
of
this
myself
d
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
very
low
its
quite
refreshing
and
to
me
its
not
offensive
it
is
strange
and
it
might
not
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
no
pun
intended
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
which
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
and
tastes
more
like
a
lambic
than
the
aroma
suggests
very
spicy
up
front
with
tight
carbonation
and
hints
of
zesty
pepper
along
with
a
slight
puckering
tartness
which
quickly
fades
into
a
slightly
creamy
lactic
center
dry
finish
the
vinegary
presence
from
the
aroma
is
the
only
sourfunky
element
of
this
beer
but
it
is
overpowered
by
the
heavy
spice
presence
and
earthy
tea
leaf
flavor
also
some
slight
acidity
the
tea
leaves
provide
a
slight
tartness
but
really
is
just
very
earthy
and
unpleasant
an
interesting
idea
that
doesnt
work
so
well
d
pretty
different
here
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
have
this
one
again
its
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
thing
this
is
one
of
those
things
that
defies
what
is
try
it
i
love
that
this
is
under
4
i
wish
i
drank
more
beer
light
like
this
but
a
whole
bottle
would
practically
kill
me
im
up
for
the
challenge
though
lamby
is
tasty
stuff
thats
worth
a
single
bottle
purchase
the
tea
works
well
with
this
tart
young
lambic
an
interesting
remix
d
very
easy
drinking
mild
as
far
as
sour
and
not
to
buggy
nice
light
stuff
i
like
it
im
interested
to
see
what
else
the
can
do
with
this
idea
drinkabiliy
was
good
not
great
because
i
could
see
getting
bored
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
and
certainly
not
wanting
any
more
after
that
this
was
pretty
unique
though
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
m
this
beer
has
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
tight
fizz
in
the
finish
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
tartness
that
is
a
bit
light
like
a
sweettart
candy
more
so
as
the
beer
warms
the
tea
blends
nicely
with
the
lambic
and
it
will
make
a
great
beer
in
warm
weather
if
you
are
a
huge
tea
fan
you
might
like
this
otherwise
it
sucks
this
is
probably
the
best
lambic
based
product
to
come
out
of
de
troch
though
ive
never
tried
their
cuvee

a
gorgeous

mingled
with
moderately
sour
notes
of

and
light
citrus
along
with
some
light
oak
and
apple
aromas
on
the
background
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
an
amazing
very
traditional
lambic
wild
barnyard
sourness
dominates
and
makes
this
a
very
pleasing
aroma
profile
despite
what
you
would
think
flavor
begins
highly
sour
with
notes
of

lemon

overall
impression

that
is
quite
refreshing
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
sour
puckering
crisp
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
light
beer
that
still
feels
somewhat
full
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
great
sour
it
fits
the
guidelines
for
a
classic
lambic
quite
nicely
and
is
incredibly
sour
complex
and
refreshing
quite
nice
overall
an
incredibly
tasty
lambic
the
younger
beer
really
shows
off
the
brighter
side
of
lambic
a
fun
journey
first
taste
was
not
really
what
i
was
expected
but
once
i
got
past
that
i
rather
enjoyed
it
nice
blend
of
oak
and
sour
funk
not
much
carbonation
although
this
was
expected
copperamber
color
a
few
small
bubbles
floating
on
top
sour
fruit
nose
nice
although
not
particularly
complex
earthy
sour
flavor
white
grapes
a
little
meatiness
nice
although
again
little
going
on
here
besides
the
sourness
relatively
thin
body
although
fine
for
the
style
overall
a
nice
sour
beer
although
probably
not
worth
the
price
tag
new
for
me
outstanding
flavor
on
the
sour
side
but
a
great
cherry
lambic
o
big
oak
and
wood
flavor
minimally
sweet
and
moderately
tart
on
the
sweet
side
overall
quite
drinkable
overall
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
bit
lighter
but
still
with
enough
soured
punch
to
pack
then
this
might
be
the
ticket
for
you
the
malty
crispness
lends
well
to
the
soured
wild
dryness
and
bite
of
the
yeast
and
bacteria
without
overly
washing
it
out
while
it
does
remain
a
highly
lightened
beer
it
keeps
true
to
style
without
allowing
too
much
carbonation
to
compromise
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
within
one
thing
that
we
felt
was
muted
actually
was
the
oak
there
was
more
dense
woodiness
through
the
taste
than
the
nose
but
still
we
were
left
wanting
we
may
have
tapped
this
one
a
bit
too
early
however
the
puck
of
tartness
while
inviting
does
take
the
first
layer
of
skin
from
the
mouth
a
bit
more
age
would
certainly
mellow
things
out
but
we
would
have
to
be
careful
as
to
not
allow
too
much
cloy
to
enter
the
picture
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
getting
into
the
world
of
sours
wilds
lambics
and
gueuzes
and
this
one
marks
another
notch
on
our
journey
to
perfection
while
it
doesnt
quite
get
us
there
we
are
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
sample
it
and
feel
that
if
youre
in
the
mood
then
this
should
do
you
fine
overall
there
arent
too
many
reviews
that
are
clearly
identified
as
being
from
this
brew
year
and
as
the
source
of
each
bottling
is
different
it
is
hard
to
compare
what
i
tasted
to
others
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
however
both
by
the
carbonation
and
the
flavor
this
is
not
the
tartest
or
the
funkiest
of
lambics
but
it
does
have
a
nice
balance
and
a
very
interesting
combination
of
flavors
at
once
fluffy
and
bitingly
crisp
the
medium
body
sits
well
and
flows
smoothly
though
its
powdery
dry
particularly
in
the
finish
it
works
quite
well
for
a
lambic
though
a
hint
of
astringency
mars
it
slightly
at
the
very
end
o
vanberg
and
dewulfs
lambickx
is
a
unique
drinking
experience
that
distances
itself
from
the
other
sour
beers
that
grace
the
shelves
layers
of
funky
complexity
burrow
deep
into
this
beer
with
tart
and
sour
components
with
descriptors
that
would
make
the
uninitiated
sour
drinker
question
why
anyone
would
consume
such
a
beer
this
blended
lambic
is
not
for
many
reasons
a
training
wheel
sour
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
for
those
who
know
what
to
expect
the
problem
with
this
one
however
is
that
brouwerij
detroch
maker
of
chapeau
some
of
the
most
pathetic
intensely
sweetened
and
artificial
tasting
lambics
ever
to
see
market
is
not
exactly
known
for
complexity
brilliance
and
drinking
excellence
this
particular
lambic
is
halfhearted
nothing
more
but
i
do
see
the
potential
for
some
great
releases
to
come
bottom
line
dont
bother
unless
you
gotta
try
every
lambic
not
as
good
as
i
wanted
this
to
be
the
201011
vintage
in
oak
and
chestnut
it
pours
a
still
apple
jiuce
color
not
bubbles
at
all
hazy
but
sunny
and
bright
still
the
nose
is
really
funky
authentic
lambic
smelling
with
lactic
tartness
and
high
acid
content
lots
of
citrus
too
smells
wild
and
strong
it
fills
the
room
with
its
funky
aromatics
the
taste
is
a
little
more
subtle
sour
only
in
the
finish
with
rustic
wheat
malt
and
lemon
juice
making
up
the
bulk
of
the
taste
as
it
warms
a
yellow
grapefruit
complex
really
comes
out
fleshy
grapefruit
is
the
exact
flavor
its
uncanny
i
have
a
real
problem
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
i
know
its
one
vintage
of
lambic
and
is
supposed
to
be
this
way
but
it
makes
it
hard
to
get
into
it
i
want
sour
beer
like
this
to
resonate
and
sing
this
just
falls
short
of
that
by
quite
a
bit
its
almost
dead
on
the
palate
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
at
23
bucks
or
so
per
bottle
it
is
absurdly
overpriced
i
know
there
are
a
number
of
vintages
and
barrels
released
of
this
and
others
may
exhibit
other
characteristics
but
at
this
price
i
am
unlikely
to
continue
experimenting
with
lambickx

slightly
acidic
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
lambic
style
very
dry
with
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
wood
and
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
with
no
carbonation
and
light
acidity
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
this
unblended
lambic
was
neither
too
acidic
nor
too
sour
so
it
wasnt
that
difficult
to
drink
o
im
on
a
big
time
lambic
kick
right
now
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
i
cant
say
the
price
was
worth
more
than
a
single
try
overall
good
but
lacks
complexity
worth
a
try
an
interesting
look
into
how
lindemans
beers
taste
premassive
fruit
addition
not
the
best
lambic
ever
and
certainly
pricy
for
what
it
is
but
interesting
nonetheless
definitely
lie
carbonation
but
a
nice
sourness
color
is
cloudy
as
expected
nose
is
light
with
hints
of
apple
initial
flavor
is
medium
sour
with
apple
finishes
tart
and
a
bit
flat
overall
a
decent
sour
for
a
festival
sampling
but
not
the
best
for
just
drinking
alone
o
not
as
tart
or
funky
as
some
of
the
other
beers
in
this
style
which
is
most
similar
to
a
gueze
rather
than
a
lambic
unblended
as
it
is
in
fact
a
blend
of
lambics
all
from
the
same
year
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
for
newbies
to
the
style
well
worth
the
price
tag
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
lemon
and
funk
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
lemon
and
funky
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
smells
slightly
better
in
my
opinion
a
very
good
lambic
that
is
seemingly
sitting
on
shelves
nearly
everywhere
around
me
at
least
even
though
it
was
last
made
in
2011
perhaps
this
is
due
to
the
steep
price
tag
so
was
it
worth
the
25
it
asks
for
well
id
be
hard
pressed
to
spend
that
now
that
ive
already
had
it
but
i
would
certainly
encourage
other
lovers
of
the
style
to
pick
one
up
if
they
havent
had
it
before
i
wouldnt
have
been
upset
at
all
had
i
been
the
one
to
finally
purchase
the
bottle
overall
solid
beer
if
you
like
lambics
and
dont
bat
an
eye
at
spending
2030
bucks
for
a
bottle
of
beer
buy
it
its
worth
a

great
stuff
amazed
that
this
doesnt
have
more
love
on
the
site
but
its
probably
because
its
such
a
nice
little
humble
lambic
rather
than
something
puckery
and
insane
this
is
an
everyday
lambic
if
ive
ever
had
one
one
that
you
can
take
to
picnics
or
have
during
a
warm
day
to
refresh
yourself
if
the
oak
were
heavier
it
would
definitely
be
a
more
restrained
beer
but
luckily
its
not
and
comes
off
as
simply
an
easy
flavorful
unique
beer
to
drink
want
to
turn
people
on
to
sourish
beers
this
is
a
good
one
to
choose
however
dont
pay
a
fortune
for
it
if
you
can
help
it
it
seems
that
my
bottle
was
very
different
from
the
others
that
i
have
seen
reviewed
i
imagine
that
a
lot
has
to
do
with
which
batch
you
pick
up
mine
was
the
zenne
valley
private
domain
brewed
in
2009
and
bottled
in
2011
for
the
price
i
paid
i
was
extra
disappointed
by
this
one
yet
based
on
the
reviews
i
can
see
why
i
was
not
the
only
one
with
a
letdown
after
paying
around
25
at
binnys
south
loop
i
am
entitled
to
express
some
angst
the
aroma
was
a
sour
grape
aroma
if
you
were
deciding
whether
to
eat
the
hypothetic
grape
on
smell
alone
you
would
probably
put
it
back
on
the
intial
taste
one
detects
dry
grape
skin
and
faint
sweet
berry
in
the
background
as
others
have
pointed
out
it
tastes
a
little
more
like
a
farmhouse
than
a
lambic
with
the
lemon
notes
as
many
others
have
pointed
out
this
lambic
is
disturbingly
flat
the
carbonation
makes
me
think
the
bottle
was
never
corked
in
belgium
in
fairness
i
probably
will
not
being
buying
another
bottle
of
this
unless
somebody
wants
it
in
trade
this
was
great
my
first
unblended
lambic
and
it
was
quite
delicious
vomit
smell
along
with
some
great
citrus
lemony
hues
pours
nicely
little
to
no
head
absolutely
amazing
color
golden
like
a
saison
taste
like
a
lemony
farmhouse
brew
super
tangy
very
minimal
carbonation
with
a
nice
dry
finish
will
definately
grab
more
if
i
stop
by
that
spot
o
this
is
the
first
unblended
lambic
that
ive
had
so
i
can
only
base
my
thoughts
on
style
guidelines
but
i
think
that
this
beer
fits
the
style
nicely
even
though
its
a
bit
heavier
on
the
funky
side
it
has
a
nice
balance
between
tart
and
brett
flavors
its
tasty
and
certainly
drinkable
for
a
sour
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
probably
a
defect
of
some
kind
but
my
bottle
was
flat
as
a
clam
sea
looks
yellow
and
dull
strong
aroma
but
hard
to
place
smells
a
little
fruity
and
yeasty
maybe
strawberry
the
initial
taste
is
nothing
but
sourness
and
that
doesnt
change
much
nor
does
the
thin
mouthfeel
if
this
is
any
example
i
dont
think
i
care
much
for
lambics
though
as
i
said
above
there
may
have
been
something
wrong
with
the
bottle
after
half
a
glass
i
didnt
want
to
drink
any
more
overall
pretty
good
lambic
in
my
book
nice
tart
notes
some
nice
slight
fruit
sweetness
as
the
beer
warms
the
beer
really
balances
between
some
fruity
yeast
esters
and
the
sour
notes
overall
i
dig
it
do
i
dig
it
for
25
would
i
buy
again
not
sure
im
lucky
to
live
in
a
land
rich
with
beer
but
i
dont
regret
trying
it
one
bit
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
for
the
unblended
lambic
style
but
lack
the
sophistication
of
a
20
dollar
a
bottle
beer
might
be
better
aged
but
as
a
beer
seeker
might
say
at
the
price
worth
a
try
but
with
the
caliber
not
worth
a
revisit
cheers
overall
muted
flavors
but
theyre
all
pretty
nice
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
its
belgian
counterparts
i
know
this
bottle
is
pretty
pricey
around
22
in
these
parts
and
i
wouldnt
pick
another
one
up
at
that
price
overall
wow
at
25
for
this
i
feel
cheated
smells
of
barnyard
funk
musty
lemon
peels
and
granny
smith
apples
mediumlight
ocean
breeze
with
plenty
of
oaken
driftwood
and
a
light
apple
vinegar
tart
acidity
tastes
of
an
even
blend
of
the
apples
lemons
and
vinegar
with
a
medium
leathery
funkiness
and
a
hay
wooden
oak
tannic
astringency
element
that
frames
things
quite
nicely
this
is
only
a
moderately
acidic
lambic
the
emphasis
seems
to
be
on
achieving
a
balance
between
the
sourness
funk
and
woody
elements
that
allows
each
to
costar
without
fighting
each
other
overall
this
is
ok
but
not
great
on
the
good
side
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
but
this
one
is
not
full
bodied
enough
to
be
a
great
lambic
subtlety
is
well
played
in
this
rustic
ale
as
the
finer
qualities
are
light
but
certainly
worth
the
concentration
i
love
the
downplayed
sourness
in
favor
of
mature
earthiness
throughout
overall
a
solid
lambic
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
i
really
liked
this
blend
not
the
most
complex
with
a
lot
of
heavy
oak
but
its
definitely
good
for
a
singlevintage
blend
solid
poured
this
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
small
foamy
offwhite
head
that
quicly
subsided
color
is
a
clear
straw
amber
with
a
dozen
or
so
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
very
volatile
blend
of
yeast
oak
leather
fruit
bit
of
malt
flavors
like
nose
yeast
and
carbonic
tang
unite
up
front
and
provide
a
zesty
backdrop
for
the
fairly
dry
bitter
other
qualities
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
for
the
style
and
good
burps
too
finish
is
fairly
long
satisfying
like
a
good
brut
champagne
and
has
a
wisp
of
alcohol
warmth
excellent
beer
this
is
an
initially
potent
lambic
but
lightens
in
flavor
the
rawness
is
interesting
o
overall
a
very
nice
lambic
i
had
never
heard
of
this
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
nose
was
lightly
funky
and
the
taste
had
even
more
sourness
and
funk
would
definitely
look
to
get
more
of
this
one
carbonation
what
there
is
is
soft
lighter
body
with
no
alcohol
feel
this
is
a
really
nice
unique
sour
the
latest
offering
from
this
importergoneindependent
beer
creator
and
blender
each
batch
of
lambickx
is
a
blend
of
lambics
gueuze
tasted
and
selected
by
vd
founder
don
feinberg
wonderful
complexities
up
front
however
the
flavor
is
short
lived
regardless
fans
of
the
style
should
seek
this
out
pretty
nice
product
here
i
am
sure
it
will
hold
up
for
a
year
or
two
but
will
it
get
better
only
time
will
tell
this
one
seems
a
bit
full
in
flavor
in
a
way
that
hampers
a
display
of
complexity
but
it
still
brings
a
lot
of
the
character
i
expect
for
the
style
seems
a
bit
lactic
but
it
all
comes
together
nice
mildly
funky
tones
with
some
citrus
in
the
mix
as
well
its
pleasant
to
drink
and
fits
the
style
for
sure
if
this
were
cheaper
and
by
cheaper
i
mean
a
lot
cheaper
i
could
drink
more
of
this
on
the
regular
great
flavor
as
well
solid
lactic
sourness
does
scorch
the
palate
or
linger
too
long
oak
is
both
well
balanced
and
tasty
still
very
beer
like
i
can
taste
the
wheat
and
doesnt
have
a
bone
dry
body
like
a
lot
of
lambics
but
by
no
means
sweet
worth
a
try
true
to
style
poured
a
hazy
straw
low
carbonation
it
smells
dry
and
woody
a
sweet
funk
sort
of
comes
through
at
the
end
sort
of
like
a
funky
musty
apple
the
taste
is
similar
lactic
and
nice
very
to
style
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
elegant
i
find
this
the
most
pleasing
part
of
the
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
for
the
price
18
00
though
not
the
best
i
thought
this
to
be
more
prototypical
of
the
lambic
genre
of
beer
750
ml
corked
bottle
drank
out
of
a
duvel
tulip
hazy
golden
yellow
color
little
to
no
head
but
the
carbonation
is
present
while
drinking
and
well
balanced
sour
musty
fruity
the
sourness
is
definitely
present
and
the
main
feature
but
not
overpowering
pretty
well
balanced
overall
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
dirty
sanded
tarnished
gold
in
color
with
a
white
lacing
it
smells
of
funk
a
boatload
of
brett
apparently
bat
guano
according
to
a
colleague
and
a
tad
fruit
sour
funk
laiden
nose
the
flavors
are
very
dry
and
bretty
it
has
a
very
acetic
sour
the
flavors
are
ever
so
slightly
fruity
with
a
heaping
truckload
of
brett
and
funk
this
is
heavy
on
barnyard
for
sure
its
light
and
well
carbonated
its
a
nice
sour
is
it
different
than
most
marginally
i
do
like
it
though
beer
is
light
in
body
and
has
this
sort
of
funky
sour
finish
to
it
an
interesting
lambic
for
sure
but
not
a
very
strong
funk
or
sour
easy
drinking
for
sure
id
probably
have
it
again
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
im
pretty
sure
the
label
says
this
is
a
blended
lambic
so
the
style
probably
needs
to
be
changed
anyway
the
flavor
profile
is
relatively
simple
and
very
satisfying
i
dont
always
have
an
easy
time
describing
lambics
but
i
do
really
enjoy
them
anyway
definitely
worth
a
try
the
flavor
is
a
good
blend
of
acidity
and
funk
its
more
toward
the
cantillon
and
tilquin
end
of
the
spectrum
though
it
has
a
bit
more
funk
than
either
of
those
without
quite
as
much
acidity
really
nice
lemon
rind
and
puckering
lactic
acidity
throughout
dry
and
funky
light
body
with
spritzy
carbonation
and
a
nice
dry
sour
finish
really
impressive
o
exceptional
i
enjoyed
every
drop
and
happy
to
pay
the
hefty
price
for
the
beer
and
will
do
so
again
very
tasty
and
a
beer
that
farmhouse
and
gueze
lovers
can
applad
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
another
even
after
the
sour
sips
keep
producing
belches
that
clear
my
nasal
passages
and
airway
with
a
slight
acidic
burn
doesnt
induce
acid
reflux
like
some
of
the
really
sour
jolly
pumpkin
beers
here
in
the
states
o
the
is
a
good
gueuze
but
over
priced
for
what
you
are
getting
i
enjoy
this
and
happy
i
tried
it
but
i
would
probably
not
get
this
due
to
the
fact
that
stuff
like
tilquin
drie
fonteinen
and
cantillon
when
available
for
less
this
was
a
fun
one
to
try
im
holding
another
for
a
future
year
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
it
sits
on
the
shelves
i
know
the
22
is
what
causes
this
for
me
to
enjoy
whenever
im
willing
to
splurge
maybe
not
cantillon
level
but
a
good
readily
available
substitute
was
excited
for
this
one
v
and
d
know
their
belgians
and
while
perfectly
quaffable
its
just
another
mediocre
lambic
sold
at
a
premium
price
point
perhaps
v
and
d
blended
to
their
own
sweet
spots
and
we
just
have
different
tastes
oh
well
its
always
fun
trying
new
lambic
pours
a
mostly
clear
bright
golden
color
bone
white
crackling
head
forms
and
then
recedes
to
nothing
aromas
of
pear
lemon
citrus
damp
hay
musty
basement
and
white
vinegar
in
the
taste
nice
lactic
twang
acetic
edge
lemon
rind
and
grapefruit
pith
funky
with
a
nice
sour
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
lighter
bodied
almost
thin
medium
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
overall
a
solid
quasigueuze
and
the
importers
vanberg
dewulf
know
how
to
blend
some
lambics
has
aging
potential
sitting
on
a
bottle
indefinitely
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
a
tame
blend
that
falls
off
toward
the
finish
lighter
bodied
and
not
as
complex
funky
or
tart
as
i
prefer
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
kind
of
mediocre
compared
to
other
options
in
the
style
o
very
good
gueuze
tons
and
tons
of
funk
tart
not
super
sour
though
very
good
gueuze
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
ive
had
in
a
while
bottles
are
expensive
but
i
will
probably
grab
another
before
they
are
all
gone
o
a
decent
lambic
but
a
little
simple
when
you
take
the
beer
in
its
entirety
cant
really
complain
about
having
another
lambic
offering
this
was
a
good
find
for
me
i
love
the
style
and
this
is
well
made
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
when
it
comes
to
funk
and
acidity
but
something
i
would
recommend
wow
quite
impressive
im
hooked
don
keep
them
coming
very
fun
hazy
white
gold
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
nose
is
brine
sour
grapefruit
fresh
wood
lemon
green
apple
skin
freshly
paved
country
road
greenwhite
grapes
and
must
taste
is
mellow
balanced
and
drinkable
enough
tartness
to
let
you
know
it
means
business
and
hints
of
acid
elevate
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
not
super
sour
grapefruit
and
sheepycheesy
notes
rule
the
flavor
profile
to
me
notes
of
wheat
and
spice
come
through
as
well
finishes
nice
and
cobwebby
like
a
grapefruit
stuck
in
a
cobweb
soft
medium
body
that
goes
down
way
too
easily
and
carries
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
overall
a
very
drinkable
lambic
blend
lots
of
tough
competition
here
for
high
ratings
but
this
will
definitely
hold
its
own
against
the
standard
big
boys
great
to
see
this
happen
more
please
big
thanks
for
my
friend
jen
for
picking
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
sharing
it
with
me
and
a
few
other
people
we
know
this
brew
poured
out
into
a
wine
glass
gave
off
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
that
fizzled
away
rather
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
tart
and
funky
much
like
a
typical
gueuze
should
smell
the
taste
was
also
tart
and
acidic
flavors
coursing
through
the
beer
the
taste
was
still
tolerable
though
and
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
on
the
light
side
it
was
dry
like
and
leaving
a
tingle
on
the
taste
buds
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
drinkable
gueuze
i
cant
say
that
id
purchase
a
bottle
for
myself
or
anything
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
some
o
slightly
less
carbonated
than
most
classic
alternatives
funk
is
well
presented
in
the
nose
and
rivals
that
from
the
best
of
the
style
taste
on
the
other
hand
doesnt
follow
suit
funk
is
not
as
strong
as
it
could
be
mouthfeel
is
too
smooth
for
me
and
general
acidic
twang
isnt
as
prevalent
other
than
that
this
is
not
bad
quite
enjoyable
if
you
can
grab
one
then
buy
two
if
you
dont
like
it
trade
me
the
extra
bottle
o
this
is
classified
as
gueuze
but
im
not
sure
thats
really
accurate
the
bottle
describes
it
as
lambic
and
indicates
its
aged
2
years
rather
than
a
mix
of
different
years
the
level
of
carbonation
is
also
quite
low
although
most
gueuze
wouldnt
referment
this
rapidly
either
but
despite
these
stylistic
uncertainties
i
still
find
this
rather
enjoyable
ill
probably
try
to
find
another
bottle
and
cellar
it
for
a
couple
years
to
see
if
it
picks
up
carbonation
o
very
nice
sourlambic
very
light
barnyard
aromatics
a
worthy
beer
for
the
27
tag
big
citrus
flavors
at
first
lemony
with
some
grapefruit
and
a
slight
creamy
cheesiness
too
tannic
bitterness
moderate
puckering
sourness
bone
dry
oaky
aftertaste
slightly
honeyish
medium
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
nice
work
on
this
lambic
its
legit
and
highly
drinkable
if
i
had
to
wager
a
guess
maybe
its
a
2
year
old
lambic
from
de
cam
as
vd
imports
them
also
o
excellent
pricey
but
this
is
perfect
for
summertime
sipping
and
would
be
extremely
versatile
with
food
yeah
it
was
expensive
but
dammit
sometimes
ya
just
gotta
splurge
amiright
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
hazy
tawnystraw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest

rind
light
lime
peel
tart
pineapple
sour
green
apple
flesh
spicy
white
grapes
and
a
touch
of
oak
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
all
of
the
fruits
really
coming
into
their
tart
own
a
small
splash
of
white
vinegar
and
a
very
brief
cobweb
encounter
round
out
the
highlights
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
allaround
my
buddys
girlfriend
more
of
a
wine
drinker
really
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
pour
and
went
back
for
seconds
and
thirds
i
would
have
followed
suit
but
i
knew
other
beers
were
waiting
in
the
wings
and
i
wanted
my
buds
in
prime
condition
good
times
quite
a
wonderful
blend
and
they
did
a
nice
job
of
selecting
lambics
to
create
this
gem
i
cant
wait
until
their
next
one
and
hope
to
find
lambrucha
one
day
bottle
to
stemless
white
wine
glass
looks
alright
but
very
orange
and
a
little
opaque
for
its
type
smells
like
heartburn
in
a
glass
heavy
sour
and
citrus
tastes
good
sour
and
pear
mouthfeel
is
busy
and
heavily
carbonated
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
think
its
way
overpriced

lighter

fruit
skin
and
tartness
in
the

nice
tartness

d
it
was
easy
to
drink
mike

i
destroyed
the
750ml

a
bit
of
carbonation
might
brighten
the
flavors
up
although
too
much
might
overaccentuate
the
woodsy
character
unfortunately
there
are
better
options
at
this
price
point
so
its
unlikely
ill
see
how
this
develops
over
time
o
not
a
bad
beer
became
very
easy
to
drink
and
alex
and
i
did
the
bottle
together
without
much
trouble
not
a
great
gueuze
and
probably
not
worth
the
price
tag
but
had
some
good
characteristics
its
okay
maybe
even
good
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
where
a
gueuze
can
start
from
a
good
jumping
off
point
to
further
explain
why
i
dont
like
this
beer
the
citric
acidlike
possibly
a
mixture
of
lactic
and
citric
really
flavors
dont
just
hit
you
they
destroy
you
like
drinking
a
bit
of
water
oversaturated
with
warhead
powder
you
arent
left
with
anything
complex
from
acidity
and
just
a
burnt
out
feeling
with
bitter
tastes
overall
id
say
this
is
a
very
solid
lambic
blend
its
not
a
style
that
i
am
super
familier
with
but
one
im
getting
to
know
more
and
more
ill
have
to
see
how
this
compares
to
the
cantillon
classic
gueuze
i
have
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
it
was
certainly
worth
trying
im
not
sure
this
would
be
the
best
lambic
normally
however
the
gratuitous
dryhopping
makes
it
more
than
interesting
serving
type
bottle
nice
sour
taste
but
a
horrible
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
off
putting
and
harsh
will
not
drink
again
great
beer
its
the
hidden
magic
fou
foune
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
but
a
real
unique
animal
with
giant
fruit
quality
mix
of
sweet
and
muted
tangy
sour
quality
and
aging
could
be
argued
made
a
difference
but
man
i
dont
have
the
patience
for
this
kind
of
thing
just
stick
it
in
my
veins
i
really
dont
like
this
style
and
dont
understand
that
people
would
like
something
that
taste
like
bile
or
vomit
beer
should
be
pleasant
and
not
be
like

overall
this
is
an
above

with

the

i
am
getting
is

seems

the
ale
really
shows
a
lot
of
complexity
but
in

for
the
drinker
those
smoky

flavors
are
a
few
of
the
intangibles
that
are
hard
to
include
in
proper
balance
no
such
worry
here
overall
its
pretty
good
not
the
most
interesting
profile
o
feels
a
little
too
dirty
and
homebrewlike

this

that

the
taste
doesnt

my
opinion
lot
of
oak
on
the
tongue
very
tannic
and
earthy
fruity
cidery
some
bitterness
too
actually
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness

hoppy

an
herbalearthy

moderate
not
bracing
by
any
means
with
no
noticeable

tons

more
of

curious

really
well
served
as
oude
lambic
at
in
de
verzekering
tegen
de
grote
dorst
in
eizeringen
belgium
while
the
specific
age
wasnt
disclosed
i
am
guessing
that
the
1year
girardin
on
this
site
refers
to
the
jonge
young
version
of
up
to
a
year
old
it
was
decanted
somewhere
out
of
view
and
arrived
in
the
house
glassware
a
simple
straightsided
tumbler
the
color
was
dusky
amber
more
farolooking
than
the
typical
unblended
lambic
there
was
just
a
bit
of
froth
that
immediately
dissipated
like
on
a
glass
of
moroccan
tea
with
no
trace
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
i
was
prepared
for
lambicbreweryloftfunk
smells
but
was
blindsided
by
a
strong
bolt
of
dry
cider
some
applepeel
sourness
and
a
bit
if
applebruise
sweetness
overall
like
sticking
your
head
into
the
bottom
of
the
sack
brought
home
from
the
orchard
the
flavor
departed
the
cider
theme
with
a
smoky
complexity
plus
a
grapefruity
tartness
and
a
little
flick
of
brown
sugar
to
leaven
the
sourness
and
make
for
a
clean
finish
if
we
didnt
have
a
train
to
catch
we
would
have
stayed
and
had
much
more
given
its
rather
unique
allround
character
all
marks
stated
are
for
the
lambik
style
m
cloying
but
nice
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
last
word
bring
some
toothpaste
because
your
breath
will
smell
like
you
vomited
after
drinking
this
crazy
stuff
the
beer
poured
a
dense
cloudy
yellow
straw
color
with
a
nice
12
head
the
nose
is
has
some
fresh
citrus
and
apple
character
to
it
the
taste
starts
out
a
tad
bitter
and
has
some
pepper
notes
after
while
a
nice
apple
taste
and
orange
as
well
comes
through
the
taste
is
a
bit
herbal
as
well
no
real
sour
or
tart
taste
very
easy
drinking
it
is
wonderful
to
taste
such
a
fresh
lambic
straight
from
the
barrel
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
to
get
more
of
this
md
although
this
young
lambiek
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
and
complexity
that
is
more
common
to
older
lambieks
the
pungent
and
superbly
dry
palate
still
makes
this
a
lovely
sample
of
the
unblended
sour
beer
the
key
thing
was
the
condition
of
the
beer
in
cask
if
i
had
got
this
halfpint
several
hours
earlier
the
drink
might
have
shown
a
bit
more
liveliness
and
pronounced
flavour
had
on
tap
at
in
de
verzekering
tegen
de
grote
dorst
listed
as
oude
lambic
so
placing
it
here
not
sure
how
many
years
it
has
on
it
though
the
pour
is
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
some
dusty
attic
notes
with
a
touch
of
cheesy
funk
light
dough
and
some
appricot
peach
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
little
funk
doughy
in
the
middle
light
lactic
notes
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
tasty
appricots
barely
sour
in
the
finish
with
a
light
body
soft
feel
and
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
cheers
it
was
clear
dark
golden
color
and
completely
still
all
the
time
in
the
barrel
definitely
took
the
fizz
out
but
it
didnt
stay
long
enough
to
get
overly
oxidized
i
got
some
wheat
grain
in
the
flavor
easier
to
detect
in
the
still
versions
and
a
very
nice
counterpoint
to
the
lactic
tartness
no
real
acetic
component
this
was
more
flavorful
with
all
the
things
i
could
ask
for
that
grow
in
dank
dark
areas
delicious
i
cant
believe
so
few
reviews
for
this
one
ill
try
it
again
any
time
d
very
drinkable
quaffable
could
drink
this
all
night
long
i
drank
this
3
yr
old
lambic
from
one
of
the
huge
expilsner
urquell
1000
ltr
oak
casks
at
the
de
cam
stekerij
during
my
visit
at
easter
2002
up
until
then
the
oldest
unblended
lambic
that
i
had
ever
drunk
was
2
yrs
old
this
3
yr
old
was
almost
completely
flat
but
did
have
some
trace
carbonation
a
dark
golden
amber
color
it
was
murky
but
not
muddy
feint
dank
smells
you
could
almost
imagine
yourself
wandering
through
the
deep
damp
cellars
that
contain
the
pipes
foudres
of
slowly
aging
lambics
there
really
is
very
little
aroma
other
than
this
so
it
is
hard
to
mark
i
give
it
3
0
because
for
the
style
this
is
not
uncommon
apparently
on
reflection
perhaps
this
is
a
little
harsh
it
is
definitely
not
average
but
exceptional
the
brettanomyces
brothers
bruxellensis
lambicus
had
done
their
work
well
in
this
batch
and
produced
an
awesome
majestic
sourness
coupled
with
a
taste
of
farmyard
mustiness
wet
hay
horses
mushrooms
cobwebs
damp
walls
with
hints
of
sherry
this
was
just
the
most
amazing
beer
tasting
to
which
words
simply
cannot
do
justice
at
times
it
felt
like
a
microbiological
experience
soon
to
continue
its
long
journey
and
be
blended
with
younger
lambics
to
form
the
next
batch
of
de
cam
gueuze
subsumed
forgotten
forever
thanks
must
go
to
the
de
cam
blender
karel
goddeau
for
allowing
us
to
steal
some
of
this
key
ingredient
what
a
treat
but
rarely
seen
tasted
or
sold
as
a
3
yr
old
unblended
lambic
what
an
absolutely
tragic
shame
a
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
cmrillo
for
bringing
this
one
out
during
his

the

was
comprised
of
sweet

the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
cherry
and
subtle
vinegar
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
this
was
my
first
time
experiencing
an
unblended
lambic
in
cask
form
it
was
really
quite
interesting
all
of
the
flavors
were
very
delicate
rather
than
being
bold
and
in
your
face
this
one
was
quite
still
from
a
carbonation
standpoint
im
really
glad
that
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
d
this
was
very
interesting
to
try
its
surprisingly
sweet
and
gentle
perhaps
to
mild
to
be
truly
amazing
it
lacks
some
character
but
it
was
tasty
and
rather
refreshing
overall
quite
an
interesting
brew
and
im
very
thankful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
it
recommended
served
from
a
traditional
stoneware
crock
that
had
been
filled
from
the
barrel
this
beer
was
completely
flat
it
had
a
lemony
sour
aroma
with
a
hint
of
mustiness
to
it
lightly
sour
completely
dry
and
devoid
of
sweetness
tastes
a
bit
of
grapefruit
with
a
hint
of
pepper
spiciness
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
astringency
as
well
could
be
detected
overall
quite
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
my
strongest
flavor
association
is
one
of
grapefruit
given
its
rather
unique
allround
character
all
marks
state
are
for
the
lambik
style
pours
a
dark
golden
amber
transparent
creamy
off
white
head
and
a
lot
of
lace
the
nose
offers
sweet
caramel
and
candied
fruit
with
a
touch
of
a
metallic
twang
and
some
light
cherry
behind
the
taste
is
a
little
more
put
together
still
very
sweet
notes
of
lemon
zest
and
some
lightly
soured
cherry
on
top
of
caramel
and
candied
sugars
lighter
body
soft
on
the
palate
and
very
creamy
decent
carbonation
and
a
semi
dry
finish
golden
orange
brown
pour
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
spicy
aromas
that
carry
into
the
flavor
along
with
candied
fruit
some
nuttiness
too
reminding
me
of
a
port
without
the
wine
backbone
good
body
and
a
long
lasting
terrific
finish
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
i
really
wonder
how
girardin
makes
this
beer
it
is
likely
a
blend
with
a
bit
of
lambic
in
it
and
some
caramel
color
quite
weird
in
some
ways
i
am
really
not
quite
too
sure
what
to
think
in
the
end
this
is
a
bit
simplistic
but
still
nice
very
enjoyable
beer
would
definitley
try
again
pours
amber
big
yeast
bananna
bread
aroma
thick
and
foamy
head
good
retension
the
yeast
smells
and
tastes
much
more
like
the
strains
used
in
hefeweizens
rather
than
most
belgian
beers
ive
had
still
very
good
fruit
malt
wheatyeast
goes
down
very
smooth
mfd
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
chewy
and
breadlike
coated
the
mouth
well
with
its
slight
thickness
definitely
a
great
beer
and
worth
hunting
down
i
drank
the
entire
bottle
while
watching
the
ncaa
championship
game
and
looked
for
more
when
i
was
done
i
had
this
with
a
friend
this
past
weekend
after
we
finished
a
bottle
of
chimay
red
label
the
vos
has
a
similar
smeel
taste
and
feel
to
it
but
it
has
a
little
more
bite
than
the
chimay
i
prefer
the
chimay
to
this
one
but
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
you
can
shave
with
the
amount
of
foam
head
that
comes
out
of
the
bottle
goes
down
smooth
too
and
like
i
said
with
a
little
more
bite
than
the
chimay
other
comments
we
had
intended
on
having
a
late
lunch
here
but
since
they
only
take
cash
and
the
kbc
bank
in
the
square
wouldnt
accept
my
ing
card
i
had
to
settle
for
a
beer
only
so
i
went
for
this
one
which
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
it
was
served
very
cold
from
the
tap
in
a
small
tapered
glass
though
the
serving
temperature
was
probably
too
cold
for
a
real
tasting
cheers
overall
nice

nothing

the

alcoholic

warming
lambic
ive

was
appreciated
also
the

quite
acidic

refreshingly

overall
a
quality
sour
ale
a
coolship
done
right
still
not
at
all
a
replica
of
belgian
lambic
its
more
like
a
sour
brown
it
is
more
palatable
than
any
unblended
lambic
ive
had
however
id
have
this
again
overall
not
bad
couldnt
do
more
than
the
6
oz
though
on
tap
at
the
federal
taphouse
in
lancaster
pa
flat
appearance
with
the
fruit
and
sour
hitting
the
nose
a
lot
of
bang
in
the
taste
with
pucker
to
the
end
that
has
you
going
right
back
for
another
sip
outstanding
sour
that
i
will
hope
to
sample
again
someday
served

no

no

whew
anyone
have
some
fries
or
rather
chips
to
go
with
all
this
vinegar
acetic
acid
overload
and
just
about
nothing
else

medium

chewy
fairly
drinkable
but
i
really
wouldnt
go
back
for
a
second
pour
of
this
one
im
not
sure
id
call
this
a
lambic
overall
this
is
closer
to
an
unblended
oud
bruin
or
something
nothing
close
to
traditional
belgian
lambic
but
enjoyable
in
its
own
right
bottle
courtesy
of
johndoe8
served
in
a
mini
snifter
pours
a
clear
still
golden
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
nose
has
a
bit
of
acetone
along
with
some
lactic
acidity
a
bit
of
a
stone
fruit
character
in
the
background
though
not
all
that
much
still
with
a
strange
acidity
not
my
favorite
though
not
a
terrible
first
effort
id
like
to
see
if
they
can
develop
a
program
and
improve
on
this
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
solvency
of
it
overwhelmed
any
nice
character
it
might
have
had
there
are
bright
spots
in
the
beer
like
the
dry
finish
with
a
mild
oakiness
and
tartness
but
the
forward
and
midpalate
are
dominated
by
the
acetone
flavor
that
is
just
too
hard
to
drink
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
the
beer
is
hazy
and
golden
hued
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
offers
some
nail
polish
barrels
citrus
smells
eh
the
flavor
and
feel
both
bring
a
sharp
harsh
palate
attacking
acetic
character
virtually
no
carbonation
with
a
lingering
sharpness
some
vinegar
as
well
maybe
not
as
appalling
as
i
described
but
i
wont
be
having
this
again
a
delicious
sour
i
would
love
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
very
good
beer
came
out
to
alpine
for
the
beer
week
releases
didnt
get
anything
luckily
this
was
on
tap
into
tulip
poured
a
golden
hazy
hay
color
much
like
all
the
ipas
no
head
very
little
carb
bubbles
nose
is
musty
acidic
bite
tartness
taste
is
tart
sharp
and
sssliightly
acidic
a
bit
dry
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
it
goes
well
with
the
flavor
profile
not
much
carb
out
of
this
one
but
small
bubbles
spark
up
when
it
hits
the
tongue
very
thankful
to
have
tried
this
worth
the
journey
deasy
dis
this
from
southern
california
or
belgium
excellent
stuff
that
is
so
tasty
yet
not
overdone
a
truly
outstanding
job
for
an
american
lambic
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
lambic
fruit
oak
and
funk
were
in
well
balanced
abundance
with
my
only
gripe
being
just
a
touch
too
much
souring
character
in
the
back
which
inhibited
the
drinkibility
a
bit
for
me
mouthfeel
has
a
thin
body
with
very
mellow
carbonation
that
is
just
enough
to
be
noticeable
this
one
is
a
sipper
due
to
the
depth
of
the
acidic
sourness
i
was
glad
i
shared
this
bottle
as
even
a
375ml
might
be
too
much
for
one
person
thanks
to
sfoley333
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
notes
from
92608
i
have
sat
on
this
one
since
the
release
earlier
this
year
finally
opened
a
bottle
tonight
and
poured
into
my
delirium
tremens
snifter
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
no
head
even
with
aggresive
pouring
to
lure
one
out
smell
is
mixture
of
sour
orchaid
fruits
intertwine
with
acetic
acid
brett
more
cheese
and
not
barnyard
and
oak
taste
is
sour
lemon
tartness
with
a
green
apple
profile
again
there
is
the
vingear
present
but
not
as
sour
as
the
unblended
lambic
style
with
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
not
as
dry
as
lot
of
sour
beers
uncarbonated
and
while
apprioate
for
the
styleunblend
lambics
should
be
uncarbonated
i
really
believe
that
overall
it
would
of
been
better
off
with
a
low
to
medium
carbonation
level
considering
the
mild
to
slight
intense
sour
leveland
since
its
made
in
alpine
and
not
belgium
but
respect
pat
authenticity
in
the
style
a
very
drinkable
lambic
reproduction
on
par
with
cantillon
grand
cru
bruocsella
but
diffently
not
for
beginners
to
sour
style
beers
not
near
as
good
as
their
chez
in
my
opinion
overly
tarty
for
my
palate
and
i
almost
choked
after
a
few
different
sips
still
a
good
lambic
indeed
though
just
glad
i
got
to
try
this
rare
treat
because
there
was
not
much
of
it
to
go
around
it
sold
out
at
alpine
pretty
quickly
from
what
i
understand
would
like
to
drink
it
again
and
compare
various
bottles
recommended
if
you
can
still
find
one
d
a
nice
level
of
drinkablity
with
most
lambics
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
more
than
one
but
as
my
glass
empties
partially
my
fault
i
find
myself
wanting
to
open
another
briscoe
so
different
from
their
other
stuff
kind
of
disappointing
o
a
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
delicate
flavors
but
not
overly
complex
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
the
pour
is
a
hazy
goldenyellow
color
with
a
tall
white
head
smells
really
really
funky
rice
anise
lots
of
barnyard
and
tons
of
yeast
sort
of
a
sake
like
aroma
to
it
a
bit
of
citrus
and
bread
too
light
lactic
tartness
on

the

is
similarly
interesting
intense
funk
of
yeast

bacteria
sake
rice
light
mildew
and
barnyard
definite
anise
some
malt
citrus
peel
and
lemon
i
actually
thought
this
was
pretty
good
any
beer
labeled
lambic
or
wild
ale
is
one
i
am
game
to
try
and
if
its
from
japan
all
the
more
reason
this
was
certainly
unique
but
for
a
lot
of
reasons
i
am
not
entirely
digging
i
am
routinely
down
for
trying
odd
and
unusual
foods
or
beers
from
different
areas
but
this
beer
strikes
me
as
too
far
eastern
struck
the
honey
tones
interesting
i
suppose
but
none
of
this
really
hits
me
as
pleasant
the
beer
makes
me
think
too
much
and
i
already
do
that
enough
as
it
is
pours
a
slightly
murky
watery
brown
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
cap
no
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
of
grains
spices
citrus
and
yeast
taste
is
very
yeast
forward
almost
belgian
yeast
flavored
grains
and
lemonycitrus
flavors
no
real
funky
or
tart
smells
or
flavors
on
this
one
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
a
simple
carefully
crafted
beer
with
little
in
common
with
the
listed
style
though
it
embodies
a
pleasing
connection
to
nature
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
nice
beer
and
highly
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
with
some
light
tartness
the
flavor
is
tart
with
sour
lemons
and
sour
wheat
notes
overall
a
relatively
low
level
of
tartness
but
the
finish
is
quite
tart
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
a
japanese
lambic
but
im
always
up
for
a
new
spontaneously
fermented
beer
the
japanese
craft
brewers
are
really
doing
some
great
and
interesting
experimentation
this
is
no
exception
i
think
any
champagne
lover
would
get
a
kick
out
of
this
as
its
got
a
winelike
quality
and
its
well
on
par
with
the
likes
of
temptation
and
belgian
gueuze
d
yes
please
nuit
de
japon
at
dieu
de

and
one
of
two
beers
enjoyed
on
tap
from
this
unique
brewer
wild
yeast
and
open
fermentation
dark
colour
with
noticeable
lace
funky
aroma
carbonation
is
right
there
glad
i
waited
a
couple
hours
mouthfeel
ok
taste
is
wine
grapey
with
chocolate
malt
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
i
liked
this
one
more
than
i
anticipated
perhaps
even
more
than
the
lou
pepe
gueuze
opened
the
night
before
just
slightly
effervescent
the
mostly
flat
oily
mouthfeel
is
more
akin
to
wine
than
what
i
am
used
to
in
a
beer
the
nose
is
beautiful
in
a
funky
way
barnyard
hay
and
earth
the
funk
carries
to
the
flavor
but
there
is
also
a
bright
lemoncitrus
quality
and
an
overall
lightness
that
is
greatly
balanced
the
acidity
is
moderate
and
allows
the
delicate
qualities
of
the
lambic
to
shine
through
at
first
the
flatness
was
off
putting
but
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
i
wished
it
wouldnt
end
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
in
my
opinion
underrated
tasted
like
it
might
have
been
slightly
skunked
will
have
to
revisit
in
the
future
to
verify
tastes
awful
not
even
slight
carbonation
overall
a
good
experience
i
definitely
know
now
what
a
gueuze
tastes
like
before
it
is
blended
worth
a
try
biterness
is
moderated
and
fruity

cool
pours
deep
golden
colored
with
no

and
no
real

coming
up

is

white

oak
vinegar
some
sugar
sweetness
flavor
is
honey
apples
vinegar
lightly
sour
funky
yeast
notes
a
bit
of
buttery
influence
and
drinks
very
much
like
a
super
smooth
chardonnary
no
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
this
was
very
interesting
pretty
unique
and
something
id
order
again
in
place
of
white
wine
o
mellow
complex
and
unique
striking
for
what
it
is
but
not
as
good
as
the
lou
pepe
gueuze
this
is
not
my
favorite
cantillon
because
it
shows
less
complexity
than
a
blend
as
in
a
geuze
and
i
do
miss
the
carbonation
however
it
is
still
a
cantillon
and
it
is
always
nice
to
experience
a
brew
from
this
magical
place
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
cantillon
while
the
sourness
is
low
by
cantillon
standards
this
one
is
hugely
funky
and
complex
it
really
provides
a
similar
drinking
experience
to
a
good
wine
this
one
doesnt
get
the
same
the
same
amount
of
love
as
their
other
offerings
but
it
ranks
right
up
there
with
most
of
cantillons
other
regular
offerings
high
b
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
with
the
proper
expectations
and
letting
it
warm
considerably
it
is
not
nearly
the
same
sourfunk
experience
as
the
other
cantillons
ive
had
but
still
a
good
quality
beer
if
youre
into
the
style
overall
not
super
complex
tastes
a
lot
like
classic
geuze
but
flat
an
interesting
take
on
the
lambic
cool
to
try
but
if
i
had
the
choice
between
classic
geuze
and
bruocsella
i
would
take
classic
anytime
overall
this
is
alright
but
not
as
bold
and
flavorful
as
some
others
in
the
style
i
would
take
a
de
cam
lambic
over
this
nine
times
out
of
ten
for
example
still
this
one
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
making
it
a
perfect
lambic
to
open
on
any
occasion
give
this
a
shot
if
you
get
the
chance
just
be
sure
to
try
others
in
the
style
as
well
recommended
this
is
so
far
my
least
favorite
cantillon
i
have
tried
maybe
the
lack
of
bubbles
has
something
to
do
with
it
an
amazing
beer
to
relax
with
just
not
digging
the
stale
justbeforethesnowflies
must
that
has
wound
its
way
into
the
dna
of
this
beer
decent
enough
but
easily
my
least
favorite
of
the
pantheon
we
experienced
during
after
the
trip
overall
not
a
fan
of
the
no
carbonation
despite
it
being
that
way
on
purpose
lacking
a
bit
in
flavour
as
well
compared
to
other
offerings
nice
to
have
tried
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
o
love
it
great
place
to
start
with
cantillon
i
like
it
but
dont
quite
love
it
seeing
how
i
dont
think
ive
had
unblended
lambic
before
so
personal
taste
may
weigh
in
here
more
then
normal
cheers
ian
for
bringing
it
over
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
it
reminds
me
of
a
flat
gueuze
with
a
mustier
and
dark
fruit
aspect
to
it
worth
trying
but
ill
pass
going
forward
overall
its
fantastic
really
deep
flavors
verdict
a
nice
unblended
lambic
from
cantillon
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
makes
this
a
hard
beer
to
drink
the
flavors
never
really
come
to
life
and
everything
is
somewhat
muted
by
the
still
nature
of
the
beer
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
but
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
regularly
regardless
of
it
being
traditional
as
a
three
year
old
unblended
lambic
it
just
is
light
years
beyond
the
enjoyability
i
get
from
drinking
almost
anything
else
in
the
cantillon
lineup
toss
this
one
and
mamouche
on
their
rears
focus
on
everything
else
they
make
because
theyre
all
world
class
to
me
when
you
exclude
those
two
o
good
drinkability
not
the
best
cantillon
ive
had
but
still
a
classic
recommended
o
i
enjoy
a
still
lambic
every
now
and
then
but
i
still
prefer
them
to
be
carbonated
i
like
the
aromas
and
flavors
but
this
just
isnt
one
of
the
cantillons
i
would
seek
out
great
to
try
it
but
that
was
fine
for
me
its
a
straight
lambic
pours
a
clear
amber
color
no
carbonation
here
smell
is
mildly
lactic
with
belgian
barnyard
funk
mixed
in
taste
is
about
the
same
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
buttery
plenty
of
funk
and
an
soft
apple
bite
at
the
end
its
a
little
thin
but
thats
expected
from
a
100
lambic
overall
i
was
really
glad
to
have
a
couple
of
these
its
very
one
dimensional
like
a
building
block
for
doesjel
or
a
close
runner
up
to
lambickx
overall
this
is
nice
enough
but
i
preferred
the
2
year
old
blended
lambic
that
i
had
the
same
day
id
have
more
o
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
i
wish
it
had
some
carbonation
that
might
have
changed
my
opinon
of
this
beer
o
not
much
else
to
say
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
one
3
overall
this
beer
is
great
im
glad
i
have
a
few
bottles
tucked
away
nothing
too
bad
here
and
probably
hurt
my
opinion
that
i
had
it
the
same
day
as
cantillons
best
but
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
id
normally
enjoy
drinking
a
glass
of
this
but
would
prefer
other
fruited
or
more
flavorful
options
when
i
want
to
reach
for
a
sour
beer
overall
its
a
little
unvaried
if
i
could
say
the
word
but
its
a
solid
lambic
backbone
for
taste
and
easily
drinkable
but
i
think
i
am
looking
for
just
more
sour
apple
zero
lace
smell
is
of
funky
barnyard
and
a
ton
of
fruit
bits
of
balsamic
with
essential
flavors
deep
and
vivid
would
love
to

solid

this
may
need
to
score

my
lack
of
experience
with
these
offerings
alongside
what
i
perceive
challenges
offered
by
the
brew
with
a
notion
of
overall
quality
made
this
ratings
what
they
are
having
said
that
the
brew
felt
like
a
rare
and
difficult
treat
rather
pleasing
in
small
servings
but
with
a
marked
sour
and
vinegar
character
that
is
a
challenge
to
most
palates
over
the
long
run
however
if
one
is
interested
in
beer
varieties
and
experiencing
a
quality
unblended
lambic
this
is
quite
the
brew
i
guess
that
outside
of
its
ecosystem
this
works
best
shared
with
beer
enthusiasts
d
quaffable
another
gem
from
the
worlds
best
brewery
nice
acid
mouthfeel
is
that
considered
an
oximoron
im
not
sure
why
i
assumed
that
an
unblended
lambic
would
be
more
funky
than
the
blended
guezes
but
thats
not
the
case
at
all
this
beer
is
not
tart
there
is
no
sulfur
character
not
a
lot
of
funk
drinkability
is
high
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
its
not
what
i
expected
pours
still
amber
and
cloudy
aromas
of
tart
strawberry
with
tropical
notes
such
as
pineapple
and
notes
of
light
cheese
and
butter
i
believe
that
the
lack
of
carbonation
does
not
allow
the
aromas
to
be
fully
expressed
flavor
is
vinous
with
apples
and
a
tropical
fruit
explosion
before
the
tart
finish
though
not
as
tart
as
the
gueuzes
of
cantillon
or
girardin
the
lack
of
carbonation
detracts
from
the
experience
as
the
bubbles
often
give
the
tartness
a
nice
pop
still
a
complex
and
wonderful
beer
that
stands
up
to
the
other
cantillon
offerings
overall
im
glad
i
finally
get
to
taste
an
unblended
lambic
however
now
i
see
why
theyre
normally
blended
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
but
it
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
normally
found
by
adding
and
augmenting
one
beer
with
another
still
very
well
worth
a
shot
if
for
nothing
but
education
solid
beer
that
keeps
me
sipping
away
its
more
dry
and
flavorful
than
any
wine
but
far
more
than
just
a
beer
perfect
for
what
cantillon
is
j
overall
seems
like
it
could
be
a
good
lambic
and
tastes
pretty
good
just
dead
flat
which
i
really
dont
enjoy
drinkability
is
high
i
could
down
this
much
more
easily
than
your
typical
sour
beer
drinkability
is
very
easy
due
to
the
lack
of
funk
i
prefer
an
elegant
lambic
but
not
my
favorite
dgood
beer
though
a
little
strange
is
this
my
favorite
lambic
or
even
my
favorite
cantillon
no
is
it
good
and
at
least
worth
a
try
yes
d
this
is
very
drinkable
although
mostly
because
of
the
very
mild
taste
id
have
preferred
things
the
other
way
around
huge
flavor
lower
drinkability
as
there
are
lots
of
less
expensive
session
brews
to
be
had
out
there
drinkability
is
great
supremely
drinkable
and
just
mellow
enough
to
bring
the
funk
without
getting
overdone
or
bland
excellent
offering
from
cantillon
cheers
a
very

and
a
fun
beer

complete

journey
to
try
all
listed

d
a

from

i
cant
say
i
was
terribly
impressed
since
i
hold

in

regard

im

sour

funky
not

with

md
astringent
dry
feel
like
cooking
wine
and
really
thin
the
drinkability
is
difficult
do
to
the
poor
taste
and
astringent
feel
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
though
admittedly
acquired
indulgence
one
is
sufficient
for
late
evening
or
possibly
as
a
cocktail
overall
definitely
interesting
enough
and
tasty
worth
a
look
havent
met
a

i
didnt
like
and
this
one
is
certainly
no

d
a
beer
to
be
drank
by
someone
who
appreciates
the
style
thats
for
sure
and
even
then
its
a
challenge
the
nonexistant
carbonation
is
quite
weird
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
would
i
search
it
out
probably
not
md
the
texture
is
very
smooth
or
slick
even
as
no
carbonation
is
felt
against
a
moderate
body
making
this
beer
truly
like
wine
or
liquor
in
the
glass
my
very
last
encounter
with
any
old
lambic
was
girardins
at
last
years
gbbf
bsf
bar
and
the
memory
is
quite
hazy
that
i
cant
make
any
responsible
comparison
here
but
this
revisit
shows
this
beer
as
a
truly
unique
offering
if
not
a
truly
great
one
due
to
the
quiet
performance
overall
pours
golden

with
no

very

should

picked
up
a
bottle
of
the
2005
while
in
ghent
cork
says
it
was
bottled
in
2007
overall
a
tasty
and
relatively
drinkable
though
not
sweet
gueze
that
oddly
enough
had
almost
no
carbonation
but
i
guess
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
the
lemonlime
juice
taste
really
dominates
this
beer
though
musty
barnyard
notes
creep
in
behind
the
fruit
and
come
on
stronger
in
the
aroma
worth
a
try
but
really
i
havent
met
a
cantillon
beer
i
havent
liked
yet
d
drinkable
out
of
interest
in
the
different
and
odd
but
a
bit
disappointing
really
i
could
see
it
becoming
an
acquired
taste
if
i
had
easier
access
2005
vintage
the
beer
is
a
completely
still
gold
colored
liquid
its
mostly
clear
with
just
a
slight
amount
of
haze
zero
head
and
zero
carbonation
the
aroma
is
really
interesting
here
the
first
sensation
is
of
oak
like
a
white
wine
aged
in
oak
barrels
that
scent
is
followed
by
more
expected
citrusy
lemony
horsey
musty
funky
wildness
wonderful
aroma
the
taste
is
dry
and
mouthpuckeringly
sour
its
not
as
intense
a
sourness
as
i
expected
and
seems
to
have
been
softened
by
the
aging
this
makes
the
beer
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
other
cantillons
light
easy
to
sip
and
interesting
not
quite
as
complex
or
intense
as
it
could
be
but
this
is
instead
a
refined
subtle
sophisticated
and
very
approachable

gueuze

this

this

it
does
not
give
any
sort
of

there
is
absolutely
no
visible
carbonation
belive
me
i
looked
the
color
is
however
a
quite
clear
and
atractive
shade
of
gold
the
smell
well
its
like
a
punch
in
the
nose
you
can
smell
it
from
across
the
room
sour
sour
sour
a
bit
of
funk
the
taste
is
rather
underwhelming
quite
one
diminsional
its
just
sour
with
a
touch
of
oak
tannins
on
the
side
of
my
tounge
its
even
more
sour
than
the
smell
gave
away
the
mouthfeel
was
like
wine
completely
flat
i
would
not
want
to
drink
a
whole
12oz
pour
of
this
beer
in
fact
i
was
a
bit
tired
of
it
after
about
6
oz
broucsella
is
interesting
a
unique
not
quite
finished
beer
and
quite
fun
if
you
like
lambics
i
dont
know
of
anything
else
like
it
but
its
not
really
a
good
beer
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
its
cantillon
brethren
and
the
drinkability
of
well
most
anything
else
a
good
beer
to
have
at
least
once
after
that
id
spend
your
money
on
one
of
cantillons
superior
offerings
this
beer
pours
and
orangy
amber
with
no
carbonation
so
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sour
almost
like
lemonade
the
taste
is
nice
and
complex
some
nice
malt
flavors
in
there
with
some
sourbitter
lemon
flavors
as
well
nearly
no
carbonation
and
a
mild
dry
aftertaste
didnt
help
the
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
actually
an
easily
drinking
beer
for
all
the
things
going
on
just
not
the
flavor
wow
in
my
opinion
for
the
price
tag
this
deal
is
obviously
solid
and
then
some
drinks
very
nicely
is
enjoyable
as
hell
but
as
mentioned
is
a
little
tight
for
more
than
one
or
two
still
awesome
the
pour
was
decent
enough
with
a
clear
dark
grape
juice
looking
liquid
with
only
the
slightest
bit
of
carbonation
sticking
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sour
tart
notes
hints
of
a
woody
or
oak
like
touch
with
a
vanilla
touch
to
it
small
notes
of
cherry
or
some
light
fruit
notes
as
i
take
a
taste
the
feel
really
throuws
me
off
it
is
almost
like
oily
water
no
carbontion
and
slick
feeling
really
distracting
the
bite
of
tart
apples
is
lightly
offset
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
finish
nothing
too
bad
at
all
but
nothing
blowing
me
away
just
a
touch
one
to
put
down
the
tartness
was
not
strong
enough
and
the
subtle
hints
of
oak
too
light
to
make
a
difference
my
least
favorite
cantillon
beer
to
date
d
dit
is
extreem
the
flavor
opens
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
almost
immediately
overtaken
by
funk
sourness
and
more
sourness
very
light
and
super
attenuated
with
minimal
carbonation
bright
green
apple
sourness
with
cheesy
mousy
flavors
unripened
peaches
a
bit
grassy
very
puckering
the
sour
finish
dominates
lasts
long
in
the
aftertaste
dry
as
a
desert
intense
stuff
this
is
a
standout
for

goes
down
quite
well
d
ill
treat
this
as
a
novelty
i
suppose
i
wanted
to
taste
where
gueuze
comes
from
and
now
i
know
trying
this
makes
me
appreciate
gueuze
all
the
more
my
curiosity
is
satisfied
no
more
unblended
lambic
for
me
d
this
ones
a
little
rough
for
my
palette
hazy
golden
color
with
a
few
soapy
bubbles
but
basically
no
head
sour
aroma
with
grapefruit
and
stinky
cheese
musky
and
woody
flat
and
watery
with
a
good
body
everything
in
this
beer
is
subtle
but
delicious
its
drinkability
is
higher
than
most
lambics
ive
had
dquite
refreshing
and
amazingly
highly
drinkable
hold
your
nose
and
enjoy
the
master
funk
of
brett
d
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
you
may
want
to
try
it
to
experience
an
unblendrf
lambic
but
its
not
something
i
would
make
a
habit
up
especially
given
the
price
tag
interesting
yes
pleasant
not
so
much
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
bright
orange
color
there
is
no
head
the
aroma
is
of
barnyard
orange
peel
green
apples
minerals
oak
and
happiness
the
taste
is
of
green
apples
followed
by
barnyard
bretta
with
a
dry
puckering
sour
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
lambic
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
d
not
my
favorite
style
considering
that
its
still
not
as
drinkable
as
id
like
i
dont
think
ill
try
this
one
again
because
the
price
is
a
bit
much
for
my
income
and
i
dont
think
it
blew
me
away
the
way
an
18
beer
should
but
it
was
still
nice
to
try
especially
for
fans
of
the
style
i
had
never
seen
this
particular
cantillon
beer
around
so
decided
that
it
might
be
good
for
a
hot
day
like
today
poured
in
to
a
wine
glass
as
suggested
an
orange
amber
color
with
quite
literally
no
head
at
all
aroma
is
typical
for
a
cantillon
brew
with
lemon
grass
yeast
some
funk
etc
taste
is
of
fresh
lemons
oranges
grain
and
some
slight
vinegar
this
one
is
not
quite
as
mouth
puckering
as
some
of
the
other
brews
i
have
sampled
from
this
brewery
perhaps
the
age
of
this
beer
has
calmed
it
down
a
bit
body
is
my
only
real
gripe
with
this
beer
there
is
no
carbonation
whatsoever
i
suppose
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
in
their
comparing
it
to
a
chardonnay
but
i
like
at
least
some
fizz
in
my
beer
a
bottle
was
rather
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
imo
but
not
something
that
i
will
be
purchasing
again
i
will
stick
with
the
iris
d
well
i
hate
to
waste
beer
but
most
of
this
one
is
going
down
the
sink
i
tried
to
enjoy
it
but
i
would
rather
have
water
than
this
one
its
just
not
my
thing
slightly
hazy
golden
pour
with
zero
head
whatsoever
smells
like
a
dirty
medicated
bandaid
musty
funky
bacteria
laden
taste
is
completely
bland
acidic
tartness
no
balancing
malt
zero
carbonation
and
feels
like
drinking
rancid
bile
water
not
an
example
of
the
style
that
i
enjoyed
and
i
found
this
very
hard
to
drink
unfortunately
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
better
on
tap
than
the
bottled
version
noncarbonation
works
surprisingly
well
for
this
sour
interesting
change
from
the
aggressive
foaming
of
say
a
geuze
with
similar
flavors
d
definitly
a
great
single
blended
lambic
that
will
leave
you
puckering
from
the
sourness
and
wanting
more
very
acidic
and
tart
ive
heard
all
sorts
of
scary
things
about
real
lambics
not
those
stickysweet
fruit
lambics
that
qualify
as
chick
beer
about
how
theyre
hardedged
uncompromising
extremely
variable
from
batch
to
batch
and
so
on
broucsella
1900
grand
cru
is
pretty
easy
to
live
with
and
the
first
half
has
gone
well
enough
when
its
all
said
and
done
though
i
dont
think
ill
be
plunking
down
the
cash
for
another
bottle
i
had
this
bottle
in
my
refrigerator
for
quite
a
while
waiting
for
the
perfect
time
to
open
it
and
i
finally
just
decided
to
open
it
with
dinner
tonight
i
paired
it
with
honey
mustard
glazed
basa
fillets
and
sauteed
green
beans
and
garlic
i
was
afraid
the
sweet
glaze
on
the
fish
would
clash
with
the
sour
beer
but
it
was
an
excellent
match
it
was
happy
surprise
that
the
beer
contained
some
mustard
notes
that
further
complimented
the
glaze
the
beans
were
more
ambivalent
but
the
sourness
of
the
lambic
complimented
the
garlic
in
a
nice
way
off
notes
from
62007
pours
a
hazed
gold
with
a
funky
nose
surprise
surprise
flavor
is
a
load
of
tangy
oranges
the
liquid
feel
is
thicker
than
i
usually
expect
lambics
to
be
its
good
not
my
favorite
lambic
really
but
still
pretty
decent
just
a
bit
too
tangy
for
my
likes
is
all
hmmn
after
lots
of
various
lambics
and
guezes
i
believe
this
is
my
forst
still
unblended
lambic
i
definitely
prefer
blended
ambics
and
some
carbonation
that
said
it
is
what
it
is
poured
absolutely
still
and
golden
just
the
tiniest
bit
hazy
the
smell
is
very
light
with
lemon
sourness
up
front
followed
by
some
light
barnyard
aromas
and
finishing
with
a
spritz
of
acetic
aroma
taste
is
sour
and
slightly
herbal
up
front
sorta
like
orange
juice
tastes
after
brushing
your
teeth
this
is
followed
by
flavors
of
ripe
soft
cheese
and
some
oaky
tannic
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
still
tannic
and
a
litttle
puckery
not
really
my
style
but
interesting
to
try
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
never
again
some
string
provel
cheese
will
go
nicely
with
the
next
glass
a
delicate
somewhat
reserved
lambic
no
doubt
due
to
the
three
years
of
aging
in
oak
barrels
not
my
personal
favorite
of
the
cantillon
offerings
but
pleasant

outstanding
big
thanks
to
realale
for
this
fine
brew
the
beer
is
pretty
straightforward
with
the
flavor
imagine
a
fruit
lambic
without
any
sweetness
from
the
fruit
and
you
have
this
beer
not
as
a
gentle
as
some
gueuzes
this
is
just
straight
up
sourness
loved
it
and
it
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
for
lambic
lovers
overall
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
i
liked
it
and
would
definately
have
it
again
tough
beer
to
review
not
like
others
ive
had
poured
into
a
flute
its
a
dark
yellow
with
no
carbonation
it
looks
like
a
glass
of
wine
an
intriguing
fruity
musty
aroma
with
perhaps
a
little
spice
sour
fruit
apple
taste
very
still
i
initially
didnt
like
it
but
as
it
warmed
a
little
and
i
got
used
to
it
i
began
to
enjoy
it
more
ill
probably
try
it
again
this
is
a
well
puttogether
beer
and
you
can
tell
there
is
a
lot
of
quality
and
thought
to
this
however
it
just
doesnt
come
together
as
well
as
youd
hope
there
are
definitely
better
lambics
out
there
very
interesting
and
recommended
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
i
picked
this
up
for
9
which
for
a
cantillon
750
seems
like
a
hell
of
a
deal
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
and
would
love
to
have
more
lying
around
for
myself
thin
pungent
sourness
soon
fills
out
and
envelops
the
tongue
funky
and
powerfully
sour
the
sourness
remains
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
mouth
is
very
lightly
carbonated
nearly
flat
for
cantillon
its
fairly
drinkable
although
a
sipper
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
will
be
a
regular
ahhh
man
cantillon
is
the
unquestioned
master
of
lambics
and
this
is
a
prime
example
of
what
i
am
talkin
about
yeah
interesting
but
for
me
cantillon
makes
far
superior
and
more
interesting
brews
if
i
want
something
tart
hand
me
their
gueze
the
oak
adds
some
interesting
notes
but
not
much
imo
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
taste
profile
and
i
enjoy
it
as
a
onceinawhile
treat
good
stuff
when
craving
something
tart
poured
from
750ml
bottle
slightly
chilled
into
a
wine
glass
hazed
golden
hue
very
delicate
and
still
with
a
light
ring
of
froth
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
sour
apple
in
the
nose
tart
upfront
which
isnt
so
harsh
after
the
first
sip
sour
mashbretty
tastes
dominate
the
flavor
but
a
light
pear
or
apple
infused
white
wine
no
idea
what
grape
is
noted
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
light
with
a
puckering
sour
finish
very
enjoyable
easy
enough
to
drink
drink
it
slow
however
and
appreciate
its
complexities
i
remarked
that
while
this
could
be
found
at
whole
foods
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
served
in
shea
stadium
anytime
soon
as
one
needed
a
lot
of
time
to
go
over
it
to
find
its
reason
of
being
this
has
a
thickwater
feel
that
is
mineral
rich
as
though
the
water
sat
in
a
cistern
for
a
long
while
it
has
the
affect
that
i
get
upon
chewing
on
some
fresh
biodynamic
spinach
the
corners
of
my
mouth
are
itchy
with
minerals
and
acid
the
oak
is
puckering
the
body
is
as
soft
as
the
favorite
parts
of
my
lover
did
someone
sqeeze
a
fruit
tree
through
a
juicer
here
this
is
so
dry
except
for
a
keel
of
honey
thinned
with
green
apple
juice
a
couple
drops
of
tropical
fruit
essence
and
grain
soaking
water
the
sourness
is
so
pervasive
but
smooth
sip
after
sip
gives
me
pleasure
that
is
both
relaxing
and
inpsiring
this
is
a
real
transport
beyond
time
this
kind
of
pleasure
is
why
people
smoke
a
pin
joint
every
evening
or
pour
a
couple
fingers
of
bourbon
or
scotch
or
light
aromatherapy
candles
around
the
bathhot
tub
this
is
gentle
relaxation
it
is
the
definition
of
idle
time
well
spent
a
good
lambic
as
all
cantillons
ive
sampled
have
been
however
i
find
the
mouthfeel
to
be
way
to
thin
on
this
one
i
think
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
cabonation
or
at
least
strength
to
balance
the
acidity
overall
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
lou
pepe
kriek
or
the
rosé
de
gambrinus
the
qualities
that
cause
the
taste
score
to
suffer
increase
the
score
for
drinkability
though
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
wickedly
tart
yeast
aroma
very
nice
im
not
picking
up
any
oak
barrel
scents
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
malt
flavor
that
seems
a
bit
weak
and
watery
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
highly
tart
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
but
it
lacks
mouthfeel
and
a
real
malt
presence
one
of
the
best
unscrewedwith
beers
out
there
i
really
appreciate
what
cantillon
accomplished
with
this
brew
a
very
tart
sour
smelling
and
tasting
brew
woven
into
a
lightly
hazed
canary
yellow
colored
thinly
laced
liquid
no
head
retention
and
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
its
perfect
unblended
and
unadulterated
goodness
has
a
light
citrus
lemon
and
limes
flavor
with
grannysmith
apple
and
a
light
berry
flavor
mildly
vineous
and
woodsy
lightly
musky
and
powdery
intense
sourness
quickly
gives
way
to
an
ultra
clean
crisp
feel
lightly
astringent
and
a
tad
grainy
to
be
expected
flavors
are
fleeting
and
the
body
finishes
abruptly
the
perfet
summertime
thirst
quincher
ideal
to
style
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
almost
no
head
theres
no
lacing
at
all
the
kind
of
appearance
youd
expect
from
an
unblended
lambic
the
smell
is
funktastic
lots
of
sour
and
tart
aromas
nothing
much
else
to
it
yet
nothing
else
is
needed
its
intoxicating
the
taste
is
nice
and
funky
up
front
lots
of
that
classic
cantillon
musty
flavors
its
too
bad
though
because
the
flavor
drops
off
rather
quickly
where
the
hell
did
all
the
flavor
go
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
and
watery
but
again
thats
expected
from
this
style
the
drinkabiliy
is
wonderful
though
and
nonlambic
lovers
could
easily
handle
this
one
personally
id
prefer
a
gueze
or
a
framboise
without
the
carbonation
the
tartness
can
be
very
overpowering
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
wholly
unique
brew
and
i
highly
recommend
it
this
was
a
unique
experience
this
is
my
first
beer
with
almost
no
carbonation
i
liked
it
i
prefer
cantillon
gueuze
or
vignerrone
but
this
is
a
very
worthy
complex
and
funky
lambic

i
had
very
mild
heartburnacid
indigestion
when
i
drank
this
beer
on
the
review
date
a
few
days
later
i
had
major
heartburn
when
trying
the
2003cork
fou
fonne
where
i
actually
noted
it
in
the
review
yesterday
i
had
another
2005cork
grand
cru
and
noted
the
same
mild
heartburn
sensation
i
have
had
nearly
all
of
cantillons
products
over
a
number
of
years
and
these
two
are
the
only
times
i
have
felt
this
and
i
still
drink
other
products
from
them
regularly
not
sure
if
this
is
a
products
of
a
particularly
strong
lambic
year
2002
maybe
or
some
other
specific
attribute
i
had
older
versions
of
grand
cru
in
the
past
with
nary
a
symptom
edit
i
have
since
bumped
up
the
scores
for
this
beer
as
i
have
grown
to
love
sour
beers
these
adjustments
are
based
on
my
assumption
that
should
i
be
fortunate
enough
to
get
my
hands
on
this
beer
again
i
cant
help
but
think
id
be
a
lot
more
into
it
drinkability
not
bad
almost
wine
like
one
of
these
is
enjoyable
every
now
and
then
if
you
are
in
the
mood
but
this
is
not
a
beer
i
can
have
every
night
a
friend
brought
this
back
while
on
a
business
trip
we
drank
it
on
new
years
eve
while
counting
down
to
midnight
another
friend
had
been
raving
about
cantillon
for
months
and
i
was
glad
to
finally
get
to
taste
one
of
their
beers
we
poured
it
into
flute
glasses
and
it
basically
had
no
head
and
very
little
visible
carbonation
aroma
was
sour
and
earthy
and
the
taste
was
about
the
same
with
a
little
fruitiness
finish
was
very
dry
and
tart
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
have
very
many
true
lambic
style
beers
but
i
certainly
liked
this
one
despite
some
rude
comments
from
some
non
beer
drinkers
in
the
room
regarding
the
smell
and
taste
we
both
found
the
beer
to
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
would
probably
go
very
well
with
some
strong
cheeses
and
fruit
hopefully
ill
have
the
opportunity
to
try
more
of
their
beers
the
pour
is
totally
still
save
for
the
few
bubbles
resulting
from
the
rough
pour
looking
straight
down
at
the
beer
there
appears
to
be
an
oil
slick
on
top
with
this
beer
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
the
same
sour
funky
barnyard
hay
and
fresh
dirt
kind
of
tart
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
is
great
with
the
surf
and
turf
if
paired
with
just
the
lobster
tail
it
wouldnt
go
so
well
the
key
is
the
filet
seared
on
each
side
and
finished
in
the
oven
mmm
d
an
interesting
solidly
produced
beer
the
tartness
and
acidity
make
it
a
strong
choice
for
the
special
once
in
a
while
brew
something
worth
revisiting
from
time
to
time
i
can
imagine
this
being
excellent
with
a
meal
to
lessen
the
tartness
apathy
it
instills
after
at
time
taste
its
smoother
than
some
of
the
other
cantillons
ive
had
the
previlege
to
sample
in
the
past
its
not
as
astringent
and
mouthpuckering
as
i
would
like
but
still
has
a
nice
refreshing
acidity
d
this
is
very
smooth
and
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
flavors
from
the
barnyard
the
tartness
and
crisp
refreshing
taste
makes
this
really
refreshing
i
guess
the
age
has
really
made
this
smooth
what
a
drinker
pristinely
clear
goldorange
tinny
in
tone
but
shiny
as
all
get
out
light
head
on
top
gets
supported
by
plenty
of
tight
carbonation
scents
are
all
layers
of
tartness
bretty
spices
and
herbs
and
a
malt
ravaged
by
all
types
of
things
i
dont
attempt
to
understand
exceptionally
clean
clear
flavor
just
exploding
with
balanced
tart
and
sour
with
the
raw
funk
of
nature
tons
of
slick
malts
behind
it
all
with
pils
kilned
sweetness
and
wheat
twisted
by
wild
yeast
carbonation
is
a
dream
sprite
yet
soft
an
amazing
effect
and
aids
the
flavor
tons
slick
and
complex
damn
like
the
brueghel
painting
i
could
drink
this
by
the
tankard
on
a
fall
night
can
we
get
more
unblended
lambics
please
a
fascinating
experience
as
the
lack
of
barrel
blending
makes
a
for
a
clear
and
singular
flavor
profile
2003
pours
an
orange
color
with
no
carbonation
and
no
head
aroma
has
a
lot
of
sour
notes
along
with
some
fruity
hints
the
flavor
is
extremely
smooth
i
believe
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
flows
really
well
on
the
palate
lots
of
sour
flavors
in
there
and
some
fruits
that
i
cant
pick
out
because
of
the
sourness
the
mouthfeel
seems
extremely
thin
but
this
could
be
caused
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
if
you
like
sour
beers
this
one
is
a
good
one
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
very
nice
clarity
light
chunk
fell
into
the
glass
before
i
could
stop
it
a
very
nice
looking
brew
no
bubbles
are
present
suggesting
a
still
beer
the
nose
is
divine
acrid
sour
and
tart
but
not
offensive
at
all
lemony
and
funky
acidic
i
dig
it
a
lot
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
and
unoffensive
i
get
a
lemon
start
to
the
beer
before
swallowing
after
swallowing
the
light
sourness
and
acidic
nature
hits
but
nowhere
near
as
strong
as
others
ive
had
the
sourness
does
not
linger
at
allmoving
to
a
slightly
sweet
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
with
no
carbonation
slightly
sticky
spit
hangs
on
my
tongue
but
not
too
much
incredibly
drinkable
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
its
a
toned
down
gueuze
that
makes
the
drinking
very
easy
i
guess
that
was
the
only
bad
incident
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
did
not
enjoy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
its
too
much
like
their
other
beers
the
sour
smell
was
a
clear
upfront
indicator
i
couldve
been
drinking
any
other
cantillon
lambic
here
sidebysidedness
would
not
help
plus
it
wasnt
too
carbonated
either
and
the
saltyness
id
felt
before
was
still
there
mellowed
out
cellared
bottle
just
a
mellow
cantillon
sounress
and
oak
flavour
but
well
done
on
that
account
went
well
went
varied
with
a
doppleback
and
a
mead
cloudy
yellow
with
no
lace
medium
mouthfeel
with
acid
that
was
tolerable
tart
dry
finish
hell
yes
this
is
a
benchmark
offering
and
a
very
rare
chance
to
get
to
try
and
understand
a
traditional
3
year
old
lambic
try
it

love
it
remarkably
drinkable
for
such
a
gnarly
style
mostly
due
to
the
proper
temperature
and
nice
carbonation
bartended
wanted
to
puke
when
i
ordered
it
i
think
he
steers
people
off
it
cork
says
bottled
in
2004
pours
a
glowing
hazy
straw
color
with
absolutely
no
head
there
is
coating
of
fine
bubbles
all
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
very
tart
flavor
almost
like
lemon
juice
but
not
quite
as
puckering
this
flavor
is
balanced
by
a
cider
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
there
is
lemon
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
much
more
subdued
and
joined
by
a
dash
of
spring
meadow
dandelions
and
grass
different
but
not
quite
as
funky
as
id
expected
definitely
not
bad
but
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
2004
edition
wow
these
are
interesting
beers
pours
a
vibrant
light
orange
color
zero
head
and
apparently
zero
carbonation
but
even
before
i
poured
it
as
i
let
it
warm
up
a
tad
from
being
in
the
fridge
i
could
smell
it
from
the
bottle
a
few
feet
away
once
its
in
my
awesome
schlitz
snifter
the
fragrance
is
even
more
pronounced
major
funk
dirt
spices
lemmon
rind
burns
the
ol
nose
hairs
if
you
take
a
huge
sniff
first
sip
the
taste
is
much
more
subtle
than
i
was
expecting
much
less
intense
or
sour
than
their
gueuze
which
at
first
threw
me
off
however
i
think
since
your
tastebuds
arent
attacked
theres
more
room
for
unique
flavors
to
present
themselves
wow
theres
a
lot
more
here
than
i
originally
thought
theres
a
real
wet
hay
taste
to
it
mixed
with
freshly
cut
grass
also
lemon
juice
and
citrus
along
with
some
spice
maybe
even
a
hop
or
two
thrown
in
there
im
also
getting
some
distinct
saltwater
action
like
taking
a
gulp
of
the
ocean
everything
hits
you
again
in
the
aftertaste
which
lingers
incredibly
light
and
smooth
mouthfeel
a
really
interesting
beer
one
you
could
taste
again
and
again
and
find
new
and
challenging
things
this
was
my
first
sample
of
a
cantillon
and
i
could
see
where
a
couple
of
these
would
make
you
want
to
get
up
and
boogie
must
try
more
by
these
folks
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
different
from
any
other
lambic
ive
had
it
still
has
the
lambic
qualities
but
without
the
fruit
focus
according
to
the
back
this
is
the
onlytru
unblended
lambic
you
can
find
really
well
at
least
its
a
good
one
had
this
on
tap
last
evening
the
brew
was
poured
to
a
cloudy
brass
color
with
no
head
what
so
ever
the
smell
was
tart
as
my
wife
said
it
reminded
her
of
sour
patch
candy
also
notices
earthy
like
aroma
the
taste
was
quite
sour
and
also
had
wine
like
highlights
as
the
brew
warms
the
tartness
comes
out
more
and
more
also
notice
what
i
believe
is
a
oak
like
taste
that
seems
to
complement
it
quite
nicely
over
all
it
was
a
good
brew
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
would
try
it
again
but
not
regularly
poured
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
i
was
a
little
worried
because
the
side
of
the
bottle
was
sticky
and
the
cork
crumbled
when
i
open
it
but
everything
turned
out
fine
this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
orange
with
a
great
deal
of
floaties
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
sour
typical
lambic
not
quite
as
funky
as
some
but
the
funk
is
still
there
sour
grapes
and
lemon
acid
burns
the
throat
this
unblended
lambic
is
not
as
complex
as
some
gueuzes
no
carbonation
but
its
still
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
mouth
puckering
a
little
thin
but
very
flavorful
not
the
best
from
cantillon
but
a
very
good
beer
a
wonderful
treat
very
complex
and
satisfying
drinkability
ill
pass
on
this
one
it
was
the
cheapest
of
the
cantillon
line
when
i
bought
it
6
months
ago
at
about
12
hopefully
my
next
try
will
be
better
not
even
giving
up
on
them
yet
cloudy
golden
yellow
very
hazy
no
head
sweet
honey
nose
with
strong
brett
profile
kiwi
lemon
grapefruit
and
mostly
pineapple
make
for
a
dynamic
fruit
salad
horsey
funk
salt
ink
lactic
and
big
rubber
tones
make
up
for
funk
lovers
i
couldnt
dig
the
flavor
so
much
plastic
and
rubber
are
a
bit
too
dominant
im
not
one
to
complain
about
crap
leather
and
the
likes
but
i
find
no
interest
in
plastic
astringent
and
citric
grapefruitpineapple
juice
still
body
juicy
and
funky
i
expected
more
from
my
first
unblended
lambic
experience
out
of
a
capped
and
corked
750ml
split
with
a
friend
it
pours
out
very
mildly
carbonated
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
a
few
bubbles
cling
to
the
insides
of
the
glass
at
most
the
body
is
thick
with
haze
and
is
an
orangish
shade
of
amber
the
nose
is
alive
with
damp
hay
musty
oak
and
sour
funky
aromas
sipping
this
brew
is
almost
a
shock
at
first
and
even
when
youre
used
to
it
will
still
come
back
and
slap
your
tongue
around
a
little
bit
initially
a
bit
astringent
midpalate
the
funky
flavors
of
damp
earth
and
hay
appear
alongside
musty
oak
and
then
intertwine
and
are
eventually
eclipsed
by
facecaving
tartness
that
lasts
through
the
finish
where
it
is
met
a
with
the
flavors
of
grapeskin
i
cant
even
really
describe
everything
that
goes
on
in
this
beer
but
it
is
a
wonderfully
complex
experience
upon
it
disembarking
the
750ml
green
bottle
resides
in
the
glass
a
beclouded
straw
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
and
the
resultant
lace
a
thin
but
sealing
sheet
nose
is
tart
with
hints
of
sour
apples
citrus
like
in
its
crispness
start
is
dry
and
sour
with
the
top
light
finish
continues
the
devastatingly
tartness
dry
as
a
bleached
desert
bone
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
long
a
true
lambic
lovers
brew
that
you
will
love
or
hate
i
love
it
but
beware
its
not
meant
for
everyone
even
if
you
like
most
lambics
cheers
what
a
complex
yet
well
balanced
beer
i
really
like
it
but
i
think
i
like
the
gueuze
better
cheers
to
cantillon
for
keeping
the
tradition
alive
and
well
fyi
vintage
2003
i
guess
i
couldnt
wait
any
longer
pours
out
a
strawish
color
with
little
to
no
head
tastes
big
and
sour
just
as
one
would
expect
a
true
lambic
cantillon
keeps
putting
out
some
of
the
best
lambic
in
the
world
and
this
grand
cru
broucsella
is
no
exception
but
you
either
like
the
beast
or
you
dont
if
you
do
like
the
sourpuss
lambic
you
wont
lose
with
this
one
this
lambic
is
everything
and
more
of
what
it
is
trying
to
be
the
gods
blessed
this
barrel
well
phenomenal
initially
sharply
acidic
held
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
its
just
like
lemon
juice
that
you
buy
in
a
bottle
slightly
sweet
when
held
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
earthy
mushroom
forming
somewhere
deeply
hidden
jawclenching
sourness
when
rolled
to
the
sides
with
explosive
crab
apple
and
drawing
tannins
very
very
dry
in
the
finish
with
acidic
lingerings
long
long
after
the
swallow
this
lambic
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
thin
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
a
tart
musty
gueuzelike
aroma
the
taste
was
sharp
and
tart
with
some
musty
and
vinous
qualities
some
tanins
could
be
tasted
in
the
astringent
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
tart
and
dry
the
body
was
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
had
a
sublime
quality
and
the
dryness
and
flavor
lingered
nicely
this
was
a
very
nice
lambic
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
pour
was
a
cloudy
apricot
color
aroma
was
of
sweet
sweatsocks
i
found
the
taste
sweet
to
start
but
sort
of
hit
a
tannic
or
leathery
wall
intriguing
the
beer
became
a
bit
more
tart
as
it
warmed
up
with
horseblanket
notes
coming
on
strong
towards
the
end
a
beer
i
need
to
do
more
research
on
definitley
not
for
the
faint
of
beer
palate
a
relentless
masterpiece
this
bruocsella
1900
grand
cru
a
bold
yet
benevolent
fellow
my
mouth
wont
know
quite
what
to
do
with
itself
when
the
bottle
is
gone
big
thanks
bighuge
i
think
i
could
drink
this
from
time
to
time
id
like
to
explore
the
rest
of
the
cantillon
line
being
an
obsessive
cantillon
fan
i
couldnt
pass
this
brew
up
when
i
first
came
across
it
it
comes
in
a
capped
and
corked
750ml
bottle
with
a
note
from
the
brewer
on
the
back
stating
that
this
is
the
only
unblended
lambic
available
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
no
head
this
beer
is
as
close
to
uncarbonated
as
possible
the
nose
is
full
of
oakey
earthy
notes
with
just
a
hint
of
the
sourness
to
come
taste
is
as
sour
as
can
be
with
some
barnyard
notes
and
a
firm
oak
backing
the
body
is
light
and
the
acidity
makes
the
beer
jump
off
the
palette
and
leaves
you
ready
for
more
an
amazing
unique
brew
although
i
must
admit
the
traditional
blended
geueze
is
a
little
more
my
style
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
no
head
smell
is
of
oak
musty
barnyards
sour
vinegar
and
an
almost
clean
scent
that
i
cant
quite
place
the
taste
is
fantastic
massive
depth
the
oakiness
smooths
the
entire
range
of
flavors
and
unites
them
into
one
unified
tongue
demolishing
front
lactic
and
acetic
notes
predominate
and
the
finish
smoothes
over
with
a
rich
tannin
quality
like
a
dry
white
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
but
i
think
im
just
not
used
to
beers
with
purposefully
no
carbonation
it
is
a
cascading
array
of
flavors
and
tastes
truly
an
exceptional
beer
after
describing
the
unadulterated
lambic
i
enjoyed
the
rest
of
it
with
stinky
mushroomyearthy
french
cheese
smeared
on
slices
of
french
baguette
excellent
underneath
nary
a
head
bubbly
and
white
sits
an
inviting
golden
liquid
of
pure
unblended
real
lambic
aroma
is
of
wool
acetic
acid
lemon
and
hay
must
lime
dew
and
a
slight
funky
barnyard
character
as
well
the
carbonation
is
very
low
almost
negligible
the
flavors
of
this
tart
beer
are
surprisingly
refreshing
the
acidic
nature
offers
a
bit
of
a
bite
but
the
flavors
blend
together
nicely
lemongrass
vinegar
funky
barnyard
stuff
aged
hops
army
blanket
and
bone
dry
and
thats
an
understatement
yeah
this
is
lambic
and
a
good
one
at
that
refreshing
in
an
unparalleled
fashion
this
is
the
only
unblended
straight
lambic
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
in
bottled
form
truly
remarkable
grand
cru
actually
paired
quite
well
with
baked
escolar
in
a

marinade
the
acidity
of
the
lambic
balanced
out
the
oiliness
of
the
fish
and
the
sweetness
and
tanginess
of
the
marinade
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
aged
for
almost
two
years
in
the
bottle
it
could
go
much
longer
and
for
some
folks
tastes
probably
should
this
will
no
doubt
frighten
the
unenlightened
bottled
2003
after
being
aged
in
an
oak
barrel
for
three
years
appearance
after
a
vigorous
pour
forms
with
thin
large
bubles
and
quickly
fades
away
leaves
behind
an
apple
juice
looking
nectar
aroma
so
much
exubrance
of
crazy
aromas
that
probably
shouldnt
be
in
a
beer
however
this
is
a
lambic
tones
of
barnyard
funk
acidic
leathery
qualities
woody
finish
fromt
the
oak
barrel
aging
is
evident
extreme
in
my
book
for
being
so
different
and
traditional
to
this
ancient
craft
taste
more
stand
offish
when
it
comes
to
sourness
yes
it
is
extremely
sour
but
more
mellow
than
other
cantillon
products
i
sampled
aggressive
tartness
blended
with
an
oak
flavor
and
tons
of
wild
flavors
barnyard
in
nature
is
how
most
describe
this
stuff
mouthfeel
medium
body
coats
the
palate
with
a
dry
finish
completely
unique
and
hard
to
describe
drinkability
wow
not
me
i
cant
sit
here
and
sip
on
it
like
a
lemonade
challenges
my
palate
with
many
alien
tones
but
i
see
why
this
artform
is
so
highly
regarded
i
have
a
great
respect
for
it
this
is
a
great
and
one
of
the
few
examples
of
a
traditional
lambic
this
beer
is
one
of
the
few
chances
for
most
to
sample
an
unblended
lambic
and
for
this
alone
cantillon
is
to
be
applauded
i
do
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
a
bit
of
warning
though
these
flat
bottles
of
lambic
need
to
be
served
warmer
than
usual
about
60f
15c
as
i
find
uncarbonated
lambic
needs
to
be
a
bit
warmer
than
usual
in
order
to
fully
express
its

this
is
a
dark
golden
colour
with
a
huge
head
of
fluffy
white
bubbles
the
aromas
are
of
atypical
gueuzelike
tartness
and
funky
stuff
but
this
brew
is
much
more
subdued
than
the
afforementioned
gueuze
the
taste
is
quite
tart
and
funky
with
some
lovely
sweet
and
sour
notes
and
the
undeniably
amazing
complexity
of
all
of
this
breweries
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
astringent
and
not
as
carbonated
as
their
gueuze
and
the
drinkability
is
amazing
world
class
stuff
i
selected
this
beer
as
a
celebration
of
the
end
of
the
semester
as
well
as
a
toast
for
good
luck
for
tomorrows
gre
i
can
see
why
someone
said
this
is
a
love
or
hate
beer
though
one
glass
is
a
fantastic
and
complex
experience
this
would
take
quite
a
robust
soul
to
session
with
still
a
nice
celebration
beer
and
certainly
one
id
save
for
other
rare
occasions
in
the
future
drinkability

you
will
love
or
hate
this
bottle
either
way
it
is
very
complex
the
depths
of
the
flavors
are
beyond
reproach
this
particular
bottle
poured
completely
flat
not
a
bubble
to
be
seen
ahh
well
you
take
your
chances
with
these
lambics
i
suppose
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
slightly
tart
aroma
that
strikes
one
first
as
mostly
tart
but
then
develops
a
tropical
fruit
like
sweetness
the
flavor
too
is
tart
and
fruity
with
a
sweet
midpalateness
and
a
reassertive
tartness
to
the
finish
pretty
good
asis
but
id
love
to
see
a
better
sample
the
bottle
reviewed
was
bottled
in
1999
the
head
is
not
particularly
attractive
for
this
kind
of
beer
with
an
orange
colour
the
smell
is
horse
sweat
aged
leather
its
a
flat
lambic
quite
quiet
with
maybe
a
little
lack
of
aggressiveness
and
naughtiness
it
is
advisable
as
an
introduction
to
lambic
extremely
fizzy
from
the
start
leaving
a
dense
head
of
fine
bubbles
reddish
gold
in
color
horsey
tangy
and
slight
metallicy
twang
hit
the
nose
sweetness
greats
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
eventually
gives
was
to
a
tangy
almost
metallic
finish
more
balanced
towards
the
sweet
side
for
a
lambic
but
not
too
sweet
for
the
style
not
as
dry
as
other
examples
of
the
style
body
is
dull
mediumlight
amber
the
head
forms
easily
and
fades
easily
the
aroma
is
mulch
or
the
loam
in
a
forest
hint
of
horse
blanket
and
ripe
citrus
or
peach
the
flavor
basalmic
vinegar
and
cotton
candy
minus
the
sweetness
salt
and
really
thin
sour
kumquats
or
oranges
that
arent
quite
ripe
yet
a
little
orange
peel
as
well
a
bit
bitter
in
the
finish
is
tart
but
not
as
harshly
tart
as
the
hanssens
oude
gueuze
i
had
a
few
days
ago
i
didnt
care
for
it
to
start
with
but
the
more
you
drink
the
easier
it
gets
pretty
wierd
stuff
no
head
whatsoever
murky
light
brown
to
slight
orange
appearance
very
balsamic
tart
nose
it
attacks
your
tongue
with
brutal
sourness
amazingly
mouth
puckering
veeeery
sour
quite
earthy
in
aroma
and
taste
and
extremely
dry
which
i
like
this
was
one
of
those
beers
that
you
dont
know
if
you
truly
love
or
hate
and
thats
how
it
got
me
pours
an
energetic
ruby
tinged
amber
with
incredible
very
fine
carbonation
the
head
rises
to
about
one
to
one
and
a
half
fingers
and
then
quickly
recedes
it
is
very
unusual
to
find
such
fine
champagnelike
carbonation
with
the
light
beer
body
to
hold
the
bubbles
together
and
produce
such
a
fine
mouthfeel
the
aromas
include
some
fruit
and
citrus
maybe
grapefruit
punctuated
by
a
little
barnyard
there
are
so
many
tastes
they
are
so
well
blended
and
balanced
and
they
create
such
a
flow
of
flavor
in
your
mouth
that
it
is
hard
to
identify
them
all
there
is
a
little
fruit
malt
and
a
couple
of
different
hop
aspects
you
can
taste
both
the
old
lambic
hops
dull
stale
with
a
lot
of
tannins
with
the
fresher
hop
character
spicy
and
bitterer
the
beer
also
has
a
winelike
quality
to
it
as
well
as
the
kind
of
oak
you
would
get
with
an
oaky
chardonnay
the
tartness
balances
well
with
the
different
varieties
of
the
hop
the
tannins
from
the
old
hops
and
the
bitterness
and
spiciness
from
the
newer
hops
the
lemonygrapefruity
tartness
and
the
barnyard
funkiness
all
blend
together
in
a
very
amazing
way
tart
lightly
acidic
funky
and
earthy
4

lots
of
funk
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
enjoyed
it
intense
sourness
from
the
very
beginning
but
more
complex
than
the
usual
lambic
with
the
help
of
a
well
developed
malt
foundation
creates
a
vivid
tart
mouthfeel
driven
by
a
dough
leathery
funkiness
the
taste
inherits
both
green
apples
and
musty
white
grapes
among
a
gentle
amount
of
white
citrus
peel
accompanied
by
their
earthier
stonepits
malts
turn
even
more
intense
during
the
finish
calming
the
brews
lactic
acidity
while
creating
a
very
interessting
counterpart
to
citrus
peel
and
mild
hops

an
really
nice
beer
from
cantillon
that
stands
out
from
their
other
beers
for
the
higher
presence
of
hop
characteristics
given
that
its
unblended
i
can
only
imagine
that
the
beer
itself
changes
somewhat
from
year
to
year
with
the
fermentation
being
spontaneous
i
would
be
curious
to
sample
other
vintages
to
see
how
different
it
actually
gets
sweet
and
sour
tart
right
up
front
a
sense
of
sour
funked
out
candied
peaches
and
apricots
that
were
left
out
in
a
damp
basement
for
a
few
weeks
tiny
hint
of
some
raspberries
almost
like
a
pollen
filled
spring
day
in
a
meadow
fizzy
carbonation
just
right
leaves
a
perfect
dryness
to
the
finish
almost
champagnelike
mild
hop
bitterness
as
compared
to
american
beers
dance
well
with
the
aforementioned
flavors
a
star
my
first
cantillon
enjoying
in
le
maraise
in
paris
will
go
back
and
get
more
methinks
my
favorite
beer
period
totally
different
stuff
from
cantillon
here
all
barley
malt
instead
of
some
amount
of
wheat
in
here
make
it
quite
a
bit
more
sturdy
then
their
lambic
types
and
the
hops
are
definitely
more
aggressive
in
flavor
although
still
really
mild
especially
by
american
standards
the
beer
has
a
darker
caramel
color
to
it
plenty
of
hazy
as
per
usual
with
cantillon
and
a
tall
and
lasting
dull
muted
whited
head
of
tiny
bubbles
the
nose
is
more
funk
than
sour
with
some
textured
sweetness
in
there
and
then
of
course
the
oaky
mature
lacto
thing
to
finish
the
taste
is
just
like
the
nose
exactly
like
it
with
the
barley
malt
influencing
this
beer
more
in
terms
of
body
i
think
than
flavor
the
hops
have
an
earthy
dried
herbal
character
to
them
than
likes
the
bigger
body
and
carbonation
is
effervescently
bright
i
like
the
slightly
richer
feel
to
this
and
the
longer
finish
not
usually
there
in
their
lambic
maybe
a
little
less
unique
and
distinct
than
some
of
their
other
beers
like
say
fou
foune
or
the
lou
pepe
fruit
beers
but
i
think
its
quality
is
as
good
as
any
and
its
definitely
a
new
direction
for
them
stoked
to
have
shared
this
bottle
with
my
brother
who
loves
sours
and
wilds
but
until
now
has
never
had
a
beer
from
cantillon
we
both
really
enjoyed
it
overall
underwhelming
for
me
my
least
favorite
cantillon
to
date
although
its
still
pretty
tasty
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
has
a
tart
green
apple
and
lemon
aftertaste
a
very
nice
lambic
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
good
sour
with
a
nice
floral
presence
that
is
well
as
balanced
with
the
tartness
o
this
is
the
driest
of
all
the
cantillons
i
have
tried
which
is
not
that
many
this
was
a
real
treat
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
enjoy
over
a
long
period
of
time
overall
a
nice
lambic
slightly
maltier
than
the
norm
with
a
noble
hop
bitterness
throughout
delicious
now
but
only
gets
better
with
age
75
cl
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
murky
ruddy
orangeamber
hue
with
almost
no
head
once
everything
settles
out
just
a
speckling
of
white
bubbles
floating
there
there
is
a
neat
effect
where
a
sip
leaves
some
lacing
composed
of
tiny
bubbles
that
evaporate
almost
instantly
sublime
aroma
decidedly
funky
and
sour
with
assertive
lime
lemon
horse
blanket
aspirin
flower
shop
root
cellar
and
white
wine
all
vying
for
ones
attention
but
with
nothing
sticking
out
in
an
unpleasant
fashion
palate
is
similarly
complex
yet
dominated
by
dry
and
sour
hop
and
wild
yeast
elements
with
pretty
minimal
sweetness
aside
from
a
faint
tinge
of
caramel
discernible
in
the
finish
if
you
concentrate
i
get
apple
cider
vinegar
lemon
and
lime
peelrind
baby
aspirin
champagne
tannic
grape
skins
horse
blanket
or
dry
canvas
sheet
seems
like
an
apt
descriptor
sorry
and
a
general
forest
floor
earthiness
from
start
to
finish
supremely
tasty
sour
and
more
pungent
than
some
other
common
examples
ive
tried
from
petrus
and
rodenbach
no
sugar
in
this
sucker
the
label
is
careful
to
state
that
this
is
not
a
lambic
which
is
interesting
probably
on
the
basis
of
the
lack
of
wheat
and
hopping
regime
very
low
carbonation
but
not
flat
airy
light
body
and
a
massively
sour
finish
that
manages
to
hit
woody
hard
candy
and
hay
elements
before
descending
into
a
supertannic
green
apple
and
white
wine
vinegar
finale
what
a
beer
for
some
reason
my
ratings
seem
high
but
shall
stand
i
agree
with
jeff
sparrow
in
wild
brews

this
was
a
nice
beer
to

carbonated

due

it

made
only
with

and

a
pearlescent
orange
color
that
is
pseudolambic
went
to
the
brewery
for
the
tour
really
enjoyed
the
tour
and
would
recommend
however
i
am
glad
they
only
give
you
a
small
glass
of
the
lambic
itself
at
the
end
the
taste
gives
me
nightmares
the
flavor
is
good
with
a
raw
yet
not
extreme
sour
flavor
of
lambic
with
mild
funk
still
refined
in
its
unblended
young
form
fresh
with
lemony
and
woody
elements
yet
the
nice
tropical
tangy
juicy
flavor
is
not
as
intense
with
light
acidity
overall
very
good
and
was
interesting
to
try
side
by
side
with
a
more
finished
tasting
fresh
bottle
of
gueuze
which
lets
you
understand
the
progression
of
the
flavor
and
feel
better
o
drank
at
cantillon
brewery
awesome
experience
this
one
came
with
the
brewery
tour
o
4
onice
treat
to
be
able
to
try
it
at
the
brewery
good
but
not
the
best
of
their
offerings
by
any
means
unblended
lambics
have
no
smooth
edges
they
can
typically
be
summed
up
in
three
words
funk
funk
and
funk
both
literally
and
figuratively
they
lack
the
pop
of
gueuzes
and
instead
really
narrow
in
on
those
aspects
of
the
style
that
most
resemble
as
martyn
cornell
has
put
it
a
rugby
team
changingroom
after
a
tough
match
on
a
hot
day
sound
appealing
strangely
it
is
overall
interesting
it
seems
to
basically
be
bruocsella
grand
cru
but
more
raw
and
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
serving
type
bottle
o
i
feel
like
this
is
exactly
what
an
unblended
two
year
old
lambic
should
taste
sure
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
thats
why
its
perfect
for
blending
and
fruit
additions
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
one
day
hopefully
a
little
closer
to
the
source
nice
to
try
the
regular
unblended
lambic
o
this
was
a
really
nice
2
year
lambic
on
tap
clean
crisp
flavors
some
layers
of
funk
and
acid
i
really
liked
this
since
the
brett
didnt
get
too
funky
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
a
kiss
of
alcohol
keeps
things
interesting
this
was
tart
but
not
puckeringly
so
i
found
myself
crushing
my
glass
quicker
than
i
wanted
to
was
left
wanting
to
drink
more
i
dont
know
how
often
a
treat
like
this
comes
around
but
if
you
get
a
chance
you
need
to
try
this
overall
this
was
an
interesting
experience
to
taste
a
lambic
so
fresh
and
unblended
it
is
really
oaky
but
not
overly
so
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
the
drinkability
it
is
still
quite
tasty
just
kind
of
one
dimentional
considering
the
unblended
nature
and
the
youth
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
but
i
dont
need
to
as
with
other
cantillon
offerings
overall
this
beer
is
great
but
i
do
prefer
1900
grand
cru
overall
its
a
solid
lambic
even
if
it
doesnt
look
like
something
i
would
want
to
drink
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
never
had
an
unblended
lambic
until
now
the
official
name
on
the
board
was
single
barrel
lambic
2
unblended
so
im
hoping
this
is
the
right
place
for
this
review
vinegar
must
earth
wet
wood
funk
and
barn
come
through
in
the
nose
and
the
flavor
it
sounds
strange
but
you
can
really
get
the
barrel
and
unblended
qualities
from
this
not
as
effervescent
as
blended
versions
started
the
day
with
this
and
was
very
happy
with
that
choice
great
stuff
o
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
not
only
was
it
very
interesting
but
it
was
very
good
it
was
awesome
being
able
to
try
this
alongside
other
cantillons
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
as
flavorful
as
other
cantillons
but
it
definitely
had
the
unique
cantillon
funk
that
the
microorganisms
in
the
brewery
creat
for
an
unblended
lambic
this
was
fantastic
and
practically
just
as
enjoyable
as
any
blended
lambic
overall
this
was
an
awesome
experience
and
i
would
recommend
any
one
to
try
it
as
well
if
they
get
the
chance
o
a
very
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
from
cantillon
but
its
still
a
great
beer
and
cool
to
compare
to
bruocsella
the
beer
is
transparent
and
copper
to
amber
in
color
no
head
whatsoever
the
aroma
brings
basement
rain
water
funk
the
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
anticipated
a
bit
of
cantillon
funk
in
the
finish
but
not
to
the
usual
level
notes
of
ripe
fruit
overall
this
was
just
ok
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
from
the
source
and
comparing
to
this
vintage
bottle
version
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
easydrinking
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
lambics
but
this
one
is
very
impressive
for
a
work
in
progress
that
is
meant
for
blending
and
not
intended
to
be
sold
on
its
own
a
decent
beer
with
nice
complexity
and
an
incredible
mouthfeel
i
can
see
where
the
cantillon
magic
stems
from
definitely
worth
seeking
out
on
tap
beer
is
medium
in
body
a
little
cidery
on
the
nose
the
finish
is
nice
with
a
little
tartness
coming
through
a
shadow
of
funk
is
in
there
as
well
i
really
am
looking
forward
to
one
day
trying
this
beer
at
the
source
overall
the
smell
was
nice
but
not
strong
enough
i
enjoyed
the
balance
and
the
fact
that
this
one
didnt
try
to
kill
you
with
tartness
i
would
have
it
again
given
the
chance
cheers
had
on
tap
at
moeder
lambic
pour
is
a
peachy
yellow
mostly
transparent
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
nose
has
a
touch
of
lemon
with
a
nice
dusty
funk
to
it
cob
webbs
and
light
leather
more
lemon
with
some
golden
fruits
faintly
weaved
in
at
the
end
the
taste
is
extremely
dusty
and
funky
very
old
bookshelf
there
is
some
tart
lemon
that
comes
in
as
peaches
golden
fruits
and
some
floral
bitter
hops
present
themselves
behind
in
order
the
body
is
light
very
gentle
soft
carbonation
and
rather
dry
in
the
finish
funky
is
the
focus
age
may
add
some
fruit
as
this
is
probably
a
newer
oude
lambic
o
pretty
good
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
cantillon
the
nose
is
good
but
i
dont
think
the
taste
lived
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
theres
less
complexity
but
it
is
damn
easy
to
drink
obviously
youre
going
to
try
it
no
matter
what
i
say
its
cantillon
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
infinitely
drinkable
this
is
the
foundation
of
many
cantillon
beers
this
was
our
first
beer
after
getting
off
the
plane
and
it
did
not
disappoint
great
way
to
start
the
trip
overall
a
good
beer
great
if
you
like
tart
flavors
great
if
you
like
bitter
flavors
not
so
great
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
hops
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
a
really
good
experience
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
when
you
get
the
chance
and
the
temptation
is
surely
great
enough
that
every
beer
geek
will
get
the
chance
at
some
point
o
this
is
an
experience
i
will
likely
have
only
once
but
certainly
i
will
recall
it
so
frequently
my
wife
will
be
tired
of
hearing
this
story
over
and
over
one
of
my
best
experiences
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
try
this
and
at
2
euro
its
a
bargain
in
my
book
od
im
so
jealous
that
people
in
brussels
can
session
this
so
easily
quite
a
nice
little
sour
beer
lots
of
flavour
and
an
abv
considered
low
these
days
its
worth
marvelling
at
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
thought
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
to
sample
since
it
is
or
will
become
one
of
the
components
of
gueuze
since
it
has
already
passed
its
first
birthday
but
not
by
much
it
clearly
has
some
maturation
in
its
future
before
being
blended
with
the
other
lambics
that
will
one
day
join
it
to
make
up
a
gueuze
im
guessing
that
this
one
has
to
be
let
age
a
lot
longer
so
that
more
of
the
mustiness
and
sourness
can
develop
my
overall
impression
as
im
learning
more
about
lambics
and
gueuzes
is
that
this
was
a
great
opportunity
to
taste
one
of
the
beers
that
the
blender
works
with
while
it
was
not
an
exceptional
beer
the
experience
was
unique
and
worth
seeking
out
if
possible
if
you
see
this
jump
at
the
chance
same
with
raw
lambic
from
any
of
the
majors
what
a
special
experience
to
have
this
at
the
cantillon
brewery
not
exactly
my
favorite
thing
i
like
the
blends
better
but
very
cool
to
have
after
seeing
exactly
how
its
produced
my
first
unblended
lambic
so
not
sure
what
this
is
supposed
to
taste
like
not
unpleasant
i
finished
a
half
pint
without
struggling
amberhoney
in
color
slightly
hazy
with
no
head
lemon
rubber
aspirin
and
vinegar
mingle
with
honey
and
shortbread
for
a
thoroughly
strange
and
mishmashed
aroma
even
for
a
lambic
the
flavor
is
oddly
salty
sour
but
not
powerfully
so
full
of
green
apple
orange
juice
and
pickled
plum
with
a
finish
of
toasted
grain
and
a
dollop
of
butter
generally
speaking
it
is
reminiscent
of
seawater
savory
salty
tangy
and
a
perfect
match
for
seafood
or
japanese
food
i
suspect
the
cask
carbonation
is
all
wrong
though
this
needs
to
be
fizzier
and
more
lively
and
colder
not
a
brilliant
beer
in
my
mind
this
is
more
gose
than
gueuze
but
drinkable
and
potentially
a
very
good
food
beer
this
is
painfully
easy
to
drink
and
insanely
delicious
very
refreshing
through
out
and
no
overly
anything
drinkability
good
very
interesting
to
try
but
ultimately
i
prefer
cantillons
lambic
older
bruoscella
grand
cru
or
blended
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
relatively
mild
beer
after
having
my
palate
conditioned
by
a
taste
of
the
rose
de
gambrinus
it
was
funky
but
not
in
nearly
as
aggressive
a
manner
as
say
df
hommage
nor
was
it
sharply
dry
overall
it
was
very
pleasant
to
drink
highly
recommended
if
you
happen
to
be
in
brussels
d
my
enjoyment
tapered
off
a
little
as
i
drank
more
but
that
is
of
course
relative
to
the
impeccable
initial
taste
regular
availability
would
be
sweet
on
tap
at
monks
in
the
back
bar
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
no
carbonation
into
a
tall
flute
glass
the
aroma
gives
you
citrus
and
a
bit
of
farmy
funk
that
you
would
expect
from
cantillon
beers
the
taste
is
a
very
citrusy
barnyard
mix
that
is
enjoyable
to
the
mouth
and
tastebuds
this
is
enjoyable
for
a
sour
beer
as
i
found
myself
looking
for
another
and
another
as
it
is
drinkable
the
body
was
light
but
it
has
more
mouthfeel
than
expected
it
tastes
of
fresh
lemon
peal
honey
and
of
course
barnyard
it
finishes
very
clean
for
a
sour
beer
and
it
leaves
you
with
just
enough
to
always
want
more
i
dont
feel
it
is
as
agressive
as
other
cantillon
beers
but
it
is
still
fantastic
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
any
time
but
i
think
it
goes
especially
well
at
the
begining
of
a
meal
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
golden
peach
color
with
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
head
only
the
slightest
trace
of
carbonation
can
be
found
and
only
that
when
the
beer
is
drank
smells
of
tart
apple
wheat
and
tangy
pear
greet
the
nose
i
realize
this
is
straight
lambic
with
no
fruit
added
but
a
non
descript
frutiness
comes
about
from
the
funky
brett
the
taste
is
quite
clean
on
the
pallete
and
starts
with
a
muted
sweetness
and
grassy
flavor
which
quickly
spins
on
its
head
to
a
citric
acidity
and
back
again
amazingly
sour
and
amazingly
refreshing
i
could
have
drank
this
all
night
and
any
ulcers
would
be
worth
the
risk
the
body
is
light
and
the
beer
drinks
incredibly
easy
seeing
as
this
is
nearly
3
years
old
i
tend
to
think
some
of
the
sharp
funkiness
and
biting
acidity
has
been
smoothed
out
although
this
probably
wont
be
embraced
by
drinkers
new
to
the
style
the
straight
lambic
cantillon
puts
out
is
fantastic
and
is
worth
getting
whenever
it
can
be
found
many
thanks
to
monks
for
bringing
this
treat
to
philly
this
is
a
rating
for
the
1
year
old
lambic
this
was
served
from
the
cask
at
the
brewery
this
oneyearold
was
quite
mellow
the
characteristic
cantillon
acidity
had
yet
to
come
into
full
force
served
completely
flat
the
beer
released
a
musty
sour
aroma
to
my
nose
the
taste
though
not
overly
acidic
tasted
of
citrus
tasted
slightly
herbal
as
well
with
a
faint
woodiness
to
it
definitely
interesting
to
taste
along
with
the
other
more
aged
products
still
has
a
ways
to
go
in
the
complexity
department
love
it
or
hate
it
this
is
a
true
experience
everytime
nonbeer
geek
friend
quoth
a
delightfully
perky
little
number
so
its
that
too
boon
isnt
as
celebrated
a
name
as
say
cantillon
but
their
unblended
lambic
is
every
bit
as
good
and
for
my
money
even
better
though
extremely
rare
this
style
is
so
unique
as
to
be
incomparable
to
anything
else
scarcity
is
its
least
important
aspect
still
im
jealous
even
of
myself
for
having
gotten
the
chance
to
try
it
dont
ever
pass
this
one
up
an
old
lambic
that
is
unblended
overall
a
good
example
of
an
old
lambic
that
is
fairly
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
medium
bodied
with
a
vinegary
acetic
flavor
up
front
with
lingering
acidity
but
it
never
becomes
too
harsh
subtle
malt
backbone
provides
some
balance
but
the
tart
puckerifly
flavor
dominates
as
the
aroma
suggests
its
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
could
use
some
more
complexity
acetone
is
strong
in
the
nose
otherwise
some
light
fruits
pears
apricots
and
an
overall
tart
character
it
tastes
a
little
citrusy
maybe
lemon
with
plenty
of
acidity
puckering
and
sour
but
not
as
flavorful
as
id
like
still
solid
enough
d
very
drinkable
i
like
the
spike
of
tartness
and
the
wheatlike
flavors
that
linger
afterwards
a
nice
beer
from
iron
hill
d
decent
but
not
balanced
enough
drinkability
i
did
not
finish
the
bottle
it
was
not
compelling
as
i
wrote
above
this
has
all
the
elements
but
they
are
not
put
together
yet
like
a
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
dig
the
sourness
in
the
one
not
the
best
lambic
but
works
pretty
damn
good
for
me

blank
tart
not
until
it
warms
almost
fully
is
there
a
hint
of
caramel
and
something
else
other
than
tarty
notes
super
acidic
all
the
way
through
sour
and
agressive
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
overly
carbonated
taste
lingers
a
very
long
time
i
had
about
six
ounces
of
this
and
that
was
plenty
sourness
is
just
overpowering
and
it
seems
like
a
muddled
mess
at
times
too
tart
and
you
do
not
hear
me
say
that
much
would
not
drink
again
probably
still
worth
trying
as
this
beer
warms
unlike
the
wilmington
version
the
sweetness
does
not
become
more
pronounced
in
fact
this
seems
to
even
get
a
bit
more
dry
with
time
this
beer
is
a
much
more
lambic
like
example
than
the
other
version
though
i
could
still
wish
for
a
bit
more
bracing
acidity
both
versions
have
much
more
oak
character
than
is
typical
in
a
lambic
but
it
works
quite
well
here
and
actually
helps
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
to
make
it
just
a
little
bit
less
noticeable
both
versions
have
an
acetic
note
to
them
that
is
more
akin
to
a
flemish
sour
but
it
is
much
more
pronounced
in
the
wilmington
version
i
think
this
also
helps
to
accentuated
the
sweetness
in
that
version
as
well
notes
from
12109
the
beer
is
served
on
the
warm
side
as
this
is
still
very
hot
and
the
cellar
here
has
been
warming
up
the
beer
tastes
nicely
lactic
and
tart
which
engulfs
the
palate
on
the
first
sip
the
beer
finishes
with
an
oxidized
apple
character
as
well
as
some
pear
like
flavors
the
beer
is
light
bodied
but
still
manages
to
have
some
texture
to
it
the
acidity
manages
to
wipe
the
palate
clean
quite
quickly
though
this
is
only
softly
acidic
though
the
lack
of
carbonation
does
tend
to
mute
the
sourness
of
lambics
musty
brettanomyces
flavors
a
touch
of
urea
and
a
musky
sweat
dried
blanket
note
are
quite
apparent
in
the
finish
of
some
sips
there
is
some
astringency
and
bite
in
the
finish
of
this
beer
too
despite
being
a
little
warm
this
is
still
quite
nice
and
refreshing
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
had
a
deep
oud
bruin
look
to
it
a
thin
head
that
quickly
faded
away
smelled
and
tasted
sort
of
like
a
soured
welchs
grape
juice
this
was
alright
the
taste
couldve
been
a
little
better
and
the
aroma
could
have
been
a
lot
better
enjoyed
as
part
of
a
tasting
of
nine
sour
beers
and
hope
to
find
again
while
this
lambic
is
a
whole
lot
more
approachable
than
the
norm
especially
since
its
unblended
by
the
same
token
its
equally
unchallenging
still
good
though
my
enamel
firmly
in
place
for
the
onslaught
to
come
poured
from
a
tabletop
keg
at
dag
van
de
kriek
in
eizeringen
the
appearance
is
cloudy
appleamber
colored
still
with
just
a
bit
of
bubbling
suspended
near
surface
the
smell
is
of
the
cellar
the
apple
barrel
but
not
mildly
flavors
of
apple
banana
a
bit
of
caramel
a
sour
undertone
rather
than
attack
something
minty
herbal
in
there
a
bit
of
bitter
in
the
finish
exceptional
very
good
mouthfeel
of
quaffablly
thin
attack
but
cleansing
acidity
memorable
d

d
a

that
will
one
day
contribute
to
a
nice
gueuze
in
the
meantime
its
an
enjoyable
experience
to
drink
jonge
lambik
a
bit
too
intense
for
multiple
glasses
but
the
one
i
did
have
was
quite
nice
overall
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
and
its
nice
enough
somehow
feel
the
sample
i
had
was
not
in
its
prime
but
still
good
sampled
at
the
oud
beersel
café
this
lambic
is
served
in
the
traditional
manner
completely
flat
no
co2
at
all
from
the
tap
the
lambic
served
here
was
most
likely
a
young
version
the
beer
had
some
reddish
notes
to
it
unlike
the
gueuze
which
was
much
more
of
a
gold
color
the
smell
did
not
smell
as
sour
as
i
had
expected
the
reason
i
think
it
was
young
was
that
the
acidity
seemed
a
bit
low
on
the
other
hand
it
had
a
pronounced
mustiness
to
it
that
was
not
unpleasant
the
beer
was
quite
a
bit
smoother
than
the
gueuze
probably
a
combination
of
no
carbonic
acid
and
an
overall
lower
acidity
level
