o
shockingly
good
beer
might
be
my
favorite
wheatwine
ever
which
isnt
saying
much
but
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
recommended
very
good
beer
in
which
i
am
glad
to
have
sampled
the
flavors
were
interesting
and
well
match
without
overwhelming
this
beer
paired
surprisingly
well
with
the
sweet
potato
fries
with
curry
catsup
d
one
could
sit
at
the
bar
and
drink
two
or
three
of
these
easily
overall
a
very
solid
wheatwine
even
without
the
bourbon
it
has
some
solid
flavors
very
to
to
have
tried
this
one
relatively
drinkable
as
well
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
chewy
fruity
juicy
with
a
sugar
filled
whipped
cream
smack
at
the
end
abv
is
evident
here
8
months
in
one
of
my
favorite
bourbon
barrels
elijah
craig
is
fitting
as
a
sipper
tasted
on
draft
at
goose
island
clybourn
pours
a
clear
amber
with
almost
no
head
aromas
of
caramel
malt
sour
fruit
and
lots
of
oak
the
flavors
are
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
caramel
malts
and
it
is
very
oaky
the
bitter
hops
come
through
on
the
midpalate
and
the
back
of
the
palate
the
body
is
full
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
sweet
and
oaky
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
think
requires
some
more
aging
time
for
the
oak
and
alcohol
to
integrate
light
on
the
palate
alcohol
is
evident
preventing
a
higher
drinkability
score
otherwise
this
is
a
must
have
any
time
its
available
d
i
was
feeling
this
by
the
end
of
the
glass
but
this
was
a
masterfull
wheatwine
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
hige
beer
with
only
a
touch
of
wheat
malt
character
and
a
ton
of
malt
complexity
the
smoothness
of
the
finish
is
probably
the
most
lasting
quality
of
this
brew
very
well
crafted
and
supremely
drinkable
even
for
9
apv
cheers

d
good
tasty
brew
but
not
all
that
drinkable
due
to
the
biting
alcohol
if
they
didnt
make
bourbon
county
stout
too
this
would
easily
be
the
best
goose
island
beer
ive
ever
had
as
it
stands
its
a
tough
call
d
a
definite
sipper
a
nice
example
of
style
fitgers
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
id
recommend
saving
some
for
the
next
day
it
actually
gets
better

just

to

like

a
little
onesided
i
suppose
but
to
my
mind
very
pleasant
like
an
old
favorite
candy
bar
a
nice
entry
in
a
style
that
im
liking
more
and
more
just
a
tad
boozy
still
very
nice
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
2009year
nemesis
wheatwine
overall
sweet
repute
was
an
instant
favorite
of
mine
when
released
as
a
part
of
the
backstage
series
and
theyve
managed
to
improve
upon
it
entirely
o
im
dumbfounded
i
cant
believe
how
good
this
beer
is
founders
god
bless
em
wow
two
years
has
done
this
beer
righteous
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
bit
weird
i
didnt
expect
the
herbal
notes
im
not
sure
of
the
age
of
this
one
but
the
alcohol
notes
werent
as
strong
as
i
would
have
guessed
i
dont
know
that
i
would
have
another
in
the
future
on
draft
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
leaves
behind
an
abundance
of
thin
lacing
the
smell
is
on
the
boozy
side
but
otherwise
remniscent
of
a
hoppy
american
barleywine
has
a
hint
of
honey
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
has
this
sorghum
type
profile
to
it
very
interesting
its
tough
to
make
out
what
else
im
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
albeit
with
a
boozy
finish
overall
pretty
solid
o
a
dipa
mixed
with
a
hefeweizen
mixed
with
a
tripel
cant
go
wrong
in
my
book
my
first
wheatwine
and
i
loved
it
never
had
a
beer
transition
so
much
incredibly
complex
glad
to
have
tried
this

goldenhazy

12
inch
of
tight
foam
on

streaks
of

smell
is
very
sweet
and
honey
is
the
main
contender
wheat
comes
in
second
with
earthy
hops
that
are
light
and
tame
the
taste
is
great
this
is
the
sweetest
wheatwine
ive
had
to
date
and
i
quite
like
it
tastes
include
whatever
i
said
above
but
i
cant
stress
enough
how
well
the
honey
is
used
in
this
its
sweeeet
but
not
cloying
the
feel
is
a
heavy
handed
medium
with
good
carb
livining
up
the
feel
on
this
a
bit
not
at
all
syrupy
although
it
tastes
like
it
should
be
i
wish
i
was
not
driving
or
i
would
have
gotten
more
of
this
one

a

the
caveat
being
that
i
have
relatively
few
comparisons
to
draw
for
it
especially
in
alberta
not
too
sweet
and
complex
enough
with
a
welltempered
elevated
booziness
nice
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
though
i
would
prefer
the
next
time
be
free
of
entry
tickets
the
taste
has
a
flavor
of
dark
wheat
somewhat
grain
influenced
with
mild
toasted
accent
and
subtle
sweetness
from
the
wheat
with
a
mild
yeast
spice
and
a
light
alcohol
influence
as
it
finishes
with
a
subtle
caramel
quality
in
the
residual
taste
overall
this
is
a
very
good
wheatwine
not
intensely
hopped
or
full
of
alcohol
but
a
substantial
and
drinkable
strong
wheat
ale
for
8
flavor
also
had
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
some
suggestions
of
vanilla
had
a
touch
of
some
faint
brown
sugar
and
perhaps
a

cheers
overall
not

as
its
mainstream
cousin
the
american
barleywine
but
very
nice
to
drink
on
a
chilly
november
in
nwnj
great
beer
although
i
dont
catch
to
many
notes
on
the
wheat
side
of
the
beer
the
barleywine
really
stands
out
overall
and
enjoyable
experience
will
get
the
larger
serving
next
time
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
liked
some
aspects
of
it
but
felt
some
of
the
flavor
notes
were
offputting
o
overall
i
was
a
big
fan
of
this
one
the
price
was
great
too
i
plan
to
buy
a
few
more
of
these
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of

wheat
caramel

wood
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
wheat
caramel
and
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
and
wood
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
unique
tartness
in
the
flavor
that
i
am
not
sure
i
have
experienced
in
other
beers
of
the
same
style
o
interesting
wheatwine
the
herbal
hops
and
the
heavy
breadiness
makes
me
think
this
is
like
a
triple
esb
or
something
along
those
lines
lots
of
hearty
wheaty
bread
and
herbal
hops
throughout
honestly
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
bit
simple
but
almost
no
wheatwines
arent

o
really
great
beer
that
kicks
you
on
your
ass
im
really
glad
this
is
being
brewed
in
my
home
town
o
the
booze
is
quite
noticeable
but
this
was
a
ver
great
sipper
with
lots
of
depth
in
flavor
beautiful
color
been
in
the
fridge
a
long
time
no
idea
why
i
bought
it
combo
of
wheat
and
barley
wine
obviously
incompatible
patriot
game
on
might
as
well
do
this
beer
unexpectedly
which
is
always
the
the
best
one
of
the
best
beer
experiences
ive
had

over

thank
you
smuttynose
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
super
smooth
easy
drinking
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
it
is
a
very
big
beer
and
there
is
a
definitely
alcohol
presence
you
need
to
slowly
sip
this
one
o
pretty
heavy
and
complex
sip
over
a
long
period
very
sweet
2013
vintage
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
bright

with
a

that
disappears
rather
quickly
after
the
pour
aromas
of
toasted

tangy

and

flavors
are
very
rich
and
a

caramel
rich
and
roasted
backbone
which
is
overpowered
by
the
sweetness
of
the
palate
some
subtle
spicing
at

end
of
the
palate
helps
clean
everything
up
a
bit
peppery
and
slightly

the

lingering
finish
heavy
brew
with
a
robust
talent
tasty
but
big
o
an
interesting
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
could
drink
often
hazy

quite

overall
an
excellent
beer
i
especially
like
the
moderate
mouth
feel
balanced
with
the
accentuated
finish
looking
forward
to
drinking
again
drink
it
was
flavorful
and
pretty
good
just
wanted
more
i
like
what
smuttynose
does
o
i
like
this
beer
im
not
really
sure
what
a
wheatwine
is
supposed
to
be
but
i
can
certainly
smell
the
wheat
in
the
aroma
and
can
feel
the
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
other
than
that
it
has
a
lot
of
similarities
to
a
barleywine
granted
its
not
on
the
same
level
as
a
lot
of
barleywines
but
then
again
its
not
a
barleywine
i
think
its
a
nice
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
abv
if
i
can
find
them
id
like
to
try
more
wheatwines
othe
wheat
is
too
powerful
and
doesnt
balance
out
nicely
with
he
rest
of
the
brew
overall
definitely
rich
surprised
this
still
has
this
much
alcohol
heat
after
2
years
overall
this
style
is
really
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
luckily
this
was
in
the
hit
column
the
fruitness
from
the
yeast
andor
hops
helps
to
balance
the
sweet
maltiness
i
really
enjoy
these
smuttynose
big
beer
series
offerings
as
they
are
readily
available
to
me
and
quite
reasonabley
priced
with
above
average
quality
o
its
like
a
beer
liqueur
in
a
beer
interesting
to
drink
but
not
something
id
reach
for
again
this
started
out
promising
but
the
herbal
flavors
threw
this
out
if
whack
odwell
worth
a
try
i
havent
been
too
impressed
with
smuttynoses
big
beer
series
this
one
is
pretty
good
but
far
from
awesome
i
didnt
really
like
their
smuttonator
but
their
baltic
porter
is
phenomenal
this
lies
somewhere
in
between
definitely
closer
to
smuttonator
its
a
unique
style
of
beer
but
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
o
3
for
the
2007
4
5
for
the
2012
although
i
cannot
come
to
any
real
conclusions
regarding
the
cellaring
of
this
brew
from
a
single
flawed
data
point
like
this
it
does
pique
my
interest
enough
with
the
detectable
wheat
malt
aspects
over
the
barleywinelike
profile
that
i
will
certainly
now
be
seeking
out
more
wheatwines
to
try
in
the
future
o
very
well
done
very
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
just
with
some
lighter
and
more
wheaty
tones
very
well
rounded
a
pleasure
to
sip
and
two
years
of
aging
has
added
a
little
more
refinement
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
though
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
it
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
unbalanced
and
overcrowded
palate
and
very
boozy
nice
to
see
smuttynose
experimenting
but
this
is
a
style
that
is
rare
for
a
reason
perhaps
the
boozeyist
wheat
wine
ive
tried
so
far
there
is
a
nice
underlying
sweet
complexity
but
its
just
too
overshadowed
by
that
alcohol
bite
still
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
think
its
worth
getting
23
more
to
age
1824
months
will
take
the
edge
off
and
allow
those
other
sweet
wheat
wine
flavors
to
shine
another
very
nice
offering
from
smutty
recommended
thanks
andy
eh
some
alright
flavors
here
but
very
sweet
and
boozy
even
half
a
bomber
is
a
bit
of
a
chore
a
superb
beer
by
its
nature
though
its
probably
more
suited
for
midwinter
consumption
than
midsummer
but
nonetheless
it
was
an
amazing
experience
full
flavored
and
in
your
face
this
beer
pours
an
orangegold
color
with
no
head
or
lace
its
aroma
is
mainly
wheat
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
like
sour
grapes
mixed
with
a
hefeweizen
the
sourness
is
puckeringly

big

series
is
a
disappointing
beer
not
recommended
o
my
first
wheat
wine
what
a
great
style
hopefully
more
like
this
to
come
from
more
breweries
fantastic
beer
the
pretty
orange
coloring
of
the
beer
had
me
interested
although
i
found
the
sweetness
a
bit
overpowering
on
the
nose
there
was
some
citrus
and
hops
behind
but
the
malty
sweetness
also
overpowered
the
palate
some
toasted
notes
on
the
finish
but
lingering
sweetness
made
this
a
difficult
22oz
bottle
to
finish
personal
opinion
is
this
needs
more
hops
to
balance
out
not
sure
if
this
would
age
to
something
special
if
the
sweetness
fades
perhaps
o
i
think
id
like
to
see
more
wheat
character
in
this
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
barley
stands
out
a
little
too
much
and
overpowers
the
wheat
instead
of
being
53
wheat
and
47
barley
it
should
lean
more
towards
something
like
6040
or
a
ratio
where
the
tartness
of
the
wheat
stands
out
more
maybe
it
does
once
it
has
a
little
age
on
it
but
right
now
its
pretty
barleysweet
forward
in
terms
of
taste
other
than
that
though
this
is
a
fairly
solid
beer

overall
this
seemed
to

good
flavors
but
cloyingly
sweet
a
whole
bomber
by
myself
was
too
much
to
handle
nice
take
on
the
style
but
needs
to
be
drunk
in
smaller
doses
o
perhaps
it
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
hard
to
judge
i
guess
because
its
not
a
specific
style
but
thinking
of
it
as
a
wheat
wine
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
i
dont
notice
too
much
of
a
difference
coming
from
the
53
wheat
it
drinks
very
much
like
a
barley
wine
the
flavors
are
very
much
like
a
barley
wine
the
wheat
just
doesnt
add
enough
unique
characteristics
to
the
playing
field
a
good
beer
but
blends
in
with
other
barley
wines
already
out
there
poured

by

and
banana
bread
body
is
medium
large
with
plenty
of
carbonation
for
the
large
abv
a
little
dry
as
expected
from
the
style
and
fairly
drinkable
for
its
large
size
this
is
a
must
try
for
fans
of
barleywines
and
belgians
beers
another
solid
brew
from
smutty
i
have
had
many
over
the
years
but
was
stoked
that
i
never
reviewed
it
o
yeah
the
flavor
profile
is
closer
to
a
barleywine
but
you
cant
put
a
label
on
delicious
damn
near
perfect
in
my
eyes
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
but
smuttynose
definitely
takes
it
a
step
further
wheat
wines
are
an
interesting
concept
the
majority
of
this
beers
malt
bill
is
wheat
it
adds
subtle
spice
and
definitely
softens
out
the
beers
character
overall
my
first
wheat
wine
very
interesting
style
and
i
think
that
smuttynose
did
a
great
job
complex
brew
great
for
a
cool
winters
night
im
sure
a
lot
of
snobs
and
supergeeks
would
bash
this
beer
and
i
can
understand
why
it
seems
to
be
loaded
with
sugar
and
that
was
probably
to
intentionally
spike
the
abv
it
may
be
a
little
too
over
the
top
for
some
but
i
enjoyed
the
shit
out
of
it
would
definitely
buy
again
ive
enjoyed
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
stuff
fresh
in
the
past
and
it
definitely
seems
worthy
of
cellar
consideration
as
well
o
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
but
not
very
drinkable
and
not
very
unique
think
of
a
barleywine
with
muted
hop
character
and
you
pretty
much
have
this
beer
i
can
see
more
wheat
than
i
can
taste
o
while
not
my
favorite
was
not
bad
and
i
could
appeciate
the
way
it
was
made
and
the
complexity
of
flavors
however
it
was
too
boozey
for
me
urg
another
overly
sweet
and
overly
boozy
mess
not
something
i
enjoy
and
not
something
i
would
recommend
i
know
smutty
makes
good
beer
so
im
going
to
get
a
freshie
to
compare
i
am
going
to
review
this
aged
bottle
as
is
though
and
say
that
it
lost
pretty
much
everything
this
is
one
to
drink
fresh
since
the
heat
did
not
die
one
bit
o
i
like
this
beer
i
wish
it
balanced
the
syrupiness
out
a
little
more
but
it
is
very
good
for
what
it
is
i
think
it
would
be
good
to
let
it
sit
on
the
shelf
for
a
few
years
youd
get
more
flavors
out
of
it
and
it
will
definitely
stand
the
test
of
time
i
have
had
a
little
less
than
half
the
bottle
by
now
in
the
review
and
i
am
getting
a
little
tipsy
already
on
second
thought
i
shouldve
split
the
bottle
with
someone
im
going
to
go
take
a
nap
cheers
o
very
sweet
and
boozy
i
probably
should
have
opened
this
after
i
bought
it
or
better
yet
should
have
purchased
a
few
bottles
and
opened
them
over
time
to
compare
the
changes
as
it
ages
i
really
enjoy
the
beers
from
smuttynose
and
always
look
forward
to
my
next
glass
from
them
this
is
a
brewery
that
doesnt
get
enough
love
here
on
ba
this
particular
bottle
is
a
total
sipper
it
tastes
bigger
than
10
7
and
will
creep
up
on
you
very
quickly
so
take
your
time
and
enjoy
22
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
bottled
in
2009
pours
slightly
hazy
red
orange
color
with
a
small
fairly
dense
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
of
lace
small
patches
of
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
aromas
of
big
caramel
molasses
banana
orange
zest
clove
spices
and
a
bit
of
booze
very
nice
and
balanced
aromas
taste
of
big
caramel
banana
molasses
citrus
light
fruits
light
vanilla
spices
and
maple
syrup
no
real
amount
of
bitterness
noticed
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
caramel
light
fruits
molasses
and
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
medium
carbonation
and
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
warming
on
the
finish
noticed
great
balance
of
flavors
the
alcohol
definitely
cleans
the
palate
with
every
sip
and
doesnt
detract
from
the
flavor
profile
at
all
nice
drinkability
but
it
is
still
a
sipper
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
wheat
wine
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
smooth
for
the
level
of
alcohol
o
guess
i
just
wasnt
wowed
by
this
i
love
american
barleywines
but
this
takes
on
a
bit
of
a
different
direction
not
having
a
hop
presence
results
in
more
of
a
syrupy
concoction
in
my
opinion
there
was
depth
in
the
taste
but
not
very
much
diversity
o
a
decent
brew
to
me
its
pretty
much
all
barleywine
though
its
only
my
second
example
of
the
style
and
the
founders
style
version
i
had
first
rocked
my
frigging
socks
off
i
think
this
would
be
interesting
aged
in
oak
but
would
get
way
to
hot
in
a
bourbon
barrel
worth
picking
up
overall

im
a
fan
smuttynose
wheat
wine
was
the
first
i
ever
had
of
the
style
a
few
years
ago
when
i
was
still
pretty
fresh
in
the
craft
beer
world
i
really
want
to
try
this
fresh
and
also
with
23
years
on
it
to
compare
to
where
its
at
right
nowfrankly
i
didnt
even
realize
this
was
aged
about
10
months
because
i
kept
waiting
for
a
good
reason
to
open
it
either
way
i
like
it
the
way
it
is
now
and
while
its
not
for
everyone
as
i
think
is
common
to
the
style
in
general
this
is
my
idea
of
a
nonis
sipper
warm
fruity
rich
and
boozy
o
when
i
noticed
the
hopcentric
side
of
the
beer
i
decided
to
drink
it
now
instead
of
aging
it
but
now
i
have
some
wonders
certainly
some
carbonation
would
help
this
beer
but
in
any
case
id
like
to
try
this
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
some
time
well
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
of
this
if
you
can
draft
to
snifter
looks
good
however
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
wheat
wine
so
this
portion
of
the
review
is
somewhat
arbitrary
smell
is
good
very
similar
to
a
barleywine
the
taste
is
where
it
differentiates
itself
from
a
bw
not
better
not
worse
just
different
and
refreshingly
so
much
more
candied
up
front
and
throughout
for
that
matter
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
good
too
especially
for
a
big
beer
i
couldnt
do
too
many
of
them
because
of
how
candied
they
are
but
its
a
nice
alternative
to
a
big
beer
2009
vintage
pours
from
the
22oz
bomber
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
quickly
vanishes
lots
of
fizz
in
the
head
but
little
evidence
of
any
carbonation
inside
the
glass
thee
aroma
is
quite
similar
to
apple
juice
in
fact
its
almost
identical
1st
sip
brings
a
semisweet
taste
of
fruit
apples
raisins
plums
bananas
with
a
soft
hint
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
understated
perhaps
due
to
2
years
of
aging
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
on
the
thick
syrupy
side
but
not
in
a
bad
way
imho
halfway
through
the
first
pouring
and
i
can
already
start
to
feel
the
11
alcohol
starting
to
sneak
up
on
me
the
muting
of
the
alcohol
from
aging
makes
the
drinkability
high
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
satisfying
beverage
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
replacement
now
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
wait
2
years
to
sample
it
o
solid
wheatwine
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
for
a
beer
that
isnt
of
my
favorite
style
i
quite
enjoyed
this
pours

o
drinkability
is

uit
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
alot
of
share
a
bomber
o
this
is
the
first
wheatwine
ive
had
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
to
me
this
tasted
much
like
a
strong
double
ipa
mixed
with
an
english
barleywine
a
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
o
another
good
beer
from
smuttynose
however
rating
it
to
style
or
to
enjoyment
is
the
ultimate
question
this
guy
is
more
of
a
barelywine
but
nonetheless
anextremely
enjoyable
beer
medium
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
this
beer
is
surprisingly
smooth
the
lack
of
carbonation
has
amazingly
little
effect
on
the
drinkability
while
it
is
rather
sticky
and
almost
syrupy
once
warm
it
is
still
easily
enjoyable
skål
o
overall
a
much
better
beer
than
the
barleywine
though
this
had
the
advantage
on
aging
a
year
sweeter
and
less
alcohol
would
have
it
again
overall
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
overall
i
enjoyed
my
first
wheatwine
overall
nice
beer
would
drink
it
again
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
burnt
caramel
sweetness
pervading
the
beer
surprisingly
dark
malt
flavors
are
coming
forth
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
nah
alcohol
swoops
in
to
rescue
the
day
from
the
dreaded
cloying
demonbeast
shockingly
to
me
this
brew
becomes
more
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
as
the
ounces
pass
i
think
i
would
like
this
better
fresh
but
it
is
quite
tasty
even
now
all
the
ingredients
come
together
nicely
and
make
the
whole
tastier
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
color
me
impressed
balanced
but
big
and
enjoyable
easy
does
it
on
this
one
overall
its
good
but
doesnt
differentiate
itself
enough
from
a
barleywine
to
really
stick
in
my
head
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
hazy
barely
transparent
coppery
redbrown
with
a
thick
finebubbled
fairly
persistent
pale
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
aroma
is
wheaty
and
fruity
the
latter
an
interesting
mix
of
apple
and
citrus
with
a
hint
of
an
alcohol
bite
fruity
wheaty
flavor
has
an
undertone
of
barleywine
i
e
serious
alcohol
content
and
equal
parts
sweetness
and
bitterness
very
tasty
texture
is
rough
and
rowdy
leaving
behind
a
nice
fizz
heartily
recommended
o
a
very
interesting
beer
like
a
barley
wine
but
smoother
definitely
a
big
beer
it
takes
a
while
to
drink
it
down
interesting
but
perhaps
not
my
favorite
a
bit
hot
and
the
flavors
arent
really
all
that
exciting
here
drinkablility
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
high
abv
the
wheat
gives
it
slightly
more
light
version
of
what
you
get
out
of
barley
but
still
real
big
flavor
this
beer
was
good
but
i
would
have
fall
short
of
calling
it
great
and
as
my
first
example
of
the
style
it
was
more
okay
then
amazing
a
unique
style
of
beer
i
will
have
try
again
do
have
admit
though
the
beer
did
grow
on
me
and
certainly
started
appreciate
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
o
i
dig
the
style
and
this
a
good
overall
beer
i
want
more
wheat
wines
to
compare
it
to
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
althuogh
it
wasnt
great
it
wasnt
horrible
i
should
let
one
sit
in
the
basement
for
a
littlewhile
and
give
it
a
go
pretty
interesting
and
unique
ale
enjoying
it
immensely
but
not
sure
its
something
i
would
come
back
to
glad
to
have
it
once
though
but
dont
expect
the
same
taste
as
a
barleywine
othis
is
meshing
extremely
well
with
the
ham
and
turkey
sandwich
that
im
eating
im
finding
out
though
that
this
is
a
bomber
that
is
best
shared
with
a
friend
the
tastes
though
not
extremely
bad
just
arent
something
that
i
want
a
lot
of
right
now
or
ever
i
think
this
beer
needs
a
bit
more
carbonation
okay
a
lot
more
carbonation
it
just
isnt
something
ill
be
getting
again
ill
admit
i
always
though
the
whole
wheat
wine
concept
was
a
little
weird
now
i
believe
it
even
more
overall
pretty
mellow
and
drinkable
considering
how
many
brain
cells
it
is
sending
to
an
early
grave
this
is
a
reading
poetry
on
a
snowy
evening
in
a
mountain
cabin
kind
of
beer
but
a
pretty
good
one
d
heavy
but
still
pretty
drinkable
the
10
7
abv
shows
here
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
well
balanced
the
flavors
are
strong
so
this
is
pretty
much
a
sipping
beer
but
very
enjoyable
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
wheat
wine
flavors
but
it
is
a
bit
thin
without
much
depth
perhaps
a
little
age
will
help
bring
things
together
but
that
may
make
it
even
thinner
the
brassy
flavor
was
a
bit
off
putting
and
soon
became
stronger
than
the
other
malt
flavors
d
a
slow
sipper
pretty
delicious
in
a
desert
kind
of
way
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
consumed
a
beer
with
more
malt
and
sweetness
in
it
its
kind
of
like
drinking
butterscotch
interesting
felt
this
was
too
similar
to
a
normal
barley
wine
i
thought
that
this
would
have
been
a
little
bit
different
expected
it
to
be
lighter
i
guess
to
me
not
much
really
stood
out
and
made
much
of
a
difference
it
was
a
brownish
colored
brew
with
a
little
head
that
survived
for
a
little
while
the
flavors
in
this
beer
was
strong
for
sure
i
would
try
this
again
in
hopes
of
enjoying
this
a
little
more
the
second
time
around
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
as
a
relatively
new
style
i
have
not
had
much
to
sample
just
yet
however
based
on
the
description
this
appears
to
be
a
winner
d
a
decent
brew
overall
not
something
to
quaff
but
tasty
nonetheless
overall
this
is
a
beer
to
age
only
if
you
crave
caramel
malt
sweetness
between
your
teeth
not
the
best
of
the
smutty
big
beer
series
but
its
pretty
darn
good
big
beer
series
ill
say
poured
into
a
tall
more
fluteshaped
snifter
with
a
deep
solid
dark
honey
brown
body
and
a
nice
tan
one
finger
head
to
cap
it
this
beer
smells
incredibly
sweet
i
cant
exactly
put
my
finger
on
its
very
fruity
and
sugary
even
any
hops
presence
is
muted
by
the
incredibly
wheaty
profile
of
the
wheat
wine
the
bar
i
had
this
beer
at
listed
it
at
12
abv
and
you
certainly
notice
it
great
beer
to
have
if
your
in
the
mood
for
something
big
smuttynose
did
a
credible
job
with
a
style
that
i
find
intriguing
and
difficult
to
be
fair
im
not
enthralled
with
wheatwines
nonetheless
this
ones
alright
i
do
think
the
strong
citric
fruit
presence
is
why
it
succeeds
it
works
well
with
the
heavy
wheat
presence
if
you
havent
tried
a
wheatwine
before
this
is
a
great
place
to
start
i
cant
say
this
is
the
best
of
the
style
but
its
rather
friendly
all
around
and
is
a
little
better
than
the
score
probably
suggests
d
this
one
needs
much
more
time
before
visiting
again
probably
more
like
45
years
time
d
i
realize
that
this
is
a
sipper
but
most
sippers
ive
experienced
have
flavors
that
can
stand
up
to
the
alcohol
in
them
that
is
not
the
case
here
the
slightly
tasty
faint
sweet
notes
are
outweighed
entirely
by
the
ethanol
not
looking
for
another
glass
of
this
d
a
strong
brew
proudly
representing
a
strong
style
overall
just
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
may
need
to
get
another
one
of
these
and
set
it
aside
for
a
while
to
see
if
it
can
mellow
out
this
is
a
very
interesting
mix
making
for
a
nice
slow
sipper
overall
this
is
a
straightforward
malt
and
alcohol
explosion
in
your
mouth
while
the
malt
does
offer
some
complexity
and
tries
its
best
to
balance
that
alcohol
it
does
push
toward
overly
hot
at
times
this
beer
would
likely
cellar
quite
well
mellowing
out
in
time
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
it
and
a
must
try
for
any
barleywine
lover
d
pretty
good
drinkability
it
is
a
sipper
for
sure
but
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
it
drinks
pretty
much
like
a
barleywine
there
is
quite
a
big
alcohol
presence
and
that
mixed
with
the
sweetness
drug
down
the
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
all
in
all
i
really
like
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
this
was
my
first
wheat
wine
and
i
wish
more
breweries
would
make
this
style
i
would
for
sure
try
this
beer
again
very
drinkable
great
example
of
a
wheat
wine
but
not
an
every
day
beer
as
per
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
style
that
needs
to
be
explored
more
by
me
and
breweries
this
is
only
my
fourth
wheatwine
and
it
is
very
good
and
just
different
enough
from
barleywines
to
make
me
want
to
buy
everyone
that
pops
up
on
store
shelves
around
me
a
big
flavorful
beer
for
a
good
price
poured
a
slow
to
emerge
34
head
with
lots
of
tiny
slow
bubbles
rising
through
a
hazy
red
body
quite
the
rich
taste
with
caramel
and
malt
barleywine
indeed
and
with
a
hoppiness
added
comparable
to
many
ipas
the
lady
of
the
house
loved
it
too
and
thats
saying
something
high
abv
makes
it
tough
to
drink
much
off
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
very
small
latedeveloping
head
that
produces
a
small
fizz
of
light
tan
head
and
no
lacing
whatever
the
smell
is
strong
syrupy
and
with
a
distinct
tang
of
copper
like
licking
an
old
penny
the
flavor
is
quote
sweet
and
almost
sodalike
with
a
big
round
bite
of
wheat
and
a
rich
plummy
syrup
with
strawberry
and
tropical
fruit
the
finish
has
that
same
odd
old
copper
metallic
tang
the
booze
is
strong
but
muddled
like
a
fruity
tropical
drink
it
almost
has
the
feel
of
a
maitai
with
a
candyish
finish
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
and
wheatwines
in
general
seems
like
some
breweries
use
a
hefeweizen
yeast
and
get
some
banana
or
bubblegum
esters
which
this
one
does
not
tasty
but
a
little
too
boozy
pours
a
nice
hazy
orangish
reddish
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
with
visible
yeast
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
with
a
sweet
sugary
smell
along
with
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
hop
presence
along
with
a
slight
alcohol
smell
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
big
sweet
flavor
there
are
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
ctirus
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
okay
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
it
is
a
so
so
easy
drink
4
0
d
its
a
shame
that
no
one
gives
a
damn
about
wheatwines
and
only
a
handful
of
breweries
make
them
theyre
about
as
good
as
barleywines
which
dont
get
enough
respect
either
anyway
this
is
a
solid
beer
not
the
greatest
in
any
aspect
but
good
in
them
interesting
booziness
to
this
makes
it
almost
taste
like
a
training
whiskey
which
is
very
nice
for
me
since
i
can
only
handle
whiskey
well
in
limited
concentrations
a
fairly
average
wheatwine
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
are
decent
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
one
d
this
is
a
thick
sweet
big
beer
but
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
sipper
for
sure
but
delicious
and
complex
i
am
once
again
impressed
by
smuttynose
a
tremendous
beer
that
has
aged
rather
gracefully
in
my
opinion
this
one
still
has
legs
i
would
wager
it
is
still
tasty
in
another
couple
years
very
smooth
for
a
higher
abv
beer
flavors
are
pleasant
never
overwhelming
d
the
alcohol
isnt
too
strong
and
had
a
unique
and
interesting
tastebut
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
like
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
below
average
drinkability
is
good
i
really
liked
the
flavors
it
brought
it
was
a
very
flavorful
beer
overall
with
some
bold
flavors
to
it
they
all
came
together
nicely
though
and
made
a
great
beer
im
really
starting
to
love
this
style
of
beer
and
this
was
another
very
good
version
of
the
style
drinkability
is
very
high
very
nice
beer
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
about
halfway
through
the
first
glass
this
is
a
big
beer
that
deserves
to
be
shared
dit
goes
down
easily
each
time
i
drink
it
i
want
another
sip
pours
dark
orange
with
little
head
and
some
floaties
present
smells
sweet
wheaty
and
like
golden
molasses
with
some
hop
and
spice
notes
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
thankfully
much
less
sweet
firm
and
earthy
with
some
good
spice
notes
some
nice
pineyspicy
hoppiness
and
a
honeyed
finish
firm
and
almost
chewy
in
the
mouth
this
is
obviously
strong
but
the
alcohol
itself
is
fairly
well
hidden
the
high
hop
levels
help
to
camoflauge
the
sweetness
and
overall
make
this
beer
seem
pretty
big
for
the
style
good
beer
but
its
flat
now
would
love
to
have
a
fresh
bottle
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
too
cloying
and
strong
and
out
of
balance
2007
vintage
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
murky
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
booze
caramel
molasses
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
one
wasnt
that
bad
usually
i
dont
enjoy
wheatwines
so
that
is
saying
a
lot
the
taste
on
this
one
was
definitely
a
lot
better
than
the
smell
for
sure
the
taste
of
it
was
nicely
balanced
with
the
alcohol
by
some
of
the
sweetness
from
the
caramel
and
molasses
notes
the
aroma
was
just
plain
harsh
to
put
it
lightly
i
could
see
this
one
aging
for
a
bit
longer
myself
d
a
bomber
is
probably
it
for
the
night
maybe
follow
it
by
an
imperial
stout
12oz
heat
after
23
years
was
a
bit
surprising
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
another
08
and
leave
it
for
a
few
more
years
i
guess
ill
have
to
get
a
10
and
leave
it
for
5
years
or
so
the
body
was
thick
sticky
sweet
and
full
drinkability
was
very
good
for
a
beer
this
size
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
just
not
what
i
expect
from
the
style
this
is
the
type
of
review
i
have
problems
with
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
what
i
was
looking
for
this
style
is
generally
not
so
thick
and
sweet
and
is
crisper
and
lighter
worth
trying
when
you
can
just
dont
expect
to
get
what
the
says
it
is
rounding
out
the
flavor
is
a
mild
heat
that
i
can
only
classify
as
acceptable
however
smuttynose
has
really
won
me
over
with
this
one
theyve
really
managed
to
create
a
big
beer
with
a
mildness
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
many
and
a
robustness
exalted
by
few
drinkability
is
surprisingly
well
for
being
10
7
and
loaded
with
malts
and
sweetness
i
expected
a
lot
more
boozy
taste
and
sticky
finish
but
it
really
had
neither
the
long
finish
is
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
drinking
this
fast
that
and
not
getting
drunk
too
fast
i
had
no
idea
this
beer
would
taste
like
this
i
expected
something
like
a
caramely
double
white
or
maybe
an
american
barleywine
with
some
wheat
influence
both
of
which
sound
at
least
interesting
what
i
got
was
a
wellcrafted
beer
suited
exactly
to
my
tastes
another
exceptional
beer
from
smuttynose
and
a
great
complement
to
their
hoppy
tropicalfruit
oriented
barleywine
in
the
big
beer
series
decent
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
an
orangey
brown
with
a
dirty
yellow
white
1
finger
head
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
clung
a
bit
to
the
side
and
had
small
streams
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
sweet
up
front
with
hints
of
bitter
wheat
in
the
end
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
felt
very
good
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
and
was
well
carbonated
well
balanced
mostly
hid
the
abv
but
it
still
hit
fairly
hard
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
perfectly
matched
level
of
carbonation
im
not
a
big
fan
of
most
barleywines
but
this
is
a
style
i
could
certainly
get
used
to
beer
is
pretty
sweet
strong
alcohol
character
odd
bitterness
its
dry
on
the
finish
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
for
an
11
beer
my
hand
hurts
im
not
typing
anymore
d
quite
drinkable
if
you
do
not
absolutely
hate
wines
again
i
hate
describing
a
beer
this
way
but
its
consistency
is
similar
i
would
heed
a
warning
though
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
brew
overall
overall
a
nice
one
to
try
with
some
age
on
it
the
beer
pours
an
absolutely
gorgeous
ruby
with
bright
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
light
two
fingers
of
beige
head
form
and
while
retention
and
lacing
arent
great
given
the
alcohol
i
cant
hold
that
against
smuttynose
wheat
wine
too
much
the
nose
gives
me
a
little
cause
for
concern
as
while
theres
a
certain
spiciness
to
it
the
predominant
aroma
is
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
better
as
some
sweetness
from
the
wheat
shows
up
to
help
the
spiciness
but
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
too
prevalent
on
my
palate
for
this
beer
to
make
a
great
impression
its
a
shame
too
as
a
beer
with
this
great
a
mouthfeel
deserves
to
be
supporting
top
notch
flavors
the
body
is
as
rich
as
it
could
possibly
be
without
becoming
cloying
and
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
very
nicely
understated
the
great
mouthfeel
helps
make
this
beer
drinkable
but
with
so
much
boozy
flavors
flying
around
it
cant
be
anything
more
than
a
sipper
smuttynose
wheat
wine
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
only
reason
id
really
be
interested
in
revisiting
it
is
to
see
it
with
a
few
years
of
age
and
less
alcohol
heat
on
it
dglad
i
tried
it
smuttynose
makes
some
nice
brews
i
have
really
enjoyed
their
big
beer
series
keep
em
coming
drinkability
moderate
at
best
due
to
the
heat
as
it
could
really
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
a
bit
all
in
all
its
definitely
a
nice
beer
though
i
really
like
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
based
on
what
ive
tried
so
far
drinkability
is
pretty
good
considering
the
abv
it
might
have
been
a
good
idea
to
split
this
with
someone
i
wish
i
had
purchased
more
bottles
when
it
was
in
all
the
stores
i
will
admit
that
the
second
pour
isnt
nearly
as
satisfying
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
d
its
a
bit
of
a
mess
maybe
with
some
time
things
will
level
out
and
itll
come
together
very
hot
and
a
tough
drink
overall
a
good
beer
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
highly
hopped
beers
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
was
surprised
that
it
clocks
in
at
70
ibus
as
it
doesnt
taste
that
high
2008
vintage
22oz
bottle
served
in
my
dt
tulip
poured
a
semitranslucent
plum
with
a
quarter
inch
loose
tancolored
head
that
quickly
dispersed
into
a
band
of
bubbles
and
a
slick
of
foam
some
large
globules
of
lacing
appear
on
the
tilt
side
of
the
glass
nose
reveals
caramel
toffee
dark
fruit
toasted
malt
and
booze
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggests
there
also
some
bittering
hops
in
the
flavor
profile
and
an
alcohol
quality
that
borders
on
caustic
and
presents
itself
throughout
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
prickly
carbonation
level
a
slight
viscosity
to
the
consistency
and
some
residual
alcohol
heat
that
lingers
at
the
finish
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
definitely
allow
this
one
to
warm
to
round
out
the
flavors
and
disperse
the
carbonation
best
shared
between
one
or
two
friends
the
alcohol
is
notable
but
isnt
the
predominate
flavor
mostly
malty
with
very
little
wheat
bite
the
swallow
has
some
warming
brandy
elements
and
a
touch
of
hop
the
aftertaste
is
longlasting
alcohol
with
a
background
of
distant
wheat
finally
closer
to
a
barley
wine
imho
rich
bodied
this
is
a
sippers
beer
d
just
an
average
barleywine
the
wheat
characteristics
dont
really
shine
out
d
odd
style
which
ive
had
a
few
of
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
this
is
a
definite
sipper
due
to
high
and
noticeable
abv
not
bad
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
interesting
enough
to
try
again
going
to
age
this
one
for
a
year
or
so
before
try
number
two
drinkability
at
this
abv
this
beer
is
certainly
a
one
a
night
beer
and
a
beer
for
sipping
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
that
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
to
age
for
a
year
or
so
at
the
moment
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
but
it
doesnt
grab
me
the
way
some
barley
wines
do
it
is
a
nice
enough
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
with
some
age
but
im
not
thinking
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
in
the
future
i
really
like
big
boozy
barley
wines
so
it
makes
sense
that
i
loved
this
stuff
too
im
not
positive
that
i
would
be
able
to
distinguish
wheat
from
barley
wines
but
definitely
enjoyed
that
little
extra
kick
the
wheat
seems
to
have
given
the
abv
obviously
holds
the
drinkability
back
and
its
a
definite
sipper
but
i
would
love
to
get
another
chance
to
drink
this
one
thanks
again
eric
t
the
taste
follows
the
nose
alcoholic
strong
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
plenty
of
spicy
snappy
wheat
d
this
is
something
i
would
really
only
want
one
of
in
a
session
i
think
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
i
enjoyed
throwing
this
into
the
mix
smuttynose
makes
a
lot
of
good
beer
in
my
opinion
so
im
sure
this
one
is
fantastic
but
i
would
need
someone
who
is
more
familiar
with
this
style
to
second
that
emotion
a
little
too
sweet
to
much
more
than
a
serious
sipper
but
i
liked
it
for
what
it
was
a
giant
boozy
tasty
beer
note
2009
vintage
june
is
a
sweaty
month
here
in
boston
and
that
also
did
not
work
in
favour
of
this
beer
mf
is
medium
and
smooth
nothing
really
to
complain
about
could
potentially
use
a
little
more
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
the
sweetness
put
it
down
a
bit
maybe
some
more
hops
would
balance
this
out
as
such
it
stands
as
an
english
barleywine
with
a
bit
of
wheat
and
for
some
reason
i
just
dont
like
it
very
much
d
pretty
good
but
certainly
not
something
i
need
22oz
of
cheers
notes
hmmm
not
sure
this
goes
to
the
top
of
the
wheatwines
ive
had
but
typically
i
find
the
range
within
the
style
pretty
stimulating
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
more
so
i
think
im
influenced
by
its
great
pricequality
ration
at
least
with
this
group
of
smuttynose
bottles
that
were
simply
amazingly
priced
drinkability
a
hot
mess
of
a
beer
if
you
love
the
taste
of
alcohol
this
is
for
you
d
certainly
warms
the
cheeks
up
may
be
a
little
offputting
on
a
warm
day
slow
sipper
here
for
sure
eh
if
id
wanted
an
american
barleywine
id
have
bought
one
all
in
all
a
fun
one
to
try
and
a
decent
bottle
to
split
especially
with
pears
and
cheese
overall
this
is
a
good
offering
in
the
big
beer
series
from
smuttynose
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
stiff
but
would
feel
nice
on
a
cold
night
i
like
the
caramel
and
herbal
notes
in
the
flavor
but
beyond
that
nothing
is
really
pulling
back
in
i
may
pick
up
another
bottle
for
the
cellar
and
see
what
happens
in
a
couple
more
years
still
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
see
it
what
an
amazing
beer
malt
like
a
killer
english
barleywine
just
classic
d
a
rich
experience
for
sure
this
brew
is
meant
for
the
courageous
definitely
worth
a
shot
as
it
is
a
great
companion
to
their
barley
wine
offering
22
ounce
bottle
from
2009
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddishamber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
decent
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
brown
sugar
caramel
malt
sweet
booze
maybe
brandy
or
sherry
and
some
dark
fruit
figs
cherries
the
beer
tastes
like
brown
sugar
earthy
hops
dark
fruit
caramel
malt
booze
and
some
butterscotch
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
rich
and
a
bit
syrupy
and
coating
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
going
down
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
i
liked
it
i
had
this
on
tap
and
loved
it
not
so
good
in
the
bottle
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
the
last
time
it
was
released
in
o8
i
didnt
like
it
too
much
alcohol
content
for
me
to
be
able
to
see
through
it
to
what
was
actually
happening
beyond
it
that
and
i
was
still
young
in
my
general
all
around
beer
nerdery
and
knowledge
since
these
have
been
back
on
the
shelves
as
of
late
i
figured
i
give
it
one
more
shot
this
time
while
still
having
a
strong
alcohol
presence
i
was
really
able
to
notice
the
other
flavors
shinning
through
the
nose
is
big
with
candied
sugar
tropical
fruits
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
similar
with
the
malt
backing
nicely
its
very
easy
drinking
and
as
it
warm
towards
room
temp
the
flavors
really
start
to
develop
starts
taking
on
a
butter
scotch
characteristic
i
think
ill
have
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
for
the
cellar
i
think
this
is
my
first
wheat
wine
and
id
have
to
say
i
like
it
a
lot
its
a
lot
like
a
barley
wine
only
different
in
the
ways
youd
expect
lighter
in
color
a
little
sweeter
fruitier
in
aroma
give
all
that
it
still
packs
the
same
punch
as
a
barley
wine
with
as
equally
complex
a
flavor
this
is
the
first
of
this
type
of
beer
i
bought
but
it
wont
be
the
last
dbig
barleywine
with
a
nice
hop
profile
extremely
tasty
and
nicely
balanced
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
do
recommend
since
its
a
unique
style
only
my
second
wheatwine
so
hard
to
say
which
one
represents
the
style
best
the
other
one
to
me
had
better
aroma
and
taste
and
ive
already
got
some
more
in
the
cellar
this
one
while
good
had
too
much
alcohol
that
overpowered
the
rest
of
the
flavor
its
not
available
here
so
hard
to
get
another
to
age
and
see
what
happens
to
it
so
this
is
probably
my
only
shot
at
it
nn
overall
a
nice
strong
beer
i
recommend
it
for
american
barleywine
fans
its
a
neat
twist
on
a
strong
beer
dmuch
easier
to
drink
than
a
typical
barleywine
due
to
the
sweetness
edit
this
beer
has
medium
toast
oak
chips
added
during
dry
hopping
so
i
was
right
about
the
oak
component
being
there
also
recently
had
a
2009
while
ok
raisins
making
it
substantially
similar
to
a
barleywine
style


this
went
down
well
enough
and
is
nice
to
split
with
someone
i
really
appreciate
beerguy
bringing
this
out
on
his
visit
to
seattle
as
i
know
these
wheat
wines
can
be
quite
pricey
royaltapr

with
coconut
flavors
so
authentic
fluffy
wheat
then
the
alcohol
bomb
but
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
although
the
11
alcohol
is
there
and
remains
a
bit
in
the
finish
however
at
times
alcohol
is
upfront
and
in
your
face
with
this
one
a
decent
wheat
wine
that
i
wish
i
had
cellared
for
a
couple
of
years

but
there
was
not

about
it
wheat
and
more
wheat
there
also
was
a

of

it

be
to

word
to
the
wise
do
not
try
to

this

by
yourself
bad

be

it
had
notes
of
pear
with
light
and
elongated
strips
of
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
phenolic
here
is
the
deal
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
amber
hued
glow
with
a
nose
that
blends
subdued
malts
this
may
be
better
not
from
cask
o
an
interesting
brew
not
what
i
expected
its
like
a
riesling
with
a
weissbier
and
while
its
novel
im
not
sure
how
much
i
like
it
this
beer
was
not
meant
to
be
on
cask
or
it
was
not
treated
properly
because
it
has
zero
carbonation
aside
from
ruining
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
i
think
this
made
the
beer
a
little
bit
blander
than
it
should
have
been
good
job
hiding
the
alcohol
though
not
very
impressive
chelsea
brewing
makes
some
wonderful
beers
in
particular
anything
found
on
cask
unfortunately
i
didnt
enjoy
this
offering
as
much
as
i
liked
its
name
ill
buy
into
the
concept
of
a
refreshingly
tart
citruisy
banana
tasting
beer
thats
brewed
slightly
stronger
for
the
long
cold
winter
season
problem
is
this
simply
isnt
that
d
nice
winter
wheat
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
including
some
requisite
flavors
and
subtle
additions
of
spices
and
cereal
grains
ontap
at
spyten
duvel
nice
white
soapy

a
sour
though
still
fresh
pale
wheat
i
am
not
particularly
picking
on
chelsea
but
my
observation
is
that
they
are
overated
a
cross
between
a
wheat
beer
and
a
barley
wine
is
the
word
on
it
but
i
dont
get
it
on
tap
at
colespoured
a
hazey
light
amber
ith
some
lighter
brown
tint
a
tight
formed
one
finger

toasted
weat
malt

with
a
hint
of

to
me
were
like
lightly
sweetened
creal
grain
with
light
noteds
of
lemon
and
a
little
orange
for
a
bigger
beer
it
went
down
easily
its
very
toasty
and
cereallike
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
had
this
ontap
at
the
blind
tiger
at
the
end
of
a
long
pubcrawling
day
listed
as
chelsea
winter
wheat
and
im
assuming
this
is
the
same
beer
a
very
good
session
beer
poured
with
a
big
head
which
goes
down
to
a
nice
lacing
hops
dominate
the
smell
and
that
can
be
a
good
thing
taste
is
very
balanced
you
get
some
hops
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
delicate
wheat
flavors
getting
some
wheat
beer
yeast
flavors
very
drinkable
due
to
the
balance
this
americanstyle
wheat
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
thin
white
foam
that
settled
quickly
the
smell
was
a
mild
malt
and
wheat
aroma
the
taste
was
a
tad
sour
dominant
flavors
were
malt
wheat
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
sour
the
body
and
carbonation
were
medium
the
hops
were
present
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
decent
wheat
beer
of
its
style
overall
a
decent
beer
but
the
sweetness
dominates
it
needs
a
bit
more
balance

the

this

nice

with

balance
and
very
smooth
to

on
i
would
definitely
put
this
under
the
old
ale
style
rather
than
wheatwine
but
other
than
that
it
was
nicely
enjoyable
overall
a
very
bland
and
disappointing
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
right
brain
but
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
love
this
brewery
their
location
and
their
restaurant
and
wish
them
nothing
but
the
best
but
this
beer
is
tough
on
the
pallet
i
would
actually
call
it
slightly
harsh
and
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
lets
cut
to
the
chase
i
have
had
several
other
high
alcohol
beers
7
50
abv
or
greater
that
were
less
overpowering
and
harsh
then
illegal
aleien
is
but
if
getting
lit
is
your
1
objective
down
a
pint
or
two
of
this
bad
boy
simply
put
one
sip
and
you
know
you
are
in
for
the
long
hall
you
will
be
wearing
the
proverbial
lamp
shade
at
some
point
in
the
evening
o
labeled
as
a
hybrid
kölsch
it
definitely
has
the
fruity
aspect
down
the
curveball
of
the
agave
and
both
the
flavor
and
sweetness
that
it
brings
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
is
the
highlight
of
the
beer
drinks
extremely
easily
for
being
7

worth
a

beer

i

just

for
this
light
beer
is
pretty
complex
crisp
and
easily
drinkable
great
bear
and
great
company
looking
forward
to
trying
other
great
beers
from
marshall
wharf
this
brew
has
morphed
into
about
8
according
to
the
brewery
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
white
head
almost
a
wheat
cracker
flavor
upfront
and
then
i
could
notice
the
blue
agave
flavor
some
minor
notes
of
hops
but
not
overpowering
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
off
the
breweries
tap
this
beer
was
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
snowwhite
head
the
onefinger
of
foam
retained
fairly
well
and
left
nice
fishnets
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
wheat
floral
hops
hints
of
malty
sweetness
and
some
dough
the
flavors
started
dry
with
some
hints
of
sweet
malt
in
the
middle
and
a
mild
tartness
from
the
wheat
the
blue
agave
nectar
that
was
used
to
make
the
beer
imparted
a
distinct
agavetequila
note
it
drank
like
a
pilsner
and
not
a
6
4
brew
dangerous
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
lightmedium
an
interesting
hybrid
and
highly
creative
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
and
bitter
but
is
evened
out
with
the
malt
sweetness
strength
is
well
hidden
the
first
taste
was
pretty
much
all
creamy
head
quite
surprising
for
the
style
after
the
head
faded
the
carbonation
tasted
a
little
flat
but
for
the
first
half
of
the
pint
it
was
quite
good
served
in
my
uprising
chalice
at
novare
res
this
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
and
has
a
thick
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
you
can
see
plenty
of
additional
carbonation
bubbles
rising
in
streams
inside
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
grass
which
isnt
too
surprising
considering
this
is
a
hybrid
kolschwheat
beer
this
is
a
fullbodied
beer
it
is
kind
of
thick
there
is
some
sweetness
up
front
in
the
taste
as
well
as
some
hop
bitterness
i
found
it
to
have
pleasing
amount
of
carbonation
according
to
the
breweys
website
this
beer
is
brewed
with
blue
agave
nectar
which
may
have
been
a
taste
i
couldnt
identify
they
also
say
it
is
served
on
a
nitrotap
which
explains
the
impressive
looking
head
overall
a
fine
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
a
very
good
one
to
enjoy
outside
in
the
sun
i
understand
why
people
dont
like
this
and
its
certainly
got
a
bit
of
a
bite
but
im
a
fan
i
liked
it
more
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
as
the
bottle
had
less
of
a
tequila
and
salt
flavor
but
all
in
all
was
still
a
pretty
accurate
depiction
of
a
margarita
though
perhaps
a
cheaper
one
i
went
into
this
with
low
expectations
and
was
still
disappointed
well
this
is
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
but
i
think
its
underrated
props
for
pretty
much
nailing
the
essence
of
a
tequilaforward
margarita
although
im
not
sure
anyone
wants
a
beer
to
taste
like
that
itll
be
interesting
how
this
thing
tastes
with
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
no
point
in
drinking
any
more
right
now
and
i
doubt
anyones
gonna
want
to
trade
for
this
lime
salt
and
tequila
are
all
present
along
with
a
fair
share
of
booze
the
citrus
component
comes
off
as
almost
plastic
strangely
while
it
sort
of
tastes
like
a
margarita
the
execution
is
lacking
here
its
an
overbearing
mix
of
sweet
salty
and
citrus
without
any
of
the
refreshing
qualities
of
a
good
margarita
perhaps
a
different
base
beer
with
significantly
lower
alcohol
and
sweetness
would
have
worked
better
for
this
idea
really
really
not
good
a
mess
of
a
beer
i
understand
their
goal
but
id
rather
and
quite
happily
drink
a
dozen
lime
a
ritas
than
have
to
suffer
through
this
again
smelled
like
vaginal
feet
sour
lime
light
tequila
very
sour
no
salt
smells
like
an
old
margarita
tastes
like
an
old
womans
vagina
foul
foul
i
shouldnt
need
to
justify
this
review
stuff
is
just
awful
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
faint
tequila
aroma
and
flavor
i
hate
tequila
i
hate
margaritas
i
like
this
the
beer
is
definitely
weird
but
the
goal
was
to
make
a
beer
that
tasted
like
a
margarita
and
i
think
they
made
a
great
effort
at
it
not
something
i
want
to
drink
every
day
but
huge
tequila
flavor
and
some
nice
acid
helps
them
meet
their
goal
and
that
is
how
i
was
judging
the
beer
offensive
flavor
out
of
balance
artificial
lime
profile
with
a
watered
down
mouthfeel
for
such
a
big
beer
not
a
sour
or
strong
ale
or
a
wheat
whine
but
a
mess
of
flavors
with
no
real
identity
i
drain
poured
this
smells
like
a
margarita
dead
on
tastes
really
weird
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
really
is
it
a
cocktail
inspired
beer
is
it
a
beer
inspired
cocktail
is
it
happy
hour
down
at
the
cabana
not
very
drinkable
kind
of
like
drinking
melted
alcoholic
ice
water
that
had
some
lime
soda
and
tequila
spilled
in
it
sorry
im
just
not
the
right
audience
for
this
one
overall
its
not
a
great
beer
but
at
least
i
have
to
give
them
props
for
trying
something
very
unique
executed
decently
but
just
hard
to
have
serving
type
bottle
this
beer
definitely
isnt
something
most
people
will
enjoy
i
myself
am
a
tequila
lover
so
i
definitely
enjoyed
what
this
beer
had
to
offer
the
smell
was
spot
on
but
the
flavor
was
a
little
too
barrel
heavy
for
me
id
give
this
about
a
year
in
the
bottle
to
see
how
it
develops
interesting
what
they
were
going
for
and
while
it
hits
on
some
notes
this
is
an
overall
miss
for
me
tart
sour
but
not
overpowering
tequila
is
present
but
not
offensive
light
saltiness
this
is
surprisingly
a
nice
recreationintegration
of
a
margarita
and
beer
enjoyable
but
one
glass
is
probably
the
max
i
can
handle
those
mad
scientists
at
the
bruery
have
gone
way
outside
the
box
again
with
roble
blanco
it
is
a
departure
from
any
wheatwine
or
barrel
aged
sour
that
ive
ever
had
but
its
quite
the
southoftheborder
taste
adventure
beergarita
not
what
i
had
expected
was
really
good
didnt
taste
like
a
margarita
though
reminded
me
of
good
tequila
havent
had
much
highend
tequila
though
hid
the
high
abv
extremely
well
gotta
give
it
to
the
bruery
for
doing
something
different
overall
not
the
best
just
weird
and
a
lot
of
tequilalime
to
it
would
not
want
to
have
it
again
nose
full
of
aloe
vera
raw
agave
a
little
salty
a
little
limey
a
little
awful
how
can
it
be
a
margaritalike
beer
when
its
such
a
sweet
malty
mess
i
tried
to
like
it
but
it
needs
to
be
more
sour
to
balance
it
out
tequila
everywhere
great
beer
nailed
it
smells
absolutely
awful
and
tastes
like
straight
tequila
agave
some
lime
and
slight
saltiness
on
the
palate
too
o
i
was
prepared
for
the
worst
but
i
actually
really
liked
this
a
lot
a
failure
for
most
but
a
definite
winner
in
my
book
its
easy
to
hate
this
beer
but
hear
me
out
if
this
was
served
to
me
blind
i
would
hate
it
but
trying
to
execute
a
margarita
beer
cant
be
easy
i
assume
but
for
what
it
is
the
bruery
nailed
it
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
margarita
mix
melded
with
the
boozy
sweetness
of
a
wheatwine
style
ale
known
as
white
oak
the
tequila
lime
and
salt
are
there
and
evenly
balanced
in
smell
and
taste
this
beer
is
exactly
how
the
label
reads
actually
maybe
a
little
better
because
i
thought
this
was
a
sour
ale
but
its
not
its
tart
but
not
sour
by
any
means
but
that
works
for
what
they
are
going
for
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
as
light
carbonation
represents
a
cocktail
beer
well
overall
i
am
impressed
with
what
they
achieved
here
i
am
disappointed
it
was
a
mystery
beer
as
i
honestly
would
not
want
more
than
one
i
expected
a
different
direction
for
the
mystery
beers
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
rating
had
this
the
other
day
at
work
and
it
was
amazing
when
it
is
chilled
the
downfall
is
that
it
is
a
little
grainy
at
the
end
just
a
little
too
much
salt
that
kind
of
lingers
for
too
long
do
not
let
the
beer
get
too
warm
ft
iso
overall
im
insulted
that
this
is
the
rs
mystery
beer
if
you
dont
live
close
enough
to
try
this
at
the
tasting
room
before
you
buy
heed
my
advice
and
skip
it
or
buy
it
at
your
own

friday
evening
a
confoundingly
pleasant
surprise
light
on
the
palate
yet
very
complex
lots
of
bourbon
aroma
without
overwhelming
other
elements
smooth
despite
its
strength
this
was
one
of
the
first
bba
beers
i
tried
6
years
ago
and
i
didnt
like
it
very
much
age
as
well
as
change
in

its

very
good
one
here
but
thats
what
i
expect
from
bruery
my
first
bruery
beer
2013
vintage
one
of
the
top
five
beers
that
i
have
had
in
the
last
calendar
year
i
have
some
difficulty
ascribing
the
flavors
mild
vanilla
darkened
a
bit
by
light
bourbon
in
the
background
apples
mild
sweetness
yet
a
very
mild
tartness
a
little
caramel
maybe
this
is
a
very
very
good
beer
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
with
a
good
friend
as
described
a
rich
and
interesting
beer
im
not
sure
how
ill
get
through
this
bottle
though
a
lot
of
complexity
and
depth
but
i
find
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
on
the
high
side
not
to
say
it
isnt
a
very
tasty
and
inspired
beer
which
it
is
a
lot
of
interesting
things
going
on
but
i
think
they
are
lessened
by
the
strength
and
sweetness
of
this
nevertheless
age
has
been
good
to
this
and
it
showed
a
good
performance
all
around
a
good
balance
struck
between
the
two
ales
tasted
after
a
year
of
aging
i
do
think
this
beer
will
develop
in
another
6
months
and
becomes
even
more
complex
the
one
i
tried
had
been
cellared
1
years
i
expect
it
to
get
even
better
with
age
o
for
some
reason
i
wasnt
anticipating
a
lightcolored
beer
here
mild
shock
but
a
pleasant
surprise
as
it
certainly
played
into
the
interpretation
of
flavors
while
it
packs
a
decent
punch
alcohol
wise
it
doesnt
come
across
as
heavy
or
filling
i
feel
theyve
made
a
fine
wheatish
beer
here
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
a
wonderful
quite
special
brew
coconut
vanilla
oak
barrel
wheat
body
quite
shy
on
showing
its
high
abv
very
complex
dangerously
drinkable
the
bruery
at
its
best
coconut
and
caramel
deliciousness
this
is
an
interesting
beer
style
the
breadiness
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
new
to
me
as
a
desirable
characteristic
but
works
well
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
slowly
sneaks
up
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
it
but
it
wont
be
the
last
a
bit
sour
for
my
taste
but
still
drinkable
beer
tasted
pretty
good
will
likely
not
get
it
very
often
though
o
an
interesting
wheatwine
that
is
quite
potent
in
the
citrus
realm
bright
golden
hued
with
vibrant
carbonation
and
brilliant
clarity
the
head
is
easily
an
inch
thick
of
tightly
woven
and
off
white
in
color
light
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
oak
and
pale
wheat
when
combined
almost
give
off
a
dry
cider
like
note
the
flavor
is
an
intense
blend
of
oak
and
pale
wheatwhich
like
the
aromaalmost
give
a
dry
cider
like
flavor
theres
a
residual
sweetness
that
lingers
that
i
find
a
bit
cloying
i
believe
the
bourbon
notes
and
the
oak
are
clashing
with
the
pale
wheat
the
palate
is
highly
carbonated
and
slightly
warm
from
the
alcohol
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
drank
much
lighter
than
i
expected
quite
a
gorgeous
beer
incredibly
complex
with
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
despite
the
strength
tart
ripe
apples
and
stone
fruit
covered
in
a
light
caramel
glaze
soft
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
with
just
the
right
touch
of
bourbon
a
delicate
beer
like
this
would
be
so
easily
overpowered
but
sweet
bourbony
notes
come
through
just
a
bit
on
the
back
end
and
compliment
some
of
the
more
savory
and
richer
notes
while
letting
some
of
the
brighter
fruit
notes
still
shine
complex
surprisingly
lighter
in
body
than
expected
the
wheat
really
creates
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
out
of
such
a
big
one
alcohol
heat
is
noticeable
on
the
back
end
but
provides
balance
to
the
intense
flavors
and
drys
out
the
finish
finishes
lingers
long
and
is
almost
tannic
in
that
it
scrubs
the
gums
very
nice
and
well
worth
the
bottle
cost
o
full
of
character
for
sure
but
it
takes
a
while
to
get
accustomed
to
it
great
clean
apples
supported
by
warm
caramel
malt
tease
the
olfactory
senses
with
a
refreshing
crisp
brew
to
come
but
it
turned
into
a
heavily
oakdominated
and
deceivingly
biting
flavor
i
ended
up
enjoying
it
overall
but
after
the
first
few
sips
i
was
reconsidering
my
choice
get
ready
for
an
adventure
with
this
one
taste
was
similar
to
the
nose
had
a
strong
weizenbockwheat
flavor
up
front
and
then
the
caramel
coconut
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
came
in
after
the
initial
swallow
heat
from
the
11
5
abv
was
pretty
pronounced
after
the
beer
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
had
expected
but
overall
was
a
tasty
beer
and
would
love
to
try
more
from
this
place
i
expect
great
things
from
a
brewery
that
call
themselves
the
bruery
they
live
up
to
the
name
while
enjoyable
it
would
be
better
served
with
a
strong
cheese
it
is
remarkably
similar
to
carbonated
white
wine
if
there
were
such
a
thing
o
nothing
to
seek
out
but
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
think
the
fullness
of
the
feel
is
the
best
part
o
not
bad
but
i
more
than
likely
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
picked
up
bottle
on
clearance
that
was
approaching
best
buy
date
great
looking
beer
not
quite
as
murky
as
a
wheat
with
good
head
that
does
not
stick
around
long
smell
is
awesome
hard
to
describe
but
wonderful
taste
was
very
interesting
could
not
compare
it
to
anything
the
boozy
taste
sticks
around
a
little
long
from
a
guy
who
likes
very
big
beers
definitely
more
of
a
sipper
but
a
very
good
one
with
interesting
taste
very
much
enjoyed
the
beer
and
definitely
worth
trying
as
it
is
a
bit
unique
interesting
beer
lots
going
on
and
it
transforms
greatly
from
cold
to
room
temp
misses
the
wow
factor
that
a
lot
of
bruery
beers
have
for
me
still
very
good
oddidnt
ever
think
about
purchasing
this
split
it
with
a
group
it
was
better
than
expected
definitely
unique
overall
a
huge
disappointment
as
a
barrel
aged
beer
also
makes
2
of
3
breury
beers
that
have
let
me
down
largely
the
other
was
just
good
not
great

buttery
and

with
hefty

of

grapes
peaty
and
boozy
bitter
and
sweet
with
a
dry

overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
pours
a
light
golden
body
hints
of
orange
with
decent
head
and
lace
a
funky
earthy
aroma
hits
me
and
theres
also
some
minor
oakiness
and
sweetness
as
well
the
oak
helps
keeps
things
balanced
and
smooth
as
there
is
something
akin
to
yeast
that
keeps
the
beer
fluffy
and
lively
and
then
some
sourtart
citric
flavors
and
then
a
finish
of
vanilla
sweetness
the
abv
is
rather
well
hidden
as
the
booziness
and
medicinalbarrel
taste
that
some
barrel
aged
beers
have
is
vaguely
there
on
backend
as
beer
warms
a
beer
that
is
out
there
as
it
touches
on
but
doesnt
excel
at
one
particular
taste
sensation
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
served
in
a
snifter
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
surprisingly
thick
creamy
head
that
retained
well
and
left
some
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
looked
pretty
nice
aroma
of
toasted
wheat
and
sweet
malts
candi
sugar
notes
of
stone
fruit
and
coconut
this
was
pretty
indicative
of
the
taste
wheat
and
pale
malts
fruity
peachy
flavors
on
the
sweeter
side
with
a
pretty
big
hit
of
fusel
alcohol
no
real
bourbon
or
barrel
notes
but
a
definite
coconut
sensation
came
through
body
was
medium
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
quite
unexpectedly
but
i
guess
it
would
have
been
less
drinkable
if
it
were
a
chewy
fullblown
malt
bomb
alcohol
was
present
for
sure
but
actually
it
wasnt
too
hot
not
bad
overall
but
not
great
i
was
glad
to
have
it
on
tap
instead
of
committing
to
a
bomber
o
i
declare
this
the
three
stooges
of
beerdom
all
the
flavors
do
is
get
jammed
in
a
doorway
with
the
sugary
sweetness
poking
the
fruit
esters
in
the
eyes
and
bonking
the
oak
barrel
in
the
head
theres
no
way
i
could
finish
a
whole
750
solo
which
is
why
i
split
it
with
a
couple
friends
dont
need
to
ever
have
this
one
again
i
really
hope
the
bottle
of
bois
im
sitting
on
isnt
like
this
m
medium
bodied
or
less
great
carb
very
drinkable
o
i
am
not
thrilled
with
the
price
on
bruery
offerings
but
i
have
really
enjoyed
a
majority
of
them
so
far
this
is
no
exception
as
i
really
enjoyed
it
for
the
abv
it
is
really
quite
drinkable
and
would
pair
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
the
bright
belgian
crosses
with
the
sweet
barrel
character
nicely
o
the
barrel
comes
on
a
bit
strong
even
after
the
5050
blend
that
wheatwine
must
have
really
been
a
barrel
bomb
on
its
own
an
interesting
blend
it
actually
meshes
quite
well
though
it
still
feels
somewhat
foreign
and
a
little
odd
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
its
a
very
thought
provoking

is
light
citrus
pear
apple
yeast
funk
dry

was
expecting
more
sweetness
on
the
nose
given
my
experience
with
white
chocolate
really
smells
like
a
saison
flavor
is
sweet
honey
apples
and
alcohol
presence
but
unexpectedly
light
bodied
maybe
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
alcohol
presence
doesnt
mend
well
here
and
is
slightly
offensive
no
trace
of
the
beer
that
i
tasted
in
wc
adequate
carbonation
that
prickles
the
tongue
dryish
finish
a
bit
disappointed
here
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
reminds
me
of
a
farmhouse
ale
probably
from
the
mischief
addition
as
i
seem
to
get
those
characteristics
along
with
the
big
bourbon
presence
not
a
bad
beer
worth
trying
overall
my
introduction
to
the
bruery
and
its
a
tasty
one
havent
had
a
blend
like
this
and
welcome
the
style
with
open
arms
wheat
really
makes
this
creamy
and
smooth
allowing
it
to
pack
a
lot
of
punch
its
still
hard
to
justify
its
30
price
tag
but
im
glad
i
can
come
out
of
this
saying
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
first
beer
from
the
bruery
on
paper
an
11
5
abv
wheatwine
with
half
of
it
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
sounds
like
a
defeating
task
to
drink
boozy
with
the
sweetness
from
all
of
the
malt
needed
to
establish
its
alcohol
content
only
added
on
to
by
the
bourbon
barrels
but
that
isnt
the
case
the
high
level
of
carbonation
and
belgian
forward
characteristics
help
to
make
this
not
only
enjoyable
but
drinkable
as
well
they
did
a
fantastic
job
at
making
a
potentially
intense
very
pronounced
boozy
mother
of
a
beer
into
one
that
is
well
rounded
soft
and
delicate
and
i
commend
them
for
that
sour
in
the
rye
is
next
and
i
cant
wait
overall
ive
had
better
from
the
bruery
but
i
suppose
they
cant
all
be
awesome
i
suppose
it
serves
a
purpose
and
it
is
a
different
blend
of
style
still
very
drinkable
refreshing
to
a
degree
and
high
abv
mixed
with
a
couple
o
painkillers
after
surgery
im
inclined
to
rate
this
one
higher
than
deserved
maybe
would
be
better
with
some
age
on
it
i
think
the
present
alcohol
just
gives
the
beer
a
boozy
spiciness
thats
hard
to
get
past
the
other
flavors
are
great
though
and
would
probably
shine
after
a
few
years
of
rest
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
orangish
with
a
huge
soapy
offwhite
head
that
fades
very
slowly
smell
is
citrusy
oak
and
belgian
yeast
taste
has
a
touch
of
tartness
some
citrus
and
carmel
a
little
boozy
but
not
overpowering
with
just
a
hint
of
the
barrel
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
little
dry
overall
it
is
good
if
you
like
wheat
wines
its
worth
a
try
o
the
label
speaks
the
truth
the
bourbon
is
applied
with
subtlety
giving
airs
of
wood
and
whiskey
to
the
mix
lots
of
fruits
for
fans
tropical
and
orchard
citrus
comes
through
assisted
by
the
hops
and
the
wheat
provides
some
characteristic
flavors
and
smells
this
came
across
like
a
wheat
tripel
bourbon
barrel
aged
cant
imagine
not
enjoying
this

quite
good

to
sip
on
for
the
abv
despite
the
moderate
warming
on
the
finish
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
an
interesting
blended
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
some
of
it
gets
lost
and
other
areas
dominate
a
little
more
then
others
a
ride
for
the
palate
though
glad
i
got
to
try
it
sometimes
a
big
beer
is
just
what
is
needed
and
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
straw
hue
with
a
one
finger
head
with
no
lacing
but
a
subtle
rimthe
smell
is
bourbonvanillabooze
and
coconutthe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
vanillacoconutcaramelboozecandy
and
is
finished
just
like
a
fine
white
port
with
a
touch
of
warming
bourbon
on
the
back
of
the
palette
and
overall
its
such
a
unique
drop
that
toes
the
boundaries
of
wheat
beer
and
wine
and
even
though
ive
tried
it
and
liked
it
i
probably
wouldnt
fork
out
the
big
dollars
on
it
again
cheers
interesting
take
on
a
strong
pale
ale
sort
of
like
a
tripel
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
seeing
as
im
not
a
big
belgian
fan
i
think
id
prefer
the
original
wheat
wine
instead
of
this
blend
with
mischief
interesting
and
oddly
refreshing
for
such
a
big
beer
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
overall
this
is
quite
good
though
quite
strong
overall
this
was
my
first
wheatwine
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
was
really
tasty
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
added
nice
additional
complexity
and
really
took
this
from
a
good
beer
to
a
really
good
beer
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
10oz
draft
pour
at
oblivion
in
orlando
this
is
a
wheatwine
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
blended
with
a
belgianstyle
golden
ale
the
taste
has
some
fruitiness
with
vanilla
and
oak
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
with
a
dry
and
slightly
spicy
finish
with
a
lingering
warmth
from
the
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
solid
wheatwine
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
o
phenomenal
beer
only
aging
half
of
it
in
the
bourbon
barrel
was
a
great
call
as
i
dont
see
the
subtle
notes
of
the
wheat
and
yeast
standing
up
to
much
more
probably
should
have
saved
this
brew
to
share
with
some
one
considering
i
dont
think
drinking
the
entire
thing
by
yourself
is
very
healthy
going
to
grab
another
to
cellar
as
i
imagine
this
brew
will
be
absolutely
incredible
with
a
few
years
like
the
best
in
the
admittedly
limited
examples
of
this
style
that
ive
tried
white
oak
possesses
a
heady
wheat
heft
aided
and
abetted
by
the
elevated
and
integrated
abv
an
attendant
fruitiness
and
here
some
overarching
whisky
barrel
indoctrination
thats
a
good
thing
oakey
dokey
indeed
o
a
solid
beer
im
not
exactly
a
fan
of
it
but
it
has
some
good
flavors
its
a
bit
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
i
love
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
has
nothing
to
combat
the
barrel
notes
maybe
a
75
ale
25
barrel
aged
ale
blend
would
suit
this
one
better
maybe
age
maybe
funk
overall
for
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
at
11
5
abv
this
was
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
a
good
blend
of
american
and
belgian
lovely
stuff
overall
best
beer
my
wife
has
ever
had
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
getting
i
enjoy
the
bruerys
eclectic
offerings
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
them
one
of
those
beers
that
i
liked
but
doubt
ill
be
dropping
the
cash
to
age
a
bottle
or
two
even
though
i
think
it
would
improve
drastically
im
stoked
to
get
the
bruery
here
in
alberta
but
so
far
im
overspending
o
good
example
of
a
style
thats
not
typical
for
me
nor
one
ive
had
a
bunch
of
i
like
the
complexity
and
ease
of
drinking
this
overall
sort
of
a
letdown
i
will
need
to
search
out
other
examples
of
this
style
a

d

its
surprisingly
refreshing
and
medium
bodied
for
a
partially
barrel
aged
beer
this
is
a
really
cool
take
on
mischief
and
pushes
it
up
to
another
level
jd
overall
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
such
a
good
blend
of
flavors
that
come
together
very
nicely
impressed
by
this
one
o
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
wheatwine
defintiley
worth
trying
and
worth
the
cash
such
a
great
brew
deff
reccommend
this
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
wheatwines
so
my
opinion
doesnt
count
for
much
here
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
the
high
carbonation
suits
it
well
it
opens
the
palate
and
intensifies
the
flavors
where
i
found
that
a
bit
of
degassing
tends
to
smooth
the
beer
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
after
trying
two
of
these
barrelaged
in
this
case
partially
barrelaged
wheatwines
i
must
confess
im
not
entirely
sold
on
the
concept
of
a
barrelaged
wheatwine
im
not
sure
that
the
grainy
cereallike
qualities
of
the
style
are
well
complemented
by
the
bourbon
notes
it
inherits
i
find
the
transition
on
the
palate
from
soft
wheat
to
harsh
booze
to
be
offputting
at
first
but
who
knows
it
might
be
a
taste
i
could
acquire
o
interesting
combo
that
some
thought
went
into
overall
4
25
a
wonderful
beer
from
the
bruery
which
is
probably
good
given
the
cost
of
this
particular
750
brings
to
mind
the
feel
of
cognac
or
even
moreso
a
strong
brandy
if
this
was
more
available
i
would
definitely
keep
it
around
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
minimal
clarity
and
pillowy
white
head
with
heavy
lacing
nose
has
a
strong
presence
of
wheat
and
lemon
bourbon
notes
come
through
and
offer
up
some
vanilla
and
oak
taste
is
fruity
and
citrusy
up
front
with
more
depth
and
complexity
as
it
sits
on
the
palate
bourbon
takes
ahold
by
mid
palate
and
some
dry
oaky
notes
on
the
finish
alcohol
is
relatively
low
key
as
it
is
overshadowed
by
orange
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
overall
the
citrus
and
wheat
really
take
center
stage
here
and
overshadow
the
bourbon
lots
of
bright
fruit
notes
almost
forgot
this
was
wheatwine
o
beer
that
makes
you
think
put
all
the
flavors
together
and
you
get
something
thats
anything
but
conventional
a
belgian
wheatwine
with
enough
wood
and
fruit
to
make
it
unique
even
after
i
look
at
the
empty
bottle
i
wonder
if
theres
anything
inherently
good
about
this
beer
that
makes
it
special
or
if
its
just
something
different
to
a
palate
that
demands
something
different
though
it
isnt
a
sour
in
the
rye
or
an
orchard
white
this
beer
is
damn
good
one
that
id
buy
again
at
a
moments
notice
if
it
wasnt
almost
a
dollar
an
ounce
o
really
enjoyed
bourbon
doesnt
dominate
wheatvanillacoconut
is
balanced
out
really
well
yes
finish
is
a
bit
boozy
in
the
finish
but
real
smooth
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
frothy
do
recommend
o
overall
a
nice
wheatwine
the
bourbon
and
oak
give
a
big
sweetness
enjoyable
but
a
bit
overly
sweet
and
i
tend
to
love
sweet
beers
every
time
i
have
a
wheatwine
my
mouth
says
wtf
lots
of
flavors
that
dont
mesh
nor
go
away
lol
this
one
is
even
more
over
the
top
and
if
this
is
wrong
to
my
tongue
i
dont
wanna
be
right
certainly
not
something
i
would
or
could
drink
daily
this
may
get
better
and
smooth
out
with
age
ill
grab
another
bottle
and
let
you
know
in
a
few
years
overall
white
oak
is
very
good
it
is
certainly
more
interesting
than
most
barleywineswheatwines
that
said
it
is
probably
a
bit
too
sweet
and
though
i
try
to
ignore
pricing
in
my
reviews
i
dont
think
id
be
willing
to
pay
its
fairly
high
price
for
a
second
pour
or
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
solid
quilt
of
light
yellow
foam
brilliant
clarity
smells
like
co2
pears
vanilla
some
apple
skin
some
dandelion
flavor
is
booze
sweet
malt
sweet
vanilla
some
bourbon
some
oak
some
more
pear
and
honeydew
full
bodied
with
moderately
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
meh
tastes
more
like
an
old
ale
than
a
wheatwine
and
although
im
not
a
wheatwine
fan
on
most
occassions
this
one
isnt
at
the
top
of
that
list
i
think
it
will
age
gracefully
however
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
too
much
pear
for
me
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
it
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
beer
just
taken
up
a
few
notches
heavier
mouthfeel
more
flavor
stronger
aroma
i
dont
get
the
impression
that
any
of
this
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
like
the
label
says
that
it
was
which
is
interesting
definitely
a
lot
going
on
in
this
one
o
i
think
that
this
is
a
solid
brew
all
the
way
around
it
has
a
nice
complexity
and
is
nicely
balanced
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
and
it
would
be
great
as
the
weather
continues
to
warm
up
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
often
strong
beer
o
a
very
good
beer
but
at
16
a
bottle
i
probably
will
not
buy
it
again
overall
its
good
but
had
better
and
the
oak
and
buttery
character
is
overpowering
with
not
enough
chewy
wheat
backbone
overall
a
decent
and
big
wheat
beer
with
a
bit
of
that
hefe
flavour
going
on
not
really
my
thing
but
its
not
terrible
overall
a
huge
boozy
dynamic
well
balanced
and
well
blended
beer
very
unique
stuff
as
usual
from
the
bruery
i
think
this
beer
will
only
get
more
refined
with
age
im
definitely
looking
to
aging
some
bottles
of
this
just
to
see
how
it
develops
highly
recommended
for
someone
who
is
looking
to
try
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
that
isnt
a
stout
overall
fascinating
combination
of
flavors
not
convinced
it
works
all
that
well
but
only
the
booze
is
offensive
the
rest
of
it
is
just
a
crazy
big
wheat
beer
d
very
interesting
mix
of
flavors
but
very
well
balanced
and
complex
the
complex
light
dessert
flavors
really
complement
the
alcohol
in
a
beer
that
seems
refined
and
is
both
complex
and
delicate
this
is
maybe
my
third
time
with
this
beer
and
i
have
always
been
equally
impressed
with
it
each
time
a
great
example
of
how
barrelaging
needs
to
evolve
with
a
careful
touch
of
blending
and
a
remarkable
balance
that
brings
out
a
deeper
flavor
to
the
palate
i
will
be
buying
this
again
highly
recommended
o
very
interesting
beer
well
balanced
and
hit
on
all
cylinders
d
this
was
nice
and
refined
and
complex
well
executed
version
of
a
difficult
style
with
nice
scent
and
taste
and
body
it
seemed
like
it
could
age
really
well
but
it
was
also
very
good

includes

slight

slight

some

as
advertised
all
the
flavored
work
well

and
the
beer
is
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
o
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
is
tasty
the
mouthfeel
isnt
spectacular
at
least
not
upfront
i
dig
whats
going
on
here
with
all
the
flavor
but
having
recently
had
wc
this
falls
short
and
i
hate
to
compare
the
two
but
i
believe
the
base
beers
are
the
same
despite
all
that
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
the
belgian
sugars
and
other
flavors
coming
through
nicely
o
im
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
maybe
a
little
age
would
help
this
a
little
expensive
for
what
i
got
out
of
it
i
might
come
back
to
this
later
o
while
high
gravity
wheat
beers
dont
really
make
sense
to
me
i
actually
think
this
would
have
been
a
pretty
decent
beer
sans
the
bourbon
barrel
treatment
the
bruerys
website
describes
white
oak
as
50
wheatwine
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
50
mischief
our
golden
strong
ale
now
things
are
starting
to
make
sense
this
one
really
surges
with
booze
after
a
while
and
its
not
exactly
easy
drinking
medium
body
and
carbonation
slightly
sticky
fruity
and
hot
finish
pretty
wild
i
probably
would
have
preferred
to
split
this
three
rather
than
two
ways
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
hazy
yellow
pour
plus
sized
white
head
the
aroma
was
kinda
weak
slight
bourbon
notes
the
beer
has
some
bourbon
notes
bannana
very
light
clove
lingering
finish
the
body
and
carbonation
are
medium
no
noticeable
alcohol
imo
a
dissapointment
there
are
much
better
wheatwines
available
for
a
lesser
price
white
oak
is
a
pretty
impressive
beer
i
was
skeptical
for
such
a
big
beer
it
is
rather
mild
mannered
and
is
definitely
tasty
perhaps
three
years
has
taken
some
of
the
edge
off
tough
to
say
its
good
stuff
the
nose
needs
work
but
it
performs
well
in
all
other
respects
easy
recommendation
d
more
of
a
tripel
than
a
wheat
wine
to
my
taste
but
it
works
well
with
the
subtle
barrel
character
overall
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
which
is
very
well
hidden
the
degree
of
carbonation
probably
helps
this
is
an
awesome
beer
smelling
it
i
thought
oh
crap
this
is
just
gonna
be
a
shitty
wheat
ale
and
i
hate
wheat
ales
but
the
taste
is
soooo
different
the
bourbon
barrel
dominates
in
such
an
awesome
way
id
drink
this
every
day
overall
a
good
beer
for
certain
occasions
would
make
a
great
winter
warmer
very
complex
with
touches
of
sweetslightl
sour
and
woody
notes
will
definitely
cellar
one
and
see
how
it
ages
poured
into
an
overized
wine
glass
a
hazed
orange
infused
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
atop
alot
of
hot
booze
in
the
nose
along
with
heavy
yeast
esterslingering
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
spiced
pears
really
hot
at
firstit
took
a
few
swallows
for
it
to
tone
down
enough
for
mevanilla
and
alot
of
yeasty
notesfaint
drying
and
toasted
oak
in
the
finish
a
little
hot
for
my
likingit
has
some
rich
flavors
but
they
are
masked
a
little
by
the
yeast
and
big
alcohol
in
my
opinion
o
tastes
a
little
hot
but
i
though
mischief
was
very
hot
when
i
tried
it
too
complex
flavors
and
drinkable
for
a
11

bottle
poured

with
a
large

pretty
boozy
with
distinct
notes
of
bourbon
and
some
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
taste
is
a
pretty
complex
mix
of
light
fruity
ester
with
some
dominant
bourbon
notes
with
some
woody
notes
and
light
bubblegum
notes
body
is
pretty
full
with
good
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
apparent
interesting
exercise
with
good
idea
of
blending
different
beers
but
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
bourbon
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
nose
is
deceiving
this
is
a
bourbon
forward
beer
the
underlying
beer
is
good
but
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
huge
woody
earthy
bourbon
flavors
it
is
a
complex
beer
but
the
overall
product
needs
balance
in
the
end
it
is
a
bit
unique
so
in
my
book
its
worth
trying
o
an
interesting
experience
for
sure
a
wellmade
beer
that
is
extremely
complex
but
not
something
ill
come
running
back
to
especially
with
a
price
tag
near
20
nothing
like

lighter
papaya
and
some
molasses
sneaks
in
for
good
measure
a
light
booziness
provides
a
bit
of
alcoholic
heat
enough
to
allow
you
to
feel
it
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
the
surrounding
tastiness
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
damn
fine
wheatwine
the
best
ive
had
from
the
style
in
an
awfully
long
time
full
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
chewy
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
this
beer
definitely
excels
when
it
rises
toward
room
temperature
but
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
benchmark
that
many
of
the
other
barrelaged
bruery
beers
have
set
o
this
is
very
drinkable
for
its
strength
not
mindblowing
but
somewhat
tasty
definitely
the
best
wheatwine
ive
ever
had
this
is
so
complex
and
different
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
almost
white
color
with
a
playful
head
a
couple
inches
tall
and
bone
white
the
nose
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
bourbon
but
theres
a
lot
of
funky
yeast
new
fresh
oak
and
hefty
wheat
malts
oh
yeah
and
plenty
of
booze
the
flavor
is
great
wildly
complex
starchy
oak
notes
first
sappy
but
not
sweet
like
a
freshly
milled
tree
not
some
old
decaying
barrel
the
what
malt
is
strong
for
its
color
really
robust
biscuity
notes
and
some
vanilla
from
the
bourbon
in
the
finish
the
booze
doesnt
taste
as
strong
is
it
smells
but
boy
can
you
feel
it
one
bottle
of
this
is
goodnight
mouthfeel
is
great
vibrant
carbonation
and
a
little
acidity
in
the
mouth
almost
has
the
feel
of
a
sour
but
it
isnt
the
body
is
medium
lighter
than
other
wheatwines
ive
had
its
scary
drinkable
and
easy
to
do
because
theres
so
much
going
on
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
this
month
a
fine
wheatwine
particularly
as
it
warms
and
the
overdone
carbonation
fades
im
pretty
sure
my
second
bottle
is
going
to
be
awesome
in
another
year
or
so
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
amber
accents
capped
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
foamy
head
very
good
retention
limited
amount
of
splotchy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
toasted
coconut
vanilla
and
a
very
understated
hint
of
oak
on
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
nose
initially
coconut
and
vanilla
are
both
present
joined
by
mild
hints
of
ripe
fruit
and
caramel
finishes
crisp
clean
and
dry
with
a
very
mild
hint
of
oaky
bourbon
and
medicinal
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
fairly
effervescent
carbonation
there
was
a
lot
about
this
brew
that
was
unexpected
including
its
lighter
body
also
there
was
little
overt
evdience
of
barrel
aging
as
it
is
much
more
subtle
the
crispness
of
the
finish
was
very
pleasing
along
with
many
other
subtle
complexities
m
medium
leading
to
full
big
i
really
expected
this
to
be
darker
and
take
on
some
kind
of
chocolate
or
toffee
character
but
this
beer
stays
pretty
true
to
its
wheat
roots
however
the
bourbon
really
overtakes
it
at
times
pretty
easy
drinking
for
11
5
wowza
big
brash
and
boozy
i
dont
know
if
i
would
cellar
it
though
because
the
hops
are
still
shining
through
quite
brightly
maybe
so
mid
bodied
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
quite
creamy
alcohol
shows
with
a
heavy
warmth
could
be
much
better
hidden
barrel
aging
is
extreamely
subtle
certainly
a
descent
enough
beer
but
another
bruery
beer
i
wouldnt
bother
with
again
especially
at
the
price
point

d
i
am
a
bit
surprised
how
much
i
like
this
considering
i
think
mischief
sucks
balls
still
i
cant
help
but
think
the
wheatwine
itself
is
probably
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
i
guess
i
can
find
out
somewhat
when
i
get
my
white
chocolates
in
any
case
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
750

2012
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
couple
inch
offwhite
head
the
head
stayed
around
a
while
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
it
smells
like
oak
vanilla
coconut
bourbon
bready
malt
and
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
and
banana
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
brew
tastes
like
caramel
oak
vanilla
bourbon
citrus
peel
peppery
spice
and
a
bit
of
pear
the
bourbon
is
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
up
more
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
sticky
and
coating
and
is
well
carbonated
for
an

i
thought
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
id
buy
it
again
17

a
bottle
d
a
bit
boozy
and
heavy
on
the
whiskeyoak
aspect
o
not
really
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
it
does
have
some
good
things
going
on
including
a
pretty
good
flavor
o
wow
im
a
huge
bruery
fan
but
this
is
by
far
the
most
displeasing
entry
ive
had
from
them
ive
had
good
wheatwines
before
too
smuttynose
does
a
good
one
for
example
hopefully
this
is
one
that
absolutely
needs
to
be
cellared
because
otherwise
its
just
a
hot
mess
tart
up
front
getting
smoother
late
warming
throughout
fullbodied
good
though
the
aged
part
doesnt
really
seem
to
be
too
prevalent
the
oak
is
nice
not
overpowering
like
is
some
beers
but
a
solid
partner
to
the
other
flavors
very
nice
overall
and
certainly
better
after
it
warms
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
belgian
yeast
complements
the
base
beer
nicely
a
little
too
all
around
boozy
and
got
sweet
at
times
but
a
solid
beer
i
love
wheatwines
but
they
tend
to
be
on
two
ends
of
a
fault
line
delicious
or
bland
with
little
in
between
this
one
unfortunately
leans
towards
the
latter
odd
to
wish
a
bruery
beer
was
more
extreme
but
well
i
do
pretty
good
slightly
above
medium
bodied
with
a
lively
sharp
carbonation
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
its
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
liking
but
the
nose
is
nice
and
the
flavor
transitions
work
well
solid
beer
id
drink
this
again
overall
a
solid
barrelaged
wheatwine
a
little
heavyhanded
w
the
bourbon
though
and
i
still
prefer
harvest
dance
and
not
only
because
it
costs
half
as
much
overall
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
barrel
presence
that
i
really
enjoy
why
am
i
feeling
pretty
buzzed
after
drinking
the
majority
of
this
bottle
over
multiple
hours
oh
yea
its
11
5
its
becoming
a
bit
much
to
finish
this
bottle
off
by
myself
and
the
alcohol
content
is
becoming
a
bit
more
apparent
the
further
i
get
into
the
bottle
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
overall
a
nice
big
beer
with
a
great
barrel
presence
that
doesnt
go
too
overboard
the
high
abv
and
large
format
detracts
slightly
here
barely
energetic
pour
fills
half
the
glass
with
wispy
offwhite
foam
luckily
it
is
so
airy
and
whipped
up
that
it
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thin
if
consistent
surface
coating
as
might
be
expected
not
much
stick
in
the
lacing
what
might
be
there
supercloudy
orange
which
lightens
at
the
outer
edges
even
given
its
opacity
you
can
see
a
maelstrom
of
bubbles
whipping
around
inside
the
glass
has
a
relaxed
feel
about
it
the
nose
displays
an
initial
burst
of
wheat
and
then
lemongrass
follows
up
with
honey
vanilla
bean
caramel
grape
skins
and
some
coal
and
earth
gives
up
a
bushel
of
peach
apricot
pear
fruit
scents
with
a
little
mixed
sweet
citrus
on
top
overall
most
notable
for
its
restraint
even
as
it
openly
offers
the
benefits
of
the
barrel
aging
fullbodied
sweet
yet
with
a
sour
side
as
well
here
banana
and
bubblegum
comes
through
along
with
wheatgerm
mild
sous
bois
and
then
that
honey
and
lees
the
orange
peel
is
clearer
hint
of
a
poached
fruit
character
to
the
peach
apricot
pear
pineapple
and
apple
fruit
it
is
damn
foamy
the
increasing
dryness
through
the
finish
helps
temper
this
interesting
for
how
you
sense
its
complexity
but
cant
quite
tease
them
apart
the
oak
influence
is
moderate
and
not
dominant
creaminess
helps
it
hug
the
palate
and
last
longer
othis
is
an
intense
beer
that
i
recommend
you
share
its
another
beautiful
beer
from
the
bruery
its
unique
and
complex
but
its
slightly
more
serious
and
strong
than
most
other
bruery
beers
ive
had
it
is
the
best
wheat
wine
ive
had
overall
a
great
big
beer
lots
of
flavor
complex
and
unique
the
coconut
flavor
is
really
good
as
is
the
floral
fruits
this
is
a
intense
drink
something
id
drink
on
occassion
not
all
the
time
worth
a
drink
for
sure
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
wheat
in
it
as
well
as
some
pepper
and
bubblegum
notes
the
flavor
is
similar
but
more
complex
i
get
a
lot
of
wheat
as
well
as
a
big
dose
of
alcohol
up
front
i
also
get
some
pepper
notes
as
well
as
a
very
light
amount
of
whiskey
and
some
belgian
yeast
the
oak
is
very
strong
in
the
beer
and
really
is
what
this
beer
is
all
about
which
i
guess
you
can
expect
given
the
beers
name
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
big
white
head
sits
atop
a
slightly
opaque
orange
body
smell
is
sweet
hints
of
coconut
and
spice
the
taste
is
really
well
balanced
citrus
noticeable
wheat
spice
and
yeast
the
oak
yields
some
coconut
and
vanilla
very
nice
fit
this
is
a
great
blend
of
beers
here
if
youve
had
mischief
in
the
past
youll
notice
that
as
well
glad
i
grabbed
2
of
these
looking
to
save
the
other
for
cooler
weather
o
interesting
experiment
i
cant
say
it
blew
me
away
but
it
was
definitely
above
average
the
bourbon
didnt
take
the
beer
over
but
simply
imparted
some
really
nice
characteristics
to
an
already
interesting
style
i
like
many
of
the
bruerys
barrel
treatments
even
more
than
this
but
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
i
would
rather
drink
curieux
i
think
instead
o
i
was
surprised
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
wheatwine
is
a
style
that
is
very
underrepresented
in
my
opinion
its
nice
to
find
one
thats
not
too
expensive
easy
to
find
and
quite
delicious
complex
and
mellow
may
or
may
not
be
worth
the
price
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
just
leaves
a
thin
white
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
boozy
and
sweet
lots
of
grainy
aromas
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
had
a
nice
amount
of
wheat
flavors
upfront
it
fades
into
a
slight
bitterness
that
finishes
with
a
subtle
sweetness
from
the
barrel
aging
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
its
got
a
low
carbonation
to
it
its
not
overly
heavy
for
the
abv
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
brew
id
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
o
this
bottle
wasnt
cheap
so
i
dont
know
how
many
more
i
will
pick
up
but
i
was
very
happy
to
have
tried
one
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
full
mouthfeel
this
is
a
slow
sipper
this
one
isnt
bad
but
the
barrel
flavors
seem
compromised
and
the
wheatwine
flavors
are
a
bit
harsh
at
times
keeping
this
from
being
really
great
this
one
is
pretty
solid
really
enjoyable
from
bruery
provisions
in
orange
ca
white
oak
good
christ
citrus
caramel
bourbon
vanilla
belgian
yeast
spice
green
peppercorn
and
tropical
fruit
notes
highlighted
with
papaya
medium
full
bodied
peaches
resounding
and
reminding
me
of
southern
comfort
in
a
way
some
heat
of
abv
is
evident
but
enjoyable
under
the
circumstances
a
sipper
to
enjoy
after
dinner
in
their
words
oakeydokey
white
oak
pours
a
lighter
bodied
slightly
cloudy
honey
gold
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
head
the
nose
is
odd
a
lot
of
slicing
and
alcohol
with
slight
belgian
yeast
and
chamomile
and
other
herbal
notes
the
flavors
are
odd
its
a
weird
mix
of
belgian
yeast
intense
slicing
alcohol
and
unripe
vegetables
its
almost
a
super
spiced
wheat
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
and
fresh
green
veggies
i
cant
get
behind
it
its
awkward
its
boozy
its
just
not
well
integrated
and
is
pretty
disjointed
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
cant
like
from
the
bruery
o
very
enjoyable
and
an
interesting
blend
of
styles
that
make
up
this
beer
i
think
bourbon
barrel
aging
added
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
the
contribution
of
coconut
was
unique
definitely
one
to
try
again
o
this
beer
is
an
interesting
mix
of
beers
half
wheatwhine
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
half
mischief
the
beer
is
good
but
not
something
id
pay
16
for
again
honestly
worth
a
try
md
medium
bodied
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
it
sort
of
has
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
to
it
and
that
detracts
a
little
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
spruce
ale
i
brewed
i
like
it
not
sure
id
go
for
another
bottle
on
my
own
though
poured
from
a
750
very
frothy
head
with
golden
color
and
dense
carbonation
smell
was
mostly
of
bourbon
barrel
with
some
vanilla
taset
was
heavy
on
the
bourbob
not
my
favorite
also
sweet
and
fairly
alcoholic
this
should
be
served
in
2
or
4
oz
size
for
me
as
thats
plenty
not
a
refreshing
or
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
was
fine
but
the
taste
missed
for
me
o
the
first
wheat
wine
ive
ever
had
and
really
an
enjoyable
one
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
high
abv
beers
ive
had
bourbon
goodness
in
a
lighter
colored
beer
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
wheatwines
but
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
by
far
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
overall
this
is
a
sweet
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
and
that
big
abv
would
throw
your
thoughts
straight
to
the
hopper
if
you
drink
too
much
and
try
to
think
about
it
moderation
is
certainly
key
with
this
bad
boy
but
ill
say
i
again
the
bruery
has
certainly
come
though
i
love
my
ales
as
much
as
i
love
my
belgians
and
i
have
to
say
this
has
been
a
good
competitor
on
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
a
great
experience
for
me
i
made
a
trade
with
my
friend
for
this
bottle
i
would
advise
anyone
who
has
a
limited
chance
at
getting
their
hands
on
a
year
aged
bottle
to
go
for
it
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
a
decent
sipper
that
seems
like
something
is
going
on
with
it
not
really
what
i
expected
for
a
barrel
aged
wheatwine
but
wasnt
horrible
either
o
my
first
bourbonbarrel
wheatwine
its
not
too
bad
i
feel
like
the
bourbon
doesnt
really
work
with
the
wheatwine
though
just
not
complimentary
flavors
its
decent
enough
and
drinkable
and
unique
but
it
really
didnt
suit
my
style
o
i
really
tried
to
get
into
this
one
the
bruery
is
one
of
my
favs
especially
when
it
comes
to
sours
and
over
the
top
extreme
imp
stouts
aged
in
barrels
however
the
yeast
flavors
and
the
high
carbonation
kinda
ruined
it
for
me
maybe
im
a
year
or
so
when
the
whole
thing
mellows
out
the
barrel
character
will
shine
more
and
the
yeast
and
carbonation
might
calm
down
a
bit
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
really
stands
out
it
felt
over
carbonated
over
spiced
and
lacked
much
barrel
presence
for
being
partially
barrel
aged
gotta
admit
im
a
little
let
down
by
this
one
wheatwines
are
good
barrelaged
wheatwines
even
better
but
white
oak
is
just
too
solvent
and
lacks
the
creamy
body
i
expect
from
the
style
too
bad
an
enjoyable
beer
but
the
booze
really
dominates
at
times
once
it
cools
off
i
think
this
will
improve
greatly
o
what
a
train
wreck
of
a
beer
this
isnt
anywhere
close
to
good
it
feels
lazy
and
uninspired
and
it
disappoints
in
most
every
facet
do
your
palate
a
favor
and
introduce
mr
white
oak
to
ms
drain
pronto
o
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
each
time
you
put
it
to
your
lips
you
taste
something
a
little
different
from
the
last
sip
very
interesting
indeed
o
this
was
not
what
i
expected
but
still
very
good
i
am
very
interested
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
this
is
a
pretty
complex
beer
but
surprisingly
it
didnt
wow
me
it
has
a
heck
of
a
lot
going
on
broad
and
deep
but
nothing
that
captivated
me
loads
of
strong
solid
flavors
pretty
good
wheatwine
strong
alcoholic
notes
but
that
get
tempered
by
some
fruit
juice
notes
and
some
wheat
notes
as
well
at
11
5
this
is
boozy
but
not
burning
pretty
good
beer
may
go
well
with
a
salad
up
front
this
beer
is
tasty
very
tasty
just
want
less
carbonation
is
all
overall
too
much
alcohol
not
really
that
complex
or
enjoyable
a
bunch
of
different
flavor
notes
but
none
of
them
excellent
carbonation
is
too
sharp
d
undoubtedly
the
strangest
beer
ive
had
from
the
bruery
yet
there
are
a
lot
of
different
elements
within
the
aroma
and
taste
but
i
find
them
to
clash
rather
the
meldblend
ultimately
that
makes
this
pretty
poor
for
drinkability
imo
d
overall
meh
not
what
i
expected
way
too
much
booze
and
carb
feels
thin
its
like
they
made
a
belgian
tripel
strong
ale
and
tried
to
do
a
bunch
of
things
with
it
that
didnt
pan
out
well
and
just
got
way
too
boozy
and
carbonated
and
where
the
hell
is
the
bourbon
where
they
fifteenth
fill
barrels
o
overall
what
the
heck
did
i
buy
its
such
a
jumble
of
flavours
and
is
all
kinda
thin
and
faint
had
such
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
it
was
dashed
wonderfully
by
a
crummy
flavour
argh
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
bone
white
head
and
a
steady
stream
of
carb
bubbles
rising
from
the
depths
smells
of
spicy
wheat
yeasty
phenols
a
bit
of
oak
and
bourbon
with
a
hint
of
fruity
sour
sweetness
this
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
dark
fruity
sugary
sweetness
up
front
lots
of
berries
and
caramel
followed
by
a
bit
of
barrel
oak
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
theres
a
spicy
earthy
sweetness
that
turns
into
a
long
lingering
heat
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
sugary
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
one
but
the
carbonation
might
be
a
bit
high
and
the
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
too
present
too
bad
i
dont
have
another
of
these
as
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
ages
well
who
knew
that
this
was
distributed
in
my
area
probably
a
lot
of
people
but
now
me
completely
opaque
and
hazy
bright
golden
yellow
in
color
with
sligh
orange
highlights
one
finger
lightly
dense
head
with
just
ok
retention
aroma
is
chock
full
of
coconut
and
big
on
raw
oak
some
vanilla
and
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
a
hint
of
solventy
alcohol
but
the
aforementioned
flavors
are
the
main
players
the
flavor
is
big
on
fresh
cut
oak
and
coconut
some
vanilla
along
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
there
is
a
distinct
tropical
nature
to
this
beer
pretty
abundent
alcohol
flavor
on
the
back
end
pretty
huge
body
thick
full
and
round
i
love
the
bruery
and
seek
there
beers
out
when
possible
so
i
was
really
happy
to
have
this
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
to
much
alcohol
and
could
use
some
additional
blending
so
smooth
out
the
divergent
flavors
o
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
nice
taste
notes
and
depth
really
drinks
incredibly
well
for
an
11
5
number
on
it
quite
happy
with
this
offering
from
the
bruery
doa
appearance
is
a
cloudy
yellow
tone
with
a
short
white
head
its
nose
has
vanilla
oak
and
coconut
a
very
interesting
smell
complex
to
be
sure
the
taste
contains
orange
wheat
more
of
the
oak
and
a
strong
punch
of
bourbon
mmm
sip
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medfull
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
the
abv
here
is
not
wellmasked
but
that
is
fine
by
me
i
very
much
enjoyed
white
oak
and
had
been
looking
out
for
it
for
me
it
did
not
disappoint
flavor
could
stand
to
be
more
aggressive
and
forward
but
overall
a
very
nice
and
well
thought
out
brew
another
great
offering
from
famille
rue
recommended
and
worth
some
hype
but
over
priced
at
18750ml
i
have
two
more
and
cant
wait
to
report
back
once
some
age
has
been
put
on
them
o
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
something
awesome
like
nemesis
2009
but
apparently
blending
this
with
mischief
has
turned
this
into
a
belgian
farmhouse
beer
instead
of
a
wheatwine
i
would
love
to
try
the
pure
barrel
aged
version
of
white
sap
as
i
feel
it
could
be
more
of
what
i
am
looking
for
poured
from
aprox
22
oz
bottle
into
tulip
shaped
pint
glass
nice
initial
head
but
soon
disapates
with
no
lacing
reminds
me
of
an
oak
aged
saisonfarmhouse
ale
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
would
have
bet
it
was
brewed
ommegang
brewery
which
in
my
opinion
is
a
huge
compliment
ommegang
rules
a
little
pricey
16
99
but
i
would
buy
this
again
on
occasion
very
good
stuff
but
very
little
bourbon
character
a
little
hot
11
5
abv
but
i
like
that
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
light
bourbon
smell
and
no
sediment
the
beer
has
a
light
sweet
taste
that
carries
the
bourbon
well
its
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
but
doesnt
wow
me
in
he
end
i
would
say
for
notes
of
bourbon
for
someone
thats
not
used
to
ba
beers
this
may
change
their
ways
the
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
is
quite
refreshing
as
well
and
makes
this
beer
a
winner
white
oak
pours
a
hazy
slightly
dull
tangerine
more
than
three
fingers
of
white
foam
coalesce
atop
the
beer
and
the
head
displays
very
good
retention
lacing
is
fairly
spotty
though
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
though
nothings
there
that
i
would
call
a
focus
or
centerpiece
notes
of
coconut
bourbon
oak
fruity
booziness
and
vanilla
all
blend
together
without
anything
establishing
itself
as
the
primary
aroma
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
bit
more
boozy
with
the
alcohol
soaked
fruit
and
bourbon
notes
taking
over
somewhat
and
any
coconut
from
the
nose
being
lost
the
body
is
surprisingly
light
for
more
than
an
11
beer
and
its
paired
with
an
overactive
carbonation
that
leaves
the
beer
coming
across
as
way
too
effervescent
for
what
should
be
a
malt
driven
beer
white
oak
is
an
alright
tasting
beer
that
doesnt
rank
as
one
of
the
bruerys
best
offerings
2012
vintage
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
oily
wisps
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
very
grainy
and
fruity
with
some
woody
aromas
taste
is
of
grain
fruits
wood
and
subtle
bourbon
flavors
there
is
a
slight
tartness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
barrel
aging
is
very
subtle
and
comes
out
more
in
the
aftertaste
2012
vintage
pours
a
very
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
goes
down
rather
slowly
pours
very
nicely
scent
is
initially
hoppy
with
some
belgian
yeast
aromas
sweet
coconut
with
spicy
aromas
very
unique
nose
on
this
one
vanilla
and
oak
make
their
way
to
the
nostrils
the
oak
is
quite
pleasant
as
it
warms
lots
of
citrus
as
well
orange
peel
lemon
etc
subtle
bourbon
quite
the
complex
smelling
brew
we
have
here
taste
initially
remind
me
of
mischief
you
get
that
bold
spicy
hoppy
bright
citrus
flavor
but
then
it
smoothly
transforms
to
oaky
coconut
and
caramel
flavors
sweet
vanilla
and
bourbon
wow
just
phenomenal
flavors
here
finishes
with
a
bit
more
citrus
somewhat
bitter
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
very
high
as
i
cannot
believe
this
is
11
5
overall
such
an
amazing
beer
i
bought
my
full
allocation
of
5
bottles
i
will
gladly
buy
5
more
if
i
get
the
chance
to
head
to
orange
before
it
is
sold
out
overall
this
was
a
really
great
unique
great
beer
the
flavor
profile
reminds
me
a
lot
how
the
cascade
bourbonic
plague
beer
progressed
as
you
drank
it
started
off
with
predominant
light
fruitiness
bordering
sourness
then
as
it
warms
you
get
a
nice
oak
and
light
bourbon
presence
the
50
barrel
aging
was
perfect
for
this
because
there
arent
many
or
any
that
can
hold
up
to
the
complete
bourbon
barrel
treatment
not
sure
what
this
was
like
fresh
but
it
is
perfect
right
now
kinda
wished
i
saved
this
for
slightly
warmer
weather
but
i
was
too
anxious
to
try
it
definitely
the
best
wheat
wines
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
i
heard
theres
a
new
batch
coming
out
this
year
2012
so
definitely
seek
it
out
then
as
it
is
probably
quite
hard
to
come
by
now
as
far
as
any
fruit
flavors
theyd
have
to
be
light
skinned
type
of
fruit
im
talking
pear
lemon
white
grapes
type
of
stuff
o
its
great
after
2
years
of
cellaring
i
want
more
d
this
would
be
alright
if
it
was
solid
in
6oz
nip
bottles
and
split
two
ways
pretty
tough
to
drink
more
than
a
few
ounces
o
different
but
i
really
loved
this
one
i
would
go
for
this
one
again
overall
as
the
temerature
increases
the
burbonycaramel
flavors
inceras
with
the
caramel
apply
flavors
taking
a
back
seat
overall
a
very
satisfying
beer
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
subtle
sweet
alcohol
mango
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
fruit
and
mango
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
one
was
a
little
out
of
place
with
the
other
44
brews
that
were
cracked
open
as
they
were
all
sours
except
for
one
or
two
others
this
was
a
nice
palate
refresher
and
definitely
was
quite
well
received
with
the
group
the
fruit
aspect
going
on
here
was
quite
nice
and
seemed
to
work
well
with
the
woody
character
i
picked
up
on
the
aroma
let
you
know
this
one
was
going
to
be
a
heavy
hitter
but
there
was
no
sign
of
this
in
the
flavor
at
all
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
drink
this
was
very
unique
with
the
flavor
profile
i
am
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
it
struck
me
as
a
beer
that
could
go
underappreciated
overall
is
amazing
and
im
really
excited
to
have
got
to
try
this
beer
id
recommend
this
one
around
the
holiday
but
on
a
warm
spring
day
it
didnt
hit
the
spot
for
me
there
are
so
many
other
great
beers
from
this
brewery
that
i
will
likely
not
seek
this
out
again
but
i
commend
them
for
producing
this
one
o
i
dont
think
ive
had
this
particular
combination
of
flavors
before
i
liked
it
but
the
flavors
were
a
bit
disjointed
and
i
think
another
six
months
may
help
them
to
meld
together
more
o
a
bit
too
strong
in
the
booze
department
for
me
interesting
beer
but
not
something
id
care
to
drink
a
lot
of
medium
bodied
with
very
tight
carbonation
up
front
that
is
immediately
countered
by
a
blast
of
bourbon
and
burnt
wood
that
overpower
almost
everything
and
lingers
throughout
into
a
very
hot
burning
finish
the
barrel
character
is
way
too
strong
in
this
beer
creating
an
overly
hot
boozy
astringent
mess
lots
of
earthy
oak
and
hot
bourbon
flavor
with
a
decent
bit
of
vanilla
flavor
that
surprisingly
doesnt
mellow
things
out
much
at
all
underneath
all
of
the
heat
there
is
a
slightly
creamy
presence
with
hints
of
crisp
light
fruit
and
zesty
peppery
spice
this
beer
is
not
very
well
balanced
and
is
kind
of
an
abrasive
assault
on
the
palate
it
doesnt
taste
very
good
and
is
tough
to
choke
down
it
improves
a
bit
as
it
warms
but
it
is
still
a
one
dimensional
failure
d
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
abv
but
was
really
tasty
and
was
digging
the
variation
of
flavors
going
on
glad
i
got
to
grab
another
bottle
of
this
brew
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
its
mildly
dry
on
the
back
end
and
the
forward
is
a
little
sweet
the
midpalate
region
is
mostly
estery
and
bready
its
a
pretty
drinkable
and
decent
beer
pours
a
light
caramel
color
with
a
nice
light
off
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
really
brings
nice
notes
forward
and
i
really
like
the
oak
characteristics
some
light
bread
notes
as
well
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
combine
quite
well
bringing
down
some
really
nice
creamy
oak
as
well
as
light
caramel
and
bread
really
digging
the
mouthfeel
drinks
quite
well
overall
and
was
a
nice
treat
a
unique
and
complex
flavor
profile
going
on
here
oaky
tannic
notes
and
white
grape
are
prominent
up
front
then
some
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
candy
sugar
move
forward
the
11
5
abv
is
present
in
some
sharp
black
pepper
notes
but
no
boozyness
prickly
carbonation
throughout
on
the
taste
boozy
and
spicy
bourbon
assault
the
palate
yet
not
exhibiting
fusel
alcohol
harshness
quite
a
plus
angel
food
cake
and
marshmallow
middle
essentially
after
the
dominating
aspect
of
the
bourbon
is
looked
past
the
malt
body
is
quite
mellow
and
lightly
sweet
finish
is
a
touch
hot
but
more
on
the
pleasant
warming
side
with
a
very
enjoyable
tongue
coating
texture
additionally
it
ends
a
touch
dry
and
tart
robust
with
respect
to
the
bourbon
quality
and
yet
drinkable
solid
surprisingly
drinkable
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
4
5
this
is
a
great
beer
well
done
bruery
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
with
a
high
abv
dont
pass
up
the
chance
to
drink
this
one
d
easily
my
favorite
bruery
beer
to
date
white
oak
incorporates
sweet
woody
and
hoppy
elements
to
create
a
complex
and
flavorful
ale
that
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
an
11
strong
ale
d
i
really
enjoyed
white
oak
from
the
first
vanilla
notes
to
the
last
of
the
bubbles
o
this
is
pretty
tasty
given
the
high
alcohol
one
would
think
that
it
would
be
a
chore
to
go
through
a
bottle
but
ive
gone
through
two
glasses
and
am
looking
forward
to
a
third
hugely
carbonated
pouring
this
one
into
a
snifter
results
in
a
good
34
fingers
of
rocky
white
foam
floating
upon
the
dark
straw
colored
brew
nosing
the
beer
i
get
apricots
tropical
fruits
wheat
vanilla
and
oak
upon
tasting
the
beer
for
the
first
time
i
get
a
very
complex
blend
of
vanilla
oak
caramel
white
pepper
and
soothing
warming
alcohol
an
outstanding
blend
and
a
great
beer
probably
my
favorite
from
the
bruery
so
far
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
fairly
light
it
hides
its
alcohol
pretty
well
tasty
and
delicious
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
style
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
and
become
more
familiar
with
quite
a
unique
beer
i
really
like
what
the
bruery
they
not
only
make
good
beer
but
also
continue
to
push
what
beer
can
be
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
bit
of
warmth
but
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
its
weight
thanks
eric
very
high
carbonation
good
body
with
its
great
crispness
pretty
drinkable
though
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
not
really
bad
in
fact
still
pretty
good
but
with
all
the
bruery
beer
we
had
this
one
was
kinda
meh
for
me
a
bit
of
a
mess
that
perhaps
would
integrate
better
with
some
time
pretty
tasty
thanks
again
eric
i
would
buy
a
few
of
these
if
we
got
them
into
town
but
i
doubt
i
would
open
one
for
at
least
a
year
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
d
takes
a
hit
from
the
noticeable
alcohol
but
still
pretty
drinkable
for
an
11
5
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
it
is
very
interesting
for
the
style
it
is
drinkable
but
going
down
slower
than
some
i
like
it
this
is
a
great
beer
as
the
light
barrel
notes
make
this
one
unique
and
very
enjoyable
thanks
ben
for
breaking
this
one
out
d
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
pale
ale
i
thought
the
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
combined
for
a
great
smell
and
taste
would
definitely
have
again
d
pretty
good
solid
beer
d
considering
the
abv
pretty
darned
drinkable
d
drinkability
is
solid
given
the
abv
feel
is
light
as
should
be
expected
for
a
wheat
ale
with
belgian
yeast
highly
carbonated
light
mouthfeel
i
didnt
have
much
hope
for
this
before
i
tried
but
after
im
floored
this
beer
is
complex
totally
drinkable
and
very
unique
get
a
hold
of
this
if
you
can
d
very
nice
flavors
in
this
beer
i
finished
the
bottle
and
enjoyed
all
of
it
swirl
in
glass
to
release
some
of
the
extra
carbonation
it
helps
gonna
have
to
go
buy
some
more
of
this
and
let
it
sit
for
a
year
and
try
again
d
this
one
is
very
memorable
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
come
back
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
as
it
defies
categorization
a
capped
750ml
bottle
much
thanks
to
mymrnngjckt
for
sharing
this
treat
at
a
recent
tasting
the
bottle
was
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
snifter
the
ale
appears
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
fluffy
white
head
the
head
produces
a
slight
lace
with
each
sip
the
flavors
and
aromas
consist
of
oak
vanilla
nutty
sweet
caramelized
grains
toasted
coconut
wheat
bread
fruity
yeast
medium
to
full
bodied
for
a
bspa
and
adequately
carbonated
as
well
thanks
again
for
sharing
this
one
kevin
tasty
stuff
75cl
bottle
thanks
to
sandstone
hazy
orange
with
a
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
like
a
lemon
meringue
pie
with
a
ton
of
vanilla
very
crusty
with
a
buttery
flaky
crust
the
flavor
has
the
same
lemonvanilla
pie
quality
with
some
oak
and
caramel
sweetness
low
on
the
hops
with
the
sweetness
carrying
through
the
finish
full
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
almost
a
little
too
sweet
but
very
unique
and
complex
flavors
i
feel
bad
giving
a
poor
review
to
such
a
revered
brewery
but
this
one
was
unpalatable
to
me
oh
baby
bring
me
more
of
this
one
the
abv
is
well
integrated
and
while
not
invisible
you
can
easily
make
the
mistake
of
drinking
this
one
too
quickly
drinkability
is
very
high
for
the
style
and
abv
d
strong
sweet
flavors
and
alcohol
but
still
smooth
and
delicious
it
seems
the
wheat
portion
really
smooths
things
out
a
bit
bottle
courtesy
sandstone
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
with
a
fading
tan
head
aroma
is
scotchlike
both
in
character
and
in
alcohol
strong
estery
notes
with
pear
and
stone
fruit
some
vanillahoney
flavor
is
delicious
but
very
sweet
honey
candied
citrus
vanilla
maybe
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
not
to
mention
bourbon
rich
but
still
hot
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
taste
follows
the
aroma
the
alcohol
is
definitely
apparent
but
not
necessarily
intrusive
at
first
i
thought
it
was
over
carbonated
despite
the
appearance
but
as
time
went
on
i
realized
how
much
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
helps
lift
some
of
the
heaviness
of
the
barrel
character
and
alcohol
a
very
robust
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
but
a
7oz
serving
or
so
was
plenty
satisfying
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
one
ages
d
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
very
good
way
this
was
a
nice
treat
to
enjoy
this
is
an
excellent
brew
with
complex
flavors
that
evolve
making
one
sip
invite
another
a
great
beer
to
curl
up
with
for
an
evening
or
to
share
as
an
after
dinner
drink
d
interesting
to
try
i
wonder
what
time
will
do
to
it
next
time
i
open
one
i
will
definitely
let
it
sit
and
open
up
a
bit
first
decent
but
not
my
fave
bruery
beer
interesting
but
not
entirely
enjoyable
thanks
very
much
to
stevemcqueenjr
for
carrying
this
one
crosscountry
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
half
inch
frothy
bright
white
head
that
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
skim
some
strands
of
lacing
are
revealed
but
weak
legs
nose
expresses
white
grapes
cotton
candy
toasted
oak
vanilla
and
ethanol
taste
reveals
coconut
citrus
whiskey
vanilla
and
buttery
notes
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
a
little
too
high
in
terms
of
carbonation
but
eases
up
as
it
dissipates
amazing
complexity
to
this
beer
with
a
fairly
wellhidden
abv
id
love
to
see
what
some
time
in
the
cellar
would
do
to
this
beer
over
time
i
think
this
beer
is
too
carbonated
the
drinkability
isnt
terrible
but
i
can
already
tell
you
its
going
to
be
a
long
nights
work
polishing
off
this
750ml
bottle
myself
halvsies
would
have
been
perfect
brought
to
the
table
in
a
tulip
i
nice
golden
color
and
white
fluffy
head
the
smell
is
wonderful
it
has
a
nice
bourbon
and
caramel
sweetness
with
little
hints
vanilla
and
clove
and
a
little
bit
if
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
lots
of
bourbon
caramel
vanilla
and
wheaty
sweetness
it
goes
down
super
smooth
and
finishes
very
clean
and
dry
the
bourbon
plays
very
nice
with
beer
the
bourbon
and
caramel
in
this
beer
are
awesome
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
it
coats
my
month
very
nice
medium
bodied
and
just
wonderful
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
bad
this
came
out
underneath
the
huge
hype
shadow
that
was
black
tuesday
but
that
leaves
more
for
me
delicious
really
but
definitely
one
for
contemplation
if
not
dessert
if
you
are
a
fan
of
bourbon
or
single
malt
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
if
not
then
stay
far
far
away
if
i
werent
rating
for
style
i
might
increase
my
score
d
lots
of
strong
tastes
here
but
its
very
heavy
on
the
palate
and
the
finish
is
challenging
im
not
sure
barrelaging
was
a
good
idea
for
this
one
also
i
really
should
have
split
this
with
people
i
was
unable
to
finish
the
bottle
and
poured
out
about
40
of
it
gah
i
hate
throwing
away
expensive
beer
this
is
a
big
beer
with
tons
of
flavors
and
a
seriously
sweet
character
overall
despite
that
and
the
high
abv
it
remains
exceptionally
drinkable
really
well
done
the
taste
opens
with
apricot
and
melonlike
sweetness
honey
pepper
and
clove
carbonation
is
very
high
reminiscent
of
beers
like
duvel
again
i
dont
pick
up
much
bourbon
barrel
character
the
finish
is
semidry
woody
peppery
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
dont
think
its
the
most
harmonious
blend
a
barrelaged
wheatwine
sounds
great
on
its
own
but
it
seems
like
it
lost
some
complexity
and
body
in
the
blend
taken
as
a
belgian
golden
ale
this
beer
is
too
sweet
and
heavy
these
beers
were
probably
best
left
separate
drinkability
is
a
bit
shaky
just
too
high
of
an
abv
and
too
much
booziness
to
really
make
me
want
more
than
812
oz
at
a
time
the
750
ml
bottle
really
should
be
split
3
ways
bottom
line
is
this
beer
has
some
potential
for
improvement
through
maturity
but
is
a
bit
rough
at
this
point
overall
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
enjoyable
blends
i
have
had
it
quite
some
time
i
would
have
no
trouble
at
all
with
splitting
this
one
with
some
family
and
friends
again
any
day
really
a
remarkable
style
they
are
going
for
here
i
shared
this
bottle
with
my
sisterwho
is
becoming
quite
a
beer
advocate
herself
now
and
she
says
this
is
her
favorite
beer
now
id
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
top
favorites
as
well
now
they
are
going
to
go
far
with
all
these
phenomenal
beers
theyre
making
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
too
fairly
thickbodied
verging
on
syrupy
but
it
is
well
balanced
by
ample
carbonation
sweet
syrupy
body
and
high
abv
limit
drinkability
but
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
brew
i
was
told
this
will
be
bottled
in
a
couple
months
i
sure
hope
it
is
and
that
the
bottles
find
their
way
to
denver
all
and
all
i
think
i
have
been
more
impressed
with
this
than
any
other
bruery
beer
other
than
black
tuesday
which
is
made
with
narwhal
horn
the
blood
of
the
last
known
mayans
and
panda
tears
for
those
who
dont
know
this
beer
is
a
barrel
aged
wheatwine
blended
with
mischief
out
of
the
three
beers
that
make
up
melange
3
white
oak
papier
and
black
tuesday
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
however
that
does
not
mean
its
a
bad
beer
on
the
contrary
its
another
wonderful
small
batch
from
the
bruery
that
carves
out
a
nice
niche
among
the
rest
of
their
lineup
one
of
the
few
really
big
brews
that
ive
tried
where
the
tap
pour
and
the
growler
pour
have
been
noticeably
different
still
both
very
nice
and
well
worth
the
try
a
great
effort
and
one
that
i
would
consider
extreme
in
bold
flavors
to
my
liking
the
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
sticky
mouthfeel
this
is
tasty
but
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
wore
on
me
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
but
white
oak
hit
the
spot
on
this
hot
day
its
a
wheat
beer
with
notes
of
vanilla
a
whole
lot
of
sweet
with
a
tinge
of
sour
fruit
very
drinkable
left
me
wanting
more
in
fact
i
want
one
now
tulip
glass
at
the
brewery
on
saturday
after
the
angels
and
yankees
game
this
beer
is
actually

a

this

and
you
can
pretty
much
taste
it
at

it
is
not
heavy
or
too
sweet
which
saves
its
drinkability
will
drink
again

im
glad
i
finally
got

i
loved

to
see
the

of
that
brew
overall
since
i
havent
had

opportunity
to
taste
the
melange

i
would
have
to
say
this

the
best

coming

better

it

ive
had

it
took
me
a

it
was

the
choice

bein
forced

my

a

it
was
tasty
and
savory
but
a
bit
boozy
strong
for
my
liking
a
little
bit
was
enough
for
me
while
it
seemed
like
this
beer
had
some
unintentional
funk
it
was
still
good
this
really
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
delicious
beers
ever
made
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
enjoying
ti
a
few
times
not
but
have
not
gotten
to
write
about
it
here
until
now
its
a
very
special
brew
tasting
quite
a
bit
like
white
chocolate
and
while
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
soured
and
infected
bottles
or
batches
or
whatever
that
has
not
ever
been
my
experience
the
base
beer
is
amazing
but
its
almost
hard
to
imagine
the
wheaty
strong
ale
without
the
bourbon
barrel
and
the
additives
the
bourbon
character
is
immense
here
sweet
vanilla
and
oak
and
booze
in
nose
and
taste
the
addition
of
vanilla
in
the
process
really
picks
up
on
the
component
of
the
bourbon
and
the
vanilla
factor
is
consequently
through
the
roof
the
cocoa
is
raw
and
more
of
a
cacao
butter
type
than
a
chocolate
in
the
traditional
sense
giving
further
credence
the
name
white
chocolate
while
its
obviously
a
very
strong
beer
the
alcohol
never
really
gets
in
the
way
of
the
unique
flavors
which
i
would
say
about
most
of
these
bruery
strong
ales
this
is
one
of
the
more
decadent
and
delicious
ive
ever
had
so
much
vanilla
so
nice
as
it
warms
its
luxurious
and
regal
and
i
am
thankful
to
have
shared
it
with
good
friends
for
me
this
is
the
final
evolution
of
the
style
i
cant
imagine
this
being
improved
in
any
way
thank
god
for
the
heavy
bourbon
it
really
blended
nicely
o
white
chocolate
notes
are
spot
on
drinks
like
a
sweet
barrel
aged
barley
wine
very
good
overall
great
beer
but
i
actually
prefer
white
oak
for
its
drinkability
the
flavor
is
great
in
this
one
but
the
heat
makes
it
tough
to
put
down
pretty
good
but
for
the
price
probably
should
have
been
better
still
i
am
sorry
but
given
the
effort
taken
to
get
this
bottle
i
am
not
going
to
give
a
4
75
score
to
an
infected
beer
when
i
am
expecting
something
else
i
appreciate
the
efforts
of
the
bruery
to
avoid
contamination
by
splitting
their
sours
off
as
bruery
terreux
hopefully
i
can
try
a
noninfected
white
chocolate
soon
couldnt
say
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
it
did
have
a
white
chocolate
taste
in
a
strange
sort
of
way
bourbon
and
yeast
on
the
nose
very
little
carbonation
something
sweet
on
the
pallet
not
really
cocoa
but
maybe
toffee
or
something
like
that
with
a
slight
metallic
edge
that
i
didnt
really
enjoy
overall
a
little
odd
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
might
be
a
different
story
another
high
gravity
offering
there
is
no
mistaking
the
bourbon
presence
in
both
taste
and
aroma
boozy
and
grainy
with
accents
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
thanks
for
the
infected
beer
bruery
it
made
a
great
birthday
beer
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
white
chocolate
maybe
a
couple
years
will
add
some
richness
or
balance
to
it
will
revisit
a
good
wheat
wine
and
the
fact
that
its
bourbon
barrel
aged
helps
obviously
the
only
negative
is
its
advertised
as
white
chocolate
the
bottle
i
got
tasted
nothing
like
white
chocolate
or
vanilla
for
that
matter
the
bruery
has
def
put
out
better
barrel
aged
beers
in
the
past
compared
to
the
2012
batch
this
is
obviously
not
what
the
brewers
intended
but
theres
no
reason
to
send
this
back
ive
had
a
lot
of
intentionally
soured
that
were
far
harder
to
drink
than
this
before
even
seeing
this
bottle
and
knowing
little
about
the
bruery
had
only
tried
the
tart
of
darkness
prior
first
nose
and
sip
i
was
convinced
this
was
a
sour
a
delicious
one
at
that
was
drunk
at
a
bottle
share
so
cant
say
much
about
my
23oz
pour
but
later
found
out
that
this
was
totally
infected
hoping
to
try
it
noninfected
but
would
gladly
buy
this
as
a
sour
this
was
definitely
an
infected
bottle
yet
i
decided
to
review
the
beer
anyway
because
it
turned
out
to
be
well
worth
drinking
the
vanilla
cacao
and
bourbon
treatment
made
for
a
really
interesting
flavour
profile
when
combined
with
the
sourness
from
the
infection
a
happy
accident
every
time
i
have
had
this
it
has
been
a
chore
to
put
away
a
few
ounces
not
something
i
have
ever
remembered
enjoying
non
infected
bottle
or
not
a
poorly
made
beer
o
amazing
drink
this
one
freshish
so
that
the
vanilla
doesnt
fall
off
too
much
overall
the
white
chocolate
concept
is
spot
on
but
the
vanilla
is
as
intense
as
vanilla
extract
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
thecuriograph
com
the
pour
is
a
murky
light
brown
no
visible
head
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
some
nice
film
around
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
huge
with
white
chocolate
flavor
what
a
great
smelling
beer
theres
a
sweet
bourbon
start
on
the
flavor
then
falls
back
to
a
smooth
white
chocolate
and
vanilla
after
taste
you
can
also
pick
up
oak
and
the
alcohol
burn
isnt
overwhelming
its
incredibly
sweet
but
its
so
flavorful
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
carbonated
thought
it
would
be
more
bubbly
from
the
appearance
but
im
glad
its
not
nice
unique
beer
and
a
great
sipper
medium
bodied
fine
cushy
carbonation
sugary
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
levels
goes
down
easy
goes
well
with
pepperidge
farm
brussels
cookies
bottle
poured
a
golden
amber
color
ale
with
a
nice
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
white
chocolate
is
actually
surprising
with
some
residual
sugars
and
some
vanilla
taste
is
also
very
reminiscent
of
white
chocolates
with
some
vanilla
and
quite
a
bit
of
residua
sugars
taste
is
quite
overthetop
so
it
is
probably
best
to
drink
this
in
small
doses
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
with
no
alcohol
being
easily
apparent
interesting
experiment
for
sure
but
not
something
i
would
seek
on
a
regular
basis
pours
clear
and
golden
color
with
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
is
light
but
heavy
on
sweet
malt
caramel
toffee
vanilla
and
hot
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
similar
a
cloying
mix
of
vanilla
caramel
and
overly
sweet
malt
it
has
a
heavy
body
and
minimal
carbonation
making
it
oily
silky
and
thick
overall
an
interesting
brew
that
was
just
to
sweet
and
unbalanced
for
me
served
from
a
2012
bottle
into
a
bruery
tulip
proper
poured
a
vibrant
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
wheat
sweet
alcohol
vanilla
and
cocoa
nibs
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
vanilla
dark
chocolate
wood
milk
chocolate
wheat
earth
spice
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
there
is
a
ton
of
stiff
going
on
in
this
one
the
nose
was
really
quite
nice
and
balanced
almost
like
this
is
just
an
unassuming
beer
for
the
masses
the
flavor
is
the
first
hint
that
something
is
going
on
here
the
booze
on
the
follow
through
confirms
it
this
thing
has
simmered
down
some
in
the
time
before
i
opened
it
granted
this
made
it
really
quite
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
yes
i
just
said
that
at
14
this
was
easy
to
drink
could
i
kill
an
entire
bottle
to
the
face
probably
would
i
recommend
this
to
high
schoolers
to
butt
chug
absolutely
the
less
of
them
there
are
the
better
after
all
definitely
find
a
way
to
get
this
on
your
palate
based
on
the
rumors
from
the
2013
bottles
get
a
2012
based
on
this
you
wont
regret
it
an
interesting
attempt
at
playing
around
with
the
base
beer
overall
a
delicious
beer
in
its
own
right
but
one
that
i
cant
help
wondering
what
it
would
taste
like
without
that
tartness
as
noted
already
the
tart
didnt
ruin
the
beer
by
any
means
but
it
was
hard
not
to
long
to
taste
it
in
all
its
rich
sweet
glory
without
that
tartness
pour
is
a
transparent
dark
amber
with
a
foamy
white
head
nose
is
a
fair
bit
of
bourbon
heavy
wheat
base
and
odd
caramel
malt
muddled
and
dirty
with
a
hint
of
coconut
and
notes
of
milk
chocolate
taste
is
extremely
sweet
and
not
integrated
at
all
the
bourbon
is
lighter
notes
of
apple
juice
and
some
overly
sweet
caramel
the
chocolate
and
nib
notes
are
extremely
out
of
place
and
dont
fit
in
at
all
there
is
tons
of
sugar
hints
of
booziness
through
the
softly
carbonated
finish
the
body
is
big
soft
palate
and
creamy
the
body
has
a
surprising
heft
and
thickness
to
it
and
acidity
plays
an
interesting
feel
in
the
role
as
it
feels
like
sweetness
ought
to
weigh
it
down
the
dryness
that
cuts
in
prevents
that
it
has
a
bite
on
the
tongue
with
every
sip
but
its
pretty
smooth
too
first
beer
of
2013
and
a
big
thanks
to
mexicanskittel
for
sending
over
this
one
to
me
this
was
a
beer
i
was
pretty
excited
to
try
for
a
good
amount
of
time
the
beer
poured
out
as
muddy
looking
gold
or
copper
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
comes
and
goes
very
quickly
no
retention
or
lacing
at
all
in
this
beer
but
i
suppose
its
due
to
the
high
abv
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
strong
its
got
a
lot
of
boozy
ethanol
fumes
as
well
as
vanilla
cocoa
and
bourbon
oak
the
smell
does
resemble
actual
white
chocolate
a
little
bit
the
taste
of
the
beer
at
first
has
some
sour
notes
that
were
a
little
unexpected
from
the
barrel
aging
the
more
i
drank
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
flavors
became
more
intense
which
was
really
impressive
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
boozy
a
little
syrupy
and
had
a
moderate
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
expected
the
beer
to
be
more
along
the
lines
of
a
southern
tier
creme
brulee
or
something
like
that
it
was
much
stronger
than
i
thought
itd
be
as
well
its
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
for
in
my
opinion
still
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
if
the
ale
could
have
finishes
like
it
started
then
the
tart
and
spice
would
have
offered
enough
intrigue
and
complexity
to
fit
right
in
but
because
of
its
misplaced
dryness
and
carbonation
those
spices
and
acidities
are
left
on
an
island
to
fend
for
themselves
something
i
wish
i
could
drink
every
night
but
thats
kind
of
stuff
is
how
you
end
up
on
aes
intervention
the
trick
to
this
beer
is
to
know
your
drinking
a
wheat
wine
and
not
a
white
chocolate
stout
once
you
put
aside
expectation
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
experience
o
very
interesting
brew
i
cant
tell
if
i
like
it
barrel
aging
isnt
super
heavy
but
supplies
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
even
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
isnt
overpowering
the
raisins
really
stand
out
for
me
initially
though
aftertaste
is
a
bit
rough
thats
my
only
real
complaint
very
unique
strong
and
complex
brew
at
the
same
time
never
had
anything
like
this
making
a
beer
that
can
actually
produce
the
flavors
of
white
chocolate
is
an
accomplishment
in
itself
single
finger
head
without
much
retention
and
only
minimal
lacing
on
a
murky
burnt
orange
with
golden
and
copper
hues
aroma
of
cardboard
white
chocolate
apricot
cocoa
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavor
follows
with
vanilla
dominant
notes
with
additional
flavors
of
cocoa
cane
sugar
and
bourbon
medium
to
full
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
i
am
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
its
good
but
for
me
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
a
very
boozy
beer
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
didnt
know
what
to
think
about
this
beer
before
i
tried
it
i
really
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
like
it
instead
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
out
there
it
actually
taste
like
white
chocolate
it
is
beyond
delicious
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
gets
a
little
murky
but
the
flavor
is
still
there
i
love
this
beer
overall
white
chocolate
bomb
the
tartness
was
a
real
pleasant
surprise
as
well
the
14
whatever
alcohol
is
not
a
factor
at
all
i
wouldnt
change
this
beer
ever
one
of
my
recent
favorites
good
night
cap
would
it
be
possible
to
make
a
better
wheatwine
than
this
theres
so
much
going
on
in
a
beer
that
seemed
destined
to
be
a
booze
and
sugar
bomb
the
blending
is
magnificent
here
and
the
flavors
come
in
spades
in
a
way
that
this
would
please
beer
bourbon
and
wine
drinkers
alike
a
true
pleasure
to
sip
on
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
that
i
could
cellar
and
see
how
this
would
develop
over
time
highly
recommended
the
first
beer
from
these
guys
that
i
can
safely
say
was
mindblowing
o
the
bruerys
white
chocolate
lives
up
to
its
name
smelling
and
tasting
like
a
liquified
brownie
made
with
booze
this
heavy
hitter
doesnt
deceive
its
alcohol
is
right
out
in
the
open
adding
complexity
to
the
white
chocolate
brew
mmm
delicious
61813
bottle
that
opened
cleanly
with
no
gush
slightly
cloudy
orangeblonde
body
with
a
little
white
head
around
the
top
you
can
smell
the
white
chocolate
especially
as
it
warms
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
some
bourbon
on
the
nose
as
well
oak
notes
on
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
the
finish
is
incredible
it
leaves
your
tongue
coated
in
white
chocolate
flavor
a
truly
impressive
beer
that
is
definitely
delivering
the
abv
it
doesnt
overpower
and
it
isnt
nearly
as
hot
as
other
fresh
bruery
bourbon
beers
very
little
tartness
quite
a
dessert
indeed
o
had
the
2012
and
thought
it
was
much
better
from
what
i
remember
fuller
body
and
lower
tartness
will
open
a
2012
in
the
next
few
days
to
compare
overall
better
than
i
expected
would
buy
again
o
im
very
pleased
with
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
this
is
a
true
work
of
art
that
im
sure
isnt
for
everyone
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
normally
im
not
one
to
reach
for
the
white
chocolate
my
preference
lying
with
the
dark
or
peanut
butterfilled
but
who
am
i
to
turn
down
some
barrelaged
wheatwine
goodness
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
auburn
topped
by
a
halffinger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
bourbon
light
candied
orange
peel
vanilla
bean
buttercream
light
oak
and
a
twinge
of
booze
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
orange
coming
through
a
bit
stronger
though
tempered
a
bit
by
the
booze
still
the
sweetness
is
what
reigns
supreme
here
but
not
in
a
southern
tier
creme
brulee
sort
of
way
more
restrained
due
to
the
overt
cooperation
of
its
constituent
parts
basically
the
complexity
of
the
sweetness
plays
off
of
itself
rather
than
having
it
serve
to
oerwash
all
else
as
in
the
aforementioned
new
yorkbased
stout
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
rather
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
wheatwine
one
that
somehow
did
not
overdo
things
with
the
barrel
and
the
additives
despite
how
easily
it
certainly
could
have
good
times
o
love
this
decadent
delight
should
come
with
its
own
cake
tin
overall
maybe
its
something
with
the
bottle
once
its
in
a
glass
and
sits
for
a
while
it
completely
changed
and
was
enjoyable
people
also
need
to
remember
that
regardless
of
the
name
and
description
on
the
label
its
still
a
wheat
wine
style
beer
all
said
i
will
voluntary
pick
up
a
couple
more
of
these
as
i
suspect
this
will
be
really
great
with
a
year
or
two
under
its
belt
the
booze
will
get
ya
for
sure
smells
amazing
and
lacks
nowhere
age
worthy
for
sure
and
something
id
like
to
revisit
years
from
now
i
wonder
about
beers
like
this
did
the
bruery
make
this
beer
and
then
name
it
or
set
out
to
make
a
beer
that
tastes
like
white
chocolate
nailed
it
the
beer
is
really
sweet
pushing
it
but
not
over
the
edge
and
has
a
nice
vanilla
flavor
to
it
creamy
smooth
no
alcohol
sneaking
through
thick
bodied
it
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
a
committment
to
drink
it
i
wont
turn
it
down
in
the
future
but
it
is
a
big
task
to
drink
this
alone
one
of
the
only
wheatwines
i
think
tastes
good
o
i
hope
this
beer
rounds
out
and
cleans
up
not
bad
right
now
but
it
has
room
for
improvement
especially
at
the
price
point
i
never
got
the
cacao
nibs
in
this
though
although
i
suppose
i
could
conjure
the
chocolate
portion
of
the
name
overall
not
what
i
expected
i
love
the
bruery
i
belong
to
the
preservation
club
and
i
saw
this
online
to
purchase
bought
two
bottles
received
next
day
shipping
and
cooled
to
55
degrees
first
bottle
i
thought
was
a
fluke
saw
all
these
posts
and
deceided
to
pop
other
bottle
wont
buy
again
o
my
wife
isnt
a
beer
drinker
but
loves
wine
and
ports
she
actually
likes
this
beer
not
something
id
like
to
drink
more
than
once
in
a
blue
moon
but
it
really
succeeds
as
a
good
dessert
beer
o
this
is
a
very
good
wheatwine
but
the
bourbon
dominates
the
flavor
alcohol
warmth
is
very
present
but
it
is
14
5
hard
to
consider
this
a
summertime
wheatwine
when
it
drinks
like
a
big
slow
sippin
brew
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
on
tap
i
would
drink
it
again
while
this
smells
sweet
the
taste
lags
behind
and
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
it
tasted
a
bit
sweeter
as
it
is
i
would
drink
this
beer
colder
with
a
dessert
pairing
the
smell
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
its
probably
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
ever
had
the
rest
of
the
beer
holds
up
rather
well
but
is
nowhere
near
as
awesome
as
the
smell
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
as
with
other
bruery
beers
its
just
not
something
i
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
thanks
again
for
sharing
this
one
doug
o
i
dont
know
that
im
going
to
be
able
to
explain
this
one
it
just
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
think
the
amount
of
maltiness
didnt
stand
up
to
the
treatments
and
its
just
too
sweet
to
drink
much
of
it
lacks
the
heft
of
a
nice
barrelaged
barleywine
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
just
came
away
disappointed
in
general
id
be
tempted
to
give
it
a
second
go
but
at
this
price
point
i
dont
know
that
i
will
o
beer
doesnt
look
all
the
great
and
the
nose
isnt
earth
shattering
but
everything
is
amazing
great
beer
very
interesting
idea
worth
seeking
out
thanks
sstorck
t
one
of
my
friends
i
was
tasting
this
with
called
it
best
this
tastes
like
a
white
chocolate
clif
bar
its
almost
identical
to
the
white
chocolate
coating
that
they
use
i
get
cocoa
bourbon
milk
chocolate
a
lingering
almost
sour
finish
and
just
a
touch
of
oak
slight
burn
from
the
booze
but
this
beer
is
just
money
skol
o
absolutely
delicious
c
o
very
delicious
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
wheatwines
although
i
dont
get
to
try
many
full
bodied
milder
carbonation
creamy
sticky
and
soft
on
the
tongue
similar
to
what
others
have
said
this
beer
is
wildly
expressive
and
flavorful
although
insanely
sweet
and
rich
we
split
a
bottle
between
4
people
and
finished
every
drop
overall
a
fantastic
product
i
would
strongly
recommend
pairing
this
with
white
chocolate
desserts
however
any
more
than
the
4
or
5
ounces
i
had
would
probably
result
in
me
feeling
quite
ill
this
beer
most
closely
resembles
a
fancy
afterdinner
chocolate
liquer
both
in
taste
apparent
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
the
bruery
knows
how
to
make
big
beer
bombs
both
the
good
kind
the
bad
this
is
one
of
the
former
sneaking
over
the
border
of
excellent
o
this
is
so
sugary
sweet
but
damn
it
does
it
fit
the
name
perfectly
very
interesting
to
say
the
least
very
happy
we
split
this
5
ways
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
brew
the
time
in
the
barrels
gave
this
beer
some
really
nice
bourbon
flavors
and
the
vanilla
and
cacao
gave
it
an
incredible
finish
definitely
a
very
tasty
sipper
ill
admit
that
as
a
huge
fan
of
both
wheatwines
and
white
chocolate
that
i
may
be
predisposed
towards
this
but
the
bruery
has
done
a
truly
outstanding
job
here
every
aspect
has
been
nailed
hands
down
the
best
wheatwine
ive
had
and
definately
in
my
top
35
beers
im
super
excited
for
the
chance
to
buy
more
when
they
release
it
later
this
year
almost
no
head
and
carbonation
the
white
chocolate
was
there
but
not
the
same
as
i
got
in
the
chocolate
rain
pity
cause
this
beer
could
have
been
made
much
better
glad
to
have
it
though
because
i
love
the
other
bruery
beers
exept
the
sour
ones
my
respect
to
the
bruery
for
pulling
this
off
it
really
does
smell
like
beautiful
white
chocolate
bottle
from
trade
white
wax
top
pours
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
small
head
that
dissapates
quickly
unique
aroma
of
sour
butter
bread
dough
yeast
wheat
hints
of
spice
a
bit
of
campfire
low
to
medium
carbonation
flavor
is
astringent
alcohol
but
not
bad
white
chocolate
and
citrus
maple
syrup
maybe
with
an
alcohol
finish
that
stings
almost
like
a
white
chocolate
rum
but
the
citrus
and
syrup
flavors
balance
this
out
medium
to
heavy
syrup
mouthfeel
neat
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
with
friends
and
family
a
sipper
a
little
goes
along
way
easily
sharable
with
4
to
6
people
at
2
to
4oz
pours
if
you
can
trade
for
it
do
it
glad
i
still
have
quite
a
few
bottles
left
to
enjoy
in
the
coming
years
pours
a
clear
amber
slightly
hazy
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
a
white
chocolatey
marshmallow
with
some
oak
and
chocolate
tasty
beer
with
great
chocolate
and
ghram
cracker
bit
of
wheat
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
like
a
barleywine
and
drinkable
very
sweet
but
drinkable
a
bit
boozy
this
is
tasty
but
not
crazy
unbelievable
overall
an
impressive
take
on
a
wheatwine
very
creative
and
quite
tasty
without
any
excessive
sweetness
as
mentioned
very
cool
beer
d
deceptively
tasty
for
the
abv
overall
how
does
this
get
a
4

on
this
site
i
understand
that
people
like
the
bruerys
high
abv
booze
bombs
and
there
are
some
good
ones
but
this
is
definitely
bottom
of
the
barrel
in
that
department
while
the
nose
showed
some
promise
this
was
artificial
tasting
boozy
muted
and
the
feel
was
light
and
harsh
making
it
difficult
to
choke
down
my
6oz
glass
fruet
was
leagues
better
than
this
proving
that
the
bruery
can
make
high
quality
booze
bombs
this
was
a
complete
disaster
however
drain
even
had
a
tough
time
with
this
and
shes
dealt
with
some
doozies
in
the
past
im
glad
you
boys
were
thinking
of
me
when
this
came
out
so
i
greatly
appreciate
the
bottles
gents
cant
win
em
all
d
very
bold
complex
and
interesting
but
also
very
well
balanced
d
really
good
excellent
flavor
for
description
of
beer
a
bit
warming
but
not
bad
for
14

percent
recommend
sitting
on
it
for
a
year
or
two
8

prickly
alcohol
heat
sugary
sweetness
viscous
syrupy
body
chocolate
and
barrel
flavors
not
especially
deep
more
boozy
than
anything
not
really
a
high
fan
though
it
lives
up
to
its
name
at
least
o
this
is
an
awesome
desert
beer
and
perfect
to
share
with
that
said
i
could
take
this
down
solo
with
pleasure
this
beer
along
with
fruet
and
melange
make
me
happy
to
be
an
rs
member
and
make
me
feel
like
the
bruery
owns
this
countrys
best
barrel
program
and
i
havent
even
had
cr
bt
or
gm
soon
this
is
a
delicious
beer
from
an
amazing
brewery
known
for
its
big
complex
beers
i
am
sadly
not
a
reserve
society
member
so
im
not
sure
when
ill
have
another
shot
at
it
but
i
will
definitely
jump
at
the
chance
should
it
arise
overall
how
does
the
bruery
take
these
monster
beers
and
make
them
so
smooth
its
beyond
me
this
is
probably
the
best
wheatwine
that
i
have
had
it
a
tough
style
to
do
really
well
in
my
mind
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
really
thought
it
was
solid
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
the
best
aspects
of
this
beer
thanks
bigtomz
for
the
opportunity
o
interesting
beer
definitely
get
some
white
chocolate
character
here
but
quite
a
bit
more
too
a
bit
of
a
sipper
and
not
as
smooth
as
i
expected
but
still
very
enjoyable
not
quite
a
dessert
beer
either
would
definitely
like
to
have
again
o
phenominal
beer
worth
the
trade
demand
i
put
the
value
at
34
kh
follow
up
gave
a
great
spiciness
to
my
slow
cooked
meat
pot
2
weeks
after
opening
verdict
a
very
nice
bourbon
barrel
beer
from
the
bruery
while
certainly
a
sweet
sipping
beer
the
richness
is
moderately
kept
in
check
making
this
a
great
beer
to
share
for
desert
overall
mixed
the
nose
is
great
the
taste
starts
great
but
seems
to
fade
the
more
it
opens
and
especially
as
the
booze
really
kicks
in
quite
a
nice
beer
if
the
booze
didnt
really
kick
in
and
i
wish
some
of
the
great
aromas
like
bourbon
and
vanilla
were
more
present
on
the
flavor
curious
how
this
will
age
could
be
great
as
the
booze
mellows
and
the
flavors
merge
or
could
be
bad
as
all
the
great
characteristics
fade
out
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
like
this
much
more
than
white
oak
not
sure
how
this
will
hold
up
to
age
though
overall
white
chocolate
is
a
really
interesting
beer
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
any
lover
of
big
sweet
beers
that
said
have
a
few
friends
on
hand
as
a
full
750
gets
a
little
much
the
beer
is
yellowish
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
offers
vanilla
oak
chocolate
malt
booze
fabulous
flavor
super
smooth
and
teeming
with
flavor
vanilla
candy
and
seriously
white
chocolate
alcohol
is
certainly
there
but
doesnt
bother
me
delicious
would
happily
have
this
again
o
yeah
i
want
more
of
this
its
not
a
revelation
but
its
beautifully
accurate
and
rich
yep
drink
it
and
enjoy
the
confection
an
interesting
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
cheers
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
its
not
for
everyone
and
id
never
want
an
entire
bottle
to
myself
but
its
great
in
small
quantities
o
smell
is
different
but
tast
is
very
nice
white
chocolate
for
sure
o
this
is
a
fun
ass
big
american
beer
not
something
i
wanna
drink
very
often
but
the
bruery
did
a
great
job
at
making
a
white
chocolate
wheat
wine
thats
exactly
what
it
smells
and
tastes
like
if
your
one
of
those
people
that
just
goes
crazy
for
big
sweet
beers
this
and
a
lot
of
the
bruery
beers
are
for
you
if
you
dont
want
to
be
drinking
sweet
boozy
beer
then
i
understand
its
not
for
most
occasions
and
i
could
see
how
this
brew
could
even
offend
some
beerdrinkers
its
just
fucking
nuts
that
only
american
brewers
and
the
bruery
would
try
to
pull
off
i
think
it
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
some
next
level
shit
obviously
a
beer
like
this
will
only
get
better
with
time
to
mellow
out
m
medium
to
full
bodied
wish
there
was
there
was
some
carb
but
its
fine
without
o
overall
great
white
chocolate
o
this
one
ends
up
tasting
like
the
name
well
maybe
a
bit
more
like
frosting
but
the
white
chocolate
is
definitely
there
which
leads
me
to
have
mixed
emotions
about
this
beer
on
the
one
end
this
beer
tastes
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
and
it
is
a
very
creative
take
on
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
on
the
other
it
is
sweet
with
a
candylike
taste
and
i
dont
want
to
drink
a
glass
of
candy
in
the
end
i
imagine
your
appreciation
for
this
beer
will
largely
depend
on
your
like
or
dislike
for
white
chocolate
white
chocolate
pours
a
hazy
auburn
turning
positively
opaque
with
the
final
pour
maybe
two
fingers
of
bone
colored
foam
forms
to
fill
out
he
top
of
the
glass
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
minimal
this
ones
just
not
much
of
a
looker
the
nose
though
is
fantastic
lots
of
vanilla
some
toasted
brown
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
bourbon
it
really
does
live
up
to
its
name
the
balance
shifts
a
little
bit
in
the
flavor
profile
vanilla
is
still
the
central
focus
here
perhaps
even
moreso
than
in
the
aroma
the
brown
sugar
disappears
entirely
leaving
more
room
for
the
chocolate
and
especially
the
bourbon
still
the
vanilla
is
just
a
little
bit
overbearing
here
the
mouthfeel
though
is
as
good
as
you
could
ask
for
from
a
beer
like
this
the
body
is
only
heavy
enough
that
id
guess
the
beer
was
9
or
so
abv
and
the
carbonation
is
just
enough
to
cut
through
the
beer
without
distracting
in
any
way
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
white
chocolate
given
my
mixed
reaction
to
white
oak
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
itd
be
a
great
bottle
to
open
after
a
meal
with
a
few
friends
4
0
d
this
may
be
the
only
bruery
beer
ever
made
that
is
both
super
high
in
abv
and
not
diabetesinducingly
sweet
which
is
why
a
bruery
beer
is
usually
the
only
option
if
that
itch
needs
to
be
scratched
that
said
this
is
far
too
drinkable
you
dont
have
to
chew
it
and
you
dont
have
to
wince
from
the
booze
tinge
its
pretty
tasty
and
definitely
worth
a
try
does
it
taste
much
like
actual
white
chocolate
no
not
really
but
im
thrilled
about
that
since
white
chocolate
doesnt
do
much
for
me
anyway
o
i
have
to
say
i
am
by
any
means
not
a
fan
of
white
chocolate
candy
but
damn
this
beer
is
delicious
and
the
aroma
is
crazy
nuts
the
only
con
is
that
the
sweetness
is
pretty
intense
and
you
might
go
diabetic
after
this
one
o
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
well
done
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
wheatwines
ive
had
to
be
honest
very
interesting
nose
and
taste
with
a
lot
of
white
chocolate
and
vanilla
pretty
cool
how
they
nailed
it
the
only
downside
id
say
here
is
that
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
to
it
not
terrible
considering
how
high
the
abv
is
but
i
was
hoping
it
was
hidden
a
little
better
than
it
is
still
quite
good
and
something
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
o
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
sticky
sweet
beers
this
beer
is
for
you
amazing
flavor
profile
coupled
with
a
unusual
mouth
feel
make
this
beer
a
winner
in
my
book
the
longer
i
held
onto
it
and
let
it
warm
up
the
better
it
got
this
beer
is
another
beer
i
would
recommend
d
i
didnt
really
like
the
aroma
much
but
once
i
got
past
that
there
was
a
really
enjoyable
beer
to
be
found
its
very
sweet
and
best
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
but
may
be
the
best
bruery
offering
ive
had
in
a
while
if
you
like
white
chocolate
like
i
do
then
check
this
one
out
overall
i
was
skeptical
about
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
it
totally
delivered
i
do
not
like
super
cloying
or
boozy
beers
and
you
would
expect
this
to
be
both
but
thankfully
it
is
not
either
definitely
a
sweeter
beer
a
beer
to
share
with
others
and
sipperpostdinner
beverage
i
would
say
crack
one
of
these
open
instead
of
thanksgiving
christmas
or
valentines
day
dessert
not
sure
if
the
misses
will
approve
and
share
with
family
friends
and
loved
ones
the
drinkability
of
this
is
dangerous
i
dont
feel
at
all
like
im
drinking
a
30proof
beer
sweet
sugary
good
for
dessert
overall
share
this
one
like
with
4
or
more
people
i
split
this
bottle
and
it
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
it
is
very
sweet
and
pretty
heavy
this
is
dessert
have
a
slice
of
cake
rather
then
the
whole
thing
a
little
reminiscent
of
chocolate
rain
with
a
sweeter
finish
points
for
creativity
glad
to
have
tried
it
thanks
taturbo
o
this
is
like
a
white
chocolate
version
of
black
tuesday
or
a
sauternes
a
good
dessert
beer
optimal
in
small
doses
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
white
chocolate
to
begin
with
so
it
isnt
surprising
that
i
wasnt
gushing
over
this
beer
like
the
others
at
our
tasting
were
if
thats
your
thing
though
youre
gonna
love
this
beer
m
medium
body
chewy
light
carbonation
o
overall
i
loved
it
what
else
is
there
to
say
world
class
aroma
and
complex
tasty
flavor
profile
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
a
must
try
for
fans
of
big
beers
thanks
again
matt
for
sending
this
my
way
o
when
the
beer
was
announced
i
was
skeptical
i
thought
white
oak
was
horrendous
and
taking
a
component
of
it
seemed
similarly
destined
for
failure
i
will
concede
that
this
was
better
than
i
had
anticipated
but
it
was
still
not
a
great
beer
as
someone
else
remarked
im
a
little
sad
that
i
have
14
bottles
of
it
i
dont
think
im
in
the
target
market
here
finally
picked
up
my
allocations
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
scent
is
wow
i
remember
reading
reviews
of
this
beer
when
it
was
first
released
and
someone
said
it
didnt
have
a
good
nose
on
it
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that
the
nose
is
like
a
delicious
desert
i
get
some
definite
white
chocolate
even
a
little
bit
of
a
cheesecake
aroma
sweet
boozy
vanilla
aromas
with
some
lovely
bourbon
a
good
amount
of
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
orange
taste
is
not
a
dessertish
as
the
nose
it
is
definitely
still
a
sipper
and
rich
like
a
desert
but
the
wheatwine
characteristics
kick
in
making
it
not
so
rich
still
has
some
boozy
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavors
but
also
has
some
orange
citrus
flavors
some
light
maple
syrup
flavors
with
a
sharp
cloying
sweetness
almost
on
the
back
of
the
palate
very
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
style
as
it
is
not
overly
carbonated
and
not
too
fullbodied
drinkability
is
fairly
high
for
what
this
is
overall
there
is
no
way
in
hell
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
as
it
is
far
too
rich
and
sweet
for
one
sitting
however
when
shared
amongst
friends
this
beer
is
brilliant
pours
a
cloudy
dark
golden
amber
with
a
nice
sized
off
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
of
vanilla
bourbon
oak
white
chocolate
honey
vanilla
frosting
and
a
solid
shot
of
ethanol
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
lots
of
sweet
vanilla
and
white
chocolate
up
front
with
a
solid
bourbon
oak
flavor
and
plenty
of
alcohol
to
remind
you
this
is
a
huge
beer
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
quite
different
im
not
sure
this
needed
to
be
14
5
abv
but
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
for
most
of
the
night
o
bg
sweet
sticky
beeper
that
brings
a
nice
white
chocolate
and
oak
flavor
still
really
boozy
and
would
love
to
have
this
settle
down
to
see
what
develops
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
really
fitting
of
the
name
the
aroma
especially
screams
white
chocolate
with
a
pretty
solid
inclusion
in
the
flavor
as
well
this
is
quite
a
hearty
sipper
that
i
could
never
imagine
sitting
down
and
wanting
to
kill
a
whole
bottle
of
the
solvent
alcohol
aside
it
really
is
taxing
to
the
palate
perhaps
even
more
so
than
black
tuesdaychocolate
rain
fans
of
wheatwine
will
want
to
give
this
a
try
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
absolutely
incredible
and
is
of
white
chocolate
vanilla
beans
cocoa
and
bourbonalcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
sweet
flavor
and
a
mild
tartness
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
an
exceptional
smell
and
great
flavors
drink
i
thought
it
was
fantastic
so
sad
i
am
not
an
rs
member
to
land
a
bottle
or
2
to
sit
on
will
try
to
get
one
though
oh
yes
it
will
be
mine
i
like
big
boozy
beers
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
fans
of
more
integrated
less
aggressive
booze
will
want
to
sit
on
this
a
while
flavors
are
very
solid
although
not
quite
to
the
level
of
chocolate
rain
a
very
interesting
concoction
thanks
again
patrick
tyler
et
al
just
awesome
i
dont
think
anybody
actually
expected
this
to
tasteresemble
white
chocolate
but
it
does
pours
very
light
with
a
very
small
head
it
looks
like
the
wheatwine
cousin
of
black
tuesday
oh
wow
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
unbelievable
enormous
flavor
of
wait
for
it
white
chocolate
like
potent
sweet
vanilla

one
of
the
best
bourbon
aged
beers
out
there
serving
type
bottle
a
little
too
sweet
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
from
these
guys
semi
tart
apricot
front
with
medium
malt
finish
hefty
but
not
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
quite
a
wonderful
barleywine
while
rather
sweet
the
thick
rye
and
bit
of
hop
flavor
that
comes
at
the
end
of
the
taste
really
help
balance
the
beer
and
make
it
a
nice
slow
sipper
this
flavor
profile
mixed
with
the
wonderful
aroma
and
fantastic
feel
make
this
one
a
must
try
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
a
very
good
and
impressive
beer
captures
everything
i
like
about
rye
and
wraps
it
nicely
into
a
beer
that
is
drinkable
complex
and
tasty
great
combination
of
fruity
and
rye
taste
o
this
is
really
damn
solid
it
has
a
nice
combination
of
sweetness
spiciness
and
even
smokiness
it
could
be
more
complex
but
i
dont
care
certainly
worth
tryingworth
buyingworth
trading
for
o
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
an
interesting
beer
something
to
savor
enjoy
and
ponder
its
plethora
of
flavors
if
this
was
barrel
aged
it
would
be
a
monster
o
this
is
delicious
i
really
need
to
go
pick
up
some
repent
and
misery
the
beer
is
opaque
and
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
cap
the
aroma
brings
brown
bread
lots
of
booze
in
a
pleasant
way
fruity
esters
a
hint
of
spice
perhaps
some
clove
really
big
flavor
rye
bread
and
a
delectable
sweetness
that
never
becomes
cloying
im
typically
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheatwines
ryewines
but
this
one
really
hit
the
mark
a
surprise
winner
from
duclaw
recommended
overall
very
enjoyable
fruit
esters
and
hops
more
pronounced
when
it
warms
a
bit
great
sipper
overall
the
flavors
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
grand
cru
but
without
the
yeasty
flavors
and
with
a
bit
more
of
a
boozy
flavor
this
was
a
rather
interesting
warming
brew
and
while
i
would
not
come
back
to
it
again
and
again
it
is
worth
a
try
and
possibly
a
time
to
time
revisiting
bottle
poured
a
deep
golden
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
residual
sugar
notes
with
some
caramelized
malt
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
caramelized
malt
with
some
light
grainy
notes
and
a
dry
finish
body
is
slighter
thinner
then
average
with
average
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
thought
this
was
not
as
warm
as
most
wheat
wine
ive
taste
before
and
probably
a
tad
more
dry
then
i
was
expecting
nicley
done
duclaw
i
just
didnt
enjoy
the
taste
or
numbing
mouthfeel
of
this
one
o
pretty
good
wheat
wine
big
and
robust
and
the
wheat
is
definitely
in
the
forefront
served
in
a
snifter
a
dark
golden
liquid
slightly
hazy
topped
with
a
small
but
solid
cap
of
white
head
a
slight
swirl
left
traces
of
laces
on
the
glass
in
the
nose
sweet
bready
malts
citrus
notes
yeast
peppery
spice
i
dont
think
this
saw
any
barrel
time
but
there
were
some
earthywoody
notes
in
the
aroma
and
taste
taste
of
caramel
malts
fairly
sweet
but
kept
in
check
by
a
pithy
characteristic
dry
toasted
wheat
light
peppery
spice
grain
alcohol
leafy
hops
with
a
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
worth
a
round
maybe
even
two
but
thatd
probably
be
enough
for
me
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
has
lots
of
tropical
fruits
taste
is
mild
compared
to
the
smell
there
are
tropical
fruits
some
sweetness
alcohol
is
present
a
touch
of
hops
easy
drinking
for
this
abv
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
one
of
the
best
wheatwines
ive
had
should
have
bought
more
dammit
d
this
was
yet
another
enjoyable
offering
from
duclaw
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
perhaps
a
bit
cloying
but
those
are
rather
minor
critiques
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
overall
this
one
of
quite
enjoyable
with
good
depth
and
character
d
a
better
than
average
wheat
wine
which
isnt
necessarily
saying
much
in
this
case
i
actually
kind
of
like
this
one
it
has
a
pleasant
fruity
character
that
balances
any
if
the
harshness
that
rna
other
examples
of
the
style
thin
head
on
a
clear
deep
golden
with
copper
hues
body
excellent
lacing
very
sweet
aroma
with
candied
citrus
caramel
malts
and
grape
notes
flavor
follows
well
but
is
even
sweeter
too
sweet
and
medicinal
up
front
with
thick
caramel
malts
candied
citrus
and
finishing
a
touch
bitter
and
sour
with
earthy
and
chardonnay
notes
creamy
body
and
lighter
side
of
moderate
carbonation
not
an
expert
on
this
style
i
just
know
i
dont
like
it
very
much
cant
honestly
say
if
this
is
a
good
version
or
not
but
overall
too
sweet
for
me
o
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
come
across
wheatwine
or
no
any
time
i
can
easily
finish
a
bomber
of
a
10
beer
its
usually
a
great
thing
cant
say
drinking
this
gives
me
the
feeling
of
misery
maybe
when
its
all
gone
ill
feel
this
misery
duclaw
preaches
but
right
now
all
i
feel
sipping
this
is
glee
d
very
good
beer
but
i
just
want
a
little
more
flavor
out
of
the
style
we
split
this
bottle
and
it
was
too
drinkable
for
better
of
worse
barrel
age
this
then
a
totally
solid
wheatwine
not
miserable
at
all
and
at
a
good
price
point
as
well
overall
i
think
the
beer
fits
the
style
and
seems
to
be
a
good
representative
of
it
my
personal
experience
in
this
style
is
limited
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
ride
very
good
beer
the
combo
of
flavors
is
interesting
in
a
wheatwine
no
scratch
that
unique
odd
but
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
a
little
syrupy
overall
carbonation
is
moderate
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
solid
beer
of
the
style
it
wasnt
amazing
in
any
of
the
categories
but
very
enjoyable
overall
d
a
lot
of
potential
in
this
glass
just
needs
some
time
to
mellow
alcohol
gets
in
the
way
of
citrusfruit
nuances
otherwise
a
great
bottle
to
put
away
in
the
cellar
and
share
with
some
friends
o
nice
wheaty
boozy
sweetness
this
is
complex
chewy
and
overall
enjoyable
sweet
boozy
and
thick
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
pours
an
auburn
type
body
w
minimal
head
and
lace
a
very
fruity
aroma
im
picking
up
cherry
for
some
reason
as
well
as
hints
of
citric
but
nothing
too
sour
also
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
and
some
caramel
malt
strong
bite
from
the
alcohol
and
spice
but
not
overpowering
definitely
a
thick
sipper
i
actually
taste
a
sharp
caramel
and
sugary
sweetness
balancing
w
a
yeastwheat
twang
which
makes
the
beer
go
down
easier
and
fruit
flavors
im
picking
up
things
like
black
cherries
and
some
herbal
citric
bitterness
as
well
as
a
touch
of
tropical
and
tart
fruits
a
strong
beer
w
a
strong
finish
this
is
a
great
after
dinner
sipper
o
this
beer
sort
of
blew
me
away
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
barleywine
only
a
little
sweeter
this
was
my
first
wheatwine
experience
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
o
nice
brew
from
duclaw
not
quite
world
class
but
a
totally
solid
brew
that
you
should
pick
up
and
check
out
if
you
see
it
enjoyed
it
o
this
one
is
a
little
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
of
things
for
my
liking
o
i
couldnt
bear
the
misery
induced
by
this
beer
and
ending
up
drain
pouring
half
of
it
odd
cloying
sweet
alcoholic
orange
juice
very
solid
almost
like
a
light
barleywine
but
in
a
good
way
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
duclaw
a
must
try

the

is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate

and
a

light
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
wheatwine
though
eversoslightly
boozy
for
my
liking
nice
to
see
the
style
continues
to
spread
o
to
date
the
best
wheatwine
ive
tasted
d
only
due
to
the
high
abv
and
the
fact
you
can
taste
and
feel
it
right
away
i
had
to
give
this
a
lower
drinkability
score
id
only
have
1
serving
but
savor
it
im
pretty
sure
this
is
a
wheatwine
and
maybe
one
i
have
had
before
so
lets
see
duclaw
brewing
misery
wheat
wine
sweet
this
is
tasty
and
while
i
got
the
style
right
i
have
never
had
this
yet
alone
heard
of
it
thanks
again
nate
recently
saw
this
available
in
a
bomber
and
thought
id
give
it
a
try
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
smells
of
honey
golden
currants
tart
apples
and
late
summer
goodness
thick
in
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
a
certain
sipper
alcohol
heat
is
there
from
the
beginning
but
as
you
work
through
it
you
get
some
blood
orange
mixed
with
honey
peaches
and
general
breadiness
i
enjoyed
this
overall
but
i
would
sit
my
next
bottle
in
the
cellar
for
awhile
in
hopes
that
the
alcohol
heat
would
ease
somewhat
so
the
other
good
flavors
would
be
more
prominent
from
the
get
go
as
it
stands
now
a
good
beer
to
try
and
share
with
a
friend
d
this
had
very
nice
honey
wheat
character
that
was
really
clean
and
tasty
it
grew
on
my
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
too
smooth
body
also
but
the
alcohol
was
quite
noticeable
so
drinkability
was
slightly
hindered
age
may
help
mellow
that
out
but
it
was
still
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
fresh
recommended
on
tap
at
a
beer
tasting
event
in
md
a
clear
copper
pour
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
a
sweet
aroma
that
features
some
golden
delicious
apples
golden
raisins
vanilla
extract
and
a
little
oak
some
juicy
oranges
lemons
grapefruits
and
some
floral
qualities
become
apparent
after
it
sits
some
medium
to
fullbodied
and
just
a
touch
syrupy
on
the
way
down
caramel
candied
sugar
and
vanilla
upfront
in
the
taste
peach
and
apricot
follow
some
sweet
oranges
at
the
end
along
with
a
touch
of
bittering
grapefruits
quite
sweet
all
the
way
through
a
tad
cloying
by
the
end
not
nearly
as
warming
as
i
wouldve
expected
based

it

aged
surprisingly
well

to
try
it
in
a

or
so
had
this
in
a
snifter
at
xmas
in

in
arundel
mills
this
is
an
unfiltered
beer
that
pours
a
hazy
dark
bronze
with
hues
of
red
and
a

of
offwhite

the

this

a

for

one
of
the
best
that
duclaw

made
mouthfeel

are
both
really
high
for
a

this
powerful
the

cloaked
well
and
the
combination
of
taste
just
right
carbonation
and
aroma
can
lead
one

this
also
gets

you

o
fantastic
and
interesting
approach
to
the

huge

flavors
earthy
and
fruity
with
a
taste

sour
funk
nicely
done
coops
territorial
series
have
been
great
so
far
im
glad
to
see
this
adventurous
side
to
brewing
well
done
o
the
bugs
ran
away
with
this
beer
leaving
only
a
sample
of
a
wheatwine
while
many
of
the
tasting
notes
common
to
a
wheatwine
are
opresent
the
underlying
sweet
fluffy
and
fullness
a
wheatwine
should
provide
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
wheat
and
orange
citrus
notes
in
it
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
tartness
the
flavor
is
similar
the
tart
and
lightly
sour
orange
citrus
notes
come
through
first
but
they
are
backed
up
by
a
good
dose
of
wheat
there
is
also
a
nice
amount
of
funk
and
leather
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
goodsized
thin
and
bubbly
offwhite
head
clears
out
quickly
leaving
scattered
bubbles
around
the
edge
brass
in
color
with
a
chill
haze
and
some
reddish
orange
around
the
edges
sour
fruits
apples
white
grapes
are
first
noticed
to
the
nose
and
i
must
admit
the
level
of
funkiness
is
bit
unexpected
but
quite
nice
following
are
some
fresh
wheat
notes
a
bit
of
lemon
and
some
belgian
yeast
tastes
sweet
with
an
almost
cloying
aftertaste
and
bit
metallic
in
parts
further
inspection
reveals
a
fruity
creamy
core
banana
anyone
some
caramel
and
grain
the
initial
sweetness
subsides
and
the
beer
balances
quickly
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
is
distant
and
this
one
is
dangerous
because
it
slowly
draws
you
in
with
a
sweet
siren
song
before
you
know
it
you
are
deep
within
its
clutches
a
fact
that
is
not
necessarily
bad
news
because
this
beauty
comes
in
a
magnum
so
theres
plenty
more
funky
goodness
to
be
had
before
the
fun
is
over
this
is
a
hybrid
brew
not
really
a
wheat
wine
and
not
really
a
wild
ale
some
have
criticized
the
lack
of
a
discernible
category
however
i
find
the
end
result
fantastic
and
leaving
me
without
a
care
in
the
world
as
to
what
style
it
is
what
should
be
a
strong
sour
profile
is
masked
by
alfalfa
honey
which
only
adds
to
the
complexity
and
layering
of
flavor
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
id
compare
it
to
some
of
the
russian
river
beers
p
s
whoever
had
the
idea
to
print
savor
the
rarity
on
the
label
should
be
backhanded
overall
im
very
grateful
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
extremely
limited
beer
thanks
ken
o
seems
more
a
wild
ale
then
anything
the
beer
is
an
actual
honest
mistake
that
proved
to
be
fantastic
well
this
hybrid
take
on
the
style
seems
to
work
very
well
the
wild
yeast
and
wood
add
a
deep
level
of
layering
very
complex
aroma
and
super
mouthfeel
are
the
strongest
components
alcohol
is
there
per
style
but
adds
a
sharpness
that
really
works
with
the
floral
aspects
not
sure
about
the
abv
but
im
guessing
its
around
10
5
i
bought
a
couple
of
extra
bottles
on
a
gamble
and
im
glad
i
did
overall
a
full
bodied
surprisingly
easy
drinking
wheat
wine
a
good
dessert
beer
even
if
just
after
lunch
delicious
smooth
mouthfeel
and
sweet
on
the
nose
i
can
definitely
sense
the
honey
hiding
in
the
background
and
its
sweet
from
beginning
to
end
an
easy
sipper
and
a
very
dangerous
beer
because
i
could
easily
throw
back
a
few
of
these
and
at
the

content
these
bad

could
quickly
do

twentyone

time
to
start
a
filibuster
of
my
own
in
the
forums
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttercream
bourbon
barrel
and
all
that
that
encompasses
and
a
touch
of
ancillary
booze
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
decided
undercurrent
of
candied
orange
peel
and
miscellaneous
dark
fruits
nice
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
barreled
wheatwine
the
base
really
cooperating
very
well
with
the
barrel
get
some
odstarted
high
and
ended
low
but
the
overall
experience
was
fun
happy
to
have
tried
it
reviewed
blind
as
part
of
blind
bif
7
figured
id
bring
this
over
to
my
halloween
shindig
share
some
blind
fun
with
others
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
smoky
topaz
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
sienna
foam
the
nose
comprises
honey
light
maple
syrup
light
clove
and
a
touch
of
rye
bread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
touch
of
wheat
and
a
large
amount
of
waxy
orange
rind
the
bitterness
of
the
latter
really
detracts
from
the
overall
experience
for
me
others
in
the
room
felt
otherwise
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
an
alright
wheatwine
but
one
that
suffers
from
overly
high
bitterness
i
do
like
the
approach
of
a
dunkelwheatwine
though
o
its
not
bad
at
all
just
very
simple
and
one
dimensional
bread
and
maple
syrup
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
round
it
out
maple
is
quite
nice
i
will
admit
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
maple
candy
very
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
good
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
o
much
milder
than
expected
clean
and
smooth
for
a
wheatwine
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
very
drinkable
o
not
gross
but
kind
of
a
letdown
a
bit
disappointing
due
to
price
paid
not
cheap
sat
on
this
since
last
spring
surprised
that
i
taste
no
maple
booze
seems
higher
than
advertised
abv
overall
this
way
just
a
huge
miss
for
me
maybe
it
is
still
too
young
and
the
sweetness
and
unbalanced
flavor
profile
will
further
meld
together
but
i
am
skeptical
not
recommended
and
definitely
not
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
taste
starts
sweet
dark
fruit
in
the
middle
and
then
a
maple
sugar
flavor
at
the
close
that
is
unlike
any
ive
experienced
in
a
brew
as
if
i
melted
a
maple
candy
in
my
mouth
with
the
mouthful
of
brew
slight
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
drinkability
is
sipping
but
definitely
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
this
brew
surprised
me
even
better
than
hoped
overall
pretty
good
some
booze
esters
sweet
nice
bitterness
to
sweet
malt
and
syrup
ratio
the
hop
flavor
could
have
been
a
bit
more
dominant
o
overall
i
didnt
think
this
beer
is
not
that
bad
that
being
said
im
not
a
fan
of
spending
16
for
this
still
not
the
worst
interval
ive
had
would
like
to
get
another
bottle
to
age
and
see
what
happens
with
the
flavors
im
a
little
disappointed
here
the
description
of
this
was
right
up
my
alley
it
just
didnt
work
nearly
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
o
i
dont
really
care
for
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
drink
kind
of
a
weird
combination
of
maple
citrus
and
hops
not
working
for
me
and
dont
care
to
have
this
again
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
local
is
good
flavors
are
good
overall
a
very
solid
brew
do
agree
this
was
an
easy
cork
to
remove
overall
definitely
a
sipper
i
really
dug
this
beer
most
maple
syrup
drinksbeers
taste
odd
to
me
but
somehow
the
balance
of
the
citrus
hops
really
worked
with
the
earthy
maple
and
wheat
sweetness
at
nearly
20
a
bottle
it
isnt
cheap
but
if
you
can
snag
one
of
these
and
split
it
with
someone
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
d
the
alcohol
isnt
very
well
hidden
for
a
beer
that
is
only
9
2
and
this
drinks
quite
heavy
i
actually
thought
it
was
stronger
while
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
largely
what
is
described
by
the
label
the
components
seem
to
clash
and
the
bitter
finish
is
just
plain
unpleasant
i
didnt
really
want
more
than
a
few
ounces
of
this
one
id
perhaps
try
it
again
to
see
if
the
alcohol
and
hop
flavors
dissipate
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
the
other
flavors
enough
to
think
that
it
might
turn
into
a
great
or
even
good
beer
overall
a
well
put
together
beer
one
that
is
good
now
and
probably
will
become
even
better
with
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
pours
redbrowncopper
strong
smell
of
apple
and
fruit
smell
very
sweet
taste
is
sweet
and
boozy
fruits
and
sugary
candy
my
first
experience
with
a
wheat
wine
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
good
and
worth
a
try
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
maybe
the
jury
is
still
out
on
this
style
for
me
true
to
style
with
its
grainy
sweetness
the
originality
of
verns
wheat
wine
is
in
its
fruitiness
this
is
a
great
wheat
wine
with
everything
i
look
for
in
the
style
plus
that
interesting
apple
and
cherry
factor
i
hope
this
site
is
wrong
about
this
being
discontinued
because
this
is
more
fine
work
from
straight
to
ale
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
maybe
not
the
best
wheat
wine
ive
had
but
very
nice
brew
i
like
this
a
ton
yummity
yum
yum
yum
im
amazed
to
be
drinking
an
11
abv
beer
from
alabama
while
verns
wheat
wine
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
huge
step
forward
for
a
state
thats
had
its
beer
shelves
flooded
with
mediocrity
its
alright
definitely
worth
a
tryespecially
if
you
live
in
alabama
o
very
nice
beer
would
definitely
drink
ago
easy
drinking
for
11
worth
trying
if
you
are
able
to
find
it
as
it
was
only
brewed
once
and
running
out
grab
one
if
you
see
it
and
try
it
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
didnt
seem
anything
like
the
previous
wheatwine
i
just
tried
this
tasted
like
an
old
ale
to
me
and
didnt
have
the
light
malt
character
or
hop
profile
id
expect
from
a
wheat
wine
overall
a
solid
attempt
at
a
tough
style
especially
laudable
due
to
the
brewerys
infancy
if
the
booziness
could
be
contained
just
a
bit
more
it
would
be
a
phenomenal
brew
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
i
by
no
means
regret
giving
it
a
try
as
to
the
other
review
i
hope
the
headache
went
away
and
that
reviewer
is
feeling
better
i
quite
enjoyed
this
wheat
wine
it
has
an
almost
spiciness
to
it
that
is
quite
unique
to
be
honest
at
11
this
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
for
what
most
would
think
would
be
a
sipping
ale
the
color
is
a
cloudy
reddish
color
and
the
mouthfeel
has
many
components
besides
a
bit
of
booziness
which
would
be
expected
for
something
this
high
in
abv
all
in
all
a
great
rendition
of
this
sparsely
attempted
style
good
job
straight
to
ale
o
pretty
average
i
almost
believe
this
beer
may
contain
sulfites
after
two
sips
i
received
the
worst
red
wine
like
headache
the
beer
pours
an
offwhite
and
creamy
head
that
dissipates
moderately
the
beer
itself
is
an
opaque
orange
brown
the
smell
has
strong
wheat
notes
with
what
appears
to
be
celery
there
are
also
some
light
notes
of
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
than
the
smell
in
the
taste
there
are
strong
notes
of
wheat
and
malt
the
malt
is
very
sweet
and
the
wheat
takes
the
edge
of
a
little
bit
the
celery
taste
is
interesting
in
that
it
is
a
very
nice
finish
to
the
more
sweet
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
bodied
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
drink
is
pretty
smooth
and
a
little
silky
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
getting
again
a
thick
and
hazy
rusty
walnut
colored
brew
with
pretty
solid
off
white
ring
and
scattering
a
of
cover
with
a
spotty
respectable
lace
in
retreat
the
aroma
is
delicate
but
undoubtedly
full
of
dry
grape
skin
and
grainy
alcohol
with
musty
cinnamon
lemon
grass
the
flavor
offers
wheat
apple
and
more
grape
skin
a
touch
of
honey
and
grainy
malt
alcohol
is
a
touch
heavy
so
the
flavors
have
to
contend
with
that
a
little
citrus
and
leafy
qualities
come
through
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
blend
the
body
is
medium
full
with
a
substantial
feel
yet
it
has
a
somewhat
aqueous
quality
that
drinks
nicely
but
ultimately
its
a
sipper
to
savor
and
goes
very
well
with
pepper
jack
cheddar
o
it
has
a
rough
around
the
edges
sort
of
charm
to
it
with
that
coarse
wheat
very
drinkable
and
surprisingly
dry
despite
its
size
note
batch

i
had
this
at
a
very
very
very
nice
boston
restaurant
something
like
a
champagne
cork
finish
had
me
expecting
a
lot
of
froth
but
it
poured
with
very
little
carbonation
seriously
cloudy
with
all
kinds
of
chunkies
not
that
chunkies
are
bad
i
like
the
earthy
rusticality
this
is
my
kind
of
aroma
toffee
and
toasted
walnuts
with
a
mild
hint
of
cocoa
yay
tastes
like
dark
caramel
and
is
really
nice
and
sweet
i
found
myself
just
letting
it
all
linger
between
sips
so
much

enjoy

of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
citrus
pit
fruit
slightly
soured
and
an
earthy
character
theres
also
a
bit
of
ethanol
towards
the
finish
taste
follows
nose
however
theres
a
slight
pepperyspicy
character
in
the
flavor
profile
malt
is
definitely
present
but
not
overly
forward
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
an
even
carbonation
the
falls
just
shy
of
lively
i
havent
had
too
many
wheatwines
however
i
found
this
one
to
be
decent
albeit
not
mindblowing
i
dont
see
age
doing
too
much
with
this
beer
either
i
do
have
to
say
that
the
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
overall
about
as
fruity
a
wheatwine
as
i
have
had
an
excellent
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
drunk
slow
i
would
get
this
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
good
for
the
style
and
great
overall
taste
is
sweet
and
clovey
to
start
fruit
and
spices
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
a
somewhat
harsh
alcohol
and
wheat
character
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
bumpy
harsh
alcohol
kind
of
upsetting
the
smoothness
one
would
expect
and
drinkability
is
okay
as
a
result
needs
a
bit
more
mellow
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
steady
carb
stream
feeding
a
huge
bubbly
tan
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
lightly
spiced
wheat
a
bit
of
orange
peel
and
grainy
bready
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
a
bit
subtle
theres
a
light
sweet
honey
like
malt
up
front
followed
by
some
bready
and
caramel
notes
as
well
as
a
hint
of
dark
berries
and
a
solid
dose
of
ethanol
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
nice
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
it
doesnt
really
excite
me
its
definitely
better
as
it
warms
but
its
crying
for
a
solid
dose
of
hops
in
my
opinion
for
11
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
very
smooth
with
well
balanced
flavor
old
powderhouse
pours
a
very
hazy
burnt
orange
the
off
white
foam
that
billows
up
to
crown
the
beer
hits
four
fingers
in
height
head
retention
is
very
good
but
the
lacing
left
behind
is
pretty
minimal
the
nose
has
plenty
of
caramel
and
fruity
esters
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
diacetyl
present
flavor
wise
dicetyl
is
a
bit
more
present
when
the
beers
cold
and
its
a
bit
overbearing
it
retreats
with
time
though
allowing
caramel
and
apple
led
fruity
esters
to
shine
through
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
warming
booziness
to
the
beer
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
carbonation
thats
just
a
hair
too
bubbly
and
active
its
definitely
a
minor
issue
though
i
dont
know
if
some
more
time
would
let
old
powderhouse
finish
cleaning
up
and
rounding
into
form
but
its
definitely
not
drinking
badly
right
now
overall
not
bad
the
booze
gets
a
bit
too
much
but
the
malts
are
nice
sweet
flavors
are
nice
hops
add
a
good
touch
as
well
that
also
doesnt
overpower
and
good
carb
etc
just
a
bit
too

a

is
lots
of
grape
clove
carmel

hard

taste
is
less
sweet
than
the
nose
would
lead
on
but
everything
from
the
nose
with
fermented
grapes
being
most
dominant
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
but
i
have
only
had
one
other
wheat
wine
from
smuttynose
and
that
drinks
closet
to
a
barleywine
then
this
body
is
thinner
than
you
would
expect
with
its
hefty
abv
plenty
of
life
not
that
dry
considering
the
flavors
and
surprisingly
drinkable
this
isnt
my
favorite
type
of
flavors
but
am
enjoying
anyway
poured
a
2
5
caramel
colored
head
with
long
life
the
body
is
a
deep
cloudy
sienna
tan
color
it
smells
of
malt
tropical
juices
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
quite
rich
with
sugar
butterscotch
some
malt
a
little
of
the
tropical
fruit
quite
a
long
finish
ive
got
to
say
its
a
little
alcoholic
quite
a
burn
to
it
and
im
not
averse
to
high
alcohol
beers
im
just
commenting
its
quite
noticeable
deceptively
drinkable
light
and
mildly
sweet
with
some
tartness
from
the
berry
flavor
to
counteract
i
wanted
another
after
the
first
o
well
an
interesting
wheatwine
if
there
ever
was
one
honestly
it
looks
and
tastes
like
the
worlds
biggest
witbier
like
someone
took
a
witbier
recipe
and
just
doubled
or
tripled
it
its
good
a
bit
simple
perhaps
more
complex
when
its
got
some
age
on
it
plenty
fine
as
is
nice
and
wheaty
and
fruity
let
this
one
warm
up
fully
its
much
nicer
that
way
o
so
many
great
things
going
on
for
this
beer
a
ton
of
complexity
warm
and
inviting
hard
to
pack
all
this
in
and
keep
it
in
balance
but
its
well
done
here
o
this
beer
reminds
me
like
a
muted
version
of
a
barleywine
as
you
can
taste
the
malty
flavors
but
it
doesnt
seem
as
heavy
on
the
body
as
the
wheat
lightens
things
up
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
taste
is
toasty
toffee
fairly
sweet
with
an
alcohol
bite
on
the
end
i
wish
it
was
lighter
on
the
malt
with
a
healthier
hop
dose
it
is
a
different
sort
of
wheatwine
than
the
lighter
colored
more
effervescent
variety
this
one
has
a
heavy
barleywine
feel
to
it
not
bad
but
i
likely
would
pass
it
up
on
a
store
shelf
o
good
stuff
almost
like
a
dessert
version
of
a
quadtripeldubbel
or
the
doppelbocks
o
its
a
good
rendition
of
the
style
but
i
just
think
this
style
is
setup
to
not
blow
people
away
d
this
was
a
nice
brew
with
nice
scent
and
taste
and
fantastic
body
the
finish
was
smooth
and
the
alcohol
was
really
well
hidden
so
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
i
wish
it
had
more
boldness
either
hoppy
or
sweet
instead
this
ended
up
being
nice
but
a
little
boring
age
may
help
mf
medium
bodied
a
little
slick
smooth
creaminess
warming
4
odd
beer
but
another
tasty
one
from
perennial
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
this
has
a
pale
golden
color
perfectly
clear
but
not
much
head
or
visible
carbonation
smells
quite
sweet
like
honey
and
wheat
malt
somehow
still
light
despite
its
obvious
gravity
and
alcohol
strength
i
smell
some
fruity
esters
too
maybe
even
berries
or
honeysuckle
or
something
lush
and
springy
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
residual
sugars
abound
and
its
subtle
malt
flavor
is
less
prominent
than
it
probably
should
be
although
i
am
admittedly
not
much
of
a
wheat
wine
connoisseur
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
out
until
the
end
and
the
flavor
is
actually
rather
pleasant
just
very
sweet
a
good
glass
to
share
smooth
in
the
feel
gentle
vibes
but
lacking
the
carbonation
that
i
need
in
a
beer
like
this
it
gets
heavy
as
a
result
and
starts
to
get
tough
to
drink
the
booze
comes
out
as
it
warms
and
it
can
really
get
you
smashed
if
you
dont
look
out
a
good
beer
from
perennial
maybe
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
some
others
but
a
unique
and
enjoyable
cold
weather
brew
rich
deep
brown
in
color
minimal
head
quickly
disappears
but
i
see
active
carbonation
bubbles
the
aroma
is
a
lush
inviting
dark
wheat
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
very
surprisingly
smooth
considering
the
strength
theres
an
earthiness
that
blends
with
the
carbonation
and
makes
its
presence
known
by
prickling
the
tongue
ive
had
a
handful
of
other
wheat
wines
and
they
havent
been
good
experiences
but
this
is
very
intriguing
and
inviting
theres
a
bit
of
a
dark
malt
and
buttery
cracker
refreshing
aftertaste
poured
a
lighter
brown
reddish
brown
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
and
had
a
strong
boozy
aroma
mixed
with
touches
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
notes
as
well
as
some
wheat
is
noticeable
the
wheat
helps
make
for
a
fuller
body
not
chewey
but
close
smooth
drinking
the
booze
is
noticeable
as
it
has
a
slightly
heavy
boozy
taste
not
quite
bourbonwoody
the
dark
fruits
like
plums
raisins
figs
are
in
there
touches
of
bitter
citric
hops
and
spice
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
balances
seems
to
be
slightly
off
as
the
finish
is
muddled
and
at
some
points
was
really
biting
alright
for
the
style
not
near
as
quaffable
as
harvest
dance
so
far
this
brewery
isnt
really
impressing
me
especially
a
pricey
as
they
were
at
brown
derby
overall
this
is
hella
dull
a
nice
beer
that
ill
appreciate
more
come
fall
a
really
good
wheat
wine
one
of
my
favorites
that
i
think
will
do
well
in
the
cellar
for
a
couple
years
it
does
a
much
better
job
of
hiding
its
alcohol
than
many
others
that
ive
tried
i
wish
that
expense
and
shipping
didnt
prevent
easier
access
to
this
but
im
happy
to
have
a
couple
more
fans
of
the
style
should
try
it
ifwhen
possible
o
this
is
pretty
good
but
its
a
bit
onenoted
d
hard
to
get
past
the
initial
alcohol
tastecarbonation
sting
decent
beer
on
the
finish
but
the
initial
notes
are
below
average
o
its
actually
quite
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
i
am
by
no
means
an
expert
when
it
comes
to
wheatwines
but
compared
to
previous
beers
i
have
had
in
the
style
this
is
actually
near
the
top
memories
of
hitchhikers
guide
flowing
back
for
some
reason
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
slightly
hazy
sunset
amber
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
wet
grass
flowers
light
perfumey
orange
peel
and
lightlytoasted
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
grapefruit
peel
the
alcohol
isnt
quite
as
present
as
id
expected
from
other
encounters
with
this
brewery
which
is
a
nice
bit
of
surprise
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
a
sortakinda
fluid
feel
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
a
kinda
limp
wheatwine
one
with
little
character
and
a
subsequently
bland
flavor
poured
on
tap
in
a
snifter
appearance
is
a
slightly
hazy
with
a
dark
golden
hue
minimal
head
with
some
spotty
lacing
nose
is
full
of
wheat
and
bread
rich
herbal
hops
come
next
with
a
bit
of
booziness
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
up
front
with
heavy
wheat
character
and
burn
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
light
carbonation
overall
a
little
one
note
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
sticky
as
i
thought
it
would
be
you
want
to
sip
this
if
only
because
of
the
slight
boozy
finish
overall
a
good
beer
the
world
needed
a
wheatwine
like
this
one
o
this
is
yet
another
really
good
beer
from
perennial
overall
initially
i
thought
this
one
was
boozy
but
it
mellows
out
forming
a
wheateine
unlike
any
other
i
have
had
very
nice
version
of
the
style
poured
from
tap
at
bridge
in
stl
pours
a
slight
amber
golden
syrup
color
not
much
head
but
its
there
smells
off
toffee
and
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
fantastic
sweet
toffee
malty
booze
slight
vanilla
and
molasses
so
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
high
abv
really
liked
this
brew
and
my
fav
of
the
style
for
sure
well
worth
a
try
but
a
bottle
is
on
the
spendy
side
notes
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
very
few
stuff
from
perennial
reaching
me
and
while
all
ive
tasted
felt
quality
this
one
might
be
the
one
that
will
make
the
bigger
dent
in
my
memory
so
far
the
flavor
on
the
other
hand
is
excellent
wheat
crispness
and
lots
of
fruit
esters
up
front
as
expected
but
the
high
point
is
the
carameltoffee
gooeyness
that
ensues
deliciousmore
like
a
barleywine
with
a
touch
of
wheat
than
the
contrary
but
im
perfectly
fine
with
that
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
on
the
palate
but
comes
off
as
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
the
fine
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
wheatwine
and
is
right
up
there
with
new
hollands
pilgrims
dole
for
my
favorites
within
the
style
nicely
done
perennial
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
forgettable
overall
it
is
good
but
doesnt
shine
in
any
specific
aspect
i
would
def
like
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
even
for
being
over
6
mo
old
it
still
would
benefit
greatly
from
a
more
dominant
citrus
punch
i
cannot
recommend
seeking
this
out
even
for
fans
of
the
style
as
you
can
probably
get
a
better
example
locally
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
highly
crafted
ale
the
abv
is
nonexistent
even
at
closetoroom
temps
which
is
commendable
just
lacks
the
necessary
pop
for
a
higher
rating
massive
sleeping
giant
of
a
beer
it
took
a
few
sips
to
really
fall
into
this
beer
and
see
the
complexities
open
up
very
mellow
the
10
does
not
fully
show
until
the
end
a
lovely
wheat
wine
yet
another
one
that
may
show
this
style
being
more
malt
forward
which
is
fine
by
me
flavor
has
some
slight
citrus
otherwise
a
mellow
hearty
caramel
malt
and
burly
wheat
presence
and
a
light
herbal
bitterness
not
much
definitive
character
here
but
its
alright
and
drinkable
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
considering
the
10
abv
a
citrusy
easydrinking
version
of
a
rarely
attempted
style
i
have
been
more
than
impressed
with
this
brewery
so
far
and
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
their
offeringsi
just
wish
i
could
buy
them
off
the
shelves
in
san
diego
overall
this
was
my
first
time
trying
a
wheatwine
so
i
really
had
no
comparisons
to
make
here
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
it
and
i
will
seek
it
out
again
drink
this
was
a
unique
wheatwine
and
i
didnt
really
think
it
was
all
that
special
i
think
it
was
getting
a
bit
fatigued
at
the
tasting
at
this
point
as
well
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
quite
possible
one
of
my
favorites
in
this
style
the
alcohol
is
hidden
wonderfully
and
the
sweetness
is
just
perfect
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
pours
which
i
would
really
never
want
from
this
style
normally
recommend
oseriously
good
example
of
the
style
some
of
this
is
currently
aging
in
bourbon
barrels
at
the
wine
and
cheese
place
and
i
cant
wait
o
very
impressed
with
this
wheatwine
perennial
has
been
releasing
some
great
brews
and
i
keep
looking
forward
to
their
development
this
is
an
exceptional
wheat
wine
i
fully
plan
to
get
more
of
this
and
both
trade
and
age
it
because
of
this
bottle
im
going
to
order
more

this

highlighted

wow
pretty

an
almost

hits
your

as
well

washes
away
in
a

woody
notes
subtle

again
and
a
toasted

backbone
support
all
these
transitions
occurring
on
your
palate
smooth
in
mouth
initially
but
kept
with
a
slight
edge
thanks
to
a
slow
steady
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
the
aftertaste
is
like
candied
fruit
with
the
pineapple
apricot
orange
peel
and
other
sweet
notes
coming
off
with
a
slightly
candied
character
its
nice
the
finish
is
slightly
cloying
but
again
the
carbonation
cleans
up
just
enough
to
keep
things
smooth
and
friendly
the
increased
abv
is
hidden
very
well
throughout
with
the
only
nod
given
in
the
initial
warmth
you
get
solid
brew
wow

overall
this
beer
gets
dominated
by
the
aged
characteristics
tons
of
oranges
and
spices
all
over
the
aroma
and
taste
the
wheatwine
of
the
beer
seems
to
get
primarily
lost
some
interesting
things
going
on
but
overall
just
okay
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
maybe
slightly
unbalanced
and
it
is
drinking
pretty

i
got
to
try
this
but
its
not
really
my
thing
very
sweet
and
confused
between
an
old
dipa
and
a
barleywine
overall
another
outstanding
beer
from
pipeworks
overall
a
very
well
done
wheatwine
great
combo
of
strong
and
sweet
malts
along
with
very
tasty
and
bitter
hops
alcohol
plays
a
large
part
and
goes
nicely
with
everything
else
in
the
beer
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
really
liked
the
nose
as
i
thought
the
fruity
and
caramel
malts
worked
really
well
with
fresh
citrus
hops
worth
checking
out
would
like
to
have
it
again
sometime
o
well
this
isnt
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
wheatwines
really
more
of
a
wheatcentric
dipa
and
a
dipa
in
the
pw
style
at
that
but
as
someone
who
enjoys
dipas
i
still
found
the
beer
to
quite
enjoyable
a
bit
hot
for
my
liking
but
not
bad
m
little
sweet
medium
body
noticeable
alcohol
nice
carbonation
an
american
strong
for
sure
and
a
rich
wheat
malt
make
this
the
wine
sitting
on
the
fence
tween
barleywine
and
dipa
expect
richness
and
depth
big
on
hop
and
big
on
booze
to
confound
your
session
you
not

this

mostly

notes
low
level
of

full

smooth
with
a
touch

a

bomb
for
sure
this
brew
has
just
as
much
in
common
with
most
dipas
as
it
does
with
other
wheatwines
overall
this
one
was
a
weird
one
to
rate
according
to
style
this
is
not
a
very
well
executed
beer
just
overall
enjoyment
though
this
is
a
classic
hop
bomb
from
pw
bright

this
one
will
do
the
job
for
you
this
might
not
be
what
id
reach
for
when
i
want
a
wheatwine
but
i
think
its
delicious
its
almost

an

a

o
its
alright
a
bit
pricey
im
not
super
impressed
with
it
to
be
honest
o
this
beer
is
different
from
the
other
wheat
wines
that
i
have
enjoyed
as
i
mentioned
it
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
which
i
happen
to
like
it
is
good
but
different
cultivate
the
craft
oklahomacraftbeer
overall
a
quality
beer
from
bells
and
a
bit
unique
as
well
bordering
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
liking
but
really
it
isnt
overdone
at
all
worth
a
try
o
its
good
to
be
surprised
once
in
a
while
i
definitely
wasnt
expecting
an
imperialized
hefeweizen
as
a
rule
of
thumb
im
going
to
compare
this
to
other
weizenbocks
and
in
that
regard
it
falls
a
little
short
still
pretty
good
still
worth
drinking
again
just
not
worth
buying
6packs
of
the
beer
is
the
color
of
a
fading
sunset
somewhere
between
yellow
and
orange
fairly
hazy
with
a
gargantuan
pure
white
head
lasting
retention
and
ample
lacing
the
aroma
offers
oranges
grapefruits
juice
sweet
citrus
candies
yeast
the
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
orange
candies
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
alcohol
is
present
but
doesnt
hinder
enjoyment
creamy
feel
with
a
light
prickle
from
the
carbonation
solid
more
of
andoublel
hefe
to
the
senses
than
a
wheatwine
but
a
very
good
beer
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
them
with
the
socal
weather
lately
an
excellent
strong
ale
that
brings
together
elements
of
three
great
beer
regions
hefeweizen
fruity
vibes
from
germany
wit
beer
type
belgian
yeast
and
the
alcoholic
warmth
and
cereal
grain
profile
of
an
english
strong
ale
or
barleywine
fusion
is
fun
and
in
this
case
quite
successful
the
wheat
malt
is
very
light
and
some
more
toasty
grains
bring
sweetness
the
yeast
is
herbal
and
fruity
almost
like
a
hefe
i
get
a
touch
of
banana
in
here
i
also
get
some
honey
and
floral
characters
especially
in
the
finish
a
very
clean
drinking
brew
that
is
somehow
really
light
and
bright
in
the
mouth
despite
being
so
large
not
sure
if
this
fits
what
i
consider
a
traditional
wheat
wine
but
its
moving
in
that
direction
light
and
airy
but
does
not
improve
with
warmth
funny
esters
come
out
and
make
it
a
little
composty
but
in
general
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
and
a
cool
style
hybrid
i
would
buy
this
if
it
were
available
in
denver
taste
is
rich
and
fullbodied
on
the
palate
with
big
heaps
of
sweet
grain
malts
and
a
sticky
hoppy
bitterness
underneath
the
weizen
tones
this
is
a
very
bold
wheat
ale
effectively
an
imperial
weizen

wheat
love
is
a
very
nice
brew
it
has
a
lot
going
on
and
it
surprised
me
at
how
good
it
really
is
a
real
complex
beer
in
terms
of
the
way
it
was
made
with
a
load
of
different
yeast
strains
this
is
a
fine
wheatwine
and
i
just
bought
a
few
more
as
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
sitting
in
the
store
this
long
bells
yet
again
did
a
very
class
job
at
crafting
this
unique
wheat
beer
gem
if
you
enjoy
wheat
beer
i
insist
on
grabbing
at

one
of

i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
it
may
start
to
be
a
little
filling
after
that
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
the
alcohol
was
hidden
good
level
of
carbonation
a
little
more
warming
than
i
would
like
a
double

i
dont
know
why
they
wouldnt
market
this
as
a
imperial

this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
moreish
palate
with
medium
body
and
suggestions
of

its

this

i
dont
really
like
a

well

i
couldnt
quite
find
anything
wheaty
about
this
brew
but
i
still
found
it
enjoyable
aroma
of
pine
and
citrus
tastes
like
malt
with
marmalade
and
bitter

not
much
alcohol
is
detected
over
the

finish
ah
finally
having
another

its
been
too
long
kids
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
topped
by
a
halffinger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
white
bread
orange
peel
mild
booze
and
a
hint
of
cream
the
taste
ups
the
booze
ante
along
with
the
requisite
burn
then
theres
a
sense
of
off
cointreau
being
suffocated
by
wet
white
bread
slathered
in
country
crock
then
add
a
sprig
of
mint
and
astringent
pine
resin
ooph
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
this
was
just
an
unpleasant
wheatwimake
that
an
unpleasant
beer
in
general
no
nuance
no
real
niceness
this
seems
rather
rough
for
a
wheatwine
overall
this
is
a
terrific
beer
with
huge
flavor
though
i
dont
care
for
the
marketing
shtick
focus
on
making
good
beer
not
denigrating
and
stereotyping
people
mouthfeel
is
super
thick
mild
carbonation
along
with
the
rich
body
make
this
a
big
beer
overall
one
of
the

from

no

killed
it
with

o
a
complete
miss
based
on
the
aroma
i
was
not
surprised
to
taste
a
beer
that
was
very
sweet
while
its
full
bodied
and
its
alcohol
well
hidden
this
beer
is
much
sweeter
than
i
prefer
all
i
taste
are

unfortunately
falls
a

short
for
me
between

there
are
just

many

dont

in

opinion

im
really
glad
i
made
the
trip
back
to

to
check
out
this

the
recommendations
and
positive
words
arent
just
jargon
this
beer
is
seriously
awesome
one
of
the
most
drinkable
13
abv
beers
ive
encountered
with
great
balance
between
rye
whiskey
warmth
and
caramel
malty
sweetness
not
the
kind
of
beer
youd
take
to
the
dome
but
in
relatively
sized
smaller
pours
its
magical
rich
maltiness
the
wheat
comes
through
unfortunately
so
does
the
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
phenolics
hopefully
this
is
just
a
single
batch
that
got
away
i
can
give
it
credit
for
what
i
can
see
it
was
intended
to
be
but
the
defect
holds
me
back
from
going
further
my

however
liked
it

at

o

brew
i
will
be
spending
more
time
with
pilgrims
dole
this
winter
than
i
have
in
the
past
ive
had
one
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
wheat
wine
and
this
one
is
noticeably
superior
to
that
one
it
has
many
of
the
same
characteristics
as
founders
backwoods
bastard
but
the
bready
notes
are
dialed
down
and
the
wheat
imparts
a
softer
feel
and
a
faint
hint
of
tartness
the
next
time
i
strike
out
trying
to
get
backwoods
bastard
ill
pick
up
this
instead
and
be
just
fine
one
of
the
beer
guys
at
the
bottle
shop
where
i
frequent
made
the
comment
that
if
this
stuff
had
a
three
floyds
label
on
the
bottle
people
would
do
crazy
things
to
get
it
he
might
be
right
about
that
o
this
is
just
amazing
so
dangerously
drinkable
and
enticingly
delicious
im
going
to
be
seeking
out
a
lot
more
barrelaged
wheatwines
after
this
this
is
an
excellent
beer
will
be
buying
more
o
i
think
its
pretty
good
not
one
your
gonna
slam
down
unless
your
a
shot
person
looks
real
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
solid
ba
ale
imo
this
was
a
gift
from
fellow
ba
jzeilinger
thanks
again
bro
o
a
solid
beer
overall
not
terribly
complex
and
a
little
too
boozy
but
still
good
o
might
be
the
first
barrelaged
wheatwine
that
i
have
tried
and
it
worked
really
well
somewhat
tempering
the
sweetness
of
wheatwines
and
adding
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
good
sipping
beer
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
o
really
good
a
surprise
to
just
find
on
the
shelf
never
hearing
of
it
before
highly
recommend
trying
it
of
you
like
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
and
who
doesnt
o
this
is
an
impressive
barrelaged
wheat
wine
the
malt
bill
here
is
complex
and
hearty
a
fantastic
showcase
of
different
malt
flavors
in
fact
everything
is
really
top
notch
until
the
finish
this
bottle
has
at
least
a
year
on
it
and
the
finish
is
still
way
too
boozy
and
hot
it
fails
to
stick
the
landing
but
that
doesnt
diminish
the
fact
that
this
is
a
strong
wheat
wine
regardless
pilgrims
dole
is
however
the
rare
instance
where
barrel
aging
diminished
as
opposed
to
improved
the
beer
i
actually
went
into
this
a
bit
skeptical
but
it
served
very
well
as
an
after
dinner
dessert
and
an
over
all
great
beer
bottled
in
2013
light
in
body
caramel
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
huge
vanilla
smell
in
the
front
caramel
sweetness
toffee
bourbon
and
burnt
sugar
basically
tasted
like
a
bba
english
barleywine
except
maybe
a
little
less
sweet
slightly
under
carbonated
took
a
little
away
from
the
taste
really
well
done
wheatwine
that
i
was
happy
to
drink
but
would
have
loved
to
have
had
this
aged
i
think
2
years
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
o
probably
my
first
wheat
wine
but
i
enjoyed
it
completely
reminds
me
a
bit
of
backwoods
bastard
or
north
coast
old
stock
ive
had
this
in
the
past
but
its
been
a
while
very
complex
beer
of
course
its
pretty
hot
but
great
esters
and
bourbon
character
may
need
to
age
a
bottle
dark
brown
in
color
with
just
a
faint
trace
of
white
foam
barely
covering
any
of
the
top
of
the
beer
faint
aroma
of
pale
wheat
is
present
brussels
lacing
the
body
is
somewhat
thickbut
is
much
less
formidible
than
the
founders
sweet
repute
i
had
just
finished
the
taste
is
dark
wheat
and
fades
very
quickly
this
is
an
easy
going
wheatwine
if
there
is
such
a
thing
overall
i
may
have
jumped
the
gun
with
this
one
it
seems
an
excellent
candidate
for
aging
ill
get
a
large
water
back
and
nurse
this
through
the
night
and
enjoy
but
im
worried
about
having
it
near
an
open
flame
overall
at
10
a
four
pack
i
feel
like
this
was
a
pricing
mistake
by
the
store
i
got
it
from
but
who
knows
this
is
a
steal
its
no
backwoods
bastard
and
technically
its
not
even
the
same
style
but
the
taste
and
characteristics
are
quite
similar
if
this
is
more
readily
available
to
you
or
if
you
just
havent
given
it
a
shot
yet
please
go
for
it
its
a
huge
sweet
complicated
beast
for
what
may
as
well
be
a
bargain
basement
price
cheers
i
dont
generally
jump
up
and
down
about
new
holland
but
they
impressed
me
quite
a
lot
with
this
one
o
a
i
might
have
to
try
the
offereings
ive
had
from
these
guys
again
just
based
on
this
at
least
the
dragons
milk
final
thoughts
wow
what
a
big
beer
im
no
stranger
to
barleywines
and
big
abvs
but
pilgrims
dole
really
takes
the
cake
for
being
like
well
drinking
a
cake
definitely
a
sipper
which
is
good
because
it
allows
the
flavors
to
develop
as
it
warms
nice
use
of
bourbon
barrels
this
one
is
only
for
the
serious
beer
geek
you
have
been
warned
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
i
imagine
it
ages
quite
nicely
as
well
overall
i
am
not
sure
what
to
think
maybe
they
should
have
just
bourbon
barreled
the
whole
beer
the
finish
product
seems
good
but
it
could
be
better
its
like
the
first
time
you
ate
scuppernongs
or
sauteed
veal
brains
and
you
sat
staring
at
them
even
while
understanding
their
relation
to
more
familiar
foodstuffs
trying
to
quantify
or
appropriately
grasp
their
dynamic
utterly
postmodern
approach
to
your
concepts
of
consumption
while
it
is
a
jarring
enlightening
experience
at
some
point
though
you
are
obliged
to
simply
be
grateful
for
the
paradigm
shift
and
carry
on
addressing
your
new
discovery
o
this
beer
is
quite
interesting
for
a
wheatwine
and
isnt
overly
difficult
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
isnt
that
noticeable
in
the
taste
it
also
has
nice
vanilla
and
toffee
flavors
without
tasting
exactly
like
bourbon
or
alcohol
o
very
good
but
was
more
on
the
verge
of
a
barleywine
than
a
ww
imo
either
way
it
was
smooth
tasty
and
the
bb
was
awesome
o
new
to
the
style
but
would
try
again
is
it
great
no
but
worth
a
shot
give
it
try
if
you
like
the
style
cheers
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
toffee
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
a
nice
effort
from
new
holland
overall
tasty
barrelaged
wheatwine
well
put
together
and
the
bourbon
barrel
definitely
shines
here
as
i
would
expect
from
new
holland
really
tasty
and
powerful
ale
good
sipper
and
great
flavor
overall
its
defintely
not
a
complex
beer
but
the
flavors
are
quite
nice
id
definitely
revisit
this
beer
o
very
easy
drinker
considering
the
11
4
abv
overall
very
impressed
and
a
very
good
wheatwine
would
definitely
consider
aging
a
bottle
or
two
for
a
couple
years
overall
pilgrims
dole
is
a
very
easy
drinking
wheatwine
especially
considering
its
11
4
abvam
sure
the
almost
3years
of
aging
played
a
big
part
in
that
nice
job
new
holland
happy
thanksgiving
overall
i
like
this
way
more
than
i
expected
it
is
a
pretty
solid
barleywine
and
ill
get
it
again
the
only
problem
from
a
review
standpoint
is
that
is
is
not
a
very
impressive
wheatwine
it
wants
more
wheatbeer
character
to
be
to
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
wheat
wine
it
tasted
pretty
similar
to
when
i
had
it
a
couple
years
ago
but
the
barrel
aspects
stuck
out
more
then
i
remember
and
that
worked
nicely
with
this
beer
this
beer
has
ok
drinkability
it
isnt
that
smooth
and
it
has
a
good
amount
of
warming
alcohol
this
beer
is
a
sipper
plain
and
simple
one
is
just
the
right
amount
i
dont
think
i
have
it
in
me
to
drink
two
the
sweetness
would
be
way
too
much
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
how
complex
it
was
and
how
well
the
mouthfeel
suited
this
beer
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
it
was
a
little
intimidating
at
first
but
once
i
got
used
to
it
it
wasnt
that
bad
i
just
wished
it
was
toned
down
a
notch
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
not
often
its
a
once
in
a
while
treat
and
its
pretty
expensive
but
i
feel
like
its
worth
it
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
your
a
wheatwine
fan
or
like
high
octane
beers
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
much
like
i
remember
with
just
a
little
more
barrel
aspect
that
only
adds
to
the
complexity
i
am
a
big
fan
of
wheatwines
but
its
a
style
i
dont
find
often
and
i
wish
more
brewerys
explored
this
style
new
holland
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
i
like
it
more
the
dragons
milk
good
job
guys
this
is
one
high
octane
and
good
tasting
wheatwine
i
deem
it
worthy
2014
edit
its
been
a
little
over
a
year
and
half
since
ive
last
had
this
vintage
but
i
just
pulled
one
out
of
the
cellar
for
my
birthday
and
its
tasting
pretty
good
its
still
fairly
boozy
and
a
little
hot
but
theres
some
great
and
rich
caramel
and
oaky
flavors
coming
through
that
stick
out
more
then
they
did
when
this
beer
was
fresh
i
still
think
age
could
help
and
hopefully
tone
down
some
of
the
booze
but
as
it
stands
right
now
i
think
its
a
4
4
i
might
wait
a
year
to
ty
the
other
bottle
in
my
cellar
o
a
tasty
wheatwine
with
nice
barrel
notes
id
definitely
buy
it
again
really
enjoy
this
beer
overall
ready
to
drink
right
out
of
the
gate
no
aging
necessary
very
dangerous
for
what
the
abv
is
great
beer
a
much
more
traditional
barleywine
take
on
a
wheatwine
im
sure
3
years
of
aging
has
calmed
this
one
down
a
good
bit
ill
give
the
other
bottle
i
have
another
23
to
see
if
the
bourbon
fades
and
allows
a
little
more
sweetness
through
far
from
my
favorite
wheatwine
but
certainly
worth
a
try
o
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
overpowers
the
base
beer
and
makes
this
somewhat
onedimensional
o
quite
enjoyable
though
a
bit
of
a
slow
sipper
a
nice
alternative
to
the
bourbon
barrel
stouts
that
are
everywhere
now
id
like
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
and
save
them
for
special
occasions
the
body
on
this
is
firmly
entrenched
in
the
realm
of
mediumheavy
it
flows
easily
due
to
the
carbonation
isnt
sticky
or
drying
but
is
definitely
a
little
heavy
to
be
considered
refreshing
not
that
i
write
that
as
a
bad
thing
this
one
feels
as
alcoholic
as
it
is
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
however
it
is
very
rich
and
indulgent
i
can
only
do
beers
like
this
one
a
few
times
a
year
this
beer
is
absolutely
exceptional
12
wheatwhine
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
balances
perfect
for
the
right
amount
of
booziness
and
goes
down
real
smooth
i
purchased
some
old
2005
bottles
from
new
holland
and
also
got
a
couple
bombers
i
think
i
will
have
the
05
sooner
than
later
and
will
let
one
bomber
cellar
for
a
good
while
and
see
what
happens
with
it
huge
thumbs
up
to
this
brew
o
good
wheat
wine
but
could
use
some
time
in
the
cellar
to
take
some
of
the
heat
off
may
buy
another
bottle
and
let
it
sit
for
a
year
overall
good
beer
too
much
alcohol
though
the
aroma
disguises
it
a
bit
i
feel
but
you
can
definitely
taste
it
o
big
strong
and
boozy
next
time
i
open
a
bomber
of
this
ill
share
it
with
a
friend
too
much
for
one
person
having
a
hard
time
finishing
it
very
malty
sweet
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
bottle
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevalent
overall
an
interesting
beer
very
clean
and
drinkable
doesnt
really
hint
at
the
relatively
high
abv
i
want
to
age
one
just
to
see
what
happens
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
the
wheat
was
less
pronounced
than
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
but
i
still
thought
it
was
a
really
nice
and
interesting
beer
i
definitely
think
this
beer
is
worth
trying
out
at
least
once
i
would
buy
it
again
though
overall
nice
but
simple
and
occasionally
overpowering
as
in
the
burnt
flavor
in
the
finish
its
good
but
lacks
a
certain
refinement
not
mind
blowing
and
it
can
become
one
note
at
sometimes
but
its
pretty
enjoyable
nice
beer
to
sip
on
and
becomes
even
better
as
it
warms
up
im
glad
i
picked
a
bottle
of
this
up
i
had
eyeballed
in
it
bombers
for
the
last
year
unaware
it
was
barrel
aged
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
it
pours
a
luscious
caramel
color
with
very
thin
lacing
theres
a
very
present
booziness
that
runs
throughoutthe
aroma
the
taste
and
the
finish
but
when
drinking
its
balanced
or
or
complimented
by
a
sweetness
and
a
real
wheated
smoothness
theres
a
definite
bourbonbarrelaged
spirits
note
to
this
as
well
but
its
not
the
dominating
presence
in
three
words
smooth
sweet
strong
d
and
o
this
beer
has
left
a
great
impression
on
me
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
have
passed
up
time
and
time
again
wont
make
that
mistake
very
drinkable
great
oak
and

awesome
sweetness
a

thick

it
feeling
a

in

another

overall
was
not
sure
which
style
this
beer
was
at
first
ba
says
its
a
wheatwine
and
the
bottle
says
a
barleywine
made
with
wheat
i
would
say
its
a
barleywine
with
some
wheat
aftertaste
not
too
bad
i
am
new
to
the
wheatwine
style
and
this
is
only
my
second
beer
of
this
style
i
have
drank
overall
ok
this
would
be
a
solid
b
beer
if
it
was
a
barleywine
however
if
you
are
using
wheat
i
want
to
taste
it
there
is
practically
no
wheat
flavours
in
this

i
have

this
is
still
a
rather
nice
beer
though
it
is
just
a
tad
too
sweet
probably
my
favorite
wheatwine
ive
had
not
that
ive
had
many
d
well
its
not
bad
i
can
say
that
not
bad
its
not
great
though
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
i
wanted
those
big
wheat
flavors
with
a
heft
of
banana
to
it
but
this
beer
doesnt
have
it
this
is
absolutely
more
of
barleywine
rather
than
a
wheatwine
i
am
just
not
getting
the
wheat
on
the
level
i
should
be
ah
well
i
was
bound
to
run
into
a
wheatwine
i
wasnt
too
keen
on
and
this
is
it
i
can
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
making
me
tap
my
toes
or
anyhing
meh
taste
is
very
sharp
and
strong
with
light
carbonation
very
sweet
and
boozy
however
for
a
wheatwine
its
surprisingly
fruity
and
floral
its
pretty
decent
notes
one
of
the
best
probably
the
best
tasting
of
the
style
ive
had
and
something
worth
revisiting
often
this
by
far
is
not
my
first
try
and
it
does
not
disappoint
a
bit
in
any
of
them
some
have
mentioned
how
interesting
it
might
be
to
see
this
oak
aged
which
i
believe
they
have
do
or
have
done
in
the
past
and
i
can
totally
see
the
potential
of
that
for
me
this
has
a
vanilla
undertone
resemblance
that
could
be
tremendous
in
the
right
barrel
it
may
also
lean
quite
a
bit
to
barley
wine
characteristics
with
wheat
notes
which
after
all
is
what
a
wheat
wine
is
sort
of
meant
to
be
but
being
unorthodox
cant
never
be
a
problem
with
a
brew
this
pleasing
notes
reminds
me
of
a
very
strong
scotch
ale
personally
love
big
sweet
rich
ales
with
high
abvs
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
one
and
forgot
what
ive
been
missing
out
on
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
tangy
wheat
caramel
toffee
and
alcohol
this
smells
like
a
wheaty
barleywine
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
some
nice
heat
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
love
to
drink
again
d
due
to
how
sweet
this
is
its
a
dessert
quality
beer
that
is
exceedingly
rich
and
sugarysweet
however
the
flavors
are
good
and
interesting
nothing
is
shy
within
this
beer
just
simply
robust
and
boozy
definitely
serious
abv
share
this
with
a

or
two
dr
it
is
best
to
consume
this

or
a

chilled

beer
pours

the

theres
dark

raisins

spice
booze
and
an

taste
are
all
noticable
im
pretty
sure
this
beer
isnt
oak
aged
but
there
seems
to
be
that
kind
of
flavor
in
this
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
and
thick
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
and
its
definitely
a
sipper
because
of
the
alcohol
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
arrived
in
a
nh
tulip
glass
and
was
dark
copper
in
color
with

head
had
a
fruity
sweet
nose
that
reminds
me
plums
and
figs
with
a
slight
spiciness
maybe
im
not
that
experienced
but
this
tastes
a
lot
like
a
barleywine
to
me
scarily
drinkable
for
being
10
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
a
twoinch
head
developed
offwhite
to
heavy
cream
colored
with

larger
bubbles
the
head
persists
for
a
while
the
nose
is
deep
rich
nutty
burnt
almond
notes
the
body
is
full
and
rich
with
lingering
warmth
the
flavor
profile
makes
me
think
caramel
and
hotspice
candies
although
it
has
zero
scovilles
for
sure
the
flavor
profile
speaks
to
richness
complexity
and
multidimensionality
the
head
dissipates
during
consumption
but
leaves
a
lovely
intricate
belgian
lace
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
balanced
well
against
the
body
i
am
warming
as
i
write
this
and
will
return
to
this
ale
when
the
cold
weather
reappears
serve
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
particularly
stews
braises
and
bold
etouffees
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
rather
than
a
session
beer
the
ale
is
described
as
a
wheat
wine
and
definitely
has
barleywine
characteristics
the
expected
wheat
characteristics
are
however
not
evident
d
pretty
decent
for
the
abv
its
a
decent
sipper
it
makes
for
a
good
nightcap
overall
this
beer
is
a
sipper
very
boozy
as
i
have
mentioned
a
few
times
already
i
am
glad
i
am
not
drinking
this
entire
bomber
by
myself
i
had
trouble
finishing
a
bomber
of
this
i
feel
like
four
packs
of
this
would
be
alot
easier
to
handle
this
is
a
very
decadent
beerits
like
drinking
a
dessert
for
my
first
wheatwinei
think
its
pretty
solid
its
a
good
change
of
pace
from
normal
barleywinesthe
wheat
definitely
adds
a
different
flavor
profile
to
the
beer
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
drinkability
is
about
as
good
as
expected
for
such
a
good
beer
overall
a
solid
beer
a
little
too
much
like
a
barleywine
for
me
a
good
one
when
i
was
expecting
something
different
notes
technically
my
first
wheatwine
but
it
tastes
so
much
like
a
barleywine
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
really
just
that
it
would
be
great
to
try
some
other
wheatwines
d
this
was
only
my
second
wheatwine
so
i
dont
have
a
large
frame
of
reference
for
the
style
i
will
say
that
while
i
appreciated
this
brew
it
is
not
something
i
could
drink
much
of
in
a
sitting
it
was
a
struggle
to
finish
the
bomber
this
grew
on
me
like
most
of
the
better
barleywines
do
and
i
would
give
it
another
shot
if
i
saw
it
again
next
winter
fair
complexity
and
interesting
enough
now
at
least
i
have
something
to
compare
future
wheatwines
to
conclusion
rich
sweet
satisfying
to
the
max
d
enjoyed
this
just
a
little
too
sweet
and
in
need
of
more
balance
worth
another
try
d
my
first
wheat
wine
it
was
very
interesting
and
enjoyed
it
more
personally
than
barley
wine
the
abv
knocks
the
drinkability
a
bit
blipped
young
pilgrims
by
the
shins
the
body
is
big
and
has
a
slight
under
attenuated
feel
to
it
this
might
be
more
from
the
sweetness
but
just
leaves
a
lingering
sweetness
that
is
unpleasant
carbonation
is
very
light
which
doesnt
help
either
overall
i
am
a
bit
demanding
on
wheatwines
but
there
very
distinct
issues
with
the
sweetness
hops
and
yeast
issues
that
could
be
improved
on
but
i
think
would
age
nicely
22oz
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
a
surprisingly
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
decent
diminishing
eggshell
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
fruit
the
taste
was
a
nice
complex
blend
of
caramel
and
brown
malts
blending
nicely
with
the
familiar
sweet
fruit
character
of
most
wheat
beers
the
beer
is
fairly
heavy
with
low
carbonation
but
is
still
rather
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
it
certainly
achieves
the
difficult
task
of
making
a
barley
wine
at
least
an
altered
form
of
one
enjoyable
on
a
summerlike
night
i
am
hoping
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
here
because
this
one
just
isnt
very
pleasant
to
me
nothing
like
terrapins
and
not
something
id
likely
pick
up
again
i
remember
having
a
conversation
about
this
beer
and
everyone
was
convinced
its
barrel
aged
but
it
didnt
say
it
anywhere
except
on
the
packaging
from
archer
liqours
overall
i
am
not
familiar
with
wheatwine
as
a
style
and
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
taste
i
am
perceiving
dont
think
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
this
poured
a
clear
cherry
wood
color
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
fresh
cut
whole
grain
wheat
with
cherry
and
honey
and
raisin
along
with
a
some
alcohol
and
perhaps
some
oak
it
tasted
like
fresh
whole
wheat
honey
dried
cherries
baked
apples
a
bit
of
papaya
odd
and
some
alcohol
it
was
fairly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
salty
aftertaste
overall
this
was
definitely
a
unique
beer
with
a
nice
prominent
wheat
character
it
had
a
delicate
but
big
flavor
great
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
moderately
so
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
quite
rewarding
there
were
a
lot
of
different
elements
to
the
flavor
some
of
which
seemed
a
bit
out
of
place
im
not
sure
if
they
would
all
blend
better
with
age
otherwise
this
was
a
well
constructed
and
enjoyable
brew
the
carbonation
is
on
the
subtle
side
which
is
correct
for
the
style
and
the
body
is
full
while
dodging
syrupy
levels
it
is
rich
though
and
while
i
appreciate
the
earthiness
im
only
on
board
for
so
long
overall
very
good
d
a
slow
sipper
because
of
the
heat
from
the
abv
drinkability
a
good
value
for
the
price
and
i
like
their
take
on
the
style
a
lot
a
sipper
you
could
deal
with
for
hours
by
yourself
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
rich
aroma
with
toffee
caramel
floral
hops
fruit
and
bourbon
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
comes
and
goes
in
stages
of
tasty
malty
and
astringent
the
palate
is
smooth
with
an
astringent
aftertaste
overall
its
good
but
has
some
strange
taste
qualities
i
guess
this
one
isnt
bad
its
kind
of
werid
it
is
sweet
yet
there
is
a
distinct
hop
bitterness
and
earthy
hop
flavor
full
bodied
and
sticky
and
chewy
sweet
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
isnt
really
that
bad
d
a
very
solid
wheatwine
probably
my
favorite
so
far
the
beer
pours
a
copper
amber
color
with
fair
head
retention
and
minimal
lacing
while
the
beer
doesnt
look
to
be
anything
special
the
nose
on
this
bad
boy
immediately
got
my
attention
there
is
a
nice
interplay
of
vanilla
bourbon
butterscotch
and
burnt
sugar
leading
one
to
expect
a
pretty
rich
beer
this
beer
does
not
diappoint
on
the
palate
and
is
absolute
delicious
barrel
aging
is
quite
apparent
in
this
beer
giving
this
beer
a
dry
flavor
panoply
of
butterscotch
bitter
chocolate
and
light
vanilla
chocolate
the
beer
also
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
coming
across
as
very
smooth
soft
and
long
drinkability
is
really
pretty
good
in
this
high
abv
beer
though
im
not
sure
id
ever
want
to
have
more
then
one
at
a
sitting
excellent
drinkability
very
smooth
for
a
high
abv
definitely
my
favorite
offering
from
new
holland
and
a
style
i
would
love
to
try
more
of
an
enjoyable
beer
but
also
one
that
should
be
sipped
the
alcohol
isnt
well
perceived
so
it
could
be
easy
to
drink
this
one
too
quickly
one
for
the
hop
heads
recommended
very
good
beer
im
eager
to
try
a
couple
more
in
this
style
to
see
how
they
measure
up
hope
that
a
few
more
breweries
will
see
their
way
to
brewing
this
style
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
warming
and
extremely
satisfying
the
taste
seems
more
complex
than
some
other
strong
beers
a
dark
amber
pour
with
not
much
white
head
to
speak
of
aromas
of
malt
caramel
raisin
a
little
red
fruit
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
pretty
aggressive
initially
with
caramel
red
fruits
and
some
citruspiney
hops
bold
lively
mouthfeel
for
what
appeared
to
be
a
beverage
with
not
much
carbonation
a
little
boozy
but
that
really
fades
as
it
warms
some
becomes
mostly
sweet
pruney
and
nicely
sticky
but
not
overly
sticky
finishes
with
a
little
sweet
smokiness
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
for
a
big
barleywine
or
wheatwine
the
wheat
is
what
probably
makes
the
difference
for
me
i
thought
this
was
excellent
my
first
experience
with
a
wheatwine
less
edgy
than
the
standard
and
closer
to
the
old
ale
style
at
this
point
there
is
a
small
amount
of
age
which
probably
also
helps
recommend
trying
the
big
beers
from
new
holland
are
all
excellent
in
my
opinion
thus
far
d
probably
the
most
drinkable
wheatwine
i
have
ever
had
the
lack
of
syrup
in
the
body
makes
it
go
down
smooth
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
behind
a
ton
of
sweetness
a
very
nicely
done
beer
d
this
is
interesting
and
unique
and
definitely
worth
trying
however
this
has
absotootly
no
worth
as
a
session
brew
really
interesting
boozy
and
complex
like
a
smoky
islay
single
malt
the
carbonation
is
also
very
lite
and
with
such
a
thick
body
notches
down
the
drinkablity
for
me
the
experience
is
emblemized
by
the
beers
butterscotch
the
whole
thing
is
very
tasty
but
10
makes
it
hardly
bongable
i
kid
d
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
it
was
good
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
another
i
poured
this
from
a
bomber
into
a
duvel
tulip
shaped
glass
my
first
impression
if
very
favorable
the
beer
is
a
ruby
color
with
great
clarity
the
smell
is
fairly
malty
with
a
nice
caramel
scent
the
taste
is
great
i
am
guessing
the
beer
temperature
is
around
55
degrees
i
think
this
is
probably
a
good
temperature
to
be
drinking
this
beer
allowing
a
lot
of
flavors
to
present
themselves
my
first
impression
was
buttery
but
other
flavors
i
taste
are
grapefruit
nutmeg
caramel
and
artichoke
the
alcohol
does
present
itself
a
bit
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
refreshing
because
of
the
strong
citrus
hops
effect
i
recommend
trying
this
one
im
not
sure
about
the
wheat
influence
but
i
guess
i
like
it
in
these
large
quantities
superb
balance
here
on
what
could
easily
be
too
sweet
or
too
thick
or
too
boozy
my
fifth
new
holland
beer
and
by
now
im
thinking
theyre
a
sadly
underrated
brewery
pilgrims
dole
would
provide
excellent
sustenance
for
any
journeyman
wayfarer
or
pilgrim
me
im
loving
sipping
it
in
the
warm
comforts
of
home
above
average
and
one
of
the
top
rated
beers
for
style
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
it
warms
the
insides
with
every
swallow
the
bottle
didnt
mention
abv
but
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
alcohol
flavor
is
the
limiting
factor
on
the
drinkability
for
me
drinks
okay
for
the
alcohol
but
pretty
heavy
still
this
wheatwine
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
barleywine
drinkable
and
goodbut
slightly
overpriced
for
me
and
what
it
is
my
first
wheatwine
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
barleywine
which
i
guess
it
should
it
is
basically
the
same
thing
but
with
wheat
go
figure
i
like
it
and
wish
more
breweries
could
make
more
drinks
really
easy
for
the
style
abv
drinks
more
like
a
super
smooth
barley
wine
to
me
this
one
is
very
well
done
pours
a
deep
copper
amber
color
small
tan
head
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
a
few
blotches
of
oily
bubbles
smells
like
hay
or
grass
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
grassy
up
front
with
spicy
hops
finishing
off
smooth
is
the
wrong
word
more
like
viscus
or
thick
there
sure
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
this
beer
maybe
a
product
of
the
wheat
maybe
the
high
gravity
regardless
i
prefer
more
of
an
american
style
ale
one
fine
wheatwine
by
new
holland
eagerly
forward
and
quite
impressionable
with
its
wholesome
chewy
tasteful
goodness
drinkable
and
dangerously
so
with
its
well
hidden

that
sneaks
in
after

sip

served
on
tap
into
a
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
somehow
leaves
substantial
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
the
taste
is
interesting
and
not
what
i
expected
primary
flavors
are
toffee
and
vanilla
along
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
flavor
i
dont
really
taste
any
hops
but
there
is
a
slight
graininessfrom
the
wheat
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
intense
yet
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
as
well
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
id
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
taste
alcohol
warmth
and
sweet
malts
very
smooth
thanks
to
the
wheat
vague
date
and
cherry
fruit
flavor
d
i
like
beer
i
like
tasty
beer
i
like
strong
tasty
beer
i
like
this
beer
drinkability
is
low
here
because
of
all
that
alcohol
but
on
a
cold
night
it
would
be
ok
to
drink
a
couple
of
bottles
put
you
to
sleep
hv
this
was
my
first
wheatwine
style
and
im
looking
forwarded
to
trying
some
more
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
for
the
night
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
dont
know
if
i
would
be
able
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
by
myself
again
bottle
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
and
is
mostly
clear
and
has
a
nice
short
lived
beige
head
smell
is
a
bit
buttery
oaky
very
strongly
wheaty
and
some
vanilla
too
taste
is
smooth
buttery
wheat
and
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
flavor
as
well
light
to
medium
body
that
goes
down
very
smoothly
with
the
soft
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
nice
beer
overall
i
was
on
the
fence
when
i
saw
this
at
the
store
because
i
havent
liked
the
couple
of
offerings
ive
tried
from
new
holland
but
i
had
never
experienced
a
wheat
wine
before
and
i
am
impressed
kudos
to
new
holland
for
this
one
eric
my
first
wheat
wine
and
a
pleasant
experience
i
have
a
2006
two
brothers
ive
been
aging
and
i
probably
crack
that
in
the
next
few
weeks
d
nice
but
i
think
id
enjoy
as
a
12oz
over
the
22
pours
amberorange
in
the
glass
and
cascades
to
form
a
light
head
that
dissapates
rather
fast
aroma
is
sweet
mainly
malt
with
some
wood
aroma
is
really
nice
reminds
me
of
a
8
year
old
vintage
bigfoot
i
had
flavor
is
different
not
bad
but
interesting
carbonation
is
almost
nonexistant
and
a
silky
mouthfeel
that
coats
slightly
but
pretty
watery
for
the
style
slight
alcohol
in
the
finish
that
is
a
little
dissapointing
upfront
is
sweet
wood
dark
fruits
hops
have
all
but
vanished
from
this
2007
vintage
i
really
think
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
for
the
body
of
this
beer
this
needs
a
few
more
years
and
i
can
see
it
being
a
really
good
barleywine
d
if
you
take
out
the
fact
that
its
alcohol
content
is
high
this
is
definately
one
that
went
down
well
i
could
do
another
on
taste
for
sure
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
however
it
is
the
second
of
the
high
gravity
series
from
new
holland
that
ive
had
the
other
being
dragons
milk
and
in
both
i
have
noticed
a
very
strong
noticeable
alcohol
presence
that
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
actually
like
the
warm
feeling
you
get
from
beers
like
this
but
at
the
same
time
im
not
sure
that
the
alcohol
should
have
been
quite
as
noticeable
in
either
of
these
two
beers
this
is
a
winner
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
to
date
i
need
to
trace
down
some
more
wheatwines
i
think
its
a
must
try
for
fans
of
big
beers
although
like
most
they
catch
up
with
you
towards
the
end
of
the
bomber
offers
something
different
on
just
about
every
sip
reminds
me
of
a
scotch
namely
glenfarclas

massively
complex
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
in
the
future
this
magical
brew
pours
up
a
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
slight
hops
the
taste
is
alcohol
oak
sweet
malts
delicious
ild
love
to
either
try
this
one
again
or
another
of
this
interesting
style
the
beer
is
really
malty
and
fruity
a
strong
alcohol
smell
comes
though
the
beer
is
dark
red
with
a
centimeter
head
but
it
goes
away
fairly
quickly
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
incredibly
malty
with
toffee
and
raisin
flavours
a
nice
caramel
taste
comes
along
with
the
other
flavours
the
flavour
is
quite
strong
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
background
quite
complex
taste
and
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
it
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
barleywine
the
mouthfeel
is
super
thick
its
fairly
drinkable
too

are

strong

tasty
fruity
notes
of
cherries
raisins
dates
and
prunes
the
malts
come
off
just
as
they
smell
in
the
nose
with
sweet
caramel
candy
toffee
and
hints
of
wheat
maybe
this
needs
more
cellaring
to
even
out
the
slightly
high
alcohol
influence
very
enjoyable
now
and
is
one
of
those
beers
im
glad
comes
in
a
bomber
this
one
is
definitely
what
i
would
call
a
malt
bomb
and
a
damn
good
one
at
that
really
impressed
with
new
holland
again
a
unique
brew
almost
like
a
toned
down
barleywine
but
still
retaining
the
taste
and
thickness
of
that
brew
the
wheat
makes
it
more
drinkable
so
if
you
want
a
barleywine
with
a
lighter
body
here
it
is
the
splended
boozy
nose
reveals
a
strong
boozy
wheatwine
the
second
half
of
pilgrims
dole
in
all
quite
delicious
and
while
not
among
my
top
five
wines

it
would
be
an
interesting

to
taste
after

wheatwines
dont
come
by
that
often
notes
one
of
the
most
interesting
strong
beers
i
have
had
to
date
tastes
of
a
mellow
english
barleywine
though
with
a
big
wheat
accent
truly
a
great
beer
and
a
must
try
if
you
are
in
to
strong
ales
of
any
kind
thanks
to
trbeer
for
the
bottle
im
a
fan
of
barleywines
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
giving
this
wheat
wine
a
try
and
i
must
say
that
i
approve
the
wheat
character
adds
a
unique
element
to
the
barleywineold
ale
formula
and
this
is
a
style
that
id
like
to
see
again
thanks
jables
ng
dont
chill
this
one
too
much
i
would
drink
this
just
below
rt
drinkability
is
a
little
bit
limited
due
to
sticky
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
but
very
good
enjoyable
beverage
similar
mild
lemon
hits
the
tongue
not
really
tart
but
mildly
tart
i
guess
definitely
lemon
though
really
wheaty
in
that
regard
which
makes
sense
when
you
see
that
this
is
a
wheatwine
alcohol
and
warm
toast
slathered
in
honey
and
sprinkled
with
nutmeg
sweet
and
forceful
quite
delicious
this
beer
poured
an
orangish
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
faded
quickly
the
lacing
was
there
though
the
nose
of
the
beer
was
simply
amazing
probably
the
best
smelling
beer
i
have
ever
experienced
something
about
it
was
very
comforting
it
reminded
me
of
buttered
toast
with
cinnamon
and
sugar
piled
on
then
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
not
quiet
as
good
initially
very
bready
it
later
became
sweet
then
the
two
flavors
mixed
sweetness
is
akin
to
honey
and
caramel
in
my
opinoin
hops
are
low
but
provide
a
moderate
base
alcohol
is
strong
and
becomes
stronger
later
on
in
the
finish
body
warming
sensation
hits
and
i
am
warmed
up
on
the
cold
michigan
winter
nights
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
is
that
it
is
undercarbonated
but
otherwise
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
i
am
extremely
impressed
with
new
hollands
last
two
new
beers
this
and
the
dragons
milk
notes
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
flavored
beers
ive
had
that
i
can
honestly
say
tastes
outstanding
this
isnt
a
beer
that
you
say
oh
its
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
will
buy
this
till
there
are
none
left
and
since
it
was
such
a
small
release
i
dont
know
if
ill

and
overall
a

and
i
could
easily
drink
again
with
the
fruitiness
coming
through
in
a
very
good
way
cheers
overall
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
style
this
is
definitely
a
good
start
some
very
nice
flavours
in
this
wheat
wine
as
well
as
a
nice
fluffiness
to
the
mouthfeel
ive
had
demeters
harvest
by
half
pints
which
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
but
besides
that
this
is
still
a
good
second
runner
up
worth
the
try
if
youve
never
tried
a
wheatwine
before
this
is
a
decent
place
to
start
very
enjoyable
and
quite
approachable
for
both
the
style
and
the
alcohol
content
ill
for
sure
be
buying
at
least
another
bottle
of
this
if
not
more
it
should
last
quite
a
while
at
that
abv
if
i
dont
get
to
it
too
soon
i
like
it
i
really
like
the
prominent
citrus
fruit
smell
and
taste
the
taste
of
the
bittersweet
fruit
and
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
balance
well
its
not
really
complex
just
good
and
tasty
a
nice
idea
for
a
panpacific
shoutout
to
the
modern
west
coast
american
brewing
ethos
even
though
most
of
the
wheat
wines
in
the
states
seem
to
originate
from
the
midwest
and
points
further
east
anyways
this
offering
displays
the
extreme
malt
characteristics
expected
from
any
beer
delving
into
wine
territory
with
an
edginess
well
attributable
to
the
wheat
hard
to
tell
outright
though
when
the
aforementioned
bitter
fruitiness
in
honour
of
the
pacific
rim
influence
is
so
evident
overall
drinkable
enough
now
and
a
prime
candidate
for
some
short
to
midterm
aging
another
style
im
not
very
familiar
with
but
could
learn
to
love
not
as
heavy
as
a
barley
wine
and
maybe
this
needs
to
age
even
more
so
this
was
the
final
of
3
beers
i
sampled
at
bairds
nakameguro
taproom
the
first
2
beers
i
had
were
the
jubilation
ale
2010
and
the
dark
sky
imperial
stout
a
great
little
beer
plenty
of
flavour
like
in
an
english
barleywine
with
a
hint
of
american
hop
and
a
touch
of
wheat
drinkable
but
i
dont
quite
get
the
discrepancy
between
nose
and
taste
yeah
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sweet
beers
and
this
one
is
just
insipid
i
get
that
its
meant
to
be
sweet
but
it
needs
something
to
balance
it
and
clean
up
the
palate
i
really
couldnt
drink
this
in
quantity
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
is
more
than
enough
pretty
tasty
although
its
a
little
bit
wayward
and
it
doesnt
have
the
exciting
depth
and
complexity
as
many
another
wheatwine
ive
had
sort
of
like
a
more
drinkable
barleywine
still
id
like
to
try
more
from
baird
served
at
room
temperature
which
in
this
room
was
far
too
cold
a
warm
yeasty
malty
aroma
solid
long
lasting
flavor
reminds
me
a
lot
of
old
foghorn
only
softer
very
long
lasting
sweet
caramel
and
creme
brule
flavors
restrained
bitterness
very
smooth
and
minimal
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
this
goes
down
far
too
easy
if
this
was
the
only
beer
on
tap
at
a
bar
and
there
was
no
warning
as
its
alcohol
content
i
guarantee
half
the
patrons
in
the
bar
would
be
blissfully
passed
out
at
the
bar
in
no
time
flat
awesome
overall
good
stuff
a
little
boozier
than
it
needs
to
be
maybe
but
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
quite
nice
a
little
less
booze
or
perhaps
a
little
more
time
in
the
basement
and
this
would
be
excellent
recommended
if
you
happen
to
come
across
it
somewhere

way
too

up
i
could
see
it
as

price
and
lack
of
local
availability
makes
it
unlikely
ill
have
another
one
anytime
soon
and
while
a
novel
drinking
experience
its
not
one
ill
pine
for
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
man
i
am
wheat
wine
fan
and
this
is
probably
the
1
beer
of
the
style
in
my
book
just
super
complex
and
very
tasty
my
only
complaint
that
i
dont
have
another
one
of
these
too
sit
on
this
beer
easily
could
have
aged
for
quite
a
while
longer
orange
body
with
touches
of
amber
and
scarlet
almost
no
head
aside
from
a
smattering
of
patchy
foam
nose
is
like
boozey
orange
with
the
alcohol
shooting
through
the
nostrils
i
can
taste
oranges
covered
with
carmel
and
extremely
pleasant
alcohol
that
i
find
heavenly
theres
a
certain
graininess
to
the
finish
the
light
carbonation
gives
this
a
full
mouth
feeling
that
i
enjoy
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
lot
of
this
were
it
readily
available
and
cheaper
too
my
bottle
cost
me
almost
10
easily
the
best
wheatwine
ive
ever
had
its
hard
to
believe
bill
jenkins
made
this
beer
even
better
than
it
ever
was
but
he
did
cheers
to
you
bill
tastes
lovely

before
the

burn
as
a
side
note
it
looked
so
much
more
better
there
was
a
huge
retentive

on

made

a

overall
this
is
a

that
was

to

this

has
many
good
qualities
but
total
absence
of
a

overly
boozy
taste
detract
somewhat
in
alesmith
we
trust
i
love

was
jazzed
to
see

its
too
simply
sweet
to
reach

still
a

nothing
i

again
this
isnt

most
impressive
offering
for
sure
but
at
least
it
tastes
pretty
decent
this
beer
was
ok
for
what
it
was
it
was
great
but
im
not
really
into
wine
ales
so
it
was
a
little
rich
for
me
definitely
grew
on
me
by
the
end
of
the
taster

got

finish
a
bit
sweeter
than
expected
but
the
drier
finish
balances
that
out
and
make
an
interesting
flavor
progression
im
curious
about
how
this
one
would
age
as
the
sweetness
balances
out
will
cellar
one
if
i
see
another
bottle
serving
type
on
tap
this
beer
is
too
sour
to
enjoy
i
try
something
else
a
pretty
tasty
version
of
the
style
everything
nicely
aligned
with
the
inherent
fruit
esters
more
or
less
running
the
show
im
a
tad
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
barrel
characteristics
but
then
im
not
overall
id
have
no
problem
taking
this
one
to
the
soiree
and
then
dance
with
the
one
i
brung
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a

that
holds
for
quite
a

smells
very
bready
some
peppercorn
spice
bananas
cloves
and
some
fading
tropical
fruit
notes
the
taste
follows
the
nose
rather
well
like
an
imperial
hefeweizen
with
some
earthy
winelike
oak
notes
its
earthy
grass
and
hay
peppery
and
loaded
with
fruit
esters
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
dry
bitter

make
this

would
suggest

kinda
brew
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
i
think
they
could
cut
another
percent
off
of
the
abv
and
really
have
something
to
put
in
their
seasonal
lineup
to
rival

another
winner
from

tastes
like
a

o
love
the
way
this
beer
feels
and
the
french
oak
adds
a
lot
of
character
without
overwhelming
it
much
like
a
heavier
version
of
saison
or
biere
de
garde
seems
very
belgian
in
inspiration
excellent
final
thought
9
is
a
little
high
for
the
quality
but
the
abv
is
very
nice
and
almost
undetectable
in
the
ale
which
is
nice
and
not
nice
very
good
and
unique
wine
wheat
styled
beer
its
very
smooth
going
down
and
the
taste
is
splendid
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
o
surprisingly
very
fruity
but
it
played
well
with
the
wood
this
has
held
up
nicely
over
3
years
this
has
a
white
wine
nose
with
a
background
of
light
bread
without
the
crust
light
malts
a
faint
trace
of
citrusy
hops
and

with
a
1

head
that
quickly

and
produces
rich

on
the
palate
the
yeast
driven
esters
tend
more
towards
white
wine
than
the
barley
wine
fruit
profile
there
is
an
underlying
sweetness
with
a

on
the
finish

lemon
and
some
pine
the
mouth
is
medium
light
and
very
dry
almost
offputting
its
not
like
other
wheatwines
but
it
is
interesting
wellcrafted
but
not
something
i
would
turn
to
often
good
beer
well
crafted
unique
compared
to
others
ive
had
of
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
o
not
bad
but
the
sweetness
begs
for
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
to
balance
it
out
beer
is
delicious
but
does
not
remind
me
of
any
other
wheatwine
ive
ever
had
it
is
more
of
a
farmhouse
style
i
would
rate
it
higher
if
it
was
considered
that
o
enjoyable
brew
but
bills
much
better
as
a
farmhouse
ale
or
saison
than
a
wheat
wine
o
wheatwine
hasnt
always
been
my
favorite
style
but
harvest
dance
is
a
better
example
of
one
very
drinkable
and
well
done

enjoyable
but
an
odd
combo
not
much
from
the
oak
if
anything
just
a
little
lacing
after
five
years
the
carbonation
was
still
strong
and
flavor
interesting
im
definitely
glad
i
had
this
i
am
really
glad
they
made
this
one
again
i
have
regretted
not
picking
up
a
bottle
since
it
was
out
last
this
is
a
real
cool
beer
oddly
light
in
palate
and
oddly
dry
for
the
style
unlike
any
wheatwine
i
have
had
before
it
its
also
quite
hoppy
too
coming
through
almost
as
an
ipa
in
that
way
although
more
fruity
than
bitter
for
sure
the
booze
is
warming
but
not
sharp
and
the
wheat
malt
is
fresh
and
flavorful
but
also
extremely
light
in
weight
honey
sweetness
comes
on
mid
palate
and
the
oak
its
finished
on
is
really
subtle
but
mellows
the
edges
nicely
i
enjoy
the
dynamic
nature
of
this
but
also
the
fact
the
i
can
drink
a
whole
glass
of
it
without
being
full
or
sugared
out
definitely
the
most
unique
expression
of
the
style
ive
had
and
maybe
one
of
my
favorites

those
delicious
hop
notes
are
pretty
muted
due
to
the
malt
bill
there
isnt
enough
specialty
grain
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
without
the
hops
shaking
out
some
carb
helped
round
things
out
but
its
still
a
little
weak
i
need
to
pick
up
a
fresh
bottle
and
revisit
this
one
because
the
potential
is
there
but
it
isnt
meant
to
be
aged
for
this
long
an
excellent
wheat
wine
from
boulevard
as
mentioned
from
other
reviews
it
is
a
huge
foamer
that
takes
forever
to
die
down
attractive
glowing
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
light
foam
layer
with
no
clinging
lacing
on
the
glass
from
this
syrupy
beast
smells
of
honey
pears
light
citrus
fruits
grapes
and
sweet
malt
complex
as
all
get
out
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
and
bittering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
with
the
tastes
of
pears
green
grapes
sweet
almost
belgian
style
candy
sugar
and
medium
bittering
hops
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
lightly
citrus
flavored
meaty
beefy
big
and
bouncy
while
i
would
say
i
was
more
of
a
fan
of
the
bells
versions
which
i
am
holding
for
a
special
occasion
this
is
excellent
and
i
would
purchase
it
again
which
for
me
makes
it
highly
recommendable
for
all
who
can
acquire
it
cheers
o
if
the
bottle
didnt
say
wheat
wine
style
ale
i
would
swear
this
is
a
saison
it
is
the
lightest
easiest
drinking
wheat
wine
i
have
had
i
is
fantastic
on
a
hot
humid
day
it
doesnt
drink
like
a
9
beer
either
the
years
have
been
kind
to
this
one
i
would
hope
for
a
more
refined
sipping
brew
for
a
wheat
wine
but
this
is
certainly
an
experience
from
the
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
special
brews
in
lynnwood
washington
o
i
think
im
starting
to
dislike
wheat
wines
more
than
i
have
in
the
past
it
seems
like
its
a
style
you
really
have
to
nail
to
be
enjoyable
yet
i
havent
had
enough
examples
frequently
enough
to
know
what
needs
to
be
achieved
guess
ill
just
have
to
keep
trying
different
ones
out
overall
this
wheatwine
is
very
delicious
enjoyable
and
tasty
makes
me
want
more
overall
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
next
batch
of
this
stuff
fresh
if
this
is
exemplary
of
the
style
id
love
to
try
more
of
them
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
dont
turn
away
from
it
its
a
solid
beer
even
if
it
is
past
its
bestby
date
once
you
pour
it
make
sure
youre
very
aware
of
where
your
coffee
table
begins
and
ends
too
your
rug
wont
appreciate
it
as
much
as
you
will
the
appearance
of
the
beer
may
have
been
bad
because
of
the
extended
time
in
the
bottle
because
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
floating
bits
throughout
the
beer
but
it
was
not
off
putting
tastewise
in
fact
where
this
beer
lacked
in
smell
and
look
it
more
than
made
up
for
in
taste
faint
tropical
fruits
papaya
pineapple
going
to
a
rich
cream
of
wheat
with
hints
of
yeasty
sweetness
with
the
alcohol
barely
discernible
hops
seem
to
be
only
present
in
the
fruity
notes
probably
have
diminished
with
age
the
mouth
feel
was
actually
pretty
good
and
it
wasnt
as
heavy
and
thick
as
i
expected
felt
much
smaller
than
a
typical
english
barleywine
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
style
that
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
as
this
was
my
first
one
re
i
mustve
been
in
th
right
mood
to
me
its
just
okay
and
didnt
hit
the
spot
and
i
cant
see
many
occasions
where
id
think
differently
rated
down
to
3
5
from
3
75
overall
this
is
good
beer
though
i
suspect
that
the
pineapple
and
melon
notes
might
drive
some
off
luckily
the
bubble
gum
aromas
did
not
translate
to
the
tongue
which
would
have
been
disastrous
the
beer
may
be
a
bit
dry
but
the
massive
fruit
esters
make
it
seem
like
apple
cider
champagne
and
the
result
is
so
interesting
that
its
worth
a
try
i
havent
had
too
many
wheat
wines
to
compare
this
beer
to
but
i
am
enjoying
it
and
think
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
im
glad
i
traded
for
it
o
this
beer
seemed
to
taste
more
like
a
tripel
compared
to
a
wheatwine
and
wasnt
nearly
as
drinkable
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
overall
this
was
my
first
wheatwine
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
drink
this
again
this
is
a
great
beer
but
the
abv
could
be
better
hidden
and
there
could
be
more
subtleties
in
it
as
well
worth
checking
out
o
wonderful
complex
flavor
with
a
noticeable
mouthfeel
harvest
dance
is
a
winner
i
would
buy
it
again
happily

great
wheat
beer
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
i
said
above
im
not
very
familiar
with
the
wheatwine
style
the
only
other
one
ive
had
was
white
chocolate
which
is
amazing
but
i
dont
think
is
representative
of
the
style
to
me
this
one
was
definitely
reminiscent
of
a
tripel
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
which
certainly
isnt
always
the
case
with
high
gravity
beers
i
enjoyed
this
would
recommend
and
plan
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
in
the
style
to
compare
overall
this
is
the
first
wheat
wine
i
have
tasted
however
compared
to
the
description
of
a
fluffy
mouth
feel
i
would
say
this
beer
is
spot
on
in
style
this
style
actually
reminds
me
of
a
farmhouse
alesaison
personally
its
a
little
too
citrusy
for
me
i
dont
know
why
this
is
maybe
it
is
the
wheat
malt
o
much
better
than
i
expected
this
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
at
my
beer
store
for
months
before
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
and
its
actually
very
good
the
wheatwine
style
seems
to
lend
itself
to
the
belgian
flavors
overall
a
wonderful
beer
d
this
was
a
unique
wheat
wine
with
a
very
true
wheat
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
refined
and
the
finish
was
smooth
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
it
would
probably
age
well
but
it
was
also
good
fresh
i
wish
the
barrel
character
was
more
prominent
but
this
was
otherwise
a
very
well
constructed
and
enjoyable
beer
great
beer
the
orangeamber
color
made
this
beer
look
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
wheatwine
the
beer
was
well
carbonated
and
a
four
finger
thick
head
formed
rapidly
in
my
duvel
tulip
glass
the
beer
smelled
strongly
like
oranges
and
roses
the
taste
was
quite
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
because
i
did
not
read
the
back
label
first
the
orange
juice
like
flavor
from
the
wheat
malt
phenols
was
balanced
by
very
citric
hops
there
were
notes
of
clove
and
pepper
in
the
finish
as
well
as
some
white
grape
vinousness
the
body
was
light
and
the
fluffy
feel
given
by
the
carbonation
aided
in
drinkability
the
alcohol
was
very
well
concealed
as
there
was
no
burn

well
made

different
from
the
wheat

ive
had
in

thats

done
o
sort
of
an
odd
choice
to
use
a
belgian
yeast
strain
for
a
wheatwine
but
this
tastes
pretty
good
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
slightly
orange
tinged
golden
color
there
was
a
huge
frothy
head
on
it
that
lingers
awhile
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
nose
is
wheaty
and
bready
maybe
some
spice
and
grassiness
also
the
taste
is
good
wheat
some
spiciness
bready
a
bit
dry
perhaps
some
lighter
fruits
in
the
background
a
bit
of
saisonlike
characteristics
to
it
this
is
a
really
good
beer
this
was
a
really
impressive
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheatwines
but
this
one
has
depth
character
and
a
really
tremendous
flavor
profile
i
thought
for
9
the
abv
was
well
hidden
and
only
added
warmth
and
body
the
fruit
and
hop
flavors
are
tremendous
they
alone
make
this
worth
trying
in
all
this
is
a
really
good
beer
its
impressive
and
worth
your
time
it
pours
orange
with
a
frothy
head
with
large
bubbles
it
smells
fruity
and
bready
but
my
review
does
not
give
its
fragrance
justice
because
it
has
a
quite
pleasing
aroma
it
has
a
pleasant
fruit
taste
maybe
apricots
and
a
nice
yeast
character
being
such
a
weird
style
of
beer
it
has
a
nicely
balanced
body
and
great
carbonation
with
what
i
would
call
amazing
lacing
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
pretty
much
everyone
including
people
who
dont
like
beer
ive
liked
my
wheat
wines
a
little
sweeter
but
fertainly
worth
trying
highly
recommended
offering
from
boulevard
its
one
to
hang
on
to
and
keep
coming
back
to
but
watch
out
itll
mess
you
up
pours
hazy

with
amber
and

heavier
side
of
medium

smooth
and
a
touch

on

edges
persistent
carbonation
certainly
one
of
the
better
wheatwines
ive
enjoyed
overall
4
25
one
of
my
favorite
boulevard
beers
and
one
of
the
better
wheatwines
available
in
my
opinion
the
oak
aging
adds
a
level
of
complexity
without
the
overpowering
nature
that
can
come
with
2nd
use
barrelsits
still
fundamentally
a
wheatwine
calling
to
mind
its
german
ancestor
the
weizenbock
but
with
a
distinctively
american
flair
overall
i
dig
it
first
time
ive
had
it
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
boulevards
smokestack
series
decent
carbonation
good
overall
but
not
one
i
anticipate
fiending
for
ive
been
enjoying
boulevards
offerings
over
the
past
few
months
since
they
started
distribuing
to
georgia
being
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
wines
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
but
it
is
good
and
ill
definately
buy
a
couple
more
i
like
the
smooth
earthyness
that
the
french
oak
and
yeast
give
it
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
havent
had
too
many
wheat
wines
and
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
lots
of
flavors
with
the
vanilla
grape
citrus
oak
and
others
as
with
all
the
other
smokestack
series
offerings
this
one
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
overall
i
would
certainly
recommend
to
try
this
beer
at
least
once
its
not
anything
to
freak
out
about
make
a
special
trip
somewhere
that
carries
it
or
anything
like
that
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
will
get
the
job
done
i
would
absolutely
buy
it
and
drink
it
again
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
not
a
huge
fan
off
all
the
belgian
yeast
notes
also
i
wish
the
hops
were
a
bit
more
prevelant
i
am
also
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
although
i
do
tend
to
enjoy
wheat
wines
decent
brew
pours
carbonated
cloudy
golden
with
a
full
white
head
into
my
snifter
glasses
from
a
750ml
bottle
looked
awesome
as
it
carbonated
fruit
and
wheat
flavor
heavily
in
the
glass
there
is
a
slight
sour
with
a
nice
hit
of
hop
along
with
clove
i
definitely
will
like
to
get
it
again
to
be
added
to
my
cellar
great
wheat
wine
all
the
complexity
you
could
ask
for
in
perfect
balance
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
citrus
fruit
and
wood
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
fairly
tasty
but
strong
o
just
such
a
pretty
looking
beer
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
masked
overall
pretty
good
but
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
which
i
thought
it
was
a
wheatwine
but
its
more
like
belgian
golden
strong
and
saison
combined
but
decent
flavors
complex
and
all
merge
well
although
maybe
a
bit
too
much
booze
and
carbonation
overall
a
real
solid
fantastic
memorable
wheatwine
will
definitely
seek
this
out
in
the
future
very
drinkable
awesome
belgian
style
ale
very
unique
and
smooth
has
a
citrus
flavor
to
it
do
not
pour
into
a
normal
glass
or
you
will
have
a
volcano
of
head
overflowing
onto
your
floor
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
came
across
in
2012
if
i
had
to
compare
this
brew
with
something
ive
had
before
it
would
come
close
to
three
philosophers
belgian
ale
thanks
to
flax
for
this
one
d
it
is
one
for
sipping
for
sure
would
not
be
an
easy
chug
nice
job
boulevard
i
will
have
another
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
lots
of
fruits
and
while
there
is
some
alcohol
in
the
taste
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
a
little
less
heat
and
carbonation
and
this
could
be
even
better
would
certainly
have
it
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
probably
best
drank
fresh
i
dont
think
saving
this
for
a
year
did
it
any
good
while
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
probably
subsided
most
of
the
hop
character
also
did
there
is
still
some
but
for
a
citraforward
wheat
wine
i
would
have
enjoyed
more
but
thats
my
fault
will
try
to
revisit
and

this
brewery
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
annual
beers
o
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
bottle
o
this
one
surprised
me
a
bit
im
not
going
to
lie
most
wheatwines
are
basically
pure
wheat
bombs
this
one
is
balanced
nicely
there
are
a
lot
of
unique
flavors
that
blend
surprisingly
well
the
grape
and
the
oak
and
the
hoppiness
really
come
together
to
make
a
very
unique
brew
i
enjoyed
it
without
the
ridiculous
carbonation
it
could
have
been
a
1
wheatwine
for
me
boogoop
notwithstanding
mouthfeel
is
light
airy
overall
pretty
solid
beer
other
than
the
carbonation
being
too
high
its
quite
attractive
when
it
dies
down
it
has
a
smooth
complex
and
enjoyable
aroma
and
flavor
a
very
nice
warm
evening
sipping
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slightly
chilled
this
is
really
good
maybe
my
favorite
of
the
smokestack
series
so
far
a
really
good
beer
one
of
boulevards
best
efforts
and
i
dont
think
that
this
would
need
any
real
age
on
it
its
just
so
good
right
now
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
tasty
and
deceptively
drinkable
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
again
and
again
m
medium
bodied
poured
from
750ml
to
tulip
after
10
months
in
the
bottle
served
cold
this
thing
pours
a
massive
off
white
loose
head
great
lacing
subtle
beading
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
a
farmhouse
ale
estery
clove
black
pepper
cereal
dead
hops
the
taste
takes
a
similar
direction
very
well
rounded
and
easy
to
approach
the
freshness
of
the
wheat
has
succumb
to
a
yeasty
tartness
quite
good
and
very
different
than
its
former
self
dense
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
but
very
little
notice
of
the
alcohol
for
the
high
abv
making
it
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
brew
that
i
enjoyed
alcohol
doesnt
taste
heavy
but
dont
let
that
fool
you
definitely
a
great
wheat
wine
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
sadly
this
falls
into
the
former
o
as
a
novice
of
wheatwines
i
cant
make
any
comparison
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
especially
if
you
age
it
a
while
delicious
on
tap
at
the
muddy
pig
poured
into
a

glass
pours
a
hazy
deep

color

very
tall
puffy
white
head
a
strong
fresh
hop
leaf
nose
woody
strong
notes
of
lemon
and
almost
mangoish
fruity
nose
a
light
cinnamon
or
allspice
type
spiciness
mild
woody
presence
and
a
full
sourness
of
the
wheat
malt
at
the
tail
end
of
the
beer
as
a
whole
this
beer
has
an
extremely
lively
paring
of
flavors
it
starts
off
with
a
fantastic
fresh
bitter
hop
leafy
kick
and
transitions
to
a
spicy
woody
citrus
and
light
mango
fruitiness
middle
and
finishes
with
a
light
bitterness
with
a
solid
wheat
malt
presence
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
wheatwine
the
beer
pours
a
orangeambergold
color
if
that
makes
sense
extreme
clarity
with
continuous
bubbles
it
forms
a
hyuge
white
bubbly
and
frothy
head
that
is
very
sticky
the
nose
really
comes
into
its
own
as
the
beer
is
a
bit
warmer
belgian
style
yeast
with
clove
and
banana
as
well
as
citrus
rinds
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
definitely
puts
forward
some
citrus
hops
with
bready
notes
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
it
has
a
medium
sticky
body
that
coats
the
mouth
as
well
as
noticeable
carbonation
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
really
an
outstanding
one
the
banana
and
spice
were
all
a
little
overdone
and
overshadowed
some
of
the
wheat
malts
and
hoppiness
for
me
mildly
cloudy
golden
hue
with
an
enormous
bubbly
frothy
offwhite
head
belgian
yeasts
whole
grains
citrus
bananas
clove
and
some
spice
in
the
aroma
smells
almost
like
a
good
hefeweizen
leveled
and
flavorful
heavy
citrus
booze
wheat
banana
and
clove
on
the
initial
sip
definitely
a
big
hit
on
the
citrus
while
pale
sugared
fruits
follow
some
sweet
bitter
undertones
float
along
with
the
rest
of
the
medium
to
full
sized
body
aggressive
carbonation
gives
this
brew
a
big
kick
quality
wheatwine
styled
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
boozy
somw
grain
on
the
nose
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
seemed
a
little
spicy
actually
which
i
was
surprised
about
the
flavors
of
sweet
grains
and
wheat
are
blended
with
a
semi
spicy
finish
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
smooth
but
it
gave
off
a
good
amount
of
boozy
heat
carbonation
was
minimal
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
ive
had
better
its
a
rough
and
tough
beer
that
seems
to
be
trying
to
be
a
lot
of
things
the
belgian
yeast
is
out
of
the
deep
outfield
for
me
i
hadnt
expected
that
its
over
carbonation
affects
the
appearance
significantly
im
a
bit
disappointed
to
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
boulevard
beers
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
and
high
carbonation
leads
to
a
good
feel
soft
feeling
and
pillowy
in
the
mouth
overall
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
lately
very
yeasty
and
fruit
forward
nice
one
from
boulevard
thanks
salukialum
for
the
opportunity
o
im
from
kc
and
honestly
ive
never
been
the
biggest
fan
of
the
beers
they
have
on
tap
in
the
bars
but
this
beer
i
believe
is
worlds
above
those
it
has
a
full
and
balanced
flavor
aromatic
and
smooth
o
this
was
not
like
any
wheatwine
ive
ever
tried
high
quality
stuff
for
sure
and
much
more
in
step
with
the
wheat
part
of
the
wine
than
any
others
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
tried
o
interesting
flavors
and
pretty
drinkable
for
the
styleabv
shows
some
nice
complexity
as
it
warms
i
havent
really
enjoyed
the
other
wheatwines
ive
tried
but
this
is
pretty
good
reminds
me
vaguely
of
a
sauternes
overall
an
above
average
to
ok
wheatwine
i
have
been
blown
away
by
some
wheatwines
i
have
tasted
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
would
be
really
curious
though
to
try
this
with
some
age
i
will
say
the
whole
time
i
was
drinking
this
i
was
thinkingi
have
had
better
in
the
styleyet
i
want
more
i
want
more
o
wow
simply
amazing
beverage
that
is
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
all
time
favorites
i
truly
look
forward
to
engulfing
this
lush
brew
again
and
again
o
im
sincerely
impressed
with
this
beer
the
play
between
funk
and
sweetness
is
spot
on
i
love
the
earthy
notes
in
this
beer
and
i
love
the
crisp
citrus
this
beer
is
pretty
darn
good
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
if
im
gonna
spend
the
10
i
might
take
a
gamble
on
something
else
in
that
price
range
instead
of
buying
this
one
again
though
pours
a
hazy
orangish
yellow
color
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
that
retreats
to
form
a
thin
white
layer
on
the
top
smells
sweet
with
lots
of
wheat
some
lemon
and
some
bubblegum
the
taste
follows
the
nose
really
well
starts
off
with
some
honey
flavors
that
are
mixed
in
with
some
wheat
malts
mixed
in
is
a
lot
of
bubblegum
with
some
more
of
the
honey
and
a
touch
of
molasses
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
however
this
is
a
delicious
beer
it
is
an
amped
up
wheat
beer
that
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
outstanding
wheatwine
light
bodied
and
kind
of
an
imperial
saison
quite
interesting
overall
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
and
it
is
fairly
enjoyable
it
reminds
me
of
a
saison
with
a
toned
down
peppery
taste
i
like
the
unique
qualities
of
this
beer
it
looks
amazing
smells
amazing
but
the
flavor
and
feel
fall
just
a
touch
short
this
wheatwine
does
have
a
best
by
date
of
1010
and
i
am
a
couple
months
past
that
but
for
a
strengthy
beer
that
shouldnt
make
much
of
a
difference
except
for
perhaps
a
little
lack
of
aroma
hops
very
good
beer
either
way
o
well
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
this
i
was
surprised
by
the
belgian
influence
this
beer
seems
to
have
it
appears
that
it
is
intentional
taste
is
spicy
hops
meld
with
the
wheat
backbone
but
get
clouded
by
the
massive
carbonation
plenty
of
booze
character
mediumbodied
but
the
excessive
carbonation
really
kills
any
potential
it
might
have
enjoyed
at
the
ale
house
in
amesbury
ma
this
brew
shows
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
healthy
offwhite
colored
head
and
gutsy
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
mixes
refined
fruity
banana
clove
with
a
bubblegum
hop
that
really
entices
the
worthy
observer
one
of
the
undeniable
scents
in
beer
ken
the
flavor
brings
on
big
bubblegum
hop
and
biscuit
clove
over
cloying
lemon
wheat
sweetness
this
stuff
is
near
full
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
luscious
feel
a
little
thick
to
be
sessionable
but
a
no
brainer
flavor
fest
for
the
belgianesque
full
flavored
brew
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
love
the
play
of
flavors
with
the
spicyyeasty
aspects
mixed
with
the
heavy
citrus
flavors
at
first
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
ithaca
thirteen
which
i
think
is
a
highlight
of
2011
the
booziness
here
makes
this
less
enjoyable
but
doesnt
kill
this
entirely
i
know
im
knocking
the
booziness
a
bit
hard
here
but
i
really
find
this
to
be
a
great
beer
i
guess
i
find
the
booziness
to
be
an
obvious
flaw
where
other
issues
maybe
arent
as
apparent
very
good
beer
o
a
nice
and
refreshing
higher
alcohol
brew
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
in
this
beer
somehow
the
lemony
and
bready
flavors
would
lend
this
beer
very
nicely
to
being
served
with
a
nice
dinner
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
its
hugely
unique
and
a
real
pleasure
to
consume
i
love
the
nose
and
the
taste
has
some
fantastic
subtlety
to
it
im
really
looking
forward
to
the
progression
this
beer
will
give
me
as
it
warms
thanks
for
another
great
one
overall
another
very
good
beer
from
boulevard
not
their
best
but
still
an
excellent
beer
some
time
will
no
doubt
settle
this
a
bit
which
is
exactly
why
im
planning
on
setting
aside
one
or
two
great
now
though
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
very
interesting
broke
this
out
at
elrogishs
barleywine
themed
cabin
weekend
altogether
a
great
wheat
wine
and
would
recommend
this
to
any
friend
o
i
can
see
why
people
would
like
this
beer
it
really
is
the
smell
while
drinking
that
makes
this
beer
too
sweet
for
me
alcohol
and
hops
are
present
just
well
hidden
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
white
wine
either
so
maybe
thats
why
i
dont
quite
get
it
overy
different
from
any
wheatwine
ive
ever
had
but
really
nice
the
harvest
dance
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
am
sharing
with
my
neighbor
who
is
also
a
boulevard
fan
the
beer
pours
a
fully
primed
hazy
copper
with
huge
head
that
is
only
slightly
lacing
the
smell
includes
subtle
spice
and
hop
along
with
a
slight
white
wine
aroma
the
taste
has
hop
and
spice
with
a
white
wine
overtone
the
mouthfeel
is
good
the
beer
was
super
primed
like
popping
a
bottle
of
champaign
overall
it
was
a
pleasure
to
try
this
beer
and
certainly
would
suggest
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
different
boulevard
has
started
distributing
to
ma
this
one
is
a
bit
odd
to
me
its
pleasant
enough
however
it
drinks
more
like
tripel
than
a
wheatwine
notes
2011
batch
2
pretty
complex
and
delicious
beer
lots
of
fruitiness
and
oakiness
with
a
good
hop
showing
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
just
well
made
and
plenty
of
complex
and
subtle
flavors
well
worth
a
try
o
another
great
offering
from
the
smokestack
series
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
and
i
like
the
addition
of
citra
hops
worth
seeking
out
o
wow
what
a
tasty
beer
big
and
bold
full
of
flavor
i
have
been
having
this
the
last
couple
of
days
but
just
getting
to
review
it
now
must
buy
another
couple
of
bottles
before
they
are
gone
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
slick
feeling
if
you
get
the
chance
try
this
overall
not
a
bad
wheatwine
style
brew
and
i
am
impressed
with
the
presence
of
citruslike
hops
here
once
again
im
wondering
why
i
waited
a
year
before
trying
this
the
smokestack
series
has
been
as
reliable
as
clockwork
in
the
high
quality
of
their
beers
this
is
my
first
wheat
wine
and
i
could
imagine
its
set
the
bar
high
for
the
style
nice
work
boulevard
o
quite
good
id
prefer
a
12oz
and
id
have
this
more
often
overall
unique
tasty
smooth
enjoyable
beer
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
offering
and
i
really
didnt
find
it
too
different
than
some
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
hefeweizens
out
there
ie
new
glarus
dancing
man
wheat
i
really
enjoyed
harvest
dance
if
it
werent
for
the
obnoxious
head
that
formed
after
every
pour
i
this
would
be
an
easy
a
rated
beer
for
me
if
and
when
i
ever
buy
this
again
i
hope
i
have
better
results
appearancewise
o
delicious
beer
perfect
seasonal
just
amazing
wheat
and
hops
this
is
really
nice
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
again
but
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
the
nose
is
phenomenal
and
quite
alive
this
beer
is
almost
worth
buying
just
to
smell
it
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
definitely
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
give
this
one
a
try
i
highly
recommend
it
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
smooth
you
can
feel
the
wheat
gently
rolling
down
your
throat
as
if
you
inhaled

slow
dissipation
to
just
beer
fresh
wheat
in
the
nose
with
spice
and
lots
of
soft
fruitorange
peel
mango
pear
clear
clean
spice
from
the
yeast
that
continues
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
a
nice
twang
from
the
wheat
and
spice
but
the
fruit
lessens
compared
to
the
nose
very
nice
beer
9
is
completely
unapparent
pours
a
golden
reddish
orange
with
a
bunch
of
white
frothy
head
looks
great
smells
wheaty
and
boozy
a
really
nice
aroma
tastes
sweet
and
malty
lots
of
wheat
on
the
tongue
boozy
but
light
and
tasty
very
well
carbonated
overall
pretty
enjoyable
especially
on
a
cold
day
this
is
the
only
wheatwine
and
the
second
harvest
dance
ive
ever
had
but
i
have
to
say
i
love
it
this
is
a
beer
i
would
keep
stocked
at
all
time
especially
if
boulevard
put
it
in
4packs
of
12oz
bottles
for
say
11
just
saying
very
good
beer
very
complex
theres
a
rawness
but
its
weaved
together
in
a
delicate
way
its
fruity
raw
mellow
sweet
dry
bitter
and
much
more
o
i
have
had
many
a
hefs
but
this
is
my
first
wheat
wine
beer
and
i
am
just
not
picking
up
any
of
the
wood
notes
with
it
overall
though
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
but
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
again
amazing
complex
and
showing
beautifully
for
its
age
gets
oakier
and
spicer
towards
the
yeasty
bottom
of
the
bottle
which
is
almost
a
whole
different
experience
completely
im
definitely
picking
up
the
last
few
of
these
in
nashville
for
the
cellar
in
conclusion
a
highly
enjoyable
ale
with
not
much
else
like
it
i
really
hope
they
create
this
again
also
how
cool
is
that
label
art
would
seek
out
again
overall
a
sipper
o
the
nice
fruity
esters
and
bright
juicy
hops
are
really
supported
by
the
dry
crisp
finish
the
fizz
and
citra
finish
is
a
great
combination
and
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
without
a
label
i
would
have
called
this
an
ipa
or
imp
ipa
not
a
wheatwine
but
no
matter
what
you
label
it
it
was
tasty
overall
i
like
this
one
def
a
different
style
with
the
wheat
combined
very
enjoyable
medium
bodied
and
slightly
oxidized
with
tight
carbonation
up
front
and
a
prominent
dry
earthy
hop
presence
pretty
bitter
with
lots
of
earthy
pine
and
only
faint
citrus
sweetness
lots
of
heat
and
boozy
sweetness
with
sweet
malt
notes
underneath
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
not
as
earthy
leathery
as
expected
with
a
but
more
wheat
character
than
the
aroma
suggests
faint
spice
with
some
bready
yeast
and
orange
peel
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
give
this
beer
a
bit
of
complexity
but
overall
its
too
boozy
and
a
bit
of
a
mess
cheers
o
i
am
quite
pleased
with
harvest
dance
boulevard
once
again
does
not
disappoint
i
know
their
beers
especially
in
the
smokestack
series
tend
to
possess
a
belgian
bent
so
i
will
keep
that
in
mind
when
i
sample
my
next
wheat
wine
whatever
it
might
be
this
is
i
believe
a
great
benchmark
to
have
moving
forward
and
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
especially
if
you
like
their
tank
7
since
they
share
many
qualities
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
a
boulevard
smokestack
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
its
not
the
best
wheat
wine
ive
had
but
i
like
the
hopforward
character
an
excellent
example
of
a
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
almost
changes
my
mind
another
success
from
the
smokestack
series
overall
its
like
a
hefe
on
roids
citrus
flavors
were
nice
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
overpowering
like
i
thought
it
might
be
solid
beer
harvest
dance
was
orange
in
color
and
hazy
it
had
a
large
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
citrus
hops
the
taste
was
citrus
grapefruit
with
some
pepper
and
a
little
sweet
malt
the
finish
was
dry
with
some
some
residual
citrus
peppery
spice
and
a
bit
of
throat
warming
alcohol
it
was
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
medium
to
medium
big
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
it
has
a
good
mouth
feel
drinkability
isnt
the
greatest
because
of
the
alcohol
but
the
one
bottle
will
be
enjoyed
for
some
time
i
like
it
and
the
price
was
right
and
as
always
the
label
of
boulevards
smokestack
series
is
tres
cool
pours
a
very
pretty
brownorangegolden
combination
with
a
huge
billowing
off
white
head
and
a
very
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
very
complex
for
one
second
it
smells
like
a
very
interesting
deep
red
wine
and
then
for
the
next
instant
the
wheat
malts
flow
through
and
the
next
a
very
zesty
citrus
tastes
very
complex
as
well
grape
skins
orange
lemon
zest
wheat
malts
interesting
citra
and
noble
hops
contribute
an
almost
muted
bitterness
that
is
very
well
balanced
there
are
a
few
spices
in
there
pepper
and
something
else
the
yeast
is
very
apparent
as
well
the
alcohol
does
not
come
through
which
i
think
is
a
good
thing
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
very
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
drank
the
whole
750ml
and
wanted
more
what
a
great
beer
one
of
the
most
surprising
experiences
i
have
had
with
any
kind
of
craft
beer
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
horrible
beer
and
i
cant
believe
i
was
totally
blown
away
is
is
the
first
commercial
wheatwine
ive
had
and
its
quite
good
however
i
wish
it
would
share
a
bit
more
in
common
with
its
barley
cousin
and
a
bit
less
with
a
saison
still
i
cant
complain
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
almost
hate
to
say
this
as
there
are
so
many
beers
that
are
in
the
wine
style
that
are
stupidly
bold
but
this
beer
is
really
reserved
overall
the
hops
are
there
in
the
flavor
but
dont
do
much
for
the
finish
that
is
ok
with
me
but
it
seems
a
little
lame
for
the
style
i
dont
know
this
beer
is
clean
and
well
balanced
which
i
like
a
lot
it
is
just
very
reserved
for
what
it
claims
to
be
so
i
would
recommend
trying
it
but
dont
expect
an
assault
to
your
palate
atmosphere
is
very
good
decent
appearance
great
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
not
too
complex
but
a
little
grain
with
some
nice
sweetness
flavor
is
bittersweet
combination
of
grain
citrus
and
honey
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
really
wish
i
had
tried
this
fresh
so
i
could
compare
this
one
especially
since
boulevard
has
pulled
out
of
this
area
oh
well
being
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
in
general
this
one
did
not
disappoint
drink
its
a
new
taste
but
its
very
good
the
9
1
is
well
hidden
within
this
big
beer
the
profile
is
very
nice
ill
have
to
find
some
more
wheatwines
to
try
it
was
dry
and
spicywrong
adjective
in
my
head
but
all
i
can
think
maybe
musky
i
guess
overall
i
hate
wheatwines
not
anymore
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
will
be
looking
for
more
d
ive
never
tried
this
style
before
but
i
found
this
really
interestingits
kind
of
like
an
imperial
witte
a
fantastic
beer
the
aroma
and
taste
constantly
changed
as
i
drank
it
good
job
boulevard
pours
a
hazy
goldenyellow
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
preceded
by
a
bit
of
sweetness
citrus
and
some
mild
spice
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
light
pale
malt
and
white
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
some
mild
fruit
body
is
medium
with
a
dry
finish
wow
a
wheatwine
thats
actually
pleasurable
rather
than
just
being
somewhat
i
can
palate
what
a
novel
concept
thanks
boulevard
overall
impression
orgasm
in
a
glass
what
can
i
say
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
heavy
on
the
lead
off
and
the
finish
is
oddly
dry
and
bitter
the
mid
palate
is
yeast
wheat
goodness
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
not
as
sweet
as
other
wheatwines
and
not
as
harsh
as
some
if
it
werent
for
the
dry
bitter
finish
i
would
really
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
nice
notes
this
is
probably
my
second
wheatwine
ive
had
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
most
the
complex
and
interesting
flavors
really
keep
you
engaged
with
the
beer
this
beer
was
supposedly
past
its
best
by
date
but
i
was
truly
impressed
with
this
one
with
a
year
on
it
i
will
be
picking
up
one
now
to
try
fresh
and
another
to
age
allegedly
this
was
primed
with
grape
juice
which
explains
some
of
the
nice
fruit
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
was
amazed
at
the
drinkability
and
light
nature
of
this
never
quite
had
a
wheatwine
that
fit
the
bill
like
this
but
it
was
quite
nice
very
good
beer
the
hops
are
a
nice
interpretation
keep
cranking
these
brews
out
please
d
very
drinkable
and
very
delicious
my
only
complaint
is
the
heat
on
this
one
pronounced
no
surprise
since
its
boulevard
smokestack
its
just
plain
fabulous
somewhat
hoppy
but
this
wheat
wine
is
a
hint
different
from
the
barleywine
style
while
sweetness
the
carbination
is
light
and
being
only
9
this
is
one
really
drinkable
wheatwine
750ml
alone
have
to
confess
that
wheatwines
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
nonetheless
nicely
done
very
drinkable
i
easily
drank
most
of
the
750
before
starting
the
review
i
think
the
high
amount
og
wheat
makes
it
deceptively
light
and
drinkable
d
starts
out
fantastic
but
the
flat
boring
finish
really
seems
odd
and
is
disappointing
not
all
that
intriguing
overall
a
cellar
beer
if
ive
ever
had
one
i
wish
i
had
another
d
the
most
drinkable
example
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
by
far
i
really
enjoy
the
style
but
it
is
hard
to
get
beers
really
a
tasty
beer
they
need
to
make
this
again
and
again
fruity
and
spicey
nightcap
good
for
sipping
d
this
is
really
nice
stuff
this
beer
reminds
me
why
wheatwines
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
this
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
thanks
dan
even
though
the
final
score
wont
necessarily
reflect
it
harvest
dance
is
one
of
the
best
wheatwines
that
ive
had
so
far
the
taste
score
just
missed
the
next
highest
number
it
might
be
the
alcohol
talking
but
what
the
hell
4
5
it
is
im
not
sure
if
boulevard
has
plans
to
release
this
smokestack
series
beer
yearly
but
it
would
be
great
if
they
did
pours
a
wonderful
cloudy
copper
with
excellent
head
and
some
decent
lacing
very
deep
malty
scent
nice
and
wheaty
with
huge
spice
pepper
mostly
tones
very
nice
taste
a
wonderful
deep
and
thick
wheat
maltiness
with
huge
almost
too
much
spice
flavors
pepper
again
mostly
goes
down
really
smooth
with
almost
no
hint
of
the
high
abv
dvery
enjoyable
well
balanced
and
integrated
with
all
flavors
being
subtle
and
well
presented
hints
of
booze
in
the
back
but
still
well
done
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
and
for
my
first
time
trying
this
brewery
and
style
i
am
quite
impressed
with
both
dominant
sweet
notes
of
unfiltered
honey
and
raw
cane
sugar
peppery
and
a
little
sharp
with
alcohol
a
bit
prominent
in
the
flavor
some
maltyness
rears
toward
the
end
wiht
hints
of
grape
nuts
ive
yet
to
come
across
a
wheatwine
that
did
not
struggle
to
contain
itself
and
this
is
a
worthy
effort
a
great
wheatwine
one
i
would
not
mind
partaking
in
again
i
did
hate
to
see
the
bottle
go
drinkability
a
joy
to
pour
down
the
ole
gullet
go
on
friends
and
embrace
a
heavyhanded
dose
of
wheat
i
sure
as
hell
did
great
beer
love
the
tropical
hops
laced
with
the
strength
of
the
beer
and
livley
character
ive
never
had
this
before
but
i
would
say
this
might
be
peaking
now
md
thick
bodied
beer
that
is
smooth
and
coating
nearly
syrupy
at
the
finish
easy
to
drink
despite
a
higher
abv
the
smokestack
series
continues
to
impress
conclusion
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
i
tasted
it
fresh
at
the
brewery
on
tap
and
wasnt
really
sure
then
the
bottle
said
this
was
best
before
october
2010
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
now
wsome
age
on
it
eh
its
better
but
its
still
a
bit
of
an
oddball
apricot
with
blonde
highlights
and
a
massive
stiff
rocky
eggshell
cap
that
lasts
a
good
while
and
leaves
sheets
of
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
peaches
and
apricots
wheat
malt
tang
and
lemon
zest
make
up
the
fabulous
smelling
aroma
on
this
one
the
flavor
is
fruity
up
front
with
apricot
and
pear
notes
and
dry
yeasty
and
mildly
alcoholic
in
the
finish
full
bodied
and
slightly
sticky
with
ample
carbonation
there
are
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
melding
together
to
form
a
really
great
beer
i
think
im
going
to
hoard
all
the
bottles
of
this
that
i
can
it
is
drinking
very
well
right
now
this
beer
is
really
under
the
radar
for
how
great
it
is
poured
a
amber
brown
with
orangish
highlights
and
had
a
big
2
finger
head
it
also
left
lots
of
bubbly
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
big
on
grains
such
a
wheat
yeast
and
bready
notes
that
was
also
a
little
spicy
that
was
made
up
of
cloves
coriander
and
pepper
there
was
also
faint
caramel
and
honey
scents
the
flavor
was
also
a
bit
hearty
with
the
bready
yeasy
malt
make
up
that
had
coriander
caramel
and
clove
accents
in
the
background
i
got
slight
hops
and
honey
that
seemed
to
be
aa
little
tart
as
well
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
tons
of
carbonation
that
had
a
grainy
slight
spice
and
tart
finish
it
was
a
taste
and
intresting
smelling
brew
that
astually
drank
damn
good
ive
had
this
one
twice
now
and
both
times
were
quite
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
nice
wheat
wine
ive
only
had
three
at
this
point
and
this
has
been
the
best
of
the
bunch
its
another
excellent
offering
from
boulevards
smokestack
series
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
formed
a
1
12
beige
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
brew
meringuey
head
isnt
going
anywhere
fast
snowconing
above
the
rim
with
tons
of
hunky
lasting
lace
aroma
is
wheat
effervescence
and
light
tartness
taste
starts
with
light
banana
sweetness
goes
tart
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
sharp
clove
character
alcohol
heat
and
flavor
is
subtle
mouthfeel
is
prickly
bubbles
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
this
one
could
smooth
out
a
bit
but
an
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
mostly
clear
somewhat
hazed
orange
amber
topped
by
lots
o
thick
creamcolored
froth
which
leaves
some
thick
lacing
behind
as
it
dies
away
the
nose
is
packed
with
sweet
wheat
hows
that
for
a
season
finale
twist
along
with
lesser
amounts
of
sweetgrass
butter
and
sugary
caramel
this
caramel
returns
with
quite
a
vengeance
in
the
taste
along
with
all
that
wheat
some
floral
hoppiness
toffee
and
a
mixed
bag
of
miscellaneous
spice
rack
staples
the
overall
taste
is
a
combination
of
light
and
buttery
sweetness
and
a
relatively
weak
piney
bitterness
its
all
good
the
body
is
a
firm
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
partially
dry
finish
a
very
solid
and
tasty
wheatwine
if
i
do
say
so
myself
and
i
do
d
overall
not
bad
but
not
what
i
hoped
for
or
expected
best
by
1010
poured
into
a
snifter
a
clear
orange
infused
glden
with
a
huge
blooming

it
settles
into
a
frothy
mass
aromas
are
a
mix
of
citruscaramelvanillaand
faint
leather
big
chewey
feel
and
not
overcarbonated
like
i
was
thinking
it
might
be
in
the
mouth
big
caramel
and
honey
sweet
notes
upfront
with
some
of
the
leathery
component
coming
thru
as
wellthe
finish
is
sharp
and
leafy
with
a
big
citric
jolt
as
well
complex
to
the
hiltwith
a
good
combination
of
sweetish
deep
maltiness
and
herbalcitric
hop
the
alcohol
does
play
a
part
as
the
beer
warmsbut
the
hops
really
play
a
big
role
in
this
wheatwine
drinkability
alcohol
apparent
but
goood
sweet
grains
and
tangy
zesty
wheat
interplay
perfectly
with
a
spicy
hayesque
and
floral
hop
flavor
not
an
abundance
of
bitterness
and
the
lingering
sweetness
is
really
the
only
minor
flaw
i
can
find
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
a
touch
hot
and
lends
a
light
tropical
aspect
this
is
easily
the
best
wheatwine
i
have
had
and
another
surefire
winner
in
boulevards
smokestack
series
i
will
be
anxious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
as
it
is
drinking
mighty
fine
right
now
drinkability
this
is
the
only
drawback
in
my
opinion
this
one
drinks
too
smoothly
and
too
well
its
9
1
abv
is
remarkably
well
hidden
and
the
light
effervescent
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
a
lion
in
sheeps
clothing
polishing
off
an
entire
750ml
on
a
work
night
would
not
be
out
of
the
question
but
the
consequences
the
next
day
would
make
you
seriously
ponder
how
you
managed
to
go
back
for
glass
after
glass
of
such
a
heady
beer
like
all
the
smokestack
series
so
far
recommend
this
one
again
as
with
seemingly
all
of
the
smokestack
beers
i
had
trouble
removing
the
cork
when
i
finally
got
it
open
i
was
rewarded
with
a
beautiful
golden
color
and
a
good
two
inches
of
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
dark
spices
and
maybe
golden
delicious
apples
on
the
palate
i
found
a
nicely
balanced
strong
wheat
beer
with
alcohol
sweet
malt
and
some
nice
spiciness
another
good
effort
from
boulevard
courtesy
of
oddefellowe
pours
deep
gold
with
tall
nearly
explosive
off
white
head
it
smells
a
touch
infected
with
bright
notes
of
wheat
sharp
yet
not
strong
acidity
a
mild
level
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
the
taste
is
bright
and
punchy
with
thin
wheat
mixing
with
a
bit
of
acidity
and
then
moving
into
smooth
somewhat
sweet
banana
if
it
is
infected
it
wasnt
much
of
a
distraction
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
tremendously
its
one
of
the
better
in
the
smokestack
series
a
series
which
has
produced
some
damned
good
beers
i
also
have
to
say
its
one
of
the
better
wheatwines
ive
had
very
drinkable
for
9
abv
drinkability
a
surprisingly
enjoyable
brew
the
taste
had
a
few
detractors
and
i
cant
help
but
think
that
what
was
an
accident
the
sheer
volume
of
carbonation
actually
turned
out
to
be
a
bit
of
a
blessing
cutting
through
the
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
providing
a
basis
for
a
gorgeous
appearance
the
abv
is
actually
remarkably
low
for
a
wheatwine
9
1
really
but
its
definitely
there
after
a
while
regardless
this
is
a
solid
brew
one
that
showcases
the
better
sides
of
a
wheatwine
with
a
few
missteps
worth
a
try
as
most
boulevard
brews
are
cheers
harvest
dances
excellence
makes
me
interested
in
pursuing
the
wheatwine
style
because
if
this
beer
is
any
indication
wheatwines
are
unique
beers
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
harvest
dance
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
it
pours
a
dark
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
head
that
sticks
around
the
taste
is
also
very
wheaty
also
a
little
bitter
the
9
1
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
a
good
beer
for
those
who
like
wheat
beers
so
good
can
i
find
any
way
to
improve
this
who
am
i
to
suggest
theres
anything
better
9
1
but
much
more
easiergoing
than
other
strong
wheat
wines
ive
had
lately
starts
tropical
fruit
gets
dry
and
now
the
alcohol
gets
a
bit
of
a
burn
but
still
really
cool
down
the
tongue
and
yeah
theres
some
oakyness
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
quite
a
long
time
highly
recommended
too
big
of
bottle
for
one
person
it
gets
old
about
half
way
down
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
herbal
spice
notes
its
a
pretty
solid
and
nice
wheatwine
i
guess
i
prefer
a
broader
and
thicker
sense
in
them
not
the
top
of
the
crop
from
boulevard
but
a
rather
reliable
brew
of
the
maltier
wheatwines
a
sipper
for
sure
id
love
to
see
what
this
beer
tastes
like
in
a
year
or
more
lovely
now
d
heavy
but
satisfying
one
of
the
stronger
entries
ive
had
of
the
nonlimited
boulevard
smokestacks
taste
is
citrus
rind
and
hops
and
spice
it
reminds
me
of
a
tripel
and
a
pale
ale
mixed
into
one
beer
this
is
very
appealing
i
served
this
at
just
the
right
temperature
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
carbonated
as
well
as
i
finish
this
beer
i
am
so
glad
my
son
passed
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
some
time
the
first
wheat
wine
i
have
tried
a
nice
amber
copper
color
with
big
sticky
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
largely
clove
with
some
spicy
fruity
notes
some
musty
and
almost
smokey
notes
taste
is
really
interesting
some
big
leafy
and
citrus
hops
but
also
some
clove
spice
some
tobacco
some
sweetness
in
there
too
im
really
impressed
i
like
this
better
than
the
other
wheatwine
ive
had
i
e
nemesis
mf
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
it
definitely
keeps
it
going
coating
lingering
aftertaste
good
drinkability
though
the
abv
and
robust
flavor
limits
a
bit
pours
a
gorgeous
hazed
copper
with
a
fluffy
and
very
lively
three
finger
pearl
head
with
intense
lace
a
very
beautiful
beer
smells
toasty
and
sweet
coriander
bread
and
sweet
yeast
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
grassyearthiness
flavor
and
high
carbonation
stings
then
very
nice
toasty
oak
tones
set
in
with
a
malty
sweet
balance
banana
nice
dark
and
tropical
fruit
aromas
of
funkiness
and
barnyardhay
as
it
warms
a
bit
clingy
on
the
teeth
a
bitter
finish
that
lingers
for
minutes
after
consumption
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
a
massive
three
inches
in
height
and
recedes
extremely
slowly
into
thick
chunky
lacing
that
sticks
around
until
the
beer
is
gone
this
beer
looks
a
lot
like
a
really
good
hefe
and
i
like
that
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
banana
pale
malt
some
earthiness
and
alcohol
up
front
the
taste
is
maltier
than
the
aroma
with
the
earthy
yeast
tones
kicking
through
in
the
finish
there
is
a
nice
overripe
fruit
thing
going
on
that
i
find
pleasing
the
alcohol
that
is
present
in
the
aroma
is
nowhere
it
be
found
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
a
bit
too
high
and
seems
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
taste
but
only
slightly
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
the
smokestack
series
d
very
high
in
terms
of
flavor
but
the
abv
might
get
you
verdict
while
perhaps
a
little
muddled
harvest
dance
is
tasty
enough
nicely
drinkable
and
pleasantly
different
though
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
it
seems
like
a
solid
start
pours
a
clear
copper
color
one
and
one
half
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
there
is
also
suspended
sediment
present
smells
of
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
hop
hint
of
wheat
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
wheatwine
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
slight
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
hint
of
hops
wheat
alcohol
and
slight
metallic
flavor
overall
good
aroma
body
and
complexity
but
metallic
flavor
hurts
poured
into
a
chalice
glass
48
degrees
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
here
goes
pours
a
dusty
copper
with
an
impressive
head
that
is
fed
by
a
hefty
amount
of
carbonation
smells
of
light
fruity
esters
mingling
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
subtle
amount
of
earthyfloral
hops
noted
as
well
along
with
some
alcohol
noticably
effervescent
in
the
mouth
light
candied
apples
sweet
malts
light
caramelized
sugar
sweetness
black
pepper
and
honey
are
picked
up
in
the
taste
it
is
what
i
imagine
an
imperial
saison
would
taste
like
not
sure
if
such
a
thing
actually
exists
full
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
opens
up
nicely
as
the
head
sttles
down
and
the
beer
warms
up
a
few
degrees
very
interesting
beer
excellent
offering
from
boulevard
who
continue
to
impress
with
their
limited
editions
one
of
the
very
best
smokestack
series
offerings
ive
had
harvest
dance
is
nothing
short
of
outstanding
a
must
try
thanks
to
kris
d
for
introducing
me
to
this
one
overall
this
beer
is
bomb
awesome
very
shocked
that
boulevard
could
pull
off
a
style
that
not
to
many
breweries
make
and
do
it
so
well
i
highly
recommend
this
one
very
drinkable
back
to
the
carbonation
this
beer
looks
carbonated
but
really
is
not
my
girlfriend
who
hates
soda
for
its
carbonation
really
enjoys
this
beer
it
leads
to
an
almost
perfect
drinkability
even
more
so
that
less
powerful
brews
very
drinkable
great
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
flavors
were
similar
apples
and
spice
with
a
supple
feel
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
im
guessing
the
wheat
is
responsible
for
the
mellow
smoothness
for
all
the
crazy
foam
it
had
it
didnt
feel
super
carbonated
overall
it
was
pleasant
light
and
easy
drinking
especially
for
9
1
would
buy
this
again
seems
like
it
would
be
a
nice
autumn
seasonal
thanks
blueokie
strong
carbonation
and
md
light
body
imo
not
very
drinkable
d
dangerously
drinkable
with
the
big
abv
serves
well
as
a
sipper
but
is
light
enough
to
keep
going
back
to
it
nicely
done
750ml
corked
caged
my
first
wheatwine
i
sort
of
expected
something
like
a
barleywine
which
is
to
say
i
expected
no
carbonation
the
healthy
pop
of
the
cork
dense
active
sticky
head
are
a
pleasant
surprise
it
is
a
dark
gold
with
very
active
carbonation
smells
of
honey
hay
a
touch
of
horse
blanket
and
a
vague
citrus
tastes
malty
and
nutty
with
a
slight
acidic
finish
the
aftertaste
is
very
pleasantly
earthy
the
mouthfeel
is
great
sharply
carbonated
and
then
a
light
but
viscous
body
the
drinkability
is
great
the
alcohol
is
just
a
pleasant
warmth
going
down
and
that
earthy
aftertaste
is
just
what
the
dr
ordered
then
he
ordered
me
another
one
then
i
had
a
nap
d
incredibly
drinkable
the
carbonation
holds
it
back
just
a
touch
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
if
this
is
a
true
example
of
the
style
then
i
love
wheatwine
overall
i
liked
the
beer
but
the
carbonation
was
a
little
much
a
little
less
would
have
made
this
one
a
real
pleasure
rich
layers
of
tangerine
flesh
and
grated
lemon
peel
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
a
grassy
almost
soapy
hop
bitterness
and
a
blast
of
ethanol
yeast
alcohol
add
more
fruitiness
to
the
mix
notably
pear
and
granny
smith
apple
i
can
see
the
booziness
being
too
much
for
some
but
for
me
it
borders
on
the
right
side
of
harsh
thankfully
restrained
just
enough
to
add
the
right
amount
of
warmth
and
flavor
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
harvest
dance
has
a
great
mouthfeel
too
slick
and
slightly
chewy
but
light
enough
from
the
carbonation
to
keep
it
at
a
drinkable
level
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipperi
can
feel
the
booze
working
after
half
a
glassbut
its
a
damn
tasty
one
that
i
will
gladly
revisit
as
per
most
of
the
smokestack
series
boulevard
hasnt
missed
a
beat
with
this
wheatwine
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
better
than
most
barleywines
that
ive
tried
definitely
worth
the
search
for
another
bottle
i
havent
had
more
than
a
few
versions
of
this
style
but
this
isnt
what
i
would
consider
one
of
the
best
that
would
go
to
the
portsmouth
version
d
very
good
and
very
interesting
my
first
wheat
wine
too
much
carbonation
imo
still
have
not
been
disappointed
with
a
single
smokestack
series
beer
batch
12009
poured
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
into
my
smokestack
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
burnt
wheat
with
a
massive
4
inch
head
that
just
doesnt
go
away
i
had
to
wait
close
to
5
minutes
just
for
the
head
to
recede
enough
for
some
beer
to
actually
settle
out
as
this
beer
recedes
a
crazy
sticky
lacing
is
left
all
the
way
down
the
glass
if
there
were
a
category
just
for
head
retention
this
would
be
a
5
at
all
times
there
is
a
good
12
inch
hat
resting
on
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
extremely
complex
up
front
is
a
good
mixture
of
the
citra
and
hallertau
hops
mango
pineapple
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
grass
fill
the
nostrils
first
then
comes
the
sweet
orchard
fruit
with
pears
and
red
delicious
apples
sweet
malts
and
belgian
candy
sugar
all
come
together
with
just
a
little
bit
of
dimetapp
the
flavor
profile
is
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
i
just
dont
like
it
as
much
the
hops
are
a
bit
more
subdued
but
still
lend
their
tropical
fruits
overly
ripe
apples
are
abound
along
with
yeasty
biscuits
toast
rolled
together
in
a
classic
wheat
profile
at
the
very
tail
of
the
flavor
profile
the
muscat
grapes
used
to
carbonate
the
beer
really
comes
through
which
leads
to
my
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
its
really
sweet
its
already
a
fairly
sweetsugary
beer
and
the
muscat
grape
juice
just
makes
it
that
much
sweeter
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
such
a
big
beer
and
it
has
a
definitely
effervescent
carbonation
i
love
it
that
boulevard
pushes
the
boundaries
and
im
excited
to
see
them
do
it
with
a
wheat
wine
d
exceptional
drinkability
it
doesnt
taste
boozy
considering
the
9
alcohol
by
volume
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
a
tank
7
tulip
lots
of
carbonation
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
massive
overflowing
head
fantastic
aroma
of
tropical
fruit
along
with
some
citrusy
spice
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
california
sauvignon
blanc
flavor
starts
of
with
some
wheaty
spice
and
more
citrus
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
dry
finish
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
wood
comes
out
a
bit
in
the
finish
as
it
warms
a
very
unique
and
tasty
beer
drinkability
i
split
this
bottle
with
a
few
people
but
i
could
have
drank
the
whole
thing
i
really
enjoy
this
every
time
i
have
it
this
style
really
has
not
grown
on
me
but
this
seems
like
the
cream
of
the
crop
something
i
would
recommend
a
slow
boozy
enjoyable
complex
unique
sipper
pours
orangebrown
with
a
huge
dark
white
head
the
aroma
is
strongly
wheaty
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
as
well
you
get
some
citrus
and
grassy
hops
more
than
expected
the
flavor
is
wheat
with
the
same
earthy
and
citrus
hops
that
were
in
the
nose
you
also
get
some
belgian
yeast
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
and
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
a
sipper
that
changes
both
flavor
and
aroma
as
it
warms
overall
this
is
a
pretty
mellow
beer
surprising
given
the
alcohol
and
nothing
stands
out
like
a
huge
impy
stout
it
is
a
little
far
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
the
pouring
gets
to
be
a
bit
annoying
too
each
pour
i
get
about
an
ounce
of
beer
and
tons
of
head
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
huge
white
head
there
are
also
little
particles
of
sediment
suspended
in
the
liquid
aroma
was
fruity
with
a
belgianlike
spice
taste
is
much
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
very
fruitty
and
citrusy
with
some
spice
and
some
oakiness
another
solid
beer
from
boulevard
in
the
smokestack
series
4
54444
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
another
solid
smokestack
offering
my
first
wheatwine
so
cant
say
how
it
compares
to
others
in
style
but
if
this
is
a
good
representation
then
ive
found
another
style
that
i
love
highly
recommend
rotation
avail
here
in
tx
believe
its
rotating
in
the
series
and
not
a
permanent
member
gonna
try
at
least
one
more
fresh
and
then
get
another
to
cellar
light
to
medium
body
the
overcarbonation
really
detracts
from
the
beer
here
some
alcohol
warmth
overall
this
can
be
a
really
nice
beer
but
the
carbonation
is
too
detracting
got
out
the
duvel
tulip
as
the
boulevard
smokestack
series
all
seem
to
have
enormous
heads
the
tulip
still
wasnt
enough
difficult
to
pour
without
getting
90
head
very
light
body
reminded
me
almost
of
a
grape
wine
with
the
dryness
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
from
the
smokestack
series
so
far
tastes
looks
and
smells
much
like
a
heavily
hopped
and
malted
belgian
wit
which
i
guess
makes
sense
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
d
a
zinger
all
the
way
around
it
is
pretty
potent
in
terms
of
abv
also
i
would
find
that
it
is
a
bit
filling
by
its
strong
carbonation
lastly
the
wild
saison
like
flavors
make
his
beer
a
certain
single
quantity
addition
to
your
evening
wish
i
had
something
to
better
compare
it
but
its
an
enjoyable
brew
and
i
will
gladly
go
finish
off
the
bottle
and
likely
pick
up
again
another
great
smokestack
offering
from
boulevard
tastes
good
feels
good
good
drinkability
not
what
i
expected
from
a
wheat
wine
but
not
bad
smokestack
series
is
always
worth
a
try
my
biggest
knock
on
this
beer
is
the
head
it
was
aggitating
to
pour
a
glass
and
not
even
see
beer
at
the
bottom
the
whole
glass
was
filled
with
head
ive
never
seen
that
before
im
a
barleywine
fan
and
this
did
let
me
down
a
little
by
comparison
i
was
expecting
a
thick
ale
but
unless
boulevard
totally
screwed
this
up
a
wheatwine
is
not
too
thick
still
this
was
enjoyable
and
i
wish
i
would
have
drank
it
during
early
fall
where
i
could
see
it
really
hitting
the
spot
drinks
fairly
easy
for
the
style
abv
great
offering
from
boulevard
one
of
the
better
takes
on
this
style
ive
had
this
is
my
only
experience
with
a
wheat
wine
but
i
am
certainly
going
to
look
for
more
as
this
was
quite
enjoyable
color
is
slightly
hazy
orangish
yellow
pours
with
a
huge
amount
of
head
but
most
of
it
dissapates
quickly
and
only
a
small
amount
lasted
through
the
first
few
sips
the
nose
on
this
one
came
across
as
tons
of
pineapple
finished
off
with
some
grassy
notes
and
a
little
peppery
spice
tastes
like
honey
mixed
with
what
i
imagine
fresh
cut
grass
would
taste
like
toss
in
some
black
pepper
hops
are
definitely
present
but
not
up
front
as
is
the
case
with
most
barley
wines
really
nice
complexity
as
it
finishes
with
a
variety
of
different
spicy
notes
lingering
on
the
palate
the
biggest
surprise
to
me
was
the
lightness
of
body
of
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
much
heavier
considering
the
alcohol
content
overall
this
was
a
great
buy
just
like
all
of
the
smokestack
series
purchases
i
have
made
so
far
highly
drinkable
possibly
dangerously
so
at
9
1
i
strongly
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
d
very
different
im
still
surprised
this
is
a
wheatwine
for
sure
but
i
do
enjoy
it
so
hard
to
complain
wow
a
wonderful
wheatwine
that
has
a
uniquely
belgianesk
twist
to
it
and
warms
the
soul
quickly
with
a
nice
complexity
boulevard
continues
to
create
incredibly
nice
brews
for
the
smokestack
series
harvest
dance
will
makes
your
palate
do
just
that
dance
d
very
nice
abv
feels
much
lower
than
whats
stated
on
the
bottle
this
drinks
like
a
beer
with
half
the
strength
another
smokestack
series
winner
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
stiff
off
white
head
that
resists
fading
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
interesting
grainy
wheat
sweet
malt
earthy
yeast
this
one
has
it
all
very
fruity
crazy
complex
with
an
unimaginable
balance
that
stems
from
tha
vanilla
oaky
notes
scoring
points
the
mouth
feel
is
effervescent
tangy
and
creamy
soft
very
light
to
style
full
flavored
the
classic
grain
and
oak
treatment
persist
a
really
fine
drinker
the
9
abv
is
well
integrated
great
job
on
your
20
boulevard
this
is
admittingly
the
first
wheatwine
ive
ever
had
poured
into
a
wineglass
orange
with
a
huge
thick
head
most
of
this
head
can
be
contributed
to
me
having
just
bought
it
and
it
was
rolling
around
in
the
car
but
the
head
had
great
staying
value
and
great
lacing
the
smell
was
of
orange
and
grapefruit
scents
which
is
what
the
taste
was
like
being
my
first
wheatwine
i
can
best
compare
it
to
a
belgian
ipa
without
the
belgian
yeast
and
more
of
a
straw
dry
feel
in
the
mouthfeel
very
interesting
750ml
bottle
9
nice
orange
color
with
a
superfoamy
head
i
was
actually
surprised
how
much
this
one
foamed
up
the
smell
was
kind
of
weird
like
a
belgian
style
beer
strange
and
i
wasnt
too
impressed
the
flavor
had
some
tropical
fruit
just
as
the
label
noted
but
overall
it
was
kind
of
boring
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
and
alcohol
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
revisit
but
i
will
always
give
the
smokestack
beers
a
whirl
extremely
complex
though
subtle
exceptional
balance
another
unique
and
enjoyable
release
from
boulevard
whose
smokestack
series
has
become
one
of
the
most
prolific
big
beer
series
in
the
industry
cant
wait
to
taste
one
after
some
time
in
the
cellar
move
over
wheelsucker
this
is
now
my
favorite
wheat
wine
d
pretty
good
im
wondering
what
is
up
with
all
the
esters
in
my
bottle
and
the
huge
head
that
blew
up
it
has
been
in
the
fridge
since
i
bought
it
about
a
week
ago
so
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
storing
it
oh
well
i
guess
it
was
delicious
none
the
less
as
with
the
rest
of
the
smokestacks
the
carbonation
is
huge
so
be
careful
pouring
head
is
fairly
thick
and
bubbly
and
the
color
is
reddishorange
retention
is
excellent
and
a
thick
somewhat
crackled
lacing
is
left
behind
aroma
involves
the
obvious
malt
and
wheat
as
well
as
a
sharp
citrisy
notes
that
strike
at
the
end
some
spice
and
a
slight
sourness
tastes
of
pure
wheat
more
spice
and
fruits
and
a
yeasty
base
with
some
slightly
sweet
malts
enveloping
it
all
and
a
middle
layer
of
bitterness
that
finishes
things
off
to
near
perfection
goes
down
crisp
with
a
nice
little
alcohol
heat
lingering
in
the
throat
boulevard
can
seem
to
do
no
wrong
these
days
and
this
is
a
tasty
and
unique
addition
to
an
already
stellar
lineup
this
beer
has
a
flavor
that
i
have
never
experienced
before
it
is
almost
like
white
grapes
and
papaya
with
tons
of
fruity
bitter
hops
and
sweet
barley
the
new
citra
hops
are
really
nice
and
the
wheat
helps
to
enhance
the
fruity
flavor
the
oak
adds
a
very
subtle
dryness
and
can
be
tasted
slightly
during
the
sip
the
color
is
a
mix
between
gold
brown
and
orange
with
a
very
thick
white
head
the
head
will
actually
come
out
of
the
glass
without
pouring
over
the
sides
the
beer
smells
like
white
grape
juice
and
wheat
mixed
together
beer
as
innovative
as
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
love
drinking
so
much
i
recommend
stocking
up
on
this
beer
and
let
it
age
incredible
this
is
my
first
foray
into
this
style
but
im
impressed
its
complex
rich
but
not
overly
heavy
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
noticeable
even
for
a
9
abv
beer
ah
now
this
is
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
wheatwine
so
much
more
flavor
and
complexity
than
the
last
disaster
of
the
style
that
i
tried
honestly
i
dont
see
this
one
getting
much
better
over
time
so
i
say
drink
them
now
d
high
alcohol
is
covered
well
flavor
is
intense
but
very
drinkable
dnot
something
i
would
drink
alot
of
or
alot
of
the
time
but
a
beer
like
this
is
one
i
tend
to
want
when
the
mood
strikes
and
nothing
else
will
do
a
nice
steak
dinner
with
this
would
be
amazing
body
is
highly
carbonated
but
really
supports
the
bittereness
and
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
medium
body
and
really
does
well
to
hide
the
9
1
abv
truly
good
pretty
tasty
and
though
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
its
likely
a
pretty
fair
example
of
it
the
whole
package
is
a
good
way
to
close
out
the
season
drink
taste
alone
make
this
wheat
wine
super
drinkable
though
it
does
seem
at
taste
to
be
slightly
more
boozy
than
it
is
that
could
deter
some
for
drinkability
but
this
beer
is
damn
fine
boulevard
have
proven
themselves
time
and
again
to
be
masters
of
wheat
they
just
know
how
to
make
it
do
great
things
harvest
dance
wheat
wine
is
no
exception
its
insanely
flavored
yet
very
balanced
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
but
also
very
complex
this
is
fantastic
you
really
must
obtain
some
drink
some
and
age
some
this
is
my
only
second
wheat
wine
style
beer
the
other
was
75th
streets
wheat
wine
so
when
i
poured
this
i
thought
it
would
be
darker
and
sweeter
appearance
is
brighter
than
i
expected
almost
copper
color
amberish
i
can
see
a
bit
of
suspended
yeast
and
it
is
a
bit
cloudy
i
absolutely
love
the
smell
i
can
definitely
pick
out
the
citra
hops
as
i
am
a
regular
drinker
of
sn
torpedo
which
is
the
only
other
beer
i
know
that
has
this
new
hop
the
taste
is
very
belgium
blond
to
me
i
can
pick
up
the
sweet
wheat
malt
all
over
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
like
i
think
this
beer
is
overcarbed
to
my
liking
i
like
the
beer
but
it
is
not
one
ill
pick
up
very
often
d
tastes
fine
but
the
excessive
carbonation
takes
away
as
youll
be
belching
frequently
drinkability
ill
be
back
d
this
is
a
very
good
wheatwine
i
is
delicious
and
surprisingly
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
so
soft
it
feels
more
delicate
than
it
really
is
carbonation
has
a
tight
density
as
stated
the
retained
head
adds
to
the
creamy
smooth
texture
boulevard
has
another
outstanding
beer
here
they
do
extreme
beers
extremely
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
nice
brew
or
maybe
i
realize
i
just
dont
like
wheatwines
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
wheatwine
while
it
is
not
especially
complex
i
feel
like
it
has
a
lot
to
offer
dark
apple
juice
look
smells
fruity
and
malty
tastes
sweet
caramel
like
some
fruitiness
and
booze
and
maybe
some
honey
in
there
slight
bitter
finish
good
thick
body
good
buy
for
the
5
bucks
i
paid
downright
excellent
i
love
wheatwine
but
a
good
wheatwine
isnt
usually
real
high
on
most
breweries
todo
list
amazingly
spicy
complex
fruit
notes
and
a
good
shot
of
citrus
hops
are
plentiful
but
subtly
chosen
so
as
not
to
overpower
the
wheat
base
of
the
beer
wheatwine
lovers
should
not
pass
this
one
up
fullsail
continues
to
be
a
damn
solid
brewery
keep
it
coming

there
is

the

quite
well
done
and
enjoyable
this
had
such
a
good
price
i
put
off
buying
it
but
will
go
back
for
more
bottles
because
it
appears
to
have
good
cellaring
possibilties
and
if
it
develops
well
will
be
a
great
value
im
fond
of
full

full

have
found
the

to
be

small

wheat
caramel
brown

some

taste
is
much
the

with
a
medium
amount

with

sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
the
smell
is
better
than
the
taste
i
love
this
beer
maybe
my
favorite
wheat
wine
poured
a
nice
medium
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
white
foam
on

big
aromas
here
with
cotton
candy
pear
some
light

and
caramel
on
the
palate
this
one
is
big
boozy
and
syrupy
but
in
a
very
good
way
with
big
cotton
candy
flavors
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
i
easily
finished
the
glass
and
at
over
10
abv
thats
a
scary
thing
d
the
best
wheatwine
ive
had
though
i
havent
had
much
of
the
style
very
drinkable
high
alcohol
brew
da
sipper
for
sure
much
akin
to
a
brandy
like
beer
a
late
night
wintertime
fireside
brew
pours
a
deep
clear
copper
with
lasting
tan
head
ring
and
sheet
lacing
the
aroma
is
big
with
dark
fruity
esters
caramel
and
mild
alcohol
phenols
the
taste
begins
with
a
welcoming
thick
viscous
sludgy
sensation
that
ushers
in
loads
of
fruity
esters
like
cherries
dates
raisins
and
faint
pepper
it
also
comes
across
as
mildly
hot
a
boat
load
of
fruity
esters
really
showing
up
throughout
could
use
more
age
but
at
this
age
it
is
still
yummy
d
pretty
good
much
better
than
last
years
version
which
tasted
medicinal
i
give
it
a
good
drinkability
because
i
enjoy
a
thick
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
however
some
wouldnt
call
this
a
drinkable
beer
it
is
an
absolute
sipper
and
8oz
will
do
just
fine
an
excellent
brew
and
an
excellent
introduction
for
me
to
this
style
highly
recommended
a
deep
ruby
with
golden
brown
highlights
with
just
a
light
dusting
of
head
a
strong
alcohol
aroma
and
hoppy
onetwo
punch
in
the
nose
the
alcohol
contents
warming
effects
are
noticeable
but
there
is
also
flavors
not
unlike
fruit
punch
with
a
slightly
grainy
kick
to
it
goes
down
easy
but
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
night
seems
like
too
much
of
a
great
thing
very
highly
recommended
along
with
rubicons
other
yearly
strong
ale
the

there
is
a

has
a

this
is
a

nothing

a

some

syrupy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
miles
ahead
of
the
last
time
i
had
it
my
score
reflects
this
tasting
wheat
wine
interesting
with
all
the
diacetyl
i
dont
get
much
wheat
at
all
i
can
see
where
they
are
coming
from
with
the
high
alcohol
and
sweetness
of
a
wheat
wine
though
interesting
overall
a
nice
complex
and
hot
sipper
i
like
wheatwines
and
this
one
holds
up
as
another
highly
recommended
brew
from
portsmouth
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
it
was
my
favorite
from
what
i
tried
in
my
recent
visit
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
average
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
of
the
style
and
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
it
also
helps
that
im
a
big
wheatwine
fan
as
well
o
i
guess
its
not
bad
but
i
have
yet
to
have
a
beer
of
this
style
that
blows
me
away
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
many
but
not
something
id
ever
try
to
find
again
this
wheat
wine
was
very
refreshing
as
it
differed
pretty
nicely
from
the
barleywines
notes
of
citrus
honey
and
a
somewhat
floral
bouquet
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
great
taste
but
can
taste
the
alcohol
coming
through
my
wife
would
really
like
this
one
wouldnt
mind
having
one
again
d
the
10
was
a
pretty
good
wheatwine
a
style
that
i
dont
generally
find
very
exciting
the
09
had
unfortunate
similarities
to
the
10
bare
tree
from
two
brothers
although
it
wasnt
nearly
as
awful
while
the
10
is
one
of
the
better
portsmouth
offerings
ive
had
its
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
or
highly
recommend
still
the
wellhidden
alcohol
and
inoffensive
flavor
led
me
to
have
a
second
pour
lush
and
velvety
creamy
feel
with
a
sweet
toffee
aftertaste
that
additionally
has
a
somewhat
mellow
bitterness
very
drinkable
almost
perilously
so
in
the
words
of
the
late
michael
jackson
overall
a
really
solid
wheat
wine
nice
flavors
and
a
good
drinkability
a
must
try
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
slighlty
hazy
copper
color
with

sweet

notes

mediumheavy
mouthfeel
with
slight
mouthfeel
nice
lace
on
the
glass
very
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
caramel
and
orange
its
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
with
nice
flavors
some
banana
as
well
the
alcohol
is
surprisingly
mild
in
the
flavor
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
split
between
5
people
was
the
perfect
amount
as
i
think
the
sweetness
may
become
a
little
overpowering
with
bigger
pours

10
ounces
is
plenty
at
the
end
of
this
session
strength
and
thickness
of
the
body
limit
this
beer
d
i
wish
there
were
more
examples
of
this
style
out
there
this
is
the
second
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
them
very
nice
brown
pretty
cloudy
with
a
thin
head
and
some
lace
the
smell
is
of
blueberries
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
some
heavier
alcohols
propanol
for
example
the
taste
is
interesting
a
bit
sour
almost
more
like
a
wild
ale
than
a
sweet
wheat
wine
the
malt
character
is
somewhat
restrained
i
do
notice
a
fair
amount
of
caramel
malt
but
it
is
pretty
one
dimensional
and
a
bit
syrupy
bitterness
seems
to
be
limited
only
to
the
sourness
and
not
really
much
from
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
clean
it
does
finish
quite
tingly
and
a
little
puckering
im
not
sure
what
is
going
on
with
this
one
perhaps
ive
got
a
bad
bottle
because
it
doesnt
seem
to
match
what
others
have
said
in
their
reviews
it
is
different
and
still
enjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
glad
to
get
the
chance
to
try
it
all
the
same
d
the
sourness
kept
this
from
being
cloying
but
it
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
this
one
needs
to
head
back
to
gabf
this
year
great
job

it

with

one
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
no
noticeable

was
a
slightly

orange
amber
aroma
was
slightly

maybe
fig
or
prune
hints
of
alcohol
were
detectable
along
with
bits
of
wheaty
grain
taste
was
up
front
sweet
but
not
in
a
sugary
syrupy
sweet
way
spiciness
tended
to
end
the
sip
maybe
some
pepper
felt
outstanding
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
felt
great
in
the
mouth
hid
the
alcohol
nicely
but
still
a
sipping
beer
extremely
pleasant
mellow
beer
overall
a
very
nice
solid
beer
not
really
my
prefered
cup
of
tea
but
very
solid
none
the
less
another
solid
offering
from
portsmouth
the
appearance
was
coppery
hazey
and
golden
with
moderate
eggshell
colored
head
the
bourbon
brown
sugar
candied
fruit
and
slight
maltiness
in
the
aroma
actually
reminded
me
of
a
scotch
ale
the
taste
was
a
little
syrupy
and
a
little
boozey
but
was
true
to
the
smell
with
noticeable
yeast
and
sweet
fruit
and
a
nice
caramel
hint
the
mouthfeel
was
also
a
little
syrupy
but
overall
very
pleasant
drinkability
was
average
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
for
the
abv
a
very
nice
beer
overall
overall
my
first
experience
with
this
style
was
pleasant
and
enjoyable
great
flavors
and
a
stellar
mouthfeel
really
made
this
a
standout
in
my
mind
it
is
worth
noting
that
when
this
beer
was
released
i
found
it
almost
undrinkable
on
draft
it
was
hot
and
almost
overly
malty
sweet
by
the
end
of
its
time
on
draft
i
started
to
enjoy
it
and
now
the
bottle
is
really
coming
into
its
own
after
a
few
months
pours
a
medium
brown
with
tints
of
amber
and
a
thin
beige
head

has
sugary
malts
citrus

grassy
hops

dark

drinks
very
easy
for
the

thanks
joe
ive
never
been
disappointed
with
portsmouth
offerings
and
i
really
mean
never
but
this
one
is
a
little
off
the
mark
not
sure
if
theres
a
capping
problem
or
an
inherent
flaw
or
the
toffee
thing
again
but
something
leaves
this
wanting
quite
a
bit
heft
makes
it
tough
to
plunder
through
the
whole
bomber
even
after
stopping
this
up
with
a
wine
stopper
and
reopening
what
im
left
with
is
a
decent
example
for
the
style
but
not
the
excellence
im
used
to
from
portsmouth
for
the
weight
class
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
meek
maybe
theres
not
a
cappingbottling
issue
but
the
offflavor
butter
toffee
or

at

burned
off
after

still
its

for
mere
mortals
as

as
the
pure
question
of
how
well
it

for

if
you
see
it
try
it
d
overall
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
wheat
wine
initially
i
thought
it
might
be
too
sweet
given
that
this
was
brewed
with
maple
syrup
however
the
utilization
of
the
hefe
yeast
gave
this
a
spicy
twist
and
countered
the
sweetness
and
fruitiness
quite
nicely
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
so
ive
rated
it
fairly
similarly
to
a
barleywine
age
has
treated
this
well
with
the
flavors
much
less
harsh
and
no
signs
of
oxidation
it
must
have
been
reasonably
hopped
when
freshed
considering
the
amount
of
bitterness
present
but
no
aromaflavor
carried
through
fairly
wellbalanced
for
such
a

i
really
wish

about
this
one

so
long
and
got
to
try
it

overall
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
it
has
some
very

i
think
it
bit
off
more
than
it
can
chew
hands
down
the
best
best
brew
ive
had
from
ft
collins
and
a
tasty

in
its
own
right
a
sweet

boozy
treat
that
i

would
only
get
better

a

and
a

that
doesnt
interfere

carbonation
is
moderate
body
is
pretty
close

and
the

very

and
easily
recommended
notes
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
beer
flavors
fell
flat
for
me
and
didnt
inspire
me
to
drink
more
not
exactly
cloying
but
sweet
sticky
and
alcoholic
i
would
recommend
treating
this
like
a
brandy
and
have
someone
or
someones
to
share
this
with
for
a
dessertnightcapetc
a
typical
kind
of
us
beer
some
nice
flavours
but
not
quite
big
and
impressive
and
idiosyncratic
enough
almost
as
if
the
flavours
are
thrown
together
without
them
quite
knowing
what
to
do
with
them
this
beer
is
too
sweet
and
could
use
some
more
hops
akin
to
an
imperial
red
less
the
hops
overall
reminds
me
of
an
english
barleywine
with
not
as
heavy
of
a
body
i
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of

wheat
fruit
flavors
more
caramel
still
quite
a
tasty
beer
even
if
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
eh
its
ok
but
it
really
needs
some
sort
of
purpose
and
it
doesnt
have
it
it
makes
me
wonder
why
im
drinking
it
and
thats
never

not
sure
about
the
wine
labeling
as
this
fullbodied
ale
has
little
to
do
with
either
wine
or
barley
wine
but
offers
exceptional
body
balance
and
flavor
from
a
wheatbased
brew
and
is
the
best
and
most
flavorful
i
have
tasted
from
wheat
in
a
full
alestyle
i
would
highly
recommend
this
both
as
an
ale
and
for
its
novelty
if
you
can
find
it
as
i
have
been
informed
by
my
retailer
that
it
is
no
longer
available
or
being
made
o
this
beer
is
delicious
but
honestly
its
closer
to
an
ipa
or
barleywine
due
to
the
high
bitterness
and
lack
of
wheat
flavor
so
points
are

wheatwine
not
in
love
with
this
one
doubtfull
i
would
go
for
it
again
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
quite
quaffable
and
uncomplicated
not
something
i
would
go
after
too
frequently
and
you
need
to
watch
the
abv
because
it
sneaks
up
on
you
but
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
for
a
change
of
pace
beer
is
thin
and
super
dry
at
the
finish
this
is
where
i
got
confused
because
this
isnt
a
barleywine
it
is
sweet
at
the
get
go
but
the
midpalate
flavors
fall
flat
and
flounder
a
bit
nothing
going
on
in
the
back
except
this
astringent
grainy
acidity
and
cotton
mouth
harsh
all
around
pours
a
clear
bright
light
copper
color
with
a
moderatelythick
offwhite
head
doesnt
last
long
falling
to
a
thin
ring
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
is
pretty
sweet
with
some
light
cherry
and
a
bit
of
caramel
has
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
start
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
light
pittype
fruits
and
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
light
amount
of
boozenot
too
much
heavy
bitterness
starts
to
take
over
a
bit
really
dry
finish
flavor
doesnt
have
enough
character
and
the
body
isnt
big
enough
but
american
barleywine
seems
to
be
the
closest
fit
personally
i
could
use
a
little
more
maltiness
to
balance
out
the
hops
and
alcohol
but
seeing
as
how
wheat
isnt
nearly
as
chewy
as
barley
i
suppose
that
means
this
is
decent
for
the
style
even
still
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
happily
drink
it
again
o
i
have
to
admit
i
am
not
familiar
with
wheat
wine
but
if
this
is
indicative
of
the
style
i
think
i
will
try
different
ones
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
wheat
wine
and
it
has
a
great
aroma
missing
a
little
bit
in
the
taste
department
otherwise
a
nice
example
of
the
style
o
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
it
just
seems
like
it
was
missing
a
lot
of
malt
and
the
alcohol
dominated
the
taste
i
thought
this
might
be
a
really
interesting
beer
i
was
wrong
it
tasted
more
like
a
miller
lite
wanting
to
be
a
barleywine
i
dont
know
i
guess
i
saw
what
they
were
aiming
for
but
they
were
quite
far
away
there
isnt
much
to
this
beer
except
for
a
decent
abv
and
a
taste
similar
to
some
not
so
well
prepared
grainy
soup
served
cold
im
being
a
bit
harsh
but
i
was
let
down
especially
for
the
money
i
threw
away
on
it
do
yourself
get
a
4
pack
of
uintas
barleywine
for
the
same
price
as
22oz
of
this
crap
or
do
yourself
a
better
one
if
you
want
something
great
get
jw
lees
harvest
ale
dont
try
this
guy
fort
collins
wheat
wine
ale
is
a
fairly
standard
version
of
the
style
circa
20102011
america
if
youre
a
fan
of
highoctane
primarily
palemalted
beer
take
the
plunge
besides
6
99
is
unlikely
to
break
the
bank
bomber
pours
brilliantly
clear
copper
with
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
fruity
and
just
as
much
fusel
like
notes
as
anything
else
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
malty
and
fruitiness
coming
from
plums
cherries
and
raisins
with
mild
to
somehow
harsh
booziness
around
the
edges
pretty
nice
albeit
young
brew
i
think
i
need
to
age
some
d
this
is
the
first
wheatwine
that
ive
been
able
to
try
i
thought
there
would
be
a
large
difference
between
a
wheatwine
and
a
barelywine
but
there
doesnt
appear
to
be
much
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
ill
have
to
try
some
other
wheatwine
style
beers
before
i
can
fully
grade
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
in
my
opinion
too
thin
for
the
size
of
the
malt
bill
and
alcohol
id
prefer
a
real
barleywine
and
for
the
most
part
think
i
can
say
i
dont
need
this
again
but
its
an
interesting
take
on
an
unusual
style
and
it
turns
out
pretty
well
no
need
to
beat
a
dead
horse
had
this
one
on
tap
at
oskar
blues
liquids
and
solids
in
longmont
yesterday
poured
a
rich
medium
amber
color
with
a
little
light
tan
head
aromas
of
caramel
candied
apples
and
light
brown
sugar
full
bodied
and
syrupy
on
the
palate
way
too
sweet
with
candied
apples
caramel
and
booze
disappointing
for
a
beer
with
a
50
wheat
malt
bill
it
does
surprise
me
that
theres
a
minimal
amount
of
traditionally
wheat
flavors
though
still
i
like
it
color
is
clear
reddish
amber
with
noticeable
carbonation
fair
head
retention
sweet
aroma
of
apples
and
caramel
very
very
soft
up
front
almost
no
carbonation
evident
alcohol
in
the
middle
but
not
as
hot
as
a
barley
wine
very
sweet
almost
scottish
ale
like
smooth
finish
bitterness
builds
after
the
finish
very
rich
body
definitely
a
winter
drink
it
pours
a
clear
ruby
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
light
toffee
earthy
hops
flowers
light
fusels
coriander
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
a
strong
dichotomy
of
peppery
toffee
and
flowery
orange
peel
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
a
decently
solid
wheatwine
though
it
is
lacking
in
complexity
and
the
two
flavor
groups
seem
to
clash
a
bit
despite
that
it
keeps
me
wanting
more
and
coming
back
for
it
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
little
yeastywheaty
not
strong
but
still
appealing
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
golden
amber
with
a
substantial
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
flavor
woo
hoo
has
it
got
an
alcohol
bite
to
it
other
than
that
it
tastes
more
like
an
ale
than
a
wheat
beer
fruity
malty
and
a
little
bit
yeasty
texture
is
smooth
as
soy
milk
with
a
subtle
but
longlasting
tingle
notes
wow
you
know
some
beers
can
surprise
you
this
one
smells
great
and
like
a
thick
chewy
monster
but
on
the
palate
its
really
light
and
mostly
a
let
down
smuttynose
set
the
bar
really
high
for
this
style
i
think
ive
loved
just
about
everything
else
from
fcb
but
this
is
disappointing
bummer
d
this
beer
has
a
muted
flavor
but
what
is
there
is
pleasant
just
a
bit
bland
i
was
hoping
for
more
depth
or
more
richness
in
a
wheat
wine
but
it
just
wasnt
there
d
meh
couldnt
finish
a
glass
mouth
feel
is
not
that
carbonated
and
slightly
drying
alcohol
is
warming
this
beer
might
benefit
from
aging
this
is
full
in
body
and
taste
definitely
a
good
sipper
and
one
to
appreciate
i
like
wheat
wines
but
i
dont
love
them
rather
have
a
real
barleywine
thank
you
very
much
but
this
is
a
welcome
twist
easy
on
the
palate
plump
with
palpable
flavor
rich
and
rewarding
mmmm
mmm
pretty
good
more
of
an
american
barleywine
i
dont
get
any
wheat
character
here
though
it
is
still
a
good
beer
something
that
is
worth
a
try
d
enjoyable
but
far
from
the
best
in
the
style
worth
a
try
i
loved
drinking
this
and
felt
it
was
a
great
representation
of
the
style
wish
it
was
locally
available
in
boston
i
will
continue
my
exploration
of
this
style
d
good
drinkability
perfect
style
for
splitting
with
friends
and
sipping
on
not
a
session
brew
obviously
too
strong
abv
wise
and
too
strong
a
flavor
profile
for
all
night
drinking
a
great
food
pairing
beer
perhaps
a
savory
pork
chop
or
ribeye
drenched
in
a1
dpretty
easy
drinking
for
a
higher
abv
beer
i
really
like
the
fact
that
its
it
got
that
distinct
barleywine
flavor
profile
but
its
a
lighter
toned
down
version
this
was
a
style
i
had
never
tried
before
and
so
i
was
very
compelled
to
give
it
a
shot
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
it
pours
a
clear
reddish
copper
with
a
thin
fizzy
cream
colored
head
the
nose
is
loaded
with
sweet
citrus
caramel
malts
and
orange
the
palate
was
bready
but
not
yeasty
very
viscous
mouthfeel
that
kinda
coats
your
mouth
with
sweet
malts
the
hops
show
throgh
in
the
finish
contrasting
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
yet
it
finishes
firm
and
a
little
hot
d
less
wheat
than
wine
mouthfeel
is
a
downfall
and
flavor
is
less
complex
than
it
could
be
drinkability
is
good
with
this
being
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
style
and
still
packs
a
punch
overall
lots
of
different
notes
here
but
they
dont
play
well
together
and
arent
much
to
my
liking
sweet
rich
malty
fruitiness
with
hints
of
spice
bread
and
hints
of
sherry
like
oxidation
nice
sipper
but
headed
down
the
other
side
of
the
bell
curve
o
nice
spicy
hoppy
wheat
wine
hoppiness
keeps
this
one
from
being
too
onenote
and
bland
this
really
isnt
far
from
a
big
american
barleywine
if
im
honest
like
bigfoot
just
extra
wheaty
i
suppose
tasty
very
bold
without
getting
in
our
faces
too
much
this
is
a
massive
ale
but
thats
expected
for
this
style
a
style
that
is
still
being
defined
cheers
to
marin
brewing
co
for
not
hopping
the
crap
out
of
this
wheatwine
the
massive
malt
backbone
is
the
showcase
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
drop
well
obviously
i
suck
at
reviewing
wheatwines
because
im
not
pulling
much
out
of
this
guy
besides
an
all
encompassing
citrus
and
alcohol
i
like
it
overall
need
more
wheatwines
apparently
kojevergas
thanks
bud
high
b
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
didnt
blow
me
away
a
solid
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
o
the
banana
aspect
to
it
is
interesting
and
well
on
this
side
of
overwhelming
id
appreciate
a
bit
more
complexity
but
its
totally
satisfying
more
of
a
tripel
than
a
wheat
quite
drinkable
if
you
like
a
strong
wheat
flavor
much
less
sweet
and
hoppy
than
typical
barley
wines
reminds
me
of
the
honey
flavor
of
mead
from
the
22
oz
bottle
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
not
sure
if
it
would
be
a
goto
but
if
its
on
the
menu
and
you
got
the
cash
go
for
it
this
is
one
hefty
lovely
sweet
complex
mofo
of
a
brew
just
how
a
wheatwine
should
taste
a
standardbearer
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
had
to
date
an
excellent
allaround
beer
overall
a
good
beer
and
certainly
the
best
of
the
few
examples
ive
had
of
the
style
boozy
but
also
quite
sweet
and
tasty
had
to
pick
this
up
at
the
novato
ca
bevmo
as
i
cannot
get
it
across
the
bay
snifter
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
hazy
apricot
colored
ale
and
a
nice
fluffy
cream
colored
foamy
head
the
aroma
consists
of
butterscotch
dried
apricots
slight
orange
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
each
whiff
the
taste
is
fruity
almost
like
biting
into
a
juicy
fruit
a
blast
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
are
produced
together
the
label
states
it
is
sherrylike
and
i
do
not
disagree
there
are
some
wheatish
characteristics
which
is
to
be
expected
but
very
subdued
there
is
also
a
dull
grapefruit
aftertaste
that
stays
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
overall
i
wish
i
could
get
this
closer
to
home
but
it
is
definitely
worth
the
scenic
drive
to
bring
a
few
bottles
home
this
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
some
but
it
is
a
refreshing
change
to
the
mass
of
beers
produced
great
beer
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
whitishorange
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
nice
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
citrus
fruits
especially
oranges
orange
juice
and
some
honey
notes
taste
is
of
citrus
zest
orange
juice
and
honey
flavors
very
nice
smells
and
tastes
with
this
one
there
is
a
slightly
acidic
quality
that
hits
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
the
first
wheatwine
i
have
ever
had
i
think
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
and
i
will
definitely
get
more
of
these
going
forward
o
not
bad
probably
one
of
the
better
wheatwines
ive
had
but
the
bar
really
wasnt
set
that
high
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
aroma
is
earthy
hints
of
honey
bready
notes
touches
of
light
grass
and
a
pear
like
fruit
note
nothing
really
coming
out
at
me
as
being
terribly
strong
flavor
was
somewhat
similar
with
a
light
earthy
taste
and
a
smooth
and
even
profile
but
just
nothing
really
breaking
through
on
me
as
being
out
of
the
ordinary
light
grape
flavor
in
the
finish
with
a
honey
like
flavor
left
on
the
palate
star
brew
triple
wheat
ale
pours
an
absolutely
pristine
clear
orange
a
hard
pour
results
in
about
four
fingers
of
bone
colored
head
retention
is
alright
but
lacing
is
practically
nonexistent
the
beer
smells
exactly
like
candied
orange
peel
theres
a
nonspecific
sweetness
that
plays
nicely
against
the
zesty
citrus
hop
notes
the
flavor
takes
that
basic
profile
and
just
refines
it
what
was
a
general
sugary
sweetness
can
now
be
described
as
a
healthy
dose
of
honey
with
just
a
swirl
of
caramel
to
keep
things
interesting
its
enough
to
take
the
bite
off
of
any
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
leave
things
open
for
the
finish
orange
is
joined
by
suggestions
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
as
well
as
some
pale
fruits
that
theres
also
a
subtle
but
definite
heat
from
alcohol
on
the
back
end
its
not
loud
enough
to
ruin
my
enjoyment
the
beer
but
is
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
truly
great
the
body
is
nice
and
middle
of
the
road
neither
especially
rich
nor
thin
the
carbonation
though
barely
registers
and
results
in
the
beer
coming
across
as
a
bit
syrupy
star
brew
triple
wheat
ale
is
a
slightly
different
drinking
experience
and
one
thats
somewhat
enjoyable
despite
its
slight
flaws
o
a
solid
brew
and
i
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
however
i
feel
it
is
a
few
notches
below
a
worldclass
beer
22oz
bottle
pours
slightly
hazy
with
a
pillowtop
offwhite
foam
nice
carbonation
aroma
has
some
cardboard
grape
or
something
fruity
grass
and
something
that
smells
like
horseradish
taste
is
sweet
with
some
light
hop
bitterness
the
beer
is
a
bit
hoti
think
thats
where
the
horseradish
or
whatever
it
is
is
coming
from
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
smooth
but
hot
a
decent
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
going
on
pours
an
orange
color
with
bubbles
constantly
rising
so
thats
a
good
sign
high
lacing
with
grapefruit
aromas
notes
of
orange
on
the
tongue
after
the
alcohol
burn
wears
off
which
is
about
2
seconds
if
it
werent
for
the
burn
id
swear
i
was
drinking
orange
soda
at
9
2
this
is
a
good
sipper
since
the
fruity
aspects
hide
that
hazy
golden
hue
with
two
finger
white
head
sweet
sugar
alcohol
aromas
theres
some
sherry
wine
aroma
in
there
too
theres
some
wood
aroma
too
wood
soaked
in
sherry
the
sherry
flavors
dominate
this
rather
smooth
concoction
nice
mild
carbonation
smooth
tropical
fruit
melon
flavors
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
but
not
as
much
as
previous
batches
unfortunately
theres
no
bottle
date
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
this
particular
bottle
seems
rather
tame
usually
the
sherrywine
flavors
are
too
strong
this
is
actually
pretty
damn
good
its
not
sticky
the
malt
comes
through
pretty
good
almost
like
burnt
grain
but
not
smokey
the
wine
and
melon
flavors
are
a
really
good
combination
for
such
a
big
beer
this
one
is
really
mellow
good
for
sipping
id
like
to
buy
another
one
and
age
heavy
and
sweet
but
very
delectable
recommended
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
find
myself
with
a
good
buzz
after
the
first
half
of
my
22oz
bomber
the
flavors
are
much
more
complex
than
youd
expect
from
the
average
wheat
beer
definitely
a
beer
you
should
try
especially
considering
the
modest
price
d
frankly
i
had
given
up
on
wheatwines
looking
over
my
reviews
i
only
seemed
to
like
one
example
that
ive
tried
and
i
didnt
like
the
next
years
version
nearly
as
well
thanks
to
beerrun13
for
restoring
my
faith
this
is
a
gem
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
golden
color
with
generous
white
head
nose
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
snap
to
it
but
otherwise
has
some
pepper
and
bready
notes
sugary
dessert
flavors
are
noted
on
the
palate
also
reminds
me
of
cardamom
and
cookies
alcohol
presence
is
again
noted
though
it
is
still
syrupy
and
enjoyable
finish
is
sweet
and
herbal
good
beer
but
a
bit
harsh
bright
transparent
yellowgold
with
a
small
white
head
lots
of
sugary
malt
mild
wheat
spice
a
bit
of
caramel
flavor
is
a
tad
sweet
boozy
and
bitter
also
rich
and
finishes
fairly
clean
and
dry
not
nearly
as
sticky
as
it
could
be
pretty
good
beer
and
i
can
see
raising
my
scores
in
the
future
id
recommend
giving
it
some
time
in
the
glass
to
warm
up
and
lose
some
carbonation
pours
a
nice
lightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
little
offwhite
head
very
nice
aromas
of
sweet
malt
wheat
honey
and
pears
on
the
palate
this
one
has
a
very
nice
fullflavored
sweetness
with
a
light
touch
of
hops
along
with
toffee
butterscotch
and
a
very
nice
alocohol
heat
a
very
sweet
beer
thick
and
rich
but
pleasant
to
drink
another
very
good
effort
from
marin
beer
is
full
bodied
and
it
is
sweet
but
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
it
is
thick
and
there
isnt
much
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
its
all
pretty
good
bitterness
is
low
im
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
again
but
its
pretty
balanced
and
not
cloying
at
all
pretty
good
for
a
wheat
wine
poured
a
deep
golden
and
cloudy
yellow
good
carbonation
and
a
small
white
head
nose
is
wheat
malt

to
appealing
taste
is
sweet
malty
wheat
and
sordove
bland
it
mouthfeel
is
ok
a

syrupy

wheat
but
i
did
not
find
it
impressive
nor
very
drinkable

the

here
that

but
i
can
tell
you
that
i
keep
getting
more
every
time
i
smell
this

its
pretty
damn
good
there
are
all
of
the
characteristics
on
the

that
were
discovered
on
the
nose
with
an
amazingly
creamy

a
bit
of

on

pretty
notable
to
the
tongue
full

and
mildly
carbonated
i
get
some
fruit
nougat
and
buttery

very
tasty
but
a
bit
intense
not
a
session
brew
quite
unique
very
recommendable
rather
sweet
and
raw
tasting
my
first
example
of
the
style
but
if
this
is
indicative
i
would
recommend
sticking
to
barleywine
pours
clear
copper
with
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
rich
maltiness
a
moderate
hint
of
wheat
and
additional
malt
notes
after
a
few
more
draws
i
started
to
notice
mild
dark
fruity
esters
and
some
alcohol
heat
the
taste
has
a
syrupy
sweet
start
as
it
should
with
some
mild
pine
hops
followed
by
sweet
malts
some
wheated
malts
and
persistent
sweet
maltiness
nice
tasting
brew
with
a
pleasing
load
of
malts
and
not
much
on
the
hop
side
of
things
drinkability
very
nice
this
is
a
great
wheatwine
probably
the
best
ive
had
to
date
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
which
is
something
i
dont
often
say
when
talking
about
this
style
very
drinkable
despite
the
relatively
hefty
abv
nice
character
and
balance
with
a
medium
to
mediumheavy
body
very
assertive
flavors
creamed
coffee
and
carmel
in
the
longer
finish
nice
perhaps
drinks
a
bit
sweet
for
some
but
tastes
of
quality
and
character
nonetheless
i
almost
see
this
as
more
of
a
dessert
beer
than
a
food
beer
highly
recommend
this
beer
easily
my
favorite
that
the
guysgals
at
marin
have
put
together
overall
an
extremely
awesome
beer
from
a
quality
brewing
company
who
has
been
in
the
game
for
a
long
time
drinkability
is
ok
my
second
wheatwine
drastically
different
then
the
smutty
which
to
me
was
really
no
different
then
a
barelywine
this
one
is
like
bw
mixed
with
lemon
juice
but
not
in
a
nice
and
funky
lambic
way
might
age
well
but
not
digging
it
now
although
it
certainly
is
unique
in
short
this
was
a
great
beer
i
had
no
expectations
but
i
really
loved
this
beer
great
flavors
and
highly
enjoyable
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
very
balanced
subdued
hops
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
lacking
much
complexity
though
looking
forward
to
a
visit
to
this
brewery
at
this
years
aha
conference
in
june
easily
drinkable
because
its
not
heavy
but
the
flavor
didnt
impress
me
at
all
my
girlfriend
actually
liked
this
brew
better
than
i
did
so
after
drinking
what
i
could
i
gave
her
the
remains
of
my
half
drinkability
it
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
and
i
can
feel
it
but
that
wont
stop
me
from
finishing
the
whole
bomber
drinkability
im
going
to
buy
more
of
this
iso
wheatwines
half
kidding
i
need
to
give
up
trading
for
a
bit
i
could
easily
imagine
myself
drinking
this
until
i
passed
out
sweetness
and
bitterness
battle
back
and
forth
throughout
the
sesh
neither
one
giving
up
any
ground
great
balance
this
totally
exceeded
expectations
which
were
high
anyway
d
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
it
is
a
great
brew
to
share
with
a
couple
of
people
hooray
after
having
those
two
ridgeways
it
was
a
relief
to
drink
this

wheatwine
isnt
a
typical
session
beer
but
the
balance
between
sweet
bitter
and
alcohol
keeps
me
coming
back
to
my
glass
a
beer
i
would
be
interested
in
revisiting
in
the
future
d
eh
its
a
good
beer
according
to
style
but
my
personal
taste
says
that
its
not
something
i
really
care
for
but
overall
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
bad
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
notes
great
stuff
here
expertly
balanced
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
style
at
less
than
5
for
a
22
oz
bottle
its
hard
to
go
wrong
here
d
the
only
wheatwine
ive
had
this
is
the
2nd
time
ive
had
this
marin
brew
a
tasty
beer
definitely
a
barleywine
with
a
wheat
perspective
quite
good
in
its
style
extremely
bready
and
alcoholic
its
my
first
wheatwine
so
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
reminded
me
of
a
drier
eisbock
so
it
wasnt
totally
different
from
beer
ive
had
before
d
easy
to
drink
but
might
get
a
little
cloying
as
the
night
goes
on
drinkability
quite
fruity
and
quite
good
sure
id
have
another
drinkability
is
great
really
enjoying
this

rich

goodness
some
hints
of
butter
and
cashews
taste
is
glorious
fullbodied
with
a
big
hoppy
kick
as
this
is
the
first
wheatwine
ive
tried
i
dont
know
how
it
compares
to
others
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
barleywine
or
a
strong
american
ale
definitely
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
not
too
much
this
is
my
first
wheat
wine
and
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
trying
another
after
review
i
didnt
notice
that
this
was
10
it
drinks
incredibly
smooth
for
a
ten
percent
beer
amazing
the
aroma
of
this
brew
was
pretty
drab
and
i
wish
that
the
ample
hop
character
from
the
flavor
had
shown
up
some
in
the
nose
an
enjoyable
brew
i
want
to
say
that
this
is
overly
simplistic
but
that
is
what
a
wheatwine
is
clean
wheat
and
malt
flavors
with
a
varying
level
of
hop
character
still
this
is
definitely
lacking
something
it
needs
a
bit
more
character
before
i
could
really
really
enjoy
it
d
you
definitely
get
a
fortified
feel
from
this
beer
and
the
10abv
is
wellmasked
but
not
surprising
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
really
like
this
super
wheat
ale
and
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future
for
a
postdinnercold
eveningbarleywineesque
situation
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
marins
selection
but
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
go
try
more
of
their
lineup
a
truly
unique
and
complex
ale
that
breaks
all
the
molds
for
this
style
2006
version
poured
golden
with
a
thin
head
and
okay
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
fresh
wheat
banana
and
wax
tast
is
similar
more
fresh
wheat
somewhat
grainy
banana
citrusy
hops
waxy
fruit
maybe
cherry
or
apple
the
mouthfeeel
is
substantial
slightly
slick
but
creamy
you
dot
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
even
though
it
is
quite
high
in
abv
this
one
is
quite
big
for
a
wheat
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
id
like
to
try
it
fresher
and
see
if
its
even
bolder
and
spicier
this
is
only
my
fifth
wheat
wine
but
star
brew
triple
wheat
ale
is
the
best
that
ive
had
so
far
its
a
remarkable
achievement
that
newcomers
to
the
style
owe
it
to
themselves
to
try
dont
be
surprised
if
it
becomes
your
new
gold
standard
one
delicious
bomber
and
counting
tells
me
that
its
mine
this
one
looked
good
right
off
the
pour
bright
gold
with
a
light
haze
a
tight
white
head
good
retention
and
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
citrusy
hops
on
the
orange
side
but
as
it
warmed
the
malt
came
through
with
hints
of
wheat
bready
crust
and
cereal
grains
it
had
a
solid
bitterness
citrusy
hop
flavour
some
toasted
cereal
fruit
and
a
spicy
alcohol
finish
the
aftertaste
brought
forward
a
piney
character
that
wasnt
apparent
until
that
point
the
carbonation
was
very
fine
and
quite
creamy
lower
than
expected
full
bodied
with
a
pleasing
texture
a
bit
of
stickiness
and
mild
warmth
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
easy
drinking
and
quite
mellow
for
a
big
boy
id
like
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
for
the
cellar
so
id
never
be
without
a
high
quality
wheat
wine
highly
recommended
a
unique
style
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
some
more
examples
of
and
to
think
i
was
wary
of
trying
this
one
again
pours
yellowy
gold
and
very
clear
with
a
small
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
is
soft
honey
sweetness
hints
of
prunes
and
ripe
fruit
hints
of
sweet
citrus
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
also
fruity
some
very
subtle
citrus
with
a
nice
nutty
wheatiness
that
develops
mid
taste
and
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
medium
to
heavy
in
body
decent
bitterness
and
a
good
sized
drying
mixes
with
a
slightly
sweet
and
cloying
finish
alcohol
is
very
well
balanced
but
evident
in
the
taste
an
easy
to
sip
beer
very
subtle
aroma
and
taste
wise
nothing
reaches
out
and
grabs
you
the
wheat
presence
is
most
evident
in
the
taste
and
is
quite
nice
drinkability
more
hoppy
but
as
strong
as
i
am
used
to
very
good
thanks
zorro
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
overall
with
some
white
grape
and
melon
mixing
with
a
dash
of
honey
and
then
rolls
to
a
bit
of
booziness
not
really
hot
but
more
wine
like
finishes
with
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
a
sipping
beer
in
my
opinion
thanks

an
interesting
and
enjoyable
sipping
brew
definitely

trying

this
beer
would
be
good
with

and

at

try
others

is
a

could
see
using
this
to
quench
myself
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
or
to
warm
up
on
a
cold

night
a

to
love
the

insert

triple
wheat
ale
and
always
pick
up
a
couple
of
bottles
each
year
an
annual
favorite
that
despite
its
reported
lower
abv
from
last
year
is
still
a
damned
fine
and
tasty
brew
well
worth
seeking
out
i
just
wish
theyd
bring
back
the
screen

oh
yeah

i
might
not
notice

so
much
i
definitely
feel
its
effects

just
beautiful
although
the
high

makes
it
a
tricky
proposition

this
is
a
highly
enjoyable

it

is
good
happy
big
beering
overall
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
so
i
really
had
quite
a
treat
never
having
had
a
wheat
wine
i
cant
compare
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
i
can
say
that
i
will
be
trying
more
within
this
style
when
i
get
the
chace
really
a
delicious
brew
that
is
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
from
a
great
norcal
brewery
ive
only
had
a
few
wheat
wines
in
my
day
but
this
one
was
at
the
top
notes
this
beer
definitely
does
not
taste
like
it
could
be
10
the
fruitiness
is
pleasant
but
maybe
a
little
over
the
top
and
i
wish
it
finished
a
tiny
bit
dryer
but
overall
it
was
nice
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
because
of
its
sweetness
its
not
an
everyday
beer
or
even
close
to
any
kind
of
session
beer
probably
a
really
good
beer
to
have
every
once
and
a
while
though
went
particularly
well
with
my
homemade
spicy
basil
beef
and
vegatable
samosas
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
left
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
i
am
not
a
giant
fan
of
the
brew
but
it
is
good
if
you
want
to
pack
a
little
bit
of
punch
into
your
day
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
in
the
brew
i
would
get
it
again
and
i
have
had
it
more
than
once
already
d
it
is
definitely
drinkable
though
if
not
for
the
high
alcohol
content
i
would
not
likely
waste
my
time
on
it
it
is
a
good
beer
to
get
your
grilfriend
started
on
appreciating
stronger
beers
though
very
hazy
light
copper
color
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
that
receded
quickly
into
the
glass
the
nose
has
some
bubblegum
a
little
touch
of
biscuit
backed
by
a
lemony
citrus
character
the
taste
has
a
quick
punch
of
bubblegum
followed
very
quickly
by
herbal
hop
and
mild
citrus
hard
candy
character
on
the
finish
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
mildly
sticky
mouth
feel
ok
drinkability
interesting
beer
but
im
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
hazy
tangerine
juice
in
color
assuming
tangerine
juice
is
made
large
creamy
white
head
with
good
density
for
such
a
big
beer
smells
of
apricots
and
papayas
soaked
in
diluted
vodka
taste
is
fruitfilled
strongly
alcoholic
with
notes
of
banana
peels
and
honey
covered
apricots
not
very
good
cloying
malt
liquorish
flavor
is
not
as
strikingly
complex
yet
yields
more
and
more
nuances
as
it
warms
mild
sherry
comes
through
and
the
hops
bite
more
and
more
as
it
sits
which
better
balances
the
esters
and
yes
the
booze
its
like
an
impatient
kid
playing
hideandseek
he
hides
well
but
after
you
let
him
sit
long
enough
he
starts
looking
for
you
spices
interplay
well
with
the
serious
wheat
bill
this
brew
is
packing
all
making
for
a
very
enjoyable
experience
carbonation
is
light
this
pups
delicious
more
and
more
impressed
with
this
brewery
and
moylans
every
time
i
try
a
new
one
big
ups
to
redwoodgeorge
for
sending
this
gem
east
ehhh
no
thanks
drinkability
very
interesting
and
a
new
style
for
me
the
alcohol
presence
makes
this
one
a
bit
heavy
handed
still
this
is
well
crafted
and
immensely
enjoyable
i
can
really
see
getting
into
this
style
strongly
recommended
one
of
the
better
products
from
marin
the
balance
is
allright
from
start
to
finish
and
the
bottle
states
9
7
this
beer
is
a
classic
example
of
temperature
making
all
the
difference
there
was
nothing
especially
outstanding
about
the
nose
or
look
on
the
pour
it
was
golden
clear
with
subtle
hop
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
tasting
it
cold
there
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
as
it
warmed
it
was
crisp
clean
and
boozy
with
some
vanilla
in
the
aftertaste
the
malts
and
alcohol
dominate

i
hate
to
say
like
a
malt
liquor
but
this
is
what
it
reminded
me
of
a
rare
beer
style
that
should
be
experienced
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
a
good
buzz
for
trying
2002
vintage
bottle
with
the
number
2280
in
big
numbers
in
the
middle
of
the
label
this
beer
poured
with
a
very
interesting
look
to
it
the
color
was
pinkish
orange
with
a
thin
swirling
head
on
top
the
pink
color
in
it
was
like
something
youd
see
in
pink
lemonade
or
grapefruit
juice
very
good
looking
beer
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
wheaty
and
bready
wit
ha
touch
of
burned
sugar
sweetness
the
flavor
comes
on
strong
like
a
barleywine
it
has
a
sweet
syrupy
flavor
with
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
and
tangy
caramel
notes
in
the
middle
if
there
were
such
a
thing
as
a
wheatbarley
wine
this
would
be
it
2003
vintage
2450
from
a
22oz
bomber
the
initial
pour
delivers
a
surprisingly
clear
deep
golden
body
with
the
exception
that
particulate
can
clearly
be
seen
rising
and
falling
amidst
its
turbulent
effervescent
carbonation
a
second
pour
however
changes
all
that
and
it
takes
on
the
haze
normally
associated
with
the
style
the
foamy
brightwhite
head
holds
exceptionally
well
and
leaves
solid
sheets
of
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
fruity
with
a
touch
of
pepper
citrusy
with
hops
and
backed
by
a
wheatish
malt
the
body
is
mediumfull
or
is
it
fullmedium
and
the
natural
effervescent
carbonation
bristles
on
the
tongue
its
flavor
is
bold
and
rich
with
a
slap
of
lightlytart
fruit
and
yeast
at
the
outset
followed
by
a
luxurious
wheatbased
maltiness
a
peppery
spiciness
appears
towards
the
swallow
and
it
finishes
dry
but
with
a
note
of
sweet
sugarcookiedoughlike
malt
that
lingers
amidst
a
gentle
spiciness
from
the
alcohol
its
an
impressive
brew
yet
it
may
be
slightly
overdone
as
the
alcohol
becomes
obvious
even
within
a
twelve
ounce
serving
cutting
down
on
its
drinkability
still
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
while
relaxing
in
the
backyard
on
a
cool
summer
evening
as
the
sun
sets
recommended
star
brew
triple
wheat
ale
had
me
thinking
of
a
barleywine
minus
the
hops
or
a
bruising
doppelbock
tasty
but
one
would
do
for
a
night
a
real
sipping
brew
this
one
it
is
like
a
pan
galactic
gargle
blaster
having
you
brains
smashed
in
by
a
gold
brick
wrapped
in
velvet
tasty
stuff
that
will
surprise
you
with
its
kick
man
i
cant
believe
how
drinkable
this
stuff
is
problem
is
after
a
22
ounce
bottle
or
two
youre
toast
or
at
least
horizontal
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
letting
you
now
this
is
a
serious
beer
good
carbonation
lightens
it
up
a
little
the
superb
balance
of
this
beer
makes
for
great
drinkability
certainly
a
tummy
warmer
but
beware
the

i
must
say
so
much

the
best
beers
ive
tried

somewhat
like

lighter

equally
as

this
is
one
great
brew
and
i
will
have

a

o
i
thought
this
was
fairly
enjoyable
although
the
predominance
of
the
blood
orange
flavor
eliminates
any
illusion
of
complexity
but
its
a
natural
pleasant
flavor
to
find
in
the
beer
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
overall
there
was
some
really
nice
fruit
flavor
but
it
didnt
really
come
together
on
the
palate
for
me
overall
a
really
interesting
beer
and
incredibly
refreshing
for
such
a
high
level
of
alcohol
based
on
the
flavors
im
going
to
guess
that
this
is
the
2014
releasethe
orange
flavor
is
just
so
fresh
and
juicy
o
just
like
the
description
on
the
bottle
definetly
worth
trying
for
the
uniqueness
final
thought

and
awesome
wow
thank
you
shorts
brewing
and
marcatgsb
they
put
something
in
this
beer
that
they
shouldnt
have
maybe
some
part
of
the
blood
orange
whatever
it
is
it
gives
the
flavor
a
powerful
and
unpleasant
bitterness
i
like
plenty
of
bitter
beers
but
this
is
just
nasty
an
unhesitating
unquestioned
drainpour
oan

good

a

o
as
my
first

i
love
it
im
sure
they
are
not
all
this
citrusy
but
this
was
excellent
i
need
to
convince
dan

make

this

actually
drinks

with
a
little
wheat
and
caramelized
sweetness
damn
is
it
tasty
interesting
brew
and
an
okay
summer
drink
but
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
o
this
was
an
interesting
brew
that
i
was
glad
to
try
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
to
try
again
it
was
packed
with
flavor
but
the
zestiness
and
peppercorn
were
a
little
bit
too
much
in
my
opinion
plus
it
was
fairly
flat
overall
this
is
definitely
something
worth
trying
for
its
uniqueness
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
unless
you
love
blood
oranges
im
glad
i
traded
for
several
of
these
the
first
couple
i
found
a
bit
strange
but
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
this
its
a
great
original
take
on
wheatwines
with
such
potent
blood
orange
flavor
and
it
goes
down
dangerously
easily
for
a
10
brew
highly
recommended
for
any
fellow
wheatwine
fans
because
its
like
no
other
ill
be
trading
for
some
of
this
every
year
decanted
into
a
gigantic
brewing
goblet
it
was
convenient
poured
a
pleasant
honeyamber
color
pristine
clarity
no
head
but
a
wispy
layer
of
bubbles
that
dissipated
to
an
extremely
thin
ringlet
no
lacing
lots
of
orange
in
the
aroma
pith
pulp
rind
you
name
it
spicy
peppercorns
that
came
out
more
as
the
beer
warmed
up
herbal
hops
and
a
bit
of
booziness
taste
was
distinctively
dominated
by
orange
much
like
the
aroma
tangy
toasted
wheat
secondary
notes
of
banana
peel
and
a
ubiquitous
peppercorn
presence
higher
alcohol
was
detectable
but
not
imposing
flavors
melded
very
well
medium
body
low

unusually
good
drinkability
very
nice
the
reveal
shorts
anniversary
ale
a
blood
orange
wheatwine
with
orange
zest
and
green
peppercorns
on
ba
it
says
it
was
aggressively
dryhopped
so
i
got
that
and
a
citrusy
fruit
totally
whiffed
on
the
peppercorns
though
and
the
actual
style
was
a
mystery
but
in
my
defense
a
fruited
hoppy
wheatwine
is
tough
to
pick
out
i
should
have
guessed
shorts
though
great
beer
looks
pretty
polarizing
on
ba
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
thanks
abraxel
o
i
think
i
would
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
without
the
peppercorns
while
they
do
add
interesting
layers
of
flavor
i
think
they
are
also
partly
clashing
with
the
blood
oranges
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
it
was
worth
the
purchase
but
probably
not
one
id
have
again
fuller
medium
body
lighter
carbonation
sticky
and
full
on
the
tongue
i
really
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
one
between
the
oranges
peppercorns
and
warmth
this
was
one
of
the
best
shorts
beers
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
more
please
o
this
is
a
great
beer
from
shorts
the
taste
and
smell
are
awesome
and
i
think
it
is
among
the
best
of
shorts
line
of
eccentric
brews
very
good
and
definitely
worth
a
try
for
sure
wow
again
the
flavors
from
the
oranges
are
big
and
bad
grapefruit
and
orange
dominate
the
palate
with
undertones
of
cereal
wheat
and
honey
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
my
favorite
beer
from
shorts
without
a
doubt
unique
thirst
quenching
vibrant
is
this
really
ten
percent
i
found
this
beer
enjoyable
but
would
probably
not
seek
it
out
again
this
just
isnt
quite
my
style
its
not
bad
by
any
means
though
in
fact
id
consider
it
to
be
a
very
good
beer
just
because
i
never
thought
peppery
sour
orange
juice
brine
would
be
an
appealing
flavor
definitely
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
its
a
unique
beer
but
id
not
have
it
often
overall
i
picked
up
the
last
one
of
these
at
the
store
when
i
had
thought
i
missed
it
and
am
i
glad
i
did
this
is
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
coulda
got
a
whole
sixpack
the
tastes
are
spot
just
delicous
will
buy
this
one
year
after
year
enjoyed
a
2013
anniversary
ale
fresh
the
blood
oranges
are
a
little
more
vibrant
and
assertive
and
the
peppercorn
is
toned
down
just
a
touch
but
it
still
an
integral
part
of
the
brew
hop
character
is
also
a
bit
more
prominent
mouth
feel
is
better
than
i
remember
and
the
juicy
sweet
and
nearly
tart
blood

finish
is
fantastic
dont
know
if
this
is
better
fresh
or
the
2013
batch
was
just
a
little
more
to
my
liking
but
ive
gotta
bump
the
score
this
is
great

and
very
smooth

on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
this
is
my
first
shorts
brewing
beer
and
anniversary
ale
is
one
of
the
most
unique
ales
i
have
hadi
guess
i
am
still
trying
to
figure
this
one
out
i
plan
to
age
a
few
of
these
to
see
how
age
affects
this
unique
brew
whew
blood
oranges
you
get
subtle
hints
of
it
on
the
nose
but
there
is
nothing
subtle
about
the
blood
oranges
on
the
flavor
profile
the
bitter
tones
that
taste
like
they
are
from
the
oranges
skin
are
too
prevalent
beyond
that
there
is
little
that
you
get
a
ride
from
as
a
wheatwine
this
falls
short
as
a
beer
its
alright
quite
the
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
still
have
one
left
the
only
question
is
when
a
nice
change
the
blood
oranges
really
come
through
the
peppercorn
provides
a
nice
bonus
o
i
actually
really
like
this
beer
honestly
its
like
biting
into
an
orange
picked
straight
off
the
tree
rind
and
all
overall
real
impressive
its
like
eating
grapefruit
rinds
and
all
its
bitter
softness
in
a
liquid
form
with
a
chewy
backbone
neat
delicious
grapefruit
and
orange
flavors
on
the
palate
spicy
peppery
herbal
some
earthy
notes
mid
palate
finishes
quite
bitter
and
herbal
dry
and
light
bodied
delicious
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
i
guess
i
havent
had
anything
else
to
compare
this
against
i
will
be
seeking
other
wheatwines
and
compare
i
also
may
be
very
partial
here
because
i
love
the
taste
of
blood
orange
if
you
like
blood
orange
and
dont
mind
the
alcohol
heat
this
is
your
beer
cheers
o
i
cant
remember
ever
having
a
beer
like
this
one
before
which
is
why
i
pick
it
up
each
year
it
is
a
unique
flavor
pairing
and
it
really
challenges
the
tastebuds
like
many
of
the
shorts
brews
this
is
probably
not
for
everyone
though
i
enjoy
it
i
do
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
but
there
really
isnt
anything
quite
like
it
o
pretty
enjoyable
wheatwine
and
i
enjoyed
the
citrus
and
pepper
components
a
unique
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
well
worth
a
try
672011
o
this
brew
optimizes
what
i
love
about
shorts
very
unique
brew
yum
nice
sweetness
very
refreshing
highly
recommended
unique
brew
very
sweet
but
in
a
good
way
o
extremely
well
rounded
and
great
tasting
definitely
one
that
i
would
pick
a
bunch
of
and
perhaps
age
if
it
ages
well
o
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
only
spent
a
few
months
in
michigan
but
shorts
is
definitely
one
of
the
breweries
that
i
will
truly
miss
theres
no
doubt
this
is
crisp
and
a
medium
body
shows
some
depth
to
it
with
a
good
smoothness
that
a
little
more
of
would
serve
to
put
this
one
a
step
above
it
goes
slightly
slick
in
the
mouthfeel
toward
the
finish
d
im
on
the
verge
of
liking
this
probably
the
hoppiest
bw
or
ww
that
ive
had
and
enjoyed
the
citrus
hop
character
really
helps
to
accentuate
the
citrus
in
the
beer
it
just
idk
it
doesnt
quite
hit
me
like
i
want
it
to
but
a
good
beer
overall
mouthfeel
drinkable
medium
to
thick
bodied
curious
how
this
would
age
good
carbonation
for
the
body
o
exceeded
my
expectations
to
the
point
where
i
am
iso
another
bottle
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
ipalike
qualities
this
had
to
offer
send
me
another
bottle
jay
d
certainly
very
flavorful
but
the
question
is
how
that
flavor
appeals
to
the
individual
goes
down
slowly
because
of
the
strange
flavor
and
the
high
abv
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
odd
representation
of
style
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
strangest
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
over
6
years
and
2500
reviews
this
is
definitely
a
novelty
beer
but
it
has
a
taste
that
can
grow
on
you
if
you
have
an
affinity
for
that
kind
bloody
mary
flavor
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
a
good
break
from
the
ipas
dipas
and
stouts
i
have
been
enjoying
lately
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
really
hitting
the
spot

but
i
do

make
an

different

exciting
i
just

this
is
not

or
not
i
give

about

ale
heres
to
another
great
year
of

big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
orange
sugar
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
orange
sugar
and
syrup
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
im
starting
to
wonder
if
wheat
wines
are
just
not
for
me
or
something
the
idea
is
nice
but
usually
the
execution
is
off
for
my
palate
the
sweetness
from
the
sugar
on
this
one
really
killed
it
for
me
unfortunately
worth
trying
for
a
fan
of
the
style
but
if
you
have
never
had
one
before
i
suggest
starting
elsewhere
deep
orange
color
in

very
sexy
color
head
is
absent
managed
to
force
a
few
bubbles
with
a
heavy
pour
but
they
run
and
hide
the
carbonation
is
present
in
the
mouth
however
aromas
of
sweet
candied
oranges
smells
sticky
flavor
has
god
intensity
orange
is
nicely
squeezed
in
the
midpalate
with
a
wheaty
finish
a
good
bit
of
heat
fro
mthe
booze
matches
up
nicely
with
the
mellow
rich
body
to
this
beer
very
solid
brew
my
favorite
of
the
shorts
ive
tried
o
the
beer
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
it
has
some
good
flavors
and
is
pretty
well
crafted
o
this
was
really
cool
and
unusual
to
try
certainly
not
something
id
wanna
drink
everyday
but
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thank
you
northernbrews
d
i
love
a
shorts
beer
and
this
is
mos
definitely
that
totally
out
there
i
love
this
beer
totally
different
take
on
the
style
drink
i
really
wanted
this
to
blow
me
away
and
i
was
just
wrong
direction
i
didnt
like
the
taste
at
all
i
am
sure
this
is
for
some
people
but
just
not
me
overall
its
a
very
interesting
brew
that
id
like
to
retry
ever
now
and
again
just
because
its
so
interesting
tasty
too
this
is
my
first
wheatwine
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
seasonal
beer
as
i
cant
imagine
drinking
a
lot
of
it
but
will
look
for
it
again
when
im
back
in
michigan
next
year
o
one
of
the
best
wheatwines
i
have
had
so
far
the
blood
oranges
gave
it
a
nice
flavor
and
made
it
much
more
drinkable
probably
does
not
seem
like
a
10
beer
whatsoever
o
i
have
1additional
bottle
of
this
that
i
brought
back
with
me
and
i
am
curious
to
see
how
this
evolves
in
the
bottle
i
shouldve
really
popped
this
2months
ago
when
i
first
got
home
to
get
a
better
idea
of
it
while
fresh
compared
to
the
bottle
im
cellaring
certainly
interesting
for
the
style
i
think
im
just
not
personally
a
huge
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
but
was
curious
to
try
it
i
honestly
had
no
preconceived
notions
of
what
to
expect
here
the
cpj
o
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
i
got
this
down
pretty
easily
overall
a
fantastic
achievement
in
the
art
and
practice
of
brewing
wheat
wine
can
be
great
or
not
so
and
this
one
was
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
captures
the
flavor
of
the
blood
orange
and
the
essence
of
a
wheat
wine
in
perfect
harmony
this
beer
pours
a
bright
reddish
copper
in
color
with
a
light
off
white
lacing
it
hits
blood
orange
in
color
on
the
head
it
smells
or
orange
peels
with
light
sweet
caramel
malts
its
pretty
appealing
on
the
nose
it
tastes
of
grated
orange
peels
thatve
assaulted
your
palate
with
an
aerial
assault
its
very
spicy
and
doesnt
present
any
alcohol
at
all
it
maskes
the
generic
overly
sweet
malt
of
the
style
and
is
overly
fruity
it
drinks
well
and
is
pretty
light
in
body
it
features
a
lot
of
malt
but
doesnt
drink
in
an
overly
sticky
manner
the
alcohol
isnt
present
whatsoever
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
wheatwines
ive
had
the
fruit
did
this
one
some
favors
id
recommend
it
o
a
decent
beer
a
bit
odd
at
times
but
the
flavor
combination
seems
to
work
quite
well
much
more
so
than
in
shorts
other
beers
slight
bitter
and
slightly
sweet
o
this
is
a
great
wheat
wine
and
the
orange
zest
is
an
incredible
flavor
in
this
blends
well
in
the
style
and
ill
be
trying
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
o
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
the
blood
orange
flavors
are
right
up
front
and
not
subtle
at
all
but
its
still
very
tasty
i
only
bought
1
bottle
but
id
probably
have
another
curious
what
a
year
or
2
would
do
for
it
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
which
im
glad
to
have
had
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
appreciate
the
effort
from
shorts
not
too
many
beers
out
there
made
with
oranges
that
work
very
well
but
this
one
is
on
the
right
track
o
this
brew
is
interesting
and
like
all
shorts
beers
its
incredibly
unique
the
resulting
product
is
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
finally
gonna
crack
into
this
tastysounding
wheatwine
it
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
blood
orange
zest
tart
orange
nutmeg
maple
syrup
and
light
black
pepper
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
mandarin
orange
syrup
light
green
peppers
banana
light
vanilla
bean
ruby
red
grapefruit
and
some
very
light
leek
somehow
this
thing
tastes
both
all
over
the
place
and
citruscentric
at
the
same
time
nice
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
syrupy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
wheatwine
one
that
shows
what
strategic
use
of
blood
oranges
can
do
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
pours
a
lovely
deep
burnt
red
hue
with
a
quarter
inch
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
frothy
band
nose
is
sweet
and
clearly
expresses
blood
orange
and
citric
acid
as
well
as
an
herbalspicy
quality
its
really
quite
interesting
and
like
nothing
ive
ever
smelled
before
in
a
beer
taste
expresses
a
great
deal
of
citrus
rind
as
well
as
a
trace
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
quite
a
bit
of
astringency
an
interesting
beer
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
however
a
half
pour
was
more
than
sufficient
overall
its
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
i
can
respect
what
shorts
was
trying
to
do
it
may
not
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
its
one
of
the
most
memorable
ive
had
from
them
12oz

many
thanks
kevin
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangemahogany
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
carbonation
is
quite
active
aroma
had
loads
of
sweet
orange
pith
wheat
caramel
and
light
pepper
taste
is
sweet
with
the
orange
really
coming
through
the
peppercorns
are
noticeable
but
only
appear
at
times
this
one
is
definitely
more
about
the
orange
full
bodied
with
a
sticky
texture
a
nice
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
maroon
slight
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
juicy
orange
sugary
cherry
floral
grassy
macadamia
nut
with
a
spicy
and
peppery
undertone
theres
a
lot
of
really
interesting
stuff
going
on
here
all
nicely
integrating
and
nothing
dominating
i
like
the
contrast
between
spicy
and
sweet
the
taste
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
great
aroma
in
terms
of
breadth
and
balance
of
flavor
with
the
pepper
coming
through
moreperhaps
for
the
worse
also
present
in
the
taste
is
a
bitter
red
grapefruit
this
is
pretty
dry
carbonation
and
body
are
both
medium
no
heat
to
speak
of
overall
this
has
a
really
interesting
nose
but
the
flavor
comes
up
lacking
and
i
didnt
find
myself
wanting
another
one
after
finishing
o
i
sipped
on
this
for
awhile
and
im
still
a
little
baffled
it
isnt
like
anything
ive
had
to
date
oddly
enough
its
almost
like
a
flanders
mixed
with
a
saison
2011
bottle
poured
into
snifter
on
05122011
this
beer
immediately
lives
up
to
its
name
blood
orangered
body
topped
by
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lace
the
nose
is
met
with
orange
strong
citrus
and
a
touch
of
honey
for
an
attempt
to
balance
the
taste
follows
though
lots
of
blood
orange
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
medium
body
lightmedium
carbonation
good
and
interesting
brew
one
or
two
is
enough
d
one
of
the
better
wheatwines
ive
had
and
one
of
the
strongest
shorts
offerings
ive
had
in
recent
memory
the
flavor
combination
worked
for
me
and
the
10
abv
was
pretty
unobtrusive
id
have
this
one
again
for
sure
the
beer
is
ruby
hued
and
transparent
with
14
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
primarily
of
hops
with
a
present
alcohol
sweetness
the
flavor
starts
out
well
with
hops
in
the
driver
seat
masking
the
alcohol
for
the
most
part
unfortunately
the
finish
brings
an
oddness
and
harshness
that
negatively
impacts
my
enjoyment
to
a
great
degree
the
sweetness
mounts
rapidly
and
i
could
see
this
beer
becoming
cloying
quickly
a
couple
of
ounces
was
more
than
enough
for
me
pours
a
ruby
redish
blood
organish
color
with
very
little
head
and
a
slight
amount
of
hops
the
aroma
is
of
big
orange
and
some
other
citrus
notes
along
with
a
hint
of
peppercorn
and
some
breadiness
the
taste
has
a
breadiness
backbone
with
hints
of
pepper
but
the
real
star
is
the
big
orange
and
grapefruit
flavors
a
nice
sweet
inviting
taste
there
is
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
to
bring
in
some
balance
there
is
no
hint
of
booze
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
aroma
draws
you
in
and
the
taste
left
me
wanting
more
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
beer
is
sweet
and
quite
hoppy
thin
up
front
with
a
moderately
dry
finish
the
overall
beer
is
quite
good
too
as
the
beer
warms
unfortunately
it
takes
on
this
medicinal
sweetness
and
harsh
finish
with
a
really
bad
aftertaste
of
grainy
acidity
and
a
little
sulfur
i
dont
know
what
the
deal
with
this
beer
is
but
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
it
in
the
beginning
i
really
liked
it
but
it
was
all
downhill
from
there
thanks
again
jim
o
wow
color
me
impressed
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
wheat
wines
seek
this
one
out
it
was
a
great
experience
to
drink
on
a
multitude
of
levels
appearance
aroma
taste
all
pushing
the
boundaries
and
working
synergistically
to
create
an
amazing
drinking
experience
well
done
shorts
keep
this
adventurous
spirit
alive
and
screw
the
mainstream
i
really
enjoyed
this
there
now
way
a
beer
this
big
should
go
down
so
easy
in
warm
weather
could
drink
this
all
springsummer
if
feasible
o
this
is
a
great
wheat
wine
and
i
would
feel
less
concerned
with
using
this
blood
oranges
in
a
homebrew
i
would
not
even
think
that
this
beer
would
be
at
11
7
abv
at
all
nice
job
this
is
not
a
subtle
beer
it
is
intense
and
in
your
face
but
still
enjoyable
if
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
hv
overall
a
very
nice
effort
makes
a
nice
nightcap
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
o
i
think
the
year
in
the
cellar
has
helped
this
beer
out
bringing
its
various
elements
into
balance
an
aboveaverage
wheatwine
d
not
someting
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
especially
with
the
11
7
abv
totally
masked
would
make
a
nice
digestif
w
pastry
or
even
fresh
fruit
overall
hey
it
wasnt
infected
the
blood
orange
is
quite
tasty
but
to
be
honest
this
isnt
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
a
unique
beer
with
an
awesome
aroma
that
was
a
pleasure
to
try
overall
i
though
this
was
one
excellent
beer
for
this
warm
mid
michigan
night
i
dont
think
i
could
have
picked
a
better
beer
to
me
everything
about
this
beer
screams
warm
weather
the
citrus
flavors
were
bold
and
in
your
face
and
i
thought
that
was
really
good
and
unique
the
blood
orange
was
the
most
prevalent
of
the
citrus
fruits
like
the
description
on
the
bottle
implies
the
peppercorns
were
much
more
subtle
and
harder
to
pick
out
but
they
did
add
to
the
complexity
of
this
beer
the
only
other
wheatwine
i
have
had
was
pilgrims
dole
from
new
holland
its
hard
to
compare
the
two
since
pilgrims
dole
seemed
to
be
much
straight
forward
and
truer
to
the
style
while
on
this
beer
shorts
seems
to
use
the
wheatwine
as
a
backbone
to
hold
tons
of
hoppy
and
citrus
fruit
flavors
normally
associated
with
dipas
i
expect
shorts
to
try
something
with
a
style
nobody
has
tried
before
and
this
seems
to
go
along
with
that
just
like
it
should
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
awesome
it
went
down
really
smooth
and
there
was
no
way
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
almost
12
which
could
make
it
pretty
devastating
after
two
or
three
i
only
bought
one
bottle
but
i
am
making
sure
to
grab
a
six
pack
before
they
are
all
gone
so
i
can
have
some
during
the
summer
i
think
everybody
should
give
this
beer
a
try
its
just
that
good
this
was
one
kick
ass
brew
from
shorts
i
love
all
the
crazy
shit
you
guys
do
to
your
brews
keep
it
up
drink
and
overall
the
shorts
legend
continues
to
grow
fantastic
wheat
wine
that
shines
with
the
addition
of
peppercorns
and
blood
oranges
id
say
this
is
a
hit
rather
than
a
miss
a
beer
for
savoring
growler
thanks
to
stfun
on
ratebeer
clear
but
very
dark
orangered
pour
light
lasting
lacing
and
an
aroma
of
sweet
blood
oranges
and
a
little
caramel
flavor
is
incredibly
unique
toffee
floral
bittersweet
blood
oranges
then
jumps
into
bitter
grapefruit
pineapple
and
finished
with
a
warming
and
just
slightly
boozy
aftertaste
very
good
i
might
need
to
go
chasing
after
a
few
bottles
of
this
o
as
usual
with
shorts
beers
this
is
interesting
and
a
bit
unique
i
liked
it
but
not
sure
i
need
a
lot
of
this
we
shared
a
bottle
three
ways
and
it
seemed
about
right
good
in
small
quanities
but
not
sure
that
a
full
bottle
is
necessary
d
fairly
drinkable
if
youre
into
it
shorts
beers
seem
to
be
hit
or
miss
and
this
is
a
miss
to
me
certainly
an
interesting
flavor
experience
but
not
a
beer
that
id
want
to
have
again
d
if
this
werent
utterly
through
the
roof
in
terms
of
abv
id
drink
it
forever
i
know
by
the
time
i
get
to
the
end
ill
be
ready
to
move
on
but
i
will
be
refilling
its
space
in
my
cellar
with
more
bottles
highly
recommended
d
unique
beer
good
to
try
one
drinkability
middle
of
the
road
in
terms
of
drinkability
a
bomber
would
be
overwhelming
unique
none
the
less
difficult
to
find
and
a
little
pricey
for
these
beers
but
i
do
enjoy
it
its
a
sipping
beer
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
feel
like
i
could
slam
this
abv
is
definitely
prevalent
a
beer
youd
just
have
one
of
ive
had
this
out
of
a
growler
and
a
bottle
and
both
were
excellent
id
have
it
again
but
doubt
ill
seek
it
out
the
mouthfeel
was
mildly
carbonated
and
medium
in
body
d
not
the
easiest
to
drink
by
any
means
this
one
grew
on
me
a
lot
drinkability
onedimensional
and
strange
i
couldnt
seem
to
find
anything
underneath
the
heavy
grapefruit
and
blood
orange
this
felt
more
like
a
novelty
beer
than
a
celebratory
one
courtesy
of
jdubfl
wow
thanks
justin
growler
poured
out
clear
copper
with
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
iipa
like
with
fresh
rich
citrus
pine
and
grassiness
and
then
a
mild
malt
like
sweetness
the
taste
is
yummy
with
fresh
rich
citrus
flavors
some
pine
hop
bitterness
spicy
rye
notes
some
drying
malt
roastiness
and
a
thin
layer
of
sweet
maltiness
these
notes
all
head
off
into
the
finish
with
the
addition
of
a
pleasing
black
tea
like
sensation
that
brings
the
whole
thing
together
this
beers
is
fresh
rich
citrus
robust
pummeling
hops
and
yet
manages
to
create
a
semblance
of
balance
too
wow
i
need
a
keg
or
two
of
this
the
more
time
i
spend
with
this
beer
the
more
its
lingering
flavors
come
out
and
after
not
having
taken
a
sip
for
several
minutes
i
distinctly
taste
peppercorns
on
the
front
of
my
tongue
i
like
that
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
shorts
beer
overall
a
great
experience
i
dont
see
knocking
down
a
6
pack
on
poker
night
its
the
type
of
beer
you
drink
in
front
of
a
fire
and
think
about
or
drink
some
with
a
citrus
based
dessert
makes
me
kinda
wish
i
had
one
of
those
dumb
chocolate
covered
orange
things
you
get
from
people
at
work
on
christmas
d
this
is
a
sipping
beer
if
ive
ever
had
one
warming
and
potent
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
shorts
anniversary
has
some
wellused
interesting
ingredients
to
make
a
good
wheatwine
drinkability
i
did
a
180
with
this
beer
at
first
i
found
it
unbalanced
and
a
bit
too
herbal
but
as
it
warmed
i
enjoyed
the
subtle
flavorings
and
in
particular
the
peppercorn
heat
on
the
finish
weird
beer
doesnt
seem
to
be
like
most
wheatwines
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
that
great
for
me
the
oranges
were
just
too
overpowering
to
get
much
of
anything
else
out
of
it
it
felt
more
like
an
oj
and
vodka
at
times
i
really
love
the
wheatwine
style
but
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
on
the
positive
side
they
did
really
infuse
a
fresh
orange
taste
into
it
d
this
is
another
very
interesting
unique
brew
by
shorts
brewing
co
the
alcohol
heat
really
comes
through
toward
the
end
of
this
brew
still
enjoyable
and
unique
definitely
worth
trying
weird
for
a
wheatwine
but
quite
enjoyable
i
wont
seek
this
out
but
would
be
up
for
another
some
time
d
interesting
here
and
perhaps
the
best
wheatwine
a
style
i
just
cant
seem
to
figure
out
ive
had
to
date
excellent
use
of
fruit
and
insanely
dangerous
with
nary
any
noticeable
alcohol
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
similar
the
flavor
profile
stayed
to
blood
oranges
the
sweetness
was
more
robust
than
normal
oranges
and
the
citrus
notes
came
through
as
much
as
any
beer
ive
had
previously
very
much
worth
a
shot
dnice
beer
overall
good
job
shorts
d
reading
through
previous
reviews
i
almost
have
to
question
my
taste
it
seems
a
lot
of
what
i
liked
about
this
beer
wasnt
a
big
hit
with
others
im
glad
i
got
this
one
recommended
to
me
though
i
think
i
could
drink
these
until
i
passed
out
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
was
above
6
i
see
how
the
smell
could
be
offputting
to
some
but
if
you
stick
around
its
gold
nectar
of
the
gods
in
a
few
years
time
i
hope
so
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
so
far
from
shorts
but
thats
not
saying
much
i
tried
this
again
after
buying
a
six
pack
three4
weeks
later
it
was
much
less
bitter
much
hotter
and
much
boozier
not
as
great
as
i
remembered
fresh
this
beer
was
amazing
and
now
for
something
completely
different
the
palate
grapefruit
juice
and
rind
is
just
overwhelming
here
this
is
very
very
intense
this
almost
tastes
like
they
tossed
the
blood
oranges
in
whole
rather
than
actually
separate
the
zest
the
rind
and
the
flesh
the
sweetness
of
the
nose
does
not
translate
to
the
palate
it
is
in
fact
quite
low
as
is
the
spice
boozy
on
the
finish
with
a
little
sweetness
with
vanilla
and
candied
oranges
a
light
spice
character
is
present
on
the
finish
full
in
body
with
a
smooth
palate
and
low
carbonation
this
has
great
flavors
but
is
just
a
little
too
intense
to
be
drinkable
and
as
it
warms
up
i
get
a
slightly
stale
flavor
i
find
in
a
few
wheatwines
solid
stuff
like
nothing
else
ive
ever
encountered
interesting
stuff
d
kind
of
a
weird
beer
the
smell
was
ok
but
the
taste
wasnt
very
enjoyable
wouldnt
seek
out
again
it
felt
somewhat
syrupy
with
a
light
bitter
bite
if
it
was
easier
to
come
across
this
i
would
be
worried
about
being
too
drinkable
pours
dark
red
brown
zero
head
despite
an
aggressive
pour
smells
citrusy
very
much
like
fresh
squeezed
orange
juice
the
peppercorns
are
in
the
nose
as
well
however
much
more
subtly
tart
citrusy
taste
from
the
oranges
almost
borders
on
sour
there
is
a
spiciness
from
the
peppercorns
also
some
sweet
caramel
malt
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
syrupy
surprisingly
drinkable
for
how
sweet
and
high
in
alcohol
it
is
a
really
unique
beer
worth
tracking
down
and
keeeping
a
few
in
the
cellar
carbonation
is
fizzy
and
high
though
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
sharpness
would
pair
nice
at
brunch
as
a
complement
to
some
waffles
since
it
has
a
champagne
dryness
similar
to
a
mimosa
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
out
of
the
shorts
camp
their
bizarre
creations
can
be
hit
or
miss
count
this
firmly
in
the
hit
category
i
think
i
might
return
to
the
store
where
i
bought
it
and
pick
up
another
6pack
or
two
heres
to
hoping
they
have
some
left
id
rate
this
as
a
good
beer
the
peppercorns
however
have
really
taken
over
obliterating
most
of
the
orange
wheat
hops
that
might
have
originally
existed
here
nice
twist
happy
to
have
another
10
ounces
to
work
through
a
burn
notice
with
sampled
at
the
great
taste
of
the
mw
the
2010
anniversary
edition
pours
a
truly
awesome
blood
orange
reddish
tan
color
with
a
tan
head
liquid
ruby
comes
to
mind
grapefruit
and
orange
aromas
in
the
nose
very
pleasant
very
sweet
and
malty
start
that
then
turns
slightly
bitter
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
i
hate
to
rush
and
drink
as
it
really
is
very
good
d
fairly
high
style
in
mind
the
alcohol
is
in
check
boozy
but
not
out
of
line
a
refreshing
take
on
a
favorite
style
of
mine
this
is
a
sipper
and
has
some
wonderful
flavors
in
it
who
would
have
thought
that
pepper
and
blood
oranges
would
complement
each
other
so
well
another
creative
and
well
crafted
beer
from
bellaire
mi
d
shorts
just
likes
to
make
beers
that
make
you
think
a
lot
the
flavors
are
very
present
during
the
whole
beer
and
are
in
your
face
shorts
does
well
with
making
beers
you
want
to
drink
over
and
over
again
the
abv
is
high
on
this
which
limits
it
but
only
if
you
want
to
play
it
safe
pours
an
orangish
color
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
immediately
magnetic
to
my
nosethe
peppercorns
and
blood
orange
really
make
a
wonderful
pairing
the
taste
is
another
step
up
from
there
with
the
peppercorns
not
too
pronounced
and
the
blood
oranges
presenting
a
cacophony
of
flavors
all
by
themselves
mouthfeel
is
exception
thought
this
was
about
5
abv
based
on
taste
drinkability
isnt
that
high
although
i
thought
about
boosting
the
score
about
more
as
this
is
so
good
compared
to
other
wheatwines
that
its
drinkability
is
by
definition
good
or
a
bit
higher
had
a
couple
bottles
of
this
one
and
it
did
not
approach
the
greatness
of
the
tap
version
so
i
will
adjust
my
score
accordingly
the
cloudy
pour
and
sour
orange
flavor
detract
a
bit
from
what
was
great
about
this
one
on
tap
bottle
poured
into
new
belgium
tulip
pours
a
blood
orange
red
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
smell
is
very
citrusy
with
lots
of
sweetness
and
orange
zest
taste
is
slightly
sour
and
acidic
with
lots
of
bitter
orange
zest
and
antiseptic
in
the
finish
aftertaste
is
not
pleasant
but
other
then
that
this
is
a
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
a
light
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
great
but
i
havent
had
much
different
for
the
style
d
it
does
not
exactly
remind
me
of
a
wheatwine
other
than
the
underlying
sweetness
of
it
bu
it
sure
is
tasty
besides
i
would
put
this
as
a
fruit
beer
instead
in
my
humble
opinion
but
i
am
torn
since
it
really
appeals
to
me
due
to
my
love
of
sours
and
such
a
fun
and
dynamic
beer
though
that
i
am
enjoying
very
much
i
am
just
not
sold
on
the
style
it
is
in
d
you
sip
it
you
drink
one
you
are
over
the
taste
is
so
complex
you
dont
want
anything
before
it
to
muss
up
the
taste
buds
nor
do
you
want
or
need
anything
after
drinkabilitythis
is
an
incredible
and
complex
wheatwine
with
amazing
orange
flavors

hits
the
spot
and
goes
down
easy
a
good
summertime
drink
though
it
wasnt
really
sessionable
with
the
11
7abv
goes
down
very
easy
though
almost
a
standalone
drink
you
dont
need
much
else
after
it
would
maybe
try
a
bit
warmer
next
time
perhaps
after
leaving
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
half
hour
or
so
d
overall
the
alcohol
is
hidden
extraordinarily
well
and
the
sweetness
isnt
too
rich
drinks
far
too
easily
for
the
abv
d
this
another
great
beer
from
shorts
you
can
dell
its
a
great
execution
but
i
think
the
intent
falls
short
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
and
definitely
an
experience
just
not
a
amazing
beer
a
sipper
but
very
enjoyable
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
a
couple
a
couple
would
certainly
be
enough
it
is
unfortunate
this
is
not
a
season
i
would
like
to
have
this
available
on
occasion
this
beer
just
makes
me
shake
my
head
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
besides
its
damn
good
really
good
stuff
that
i
was
glad
to
see
on
hopcats
bottle
list
well
worth
tracking
a
bottle
down
if
you
can
not
quite
the
winner
i
was
expecting
but
super
glad
to
get
to
try
it
pours
a
clean
deep
reddish
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
orange
zest
somewhat
peppery
and
spicy
wheat
notes
in
the
taste
orange
juice
quite
spicy
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
smooth
and
medium
to
big
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
orange
zest
aftertaste
big
orange
presence
almost
difficult
to
finish
due
to
abv
and
citrus
a
blood
orange
wheat
wine
sounded
a
little
crazy
when
i
first
heard
about
this
but
the
flavors
all
just
worked
very
nicely
for
me
here
i
love
that
this
didnt
skip
on
the
orange
flavor
and
the
addition
of
peppercorns
really
upped
the
zestiness
of
this
to
a
new
level
the
finish
was
a
little
overly
bitter
imho
but
otherwise
this
was
pretty
great
stuff
m
i
felt
that
this
was
much
too
thin
and
not
carbonated
enough
this
is
really
the
only
glaring
default
i
found
with
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
oranges
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
blood
oranges
wheat
and
alcohol
there
is
a
little
bit
of
tartness
in
the
flavor
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
get
in
a
sour
ale
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
good
beer
taste
big
juicy
blood
orange
flavor
the
green
peppercorn
are
slightly
offputting
for
me
but
it
is
still
rather
tasty
overall
this
is
gonna
be
a
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
an
i
loved
it
really
worked
very
well
for
me
on
nearly
every
level
3

d
i
like
shorts
for
their
innovative
brews
while
they
had
a
good
idea
here
it
fell
short
due
to
the
lack
of
maltiness
which
is
something
i
rarely
suggest
when
considering
barleywines
still
it
was
worth
the
experience
this
is
ing
fantastic
its
a
dry
wheat
ale
wheat
wine
11
abv
with
a
sweet
blood
orange
flavor
up
front
and
blood
orange
bitterness
in
the
middle
from
zest
it
finishes
with
a
dry
peppery
spike
to
the
tongue
from
green
peppercorns
the
hops
are
centennial
and
just
on
the
nose
quality
brew
this
fellow
bas
is
a
diamond
in
the
rough
if
you
see
this
beer
buy
it
chill
it
let
it
sit
for
20
minutes
or
so
after
pouring
and
enjoy
youll
never
try
another
beer
like
this
again
d
this
is
a
really
large
and
interesting
beer
which
i
have
had
a
couple
of
times
now
but
with
its
aggressive
spiciness
high
a
b
v
and
dry
finish
i
dont
think
this
would
be
a
drink
often
beer
for
me
one
is
plenty
the
aftertaste
doesnt
keep
my
interest
for
more
i
like
that
this
is
original
but
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
overall
shorts
has
fried
my
circuits
once
again
in
a
good
way
very
sweet
and
somewhat
sour
with
lots
of
warm
spices
worming
themselves
through
this
hearty
jovial
beast
as
it
warms
the
clove
finally
spouts
out
the
green
peppercorns
can
be
a
little
heavy
handed
but
dont
really
rock
the
boat
or
i
should
say
battleship
this
is
one
big
burly
ale
with
a
big
smile
on
its
shiny
face
at
least
my
face
is
grinning
with
a
slight
shine
to
it
now
that
my
glass
is
empty
d
my
expectations
were
far
exceeded
by
this
beer
really
is
an
absolute
must
try
in
my
opinion
the
11
7
abv
is
completely
hidden
the
flavor
is
wonderful
its
smooth
dangerously
drinkable
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
during
a
recent
trip
to
michigan
and
debated
whether
or
not
to
buy
it
but
am
so
glad
i
did
overall
this
wheatwine
drinks
like
an
iipa
very
fresh
hops
and
citrus
profile
it
is
very
good
and
drinks
easily
i
will
have
more
of
this
one
im
extremely
pleased
with
this
one
and
i
really
enjoyed
what
the
blood
oranges
bring
to
the
table
big
complex
brew
not
extremely
drinkable
but
quite
a
sipper
d
with
its
sour
slightly
alcoholic
profile
it
drinks
a
lot
like
a
wine
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
d
at
nearly
12
this
wheatwine
is
best
enjoyed
in
short
doses
i
love
the
flavor
the
citrus
and
blood
orange
a
worthy
anniversary
ale
d
its
a
definite
sipper
so
complex
and
fun
that
im
disappointed
that
i
likely
wont
have
a
chance
to
try
it
again
as
its
a
one
off
brew
im
pretty
sure
i
got
the
last
bottle
at
my
local
shop
the
abv
is
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
wanting
to
lock
myself
in
my
room
with
a
sixpack
i
have
to
give
a
shout
out
to
one
of
my
brewsday
buddies
for
giving
me
a
sample
of
this
fine
brew
i
was
pretty
geeked
to
find
my
own
bottle
last
week
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
what
an
interesting
beer
granted
what
was
i
expecting
from
shorts
i
am
very
thankful
i
was
able
to
try
this
style
and
beer
in
general
havent
had
many
beers
really
surprise
me
lately
so
needless
to
say
i
am
happy
this
beer
blew
me
away
the
way
the
sweet
orange
and
peppery
spices
mix
the
dryness
tartness
alcohol
warmth
everything
just
makes
this
beer
complete
well
done
shorts

a
very
delicious
beer
and
an
excellent
way
to
celebrate
their
sixth
year
of
production
very
good
job
shorts
i
want
to
try
it
aged
but
dont
think
i
would
have
the
discipline
to
do
so
yum
the
flavor
was
smooth
and
insanely
fruity
bursting
with
blood
red
orange
starting
sweet
and
finishing
tart
some
light
spice
follows
you
throughout
this
beer
mingling
with
acidity
from
the
fruit
almost
teasing
you
throughout
your
journey
there
is
a
nice
acidic
finish
and
a
buttery
caramel
flavor
that
lingers
it
has
a
medium
full
body
and
light
carbonation
highly
drinkable
as
a
good
night
cap
d
interesting
but
quite
nice
just
a
touch
too
much
pepper
on
the
finish
but
overall
easy
to
drink
not
sure
if
ill
hunt
this
out
again
but
glad
i
got
to
try
this
overall
the
spicy
flavors
balance
what
would
be
an
epically
sweet
beer
making
it
something
new
and
unique
excellent
overall
very
winelike
dry
tart
fruity
and
little
carbonation
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
it
follows
form
pretty
well
glad
i
got
to
taste
this
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
found
it
to
be
just
a
little
bit
weird
for
my
taste
it
is
dark
amber
with
no
head
or
lacing
smells
like
oranges
and
mango
and
tastes
like
wheat
and
oranges
very
citrusy
and
odd
not
very
drinkable
to
me
due
to
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
the
odd
citrus
pretty
good
but
also
weird
which
makes
sense
for
shorts
a
very
interesting
beer
that
you
wont
find
anywhere
else
definitely
worth
trying
very
drinkable
great
beer
i
am
impressed
with
the
creativity
of
shorts
brewery
they
dont
disappoint
and
i
think
they
are
always
worth
a
try
cheers
d
another
cool
beer
from
shorts
i
liked
the
addition
of
the
fruit
in
this
one
and
found
it
to
be
a
bit
sweet
and
at
nearly
12
abv
this
is
one
that
you
need
to
drink
with
caution
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
in
my
tulipshaped
glass
smells
of
blood
oranges
soft
cheese
rind
and
rose
water
but
also
a
bit
musty
and
metallic
the
aroma
gets
much
more
complex
and
floral
as
the
beer
warms
up
to
room
temperature
tastes
tart
with
blood
oranges
melding
with
the
hops
in
a
peculiar
way
green
peppercorn
emerges
towards
the
finish
with
ample
bitterness
a
touch
metallic
and
tart
slightly
tannic
in
the
finish
when
cold
but
gets
juicier
with
more
peppery
heat
as
it
warms
up
surprisingly
dry
for
a
wheat
wine
and
rather
potent
filtered
with
no
yeast
apparent
a
very
interesting
beer
that
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
to
room
temperature
some
of
the
individual
flavors
almost
seemed
offensive
at
colder
temperatures
but
as
the
warms
up
its
magic
fruity
tartness
greets
the
tongue
along
with
a
bit
of
peppery
bitterness
rhubarb
and
tart
cherry
pie
follow
before
a
nice
dollop
of
fruity
sweetness
strawberry
mandarin
orange
and
sweet
cherry
come
through
hints
of
toffee
and
banana
bread
sneak
in
along
with
some
warming
alcohol
fruity
tartness
picks
up
near
the
finish
woody
oaky
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
plenty
of
lingering
fruit
very
nice
more
tartness
than
expected
but
it
balances
the
sweetness
nicely
mediumfull
body
with
low
carbonation
for
a
smooth
flattish
feel
happy
anniversary
shorts
drinkability
not
bad
thank
god
i
had
help
drinking
this
growler
as
there
is
no
way
id
be
able
to
put
the
whole
thing
down
very
tasty
and
super
unique
but
two
glasses
were
plenty
thanks
much
jeff
fairly
alcoholic
very
unique
and
interesting
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
a
wheatwhine
with
a
lot
of
oranges
and
peppercorn
dark
brown
and
lacey
full
mouthfeel
malty
and
licorice
refreshing
and
how
this
would
be
amazing
with
a
meal
was
fairly
average
in
aroma
not
as
complex
as
expected
had
aged
in
bottle
form
and
was
very
rich
thanks
steve
same
rating
all
and
all
another
very
unique
brew
from
shorts
but
i
had
one
glass
at
the
anniversary
party
and
one
this
time
as
well
and
i
dont
think
i
could
really
drink
anymore
than
that
its
pretty
strong
now
in
all
fairness
ive
had
joes
last
3
anniversary
ales
and
all
of
them
have
been
very
very
strong
but
in
the
case
of
a
double
or
triple
ipa
i
think
it
works
better
than
it
does
with
this
wheatwine
still
glad
to
try
it
and
congrats
to
shorts
for
5
yeard
and
continued
success
d
the
high
abv
limited
me
to
only
one
of
these
but
im
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
beer
definitely
a
different
experience
doutstanding
this
would
get
another
5
if
it
wasnt
for
the
alcohol
tickle
and
the
fact
that
the
11
8
abv
will
surely
kick
you
on
your
ass
in
no
time
happy
5th
anni
to
joe
and
the
entire
shorts
crew
well
done
well
done
indeed
i
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
the
brewery
described
this
beer
as
a
wheat
wine
and
the
description
stated
that
they
used
a
half
a
pound
of
blood
oranges
per
gallon
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
has
a
huge
tropical
aroma
of
grapefruit
pineapple
and
orange
the
taste
is
incredibly
sweet
with
grapefruit
and
orange
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
relatively
thick
and
nicely
carbonated
hands
down
the
most
interesting
and
complex
beer
i
have
had
so
far
this
year
highly
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
joe
and
crew
again
show
they
can
work
magic
with
the
hops
served
with
a
blood
orange
if
desired
at
the
pub
which
is
a
nice
touch
this
beer
is
certainly
best
enjoyed
fresh
but
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
some
age
might
do
if
it
would
go
barleywine
like
aorta
has
and
if
some
of
the
added
spices
might
shine
thru
more
strongly
delicious
thanks
shorts
i
simply
loved
this
beer
nice
and
dark
but
not
so
heavy
to
make
it
hard
to
drink
o
far
from
an
expert
onthe
style
but
it
seems
a
solid
variant
from
the
typical
barleywine
id
think
the
wheat
would
add
some
smoothness
it
seemed
to
but
cut
the
dark
fruit
tastes
a
bit
seemed
to
i
just
think
this
offering
lacks
depth
which
might
be
a
discerning
attribute
from
a
barleywine
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
overall
i
think
the
age
has
smoothed
things
out
very
nice
overall
the
crazy
thing
is
that
this
dark
wheat
wine
tastes
along
the
lines
as
some
barleywines
the
wheat
does
add
a
bit
of
soft
mouthfeel
to
the
beer
too
aged
for
2
years
in
a
bottle
and
worth
the
wait
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
confluent
skeletal
surface
etch
of
light
brown
foam
smells
of
candied
dates
some
belgian
sugar
some
hints
of
toasted
malts
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
some
cocoa
powder
and
a
little
tawny
character
nice
tastes
sweet
with
toasted
brown
sugar
graham
some
candied
yams
and
plums
tea
rice
and
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
extract
syrup
yummy
beer
a
bit
like
a
simple
syrup
low
carb
and
a
forgettable
finish
i
dont
know
that
this
really
fits
the
wheatwine
category
but
i
think
this
particular
take
on
the
beer
to
be
fucking
brilliant
i
would
even
consider
tossing
a
little
bit
of
belgian
yeast
into
this
to
give
it
a
touch
more
depth
original
review
on
08232010
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
deep
dark
cola
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
was
gone
quickly
alot
of
dark
fruit
and
sweet
toffee
in
the
nosefaint
toasted
wheat
mixed
with
sharp
alcohol
sweetness
comes
into
play
more
as
it
warmed
really
sweet
on
the
palate
with
spiced
cherry
flavors
as
well
as
some
mild
chocolate
and
faint
wheat
malt
again
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
makes
the
sweetness
even
more
intense
its
not
bad
but
gets
a
little
cloying
about
mid
glassits
a
sipper
thats
for
sure
d
this
was
not
as
impressive
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
this
beer
came
out
quite
well
it
is
a
sipper
and
can
be
enjoyed
with
dessert
dark
chocolate
or
strong
cheeses
give
it
a
try
and
be
patient
with
it
o
delighted
ive
had
a
bunch
of
barleywines
and
maybe
2
rye
beers
and
maybe
2
witbiers
as
well
but
this
beer
stands
alone
it
has
aspects
of
all
three
styles
but
is
a
really
nice
bold
brew
with
a
great
aftertaste
gimme
another
it
reminds
me
of
an
olden
times
beer
like
medieval
almost
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
it
would
be
great
in
a
6oz
pour
but
12oz
is
too
much
and
not
very
enjoyable
after
a
while
i
will
cellar
the
rest
and
try
them
as
i
go
o
triticus
is
an
above
average
wheatwine
i
probably
wouldnt
make
it
a
repeat
purchase
although
id
be
very
interested
in
trying
some
of
the
different
wine
barrel
treatments
those
sound
tasty
oa
decent
wheatwine
however
the
nose
was
off
putting
and
you
can
detect
some
alcohol
o
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
though
i
dont
think
id
add
it
to
my
regular
rotation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
im
not
always
a
fan
of
beers
that
are
the
dark
version
of
a
style
you
already
know
but
this
one
seems
to
take
wheat
wine
in
an
interesting
direction
im
glad
i
got
it
as

poured
a
1
mocha
head
which
seemed
to
draw
all
the
carbonation
out
of
the
body
which
was
flat
thereafter
dark
as
coffee
very
mild
almost
no
smell
but
subtle
hints
of
malt
taste
is
sweet
and
hoppy
and
pretty
strong
despite
the
lack
of
smell
and
has
dried
fruits
and
toffee
theres
a
hop
bitterness
along
moderate
ipa
scale
a
mixed
bag
in
this
beer
flavor
has
a
smidge
of
bitterness
with
some
choco
and
subtle
toffee
mixed
in
here
is
a
grapey
vinous
quality
this
was
more
noticeable
in
their
original
triticus
series
but
still
present
here
in
their
small
format
the
choco
is
of
the
cocoa
variety
a
touch
dry
and
chalky
and
settles
nicely
on
the
palate
decent
though
a
bit
of
a
step
back
from
the
100barrel
series
prosit
1401
from
the
12
fl

bottle
marked

sampled
on

the
pour
is
a
handsome
looking
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
pretty
good
clarity
through
its
opaqueness
powerful
malt
and
chocolate
aromas
penetrate
the
nose
with
a
hop
presence
on
the
backside
the
body
was
about
medium
but
firm
meaning
the
texture
did
not
break
down
into
carbonation
bubbles
while
swirling
the
chocolate
is
a
bit
more
obvious
in
the
taste
than
in
the
aroma
with
a
pungent
strong
hop
bitterness
melding
itself
into
the
experience
it
is
too
bad
that
i
did
not
notice
it
was
a
wheat
winebarley
wine
until
after
i
opened
it
i
wonder
what
it
might
have
tasted
like
at
this
time
next
year
guess
ill
have
to
buy
another
one
and
shelf
it
overall
not
really
gravitating
to
this
much
doesnt
have
much
going
on
o
im
sure
for
the
style
this
is
one
bangup
wheatwine
but
i
dont
really
care
for
sweet
brews
this
was
graciously
given
to
me
by
a
neighbor
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
overall
a
powerful
and
complex
beer
the
alcohol
is
present
but
doesnt
really
interfere
with
the
wide
assortment
of
flavours
i
have
extremely
little
familiarity
with
wheatwines
but
i
certainly
like
this
one
how
to
describe
this
beer
a
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
a
drinkable
barley
wine
at
11

you
wont
be
grabbing
one
of
these
to
cool
off
after
a
hot
day
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
heavy
or
cloying
or
overpowering
to
the
tastes
relax
and
sip
this
one
but
enjoy
its
subtle
friendliness
and
dont
harass
it
for
an
explosion
of
flavors
and
sensations
that
you
may
quickly
grow
tired
of
its
a
good
thing
it
comes
in
a
4
pack
because
you
will
be
reaching
for
another
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
slick
black
with
a
tanish
white
head
what
lacing
that
leaves
is
gorgeous
smell
is
dark
fruit
chocolate
a
little
bready
and
some
booze
taste
is
that
a
little
sweeter
than
the
smell
would
let
on
nice
body
and
enough
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
probably
close
to
a
year
old
think
i
like
the
way
the
flavors
are
now
than
fresh
but
taste
buds
are
ever
evolving
a
hot
big
beer
with
a
caramel
dark
fruit
barleywine
feel
the
alcohol
feel
and
flavor
are
my
only
complaints
but
they
do
not
nearly
ruin
the
whole
experience
o
as
expected
from
a
leviathan
beer
it
has
big
aroma
and
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
high
alcohol
level
the
alcohol
is
blended
very
well
in
this
beer
for
11
it
has
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
and
the
flavors
are
present
in
the
beer
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
smoke
which
compliments
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
the
spiciness
which
is
present
in
the
finish
also
helps
balance
the
sweetness
level
of
the
beer
harpoon
really
made
a
solid
big
beer
pours
an
almost
opaque
cola
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
a
nice
curtain
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
wheat
bread
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
spices
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
dark
bread
dried
fruit
and
some
spices
there
is
an
alcohol
twang
on
the
tongue
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
thick
and
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
wheatwine
with
a
better
smell
than
taste
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavors
based
on
the
aromas
i
get
from
this
one
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
tried
in
the
leviathan
series
having
now
tried
almost
all
of
them
and
is
one
of
the
few
in
that
series
that
i
would
regularly
purchase
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
quite
delicious
and
the
heavy
sugars
are
nicely
tempered
by
the
wheat
flavors
in
much
the
same
way
that
a
good
bowl
of
oatmeal
fresh
berries
and
maple
syrup
makes
for
a
perfect
combination
only
the
slightly
overpronounced
alcohol
whang
keeps
this
from
being
a
nearperfect
beer
in
my
books
well
worth
trying
i
normally
knock
strong
boozy
beers
but
this
beer
really
mixed
the
booze
in
well
with
the
other
flavors
pours
a
very
dark
ebony
color
that
is
nearly
black
really
thin
collar
nose
brings
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
plus
a
bit
of
light
anise
character
flavor
is
slightly
roasted
with
some
very
mild
sweetness
mouthfeel
brings
everything
together
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
plus
some
light
cherry
character
on
the
backend
much
better
as
it
warms
and
fairly
nice
overall
id
go
for
this
again
overall
i
enjoyed
triticus
it
was
easier
to
drink
than
i
thought
not
amazing
not
earthshattering
but
a
fine
enjoyable
as
to
whether
this
is
a
wheatwine
or
not
the
aroma
was
full
of
spices
and
wheat
very
musty
with
a
deep
down
and
earthy
note
to
it
i
was
picking
up
lots
of
rye
type
smells
hints
of
grass
and
a
touch
of
grapes
translated
over
the
taste
very
well
very
rich
wheat
flavor
lots
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
there
were
touches
of
almost
musty
pepper
or
something
hard
to
place
but
very
full
and
very
difficult
to
fully
grasp
the
flavor
nice
hot
streak
of
alcohol
running
through
it
as
well
nice
medium
body
with
a
really
good
carbonation
profile
there
was
a
nice
fullness
to
it
o
not
the
smoothest
of
big
brews
but
nonetheless
enjoyable
if
youre
looking
for
a
post
meal
nightcap
with
some
balls
enjoyed
slowly
d
pretty
drinkable
however
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
the
flavors
and
big
and
strong
and
fairly
complex
the
richness
of
the
fruit
and
caramel
sugar
flavors
are
really
nicely
balanced
d
this
is
a
sipper
for
surei
could
drink
2
of
these
back
to
back
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
if
i
see
this
around
i
will
buy
a
couple
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
good
depth
a
little
dark
but
otherwise
a
tasty
wheatwine
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
bit
of
warmth
feels
almost
thin
but
pretty
solid
and
easy
to
drink
not
bad
stuff

and
mild

nice
wheatwine
beer
that
i
rarely
get
my
hands
on
d
this
was
nothing
outrageous
but
it
was
super
well
integrated
and
balanced
quite
a
tasty
drink
although
it
was
a
bit
hot
especially
in
the
scent
it
still
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
and
age
may
help
further
mellow
it

well

drinkable

this
beer
is
a
hot
muddled
sweet
mess
my
favorite
wheatwines
have
are
a
hot
sweet
wheaty
mess
that
somehow
comes
together
this
one
feels
raw
unfinished
im
going
to
stuff
my
remaining
bottle
into
a
dark
corner
forget
about
it
until
2015
then
try
again
right
now
just
a
decent
brew
d
glad
i
tried
probably
would
not
seek
this
out
again
though
good
not
great
poured
into
my
glass
served
at
about
50
degrees
very
dark
color
with
a
small
amount
of
ruby
coloring
slight
head
more
like
a
thick
film
on
the
top
that
disappears
only
minor
alcohol
scents
other
than
that
no
smell
mild
flavors
of
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
no
real
fruity
nature
that
i
would
have
expected
alcohol
is
very
warming
and
relaxing
wow
thats
all
i
can
say
this
is
nothing
i
ever
would
have
expected
from
a
wheat
beer
pours
very
dark
with
just
a
hint
of
red
with
a
very
tan
creamy
head
you
can
defiantly
decern
the
winestyle
in
this
one
with
a
very
strong
alcohol
flavor
that
compliment
this
brew
very
well
its
is
very
think
malty
and
has
a
nice
coffee
flavor
it
is
rather
low
on
the
drinkiblity
because
it
is
so
strong
in
flavor
and
alcohol
great
brew
12
ounce
bottle
split
with
a
couple
friends
last
weekend
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
lingering
tan
head
nice
fruity
aromas
along
with
wheat
caramel
and
toffee
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
flavors
of
wheat
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruits
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
oatmeal
and
molasses
in
the
taste
sweet
oatmeal
molasses
stickiness
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
pinch
of
alcohol
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
sticky
roasty
malt
i
thought
this
was
a
stout
no
wheat
hints
at
all
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
a
wheatwine
in
the
pursuit
of
the
ultimate
wheatwine
this
beer
falls
flat
outside
of
style
i
would
call
this
decent
but
not
what
i
am
looking
for
or
expecting
when
striving
for
wheatwine
darker
malt
flavors
than
the
smell
suggests
theres
some
burnt
toast
taste
to
counteract
the
mild
sweetness
nice
bitterness
in
the
swallow
i
dont
taste
any
wheat
though
not
a
thick
beer
it
has
a
decent
body
i
think
with
a
bit
more
time
this
would
be
quite
good
but
id
sooner
reach
for
smuttynoses
wheat
wine
i
grabbed
this
beer
based
on
prior
experience
with
the
leviathan
series
pours
a
deep
ruby
near
black
and
is
thick
reminding
me
of
used
motor
oil
i
was
struck
by
the
amazing
smell
of
this
beer
tons
of
subtle
malt
smell
with
a
delicate
but
identifiable
hops
zest
around
the
edges
the
hop
smell
is
earthy
with
a
bit
of
citrus
to
taste
this
beer
i
expected
something
like
an
old
ale
meets
a
wheat
wine
i
actually
tasted
a
subtle
malt
bomb
that
is
all
wheat
wine
with
some
subtle
hopping
unfortunately
the
hop
flavors
become
undetectable
after
the
first
few
sips
luckily
the
over
all
flavor
of
this
beer
is
good
i
was
only
hit
by
how
sweet
this
beer
becomes
as
it
warms
up
pours
a
surprisingly
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
lingers
on
the
edges
throughout
the
beer
first
smells
bring
out
sweetness
with
malty
notes
and
an
alcohol
aroma
the
beers
abv
is
11
5
which
is
not
for
the
timid
beer
drinker
the
taste
is
strong
with
caramel
maltiness
with
hints
of
smoke
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
beer
finishes
with
mild
pepper
notes
that
tend
to
linger
with
a
slight
alcoholic
after
taste
the
beer
boasts
a
good
carbonation
that
lasts
even
as
the
beer
warms
i
highly
recommend
this
for
beer
lovers
who
enjoy
a
strong
dark
taste
especially
in
the
winter
pours
a
three
finger
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good

bodied
nose

from

better
beers
hooksett
nh
carbonation
low
drinkability
for
a
wheatwine
is
pretty
good
most
wheatwines
have
a
very
light
mouthfeel
as
does
this
however
if
you
sit
on
one
glass
for
a
long
while
as
it
is
intended
i
think
it
gets
decent
drinkability
as
well
i
have
no
problem
with
high
alcohol
beers
ive
given
as
to
several
beers
with
a
higher
abv
than
this
however
this
beer
tastes
like
hard
liquor
that
alludes
to
various
beer
styles
stout
weizenbock
to
be
blunt
this
beer
is
awful
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
there
is
a
big
fingerprint
of
alcohol
as
well
as
a
flavorful
body
that
sits
down
in
your
lap
till
you
finish
it
it
goes
down
well
and
at
points
is
easier
than
a
barleywine
at
times
when
it
goes
down
d
the
alcohol
is
a
blugdeon
unfortunately
for
this
one
md
the
beer
had
a
heavy
body
and
with
the
high
alcohol
content
one
should
probably
not
enjoy
more
than
one
and
any
sitting
the
beer
was
creamy
but
it
felt
a
little
watered
down
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
unsure
as
to
why
it
is
called
a
wheat
wine
when
i
really
didnt
get
any
characteristics
of
a
wheat
beer
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
one
is
enough
two
is
just
on
the
verge
of
too
much
insanely
drinkable
to
me
for
the
abv
the
taste
is
huge
as
well
boozy
tons
of
sugary
raisin
wheaty
chalkiness
on
the
palate
cloying
just
not
good
messy
mouthfeel
is
medium
low
carbonation
just
not
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
i
drain
poured
the
second
half
a
beautiful
brown
color
but
no
head
though
not
the
best
offering
nose
has
a
high
alcohol
scent
with
a
bitter
wheat
undertones
the
taste
is
sour
bitter
and
without
much
goodness
mouthfeel
is
a
mediumfull
body
that
has
a
slight
oil
trail
im
not
that
impressed
as
the
alcohol
and
the
wheat
really
seems
to
take
over
everything
else
heavy
body
sticky
almost
cumbersome
at
points
on
the
tongue
slow
drinking
due
to
higher
abv
which
is
usually
fine
but
some
of
the
flavors
were
a
little
tougher
to
enjoy
as
well
not
a
poor
beer
but
might
improve
with
some
further
age
d
maybe
with
some
time
will
help
but
for
the
moment
its
just
a
bit
messy
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
is
murky
brown
in
appearance
with
a
sticky
2
finger
head
sweet
smell
even
had
a
hint
of
bubble
gum
bubble
gum
and
some
spinciness
finish
with
a
lingering
amount
of
alcohol
full
bodied
and
creamy
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
solid
wheatwine
but
not
best
in
class
this
was
just
disgusting
i
had
an
immediate
visceral
dislike
to
it
and
threw
it
out
doesnt
age
well
d
a
sipper
and
nothing
more
than
that
to
be
sure
its
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
from
what
ive
had
its
good
regardless
the
wheatwine
style
is
unfamiliar
territory
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
ebony
with
a
white
head
the
beer
has
aromas
of
molasses
sun
dried
raisins
and
prunes
initial
taste
has
hits
of
molasses
and
cinnamon
with
a
medium
body
the
beer
coats
the
tongue
nicely
and
washes
away
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
despite
the
alcohol
content
there
really
isnt
much
presence
of
it
making
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
through
the
fall
winter
and
spring
months
in
conclusion
this
beer
encourages
further
exploration
of
the
wheatwine
style
verdict
triticus
is
a
unique
and
fascinating
brew
its
big
complex
astonishingly
drinkable
and
fun
throughout
i
havent
had
many
wheatwines
but
this
is
certainly
the
best
ive
tried
yet
harpoon
continues
to
thoroughly
impresses
me
with
the
leviathan
series
this
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
huge
liquorish
flavor
really
not
much
of
a
wheatwine
either
overall
worth
a
try
but
more
of
a
one
and
done
than
anything
for
me
good
drinkability
except
for
the
high
abv
notes
the
flavors
and
aromas
in
this
beer
were
muted
until
i
let
it
warm
i
let
it
get
to
near
room
temperature
before
it
really
opened
up
i
have
never
seen
dark
malts
used
to
this
degree
in
a
wheatwine
before
but
it
is
a
most
welcome
addition
this
is
one
of
the
best
wheatwines
ive
had
though
i
havent
had
many
had
lunch
at
sunset
in
allston
this
past
saturday
afternoon
and
ordered
a
triticus
with
my
meal
served
in
a
12
oz
tulip
glass
and
cost
about
6
dark
brown
color
thin
white
head
and
a
small
bit
of
lacing
smell
was
faintly
of
coffee
and
black
licorice
taste
was
very
inviting
tastes
of
ripe
fruit
that
were
overlaid
with
the
flavors
of
heavily
roasted
grains
mouthfeel
was
actually
the
biggest
and
most
pleasant
surprise
here
for
a
wheatwine
at
11
5
this
beer
was
extremely
smooth
on
the
palate
the
abv
was
hidden
quite
well
very
easy
beer
to
drink
considering
the
style
paired
well
with
a
pork
sandwich
i
am
glad
that
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
try
the
bros
beer
after
all
this
time
notes
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
it
maybe
some
aging
would
soothe
the
boozy
beast
earning
some
smoothness
and
a
longer
range
dinteresting
flavors
all
come
together
nicely
not
really
tasting
any
wheat
but
good
nonetheless
sharp
and
roasty
and
definitely
bubblegummy
bitter
and
strongly
hopped
grassy
and
generally
citrussy
but
not
a
nw
grapefruity
bomb
significantly
roastier
tasting
than
smelling
frankly
in
a
bind
taste
test
i
would
have
picked
porter
the
finish
is
where
the
wheat
shows
i
can
see
why
people
describe
wheat
and
rye
as
spicy
this
brew
features
something
i
might
be
tempted
to
identify
as
such
but
its
more
like
grainy
whatever
it
is
its
sharp
juxtaposed
next
to
richness
and
sweetness
good
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
drink
this
again
d
as
drinkable
as
a
beer
like
this
can
be
i
enjoyed
it
as
a
sipper
and
took
an
hour
to
get
through
10oz
and
really
enjoyed
it
they
should
make
this
year
round
and
get
rid
of
their
saison
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
complex
array
of
malt
scents
pale
and
dark
wheat
crystal
malts
its
rich
and
creamy
with
a
slight
roasted
character
and
a
mild
alcohol
warmth
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
silky
smooth
wheat
and
caramel
malt
flavor
its
rich
and
slightly
fruity
with
some
hop
spiciness
and
some
mild
heat
in
the
finish
there
is
a
good
deal
of
depth
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
its
a
slow
drinker
thats
rich
and
creamy
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
hear
its
a
darker
version
of
the
original
100
barrel
recipe
regardless
its
a
damn
fine
wheatwine
d
the
alcohol
catches
up
at
the
end
but
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
one
is
easily
finished
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
open
another
in
the
same
sitting
id
probably
get
it
again
though
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
even
though
it
was
not
like
any
wheat
wine
ive
ever
tasted
i
also
thought
it
was
a
touch
too
spicy
small
complaints
very
rich
but
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
present
but
warming
not
offensive
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
layer
of
fine
yellowbeige
bubbles
and
a
slightly
soapy
collar
spotty
lacing
good

retention
for
whats
there
since
it
didnt
produce

from
a
hard
pour
smells
rich

sweet
lots
of

solid
bitterness
up

sort
of

combination
of
hops
and
dark
grains
with
alcohol
taking
over
towards
the

in
between
theres
a
lot
of
malt
character
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
dried
fruits
figs
and
raisins
slight
cinnamon
spice
full
heavy
body
with
fine
lowish
carbonation
quite
drinkable
considering
the

not
what
i
think
of
when
i
imagine
wheatwine
yields
to
the
