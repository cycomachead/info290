overall
impression
while
ordering
this
euro
strong
lager
i
enjoyed
it
greatly
but
would
argue
that
this
is
no
lager
at
all
too
strong
and
boozy
with
almost
a
barleywine
mouthfeel
and
many
other
styles
american
brown
eisbock
etc
put
together
im
glad
i
tried
something
of
their
specialty
but
would
like
to
ask
a
brewmaster
here
next
time
of
course
what
this
beer
entails
and
what
style
it
is
drinkability
needs
work
its
not
the
strongest
beer
in
the
worl
either
as
claims
too
sweet
and
boozy
d
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
from
both
the
smell
and
taste
which
make
this
beer
go
down
rather
easily
however
it
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
given
its
strength
pretty
solid
effort
the
flip
top
pretty
much
exploded
off
when
i
lifted
the
lock
sprayed
me
with
a
mist
of
caramel
smelling
beer
better
than
my
cologne
smell
that
n
even
id
go
out
with
me
something
i
dont
ordinarily
do
poured
with
a
fine
thick
small
to
medium
sized
light
tan
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
leaving
kind
of
a
scummy
layer
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
hazycloudy
deep
medium
amber
aroma
is
hugely
caramel
with
toffee
malt
fruit
slightly
floral
flavors
like
aroma
plus
oranges
nutmeats
and
a
bit
of
tartness
from
somewhere
really
works
out
over
all
body
is
as
expected
full
round
luscious
and
nicely
cut
with
the
good
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
much
nicer
in
bottles
than
on
draft
at
the
pub
nice
dessert
sipping
brew
i
think
they
even
offer
it
at
the
pub
as
an
ice
cream
treat
drinkability
fine
in
conclusion
for
once
its
safe
to
ignore
your
curiosity
and
get
something
less
interesting
their
oldgott
is
actually
quite
good
and
is
13
the
price
or
go
somewhere
else
and
get
5
decent
beers
for
the
price
of
this
one
after
three
sips
i
have
poured
the
beer
in
the
toilet
and
that
is
something
i
will
not
do
very
fast
drinkability
interesting
to
try
once
cant
say
i
would
drink
it
again
must
be
an
aquired
taste
more
like
a
dessert
beer
something
to
sip
on
the
aftertaste
is
boarding
on
sickly
the
rich
sweetness
stays
a
little
to
long
in
the
mouth
i
can
see
why
other
reviewers
have
complained
about
the
sweet
nature
of
the
beer
and
the
lack
of
an
alcohol
feel
the
sweetness
certainly
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drive
a
car
even
after
only
one
agree
with
everyone
else
who
has
reviewed
this
beer
it
is
way
too
sweet
and
i
believe
not
as
strong
as
they
claim
it
to
be
its
as
though
it
did
not
attenuate
all
the
way
the
advertise
it
as
the
strongest
lager
in
the
world
worth
a
sip
but
not
much
more
some
wod
in
the
back
but
not
our
beer
perhaps
the
most
unusual
beer
i
had
in
pragueworth
walking
an
extra
kilometer
to
try
one
of
the
great
beers
a
pleasant
ride
of
taste
if
you
go
to
prague
it
is
a
must
to
taste
this
one
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
and
inebriated
me
at
apx
55f
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
grassy
nose
and
flavor
is
a
lot
of
caramel
sweetness
hiding
the
very
high
abv
strange
sweet
bitter
aftertaste
4
80
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
they
are
who
they
thought
it
would
be
so
everyone
of
us
who
are
rating
this
beer
are
doing
so
because
we
bought
it
because
of
the
high
abv
at
15
this
is
almost
as
high
as
it
gets
but
thats
where
the
positives
pretty
much
end
this
beer
has
a
putrid
aroma
it
smells
rotten
i
had
to
check
the
dates
to
make
sure
it
was
still
drinkable
it
poured
a
nice
golden
color
had
way
too
much
carbonation
and
a
decent
amount
of
lace
it
is
too
sweet
to
enjoy
and
very
acidic
and
pungent
has
a
very
strong
and
bitter
taste
similar
to
sulfur
while
it
is
still
better
than
a
bud
light
i
would
only
recommend
getting
this
for
the
novelty
factory
3
sips
and
had
to
dump
it
down
the
drain
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
o
15
3
at
15
piqued
my
interest
hadnt
heard
of
brewery
and
the
label
seemed
promising
i
was
swindled
its
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beverages
ive
ever
had
i
struggled
through
half
of
a
16
9oz
bottle
before
finally
dumping
it
which
i
always
try
to
avoid
i
wonder
if
this
is
brewed
as
some
kind
of
cruel
joke
if
i
could
go
back
and
unpurchase
it
i
would
its
definitely
crazy
so
i
guess
mission
accomplished
o
well
i
survived
the
beer
did
not
my
first
drainpour
o
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
shot
for
3
whats
to
lose
it
wasnt
awesome
but
it
was
better
then
i
thought
it
would
be
half
liter
bottle
pours
out
nearly
clear
copper
gold
with
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
offers
up
sickly
sweet
sugary
malts
a
sweet
mead
like
quality
and
a
cheap
maple
syrup
covered
apple
and
pear
slices
like
sensation
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
like
i
was
expecting
i
get
a
sugary
sweetness
a
pleasing
and
trying
to
be
dry
yeastiness
that
cuts
the
sweetness
with
a
slightly
nutty
like
maltiness
and
a
strong
alcoholic
finish
which
brings
my
overall
rating
of
this
brew
down
pours
a
dark
corn
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
head
that
thins
to
a
lace
smells
like
a
standard
euro
lager
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
somewhat
fruity
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
its
smell
except
the
alcohol
is
definitely
more
prominent
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
somewhat
bitter
i
dont
really
recommend
this
beer
for
9
5
its
pretty
bland
and
the
aftertaste
is
the
same
as
a
bud
out
of
a
bomber
bottle
all
the
way
from
lithuania
this
beer
which
i
sampled
at
the
russian
house
in
washington
d
c
was
a
dark
goldennearly
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
lighting
the
retention
was
soso
the
lacing
scattered
the
aroma
was
punchy
lots
of
booze
and
dry
grains
it
was
also
served
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
which
did
little
for
the
aroma
the
flavors
were
very
much
like
a
spiked
lager
beer
imagine
a
corona
spiked
with
vodka
i
tasted
dry
grains
alcohol
heat
and
little
else
beyond
hints
of
wood
but
otherwise
it
tasted
just
as
it
smelled
it
wasnt
unpleasant
and
certainly
if
one
wanted
to
get
fed
up
it
would
be
efficient
and
superior
to
most
american
malt
liquors
which
sport
similar
percentages
however
i
wouldnt
quickly
recommend
it
especially
to
beerlovers
who
tend
to
be
snobs
what
happened
to
you
people
but
doubtless
one
can
give
it
props
for
rarity
the
mouthfeel
was
frothy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
light
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
golden
orange
color
small
white
head
forms
smell
is
clean
mildly
sweet
and
alittle
lagerlike
in
the
taste
lemony
twang
of
spent
hops
sweet
grains
mimicking
dirty
raw
honey
theee
is
an
odd
somewhat
sour
twang
of
hops
and
super
sweet
malt
these
factors
hide
the
alcohol
well
which
is
a
much
needed
success
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
somewhat
crisp
overall
an
interesting
brew
lithuanian
premium
malt
liquor
hows
that
for
a
new
beer
style
mouthfeel
is
flat
thick
and
sticky
overall
i
think
im
not
finishing
this
beer
overall
again
i
dont
love
the
taste
but
maybe
just
because
its
different
but
because
its
different
is
why
i
like
it
as
a
beer
d
decent
allthough
not
what
i
expected
from
the
labelextra
stout
and
at
9
could
not
do
many
of
these
but
the
taste
is
not
a
bad
one
if
i
wanted
to
get
pissed
drunk
could
drink
about
4
and
would
be
very
much
on
my
way
d
the
lager
has
an
alcoholic
flavor
like
mouthwash
without
the
peppermint
on
the
upside
its
cheap
and
provides
a
nearinstant
buzz
taste
i
bought
it
because
it
was
a
lithuanian
beer
thought
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
it
is
unbalanced
and
seems
too
sweet
for
a
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
is
kind
of
boring
and
not
complex
not
very
good
and
probably
wont
try
again
the
only
quality
of
this
beer
that
makes
it
worth
trying
once
is
that
it
captures
the
spirit
of
postsoviet
eastern
europe
of
the
1990s
quite
well
rogue
rough
anythinggoes
highly
alcoholic
with
the
smell
of
industrial
decay
burning
factory
nearby
umm
why
does
the
label
say
this
beer
is
extra
stout
my
guess
is
because
people
will
think
it
is
a
stout
until
a
stream
of
clear
yellowgold
comes
flowing
out
average
white
head
some
lacing
nondescript
chunks
in
the
bottom
hardcandy
sugary
nose
with
some
banana
kind
of
medicinal
the
taste
is
well
bad
sweet
to
a
sickening
level
haystraw
flavors
if
they
were
dipped
in
sugar
here
is
where
the
nasty
oversweet
grape
candy
flavor
punches
you
its
identical
to
the
taste
of
a
supercheap
purple
jellybean
i
hope
this
isnt
the
best
lithuania
has
to
offer
pours
a
murky
gold
with
huge
chunks
of
offputting
sediment
floating
around
the
head
wisps
away
quickly
no
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
of
honey
and
malts
tastes
malty
and
some
alcohol
in
the
background
the
alcohol
becomes
hot
and
pervasive
after
a
few
drinks
its
cloying
and
a
bit
thin
and
weak
cant
do
this
one
dotson
i
feel
like
it
should
get
some
points
for
originality
but
it
would
loose
on
plating
and
taste
a
buddy
of
mine
that
i
worked
with
suggested
that
i
give
this
beer
a
try
i
did
it
was
an
okay
beer
that
tasted
kinda
like
malt
liquor
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
body
with
a
small
large
bubbled
head
that
quickly
vanishes
scattered
wisps
of

are
left
behind
aroma
is
golden
delicious
apples
and
booze
light
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
but
has
a
sickly
sweetness
taste
has
fruity
apple
notes
lots
of
alcohol
and
a
very
bready
maltiness
no
hop
presence
syrupy
sweetness
grows
sickly
after
a
couple
of
sips
most
of
this
one
goes
down
the
drain
d
moderate
drinkablilty
some
sweet
honey
alcohol
upon
warming
overall
not
bad
a
step
above
mediocre
it
tastes
like
cheap
candy
and
not
good
cheap
candy
that
will
lull
you
into
a
state
of
nostalgia
this
is
im
not
going
to
that
house
next
year
on
halloween
cheap
candy
after
a
glass
what
was
left
in
the
bottle
went
down
the
drain
lithuanian
ghetto
liquor
very
sweet
with
an
alcohol
kick
sweet
candy
corn
aroma
nice
pour
strong
carbonation
real
cool
to
watch
sticky
sugary
mouthfeel
candy
flavor
common
among
the
beers
ive
had
from
this
country
but
there
is
nothing
to
back
the
sweet
taste
very
one
dimensional
and
definitely
a
slammer
d
i
tried
this
one
just
for
the
experience
of
trying
a
lithuanian
beer
it
seems
to
exist
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
drinker
completely
wasted
not
for
the
enjoyment
of
drinking
its
not
a
nice
beer
to
drink
dont
really
know
what
to
say
it
looks
sort
of
like
pee
smells
like
alcohol
and
sweetness
and
grain
and
tastes
the
same
feel
is
okay
havent
been
too
impressed
with
anything
ive
gotten
from
eastern
europe
so
far
im
talking
about
beer
here
people
this
is
my

lithuanian
malt
liquor
pours
out
to
a
syrupy
golden
orange
color
wiht
nearly
no
head
of
foam
aroma
of
alcohol
and
sweet
grains
mixed
with

taste
is

strong

is

is

in
its
acidity
and
skunk

rjt
i
will
congratulate
you
if
you
could
finish
this
one
i
do
not
like
it
and
finishing
it
is
really
tough
o
very
easy
drinking
this
beer
does
well
at
hiding
the
9
5
alcohol
not
overly
complex
but
a
good
enjoyable
lager
this
doesnt
get
much
love
on
ba
but
i
can
recommend
it
overall
not
a
bad
brew
really
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
that
led
to
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
strong
lager
with
some
deceptiveness
and
good
character
slightly
murky
butterscotch
with
blonde
highlights
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
a
fluffy
eggshell
head
that
leaves
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
pure
candy
maybe
banana
airheads
or
something
with
fruity
esters
and
a
touch
of
grain
alcohol
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
juicyfruit
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
but
not
really
enough
to
balance
this
is
a
high
alcohol
malt
bomb
for
sure
with
a
distinct
caramel
apple
finish
medium
bodied
and
with
sharp
carbonation
and
alcoholic
heat
better
than
some
of
these
crazy
high
octane
euro
malt
liquors
and
not
entirely
unpleasant
but
dont
ever
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
in
spite
of
my
earlier
trepidation
i
am
enjoying
this
strong
lager
this
is
a
malty
alcoholic
monster
that
will
reappear
in
place
of
malt
liquor
poured
with
a
thick
foamy
frothy
cream
colored
sudsy
head
and
some

color
is
a
clear

with
some

aroma
is
beery
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
soap
flavor
is
heavy
malt
sweet
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
body
is
malt
heavy
and
good
carbonation
good

aroma
is

almost
floral
with
a

taste
is
light
and
mildly

and
hoppy
the
light
body
is
without
merit
and
leaves
little
trace
of
anything
at
a
cost
of
2
49
a
bottle
i
expected
more
but
this
brew
does
not
deliver
anything
that
would
induce
me
to
recommend
it
to
others
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
for
some
deepgoldamber
body
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
gently
offwhite
fair
head
retention
and
average
lacing
the
aroma
is
floral
and
fruity
with
a
waft
of
alcohol
over
a
sweetish
malt
base
and
it
at
times
seems
a
bit
fruitcandyish
that
carries
over
into
the
finish
and
it
ends
with
a
sweet
note
of
fruit
candy
as
well
as
a
bit
of
grassy
gently
spicy
and
mildly
herbal
hops
that
fade
to
leave
behind
a
note
of
sweet
licorice
theres
a
pretty
good
deal
of
malt
to
it
as
well
and
its
like
candycoated
caramel
full
bodied
but
also
strong
9
5
and
backed
by
a
stiff
bitterness
that
cuts
through
the
middle
but
just
cant
hold
on
sweetish
yes
but
not
too
unlike
many
russianeastern
european
strong
ales
its
done
in
that
vein
the
difference
is
that
theres
a
bit
more
caramel
malt
here
and
the
hops
are
not
as
herbal
as
usual
so
ok
onwards
to
drinkability
well
for
this
style
its
pretty
good
the
beers
from
this
part
of
the
world
are
pretty
different
but
at
the
same
time
were
not
all
from
there
and
to
a
lot
of
us
it
seems
sweetishmalty
it
actually
tastes
a
little
like
there
was
some
propylene
glycol
added
to
it
to
give
it
a
little
bit
of
a
kick
yeah
i
guess
its
got
a
hint
of
a
medicinal
edge
too
not
enough
to
kill
you
though
if
youre
familiar
with
beers
done
in
this
vein
youll
know
what
youre
getting
into
if
youre
not
and
youre
used
to
more
focused
and
balanced
beers
stay
away
dotson
true
to
the
scent
it
had
a
very
malty
taste
solid
is
about
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
much
better
than
an
american
macro
lager
but
leaves
a
strange
taste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
while
it
has
many
of
the
elements
of
a
macro
the
malts
separate
this
beer
appearance
an
amber
hue
with
little
to
no
head
the
nose
is
hops
malt
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
very
strong
version
of
bud
a
very
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
beer
you
can
taste
the
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
dill
pass
ok
maybe
as
a
midparty
3am
desperation
beer
dinkability
is
not
really
awful
so
i
finished
it
but
i
will
not
buy
another
it
is
maybe
two
points
above
being
a
sink
pour
glad
for
the
experience
be
warned
if
you
have
an
extra
couple
of
bucks
to
experiment
on
new
beer
try
something
else
first
it
comes
from
my
homeland
but
the
truth
is
i
kind
of
wish
it
stayed
there
its
thin
with
little
true
character
and
it
seems
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
lithuanian
macro
it
is
drinkable
well
sure
you
could
say
that
but
so
is
brackish
water
in
a
pinch
so
ill
finish
this
bottle
and
consider
it
a
lesson
learned
always
looking
for
new
beers
to
try
i
found
this
beer
recently
at
my
fav
liquor
store
grouped
with
russian
beers
as
this
is
surely
the
only
lithuanian
beer
marketed
in
the
us
this
beer
came
with
a
special
hard
to
miss
tag
advertising
the
alcohol
content
as
9
5
it
showed
i
was
surprised
upon
pouring
the
beer
that
it
poured
a
nice
copper
colour
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
much
darker
the
beer
certainly
smelled
of
alcohol
but
not
nearly
what
i
was
expecting
the
initial
mouthfeel
was
decent
considering
the
alcohol
content
but
the
aftertaste
was
excessively
strong
malt
and
alcohol
with
the
sweetness
of
honey
sorry
but
i
would
advise
against
this
beer
perhaps
fine
for
those
lithuanian
winters
when
one
runs
out
of
vodka
but
just
too
much
of
an
alcohol
taste
for
my
likes
drinkability
is
not
great
a
good
beer
to
try
and
expand
your
palate
but
not
a
brew
i
would
like
to
have
more
than
a
small
glass
of
for
1
70
a
500ml
put
one
in
your
tasting
club
theyll
be
surprised
with
it
i
was
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
mouthfeel
is
average
i
suppose
i
do
not
see
myself
drinking
many
of
these
i
have
another
warm
on
in
storage
and
i
will
be
in
no
big
hurry
to
get
it
aiko
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
half
liter
brown
bottle
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
in
a
typical
eastern
european
way
also
quite
malty
in
the
flavor
which
is
on
the
sweet
end
there
is
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
alcohol
is
fairly
well
concealed
not
bad
for
what
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
eastern
european
lagers
upon
pouring
from
the
bottle
the
glass
was
filled
with
an
amber
color
with
very
little
head
the
first
smell
i
detected
was
that
of
malt
and
barley
this
was
later
verified
upon
first
taste
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
the
beer
was
crisp
and
refreshing
as
mentioned
before
there
was
a
good
amount
of
malts
and
barley
which
gave
the
beer
a
sweet
taste
that
did
an
excellent
job
of
masking
the
9
5
abv
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
find
kept
this
one
around
for
awhile
before
drinking
kept
thinking
of
some
of
the
other
strong
european
lagers
that
i
have
had
and
figuring
it
would
be
the
same
not
quite
the
case
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
with
little
head
aroma
was
quite
bready
with
hints
of
bubble
gum
taste
was
quite
similar
with
maybe
a
bit
of
banana
thrown
in
tended
toward
the
sweet
which
covered
the
alcohol
well
not
sessionable
but
quite
worth
the
effort
pours
a
golden
amber
with
semilight
sudsy
foam
which
dissipates
quickly
first
taste
is
that
of
grape
koolaid
a
hint
of
root
beer
malt
and
barley
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
but
brought
back
into
balance
with
a
good
dose
of
malted
barley
lists
a
9
5abv
but
it
is
covered
extremely
well
only
a
slight
note
of
alcohol
is
detected
local
store
had
for
4
99
a
six
pack
pleasantly
surprised
for
the
price
wow
this
beer
is
really
foul
if
this
is
considered
an
ok
as
far
as
taste
to
price
for
european
standards
id
like
to
try
a
better
smells
boozy
and
musty
tastes
the
same
with
hints
of
bread
and
banana
typical
for
the
yeasts
used
in
the
baltic
states
i
started
drinking
it
too
cold
but
the
second
half
of
the
bomber
was
poured
into
a
room
temperature
glass
and
was
quite
a
bit
better
thick
full
mouthfeel
feels
like
a
triple
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
beer
with
a
huge
lobster
on
the
label
but
my
expectations
were
not
high
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
id
choose
again
rjt
overall
not
something
i
would
drink
again
just
really
boozy
version
of
a
euro
style
lager
not
very
good
but
for
the
abv
and
price
its
not
a
bad
option
in
that
regard
with
that
said
this
was
my
first
drain
pour
maybe
i
will
put
it
back
to
a
3
at
some
point
as
i
still
have
four
bottles
left
and
want
my
wife
to
try
bottom
line
my
drain
is
even
complaining
about
the
sewage
that
it
was
forced
to
endure
personal
rate
3
o
i
truly
hope
no
one
else
has
to
experience
how
bad
this
beer
tastes
looks
and
smells
fooled
me
if
you
find
yourself
in
lithuania
needing
a
drink
buy
some
vodka
instead
pass
served
from
bottle
into
a
hair
of
the
dog
tulip
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
corn
floral
grain
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
corn
fruit
alcohol
grain
and
floral
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
below
average
brew
i
bought
this
to
amuse
beeruser
and
funkydelic
at
gbx
as
they
laughed
when
they
suggest
that
i
tick
it
phew
i
now
know
why
the
manager
at
trappe
door
described
it
as
hot
trash
not
only
does
this
thing
not
appeal
to
the
palate
it
does
not
do
so
for
the
eye
either
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
one
and
there
was
honestly
no
way
i
could
have
prepared
myself
short
of
pounding
a
few
40s
prior
to
this
one
just
so
harsh
in
flavors
like
nails
on
the
chalkboard
yeah
guys
you
got
me
good
based
on
this
one
lithuania
should
stick
to
whatever
they
are
good
at
and
leave
beer
alone
in
my
opinion
the
beer
pours
like
crisp
apple
juice
or
piss
with
a
quick
firecracker
head
that
disappears
as
fast
as
it
appears
leaving
nothing
the
beer
smells
very
light
with
damp
pilslike
malts
there
is
some
slight
fruity
character
in
the
smell
as
well
but
it
is
very
faint
the
beer
tastes
very
sweet
with
a
candyapple
bite
and
a
very
light
sweet
finish
there
is
also
a
very
strong
butterflavor
traveling
throughout
this
beer
which
is
probably
why
it
is
called
lobster
lovers
and
is
strange
and
smooth
upon
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
super
dry
after
it
passes
through
the
mouth
but
is
very
clean
and
slightly
watery
as
it
passes
through
with
a
light
hint
of
sharp
bubbles
and
a
gelling
feeling
in
the
mouth
this
is
my
first
strong
lager
and
i
am
quite
interested
with
it
the
heavier
malt
bill
seems
to
give
the
lager
a
more
alelike
than
any
lager
i
have
consumed
the
mouthfeel
is
the
major
downside
of
this
beer
leaving
you
thirstier
than
before
the
sip
but
the
taste
is
quite
intriguing
though
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
to
say
the
least
but
im
not
sure
ill
have
it
again
overall
this
beer
will
please
everyone
yes
i
know
it
doesnt
the
greatest
reviews
but
it
is
above
satisfaction
have
one
on
me
salud
overall
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
below
average
to
average
euron
strong
lager
i
havent
had
this
style
before
so
i
cant
say
for
sure
but
beeradvocate
says
that
the
style
is
the
european
version
of
malt
liquor
so
i
think
this
is
right
around
average
and
tastes
similar
to
some
shitty
malt
liquors
i
have
had
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
went
down
a
little
rough
and
it
was
boozy
i
am
glad
i
am
splitting
this
bottle
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
all
by
myself
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
way
it
looked
it
looked
pretty
nice
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
only
flaw
was
the
head
retention
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
taste
they
went
that
good
and
were
overly
sweet
and
boozy
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
wanted
a
beer
that
tasted
like
this
i
would
save
some
money
and
just
a
buy
a
shitty
can
of
malt
liquor
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
even
lithuanians
this
was
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
wasnt
a
fan
which
didnt
make
for
a
good
first
impression
i
have
yet
to
find
a
decent
tasting
lithuanian
beer
but
i
havent
given
up
hope
just
yet
the
search
continues
underneath
the
expected
blast
of
alcohol
and
rough
husky
aromas
are
some
surprising
sweetly
floral
notes
huge
alcohol
and
sweetness
let
this
stuff
warm
at
your
peril
but
it
aint
half
bad
really
just
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
basically
a
fancier
euro
version
of
our
malt
liquor
peppery
and
husky
with
a
touch
of
honey
to
the
malt
profile
a
touch
more
carbonation
might
improve
drinkability
a
bit
for
the
price
point
you
could
certainly
do
worse
pours
a
clean
deep
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
big
alcohol
with
small
fruitiness
mixed
in
there
in
the
taste
a
small
sweetness
of
fruit
and
a
dry
alcohol
presence
all
the
way
through
an
alcohol
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
alcohol
aftertaste
it
took
me
a
minute
but
this
would
compliment
lobster
and
butter
really
well
but
as
a
beer
on
its
own
it
is
struggling
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
at
the
same
time
not
extremely
intriguing
either
o
i
like
the
smell
and
flavor
but
im
much
more
inclined
to
prefer
werewolf
from
the
same
brewer
it
seems
that
the
higher
the
abv
in
this
series
the
poorer
the
quality
gets
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
bit
of
white
soapy
head
smell
of
pale
malt
and
a
small
malt
sweetness
in
the
taste
big
presence
of
euro
pale
malts
just
a
slight
sweetness
to
a
smooth
creamy
malt
finish
and
some
honey
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
between
a
very
euro
pale
malt
flavor
and
mild
herbal
hops
providing
little
bitterness
deceptive
in
its
strength
smooth
easy
drinking
and
rather
light
for
a
beer
9
5
abv
would
have
again
a
very
nice
place
to
start
enjoyed
this
beer
for
the
first
time
today
the
beer
had
a
pleasant
aroma
and
went
down
smoothly
the
abv
of
this
beer
at
9
5
is
better
than
average
for
what
can
be
found
locally
and
provides
a
nice
kick
even
after
one
serving
i
also
liked
the
extra
volume
of
beer
in
the
bottle
with
16
9
oz
instead
of
the
traditional
12
oz
that
you
get
with
most
beers
random
exotic
beer
at
my
little
corner
grocery
store
maine
lobster
must
have
been
the
owners
thinking
very
cherry
smell
and
almost
no
head
on
mine
alcohol
became
more
prominent
as
i
drank
more
and
the
last
sip
had
allot
of
alcohol
flavor
on
the
mouth
overall
very
sweet
and
malty
would
not
buy
again
as
i
prefer
hoppy
beers
but
glad
i
tried
it
1
bottle
gave
me
a
buzz
i
must
be
getting
old
i
dont
mind
boozy
brew
with
some
real
character
this
is
what
it
is
sweet
and
boozy
this
is
beer
to
get
wasted
on
i
cannot
see
this
with
food
nor
can
i
see
having
more
than
one
structure
and
quality
are
there
no
bitching
here
about
that
i
just
had
a
hard
time
getting
this
down
a
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
a
sweet
malty
bomb
of
pilsner
malt
honey
caramel
banana
and
spice
the
taste
is
malty
honey
sweet
fruity
a
bit
cloying
but
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
creamy
full
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
interesting
beer
almost
like
a
lighter
version
of
samiclaus
too
sweet
for
me
reveal
is
lobster
lovers
beer
from
rinkuskiai
in
lithuania
very
interesting
curve
ball
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
little
head
no
lacing
or
retention
the
aroma
has
notes
of
floral
hops
and
honey
the
taste
is
strong
with
honey
and
also
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
average
with
some
over
carbonation
overall
worth
a
try
it
may
be
your
thing
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
typical
yellow
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
on
it
lots
of
bubbles
rising
in
this
one
but
the
head
fades
away
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
at
all
the
smell
is
pretty
much
like
any
other
lager
out
there
the
taste
is
stronger
than
i
expected
a
decent
amount
of
flavors
in
there
but
nothing
that
really
makes
it
taste
good
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
the
abv
will
run
its
course
quickly
if
you
let
it
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
these
back
to
back
though
anyhoo
clear
dark
yellow
hue
with
no
head
or
bubbles
or
anything
nose
is
sweet
and
boozy
with
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
heavily
malty
and
sweet
and
has
all
the
subtlety
of
a
bazooka
the
lesson
here
is
clearly
to
get
blackout
drunk
as
quickly
as
possible
and
get
some
tender
stuff
from
a
ruddy
crustacean
the
texture
is
thin
and
the
finish
is
reasonably
clean
given
the
metric
not
something
to
hunt
for
but
if
you
find
it
feel
like
getting
shitefaced
and
are
in
the
mood
for
seafood
youre
in
luck
or
something
pours
a
clear
golden
honey
like
color
with
a
thin
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
an
unknown
sweetness
and
grains
the
taste
is
of
grains
with
a
slight
buttery
taste
at
the
end
the
nouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
it
is
very
nice
the
drinkability
is
ehhh
its
a
tough
drink
and
you
could
only
have
one
very
tasty
for
its
affordability
if
you
are
an
every
day
drinker
that
cant
afford
6
for
every
pint
size
bottle
you
purchase
then
take
advantage
of
this
bargain
from
eastern
europe
lithuanias
marketing
strategies
are
confusing
especially
with
werewolfs
slogan
and
this
unexplained
title
but
i
would
drink
this
everyday
d
moderately
high
cleaner
than
most
of
its
stateside
cousins
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
lacks
the
vegetal
grainy
off
notes
of
malt
liquors
id
buy
it
if
i
had
it
alailable

itd
be
great
to
get
a
load
of
these
in
a
bucket
of
ice
water
for
a
weekend
party
its
not
nuanced
and
it
wont
win
you
points
with
the
hop
snobs
but
ive
had
worse
brilliantly
clear
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
hints
of
cherry
white
chocolate
and
rose
water
in
the
nose
seems
the
alcohol
wants
to
take
over
even
in
a
subtle
manner
creamy
body
with
a
struggling
crispness
maltiness
is
pretty
sweet
with
some
vague
fruit
and
buttery
flavors
warmth
from
the
alcohol
is
of
a
clean
solvent
and
peppery
likeness
more
malt
sweetness
in
the
end
though
the
beer
does
move
forward
surprisingly
good
and
for
its
hefty
strength
it
does
not
stray
too
far
the
name
says
it
all
this
would
be
good
with
a
fresh
lobster
and
drawn
butter
d
this
isnt
terrible
but
not
something
i
would
drink
again
this
beer
was
surprisingly
better
than
i
anticipated
with
an
abv
of
95
i
expected
more
of
a
sweeter
taste
not
to
say
this
beer
is
not
sweet
but
it
is
decent
it
has
a
golden
rich
yellow
color
minimal
head
a
sweet
aroma
and
a
nice
slight
aftertaste
the
first
lithuanian
beer
i
have
ever
had
probably
will
not
be
the
last
while
it
doesnt
taste
like
lobster
it
certainly
is
rich
sweet
and
salty
like
a
seafood
hotpot
plus
i
swear
to
you
as
it
fully
warmed
to
room
temperature
the
initial
no
smell
at
all
blossomed
into
quite
the
pungeant
aroma
id
dare
say
if
you
shared
a
case
of
these
at
a
party
and
left
the
empties
sitting
around
until
morning
youd
really
need
to
air
out
your
home
this
beer
started
off
o
k
as
i
served
it
very
cold
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
well
blended
and
nothing
really
jumped
out
slight
citrus
and
sweet
flavors
however
the
finish
especially
as
it
grew
less
cold
became
more
and
more
offensive
highly
alcoholic
finish
however
i
wont
be
getting
another
the
taste
is
relatively
bland
theres
honeylike
sweetness
on
the
initial
sip
the
body
is
similar
to
skim
milknot
bad
the
carbonation
is
quite
high
very
little
bitterness
the
swallow
features
the
sourness
i
described
above
in
the
smell
the
aftertaste
is
mild
and
short
lived
interestingly
the
alcohol
is
quite
hidden
which
given
the
abv
percentage
and
the
style
is
stunning
love
the
label
i
think
my
first
lithuanian
beer
drinkability
another
drain
pour
for
the
night
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
even
if
i
was
wanting
to
catch
a
cheap
buzz
d
nothing
too
offensive
to
say
no
thats
why
it
gets
a
3
5
i
think
it
is
the
nasty
malty
flavor
not
balanced
by
decent
hops
that
makes
this
taste
so
bad
i
dont
get
the
almost
sexy
label
or
name
for
that
matter
either
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
at
first
but
seems
to
kick
with
a
strong
bitterness
before
long
not
my
favorite
import
by
far
and
a
beer
that
would
take
some
getting
used
to
d
easy
to
drink
because
there
isnt
very
much
going
on
here
i
think
i
will
pass
next
time
the
label
said
porter
but
its
actually
a
lager
it
pours
a
nice
clear
medium
amber
more
like
a
fine
ale
than
a
lager
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
typical
for
a
lager
flavor
is
rather
sweet
and
fruity
just
a
little
malty
texture
is
quite
smooth
and
hardly
fizzy
at
all
not
bad
overall
but
the
unchallenged
sweetness
was
a
little
much
after
a
bit
high
abv
is
hardly
even
noticeable
not
great
but
i
can
see
this
compliment
sweet

i
cant
really
stand
taking
a
big
gulp
its
offensive
medium
bodied
cloying
mess
with
residual
sugars
clouding
the
palate
its
so
bad
its
making
my
head
twitch
with
each
sip
drinkability
i
dont
think
so
drain
pour
but
it
was
worth
the
fun
edit
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
so
unpopular
normally
i
would
be
the
first
to
bash
import
lagers
but
to
me
this
one
is
a
winner
d
this
one
wasnt
for
me
too
boozy
and
sweet
i
wonder
what
the
hell
this
label
means
a
naked
chick
with
a
giant
lobster
on
her
back
i
wish
there
was
a
story
on
the
bottle
or
something
anyway
it
pours
out
a
cloudy
brass
color
and
has
a
dense
foamy
offwhite
head
smells
awful
i
swear
to
god
i
can
pick
up
a
hint
of
limburger
cheese
and
thats
about
the
last
odor
you
want
coming
from
your
beer
musty
like
a
urine
soaked
diaper
stench
exists
as
well
old
grain
just
awful
im
switching
from
a
1
5
to
a
1
0
for
the
smell
every
time
i
sniff
again
it
gets
worse
the
taste
is
ruined
by
the
smell
those
terrible
aromas
are
detected
in
the
flavor
also
but
theres
a
also
a
sweet
grainy
element
that
improves
this
whole
experience
ever
so
slightly
did
they
boil
some
lobster
then
use
the
same
water
for
the
brewing
process
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
the
only
things
going
for
this
disasterofabeer
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
im
choking
it
down
overall
not
something
i
enjoyed
but
something
im
glad
i
tried
i
was
disappointed
but
glad
at
the
same
time
that
there
was
no
lobster
flavors
in
this
one
a
strange
name
for
a
beer
but
honestly
how
else
would
this
beer
sell
great
marketing
technique
if
you
ask
me
a
pretty
bad
beer
doesnt
bring
much
to
the
table
besides
corn
like
sweetness
just
a
touch
of
grassiness
saves
this
from
being
truly
terrible
but
just
barely
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
as
well
lobster
lovers
certainly
does
not
taste
like
a
lager
euro
strong
or
any
other
but
its
not
bad
as
a
novelty
beer
i
enjoyed
it
i
just
dont
want
to
enjoy
it
that
often
over
a
year
later
112310
i
just
threw
up
in
my
mouth
a
little
while
thinking
about
this
beer
whew
theyre
very
proud
of
how
strong
it
is
it
has
a
big
hanging
tag
on
it
advertising
9
5
abv
good
for
them
so
if
this
is
the
lithuanian
equivalent
of
malt
liquor
its
good
in
the
sense
that
its
cheap
alcoholic
and
could
lead
to
questionable
desicion
making
at
social
gatherings
sucess
palate
is
sweet
with
fruity
adjunct
malt
and
a
very
slight
hoppy
bitterness
finish
leaves
a
lingering
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
warmth
a
mild
chalky
character
is
not
particularly
pleasant
while
the
alcohol
is
wellintegrated
this
is
not
exactly
a
beer
id
like
to
try
again
try
again
lithuania
drinkability
no
thanks
ill
choke
this
one
back
but
ill
not
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
seriously
pass
taste
is
thick
sweet
malt
some
caramel
grain
slight
skunky
aftertaste
no
taste
of
alcohol
with
a
9
5
ends
sweet
its
drinkable
i
cant
imagine
pounding
something
with
an
abv
this
high
over
and
over
again
but
its
certainly
not
a
beer
id
be
opposed
to
drinking
again
though
probably
not
very
often
drinkability
very
average
even
for
the
style
which
im
trying
to
rate
to
very
hard
here
just
not
a
terribly
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
strange
yeasty
off
note
and
a
little
too
much
alcohol
to
be
too
terribly
drinkable
i
cant
really
drink
much
of
this
beyond
the
sips
its
taking
me
to
review
this
beer
just
too
many
bad
flavors
at
work
you
can
pass
on
this
one
d
i
have
become
unhinged
by
this
beer
and
its
flavors
and
bizarre
presentationaesthetics
this
beer
has
a
type
of
stalwartness
with
a
large
dose
intractably
for
the
drinker
ok
another
lithuanian
oddity
found
in
topsham
maine
this
one
being
9
5
seriously
madness
out
of
the
bottle
this
euro
strong
lager
was
a
deep
gold
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
retention
was
decent
but
the
lacing
was
actually
quite
good
in
thin
sheets
the
aroma
was
of
musty
and
earthy
malt
with
some
sweetness
of
adjunct
grain
mash
and
a
light
spiciness
the
flavors
were
at
first
quite
spicy
and
rather
sweet
from
the
caramel
and
toffeelike
malt
along
with
some
artificial
tasting
sweetener
probably
being
used
to
cover
up
the
alcohol
the
middle
of
the
beer
was
grainy
and
after
a
while
i
began
to
taste
the
alc
in
that
part
the
finish
was
a
little
musty
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
a
bit
slick
the
carbonation
soft
and
the
body
medium
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
taste
but
it
was
almost
exactly
like
their
blue
label
only
twice
as
strong
if
youre
not
going
to
enjoy
the
flavors
you
might
as
well
enjoy
the
buzz
gotta
give
it
to
this
one
the
flavor
is
completely
enjoyable
ive
always
liked
this
idea
of
this
style
but
never
found
a
decent
representative
until
now
it
may
not
look
the
business
and
the
smell
is
dull
but
it
performs
where
it
matters
most
euro
strong
lagers
could
be
the
next
thing
for
u
s
brewers
to
mess
withid
love
to
see
it
the
strange
name
and
weirdly
sexydisturbing
label
probably
dont
do
it
justice
id
buy
it
again
as

for

bottle
from

beer
wine
wells
me
overall
better
than
expected
and
a
steal
at
2
50
im
relieved
theres
no
lobster
taste
d
there
were
four
reasons
i
picked
up
this
beer
the
country
the
price
the
huge
red
tag
that
said
9
5
abv
and
the
intriguing
arousing
and
yet
disturbing
label
as
someone
who
loves
both
lobster
and
the
female
form
i
cant
complain
about
the
bottle
graphics
while
strange
even
for
me
i
would
drink
more
of
this
beer
and
maybe
even
give
it
a
spin
with
lobster
i
tried
both
this
and
its
5
abv
brother
and
didnt
like
either
of
them
this
beer
was
a
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
it
had
an
aroma
of
grain
and
that
was
pretty
much
it
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
very
noticeable
but
despite
that
the
beer
was
pretty
bland
i
finished
this
500ml
bottle
and
couldnt
imagine
having
another
one
lobster
lovers
beer
has
one
of
the
strangest
names
and
one
of
the
strangest
labels
that
ive
ever
seen
even
though
the
contents
of
the
bottle
are
essentially
same
old
same
old
this
is
one
of
the
best
esls
going
that
still
doesnt
make
it
good
beer
this
is
not
very
good
for
a
9
5
but
you
can
t
tell
that
there
is
that
much
alcohol
in
this
stuff
and
a
note
to
all
of
you
with
a
glass
full
who
cant
properly
review
a
beer
drink
less
drink
better
think
more
please
this
beer
is
not
as
clean
as
the
last
one
i
had
from
this
brewery
though
both
are
extremely
similar
it
packs
a
punch
and
despite
the
subtle
flavor
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
it
gets
tough
to
finish
this
one
when
it
warms
up
drinkability
the
kind
of
beer
that
just
begs
to
be
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
wrapped
in
a
brown
paper
bag
overall
this
beer
comes
off
as
a
thinbodied
maibock
ultimately
this
beer
shows
what
happens
when
you
brew
a
maibock
without
a
nice
malty
backbone
and
in
the
process
shows
why
a
nice
malty
backbone
is
essential
to
a
maibock
still
its
not
a
horrible
beer
and
is
worth
it
for
the
bottle
alone

a

generally

with

the
booze
it
well

palatable
moderate
carbonation
mellows
the
whole
experience
out
a
bit
slick
and
a
bit
creamy
in
the
finish
extremely
well
crafted
i
am
impressed
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
pretty
typical
for
the
style
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
bright
yellow
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
retention
was
soso
and
the
lacing
light
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
adjunct
grains
and
a
strong
note
of
booze
the
flavors
were
similar
boozy
and
bold
with
lots
of
adjunct
grains
and
some
sweet
malt
that
tried
to
blanket
the
wallop
of
highimpact
alc
content
punchy
but
little
more
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
levels
about
right
perhaps
im
being
a
bit
strong
but
i
kept
thinking
euro
malt
liquor
for
eurotrash
types
pours
a
clear
deep
straw
yellow
little
head
and
little
retention
to
be
expected
with
a
beer
of
such
strength
aroma
of
toffee
apricot
alcohol
and
honeyed
breads
in
the
taste
buttery
toffee
mild
bitterness
spent
grains
light
malts
has
a
mildy
fruity
aspect
but
mainly
buttery
grainy
and
some
booze
not
at
all
unpleasant
which
is
quite
the
achievement
for
a
cheap
import
malt
liqour
style
lager
overall
not
a
bad
brew
that
does
its
job
a
lithuanian
brewer
worthy
of
respect
this
shit
is
awesome
i
expected
the
worst
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
dont
hesitate
to
try
this
i
paid
1
79
and
got
a
better
value
and
taste
and
buzz
than
any
kind
of
american
malt
liquor
great
beer
familiar
taste
that
i
cant
place
but
alcohol
is
wellhidden
topping
off
at
a
9
5abv
isnt
too
bad
of
a
eye
catcher
for
someone
who
likes
strong
beers
i
feel
that
for
the
strength
that
this
beer
packed
that
it
should
be
more
than
just
a
lager
the
flavors
are
a
little
too
boozie
and
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
balance
in
the
whole
thing
the
beer
is
a
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
the
taste
a
little
sour
kinda
strange
its
not
the
most
refeshing
brew
out
there
in
my
opinion
honey
golden
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
a
film
odd
cinnamon
and
fermented
apple
notes
in
the
aroma
wow
you
gotta
love
lithuanian
malt
liquor
to
enjoy
zhiguly
grande
because
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
a
high
octane
pale
lager
the
most
heating
and
famous
beer
of
beer
country
is
proudly
displayed
on
the
bottle
the
flavor
is
cidery
and
strong
with
plenty
of
fusel
alcohol
for
a
decent
burn
on
the
way
down
full
bodied
borderline
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
one
is
tough
to
drink
it
is
a
high
octane
brew
it
seems
like
a
strong
ale
in
a
lagers
suit
drinkability
highly
drinkable
for
its
abv
this
is
kind
of
the
night
train
of
beer
relatively
sweet
and
mostly
inoffensive
with
a
felonyinducing
alcohol
kick
am
i
weird
for
rating
this
above
average
overall
i
believe
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
any
other
reviewer
so
far
i
was
absolutely
surprised
and
it
was
truly
unexpected
would
recommend
to
anyone
picked
up
a
bottle
for
3
at
blanchards
in
allston
poured
into
a
wide
mouthed
lager
glass
yellowish
orange
in
color
moderate
carbonation
decent
sized
head
but
faded
quickly
small
amount
of
very
fine
particles
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
unusual
for
a
lager
smelled
a
lot
like
an
adjunct
lager
with
corn
noticeable
right
up
front
very
thick
mouthfeel
which
was
not
what
i
prefer
in
a
lager
a
few
things
make
this
beer
hard
to
drink
thick
aftertaste
the
oversized
bottle
and
uncharacteristicly
high
abv
do
not
let
this
beer
get
warm
as
it
does
not
improve
i
was
interested
in
trying
a
lager
hovering
near
10
abv
now
i
can
see
why
many
brewers
dont
attempt
this
it
just
turns
out
mediocre
i
really
dont
get
a
lot
of
flavor
here
but
what
flavor
i
do
get
is
very
grainy
and
just
a
little
caramel
malty
you
really
cant
taste
the
alcohol
here
so
this
must
be
a
pretty
good
beer
d
very
drinkable
for
9
4
but
i
think
one
will
do
the
trick
for
me
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
the
best
euro
strong
lager
i
have
had
very
drinkable
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
i
was
expecting
the
taste
of
a
macro
lager
with
a
shot
of
vodka
but
this
beer
is
actually
very
refreshing
and
refined
within
this
style
of
beers
in
ranks
near
the
top
for
me
while
not
quite
an
abject
failure
one
wonders
if
the
producers
of
this
beer
have
ever
actually
had
anything
approaching
a
doppelbock
before
while
i
can
find
one
or
two
things
to
enjoy
about
the
flavor
and
im
able
to
finish
the
bottle
only
had
one
or
two
drainpours
in
my
life
this
is
at
best
a
novelty
beer
and
a
worst
a
headache
in
a
bottle
avoid
this
beer
pours
really
nice
with
little
to
no
head
it
has
a
goldenhoney
color
the
initial
taste
is
wheat
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
theres
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
rated
so
low
its
very
smooth
and
delicious
i
recommend
it
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
the
brew
smells
like
breadygrainy
malt
sugar
and
booze
unfortunately
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
i
think
it
tastes
mostly
like
sugary
booze
with
some
grainy
malt
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
syrupy
and
coating
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
this
certainly
wasnt
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
lately
but
i
also
finished
the
bottle
without
a
problem
so
it
wasnt
exactly
awful
either
2
49
a
bottle
o
this
is
a
very
clean
inoffensive
high
alcohol
beer
it
does
not
have
any
particular
aspect
that
stands
out
but
it
is
pleasing
in
a
generic
highalcohol
way
despite
this
beer
clocking
in
at
12
abv
this
beer
wasnt
overly
boozy
sure
it
was
mostly
sweet
and
grainy
but
at
least
it
didnt
drink
like
rubbing
alcohol
if
you
want
a
cheap
beer
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
it
you
might
want
to
pick
up
this
beer
with
the
creepy
label
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
it
had
a
2
99
tag
around
the
500ml
bottle
i
should
have
known
the
taste
was
much
too
sweet
like
fake
candy
way
too
boozy
and
the
aftertaste
was
like
vomit
almost
zero
carbonation
and
a
very
strange
mirky
orange
color
i
drink
all
kinds
of
beer
but
this
went
down
the
drain
too
bad
good
god
this
beer
is
downright
awful
i
tried
i
really
did
i
muscled
down
about
half
the
glass
and
had
to
pour
the
rest
down
the
drain
it
got
far
worse
as
it
warmed
up
a
colossal
train
wreck
of
alcohol
adjunct
grains
malt
and
whatever
the
hell
else
is
in
this
beer
head
for
the
hills
this
is
the
worse
beer
ive
had
this
is
really
not
a
good
beer
ugh
review
from
92010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
nice
orange
amber
with
virtually
no
head
no
lacing
sour
grain
aroma
taste
is
light
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
a
kind
of
caramel
flavor
in
the
middle
but
it
is
overwhelmed
by
alcohol
and
an
acidic
estery
flavor
not
very
good
hopefully
wont
give
me
a
headache
avoid
this
one
overall
this
is
really
terrible
when
you
can
have
standard
like
ayinger
celeberator
or
weihenstephan
korbinian
why
would
you
even
want
this
troegenattor
please
o
after
reading
the
reviews
i
was
surprised
by
how
bland
this
beer
was
it
wasnt
offensive
but
it
wasnt
good
either
it
would
be
better
if
it
had
more
carbonation
i
have
another
bottle
which
of
course
i
will
drink
when
im
looking
for
a
cheap
drunk
however
if
youre
only
looking
for
a
cheap
drunk
off
of
beer
your
average
eurostrong
lager
is
a
better
option
or
just
get
some
black
boss
porter
or
zweic
porter
at
least
those
beers
have
some
character
to
it
dont
buy
this
buy
steel
reserve
or
some
other
malt
liqueur
that
does
a
better
job
than
this
impostor
i
purchased
this
bottle
lured
in
by
the
cool
optical
illusion
label
and
the
promise
of
12
alc
unfortunately
these
turned
out
to
be
the
only
highlights
of
the
experience
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
was
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
very
short
lived
head
of
tan
foam
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
booze
ethanol
and
some
skunked
malt
the
flavors
were
about
the
same
dominated
by
the
booze
and
ethanol
with
hints
of
something
fishy
and
an
acidic
bite
pure
unadulterated
garbage
the
mouthfeel
was
slick
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
average
not
worth
it
and
sadly
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
its
not
the
worst
thing
but
its
not
to
style
even
despite
the
alcohol
and
its
just
not
worth
drinking
but
if
thats
your
goal
talk
to
the
guy
who
reviewed
before
me
and
got
the
huge
bottle
for
only
2
99
overall
reprehensible
before
during
and
after
look
if
one
wishes
to
get
plastered
do
it
with
vodka
not
swill
like
this
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
very
interesting
taste
o
i
expected
something
pretty
potent
from
the
big
12
abv
warning
on
the
neck
and
the
picture
of
the
before
and
after
thing
on
the
front
and
i
was
right
however
i
hadnt
expected
the
pleasant
caramel
notes
that
help
make
it
drinkable
i
dont
like
to
throw
beer
out
but
this
was
complete
drainpour
overall
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
will
not
make
that
mistake
again
not
difficult
to
drink
and
kinda
tasty
just
nothing
impressive
and
memoriable
o
the
clean
lagered
beer
has
some
nice
malt
notes
with
some
ester
character
but
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
big
alcohol
that
soon
dominates
overall
i
like
it
better
than
the
scores
would
indicate
but
it
almost
seems
like
a
fruit
beer
instead
of
a
dopplebock
the
fruitiness
just
overwhelms
the
maltiness
that
i
associate
with
dopplebocks
overall
not
bad
nice
wheat
and
malt
flavors
chewy
malts
good
fruits
but
too
sweet
and
not
enough
carbonation
one
word
to
sum
this
one
up
booze
it
has
one
hell
of
an
alcohol
burn
but
what
flavor
there
is
other
than
alcohol
is
balanced
but
really
its
just
sweet
grain
alcohol
nothing
but
a
buzz
in
a
bottle
very
cool
bottle
the
whole
reason
i
bought
it
very
thin
head
which
immediately
dissipated
clear
with
bubbles
rising
smell
is
of
rich
full
caramel
malt
and
well
straw
actually
the
taste
is
of
fruity
esters
in
a
rich
caramel
brew
alcohol
flavor
is
not
prevalent
despite
12abv
mouthfeel
is
cheap
and
expected
2
75
per
16
9oz
bottle
overall
definitely
worth
the
experience
and
a
hella
cool
bottle
d
i
finished
the
pint
but
it
was
a
lot
of
alcohol
will
not
be
having
again
what
a
surprise
this
tasted
boosey
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
think
being
12
very
refreshing
for
such
a
powerful
brew
a
nice
profile
of
caramel
and
skunky
hops
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
terrible
but
for
less
than
3
i
was
very
happy
it
went
down
way
too
fast
for
how
strong
it
was
probably
why
im
feeling
it
so
much
today
will
seek
out
more
pours
a
one
threefinger
white
head
that
vanishes
leaving
no
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
thinner
than
i
expected
light
alcohol
and
caramel
nose
flavor
has
hints
of
alcohol
caramel
hops
are
in
background
not
cloying
not
as
bad
as
the
ratings
suggest
4
50
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
i
was
a
little
scared
of
this
beer
i
thought
it
would
be
a
hot
adjunct
laden
mess
but
its
actually
quite
tasty
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
try
it
out
its
worth
the
3
for
sure
overall
a
below
average
beer
try
it
for
the
hell
of
it
but
you
wont
be
missing
anything
if
you
skip
it
verdict
weird
but
wellpriced
and
fun
the
main
selling
point
of
this
brew
was
the
abv
displayed
in
huge
lettering
on
a
tag
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
that
and
an
increasing
interest
in
bocks
i
wasnt
pleased
but
i
have
had
worse
so
i
cant
fail
beforeafter
thankfully
taste
and
feel
are
a
lot
better
it
is
malty
and
overall
like
the
aroma
but
more
pleasant
it
has
a
spiceysweet
faintly
meaty
raisiny
character
with
a
hint
of
dough
and
rather
like
cheap
fortified
wine
with
a
hint
of
basic
blended
american
whisky
it
is
onedimensional
devoid
of
complexity
but
nevertheless
fairly
pleasant
alcohol
is
evident
but
amazingly
smooth
with
a
strong
warming
quality
and
not
rough
or
unpleasant
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
all
of
this
and
for
the
high
abv
but
rather
boring
poured
with
a
small
short
lived
off
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
i
got
a
whiff
of
the
malt
aroma
also
has
lots
of
grain
caramel
and
circus
peanuts
flavors
about
the
same
and
very
sweet
body
is
like
id
expect
from
a
beer
this
sweet
full
and
thankfully
theres
enough
carbonation
to
cut
through
it
finish
is
like
flavor
and
has
some
length
probably
wont
finish
it
the
mouthfeel
was
very
sharp
cant
believe
this
is
a
bock
it
bears
no
resemblence
to
a
bock
d
i
dont
think
ill
have
another
of
these
anytime
soon
drinkability
a
thumbsup
for
this
lithuanian
surprise
pretty
nice
value
too
at
just
3
a
halfliter
ill
have
to
set
one
of
these
down
for
posterity
to
see
how
it
ages
san
miguel
tries
to
give
some
strength
to
his
beer
and
even
better
than
normal
beer
fails
to
reach
make
a
decent
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
you
can
find
in
spain
there
are
only
half
a
dozen
iberian
beers
that
really
say
something
and
this
is
one
of
them
unfortunately
i
dont
think
that
you
can
find
this
outside
of
spain
to
easily
its
a
really
decent
beer
and
only
costs
about
a
1

a

i
found
it
somewhat

cut

but
definitely
worth
a
try
bronze
mouth
when
you
feel
a
light
syrup
not
really
pleasant
because
too
fast
disgusting
it
seems
that
it
is
a
combination
of
three
hops
and
a
grape
aged
in
cellars
faced
with
such
a
conclusion
which
is
undergoing
a
presence
in
more
alcohol
too
strong
to
preserve
the
balance
of
the
beer
it
is
reasonable
to
ask
whether
such
a
hack
was
required
conclusion
do
not
drink
san
miguel
no
matter
its
name
when
you
go

o
nothing
really

lager
which
will
probably
be
good
when
you
feel
thirsty
easy
drinking
and
nice
foreign
brew
thats
a
fun
talking
point
makes
me
want
to
travel
lithuania
to
get
more
a
friend
recently
gave
me
some
lithuanian
beers
to
try
and
this
was
the
second
one
i
tried
poured
into
a
tall
pilsener
glass
its
a
brown
bottle
but
pours
with
a
very
pale
yellow
color
for
a
7
3
beer
lots
of
champagnelike
carbonation
decent
sized
head
and
moderate
amounts
of
lacing
smell
was
boozy
taste
was
like
a
macro
lager
with
lots
of
corn
and
malt
there
was
a
lot
more
alcohol
ester
up
front
on
this
one
also
this
beer
was
sticky
sweet
on
the
palate
the
combination
of
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
were
not
overly
pleasurable
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
would
not
opt
for
a
second
bottle
in
a
row
i
preferred
the
kalnapilis
grand
over
this
one
on
a
side
note
i
wrote
this
review
while
having
a
bottle
of
it
right
next
to
me
just
a
few
sips
left
so
all
the
experiences
are
refreshed
actually
they
are
just
as
i
remember
them
also
i
want
to
say
that
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
so
i
cant
confirm
what
it
looks
like
poured
overall
i
find
it
interesting
this
beer
won
a
gold
medal
in
the
world
beer
cup
according
to
the
bottle
its
not
completely
terrible
but
its
not
so
good
either
it
was
cheap
though
finishable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
id
honestly
take
a
marcolager
over
this
not
recommended
at
first
i
was
about
ready
to
write
this
one
off
but
after
a
few
more
sips
i
found
myself
liking
it
a
bit
more
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
medium
head
that
quickly
subsides
to
a
thin
cover
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
at
first
is
like
aroma
but
then
gives
way
to
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
end
mouth
is
decent
and
so
is
carbonation
finsih
is
on
the
short
side
clean
and
fair
i
could
drink
a
few
more
with
no
problems
if
there
wasnt
something
with
a
little
more
character
available
a
good
beer
as
long
as
you
dont
get
offended
by
style
definitions
d
it
would
make
a
lovely
gift
to
your
alcoholic
uncle
if
you
can
wrest
that
bottle
of
steel
reserve
from
his
soused
clutches
pours
out
in
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
has
a
slight
tin
taste
and
a
mild
but
lingering
after
taste
i
chose
this
beer
because
i
enjoy
lagers
and
have
not
had
a
lithuanian
was
not
impressed
but
it
was
cold
and
crisp
could
use
a
more
difinitive
taste
that
doesnt
hang
around
as
long
light
bodied
beer
that
taste
cheap
im
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
but
it
is
cold
and
does
quench
my
thirst
although
it
leaves
some
unpleasant
aftertaste
there
is
nothing
special
in
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
d
if
i
stuck
with
this
beer
all
night
long
id
suffer
through
the
worst
hangover
in
the
history
of
mankind
tomorrow
ill
be
thankful
that
this
is
my
only
bottle
and
ill
pray
that
my
lithuanian
brothers
embrace
the
craft
movement
this
is
simply
a
terrible
terrible
beer
d
this
beer
started
out
ok
the
odd
metal
and
veggie
flavors
arent
that
present
while
this
beer
is
cold
as
it
warms
however
the
beer
becomes
rather
unpleasant
its
not
wince
inducing
but
its
still
not
enjoyable
in
the
end
this
is
another
mediocre
euro
lager
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
beer
thats
7

abv
hopefully
lithuania
keeps
the
good
stuff
to
themselves
because
this
export
is
mediocre
at
best
d
average
drinkability
and
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
out
of
lithuania
though
wouldnt
rush
out
and
buy
a
sixer
won
gold
in
the
world
beer
cup
2004
kalnapilis
original
is
a
better
beer
but
this
one
is
worth
at
least
a
try
notes
this
is
a
very
basic
or
average
strong
euro
lager
d
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
sure
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
but
i
would
totally
house
this
during
an
open
bar
much
better
options
out
there
eastern
european
malt
liquor
its
a
wonderful
thing
d
an
average
strong
euro
lager
not
bad
not
good
i
would
probably
choose
to
not
drink
this
again

into

rest
of
appearance
similar
to
other
us
macrobrews
large
white
bubbles
make
up
a

that
quickly
dissipates
smell
is
nonspecific
malty
smell
with
a
harsh
undertone
taste
follows
smell
in
this
one
and
flavor
is
malty
with
a
background
bitterness
that
hangs
around
too
long
on
the
palate
and
alcohol
seems
to
come
through
too
much
due
to
lack
of
competing
flavors
with
the
amount
of
mediumlow
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
flavor
i
agree
with
past
reviews
that
this
should
be
served
cold
overall
this
beer
drinks
easily
cold
and
gives
you
more
ounce
per
ounce
alcohol
but
the
bland
malty
flavor
and
bitter
aftertaste
will
not
have
me
returning
kalnapilis

is
roughly
equivalent
to
a
better
than
average
american
malt
liquor
in
terms
of
quality
and
drinkability
even
though
ill
never
be
a
fan
of
this
style
i
can
see
how
lithuanians
looking
to
get
blitzed
might
find
this
to
be
a
better
alcohol
delivery
system
than
most
kalnapilis

pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
very
minimal
white
head
from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
the
aroma
is
inoffensive
a
bit
malty
id
say
the
taste
is
on
the
malty
side
alcohol
is
strongly
noticeable
this
is
on
par
with
an
american
malt
liquor
there
really
is
no
reason
to
recommend
this
beer
your
money
would
be
better
spent
elsewhere
average
at
best
honestly
this
is
about
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
drinkable
but
not
real
good
pours
a
medium
golden
straw
with
medocire
bubbling
and
a
subpar
head
the
aroma
is
like
adjuncty
corn
on
the
cob
with
some
hints
of
rice
and
some
pale
malts
a
little
earthy
overall
the
flavor
was
mostly
pale
malt
sunflower
adjuncts
and
alcohol
not
brow
furrowing
at
all
just
pretty
run
of
the
mill
i
dont
really
know
my
euro
strong
lagers
too
well
i
can
only
hope
the
others
are
better
than
this
offering
from
our
lithuanian
friends
sticky
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
i
drank
just
enough
about
6oz
to
do
this
review
and
now
i
will
dump
the
rest
if
i
were
drunk
and
needed
to
get
drunker
this
may
work
otherwise
no
thanks
kalnapilis
actually
drinks
okay
despite
all
that
worse
beers
out
there
keep
this
ice
cold
it
will
hold
up
for
a
few
better
cheap
baltic
beers
out
there
but
who
knows
if
you
get
this
fresher
like
globetrotter
might
be
a
different
animal
just
didnt
migrae
to
co
very
well
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
light
beer
it
really
lacks
good
flavors
of
malt
and
hops
there
is
no
character
or
depth
to
this
beer
the
label
says
it
is
a
2004
world
beer
cup
gold
mentalist
but
i
cant
get
excited
about
any
of
the
flavors
or
more
specific
the
lack
of
flavor
sinkability

i
hate
to
pour
the
2004
world
beer
cup
gold
award
winner
down
the
pipes
but
i
just
couldnt
finish
it
pours
an
attractive
clear
deep
coppertinted
gold
under
a
one
finger
white
head
with
very
good
retention
and
some
pretty
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
all
sweet
barley
the
mouth
is
mediumbodied
and
quite
prickly
the
tongue
is
greeted
by
a
good
smooth
malt
opening
followed
by
a
pleasant
if
slightly
metallic
hoppy
bite
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
finish
emphasizes
the
bitter
which
has
already
mellowed
considerably
the
aftertaste
consists
of
a
slight
bite
at
the
back
of
the
jowls
not
harsh
not
overly
alcoholic
not
sour
this
is
a
very
good
rendition
of
the
style
overall
might
as
well
drink
a
steel
reserve
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
fruits
some
alcohol
taste
is
dominated
by
alcohol
a
bit
of
grains
and
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
will
at
least
give
you
a
buzz
with
just
one
not
the
best
beer
ever
but
decent
i
really
dont
know
why
it
got
so
many
bad
reviews
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
much
better
than
a
d
or
f
whew
those
poor
poor
maltanian
bastards
this
stuff
is
wicked
bad
imagine
a
40
oz
of
malt
liquor
boiled
down
to
about
12
oz
becoming
the
consistency
of
thin
syrup
and
adding
3
ounces
of
grain
alcohol
that
is
pretty
much
what
this
tastes
like
sweetness
is
ridiculously
cloying
and
the
beer
is
viscous
as
hell
feeling
in
the
mouth
avoid
at
all
costs
unless
you
are
a
glutton
for
punishment
am
i
going
to
finish
this
bitch
maybe
but
only
because
i
had
to
buy
two
of
these
mfers
cause
the
first
one
exploded
in
my
freezer
i
would
not
drink
another
one
unless
someone
paid
me
to
im
not
really
familiar
with
the
euro
strong
lager
style
so
im
not
sure
if
its
an
acquired
taste
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
acquiring
it
any
time
soon
cisk
xs
is
my
second
maltese
beer
and
is
my
second
lousy
maltese
beer
on
the
positive
side
after
two
or
three
bottles
the
rest
should
go
down
pretty
easily
if
you
decide
to
take
the
plunge
and
buy
a
bottle
not
recommended
dont
forget
the
brown
paper
bag
i
dont
know
what
beer
the
rest
of
yall
reviewed
but
this
is
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
pretty
bad
too
with
medium
body
alcohol
burn
and
too
much
carbonation
drinkability
is
poor
i
wouldnt
be
looking
for
another
even
if
it
was
free
poured
into
an
american
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
very
pale
quite
clear
strawgold
color
with
a
substantial
2finger
head
on
top
the
nose
is
quite
grainy
with
a
little
hint
of
solvent
ugh
an
extremely
sweet
nearly
cloyingly
sweet
beer
with
no
hint
of
anything
hoppy
together
with
medicinal
very
harsh
alcohol
thinbodied
and
watery
and
nearly
undrinkable
i
couldnt
finish
a
single
glassill
have
to
find
someone
to
give
this
away
to
i
picked
up
this
beer
a
few
days
ago
out
of
curiosity
i
was
told
it
was
bad
its
actually
worse
than
i
expected
i
cant
pick
out
a
flaw
here
or
there
to
pick
on
it
needs
so
much
work
all
across
the
board
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
well
maybe
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
from
malta
but
theres
got
to
be
a
better
one
than
this
right
d
drinkability
was
not
good
as
to
be
expected
didnt
really
care
to
finish
this
one
and
was
a
struggle
to
justify
why
a
huge
disappointment
when
compared
to
its
original
lager
which
was
more
hoppy
grainy
and
flavorful
this
one
came
off
as
cheap
cornmalt
liquor
and
comes
with
a
non
recommend
and
a
cheers
to
their
original
lager
d
drinkability
is
really
not
looking
good
for
this
brew
too
sweet
and
too
hot
it
would
be
best
to
just
start
all
over
with
this
brew
take
it
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
start
tweaking
until
something
a
little
better
wass
produced
not
recommended
at
all
appearance
was
flat
with
very
little
lace
to
the
glass
there
wasnt
much
of
a
smell
but
if
i
had
to
describe
it
i
would
say
rubbing
alcohol
not
a
smooth
tasting
brew
at
all
mouth
feel
was
about
average
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
wish
i
could
give
it
a
zero
in
all
categories
except
appearance
because
it
was
truly
the
most
offensive
liquid
i
have
ever
drank
avoid
at
all
costs
sampled
side
by
side
with
regular
cisk
lager
a
very
light
yellowgolden
colored
beer
with
a
small
white
colored
head
nearly
identical
in
appearance
to
the
regular
cisk
lager
nose
has
more
complexity
than
the
regular
cisk
with
similar
notes
as
the
regular
cisk
but
also
some
light
notes
of
caramel
and
fruit
flavor
isnt
enjoyable
but
has
some
nice
malt
elements
of
caramel
and
toffee
suprisingly
decent
still
not
drinkable
for
me
but
its
an
ok
beer
if
i
were
desperate
i
could
drink
this
spesh
aint
that
big
on
taste
ive
had
many
beers
across
the
world
but
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
theres
no
beer
in
america
that
can
even
compare
or
come
close
strong
alcohol
content
and
a
sweet
taste
enjoyed
this
beverage
at
many
establishments
in
legnica
poland
does
anyone
know
where
i
can
order
this
from
in
the
u
s
overall
after
the
initial
bad
smell
this
is
not
that
bad
for
what
it
offers
i
am
now
already
down
to
half
the
glass
drinking
it
rather
quickly
and
i
already
find
it
better
than
when
i
opened
the
can
either
it
gets
better
once
it
warms
up
which
i
doubt
or
the
7
abv
has
gotten
me
d
suprisingly
high
in
alcohol
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
o
a
nice
flowery
beer
a
bit
sweet
and
not
to
bitter
bham
uk
march
2011
a
pleasant
one
compared
to
others
in
the
genre
would
definetly
drink
it
again
but
i
have
other
preferences
in
this
bracket
this
beer
was
fairly
bland
and
slightly
watery
no
real
aroma
i
consider
7
abv
quite
strong
but
the
beer
hides
this
very
well
i
was
expecting
a
drain
cleaner
for
taste
but
its
a
very
drinkable
lager
just
dont
expect
too
much
tastehopsmalt
etc
blandish
macro
was
a
good
price
would
buy
again
this
beer
had
been
reduced
to
1
as
it
was
slightly
over
its
bbe
date
i
bought
the
last
bottle
and
this
will
be
my
last
bottle
of
this
beer
debowe
mocne
could
be
even
gassier
than
san
miguel
and
that
is
some
statement
from
me
as
i
thought
nothing
could
be
as
bad
as
that
which
is
why
i
have
only
given
it
1
for
drinkability
the
sun
obviuosly
helped
to
mellow
my
thoughts
and
i
needed
a
refreshing
drink
which
this
beer
gave
me
but
i
think
my
first
review
is
now
somewhat
unfair
on
this
above
average
product
d
a
gift
from
my
polish
boss
while
this
goes
down
quite
easy
for
a
mocne
its
not
a
very
pleasant
experience
feels
rather
unbalanced
pleasant
taste
kind
of
malty
and
bready
with
some
light
fruity
notes
quite
pleasing
for
a
strong
lager
lacking
the
usual
sweet
nasty
syruppy
taste
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
beer
reminds
me
of
malt
liquor
from
the
states
and
its
for
the
same
purpose
i
am
disappointed
and
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
7
beer
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
the
head
dissipated
but
left
some
mild
lacing
mellow
aromas
of
malt
metallic
grain
and
mild
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
bitter
malt
light
hops
with
a
fruity
quality
some
light
spice
notes
in
there
too
pleasant
carbonation
a
nice
and
drinkable
lager
went
well
with
some
polish
meats
and
cheese
at
a
picnic
in
warsaw
certainly
a
pick
over
the
zywiec
lager
everyone
was
drinking
overall
an
ok
beer
nothing
groundbreaking
better
than
the
initial
aroma
indicated
worth
a
try
500
ml
can
bought
in
poland
golden
to
amber
colour
large
head
fairly
strong
sweetish
musty
and
fruity
aroma
flavour
is
fairly
malty
and
sweet
with
evident
alcoholic
notes
partially
balanced
by
tolerable
hops
i
had
it
on
its
own
at
cellar
temperature
would
probably
prefer
it
cold
with
a
solid
polish
meal
im
not
about
to
pick
this
over
a
baltic
porter
but
its
way
ahead
of
some
of
those
awful
pale
lagers
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
actually
not
too
bad
for
a
malt
liquor
nevertheless
it
is
sweet
and
it
misses
body
and
hops
to
help
to
counterbalance
its
alcohol
o
very
nice
malt
forward
beer
poring
this
out
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
clear
ruby
brown
beer
with
some
lacing
and
a
white
small
head
that
was
produced
from
what
looks
like
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
dominated
by
malts
bready
nutty
some
sweetness
little
bit
of
yeast
esters
and
some
earthy
tones
aroma
is
not
overly
complex
or
strong
but
still
is
nice
and
pleasant
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
malt
forward
dominate
flavor
but
it
contains
more
complexity
with
dark
fruits
raisins
breadiness
and
esters
mouth
is
full
bodied
effervescent
pillowy
soft
and
very
appealing
this
is
a
great
euro
strong
lager
and
probably
the
first
i
have
had
in
this
style
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
your
strong
beer
more
on
the
malty
side
that
kinda
has
a
quad
similarity
cheers
very
nice
malty
brew
dark
amber
color
tingly
feel
good
if
you
are
also
into
triples
and
the
like
nice
brown
tone
with
white
head
that
dissipated
in
a
few
minutes
malt
forward
with
a
little
alcohol
heat
but
not
in
a
bad
way
overall
a
clean
beer
but
nothing
really
complex
that
would
make
me
look
for
it
i
like
drier
beers
and
am
frequently
disappointed
by
many
beers
of
this
type
because
of
the
overly
sweet
notes
that
coat
the
mouth
and
linger
without
any
balance
however
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
pretty
good
its
not
my
first
choice
on
the
shelf
but
i
could
drink
it
again
attractive
dark
red
amber
with
a
modest
foam
so
sweet
with
caramel
but
then
the
bitter
aftertaste
emerges
this
is
one
of
the
classic
alcoholic
malt
depth
charges
that
lagunitas
used
to
be
known
for
and
it
goes
down
nicely
like
a
wet
dream
of
a
malt
liquor
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
litickers
liquor
in
san
diego
nice
sour
smell
very
large
creamy
head
nice
sour
flavor
with
hints
of
lemon
and
chocolate
very
strong
abv
wow
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
well
nice
hopping
to
balance
the
superb
malts
a
session
beer
for
the
hard
drinking
types
love
this
brewery
if
youre
ever
in
the
bay
area
this
is
a
fun
brewery
to
check
out
with
a
cool
tour
and
cool
atmosphere
this
isnt
my
favored
beer
from
this
brewery
but
it
was
definitely
refreshing
if
you
like
lighter
beers
this
ones
probably
for
you
taste
is
not
too
overpowering
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
poured
into
tulip
pours
dark
copper
with
a
reddish
hue
thin
off
white
head
reduces
to
an
extremely

heavy
alcohol

hints

heavy

the
point

you
would
think
its

mouthfeel
is
a

thin

the
booze
theres
lots
of
sweetness
with
a
slight

aftertaste
described
as
a
euro
strong
ale
but
tastes
a
whole
lot
like
a
barleywine
thats
not
ready
yet
if
you
have
this
or
buy
this
in
2014
do
yourself
a
favor
and
throw
it
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
two
d
a
7
0
abv
that
drinks
more
like
a
coors
light
not
much
body
wise
but
ok
flavor
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
good
for
a
cheap
buzz
but
not
much
appreciation
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
cloudy
vanishing
head
aroma
is
strong
overly
malted
dried
fruit
characters
what
else
to
expect
from
a
strong
euro
this
brew
pulls
off
the
label
better
than
others
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
nicely
carbonated
and
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
is
masked
very
well
by
a
dry
slightly
hopped
finish
you
cant
really
knock
it
when
our
strong
macro
brews
can
be
used
to
degrease
a
block
looks
pretty
average
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
plain
sweet
and
grainy
hints
of
malts
are
barely
there
taste
is
rye
grains
and
some
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
mustiness
i
guess
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
all
the
flavors
are
concurrent
without
meshing
not
bad
but
not
too
great
either
mouthfeel
is
foamy
yet
thin
drinkability
is
ok
overall
just
a
plainjane
kind
of
beer
a
worthwhile
experience
and
more
complex
than
i
anticipated
purchasesd
at
gomers
in
parkville
got
it
cheap
for
a
buck
79
so
figured
what
the
heck
a
1
pt
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
clear
straw
colored
massive
white
head
i
had
to
take
a
bite
out
of
it
so
as
not
to
overflow
after
a
minute
or
so
it
receeded
to
nothing
no
lace
to
speak
of
smell
is
pretty
weak
what
there
is
is
a
bit
spicy
and
peppery
with
some
dark
cereal
notes
rye
maybe
taste
is
suprisingly
smokey
and
spicy
it
is
medium
bodied
but
very
fizzy
it
borders
on
overcarbonated
but
its
no
bothering
me
that
much
finishes
pretty
clean
just
a
little
smokey
after
taste
pretty
drinkable
ill
go
for
this
again
if
im
going
cheap
poured
a
light
peeyellow
color
with
a
small
frothy
white
and
rapidly
diminishing
head
the
aroma
is
slight
moderate
notes
of
grain
and
light
hoppy
notes
of
straw
the
flavor
was
unremarkable
lightly
bittersweet
up
front
with
an
averagelength
lightly
bitter
finish
the
body
was
light
the
texture
was
watery
and
the
carbonation
was
fizzy
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
and
provides
a
surprising
warmth
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
the
beer
is
okay
for
what
it
is
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
and
dont
really
recommend
it
the
finish
is
not
appealing
and
overall
the
beer
is
rather
empty
from
start
to
finish
rycerskie
is
an
interesting
brew
and
is
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
endless
parade
of
epls
it
isnt
a
standout
but
as
a
lover
of
big
beer
i
approve
of
the
effort
to
crank
up
the
volume
and
add
a
little
life
to
the
euro
lager
party
nice
head
with
golden
yellow
color
smell
is
some
malt
but
with
an
odd
fishy
quality
taste
is
mainly
malty
with
some
oiliness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
some
catching
in
the
back
of
the
throat
i
poured
it
out
after
a
few
gulps
drinkability
lacking
drinkability

this
boozy
beer
goes
down
a
bit
rough
but
theres
nothing
offensive
to
it
very
nice
long
lasting
head
that
sat
on
a
nice
golden
beer
flavor
lasted
throughout
without
being
overwhelming
in
any
one
flavor
hard
to
find
here
locally
but
will
grab
it
again
sometime
recommend
picking
up
2
instead
of
just
one

not

low

seeps
through
and
is
balanced
in
the
mix
of
this
strong

lager
mouthfeel
lighter
bodied
even
carbonation
a
well
abled
brew
in
satisfying
the
senses
on
all
regards
drinkability
impressed
by
this
offering
why
honestly
i
wasnt
expecting
much
instead
of
a
run
of
the
mill
mass
produced
euro
swill
i
got
a
well
made
strong
lager
that
was
tasty
and
drinkable
with
a
nice
mix
of
flavor
rycerskie
i
feel
noble
now
poured
out
a
light
honeygold
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
smell
consisted
of
malts
mostly
but
it
had
a
sweet
hint
to
it
as
well
some
caramel
or
butterscotch
as
well
cant
be
sure
taste
semisweet
grainy
malty
with
some
slight
hops
at
the
end
it
has
a
good
body
to
it
creamy
and
full
bodied
i
wished
it
had
just
a
tad
more
carbonation
to
it
but
thats
ok
one
of
the
better
polish
beers
i
think
overall
honestly
this
was
a
very
nice
surprise
much
better
than
i
anticipated
and
not
all
that
bad
actually
fruity
and
refreshing
the
only
complaint
is
that
the
grainy
feel
and
sweet
malts
can
be
a
little
much
at
times
worth
a
try
though
nice
polish
import
and
one
of
my
half
liter
for
little
more
than
a
buck
beers
a
fairly
typical
tasting
eastern
european
lager
nice
rich
taste
very
malty
with
a
mild
kick
of
skunk
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
hazy
golden
color
not
a
lot

fairly
typical
tasting
beer
not
bad
for
the
price
clear
golden
moderately
carbonated
with
a
lively
white
head
that
remained
to
a
degree
aroma
was
quite
strong
yeasty
pungent
malt
and
alcohol
coming
at
my
nostrils
the
flavour
was
much
more
subtle
a
wellbalanced
mix
of
malt
and
hops
providing
a
clean
taste
a
bit
of
grainy
alcohol
warmth
comes
through
too
particularly
after
the
other
aspects
had
faded
not
the
most
assertive
beer
in
the
world
but
not
bland
either
theres
plenty
of
flavour
to
make
this
a
quality
brew
and
it
just
proves
that
inexpensive
beer
is
not
necessarily
bad
at
least
if
it
hails
from
eastern
europe
orangish
in
color
that
produces
a
big
white
head
smells
fruity
and
hopped
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
tastes
sharp
and
dry
nice
hops
finish
the
alcohol
goes
very
well
with
this
beer
this
is
the
first
polish
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
at
all
appears
an
orange
hazy
moderatelycarbonated
liquid
with
a
stable
and
brilliantly
white
head
it
presents
a
pleasing
floral
hop
aroma
thats
more
aggressive
than
other
polish
lagers
that
ive
sampled
good
balance
with
a
malty
foretaste
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
aroma
but
fits
very
nicely
in
the
overall
taste
creamy
moderatelyfull
mouthfeel
dryish
finish
this
is
a
solidly
good
beer
a
little
more
intensity
and
it
would
have
been
downright
wonderful
taste
was
a
little
sweet
and
i
detected
a
hint
of
citrus
in
there
somewhere
the
mouthfeel
clearly
had
a
lot
of
body
which
is
becasue
of
of
of
the
malty
sweetness
the
body
and
sweetness
masked
much
of
the
alcohol
which
means
that
it
is
a
pilsner
for
a
short
night
not
a
session
this
is
a
top
lager
and
shows
that
the
eastern
europeans
are
emerging
as
strong
brewers
of
the
style
500
ml
bottle
fresh
from
the
importer
a
crystalclear
golden
body
is
topped
by
a
pillowy
white
head
that
holds
well
buoyed
by
hundreds
of
fastrising
standardsized
bubbles
and
initially
leaves
solid
sheets
of
lace
the
lacing
loosens
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
but
it
remains
until
the
end
very
nice
the
clean
fresh
aroma
welcomes
you
with
a
gently
sweet
and
mildly
grainy
husky
malt
thats
subtly
touched
by
hops
the
body
is
full
and
its
creamy
in
the
mouth
due
to
its
soft
gently
effervescent
carbonation
the
flavor
is
just
as
clean
as
the
aroma
and
exactly
as
might
be
expected
with
a
lightly
sweet
malt
thats
touched
by
floral
and
softly
grassy
hops
some
fruitiness
resides
in
there
as
well
and
its
wellbalanced
with
the
bitterness
doing
just
enough
to
keep
the
malt
from
becoming
more
than
lightly
sweet
theres
obviously
a
lot
of
adjunct
used
as
its
grainy
character
is
limited
but
the
7
alcohol
by
volume
is
really
well
hidden
although
it
does
become
more
noticeable
as
you
progress
through
the
pint
it
finishes
with
a
wash
of
sweetish
malt
in
the
mouth
that
fades
readily
as
the
alcohol
dries
things
up
clean
fresh
soft
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
never
overdone
a
pleasant
surprise
one
of
the

i
was
pretty
far
off
this
is

an
imperial
dark
lager
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
from
wolverine
state
brewing
co
so
yeah
wow
knowing
what
this
is
as
im
drinking
it
maybe
i
can
get
bourbon
in
place
of
the
fruitymaple
sweetness
i
get
essentially
zero
vanilla
though
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
infection
but
maybe
theres
some
acetaldedehyde
involved
here
that
led
me
to
green
apples
ive
had
a
few
bourbon
barrelaged
lagers
from
jacks
abby
but
this
doesnt
resemble
any
of
them
and
one
was
a
barrelaged
doppelbock
which
is
close
enough
to
this
style
maybe
its
just
really
heavy
on
the
fusel
alcohols
and
not
very
good
thanks
for
the
interesting
beer
abraxel
mouthfeel
is
fine
maybe
a
bit
thin
o
i
like
this
beer
im
a
fan
its
not
the
most
jam
packed
full
of
crazy
type
beer
but
it
has
great
barrel
flavor
and
its
smooth
id
drink
this
again
no
problem
at
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
overly
packed
with
packed
a
ton
of
different
flavors
but
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
ba
beer
id
grab
one
of
these
solid
stuff
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
from
bottle
to
shaker
glass
at
polonia
in
hamtramck

little

is

and

taste
is

is
crisp
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
much
fuller
than
i
expected
not
something
id
seek
out
but
not
gonna
pass
it
up
if
i
see
it
out
and
about
alcohol
on
label
says
6

not
the
7
00
listed
in
the
description
purchased
at
a
local
polish
deli
color
is
a
dark
amber
head
disappears
fairly
quickly
taste
is
lackluster
a
bit
watery
and
weak
and
not
and
rather
fizzy
not
at
all
like
the
back
label
description
of
intense
rich
full
bodied
taste
perhaps
it
suffered
from
being
on
the
patio
during
a
freezing
night
or
two
but
judging
by
other
ratings
here
perhaps
not
drinkable
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
enjoy
rich
taste
malty
caracter
full
body
tasty
strong
balanced
sizeable
and
generally
satisfying
overall
hmm
i
think
the
bottle
says
it
best
strong
beer
unique
taste
very
interesting
and
no
alcohol
whack
for
being
7
i
think
worth
another
go
specifically
as
it
is
far
cheaper
than
most
beers
of
this
abv
it
is
a
reasonable
higher
abv
refreshing
ale
not
great
but
good
for
the
last
week

pay
day
pours
a

color
with
a

but
quicklydissipating
white
head
aroma
was
heavy
malt
with
dark
fruit
taste
is
malt
dark
fruit
with
honey
and
vanilla
hops
barely
detectable
though
there
was
a
slight
crisp
finish
smooth
creamy
palate
nothing
spectacular
but
i
liked
the
flavor
and
alcohol
warmth
in
this
on
a
cool
fall
day
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
large
foamy
offwhite
head
that
soon
settled
down
to
a
scummy
islandand
ring
color
is
a
clear
medium
honey
amber
with
a
lot
of
large
bubble
trails
aroma
is
coincidently
of
malt
honey
hop
flavor
is
mainly
two
parts
sweet
and
carbonic
tang
with
a
little
bitter
in
back
if
it
werent
for
the
pronounced
carbonation
it
would
be
about
undrinkable
even
so
body
is
ok
while
carbonation
seems
forced
finish
is
like
flavor
has
significant
alcohol
warmth
and
is
totally
forgettable
a
fairly
shallow
brew
not
for
repetition
so
for
those
days
when
youre
watching
football
or
whatever
and
want
to
get
buzzed
forget
bud
or
yuengling
and
pick
up
a
few
4packs
of
this
stuff
well
worth
it
id
drink
this
again
overall
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
style
the
nose
isnt
great
but
everything
else
is
enjoyable
refreshing
boozy
enough
to
get
a
buzz
on
and
affordable
may
repeat
this
one
yet
again
o
a
reasonably
tasty
euro
strong
lager
flavour
is
mild
but
at
7
this
stuff
is
surprisingly
drinkable
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
o
this
is
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
and
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
i
liked
the
maltiness
and
thicker
mouthfeel
compared
to
other
malt
liquors
especially
the
american
varieties
o
a
good
strong
lager
all
my
relatives
were
crushing
it
and
there
arent
many
7
that
id
imagine
theyd
like
that
counts
for
something
a
boring
style
well
executed
perhaps
a
good
table
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
treacle
colour
with
a
limited
head
aroma
of
smoky
and
sweet
malts
however
the
flavour
leans
more
towards
a
malt
beverage
or
simple
barley
wine
unfortunately
the
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
is
the
most
pronounced
feature
although
my
experience
is
limited
i
dont
believe
this
is
polands
best
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
slight
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
sweet
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
a
better
smell
than
taste
in
my
opinion
this
beer
tasted
better
than
it
smelled
and
exceeded
my
expectations
this
might
even
pair
well
with
polish
food
all
in
all
this
might
be
worth
trying
again
overall
when
you
factor
in
price
and
what
your
getting
out
of
the
beer
it
is
like
hitting
lotto
buying
this
beer
i
really
liked
it
was
it
the
best
beer
ever
no
but
it
was
damn
sure
satisfying
salud
i
think
the
flavour
starts
to
improve
as
the
beer
warms
finish
remains
somewhat
sour
although
aftertaste
is
smooth
this
beer
definitely
has
some
redeeming
characteristics
and
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
a
bit
more
from
when
i
first
tasted
it
not
amazing
but
not
terrible
its
hard
not
to
give
warka
strong
a
decent
rating
its
my
regular
go
to
beer
its
a
bit
malty
with
some
sweet
notes
the
color
is
between
dark
yellow
and
amber
but
the
head
doesnt
hold
up
as
well
as
with
other
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
crisp
and
as
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
there
isnt
much
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
its
fairly
strong
7
abv
comes
in
pintsized
bottles
the
label
wasnt
real
clear
that
this
was
the
strong
version
but
the
7
abv
was
noted
on
the
label
decent
my
first
polish
beer
an
okay
beer
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
winter
night
at
its
price
and
size
i
drank
it
solo
but
it
would
pair
well
with
almost
any
lunch
dinner
or
snack
o
not
bad
really
not
sure
what
would
be
the
right
time
and
place
for
drinking
this
stuff
sweet
and
boozy
without
much
else
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
here
an
inexpensive
polish
beer
at
the
local
store
with
a
good
balance
of
flavor
and
drinkablity
a
complete
steal
for
about
1
50
for
a
half
litre
final
grade
3
56
a
b
grade
o
wow
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
a
well
balanced
beer
that
was
enjoyable
from
first
sip
to
last
not
necessarily
a
beer
or
style
i
would
hunt
for
but
a
beer
worth
revisiting
are
you
drinking
a
wimpy
polish
beer
wanna
get
the
girls
attention
then
try
warka
strong
a
stronger
beer
for
a
stronger
man
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
shortlived
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
musty
caramel
light
wheat
light
buttery
biscuits
and
a
definite
air
of
green
apple
flesh
the
taste
pushes
the
green
apple
to
the
fore
fruity
caramel
still
as
musty
as
before
a
light
twinge
of
alcohol
sweet
flowers
and
straight
cane
sugar
its
all
just
a
sweet
boozy
mess
the
body
is
a
heftyaspiring
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
sorta
painful
beer
to
drink
its
too
sweet
its
too
fruity
and
theres
way
too
much
alcohol
on
the
tongue
for
the
abv
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
and
didnt
but
was
quite
surprised
at
how
bad
it
wasnt
this
was
a
sample
and
samples
are
always
great
cause
theyre
free
not
a
bad
example
of
a
european
lager
thanks
bill
for
this
freebee
overall
there
are
really
quite
a
lot
of
beers
in
the
world
and
this
seems
to
be
just
one
of
them
average
nope
this
is
not
my
kind
of
beer
boozy
sticky
and
frankly
quite
uninteresting
i
do
not
understand
the
ranking
it
got
so
far
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
it
smells
of
pale
malts
and
thats
about
it
the
flavor
is
of
only
pale
malt
and
light
honey
it
is
so
so
light
the
honey
like
sweetness
is
moderately
appealing
though
it
drinks
so
so
light
in
body
and
is
pretty
thin
this
beer
just
isnt
complex
in
any
manner
i
can
see
why
the
store
cant
keep
it
in
stock
being
1
99
but
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
its
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
price
and
will
get
this
again
when
needed
1
80
for
a
500ml
single
overall
i
was
happy
with
the
fact
that
it
was
at
least
a
little
bit
different
than
the
hundreds
of
other
euro
beers
that
are
available
at
the
lcbo
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
vienna
lager
aspect
to
it
that
being
said
it
still
wasnt
anything
fantastic
happy
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
not
a
drainpour
but
hard
to
finish
pleasantly
suprised
thought
this
would
be
an
alcoholic
street
drinker
special
this
isnt
the
case
all
around
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
tend
to
shy
away
from
lagers
but
this
is
a
beer
ill
be
revisiting
in
the
future
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
character
in
the
aroma
but
no
follow
through
in
the
flavor
the
sweetness
is
almost
syrupy
with
out
much
support
dr
not
going
to
buy
it
again
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
is
fairly
high
abv
relatively
speaking
but
it
doesnt
appeal
to
me
bham
uk
dec
2010
for
the
price
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
this
is
my
first
time
reviewing
it
i
usually
drink
this
beer
after
a
heavy
hitting
barleywine
it
makes
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
goes
great
with
any
kind
of
beef
pours
an
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
fluffy
head
that
fades
with
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
nutty
and
green
hops
and
sweet
grainadjunct
the
taste
starts
out
pretty
thin
but
then
builds
into
a
creamy
strangely
sweet
end
its
a
bit
on
the
flat
side
which
exasperates
the
sweetness
which
almost
reminds
me
of
honey
finish
is
slightly
lingering
will
some
mild
bitterness
coming
through
and
the
body
is
medium
the
bottle
does
a
good
job
of
describing
this
one
it
says
beer
unique
taste
around
the
top
and
id
have
to
agree
final
thoughts
when
i
drink
this
im
perplexed
it
honestly
tastes
like
im
drinking
a
high
class
malt
liquor
which
then
begs
the
question
if
you
are
drinking
malt
liquor
are
you
really
looking
for
something
high
class
i
wouldnt
pick
up
this
beer
again
but
ill
give
it
one
thing
i
was
honestly
expecting
it
to
fare
a
lot
worse
d
i
would
drink
this
again
i
bought
a
single
16
9
bottle
just
to
try
something
new
it
had
a
much
darker
color
than
i
expected
i
also
was
not
aware
of
this
beers
strength
it
sure
does
pack
a
punch
at
7
percent
there
is
a
strong
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
consistency
of
this
beer
is
good
for
a
session
but
not
at
7
percent
just
an
average
beer
bottle
poured
a
deep
golden
color
lager
with
a
medium
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
adjunct
is
kind
of
gross
with
loads
of
residual
sugar
taste
is
also
dominated
by
adjunct
and
sugar
which
does
not
make
for
an
interesting
drink
body
is
quite
full
with
an
oily
feel
and
medium
carbonation
light
notes
of
fusel
alcohol
are
perceptible
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
again
in
the
near
future
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
too
much
of
overall
its
fine
but
i
dont
think
id
go
looking
for
it
ive
tried
a
couple
others
of
this
style
and
id
have
to
say
its
significantly
better
than
average
but
maybe
the
style
just
isnt
much
to
write
home
about
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
alcohol
taste
is
of
malts
caramel
some
alcohol
slightly
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
d
while
the
alcohol
would
certainly
load
up
after
a
few
of
these
im
afraid
the
overwhelming
sweetness
would
get
me
well
before
then
this
is
a
smooth
quality
strong
lager
that
was
a
good
pick
from
my
local
polish
supermarket
i
just
wish
it
had
more
of
a
hop
profile
d
drinks
reasonably
easy
though
it
is
a
bit
high
on
the
abv
side
higher
than
it
tastes
one
of
the
better
polish
beers
ive
encountered
at
the
lcbo
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
but
still
a
fine
effort
ill
probably
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
to
get
me
through
this
wintry
week
notes
seems
kind
of
like
a
polish
malt
liquor
flavors
just
dont
quite
work
for
me
but
they
grew
on
me
a
bit
im
not
entirely
sure
why
but
they
are
just
a
little
off
to
me
from
the
500
ml
bottle
that
does
have
a
best
by
date
but
it
is
unreadable
sampled
on
february
22
2010
the
pour
is
actually
kind
of
copperamber
with
beautiful
clarity
but
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
licorice
and
a
vague
dash
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
the
taste
is
sweet
wellmalted
and
has
a
nice
toasted
bread
backdrop
there
is
also
a
hard
liquor
feel
to
it
as
well
like
bourbon
it
was
a
strong
ale
that
did
a
yeomans
job
hiding
the
7
abv
d
meh
ive
had
worse
but
i
wouldnt
track
this
beer
down
first
off
the
picture
of
the
beer
should
be
changed
because
it
has
long
since
changed
to
a
new
label
i
saw
warka
strong
at
work
wines
unlimited
of
stratford
ct
and
noticed
many
of
our
european
and
especially
polish
customers
would
purchase
this
item
like
hot
cakes
while
many
of
our
other
imports
would
be
at
a
stand
still
this
beer
remained
supreme
this
encouraged
me
to
at
least
try
it
of
course
when
i
first
drank
this
beer
i
was
very
impressed
by
how
smooth
it
was
for
a
beer
at
7
it
was
a
light
amber
color
plentiful
taste
of
semi
sweet
characteristics
that
werent
overwhelming
warka
strong
is
a
delicious
beer
and
has
a
nice
firm
but
subtle
finish
that
doesnt
linger
a
nasty
hopfull
mouth
after
having
this
beer
i
researched
it
and
have
gathered
the
following
warka
strong
is
a
polish
beer
from
zywiec
group
also
available
in
a
lower
avb
and
is
paired
well
with
polish
pastries
that
include
blueberries
and
also
buttered
toasts
however
the
beer
is
good
by
itself
nothing
to
scream
about
but
impressive
this
beer
is
available
to
our
store
through
a
small
distributor
called
amtec
in
fairfield
county
in
connecticut
that
has
an
all
polish
beer
portfolio
11
2
ounce
bottle
i
hate
when
the
imports
jip
me
of
that
8
of
an
ounce
the
best
before
date
is
six
months
from
now
golden
bronze
color
with
a
shortlived
head
and
good
clarity
occasional
bubbles
stream
to
the
surface
the
aroma
is
better
than
what
im
used
to
in
strong
lagers
theres
a
welcomed
absence
of
that
alcoholchemical
scent
i
only
detect
sweet
carmel
maltyness
and
grain
good
texture
and
it
leaves
that
sticky
sweet
film
on
your
teeth
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
little
carmel
and
perhaps
a
tiny
trace
of
honey
starts
off
easy
and
gets
heavy
towards
the
end
in
terms
of
drinkability
pretty
filling
good
beer
i
got
a
little
more
then
expected
while
drinking
this
one
and
thats
never
a
bad
thing
while
just
a
wee
bit
onesided
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
enough
strong
euro
lager
without
any
of
the
bitter
edge
or
skunkiness
ive
come
to
expect
from
its
forebears
around
here
the
alcohol
that
begets
the
strong
denomination
is
noticeable
sure
but
pretty
well
integrated
for
the
most
part
this
polish
lager
tastes
a
wee
bit
like
a
scottish
ale
to
me
quite
enjoyable
i
believe
i
will
head
back
to
the
shop
i
got
this
and
look
for
a
sixer
d
better
on
the
colder
side
as
the
adjuncts
come
out
a
little
more
as
it
warms
but
i
was
still
pleasantly
surprised
d
drinkable
yes
but
i
find
its
lacking
some
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
with
average
lacingthe
first
aroma
i
get
is
straight
out
malty
honey
not
much
else
gets
thruit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
a
honeyishmalty
weak
hop
taste
to
it
which
finishes
pretty
smooththis
is
definately
i
beer
that
im
glad
ive
tried
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
drinkability
ok
for
an
euro
lager
probably
wont
buy
it
again
drinkability
im
not
terribly
impressed
this
is
a
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
i
doubt
will
get
again
drink
i
wont
buy
it
again
i
guess
if
you
want
a
high
alcohol
sweet
tasting
lager
go
for
it
a
decent
brew
would
work
well
with
a
fully
loaded
pizza
surprisingly
balanced
in
the
style
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can
pick
up
a
bottle
my
friend
offered
this
beer
to
me
when
i
was
over
to
his
house
for
dinner
he
warned
that
it
was
strong
and
boy
he
was
not
kidding
the
beer
had
a
hint
of
a
sweet
taste
to
it
but
the
bitterness
on
the
tongue
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
something
that
i
was
willing
to
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
it
had
no
real
aftertaste
definitely
would
recommend
im
glad
that
i
tried
this
but
id
like
to
try
other
types
of
this
style
to
compare
to
and
will
probably
try
other
polish
beers
before
coming
back
to
this
one
this
is
a
remarkably
average
sort
of
beer
with
it
falling
short
on
a
lot
of
its
aspects
decent
but
certainly
not
fantastic
not
a
fan
a
lager
on
steroids
would
recommend
trying
especially
at
1
50
a
bottle
if
the
belgian
strong
ales
are
little
expensive
this
is
a
nice
alternative
warka
poured
a
pale
orange
kinda
burnt
orange
that
looked
like
it
wanted
to
turn
light
brown
nice
inch
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
was
grainy
bready
with
scent
of
alcohol
present
it
also
had
a
sweetness
smell
i
have
difficulty
labeling
almost
like
juicey
tasted
of
sweet
caramel
with
some
nuttiness
the
7
wasnt
detectable
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
nice
coating
the
drinkability
would
be
high
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
its
a
strong
euro
lager
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
strong
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
but
its
still
a
really
good
beer
so
this
is
essentially
euromacromalt
liquor
hey
ive
had
much
worse
the
mild
grainy
sweetness
must
go
well
with
pierogi
the
taste
is
also
very
nice
with
bread
a
hint
of
herbs
and
pine
light
fruit
mix
grapes
bread
crust
and
a
light
smokeywoody
quality
in
the
finish
it
has
a
flowery
quality
and
is
zesty
but
in
feel
becomes
a
bit
watery
and
flat
by
the
finish
otherwise
its
quite
good
with
plenty
of
nice
flavour
if
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
it
has
a
light
bitterness
but
could
use
a
bit
more
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
stays
interesting
d
this
beer
packs
a
wallop
one
500ml
bottle
was
enough
for
me
definitely
not
a
session
beer
in
my
mind
worth
a
revisit
d
a
pleasant
surprise
making
for
a
solid
recommend
and
drink
definitely
one
of
the
better
and
stronger
beers
ive
had
out
of
poland
and
worthy
of
a
buy
and
try
i
tried
this
beer
on
february
11
2008
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
slight
reddish
tinge
the
head
was
thin
and
white
and
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
effervescence
the
aroma
was
rather
weak
nothing
at
all
that
comes
to
mind
aside
from
some
grassy
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
light
almost
watery
and
little
carbonation
the
taste
was
very
grassy
was
well
with
some
malty
hints
amber
body
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
gives
this
polish
lager
a
pleasing
appearance
the
aroma
has
grainy
notes
mixed
in
with
lemon
the
initial
flavour
impression
is
of
sweetness
with
bunches
of
caramel
malt
thankfully
is
settles
down
after
the
first
few
sips
and
becomes
better
integrated
into
the
overall
taste
which
although
still
sweet
malt
heavy
now
reveals
a
husky
graininess
and
a
slight
bitter
kick
in
the
finish
probably
still
too
much
sweetness
to
earn
more
than
an
average
mark
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
satisfying
easily
the
heaviest
i
have
come
across
in
a
lager
the
carbonation
is
about
right
for
the
drink
and
prevents
it
from
becoming
too
cloying
pretty
drinkable
and
a
pleasant
surprise
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
fizzy
head
rises
up
smells
of
more
fusel
based
alcohol
grains
and
hops
as
well
body
is
a
little
muddled
taste
is
strong
nice
hoppy
kick
near
the
end
the
beer
has
character
is
well
constructed
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
it
was
fine
but
there
was
nothing
unique
or
exciting
about
it
d
i
really
like
this
beer
but
that
sweetness
keeps
me
from
wanting
more
than
one
if
it
was
only
slightly
less
sweet
the
high
abv
would
make
it
a
killer
session
beer
a
hop
flavor
of
fresh
cut
grass
develops
late
a
fine
polish
lager
a
bit
sweet
understated
nose
but
full
bodied
warming
and
flavorful
a
well
constructed
beer
me
tarzan
you
jane
warka
strong
actually
the
beer
isnt
very
strong
and
it
isnt
very
good
either
i
almost
wish
the
alcohol
was
more
prominent
malt
liquors
and
euro
strong
lagers
need
to
be
ballsy
to
be
good
this
one
is
simply
boring
and
forgettable
this
is
one
helluva
beer
wish
i
would
have
tried
it
sooner
by
far
one
of
the
best
polish
brews
ive
ever
locked
my
lips
onto
a
must
try
for
bock
lovers
my
bottles
said
best
by
6
2008
so
i
know
its
fresh
very
very
good
dont
pass
this
one
up
d
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
definitely
maltliquory
and
theres
a
forced
booziness
but
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
heavy
and
allows
for
good
transitions
in
the
mouth
little
carbonation
to
speak
of
on
the
tongue
try
this
beer
and
dont
be
fooled
by
the
look
tallboy
cans
very
fresh
smooth
with
no
off
flavors
nice
toasted
malt
and
sweet
apple
notes
clean
and
refreshing
its
a
solid
budget
buy
for
the
style
raising
scores
a
little
bit
well
done
and
tastey
when
fresh
overall
a
good
brew
malty
pleasant
and
understated
worth
a
try
i
like
this
beer
give
it
a
try
lots
of
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
of
my
glass
and
a
small
one
finger
head
that
is
white
and
didnt
last
long
cleargolden
bodyit
looks
very
lagerish
i
smell
carmel
and
rice
carmel
in
the
taste
and
its
pleasant
nice
lacing
on
the
glassmouthful
is
good
but
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
and
that
brings
the
mouthful
and
drinkability
down
a
notch
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
or
anything
like
that
thanks
to
stosh
for
this
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
this
is
not
a
beer
you
are
likely
to
chug
really
i
think
this
should
be
considered
a
bock
beer
it
certainly
tastes
like
one
pours
a
clear
ambergold
big
fluffy
white
head
settles
down
to
a
thin
ring
rather
quick
some
lace
spots
smell
is
sweet
some
citrus
minor
skunk
booze
metallic
one
of
the
better
for
this
style
ive
smelled
taste
is
not
bad
at
all
almost
a
figgy
caramelized
flavour
to
it
citrus
floral
booze
isnt
out
of
control
weak
finish
but
quite
enjoyable
when
cold
alcohol
does
not
show
itself
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
surprisingly
okay
pours
with
an
almost
orange
colour
very
little
head
to
speak
of
somewhat
dusty
malt
smell
with
a
bit
of
fruit
beer
has
a
very
bready
taste
with
some
dry
crackers
and
even
cookies
dark
fruit
taste
with
a
tad
of
citrus
does
not
improve
with
warmth
oh
man
i
drink
the
beer
a
bit
cool
at
first
and
then
let
it
warm
usually
this
improves
smell
and
taste
not
with
this
beer
warms
and
their
is
a
foul
dust
taste
reminds
me
of
an
attic
if
the
beer
is
warm
taste
is
a
2
0
cold
3
0
ill
give
it
the
cold
rating
has
a
carbonation
similar
to
sodas
still
a
bit
creamy
drinkable
only
when
cold
if
its
ice
cold
i
mean
near
frozen
it
is
good
malt
liquer
if
it
starts
to
get
warm
you
better
start
sucking
on
some
keilbasa
or
youre
in
line
for
one
sharp
headache
a
really
fresh
malty
smell
reminds
of
when
i
was
in
munich
even
though
this
is
a
polish
beer
th
common
denominator
being
that
its
fresh
and
robust
there
are
many
eastern
european
brews
at
the
lcbo
and
most
are
pale
and
some
are
putrid
but
some
are
very
fine
this
one
is
very
fine
its
strong
and
flavourful
warka
you
are
my
friend
pretty
close
to
malt
liquor
in
my
opinion
sweet
bland
and
alcoholic
honeyish
colour
with
fast
dissapearing
head
no
aroma
taste
was
a
bit
of
malt
a
bit
of
bitter
a
drop
of
fruit
and
spice
neutral
mouthfeel
slightly
grainy
i
would
like
more
malt
and
yet
not
all
that
bitter
not
too
drinkable
there
are
a
lot
better
polish
beers
about
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
golden
amber
brew
foamy
head
lasts
well
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
somewhat
adjuctladen
as
expected
for
the
style
taste
really
follows
the
nose
the
adjunct
notes
are
present
throughout
but
actually
not
so
much
in
a
bad
way
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
from
beginning
to
end
esp
for
the
style
and
drinkability
is
great
reminds
me
of
dfh
malt
liquor
just
not
quite
as
strong
surprisingly
worth
a
try
keep
this
one
cold
becomes
much
less
drinkable
as
it
warms
could
be
sessionable
but
not
to
hard
to
find
something
better
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
i
dont
suggest
this
as
a
session
beer
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
taste
isnt
unpleasant
when
very
cold
some
nuttiness
summer
fruit
such
as
apple
and
apricot
spicy
notes
followed
by
a
wholesome
breadiness
as
it
warms
though
the
taste
becomes
almost
too
sweet
to
bear
theres
no
decent
hops
to
balance
this
out
and
that
makes
things
very
hard
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
very
creamy
smooth
drinkability
is
low
because
i
need
to
worry
about
the
dentist
bills
incurred
by
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
overall
a
pretty
decent
strong
lager
nothing
amazing
but
probably
worth
a
try
lately
i
have
been
induging
in
a
variety
of
polish
beers
that
are
readily
available
in
the
buffalo
area
and
i
have
to
say
for
the
most
part
i
have
been
pleasantly
suprised
this
poured
a
beep
clear
golden
with
a
quick
to
form
and
quick
to
fade
12
finger
white
headsomewhat
sweet
and
toasty
in
the
nose
a
little
caramel
and
hints
of
alchol
even
more
so
as
it
warms
nice
full
mouthfeel
it
even
seems
to
coat
the
mouth
a
little
starts
out
with
some
caramel
sweetness
over
top
of
some
toasty
grain
the
alcohol
seems
to
stay
in
check
there
is
a
subtle
peppery
spic
in
the
finish
wich
caps
it
off
quite
well
being
of
polish
dissent
its
great
to
try
the
different
beers
from
there
many
of
wich
people
have
no
idea
about
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
moderatelysized
stable
soapy
head
its
a
fresh
aroma
thats
focused
on
light
malts
and
grassy
smells
backed
with
just
a
slight
whiff
of
hops
the
aroma
isnt
all
it
could
be
but
its
pleasant
mild
fresh
and
inviting
not
much
alcohol
in
the
aroma
given
the
abv
the
taste
left
me
a
little
underwhelmed
a
serious
sweetness
without
a
corresponding
malt
quality
is
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
dont
get
me
wrong
theres
malt
in
the
taste
its
just
not
pronounced
in
a
manner
that
corresponds
to
the
sweetness
this
leaves
the
beer
with
a
hollow
and
just
this
side
of
cloying
feeling
i
wouldnt
call
it
well
balanced
behind
the
sweetness
theres
some
grassiness
a
lot
more
hops
would
help
moderately
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
full
soft
rounded
and
mouthfilling
it
definetly
gives
you
the
sense
that
youre
drinking
something
substantial
which
is
nicevery
filling
i
wish
that
there
were
some
complexity
to
the
flavor
to
go
along
with
it
all
in
all
this
one
isnt
badit
would
go
well
with
some
polish
food
bigos
on
its
own
its
not
a
standout
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
have
had
beers
with
higher
abvs
that
cover
the
alcohol
taste
more
this
has
little
else
except
leaving
something
of
a
sticky
caramel
flavor
nevertheless
the
watery
qualities
does
even
it
out
a
bit
i
was
easily
able
to
finish
it
but
was
not
feeling
the
need
to
go
get
more
its
better
than
malt
liquors
but
not
by
much
the
thought
that
i
had
after
it
was
a
polish
version
of
a
lets
get
bombed
brew
while
not
offensive
it
really
doesnt
have
much
to
it
to
make
it
anything
above
average
poured
a
highlighty
amber
with
some
spearse
lacing
and
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
disappeared
into
nothingness
smell
was
a
metallic
toasted
malt
with
a
few
bananas
tasted
almost
the
same
as
the
smell
except
instead
of
a
metallic
taste
it
was
more
like
hard
water
and
the
malt
presence
was
more
pronounced
hop
flavor
is
pretty
light
taste
likes
german
hops
were
used
this
is
a
very
complex
full
flavored
lager
its
definitely
the
second
best
polish
beer
ive
tried
so
far
after
okocim
porter
highly
recommended
clear
coppery
colour
nice
lacing
off
the
pour
after
the
head
recedes
a
bit
quite
a
rich
caramel
malty
aroma
very
mildly
hopped
mild
bitterness
thats
present
throughout
just
not
the
focus
here
malt
is
definitely
the
focus
light
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
some
nuttiness
theres
a
bit
of
spicy
alcohol
in
the
finish
as
well
medium
bodied
slightly
drying
easily
quaffable
with
more
flavour
than
i
expected
this
was
my
first
polish
beer
and
cannot
say
i
was
dissapointed
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
strong
hopped
out
american
beers
that
i
typically
drink
rather
than
an
extreme
hoppiness
there
was
a
very
deep
and
layered
maltiness
what
i
most
liked
about
the
malt
profile
was
the
distinct
nuttiness
despite
the
high
alcohol
level
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
beer
that
i
will
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
looks
nice
rich
amber
color
and
a
reasonable
white
head
smell
is
pretty
basic
malts
and
slight
hops
the
taste
however
threw
me
a
big
curve
ball
my
first
three
sips
tasted
straght
up
like
vodka
and
its
not
as
if
im
not
accustomed
to
drinking
10
brews
thankfully
the
harsh
flavor
faded
other
than
that
a
basic
malty
strong
lager
with
poorly
masked
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
for
the
style
well
cabonated
and
slightly
slick
but
personaly
i
cant
say
this
was
much
better
than
average
crystal
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
giant
head
that
forms
a
nice
looking
dome
atop
the
beer
light
malt
in
the
nose
and
taste
this
beer
is
relatively
bland
but
definitely
hides
the
7
abv
well
some
sweet
malty
flavors
a
touch
of
grass
and
adjunct
i
like
the
mouthfeel
carbonated
enough
but
not
overpowering
an
above
average
euro
lager
that
i
could
easily
session
light
copper
orange
in
colour
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
aromas
are
of
ripe
soft
fruit
caramel
menthol
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
lager
type
of
mouthfeel
with
this
one
strong
malt
presence
with
at
least
some
herbal
hop
contribution
i
was
expecting
bad
things
from
this
beer
but
its
not
too
bad
at
all
although
not
really
my
style
it
would
probably
go
over
well
with
the
malt
liquor
crowd
the
bottle
i
had
just
said
warka
beer
and
had
an
abv
of
7
so
i
would
assume
this
was
the
strong
one
good
stuff
poland
has
some
tasty
beers
warka
strong
delivers
a
clear
amber
body
beneath
a
frothy
head
of
ivory
foam
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
transient
splotches
of
leace
with
each
sip
the
nose
reveals
only
some
sweetish
caramel
malt
its
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
soft
carbonation
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
rich
caramelish
and
nutty
with
a
very
thin
thread
of
hop
flavor
and
a
lowkey
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
at
the
same
time
it
almost
adds
to
the
character
of
the
beer
and
helps
to
balance
its
malty
sweetness
it
finishes
with
a
slowly
receeding
wave
of
toffeelike
sweetnes
thats
dried
a
bit
by
a
wash
of
alcohol
before
it
fades
and
more
nuttiness
appears
wow
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
its
not
a
quaffer
by
any
means
it
would
work
well
i
think
with
a
thanksgiving
dinner
and
could
certainly
hold
its
ground
as
an
apertif
or
afterdinner
drink
and
it
might
even
pair
well
with
a
dessert
such
as
a
pecan
or
cherry
pie
very
nice
overall
really
not
bad
i
have
seen
this
exported
to
italy
before
and
i
must
say
i
really
enjoy
it
over
all
not
a
1
but
very
drinkable
o
a
very
neutral
and
forgettable
beer
it
does
not
seem
to
have
gained
any
significant
character
from
being
brewed
to
this
high
alcohol
content
330ml
bottle
from
local
bar
in
calabria
italy
pours
a
deep
crystal
clear
golden
copper
with
a
medium
lasting
white
head
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
dark
fruit
notes
dates
as
it
warms
up
with
some
yeast
and
alcohol
esters
taste
same
as
aroma
with
some
sweet
bitter
flavors
and
a
bit
of
spicy
notes
as
well
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
finishes
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
yeast
dates
and
a
lingering
sweet
alcohol
and
nutty
flavor
overall
nothing
really
stand
out
for
this
brew
an
average
ale
oi
would
say
this
is
strong
beer
with
lower
strong
taste
had
this
one
in
torino
italy
medium

this
isnt

beer
really
i
found
the
bottle
to
be
to
big
660ml
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
would
drink
it
again
if
it
were
given
to
me
o
a
very
easy
drink
and
overall
a
decently
enjoyable
beer
dr
high
abv
and
a
very
low
price
especially
for
an
import
that
said
its
barely
drinkable
and
wouldnt
even
make
a
good
beer
for
getting
bollocksed
with
the
lads
on
a
night
in
leave
her
on
the
shelf
lads
and
get
some
proper
beer
overal
it
had
too
much
alcohol
for
its
depth
of
flavours
and
body
feel
the
sort
of
beer
that
gives
you
a
cracking
headache
if
large
amounts
were
to
be
consummed
i
do
like
heineken
on
draft
it
doesnt
have
as
much
of
the
poor
qualities
o
drinkable
overall
better
than
the
heineken
i
had
coming
into
town
on
the
train
d
not
great
not
bad
selection
when
in
italy
it
is
still
very
much
available
everywhere
that
i
went
in
italy
notes
ughhh
this
is
a
high
alcohol
flamer
at
its
finest
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
that
has
tons
of
alcohol
crisp
clean
refreshing
interesting
forget
about
it
i
see
they
have
changed
the
style
to
euro
strong
lager
which
is
exactly
where
id
put
it
as
well
avoid
opinion
needless
to
say
that
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
there
is
too
much
corn
flavor
and
aroma
for
my
taste
and
it
tastes
like
they
were
just
trying
to
crank
the
gravity
up
oh
well
ill
just
have
to
keep
trying
to
find
the
holy
grail
of
beer
heck
of
a
job
i
must
say
oh
i
see
you
are
doing
it
too

dark

with
a

nose
show
the
same
grassy
and
spicy
hops
as
the
regular
budvar
but
loads
more
rich
malt
similar
flavours
but
the
hops
dont
show
as
much
very
malty
hints
of
golden
syrup
and
brown
sugar
very
sweet
nice
syrupy
body
and
moderate
carbonation
i
really
didnt
mind
this
simply
put
a
strong
pils
thats
what
it
is
dont
be
surprised
a
little
less
on
the
nose
than
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
wasnt
unpleasant
not
as
sweet
as
other
high
abv
lagers
strong
but
palatable
bitterness
and
a
solid
mouthfeel
and
finish
pretty
good
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
although
this
is
a
beer
that
really
needs
to
be
drank
slowly
given
its
strength
o
good
drinkability
recommended
not
so
good
poured
with
a
large
off
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
almost
zero
and
no

is

small
bubble

is

and
skunky
green
glass
and
i
even
got
it
towards
the
back
of
the
cooler
away
from
the
fluorescent
light
flavor
is
a
weird
bitterness
dominated
by
sweetness
body
is
full

round
and
the
carbonation
while
a
bit
fizzy
does
help
cut
the
sweetness
finish
is
sweet
and
that
weird
bitterness
not
for
me
alcky
beer
i
think
d
excellent
fantastic
not
particularly
heavy
for
the
alcohol
content
d
hard
to
drink
rather
to
heavy
should
be
lighter
hides
its
alcohol
well
though
drinkability
i
is
not
to
bad
i
am
not
drinking
it
like
i
would
in
my
youth
but
it
is
an
average
beer
for
the
most
part
by
the
end
its
way
too
harsh
and
heavy
and
it
loses
a
great
deal
of
its
drinkability
as
a
result
suprisingly
and
slightly
dissapointedly
not
a
particulary
stellar
offering
from
budvar
while
ill
advocaate
pivovar
budvar
to
the
death
versus
its
rival
ill
say
that
this
beer
is
a
possible
ploy
towards
moving
its
drinkers
towards
a
market
inflated
by
strong
beers
and
a
declination
in
quality
its
still
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
regularly
drink
especially
because
of
the
inflated
price
versus
its
other
arguably
higher
quality
offerings
ill
recommend
a
try
but
if
youre
in
the
czech
republic
and
looking
for
a
stronger
beer
try
some
others
like
svijany
baron
or
some
by
pivovar
nachod
try
once
just
for
the
heck
of
it

alcoholics
looking
for
a
quick
fix
could
do
worse
and
to
be
sure
that
seems
to
be
the
brewerys
targeted
demographic
but
no
average
drinker
should
subject
themselves
the
vintners
of
alsace
like
the
german
brewers
across
the
vosges
mountains
have
nothing
to
fear
of
brasserie
de
saverne
this
is
no
threat
to
their
reputations
overall
its
not
that
bad
good
one
after
a
work
day
overall
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
and
basically
got
what
i
was
expecting
a
harsh
tasting
beer
that
ill
never
want
to
drink
again
i
see
now
why
this
was
placed
where
it
was
while
still
beer
its
one
big
sweet
boozy
mess
d
not
a
bad
drink
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
quick
i
would
never
recommend
this
for
anybody
aiming
to
try
a
tasty
beer
though
tasty
for
a
cheap
high
abv
though
it
didnt
offend
me
as
much
as
some
people
but
at
the
same
time
it
didnt
impress
me
like
others
this
beer
would
be
great
if
you
just
want
to
get
smashed
and
dont
want
to
spend
much
money
other
then
that
i
dont
recommend
it

an
orange

contrary
to

have
noted

sits
around

edge
of

glass
immediately
alcohol
attacks
the
nose
followed
by
an
acidic
citrus
rind
aroma
some
malt
in
the
aroma
as
well
trailed
by
faint
adjunct
and
chemicalish
wafts
taste
is
sweet
some
orange
peel
alcohol
is
very
much
here
lots
of
corn
and
sickly
sweet
malt
finish
is
cloying
some
hops
in
the
aftertaste
absolutely
a
malt
liquor
i
prefer
the
younger
brother
of
boris
bold
wow
the
head
looked
like
the
top
of
a
vanilla
icecream
cone
round
bonewhite
good
retention
nice
the
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
a
grainy
sweetness
that
is
characteristic
for
lagers
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
metallic
overtone
underlain
with
a
cornlike
sweetness
finish
continued
with
that
same
metalcorn
combination
oof
i
feel
i
can
drink
this
one
down
but
wouldnt
care
for
another
this
is
a
gimmick
beer
marketed
to
younger
folks
who
want
to
get
canned
biegaman
gave
me
this
one
thanks
very
clear
and
gold
this
one
started
with
a
dense
white
cap
but
quickly
fell
to
a
ring
it
produced
a
bit
of
streaky
lacing
too
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
grainy
malt
and
some
fruity
esters
very
low
bitterness
mostly
sweet
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
and
an
acrid
finish
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
syrupy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
was
very
hot
not
very
good
and
not
overly
drinkable
i
didnt
finish
my
can
its
just
an
alcohol
bomb
with
little
malt
or
hop
depth
id
be
surprised
if
it
isnt
made
exclusively
from
extract
certainly
not
a
good
example
of
a
strong
eurolager
drinkability
i
guess
if
you
dont
like
good
beer
it
is
alright
it
will
get
you
drunk

some

alcohol
touch

standard
for
the

taste
is
the
same
although
the

is
right
at
the
front
bit
of
graininess
corn
caramel
bit
smooth
in
the
finish

is
light

medium

medium

but
not
too
bad
for
the
style
thanks
jan
d
drinks
well
especially
considering
the
alcohol
loses
marks
for
not
offering
anything
extra
to
make
it
seem
more
interesting
final
analysis
is
that
i
like
it
but
am
not
sure
why
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
strong
beers
and
this
was
no
exception
the
strong
beers
that
i
have
liked
have
usually
had
a
depth
of
taste
that
is
in
the
forefront
in
this
case
it
is
the
strong
alcohol
content
that
is
in
the
forefront
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
for
anything
else
but
to
get
drunk
fast
when
it
comes
to
extremely
strong
beers
910
i
would
prefer
this
better
being
how
it
is
a
bit
tastier
then
most
500ml
can
poured
a
semidark
yellow
color
beer
with
large
white
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
carbonation
seems
quite
low
and
the
beer
has
a
strong
grainy
aroma
which
i
didnt
enjoy
taste
is
also
way
too
grainy
for
my
taste
and
this
beer
resemble
more
of
a
malt
liquor
then
a
european
strong
lager
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
which
doesnt
really
matter
since
this
beer
ended
up
being
poured
in
the
drain
drinkability
i
guess
i
have
a
stronger
constitution
than
the
other
reviewers
so
i
chugged
it
down
and
it
stayed
down
i
would
drink
more
if
it
were
the
only
beer
available
if
i
had
some
strong
cheese
or
bbq
doritos
and
someone
else
was
buying
ive
managed
to
choke
down
about
a
third
of
a
glass
of
this
stuff
and
ive
had
enough
of
it
for
the
rest
of
my
lifesink
pour
time
it
made
quite
an
impression
and
i
shall
avoid
this
boris
bold
so
it
cannot
become
a
repeat
offender
ive
been
violated
enough
this
is
an
unpleasant
beer
i
saw
the
can
among
the
other
polish
lagers
the
logo
is
nice
with
the
bison
and
the
name
so
i
bought
it
has
nothing
special
i
wont
repeat
much
looks
ok
orange
browned
few
gas
smells
boozy
like
rotten
beer
no
taste
at
all
a
bit
of
alcohol
a
bit
malt
aftertaste
is
like
wooden
flavour
not
bad
option
for
a
can
at
home
is
cheap
probably
wont
buy
again
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
75
overall
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
here
its
nothing
fantastic
that
is
definitely
quaffable
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
or
unique
look
elsewhere
would
choose
others
in
the
style
before
zubr
bison
but
would
drink
it
if
offered
now
for
what
its
worth
my
650
ml
bottle
poured
quite
clear
a
shade
darker
than
the
familiar
pilsner
straw
effervescent
but
not
foamy
a

mouth
surprisingly
caramel
malt
flavor
buttered
toast
orange
marmalade
but
not
that
sweet
a
flick
of
hops
that
seems
less
bitter
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
zest
just
rounding
things
off
a
bit
sticky
feeling
in
the
mouth
substantial
but
moreish
pleasantly
beating
mundane
expectations
o
nothing
fancy
here
standard
flavour

and
fitting
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down

i
wouldnt

side
with

one

not

final
grade

a
b
d
meh
wouldnt
go
for
this
if
i
had
the
choice
overall
another
average
euro
beer
it
would
benefit
from
some
more
hop
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
taste
a
little
bit
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
sweeter
than
most
eastern
block
pilsners
in
both
smell
and
taste
almost
pleasant
certainly
better
than
a
few
ive
tasted
over
the
years
i
expected
bog
stanard
euro
fizz
but
this
a
whole
lot
better
than
that
in
all
aspects
a
traditional
european
lager
grainy
sweet
and
never
been
anywhere
close
to
a
hop
either
wet
or
dry
but
easy
to
drink
and
with
more
flavour
than
a
typical
macro
pils
recognize
zubr
is
polish
but
it
brings
back
memories
of
german
lagers
and
id
certainly
drink
another
one
in
a
pinch
dr
wouldnt
have
it
again
even
at
this
price
range
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
will
100
commit
to
buying
it
again
overall
it
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
i
guess
i
may
have
a
preference
to
beer
in
bottles
find
them
to
be
cleaner
tasting
average
epl
best
part
of
the
beer
is
the
lovely
green
hue
of
the
can
dnot
much
off
here
in
flavor
but
overall
very
nondescript
i
would
not
want
this
beer
again
worth
trying
perhaps
but
not
worth
looking
for
slightly
darker
amber
than
your
average
polish
pilsnertype
with
a
solid
marshmallowy
white
head
with
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
just
one
shade
past
nonexistent
in
the
direction
of
dishwatery
with
a
soapy
lemon
background
and
some
faint
stale
grain
the
flavor
is
significantly
bolder
but
no
less
delicious
corny
and
citric
not
bad
but
tremendously
average
however
i
must
say
it
has
a
nice
lingering
finish
of
sweet
grain
and
tangy
hops
and
the
somewhat
high
alcohol
is
well
hidden
effervescent
carbonation
that
doesnt
get
too
sharp
also
helps
keep
this
nice
and
drinkable
an
agreeable
plainass
eurolager
if
a
bit
lacking
in
balancing
bitterness
but
easy
enough
to
put
back
the
socalled
strong
abv
not
really
a
concern
apparently
zubr
means
bison
in
polish
so
isnt
this
then
actually
called
bison
bison
here
on
ba
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
about
a
1
head
that
went
down
pretty
quick
i
sensed
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
as
well
as
some
bitterness
pretty
good
easy
drinking
beer
a
bit
stronger
that
others
but
overall
not
too
bad
good
beer
and
worth
a
drink
mouthfeel
while
watery
and
refreshing
it
has
a
medium
body
and
creamy
texture
good
carbonation
level
meh
it
was
decent
but
as
one
reviewer
stated
i
expected
more
from
a
czech
brewer
the
appearance
is
clear
gold
with
nice
head
and
lacing
the
smell
was
earthy
with
scents
of
grain
and
malts
even
some
vegetation
smell
the
taste
was
earthy
as
well
with
a
very
grainy
and
grassy
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
didnt
strike
me
as
memorable
it
is
drinkable
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
wont
be
a
return
customer
on
this
one
although
its
a
bit
more
palatable
than
many
of
the
eastern
european
lagers
on
the
local
shelves
these
days
this
is
a
very
pleasant
lager
well
balanced
and
lacking
in
any
off
flavors
perhaps
some
more
hops
would
benefit
this
beer
but
its
quite
quaffable
as
it
is
try
it
it
if
you
come
across
it
a
bit
grainy
for
a
czech
pivo
but
at
this
abv
i
think
it
is
for
the
polish
and
russian
market
wont
buy
again
but
there
are
worse
beer
evils
in
the
world
overall
a
very
mediocre
beer
was
not
impressed
by
the
dry
vegetable
aftertaste
and
there
are
better
beers
in
this
category
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
going
for
it
a
sub
par
strong
lager
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
12
white
head
above
the
clear
bright
golden
brew
head
dwindles
slowly
with
acceptable
lacing
aroma
is
effervescent
and
sweet
in
a
adjunct
sort
of
way
taste
is
the
same
sweetness
upfront
with
a
malt
liquorish
lack
of
hops
character
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
about
what
you
expect
for
the
style
for
better
or
worse
a
reasonable
example
of
what
they
are
trying
to
be
first
taste
is
full
of
nutty
malts
and
alcohol
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
perhaps
but
theres
a
decent
hop
back
to
counteract
a
metallic
acidity
is
in
evidence
as
well
but
its
not
dreadful
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
creamy
and
full
bodied
at
first
leading
to
a
slight
dryness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
drinkable
to
be
sure
but
a
solidly
average
beer
everything
about
it
says
3
0
light
copper
in
colour
with
high
carbonation
aromas
of
sweet
pale
malts
spicy
hops
and
a
bit
of
black
pepper
sweet
and
lightly
toasted
malts
on
the
palate
followed
up
by
some
grassy
and
herbal
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
medium
bodied
with
some
corse
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
a
very
average
eastern
european
lager
although
it
did
finish
fairly
clean
for
its
strength
clear
gold
with
a
bright
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
some
lace
aromas
of
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
dmscooked
veggies
very
light
floralgrassy
hops
theres
a
slight
bitterness
but
theres
more
sweetness
up
front
herbal
and
lightly
citric
hop
flavour
starts
at
the
mid
and
grows
into
the
finish
too
bad
theres
a
bit
of
vegetal
flavour
throughout
light
body
moderate
to
high
carbonation
drying
on
the
palate
a
pretty
basic
sweet
lager
appearance
starts
off
alright
big
fluffy
head
and
a
goldenorange
colour
but
the
head
quickly
disipates
to
nothing
and
the
colour
is
basically
a
shade
too
orange
to
be
urine
smells
of
stale
overcooked
veggies
and
straw
if
their
is
any
hop
profile
i
cant
smell
it
all
i
smell
is
veggies
straw
and
corn
okay
their
is
a
bit
of
hops
i
can
taste
some
lemon
in
the
aftertaste
starts
out
corn
syrup
sweet
with
some
grassy
dryness
leaves
with
a
lemon
flavour
and
overcooked
veggies
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
crisp
and
a
bit
sharp
drinkable
in
that
i
dont
gag
when
i
drink
it
but
otherwise
dont
bother
just
another
anonymous
eurolager
to
me
sweet
and
malty
up
front
light
citrus
hopping
sits
in
the
background
in
the
medium
body
makes
this
a
malt
biased
lager
with
a
wet
biscuity
finish
only
slightly
attenuated
by
light
hopping
normally
id
be
in
malt
heads
bliss
with
this
beer
except
for
one
thing
an
annoying
funky
vegital
taste
that
lurks
just
below
the
malt
profile
my
thinking
is
there
was
a
little
corn
10
in
the
mash
to
get
the
abv
up
to
5
8
too
bad
that
ruins
an
otherwise
malty
lager
my
pour
netted
a
finger
of
fizzing
tawny
head
with
mild
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber

nose
was
very
maltysweet
with
a
hint
of
fusel
alcohol
hmmm
mouthfeel
was
thin
not
necessarily
watery
but
very
lightbodied
and
the
taste
was
very
sweet
almost
sugary
on
the
tongue
the
finish
held
a
little
bit
of
heat
but
it
was
still
mostly
what
i
would
characterize
as
sweet
in
a
beer
this
was
not
my
first
encounter
with
the
style
and
there
are
far
worse
out
there
i
can
assure
you
that
said
i
am
not
recommending
it
either
it
is
another
crappy
style
and
other
than
wanting
to
review
it
from
a
can
one
is
more
than
enough
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
than
anything
else
poured
from
a
brown

9
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch

smell
is
of

some

taste
is
of
alcohol
some
malts
alcohol
a
bit
of
sweetness
more
alcohol
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
nothing
to
recommend
about
this
beer
o
this
beer
isnt
very
tasty
and
you
can
definitely
notice
some
of
the
alcohol
in
the
smell
and
taste
it
is
reminiscent
of
an
american
malt
liquor
this
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
with
eurostrongs
high
abv
with
a
slightly
better
and
more
flavorful
taste
than
say
a
steel
reserve
out
of
a
bottle
i
was
inspired
to
purchase
by
my
attractive
polish
friend
this
polish
beer
was
a
light
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
that
left
spots
of
lacing
briefly
before
the
head
disappeared
completely
the
aroma
was
of
booze
dry
grains
and
bread
the
flavors
were
mostly
of
corn
and
adjunct
grains
booze
dry
grains
and
bread
along
with
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
very
distinct
and
not
much
better
than
an
american
malt
liquor
which
is
a
shame
considering
the
style
euro
strong
lager
can
rise
far
above
that
level
still
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
easy
enough
to
drink
but
nothing
worth
returning
too
pours
a
lifeless
pale
amber
color
no
head
aromas
of
fusel
alcohol
boozy
fruits
stale
grain
and
a
floral
whiff
of
hops
in
the
taste
sugary
sweet
definitely
strong
alcohol
presence
and
dingy
fruits
and
vegetation
some
buttery
diacetyl
is
noticed
a
sloppy
byproduct
of
overworked
lager
yeast
more
alcohol
harsh
grains
and
some
fruityness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
thin
but
with
a
sting
of
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
a
beast
and
only
a
malt
liquor
aficionado
would
i
recommend
this
to
ruby
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
shrinks
to
a
film
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
little
blobs
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
grain
butterscotch
fusel
alcohol
and
green
apple
sweet
candied
corn
and
green
apple
skin
with
a
shot
of
vodka
yikes
wimpy
and
sugary
mouthfeel
with
a
hit
of
alcoholic
warmth
in
the
finish
karpackie
super
is
a
subpar
polish
malt
liquor
at
best
0
a
bit
too
sweet
not
great
not
bad
its
offers
a
cheap
buzz
with
a
drinkable
taste
i
wont
be
drinking
this
too
often
as
it
is
not
widely
available
to
me
a
somewhat
interesting
tipple
much
like
this
brewerys
other
strong
offering
while
maltliquorish
in
the
beginning
it
turns
into
a
fairly
even
if
still
saccharine
affair
hides
the
booze
well
and
is
cheap
with
some
minor
hints
at
greater
aspirations
meh
it
was
less
than
2
and
i
didnt
find
out
until
a
week
later
that
it
was
9
for
over
a
pint
of
brew
once
again
a
brewery
better
than
kalnapilis

d
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again

heavy
slightly
sweet

on

fruits
and
a
bit
of
toast
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
caramel
and
some
faint
green
apple
in
the
finish
as
well
as
some
toasted
malts
medium
bodied
tastes
like
malt
liquor
at
first
then
it
transitions
into
a
sweeter
quality
finishes
like
dark

you
like
sweet
beer

clean
orangeish
yellow
color

off

hints

small
roast
in
the
taste
dry
fruitiness
in
a
standard
european
lager
with
some
boozyness
at
the
end
a
small
bitter
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
fruity
aftertaste
nice
fruitiness
but
a
bit
boozy
karpackie
isnt
super
nor
is
it
duper
if
you
have
extreme
requirements
my
suggestion
is
to
drink
beer
that
is
actually
extreme
this
one
is
instantly
forgettable
and
isnt
worth
the
purchase
price
no
matter
what
it
might
be
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
means
but
since
im
buzzing
only
a
third
of
the
way
through
a
good
choice
when
the
mood
calls
for
a
numbing
of
the
senses
sort
of
astringent
and
undercarbonated
sweet
with
poorly
masked
booze
it
does
remind
me
of
cookies
with
dried
apple
sweet
with
some
odd
spices
maybe
nutmeg
dry
aftertaste
from
the
alcohol
at
1
79
this
might
be
a
better
deal
than
night
train
but
its
about
as
drinkable
i
think
my
curiosity
for
obscure
polish
beers
is
satiated
at
least
for
the

this
is
a
really
poor

style
just
all
around
unbalanced
and
overly

in
flavor
and
pretty
difficult
to
drink
with
the
oddrough
mouthfeel
this
tasted
really
similar
to
apple
cider
with
all
the
fruitiness
it
was
not
a

pour
but
it
was
close
overall
really
impressed
this
tastes
great
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
o
this
is
really
just
a
strong
lager
with
such
a
beer
its
hard
to
mask
the
alcohol
and
sugar
they
have
masked
the
sugar
but
not
the
alcohol
would
not
seek
out
again
oh
my
god
this
is
one
of
the
all
time
worst
beers
i
poured
it
a
bit
too
cold
which
should
have
benefitted
this
but
its
quality
shown
thru
the
beer
reeked
of
sweet
solvents
one
taste
and
i
almost
retched
had
to
dump
it
and
wash
my
mouth
out
if
you
want
somebody
to
leave
your
party
give
them
this
beer
o
meh
as
i
said
i
thought
i
was
buying
the
imperial
lion
stout
i
wont
get
the
pilsner
ever
again
ive
had
so
many
better
and
cheaper
pilsners
perhaps
im
a
little
jaded
or
just
spoiled
after
getting
to
know
the
differences
of
beers
time
was
a
beer
like
this
would
have
been
pretty
high
on
my
list
but
now
after
having
different
styles
a
pilsner
just
doesnt
seem
to
do
it
for
me
anymore
for
what
it
is
its
acceptable
but
then
again
it
ranks
up
there
with
a
run
of
the
mill
grocery
store
brand
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
one
might
be
my
first
euro
strong
lager
so
ill
make
it
the
barsetter
just
tried
lion
imperial
for
the
first
time
and
it
is
the
finest
pilsner
i
have
tasted
sence
leaving
europe
in
1993
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
full
taste
and
body
with
nice
amber
color
the
minute
it
hits
your
mouth
it
brings
back
the
memories
of
what
fine
beer
is
suppose
to
taste
like
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
o
id
try
this
again
who
knew
sri
lanka
made
a
decent
beer
strong
malty
aroma
has
a
sweet
fruity
overtone
and
a
hint
of
honey
it
pours
a
lovely
clear
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
white
head
sweet
malty
flavor
is
almost
like
a
cider
but
has
a
good
alcohol
bite
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
smooth
texture
has
firm
body
but
lacks
fizz
overall
a
nice
robust
pilsner
not
my
favorite
pours
clear
yellow
golden
color
with
a
short
white
head
smells
a
little
off
really
malty
but
extracty
and
sort
of
shallow
some
floral
notes
as
well
flavor
is
strange
and
long
lasting
starts
with
a
bit
of
pale
malts
then
a
one
or
two
second
applejuice
flavor
sweettartsugary
finish
is
clean
but
the
alcohol
comes
out
feel
is
thick
in
te
mouth
even
though
the
beer
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
body
kind
of
syrupy
you
can
also
feel
the
strength
of
this
beer
im
not
waild
about
it
because
it
tastes
off
a
bit
and
the
feel
is
uncomfortable
a
little
bit
not
even
close
to
as
good
as
the
stout
edit
man
the
bottle
is
hella
heavy
a
lot
of
glass
for
class
o
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
covered
up
by
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
this
beer
is
not
great
and
not
bad
not
something
that
will
become
a
regular
in
the
fridge
for
me
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
o
this
beer
definitely
tastes
strong
but
the
ciderlike
sweetness
helps
to
cover
up
the
alcohol
although
it
seems
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
lion
imperial
premium
malt
pilsner
a
product
of
sri
lanka
with

alcohol
by
volume
it
poured
a
mighty
orange
much
like
the
lion
on
its
label
with
a
small
sudsy
white
head
the
smell
was
mild
faintly
sweet
malts
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
was
again
mild
a
bit
of
apple
grassy
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
alcohol
was
just
slightly
noticeable
it
was
smooth
mellow
light
and
crisp
not
offensive
but
not
super
flavorful
fairly
wellbalanced
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
d
not
a
fan
of
this
one
its
abv
is
apparent
although
this
doesnt
affect
my
review
it
lacks
any
distinguished
flavors
and
its
not
sessionable
not
an
ideal
light
lager
or
pilsner
i
guess
o
an
odd
tasting
malt
pilsner
i
will
not
seek
out
again
characteristics
of
cider
unless
you
seek
this
style
i
would
not
recommend
finished
the
bottle
and
wont
be
returning

o
not
very
good
ive
had
one
of
their
other
beers
and
thought
that
that
was
what
i
was
getting
i
was
wrong
and
man
am
i
disappointed
in
this
its
overly
fruity
and
just
not
that
good
it
was
just
above
a

faint
peppery
hop
notes
get
lost
among
the
sweet
boozy
malts
moderate
to
light
body
with
a
very
dry
feel
in
the
finish
warming
and
not
really
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
for
the
style
its
not
bad
but
this
is
not
a
style
i
am
crazy
about
pours
a
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
no
retention
lacing
and
moderate
carbonation
the
nose
consists
of
some
sweet
malts
honey
comes
to
mind
some
grains
and
alcohol
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
strong
sweet
honey
taste
and
than
the
alcohol
hits
hard
i
can
barely
taste
the
hops
in
this
beer
this
beer
has
too
much
sweetness
to
it
that
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
semidry
and
overall
this
beer
has
no
balance
and
not
much
to
offer
in
a
beer
this
is
a
drain
pour
beer
not
something
i
would
expect
from
ceylonlion
brewery
got
this
through
my
beer
of
the
month
club
would
not
seek
out
when
i
think
of
what
an
imperial
anything
should
be
to
me
it
should
be
more
of
the
best
parts
of
the
style
this
isnt
o
pretty
darn
awful
the
vegetable
flavor
wasnt
as
bad
after
a
while
but
i
ended
up
pouring
more
than
half
of
the
bottle
down
the
drain
avoid
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
for
me
as
i
can
enjoy
brews
on
the
sweeter
end
of
the
spectrum
nothing
fantastic
and
i
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
it
out
again
but
i
didnt
find
the
experience
deplorable
either
this
is
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
damn
close
had
the
lion
stout
which
i
think
i
liked
but
this
is
awfull
apperence
looks
like
beer
everyting
else
omg
could
be
drinking
100
times
better
worst
beer
ive
reviewed
so
far
almost
undrinkable
but
can
finish
if
i
try
real
hard
m
fairly
carbonated
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
strtong
flavors
and
the
high
abv
make
this
a
beer
something
to
enjoy
in
moderation
only
o
this
beer
is
dinkable
enough
if
you
get
past
the
sweetness
but
im
not
really
inclinded
to
try
an
imperial
pilsner
interesting
appearance
is
not
your
usual
high
yellow
leans
to
the
bronze
side
smells
sweet
a
bit
aromatic
taste
not
a
typical
pilsner
malty
and
sweet
with
alcohol
finish
almost
like
a
cider
mouthfeel
smooth
despite
the
high
alcohol
fairly
easy
to
drink
overall
above
average
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
ive
come
to
respect
the
ceylon
peeps
for
putting
out
good
beer
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
body
has
an
odd
syrup
texture
about
it
but
is
not
sticky
at
all
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
bread
and
lemons
the
flavor
is
grain
and
bready
malt
fairy
bland
and
not
near
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
from
an
imperial
pilsner
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
that
really
stands
out
not
a
bad
effort
from
sri
lanka
smooth
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
lighter
effervescence
than
expected
warming
with
a
slight
green
apple
note
in
the
finish
a
much
better
brew
than
i
expected
or
than
the
nose
was
told
id
have
another
but
not
breathe
it
in
too
much
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
when
getting
into
another
style
you
conclude
that
either
its
a
bad
example
of
the
style
or
that
style
is
just
not
for
you
im
hoping
the
former
because
ive
had
malt
liquors
that
were
better
than
this
lion
imperial
pilsner
is
a
dense
crystal
clear
golden
lager
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
and
leaves
good
lacing
it
has
a
very
faint
aroma
of
cardboard
and
grass
its
medium
bodied
and
very
lively
the
finish
is
sharp
and
it
leaves
the
mouth
chalky
its
quite
sweet
and
not
bitter
enough
to
balance
things
out
its
tangy
with
a
little
noble
hop
character
there
are
no
off
flavors
but
its
not
refined
its
very
drinkable
for
8
8
abv
theres
no
alcohol
flavor
it
could
serve
as
a
session
beer
but
things
could
get
out
of
hand
if
it
did
lion
imperial

a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
the
flavor
is
also
sweet
and
malty
alcohol
is
a
bit
evident
but
i
didnt
find
it
overpowering
not
bad
for
what
it
is
actually
a
bit
better
than
i
expected
d
8
8
alcohol
and
you
can
tell
wow
really
strong
but
very
enjoyable
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
may
be
enjoyable
but
i
would
probably
reach
first
for
something
with
more
intriguing
flavor
obviously
an
infected
bottle
i
cant
remember
where
i
picked
this
up
but
it
was
in
a
make
your
own
6pack
and
sat
in
my
fridge
for
5
months
so
guessing
shelf
life
is
well
past
its
prime
still
if
lion
had
better
sanitary
practices
this
could
have
been
avoided
how
do
you

how
novel
kind
of
like
this
ceylonian
imperial
lager
do
not
mistake
this
for
another
stout
from

as
i
did
ill
reiterate
too
sweet

still
if
there
is
one
attribute
that
sets
this
one
apart
from

its

you
thought
we
were
gonna
say
the
higher

this
beer
has

it
makes
it
that
much
more
enjoyable
pair
it
with
chicken
cutlets
with
linguini
in
alfredo
sauce
im
nt
a
big
pilsner
fan
this
was
a
good
beer
however
im
not
sure
it
belongs
in
the
imperial
pilsner
class
you
can
call
this
an
imperial
pilsner
but
malt
liquor
is
malt
liquor
and
this
belongs
in
that
category
heavy
malt
sweet
with
pungent
biting
alcohol
noted
at
every
turn
while
better
than
the
convenience
store
brown
bagworth
offerings
this
is
really
not
that
much
of
a
step
up
d
this
one
surprised
me
it
has
a
sort
of
unexpected
complexity
to
it
even
for
a
simple
style
the
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
but
its
got
some
flavor
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
a
must
try
if
not
just
for
the
style
strong
malt
taste
slightly
sweet
and
hoppy
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
taste
mouthfeel
was
more
pleasant
than
the
taste
light
and
fairly
smooth
not
a
great
brew
but
certainly
one
that
i
would
drink
regularly
if
the
price
was
right
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
folks
who
prefer
high
acohol
content
beers
very
drinkable
minus
the
obvious
flaws
in
character
for
the
style
and
fairly
sweet
not
the
best
ip
ive
had
but
its
still
tasty
and
overall
pleasant
and
for
5
a
bottle
at
my
for
the
most
part
a
bit
pricey
bar
thats
not
a
bad
deal
at
all
been
on
kind
of
a
can
kick
lately
as
i
really
enjoy
drinking
from
a
can
and
i
honestly
think
the
beer
keeps
much
better
that
said
i
was
attracted
to
this
one
the
other
day
when
i
was
putting
together
a
mixed
sixer
and
said
what
the
hell
i
actually
thought
it
was
an
imperial
stout
black
can
big
word
imperial
8
8
abv
so
imagine
my
surprise
when
it
poured
out
a
brilliant
yellow
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
kinda
like
a
good
malt
liqour
a
little
grainy
somewhat
sweet
and
really
not
a
whole
lot
to
recommend
although
id
probably
drink
it
again
rather
drinkable
though
at
8
8
you
better
watch
what
youre
doing
if
youre
having
more
than
two
of
these
especially
if
youre
camping
drinkability
is
pretty
low
i
couldnt
even
finish
this
one
wound
up
dumping
about
half
of
it
down
the
drain
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelf
keep
on
going
i
have
another
one
cellared
for
a
few
years
down
the
road
ill
be
sure
to
update
my
review
when
i
crack
it
open
drinkability
the
most
bizarre
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
the
brewers
were
trying
to
accomplish
drinkability
the
first
half
is
indeed
much
more
drinkable
then
the
second
half
cheers
i
have
to
say
im
disappointed
overall
with
the
lion
imperial
premium
malt
pilsner
knowing
lion
brewery
limiteds
reputation
for
great
beers
i
really
wanted
to
give
this
beer
a
standing
ovation
perhaps
their
stout
ruined
me
as
its
one
of
the
highest
rated
beers
in
the
world
and
for
good
reason
but
i
would
not
recommend
the
pils
to
a
friend
you
can
get
just
as
drunk
from
camo
or
hurricane
for
about
20
of
the
price
while
not
compromising
much
on
taste
if
the
purpose
of
your
purchase
is
to
enjoy
the
beer
as
mine
was
then
dont
choose
this
one
first
impressionappearance
aromais
a
typical
if
slightly
above
average
pilsner
the
flavor
is
fairly
dry
and
not
particularly
complex
but
theres
a
nice
malt
sweetness
and
subtle
hop
bite
the
most
impressive
element
is
how
well
the
8
8
abv
is
hidden
i
could
drink
a
second
one
of
these
more
easily
than
say
a
second
bud
light
the
strength
is
catching
up
to
me
as
i
write
this
though
so
perhaps
its
for
the
best
that
i
only
had
one
on
hand
1
50
each
at
whole
foods
this
is
a
little
expensive
for
what
it
is
but
it
is
worth
a
try
it
pours
a
clean
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aromas
of
pear
citrus
melon
and
palate
that
matches
the
palate
is
lightly
fruity
with
flavors
of
pear
and
melon
and
has
a
slight
bit
of
sweetness
which
you
never
find
on
a
pilsner
the
higher
abv
was
noticable
but
not
over
the
top
with
the
alcohol
flavor
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
mild
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
like
the
smell
alcohol
with
some
malts
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
overall
this
offering
is
mediocre
at
best
this
was
without
a
doubt
the
biggest
waste
of
money
i
have
ever
spent
congrats
to
the
marketing
team
for
thier
impressive
label
to
the
brew
master
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
at
first
sip
you
will
realise
you
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
i
would
rank
this
beer
somewhere
around
rhinelander
and
colt
45
drinkability
eh
i
see
and
have
heard
a
few
comparisons
to
malt
liquor
and
while
its
not
quite
that
bad
its
not
that
much
better
either
hot
alcohol
would
make
it
tough
to
pound
back
more
than
one
of
these
d
overall
considering
the
abv
i
must
say
that
this
brew
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
still
not
what
i
would
call
a
session
beer
but
definitely
a
good
beer
that
i
wont
have
a
problem
picking
up
again
overall
a
tasty
and
different
take
on
the
pilsner
style
the
aroma
and
taste
are
mainly
apples
and
bread
all
the
bad
reviews
are
really
misleading
while
pilsners
arent
my
favorite
style
i
find
myself
enjoying
this
one
if
you
like
your
beers
big
then
check
this
one
out
d
certainly
not
the
best
pilsner
but
for
a
sri
lankan
brewer
i
was
happy
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
would
search
for
alternatives
first
for
10
youd
be
much
better
off
getting
something
with
a
more
definite
character
the
finish
is
obviously
high
gravity
and
brings
out
some
tingle
drinkable
yes
but
not
specttacuar
though
i
like
the
can
concept
mouthfeeldrinkability
slick
and
frothy
it
crackles
slightly
and
remains
full
the
overall
heaviness
in
taste
and
texture
would
keep
me
from
choosing
this
before
an
alternate
choice
meh
not
anything
to
spectacular
with
this
muted
messy
brew
that
seems
to
stretch
quietly
into
a
belgian
style
rather
then
a
dbl
pils
it
needs
some
balancing
help
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
hops
pale
malt
yeast
and
very
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
american
double
imperial
pilsner
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
pale
malt
slight

and

overall
much
too
much
yeast
and
grainadjunct
flavor
for
my
taste
d
stay
away
from
this
shit
dont
waste
your
money
on
it
horrible
beer
thats
about
to
be
a
drain
pour
stay
away
would
not
suggest
this
beer
to
others
and
will
avoid
in
the
future
yuck
picked
this
up
by
mistake
as
i
meant
to
grab
their
fairly
decent
stout
this
is
not
in
the
same
ballpark
pours
golden
with
a
thick
head
that
very
quickly
fades
to
nearly
nothing
smells
like
rubbing
alcohol
with
some
very
late
graininess
nothing
like
a
nice
whiff
of
solvent
to
wake
your
appetite
up
for
the
beer
that
follows
tastes
similar
which
is
bad
makes
my
eyes
water
from
what
seems
to
be
a
shot
of
cheap
vodka
more
than
it
is
a
beer
not
even
any
hint
of
the
grain
this
time
not
that
really
helped
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
harsh
and
chemical
feeling
and
to
me
this
whole
beer
is
undrinkable
drain
pour
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
but
it
is
intriguing
to
the
point
where
i
would
give
the
brewery
another
try
overall
i
regularly
enjoy
the
lion
stout
and
since
its
been
years
i
dont
recall
if
ive
had
the
imperial
lager
before
or
if
it
was
the
regular
lager
either
way
its
my
first
lion
experience
from
a
can
not
a
terrible
beer
id
maybe
compare
it
with
rogues
dads
little
helper
its
tough
category
in
which
to
really
wow
somebody
keeping
8
8
drinkable
in
a
lager
is
tough
to
do
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
potent
punch
im
somewhat
unfamiliar
with
the
euro
strong
lager
classification
but
this
is
probably
most
similar
to
a
maibock
and
when
compared
to
examples
of
this
style
i
think
it
stands
up
well
it
would
be
even
better
if
the
aroma
was
improved
light
transparent
in
body
terrible
aromas
in
the
nose
hops
bad
water
and
subtle
fruit
flavors
are
acidic
candied
sugar
burnt
sugar
alcoholic
scorch
very
cloying
on
the
palate
tastes
like
a
40
oz
id
buy
in
the
slums
of
sri
lanka
not
an
enjoyable
experience
d
read
the
end
of
mouthfeel
this
is
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
biggest
reason
it
doesnt
get
a
higher
drinkability
rating
is
the
alcohol
presence
though
mild
for
a
high
abv
it
is
enough
to
slow
you
down
and
really
enjoy
this
brew
d
not
actually
bad
just
funky
how
can
lion
stout
be
so
awesome
and
this
us
so
meh
this
was
such
a
great
botm
shipment
until
i
had
this
future
outlook
seems
like
lion
only
does
a
few
beers
but
they
do
them
quite
well
moderate
price
fantastic
taste
and
feel
make
repeat
purchase
and
consumption
likely
notes
a
strong
lager
as
indicated
and
while
it
was
not
top
notch
it
was
boozy
and
still
a
bit
refreshing
i
would
not
have
too
many
but
it
was
decent
enough
lion
imperial
lagers
an
okay
beer
its
probably
above
average
overall
im
reminded
of
my
recent
experience
with
cisk
xs
extra
lager
which
was
horrendous
and
believe
this
is
a
much
better
take
on
a
euro
strong
lager
this
ones
not
quite
good
but
its
not
the
worst
out
there
fix
that
funky
nose
and
itd
improve
quite
a
bit
not
exactly
recommended
but
you
can
do
worse
mfd
decent
mouthfeel
light
body
no
complexity
but
those
sour
notes
just
kill
this
beer
for
me
im
not
sure
if
it
is
past
due
or
not
but
this
is
not
good
at
all
this
beer
is
wrong
just
wrong
i
drank
a
few
sips
for
this
review
and
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
i
hate
to
be
a
killjoy
but
i
have
to
be
with
this
beer
what
exactly
is
going
on
i
thought
lion
knew
what
they
were
doing
their
stout
is
a
very
good
beer
why
is
this
one
so
horrible
this
tastes
budweiser
with
the
water
iced
out
completely
there
is
a
definite
strong
smell
and
taste
but
not
one
i
could
call
great
jet
feul
is
the
smell
half
rotten
corn
is
the
other
i
think
that
there
might
really
be
some
hops
somewhere
or
other
in
here
but
i
certainly
am
not
the
man
to
find
them
the
appearance
is
decent
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
neither
is
anything
special
and
those
two
are
this
beers
only
shining
points
way
too
hot
not
blended
at
all
my
least
favorite
beer
of
all
time
not
really
d
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
and
imperial
lager
from
sri
lanka
like
this
blows
my
mind
the
aroma
is
alcoholic
with
flowers
and
sweet
malt
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
large
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
is
also
like
fuel
from
the
alcohol
this
beer
does
not
try
to
hid
the
alcohol
in
any
way
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
bad
stuff
this
is
like
a
malt
liquor
only
better
than
oe
or
colt
45
because
it
lacks
corn
taste
and
has
some
flowery
hops
best
for
a
summers
day
not
a
cold
day
in
michigan
interesting
but
wont
have
another
theres
a
great
beer
in
here
somewhere
this
is
my
first
euro
strong
lager
and
i
like
the
concept
just
as
i
do
the
imperial
pils
concept
but
this
needs
some
cleaning
up
mostly
in
the
alcohol
department
as
for
the
floaters
ive
got
a
few
more
of
these
so
ill
adjust
score
accordingly
in
the
future
if
necessary
addendum
not
necessary
they
all
had
sea
monkeys
bottle
from
college
liquors
in
grand
junction
co
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
bubbly
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
skunky
corn
and
grains
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
full
of
sweet
corn
and
other
adjuncts
a
sour
mash
and
skunked
flavor
im
not
sure
how
fresh
this
was
but
it
was
just
a
ok
lager
d
even
with
a
high
abv
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
lager
the
alcohol
does
show
a
bit
but
is
reasonably
wellcovered
it
has
a
refreshing
quality
despite
the
alcohol
a
welldone
eurostrong
lager
imo
a
wellbalanced
sipping
lager
drinkability
is
low
the
flavors
in
this
brew
are
terrible
and
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
quite
a
stretch
from
their
stout
which
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
murder
this
is
dark
gold
with
a
big
offwhite
head
slowly
shirnking
to
lave
a
hint
of
lace
the
aroma
is
bread
grapes
wine
riesling
esp
hint
of
meat
in
a
manner
common
to
higher
alcohol
lagers
malt
liquors
and
some
wee
heavies
raisins
fruit
candy
its
sweet
fruity
spciey
zesty
with
bread
and
fresh
waffles
being
the
main
traits
along
with
grapes
it
has
a
nice
light
hop
quality
to
balance
the
malt
body
with
grassy
apple
peel
its
very
nice
quite
flavourful
and
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
in
body
though
not
as
light
as
a
light
lager
carbonation
is
pretty
coarse
and
is
lower
than
i
expected
finish
is
dry
there
is
no
reason
to
come
back
to
this
beer
i
am
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
this
barter
for
it
trade
for
it
waste
my
time
trying
to
decide
if
i
wanted
to
drink
it
waste
my
time
making
a
decision
to
buytradebartersteal
this
it
was
given
to
me
so
i
took
it
ill
only
try
this
one
more
time
and
that
would
be
because
after
tasting
this
i
believe
that
this
bottle
is
quite
old
d
good
but
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
better
batch
d
eh
not
bad
but
not
great
a
lot
like
a
hopped
malt
liquor
too
sweet
and
cloying
with
a
very
one
dimensional
hop
balance
resulting
in
a
severely
unbalanced
brew
put
out
cause
they
are
too
cheap
to
give
up
corn
and
rice
pours
a
ark
strawgold
yellow
with
a
rocky
white
head
i
get
some
kind
of
funk
in
the
aromai
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
am
getting
some
hop
aroma
through
the
funk
tasting
the
beer
i
get
little
hop
character
and
not
much
more
maltwhat
malt
i
get
is
slightly
sweet
carbonation
is
light
to
mediumwhich
translates
to
a
nice
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
oki
would
love
to
try
this
on
tapor
in
sri
lankai
could
drink
a
few
of
these
with
some
sri
lankan
foodbut
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
thisi
think
i
will
stick
with
their
stout
one
was
enough
for
me
decent
brew
for
the
price
but
didnt
match
the
greatness
of
lions
stout
drinkability
is
just
ok
i
wont
pour
the
other
five
down
the
drain
but
this
beer
just
lacks
a
hop
punch
or
a
pilsners
complexity
think
i
will
stick
to
lions
stout
from
now
on
this
is
fairly
drinkable
as
far
as
flavor
and
enjoyability
but
the
abv
catches
up
to
you
pretty
quickly
overall
this
was
interesting
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
high
alcohol
and
the
eventually
cloying
sweetness
sri
lanka
yayuh
not
much
to
say
orangish
gold
color
like
subtle
urine
on
a
warm
afternoon
impressive
white
head
that
lasted
a
good
bit
faint
smell
of
hops
and
alcohol
taste
is
little
hoppy
sweet
light
malty
some
booty
also
medium
to
light
bodied
smoothe
as
eggs
an
alright
brew
d
definitly
not
a
session
lager
has
a
big
sweet
butterycitric
flavor
that
makes
this
drink
like
a
macro
in
the
beginning
but
the
big
hoppy
nature
in
the
finish
gives
it
some
credit
worth
a
try
but
not
a
sixpack
redcommended
this
isnt
a
particularly
drinkable
beer
its
thin
and
a
little
too
straightforward
it
does
have
a
decently
high
abv
if
youre
looking
to
get
wasted
my
brother
brought
a
six
pack
over
while
we
watched
the
lions
thats
why
he
bought
lion
lager
kick
the
hell
out
of
the
denver
broncos
he
didnt
much
care
for
this
beer
thought
it
was
ok
i
disagree
i
like
strong
beers
yet
among
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
is
lager
which
usually
isnt
even
close
to
8
0
alcohol
so
i
was
interested
in
trying
this
its
got
a
decent
orangish
gold
color
with
a
small
head
i
like
the
smell
it
reminds
me
of
german
marzens
heavy
and
rich
malt
aroma
i
detect
a
hint
of
cereallike
grain
too
taste
reflects
the
smell
alcohol
presence
is
obvious
and
warm
a
good
lager
beer
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
nice
consistency
and
carbonation
a
good
slowdrinking
2
or
3
beer
beer
good
beer
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
would
still
rather
just
have
a
good
ol
normal
pilsner
or
lager
than
some
superstrong
version
i
was
hoping
that
lion
imperial
lager
would
be
as
good
as
lion
stout
a
fantastic
beer
but
a
quick
glance
at
the
average
score
led
me
to
expect
otherwise
beer
of
this
sort
is
hard
to
like
because
a
high
abv
seems
to
be
priority
number
one
having
said
that
considering
the
style
one
could
do
a
whole
lot
worse
pours
a
clean
deep
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
european
hops
and
small
amount
of
alcohol
a
dry
beer
with
a
big
presence
of
alcohol
it
has
a
bigger
body
than
most
lagers
but
a
very
clean
end
it
seems
to
hide
the
alcohol
quite
well
a
tad
earthy
as
well
a
nice
lager
for
a
chilly
fall
night
d
its
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
but
its
be
an
excellent
beer
for
your
macro
drinking
buddies
especially
if
they
were
hot
members
of
the
opposite
sex
it
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
8
typical
of
most
higher
gravity
lagers
opens
with
a
considerably
viscous
pour
that
released
a
loosely
knit
foamstand
that
faltered
quickly
over
the
abundant
alcohols
rich
sweet
pilsner
malt
aroma
and
earthy
hop
additions
rose
sharply
out
of
the
glass
giving
light
apple
lemon
and
grassy
scents
tastes
very
sweet
with
sweet
alcohols
thinning
the
taste
somewhat
and
numbing
the
palate
herbal
tealike
flavors
combine
with
lemon
grass
and
noble
hop
flavors
help
to
round
out
the
beer
but
can
hardly
combat
the
maltliquorlike
sweetness
feels
weightier
than
most
lagers
with
a
light
oily
texture
and
alcohol
dryness
finishes
sweet
dry
and
with
that
earthy
lemon
grass
flavor
interesting
and
adventurous
cannot
say
that
this
beer
is
of
hight
quality
but
not
a
disapointment
either
this
seems
to
be
a
little
more
civilized
malt
liquor
quite
sweet
and
pretty
strong
but
without
the
nasty
notes
that
come
up
with
the
high
gravity
malt
liquorsbut
maybe
thats
because
this
is
in
a
330ml
bottle
and
not
a
40oz
this
brew
poured
a
beautiful
deep
golden
almost
orange
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
the
nose
is
flowery
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
lemongrass
the
moment
you
drink
it
your
tastebuds
begin
to
dance
with
sweet
malty
goodness
of
vanilla
plum
lemongrass
and
cherry
flavors
the
finish
lingers
on
the
malt
flavors
which
is
perfectly
balanced
by
the
moderate
hoppy
bitterness
very
smooth
due
to
its
lager
style
but
watch
out
with
the
8
0abv
this
beer
is
a
real
gem
an
alright
imperial
lager
nothing
real
amazing
but
better
than
bad
m
light
carbonation
with
a
crisp
feel
on
the
tongue
the
alcohol
domination
made
this
beer
unpleasent
to
enjoy
i
really
think
i
would
of
enjoyed
what
this
beer
brought
to
the
table
but
i
could
not
get
beyond
the
rubbing
alcohol
taste
in
my
mouth
in
the
spirit
of
trying
to
be
fair
i
must
say
i
think
i
have
a
bent
away
from
really
high
avb
beers
the
exception
being
chimay
beers
i
think
this
is
going
to
one
of
those
lovehate
type
beers
i
think
i
was
expecting
some
kind
of
american
macro
knockoff
think
kingfisher
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
could
be
wrong
but
this
seemed
like
an
allmalt
lager
to
me
it
had
a
bit
of
sweetness
more
than
say
a
s
a
boston
lager
but
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
the
appearance
was
robust
almost
cloudy
and
the
head
while
rather
thin
fizzy
opened
up
to
reveal
a
somewhat
substantial
smell
again
perhaps
relative
to
what
i
was
expecting
fruity
decent
bitterness
comments
would
not
buy
it
again
mediumfull
bodied
seems
a
bit
underattenuated
but
not
a
bad
offering
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
does
not
at
all
detract
from
the
taste
at
first
i
quite
liked
the
way
it
drank
but
as
i
drink
it
more
my
opinion
is
changing
a
bit
not
as
smooth
and
wellrounded
as
id
like
more
hop
presence
would
do
this
some
good
glad
i
split
it
even
then
we
were
unable
to
finish
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
and
i
am
not
sure
where
this
one
falls
in
the
mix
but
this
might
not
be
a
style
for
me
mild
flavor
inoffensive
again
tea
like
sweet
and
grainy
mild
bitterness
pleasant
aftertaste
slightly
caramelly

this
imported
russian
beer
gave
me
very
little
expectation
however
compared
to
many
of
the
lowpriced
quantity
over
quality
beers
of
the
u
s
this
beer
is
very
well
done
much
more
enjoyable
than
a
32oz
of
pabst
mgd
or
any
coorsbud
product
overall
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
good
a
cheap
buzz
with
a
tolerable
and
decent
taste
it
is
really
really
sweet
though
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
lots
of
carbonation
evident
and
the
pour
produced
a
rocky
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
beautiful
deep
goldenyellow
nose
had
a
juicyfruit
bubble
gumlike
quality
mouthfeel
was
thin
just
above
watery
with
a
powerful
grapeyfruity
taste
in
the
mouth
oof
it
was
not
as
pronounced
as
in
a
minhas
offering
but
it
was
mighty
dang
close
it
had
a
mild
fusel
heat
to
accompany
the
fruitness
as
though
to
add
to
the
well
i
wont
say
unpleasantness
but
it
was
not
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
either
finish
left
a
dry
cloying
taste
in
my
mouth
and
i
knew
that
it
was
a
harbinger
of
the
headachehangover
to
come
it
was
cheap
it
was
paid
for
and
i
wanted
a
beer
for
the
hockey
games
so
it
was
not
too
bad
in
total
i
would
not
recommend
it
as
a
casual
drink
but
as
an
intriguing
beer
it
might
be
worth
a
try
i
spent
an
evening
with
it
in
total
watching
hockey
so
as
an
accompaniment
to
sports
it
makes
it
otherwise
dont
bother
only
drink
this
to
get
drunk
not
to
savor
it
it
beats
out
40oz
of
bmc
in
that
regard
and
it
was
cheaper
overall
not
bad
not
great
if
you
like
your
drinks
a
little
sweet
malty
and
russian
then
this
is
for
you
arsenalnoye
krepkoye
is
a
slightly
hazy
golden
lager
with
a
thin
white
head
that
vanishes
instantly
it
has
a
very
sweet
aroma
like
malt
extract
and
maybe
corn
syrup
its
medium
bodied
dusty
and
gritty
with
a
watery
finish
it
tastes
very
sweet
like
malt
extract
in
water
i
cant
really
taste
the
booze
though
this
51
oz
bottle
is
trouble
i
knew
it
from
the
moment
i
saw
it
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
the
bottle
is
plastic
which
isnt
very
effective
in
a
brawl
i
just
see
that
as
a
reasonable
safety
precaution
drinkability
an
overly
sweet
euro
lager
that
is
typical
of
this
brewery
not
bad
but
probably
nothing
i
am
going
to
try
again
worth
trying
once
overall
considering
that
i
am
able
to
get
this
stuff
at
a
local
liquor
store
for
0
99
per
half
liter
bottle
and
mainly
care
about
the
last
three
categories
this
is
a
tremendous
buy
for
me
experienced
beer
drinkers
will
likely
consider
this
beer
to
be
average
but
many
inexperienced
drinkers
will
find
this
to
be
a
delight
nothing
fancy
but
drinkable
for
a
beer
that
is
7
this
goes
down
rather
easy
this
beer
is
not
terrible
but
i
would
most
likely
not
purchase
it
again
a
little
too
sweet
most
likely
in
an
attempt
to
hide
the
7
alcohol
there
are
better
export
lagers
available
drinkability
oddly
it
is
not
too
bad
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
there
are
no
traces
of
the
increased
alcohol
or
any
hops
its
clean
and
crisp
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
rich
malty
flavor
despite
its
pale
profile
its
quite
sweet
throughout
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
euro
lager
its
way
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
guess
it
gets
the
job
done
for
people
looking
for
a
quick
buzz
d
pretty
average
overall
not
that
bad
actually
rather
surprised
in
fact
but
still
just
ok
essentially
malt
liquor
but
not
all
that
bad
coppery
leaning
toward
amber
with
a
shortlived
head
a
little
thin
and
astringent
at
first
but
some
lightly
sugared
malt
flavor
follows
thins
out
a
bit
again
toward
the
end
with
a
pleasingly
clean
finish
alcohol
does
not
do
much
to
announce
itself
although
you
can
detect
a
touch
of
fusel
alcohol
if
you
try
overall
one
of
the
better
in
this
class
that
ive
had
an
opportunity
to
try
and
better
than
any
us
counterpart
malt
liquor
the
taste
was
better
than
a
skunked
beer
but
not
by
much
it
tasted
like
a
low
quality
vodka
mixed
with
beer
i
even
gagged
on
the
first
gulp
and
my
girlfriend
thought
that
it
was
like
a
traditional
national
american
lager
though
i
think
i
would
rather
drink
a
miller
lite
over
this
one
i
would
never
drink
this
beer
again
nor
would
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
else
anyway
light
on
flavor
and
heavy
on
alcohol
absolutely
nothing
impressive
but
its
drinkable
wasnt
stinky
or
nasty
just
not
all
that
great
if
i
was
in
russsia
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
in
the
absence
of
anything
better
fortunately
i
am
able
to
get
much
better
beer
and
i
will

id
pour
this
down
the
sink
except
that
farmers
threatened

my
homeowners
insurance
a
clean
yellowgolden
yellow
beer
has
a
big
foamy
bright
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
lace
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
grass
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
light
biscuit
malt
in
the
background
the
flavor
starts
with
a
strong
rush
of
alcohol
into
your
mouth
followed
by
a
light
malt
sweet
and
a
light
hop
pricklyness
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
pours
a
slightly
darker
shade
of
gold
with
a
big
fizzy
head
that
disappears
quickly
there
is
however
some
lace
clinging
to
the
side
here
the
smell
is
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
rust
whereas
the
mouth
is
a
bit
heavy
the
initial
taste
is
a
touch
sour
alcohol
kicking
in
as
we
head
towards
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
sour
i
cant
find
any
hops
here
still
it
is
not
repulsive
as
many
russian
strong
beers
are
decent
brew
that
packs
a
punch
overall
im
going
to
just
echo
what
ive
heard
and
thats
to
just
try
it
yourself
its
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
and
thats
both
a
good
and
a
bad
thing
typical
russian
malt
lager
over
here
it
comes
in
pop
bottles
i
detect
a
faint
taste
of
raisins
to
go
with
the
alcohol
in
all
honesty
sounds
bad
looks
average
but
the
taste
is
unique
worth
it
to
try
and
see
if
you
like
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
typical
offwhite
head
not
impressive
but
this
is
a
pale
lager
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
and
has
a
hint
of
fruit
flavor
is
malty
just
a
touch
fruity
not
much
more
texture
has
decent
fizz
but
body
leaves
something
to
be
desired
fair
to
middlin
leaning
towards
fair
its
a
russian
classic
that
everyone
should
try
once
poor
hate
tht
crap
dont
buy
this
beer
came
it
a
handsome
can
which
led
me
to
believe
it
would
be
better
than
it
is
i
would
probably
rate
it
lower
if
i
were
more
familiar
with

a

taste
was
somewhat

and
ultimately
unredeeming
this
beer
even
with

high
abv
is
pretty
disappointing
large
bottle
does
well
for
sharing
if
youre
into
that
thing
not
really
worth
the
time
i
dont
really
care
for
this
beer
because
of
the
weak
taste
paired
with
high
alcohol
content
its
ok
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
more
surprised
the
general
rating
is
low
somewhat
sweet
taste
and
the
abv
balance
is
nice
light
color
but
bold
taste
o
there
is
some
crispness
but
the
higher
abv
reduces
the
lightness
of
the
lager
style
taste
well
nothing
thrilling
here
toasted
biscuit
malts
sweet
caramel
some
hop
notes
but
generally
pretty
boring
definitely
not
the
kind
of
strong
ale
i
prefer
to
drink
although
i
do
feel
like
listening
to
to
anya
muzafaroza
music
of
the
rain
as
i
drink
it
poured
from
a
51
oz
plastic
bottle
yes
you
read
that
correctly
pours
murky
gold
with
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
notes
of
musty
grapes
the
taste
is
sugary
sweet
with
light
grain
and
more
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
well
carbed
with
thick
body
overall
this
brew
is
an
experience
not
necessarily
good
unfortunately
ive
found
nothing
but
skunked
excuses
for
this
beer
in
the
occasional
bottle
i
find
on
the
shelf
after
three
or
four
tries
ive
all
but
given
up
maybe
its
just
guaranteed
to
be
fresher
at
a
bar
pours
a
medium
light
amber
with
a
strong
head
lots
of
carbonation
slightly
sweet
aroma
and
an
even
sweeter
taste
lots
of
carbonation
and
quite
frankly
not
bad
its
got
a
nice
medium
flavor
that
goes
down
pretty
good
not
sure
what
the
negative
reviews
are
about
but
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
o
other
than
being
a
strong
beer
it
really
does
not
have
much
going
on
for
it

i
bought
this
on
a
whim
for
a
beer
tasting
that
i
was
having
the
reason
i
bought
this
is
because
for
3
bones
i
was
able
to
get
75
oz
of
beer
in
a
large
brown
textured
plastic
bottle
the
bottle
has
been
textured
so
it
reminds
me
of
bad
plaster
work
the
kicker
about
this
beer
is
that
it
was
exactly
1
year
out
of
date
when
i
bought
it
i
went
up
to
the
front
of
the
store
to
ask
about
it
and
was
informed
that
they
had
just
received
it
no
dust
on
the
bottle
and
everything
they
get
from
that
brewer
comes
that
old
on
to
the
review
poured
the
first
glass
into
my
chimay
chalice
this
beer
looks
like
someone
fermented
dirty
dishwater
slightly
murky
with
no
carbonation
i
definitely
think
that
the
plastic
bottle
made
it
impossible
to
hold
the
carbonation
for
this
long
aroma
is
really
sweet
yeastiness
this
is
a
decent

this

is
nothing

first
thing
you
notice
with

the

sweetness
followed
by
a

wasnt

brew
and
i
wasnt
suprised
by
the

the
only
saving

of

54this
isnt
bad
i
have
certainly
had
worse
packetknife
smell
was
grainy
tasted
initially
like
an
average
macro
or
even
a
malt
liquor
and
as
it
warmed
slightly
taste
was
dominated
by
alcohol
from
start
to
finish
dont
get
me
wrong
it
wasnt
at
least
for
me
a
deterrent
to
my
enjoyment
of
this
brew
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
not
one
of
the
better
baltikas
ive
had
but
id
probably
give
it
another
go
at
my
next
backyard
bbq
i
can
already
feel
a
headache
coming
on
this
one
i
feel
like
i
am
drinking
40
ozs
of
hurricane
malt
liquor
again
back
in
my
high
school
days
the
gross
alcohol
is
all
that
makes
up
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
to
get
blitzed
cheap
at
a
frat
party
but
still
want
to
look
cultured
go
get
yourself
a
few
of
these
there
is
nothing
to
this
beer
other
than
a
massive
alcohol
backbone
and
a
nice
pretty
golden
color
very
disappointing
beer
the
worst
so
far
from
this
brewery

if
you
like
malt
liquor
then
you
cant
miss
this
one
but
if
you
dont
you
might
want
to
steer
clear
of
it
while
there
is
some
mildly
decent
maltiness
really
though
its
only
barely
adequate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
this
beer
fails
to
impress
thanks
to
the
total
lack
of
hop
aroma
or
flavor
and
the
strong
alcohol
taste
at
8
theres
not
really
that
much
alcohol
in
this
one
just
nothing
else
to
mellow
it
out
in
fact
i
might
have
some
trouble
finishing
it
off
not
recommended
it
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
lemon
character
in
it
as
well
as
a
little
cornlike
graininess
the
flavor
was
terrible
cardboard
and
chemicals
as
kmpitz2
said
i
had
to
pour
this
one
out
this
brew
pours
an
ultra
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
sits
nicely
over
top
the
nose
is
grainey
slightly
sweet
and
lemony
wtih
a
whiff
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
awful
i
dont
think
it
is
oxidized
but
it
has
this
cardboard
and
chemical
flavor
to
it
that
just
really
is
offensive
the
feel
is
moderate
with
an
active
carb
i
dont
think
i
will
be
finishing
this
one
the
flavor
is
just
not
all
that
great
and
keeps
it
from
being
worth
any
more
sips
didnt
really
know
what
this
was
until
i
brought
it
home
and
looked
up
some
reviews
seems
to
be
a
russian
malt
liquor
500
ml
bottle
best
before
nov
13
2005
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
actually
looks
ok
kind
of
a
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
1
finger
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lace
smells
of
sweet
metallic
corn
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
very
macroish
the
taste
isnt
very
pleasant
its
thick
tastes
the
same
as
the
smell
and
has
no
hops
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
isnt
impressive
and
as
far
as
drinkability
its
the
closest
ive
come
to
dumping
a
beer
im
reviewing
down
the
drain
taste
is
macroswill
with
a
definite
touch
of
booze
unbalanced
and
really
pretty
unpleasant
to
drink
more
stank
more
minerals
stripmined
from
the
malts
lightly
sweet
in
the
after
drinkability

this
went
down
a
litter
rougher
than
the
3
i
can
enjoy
and
appreciate
a
stiff
boozy
brew
but
this
was
a
bit
harsh
for
my
preferences
a
clean
light
yellowstraw
colored
beer
has
big
tightly
bubbeled
bright
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
malt
biscuit
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
in
the
background
almost
no
real
flavor
at
all
some
hints
of
a
biscuity
malt
in
there
very
light
and
also
the
hops
are
only
hinted
at
in
the
finish
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
if
you
want
a
buzz
this
will
give
you
one
i
think
curiosity
is
an
inherent
trait
of
all
bas
and
this
curiosity
led
me
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
brew
upon
opening
the
bottle
i
immediately
smell
a
strong
sweet
maltiness
that
is
a
tad
over
the
top
almost
like
a
concentrated
macro
lager
appearance
is
straw
yellow
with
a
large
soapy
looking
white
head
which
leaves
large
bubbles
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
instead
of
a
gentle
lacing
taste
is
initially
grainy
before
finishing
super
super
sweet
a
floral
type
of
sweetness
no
alcohol
is
detectable
not
very
pleasing
to
me
id
like
to
try
other
beers
from
baltika
as
this
one
will
not
be
a
repeat
buy
for
me
ghastly
essentially
this
is
imported
bad
malt
liquor
cidery
malt
with
an
overwhelming
fusel
alcohol
presence
phenolic
medicinal
notes
a
strong
lager
can
be
done
well
or
as
this
demonstrates
very
very
badly
ive
had
a
couple
of
beers
from
this
brewery
that
werent
too
bad
so
i
wonder
how
they
can
crank
this
stuff
out
perhaps
this
works
with
the
local
taste
i
could
drink
this
one
for
a
while
but
the
abv
could
slow
me
down
but
the
taste
is
very
appley
and
sweet
like
i
was
trying
a
radler
for
some
reason
there
is
a
late
taste
of
the
alcohol
but
its
pretty
smooth
maybe
it
can
be
passed
off
as
a
wine
cooler
okay
trying
it
again
after
having
the
bottled
version
the
alcohol
warmth
is
kind
of
welcoming
theres
still
a
big
sugary
taste
but
for
some
reason
it
doesnt
bother
me
as
much
still
theres
an
undeniable
attraction
to
being
able
to
buy
this
from
a
kiosk
on
almost
any
residential
corner
in
russia
and
to
drink
it
just
while
walking
around
this
beer
has
its
niche
in
the
market
of
those
who
enjoy
drinking
swillish
beers
that
look
more
sophisticated
than
budweiser
or
coors
i
personally
couldnt
tell
the
difference
and
would
rather
have
kept
this
one
in
the
bottle
beer
is
good
happy
ruskie
beering
baltika
can
make
a
decent
beer
their
6
baltic
porter
is
quite
tasty
and
a
steal
at
1
75
dont
waste
your
time
with
the
9
pours
a
transparent
rich
yellow
with
a
white
frothy
head
the
head
dips
down
within
a
minute
to
leave
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
belgian
lace
across
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
has
a
big
musty
graininess
to
it
with
a
bit
of
medicinal
herbal
hops
hint
of
alcohol
and
hint
creamed
corn
tossed
in
for
good
measure
very
aggressive
carbonation
rips
across
the
tongue
barely
giving
anything
a
chance
to
be
sampled
herbal
raw
bitterness
leads
the
second
advance
moving
to
a
mild
alcohol
bite
wrapped
in
residual
sweetness
simplest
way
to
describe
this
would
be
malt
liquor
with
hops
and
not
quite
as
thick
mouthfeel
is
mildly
coating
and
the
carbonation
really
works
the
palate
over
like
ivan
drago
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
and
undeserving
of
the
low
rating
it
seems
to
have
garnered
for
itself
just
say
nyet
it
pours
a
clear
straw
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
musty
grainy
and
flowery
aromas
bready
and
grainy
flavors
medium
bodied
nice
crisp
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
finishes
sweet
yet
clean
a
decent
malt
liquor
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
i
got
three
from
this
brewery
and
i
find
myself
praying
the
others
are
better
than
this
not
that
great
of
a
beer
it
wasnt
horrible
but
not
really
worth
it
this
is
no
hevelius
kaper
thin
sweet
and
it
certainly
has
some
adjuncts
not
terrible
but
only
worth
it
if
you
want
the
alcohol
bang
for
your
buck
if
your
looking
for
a
good
high
abv
baltic
lager
get
the
kaper
this
one
is
a
little
hard
to
swallow
i
think
high
alcohol
beers
have
a
challenge
justifying
their
existence
in
terms
of
flavor
this
one
doesnt
quite
rise
to
it
of
the
order
of
other
strong
crap
lagers
say
bavarias

this
beer
is
dull
as
a
lager
a
bit
more
orangey
but
hey
nothing
out
of
the
order
excessively
sweet
bad
in
hops
perceivable
alcohol
etc
theres
really
nothing
great
to
it
aside
from
where
it
comes
from
hehe
but
thats
personal
now
drinkability
this
is
really
just
a
very
smooth
malt
liquor
taste
is
pretty
clear
and
weak
there
are
hops
in
the
end
of
the
flavor
and
hints
of
pear
left
on
the
tongue
but
it
is
otherwise
very
flavorless
this
beer
has
a
nice
clear
gold
color
with
a
small
head
that
vanished
quickly
there
was
no
lace
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
slightly
metallic
with
traces
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
that
of
sweet
grainy
malt
and
alcohol
coupled
with
a
decent
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
mellow
and
seemed
a
little
doughy
towards
a
sweet
dryish
finish
the
high
alcohol
level
gives
you
a
good
relaxing
buzz
sorry
comrades
to
me
beer
is
about
the
taste
not
the
alcohol
content
as
has
been
noted
previously
a
basic
baltic
malt
likka
who
needs
it
learn
from
my
sad
experience
avoid
like
the
bubonic
plague
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
large
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
thick
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
weak
some
sweetness
and
grass
are
detected
there
is
a
sweet
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
malt
is
the
strongest
towards
flavor
and
only
a
hint
of
hops
is
detected
very
smooth
aftertaste
not
terrible
but
not
too
exciting
either
this
one
poured
a
light
golden
colour
almost
like
a
reposado
style
tequila
it
began
with
a
lovely
thick
snow
white
head
approximately
2
centimetres
in
thickness
thats
a
bit
less
than
an
inch
it
left
quite
nice
lacing
in
my
glass
but
the
head
soon
dissipated
to
about
half
its
original
thickness
and
then
soon
after
all
but
faded
into
a
light
white
haze
the
smell
is
quite
unusual
in
that
it
doesnt
really
smell
quite
like
any
other
beer
or
ale
that
ive
had
before
one
can
smell
a
wee
bit
of
yeast
but
other
characteristics
seem
to
me
unidentifiable
the
taste
like
the
smell
is
peculiar
not
bad
or
dissatisfying
just
peculiar
it
goes
down
easy
the
80abv
is
evident
when
it
hits
bottom
to
one
who
is
used
to
quite
mild
beers
and
ales
but
all
in
all
theres
nothing
terribly
wrong
with
this
one
it
isnt
the
greatest
brew
ive
ever
had
likewise
it
isnt
the
worst
carbonation
was
right
where
it
needed
to
be
not
absent
yet
not
like
sprite
just
beneath
the
middle
of
those
two
id
probably
drink
one
of
these
again
pale
gold
and
crystal
clear
light
puffy
finebubbled
head
and
crystalline
lace
distinct
raisiny
grape
aroma
lots
of
fusels
malt
is
honeyish
but
masked
by
an
astringent
pruney
grape
and
cheap
table
winelike
character
finishes
lighter
but
still
vinous
with
a
speck
of
hop
thats
a
bit
clovelike
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
harsh
alcohol
without
fun
or
redeeming
flavors
that
make
it
worth
it
has
a
real
malt
liquor
style
and
flush
to
it
and
overall
its
a
little
weird
and
on
the
sour
side
harsh
and
worsens
as
it
warms
i
cant
say
this
is
at
all
worth
keeping

something
i
might
try
again
when
its
a
little
more
ukrainian
outside
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
bone
white
lacey
head
the
aroma
is
quite
plain
but
maintains
all
the
traditional
lager
qualities
the
taste
is
really
good
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
lagers
but
this
one
is
smooth
and
refreshing
also
the
elevated
abv
8
is
not
noticable
there
is
very
little
bitterness
and
the
taste
although
plain
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
rough
there
is
way
too
much
carbonation
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
like
a
premium
vodka
this
beer
only
succeeds
in
hiding
its
abv
rather
tasteless
malt
liquor
drinkers
should
buy
this
considering
i

9oz
and
i
could
drink
it
warm
light
yellow
color
with
just
the
hint
of
hops
overall
a
good
beer
to
tie
one
on
light
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
but
leaves
some
chunky
lacing
randomly
around
the
glass
smell
is
grassy
with
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
no
alcohol
smell
for
such
a
strong
beer
taste
is
bitter
upfront
hot
hoppy
just
bitter
a
pine
and
lemon
flavor
rolls
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
then
an
alcohol
bitter
warmth
settles
in
a
little
skunk
creeps
in
afterward
all
right
its
not
a
kick
ass
beer
but
its
better
than
most
malt
liquors
and
doesnt
leave
that
furry
phlegm
ball
in
the
back
of
your
throat
very
light
gold
color
small
head
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
sweet
its
very
sweet
lots
of
corn
added
the
corn
flavor
is
balanced
by
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
no
hops
to
speak
of
yet
there
is
some
bitterness
whose
origin
i
dont
really
want
to
know
this
stuff
is
really
awful
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
chemical
and
bitter
as
it
pours
into
the
glass
you
think
light
lager
yellow
color
white
fizzy
head
with
big
bubbles
next
to
no
lace
the
smell
is
light
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
the
mouth
tingles
and
you
can
feel
the
hops
starting
to
come
out
as
the
liquid
flows
over
the
tongue
next
thing
you
notice
is
the
alcohol
content
which
is
just
slightly
reminiscent
of
a
very
watered
down
whiskey
the
aftertaste
is
hoppy
bitter
but
with
a
metallic
bite
that
leaves
a
most
unpleasant
impression
ive
had
much
worse
russian
strong
beers
but
i
wont
be
having
another
one
of
these
either
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
grainy
wit
a
slight
fruity
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
fruit
hop
flavors
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
a
sweet
finish
it
is
easy
drinking
for
its
strength
not
a
bad
beer
the
russian
guy
i
bought
this
from
seemed
very
excited
that
someone
was
actually
buying
this
he
reccomended
it
highly
several
times
i
couldnt
believe
it
was
8
because
it
looked
so
light
the
pour
and
appearance
were
horrible
i
swear
it
looked
like
water
when
i
was
pouring
it
i
had
to
really
stir
things
up
with
the
pour
or
i
doubt
any
head
at
all
would
of
resulted
poured
34
of
an
inch
head
that
died
to
nothing
leaving
a
soapy
and
sticky
white
lace
the
color
is
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
the
smell
reminds
me
of
that
budweiser
macro
crap
shit
light
bodied
with
a
strong
alcohol
taste
and
finish
aroma
is
of
corn
with
a
skunky
and
light
malt
smell
a
slight
crispness
with
a
lingering
bitterness
that
wont
leave
the
back
of
my
throat
freshness
date
expired
two
months
agobut
that
doesnt
really
concern
me
they
must
of
added
vodka
to
this
because
i
cant
figure
out
how
they
made
this
8
and
so
light
tasting
i
give
them
credit
for
that
i
am
already
feeling
this
beer
after
only
half
of
it
there
must
be
some
hops
in
it
because
of
the
bitter
finish
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
unless
i
was
broke
and
wanted
a
quick
buzz
budweiser
fans
should
switch
to
this
stuff
and
they
wouldnt
need
a
30pack
to
get
drunk
overall
interesting
the
bottle
is
fresh
and
was
wellsealed
i
hate
to
do
it
but
i
guess
im
not
really
rating
this
beer
with
its
style
in
mind
granted
its
much
tastier
than
most
american
malt
liquors
but
thats
not
enough
of
a
redeeming
characteristic
for
me
to
rate
this
beer
any
higher
than
i
am
from
a
fresh
bottle
thats
just
a
few
months
old
it
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
and
almost
greentinted
body
thats
capped
by
a
foamy
brightwhite
head
which
holds
well
and
maintains
a
thin
surface
covering
throughout
most
of
the
glass
unfortunately
it
leaves
only
minor
lace
the
nose
expresses
sweet
malt
thats
grainy
and
bready
alongside
some
limited
grassy
hops
its
surprisingly
nice
compared
with
most
strong
russian
lagers
which
incorporate
high
levels
of
adjunct
however
in
typical
russianstyle
the
medium
body
is
coupled
with
a
finebubbled
but
moderate
carbonation
that
leaves
it
more
smooth
creamy
than
crisp
still
its
fairly
nice
and
doesnt
work
against
the
beer
the
flavor
is
mainly
of
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
light
touch
of
hop
flavor
and
a
supportive
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
and
it
finishes
clean
but
only
semidry
with
some
lingering
sweet
malt
its
well
done
and
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
its
strength
a
malt
liquor
that
masks
the
alcohol
very
well
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
everything
about
it
was
average
except
for
mouthfeel
which
was
rather
like
having
cotton
in
your
mouth
go
figrue
that
one
out
i
havent
put
this
in
a
40
and
market
it
as
a
highclass
malt
liquor
import
which
it
is
light
golden
in
hue
w
a
slight
haze
thick
fluffy
white
head
with
decent
retention
attractive
lace
is
left
somewhat
pilsner
like
in
appearance
trace
grassy
hop
along
w
light
bready
sweetness
in
aroma
not
much
else
there
aromawise
any
similarities
to
a
pilsner
immediately
end
with
a
brash
of
grainy
sweetness
on
the
palate
which
persists
throughout
the
taste
once
the
graininess
fades
sweetness
becomes
sugary
and
reminescent
of
underattenuated
wort
hop
bitterness
is
virtually
nonexistant
lightly
bodied
and
smooth
enough
in
mouthfeel
to
facilitate
easy
drinking
copious
quaffing
to
acheive
a
buzz
finishes
sweet
clean
and
bland
baltika
strong
is
not
a
good
beer
but
is
a
notch
above
the
typical
malt
liquor
flavorwise
and
pricewise
its
reminescent
of
king
cobra
without
the
adjuncts
at
first
taste
not
bad
but
after
the
second
and
third
sip
it
had
just
a
slight
bitterness
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
flavor
i
could
my
finger
on
one
more
sip
and
i
was
turned
off
and
deposited
it
down
the
drain
first
no
second
brew
i
ever
poured
down
the
drain
notes
do
they
sell
this
one
in
40s
down
in
their
hood
spot
on
for
the
american
malt
liquor
style
though
this
is
probably
not
what
they
were
going
for
careful
with
this
one
meaning
dont
make
this
one
of
your
last
beers
of
the
night
never
having
tasted
a
russain
beer
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
a
friend
of
mine
gave
it
to
me
thinking
i
would
like
to
try
it
i
did
like
trying
it
but
i
would
never
drink
it
again
tased
like
a
sweet
version
of
a
malt
liquor
cold
it
was
drinkable
when
it
warmed
just
slighlty
i
had
trouble
getting
it
down
by
the
way
in
russia
baltika
9
extra
is
on
the
second
place
on
popularity
after
baltika
3
classic
this
is
the
one
of
the
most
ugly
beer
in
russia
never
try
to
buy
this
never
o
looks
good
but
it
is
definitely
not
good
put
some
of
this
in
your
cooler
when
youre
taking
a
trip
dig
its
like
colt
45
works
every
time
baby
not
a
great
beer
but
strong
for
a
russian
malt
liquor
my
bottle
was
labelled
yarpivo
extra
lager
but
i
think
it
is
the
same
as
this
yarpivo
strong
the
smell
is
quite
nice
i
got
piney
hops
and
maple
syrup
the
taste
is
weak
but
there
is
some
piney
hops
it
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
and
the
aftertaste
isnt
great
not
a
great
beer
but
not
terrible
either
not
one
ill
actively
seek
out
again
nasty
tastes
like
an
alcoholfortified
grain
beverage
meant
for
soccer
hooligans
usually
sold
alongside
their
mainstream
amber
5

abv
and
lighter
4

varieties
which
have
some
merit
this
brewery
also
markets
largersize
screwtop
plastic
bottles
of
beer
under
various
names
with
similar
overproof
alcohol
levels
that
smack
of
getdrunkquick
swill
to
be
avoided
whenever
possible
this
pours
from
a
bottle
marked

sampled
on
february

2010
the
pour
is
about
its
best
quality
with
a
slightly
cloudy
copperamber
with
a
thin
soapy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
seems
stale
to
me
witha
little
bit
of
malts
on
the
nose
but
more
like
day
old
bread
the
taste
is
not
a
wholelot
better
it
is
mainly
bland
stale
bread
and
a
touch
of
hops
behind
it
it
reminds
me
of
flavored
cardboard
unfortunately
and
it
took
me
forever
to
get
it
down
for
all
of
the
generous
head
this
actually
ends
up
being
a
bit
flat
the
slick
mouthfeel
certainly
doesnt
help
lovers
of
allmalt
macros
may
enjoy
this
for
a
the
price
99
for
a
1
pint
9oz
bottle
and
b
the
high
abv
7
2
but
theres
simply
got
to
be
a
better
option
out
there
down
the
drain
we
go
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
and
adjunct
scent
its
crisp
and
clean
with
little
to
no
hop
aroma
the
taste
isnt
very
good
it
has
a
very
dry
and
bitter
flavor
its
full
of
pale
malts
and
adjuncts
as
well
as
an
earthy
yeast
component
hops
are
nowhere
to
be
found
the
mouthfeel
is
horrible
it
has
a
dry
metallic
feel
with
good
carbonation
its
full
bodied
and
hard
to
put
down
this
is
going
right
to
the
drain
this
is
just
not
a
very
good
tasting
beer
its
one
and
done
for
me
id
rather
have
a
steel
reserve
more
drinkable
than
any
american
malt
liquor
somewhere
between
a
good
german
lager
and
alcohol
boosted
piss
in
a
glass
a
toasted
grain
flavored
beer
that
i
actually
like
for
the
1
69
the
12
liter
cost
this
is
a
completely
acceptable
beer
cheers
i
believe
this
is
the
same
beer
as
the
abv
is
the
same
although
my
bottle
bore
the
designation
extra
poured
an
almost
frighteningly
luminous
gold
with
nominal
and
shortlived
head
a
bit
of
sweetish
malt
in
the
aroma
flavor
was
a
fairly
standard
eurolager
profile
and
a
bit
smoother
than
i
would
have
expected
some
artificial
sweetener
at
the
finish
but
not
too
bad
alcohol
hinted
at
harshness
but
managed
to
fall
back
into
line
surprisingly
well
an
okay
beer
but
certainly
beats
the
pants
off
any
u
s
malt
liquor
if
one
is
so
inclined
clear
gold
color
big
fluffy
head
pretty
standard
looking
for
a
eurp
strong
lager
sharp
grain
alcohol
and
corny
smelling
taste
is
strongly
alcoholic
like
rancid
milwaukees
best
with
some
vodka
dumped
in
it
yuck
sharp
and
offensive
this
is
one
of
theworst
tasting
euro
strong
lagers
that
ive
had
avoid
wow
poured
in
a
glass
with
wonderful
ease
left
a
bright
white
full
head
sitting
on
top
of
yellow
liquid
gummi
bear
center
of
the
head
dissipates
but
the
lace
is
full
and
intact
a
nice
light
yet
full
malty
smell
that
causes
this
mouth
to
water
first
sip
is
odd
leads
with
the
malt
and
refuses
to
carry
thru
with
an
aftertaste
2nd
sip
was
a
bit
more
cloying
could
feel
the
beer
running
down
the
inside
of
my
cheeks
good
taste
for
this
abv
the
flavor
is
very
light
sticking
very
well
to
lager
rules
will
stock
this
find
this
one
its
good
a
strong
alcohol
content
is
evident
from
the
aroma
and
grainy
flavor
a
quick
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
this
one
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
dont
blink
though
or
the
head
will
be
gone
no
lace
and
practically
no
collar
the
nose
is
big
strong
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
tingly
the
taste
is
powerful
sweetness
rice
listed
as
an
ingredient
and
alcohol
there
is
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
it
is
pretty
much
overwhelmed
by
the
sweet
malt
i
wont
be
having
another
yarpivo
means
beer
pivo
from
yaroslavl
which
is
located
in
central
russia
it
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
body
with
a
full
and
foamy
brightwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
keeps
a
thin
collar
through
the
start
of
the
glass
but
eventually
drops
to
an
entirely
flat
surface
the
nose
displays
clean
sweet
malt
with
a
very
mild
touch
of
alcohol
its
full
bodied
and
mildly
zesty
on
the
tongue
once
tasted
rich
sweet
malt
abounds
obviously
adjunct
laden
and
overriding
whatever
bitterness
is
present
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
lay
on
the
tongue
in
a
lingering
semisweet
finish
very
much
like
an
american
malt
liquor
interesting
and
fairly
well
done
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
good
beer
with
thin
taste
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
was
stronger
than
expected
and
got
to
me
even
as
i
poured
that
being
said
the
aroma
is
nothing
spectacular
just
prevalent
i
cant
even
really
pick
out
a
certain
scent
not
that
i
have
the
best
nose
for
it
anyways
but
it
smells
like
any
aal
you
might
bother
pouring
in
a
glass
taste
is
equally
unspectacular
anyone
that
has
had
the
bad
luck
to
try
a
regular
cruzcampo
would
recognize
the
lack
of
taste
outside
of
a
metallic
coppery
finish
there
is
a
hint
of
a
sweet
malt
profile
trying
to
sneak
through
the
increased
alcohol
brings
some
body
that
is
welcomed
overall
not
great
but
much
more
palatable
than
its
humble
cousin
and
hey
its

you

some

with
a

feeling
too
better
than
the
usual
cruzcampo
the
one
nowadays
it
used
to
be
better
long

but
not
a
great
thing
o
this
is
a
fairly
typical
european
lager
with
not
much
to
recommend
it
other
than
the
higher

and
alcohol
content
than
usual
its
a
decent
beer
for

but
that
is
not

much
o
decent
for

quite
boozy
and

certainly
better

i
guess
is
the
sticking
point
spain
is
starting
to
catch

to
the

thing
but
bnot
quick
enough
this
beer
pouts
a
light

into
my
chalice
with
some
decent

quickly
down
to

is

not

else
tstebis
slightly

overall
a

i
guess
us
drink
one
more
if
it
was

tome
in
a
social
setting
it
a
more
structured
and
alcoholic
than
a

standard
but
we
cant
talk
to
who
knows
what
wonders
overall
good

short
finish
of

and
a

i
drank
this
beer
10
years
ago
and
it
was
disapointing
now
its
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
few
fingers
of
puffy
off
white
head
that
melts
away
leaving
no
lacing
it
smells
of
sour
grape
essence
and
mildly
sweet
malt
it
tastes
of
sweet
wood
flavours
citrus
grape
must
and
caramel
malt
the
carbonation
is
quite
mild
and
the
alcohol
not
really
noticeable
just
a
slight
warming
this
finishes
smooth
with
the
brandy
edge
holding
on
for
a
little
while
a
pretty
interesting
and
natural
pairing
of
french
beverages
that
while
being
a
blend
instead
of
an
aged
in
wood
product
produces
similar
impressions
as
those
offerings
from
innis
gunn
and
brewdog
i
love
both
cognac
and
beer
and
beleive
blending
them
or
perhalps
aging
beer
in
cognac
barrels
is
a
good
idea
i
dont
feel
the
base
beer
used
here
is
the
best
one
for
this
combination
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
french
style
bière
de
garde
this
beer
gets
an
unfairly
bad
rap
first
off
its
a
weirdie
right
off
the
bat
as
its
an
orangeamber
beer
blended
with
actual
cognac
if
you
dont
like
cognac
or
any
brandy
dont
try
it
you
wont
like
it
its
cognac
beer
for
those
that
are
interested
read
on
it
pours
nicely
its
head
isnt
remarkable
but
not
unacceptable
very
pronounced
cognac
nose
i
must
have
had
a
fresh
bottle
the
beer
tasted
fresh
and
the
balance
was
better
than
most
reviews
had
me
believing
cognac
taste
is
very
present
of
course
but
its
still
a
beer
smooth
and
drinkable
pleasant
alcohol
was
not
overly
pronounced
excellent
alternative
to
a
port
or
cognac
after
dinner
or
with
a
cigar
or
dessert
i
find
its
similar
in
spirit
to
innis
gunn
id
recommend
it
for
those
who
like
ports
and
cognacs
the
astringency
of
this
beer
makes
a
little
bit
of
a
sipper
but
i
would
definetly
not
mind
having
this
beer
again
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
17
2007
at
smokeless
joe
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
colour
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
was
cognac
malt
alcohol
and
burnt
butterscotch
the
mouthfeel
was
very
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
some
mild
carbonation
the
taste
was
very
heavy
on
the
cognac
and
a
little
hint
of
fruit
i
did
feel
the
alcohol
burn
and
for
a
beer
with
an
8
abv
thats
not
good
in
my
book
a
little
pricey
at
14
25bottle
as
well
when
i
can
visit
some
other
places
and
get
an
abbey
quadrupel
for
less
truth
be
told
this
bieredugardetype
base
beer
while
not
a
perfect
match
does
little
to
hinder
the
cognac
except
with
regards
to
regulating
its
alcoholic
intensity
and
remodeling
it
for
slightly
larger
more
casually
quaffed
sips
both
of
which
are
positive
amendments
for
my
purposes
still
however
the
beer
by
and
large
retains
much
of
the
balance
and
delicacy
the
sublime
serenity
that
characterizes
even
the
youngest
of
frances
cognacs
d
interesting
but
not
highly
drinkable
ok
but
not
great
not
enough
beer
flavor
and
too
much
alcohol
flavor
not
horrible
not
amazing
not
likely
to
get
this
one
again
any
time
soon
drinkabilitynotes
wellbalanced
example
quite
well
done
i
like
this
one
it
isnt
an
amazing
beer
but
it
is
quite
unique
from
my
tasting
experience
and
pleasant
to
drink
i
could
see
it
being
a
nice
desert
beer
for
a
winter
meal
the
idea
for
this
beer
was
interestingbut
id
say
an
experiment
gone
wrong
overall
impression
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
for
me
but
cognac
isnt
a
favorite
of
mine
if
you
enjoy
it
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
as
someone
else
mentioned
this
makes
a
good
desert
or
christmas
beer
bottle
decants
a
brilliant
clear
garnet
with
amber
hilights
not
much
of
a
cap
even
from
a
hard
pour
aroma
is
perfumey
some
grape
with
some
sweet
treacle
tones
starts
sweet
with
some
molasses
tastes
then
you
catch
the
dry
grapes
and
the
alcohol
takes
over
the
palate
for
the
rest
of
the
ride
to
the
finish
the
finish
is
alcohol
pronounced
and
warming
this
is
more
like
a
cocktail
or
mixed
drink
than
a
beer
not
to
my
liking
wont
revisit
rye
and
coke
is
more
palatable
drinkability
notes
i
dont
think
i
have
every
used
the
term
drain
pour
before

this
is
without
a
doubt
a
drain
pour
not
even
sure
i
would
cook
with
this
drinkability
the
perfume
almost
put
me
under
but
interesting
that
said
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
you
need
to
use
it
it
the
right
place
definitely
not
something
you
want
to
knock
back
a
lot
of
in
short
order
you
wouldnt
swill
a
cognac
so
id
suggest
treating
this
beer
the
same
way
sip
at
it
and
enjoy
it
slowly
after
dinner
the
taste
even
though
initially
strong
of
raspberries
was
very
abrupt
and
left
me
wondering
what
happened
cognac
was
to
quick
to
respond
weird
beer
but
then
mixing
cognac
in
beer
is
a
weird
idea
the
result
aroma
and
flavour
neither
of
beer
nor
cognac
but
of
raspberries
and
boysenberries
rather
sweet
but
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
makes
you
fear
not
really
godawful
but
definitely
not
a
beer
ill
buy
again
beer
is
beer
and
cognac
is
cognac
and
never
shall
the
two
meet
again
this
was
very
enjoyable
for
a
sweeter
beer
and
would
be
perfect
as
a
dessert
beer
get
into
it
i
wouldnt
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
a
lovely
beer
that
i
could
polish
off
next
to
a
big
slice
of
coffee
torte
simply
superb
because
it
is
so
sweet
you
may
not
want
to
have
too
many
today
i
had
this
beer
first
impression
is
soft
but
last
taste
was
little
bitter
just
exactly
same
taste
with
somacusually
drink
sojubeer
in
korea
but
more
soft
better
than
somac
poured
a
tall
500
ml
can
into
a
pint
glass
why
am
i
drinking
this
crosses
my
mind
a
bright
yellow
hue
with
a
crazy
amount
of
beige
foam
looks
a
lot
like
ginger
ale
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
with
the
exception
of
a
corn
sugar
sweetness
accompanied
by
a
twinge
of
wet
grain
tastes
like
vodkaharsh
boiled
grains
chalky
grape
juice
or
sour
hard
candy
and
anemic
grassy
hops
less
sweet
and
perhaps
just
a
smidgen
more
refined
than
american
malt
liquors
but
the
same
basic
idea
a
notable
industrial
alcohol
warmth
emerges
and
i
am
thinking
that
this
is
reminiscent
of
a
very
lowrent
imperial
pilsener
watery
body
is
coupled
with
the
expected
aggressive
carbonation
and
theres
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
that
you
dont
get
in
north
american
brewed
cheap
beers
finishes
crisp
but
with
more
residual
sweetness
than
a
euro
pale
lager
grainy
with
an
echo
of
saccharine
fruitiness
basically
the
intent
of
such
a
beer
is
to
provide
a
cheap
intoxicant
a
la
north
american
malt
liquors
it
probably
suits
this
purpose
admirably
and
tastes
marginally
better
than
its
new
world
cousins
thats
the
best
that
can
be
said
could
be
worse
golden

an
one

with
low

but
leaving
some

aroma

pale

and

malty
flavor
with
notes
of
apple

light

with
good
carbonation
relatively
smooth

addition
and

is
surprisingly
well
hidden
i
was
expecting
a
blunt
malt
liquor
with
unpleasant
flavors
but
although
plain
and
lacking
hops
it
is
relatively
decent
for
the
style
final
grade
2
3
an
embarrassing
d
the
thing
that
impresses
me
most
about
bavaria
8

is
probably
the
drinkability
it
basically
just
tastes
sweet
and
wet
and
even
though
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
there
and
it
will
hit
you
eventually
this
is
definitely
not
an
especially
raunchytasting
lager
considering
the
abv
reminds
me
a
little
of
boxer
ice
with
its
weird
fruity
funky
offtastes
i
worked
at
a
liquor
store
in
alberta
that
sold
these
the
only
customers
i
ever
saw
purchase
them
were
homeless
people
and
regulars
alcoholics
two
of
these
might
give
you
a
decent
buzz
for
45
bucks
but
warka
strong
can
do
the
same
while
allowing
you
to
retain
your
selfrespect
for
the
rest
of
the
night
id
only
drink
this
again
if
i
were
pretty
desperate
pale
golden

1
5
fingers

white

decent
amount
of

and

with
apple

like
scents
malty
followed
immediately
by
alcohol
dirty
water
like
scents
come
in
earthy
and
muddy
as
well
taste
is
grainy
and
metallic
more
of
that
muddy
earth
that
was
in
the
nose
apple
juice
light
alcohol
but
surprisingly
well
hidden
medium
carbonation
medfull
body
decent
enough
feel
this
was
pretty
bad
but
i
finished
the
can
off
without
a
problem
i
would
probably
never
buy
this
again
but
i
didnt
mind
drinking
it
once
overall
i
had
very
low
expectations
for
this
beer
but
ti
actually
turned
out
to
be
fairly
decent
the
alcohol
isnt
as
noticeable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
the
beer
had
a
fantastic
appearance
ion
the
glass
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
overall
i
was
a
bit
underimpressed
with
this
as
a
specialty
beer
but
as
a
macro
lager
i
was
quite
pleased
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
boldness
of
the
flavor
while
there
was
not
much
there
to
pick
apart
the
flavors
presented
came
through
with
a
surprising
strength
where
it
started
to
become
unpleasant
was
when
at
the
tail
end
of
the
middle
the
alcoholic
burn
took
over
the
entire
flavor
turning
it
into
straight
liquor
overall
this
is
a
cheap
and
powerful
beer
for
those
who
are
embarrassed
with
buying
malt
liquor
when
it
comes
to
strong
beer
its
a
little
to
thick
and
sweet
for
my
taste
dr
id
have
it
again
to
get
drunk
at
this
price
range
its
high
abv
is
quite
welcome
i
appreciate
beers
that
experiment
but
this
one
is
a
failure
d
i
would
definitely
not
recommend
anyone
pick
up
a
can
but
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
and
i
was
easily
able
to
take
down
the
can
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
and
all
other
characteristics
were
lacking
with
the
only
respectable
category
being
appearance
well
it
is
a
cheap
beer
so
what
should
you
expect
and
it
is
nearly
8
abv
pours
a
medium
golden
clear
color
into
my
pint
glass
actually
gave
me
alot
of
head
that
did
stick
to
the
glass
not
much
in
the
smell
arena
can
barely
smell
anything
tast
is
warming
kinda
like
a
bud
with
a
shot
of
vodka
in
it
mouth
feelis
light
to
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
average
due
to
the
high
abv
stop
at
one
and
get
something
better
to
drink
musty
smell
of
old
cellar
and
the
old
nose
with
ripe
fruit
and
macerated
in
alcohol
too
a
very
hot
mouth
with
alcohol
in
abundance
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
reminiscent
of
the
liquor
or
white
wine
rich
in
sugars
and
highly
concentrated
easily
digestible
and
easy
to
drink
little
even
if
it
sits
right
in
terms
of
tasting
an
average
euro
strong
lager
i
didnt
find
it
very
enjoyable
but
it
is
pretty
par
for
the
course
in
comparison
to
others
of
the
style
i
have
tried
dmediumlow
drinkability
there
are
clearly
more
drinkable
macro
lager
brews
available
down
in
mexico
but
this
one
certainly
takes
the
cake
for
size
of
flavors
regretably
the
flavors
are
shadowed
by
the
harshness
of
the
moderately
high
abv
looks
great
but
it
makes
you
gag
as
you
swallow
and
thats
a
trait
i
dont
like
in
my
beer
the
beer
store
find
this
is
a
pale
euro
lager
with
extra
diesel
fuel
alcohol
pours
light
with
generous
white
bubbled
head
some
alcohol
in
aroma
thin
mouthfeel
not
much
in
taste
just
enough
malt
and
some
apple
juice
to
swallow
a
decent
sample
rest
drain
poured
as
is
by
now
probably
blindingly
obvious
the
elevated
abv
here
isnt
very
well
integrated
rendering
a
pretty
hot
lager
beer
experience
not
a
good
thing
this
is
a
favourite
from
what
i
can
tell
even
at
my
local
bottleshop
amongst
the
more
shabbily
attired
single
brand
purchasers
of
note
i
can
see
why
given
its
relatively
inexpensive
shelf
tag
and
overall
oomph
all
fine
as
long
as
your
taste
buds
take
a
sick
day
oh
and
this
is
still
markedly
better
than
anything
minhas
puts
out
around
here
its
not
completely
without
merit
but
its
the
last
one
ill
ever
have
summary
if
the
frat
is
looking
to
get
wild
this
weekend
without
the
typical
40oz
of
malt
liquor
or
the
kegs
of
iced
beer
this
is
the
brew
for
you
its
a
little
strong
but
hey
for
tailgating
grab
a
few
and
you
will
not
be
any
more
disappoint
then
your
other
offerings
c
for
soso
and
a
for
the
style
of
high
gravity
lager
this
is
clearly
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
the
only
point
i
can
see
to
this
beer
is
to
get
lager
louts
smashed
plus
i
fear
this
beer
could
give
you
a
headache
before
the
end
of
the
evening
if
you
try
more
than
1
bottle
overall
if
not
for
the
bad
taste
the
beer
could
be
quite
ok
this
beer
is
not
a
chore
but
a
far
cry
from
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
will
avoid
and
recommend
you
do
the
same
drinkability
a
not
impressed
beer
in
the
style
strong
lager
too
strong
7
9
abv
worst
beer
ive
had
in
years
now
in
the
mouth
is
watery
sweet
and
some
citruses
and
spices
it
tastes
very
artificial
yes
i
can
drink
it
again
but
why
bother
it
poured
with
a
rocky
two
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
the
nose
had
a
sweetish
metallic
quality
which
was
undesirable
the
color
was
a
deepgolden
shade
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
taste
like
corn
and
metal
not
what
i
was
after
the
finish
was
mildly
sweet
lagerlike
but
mostly
verboten
for
a
strong
beer
this
isnt
too
bad
in
the
way
of
drinkability
it
still
retains
crisp
freshness
but
a
little
to
strong
to
make
this
a
session
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
bubbly
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smells
like
an
empty
glass
tastes
fairly
sweet
but
not
malty
hard
to
describe
nondescript
sweetness
i
guess
no
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
there
is
some
alcohol
burn
there
but
thats
to
be
expected
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thats
about
it
i
swear
budweiser
has
more
flavor
than
this
beer
theres
nothing
to
it
at
all
overall
its
drinkable
because
theres
no
flavor
to
object
to
i
prefer
my
beer
to
taste
like
beer
though
this
seems
to
be
for
pretentious
college
kids
that
want
to
get
hammered
fast
i
dont
know
about
this
in
a
can
though
drinkability
not
bad
rochefort
beats
this
of
course
didnt
detect
any
chemical
overtones
perhaps
they
have
process
control
issues
this
is
somewhat
of
a
mixed
review
i
love
certain
aspects
of
this
beer
whilst
i
dislike
others
overall
appearance
is
great
even
the
can
feels
like
good
quality
lol
great
tasting
beer
and
very
sweet
however
i
dislike
the
strong
aftertaste
which
is
probably
so
overpowering
due
to
the
higher
alcohol
content
personally
i
have
never
been
able
to
consume
more
than
two
cans
at
one
sitting
overall
a
respectable
beer
but
imho
not
everybodys
cup
of
tea
overall
too
sweet
for
my
taste
no
hops
to
help
balance
it
probably
my
last
one
another
example
of
a
massproduced
strong
lager
its
a
goldenyellow
colored
brew
with
a
puffy
white
head
clear
and
simple
in
appearance
not
much
of
an
aroma
a
little
grain
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
almost
no
hop
aroma
and
no
real
malt
smell
the
taste
is
pretty
unimpressive
lots
of
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
serious
harshness
a
lot
of
warming
and
rough
alcohol
is
the
center
of
the
experience
with
this
beer
between
that
and
the
sweetness
which
occurs
without
any
real
flavor
this
beer
is
a
real
disappointment
drinkability
although
it

itself
a

is

designed
to
get

drunk
fast
it
is

not
as
good
as

the
beer
has
a
definite

presence
that
makes
the
going

this
is
controversial
it
couldve
been
much
better
had
it
properly
hidden
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
its
too
present
and
spoils
much
of
the
other
tastes
as
well
as
the
mouth
and
hey
one
of
the
worst
beers
youll
ever
have

is

you
might
as

pour
it

cold
and
from
my
time
served
at

store
in

it
would
seem
that
this
beer
also
has
the

cornered
the

is
a
slightly
better
beer
and
that
is
not
saying
very
much
because
theyre
both
atrocities
couldnt
get
the
brown
paper
bag
idea
out
of
my
head
though
so
i
couldnt
score
it
too
highly
it
looks
alright
but
i
have
no
idea
what
made
it
look
this
way
the
writing
on
the
wallcan
does
not
say
it
at
all
something
is
afoot
i
wonder
what
but
this
is
panama
and
everything
here
comes
by
crate
when
one
asks
the
question
who
is
john
frum
i
am
reminded
of
this
beer
quite
frankly
this
can
knocks
out
a
local
but
honestly
and
in
a
very
well
intentionedgoodnatured
way
they
dont
know
no
better
deep
red
colour
collar
of
whiteoff
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
lace
smell
is
a
mixture
of
malt
and
sugar
some
fruit
is
present
but
very
sweet
smelling
almost
candy
like
notes
mixed
with
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
awful
mixture
of
malt
and
sugar
some
cherry
taste
and
rocket
fuel
like
alcohol
just
terrible
medium
carbonation
syrupy
and
thick
feeling
medfull
body
this
was
just
horrible
no
person
should
ever
have
to
drink
this
i
barely
got
through
14
of
the
tall
can
before
this
saw
the
drain
avoid
at
all
costs
i
like
getting
blackout
drunk
as
much
as
the
next
guy
but
have
a
little
class
while
waking
up
in
a
chicken
coup
what
dose
remorse
taste
like
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
the
flavors
picked
up
a
bit
after
the
aroma
through
the
nose
we
were
expecting
something
admittedly
offensive
to
the
palate
but
rather
we
were
given
a
darker
brew
that
gave
a
robustness
of
flavor
that
presented
as
somewhat
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
components
i
will
not
give
this
drink
a
terrible
rating
i
have
bought
this
on
several
occasions
and
it
is
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
red
beer
for
most
occasions
however
i
would
advise
something
else
on
the
menu
d
unique
flavours
but
the
sweetness
is
just
too
much
for
my
liking
alcohol
is
not
hidden
and
slaps
you
around
a
bit
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
dr
buy
it
to
get
lambasted
if
you
dare
this
is
what
i
politely
call
a
student
beer
both
because
it
tastes
like
it
was
brewed
by
the
brewers
students
and
because
only
brokeass
students
would
drink
it
laughably
bad
for
the
style
the
price
could
be
worse
holy
jebus
what
a
jekyll
and
hyde
of
a
beer
looks
like
one
thing
and
tastes
like
one
unholy
sort
of
another
its
just
hard
to
reconcile
so
attractive
on
the
outside
evil
on
the
inside
ok
so
maybe
thats
not
an
altogether
uncommon
thing
anyway
this
is
to
paraphrase
a
tad
the
beer
your
mother
warned
you
about
like
the
aforementioned
world
cup
stunt
its
all
just
show
pomp
and
circumstance
and
skanky
under
the
hood
overall
this
is
like
malt
liquor
but
more
sugary
its
cheap
and
gets
you
loaded
if
you
can
get
through
the
taste
dits
like
someone
took
robitussin
and
let
it
sit
in
the
sun
for
8
12
hours
then
added
grain
alcohol
to
it
im
not
sure
if
i
can
finish
this
one
its
a
party
beer
and
might
appeal
to
the
crowd
who
just
wants
to
get
plastered
i
do
admit
its
a
little
better
with
salty
food
such
as
im
having
with
this
beer
in
the
last
bit
of
this
review
but
i
am
not
enjoying
this
definitely
the
worst
red
ive
tried
and
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
pass
i
ended
up
dumping
the
last
half
of
my
pint
just
couldnt
do
it
it
is
indeed
a
strong
lager
but
not
in
any
enjoyable
way
reminds
me
extensively
of
cheaper
beers
i
bought
earlier
in
my
youth
except
stronger
in
flavor
dsome
redeeming
qualities
but
too
sweet
again
this
seems
like
one
of
those
beers
that
im
afraid
young
kids
will
get
trashed
on
because
of
the
abv
and
the
sweetness
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
brew
is
too
sweet
although
it
does
have
nice
qualities
and
is
a
worthwhile
beverage
for
the
curious
probably
one
of
the
better
500ml
import
cans
available
in
alberta
if
you
dont
take
this
beer
too
seriously
you
might
enjoy
it
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
but
terrible
tasting
cheap
lager
i
wont
try
it
again
500
ml
can
from
cafam
smells
like
slightly
roasted
malts
and
some
red
licorice
with
a
little
caramel
pours
to
a
bright
amber
with
a
3
finger
head
with
great
structure
stands
well
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
taste
is
sharp
malts
with
some
bitterness
and
the
ac
is
most
prevalent
finish
is
better
than
the
start
with
some
caramel
this
seems
more
like
a
jumpstarter
than
a
a
brew
starts
to
mellow
as
it
warms
up
but
it
still
doesnt
get
there
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
has
a
problem
getting
past
the
taste
nothing
id
buy
again
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
bleached
white
cap
of
decent
froth
the
aroma
is
fruity
albiet
im
not
one
to
discern
which
fruit
it
is
maybe
some
cherries
its
pretty
arbitrary
there
is
also
some
haygrassfloral
aroma
that
is
tough
to
place
tastes
sweet
like
the
candied
cherries
red
pepper
jelly
its
sweet
and
too
much
so
for
me
cloying
and
no
fucking
way
im
drinking
this
whole
can
liquid
dessert
gone
wrong
blearrg
well
then
its
been
a
while
since
ive
done
a
sink
pour
but
thats
exactly
where
the
last
half
of
this
red
strong
beer
is
headed
cloyingly
sweet
to
start
with
a
bitter
beer
face
sour
finish
that
can
induce
intermittent
gagging
or
at
least
im
speaking
from
personal
experience
user
results
may
vary
a
beer
does
not
go
down
well
when
its
reminds
you
of
cough
syrup
so
i
had
to
push
myself
to
finish
it
pity
the
ratings
dont
go
lower
id
put
0
for
drinkability
and
0
5
for
taste
from
a
liter
can
this
beer
is
a
deep
red
color
with
a
decent
head
despite
reservations
the
pale
8
6
was
truly
awful
this
is
an
enticing
and
and
attractive
looking
brew
the
aroma
though
brings
the
goodness
to
an
abrupt
halt
sharp
and
unpleasant
alcohol
are
the
first
smell
followed
by
misplaced
fruits
theres
a
lot
of
ripe
berries
and
cherry
smells
but
theyre
not
backed
by
any
malt
qualities
instead
theyre
lonely
and
misplaced
esters
lost
in
a
sea
of
harsh
ethanol
the
taste
is
intensely
sweet
like
an
oversyruped
sodapop
only
with
a
lot
of
harsh
alcohol
the
beer
is
relatively
full
in
body
and
the
finish
is
warm
despite
appearances
this
is
not
a
good
beer
got
me
on
the
serving
type
it
was
one
of
those
new
fangled
metal
bottles
anyway
not
much
head
although
a
thin
cover
did
last
has
some
lace
color
is
brown
with
some
red
highlights
aroma
was
very
malty
sweet
but
caught
a
whiff
of
bleach
not
my
dishwater
which
is
filtered
plus
this
glass
had
its
3rd
beer
this
time
and
rinsed
flavors
just
the
same
body
is
surprisingly
thin
considering
sweetness
good
carbonation
helps
this
beer
a
lot
very
sweet
finish
two
dimensional
beer
the
nose
has
hints
of
raspberry
and
other
red
fruits
strawberry
and
of
course
is
fairly
sour
the
scent
develops
as
it
sits
later
on
i
got
a
lot
of
cheese
in
the
nose
like
camembert
or
rocheforte
the
flavor
is
malty
and
sour

not
particularly
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
a
little
overdone
on
the
carbonation
there
was
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
which
could
be
a
product
of
the
carbonation
or
of
that
fact
that
parisians
dont
know
how
to
properly
wash
their
beer
glasses
50cl
can
this
is
an
amber
beer
clear
in
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
the
beer
is
very
fizzy
lots
of
bubbles
clinging
to
the
glassvery
much
soda
like
in
its
carbonation
after
the
head
finally
died
down
i
got
a
whiff
it
is
sweet
a
sugary
kind
of
sweet
slight
caramel
to
the
nose
the
sugariness
come
through
in
the
taste
also
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
sweetness
hides
the
alcohol
really
not
that
good
at
all
its
even
too
sweet
for
a
buzz
beer
not
bad
for
a
strong
lager
very
hard
to
find
not
amazend
me
strange
and
difficult
malty
aroma
and
flavor
very
sweet
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
and
its
not
a
plus
slightly
saturated
i
would
not
return
to
this
beer
honestly
there
is
no
reason
to
drink
this
beyond
getting
drunk
fast
there
is
nothing
really
revolting
about
this
but
neither
is
there
anything
good
overall
this
beer
does
not
seem
to
be
designed
for
people
who
actually
enjoy
drinking
beer
people
who
enjoy
getting
drunk
possibly
might
like
it
as
it
gets
the
job
done
quickly
if
a
little
unpleasantly
the
strength
of
kanon
definitely
earns
its
namesake
with
the
power
thats
twice
that
of
the
standard
pilsner
this
lands
the
beer
somewhere
between
samichlaus
helles
and
a
plethora
of
american
microbrewed
imperial
pilsners
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nose
while
it
seemed
way
overdone
muddy
and
forced
some
of
the
notes
enlivened
the
nostrils
the
flavoring
suffered
from
being
overly
boozy
and
you
really
had
a
hard
time
getting
past
that
to
find
much
of
anything
at
all
had
they
been
willing
to
subdue
that
a
bit
more
it
could
have
potentially
been
a
much
more
curious
complex
drink
maybe
this
works
for
someone
who
wants
to
get
drunk
fast
and
doesnt
care
about
taste
but
ill
pass
poured
from
a
300
ml
bottle
minimal
head
that
also
dissapeared
straight
away
colour
is
clean
dark
yellow
strong
taste
expected
from
the
high
alcohol
but
other
than
that
nothing
midly
carbonated
its
okay
if
you
have
difficulties
to
go
to
sleep
although
you
have
already
drunk
a
bunch
of
normal
lagers
sent
to
me
in
care
package
from
the
netherlands
this
is
a
beer
that
looks
great
the
can
that
is
and
is
obviously
for
the
comsumer
to
get
drunk
fast
why
else
brew
a
11
7
lager
that
being
said
this
beer
is
not
as
bad
as
other
reviewers
have
said
it
is
slightly
sweet
but
the
alcohol
is
not
that
pronounced
i
got
hops
off
the
nose
and
a
decent
midbody
i
drank
it
out
of
the
can
at
first
but
once
i
realized
it
wasnt
terrible
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
way
too
much
abv
for
the
style
but
drinkable
d
its
not
i
had
a
few
sips
and
had
to
toss
it
very
disappointing
i
got
this
bottle
free
when
i
was
at
a
beer
fest
and
i
can
say
i
am
happy
i
did
not
spend
money
on
it
but
am
not
sad
that
i
at
least
got
to
try
it
cheers
to
them
drinkability
is
low
all
booze
and
no
real
taste
otherwise
overall
this
must
be
the
worst
beer
i
ever
had
pure
ethanol
and
other
solvents
nothing
else
tastes
and
smells
like
nail
polish
not
a
very
pleasing
drink
i
cant
tell
what
the
grolsch
brewers
were
trying
to
do
but
this
beer
didnt
turn
out
so
well
tried
this
one
a
day
ago

hmm
just
what
youd
think
strong
little
in
the
way
of
anything
but
alcohol
and
still
pretty
decent
the
smell
gives
away
its
strength
but
the
taste
is
not
nearly
as
harsh
as
one
might
expect
and
like
someone
else
said
there
was
in
fact
some
relatively
good
lacing
on
the
glass
ahem
well
good
bang
for
your
buck
taste
is
aaaah
alcohol
burning
alcohol
the
kind
that
burns
a
hole
in
your
stomach
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
covering
up
some
of
the
alcohol
but
not
enough
to
give
the
beer
whiskeylike
booziness
other
than
the
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
tastes
there
is
not
much
else
going
on
after
1
bottle
i
feel
a
big
cannon
stampeding
through
my
head
and
i
feel
that
this
is
a
one
time
experience
not
bad
but
alcohol
is
not
the
reason
to
drink
beer
id
normally
try
and
find
at
least
one
positive
thing
to
say
about
a
beer
but
with
this
one
its
difficult
its
simpy
so
unbalanced
the
appearance
is
good
just
look
at
it
for
a
while
then
pour
it
down
the
sink
this
was
a
very
fresh
brew
thanks
to
my
great
son
studying
overseas
in
amsterdam
he
brought
this
back
home
for
the
unique
chance
to
enjoy
beware
the
cannon
this
ridiculously
strong
beer
pours
a
very
thin
head
about
18
the
head
is
persistent
though
its
color
is
a
lovely
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
fine
bubbles
rising
along
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
sweet
overpowering
alcoholic
experience
the
alcohol
is
very
strong
in
the
mouth
lingering
long
after
swallowing
it
has
a
bitter
almost
pilsnerlike
taste
originally
sold
in
halfliter
bottles
it
was
brought
back
by
popular
demand
but
now
in
the
cowardly
30cl
euro
bottles
if
youre
not
aware
of
the
strength
of
this
beer
and
you
drink
it
too
fast
and
then
try
to
stand
up
you
immediately
will
sit
down
hence
kanon
cant
really
say
much
more
some
alcohol
traces
but
even
those
were
masked
by
the
overpowering
sweetness
of
the
brew
i
normally
enjoy
malty
sweet
brews
but
this
was
too
much
overall
not
as
good
as
their
admiral
stronger
with
more
sweet
malt
flavors
but
without
the
hop
bitterness
to
act
as
balance
yeah
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
but
not
flavor
that
make
me
want
to
go
back
for
more
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
appearance
the
head
actually
showed
nice
retention
and
color
making
the
beer
seem
rather
inviting
it
really
fell
apart
from
there
as
the
flavoring
was
intensely
sweet
there
was
actually
a
benefit
to
this
in
that
it
helped
to
mask
the
alcohol
pretty
well
other
than
that
it
decimated
all
other
traces
of
flavoring
and
overwhelmed
the
drinker
this
beer
lacks
balance
and
depth
d
low
again
too
sweet
and
molasses
overall
way
to
sweet
like
most
strong
grolsch
beers
not
worth
trying
dtoo
sweet
and
a
level
under
many
of
the
other
strong
lagers
one
can
buy
for
the
same
price
this
beer
has
one
purpose
and
thats
to
get
tanked
on
this
is
not
refreshing
or
complex
its
just
got
a
high
abv
light
and
easy
to
drink
lager
but
its
9
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
gives
scotland
and
tennents
a
bad
name
overall
tennents
super
strong
lager
is
not
a
beer
id
recommend
to
beer
drinkers
who
have
access
to
superior
representations
of
the
strong
lagermalt
liquor
styles
but
if
you
find
yourself
in
delhi
with
65
rupees
about
1

in
your
pocket
you
might
pick
up
a
can
you
could
certainly
do
a
lot
worse
here
330ml
bottle
from
local
bar
in
calabria
italy
pours
a
golden
copper
with
a
medium
slowly
dissipating
white
head
aroma
of
toasted
double
malted
malts
barley
grains
with
some
strong
tones
of
fruity
alcohol
esters
palate
is
a
medium
to
full
body
slightly
astringent
dry
mouth
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
a
combination
of
toasted
malt
grains
ending
with
a
good
amount
of
boozy
alcohol
fruity
notes
overall
a
bit
boozy
and
sweet
an
interesting
brew
to
try
once
very
difficult
to
drink
a
real
downer
drain
pour
o
this
is
no
more
than
a
classic
uninteresting
industrial
lager
that
has
been
on
steroids
that
alcoholic
feel
does
not
help
drinkability
overall
this
is
still
a
fairly
decent
beer
mostly
due
to
its
strong
body
and
feel
anyway
the
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
considering
how
much
the
smell
resembled
american
malt
liquor
its
more
like
someone
actually
took
the
time
to
craft
a
good
tasting
malt
liquor
while
still
capturing
everything
a
malt
liquor
should
be
its
like
those
that
brewed
it
actuallly
tasted
it
before
putting
it
out
on
the
market
its
got
malty
sweetness
and
surprisingly
some
hops
to
balance
it
out
but
its
also
got
that
alcohol
bite
that
i
just
love
in
a
strong
transparent
lager
like
this
that
alcohol
tastes
got
nowhere
to
hide
it
has
just
a
hint
of
a
fusel
bite
on
the
finish
with
caramel
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
its
the
way
a
strong
lager
should
finish
once
again
american
macros
are
beaten
into
the
dust
by
their
european
competitors
will
they
ever
learn
picked
it
up
in
naples
because
i
thought
it
was
recommended
and
whats
not
to
like
about
a
strong
beer
average
look
and
smell
not
much
different
that
nay
other
macre
euro
lager
maybe
a
a
bit
less
skunkier
than
a
warm
heinekin
taste
is
apparent
of
alcohol
not
exactly
a
pleasant
taste
but
i
suppose
it
is
made
to
smack
you
down
like
a
mickeys
big
mouth
mouthfeel
is
below
average
the
alcohol
doesnt
improve
the
feel
overall
a
low
quality
beer
but
at
least
i
wont
waste
another
euro
testing
it
out
dif
you
have
2
pounds
and
want
to
get
drunk
you
could
do
worse
you
could
also
do
a
lot
better
overall
wont
be
seeking
it
out
but
its
no
that
bad
dont
be
hatin
on
the
soupy
recommended
only
for
borderline
alcoholics
from
west
central
scotland
like
me
i
warned
you
pairs
well
with
a
2am
kebabs
night
buses
and
that
waffle
stand
outside
finsbury
park
tube
station
this
is
not
a
fine
handcrafted
ale
but
it
doesnt
pretend
to
be
unpretentious
and
certainly
tolerable
seems
like
a
novelty
beer
and
just
meant
to
get
you
schnockered
very
mediocre
for
this
my
500th
review
ive
chosen
a
beer
befitting
the
economic
climate
nothing
says
im
broke
and
desperate
like
malt
liquor
this
one
is
annoyingly
attractive
much
betterlooking
than
it
needs
or
deserves
to
be
with
a
honeyamber
body
and
a
poofy
thick
creamcolored
crop
of
foam
that
retains
surprisingly
well
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
the
aroma
is
that
it
smells
fairly
safe
actually
the
word
aroma
is
a
bit
too
fancy
for
this
beer
what
it
actually
has
is
an
odor
an
odor
of
cornbread
this
beer
tastes
like
a
hangover

the
only
reason

is
that
it
is

popular
with
the
neds
when
they
want
a
change
from
bucky
looks
ok
i
spose
decent

with
a

colour
was
a
very
dull

quite
pale
supersweet
with
heaps
of
alcohol
showing
stewed

boiled
veggies
and
just
too
much
alcohol
and
metal
in
there
quite
sticky
aswell
and
a
thin
harsh
mouthfeel
very
difficult
to
drink
a
beer
absolutely
to
avoid
not
a
good
beer
infact
an
awful
beer
tennents
super
is
one
that
surely
needs
a
warning
label
plastered
on
it
its
toxic
and
a
serious
hazard
to
anyone
brave
or
foolish
enuff
to
drink
it
if
you
see
this
on
your
bottleo
shelf
look
away
immediately
yes
it
did
skunk
a
bit
but
it
has
a
special
tennents
flavor
that
i
find
pleasing
the
look
was
dark
gold
with
a
big
head
that
left
too
soon
but
did
lace
a
bit
against
the
somewhat
bitter
background
came
a
swell
of
alcohol
that
said
sip
this
one
dont
gulp
it
so
sip
i
did
overall
much
better
than
typical
american
macros
but
too
potent
for
a
session
my
guess
is
that
most
american
drinkers
will
rate
this
higher
than
our
uk
brethren
since
to
us
its
better
than
bud
and
to
them
its
nothing
like
their
very
fine
high
quality
regional
ales
yikes
this
is
the
strongest
lager
i
have
ever
had
and
its
by
far
the
nastiest
one
whiff
of
it
and
i
knew
what
i
was
in
for
i
have
never
seen
a
lager
at
9
and
it
tasted
like
9
it
was
disgusting
if
you
ever
find
this
crap
stay
away
stay
far
far
away
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you
on
that
quote
sneaked
it
into
our
hotel
room
not
that
they
probably
cared
this
beer
has
an
alcohol
level
that
just
slams
you
in
the
face
at
the
first
aroma
the
beer
was
a
yellow
color
with
no
lace
and
was
fairly
clear
the
aroma
was
the
usual
corn
or
whatever
that
crazy
lager
smell
is
the
flavor
is
just
impossible
to
hold
on
to
because
the
alcohol
just
cuts
through
everything
including
the
finish
creating
quite
a
bite
to
it
basically
a
beer
for
getting
trashed
fast
had
this
on
tap
in
europe
it
will
kick
your
ass
pretty
decent
beer
overall
nice
and
strong
quite
flavorful
kinda
sweet
not
bad
at
all
if
your
boss
is
a
lazy
prick
who
doesnt
care
about
presentation
benefits
or
general
tastefulness
then
the
name
of
this
beer
is
well
suited
i
drink
this
as
i
write
this
review
and
much
like
a
horrible
job
with
said
boss
it
gets
worse
with
every
sip
like
every
passing
day
is
worse
than
the
last
i
refuse
to
stop
however
because
i
did
pay
for
this
and
i
desire
the
effects
of
a
promised
8
abv
disappointing
considering
that
the
black
boss
porter
rates
rather
well
with
me
this
never
again
only
thing
that
saves
this
is
high
abv
which
is
inflated
due
to
euro
measuring
standards
cereal
sweet
and
floral
and
cereal
before
i
even
sip
it
i
must
say
the
abv
has
to
be
the
best
thing
about
this
one
no
if
you
can
get
it
down
from
bourbon
county
to
this
kind
of
like
the
state
of
our
nation
no
could
this
be
the
obama
of
the
beer
world
i
also
want
to
state
that
i
did
not
capitalize
his
name
above
damned
democrat
spell
checker
barf
beer
at
its
best
last
beer
of
the
evening
for
me
figured
id
get
rid
of
the
garbage
and
i
know
because
i
had
the
black
one
a
few
weeks
ago
took
all
i
had
to
grab
this
one
from
the
frig
and
being
partly
polish
i
am
utterly
ashamed
of
their
beer
making
prowess
this
might
have
been
a
winner
when
i
was
15
and
pimping
beer
but
geez
this
stuff
is
garbage
now
that
i
understand
what
beer
can
taste
like
blehhh
does
that
translate
to
a
number
if
youre
reading
this
right
now
youre
too
close
i
mean
seriously
if
youre
reading
this
right
now
you
must
have
bought
this
crap
like
i
did
im
sorry
just
remember
friends
dont
let
friends
drink
ht
beer
save
the
world
slap
it
out
of
their
hands
if
you
see
them
reach
for
it
aaahhhggg
barf
i
believe
i
have
sufficient
legal
grounds
to
sue
total
wine
for
selling
me
this
put
it
back
and
move
to
another
country
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite

that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on

of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
minerals
slight
smoke
and
pickle
or
cucumber
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
vegetal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
quite
a
poor
beer
with
a
really
weird
picklelike
smell
and
flavors
that
make
this
one
a
chore
to
drink
overall
not
among
my
favorite
beers
i
think
this
bad
boy
is
going
to
be
a
drain
pour
an
okay
brew
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
not
overpowering
with
its
alcohol
content
as
far
as
flavor
goes
id
drink
it
again
but
it
probably
just
would
not
be
my
first
choice
if
other
options
were
available

a
sweet
grainy
flavor
with
a
honey
aftertaste
very
little
if
any
alcohol
flavor
nicely
hidden
for
the
higher
abv
this
is
a
really
tasty
easy
drinking
high
abv
beer
i
like
black
boss
porter
and
i
am
digging
this
beer
as
well
a
solid
beer
for
under
2
tough
to
beat
that
deal
overall
looks
like
i
will
be
stocking
up
on
this
one
for
the
warm
weather
and
the
black
boss
porter
for
the
cold
weather
months
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
there
was
nothing
majorly
offensive
everything
about
it
was
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
adjuncts
were
highly
detectable
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
making
this
a
bland
choice
an
ok
drinkability
syrupy
and
sticky
some
extract
flavors
take
away
a
bit
and
not
as
crisp
and
clean
as
a
lager
should
be
drinkability
my
only
experience
in
this
style
is
mocne
and
baltika
9
this
is
way
better
than
both
of
those
that
said
it
is
still
not
a
favorite
the
honey
taste
is
above
average
but
this
beer
is
too
sweet
a
little
hops
to
counterbalance
that
would
go
a
long
way
with
this
beer
above
average
for
style
ok
for
beer
the
body
was
good
fuller
than
most
lagers
and
a
little
heavier
the
body
also
was
not
as
crisp
but
the
fullness
nicely
countered
that
drinkability
was
very
good
although
at
8
1
its
not
exactly
a
lawnmower
beer
you
could
have
a
couple
of
these
enjoyably
and
its
a
beer
you
might
keep
a
couple
of
around
for
when
youre
in
the
mood
i
suspect
youll
be
in
the
mood
regularly
drinkability
dont
bother
this
is
just
a
highalcohol
adjunct
lager
you
can
get
this
quality
for
much
cheaper
in
the
states
this
is
one
occasion
to
forget
about
poland
drinkability
this
is
the
easiest
drinking
beer
ive
had
for
its
abv
bar
none
that
being
said
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
to
this
one
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
quaffable
but
not
this
brewerys
best
beer
try
their
porterblack
boss
much
better
notes
from
and
tasted
on
121205
let
this
one
air
out
a
bit
the
skunk
went
away
pretty
much
sweet
grain
in
the
aroma
huge
metallic
twang
in
the
taste
this
ones
going
down
the
drain
pours
with
practically
no
head
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
and
smellslooks
like
malt
liquor
take
a
sip
even
tastes
like
malt
liquor
it
isnt
terrible
the
8
abv
is
very
well
hidden
but
the
beer
doesnt
taste
too
good
either
basically
if
you
want
a
cheap
strong
beer
that
isnt
offensive
give
this
one
a
whirl
my
first
stab
at
a
euro
strong
lager
i
think
ill
avoid
this
category
in
the
future
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
but
definitely
a
solid
strong
lager
and
better
than
many
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
i
could
easily
see
drinking
this
one
again
as
the
flavor
isnt
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
the
abv
is
essentially
hidden
not
outstanding
but
definitely
not
bad
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
find
a
good
deal
on
it
d
for
the
price
this
is
worth
picking
up
plus
its
from
poland
throw
on
some
chopin
vader
riverside
behemoth
decapitated
rip
sceptic
nyia
or
any
other
great
music
from
the
motherland
and
enjoy
overall
not
that
impressive
this
beer
is
a
nice
pale
wheat
color
and
smelled
of
malt
and
grains
it
had
little
head
and
some
lacing
that
fades
quickly
tastes
of
malt
and
honey
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
and
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
brew
with
all
the
lager
characteristics
and
a
little
more
oomph
pours
a
hazed
gold
with
almost
no
head
nose
is
of
grain
and
alcohol
typical
stuff
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
sweet
overall
tone
to
it
but
not
so
overly
sweet
that
it
overpowers
slight
corn
taste
it
seems
but
overall
just
a
smooth
lager
feel
is
nice
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
goes
down
smooth
highly
drinkable
sure
it
is
a
typical
old
lager
but
these
guys
go
down
smooth
and
even
could
sit
with
these
all
night

it

flavour
sweet

rather
honeyishmarshmallow
even
the
barest
hint
of

somewhat
salty
not
bad
on
the
palate
heavy
but
smooth
enough
far
far
better
than
any
of
its
american
cousins
the
malt
liquors
emptied
it
steadily
i
could
drink
this
stuff
every
day
may
be
my
1
micro
lager
for
a
while
boss
beer
doesnt
come
close
to
the
quality
of
black
boss
porter
but
then
i
didnt
really
think
it
would
it
deserves
credit
more
for
what
it
isnt
a
typically
rough
esl
than
for
what
it
is
expectations
are
easily
exceeded
when
they
arent
that
high
to
begin
with
pours
with
almost
no
head
very
little
carbonation
just
lighter
than
a
standard
amber
lager
in
color
light
hoppy
odor
light
malty
taste
and
texture
alcohol
level
is
just
slightly
noticeable
very
easy
to
drink
not
quite
as
strong
as
a
barleywine
but
noticeably
stronger
than
your
standard
lager
good
stuff
theres
obviously
a
good
bit
of
adjunct
to
this
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
obvious
a
cooler
fermentation
seems
to
be
in
order
still
its
pretty
typical
of
a
strong
lager
from
eastern
europe
ie
latvia
lithuania
russian
federation
etc
and
it
can
be
enjoyable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
it
pours
a
bright
golden
color
topped
by
a
bright
white
head
that
vanishes
after
about
a
minute
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
robust
fruity
hops
palate
is
rich
and
sweet
with
a
medium
malt
profile
that
has
notes
of
turbinado
sugar
and
sweet
pomaceous
fruit
body
is
nice
and
creamy
very
enjoyable
for
such
a
strong
lager
not
something
ill
drink
every
day
but
a
good
change
of
pace
drinkability
clearly
crafted
in
a
german
mold
this
is
a
very
sweet
lager
it
lacks
depth
and
is
not
much
fun
to
drink
on
its
own
but
it
would
do
nicely
with
sausage
in
fact
it
would
be
perfect
for
cooking
brats
good
imperial
pilsner
rather
malty
its
hops
though
very
present
they
seem
to
contribute
more
on
its
flavor
and
aroma
than
its
bitterness
well
executed
brew
that
grows
overtime
they
were
able
to
make
an
imperial
pilsner
that
is
more
accepted
by
beginners
and
still
satisfying
for
the
initiated
a
very
odd
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
brown
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
funky
and
raw
kind
of
musty
the
taste
is
of
something
thats
been
sitting
in
a
basement
for
50
years
or
so
all
decayed
malt
with
some
hints
of
hop
shine
long
gone
but
for
all
that
kind
of
interesting
the
carbonation
is
all
but
gone
but
its
lighter
in
the
mouth
than
id
expected
again
an
odd
beer
but
one
thatd
suit
those
who
like
old
oddities
o
not
overly
enjoyable
though
not
terrible
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
suspect
the
fact
that
this
was
an
older
bottle
might
have
skewed
the
review
a
bit
but
it
was
rather
disappointing
however
if
i
was
in
a
small
dutch
village
for
the
night
i
could
get
merrily
drunk
on
this
beer
there
is
a
nice
flavor
generated
by
the
hops
with
a
tealike
herbal
and
lemony
taste
the
malt
is
slightly
toasty
with
gentle
sweetish
tinge
which
is
characteristic
of
the
pilsner
malt
with
light
bitter
taste
in
the
finish
and
very
mild
taste
of
alcohol
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
the
style
like
an
imperial
pils
with
smooth
body
and
nice
crrisp
presence
it
is
easy
to
drink
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
it
contains
and
i
would
definitely
order
it
again
o
it
started
off
very
interesting
but
then
turned
as
boring
as
most
euro
strong
lagers
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
hazy
looking
golden
color
with
a
some
sediment
floating
around
in
there
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
once
it
settled
the
lacing
stuck
to
the
glass
fairly
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
hoppy
full
of
nobel
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
the
greatest
but
it
was
hoppy
but
still
very
earthy
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
on
the
heavier
side
which
was
interesting
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
better
than
most
typicval
euro
strong
lagers
however
i
dont
see
myself
having
to
buy
it
again
think
i
mightve
gotten
a
bum
one
here
i
let
this
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
poured
with
a
decent
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
that
was
short
lived
some
yeast
sediment
and
no
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
brown
aroma
is
yeast
raisins
other
fruit
malt
flavor
is
like
now
but
big
raisin
sweetness
countering
the
tartness
and
yeast
bitterness
no
hop
noticable
anywhere
body
was
full
and
thick
with
ok
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
longish
would
like
to
try
a
good
one
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
restaurant
right
now
just
to
get
another
one
i
just
got
back
from
that
place
decent
enough
but
not
something
id
ever
want
to
drink
again
cloudy
yellowish
amber
white

dense

nice

left
perfumed

fresh

sharp
dry
bitterness
alcoholic
presence
is
felt
oilyresiny
woody
finish
medium
body
but
a
little
fat
in
mouth
drinkability
is
ok
o
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
no
reference
point
for
this
style
but
i
bizarrely
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
expected
o
interesting
taste
a
little
too
dry
for
my
liking
the
herbal
flavours
start
creeping
in
as
the
beer
warms
nice
to
try
but
the
bitterness
would
put
me
off
drinking
any
more
of
these
edit
after
reading
what
a
strong
lager
actually
is
i
can
not
even
compare
this
to
what
is
listed
this
is
hands
down
the
best
strong
lager
pours
a
cloudy
dark
gold
with
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
leaving
heavy
white
lace
down
the
glass
very
nice
distinct
noble
hop
aroma
and
flavor
spicy
and
herbal
lots
of
alcohol
on
this
one
too
the
8
7
abv
really
comes
through
warming
yet
refreshing
a
nice
nobel
brew
overall
nothing
i
would
buy
or
try
again
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
overall
a
nice
strong
euro
that
is
a
nice
step
away
from
my
normal
pick
of
brews
would
i
go
out
and
drink
this
one
again
probably
not
but
it
was
still
worth
a
try
and
a
nice
offering
from
this
dutch
brewer
excellent
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
good
clean
crisp
flavor
again
grass
and
clean
crisp
metalic
bitterness
this
a
fine
pilsner
in
my
opinion
i
know
they
say
its
a
lager
but
it
drinks
like
a
fine
pilsner
maybe
an
imperial
with
the
high
abv
but
it
drinks
really
well
so
watch
out
for
that
high
abv
overall
a
tasty
beer
with
great
mouthfeel
and
appearance
exceeded
my
expectations
would
class
this
more
along
the
line
of
an
imperial
pils
the
carbonation
seemed
a
little
light
during
the
pour
so
i
agitated
it
a
bit
to
get
a
thick
short
layer
of
whitish
cap
lots
of
sticky
lacing
and
great
head
retention
the
beer
was
a
hazy
lemon
colour
really
fruity
aroma
up
front
sort
of
like
sweet
tart
candies
but
this
faded
into
a
mix
of
grassy
lemony
spicy
hops
and
pils
malt
hints
of
pineapple
and
honey
the
flavour
was
good
too
balanced
bitterness
with
lots
of
fruity
hops
some
toasted
malts
honey
and
cereal
the
texture
was
soft
and
velvety
up
front
lowish
carbonation
medium
bodied
towards
the
finish
there
were
some
solvent
notes
stronger
bitterness
mild
spiciness
and
faint
tropical
fruits
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
were
evident
in
the
finish
overall
pretty
solid
lots
of
hop
character
with
some
tasty
malts
you
cant
argue
with
that
thanks
sammy
pours
a
pale
orangishyellow
unfiltered
and
almost
hefeweizenlike
in
appearance
less
than
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
lots
of
lace
and
decent
retention
nose
is
bursting
with
citrus
almost
resembles
five
alive
exactly
lots
of
grassiness
and
a
hint
of
urine
taste
has
more
grassiness
and
citrusy
lemony
and
grassy
hops
some
orange
as
well
feels
like
someone
has
added
alcohol
to
a
glass
of
five
alive
really
i
cant
get
this
comparison
out
of
my
head
carbonation
is
high
fairly
average
mouthfeel
bitterness
is
short
and
lingers
momentarily
no
alcohol
detectable
in
this
interesting
but
almost
synthetic
at
times
with
this
being
readily
available
and
fairly
cheap
i
pick
this
up
every
once
ina
while
and
ill
always
enjoy
it
listing
as
a
lager
strikes
me
as
being
odd
this
seems
more
like
a
belgian
style
ipa
d
this
is
a
conundrum
a
tasty
and
somewhat
unique
beer
but
one
i
probably
wont
seek
out
again
not
bad
sweetness
could
be
an
issue
good
carbonation
and
found
it
to
be
really
drinkable
for
the
alc
well
balanced
flavours
and
lingering
finish
that
is
both
sweet
yet
bitter
delightfully
dry
hopped
leaning
towards
my
personal
apa
preferences
and
definitely
a
beer
ill
purchase
again
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
colour
soapy
white
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
smells
of
malt
and
not
really
much
else
faint
alcohol
some
dry
hops
are
noticeable
it
is
clean
smelling
but
nothing
special
taste
is
malty
grassy
dryleafy
hops
finishes
dry
with
earthy
tones
solid
weight
and
mouthfeel
crisp
with
ok
carbonation
abv
in
this
isnt
noticeable
and
drinks
pretty
good
but
i
probably
will
save
the
3
bucks
next
time
and
pass
on
this
one
i
really
wish
the
lcbo
would
bring
in
less
mediocre
eurotrash
when
there
are
so
many
good
beers
from
other
provinces
and
across
the
border
available
im
done
with
this
brewery
now
drink
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
was
okay
but
there
lots
of
other
beers
i
would
have
rather
been
drinking
d
its
a
fairly
pleasant
way
to
tick
the
euro
strong
lager
category
but
i
probably
wont
bother
with
this
one
unless
i
could
verify
freshness
perhaps
it
will
show
up
ontap
somewhere
in
the
future
d
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
changeup
not
exactly
sure
what
to
make
of
the
style
its
kind
of
odd
but
solid
the
best
way
i
can
describe
this
beer
is
a
doppelbock
made
with
very
light
malts
with
a
touch
of
belgian
blonde
ale
extremely
unique
and
pretty
interesting
not
sure
if
im
crazy
about
it
but
drinkable
this
monstrosity
should
have
never
ever
made
it
into
bottles
nice
aroma
but
overall
a
terrible
beer
the
abv
makes
this
a
beer
for
only
1
or
2
bottle
or
glasses
but
very
enjoyable
d
this
is
in
my
opinion
a
really
really
enjoyable
pilsner
i
think
the
age
really
muted
the
abv
on
this
this
would
be
a
refreshing
beer
at
6
let
along
8
7
ill
definately
be
buying
this
again
and
sharing
with
friends
d
decent
beer
but
the
overtly
boozy
flavours
on
my
tongue
ruins
this
one
for
me
it
would
be
easy
to
suggest
this
beer
with
pub
fare
or
bbq
but
i
actually
think
that
it
is
lacking
the
caramel
and
charred
flavors
to
properly
match
bbq
and
it
is
a
bit
to
bitter
and
tart
for
pub
far
i
would
really
enjoy
the
nobel
alone
and
allow
it
to
quench
you
fully
and
it
will
granted
this
bottle
is
probably
36
months
old
so
perhaps
there
was
some
more
hopping
originally
as
is
this
is
a
miss
d
enjoyable
but
the
abv
hinders
this
beer
taste
again
minimal
hops
despite
advertising
itself
otherwise
does
have
a
nice
bitterness
that
lingers
that
is
unique
dry
impressed
how
well
the
alcohol
was
hidden
seems
to
havce
too
much
flavor
for
a
pilsner
this
is
one
of
those
exceptions
i
guess
geez
if
they
really
delivered
as
promised
with
the
hops
this
would
be
a
great
not
just
good
beer
d
this
beer
would
be
alot
easier
to
drink
if
the
alcohol
were
masked
by
a
more
generous
dose
of
hops
but
i
could
definately
see
myself
getting
through
a
few
in
a
night
without
any
problems

i
tried
this
beer
on
april
30
2009
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
was
grainy
malt
and
a
piney
hoppish
note
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
grainy
malt
some
citrusy
lemon
notes
and
a
hoppy
bitter
finish
this
beer
is
definitely
some
very
tasty
stuff
with
a
heavy
yeast
component
and
welcome
blast
of
hop
spice
that
is
accompanied
by
a
nice
round
body
for
the
style
i
guess
my
experience
with
triple
lagers
is
pretty
minimal
though
highly
recommended
this
is
a
seductive
imperial
pilsner
with
no
hint
of
its
strength
in
the
flavor
profile
i
understand
why
the
330ml
bottle
this
is
so
smooth
and
tasty
youd
like
to
session
it
but
beware
this
kicks
duvels
ass
for
flavor

for

it

pours
a
slightly

with

lingering
in
the
background
considering
its
8
this
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
i
didnt
taste
any
of
the
abv
a
pretty
solid
pilsner
overall
good
stuff
overall
a
tasty
option
when
yearning
for
1
or
2
pints
of
something
relatively
light
but
flavourful
in
this
warmer
weather
especially
given
the
reasonable
pricepoint
at
the
lcbo
will
definitely
reach
for
this
semiregularly
throughout
the
summer
months
pours
the
colour
of
peach
juice
and
opaque
with
lees
held
in

the
head
is
just
a
little
bit
retentive
but
doesnt

a
few
chunky
looking
floaties
can
be
seen
in
my
glass

aromatic
and
reminiscent
of
baked

down

theres

with

character
the
hop
flavour
is
lemony
and
spicy
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
little
bit
of
linger
unpleasantly
boozy
if
it
warms
too
much
i
drank
my
first
two
bottles
of
this
too
warm
and
found
myself
dreading
the
third
after
a
month
here
i
am
drinking
the
third
one
at
a
cooler
temperature
and
finding
it
quite
enjoyable
fullbodied
with
somewhat
low
carbonation
feels
heavy
this
is
much
better
than
my
first
impression
of
it
im
still
not
sure
if
i
want
any
more
of
it
i
think
id
rather
wait
for
the
christoffel
blondebier
the
lcbo
is
carrying
this
summer
theres
no
doubt
christoffel
make
quality
products
and
while
this
lager
is
well
in
excess
of
the
abv
id
usually
drink
for
the
style
i
found
it
to
be
a
pleasant
experience
would
i
buy
again
probably
not
but
i
wont
rule
it
out
definitely
worth
trying
definitely
an
interesting
pilsener
and
certainly
not
christawful
as
its
name
would
suggest
though
i
feel
this
brew
does
present
some
flaws
i
cant
claim
this
to
be
all
too
drinkable
its
a
sipper
at
best
i
cant
see
myself
ever
wanting
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
and
dont
think
ill
be
buying
it
again
of
the
two
pilseners
sampled
here
id
have
to
say
i
definitely
prefer
the
original
pilsener
urquell
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
carbonation
is
a
little
lacking
drinkability
is
only
average
due
to
the
alcohol
i
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
overall
for
one
thing
it
doesnt
really
know
if
its
a
strong
pilsener
or
a
strong
belgian
pale
there
are
characters
of
both
here
and
they
clash
more
than
a
little
it
doesnt
have
the
body
for
a
belgian
strong
or
belgian
ipa
nor
does
it
have
the
crisp
drinkability
of
a
good
highlyhopped
pilsener
it
takes
the
middle
ground
and
as
a
result
ends
up
being
pretty
average

ac
is
evident
in
the
silky
smoothness
the
taste
doesnt
vary
much
and
is
quite
consistent
throughout
bitter
with
a
pineylike
finish
the
mouth
feel
although
it
starts
very
viscous
has
good
carbonation
kicking
in
at
the
end
for
a
nice
sparkly
yet
bitter
aftertaste
pilsener
woah
this
is
a
good
brew
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
pairing
with
spicy
seafood
d
i
enjoy
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
couldnt
imagine
this
is
a
pilsener
though
to
me
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
nice
spritzy
carbonated
feel
and
overall
very
refreshing
especially
for
the
8
7
alcohol
one
of
the
best
pilseners
ive
had
very
unique
i
would
try
this
again
for
sure
what
a
smack
upside
the
senses
definitely
a
surprise
tasty
and
big
but
balanced
all
around
and
given
the
near
9
points
of
abv
would
suggest
more
of
an
imperial
czech
pilsener
d
very
drinkable
interesting
and
tasty
brew
well
done
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
easy
to
drink
with
its
fairly
high
carbonation
frothy
body
light
and
airy
very
crisp
and
dry
a
great
drink
that
would
pair
lovely
with
a
ricotta
and
spinach
lasagna
pasta
dish
with
a
tomato
based
sauce
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
damn
smooth
for
its
abv
some
warmth
going
down
nice
stuff
if
you
want
a
hopped
up
big
alcohol
imperial

this
is
a
great

booze
warms
the

but
i
cant
detect
it
in
the
flavour
a
kick
ass
czech
pilsner
packed
with
noble
hop
goodness
not
a
bad
little
brew
i
quite
enjoyed
it
certainly
threw
off
my
perceptions
of
a
pilsner
strong
but
the
alcohol
indetectible
making
this
a
dangerous
beer
a
good
sipper
but
the
abv
and
the
sweetness
reduces
its
drinkability
worth
a
go
bottle
poured
a
slightly
hazy
bright
yellow
color
beer
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
dry
noble
hops
notes
taste
is
also
a
somewhat
unbalanced
mix
between
some
dry
hopped
saaz
and
some
overly
sweet
malt
notes
with
a
hint
of
cereal
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
kinda
like
the
idea
of
a
hoppier
christoffel
but
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
buds
overall
a
nice
smelling
beer
that
tastes
okay
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
or
repeating
for
me
unless
i
could
try
it
fresh
i
glass
is
fine
for
me
this
is
a
tough
beer
id
definitely
recommend
it
though
if
this
beer
displayed
a
better
head
with
a
good
amount
of
retention
and
lace
it
would
be
outstanding
but
of
course
the
appearance
doesnt
take
away
from
the
taste
and
smell
and
thats
where
this
beer
really
stands
out
i
cant
believe
this
is
8
7
abv
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
would
indicate
such
a
high
alcohol
content
well
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
in
to
pilsners
if
hops
and
alcohol
were
people
and
this
beer
a
bed
it
would
be
like
trying
to
cram
a
dozen
bodies
into
a
twin
i
dont
know
what
gave
this
dutch
brewery
the
idea
to
dryhop
their
pilsner
and
then
doubledown
on
the
alcohol
but
im
glad
they
went
ahead
with
it
it
wasnt
an
easy
experiment
to
pull
off
but
they
did
it
good
work
christoffel
drinkability
i
found
it
adequate
for
better
or
worse
its
a
beer
that
goes
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
style
this
beer
is
surprisingly
smooth
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
at
all
there
is
no
aftertaste
just
smoothness
throughout
there
is
some
malt
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
mouth
but
overall
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
really
high
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
short
swing
top
bottle
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
disappears
shortly
leaving
moderate
lacing
smell
is
of
wheat
and
slight
alcohol
taste
is
easy
with
slight
hop
bitterness
but
nothing
outstanding
alcohol
does
not
stand
out
greatly
but
still
present
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
with
the
most
flavor
hitting
the
back
of
the
tongue
smooth
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
medium
which
follows
with
the
beer
in
general
medium
abv
medium
carbonation
overall
an
average
beer
good
but
nothing
amazing
an
enjoyable
brew
nonetheless
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
stronger
german
lagers
w
hops
had
a
bottle
for
7
at
the
bookstore
speakeasy
in
bethlehem
pa
id
say
this
qualifies
as
an
imperial
pilsner
theres
a
big
caramel
malt
body
upfront
followed
by
an
earthy
and
heavy
floral
hop
taste
than
rolls
into
a
peppery
orange
peel
finish
the
hops
are
a
little
off
balance
but
this
surprisingly
fruity
hopped
up
lager
is
worth
a
try
for
something
different
the
taste
just
slightly
falls
short
of
these
expectations
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
outstanding
in
any
way
slight
afteratset
coating
in
all
quite
good
overall
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
good
things
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
that
it
was
interesting
and
i
would
not
have
guessed
the
8
7
abv
worth
a
shot
if
youre
curious
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
glowing
golden
with
a
creamy
whitethick
head
and
excellent
lacing
a
very
pretty
beer
smells
very
grainy
with
a
little
banana
spice
and
a
fair
dose
of
herbalness
interesting
tastes
tangy
with
apple
notes
caramel
and
lots
of
herbs
followed
by
some
grain
and
banana
much
bigger
than
usual
for
the
style
and
for
that
matter
a
very
unusual
interpretation
of
the
style
but
for
all
that
fairly
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
both
spritzy
and
a
bit
grainy
and
the
combination
is
a
bit
offputting
could
be
a
little
less
sharp
and
a
lot
less
grainy
in
the
mouth
interesting
beer
but
this
certainly
wouldnt
be
my
goto
pilsner
too
big
for
its
own
good
i
can
see
the
attempt
the
brewery
wanted
to
make
a
big
good
lager
with
a
ton
of
nobel
hops
while
i
salute
the
endeavor
something
didnt
go
right
i
admit
the
possibility
that
something
could
be
wrong
with
this
particular
bottle
but
i
have
no
reason
to
think
its
been
poorly
handled
or
anything
at
any
rate
it
tastes
like
a
cheap
strong
euro
lager
or
even
an
american
malt
liquor
and
i
dearly
apologize
to
the
christoffel
brewers
who
are
probably
very
nice
gentlemen
who
know
a
ton
about
beer
and
brewing
theres
just
a
mildly
stomachturning
flavor
to
that
sweet
malt
married
to
a
lager
yeast
that
kills
it
for
me
the
boatload
of
metallic
nobel
hops
dont
bring
enough
spice
for
me
although
there
is
a
relatively
nice
grassy
quality
in
there
theres
a
funny
thick
aftertaste
that
i
dont
particularly
care
for
as
well
the
feel
isnt
bad
but
its
hard
for
me
to
get
past
the
flavor
as
a
sidenote
this
beer
tastes
little
to
nothing
like
any
czech
pilsener
that
ive
ever
tasted
anyway
its
another
beer
that
id
love
to
give
a
second
chance
particularly
if
i
ever
find
myself
at
the
brewery
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
the
best
pilsener
out
there
but
its
one
that
packs
a
good
punch
the
beer
pours
rich
dark
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
all
around
i
dont
get
a
lot
on
the
nose
just
some
light
honey
and
biscuit
aroma
while
the
flavors
generally
replicate
the
nose
there
is
a
lot
more
flavor
with
some
moderate
sweetness
and
a
kiss
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
for
a
pilsner
imo
but
for
all
that
drinkability
is
still
pretty
good
oddly
a
barnyard
aroma
and
served
way
too
cold

smokeless

peachy
colour
with
pretty
white

and
instant

you
have
to
appreciate
the
taste
for
what
it
is
a
lot
of
nobel
hops
for
that
it
is
good
green
grassy
notes
above
average
mouthfeel
walk
away
make

and
then
as
it

it
is
better
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
there
is
a
light
sweetness
to
the
beer
aftertaste
is
lingering
bitter
and
raw
hoppy
overall
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
would
rather
have
warka
strong
if
im
having
a
strong
euro
lager
booze
was
surprisingly
well
hidden

sum
of
this
beer
is
greater
than
each
of
its
parts

with

that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thick
cap
with
heavy

aroma
malty
bready
malt
slightly
sour
and
grainy
similar
to
a
somewhat
soured
bock
flavor
is
sweet
malt
grain
and
adjuncts
hints
of
apple
juice
and
diacetyl
hints
of
hops
and
oxidation
in
the
finish
mild
flavor
does
not
quite
cover
the
alcohol
tasting
like
a
fortified
light
bock
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
can
is
also
labled
malt
liquor
obviously
for
the
us
market
and
that
is
actually
a
good
description
this
tastes
like
a
slightly
maltier
adjunct
lager
fortified
for
getting
a
buzz
except
for
the
diacetyl
no
real
off
flavors
but
nothing
much
to
recommend
it
either
a
cheap
fortified
lager
needed
to
tick
this
brewery
and
style
done
and
moving
on
a
decent
mouthfeel
not
as
round
as
other
brews
o
a
good
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
of
a
sweeter
lager
but
not
too
malty
bitterness
is
what
youd
expect
of
a
lager
tolerable
and
would
go
best
with
a
heavy
meal
like
roast
beef
and
potatoes
or
sausages
the
dryness
helps
this
beers
drinkability
but
it
tends
to
drink
like
a
malt
liquor
for
the
most
part
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
i
was
in
poland
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
clear
gold
with
a
reddish
orange
tinge
shortlived
whited
head
with
almost
no
lacing
nose
is
generally
sweet
some
honey
grains
and
what
moderately
resembles
some
caramelized
malts
taste
is
just
the
same
sweet
malts
grainy
alcohol
apple
juice
and
more
alcohol
a
general
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
too
much
fusel
here
and
lackluster
flavour
a
chore
to
get
through
overall
found
this
beer
listed
in
the
book
1000
beers
you
must
try
before
you
die
well
i
tried
it
definitely
noting
to
write
home
about
i
didnt
have
any
issues
finishing
my
glass
but
its
not
something
id
seek
out
again
not
as
terrible
as
the
reviews
led
me
to
believe
but
other
than
that
there
isnt
much
to
say
you
can
certainly
drink
this
but
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
unless
you
were
just
looking
for
something
to
get
you
wasted
without
being
terribly
unpalatable
for
the
discerning
malt
liquor
connoisseur
not
something
im
likely
to
get
again
when
i
can
think
of
2
other
strong
polish
lagers
id
prefer
but
at
least
this
stuff
is
cheap
fun
fact
apparently
mocne
is
polish
for
cheap
boozy
swill
avoid
as
unimpressed
as
i
was
with
the
bottle
but
for
completely
different
reasons
have
my
tastebuds
changed
or
has
the
beer
od
avoid
this
no
way
i
would
have
it
again
saving
grace
is
the
mild
hop
presence
i
didnt
finish
the
bottle
overall
this
was
alright
polish
beers
stick
out
easily
and
pretty
distinct
in
their
flavor
which
is
highly
characteristic
of
this
beer
however
there
isnt
much
to
set
this
beer
apart
from
the
rest
other
than
me
liking
the
brewerys
porter
they
can
poke
you
with
all
different
kinds
of
instruments
but
its
still
pain
okocim
mocne
living
up
to
its
name
roughs
up
the
palate
with
more
strength
than
lesseralcohol
lagers
the
abuse
suffered
is
nowhere
worth
the
price
paid
for
it
no
matter
the
momentary
jollies
that
7
5
alcohol
might
bring
stronger
is
definitely
not
better
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
dense
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
large
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
as
impressive
as
the
appearance
it
is
grainy
sweet
malt
and
just
a
faint
wisp
of
hops
the
beer
comes
back
to
life
in
taste
not
too
sweet
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
to
balance
things
out
almost
has
a
clean
finish
but
there
is
a
little
lingering
astringency
otherwise
has
the
polish
lager
taste
the
body
is
light
despite
the
elevated
abv
good
carbonation
that
is
far
from
harsh
i
think
i
picked
this
bottle
up
right
after
it
got
off
the
truck
at
the
store
so
it
may
of
benefited
by
being
as
fresh
as
an
import
could
be
add
some
more
hops
and
this
beer
could
be
something
really
good
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
pure
white
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
adjunct
is
not
too
strong
but
not
that
pleasant
either
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
adjunct
with
light
cardboard
notes
body
is
slightly
oily
with
medium
carbonation
not
something
i
really
cared
about
or
that
i
would
need
to
revisit
again
d
got
this
a
gift
from
my
boss
after
a
trip
to
poland
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
polish
mocne
and
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
one
out
anytime
soon
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
wit
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
taste
is
of
malts
alcohol
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
fairly
decent
brew
its
ok
i
wouldnt
say
its
good
but
its
not
really
terrible
either
mfd
light
to
meduim
bodied
not
offensive
but
just
not
interesting
or
tasty
enough
to
buy
again
looks
simply
dont
make
for
a
good
beer
maybe
this
was
disrespected
before
i
found
it
but
why
waste
money
to
find
out
even
the
drain
tried
to
reject
this
one
d
hmmm
would
not
go
for
this
one
again
sorry
a
drinkable
brew
not
as
smooth
as
a
plain
lager
but
good
enough
to
come
back
to
par
for
the
course
for
the
style
golden
body
with
an
upward
torrent
of
big
sodalike
bubbles
and
an
active
fizzy
white
head
with
nottoobad
retention
smell
is
noticeably
full
of
alcohol
but
in
a
kinda
nice
tripellike
way
in
fact
there
is
some
delicate
fruitiness
and
a
nice
fresh
grain
aroma
here
that
is
quite
belgian
in
character
apples
and
pears
flesh
out
the
predominantly
sweet
nose
hops
are
basically
undetectable
the
taste
is
rather
sweet
too
and
boozy
there
is
a
little
nuance
but
of
course
the
problem
with
this
style
is
that
it
was
basically
developed
to
try
and
answer
the
demand
for
beer
that
will
get
you
drunk
fast
slake
your
thirst
and
cost
you
next
to
nothing
nuance
doesnt
really
factor
into
it
so
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
off
flavors
are
kept
to
a
minimum
and
while
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
its
not
too
hot
hops
are
too
timid
though
a
bit
more
oomph
from
them
and
they
could
help
balance
out
the
sugars
the
same
goes
for
carbonation
its
too
soft
more
sparkle
would
help
keep
this
refreshing
overall
like
most
strong
lagers
like
this
there
isnt
much
point
to
this
beer
duvel
for
example
is
stronger
more
delicious
more
nuanced
more
refreshing
and
this
is
key
not
very
much
more
expensive
so
why
waste
your
time
drinkability
is
fairly
nice
for
a
strong
beer
the
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
it
go
down
easy
but
there
is
nothing
to
ordinary
or
great
to
the
taste
to
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
would
drink
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
for
a
little
refreshment
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
notes
well
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
even
if
by
accident
because
i
probably
would
have
never
bought
this
on
my
own
its
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
a
malt
liquor
i
havent
had
one
since
high
school
but
i
know
one
thing
its
much
better
than
all
of
the
other
malt
liquors
i
used
to
drink
st
ides
mickeys
olde
e
king
cobra
eat
your
heart
out
baby
its
something
to
drink
to
get
drunk
i
can
do
that
with
this
beer
id
think
id
rather
have
steel
reserve
or
labatt
max
ice
for
that
purpose
and
less
money
spent
those
beers
actually
do
a
good
job
of
minimizing
taste
and
flaws
and
theyre
more
drinkable
than
this
it
has
more
flavor
just
not
anything
worth
tasting
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
have
another
i
seem
to
recall
hevelius
kaper
being
better
go
with
that
instead
d
its
ok
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
will
not
seek
out
d
decently
drinkable
a
bit
heavy
and
strong
though
d
a
pretty
good
strong
lager
certainly
better
than
what
you
get
in
the
cheap
american
malt
liquor
category
for
the
price
its
worth
a
shot
not
really
familiar
with
the
style
yet
this
brew
doesnt
impress
it
says
malt
liquor
right
under
the
mocne
on
the
bottle
so
i
wasnt
expecting
a
refined
brew
the
initial
impression
is
of
a
thin
weak
brew
with
very
little
lace
and
rapidly
retreating
bubbles
the
taste
is
surprisingly
approachable
for
a
malt
liquor
with
a
strong
wheat
maltiness
that
satisfies
a
thirsty
palate
the
deeper
flavor
veers
toward
apply
and
sour
but
the
aftertaste
loses
the
rawer
tones
helping
disguise
the
7
abv
unfortunately
the
whole
experience
is
crippled
by
the
everpresent
aroma
of
raw
alcohol
ultimately
the
bouquet
more
than
anything
batters
what
could
have
been
a
decent
highalcohol
sour
lager
the
taste
is
simple
but
solid
consistent
very
nice
and
full
bodied
with
grain
a
little
bread
crust
fermented
grapes
grapeskin
hints
of
overripe
apple
and
dry
grass
it
has
a
nice
sweetish
aftertaste
of
fruit
and
grain
its
simple
but
full
fairly
zesty
with
a
slightly
thick
frothy
oily
feel
light
smooth
alcoholic
bite
and
warmth
its
very
drinkable

background
with
a
hint
of

that
this
is

the

a

bisciuty
with

bite
at
the
end
goes
down
smooth
and
could
easly
lead
to
a
long
session
edit
at
times
i
got
a
whiff
of
chemically
nastiness
and
alcohol
that
threw
off
the
tasting
its
odd
because
i
actually
genuinely
enjoy
the
taste
and
despise
the
smell
usually
smell
and
taste
go
fairly
hand
in
hand
maybe
if
it
hadnt
made
the
trip
or
was
handled
better
it
wouldnt
be
so
offensive
nasally
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
extremely
malty
with
the
lager
smell
there
the
beer
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
not
much
depth
just
a
slightly
better
malt
taste
than
the
standard
okocim
beer
there
is
a
hint
of
fruits
in
here
as
well
the
feel
is
watery
yet
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
because
there
isnt
much
flavour
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
strong
lager
when
poured
into
a
heavy
seas
euro
style
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
pale
urine
yellow
that
had
a
tiny
head
of
clear
bubbles
these
bubbles
quickly
popped
and
left
only
a
few
bubbles
along
the
edge
there
was
no
sign
of
any
lace
whatsoever
it
had
a
solid
lightly
sour
aroma
of
apple
juice
malted
grains
and
a
dash
of
pepper
at
the
end
i
dont
know
how
you
could
make
apple
juice
sour
they
did
it
the
taste
was
thin
and
weak
with
sweet
malted
grains
more
apple
juice
crispy
herbal
hops
and
then
all
of
these
great
flavors
ended
with
some
malted
wheat
i
know
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
light
but
i
did
enjoy
the
aftertaste
of
crispy
herbal
hops
and
malted
wheat
the
aftertaste
was
better
than
the
initial
taste
i
wouldnt
touch
this
beer
again
all
this
beer
had
going
for
it
was
its
aftertaste
and
low
price
worth
a
try
and
it
certainly
suits
its
style

then
some

a

in

this
has
more

than
you
get
with

i
like
malt
but
this
one
doesnt
really
come
together
very
well
this

theres
a
mild

warms
with
some
mild
harshness
masquerading
as
sharpness
at

its
surprisingly
strong
for
such
a

everything
that
i
expected

that
doesnt

ill
go
out

my
way
to
have
it

smells

tastes
of
cooked
corn
green
apples
and
a
touch

musty
graininess
with
a
little
touch

alcohol
yup
its
a
malt
liquor
all
right
however
it
does
merit
mentioning
that
the
harsh
alcohol
burn
seen
in
a
typical
malt
liquor
is
actually
somewhat
restrained
in
this
brew
its
there
just
not
right
up
in
front
of
everything
like
usual
a
largely
inoffensive
drink
that
goes
down
easily
and
maybe
dangerously
so
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
not
extremely
intriguing
but
not
boring
either
sweet
grainy
grape
and
apple
flavors
dry

low

not
especially
clean

it
does
the
job
dull
bitterness
in

husky
grainy
flavor
dominates
overall
not
the
worst
but
far
from
the
best
this
is
cheap
crunk
juice
dr
high
abv
and
dirt
cheap
by
irish
standards
a
crap
beer
at
a
great
price
for
what
it
is
its
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
night
in
with
the
lads
at
1
49
per
bottle
this
is
a
decent
option
for
getting
drunk
on
a
malt
beverage
on
a
budget
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
here
warrants
the
premium
tag
over
any
other
euro
strong
not
a
bad
deal
at
1
75
for
500ml
trying
too
hard
to
compete
with
other
high
alcohol
beers
efes
extra
falls
terribly
short
in
all
aspects
im
not
sure
what
i
was
thinking
buying
this
and
thankfully
it
counts
as
a
new
style
that
i
have
tried
because
it
had
nothing
else
going
for
it
granted
it
is
strong
and
cheap
but
why
this
one
was
on
sale
in
an
airport
is
beyond
me
and
since
it
was
an
airport
it
wasnt
all
that
cheap
disgusting
from
start
to
finish
with
too
much
sugar
alcohol
and
grain
throughout
and
on
top
of
that
i
was
drinking
it
from
a
plastic
cup
on
an
airport
floor
so
that
didnt
exactly
help
it
any
that
being
said
nothing
was
saving
this
one
surely
it
is
a
beer
to
forget
the

a
very
pretty

on
this
sunny
thanksgiving
afternoon
nose
was
quite
malty
sweet
but
seemingly
free
of
adjuncts
like
corn
xtra
is
not
extra
at
least
not
with
adjuncts
but
with
a
nice
pop
to
its
abv
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
pleasant
enough
lager
sweetness
and
only
about
half
the
heat
that
i
kind
of
expected
to
be
hit
with
finish
was
fairly
dry
again
not
surprising
given
its
relatively
high
abv
simply
suggesting
that
the
fermentable
sugars
were
all
as
the
amish
might
say
i
had
a
can
of
this
which
i
shared
with
my
neighbors
as
part
of
a
beer
tasting
the
color
was
yellow
with
decent
carbonation
the
carbonation
yielded
a
white
head
that
did
not
lace
there
really
wasnt
much
to
smell
outside
of
teh
alcohol
some
thought
they
could
smell
faint
plumb
the
taste
was
just
alcohol
and
grain
to
me
i
did
not
like
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
yuck
and
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
again
however
when
in
turkey
one
should
at
least
try
it
one
bottle
was
enough
too
much
alcohol
and
not
enough
real
flavor
could
have
been
any
of
those
terrible
extra
strong
lagers
dotted
about
europe
all
of
which
should
be
avoided
this
is
the
strongests
beer
that
i
could
find
in
turkey
efes
beers
are
pretty
much
the
only
ones
you
can
get
in
turkey
beer
culture
is
o0bviously
not
a
big
component
in
this
country
but
this
beer
in
particular
makes
miller
light
seem
drinkable
quite
simply
even
for
its
style
profile
its
boring
bland
undercarbonated
and
doesnt
feel
right
im
used
to
hops
and
alcohol
from
the
styles
i
drink
but
this
is
a
nice
maltandalcohol
concoctionmaybe
the
first
euro
strong
lager
ive
ever
had
and
honestly
it
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
the
rest
of
the
efes
line
d
not
too
bad
really
one
of
the
best
efes
offerings
the
taste
is
a
bit
alcoholic
but
not
overly
so
with
only
a
hint
of
roughness
and
with
a
definite
warming
quality
it
tastes
mostly
of
fermented
white
grape
juice
with
white
bread
a
hint
of
fruit
candy
and
a
light
grain
quality
with
a
vague
hint
of
grapfruit
and
orange
juice
it
has
a
slightly
candylike
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
vague
bitterness
and
spicey
bite
to
balance
out
in
the
end
its
mostly
rather
bland
and
a
bit
thin
in
the
feel
from
an
old
bottle
brought
back
from
overseas
sharing
it
with
friends
at
bodega
in
la
crosse
ok
head
and
lace
very
slight
hazy
amber
likewise
mild
nose
the
flavor
is
malty
sweet
without
much
distinction
but
where
the
beer
really
shines
is
in
the
body
luscious
silky
mouthfilling
softy
very
satisfying
maybe
even
too
much
a
bit
warming
from
alcohol
decent
finish
opinion
well
this
beer
has
been
a
bit
better
than
some
of
efes
other
offerings
this
beer
is
a
bit
hollow
for
as
big
as
it
is
i
think
that
the
gravity
was
increased
by
the
use
of
adjuncts
and
in
this
case
a
bit
too
much
if
this
is
all
barley
i
would
be
surprised
i
may
drink
this
beer
again
if
it
is
given
to
me
free
again
as
this
one
wasotherwise
i
will
stick
to
something
more
wellrounded
too
bad
i
picked
this
up
in
brooklyn
i
would
definitely
go
get
more
soon
if
it
was
more
local
drinkability

this
turkish
ghetto
juice
went
down
ok
overall
its
a
very
nicely
done
strong
lager
with
a
beautiful
maltiness
and
hop
character
poured
out
hard
it
forms
a
massive
cream
colored
head
that
is
moderately
longlasting
above
the
dark
gold
body
good
clarity
and
quite
attractive
the
green
body
imparted
a
lightly
skunked
aroma
but
was
very
reminiscent
of
pilsner
urquell
hopping
the
flavor
imparts
an
adjunct
finish
with
some
noticeable
harshness
smooth
body
and
reasonable
drinkability

around

harsh

alcohol
is
evident

the
epiglotisthe
hangy

on

back
of
the
throat
after
the
second
sip
its
not
too
bad
strong

flavour
but
their
is
a
malt
sweetness
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
cheap
scotch
whiskey

almost
granular
mouthfeel

the
throat
refreshed
though
a
hard
pour
generated
a

head
that
was

and
firm
with
plenty
of
contour

still
managed
to
fade

quickly

just

of

the
nose

with
barley
and
corn
competing
for
dominance
this
battle
is
followed
by
a
mild
but
astringent
metallic
hoppy
bite
the
aftertaste
was
more
sweet
than
bitter
though
much
smoother
than
most
of
its
soviet
cousins
certainly
drinkable
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
alcohol
some
sweetness
taste
is
apples
alcohol
malts
a
bit
unusual
and
not
in
a
good
way
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
terrible
but
one
is
more
than
enough
rjt
notes
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
one
im
not
particularly
fond
of
either
cooked
vegetable
is
a
little
too
strong
for
my
liking
as
is
the
alcohol
not
bad
for
the
style
if
you
like
it
i
guess
but
not
one
i
would
get
again
even
if
it
was
on
sale
like
this
time
overall
i
would
not
want
to
sit
down
and
quaff
a
lot
of
this
stuff
that
said
its
not
horrible
or
anything
tastes
like
astringent
alcohol
wet
paper
oddly
toasty
with
some
lingering
malt
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
really
the
alcohol
is
overt
and
theres
little
in
the
way
of
redeeming
characteristics
not
a
beer
id
ever
buy
again
o
better
than
i
expected
but
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
i
wont
buy
this
again
but
it
isnt
awful
appearance
is
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
thick
head
that
dissapates
to
a
fine
film
leaving
a
nice
curtain
lace
smell
of
malt
with
some
earthiness
and
grassy
notes
taste
has
a
light
sweet
malt
corn
husky
that
is
overall
light
in
flavor
but
masks
the
7
8
very
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
considering
the
abv
its
a
clean
easy
going
lager
id
like
to
try
on
tap
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
this
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
while
not
a
session
beer
per
se
i
did
have
two
this
evening
and
found
them
enjoyable
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
to
me
it
seems
like
a
strong
version
of
a
pils
which
is
what
i
think
it
is
really
designed
to
be
isnt
as
quite
refreshing
as
i
would
like
and
i
would
not
buy
it
as
there
is
better
stuff
out
there
that
being
said
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
poland
and
if
i
ever
find
myself
there
i
will
seek
out
some
fresh
lomza
dont
let
that
put
you
off
though
this
is
actually
a
highly
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
while
it
is
quite
malty
and
focuses
its
efforts
on
sweeter
notes
those
notes
are
at
least
moderately
subdued
what
comes
across
is
a
flavorful
beer
that
revels
in
summery
lightness
and
would
be
perfect
fare
for
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
or
the
noonday
deck
of
your
favorite
bar
overall
for
a
euro
strong
lager
this
actually
is
pretty
damn
good
and
it
thankfully
isnt
overly
cloying
the
malt
liquor
moniker
on
the
label
is
simply
a
travesty
overall
its
not
an
offensive
drink
however
i
shouldnt
seek
it
out
anytime
soon
yet
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
one
if
offered
to
me
average
d
one
and
done
too
sweet
and
a
bit
out
of
whack
this
is
very
nice
for
the
style
imo
it
has
a
nice
dry
balance
that
isnt
boozy
while
this
beer
was
not
all
that
impressive
it
fares
nearly
as
well
as
carlsberg
elephant
a
simple
drinker
that
provides
quite
a
delivery
system
for
the
7
8
abv
d
this
is
a
tough
style
to
review
as
there
is
little
conventional
standards
for
it
the
beer
is
well
done
as
far
as
brewing
goes
however
i
find
it
a
bit
sweet
to
drink
another
and
is
perhaps
better
tasted
alongside
a
spicy
or
bitter
food
dish
i
dont
care
for
it
too
much
just
by
itself
a
bit
cloying
overall
nothing
much
of
interest
here
pretty
much
your
standard
high
abv
euro
lager
ill
try
any
beer
i
can
get
my
hands
on
once
but
not
necessarily
twice
this
is
one
of
those
beers
never
again
overall
not
that
strong
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
with
a
fast
falling
white
head
nose
bears
an
almost
slight
citrus
edge
on
top
of
a
grain
character
flavor
is
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
as
that
citruslike
character
starts
to
peek
through
on
the
tail
end
though
a
metallic
and
dirty
aftertaste
lingers
which
kind
of
ruins
it
still
it
is
not
too
shabby
lots
of
carbonation
and
bubble
on
the
tongue
and
not
a
completely
watered
dawn
liquid
feel
drinkable
overall
an
average
type
of
brew
but
not
garbage
golden
straw
in
color
with
a
pale
offwhite
head
no
hops
to
speak
of
on
the
nose
only
a
restrained
malt
character
maybe
a
bit
metallic
initially
this
is
sweet
and
as
strong
as
it
is
i
can
see
why
but
theres
a
reassuring
bitterness
that
kicks
in
after
a
while
mouthfeel
is
full
and
pleasantly
creamy
the
lasting
impression
is
dry
above
par
for
a
style
which
has
many
adherents
if
only
american
strong
macro
lagers
had
this
much
drinkability
this
punchy
lager
tasted
a
bit
sweet
and
cereallike
i
bought
the
wrong
one
not
looking
at
the
designation
beneath
the
brand
name
the
sweet
alcohol
corn
rice
character
put
me
off
a
bit
but
i
was
brave
if
this
was
what
american
malt
liquor
was
all
about
then
we
would
be
alright
it
finished
slightly
sour
with
no
detectable
hop
bitterness
i
wouldnt
do
this
twice
this
brew
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
shallow
fizzy
head
average
appearance
the
aroma
is
a
bit
malty
with
a
distracting
grainy
cereal
quality
that
lingers
way
too
long
cereal
and
vegetable
flavors
are
far
too
prevalent
in
this
one
its
a
little
sweet
and
earthy
with
a
light
body
soft
and
simple
finish
the
abv
is
notable
after
a
few
sips
its
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
but
its
also
on
par
with
other
ubiquitous
strong
eurolagers
boring
brassy
color
and
vague
malty
nose
strong
malt
flavor
with
some
astringents
by
no
means
great
but
drinkable
for
the
style
if
you
want
to
get
messed
up
and
not
drink
oe
or
king
cobra
this
is
a
good
choice
mouthfeel
these
light
flavors
were
very
refrshing
for
something
with
such
an
alcoholic
punch
very
clean
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
only
a
little
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
a
very
pleasant
brew
indeed
if
anyone
can
prove
me
wrong
i
urge
them
to
try
overall
one
of
those
highalcohol
euro
lagers
that
would
see
me
right
if
i
was
sat
in
the
park
on
a
freezing
cold
polish
winters
day
with
my
homeless
friendsbut
on
a
warm
evening
in
long
beach
it
lacks
refinement
and
appeal
not
bad
but
not
good
either
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
certainly
drink
it
again
im
quickly
becoming
a
mocneman
medium
gold
color
lots
of
visible
carbonation
head
is
moderate
pure
white
and
bubbly
smell
is
very
skunked
alcohol
present
and
adjunct
taste
is
not
pleasing
but
better
than
some
euro
lagers
grassy
malt
is
evident
in
the
taste
a
lot
like
many
europ
lagers
but
with
a
lot
more
alcohol
presence
taste
is
actually
pretty
decent
something
i
have
not
come
to
expect
from
this
generally
undrinkable
style
for
a
eastern
euro
strong
lager
it
is
good
a
tasty
brew
that
i
will
order
again
poland
continues
to
surprise
me
with
its
quite
good
beers
oh
yeah
just
because
i
am
a
foreign
language
freak
i
feel
this
is
worth
mentioning
the
name
of
this
stuff
is
pronounced
womzhah
not
lahmzah
in
poland
the
l
with
a
slash
through
it
is
pronounced
like
a
w
and
a

with
either
a
slash
through
it
or
a
dot
over
is
is
pronounced
like
zh
like

silentsabreaug
26
thin
to
medium
in
feel
finish
is
moderately
acidic
but
if
you
decide
to
try
this
bog
standard
in
every
aspect
hope
my
dad
doesnt
get
anymore
itll
only
give
him
headaches
im
getting
tired
of
these
nonmalt
lickah
types
being
labelled
as
such
stupid
laws
and
whatnot
at
least
i
think
thats
the
reason
right
oh
well
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
syrup
white
bread
sweet
honey
light
grass
and
the
vague
sense
of
artificial
berries
the
taste
holds
notes
of
overly
sweet
corn
syrup
booze
hard
water
light
metal
grass
sweet
flowers
and
sweet
caramel
just
a
sweet
boozy
mess
frankly
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
syrupy
feel
overall
nothing
i
really
wanna
ever
have
again
ive
had
worse
but
i
also
have
nothing
truly
positive
to
say
about
it
either
the
smell
was
light
nice
grain
and
yeasty
bread
like
smell
mixed
in
with
some
kinda
light
fruit
maybe
some
banana
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
it
was
pretty
standard
lager
the
taste
was
like
a
really
strong
budweiser
it
tasted
like
your
standard
fare
macro
lager
buch
just
stronger
typical
grain
adn
yeast
maybe
some
corn
in
the
flavor
a
touch
of
alcohol
it
hides
the
higher
abv
well
which
for
me
is
a
bonus
however
it
did
nothing
to
me
to
distinguish
it
from
the
pack
of
euro
lagers
strong
or
otherwise
that
are
available
od
doesnt
taste
bad
like
many
of
the
style
that
said
it
doesnt
taste
good
quite
mild
and
bland
easy
to
dirnk
but
why
would
you
want
to
the
beer
was
in
a
5l
bottle
with
a
date
of
710
despite
this
it
was
good
picked
up
single
bottle
at
a
polish
deli
in
e
windsor
ct
beer
had
a
good
flavor
and
a
nice
after
taste
grain
and
grass
hints
did
not
taste
like
hi
proof
malt
liquor
bet
it
would
rock
drinking
this
on
tap
in
warsaw
would
buy
again
bham
uk
jan
2011
assuming
that
i
am
reviewing
the
correct
beer
its
better
than
your
average
macro
american
lager
and
its
a
good
price
an
ok
beer
definitely
nothing
special
if
you
want
a
decent
strong
reasonably
priced
and
simple
beer
this
is
not
bad
compared
to
the
previous
power
is
clearly
superior
especially
in
terms
of
abv
but
oddly
enough
alcohol
is
less
felt
in
the
nose
which
the
drink
easier
to
drink
we
find
this
rather
ethereal
flavor
in
aftertaste
with
some
rather
dry
herbs
the
nose
is
a
czech
pilsener
mixing
both
the
side
of
grassy
hops
and
side
light
sweet
malt
but
more
powerful
its
drinkable
dont
get
me
wrong
but
theres
two
or
three
epls
from
poland
that
i
would
put
first
before
this
beer
allinall
pretty
much
a
runofthemill
id
like
another
right
now
despite
the
not
too
high
abv
taste
follows
the
smell
a
touch
of
apple
and
mild
hop
spiciness
a
touch
of
floral
quality
intermingling
but
the
alcohols
definitely
in
charge
im
all
set
with
just
this
one
unionmade0
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
definitely
not
a
good
beer
it
does
meet
some
of
the
expectations
for
a
strong
lager
but
lacks
any
balance
and
leaves
the
quaffer
with
punches
that
remind
me
more
of
a
bud
light
platinum
with
a
shot
of
rubbing
alcohol
than
a
strong
euro
lager
to
be
honest
the
price
point
is
attractive
and
can
provide
a
cheap
buzz
but
not
one
to
seek
out
for
bas
imho
o
k
so
my
user
name
pretty
much
says
it
all
i
love
this
beer
ice
cold
in
an
antique
stein
very
similar
to
some
belgian
strong
ales
without
the
hefty
price
i
can
get
a
case
of
20
for
about
30
bucks
malty
and
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
subtle
hop
bitterness
which
suits
me
fine
i
am
no
hop
head
a
big
beer
for
the
buck
and
obviously
one
of
my
faves
worth
seeking
out
great
beer
its
light
adequately
aromatic
flavorful
and
extremely
strong
it
tastes
very
similar
to
russian
beers
specifically
baltica
for
having
such
a
high
alcohol
content
8
7
it
feels
surprisingly
light
i
prefer
it
much
better
than
belgian
beers
which
are
typically
heavy
and
sweet
like
maple
syrup
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
pick
it
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
best
feature
is
that
after
the
carbonation
evaporates
in
about
two
minutes
it
looks
just
like
scotch
whisky
from
the
500
ml
bottle
bought
at
ajs
fine
foods
in
phoenix
o
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
like
a
sweetned
version
of
an
american
malt
liquor
except
the
taste
is
not
that
offensive
the
apple
flavors
definitely
help
to
mask
some
of
the
alcohol
this
beer
is
surprisingly
not
that
difficult
to
drink
considering
its
style
and
strength
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
for
the
style
lots
of
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
and
pretty
easy
om
the
palate
overall
a
euro
dark
lager
with
nothing
to
stand
out
overall
this
beer
is
good
for
a
buzz
but
thats
really
it
not
a
bad
thing
just
dont
treat
it
like
the
best
beer
will
ever
get
because
there
is
room
for
improvement
salud
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
malt
grain
alcohol
and
some
skunky
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
odd
fermented
fruit
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
alcohol
burn
and
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
has
a
pretty
unpleasant
aftertaste
rjt
o
not
bad
bang
for
the
buck
with
8
7
for
under
2
bucks
finally
finishing
my
style
ticks
with
a
beer
i
remember
being
pretty
solid
from
my
earlier
drinkin
days
i
hope
its
still
good
it
pours
a
clear
copper
go
figure
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
shortlived
dirtywhite
foam
the
nose
is
almost
entirely
composed
of
buttery
biscuits
though
some
very
light
grass
and
flowers
vainly
attempt
to
muddle
their
ways
through
to
the
strils
as
well
the
taste
goes
in
a
different
direction
opting
for
a
melange
of
caramel
mandarin
orange
syrup
light
maple
syrup
candi
sugar
and
a
touch
of
mint
in
the
background
gotta
say
this
aint
the
best
taste
in
the
world
the
body
is
the
heaviest
lightmedium
possible
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
syrupy
feel
overall
a
substandard
brew
one
thats
having
me
question
my
earlier
beer
opinions
pours
a
very
clear
deep
gold
color
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
is
pretty
low
some
malt
spice
and
lemon
peel
taste
has
a
rich
caramel
sweetness
and
alcohol
warmth
with
a
lingering
bitter
finish
soft
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
not
an
elegant
beer
but
decent
this
beer
pours
out
as
light
redish
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
herbal
and
kind
of
strange
not
the
most
appealing
smell
here
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
samichlaus
helles
a
little
bit
it
was
almost
too
flavorful
i
think
there
was
just
a
lot
going
on
and
not
enough
of
a
balance
to
figure
out
what
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
heavier
than
most
lagers
overall
i
wouldnt
need
to
have
this
one
again
not
bad
with
food
but
there
are
better
polish
beers
though
rated
to
style
there
are
certainly
worse
damong
the
most
unpalatable
beers
ive
ever
tried
this
one
is
just
not
my
thing
the
floral
and
herbal
notes
are
overwhelming
with
the
combination
of
the
very
present
alcohol
makes
this
one
i
wont
try
again
look
for
the

it
vaguely
resembles
a
strong
belgian
dark
rich
nutty
caramel
and
dried
fruit
character
really
gives
more
of
a
bock
impression
standard
appearance
copper
gold
high
clarity
poor
retention
fades
fast
from
an
initial
fingers
width
of
foam
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
low
amount
of
oxidation
some
papery
dryness
but
it
doesnt
distract
low
carbonation
an
easy
sipper
overall
its
worth
a
try
with
a
fairly
unique
flavor
for
a
polish
lager
d
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
and
flavor
very
well
it
is
a
smooth
drink
with
no
offflavors
and
in
fact
there
are
not
really
many
flavors
at
all
especially
for
such
a
big
beer
this
is
very
thirst
quenching
which
can
be
make
a
quick
end
to
the
night
at

abv
d
not
bad
overall
taste
not
much
better
then
the
smell
it
is
not
that
it
is
bad
it
just
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
there
is
a
slight
nutty
dryness
to
it
but
other
then
that
it
is
pretty
bland
it
is
a
high
octane
brew
but
doesnt
exactly
drink
like
one
it
is
cheap
but
i
prob
wouldnt
buy
it
again
just
cuz
it
was
brewed
in
europe
doesnt
mean
its
any
better
than
colt

my
friend
used
to
buy
this
in
college
and
was
one
of
the
first
craft
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
beers
i
ever
drank
i
still
buy
it
basically
for
that
reason
and
it
brings
me
back
nicely
not
a
bad
beer
overall
sort
of
like
half
a
dopplebock
half
a
light
oktoberfest
would
not
hold
on
to
this
much
longer
consumed
sept
2009
best
by
date
on
bottle
of
july
2007
still
pretty
decent
with
the
age
drinkabilityvery
good
cant
drink
these
all
night
but
definately
can
have
a
couple
no
problem
whoa
thats
a
sweet
flavored
not
good
beer
poured
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
lovely
medium
amber
aroma
is
an
extremely
sweet
smelling
malt
and
a
hint
of
beer
flavor
is
the
same
but
bolder
real
heavy
alcohol
character
could
be
worse
i
suppose
strongly
suspect
a
headache
in
a
bottle
finish
is
sadly
not
short
notes
i
dont
really
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
except
its
unlike
any
other
ive
ever
drank
its
fairly
prickly
from
the
alcohol
but
that
curious
spiciness
is
intriguing
d
even
with
the
8
7
i
was
ok
with
drinking
the
500ml
bottle
the
taste
wasnt
great
but
it
wasnt
bad
enough
to
prohibit
me
from
finishing
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
and
hits
about
half
way
through
the
serving
maybe
this
is
good
for
polish
sessions
but
not
for
mine
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
way
to
get
trashed
this
stuff
is
a
steal
at
1
49
note
be
careful
i
drank
this
one
pretty
fast
just
to
get
it
over
with
im
morally
opposed
to
pouring
beer
down
the
drain
in
a
recession
and
now
im
a
little
bit
buzzed
i
got
this
at
a
small
bar
here
in
black
river
falls
wi
the
place
is
called
rosarioskind
of

this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
consistent
for
style
it
has
a
bit
of
a
czech
lager
taste
to
it
and
the
alcohol
is
essentially
unnoticeable
the
taste
is
clearly
alcholic
but
very
smoothly
so
with
nothing
rough
opr
unpleasant
it
has
a
light
caramel
quality
bread
and
nice
warm
spiciness
its
a
bit
rasiniy
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
light
bitterness
coming
to
the
fore
in
the
finish
it
does
not
taste
quite
as
strong
as
it
is
pours
a
cloudy
amberorange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
with
little
to
no
lacing
spicy
notes
accompanying
crisp
light
fruit
aroma
flavor
is
very
similar
to
aroma
being
spicy
with
hints
of
apple
and
pear
as
well
as
a
slight
alcohol
presence
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
small
slightly
offwhite
head
aroma
has
malt
caramel
and
toffee
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
obvious
alcohol
presence
flavor
is
malt
forward
with
a
slight
bitterness
reminiscent
of
an
oktoberfest
with
lighter
body
and
more
alcohol
all
aspects
are
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
fast
fading
off
white
head
aroma
has
a
malty
sweetness
maybe
some
pear
notes
taste
has
a
boozy
quality
to
it
some
faint
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
and
leaves
a
faint
aftertaste
could
use
some
more
balance
or
depth
in
flavor
to
mask
the
relatively
high
abv
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
would
pass
if
offered
this
again
i
feel
that
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
of
this
and
it
should
probably
be
tried
again
i
dont
think
that
this
is
a
fair
example
of
this
beer
especially
after
reading
other
reviews
overall
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
taste
and
character
however
it
is
still
an
ok
polish
beer
to
drink
with
a
porterhouse
dinner
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
again
unless
someone
actually
wanted
to
try
it
with
me
i
respect
beer
and
always
willing
to
experiment
with
one
wont
do
this
one
again
drinkability
this
one
is
good
as
long
as
you
keep
it
cold
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
ricelike
the
flavor
gets
for
1
99
though
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
i
would
consider
again
another
beer
sold
as
a
singleton
at
my
local
store
i
saw
the
alcolol
content
8
7
and
had
to
give
it
a
try
it
pours
really
nice
with
a
copper
color
and
nice
head
it
smells
and
tastes
a
little
sweet
but
if
it
is
not
really
cold
can
turn
nasty
it
is
very
strong
and
could
make
a
short
night
of
things
if
not
taken
seriously
i
havent
had
too
many
polish
beers
just
the
major
labels
so
this
one
was
a
little
different
it
should
probably
be
brought
out
for
special
occassions
only
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
the
smell
theres
a
big
malty
sweetness
up
front
one
that
lingers
perhaps
a
touch
too
long
but
is
still
feels
like
it
belongs
there
is
a
noble
hop
finish
along
with
an
alcoholic
kick
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
a
bit
syrupy
but
overall
its
not
bad
this
one
does
pack
a
punch
and
is
quite
sweet
so
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
sessioner
but
its
a
very
solid
polish
beer
that
i
would
have
again
three
hundredplus
years
of
brewing
experience
eh
lets
see
crisp
and
dry
aroma
from
a
generous
head

22oz

glass
a
burnt
sienna
body
with
effervescence
a
pictureperfect
lager
to
the
light
hints
of

early
are
not
a
good
sign
yet
mellow
balanced
and
drinkable
throughout
the
sampling
fullbodied
malt
flirts
with
a
metallic
tinge
european
strong
lager
was
not
in
my
lexicon
before
tonight
but
i
can
appreciate
the
work
on
this
not
so
recommendable
as
it
is
a
firsttime
thrill
dthis
is
kind
of
gross
i
am
not
a
fan
to
say
the
least
at
least
it
looks
good
overall
another
pleasant
surprise
from
poland
ive
been
seeing
a
lot
of
good
polish
brews
at
the
local
specialty
liquor
stores
lately
pleasantly
malty
with
a
solid
8
7
kick
this
one
is
also
priced
reasonably
enough
to
stock
up
on
a
few
grab
one
or
a
few
and
check
it
out
a
decent
sipping

expected

i
expected

a
tasty
beer
from
poland
a
country
that
regularly
produces
beers
that
are
better
than
i
would

this

both
pretty

in

there
is

kind
of

wise
this
beer
looks
beautiful

it

just

plays

here
but
adds

more
than

there
are
better

worse
highalcohol
beers
from
eastern

i
would
take
this
over
typical
american
malt
liquors
not
bad
for
what
it
is
it
does
have
some
character
to
it
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
with
some
tangerine
highlights
the
head
was
a
finger
of
slightly
yellow
foam
that
retained
well
at
first
as
a
cap
and
then
as
a
collar
the
aroma
was
of
booze
additionally
there
was
some
skunky
notes
and
generic
malt
along
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
more
pleasant
than
the
aroma
suggested
but
it
still
was
dominated
by
booze
in
tandem
with
the
generic
malt
and
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
lurking
behind
it
all
totally
euromalt
liquor
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
delicate
as
a
beer
it
reminded
me
of
my
college
girlfriend
in
colorado
it
felt
good
and
looked
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
stuck
with
it
gotta
love
the
random
ukrainian
ticks
amiright
this
one
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
slightly
sour
wheat
light
grass
light
sweet
flowers
and
a
few
drops
of
lemon
juice
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cloyingly
sweet
corn
syrup
straight
chlorophyll
powdered
sugar
and
light
wheat
wow
this
stuff
almost
comes
across
as
an
american
malt
lickah
one
of
the
crappier
ones
in
terms
of
flavor
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
watery
feel
overall
i
could
not
stand
much
of
this
beer
at
all
it
seriously
hurt
me
a
little
bit
to
drink
boo
this
this
one
was
not
horrible
but
i
wont
remember
the
name
of
this
beer
in
two
weeks
just
soso
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
crisp
slightly
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
nice
mouthfeel
and
abundant
malt
flavor
in
this
beer
sadly
i
will
say
i
was
expecting
much
worse
not
great
but
not
horrible
like
some
american
malt
liquor
that
makes
me
want
to
retch
as
if
you
couldnt
already
infer

alcohol
content

abv
seems
to
define
most
aspects
of
the
finished
product
its
more
malty
so
i
think
it
lacks
balance
but
i
suppose
you
should
expect
that
for
such
a
cheap
beer
there
is
hardly
any
english
on
the
label
and
it
cost
me
about
1
50
for
0
5
l
i
think
some
other
reviewers
have
commented
on
this
below
me
but
i
suppose
you
could
think
of
it
as
a
glorified
40
for
the
price
its
alright
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
beer
again
unless
im
looking
to
get
really
really
drunk
as
an
import
it
is
very
cheap
but
it
is
better
than
average
a
good
value
id
buy
it
again
d
ive
always
liked
this
beer
having
spent
an
extended
time
in
ukraine
i
believe
this
beer
is
one
of
their
best
offerings
to
the
rest
of
the
free
world
too
bad
i
cant
buy
it
for
0
45
like
there
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
yet
unremarkable
ukranian
brew
this
brewery
seems
to
have
a
couple
solid
lagers
in
their
stable
others
from
this
region
havent
been
so
good
recommended
if
you
are
into
german
polish
beer
ok
i
might
be
in
the
minority
here
but
i
actually
like
this
stuff
might
be
because
i
like
russian
brown
bread
a
lot
and
this
tastes
exactly
like
that
to
me
the
one
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
drink
it
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
similar
to
molson
xxx
but
better
made
smoother
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
along
with
the
tonguenumbing
alcohol
ho
hum
sinkability

this
could
give
a
horse
gingivitis

skip
it
the
mouth
is
nothing
special
i
could
order
another
maybe
two
before
moving
on
this
lager
poured
a
hazy
goldenlight
amber
color
with
tall
creamy
slightly
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
settled
the
smell
was
slightly
sweetish
malty
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
and
hops
there
was
also
a
bit
of
a
cornlike
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
like
corn
syrup
with
some
malt
it
was
decently
hoppy
especially
in
the
finish
there
was
the
lightest
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
smooth
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
sticky
adjunct
sweetness
lingered
this
beer
was
not
horrible
but
it
was
not
very
good
and
i
would
rather
not
drink
another

that
counters
the
persisting

all
the
way
to
the
considerable
aftertaste
not
that
bad
but
strange
alcohol
is
noticeable
a
decent
beginning
and
an
odd
finish
for
a
mass
produced
beer
this
one
isnt
too
bad
its
very
smooth
and
the
flavor
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
adjuct
flavors
of
other
similar
beers
smooth
and
rich
though
i
almost
wish
it
wasnt
carbonation
is
light
and
easy
overall
feel
is
lightly
caustic
ill
pass
on
this
one
if
i
ever
see
it
again
the
things
i
do
for
my
country
a
mild
lemon
and
lime
citrusy
flavor
and
light
herbal
background
taste
make
way
for
the
dominant
alcohol
kick
a
waxy
cardboard
like
quality
is
noticed
later
in
the
glass
this
is
an
oddball
brew
pale
gold
with
an
average
level
of
carbonation
head
is
big
at
first
but
vanishes
quickly
smell
is
musty
and
alcoholic
no
hop
aroma
detectable
wet
paint
is
not
too
far
out
malty
sweetish
taste
quite
onedimensional
a
cloying
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
end
for
the
aftertaste
but
not
before
coarse
grainy
notes
prevail
not
an
impressive
beer
the
underlying
sweetness
at
first
sip
is
its
best
feature
avoid
the
liquid
is
a
clear
deep
gold
a
hard
pour
induced
a
two
fingered
white
head
wiht
some
body
and
a
bit
of
staying
power
leaving
a
few
traces
of
lace
along
the
glass
the
nose
is
harsh
and
metallic
a
sign
of
things
to
come
the
mouth
is
heavy
and
quite
prickly
the
flavor
is
basically
sweet
corn
syrup
followed
by
a
harsh
metallic
bitterness
that
is
most
unpleasant
alcohol
states
its
presence
quite
insistently
and
there
is
little
to
cloak
and
tame
the
beast
youd
probably
be
better
off
just
drinking
diluted
grain
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
a
pretty
darn
unpleasant
mix
of
sweet
corn
and
harsh
tinny
metal
swill
did
someone
say
swill
of
the
one
liter
in
my
bottle
45
ended
up
down
the
drain
the
beer
pours
the
prototypical
pilsner
clear
gold
color
with
a
mountainous
head
that
is
bright
white
in
color
frothy
in
its
texture
and
the
lace
a
white
satin
veil
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
the
archetypal
pilsner
fresh
crisp
and
malt
sweet
as
is
the
start
with
a
fair
to
middling
top
finish
is
peaceful
in
its
acidity
and
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
sweet
and
dry
aftertaste
just
a
common
pilsner
with
a
7

percent
abv
blech
pours
a
hazy
golden
body
with
a
short
but
creamy
brightwhite
head
that
drops
to
a
decent
collar
but
leaves
no
lace
the
nose
expresses
a
mild
grainy
malt
and
some
noticeable
alcohol
a
firm
medium
body
is
leveled
by
its
crisp
carbonation
the
flavor
displays
a
dryish
grainy
malt
with
some
clear
alcohol
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
it
finishes
short
and
dry
with
just
a
drop
of
lightly
sweet
grainy
malt
although
adjuncts
are
clearly
being
used
there
is
a
fuller
graininess
than
offered
by
some
other
examples
but
theres
also
a
stronger
alcohol
as
well
overall
an
average
eastern
european
strong
lager
pale
golden
straw
belies
the
weight
of
the
flavor
tons
of
fruity
esters
in
the
aroma
very
german
weizen
flavor
is
chock
full
of
fruity
bubblegum
and
juicyfruit
gum
flavors
what
there
is
of
english
on
the
label
indicates
this
is
an
ale
beer
not
much
insight
into
the
style
i
dont
think
ive
run
across
something
so
full
of
fruity
esters
that
wasnt
some
sort
of
weizen
or
belgian
variation
defies
easy
classification
alcohol
is
a
fairly
noteworthy
flavoring
component
but
not
too
distracting
an
interesting
beer
notes
hmm
can
you
say
imported
malt
liquor
not
bad
hooch
at
all
big
alcohol
kick
with
a
decent
drinkability
sorry
does
not
come
in
40
oz
bottles
they
probably
were
not
thinking
about
boys
in
the
hood
drinking
their
four
os
but
this
stuff
is
pretty
damn
close
to
it
just
like
its
name
feels
heavy
but
still
is
attractive
i
would
compare
it
on
par
with
guinness
not
standing
out
that
much
but
not
bad
slightly
better
described
with
the
word
a
bit
better
than
just
fine
this
beer
tastes
nothing
like
carlsburg
not
really
my
thing
but
not
that
bad
either
you
could
do
worse
a
cloudy
o
this
was
actually
much
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
the
finish
was
a
little
harsh
but
not
as
bad
as
its
rating
overall
weak
flavor
and
smell
with
short
thin
mouth
feel
price
wasnt
bad
overall
this
is
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
but
it
was
not
at
all
as
bad
as
i
feared
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
here
overall
this
brew
actually
delivered
much
more
then
i
was
expecting
form
the
look
or
smell
it
was
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
overall
while
not
something
all
that
exceptional
it
was
both
rather
refreshing
and
flavorful
not
a
bad
one
to
at
least
try
o
luckily
got
a
few
nonskunked
bottles
and
i
think
that
made
it
quite
a
bit
more
enjoyable
not
complex
by
any
means
but
as
a
higher
abv
brew
thats
meant
to
taste
like
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
its
not
bad
at
all
i
like
to
think
of
this
style
as
the
euro
style
of
american
malt
liquor
with
that
outlook
this
is
actually
a
halfdecent
brew
i
wouldnt
risk
multiple
purchases
just
because
of
the
green
bottle
and
high
risk
of
skunkiness
but
i
have
no
shame
in
rating
this
with
a
score
that
is
quite
a
bit
higher
than
average
overall
a
3
for
elephant
beer
carlsberg
danmark
as
i
wont
buy
this
brew
again
elephant
beer
brewed
by
carlsberg
denmark
as
with
an
abv
of
7
2
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
brew
has
a
the
look
of
an
american
lager
keep
in
mind
this
brew
was
pours
out
of
a
green
bottle
the
smell
is
skunky
with
some
grains
and
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
with
some
skunkiness
for
having
an
abv
of
7
2
it
is
really
smooth
im
not
big
on
the
taste
of
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
it
has
some
skunkyness
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
of
5
not
the
best
but
far
from
the
worst
i
may
by
this
brew
again
i
may
buy
this
brew
again
i
would
like
to
try
this
brew
in
a
can
surprisingly
nice
and
smooth
very
euro
lager
sweet
malt
just
a
touch
of
hops
really
hides
the
higher
abv
pretty
thin
but
cool
and
refreshing
overall
not
a
bad
euro
lager
really
makes
me
think
that
this
is
a
higher
abv
version
of
heineken
a
nice
head
and
crisp
mouthfeel
this
strong
eurolager
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
the
aroma
is
distinctive
with
a
toasted
biscuit
hint
the
taste
hides
the
alcohol
well
finishing
clean
not
the
best
beer
but
not
as
poor
as
many
of
the
reviews
suggest
i
really
enjoyed
the
slightly
sweet
crisp
and
moderately
dry
aftertaste
taste
on
the
front
end
it
was
okay
nothing
to
write
home
about
ive
had
only
a
few
kolsch
beers
but
this
wasnt
my
favorite
it
reminded
me
of
a
blended
white
wine
in
one
hand
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
on
the
other
you
really
cant
do
much
or
get
much
out
of
it
its
obviously
supposed
to
be
paired
with
lighter
foods
but
theres
still
nothing
that
id
pair
it
with
a
couple
by
the
pool
wouldnt
be
bad
though
the
graininess
makes
the
otherwise
crisp
and
notquitesmooth
feel
a
little
harsher
while
alcohol
thins
the
back
end
this
one
seems
to
be
fresh
and
it
tastes
much
better
than
average
malt
liquors
though
a
style
that
is
far
from
my
favorite
it
did
not
get
repulsive
after
warming
up
norm
for
the
style
and
most
adjunct
lagers
just
as
a
reference
i
actually
liked
this
imperial
pilsner
i
could
have
a
few
its
imbalanced
and
not
good
there
are
much
cheaper
malt
liquors
that
will
do
the
same
edit
seems
like
only
some
of
mine
were
skunked
i
took
another
one
out
of
the
fridge
tonight
and
found
it
pleasantly
unskunky
when
it
hasnt
been
ravaged
by
the
light
its
not
half
bad
its
still
pretty
generictasting
and
nothing
to
clamor
for
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
ill
up
the
taste
and
overall
rating
by
a
little
bit
better
than
their
pilsner
but
i
still
not
impressed
with
these
guys
overall
it
was
rather
disappointing
but
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
overall
special
about
it
this
is
my
first
review
on
this
siteso
please
excuse
my
less
then
stellar
review
stylebut
i
have
been
a
huge
beer
enthusiast
for
over
30
years
so
i
am
no
noob
when
it
comes
to
the
frothy
goodness
of
the
wonderful
world
of
beer
alesi
know
this
does
not
qualify
me
as
any
type
of
expert
in
the
leastbut
i
do
know
what
i
like
with
that
saidi
honestly
can
not
understand
why
carlsburg
elephant
seems
to
be
slagged
and
hated
on
so
muchby
so
many
i
mean
this
is
a
damn
good
beerimho
its
crispnice
and
hoppy
not
too
bittera
perfect
brew
for
these
hot
humid
days
of
summervery
refreshingwith
a
nice
finishperhaps
it
does
have
a
slight
alcohol
taste
that
lingers
a
bit
too
long
a
head
that
is
nothing
to
brag
aboutbut
overall
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
nice
refreshing
brew
and
quite
drinkablenot
the
horrid
stale
skunky
swill
so
many
reviewers
make
it
out
to
be
here
in
these
forumsbut
thats
the
thing
with
beerwhat
i
enjoy
and
find
to
be
a
decent
brewthe
next
guy
may
very
well
hateanyway
my
point
is
do
not
dismiss
this
brew
if
you
have
not
tried
itbecause
imho
its
well
worth
checking
out
for
yourselfcheers
o
imagine
corona
with
7
2
alcohol
its
not
terrible
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
i
like
bigger
lagers
and
this
one
is
better
than
most
nice
summer
lager
and
probably
a
good
winter
one
too
in
either
season
dangerous
as
it
drinks
close
to
a
lighter
lager
aftertaste
there
isnt
much
of
an
aftertaste
here
it
does
end
sweet
and
becomes
drying
as
i
continue
to
swallow
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
the
sweet
finish
i
just
wish
it
would
hang
on
for
a
bit
longer
for
1
99
a
bottle
it
is
worth
every
penny
for
the
sweet
finish
and
the
high
abv
this
is
the
first
and
only
beer
from
carlsberg
on
the
list
too
i
am
not
even
sure
what
else
they
do
maybe
i
will
look
the
next
time
i
am
at
total
wine
cheers
the
sweetness
and
sticky
texture
make
this
a
nogo
i
will
say
im
disappointed
with
my
purchase
could
have
just
got
some
other
swill
at
a
cheaper
price
and
would
have
never
known
the
difference
i
will
say
that
the
7
2
is
not
a
lie
after
one
i
could
definitely
feel
it
would
not
buy
again
though
overall
this
is
just
not
my
style
i
havnt
tried
many
euro
brews
of
this
style
but
if
this
is
any
indication
then
i
think
i
will
just
stick
to
something
else
anything
else
got
it
as
a
part
of
a
mix
6
so
i
didnt
waste
money
on
a
whole
6
pack
maybe
try
this
if
you
like
skunky
funkiness
up
to
you
drinkable
picture
needs
to
be
updated
there
is
a
new
green
bottle
with
silver
green
and
gold
label
a
little
cloudy
but
nice
golden
yellow
color
the
malt
taste
is
clean
and
smooth
with
faint
hops
the
best
part
is
that
the
alcohol
sneaks
in
and
does
the
job
well
seems
like
this
beer
is
underrated
here
but
honestly
its
a
good
malt
beer
imho
having
drank
4
of
these
just
now
im
having
trouble
focusing
on
this
review
so
what
does
that
tell
you
overall
if
i
had
been
given
this
without
knowing
what
it
was
i
would
have
thought
this
to
be
some
corporate
american
product
it
has
some
audience
and
may
even
be
a
staple
for
some
but
for
my
taste
it
pushes
the
definition
of
beer
too
far
in
a
single
dimension
final
thoughts
green
bottles
are
never
the
way
to
go
and
this
proves
it
would
i
drink
it
again
highly
unlikely
overall
a
nice
and
sneaky
beer
will
get
you
there
before
you
know
it
mouthfeel
is
the
beers
strong
point
i
genuinely
enjoyed
this
beer
based
on
this
criteria
alone
crisp
hugely
bubbled
and
itllgetyoudrunk
or
better
yet
a
good
beer
for
when
youre
already
drunk
and
not
concerned
about
flavor
and
for
some
reason
want
to
get
more
drunk
and
want
to
look
classy
by
drinking
a
sexy
looking
import
bottle
with
a
large
african
mammal
on
it
so
when
youre
in
that
sort
of
mood
drink
the
piss
outta
this
one
o
this
is
a
bad
beer
im
sure
its
trip
over
seas
doesnt
help
but
this
beer
tastes
offensive
it
makes
me
make
the
face
after
every
sip
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
one
o
typical
euro
lager
skunky
and
not
a
whole
lot
more
o
another
euro
lager
not
bad
but
only
if
nothing
else
is
available
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
we
were
not
expecting
much
after
that
nose
but
we
found
a
shocking
depth
to
the
malt
bill
there
was
butter
and
diacetyls
light
esters
and
nice
sweetness
the
backing
was
still
full
of
adjuncts
which
ultimately
took
away
from
it
but
this
is
not
a
bad
experience
on
the
whole
overall
impression
i
remember
having
this
one
growlers
pub
in
st
louis
but
wasnt
such
a
beer
advocate
at
the
time
so
probably
chugged
it
this
one
has
a
very
strong
profile
while
being
very
drinkable
enjoyed
but
wouldnt
be
my
typical
style
i
would
go
to
o
im
really
not
into
this
beer
the
best
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
its
mouthfeel
and
that
really
isnt
much
i
really
dont
think
id
have
this
again
period
and
am
glad
i
have
no
more
of
these
i
tried
to
be
as
fair
as
i
could
by
waiting
until
i
had
the
last
one
to
offer
a
review
and
literally
as
each
beer
i
consumed
it
gradually
got
worse
i
think
this
is
not
a
good
beer
another
standard
euro
lager
in
this
case
a
strong
euro
lager
in
my
experience
that
just
means
a
little
harsher
and
a
little
worse
this
one
is
no
different
pours
golden
with
a
slight
head
and
constant
stream
of
bubbles
smells
harsh
alcoholic
and
grainy
with
a
harsh
bitterness
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
then
grainy
then
hot
and
harsh
with
a
bit
of
sour
graininess
in
the
end
not
pleasant
made
me
grimace
if
anything
the
mouthfeel
is
even
worse
harsh
and
solvent
like
bleh
overall
a
reasonable
lager
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
high
abv
when
i
was
drinking
it
a
good
sessional
but
a
bit
steep
at
au63
a
case
2012
for
just
a
lager
thanks
to
australian
pricing
regulations
this
very
maltliquorish
brew
is
pretty
nasty
it
has
a
nasty
bitternes
mixed
with
the
malty
taste
that
is
a
bit
hard
to
drink
if
given
a
choice
of
chewing
my
arm
off
or
drinking
a
six
of
these
id
drink
these
i
would
call
it
an
above
average
lager
although
not
too
far
away
from
average

with
fast
acting
white
foam
some
remains
depper
smell
malt
amongst
the
adjunct
if
that
makes
any
sense
taste
is
a
richer
fuller
lager
firm
pils
hop
with
a
citrus
tang
close
quick
finish
some
bitter
remains
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
at
least
try
personally
i
am
enjoying
straight
from
bottle
on
my
5th
out
of
6
the
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
takes
away
from
the
taste
but
its
still
smooth
for
a
7
2
it
may
be
a
bit
pricy
for
your
particular
vendor
10
for
a
sixer
at
gator
beverage
in
gainesville
fl
overall
not
bad
for
a
strong
ale
easier
to
drink
than
an
heineken
in
my
opinion
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
soilid
beer
smooth
drinking
with
a
little
kick
a
great
summer
spring
brew
so
hot
like
imperial
heneiken
but
without
the
good
skunkiness
o
pretty
terrible
will
never
have
this
beer
again
upset
my
stomach
carlsberg
elephant
is
a
very
clear
very
sparkling
light
golden
beer
it
has
a
thin
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
it
has
an
aroma
of
light
grain
malt
extract
and
skunk
its
medium
bodied
pretty
smooth
and
pretty
sparkling
with
a
reasonably
clean
finish
its
quite
sweet
it
tastes
like
malt
extract
and
fusel
oil
with
an
aftertaste
of
burnt
rubber
this
is
pretty
unpleasant
is
this
malt
liquor
this
is
a
beer
i
would
not
have
again
i
would
accept
it
if
it
was
on
draft
to
see
if
there
would
be
a
difference
decent
smell
i
like
stronger
beers
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
but
after
i
tasted
it
i
was
disappointed
this
was
not
good
at
all
bad
after
taste
too
i
was
tasted
much
smoother
beers
at
much
higher
alcohol
concentration
so
overall
i
see
no
reason
to
buy
this
beer
boozy
beer
in
the
smell
taste
feel
and
after
effects
o
not
nearly
the
crisp
and
light
beer
that
its
brother
is
o
a
better
than
average
lager
o
it
exceeded
expectations
its
an
above
average
pale
lager
but
its
not
a
particularly
great
beer
poured
a
2
white
head
clear
straw
yellow
color
smells
moderately
skunked
and
id
suppose
the
green
glass
bottle
despite
looking
cool
contributed
to
that
everything
about
this
beer
up
to
this
point
struck
me
as
bmc
but
then
with
the
taste
it
surprised
me
it
is
very
sweet
creamy
has
malt
an
herbal
aspect
and
a
mild
hop
finish
this
is
more
than
your
typical
bmc
food
match
its
almost
sweet
enough
to
be
a
dessert
beer
and
im
inclined
to
suggest
a
flan
of
some
description
perhaps
strawberry
jokes
on
me
i
just
did
overall
drinkability
pretty
decent
well
balanced
no
off
characters
smooth
easy
feel
is
a
bit
below
medium
with
crisp
carb
felt
on
the
tounge
which
stings
after
a
few
sips
with
that
the
alcohol
stings
and
puts
tears
to
my
eyes
glad
i
got
another
go
at
this
one
but
maybe
it
is
time
for
me
to
retire
it
forever
d
low
drinkability
as
i
am
having
it
i
think
it
might
be
better
chilled
i
know
this
is
not
a
perfect
beer
i
and
many
other
eurofans
on
here
enjoy
this
beer
it
seems
for
similar
reasons
it
reminds
of
us
a
time
when
beer
was
something
new
and
was
directly
tied
to
locality
to
me
this
beer
is
terrific
in
its
unpretentious
attitude
and
overall
european
confidence
overall
this
is
drinkable
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
did
appreciate
the
bottle
green
glass
with
raised
carlsberg
not
as
currently
pictured
overall
4
0
very
good
beer
and
worth
tracking
down
this
is
almost
like
a
dubbel
german
lager
in
that
it
tastes
like
the
a
condensed
version
of
the
best
german
lager
youve
ever
had
all
those
flavors
are
here
and
intensified
if
you
like
the
german
lager
style
you
will
really
love
this
beer
be
sure
you
remember
that
this
is
a
7
2
abv
a
little
surprised
at
the
low
scores
on
this
one
but
to
each
his
own
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
heavily
of
skunk
green
bottle
and
some
very
light
grain
aromas
pretty
gross
taste
is
of
sweetened
grains
and
some
minor
metallic
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
with
a
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
taste
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
for
any
style
the
skunk
smell
is
very
hard
to
get
over
every
time
you
bring
the
glass
to
your
lips
for
a
sip
blah
this
review
brings
me
closer
to
one
of
my
reviewing
goals
3
beers
per
style
all
104
on
beeradvocate
i
am
now
only
missing
one
gose
review
and
one
bière
de
champagne
soon
d
thin
light
and
refreshing
though
to
a
point
since
there
really
is
not
much
to
this
o
this
beer
doesnt
get
any
love
on
here
in
all
honesty
this
is
one
of
my
goto
imported
beers
it
could
scale
back
just
a
hint
on
the
lemon
and
orange
peel
but
other
than
that
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
dr
very
easily
drinkable
low
quality
and
high
abv
a
great
chugging
beer
for
a
night
in
with
the
lads
if
yere
seeking
to
get
bollocksed
but
not
worthy
of
a
proper
serving
if
youre
wanting
a
good
beer
pretty
cheap
at
least
by
german
standards
especially
for
an
import
overall
this
another
bottle
i
bought
just
cuz
i
needed
the
bottlecap
i
use
to
buy
this
sometimes
about
ten
years
ago
when
i
was
21
and
broke
because
of
the
7
2
abv
id
only
recommend
this
to
someone
who
happens
to
like
heinekin
because
of
the
abv
i
got
purchased
this
beer
as
part
of
a
mix
and
match
six
pack
that
i
got
at
a
wegmans
grocery
store
i
thought
that
it
was
a
pretty
decent
european
lager
however
it
is
a
tad
overpriced
if
youre
buying
it
here
in
the
states
it
reminded
me
of
a
heineken
only
with
much
more
kick
since
it
is
7
20
abv
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
the
nose
offers
grain
a
bit
outdated
with
a
fine
touch
of
alcohol
such
as
through
any
fruit
liqueur
the
taste
is
alcohol
syrupy
a
bit
too
much
and
offers
an
array
of
ripe
fruit
on
the
edge
of
decay
in
addition
it
is
unfortunately
not
easy
to
drink
many
blabla
finally
a
beer
that
is
closely
related
to
ordinary
strong
lager
without
any
personality
and
originality
purchased
a
bomber
of
it
as
this
was
the
best
option
yikes
the
beer
poured
a
dirtly
straw
colour
with
a
instantly
vaporized
head
it
smelled
of
corn
syrup
pale
malts
and
biscuit
all
along
a
cheap
alcoholic
line
the
taste
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
mass
produced
lager
fake
maltiness
from
syrup
zero
hop
presence
and
a
lingering
skunkiness
that
simply
prolonged
the
misery
the
regular
carlsberg
is
so
much
more
drinkable
its
inevitable
that
any
strong
variant
of
a
lager
will
end
up
tasting
all
messed
up
like
this
i
could
finish
only
less
than
half
of
the
bottle
not
recommended
probably
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
after
turning
21
and
havent
had
it
since
i
was
told
that
this
beer
was
good
from
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
took
his
word
on
it
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
and
found
this
to
be
rather
gross
i
asked
him
what
he
liked
about
it
and
he
just
said
that
he
liked
it
because
it
was
strong
on
the
strong
side
is
correct
especially
for
someone
whos
just
getting
into
beers
this
brew
was
yellow
in
color
it
looked
like
a
becks
smelled
and
tasted
like
one
too
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
7
abv
other
than
that
you
can
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
d
normally
i
wouldnt
really
review
a
beer
that
i
didnt
care
for
but
this
was
so
bad
drain
pour
that
i
had
to
give
it
my
lowest
score
because
it
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
imo
the
green
bottle
and
twist
off
cap
should
have
warned
me
i
understand
that
some
may
like
it
but
i
found
nothing
good
with
this
beer
sorry
carlsberg
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
a
low
quality
beer
which
i
will
not
try
again
avoid
the
cpj
it
got
a
c
from
me
most
green
bottles
get
an
f
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
to
say
the
least
why
by
malt
liquor
if
this
is
available
well
if
price
is
not
an
issue
a
little
too
expensive
for
the
quality
received
rjt
an
average
appearance
a
golden
orange
hue
with
a
bubbly
white
head
had
a
grassy
grainy
aroma
with
some
whiffs
of
alcohol
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
alcoholic
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
average
drinkability
had
a
sweet
alcohol
taste
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
all
in
all
just
an
average
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
an
one
finger
head
which
recedes
to
skim
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
present
the
smell
is
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
alcohol
the
hop
smell
is
generic
though
the
taste
is
a
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
generic
hop
bite
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
slightly
dry
drinkability
is
okay
its
an
easy
drink
nothing
to
really
make
you
dislike
it
it
is
very
generic
and
bland
but
you
could
take
a
couple
an
overall
okay
beer
d
a
little
to
bitter
for
consistent
consumption
not
bad
but
borderline
skunky
hoppiness
keeps
me
on
the
fence
with
this
one
certainly
an
interesting
beer
that
may
take
some
time
getting
used
to
the
7
2
alcohol
kicked
in
even
with
just
one
bottle
so
i
dont
think
id
have
too
many
of
these
back
to
back
slightly
off
white
head
of
one
finger
splotchy
lace
with
little
cling
matches
a
8
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
aromas
of
wheat
straw
barley
and
a
little
citrus
taste
has
flavors
of
wheat
barley
starts
heavy
sweet
in
the
middle
tart
at
the
end
some
body
in
the
mouthfeel
sort
of
creamy
but
just
a
little
thin
beer
has
some
kick
good
for
a
party
with
limited
time
to
get
a
buzz
drinkable
and
amped
up
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
notes
not
my
favorite
euro
strong
lager
but
a
respectable
beer
when
choices
are
limited
i
thought
this
was
a
canadian
beer
maybe
ive
got
this
wrong
all
i
remember
is
that
it
had
an
elephant
on
the
label
and
was
11abv
and
again
thats
all
i
remember
other
than
that
just
a
typical
pale
lager
with
extra
alcohol
for
getting
cheapos
drunk
faster
i
got
the
real
stuff
brewed
in
denmark
not
the
canadian
version
nothing
special
in
the
appearance
category
pale
goldyellow
little
to
no
head
and
scant
lacing
but
scandinavian
beers
pretty
much
follow
this
appearance
in
general
smells
not
bad
some
doughy
orange
rind
and
faint
lemon
the
flavor
is
good
very
smooth
carbonation
and
great
mouthfeel
a
little
spicy
vanilla
cream
or
orange
cream
flavors
more
malty
than
hoppy
sweetness
comes
through
nicely
similar
to
some
belgian
ales
ive
tried
the
booze
quotient
is
high
but
i
hardly
notice
it
in
fact
its
pretty
refreshing
and
i
can
happily
down
a
few
of
these
without
getting
tired
of
the
flavor
the
downside
to
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
an
astringent
bite
but
the
overall
positive
taste
wins
me
over
i
buy
this
on
occasion
and
im
never
let
down
compared
to
canadian
strong
beers
or
malt
liquors
ive
tried
this
is
exceptionally
good
drinkability
this
beers
flaws
combined
with
its
high
abv
make
for
not
much
drinkability
still
i
suppose
you
could
do
a
helluva
lot
worse
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissapears
quickly
with
little
lacing
out
of
the
bottle
clean
aroma
with
you
can
smell
some
alcohol
and
grains
starts
a
little
bitter
and
grainy
tasting
then
turns
to
some
sweetness
and
noticeable
alcohol
kick
i
felt
this
beer
is
kind
of
thin
and
watery
not
very
good
nice
to
taste
once
the
grain
alcohol
taste
of
it
makes
it
disappointing
especially
considering
i
rather
like
the
creamy
soft
carbonation
otherwise
d
the
smell
and
taste
are
acceptable
and
it
looks
good
for
what
it
is
but
the
mouthfeel
really
lets
this
one
down
it
isnt
crisp
and
refreshing
like
one
would
expect
its
unlikely
that
ill
pick
this
up
again
d
if
im
trying
to
tie
one
on
quick
i
could
see
this
coming
in
handy
couldnt
drink
more
than
maybe
two
in
one
sitting
as
i
could
anticipate
tasting
more
paint
thinner
than
lager
as
i
go
on
but
honestly
its
okay
for
what
it
is
this
falls
away
significantly
as
a
drinkable
beer
leaving
it
too
harsh
and
too
unpleasant
for
all
its
aggressive
characteristics
it
doesnt
have
the
quality
in
the
base
beer
to
support
it
it
ends
up
feeling
overblown
and
harsh
cheers
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
couple
fingers
of
white
head
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
golden
color
thats
where
my
compliments
end
it
has
a
bready
malt
aroma
and
of
course
the
initial
skunk
smell
because
it
was
in
a
green
bottle
i
get
a
strong
bitter
metallic
taste
i
had
this
beer
probably
ten
years
ago
and
couldnt
remember
how
it
was
now
i
realized
that
i
had
repressed
the
memory
of
the
ordeal
im
not
really
impressed
i
cannot
imagine
including
this
on
any
rotation
of
beers
in
my
fridge
i
had
a
nice
finger
of
bonewhite
head
but
the
humidity
here
is
astounding
and
it
took
a
powder
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
i
could
definitely
smell
alcohol
heat
along
with
the
lager
sweetness
on
the
nose
standing
by
to
have
my
butt
kicked
for
my
transgression
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slight
heat
on
the
tongue
i
noted
the
burnt
popcorn
mentioned
by
ewaldeichstaett
but
as
a
taste
rather
than
a
smell
it
was
odd
but
i
have
tolerated
far
worse
finish
had
the
immediate
dryness
associated
with
malt
liquors
and
the
manipulation
of
the
yeast
to
produce
a
high
abv
quickly
whew
one
unexpected
result
of
the
canquest
tm
is
that
i
have
become
quite
familiar
with
and
lets
call
a
spade
a
spade
here
cheaply
made
lagers
and
the
flavors
they
produce
i
would
be
interested
to
try
this
from
a
can
but
i
cannot
recommend
it
to
the
casual
lager
drinker
there
are
just
so
many
better
lagerstyle
beers
available
that
to
foist
this
on
someone
would
be
too
much
for
even
bro
woody
to
forgive
the
beer
tastes
decent
at
least
there
is
some
flavor
to
the
beer
malty
with
a
touch
of
hops
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
little
although
it
is
not
as
present
as
i
expected
the
beer
has
quite
a
bit
of
body
to
it
all
in
all
it
tastes
like
a
regular
carlsberg
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
added
i
actually
really
liked
this
beer
as
a
carlsberg
fan
in
general
i
figured
id
give
elephant
a
shot
when
the
opportunity
presented
itself
to
me
at
a
swiss
beers
of
the
world
shop
i
bought
it
in
bottle
form
and
was
instantly
surprised
to
see
its
relatively
high
alcohol
content
72
now
as
a
canadian
beer
aficionado
this
instantly
made
me
curious
and
upon
tasting
it
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
tastes
a
lot
like
the
usual
carlsberg
meaning
quite
carbonated
strong
taste
of
corn
and
hops
which
i
do
quite
appreciate
overall
a
really
nice
beer
catches
up
with
you
surprisingly
quickly
for
a
beer
so
be
mindful
of
the
alcohol
content
give
it
a
try
drinkability
the
sweet
taste
doesnt
do
much
to
hide
the
higher
abv
content
of
this
beer
however
i
did
not
find
it
hard
to
finish
overall
its
a
fairly
simple
mediocre
lager
that
delivers
the
punch
when
its
needed
nothing
to
seek
out
but
if
your
caught
in
a
bad
spot
better
than
most
marcos
pours
a
rich
ambergold
with
plenty
of
head
and
lacing
this
nice
7
2
abv
lager
has
a
nicely
floral
nose
and
a
balanced
malty
flavor
profile
not
too
challenging
or
challenging
but
certainly
enjoyable
and
easygoing
a
good
solid
beer
with
a
surprising
alcohol
kick
not
exactly
my
favourite
lager
drinkability
this
is
little
more
than
a
slightlytweaked
malt
liquor
in
a
european
label
dont
be
fooled
d
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
try
this
again
given
the
lack
of
interesting
flavors
in
the
taste
d
in
the
end
itll
pack
an
unexpected
punch
for
how
light
and
moderately
refreshing
it
is
and
for
what
it
is
its
definitely
drinkable
a
fair
session
beer
to
get
drunk
off
of
if
thats
what
youre
shooting
for
otherwise
its
much
like
any
other
eurostyle
lager
ill
confess
when
i
bought
this
i
wasnt
looking
for
quality
but
quantity
it
was
on
sale
at
the
liquor
store
and
some
buddies
and
i
had
a
party
coming
up
it
kept
me
from
buying
a
30
of
natty
so
i
cant
complain
that
said
this
isnt
a
good
beer
golden
yellow
honey
color
with
some
chunks
of
sediment
floating
around
pretty
respectable
head
about
two
inches
of
thick
white
foam
this
beer
does
not
smell
good
i
dont
want
to
be
one
of
those
guys
that
compares
a
beers
characteristics
to
puke
but
thats
pretty
much
what
we
have
here
a
vomit
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
very
grainy
and
chemical
alcohol
is
presant
which
makes
for
an
astingent
solvent
like
flavor
its
not
good
but
you
can
get
it
down
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
an
old
english
800
or
some
other
hard
core
forty
ounce
malt
liquor
the
only
reason
to
drink
something
that
tastes
like
this
is
for
a
quick
cheap
buzz
the
problem
is
this
stuff
is
not
cheap
if
you
want
a
cheap
drunk
go
for
a
forty
in
a
paper
bag
if
you
want
to
spend
the
money
on
a
six
pack
of
quality
beer
dont
go
anywhere
near
this
d
i
cant
find
a
reason
for
anyone
buying
this
beer
besides
the
obviuos
it
makes
you
drunk
faster
compared
to
macrobeers
at
5
abv
ive
been
on
a
beer
tasting
kick
for
the
last
few
months
or
so
and
so
far
i
have
tried
about
fifty
beers
and
this
is
the
worst
one
yet
it
doesnt
ever
really
taste
like
beer
honestly
it
tasted
like
it
was
rotten
i
dont
recommend
it
cool
bottle
though
poured
from
an
11
2
ounce
green
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
golden
rod
yellow
murky
color
almost
no
carbonation
and
no

spices

the

a
lot
of
yeast
some
honey

hidden
drinkable

is
okay

2
fingers
of
fluff
white
that
receedes
to
a
super
thin

some

smells
sweet
thats
about
it
first
sip
i
took
i
thought
tootsiepop
for
some
reason
sweet
and
bitter
the
alcohol
does
show
through
some
med
bod
and
decent
carbonation
i
could
see
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
feel
if
they
toned
down
the
alcohol
content
a
bit
this
would
be
a
more
enjoyable
brew
you
know
what
they
say
happiness
is
being
danish
in
this
case
im
proud
d
didnt
expect
much
but
i
hoped
for
something
a
little
better
the
beer
isnt
skunked
thanks
probably
to
the
oxide
killing
sulphites
but
being
aware
of
preservative
content
is
also
a
turn
off
i
just
cant
finish
this
glass
highly
recommended
overall
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
it
goes
without
saying
that
there
are
far
better
brews
out
there
but
this
is
actually
quite
good
for
a
malt
liquor
well
done
d
the
smell
and
flavor
kill
it
after
a
few
of
something
else
this
would
be
a
great
way
to
keep
going
though
at
7
2
you
might
regret
it
in
the
morning
d
this
tastes
like
someone
took
regular
carlsberg
and
refermented
it
in
his
basement
to
up
the
alcohol
content
there
are
so
many
better
beers
i
can
think
of
that
have
higher
abv
levels
and
taste
delicious
all
of
them
ales
i
dont
think
lagers
were
meant
to
be
highalcohol
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
at
all
of
this
one
i
honestly
cant
see
what
my
dad
sees
in
this
its
one
of
his
favorites
and
im
struggling
through
a
bottle
i
dont
think
i
would
pay
for
this
again
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
free
one
in
the
name
of
fatherson
bonding
drinkability
runs
strong
here
i
liked
elephant
beer
actually
and
think
it
would
go
great
with
seafood
dishes
easy
to
drink
though
not
really
much
flavor
or
anything
else
noteworthy
poured
from
a
green
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
hops
and
malts
taste
is
of
alcohol
with
some
hoppiness
feels
rather
light
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
about
average
considering
the
abv
this
is
a
fairly
decent
brew
i
think
carlsberg
beer
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
pale
lagers
out
there
and
to
make
elephant
i
think
they
just
inject
it
with
steroids
not
a
lot
of
character
or
nuance
just
a
big
boozey
hit
its
interesting
but
flavourwise
i
dont
think
its
wholly
successful
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
coating
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
heavy
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
overall
is
just
okay
at
best
the
flavor
are
all
over
the
place
and
there
is
no
uniformity
i
only
was
as
generous
on
the
scoring
as
i
was
because
i
was
comparing
it
to
other
malt
liquors
which
i
have
had
conclusion
its
like
an
american
malt
liquor
but
with
a
bit
more
depthcharacter
prickly
mild
carbonation
takes
away
some
of
the
flavour
thank
god
rr
d
drinkable
on
occation
if
you
need
a
beer
for
the
buzz
and
dont
want
to
go
for
a
malt
liquer
deal
aok
with
me
it
looks
good
for
the
color
which
is
golden
with
a
nice
thick
head
the
smell
is
by
far
nothing
to
write
home
about
with
only
hints
of
the
ingredients
the
taste
is
mediocre
as
it
gets
which
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
canadian
light
beer
but
it
does
taste
like
a
beer
another
mediocre
on
the
feel
too
it
goes
down
smooth
so
there
is
another
positive
assessment
drink
this
beer
if
you
want
to
play
a
drinking
game
in
denmark
but
save
your
money
in
being
a
beer
condenser
drinkability
a
bland
vapid
lager
gifted
with
a
bulky
alcoholic
character
makes
for
a
somewhat
unpleasant
drink
skip
it
golden
bodied
with
a
big
pillowy
white
head
that
leaves
wispy
rings
of
lace
behind
a
big
whiff
of
skunk
hit
my
nose
as
i
cracked
the
cap
that
has
since
dissapated
after
decanting
into
a
glass
and
waiting
a
minute
now
i
get
euro
hops
toasted
grain
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
this
beer
tastes
like
a
euro
version
of
a
malt
liquor
more
hoppy
and
less
sweet
grittiness
than
u
s
versions
though
finishes
a
little
hot
medium
light
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
if
it
was
2
00
a
40
oz
but
not
for
ten
bucks
a
sixer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
a
7
2
abv
it
packs
a
little
punch
for
a
little
bottle
elephant
is
alright
but
nothing
more
its
priced
the
same
as
carlsbergs
flagship
lager
at
least
where
i
live
and
its
crisp
but
with
a
bigger
boozier
punch
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
probably
not
simply
because
there
are
any
number
of
macrostyle
euro
lagers
that
i
would
opt
for
if
thats
all
i
had
to
choose
from
along
the
lines
of
a
stella
artois
or
heinekenhl
on
draft
so
at
the
liquor
store
i
work
at
i
have
people
buying
this
stuff
by
the
case
and
i
have
got
to
try
and
see
what
the
hype
is
about
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
short
lived
head
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malts
with
a
faint
cereal
aroma
the
taste
was
mellow
with
a
sweet
corn
and
cereal
grain
quality
and
a
warming
but
stingy
finish
d
nothing
spectacular
about
any
of
the
individual
parts
but
not
a
terrible
thing
to
drink
its
just
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
a
golden
yellow
delivery
product
id
rather
drink
an
ipa
with
the
same
abv
if
alcohol
was
the
only
reason
to
drink
d
the
warmer
this
beer
got
the
more
i
can
taste
it
the
more
i
can
taste
it
the
less
i
like
it
ones
enough
for
me
this
is
really
quite
bad
it
will
get
you
drunk
it
doesnt
taste
horrible
but
really
undesirable
i
will
not
drink
this
again
unless
it
is
a
last
resort
im
not
going
to
finish
this
pours
a
pale
golden
with
creamy
pillowy
head
that
leaves
a
creamy
lace
head
sustains
longer
than
i
would
have
imagined
smell
upon
opening
the
green
bottle
was
mildly
skunkpungentmarijuanafunk
taste
is
suprisingly
clean
crisp
and
dry
no
discernable
taste
other
than
the
hint
of
high
abv
mouthfeel
is
thin
almost
watery
but
there
is
something
there
slight
graininess
that
keeps
it
from
having
no
flavor
at
all
recommended
only
if
youve
never
tried
it
d
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
not
something
i
would
completely
avoid
at
over
7
abv
this
beer
could
pack
a
punch
but
the
overall
taste
wouldnt
allow
it
to
be
one
of
those
beers
that
sneaks
up
on
you
youd
see
it
comin
d
this
is
no
better
or
worse
than
any
other
euro
lager
at
least
its
robust
that
sets
it
apart
from
many
other
lagers
in
this
style
even
if
it
doesnt
necessarily
make
it
better
id
be
curious
to
see
how
this
stands
up
to
an
american
macro
ice
beer
or
malt
liquor
how
much
of
the
appeal
here
is
its
euro
label
d
the
skunky
taste
is
too
much
for
me
for
those
who
can
handle
the
skunk
smell
and
taste
this
one
might
not
be
bad
overall
another
bad
beer
from
carlsberg
avoid
they
should
put
more
money
into
jacobsen
and
spend
less
on
these
kind
of
products
not
a
lot
of
life
here
which
i
was
surprised
by
given
the
abv
on
this
even
a
sharper
feel
of
booze
might
have
been
welcomed
by
me
i
think
the
elephant
forgot
to
bring
flavor
into
its
own
beer
this
is
a
pretty
boozy
strong
tasting
lager
it
could
be
worse
but
its
pretty
unworthy
of
actively
seeking
out
overall
impression
this
malt
liquor
tastes
like
malt
liquor
thats
really
about
all
there
is
to
say
about
it
not
a
repeat
buy
d
not
bad
but
wont
be
on
my
list
to
get
again
d
not
really
a
beer
i
want
to
revisit
i
remember
thinking
this
beer
was
a
big
deal
back
in
the
90s
not
so
much
now
golden
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
with
pretty
decent
staying
power
aroma
has
that
damn
skunk
smell
taste
is
grassy
and
pretty
gross
not
a
very
appealing
beer
in
any
way
i
guess
good
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
im
glad
i
gave
this
a
try
but
its
time
to
move
on
the
taste
is
like
a
malt
liquor
with
some
light
bitter
herbal
hops
thrown
in
it
is
sweetly
malty
grapeyalcoholic
with
some
grain
and
an
herbalpine
bitterness
its
not
bad
generally
pleasant
drinkable
smooth
with
nothing
unpleasant
not
a
good
beer
at
all
ive
had
much
better
pale
lagers
than
this
im
not
sure
where
they
were
going
with
it
d
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
not
much
taste
or
personality
and
a
very
harsh
quality
to
it
pass
drinkability
the
bottle
says
malt
liquor
thats
what
this
is
im
pretty
sure
do
not
buy
it
first
things
first
theres
nothing
patently
offensive
about
this
beerbravo
thats
not
an
easy
accomplishment
for
a
highalcohol
macro
lager
in
green
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
nonexistent
however
i
got
a
hint
of
strange
scented
candlelike
spice
i
wouldnt
expect
in
beer
the
flavor
opens
with
smooth
bready
malts
and
finishes
with
a
big
lager
tang
in
most
beer
this
tang
is
unpleasant
and
astringent
but
here
it
comes
off
more
like
a
mix
of
strong
perfume
and
fruit
punch
still
not
something
you
usually
demand
in
a
fine
beer
but
this
could
be
worse
pours
a
nice
golden
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
white
head
with
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
malty
very
slight
hops
with
some
citrus
medium
body
not
drinkable
i
would
not
buy
this
brew
again
elephant
beer
basically
comes
across
on
the
tongue
as
exactly
what
it
is
a
strong
lager
its
like
carlsberg
just
took
its
flagship
beer
and
poured
a
bit
more
alcohol
into
the
mix
and
the
overwhelmingly
alcoholic
character
kills
any
real
drinkability
that
the
beer
would
most
likely
otherwise
possess
undercarbonated
and
slick
and
not
particularly
exciting
meh
huge
off
white
head
clung
very
well
to
my
glass
i
was
surprised
and
it
laced
well
too
strong
aromas
of
alcohol
some
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
of
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
hoppy
middle
and
then
sour
mashed
malt
at
the
end
bitter
and
flavors
as
taut
as
a
corset
like
a
punchy
pilsner
dont
care
for
the
aftertaste
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
body
too
bad
the
flavors
arent
better
because
otherwise
this
could
be
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
great
initial
head
although
it
fades
fast
with
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
scent
extremely
malty
with
a
little
sourskunkiness
good
taste
a
deep
malt
flavor
with
some
good
hop
finishing
with
bites
of
sweetness
it
goes
down
fine
but
a
bit
rough
a
nice
strong
lager
d
drinkable
but
lots
better
available
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
didnt
make
for
a
pleasant
overall
experience
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
way
more
body
than
i
expected
moderate
carbonation
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
but
not
by
that
much
d
not
terrible
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
again
cant
say
that
this
brew
is
recommended
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
bit
high
on
the
carbonation
side
dont
drink
these
on
an
empty
stomach
as
they
can
burn
quickly
either
way
this
is
a
good
malt
liquor
a
bit
pricey
but
good
had
a
smooth
flow
with
some
hopiness
and
citrus
coming
off
but
then
a
rather
nasty
backbite
the
abv
more
than
crept
in
and
overpowered
the
hops
and
the
maltiness
in
the
middle
and
while
this
is
a
passible
beer
ill
pass
when
offered
again
d
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
somebody
it
has
a
bad
taste
with
a
very
weak
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
grain
going
with
it
and
the
way
this
one
goes
it
doesnt
even
come
close
to
tasting
good
theres
some
bitterness
there
as
well
mostly
in
the
finish
but
wow
this
is
a
very
rough
brew
and
im
going
to
find
it
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
and
not
just
because
of
the
abv
this
is
a
ghastly
beer
ok
i
cant
take
it
any
more
down
the
drain
dit
packs
a
nice
punchand
the
label
looks
kind
of
coolbutill
stick
to
the
regular
carlsberg
pils
from
now
on
my
overall
impression
from
my
tasting
notes
were
that
this
beer
is
basically
a
heineken
on
steroids
a
good
overall
brew
good
session
beer
oh
and
pour
it
out
shit
this
stuff
sucks
straight
out
of
the
can
edit
the
reviews
make
it
sound
like
the
canned
version
is
better
than
the
bottles
it
seems
to
alleviate
the
smell
issues
still
barely
worth
trying
in
this
format
an
okay
beer
except
fo
the
godawful
smell
plug
your
nose
and
enjoy
in
all
tastes
like
cheap
corny
malt
liquor
with
a
big
dash
of
hops
thrown
in
that
were
left
to
sit
out
in
the
light
too
long
not
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
i
cant
see
myself
ordering
one
in
a
pub
unless
that
pub
is
in
denmark
in
that
case
id
certainly
try
one
on
draft
friends
give
it
a
try
as
you
might
be
pleasantly
surprised
this
just
isnt
a
very
good
beernot
a
total
dud
but
not
one
ill
buy
again
when
cold
its
fine
but
there
are
scores
of
better
strong
lagers
worth
buying
di
doubt
i
will
have
another
one
of
these
in
my
time
it
was
ok
to
try
overal
it
didnt
quiet
win
me
over
and
i
wouldnt
want
a
pint
of
it
the
little
bottle
i
had
was
enough
i
did
have
a
draught
one
years
ago
at
a
trade
fair
in
berlin
but
i
cant
recall
much
about
the
day
let
alone
which
beers
i
enjoyed
the
most
if
you
want
a
decent
tasting
beer
for
a
reasonable
price
that
will
also
get
you
feeling
fine
this
beer
is
for
you
d
you
can
drink
this
beer
and
a
good
amount
of
it
the
alcohol
does
not
cut
into
the
taste
but
overall
id
pass
on
this
beer
if
other
beers
are
available
something
about
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
just
did
not
bode
well
with
me
oelergud
pours
an
amber
yellow
into
the
glass
with
a
short
white
head
that
had
a
little
bit
of
volume
to
it
the
aroma
was
of
hops
really
with
some
light
malts
in
the
base
the
flavor
was
a
bit
different
it
had
some
light
malty
taste
but
i
was
expecting
more
hops
from
the
aroma
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
strong
and
it
has
a
harsh
kick
to
it
but
that
is
due
to
the
higher
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
i
think
it
should
be
smoother
but
overall
its
ok
and
ok
to
drink
very
easy
beer
to
drink
drank
five
for
this
review
and
could
easily
have
had
more
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
for
another
one
of
these
for
awhile
lots
of
better
stuff
out
there
in
my
opinion
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
if
under
the
guise
of
another
labelcompany
might
be
considered
a
good
beer
its
quite
simple
but
doesnt
have
any
strong
negatives
either
a
good
beer
worth
trying
dont
hate
i
probably
would
never
buy
it
again
though
drinkability
great
drinking
mediumstrong
brew
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
but
can
hit
like
a
herd
of
elephants
it
if
thats
what
youre
after
so
far
the
worst
oldworld
brew
ive
tried
pours
a
paleish
amber
colour
with
a
rather
thick
head
that
lasts
for
quite
a
while
it
smells
rather
sweet
almost
floral
initial
taste
is
rather
passionfruity
but
doesnt
have
the
sweetness
the
big
turnoff
for
me
is
that
it
leaves
a
very
very
bitter
aftertaste
i
didnt
find
that
it
had
much
of
a
body
to
it
either
as
far
as
mouthfeel
im
thankful
i
only
bought
the
one
bottle
im
a
little
disappointed
as
i
quite
like
the
regular
carlsberg
fortunately
i
dont
have
to
buy
this
one
again
pours
a
darkish
golden
color
with
lots
of
creamychunky
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
i
really
cant
smell
anything
on
this
beer
the
taste
is
very
sweet
from
the
alcohol
and
a
little
from
pale
lager
malt
theres
a
bunch
of
hoppy
bitterness
there
as
well
some
sort
of
noble
hops
i
believe
the
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
fairly
creamy
not
bad
at
all
overall
its
fairly
drinkable
but
its
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
d
an
easy
to
drink
malt
liquor
taste
can
be
a
bit
offputting
at
times
but
better
than
most
american
representations
of
the
style
d
not
terrible
not
worth
another
try
this
brew
isnt
too
bad
for
a
euro
macro
with
bite
pours
an
almost
orange
color
with
a
very
thing
head
and
minimal
lacing
never
heard
of
this
style
before
aroma
is
very
strong
of
malts
and
alcohol
must
be
the
european
equivalent
of
american
malt
liquor
says
so
on
the
label
anyway
the
taste
is
very
strong
and
somewhat
unbalanced
theres
a
rough
bitterness
upfront
that
doesnt
go
down
as
smooth
the
aftertaste
is
grainy
and
full
of
alcohol
ive
had
better
malt
liquors
i
cant
rate
this
one
very
high
now
that
ive
tried
this
beer
i
see
no
need
to
do
so
ever
again
its
drinkable
but
sos
water
and
its
skunkfree
on
the
other
hand
denmark
is
now
off
the
list
of
countries
i
need
to
try
a
beer
from
overall
better
than
expected
but
not
something
i
feel
a
need
to
have
regularly
overall
quite
drinkable
and
hides
its
alcohol
contect
quite
well
which
might
be
dangerous
goes
down
very
easy
good
session
brew
d
although
there
isnt
anything
special
about
this
beer
its
still
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
a
bit
underimpressed
with
this
as
a
specialty
beer
but
as
a
macro
lager
i
was
quite
pleased
i
would
rather
have
this
then
most
other
macros
i
have
tried
but
i
would
rather
not
havea
macro
at
all
if
you
follow
that
anyway
if
its
around
give
it
a
shot
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
appearance
is
a
light
murky
yelloworange
with
a
light
head
that
quickly
goes
away
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
orange
honey
taste
of
light
malt
hops
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
orange
honey
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
beer
i
think
id
buy
again
although
it
was
at
a
good
price
at
the
local
grocery
outlet
store
so
for
the
money
it
was
worth
a
try
well
what
to
say
in
the
end
for
me
as
long
as
i
can
easily
name
an
occasion
with
which
to
match
a
certain
beer
then
its
a
beer
worth
drinking
its
not
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
im
having
trouble
placing
it
with
such
an
occasion
perhaps
the
beer
du
jour
prior
to
attending
a
european
football
soccer
match
hooliganism
anyone
d
decent
enough
but
not
too
often
given
the
sweetness
and
price
i
know
i
can
buy
much
more
balanced
and
cheaper
aussie
micros
than
this
d
not
bad
not
great
probably
will
not
purchase
again
since
it
is
so
expensive
and
only
average
overall
note
ive
entertained
the
idea
that
maybe
this
beer
was
lightstruck
it
is
imported
and
the
bottles
are
green
if
someone
wants
to
send
me
a
bottle
of
elephant
to
prove
that
it
really
is
denmarks
greatest
gift
to
the
world
thats
fine
but
i
sure
as
hell
wont
pay
money
for
this
stuff
it
is
taste
where
this
beer
departs
from
the
nomenclature
of
malt
liquor
and
into
the
euro
strong
lager
category
most
malt
liquors
are
very
sweet
malty
and
frankly
blah
this
beer
really
hits
home
with
its
similarity
with
euro
lagers
granted
there
is
much
more
malt
to
this
beer
but
it
is
complemented
with
a
nice
citrusy
twinge
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
also
good
more
along
with
a
malt
liquors
fullness
but
drinkability
is
much
better
when
thinking
about
the
taste
and
smell
this
is
one
beer
that
will
get
you
drunk
but
wont
leave
you
with
as
bad
a
taste
in
your
mouth
as
with
a
crappy
malt
liquor
d
i
could
drink
one
of
these
if
i
just
wanted
to
catch
a
buzz
the
best
danish
brew
ive
had
i
like
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
why
is
this
the
only
carlsberg
i
can
find
in
the
store
i
just
want
some
of
the
original
stuff
rest
assured
that
i
wont
get
this
again
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
hard
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
i
got
this
because
it
seemed
interesting
and
it
was
something
i
hadnt
tried
in
the
createyourown6pack
section
of
world
market
pours
a
very
nice
orangeyellow
with
very
little
head
and
not
so
much
lacing
but
decent
carbonation
the
smell
didnt
impress
me
it
smelled
a
lot
like
cheap
beer
and
only
after
it
warmed
a
bit
did
some
sweetness
come
through
in
the
smell
i
was
generally
surprised
at
the
taste
after
i
smelled
it
it
has
a
good
amount
of
sweeness
with
some
citrus
flavors
its
a
little
acidic
in
the
mouth
but
it
goes
down
easily
and
i
may
even
detect
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
something
thats
oftent
classified
as
a
malt
liquor
carlsberg
elephant
beer

a
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
green
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
bit
skunky
but
mostly
just
grainy
there
is
a
decent
hop
taste
and
a
bit
of
grain
not
as
bad
as
i
remembered
it
but
i
still
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
call
it
your
advocates
natural
ice
really
id
say
its
cheaper
tasting
pastuerized
forerunner
to
dogfish
heads
excellent
malt
liquor
for
what
it
costs
well
worth
it
pours
an
orange
gold
with
continuous
fizzing
from
carbonation
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
mostly
a
sour
tinge
with
some
sweetness
hidden
noticable
alcohol
content
in
the
taste
with
little
else
much
like
a
miller
high
life
with
a
little
more
grit
and
sweet
i
can
tell
hops
are
hiding
in
there
somewhere
but
its
very
light
moderate
to
light
bodied
the
alcohol
content
is
the
one
attribute
this
has
over
an
american
macro
d
this
beer
was
strong
and
malty
it
seemed
a
little
unbalanced
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
i
have
positive
feelings
about
this
one
because
once
upon
a
time
i
drank
this
with
a
danish
friend
i
remember
him
being
proud
of
this
danish
beer
d
not
very
tasty
but
goes
down
easily
in
spite
of
that
fact
not
filling
at
all
despite
all
of
the
bad
qualities
of
this
beer
it
is
not
the
worst
that
i
have
ever
had
however
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
liked
it
because
really
did
not
there
are
plenty
of
more
flavorful
beers
out
there
with
a

or
higher

you
are

for

but

not
a
drinkable
beer
simply
because
of
the
poor
taste
this
malt
liquor
pours

very
slightly
hazed
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
of
whit
foam
sitting
atop
the
smell
is
a
little
malty
some
light
struck
aroma
maybe
the
slightest
tinge
of
floral

and
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
of
slightly
malty
grain
some
warming
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
balancing
hop
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
that
definatly
packs
a
punch
but
its
kind
of
one
dimensional
and
thin
goes
down
easy
enough
but
it
nothing
that
special
in
my
book
i
just
dont
have
alot
to
say
about
it
other
than
it
tastes
like
heineken
only
stronger
it
looks
like
some
regular
domestic
stuff
and
it
just
plain
isnt
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
pours
a
hazed
pale

with
a
dense
and

great
retention

an
nice
strong
aroma
pale
base
malt
and
pilsener
malt
are
immediatly
sweet
but
are
quickly
overshadowed
by
an
assertive
adjunct
flavor
possibly
corn
or
rice
or
a
combination
but
not
neccesarily
bad
passable
for
the
style
anyway
semidryng
aftertaste
with
a
saaztettnanger
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
that
fails
to
balance
out
the
strong
adjunct
taste
medium
body
and
lighter
carbonation
allow
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
however
a
highly
crisp
carbonation
might
have
softened
the
blow
of
the
cloyingly
sweet
adjunct
better
an
good
drinkability
for
a
euro
strong
lagermalt
liquor
though
the
offflavor
is
restricted
to
the
aftertaste
and
the
finish
shows
only
some
saaz
flavor
and
mild
residual
sweetness
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
most
american
malt
liquors

skunked
green

but
like
no
other
skunk
sensation
before
harsh
alcohol
is
the
first
feature
that
sticks
out
skunking
has
removed
any
dimension
of
malt
so
youre
left
with
a
mouthfeel
of
rubbing
alcohol
low
carbonation
doesnt
help
gross
really
this
was
quickest
drain
pour
and
drain
pours
are
very
rare
for
me
simply
one
of
if
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
do
not
recommend
what
so
ever
i
seem
to
concur
with
most
of
the
reviewers
for
this
beer
when
i
say
its
somewhere
between
marginally
good
and
okay
pours
and
settles
a
slightly
ruddy
golden
yellow
thin
white
head
fades
to
a
cloudy
solid
film
over
the
top
of
the
brew
smell
is
sweet
sharp
and
fruity
starts
creamy
and
calm
but
immediately
fullbodied
settles
with
a
slight
caramel
flavor
and
malt
smoothness
which
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
bland
but
unmistakable
group
of
bitters
finishes
sharply
hoppy
and
almost
wet
sandy
texture
has
a
lasting
but
somewhat
pleasant
aftertaste
drinkability
i
would
rate
as
good
i
didnt
fall
in
love
with
this
beer
but
it
did
have
an
interesting
flavor
and
i
might
try
em
again
id
never
guess
that
this
beer
was
a
high
alcohol
beer
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
im
not
real
fond
of
the
aftertaste
but
it
is
really
a
good
beer
to
try
some
metallic
elements
are
also
noticed
dry
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
reasonably
drinkable
but
a
little
too
sweet
overall
i
think
this
is
an
okay
beer
and
would
have
it
again
i
dont
think
its
anything
to
write
home
about
but
i
do
feel
that
the
ratings
for
this
are
autoimatically
low
due
to
carlsberg
being
perceived
as
somewhat
of
a
macrobrew
of
europe
drinkability
man
am
i
sorry
i
got
suckered
into
buying
this
one
i
wanted
a
nice
pilsner
before
going
out
tonight
and
i
wound
up
drinking
a
malt
liquor
anyway
out
on
a
charter
fishing
boat
i
had
a
six
pack
of
this
85
degrees
f
sittining
in
the
sun
this
beer
was
perfect
even
when
the
cooler
couldnt
keep
it
cool
it
was
a
refreshing
drink
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
but
id
have
never
guessed
it
was
7
2
it
had
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
flavor
i
thought
which
reminded
me
of
some
of
my
favorite
ales
color
is
golden
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
head
is
medium
height
creamy
and
on
the
thick
side
for
a
lager
aroma
has
a
grainy
sweetness
alongside
mild
skunking
herbal
hop
is
noted
as
well
taste
has
a
pleasant
grainy
sweetness
that
actually
works
well
with
the
adjunct
flavors
noted
here
the
herbal
hop
flavor
is
the
star
here
strong
and
tasty
drinkability
is
high
even
at
7
2
abv
pours
out
to
a
slightly
hazed
light
yellow
color
with
a
head
of
foam
that
remained
consistant
at
about
a
half
inch
lots
of
lace
aromas
were
buttery
with
malt
and
sweet
creamy
notes
nice
taste
was
quite
quaffable
yeasty
bread
and
buttery
malts
mixed
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
sweet
citrus
well
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
kind
of
creamy
definitly
not
what
i
was
expecting
drinkability
is
good
for
a
so
called
malt
liquor
id
have
this
again
no
question
recommended
for
sampling
surprise
to
find
the
ratings
so
low
i
rather
enjoyed
it
has
a
bright
golden
straw
color
with
a
lightly
oily
appearance
a
fluffy
stark
white
head
that
held
its
retention
rather
well
smells
sweetly
malty
pilsner
malt
and
hopped
particularly
high
the
malts
take
on
fruity
characters
of
peach
pears
apples
and
a
light
corn
sugar
flavor
hops
start
off
a
little
musks
and
almost
lightstriken
but
balances
well
to
contribute
a
well
balanced
bittering
and
an
earthy
flavor
full
and
creamy
almost
thick
to
the
mouth
would
finish
very
clean
and
crisp
if
not
for
such
bold
sweetness
alcohols
contribute
a
warmth
and
drying
quality
from
midpoint
into
the
finish
surprised
the
corn
flavors
never
become
dominant
or
distracting
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
i
heard
about
this
beer
on
one
of
my
favorite
directors
roger
avarys
website
so
i
decided
ide
see
what
it
was
all
about
comes
in
a
green
bottle
with
a
pretty
cool
looking
elephant
on
the
label
poured
an
unimpressive
golden
color
with
a
light
white
lace
that
lasted
throughout
smell
was
very
grainy
and
a
bit
salty
as
well
giving
it
a
less
then
inviting
nose
taste
wasnt
much
better
lots
and
lots
of
malt
on
the
tongue
and
cereal
grain
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
drinkability
if
you
want
a
stronger
beer
that
will
probably
get
you
wasted
then
by
all
means
but
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
with
this
brew
cant
say
i
too
fond
of
this
one
reminded
me
of
a
heinken
crossed
with
malt
liquor
not
drinkable
too
cloying
in
a
word
horrid
drinkability
good
versus
the
styl
not
too
good
against
a
good
craft
brew
at
heart
its
a
malt
liquor
ive
had
worse
but
this
wasnt
created
to
be
art
its
the
sort
of
beer
you
buy
if
youre
trying
to
get
whammed
in
a
hurry
not
something
i
think
ill
buy
again
crystal
clear
gold
liquid
pours
from
a
green
bottle
and
produces
a
soft
white
head
of
moderate
size
moderate
carbonation
the
appearance
is
fairly
unremarkable
the
aroma
is
laden
with
corn
and
sulfury
hop
smells
theres
also
alcohol
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
grass
and
grain
quality
its
not
particularly
enticing
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
sweet
and
alcohol
with
some
pale
malt
flavor
moderate
body
which
is
maybe
just
slightly
tilted
to
the
watery
side
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
this
is
decent
unfortunately
its
still
forgettable
theres
nothing
at
all
to
recommend
this
beer
other
than
the
fact
that
it
isnt
offensive
to
those
who
can
tolerate
the
style
since
even
passably
good
beer
should
be
judged
by
a
higher
standard
than
that
i
cant
recommend
carlsburgs
version
of
a
euro
strong
lagermalt
liquor
it
has
been
said
that
elephants
never
forget
that
may
be
true
but
i
wont
remember
much
about
this
elephant
within
minutes
of
draining
the
glass
not
a
very
good
beer
im
not
even
sure
im
going
to
finish
this
bottle
sweet
grainy
grassy
taste
very
typical
for
a
euro
lager
the
major
difference
here
is
that
the
carlsberg
elephant
has
a
funky
rubbing
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
that
leaves
an
unpleasant
flavor
on
your
tastebuds
its
great
that
this
beer
has
a
7
2
abv
but
the
flavor
of
this
beer
isnt
so
great
an
average
to
below
average
beer
with
some
power
to
it
nothing
special
just
a
mass
market
beer
with
a
little
extra
alcohol
kick
i
like
this
brew
not
something
i
would
have
all
the
time
but
i
believe
it
to
be
quite
good
i
wouldnt
mind
pounding
some
of
these
babies
to
help
with
a
cold
winter
trek
somewhere
the
alcohol
would
sure
help
notes
not
much
to
say
about
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
disappears
fast
the
aroma
is
pleasant
malt
and
alcohol
with
some
grassiness
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
not
hidden
at
all
the
most
prominent
part
of
the
flavor
is
the
alcohol
burn
you
feel
slide
down
your
throat
before
that
this
beer
is
very
grassy
the
aftertaste
is
also
grassy
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
overall
drinking
this
beer
is
like
drinking
a
glass
of
my
lawn
the
beer
pours
a
light
orange
hue
with
a
little
cream
head
the
smell
is
very
skunky
at
first
the
green
bottle
just
dissapoints
once
again
once
you
get
past
the
skunk
you
can
smell
slight
wheat
and
buttered
toast
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malts
a
hint
of
buttered
yeast
will
float
around
light
and
overall
awful
stay
away
from
this
drinkability
in
spite
of
its
commonness
its
ok
to
drink
especially
if
youre
with
a
large
group
of
footy
fans
at
an
inner
city
english
pub
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
isnt
here
to
be
savoured
a
temporary
beer
the
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
left
good
lace
in
the
glass
my
first
whiff
was
very
slight
hops
and
bigger
malt
the
flavor
is
malty
almost
a
sweet
flavor
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
fresh
this
beer
tasted
the
second
bottle
was
every
bit
as
good
as
the
first
the
7
2
alcohol
was
not
evident
at
all
in
this
strong
lager
i
hate
that
malt
liquor
label
crap
it
conjures
up
immediate
visions
of
mickeys
or
colt
45
this
is
not
in
that
category
i
would
put
this
up
against
checkvar
or
pilsner
urquell
anyday
i
know
they
are
not
exactly
the
same
style
but
as
far
as
an
imported
lager
goes
they
are
close
i
would
strongly
recommend
anyone
who
rated
this
poorly
in
the
past
to
give
it
another
try
you
may
be
pleasently
surprised
i
was
pours
a
bright
uriney
yellow
gold
with
a
small
fizzy
offwhite
head
nose
is
reminiscent
of
a
standard
euro
pale
lager
light
cerealy
honeyish
malts
play
second
fiddle
to
a
slightly
skunky
hop
aroma
i
cant
catch
any
alcohol
fumes
luckily
taste
features
sweetish
malt
up
front
that
has
kind
of
a
syrupy
feel
to
it
light
toasted
cereal
in
there
too
hops
even
out
some
of
the
sweetness
with
some
skunky
bitterness
not
terribly
skunky
though
and
not
that
bitter
either
as
the
sweetness
lingers
into
the
slightly
burning
finish
not
bad
certainly
better
than
most
us
malt
liquors
i
can
remember
drinking
from
my
college
days
pachyderm
ghetto
juice
is
my
take
here
the
alcohol
is
7
2
by
volume
so
why
the
sulfites
for
a
preservative
or
for
taste
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
came
in
a
11
2
oz
green
bottle
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
an
orange
tint
only
a
little
head
remains
but
not
too
bad
for
a
lager
smell
quite
malty
but
pleasant
and
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
treat
mouthfeel
is
mediocre
and
not
very
carbonated
taste
is
strong
as
the
alcohol
content
would
indicate
but
youre
left
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
on
the
palate
i
dont
mind
that
but
its
a
little
more
than
youd
expect
from
a
lager
i
might
try
this
one
again
but
probably
not
for
a
while
this
one
was
new
at
my
local
shop
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
then
i
looked
at
the
reviews
and
nobody
seems
to
like
it
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
very
clean
color
the
aroma
is
very
grainy
with
some
hints
of
sweet
malt
very
skunky
smell
at
first
but
that
aroma
disappears
very
quickly
the
flavor
was
a
surprise
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
malt
character
and
a
bit
of
hopping
i
honestly
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
one
it
was
smooth
and
had
a
crisp
and
clean
flavor
i
honestly
cannot
think
of
a
positive
thing
about
this
beer
unless
you
are
into
pain
the
only
positive
is
that
it
will
be
a
nice
addition
to
my
bottle
collection
of
the
68
people
i
tried
to
pawn
my
24
bottles
of
elephant
off
to
nobody
liked
it
i
cant
recommend
this
brew
well
the
aroma
is
something
it
is
not
skunked
and
it
actually
has
a
dry
biscuit
like
note
to
it
the
beer
is
a
brilliant
gold
color
and
pours
with
half
way
decent
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
lightly
spicy
herbal
lemonlike
hoppiness
and
that
austere
grainy
character
a
clean
lightly
sweet
taste
from
the
malts
used
actually
the
taste
is
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
might
be
there
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
and
perhaps
an
herbal
hop
flavor
in
the
middle
as
well
there
is
an
interesting
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
minty
and
perhaps
a
weebit
offputting
but
it
is
ohsomuch
better
than
i
was
expecting
certainly
not
something
i
will
ever
pay
for
again
and
i
am
still
ashamed
that
i
bought
it
but
to
atone
for
my
transgression
i
have
ordered
a
case
of
cantillon
loerik
i
sort
of
like
this
beer
and
i
wonder
whether
some
of
the
lower
scores
are
based
on
the
canadian
version
ill
have
to
compare
and
contrast
pours
a
golden
pilsener
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
bready
malty
aromas
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
there
too
alcohol
punch
in
the
start
and
finish
with
some
maltiness
in
the
middle
not
entirely
enjoyable
in
the
sense
of
its
inbalance
towards
the
alcohol
side
while
not
retaining
beer
qualities
im
not
biased
against
malt
liquors
just
not
this
one
an
amazing
plain
and
placid
beer
for
the
alcohol
volume
very
1
sided
and
boring
dont
bother
pours
out
of
the
can
as
a
super
clean
light
amber
with
a
quick
fade
of
a
bright
white
head
not
bad
but
nothing
special
i
was
expecting
bad
though
the
malts
lend
out
a
good
mouthfeel
with
an
easy
going
flavor
there
is
a
small
bitter
balancing
in
the
finish
this
is
not
a
brew
which
i
would
seek
out
but
i
certainly
do
not
mind
drinking
it
draught
this
one
is
a
somewhat
golden
yellow
color
typical
big
fizzy
white
head
it
has
a
strong
alcohol
taste
there
are
some
malts
in
the
background
with
a
body
a
few
ticks
above
thin
seems
to
exist
for
the
buzz
factor
alone
perhaps
this
is
why
i
liked
it
in
college
but
am
not
as
keen
on
it
now

the
beer
pours
a

golden
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
has
a
slight
malty
aroma
that
is
pleasant
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
not

great

a
skunky
aftertaste
it

flavor
the
mouthfeel
is

it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
it
goes
down

this
beer
isnt
that
good
it
has
a
better
makeup
than
most
commercial
lagers
but
its
one
and
done
for
me
drinkability

sorry
id
like
to
think
of
something
positive
to
say
but
this
stuff
is
horrible
after
reading
what
people
have
said
about
this
brew
i
had
to
buy
a
couple
to
see
if
i
was
ignorant
because
ive
drank
this
many
a
time
and
found
it
to
be
satisfying
when
ive
called
upon
it
to
do
the
job
after
drinking
those
im
sticking
with
my
original
assessment
a
good
but
not
great
beer
a
malt
liquor
with
all
the
properties
of
most
crappy
lagers
except
for
a
slightly
stronger
and
sweeter
is
this
meant
to
be
favourable
taste
pours
clear
golden
tone
slight
head
smell
is
malty
and
some
hops
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
lagerish
types
and
oh
well
im
done
with
this
boring
brew
prost
used
to
drink
this
in
high
school
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
the
smell
is
well
not
revolting
but
offputting
a
bit
makes
me
think
of
urine
sickly
sweet
tasting
that
leaves
an
oily
coating
in
the
mouth
too
much
residual
sweetness
for
me
some
metallic
tastes
in
there
along
with
a
harsh
alcohol
i
thought
other
reviewers
were
being
unkind
to
this
beer
but
its
fair
to
say
that
this
beer
just
plain
sucks
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
i
could
help
it
i
dont
see
how
anyone
can
drink
this
and
enjoy
it
after
you
and
your
buddies
drink
a
few
of
these
youll
be
galloping
around
the
house
making
elephant
sounds
arrroooh
i
usually
dont
trash
a
beer
that
much
but
this
is
bad
bad
stuff
a
small
white
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
with
carbonation
and
the
hue
was
yellowgold
this
beer
left
a
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
nose
was
skunky
and
the
flavor
was
bitter
sour
tart
and
it
left
a
terrible
aftertaste
that
lingered
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
thin
watery
and
light
bodied
there
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
with
this
beer
sec
ooops
awhh
fell
into
my
sink
at
around
5
99
a
six
in
my
area
i
recommend
this
beer
transparent
gold
with
an
extremely
white
head
of
14
of
an
inch
actually
laces
the
glass
in
some
rings
malty
and
untoasted
grain
aromas
buckwheat
and
timothy
hay
mouthfeel
is
decent
silky
and
lighlty
carbonated
theres
little
sense
of
hop
balance
to
this
brew
not
surprising
but
still
this
had
a
decent
start
gets
cloying
at
the
third
sip
finishes
decently
dry
with
a
slight
sense
of
alcohol
i
suppose
if
it
has
to
be
a
malt
liquor
but
this
beer
does
not
deserve
to
command
its
premium
price

what
was

seemed

a
superb
afternoon
in
all
respects
theres
a
malty
syrupy
taste
that
okay
isnt
great
but
stops
it
being
flavourless
pretty
much
reminded
me
of
us
malt
liquor
as
it
turns
out
my
last
beer
from
malaysia
was
pretty
much
like
the
majority
of
the
others
i
tried
whilst
actually
in
the
the
country
and
proved
to
be
a
terrible
offering
theres
not
much
that
can
be
said
from
this
other
than
that
the
alcohol
content
wasnt
hidden
at
all
in
the
taste
and
overpowered
everything
else
the
beer
had
to
offer
which
was
a
real
shame
as
the
aroma
was
pretty
good
for
the
style
avoid
back
in
my
room
in
hong
kong
and
enjoying
some
beer
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
can
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
grains
taste
is
strong
of
alcohol
some
malts
mot
paticularly
pleasant
or
enjoyable
feels
light
in
e
mouth
and
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
i
cant
even
remember
if
i
finished
it
all
started
to
feel
dizzy
it
wont
produce
two
fingers
of
good
head
or
challenge
you
pallet
but
it
also
dosent
want
to
it
is
what
it
is
carlsberg
special
brew
what
was
i
expecting
let
me
be
concise
this
was
shit
smelling
cabbage
water
carbonated
with
farts
aged
in
camel
balls
and
coloured
with
fly
squash
this
vile
liquid
exists
in
its
asian
avatar
mostly
in
malaysia
so
unless
you
are
on
your
death
bed
because
of
dehydration
and
have
nothing
else
around
stay
away
this
beer
is
exceptional
compared
to
its
american
counterparts
i
consider
this
to
be
the
european
version
of
american
malt
liquor
and
high
gravity
lagers
which
is
the
preferred
fare
of
the
indigent
stateside
if
that
is
so
then
the
hobos
in
london
are
really
living
it
up
theyre
a
bit
more
posh
than
american
hobos
as
you
might
expect
the
smell
of
this
was
classic
bad
beer
taste
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
grainy
and
alcohol
but
in
addition
it
had
just
enough
astringency
to
accompany
the
alcohol
burn
it
was
perfect
and
the
hops
were
very
basic
they
didnt
add
any
undesirable
flavours
to
the
beer
just
a
basic
astringency
it
was
the
perfect
mix
of
grains
astringency
and
alcohol
and
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
either
like
the
american
counterparts
often
are
it
tasted
like
there
may
have
been
some
corn
syrup
adjunct
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
it
certainly
wasnt
overdone
to
the
same
extent
as
american
malt
liquors
this
is
a
prize
gem
in
hobo
beer
im
bringing
back
a
pack
to
the
states
please
try
any
chimay
trappist
beer
or
any
thing
not
based
on
euro
strong
beer
i
will
drink
the
special
beer
again
if
i
ever
do
get
a
chance
its
not
bad
but
not
that
special
really
there
are
much
better
beers
in
hong
kong
than
this
though
so
i
would
call
this
a
gimmick
beer
drinkability
for
a
8
8
abv
it
was
a
bit
bland
no
real
complexity
that
a
beer
of
that
strength
can
have
didnt
have
that
nice
hoppy
bite
or
crispness
a
good
lager
can
have
either
not
brilliant
but
when
compared
to
other
macrolagers
this
isnt
too
bad
and
i
found
it
easy
to
knock
back
d
overall
not
so
good
but
still
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
only
upside
is
that
it
is
a
shitty
beer
that
you
would
only
need
to
chug
a
few
of
to
be
pretty
far
gone
i
think
that
people
slammed
tis
beer
an
inappropriate
amount
probably
because
it
is
from
terrible
carlsberg
difficult
to
score
it
is
not
as
bad
as
some
claim
but
it
isnt
a
world
beater
either
appearance
is
just
as
youd
expect
pale
clear
and
yellow
some
head
not
much
retention
though
thanks
to
an
8
6
alcohol
content
aroma
is
surprisingly
light
considering
the
assault
on
the
senses
that
follows
light
alcohol
malt
tastes
like
someone
took
bud
light
and
dropped
in
a
shot
of
151
horrible
boozy
aftertaste
and
finish
i
found
myself
wincing
after
every
sip
mouthfeel
is
more
or
less
what
youd
expect
in
the
style
light
and
fizzy
really
horrible
will
actively
avoid
surprised
its
not
worsereviewed
on
ba
im
actually
slightly
torn
about
this
beer
since
it
often
provided
a
respite
in
95f
heat
and
95
humidity
in
singapore
and
malaysia
from
the
solid
but
thick
guinness
export
8
and
the
less
thick
and
less
solid
danish
royal
stout
8
in
malaysia
on
dutyfree
langkawi
island
its
a
mere
usd0
50
per
can
and
the
standard
swill
in
these
countries
truly
isnt
worth
paying
for
including
normal
carlsberg
tiger
isnt
fit
to
wash
sidewalks
with
drinkability
for
all
its
faults
this
beer
is
not
all
that
difficult
to
drink
salty
snacks
make
it
all
the
more
palatable
if
youre
just
looking
to
get
drunk
quickly
this
is
a
fairly
safe
and
inexpensive
avenue
to
do
so
other
comments
the
bottle
advises
that
it
be
served
extra
chilled
gee
cant
imagine
why
theres
even
a
colorchanging
thermometer
on
the
label
to
be
doubly
sure
that
you
get
it
cold
enough
so
thats
what
i
did
not
sure
i
would
want
to
try
it
at
the
warmer
temps
that
i
usually
prefer
when
reviewing
a
beer
honestly
the
alcohol
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
judge
this
on
any
other
criteria
but
you
see
the
numbers
theres
nothing
really
here
that
should
warrant
you
buying
this
beer
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
buy
a
bottle
of
bourbon
or
some
strong
belgian
ale
but
not
this
strong
lagers
have
long
been
on
my
list
of
beers
to
avoid
and
this
beer
merely
helped
me
make
that
decision
if
you
want
something
strong
these
types
are
not
the
way
to
go
at
all
ever
horribly
sweet
and
boring
i
cant
dig
this
at
all
nothing
that
special
about
it
really
too
much
alcohol
for
the
beer
give
this
a
miss
a
strong
lager
but
without
identity
or
complexity
tried
it
from
a
one
liter
can
it
creates
initially
a
gogg
head
but
it
disappears
rapidly
nose
is
weak
with
some
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
taste
is
straightforward
sweet
malt
taste
no
bitternes
or
complexity
not
a
very
recommendable
beer
unless
the
purpose
is
to
get
drunk
fast
pretty
bad
no
helping
this
one
haha
just
kidding
buddy
i
always
appreciate
trying
something
new
o
avoid
this
one
the
high
abv
does
not
redeem
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
poured
a
clear
pale
gold
very
pale
and
almost
watery
generates
a
finger
or
two
of
head
before
fading
to
nothing
light
lace
nose
is
sweet
malts
light
grain
mild
alcoholic
notes
apple
juice
a
weird
candied
note
develops
as
this
warms
taste
holds
more
malt
metallic
and
weird
fruits
notes
at
times
finishes
relatively
dry
and
mildly
alcoholic
on
the
tongue
but
burns
when
it
hits
the
throat
blegh
effect
is
amplified
as
it
warmed
thin
body
dry
and
a
weird
lingering
aftertaste
everything
got
worse
as
it
warmed
light
body
and
reasonable
mouth
feel
at
8
it
is
quite
an
easy
drinker
for
a
tall
cold
can
of
beer
i
would
take
this
over
a
big
factory
lager
anyday
not
a
great
beer
but
it
has
enough
in
it
to
make
it
ok
ditto
on
the
import
malt
liquor
comment
from
iron
jeffro
well
then
this
is
pretty
much
foreign
malt
liquor
same
as
we
have
here
yet
to
give
it
a
bit
of
credit
its
not
too
rough
around
the
edges
although
still
not
worth
revisiting
for
its
strength
its
evidently
but
not
overly
hot
otherwise
inoffensive
and
lots
of
drinkable
wowee
juice
for
your
hardearned
dollar
not
a
very
good
strong
lager
there
are
many
other
beers
of
this
strength
and
price
that
are
more
drinkable
d
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
brewerys
premium
lager
i
think
this
one
is
a
tad
better
but
still
im
not
too
impressed
i
was
surprised
by
the
floral
hoppiness
too
it
and
the
rich
fruit
flavours
but
it
is
decently
heavy
and
i
think
they
could
have
done
a
better
job
of
masking
the
alcohol
nevertheless
it
definitely
delivers
an
easy
buzz
for
your
buck
and
would
make
a
good
catchup
beer
bottom
line
too
watery
and
too
sweet
for
my
liking
so
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
any
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
so
unless
i
have
some
major
catching
up
to
do
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
one
again
d
best
buzz
for
the
buck
this
is
a
really
good
looking
lager
very
clean
looking
vicious
carbonation
nice
full
looking
head
and
nice
body
smell
is
very
much
of
corn
adjuncts
very
sweet
but
the
first
sip
is
really
surprisingly
hoppy
this
beer
is
much
more
bitter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
most
euro
lagers
tend
to
be
a
bit
too
much
on
the
malts
great
bite
on
the
tongue
smooth
going
down
it
sticks
in
the
throat
a
bit
but
man
it
hits
you
hard
and
fast
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
before
being
quite
buzzed
this
isnt
really
all
that
bad
though
im
surprised
okay
but
a
bit
overpowering
i
might
as
well
just
buy
the
premium
and
save
15
cents
but
rather
a
hangover
in
waiting
the
moral
of
this
story
before
you
buy
a
beer
take
a
look
at
the
list
of
ingredients
i
should
have
been
tipped
off
by
the
glucose
syrup
and
maize
as
to
the
quality
of
this
beer
faxe
sells
for
3
35
per
500
ml
a
premium
price
for
nonpremium
quality
for
getting
drunk
this
thing
will
do
the
trick
in
a
pinch
just
like
a
malt
liquor
in
the
states
and
like
a
malt
liquor
it
does
what
it
sets
out
to
do
very
well
sitting
here
buzzed
i
can
say
that
it
worked
outside
of
that
nothing
special
get
a
couple
of
regular
beers
to
achieve
the
same
effect
without
the
taste
quick
fading
slightly
off
white
head
settles
quickly
over
clear
gold
with
light
amber
highlights
sweet
sharpperfumy
nose
i
get
a
light
whiff
of
fruit
too
very
slight
adjuncty
note
taste
is
lightly
fruity
at
first
then
you
get
a
sharp
metallic
hop
attack
that
tastes
kinda
off
semi
full
bodied
lingering
sharpness
and
as
it
warms
you
get
some
adjunct
flavor
and
then
cheap
alcohol
ends
sharp
and
none
too
appealing
drink
it
cold
or
pass
lol
o
unless
you
find
pleasure
in
unpleasant
experiences
or
view
the
taste
of
urine
as
a
worthy
venture
i
would
advise
everyone
to
avoid
this
beer
i
have
to
be
honest
im
presently
drinking
a
500
ml
can
of
faxe
10
extra
strong
beer
that
i
won
in
a
bet
over
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
go
blackhawks
i
am
a
viking
at
heart
so
the
logos
kind
of
cool
i
like
the
color
as
it
resembles
someone
elses
clear
healthy
urine
specimen
on
the
nurses
station
counter
top
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
the
bed
pads
i
wash
in
the
long
term
care
facility
laundry
room
that
i
currently
work
in
so
it
is
familiar
and
quite
nutty
i
might
add
the
taste
is
somewhat
marmaladish
leaving
me
with
a
comforting
tingly
sensation
on
my
palate
satisfying
my
desire
for
the
bold
pungent
flavor
i
was
expecting
in
a
beer
of
this
strength
it
is
perfectly
carbonated
boasting
43
tiny
bubbles
no
44
theres
45
46
47
48
that
ascend
into
a
beautiful
2
finger
head
with
an
eyelet
lace
as
i
sip
again
i
am
noticing
something
else
i
think
it
is
a
hint
of
cabbage
or
perhaps
rhubarb
that
seems
to
settle
into
a
delightfully
smooth
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
i
actually
really
like
this
beer
and
dont
mind
the
intensity
as
it
becomes
closer
to
room
temperature
the
abv
is
high
but
the
price
is
low
3
35
so
it
is
perfect
for
anyone
who
wants
a
good
beer
buzz
early
in
the
morning
before
going
to
their
mcjob
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
definitely
drink
faxe
10
again
especially
knowing
that
i
only
need
one
can
to
forget
about
the
bad
day
i
may
have
had
washing
the
linens
in
a
nursing
home
ok
so
heres
the
bottom
of
the
can
last
drop
alrighty
then
there
you
have
it
faxe
10
is
ok
if
you
ask
me
now
im
ready
to
tuck
in
overall
an
assault
on
good
taste
could
barely
finish
14
of
it
before
drain
pouring
it
overall
a
decent
attempt
at
a
strong
lager
from
faxe
although
this
is
high
in
abv
it
was
quite
drinkable
could
be
better
balanced
but
decent
job
overall
not
too
crazy
about
this
one
but
it
was
good
to
try
worth
another
try
in
the
future
for
something
different
o
this
brings
me
back
to
my
high
school
days
of
drinking
old
english
before
the
dance
anything
to
get
a
buzz
on
with
no
care
for
taste
im
surprised
theres
a
customer
base
for
this
brew
because
its
terrible
what
a
fucking
mess
why
there
isnt
a
european
category
of
cheap
is
there
any
other
kind
malt
liquors
ill
never
know
overall
this
is
sickly
pandering
and
barely
less
than
gaginducing
a
whole
bloody
liter
of
this
dreck
is
way
more
than
wishful
thinking
my
danish
friends
i
respectfully
request
my
kroner
back
starts
with
bitterness
than
quickly
turns
into
the
taste
of
ethanol
all
i
taste
in
this
beer
is
alcohol
it
is
awful
not
going
to
finish
this
crap
blech
overall
i
dont
think
i
want
to
finish
this
liter
can
of
very
bad
beer
the
metallic
twang
is
quite
strong
and
the
adjunct
character
is
offputting
my
advice
this
is
one
for
lying
down
and
avoiding
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
wide
range
of
aromas
and
flavorings
for
such
a
strong
beer
it
provided
a
wide
range
of
grainy
flavors
to
work
with
among
these
there
was
a
surprising
ester
character
to
soften
up
the
beginning
while
a
more
biting
hop
presence
took
up
the
final
legs
this
is
a
perfect
beer
if
youre
wandering
around
the
streets
of
rome
looking
for
a
party
but
nothing
you
would
want
to
sit
back
with
and
relax
o
well
a
poor
product
unbalanced
i
guess
this
is
brewed
for
those
who
likes
to
get
drunk
at
a
low
cost
overall
unbalanced
artificial
watery
chemical
beer
dont
even
bother
to
try
o
this
is
probably
going
to
be
the
worst
rating
ive
ever
produced
on
this
site
avoid
this
stuff
at
all
costs
unless
you
like
pain
and
want
to
melt
your
mouth
and

drinkability
yes
i
am
a
college
student
and
as
any
good
student
i
do
enjoy
a
periodic
boozeup
but
even
if
i
was
very
well
intoxicated
and
this
was
all
that
there
was
i
wouldnt
drink
it
drain
pour
can
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
beer
with
a
quite
large
frothy
pure
white
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
alcoholic
phenols
with
some
grossly
sweet
adjunct
taste
is
also
dominated
by
grossly
sweetened
adjunct
with
some
very
apparent
alcohol
body
has
an
oily
texture
with
good
carbonation
i
wasnt
expected
much
but
this
is
a
lot
worse
then
i
had
expected
with
loads
of
alcohol
and
adjunct
easily
detectable
drain
pour
lets
face
it
this
is
a
vikings
drink
or
wanna
be
vikings
drink
from
the
appearance
of
the
can
you
know
your
in
for
it
its
scary
i
still
will
drink
faxe
extra
strong
just
because
im
cheap
and
for
3
15
at
the
beer
store
im
in
well
nothing
extra
in
this
beer
just
a
simple
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
ingredients
listed
water
malt
glucose
syrup
corn
and
finally
hops
this
is
the
ultimate
beer
for
a
cheap
buzz
get
one
down
and
its
smooth
sailing
lets
just
slam
the
ones
that
make
us
shart
overall
okay
but
not
great
i
would
expect
more
from
the
faxe
brewery
500ml
can
this
beer
serves
one
purpose
quick
intoxication
on
a
tight
budget
excellent
for
those
college
students
who
are
looking
for
just
that
however
for
a
beer
of
higher
abv
it
remains
decently
drinkable
and
does
make
an
excellent
night
cap
all
in
all
great
fro
college
students
decent
as
a
single
serving
night
closer
its
malt
liquor
from
europe
so
its
classy
malt
liquor
light
yellow
with
a
small
amount
of
head
that
quickly
disappears
smell
reminded
me
of
cheap
wine
oddly
sweet
i
guess
its
malty
sweet
but
ive
never
detected
malts
that
were
so
winelike
alcohol
smell
as
well
like
one
would
find
in
cheap
wine
taste
wasnt
too
bad
very
sweet
but
not
sickly
sweet
slight
metallic
twang
as
well
mouthfeel
was
oddly
enough
very
smooth
slight
bitter
aftertaste
more
from
the
alcohol
than
any
hops
used
if
any
hops
were
used
at
all
its
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
ive
had
but
its
still
malt
liquor
cheap
high
alcohol
beer
meant
to
get
you
drunk
not
meant
to
be
enjoyed
to
be
honest
im
afraid
to
try
this
beer
again
worst
beer
ever
a
can
or
two
of
this
can
get
you
a
really
good
buzz
which
is
probably
the
only
reason
to
drink
it
if
your
looking
to
get
super
drunk
super
fast
then
i
would
recommend
this
otherwise
why
not
get
some
fine
scotch
pours
a
thick
amber
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
strongly
of
alcohol
grain
and
hops
the
taste
is
rather
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
and
is
quite
bitter
the
beer
is
sticky
in
the
mouth
and
difficult
to
drink
which
is
probably
good
because
i
had
a
decent
buzz
after
finishing
the
pint
more
than
two
or
three
of
these
and
id
be
pretty
loaded
which
is
pretty
much
the
point
i
think
and
the
reason
that
my
college
town
liquor
store
has
so
much
in
stock
this
brew
is
only
worth
buying
if
you
want
to
get
wasted
and
want
a
beer
that
im
sure
has
just
been
mixed
with
wood
alcohol
minimum
aroma
and
flavour
raw
hard
alcohol
mouth
feel
no
sublety
no
dimension
and
not
even
really
much
of
a
skullcrusher
when
its
all
said
and
done
drinkability
quite
strange
for
a
beer
ok
thats
a
strong
lager
but
its
like
an
alcohoolic
soda
it
could
be
ok
to
get
loaded
fast
but
for
quality
drinking
i
would
choose
something
else
in
the
strong
beers
category
it
seems
that
unibroue
products
are
much
better
thanks
to
trbeer
for
this
one
no
seriously
well
its
not
terrible
but
not
exactly
great
either
a
definite
vegetable
flavor
mixed
with
the
higher
alcohol
if
i
was
looking
for
super
malt
liquor
this
might
be
it
but
other
than
that
i
tried
it
but
seriously
doubt
id
look
for
this
again
well
at
least
i
didnt
have
to
support
the
evil
carlsburg
empire
to
get
a
review
from
denmark
pours
an
attractive
clear
amber
with
a
rapidly
dissipating
white
head
aroma
of
hops
and
whoa
too
much
alcohol
taste
was
very
strong
bitter
nasty
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
stingy
and
awkward
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
but
now
i
dont
know
i
think
they
changed
it
this
brew
has
degraded
into
a
choke
it
down
and
get
drunk
fast
beer
what
a
shame
this
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
deep
gold
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
streaks
strangely
i
only
saw
about
five
bubble
while
looking
into
the
glass
for
a
while
maybe
i
got
a
poorly
packaged
can
the
smell
is
of
caustic
overwhelming
alcohol
and
some
slight
saltyness
the
taste
begins
with
a
massive
hit
of
alcohol
fire
then
trails
of
into
some
alcohol
spicyness
and
german
malts
the
hops
are
very
weak
and
only
detectable
in
their
bittering
potential
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nasty
it
makes
me
think
of
an
aluminum
aged
beer
for
some
reason
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
though
this
beer
is
pretty
cheap
though
i
think
kasteel
brune
is
still
a
little
cheaper
and
a
far
better
beer
its
subpar
though
strong
one
would
expect
something
boasting
a
10
abv
to
have
the
appearance
other
than
that
of
budweiser
sadly
such
is
not
the
case
from
this
brew
from
denmark
it
poured
a
clear
fizzy
yellow
in
color
with
a
crackling
shortlived
white
head
aromas
are
sweet
not
a
malty
sweet
but
a
candy
factory
sweetness
flavor
is
nasty
a
grainycorny
front
that
is
quickly
shoved
aside
by
a
sickly
sweetness
that
gets
worse
as
it
warmed
up
finishes
with
a
most
unpleasant
alcohol
burn
much
like
wood
feels
when
paint
remover
is
applied
to
it
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
virtually
no
drinkability
on
the
plus
side
ive
now
tried
a
beer
from
denmark
yaaaughhhhashuuhhhg
muuuwaaghrg
gakkk
now
to
fill
the
75
character
requirement
is
a
rendition
of
the
london
philharmonics
last
rendering
of
mozarts
salzberg
jam
at
the
yakking
bird
as
transposed
for
the
hummer
yaaaammmm
da
da
da
yas
hummm
yackghtchhhh
and
yes
as
long
as
you
ask
i
did
pour
it
down
the
sink
after
only
3
hits
corn
doesnt
even
taste
this
bad
in
shine
pours
a
pale
sick
yellow
colour
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissapates
into
a
skeleton
of
itself
smells
like
corn
cut
grass
musty
urine
oh
what
a
plus
ha
ha
has
a
slick
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
the
taste
is
one
of
high
alcohol
and
horrible
syrupy
badness
its
a
bit
like
a
medicine
i
could
detect
a
faint
grape
tart
to
it
this
beer
is
very
sticky
no
thanks
a
pretty
pour
with
a
high
abv
that
you
can
definetly
taste
this
is
a
brew
that
opens
your
eyes
and
is
not
for
the
timid
unfortunately
is
not
for
me
either
wrap
a
brown
paper
bag
around
this
one
another
flavorful
but
powerful
extra
strong
lager
from
denmark
tasty
and
refreshing
with
no
objectionable
after
tastes
or
smells
this
beer
starts
off
with
a
great
look
and
smell
however
it
quickly
loses
it
appeal
after
the
first
few
sips
i
found
it
better
than
the
average
reviews
a
strong
beer
that
doesnt
warn
you
about
its
strength
i
found
it
funny
far
from
my
favourite
but
overall
an
interesting
beer
une
bière
sans
personnalité
dont
lunique
intérêt
serait
le
haut
degré

mais
largument
ne
convaincra
que
les
alcooliques
car
pour
le
reste

est
totalement
déséquilibrée
trop
de
sucres
residuels
un
goût
désagréable
et
un
arrièregoût
carrement
infect
a
éviter
agreed
tastes
like
a
crappy
lager
with
a
shot
of
vodka
thrown
in
to
make
it
stronger
will
not
buy
again
purchased
at
ipercoop
in
italy
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
drank
and
a
rare
drainpour
after
the
review
of
course
even
now
it
curdles
the
stomach
an
abomination
o
its
quite
obvious
what
i
think
abuot
drinkabilty
complexity
and
so
on
half
of
the
bottle
was
a
drainpour
congratulations
du
demon
you
are
my
new
lowest
rated
beer
overall
i
normally
do
not
like
to
bash
a
brew
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
unbalanced
beers
i
have
ever
had
take
an
average
euro
pale
lager
and
dump
a
double
shot
of
100
proof
vodka
into
it
before
taking
a
sip
you
will
end
up
with
this
beer
even
if
you
just
want
to
get
drunk
there
are
better
options
i
honestly
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
o
12
alc
is
its
most
intersting
feature
the
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
that
come
through
do
not
impress
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
look
it
had
a
nice
color
with
a
good
froth
and
head
over
it
the
aromas
and
corresponding
taste
were
borderline
offensive
as
it
warms
these
actually
even
out
a
bit
and
the
maladies
subside
temporarily
the
abv
is
over
the
top
and
is
not
hidden
well
they
should
reevaluate
the
recipe
and
then
worry
about
making
something
more
over
the
top
nose
quite
fresh
and
sweet
slightly
relieved
by
sugar
alcohol
mouth
syrupy
sweet
enough
to
taste
but
with
a
touch
of
warmth
without
doubt
due
to
alcohol
also
sweet
it
feels
a
little
orange
syrup
aftertaste
it
can
quickly
become
sickening
but
for
beer
to
12
it
does
not
really
and
can
be
drunk
easily
a
good
point
in
that
direction
but
one
bad
point
for
the
few
flavors
available
and
a
sickening
body
quickly
such
as
a
poor
quality
alcohol
had
this
in
barcelpona
with
maria
and
zacca
poured
with
a
decent
off
white
foamy
frothy
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
was
a
clear
amber
aroma
was
malty
honey
with
a
hint
of
skunk
flavor
was
dominated
by
heavy
sweet
alcohol
body
wasnkt
bad
finish
is
the
same
as
flavor
way
too
sweet
and
boozy
one
was
more
than
enough
thank
you
you
know
those
flavoured
water
drinks
theyre
just
water
with
the
essence
of
strawberry
or
essence
of
orange
or
some
kind
of
fruit
well
this
beer
is
like
that
except
it
tastes
like
vodka
with
the
essence
of
beer
awful
just
awful
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
french
bière
de
garde
too
strong
if
i
had
no
tastebuds
and
wanted
to
get
drunk
i
still
wouldnt
choose
this
beer
the
headache
it
would
surely
produce
could
be
really
heavy
a
real
cracker
i
am
also
positive
there
would
be
demons
in
your
nighmares
ajh
i
almost
could
not
get
to
end
of
the
bottle
definitely
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
tried
im
usually
a
fan
of
strong
beers
but
this
one
really
misses
the
mark
its
a
stron
brew
alright
but
it
lacks
the
flavor
and
complexity
that
i
find
engaging
in
other
strong
beers
its
pale
and
limp
with
a
s
fair
clarity
the
smell
leaves
little
to
describe
except
for
some
ethanol
and
a
bit
of
grain
the
flavor
is
a
bit
harsh
but
under
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
little
bitter
hops
the
beer
is
of
medium
body
and
fairly
low
carbonation
this
brew
didnt
excite
me
at
all
smell
wheres
the
smell
apart
of
detergents
with
pine
or
lemon
or
whater
aroma
they
had
nothing
flavor
only
alcohol
mouth
is
again
alcohol
though
i
can
even
notice
something
hot
kind
of
pepper
and
thats
all
its
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
i
find
it
just
artificial
and
not
much
interesting
unless
you
want
to
get
drunk
quickly
and
even
if
thats
the
case
i
wouldnt
take
more
than
one
or
two
before
going
to
a
lighter
one
33cl
bottle
this
one
pours
an
absolutely
clear
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
on
it
the
head
drops
off
rather
quickly
despite
some
fizziness
the
aroma
is
thinner
with
some
fruit
and
alcohol
notes
some
malty
smell
also
the
taste
is
rather
harsh
although
somewhat
sweet
there
is
also
alcohol
up
front
some
malt
notes
overall
this
is
not
offensive
but
not
very
good
either
i
feel
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
brew
is
to
get
you
trashed
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
an
everyday
beer
but
it
is
really
not
that
bad
and
interesting
to
see
how
these
brewers
whose
other
beers
i
admire
quite
a
lot
managed
to
come
up
with
a
drinkable
12
offering
thats
really
impressive
and
i
think
one
should
at
least
try
it
to
see
how
masterfully
this
was
done
maybe
another
10
sht
basically
a
malt
liquor
gone
too
far
tastes
like
someone
brewed
a
standard
lager
recipe
then
added
6kilos
of
spray
malt
just
to
up
the
alcohol
content
stay
far
away
from
this
one
a
neat
looking
label
hesitant
because
of
previous
things
id
heard
about
this
one
but
gave
it
a
fair
objective
shot
and
was
pleasantly
not
poisoned
while
far
from
anything
of
quality
it
managed
to
keep
itself
well
beyond
the
realm
of
underthesink
cleaning
products
alcohol
at
an
alarming
12
stayed
surprisingly
hidden
or
at
least
nondestructive
to
the
beer
its
real
shortcoming
would
fall
in
a
simple
lack
of
taste
and
aroma
an
acceptable
draft
at
the
style
but
lacking
in
the
finer
touches
flavour
offers
little
interest
or
complexity
equally
can
be
said
for
the
aroma
both
present
but
void
it
managed
to
produce
some
head
over
the
clouded
unhealthy
looking
yellow
appearance
in
the
end
i
can
say
with
some
truth
that
i
didnt
mind
this
one
well
in
all
honesty
ive
had
worse
anyhow
drinkability
if
youre
a
hobo5
if
youre
a
ba1
the
beer
itself
is
a
deep
golden
brown
color
with
low
carbonation
and
a
poorly
retained
head
of
off
white
the
smell
is
of
corn
syrup
and
grain
alcohol
the
taste
is
of
a
very
thick
malt
base
without
nuance
or
flavor
tastes
like
an
overblown
bock
with
some
raw
vodka
or
some
other
distilled
spirit
added
mouthfeel
is
sometimes
cloying
and
thoroughly
dissatisfying
drinkability
i
dont
know
for
being
a
get
drunk
beer
this
is
obviously
its
only
purpose
as
the
taste
will
attest
youd
think
theyd
put
it
in
a
can
the
little
8
ounce
bottle
should
not
fool
you
into
thinking
that
youve
bought
something
decent
really
quite
bad
ok
heres
my
story
i
was
in
florence
italy
last
spring
without
a
clue
on
how
to
find
any
decent
italian
beer
and
i
ran
across
this
in
a
convenience
store
i
didnt
have
my
reading
glasses
and
the
label
looked
interesting
when
i
got
back
to
the
hotel
i
finally
was
able
to
read
12
abv
and
i
knew
i
was
in
trouble
with
this
one
8
months
later
i
fianlly
get
the
nerve
to
try
it
i
should
have
left
it
in
the
hotel
room
this
is
only
8
ounces
and
its
about
6
ounces
too
many
it
looked
like
a
slightly
dark
version
of
bmc
had
little
or
no
aroma
but
its
all
about
the
flavor
the
vodkarocket
fuel
flavor
that
burned
my
mouth
on
the
way
down
my
nonbeer
drinking
friend
took
a
sip
after
i
warned
her
and
its
a
good
thing
shes
still
my
friend
i
think
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
because
it
isnt
beer
no
matter
how
they
made
it
the
only
reason
i
see
for
this
beer
is
as
a
quick
way
to
get
drunk
no
thank
you
oh
my
i
remember
that
beer
from
many
many
years
ago
the
color
wasnt
very
distinct
at
all
but
i
do
remember
how
it
felt
it
was
an
attrocious
experience
i
took
that
beer
one
evening
before
going
out
poored
it
smelled
very
alcoholic
tasted
mettalic
strong
so
strong
it
had
no
taste
and
it
was
at
the
good
temperature
it
was
like
having
a
beer
strong
alcohol
shooter
at
once
there
many
beer
with
12
that
are
sweet
but
this
one
wasnt
it
gave
me
stomachaches
for
the
rest
of
the
day
ok
have
to
ad
some
words
to
make
this
review
this
is
awful
danger
will
robinson
golden
yellowish
color
with
a
white
head
that
does
not
last
and
all
traces
of
lace
vanish
the
smell
is
all
alcohol
and
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
strong
beer
i
like
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
nose
but
this
is
overpowering
with
no
other
real
characteristics
the
french
gave
this
kind
of
a
thick
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
a
burn
on
the
throat
i
paid
5
for
three
8oz
bottles
definitely
not
worth
it
when
i
can
buy
tennents
strong
lager
for
half
of
that
if
the
mood
for
a
quick
buzz
arises
i
will
probably
never
buy
this
beer
again
not
impressed
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
years
all
alcohol
12
and
no
taste
of
any
kind
but
alcohol
id
be
crazy
to
put
this
product
on
the
market
if
i
were
the
brewer
this
beer
is
the
same
name
as
a
one
brewed
in
france
however
this
bottle
has
brasserie
boxer
lausanne
suisse
printed
on
it
anyway
strong
alcohol
taste
brewer
claims
it
to
be
the
strongest
blonde
in
the
world
good
carbonation
strong
malty
after
taste
bought
in
rome
italy
o
the
fine
country
of
lithuania
has
some
work
to
do
on
this
one
m
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
upfront
and
fusel
in
the
rear
its
a
mouthful
damned
lietvak
pale
lagers
the
spices
are
nices
the
booze
i
cant
use
the
mouth
is
enhanced
with
very
strong
carbonation
there
is
nothing
to
recommend
abut
this
beer
sorry
but
it
is
a
drain
pour
following
the
crack
glug
i
was
looking
at
a
finger
of
eggnogcolored
head
with
very
good
retention
the
beers
color
was
a
hazy
orangishamber
the
nose
was
honeysweet
actually
very
pleasant
i
took
a
trepidatious
first
sip
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
honeylike
sweetness
on
the
tongue
a
greater
mouthful
resulted
in
a
feeling
of
high
heat
on
the
palate
revealing
its
intensity
and
giving
truth
to
its
extra
strong
beer
label
phew
fusel
was
the
word
this
was
the
stuff
that
gives
the
canquest
tm
its
legendary
status
true
questers
do
not
drainpour
although
this
was
a
worthy
candidate
a
clue
as
to
its
unpleasantness
comes
from
its
french
verbiage
biere
extra
forte
fortified
alcohol
is
the
stuff
of
hangovers
extra
fortified
extra
dry
extraintense
hangover
omfg
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
i
just
tasted
sugar
on
the
tongue
this
was
evil
i
am
sure
that
it
topped
out
at
9
5
because
they
aborted
the
mission
it
could
have
been
much
dryer
and
much
higher
in
abv
oof
finish
was
deadly
sweet
with
a
cloying
sugary
taste
that
cried
out
for
a
glass
of
water
im
dyin
is
gubernija
grand
95
the
same
beer
as
zhiguly
grand
hard
to
say
but
my
scores
are
strikingly
similar
this
beer
is
only
recommended
if
you
have
an
unnatural
affinity
for
boozy
highoctane
euro
lagers
one
more
thing
keep
away
from
open
flames
thanks
to
resi
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
like
the
smell
alcohol
up
front
some
malts
a
bit
sweet
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
is
ok
even
though
i
did
not
finish
the
whole
tall
boy
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
cream
colored
head
that
fades
to
soap
bubbles
then
to
almost
none
no
lace
aroma
is
malt
caramel
grain
sweet
flavor
is
like
nose
but
very
sweet
a
little
hop
bitter
in
there
plus
a
bit
of
tang
from
the
co2
also
solvents
body
is
a
full
and
heavy
carbonation
seems
a
bit
fizzy
finish
is
sweet
and
thankfully
not
too
long
a
few
swallows
is
all
i
want
the
rest
to
the
drain
out
of
a
can
this
is
at
least
ok
pleased
with
this
beer
found
it
in
a
liquor
store
near
ohare
that
must
have
been
run
by
some
people
from
eastern
europe
because
they
had
lots
of
polish
czech
lithuanian
beers
golden
to
orange
in
color
probably
the
orangest
beer
ive
ever
seen
corn
groats
and
hop
extract
are
new
ingredients
to
me
pretty
flavorful
i
had
no
idea
lithuania
made
such
a
product
similar
to
a
tripel
in
flavor
but
priced
much
more
economically
and
not
really
up
to
belgian
standards
definitely
my
go
to
lithuanian
beer
and
although
it
seems
like
it
is
just
styled
to
produce
high
alcohol
it
does
have
a
unique
taste
not
much
after
taste
but
not
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
either
d
if
youre
wanting
to
drink
something
with
the
full
intention
of
getting
drunk
this
will
do
it
im
starting
to
feel
it
already
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
it
grows
on
me
however
after
one
can
id
be
more
than
happy
to
be
done
with
this
one
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
but
its
not
the
absolute
worst
beer
ive
had
but
its
by
far
not
amongst
the
best
tasted
like
it
smelled
pretty
harsh
the
alchohol
is
not
hidden
at
all
i
started
drinking
these
out
of
the
can
after
a
while
just
so
i
could
get
drunk
so
it
would
tast
better
stay
away
from
this
beer
d
i
think
that
what
this
is
is
essentially
malt
liquor
for
the
ghettos
of
lithuania
and
the
baltic
nations
this
is
boozy
heavy
sugary
sweet
and
hopped
like
a
czech
pils
this
is
a
pretty
dagnasty
brew
that
id
never
buy
again
terrible
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
after
2
drinks
i
had
to
make
sure
what
i
first
tasted
was
really
that
bad
serving
type
plastic
bottle
pored
into
a
goblet
it
appears
that
i
have
stumbled
upon
a
lithuanian
malt
likka
hmmm
this
one
is
not
good
but
it
is
interesting
the
beer
pours
a
mediumdark
golden
yellow
into
my
pils
glass
with
a
foamy
head
that
soon
becomes
a
thin
film
there
is
a
constant
powerful
carbonation
and
the
beer
leaves
minimal
lacing
aroma
well
its
a
strong
mix
of
sweet
malts
alcohol
and
skunkiness
not
too
repulsive
but
not
inviting
either
the
flavor
is
like
nothing
i
have
ever
tasted
you
can
tell
right
away
that
this
strong
lager
isnt
brewed
to
impress
rather
it
is
there
to
gey
yer
swerve
on
very
sweet
and
skunky
there
is
an
underlying
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
bad
candy
the
strong
alcohol
content
makes
itself
known
yet
it
isnt
overpowering
thin
sticky
mouthfeel
accompanied
by
a
finish
that
makes
me
wonder
if
i
just
did
a
shot
of
liquor
one
and
out
for
me
on
this
brew
halfway
down
the
glass
and
my
stomach
is
starting
to
punch
out
at
me
in
protest
wondering
what
the
heck
is
going
on
and
what
did
it
ever
do
to
deserve
this
best
to
make
this
a
sink
pour
rather
than
find
out
what
its
like
the
second
time
around
on
the
way
back
up
this
strong
lager
pours
an
attractive
pale
golden
sheen
with
a
healthy
amount
of
frothy
soapy
white
head
the
head
melts
away
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
a
ring
around
the
glass
there
is
a
very
grainy
saltinecracker
aroma
with
a
little
malt
consistent
for
eastern
euro
lagers
the
flavor
the
glycerine
mouthfeel
almost
overpowers
anything
else
representing
flavor
that
may
be
there
i
had
an
involuntary
shake
of
my
head
after
my
first
swig
good
grief
after
a
few
more
inadvisable
sips
that
initial
shock
wore
off
and
i
could
sense
some
malt
more
of
that
soup
cracker
essence
the
alcohol
is
while
not
overtly
influential
on
the
flavor
very
present
in
the
weight
and
finish
of
this
beer
i
have
to
say
this
beer
got
mildly
tolerable
as
i
masochistically
finished
it
the
alcohol
in
all
likelihood
having
a
big
part
in
that
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
for
the
wrong
reasons
d
i
hope
it
doesnt
kill
the
plants
d
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
you
really
cannot
taste
the
abv
and
it
has
some
decent
flavor
not
something
i
would
reach
for
again
but
a
halfway
pleasant
suprise
very
light
gold
pour
with
light
cornadjunct
sweetness
and
a
big
alcohol
smell
taste
is
malty
strong
alcohol
taste
gets
more
like
rubbing
alcohol
and
very
harsh
as
you
drink
it
this
is
terrible
but
what
do
you
expect
for
99
for
16
9
oz
the
9
5
alcohol
tastes
like
double
that
dont
bother
with
this
beer
unless
you
like
high
alcohol
fusel
alcohol
bombs
then
youd
like
this
drinkability
this
one
is
not
for
me
too
much
like
malt
liquor
for
my
book
i
purchased
this
bottle
at
a
local
fruit
market
that
doesnt
usually
carry
beer
at
99
cents
a
bottle
and
9
5
abv
i
figured
i
was
getting
some
bang
for
my
buck
if
anything
this
is
a
decent
lager
with
a
sweet
alcohol
kickburn
the
appearance
is
fine
amber
light
headand
moderate
carbonation
the
taste
is
sweet
warm
crisp
slight
corn
and
grass
notes
the
alcohol
does
not
overpower
though
if
this
wasnt
so
strong
i
could
see
this
as
a
decent
choice
for
a
session
beer
but
given
the
strength
id
say
this
is
a
novelty
maybe
good
as
a
warmer
for
a
cool
fall
night
slight
recommendation
interesting
but
i
would
not
do
it
again
throw
in
a
bunch
more
hops
and
you
might
have
something
considering
the
abv
and
how
sweet
it
tastes
the
og
must
be
ridiculous
pours
a
hazy
golden
bubbly
white
head
rises
to
the
top
of
the
glass
then
quickly
settles
down
no
lacing
no
retention
at
all
smell
is
very
sweet
alcohol
corn
citrus
almost
a
floral
hoppiness
to
it
not
bad
for
what
it
is
taste
is
very
strong
lots
of
caramel
and
alcohol
grassy
herbal
hopping
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
close
to
flat
interesting
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
the
really
low
carbonation
is
kind
of
a
curveball
drain
cleaner
a
sullied
appearance
i
wonder
if
its
filtered
from
a
glance
it
would
seem
there
was
stuff
floating
in
it
a
soap
scum
for
a
head
a
very
sweet
aroma
sugary
and
toxic
with
the
alcohol
not
too
well
hidden
by
any
means
a
little
bit
of
caramel
like
lace
in
there
too
its
not
offensive
by
any
means
the
flavour
likewise
stays
quite
neutral
despite
a
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
this
has
enough
flavour
to
avoid
the
taste
of
a
typical
high
octane
malt
liquor
it
comes
across
more
as
a
poorly
made
belgian
strong
or
something
i
could
come
nowhere
near
close
to
finishing
the
can
myself
or
even
with
two
friends
but
it
was
far
better
than
i
expected
it
avoids
the
realm
of
awful
which
is
all
you
can
ask
from
a
lithuanian
malt
liquor
i
guess
this
is
schlitz
on
steroids
pours
out
looking
like
strong
urine
frmo
a
dehydrated
person
there
is
no
head
and
if
i
take
the
patience
to
stare
at
the
beer
ill
get
a
rare
bubble
popping
up
every
now
and
then
smell
is
big
on
grain
alcohol
and
a
weird
fruitiness
all
of
this
is
echoed
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
a
presence
of
artificial
banana
flavor
and
medicinal
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
oily
sickly
and
sticky
not
terribly
drinkable
watery
mediumlight
body
cloying
sweetness
and
not
so
pleasant
high
alcohol
content
make
this
a
brew
that
i
cannot
recommend
nor
spend
the
money
on
again
to
be
more
honest
for
the
site
i
may
come
back
and
try
to
judge
this
beer
as
compared
to
other
malt
liquors
but
i
also
in
the
interest
of
good
craft
beer
dont
feel
that
bad
about
skewing
a
beer
like
this
towards
the
bad
end
of
the
site
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
big
airy
champagne
head
that
dies
quickly
all
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
mostly
hoppy
with
a
little
grass
and
some
yeasty
sough
dough
bread
twang
sweetness
balances
it
out
but
it
is
a
dull
characterless
sweetness
highly
alcoholic
and
no
effort
to
hide
it
thin
body
and
a
viscous
mouth
leaving
a
palate
coating
thats
not
in
its
best
interest
id
rather
it
just
left
me
alone
after
swallowed
as
it
warms
the
slim
characters
presented
at
the
beginning
start
to
meld
together
but
at
the
same
time
losses
carbonation
which
was
a
redeeming
quality
i
dont
think
ill
be
pining
for
another
one
of
these
soon
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
i
guess
its
a
okay
pours
golden
not
much
head
and
no
lacing
good
amount
of
bubbles
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
alcohol
is
evident
body
is
light
to
medium
and
carbonated
taste
is
sweetand
strong
thick
like
a
doppel
even
though
body
is
not
at
9
5
you
could
not
have
more
that
one
or
twoand
goodnight
drinkability
i
would
rate
as
decent
i
havent
quite
decided
about
this
one
yet
not
bad
drinkability
not
bad
for
what
it
is
feel
no
need
to
try
another
but
considering
so
its
the
latter
of
my
first
statement
when
i
saw
this
i
thought
to
myself
wow
a
9
5
abv
for
99
cents
took
it
home
chilled
it
opened
it
poured
it
aroma
how
do
you
decripe
some
of
this
calibur
i
think
i
got
some
malt
but
not
to
sure
musty
taste
that
alcohol
i
have
had
that
someplace
before
had
to
think
about
it
for
a
while
than
it
came
to
me
when
i
was
in
vietnam
had
some
local
stuff
i
think
it
was
formaldehyde
based
i
am
glad
i
only
paid
99
for
this
okay
so
zhiguly
is
a
lightbodied
highalcohol
lager
from
lithuania
all
that
doesnt
exactly
set
expectations
too
high
but
for
1
35
id
say
its
worth
picking
one
up
just
for
the
hell
of
it
if
nothing
else
you
can
catch
a
cheap
buzz
zhiguly
grand
is
honey
colored
with
a
large
frothy
head
however
the
retention
is
weak
the
aroma
is
strong
and
sweet
similar
to
a
good
malt
liquor
but
without
those
adjunct
smells
the
taste
has
a
strong
thick
lager
flavor
sweetness
is
rich
and
honeylike
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
the
malt
flavor
is
tempered
by
mildly
herbal
hops
and
an
alcohol
bite
which
increases
as
the
beer
warms
up
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
9
5
lager
i
really
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
but
its
not
bad
cheap
for
a
strong
import
but
once
youve
tried
it
time
to
move
on
opinion
well
i
have
been
trying
a
lot
of
the
cheaper
baltic
brews
here
lately
and
this
is
probably
the
best
one
yet
is
that
saying
anything
maybe
i
dont
find
it
completely
objectionable
and
perhaps
this
is
because
they
used
some
hops
in
it
it
would
be
nicer
if
there
was
a
more
assertive
bittering
component
but
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
overall
stick
it
in
a
brown
paper
bag
and
this
is
probably
a
hit
on
the
park
bench
with
your
dosser
mates
but
it
is
not
for
my
fridge
again
drinkability
hmmm
this
is
a
tough
one
for
what
it
is
its
fairly
well
done
there
are
worse
americanbrewed
malt
liquors
out
there
with
less
alcohol
so
i
guess
that
says
it
all
nice
label
too
taste
was
pretty
good
considering
that
there
was
little
head
and
not
very
much
bitterness
there
was
some
fruitiness
that
i
detected
which
complimented
and
hid
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
in
this
beer
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
the
standard
macros
id
actually
pick
this
over
heineken
and
the
like
interesting
beverage
here
from
lithuania
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
high
carbonation
amounting
in
a

nice

aroma
with
a

hint
to

has
a
slight
cidery
aroma
as
it
warms
taste
is
sugary

and
a

aftertaste
this
is
really

hides

well
not

id
drink
everyday
but
worth
a

good

emerge
from

gathered
in
by
the
deep

overripe

cream
and

almond
appear
as
well
on
the

it
is
sweetly
alcoholic
clean
and

with
a
respectably
long
bright
finish
flavors
of
apricots
pine
needles
aluminum
and
hay
appear
i
imagine
this
to
be
some
kind
of
eisbock
like
eku

a

detracts
however
coming
in
at
the
same
price
as
leffegrimbergen
and
almost
twice
as
much
as
better
lagers
means
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
o
the
taste
is
ok
but
the
rest
really
doesnt
stand
up
slight
hops
in
the
taste
malty
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
also
little
sweetness
to
it
better
than
i
expected
and
was
definitely
enjoyable
especially
in
the
hot
weather
very
satisfying
drink
with
a
knifesedge
balance
of
hoppy
bitterness
with
toasted
malt
to
great
effect
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
d
good

the
alcohol
content
is
not
to
terribly
high
this
beer
makes
me
imagine
what
a
high

stella
would
taste
like
more
flavor
bigger
character
a
bit
sweet
but
rather
well
balanced
worked
well
with
dark
meat
serving
bottle
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
drank
this
beer
with
out
a
plate
of
nachos
from
julios
burio
here
in
calgary
this
is
an
average
beer
thats
better
with
some
spicy
food
then
by
itself
d
had
this
one
for
2
nights
in
a
row
at
the
same
club
will
surely
drink
this
one
again
on
my
return
to
lleida
but
will
not
do
any
effort
to
find
this
beer
in
holland
d
a
very
nice
beer
paired
with
with
food
or
by
itself
perfect
with
tapas
has
some
good
stuff
here
but
not
the
right
stuff
cool
bottle
aside
this
prime
candidate
for
being
lightstruck
seems
to
have
had
its
ticket
punched
as
such
too
bad
since
i
remember
liking
this
a
lot
more
in
the
past
but
perhaps
it
was
really
the
heat
of
the
summer
day
and
the
longawaited
paella
the
bottle
is
intriguing
raised
text
for
the
ingredients
and
logos
but
is
unfortunately
green
which
can
cause
problems
though
this
bottle
does
not
seem
to
have
been
lightstruck
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
spanish
beers
available
and
as
the
most
expensive
6pack
for
sale
in
my
local
supermarket
costing
twice
as
much
as
a
6pack
of
heineken
it
damn
well
better
be
a
good
beer
i
will
probably
splurge
on
an
other
6
pack
of
this
but
im
in
no
hurry
to
do
so

so
could
be
the

i

well

and
a

made
this
a

departure
from

is
clearly
identifiable
and
no

of
skunk
even
though
green
bottle
had
to
travel
3000
miles
taste
is
quite
refreshing
with
very
fresh
and
crisp

easy
to
distinguish
from
a
pale

and
quite
refreshing
note
to
self
rated
4
euro
strong
lager
managed
to
get
a
single
of
this
at
my
local
recommended
by
the
cashier
whos
opinion
i
trust
i
like
the
embossed
green
bottle
it
comes
in
no
paper
label
on
it
whatsoever
large
frothy
white
head
on
the
initial
pour
with
a
fairly
impressive
head
retention
deep
golden
in
colour
with
an
amber
tint
to
it
good
carbonation
seen
through
a
clear
body
crisp
grainy
malt
almost
bready
with
herbal
hops
to
round
out
the
aroma
sweet
bready
malt
up
front
for
the
flavour
becoming
more
grainy
in
the
middle
and
finishing
with
a
bitter
somewhat
astringent
hop
character
a
full
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
rolls
over
the
palate
and
tongue
but
has
a
bit
of
a
caustic
texture
to
it
making
it
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
one
to
tip
back
and
chug
more
impressive
than
what
i
had
been
expecting
but
still
average
all
things
considered
the
higher
abv
makes
this
beer
taste
more
like
singha
than
becks
cool
find
o
a
very
standard
euro
strong
lager
if
i
would
rate
this
to
style
i
would
give
it
probably
a
mean
of
4
because
it
is
well
done
however
i
do
not
get
the
idea
of
making
such
a
strong
beer
with
the
limited
possibilities
to
balance
it
provided
by
a
pale
lager
this
style
is
not
for
me
and
i
am
definitely
not
going
back
to
this
alcohol
and
malt
nose
with
a
little
background
grains
the
mouth
is
in
the
style
of
the
rest
of
the
line
gordon
that
is
to
say
too
much
alcohol
so
the
other
flavors
if
any
of
course
are
completely
overshadowed
there
is
also
an
excessive
proportion
of
sugar
however
the
aftertaste
leaves
some
traces
of
peanuts
including
nuts
on
the
tongue
which
is
a
tad
on
the
level
of
the
beer
md
carbonation
is
fine
alcohol
is
to
much
in
your
face
very
good
i
see
all
bad
or
average
reviews
for
this
beer
which
makes
me
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
me
but
i
must
say
i
loved
this
beer
this
brew
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
negligible
head
its
aroma
is
very
faint
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
little
malt
and
grain
not
much
to
be
impressed
with
the
taste
is
intensely
sweet
with
a
serious
alcohol
warming
the
sweetness
is
not
maltlike
but
instead
has
a
somewhat
unpleasant
sugary
quality
its
a
little
cloying
but
not
quite
as
bad
as
the
extra
strong
eurolagers
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
hefty
with
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
not
bad
all
in
all
though
this
beer
is
not
worth
trying
extremely
disappointing
i
guess
this
is
a
beer
for
people
who
want
a
buzz
without
having
to
pee
a
lot
overall
an
interesting
beer
quite
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
disguised
on
the
down
side
it
is
too
sweet
almost
cloying
on
the
palate
interesting
brew
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
ill
be
racing
back
for
d
session
if
its
ontap
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
lager
style
too
strong
taste
is
a
bit
metalic
marzipan
alcoholic
well
balanced
but
with
some
artificial
flavour
body
is
lighter
than
it
used
to
be
another
one
i
remember
being
a
better
beer
some
years
ago
disappointing
had
this
brought
back
from
belgium
it
pours
a
deep
gold
color
with
a
mediumdensity
not
too
persistent
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
smells
a
bit
of
sour
apples
with
a
bit
of
pepper
tastes
of
bananas
hops
with
a
honey
finish
and
a
sour
aftertase
its
wellcarbonated
which
almost
doesnt
go
with
that
honey
and
oddly
although
it
tastes
of
honey
its
not
sweet
at
the
end
which
it
seems
it
certainly
should
be
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
definitely
thin
for
deep
undertones
the
taste
has
drinkable
ok
youd
probably
settle
into
the
flavor
after
a
couple
but
on
the
whole
i
think
id
go
with
something
like
duvel
instead
sadly
this
canned
product
was
a
total
letdown
my
two
beautiful
thistle
glasses
paid
for
years
ago
in
belgium
will
be
used
for
other
beers
i
will
not
be
trying
this
in
a
tinned
form
again
first
time
i
got
it
was
in
a
can
it
was
very
strong
and
awful
it
was
wheater
temperature
then
i
had
it
on
bottle
and
was
still
strong
and
hard
to
swallow
the
last
time
was
in
another
bottle
and
was
pretty
soft
maybe
the
training
changed
the
perception
the
colour
is
very
golden
but
something
orange
influences
the
final
appearance
the
foam
is
big
and
very
white
a
good
beer
im
satisfied
this
is
a
beer
that
at
10
seems
like
it
would
be
rough
and
hot
no
it
really
is
quite
a
sooth
ride
with
lots
of
malt
and
a
bright
finish
there
are
nunaces
to
this
beer
as
more
sips
are
taken
but
for
the
style
this
drinks
all
right
this
was
bought
in
the
uk
in
oct
2005

from

recommended
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
under
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
lingers
a
bit
and
leaves
a
few
spots
of
lace
the
nose
is
surprisingly
nice
with
malt
and
spicey
hops
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
quite
light
the
taste
disappoints
though
dominated
by
a
sickly
sweet
high
alcohl
taste
above
some
bready
malt
and
fairly
harsh
metallic
hops
a
dry
bitter
emerges
in
the
finish
and
lingers
long
into
the
aftertaste
the
brew
is
rough
around
the
edges
there
are
better
ways
to
get
the
alcohol
o
this
beer
opened
up
and
became
rubbing
alcohol
infused
lager
drain
pour
i
also
expected
a
nasty
metalic
headache
type
feel
to
the
aftertaste
this
didnt
happen
and
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
by
the
beer
in
general
sure
it
had
too
much
alcohol
for
my
tastes
but
it
told
me
that
on
the
tin
this
a
lot
better
than
many
in
this
class
or
style
honest
crest
super
is
super
disgusting
the
feeling
of
revulsion
actually
drinking
it
far
far
exceeds
the
feeling
of
embarrassment
i
had
buying
the
can
beginning
this
review
i
had
every
intention
of
poking
fun
at
the
destitute
downandout
types
that
make
up
crests
only
demographic
now
i
just
feel
sorry
for
them
in
all
seriousness
this
beer
for
all
its
flagrant
stomachwrenching
alcohol
is
actually
a
very
sobering
experience
drinkability
please
take
not
of
all
the
reviews
before
u
go
spending
your
hard
earned
dollar
on
this
beer
one
i
wont
finish
nor
will
i
ever
buy
again
final
verdict
i
would
drink
this
again
and
no
i
am
not
certifiably
insane

extremely

and
mix
with
some

that
is
pretty
disgusting
taste
is
almost
unbearable
due
to
the
highlevel
of

i
could
barely
drink
more
then
10
of
this
before
drain
pouring
the
while
thing
dont
bother
with
it
also
it
gives
one
a
wee
buzz
which
is
also
greatly
appreciiated
by
all
beer
drinkers
worldwide
very
little
aroma
faint
bit
of

alcohol
taste
initially
is
pretty

it
is
all
in
the
aftertaste
the
burn
shall
we
call
it
alcohol
burn
as
it
goes
down
your
throat
because
of
the
10
taste
is
metallic
and
sweet
if
thats
possible
its
one
of
those
beers
that
if
you
need
to
get
drunk
fast
you
pound
one
down
i
can
imagine
a
bunch
of
young
brits
throwing
one
back
before
going
out
much
like
americans
would
hit
the
schlitz
eric
jh
this
is
better
than
most
malt
liquors
but
only
that
it
hides
the
abv
a
little
better
still
to
be
avoided
unless
like
me
you
have
a
strange
nostalgia
for
cheap
strong
beer
drinkability
i
was
not
overly
fond
of
this
beer
it
just
seemed
to
have
nothing

head
lots
of
fizz
and
some
lacing
smell
is
very
alcoholic
not
good
at
all
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
alcohol
and
some
hints
of
adjunct
corn
i
think
it
is
this
is
some
really
rough
stuff
hard
going
down
not
very
drinkable
and
in
my
youth
i
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
a
few
too
many
of
these
which
resulted
in
a
two
day
hangover
avoid
this
body
is
medium
texture
is
smooth
and
its
relatively
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
ridiculously
high
abv
i
would
not
drink
too
much
though
it
has
hangover
written
all
over
it
i
tried
this
only
becuse
i
could
buy
one
to
taste
and
not
a
six
canned
beer
what
can
i
say
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
light
carbonation
overpowering
smell
of
alcohol
over
the
boiled
grains
taste
was
sweet
with
little
hop
evident
over
the
burn
of
the
alcohol
dry
finish
with
a
burn
to
it
this
is
one
rough
brew
like
green
beer
mixed
with
vodka
a
staple
of
confirmed
uk
rummies
no
doubt
look
for
these
discarded
crest
cans
where
ever
indiscriminate
alcoholics
gather
under
bridges
park
out
buildings
an
alleys
poured
this
out
of
a
500ml
blue
and
gold
coloured
can
10
super
strength
written
in
large
bold
gold
letters
around
the
bottom
half
how
this
can
still
remain
a
premium
lager
after
a
claim
like
that
boggles
my
mind
as
with
many
mistakes
of
my
past
this
stuff
looked
okay
in
the
beginning
was
a
husky
corn
gold
colour
clear
decent
head
that
leaves
some
mild
lacing
but
the
fun
stops
there
the
smell
is
a
faint
subdued
grainy
chemical
laced
affair
far
too
subdued
for
something
10
abv
what
could
be
lurking
under
that
well
id
describe
the
flavour
as
some
grain
and
corn
mixed
in
with
petroleum
very
very
boozy
taste
to
it
you
taste
the
booze
but
no
other
real
discernable
flavours
flavour
and
mouthfeel
blend
into
a
cidery
experience
the
intense
boozy
presence
gives
it
an
apple
vinegar
character
most
drinkable
perhaps
out
of
a
brown
paper
bag
and
with
that
shot
of
rye
in
there
to
make
it
more
palatable
malt
liquor
from
england
this
stuff
reminds
me
of
colt
45
on
here
its
labeled
as
an
old
ale
but
states
lager
on
the
can
poured
a
pale
gold
stain
colour
with
a
film
head
which
left
before
my
first
sip
lacing
was
sparse
on
the
glass
smelled
very
very
malty
i
can
almost
see
the
barley
through
my
nose
no
hops
detected
in
the
smell
nor
the
tongue
but
alot
of
malts
were
evident
very
bittersour
beer
not
bitter
from
hops
just
plain
bitter
left
a
parched
dry
mouthfeel
overall
undrinkable
and
disappointing
