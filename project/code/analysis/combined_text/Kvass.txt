NA
it
was
flat
upon
pouring
but
i
will
take
the
hit
on
that
i
shared
some
with
a
buddy
on
saturday
night
and
the
remainder
is
going
to
tone77
so
repeated
opening
and
closing
of
the
bottle
was
probably
a
contributor
it
is
not
that
anyone
in
my
circle
dislikes
kvass
per
se
but
it
can
be
very
filling
i
felt
like
i
had
eaten
a
loaf
of
rye
bread
by
the
time
we
finished
on
saturday
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
limited
light
penetration
nose
smelled
of
bready
chocolate
very
pleasant
indeed
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
flavor
was
unique
to
kvass
it
had
a
sort
of
milk
chocolatiness
but
along
with
a
rye
bite
not
exactly
sour
but
close
to
it
finish
was
semisweet
and
quite
tasty
i
can
understand
why
it
is
drank
as
a
thirst
quencher
and
also
why
so
many
of
us
only
need
a
half
a
glass
or
so
it
is
one
of
those
drinks
where
a
little
can
go
a
long
way
this
poured
out
as
a
root
beer
colored
beer
there
was
a
thin
quick
fading
head
no
lacing
or
retention
the
smell
is
earthy
with
some
dried
fruits
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
flat
side
not
as
much
bubble
as
i
was
hoping
for
overall
a
decent
kvass
overall
a
mediocre
kvass
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
less
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
carbonation
although
the
smell
is
good
and
it
mostly
has
the
right
balance
of
flavors
o
another
mediocre
kvass
wouldnt
have
this
again
with
all
of
that
said
it
shouldnt
be
surprising
that
nikola
is
a
wellmade
and
very
clean
mainstreamstyle
kvass
its
got
just
a
light
touch
of
carbonation
to
it
and
it
balances
its
darkmalt
molasses
breadiness
perfectly
leaving
it
flavorful
and
traditional
tasting
but
still
refreshing
theres
little
stickiness
left
behind
in
the
mouth
in
additional
versions
its
blended
with
fruit
juice
or
added
flavors
in
a
variety
of
flavors
pretty
average
kvass
at
best
typical
cola
brown
color
with
no
head
and
virtually
no
carbonation
in
this
case
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
really
helps
a
kvass
and
this
one
could
use
one
thin
sour
with
a
little
too
little
breadiness
and
too
much
fruitiness
as
well
as
a
somewhat
thin
metallic
finish
i
dont
really
care
for
this
particular
take
on
the
style
2
liter
plastic
bottle
best
by
date
of
150811
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
brew
pours
a
dark
ruby
redbrown
color
that
you
can
see
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
not
much
of
any
head
at
all
but
what
head
is
there
is
a
tan
color
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
is
very
sweet
it
smells
like
molasses
dark
bread
dark
fruit
and
some
toffee
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
dark
bread
molasses
cola
dark
fruit
raisins
and
some
caramel
like
the
aroma
it
tastes
very
sweet
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
thin
but
its
also
slick
with
low
carbonation
if
you
like
sweet
beers
then
youll
probably
like
this
not
a
bad
overall
brew
but
it
took
a
little
while
to
finish
the
bottle
myself
because
of
the
sweetness
worth
a
try
its
certainly
different
despite
the
best
by
date
of
next
year
it
smells
like
oxidation
wet
cardboard
and
sweet
caramelized
sugar
tastes
like
caramel
raisin
prune
juice
some
malty
presence
rye
bread
is
distinguishable
some
astringency
and
dry
in
the
finish
loses
carbonation
quickly
and
is
a
bit
too
sweet
in
general
fairly
easily
quaffed
like
soda
pretty
average
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
the
kvass
kick
moves
back
into
mother
russia
this
offering
pours
a
clear
amberruby
topped
by
some
tall
fizzy
ecru
foam
frankly
this
has
one
of
the
most
steadfast
heads
ive
yet
seen
on
a
kvass
despite
its
fizziness
the
nose
comprises
rye
toast
fennel
light
maple
syrup
pumpernickel
and
a
touch
of
burnt
caramel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
pumpernickel
smoky
toffee
caraway
seeds
black
pepper
and
rye
bread
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
lightly
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
feel
akin
to
jello
sliding
through
the
lips
shooterstyle
baby
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
plasticbottle
kvass
ive
encountered
so
far
but
the
nearly
slimy
feel
ruins
what
could
have
been
a
decent
drink
m
d
sparkling
and
even
dry
it
isnt
quite
as
refreshing
as
i
hoped
but
alright
id
wouldnt
reject
a
revisit
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
there
is
no
head
but
there
are
a
few
white
bubbles
on
the
surface
the
aroma
is
a
lot
of
sugar
along
with
bread
the
flavor
has
notes
of
rye
bread
raisins
honey
sugar
and
cocacola
a
person
i
was
drinking
the
beer
with
said
it
tasted
like
someone
poured
flat
cocacola
on
top
of
a
bowl
of
raisin
bran
i
agree
the
beer
is
very
sweet
low
carbonation
that
borders
on
being
flat
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
looking
tan
had
and
no
lacing
smell
is
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
molasses
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
rye
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
okay
carbonation
drinkability
is
on
the
lower
side
a
bit
cloying
and
quite
strange
overall
this
must
be
an
acquired
taste
im
just
confused
though
NA
NA
NA
NA
o
my
first
stab
at
this
style
its
like
a
malty
iced
tea
with
raisins
and
soft
carbonation
im
enjoying
it
but
i
imagine
it
could
get
sickening
in
larger
quantities
note
0
5l
plastic
bottle
overall
a
tasty
kvass
but
i
like
a
little
bit
more
effervescence
this
would
help
it
a
great
deal
i
think
pours
a
colalike
brown
with
a
bubbly
fizzy
tan
head
the
body
sits
a
fairly
still
dark
brown
with
no
lace
anywhere
the
nose
is
fairly
sweet
brown
sugar
rye
dark
malt
kind
of
a
pumpernicklebrown
bread
presence
on
the
palate
sugary
colalike
sweetness
with
rye
dark
malt
and
brown
bread
the
taste
is
a
little
offputting
at
first
think
carbonated
wort
the
feel
is
exactly
what
you
think
carbonated
wort
would
taste
like
sweet
sugary
malts
and
mild
carbonation
medium
body
and
syrup
i
think
this
bottle
was
a
little
old
as
the
carbonation
has
fallen
a
bit
this
was
worth
the
tick
but
probably
not
something
i
need
to
have
again
it
isnt
too
offensive
it
less
of
a
traditional
kvas
than
most
the
first
glass
disappeared
in
minutes
its
refreshing
if
nothing
else
but
sugary
pours
a
clear
darkish
iced
tea
color
with
a
fizzy
1
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
whatsoever
either
smell
is
of
rye
bread
raisins
grapes
figs
and
maybe
some
prunes
very
big
dark
dried
fruit
aromas
taste
is
of
bread
raisins
prunes
and
some
brown
sugar
to
boot
very
much
like
a
raisin
bread
in
liquid
form
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
to
be
quite
honest
pouring
this
out
was
quite
fizzy
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tiny
bit
flat
with
some
small
carbonation
bubbles
on
the
tongue
this
is
my
first
kvass
ever
and
i
must
say
i
think
that
this
is
a
good
beer
coming
out
of
ukraine
i
was
expecting
something
disgustingly
gross
but
i
actually
really
enjoy
drinking
this
one
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
kvass
to
do
some
comparisons
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
kvass
for
me
to
try
poured
from
a
brown
plastic
70
oz
bottle
has
a
cola
like
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
no
head
at
all
smell
is
of
dark
breads
and
molasses
taste
is
very
sweet
malts
molasses
a
touch
of
spice
feels
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
just
a
bit
to
sweet
for
my
liking
right
off
the
bat
this
is
far
more
carbonated
than
most
representatives
of
the
style
the
head
even
sticks
around
a
bit
as
a
ring
and
you
can
see
the
bubbles
streaming
upward
throughout
the
time
it
takes
to
empty
the
glass
it
pours
a
chestnut
brown
about
normal
for
the
style
smells
thin
and
somewhat
sour
even
acetic
a
bit
i
wouldnt
call
that
exactly
pleasant
luckily
there
is
only
a
smidgen
of
the
tang
in
the
taste
and
mostly
at
the
finish
mostly
you
get
some
light
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
some
almost
crackery
breadiness
and
then
the
sour
kicks
in
somewhat
refreshing
but
a
bit
off
balance
i
just
sliced
off
a
piece
of
kulich
easter
bread
and
it
goes
really
well
with
this
version
of
kvass
man
i
need
a
russian
mailorder
bride
at
this
rate
overall
its
well
made
and
fairly
drinkable
but
it
lacks
the
character
of
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
the
kvass
kick
continues
baby
this
one
pours
a
clear
garnetbrown
heavy
on
the
garnet
topped
by
a
shortlived
bit
o
ecru
soda
fizz
the
nose
comprises
pumpernickel
maple
syrup
fennel
and
a
touch
of
light
roasted
malts
the
taste
isnt
too
different
though
whatever
roast
character
dwelled
within
the
nose
has
escaped
so
that
it
may
avoid
the
gullet
altogether
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
light
syrupy
feel
overall
a
decent
kvass
but
this
ones
a
bit
more
fizzy
and
sodalike
than
the
others
thus
far
cant
say
that
that
endears
it
to
me
very
much
NA

a
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
clear
plastic
2
liter
bottle
has
a
cola
color
with
a
1
inch
head
considerable
carbonation
smell
is
of
molasses
malts
taste
is
bready
rye
molasses
not
bad
but
not
great
either
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
o
the
sweet
fizzy
concoction
is
interesting
but
doesnt
have
much
depth
and
the
odd
smell
makes
it
hard
to
take
another
sip
i
keep
sipping
hoping
to
find
some
old
ale
or
flanders
red
qualities
in
the
dark
fruit
and
tartness
but
they
just
arent
there
i
have
russian
friends
who
are
fond
of
telling
me
stories
of
drinking
fresh
kvas
from
dubiously
cleaned
cups
on
the
streets
of
moscow
directly
from
the
barrel
they
tell
me
all
stars
version
is
almost
as
good
as
that
stuff
back
home
though
it
lacks
the
flabby
armed
babushka
pouring
it
thats
endorsement
enough
for
me
gave
this
an
aggressive
pour
into
a
16oz
chalice
the
look
of
it
resembles
a
dark
brown
cloudy
colalike
liquid
the
head
had
a
bit
more
retention
than
a
soda
does
but
by
mid
glass
it
was
gone
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
funky
side
its
yeasty
and
a
bit
little
sweet
too
the
taste
is
sweet
its
much
more
pleasent
than
the
smell
the
taste
has
flavors
of
molasses
and
bread
there
is
virtually
no
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
with
a
syrupy
finish
overall
this
is
my
first
kvass
therefor
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
too
i
feel
that
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
definitely
glad
i
got
to
find
some
finally
o
kvass
is
a
very
interesting
style
and
something
i
had
not
ever
had
before
im
thinking
this
is
more
of
an
acquired
taste
that
something
one
tries
and
loves
the
first
time
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
though
not
something
i
would
personally
want
to
have
a
lot
of
2
liter
plastic
bottle
3
49
picked
it
up
last
week
from
the
local
russianeuropean
food
store
here
in
far
east
columbus
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
brew
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
theres
also
what
i
think
are
raisins
floating
around
in
the
bottle
it
looks
cool
just
because
of
that
aroma
is
pretty
unusual
but
then
i
havent
had
many
kvass
brews
either
it
smells
like
sourdough
and
dark
bread
molasses
and
a
bit
of
sewer
gas
thats
the
closest
thing
i
can
compare
the
unpleasant
smell
to
raisins
and
prunes
if
you
can
get
past
the
aroma
this
does
taste
a
lot
better
than
it
smells
its
mostly
sweet
it
tastes
like
dark
bread
rye
molasses
and
raisinsprunes
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
and
it
has
moderatehigh
carbonation
other
than
the
weird
aroma
which
i
got
used
to
the
longer
i
drank
it
i
liked
this
brew
a
lot
id
buy
this
again
i
thought
it
was
nice
and
tasty
thanks
liamt07
for
sending
a
style
tick
my
way
o
this
is
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
colalike
qualities
along
with
the
interesting
bread
notes
i
dont
care
for
the
aroma
that
much
due
to
the
sourness
but
id
have
this
one
again
not
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
but
goddamn
we
have
reached
a
new
level
of
packaging
the
beer
looks
like
a
cola
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
fades
rapidly
leaving
virtually
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
weak
offering
some
sweet
malt
sugar
bread
caramel
syrup
the
flavor
is
akin
to
a
sweet
cola
like
dr
pepper
or
mr
pibb
as
this
is
only
my
second
time
with
this
style
i
suppose
this
is
my
new
favorite
kvass
i
actually
drank
my
whole
glass
and
didnt
hurl
so
its
obviously
an
improvement
from
my
initial
experience
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
becomes
a
bit
much
after
a
while
one
glass
was
interesting
and
educational
but
i
wasnt
going
back
for
seconds
on
a
personal
ticking
note
this
review
finishes
off
one
of
my
reviewing
goals
on
beeradvocate
at
this
time
i
have
reviewed
a
top
3
beer
from
every
style
all
104
on
beeradvocate
overall
i
prefer
the
beaver
brewing
kvass
but
this
is
ok
if
you
really
need
one
we
went
through
about
half
the
bottle
earlier
today
and
im
not
at
all
ashamed
to
admit
that
im
going
to
polish
the
rest
of
this
off
in
due
course
throughout
the
day
o
d
pretty
drinkable
fairly
refreshing
decent
all
around
interesting
to
be
sure
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
i
had
no
difficulty
with
my
bottle
but
it
was
certainly
carbonated
as
all
getout
i
put
it
right
into
the
reefer
upon
returning
home
and
poured
it
near
but
not
over
the
sink
i
like
to
live
dangerously
lots
of
foamy
darktan
head
that
foamed
and
fizzed
and
finally
settled
into
something
that
could
actually
be
drunk
deep
hazy
brown
in
color
with
several
bloated
golden
raisins
doing
the
backstroke
in
the
bottle
i
have
little
to
no
doubt
that
this
may
be
as
close
to
authentic
short
of
visiting
mother
russia
that
i
will
get
to
try
nose
was
very
bready
slightly
sour
definitely
ryelike
mouthfeel
was
very
fizzy
and
acerbic
with
a
pleasant
not
overwhelming
sourness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
utterly
dry
leaving
me
to
wonder
what
purpose
the
raisins
might
have
served
they
lent
an
interesting
visual
dynamic
to
the
whole
thing
much
akin
to
the
bluberries
in
bos
beer
works
blueberry
ale
but
no
discernible
sweetness
it
was
definitely
thristquenching
like
drinking
ginger
ale
pop
really
and
quite
the
find
i
would
have
this
again
pours
a
murky
maroon
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
looks
quite
pretty
minus
the
weird
floating
raisins
smells
like
rye
and
raisins
a
bit
funky
on
the
nose
but
interesting
tastes
sweet
and
malty
lots
of
rye
and
the
raisin
is
very
strong
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
but
its
very
enjoyable
if
i
had
access
to
this
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
stopped
by
the
russian
market
near
work
today
and
purchased
this
odd
beverage
in
a
two
liter
bottle
they
had
this
in
the
fridge
and
it
was
damn
cold
when
i
pulled
it
out
i
guess
i
should
have
read
the
reviews
first
then
i
would
have
known
to
open
this
over
the
sink
i
was
careful
when
opening
to
release
the
pressure
slowly
but
once
i
got
the
cap
all
the
way
off
i
wasnt
quick
enough
with
the
pour
dark
brown
liquid
poured
into
my
glass
as
well
as
a
good
4
inches
of
bubbly
tan
head
lots
of
sticky
lace
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
theres
a
weird
spicy
tart
smell
in
there
along
with
some
sweetness
in
the
background
raisins
and
prunes
come
to
mind
if
you
drenched
them
in
molasses
im
almost
afraid
to
taste
it
the
taste
isnt
as
bad
as
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
this
one
is
definitely
sweet
but
has
a
rough
tart
edge
to
it
malty
caramel
molasses
prunes
raisins
kind
of
thick
body
like
drinking
unfermented
carbonated
wort
lots
of
bubbles
and
syrupy
mouth
coating
this
is
weird
but
it
really
kind
of
grew
on
me
its
more
soda
than
beer
interesting
but
this
is
probably
the
only
time
i
will
drink
this
unless
i
happen
to
be
in
russia
or
at
east
end
while
searching
my
local
international
market
for
some
other
things
this
elusive
kvass
caught
my
eye
finally
the
kvass
kick
crosses
the
pond
and
pounces
on
the
great
white
north
this
offering
to
the
kvass
gods
pours
a
sludgy
garnetsienna
topped
by
a
healthy
sandstone
froth
a
couple
fingers
high
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
pumpernickel
light
fennel
toffee
and
a
pinch
of
cocoa
powder
this
stuff
actually
smells
like
bread
i
dont
know
what
to
say
considering
all
of
the
meeker
glasses
of
kvass
that
have
passed
beneath
my
strils
the
taste
brings
in
the
same
ubersweetness
that
curses
the
other
examples
of
this
style
along
with
plenty
o
fennel
the
breadiness
drops
out
fairly
significantly
luckily
a
small
does
of
maple
syrup
and
very
light
cocoa
near
the
back
keeps
this
one
afloat
above
the
others
the
body
is
actually
kinda
thick
especially
when
compared
to
the
others
though
not
overly
so
with
a
mild
carbonation
ding
ding
ding
we
have
a
winner
here
and
a
slightly
grainy
feel
overall
id
say
this
is
possibly
the
best
kvass
ive
yet
encountered
if
you
have
but
one
kvass
this
year
make
it
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
dark
color
as
would
always
be
expected
with
a
light
beige
foam
on
the
surface
the
aromatic
smelled
of
human
emissions
theres
really
no
other
way
to
say
it
i
assume
this
was
carbonated
with
methane
the
taste
actually
wasnt
all
that
bad
it
was
the
best
tasting
of
any
kvass
that
ive
had
but
thats
like
saying
im
the
smartest
kid
in
remedial
english
this
is
pretty
slick
in
the
mouthfeel
this
drinks
okay
but
its
hard
to
get
past
the
overall
experience
2013
available
at
richs
deli
in
chicago
and
harwood
heights
three
sisters
deli
rip
overall
an
interesting
experiment
that
may
be
ok
in
small
doses
but
2l
is
way
too
big
id
split
this
with
56
people
at
least
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
it
wasnt
a
drainpour
at
least
is
there
any
way
that
this
could
be
brewed
so
as
not
to
smell
like
a
pile
of
rancid
garbage
that
would
be
my
main
complaint
drinkability
is
ok
im
glad
i
only
had
a
small
sample
and
i
wont
go
back
for
more
but
it
is
relatively
unoffensive
if
you
dont
smell
it
i
dont
think
this
will
be
supplanting
my
normal
soft
drink
choices
even
if
i
had
the
choice
but
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
in
moderate
amounts
which
would
severely
limit
its
appeal
to
the
soda
drinkers
on
this
continent
pours
a
very
hazy
and
ruddy
dark
reddish
brown
like
cola
or
root
beer
thick
and
fizzy
tan
head
forms
settles
down
to
a
thin
ring
and
leaves
some
chunks
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
weird
very
bready
rye
very
sharp
raisins
fruit
sulphurous
some
herbal
aromatics
going
on
very
strange
taste
is
actually
not
bad
very
sweet
and
raisiny
brown
sugar
root
beer
cola
rye
lightly
spicy
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
still
cant
decide
if
i
liked
this
very
interesting
stuff
thanks
derek
m
d
first
pour
was
very
prickly
having
the
bottle
get
warm
in
the
car
followed
by
slow
chilling
lead
to
an
incredibly
carbonated
bottle
it
took
about
2
minutes
to
get
the
cap
off
without
having
it
burst
all
over
and
that
showed
in
the
glass
on
subsequent
pours
that
mellowed
out
substantially
this
is
a
very
intriguing
style
though
i
dont
know
if
i
would
really
consider
it
to
truly
be
a
beer
im
not
even
sure
theres
any
alcohol
in
it
at
all
it
is
suggested
that
there
is
not
and
if
yeast
has
actually
been
skipped
allowing
for
all
natural
fermentation
of
the
rye
bread
i
dont
know
if
it
would
get
very
high
at
all
that
said
i
find
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
drink
and
i
would
like
to
revisit
it
the
next
time
i
make
it
up
to
an
area
that
serves
it
drinkability
as
no
one
at
dld
was
brave
enough
to
venture
into
this
it
looks
like
ill
be
polishing
off
the
entire
twoliter
bottle
over
the
course
of
several
nights
cant
say
im
looking
forward
to
it
but
maybe
ill
get
some
russian
culture
and
education
into
the
style
over
a
series
of
tastings
budem
strange
strange
drink
from
reading
the
reviews
of
other
kvass
this
sound
like
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
hence
the
slightly
above
average
scoring
still
its
pretty
weird
and
only
worth
trying
if
youre
very
curious
about
the
style
i
certainly
wont
return
pours
a
dark
brown
like
a
belgium
without
head
a
natural
carbonation
arising
from
the
bacteria
similar
to
a
russian
yogurt
drink
and
the
mouthfeel
similar
the
bacteria
which
is
good
guy
bacteria
interacts
in
the
mouth
for
an
hour
and
fills
you
up
and
dries
out
the
throat
as
if
i
had
a
glass
of
vodka
there
are
real
raisins
floating
in
the
bottle
the
taste
is
a
little
belgium
rasiny
a
tad
of
rye
jeff
owner
of
the
all
star
bakery
said
to
not
let
it
ferment
as
the
alcohol
will
shoot
up
from
0
5
after
a
few
weeks
in
the
fridge

o
overall
i
have
no
idea
what
to
make
of
this
beer
its
so
bizarre
its
not
really
bad
but
this
isnt
somethign
id
want
to
drink
all
day
seems
sweeter
that
a
can
of
soda
rot
your
teeth
out
sweet
intense
overall
a
decent
kvass
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
extremely
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
very
different
from
any
other
kind
of
beer
but
ontarget
for
the
style
which
makes
it
a
good
lowabv
choice
youre
looking
for
the
sweetness
that
the
style
provides
o
not
my
favorite
thing
but
decent
all
in
all
not
bad
o
i
was
truly
surprised
to
find
this
gone
so
quickly
the
murky
fruit
and
latent
tartness
grew
on
me
and
the
ample
breadiness
covered
well
an
easy
drinker
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
thanks
to
woody
i
have
a
couple
more
versions
to
compare
but
i
kinda
like
where
this
might
be
going
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
introducing
me
to
the
world
of
kvass
poured
from
a
can
i
was
unable
to
decifer
the
russian
script
to
determine
ounces
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
sweet
molasses
some
malts
taste
is
of
sweet
molasses
some
malts
and
considerably
sweet
feels
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
not
something
i
would
want
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
kvas
that
offers
a
great
dark
maltiness
its
superbly
balanced
with
the
malt
appearing
upfront
the
fruit
making
a
secondary
appearance
and
then
smoothly
transitioning
back
into
malt
additionally
it
finishes
quite
smooth
whereas
many
examples
become
sticky
sweet
and
astringent
quite
nice
the
crack
went
off
without
a
hitch
and
the
glug
created
a
foamy
finger
off
deeptanlightbrown
head
with
lousy
retention
hey
i
took
a
shower
yesterday
theres
no
need
to
run
off
and
hide
like
that
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
garnet
highlights
if
this
were
a
woman
id
be
swooning
nose
was
a
bit
more
sour
than
the
others
that
i
have
had
to
date
fermented
but
not
in
a
good
way
it
had
a
raisindateprune
odor
but
accompanied
by
an
odd
sourness
oof
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
an
immediate
taste
of
medicine
on
the
tongue
this
tasted
like
old
time
cough
syrup
the
brown
shit
that
you
had
to
hold
your
nose
to
swallow
man
i
was
not
digging
this
one
finish
left
me
thinking
that
i
might
need
to
open
a
beer
i
canteplated
a
drain
pour
but
the
ethics
department
of
the
kankwest
tm
strictly
forbids
such
things
working
through
it
i
got
a
lot
of
off
flavors
the
garlicky
sourness
noted
by
others
the
taste
of
dried
fruit
that
was
not
quite
right
tobacco
ugh
this
was
like
what
i
imagine
the
bar
drink
that
consists
of
the
bartender
pouring
the
mat
in
the
well
into
your
glass
at
the
end
of
a
long
shift
but
filtered
through
an
ashtray
would
taste
like
this
would
be
for
the
most
hardcore
of
kvasskwesters
and
even
then
i
dont
really
see
what
the
appeal
is
here
a
very
watery
kvass
not
undrinkable
to
me
i
could
actually
drink
this
the
kvass
kick
has
merged
with
brewing
day
today
this
one
pours
a
dark
auburncola
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
darkish
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
pretzels
sweat
pumpernickel
and
toasted
rye
bread
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cola
root
beer
dry
rye
bread
fennel
and
garlic
the
body
is
a
definite
medium
with
a
light
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
light
syrupy
feel
overall
i
feel
this
whole
kvass
thing
will
kill
me
that
said
this
one
was
a
decent
example
of
the
style
as
im
beginning
to
understand
it
but
it
had
a
strange
saltysour
quality
the
sweat
in
the
smell
the
garlic
in
the
taste
that
really
detracted
from
the
whole
experience
this
beer
looks
a
cola
brown
with
a
fast
fading
appearance
that
is
rather
nice
the
smell
is
of
sweaty
ball
sack
this
is
sour
and
root
like
the
taste
is
oddly
sweet
with
a
pumpernickel
spice
flavor
this
is
a
little
too
syrupy
for
my
liking
i
need
to
cut
it
with
ice
it
is
drinkable
when
doctored
with
ice
but
honestly
its
not
the
worst
kvass
ive
tasted
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
to
just
start
slamming
this
is
still
an
interesting
and
refreshing
beer
i
bet
it
really
punches
the
ticket
on
a
hot
day
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
redbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
bready
malt
with
some
honey
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
honey
with
some
raisins
and
toffee
notes
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation

oldschool
beer
from
a
completely
different
world
essentially
a
staple
beverage
from
eastern
europe
that
is
brewed
with
bread
fruit
and
other
flavorings
a
lowalcohol
beer
that
is
generally
no
more
than
2percent
abv
beaver
brewing
is
perhaps
one
of
the
only
us
breweries
that
produces
this
style
yearround
an
amazing
brew
for
what
it
is
the
world
of
kvass
is
littered
with
a
whole
mess
of
utterly
atrocious
mostly
russian
produced
garbage
out
there
so
frankly
it
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
show
them
up
regardless
this
is
a
really
nice
production
bready
tones
are
clearly
evident
surprise
and
there
is
somewhat
of
a
sweet
tone
that
comes
across
mmm
i
just
got
a
nice
hit
of
grain
on
there
seems
like
wheat
which
reminds
me
that
this
looks
like
a
wit
or
hefe
at
first
sight
the
overall
verdict
is
that
this
is
pretty
nice
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
my
stomach
but
i
am
guessing
that
is
because
this
is
a
fresh
beer
and
there
is
all
that
bread
involved
hey
i
wonder
what
kind
of
bread
he
used
for
this
o
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
it
again
it
wasnt
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
far
from
good
overall
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
here
and
still
not
sure
i
do
it
grows
on
you
a
bit
but
still
nothing
to
seek
out
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
light
straw
malt
and
bread
plus
a
mild
raisin
character
almost
a
bit
wheaty
the
flavor
takes
more
of
the
wheat
character
and
everything
is
distinctively
bready
theres
some
mild
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
takes
the
flavor
over
as
its
oddly
dry
and
bitter
very
strange
as
its
not
a
hoplike
bitterness
not
bad
though
not
something
i
would
return
to
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
my
third
kvass
and
my
favorite
so
far
this
kvass
was
remarkably
different
than
the
previous
two
it
seems
that
this
style
has
a
broad
interpretation
a
fun
and
interesting
experience
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
beer
is
thin
and
bright
on
the
palate
easy
drinking
overall
the
lead
off
is
mildly
sweet
the
midpalate
is
yeasty
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
oddly
bitter
there
seems
to
be
a
disconnect
in
the
kvas
style
some
go
toward
the
sweet
some
go
toward
the
dry
this
one
falls
more
on
the
dry
side
but
that
odd
bitterness
that
i
interpret
at
fusel
is
just
a
little
too
offputting
for
me
to
recommend
it
as
a
good
example
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
but
i
think
im
going
to
take
a
break
from
the
kvas
style
for
a
while
and
of
course
always
ask
for
the
raisins
in
the
growler
this
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
almost
like
real
lemonade
in
color
there
is
very
little
hop
aroma
owning
up
to
its
ability
to
be
served
to
younger
children
in
its
origins
the
smell
matched
up
to
the
paleness
but
offered
slight
hints
of
its
bread
core
it
has
a
citrus
finish
and
a
drinkability
ranking
up
with
cold
lemonade
on
a
summer
day
to
that
point
i
may
have
to
try
that
glad
i
was
able
to
add
this
to
my
palate
this
beer
is
a
winner
refreshing
and
low
alcohol
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
drink
all
day
while
doing
things
out
in
the
sun
grab
this
beer
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
i
would
say
this
is
moreso
a
fun
and
interesting
beverage
than
it
is
a
beer
a
unique
style
for
sure
good
on
a
summer
day
or
if
you
like
to
expirement
with
new
styles
o
not
a
big
fan
at
all
definitely
an
interesting
style
of
beer
but
i
must
say
that
i
can
see
why
many
breweries
stay
away
from
this
style
this
beer
pours
an
translucent
saffron
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
on
the
surface
the
appearance
wasnt
what
made
it
unappetizing
to
me
the
sulfurous
aroma
however
was
absolutely
what
i
would
consider
the
worst
aspect
of
this
beer
there
was
a
lot
of
bread
yeast
aroma
behind
the
sulfur
as
well
the
taste
was
rather
bland
i
would
say
it
tasted
like
water
with
bread
yeast
in
it
like
yeast
in
luke
warm
water
that
you
are
trying
to
prep
to
make
homemade
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
fine
overall
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
get
into
this
beer
im
not
sure
what
everyone
was
tasting
with
it
but
it
sure
as
heck
didnt
taste
all
that
great
to
me
what
better
way
for
the
original
kvass
kick
to
continue
chuggin
along
than
to
revisit
the
roots
of
the
style
none
say
i
allegedly
the
boys
at
beaver
brewed
this
in
the
traditional
manner
including
leaving
it
out
on
the
windowsill
nice
it
pours
a
cloudy
sallow
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
stark
white
foam
offhand
i
wouldnt
think
this
was
even
a
kvass
given
the
general
darkness
of
nearly
every
other
example
presented
to
me
the
nose
comprises
soapy
chive
rye
bread
rosemary
sage
and
coriander
what
a
slightly
odd
though
mostly
pleasant
spice
cabinet
odor
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
with
notes
of
wheat
light
onion
light
chive
light
fennel
and
some
very
light
coriander
a
pinch
of
pepper
may
or
may
not
have
been
thrown
in
for
good
measure
honestly
given
the
description
of
the
ingredients
and
the
process
i
expected
more
of
a
robust
flavor
somewhere
in
here
but
its
still
pretty
nice
if
overtly
inoffensive
the
body
is
a
weirdly
heftyfeeling
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
damn
nice
traditional
kvass
a
welcome
alternative
to
the
sadder
more
sodalike
varieties
that
seem
to
pop
up
much
more
often
we
need
more
of
these
more
oldschool
types
round
here
dammit
the
strangest
part
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
nothing
like
the
east
end
kvass
not
even
a
little
bit
both
are
excellently
tasty
and
indeed
i
dont
think
i
could
choose
one
if
forced
to
i
would
need
to
have
them
both
pours
a
hazy
straw
like
color
with
a
tight
skim
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
breadiness
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
nice
sourdough
breadiness
to
it
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
grainess
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
very
solid
true
to
the
style
and
a
very
easy
very
enjoyable
drink
the
raisins
in
the
growler
give
this
a
5
for
appearnace
o
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
the
brew
but
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
would
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
humid
day
after
reading
the
style
notes
i
think
this
is
pretty
spot
on
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
had
this
one
a
bit
ago
poured
out
as
the
traditional
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
that
fades
rapidly
the
smell
of
this
is
of
dark
fruits
and
molasses
the
taste
is
primarily
the
same
things
as
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
bread
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
much
like
a
soda
generously
carbonated
and
thin
feeling
overall
its
a
pretty
standard
kvass
not
one
that
i
would
have
to
seek
out
in
the
future
this
is
quite
tasty
but
it
feels
too
much
like
soda
pop
to
me
i
really
do
like
the
nose
on
this
and
hint
of
dry
bread
o
overall
while
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
style
i
left
my
personal
taste
out
of
this
this
beer
is
better
than
average
as
far
as
kvass
goes
i
still
dont
like
it
but
it
is
a
better
one
id
rather
drink
any
american
adjunct
over
this
and
i
have
no
idea
how
people
can
drink
a
whole
can
of
this
overall
just
i
dont
even
have
words
to
describe
it
i
wouldnt
even
call
this
beer
and
im
not
sure
how
they
can
get
away
with
it
its
like
very
partially
fermented
mash
of
rye
bread
raisins
corn
stalk
molasses
gerbil
ass
dog
biscuit
and
the
lost
souls
of
genghis
khan
and
his
horse
all
blended
until
fermentation
was
about
to
start
when
the
yeast
just
died
of
asphyxiation
although
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
its
at
least
a
step
up
from
sam
adams
triple
bock
d
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
extremely
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
it
has
what
you
look
for
in
the
style
but
there
are
other
choices
in
the
style
that
are
a
bit
better
a
pretty
average
experience
for
a
beer
but
unusual
and
not
a
bad
thirst
quencher
pours
a
nice
ruby
brown
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
pretty
though
definitely
not
a
bad
looking
beer
smells
interesting
awful
at
first
but
improves
as
it
warms
up
taste
sweet
and
wonderful
lots
of
rye
and
raisin
vry
thin
though
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
ruins
the
beer
overall
odd
but
not
very
good
d
this
is
pretty
terrible
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
i
expected
from
the
aroma
many
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
introducing
me
to
the
world
of
kvass
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
can
has
a
dark
cola
like
color
with
no
head
at
all
some
carbonation
smell
is
of
molasses
very
sweet
taste
is
way
to
sweet
for
my
liking
lots
of
molasses
some
fruit
notes
kind
of
like
the
malta
drink
sold
at
the
dominicanpuerto
rican
restaurant
around
the
corner
from
my
job
only
much
sweeter
feels
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
i
was
not
impressed
overall
overall
its
a
decent
enough
kvas
thats
really
well
made
but
i
yearn
for
a
little
more
of
the
traditional
character
flaws
and
all
the
crack
went
off
without
any
issues
and
the
glug
produced
a
fizzy
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
limited
retention
wave
byebye
color
was
a
deepreddish
brown
with
ruby
or
garnet
highlights
beautiful
nose
gave
off
notes
of
drying
tobacco
prunes
and
raisin
bread
mouthfeel
was
fuller
than
i
remember
from
the
bottle
and
it
had
an
oddly
slightly
sour
taste
on
the
tongue
it
was
very
driedfruit
like
in
its
flavor
think
raisins
and
prunes
with
an
underlying
cola
flavor
but
accompanied
by
a
slight
sourness
wild
finish
was
rather
dry
with
a
taste
like
raisin
bread
that
absolutely
lingered
there
are
only
three
3
kanned
kvasses
afaik
so
i
will
reserve
judgment
on
its
kooler
worthiness
until
i
have
tried
them
all
my
first
квас
definitely
looking
forward
to
more
drinkability
this
taste
a
lot
like
malta
india
a
beerlike
soft
drink
that
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
however
maltas
dont
wear
on
the
palate
like
this
beverage
does
its
reminiscent
of
sucking
out
a
cocacola
spilled
on
the
back
deck
doubt
ill
ever
seek
out
another
the
appearance
is
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
fades
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
sugary
caramels
the
taste
is
just
overbearing
ridiculously
sweet
and
instantly
cloying
i
just
couldnt
get
more
than
a
few
ounces
down
it
was
really
cool
to
try
a
kvass
for
the
first
time
but
i
did
not
find
this
beer
or
perhaps
even
this
style
to
my
liking
beer
is
thin
and
super
sweet
difficult
to
drink
oddly
bitter
and
jaw
hurting
i
eventually
give
up
and
pour
the
rest
out
still
havent
figured
out
the
appeal
poured
a
maroonish
brown
with
a
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
consisted
of
a
variety
of
grains
slight
dark
fruits
some
sugar
sweetness
and
faint
bready
notes
the
flavors
on
this
brew
reminded
me
of
iced
tea
with
grains
prunes
and
a
sticky
malty
presence
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
sweet
and
grainy
finish
i
honeslty
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
definitely
try
to
get
more
beer
of
this
style
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
and
drank
exceptionally
well
for
me
and
had
coming
back
for
seconds
since
there
was
plenty
of
it
due
to
the
big
liter
bottle
offering
d
i
tried
this
because
i
was
interested
in
trying
the
style
but
i
do
not
have
any
burning
desire
to
try
it
again
i
just
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
NA
from
the
can
yeah
thisll
put
hair
on
your
chest
foul
as
it
is
i
did
kind
of
like
the
aroma
on
it
really
did
smell
like
russian
black
bread
or
some
kind
of
rye
or
sourdough
dont
really
want
to
drink
that
though
for
all
i
know
this
may
be
a
fabulous
kvass
but
to
me
it
tastes
like
beef
bouillon
with
a
dose
of
root
beer
interesting
woody
leaf
mold
smell
with
a
whiff
of
mouse
pee
soy
sauce
with
a
koolaid
undertone
bottoms
up
looks
and
smells
much
better
to
me
than
it
tastes
reminds
me
of
dr
pepper
which
is
made
with
prunes
this
has
the
look
and
the
body
of
a
beer
i
dont
think
theres
any
question
about
it
it
just
carries
the
sweetness
of
a
soft
drink
but
apparently
not
nearly
as
much
sugar
as
a
coke
cant
figure
that
out
luckily
i
grabbed
another
can
of
a
different
brand
so
well
see
how
that
measures
up
otastes
like
a
beer
flavored
soda
or
soda
flavored
beer
i
cant
decide
its
surprisingly
good
and
very
drinkable
i
enjoy
the
format
as
well
big
plastic
bottle
its
fitting
overall
the
flavors
were
all
right
but
it
suffered
from
such
low
carbonation
picked
up
a
can
of
this
from
a
local
russian
deli
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
quickly
hit
by
the
sweet
molasses
aroma
was
like
sticking
my
nose
in
a
jar
of
molasses
being
a
dark
beer
guy
i
liked
how
it
look
until
the
nice
tan
head
faded
about
30
seconds
beer
had
a
dark
hazy
brown
look
and
a
strong
sweet
aroma
taste
was
like
prunes
and
molasses
very
sweet
hell
this
is
prune
juice
mouthfeel
is
light
and
flat
with
a
sour
aftertaste
never
had
anything
like
this
before
im
glad
ive
tried
this
but
im
not
sure
what
to
do
with
it
maybe
id
like
a
strong
kvass
thats
more
sour
maybe
i
just
need
to
find
a
better
kvass
o
not
anything
traditionally
beer
like
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
ill
pick
up
a
birch
beer
sometime
to
see
how
it
compares
drink
well
the
hardest
two
styles
are
ticked
this
is
just
odd
to
me
raisins
sugar
bread
its
kinda
bad
but
i
keep
drinking
it
overall
not
bad
but
not
really
interesting
or
exciting
but
it
is
drinkable
o
overall
this
is
much
different
and
better
than
the
others
tastes
almost
like
raisin
water
i
still
cant
consume
a
whole
can
of
this
but
its
not
bad
o
the
aroma
was
just
unpleasant
flavor
wasnt
too
bad
though
o
with
all
of
the
sweetness
drinking
this
beer
definitely
takes
some
getting
used
to
although
it
does
taste
a
little
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
o
for
what
it
is
this
is
pretty
damn
tasty
and
incredibly
drinkable
i
definitely
see
this
as
a
nice
drink
in
the
summer
when
nothing
else
sounds
good
it
definitely
is
soda
like
and
is
really
sweet
but
i
kinda
like
it
why
arent
there
eastern
european
markets
in
vernal
ut
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
bot
is
it
a
daunting
beer
style
to
drink
overall
a
pretty
average
thirst
quencher
glad
i
could
try
the
style
and
would
not
have
any
great
exception
to
drinking
another
one
just
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
very
different
but
not
something
i
ever
want
to
drink
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
this
beer
is
decent
low
abv
alternative
o
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
again
i
guess
if
its
all
you
got
i
could
see
pounding
a
few
of
these
if
they
were
ice
cold
im
glad
i
got
to
try
a
kvass
though
as
i
continue
my
quest
to
broaden
my
palate
thanks
again
woodychandler
for
sending
one
of
these
my
way
cheers
o
i
didnt
score
a
single
category
too
highly
ok
smell
is
a
4
yet
here
i
am
scoring
a
bit
higher
for
the
overall
harken
back
to
the
drinkability
days
of
not
so
long
ago
i
find
this
to
be
a
benign
yet
cheerful
sort
of
drink
the
kind
i
dont
have
to
have
again
but
certainly
wouldnt
refuse
either
its
like
salted
cola
and
thats
ok
by
me
i
would
never
compare
kvass
to
beer
they
are
two
entirely
different
animals
even
when
you
lump
together
ales
stouts
and
lagers
together
all
as
beer
kvass
still
doesnt
fit
amongst
them
its
not
really
an
alcoholic
beverage
1
on
average
in
russia
it
is
served
on
the
street
from
giant
metal
tanks
probably
50100
gallons
in
size
and
it
is
loved
by
children
and
adults
alike
on
hot
summer
days
when
i
judge
a
bottled
or
canned
kvass
i
always
compare
it
against
the
street
kvass
which
is
the
best
it
cant
be
compared
to
any
type
of
beer
d
a
very
different
beer
i
realize
this
fits
the
style
however
it
is
almost
undrinkable
for
me
very
sugary
sweet
and
weird
overall
im
giving
it
a
c
rating
since
it
is
the
first
one
for
me
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
would
like
to
try
another
but
i
can
wait
thanks
again
woodychandler
i
will
definitely
recan
the
favor
o
better
than
i
expected
i
could
see
myself
downing
some
of
these
if
they
were
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
many
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
introducing
me
to
the
world
of
kvass
poured
from
a
17
6
oz
can
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
molassesand
herbs
some
malts
taste
is
the
same
some
molassess
herbs
and
spices
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
kvass
i
reviewed
the
other
night
feels
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
this
was
not
bad
it
is
not
something
i
would
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
overall
ochakovskiy
is
wellmade
wellbalanced
and
fairly
complex
its
russias
market
leader
and
rightfully
so
this
was
as
flat
as
a
board
and
generated
no
head
at
all
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
nose
had
a
smoky
scent
which
was
interesting
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
caramelnutty
flavor
in
the
mouth
and
none
of
the
cloying
sweetness
that
i
had
experienced
in
the
others
finish
reminded
me
of
walnuts
and
caramel
but
not
particularly
sweet
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
of
this
or
any
kvass
to
date
but
this
was
the
best
of
the
lot
the
cpj
taste
oh
god
i
couldnt
take
this
i
wanted
to
expand
my
horizons
was
drinking
it
with
the
russian
girlfriend
wanted
to
make
a
decent
effort
to
liketry
it
but
could
not
finish
it
couldnt
even
come
close
nearly
gag
inducing
cloying
and
sweet
like
pureed
berries
molasses
and
castor
oil
the
kvass
kick
continues
its
overlap
with
brewing
day
this
kvass
pours
a
translucent
very
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
somewhere
around
a
finger
of
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
sourdough
rye
bread
light
bad
milk
and
some
very
light
roasted
malts
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
cola
light
root
beer
sour
rye
melba
toast
and
caramel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
light
syrupy
feel
overall
one
of
the
nicer
kvass
entries
though
a
bit
light
in
the
body
i
might
be
getting
used
to
these
drinks
this
beer
pours
a
fizzy
darkness
with
tan
foam
that
fades
to
only
a
lace
the
smell
is
a
bit
too
potent
mostly
it
smells
of
soy
sauce
sesame
oil
and
vinegar
that
is
not
a
good
combo
without
a
wok
involved
the
taste
is
not
good
either
its
sour
and
bready
and
really
a
vinegar
astringency
making
it
really
unpleasant
this
may
be
one
of
the
worst
kvasses
that
ive
ever
had
and
at
this
point
its
my
3rd
though
it
is
repulsive
to
the
senses
it
can
but
cut
with
ice
and
drinks
like
a
normal
kvass
even
if
it
does
suck
i
cant
say
much
about
how
this
is
for
the
kvass
style
but
its
not
very
good
overall
tastes
like
kvass
di
used
to
drink
this
a
lot
when
i
shopped
at
russian
grocery
stores
in
philadelphia
i
dont
have
as
much
of
a
taste
for
it
anymore
but
its
nice
every
once
in
awhile
d
while
i
love
trying
new
beer
this
is
one
style
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
revisiting
ive
been
taking
small
sip
to
experience
it
but
now
that
my
review
is
done
so
is
my
experience
with
the
beer
its
not
something
i
ever
want
to
have
again
or
finish
for
that
matter
but
i
cant
just
bashing
a
beer
i
dont
like
personally
based
on
inexperience
with
the
style
odd
certainly
but
it
doesnt
seem
off
in
any
way
its
incredibly
sweet
like
unfermented
wort
toasted
grain
a
sour
twang
molasses
malt
extract
really
sweet
yet
thin
colalike
kind
of
fruity
too
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
malt
soda
what
the
hell
is
this
do
people
actually
drink
this
stuff
drinkability
im
still
on
the
fence
regarding
kvass
as
a
style
this
tastes
more
like
a
soft
drink
to
me
indeed
at
2
its
pretty
soft
indeed
still
the
flavor
is
interesting
call
it
average
enjoyable
the
hotter
it
gets
outside
the
better
it
tastes
pours
a
light
brown
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
woodlike
quite
odd
and
offputting
the
flavor
is
almost
worse
damn
near
made
me
gag
just
a
weird
fake
cherry
sweetness
that
is
so
cloying
it
is
disgusting
honestly
i
cant
give
any
more
detail
because
i
couldnt
stomach
another
sip
or
smell
d
its
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
its
more
bizarre
than
anything
else
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
that
said
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
appearance
is
somewhat
murky
dark
dark
brown
thin
head
dissipates
into
a
ring
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
pronounced
bread
a
strange
sourish
malty
smell
some
caramel
and
toast
actually
kind
of
nervous
to
take
a
drink
here
goes
the
first
sip
and
wow
kind
of
tastes
like
a
flat
cola
the
sweetness
is
all
over
the
place
i
can
even
taste
it
on
my
lips
after
finishing
the
drink
flavor
of
tea
and
sugar
dr
pepperish
flavor
in
there
each
sip
gets
a
little
better
but
this
isnt
a
good
flavor
overall
mouthfeel
is
super
thin
not
much
going
on
and
its
unpleasant
drinkability
is
low
i
might
be
able
to
finis
this
but
wont
beat
myself
up
for
a
second
if
i
dont
d
the
verdict
kvass
is
gross
but
not
horrifying
worth
trying
once
beer
is
super
thin
and
really
sweet
finishes
a
little
dry
but
has
a
terrible
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
it
by
far
the
biggest
thing
about
this
beer
unfortunately
i
cannot
recommend
it
its
rough
second
taste
not
as
bad
but
still
really
really
rough
with
a
strong
after
taste
drinkability
low
practically
a
drain
pour
it
reminds
me
of
a
malta
drink
from
the
caribbean
is
it
really
beer
i
suppose
in
a
broad
sense
as
it
is
made
of
fermented
malts
but
more
of
a
dark
malt
beverage
very
sweet
poured
into
a
mug
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
fizzy
offwhite
head
not
much
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
toffee
molasses
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
sweet
with
some
toffeecaramelprunes
notes
lightmedium
body
drinkable
not
that
bad
but
quite
the
different
brew
this
kvass
poured
a
deep
dark
red
brown
color
with
brown
that
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
in
places
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
with
good
sized
bubbles
the
smell
was
richly
malty
with
notes
of
molasses
and
prunes
the
taste
was
prunes
molasses
malt
dark
bread
and
a
bit
of
yeast
there
was
a
slight
tanginess
like
a
dark
rye
bread
and
a
moderate
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
light
body
and
strong
carbonation
feel
light
sweetness
overall
but
the
sweet
malty
flavors
lingered
this
was
a
refreshing
malt
beverage
very
low
in
alcohol
m
d
a
good
carbonation
but
a
weaker
body
a
little
watery
even
drinkability
is
fine
in
the
sense
of
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
due
to
lack
of
alcohol
content
its
not
a
very
pleasant
representation
of
the
style
though
drinkability
is
this
kvass
probably
is
it
a
good
kvass
probably
do
i
like
kvass
no
do
russians
like
kvass
if
so
why
this
isnt
necessarily
the
style
for
me
but
just
like
how
i
try
and
enjoy
a
margarita
when
i
get
mexican
food
i
suppose
i
could
have
one
of
these
if
i
was
in
the
appropriate
location
hv
i
almost
gag
every
time
i
take
a
sip
of
this
tastes
like
dayold
miller
high
life
with
some
bread
chocolate
and
coffee
mixed
in
it
looks
like
cola
and
at
first
it
smells
like
oh
say
a
bottle
of
old
milwaukee
if
only
it
tasted
even
half
as
good
as
old
milwaukee
please
for
your
own
sake
stay
away
d
bad
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
style
and
am
starting
to
think
it
will
be
my
last
the
flavors
in
this
beer
just
do
not
work
for
me
on
any
level
started
out
with
a
decent
aroma
but
just
went
down
hill
from
there
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
style
out
but
im
not
impressed
by
this
particular
selection
d
its
hard
for
me
to
judge
this
beer
since
im
unclear
on
what
it
should
taste
like
never
the
less
im
not
going
to
finish
this
can
and
i
wont
be
looking
for
another
dave
buckeyesox
shared
this
with
me
i
believe
ultimately
it
came
to
oh
from
prototypic
im
appreciative
of
the
opportunity
to
try
a
new
beer
style
having
been
a
free
glass
of
kvass
im
apprehensive
to
give
a
poor
review
but
i
feel
i
must
do
so
the
beers
appearance
is
not
bad
dark
caramelcopper
color
a
little
murky
very
thin
head
the
beers
smell
is
tealike
and
a
little
medicinal
kind
of
an
aged
beer
aroma
not
unlike
gouden
carolus
i
have
no
frame
of
reference
for
a
kvass
so
this
gets
a
3
the
taste
is
strong
with
overripe
dark
fruit
like
plums
or
dates
hands
down
the
most
unique
beer
ive
ever
had
i
didnt
like
it
persay
but
i
dont
regret
a
single
sip
im
very
thankful
to
prototypic
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
i
came
into
this
experience
with
an
open
mind
honestly
the
reality
of
ochakovskiy
kvass
is
that
its
shockingly
revoltingly
bad
and
it
wont
even
get
you
drunk
the
fact
that
anyone
might
enjoy
it
is
mindboggling
thanks
to
prototypic
for
the
opportunity
as
far
as
comparing
extremely
difficult
styles
to
obtain
that
happen
to
be
nothing
alike
it
is
much
more
unique
and
exotic
than
happoshu
i
cant
even
remotely
compare
kvass
to
any
beer
ive
tried
before
happoshu
was
a
different
story
despite
its
underwhelmingness
it
is
recommended
simply
for
the
experience
i
really
dont
think
that
this
is
anything
like
a
typical
beer
style
so
instead
of
using
the
typical
standards
i
will
focus
more
on
how
it
matches
up
to
the
style
and
other
examples
of
kvass
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
had
of
kvass
outside
of
russia
it
does
seem
a
little
bit
sweet
in
taste
which
is
reflected
in
the
smell
the
apperance
and
mouthfeel
are
similar
to
pretty
much
every
other
kvass
i
have
had
the
carbonation
is
pretty
close
but
i
like
my
kvass
with
just
a
little
less
carbonation
just
like
almost
every
other
example
of
this
style
this
kvass
has
an
incredible
amount
of
drinkability
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
and
just
might
this
was
not
something
i
would
choose
to
drink
often
even
if
i
could
choose
it
over
soda
but
i
am
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
well
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
isnt
something
i
would
order
instead
of
beer
or
a
soda
well
this
is
my
first
kvass
except
for
various
softdrink
versions
of
them
so
im
not
exactly
sure
what
to
expect
so
its
a
bit
hard
to
review
to
style
pours
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
almost
no
head
what
head
there
is
settles
as
the
thinnest
possible
ring
smells
like
rye
bread
and
a
touch
of
sourness
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
somewhat
sour
the
sweetness
is
far
less
than
the
softdrink
varieties
of
this
stuff
and
this
is
less
malty
tasting
as
well
tastes
more
like
rye
bread
with
some
butter
and
sugar
and
a
bit
of
sour
grain
tossed
in
not
unpleasant
but
not
like
your
average
beer
either
still
i
could
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
or
with
some
russian
food
in
fact
i
prefer
this
to
some
russian
eurolager
interesting
to
say
the
least
fairly
thin
and
refreshing
im
glad
i
spent
the
3
bucks
at
the
russian
grocery
store
to
try
whats
regarded
as
a
true
example
of
this
style
maybe
its
flatter
than
it
should
be
maybe
i
could
use
it
as
a
reduction
in
some
weird
sauce
maybe
it
could
go
with
vanilla
ice
cream
as
a
float
naaahhh
maybe
ill
just
pour
the
whole
deal
down
the
drain
and
chalk
it
up
to
experience
not
a
redeeming
quality
here
except
for
the
first
pour
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
the
beer
or
the
style
or
what
but
this
was
totally
undrinkable
and
i
would
not
ever
want
to
come
across
this
again
thanks
to
grandq
for
this
one
its
a
16
oz
tallboy
can
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
is
really
odd
and
very
strong
its
reminding
me
of
something
that
i
just
cant
place
i
pick
up
rye
molasses
and
brown
sugar
candy
the
taste
is
incredibly
sweet
not
much
else
it
is
almost
like
a
cola
its
full
bodied
overall
drinkability
is
low
i
dont
consider
it
a
beer
and
it
is
just
not
for
me
poured
a
16oz
tallboy
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
sizable
fish
eyed
white
head
and
pretty
active
carbonation
wow
the
aroma
is
like
a
smack
in
the
face
rye
and
molasses
straight
up
its
actually
really
odd
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
in
a
bad
way
while
i
have
no
experience
with
the
style
and
dont
know
if
its
supposed
to
taste
like
i
cant
imagine
want
to
drink
this
again
the
flavor
is
like
a
cloying
sweet
cola
without
the
sugar
instead
substitute
the
sugar
for
sorghum
molasses
and
saccharine
there
is
a
definite
herbalmedicinal
quality
to
the
beer
too
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
light
soda
but
has
a
sacchariney
sweet
mouth
feel
like
i
said
earlier
i
dont
think
i
will
be
searching
out
another
kvass
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
head
smell
is
odd
molasses
and
castor
oil
sheesh
flavor
is
ack
yowzas
sweet
and
weird
to
me
no
real
great
levwel
of
complexity
kind
of
like
an
odd
cola
which
is
what
grandq
the
kvass
king
has
described
it
as
im
not
really
even
sure
how
to
rate
this
its
so
unusual
and
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
style
fairly
smooth
feel
with
a
cola
like
carbonation
thanks
to
grandq
for
the
kvass
hookup
great
to
knock
the
style
off
the
list
but
i
cant
see
myself
going
for
this
oddity
again
full
bodied
fairly
sweet
with
no
traces
of
alcohol
very
sweet
drinks
like
a
soda
and
is
better
than
most
a
very
strange
beer
but
very
nice
anyways
this
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
whisp
of
head
that
dies
rather
quickly
aromas
are
all
bready
malt
and
caramel
like
rye
bread
raisin
soda
taste
is
great
malty
sweet
and
very
filling
its
nutritous
to
boot
drinkability
for
me
is
perfect
this
is
not
a
beer
at
all
but
i
love
this
stuff
i
only
generally
drink
water
tea
coffee
beer
wine
spirits
juice
and
dairy
kefir
etc
this
is
the
noly
soda
type
beverage
i
drink
and
it
is
absolutely
stellar
hangover
relief
d
i
like
this
beer
with
some
qualities
that
make
it
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
wild
ale
and
a
dry
cola
interesting
flavor
and
not
sugary
sweet
like
pop
whadda
ya
know
they
did
have
some
most
kvass
ive
had
has
been
from
soda
makers
even
coca
colas
made
a
foray
into
the
russian
kvass
market
but
i
understand
this
comes
from
russias
second
largest
domestic
brewer
and
as
such
this
example
is
much
less
sweet
than
a
lot
of
the
brown
plastic
bottled
versions
recommended
its
available
in
multiple
size
plastic
bottles
as
well
as
in
tall
cans
with
its
sweetness
it
reminds
me
of
german
malzbier
but
it
is
not
nearly
as
thick
and
syrupy
as
that
refreshing
and
interesting
if
a
bit
sweet
this
is
definitely
a
style
i
want
to
explore
more
i
would
love
to
find
a
traditional
example
ill
definitely
try
the
other
examples
that
are
at
the
local
eastern
european
market
the
taste
makes
you
pucker
at
first
but
the
after
taste
is
a
melange
of
the
above
aroma
notes
fun
to
try
dont
know
if
id
enjoy
a
whole
bottle
though
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
guess
i
should
stop
messing
with
kvasses
now
i
can
appreciate
the
history
of
the
style
but
its
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
guess
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
could
choke
down
a
pint
but
no
way
in
hell
was
i
going
to
drink
33
oz
poured
down
the
drain
after
a
few
gulps
i
dont
need
to
needlessly
deal
with
this
torture
overall
well
i
got
my
kvass
tick
but
dont
see
myself
exploring
this
style
too
much
interesting
none
the
less
higher
overall
score
since
it
is
so
unique
thanks
to
woodychandler
and
his
kvass
kick
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
clear
plastic
1
liter
bottle
has
a
cola
like
color
with
no
head
at
all
smell
is
of
molasses
and
rye
taste
is
prettty
good
rye
up
front
sweet
molasses
a
touch
of
raisin
and
spices
feels
sweet
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
brew
this
was
one
flat
drink
i
poured
as
best
i
could
to
stir
up
some
carbonation
but
to
no
avail
color
was
a
copperybrown
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
really
pungent
with
rye
akin
to
a
loaf
of
bread
fresh
from
the
oven
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
initial
taste
of
rye
bread
but
then
giving
over
to
a
raisin
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
an
interesting
sweetsour
quality
to
it
as
though
neither
of
the
previously
noted
flavors
could
really
dominate
i
imagine
this
to
be
pretty
close
to
a
traditional
form
of
the
style
and
it
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
thus
far
overall
this
is
another
impressive
kvas
its
the
first
one
ive
found
that
has
no
real
carbonation
to
it
which
is
more
traditional
kvas
was
served
flat
until
the
1980s
when
producers
tried
to
fizz
it
up
to
help
compete
with
western
colas
and
if
you
coma
across
a
yellow
tank
on
wheels
in
russia
or
blue
or
white
in
the
ukraine
itll
be
serving
flat
kvas
worth
trying
cheers
lifeless
feel
with
weak
carbonation
and
cloying
sweetness
compared
to
other
commercial
kvass
this
is
slightly
more
roastybready
raisin
prune
and
molasses
flavors
with
a
mellow
rye
breadiness
sweet
like
soda
somewhat
astringent
overall
its
drinkable
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
pretty
typical
for
a
commercial
kvass
on
the
lower
end
of
the
quality
spectrum
the
kvass
kick
rolls
into
the
ukraine
with
this
a
smaller
bottle
than
usual
it
pours
a
clear
ambergarnet
topped
by
a
minor
wisp
of
offwhite
fizz
the
nose
comprises
heavy
caraway
seed
fennel
rye
bread
maple
syrup
and
walnuts
the
taste
focuses
on
the
caraway
and
fennel
with
some
burnt
maple
syrup
bubbling
up
from
underneath
to
form
a
backbone
of
sorts
its
all
kind
of
overwhelming
really
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
thickly
watery
feel
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
underwhelming
entries
the
kick
thus
far
the
flavors
are
just
too
much
and
too
disjointed
to
really
work
right
this
coupled
with
a
lighterthanusual
body
makes
for
a
notsoenjoyable
kvassdrinking
experience
beer
is
thin
and
sweet
still
on
the
palate
finish
is
grainy
and
bitter
it
is
like
flat
soda
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
not
a
repeat
but
not
the
worst
kvas
ive
had
pours
a
dark
brown
reddish
tint
a
touch
of
wie
hed
on
the
rim
of
the
glass
looks
decent
smells
oxidized
and
malty
lots
of
raisony
charcteristics
tastes
sweet
and
malty
lote
of
dark
fruits
a
bit
watery
bt
surprisingly
carbonated
overall
not
that
exciting
but
solid
o
i
dont
like
it
its
just
a
weird
thing
its
barely
beer
i
dont
know
not
recommended
so
i
used
to
work
at
a
discount
food
store
and
one
day
a
pallet
of
this
stuff
showed
up
so
i
bought
a
plastic
bottle
of
it
for
75
cents
and
gave
it
a
shot
later
i
learned
i
should
have
bought
more
its
made
in
the
same
town
my
gf
is
from
penza
and
she
loves
it
who
knew
crazy
russians
anyway
out
of
the
plastic
bottle
this
beer
was
brown
like
a
coca
cola
with
a
short
lived
head
that
quickly
fizzled
out
to
nothing
very
little
lacing
was
present
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
with
notes
of
molasses
brown
sugar
rye
bread
and
yeast
the
flavors
were
similar
to
a
soda
with
a
pungent
note
of
fermentation
at
the
very
end
lot
of
rye
molasses
raisins
and
a
bit
of
caramel
followed
by
a
sour
yeasty
finish
pleasant
but
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
the
body
was
light
the
carbonation
light
and
the
mouthfeel
thin
very
odd
but
im
glad
i
finally
know
what
she
was
talking
about
when
she
said
theyd
drink
kvass
all
summer
overall
its
one
of
the
cleaner
and
more
balanced
kvass
ive
tasted
thats
good
in
that
its
relatively
accessible
but
i
personally
prefer
kvas
that
has
a
little
more
character
this
beer
glugs
from
its
plastic
bottle
into
the
pint
glass
with
a
brown
cola
like
appearance
to
it
taupe
foam
is
not
long
lasting
in
the
slightest
the
aroma
smells
like
cracked
wheat
bread
or
perhaps
pumpernickel
either
way
it
smells
like
tasty
bread
however
its
is
disgustingly
sweet
to
the
taste
the
bread
comes
through
tasting
like
it
was
covered
in
corn
syrup
for
a
kvass
its
actually
not
all
that
bad
for
a
beer
its
disgusting
i
could
have
used
some
carbonation
on
this
one
to
help
out
the
mouthfeel
and
the
super
sticky
sweetness
overall
this
was
an
average
kvass
nothing
exceptional
about
it
i
still
dont
like
these
beers
but
i
can
tolerate
them
when
cut
by
water
or
ice
cubes
whatever
is
on
hand
after
too
long
o
delay
the
original
kvass
kick
returns
to
the
original
kvassland
ive
been
itchin
for
a
new
kvass
for
a
couple
weeks
now
so
lets
dive
in
it
pours
a
clear
dark
garnet
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
even
some
effort
in
pouring
didnt
yield
much
more
than
a
few
sparse
bubbles
on
the
surface
sad
really
the
nose
comprises
rye
crust
fennel
honey
cola
mild
roasted
malts
and
some
even
milder
lighter
airier
cocoa
in
the
back
the
taste
follows
this
formula
emphasizing
the
fennel
and
cola
over
the
others
without
smothering
them
out
altogether
a
slice
of
sourdough
and
lightly
tart
berry
cuts
in
near
the
finish
to
round
things
out
the
body
is
a
weak
medium
with
a
lightly
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
limply
syrupy
feel
overall
not
a
bad
kvass
really
things
are
just
bready
enough
to
not
be
confused
with
root
beer
but
the
feel
was
a
little
on
the
sad
side
for
me
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
beverage
im
really
unsure
as
to
whether
i
would
even
consider
kvass
to
be
beer
though
admittedly
this
is
the
only
one
ive
tried
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
drink
this
could
make
a
good
summer
refresher
and
is
a
good
change
of
pace
from
typical
colas
more
refreshing
as
well
as
it
doesnt
leave
you
thirsty
afterwards
a
unique
drink
certainly
worth
trying
once
personally
i
doubt
ill
have
this
much
but
it
can
be
good
from
timetotime
overall
its
good
for
what
it
is
and
it
seems
to
be
fairly
representative
of
the
style
i
would
not
classify
it
as
beer
though
its
not
even
considered
an
alcoholic
beverage
in
russia
give
it
a
try
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
but
i
definitely
have
had
worse
supposedly
great
beers
i
wouldnt
repurchase
this
but
i
might
try
others
of
its
style
especially
american
interpretations
overall
the
balance
of
this
brew
makes
it
very
quaffable
there
are
some
disappointing
areas
here
but
overall
experience
and
drinkability
are
quite
good
o
its
like
drinking
a
really
sweet
flat
cola
i
think
more
carbonation
would
help
this
is
my
first
dalliance
with
this
style
i
would
like
to
try
some
others
for
comparison
poured
this
one
out
among
the
family
yesterday
at
our
annual
christmas
party
the
for
many
of
them
it
was
their
first
time
trying
kvass
basically
i
sold
it
to
them
as
a
russian
soda
many
didnt
like
it
and
found
it
hard
to
drink
a
23
full
glass
of
it
either
way
it
pours
out
as
a
clear
looking
reddish
brown
color
there
is
a
thin
and
quick
fading
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
its
got
a
boat
load
of
molasses
on
the
nose
as
well
as
plenty
of
breadlike
aromas
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
for
the
most
part
there
is
the
main
flavor
of
molasses
and
bread
followed
by
what
i
thought
tasted
like
grapes
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
this
was
much
like
a
soda
watered
down
and
carbonated
not
much
complexity
at
all
overall
its
a
pretty
traditional
kvass
not
much
else
to
say
its
a
decent
drink
but
not
something
i
would
rush
out
to
buy
more
of
tastes
tangy
and
full
of
raisins
bready
rye
and
barley
linger
not
overly
sweet
and
only
moderately
so
finishes
sort
of
dry
must
be
the
sugar
though
thin
and
watery
as
commercial
kvas
often
is
though
not
always
very
drinkable
though
in
small
part
due
to
the
lower
carbonation
distinct
rye
bread
aftertaste
after
a
bigger
quaff
overall
not
bad
a
warm
weather
beverage
to
pair
with
hearty
food
o
watery
but
still
almost
cloyingly
sweet
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
brown
plastic
1
liter
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
no
head
whatsoever
smell
is
rather
mild
some
molasses
taste
is
good
lots
of
dark
bread
some
molasses
a
touch
of
spice
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decnet
brew
this
one
also
evidenced
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
enough
to
produce
some
wisps
when
i
finished
the
pour
color
was
a
mahoganybrown
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
as
a
previous
reviewer
mentioned
very
bready
it
was
like
sniffing
a
dark
rye
bread
fresh
out
of
the
oven
along
with
notes
of
dried
dark
fruit
like
raisins
andor
prunes
mouthfeel
was
slightly
on
the
thin
side
not
quite
watery
but
close
the
taste
was
quite
unusual
with
an
initial
fruity
sourness
followed
by
a
caramel
sweetness
this
was
probably
as
close
to
liquid
bread
as
i
have
tried
thus
far
finish
lingered
with
the
caramel
sweetness
noted
in
the
mouth
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
one
of
the
better
kvasss
ive
had
with
a
deep
breadiness
balaced
nicely
by
yeasty
notes
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
addition
there
is
a
nice
carbonation
to
the
bottle
i
drank
it
starts
with
a
reasonable
head
that
fades
immediately
but
the
carbonation
stays
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
brown
with
a
touch
of
orange
smells
nicely
of
pumpernickel
bread
rye
honey
and
jammy
fruit
as
well
as
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
flavors
and
the
bready
notes
being
most
prominent
what
i
like
best
about
this
kvass
is
that
it
is
not
too
sour
and
not
too
sweet
i
also
like
the
yeastiness
and
the
nice
breadiness
too
it
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
very
unique
style
of
drink
the
first
time
i
tried
kvass
was
while
visiting
kyiv
ukraine
and
i
really
disliked
it
i
think
now
that
my
palate
has
become
accustomed
to
a
wide
variety
of
different
beers
i
can
appreciate
this
for
what
it
is
while
i
dont
see
myself
reaching
for
a
kvass
very
often
at
the
store
i
did
enjoy
this
and
would
have
more
in
the
future
tasty
flavorful
and
refreshingly
fruity
kvas
taras
is
unique
and
interesting
the
kvass
kick
is
back
in
gear
and
headed
back
into
ukraine
and
to
think
i
agreed
with
the
assessment
that
ukraine
was
weak
anyway
this
thing
pours
a
clear
russetgarnet
with
a
sad
excuse
for
a
dirty
white
head
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
wheat
sourdough
white
bread
yeah
i
said
it
this
is
really
bready
folks
wet
cardboard
and
fennel
its
nice
to
have
an
actually
breadysmelling
kvass
but
it
goes
too
far
with
the
idea
and
adds
some
slightly
unsavory
notes
to
boot
hrm
the
taste
hols
notes
of
fennel
rye
bread
raisins
red
grapes
the
small
ones
that
end
up
being
slightly
sour
when
you
bite
into
them
evoking
a
subdued
wince
and
a
strong
sense
of
disappointment
and
old
flat
root
beer
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
lightly
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
slightly
syrupy
feel
overall
i
was
decidedly
underwhelmed
with
this
kvass
especially
with
its
slightly
oddball
flavoring
i
mean
i
expect
a
mild
sourness
but
not
one
that
leans
toward
the
fruity
side
of
taste
right
right
overall
an
interesting
style
and
id
like
to
try
other
examples
on
the
sweet
side
so
not
something
id
want
to
session
but
once
in
a
while
itd
be
nice
i
assumed
it
was
merely
a
malt
beverage
until
i
looked
it
up
on
ba
so
im
a
bit
embarrassed
about
drinking
it
in
the
car
ride
home
overall
a
decent
middleoftheroad
kvass
could
be
a
little
less
sweet
im
starting
to
learn
that
prepackaged
kvass
is
all
pretty
much
similar
and
middleoftheroad
this
one
is
no
exception
not
a
bad
introduction
but
by
all
means
try
to
find
it
fresh
500ml
can
this
one
is
a
dark
brown
it
smells
like
sugar
and
more
sugar
the
flavor
is
the
same
even
sweeter
than
american
soda
i
would
say
just
cloyingly
sweet
100ml
is
more
than
enough
of
this
stuff
diabetes
in
a
can
this
one
is
just
waaay
tooo
sweet
for
me
overall
this
is
bad
news
you
can
tell
this
is
an
interesting
style
and
a
style
with
promise
but
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
it
taste
was
just
awful
i
tried
i
really
tried
too
much
of
a
nasty
bitterness
to
it
not
the
kind
you
get
from
hops
weird
sugarness
to
it
definitely
the
most
challenging
style
of
beer
ive
ever
had
but
this
tasted
nothing
like
any
kind
of
beer
ive
ever
had
predominant
raisin
and
rye
bread
aromas
maybe
a
little
nutty
walnut
at
times
lightly
tangy
and
sweet
almost
a
raisin
bread
soda
mildly
spicy
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
lingering
light
and
easily
quaffed
a
bit
too
sweet
to
really
have
a
bunch
though
overall
not
bad
nothing
groundbreaking
either
the
kvass
kick
rolls
on
this
offering
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
shortlived
wisp
of
a
head
this
thing
is
decidedly
lighter
in
color
than
any
other
kvass
up
to
this
point
not
sure
if
thats
good
or
not
the
nose
is
the
usual
though
comprising
maple
syrup
pumpernickel
and
brown
sugar
you
can
feel
the
sweetness
in
your
teeth
before
it
ever
enters
the
mouth
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
some
fennel
and
sugarcoated
walnuts
thrown
into
the
mix
i
like
this
seeming
addition
of
complexity
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
lightly
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
light
syrupy
feel
overall
a
sort
of
oddity
in
my
kick
very
sweet
and
bready
slightly
offputting
but
somehow
drinkable
nonetheless
the
usual
kvas
aroma
which
is
bready
but
also
a
tad
yeasty
this
one
light
brown
with
a
crowning
white
head
and
lacing
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
bit
above
average
mouthfeel
sweetcarmel
in
there
but
not
as
sweet
as
the
other
kvas
products
i
have
tried
being
of
lithuanian
decent
i
am
proud
to
say
this
has
been
the
best
of
several
kvas
products
picked
up
at
yummy
market
the
russian
supermarket
in
toronto
a
decent
choice
for
a
low
alcohol
beverage
