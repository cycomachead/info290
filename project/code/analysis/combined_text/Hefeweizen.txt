good
color
and
classic
smell
a
lovely
straw
yellow
hue
with
a
crazy
thick
head
that
sticks
around
for
an
extended
period
of
time
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
throughout
smells
yeasty
and
of
biscuit
tastes
refreshing
with
tons
of
banana
and
biscuity
flavor
little
notes
of
spice
as
well
a
tremendous
refreshing
hefe
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
style
clearly
wow
wow
wow
its
just
right
lets
compare
it
to
a
woman
she
goes
down
smooth
and
shes
the
perfect
mix
of
a
few
of
your
favorites
love
it
simply
the
best
hefe
ive
ever
had
the
standard
by
which
all
others
are
judged
enjoyed
many
times
over
the
years
in
various
glasses
always
a
pleasant
pour
with
a
frothy
head
rich
mouth
feel
with
medium
to
light
carbonation
notes
of
banana
and
spice
bottle
of
weihenstephaner
hefe
weizen
drank
its
a
great
beer
it
poured
beautifully
had
notes
of
ripen
bananas
and
fruity
esters
very
easy
to
drink
and
lightbodied
it
seems
to
be
missing
that
subtle
peppery
bite
that
i
look
for
in
a
hefeweizen
it
doesnt
compare
to
new
glarus
dancing
man
which
has
set
the
bar
really
high
it
might
be
that
this
beer
is
not
fresh
could
not
find
the
bottle
date
and
bought
this
off
a
shelf
at
room
temp
i
have
no
doubt
that
drinking
this
straight
from
the
source
or
from
a
fresh
bottle
would
leave
this
beer
tasting
much
better
than
now
i
will
take
the
next
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
again
when
i
find
it
refrigerated
not
sure
i
understand
the
fascination
with
this
beer
im
not
a
hop
snob
and
appreciate
czech
and
german
pilsners
and
lagers
and
enjoy
hefe
weisbiers
as
well
who
knows
maybe
the
main
streamers
who
put
a
lemon
wedge
in
this
stuff
are
right
think
it
would
help
i
cant
deny
how
good
this
is
they
hit
it
right
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
perfect
amount
of
banana
flavors
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
smell
gets
a
4
but
who
cares
about
that
everything
else
is
a
5
i
still
enjoy
many
other
hefeweizens
but
this
one
truly
is
that
extra
bit
better
than
all
the
others
i
have
had
fantastic
beer
great
beer
id
drink
this
any
day
love
wheat
beer
this
is
a
great
one
rich
and
spicy
clove
notes
blend
with
pleasantly
balanced
fruity
esters
perfect
body
incredibly
drinkable
and
refreshing
simply
the
definition
of
the
style
purchased
500
ml
bottle
from
the
health
food
store
for
about
3
and
poured
into
a
tall
beer
glass
a
very
hazy
rich
goldenyellow
color
with
a
fluffy
pure
white
head
that
slowly
fades
leaving
slight
lacing
aroma
is
of
bread
yeast
and
slight
citrus
taste
is
really
nice
with
some
citrus
and
bread
followed
by
a
muted
cinnamonnutmeglike
spiciness
that
really
makes
the
beer
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pint
the
beer
started
to
have
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
maybe
due
to
the
trip
across
the
atlantic
goes
down
really
easy
but
is
not
super
thin
enough
body
to
keep
you
from
pounding
it
but
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
refreshing
overall
a
fantastic
wheat
beer
and
a
great
deal
for
the
price
i
love
hefeweizens
but
im
not
sure
i
understand
the
super
high
rating
on
this
one
i
cant
really
tell
this
difference
between
weihenstephaner
hackerpschorr
paulaner
or
tucher
they
all
seem
equally
delicious
while
i
love
the
style
this
particular
brew
does
not
stand
out
from
the
crowd
overall
a
4
75
for
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
bayerische
staatsbrauerei
weihenstephan
not
quite
perfect
for
a
5
but
this
is
up
there
fellow
bas
and
also
those
new
to
this
whod
like
something
lighter
on
the
palate
yet
still
bursting
with
great
flavor
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beer
to
begin
with
i
must
say
that
i
had
better
of
this
style
still
drinkable
and
refreshing
its
a
different
hefeweissen
beer
very
bready
good
head
fantastic
flavor
overall
i
can
see
why
this
brewery
has
been
around
for
so
long
all
the
components
of
this
beer
are
bold
but
well
blended
i
usually
get
bored
of
hefes
before
finishing
12
onces
this
one
left
me
wanting
another
16
about
perfect
for
the
style
lots
of
earthy
hay
on
the
nose
grainy
malt
flavor
that
is
light
and
crisp
a
standard
of
thr
style
a
solid
german
hefeweizen
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tasted
this
beer
is
the
standard
for
hefe
weissbiers
and
is
world
class
the
flavor
profile
is
intense
complex
and
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
mild
tartness
that
separates
into
lemon
and
banana
as
these
fade
in
the
middle
clove
comes
forward
over
a
biscuit
background
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
dryness
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
mild
biscuit
fading
and
leaving
clove
very
good
hefe
i
really
enjoyed
lots
of
bananas
imo
i
actually
prefer
the
paulaner
hefe
over
this
one
at
the
moment
but
it
is
very
good
tried
this
on
tap
was
very
good
and
actually
very
cheap
i
had
forgotten
my
growler
or
this
would
have
been
the
beer
i
bought
beer
lived
up
to
its
name
for
me
great
summer
beer
and
german
beer
example
a
great
day
bier
from
the
original
bier
maker
simply
the
best
in
class
subpar
compared
to
the
excellent
dunkel
on
tap
perfect
to
style
just
delish
worth
trying
more
than
once
i
may
not
be
rating
this
as
high
as
most
people
on
here
but
that
definitely
does
not
mean
i
dislike
this
good
beer
all
around

with
some
bitter

towards
the
end
definitely
could
tell
it
was
an
ancient
recipe
i
loved
the
look
of
it
had
a
nice
dark
to
light
gradient
and
feel
was
solid
nice
medium
body
but
the
taste
and
smell
was
not
pleasing
to
me
had
a
weird
barley
bacterial
taste
exactly
what
i
expect
in
a
german
style
hefeweizen
just
a
normal
hefeweizen
beer
i
really
dont
get
why
people
love
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
hefeweiss
beers
ive
had
high
quality
and
smooth
drinking
with
the
absolute
perfect
balance
of
spice
and
malt
this
beer
would
be
outstanding
had
it
been
a
little
cooler
smooth
with
a
nice
fruity
finish
i
would
def
buy
again
top
notch
wow
all
the
garbage
thats
labeled
hefeweizen
in
the
us
does
not
even
come
close
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
pours
a
cloudy
orange
bubbly
awesome
head
smells
malty
and
sweet
maybe
banana
just
enough
sweet
and
spice
beautifully
balanced
beer
never
had
such
a
pleasant
experience
with
a
hefeweizen
what
can
i
say
that
isnt
already
known
about
this
beer
this
is
the
ultimate
form
thanks

hefeweissbier
45
i
am
new
to
this
but
wonder
if
i
just
got
a
bad
one
loved
the
kristallweiss
that
i
had
a
couple
of
days
ago
but
was
not
as
impressed
by
this
one
will
have
to
try
it
again
wish
i
could
find
some
sort
of
date
on
the
bottle
smell
and
taste
of
lager
flavours
bready
wheat
slight
citrusberry
with
a
tinge
of
earthiness
smooth
creamy
yeasty
and
crisp
this
has
it
all
my
absolute
favourite
hefeweiss
bier
along
with
their
dunkel
pretty
good
beer
to
tacos
will
buy
again
soon
very
soon
deliciously
made
and
well
crafted
beer
with
a
subtle
hint
of
banana
flavor
this
is
the
first
german
beer
i
have
tried
and
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
now
i
underatand
why
they
say
germany
makes
the
best
beer
i
recently
turned
21
and
started
trying
different
types
of
beer
to
find
what
i
like
and
well
this
is
a
winner
poured
cloudy
with
a
orange
hue
low
head
and
retention
probably
not
a
wellcleaned
glass
i
get
some
of
the
banana
esters
i
was
expecting
but
not
too
much
closest
smell
i
can
think
of
is
canned
corn
taste
is
where
this
brew
moves
up
a
notch
fullflavored
hefe
with
better
mouthfeel
than
most
nice
finish
as
well
pretty
much
a
goto
hefe
and
the
decision
is
even
easier
considering
how
reasonably
priced
this
usually
is
this
is
flat
out
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
so
i
am
a
little
biased
when
it
comes
to
hefeweizen
i
feel
this
is
one
that
others
should
be
compared
to
great
body
aroma
and
flavor
top
of
the
class
this
tastes
like
a
german
biergraden
its
top
notch
and
arguably
the
best
of
its
style
plus
relatively
easy
to
find
at
my
local
specialty
grocer
overall
one
of
my
top
5
beers
now
seriously
amazing
nice
hazy
appearance
not
sure
how
to
describe
the
smell
on
this
one
predominant
banana
flavor
nice
light
body
best
hef
in
recent
memory
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
best
beer
in
the
world
if
i
could
only
drink
one
brand
the
rest
of
my
life
this
is
it
best
weiss
beer
ever
glad
my
girl
liked
it
too
pours
beautifully
murky
orange
hue
with
a
thick
head
smells
perfectly
banana
malt
clove
taste
perfect
mouthfeel
same
enough
said
a
quality
hefe
lacks
a
bit
of
the
yeast
flavor
the
banana
comes
through
i
would
drink
it
again
absolutely
amazing
hefeweiss
beautiful
hazy
shade
of
straw
with
hints
of
orange
in
a
classic
weihenstephaner
pint
glass
with
a
nice
layer
of
creamy
head
on
top
taste
is
as
good
as
it
gets
in
my
opinion
creamy
sweet
but
not
too
much
fortunately
and
overall
just
amazing
drank
a
few
at
prater
biergarten
while
on
my
trip
to
berlin
and
just
the
great
memories
of
weihenstephaner
together
with
some
nice
bratwurst
make
me
want
to
go
back
very
good
beer
my
favorite
by
far
at
the
moment
perfect
weissbeer
couldnt
been
better
nice
clove
flavor
not
over
the
top
excellent
texture
light
citrus
for
a
refreshing
brew
the
origin
of
beer
still
going
strong
one
of
the
best
beers
i
ve
had
this
is
so
drinkable
i
feel
i
could
have
like
three
of
these
in
a
row
crisp
and
refreshing
will
have
again
and
again
and
again
my
example
of
the
perfect
beer
an
exceptional
balance
of
bavarian
hefe
flavors
and
smoothness
this
is
where
the
bar
is
set
for
bavarianstyle
hefeweizen
overall
this
is
a
very
good
hefeweizen
not
quite
as
good
as
a
franziskaner
in
my
opinion
but
definitely
up
there
amazing
wheat
beer
probably
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
tried
the
gold
standard
for
hefes
tough
to
beat
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
of
the
most
balanced
and
rich
hefeweizen
must
try
possibly
my
favorite
beer
it
goes
down
so
easy
love
in
a
glass
very
good
beer
flavourful
not
too
heavy
good
mouthfeel
overall
excellent
weissbier
theres
a
reason
this
is
the
highest
rated
hefeweizen
its
amazingly
balanced
this
is
my
go
to
beer
especially
in
the
summer
an
exceptional
brew
best
ever
hefeweizen
poured
into
a
halfliter
weissbier
glass
produced
a
nice
3finger
fluffy
white
head
very
persistent
the
head
lasted
a
good
five
minutes
and
left
some
very
nice
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
golden
yellow
color
thick
and
hazy
just
as
a
good
hefeweizen
should
look
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
huge
with
wheat
cloves
malt
some
light
citrus
and
just
a
hint
of
banana
the
clove
flavors
really
shine
in
the
taste
along
with
some
nice
citrusy
notes
and
banana
with
a
very
nice
sweet
malty
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
medium
bodied
creamy
smooth
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
the
high
carbonation
adding
just
the
perfect
finish
on
the
back
of
the
palate
this
hefe
is
the
standard
against
which
all
other
hefes
should
be
measured
a
worldclass
beer
at
such
an
outstanding
price
i
paid
about
a
dollar
each
outstanding
beer
at
a
superlow
price
sign
me
up
i
honestly
cant
believe
i
passed
this
beer
over
based
on
price
point
for
several
years
4
a
pint
bottle
in
washington
state
glorious
head
that
shadows
a
variable
fruit
flavored
offering
i
got
green
apple
green
banana
pink
grapefruitlemon
champagne
bubbly
finish
must
try
o
i
really
like
the
malty
finish
like
most
wheats
taste
seems
slightly
on
the
light
side
for
me
but
it
still
a
very
pleasant
taste
o
imo
the
best
damn
hefeweizen
i
ever
had
this
stuff
is
true
magic
and
a
great
credit
to
the
worlds
oldest
brewing
company
i
guess
after
nearly
a
thousand
years
though
it
should
be
expected
traditional
and
a
must
for
beer
fans
o
obviously
one
of
the
gold
standards
of
the
weissbier
style
and
i
would
love
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
on
a
warm
sunny
spring
or
summer
day
an
easy
goto
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
i
have
had
to
date
a
good
mixture
of
flavours
from
the
hefe
spectrum
a
wellrounded
beer
and
decent
for
an
equivalent
of
au65
for
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
what
can
i
say
the
germans
do
it
best
by
far
my
favorite
beer
ive
ignored
the
fact
that
my
local
chain
grocer
offers
this
for
years
now
that
ive
tried
it
i
cant
imagine
why
i
put
it
off
for
so
long
an
excellent
hefeweizen
at
an
excellent
price
golden
pour
with
slight
haze
touch
of
orange
in
the
aroma
light
hops
with
a
creamy
orange
finish
i
cant
decide
if
i
like
this
or
the
paulaner
version
better
both
are
fantastic
but
this
one
comes
in
a
bigger
bottle
a
straightforward
delicious
elegant
classic
example
of
a
hefeweiss
difficult
to
find
any
flaw
just
a
bottle
of
goodness
o
very
good
hehe
very
easy
to
drink
great
overall
beer
ookay
this
beer
is
very
dependent
on
method
of
delivery
and
temperature
crisp
and
drinkable
i
dont
drink
this
style
of
beer
very
often
but
this
is
good
easily
best
in
style
around
serving

the

cant
beat
that
first
beer
on
the
native
soil
of
germany
was
this
delicious
delight
perfect
blends
and
crisp
taste
overall
this
is
more
than
just
a
standard
for
a
hefeweizen
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
end
all
and
be
all
of
hefeweizens
overall
after
being
disappointed
by
kellerweiss
i
was
willing
to
give
hefeweizens
one
more
shot
with
what
is
arguably
the
benchmark
of
the
style
but
sadly
ended
up
getting
disappointed
once
more
i
understand
that
it
is
intended
for
the
yeasts
to
give
off
a
flavor
similar
to
this
and
that
many
other
people
enjoy
it
but
it
is
just
not
for
me
and
i
think
its
only
fair
for
my
score
to
reflect
my
own
experience
with
the
beer
i
guess
im
one
of
those
people
who
are
too
sensitive
to
the
yeastsphenols
for
this
kind
of
beer
to
be
enjoyable
for
now
i
will
give
up
on
this
style
or
maybe
try
a
kristalweizen
next
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
the
head
is
thick
and
lasts
for
several
minutes
although
it
is
rather
expensive
17
for
a
pint
on
tap
or
around
13
for
a
6pack
it
is
well
worth
the
price
drunk
loads
and
loads
of
these
from
the
barrel
absolutely
my
favorite
all
time
beer
never
bores
fresh
banana
like
taste
solid
head
just
perfect
4250
enjoy
one
of
the
best
hefes
out
there
very
drinkable
and
good
notes
of
banana
glass
traditional
wheat
glass
classic
hefeweizen
that
does
exactly
what
it
should
really
lovely
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
my
favorite
hefeweizen
smooth
drinking
with
a
superb
banana
finish
im
new
to
beer
reviewing
so
beer
with
me
lol
a
golden
yellow
slightly
cloudy
with
a
big
white
creamy
head
that
offers
nice
lacing
while
drinking
n
the
aroma
is
an
excellent
balance
of
hops
and
fruit
that
leaves
your
mouth
asking
for
more
t
wheat
malts
tropic
fruits
light
spices
quite
dry
and
hoppy
p
doesnt
leave
much
behind
on
the
palate
but
is
nicely
carbonated
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
it
was
refreshing
and
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
hefeweizen
it
is
a
very
good
after
dinner
beer
due
to
not
being
filling
or
heavy
a
must
have
if
you
enjoy
wheat
beers
medium
full
body
and
very
effervescent
like
this
very
much
overall
an
outstanding
beer
that
delivers
on
all
fronts
and
does
not
disappoint
easy
drinking
complex
enough
to
warrant
attention
but
not
so
complex
as
to
be
confusing
except
for
the
banana
coming
to
the
front
once
in
a
while
i
didnt
think
any
flavor
was
particularly
dominant
all
of
the
flavors
were
balanced
and
smooth
contributing
to
the
overall
flavor
without
being
over
the
top
great
brew
o
very
refreshing
beer
reflects
the
style
very
nicely
would
gladly
order
this
beer
again
although
i
think
i
will
try
ordering
a
bottle
next
time
in
order
to
have
a
better
head
on
the
beer
45
the
only
thing
you
need
to
know
about
weihenstephaner
is
that
its
the
most
important
beer
on
this
planet
this
is
what
all
wheat
beers
will
inspire
to
be
until
the
end
of
time
surprisingly
complex
for
a
german
wheatothers
ive
had
tend
to
rely
more
on
sweetness
and
smoothness
while
this
one
punctuates
the
flavor
with
peppery
and
bitter
qualities
that
give
it
a
more
mature
character
i
appreciate
that
the
balance
is
towards
the
spicy
qualities
with
fruity
sweetness
in
support
and
that
the
otherwise
sour
yeastiness
is
effectively
masked
love
this
kind
of
beer
hefeweisen
is
my
2nd
favorite
lot
of
banana
and
bubblegum
type
aromas
with
a
big
peppery
lime
and
citrus
peel
bite
on
the
palate
load
of
carbonation
with
clean
finish
very
intensely
flavored
without
overpowering
and
burning
the
palate
poured
from
pint
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
3
finger
foam
head
of
an
off
white
color
ok
lacing
smells
of
wheat
clove
and
bananas
with
hints
of
lemon
and
vanilla
tastes
a
lot
like
banana
with
a
slightly
vanillaish
after
taste
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
that
ive
had
to
date
prost
so
good
had
it
in
new
york
at
an
irish
pub
very
smooth
and
crisp
huge
great
banana
and
clove
flavor
in
this
one
a
little
more
subdued
on
the
clove
than
other
hefeweizens
ive
had
but
it
is
still
there
overall
the
best
hefe
ive
had
so
far
this
beer
is
just
so
smooth
tasty
and
drinkable
that
i
found
myself
polishing
it
off
in
no
time
i
kept
sniffing
at
it
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
in
between
sips
and
then
lingering
over
the
sips
so
as
to
prolong
the
enjoyment
of
the
sip
i
could
sit
and
drink
10
of
these
and
probably
still
want
more
for
a
hot
summers
day
youll
find
it
difficult
to
find
a
better
beer
alternating
in
rounds
between
this
and
the
rothaus
pils
would
probably
be
close
to
nirvana
actually
i
can
see
a
vitus
looking
longingly
out
of
the
fridge
o
good
stuff
and
i
havent
revisited
this
one
in
years
but
i
also
had
the
vitus
recently
and
i
prefer
that
inezs
intensity
of
flavor
would
absolutely
seek
out
and
purchase
again
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
its
pricey
but
worth
it
sao
paulo
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
with
thick
head
and
moderate
lacing
smell
is
of
umami
bananas
cloves
fruity
pebbles
taste
is
alternatively
umami
like
soy
sauce
and
fruity
with
bananas
and
cloves
coming
through
there
is
a
bready
wheaty
backbone
that
ties
the
flavors
together
very
smooth
and
low
in
bitterness
this
beer
is
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
overall
the
archetypal
hefeweizen
this
is
the
standard
all
other
wheat
beers
are
to
be
judged
by
overall
a
clearly
well
crafted
and
delicious
hefeweizen
o
boy
is
it
good
loads
and
loads
of
wheat
sweetness
with
just
enough
of
a
tart
note
to
keep
it
from
becoming
too
sweet
a
brew
i
will
revisit
over
and
over
and
a
definite
standard
i
will
use
to
measure
other
hefeweizens
gold
clear
yellow
white
long
lasting
head
thick
and
tasty
smells
like
rum
from
barrels
vanilla
at
first
and
wheat
and
fruits
later
lots
of
hops
cigars
and
tobacco
sweetness
of
grains
bitterness
of
yeast
cinnamon
barley
avocado
all
in
finish
gold
medal
and
probably
best
wheat
beer
in
the
world
the
quintessential
german
hef
strong
head
on
the
pour
due
to
the
intense
carbonation
the
head
levels
off
nicely
after
about
5
min
clear
golden
straw
color
intense
banana
clove
smell
that
carries
over
perfectly
to
the
taste
clean
crisp
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
refreshing
the
perfect
beer
when
you
are
hangin
on
the
porch
on
a
lazy
85
degree
summer
afternoon
truly
outstanding
atv0518
one
of
the
great
weissbiers
of
the
world
the
import
is
filtered
more
than
what
you
would
drink
in
freising
germany
but
it
is
very
smooth
and
very
pleasing
it
has
more
body
than
spaten
and
is
more
wheaty
than
rhineland
lagers
this
is
the
beer
of
bavaria
o
not
a
huge
hefeweizen
drinker
but
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
great
for
warm
weather
or
if
you
are
on
the
mood
for
a
nice
lighter
bodies
beer
absolutely
fantastic
overall
great
beer
and
certainly
one
of
if
not
the
best
hefes
ive
tried
so
far
the
vanilla
creaminess
aspect
definitely
separates
this
from
the
pack
95100
overall
just
absolutely
solid
very
nice
for
a
lighter
beer
complex
while
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
im
a
little
spoiled
since
i
live
in
austin
and
we
can
get
live
oak
hefeweizen
on
tap
in
a
lot
of
places
here
so
i
was
a
little
hesitant
to
buy
this
one
but
i
wanted
a
hefe
and
the
guy
at
specs
said
this
is
the
best
they
have
i
still
like
live
oak
better
but
just
by
a
hair
i
have
seen
a
number
of
reviews
that
rated
this
beer
down
a
bit
and
i
would
say
that
something
you
might
do
is
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
i
started
this
one
at
fridge
temp
and
wasnt
really
that
impressed
at
first
however
i
was
called
away
for
a
bit
and
when
i
came
back
the
beer
had
warmed
up
to
probably
upper
forties
or
even
higher
in
temp
and
it
was
amazing
it
really
opened
up
and
a
lot
of
flavor
came
out
i
tried
to
like
this
beer
but
there
is
just
nothing
special
here
it
may
be
the
best
hefe
made
but
that
makes
it
the
king
of
a
pretty
tiny
hill
overall
really
excellent
beer
i
have
only
been
rating
beers
a
few
months
but
this
one
is
my
favorite
so
far
if
you
want
a
good
wheat
beer
you
should
give
this
one
a
try
i
see
how
this
is
the
standard
for
a
hefe
pours
pale
orange
with
moderate
head
and
quickly
receding
lace
patterns
aroma
is
truly
outstanding
orange
banana
and
great
wheat
aromas
very
well
balanced
taste
follows
with
cloves
grass
and
slightly
sour
yeast
flavors
very
smooth
finish
and
great
after
taste
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
significant
fluffy
white
head
that
just
kept
going
and
going
which
hinted
at
bottle
conditioning
the
aroma
was
classic
hefe
with
the
clove
spice
and
banana
yeast
the
taste
followed
with
the
full
bodied
banana
yeast
and
spices
floating
on
top
of
a
grainy
wheat
base
there
was
practically
no
perceptible
bitterness
to
be
found
just
hefe
heaven
the
mouthfeel
had
a
perfect
amount
of
body
and
thickness
to
be
a
substantial
and
satisfying
drink
despite
the
fullness
i
found
the
beer
to
be
refreshing
while
not
sacrificing
the
full
flavor
of
the
hefeweizen
the
weihenstephaner
really
nails
the
style
a
perfect
hefe
refreshing
with
flavors
that
complement
any
wellseasoned
foods
probably
the
first
choice
if
you
are
eating
thai
or
indian
cuisine
they
have
succeeded
in
drawing
the
most
from
the
wheat
base
and
flavoring
cautiously
tops
any
u
s
craft
wheat
beer
i
have
tasted
purchased
at
total
wine
in
naples
fl
for
9
99
for
6pk
o
great
session
beer
for
any
time
of
year
especially
in
the
fall
definitely
recommended
just
a
really
tasty
bready
beer
with
some
added
complexities
that
most
beers
this
light
dont
possess
pours
a
nice
yelloworange
beer
has
a
nice
foamy
head
almost
no
smell
except
for
yeast
and
maybe
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
straightforward
classic
very
well
executed
it
does
not
need
to
do
anything
crazy
it
is
very
well
balanced
a
classic
hefeweizen
nice
cloudy
and
light
color
with
a
wheat
aroma
and
characteristic
bananasweet
background
the
taste
was
great
clearly
a
wheat
beer
with
earthy
tones
like
cloves
but
a
prominent
banana
flavor
throughout
creating
a
sense
of
creaminess
and
faux
full
body
despite
being
light
and
quite
drinkable
i
enjoy
heavier
full
beers
so
the
feel
was
a
bit
too
light
and
watery
to
me
overall
excellent
hefeweizen
not
too
much
banana
but
a
light
wheat
beer
with
the
enjoyable
bananaearthiness
from
the
unique
yeast
o
a
classic
beer
and
rightfully
so
loaded
with
flavour
yet
very
drinkable
i
used
to
not
think
too
much
of
hefeweizens
but
every
time
i
have
this
one
i
love
the
style
more
and
more
try
this
if
you
havent
already
flavor
banana
right
up
front
then
more
banana
wheat
of
course
very
drinkable
o
4
25
great
beer
and
probably
the
best
of
the
style
but
also
quite
the
departure
from
others
in
the
same
family
o
this
represents
what
a
golden
wheat
beer
can
be
versus
the
disappointment
i
find
more
frequently
this
is
an
excellent
beer
great
execution
surprisingly
tasty
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
sweet
enough
to
make
you
want
more
but
not
cloying
the
flavor
is
subdued
enough
to
make
you
keep
coming
back
an
excellent
hefeweissbier
unbelievable
amazingly
good
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
thick
fizzy
head
that
trails
the
head
the
smell
is
heavy
with
wheat
that
brings
to
mind
bananas
and
really
fresh
bread
the
taste
was
exceptional
with
sweetness
in
the
beginning
that
turns
to
the
almost
minty
spice
of
the
wheat
the
feel
was
amazingly
refreshing
for
being
thick
and
just
full
of
flavor
probably
my
favorite
import
and
can
not
recommend
it
highly
enough
overall
this
has
to
be
the
perfect
summer
beer
beer
has
great
carbonation
and
tastes
amazing
the
best
weissbier
there
is
great
smooth
taste
this
beer
was
recommended
by
the
manager
at
the
liquor
kappys
he
was
right
on
point
with
this
one
golden
look
to
it
nice
wheat
taste
not
hoppy
so
dont
have
a
hoppy
beer
while
drinking
this
beer
it
will
take
away
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
the
look
of
this
beer
is
phenomenal
i
recommend
pouring
slowly
23s
or
more
of
the
bottle
and
then
spin
the
rest
of
the
liquid
in
the
bottle
before
pouring
in
the
remainder
this
will
complete
the
look
and
taste
by
adding
what
some
refer
to
as
the
crud
if
you
ever
see
this
on
tap
get
it
and
take
pics
for
the
masses
overall
when
reviewing
wheat
beers
many
of
us
on
here
including
myself
mention
that
its
not
our
style
but
this
is
one
of
my
very
few
exceptions
truly
an
amazing
hefe
and
you
dont
even
have
to
seek
it
out
therefore
this
is
the
only
hefe
worth
buying
in
my
opinion
beats
others
in
the
style
bavarian
or
not
at
a
competitive
price
point
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
make
you
look
forward
to
summer
the
ratings
say
it
all
cheers
wow
what
a
great
beer
i
could
drink
this
every
day
top
of
the
line
when
it
comes
to
german
wheat
beers
a
beautiful
golden
color
and
thick
white
head
brings
a
fabulous
aroma
of
wheat
and
banana
a
very
light
body
makes
for
a
great
drink
at
any
time
of
the
year
if
you
havent
experienced
this
beer
go
out
and
find
it
as
soon
as
you
can
othe
best
hefeweizen
a
beer
in
which
i
can
think
of
no
area
to
improve
in
in
fact
stop
reading
as
ill
stop
reviewing
and
lets
drink
us
some
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
overall
buy
it
or
try
it
you
will
love
it
best
hefe
to
date
i
have
had
this
brew
many
times
and
will
buy
it
till
i
cant
buy
it
no
more
the
more
you
try
the
hefe
style
it
will
grow
on
you
i
did
not
like
it
at
first
but
it
has
a
way
of
calling
your
name
overall
not
my
style
but
this
drinks
nicely
a
great
goto
beer
that
can
be
found
everywhere
what
a
wonderful
hefeweissen
lovely
soft
citrus
aromas
pours
a
warm
golden
with
a
pillowy
head
tastes
like
fruit
and
bread
and
sunshine
i
didnt
discern
any
dryness
or
hoppiness
but
the
beer
tastes
very
smooth
wellbalanced
drinkable
and
flavorfull
unlike
some
other
hefeweissens
i
wasnt
put
off
by
any
excessive
sweetness
or
carbonation
allaround
great
beer
we
sampled
the
brewerys
hefe
weissbier
hw
in
a
500
ml
bottle
purchased
from
the
lcbo
with
a
best
before
date
of
september
9
2012
hw
was
5
4
alcohol
by
volume
it
poured
a
naturally
cloudy
light
orange
colour
with
about
2
of
fluffy
white
long
lasting
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
and
spotting
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
fabulous
bananas
cloves
and
yeast
and
remember
that
this
is
a
beer
that
complies
with
the
bavarian
purity
law
and
therefore
contains
no
bananas
or
cloves
darn
clever
the
things
those
germans
can
do
with
the
right
strain
of
yeast
the
taste
very
much
followed
the
aroma
with
bananas
cloves
wheat
and
yeast
evident
the
amount
of
carbonation
was
just
right
with
lots
of
small
bubbles
on
the
tongue
and
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
hw
also
had
the
clean
finish
i
look
for
in
my
favourite
beers
ladies
and
gentlemen
if
this
isnt
the
epitome
of
the
brewers
art
it
has
to
be
close
at
3
05
per
500
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
a
decent
value
for
money
as
well
and
hw
now
joins
my
short
list
of
regular
purchases
50cl
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
cloudy
pale
gold
appearance
with
a
thick
three
finger
white
head
sweet
banana
aroma
with
yeast
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
taste
of
banana
and
bubblegum
dry
bready
aftertaste
medium
body
and
carbonation
a
very
good
hefeweizen
would
be
perfect
with
bratwurst
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
wonderful
beer
that
is
my
go
to
wherever
i
can
find
it
if
youre
in
buffalo
the
blue
monk
on
elmwood
actually
has
a
keg
for
this
specifically
every
night
i
didnt
know
about
all
the
hype
before
i
tasted
it
but
i
think
that
makes
my
review
more
honest
it
really
is
that
good
overall
ive
heard
nothing
but
great
things
about
this
beer
and
finally
gave
it
a
try
this
is
truly
a
perfect
beer
definitely
a
benchmark
for
its
style
and
pretty
accessible
a
must
try
i
cant
count
how
many
times
ive
had
this
beer
and
finally
am
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
the
perfect
hefeweiss
possibly
my
favorite
almost
certainly
o
by
far
the
best
hefeweizen
ive
had
it
is
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
with
the
smell
and
flavor
just
melding
together
only
hefe
id
choose
to
drink
again
as
i
said
not
my
favorite
style
giving
the
overall
a
boost
for
being
the
best
of
in
a
style
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
in
ample
supply
o
an
excellent
beer
for
sure
havent
had
it
in
a
while
glad
i
picked
it
up
again
because
ill
definitely
be
getting
this
on
a
regular
basis
mouthfeel
bubbly
but
not
over
powering
crisp
beginning
and
a
slight
aftertaste
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
an
afternoon
bbq
or
similar
event
oclassic
example
of
style
perfect
beer
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
have
this
beer
overall
a
fantastic
beer
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
was
my
first
hefeweizen
and
to
this
day
my
favorite
certainly
overall
this
is
my
favorite
hefe
no
adding
a
lemon
to
this
one
boys
and
girls
o
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
it
just
doesnt
appeal
to
me
maybe
when
i
grow
up
i
will
like
it
at
this
point
i
wouldnt
seek
this
style
out
again
this
beer
serves
well
as
a
transition
from
work
into
a
late
afternoon
of
relaxation
it
is
especially
wellsuited
to
a
cool
cloudless
blue
friday
with
light
rustling
wind
o
flawless
my
description
doesnt
make
it
look
like
the
most
intense
beer
ever
and
its
not
however
this
is
a
perfect
hefe
a
perfect
beer
in
my
opinion
its
clean
balanced
flavorful
and
pretty
to
look
at
500ml
weizen
glass
i
had
previously
had
this
bottled
but
the
on
tap
version
was
spectacular
the
only
thing
i
could
complain
about
would
be
the
price
but
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
to
a
wheat
beer
lover
like
myself
it
was
worth
a
few
extra
shekels
i
would
order
this
anytime
and
anywhere
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
satisfying
while
somehow
still
light
and
airy
overall
excellent
beer
o
beautiful
appearance
great
carbonation
and
bananas
throughout
love
it
looking
forward
to
enjoying
weizens
this
coming
spring
and
summer
its
a
nice
beer
but
not
really
what
i
expected
opinion
i
feel
kind
of
let
down
with
this
id
think
for
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
that
the
recipe
would
be
extraordinary
but
this
was
middle
of
the
road
for
a
hefe
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
prefer
ayinger
to
this
no
beer
is
perfect
otherwise
every
other
company
would
just
copy
their
recipe
this
has
to
be
the
closest
thing
to
perfect
if
you
want
a
nice
bavarian
german
beer
weihenstephaner
is
the
way
to
go
their
hefeweissbier
is
incredible
i
have
definitely
not
tasted
anything
close
to
the
quality
of
this
beer
ive
not
had
many
european
hefeweizens
but
this
one
is
easily
the
best
so
far
very
well
balanced
and
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
ever
had
i
cant
believe
how
many
times
i
looked
at
this
on
the
shelf
before
finally
trying
it
i
have
a
whole
new
appreciation
for
the
style
and
this
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
pours
a
hazy
yellowgold
in
color
with
a
good
3finger
white
head
that
does
settle
down
to
about
12
a
finger
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
sweet
right
up
front
with
wheat
and
cloves
the
taste
is
real
close
to
that
with
the
slight
tangy
clove
finish
clean
and
crisp
and
goes
down
very
easy
no
bitter
or
harsh
after
taste
at
all
very
slightly
dry
at
the
end
overall
really
a
great
brew
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
wheat
type
beers
my
first
experience
with
weihenstephaner
had
me
instantly
hooked
one
sip
and
i
knew
this
is
is
bottom
line
if
you
like
wheat
beer
this
should
be
your
next
purchase
you
cant
go
wrong
pours
a
hazy
yellowgold
color
with
a
large
frothy
pure
white
head
fueled
by
a
continuous
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
base
of
the
glass
wet
patches
of
bubbles
cling
to
the
walls
of
the
tulip
the
aroma
is
of
strong
clove
banana
wheat
straw
freshly
cut
grass
and
hay
very
floral
and
refreshing
the
taste
follow
suits
with
a
strong
clove
and
banana
presence
amongst
a
wheat
and
hay
background
some
faint
lemon
citrus
white
pepper
and
crisp
grape
juice
sensation
round
it
out
mouthfeel
is
delectable
light
crisp
and
lively
with
an
effervescent
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
hefeweissbier
that
im
always
happy
to
have
the
clove
in
this
is
very
predominant
but
masterfully
integrated
such
that
it
doesnt
seem
overpowering
mb
if
this
beer
was
a
friend
it
would
be
the
one
you
choose
to
spend
the
majority
of
your
free
time
with
overall
german
perfection
an
excellent
beer
easydrinking
and
refreshing
and
very
approachable
wonderful
beer
that
i
could
drink
over
and
over
again
the
sweet
is
cut
by
that
wonderful
spicing
on
the
nose
and
palate
and
that
wheat
base
is
amazing
world
class
no
doubt
o
it
loves
up
to
the
hype
a
must
have
for
the
style
translucent
but
not
transparent
this
hefe
weissbier
or
yeast
wheat
beer
pours
yellow
yes
yellow
in
color
unfiltered
bursting
with
carbonation
leaving
rings
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
is
one
of
the
best
wheats
ever
made
not
only
is
it
the
best
but
it
a
the
first
claiming
that
it
was
first
brewed
in
1040
ad
fragrant
citrus
bouquet
carbonated
not
bitter
citrusy
wheat
taste
on
the
palate
that
lingers
as
a
slightly
sweet
beer
possibly
floral
at
the
finish
the
best
lingering
flavor
for
a
wheat
ive
ever
tasted
true
bavarian
munich
region
beer
not
hard
to
find
but
dont
underestimate
its
greatness
o
4
5
its
a
great
beer
world
class
for
sure
this
is
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
had
usually
they
have
some
off
flavors
but
this
one
was
so
clean
and
awesome
o
best
hefe
ive
ever
had
i
dont
think
the
usa
has
mastered
this
style
yet
like
the
german
brewers
have
yet
o
an
exceptionally
crisp
and
clean
refreshing
whit
would
definitely
seek
out
again
for
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
patio
arguably
the
best
hefeweizen
in
the
world
this
beer
is
readily
available
and
affordable
where
i
live
i
would
not
worry
too
much
about
the
freshness
factor
as
this
beer
ages
remarkably
well
for
the
style
i
have
had
it
on
tap
both
in
germany
and
the
u
s
and
have
had
many
bottles
in
the
u
s
never
a
let
down
the
darker
and
stronger
versions
are
also
great
as
are
the
lagers
from
this
masterful
brewery
on
the
whole
this
is
truly
deserving
of
its
place
among
the
top
250
while
wits
and
hefes
may
never
be
my
favorite
style
i
can
absolutely
understand
the
praise
for
this
particular
one
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
to
all
that
love
hefewit
beers
you
cant
go
wrong
with
was
is
so
right
highly
recommend
if
you
like
wheathefeweizen
beer
this
is
exactly
what
you
need
o
its
no
wonder
this
beer
is
rated
so
highly
its
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
definitely
the
best
hefe
ive
had
its
a
stark
difference
from
the
last
hefe
i
had
which
i
think
was
a
widmer
almost
a
year
ago
its
just
no
comparison
they
are
two
totally
different
beasts
the
weihenstephaner
was
a
flavor
bomb
and
now
i
wish
i
had
another
to
drink
overall
an
excellent
mediumbodied
almost
sweet
beer
highly
recommended
othis
was
a
smooth
beer
that
was
very
refreshing
it
had
taste
and
flavor
and
i
will
be
drinking
it
again
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
a
standard
go
to
smell
and
taste
are
well
perfect
very
little
to
knock
about
this
beer
and
considering
that
you
can
pick
it
up
for
9
a
sixer
well
perfection
overall
this
is
a
standard
in
my
fridge
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
81
can
pretty
much
grab
this
off
the
shelf
any
day
of
the
week
and
it
will
never
be
a
bad
choice
o
classic
brewery
with
a
classic
version
of
the
style
not
much
else
needs
to
be
said
pours
a
cloudy
lemon
and
straw
color
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
disappears
theres
also
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
banana
clove
and
peppercorn
are
most
prominent
on
the
nose
and
after
that
lemon
and
bready
yeast
in
the
mouth
coriander
and
other
spices
come
out
along
with
a
big
belgian
yeast
characteristic
banana
flavor
and
bubblegum
the
body
is
light
with
a
sweet
finish
just
love
this
one
great
wheat
beer
that
goes
great
with
any
grilled
food
i
just
wish
it
was
more
thick
also
for
a
top
quality
import
beer
the
price
is
not
that
bad
as
compareded
to
how
pricey
belgian
ales
can
get
the
bottle
says
keep
it
around
chilled
to
about
4652
degrees
fahrenheit
but
if
you
have
it
a
few
degrees
warmer
than
52
degrees
you
can
really
takes
the
wheat
mouthfeel
is
creamy
crisp
and
dry
yup
all
of
em
the
gold
standard
of
a
true
hefeweiss
bier
same
score
for
the
other
versions
as
well
krystal
filtered
and
the
dunkel
weiss
wonderful
massive
heads
pour
slowly
wonderful
classic
fragrance
the
real
deal
the
bar
is
high
on
this
why
go
under
overall
a
more
balanced
maltforward
hefeweizen
which
creates
for
me
somehow
both
a
rounder
and
more
complex
flavor
profile
an
enjoyable
example
of
a
traditional
german
wheat
beer
that
encompasses
both
creativity
and
tradition
hefeweissbier
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
large
frothy
massive
lacing
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
cloves
and
banana
notes
a
little
ester
the
taste
has
a
great
creamy
crisp
wheat
backbone
with
cloves
and
banana
notes
with
a
nice
mellow
ester
flavor
very
drinkable
very
full
flavor
perfect
carbonation
overall
wow
overall
a
disappointment
a
very
pretty
beer
smells
great
feels
great
tastes
good
but
less
than
i
expected
still
if
i
wanted
good
hefeweizen
ill
acknowledge
that
ive
had
none
better
i
think
hefeweizen
is
just
not
my
thing
overall
not
much
needs
to
be
said
this
is
a
great
beer
my
favorite
hefe
to
date
and
ive
had
a
few
one
of
the
best
beers
crafted
ever
so
smooth
so
tasty
ripe
bananas
breadyeast
spices
delicious
i
would
rank
this
my
second
favorite
hefe
beer
next
to
the
ayinger
bräu
weisse
i
reviewed
that
beer
already
and
i
think
i
gave
this
weihenstephaner
beer
a
better
review
haha
oh
well
i
just
love
the
really
forward
banana
flavor
of
the
ayinger
and
the
champagne
mouthfeel
its
just
a
matter
of
preference
if
you
handed
me
either
one
of
these
beers
id
give
you
my
first
born
child
the
weihenstephaner
is
a
better
deal
though
i
can
get
it
for
less
than
2
a
bottle
11
2oz
while
the
ayinger
is
about
3
50
16oz
a
bottle
it
has
about
5oz
more
of
yummy
juice
though
overall
a
topshelf
hefeweizen
that
everyone
should
try
sessionable
affordable
and
delicious
it
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
o
highly
refreshing
and
tasty
certainly
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
hefe
i
have
had
o
fantastic
satisfying
drinkable
the
best
i
have
had
o
one
of
the
best
hefeweizens
out
there
smells
and
tastes
amazing
and
is
both
quaffable
and
affordable
prost
pours
a
nice
hazy
light
amber
with
a
large
amount
of
white
foam
aroma
is
strongly
fruity
with
strong
yeast
and
sweet
malt
tastes
like
a
classic
iconic
take
on
the
style
cloves
and
allspice
banana
and
perhaps
another
tropical
flavor
like
subtle
mango
more
hops
than
other
examples
of
the
style
which
cut
the
intense
sweetness
but
not
enough
to
wreck
the
sweetness
or
push
it
too
far
away
a
near
perfect
balance
really
where
ayinger
is
weighted
towards
the
fruit
this
one
leans
towards
the
spice
with
a
strong
clove
flavor
building
as
you
progress
through
a
bottle
finish
lingers
and
leaves
some
yeasty
sweetness
and
a
little
bitterness
overall
complex
and
layered
flavors
that
are
light
years
away
from
an
american
wheat
made
with
standard
yeast
bottle
at
the
jones
bside
in
gainesville
pours
a
deep
murky
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
smells
of
banana
clove
yeast
flavor
is
banana
pears
apples
clove
yeast
with
a
nice
crisp
bitter
hint
and
plenty
of
prickly
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
light
with
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
just
so
right
on
and
perfect
for
the
style
could
drink
it
all
day
pours
a
golden
hazy
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
smell
is
banana
cloves
and
spice
and
yeast
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
bananas
cloves
spices
and
citrus
medium
body
and
prefect
amount
of
carbonation
great
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
one
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
this
beer
got
me
hooked
on
wheat
beers
namely
white
wheats
one
of
my
favorites
awesome
mouth
feel
chewy
lots
of
wheat
and
and
yeast
slight
citrus
with
a
little
banana
very
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
with
big
deep
complex
and
smooth
flavor
i
live
this
beer
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
i
never
really
had
gotten
in
to
beer
until
i
was
28
then
i
tried
this
beer
and
ill
i
want
to
do
is
drink
and
did
new
beers
to
try
however
i
have
not
found
a
beer
as
good
as
this
one
overall
a
very
good
beer
a
nice
choice
for
a
refreshing
beer
if
you
dont
want
something
too
summery
and
can
easily
be
enjoyed
yearround
which
is
actually
probably
its
best
feature
the
only
reason
i
didnt
score
it
higher
for
taste
and
overall
is
that
it
did
not
stand
out
much
compared
to
many
other
good
hefeweizens
i
have
had
o
overall
great
beer
i
love
to
keep
this
one
on
tap
its
great
in
the
summer
but
works
in
the
fall
and
winter
as
well
my
favorite
hefe
pour
was
slightly
cloudy
smelled
of
banana
and
clove
immediately
the
mouthful
was
substantial
it
tasted
tropical
definitely
banana
clove
maybe
nutmeg
this
beer
is
considered
the
standard
for
the
style
it
lives
up
to
its
reputation
but
the
mouthful
and
taste
was
just
a
little
bit
harsher
than
its
cousin
paulaner
overall
its
perfect
the
gold
standard
what
more
can
you
say
drink
one
period
o
there
isnt
so
much
of
the
banana
aspect
in
this
one
i
know
its
well
regarded
and
i
agree
it
is
good
but
i
thought
this
was
more
mild
than
my
favorite
weizens
benchmark
hefeweizen
that
is
hard
to
beat
bold
and
not
boring
given
its
balanced
but
not
timid
bitterness
and
malts
pours
hazy
bright
gold
with
a
nice
healthy
two
finger
white
head
smell
is
amazing
belgian
yeasy
banana
grassy
clove
some
slight
citrus
taste
starts
with
a
smooth
grassy
hay
sweetness
kicks
in
with
banana
spice
some
lemon
mouthfeel
is
perfect
enough
body
to
give
you
wheat
flavor
while
still
being
thin
enough
to
be
refreshing
overall
this
beer
is
a
gold
standard
i
love
grabbing
this
one
so
accessible
that
its
easy
to
forget
how
amazing
it
is
no
beer
lover
should
miss
this
a
severe
prost
to
all
the
homies
one
of
my
favourite
beers
a
classic
that
is
very
hard
to
beat
would
suit
most
palates
from
the
experienced
craft
beer
drinker
to
someone
new
to
craft
beer
o
just
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
this
must
be
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
it
certainly
is
the
beer
that
i
completely
enjoy
i
must
recommend
it
again
and
again
a
full
two
fingers
of
foam
light
tight
bubbled
head
that
drops
to
reveal
some
spotty
lacing
light
gold
to
medium
yellow

color
some
sediment
is
visible
in
the
beer

s
true
to
the
style
the
nose
has
loads
of
banana
and
clove
with
a
light
and
fruity
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
mountain
papaya
and
bubblegum

like

o
id
happily
drink
this
all
day
amazingly
balanced
this
beer
is
outstanding
o
i
might
be
a
bit
biased
since
i
am
a
big
fan
of
wheats
especially
a
sucker
for
german
hefes
but
this
is
literally
my
favorite
beer
it
is
absolutely
perfect
beer
for
its
style
where
every
wheat
in
the
world
should
be
compared
to
and
strives
to
be
weihenstephaner
has
been
open
since
1040
and
it
shows
from
the
quality
and
perfection
of
this
beer
o
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
better
beers
so
im
a
bit
biased
it
still
remains
one
of
the
best
overall
beers
ive
ever
tasted
o
i
have
no
doubts
this
is
the
benchmark
of
the
style
for
good
reason
this
one
is
on
my
list
of
would
purchase
by
the
case
beers
if
you
havent
had
it
go
out
and
have
it
if
you
have
just
keep
enjoying
it
o
i
think
this
one
was
not
in
perfect
conditions
but
its
still
a
awesome
beer
probably
the
best
hefeweiss
i
have
ever
had
the
beer
had
a
great
balance
of
banana
and
clove
in
both
the
taste
and
the
smell
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
could
be
sessioned
easily
it
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
nice
white
head
that
did
not
leave
much
of
a
lace
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
excellent
o
if
youve
never
had
this
do
yourself
a
favor
as
for
the
rest
who
care
not
to
read
this
review
cause
theyve
had
it
a
million
times
im
also
giving
it
the
score
it
deserves
after
much
consideration
i
have
concluded
that
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
love
hefes
and
this
is
the
king
this
has
officially
unseated
delirium
tremens
as
my
favorite
beer
o
if
you
are
looking
for
the
best
wheat
beer
in
the
world
i
would
strongly
recommend
picking
a
six
pack
of
these
up
it
is
the
best
example
of
a
bavarian
hefe
weissbier
out
there
and
you
owe
yourself
the
experience
that
this
beer
will
provide
i
am
rating
this
beer
as
a
wheat
beer
and
therefore
ill
give
it
a
perfect
55
in
all
categories
because
this
is
what
other
wheat
beers
want
to
be
after
almost
1000
years
of
brewing
it
makes
sense
that
the
flavor
and
quality
of
this
beer
is
where
it
is
in
all
this
is
the
perfect
grilling
beer
or
setting
out
on
the
patio
the
best
representation
of
a
hefeweizen
from
one
of
the
worlds
oldest
breweries
o
this
is
very
close
to
perfection
easily
the
best
hefeweizen
ive
ever
had
and
whats
more
the
best
beer
or
any
type
ive
ever
had
to
date
even
over
my
own
homebrew
simply
astounding
and
what
the
beer
experience
should
be
this
beer
has
a
really
good
amount
of
flavor
and
really
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
still
not
mindblowing
but
just
really
well
done
a
bit
lighter
on
the
mouthfeel
than
i
possibly
prefer
overall
spectacular
beer
one
of
the
top
three
ive
ever
had
also
has
sentimental
value
as
this
was
the
beer
that
turned
me
on
to
trying
all
sorts
beers
instead
of
the
standard
nonbeer
advocates
drink
list
not
much
else
to
be
said
that
hasnt
already
been
said
about
this
beer
other
than
this
brew
represents
beer
royalty
at
its
finest
o
a
great
introduction
to
those
who
havent
really
had
the
style
pretty
much
a
baseline
for
hefes
i
do
however
prefer
franzy
not
a
beer
that
i
would
personally
choose
on
a
regular
basis
as
im
not
a
fan
of
the
yeast
or
grain
bill
but
it
is
definitely
well
brewed
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
fully
deserves
its
iconic
status
happy
4th
of
july
everyone
o
extremely
pleasent
o
fantastic
beer
will
be
enjoying
this
one
over
and
over
all
summer
long
o
very
enjoyable
light
and
refreshing
not
a
big
flavor
beer
but
it
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
after
every
sip
the
standard
for
hefeweizens
overall
delicious
im
new
to
the
whole
hefeweissbier
thing
the
shock
topblue
moon
phenomenon
has
been
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
shame
on
me
for
waiting
so
long
im
still
not
going
to
put
a
lemon
wedge
in
my
beer
though
overall
i
tried
this
during
a
blind
tasting
and
i
preferred
the
krystal
version
over
this
i
wold
definitely
try
this
again
i
am
not
really
a
huge
wheat
beer
fan
but
i
approve
of
this
one
o
i
thought
i
might
rate
this
a
bit
higher
the
flavor
is
great
but
the
hefe
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
finish
still
a
very
good
beer
if
not
the
best
hefe
out
there
great
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
recommended
cheers
tasted
from
a
bottle
and
tap
both
are
just
as
good
personally
prefer
the
bottle
cos
you
can
control
the
pour
head
and
more
importantly
the
goodness
thats
left
at
the
bottom
overall
certainly
deserving
of
its
world
class
status
for
the
hefes
and
i
consider
this
a
go
to
in
the
summer
months
when
i
want
to
mix
it
up
from
the
hoppy
ipas
o
i
have
to
admit
i
was
as
skeptical
as
you
could
be
on
this
one
theres
a
local
bar
that
serves
german
ales
and
this
one
is
always
the
one
being
praised
to
no
end
my
skepticism
has
been
put
aside
this
brew
is
every
bit
phenomenal
as
you
hear
a
must
try
i
must
say
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
way
too
much
clove
good
color
and
head
aftertaste
was
all
clove
as
well
some
hints
of
citrus
very
low
hops
flavor
was
better
ice
cold
as
opposed
to
the
46
52
the
bottle
advised
11
2
oz
bottle
the
sixpack
cost
almost
ten
dollars
i
would
classify
it
as
a
good
beer
but
certainly
not
the
98
it
is
getting
here
it
tastes
like
a
seasonal
flavored
offering
to
me
maybe
around
the
holidays
with
all
of
the
other
clove
type
spices
and
flavors
o
nothing
fancy
but
hits
all
the
high
notes
for
a
wonderful
overall
experience
di
could
drink
this
all
day
it
tastes
delicious
and
its
so
light
and
refreshing
pours
a
murky
honey
yellow
with
plenty
of
haze
and
a
cloud
like
head
of
foam
in
the
glass
its
got
style
and
beauty
the
nose
is
bracing
and
not
run
away
with
fruity
sweetness
banana
wheat
earthy
yeast
fruits
clove
and
as
it
warms
a
little
some
pepper
the
palate
is
immaculate
with
tall
wheat
sweet
biscuit
and
citric
hops
its
clean
and
civilized
leaves
with
a
small
taste
of
alcohol
and
drier
and
drier
as
it
drinks
a
resounding
hefe
that
dares
to
growl
a
little
in
the
glass
my
favorite
hefeweizen
edit
revisited
as
part
of
a
blind
test
against
ayinger
pour
was
murky
yellow
hazy
very
sweet
gum
and
banana
smell
the
head
was
taller
and
fluffier
than
ayinger
sweet
good
carbonation
smooth
clean
and
crisp
overall
still
a
delicious
and
prime
example
of
a
german
hefe
o
this
is
way
more
than
i
expected
when
i
ordered
it
the
only
reason
i
didnt
put
up
5s
is
my
lack
of
experience
this
beer
is
going
to
be
like
heady
topper
was
for
ipas
its
going
to
set
me
out
on
the
hunt
for
beers
like
this
one
i
wonder
if
ill
find
one
best
heff
beer
ive
ever
had
says
worlds
oldest
brewery
on
the
bottle
and
guess
what
all
that
time
brewing
has
done
them
some
good
perfectly
balanced
nice
nose
and
mouthfeel
very
smooth
i
like
banana
and
this
is
prevalent
in
this
beer
although
banana
is
typically
in
heff
beers
i
bought
my
bottle
for
a
little
under
3
and
its
the
best
3
ive
ever
spent
ive
seen
other
on
tap
but
have
not
tried
and
want
to
do
not
pass
this
beer
up
its
the
perfect
sunny
day
brew
o
this
could
easily
be
a
daily
weissbier
if
it
were
more
accessible
i
really
dont
have
any
complaints
or
suggested
improvements
its
just
a
wellrounded
balanced
sweet
beer
while
weihenstephans
hefe
is
very
highly
regarded
i
wasnt
really
blown
away
by
it
but
then
i
admit
to
the
style
not
being
one
of
favorites
still
its
as
good
as
or
better
than
any
other
hefe
ive
yet
had
and
its
something
ill
be
revisiting
during
the
warm
weather
months
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
poured
with
a
thick
foamy
head
with
a
good
amount
of
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
citrusy
malty
smell
a
very
hop
forward
taste
with
a
smooth
malty
finish
doesnt
leave
a
bitter
taste
afterward
it
is
definitely
the
cream
of
the
crop
when
it
comes
to
hefeweizens
i
am
more
of
a
hop
head
and
drink
mainly
ipas
and
high
ibu
pale
ales
but
i
do
enjoy
a
hefe
every
once
in
a
while
it
was
my
first
love
when
it
came
to
craft
beers
after
all
one
of
the
better
hefe
weizen
i
have
had
needs
to
be
cold
with
nice
foam
easily
availble
both
in
bottles
and
on
tap
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
standard
weizen
available
standard
yes
but
still
not
so
standard
as
the
big
ones
franziskaner
paulaner
erdinger
etc
prost
lampertland
o
a
good
heffe
well
balanced
flavor
a
little
bitter
upfront
and
super
smooth
going
down
other
this
style
is
pronounced
hayfuhvaitsehn
in
german
not
hehfuh
as
many
americans
say
a
must
buy
for
any
hefeweizen
lover
and
something
i
will
be
purchasing
a
lot
of
especially
at
the
price
o
for
how
good
it
tastes
imported
i
cant
imagine
having
a
fresh
pour
from
the
brewery
an
excellent
example
and
perhaps
the
example
of
a
german
hefeweizen
not
one
piece
but
a
sum
of
its
parts
o
light
feel
and
a
delicious
crisp
refreshing
taste
perfect
beer
for
summer
and
at
this
price
point
i
think
i
found
my
fall
back
for
the
summer
m
carbonated
light
but
with
some
body
golden
brown
beer
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
leaves
thick
bunches
of
lacing
aromas
of
fruits
and
sweet
spices
exceptionally
delicious
complex
flavor
consisting
primarily
of
apricot
apple
cider
and
spice
s
very
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
my
new
goto
favorite
for
spring
and
summer
wonderful
balance
and
refreshment
after
my
beloved
quads
from
the
late
fallwinter
glorious
pale
golden
color
with
just
a
hint
of
the
wheat
haze
clean
and
crisp
from
start
to
finish
with
a
bit
of
banana
and
freshlybaked
bread
pours
a
hazy
honey
color
with
a
thick
cap
of
fluffy
white
foam
aroma
smells
cleanly
of
banana
and
clove
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
what
smells
like
coriander
flavor
matches
the
nose
with
banana
and
clove
complementing
a
refined
wheat
flavor
the
wheat
becomes
most
pronounced
in
the
finish
while
the
front
end
remains
more
juicy
yeast
character
lends
some
nice
complexity
and
texture
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
spectacular
with
lively
velvety
carbonation
that
caresses
the
palate
and
enhances
the
quintessential
flavors
of
the
beer
this
is
the
hefeweizen
to
which
all
other
hefeweizens
are
compared
its
supremely
balanced
perfectly
executed
and
possessed
of
perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
mouthfeel
of
any
beer
regardless
of
styleundoubtedly
world
class
bottom
line
style
masterpiece
very
refeshing
and
different
if
you
have
never
had
a
hefeweizen
before
this
was
first
hefeweizen
i
had
tried
and
it
got
me
hooked
very
similar
taste
to
ayinger
brau
weisse
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
pour
it
into
a
hefeweizen
glass
if
you
have
one
its
the
only
way
to
appreciate
this
brew
o
the
reputation
is
worthy
mouthfeel
very
heavy
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
crisp
and
satisfying
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
o
its
the
best
in
its
classstyle
in
my
opinion
terrific
balance
in
both
aroma
and
taste
this
was
the
style
that
started
it
all
for
me
and
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
when
first
starting
out
still
is
a
solid
goto
option
for
a
nice
hot
summer
day
overall
best
hefeweizen
out
there
period
for
the
style
it
is
absolutely
perfect
in
order
i
would
say
it
goes
weihenstephaner
franziskaner
then
paulaner
as
the
best
authentic
german
hefes
so
well
balanced
and
drinkable
if
you
hand
this
to
a
non
beer
drinker
they
will
love
it
very
accesible
the
price
is
just
right
on
this
as
well
prost
this
is
it
king
of
the
hefeweizens
its
a
beautiful
creamy
cloudy
light
orange
colored
delight
the
head
quickly
goes
away
but
the
thin
lace
that
is
left
is
bigger
than
most
and
a
chunkiness
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
taste
follows
the
smell
almost
exactly
the
same
it
is
so
balanced
banana
and
bubblegum
dont
overwhelm
the
spicy
and
pepper
notes
lace
the
predominant
lemon
and
wheat
goodness
i
will
get
this
again
o
the
touchstone
of
bavarian
hefeweizens
and
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
wonderfully
flavorful
beer
a
perfect
beverage
for
the
warm
seasons
that
are
here
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
had
a
nice
fruit
note
excellent
with
lite
food
fare
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
medium
mouth
feel
and
smooth
finish
very
good
for
slow
sippinga
good
warmhot
summer
drink
extremely
refreshing
a
low
alcohol
and
bite
factorlends
it
to
drinking
for
a
few
hours
o
the
benchmark
hefe
can
find
a
lot
of
more
expensive
ones
but
not
many
better
ones
o
i
honestly
dont
see
anywhere
this
beer
could
improve
and
for
that
i
need
to
give
it
a
5
overall
overall
impression
a
wonderful
bouquet
of
yeast
character
coupled
with
a
well
balanced
backdrop
of
malt
and
hops
refreshing
perhaps
a
little
too
much
carbonation
creating
that
overly
sharpprickly
feeling
could
reduce
priming
sugar
or
co2
slightly
o
a
good
beer
especially
for
the
stye
but
i
dont
see
why
this
is
such
a
beloved
beer
overall
quintessential
hefe
really
tasty
and
within
style
perfectly
might
be
the
best
ive
had
definitely
authentic
german
a
must
try
4
75
overall
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beeer
it
is
clear
his
brewery
to
be
their
official
representation
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
greats
overall
this
is
superb
and
super
affordable
my
favorite
hefeweizen
for
sure
overall
the
fact
that
everyone
calls
this
such
a
classic
brew
is
a
testament
to
how
wonderful
this
brew
is
a
classic
that
is
great
for
those
with
a
wonderfully
developed
palette
or
those
who
are
just
breaking
into
the
craft
scene
extremely
inexpensive
for
where
this
beer
comes
from
o
a
simply
wonderful
and
stunning
brew
lives
up
to
the
hype
certainly
a
go
to
beer
for
this
style
surprisingly
inexpensive
too
may
buy
again
soon
good
yeast
esters
and
a
surprisingly
bready
backbone
fairly
complex
but
wish
the
flavor
lingered
more
pours
like
a
liquid
orange
appears
as
such
for
sure
intricate
lacing
on
the
head
now
to
the
real
draw
i
may
just
as
well
have
a
mouth
full
of
caramel
richness
and
depth
rules
the
day
i
profess
being
impressed
at
a
beer
i
hesitate
to
swallow
o
but
i
do
citrus
the
richest
creamiest
citrus
in
all
the
land
king
among
wheats
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
wheat
beer
readily
available
at
reasonably
priced
10
99
in
my
area
for
a
6
pack
but
at
times
can
be
difficult
to
find
fresh
a
classic
and
absolutely
worth
a
try
prost
go
hawks
o
refreshing
definitely
not
your
run
of
the
mill
hefe
a
wheat
beer
at
the
top
of
my
list
overall
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
favorite
wheat
beer
what
a
wonderful
change
from
my
full
speed
ahead
ipas
dipas
wife
saw
case
and
said
spring
for
it
and
it
is
quite
delightful
rarely
do
i
spurge
on
such
good
beer
but
i
have
been
dying
for
something
alittle
mellow
so
went
for
it
nice
rich
color
with
a
thick
foam
head
and
the
smell
of
cloves
and
bananas
very
nice
great
great
desert
beer
but
still
holding
that
beer
geek
flag
high
the
perfect
wheat
beer
ill
be
damned
if
i
find
a
better
one
o
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
heck
its
the
1
rated
hefeweizen
on
the
site
after
withstanding
thousands
of
reviews
i
can
understand
why
for
this
style
many
consider
this
to
be
the
best
of
the
best
clearly
theres
an
artistry
to
the
elegance
of
this
beers
execution
its
just
very
unfortunate
that
i
dont
find
that
terribly
exciting
this
beer
pairs
will
with
sounds
of
gunter
sommer
on
his
with
the
group
poirez
on
either
cds
entitled
or
q
overall
while
this
is
only
my
second
hefeweiess
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
always
available
and
cheap
truly
art
overall
this
is
my
current
favorite
beer
ive
yet
to
match
it
if
you
need
a
nice
refreshing
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
this
one
it
is
an
excellent
introduction
to
finer
beers
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
glass
appearance
is
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
lasts
well
into
the
beer
and
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
wonderful
with
notes
of
banana
bread
and
other
fruity
esters
taste
is
great
with
all
the
wonderful
aromas
present
while
the
carbonation
is
visible
in
the
glass
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
beer
and
its
thinner
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
weiss
beer
overallprobably
the
best
german
beer
i
have
ever
had
weihenstephaner
claims
to
be
the
oldest
brewery
and
i
dont
doubt
it
with
this
brew
this
beer
tastes
like
its
been
perfected
over
the
last
couple
hundred
of
years
the
price
isnt
to
bad
and
it
should
be
available
in
most
markets
this
is
going
to
be
my
go
to
german
brew
4
5
o
this
is
a
world
class
beer
yup
its
a
hefe
and
its
damn
delicious
will
drink
again
soon
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
example
is
quite
tasty
one
of
the
best
hefeweizens
ive
had
i
first
tried
this
on
tap
when
i
was
visiting
berlin
and
i
seek
it
out
whenever
i
can
the
weihenstephaner
is
my
favorite
wheat
beer
with
notes
of
banana
and
bubblegum
and
a
smooth
clean
finish
no
need
to
add
a
slice
of
citrus
to
this
beer
as
its
full
of
flavor
and
requires
nothing
more
o
this
is
the
yardstick
that
wheat
beer
must
measure
against
ive
had
many
but
none
are
as
good
quite
common
and
quite
delicious
treat
yourself
to
a
hefeweizen
mercedes
to
see
why
this
bavarian
brewery
has
been
around
so
long
it
really
is
that
damn
perfect
i
include
this
with
each
bottlecan
review
because
i
feel
that
for
the
average
consumer
to
even
approach
an
unknown
beer
its
the
packaging
that
entices
rather
than
the
actual
end
product
points
and
half
points
are
given
for
style
readability
tasting
note
brewers
notes
and
ease
of
bottle
reuse
backlog
this
was
the
first
truly
craft
beer
that
i
had
ever
tried
and
i
remember
it
fondly
even
though
i
might
not
have
been
able
to
fully
appreciate
its
aesthetics
and
complexity
at
the
time
i
was
also
an
idiot
and
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
but
that
didnt
stop
it
from
being
delicious
bought
a
single
from
wegmans
for
about
3
my
first
impressions
likened
this
beer
to
fresh
banana
bread
with
some
clove
and
it
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
had
a
good
combination
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
that
was
both
subtle
and
pleasant
in
character
a
definite
treat
and
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
tried
to
this
date
an
outstanding
brew
and
probably
the
cheapest
highly
rated
beer
here
on
ba
at
under
4
bucks
a
bottle
pours
murky
orange
color
brassy
and
hard
to
see
through
thicker
than
a
normal
hefe
with
a
huge
three
inches
of
lasting
bone
white
head
smells
great
too
some
traditional
banana
notes
but
hardly
any
of
that
clove
spice
yeast
aroma
more
floral
than
that
like
a
dewey
spring
meadow
clovery
heavy
on
the
malted
wheat
flavor
also
has
the
springtime
essence
slightly
floral
again
which
goes
great
with
the
fruity
yeast
and
banana
bread
malt
vibe
finish
is
a
little
sweet
a
little
bitter
a
loaded
with
citrus
juice
fuller
body
for
the
style
is
the
appeal
here
its
really
soft
but
its
big
for
a
wheat
beer
carbonation
is
lively
making
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
honestly
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
i
can
remember
drinking
the
yeast
is
subtle
but
distinct
and
thats
what
makes
it
this
is
going
to
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
for
the
combination
of
quality
and
value
many
thanks
for
this
one
o
great
beer
i
overlooked
this
one
for
a
while
but
it
really
is
exceptional
if
you
could
only
have
one
hefe
in
your
life
make
it
this
one
i
had
this
with
a
lovely
fish
dish
at
a
restaurant
on
ocracoke
island
and
it
has
changed
me
i
always
have
this
available
in
my
fridge
few
other
hefes
rival
this
one
most
just
look
upon
weihenstephaners
work
and
despair
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
profile
the
yeast
imparts
fantastic
banana
notes
and
some
underlying
bubblegum
notes
the
spice
character
is
also
nicely
done
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
an
easy
to
drink
flavorful
refreshing
offering
ill
definitely
have
it
again
o
very
drinkable
great
representation
of
the
style
quite
impressive
that
this
beer
is
always
top
notch
better
on
tap
but
the
availability
of
the
bottles
is
great
overall
after
trying
a
wide
variety
of
hefeweizens
i
find
this
one
to
be
the
top
dog
this
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
brews
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
tasting
and
i
consider
it
to
be
at
the
top
of
its
class
overall
one
of
the
top
here
beers
on
the
world
enjoyed
in
the
past
now
and
more
in
the
future
super
delicious
goodness
just
a
fantastic
hefeweizen
and
another
damn
good
beer
by
weihenstephaner
im
not
too
into
hefes
but
id
be
willing
to
reconsider
after
having
this
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
at
wine
country
in
shreveport
i
ticked
the
appearance
a
bit
low
knowing
it
would
probably
look
better
in
a
proper
glass
pours
a
healthy
orange
with
good
foamy
head
amazing
banana
and
clove
yeasty
aromas
that
follow
through
into
the
flavor
a
nice
punch
of
citrus
in
the
finish
its
super
smooth
this
is
another
perfect
example
of
how
a
hefe
should
be
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
transforms
into
meringue
on
top
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
bubbly
rise
from
the
bottom
causing
a
seemingly
endless
head
smells
of
banana
bubble
gum
and
a
hint
of
pepper
nutmeg
and
allspice
a
lightly
sugary
sweet
malt
provides
a
backdrop
for
the
showcase
of
yeasty
aromas
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
malt
with
a
bready
yeasty
taste
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
spicy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
guess
if
youve
been
doing
this
that
long
you
are
bound
to
get
it
right
overall
my
first
perfect
5
beer
and
one
that
will
always
remain
a
favorite
of
mine
nothing
quite
beats
it
as
an
easy
drinking
all
around
tasty
beer
if
you
even
remotely
enjoy
hefeweizens
you
should
try
this
out
if
youre
not
a
fan
but
havent
tried
weihenstephaner
then
give
it
a
try
now
i
must
admit
that
i
do
not
like
wheat
beers
the
wheat
twang
kills
it
for
me
if
i
were
to
rate
this
to
my
opinion
it
would
be
53333
where
my
5
would
be
given
to
the
presentation
of
the
beer
take
that
as
you
will
i
suppose
o
this
is
really
one
of
the
best
globally
available
hefes
youre
ever
going
to
find
the
balance
crispiness
smooth
flavor
profile
and
general
drinkability
are
all
admirable
for
me
a
top
10
beer
the
taste
follows
suit
with
some
very
mild
clover
mixed
with
banana
and
fruityness
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
i
am
not
usually
big
on
the
clover
flavor
profile
but
this
is
so
mild
that
i
can
still
enjoy
this
beer
o
pretty
solid
but
honestly
i
was
expecting
better
based
on
reputation
id
like
to
try
this
on
draft
sometime
to
see
if
its
markedly
better
a
solid
hefeweizen
that
i
will
definitely
drink
again
but
not
the
best
ive
had
the
showcase
is
somewhat
nearly
immaculate
with
a
hazy
yellow
amber
color
and
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
when
the
head
retention
and
lacing
left
are
exceptional
the
aroma
and
flavor
drive
forth
so
mellow
inviting
fresh
yet
balance
with
a
big
touch
of
fruity
ester
citriclemony
zest
and
bubblegum
that
nicely
parade
with
a
sweet
biscuity
malt
and
clove
with
a
spice
while
wheat
with
a
twang
the
feel
is
smooth
with
a
velvety
body
and
refreshingly
crispnessdryness
no
doubt
this
beer
is
cult
my
veneration
to
the
old
weihenstephan
again
claims
to
be
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
whether
it
is
true
or
not
is
irrelevant
the
beer
tastes
richly
of
bubblegum
banana
with
clove
spice
notes
the
beer
begins
with
bubblegum
and
spice
just
as
it
is
building
in
flavor
a
slight
yeasty
funk
can
be
felt
in
the
taste
but
is
quickly
washed
away
by
the
big
banana
bread
flavors
that
have
been
building
in
the
mouth
this
eventually
wanes
down
into
a
banana
aftertaste
with
light
clove
and
bubblegum
hints
at
the
sides
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
superbly
creamy
with
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
slightly
heavy
and
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
thick
sticky
feeling
on
the
tongue
while
the
mouth
as
a
whole
feels
clean
but
slightly
coated
in
candied
banana
overall
this
is
a
superb
hefeweizen
as
would
be
expected
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
i
hold
this
up
there
with
zero
gravities
weizenheimer
as
the
best
in
the
style
a
superb
beer
that
epitomizes
and
optimizes
the
style
beautifully
this
beer
is
a
must
try
o
almost
in
my
top
10
i
think
it
easily
is
a
4
5
beer
overall
great
beer
this
is
the
best
hefeweizen
that
i
have
had
i
cant
wait
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
really
great
beer
not
as
great
after
it
starts
to
go
flat
though
o
very
solid
hefe
the
taste
was
spot
on
but
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
complexity
of
the
nose
would
enjoy
again
style
wise
it
is
the
epitome
of
style
no
doubt
about
it
a
well
deserved
4
75
personally
a
good
3
75
for
a
wheat
beer
pale
goldenyellow
pour
hazy
with
a
tall
fluffy
white
head
decent
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
yeasty
aroma
bready
banana
esters
clovey
spice
pretty
much
exemplary
of
the
style
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
pale
bready
malts
doughy
toasted
wheat
classic
hefe
yeast
banana
and
clove
medium
body
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
soft
carbonation
this
is
where
you
go
for
a
nononsense
hefeweizen
overall
these
guys
have
been
brewing
this
one
for
a
while
so
i
imagine
that
they
have
perfected
this
style
i
would
tend
to
agree
for
some
strange
reason
this
one
is
not
available
in
utah
and
that
is
a
shame
the
claims
they
make
about
this
beer
arent
false
or
even
exaggerated
this
is
some
truly
great
stuff
here
one
of
if
not
the
best
hefe
ive
had
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
great
flavor
low
abv
goes
down
smooth
whats
not
to
love
poured
a
nice
vibrant
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
that
diminishes
slowly
over
the
course
of
the
500ml
beer
the
taste
is
about
what
i
remember
from
enjoying
this
beer
frequently
while
living
in
germany
still
a
nice
fruit
finish
and
that
wonderful
hefe
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
buy
especially
for
someone
looking
for
a
more
authentic
german
experience
thanks
in
large
to
the
500ml
service
size
of
all
of
the
wonderful
beers
i
had
in
germany
this
one
seems
closest
to
the
real
deal
as
any
ive
had
overall
this
is
an
excellent
hefeweizen
tasty
and
complex
while
maintaining
a
crisp
smooth
character
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
i
didnt
expect
anything
different
i
will
not
compare
this
to
the
standard
because
this
is
the
standard
o
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
by
far
the
best
hefeweizen
that
ive
had
and
will
enjoy
this
one
many
times
to
come
i
can
only
imagine
having
one
of
these
fresh
overseas
weihenstephan
hefe
weissbier
the
bottle
says
na
so
easy
to
drink
anytime
of
the
year
the
head
is
so
impressive
it
almost
looks
like
dessert
almost
makes
you
want
to
buy
more
weizen
glasses
consistently
good
a
great
beer
to
always
rely
on
yet
another
great
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
o
over
i
never
thought
id
find
a
top
100
beer
for
2
19
a
bottle
but
im
glad
i
did
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
much
better
than
la
fin
du
monde
o
i
love
this
beer
it
will
be
a
beer
that
i
drink
for
years
to
come
great
wonderful
tasty
delicious
bananay
sweet
bitter
mild
drinkable
spicy
yummy
o
i
really
enjoy
sn
kellerweis
but
this
might
surpass
it
this
is
surely
one
ill
go
back
to
again
especially
at
3
bucks
a
piece
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
at
biergarten
in
hoboken
nj
a
great
wheat
beer
very
drinkable
and
great
for
the
summer
this
is
my
favorite
style
and
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
on
tap
or
in
bottle
sheer
perfection
cheers
what
a
fantastic
beer
to
enjoy
while
i
sit
here
and
watch
football
i
could
see
having
this
in
about
any
scenario
or
season
the
price
was
great
too
for
the
quality
of
this
well
known
world
lass
beer
i
paid
2
99
for
a
pint
ill
do
that
again
for
sure
overall
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
beer
again
any
time
soon
pours
a
hazy
goldenhued
liquid
into
a
weissbier
glass
head
is
perfect
as
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
lacing
is
light
smell
is
light
citrus
bright
cloves
and
subtle
malt
mouthfeel
is
light
on
carbonation
and
alcohol
taste
is
a
brilliant
explosion
of
malt
bready
yeast
clovebanana
and
delicate
sweetness
finish
is
smoother
than
water
off
a
ducks
back
no
bitterness
at
all
while
most
weissbiers
lean
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
sweetness
scale
weihenstepher
nails
the
balance
perfectly
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
o
this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
hefeweizen
its
easy
to
see
why
its
rated
the
best
everything
is
so
nearly
perfect
for
the
style
that
its
tough
to
not
give
this
one
5s
across
the
board
the
fact
that
its
so
readily
available
in
the
us
makes
it
even
better
without
a
doubt
this
is
a
must
try
for
all
beerlovers
on
tap
pours
cloudy
with
white
head
aroma
is
clove
and
banana
high
carbonation
adds
to
the
tingly
mouthfeel
flavor
is
a
perfect
balance
of
clove
and
banana
and
is
the
best
beer
to
represent
this
style
upfront
you
get
the
tingly
carbonation
then
the
banana
clove
hits
the
middle
and
finishes
semi
dry
outstanding
othis
is
a
fine
example
of
how
to
brew
a
wheat
beer
that
is
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
without
tasting
like
a
watereddown
mess
it
has
more
backbone
than
most
wheats
without
tasting
gimmicky
so
simple
man
i
think
works
well
this
this
wheat
500
ml
bottle
pours
a
murky
dark
yellow
with
a
decent
twofinger
white
head
fairly
high
carbonation
nose
of
yeast
bananas
orange
peel
lemon
zest
standard
wheat

simply
put
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
beers
all
the
characteristics
of
weissbier
are
superbly
blended
together
the
yeast
esters
produce
a
fantastically
balanced
flavour
and
aroma
an
easydrinking
classic
very
refreshing
and
i
could
happily
imagine
sinking
a
few
add
this
to
your
list
of
musttry
beers
overall
this
is
and
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
yummy
goodness
easily
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
tried
some
beers
i
know
from
the
first
sip
are
something
special
and
this
is
one
of
them
lives
up
to
its
rating
an
excellent
beer
o
worth
it
for
me
i
got
tired
of
wheat
beers
and
heffs
quickly
but
this
proved
to
be
a
worthy
contender
in
a
vast
sea
of
complex
beers
out
there
for
a
moderate
price
jump
on
it
delicious
this
is
a
staple
in
the
style
for
a
reason
loads
of
flavor
never
overbearing
and
delightfully
refreshing
truly
the
best
hefeweizen
o
i
cannot
imagine
a
better
hefeweizen
the
challenge
is
to
not
give
this
beer
5s
across
the
boards
but
i
honestly
dont
think
this
recipe
can
be
improved
upon
or
bettered
this
is
a
seemingly
perfect
beer
of
the
style
but
have
allowed
for
personal
tastes
and
such
certainly
a
hefe
you
must
have
when
exploring
the
style
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
simplicity
of
it
blows
me
away
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
should
illustrate
that
yeast
doesnt
just
add
fizz
and
alcohol
to
a
beer
but
actually
makes
the
style
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
you
dont
have
to
be
a
beer
wiz
to
tell
it
proves
that
you
dont
need
an
overwhelming
amount
of
ingredientsflavors
to
make
an
excellent
brew
after
a
week
or
so
of
devouring
stouts
and
porters
i
tried
this
one
at
the
behest
of
my
girlfriend
as
is
almost
always
the
case
she
was
right
this
is
a
good
beer
it
pours
and
looks
like
a
typical
american
lager
in
some
ways
but
that
is
where
that
comparison
ends
for
me
right
away
i
was
struck
but
a
banana
smell
and
taste
i
didnt
expect
that
for
i
had
never
had
a
banana
tasting
beer
before
i
quite
liked
it
overall
this
is
an
easytodrink
refreshing
lighter
beer
that
is
very
satisfying
in
its
splendid
and
unique
taste
me
gusta
o
certainly
the
best
hefe
i
have
tried
this
is
a
style
that
is
hit
or
miss
for
me
as
i
lean
more
towards
the
banana
flavors
than
the
clove
flavors
this
one
is
very
banana
heavy
with
just
a
touch
of
that
spicy
clove
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
overall
a
very
good
wheat
beer
that
is
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
it
definitely
does
this
category
justice
would
buy
again
overall
im
kicking
myself
for
waiting
so
to
try
this
beer
i
enjoy
hefeweizens
immensely
in
the
summer
and
this
is
the
hallmark
of
the
style
for
certain
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
unfiltered
haze
poured
with
a
tall
rocky
white
foam
with
good
staying
power
sweet
ripe
banana
and
spicy
clove
aromas
with
bready
and
yeasty
hints
in
the
background
rich
smooth
feel
with
refreshing
crisp
carbonation
sweet
banana
flavors
down
the
middle
with
clove
around
the
edges
a
touch
of
tangy
bitterness
toward
the
end
as
this
finishes
crisply
and
cleanly
an
extraordinary
summertime
ale
i
get
it
this
is
a
really
great
beer
its
definitely
the
best
german
hefeweizen
ive
ever
had
i
just
dont
think
the
style
is
for
me
that
banana
clove
combo
just
doesnt
make
it
a
beer
i
can
fully
enjoy
again
ill
reiterate
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
this
style
i
can
appreciate
one
when
its
good
even
if
i
dont
reach
for
it

notes
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
dark
golden
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
white
foam
and
lacing
wonderful
aroma
of
clove
banana
and
wheat
dry
wheat
start
and
middle
with
banana
and
a
pleasant
spicy
aftertaste
of
cloves
a
nice
well
integrated
tasty
wheat
beer
very
nice
this
beer
blew
my
mind
the
first
time
i
had
tried
it
really
the
first
time
i
had
a
light
colored
relatively
low
abv
beer
that
tasted
fantastic
one
of
the
worlds
great
beers
the
color
is
a
beautiful
amber
the
taste
is
light
with
definite
citrus
the
only
place
where
this
beer
lost
any
points
in
my
book
was
in
carbonation
ontap
it
didnt
seem
overly
carbonated
but
when
i
had
a
bottle
of
it
my
first
pour
had
a
lot
of
head
and
seemed
about
right
the
second
pour
i
may
have
been
to
gentle
and
the
carbonation
definitely
got
in
the
way
of
what
i
would
consider
the
perfect
mouthfeel
o
excellently
crafted
an
archetype
of
the
style
taste
was
great
the
smell
made
me
think
the
taste
would
tend
toward
the
bitter
but
here
the
fruit
came
more
to
the
front
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
some
american
versions
but
very
palatable
with
more
hops
i
picked
this
up
with
no
expectations
or
foreknowledge
of
the
brand
i
just
knew
it
was
a
hefeweizen
i
hadnt
tried
yet
my
new
benchmark
very
nice
hefeweizen
never
tasted
such
strong
banana
notes
before
in
a
beer
great
drinkability
and
magnificent
in
the
summer
this
bottle
held
up
very
well
despite
being
two
and
a
half
months
away
from
the
best
before
date
i
am
curious
to
see
how
much
better
it
is
fresh
o
in
my
opinon
the
best
of
the
style
others
try
to
do
what
this
does
but
are
simply
caught
short
a
truly
wonderful
brew
that
any
enthusiast
should
seek
overall
one
of
my
favorite
hefes
really
a
benchmark
for
the
style
and
a
beer
everyone
should
try
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
yeasty
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
ring
of
white
foam
leaving
lacing
on
the
glass
an
excellent
appearance
very
true
to
style
near
flawless
scents
of
clove
banana
slight
citrus
some
wheat
malt
and
a
low
level
of
vanilla
a
very
good
aroma
profile
that
hits
the
style
deadon
nothing
is
off
everything
is
present
and
its
all
fantastic
very
nice
flavor
begins
with
spicy
cloves
phenols
and
a
bit
of
banana
esters
moving
into
more
clove
phenols
but
now
balanced
equally
with
banana
esters
and
a
slight
citruslike
sourness
an
undertone
of
crackerlike
malt
is
present
throughout
the
entire
sip
finishes
with
an
equal
balance
of
banana
esters
and
clove
phenols
with
a
slight
lemony
sourness
aftertaste
is
spicy
clove
phenols
and
faint
banana
esters
an
excellent
flavor
profile
the
main
flavors
of
the
style
reveal
themselves
in
full
form
and
several
of
the
optional
flavors
also
come
into
play
very
well
done
balanced
and
refreshing
perfect
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
effervescent
with
high
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
feel
a
very
nice
refreshing
mouthfeel
that
is
perfectly
true
to
style
overall
this
is
an
amazing
hefeweizen
everything
about
it
is
a
perfect
representation
of
the
style
and
this
is
my
number
one
recommendation
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
good
bavarian
hefeweizen
they
say
there
is
a
drought
out
there
but
i
cant
believe
it
as
long
as
i
have
one
of
these
in
my
hand
a
great
beer
maybe
i
will
seek
it
again
after
i
finish
my
three
other
bottles
the
pour
is
great
its
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
with
lovely
thick
head
smell
bananas
and
clove
as
it
should
be
the
taste
was
light
banana
little
clove
when
taken
with
some
of
the
head
without
taking
in
the
head
with
a
drink
the
banana
was
distinct
and
complimented
well
by
clove
and
a
wheatlike
taste
that
fills
the
mouth
it
isnt
super
yeasty
carbonation
and
head
adds
to
a
splendid
mouthfeel
paired
this
beer
with
brick
cheese
and
it
worked
really
well
so
easy
to
drink
and
everything
is
in
perfect
balance
i
couldnt
ask
for
more
on
a
nice
hot
day
o
hefeweizens
usually
arent
my
favorite
beers
however
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
definitely
the
best
ive
had
so
far
and
at
3bottle
you
absolutely
can
not
beat
the
price
very
nice
fruitybready
flavor
that
is
wellbalanced
full
of
flavor
and
very
pleasant
combined
with
an
insane
drinkability
you
have
a
very
fine
beer
highly
recommended
i
will
probably
be
picking
up
more
of
these
overall
hands
down
the
best
hefeweizen
in
the
world
there
is
no
question
about
it
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
and
my
goto
for
the
summer
months
the
balance
and
drinkability
aside
from
the
taste
is
what
sets
this
beer
apart
from
the
other
hefeweizens
you
can
drink
your
pale
ales
and
ipas
in
the
summer
ill
take
a
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
see
why
its
well
liked
this
will
definitely
be
a
part
of
the
rotation
during
these
summer
months
and
may
find
myself
drinking
this
from
time
to
time
year
round
very
delicious
highly
recommend
and
worth
keeping
a
few
on
hand
at
all
times
so
you
can
introduce
friends
to
it
overall
if
you
havent
had
it
go
get
it
and
drink
it
excellent
beer
almost
unmatched
in
its
category
highly
recommended
i
will
buy
it
and
drink
it
again
there
is
a
reason
it
is
the
top
ranked
hefe
on
all
of
ba
o
not
bad
but
certainly
not
the
the
king
of
hefes
perhaps
i
like
my
beers
on
the
maltier
side
a
good
summer
beer
nonetheless
sessionable
this
beer
is
beyond
tried
and
certainly
true
taste
is
very
creamy
to
start
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
peppery
finish
with
slight
alcohol
finish
and
leaves
a
sweet
creamy
aftertaste
very
solid
more
substance
than
white
or
saison
which
have
similar
tastes
for
me
my
go
to
hefeweizen
highly
recommended
the
perfect
hefeweizen
maybe
i
havent
tried
enough
to
say
but
its
definitely
the
best
one
ive
had
pours
a
hazy
gold
colour
with
a
big
beautiful
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
yeast
wheat
malt
banana
and
cloves
tastes
just
like
it
smells
big
wheat
and
yeast
flavour
some
spiciness
wheatmalt
backbone
with
some
green
apples
banana
and
a
bit
of
bubblegum
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
smooth
dry
and
a
bit
tart
overall
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
tasted
this
on
tap
at
uptown
pub
only
had
a
sampling
but
what
i
tasted
was
excellent
would
definitely
get
this
in
the
future
and
i
look
forward
to
doing
a
more
in
depth
review
thick
creamy
head
rich
mouthfeel
banana
clove
and
wheat
flavors
prominent
extremely
smooth
incredibly
balanced
and
thick
mouthfeel
i
cannot
exclaim
that
enough
fantastic
brew
overall
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
hefe
glass
pours
the
color
of
a
fresh
orange
at
first
and
then
when
the
yeast
is
added
it
turns
a
dark
hazy
coppery
orange
color
i
had
to
pour
this
beer
walk
away
and
then
come
back
to
finish
the
pour
the
head
was
huge
fluffy
like
a
giant
cloud
with
no
lacing
left
as
i
drink
it
the
nose
is
very
bright
citrus
orange
coriander
and
white
bread
the
taste
is
again
full
of
bright
citrus
notes
with
banana
and
yeasty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
with
the
a
nice
touch
of
carbonation
very
delightful
overall
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
hefe
that
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
its
a
great
representative
of
the
style
and
hits
all
the
right
points
perfectly
i
will
definitely
stock
this
for
the
summer
this
is
a
relatively
simple
beer
but
it
has
great
strength
in
its
simplicity
the
wheaty
malt
profile
and
the
yeast
come
together
in
a
remarkable
way
the
balance
works
better
than
any
hefeweizen
ive
ever
tasted
seriously
i
should
have
had
this
years
ago
this
is
for
sure
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
smooth
and
wheaty
and
it
hits
perfect
certainly
better
on
tap
but
a
bottle
is
worth
checking
out
light
enough
to
be
loved
by
the
average
drinker
flavorful
enough
to
be
loved
by
the
avid
beer
drinker
this
beer
when
poured
is
a
hazy
bright
orange
in
colour
while
the
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
are
present
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
hints
of
clove
banana
and
even
nutmeg
quite
delicious
and
you
will
definitely
want
to
reach
out
for
another
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
is
as
easy
to
drink
as
its
name
is
hard
to
pronounce
overall
a
fine
beer
but
its
not
my
favorite
weiss
beer
i
didnt
find
that
flavor
making
this
a
really
special
one
like
some
others
do
so
i
find
it
a
bit
overrated
i
prefer
the
konig
ludwig
or
paulaner
over
this
one
also
the
wiehenstephaner
vitus
is
more
like
how
i
like
it
still
a
very
nice
refreshing
and
tasteful
beer
though
4
48
45
pours
exactly
as
expected
a
large
puffy
white
head
and
a
thick
cloudy
body
that
is
yelloworange
a
thin
film
of
white
remains
after
the
head
dissipates
smells
of
bananas
and
other
sweet
things
not
the
slightest
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
or
taste
taste
largely
mirrors
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
offputting
i
feel
it
is
too
carbonated
for
the
style
and
makes
an
otherwise
smooth
brew
a
little
spiky
overall
the
beer
is
a
classic
it
also
makes
for
a
good
summer
beer
nice
and
refreshing
im
impressed
with
the
overall
quality
of
this
beer
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
giving
off
mild
hints
of
banana
but
primarily
hops
malt
and
spices
the
appearance
was
average
but
i
must
say
after
pouring
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
does
leave
behind
a
nice
head
what
i
was
most
impressed
with
was
the
mouthfeel
and
the
unique
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
essentially
no
bitter
points
whatsoever
the
hoppy
smell
threw
me
off
a
little
bit
because
there
are
so
many
other
flavors
that
strike
you
prior
to
the
slight
hop
aftertaste
above
else
cloves
were
the
first
thing
i
could
taste
banana
was
probably
the
second
most
pungent
flavor
followed
by
wheat
yeast
malt
a
bit
of
caramel
and
hops
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
not
one
of
my
favorite
but
definitely
something
different
and
for
its
class
a
very
good
brew
id
give
it
a
810
o
more
than
lives
up
to
the
standards
set
by
their
other
beers
an
absolute
must
have
overall
some
highs
and
some
lows
a
benchmark
of
the
style
but
not
necessarily
my
favorite
i
miss
gasp
dancing
man
wheat
i
picked
up
another
bottle
primarily
to
compare
this
one
sidebyside
with
some
other
german
hefes
schneiderweisse
erdinger
and
paulaner
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
remains
one
of
my
favourite
wheat
beers
of
all
time
and
it
is
easily
my
favourite
hefeweizen
unbelievably
drinkable
absurdly
smooth
and
delicious
as
hell
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
its
not
as
widelydistributedreliably
available
as
the
other
three
in
these
parts
but
i
cant
say
im
surprised
as
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
that
people
should
be
buying
by
the
armful
a
musttry
o
wow
this
was
amazing
i
loved
everything
about
it
the
creamy
mouthfeel
the
delicious
wheat
and
delicate
spices
a
total
favorite
for
relaxing
and
enjoying
a
refined
brew
i
will
definitely
enjoy
this
regularly
originally
reviewed

great
hefe
overall
the
truth
is
this
beer
is
my
favorite
and
should
be
yours
as
well
hefeweizen
with
rich
flavors
and
fullfilling
taste
it
would
be
harder
to
please
any
more
have
one
and
ask
yourself
for
more
salud
smells
and
looks
better
than
it
tastes
which
is
unfortunate
because
it
smells
fantastic
o
an
awesome
beer
that
i
will
not
walk
by
again
a
new
favorite
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
great
for
a
warm
afternoonevening
flavors
well
balanced
to
avoid
any
overpowering
flavors
d
worldclass
hefeweizen
that
i
will
certainly
be
drinking
again
especially
throughout
the
summer
season
oone
of
the
best
hefes
out
there
not
much
more
can
be
said
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
8461
sampled
on
may
20
2012
when
this
brewery
was
founded
in
1040
ad
i
wonder
if
the
very
first
brewmaster
expected
it
would
still
be
around
nearly
1000
years
later
but
with
the
cloudy
heady
pale
yellow
pour
leading
up
to
a
tremendous
aroma
of
pale
malts
banana
clove
and
yeast
i
can
imagine
how
an
11th
century
beer
drinker
must
have
been
refreshed
on
a
warm
medieval
day
the
light
body
is
satisfying
for
the
style
there
is
a
slight
zing
of
citrus
goodness
in
the
taste
with
the
same
flavor
sensations
that
were
introduced
by
way
of
the
nose
it
finishes
clean
and
easy
the
original
is
still
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
maybe
its
seeing
it
in
the
weihenstephan
glass
but
this
beer
looks
fantastic
smell
is
awesome
as
well
perfect
hefeweizen
aroma
of
banana
and
clove
flavor
follows
the
nose
this
pretty
much
epitomizes
what
a
hefeweizen
should
be
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
yearround
easytoget
hefe
in
existence
its
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
very
refreshing
the
only
things
that
hold
this
back
from
a
higher
score
are
that
1
hefeweizens
arent
my
favorite
style
and
2
its
not
quite
on
the
level
of
my
two
favorite
hefes
the
andechs
and
the
live
oak
an
epic
hefe
not
sure
if
i
prefer
this
one
over
the
schneider
edelweisse
but
its
always
been
damn
tasty
even
better
ontap
hope
i
can
find
a
bartender
to
pour
me
one
this
summer
4
5
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
would
really
be
good
outside
on
a
summer
day
i
dont
drink
this
style
much
but
will
be
picking
up
more
as
the
weather
gets
nicer
looking
forward
to
trying
more
wheat
beers
to
see
how
they
compare
overall
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
this
would
be
enjoyable
with
almost
any
meal
or
in
any
weather
overall
impressively
savory
and
pleasant
surprisingly
bold
considering
the
style
and
abv
the
best
ive
had
o
everything
i
used
to
regularly
get
out
of
a
franziskaner
but
more
refined
and
not
bmc
owned
really
nothing
revolutionary
here
just
tradition
done
well
my
new
goto
weissbier
drinkability
great
late
spring
throughout
summer
wheat
beer
some
much
more
refreshing
than
the
pyramid
hefe
i
had
earlier
today
ive
had
this
beer
plenty
before
but
never
got
around
to
a
seated
rating
o
fantastic
hefe
i
have
not
had
better
in
the
style
i
recently
came
back
to
this
style
after
years
of
disregarding
it
this
hefe
is
well
put
together
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
drink
o
very
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
oh
wait
that
is
what
i
did
when
i
was
in
bavaria
this
is
my
favorite
hefeweizen
and
it
is
a
style
i
really
enjoy
this
is
delicious
and
a
great
beer
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
towering
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
there
is
excellent
head
retention
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
yeast
with
banana
and
citrus
its
a
bold
and
inviting
smell
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
beer
smells
it
has
flavors
of
wheat
and
barley
malts
yeast
citrus
and
banana
theres
a
mild
spiciness
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
the
body
is
light
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
a
great
example
of
this
style
o
a
nice
hefeweizen
if
i
ever
want
a
hefeweizen
again
this
is
one
i
would
go
for
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
there
are
better
refreshing
styles
out
there
in
my
opinion
overall
great
hefeweizen
would
love
to
do
side
by
side
tests
against
my
favourite
of
this
style
paulaner
very
tasty
and
refreshing
you
could
easy
go
through
four
or
five
of
these
without
realizing
would
recommend
o
perhaps
the
best
hefe
ive
had
not
overly
complex
or
strong
just
a
great
combination
of
balanced
flavors
drinkability
is
off
the
scale
goes
down
so
easily
its
scary
best
hefe
on
the
planet
nectar
of
the
gods
doa
this
is
beer
that
makes
you
happy
its
the
perfect
german
beer
not
super
complex
but
never
boring
either
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
drinking
a
lot
of
o
brings
back
great
memories
of
my
time
in
germany
an
excellent
hefe
from
an
historic
brewery
my
only
prior
experience
with
weihenstephan
was
their
collaboration
with
sam
adams
to
create
infinium
a
less
than
promising
first
impression
to
be
sure
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
this
beer
whenever
i
get
the
craving
for
a
hefe
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
an
easy
drinker
probably
my
favorite
hefe
great

a

of
what
an
iconic

can
achieve
overall
a
great
go
to
beer
especially
on
a
warm
day
one
of
the
most
refreshing
and
one
id
love
to
try
fresher
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
hefeweizen
a
great
beer
overall
especially
if
you
be
lucky
enough
to
taste
it
fresh
finally
i
found
this
i
had
heard
so
much
about
it
here
and
elsewhere
as
the
undisputed
champ
of
hefes
so
there
it
was
at
the
bar
out
of
nowhere
and
i
pounced
on
it
hmm
well
it
was
fine
but
i
dont
get
all
the
crazy
praise
for
it
it
was
good
but
didnt
do
much
more
for
me
than
other
hefes
which
im
starting
to
have
my
doubts
about
im
wondering
if
the
style
is
a
narrow
one
in
which
the
differences
between
different
offerings
are
small
if
you
served
this
to
me
id
be
happy
enough
but
rather
than
buy
it
again
id
rather
explore
other
untried
options
i
will
say
it
had
a
very
pretty
snowy
white
head
seems
like
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
was
let
down
that
it
wasnt
crazy
turbo
good
like
the
hype
suggested
or
maybe
im
just
not
a
hefe
guy
i
am
not
a
beer
master
but
i
have
had
my
fair
share
much
more
than
i
have
had
a
chance
to
review
for
this
site
and
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
phenomenal
i
bought
it
from
atlantic
liquors
in
rehoboth
beach
delaware
funny
website
ridiculous
store
not
knowing
what
a
reputation
it
had
very
surprised
when
i
first
tasted
it
then
i
came
here
to
review
and
saw
the
scores
it
had
received
what
a
great
beer
a
must
try
no
matter
what
your
likes
or
experiences
in
the
world
of
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
light
body
but
very
full
flavored
and
nice
medium
carbonation
pour
carefully
great
great
beer
ill
be
drinking
this
a
lot
this
summer
a
crisp
sour
sting
of
carbonation
with
some
light
lemony
notes
hits
up
front
backed
by
banana
notes
giving
way
to
an
olive
smoothness
followed
by
a
nutty
round
mouth
feel
with
wheat
notes
slight
fruit
notes
are
detected
in
some
of
the
bitterness
like
the
bite
of
raspberry
without
any
of
the
sweetness
this
is
a
delightfully
complex
beer
perfect
for
a
warm
evening
d
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
hefe
incredibly
easy
drinking
with
good
flavors
not
groundbreaking
or
entirely
remarkable
but
a
very
good
beer
o
the
first
weiss
bier
ive
had
very
tasty
a
very
good
overall
weizen
with
a
good
head
and
taste
the
head
is
produced
with
very
fine
bubbles
a
mark
of
a
very
good
brew
a
fair
amount
of
hefe
but
not
a
lot
not
as
spicy
as
weizen
in
wester
bayern
so
far
the
best
one
i
have
found
that
is
available
in
the
usa
i
am
having
several
right
now
overall
oh
goodness
this
is
one
hell
of
a
hefeweizen
i
feel
sorry
for
the
people
who
get
widmer
hef
and
think
thats
the
end
all
be
all
of
wheat
beers
this
is
a
worldclass
hef
and
a
benchmark
for
the
style
o
nice
offering
i
was
drawn
to
this
by
their
advertising
as
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
glad
i
picked
some
up
it
was
nice
to
try
something
out
of
my
comfort
zone
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
am
looking
forward
to
more
of
these
bad
boys
as
spring
springs
a
this
is
one
highly
regarded
beer
that
is
easily
available
to
most
people
the
price
of
a
bottle
makes
it
look
even
better
compared
to
a
lot
of
beers
theres
a
reason
weihenstephan

the
king

hefe
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
one
of
these
is
certainly
in
order
a
very
well
done
hefeweizen
definitely
a
classic
overall
a
o
utterly
drinkable
and
quality
brew
truly
a
remarkable
beer
overall
its
all
about
preference
this
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
hefeweizen
its
still
relatively
easydrinking
but
its
a
bit
more
fuller
and
bolder
in
taste
and
that
makes
this
great
in
its
own
way
you
wont
be
disappointed
here
probably
the
best
purest
most
balanced
hefeweizen
i
have
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
stellar
beer
that
surpasses
anything
i
have
had
in
the
style
and
maybe
from
the
country
itself
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
within
its
style
i
see
no
way
that
they
could
improve
it
overall
this
got
me
onto
weissbiers
but
ive
tried
loads
since
then
and
this
is
pretty
unremarkable
compared
to
a
lot
of
others
in
my
opinion
its
one
of
the
most
overrated
beers
on
ba
bought
this
last
night
from
tanakaya
in
mejiro
tokyo
excited
about
this
one
because
i
saw
it
has
the
highest
ranking
for
hefes
here
on
ba
did
not
disappoint
poured
it
into
a
new
paulaner
hefe
glass
also
purchased
at
tanakaya
and
enjoyed
enjoyed
enjoyed
the
head
on
this
is
ridiculously
amazing
delicious
and
longlasting
lacing
the
glass
like
a
frappe
loved
watching
all
the
particles
float
around
in
the
glass
heightening
the
smell
of
orange
and
wheat
and
the
taste
of
the
same
the
only
thing
i
could
ask
for
is
a
bit
thicker
of
a
brew
just
to
give
my
tongue
something
else
to
play
with
other
than
that
this
is
the
best
hefe
i
have
ever
had
and
especially
for
the
price
relatively
cheap
i
will
be
a
fan
of
this
for
life
get
it

lingers
and

extremely
well
right
on

great
taste
that
just
cleans
you
palate
with
every
drink
great
subtle
hint
of
all
the
flavors
from
the
nose
then
i
pick
up
a
great
bready
flavor
along
with
a
wheat
taste
that
comes
with
every
beer
in
this
style
this
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
amount
of
carbonation
but
nothing
out
of
line
with
the
style
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
this
style
all
other
hefes
get
compared
to
this
this
beer
is
the
gold
standard
of
hefes
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
is
a
textbook
example
of
a
classic
hef
that
achieves
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
poured
into
a
belgian
hefeweissbier
glass
the
beer
stands
tall
with
a
pure
white
soft
bubbly
foam
head
that
tantalizes
you
to
take
a
sip
upon
first
sip
one
instantly
recognizes
that
hearty
wheat
flavor
combined
with
a
comfortable
relaxed
light
body
mouth
feel
that
is
extremely
satisfying
after
a
few
sips
one
begins
to
appreciate
the
subtle
complexity
of
the
beer
with
orange
and
light
citrus
hints
as
well
as
the
classic
german
yeastymalty
flavor
perfect
beer
with
a
light
meal
or
on
its
own
one
never
tires
of
a
cold
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
o
its
one
hell
of
a
beer
quite
possibly
the
best
for
the
style
very
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
it
has
a
slight
lean
towards
the
bitterness
of
earthy
hops
and
yeast
than
most
but
in
my
opinion
is
the
epitomy
of
german
weisse
bier
overall
outstanding
hefeweizen
in
every
single
category
this
beer
by
far
ranks
up
there
at
the
top
of
its
class
at
only
5
4
abv
this
makes
for
the
perfect
flavorful
allyearround
session
beer
i
can
imagine
this
being
quite
the
quencher
during
the
summer
months
but
if
im
being
totally
honest
im
enjoying
the
heck
out
of
this
in
the
middle
of
february
im
glad
i
committed
to
buying
a
few
bottles
of
this
well
done
weihenstephaner
well
done
o
this
is
another
fantastic
german
wit
i
am
biased
because
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
the
german
subtitles
and
balance
really
make
me
excited
in
comparison
to
the
belgian
strength
and
extremes
i
align
more
so
with
balances
and
crisp
flavor
than
over
the
top
yeast
attributes
this
is
the
hef
this
is
the
standard
that
everything
else
is
compared
to
and
often
fails
overall
i
thought
for
sure
this
beer
was
overhyped
when
buying
it
i
was
dead
wrong
this
beer
looks
great
smells
great
feels
great
and
establishes
an
almost
unrivaled
balance
hands
down
the
best
hefeweizen
the
germans
invented
the
style
and
they
sure
do
know
how
to
make
em
the
only
american
hefe
that
comes
close
is
sns
kellerweiss
light
bodied
and
full
of
flavor
with
none
of
the
off
tastes
that
inferior
beers
of
the
style
so
often
have
i
feel
pity
for
the
person
who
lets
blue
moon
be
the
beginning
and
end
of
their
foray
into
wheat
beers
if
the
head
had
held
up
better
and
the
smells
had
hit
harder
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
i
long
for
the
day
i
can
try
this
one
fresh
at
the
brewery
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
considered
the
gold
standard
for
hefes
it
really
is
an
awesome
beer
on
a
side
note
its
interesting
that
this
brewer
of
a
wheat
beer
makes
the
claim
brewed
under
the
purity
law
of
1516
when
wheat
was
specifically
forbidden
by
that
law
but
i
guess
it
sounds
better
for
marketing
than
saying
brewed
under
the
provisional
german
beer
law
of
1993
on
the
palate
the
weihenstephaner
is
flavorful
and
complex
yet
so
incredible
easy
to
drink
the
citrus
and
banana
is
right
up
front
in
my
mouth
but
not
far
behind
is
the
spice
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
is
an
absolutely
delicious
brew
that
i
highly
recommend
for
anyone
who
ever
considered
those
mediocre
massproduced
imitations
oa
delicious
and
complex
beer
with
great
balance
overall
its
a
very
good
hefe
im
not
sure
i
would
consider
it
the
44th
best
beer
in
the
world
and
in
the
style
i
like
dry
dock
hefe
more
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
with
a
bottle
i
know
is
fresh
o
the
fact
that
i
can
get
this
beer
locally
for
less
than
2
50
will
lead
me
to
have
it
more
and
more
often
while
this
is
rated
as
the
best
hefe
i
would
rank
it
number
2
behind
dancing
man
by
new
glarus
which
has
a
more
prominent
banana
flavor
and
more
subtle
clove
flavor
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
well
done
as
one
would
expect
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
overallill
admit
like
many
of
you
im
a
sucker
for
high
abv
beers
eyecatching
labels
and
any
local
craft
beer
the
weihenstephaner
is
none
of
these
it
is
one
of
those
landmark
beers
that
defines
this
delicious
beverage
as
we
know
it
o
this
is
the
best
hefeweizen
ive
ever
had
very
subtle
and
easy
to
drink
ive
put
it
off
for
a
long
time
because
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
fantastic
it
is
indeed
world
class
o
looks
amazing
smells
and
tastes
great
mouthfeel
is
the
one
weakness
but
its
still
really
good
great
beer
love
it
o
the
default
top
tier
example
of
a
german
hefe
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
perfect
two
finger
white
head
great
lacing
and
great
carbonation
hazy
in
appearance
the
nose
is
amazing
wheat
yeast
lemon
and
malt
taste
follows
the
nose
profile
feel
is
just
about
perfect
sweet
with
a
perfect
malt
backbone
and
refreshing
finish
theres
a
reason
this
is
1
beer
in
style
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
for
a
hefeweizen
cheers
o
very
nice
beer
id
buy
it
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
have
drank
many
since
my
original
tasting
definitely
a
must
drink
as
a
great
cornerstone
of
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
overall
this
is
hands
down
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
and
per
style
is
almost
perfect
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
on
the
nose
but
i
am
just
nit
picking
at
this
point
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
considered
the
best
hefeweizen
on
the
face
of
the
earth
incredible
if
you
want
an
archetype
of
the
hefeweissen
style
this
is
it
pours
a
beautiful
deep
yellow
gold
color
that
leaves
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
smells
of
wheat
banana
citrus
taste
is
on
point
for
a
hefe
nicely
balanced
wheat
citrus
banana
and
a
light
bitterness
at
the
end
everything
about
this
beer
in
the
taste
department
is
done
brilliantly
mouthfeel
is
good
fairly
light
overall
and
easy
to
drink
a
pint
or
two
all
in
all
if
you
want
a
good
hefe
this
is
the
one
to
go
to
overall
great
beer
so
worth
the
price
under
4
and
could
drink
it
anytime
m
medium
bodied
very
smooth
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
it
doesnt
get
any
better
then
this
its
about
time
i
sit
down
with
one
of
these
and
enjoy
the
experience
out
loud
this
looks
like
a
beer
should
look
when
poured
hazy
straw
colored
with
a
solid
2
finger
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
and
carbonation
filling
the
glass
its
smells
of
citrus
and
funk
and
makes
your
mouth
water
the
wheat
flavor
is
up
front
with
good
funk
finishing
up
with
a
crisp
refeshing
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
floral
at
the
end
this
is
well
done
and
could
stand
up
nexrt
to
just
about
anythings
the
state
try
and
produce
in
this
wheat
variety

incredible
wheat
beer

the
definition
of
a
hefeweizen
