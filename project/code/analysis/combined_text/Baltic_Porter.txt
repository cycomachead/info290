my
favorite
sixpoint
brew
so
of
course
they
changed
it
its
got
the
advertised
smoothness
though
for
all
the
beans
id
expect
a
more
silky
touch
it
is
creamy
and
quite
lush
though
and
it
doesnt
lack
as
the
full
body
rolls
on
the
tongue
with
a
smooth
and
easy
carbonation
offering
just
enough
of
a
bite
with
a
focus
working
toward
that
velvety
feeling
alcohol
adds
a
prickle
but
not
much
more
and
it
blends
well
reminds
me
slightly
of
victory
at
sea
but
not
as
full
in
flavor
and
luscious
still
a
fantastic
coffee
brew
even
with
over
a
year
on
it
o
not
the
average
stout
this
one
has
some
bite
to
it
a
bit
of
an
olde
ale
flavor
all
3
75s
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
doesnt
taste
or
drink
like
10
but
it
is
really
good
i
am
sure
it
was
better
fresh
with
the
huge
coffee
arome
and
flavor
people
describe
would
have
liked
to
get
this
fresh
but
what
can
you
do
very
solid
though
o
im
going
to
miss
this
beer
sixpoint
bring
this
back
this
is
an
amazing
coffeechocolate
porter
that
hides
its
10
punch
its
balanced
its
different
and
its
amazing
a
great
baltic
porter
and
a
truly
great
use
of
coffee
here
it
stands
tall
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
burnt
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
nothing
special
here
glad
i
only
picked
up
a
single
can
oa
damn
good
porter
probably
my
favorite
so
far
but
i
have
not
had
a
porter
in
a
few
months
so
ill
have
to
try
some
more
roasted
coffee
notes
taste
exceptional
and
the
bitterness
is
rounded
out
well
with
the
faint
molasses
taste
as
i
often
seem
to
notice
the
alcohol
tasteburn
is
a
little
more
present
when
the
beer
is
colder
than
suggested
for
the
style
there
is
a
little
bite
at
the
end
as
the
beer
comes
to
temp
however

dark
brown
pour
with
a
creamy
two
finger
beige
head
with
great
retention
and
crazy
lacing
this
nose
is
very
malt
forward
with
lots
of
sweet
roasty
coffee
notes
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
mocha
caramel
brown
sugar
and
some
subtle
hazelnut
the
taste
follows
suit
with
lots
of
fresh
roasty
coffee
up
front
along
with
hints
of
hazelnut
vanilla
caramel
brown
sugar
cocoa
and
brown
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
above
average
carbonation
and
a
bittersweet
slightly
dry
finish
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
overall
a
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
interpretation
lastly
go
out
into
some
snow
maybe
snowboard
ski
or
go
for
a
slay
ride
and
appreciate
that
the
biggest
mistake
made
by
the
sixpoint
brewery
was
releasing
such
a
wintery
porter
in
the
middle
of
summer
when
it
could
not
be
appreciated
for
the
atmosphere
that
it
provides
o
got
a
4pack
of
this
for
4
dollars
on
sale
noticed
its
best
by
date
was
5
months
ago
but
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
the
alcohol
seems
to
be
taking
over
and
would
like
to
try
fresher
some
time
still
as
it
is
a
nice
beer
with
complexity
the
taste
tends
to
play
down
the
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
of
the
nose
in
favor
of
a
dark
malt
earthy
fruity
character
oh
yes
the
chocolate
and
coffee
do
not
disappear
entirely
but
they
dont
present
themselves
as
much
in
the
flavor
as
they
do
in
the
aroma
10
abv
and
the
alcohol
is
not
detected
decent
porter
prost
ive
had
my
eye
on
this
beer
since
the
day
id
first
seen
it
im
not
sure
why
being
as
sixpoint
has
never
shown
me
much
in
the
past
3beans
falls
in
line
with
the
rest
of
sixpoints
offerings
ive
sampled
its
good
but
with
the
selection
today
i
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
a
four
pack
is
more
than
enough
for
me
can
poured
a
dark
clear
brown
color
beer
with
a
generous
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
sublime
coffee
notes
with
wellbalanced
caramelized
malt
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
great
coffee
beans
notes
with
almost
no
astringency
or
overly
dry
notes
malt
backbone
is
solid
with
good
caramelized
notes
and
no
overly
dry
roasted
malt
notes
with
light
residual
sugar
notes
body
is
lighter
then
i
was
expecting
for
a
10
abv
beer
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
find
it
hard
to
distinguish
the
porter
and
thought
this
was
more
akin
to
a
strong
brown
ale
with
loads
of
coffee
overall
personally
it
felt
mishmashed
and
muddled
with
some
noted
coarseness
this
is
a
relaxing
beer
that
develops
with
warmth
while
unwinding
in
the
early
evening
o
nice
rich
aroma
with
great
chocolate
malt
and
coffee
and
that
follows
through
for
the
most
part
in
the
taste
goes
down
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hidden
but
has
nice
alcohol
heat
as
it
opens
this
beer
is
simply
great
the
romano
beans
gave
the
beer
a
wonderful
texture
to
allow
the
coffee
and
cacao
beans
to
meld
and
mutate
into
something
that
wasnt
your
typical
coffee
stoutporter
3beans
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
substantial
khaki
head
the
aroma
was
a
perfect
buttery
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
to
round
it
out
let
this
brew
warm
because
it
holds
a
tang
when
its
too
cold
but
releases
into
a
roasted
dark
chocolate
coffee
wonderland
when
it
warms
o
nothing
too
outrageous
but
a
fine
goto
baltic
fun
to
drink
strong
but
hidden
and
good
flavor
4

o
a
very
good
coffeeforward
porter
that
packs
as
much
flavor
as
a
stout
drinks
nowhere
near
its
high
abv
and
balances
nicely
with
the
coffee
beans
and
cocao
deep
reddish
brown
body
and
two
plus
finger
thick
foamy
head
made
this
beer
look
nice
in
the
pint
glass
the
can
it
came
in
was
well
designed
as
well
the
smell
that
the
beer
emitted
was
a
heavenly
mix
of
chocolate
coffee
and
hops
i
didnt
even
need
to
bring
the
glass
to
my
nose
to
smell
this
the
taste
was
out
of
this
world
with
a
perfect
balance
between
sweet
chocolate
toffee
dark
cherries
and
figs
and
bitter
coffee
hops
and
burnt
toast
flavors
there
was
hint
of
lactic
sourness
in
the
finish
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
at
first
with
and
astringent
punch
at
the
end
freaking
outstanding
introduction
to
this
brewery
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
a
very
nice
coffee
flavor
here
with
some
quality
coffee
obviously
used
its
also
quite
silky
in
the
mouth
which
is
very
pleasant
the
only
thing
im
not
sure
of
is
the
presence
of
sort
of
a
chalky
graininess
that
intrudes
on
the
flavors
a
bit
its
not
bad
but
it
makes
the
beer
a
bit
heavy
and
sort
of
simple
compared
to
the
more
nuances
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
i
think
two
beans
would
have
been
preferable
here
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
probably
hands
down
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
to
date
sixpoint
seemed
to
do
everything
right
with
this
offering
this
was
a
real
treat
tried
the
sixpoint
2beans
at
the
local
tap
house
grill
the
beer
poured
a
dark
opaque
with
slightly
off
white
head
that
left
a
very
nice
lace
the
scent
and
taste
were
dominated
by
coffeeespresso
there
was
enough
malt
and
hop
to
balance
the
astringent
acidic
yield
of
the
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
full
body
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nice
baltic
coffee
porter
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
as
sixpoint
does
a
lot
well
but
this
could
have
been
improved
still
decent
though
and
for
the
price
worth
giving
it
a
shot
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
2
finger
foamy
greytan
head
decent
lacing
smell
mildly
sweet
cocoa
and
coffee
with
piney
hops
in
the
background
taste
sweet
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
molasses
up
front
followed
by
roasted
coffee
and
a
nice
woody
character
in
the
middle
before
ending
with
a
high
amount
of
bitter
piney
hops
at
the
finish
aftertaste
is
roasted
very
bitter
and
quite
longlasting
mouthfeel
fullbodied
with
a
fairly
high
amount
of
carbonation
not
quite
as
thick
and
creamy
as
i
would
have
wanted
the
hop
oils
really
coat
the
mouth
drinkability
good
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
but
its
one
youll
enjoy
until
the
last
drop
overall
very
good
beer
overall
i
like
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
one
while
i
dont
think
its
a
home
run
its
still
a
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
especially
to
the
hopheads
out
there
overall
4
55
sixpoint
3beans
is
an
exceptional
beer
this
brew
isnt
special
just
because
it
uses
unusual
ingredients
its
a
masterwork
of
intense
flavor
and
carefully
considered
implementation
of
ingredients
i
must
emphasize
the
mouthfeel
is
something
to
behold
this
stuff
goes
down
like
a
chocolate
shake
this
is
the
best
beer
of
sixpoints
that
ive
had
wonderful
overall
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
with
great
typical
cocoa
notes
light
body
and
some
bitterness
was
a
little
surprising
but
its
super
tastey
o
nicely
balanced
brew
and
good
use
of
flavors
to
accentuate
this
style
tastefeel
when
i
first
got
it
it
just
tasted
like
a
somewhat
bland
cold
coffee
definitely
needed
to
warm
up
after
it
warmed
up
wow
massive
coffee
complimentary
dark
chocolate
and
a
moderate
amount
of
warming
in
the
throat
from
the
alcohol
this
seems
to
be
a
fairly
popular
morning
beer
here
on
beeradvocate
but
this
worked
well
for
me
as
a
nightcap
i
will
say
that
i
did
certainly
enjoy
3beans
but
the
alcohol
isnt
masked
quite
as
well
as
id
like
it
to
be
o
a
stout
meant
to
highlight
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
and
it
does
it
well
delicious
coffee
and
chocolate
for
that
matter
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
and
complementary
as
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
even
if
its
a
little
bit
of
a
onenote
twonote
beer
my
kind
of
notes
though
o
overall
its
a
good
beer
it
has
some
excellent
qualities
that
cocoa
chocolate
on
the
nose
is
wonderful
but
the
off
flavors
bring
the
rating
down
on
this
one
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
tough
if
offered
again
in
the
future
i
would
likely
partake
poured
a
mahogany
dark
brown
with
lace
patches
on
glass
and
a
mostly
roasted
coffee
and
some
dark
chocolate
aromas
although
possibly
some
dark
fruit
when
it
doubt
black
cherries
although
not
really
any
tart
or
bitterness
from
aroma
full
bodied
thick
a
little
sticky
still
goes
down
easy
the
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
and
something
akin
to
molasses
or
even
syrup
i
guess
licorice
could
be
here
instead
but
im
not
sure
sweetness
blend
together
for
a
coffee
like
stout
that
maintains
a
java
like
sweetness
as
you
progress
through
the
can
and
its
a
sipper
mind
you
the
alcohol
and
heat
come
into
play
more
and
the
coffee
beans
are
more
pronounced
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
sip
on
for
your
nightcap
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
hue
solid
head
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
roasted
malt
and
coffee
accentuated
with
some
chocolate
notes
flavor
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
like
it
smells
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
cheers
o
not
particularly
feeling
this
one
decent
but
alcohol
and
bitterness
overpower
maybe
better
with
some
age
on
it
overall
a
big
porter
with
attitude
that
being
said
i
could
still
enjoy
2
pints
of
this
easily
before
it
knocks
me
off
a
chair
o
a
decent
offering
from
6p
this
is
sort
of
like
a
super
alcoholic
energy
drink
good
for
what
it
is
which
is
a
blend
of
beer
and
coffee
probably
wouldnt
spend
the
money
on
another
4pack
though
i
have
only
had
a
few
baltic
porters
but
this
one
may
be
the
best
it
fits
the
style
description
almost
perfectly
with
the
bitter
roasty
notes
playing
first
chair
and
the
complementary
sweet
andor
fruity
flavors
all
relegated
to
the
rear
a
nice
complex
and
hearty
beer
from
can
to
tulip
pours
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
creamy
looking
one
finger
khaki
head
aroma
of
nutty
coffee
roasted
malt
and
ashiness
nose
is
a
little
thin
flavor
is
roasted
makes
and
a
hint
of
earthy
coffee
really
this
falls
a
little
flat
for
me
at
first
and
was
very
thin
for
an
imperial
porter
seems
to
pick
up
as
i
sip
through
and
might
be
better
on
the
warmer
side
medium
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
meh
not
bad
but
wont
return
to
this
one
pours
dark
brown
and
from
a
vigorous
pour
i
got
a
tall
ample
head
of
mocha
colored
foam
that
fell
to
some
sticky
lace
just
a
little
light
around
the
edges
makes
it
look
like
cola
nose
is
delicious
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
caramel
malt
smells
roasty
and
cold
malt
is
prominent
and
sweet
in
the
nose
but
hides
a
bit
of
bread
i
cant
wait
to
taste
it
oh
delight
coffee
smooth
chocolate
some
warming
alcohol
and
little
toast
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
creamy
there
is
good
earth
and
a
little
bitter
from
the
hops
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
on
the
back
palate
that
makes
this
seem
very
decadent
the
coffee
is
extremely
well
done
and
not
the
slightest
bit
burnt
the
cocoa
is
like
silk
up
next
to
it
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
prominent
to
call
it
smooth
but
it
rounds
out
with
hints
of
vanilla
as
it
warms
the
bread
in
this
is
mild
and
really
well
done
truly
great
overall
very
good
beer
overall
i
like
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
one
while
i
dont
think
its
a
home
run
its
still
a

i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
especially
to
the
hopheads
out
there
very
nice
worth
seeking
out
as
rich
as
many
imperial
stouts
cheers
d
this
was
a
decent
double
stout
with
a
great
scent
and
body
but
the
taste
wasnt
anything
special
and
the
finish
was
really
rough
so
it
wasnt
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
age
would
help
improve
but
this
brew
was
only
mediocre
fresh

d

has

with
all
their
offerings
and
this
is
no
exception
lots
of
everything
in

produces

here
excellent
o
very
dry
on
the
mouth
feel
with
not
enough
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
flavors
that
i
associate
with
a
good
baltic
porter
it
needs
a
touch
more
roast
and
some
body
as
well
o
well
theres
good
news
and
bad
news
bad
news
first
with
a
name
like
3beans
i
thought
this
would
blow
me
away
with
coffeedominated
flavor
which
didnt
quite
happen
good
news
i
instantly
didnt
care
because
this
is
a
delicious
and
extremely
well
crafted
brew
in
a
nutshell
this
really
is
a
sum
of
all
parts
with
a
beautiful
balance
of
all
components
thats
enjoyableeasy
to
drink
and
very
deceptive
in
the
alcohol
department
ill
absolutely
enjoy
this
again
overall
pretty
solid
baltic
porter
and
in
a
can
o
a
balanced
pleasurable
stoutporter
where
is
the
alcohol
it
really
drinks
like
a
5
abv
porter
3beans
is
a
prime
candidate
for
a
sippingdessert
beer
but
it
also
goes
down
really
easy
my
advice
is
to
take
your
time
with
this
one
i
expected
a
bit
more
heft
in
the
body
but
overall
its
a
well
crafted
flavorful
beer
o
finally
a
sixpoint
that
i
really
like
this
is
great
right
in
line
with
the
recent
dayman
and
espresso
ris
i
loved
the
combination
and
concept
here
probably
because
it
was
perfectly
executed
now
this
is
how
you
do
chocolate
and
coffee
in
a
beer
i
havent
had
many
baltic
porters
but
this
one
was
top
notch
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
above
average
solid
shrug
just
a
mite
bit
nondescript
raul
likes
this
raul
likes
this
a
lot
taste
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
coffee
and
cocoa
with
a
soft
grassy
hop
bite
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
goes
down
really
smooth
this
is
top
notch
actually
as
far
as
nonbomber
imperial
stoutporter
offerings
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
to
drop
13
bones
on
a
4pack
but
am
glad
i
did
so
now
and
might
even
go
pick
up
another
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
along
with
a
silky
body
is
quite
impressive
the
legumes
do
seem
to
add
a
richer
texture
especially
if
this
is
indeed
a
porter
it
gives
it
a
more
stoutesque
character
overall
not
quite
the
smooth
stout
but
overall
a
good
stout
overall
i
traded
for
this
and
was
by
far
the
most
ive
spent
on
a
beer
after
shipping
costs
about
9
for
12oz
and
it
was
completely
worth
it
this
is
just
fantastic
o
the
booze
is
well
masked
and
this
beer
certainly
has
a
unique
flavor
although
nothing
that
i
will
regret
forgoing
in
the
future
so
overall
an
interesting
beer
it
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
of
the
concept
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
chocolate
and
coffee
strong
ale
worth
trying
overall
i
am
going
away
from
this
very
disappointed
as
a
lover
of
many
imperial
stouts
some
overly
hoppy
others
chocolaty
many
just
run
of
the
mill
this
one
does
deliver
everything
but
fails
to
be
more
than
just
a
homebrew
effort
that
doesnt
deserve
such
high
praise
looked
like
coffee
smelled
like
coffee
tasted
like
coffee
but
its
not
a
coffee
dont
let
the
small
can
fool
you
its
not
the
size
of
the
can
that
matters
its
what
is
on
the
inside
that
matters
this
beer
packs
a
big
dry
roasted
coffee
punch
if
you
like
your
coffee
beers
then
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
seek
this
one
out
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
cans
this
is
a
very
interesting
unique
beer
i
give
kudos
to
sixpoint
for
pushing
the
envelope
yet
again
that
said
i
feel
this
is
a
touch
too
bitter
and
unbalanced
toward
the
coffee
side
to
be
truly
great
at
the
current
price
point
of
13
for
a
4
pack
ill
be
passing
in
the
future
overall
pretty
good
but
not
mind
blowing
if
youre
a
fan
of
porters
or
coffee
stouts
its
definitely
worth
a
try
great
coffee
beer
here
o
a
fine
brew
from
sixpoint
one
i
would
enjoy
when
looking
for
an
easy
to
drink
coffee
brew
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
coffee
to
it
but
a
solid
drinker
none
the
less
overy
nice
well
balanced
and
full
flavored
porter
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
given
all
of
the
hype
around
this
beer
to
me
it
seemed
like
this
beer
was
highly
sought
after
but
in
high
supply
not
a
bad
beer
its
a
good
coffee
and
chocolate
blend
in
a
solid
dark
beer
but
nothing
special
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
ive
been
to
the
brewery
so
drinking
these
always
remind
me
of
my
trip
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
pitch
black
with
a
large
light
brown
head
smells
of
coffee
coffee
and
did
i
mention
coffee
also
smells
of
chocolate
tastes
of
coffee
coffee
and
chocolate
very
deep
taste
but
sweeter
than
expected
with
the
smell
heavy
body
but
it
is
still
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
just
right
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
this
brewery
just
keeps
making
some
solid
good
stuff
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
actually
wish
i
bought
two
4
packs
instead
of
just
one
really
enjoyed
this
brew
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
a
dry
bitter
and
robust
coffee
presence
that
lingers
over
the
dark
malt
profile
into
a
bone
dry
finish
some
dry
oak
and
dark
chocolate
flavor
complimented
by
espresso
bean
and
burnt
toast
subtle
lactic
presence
and
subtle
sweetness
balance
things
out
lots
of
coffee
flavor
but
not
a
one
dimensional
coffee
bomb
dry
and
acrid
but
easy
to
drink
because
the
high
abv
is
nicely
masked
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
very
interesting
either
o
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
very
complex
for
this
style
and
i
wanted
another
overall
i
think
the
booziness
of
this
beer
really
comes
and
undoes
all
the
other
good
stuff
that
sixpoint
did
with
this
brew
it
makes
me
wonder
if
they
dumped
sugar
into
the
brew
to
get
their
og
up
as
it
tastes
rather
dry
and
boozy
itd
be
a
decent
baltic
porter
otherwise
but
i
really
cant
bring
myself
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
even
though
ill
probably
continue
on
and
finish
this
one
3
apparently
i
like
to
buy
new
sixpoint
beers
because
i
like
complaining
this
was
almost
very
good
the
aroma
is
solid
and
the
chocolate
notes
are
great
unfortunately
the
coffee
combined
with
the
oak
aging
doesnt
quite
work
here
still
worth
a
try
o
too
darn
big
i
think
3beans
could
be
a
decent
beer
if
the
alcohol
was
a
lot
less
obvious
perhaps
some
aging
a
longer
lagering
or
even
a
lager
yeast
instead
of
ale
would
go
a
long
way
too
o
lots
of
coffee
and
not
much
else
to
get
in
its
way
overall
for
a
domestic
baltic
porter
this
is
not
bad
this
has
got
a
lot
of
the
black
coffee
taste
that
i
was
expecting
this
beer
is
rich
and
solid
and
a
must
for
a
coffee
drinker
that
said
i
prefer
my
tea
and
while
i
am
happy
to
have
one
i
think
the
four
pack
would
be
a
bit
much
for
me
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
it
has
the
intense
coffee
notes
that
i
was
anticipating
and
the
cacao
made
its
presence
known
these
two
notes
are
very
good
however
there
was
a
faint
grainy
aftertaste
as
well
as
a
burning
alcohol
presence
which
really
slowed
down
the
drinking
experience
for
me
in
the
end
this
was
still
an
enjoyable
offering
that
i
will
definitely
try
to
get
my
hands
on
again
oa
wonderful
coffee
beer
the
10
is
well
hidden
o
a
coffee
lovers
dream
if
you
want
a
coffee
beer
i
would
choose
this
over
other
coffee
porters
and
even
founders
breakfast
stout
this
is
one
smooth
beer
and
very
enjoyable
one
if
you
like
coffee
and
roasty
porters
quite
a
good
offering
from
sixpoint
i
wish
they
would
make
this
a
permanent
addition
to
their
line
up
poured
from
the
can
a
deep
mahagony
with
well
defined
half
finger
light
tan
colored
heada
little
lighter
in
color
than
most
i
have
had
from
the
style
aromas
of
dark
roast
coffeebitter
chocolateand
earthit
seems
quite
dry
and
no
alcohol
sweetness
starts
out
with
deep
coffee
roast
with
underlying
unsweetened
chocolatemild
molasseslike
sweetness
that
quickly
gets
hit
with
a
healthy
dose
of
piney
hops
in
the
finish
this
is
a
hopped
up
baltic
porterone
of
the
dryer
and
complex
of
the
style
i
have
hadits
just
a
little
sharp
in
the
feel
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
well
balanced
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
a
really
nice
beer
sixpoint
is
solid
and
so
is
this
brew
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
more
than
one
at
a
time
though
one
is
probably
enough
for
now
verdict
a
very
intense
beer
from
sixpoint
and
possibly
too
much
for
me
this
is
really
a
palate
killer
when
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
id
hoped
for
a
soft
sweet
silky
beer
that
highlights
the
adjuncts
but
got
something
that
was
punishing
and
brutal
o
i
think
this
could
have
kicked
ass
if
it
were
say
8
and
just
a
touch
sweeter
not
cloying
though
as
it
stands
it
feels
too
much
like
hard
work
drinking
it
not
bad
at
all
though
certainly
a
unique
take
on
a
coffee
and
chocolate
brew
this
doesnt
fall
into
the
traditional
baltic
porter
category
for
me
the
chocolate
and
coffee
jump
into
things
and
mesh
with
the
typical
characteristics
in
a
pretty
good
fashion
it
all
seems
to
fight
for
dominance
though
never
wins
feel
is
good
drinkability
is
good
i
can
dig
it
edit
092013
had
it
again
and
found
the
coffee
to
be
much
better
resulting
in
a
better
beer
overall
updating
scores
to
reflect
o
a
superb
brew
i
went
into
this
not
expecting
a
ton
but
hoping
to
really
like
it
i
was
supremely
impressed
o
very
nice
tasty
brew
the
abv
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
it
has
a
nice
complex
taste
and
warms
nicely
definitely
a
sipper
baltic
porteri
dont
know
o
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
month
interesting
concept
better
reality
3beans
is
an
enjoyable
mix
of
flavors
blended
well
to
avoid
sweetness
but
smooth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
worth
the
wait
o
this
one
really
surprised
me
after
the
smell
i
was
expecting
much
but
this
one
is
actually
pretty
damn
good
all
the
flavors
of
this
one
are
very
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
thanks
again
jageraholic
for
sending
this
can
my
way
o
i
enjoyed
the
sweetness
in
this
and
it
really
suprised
me
in
terms
of
your
normal
coffee
beer
varieties
the
10
abv
is
detected
though
with
a
lot
of
heat
on
the
way
down
i
suppose
the
ingredients
used
contributed
to
high
sugarhigh
abv
glad
to
have
tried
this
limited
release
serving
type
can
very
interesting
beer
good
coffee
and
chocolate
meld
not
overpowering
the
beer
pours
almost
black
with
over
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
the
head
fades
to
a
layer
on
top
of
the
pour
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
roasty
with
a
strong
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
presence
the
taste
isnt
very
sweet
at
all
and
there
is
hardly
a
trace
of
alcohol
lots
of
roasted
malts
along
with
the
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
the
finish
has
a
roasty
bitterness
to
it
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
never
would
have
guessed
the
abv
id
definitely
have
more
its
pretty
decent
overall
just
not
incredible
im
not
really
sure
what
to
call
it
ba
labels
it
as
a
baltic
porter
which
is
probably
close
but
not
quite
right
ive
see
it
also
called
an
imperial
stout
not
even
close
or
a
generic
coffee
stout
lacks
some
of
the
coffee
punch
for
me
so
it
is
a
solid
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
with
some
good
but
not
overly
potent
flavors
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
some
day
to
see
if
i
feel
differently
interestingly
i
often
feel
this
way
about
sixpoints
cans
that
they
lack
the
flavor
punch
that
i
am
hoping
them
to
have
except
for
resin
d
a
good
porter
definitely
a
sipper
i
appreciate
the
smaller
format
i
wish
id
see
in
more
high
abv
beers
id
try
it
again
preferably
on
draught
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
im
probably
gonna
hold
on
to
the
rest
of
the
4pack
for
a
while
hoping
that
some
age
will
mellow
out
the
alcohol
flavor
o
ive
had
a
couple
of
these
and
while
i
think
it
is
a
personal
thing
i
am
thrown
off
by
what
i
feeling
is
a
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
in
this
beer
something
intrigues
me
though
as
i
keep
coming
back
to
try
and
figure
it
out
always
enjoy
what
i
get
from
sixpoint
and
will
probably
end
up
buying
4
more
of
these
at
some
point
o
for
coffee
beer
fans
this
one
is
a
standout
stout
robust
and
wake
up
yummy
this
was
my
first
time
finally
trying
a
six
point
brew
cant
wait
to
try
more
varieties
o
cery
good
over
all
it
would
be
tough
to
say
that
the
the
alcohol
on
the
taste
would
go
away
with
some
aging
however
the
coffee
and
coco
flavor
would
desipate
after
a
short
time

the

is

remarkable
beer
cheers
the
earthy

undeniable

balances
the

theres

plenty
of

for
its
heft
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
drank
it
close

temperature
and
it
tasted
the
best
of
the
4
pack
i
bought
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
maroonishred
that
verged
on
black
but
not
quite
a
bit
of
translucency
was
evident
tons
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
to
a
nice
solid
2
finger
thick
head
head
was
rich
and
thick
with
a
fair
it
of

cling
aroma
was
a
slightly
sweet
chocolate
smell
with
a
very
small
hint
of
acidic
in
the
backend
taste
had
both
coffee
and
chocolate
without
either
overpowering
the
other
or
being
the
main
focal
point
the
coffee
notes
kicked
in
first
with
just
a
tab
of
bitterness
but
then
mellowed
out
and
left
a
nice
sweet
cocoa
flavor
on
the
tongue
coated
the
mouth
extremely
well
not
overly
bubbly
with
a
bit
of
chew
overall
a
very
solid
beer
perhaps
a
bit
expensive
3
75
for
the
single
can
but
a
very
solid
beer
right
up
my
alley
m
full
bodied
some
creaminess
overall
this
brew
is
simply
amazing
i
must
have
got
a
very
fresh
batch
since
the
characteristics
seemed
to
point
to
that
each
sip
impressed
me
all
over
again
throughout
light
to
medium
body
decent
carbonation
o
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
and
it
score
very
low
unanimously
across
the
board
at
a
recent
coffee
beer
tasting
o
this
is
a
great
onceinawhile
beer
which
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
complexity
of
character
to
boot
im
usually
not
one
for
flavored
beer
or
even
beer
brewed
with
flavoring
agents
other
than
hops
but
this
one
really
does
it
right
a
trip
to
the
jungle
of
flavor
in
your
mouth
tasty
enjoyable
grab
while
you
can
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
not
as
epic
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
a
good
effort
good
mouthfeel
and
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
o
this
beer
is
okay
i
enjoy
coffee
beers
i
love
porters
and
stouts
but
this
beer
just
did
not
come
together
for
me
thats
not
to
say
that
its
not
a
good
beer
but
just
not
to
me
overall
the
most
enjoyable
things
about
this
beer
was
the
flavoring
and
the
silky
soft
feel
the
three
beans
were
actually
all
apparent
at
one
point
or
another
each
adding
depth
and
complexity
the
malts
through
the
backbone
were
strong
roasty
charred
smoky
and
above
all
flavorful
this
coupled
with
the
soft
frothy
feel
made
for
a
wildly
drinkable
delicious
brew
not
a
bad
beer
i
certainly
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
the
four
pack
but
im
not
really
sure
if
id
buy
another
had
the
body
been
a
little
bigger
thicker
and
the
flavors
been
bigger
more
complex
i
think
this
really
wouldve
been
an
amazing
beer
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
bad
beer
much
to
sweet
for
my
preference
though
mdo
wheres
the
10
sixpoint
does
a
fine
job
of
maksing
a
double
digit
abv
behind
some
solid
albeit
not
terribly
earth
shattering
flavors
a
fine
porter
with
great
flavors
it
deserves
a
place
among
a
porter
lineup
but
it
doesnt
redefine
the
style
i
guess
i
am
trying
to
say
this
is
a
good
beer
and
sixpoint
continues
to
impress
and
that
the
good
people
over
at
sixpoint
should
send
a
pint
glass
in
my
direction
ooops
was
that
out
loud
the
beer
has
a
brown
cola
body
with
a
thick
creamy
beige
head
ample
lacing
coats
the
glass
the
aroma
is
coffee
beans
all
the
way
the
flavor
is
big
time
coffe
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
roast
medium
bodied
and
creamy
on
the
palate
alcohol
content
hidden
beautifully
perhaps
this
beer
is
one
dimensional
but
if
you
enjoy
a
big
rich
coffee
stout
you
should
seek
this
out
yum
overall
a
great
baltic
porter
and
a
really
interesting
concept
a
lot
of
bitter
chocolate
and
espresso
yes
quite
bitter
a
nice
roasty
sipper
the
10
abv
is
not
detected
pours
pretty
much
black
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
brown
and
ruby
red
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
finger
length
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
a
thick
lacing
around
the
edges
smells
of
mostly
coffee
beans
as
well
as
some
vanillacarmel
bakers
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malt
taste
starts
with
intense
roasted
coffee
beans
much
stronger
taste
than
the
aroma
suggests
almost
imparts
an
earthy
flavor
from
the
coffee
beans
then
smooths
out
in
the
middle
get
some
vanilla
or
carmel
that
acts
like
a
coffee
creamer
and
lightens
the
intensity
of
the
coffee
then
the
finish
brings
back
some
intense
coffee
flavors
in
addition
to
some
carmel
some
bittersweet
chocolate
as
well
as
some
bitterness
from
the
fairly
heavy
hop
presence
sweetness
increases
as
the
flavor
profile
moves
on
pretty
full
body
with
a
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
lively
carbonation
that
reminds
you
that
this
is
an
imperial
porter
not
an
imperial
stout
and
makes
the
beer
much
more
refreshing
for
a
fullbodied
beer
no
alcohol
detected
in
the
smell
or
taste
good
stuff
o
a
very
excellent
beer
but
i
cant
say
id
grab
another
four
pack
when
founders
fbs
is
sitting
right
next
to
it
at
3
cheaper
o
disappointing
and
borderline
unpleasant
and
thats
from
a
guy
with
a
refrigerator
full
of
20
different
stoutsporters
at
any
given
time
in
the
twoword
descriptions
that
i
try
to
record
for
every
beer
so
i
can
best
remember
them
id
use
either
mocha
everclear
or
big
blech
missed
it
here
or
else
i
got
an
insanely
bad
batch
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
that
is
basically
black
there
is
a
big
foamy
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
light
along
with
the
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
chocolatey
with
a
bit
of
coffee
on
the
nose
as
well
it
also
smells
sweet
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
roasted
the
coffee
isnt
that
strong
there
is
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
light
carbonation
and
smooth
overall
its
not
all
that
impressive
im
surprised
the
rating
is
as
high
as
it
is
not
something
i
need
to
have
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
doesnt
blow
me
away
and
could
have
used
more
pronounced
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
this
beer
comes
by
way
of
the
legendary
woodychandler
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
coffee
chocolate
taste
is
strong
coffee
some
hints
of
chocolate
the
10
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
if
you
like
coffee
give
this
beer
a
shot
overall
there
are
a
lot
of
bold
flavors
that
compete
for
the
tastebuds
attention
and
to
my
palate
they
never
quite
form
a
harmonious
whole
i
was
expecting
a
coffee
stout
and
would
hardly
think
of
this
as
a
baltic
porter
but
it
is
really
one
of
those
style
benders
others
obviously
like
it
but
this
one
just
has
too
many
clashing
flavors
for
me

flavors
o
3beans
may
not
be
just
what
i
want
from
a
coffee
beer
but
the
flavors
it
encompasses
vary
so
much
that
it
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
at
every
sip
really
i
dont
think
anyone
expected
that
pairing
oreos
with
a
stone
ipa
would
be
a
satisfying
experience
but
somehow
in
this
instance
it
clicked
ill
certainly
be
heading
back
to
the
bottle
shop
for
more
o
an
interesting
beer
from
sixpoint
thats
very
unique
compared
to
all
the
other
porters
out
there
definitely
worth
a
try
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
ive
heard
the
price
for
this
is
around
13
for
a
four
pack
of
cans
a
little
on
the
high
side
but
its
not
too
bad
this
is
a
good
beer
for
those
who
like
coffee
and
roasted
malty
beers
that
have
undeniable
hop
presence
the
crack
revealed
another
brimful
can
and
an
inverted
glug
was
deemed
to
be
in
order
proceeding
in
a
manner
completely
counterindicated
by
the
owners
manual
i
soon
had
what
resembled
an
ice
cream
sunday
in
my
glass
two
dense
unmoving
fingers
of
deeptan
head
sat
atop
a
bed
of
deep
dark
liquid
more
precisely
a
deep
darkbrown
liquid
that
stingily
would
not
allow
any
light
to
penetrate
its
depths
the
nose
smelled
like
the
moment
this
afternoon
that
we
walked
past
a
a
coffee
roasters
shop
this
afternoon
in
fells
point
you
have
to
be
a
coffee
drinker
to
appreciate
the
pavlovs
doglike
response
that
the
smell
of
coffee
elicits
in
a
coffee
drinker
and
ever
since
bmcs
sw
gerard
wargo
got
me
drinking
black
coffee
in
the
deck
department
office
of
the
uss
fulton
as11
in
1984
i
have
been
hooked
now
as
the
head
fell
i
began
to
foam
at
the
mouth
like
a
rabid
dog
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
like
a
mouthful
of
pudding
and
the
roastiness
of
the
coffee
hit
first
followed
by
a
chocolatiness
and
finally
a
smooth
vanilla
flavor
the
finish
lingered
with
a
coffee
roastiness
along
with
a
bitterness
of
dark
chocolate
this
would
have
been
great
to
share
with
the
old
lady
on
valentines
day
but
i
am
keeping
this
one
to
myself
o
really
misses
a
lot
of
what
should
make
it
good
very
bitter
and
yet
somehow
backed
up
by
nutrasweet
ill
age
the
other
can
in
hopes
this
mellows
out
or
in
case
i
got
a
bad
one
because
this
never
comes
together
d
a
pretty
solid
coffee
brew
certainly
at
the
forefront
of
flavor
and
aroma
refreshing
and
fresh
tasting
enjoyable
coffee
brew
especially
for
coffee
lovers
pick
one
up
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
dark
morning
beverage
o
great
baltic
porter
all
around
well
balanced
and
delcious
as
much
as
i
liked
it
i
think
im
still
partial
to
the
imperialdouble
stout
style
a
la
narwhal
overall
the
beer
was
better
as
it
warmed
up
complex
flavor
but
mostly
coffee
and
alcohol
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
a
prominent
chocolate
flavor
and
a
bigger
body
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
all
in
all
a
good
beer
overall
a
real
tasty
new
brew
from
sixpoint
liking
it
better
this
second
time
maybe
my
i
expected
too
much
going
into
it
the
first
time
a
little
pricey
but
worth
a
try
overall
the
brew
is
good
but
not
4
good
should
have
been
10
12
for
a
4pack
packs
the
punch
excellent
beer
to
open
on
a
weekend
morning
and
to
drink
in
lieu
of
coffee
pretty
good
but
also
pretty
lame
othis
is
just
a
great
beer
baltic
porter
maybe
not
tastes
more
like
a
strong
english
stout
there
is
hardly
any
abv
in
the
taste
its
so
smooth
i
bought
this
not
understanding
what
it
was
thinking
maybe
it
was
an
average
brown
ale
but
i
was
completely
surprised
and
satisfied
with
this
beer
i
suggest
your
try
this
if
you
see
this
o
this
is
a
great
beer
a
unique
and
well
made
beer
thats
sure
to
please
stout
lovers
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
pour
house
in
westmont
nj
in
retrospect
i
should
have
started
with
it
instead
of
finishing
it
has
an
extremely
heavy
flavor
and
feel
coupled
with
the
higher
alcohol
content
it
was
probably
poor
timing
for
me
it
tastes
very
good
and
i
would
have
given
it
a
better
rating
but
i
guess
it
was
just
too
much
for
me
at
the
time
served
in
a
leffe
chalice

overall
too
bad
its
a
oneoff
deep
brown
with
a
glint
of
ruby
thin
but
creamy
head
unfortunately
that
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
i
find
the
nose
to
have
almost
an
artificial
coffee
smell
im
sure
they
used
proper
coffee
though
to
me
it
smells
young
and
undeveloped
with
very
little
roast
character
or
astrigency
there
are
notes
of
toffee
hard
candy
and
faintly
talcum
powder
and
fusels
the
beer
is
far
too
watery
for
my
liking
and
a
little
too
lively
on
the
carbonation
the
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
are
there
but
the
fall
off
the
tongue
too
quickly
there
is
a
little
more
astringency
to
the
coffe
than
i
had
anticipated
which
i
like
but
this
beer
finishes
too
soon
not
much
hopping
comes
through
and
the
finish
is
a
tad
cloying
not
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
for
a
10
coffee
chocolate
beer
also
not
sure
what
the
romano
bean
is
doing
it
just
says
adds
complexity
in
the
box
so
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
dark
khaki
head
that
is
quite
impressive
garnet
highlights
when
held
up
decent
lacing
here
and
there
a
bouquet
of
coffee
and
roasted
grains
greet
my
waiting
nose
with
healthy
chocolate
notes
layered
in
the
sweetness
of
light
alcohol
mild
cherries
and
burnt
molasses
a
hint
of
the
oak
gives
faint
vanilla
taste
is
all
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
and
more
a
double
espresso
with
a
mochachino
chaser
the
oak
tinged
cherry
and
vanilla
flexing
nicely
some
burnt
sugary
sweetness
that
flows
into
a
healthy
charcoal
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
feel
is
sublime
with
a
rich
full
velvety
creaminess
carbonation
is
just
the
right
proportion
to
keep
it
highly
drinkable
a
great
winter
beer
that
i
would
love
any
time
of
the
year
overall
a
good
beer
but
room
from
improvement
overall
solid
beer
from
sixpoint
doesnt
really
hit
the
spot
for
people
who
want
a
strong
coffee
beer
balance
in
coffee
porters
but
luckily
im
not
one
of
those
people
not
necessarily
a
home
run
but
theres
many
elements
that
are
superbly
done
and
the
overall
experience
is
satisfying
pours
a
nice
reddish
tinted
dark
brown
fluffy
tannish
tinted
head
smell
of
bitter
roast
and
ground
cocoa
bean
and
espresso
bean
light
nuttyness
mild
sweetness
and
some
berry
notes
taste
dials
down
the
scent
a
bit
notes
of
dry
bitter
heavy
roasted
coffee
and
cocoa
mild
berry
notes
earthy
and
grainy
dry
oak
some
vanilla
minimal
sweetness
fuller
side
of
medium
dry
and
lingering
fruitiness
solid
selection
smoother
cocoa
and
coffee
notes
preferred
but
makes
this
interesting
overall
this
is
quite
good
its
atypical
of
the
style
but
quite
interesting
with
the
possible
exception
of
resin
this
is
the
best
canned
sixpoint
ive
had
overall
not
likely
one
i
would
go
too
again
a
little
too
bitter
and
astringent
at
the
end
with
the
taste
and
the
feel
a
bit
off
for
me
ok
but
for
the
cost
not
really
worth
it
poured
from
a
can
into
a
snifter
the
beer
appears
thin
on
the
pour
with
a
chestnut
highlighted
dark
brown
coloring
and
a
clingy
frothy
offwhite
head
that
starts
around
an
inch
and
slowly
settles
into
a
filmy
coating
aromas
of
creamy
smooth
blended
and
balanced
vanilla
and
chocolate
with
an
undertone
of
bitterness
from
both
chocolate
and
coffee
very
well
blended
and
complimentary
aromas
as
you
consume
flavors
of
rich
dark
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
cocoa
nibs
right
off
the
bat
wow
this
is
damn
tasty
creamy
backbone
of
vanilla
and
oak
support
the
rich
and
bitter
forefront
attack
on
your
tastebuds
and
there
is
a
strong
solid
boozey
tailend
flavor
that
bleeds
into
the
aftertaste
some
earthy
and
woody
highlights
help
to
add
depth
to
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
creamy
and
slightly
boozey
aftertaste
with
a
lingering
mocha
charateristic
the
lighter
body
lends
itself
to
a
clean
slightly
dry
finish
great
beer
well
crafted
and
very
well
balanced
bravo
overall
4
0
this
beer
is
unique
id
say
it
offers
a
very
interesting
balance
between
coffee
chocolate
but
chocolate
in
a
way
that
feels
different
malt
and
some
other
aspects
as
well
the
alcohol
is
noticeably
present
but
suitable
and
welcome
for
the
size
and
character
of
the
beer
but
whats
really
great
is
that
this
beer
really
opens
up
into
something
different
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
as
it
warms
flavors
rearrange
the
feel
transforms
and
it
just
becomes
something
different
and
definitely
tasty

medium
body
well
carbonated
chewy
and
sticky
on
the
palate
this
is
easily
one
of
the
better
canned
sixpoint
offerings
of
late
and
i
really
wouldnt
have
pegged
this
at
10
abv
o
not
a
disaster
but
it
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
i
wont
miss
it
when
its
gone
and
thats
coming
from
a
major
sixpoint
fan
overall
i
first
have
to
thank
mike
at
the
superstar
beverage
deer
park
ny
for
convincing
me
to
get
this
gem
this
beer
is
incredible
i
normally
resist
to
grab
porters
just
because
of
the
fact
i
prefer
stouts
but
this
one
is
a
strict
winwin
situation
it
costs
a
notch
more
than
most
sixpoint
beers
but
it
will
definitely
not
disappoint
salud
o
a
decent
beer
though
one
with
a
few
flaws
personally
i
find
it
to
be
more
of
a
flavored
brown
ale
than
a
baltic
porter
good
flavors
though
the
beer
seems
to
have
pulled
too
much
from
the
barrel
great
beer
with
real
depth
the
chocolate
kept
the
coffee
from
being
too
bitter
another
one
of
those
easydrinking
beers
that
you
need
to
be
careful
of
given
its
high
abv
o
considering
its
strength
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
except
for
some
hints
of
it
towards
the
finish
i
really
like
the
balance
between
the
coffee
and
chocolate
because
it
really
seems
to
provide
a
perfect
mix
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
snowy
night
here
in
the
northeast
just
finished
with
my
snowblower
and
thought
i
would
treat
myself
to
some
stouts
the
3bean
was
the
first
i
had
no
question
about
more
coffee
this
time
around
everything
was
almost
perfect
very
soft
and
big
in
my
mouth
hitting
every
sense
there
aftertaste
was
just
as
it
started

went

the
next

poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
dense
tan

which
lasted
through
the
drink
and
laced
greatly
appearance
was
a
ruby
brown
with
an
aroma
of
malt
grass

taste
was
intense
with
strong
notes
of

with

mouthfeel
was

glad
i
have
several
more
in
my

lighter
in

than
would

from
a
10
porter
very
bitter
with
a
slick
texture
this
beer
started
off
promising
but
tailed
off
drastically
towards
the
end
an
odd
brew
for
sure
but
kudos
for
originality
and
thinking
outside
the
box
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
strong
coffee
flavor
in
your
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
nice
experience
i
will
take
a
wild
guess
here
and
say
that
this
is
the
first
baltic
porter
ive
enjoyed
out
of
a
can
well
it
was
packaged
in
a
can
but
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
this
time
anyways
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
mostly
with
the
coffee
being
the
dominant
aroma
light
earth
ash
light
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
burro
load
of
juan
valdez
light
ethanol
flavor
and
a
touch
of
dark
pitted
fruit
flavor
add
a
hint
of
complexity
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
creamy
but
coarse
mouthfeel
and
a
light
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
porter
if
you
like
a
coffee
bomb
looked
at
the
reviews
expecting
to
see
this
in
the
high
70s
was
shocked
to
see
the
reviews
so
positive
honestly
thought
this
was
a
mess
overall
pretty
nice
i
wish
the
coffee
was
a
bit
stronger
as
it
advertises
a
lot
but
the
malt
profile
is
quite
nice
and
coffee
eventually
comes
out
nicely
the
hops
are
an
interesting
surprise
but
maybe
a
bit
too
much
the
booze
is
ok
but
maybe
a
little
too
much
as
well
really
just
wish
the
coffee
was
a
bit
more
o
very
good
and
enjoyable
this
is
full
bodied
with
sharp
carbonation
i
would
like
this
a
lot
if
i
hadnt
had
so
many
better
examples
of
coffee
beers
as
it
stands
the
taste
here
is
middling
12oz
can
served
in
my
weyerbacher
tulip
pours
a
deep
brown
with
dark
ruby
highlights
around
the
base
when
the
light
hit
the
glass
just
right
head
is
half
an
inch
and
tancolored
and
leaves
a
residual
band
of
lacing
as
it
slowly
recedes
nose
expresses
cocoa
dark
fruit
and
roasted
coffee
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
a
distinct
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
finish
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
a
hint
of
acidity
that
is
detectable
at
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
with
quite
a
few
different
levels
to
it
too
bad
its
a
oneoff
the
beer
pours
a
dull
hazy
dark
brown
with
an
inch
of
fluffy
tan
head
that
laces
it
presents
much
better
than
expected
with
such
a
large
abv
to
which
i
attribute
to
the
romano
beans
the
nose
has
potent
notes
of
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
its
both
bitter
and
sweet
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
cold
hot
chocolate
with
huge
amounts
of
chocolate
sweetness
upfront
that
transitions
to
a
hoppycoffee
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
but
drinks
like
most
coffee
porters
slightly
watery
but
lacking
the
body
youd
expected
based
on
the
smell
and
taste
the
aftertaste
is
huge
gush
of
roasty
bitter
chocolate
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
was
surprisingly
flavorful
i
didnt
grab
much
of
the
fruitiness
i
expect
with
a
baltic
porter
but
it
certainly
packed
in
enough
flavor
the
bitterness
really
builds
with
this
guy
dominating
the
palate
in
a
good
way
this
is
a
mighty
fine
coffee
porter
o
this
heavyhitting
uberflavorful
baltic
porter
may
clock
in
at
10
abv
but
its
dangerously
drinkable
on
its
own
and
could
be
even
better
with
a
chocolate
or
berryaccented
dessert
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
limitedrun
dark
strong
specialty
brew
seek
it
out
giving
in
to
this
taste
would
be
detrimental
to
health
and
mind
as
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
deceptively
well
its
sultry
attitude
with
savory
hearty
sweetness
and
casual
effort
makes
it
somewhat
sessionable
a
horrible
blend
for
those
lushlikeme
types
overall
i
dont
find
much
baltic
sense
about
this
not
getting
that
banana
feeling
but
in
terms
of
what
this
is
its
pretty
darn
fun
and
certainly
a
great
take
for
a
style
i
am
a
little
averse
to
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
the
labeldescription
reads
like
a
hell
of
a
good
idea
and
has
potential
but
it
just
didnt
totally
transcribe
well
in
the
glass
the
look
of
this
brew
is
damn
near
perfect
but
thats
where
the
best
attributes
end
the
smell
is
ok
and
the
taste
has
its
moments
of
brilliance
that
are
short
lived
i
purchased
a
4pack
of
this
and
drank
my
first
yesterday
and
was
let
down
thinking
my
senses
must
have
been
off
that
day
having
it
again
tonight
made
me
realize
this
just
isnt
that
good
of
a
brew
overall
a
solid
porter
especially
suited
for
cold
winter
nights
o
it
is
an
interesting
beer
and
solid
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
there
are
coffee
and
chocolate
elements
but
they
could
be
bigger
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
more
o
a
unique
and
special
baltic
porter
that
lived
up
to
the
style
but
also
had
an
enjoyable
twist
thrown
in
by
sixpoint
fantastic
big
beer
and
a
good
looking
can
d
a
very
nice
very
rewarding
brew
from
sixpoint
im
challenging
to
think
of
anything
that
quite
compares
as
this
one
is
rather
unique
i
can
recommend
with
a
clean
conscience
and
will
gladly
seek
out
and
enjoy
again
without
hesitation
d
a
very
good
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
10
dessert
like
but
without
the
dessert
sweetness
o
it
is
quite
flavorful
and
complex
for
a
coffee
porter
it
is
right
up
there
with
anything
ive
had
o
its
a
solid
beer
to
someone
who
isnt
as
sensitive
to
boozy
beers
itd
probably
be
quite
good
if
you
dont
like
a
full
bodied
beer
i
find
the
odd
flavor
i
get
in
the
middle
of
each
sip
somewhat
off
putting
not
really
sure
what
that
is
overall
i
think
its
balanced
nicely
and
gives
you
the
desired
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
after
having
resin
and
whatnot
i
wasnt
going
to
give
sixpoint
a
second
look
but
this
beer
is
probably
the
best
theyve
brewed
so
far
id
at
least
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
overall
this
is
incredible
might
surpass
breakfast
stout
in
the
realm
of
coffee
beers
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
puffy
but
bubbly
head
not
unlike
cocacola
the
head
rapidly
dissipates
to
less
than
a
half
inch
in
height
nevertheless
the
lacing
is
fantastic
sticking
heavily
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
beer
goes
down
the
aroma
is
very
intriguing
at
first
there
is
an
almost
maple
or
molasses
scent
but
then
the
milk
chocolate
and
boozy
bourbon
kicks
right
in
a
vanilla
bean
sweetness
is
faintly
detectable
in
the
background
for
the
taste
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
who
find
this
to
be
coffeeforward
the
dark
chocolate
aspect
competes
however
wrapped
in
a
more
subtle
smokiness
and
a
splash
of
bourbon
the
finish
is
a
bit
woody
and
dry
and
has
a
medium
mouth
feel
very
warming
on
its
way
down
but
stops
just
short
of
having
too
much
alcohol
heat
overall
an
interesting
beer
definitely
worth
trying
its
different
but
could
be
more
balanced
o
the
alcohol
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
in
this
beer
and
i
love
the
packaging
form
factor
the
12
oz
red
bull
style
can
is
just
awesome
glad
that
i
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
as
it
is
a
one
time
brew
and
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
sixpoint
collaborated
with
mast
bros
chocolate
and
stumptown
coffee
both
quality
local
artisans
i
found
the
beer
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
not
sure
this
is
a
typical
baltic
porter
but
definitely
a
nice
imperial
style
porter
d
given
the
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
a
bit
sweet
for
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
go
though
very
interesting
brew
need
to
drink
this
warmer
to
let
the
coffee
come
through
quite
earthy
good
fireside
brew
o
a
delightful
porter
deceptively
strong
definitely
rebuyable
i
think
this
beer
would
have
faired
much
better
without
the
oak
aging
the
coffee
had
so
much
potential
but
it
was
lost
to
the
wood
its
s
decent
beer
but
i
expected
more
o
overall
a
nice
beer
from
sixpoint
i
had
to
see
what
the
hub
bub
was
about
and
it
is
fairly
good
and
can
hang
with
many
big
coffee
beers
id
have
to
say
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
that
sixpoint
distributes
with
resin
and
now
3beans
sixpoint
has
stepped
up
their
game
a
bit
id
definitely
revisit
this
one
o
definitely
one
of
the
most
chocolate
and
coffee
forward
beers
ive
had
without
going
overboard
on
the
sweetness
yes
im
looking
at
you
st
mokah
disappointed
this
is
a
oneoff
although
i
can
see
why
it
is
with
the
actual
cacao
and
coffee
being
added
definitely
recommended
while
its
still
available
12
ounce
can
best
before
10jul2013
as
stamped
on
bottom
of
can
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
didnt
stick
around
for
long
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
it
smells
like
coffee
roasted
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
and
some
nuts
it
tastes
like
coffee
chocolate
milk
and
bittersweet
cream
nuts
roasted
malt
and
some
vanilla
its
a
little
more
bitter
and
roasty
than
sweet
tasting
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
although
id
like
it
better
if
it
was
in
16
ounce
cans
instead
8
99
a
4pack
overall
it
was
excellent
and
i
hope
this
is
a
regular
production
beer
from
sixpoint
a
very
high
recommendation
i
want
to
get
some
more
of
this
asap
not
many
people
get
excited
about
a
baltic
porter
in
general
but
this
is
one
baltic
porter
that
may
get
the
masses
raving
about
it
o
very
tasty
beer
and
very
sweet
so
much
chocolate
it
almost
doesnt
taste
like
beer
so
resin
was
my
favorite
sixpoint
beer
but
this
just
blew
it
out
of
the
water
i
have
never
tasted
such
a
damn
good
coffee
porter
make
that
coffee
beer
so
sweet
yet
so
roasty
so
damn
dangerously
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
a
baltic
porter
the
alcohol
bothered
me
but
i
wonder
if
one
could
age
a
beer
in
a
can
to
see
if
it
mellows
regardless
if
youre
looking
for
a
challenge
to
your
palate
check
this
out
not
bad
its
a
very
bold
baltic
porter
its
a
nice
coffee
beer
better
than
average
but
something
wasnt
hitting
for
me
final
judgement
im
glad
jack
didnt
plant
any
of
these
3
beans
because
wed
be
deprived
a
fine
brew
find
it
and
try
it
poured
can
into
great
lakes
snifter
pours
a
cola
color
with
clarity
on
the
pour
as
it
collects
in
the
glass
it
appears
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
decent
amount
of
lacing
present
on
the
pour
the
nose
starts
with
bold
and
bitter
cacao
nib
character
this
comes
off
a
bit
harsh
up
front
but
fades
into
a
more
decadent
coffee
aroma
the
nose
definitely
leans
towards
the
bitter
side
of
things
with
a
dash
of
earthy
huskiness
and
an
ever
so
faint
hop
presence
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
refined
than
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
the
cacao
again
is
present
first
followed
by
a
nice
bold
and
robust
coffee
character
leaves
more
of
an
espresso
quality
as
the
bold
roasted
beans
linger
through
the
palate
this
is
a
little
drier
than
most
coffee
chocolate
brews
i
have
encountered
and
at
first
left
a
little
to
be
desired
as
it
warms
and
develops
in
the
glass
i
rather
enjoy
the
bold
and
bitter
onslaught
of
coffee
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
lacking
in
my
opinion
it
is
simply
too
thin
to
hold
up
to
the
presence
of
adjunct
ingredients
overall
this
is
a
unique
offering
that
is
better
than
the
other
sixpoint
stuff
i
have
had
it
seems
to
grow
on
me
with
each
sip
worth
a
try
nothing
like
a
biblical
quote
taken
slightly
out
of
context
on
a
red
bullstyle
can
the
contents
pour
a
deep
dark
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
sturdy
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
coffee
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
light
cola
light
molasses
and
a
pinch
of
brown
sugar
and
clove
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
both
the
coffee
and
the
chocolate
coming
through
grainier
more
bitter
in
fact
nearly
all
of
the
sweetness
inherent
in
the
smell
has
been
drained
out
here
theres
also
a
vague
sense
of
spruce
or
something
similar
thereto
hanging
around
as
well
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slightly
creamy
feel
and
a
drying
finish
overall
an
interesting
concoction
one
that
seems
to
make
good
use
of
the
combination
of
beans

pretty
good
baltic

and
definitely
worth
buying
a
fourpack
at

the

i
am
at
odds
this
is
so
close
to
being
a
home
run
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
really
kill
it
for
me
if
this
was
a
bit
creamier
or
smoother
in
some
manner
it
would
rock
that
said
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
worth
your
while
seeking
out
to
try
t
definitely
makes
a
statement
like
it
or
not
poured
pitch
black
from
the
can
with
thick
lacing
down
my
mug
the
aroma
is
thick
with
the
stumptown
coffee
while
tangy
bitter
cocoa
pulls
through
stronger
in
the
flavor
the
flavor
tend
to
trade
back
and
forth
in
the
beers
character
over
the
blackroasted
barley
the
dark
flavors
blend
and
run
into
a
long
lingering
aftertaste
its
slightly
dry
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
10
dark
beer
but
i
suppose
baltic
porters
go
down
more
easily
than
an
imperial
stouts
12oz
can
with
a
best
before
date
of
10
july
2013
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
a
nice
taste
of
mocha
with
some
warming
alcohol
and
roasted
malts
some
earth
along
with
some
sweetness
not
getting
as
much
vanilla
as
in
the
nose
bit
of
a
caramel
and
mocha
finish
lots
of
carbonation
overall
a
nice
mix
of
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
that
works
well
worth
grabbing
again
as
it
warms
the
coffee
aroma
becomes
more
pronounced
the
chocolate
taste
by
the
way
is
nicely
balanced
way
below
most
of
the
rest
of
the
flavors
this
may
be
the
best
coffee
flavored
brew
i
have
ever
had
hurray
for
sixpoint
o
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
it
feels
very
disjointed
and
doesnt
mesh
well
at
all
coffee
has
a
strong
presence
on
the
nose
but
gets
a
bit
lost
in
the
taste
its
too
boozy
and
the
oak
is
a
slight
distraction
to
me
the
base
beer
comes
across
as
a
brown
alebrown
porter
though
it
tastes
rather
clean
and
the
body
just
cant
support
all
the
adjuncts
at
work
never
mind
the
oak
and
the
10
abv
my
least
favorite
sixpoint
beer
odi
have
been
and
will
be
a
sucker
for
sixpoint
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
them
if
not
my
favorite
its
big
and
unwavering
if
you
have
any
interest
in
coffee
andor
chocolate
get
this
i
wish
my
coffee
tasted
like
this
each
morningi
also
wish
my
coffee
made
me
feel
like
this
in
the
morning
too
also
this
is
the
best
looking
can
i
have
ever
seen
o
fanstinkingtastic
ill
be
seeking
more
of
this
asap
sixpoint
youve
done
it
again
taste
is
again
fresh
coffee
a
bit
of
vanilla
oak
and
a
tad
of
chocolate
super
super
smooth
such
an
awesome
porter
its
basically
like
the
gorilla
warfare
porter
on
steroids
which
is
a
good
thing
have
one
now
o
as
per
usual
with
sixpoint
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
about
this
beer
makes
it
stand
out
and
yell
hey
im
friggin
epic
drink
me
nowww
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
all
of
their
yearround
offerings
but
none
of
their
seasonal
brews
have
stood
out
above
the
rest
to
me
however
the
idea
of
brewing
beans
into
a
beer
to
boost
protein
content
and
add
naturallyoccurring
sugars
is
something
i
find
intriguing
and
will
test
myself
sometime
in
the
near
future
also
if
you
are
a
homebrew
nut
and
are
feeling
adventurous
let
me
know
i
just
brewed
a
batch
of
root
beer
stout
that
will
finish
in
march
and
would
be
glad
to
share
the
recipe
all
that
said
have
a
good
good
roasted
malts
up
front
along
with
dark
chocolate
bitterness
dark
fruit
and
rum
sweetness
fills
in
the
palate
notes
of
carob
and
molasses
roasted
coffee
picks
up
and

the

more

notes
make
for

overall
i
think
this
pretty
good
and
flavors
balance
well
i
wish
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
were
more
prominent
but
this
was
definatly
a
good
pick
up
o
this
is
good
stuff
toes
the
line
between
roasty
and
chocolatey
with
roasty
and
roasted
coffee
prevailing
early
but
chocolate
stepping
up
as
it
warms
up
a
little
plus
it
packs
a
nice
buzz
o
very
underwhelmed
with
this
one
i
had
high
hopes
and
i
was
disappointed
to
be
fair
im
probably
a
little
more
critical
of
coffee
brews
but
this
is
one
of
the
only
times
ive
sipped
a
sixpoint
brew
and
wasnt
overly
impressed
o
this
beer
didnt
impress
me
as
much
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
but
for
the
price
its
extremely
hard
to
beat
it
was
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
and
slightly
on
the
thin
side
the
coffee
and
chocolate
wasnt
as
robust
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
that
being
said
for
2
50can
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
for
its
price
range
id
recommend
trying
it
out
o
a
very
easy
drinking
baltic
porter
the
10
is
hidden
well
almost
too
wellas
i
finish
the
glass
and
the
beer
approaches
room
temp
it
starts
to
resemble
stale
sweet
root
beer
ill
revisit
but
not
the
most
pleasant
finish

slight
coffee
quality
and
a
hint
of
that
cacao
aromas
of
oak
no
i
am
pleased
with
the
flavor
more
so
then
the
aroma
a
complex
blend
of
coffee
cacao
and
roasted
barley
the
coffee
flavour
is
round
soft
and
apparent
the
cacaochocolate
is
subtle
but
present
the
roast
marrys
well
without
being
acrid
i
detect
no
oak
if
this
is
in
fact
a
baltic
porter
it
makes
sense
there
is
a
cleanness
to
this
beer
obtainable
only
through
lagering
for
a
ten
percent
beer
the
alcohol
does
not
get
anywhere
near
detectable
the
beer
is
clean
on
the
palate
not
cloying
slightly
roasty
and
pleasant
this
is
one
of
the
finest
offering
from
sixpoint
i
have
yet
had
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
flavorful
but
in
the
end
complexity
is
somewhat
lacking
very
very
good
i
will
be
buying
this
again
overall
a
great
well
balanced
and
delicious
baltic
porter
from
sixpoint
glad
to
see
them
offer
this
kind
of
style
cause
lets
face
it
you
dont
see
it
all
too
often
is
this

it

merely
unexpected
and
once
i
adjusted
to
the
more

than
anticipated
i
was
able
to
enjoy
it
not
surprising
given
it
is

herringbone

the

a
dark
pleasure
o
a
nice
true
to
style
old
school
baltic
porter
one
of
the
style
benchmarks
happily
no
significant
oxidation
have
had
this
many
times
but
this
time
worthy
writing
about
beer
was
a
soft
wash
of
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
excellent
mouth
feel
which
is
delightful
considering
the
rather
low
abv
my
61
yo
old
nose
doesnt
pick
up
much
these
days
but
there
is
still
a
nice
roasted
grain
scent
and
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
this
is
just
a
great
porter
may
possibly
be
my
favorite
ever
as
a
lover
of
porter
no
small
praise
this
one
was
impressive
because
it
lasted
so
long
and
remained
drinkable
it
also
helps
that
it
tasted
pretty
good
o
the
smells
from
this
beer
are
robust
and
while
the
beer
is
more
restrained
when
it
hits
the
palate
the
overall
result
is
a
topnotch
porter
othis
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
aroma
in
particular
just
keeps
revealing
new
flavors
with
each
sniff
and
each
new
flavor
just
seems
to
fold
into
the
rest
in
a
really
pleasing
package
the
taste
is
a
bit
simpler
and
the
mouth
is
a
touch
lighter
than
i
would
like
but
i
would
happily
drink
more
of
this

this

is
hard
to
rate
in
comparison
with
other
baltics
it
seems
to
be
more
in
the
vein
of
a
classic
baltic
while
most
contemporary
beers
of
the
style
are
heavier
in

roasted

ill
just
say
that

likely

those
most
afraid
of
them
i
should
have
expected
such
a
watereddown
product
from
carlsberg
theres
nothing
bold
or
intimating
about
this
supposed
baltic
porter
its
as
much
a
caricature
as
the
swedish
chef
from
the
muppets
scandinavians
do
much
bolder
and
better
than
this
dont
waste
your
time
on
it
dark
and

with
plenty
taste
o
roasted
and
bitter
with
out
backbone
this
light
in
every
sense
of
the
word
baltic
porter
has
flimsy
lopsided
flavor
and
the
makings
of
a
nice
baltic
but
little
body
to
back
it
up
i
went
into
my
local
wellstocked
beer
store
and
cruised
for
eyecandy
as
neither
my
memory
nor
my
heart
could
come
up
with
an
otherwise
specific
reference
i
saw
the
label
the
color
the
unique
bottle
shape
and
i
was
at
the
register
faster
than
i
could
change
my
mind
i
came
home
started
heating
up
the
kitchen
cooking
and
anticipating
what
my
mind
was
computing
my
hearts
eyes
whim
came
up
with
at
the
beer
shop
and
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
popped
my
stellar
bottled
firmament
anxiously
pouring
it
into
a
handy
pint
glass
to
find
a
most
satisfying
cooking
companion
to
prepare
my
palate
for
the
delicious
spicy
peppers
and
pasta
meal
i
was
preparing
round
brown
sweet
and
smooth
a
lucky
privileged
guy
am
i
some
of
the
elements
i
find
in
this
drink
i
also
look
for
in
my
morning
espresso
my
other
main
hobby
this
is
now
a
permanent
inclusion
to
my
short
goto
list
awesome
everytime
brew
overall
im
glad
this
was
recommended
to
me
its
a
fairly
robust
porter
with
good
depth
of
flavor
and
supreme
drinkability
definitely
a
nice
change
from
the
typical
american
style
porters
that
are
so
common
highly
recommended

from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
pours
pitch
black
with
a
foamy

smells
of
chocolate
a
little
coffee
tastes
of
raisins
fruit
and
candy
quite
surprising
beer
lightly
carbonated
full
body
nice
finish
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
looks
stout
but
has
a
thinner
lighter
feel
though
it
seems
too
rich
and
smooth
to
be
a
porter
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
just
want
one
quick
brew
with
not
too
much
alcohol
and
a
big
interesting
taste
sit
on
the
back
porch
like
i
am
now
and
enjoy
your
brew
what
a
beautiful
baltic
porter
if
you
like
dark
beers
it
is
a
must
o
a
historic
brew
one
of
the
first
original
style
porters
ive
had
and
one
that
will
always
be
near
and
dear
to
me
this
is
the
brew
you
should
introduce
yourself
with
when
trying
a
porter
for
the
first
time
o
lowish
carbonation
aside
this
has
aged
like
a
champ
a
shame
ill
likely
never
be
able
to
find
this
again
barring
a
trade
because
this
is
really
excellent
stuff
and
hey
i
didnt
have
to
drink
a
crappy
carlsberg
lager
or
sell
my
soul
for
a
bottle
of
kaggen
stormakstporter
just
so
i
could
tick
a
swedish
brew

brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
generous
foamy
tan
head
that
crowns
the
beer
very
subtle
nose
nothings
jumping
right
out
hints
of
caramel
roast
and
chocolate
with
even
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
but
its
all
very
much
in
balance
mild
coffee
and
hint
of
burgundy
wine
even
a
bit
tannic
mouthfeel
but
only
serves
to
balance
the
malt
sweetness
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
2000
vintage
bottle
of
this
for
just
13
bucks
the
label
reads
best
before
november
2010
but
im
thinking
its
not
past
its
prime
at
all
it
pours
a
surprisingly
lively
darkest
of
browns
without
any
light
at
all
able
to
pass
through
the
head
is
made
up
of
micro
bubbles
of
a
lighter
brown
color
the
head
doesnt
last
but
its
easily
reinvigorated
with
a
swirl
of
my
globe
the
nose
on
this
is
heavy
chocolate
burnt
malt
ash
and
a
gentle
toffee
tickle
it
has
an
aged
mellowness
to
it
very
earthy
and
organic
with
roasted
barley
and
cocoa
powder
dominating
up
front
the
finish
is
like
all
the
best
features
of
dusty
leather
my
grandpas
attic
mature
compost
and
smoked
pork
its
just
so
complex
and
delicious
there
is
a
funny
astringent
bitterness
towards
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
stands
out
more
than
it
should
in
a
beer
so
low
in
abv
but
other
than
that
its
phenomenal
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
for
me
so
gentle
on
the
carbonation
and
curiously
dry
for
the
style
i
love
the
cocoa
powder
flavor
it
transforms
into
a
cocoa
powder
feel
of
sorts
really
cool
age
has
definitely
done
wonders
for
this
beer
and
while
ive
never
had
a
fresh
one
i
can
assure
you
that
this
is
one
special
porter
perhaps
also
my
first
beer
from
sweden
memorable
i
had
it
at
beer
table
on
tap
in
brooklyn
where
they
really
care
about
teh
suds
this
is
a
pretty
good
porter
overall
o
very
interesting
porter
here
all
the
sweetness
you
want
but
there
is
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
brings
everything
back
great
abv
that
makes
this
a
pretty
damn
good
session
beer
worth
looking
for
it
you
can
find
it
it
is
an
outstanding
balance
between
rich
full
character
complexity
and
easy
drinkability
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
will
buy
this
over
and
over
again
next
time
i
see
it
im
gonna
buy
a
few
to
drink
and
a
couple
to
store
i
have
one
ike
holding
for
a
year
but
i
have
a
feeling
two
or
three
or
more
years
will
make
this
beer
absolutely
fanfuckintastic
o
i
had
hoped
to
like
this
more
but
it
was
only
slightly
above
average
maybe
ill
give
it
a
chance
again
in
the
future
after
a
long
tough
day
it
could
be
my
palate
is
messed
up
others
seem
to
like
it
more
so
its
worth
a
try
not
bad
just
not
that
great
and
i
love

from

notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
red
tint
at
the
edges
with
a
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
light
chocolate
tasted
kind
of
understated
on
opening
with
dark
roasted
malt
and
dark
fruit
on
warming
a
bit
the
cherry
chocolate
vanilla
and
molasses
started
coming
out
great
flavoe
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
a
quite
nice
low
abv
porter
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
without
great
expectations
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
will
buy
again
the
pour
is
brown
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
some
roast
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
coffee
come
through
first
on
the
nose
a
bit
dusty
and
oxidized
quite
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
especially
prunes
the
flavor
is
fairly
simple
some
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
tons
of
dark
fruit
o
good
drinker
quite
satisfying
nice
beer
to
end
the
day
with
one
of
the
better
offering
of
this
style
this
beer
is
a
2004
vintage
it
pours
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
tints
to
it
i
can
smell
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
some
dark
fruit
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
but
also
smooth
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
is
low
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
id
definitely
drink
it
again
o
i
first
had
this
several
years
ago
and
was
blown
away
happy
to
say
that
this
is
still
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
porters
overall
not
bad
o
what
an
odd
beer
it
has
some
roasty
tobacco
malt
notes
but
it
also
has
a
surprisingly
bright
fruit
element
to
it
really
delicious
aged
beer
that
i
got
for
a
bargain
price
o
quite
nice
a
great
porter
pitch
black
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
that
reduces
to
a
creamy
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
some
sediment
left
in
the
bottle
interesting
aroma
along
with
a
fresh
chocolate
grain
richness
there
is
a
good
amount
of
toffee
nuts
prune
and
port
dark
malt
and
fruit
flavor
exhibiting
some
tartness
and
a
dry
roasty
edge
dark
fruit
berries
and
molasses
not
as
rich
as
many
baltic
porters
but
then
it
is
unusually
light
in
alcohol
medium
bodied
and
pretty
clean
but
seems
to
fall
a
little
flat
id
be
interested
to
see
what
this
would
be
like
properly
cellared
for
a
couple
more
years
a
fine
porter
this
was
such
a
surprise
id
seen
it
on
the
shelves
never
really
thought
much
of
it
til
now
really
glad
i
tried
it
given
the
restrained
alcohol
this
is
a
great
example
of
how
a
lot
of
flavor
can
be
crammed
into
a
fairly
tidy
package
there
are
just
so
many
emerging
layers
each
sip
is
kind
of
a
new
experience
i
also
love
how
it
straddles
the
line
btw
lager
ale
at
times
what
a
cool
brew
o
a
nice
beer
good
enough
to
try
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
milk
chocolate
2
finger
head
that
settles
into
a
nice
12
finger
head
the
aroma
is
nice
of
chocolate
sweet
brown
sugar
and
some
slight
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
grainy
strong
on
the
sweeter
malts
not
too
much
of
a
hop
presence
to
balance
things
a
little
roasted
malt
but
not
enough
dark
roast
flavor
medium
body
with
lighter
carbonation
a
decent
brew
but
not
a
top
tier
porter
very
dark
brown
average
and
mostly
diminishing
light
brown

moderate
malty
and
sweetish
aroma
fruitiness
dark

some

and
coffeelight
roasted

finish
is
average
malty
and
sweetish
coffee
and
some
roasted

light
fruitiness
and
hoppyness
overall
this
porter
was
a
bit
too
flattish
for
me
but
had
a
nice
vinous
fruitiness
to
it
not
super
impressed
with
this
beer
basically
a
notch
or
two
above
a
dark
euro
lager
definitely
not
a
baltic
porter
in
my
eyes
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
dark
fruit
dark
sugar
vanilla
and
some
earthy
tobaccolike
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
malt
dark
dried
fruit
pruneraisin
leather
smoke
tobacco
and
slight
cocoa
nibs
there
is
a
light
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
baltic
porter
and
a
rare
treat
that
is
around
8
years
old
i
am
glad
i
picked
one
of
these
up
to
try
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
brews
ive
ever
had
there
are
so
many
flavors
going
on
in
both
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
i
had
a
great
evening
listening
to
jaga
jazzist
live
at
the
cosmopolite
and
sipping
on
a
glass
of
this
stuff
its
not
too
often
that
i
say
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
a
brew
to
see
if
i
can
figure
it
out
more
but
this
is
one
of
those
wow
thats
a
great
beer
we
had
a
porter
stout
beer
tasting
over
new
years
eve
and
of
the
12
beers
we
tried
this
was
hands
down
1
some
of
the
beers
we
had
were
bitter
or
had
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
too
much
going
on
in
some
of
them
carnegie
porter
had
the
straightup
porter
style
that
i
look
for
full
flavored
smooth
with
a
short
creamy
head
world
class
this
is
the
first
beer
i
felt
compelled
to
review
overall
this
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
it
is
far
better
than
any
5
50
abv
attempt
at
a
blaltic
porter
in
fact
im
very
impressed
by
the
amount
of
aroma
and
flavor
are
in
a
beer
this
light
o
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
based
on
its
reviews
and
recommendations
its
pretty
solid
but
not
my
a
baltic
porter
id
drink
it
if
offered
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
o
really
nice
porter
for
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
it
did
quite
well
o
the
entire
experience
is
perfect
from
the
price
the
cool
bottle
to
the
pour
and
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
journey
but
subtle
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
im
not
eating
anything
but
i
can
pair
this
with
all
kinds
of
foods
some
grilled
lamb
with
asparagus
for
dessert
some
raisin
pudding
cake
maybe
a
vanilla
ice
cream
im
going
to
age
my
other
bottle
and
let
those
flavors
grow
i
was
pretty
close
to
giving
this
one
a
5
on
taste
too
alas
its
only
about
four
layers
of
flavor
deep
damn
this
is
a
great
porter
deep
rich
color
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
2010
vintage
baltic
baby
smell
is
super
complex
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
i
inhale
deeply
with
every
sip
lots
of
depth
on
the
tongue
malty
well
balanced
i
almost
should
change
that
to
a
5
on
taste
this
is
a
perfect
baltic
porter
mouthfeel
is
energetic
but
silky
highly
recommended
pours
the
darkest
of
brown
with
faint
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
a
good
sized
creamy
off
white
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
moderate
lace
in
its
wake
smells
of
caramelized
sugar
and
dark
pitted
fruit
mostly
but
has
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
on
the
outer
fringes
this
one
smells
like
a
fine
dopplebock
honestly
taste
is
moderately
fruity
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
ash
deep
burnt
sugars
mix
with
dark
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
it
really
straddles
the
line
between
porter
and
dopplebock
for
me
though
maybe
one
day
i
can
try
a
fresher
example
o
very
good
porter
easily
drinkable
charming
traditional
look
beer
label
as
baltic
porters
go
this
hardly
qualifies
it
lacks
the
weight
the
density
the
burn
and
the
booze
as
a
straight
porter
however
its
quite
good
theres
just
enough
vanilla
citrus
and
bubbly
sting
to
make
it
a
happy
little
beer
its
a
tad
smoky
without
being
overly
charred
and
for
once
we
have
a
porter
that
doesnt
reek
of
coffee
youll
be
able
to
have
more
than
one
bring
your
wallet
and
still
be
able
to
operate
a
power
tool
with
a
spinning
blade
maybe
overall
drinkability
outstanding
beer
wonderful
taste
and
if
this
truly
is
the
same
recipe
as
was
brewed
in
1836
then
this
is
a
beer
recipe
of
perfection
for
the
ages
if
not
well
its
still
quite
good
and
i
could
easily
have
another
one
or
two
very
good
by
itself
and
would
be
good
with
a
meal
as
well
i
had
this
by
itself
but
i
could
easily
see
having
this
with
beef
or
a
dessert
iight
herbal
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
delicate
carbonation
and
very
easy
to
drink
in
fact
it
took
me
longer
to
enter
this
than
to
drink
it
a
fine
sweedish
export
enjoyed
it
held
up
amazingly
for
how
oldlow
abv
it
was
heard
it
was
a
relatively
cheap
one
to
aquire
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
older
vintages
in
the
future
overall
this
is
nice
ill
be
grabbing
some
more
of
this
to
sample
at
various
stages
of
aging
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
baltic
porter
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
as
there
are
some
great
represenations
of
this
style
elsewhere
ordered
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
allentown
brew
works
once
i
was
shocked
to
see
how
much
they
were
charging
for
this
brew
i
could
have
found
it
cheaper
and
which
i
would
have
let
it
in
their
cooler
anyway
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
rich
black
color
the
head
was
big
and
strong
looking
at
first
but
settled
down
to
just
a
thin
tan
creamy
looking
film
over
top
of
the
brew
the
lacing
was
light
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
roasted
malts
and
just
some
minimal
fruit
elements
shining
through
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
bold
burnt
bitterness
up
front
and
some
dark
fruit
sweetness
which
faded
into
a
dark
chocolate
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
had
a
decent
thickness
to
it
overall
it
was
way
too
expensive
at
15
a
bottle
should
have
been
half
that
i
think
but
other
than
the
price
it
was
pretty
good
dr
average
range
abv
very
drinkable
and
of
a
high
price
the
quality
is
nothing
special
o
the
wellblended
flavors
of
dark
malt
are
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
still
have
some
nice
depth
there
were
some
grain
and
pot
caramel
qualities
that
are
hard
to
describe
in
there
it
is
a
great
recreation
of
a
historic
beer
and
a
lovely

never

there

there

the
beer
does
have
a

it

well
i
can

this
with

just

the

enough
to
get
through

this
beer
finishes
extremely
easy
and
leaves
a
relatively
a
clean
palate
and
like
some
have
said
so
i
tend
to
hold
off
in
this
case
however
i
figured
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
have
a
strong
porter
on
a
cold
winter
night
it
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
not
too
thick
and
green
hops
that
contribute
a

o

it

hence

the

profile
isnt
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
the
baltic

any
kind
of

style
and
this
makes
it
a
tough
one
to
recommend
especially
given
the
rarity
and
price
on
this
side
of
the
world
de
molen
remains
one
of
the
best
dutch
breweries
ive
tried
but
they
have
better
offerings
than
this
o
extraordinary
my
admiration
exceeded
my
considerable
enjoyment
the
taste
is
a
balanced
between
the
dark
malts
and
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
the
dark
malts
offer
a
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
the
alcohol
is
not
upfront
but
it
gives
the
beer
a
warming
sensation
and
a
big
mouthfeel
the
bitterness
is
93
ebu
according
to
the
label
but
never
mouthpuckering
bitter
as
said
the
beer
is
very
balanced
the
high
density
of
the
beer
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
sticky
mouthfeel
but
this
is
very
well
crafted
with
only
malts
o
other
de
molen
big
dark
brews
ive
had
have
been
nice
but
always
somehow
fell
short
of
their
potential
through
big
sweetness

carbonation
etc
this
one
avoids
those
pitfalls
and
delivers
on
all
fronts
definitely
enjoyed
it
after
some
aging
complex
and
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
the
330ml

was
a

easy
overall
this

chocolate
but
seems
a
bit
simple
otherwise
theres
a
lactic
edge
with
a
whole
bunch
of
cocoa
so
basically
milk
chocolate
theres
a
definite
caramel
malt
backbone
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
to
the
beer
but
its
buried
in
chocolate
a
very
light
touch
of
booze
theres
probably
a
light
mineralish
hop
flavor
as
well
but
its
not
easy
to
pick
out
the
taste
is
sweet
and
while
theres
a
bit
more
depth
the
beer
is
still
on
the
simple
side
here
as
well
lots
of
milk
chocolate
but
a
bit
more
malt
and
hop
complexity
particularly
in
the
finish
its
not
quite
roasty
but
theres
a
darkly
toasty
malt
flavor
in
there
the
milk
chocolate
sweetness
just
doesnt
relent
though
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
very
good
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
i
tried
the
recent
evil
twin
stout
and
porter
brewed
at
de
molen
and
they
were
great
so
i
guess
i
had
my
hopes
up
for
this
beer
and
a
couple
others
while
this
is
a
good
beer
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
tag
im
happy
with
this
one
and
might
buy
one
or
two
to
sit
on
i
doubt
ill
age
it
for
the
25
year
potential
i
see
printed
on
the
bottle
but
im
sure
a
year
or
two
would
do
it
some
good
perfect
beer
to
end
the
day
with
very
satisfying
in
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
if
you
dig
the
style
you
have
here
a
very
fine
example
my
favorite
beer
from
brouwerij
de
molen
so
far
o
a
nice
solid
porter
with
a
lot
of
flavor
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
so
the
tsar
has
fallen
but
tsarina
still
holds
the
throne
330
ml
into
tulip
d
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
when
menno
was
in
town
and
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
this
one
perhaps
some
vintages
have
held
up
better
than
others
18cl
is
the
perfect
serving
for
this
sort
of
beer
if
your
drinking
for
one
hopefully
the
batch
released
stateside
recently
will
be
as
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
very
small
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
of
booze
figs
dark
overly
ripe
plums
first
sip
is
complex
yet
in
many
ways
rather
simple
deep
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
hazel
nuts
and
a
tad
of
brown
sugar
comprise
the
taste
the
beer
is
slightly
under
carbonated
and
that
hurts
the
mouthfeel
pretty
damn
tasty
drank
side
by
side
with
a
2012
version
bought
stateside
2010
was
hands
down
better
and
really
seemed
liked
a
different
beer
the
2010
had
yeast
in
the
bottle
and
was
bottle
condition
while
the
2012
was
not
bottled
condition
really
cool
to
have
two
different
years
side
by
side
o
too
many
baltic
porters
are
almost
indistinguishable
from
an
imperial
stout
this
one
is
not
very
fruity
without
a
huge
amount
of
roasted
malt
like
youd
get
in
an
is
drinkability
is
shockingly
high
for
an
11
brew
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
a
delight
to
drink
excellent
baltic
porter
possibly
the
best
ive
had
overall
im
tending
to
give
this
one
a
5
actually
but
usually
i
only
get
there
after
i
had
a
few
this
is
the
one
id
go
back
to
the
brewery
for
so
far
after
bringing
back
a
whole
case
of
the
molen
bears
last
time
as
tasters
its
quite
alcohol
heavy
but
you
dont
get
none
of
that
when
drinking
after
maybe
it
has
such
a
great
flavor
balance
i
like
porters
but
most
of
the
time
they
are
just
a
touch
off
balance
its
too
bitter
too
milky
or
whatever
this
one
seems
to
do
everything
right
highly
advised
overall
with
winter
on
its
way
this
was
a
great
choice
for
an
evening
sipper
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
initially
it
is
pretty
bold
with
alcohol
that
tapers
off
and
becomes
more
enjoyable
it
also
has
a
little
bit
of
awkward
flavors
as
aromas
that
seemingly
burn
of
as
the
experience
continues
not
a
bad
brew
but
also
not
something
i
would
get
terribly
excited
over
getting
to
try
again
the
small
format
of
this
bottle
was
quite
ample
to
get
a
feel
for
this
was
a
solid
imperial
style
baltic
porter
that
definitely
had
some
strength
behind
it
but
the
flavors
here
never
did
quite
get
as
deep
or
robust
as
they
felt
like
they
wanted
to
the
alcohol
also
got
to
be
a
little
bit
intrusive
here
as
well
this
was
certainly
good
but
ultimately
didnt
leave
a
huge
impression
on
me
o
sharp
and
off
hodge
podge
of
really
weird
tastes
and
characteristics
unpleasant
from
start
to
finish
and
thoroughly
not
enjoyable
not
sure
if
the
bottle
iswas
infected
or
what
but
this
was
just
a
bad
beer
sad
because
i
really
enjoyed
the
tsarina
esra
reserva
that
was
consumed
sidebyside
with
this
overall
this
stuff
really
is
world
class
the
previous
small
batch
was
flat
unfortunately
but
this
one
is
just
as
good
as
i
remember
the
earlier
batches
being
a
great
look
with
a
huge
nose
and
piles
of
delicious
flavor
only
the
relatively
aggressive
heat
keeps
this
one
from
scoring
like
a
champ
definitely
worth
the
trouble
if
you
get
the
chance
highly
recommended
overall
recommended
a
good
baltic
porter
notes
again
de
molen
offers
a
tremendous
dark
brew
well
not
that
their
hoppy
stuff
is
mediocre
quite
the
contrary
but
these
dark
ales
have
a
richness
and
palate
of
their
own
well
worth
the
paid
price
for
this
little
bottle
overall
wow
what
a
beer
only
disadvantage
is
again
the
low
carbonation
of
this
the
molen
beer
o
great
flavor
profile
with
good
complexity
im
not
sure
what
the
intention
was
with
the
carbonation
but
if
it
had
more
this
would
have
been
solid
poured
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
an
average
frothy
brown
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good

had

really
still
drinks
pretty
well
without
it
i
am
not

if
this
will
actually
make
25

but
it
has
lasted
the
past
two
pretty
well
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
think
would
be
absolutely
world
class
if
it
had
a
shade
more
carbonation
as
it
is
the
look
and
feel
take
a
hit
from
the
complete
lack
of

the
nose
and
taste
are
exceptional
with
tons
of
complexity
and
all
kinds
of
different
flavors
coming
out
interesting
and
tasty
this
was
my
last
beer
of
the
tasting
and
not
a
bad
one
to
end
on
before
going
to

on
that
super

would
like
to

take
this
over

truly

an
incredibly
unique

and
a
very
smooth
taste
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
zero
perhaps
i
got
a
poor
bottle
but
the
beer
certainly
didnt
taste
spoiled
this
beer
had
no

no

no

and
tasted
kinda

was

this

kick
your
butt
if
youre
not
careful
and
likely
even
if
you
are
a
beer
to
be

but
definitely
one
to
try
very
unlike
a
lot
of
other
baltic
porters
ive
had
a
very
interesting
and
altogether
quite
tasty
beer
this
one
really
doesnt
fit
any
one
style
perfectly
probably
best
not
to
go
in
expecting
a
traditional
baltic
porter

what
an
amazing
porter
aroma
was
roasted
malt
with
slight
smokey
flavors
strong
licorice
more
alcohol
aroma
as
it
warmed
i
had
plenty
of
frothy
brown
head
after
the
initial
pour
taste
was
outstanding
for
this
porter
fullbodied
with
plenty
of
bitter
chocolate
coffee
slight
tobacco
flavor
with
an
oily
feel
very
drinkable
considering
how
high
the
alcohol
level
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
of
this
stuff
drinkability
all
in
all
it
really
is
a
fine
beer
normally
i
do
not
rate
much
beers
im
simply
too
lazy
but
to
rate
this
one
i
had
to
enter
a
few
other
ratings
to
get
to
20
reviews
so
i
could
enter
this
new
beer
to
the
database
and
i
think
it
was
was
worth
it
this
beer
is
absolutely
the
best
beer
ever
brewed
during
the
last
40
years
before
that
i
have
no
knowledge
in
the
netherlands
just
amazing
i
do
like
porters
and
stouts
a
lot
and
this
baltic
porter
has
all
it
needs
the
aroma
is
very
strong
chocolate
roasted
malty
hops
the
flavor
just
the
same
and
the
mouthfeel
how
do
they
do
it
its
so
full
so
warming
so
silky
and
oily
so
warming
and
above
all
that
so
well
balanced

aroma
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
it
is
less

more
of
a

taste
and
has
some
toffee
and
a
strong
roasted
bready
sensation
fuller
bodied
not
watery
smooth
but
not
sticky
either
and
goes
down
easy
with
a
dry
finish
not
the
most
flavorful
or
complex
porter
one
will
find
but
hit
the
spot
and
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
easy
drinking
yet
quite
complex
with
nearly
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
that
honestly
tastes
seemingly
identical
to
what
it
was
like
23
years
ago
cellaring
this
has
seemingly
done
nothing
to
benefit
or
degrade
this
brew
o
i
expected
more
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
d
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
that
has
held
up
quite
well
nothing
mindblowing
here
but
if
you
like
the
style
then
you
should
really
try
this
as
its
a
very
convincing
attempt
by
an
american
brewery
just
make
sure
to
trade
for
a
newer
vintage
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
id
gladly
drink
it
again
overall
a
really
stellar
baltic
porter
very
true
to
the
baltic
porter
style
great
job
on
this
beer
foothills
pretty
damn
good
baltic
porter
roasty
chocolate
with
a
slight
milk
stout

thing
going
on
thanks
taturbo
altogether
average
and
unexciting
o
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
its
up
there
with
smuutynoses
baltic
porter
huge
fan
id
love
to
have
this
beer
again
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
smooth
beige
head
it
smells
of
sweet
and
bitter
dark
chocolates
light
roast
and
is
really
smooth
the
flavors
follow
the
same
lines
it
has
nice
and
delicate
dark
chocolate
light
roast
mild
bitterness
and
is
just
really
smooth
the
flavors
are
really
well
integrated
it
drinks
lighter
but
is
a
nice
fit
for
the
style
its
really
drinkable
and
isnt
too
sweet
and
doesnt
show
any
of
the
9
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
baltic
porter
its
definitely
worth
trying
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
for
the
style
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
i
really
liked
the
bittersweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
sweetness
to
it
very
nice
beer
overall
o
this
is
spot
on
for
a
baltic
porter
great
flavor
great
balance
very
enjoyable
o
surprisingly
i
really
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
had
good
roasted
flavors
with
just
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
to
it
would
gladly
drink
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
had
plenty
of
flavor
and
was
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
i
have
had
recently
i
didnt
detect
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
this
one
i
think
the
year
in
the
cellar
did
this
one
some
good
overall
a
solid
baltic
porter
a
wonderful
warmup
for
a
cold
dark
autumn
evening
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
i
get
the
chance
it
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
and
comes
into
its
own
tjburgess
sent
an
awesome
bif
box
that
included
this
bottle
much
thanks
man
overall
impression
really
tasty
but
the
feel
could
be
more
chill
worth
a
try
thanks
mikegroove
o
a
very
nice
porter
could
use
more
roasted
notes
overall
one
i
would
definitely
purchase
if
available
in
my
area
do
this
beer
really
brings
out
the
best
qualities
of
the
malt
that
is
present
it
is
not
devoted
to
just
one
facet
of
malt
qualityeitherwhile
the
flavor
is
darker
than
the
smell
both
bring
some
unexpected
elements
there
are
some
rough
edges
to
the
texture
however
that
add
to
palate
fatigue
overall
a
really
intense
baltic
porter
a
big
flavorful
beer
to
be
enjoyed
turned
out
to
be
a
very
nice
choice
for
review
1000
o
overall
not
a
bad
porter
it
fits
the
bill
but
i
think
this
might
a
little
better
with
a
better
body
and
more
roast
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
3
5
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
easily
grab
several
more
bottles
not
that
i
am
in
winstonsalem
too
often
but
when
i
am
next
ill
see
if
they
have
this
one
well
done
foothills
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
in
large
part
because
of
that
overroastedness
and
a
diluted
wateriness
remiscent
of
that
coffe
pot
sitting
too
long
overall
its
a
good
beer
as
we
all
get
more
critical
of
overpriced
bombers
id
say
this
one
is
just
good
enough
to
meet
the
big
bottle
scored
this
as
an
extra
from
hodgin
thanks
shannon
poured
into
my
new
belgium
globe
beautiful
looking
beer
with
a
black
body
slight
offwhite
thin
head
which
disolves
into
a
medium
ringsubtle
lacing
looks
great
smell
is
all
malt
with
a
nice
hop
note
reminds
me
of
home
brewing
that
smell
i
love
it
taste
is
rich
malt
at
tad
bit
of
pete
slight
hop
sting
smooth
though
nice
this
beer
has
a
creamy
mouthfeelwith
good
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
nice
presence
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
9
percent
apv
beer
i
would
seek
this
one
out
d
nice
complexity
and
balance
and
absolutely
delicious
another
great
beer
from
foothills
and
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
ive
had
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
definitely
get
another
bottle
or
two
pours
with
generous
head
below
sits
a
super
dark
deep
yet
shiny
mahoganylike
color
dessertish
and
nutty
aromas
lift
from
the
glass
maybe
a
touch
of
must
coffee
whipped
cream
hazelnuts
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
around
the
edges
flavors
again
have
a
dessertish
quality
and
a
nutty
character
like
hazelnuts
with
some
creamy
vibes
going
on
as
well
its
sweet
to
a
point
but
it
doesnt
come
across
as
overly
sweet
as
the
nutty
qualities
of
the
malts
the
creaminess
of
the
body
and
the
touch
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
make
it
all
come
together
quite
nicely
o
a
really
tasty
beer
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
another
one
i
would
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
this
isnt
as
intense
or
complex
as
some
of
the
other
baltic
porters
ive
had
i
do
like
the
way
everything
fits
together
in
this
one
though
overall
a
solid
and
yummy
choice
pours
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
thin
edging
of
dark
brown
up
near
the
thin
creamy
head
a
permanent
tan
film
coats
the
top
deep
roasted
chocolatecovered
dark
fruit
aromas
with
a
spot
of
age
that
melds
with
a
smooth
hit
of
alcohol
molasses
and
a
trace
of
smoky
char
big
roasted
malt
flavor
very
dark
chocolate
sweetness
not
too
sweet
moderate
purple
fruit
esters
in
the
middle
leading
to
a
dry
bitter
roast
finish
heavy
all
around
but
not
too
viscous
with
very
fine
carbonation
mmmm
nicely
done
overall
i
love
the
balance
between
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
nice
and
smooth
would
definitely
have
it
again
overall
this
is
the
best
baltic
porter
i
have
ever
had
even
topping
my
previous
favorite
of
smuttynose
big
beer
series
offering
definitely
more
chocolate
forward
and
less
roasty
than
typical
for
the
style
but
that
suits
my
preferences
perfectly
this
continues
my
weekend
of
amazingbest
beers
i
have
ever
had
weekend
how
can
this
trend
continue
each
one
is
stellar
and
a
or
higher
rating
hooray
for
beer
trading
great
job
foothills
i
hope
to
sample
more
of
their
beers
in
the
future
as
this
one
is
a
real
winner
and
highly
recommended
overall
its
a
nice
take
on
a
baltic
porter
not
overly
sweet
yet
the
dark
fruit
component
typical
of
the
style
seems
to
be
absent
would
drink
again
anytime
overall
a
great
baltic
porter
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
i
have
had
thanks
again
alex
o
great
stuff
but
the
one
by
smuttynose
continues
to
be
the
benchmark
for
me
in
the
baltic
arena
o
definately
wish
i
had
more
of
this
one
and
will
attempt
to
track
another
bottle
down
the
road
4
5
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
baltic
porter
thanks
to
drfabulous
for
sharing
at
the
inappropriate
for
the
weather
big
beer
day
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
and
i
highly
suggest
seeking
it
out
heavy
carbonation
at
the
start
of
each
sip
masks
the
bitter
malts
enough
to
let
the
sweet
fruit
start
come
out
and
it
makes
for
a
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
carbonation
is
important
for
most
beers
but
here
it
is
especially
crucial
medium
bodied
this
beers
weight
belies
its
huge
flavor
and
very
dark
heavy
appearance
despite
all
the
tastes
and
smells
being
so
strong
the
beer
balances
itself
pretty
well
making
for
a
moderately
drinkable
beer
this
isnt
a
porter
you
can
chug
or
anything
but
it
offers
a
lot
with
each
sip
o
the
bitterness
would
get
annoying
after
just
one
fuller
medium
body
somewhat
higher
carbonation
dry
and
chewy
on
the
palate
drinks
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
bold
flavor
profile
not
really
the
best
porter
ive
had
but
still
a
quality
example
for
sure
o
gave
it
a
3
5
overall
given
my
range
of
3
0
to
4
i
get
it
has
alcohol
and
i
love
that
but
it
just
seemed
like
it
was
all
about
that
nothing
distinctive
other
than
that
good
overall
porter
d
a
really
solid
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
which
i
found
enjoyable
overall
im
really
impressed
with
foothills
brewing
company
beer
baltic
porter
isnt
quite
the
gem
that
sexual
chocolate
is
but
its
damn
good
the
flavor
is
absolutely
huge
if
youre
in
to
big
time
roasty
charred
or
burnt
flavors
baltic
porter
is
for
you
i
could
handle
a
little
more
heft
in
terms
of
body
but
thats
about
it
this
is
very
good
stuff
as
it
is
thanks
dan
really
enjoyed
this
one
drinkable
yep
drinkabilitythis
is
a
good
example
of
a
baltic
porter
its
easy
to
drink
and
true
to
style
im
a
big
fan
of
nearly
everything
i
have
tried
from
foothills
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
poured
from
the
bottle
the
color
is
a
deep
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
beige
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
film
surrounded
by
a
foamy
halo
the
aroma
is
rich
and
potent
with
notes
of
cocoa
powder
and
licorice
the
flavor
likewise
features
a
dark
roasted
malt
profile
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
licorice
but
a
nice
pine
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
booze
is
also
in
there
the
veryfine
carbonation
provides
a
silky
texture
that
works
well
with
the
slightly
warming
booziness
overall
this
beer
certainly
blurs
the
line
between
baltic
porter
and
imperial
stout
if
there
is
such
a
line
and
it
is
yet
another
wellcrafted
flavorful
and
enjoyable
beer
from
foothills
m
slightly
viscous
velvety
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
baltic
porter
is
a
style
thats
really
been
growing
on
me
over
the
past
several
months
and
this
one
stands
out
as
one
of
the
best
ive
had
its
flavorful
while
retaining
a
lightness
of
body
that
increases
drinkability
immensely

it

however
its
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style

tasty
and
the

is

i
would
definitely
drink
this

nuff
said
once
again
thanks
ewright
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
ecru
foam
the
smell
is
of
slight
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
not
too
much
other
than
that
the
smell
carries
on
greatly
into
the
taste
of
the
beer
as
there
is
a
nice
slight
roasted
quality
to
the
beer
along
with
the
malty
chocolate
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
light
comparatively
to
other
porters
that
ive
had
the
good
fortune
to
taste
in
my
time
i
must
say
that
even
though
most
everything
about
this
beer
was
good
there
is
a
nice
wonderful
quality
that
it
conveys
overall
its
a
quality
rich
chocolate
porter
d
good
brew
with
nice
drinkability
but
a
bottle
definitely
worth
splitting
with
a
friend
very
nice
feel
going
on
in
this
one
thanks
jon
this
beer
is
all
about
the
smooth
too
bad
i
only
had
one
82nd
what
a
nice
porter
from
an
up
and
coming
brewery
as
they
bottle
more
they
will
become
more
popular
d
for
the
last
beer
of
the
night
this
is
going
down
quite
quickly
fruity
roasty
bitter
and
very
smooth
look
forward
to
having
this
one
again
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
beer
definitely
didnt
disappoint
another
good
beer
from
north
carolina
sweet
lingering
aftertaste
great
beer
not
as
thick
as
sexual
chocolate
but
good
m
light
to
medium
body
chewy
lightly
carbonated
somewhat
watery
at
times
huge
thanks
goes
out
to
bobertkuekn
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
as
an
extra
pour
is
dark
brown
but
lots
of
ruby
red
is
showing
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
small
tan
head
forms
and
then
drops
quickly
wonderful
malty
aroma
that
consists
of
roast
coffee
chocolate
and
some
light
alcohol
taste
is
right
on
par
with
the
nose
loads
of
roasty
toasty
maltiness
some
coffee
and
bitterness
with
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
on
the
finish
very
well
balanced
between
the
roasty
malts
and
sweetness
with
only
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
mediumfull
body
with
just
enough
carbonation
very
good
beer
and
easily
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
ive
ever
had
thanks
robert
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
one
of
foothills
best
it
has
some
serious
competition
but
a
great
example
of
a
style
that
doesnt
get
talked
about
a
lot
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
if
not
a
great
beer
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
baltic
porters
and
this
ones
no
different
a
ton
of
interesting
yeast
and
fruit
notes
emerge
from
this
one
and
if
foothills
had
kept
the
alcohol
heat
in
check
a
little
bit
more
this
one
would
have
been
near
world
class
lets
hope
they
bring
it
back
next
year
and
perhaps
turn
it
in
to
a
seasonal
bottle
release
id
love
to
get
some
bottles
of
this
one
to
lay
down
and
see
if
the
heat
dissipates
a
little
also
please
put
this
in
23year
pappy
van
winkle
barrels
kthx
notes
damn
fine
maintains
the
porter
body
but
packs
in
a
lot
more
roast
and
flavor
really
well
done
j
excellent
glad
i
have
another
bottle
that
can
rest
in
full
darkness
for
a
year
or
two
before
i
revisit
already
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
happens
good
lord
it
is
delicious
creamy
and
smooth
chocolate
and
caramel
presence
is
large
rolling
over
my
tongue
sensuously
down
my
throat
the
alcohol
is
subliminal
you
are
aware
but
can
barely
detect
it
beneath
these
waves
of
pleasure
slight
bit
of
roast
accompanies
the
flavor
really
outstandingly
finished
perfect
fg
leaving
it
mediumfull
bodied
and
so
outlandishly
rich
big
fan
happy
to
have
an
extra
bottle
just
laying
aboot
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
smell
of
burnt
caramel
some
coffee
smell
taste
is
superb
roasty
rich
and
flavorful
a
bit
thin
but
still
has
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
would
gladly
reach
for
another
slightly
thin
and
not
as
rich
or
full
as
expected
though
a
bit
deeper
at
room
temperature
drinkability
is
fine
but
the
overall
composition
of
this
beer
doesnt
necessarily
encourage
further
exploration
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
but
most
likely
a
one
and
done
great
clarity
roasted
malt
and
mellow
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
escapes
from
the
mocha
colored
head
strong
bitter
roasted
malt
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
definitely
not
as
much
chocolate
coming
through
from
the
nose
this
is
mostly
roasted
barley
im
getting
theres
an
astringent
bitter
finish
from
it
very
bold
and
robust
but
id
love
to
see
some
more
flavors
than
just
bitterburnt
malt
creamy
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
d
very
good
porter
good
overall
thick
velvet
like
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
2
best
baltic
porters
ive
had
are
brewed
right
here
in
nc
with
foothills
and
duckrabbit
poured
into
a
tulip
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
few
crimson
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
off
white
head
with
pretty
good
staying
power
nose
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
and
a
really
nice
dark
fruit
presence
the
taste
combines
the
roast
and
fruit
very
well
good
body
that
isnt
too
full
drinks
really
well
im
glad
they
finally
bottled
this
d
very
nice
overall
i
couldnt
believe
this
was
a
9
beer
as
it
didnt
drink
or
taste
like
one
would
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
md
felt
lighter
than
expected
but
still
felt
good
with
good
drinkability
the
beer
was
smooth
creamy
and
had
good
carbonation
if
not
for
the
higher
abv
i
could
have
drunk
this
all
night
the
flavor
has
a
bitter
cocoa
taste
when
cool
and
light
raisiny
and
dark
toasted
malt
flavor
w
mild
grainy
and
woody
accents
the
piney
hop
addition
in
the
latter
part
of
the
taste
is
complimentary
and
the
yeast
adds
a
creamy
slightly
smooth
tinge
to
the
chocolate
malt
utilized
in
the
taste
a
lovely
beer
and
a
quality
baltic
porter
imo
there
has
only
been
two
opportunities
thus
far
for
me
to
taste
foothills
beers
but
both
have
been
very
high
quality
this
is
no
exception
i
recommend
this
very
drinkable
d
i
typically
find
that
the
baltic
porter
style
is
a
tough
one
for
me
to
wrap
my
head
around
i
enjoyed
this
for
its
complexity
and
bold
flavors
but
it
is
just
not
something
that
i
generally
crave
that
said
this
is
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
would
have
liked
more
sweeter
accents
chocolate
vanilla
caramel
it
is
still
good
just
not
at
the
top
of
the
style
for
me
and
not
at
the
top
of
foothills
brews
that
ive
had
keep
up
the
good
work
though
foothills
a
very
excellent
tribute
to
pop
the
caps
5th
anniversary
d
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
in
this
beer
the
flavors
are
excellent
and
pleasing
overall
this
tastes
a
lot
like
a
stout
to
me
but
perhaps
a
little
lighter
and
with
a
little
less
hops
the
beer
goes
down
is
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
without
bells
and
whistles
that
is
just
very
well
done
not
terribly
complex
but
close
to
flawless
well
worth
a
shot
drinkability
for
as
high
of
an
abv
as
this
is
extremely
so
i
am
so
thrilled
i
was
able
to
try
this
an
extremely
good
beer
and
being
enjoyed
immensely
on
this
finally
somewhat
cooler
southern
california
night
thanks
again
to
thomashardy
for
allowing
me
to
try
this
beer
overall
fairly
boring
for
a
bp
kind
of
bland
how
does
this
beer
get
an
a
on
ba
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
but
really
wow
a
bit
high
of
a
rating
imo
d
a
decent
example
of
the
style
though
not
stellar
id
be
curious
to
have
this
again
as
no
one
that
tried
this
that
night
was
particularly
impressed
d
an
enjoyable
baltic
porter
its
a
beer
i
would
definitely
try
again
and
is
nicely
balanced
but
nothing
stood
out
too
much
have
a
bottle
of
this
so
ill
be
interested
to
try
it
again
beer
is
a
little
thin
its
mildly
sweet
and
has
a
bitterness
at
the
back
and
a
mild
aftertaste
it
is
a
little
ashy
in
the
mouth
and
there
is
very
little
carbonation
on
the
palate
this
tastes
a
lot
like
a
lot
of
other
baltic
porters
ive
had
nothing
too
special
or
odd
here
while
i
was
drinking
this
beer
i
was
wondering
what
would
make
it
better
i
decided
smoke
this
would
have
been
much
improved
with
some
smoked
malt
maybe
some
spruce
smoked
malt
with
a
better
hopping
schedule
never
mind
foothills
ill
make
that
beer
myself
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
collars
around
the
inside
rim
of
the
glass
strong
cocoa
aroma
mixed
with
some
malt
type
sweetnes
the
taste
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
and
to
be
honest
not
very
good
lots
of
leather
tobacco
and
an
overly
charred
roast
cocoa
flavor
that
really
kills
this
beer
ends
fairly
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
overall
not
a
good
beer
and
am
surprised
as
i
enjoy
most
other
foothills
beers
dthis
is
ok
taste
is
better
than
the
nose
the
flavors
have
a
much
less
burnt
components
and
ash
than
the
nose
plain
but
not
bad
picked
this
up
at
the
bottle
release
awhile
back
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
pours
pitch
black
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
slowly
subsided
to
one
finger
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
cream
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
cream
dark
fruit
and
subtle
alcohol
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
still
quite
an
excellent
brew
it
was
better
on
tap
if
im
honest
but
still
very
nice
the
flavor
just
wasnt
as
pronounced
as
on
tap
but
it
is
still
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
this
beer
was
drinkable
but
not
really
worthy
of
purchase
a
few
flaws
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
bring
down
what
potentially
could
have
been
a
very
good
beer
and
make
it
just
decent
way
more
drinkable
than
it
needs
to
be
very
tasty
beer
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
heres
the
thing
with
this
beer
the
flavor
creeps
up
on
you
and
its
complexities
unroll
and
unfold
over
time
and
with
warming
at
first
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
and
now
im
halfway
through
the
bomber
thinking
its
pretty
damn
great
the
world
needs
more
baltic
porters
and
im
glad
this
one
is
a
mere
hours
drive
away
while
it
lasts
dark
and
opaque
brown
in
the
glass
more
of
a
ruby
red
when
held
to
the
light
its
capped
by
an
inch
of
tan
froth
that
displays
solid
retention
the
aroma
is
clean
but
mild
grainy
and
malty
predominantly
there
are
notes
of
toasted
bread
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
licorice
but
its
not
outstanding
in
any
way
the
palate
is
nice
medium
in
body
almost
light
for
the
abv
with
a
dry
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
opening
that
leads
into
flavors
of
burnt
toast
black
licorice
and
mild
herbal
hops
while
this
isnt
the
most
complex
baltic
porter
ive
ever
had
it
is
wellcrafted
and
enjoyable
a
solid
porter
an
average
baltic
porter
wanted
to
like
it
just
not
a
great
bp
d
its
good
but
it
wasnt
sweet
enough
for
me
to
be
considered
a
topnotch
baltic
porter
good
not
great
flavor
is
good
pretty
robust
semi
thick
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
pretty
low
booze
malts
chocolates
coffee
tobacco
and
charnotes
a
very
tasty
baltic
porter
not
as
sweet
as
some
but
good
the
booze
is
somewhat
high
but
not
a
major
factor
glad
i
got
to
try
a
bottle
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
brew
it
seems
like
it
definitely
belongs
in
the
porter
category
its
not
so
much
a
stout
to
me
a
thick
porter
but
not
necessarily
a
stout
definitely
worth
trying
overall
impression
exceedingly
tasty
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
dark
rich
smooth
and
delicious
i
was
happily
surprised
by
this
one
while
it
may
be
overshadowed
by
all
the
cool
barrelaged
releases
this
is
an
great
beer
that
was
easily
worth
the
5
hour
trip
alone
a
true
beauty
full
bodied
without
being
too
chewy
or
cloying
alcohol
is
warming
without
being
hot
and
nosehairsingeing
i
feel
like
such
a
homer
giving
these
guys
good
reviews
all
the
time
and
being
a
local
but
damn
the
beer
speaks
for
itself
a
benchmark
in
the
style
in
my
opinion
overall
really
a
massively
complex
beer
an
possibly
my
new
favorite
of
the
style
it
will
get
overshadowed
with
the
ba
sc
release
but
it
really
should
be
tried
outstanding
beer
had
this
one
ontap
while
waiting
in
line
for
the
ba
sexual
chocolate
release
at
the
brewery
served
in
a
goblet
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
dark
malts
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
smooth
amount
of
dark
malts
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
but
is
still
smooth
an
enjoyable
even
outside
on
a
summer
day
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
ba
sexual
chocolate
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
very
drinkable
for
me
the
flavor
profile
is
balanced
and
a
bit
tame
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
well
done
jamie
good
brew
the
mouth
is
perfectly
creamy
just
a
velvet
coating
all
over
the
palate
wonderful
great
creamy
flavors
that
finish
just
as
smooth
lots
of
dark
chocolate
noted
the
alcohol
does
not
make
itself
know
in
the
flavor
at
all
hidden
well
i
can
feel
it
though
some
dark
fruits
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
splendid
offering
id
have
to
have
it
side
by
side
with
the
sc
to
compare
but
it
definitely
is
as
good
as
sc
for
sure
heres
to
foothills
for
making
my
wish
come
true
and
bringing
this
beer
back

not
anything

intensely
roasted

i
could

this
all
day
long
no
notice
of
the
abv
in
flavor
just
in
feel
nothing
too
complex
or
overwhelming
just
right
overall
a
really
lipsmacking
beer
i
finally
got
an
opportunity
to
crack
open
a
bottle
this
evening
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
poured
into
adfh
snifter
with
adark
brown
appearance
and
a
quickly
dissipating
one
finger
tan
head
smells
of
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
raisins
figs
maybe
tastes
of
rich

the
alcohol
is
wellhiddenmakingthis
one
quaffable
baltic
porter
and
not
to
beat
a
dead
horse
but
this
really
another
topnotch
brew
from
foothills
and
even
better
than
the
sexual
chocolate
and
thats
saying
a
lot
highly
recommended
could
have
had
a
slightly
bigger
mouthfeel
for
me
thought
it
was
a
touch
too
thin
also
could
have
been
a
bit
creamier
all
in
all
a
very
good
baltic
porter
that
is
very
drinkable
the
nine
percent
doesnt
get
in
the
way
at
all
nice
job
foothills
i
really
didnt
want
to
be
the
guy
who
gives
the
homer
beer
a
good
score
but
man
it
really
is
good
better
than
this
years
sexual
chocolate
imho
there
was
a
bit
of
a
pffft
when
i
cracked
the
growler
good
sign
this
one
looked
pretty
thick
on
the
pour
very
dark
nearly
black
with
ruby
edges
thin
cap
of
small
brown
bubbles
lots
of
very
fine
spotty
lacing
plenty
of
malt
in
the
nose
a
nice
combination
of
caramel
and
toffee
a
light
chocolatey
roast
light
driedripe
fruit
notes
along
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
just
a
hint
of
smoke
rich
sweet
malt
flavour
toffee
and
caramel
milk
chocolate
faint
smoke
light
fruit
character
mild
roast
bitterness
is
restrained
but
comes
forward
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
sweetness
lingers
just
short
of
really
full
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
silky
texture
with
a
bit
of
dryness
very
mild
warmth
great
stuff
so
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
okay
i
accidentally
purchased
this
at
moondogs
at
mellow
mushroom
little
did
i
realize
until
someone
asked
what
i
was
drinking
did
i
remember
this
was
last
years
best
of
the
baltic
porters
not
only
that
i
was
sipping
on
the
2006
version
man
what
good
stuff
worth
every
penny
7
00
nice
deep
dark
hues
with
lots
of
coffee
chocolate
licorice
notes
definitely
try
to
get
your
hands
on
some
wow
this
beer
would
be
great
with
about
a
year
of
age
on
it
the
alcohol
would
settle
allowing
the
malt
to
step
forward
in
the
aftertaste
the
dark
flavors
would
meld
and
the
ashy
from
the
dark
grains
would
fade
a
great
beer
with
great
potential
a
fantastic
bp
all
around
its
too
bad
foothills
doesnt
have
this
available
more
often
most
baltic
porters
i
have
had
not
many
have
an
oily
sort
of
industrial
taste
hard
to
describe
which
i
attribute
to
eastern
european
hopstypically
unfamiliar
to
my
american
taste
this
porter
had
that
slight
distinction
but
in
a
very
drinkable
pleasant
waydefinitely
as
you
can
see
by
my
scores
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
ever
had
i
spoke
with
the
brewmaster
at
foothills
and
apparently
the
recipe
was
a
gold
medal
what
competition
homebrew
which
was
adapted
for
this
commercial
beer
baltic
porter
is
not
my
favorite
style
however
this
baltic
porter
is
about
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
foothills
which
is
an
excellent
brewery
pint
at
the
flying
saucer
in
charlotte
had
a
sample
of
this
great
brew
at
the
world
beer
festival
this
past
weekend
in
durham
nc
inky
black
with
a
tannish
head
that
dissipates
to
nice
lacing
aroma
is
all
you
could
hope
for
malty
caramelly
dark
chocolately
all
up
front
giving
hints
of
things
to
come
taste
is
even
better
with
all
the
aroma
promised
which
gradually
adds
hints
of
licorice
with
just
enough
hopkick
to
balance
things
nicely
fullbodied
in
the
mouth
and
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
right
up
there
with
the
best
baltic
porters
ive
had
drinkability
rich
and
complex
this
has
an
intriguing
combination
of
fruity
and
bitter
elements
body
is
huge
silky
and
luxurious
full
creamy
mouthfeel
is
accentuated
by
gentle
carbonation
and
a
texture
like
good
chocolate
milk
sinfull
and
incredible
very
bold
taste
strong
for
a
porter
definite
notes
of
black
cherry
chocolate
and
coffee
not
for
those
just
starting
to
try
porters
or
stouts
best
porter
ever
ticks
all
the
boxes
sets
the
standard
for
all
others
to
compete
with
a
stunning
beer
to
be
sipped
as
slowly
as
possible
amazingly
rich
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
good
on
a
cold
day
tastes
amazing
starts
off
vanilla
cherry
then
tobacco
then
a
little
vinegar
ends
with
dry
dark
chocolate
this
was
one
of
my
more
successful
cellar
attempts
think
port
meets
porter
rich
sweet
and
smooth
the
aftertaste
features
a
sugary
almost
treacle
finish
if
you
like
your
beers
dry
avoid
this
one
this
is
extremely
sweet
otherwise
make
an
effort
to
try
this
as
a
port
lover
this
bring
two
of
my
passions
together
superbly
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
one
of
my
original
wants
from
when
i
joined
ba
and
i
was
fortunate
to
procure
a
bottle
at
the
state
liquor
store
in
stowe
vt
on
122414
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
loose
fizzy
quarter
inch
khakicolored
head
head
quickly
dissipates
into
oily
droplets
and
specks
and
strands
of
lacing
nose
is
vinous
and
roasty
with
kiss
of
smoke
cocoa
and
booze
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
you
definitely
get
that
lagered
quality
in
the
flavor
profile
hard
to
describe
what
it
is
but
its
there
theres
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
grapey
quality
that
comes
out
towards
the
back
and
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
carbonation
just
shy
of
lively
a
light
acidity
and
a
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
not
my
favorite
baltic
porter
but
very
much
true
to
style
not
something
i
would
recommend
for
extended
cellaring
as
i
can
see
this
oxidizing
with
time
enjoy
rich
complex
and
sweet
full
of
flavors
like
black
forest
cake
cherries
dried
fruits
bannana
molasses
coffee
toffee
and
many
other
rich
and
delicate
flavors
my
mate
who
tasted
this
with
my
though
it
tasted
like
cough
medicine
but
hes
an
idiot
would
definitely
buy
this
again
poured
from
the
austere
looking
jet
black
bottle
into
a
snifter
pitch
brownishblack
brew
with
next
to
no
head
just
a
stippling
of
dark
rusty
brown
bubbles
against
the
sides
of
the
glass
intensely
sweet
nose
of
dark
dried
fruits
cherries
prunes
toffee
rum
licorice
candy
and
enough
roasted
malts
melding
with
the
sweet
elements
to
evoke
coffee
liqueur
wonderful
stuff
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
either
although
be
forewarned
this
is
sweet
like
in
samichlaus
classic
bier
territory
flat
almost
noncarbonated
and
drinks
like
dessert
although
there
is
a
roasted
licorice
element
that
engages
the
palate
after
a
while
coffee
toffee
black
forest
cake
and
molasses
with
just
the
barest
hint
of
smoke
at
first
apparently
theres
hops
in
here
but
i
do
not
taste
them
this
is
a
challenging
brew
to
rate
one
has
to
evaluate
on
the
basis
of
the
style
guidelines
and
what
the
brewery
is
intending
to
execute
here
far
too
sweet
on
most
nights
for
me
but
sipped
slowly
and
shared
this
is
a
sublime
brew
earthy
rich
and
fruity
with
a
slow
building
alcohol
warmth
like
a
high
end
rum
and
an
emergent
cigarlike
smokiness
on
a
packaging
note
the
date
is
printed
on
the
back
label
with
other
pertinent
information
a
good
thing
but
is
very
light
and
mostly
unreadable
a
bad
thing
o
a
really
big
but
delicious
brew
really
heavy
on
the
licorice
and
cherrywood
to
start
but
rounds
out
afterwards
with
those
classic
dark
beer
flavours
pbgc
poured
an
opaque
black
back
lighting
did
nothing
more
than
lighten
the
beer
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
to
a
dark
brown
the
aroma
was
fabulous
a
combination
of
chocolate
alcohol
dark
ripe
fruits
and
wet
autumn
leaves
pouring
produced
just
over
1
of
crema
coloured
creamy
head
which
lasted
for
45
minutes
before
disappearing
completely
leaving
no
lacing
or
spotting
down
the
glass
its
flavour
was
as
wonderful
as
the
aroma
with
sweet
dark
malts
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
ending
with
a
modest
bitterness
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
aroma
becomes
more
noticeable
and
the
already
modestly
bitter
finish
mellows
further
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
lingers
and
though
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
lingering
aftertastes
it
was
a
shame
that
i
eventually
had
to
brush
my
teeth
before
going
to
sleep
trois
mousquetaires
has
the
carbonation
just
right
on
this
one
and
pbgc
is
full
bodied
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
of
an
oatmeal
stout
one
thing
that
struck
me
about
the
beer
was
the
variability
in
taste
one
mouthful
the
chocolate
dominates
in
the
next
the
dark
fruits
are
more
pronounced
in
another
the
malt
sweetness
is
front
and
centre
pbgc
is
a
complex
beer
but
not
so
complex
that
the
individual
aromas
and
tastes
get
lost
in
summary
a
wonderful
beer
the
only
area
in
which
it
falls
down
is
the
value
for
money
factor
at
9
95
a
bottle
ill
have
to
put
this
beer
in
the
special
treat
category
in
a
750
ml
bottle
pbgc
is
best
shared
or
at
least
stretched
out
over
a
long
winter
night
overall
really
good
beer
with
slight
hints
of
greatness
very
good
representation
of
the
baltic
porter
style
and
why
i
like
it
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
an
excellent
baltic
porter
the
label
is
detailed
about
the
ingredients
in
the
beer
gives
an
added
dimension
to
the
tasting
it
includes
the
malts
hopspairings
aging
glassware
and
serving
temp
o
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
now
and
each
time
it
has
had
a
little
more
age
on
it
this
particular
bottle
is
just
under
a
year
and
each
time
it
has
gotten
better
this
beer
is
a
steal
at
9
a
bottle
and
is
well
deserving
of
its
high
ranking
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
velvety
smooth
softly
bubbly
mouthfeel
thats
probably
around
half
foamy
and
half
smooth
the
result
is
quite
nice
for
the
beer
actually
fairly
exceptional
and
within
the
guidelines
for
the
style
ethanol
is
exceptionally
well
concealed
for
a
10
abv
beer
only
the
slightest
of
heat
in
the
nostrils
and
tingle
on
back
of
throat
closes
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
palate
m
medium
leading
to
more
full
bodied
high
carbonation
overall
an
incredible
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
complex
i
love
the
notes
of
dark
fruit
only
negative
is
that
it
is
slightly
sweet
but
it
still
works
well
for
this
sipper
grande
cuvée
porter
baltique
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
reminded
me
of
the
better
traditional
lagered
examples
of
this
style
produced
by
a
handful
of
breweries
in
the
baltic
region
i
probably
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
a
very
fine
beer
one
that
might
improve
with
some
age
on
it
for
now
while
it
was
quite
delicious
it
was
extremely
intense
in
its
flavors
and
a
bit
unrelenting
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
where
ive
truly
understood
of
sharing
a
bottle
because
with
other
large
containers
drinking
a
bottle
over
34
hours
still
is
not
a
chore
but
with
this
it
was
still
highly
recommended
for
those
enjoying
the
style
or
those
looking
for
something
extreme
good
sippin
beer
be
sure
to
give
yourself
enough
time
to
work
your
way
through
the
bottle
overall10
no
way
this
beer
is
so
good
you
dont
even
notice
it
sign
me
up
for
another
d
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
very
complex
and
interesting
but
drinks
pretty
smooth
for
all
that
is
going
on
overall
a
very
good
baltic
porter
somewhat
better
balanced
than
their
2013
bourbonbrandy
barrel
version
but
then
this
2013
edition
is
meants
to
be
overthetop
to
a
point
so
its
hard
to
compare
this
standard
version
of
their
baltic
porter
gets
the
job
done
in
a
most
amazing
way
rich
and
warm
and
pleasing
overall
a
unique
take
and
very
memorable
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
much
to
enjoy
here
i
liked
this
overall
it
is
full
and
rich
although
it
may
be
a
bit
sweet
to
drink
too
much
of
it
excellent
baltic
porter
while
the
aroma
is
only
ok
the
flavor
is
fantastic
very
rich
and
complex
the
beer
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
laces
the
nose
is
quite
fruity
toasty
almost
smoky
and
has
a
deep
molasses
sweetness
the
taste
is
booming
with
far
more
pronounced
smokiness
and
fruity
sweetness
this
is
unlike
any
baltic
porter
ive
had
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
interesting
flavor
layered
on
top
of
the
smooth
rich
velvety
mouthfeel
honestly
im
a
bit
taken
aback
by
the
strangeness
of
this
brew
considering
the
smokiness
the
beer
has
more
carbonation
that
id
prefer
but
the
flavor
richness
masks
its
huge
abv
well
this
is
definitely
a
world
class
baltic
porter
with
an
incredible
amount
of
complexity
and
flavor
overall
pretty
nice
beer
goods
malts
and
lager
feel
the
aged
feel
was
nice
other
than
the
slight
oxidation
tasty
with
a
long
great
finish
o
overall
i
was
happily
impressed
by
this
beer
while
everything
was
nice
as
a
whole
the
lingering
finish
is
just
awesome
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
dark
sugar
pop
im
not
sure
where
to
place
it
with
baltic
porters
but
i
can
surely
say
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
could
use
higher
carbonation
to
cut
the
sweetness
overall
a
classic
that
has
great
potential
for
aging
excellent
all
around
overall
a
fantastic
blend
of
flavour
and
silky
mouthfeel
make
for
a
great
brew
everything
balanced
well
prost
lampertland
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
smoke
and
wood
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
smoke
and
cocoa
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
great
aromas
and
flavors
overall
i
was
looking
for
something
to
warm
me
up
after
the
bitter
cold
bike
ride
home
in
the
crushing
430
pm
darkness
of
pdx
and
i
think
i
found
it
this
thing
is
interesting
and
inviting
a
bit
sweet
but
that
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
a
bit
too
easy
maybe
given
the
10
i
will
definitely
seek
one
out
for
the
cellar
as
i
think
this
one
may
round
out
nicely
a
keeper
indeed
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
complex
flavor
however
i
was
expecting
a
bigger
mouthfeel
with
this
beer
this
is
one
intense
beer
with
almost
too
many
flavours
going
on
at
once
i
would
love
to
age
some
of
this
as
the
finishing
sweetness
was
a
little
much
right
now
but
the
beer
is
complex
and
full
of
deep
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
molasses
quite
a
beer
from
a
canadian
brewer
and
on
to
hold
onto
for
awhile

the

followed
by

midpalate
coffee
light

a
gentle

in

this
wellcrafted
strong
black
lager
shows
great
depth
and
complexity
of
flavour
great
length
and
exceptional
balance
of
sweet
bitter
and
even
tart
tastes
though
it
definitely
leans
closer
to
the
sweet
side
of
things
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
serve
it
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
basically
the
thing
that
sold
me
on
this
brew
was
the
extent
to
which
they
counterbalanced
the
impressively
complex
sweet
malt
profile
with
bitterness
roastedburnt
grains
hops
and
a
lager
yeast
finish
to
make
an
exceptionally
malty
beer
without
getting
too
cloying
great
job
tm
nice
mouthfeel
not
oily
but
mediumthick
sweet
finish
lasts
pretty
long
sweet
dark
dry
fruit
like
raisins
or
plums
molasses
vanilla
no
smoke
or
wood
maybe
just
a
hint
at
the
end
mostly
dark
fruit
very
pleasant
to
drink
overall
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
but
it
is
still
a
well
made
beer
there
is
lots
of
complex
interesting
flavor
and
the
booze
is
held
in
check
the
feel
is
pretty
big
as
well
which
really
helps
its
cause
this
would
be
good
in
small
servings
but
i
found
the
75cl
bottle
a
little
rough
going
at
it
alone
as
a
final
note
i
remember
the
09
being
much
different
than
this
2011
vintage
which
tells
me
this
is
a
good
candiate
for
a
vertical
one
day
cheers
to
the
guys
who
helped
me
out
with
this
one
pretty
top
notch
you
decide
if
its
in
the
top
three
for
the
style
though
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
true
pint
this
is
from
the
2011
vintage
the
beer
is
a
dark
auburnbrown
color
with
a
filmy
coating
of
light
brown
big
bubbled
head
dark
rich
nose
of
balsamic
vinegar
oakey
wood
characteristics
roasted
nut
and
a
slight
bitterness
the
body
is
creamy
and
rich
with
roasted
and
full
flavors
wood
and
earthy
notes
are
imparted
on
a
dark
nut
and
creamy
backbone
with
an
overall
roasted
quality
roasted
and
boozey
aftertaste
with
a
slick
finish
and
lingering
roasted
charcter
very
smooth
very
strong
and
very
good
really
a
treat
probably
the
best
baltic
porter
in
the
world
i
can
only
think
of
a
couple
of
beers
that
as
so
complex
beer
im
usually
going
to
seek
out
a
drier
beer
but
can
still
appreciate
a
an
fine
example
of
this
style
from
time
to
time
o
you
might
want
to
slowly
sip
this
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
but
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
which
is
unusual
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
good
flavor
and
good
mouthfeel

definitely
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
everfar
more

than
the
garrison
baltic
porter
a
fairly
fullbodied
beer
with
a
fine
and
unobtrusive
level
of
carbonation
slightly
warming
profound
and
contemplative
i
need
to
stop
fucking
around
and
buy
a
dozen
to
age
love
this
o
i
havent
had
a
baltic
porter
for
a
while
ill
be
having
a
few
more
after
this
its
a
cracking
brew
this
is
not
one
of
the
biggest
or
most
flavorful
baltic
porter
but
its
extremely
tasty
and
sweeter
in
the
taste
than
the
nose
suggests
overall
very
complex
sweet
smokey
woody
coffee
chocolate
almost
too
much
going
on
here
drinkability
is
moderate
wouldnt
be
able
to
handle
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
i
used
to
think
contemplative
was
a
bad
word
to
describe
a
drink
but
not
with
this
beer
seek
it
out
if
you
can
o
absolutely
delicious
i
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
in
the
cellar
highly
recommended
really
an
amazing
creation
this
the
creamy
sweetness
tart
overtones
and
roasty
oaky
smokey
goodness
is
over
the
top
for
me
its
a
sipper
for
sure
what
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
firm
cap
of

decent

imperial
baltic
porter
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
though
a
bit
of
age
could
bring
it
into
a
class
of
its
own
my
other
bottle
ill
sit
on
that
bad
boy
for
at
least
a
year
this
beast
could
take
it
o
a
lot
of
times
a
big
porter
is
just
a
stout
this
is
noticeably
different
the
roasted
malt
isnt
as
dominant
as
you
would
find
on
a
10
stout
instead
the
fruitiness
is
a
little
more
apparent
making
it
lighter
than
it
really
is
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
perhaps
dethroning
my
previous
favorite
smuttynose
baltic
porter
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
definitely
hope
to
get
a
second
there
is
surprisingly
little
nose
to
it
which
i
found
disappointing
thats
one
of
my
favorite
parts
of
a
good
beer
but
the
taste
it
had
so
much
flavor
it
was
like
an
amazing
meal
i
felt
like
i
was
dining
in
moscow
with
some
of
my
best
buddies
it
was
blissful
and
transporting
ive
had
good
portersstouts
and
this
one
ranks
up
in
the
very
highest
tier
d
wow
wonderfully
complex
and
yet
a
relatively
easy
drinker
even
with
an
abv
of
10
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
long
time
style
defining
simply
phenomenal
seek
it
out
now
edit
the
so
says
that
it
wasnt
a
random
choice
she
picked
it
because
its
the
wba
best
baltic
porter
which
just
goes
to
show
that
the
wba
knows
what
theyre
talking
about
man
bottle
was
10
bucks
at
the
lcbo
and
limited
quantities
saw
it
mostly
sell
out
before
christmas
2011
o
very
nice
taste
and
mouthfeel
in
this
baltic
porter
if
i
lived
closer
to
quebec
i
would
drink
one
more
regularly
overall
really
nice
beer
here
roasty
and
delicious
do
exceptionally
pleasant
to
drink
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
porter
with
a
bold
complex
and
very
enjoyable
palate
o
one
word
awesome
overall
a
great
beer
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
pretty
good
baltic
porter
i
usually
like
a
touch
more
body
and
some
more
smoothness
but
still
solid
overall
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
the
appearance
wasnt
great
and
the
taste
and
smell
were
just
slightly
above
average
the
main
highlight
is
probably
how
well
of
a
job
it
does
hiding
the
10
alcohol
level
maybe
a
little
age
would
have
helped
this
bottle
its
still
good
and
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
you
should
check
it
out
i
just
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
an
excellent
brew
that
held
up
well
at
the
head
of
a
long
tasting
session
d
for
10
abv
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
d
im
enjoying
the
combination
of
these
tastes
malty
sweet
toffee
dark
fruits
against
the
earthy
damp
wood
and
smoke
qualities
will
be
stocking
up
on
this
before
its
gone
overall
i
like
it
i
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
roastiness
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
this
is
damn
good
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
porter
sweet
at
cellar
temperature
format
and
price
is
my
least
favourite
part
of
this
beer
and
will
probably
limit
my
purchases
o
delicious
stuff
and
quite
drinkable
a
750ml
bottle
makes
for
a
good
friend
on
a
late
october
evening
o
havent
had
too
many
of
this
style
and
this
is
a
highly
rated
beer
but
the
beer
i
had
was
fundamentally
flawed
as
i
said
a
grave
disappointment
o
had
a
tough
time
finishing
this
one
as
it
warmed
to
room
temperature
as
the
sweetness
and
richness
of
the
malt
got
to
me
very
good
beer
though
watch
out
for
the
10
abv
pop
was
totally
proper
no
overflow
even
though
the
cork
was
just
barely
in
there
its
hot
out
but
this
was
smoother
than
silk
nose
of
a
perfect
balance
of
forest
fruit
and
chocolate
and
straight
up
mesquite
smoke
this
made
me
think
of
poland
the
łodzki
warmanski
and
ciechan
22
but
this
is
aged
to
perfection
feel
is
mineral
but
viscus
anise
texture
hints
of
acidity
leather
salt
wet
saddle
and
undertonics
of
smoke
and
balsamic
vinegar
lots
of
anise
chalk
dark
fruit
tannin
sticky
great
great
great
beer
wonder
if
its
lager
or
ale
yeast
if
you
dont
already
know
this
is
what
a
baltic
porter
is
im
not
sure
what
business
this
young
small
frenchcanadian
brewery
has
in
showing
up
some
of
eastern
europes
most
established
vested
brands
but
theyve
done
it
this
is
a
if
not
the
definitive
example
of
a
very
complex
historic
hard
to
brew
style
of
lager
merci
beaucoup
peensteen
again
a
great
and
mighty
shout
out
goes
to
flipper2gv
for
working
with
me
on
this
swap
d
almost
too
drinkable
at
9
2
its
hard
to
notice
the
alcohol
there
is
some
boozy
sharpness
to
it
but
its
not
abrasive
or
coarse
incredibly
easy
drinking
good
follow
through
as
well
2010
version
pours
a
dark
black
with
just
a
little
bit
of
caramal
brown
foam
tastes
very
roasty
almost
like
a
roasted
nut
type
of
taste
in
there
nice
notes
of
chocolate
as
well
this
bottle
said
it
was
9
2
alc
and
i
call
bullshit
this
was
insanely
easy
to
drink
by
far
the
smoothest
porter
i
have
had
to
date
really
sad
to
see
this
bottle
go
yeah
the
mild
finish
is
a
surprise
but
a
pleasant
one
and
it
in
fact
excels
to
become
the
key
selling
point
here
very
very
good
beer
this
one
trois
mousquetaires
continues
to
impress
me
and
this
indeed
is
them
at
the
top
of
their
game
a
decent
baltic
porter
and
really
quite
tasty
thick
full
flavoured
and
interesting
it
is
a
touch
sweet
but
that
is
good
in
its
own
way
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
heads
that
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
thin
ring
aroma
of
chocolate
smoke
and
ash
strong
malty
flavor
with
rich
dark
chocolate
some
dark
fruits
and
bitter
coffee
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
very
nice
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
this
brew
pours
a
dark
as
night
cola
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
mocha
laced
two
finger
head
that
slowly
reforms
to
a
nice
rim
and
little
lacingthe
smell
is
pretty
much
what
it
says
on
the
back
of
the
label
its
mostly
aromas
of
chocolate
and
alcohol
with
some
tobaccooak
and
port
in
there
aswellit
has
a
nice
smoothmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
leaves
your
lips
sticky
with
mocha
hints
and
coats
your
mouth
with
tastes
of
dark
cherry
ripebrandy
liqueor
encased
in
dark
rich
chocolatedark
berries
and
finishes
with
a
nice
strong
port
warmness
that
almost
feels
like
you
have
just
had
a
shot
of
some
dark
liquor
and
to
be
honest
overall
this
brew
is
very
interesting
with
alot
of
twists
and
turns
in
smell
and
taste
but
its
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
but
glad
ive
sampled
as
its
different
and
as
this
drop
is
my
last
for
the
night
its
the
perfect
nightcap
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
only
the
high
alcohol
stops
this
from
being
perfect
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
in
the
winter
absolutely
delicious
stuff
here
pours
almost
jet
black
with
12
of
tan
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
before
retreating
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
almost
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
pine
nutnutty
mocha
and
a
lingering
alcohol
on
the
palate
there
is
coffee
a
bittersweet
chocolate
presence
a
woody
presence
almost
like
oak
a
firm
bitterness
and
a
mild
alcohol
finish
medium
to
thin
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
pleasant
perfectly
carbonated
and
as
a
result
is
very
smooth
great
slow
sipper
definitely
a
bottle
to
split
good
stuff
here
its
delicious
and
easy
drinking
and
another
stellar
beer
from
les
trois
mousquetaires
ive
yet
to
have
anything
from
them
that
wasnt
outstanding
not
the
best
looking
brew
on
the
block
but
this
brew
scored
big
points
where
it
counts
the
flavor
department
lots
of
tasting
notes
to
keep
even
the
most
discerning
beergeek
busy
ive
been
very
happy
with
ltm
so
far
and
their
baltic
porter
while
not
the
blowyouaway
brew
beer
i
was
expecting
was
certainly
a
quality
flavorful
brew
well
worth
a
pick
up
if
you
can
find
it
ws
good
golly
miss
molly
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
it
is
all
about
malt
flavours
here
and
they
are
most
impressive
the
interplay
between
the
fruit
notes
and
chocolateroast
is
outstanding
ive
got
nothing
more
to
say
except
do
not
hesitate
to
pick
this
one
up
if
you
come
across
it
theres
no
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
or
smell
but
the
alcohol
sure
is
in
your
blood
d
completely
surprised
by
how
different
these
offering
were
yet
both
very
enjoyable
with
the
2009
being
so
sweet
and
the
2010
being
so
bitter
and
smoky
not
sure
how
much
difference
the
aging
process
made
maybe
well
have
to
grab
both
of
these
again
along
with
a
2011
next
year
d
i
was
super
excited
to
be
able
to
do
this
little
experiment
and
i
was
blown
away
by
the
differences
apart
for
the
appearance
these
two
vintages
produced
very
different
flavours
and
scents
much
like
a
fine
wine
this
one
will
not
disappoint
this
stuff
really
is
tasty
and
aging
does
appear
to
increase
the
sweetness
of
it
great
porter
and
highly
recommended
to
any
porter
fan
wow
a
big
beer
but
still
drinkable
and
approachable
has
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
interested
but
not
so
overwhelming
that
you
dont
want
to
check
it
off
and
walk
away
definitely
an
example
of
the
style
worth
revisiting
d
a
truly
remarkable

and

nonetheless
alcohol
is
much
an
afterthought
as
i
drank
it
i
was
reminded
of
why
i
chose
this
beer
in
the
first
place
the
beer
brought
a
party
of
classic
flavors
to
my
palate
it
opens
with
creamy
fudgelike
espresso
very
dry
yet
matly
sweet
the
whole
time
flowing
with
light
spice
rummy
alcohol
which
was
tamed
by
a
molasses
sweetness
lots
of
roast
across
my
cheeks
and
a
clean
bitter
finish
it
was
smooth
and
much
lighter
than
i
had
expected
from
a
beer
of
this
stature
but
all
the
flavors
are
so
well
balanced
it
makes
perfect
sense
the
combination
of
coffee
chocolate
cream
and
a
touch
of
black
liquorice
does
make
this
beer
among
my
favorite
porters
and
is
a
classic
in
my
mind
overall
a
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
was
a
little
cloying
which
made
it
hard
to
drink
d
thanks
again
zorprime
this

i
would

i
would
say
it
is
slightly
less
dark
than
the

just
hope
that
the

will
continue
to
make
beautiful
beers
like
this
one
again
and
again
these
guys
do
exceptional
lagers
even
at
this
weight
a
delicious
and
complex
beer
though
extremely
sweet
i
get
the
feeling
this
one
is
going
to
head
into
canadas

once
it
gets
enough
reviews
with
the
wider
distribution
that
3m
now
is
receiving
i
look
forward
to
the
rightful
acclaim
that
their
special

will
get
and
deserve
this
one
is
quite
nice
and
makes
me
look
forward
to
the
dopplebock
in
the
cellar
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
as
awesome
as
the
other
few
reviews
led
me
to
believe
still
a
few
of
us
killed
the
750ml
bottle
pretty
quick
id
drink
this
one
again
edit
im
drinking
the
2009
vintage
today
jan
13
2014
and
its
standing
the
test
of
time
with
no
problems
well
worth
the
wait
and
i
think
this
could
stand
up
to
another
couple
years
of
age
without
diminishing
my
early
reviews
with
high
scores
wouldnt
get
the
same
marks
from
me
today
today
this
ones
an
exception
overall
one
of
the
best
brews
i
had
the
pleasure
to
taste

come

well
very

but
not
cloying
pretty
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
mouthfel
is
smooth
and
not
quite
heavy
does
a
really
good
job
of
being
a
big
beer
without
being
a
mess
of
harsh
flavours
pours
black
with
dark

taste
is

a
little

solid
porter
with
above
average
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
apparent
drinkable
stuff
though
not
exceptional
baltic
porter
more
mal
than
any
coffee
or
chocolate
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
not
your
american
style
baltic
imperial
porter
possibly
more
true
to
the
classic
style
other
than
the
abv
id
definitely
drink
it
again
poured
an
hazy
dark

color
with
an

with

medium

spicy

with

overall
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
say
here
this
was
an
extra
something
i
had
never
heard
of
and
it
ended
up
being
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
the
last
year
at
least
i
need
to
see
if
more
of
this
is
around
as
really
i
was
blown
away
by
this

of

through

is
a

between
some
black

a
seriously
dry
ending
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
apparent
with
some
vinous
notes
without
being
cloying
i
am
not
exactly
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer

different
and
not
totally
on
style
but
still
interesting
nonetheless

overall
this
has
a
great
whiskey
flavor
the
grain
character
of
the
whiskey
actually
comes
through
really
nicely
o
outstanding
beer
first
second
impression
confirmed
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
really
nothing
special
in
my
mouth
glad
i
got
that
one
nailed
down
over
all
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
around
a
darn
impressive
beer
the
first
barrelaged
baltic
porter
ive
had
but
it
far
surpasses
many
barrelaged
imperial
stouts
smooth
rich
and
flavorful
with
great
barrel
integration
yum
o
overall
really
tasty
almost
tastes
like
half
whiskey
half
baltic
porter
lighter
to
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
light
level
of
carbonation
as
preiously
stated
this
beer
is
pretty
darn
good
with
nothing
bad
or
off
about
it
except
for
the
unreasonably
high
price
in
my
opinion
my
only
gripe
is
that
this
beers
character
is
totally
dominated
by
the
barrel
presence
and
doesnt
leave
much
room
for
the
beers
base
to
come
through
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
but
not
at
70
a
growler
o
i
really
loved
this
one
as
some
of
the
other
reviews
have
said
it
kind
of
smells
and
tastes
like
bourbon
county
it
has
everything
i
love
in
a
bourbon
barrel
stout
and
yet
it
remains
quite
drinkable
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
in
the
future
o
this
is
an
excellent
big
bourbon
stout
unsurprisingly
barley
johns
has
another
peerless
beer
in
their
line
up
the
only
downside
is
the
price
at
over
9
dollars
for
a
small
tulip
was
worth
it
though
thanks
for
the
hook
up
on
the
growler
mike
on
tap
at
the
great
taste
of
the
midwest
pitch
black
pour
with
a
small
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
awesome
aroma
of
bourbon
vanilla
oak
and
more
amazing
flavor
of
wood
chocolate
coconut
and
lingering
roast
coffee
awesome
flavors
and
perfect
balance
stellar
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
amour
of
tan
carbonation
smells
is
dripping
with
bourbon
and
chocolate
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
light
carbonation
smooth
with
a
little
dark
fruit
in
the
mix
really
good
thanks
liquor
barrel
o
this
is
a
good
beer
i
assume
it
lost
some
carb
in
the
growler
overall
a
bit
boozy
in
the
flavor
but
still
excellent
stuff
i
dont
understand
why
this
is
so
expensive
dark
knight
just
gets
better
and
better
as
i
go
through
the
glass
but
there
could
be
more
balance
and
a
better
show
of
porter
flavors
tone
back
the
bourbon
just
a
bit
and
were
in
business
looks
dark
with
a
very
light
dark
brown
head
the
nose
is
big
roast
and
bourbon
cocoa
chocolate
oak
yum
smells
really
good
the
taste
is
huge
roasty
malts
sweet
bourbon
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
booze
really
big
beer
that
is
somehow
only
slightly
boozy
in
spite
of
its
obvious
size
impressively
put
together
creamy
and
smooth
lower
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
that
is
unfortunately
is
a
hard
one
to
get
not
perfect
but
very
enjoyable
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
this
is
one
big
brew
after
five
ounces
i
was
feeling
it
according
to
the
bartender
this
could
weigh
in
anywhere
from
13
abv
and
up
i
believe
it
a
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
not
worth
the
70
a
growler
price
tag
in
my
opinion
that
is
unless
you
can
split
it
up
amongst
several
friends
believe
me
you
will
need
to
share
this
high
octane
beast
o
overall
this
is
a
great
barrel
aged
porter
there
is
some
definite
heat
to
it
but
the
nose
is
fantastic
would
certainly
love
to
have
this
one
again
some
day
had
several
pours
of
a
growler
shared
by
brad
again
fantastic
stuff
would
love
to
have
this
again
viscous
body
with
lots
of
boozy
heat
and
bourbon
flavor
way
too
hot
with
lots
of
burning
alcohol
that
overpowers
the
other
flavors
and
tons
of
warmthburning
in
the
finish
underneath
the
strong
barrelspirit
presence
there
is
some
chocolate
toffee
and
toast
way
too
much
bourbon
and
alcohol
sweetness
resulting
in
a
one
dimensional
beer
that
isnt
very
interesting
thick
and
viscous
mouthfeel
helps
things
a
bit
but
there
is
no
depth
or
complexity
o
good
beer
it
was
a
bit
much
at
times
and
can
really
only
do
it
in
small
doses
but
i
liked
it
and
as
far
as
imperial
ba
porters
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
o
a
powerful
bourbon
filled
sipper
that
i
enjoyed
and
would
have
no
problem
drinking
again
thanks
again
jeff
o
this
one
lived
up
to
expectations
for
me
just
an
awesome
beer
tried
on
tap
on
three
occasions
almost
black
appearance
with
a
small
brown
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
the
smell
on
this
beer
is
absolutely
stunning
with
sweet
bourbon
notes
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
could
drink
lots
of
this
on
a
nice
winter
evening
the
alcohol
and
bourbon
flavor
are
very
well
integrated
into
the
finished
product
i
think
the
porter
and
bourbon
barrel
combo
work
really
well
together
and
i
havent
seen
a
better
one
done
than
this
one
o
very
hot
and
needs
some
more
time
before
really
hitting
its
prime
in
terms
of
taste
it
would
be
nice
to
age
this
one
for
a
while
but
its
hard
to
do
considering
the
vessel
and
how
fast
it
goes
good
but
not
outstanding
overall
a
massive
beer
alcohol
is
not
soo
upfront
as
you
can
just
feel
this
one
ripping
you
apart
one
of
the
biggest
things
i
have
had
in
a
while
pours
nearly
black
with
a
small
mocha
head
that
lasts
for
a
bit
few
legs
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
a
spot
or
two
of
lacing
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
malt
and
bourbon
with
some
good
notes
of
roast
and
brown
sugar
some
vanilla
and
oak
go
with
the
bourbon
dark
fruits
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
a
really
incredible
bourbon
presence
with
some
dark
fruits
backing
things
up
nice
oak
roasted
malt
is
nice
and
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
moderate
sweetness
on
a
full
body
with
a
creamy
texture
really
solid
and
well
done
it
was
worth
the
wait
thanks
again
tony
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
really
sweet
on
the
lead
off
immediately
gives
way
to
the
liquor
character
of
the
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
truly
incredible
this
would
have
been
the
star
of
any
other
tasting
or
night
except
for
some
of
the
ridiculous
shit
we
had
next
to
it
i
would
have
this
again
in
a
second
jet
black
pour
with
a
reddish
head
they
pour
it
with
very
little
head
to
get
the
maximum
amount
of
beer
in
the
glass
the
head
was
about
a
14
inch
big
bourbon
on
the
nose
it
demands
center
stage
of
the
smell
fig
and
dark
fruit
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
are
faint
but
there
very
little
carbonation
i
was
expecting
as
much
bourbon
in
the
mouth
as
well
there
is
a
slight
burn
but
not
off
putting
this
beer
is
15
folks
its
bound
to
be
there
but
the
taste
is
so
damn
good
ive
noticed
certain
bourbon
barrel
beers
taste
like
roasted
coconut
to
me
this
one
does
as
well
bourbon
roasted
coconut
char
and
some
bakers
chocolate
heavenly
glad
i
finally
had
this
and
i
hope
the
people
i
sent
the
growlers
to
enjoy
it
equally
as
much
dark
knight
returns
smoother
than
the
dark
knight
with
similar
taste
profile
but
the
differences
is
the
barrel
aging
makes
a
world
of
difference
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
ever
tried
the
dark
knight
is
worth
the
hype
glad
i
tried
it
a
very
good
bourbon
bomb
served
in
a
small
chalice
with
one
finger
of
head
that
held
on
for
a
little
while
just
light
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
bourbon
vanilla
oak
and
alcohol
the
effects
of
the
bourbon
barrel
dominate
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
flavor
consists
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
overall
it
is
quite
sweet
and
hot
the
body
is
not
as
large
as
i
would
of
liked
with
this
type
of
flavor
profile
gentle
carbonation
and
soft
texture
this
is
a
beer
for
bourbon
lovers
bottle
shared
with
sparky27
never
thought
id
get
a
chance
to
try
this
thanks
eric
this
one
packs
a
mike
tysonlike
uppercut
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
if
you
arent
paying
attention
not
a
sliver
of
light
is
able
to
escape
this
blackhole
colored
beer
a
diminutive
burnt
caramel
head
builds
but
quickly
recedes
aroma
is
brown
sugar
heavy
bourbon
dark
fruit
molasses
and
vanilla
heavily
charred
oak
bitter
chocolate
and
aggressive
bourbon
flavor
warms
the
belly
and
numbs
the
mind
a
truly
great
beer
if
you
find
yourself
in
mn
go
out
and
get
yourself
a
taste
of
this
one
of
the
finest
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
have
had
right
up
there
with
bcs
kbs
backwoods
bastard
but
be
warned
this
one
is
hot
o
solid
brew
big
big
beer
the
bourbon
really
takes
over
this
beer
would
like
it
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
but
overall
was
worth
the
price
for
the
small
pour
harsh
at
times
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
every
element
of
this
monster
is
tainted
by
booze
and
its
working
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
the
thinnest
and
most
dry
barrel
aged
dark
beer
that
i
have
had
and
i
am
liking
it
recommended
overall
a
really
nice
beer
the
barrels
show
nicely
i
can
see
some
people
being
overwhelmed
by
the
bourbon
and
the
abv
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
bourbon
flavors
are
delicious
it
is
very
drinkable
but
i
am
trying
hard
to
make
my
small
glass
last
od
a
bit
heavy
on
the
booze
it
didnt
bother
me
as
i
love
bourbon
but
i
feel
like
it
probably
did
mask
some
of
the
other
characteristics
i
would
think
that
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
and
this
would
be
outstanding
o
i
loved
this
last
year
and
am
happy
to
have
it
again
the
nose
is
spectacular
and
richness
on
the
taste
is
close
behind
id
love
to
cellar
one
of
these
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
happens
another
great
beer
from
barley
johns
d
what
a
beer
nine
times
out
of
ten
i
would
prefer
the
bourbon
notes
to
be
more
restrained
than
they
are
in
this
one
but
for
some
reason
i
think
this
one
manages
to
pull
such
a
bold
character
of
although
the
beer
is
completely
dominated
by
bourbon
its
still
rather
complex
wouldnt
dare
to
call
it
balanced
though
its
also
important
to
note
that
you
can
really
tell
that
its
an
imperial
porter
rather
than
an
imperial
stout
it
doesnt
have
the
big
body
nor
the
massive
roasted
malt
character
of
an
imperial
stout
and
i
think
this
plays
an
important
part
in
the
success
of
the
beer
since
a
bigger
body
stickier
texture
and
bigger
roasted
flavors
would
probably
be
to
much
with
all
the
bourbon
with
the
porter
backbone
it
actually
manages
to
come
out
as
almost
easy
to
drink
overall
im
sad
that
this
wasnt
better
i
had
such
high
hopes
i
sat
on
the
patio
outside
barley
johns
on
perhaps
the
nicest
day
of
the
year
in
mn
so
far
sipping
on
this
delicious
brew
while
unwinding
from
a
days
work
and
enjoying
the
sunset
not
a
bad
way
to
spend
a
late
monday
afternoon
at
all
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
very
complex
with
a
lot
of
bourbon
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
this
is
a
great
beer
for
most
people
the
6oz
serving
is
probably
sufficient
but
for
bourbonlovers
this
is
a
musttry
this
one
is
special
but
isnt
for
everyone
big
props
to
todd1
for
hooking
up
some
thirsty
south
carolina
beer
geeks
d
its
a
sipper
not
doubt
but
its
wonderful
just
remember
to
let
it
warm
up
they
tend
to
serve
it
a
touch
cold
enjoyed
ontap
at
the
brewpub
this
is
a
refermented
dark
knight
and
uses
250
bourbon
bottles
casks
wine
colour
virtually
no

aboveaverage
mouthfeel
complex
bourbon
lavours
a
bit
of
oak
a
sipper
great
aroma
from
the
quality
bourbon
served
too
coldso
much
better
as
it
warmed
its
not
possible
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
its
so
overwhelming
i
daresay
that
the
only
thing
i
can
compare
the
drinkability
to
is
mikkeller
black
i
wish
i
was
able
to
have
more
and
fresh
so
that
i
could
have
a
proper
impression
of
what
the
drinkability
was
supposed
to
be
as
it
is
this
is
a
headache
in
a
bottle
so
boozy
sweet
bourbony
and
oaky
that
its
impossible
to
judge
this
along
the
lines
of
most
beers
i
can
say
that
its
excellent
overall
this
was
a
nice
treat
id
love
to
see
bottled
a
good
brew
but
a
bit
too
hot
for
my
full
enjoyment
ordered
it
with
an
ipa
so
it
could
warm
up
a
little
and
i
could
sip
it
from
time
to
time
nice
black
pour
but
no
head
to
speak
of
but
it
did
leave
a
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
dark
malts
wiskey
and
oak
at
first
the
taste
is
malty
i
get
a
real
nice
chocolate
flavor
mixed
with
the
whiskey
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
smooth
feel
going
down
and
warming
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
would
go
nicely
on
a
cool
night
out
on
my
deck
or
by
the
fire
at
bj
this
may
have
just
been
too
big
of
a
beer
for
me
but
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
appearance
is
good
very
black
and
thick
a
bit
of
tan
head
and
no
real
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
very
similar
a
lot
of
alcohol
comes
through
right
away
with
a
bit
of
coffee
malt
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
and
thick
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
that
great
largely
due
to
the
overwhelming
alcohol
content
d
somehow
really
drinkable
the
smell
scares
you
but
once
you
dive
in
it
is
a
really
nice
treat
awesome
beer
with
an
awesome
name
if
you
have
an
opportunity
try
this
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
bjs
in
may
while
visiting
a
friend
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
in
for
it
was
served
in
a
small
glass
maybe
8
oz
or
so
and
was
as
dark
as
dark
could
be
smelled
great
and
looked
the
part
what
i
couldnt
get
past
was
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
seemed
a
lot
more
than
the
advertised
13
5
i
have
had
beer
with
high
abvs
but
the
bartender
may
as
well
have
put
a
shot
of
bourbon
in
this
one
apparently
some
people
rave
about
it
so
its
worth
a
try
dgreatbut
you
better
like
your
bourbon
son
this
brew
is
so
big
that
it
could
put
a
halt
on
drinking
too
many
of
them
a
true
sipper
thru
and
thru
pours
black
with
a
small
dark
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
aroma
hits
immediately
after
pouring
huge
sweet
maltiness
dark
fruits
leather
and
wood
a
strong
bourbony
alcohol
singes
the
nose
taste
follows
with
a
rich
sweet
maltiness
strong
vanilla
notes
dark
berry
fruitiness
strong
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
is
very
large
but
on
par
for
the
size
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
low
in
carbonation
but
the
carbonation
that
is
there
is
creamy
and
adds
to
the
fullness
on
the
tongue
a
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
alcohol
at
the
back
of
the
throat
before
it
warms
into
the
somewhat
dry
finish
great
beer
the
barrel
ageing
comes
thru
very
well
and
though
the
alcohol
is
quite
present
it
fits
the
size
put
this
in
a
bottle
and
watch
me
go
broke
thank
you
to
eben
fantastic
really
gives
the
other
heavy
hitters
a
run
for
their
money
even
though
a
baltic
porter
would
stand
up
well
in
a
ris
tasting
i
had
the
fortune
of
trying
this
the
day
after
drinking
goose
islands
bourbon
county
stout
which
provided
a
nice
comparison
for
another
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
the
dark
knight
is
heavier
on
the
booze
with
the
alcohol
present
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
while
bourbon
dominates
the
flavors
in
the
taste
a
little
cocoa
and
coffee
back
up
the
liquor
but
i
think
the
bcs
is
much
more
balanced
by
comparison
this
is
still
a
great
beer
and
a
wonderful
sipper
but
id
recommend
the
dark
knight
returns
which
has
a
great
deal
less
bourbon
over
the
original
very
boozy
and
warming
good
amount
of
oak
character
but
not
quite
overdone
very
sweet
almost
cloying
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
for
such
a
beast
nicy
roasty
component
some
fruit
as
it
warms
ends
up
pretty
nice
huge
amounts
of
residual
sugar
in
this
brew
slightly
cloying
and
sticky
very
oily
viscous
mouthfeel
just
as
it
poured
in
the
glass
only
a
thimble
of
carbonation
not
sure
if
this
is
a
culprit
of
the
hand
bottle
very
sweet
concentrated
vanilla
flavors
bourbony
with
a
stomach
turning
type
alcohol
or
it
could
be
from
the
overly
sweet
elixir
however
the
beer
is
very
good
and
desserty
dark
chocolatey
ver
dark

creme
freche
thin
and

and
too

to

of
i
had
this
on

at

and
again
at
the
autumn
brew
review
very
darkblack
in

overpowering
bourbon
and
oakish
aroma
with
some
dark
fruit
as
well
slightly
sweet
prune
or

with
a

and
the
alcohol
is
noticable
a

treat
for

of

porter
with

aroma
of

quite
overpowering
with
some

notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
overpowered
by
bourbon

i
had
a
hard
time
pickingup
other
flavour
body
is
quite
full
with
alcohol
from
the
barrel
really
coming
out
i
was
a
bit
surprised
as
i
was
not
expecting
so
much
bourbon
to
come
out
in
such
fashion
and
i
am
probably
not
the
biggest
bourbon
fan
around
its
nice
when
you
get
a
whiff
of
a
highly
rated
beer
and
know
instantly
it
isnt
all
hype
rich

and
dark

blueberry
coffee
creamfudge
brownies
molasses
caramel
and
vanilla
the
chocolatefudge
and
coffee
elements
are
strongest
but
the
blueberry
fruity
notes
make
a
decent
showing
there
is
a
slightly
dusty
note
in
the
tail
end
of
the
aroma
quite
varied
and
concentrated
though
the
body
is
deep
black
and
holds
a
slowly
diminishing
thumb
thick
mocha
head
that
compresses
to
nickel
thickness
slightly
hot
boozy
notes
in
the
first
sip
followed
by
burntbitter
roast

coffee
notes
unsweetened
bakers

low
sweetness
dark

very
light

notes
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
very
portery
despite
the
massive
unporter
13
abv
which
youd
think
might
make
it
more
an
imperial
stout
in
thickness
the
finish
is
vanilla
sweet
cream
brown
sugar
and
some
more
dark
fruit
notes
this
time
lucious
grape
raisin
and
prune
doesnt
dissapoint
great
range
seems
to
dip
slightly
in
inteisity
through
the
middle
ranges
but
the
finish
is
very
enjoyable
and
it
drinks
damn
easy
for
a
13
abv
beer
mouthfeel
is
viscous
very
full
bodied
along
with
an
alcohol
boozy
burn
that
is
outweighed
by
the
delicious
flavors
and
stickiness
of
this
concoction
while
picking
up
a
growler
for
hopdog
figured
id
sample
this
fine
brew
myself
glad
i
did
too
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
thick
black
mess
of
liquid
and
massive
bubbles
and
head
lacing
all
over
the
place
loverly
the
nose
is
one
you
could
just
hook
up
to
your
nose
and
sniff
for
hours
on
end
roasted
malts
and
grains
thick
delicious
tastes
fantastic
richly
malty
slightest
hint
from
bourbon
oak
aging
wonderful
full
body
could
almost
call
it
thick
and
creamy
but
the
slightest
tingle
of
carbonation
quite
nice
now
i
have
to
ask
myself
why
am
i
not
buying
a
grolwer
for
myself
oh
ya
at
1
an
ounce
that
adds
up
and
it
aint
cheap
but
for
a
treat
every
blue
moon
there
is
nothing
better
oh
yeah
the
alcohol
while
wellhidden
is
very
warming
smells
of
tiramusu
cake
soaked
in
light
bourbon
covered
with
chocolate
sauce
and
decorated
with
toffee
cherries
and
coconut
flakes
with
a
side
of
sliced
apple
and
red
wine
near
opaque
black
color
initially
vinous
like
sweet
dark
fruits
and
red
wine
whichs
then
falls
into
a
roasty
blast
of
malt
with
chocolate
and
roast
grapes
and
bourbon
on
the
finish
with
light
vanilla
and
coconut
although
not
as
profound
as
i
usually
prefer
in
a
bourbon
beer
soft
texture
seemingly
better
when
served
at
the
brewpub
a
really
enjoyable
unique
beer
booyea
honestly
this
beer
may
be
a
bit
mature
for
me
its
nothing
like
ive
ever
tasted
before
and
as
time
goes
on
i
may
come
to
like
these
kinds
of
beers
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
if
only
to
expand
my
horizons
rosie
who
shared
a
hand
bottled
sample
poured
a
very
dark
black
color
with
a
small
brown
head
aromas
and
tastes
of
dark
fruits
plums
and
raisins
vanilla
apples
and
a
little
woody
and
smokey
sweet
molasses
a
lot
going
on
here
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
and
get
some
more
of
this
one
absolute
black
opaque
it
was
served
with
a
tiny
beige
head
the
retention
was
fair
as
it
faded
to
a
foamy
collar
sparse
in
the
middle
the
appearance
is
impressive
great
color
and
all
but
the
small
serving
glass
seems
to
up
the
ante
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
i
am
impressed
with
the
subsequent
lacing
it
was
spotty
but
fairly
widespread
the
nose
starts
off
with
jim
beamlike
aromas
with
hints
of
cheap
whiskey
possibly
old
crow
raw
alcohol
notes
as
well
actually
the
nose
seems
like
bourbon
soaked
mochachocolate
coffee
the
roasty
coffee
aromas
are
way
in
the
back
and
just
not
loud
enough
regardless
this
bouquet
is
still
very
inviting
the
potency
is
solid
the
palate
has
its
raw
moments
they
are
not
overwhelming
and
the
alcohol
flavors
add
plenty
of
depth
as
does
aging
this
beer
in
bourdon
barrels
i
get
a
lot
of
jim
beamlike
flavors
awesome
the
porter
aspects
are
too
secondary
and
mostly
hidden
the
chocolate
coffee
notes
are
too
weak
i
am
surprised
that
this
beer
is
not
very
sweet
and
it
is
actually
very
dry
quite
flavorful
the
finish
is
warm
and
alcoholic
bourbon
faint
hints
of
charred
wood
this
is
a
lovely
beer
something
to
sip
and
savor
i
am
impressed
at
how
easy
going
this
big
complex
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
ordinary
honestly
i
wish
it
were
chewier
it
is
a
little
fuller
than
medium
low
but
natural
carbonation
very
good
stuff
here
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
an
amazing
beer
one
that
would
start
a
riot
if
they
put
it
in
bottles
dark
and
opaque
thin
spidery
head
with
simple
string
lace
heavy
malts
mark
an
aroma
that
only
hints
at
whats
to
come
husky
carob
flavors
almost
chocolate
but
not
backed
by
a
dried
fig
fruitiness
impressive
mutating
flavors
switches
emphasis
to
a
more
highly
bittered
roastiness
on
later
sips
substantial
alcohol
is
decently
wellhidden
in
another
switch
by
the
end
of
the
glass
and
its
only
a
small
snifter
theres
a
distinct
sense
of
oreo
cookies
and
cream
with
some
spiced
pear
up
the
nasal
cavities
this
brew
is
quite
layered
and
impressive
taste
is
complex
rich
and
invigorating
with
a
ton
of
deep
dark
chocolate
some
molasses
fruitylike
alcohol
with
a
dark
earthy
quick
bite
of
woodyness
finding
some
hold
about
midway
finishing
with
more
complexing
woody
earth
features
of
sweet
malty
tang
and
bitterness
with
notes
of
flowery
spice
like
that
of
dulled
mustard
or
ginger
wow
the
bourbon
barrel
worked
its
wonders
on
this
brew
fantastic
very
portlike
in
its
character
packs
a
big
punch
in
flavor
and
alcohol
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
there
but
is
mildly
mellow
and
lends
the
feel
to
be
smoother
then
you
would
think
very
rich
nearly
full
overall
in
mouthfeel
with
a
welcoming
smoothness
that
makes
this
dark
knight
a
deadly
easy
drinkin
porter
super
yum
my
cuz
stubob
and
myself
swung
by
barley
johns
today
and
sampled
this
one
it
was
all
in
all
a
great
beer
we
had
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
talk
with
the
brewer
head
chef
and
owner
john
he
was
a
really
friendly
guy
who
was
happy
to
talk
about
his
beers
anyway
on
to
the
beer
this
one
came
in
a
little
snifter
it
was
as
black
as
midnight
with
a
brown
head
the
aroma
was
great
it
was
portlike
and
oaky
with
a
nice
roastiness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
my
anticipation
was
growing
the
taste
was
amazing
with
the
port
oakiness
coming
through
there
were
also
flavors
of
dark
fruits
such
as
figs
and
dates
after
talking
with
the
brewer
we
found
that
he
used
a
high
gravity
trappist
yeast
for
this
one
that
gave
it
the
estery
dark
fruit
flavors
it
also
had
a
nice
roastiness
to
it
all
in
all
it
was
a
high
octane
brew
one
to
be
sipped
but
it
was
still
easy
drinking
an
exceptional
brew
probably
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
ever
had
itd
be
nice
if
you
could
get
more
than
78
ounces
for
5
25
or
get
78
ounces
for
less
a
bit
spendy
indeed
overall
i
really
like
this
very
nice
smoke
and
chocolate
combination
black
brew
solid
tan
head
smells
of
smoky
malts
not
unlike
a
campfire
more
liquid
smoke
flavor
good
lager
base
is
not
overly
objectionable
mellower
than
other
smoky
beers
on
tap
thin
overly
smokey
dark
tastes
like
liquid
smoke
i
havent
had
smoke
in
several
years
but
this
is
far
better
than
i
remember
maybe
age
has
toned
it
down
or
maybe
my
memory
is
hazy
either
way
this
is
an
excellently
balanced
beer
still
hot
but
not
overly
smoky
like
a
number
of
similar
beers
out
there
excellent
base
baltic
porter
worth
a
try
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
tasty
dark
lager
and
would
definitely
have
again
extremely
subtle
use
of
the
smoked
malts
here
however
actually
had
me
wanting
for
more
intensity
i
mean
why
else
would
you
wax
the
bottle
for
those
who
may
have
shied
away
from
this
one
should
not
fear
the
smoke
smoke
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
lacing
tan
head
there
is
a
strong
smokey
aroma
much
like
a
smoked
meat
the
taste
has
a
nice
mellow
but
pronounced
smokey
flavor
very
meaty
flavors
the
body
feels
a
little
watery
but
a
nice
warmth
overall
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
smoking
beer
ooverall
quite
surprised
loved
the
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
o
great
smoked
porter
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
pleasure
of
smoke
flavor
in
their
food
or
drink
quite
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
darn
good
raucbier
it
really
hides
the
8
alcohol
which
could
be
dangerous
in
a
bomber
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
chance
beyond
the
first
sip
each
sip
has
been
better
than
the
last
deep
dark
cola
brown
pour
with
khaki
head
nose
is
a
nice
mix
of
salty
smoke
and
sweet
cherrytype
smoke
along
with
refined
roast
malt
cocoa
powder
and
faint
fruit
esters
flavor
is
a
gentle
saltysweet
smoke
mix
bittersweet
chocolate
soft
roasted
malt
and
some
mild
dark
fruit
lingering
bittersweet
chocolate
and
to
a
lesser
extent
charcoal
odi
wasnt
enamored
with
this
beer
over
the
top
smokiness
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
diversity
in
the
flavor
profile
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
to
low
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
45
somewhat
foamy
15
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
easy
to
sip
this
fairly
substantial
beer
as
it
should
be
ethanol
can
be
felt
as
a
light
burn
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
a
little
heat
in
the
nostrils
a
bit
disappointing
for
an
8
lager
beer
closes
dry
with
medium
to
mediumlight
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
a
great
smoked
beer
the
smoke
doesnt
dominate
and
gives
all
the
other
layers
a
chance
to
shine
surly
smoke
lager
45
judgement
absolutely
worth
a
try
and
if
smoked
porters
are
your
thing
pick
up
a
few
low
b
o
i
had
a
bad
experience
with
a
smoked
beer
from
a
macro
brew
so
i
came
in
skeptical
but
again
surly
shows
why
theyre
the
pride
of
minnesota
breweries
a
smoke
beer
that
can
be
completely
miss
handled
and
they
are
able
to
balance
the
smokiness
with
the
rich
flavors
of
raisen
fig
licorice
and
that
slight
molasses
sweetness
i
recommend
you
let
this
beer
begin
to
warm
before
you
are
really
able
to
enjoy
the
full
flavor
experience
of
this
beer
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
fairly
agressive
brown
head
roast
dark
chocolate
and
light
smoke
on
the
nose
really
balanced
beer
tastes
primarily
of
roasted
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
smoke
level
is
minimal
and
actually
helps
roundsweeten
the
beer
a
bit
the
base
is
very
well
made
and
has
the
exact
lager
mouthfeel
that
a
baltic
porter
should
final
thoughts
having
had
both
the
fresh
and
aged
version
of
smoke
its
hard
to
say
which
one
was
more
enjoyable
the
solution
would
be
to
buy
two
bottles
every
year
for
further
drinkinganalysis
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
ive
never
understood
how
this
beer
does
not
garner
the
same
reputation
as
surlys
other
seasonal
releases
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
though
it
is
one
i
only
wanted
a
bit
of
and
not
often
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
smaller
bottles
so
that
i
didnt
feel
like
i
wasted
so
much
of
something
that
had
such
a
complex
tone
to
it
overall
it
was
sippable
not
drinkable
smoke
was
a
beer
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
in
the
future
as
for
the
rest
of
the
bottle
it
just
got
used
to
make
some
beef
jerky
yep
i
said
it
stay
tuned
for
that
post
next
week
never
let
a
good
beer
go
to
waste
o
tasty
baltic
porter
for
sure
given
the
age
the
smokiness
is
not
bad
at
all
instead
of
being
at
the
forefront
its
more
of
a
complementary
flavor
adding
a
layer
of
complexity
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
ever
had
and
a
delicious
baltic
porter
to
begin
with
well
integrated
and
balanced
flavors
leads
to
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
smoke
after
having
a
few
smoked
beers
from
jester
king
lately
i
thought
it
would
be
something
like
that
a
light
colored
beer
id
compare
it
to
stones
smoked
porter
in
style
but
its
nothing
like
that
either
think
of
it
as
a
smoked
stout
almost
just
my
two
cents
im
not
sure
why
this
is
categorized
as
a
baltic
porter
instead
of
a
rauchbier
but
either
way
its
a
strange
but
ultimately
pretty
pleasant
and
very
interesting
offering
from
surly
smokiness
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
chocolate
and
maplemolasses
sweetness
im
glad
i
got
around
to
this
one
worth
trying
overall
a
good
smoked
porter
that
didnt
go
crazy
on
the
smoke
like
so
many
smoked
beers
do
i
appreciate
that
and
am
enjoying
this
beer
thanks
ryan
okay
hes
actually
a
great
guy
a
pretty
strong
brew
though
right
for
the
style
the
alcohol
imho
is
hidden
pretty
well
a
very
good
beer
o
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
just
not
a
very
mainstream
style
o
purely
awesome
if
you
love
smoked
beer
or
scotch
o
a
really
nice
beer
balances
the
smoky
and
sweet
flavors
which
are
tasty
and
complex
the
smoke
can
become
a
bit
strong
though
so
this
is
probably
a
beer
to
be
split
with
friends
oexcellent
smoked
beer
very
complex
and
a
delight
to
taste
yet
altogether
very
drinkable
and
balancedwould
gladly
have
another
dont
know
how
true
this
beer
is
to
the
baltic
porter
style
i
think
its
really
in
its
own
category
or
should
be
in
some
specialty
hybrid
category
of
smoked
beers
o
good
take
on
a
baltic
porter
wow
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
amber
when
held
up
to
light
almost
clear
large
tan
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
very
smokey
nice
chocolate
aroma
with
some
mellow
charcoal
and
burnt
malt
nice
smoked
meat
aroma
taste
is
coffee
at
first
then
the
smoke
comes
in
this
beer
tastes
like
a
more
rich
chocolatey
schlenkerla
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
great
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
especially
for
8
20
overall
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
ever
had
very
interesting
and
deep
flavor
boozy
and
feels
it
i
hold
surly
to
a
high
standard
and
this
didnt
disappoint
o
not
a
bad
porter
im
assuming
drinking
it
fresh
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
for
me
smoke
was
over
the
top
for
my
taste
o
good
smoke
beer
fairly
one
dimension
but
you
do
get
some
roast
chocolate
etc
from
the
porter
as
well
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
smoked
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
o
an
interesting
combo
of
lager
and
stout
an
allday
sipper
pairs
well
with
ghost
pepper
cheese
i
think
if
they
sold
this
in
4
pack
cans
that
would
be
awesome
thanks
elliott
a
very
nice
beer
that
made
elaines
homemade
pulled
pork
sandwiches
even
better
its
called
smoke
so
i
expected
that
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
especially
from
the
smell
a
woody
smoke
not
meaty
or
salty
want
more
porter
though
more
richness
or
more
sweetness
or
more
of
something
other
than
smoke
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
ill
feel
compelled
to
drink
all
that
often
overall
i
dont
remember
this
being
so
smoky
regardless
its
tasty
surly
crafts
some
aggressive
yet
drinkable
stuff
overall
an
extremely
unique
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
from
surly
but
it
definitely
showcases
their
creative
potential
o
3
5
overall
this
was
a
beer
that
grew
on
me
as
i
sipped
i
think
i
started
this
one
out
too
warm
and
the
smoke
flavors
were
a
bit
much
as
it
warmed
up
it
really
mellowed
out
and
everything
blended
together
todd
from
surly
really
knows
what
he
is
doing
and
keeps
putting
out
style
defying
and
expertly
crafted
beers
recommended
to
any
fan
of
dark
malty
beers
or
any
ba
looking
to
try
something
oneofakind
cheers
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
signficant
and
controlled
smokey
taste
with
the
porter
complexty
behind
it
great
smoked
although
not
as
bold
tasting
a
baltic
porter
as
i
would
expect
the
beer
is
really
a
cross
between
the
two
smoke
aroma
fortunately
the
taste
isnt
smokeforward
mildly
smokey
but
tons
of
roast
and
malt
are
at
the
forefront
thinish
body
still
works
given
the
lower
carbonation
i
really
like
this
o
a
tasty
beer
overall
with
an
odd
but
tasty
mix
of
flavors
and
aromas
really
enjoyable
and
super
smokey
nice
smokey
baltic
porter
big
flavor
and
powerful
body
this
is
one
terrific
beer
the
aromas
were
heavenly
and
this
was
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
a
very
good
effort
from
surly
the
beer
jet
black
with
big
notes
of
bacon
smoke
and
charcoal
it
would
be
excellent
with
bbq
for
a
baltic
porter
some
of
the
nuance
of
the
style
is
lost
in
the
smoke
but
its
still
super
smooth
and
drinkable
the
aftertaste
is
a
slightly
bitter
chocolate
very
drinkable
beer
but
something
is
slightly
off
in
the
follow
through
o
pretty
much
as
good
as
id
hoped
for
surly
brews
some
damn
terrific
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
ive
had
baltics
with
lots
of
sweetness
or
loads
of
spice
but
never
one
so
savory
and
ill
be
savoring
memories
of
this
for
a
while
its
complexities
and
subtleties
make
it
a
joy
to
sip
and
one
id
very
much
like
to
have
again
thanks
anthony
o
very
impressed
very
drinkable
no
sign
of
the
abv
at
all
perfect
level
of
smoke
overall
surly
makes
fantastic
dark
beers
surly
four
is
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
surly
smoke
is
not
far
behind
it
this
beer
is
also
probably
the
best
baltic
porter
and
the
best
smoked
beer
that
i
have
ever
drank
bravo
surly
you
guys
nailed
this
beer
o
im
always
a
little
leery
of
smoked
beers
and
the
smell
had
me
a
bit
concerned
that
this
would
be
one
dimensional
but
the
flavors
here
are
wonderful
and
balanced
excellent
brew
pours
black
in
color
with
a
small
chocolaty
head
nose
is
chcoloate
malts
enveloped
by
a
rich
smokiness
taste
is
true
to
the
nose
starts
off
with
a
nice
chocolate
malt
profile
that
ha
a
touch
of
grains
this
moves
into
a
deeper
richer
chocolate
flavor
that
is
really
nice
next
up
is
a
nice
touch
of
smokey
meatiness
more
smoke
than
meat
finishes
with
lingering
meats
mouth
is
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
solid
beer
takes
rauchbier
to
a
nice
level
as
the
smoke
is
in
the
background
not
the
forefront
complementing
rather
than
dominating
the
pallet
one
of
the
better
in
the
surly
lineup
imo
the
tingle
left
in
mouth
is
like
a
comforting
flannel
shirt
definitely
unique
o
pretty
good
could
have
gone
higher
as
i
liked
it
but
ill
stick
with
a
4
thanks
a
ton
aaron
overall
too
much
smoke
salt
and
meat
overall
though
this
is
really
delicious
if
they
somehow
get
the
novocaine
action
nixed
or
controlled
this
beer
would
be
a
serious
winner
very
different
and
unique
brew
and
the
beer
has
that
one
lacking
character
that
many
dont
have
its
just
flat
out
fun
o
i
like
it
it
only
took
three
years
to
get
a
bottle
after
a
little
bit
of
effort
but
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
not
overly
sweet
or
smokey
yet
all
the
promised
flavors
were
there
very
tasteful
definatly
one
of
my
favorite
baltic
porters
and
quite
possibly
my
favorite
smoked
beer
as
of
now
lots
of
in
your
face
smoke
which
i
really
enjoy
while
still
staying
somewhat
in
balance
gotta
give
it
to
surly
they
dont
know
how
to
make
a
bad
beer
o
im
a
big
baltic
porter
fan
so
ive
had
this
on
my
list
for
a
while
but
since
im
not
a
rauchbier
guy
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
i
think
this
brew
does
a
good
job
showcasing
smoked
malts
while
still
leaving
a
bit
of
flavor
to
be
discovered
not
sure
how
it
intense
it
is
fresh
but
at
a
little
over
a
year
it
seems
perfect
for
me
doverall
this
beer
was
good
me
and
my
friend
made
homemade
bacon
mugs
so
i
think
that
might
of
distracted
me
a
little
and
gave
the
beer
a
little
more
of
a
cured
meat
flavor
but
i
think
it
might
have
also
made
it
taste
a
little
better
but
in
my
notes
i
tried
to
taste
it
and
ignore
the
bacon
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
baltic
porter
had
just
enough
smokiness
but
didnt
overpower
it
def
give
this
a
try
if
you
can
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
right
away
if
i
saw
it
again
but
then
again
i
might
o
i
found
myself
wanting
more
but
again
i
was
subject
to
a
limited
supply
of
1
at
20
a
bomber
this
is
a
tad
pricey
and
although
it
was
tasty
and
memorable
i
would
reserve
it
for
special
occasions
a
dangerously
drinkable
and
full
flavoured
ale
indeed
o
tasty
smokey
porter

oanother
really
impressive
beer
by
surly
very
unique
and
delectable
as
far
as
smoked
beers
go
you
probably
cant
find
a
better
example
world
class
hands
down
this
is
the
best
rauchbier
ive
tried
the
flavors
are
flawlessly
integrated
smoke
roast
chocolate
bacon
and
oak
i
couldnt
think
of
a
better
beer
with
which
to
sit
around
the
campfire
on
a
cool
fall
evening
o
im
amazed
at
how
they
made
such
a
strong
smoky
aroma
but
a
milder
smoke
taste
delicious
o
this
is
a
good
one
to
open
with
a
group
definately
a
sipper
a
great
change
of
pace
from
what
i
gravitate
to
got
another
bottle
i
am
aging
and
may
pick
up
a
couple
more
to
rest
to
see
what
evolves
from
this
o
this
is
a
seriously
good
baltic
porter
if
you
love
smoky
beers
andor
you
love
bacon
this
beer
is
for
you
im
sincerely
impressed
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
bacony
the
last
time
i
had
it
ill
have
to
crack
a
2010
bottle
to
see
how
its
changed
o
a
good
smokey
beer
that
balances
the
smokeyness
with
the
other
flavors
worth
a
try
this
is
the
first
and
only
smoked
beer
ive
had
drinking
a
campfire
was
what
came
to
mind
immediately
smelled
like
a
campfire
i
thought
the
wife
would
smell
my
clothes
and
ask
where
i
was
after
i
drank
this
very
immersive
experience
that
made
me
want
to
go
out
and
make
some
smores
i
cant
say
i
was
crazy
about
the
taste
overall
but
man
the
great
smell
great
smooth
mouthfeel
really
made
it
a
nice
o
i
usually
avoid
surly
because
all
their
beers
are
incredibly
expensive
im
in
mn
and
usually
its
at
least
184pk
i
also
have
not
had
many
smoked
beers
but
this
brew
is
very
nicely
balanced
so
that
the
smoky
flavors
are
not
overpowering
it
works
very
well
considering
the
base
beer
is
a

porter

i
need
to
try
this
one
fresh
but
this
year
old
bottle
was
pretty
darn
tasty
it
was
just
so
smooth
an
a
grade
for
me
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
over
a
year
or
two
a
complex
beer
like
this
should
change
a
lot
overall
a
good
winter
beer
if
you
like
smoky
beers
with
a
big
smoke
flavor
this
is
the
beer
for
you
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
but
a
ton
of
smoke
and
malt
to
bring
big
flavor
with
every
sip
i
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
and
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
available
and
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
smoke
o
man
this
rounds
out
my
surly
box
from
my
minnesota
homeboy
olympuszymurgus
and
there
wasnt
a
mediocre
bottle
in
the
box
they
were
all
extremely
delicious
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
dont
know
if
you
are
supposed
to
age
a
baltic
and
i
dont
know
what
it
drinks
like
fresh
but
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
year
on
it
very
smooth
very
balanced
lots
of
flavors
mixing
in
and
blending
nicely
sweet
smooth
mild
smoke
a
little
dry
very
nice
maybe
im
warming
to
the
whole
smoke
beer
thing
but
this
one
is
really
nice
i
like
it
great
finish
i
would
have
this
again
o
a
really
nice
beer
worth
seeking
out
definitely
would
trade
for
another
bottle
or
two
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
12
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
smoked

and
maybe
some
caramel
and
cocoa
notes
taste
is
of
smoked
malt
up
front
with
some
dark
fruits
and
cocoa
powder
on
the
finish
a
smoky
roasted
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
smoked
baltic
porter
from
surly
the
smoke
aroma
is
somewhat
dominant
but
the
smoke
flavors
compliment
the
other
tastes
in
the
beer
very
well
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
with
a
well
rounded
base
of
flavoring
the
alcohol
is
perfectly
integrated
in
this
brew
which
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
the
finish
is
fairly
crisp
with
a
lingering
smoked
and
chocolate
aspect
a
very
fine
example
that
is
quite
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
bottles
of
this
i
dig
this
beer
and
am
thankful
for
the
opportunity
a
beer
thats
been
shared
on
multiple
occasions
and
often
with
non
beer
geeks
and
always
ends
up
a
crowd
favorite
not
an
easy
task
surly
so
well
played
procured
in
a
trade
but
cant
remember
from
who
750ml
capped
bottle
coated
with
silver
wax
served
in
my
allagash
chalice
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
half
inch
khakicolored
head
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
that
eventually
dissipates
into
a
soapy
skim
exceptional
nose
on
this
brew
smoky
dark
fruits
figs
and
dates
as
well
as
an
earthy
quality
and
grape
and
bubblegum
notes
taste
follows
nose
however
much
more
smokey
than
suggested
by
the
nose
chocolate
and
roast
are
also
revealed
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
consistency
perhaps
a
little
thin
for
the
style
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
texture
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
baltic
porters
not
only
is
it
delicious
but
there
is
great
complexity
to
this
brew
another
top
notch
offering
from
surly
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
i
wish
there
were
some
other
flavors
that
could
popped
up
but
the
smokiness
really
took
over
and
dominated
i
guess
thats
why
they
call
it
smoke
drink
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
can
handle
a
baltic
porter
but
this
was
a
bit
unbalanced
and
just
too
roasted
and
peat
like
o
winner
winner
bbq
diner
great
with
bbq
ribs
another
great
style
by
none
other
than
surly
o
weird
but
i
kinda
like
it
nice
baltic
and
smoked
beer
alike
drink
em
if
you
got
em
its
going
fast
o
from
what
ive
heard
this
is
better
fresh
so
im
a
little
bummed
that
ive
sat
on
this
for
so
long
oh
well
smoke
is
still
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
at
this
point
o
very
good
smoke
dominates
which
it
should
i
do
wish
the
porter
base
would
have
stood
out
a
bit
more
though
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
top
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
amazingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
are
bold
but
also
complex
its
not
a
one
sided
smoke
flavor
like
often
what
happens
with
porters
the
tastes
changes
and
matures
in
your
mouth
i
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
and
again
o
another
fantastic
beer
from
surly
ive
had
it
a
few
times
on
draft
and
in
bottles
and
this
bottle
from
the
first
2010
bottling
in
march
really
stood
out
wish
i
had
some
more
cheers
to
todd
and
omar
surly
smoke
is
a
oneofakind
beer
who
else
brews
a
smoked
porter
with
lager
yeast
the
end
result
is
brilliance
never
have
i
had
a
smoked
porter
with
such
a
smooth
mouthfeel
usually
the
smokey
malts
work
with
the
smoked
malts
to
give
a
super
smokey
smoked
smorgasboard
is
that
too
much
of
a
mouthful
yes
yet
surly
brillianltly
uses
the
subtle
workings
of
lager
yeast
to
mellow
out
the
overwhelming
smoked
malts
end
result
is
an
entirely
tooquaffable
brew
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
certainly
there
is
smoke
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
but
good
gosh
it
is
not
at
all
bitter
in
fact
there
is
a
light
sweetness
that
plays
nicely
against
the
smoke
kudos
to
surly
for
setting
my
new
standard
for
smoked
beer
had
the
2011
batch
fresh
and
im
really
impressed
with
it
more
balanced
love
the
woodoak
characteristics
that
come
out
roasted
malt
coffee
cocoa
do
not
age
this
beer
fresh
is
much
better
than
the
previous
bottle
i
had
which
was
aged
for
a
while
o
overall
this
beer
is
phenomenal
and
met
my
expectations
this
is
my
new
gold
standard
for
baltic
porters
would
love
to
have
it
again
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
many
beers
that
try
to
make
a
smoked
beer
are
afraid
of
blasting
the
other
flavors
out
surly
blasts
the
smoke
yet
also
puts
out
enough
other
flavors
to
help
compete
and
get
accentuated
in
good
ways
by
the
smoke
overall
a
very
good
porter
that
is
complex
and
very
tasty
the
smoke
is
tame
enough
to
notice
the
many
flavors
going
on
here
another
great
surly
brew
overall
i
really
like
this
been
craving
some
smoke
and
this
is
doing
the
job
surly
hits
another
one
out
of
the
park
for
me
d
fairly
drinkable
especially
considering
how
bold
the
flavors
are
but
that
is
just
how
smooth
it
is
the
smoke
flavor
is
really
strong
and
fits
right
in
with
the
beer
overall
this
is
my
first
offering
from
surly
and
i
cant
wait
to
explore
more
of
them
through
trades
and
beer
fests
smoke
gets
sweeter
as
it
goes
and
i
would
prefer
a
lasting
smokiness
as
it
warms
though
this
beer
does
a
fine
job
this
beer
was
well
worth
the
wait
and
i
am
so
glad
that
i
have
another
bottle
smoked
porters
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
please
surly
keep
doing
what
you
do
this
beer
is
smokey
but
not
overboard
with
some
wonderful
complexities
beneath
the
plume
of
smoke
o
great
beer
reminded
me
of
coffee
bender
if
it
was
smoked
though
very
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
by
the
bon
fire
would
drink
this
again
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
vry
thick
but
still
clear
on
the
edges
smells
potently
of
smoke
incredibly
smoky
wow
tastes
sweet
and
malty
off
the
get
go
tons
and
tons
of
smoke
on
the
back
vry
nicely
potent
not
so
much
that
its
unbearable
solid
mouthfeel
and
pretty
interesting
overall
ogood
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
good
breakfast
beer
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
smoked
baltic
porter
i
dont
think
smoked
beers
or
baltic
porters
in
general
blow
my
mind
but
this
is
a
very
good
one
great
mouthfeel
and
glad
i
have
anough
bottle
of
it
i
did
not
go
into
this
expecting
smoke
to
be
a
real
enjoyable
beer
since
im
not
a
huge
smoke
guy
i
left
wanting
more
bottles
in
my
opinion
just
about
the
perfect
smoked
beer
surly
amazes
me
again
i
want
to
move
to
mn
just
for
surly
you
guys
rock
o
pretty
delicious
smooth
and
totally
unique
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
another
bottle
to
put
away
for
longer
if
one
ever
gets
a
chance
to
try
the
mole
smoke
it
is
a
supreme
beer
which
i
also
highly
recommend
given
its
name
smoke
isnt
really
as
smoky
as
i
expected
still
its
got
some
very
nice
flavors
that
are
incredibly
wellintegrated
its
a
smooth
drink
for
sure
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
bit
of
a
sipper
too
ill
look
for
this
one
again
drink
is
decent
no
real
booze
effect
just
a
very
slight
hint
of
warming
booze
smooth
and
creamy
a
bit
dry
d
decent
stuff
i
enjoy
porters
quite
a
bit
but
this
one
was
just
too
smokey
to
really
enjoy
i
could
drink
one
of
these
but
that
is
about
it
sure
it
is
drinkable
but
i
have
had
many
better
smoked
offerings
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
the
hype
drinkability
the
smoke
does
not
dominate
which
i
appreciated
overall
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
do
not
tend
to
go
after
the
smoked
beers
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
smoke
is
a
beer
i
whould
love
to
grab
three
or
four
bottels
and
let
them
age
a
bit
and
see
what
happens
also
this
make
a
great
beer
to
add
to
my
special
occ
stach
with
no
alcohol
in
taste
there
is
a
slight
warming
effect
that
comes
from
smoke
slightly
chewy
with
a
big
edium
feel
and
ample
carb
thanks
for
the
bottle
ogl
this
one
was
a
treat
d
moderately
high
i
am
impressed
tasty
stuff
didnt
have
it
fresh
but
time
seemed
to
be
kind
to
it
my
first
special
release
surly
and
it
was
a
joy
to
drink
pretty
good
i
can
polish
off
one
of
the
750ml
bottles
in
a
sitting
and
be
pretty
happy
i
dont
know
if
id
be
likely
to
get
it
at
a
bar
but
i
really
like
it
as
kind
of
a
staying
in
for
the
night
kind
of
drink
d
this
is
a
really
cool
twist
on
this
style
the
smoke
blends
wonderfully
with
the
sweetness
and
the
slow
warming
in
the
belly
make
ya
feel
just
right
another
great
beer
from
what
look
more
and
more
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
baltic
porter
i
have
ever
had
the
smokiness
may
seem
like
a
gimmick
but
it
is
really
not
the
beer
is
genuinely
solid
pours
jet
black
with
but
not
completely
opaque
with
a
tan
head
that
disappears
over
time
smells
very
similar
to
chocolate
stouts
with
lots
of
chocolate
and
molasses
as
well
as
some
subtle
smoke
the
taste
is
of
more
chocolate
and
molasses
and
then
the
smoke
comes
similar
to
weyerbacher
fifteen
but
much
creamier
however
after
sipping
on
it
for
1015
minutes
the
smoked
bacon
taste
starts
to
take
over
a
bit
much
for
me
this
beer
is
so
creamy
and
delicious
but
starts
to
become
a
little
too
sweet
and
smokey
for
my
liking
i
really
loved
it
at
first
and
by
the
end
i
had
grown
tired
of
it
still
a
great
and
different
beer
that
i
would
recommend
trying
d
excellent
drinkability
especially
for
style
too
often
the
smokeeven
if
not
overpowering
at
firsteventually
becomes
too
much
not
so
here
an
excellent
representation
of
a
rauchbier
drinks
more
like
this
than
a
baltic
porter
the
8
2
abv
is
imperceptible
magic
surly
strikes
again
overall
what
a
great
presentation
with
the
red
wax
on
the
bottle
cool
graphics
on
the
bottle
as
well
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
think
i
found
a
brewery
whose
beers
ill
be
be
making
a
serious
effort
to
search
out
i
havent
been
all
that
impressed
by
smoke
the
2
times
i
have
had
it
on
tap
while
drinking
other
beers
but
this
bottle
really
surprised
me
smooth
tasty
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
body
is
a
little
thinnish
with
the
carbonation
coming
on
a
little
strong
up
front
and
finishing
too
light
the
roasted
smoky
notes
linger
too
long
for
the
next
drinkability
score
thanks
to
the
sis
for
this
birthday
present
looking
forward
to
next
years

im
glad
to
have
had
this
opportunity
to
taste
smoke
thanks
feloniousmonk
even
if
its
clearly
not
the
beer
that
it
once
was
i
would
be
even
more
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
taste
it
fresh
and
ontap
heres
hoping
that
wish
comes
true
sometime
in
the
next
several
years
d
despite
being
pretty
smokey
i
actually
thought
this
was
good
and
had
enough
other
flavors
going
on
big
thanks
to
largadeer
for
sharing
this
one
after
the
bruery
rs
postparty
served
from
bottle
into
a
bruery
sampler
imperial
pint
poured
pitch
black
with
a
very
minimal
slight
tan
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
and
smoke
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
smoke
caramel
and
chipotle
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
massive
smoke
going
on
here
as
would
be
suggested
by
the
name
even
with
this
fact
it
was
still
pretty
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
get
an
opportunity
poured
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
a
left
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
it
had
a
very
nice
smoke
aroma
upfront
but
had
roasty
character
mild
chocolate
faint
caramel
and
slight
chipotle
pepper
notes
the
roasted
character
and
chocolate
flavors
were
more
apparent
on
the
palate
with
caramel
smokey
accents
with
a
touch
of
chipotle
peppers
whicxh
added
a
little
zing
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
smokey
roasty
subtle
sweet
and
slight
spicey
finish
i
really
like
my
smokey
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
tasted
great
drank
great
and
had
exactly
what
i
like
out
of
a
smokey
brew
d
for
a
rich
smoky
beer
this
is
so
drinkable
very
good
beer
nice
bottle
will
keep
for
display
fuller
medium
body
lighter
carbonation
creamy
and
pleasant
on
the
tongue
drinks
faster
than
it
should
the
abv
is
masked
well
and
the
smoke
is
much
lighter
than
many
other
simpler
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
ive
heard
a
lot
about
and
since
i
like
smoke
in
dark
beers
this
is
one
of
my
more
preferred
styles
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
darkness
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
smell
is
mostly
smoke
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
chocolate
though
there
is
so
much
smoke
its
hard
to
tell
the
flavor
is
thankfully
toned
down
on
the
smoke
to
the
point
of
near
perfection
there
is
also
a
malty
sweetness
that
comes
through
to
help
complement
the
smoke
that
is
on
the
palate
the
beer
finishes
a
tad
too
bitter
for
my
liking
but
drinks
pretty
smooth
for
the
other
portions
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
gift
from
2
thanks
eric
drinkability
what
an
amazing
and
pleasant
surprise
an
evening
that
started
with
one
disappointment
tuverbol
is
capped
by
one
fantastic
brew
and
i
couldnt
be
more
thrilled
this
beer
is
just
so
balanced
so
flavorful
and
all
things
told
at
8
2
so
drinkable
not
to
say
its
not
there
im
certainly
feeling
it
nonetheless
i
want
more
of
this
and
could
definitely
keep
coming
back
for
more
of
this
crisp
flavorful
balanced
brew
also
stick
this
in
barrels
and
id
marry
it
like
tomorrow
good
beer
not
great
beer
but
still
worth
seeking
out
a
little
too
thin
for
me
to
love
it
d
good
flavor
and
body
with
a
high
abv
but
still
easy
to
drink
d
very
nice
stuff
the
smoke
is
very
easy
to
deal
with
here
d
its
pretty
easy
to
finish
1
but
could
i
drink
2
probably
not
the
smokiness
is
just
a
little
bit
too
intense
still
a
great
brew
glad
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
above
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
drinkability
is
very
good
it
had
some
great
bold
flavors
to
it
but
yet
remained
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
chocolate
was
especially
nice
the
smoke
was
good
but
was
probably
more
intense
fresher
very
good
beer
overall
very
good
beer
the
oak
is
for
me
a
critical
component
that
kept
this
one
sane
drinkable
glad
to
finally
meet
you
smoke
ridiculously
smooth
and
tasty
i
havent
had
darkness
on
tap
yet
and
until
i
do
this
remains
my
favorite
offering
from
surly
and
thats
saying
something
overall
another
great
limited
release
from
surly
this
beer
just
reminds
me
of
fallwinter
would
be
perfect
while
sitting
around
a
fire
the
name
really
is
dead
on
as
the
biggest
thing
that
stuck
with
me
is
its
smokey
characteristics
poured
into
a
mug
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
2
finger
head
the
smoke
smell
was
in
my
opinion
a
little
too
strong
the
taste
was
ok
but
again
i
thought
it
was
too
smokey
it
was
smooth
at
the
start
and
a
medium
bitter
on
the
tail
end
drinkability
was
somewhat
low
due
to
the
over
powering
flavor
and
slightly
elevated
abv
quite
drinkable
as
noted
the
alcohol
was
wellmasked
and
the
smoke
added
character
without
overpowering
the
rest
all
in
all
this
is
a
truly
fantastic
beer
ill
be
trying
to
find
a
few
more
bottles
around
town
before
it
sells
out
the
smokiness
is
a
limiting
factor
in
drinking
a
lot
of
this
but
i
do
love
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
that
you
cant
see
through
there
is
also
an
off
white
tan
looking
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
smells
of
smoke
and
roasted
malts
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
piece
of
oakwood
that
was
burnt
and
thrown
into
the
aging
tank
it
is
a
very
good
taste
balanaced
with
malt
and
hops
the
carbonation
is
low
to
moderate
and
i
would
consider
this
a
drinkable
beer
i
like
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
been
lucky
enought
to
sample
if
you
are
able
to
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
dont
let
go
of
it
smoke
has
a
medium
to
full
body
the
smoke
flavor
really
explodes
on
the
palate
dark
malt
mixes
with
the
smoke
that
roasted
it
to
create
a
satisfying
flavor
profile
toward
the
end
the
alcohol
warms
the
chest
a
well
made
winter
brew
with
ample
complexity
built
around
a
smoky
backbone
if
you
love
smoked
beer
you
will
be
in
heaven
if
smoke
isnt
your
think
it
will
remind
you
of
hell
this
is
a
remarkable
brew
in
that
despite
beinga
smoky
roasted
malty
beer
the
flavor
profiles
converge
to
recall
a
delciously
strong
and
complex
wine
like
a
chateauneuf
du
pape
woody
smokiness
licorice
cherriescharred
smokiness
blackberries
and
vanilla
very
unusual
and
very
compelling
i
keep
tasting
it
and
while
it
is
carbonated
and
therefore
doesnt
feel
like
a
wine
it
is
bitter
and
roasted
and
that
is
not
like
a
wine
the
flavor
keeps
tasting
like
a
string
rich
extracted
powerful
wine
very
nice
i
expected
to
taste
way
more
smoke
in
this
than
i
did
it
feels
more
like
a
smoked
imperial
stout
than
anything
else
not
bad
tho
not
bad
at
all
d
as
stated
above
it
went
into
the
drain
drinkability
the
smoke
isnt
intense
initially
but
is
lingering
this
is
good
for
me
as
besides
the
smoke
the
basic
baltic
porter
elements
are
quite
tasty
a
solid
beer
from
surly
again
not
sure
ill
pick
up
more
than
1
of
these
each
year
though
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
developes
overall
another
great
beer
from
surly
unique
complex
and
definitely
not
subtle
ive
always
like
a
good
smoked
beer
so
this
one
hit
the
spot
for
me
lots
of
smoky
character
but
still
very
drinkable
good
stuff
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
nose
is
really
quite
smoky
although
it
doesnt
go
so
far
that
its
overpowering
a
bit
meat
roasted
malt
and
some
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
underneath
quite
complex
taste
is
a
bit
less
so
as
there
is
some
general
chocolate
and
roast
below
the
heavy
smoke
character
but
the
smoke
is
definitely
stealing
the
show
all
the
smoke
and
meaty
flavors
bring
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
this
drinks
quite
well
especially
comparing
it
against
similar
beers
drinkability
while
very
rich
and
complex
it
doesnt
take
long
for
the
deep
smoke
flavor
to
become
overwhelming
couldnt
see
myself
have
more
than
a
single
12oz
pour
overall
a
complex
and
flavourful
porter
for
sure
the
appearance
was
slightly
lacking
and
the
palate
a
little
light
but
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
skål
an
overall
good
beer
d
very
for
its
strength
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
damn
tasty
beer
very
smooth
drinking
lots
of
complex
flavors
that
blend
together
nicely
never
been
let
down
by
surly
yet
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
silky
smooth
a
bit
of
warmth
going
down
a
great
beer
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
great
nice
balance
great
depth
a
tasty
baltic
and
smoked
beer
d
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
can
get
an
aecht
schlenkerla
rauch
bier
that
tastes
better
for
way
less
trouble
drinkability
for
whatever
reason
my
bottle
lacked
carbonation
still
a
fine
example
of
a
creatively
brewed
beer
by
the
folks
at
surly
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
id
surly
regret
it
in
the
morning
awesome
awesome
beer
thanks
again
russ
o
just
another
example
of
why
surly
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
the
best
in
the
business
d
this
was
a
good
brew
overall
classic
smoked
porter
i
have
new
glarus
smoke
on
the
porter
and
i
am
interested
to
compare
this
experience
to
that
brew
certainly
above
average
and
worth
seeking
out
im
sure
this
would
be
outstanding
to
age
unfortunately
i
have
no
more
d
given
the
heartiness
and
flavour
present
in
this
brew
it
is
great
not
even
sure
of
the
abv
the
prospect
of
a
smoked
baltic
porter
i
need
new
pants
lets
do
this
shit
it
pours
an
opaque
scorched
brown
with
a
small
amount
of
tan
foam
on
top
the
nose
comprises
charcoalsmoked
ham
roasted
malts
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
salivation
has
begun
in
earnest
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sweet
syrup
molasses
brown
sugar
spruce
and
caramel
up
front
leading
a
healthy
puff
of
light
smoke
the
flavors
may
not
necessarily
stand
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
smell
but
they
do
come
very
close
and
besides
its
still
pretty
damn
tasty
regardless
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rich
oily
feel
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
i
am
very
pleased
indeed
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
beast
now
ive
gotta
find
a
way
to
get
more
d
excellent
choice
for
my
100th
review
another
great
brew
from
surly
medium
bodied
smooth
sipper
an
easy
brew
that
i
can
easily
have
more
than
a
couple
of
glasses
of
i
recommend
this
brew
if
you
can
find
it
yet
on
a
shelf
or
trade
for
it
cheers
chewy
viscous
medium
body
that
again
is
only
slightly
smokey
very
well
balanced
with
lots
of
luscious
chocolate
malt
goodness
slightly
spivey
possibly
with
anise
as
well
as
some
hops
to
comiment
the
roastysmokey
notes
hints
of
deep
roasted
coffee
bean
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
burnt
toast
and
toffee
as
in
the
aroma
the
smokiness
isnt
as
intense
as
expected
only
subtle
hints
of
vampire
butane
bacon
charcoal
bbq
etc
integrated
into
the
flavor
very
complex
excellently
balanced
and
the
high
abv
is
pretty
well
masked
making
this
beer
ery
quaffable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
didnt
find
it
as
smokey
as
i
expected
or
hoped
for
highly
recommend
but
i
would
warn
the
smokeheads
out
there
that
this
beer
isnt
that
intense
in
that
regard
ddefinitely
a
good
bit
of
smoke
with
a
good
malty
sweetness
and
nice
hop
presence
in
the
finish
solid
drink
here
with
some
nice
maltiness
going
on
drinkability
this
one
was
very
easy
to
down
what
else
can
you
say
its
a
good
baltic
porter
brimming
with
smooth
smokiness
d
a
nice
showcase
of
roasted
and
smoked
malts
everything
is
in
nice
balance
the
abv
is
undetectable
i
am
convinced
that
surly
is
incapable
of
brewing
a
beer
that
is
anything
less
than
spectacular
toasty
dark
malt
smoke
light
roast
and
astringent
rubber
smoke
is
well
integrated
present
at
a
subtle
level
mediumlight
body
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
finishes
with
smoke
rubber
roasted
malt
the
body
is
spot
on
but
the
rubbery
flavor
is
very
detracting
dthis
is
probably
the
most
subtle
smoky
beer
ive
had
the
smoke
is
definitely
there
but
it
doesnt
override
everything
else
going
on
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
most
porters
lots
of
malty
sweetness
and
toastiness
the
smoky
flavor
carries
in
the
aftertaste
for
a
long
time
if
anything
could
be
improved
flavorwise
id
like
to
ramp
up
the
smoked
malts
and
dial
down
the
sweetness
very
solid
beer
overall
even
better
than
i
expected
this
would
be
as
a
highly
rated
beer
from
a
brewery
i
really
like
great
drinkability
for
a
smoked
porter
of
this
abv
an
awesome
example
of
the
beer
but
again
not
as
good
as
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
the
past
ill
have
to
have
another
bottle
i
guess
d
a
pleasure
to
drink
xomparing
my
notes
i
am
left
with
the
distinct
impression
something
was
lost
between
one
of
those
first
batches
i
had
on
tap
and
this
bottle
good
but
very
far
from
the
greatness
i
noticed
the
first
time
quite
disappointing
another
example
of
surly
showing
us
why
we
love
them
overall
yet
another
very
good
beer
from
surly
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
would
recommend
to
all
overall
this
is
definitely
a
fine
beer
but
one
that
is
designed
for
a
specific
palate
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
d
fairly
drinkable
definately
drinkable
for
the
style
very
solid
3
5
d
good
beer
but
a
lot
of
room
to
improve
the
base
recipe
is
solid
but
a
higher
mash
temp
and
some
flaked
barley
or
wheat
could
do
wonders
once
again
another
feather
in
surlys
hat
solid
and
unique
beer
thanks
tdg
md
a
little
bit
thinner
then
i
remembered
it
to
be
when
i
had
it
at
the
surly
beer
dinner
the
happy
gnome
in
feb
medium
body
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
higher
side
at
first
but
dies
down
to
hardly
anything
after
a
short
while
abv
is
hidden
pretty
well
a
cold
fallwinter
night
sipper
drinkability
is
pretty
good
considering
the
style
overall
i
think
i
liked
this
slightly
better
on
tap
but
cant
really
complain
about
this
in
bottle
form
i
dont
really
see
this
improving
too
much
in
the
bottle
but
it
certainly
wont
get
any
worse
the
palate
is
solid
opening
moderately
fruity
with
a
blend
of
raisins
and
dates
coupled
with
some
medium
dark
chocolate
50
and
vanilla
sweetness
with
some
smoke
to
tie
it
all
together
this
is
actually
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
the
smoke
character
is
moderate
to
low
and
is
well
integrated
licorice
is
noticeable
midpalate
alcohol
does
appear
on
the
finish
thats
dry
fruity
a
little
smoky
and
a
little
astringent
theres
also
a
touch
of
splendalike
sweetness
on
the
finish
these
two
do
detract
marginally
from
a
great
experience
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thanks
again
bill
overall
this
is
another
awesome
beer
from
surly
it
seems
that
every
thing
they
brew
rocks
pretty
hard
i
think
some
people
might
be
looking
for
more
smoke
flavor
in
this
beer
but
the
complexity
and
smoothness
that
the
brewers
bought
to
this
offering
will
make
most
people
forget
any
complaints
they
may
have
had
awesome
job
surly
im
eagerly
awaiting
the
release
of
four
this
beer
is
absolutely
a
treat
surly
scores
again
get
your
hands
on
some
if
you
can
enjoyed
on
tap
at
acadia
cafe
in
minneapolis
mn
poured
into
a
stemmed
tulip
glass
this
beer
shows
an
extremely
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
ring
of
offwhite
foam
aroma
is
raisins
peat
burnt
sugar
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
low
to
medium
carbonation
level
flavors
are
of
caramelized
sugar
dried
grass
and
level
smokiness
hop
bitterness
shows
for
a
moment
in
the
finish
and
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
dry
malt
sweetness
i
was
expecting
much
more
smoke
flavors
but
this
is
still
a
solid
baltic
porter
i
bought
2
bottles
from
heritage
for
like
14
and
then
one
from
haskells
stillwater
for
closer
to
16
so
this
is
certainly
not
a
cheap
beer
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
i
have
one
to
trade
drinkability
lots
of
big
flavors
going
on
here
but
all
done
in
moderation
and
considering
the
8
this
thing
is
hella
drinkable
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
i
a
smoked
beer
fan
and
id
love
a
bit
more
smoke
in
this
who
knows
though
maybe
it
would
screw
this
up
royally
enjoyed
yet
again
drinkability
overall
very
nice
balance
between
a
baltic
porter
rauchbier
and
oakaged
beer
delicious
and
very
easy
to
drink
belaying
its
8
2
abv
md
a
bit
lighter
than
i
was
anticipating
but
still
very
full
bodied
and
smooth
its
a
great
sipper
and
would
accompany
bbq
quite
nicely
this
however
is
a
smoked
brew
that
is
amazing
on
its
own
like
i
said
before
this
beer
has
surly
wriiten
all
over
it
they
can
do
no
wrong
medium
bodied
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
with
no
problem
d
good
portion
of
smoke
mouthfeel
is
just
right
big
in
flavor
but
refreshing
good
on
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
this
one
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
but
it
was
still
quite
good
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
bottle
sometime
down
the
road
to
see
how
it
fares
with
some
age
d
easy
to
drink
no
real
hint
of
alcohol
another
winner
by
surly
d
this
beer
was
described
to
me
as
a
stout
along
the
lines
of
bcs
but
smokier
that
description
is
quite
inaccurate
for
a
beer
named
smoke
i
was
expecting
a
heavier
beer
with
a
more
pronounced
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
but
in
the
end
im
glad
the
smokiness
wasnt
overdone
as
it
created
a
beer
with
a
better
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
baltic
porter
its
not
nearly
heavy
or
sweet
enough
id
call
it
a
pseudo
rauch
and
for
that
its
pretty
damn
tasty
total
41
550
very
good
beer
overall
and
a
distinct
example
of
the
style
in
that
i
didnt
get
the
typical
black
patent
malt
flavors
that
are
typically
found
in
baltic
porters
yet
more
evidence
that
surly
is
among
the
elite
breweries
in
the
world
d
for
such
a
strong
beer
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
have
become
a
fan
of
baltic
porters
recently
and
while
there
are
others
that
i
like
more
i
would
definitley
get
this
one
again
if
i
saw
it
around
d
the
rauchmalz
if
thats
what
they
used
is
well
balanced
with
the
other
ingredients
this
isnt
a
subtle
beer
but
it
is
quite
harmonious
and
drinkable
had
this
twice
in
the
past
couple
of
weeks
on
tap
once
at
the
release
party
and
this
evening
at
grumpys
in
ne
mpls
poured
black
very
little
head
which
dissipated
fairly
quickly
slight
smell
of
smoke
and
maltiness
i
had
expected
more
but
with
little
head
and
carbonation
to
be
expected
i
suppose
the
smoke
balanced
nicely
with
a
subtle
bittersweetness
somewhere
between
medium
and
fullbodied
the
balance
and
creamy
texture
made
this
very
easy
to
drink
although
i
dont
know
that
id
session
it
love
to
see
this
in
bottles
or
cans
next
year
had
this
at
the
release
party
at
brasas
on
113009
was
poured
from
tap
into
a
10oz
glass
little
to
no
head
was
a
little
bit
of
a
dissappointment
not
sure
if
that
was
caused
by
the
pour
or
if
it
is
just
that
way
needless
to
say
the
lack
of
head
hindered
the
aroma
of
the
beer
a
little
smelled
of
slight
smoke
and
a
subtle
sweetness
what
a
taste
though
very
smooth
with
a
slight
smoke
taste
that
ends
with
a
subtle
sweetness
just
like
the
smell
i
guess
very
drinkable
with
a
name
like
smoke
i
was
expecting
a
smoked
porter
taste
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
an
extremely
good
beer
love
to
see
it
in
bottle
or
can
overall
i
was
a
little
worried
that
the
smoke
was
going
to
be
to
much
for
me
but
surly
really
blended
this
well
very
drinkable
to
me
considering
smokes
arent
my
favorite
if
you
get
a
chance
give
this
beer
a
try
very
interesting
brew
one
of
the
few
smoke
beers
that
i
have
liked
appearance
is
very
good
lots
of
head
dark
in
color
and
nice
cascading
smell
is
pretty
good
but
almost
all
smoke
some
roasted
nut
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
a
lot
of
smoke
but
more
of
the
malt
comes
through
here
some
sweetness
like
caramel
as
well
nice
and
thick
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
another
fine
surly
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
has
sweet
roasty
malts
and
a
nice
smokey
presence
oak
vanilla
ripe
fruits
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
also
quite
smokey
but
well
balanced
by
the
roasty
malts
sweet
fruits
cocoa
vanilla
and
wood
creamy
body
is
very
well
carbonated
let
see
some
bottles
overall
pretty
drinkable
the
smoke
flavor
is
not
too
overpowering
generous
amount
of
roasted
malt
there
is
a
very
nice
hoppyness
towards
the
end
that
gives
this
beer
an
extra
bit
of
character
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
ever
had
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
smokey
porter
overall
very
good
porter
nice
arbonation
and
very
enjoyable
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
highly
drinkable
beer
as
well
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
out
as
much
as
it
should
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
one
of
surlys
most
impressive
overall
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
this
one
it
was
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
i
have
ever
had
and
tasted
more
complex
then
just
about
anything
else
in
the
category
this
is
a
must
get
that
it
looks
like
you
will
have
to
go
to
mn
to
go
get
now
d
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
smoked
things
and
i
actually
liked
this
beer
i
think
it
is
well
balanced
in
regards
to
the
smoky
flavors
it
really
fit
well
with
my
adobo
pork
dish
id
try
this
again
with
certain
foods
but
probably
not
on
its
own
ill
search
for
it
when
i
have
another
adobo
dish
or
if
i
have
something
in
the
way
of
a
bacon
cheddar
burger
id
recommend
giving
this
one
a
whirl
d
i
cant
see
being
excessive
with
this
beer
have
had
56
pints
of
this
to
date
but
never
back
to
back
also
maybe
its
psychological
but
this
thing
tasted
better
at
the
brewery
i
swear
very
good
much
better
then
my
plastic
cup
at
the
brewery
no
signs
of
alcahol
at
the
knose
but
some
mild
warming
comes
around
after
the
swallow
with
the
lingering
bitterness
a
beautiful
beer
3
75
d
for
me
not
to
high
it
was
fun
to
try
but
it
was
just
not
my
style
i
graded
it
higher
because
it
accomplished
what
they
whated
to
accomplish
just
not
for
me
though
di
like
this
beer
its
tasty
with
its
namesake
smokey
flavor
prominent
but
not
near
overpowering
the
balance
of
the
flavor
its
an
enjoyable
brew
hearty
and
great
to
enjoy
while
watching
the
wind
blow
outside
complex
in
flavor
enjoyable
to
drink
d
a
slow
drinker
but
nice
a
good
beer
pours
very
dark
nearly
pitch
black
good
brown
head
that
holds
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
very
sweet
and
very
smoky
loads
of
smoke
but
not
really
abrasive
which
is
impressive
the
hops
come
out
much
more
in
the
drink
some
citrus
and
loads
of
resins
deep
cola
tastes
with
grapy
notes
and
loads
of
dark
sweetness
the
smoke
balances
throughout
the
drink
and
seems
to
be
in
all
the
tastes
body
is
nearly
full
and
very
smooth
abv
is
big
and
this
was
my
last
review
of
the
day
lol
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
with
a
great
smoothness
to
it
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
it
was
overall
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
maybe
it
was
just
the
freshness
of
the
beer
or
the
fact
that
i
was
drinking
it
at
the
brewery
but
it
was
sooo
good
had
this
on
tap
at
dday
poured
a
dark
brown
color
nice
tan
foam
smoke
in
the
nose
mixed
some
sweet
malts
and
light
hop
bitterness
nice
smoke
flavor
some
chocolate
and
green
hoppiness
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
abv
was
9
5
on
that
brew
it
was
easily
drinkable
but
the
smoke
flavor
is
only
good
for
one
beer
at
a
time
nice
and
interesting
offering
from
surly
dday
was
great
and
was
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
neat
i
usually
think
of
rauchbiers
and
smokes
as
occasional
treats
brews
you
might
finish
the
night
with
but
you
would
never
consider
pounding
at
length
this
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
sessionready
smoke
beer
ive
ever
come
across
it
certainly
didnt
taste
like
it
was
9
5
abv
and
frankly
id
be
surprised
if
that
listing
wasnt
in
error
but
if
its
anywhere
close
to
correct
that
holy
mother
this
is
one
dangerous
beer
i
could
have
had
about
3
more
of
these
highlighting
the
drinkability
its
good
stuff
its
really
easy
to
forget
this
ones
9
5
watch
out
overall
i
am
not
the
biggest
smoked
beer
fan
so
i
am
not
gangbusters
over
this
beer
but
you
have
to
respect
the
quality
or
this
beer
and
all
the
flavor
juxtaposition
going
on
the
smokiness
was
toned
back
enough
that
i
could
really
enjoy
it
especially
when
having
one
with
a
meal
rather
than
as
session
ale
very
good
quaff
drinkability
is
all
right
for
such
a
big
smoky
beer
but
i
really
couldnt
handle
more
than
a
full
glass
of
this
overall
good
easy
to
drink
could
use
more
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
d
proper
serving
temp
is
the
key
with
this
this
drank
like
a
porter
with
half
the
abv
excellent
served
on
tap
in
a
tulip
glass
at
stubherbs
this
pours
a
beautiful
opaque
black
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
and
scant
white
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
faint
i
detect
an
alcoholic
brandylike
smell
the
taste
is
wonderfully
complex
with
a
cherry
brandy
flavor
along
with
a
smoky
toasty
chocolate
malt
presence
as
well
as
a
slight
taste
of
vanilla
there
is
just
enough
hop
presence
to
balance
the
other
flavors
this
is
a
terrific
tasting
beer
with
rich
and
lingering
flavors
the
high
alcohol
content
is
the
only
thing
marring
the
drinkability
this
is
another
exceptional
beer
from
surly
im
not
sure
if
i
like
smoked
beer
or
not
but
i
could
tell
there
was
a
lot
at
work
here
and
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
if
given
the
opportunity
drinkability
damn
good
abv
is
hidden
well
the
smoke
flavor
was
there
but
was
not
overpowering
recommended
lingering
tan
head
opaque
yep
grillsmoke
and
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
creamy
chocolatehops
upfront
subtle
smoke
in
an
otherwise
warm
finish
strong
tasty
want
to
pair
it
with
smoked
venison
summer
sausage
i
had
this
on
tap
at
cafe
twenty
eight
this
beer
is
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
was
small
when
the
beer
arrived
but
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
lasted
until
the
beer
was
gone
the
aroma
is
immense
smoke
bacon
maple
syrup
burnt
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
is
as
large
as
the
aroma
the
smoked
flavors
are
prevalent
but
are
well
balanced
with
the
beers
other
attributes
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
silky
in
texture
and
has
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
beer
to
contemplate
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
near
black
with
a
generous
dark
tan
head
good
staying
power
nice
lacing
quite
lovely
the
aroma
is
a
little
more
mellow
than
id
imagined
smoked
malts
more
chill
some
nice
bacon
yum
smoked
salmon
some
chocolate
and
faintly
earthy
hop
notes
the
taste
follows
the
same
lines
but
better
more
complex
perhaps
the
chocolates
and
caramels
and
toffees
peeking
out
the
smoke
is
still
understated
any
meaty
connotations
well
balanced
the
body
is
delightful
silky
smooth
a
little
warmth
is
all
the
warning
you
get
from
this
strong
brew
in
all
i
had
to
keep
switching
from
this
to
another
brew
but
i
kept
coming
back
and
back
and
back
and
back
this
was
a
well
balanced
medium
bodied
well
rounded
beer
this
is
a
thinking
womans
beer
plenty
to
ponder
and
more
to
enjoy
go
find
some
before
its
gone
inky
black
soft
looking
creamy
brown
head
a
full
sheet
of
lace
is
laid
down
as
i
drink
the
aroma
is
quite
subtle
smoke
is
subtle
there
are
nice
roasty
and
chocolatey
malt
tones
as
well
but
reserved
as
a
whole
on
the
palate
theres
a
bit
of
that
phenolic
smokey
stuff
going
on
bacony
in
nature
nice
roasted
bitterness
the
phenolic
slightly
medicinal
nature
is
a
little
strong
for
my
personal
taste
but
it
adds
some
character
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
slightly
alcoholic
flaccid
feel
not
particularily
creamy
or
velvety
o
k
though
this
beer
reminds
me
of
my
own
smoked
porter
which
garnered
2nd
overall
at
the
nhc
this
year
and
as
with
mine
i
feel
that
this
is
merely
good
not
great
theres
just
one
thing
id
like
to
say
to
the
folks
at
surly
is
there
anything
you
cant
do
another
home
run
from
surly
try
it
if
you
can
a
phenomenal
brew
from
surly
delightfully
drinkable
and
versatile
a
departure
from
the
traditional
surly
style
though
more
than
welcome
hoppinessi
would
welcome
this
beer
anytime
time
of
the
year
drinkability
tastewise
is
nice
sessionability
slowed
a
bit
by
high
abv
and
strong
strong
flavors
overall
impression
i
had
2
and
am
glad
i
went
home
when
i
did
3
would
have
been
too
much
for
being
3pm
and
i
would
have
had
to
go
to
bed
with
that
said
i
loved
the
beer
and
believe
it
is
another
classic
surly
beer
not
true
to
the
style
but
damn
good
none
the
less
this
is
highly
drinkable
dangerous
even
another
triumph
for
the
geniuses
at
surly
bring
on
the
two
quite
tasty
kind
of
reminds
me
of
bender
but
with
a
smoky
aftertaste
good
stuff
too
bad
they
dont
can
this
otherwise
id
buy
more
really
magnificent
this
needs
to
go
in
bombers
and
blow
some
minds
out
there
til
that
happens
im
happy
to
drink
it
down
on
tap
right
here
ahhh
this
was
a
phenomenal
brew
this
is
probably
the
best
surly
brew
behind
darkness
i
polished
one
of
these
off
easily
and
i
could
have
pounded
more
but
i
felt
compelled
to
try
the
teabagged
furious
cask
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
ahhh
but
here
is
where
i
think
that
term
smoke
came
from
other
then
the
obvious
use
of
smoked
malts
as
its
the
abv
that
renders
itself
like
smoke
from
a
fire
smoldering
in
your
head
it
builds
slowly
at
first
filling
your
head
gradually
with
smoke
eventually
and
before
you
know
it
your
head
is
a
blaze
of
swimming
glee
from
the
abv
wow
one
sneaky
fuckin
beer
watch
out
for
this
one
be
sure
to
drink
water
to
help
slow
the
smoke
whew
pours
clear
deep
brown
color
thick
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
too
quickly
this
is
a
heavy
maltysweet
beer
creamy
with
a
caramel
after
taste
nice
porter
with
a
lot
of
flavor
the
downside
is
that
its
a
bit
metallic
in
the
taste
but
otherwise
a
very
good
and
quite
easy
to
drink
porter
if
they
cut
down
the
sweetness
with
some
additional
roasted
malt
this
would
be
much
better
as
it
is
now
its
just
an
average
but
still
fairly
tasty
porter
500
ml
bottle

pours
nearly
opaque
dark

color
with
a
2
finger
fairly
dense
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing

a
fair
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of

nice
and

moderately
creamy
and
slightly
chalky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
baltic
porter
style
good
balance
and
robustness
of
darkbready
malt
and
yeast
ester
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
pours
actually
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
small
beige
head
that
settles
down
to
a
very
thin
layer
on
top
with
most
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
brown
sugar
very
nice
the
taste
ia
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
coming
through
at
the
end
along
with
the
brown
sugar
a
really
tasty
brew
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
with
perfect
carbonation
for
this
type
of
brew
style
never
had
a
baltic
porter
let
alone
from
latvia
almost
like
a
foreign
export
stout
in
places
especially
when
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
made
itself
known
alongside
the
sweetness
that
ran
all
the
way
through
the
drink
the
beer
was
drinkable
but
not
all
that
enjoyable
with
the
alcohol
coming
across
a
little
harsh
and
no
of
the
flavours
really
working
well
with
the
others
o
a
good
solid
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixpack
of
these
it
goes
down
really
smooth
and
brings
a
nice
punch
of
roasty
flavors
it
does
get
a
bit
more
interesting
i
had
to
leave
only
having
finished
a
bit
more
than
half
the
mug
and
came
back
in
1
hour
by
then
the
beer
was
completely
flat
and
slightly
warmer
no
noticeable
nose
change
but
the
taste
was
radically
altered
it
showed
more
licoricelike
sweetness
and
the
initial
acidity
was
completely
replaced
with
darkfruit
flavor
stronger
cherry
notes
if
it
werent
for
the
body
the
taste
almost
approached
that
of
a
good
coffee
stout
its
no
bourbon
county
but
still
more
interesting
than
expected
i
like
this
beer
i
asked
the
beer
guy
at
the
store
for
a
good
malty
porter
and
he
suggested
this
it
was
a
homerun
sweeter
than
most
of
the
baltic
porters
i
have
had
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
bought
3
of
these
and
had
one
last
week
and
liked
it
just
opened
the
second
tonight
and
feel
the
same
way
i
sipped
it
over
the
course
of
an
hour
taste
is
pretty
constant
from
cold
to
room
temp
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
mainly
malt
favor
but
is
a
beer
i
will
keep
on
hand
price
was
1
89
for
a
16
9
oz
bottle
overall
a
tasty
and
drinkable
baltic
porter
i
think
this
is
my
first
latvian
beer
and
im
not
disappointed
overalll
seems
like
a
solid
example
of
the
style
baltic
porter
from
the
actual
baltic
region
picked
up
a
500ml
bottle
for
2
at
euro
market
id
like
more
roast
in
this
beer
instead
its
too
sweet
with
a
slight
cola
theres
a
chocolate
edge
to
it
but
overall
the
beer
isnt
that
pleasant
it
reminds
me
of
the
caribbeans
sugary
export
stouts
but
its
as
tasty
the
body
is
appropriately
thick
for
a
6
8
porter
and
the
body
is
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
not
expensive
but
not
really
worth
a
try
unless
you
love
the
style
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
dark
colalike
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
and
a
tan
head
the
retention
of
the
cap
and
then
the
collar
was
good
and
it
left
lacing
in
sliding
curtains
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
booze
light
hops
and
whole
wheat
bread
the
flavors
were
good
starting
with
a
sweet
note
of
caramel
and
toffee
but
augmented
by
the
darker
elements
of
bittersweet
chocolate
molasses
coffee
rye
bread
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
an
inexpensive
tasty
offering
from
farflung
latvia
btw
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
this
beer
is
that
the
label
lists
it
as
a
lager
ale
what
in
the
f
luvit
the
beer
had
a
lovely
dark
color
with
a
sizable
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
beer
ribboned
nicely
and
had
a
sweet
full
bodied
stout
taste
overall
a
nice
porter
and
a
good
deal
for
the
price
a
definite
must
taste
if
you
a
fan
of
porters
the
bottle
design
is
also
very
attractive
from
the
25
fl
oz
bottle
marked
batch
no
811
sampled
on
november
19
2011
the
pour
is
dark
brown
to
nearly
black
with
a
whole
lot
of
silky
head
and
lacing
malts
head
up
the
aroma
on
the
nose
with
a
sweet
and
yeasty
back
end
the
body
is
medium
and
pleasantly
silky
on
my
tongue
the
taste
has
a
plentiful
malty
character
with
a
bitterness
and
moderate
hop
bite
at
the
finale
the
short
review
is
that
this
is
malty
and
pungent
pours
a
deep
root

through

does

alchohol

mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
to
rich
for
the
palate
and
a
little
light
for
the
style
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
because
its
not
very
fullbodied
and
has
a
lower
alcohol
content
although
the
taste
is
a
little
weak
dpretty
easy
drinking
and
a
solid
example
of
a
baltic
porter
pairs
very
well
with
a
spicy
carnitas
burrito
its
hard
to
tell
with
some
beers
but
either
i
got
used
to
the
sweetness
after
a
few
sips
or
it
became
less
sweet
after
sitting
and
breathing
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
definitely
a
sweet
beer
but
i
was
able
to
enjoy
it
but
overall
its
a
great
porter
stout
and
it
is
worth
to
try
drinkability
outstanding
will
do
excellent
as
a
complement
to
rustic
swedish
husmanskost
and
obviously
it
does
very
well
on
its
own
nice
enough
beverage
gotta
admit
i
picked
this
up
because
latvian
reference
from
the
episode
of
seinfeld
where
george
converts
to
latvian
orthodox
church
and
proclaims
that
he
most
admires
their
hats
im
glad
that
a
cheeky
reference
led
me
to
trying
this
one
out
as
it
is
actually
pretty
intriguing
d
decent
hardly
worth
a
try
i
really
like
this
one
and
at

not

i

same
as

almost
tastes
and
feels
like
a

beer
bit
sweet
for
a
session
d
never
again
i
dont
understand
how
this
beer
has
such
a
high
rating
avoid
for
me
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
as
a
fan
of
porters
i
snagged
a
bottle
of
this
on
my
last
trip
to
my
favorite
local
store
the
pour
from
the
pint
16
9
oz
bottle
produced
a
strong
and
persistent
light
tan
head
dark
almost
black
pour
with
gold
as
opposed
to
red
highlights
the
smell
and
taste
reminded
me
more
of
stout
than
porter
with
significant
roasted
barley
in
both
the
nose
and
the
mouth
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
an
unpleasant
porter
but
it
is
definitely
toward
the
darker
more
roasted
barley
end
of
the
spectrum
and
not
a
lot
of
pleasurable
malty
sweetness
the
bite
of
the
roasted
flavors
is
quite
persistent
lingering
on
the
tongue
long
after
the
swallow
flavor
notes
include
raisins
currants
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
i
would
say
average
for
porters
substantial
but
perhaps
a
bit
less
substantial
than
the
taste
would
suggest
not
watery
but
not
as
fully
satisfying
as
the
best
baltic
porters
for
example
i
prefer
southhamptons
offering
over
this
aldaris
even
though
i
gave
them
both
a
b
still
sweet
beers
also
worth
your
time
and
bradlikesbrewmay
01
is
how
id
describe
the
mediumbodys
texture
caramel
and
cocoa
make
it
a
sweet
beer
this
beer
is
big
and
round
chocolate
and
deserving
of
a
spot
at
the
grownups
table
i
believe
this
was
in
the
2
range
for
500ml
hovering
right
in
between
syrupy
and
refreshingly
bubbly
but
you
would
never
know
it
it
is
totally
concealed
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
a
great

comments
this
could
be
the
quintessential
dessert
beer

especially
for
people
who
complain
that
beer
is
too
bitter
certainly
an
interesting
offering
but
compared
to
other
very
similar
brews
this
would
be
low
on
my
list
while
drinking
the
first
half
of
the
glass
i
was
trying
to
decide
what
i
thought
of
it
along
with
the

and

not
disappoint
beerbob0
o
an
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
porter
with
a
good
malt
profile
and
hop
bite
if
perhaps
a
bit
mild
compared
to
some
of
todays
imperials
needs
to
be
around
the
suggested
55
degrees
or
warmer
to
taste
its
best
overall
nice
sent
and
a
good
appearance
but
the
taste
is
fairly
boring
quite
drinkable
but
just
not
something
that
id
have
any
reason
to
search
out
again
the
aroma
is
wht
weak
spot
for
me
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
presenting
a
slightly
sour
note
improved
maredly
with
some
warmingairing
the
taste
is
better
with
just
an
acceptable
hint
of
sourness
at
times
but
a
little
more
burnt
flavor
than
i
prefer
still
nicely
rich
dark
malt
flavor
with
a
momentary
hit
of
sweet
up
front
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
slight
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
char
and
dark
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
fairly
boring
in
my
opinion
overall
probably
should
pass
this
one
by
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
just
quotidian
it
seems
to
be
true
to
the
style
guidelines
and
mellows
out
as
it
opens
up
however
it
doesnt
become
more
interesting
o
i
gave
it
an
ok
i
had
it
after
a
yards
tavern
porter
which
at
7
abv
is
just
a
notch
under
this
supposedly
imperial
offering
and
i
preferred
the
yards
pugsley
sig
looks
fantastic
poured
dark
and
rich
with
impressive
look
at
me
head
that
lingers
on
forever
but
the
nose
is
weak
with
a
faint
hint
of
metallic
notes
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
though
taste
not
so
much
starts
interesting
toasted
malts
and
hard
coffee
but
soon
butterscotch
flavor
overpowers
and
then
pure
bitterness
toasted
malts
taste
more
like
burnt
malts
this
imperial
porter
is
not
your
everyday
drink
its
demanding
and
unruly
barrelaged
or
ridiculously
overthetop
porters
and
stouts
are
the
order
of
the
day
for
edgy
american
breweries
but
for
their
signature
series
shipyard
has
opted
to
go
a
more
traditional
domesticated
route
and
they
did
well
at
it
this
strikes
a
great
balance
between
on
one
end
of
the
scale
familiarity
and
on
the
other
excessiveness
an
easy
one
to
recommend

shipyards
imperial
porter
is
one
of
the
most
bipolar
beers
ive
ever
reviewed
it
looks
amazing
and
definitely
tastes
pretty
good
but
the
weak
aroma
and
thin
fizzy
mouthfeel
do
not
help
this
beers
case
at
all
i
still
have
to
give
this
stuff
a
thumbs
up
but
the
aforementioned
flaws
prevent
it
from
being
a
truly
memorable
imperial
porter
there
are
local
options
wellington
ris
and
grand
rivers
russian
gun
that
are
more
affordable
and
equally
satisfying
so
this
is
not
something
i
am
likely
to
repurchase
not
an
amazing
deal
at
its
lcbo
price
point
but
potentially
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
changeup
too
much
char
for
my
taste
too
onedimensional
o

and
bold
definitely
glad
my
ba
in

decided
to
include
this
one

posseses

try
again
almost
perfect
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
wish
is
had
more
alcohol
being
an
imperial
porter
but
thats
picking
nits
excellent
beer
pretty
amazing
strong
dark
and
tasty
o
a
really
good
porter
i
would
recommend
and
buy
whenever
i
can
overall
this
is
a
nice
porter
worth
a
try
o
dont
think
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
again
not
bad
but
there
are
better
options
overall
a
nice
imperial
porter
a
little
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
little
less
carbonation
would
make
this
a
much
better
porter
the
body
lacks
the
fullness
and
depth
of
some
finnish
polish
and
swedish
baltic
porters
but
it
is
a
really
enjoyable
brew
anyway
a
damn
fine
beer
well
balanced
flavorful
hides
its
booze
well
and
is
quite
drinkable
a
repeat
coming
in
my
future
throughout
the
cold
winter
nights
d
this
was
not
a
bad
porter
but
the
scent
and
taste
werent
great
and
the
body
was
weak
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
but
it
wasnt
really
exciting
to
drink
either
not
recommended
this
was
a
refreshing
reminder
that
imperial
portersstouts
neednt
be
off
the
wall
and
full
of
chocolatevanillachilebourbonetc
to
be
good
decent
little
imp
porter
a
slightly
bolder
body
and
a
touch
more
rounded
sweetness
would
help
immensely
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
a
little
syrupy
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
i
didnt
really
think
it
was
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
the
buttery
caramel
flavors
were
just
overdone
for
me
and
not
that
enjoyable
the
roasty
chocolaty
porter
characteristics
just
seemed
overshadowed
which
didnt
work
well
for
me
very
dark
with
just
a
faint
mahogany
edge
visible
a
gentle
pour
produced
a
couple
inches
of
fluffy
tan
foam
much
more
than
expected
good
head
retention
a
bit
of
clumpy
lacing
lots
of
dark
malts
in
the
aroma
burnt
and
chocolate
nutty
and
malted
milk
mild
caramel
and
a
hint
of
smoke
plenty
going
on
in
the
flavour
building
from
a
malty
base
of
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
of
fruity
cherries
and
licorice
mild
vanilla
slight
roast
in
addition
to
the
burnt
malts
medium
bodied
with
moderateplus
carbonation
mild
astringency
from
the
dark
malts
and
faint
alcohol
spiciness
overall
it
was
quite
nice
but
would
have
been
better
with
carbonation
a
bit
lower
where
do
i
get
the
goldfoiltipped
pen
pugsley
uses
on
these
labels
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
russet
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
toasted
caramel
very
light
coffee
and
a
touch
of
seared
wood
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
stronger
charvinyl
character
along
with
some
deep
molasses
notes
something
tells
me
they
overdid
it
a
bit
on
the
black
patent
malts
here
this
character
tends
toward
the
astringent
and
kinda
ruins
the
whole
experience
for
me
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
mostly
solid
porter
but
that
astringency
holds
it
back
significantly
beyond
that
though
pretty
good
not
bad
but
there
are
too
many
other
porters
i
will
seek
out
over
this
one
in
the
future
o
all
in
all
a
nice
porter
the
nose
could
use
some
work
and
ive
had
better
flavors
but
this
is
quite
nice
and
is
possibly
the
creamiest
porter
ive
ever
had
overall
it
is
a
fine
beer
nicely
roasted
malts
could
be
a
fuller
mouthfeel
but
overall
is
a
nice
beer
i
gave
this
a
vigorous
pour
into
a
nonic
glass
came
out
dark
opaque
and
black
in
dim
lighting
with
a
tremendous
bit
of
roast
on
the
nose
body
is
thin
and
creamy
with
some
sweet
and
tart
notes
that
remind
me
of
a
milk
stout
its
not
a
big
and
boozy
as
i
remember
it
being
but
this
might
be
due
to
the
fact
that
im
drinking
a
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
march
2011
and
its
mid
september
or
maybe
i
just
remember
it
differently
as
the
last
one
i
had
was
towards
the
end
of
winter
all
in
all
its
a
solid
porter
while
i
wouldnt
suggest
cellaring
it
for
years
and
years
i
think
its
held
up
nicely
over
the
last
9
months
poured
from
a
bomber
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
brown
coloring
with
some
chestnut
highlights
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
ton
of
light
tan
head
at
first
but
it
quickly
settled
into
a
thin
film
of
dense
head
aromas
are
slightly
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
slight
booze
characteristic
the
beers
flavors
are
more
coffee
centric
with
a
good
balance
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
highlight
of
milk
chocolate
very
complex
and
well
blended
bitter
from
the
coffee
and
from
hops
hit
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
cleaning
everything
up
nicely
no
cling
on
the
glass
and
the
beer
tends
to
be
standard
for
the
porter
style
with
a
thin
light
body
overall
the
aftertaste
is
heavy
on
the
bitters
with
highlights
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
lacing
through
the
finish
is
slick
at
first
and
then
dry
through
the
end
very
strong
robust
flavors
but
not
overpowering
or
offputting
extremely
tasty
brew
overall
the
beer
is
pleasant
to
drink
just
not
in
the
style
advertise
it
was
somewhat
closer
to
a
scotch
ale
o
very
drinkable
but
thinner
than
i
hoped
after
the
beautiful
pour
just
does
not
compare
to
any
bas
maybe
an
unfair
comparison
as
it
is
not
ba
and
is
a
porter
but
is
what
i
have
come
to
expect
when
i
see
that
coloring
d
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
feel
and
it
delivers
on
the
abv
end
making
it
a
nice
imperial
style
beer
o
pretty
good
a
solid

good
for

pretty
much
exactly
what
i
want
from
the
style
o
great
beer
but
a
little
deceptive
overall
another
dark
beer
tending
toward
the
even
to
slightly
hoppy
side
good
but
i
prefer
to
lean
the
other
way
this
might
be
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
ever
had
at
least
the
best
nonbarrel
aged
one
ive
had
just
a
really
really
well
crafted
beer
this
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
smuttynose
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
petty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
baltic
porter
and
it
didnt
have
any
off
flavors
and
anything
that
didnt
fit
into
the
style
and
it
made
for
a
tasty
baltic
porter
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
slightly
sticky
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
would
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
rule
out
drinking
two
but
that
would
be
my
limit
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
a
very
true
example
of
the
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
i
thought
it
could
have
a
little
more
head
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
baltic
porter
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
or
dark
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
had
all
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
in
the
end
it
was
just
a
tasty
baltic
porter
its
one
of
the
better
smuttynose
beers
ive
had
and
its
one
of
the
better

had

point
overall
great
but
too
expensive
o
tremendous
effort
with
a
very
big
bold
brew
that
manages
to
deliver
imperial
stout
flavors
via
the
distinct
style
of
the
baltic
porter
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
foamy
13
and
otherwise
smooth
23
mouthfeel
that
is
appropriate
for
a
sipping
beer
and
this
style
in
general
closes
dry
with
heavy
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
and
lips
black
covered
by
a
creamy
looking
patchy
head
rich
dark
fruit
and
bread
aromas
with
a
bit
of
oxidation
from
age
raisins
prunes
figs
molasses
and
port
becoming
increasingly
chocolaty
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
big
malty
flavors
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
dry
roast
and
some
vinous
fruit
silky
smooth
somewhat
oily
with
a
light
acidity
nutty
creamy
malt
and
some
char
fullish
yet
fluffy
in
the
mouth
really
excellent
as
it
warms
and
starts
to
open
up
o
drinkability
is
right
where
it
should
be
very
nice
overall
this
beer
is
big
tastes
great
and
has
tons
of
character
overall
i
might
need
to
grab
another
bottle
this
stuff
is
nice
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
ive
had
really
hits
all
the
marks
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
this
is
a
big
porter
loaded
with
flavor
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
pairs
well
with
the
big
flavors
and
the
multidimensions
of
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
one
a
standard
for
the
style
o
bordering
on
too
richdoesnt
cross
the
line
a
full
hefty
porter
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
alot
of
similarities
with
their
imperial
stout
in
my
opinion
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
and
its
extremely
enjoyable
recommended
a
truly
exceptional
beer
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
try
to
imagine
the
perfect
baltic
porter
very
complex
yet
perfectly
balanced
a
liquid
dream
overall
smuttynose
killed
it
with
this
one
epitomizes
what
a
baltic
porter
should
taste
like
o
this
is
a
big
beer
and
a
sipping
beer
even
though
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
lots
of
complexity
and
richness
to
the
flavors
of
this
beer
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
pours
a
total
eclipse
jet
black
with
huge
persistent
head
aroma
of
figs
raisins
and
rumsoaked
fruit
cake
taste
is
a
blast
of
sweet
rum
soaked
figs
and
prunes
with
a
strong
lingering
burnt
wood
finish
the
alcohol
has
a
strong
presence
but
is
overcome
by
the
roasted
wood
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
a
good
pick
when
your
taste
buds
are
compromised
o
very
nice
beer
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
stout
to
me
wonderfully
combines
roast
chocolate
dark
fruit
flavors
very
well
done
od
a
nice
baltic
porter
tasty
and
nice
to
sip
complexity
was
good
but
didnt
go
the
extra
mile
but
the
beer
was
enjoyable
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
incredible
beer
it
balances
sweetness
has
that
interesting
fruit
note
but
also
cleans
off
well
with
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
truly
a
world
class
beer
big
is
an
appropriate
word
for
this
really
a
nice
porter
to
add
to
any
lineup
as
always
priced
to
move
6
99
for
22
oz
bottle
o
4
5
a
very
strong
beer
smells
rich
and
there
is
hint
of
chocolate
coffee
and
cherries
pours
very
thick
and
dark
black
the
color
of
coffee
the
head
of
the
beer
was
thick
and
very
brown
the
taste
is
good
and
very
flavorable
and
thick
when
tasted
worth
trying
o
a
nice
complex
and
well
balanced
baltic
porter
good
variety
of
flavors
and
they
complement
each
other
nicely
im
not
a
fan
of
smoky
beers
but
this
one
has
some
well
integrated
smoke
this
is
up
there
with
surly
smoke
and
alaskan
baltic
porter
t
opens
with
a
rich
blend
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
mocha
fudge
and
dark
chocolate
come
in
the
middle
with
a
finish
thats
roasty
and
a
touch
bitter
and
laced
with
tobacco
blackberry
and
dark
bread
this
was
as
strong
as
needed
to
be
but
i
wouldnt
want
it
to
be
any
weaker
as
well
polishing
off
one
of
these
was
easy
and
given
the
time
id
easily
buy
this
again
theres
no
doubt
as
to
why
this
is
the
highestrated
beer
from
smuttynose
and
for
any
porter
stout
or
dark
ale
fan
this
is
musthave
really
great
stuff
overall
really
impressed
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
lot
and
was
not
let
down
looks
great
smells
delicious
bold
flavors
you
cant
ask
for
much
more
overall
brewed
well
in
my
opinion
there
are
a
lot
of
flavours
that
come
together
in
a
way
that
i
havent
had
in
a
lot
of
porters
its
a
bit
too
sweet
which
im
ok
with
but
its
really
the
dry
boozy
feel
of
this
beer
that
turns
me
off
on
it
for
the
price
i
think
itd
be
a
nice
experiment
to
have
a
second
one
to
age
but
having
it
a
few
months
fresh
like
i
did
was
not
the
experience
i
expected
4
do
this
otherwisegood
porter
is
diminished
considerably
by
the
extent
to
which
tasted
and
felt
acidity
is
present
like
other
high
gravity
dark
beers
with
similar
failings
the
mood
is
turned
a
bit
schizophrenic
by
the
acidity
that
simultaneously
sends
heavy
flavors
scattering
and
sears
the
palate
o
vanilla
and
coffee
heavy
nice
baltic
porter
that
drinks
really
easy
overall
really
good
beer
though
a
bit
boozy
for
being
only
9
8
definitely
worth
picking
up
now
but
id
also
be
interested
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
drink
i
can
see
why
this
was
in
the
top
250
a
good
beer
for
the
style
with
semi
good
balance
large
aromas
and
flavors
and
warms
on
a
cold
ca
night
nice
porter
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
my
preferences
but
excellent
complexity
and
flavor
would
do
better
with
some
balance
on
the
sweetness
side
o
rich
and
full
in
ingredients
this
beer
needs
to
age
to
let
the
alcohol
integrate
into
them
and
mellow
it
out
a
drink
to
warm
your
tummy
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
next
couple
of
these
i
find
are
going
to
be
laid
down
for
a
couple
of
years
to
see
if
thats
what
can
turn
this
promise
of
a
delicious
brew
into
an
actual
one
if
it
does
this
is
easily
a
beer
that
will
score
well
into
the
4s
the
components
are
clearly
there
they
just
need
more
time
to
come
together
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
thick
browntoblack
coloring
with
a
frothy
dense
light
brown
colored
head
that
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
layering
pours
thick
aromas
of
roast
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
hint
of
old
world
fruit
sweetness
flavors
are
rich
and
bold
with
a
solid
dose
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
rich
sweetness
of
raisins
and
dates
the
coffee
character
is
there
but
it
takes
a
backseat
to
this
one
there
is
a
touch
of
heat
from
the
increased
abv
but
it
helps
to
enhance
and
balance
the
flavor
profiles
very
smooth
in
mouth
with
a
transition
to
a
clean
dry
finish
very
well
made
brew
roasted
and
slightly
boozey
aftertaste
with
a
mocha
twist
this
is
a
great
beer
o
solid
brew
im
not
an
expert
on
the
style
but
i
didnt
find
this
as
anything
special
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
enjoyed
it
but
the
carbonation
and
acid
taste
take
away
from
what
should
be
a
mellow
experience
a
complex
beer
needs
balance
to
broaden
its
complexity
this
beer
achieves
this
balance
smuttynose
is
an
excellent
brewer
i
have
never
had
a
mediocre
beer
from
the
brewery
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
the
brewery
i
may
buy
another
bottle
to
cellar
roasted
malt
and
coffee
bitterness
up
front
dark
fruits
and
milk
chocolate
sweetness
fills
up
the
palate
cocoa
nib
bitterness
and
licorice
mix
in
light
notes
of
malted
milk
and
caramel
woody
herbal
hop
bitterness
comes
on
toward
the
finish
and
mixes
with
the
roasted
coffee
nicely
very
nice
mediumfull
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
i
have
had
pours
a
deep
black
with
tan
head
looks
more
like
a
barrel
aged
stout
awesome
barrel
alcohol
booze
and
roasted
malt
aroma
slight
chocolate
taste
is
very
boozey
bourbon
barrel
with
roasted
bitter
and
slight
chocolate
notes
i
cant
believe
this
hast
been
barrel
aged
its
awesome
well
worth
the
sub
6
price
tag
the
finish
was
clean
just
as
the
initial
taste
so
from
beginning
to
end
tis
beer
was
so
very
nice
start
to
end
o
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
for
the
style
didnt
expect
the
full
rich
mouthfeel
and
was
delightfully
surprised
this
one
is
great
right
out
the
gate
and
i
can
see
this
one
aging
beautifully
a
musttry
one
of
the
few
from
the
big
beer
series
that
i
actually
enjoy
i
love
plenty
of
their
regular
offerings
but
have
found
many
from
this
series
ho
hum
and
bland
however
this
is
very
good
and
recommended
o
really
nice
a
special
beer
if
its
firing
on
this
many
cylinders
after
2
years
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
ive
had
this
one
and
uintas
sea
legs
relatively
recently
and
while
i
think
i
like
sea
legs
a
bit
more
smuttynoses
offering
is
quite
obviously
more
robust
than
unitas
a
dynamite
baltic
you
cant
see
thru
this
you
cant
opaque
as
the
pants
i
wore
to
my
wedding
heres
the
kicker
in
tow
the
head
doesnt
pretend
to
be
white
straight
deep
brown
smell
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
porter
toffee
coffee
dark
taste
simply
cannot
be
written
home
concerning
tasty
yes
notable
surely
not
mouthfeel
just
aint
porter
carbon
conquers
cream
i
wont
admit
this
is
a
poor
beer
but
it
doesnt
hang
with
superior
porters
o
very
good
porter
nice
roastiness
with
enough
sweetness
to
balance
it
nicely
overall
absolutely
fantastic
baltic
porter
and
beer
in
general
i
love
this
beer
the
only
other
baltic
ive
had
that
comes
close
to
this
is
sinebrychoff
and
thats
a
tad
hard
to
find
around
me
ill
also
add
that
this
beer
is
extremely
cheap
just
under
6
bucks
for
a
bomber
if
you
see
this
or
sinebrychoff
and
want
to
know
how
some
classic
baltics
taste
you
know
what
to
do
o
big
beer
series
is
aptly
named
the
flavor
is
bold
the
gravity
is
high
and
the
alcohol
is
loud
you
need
to
be
a
fan
of
porters
to
enjoy
this
beer
its
all
about
sweet
and
charred
malt
flavors
overall
quite
a
delicious
brew
medium
sweetness
with
a
thick
body
and
a
nice
roasted
flavor
profile
a
very
nice
cool
weather
sipping
brew
overall
typically
i
disregard
smutty
nose
because
ive
had
to
many
bad
beers
by
them
this
is
just
a
really
solid
baltic
porter
though
its
a
little
boozy
but
i
have
another
bottle
im
aging
until
next
winter
where
i
expect
an
even
better
version
if
this
brew
o
interesting
not
bad
but
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
a
baltic
porter
cheers
pours
a
thick
dark
black
with
a
dense
mocha
head
that
fades
to
a
thick
collar
and
wispy
streaks
of
lace
nose
of
caramel
malt
licorice
bakers
chocolate
pine
and
brown
sugar
medium
thick
moderate
carbonation
full
on
palate
with
a
sweet
sticky
finish
flavor
is
sweeter
than
expected
more
chocolate
licorice
raisin
rich
malt
and
only
trace
bitterness
on
backend
finish
also
still
has
a
little
warming
booze
in
the
finish
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
seeks
this
one
out
again
a
flavor
bomb
for
about
6
bucks
i
would
love
to
live
in
the
north
east
for
the
beer
selection
unfortunately
i
live
in
utah
o
this
one
is
damn
near
perfect
for
me
this
is
my
first
offering
by
smuttynose
and
this
one
is
very
well
done
the
big
foamy
head
that
never
seems
to
dissipate
the
amazing
balance
of
its
components
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
great
and
the
abv
is
spot
on
for
this
brew
o
a
fantastic
interpretation
of
the
style
with
all
the
flavor
booze
and
body
that
you
want
well
done
smutty
a
nearly
pitchperfect
example
of
a
baltic
porter
great
balance
of
sweet
and
smoky
this
is
a
monster
of
a
porter
super
flavorful
and
complex
im
really
digging
this
o
vrooom
vroooom
whats
that
i
just
ran
to
my
local
store
to
strip
the
shelves
of
the
best
baltic
porter
ever
made
try
this
and
you
will
agree
a
combination
darkened
fruit
and
caramel
tones
make
for
a
great
treat
in
the
winter
time
in
the
northeast
or
summertime
of
the
northeast
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
ebony
head

fades
quickly
smells
of
coffee
raisins
and
hints
of
chocolate
malts
are
also
noted
taste
is
quite
smooth
for
the
alcohol
content
of
this
nice
hints
of
dark
fruits
with
a
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
overall
a
nice

after
dinner

good
as
any
baltic
porter
ive
had
smuttys

plenty
have
said
it
already
about
smuttys
baltic
porter
and
i
have
to
agree
with
them
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
it
has
virtually
no
flawsan
excellent
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
looks
great
in
the
glass
impressive
and
imposing
but
dont
be
intimidated

it
if
you
stumble
upon
it
at
your
local
store
this
was
damn
good
a
big
beer
that
really
packs
a
wallop
o
rich
sweet
chocolaty
porter
great
dessert
beer
very
drinkable
very
pleasant
id
love
to
get
another
bottle
and
the
bottle
art
was
pretty
cool
too
palate
is
oily
and
warm
mediumfull
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
finishes
fairly
dry
maybe
a
touch
lighter
and
bubblier
than
id
have
wanted
but
pretty
tasty
overall
o
sounds
like
this
beer
should
be
somewhere
between
the
and
english
porter
and
a
russian
stout
flavor
imitates
geography
well
id
say
this
beer
hits
that
mark
pretty
spoton
it
was
like
a
slightly
lighter
imperial
stout
slightly
more
on
the
dry
rather
than
sweet
side
wow
what
a
great
baltic
porter
nice
and
dark
and
rich
in
appearance
smells
great
like
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
the
flavors
mimic
the
nose
with
a
light
touch
of
char
nice
coffee
not
too
much
and
a
wonderful
vanillachocolate
taste
super
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
as
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
it
i
will
be
going
back
to
get
a
couple
more
to
enjoy
overall
extreme
smooth
drinkable
and
tasty
a
fine
treat
one
of
my
favorite
porters
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
baltic
porter
i
didnt
enjoy
but
this
one
is
truly
wonderful
decent
price
as
well
overall
this
is
just
about
a
perfect
beer
sadly
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
baltic
porters
but
if
this
is
any
indication
its
a
marvelous
style
for
such
a
dark
heavy
beer
its
amazingly
drinkable
and
refreshing
bravo
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasty
malt
and
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
roast
and
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
o
glad
to
have
tried
it
fresh
i
look
forward
to
try
it
aged
as
i
have
a
bottle
from
last
year
as
well
od
this
one
is
great
the
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
bitterness
is
among
some
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
assume
its
pretty
representative
of
the
style
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
have
no
good
reason
as
to
why
i
never
drank
this
but
didnt
realize
it
had
such
a
good
score
until
i
came
to
type
in
my
review
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
just
be
an
average
porter
but
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
ive
had
looks
great
has
a
near
perfect
mouthfeel
and
has
a
ton
going
on
in
the
taste
not
sure
how
much
aging
it
helped
as
it
is
probably
1
52
years
old
at
this
point
but
its
drinking
near
perfect
as
normal
nonbarrel
aged
baltic
porters
go
still
like
dark
knight
and
bba
shipwreck
the
best
this
might
be
the
best
one
ive
had
i
like
it
more
than
the
ølfabrikken
porter
would
like
to
have
it
again
o
definitely
a
sipper
kind
of
wonder
if
a
year
of
aging
would
even
things
out
in
this
one
a
bit
overpowering
but
maybe
its
what
a
true
baltic
porter
should
be
o
a
very
flavorful
version
of
the
style
all
flavors
are
there
in
balance
and
seem
to
be
highlighted
nicely
o
pretty
much
perefect
inviting
from
start
to
finish
and
a
very
sublime
brew
it
falls
just
short
of
perfection
in
its
complexity
but
makes
up
for
it
in
its
awesome
ability
to
perform
exactly
what
i
think
the
brewers
wanted
it
to
a
sublimely
rich
and
smooth
baltic
porter
i
would
buy
this
again
as
it
is
so
easy
to
appreciate
this
well
made
brew
overall
what
a
great
tasting
brew
maybe
not
the
most
mind
blowing
but
an
excellent
beer
i
would
have
again
anytime
over
many
others
dino
hooked
this
up
in
our
trade

colored
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
throughout
when
held
to

the
edges
are

the

is
a
rich
blend
of
roasted

coffee
chocolate
with
hints
of
vanilla
no

detected
smells
great
similarly
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
roasted

and
coffee
flavors
immediately
the
chocolate
vanilla
and
malty
sweetness
soon
follows
are
present
a
full

and
enjoyable

supreme
excellent

no

finishes
with
a
mildly
sweet

not
overly
so
flavor
with
a
mild
bitterness
of
the
tongue
overall
to
say
this
was
a
treat
is
an
understatement
best
baltic
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
smuttynose
robust
porter
is
one
of
the
best
american
porters
ive
ever
had
i
guess
it
makes
sense
that
smuttynose
baltic
porter
is
similarly
great
i
should
age

of

are

mouthfeel
is

slightly
peppery
alcohol
is

and
this
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
o
damn
fine
brew
here
with
great
taste
and
balance
sweet
but
not
cloying
my
favorite
baltic
to
date
must
get
more
go
get
em
overall
solid
all
around
the
water
makes
it
unique
big
without
being
over
the
top
in
any
way
nicely
balanced
overall
i
need
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
beer
on
an
annual
basis
for
nights
such
as
this
its
really
an
excellent
beer
and
receives
all
of
the
accolades
it
has
received
on
this
site
excellent
all
around
and
the
only
thing
that
could
foreseeably
slow
anyone
down
is
the
weight
but
thats
what
i
want
in
a
beer
that
has
a
father
timegrim
reaper
that
looks
like
its
going
to
kidnap
the
child
on
the
label
overall
definitely
a
big
porter
but
lacks
some
of
the
complex
dark
fruit
flavors
evident
in
the
classic
examples
a
nicely
made
beer
but
a
bit
off
style
wise
the
nose
is
not
very
strong
at
all
the
flavor
profile
includes
a
mild
chocolate
flavor
with
some
dark
fruits
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
coffee
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
nearly
as
roasty
as
i
would
like
but
a
solid
effort
nonetheless
this
is
definitely
a
winner
a
musttry
if
you
havent
yet
think
ill
buy
23
more
and
cellar
for
a
few
years
if
i
can
wait
that
long
o
a
great
baltic
porter
the
roasted
and
fruity
flavors
are
done
very
well
this
is
a
really
delicious
beer
notes
this
beer
is
one
of
my
top
25
personal
favorites
i
cant
praise
it
enough
no
hype
just
a
great
beer
at
a
great
price
6
bomber
with
wide
distribution
an
absolute
musttry
one
of
my
personal
favorite
tasting
porters
for
what
its
worth
this
is
an
incredible
beer
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
and
was
pleased
to
do
so
well
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
solid
beer
indeed
also
a
great
value
at
5
99
for
the
bomber
im
not
sure
i
like
this
as
much
as
some
but
ill
definitely
drink
this
again
o
awesome
brew
from
smuttynose
quintessential
baltic
porter
different
flavor
profile
from
ris
more
hops
less
roasted
highly
reccomended
would
love
to
do
a
vertical
with
a
few
of
these
and
see
how
it
ages
must
buy
lingering
sherry
notes
on
the
palate
very
easy
to
drink
throughout
complex
beer
but
still
very
approachable
and
delicious
o
cant
believe
this
beer
is
so
good
and
affordable
at
the
same
time
love
this
one
i
want
to
brush
my
teeth
with
it
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
had
it
on
draft
a
the
capital
alehouse
in
fredricksburg
after
a
night
of
inventory
at
total
wine
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
d
really
nice
this
has
obviously
aged
well
and
the
raisin
and
sherry
notes
only
add
to
the
complexity
of
an
already
dense
beer
overall
not
too
bad
thick
like
most
baltics
and
fairly
drinkable
a
little
oily
in
the
finish
overall
an
excellent
product
i
am
new
to
the
new
england
breweries
but
this
is
the
best
regional
brew
i
have
had
to
date
highly
recommend
it
cheers
outstanding
must
try
great
stuff
wow
this
is
one
amazing
beer
from
smuttynose
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
brownish
highlights
a
nice
chocolate
milk
colored
head
tops
the
brew
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
an
enticing
bouquet
of
roasted
porter
goodness
with
a
nice
dose
of
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
pretty
bitter
but
still
rich
with
dark
chocolate
and
lots
of
fruits
and
nuts
the
mouthfeel
is
a
soft
yet
full
and
rich
the
perfect
baltic
porter
oanother
great
baltic
porter
not
as
good
as
the
long
trail
but
marginally
so
the
beers
got
an
incredible
price
5
9922oz
bomber
and
it
isnt
ridiculously
overhyped
so
ill
actually
be
able
to
grab
it
off
shelves
count
on
more
being
there
next
week
profound
concept
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
already
plan
on
getting
a
few
more
bottles
myself
all
in
all
a
wonderful
beer
and
one
of
the
best
porters
you
can
get
for
a
great
price
5

for
a

d
the

body
and
somewhat
masked
abv
make
this
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
generally
nurse
my
big
stoutsporters
but
i
found
myself
almost
gulping
this
down
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
im
glad
i
got
this
one
because
it
was
a
random
pickup
i
would
buy
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
it
would
go
great
with
some
grilled
steaks
or
something
very
tasty
pours
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
brown
head
with
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
it
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
little
roast
as
well
as
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
light
smoke
faint
hint
of
a
hop
finish
medium
to
full
body
delicious
so
far
my
favorite
of
the
big
beer
series
although
this
is
only
my
3rd
one
poured
into
a
20
oz
duvel
tulip
glass
poured
slowly
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
and
got
a
huge
four
inch
dark
tan
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
dark
chocolate
leather
raisins
tobacco
and
coffee
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
each
of
the
flavors
in
the
nose
very
big
flavors
but
nothing
dominates
body
is
thick
and
creamy
like
no
other
porter
i
have
ever
had
plenty
of
life
on
the
dry
side
and
drinkable
for
a
large
abv
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
must
try
if
you
love
porters
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
of
the
style
it
had
lots
of
flavors
coming
out
in
it
but
managed
to
bring
everything
together
nicely
excellent
beer
overall
odsmuttynoses
beers
are
up
and
down
with
me
some
of
their
big
beer
series
i
really
wasnt
a
fan
of
however
this
company
knows
how
to
brew
some
seriously
awesome
porters
this
is
up
there
with
finest
kind
ipa
as
the
best
of
their
beers
big
complex
rich
and
delicious
great
beer
and
at
5
75
a
22
oz
this
is
a
relative
deal
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
baltic
elements
are
just
enough
to
earn
the
name
it
could
almost
land
in
the
imperial
stout
zone
i
look
forward
to
having
some
and
would
lay
some
down
annually
if
i
had
the
chance
tasted
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
complex
fruitiness
and
bitter
chocolate
very
thick
mouthfeel
with
sweet
smooth
finish
one
of
the
best
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
one
is
excellent
for
drinkability
none
of
the
flavors
overwhelmed
and
the
complexity
along
with
the
dry
finish
invites
one
to
take
another
sip
and
then
another
sip
ill
certainly
be
looking
for
more
of
this
beer
in
the
future
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
that
is
very
well
made
and
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
it
has
earned
its
high
ratings
taste
has
roasted
coffee
creamy
dark
and
milk
chocolate
and
red
cherry
notes
dark
fruits
underneath
alcohol
isnt
noticed
as
it
warms
and
thins
a
bit
the
chocolate
fades
into
the
background
leaving
a
somewhat
bitter
roasty
finish
excellent
example
of
the
style
o
a
really
rich
and
bold
sipper
great
complex
flavors
and
very
smooth
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
solid
solid
imperial
porter
great
flavors
balanced
with
lots
of
complexity
the
flavor
profile
really
moves
from
beginning
to
end
as
well
the
look
is
no
better
than
average
and
the
feel
could
definitely
use
some
beefing
up
but
otherwise
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
thanks
again
guys
for
doing
the
legwork
recommended
o
a
good
baltic
porter
not
outstanding
but
solid
a
tad
overcarbonated
but
not
too
bad
this
lived
up
to
my
expectations
and
am
happy
i
have
a
couple
more
to
enjoy
taste
is
medicinal
when
cold
moxie
amaretto
hazelnut
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
coffee
beans
as
it
warms
fruitcake
fermented
raisins
and
more
coffee
sharply
carbonated
greasy
mouthfeel
dry
finish
doesnt
linger
on
the
palate
clearly
a
porter
not
one
that
blurs
the
lines
between
a
porter
and
a
stout
pours
black
color
with
a
large
frothy
brown
head
that
was
lasting
with
excellent
lacing
heavy
toasted
dark
chocolate

and
dark
fruit
aroma
medium
to
full

with
a
thick
smooth
texture
and
flat
carbonation
heavy
toasted
sweet
malt
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
finish
of
long
duration
this
is
a
standout
porter
di
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
couldnt
get
past
the
very
overwhelming
roasted
bitterness
o
smuttynoses
baltic
porter
is
a
classically
rustic
presentation
of
the
style
its
well
done
though
i
bet
this
would
be
even
better
on
a
nitrotap
overall
really
tasty
beer
from
smuttynose
i
love
baltic
porters
and
this
beer
is
better
than
average
cheers
o
this
beer
was
a
surprise
to
me
really
complex
the
aroma
was
slightly
better
than
what
it
actually
tasted
like
solid
porter
but
not
one
i
would
revisit
any
time
soon
o
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
perfectly
balanced
and
100
traditional
porter
great
stuff
o
a
great
baltic
porter
wish
i
had
picked
up
some
more
while
it
was
still
around
this
is
a
tad
sweeter
than
im
used
to
but
a
little
heat
made
this
beer
much
better
damn
fine
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
this
is
a
pretty
big
beer
with
a
nice
alcohol
component
that
really
worked
the
booze
helped
smooth
out
some
of
the
roast
and
more
harsh
flavors
to
bring
everything
together
for
the
value
5
99
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
awhile
though
it
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
some
of
its
imperial
stout
brethren
this
was
by
far
the
best
baltic
porter
i
have
had
drinkability
its
a
really
great
beer
and
a
reasonable
value
maybe
a
bit
too
big
dark
hoppy
and
roasty
for
style
but
im
no
expert
ive
found
precious
little
to
fault
with
this
beer
and
as
with
really
old
brown
dog
im
ashamed
for
having
passed
on
it
so
many
times
highly
recommended
na
zdravje
pours
almost
black
with
a
brown
head
initially
towering
above
the
beer
with
massive
bubbles
which
eventually
settle
big
fat
lacing
and
a
creamy
head
is
retained
nose
holds
some
chocolate
caramel
light
brown
sugar
thats
pleasant
and
understated
taste
echoes
the
nose
with
some
velvety
milk
chocolate
some
roastiness
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
creamy
relatively
full
with
no
alcohol
detectable
i
love
the
balance
and
contrast
between
the
brown
sugar
and
sweetness
with
the
roastiness
in
this
one
it
just
feels
great
quite
impressed
for
picking
this
up
on
a
whim
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
first
glass
of
this
excellent
baltic
porter
not
surprisingly
it
was
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
finish
the
bomber
i
wish
i
had
a
friend
or
two
around
with
which
to
share
this
big
and
rich
porter
pours
a
black
really
black
huge
head
mocha
colored
bubbles
cascade
down
glass
scent
is
not
huge
not
like
i
expected
subdued
tastes
like
the
crust
of
an
artisan
black
bread
roasted
malts
but
that
bready
flavor
keeps
coming
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
youd
expect
not
bad
overall
really
nice
porter
o
really
quite
good
i
like
the
acidity
which
ostensibly
comes
from
stale
grains
if
this
is
a
quintessential
baltic
porter
i
want
more
overall
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
too
much
molasses
flavor
but
otherwise
spot
on
d
great
drinking
porter
strong
but
you
dont
realize
it
when
youre
drinking
it
wish
this
came
in
12oz
bottles
a
great
beer
but
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
much
in
my
opinion
so
it
may
improve
with
some
age
on
it
but
either
way
really
good
stuff
excellent
im
going
to
be
sipping
on
this
bomber
and
loving
it
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
serious
head
of
beige
foam
the
aromatics
are
rather
smoky
with
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
soap
in
the
background
the
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
there
is
a
moderate
mixture
of
smoke
and
roast
i
actually
detect
a
bit
of
lactose
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
distinct
soured
milk
flavor
is
actually
rather
welcome
with
the
roast
in
this
version
of
the
style
i
like
this
beer
i
find
it
to
be
very
good
this
isnt
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
in
the
past
i
do
however
think
that
there
is
something
missing
here
and
i
dont
know
what
that
is
this
beer
is
close
to
being
great
but
its
not
there
yet
d
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
the
taste
is
just
amazing
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
was
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
definitely
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
i
dont
think
youll
be
disappointed
cheers
baltic
porter
is
easily
one
of
smuttynoses
finest
beers
im
actually
a
little
surprised
that
its
as
good
as
it
is
its
chock
full
of
explosive
flavor
and
delivers
in
just
about
every
way
the
nose
could
use
a
little
more
volume
but
thats
really
my
only
complaint
overall
its
an
easydrinking
delicious
beer
highly
recommended
pours
black
with
a
onefinger
brown
head
quickly
goes
away
aroma
of
espresso
beans
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
nice
big
roasted
malts
to
start
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
pick
up
in
the
body
a
nice
cream
flavor
as
well
dark
fruits
and
an
acidic
note
to
a
lesser
extent
dry
hops
give
this
beer
a
pretty
quick
finish
big
tasting
baltic
porter
and
very
well
constructed
says
bottle
conditioned
in
2009
so
i
guess
its
2
years
old
thanks
to
schreibeers
for
the
trade
pours
pretty
much
black
with
thin
tan
head
smell
up
front
is
coffee
and
chocolate
a
hint
of
caramel
and
maybe
something
fruity
the
taste
is
great
coffee
chocolate
not
to
much
carbonation
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
truly
a
great
beer
d
an
amazing
and
highly
addictive
porter
ive
had
plenty
of
porters
that
were
concentrated
on
the
roastiness
side
this
dark
fruit
character
makes
you
want
to
drink
plenty
flavor
mouthfeel
aroma
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
drink
is
good
light
booze
little
sticky
nice
bitterness
d
very
drinkable
beer
and
probably
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
to
date
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
with
no
unpleasant
aftertastes
or
strong
alcohol
burn
overall
an
amazing
beer
overall
i
love
to
savor
this
for
as
long
as
i
can
since
we
dont
get
it
around
here
this
is
probably
my
favorite
baltic
porter
i
can
not
get
enough
of
this
have
to
get
more
poured
from
a
bomber
into
my
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
thick
mocha
color
head
the
smell
is
roasty
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
close
with
the
dark
fruits
being
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
than
the
smell
this
beer
has
a
full
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
and
i
have
never
tried
it
until
now
its
a
real
sleeper
as
most
people
would
likely
walk
by
it
but
dont
buy
2
today
and
drink
one
now
and
cellar
one
as
i
will
be
cellaring
a
few
to
see
how
they
are
with
some
age
on
them
they
definitely
seem
like
they
could
improve
with
age
md
full
bodied
beer
the
body
is
heavier
then
most
porters
more
stout
like
slight
prickle
from
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
drinkablity
of
this
beer
is
also
more
like
an
imperial
stout
then
a
porter
one
of
these
is
enough
this
is
a
good
nightcap
or
dessert
beer
and
not
really
sessionable
full
bodied
a
little
rough
at
first
but
goes
down
smooth
n
alcohol
provides
a
warming
kick
at
the
end
overall
a
decent
strong
porter
for
a
cold
and
windy
winter
night
such
as
this
black
beauty
with
a
brown
head
on
her
shoulders
strong
coffee
chocolate
malt
smells
with
a
matching
taste
profile
there
are
enough
hops
in
there
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
keep
it
from
being
onesided
the
body
is
not
too
thick
as
you
may
think
the
carbonation
lifts
it
from
being
considered
cloying
nice
beer
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
spectacular
dark
color
with
a
head
color
that
tend
toward
brown
slight
chocolate
ans
prominent
sweet
notes
we
enjoyed
it
as
a
desert
beer
and
liked
it
so
much
we
stocked
up
at
the
local
bottle
store
a
seasonal
selection
so
dont
miss
the
opportunity
when
you
find
it
d
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
night
definitely
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
and
drink
again
d
very
difficult
to
put
down
a
large
bottle
in
one
sitting
the
alcohol
is
not
masked
very
effectively
as
it
is
in
some
other
examples
of
this
style
pours
a
very
dark
brown
getting
close
to
a
blackout
creamy
medium
brown
two
finger
head
forms
and
then
settles
to
a
quarter
inch
leaving
wisps
of
sticky

full

alcohol
starts
to
cut
through
mid
sip
but
still
really
nice

sticky
and
slightly

really
tasty
and
almost
flawless

edition
d
good

tasty
and
smooth
with
some
good

great
for
a
cold
winter
night
drinkability
goes
down
exceptionally
easy
very
little
alcohol
flavour
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
own
personal
taste
overall
a
very
solid
beer
d
excellent
this
is
going
down
fast
notwithstanding
the
high
alcohol
d
totally
drinkable
taste
is
spot
on
not
too
heavy
well
rounded
i
wouldnt
wanna
pound
this
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
at
a
cookout
but
fantastic
nonetheless

with
about
a
finger
of

head
that
settles
down
to
a
creamy
layer
of

that
sits
through
the
whole

i
kind
of
get
raspberries
and
dark

chocolate
toasty
dark
malty
flavors
with
a
slightly
bitter
coffee
flavor
to
round
it
out
the
feel
is
pretty
good
its
fully
and
creamy
with
soft
carbonation
drinks
nicely
also
one
of
the
best
of
the
styles
that
ive
had
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
reddish
mahagony
highlights
nice
tan
head
that
collars
around
the
rim
but
fades
rather
quicker
than
i
had
expected
nice
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
slight
roast
and
brown
sugar
i
really
am
hoping
this
thing
tastes
just
as
good
as
it
smells
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
very
smooth
drinking
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
for
me
the
dark
chocolate
notes
are
sweet
with
very
little
bitterness
some
dark
fruit
notes
as
well
blended
into
the
flavor
a
hint
of
smokinessroast
as
well
in
the
finish
overall
pretty
pleased
with
this
one
d
a
fantastic
beer
baltic
porters
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
beer
was
crafted
exceptionally
well
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
was
out
of
this
world
poured
from
bomber
into
dimpled
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
sized
foamy
tan
colored
head
that
leaves
nice
rings
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nice
and
shows
dark
chocolate
toasted
caramel
roasted
coffee
and
bittersweet
cocoa
some
earthy
hops
come
through
as
well
the
flavor
is
just
as
malt
forward
as
the
nose
lets
on
with
rich
chocolate
and
sweet
caramel
up
front
followed
by
roasted
coffee
and
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
medium
to
full
bodied
and
really
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
good
carbonation
with
a
lingering
roasty
finish
the
beer
pours
a
darkish
brown
color
with
very
good
head
retention
and
considerable
dark
mocha
colored
lacing
the
nose
is
likewise
attractive
consisting
of
coffee
grounds
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
while
the
flavor
profile
replicates
the
nose
there
just
more
of
everything
on
the
palate
the
intensity
of
flavor
is
very
impressiv
in
this
beer
and
the
moderate
sweetness
balanced
nicely
by
the
underlying
hops
seems
perfect
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
long
somewhat
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
there
is
some
nice
milk
chocolate
in
the
finish
as
well
that
i
really
like
drinkability
is
good
though
you
can
sense
the
alcohol
is
on
the
high
side
in
this
well
crafted
beer
still
this
is
a
delicious
well
made
baltic
porter
that
was
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
on
draft
d
this
is
actually
very
drinkable
for
as
dark
as
it
is
i
would
definitely
be
better
with
some
age
on
it
drinks
rather
well
with
some
booze
heat
throughout
but
not
harshness
very
flavorful
and
impressive
now
were
talking
for
6
range
smuttynose
has
delivered
a
tremendous
value
of
a
porter
poured
a
slow
to
emerge
2
head
which
took
quite
a
while
to
settle
down
to
a
trace
looks
dark
as
coffee
of
course
fantastic
smells
and
tastes
heavy
on
the
chocolate
side
and
light
on
the
coffee
side
not
as
rich
as
a
russian
imperial
stout
but
hanging
right
in
there
pours
engine
oil
black
with
full
head
of
brown
foam
that
settles
into
a
thin
layer
rich
roasted
smell
like
a
cup
of
coffee
chocolate
hints
thick
chewy
taste
roasted
but
fruity
tones
dark
fruit
smooth
and
creamy
light
residual
bitter
taste
very
balanced
plummy
full
of
flavor
good
drinker
d
high
for
a
high
abv
loving
this
one
can
see
myself
buying
4
or
6
packs
of
this
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
of
baltic
porters
in
general
but
if
baltic
porters
are
your
thing
this
is
certainly
something
you
might
like
cheers
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
but
still
drinkable
and
doesnt
get
too
assertive
until
it
warms
up
to
room
temp
enjoy
drinkabityquite
drinkable
a
bomber
goes
pretty
quickly
d
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
even
if
the
taste
didnt
wow
me
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
with
no
elements
getting
out
of
control
as
it
seems
like
sweetness
easily
could
have
this
is
one
hell
of
a
porter
a
definite
winner
from
smuttynose
a
must
have
for
every
porter
lover
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
very
full
and
silky
smooth
this
was
exactly
the
beer
i
was
hoping
for
this
morning
a
very
easy
to
drink
treat
from
start
to
finish
d
well
overall
i
would
say
its
the
best
porter
i
ever
had
and
very
affordable
for
6
dollars
a
bottle
in
a
way
my
review
is
kind
of
construed
due
to
the
fact
i
had
an
old
rasputin
before
sampling
d
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
which
is
a
nice
winter
sipper
but
it
could
use
a
more
powerful
presence
of
roast
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
still
solid
all
the
way
around
like
smuttynose
offerings
always
are
medium
to
full
feel
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
this
brew
is
quite
drinkable
it
coats
the
inside
of
the
mouth
with
a
burnt
layering
of
grains
as
fitting
as
the
label
states
this
is
a
bold
brew
with
the
abv
right
out
in
the
open
22
ounce
bottle
from
november
2010
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
caramel
and
dark
fruit
i
think
the
brew
tastes
just
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
coffee
flavors
being
the
strongest
mouthfeelbody
is
full
its
creamy
and
rich
with
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
amazing
its
very
smooth
and
goes
down
quite
easy
the
9
abv
isnt
noticable
at
all
in
the
aroma
or
taste
which
also
helps
make
this
beer
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
fine
baltic
porter
and
a
great
overall
brew
too
definitely
recommended
and
a
great
deal
at
5
99
a
bottle
if
you
like
big
dark
chocolatey
stouts
with
noted
of
coffee
you
will
like
this
baltic
porter
from
smuttynose
very
nice
d
practically
perfect
a
great
balance
of
flavor
and
big
beerness
to
make
this
a
fireside
sipper
or
a
more
regular
drink
drinkability
yep
without
question
this
ones
smooth
and
dangerously
drinkable
at
9
02010
version
one
on
top
of
the
other
in
one
sitting
is
not
a
problem
by
far
my
favorite
offering
from
smuttynose
well
done
guys
drinkability
is
great
wonderful
favorable
hell
even
affordable
what
more
could
you
want
dont
know
if
i
was
just
in
the
mood
for
this
but
finding
it
excellent
d
very
tasty
and
will
have
a
second
but
the
style
leads
to
not
having
too
many
nothing
short
of
outstanding
its
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
im
downing
the
22oz
bomber
all
by
my
little
ol
self
with
no
trouble
what
so
ever
i
dont
have
another
but
two
would
probably
be
too
much
for
me
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
end
of
the
evening
on
a
cold
winters
night
with
my
pipe
clenched
between
my
teeth
d
this
a
little
heavy
on
the
dark
fruit
taste
for
me
but
an
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
i
will
be
sure
to
grab
this
next
year
as
well
overall
impression
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
excellent
brew
22
oz
bottle
pours
black
with
a
thick
brown
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
malt
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
full
body
some
tartness
the
flavor
is
chocolate
coffee
dark
fruit
fruity
sweetness
nicely
balanced
with
coffee
bitterness
finish
is
enormous
long
lasting
and
very
balanced
simply
great
draft
at
chruchkey
possibly
my
favorite
beer
of
winter
so
far
and
its
not
even
winter
and
that
includes
bitches
brew
d
how
did
beer
escape
my
attention
all
these
years
this
my
be
my
new
favorite
smutty
brew
even
better
than
the
ipa
which
is
a
bit
overrated
imo
the
year
of
aging
has
mellowed
out
any
booziness
from
the
8
7
abv
that
the
2009
version
was
great
complex
brew
that
only
got
better
as
it
warmed
overall
smutty
did
a
nice
job
with
this
years
batch
and
i
highly
recommend
this
to
porter
lovers
and
dark
beer
enthusiasts
perhaps
im
finally
sunsetting
my
ipa
jonze
until
springtime
after
a
bit
of
trepidation
at
the
start
for
the
overpowering
bitterness
the
beer
settled
down
and
finished
out
nicely
balanced
though
the
bitterness
is
always
evident
the
8
7
abv
is
well
hidden
until
inebriation
sets
in
smuttynose
if
you
see
this
please
consider
making
bp
one
of
your
regulars
this
is
smokey
and
digestive
but
rich
like
a
dessert
i
would
still
recommend
food
with
this
something
hardy
to
back
it
particular
pork
as
meat
or
goulash
goat
may
work
well
too
even
something
pickled
to
change
the
palate
up
a
bit
but
a
dense
beer
made
for
dense
food
d
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
im
glad
i
finally
picked
one
up
on
a
trip
d
i
didnt
have
trouble
putting
down
a
bomber
of
this
but
i
think
it
would
be
best
served
in
a
12oz
bottle
drinkability
pretty
solid
its
a
solid
beer
and
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
it
generally
represents
the
style
it
should
be
a
little
bit
lighter
less
roasty
and
less
hoppy
its
quite
tasty
though
and
really
nicely
malty
worth
trying
bottled
in
2009
poured
into
a
great
divide
glass
jet
black
with
a
thick
foamy
three
finger
tan
head
good
lacing
and
retention
i
cant
get
much
of
a
scent
because
its
allergy
season
the
taste
has
notes
of
dark
chocolate
carmel
and
smoke
its
rather
odd
because
the
taste
is
very
powerful
yet
the
mouthfeel
is
slighty
thin
nothing
that
takes
anything
away
from
this
porter
the
alochol
does
leave
a
slight
burn
in
the
aftertaste
d
this
isnt
very
boozy
and
i
could
go
for
another
thick
and
rich
this
is
a
great
sipper
im
going
to
revisit
this
one
on
a
cold
winter
night
md
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
crisp
finish
very
easy
drinking
with
a
well
masked
almost
9
abv
notes
i
have
to
say
that
i
love
this
beer
i
love
big
complex
dark
beers
and
this
one
delivers
d
the
strength
of
the
flavor
and
feel
might
limit
how
many
you
could
have
but
you
certainly
want
many
this
is
an
excellent
beer
great
flavor
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
it
is
filling
dlove
smuttynose
lets
party
highly
recommended
d
a
sipper
for
sure
open
this
one
when
you
have
the
time
to
enjoy
it
i
had
no
problem
killing
the
bomber
robust
roasty
and
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
dark
fruit
has
a
grassy
bitterness
that
dries
things
out
fairly
well
but
still
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
mouthfeel
is
decidedly
full
with
a
welcoming
creamy
aspect
not
smooth
per
say
this
one
still
has
some
rough
edges
but
in
this
beer
it
seems
to
work
in
its
favor
vanilla
rich
molasses
and
even
a
hint
of
smoke
comes
out
as
it
warms
excellent
satisfying
beer
that
the
last
quarter
of
the
bottle
paired
ridiculously
well
with
cheesecake
overall
this
was
crisp
sharp
and
smooth
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
warm
alcohol
presence
which
increased
as
you
progressed
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
especially
for
the
price
worth
the
purchase
10
times
out
of
10
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
d
great
great
beer
was
really
excited
to
see
it
out
of
season
and
grabbed
it
without
hesitation
ill
probably
stock
up
this
coming
winter
as
it
seemed
to
take
the
age
pretty
well
d
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
but
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
given
its
strength
feels
wonderful
in
the
mouth
full
up
front
lighter
at
the
finnish
but
with
flavor
that
coats
and
lasts
a
heavy
but
drinkable
beer
another
nice
extra
from
an
east
coast
trade
this
one
has
been
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
refrigerator
for
a
while
now
so
i
figured
i
should
pull
it
out
tonight
pours
a
nice
rich
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
good
two
inches
of
medium
brown
foam
aromas
of
molasses
dark
fruits
and
dark
chocolate
nice
flavors
of
roasted
malt
port
wine
and
stewed
fruits
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
decently
drinkable
for
the
style
but
not
an
easy
style
to
drink
would
pick
up
again
if
in
the
mood
for
this
style
yeah
the
subtle
underpinnings
of
a
sweet
tasty
beer
packed
into
a
darker
more
robust
hamper
very
drinkable
for
its
breadth
and
depth
to
be
completely
fair
ive
had
better
and
richer
dark
strong
beers
this
is
a
very
nice
one
but
i
must
have
had
unreasonably
high
expectations
the
ashiness
brings
down
the
drinkability
but
it
seems
about
right
for
8
5
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
drinks
well
for
what
it
is
overall
a
very
decent
example
of
the
style
mf
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
imo
but
still
smooth
and
light
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
coming
in
just
a
tad
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
this
is
just
a
damn
fine
bp
one
of
the
best
ive
come
across
beer
is
medium
body
finishes
nicely
mostly
sweet
and
a
mild
bitterness
and
roastiness
at
the
back
end
drinkability
good
and
mouthfeel
is
good
excellent
beer
lots
to
explore
with
a
dome
of
simple
good
taste
very
nice
overall
one
of
my
personal
favorites
and
regular
drinkers
fantastic
job
once
again
by
smuttynose
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
not
a
good
rendition
of
a
baltic
porter
you
can
have
both
better
beers
and
better
baltic
porters
i
dont
agree
with
the
preponderance
of
ecstatic
reviews
this
is
very
full
flavored
and
doesnt
blow
the
taste
buds
out
the
alcohol
will
limit
consumption
but
a
bomber
is
a
pleasure
d
a
nice
sipper
probably
my
favorite
smuttynose
beer
to
date
d
not
easy
but
not
hard
bolder
beer
for
a
porter
but
decent
drinkability
for
this
style
of
beer
nice
to
try
once
might
drink
again
if
was
offered
to
me
and
other
styles
were
given
that
are
not
appealing
d
a
huge
roasty
experience
definitely
worthy
by
all
regards
by
style
making
for
a
great
sipper
that
finishes
every
bit
as
good
as
it
started
solid
and
worthy
of
repurchase
and
praise
d
only
the
high
abv
would
limit
consumption
probably
great
with
anything
from
dark
dessert
to
roasted
meats
drinkability
this
is
incredibly
tasty
just
like
their
robust
porter
but
bigger
almost
too
easy
to
drink
the
higher
abv
keeps
this
from
going
down
too
fast
although
the
flavor
is
so
tempting
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
halfway
through
the
bottle
but
only
acts
as
a
compliment
to
flavor
another
fantastic
beer
from
smuttynose
this
big
beer
makes
for
a
substantive
quaff
on
any
cold
new
hampshire
night
overallthe
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
and
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
depth
and
complexity
to
it
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
dreally
great
tasting
the
best
baltic
porter
i
have
had
yet
dalcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
the
balanced
taste
makes
this
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
interpretations
of
the
style
a
more
crisp
baltic
porter
than
i
was
expecting
and
wellcarbonated
which
gives
this
beer
somewhat
of
a
thinner
overall
mouthfeel
still
sticky
notes
of
bakers
chocolate
coat
the
palate
with
lots
of
dark
roasty
flavor
earthy
hops
chime
in
for
the
finish
with
a
mediumbodied
consistency
definitely
a
beer
i
hope
to
encounter
again
sometime
nice
job
smuttynose
nice
and
drinkable
considering
the
apv
i
think
i
may
actually
prefer
this
to
the
smutty

the

review
right
on
the
taste

suit
with
the
brown
sugar
now
joined
by
molasses
and
the
pine
standing
out
at
first
with
glimpses
into
the

toffee
and
debutante
figs
coming
into
focus
shortly
thereafter
as
totos

begins
i
notice
the
body
nearing
heavy
it
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
its
just
the
right
amount
to
guide
me
toward
salvation
though
somewhat
chewy
the
incredibly
smooth
finish
spiting
the
carbonation
in
a
grand
stroke
of
defiance
makes
this
brew
one
that
will
take
a
lot
to
drag
me
away
from
ah
the
80s
one
pint
at
a
time
but
what
a
time
it
is
savor
each
sip
and
cozy
up
with
someone
you
love
and
enjoy
the
day
the
next
chance
i
get
ill
try
this
in
a
snifter
glass
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
i
am
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
but
i
would
like
to
cellar
a
few
of
these
the
best
american
interpretation
of
a
baltic
porter
that
i
have
had
damn
near
black
in
color
with
a
large
brown
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
rich
complex
aroma
that
features
the
dark
malt
hints
of
chocolate
licorice
and
raisins
a
little
bit
of
alchol
lofts
off
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
flavor
is
also
rich
and
malty
surprising
amount
of
dark
fruit
comes
through
that
compliments
the
bitter
chocolate
and
licorice
just
the
faintest
sign
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
cloying
as
well
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
that
features
the
best
carbonation
for
such
a
large
beer
soft
and
delicate
carbonation
compliments
the
rest
of
the
beer
perfectly
i
doubt
any
beer
in
the
ba
top
100
has
a
better
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
thanks
to
the
pleasant
flavor
and
fantastic
mouthfeel
the
only
hinderance
is
the
abv
whoa
serious
beer
served
with
a
nice
sized
light
tan
fine
foamy
head
and
good
lace
aroma
is
malty
sweet
dark
ripe
fruit
a
bit
roasty
and
good
ditto
flavor
and
all
of
that
comes
out
much
more
boldly
body
is
great
and
carbonation
too
finish
is
mainly
sweet
with
some
bitterness
to
temper
a
bit
too
big
to
be
a
session
but
nevertheless
a
major
world
class
brew
d
very
drinkable
a
great
dessert
drink
as
well
as
a
session
beer
for
me
a
little
high
on
the
abvs
so
id
watch
it
of
course
but
otherwise
this
is
very
drinkable
for
me
another
great
beer
from
smuttynose
its
hard
to
put
a
label
on
porter
with
so
many
styles
out
there
this
one
is
close
to
stout
like
in
its
richness
very
good
thanks
to
thechrislife
for
this
fella
fullbodied
creamy
smooth
with
a
very
slightly
dry
finish
slightly
warming
good
stuff
maynard
d
pretty
drinkable
even
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
all
the
flavors
are
there
and
they
blend
well
together
really
nice
beer
another
great
offering
from
smuttynose
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
imperial
stout
in
the
cellar
d
look
forward
to
every
sip
delicious
another
winner
for
the
best
northeast
brewer
overall
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
lots
of
flavor
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
think
12
oz
bottles
would
be
a
much
better
size
unless
splitting
with
a
friend
luckily
i
had
a
friend
to
enjoy
it
with
me
i
recommend
this
one
d
im
not
sure
id
need
a
whole
22oz
of
this
but
a
glass
was
quite
pleasant
this
is
a
good
nofrills
baltic
porter
that
can
serve
as
a
baseline
for
those
interested
in
investigating
the
style
especially
with
its
eminently
reasonable
price
of
56
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
the
label
states
bottle
conditioned
in
2008
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
smuttynose
shaker
glass
the
porter
appears
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
tan
foam
the
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
raisins
prunes
molasses
dark
cherries
bittersweet
and
milk
chocolates
plums
and
caramel
just
about
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
very
little
alcohol
heat
to
speak
of
if
you
happen
to
have
a
2008
by
all
means
enjoy
it
now
d
wow
i
am
definitely
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
usually
like
to
split
bombers
of
big
porters
and
imperial
stouts
with
comrades
like
the
bottle
suggests
but
i
just
made
this
one
last
an
entire
friday
afternoon
thanks
for
another
amazing
beer
jason
alcohol
is
quite
wellhidden
on
the
palate
though
after
a
while
it
begins
to
show
itself
in
earnest
in
the
head
this
is
likely
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
imperial
type
beers
ive
enjoyed
as
of
late
with
a
spectacular
balance
of
character
combined
with
a
rich
decadence
that
perfectly
suits
it
as
a
nightcap
or
dessert
beer
and
at
under
six
dollars
for
a
22
oz
bottle
it
is
quite
the
bargain
spectacular
d
a
solidly
drinkable
baltic
porter
as
i
said
not
exactly
in
keeping
with
the
style
but
very
well
made
very
creamy
body
carbonation
level
is
low
this
is
just
silky
smooth
this
is
a
very
sweet
baltic
mild
coffee
bitterness
present
but
this
has
notes
of
vanilla
chocolate
milk
and
a
little
grape
on
the
finish
this
isnt
as
bold
as
i
expected
but
it
is
still
good
nonetheless
drinkability
pretty
damned
tasty
brewski
its
fairly
easy
drinking
and
its
just
chocked
full
of
chocolaty
goodness
it
can
get
ever
so
slightly
cloying
towards
the
bottle
of
the
bottle
but
nothing
to
crazy
thanks
much

smuttynose
baltic
porter
is
a
dense
brownish
black
beer
with
a
tall
dense
brown
head
with
oily
bubbles
it
leaves
very
nice
even
lacing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
licorice
wood
resin
molasses
dark
roastiness
and
chocolate
its
pretty
full
bodied
smooth
fluffy
chewy
a
little
bubbly
and
the
finish
is
slightly
acidic
it
actually
tastes
pretty
dry
and
its
really
well
balanced
with
some
bitterness
there
are
flavors
of
licorice
wood
resin
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
the
slight
sweetness
comes
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
resiny
bitterness
and
alcohol
its
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
you
could
pass
this
off
as
an
imperial
stout
i
got
this
22
for
four
and
a
quarter
d
ive
had
a
few
different
baltic
porters
and
this
one
is
easily
the
best
great

with

of

as
well
as

metallic
hint
barely
detectable
towards

still
mighty
tasty
i
have
to
say
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
lively
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
towards
the
finish
this
is
a
really
delicious
beer
i
have
to
say
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
night
and
a
bargain
to
boot
at

i
love
this
brewery
i
could
probably
kill
two
more
of
these
bombers
and
be
good
this
drove
me
to
put
on
my
weakling
dead
as
dreams
record
and
rock
out
any
beer
that
brings
out
the
black
metal
spirit
is
probably
good
one
baltic
indeed
d
it
is
truly
on
of
the
worlds
best
baltic
porters
in
my
opinion
d
a
highly
drinkable
baltic
porter
very
smooth
and
clean
with
mild
alcohol
effect
on
the
palate
highly
recommended
smuttynose
makes
solid
beers
though
it
is
is
not
a
great
beer
it
is
a
solid
one
that
i
will
seek
out
again
very
enjoyable
beer
worth
looking
for
it
put
it
on
the
top
of
your
beer
search
list
d
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
not
even
a
blink
when
asked
to
drink
next
review
bottomline
this
is
a
big
badass
beer
that
gets
up
every
morning
and
eats
jagermeister
covered
pancakes
while
listening
to
slayer
overall
a
wonderful
beer
and
imo
a
great
buy
at
7
per
bomber
wish
it
was
more
available
in
california
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
absolutely
tasty
and
full
of
character
the
flavor
is
rich
the
brew
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
8
7
abv
is
buried
drinkability
on
this
is
on
par
for
what
one
would
expect
for
a
8
7
baltic
porter
cannot
drink
it
all
night
but
would
love
to
be
able
to
the
taste
seems
more
like
a
classic
ris
than
a
baltic
porter
i
often
find
this
style
to
have
an
odd
sweetness
that
turns
me
away
but
this
one
is
damn
nice
good
chocolate
cake
background
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
dark
malts
and
hops
the
body
is
nearly
full
and
there
is
tons
of
carbonationperhaps
a
tad
too
much
but
the
body
makes
up
for
it
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
really
didnt
have
any
expectations
and
came
out
of
this
wanting
more
the
smell
is
really
roasty
some
nice
bitter
chocolate
and
a
roasted
saltiness
really
stand
out
well
these
same
characteristics
carry
into
the
flavor
matched
with
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavors
go
far
once
again
smuttynose
fails
to
disappoint
in
their
big
beer
series
im
really
falling
for
this
brewery
looks
like
a
struck
match
when
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
thick
creamy
brown
froth
great
retention
above
average
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
sweet
with
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
coffee
alcohol
molasses
smoke
baking
spices
dark
fruit
chocolate
cake
follow
through
on
the
palate
with
a
pronounced
roasted
malt
smokiness
the
beer
is
dry
but
sweet
with
a
syrupy
texture
creamy
mouthfeel
long
finish
and
a
smooth
hop
bitterness
from
beginning
to
end
due
to
its
hop
presence
and
roasted
flavor
i
could
easily
confuse
this
for
a
ris
in
a
blind
tasting
from
the
baltic
porters
that
ive
had
in
the
past
i
would
be
looking
for
less
of
a
hop
presence
less
of
a
roasted
flavor
more
of
a
dark
fruit
characteristic
found
in
traditional
styles
still
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
and
oily
with
a
good
tight
bite
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
i
jumped
back
and
forth
between
4
4
5
and
5
0
on
every
single
category
on
this
beer
and
i
mention
this
to
suggest
that
there
are
a
lot
of
intangibles
about
this
beer
it
changes
a
lot
as
it
warms
and
i
believe
the
whole
here
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
quintessential
baltic
porter
this
one
hits
all
the
right
notes
with
few
missteps
and
comes
highly
recommended
at
a
very
reasonable
and
drinkable
stylistically
speaking
8
7
abv
excellent
drinkability
goes
down
very
easily
excellent
and
would
love
to
have
again
the
only
thing
making
me
hesitate
to
call
this
an
imperial
porter
is
that
even
now
that
the
beer
has
reached
room
temperature
it
hides
its
alcohol
masterfully
as
much
as
it
trumpets
its
big
flavour
it
has
managed
to
ditch
the
alcohol
or
any
perception
of
it
anyhow
ive
come
to
expect
nothing
less
from
a
brewer
who
has
proven
a
master
of
both
versatility
and
consistency
another
stellar
offering
from
one
of
americas
most
stellar
breweries
this
is
a
huge
baltic
porter
with
tons
of
robust
flavor
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
a
bit
of
a
sipper
at
the
same
time
superb
d
not
what
i
would
call
sessionable
but
an
excellent
brew
d
probably
one
of
if
not
the
best
baltic
porters
i
have
ever
had
this
is
ridiculously
drinkable
i
would
strongly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
enjoy
porters
or
any
dark
beers
22oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
black
with
caramalbrown
two
fingers
foam
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
this
taste
is
much
thicker
then
their
imperial
stout
so
a
much
heavier
body
definately
the
best
porter
i
have
had
but
i
much
prefer
they
imperial
stout
by
smuttynose
quite
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
im
already
buzzing
off
just
this
bomber
good
beer
overall
though
there
are
a
few
relatively
insignificant
imperfections
this
is
an
awesome
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
its
highly
drinkable
drinkability
as
i
said
before
this
is
a
really
good
beer
to
sip
or
even
put
down
a
few
with
a
smoke
dquite
drinkable
with
the
smoothness
taken
back
slightly
by
the
hopscarbonation
combo
of
the
baltic
porters
i
have
had
this
is
certianly
the
most
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
slightly
detectable
but
does
not
dominate
or
fatigue
the
palate
most
baltics
seem
to
be
really
sweet
and
overly
alcoholic
this
one
is
not
a
really
nice
representation
d
awfully
rich
but
still
very
drinkable
because
of
the
delicious
taste
and
fluffy
texture
i
would
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
d
moderate
the
bomber
went
down
with
no
problem
another
tasty
treat
from
smuttynose
which
is
quickly
surpassing
dfh
as
my
favorite
east
coast
brewery
seriously
as
a
nh
native
at
heart
i
am
thrilled
to
be
within
the
distro
of
smuttynose
truly
a
spectacular
beer
and
another
notch
on
the
wellworn
belt
of
smuttynose
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
pretty
decent
baltic
porter
but
it
in
no
way
wowed
me
as
it
has
others
worth
a
try
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
a
porter
and
this
is
one
that
will
have
me
wanting
to
try
many
more
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
amazingly
well
by
the
flavors
the
feel
is
of
this
beer
is
medium
and
is
not
too
big
for
a
big
beer
a
great
beer
for
the
cool
fall
night
and
those
even
colder
winter
hibernating
months
this
is
a
full
rich
big
beer
feel
is
massive
drinkability
is
very
good
limited
more
by
the
strong
bold
flavor
which
you
want
to
slow
down
and
savor
rather
than
any
perceived
alcohol
presence
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
look
to
grab
another
couple
of
bottles
when
the
time
comes
drinkability
is
moderate
the
rich
roasted
flavors
and
aroma
are
really
greatly
representative
of
the
style
the
heavy
alcohol
and
stickiness
is
all
that
slows
me
down
outro
can
you
tell
by
ra
ra
riot
the
taste
is
very
creamy
very
smooth
and
dangerously
drinkable
at
8
7
abv
there
is
a
very
nice
cocoa
powder
flavor
to
the
beer
lots
of
roasted
sweet
malts
chocolatey
flavors
some
slight
cherry
dark
chocolate
there
is
a
warming
thick
and
chewy
syrupy
consistency
to
this
full
bodied
beer
it
is
quite
substantial
full
palated
there
are
plenty
of
roasted
notes
but
the
beer
is
very
sweet
there
is
an
oily
mouthfeel
going
on
just
a
touch
of
the
throatiness
due
to
the
high
abv
and
lots
are
charred
creaminess
in
the
finish
this
is
very
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
really
nice
brew
that
is
packed
full
of
roasted
bitterness
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
decent
dark
tan
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
brown
malts
and
cocoa
but
does
not
do
the
taste
justice
at
all
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
bitter
cocoa
brown
malts
molasses
and
dried
fruits
very
enjoyable
and
complex
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
but
the
alcohol
is
not
intrusive
at
all
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
this
is
a
truly
spectacular
baltic
porter
all
in
all
another
solid
offering
from
smuttys
big
beer
series
d
a
great
beer
for
the
style
and
an
overall
great
beer
i
couldnt
believe
it
when
i
found
this
at
my
local
beer
shop
wow
what
a
tremendous
brew
probably
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
a
real
treat
overall
before
this
i
had
never
had
a
baltic
porter
needless
to
say
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
example
of
the
style
and
would
love
to
try
others
poured
a
deep
deep
brown
sluggish
with
good
carbonation
brown
head
nose
is
big
roasted

choco

taste
is
cocoa
roasted
notes
raisins
figs
alcohol
and
oh
so
good
mouthfeel
is
creamy
well
balanced
with
a
big
taste
drinkability
is
well
probably
one
of
the
best
impbaltic
porters
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
that
covers
up
the
8
7
percent
abv
well
i
wish
i
had
ready
access
to
it
food
pairing
grilled
or
smoked
beef
chocolate
and
or
coffee
flavored
rich
desserts
lightly
smokey
nutty
and
rich
cheeses
make
mine
a
smutty
md
a
bit
silky
but
otherwise
thin
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
would
recommend
simple
one
finger
head
of
mainly
tiny
foam
very
dark
brown
in
color
leaves
a
credible
amount
of
lacing
however
the
head
does
not
seem
that
interested
in
sticking
around
little
to
say
about
the
color
except
that
it
is
pitch
black
with
no
evidence
of
any
other
hue
the
nose
possesses
great
penetrating
power
without
any
sign
of
showing
off
carob
coffee
bean
dark
chocolate
and
butterscotch
meld
into
black
raisin
date
plum
fruit
thick
streak
of
black
licorice
doesnt
show
much
esters
if
you
can
hold
off
from
indulging
in
it
you
can
find
some
orange
citrus
and
pressed
flowers
hops
were
indeed
used
in
making
this
beer
fullbodied
sturdy
and
broadshouldered
has
a
dense
muscularity
rather
than
just
be
big
per
se
the
carbonation
is
made
up
of
larger
slow
bursting
bubbles
which
fit
the
feel
no
fine
fizz
or
extra
effervescence
toasted
malt
roasted
coffee
butterscotch
and
cocoa
adroitly
maneuvers
between
sweetness
and
dryness
raisin
date
fig
plum
cherry
and
even
some
apricot
fruit
there
for
the
taking
again
licorice
and
flowers
seem
to
be
next
in
line
just
the
right
amount
of
bitters
and
grains
on
the
finish
to
reset
the
palate
for
the
next
sip
this
is
close
to
benchmark
shit
drinkability
is
great
nicely
balanced
great
depth
good
stuff
i
owe
david
a
big
one
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
with
mild
carbonation
and
highly
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
one
more
good
reason
to
make
mine
a
smutty
anytime
d
a
delicious
porter
id
definitely
have
another
and
pass
along
the
good
word
to
a
friend
this
is
a
deep
bold
and
complex
brew
a
real
sipper
that
took
me
a
while
to
work
my
way
through
alcohol
warmth
is
quite
obvious
on
the
finish
but
the
alcohol
itself
is
exceptionally
well
hidden
within
the
beers
huge
flavors
darker
denser
and
decidedly
less
sweet
than
last
nights
long
trail
imperial
porter
which
i
also
enjoyed
greatly
this
is
a
real
treat
d
not
the
most
drinkable
porter
out
there
i
think
this
could
improve
with
some
short
term
aging
perhaps
9
months
to
a
year
the
flavors
are
just
not
integrated
very
well
at
this
young
stage
the
abv
while
high
is
not
so
high
that
it
scares
me
id
say
its
at
the
perfect
size
it
took
some
time
to
get
through
my
glass
good
stuff
nothing
mindblowing
yet
drinkability
was
awesome
i
easily
drank
a
couple
glasses
looking
at
the
two
years
side
by
side
i
will
say
i
liked
this
years
a
little
more
than
last
good
drinkability
good
beer
overall
im
not
sure
why
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
try
this
one
but
im
glad
that
i
did
for
baltic
lovers
or
the
uninitiated
this
brew
belongs
in
your
portfolio
d
no
way
i
could
drink
more
than
2
of
these
but
very
tasty
concoction
here
i
really
enjoy
the
smokey
booze
here
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
more
i
fall
in
love
the
only
knock
i
have
is
that
its
roughly
twice
the
price
of
some
of
the
beers
that
it
emulates
so
well
still
6
a
bomber
is
money
well
spent
the
flavor
is
chocolate
with
a
little
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
somewhat
bland
the
sweetness
wears
on
me
as
i
progress
through
the
glass
the
finish
is
sugary
sweet
chocolate
the
beer
is
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
really
watery
mouthfeel
blah
ive
had
10
or
so
beers
from
this
brewery
and
havent
liked
any
of
them
thanks
to
atsprings
for
sharing
a
bomber
full
flavored
balanced
and
with
a
mouthfeel
that
just
absolutely
nails
the
style
what
little
alcohol
there
is
will
probably
get
more
integrated
with
time
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
from
a
fantastic
brewery
drinkability
the
bottle
was
rather
large
and
the
drink
very
filling
so
i
could
only
take
one
for
what
it
was
worth
that
one
was
very
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
porter
with
a
large
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
aromatic
coffee
with
notes
of
creamy
black
chocolate
taste
is
very
well
balance
between
aromatic
coffee
without
any
dryness
with
some
great
creamy
black
chocolate
notes
with
some
subtle
dry
raisins
in
the
finish
body
is
quite
full
with
a
creamy
texture
and
no
apparent
alcohol
another
very
nice
beer
from
a
great
brewer
big
flavorlots
of
chocolate
and
black
patent
malt
subtle
comparatively
hop
finish
although
the
aftertaste
is
great
blend
of
all
of
the
flavors
already
mentioned
full
bodied
with
distinct
alcohol
warmth
without
being
oily
typical
excellent
smuttynose
overall
a
top
notch
brew
from
smuttynose
i
prefer
this
leaps
and
bounds
over
there
fruity
imperial
stout
i
was
happy
to
finally
see
this
in
my
local
bottleshop
ive
seen
many
other
smuttys
there
over
the
years
but
finally
got
this
one
very
much
worth
the
wait
i
wish
i
had
another
one
or
two
to
hold
on
to
for
a
year
to
see
how
it
ages
highly
recommended
cheers
d
gone
before
i
knew
it
almost
didnt
leave
enough
to
review
it
with
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
this
abv
beer
the
alcohol
isnt
very
apparent
but
this
is
a
big
beer
and
very
complex
so
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
a
very
good
sipper
22
oz
very
nice
looking
dark
pour
nearly
black
with
some
brown
head
chocolate
molasses
peat
and
roast
malt
aroma
flavor
matches
these
well
plenty
of
dark
chocolate
roast
malt
and
some
coffee
more
coffee
and
licorice
in
the
finish
thick
full
body
good
carbonation
gets
a
little
more
bitey
when
it
warms
for
a
while
only
because
it
was
still
near
80
out
and
i
drank
the
whole
bomber
drinkability
is
excellent
abv
not
noticeable
at
all
one
of
the
better
baltics
ive
had
for
sure
drinkability
great
beer
heavy
as
all
hell
but
in
a
good
way
situational
sipper
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
like
a
delicious
meal
that
you
finish
wish
you
would
want
more
but
its
satisfied
you
enough
that
you
dont
great
beer
aroma
is
strong
malty
slightly
smoky
and
chocolaty
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
quite
appetizing
it
pours
an
opaque
dark
chocolate
brown
just
about
sable
with
a
very
thick
if
not
too
persistent
tan
head
flavor
is
chocolaty
and
a
little
sweet
with
an
undertone
of
roast
coffee
texture
is
thick
oily
and
strongly
tingly
so
it
practically
dances
down
the
pipes
recommended
enjoyed
ontap
at
coles
aroma
of
chocolate
and
roast
black
but
reflecting
light
brown
soapy
head
some
alce
full
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
right
there
fierce
chocolate
is
right
in
front
the
finish
is
coffee
with
some
sourness
running
through
midsip
overall
this
is
a
solid
effort
and
is
my
favoriate
big
beer
of
smuttynoses
to
date
worth
a
shot
drinkability
a
year
of
aging
has
turned
this
beer
into
a
superb
drinker
gone
is
the
warmth
and
bitter
hop
flavors
not
that
those
are
all
bad
but
what
remains
is
a
blend
of
chocolate
and
fruit
that
knocks
the
style
profile
out
of
the
park
note
this
was
a
2009
bottle
im
betting
it
would
be
wonderful
and
improve
substantially
with
some
age
as
the
heat
mellows
give
it
12
years
and
i
would
imagine
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
to
each
creep
up
at
least
12
a
point
if
not
more
very
tasty
and
drinkable
will
need
to
stock
up
on
a
few
of
these
before
theyre
gone
drinkability
pretty
solid
its
a
solid
beer
and
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
it
generally
represents
the
style
it
should
be
a
little
bit
lighter
less
roasty
and
less
hoppy
its
quite
tasty
though
and
really
nicely
malty
worth
trying
d
nice
representation
of
style
would
most
likely
only
drink
one
at
a
time
as
this
feels
very
strong
and
more
than
one
would
be
a
lot
d
smuttynose
baltic
porter
certainly
did
not
disappoint
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
highly
recommended

black

not

one

definitely
invites
another
with
the

the
best

exuberantly

as
compared
to

but
with
some
of
the
same
roastiness
and
dark
chocolate
notes
smooth
and
long
in
the
mouth
very
nice
finishing
off
a
bottle
that
i
gave
to
my
dad
from
yesterday
and
this
beer
was
still
great
it
has
a
nice
brown
lacing
and
good
carbonation
considering
the
bottle
had
been
open
for
a
day
its
a
viscous
black
with
lots
of
roast
and
chocolate
hitting
the
nose
the
chocolate
is
both
sweet
and
bitter
very
well
balanced
with
a
creamy
full
body
the
bitterness
lingers
longer
than
the
sweetness
but
is
very
pleasant
my
favorite
beer
by
the
folks
at
smuttynose
overall
a
genuine
sipper
but
one
you
are
eager
to
get
through
quickly
the
alcohol
is
a
factor
that
keeps
this
one
from
being
too
quaffable
but
that
is
not
the
purpose
here
not
one
that
youd
swill
around
the
barbeque
but
rather
the
one
you
crack
and
savor
at
night
when
the
rest
of
the
house
turned
in
for
the
evening
from
the
smutty
perspective
i
take
this
brew
hands
down
over
their
imperial
stout
grab
one
when
available
if
you
like
big
robust
strong
beers
enjoy
d
very
nice
and
pretty
much
all
that
i
expect
aroma
and
flavor
sure
as
hell
was
on
point
and
did
not
disappoint
with
that
said
this
is
a
sipper
and
is
to
be
taken
slow
and
savored
this
makes
this
brew
a
very
nice
cooler
weather
brew
that
warms
and
satisfies
flavor
and
aroma
lived
up
to
expectations
but
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
heavy
this
lowered
my
scores
on
feel
and
drinkability
still
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
and
will
always
be
open
to
pick
up
a
bottle
another
great
porter
and
another
great
beer
by
smuttynose
a
very
fine
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
elements
going
on
in
this
beer
definitely
a
sipper
this
is
an
excellent
regional
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
will
only
improve
with
some
age
this
beer
has
many
of
the
characteristics
of
a
robust
porter
or
stout
but
not
the
flavor
or
aroma
to
match
pours
like
an
imp
stout
super
dark
and
viscous
with
a
dark
brown
head
not
too
much
aroma
to
pick
out
really
just
a
slight
toasted
presence
which
is
barely
detectable
from
the
glass
flavor
also
is
quite
lacking
just
sort
of
your
typical
roasty
stout
character
but
very
very
subdued
the
mouth
and
body
of
the
beer
are
that
of
a
chewy
imperial
stout
super
robust
and
viscous
but
this
also
highlights
how
lacking
the
flavor
is
drinkability
is
questionable
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
as
i
said
it
is
quite
thick
and
without
even
the
richness
of
flavor
to
back
it
up
not
bad
but
disappointing
fresh
pours

very
deep

some

no

smooth
as
all
hell
amazing
for
the
style
i
will
be
purchasing
at
least
6
of
these
drinkability
is
good
since
its
very
delicious
and
complex
at
the
same
time
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
so
far
cheers
smuttynose
d
too
big
and
palate
killing
would
still
try
lol
thanks
again
todd
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
full
bodied
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
maybe
a
touch
higher
than
it
should
be
but
that
is
because
i
am
basing
the
drinkability
on
my
desire
to
drink
it
again
as
frequently
as
i
can
i
would
gladly
drink
several
bombers
of
this
a
night
but
i
am
realistic
and
will
restrain
myself
pours
pitch
black
almost
opaque
with
a
beautiful
one
inch
caramel
colored
head
smells
only
of
raisins
and
alcohol
first
sip
is
bittersweet
raisins
with
a
ton
of
tobacco
and
burnt
malty
dark
fruits
bitter
from
start
to
finish
i
have
never
had
a
beer
with
this
much
tobacco
flavor
d
drinking
a
bomber
of
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
ultimately
i
find
the
sweetness
a
bit
much
but
thats
just
my
beef
with
the
style
rather
than
this
beer
itself
just
a
great
baltic
porter
the
best
ive
had
so
far
a
very
drinkable
beer
from
smuttynose
this
was
one
of
my
first
experiences
with
them
and
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
taste
is
as
described
on
the
bottlevery
robust
and
rich
dark
roasted
malt
up
front
there
is
a
slight
fruity
aspect
like
berries
and
it
finishes
sweet
a
little
syruppy
on
the
mouthfeel
but
nothing
that
detracts
in
any
significant
way
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
and
breathes
and
is
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night

this
one
really
looked
great
in
the
glass
rich
black
to
brown
with
a
browntan
foamy
head
that
disappeared
fairly
quickly
smell
of
chocolate
smoke
and
raisins
in
the
nose
and
the
initial
taste
is
both
rich
roasted
malt
and
a
somewhat
bitter
nutty
taste
that
balances
the
very
dark
roast
in
the
nose
and
ends
with
a
sudden
burst
of
smoke
like
a
campfire
in
the
mouth
and
nose
very
different
complex
and
definitely
one
of
those
you
want
to
savor
and
sip
tasted
great
no
matter
the
temperature
of
the
beer
the
unique
lager
process
was
obvious
in
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
but
the
smoke
taste
was
after
half
a
glass
a
bit
much
enjoyable
but
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
have
liked
the
alcohol
wasnt
noticeable
with
the
slower
pace
i
was
drinking
but
i
noticed
after
30
minutes
or
so
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
baltic
porter
i
certainly
enjoy
okocim
zywiec
and
baltika
but
this
is
not
that
similar
very
good
stuff
a
fantastic
beer
im
really
enjoying
the
big
beer
series
from
smuttynose
kudos
distribute
to
california
now
thanks
go
vote
this
is
starting
to
remind
me
of
some
favorite
baltic
porters
of
mine
though
it
still
tastes
too
much
like
ashtray
dark
brown
color
but
appears
black
in
the
glass
very
large
frothy
and
well
developed
dark
tan
head
vibrant
nose
but
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
still
has
some
pleasant
notes
of
chocolate
covered
raisins
flavor
is
very
complex
with
notes
of
chocolate
pit
fruit
toffee
and
a
touch
of
coffee
very
nice
finish
as
well
on
this
bad
boy
this
is
an
excellent
baltic
porter
and
may
be
my
favorite
from
the
big
beer
series
with
the
imperial
stout
giving
it
a
run
for
its
money
this
could
be
my
new
favorite
domestic
baltic
porter
thanks
for
another
great
beer
derek
d
the
booze
is
present
but
doesnt
plod
into
the
taste
the
parallels
between
this
beer
and
russian
imperial
stouts
are
amazing
if
i
didnt
know
better
based
on
the
label
idve
rated
this
as

i
need
to
grab
some
more
next
time
im
in
ny
other
than
imperial
stout
i
havent
been
blown
away
by
any
of
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
baltic
porter
not
only
gives
the
stout
a
run
for
its
money
it
just
might
be
the
best
beer
that
this
brewery
has
released
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
access
buy
all
you
can
carry
in
fact
taking
a
pack
horse
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
fairly
bitter
this
one
actually
no
sign
of
smokiness
but
plenty
of
caramelized
ose
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
higherpowered
porter
to
drink
for
a
while
but
its
definitely
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
pounder
still
not
bad
id
recommend
it
i
found
this
pretty
enjoyable
i
bought
this
bottle
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
impressive
this
is
definitely
on

works

goes
to
show
why
i
continue
to
love
this
style
more
and
more
appears
a
pitch

this

aromatics
are

nearly
burnt

reaches
the

as
well
as
the
last

find
my

i
detect
a
toasted
nuttiness
and
herbal
mint
quality
flavors
equally
if
not
more
so
impressively
mind
blowing
starts
off
big
and
sweet
with
malt
and
fruit
characteristics
plum
and
raisins
namingly
after
the
sweetness
descends
along
comes
more
burnt
toffee
and
molasses
like
notes
coming
off
rich
and
sugary
yet
fruity
and
complex
as
ever
herbal
bitterness
is
detected
along
the
way
but
a
dry
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
astringency
definitely
land
a
trademark
on
the
overall
flavor
profile
a
slow
charred
oak
alcohol
burn
brings
to
mind
the
finest
single
malts
aged
to
perfection
warming
in
your
gut
and
tingles
the
throat
and
the
sinuses
anise
and
fruit
notes
flow
seamlessly
together
bringing
to
mind
old

italian
cookies
that

mouthfeel
is
big
and
chewy
coats
the
palate
with
pure
girth
loads
of
malt
equal
great
texture
and
the
yeast
sediment
in
this
bottle
conditioned
version
really
gives
it
some
redeeming
qualities
drinkability
is
effortless
despite
the
complexity
and
pure
amount
of
body
this
beer
has
to
offer
all
aspects
are
a
cohesive
driving
force
in
providing
balance
and
smoothness
in
an
intense
usually
abrasive
style
when
done
right
however
like
heavyweight
perkunos
sinebrychoff
and
okocim
this
style
provides
pure
bliss
of
course
this
year
was
hyped
with
this
style
victory
brought
the
hammer
back
with
their
version
of
the
style
as
the
widespread
knowledge
of
that
release
occurred
and
people
vied
for
a
taste
of
it
this
small
adventurous
brewer
from
new
hampshire
decided
to
nail
the
style
completely
so
by
chance
this
perfect
version
of
the
style
was
brewed
and
barely
noticed
while
most
beer
folks
lined
up
in
anticipation
for
a
taste
of
perkunos
in
victorys
version
this
is
baltic
porter
in
all
its
glory
if
you
find
a
bottle
snatch
it
up
and
sit
on
it
or
drink
it
now
thats
up
to
you
bottom
line
i
need
more
big
beers
from
smuttynose
send
them
to
the
burgh
god
knows
we
need
some
big
a
ipa
bring
on
the
hops

dissolves
quickly
into
a
light
lacing

tremendous
smell
of
mocha
dark

coffee
the
taste
is
very
rich

is
also
a
taste
of
coffee

espresso
lurking
in
the
beer
that
finishes
with
some
excellent
sweetness
of
dark
chocolate
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
light
creaminess
and
low
carbonation
which
adds
to
a
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice

easily

matter
what
happen
to
this
brew
i
dont
think
this
will
taste
much
like
the
classic
baltic
porters
that
taste
more
like
a
mixture
of
fine
red
wine
and
chocolate
give
it
some
time
i
suppose
and
enjoy
what
might
be
more
accurately
called
a
baltic
stout
prost
drinks
great
for
the
style
abv
a
great
baltic
porter
smutty
is
probably
my
favorite
new
england
brewery
can
hold
their
own
with
of
the
big
boys
overall
i
thought
this
was
really
excellent
i
was
shocked
to
see
it
rated
so
high
but
now
that
i
get
to
try
it
i
would
whole
heartedly
agree
with
this
assumption
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
a
very
solid
brewer
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
again
it
was
really
very
good
and
very
easy
to
sip
this
was
a
breeze
a
great
example
of
the
style
d
a
nice
baltic
porter
that
is
very
true
to
style
excellent
if
i
see
another
one
out
there
i
would
grab
it
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
of
toffee
chocolate
caramel
and
roast
taste
of
chocolate
toffee
and
dark
fruit
has
a
bitter
but
not
overwhelming
coffee
finish
velvety
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
another
winner
from
smuttynose
excellent
beer
drinkability
waas
only
ok
i
may
not
have
served
it
quite
as
cool
as
it
should
have
been
but
it
was
still
at
about
60
degrees
f
which
is
my
cellar
temperature
throughout
the
summer
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
i
have
tasted
and
i
would
seek
this
one
out
highly
recommended
the
taste
roasted
malt
is
nicely
done
here
followed
by
notes
of
coffee
caramel
and
dark
fruit
the
flavours
are
really
big
but
im
surprised
how
smooth
the
overall
drinking
experience
is
mind
you
the
abv
is
right
up
there
where
it
belongs
for
the
style
but
i
still
find
it
quite
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
shows
itself
as
just
some
warming
after
the
swallow
its
pretty
close
to
being
full
bodies
and
the
carbonation
id
say
is
about
medium
the
finish
has
a
nice
bitter
coffee
finish
that
lasts
for
quite
a
while
i
like
sipping
on
this
one
and
it
will
probably
take
me
a
while
to
finish
the
bottle
not
a
negative
comment
regarding
its
drinkability
more
of
a
i
dont
want
to
see
the
end
of
the
contents
of
the
bottle
thats
always
a
good
thing
i
think
smuttynose
did
one
hell
of
a
job
here
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
brew
from
smuttynose
pitch
black
with
no
carbonation
whatsoever
and
nothing
more
than
a
thin
pond
scum
head
nose
was
strong
black
licorice
anise
taste
reflects
the
nose
anise
like
black
licorice
a
very
fat
fing
brew
in
the
nose
ditto
for
the
mouthfeel
nuff
said
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
much
prefer
it
on
tap
since
the
nose
and
body
are
fuller
and
smoother
than
what
comes
out
in
a
bomber
its
a
good
but
not
great
interpreation
of
the
style
big
flavor
and
big
alcohol
but
it
drinks
incredibly
well
luxuriously
smooth
and
a
total
pleasure
try
to
give
it
time
and
warming
my
first
one
was
merely
okthis
time
its
hitting
all
the
right
spots
the
way
most
other
smuttynose
stuff
does
and
certainly
right
in
line
with
the
high
quality
of
the
other
beers
in
the
big
beer
series
seek
it
out
di
am
starting
to
love
baltic
porters
and
wish
that
more
craft
brewers
were
taking
on
the
style
baltics
are
a
wonderful
relaxation
sipping
beer
and
this
one
hits
it
spot
on
for
the
most
part
add
in
some
brandy
barrel
aging
and
this
one
would
be
phenomenal
cheers
d
very
tasty
easy
drinking
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
a
pretty
good
take
on
it
one
hell
of
a
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sugary
sweet
up
front
with
bitter
cocoa
ripe
fruit
and
toasted
nuts
lingering
very
good
baltic
porter
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
a
fine
offering
from
smuttynose
well
worth
seeking
out
d
warming
my
stomach
as
i
write
this
and
ive
only
had
a
few
sips
definitely
a
bottle
to
work
on
in
a
recliner
over
a
rental
or
as
if
youre
like
me
saturday
night
live
the
body
is
big
with
a
robust
texture
light
carbonation
feel
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
should
age
very
nicely
22
oz
bottle
conditioned
in
2008
and
brewed
with
lager
yeast
the
beer
pours
quite
black
topped
with
a
three
finger
chocolatey
brown
head
of
medium
froth
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
and
leaves
a
few
wisps
of
lace
it
sits
in
the
glass
with
a
regal
air
giving
the
impression
of
an
imperial
stout
in
the
nose
there
is
a
lager
cleanliness
with
lots
of
dark
malts
a
dash
of
leafy
hops
and
some
late
anise
on
the
palate
theres
a
big
blast
of
chocolate
roasted
and
black
malts
that
lend
an
espresso
astringency
along
with
some
leafyfloral
and
oily
hops
that
impart
a
mild
bitterness
eventually
dark
chocolatecovered
raisins
emerge
riding
the
warming
never
hot
alcohol
all
the
way
down
on
the
palate
it
almost
feels
too
thick
to
be
a
lager
silky
smooth
with
fine
carbonation
again
reminiscent
of
an
imperial
stout
a
great
lager
and
one
of
the
meatiest
i
have
ever
come
across
it
starts
very
malty
but
the
hops
gradually
emerge
the
flavor
is
so
close
to
a
five
but
it
falls
just
a
tad
near
the
end
regardless
one
sip
just
begs
for
another
and
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
seek
out
overall
the
baltic
porter
is
a
great
offering
from
smuttynose
rich
and
complex
but
amazingly
drinkable
dangerously
so
at
8
7
abv
the
downside
is
this
was
a
limited
release
so
if
you
werent
able
to
score
any
of
the
bombers
out
there
on
the
market
you
are
out
of
luck
unless
maybe
you
can
find
a
willing
ba
trader
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
stumble
across
it
in
a
store
or
if
you
are
even
luckier
and
find
it
on
tap
this
is
a
must
have
this
baltic
porter
pours
thick
and
syrupy
deep
black
with
a
thin
medium
brown
head
the
color
of
coffee
with
1
cream
the
first
aroma
i
got
was
malty
along
with
hints
of
molassesraisins
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
malts
in
a
good
way
there
were
also
tastes
of
coffee
and
cocoa
mixed
in
you
taste
this
and
know
its
a
baltic
the
mouthfeel
was
suprisingly
sharp
for
a
porter
at
first
but
mellowed
a
bit
throughout
the
glass
although
it
was
a
nice
feeling
that
along
with
the
abv
kind
of
rule
this
out
for
a
session
beer
but
delicious
to
have
one
or
two
great
offering
from
the
smutty
big
beer
series
final
note
last
time
i
was
at
the
beer
store
3
days
ago
there
were
23
more
of
these
left
on
the
shelf
i
bought
the
first
one
and
im
going
back
for
more
deep
dark
black
in
color
with
a
nice
sized
cocoa
head
on
top
moderate
amount
of
aroma
black
currants
and
mellow
chocolate
tinge
has
a
somewhat
faint
inky
smell
to
it
heavy
dark
chocolate
flavor
great
taste
of
anise
and
roasted
malt
not
overly
harsh
or
astringent
ever
so
slight
espresso
and
quite
grainy
good
mouthfeel
a
decent
baltic
porter
a
style
that
more
brewers
need
to
try
well
worth
trying
for
sure
in
addition
having
a
bottle
almost
one
year
later
from
the
vintage
and
its
just
beautiful
amazing
beer
more
spot
on
interpretation
after
it
gains
some
age
highly
suggested
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
this
beer
is
good
happy
imperial
beering
drinkability
is
good
i
have
yet
to
have
been
let
down
by
any
of
the
smutty
offerings
and
this
one
doesnt
let
me
down
either
probably
second
only
to
duckrabbit
when
it
comes
to
baltic
porters
that
i
have
sampled
this
is
a
chewy
beer
no
better
way
to
describe
it
its
rich
thick
and
very
very
flavorful
dark
chocolate
combined
with
rich
maltiness
and
a
nice
bitter
taste
of
coffee
and
hints
of
licorice
they
really
did
a
great
job
with
this
new
release
it
will
be
something
to
look
forward
to
each
january
from
now
on
very
rich
and
flavorful
pours
a
one
finger
light
brown
head
that
goes
quickly
and
leaves

for

too

a
seasonal
brew
i
would
like
to
drink
this
all

round

for

5
or

a
bomber
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
is
one
im
always
into
purchasing
for
the
most
part
ive
yet
to
be
even
mildly
disappointed
and
this
brew
is
no
different
this
seems
a
style
that
a
lot
of
breweries
are
trying
which
is
great
since
you
need
some
deviation
from
the
ris
every
once
in
a
while
certainly
an
awesome
sipper
for
a
cold
evening
and
one
that
i
highly
recommend
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
that
you
barely
see
through
the
pour
a
full
finger
stiff
tan
colored
head
fades
slowly
to
sheets
of
lacing
some
3d
the
smell
is
an
aggressive
creamy
tootsie
roll
chocolate
with
a
light
roasted
malt
character
nicely
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
creamy
and
silky
smooth
with
a
slight
tingle
of
alcohol
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
full
flavored
the
sweet
chocolate
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
smell
and
complemented
nicely
by
the
feel
there
is
a
lightly
chewy
milk
chocolate
after
taste
that
lingers
nicely
the
alcohol
is
integrated
well
yet
provides
a
subtle
warmth
on
the
way
down
way
too
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
rich
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
prickly
with
tiny
bubbles
from
the
good
carbonation
semidry
finish
warming
effect
in
the
belly
extremely
tasty
and
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
ahhh
smuttynose
overall
an
experience
theres
plenty
to
like
her
for
the
dark
beer
lover
though
not
a
style
for
a
weak
palate
lots
of
nuance
and
discreet
alcohol
for
such
a
bomb
try
alongside
something
sweet
and
creamy
a
mocha
cheescake
or
a
plain
one
with
red
fruit
on
top
maybe
even
just
the
fruit
with
some
chocolate
white
drinkability
great
drinkability
not
too
rough
on
the
palate
but
a
sipper
in
my
opinion
overall
a
pretty
good
baltic
porter
from
smuttynose
curious
how
this
would
be
with
a
little
age
on
it
finish
is
a
little
hot
which
hurts
the
alcohol
despite
the
apparent
lack
of
hops
it
does
not
come
off
as
cloyingly
sweet
some
time
with
this
one
may
smooth
things
out
but
it
is
still
undeniably
enjoyable
worthy
of
a
russian
or
new
jersey
winter
evening
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
black
and
chocolate
malt
scent
that
warms
even
the
nose
this
is
one
intense
beer
the
taste
is
perfect
this
one
is
black
to
the
max
its
rich
and
smooth
going
down
with
bitter
black
malt
flavor
it
warms
a
bit
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
the
best
baltic
ive
ever
tried
it
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
a
truely
balls
out
beer
god
bless
america
cheers
a
big
flavorful
porter
slightly
out
of
balance
but
pretty
damn
good
anyway
i
can
only
imagine
this
would
get
better
with
time
this
is
a
great
offering
very
full
sweet
and
rich
character
a
good
example
of
the
style
worth
having
around
and
most
definitely
worth
looking
out
for
as
dark
as
brown
can
be
without
being
black
and
opaque
this
one
has
a
nice
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
great
lace
very
nice
to
look
at
nose
is
coffee
with
cream
chocolate
roasted
grain
and
faint
hop
goodness
very
nice
indeed
taste
exhibits
the
same
and
the
lager
yeast
definitely
plays
a
part
giving
it
a
weird
edge
in
the
finish
and
mouthfeel
very
full
and
creamy
but
not
overboard
very
drinkable
abv
isnt
posted
anywhere
and
i
dont
detect
much
booze
in
the
taste
smuttynose
steps
it
up
on
this
one
although
im
comparing
a
baltic
porter
to
a
ris
i
would
say
it
could
possibly
be
called
the
poor
mans
kate
the
great
i
dont
know
just
buy
it
and
enjoy
delicious
drinkability
superb
i
had
this
alongside
the
new
victory
baltic
porter
for
a
tasting
comparison
and
this
one
was
far
superior
imho
even
though
the
victory
version
was
also
good
an
absolute
must
have
for
all
bas
this
is
my
new
favorite
in
the
smutty
big
beer
series
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
pretty
dark
full
head
on
it
smells
of
sweet
malt
coffee
and
smoke
tastes
similar
i
really
like
this
beer
this
is
something
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
too
bad
its
only
around
for
a
bit
definitely
going
to
put
a
few
of
these
in
my
cellar
i
need
to
stock
up
on
this
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
creamy
and
full
bodied
very
chewy
and
filling
i
do
so
wish
smuttynose
was
local
to
me
this
is
another
winner
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
for
a
while
now
pours
a
very
deep
black
with
a
lightly
tanned
head
that
lasts
smell
is
big
on
roasty
burnt
coffee
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
with
some
fruit
in
the
middle
bottom
line
is
that
the
bitter
coffee
takes
center
stage
with
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
in
the
realm
between
medium

this

visit
from

and
smuttynose
has
once
again
proved
itself
worthy
of
it
not

best
from
their

still
remarkable

i
remember

still
if

can
see
this

of

with
a
thin

that
doesnt
stick
around
long
but
does
leave
some
nice

on
the

aroma
is
sweet
almost
a
lactose
sweet
smell
with
some
roasted
grain
coffee
and
some
faint
raisin
in
there
too
the
taste
hits
you
with
a
lot
at

i
got
some
hops
then
chocolate
then
coffee
then
some
alcohol
roasty
bitterness
in
the
end
sits
in
your
gullet
just
begging
you
to
take
another

mouthfeel

this
is
an
excellent
brew
i
better
buy
up
some
more
before
they
are
all
gone
great

too
another
excellent
brew
from
smuttynose
i
love
this
brewery
poured
slowly
into

is
this
a
porter
or
a
stout
haha
very
thin
brown

with
no

smells
of
chocolate
coffee
and
a
little
rasin
nothing
too
strong
overall

is
really
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
giving
this
an
a
taste
is
unreal
creamy
milk
chocolate
initially
with
roasted

as
it
goes
down
flavor
stayed
in
my
mouth
for
what
seemed
like
forever
so
smooth
and
delicious
i
wish
i
had
another
this
is
a
real
bargain
at
only
3

for
a
bomber
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
it
pours
almost
black
with
a
great
pillow
head
and
great

is
an
excellent
blend
of
smoky

raisins
molasses
taste
is
smoky

on

a
treat
to
the

mouthfeel
is
creamy

with
a
dry

drinkability
is
extremely
smooth
especially
for
a
baltic
porter
put
this
one
in
my
top
10
this
is
a
brilliant
heady
brew
that
is
just
right
for
this
classic

overall
good

too
much
roasted

and
not
enough
tartness
and
average
feel
o
lots
of
raisinfig
sweetness
mixed
with
big
barrel
notes
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
is
an
older
keg
as
the
beers
has
a
stake
taste
that
ive
experienced
from
ba
beers
that
sit
too
long
after
bottling
beatiuful
outstanding
beer
im
absolutely
in
love
its
full
body
is
lightened
considerably
by
the
ample
carbonation
to
keep
the
ale
creamy
and
aloft
stern
alcohol
warmth
amplifies
the
spiciness
of
the
porter
and
highlights
its
oaky
tannins
and
sultry
bourbon
caramels
and
vanillans
flavor
is
leather
cocoa
toasted
malt
butter
and
a
roasty
lightly
bitter
fairly
boozy
that
damn
diacetyl
comes
back
too
prevalently
the
taste
is
very
good
with
semiburnt
sugar
flavor
and
dark
toasted
grain
with
slight
mineral
aspect
in
the
yeast
with
slight
caramel
taste
mid
palate
and
gentle
woody
accent
adding
to
the
complexity
with
a
mostly
dry
finish
in
general
easy
to
quaff
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
on
the
style
with
wonderfully
tasty
profile
with
not
too
much
barrel
character

3
years

this

very

i

how
full

the
mouthfeel
is
considering
the
abv
is
only
8
this
is
truly
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
barrel
characteristics
as
supposedly
its
12
months
in
a
barrel
overall
excellent
beer
with
a
near
perfect
blend
of
hops
residual
sugar
and
alcohol
content
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
perfect
for
sipping
over
a
long
time
the
alcohol
content
is
high
but
not
off
the
charts
and
nearly
completely
disguised
it
is
an
imperial
but
is
not
overwhelming
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
it
get
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
taste
fullish

creamy
woody
mild
vanilla
hint

unsweetened
dark

charred

dark

semidry

finish
overall
its
a
great
baltic
porter
as
i
recall
this
is
probably
only
a
few
of
the
baltic
porters
i
tried
i
cant
help
but
find
a
lot
of
similarities
between
this
and
black
ipas
with
the
exception
for
the
richness
sea
legs
offer
very
tasty
beer
and
as
far
as
i
know
this
beer
is
seasonal
not
only
brewed
once
as
stated
on
this
website
very
oaky
flavor
though
not
harsh
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
airy
limited
kilning
astringency
hop
flavor
up
front
woody
and
blackcurrant
notes
it
hides
its
alcohol
extremely
well
cheers
imho
do
not
age
this
brew
it
gains
nothing
and
thins
out
after
a
year
taste
is
dry
roasty
malt
with
its
sweet
underpinnings
washes
over
the
palate
with
a
surprising
milky
sweetness
strong
bitter
coffee
dry
bittersweet
chocolate
subtle
vanilla
and
tempting
bourbon
there
is
a
wood
so
light
on
this
that
it
seems
to
be
afloat
weightless
on
the
beer
a
slight
warmth
from
alcohol
as
this
one
finishes
crisp
dry
thinnish
to
the
palate
but
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
with
some
hop
bitter
to
linger
alongside
all
that
smooth
caramel
o
a
good
beer
but
i
remember
it
being
close
to
perfection
on
my
first
try
i
guess
my
taste
has
changed
or
evolved
overall
this
brew
has
some
great
qualities
porters
tend
to
be
thin
bodied
but
this
one
has
a
nice
viscous
feel
the
whiskey
barrel
is
subtle
and
well
played
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
added
worked
out
pretty
well
nice
brew
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
o
its
a
well
done
beer
the
base
beer
shines
through
all
while
letting
the
barrel
treatment
come
forth
but
not
take
over
completely
pours
dark
black
light
tan
foam
top
layer
creamy
chocolate
and
vanilla
nose
coffee
too
smooth
creamy
layered
taste
very
even
modest
if
any
bitter
subtle
bourbon
taste
at
the
close
alcohol
picks
up
steam
light
cream
good
this
seems
to
be
what
happens
when
you
drop
a
porter
into
some
american
whiskey
barrels
the
base
beers
robust
im
assuming
here
attributes
while
not
exactly
disappearing
still
have
to
endure
a
large
dose
of
the
ol
thinning
barrel
treatment
yeah
thats
the
flipside
of
the
whiskeycask
aging
coin
if
the
big
caramel
vanilla
and
oak
woodiness
dont
honour
their
paychecks
by
doing
their
song
and
dance
were
left
in
a
fix
not
a
bad
thing
per
se
but
a
reduced
one
all
the
same
poured
an
almost
black
body
with
gushing
head
that
dies
quick
with
an
aroma
of
roasted
malts
that
have
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
beer
is
smooth
and
a
little
oaky
with
the
vanilla
coming
in
real
good
and
sweet
minimal
bourbon
notes
and
chocolate
that
are
balanced
with
roasted
not
smoked
malts
and
there
is
a
slight
slickness
to
the
beer
abv
hidden
and
this
is
an
easy
sipper
that
hits
the
spot
looks
close
to
bba
when
stout
when
poured
with
just
a
slight
bit
thinner
texture
nothing
to
amazing
here
with
the
smell
same
with
the
taste
seems
like
somthing
is
lacking
very
subtle
hints
of
vanilla
almost
no
bourbon
and
barrel
some
char
and
roast
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brownblack
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
really
awesome
thick
creamy
twofinger
plus

which
leaves

the

is
very

with
lots

overall
a
very
nice
brew
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
check
it
out
overall
a
strong
milk
stout
flavor
wise
pretty
much
a
bittersweet
ale
beer
is
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
lightly
foamy
310
and
otherwise
smooth
710
mouthfeel
that
is
very
soft
and
suitable
for
a
higher
ethanolcontent
beer
and
within
expectations
for
the
style
ethanol
is
generally
wellhidden
with
a
subtle
burn
on
the
throat
and
light
heat
in
the
nostrils
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
this
was
nice
will
stash
some
in
the
cellar
and
see
how
they
develop
owas
surprised
to
see
this
beer
was
8
hides
alcohol
beautifully
light
carbonation
round
this
beer
out
even
more
delicious
as
it
warms
i
recommend
it
to
any
beer
enthusiast
great
sipping
brew
but
i
can
see
how
it
is
easy
to
just
down
it
because
the
alcohol
is
so
wellhidden
loved
every
sip
of
this
fine
beer
great
for
a
cold
february
evening
overall
this
is
such
a
big
beer
i
regret
choosing
it
as
the
second
beer
for
the
evening
big
beer
big
mouthfeel
damn
overall
good
solid
beer
doesnt
deviate
too
much
from
a
standard
baltic
porter
it
should
perhaps
be
a
little
sweeter
but
that
aspect
does
begin
to
show
itself
and
gives
this
beer
a
little
more
complexity
worth
a
try
but
if
the
tap
price
is
reflective
of
the
bottle
price
i
could
understand
passing
on
it
o
uinta
has
yet
to
disappoint
sea
legs
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
offering
extremely
wellbalanced
with
the
flavors
from
the
dark
malts
and
oak
barrel
aging
at
8
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
although
the
first
batch
of
sea
legs
ca
20122013
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
the
20132014
batch
is
aged
in
virgin
wooden
vessels
for
those
who
are
fans
of
uintas
oak
jacked
one
my
favorites
ever
i
am
certain
you
would
like
this
despite
the
description
on
the
label
i
did
not
get
any
hints
of
smoke
in
either
the
aroma
or
flavor
great
stuff
and
highly
recommended
o
a
pretty
interesting
complex
subtle
beer
that
opens
up
a
bit
more
with
warming
but
doesnt
have
a
signature
flavor
or
aroma
it
has
a
woody
oaky
note
that
is
pretty
strong
and
adds
a
slight
sourness
and
smokiness
to
the
beer
but
it
works
pretty
well
with
the
musty
molasses
understated
dark
malt
quality
definitely
not
a
dull
beer
and
probably
merits
revisiting
after
a
year
or
two
of
aging
solid
stuff
i
wouldve
liked
to
try
this
one
fresher
but
it
seemed
to
age
alright
its
definitely
a
porter
and
will
not
be
confused
with
a
stout
nice
craftsmanship
with
this
one
odquite
enjoyable
as
a
breakfast
beer
on
a
chillier
morning
i
would
like
a
bit
more
of
the
wood
barrel
in
the
flavor
overall
little
to
bitch
about
with
this
one

make
this

a

a

quite
nice
o

doesnt
fall

of
a

than
i
would

anticipated
however
doesnt

into

realm
and
is

would
definitely
purchase

about

any
guest
youd
invite

your
table
o
uintas
barrel
aged
beers
tend
to
take
the
less
is
more
approach
and
this
one
is
no
exception
a
very
subtle
incorporation
of
the
barrel
means
that
the
wood
takes
on
a
strictly
complementary
role
nice
balance
and
restraint
displayed
here
and
the
beer
benefits
from
it
another
fabulous
beer
from
uinta
in
their
crooked
line
series
poured
this
one
at
a
good
temperature
with
an
enormous
foamy
thick
creamy
fluffy
tan
head
that
settles
so
slowly
and
good
lacing
color
is
a
barely
translucent
black
brown
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
roast
malt
cocoa
old
leather
a
small
amounts
of
coffee
dark
ripe
fruit
tree
bark
earth
body
is
excellent
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
soft
finish
is
like
flavor
slightly
boozy
easy
drinking
o
there
is
a
good
amount
of
complexity
well
balanced
no
single
flavor
really
dominates
and
quite
smooth
an
excellent
sipping
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
could
really
see
this
one
sneaking
up
on
me
o
thiss
beer
is
very
complex
but
is
also
very
balanced
in
the
sense
that
not
one
flavor
stands
out
in
particular
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
completely
hides
the
alcohol
a
fairly
rich
beer
one
that
wanted
to
be
sipped
o
impressed
this
is
a
solidly
put
together
brew
exactly
what
i
would
want
from
a
partially
barrelaged
baltic
porter
all
the
components
of
this
beer
are
very
unified
the
taste
is
smooth
as
hell
with
more
subtle
coffee
tones
plenty
of
malt
upfront
and
a
nice
oak
finish
the
8
7
isnt
even
noticable
the
bottle
date
is
112612
and
is
just
a
really
solid
brew
flavor
brings
easy
drinking
roast
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
vanilla
is
used
with
skill
and
restraint
and
you
almost
have
to
look
for
it
to
find
it
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
desserts
at
a
bakery
some
alcohol
heat
stiffens
the
flavor
up
and
mingles
well
with
the
roasted
bitterness
and
vanilla
sweetness
finishes
dry
and
clean
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
beer
i
expected
a
richer
chocolate
and
a
smoother
taste
with
vanilla
i
switched
glasses
for
a
difference
the
stein
produced
a
smoother
more
malty
taste
but
the
pronounced
tang
remained
o
this
is
a
very
solid
oakaged
baltic
porter
very
imperial
stoutlike
even
at
8
another
toooftenoverlooked
beer
from
a
more
than
solid
lineup
a
la
uintas
crooked
line
overall
i
really
like
this
porter
well
rounded
and
flavorful
the
cork
was
really
hard
to
remove
but
awesome
taste
i
will
have
another
overall
a
decent
sipper
i
think
i
like
it
i
think
overall
another
nice
addition
to
the
crooked
line
series
overall
mixed
it
has
some
great
parts
but
also
off
points
maybe
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
went
too
far
but
if
it
wasnt
for
that
yeasty
and
dank
wood
esters
out
would
be
quite
nice
o
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
with
very
nice
roast
qualities
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
barrel
come
through
but
still
a
damn
good
beer
from
crooked
line
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
porter
its
a
nice
mix
of
complexity
and
drinkability
a
bit
strong
but
also
on
the
light
side
of
mouthfeel
worth
trying
overall
not
a
bad
porter
but
has
more
of
a
stout
feel
to
it
the
7th
beer
ive
tried
in
the
uinta
crooked
line
series
and
possibly
the
best
the
body
is
medium
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
would
gladly
try
it
again
this
is
full
bodied
with
a
fluffy
mouthfeel
this
is
super
delicious
the
only
way
it
could
improve
is
by
being
rarer
a
very
wellmade
baltic
porter
that
melds
well
across
the
board
of
flavor
aroma
and
feel
very
wellbalanced
deeply
complex
and
goes
down
well
while
nipping
at
some
old
forester
signature
bourbon
yes
a
nearly
exceptional
porter
hell
scratch
that
definitely
an
exceptional
porter
really
awesome
aesthetics
beautiful
artwork
of
a
sailor
in
some
dark
weather
meeting
a
mermaid
the
newest
in
the
wonderful
crooked
line
series
and
probably
my
favorite
thing
ive
ever
had
from
uinta
a
oak
aged
baltic
porter
with
all
kinds
of
oaky
and
vanilla
smells
and
flavors
but
very
little
sweetness
its
really
malty
and
thick
less
like
a
porter
and
more
like
a
stout
the
feel
is
amazing
of
this
beer
not
quite
creamy
but
definitely
frothed
its
light
of
its
color
and
thickness
but
isnt
particularly
carbonated
silky
might
be
a
better
way
to
describe
it
the
malt
flavor
is
crazy
roasty
but
without
any
bitterness
and
the
oak
is
fresh
and
clean
not
charred
and
bourbon
laced
but
organic
and
fresh
cut
the
alcohol
is
invisible
and
this
to
me
is
a
sort
of
genre
transcending
brew
its
absolutely
fantastic
its
a
matted
black
color
mysterious
and
deep
and
sitting
in
my
globe
next
to
the
bottle
it
came
from
with
gorgeous
artwork
with
its
milky
foam
head
its
a
sight
to
behold
as
close
to
full
marks
as
i
usually
go
this
beer
is
just
sensation
super
complex
woody
and
neither
sweet
or
bitter
its
a
heck
of
a
combination
and
you
should
not
let
the
price
deter
you
its
magic
best
beer
ive
had
in
awhile
a
top
notch
baltic

a
really
nice
porter
somewhat
less
light
fruit
cherry
flavor
than
im
used
to
from
baltic
porters
but
not
complaining
this
is
really
well
integrated
and
tasty
another
winner
from
uintas
crooked
series
dry
chocolatey

toasted

and
mild

notes
pleasant

straightforward
the

isnt
too
noticeable
very

almost
like
the

an
enjoyable

a
bottle
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
has
most
of
the
typical
notes
that
one
would
expect
from
the
style
but
there
is
an
intense
citrus
character
throughout
i
wont
say
i
didnt
like
it
but
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
once
i
came
around
to
the
blend
of
coffee
citrus
and
some
burnt
sugar
notes
all
blended
together
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
worth
checking

tiger
not
so
tasty
as
i
remember
a
hint
of
plastic
woody
lack
of
boldness
in
any

is
the
only
thing
holding
this
back
from
the
upper

so
far
my
least
favorite
of
the
crooked

which
have
all
been
excellent
overall
a
very
smooth
and
refined
beer
great
for
a

sipping

oreally
good
baltic

its
a
bit
sweeter
an
maybe
more
artificial
than
a
typical
baltic
porter
but
its
still
amazing
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
to
me
its
an
easy
4

brew
fine
example
of
a
nice
wellrounded
porter
sweet
toasty
chocolate
malts
are
perfectly
balanced
by
a
bit
of
cola
black
pepper
some
nice
walnut
and
a
bit
of
spicy
floral
hops
on
the
backside
only
had
this
beer
and
one
oatmeal
stout
from
dark
horse
but
i
will
be
looking
out
for
them
in
the
future
these
guys
seem
to
really
know
their
stouts
it
was
ok
i
would
order
it
again
if
it
were
all
that
was
available
not
dark
horses
best
a
fairly
overrated
beer
id
say
its
definitely
good
but
not
by
any
means
exceptional
the
bottle
opened
with
a
very
strong
rush
of
air
not
a
gusher
but
its
hard
to
pour
without
excessive
head
when
in
the
glass
it
does
look
good
a
toasty
brown
and
black
color
with
a
khaki
head
there
is
something
off
about
the
smell
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
its
a
bit
more
acrid
than
i
would
like
the
taste
is
moderately
roasty
with
some
nice
acidic
notes
tastes
pretty
styleappropriate
to
me
mouthfeel
isnt
up
to
par
the
massive
amounts
of
carbonation
are
overwhelming
the
mediumheavy
body
overall
its
a
miss
not
one
of
dark
horses
best
offerings
i
felt
this
did
not
meet
my
expectations
for
a
baltic
porter
let
alone
a
good
porter
itself
o
very
good
and
drinkable
porter
though
not
necessarily
a
baltic
porter
the
thing
is
and
here
i
go
blowing
my
hot
air
that
it
really
has
the
taste
of
the
other
dark
horse
dark
beers
there
is
something
identifiable
in
the
recipe
that
one
can
specifically
say
is
dark
horse
as
it
is
a
profile
that
they
have
in
their
other
beers
and
that
is
not
to
say
it
is
a
bad
thing
it
is
refreshing
to
drink
something
that
you
know
where
it
came
from
and
it
is
a
trait
that
they
carry
over
from
brewing
to
brewing
and
its
nice
to
have
a
consistent
friend
to
come
back
to
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
fairly
complex
porter
that
disguises
each
note
until
the
beer
warms
up
chocolate
malts
and
brown
sugarmolasses
forward
dark
fruit
and
anise
notes
come
out
in
the
back
end
think
of
a
dried
fruit
covered
in
bakers
chocolate
thin
in
body
yet
creamy
in
mouthfeel
toes
the
line
between
porter
and
stout
quite
well
the
7
is
not
overly
noticeable
here
first
baltic
porter
so
im
not
sure
yet
what
im
looking
for
in
the
style
i
like
cold
black
coffee
flavor
but
it
doesnt
hang
around
wouldnt
mind
a
few
more
of
these
dark
horse
does
it
again
if
you
see
it
buy
it
nice
porter

good

the
late
micheal
jackson
hailed
as
the
original
and
still
greatest
beer
writer
of
all
time
said
of
the
difference
between
stout
and
porter
that
it
was
as
unambiguous
as
a
horoscope
imagine
then
the
difference
amongst
porters
themselves
this
review
should
have
focused
less
on
categorizing
this
beer
and
instead
taking
it
at
face
value
thirsty
trout
is
a
nice
offering
simple
as
that
really
tasty
complex
enough
and
extremely
quaffable
one
of
the
most
thirstquenching
porters
ive
ever
had
i
wonder
if
theres
any
relation
with
the
name
in
this
matter

this
beer
is
like
what
youd
get
if
you
had
an
iced
coffee
with
malts
and
alcohol
but
done
right
its
a
total
campfire
sit
and
roast
marshmallows
cuddle
up
and
read
a
book
i
sound
like
a
friggin
girl
or
comfortably
watch
macguyver
there
we
go
thats
more
manlike
beer
its
very
roasted
very
chocolatecoffee
and
very
dark
beer
all
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
nice
porter
with
a
smooth
creamy
taste
very
malty
smell
dark
dark
black
pour
with
little
head
mmm
nice
smokey
taste
easy
on
the
taste
buds
lots
if
roasty
malts
i
like
it
o
a
good
porter
tasty
but
i
wish
the
flavors
were
at
the
level
of
the
nose
great
malt
character
with
a
nice
balance
between
chocolate
and
roast
though
chocolate
outshines
the
roast
the
nutty
toasted
malt
is
a
nice
treat
the
dark
fruit
adds
interesting
complexity
becomes
a
touch
metallic
late
a
vigorous
pour
led
to
a
pseudocascade
which
settled
into
a
finger
of
frothy
deeptan
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
srm
44
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
was
very
roasty
with
a
deep
charcoal
aspect
say
is
the
trout
a
stout
hmmm
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
very
much
of
charcoal
and
dark
chocolate
finish
was
semidry
with
the
roastiness
leaving
a
bitter
smoky
flavor
as
its
aftertaste
this
beer
leaves
me
with
a
conundrum
since
it
is
not
really
what
i
would
consider
a
porter
but
more
towards
a
stout
i
did
not
dislike
it
but
it
was
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
either
i
guess
that
you
will
have
to
try
one
and
gauge
it
for
yourself
overall
not
the
greatest
dark
horse
offering
but
good
as
a
one
off
this
is
a
complex
rich
wellbalanced
porter
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
abv
wellmade
and
certainly
enjoyable
overall
a
solid
take
on
a
baltic
porter
good
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
o
very
good
baltic
porter
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
but
a
little
more
booze
might
have
done
it
some
good
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
with
this
but
the
end
result
just
didnt
pan
out
either
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
or
i
got
an
infected
batch
either
way
i
wont
be
visiting
this
one
again
good
complex
porter
as
they
go
this
one
features
some
vanilla
and
some
spice
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
nice
twist
on
the
classic
style
its
dark
but
still
lets
some
light
in
to
give
it
the
faintest
amber
glow
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
much
head
on
it
but
its
got
a
creamy
enough
mouthfeel
and
i
dont
wish
for
more
carbonation
at
all
its
only
mildly
bitter
in
the
finish
with
subtle
spice
wafting
throughout
earthy
malt
vibe
not
as
dark
as
some
and
certainly
not
as
full
bodied
i
also
get
a
lager
yeast
vibe
especially
in
the
crisped
up
finish
but
maybe
my
palate
is
playing
tricks
on
me
a
good
porter
overall
on
par
with
the
other
quality
dark
horse
brews
but
this
one
didnt
stand
out
to
me
the
way
some
of
the
others
did
maybe
just
a
little
light
for
the
style
in
winter
time
its
a
porter
but
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
heft
or
build
a
baltic
porter
ought
to
its
mildly
dry
off
some
char
carbonation
and
crispness
are
kept
in
check
and
while
it
could
use
a
bit
of
a
more
wellrounded
smoothness
it
isnt
lacking
too
much
o
easy
drinking
baltic
porter
nothing
memorable
about
it
good
porter
big
flavors
its
got
some
interesting
qualities
for
a
baltic
porter
but
even
though
this
isnt
a
prefered
style
of
mine
there
are
others
that
i
would
probably
choose
over
it
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
good
roast
profile
with
a
touch
of
smoke
upfront
hearty
for
a
basic
porter
but
a
touch
light
for
a
baltic
broinlaw
comes
through
with
this
brilliant
porter
from
dh
the
beer
rated
low
on
appearance
because
there
wasnt
a
decent
head
present
nor
did
it
lace
the
smell
and
taste
however
were
very
good
the
scent
had
dark
roast
chocolate
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
yet
bitter
somewhat
like
the
semisweet
chocolates
used
for
chocolate
chip
cookies
the
mouthfeel
was
full
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
porter
sessionable
for
sure
to
the
point
nothing
special
a
serviceable
porter
o
any
beer
that
i
can
pick
up
a
lot
of
licorice
flavors
in
is
likely
to
get
a
big
fat
meh
from
me
the
only
reason
this
doesnt
is
because
of
how
damn
drinkable
it
is
even
still
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
in
the
future
o
pretty
good
porter
but
nothing
earthshattering
going
on
here
o
theres
nothing
groundbreaking
about
this
beer
at
all
but
that
doesnt
make
it
bad
by
any
means
i
could
see
myself
going
back
to
it
if
i
saw
it
on
draft
which
i
never
will
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
it
again
in
bottle
form
o
great
baltic
porter
dark
horse
continues
to
impress
me
with
all
they
put
out
very
dark
chestnut
color
with
only
a
slender
creamy
line
of
a
head
aromas
of
salted
dark
chocolate
caramel
nuts
and
berries
rich
malty
flavor
transitioning
to
dark
fruitiness
sweetened
coffee
tobacco
molasses
faint
licorice
caramelized
sugar
and
vanilla
bean
dry
in
the
finish
and
creamy
but
thinner
than
expected
a
very
tasty
bigish
porter
and
yet
another
malty
success
from
dark
horse
notes
despite
this
one
being
seven
percent
its
very
drinkable
cheers
the
scent
it
mostly
burnt
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
char
the
taste
does
not
follow
as
strong
charred
malts
and
coffee
sit
on
the
tongue
the
feel
it
very
smooth
and
a
touch
dry
its
light
but
charismatic
overall
a
nice
bp
in
my
opinion
it
good
to
see
more
breweries
try
this
style
out
as
compared
with
the
eastern
european
breweries
this
is
a
nice
porter
it
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
that
is
intricate
but
simple
the
body
offers
great
drinkability
overall
a
good
wellrounded
porter
it
probably
wont
please
everybody
but
for
me
this
is
a
porter
i
would
go
back
to
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
porter
i
like
getting
tons
of
roast
malt
in
the
flavours
and
nose
of
the
porters
i
drink
and
this
delivers
in
that
regard
for
the
most
part
its
a
good
solid
porter
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
it
was
a
bit
creamier
and
thicker
id
consider
putting
it
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
porters
like
eddy
fitz
even
though
they
are
in
different
beer
styles

a
good
temperature
with

that
soon
settles
to
a
light
cover
that
lasts

is
an
opaque

brown
aroma
is

roast
dark

molasses
cocoa
flavors
like
nose
with
all
the
above
characteristics
amplified
plus
the
integration
of
sweet
carbonic
tang
and
bitter
body
is
good
but
carbonation
seems
a
little
light
finish
is
like
flavor
longish
and
a
touch
boozy
at
this
point
ive
had
enough
baltic
porters
from
both
sides
of
the
pond
to
know
the
difference
this
one
is
thick
as
it
should
be
that
someone
berry
kind
of
robust
sweetness
is
there
smooth
feel
minimal
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
not
bad
more
like
a
milk
stout
than
baltic
porter
but
still
fairly
tasty
and
drinkable
nice
robustness
just
a
bit
light
overall
feel
and
carbonation
overall
another
great
beer
from
dark
horse
in
a
way
if
made
me
remember
how
good
the
series
of
the
four
beers
are
12

is

alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight

noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
very
nice
flavor
balance
and
robustness
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
it
call
came
together
nicely
with
this
beer
and
its
just
how
a
good
baltic
porter
should
be
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
with
lots
of
nice
roasted
flavors
that
really
held
my
attention
and
the
alcohol
was
hardly
noticeable
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
of
these
it
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
have
by
the
campfire
one
of
the
most
drinkable
baltic
porters
i
have
tried
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
and
how
drinkable
it
was
those
aspects
really
made
this
a
nice
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
was
nothing
that
i
thought
was
out
of
place
or
needed
to
be
improved
on
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
nice
and
roasty
beer
i
consider
it
a
bargain
for
189
and
you
can
be
sure
that
i
will
be
stocking
up
on
some
in
the
near
future
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
porters
and
stouts
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
its
one
damn
good
baltic
porter
and
i
would
put
it
right
up
there
with
bridge
brew
works
baltic
porter
as
my
favorite
of
the
style
they
are
both
very
good
but
this
one
is
a
little
more
drinkable
dark
horse
can
make
some
pretty
damn
good
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
im
glad
they
finally
decided
to
bottle
this
its
a
great
addition
to
their
lineup
and
it
will
be
a
great
addition
to
my
fridge
great
works
guys
this
ones

enough
aroma
is
nice

the
brew
smells
like
roasted

chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
it
tastes
like
roasted
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
and
some
licorice
the
aroma
is
sweet
but
the
bitter
roastiness
really
shows
up
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
id
definitely
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
dark
horse
lives
up
to
its
name
so
much
good
stuff
coming
out
of
sleepy
marshall
mi
maybe
its
just
first
impression
but
i
love
this
beer
tastedark
toasted
malt
faint
coffee
smooth
easy
finish
more
of
a
classic
porter
taste
than
a
baltic
porter
but
a
nice
offering
nonetheless
nice
example
of
the
baltic
porter
style
but
it
doesnt
exactly
stand
out
its
traditional
and
well
executed
just
a
little
one
note
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
chewy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
wellcrafted
albeit
fairly
standard
porter
id
drink
this
again
but
theres
definitely
some
better
ones
out
there
o
this
beer
tastes
a
little
heavier
bodied
compared
to
regular
porters
but
is
very
drinkable
when
compared
to
other
types
of
baltic
porters
where
thirsty
trout
draws
in
inspiration
from
several
porter
sources
it
doesnt
really
resonate
with
the
palate
as
a
baltic
porter
any
more
as
it
does
for
american
porters
robust
porters
or
english
brown
porters
but
it
is
a
pleasant
flavor
profile
that
makes
it
a
joy
to
drink
m
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
appears
almost
black
with
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
as
i
drink
the
glass
milk
chocolate
in
the
aroma
slightly
roasty
taste
thicker
body
lower
carbonation
id
say
its
to
style
as
a
baltic
porter
id
drink
it
again
o
i
like
this
a
good
deal
dark
horse
seems
to
make
stouts
and
porters
that
are
geared
to
my
tastebuds
id
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
memories
of
somehow
drugfree
arguments
about
spongebob
episodes
come
to
mind
here
how
can
a
trout
be
thirsty
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
straight
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
both
dark
and
syrup
molasses
and
roasted
malts
this
stuff
smells
damn
fine
i
tell
you
what
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dark
chocolate
powder
roasted
malts
light
coffee
very
light
molasses
and
a
kiss
of
maple
syrup
the
body
is
a
sortalightmedium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
generally
smooth
feel
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
porter
one
i
wish
i
could
find
regularly
in
bottles
out
here
lets
go
dark
horse
very
dark
nearly
opaque
black
body
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lacing
not
much
carbonation
but
about
as
expected
for
a
growler
the
pint
i
had
at
the
pub
was
a
bit
more
lively
but
not
much
slightly
toasty
coffee
malty
flavor
well
balanced
not
really
what
i
would
call
a
baltic
porter
but
a
very
good
beer
first
draft
on
site
at
dark
horse
and
its
a
pretty
good
start
poured
in
a
pint
glass
right
up
to
the
rim
with
very
little
head
yet
it
lingers
a
bit
solid
coffee
and
malty
roast
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
light
hop
as
well
very
easy
drinking
even
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
sweltermouthfeel
is
chewy
and
light
at
the
same
timemalt
coffee
and
roast
settle
and
linger
in
the
mouthsame
hop
spice
on
the
tongue
nice
beer
that
would
be
better
on
a
cooler
day
or
with
a
bit
more
ac
in
the
bar
this
pitch
black
7
porter
is
more
than
worth
the
effort
but
moved
on
for
the
next
pint
on
tap
at
hop
cat
in
g
r
very
murky
dark
brown
pour
not
a
substantial
off
white
head
sticks
to
the
glass
ever
so
slightly
rich
malt
aroma
with
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
less
roast
taste
does
kind
of
match
that
with
some
earthy
peat
and
tobacco
but
quite
a
bit
of
molasses
and
chocolate
barely
enough
bitterness
in
the
finish
just
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
the
only
thing
preventing
an
excepetional
in
drinkability
is
the
slight
over
sweetness
otherwise
well
worth
trying
this
had
a
tough
road
to
hoe
following
a
founders
kbs
so
another
good
brew
from
dark
horse
more
of
a
porter
slash
brown
than
a
baltic
porter
on
tap
at
hopcat
brown
with
carbonation
bubbles
average
mouthfeel
malty
licorice
brown
taste
a
little
roast
more
licorice
than
chocolate
and
a
tad
coffee
much
better
at
the
brewery
better
mouthfeel
anyway
its
a
nice
black
with
slight
ruby
hints
and
a
thin
brown
head
nose
is
malty
molasses
with
almond
vanilla
and
maybe
even
slight
cardamom
quite
delicious
the
taste
is
mild
malts
some
hops
nowhere
near
the
complexity
of
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nice
brew
d
i
am
hoping
that
i
do
not
finish
the
whole
growler
tonight
but
hell
that
is
just
a
good
reason
to
make
the
trip
right
poured
from
growler
into
snifter
glass
and
about
an
inch
of
creamy

beer
itself
is

i
hold
it

a

not
spectacular
porter
pours
out
to
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
slight
head
despite
the
slight
head
carbonation
is
fairly
active
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
that
of
malted
milk
balls
the
taste
interesting
there
is
a
definite
coffeeexpresso
taste
present
that
borders
on
burnt
coffee
and
finishes
as
such
bringing
down
its
drinkability
score
to
the
average
range
drinkability
is
solid
but
wateriness
makes
it
an
unspectacular
offering
this
one
was
super
dark
in
appearance
and
the
head
was
almost
totally
absent
from
my
vigorous
pour
where
is
the
carbonation
the
smell
is
intense
roastiness
the
taste
brings
about
a
burnt
coffeeespresso
flavor
that
i
feel
is
too
blunt
chocolate
mixes
slightly
as
well
as
some
earthy
flavors
this
one
is
too
one
sided
and
intense
to
really
be
enjoyed
not
a
bad
offering
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
dark
horse
here
im
guessing
ill
rate
this
fresh
and
give
it
a
higher
rating
but
for
the
style
and
overall
flavor
profile
at
this
age
its
remarkably
wonderful

o
a
decent
beer
drinkable
wonder
if
this
one
would
be
better
fresh
when
it
gushed
i
feared
it
might
be
infected
but
i
dont
get
that
impression
overall
a
really
nice
rendition
of
something
that
usually
doesnt
work
for
me
i
think
the
smoke
and
the
sweetness
helped
make
this
enjoyable
for
me
i
accidentally
bought
a
second
bottle
of
this
and
now
im
glad
i
did
o
not
a
very
good
beer
the
flavors
clash
in
unpleasant
ways
that
make
it
difficult
to
drink
i
like
the
feel
of
this
beer
which
fit
the
style
greatly
o
nice
i
would
buy
again
but
i
wouldnt
order
a
second
pint
tasty
and
certainly
smoky
quite
sweet
with
dark
malt
notes
and
a
smoky
character
similar
to
a
schlenkerla
brew
but
less
intense
as
a
lager
its
similar
to
dark
lagers
from
the
baltic
region
though
i
dont
reckon
any
of
those
involved
bamburg
malt
a
solid
effort
the
only
weakness
is
the
slightly
subpar
mouthfeel
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
overall
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
i
get
for
aging
this
one
a
little
but
it
is
only
ok
i
am
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
one
again
with
the
intent
to
age
i
need
to
seek
this
one
out
fresh

but
not

smoked
porter
this
was
absolutely
wonderful
a
real
treat
i
hope
to
find
this
one
again
o
this
is
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
but
the
smoke
could
have
been
stronger
though
great
divides
smoked
baltic
porter
is
quite
drinkable
but
i
would
prefer
it
with
a
whole
lot
more
smoke
and
intensity
these
guys
make
some
fantastic
beers
but
this
one
is
fairly
mediocre
d
very
drinkable
nice
smokey
porter
with
a
nice
overall
balance
of
flavors
good
body
and
mouthfeel
good
baltic
porter
with
a
bit
of
smoke
hmmm
i
like
smoked
beers
and
i
like
baltic
porters
but
this
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
although
an
enjoyable
beer
from
a
great
brewery
smoked
baltic
porter
left
me
somewhat
disappointed
in
that
it
had
neither
the
thick
complex
flavor
of
a
great
baltic
porter
nor
the
meaty
smokey
flavors
i
had
hoped
for
on
reading
the
label
bottled
on
august

2010
served
from
bottle
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
brown
with
a
half
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
smoke
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
smoke
roasted
malt
subtle
dark
chocolate
and
cream
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
the
smokiness
on
this
one
really
made
this
brew
stand
out
from
other
baltic
porters
i
have
tasted
in
the
past
this
added
a
nice
complex
but
definitely
covered
up
a
lot
of
the
nice
flavors
that
makes
the
baltic
porter
great
to
me
still
a
fairly
well
done
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
in
the
future
o
disappointed
this
beer
is
exceedingly
drinkable
but
not
at
all
complex
the
beer
poured
a
very
dark
shade
of
brown
with
a
beige
colored
two
finger
thick
head
the
smell
was
that
of
cocoa
coffee
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
but
sadly
there
was
not
much
smoke
smell
the
taste
confirmed
that
the
smoked
malt
was
all
but
drowned
by
the
very
good
baltic
porter
flavors
of
chocolate
toffee
and
roasted
grains
there
was
a
creamy
finish
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
some
lactic
acid
sourness
and
the
aftertaste
was
somewhat
spicy
as
nice
as
it
was
i
kept
wondering
where
is
the
smoke
overall
this
is
a
solid
baltic
porter
if
that
is
your
style
i
prefer
american
porters
myself
but
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
thats
just
because
i
can
get
an
american
for
the
same
price
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
certainly
much
better
as
it
warms
o
not
a
truly
great
beer
but
an
incredibly
wellcrafted
one
a
creamysmooth
sweetishdry
baltic
porter
highly
recommended
will
definitely
buy
another
one
if
i
see
it
overall
im
not
wild
about
this
one
lacks
complexity
just
not
that
enjoyable
its
my
first
baltic
porter
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
id
pass
on
this
again
i
would
actually
like
to
see
this
beer
done
with
more
traditional
lagering
practices
and
to
develop
the
aged
fruit
and
sherry
notes
that
would
smoothen
the
rougher
edges
of
smoke
and
char
overall
pretty
nice
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
coloring
with
hazelnut
highlights
and
a
crystal
clear
look
when
held
up
to
the
light
there
is
a
nice
fluffy
light
offwhite
head
on
the
pour
of
about
a
half
an
inch
but
that
settles
fairly
quickly
out
into
a
sparse
covering
of
foam
the
aromas
are
rich
and
smooth
with
a
good
smokey
presence
some
char
and
dark
roasted
coffee
meaty
characteristics
and
some
dark
chocolate
highlights
flavors
are
smooth
and
subtle
with
some
slick
chocolate
notes
throughout
the
dry
body
gives
a
sharpness
to
the
smoke
and
char
characteristics
on
the
palate
there
are
also
some
very
dark
sweet
fruit
notes
in
the
backbone
with
some
currant
and
plum
present
the
aftertaste
is
fairly
nondescript
with
some
of
the
fruit
and
chocolate
hinting
around
the
finish
is
slick
and
quick
with
a
slight
drying
feel
to
it
decent
brew
and
light
enough
in
body
to
drink
in
quantity
would
match
up
well
with
a
hearty
rich
meaty
meal
overall
very
goodtasting
brew
and
quite
interesting
to
think
about
while
tasting
beer
drinks
much
easier
than
anticipated
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
smoked
beer
this
may
not
be
for
you
however
this
is
a
very
well
done
porter
that
has
some
really
good
flavor
deep
dark
porter
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
light
lacing
very
muted
nose
disappointingly
so
with
roast
and
not
much
else
comic
out
some
licorice
and
light
smoke
along
with
roast
in
the
body
mild
lacing
a
nice
and
subtle
beer
that
imo
was
hurt
by
sampling
a
stellar
porter
right
before
it
153rd
a
very
inviting
beer
the
smoke
is
strong
but
its
more
of
a
dry
smoke
and
not
a
meat
smoke
flavor
nice
smoked
fruit
in
the
aroma
would
be
good
to
split
the
bomber
w
someone
mouthfeel
is
okay
i
might
be
way
off
base
but
i
felt
it
was
a
tad
undercarbonated
a
balanced
beer
i
cant
decide
if
its
balanced
because
all
the
facets
are
mediocre
or
because
they
did
a
nice
job
putting
the
beer
together
dr
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
might
have
it
again
well
executed
for
the
style
but
not
without
its
flaws
drinkability
typically
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
they
are
more
to
my
wifes
taste
however
this
one
was
a
good
mixed
of
smoke
and
roastiness
that
complemented
the
style
well
could
stand
to
have
another
i
received
a
bottle
as
a
gift
and
im
certainly
heading
for
this
during
my
next
trip
to
the
good
beer
store
weird
beer
this
nothing
about
it
is
bad
nothing
is
ungood
actually
but
the
best
part
is
just
a
wee
little
wisp
which
frustrates
me
light
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
porter
with
a
nice
amount
smoke
and
little
alcohol
taste
overall
a
drinkable
porter
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
a
fantastic
porter
with
just
a
slight
touch
of
smoke
actually
more
in
the
aroma
than
the
taste
well
balanced
a
rewarding
porter
experience
cost
6
99
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
everything
is
kind
of
on
the
moderate
side
nothings
too
big
its
not
a
smokebomb
etc
maybe
not
super
exciting
but
well
made
and
well
balanced
and
drinkable
went
very
well
with
pastrami
on
marble
rye
overall
another
good
beer
from
great
divide
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
overall
a
good
version
of
this
style
but
i
would
prefer
the
smoke
to
not
be
as
strong
from
the
650
ml
foiled
capped
bottle
sampled
on
november
25
2011
the
pour
is
dark
brown
to
black
with
brownish
hues
in
the
light
some
clarity
and
a
small
head
the
aroma
has
an
anticpated
smoky
malt
sensation
but
there
is
something
else
that
i
cannot
quite
define
it
may
be
the
yeast
but
it
makes
me
think
of
olive
oil
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
the
taste
is
far
superior
to
the
aroma
with
a
solid
smoky
maltiness
and
a
lightly
balance
hop
finish
not
bitter
but
not
sweet
somewhere
in
between
this
was
a
likeable
drinkable
beer
o
hmmm
smoked
baltic
porter
a
little
of
the
sweet
side
but
the
smokiness
balances
out
nicely
great
divide
never
disappoints
o
a
style
thats
fairly
new
to
me
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
strange
to
think
of
a
porter
as
a
lager
but
thats
what
this
is
and
it
works
very
well
indeed
one
more
instance
of
how
beer
can
be
the
worlds
most
interesting
and
varied
beverage
taste
actually
shows
a
bit
more
sweetness
than
i
anticipated
and
helps
firm
up
the
body
a
bit
smoke
is
there
a
little
bit
but
as
a
smokehead
i
am
disappointed
more
smoke
dammit
malts
have
a
fairly
pleasant
feel
to
them
and
are
really
neither
overly
roasty
nor
chocolaty
more
of
a
honeycharred
biscuit
flavor
its
not
too
shabby
but
its
one
of
those
beers
where
1
bomber
to
try
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
if
it
was
in
sixers
for
8
or
9
bucks
yea
i
would
probably
go
there
again
especially
as
a
fan
of
the
smoked
porter
style
sometimes
i
dislike
the
bomber
format
this
beer
is
a
prime
example
21
bucks
a
sixer
equivalent
no
thanks
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
it
is
very
drinkable
that
said
it
subtly
showcases
the
flavors
that
are
so
boldly
printed
on
the
label
i
like
this
fact
but
you
may
be
disappointed
if
you
are
looking
for
these
flavors
to
dominate
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
im
not
going
to
toss
it
by
any
means
happy
halloween
prepping
for
a
cold
night
of
trick
or
treating
with
the
kids
so
i
am
starting
with
the
great
divide
smoked
baltic
porter
it
poured
a
deep
rich
dark
opaque
the
ecru
head
was
nices
and
laced
the
smell
included
smoke
and
earthpeat
the
taste
had
mostly
earth
and
peat
with
only
subtle
hints
of
smoke
the
mouthfeel
was
good
decent
carbonation
and
balance
between
flavor
and
abv
content
the
body
was
medium
so
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
overall
it
was
quite
a
good
beer
and
certainly
congratulate
gd
on
it
edit
this
does
really
well
with
some
age
i
just
had
a
bottle
maybe
five
years
old
and
it
holds
up
incredibly
well
meaty
and
refined
i
really
like
its
mature
status
smoke
might
not
be
the
first
thing
that
greets
my
buds
but
its
darn
near
close
a
measured
sweetness
rushes
the
door
too
hops
remain
mostly
out
of
the
way
the
lingering
effect
is
somewhat
strange
i
struggle
to
discern
if
it
is
an
effect
of
the
smoke
or
if
the
malt
bill
or
hops
or
whatever
produce
almost
a
cola
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
overall
i
wavered
in
a
couple
of
these
ratings
so
it
probably
is
a
complete
rating
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
somewhat
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
is
alright
but
i
didnt
find
a
ton
of
depth
in
the
flavor
and
i
tend
to
go
for
a
legit
rauchbier
if
i
want
something
smoked
great
divide
smoked
baltic
porter
is
a
dark
brownblack
ale
with
a
caramel
brown
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
just
smoke
its
a
dark
smell
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
peat
medium
bodied
it
seems
a
little
flat
at
the
beginning
but
theres
sharp
carbonation
at
the
finish
which
is
a
little
watery
and
silty
dark
caramel
malt
burnt
sugar
and
smoke
give
it
a
sort
of
dusty
flavor
with
a
warm
almost
sweet
center
it
leaves
a
sort
of
burnt
cardboard
flavor
in
my
mouth
which
makes
me
thirsty
there
are
notes
of
black
currant
leather
hay
and
grass
yeah
this
is
a
pretty
manly
beer
twentytwo
ounces
will
grow
your
stubble
at
least
a
millimeter
if
it
were
any
any
smokier
itd
be
out
of
control
but
it
ends
up
tasting
like
iron
leather
dark
wood
and
smoldering
embers
seriously
this
is
certainly
a
smoky
beer
in
fact
the
smoke
is
so
dominant
it
almost
makes
it
truly
a
smoked
beer
first
and
a
baltic
porter
a
very
distant
second
i
actually
genuinely
love
the
smoke
character
but
i
appreciate
the
style
on
which
it
is
based
as
well
tasteroast
coffee
woodsmoke
bamberg
smoked
malt
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
tasty
and
tingly
with
a
very
dry
black
coffee
finish
a
nice
match
for
grilled
meats
overall
has
a
great
body
with
good
malt
tones
the
smoke
flavor
is
just
enough
to
balance
this
brew
out
a
great
beer
to
have
with
cheeses
cheers
o
not
bad
solid
example
of
the
style
id
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
most
rauchbiers
just
always
have
a
hard
time
getting
past
that
pork
aftertaste
if
it
were
more
char
and
less

the

it

seem
to
lack
a
little
bit
in
the
richness
department
which
would
help
the
bit
smoke

but
the
quaffability
more
than
makes
up
for
this
this
is
quite
nice
and
i
definitely
wouldnt

spending
a
long
session
with
a
couple
22oz

of
this
brew
somehow
despite
my
liking
the
quaffability
of
this
beer
the
body
can
seem

thin
at
times
but
i
seriously
think
this
might
just
be
my
palate
at
the
moment
overall
quite
a
tasty
porter
the
palate
could
be
a
little
bigger
for
the
style
but
for
a
lighter
version
of
a
baltic
porter
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
one
id
gladly
pick
up
again
if
i
saw
it
another
good
one
from
great
divide
recommended
pours
a
black
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
oatmeal
slight
smoke
and
slight
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
a
baltic
porter
barely
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
only
the
slightest
acidity
noticeable
tastes
of
sweet
malt
oatmeal
slight
alcohol
slight
smoke
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
acidity
overall
the
sweetness
is
strongly
present
the
smoke
is
more
subtle
but
there
its
the
acidity
that
is
lacking
especially
for
a
baltic
porter
d
very
easy
drinking
the
light
smokiness
on
the
finish
and
the
clean
dark
chocolate
flavors
that
imparted
a
slight
bitter
chocolate
note
made
this
quite
enjoyable
kept
the
glass
and
had
the
beer
for
roughly
7
at
a
barrestaurant
and
i
believe
the

a
nice
treat
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
solid
porter
with
a
nice
twist
with
the
smoked
malts
d
not
outstanding
but
not
offensive
and
a
solid
baltic
porter
d
pretty
high
for
a
smoked
beer
i
might
suggest
this
to
those
who
arent
big
on
inyourface
smoked
beers
as
it
was
a
gift
i
cant
comment
on
the
value
but
with
great
divide
im
sure
its
worth
the
price
competent
smoked
porter
smoke
and
roast
aromas
nothing
a
coffee
drinker
would
not
experience
black
as
night
with
foamy
offwhite

mouthfeel
is
slick
oily
average
oevrall
actually
expecting
something
thicker
roast
is
balanced
nothing
too
complex
here
very
decent
drinkability
conclusion
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
is
quite
tasty
if
i
brewed
it
i
would
be
pleased
but
not
joyful
take
out
the
phenolic
flavors
and
replace
them
with
toasty
malts
and
this
would
soar
in
my
opinion
d
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
or
try
to
obtain
in
any
fashion
not
a
bad
beer
but
many
other
things
i
would
rather
drink
d
fairly
drinkable
nothing
exciting
yet
enjoyable
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
because
i
typically
love
gd
stuff
the
beer
though
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
pours
dark
with
little
head
nose
is
of
simple
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
smoke
to
it
the
smoke
isnt
ashy
which
is
a
good
thing
because
bad
smoked
beers
often
taste
ashy
to
me
and
its
just
gross
taste
is
ok
a
mild
porter
with
pretty
mild
smoke
to
it
nothing
too
special
mf
is
a
bit
light
which
makes
for
some
easier
drinking
but
also
combines
with
other
underwhelming
factors
to
make
this
beer
a
bit
runofthemill
it
goes
down
easily
because
its
thin
and
has
no
strong
flavors
great
divide
has
a
miss
here
only
made
worse
by
the
fact
that
they
call
it
smoked
st
bridgets
was
a
much
better
beer
why
not
bring
that
recipe
back
or
just
add
smoked
malt
to
that
recipe
and
bring
it
back
future
outlook
a
bit
thin
and
uninspired
not
terrible
but
not
worth
bothering
with
again
d
mild
enough
but
good
enough
to
have
a
few
of
notes
i
expected
much
more
from
this
beer
the
nose
was
very
promising
but
the
complexity
was
just
not
there
in
the
taste
all
other
aspects
of
the
beer
are
average
at
best
d
the
smoke
is
very
subtle
but
a
nice
addition
it
works
well
this
way
but
i
would
be
interested
to
try
it
with
more
smoke
to
it
the
flavor
is
very
smooth

overall
i

again
in

however
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
because
it
wasnt
quite
smoky
enough
for
me
d
very
enjoyable
this
beer
balanced
its
rich
sugary
malt
profile
perfectly
with
the
smoked

character
the
smoke
is
strong
enough
to
leave
no
question
that
it
is
the
major
focus
of
the
beer
but
it
never
becomes
overwhelming
or
excessively
bacon
like
this
is
a
really

d

not

while
i
certainly
wont
go
out

my

to
get
this
one
again
i
guess
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
the
style
applied
by
the
brewery
doesnt
fit
it
and
i
would
rather
they
called
it
something
else
so
i
wouldnt
have
gotten
my
hopes
up
and
it
may
have
actually
helped
its
scores
however
its
not
too
heavy
and
the
flavors
arent
bad
and
the
abv
is
actually
quite

its

the

ever
poured
down

it
was

and
lacked

i
must
be

a

mouthfeel
is
full
and
fizzy
still
a
great
beer
just
a
little
different
than
expected
overall
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
porter
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
little
lackluster
for
a
brewery
that
makes
some
real
good
beers
o
this
excellent
baltic
porter
is
rich
and
malty
with
ample
notes
of
roasted
grains
and
dark
fruits
this
beer
is
nicely
crafted
with
enough
complexity
and
depth
to
maintain
interest
even
if
used
as
a
session
beer
overall
nice
bit
lacking
on
the

and

bit
otherwise
nice
malts
and
light

drinkable
and
tasty
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
quite
enjoyed
sipping
my
way
through
this
one
and
will
be
happy
to
have
it
again
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
an
interesting
wellmade
beer
that
is
well
worth
sampling
and
having
once
in
a
while
it
also
demonstrates
quite
nicely
what
a
fuzzy
boundary
separates
related
styles
from
each
other
in
some
ways
this
reminds
of
a
porter
and
of
a
baltic
porter
and
in
some
ways
it
reminds
of
an
imperial
stout
this
was
better
than
average
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
darker
brew
i
would
give
it
another
go
it
got
better
as
time
went
by
overall
kind
of
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
hebrew
8
since
its
a
very
roasty
balanced
porter
in
the
same
boat
too
since
its
no
where
to
be
found
around
me
but
worth
buying
again
if
i
got
it
from
halftime
beverage
good
porter
o
i
find
this
baltic
porter
to
be
underwhelming
and
a
tad
watery
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
not
at
all
harsh
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
it
isnt
terrible
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
on
purpose
overall
i
know
the
brewmaster
at
southampton
has
a
habit
of
exploring
the
historical
roots
of
beers
it
appears
that
this
is
the
result
of
such
an
experiment
it
falls
somewhere
between
foreign
extra
stout
and
strong
dark
lager
which
is
what
these
beers
most
likely
tasted
like
back
in
the
day
as
opposed
to
today
where
baltic
porter
has
become
synonymous
with
imperial
stout
o
southamptons
stabs
at
these
core
beers
are
generally
wellcrafted
and
occasionally
outstanding
see
double
white
and
this
one
falls
in
the
wellcraft
and
very
good
camp
will
be
a
good
call
for
those
that
like
a
sweet
note
to
their
porter
overall
not
quite
the
baltic
id
want
but
not
a
substandard
beer
worth
trying
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lush
its
mediumfull
bodied
it
has
a
delicate
yet
restrained
carbonation
that
leaves
a
clean
finishflavor
on
the
palate
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
restrained
definitely
compared
to
other
verions
but
that
is
acceptable
considering
the
lower
abv
level
in
the
category

the

alone
notes
has
a
very

feel
to
it

see

willing
to
offer
something
like
this
rather

the
typical

a
good
solid
beer
that
drinks
very
well
d
this
was
very
nice
and
tasty
with
good
balance
and
nice
body
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
also
so
it
was

this
was

of
the

ive
tried

was

a
try
for
anyone
who
likes
porters
that
are
less
sweet
than
average
with
a
smokey
quality
pours
a
very
dark
brown
but
not
quite
black
thin
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
freshly
ground
espresso
beans
taste
is
some
vinous
wine
qualities
up
front
with
a
pumpernickel
bread
middle
and
a
woody
earthy
hop
finish
finishes
quite
clean
for
a
higher
alcohol
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thin
good
carbonation
good
drinkability
a
nice
baltic
porter
that
i
would
get
again
a
good
example
of
a
baltic
porter
not
to
the
elite
level
of
the
style
but
has
some
good
qualities
had
a
bottle
after
work
has
a
really
smooth
almost
velvety
feel
on
the
front
end
a
snap
of
carbonation
in
the
middle
and
ends
with
a
bit
of
burn
from
the
booze
i
got
a
strong
taste
of
fruit
maybe
white
grape
in
the
front
end
and
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
end
overall
a
solid
beer
syrupy
palate
upfront
along
with
some
roasted
dark
fruits
the
middle
has
the
bubbly
pop
of
carbonation
then
some
dark
cheap
coffee
and
dark
chocoalte
mix
the
finish
is
velvety
on
the
tongue
with
a
chocolate
finish
and
alcohol
linger
overall
not
a
bad
baltic
porter
it
was
really
smokey
but
it
worked
with
this
beer
decent
drinkability
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
brownblack
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
malty
roasty
aroma
with
maybe
a
touch
of
licorice
medium
mouthfeel
sweet
dark
roast
type
flavor
without
the
bitterness
of
some
dark
beers
fairly
sweet
as
well
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
slight
smoke
notes
ends
pretty
dryly
and
cleanly
nice
lace
left
on
the
glass
really
nice
toffeecaramel
flavors
no
real
alcohol
flavors
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
overhypes
itself
as
it
is
not
an
imperial
and
not
really
that
much
of
a
baltic
porter
putting
delusions
of
grandeur
aside
this
hits
the
mark
as
a
quite
good
porter
in
the
american
style
what
once
was
called
the
robust
porter
category
pours
a
tarry
black
with
a
carameltinged
moderate
head
big
roasted
flavors
with
distinct
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
notes
creamy
mouthfeel
and
firm
hopping
bat
cleanup
does
not
push
into
the
harder
roasted
malt
notes
common
to
the
baltic
porter
which
is
okay
here
nicely
done
d
not
all
that
drinkable
due
to
the
lack
of
complexity
and
heavy
body
d
a
solid
baltic
porter
probably
not
something
im
going
to
actively
seek
out
again
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
nonetheless
drinkability
hmm
well
its
a
little
bit
lighter
and
looser
than
i
had
anticipated
still
it
makes
for
a
pleasant
smooth
drink
d
this
is
a
nice
baltic
that
drinks
lighter
than
its
abv
it
was
a
good
accompaniment
to
the
cold
and
rainy
night
i
drank
it
on
3rd
one
of
the
six
pack
none
have
impressed
me
although
this
may
have
been
the
weakest
bottle
4th
5th
were
better
inconsistent
would
be
a
fitting
word
to
use
baltic
porters
are
my
favorite
style
and
this
is
a
pretty
weak
example
overall
nothing
baltic
or
imperial
about
it
d
this
would
probably
work
well
with
a
meal
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
pallet
cleansing
brew
you
coup
also
drink
this
while
playing
cards
or
such
however
i
would
not
drink
this
as
a
kickback
brew
or
at
a
party
or
such
feel
and
drinkability
body
is
much
thinner
than
i
expected
it
to
be
kinda
disappointed
here
it
goes
down
way
to
easy
is
is
much
too
light
it
needs
some
weight
to
it
the
carbonation
is
light
a
fine
delicate
and
it
works
to
bring
out
acidity
slight
tartness
and
the
implication
of
cherries
followed
by
this
is
the
sour
mash
thing
then
in
the
finish
that
alcohol
deal
astringency
from
alcohol
i
like
how
the
carbonation
works
here
very
nice
however
i
really
think
that
the
body
could
use
some
weight
to
it
it
seems
to
just
be
to
thin
i
want
a
full
bodied
porter
especially
if
on
the
back
of
the
label
its
talking
about
deathly
cold
winters
i
want
something
thick
and
heavy
its
easy
to
drink
and
i
find
that
to
be
a
problem
it
goes
down
to
smooth
body
is
too
light
and
id
prefer
to
sip
on
it
but
the
body
doesnt
warrent
that
sure
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
it
but
im
not
sure
that
id
go
looking
for
this
one
give
it
a
go
im
glad
i
did
but
ive
had
better
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
still
really
quite
boring
honestly
i
have
not
been
that
impressed
with
southampton
but
i
only
get
their
major
produce
the
taste
is
definite
caramels
toffee
there
is
a
woody
or
oaken
character
to
this
beer
there
is
plenty
of
sweetish
dark
malts
crystal
malts
as
well
almost
a
slight
nutty
flavor
emerges
there
isnt
the
tough
boozy
or
chewy
quality
that
you
find
with
other
bps
the
body
is
much
more
medium
bodied
than
is
typical
for
the
style
there
is
less
assertiveness
here
less
creaminess
just
a
lighter
and
sweeter
beer
than
many
other
bps
there
is
no
boozy
quality
and
the
7
or
so
abv
is
well
hidden
this
beer
isnt
particularly
warming
it
is
a
sweet
porter
that
is
plenty
drinkable
but
not
brilliant
d
a
pretty
good
drinker
for
a
7
2
brew
id
have
it
again
t
its
extremely
smooth
with
an
intense
barley
malt
taste
to
it
like
the
smell
there
is
some
chocolate
in
there
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
porters
that
ive
had
thin
and
syrupy
no
backbone
no
body
little
taste
when
i
think
imperial
porter
i
think
gonezo
which
they
had
but
since
i
can
drink
it
in
california
i
ignored
this
was
a
big
disappointment
d
nice
brew
that
was
quite
enjoyable
well
this
is
my
first
commercial
sampling
of
this
style
i
know
it
tends
to
be
clean
often
brewed
with
a
lager
yeast
and
much
less
aggressive
in
terms
of
roasted
malts
but
this
is
even
smoother
than
expected
all
in
all
pretty
good
although
i
think
i
prefer
something
a
bit
more
aggressive
pours
with
a
quickly
reducing
one
finger
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
deep
brown
but
not
quite
black
smell
is
chocolate
maybe
licorice
and
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
the
same
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
others
ive
had
but
all
in
all
true
to
the
style
less
expensive
than
others
and
a
good
solid
brew
southampton
brews
a
wide
variety
of
styles
only
a
few
available
here
but
great
offerings
none
the
less
bomber
dark
as
night
color
and
viscous
great
roasted
aromas
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
great
coffee
and
mocha
flavors
compared
to
baltic
thunder
i
would
say
this
one
has
more
body
nothing
age
worthy
in
my
book
but
then
again
i
dont
look
to
age
these
great
baltic
would
have
again
if
it
were
around
d
this
is
a
really
good
porter
lots
of
dark
mixed
flavors
in
there
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
will
seek
this
out
again
d
not
a
terribly
drinkable
beer
but
rather
average
also
not
terribly
complex
im
not
too
impressed
here
the
body
does
add
a
bit
to
the
score
but
its
not
something
that
can
really
make
up
for
the
lack
of
flavor
in
the
taste
and
lack
of
appearance
in
what
is
claimed
to
be
an
imperial
porter
overall
a
very
very
good
offering
for
southampton
this
has
to
be
the
best
imperial
porter
ive
ever
had
hands
down
far
and
away
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
this
is
tasty
stuff
and
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
of
it
this
bomber
was
way
way
to
easy
to
polish
off
overall
im
not
really
so
impressed
there
are
definitely
better
porters
out
there
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
average
aroma
emanating
from
this
one
some
roasty
malt
and
some
coffee
creamer
light
in
body
silky
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
great
mouthfeel
even
though
some
may
say
its
a
little
thin
i
remember
this
beer
in
years
past
22oz
bottles
being
a
bit
bolder
and
bigger
in
body
and
flavor
oh
well
dark
malt
dominates
the
flavor
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
i
wouldnt
quite
call
a
true
hop
character
in
this
one
my
only
complaint
is
the
yeast
chosen
it
tastes
like
a
macro
lager
strain
one
of
the
better
samples
ive
had
since
the
southampton
fiasco
and
the
first
ive
had
out
of
latrobe
under
the
sh
label
light
mouthfeel
for
a
porter
would
hesitate
to
say
watery
but
definitely
light
in
terms
of
expectations
of
a
baltic
porter
bottle
says
southampton
is
a
brewer
of
a
full
range
of
classic
ales
and
lagers
i
would
say
this
is
probably
holding
to
the
classic
style
just
not
as
tasty
as
some
of
the
other
baltic
porters
i
have
had
great
to
drink
could
be
a
bit
bigger
in
body
but
great
flavor
character
and
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
a
light
black
color
dark
garnet
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
two
finger
tan
creamy
head
with
good
retention
leaving
thick
lacing
that
slides
back
to
the
beer
sweet
aromas
of
caramel
butterscotch
and
stone
fruit
up
front
flavors
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
to
balance
alcohol
warmth
in
the
middle
with
a
milk
chocolate
finish
low
carbonation
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
porter
not
too
much
of
anything
d
not
a
favorite
of
mine
it
just
dont
come
together
a
touch
of
sweetness
may
have
helped
to
bring
the
flavors
together
i
am
generally
a
fan
of
porters
but
had
not
tried
this
one
from
a
familiar
name
in
craft
brews
i
was
not
disappointed
decent
head
from
the
pour
though
not
voluminous
similarly
there
was
lots
of
malt
in
the
nose
though
not
a
complex
aroma
the
payoff
however
was
in
the
taste
a
rich
full
sample
of
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
very
much
in
line
with
the
porter
style
there
was
not
a
lot
of
hops
but
there
was
clearly
a
hopsy
bitterness
to
the
aftertaste
as
they
say
its
in
dere
even
though
the
style
of
this
brew
is
much
more
in
the
british
mold
of
lots
of
malt

this
beer
has
been
excellently
review
many
times
so
ill
keep
it
short
it
appeals
to
the
eyes
with
its
deep
very
dark
chestnut
and
small
but
lingering
tan
head
it
has
the
familiar
baltic
porter
smell
with
complex
malts
taking
center
stage
the
taste
is
quite
large
up
front
more
of
the
aforementioned
malts
bringing
thick
chocolate
flavors
to
the
front
of
the
palate
and
staying
smooth
throughout
the
alcohol
warmth
adds
to
the
superb
finish
in
my
opinion
the
high
point
of
this
fine
beer
full
body
and
a
smooth
texture
that
refuses
to
let
go
of
the
cheeks
this
is
a
real
treat
one
im
surprised
i
like
considering
the
price
and
how
cheap
i
am
but
this
is
a
real
find

seeking
out
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cleanclear
blackish
color
not
much
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
tannish
head
which
disappears
quickly
there
was
some
slight
oil
slicks
no
lacing
the
nose
is
very
nice
though
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
tons
of
toffeecoffeecaramel
the
taste
is
excellent
mix
of
roastedsweet
malts
and
toffeecoffeecaramel
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
warming
effect
going
on
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
southampton
brew
i
have
a
couple
of
others
hopefully
will
get
more
in
trades
i
like
thisi
think
it
may
take
some
getting
used
to
for
me
this
is
a
strong
beer
and
a
very
overpowering
taste
overall
a
very
nice
and
robust
porter
very
drinkable
dit
is
very
tasty
i
like
it
a
lot
i
would
buy
it
if
i
saw
it
d
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
smooth
and
drinkable
southampton
has
it
goin
on
once
again
poured
a
pretty
solid
black
color
with
no
head
and
zero
lacing
to
speak
of
hopefully
it
was
a
bad
pour
aromas
of
chocolate
and
a
sour
sweet
quality
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
sharp
and
oily
in
the
mouth
there
were
flavors
of
burnt
chocolate
and
charcoal
some
mild
coffee
notes
and
a
sweet
fruitiness
that
followed
by
the
alcohol
presence
not
really
on
par
with
most
of
the
other
southampton
brews
in
my
opinion
there
is
a
very
dry
sharp
dark
chocolate
flavor
that
is
complimented
by
the
taste
of
nuts
charcoal
and
slightly
bitter
hops
that
never
overstate
their
importance
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
creamy
this
was
my
first
baltic
porter
and
i
came
away
impressed
id
have
this
one
again
drinkability
fine
many
thanks
to
a
great
ba
zrbrrt
for
this
brew
for
my
ba
annv
serve
it
well
chilled
and
your
friends
will
love
it
i
expected
better
from
you
southampton
d
one
of
favorite
baltic
porters
very
tasty
poured
from
a
southampton
bomber
into
a
hotel
room
glass
dark
brownblack
color
with
thin
tan
foam
that
lasted
2
seconds
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
just
about
perfect
for
the
style
sweet
and
malty
with
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
competes
well
with
benchmarks
like
okocim
really
nicely
done
bomber
that
had
been
aged
about
6
months
in
the
cellar
poured
into
a
red
wine
glass
pour
yielded
an
oily
black
liquid
with
minimal
head
low
head
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
was
very
sweet
with
hints
of
licorice
coffee
and
prunes
taste
was
very
much
dominated
by
the
malt
resulting
in
a
very
sweet
beer
with
not
much
support
from
the
hops
i
would
say
that
the
hops
were
just
enough
to
not
balance
mouthfeel
was
very
oily
and
thick
with
just
enough
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
was
the
highlight
of
this
beer
i
split
this
bomber
with
another
beer
advocate
but
i
probably
would
not
have
had
any
problem
finishing
the
whole
thing
myself
a
decent
beer
smooth
and
very
drinkable
easy
to
finish
a
22oz
but
not
my
favorite
porter
by
far
after
eating
a
brownie
i
decide
to
sip
this
one
a
rich
chocolate
flavor
arrives
along
with
some
burnt
roasted
malts
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
heath
bar
without
the
fun
crunch
the
swallow
is
smooth
while
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
it
doesnt
take
over
and
permeate
my
senses
maybe
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
this
year
it
is
early
though
07
some
sting
hits
the
tip
of
my
tongue
from
the
alcohol
phenols
but
the
body
is
nice
and
smooth
very
full
and
chewy
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
with
the
alcohol
sticking
around
a
bit
this
is
a
very
drinkable
warming
and
yummy
treat
for
the
winter
season
the
only
knock
on
it
is
that
after
finishing
a
bottle
or
two
youll
be
on
the
floor
ending
your
fun
drinking
of
this
one
id
definitely
like
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
and
age
it
a
year
or
two
and
see
how
she
breathes
drinkable
yes
but
not
way
it
has
a
bit
to
much
molasses
type
feel
and
flavor
to
be
a
real
drinkable
lad

additional
notes
july
2008
a
bottle
of
this
got
buried
in
the
cellar
consumed
a
year
and
a
half
later
didnt
age
particularly
well
lost
carbonation
and
the
taste
became
heavy
on
black
licorice
without
all
the
other
subtle
nuances
i
liked
originally
so
my
advice
is
to
drink
it
more
or
less
fresh
appearance
was
almost
black
frothy
light
brown
head
that
mostly
vanished
aroma
was
toasted
milk
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
a
little
toofee
as
well
this
was
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
and
not
overpowering
the
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
and
taste
reminded
me
of
some
ris
but
without
the
bite
mighty
enjoyable
and
a
nice
winter
brew
on
this
last
day
of
the
year
pours
a
jet
black
but
with
splashes
of
purple
and
ruby
to
the
light
no
real
head
the
distinct
baltic
aroma
flavours
of
anise
roast
maybe
some
caramel
malt
all
very
subdued
and
mellowed
nicely
not
the
most
complex
ale
but
extremely
enjoyable
greatly
enjoyed
this
time
of
the
year
truly
captured
the
essence
of
the
style
highly
recommended
for
those
who
like
the
style
great
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
if
this
was
available
near
me
id
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
a
must
for
anyone
who
likes
porter
especially
baltics
thanks
again
jan
roasty
malty
sweet
and
while
thin
for
a
bigger
brew
very
easy
to
drink
great
winter
beer
great
for
the
cold
night
style
drink
poured
into
a
glass
at
50
degrees
beer
had
a
wonderful
brown
head
that
really
smelled
great
when
i
shoved
it
in
my
face
this
dark
porter
i
thought
was
really
tasty
with
a
slightly
sweet
taste
almost
like
an
oatmeal
beer
and
it
went
very
well
with
my
thick
tbone
steak
the
only
problem
was
i
only
had
one
i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
anyway
going
in
i
was
expecting
something
with
the
consistency
of
molasses
because
of
the
word
imperial
on
the
label
its
not
like
that
at
all
this
is
much
more
drinkable
and
the
flavor
is
not
as
overpowering
as
it
tends
to
be
in
imperial
stouts
this
example
is
my
first
exposure
to
the
baltic
porter
style
and
i
would
not
say
no
if
offered
more
received
this
a
few
months
ago
from

color
is
just
a
hair
under
midnight
black
with
a
nice
brown
head
nice
warm
aroma
dark
and
malty
but
without
an
overbearing
coffee
smell
someone
else
mentioned
a
woody
aroma
which
works
for
me
too
great
taste
its
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
if
i
want
a
big
baltic
porter
this
isnt
it
but
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
porter
this
bomber
went
down
way
too
fast
d
nothing
imperial
about
this
regardless
this
is
a
nice
and
tasty
brew
just
a
nice
desert
nose
is
a
bit
woody
with
a
notable
bit
of
alcohol
brown
sugar
and
a
whiff
of
chocolate
in
the
mouth
much
less
sweetness
creamy
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
that
gives
way
to
a
rich
but
subdued
flavor
profile
tastes
of
a
bit
of
cream
with
obligatory
caramel
and
powderedchocolate
notes
just
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
balances
the
generally
friendly
taste
well
remarkably
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
thats
the
real
strength
of
this
brew
i
could
hurt
myself
on
this
stuff
sessioning
something
this
strong
would
be
illadvised
d
the
smokiness
intended
or
not
is
an
interest
change
i
think
that
it
takes
away
from
the
ale
a
bit
certainly
a
good
beer
but
not
as
exciting
as
something
like
okocim
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
subtle
flavors
entice
you
to
do
just
that
really
welldone
porter
i
will
purchase
a
few
more
of
these
nice
and
drinkable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
like
the
label
as
well
its
a
bit
plain
but
it
almost
looks
a
bit
regal
with
definite
roasted
aspects
coffee
is
apparent
not
much
light
peeking
through
good
carbonation
but
not
a
lot
of
head
with
faint
chestnut
highlights
it
poured
with
a
thin
smooth
mouthfeel

followed
by
a
whiff
on

malty
sweetness
that
almost
salivates
your
mouth
the
taste
finally
hits
you
with
some
slight
carbonation
and
slight
chocolate
flavor
there
is
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
that
dominates
the
tastebuds
its
different
from
other
porters
the
mf
is
a
little
light
for

a

this

roasted

very

thanks
bytemesis
from
the
other
site
for
the
opportunity
overall
a
very
nice
brew
i
love
the
baltic
porter
style
and
it
can
be
hard
to
come
by
glad
i
had
this
one
this
was
pretty
typical
in
terms
of
the
strength
of
the
booze
but
didnt
pack
a
terribly
strong
punch
there
was
enough
to
like
here
but
nothing
major
stood
out
from
start
to
fnish
a
bit
less
carbonation
and
more
body
would
have
made
this
stand
out
but
as
is
this
was
a
baltic
porter
that
most
people
should
easily
enjoy
once
the
novelties
are
overlooked
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
really
does
remind
me
more
of
a
phenolic
hot
dubbel
than
a
baltic
porter
unfortunately
its
just
a
little
too
hot
and
messy
to
be
great
update

suffering
from
a
sore
throat
and
tonsillitis
i
decided
to
try
a
can
of
the
baltic
porter
instead
of
licorice
root
tea
not
only
did
i
feel
better
but
the
next
day
my
throat
infection
and
pain
was
much
better
now
i
plan
to
keep
a
few
cans
of
this
around
for
medicinal
purposes
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
full
head
tan
in
color
appearance
was
dark
brown
to
black
with
an
aroma
that
held
hints
of
malt
and
spice
taste
was
of
a
pronounced
malt
and
chocolates
with
hints
of
caramel
and
cpice
mouthfeel
was
moderate
with
a
tangy
licorace
aftertaste
pours
black
with
a
giant
cola
head
with
big
bubbles
to
match
that
quickly
dissipate
to
leave
a
brown
actively
fizzy
right
no
lacing
this
carbonation
is
the
number
one
reason
that
i
usually
hate
porters
i
dont
really
have
a
number
two
reason
however
that
is
the
style
so
im
not
sure
what
i
expected
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
you
can
sense
that
there
is
going
to
be
an
alcohol
burn
not
unlike
that
of
a
dark
scotch
aleloch
down
comes
to
mind
subtle
to
medium
hops
toasted
malts
vanilla
maybe
a
little
coffee
or
its
just
a
confusion
of
the
toasty
notes
and
the
vanilla
either
way
quite
nice
taste
goddamnit
bubbles
fuck
off
im
trying
to
taste
this
beer
again
this
is
what
i
hate
about
porters
theyre
good
but
you
have
to
try
to
taste
them
through
a
thick
electric
fence
of
abrasive
carbonation
the
taste
follows
the
nose
exactly
and
its
very
good
i
suspect
i
might
have
scored
this
part
higher
if
i
could
actually
taste
it
more
through
the
assault
of
the
novelty
childrens
drink
this
is
bred
with
maybe
thats
just
me
and
this
is
just
a
porter
for
ya
so
i
dont
think
i
really
even
need
to
address
mouthfeel
at
this
point
i
love
all
beer
just
for
the
sake
of
variety
and
when
i
want
dark
i
typically
stick
to
my
stouts
but
every
once
in
a
while
i
just
have
to
remind
myself
that
porters
arent
my
thing
backtracking
definitely
some
coffee
date
on
the
can
is
912
which
is
usually
the
canned
date
since
it
doesnt
say
best
by
tried
not
long
after
but
cant
help
but
think
its
a
bad
batch
or
can
but
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
have
been
just
as
bad
just
a
heavy
dirt
and
adjunct
alcohol
throughout
o
not
a
huge
or
terribly
complex
baltic
but
nicely
structured
and
welldesigned
the
additives
give
the
aroma
a
little
push
but
arent
noticeably
integral
to
the
success
of
this
one
very
nice
baltic
porter
ill
definitely
grab
up
a
4pack
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
ruddy
brown
amber
with
a
nice
finger
of
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
toasted
mallt
and
a
hint
of
cherry
and
anise
flavor
of
light
fruit
esters
toasted
malt
licorice
and
hint
of
chocolate
and
cherry
finishes
with
an
interesting
wave
of
toasted
malt
and
more
fruit
leaving
a
long
pleasant
and
spicey
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
light
creaminess
not
quite
a
traditional
baltic
porter
but
i
found
the
uncharacteristically
estery
fruit
component
was
very
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
and
spices
pleasant
and
well
done
the
pour
yields
close
to
two
fingers
of
active
foam
plenty
of
larger
bubbles
and
snap
crackle
and
pop
across
the
whole
surface
very
dark
brown
color
given
that
fizziness
not
surprising
head
retention
is
average
at
best
the
liquid
is
equally
dark
and
opaque
stays
more
in
the
brown
than
black
range
this
supported
by
the
orange
aura
around
the
outside
appears
clean
and
unblemished
hard
to
discern
any
bubbles
present
the
nose
loaded
with
roasted
coffee
mocha
and
chocolate
notes
then
moves
from
toast
into
sweeter
caramel
licorice
banana
bread
and
lower
levels
of
peach
apricot
fruit
and
orange
zest
not
that
complex
but
highly
pungent
and
lingering
mediumbodied
creamy
in
texture
with
a
fair
degree
of
booziness
to
it
evokes
something
close
to
vanillin
oak
coconut
and
butterscotch
piles
on
the
roasted
chocolate
coffee
and
the
licorice
a
major
factor
too
almost
minty
at
times
pinch
of
nutmeg
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
and
tends
to
accentuate
that
creaminess
after
awhile
hard
to
really
register
much
past
the
chocolate
element
minimal
cherry
and
peach
fruit
flavors
as
well
as
little
hoppiness
if
you
like
roast
and
can
see
past
the
booziness
its
easy
enough
to
pound
down
the
taste
was
of
a
mild
coffee
and
a
musty
chocolate
combo
followed
by
just
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
to
balance
it
out
it
is
very
clean
and
somewhat
refreshing
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
enjoyable
for
sure
ill
set
a
couple
of
these
down
for
a
year
and
see
what
happens
fortunately
the
beer
has
redeemed
itself
by
the
end
that
nut
character
which
appeared
out
of
nowhere
provided
coherence
and
structure
and
blended
the
flavours
of
the
beer
into
a
sensible
whole
without
it
it
would
be
a
very
different
story
overall
this
is
decent
enough
baltic
porter
then
again
im
a
sucker
for
a
baltic
porter
a
serviceable
baltic
porter
picked
up
fresh
recent
trip
to
pa
pours
a
bit
thick
with
a
bittersweet
chocolate
scent
above
average
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
a
little
bitter
it
could
use
more
a
nice
roasting
nice
drinkability
473
ml
can
provides
a
good
amount
to
be
be
shared
by
two
o
seems
a
little
off
from
the
traditional
baltic
porter
style
more
of
a
combination
of
an
americanenglish
porter
and
a
russian
imperial
stout
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
though
slightly
present
in
the
aroma
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
but
can
be
enjoyed
by
slowly
sipping
also
the
flavors
are
much
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
o
this
beer
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
a
classic
english
porter
given
its
lighter
body
and
lack
of
bitterness
and
a
russian
imperial
stout
with
the
flavors
of
licorice
and
roasted
malts
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
from
the
taste
you
really
need
to
let
his
beer
warm
up
in
order
to
enjoy
its
aromas
and
flavors
o
looks
smells
and
tastes
great
if
it
werent
for
the
mouthfeel
this
would
be
an
excellent
instead
of
a
very
good
beer
the
can
states
that
generous
amounts
of
licorice
and
anise
were
used
in
the
brewing
process
but
i
did
not
get
strong
notes
of
either
this
is
a
minor
criticism
however
as
i
enjoyed
my
first
offering
from
this
brewer
very
much
this
is
a
pretty
decent
baltic
porter
i
know
it
has
about
a
year
on
it
but
the
licorice
is
still
fairly
present
and
an
added
bonus
solid
baltic
porter
on
all
fronts
tasty
lol
a
baltic
porter
in
can
gotta
be
a
first
this
is
a
rare
style
to
see
in
production
and
this
one
certainly
does
it
justice
it
certainly
is
carrying
all
of
the
trademark
characteristics
i
expect
for
the
style
profile
is
smooth
and
consistent
i
like
this
one
a
lot
no
it
doesnt
really
hold
up
perfectly
against
the
many
other
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
but
it
is
definitely
a
well
made
interpretation
not
many
american
brewers
can
really
touch
this
style
from
what
i
have
seen
this
is
an
exception
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
khaki
head
the
nose
is
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
some
mild
licorice
i
get
a
bit
of
coffee
maybe
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
grain
sweetness
light
bitterness
on
the
palate
presumably
from
the
roasted
malt
licorice
burnt
sugar
and
dark
fruits
give
some
sweetness
an
agreeable
oldworld
porter
jazzed
up
with
the
proclaimed
and
indeed
actual
yay
truth
in
advertising
licorice
boost
which
plays
out
in
an
evenhanded
manner
so
much
so
that
i
dont
even
really
notice
it
after
a
while
which
is
another
feather
in
this
offerings
collective
cap
worthy
of
a
try
if
not
more
another
can
offering
and
it
pours
a
dark
jet
kola
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
three
finger
head
that
stays
and
some
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is

and

with

and
overall
its
definately
a
step
up
from
my
last
offering
from
these
guys
and
yeah
i
like
it
as
its
definately
easy
to
drink
to
drink
while
still
having
some
substance
to
it
cheers
reminds
me
of
pop
but
the
booze
hitting
my
head
reminds
me
that
this
is
strong
beer
a
little
over
the
top
with
the
adjuncts
but
a
respectable
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
2
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of

around
the

on
the

smell
is

some

cookie

and
just
a
slight
hint
of
the
licoriceanise
it
was
brewed
with
there
is
a
mild
roasty
and
herbal
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
really
solid
aromas
and
flavors
quite
tasty
and
easy

drink

a
ton
of
licorice
and
roast
notes
of
vanilla
in
the
background
along
with
a
little
bit
of

there
are
earthy
notes
at
the
finish
reminiscent

the
taste
starts
off
with
moderate
sweetness
which
gives
way
to
loads
of
licorice
and
anise
along
with
tobacco
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
a
baltic
porter
with
mild
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
value
a
4
pack
of
pint
cans
for
11
bucks
cant
beat
that
the
beer
doesnt
stand
out
as
being
amazing

it
certainly
offers
some
unique
qualities

drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
a
little
oily
palate
but
thinner
than
i
expected
for
the
style
overall
i
enjoyed
the
taste
of
megadestroyers
big
anise
last
night
but
the
smaller
uncommon
anise
is
very
enjoyable
as
well
im
probably
a
bit
biased
with
both
of
these
though
ive
always
been
an
anise
man
do
a
nice
brew
something
id
love
to
try
on

16oz
can
pours
dark
mahogany
near
black
with
a
ruby
tinge
while
being
poured
and
when
held
to
the
light
thin
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
roasted
malt
smoke
and
faint
anise
the
anise
does
fill
the
nose
more
as
the
ale
warms
tastes
are
complex
with
anise
dominating
the
palate
but
has
roasty
notes
char
smoke
dark
fruit
blueberry
perhaps
dark
chocolate
and
finishes
with
a
sweeter
black
licorice
on
the
back
of
the
palate
reminiscent
of
a
candy
cigar
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
creamy
and
smooth
really
nice
and
full
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
for
its
uniqueness
but
a
whole
pint
of
an
ale
that
is
too
heavy
on
the
anise
gets
to
be
overkill
pretty
quickly
simply
an
amazing
baltic
i
love
stumbling
across
a
brew
that
blows
me
away
in
the
genre
looking
forward
to
other
offerings
of
theirs
sorry
for
lack
of
detail
but
if
you
enjoy
fff
topless
wytch
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
would
seek
this
one
out
and
let
it
warm
for
a
spell
to
appreciate
the
full
flavor
of
this
beer
overall
i
get
the
idea
but
it
loses
a
little
in
the
long
run
great
flavors
but
theyre
muddled
maybe
ill
take
the
cans
advice
and
snag
another
one
and
throw
some
age
on
it
o
an
interesting
take
on
a
baltic
porter
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
well
made
o
we
quite
enjoyed
this
one
big
and
assertive
without
being
extreme
good
times
would
like
to
try
one
a
little
closer
to
the
canned
on
date
to
compare
o
not
exactly
the
licorice
bomb
the
can
says
it
is
but
tasty
nonetheless

bumping

from

0
too
lazy
to
rereview
o
the
alcohol
i
feel
overtakes
any
of
the
complexity
it
a
bit
to
port
wineish
as
a
porter
beer
its
not
bad
but
it
lacks
a
certain
something
uncommon
brewers
baltic
porter
pours
to
fairly
standard
appearance
for
a
porter
the
body
of
the
beer
is
pitch
black
with
maybe
a
finger
and
a
half
of
caramel
foam
sitting
atop
it
head
retention
is
definitely
on
the
short
side
and
lacing
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
milk
chocolate
and
black
licorice
with
the
licorice
probably
standing
out
a
little
bit
more
the
flavor
lets
the
base
beer
shine
through
some
more
as
coffee
joins
the
milk
chocolate
from
the
nose
at
the
same
time
the
licorice
fades
a
bit
more
into
the
background
which
is
just
fine
with
me
the
body
is
nice
and
full
and
chewy
and
carbonation
is
just
a
touch
dull
leading
to
a
decent
mouthfeel
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
about
trying
uncommon
brewers
baltic
porter
once
i
saw
star
anise
and
licorice
mentioned
on
the
can
but
they
manage
to
use
it
to
add
a
nice
subdued
note
to
a
solid
porter
id
definitely
pick
up
some
more
if
it
were
locally
available
canned
on
5142011
and
still
this
carbonated
gawdamn
notes
an
amazing
creamy
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
pick
up
again
cheers
as
a
dissenting
opinion
i
find
this
tough
to
drink
i
admit
its
interesting
and
spicy
and
the
frothy
mouthfeel
is
nice
however
the
bitter
metallic
finish
is
harsh

the

overall
not
a

example
of

style
but
a
bit
dull
and
lacking
any
bold
flavors
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
again
particularly
at
over
4
00
for
a
single
there
are
some
flaws
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
make
this
one
enjoyable
great
use

edit
as
this
warms
faint
traces
of
the
liquorice
flavours
develop
o
my
first
from
uncommon
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
another
the
flavor
is
a
full
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
chewy
from
the
thick
body
and
lots
of
cocoa
predictable
flavoring
of
cocoa
and
mild

the
body
is
neutral
with
an
average
carbonation
m
good
until
the
heat
wave
arrived
after
that
i
was
sold
by
the
peppery
heat
uncommon
indeed
i
wish
that
i
had
a
few
more
cans
lying
around
odoverall
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
first
beer
i
tried
with
this
brewery
this
one
is
much
better
the
feel
stands
out
the
most
to
me
personally
drinkability
is
pretty
high
i
got
a
single
can
of
this
for
about
3
25
which
is
pricey
definitely
worth
a
try
this
may
make
me
try
another
beer
from
this
brewery
split
a
16oz
can
with
a
friend
it
poured
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
i
liked
the
mix
of
roasted
cocoa
barley
and
mild
esters
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
however
gets
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
and
the
fruit
falls
out
with
just
the
roast
left
somethings
off
maybe
a
little
too
much
alcohol
taste
or
maybe
it
hasnt
aged
well
its
close
to
being
a
good
beer
but
isnt
quite
there
overall
very
impressed
actually
wasnt
expecting
much
from
a
brewery
i
have
barely
heard
of
and
from
a
can
but
they
did
the
malts
very
well
without
the
burnt
roasted
flavor
nice
chocolate
black
patent
light
coffee
vanilla
and
caramel
and
light
nutty
light
hops
creamy
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
light
booze
kick
very
nice
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
anise
and
licorice
forward
beers
but
this
one
drinks
fairly
smoothly
and
i
like
it
overall
very
good
youve
got
to
know
a
little
bit
about
this
particular
style
of
beer
to
full
appreciate
it
uncommon
brewers
does
this
one
well
perhaps
well
enough
to
be
the
best
of
their
canned
offerings
so
far
well
done
notes
nice
canned
offering
first
try
from
uncommon
brewers
and
while
maybe
not
the
porter
i
would
that
eagerly
pick
up
again
id
sure
be
glad
some
of
the
rest
of
their
brews
roasty
malts
chicory
ashy
bakers
chocolate
lingering
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malts
lending
an
impression

as

horrendous

there
some
sort
of
trouble
with

or
at
canning
oh
well
heres
another
10
minute
wait
to
taste
the
stuff
ok
after
a
long
thirsty
wait
here
goes
typical
baltic
porter
body
almost
black
yet
with
mahogany
aspects
on
the
edge
actually
a
nice
tightcreamy

head
when
its
under
control
aroma
is
pleasing
fresh
ground
coffee
beancocoa
nibstouch
of
aniseed
a
faint
aroma
of
medicinal
liquorice
very
nice
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
basically
with
a
little
alcoholic
warming
and
some
blackcurrant
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
over
carbonated
for
style
but
ok
and
finally
get
some
strong
liquorice
goodness
over
all
a
nice
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
want
to
buy
anything
else
from
this
brewer
to
drink
with
friends
as
waiting
for
the
froth
monster
to
shrink
isnt
really
my
thing
of
the
uncommons
ive
tried
this
is
less
interesting
but
on
the
whole
it
certainly
has
its
merit
o
not
pasteurizing
this
brew
makes
it
very
nice
and
drinkable
and
adds
a
certain
level
of
raw
freshness
that
helps
the
ingredients
come
through
above
average
for
the
style
and
nice
flavor
additions
i
first
had
uncommon
brewers
baltic
porter
out
of
the
can
while
poolside
on
a
very
hot
sunny
day
and
it
was
terrific
later
i
had
one
poured
into
a
glass
for
the
purposes
of
this
review
and
it
wasnt
quite
as
good
context
means
so
much
this
is
a
great
experience
out
of
the
can
when
aroma
and
appearance
dont
matter
so
much
and
a
pretty
good
baltic
porter
from
a
glass
pours
deep
deep
brown
basically
black
thinnish
tan
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
bounding
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
aromas
very
roasty
and
malty
smooth
dark
chocolate
flavor
with
good
complexity
earthy
roasty
and
malty
fruity
and
quite
sweet
almost
cloying
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
watery
funny
still
getting
used
to
pouring
black
beer
out
of
a
can
a
pretty
good
beer
darkness
fills
the
glass
lacing
drapes
the
top
smells
of
spice
licorice
and
anise
with
suggestions
of
vanilla
and
white
peppercorn
plus
a
bonus
of
melon
fruitiness
creamy
smooth
medium
body
roasty
char
goes
right
to
a
licorice
root
and
anise
that
build
and
then
stick
to
the
palate
dry
charred
graininess
treacle
or
molasses
sweetness
in
the
middle
fruitiness
is
vague
but
rises
up
a
bit
with
the
mild
heat
from
the
alcohol
burnt
finish
is
semidry
a
good
twist
on
a
traditional
style
spice
additions
are
at
a
perfect
level
to
compliment
rather
than
take
over
tallboy
cans
ftw
i
mostly
liked
this
with
the
fruit
roast
hops
and
sweetness
all
coming
together
to
give
this
a
relatively
full
flavored
ripe
and
bitter
feeling
tanginess
the
lightness
of
the
body
does
hurt
this
a
bit
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hid
which
helps
out
in
the
long
run
its
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
its
worth
checking
out
if
you
run
by
a
can
o
pretty
good
im
not
sure
if
id
get
it
again
but
it
was
worth
the
fourpack
the
crack
glug
produced
one
of
the
most
intimidating
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
come
out
of
a
can
it
was
dense
and
black
with
a
finger
of
defiantly
thick
deepbrown
head
that
seemed
impervious
to
humidity
or
anything
it
had
the
best
staying
power
of
any
head
i
can
remember
color
was
a
deep
dark
brownblack
with
only
cola
highlights
at
the
edges
nose
smelled
like
licorice
simply
put
i
was
reminded
of
my
mothers
love
of
twizzlers
nibs
when
i
was
a
kid
but
i
had
to
be
desperate
to
want
to
eat
them
as
black
licorice
was
not
my
bag
as
a
kid
nor
is
it
today
but
in
terms
of
innovation
i
have
to
give
the
brewers
major
props
damn
this
beer
really
made
my
taste
buds
sit
up
and
take
notice
i
really
could
not
get
much
more
than
the
anise
flavor
from
this
beer
but
that
coupled
with
its
thick
mouthfeel
was
enough
the
finish
was
like
i
had
just
chewed
up
a
bag
of
black
licorice
phew
one
was
puhlehntee
but
what
a
one
no
way
is
this
going
into
any
cooler
but
the
one
for
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
feb
annually
when
it
will
help
to
break
the
winter
doldrums
kudos
for
taking
such
a
chance
the
legend
woodychandler
hooked
me
up
with
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
licorice
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
some
anise
and
licorice
coming
through
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
brew
a
return
to
santa
cruz
and
its
uncommon
brewers
has
come
in
reward
with
this
baltic
porter
glad
my
spontaneous
instinct
got
me
into
that
bar
in
the
first
place
if
you
see
it
get
it
its
an
adventure
overall
decent
baltic
porter
though
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
bittering
on
the
end
overall
an
average
style
beer
unsure
on
price
point
as
it
was
a
gift
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
maroon
touch
no
real
haead
a
bit
flat
but
looks
pretty
smells
great
lots
of
dark
fruits
tastes
sweet
and
full
bodied
the
malts
are
very
complex
overall
super
thick
and
rich
for
a
blatic
porter
because
of
that
im
disappointed
in
it
more
of
a
sweetmilk
stout
but
very
tasty
overall
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
this
is
most
likely
my
favorite
baltic
porter
to
date
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
beer
at
7
8
but
i
also
think
it
is
refreshing
enough
to
drink
anytime
a
very
pleasing
drink
this
brewery
always
turns
out
interesting
beers
flavorful
to
say
the
least
whether
or
not
its
to
your
liking
is
another
matter
dwould
be
curious
to
try
it
on
tap
dont
care
for
it
out
of
the
can
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
too
many
off
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
had
around
three
samples
at
the
beer
fest
before
they
ran
out
of
it
notes
to
me
this
beer
is
really
dominated
by
alcohol
presence
which
is
both
good
great
bourbon
and
brandy
qualities
and
bad
very
prevalent
in
the
smell
and
dominant
fusel
alcohols
in
the
finish
definitely
not
my
favorite
though
d
this
is
a
real
nice
beer
from
uncommon
probably
my
favourite
from
them
so
far
just
a
beer
to
enjoy
and
think
about
draught
at
the
red
black
with
a
small
tan
head
sweet
coffee
and
licorice
aroma
full
bodied
with
a
very
silky
texture
and
dark
chocolate
flavor
lots
of
dark
rum
soaked
fruits
coffee
and
a
bitter
finish
very
smooth
rich
and
boozy
in
a
good
way
great
baltic
porter
the
taste
is
similar
its
very
rich
and
strong
and
pungent
restrained
just
before
becoming
truly
intense
with
a
lot
of
rich
complexity
and
very
fullbodied
wellrounded
and
very
wellintegrated
it
has
strong
fermented
caramelized
fruit
dark
dried
figs
prunes
etc
fermented
ginger
bread
with
blackstrap
molasses
and
hints
of
bdark
toast
rum
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
all
interplaying
harmoniously
the
feel
is
rich
oily
and
extremely
silky
and
smooth
with
a
little
liveliness
nevertheless
its
hints
at
its
alcohol
and
one
can
easily
guess
from
the
robustness
etc
that
this
is
pretty
high
but
the
alcohol
itself
is
wellhidden
this
is
a
wonderful
strong
porter
very
rich
and
complex
yet
incredibly
balanced
and
wellintegrated
its
amazingly
easy
to
drink
despite
its
strength
and
robust
flavour
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
pitch
black
with
a
cocoa
colored
head
and
slight
red
hues
with
backing
light
nose
of
roasted
coffee
with
some
cream
and
sugar
some
licorice
and
bourbon
character
as
well
similar
overall
to
coffee
liqueur
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
a
huge
roasted
character
with
moderate
bitterness
and
nice
dryness
very
interesting
and
tasty
a
very
good
beer
and
another
step
in
the
right
direction
for
uncommon
brewers
pours
out
dark
with
an
oily
skin
of
a
head
dried
fruit
aroma
hint
of
molasses
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
fruit
sugar
taste
dissipated
quickly
overall
mouthful
is
slightly
watery
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
cant
say
i
enjoyed
it
too
much
but
it
was
a
dark
porter
that
was
sweet
i
could
definitely
taste
a
perfumey
fruity
sweetness
with
every
sip
its
almost
like
licorice
it
was
a
taste
ive
never
had
before
but
after
a
while
it
started
to
get
to
me
the
unique
flavor
threw
me
off
and
i
was
unsure
if
i
wanted
more
o
the
price
discourages
regular
purchases
but
besides
that
point
this
beer
is
very
good
not
a
mustbuy
since
there
are
cheaper
beers
that
id
argue
do
it
better
but
its
well
worth
a
shot
and
such
a
fantastic
and
reuseable
bottle
wether
this
was
worth
the
big
expense
overall
a
good
beer
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
still
worth
trying
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
pretty
nice
drinkin
here
seems
more
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
than
a
porter
but
whos
counting
o
a
bit
underwhelming
but
the
bottle
makes
up
for
it
o
not
what
you
would
expect
from
a
porter
the
belgian
yeast
makes
for
a
surprising
palate
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
dark
fruits
and
some
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
mouthfeel
needs
improvement
in
my
opinion
review
from
22011
notes
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
red
brown
amber
with
a
vigorous
off
white
head
leaving
nice
lacing
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
mineral
component
tastes
of
light
sweet
malt
and
light
and
dark
fruits
with
belgian
spicing
thin
bodied
and
sweeter
and
lighter
than
most
porters
nice
strong
carbonation
is
refreshing
a
pleasant
belgian
take
on
a
porter
but
not
outstanding
o
overall
not
too
bad
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
baltic
porter
but
its
still
a
good
brew
i
thought
the
bottle
looked
cool
and
the
beer
behind
it
justified
my
purchase
id
still
call
it
a
belgian
dark
ale
instead
of
a
porter
soft
flavors
not
much
of
the
really
dark
roast
and
certainly
none
of
the
charred
malt
we
usually
find
in
porters
and
stouts
the
big
ceramic
bottle
from
mega
liquor
in
hemet
calif
overall
maybe
not
worth
the
price
but
still
a
very
very
very
good
porter
to
try
even
if
you
dont
like
most
porters
are
this
one
is
much
lighter
and
thinner
than
most
porters
you
see
give
it
a
try
even
if
you
like
pale
ales
overall
pretty
average
which
means
not
good
since
the
quality
of
beer
these
days
seems
to
be
quite
good
and
improving
d
not
very
porter
like
but
a
decent
tasting
beer
overall
the
aroma
and
taste
match
up
very
well
without
much
difference
between
the
two
d
very
brown
and
bready
not
really
what
i
think
if
when
i
think
porter
drinkable
but
the
bottle
is
more
attractive
than
the
beer
inside
overall
a
good
beer
but
if
i
didnt
see
this
listed
as
a
baltic
porter
id
just
have
called
it
a
normal
belgian
dark
ale
summary
this
poorter
is
pretty
nice
for
the
price
however
i
would
expect
a
better
brew
personally
i
prefer
fullers
london
porter
which
is
a
little
heavier
i
do
love
the
bottle
though
o
if
you
want
to
lay
down
close
to
10
for
a
very
drinkable
but
quite
average
brew
that
comes
in
a
useful
bottle
if
youre
a
homebrewer
be
my
guest
ill
probably
buy
it
again
but
only
if
its
on
sale
not
bad
o
smelled
quite
nice
and
tasted
pretty
good
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
aroma
is
smoky
and
chocolaty
with
yeast
and
caramel
hints
it
pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
that
is
opaque
save
at
the
edges
and
has
a
very
thick
if
not
persistent
tan
head
the
sample
i
got
fizzed
like
nobodys
business
oh
noes
wasted
beer
satisfying
flavor
is
malty
with
smoky
chocolate
and
nutty
tones
and
just
a
touch
of
caramel
texture
is
quite
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
rather
persistent
tingle
d
easily
drinkable
but
there
are
many
better
options
out
there
the
hoogstraten
poorter
pours
a
dark
brown
a
the
glass
with
a
creamy
white
froth
amazing
aromas
of
black
cherries
black
raspberries
cassis
caramel
belgian
waffle
roasted
nuts
some
baking
spices
and
belgian
yeast
that
follows
through
on
the
palate
the
beer
has
a
medium
light
body
creamy
carbonation
long
finish
there
is
a
definite
sweetness
to
this
beer
however
the
beer
dries
the
palate
on
the
finish
not
bitter
just
dry
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
would
love
to
drink
it
again
but
unfortunately
this
beer
is
way
over
valued
at
10
a
bottle
because
of
the
cost
this
beer
is
not
recommended
unless
you
have
a
ton
of
extra
cash
burning
a
hole
in
your
pocket
overall
this
beer
is
reasonable
to
drink
but
has
several
aspects
that
could
make
it
very
good
not
hard
to
drink
just
not
outstanding
im
not
gonna
lie
i
do
love
beers
that
come
in
these
bottles
there
is
definately
some
love
shown
in
presentation
thats
for
surea
gentle
pour
leaves
a
frothy
creamy
coloured
two
finger
head
with
heaps
of
lacing
and
the
beer
underneath
is
a
very
weird
dark
cherry
colour
with
nice
ruby
highlightsthe
aroma
is
chocolatedried
dark
fruits
and
sugary
malts
with
a
tinge
of
alcoholit
has
a
full
mouthfeel
first
up
followed
by
a
easy
medium
finish
with
nice
tastes
of
raisinsdried
apricots
and
some
strong
yeasty
notes
with
only
a
touch
of
brandy
flavoured
alcohol
present
on
first
couple
of
sipsi
know
this
beer
says
on
the
back
of
the
earthware
bottle
strong
beer
but
to
me
6
5
isnt
what
i
call
strong
beer
and
the
alcohol
isnt
a
major
taste
on
the
palette
so
it
is
amazingly
enough
very
drinkable
for
my
tastes
d
this
tastes
like
no
other
porter
that
ive
had
before
and
thats
not
really
a
good
thing
save
your
money
and
pass
by
this
one
drinkability
entirely
unimpressive
and
not
a
beer
i
could
honestly
recommend
its
one
of
those
beers
that
were
it
not
for
these
notes
i
would
have
absolutely
no
memory
of
this
thing
somebody
deserves
a
wellearned
high
five
for
the
joke
of
classifying
this
a
baltic
porter
good
one
it
goes
down
smooth
but
is
a
little
overcarbonated
for
me
not
as
thick
as
most
baltic
porters
but
certainly
makes
up
for
it
in
smell
and
nice
taste
an
absolute
must
for
porter
fans
drinkability
this
is
very
good
and
with
a
wine
bottle
size
serving
left
to
consume
that
is
a
good
thing
easy
to
drink
and
very
malty
just
like
i
like
beer
would
i
seek
it
out
again
probably
not
the
serving
size
is
a
little
too
restrictive
overall
this
is
definitely
belgian
in
style
more
like
a
belgian
double
or
strong
dark
ale
than
a
baltic
porter
given
how
belgian
porters
and
stouts
come
out
this
is
to
be
expected
its
enjoyable
drinkable
and
tastes
very
nice
even
if
it
isnt
really
a
porter
as
most
of
us
known
them
in
fact
the
thin
feel
was
the
only
thing
that
really
hurt
the
beer
in
the
end
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
good
interesting
and
unique
belgian
like
a
strong
dark
or
a
dubbel
then
give
this
a
try
on
the
other
hand
if
youre
looking
for
an
english
or
american
style
porter
try
elsewhere
future
outlook
hard
to
say
a
bit
costprohibitive
given
what
it
is
but
a
solid
drinker
i
would
never
shun
partaking
in
this
brew
but
it
seems
doubtful
that
i
will
purchase
it
again
in
the
near
future
taste
is
very
fruity
with
mango
and
other
exotic
fruits
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
probably
from
the
dark
malts
the
beer
is
dark
brown
but
lacks
a
real
roasted
taste
to
be
expected
from
a
porter
which
it
obviously
isnt
body
is
thin
it
is
a
strange
belgian
experiment
that
doesnt
harm
but
enjoyable
is
a
different
thing
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
as
hell
d
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
decent
easy
to
drink
but
only
kind
of
enjoyable
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
a
touch
expensive
for
what
you
are
getting
but
a
damned
fine
beer
nevertheless
d
if
it
werent
so
costly
this
would
be
the
only
porter
i
would
ever
drink
again
i
highly
recommend
reading
classic
beer
styles
mild
ale
by
david
sutula
and
then
enjoying
one
of
these
youll
have
a
more
defined
understanding
of
how
a
real
porter
a
pint
of
plain
should
taste
i
dont
normally
grade
to
style

participant
in
the
overall

interplay
ah
well
still
good
for
what
it
is
though
and
not
for
what
i
thought
it
might
be
i
suppose
its
been
a

replacing

mouthfeel
is
round
then
dry
overall
would
have
gone
great
with
some
blue
cheese
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
was
not
expecting
much
the
addition
of
the
rye
is
what
really
made
the
beer
for
me
loved
the
label
artwork
recommended
overall
im
thoroughly
impressed
and
say
this
one
borders
on
world
class
its
a
desert
a
real
treat
the
bottle
artwork
is
what
drew
me
to
this
one
and
im
so
happy
i
bought
it
amazing
beer
as
it
warms
up
the
spices
come
out
more
giving
it
a
slight
liquorice
aroma
added
to
the
ones
i
mentioned
earlier
good
stuff
o
rye
is
a
nice
addition
to
a
pretty
traditional
porter
a
little
too
smoky
for
my
tastes
though
it
isnt
overpowering
just
kinda
masks
the
spiciness
that
i
was
really
looking
for
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
and
creamy
and
slick
overall
quite
a
good
and
easydrinking
porter
i
didnt
taste
any
pumpernickle
whatsoever
but
this
was
one
of
most
balanced
tasty
porters
ive
ever
had
nice
and
chocolately
great
mouthfeel
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
hints
of
coffee
just
a
really
great
choice
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
overall
i
got
this
for
5
bucks
and
even
though
its
no
different
than
most
baltic
porters
it
drinks
world
class
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
in
it
as
expected
the
flavor
is
a
bit
different
there
are
still
a
lot
of
porter
qualities
such
as
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
but
there
is
also
a
spiciness
and
a
pumpernickel
character
which
goes
very
well
the
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
beers
body
has
medium
levels
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
weight
not
watery
around
the
edges
at
all
resultant
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
semidry
finish
and
just
a
bit
of
stickiness
from
sugars
no
ethanol
detected
a
personal
favorite
if
you
can
come
across
it
like
baltics
and
want
to
spend
the
scandinavian
price
tag
all
the
notes
you
would
expect
out
of
a
good
baltic
porter
but
the
quality
of
this
brew
is
key
in
its
breadiness
body
is
glorious
beautiful
yeast
resilience
this
is
a
density
that
carries
everything
alone
so
nicely
nice
mesquite
meatiness
molasses
that
doesnt
dominate
like
a
lot
of
the
porters
ive
had
from
the
region
nice
and
dry
mineral
heavy
again
this
beer
is
quite
earthy
yet
balanced
and
malt
complex
that
no
one
quality
is
particularly
dominating
balance
of
bitterness
minerality
smoke
molasses
leather
apple
pie
and
fluff
the
beer
is
held
in
a
time
lock
with
the
use
of
the
minerals
causing
complete
stagnation
but
its
has
life
in
the
pumpernickel
richness

renaissance
right
now
taking
styles
which
the
americans
have
mutated
and
amplified
from
their
english

belgian
origins
turning
it
all
around
and
putting
their

twist
on
it
and

this

really

this
beer
poured
out
as
a
heavy
looking
black
liquid
the
head
was
brown
and
thick
looking
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
roasted
with
a
touch
of
spice
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
good
but
i
felt
like
it
was
missing
some
of
the
rye
flavors
perhaps
i
have
a
difficult
time
picking
up
that
specific
flavor
i
always
seem
to
struggle
with
rye
for
some
reason
its
a
good
tasting
beer
overall
though
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
im
surprised
this
is
still
a
porter
and
not
a
stout
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
around
enjoy
in
short
a

baltic
porter
verging

o
great
porter
very
nice
how
they
manage
to
capture
the
essence
of
pumpernickel
i
want
to
drink
this
again
and
will
cracking
beer
great
use
of
unusual
ingredients
to
spice
up
what
is
already
a
smooth
drinkable
brew
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
dark
tan
head
that
evaporates
quickly
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
dark
porter
with
dark
sugary
notes
mouth
feel
is
dry
rather
than
creamy
and
the
taste
is
all
dark
heavy
oily
and
rich
a
little
sweetness
upfront
with
a
tame
aftertaste
coming
more
from
the
mouth
feel
than
the
flavor
very
nice
to
drink
and
very
heavy
for
a
porter
nice
and
approachable
with
the
pumpernickel
character
pretty
well
nailed
however
the
background
is
a
bit
unremarkable
with
not
a
great
deal
else
going
on
and
no
real
surprises
as
you
get
through
it
fine
line
between
porter
and
stout
nice
black
body
with
only
a
thin
film
of
tan
head
dark
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
flavor
and
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
thick
smooth
almost
oily
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
tasty
thick
porter
loved
having
on
tap
at
775
in
reno
overall
just
a
wonderful
beer
not
sure
that
this
reminds
me
of
pumpernickel
bread
but
it
is
very
drinkable
on
the
whole
this
beer
is
not
entirely
satisfying
there
is
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
it
but
the
flavours
fail
to
excite
and
the
hotness
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
very
thick
and
creamy
3
inch
dark
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
nice
rings
of
lacing
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
dark
breads
roasted
malts
and
some
toasted
nuts
taste
is
of
dark
crusty
bread
dark
malts
and
spices
there
is
a
sourness
to
this
beer
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
can
only
attribute
to
spices
that
were
used
to
try
to
get
the
pumpernickel
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
and
the
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
to
try
a
good
attempt
to
try
to
get
a
dark
bread
flavor
but
the
sourness
and
spices
arent
that
great
in
my
opinion
as
a
homebrewer
i
truly
which
to
try
and
remake
the
flavor
of
every
artisan
bread
as
some
point
in
time
or
another
pumpernickel
appears
to
me
to
be
one
of
those
more
difficult
ones
this
is
a
very
dirty
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
sandy
foam
the
aroma
is
really
really
pleasant
there
is
the
sour
from
the
rye
some
interesting
spice
notes
that
i
almost
attribute
to
caraway
along
with
a
good
amount
of
molasses
its
the
next
best
thing
to
fresh
baked
the
flavors
are
a
rich
dark
chocolate
flavor
mixed
with
what
i
taste
as
caraway
seeds
or
black
pepper
then
its
all
finished
off
with
a
sweet
dark
bead
molasses
its
a
touch
too
harsh
on
my
tongue
but
its
still
a
very
well
made
beer
and
rather
enjoyable
a
couple
bottle
of
this
made
their
ways
to
me
in
nova
last
year
but
i
was
in
the
midst
of
a
reviewing
hiatus
good
to
try
it
again
it
pours
a
sleek
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
cracked
black
pepper
clove
brown
sugar
and
charred
pretzel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
some
more
pepper
and
some
bitterer
dark
chocolate
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
baltic
porter
but
id
have
to
admit
that
i
feel
it
to
be
a
bit
much
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
things
at
a
time
conclusion
i
love
traditional
baltic
porters
and
this
beer
tastes
like
one
with
the
additional
bonus
of
extrabold
chocolate
flavors
i
do
not
get
pumpernickel
per
se
but
i
do
taste
layers
of
complexity
and
wellbalanced
excellence
in
my
opinion
an
outstanding
brew
o
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
because
the
flavors
keep
the
taste
interesting
moderate
low
carbonation
could
really
be
higher
overall
rich
roasty
completely
full
bodied
a
sipper
to
be
sure
the
spiciness
lends
it
some
delicate
but
much
needed
character
i
think
a
slight
drop
in
the
original
gravity
might
conjour
a
little
more
magic
from
it
but
its
fairly
impressive
as
it
is
based
on
girth
o
very
decent
porter
nothing
thats
going
to
blow
your
mind
taste
is
a
bit
more
boring
that
the
nose
but
has
a
lot
of
porter
characteristics
coming
through
a
bit
thinner
but
has
a
nice
velvety
consistency
smooth
as
hell
a
bit
of
spice
and
rye
on
the
palate
as
well
mixing
with
the
dark
roasted
slightly
burnt
flavors
oh
so
yum
as
i
sip
i
ponder
the
thin
line
between
stout
porter
this
is
called
a
porter
but
also
a
stout
brewed
with
spices
i
guess
technically
its
a
thick
balticstyle
porter
with
ale
yeast
and
really
who
cares
its
really
good
bready
pumpernickle
that
suggests
dark
roast
coffee
and
creamy
wellcrafted
darkashell
chocolate
drinkability
is
good
pretty
well
balanced
just
a
little
of
the
alcoholic
heat
coming
through
nice
depth
the
extra
dimension
from
the
caraway
and
spice
mixes
well
with
the
base

great
nice
stuff
thanks
russ
the
aroma
is
very
large
but
the
taste
is
not
as
powerful
the
most
impressive
portion
is
the
smoothness
d
medium
plus
poured
a
massive
4
head
with
a
malted
milk
chocolate
color
not
much
bouquet
but
a
very
complex
flavor
with
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
rye
bread
nice
zing
in
the
aftertaste
really
a
prime
example
of
a
deep
dark
flavorful
porter
and
with
a
great
name
as
well
keep
em
coming
morke
i
have
been
intruiged
by
this
beeri
was
glad
to
grab
a
few
bottles
over
this
weekend
poured
into
a
imperial

atopthe

makes
a

in

chocolate
is
almost
as

and
goes

up

char
round
out
the
complex
flavors
this
is
one
damn
good
beerflavorful
as
all
get
out
and
complex
as
hell
overall
i
feel
as
though
the
pumpernickel
influence
is
larger
in
the
tap
version
than
in
the
bottle
almost
as
though
it
was
drybreaded
it
reduces
the
nose
slightly
but
anyway
you
can
find
it
it
is
worth
a
shot
d
amazing
porter
highly
drinkable
booze
is
not
present
at
all
in
this
one
the
smell
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
considering
other
porters
reputation
but
still
one
of
the
best
tasting
porters
ive
had
nothing
extraordinairy
but
i
thought
this
nevertheless
a
pretty
solid
beer
d
my
first
from
beer
here
and
it
was
quite
a
treat
hopefully
some
more
from
them
will
show
up
soon
bottle
was
a
bit
of
a
gusher
upon
opening
once
that
was
handled
it
pours
an
incredibly
dark
brown
with
thick
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
and
roated
malt
i
dont
get
pumpernickel
but
maybe
thats
just
me
smooth
mouthfeel
as
youd
expect
from
the
style
very
nice
baltic
porter
d
this
is
one
killer
baltic
porter
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
fact
on
this
cold
winters
night

with

taste
is
faintly
smoked

roasted

mouthfeel
is
full
like
of
like
chewing
tobacco
in
an
odd
but
good
way
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
overall
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
because
mørke
pumpernickel
porter
straddles
the
boundary
between
an
american
porter
and
a
baltic
porter
yet
is
categorized
as
the
latter
i
might
have
been
a
bit
overly
critical
of
it
regardless
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
nothing
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
furthermore
if
the
taste
or
aroma
showcased
more
rye
character
i
would
have
perhaps
given
it
higher
marks
overall
judging
from
the
two
beers
ive
had
from
them
this
along
with
dark
hops
beer
here
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
breweries

easily
one
of

very
solid
beer
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
sticks
around
really
does
smell
of
pumpernickel
and
licorice
the
taste
exhibits
more
of
the
pumpernickel
and
still
has
the
licorice
as
well
as
some
spice
nice
and
dry
and
spicy
with
caraway
and
swedish
licorice
rich
flavors
without
sweetness

i
like
it
chewy
in
the
mouth
but
finishes
smooth
an
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
having
notes
this
porter
is
outstanding
in
my
opinion
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
i
will
also
have
to
seek
it
out
again
as
it
was
the
last
bottle
at
the
beer
store

it

good
a

t
certainly
not
a

beer
in
fact
its
one
that
i
enjoyed
a
great
deal
and
would
enjoy
again
possibly
a
beer
that
didnt
quite
live
up
to
its
potential
in
my
mind
but
certainly
a
worth
brew
nonetheless
d
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
very
well
executed
i
have
trouble
finding
faults
in
this
beer
worth
seeking
out
d
the
pumpernickel
flavor
while
interesting
detracts
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
but
its
still
a
very
good
porter
overall
for
a
spiced
beer
this
is
pretty
great
nice
flavors
all
around
with
the
spices
not
over
powering
the
other
flavors
very

notes

possibly

the
flavour
has
notes
of
pumpernickel
bread
no
surprise
fennel

coffee
and
dark

hints
of

an
impressive
well
made
and
tasty
beer
but
if
anything
i
would
perhaps
recommend
going
a
bit
easier
on
the
fennel
seeds
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
something
that
blended
and
changed
so
much
as
it
warmed
up
just
over
5
minutes
loved
it
went
great
with
cheddar
pours
a
nice
dark

brown

and
a
drity

smells
of

fruits
maybe
a
little
coco
and
fig
surprisingly
not
too
much
roasted
toasted

tastes
a
hint
of

up

balanced
with
the

maybe
a
hint
of
coco
again
not

much
roasted
toasted
malt
up

lighter
then
what
i
was
expecting
the
finish
is
a
hint
more
bitter
than
the
middle
but
in
general
a
decent
balance
with
a
firm
hop
finish
overal
a
lighter
beer
than
what
the
eye
may
tell
you
the
lighter
character
of
the
pumpernickel
versus
malt
may
be
why
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
think
and
drinability
is
better
than
average
a
solid
beer
with
no
complaints
d
i
really
enjoyed
the
way
this
beer
smelled
but
the
flavor
was
just
off
in
some
way
it
did
not
seem
to
match
up
with
my
expectations
from
the
nose
500

served
in
a
nonic

the
beer
pours
dark

about
a

and

are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
roasted

dark

pumpernickel

and
some

the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
coffee

charredburnt

in
there
the
brew
has
a
good
lingering

is

its
coating
and
creamy
and
its
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
smooth
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
brew
overall
i
recommend
it
due
to
the
price
its
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
in
the
future
notes
eh
its
not
the
great
for
me
a
little
too
dark
a
little
too
bitter
for
what
i
feel
like
drinking
right
now
i
split
a
bomber
and
definitely
was
not
looking
for
anymore
pours

with

on

i
taste
juniper
in
here
somewhere
too
again
the
sweetspice
combination
is
unique
and
very
tasty
but
eventually
wears
out
my
palate
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chalky
at
times
but
wellcarbonated
and
light
on
the
tongue
at
others
to
say
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
wouldnt
be
too
far
off
but
most
of
the
elements
really
work
well
together
to
make
for
an
enjoyable
original
beer
experience
really
been
impressed
with
the
two
offerings
ive
had
from
beer
here
although
i
shouldnt
be
too
surprisedthe
exølfabrikken
brewer
now
makes
beer
here
and
both
have
put
out
exceptional
baltic
porters
d
whoa
this
was
my
first
beer
here
beer
and
it
was
so
good
i
want
to
go
right
out
and
pick
up
a
bottle
of
dark
hops
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
coating
almost
chewy
this
is
a
rather
thick
solid
porter
all
things
considered
however
this
was
quite
drinkable
one
the
right
night
preferably
in
the
autumn
i
could
see
drinking
two
bombers
of
this
its
fairly
heavy
but
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
porter
by
the
danes
and
absolutely
fantastic
brilliant
drinkability
i
thought
was
pretty
good
probably
a
nice
sipper
due
to
the
big
roasty
malts
and
spice
overall
a
very
good
offering
and
one
that
i
would
purchase
and
drink
again
a
tasty
baltic
porter
but
one
that
should
be
shared
drinkability
very
impressive
though
i
would
not
have
called
it
a
baltic
porter
another
one
of
those
beers
that
defies
a
style
but
is
still
very
very
good
the
beer
is
super
creamy
and
it
has
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
fine
porter
caramel
roasted
grainy
malts
chocolate
flavors
some
mocha
there
are
lots
of
charred
notes
to
this
beer
some
hard
to
pin
down
spices
and
a
slightly
biting
hop
presence
there
is
a
bit
of
spice
in
this
beer
and
plenty
of
smoked
woody
flavors
there
is
plenty
of
abv
present
on
the
tongue
and
some
sweeter
malts
underneath
this
is
a
very
characteristic
and
assertive
baltic
porter
im
not
all
that
crazy
about
the
tooupfront
abv
presence
and
the
smoked
woody
flavors
im
also
not
a
particular
fan
of
if
its
a
baltic
porter
that
you
want
than
this
is
one
hits
the
mark
on
the
head
the
aftertaste
is
slight
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
creamy
but
quite
mild
overall
this
beer
is
quite
chewy
and
milk
shake
like
thick
d
good
i
liked
both
beer
here
beers
i
tried
tonight
a
really
well
done
balanced
stout
or
porter
worth
trying
if
you
can
very
well
done
but
would
remain
a
special
occasion
beer
for
me
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
morke
great
aromas
flavors
and
gasp
drinkability
500

the

it
just
glides
over
the
palate
with
exactly
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
low
and
restrained
really
a
joy
to
drink
drinkability
an
interesting
tasting
beer
that
does
not
taste
like
any
other
baltic
porters
i
have
had
this
has
several
layers
of
flavor
and
is
very
complex
very
good
for
the
style
but
probably
not
good
enough
to
justify
me
getting
it
again
at
the
highish
price
overall
this
is
a
really
bomb
ass
beer
bomb
ass
hopefully
these
guys
start
sending
more
of
their
beer
here
because
the
two
ive
had
so
far
have
been
great

i
cant

for

a

a

takes
over

i

this

great
with

i
will
preface
this
by
saying
that
i
absolutely
hate
smoked
beers
but
this
was
really
enjoyable
im
done
doubting
mr

the
hype
is

near

with
a
lacy

of
roasted

a
little

bit

and
floral

the
same
with
a
nice
combo
of
dark

smoky
malts
smooth
texture
a
really
well
executed
take
on
the
style
overall
a
flat
out
stunning
porter
by
shaun
another
masterpiece
the
inquisitive
ale
is
highly
characterful
as
it
goes
from
smooth
and
creamy
to
dry
powdery
and
slight
ash
in
a
hurry
it
takes
quite
a
journey
over
top
the
palate
in
short
order
fear
and
trembling
is
as
much
of
an
experience
for
the
mind
and
memory
as
it
is
for
the
taste
buds
a
wonderful
beer
im
trying
not
to
be
one
sided
with
the
whole
hf
thing
but
this
is
my
first
offering
from
then
and
its
fucking
mindblowing
overall
another
excellent
porter
from
hf
complex
and
interesting
with
appreciated
constraint
with
the
use
of
the
smoked
malts
here
too
much
of
which
can
be
offputting
we
had
the
three
barrel
aged
versions
a
while
back
and
those
were
outstanding
as
well
finally
nice
to
try
the
base
beer
as
well
fantastic
stuff
rutager
thanks
again
overall
a
great
beer
ill
be
honest
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
baltic
porters
and
havent
had
more
than
maybe
6
to
8
beers
in
the
style
but
this
will
stand
out
in
my
memory
as
one
that
expressed
great
balance
and
an
incredible
mouthfeel
maybe
the
year
of
age
on
it
toned
down
the
typical
roasty
smokey
characteristics
of
baltics
and
brought
out
an
underlying
sweetness
that
played
well
with
the
other
nuances
baltics
by
nature
at
least
the
ones
ive
tried
are
really
dry
this
had
a
milky
sweetness
that
made
it
more
enjoyable
for
me
o
overall
i
dug
this
beer
more
than
the
barrel
treatments
i
had
a
while
back
really
enjoyable
baltic
porter
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
smoke
and
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
smoke
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
smoke
presence
that
is
slightly
better
in
the
aroma
overall
fear
and
trembling
is
a
great
baltic
porter
and
another
great
beer
from
hf
i
hope
to
have
it
again
soon
minimal
smoke
in
the
taste
with
smooth
roast
body
shows
the
baltic
porter
style
well
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
cold
or
as
it
warmed
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
the
body
is
so
well
done
like
any
hf
beer
ive
had
very
refined
high
end
version
of
the
baltic
porter
style
smoke
adds
some
complexity
to
the
nose
but
little
else
very
good
beer
o
this
was
my
first
hf
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
overall
a
real
solid
baltic
porter
i
liked
it
a
lot
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
but
the
bottle
lost
some
of
the
creaminess
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
in
general
but
again
this
is
just
an
outstanding
brew
thats
been
expertly
crafted
another
extremely
impressive
hill
farmstead
offering
now
i
have
to
find
the
barrelaged
variations
overall
the
smokey
aspect
suits
the
style
well
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
like
most
hf
beers
ive
tried
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
rich
black
color
with
some
dark
brown
hues
around
the
edges
the
head
is
tan
in
color
with
a
light
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
definitely
smoked
there
is
a
light
chocolate
roasted
aroma
in
there
as
well
but
the
wood
and
smoke
are
most
prominent
the
taste
is
roasted
again
the
smoke
comes
out
right
away
but
doesnt
linger
or
turn
into
a
salty
baconlike
flavor
which
is
good
the
smoked
essence
is
minimal
enough
that
i
still
enjoyed
this
brew
but
could
see
the
path
they
were
headed
in
very
dark
malt
driven
beer
which
is
how
it
should
be
in
this
style
the
mouthfeel
was
heavy
and
thick
with
a
good
carbonation
as
well
overall
this
beer
is
very
its
not
one
i
would
track
down
and
go
completely
crazy
over
but
still
was
a
nice
one
to
try
o
very
solid
porter
has
all
facets
you
want
to
see
chocolate
coffee
and
slight
sweetness
if
you
dont
like
smoke
beers
dont
be
afraid
to
try
this
one
slight
smoke
that
works
very
well
in
this
beer
note
bottled
january
2013
o
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
there
is
a
very
nice
amount
of
complexity
in
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
nice
addition
of
smoked
malts
without
getting
into
the
medicinal
flavors
or
aromas
well
balanced
and
one
to
enjoy
o
smokey
and
silky
nice
for
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
another
great
beer
from
hf
no
surprise
there
the
smoke
plays
a
big
role
in
this
one
but
doesnt
dominate
overall
i
feel
a
little
conflicted
about
this
beer
nothing
is
particularly
wrong
with
this
beer
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
i
cant
say
id
make
a
point
of
drinking
it
again
its
a
nice
integration
of
smoked
malt
and
the
smoke
element
is
far
from
overpowering
but
that
flavor
note
has
just
never
been
one
ive
been
crazy
about
in
the
end
though
its
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
and
you
have
an
affinity
for
baltic
porters
andor
smoked
beers
of
any
kind
its
near
black
with
a
fleeting
tan
head
leaving
a
etched
top
smells
of
toasted
malts
richly
of
bitter
coffee
grounds
some
soil
some
vinyl
and
a
good
chunk
of
leather
flavor
is
very
leathery
with
some
meat
flavor
well
done
flank
sans
spice
some
soil
much
less
sweet
than
most
baltics
ive
had
full
bodied
with
sharp
but
limited
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
nice
beer
not
among
the
best
baltics
ive
had
but
a
yummy
beer
best
suited
for
a
rich
irishenglish
meat
and
potatoes
style
dinner
m
medium
body
with
a
huge
chew
creamy
and
silky
light
carbonation
perfect
mouthfeel
for
the
style
o
a
tasty
baltic
porter
the
smoked
malt
is
a
nice
twist
saisons
definitely
seem
to
be
his
strength
but
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
hf
oeasily
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
had
the
smoke
was
not
off
putting
and
balanced
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
went
in
expecting
an
acrid
brew
showcasing
smoked
malt
but
instead
found
a
decedent
dessert
porter
pleasantly
surprised
overall
this
is
outstanding
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
months
and
at
ths
point
it
is
easily
my
favorite
from
hill
farmstead
the
balance
of
flavors
is
done
with
a
deft
hand
very
well
crafted
and
delicious
i
want
another
bottle
or
10
o
this
beer
is
impressive
it
has
a
great
tasty
and
unique
smoke
flavor
while
not
being
overwhelming
and
balancing
with
other
flavors
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
clearly
extremely
well
crafted
and
worth
a
try
100
especially
if
you
like
smoked
beer
then
this
is
a
must
try
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
essential
stuff
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
a
huge
dose
of
malt
sausage
campfire
baltic
character
rauchbier
quality
burnt
sausage
and
bacon
with
smokey
campfire
flavor
delicious
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
smoked
brews
and
i
do
this
is
for
you
just
delicious
thanks
colin
very
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
give
this
one
a
go
o
very
tasty
porter
very
enjoyable
i
would
put
this
in
my
top
10
list
of
favorite
porters
i
really
enjoy
smokey
porters
and
this
one
is
kind
of
the
ideal
smokey
porter
the
smokiness
is
strong
but
i
dont
feel
its
overpowering
although
i
can
see
why
people
would
think
so
its
not
one
of
the
best
hf
beers
but
i
definitely
like
this
one
and
would
buy
it
again
i
can
definitely
enjoy
this
porter
on
a
chilly
or
cold
night
viscous
and
full
bodied
with
a
slight
creamy
texture
and
a
very
nice
rich
smoke
flavor
thats
decently
integrated
into
the
roasted
porter
notes
very
dry
and
bitter
up
front
with
hints
of
charred
wood
ash
charcoal
and
barbecued
bacon
countered
by
deeply
roasted
dark
chocolate
malt
burnt
coffee
and
oatmeal
the
abv
is
well
masked
but
the
malt
tastes
more
burnt
than
smoked
lingering
acrid
bitterness
hurts
the
flavor
and
drinkability
a
bit
theres
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
balancing
things
out
but
this
beer
needs
more
of
that
im
a
huge
fan
of
smoke
beers
but
theres
something
slightly
off
here
still
an
enjoyable
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
overall
nice
beer
good
smoke
good
black
malts
nice
hop
profile
creamy
and
smooth
booze
hidden
well
a
well
done
beer
taste
is
all
smoke
again
with
a
hint
of
more
smoke
again
porter
notes
seep
through
every
once
in
a
while
but
they
are
smothered
by
the
smoke
little
char
notes
make
an
appearance
its
not
hf
best
offering
but
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
smoked
porters
out
there
its
solid
would
i
seek
it
out
again
no
its
a
one
and
done
beer
had
it
and
move
on
all
the
porter
characteristics
were
there
however
i
felt
this
was
overwhelmingly
smoky
by
far
my
least
favorite
hf
offering
o
overall
a
solid
beer
damn
good
baltic
porter
though
perhaps
a
hair
too
smokey
for
my
liking
overall
well
executed
and
one
of
the
few
smoked
beers
i
have
enjoyed
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
this
is
right
up
there
with
alaskan
smoked
as
the
best
ive
ever
had
really
great
stuff
quite
good
have
grown
to
prefer
a
meatier
smokiness
as
opposed
to
a
woody
smoke
but
its
still
great
very
drinkable
a
friend
brought
me
back
a
growler
from
vt
poured
into
stemmed
glasses
dark
brown
body
with
light
beige
head
tons
of
smoke
aroma
up
front
taste
was
a
great
blend
of
smoke
chocolate
and
wood
very
nice
body
which
was
perfect
for
a
baltic
porter
but
smooth
enough
to
make
an
over
9
beer
very
drinkable
overall
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
quite
a
treat
so
thanks
to
joey
g
the
beer
pours
a
deep
murky
black
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
dissipates
and
thinly
blankets
the
nose
is
smokey
but
sweet
reminiscent
of
a
smore
thanks
tom
for
the
analogy
minus
the
gram
cracker
the
taste
presents
an
initial
caramelized
sweetness
with
a
modest
infusion
of
smoke
metal
and
fruit
err
im
not
sure
what
hand
smoked
over
native
woods
means
exactly
but
im
hoping
to
try
a
beer
aged
on
one
of
darrens
stellar
looking
chairs
at
some
point
this
is
a
very
drinkable
baltic
porter
with
great
fruitycaramel
sweetness
smooth
thick
body
yet
is
supremely
smoky
and
saturates
your
palate
without
dominating
it
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
a
definitely
must
try
this
beer
and
the
0
5l
size
is
the
perfect
size
for
2
healthy
samples
o
this
was
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
that
definitely
lived
up
to
my
expectations
this
isnt
the
smokiest
baltic
porter
but
the
balance
between
the
smoked
malt
and
the
luscious
chocolate
is
spot
on
in
my
opinion
this
is
another
grand
slam
by
hf
and
a
must
try
for
any
smoked
baltic
porter
fan
the
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
layer
of
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
thick
ring
around
the
pour
in
the
nose
im
getting
smoke
and
dark
fruit
along
with
a
malt
sweetness
and
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
follows
from
the
smell
im
really
liking
the
smoke
and
there
is
just
enough
sweet
malt
to
back
it
up
the
mild
dark
fruit
notes
and
the
roast
work
well
with
everything
else
the
finish
is
smokey
and
bitter
the
body
is
medium
with
smooth
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
another
great
porter
from
hill
farmstead
so
much
flavor
complexity
and
balance
in
such
a
drinkable
beer
the
smoke
is
almost
perfectly
balanced
with
sweetness
from
the
malt
it
definitely
fits
into
the
category
of
a
smoked
beer
more
than
a
baltic
porter
for
me
it
is
a
great
beer
no
matter
how
you
classify
it
though
o
i
havent
had
too
many
darker
brews
from
hf
but
this
one
is
definitely
my
favorite
so
far
and
thats
really
saying
a
lot
cause
i
normally
dont
like
a
smoked
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
again
o
this
masterpiece
of
hill
farmstead
was
undoubtedly
worth
the
numbingly
cold
wait
in
line
and
18
it
took
to
get
in
my
possessionsomething
i
cannot
say
about
many
other
beers
i
enjoy
many
of
hill
farmsteads
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
onot
usually
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
this
is
so
wellbalanced
and
has
a
great
flavor
profile
that
i
will
be
drinking
more
edit
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
and
it
was
much
better
smoother
finish
first
sip
reveals
a
great
balance
of
smoked
beer
and
porter
qualities
most
other
smoked
porters
ive
had
seem
to
seriously
lack
on
the
smoked
side
of
things
but
this
one
gets
right
up
there
with
a
big
but
not
overpowering
woody
smoke
flavor
and
of
course
as
one
would
expect
from
hf
even
without
the
smoked
malt
this
porter
would
be
among
the
best
creamy
and
a
bit
sweet
but
not
cloying
at
all
chocolate
and
maple
notes
pair
well
with
the
smokey
character
nice
fullbodied
mouth
feel
but
its
scary
how
easily
this
beer
goes
down
at
9
abv
pours
a
dark
clearish
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
nose
of
smoked
malt
cocoa
vanilla
more
sweet
than
bitter
smooth
flavor
of
a
rich
porter
that
is
complemented
by
the
smoked
malt
and
not
overwhelmed
by
it
i
liked
holger
danske
but
id
think
if
that
was
too
much
smoke
for
someone
this
would
be
an
agreeable
compromise
with
the
fuller
richer
body
and
sweeter
dark
fruit
and
cocoa
like
flavor
ill
definitely
give
it
another
try
once
a
future
batch
rolls
around
because
it
was
otherwise
a
pretty
solid
beer
flavor
is
sweet
and
extremely
chocolatey
initially
becoming
roasty
and
dry
almost
chalky
mid
palate
and
finishing
coffeelike
dark
cherry
notes
are
muted
but
would
probably
meld
well
with
time
would
love
to
see
this
with
some
age
on
it
very
viscous
rich
body
just
a
tad
too
bitter
that
chalky
character
becomes
offputting
glass
snifter
balanced
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
dark
chocolate
molasses
dark
fruit
o
big
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
some
nice
smoky
notes
o
a
solid
baltic
porter
delicious
but
not
too
heavy
the
9
0
abv
hides
well
keeping
this
a
relatively
easy
drinker
that
could
pack
a
serious
punch
o
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
balancing
its
sweet
and
bitter
characteristics
into
an
enjoyable
medley
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
very
dark
with
tan
head
i
was
supprised
by
the
complexity
yet
smooth
drinkability
of
this
porter
the
mouthfeel
was
very
silky
this
is
just
a
darn
good
baltic
porter
and
i
will
be
buying
this
whenever
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
o
overall
a
solid
baltic
porter
overall
a
decent
brew
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
this
is
pretty
decent
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
porter
that
i
am
very
happy
that
i
got
to
try
a
really
tasty
beer
the
flavors
are
intense
but
not
over
the
top
great
sweet
creaminess
thats
balanced
perfectly
with
dark
roastiness
theres
a
lot
of
coffeelike
flavor
and
aroma
in
topless
wytch
which
was
great
so
id
love
to
see
what
three
floyds
could
do
with
a
straightup
coffee
stout
or
porter
three
floyds
topless
wytch
3
55
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
id
get
it
every
time
i
see
it
at
the
brew
pub
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
thick
mildy
csrbonated
and
heavy
bodied
not
very
lager
like
this
was
leading
its
way
to
being
a
remarkable
ale
until
i
actually
tasted
it
and
found
it
to
be
lethargic
and
boring
overall
decent
example
of
a
baltic
porter
that
is
earthier
and
more
bitter
than
usual
id
have
liked
a
more
malty
chocolatey
porter
but
this
isnt
bad
by
any
means
o
really
surprised
by
the
lack
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
since
its
three
floyds
but
not
in
a
bad
way
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
if
i
have
a
chance
o
people
might
expect
this
to
be
a
hopped
up
brew
because
its
from
three
floyds
it
seems
spot
on
for
a
baltic
porter
to
me
and
is
quite
enjoyable
reminded
me
a
of
grande
cuvée
porter
baltique
les
trois
mousquetaires
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
overall
lets
stick
to
brewing
highly
drinkable
to
style
brews
like
this
three
floyds
keep
doing
what
youre
doing
with
zombie
dust
and
dreadnaught
stop
making
weird
stuff
like
man
o
awe
satans
subordinate
the
topless
wytch
will
take
advantage
of
you
like
she
has
me
shes
soothing
reassuring
and
persuasive
shes
known
as
eve
in
the
middle
east
and
will
steal
your
soul
youll
try
and
stop
but
theres
no
chance
now
just
give
in

very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable

having
a

this
beer
is
in
the

class
with
those

supplanting
more
toasty
character
than
that
of
roast
the
beer
is
soft
supple
and
drinkable
in
comparison
even
though
its
body
and
power
suggests
something
bigger
thanks
to
jbuddle
for
sending
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
served
from
bottle
into
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
massively
dark
brown
with
a
very
light
tan
half
finger
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
nutty
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
dark
chocolate
and
subtle
milk
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
this
one
was
fairly
well
balanced
and
had
quite
a
bit
going
on
throughout
it
however
it
didnt
really
standout
from
some
of
the
more
exceptional
brews
ive
had
from
the
style
unfortunately
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
could
definitely
get
you
in
a
lot
of
trouble
if
you
arent
careful
definitely
worth
your
time
trying
this
one
if
you
have
not
done
so
before
this
one
was
a
bit
disappointing
for
me
im
not
sure
if
its
because
it
came
from
three
floyds
or
if
it
was
just
subpar
in
general
the
flavors
were
there
but
they
were
rather
faint
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
didnt
have
anything
that
made
it
stand
out
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
its
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
this
pours
a
brown
with
a
faint
translucent
quality
slight
head
as
well
it
smells
malty
it
tastes
like
a
porter
but
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
better
considering
that
it
came
from
three
floyds
it
has
a
medium
body
o
three
floyds
does
not
do
subtle
very
well
and
im
glad
this
is
as
inyourface
as
a
baltic
porter
is
going
to
be
despite
the
lack
of
dense
piney
hops
that
three
floyds
is
known
for
still
as
far
as
dark
beers
go
its
a
style
i
wouldnt
prefer
over
something
like
a
stout
an
old
ale
or
even
an
english
porter
thought
thats
not
to
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
thin
halo
of
a
tan
head
its
nose
is
slightly
roasty
with
a
touch
of
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
roasty
slightly
fruity
with
a
bit
if
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lingering
sweetness
overall
this
is
an
interesting
baltic
porter
from
fff
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
for
sure
but
not
my
favorite
o
thus
far
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
all
of
the
three
floyds
offerings
i
have
tried
while
this
one
does
not
live
up
to
the
some
of
the
others
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
would
happily
have
again
it
has
more
flavor
than
some
of
the
watery
baltic
porters
i
have
tried
in
the
past
chocolate
roasty
dark
fruit
notes
all
contribute
to
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
despite
the
lack
of
head
in
the
world
of
fff
beers
this
isnt
near
the
top
but
it
is
good
compared
to
the
entire
craft
beer
world
overall
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
with
a
plesant
warming
that
will
be
nice
on
a
cold
winter
night
probably
my
least
favorite
three
floyds
beer
ever
not
much
going
on
for
me
o
this
is
a
great
brew
very
simple
and
well
done
the
best
of
its
style
o
this
beer
has
nice
dark
char
notes
in
a
big
but
nice
drinking
porter
with
a
much
softer
hop
profile
that
remember
othe
balance
here
was
just
great
does
not
approach
everett
level
but
still
a
top
level
porter
the
beer
is
dark
mahogany
with
an
inch
of
soapy
foamy
beige
head
aromas
of
chocolates
dark
fruit
sweet
fruits
with
some
cherry
notes
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
espresso
raisins
prunes
dates
figs
etc
perhaps
a
mild
hop
bitterness
might
help
to
balance
the
equation
a
bit
finishes
sweet
definitely
a
bottle
for
sharing
as
the
sweet
character
becomes
cloying
o
not
a
bad
beer
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
even
for
the
style
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
bring
a
lot
of
complexity
and
just
falls
a
little
flat
for
my
tastes
flavors
of
dry
and
bitter
chocolate
fairly
substantial
and
flavorful
thankfully
not
sweet
as
many
baltic
porters
can
be
body
is
somewhat
light
to
medium
some
perceptible
alcohol
traces
in
there
as
it
warms
roasty
malt
and
lingering
bitterness
doesnt
seem
especially
hoppy
a
rarity
for
fff
though
true
to
their
history
of
nailing
certain
classic
styles
worth
a
try
looking
forward
to
this
again
on
draft
as
the
weather
starts
to
cool
off
although
i
had
this
many
times
on
tap
including
this
past
weekend
i
decided
to
review
the
bottled
version
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
a
one
and
half
finger
beige
head
that
slowly
dissipates
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
some
roastiness
and
very
dark
chocolate
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
dominate
through
the
midpalate
and
finishes
dry
with
some
alcohol
warmth
roasted
malt
and
mild
espressotinged
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
fairly
slick
and
smooth
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
potent
brew
and
was
very
happy
to
see
three
floyds
finally
bottle
it
not
overly
complex
but
topless
wytch
is
a
very
solid
baltic
porter
and
the
perfect
choice
for
a
chilly
autumn
or
early
winter
evening
o
prett
muted
allaround
some
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
flavors
o
a
nice
bp
that
ive
never
several
times
in
several
different
locations
a
little
easier
to
drink
because
its
not
quite
as
sweet
as
most
others
in
this
style
and
not
cloying
at
all
good
stuff
o
a
very
solid
baltic
porter
not
overly
complex
but
the
flavors
all
compliment
each
other
d
aroma
was
soso
taste
made
up
for
it
the
chocolate
isnt
overbearing
but
im
not
convinced
that
this
is
as
wellintegrated
as
it
could
be
o
its
a
bit
onenote
not
quite
as
complex
or
as
extreme
i
had
hoped
for
from
fff
but
overall
a
nice
baltic
porter
it
was
good
for
the
style
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
the
rare
rotating
brew
from
fff
poured
in
a
tulip
at
the
pub
dark
brown
with
a
dark
tan
head
it
slowly
recedes
with
nice
lacing
smell
is
chocolate
coffee
malt
flavor
is
strong
of
barley
and
coffee
with
a
nice
hop
balance
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
nice
beer
its
a
touch
thin
in
body
but
nothing
egregious
nicely
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
touch
shy
of
good
perhaps
if
this
werent
billed
as
a
baltic
porter
it
would
score
higher
its
a
bit
onenote
and
that
note
is
chocolate
tasty
but
also
underwhelming
considering
the
source
on
tap
pours
a
beautiful
pitch
black
without
any
light
able
to
peek
through
a
small
whitetan
head
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
roasted
almost
burnt
malts
dominated
the
nose
first
sip
is
deep
roasted
malts
slight
dried
dark
fruits
and
some
coffee
notes
present
mouthfeel
is
top
notch
as
it
is
super
creamy
and
a
real
joy
slightly
under
carbonated
but
oh
so
slightly
and
certainly
not
a
flaw
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
and
most
appreciated
very
tasty
o
its
not
bad
at
all
dont
get
me
wrong
but
it
is
somewhat
middleoftheroad
t
this
is
nothing
like
the
smell
i
get
a
lot
of
roast
with
a
bit
of
a
smoky
aspect
that
reminds
me
of
cigar
smoke
a
bit
of
toffee
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
towards
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
way
thin
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
from
this
5202011
o
good
beer
like
it
more
than
a
lot
of
baltic
porters
and
would
drink
again
very
nice
porter
dark
appearance
with
some
cascade
as
it
formed
the
head
little
to
no
lacing
nose
was
nice
with
a
coffee
and
roasted
malt
scent
taste
followed
nicely
to
make
a
very
balanced
enjoyable
porter
abv
was
very
well
hidden
drank
much
easier
than
a
9
abv
beer
should
i
would
drink
this
one
again
in
a
heartbeat
pours
as
a
black
colored
brew
with
a
nice
decent
sized
head
its
got
some
tan
lacing
down
the
glass
chocolaty
aroma
and
heavily
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
not
much
hops
coming
off
this
chocolate
burnt
toast
and
smoke
flavors
on
the
tongue
on
every
sip
creamy
and
dry
mouthfeel
this
brew
all
around
it
rather
good
very
glad
i
tried
it
its
hard
to
believe
that
its
been
over
a
year
since
i
last
had
this
brew
at
the
2010
dld
how
time
flies
anyway
it
pours
a
solid
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
molasses
dark
chocolate
burnt
toffee
and
cocoa
powder
the
taste
holds
notes
of
roasted
malts
bitter
dark
chocolate
yogurt
straight
plain
yall
flowers
pine
light
mint
and
balsa
somehow
all
of
these
components
combine
to
form
a
nice
hoppyish
baltic
porter
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
one
that
shows
that
you
can
add
some
hops
to
the
style
without
completely
ruining
it
drinkable
yep
overall
very
good
beer
of
my
favorite
style
d
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
slightly
dull
one
for
3
floyds
wellcrafted
and
surprisingly
traditional
just
not
my
favorite
offering
from
these
guys
due
to
the
flavor
and
somewhat
poorly
hidden
alcohol
to
heavy
to
have
multiple
glasses
nonetheless
really
enjoyed
this
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
not
even
a
hint
of
heat
or
alcohol
very
ease
sipper
will
definitely
grab
this
again
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
the
floyds
very
rarely
am
i
disappointed
in
their
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
sampled
this
at
goose
islands
stout
fest
and
then
again
later
that
evening
at
three
floyds
brewpub
this
beer
poured
a
black
with
a
light
khaki
head
it
allowed
a
little
light
to
pass
through
so
wasnt
as
dark
or
thick
in
body
as
it
couldve
been
the
aromas
were
sweet
malty
and
rich
there
was
some
light
chocolate
to
it
with
perhaps
some
dark
fruit
the
flavors
werent
as
prevalent
as
i
would
have
liked
there
was
light
smokiness
along
with
chocolate
and
light
dark
fruit
sweetness
it
was
just
ok
for
the
style
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
thin
for
a
baltic
porter
this
beer
was
ok
but
wasnt
anything
to
search
out
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
quite
drinkable
due
to
a
light
refreshing
taste
and
well
masked
abv
topless
wytch
had
the
headache
dark
malts
see
my
beerthoughts
arrives
dark
brown
almost
black
with
an
inch
of
foamy
tan
head
that
lingers
aroma
is
all
roasted
malts
taste
is
dry
and
sharp
bitter
and
edged
served
off
the
hand
pump
it
is
creamy
and
coffee
rich
with
chocolate
far
in
the
background
roasty
and
rich
toasted
caramel
malts
and
toasted
barley
not
my
thing
but
a
spoton
porter
enhanced
by
casktohandpump
engine
creaminess
pours
near
black
with
a
bit
of
a
head
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
roast
as
well
as
loads
of
dark
fruit
in
addition
to
some
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
really
brings
forward
some
dark
cherries
dates
and
plums
with
good
roasted
coffee
fairly
full
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
try
for
a
porter
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
cannot
get
enough
of
thanks
to
steamhead
and
joepat
for
delivery
of
a
sixtel
of
this
delightful
brew
for
sharing
at
the
recent
bowling
green
ba
gathering
creamy
mocha
head
and
midnight
liquid
everything
a
baltic
porter
should
be
assertive
but
not
overbearing
with
a
big
body
and
dense
flavor
profile
of
deeply
roasted
nearly
charred
malt
flavors
and
dark
dried
fruit
notes
in
the
background
finish
is
a
lingering
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
coffee
very
nicely
done
d
at
least
fair
i
could
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
3
5
overall
a
decent
baltic
porter
very
roasted
with
light
smoke
notes
slow
drinking
high
abv
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
many
flavors
here
m
despite
being
a
big
dark
beer
in
the
summer
begs
to
be
sipped
over
and
over
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
smooth
balanced
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
d
i
enjoyed
this
porter
a
lot
i
thought
it
was
well
balanced
and
would
love
to
try
it
again
quite
impressive
just
delicious
d
this
was
a
very
interesting
take
on
this
style
and
i
must
say
like
usual
3
floyds
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
the
near
future
well
finally
my
first
review
here
and
this
was
a
worthwhile
brew
for
such
a
momentous
occasion
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
was
glad
to
try
if
for
sure
super
easy
to
drink
great
tasting
and
very
enjoyable
d
not
real
smooth
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
but
if
you
dont
mind
the
alcohol
aftertaste
its
ok
as
a
sipping
beer
fullbodied
and
smoothish
with
a
dry
finish
warming
all
over
the
palate
and
the
throat
very
good
stuff
though
the
nose
is
left
out
somewhat
and
that
drags
the
whole
down
some
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
one
more
as
the
style
is
a
favorite
well
got
this
on
a
trade
in
growlwer
form
well
when
i
first
saw
it
i
thought
wow
is
this
dark
amberdark
brown
in
color
threw
me
off
as
i
poured
it
i
got
chocolate
sense
of
baking
dough
not
quite
cooked
the
smell
was
a
little
flat
for
me
as
in
there
were
not
of
alot
of
things
sticking
up
at
me
now
for
the
taste
woodsey
hoppy
and
a
spice
or
2
as
for
the
mouthfeel
this
was
one
that
was
thin
but
chewy
as
well
i
swished
it
around
for
awhile
and
it
left
a
nice
coat
of
tatse
in
my
mouth
after
i
finished
one
coould
drink
this
frequently
but
not
one
for
someone
who
is
looking
for
complex
events
to
differ
on
each
tasting
a
very
smooth
baltic
quite
clean
but
not
meager
i
was
expecting
a
bigger
brasher
beer
from
fff
overall
a
decent
baltic
porter
with
simple
flavors
and
a
bit
of
hidden
licorice
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
were
a
little
more
into
the
style
oh
yea
the
spelling
is
wytch
fyi
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
from
three
floyds
i
liked
this
one
and
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
sample
it
tastes
smooth
sweet
bitter
and
then
dry
milk
chocolate
moves
into
burnt
grainrough
unfinished
porter
maltand
then
it
moves
into
much
smoother
almost
stouty
finish
of
bitterdry
hops
medium
body
carbonation
is
soft
pretty
nice
but
a
bit
different
baltic
porter
md
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
no
alcohol
mouthfeel
or
burn
at
all
this
is
reasonably
drinkable
beer
given
the
abv
pours
a
dark
amber
with
about
a
half
inch
of
head
id
really
appreciate
more
head
but
with
a
growler
fill
carbonation
goes
down
hill
in
a
hurry
the
smell
is
nothing
special
some
roasted
malt
and
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
unique
imo
malty
with
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
without
excessive
bittering
it
tastes
a
little
too
hoppy
for
a
baltic
porter
but
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
choclate
shake
im
not
doing
justice
to
the
flavor
but
it
really
is
a
great
drinker
d
tasty
enough
to
want
more
but
it
was
not
like
most
other
baltic
porters
i
have
encountered
as
fff
will
proudly
say
its
not
normal
ive
been
waiting
for
this
beer
to
come
out
again
since
late
last
summer
this
was

a
fine
baltic
porter
from
three
floyds
d
very
i
really
liked
this
one
a
bit
more
coffee
would
have
made
it
world
class
i
would
prefer
some
other
baltic
porters
over
this
one
but
its
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
overall
a
nice
brew
i
dont
think
its
something
i
could
drink
often
but
once
in
a
while
i
would
find
it
enjoyable
sampled
at
the
brew

beer

taste

a
chocolaty

punch
backed
with
a
fair

of
hoppy
vanilla
twang
simply
it
is
very
tasty
mouthfeel
was
a
nice
blend
of
creaminess
and
some
drying
hop
oils
extremely
drinkable
i
had
to
stop
myself
from
really
going
at
that
12
pint
glass
this
is
one
brew
that
they
should
really
consider
bottling
there
arent
many
offerings
of
this
style
around
and
this
beer
is
easily
amongst
the
best

for

of

a

the

of

was
made
up
of
roasted
malts

and
a
bit
of
chocolate

flavor
consisted
of
coffee
bittersweet

smoke

also
a

are

o
got
this
one
at
grapevine
in
lakeland
fl
a
sign
said
its
a
baltic
porter
from
finland
so
it
got
me
interested
as
ive
only
had
a
few
in
this
style
and
perhaps
its
my
first
from
this
country
not
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
but
glad
to
have
found
it
especially
one
from
so
close
to
the

i
could
see
some
lees
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
so
i
was
gentle
in
my
pour
omfg
it
pours
like
heavyweight
motor
oil
no
head
and
just
wisps
as
a
result
color
was
deepbrown
srm

allowing
zero
light
penetration
i
put
my
snout
into
the
glass
and
inhaled
and
was
met
by
an
unparalleled
booziness
i
was
transported
back
to
the
bloomfield
bridge
tavern
while
stosh
was
still
alive
and
in
ownership
we
would
drink
baltic
porters
and
smoke
dark
cigars
like
parodis
and
maduros
and
shoot
the
shit
a
publican
and
a
barfly
back
to
the
present
i
took
another
sniff
and
got
dark
chocolate
pudding
i
was
reminded
of
vanilla
snak
paks
the
other
day
and
this
was
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
snak
paks
i
got
a
little
in
my
mouth
and
it
was
exactly
like
pudding
it
was
thick
viscous
kind
of
sweet
and
definitely
full
of
fusel
alcohol
heat
i
may
need
to
lay
down
after
this
one
carbonation
was
so
low
as
to
be
almost
nonexistent
warming
i
began
to
note
charcoal
smoke
anise
dark
chocolate
tar
and
still
the
unrelenting
heat
phew
this
was
no
playing
around
i
am
sure
that
it
is
much
more
appropriate
during
the
winter
months
especially
up
in
finland
but
i
just
did
not
feel
like
waiting
that
long

this
finnish
beer
was
finnishing
me
and
it
was
only
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
finnish
finnish
was
dry
duh
i
felt
like
i
had
been
caught
in
the
solar
plexus
my
breath
was
taken
this
was
a
big
brawling
monster
which
was
determined
to
send
me
back
to
my
corner
to
throw
in
the
towel
i
am
too
stupid
to
lie
down
though
which
is
how
i
won
many
of
my
fights
in
the
navy
i
would
be
half
dead
but
by
outlasting
my
opponent
i
would
win
on
points
you
dont
think
that
i
became
this
good
looking
naturally
do
you
i
reloaded
and
raised
a
toast
in
a
northeasterly
direction
towards
this
beasts
country
of
origin
i
was
rendered
nearly
insensate
and
i
suddenly
remembered
nietzsches
warning
that
when
you
gaze
long
into
an
abyss
the
abyss
also
gazes
into
you
i
was
engaged
in
advanced
navel
gazing
at
this
point
tentacles
began
to
come
forth
from
my
navel
and
i
shook
hands
before
wrestling
with
them
finally
resorting
to
knives
to
cut
them
from
whence
they
came
yet
who
would
have
thought
the
old
man
to
have
had
so
much
blood
in
him
yaaah
i
called
my
mouthpiece
for
his
learned
advice
at
this
point
and
he
advised
me
to
drink
more
of
the
same
i
love
having
jimmy
keaveney
on
retainer
suddenly
my
glass
was
empty
no
longer
marked
drink
me
and
i
was
back
in
my
bed
with
auntie
em
looking
down
at
me
asking
why
i
was
wearing
a
gingham
dress
and
ruby
slippers
while
now
sporting
a
long
beard
say
how
long
was
i
with
this
one
where
did
i
go
this
is
not
my
beautiful
wife
well
how
did
i
get
here
anyone
who
tells
you
that
sinebrychoff
porter
is
the
worlds
greatest
baltic
porter
isnt
lying
dont
get
me
wrong
theres
plenty
of
incredible
renditions
of
the
style
out
there
but
theyre
all
directly
or
indirectly
modeled
after
this
one
each
and
every
occasion
i
drink
it
becomes
a
where
were
you
when
kind
of
memory
it
remains
truly
special
stuff
even
if
as
mentioned
more
breweries
now
offer
similar
offerings
dating
back
all
the
way
to
1957
this
is
still
the
benchmark
poured
into
porter
glass
it
is
very
dark
black
with
a
caramelcolored
head
didnt
leave
much
lace
as
i
drank
it
aroma
was
roasted
burnt
coffee
and
a
mild
sweetness
my
wife
and
i
couldnt
call
the
sweetness
out
by
name
until
the
next
morning
i
took
a
whiff
of
the
warm
remnants
left
in
the
glass
and
immediately
picked
up
on
raisins
or
prunes
taste
had
average
porter
bitterness
viscosity
was
above
average
and
higher
alcohol
was
apparent
decent
aftertaste
i
think
i
actually
served
it
too
cold
at
first
maybe
40
deg
or
so
as
it
warmed
i
really
enjoyed
it
more
o
somehow
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
the
way
the
majority
seems
to
i
thought
it
tasted
mostly
coffeeish
except
for
an
unavoidable
sense
of
throwup
which
was
obviously
offputting
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
small
cap
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
charred
wood
and
vinous
oxidation
supported
by
dark
fruits
smoke
and
dark
chocolate
little
to
no
hop
aroma
or
alcohol
presence
the
flavor
is
a
hint
of
sweet
sugar
up
front
that
quickly
becomes
smokey
with
light
fruits
and
a
bit
of
wine
like
flavor
a
charred
ashy
flavor
sweeps
in
and
lingers
long
into
the
finish
of
every
sip
medium
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
full
almost
gritty
mouthfeel
big
burnt
fruity
baltic
porter
i
warmed
up
to
it
after
a
while
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
overall
i
personally
think
the
best
baltic
porters
come
from
the
scandinavian
countries
extremely
delicious
for
a
beer
that
has
traveled
thousands
of
miles
to
get
to
boston
a
really
wonderful
beer
i
enjoyed
this
and
it
surely
surprised
me
o
fantastic
sinebrychoff
reigns
supreme
as
king
of
the
baltic
porters
rich
deep
and
complex
yet
still
very
drinkable
full
of
character
and
nuance
theres
a
lot
of
legend
and
history
surrounding
this
beer
too
a
favorite
of
the
late
michael
jackson
and
a
timeless
classic
of
a
beer
my
first
beer
from
finland
really
glad
to
find
it
on
tap
as
its
one
of
the
best
porters
around
rjt
overall
very
good
beer
theres
a
tiny
bit
of
thinness
to
the
flavor
profile
that
prevents
me
from
putting
higher
than
a
4
25
but
it
is
close
its
a
must
try

a

medium

at
times
ample
carbonation
very
smooth
really
nice
to
finally
come
back
to
this
one
after
2
or
3
years
just
as
good
as
i
remember
and
always
a
favorite
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
baltic
porter
its
pretty
much
your
standard
fare
and
i
doubt
porter
and
stout
lovers
would
have
anything
bad
to
say
about
it
there
are
some
slightly
odd
characteristics
to
the
scent
and
taste
but
they
provide
a
sortof
sweetness
that
is
a
welcome
counterpart
to
the
toasty
flavor
excellent
porter
complex
very
bold
and
tasteful
they
should
quit
doing
vodka
and
dedicate
to
ales
o
a
very
solid
beer
very
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
would
certainly
have
again
o
this
is
a
great
porter
i
ate
it
with
a
hot
fudge
sundae
man
it
was
good
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
goes
down
smooth
a
very
solid
porter
in
spite
of
its
higher
alcohol
and
the
tastes
and
smell
are
profound
and
different
enough
to
make
this
beer
stand
out
overall
this
beer
is
the
best
value
for
money
that
you
can
get
in
finland
costing
only
just
over
2
euros
at
alko
and
often
some
45
euros
at
bars
effectively
half
the
price
of
many
similar
beers
unsurprisingly
this
means
that
ive
had
the
beer
many
many
times
and
will
gladly
go
back
to
it
any
time
it
deserves
the
praise
that
it
has
gotten
although
its
sometimes
better
known
outside
of
finland
although
the
koff
porter
isnt
most
chocolate
flavoured
of
stouts
or
doesnt
boast
intensive
coffee
or
strange
herbs
it
still
deserves
to
be
rated
highly
why
because
of
its
uncompromising
devotion
to
the
core
of
what
a
porter
is
supposed
to
be
its
perfectly
balanced
deep
and
truly
black
overall
this
is
my
first
baltic
porter
so
i
cant
say
how
indicative
it
is
of
the
style
but
its
pretty
damn
tasty
overall
my
only
other
experience
with
porters
has
really
been
bells
and
founders
and
in
that
sense
this
beer
is
nothing
like
those
its
got
a
very
unique
smell
and
taste
profile
overall
couldnt
find
much
information
but
it
feels
like
this
bottle
may
have
a
bit
of
age
on
it
still
big
robust
and
delicious
but
not
quite
to
the
level
of
when
i
had
it
on
tap
feel
like
some
age
has
thinned
out
a
bit
of
the
malty
presence
still
a
delicious
beer
in
a
style
that
a
lot
of
breweries
dont
produce
baltic
porter
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
baltic
porter
by
any
means
but
the
bottle
dubs
itself
plainly
as
a
porter
with
that
being
said
i
was
sort
of
torn
while
judging
because
sometimes
the
specific
style
a
beer
is
given
on
this
site
is
decided
by
anyone
who
cares
to
change
it
for
example
were
the
overly
roasty
bitter
flavors
intentional
to
try
and
recreate
the
style
brewed
in
the
1700s
who
knows
either
way
this
is
a
great
beer
maybe
not
a
93100
or
95100
imo
but
nonetheless
worth
a
try
if
you
like
portersstouts
and
havent
had
this
yet

2
oz
bottle
overall
a
really
fine
beer
not
as
fruity
as
other
baltics
but
the
ashen
flavor
adds
a
really
interesting
dimension
really
nice
one
i
can
see
how
one
could
say
its
a
thick
strong
porter
instead
of
a
stout
i
guess
but
apart
from
all
that
very
nice
complex
roasty
treat
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
a
definite
winner
in
my
book
overall
not
bad
but
i
can
go
out
and
get
other
porters
or
shouts
that
are
hop
forward
for
a
much
better
value
its
good
but
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
it
again
as
far
as
baltic
porters
go
i
still
prefer
smuttynose
but
this
is
still
quite
tasty

easy
drinking
porter
a
nice
enough
baltic
porter
fairly
complex
and
pleasurable
overall
damn
fine
looking
dark
beer
with
a
remarkably
deep
shade
on
its
head
which
is
short
but
dense
just
a
pitch
black
brew
here
speaking
to
no
lack
of
roasted
malts
smells
kind
of
earthy
kind
of
bready
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
to
it
but
nothing
real
roasty
about
the
nose
the
nose
doesnt
lie
either
not
any
roast
on
the
palate
either
and
hey
thats
alright
this
is
a
real
porter
after
all
not
some
stout
masquerading
as
one
comes
on
nice
and
sweet
almost
reminiscent
of
the
dark
fruit
and
licorice
flavors
of
big
english
styles
like
barleywine
or
old
ale
definitely
a
caramel
kind
of
sweetness
but
it
slides
gracefully
to
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
finish
certainly
a
hops
kind
of
bitterness
more
than
a
roast
type
would
never
have
guessed
that
this
has
as
much
booze
as
it
does
but
for
the
flavor
comparisons
to
other
strong
styles
mouthfeel
comes
of
as
kind
of
thin
very
little
carbonation
but
i
neither
expect
or
want
that
out
of
this
beer
the
body
is
alright
though
and
it
resists
being
too
sticky
or
viscous
as
a
package
definitely
a
remarkable
example
if
someone
asks
you
how
a
porter
is
different
than
a
stout
this
would
be
a
lovely
example
for
demonstration
of
the
distinction
which
i
personally
claim
is
the
roast
malt
character
being
stronger
in
stouts
there
simply
isnt
another
way
to
categorize
this
beer
it
is
a
porter
and
a
profound
one
at
that
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
porters
i
have
tried
cheers
truly
a
porter
for
the
stout
of
heart
o
a
great
baltic
porter
and
my
first
finish
beer
that
i
have
reviewed
this
beer
came
highly
recommended
and
did
not
disappoint
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
could
definitely
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
though
not
too
many
with
the
7
2
abv
o
very
enjoyable
goes
down
easy
nice
late
evening
sipper
o
a
delicious
beer
very
drinkable
definitely
gonna
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
lots
of
lacing
great
head
and
retention
especially
for
an
import
smooth
full
bodied
rich
and
decadent
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
gem
of
a
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
id
gladly
purchase
this
again
this
one
was
recommended
by
a
friend
of
mine
he
said
that
he
loved
it
and
that
if
i
hadnt
drank
it
before
i
should
give
one
a
try
so
i
ordered
one
up
and
poured
it
out
the
beer
was
black
as
night
and
had
a
thin
brown
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
heavily
roasted
it
had
some
light
chocolate
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
almost
like
charcoal
at
first
it
was
burnt
tasting
and
not
all
the
good
to
me
the
aftertaste
sort
of
gave
off
this
odd
creamy
flavor
not
sure
how
it
works
but
that
was
what
i
kept
getting
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
it
to
be
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
must
strike
good
with
some
people
it
seems
maybe
worth
trying
again
o
this
is
probably
my
2nd
favorite
baltic
porter
out
there
behind
only
okocim
the
european
beers
of
the
style
have
more
of
a
lightness
to
them
that
i
love
and
combining
that
with
the
dark
malts
that
typically
define
a
porter
really
make
this
a
great
beer
o
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
and
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
could
have
come
from
finland
o
i
found
it
unbalanced
but
not
all
will
personally
not
my
favorite
but
a
wellmade
brew
o
the
sinebrychoff
was
an
enjoyable
porter
i
was
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
would
have
it
again
o
a
strongly
flavored
and
excellent
baltic
porter
o
this
is
a
good
beer
i
wonder
if
the
metallic
taste
is
due
to
a
bad
bottle
overall
impression
it
was
fun
to
sample
a
bottle
that
had
been
aged
this
long
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
other
bottles
the
same
weekend
to
sample
to
have
a
point
of
comparision
certainly
a
great
beer
almost
black
with
a
medium
big
foamy
head
a
strong
burnt
chocolate
aroma
with
some
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
licorice
roasted
lightly
burned
flavor
with
hints
of
licorice
and
coffee
light
to
medium
body
hardly
any
carbonation
ok
porter
kinda
thin
1
dimensional
another
site
says
its
retired
o
a
great
surprise
to
get
to
try
this
at
a
wedding
where
i
anticipated
knocking
back
some
bmc
as
i
figured
it
would
be
my
only
option
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
with
quite
a
bit
of
character
what
a
treat
will
surely
buy
it
again
light
to
medium
thickness
in
texture
overall
an
excellent
porter
that
is
very
enjoyable
definitely
worth
a
try
o
nice
porter
but
more
similar
to
a
dry
stout
or
even
a
schwarzbier
im
a
fan
of
all
so
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
poured
a
thick
black
with
mahogany
highlights
and
a
modest
beige
head
molasses
and
caramel
in
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
indistinct
fruit
very
malty
taste
more
molasses
licorice
touches
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
figs
finishes
bitter
and
a
bit
dry
heavymedium
mouthfeel
thick
and
a
bit
oily
and
quite
drinkable
o
this
is
a
very
good
baltic
porter
definitely
worth
trying
but
for
the
price
4
45
per
bottle
i
probably
wouldnt
revisit
this
is
a
great
option
for
a
readily
available
topnotch
baltic
porter
conclusion
i
find
this
baltic
porter
to
be
a
far
cry
from
the
best
in
this
class
however
it
is
possible
that
the
bottle
i
have
obtained
is
too
old
or
there
is
some
other
problem
with
it
however
it
is
not
oxidized
and
came
from
a
store
with
a
good
track
record
o
very
enjoyable
would
have
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
if
it
was
more
silky
than
watery
but
it
still
is
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
pours
a
deep
dark
and
clean
nearblack
small
cap
of
creamy
dense
offwhite
head
scent
is
an
attractive
blend
of
roasted
matled
notes
of
dark
cocoa
dark
fruits
cherry
blackberry
and
faint
hints
of
coffee
taste
is
quite
wonerful
dark
roasted
and
toasted
matls
give
way
to
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
strong
dark
fruity
almost
like
eating
the
best
chocolate
covered
cherry
one
has
ever
had
taste
finnished
out
with
notes
of
coffee
and
a
light
nuttyness
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
lightly
dry
on
the
finnish
with
some
grainyness
on
the
tongue
quite
possibly
the
best
porter
in
the
world
deep
and
complex
almost
stoutlike
in
every
way
but
no
issues
with
excess
as
it
as
delecate
as
it
is
bold
sinebrychoff
porter
pours
a
complete
black
with
just
over
two
fingers
of
frothy
caramel
foam
topping
it
off
the
head
shows
some
staying
power
and
there
are
a
fair
amount
of
spots
of
lacing
left
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
bit
muted
but
aromas
of
bitter
espresso
and
anise
to
come
through
espresso
is
still
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
the
beer
crashes
over
my
palate
but
theres
a
bit
more
supporting
it
anise
is
largely
replaced
by
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
and
some
molasses
in
addition
theres
a
certain
fruitiness
and
lactic
twang
that
reminds
me
of
a
dry
irish
stout
the
body
is
impressively
rich
and
creamy
for
a
beer
whose
flavors
come
across
as
so
dry
and
the
carbonation
is
apppropriately
mild
staying
out
of
the
way
of
a
malt
driven
beer
sinebrychoff
porter
both
is
a
true
classic
and
a
beer
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
give
to
friends
who
dont
know
beer
past
guinness
o
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
if
i
happen
to
see
it
ontap
as
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
come
across
as
being
a
bit
smoother
and
fuller
bodied
o
not
too
bad
i
really
enjoyed
how
rustic
this
one
was
with
plenty
of
simple
flavors
working
in
tandem
to
create
an
overall
good
beer
very
nice
stuff
poured
a
1
5
quite
dark
mocha
head
body
is
black
as
coffee
smell
has
chocolate
coffee
malt
taste
is
more
of
same
but
whats
most
noteworthy
is
the
chocolate
malt
and
long
slightly
bitter
finish
have
a
definite
dark
chocolate
aspect
to
them
i
felt
like
id
munched
a
high
end
80
cocoa
bar
all
in
all
this
holds
its
own
against
a
world
of
rich
porters
well
done
overall
the
finnish
make
one
helluva
porter
that
brings
a
ton
of
roasty
characteristics
to
the
table
od
nice
stuff
quite
sessionable
and
tasty
not
world
class
but
hell
its
a
good
porter
for
a
cold
day
and
worth
a
shot
very
drinkable
and
only
3bottle
less
actually
ive
sen
this
before
and
never
grabbed
one
what
have
i
been
missing
very
worthy
this
is
a
great
porter
and
up
there
with
my
favorites
like
founders
i
would
definitely
buy
this
more
often
if
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
aroma
and
taste
roasted
malts
with
noticeable
chocolate
malts
are
the
backbone
here
more
subtle
are
flavors
of
dried
fruit
and
earthy
cocoa
bitterness
hops
kick
in
at
the
finish
giving
a
bitter
twang
which
softens
back
to
cocoa
though
seemingly
chugable
be
refined
and
savor
this
experience
you
probably
had
to
search
to
find
a
bottle
anyway
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
porter
easy
drinking
for
sure
i
can
only
imagine
how
awesome
this
would
taste
from
a
cask
or
on
tap
beautiful
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
drink
4
this
is
so
intense
and
rich
that
im
not
sure
i
could
have
more
than
a
couple
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
porter
that
deserves
its
worldclass
reputation
my
absolute
favorite
beer
to
date
and
this
coming
from
an
experienced
porter
lover
pours
a
thick
viscous
opaque
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
simply
looks
delicious
with
a
spicy
coffee
aroma
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
backed
by
a
lightly
sweet
blend
of
chocolate
toffee
and
coffee
flavors
with
notes
of
spice
and
a
deep
oak
background
mild
bite
typical
of
porters
in
the
finish
if
you
spot
this
on
the
shelf
at
your
local
beer
store
snatch
it
up
pours
a
thick
motor
oil

with
a
huge

brown
head
chunky
ring
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smells
of

coffee
cocoa
powder
roasted
dark

taste
is
like
the
nose
with
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
a
charcoallikeburnt
flavor
there
is
a
slight
vinegaracidic
twang
in
the
taste
too
light
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
light
body
makes
for
a
good
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
on
this
harder
to
find
porter
from
finland
drinkability
is
very
good
top
notch
classic
overall
overall
the
beer
was
a
good
porter
the
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
works
very
well
i
would
recommend
any
beer
drinker
try
this
one
drinkability
is
superior
nice
long
flavor
and
the
alcohol
content
doesnt
seem
overly
strong
but
i
can
see
tanking
and
basking
in
a
few
bottles
of
this
stuff
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
its
something
youll
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
probably
shouldnt
its
quite
filling
and
the
abv
will
get
you
if
youre
not
careful
d
for
what
its
worth
id
drink
these
all
night
long
its
pretty
tasty
and
the
price
tag
aint
bad
either
d
this
beer
is
definitely
a
great
drinkers
beer
it
is
a
porter
with
medium
weight
reasonable
taste
and
a
great
balance
of
flavors
however
it
wasnt
what
i
wanted
nor
what
i
expected
after
all
the
hype
i
had
a
founders
porter
right
before
this
one
and
i
must
say
this
was
a
touch
better
aside
from
the
smell
d
actually
struggling
a
bit
with
this
one
finding
the
bitterness
to
be
more
and
more
aggressive
after
each
sip
think
it
could
use
just
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
counter
this
d
considering
this
is
suppose
to
be
the
most
amazing
porter
out
there
was
a
little
disappointed
maybe
had
a
bad
bottle
not
something
you
can
slam
back
share
to
sip
with
good
friends
pours
a
deep
dark
rich
mahogany
with
a
small
brown
head
aroma
of
dark
malts
caramel
coffee
chocolate
dried
fruit
taste
is
same
as
aroma
palate
is
full
bodyvery
nice
smooth
and
creamy
texture
good
carbonation
finish
is
creamy
chocolate
coffee
dark
fruits
and
caramel
a
touch
of
licorice
with
some
light
bitter
hops
to
add
some
balance
overall
a
very
nice
and
smooth
bp
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
big
dark
black
body
of
a
porter
here
on
the
baltic
side
with
some
slimy
oily
looking
liquid
condensing
into
a
dark
elixir
head
is
nice
medium
tan
hits
of
mocha
sheets
of
lace
spraypaint
like
a
looker
takes
a
while
for
the
nose
to
come
out
and
what
comes
out
is
roast
dark
malt
old
world
porter
cocco
licorice
dark
fruit
nice
and
different
actually
taste
takes
a
step
down
imho
but
still
tasty
and
baltic
the
main
taste
is
roast
malt
cocco
maybe
a
little
coffee
the
dark
fruit
kinda
gets
in
the
way
kinda
muting
the
bit
of
vanilla
thats
in
the
tail
end
i
woulda
rather
had
that
interesting
beer
here
feel
is
medium
could
use
a
boost
be
a
bit
thicker
but
still
a
oily
slick
porter
with
faint
bitterness
a
small
prick
to
the
tounge
while
i
would
not
drink
this
to
excess
i
will
gladly
grab
one
of
these
every
winter
for
a
warmer
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
have
come
to
expect
or
like
in
a
baltic
porter
and
maybe
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
would
like
its
full
and
robust
and
drinks
much
lighter
than
a
beer
with
an
abv
of
7
2
its
a
wonderful
example
of
the
baltic
porter
style
and
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
drinking
again
and
again
d
the
only
real
negative
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
and
feels
like
a
larger
than
7
2
beer
intensely
complex
certainly
a
sipper
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
at
7
2
abv
it
commands
respect
d
a
little
less
fruit
and
this
could
be
an
allnighter
not
an
elite
example
of
the
style
especially
because
it
straddles
the
line
between
baltic
porter
and
robust
porter
this
is
plenty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
were
it
cheaper
and
available
in
six
packs
id
consider
buying
it
again
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
love
porters
this
is
just
an
awesome
porter
and
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
long
awaited
bottle
pour
is
like
a
good
porter
with
a
pretty
decent
head
but
not
as
massive
hits
like
a
american
but
with
the
baltic
sour
zest
nose
of
molasses
and
earth
coffee
grounds
and
chocolate
palate
is
a
blend
of
that
with
sour
finish
and
a
bitter
lingering
quality
of
caramelized
onions
there
is
some
stale
porter
fruit
if
grape
and
plum
and
a
blood
earth
quality
fantastic
aspect
of
everything
that
a
baltic
can
do
hits
all
the
notes
nicely
this
is
one
of
the
classic
porters
and
it
lives
up
to
expectations
lighter
bodied
also
than
i
would
have
expected
still
mid
bodied
and
no
alcohol
present
drinkability
is
only
hurt
by
the
carboard
had
this
some
time
ago
and
remember
it
more
fondly
but
have
had
many
better
examples
since
apparently
still
not
bad
and
worth
trying
this
bottle
could
be
bit
old
but
that
should
help
not
hurt
they
were
sold
out
of
my
first
choice
but
this
is
a
pretty
nice
runnerup
it
pours
a
straight
black
topped
by
about
a
fingerandahalf
of
darkish
tan
foam
pretty
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
both
dark
and
milk
baby
roasted
malts
light
smoke
maple
syrup
molasses
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
spruce
tips
the
taste
is
very
similar
heavy
on
the
roast
molasses
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
some
burnt
biscuits
are
added
along
with
some
more
though
still
pretty
light
smoke
this
is
some
damn
tasty
baltic
porter
i
tell
you
what
the
body
is
a
heavy
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
one
that
i
plan
on
revisiting
rather
often
drinkability
one
is
plenty
but
thats
not
unusual
for
porters
pretty
good
brew
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
representation
of
a
baltic
porter
drinkability
picked
this
up
on
recommendation
from
the
manager
at
my
favorite
bottle
shop
as
i
took
the
last
ølfabrikken
from
the
shelf
doesnt
quite
compar
but
still
a
delicious
beer
i
may
have
again
pretty
decent
stuff
here
nothing
amazing
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
this
stuff
went
down
pretty
easy
drinkability
is
very
good
this
was
an
awesome
random
pick
at
the
random
liqour
store
pours
a
two
finger
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
light
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
black
color
no
highlights
some
yeast
left
in
bottle
nose
is
molasses
flavor
is
chewy
molasses
nice
porter
less
chocolate
and
more
molasses
than
8
years
ago
4
45
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
lots
of
dark
fruits
raisins
milk
chocolate
a
hint
of
roast
touch
of
coffee
quite
sweet
light
roast
and
its
subdued
by
the
fruits
and
milky
sweetness
hint
of
something
cardboardish
perhaps
a
little
oxidized
some
smoke
as
the
beer
warms
which
adds
a
nice
layer
warming
alcohol
slightly
thinnish
mouthfeel
for
the
style
cant
say
i
loved
this
one
but
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
just
not
in
my
top
tier
for
the
style
nice
stuff
and
deserving
of
its
place
on
the
baltic
porter
top
10
though
id
take
trois
mousqueatires
version
over
this
in
a
heartbeat
kept
drinking
this
with
dinner
beer
warmed
up
spicy
dinner
sweetness
came
out
and
it
is
a
very
tasty
brew
can
even
drink
another
now
loved
this
beer
since
i
first
had
it
though
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
or
paying
98
for
a
case
on
my
pageboys
wages
still
i
do
feel
kind
of
noble
drinking
this
dtheres
a
lingering
dry
almost
astringent
bitter
thing
going
on
in
the
finish
that
makes
this
one
a
little
hard
to
drink
for
me
definitely
an
interesting
version
of
the
style
that
gets
the
job
done
refreshing
worth
a
try
d
light
feel
for
a
porter
but
doesnt
lack
in
flavor
less
filling
than
most
porters
not
bad
could
probably
have
a
couple
of
these
in
1
night
a
very
robust
and
satisfying
brew
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
a
great
example
of
a
full
bodied
smokey
porter
i
cant
say
ive
had
too
many
baltic
porters
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
ive
quaffed
tastes
of
the
finest
indonesian
coffee
ring
through
sulawesi
comes
to
mind
with
a
very
nice
hop
presence
i
taste
a
lot
of
burnt
butter
and
molasses
this
beer
reminds
me
of
myers
dark
rum
baking
cocoa
maltiness
is
very
nice
and
leads
the
way
on
the
palate
raisin
juice
fruitiness
mixes
with
the
chocolate
for
a
surprisingly
smooth
experience
abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
the
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
fruitiness
and
the
thinner
body
makes
this
decidedly
fall
into
the
baltic
porter
category
as
opposed
to
a
stout
but
shares
many
of
the
same
flavor
components
very
delicious
brew
and
goes
well
with
roasted
pecans
make
sure
to
drink
this
beer
at
least
at
50
degrees
if
not
warmer
it
really
opens
up
nicely
i
will
be
sure
to
try
and
score
some
more
of
this
next
time
i
am
in
louisiana
i
am
sad
i
only
bought
two
bottles
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
classic
baltic
porter
loving
the
sweet
and
pleasant
flavors
with
the
slight
roastiness
of
an
englishamerican
porter
pours
nearly
opaque
black
with
brown
head
nose
has
some
dark
chocolate
and
dark
rum
aromas
on
the
palate
the
roasty
flavors
dominate
with
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
with
chocolate
and
coffee
finish
is
full
of
coffee
flavors
alcohol
is
tame
on
the
palate
even
though
it
has
a
high
abv
drinkability
quite
high
for
such
a
dark
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
of
these
in
one
longish
sitting
careful
with
this
one
as
the
alcohol
is
quiet
after
that
initial
hit
easy
drinking
i
think
bb
still
has
a
1999
bottle
in
their
cellar
a
good
beer
at
a
pretty
good
price
too
pours
a
smooth
deep
black
with
a
few
finger
of
mocha
colored
head
that
dissolves
into
a
nice
heavy
ring
around
the
glass
that
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
has
lots
of
roasted
malts
with
some
bitter
chocolate
and
some
hints
of
toast
chocolate
malt
and
bread
are
at
the
forefront
of
flavors
followed
by
roast
and
a
smooth
sweet
finish
its
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
and
comes
across
slick
and
oily
fantastic
porter
really
enjoyed
the
toasty
character
that
came
out
behind
all
the
roast
and
chocolate
also
really
enjoyed
the
low
carbonation
that
allowed
for
the
flavors
to
be
showcased
and
meld
together
d
even
with
the
mild
overcarbonation
its
still
quite
easy
to
drink
it
definitely
feels
like
a
winter
brew
so
its
appropriate
im
having
this
one
on
a
cold
january
night
the
residual
bitterness
is
restrained
and
the
alcohol
is
not
overtly
obvious
overall
i
still
like
this
beer
but
think
its
much
better
in
bottle
than
on
draft
one
of
the
best
overall
beers
ive
ever
had
and
is
my
personal
benchmark
for
the
baltic
porter
style
now
i
am
drinking
it
from
a
duvel
tulip
the
starch
is
still
annoying
in
the
nose
but
these
bottles
i
have
now
are
much
better
tasting
the
first
bottles
i
had
were
from
a
different
store
though
they
share
the
same
5
year
expired
freshness
date
the
starch
came
out
big
time
in
the
flavor
of
the
previous
perhaps
oxidized
beer
no
more
the
flavors
meld
well
this
beer
is
complex
and
has
aged
well
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
had
both
sides
of
the
spectrum
to
compare
this
was
a
good
porter
drinkable
for
such
a
huge
malt
character
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
not
super
impressed
but
this
was
a
damn
solid
porter
good
across
the
board
overall
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
dark
as
night
porter
very
complex
righ
and
quaffable
brew
will
definitely
snag
a
few
of
these
for
the
cellar
for
the
fall
winter
would
pair
nice
with
anything
chocolate
desserts
creamy
pasta
sauces
bourbon
lamb
or
other
rich
meats
very
dark
color
not
quite
completely
black
with
one
inch
of
mocha
head
the
head
does
not
last
as
long
as
i
would
of
liked
and
it
settles
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
neither
the
aroma
or
flavor
are
as
great
as
a
couple
of
other
baltic
porters
but
this
beer
is
still
lovely
complex
and
dynamic
great
malt
aroma
and
flavor
runs
deep
into
the
drinking
experience
notes
of
espresso
cocoa
and
smoke
hop
bitterness
seems
much
higher
than
others
within
the
style
alcohol
is
well
disguised
and
not
detected
the
body
is
not
as
robust
as
i
would
of
liked
but
has
a
nice
soft
texture
another
of
the
great
baltic
porters
there
is
a
definate
dividing
line
between
the
few
greats
and
the
rest
of
the
pretenders
pours
a
near
black
color
with
brown
highlights
towards
the
edges
big
dense
rocky
head
that
left
a
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
oxidized
red
grapes
similar
to
an
old
ale
some
honey
and
raisin
round
out
the
aroma
the
taste
is
of
a
milk
chocolate
malt
with
oxidized
grapes
cherries
and
a
tart
lemon
twang
me
must
thinks
that
this
is
a
bit
aged
the
roasted
malt
bitterness
stays
true
throughout
this
beer
the
feel
is
thick
and
chewy
like
a
stout
soft
carbonation
finishes
with
a
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
a
sour
lemon
twang
a
very
thick
and
robust
baltic
porter
right
on
style
there
are
some
oxidized
notes
that
add
a
port
wine
and
lemon
character
though
it
might
be
old
this
has
some
nice
flavors
and
a
big
feel
d
a
very
unique
brew
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
again
though
i
might
be
persuaded
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
pretty
big
for
a
porter
but
i
suppose
that
is
the
whole
point
of
this
style
interesting
and
worth
a
try
d
this
is
my
first
time
trying
a
baltic
porter
and
i
must
say
i
am
impressed
this
is
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
the
complexity
of
the
beverage
in
both
taste
and
nose
really
make
it
shine
full
bodied
beer
but
a
thin
flavor
some
roast
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
some
coffee
like
flavors
despite
the
smell
i
would
not
describe
the
flavor
of
this
beer
as
sweet
at
all
in
fact
its
a
little
dry
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
moderate
the
foam
was
dark
wheat
in
color
with
a
reddish
hue
thick
and
smooth
the
color
was
very
opaquebrown
with
cola
red
highlights
in
the
light
the
taste
had
a
deep
rich
taste
of
roasted
barley
coffee
and
caramel
highlights
drinkability
good
if
you
like
richfullbodied
beer
mouthfeel
fullbodied
and
rich
d
this
thing
is
definitely
a
treat
a
very
bold
and
deeply
complex
flavor
and
an
aroma
like
heaven
i
would
happily
drink
two
or
three
of
these
without
getting
remotely
bored
of
this
taste
definitely
a
full
fourdimensional
porter
worth
exploring
the
taste
will
not
disappoint
the
beer
has
a
very
strong
cherry
dark
chocolatey
taste
tons
of
dark
malts
lots
of
roasted
and
charred
flavors
a
bit
of
molasses
and
brown
sugar
a
touch
burnt
this
is
a
nice
baltic
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
on
the
tongue
but
there
is
a
nice
aftertaste
the
beer
is
7
2
abv
but
this
is
well
hidden
and
there
is
no
boozy
or
throaty
feel
to
the
beer
with
this
level
of
abv
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
winter
months
lchaim
the
taste
is
also
light
with
the
same
flavors
you
get
in
the
aroma
shing
through
there
is
a
nice
chocolate
finish
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
gives
it
a
nice
heavy
feel
overall
high
quality
and
an
immediate
favorite
of
mine
try
stuffing
a
few
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
for
a
few
years
pours
deep
black
with
a
small
but
pretty
tan
almost
brown
head
and
little
lacing
lines
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
nuts
coffee
and
hints
of
sweet
bourbon
nose
is
quite
nice
taste
is
smooth
and
great
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
hints
of
raisins
make
up
the
quaff
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
carbonation
drinkability
is
fairly
high
pretty
good
for
this
style
notes
may
have
tasted
it
too
warm
61
9
degrees
nice
for
laying
down
seven
years
this
review
is
for
a
1996
vintage
tasted
in
2003
awesome
example
of
the
style
and
well
deserving
of
the
high
rating
probably
the
second
best
baltic
ive
had
behind
foothills
limited
offering
though
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
that
one
oh
well
chaulk
that
up
to
one
bad
beer
d
very
complex
and
layered
easy
on
the
palette
and
good
going
down
rich
in
flavor
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
damn
good
porter
and
worth
every
sip
i
feel
as
if
this
is
a
must
try
d
very
easy
to
put
down
a
must
for
fans
of
strong
dark
beers
the
beer
pours
a
blackish
brown
color
with
ok
head
retention
and
lacing
as
expected
on
the
nose
i
get
a
lot
of
coffee
chocolate
and
vanilla
still
this
porter
smells
pretty
good
fortunately
good
as
it
smells
this
beer
is
much
more
impressive
on
the
palate
i
get
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
and
cherry
as
well
as
a
hint
of
licorice
as
well
theres
even
a
slight
hint
of
tartness
to
this
beer
that
i
think
works
very
well
in
countering
this
beers
moderate
at
most
sweetness
the
beer
is
fairly
long
and
smooth
and
i
get
something
of
a
dry
almost
leathery
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
the
alcohol
well
disgused
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
then
one
of
these
but
nevertheless
this
was
an
all
together
pretty
enjoyable
porter
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
listed
as
sinebrychoff
porter
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
sour
and
peaty
kind
of
weird
flavor
is
very
medicinal
with
sweet
roasted
malt
this
was
pretty
bad
my
opinion
seems
very
different
from
othersbad
keg
final
thoughts
pretty
tasty
and
very
stout
like
creamy
and
frothy
and
lots
of
chalky
dark
chocolate
and
touch
of
fruits
pretty
good
tasting
and
drinkable
can
measure
up
to
many
of
the
good
porterstouts
but
not
the
best
d
this
is
a
remarkably
drinkable
beer
it
combines
a
palatecleansing
dryness
with
a
pleasant
roasted
flavor
that
keeps
you
sipping
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
hope
the
pour
house
gets
this
on
tap
more
often
overall
a
great
baltic
porter
from
finland
i
find
myself
wishing
for
more
of
this
style
from
our
american
craft
brewers
d
very
nice
beer
big
bold
flavors
disguise
the
alcohol
in
the
beverage
while
i
sampled
this
in
the
summer
it
would
surely
be
more
appropriate
as
a
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
delicious
and
very
drinkable
i
would
gladly
drink
34
of
these
through
the
course
of
the
night
overall
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
appearance
are
all
pluses
for
me
the
aroma
is
a
bit
less
impressive
as
it
betrays
the
7
abv
a
bit
and
is
less
grainy
than
i
had
hoped
the
beer
pours
well
and
is
quite
attractive
compared
to
many
other
porters
i
have
sampled
with
generous
amounts
of
lace
ringing
the
glass
drinkability
is
probably
not
quite
as
good
as
some
other
traditional
baltic
porters
which
i
understand
are
generally
lighter
in
body
and
sometimes
in
alcohol
content
as
well
but
for
a
single
serving
this
is
quite
a
brew
i
like
this
one
its
not
cheap
for
a
33cl
bottle
but
its
an
excellent
treat
on
a
rainy
day
highly
recommended
m
d
medium
bodied
a
touch
on
the
heavier
side
it
supports
the
flavour
well
and
thats
a
plus
considering
the
abv
it
goes
down
amazingly
smooth
and
easy
a
good
representation
of
style
and
worth
looking
into
overall
a
great
baltic
porter
a
style
which
i
really
appreciate
and
this
one
is
well
near
the
top
of
my
rankings
for
baltic
porters
drinkability
highly
drinkable
because
of
the
low
alcohol
and
complexity
of
flavors
quite
a
unique
taste
reminds
me
of
melted
dark
chocolate
bars
with
somewhat
offputting
flavors
of
sour
milk
and
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
mediumbodied
and
chalkytoo
chalky
and
dry
for
my
liking
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
try
but
not
a
phenomenal
baltic
porter
by
any
means
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
how
it
compares
though
immediate
smell
is
of
average
intensity
crushed
grapes
and
a
strong
woody
tone
tastes
of
molasses
lightly
of
wood
chips
chestnuts
very
nutty
porter
this
beer
has
a
somewhat
smooth
stoutfeel
on
the
mouth
it
thinly
coats
the
palate
with
chocolate
and
wood
this
beer
was
pretty
good
though
unfortunately
the
feel
and
the
taste
stick
around
forever
what
a
great
porter
this
is
a
model
by
which
others
are
judged
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
considerable
lacing
of
the
glass
there
is
a
mild
coffee
aroma
taste
is
mild
with
hints
of
coffee
finishes
slightly
bitter
medium
bodied
and
a
tad
bitter
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
stomach
for
continuos
drinking
overall
a
soso
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
i
thought
flying
dog
gonzo
was
fantastic
but
this
one
is
giving
it
a
run
for
its
money
d
great
representation
of
this
style
definitely
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
cold
weather
andor
some
meat
d
great
beer
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
bitterness
but
overall
very
tasty
hv
d
this
is
a
drinkable
not
too
heavy
baltic
porter
a
well
done
beer
d
would
burn
out
after
1
or
two
this
is
delicious
and
would
be
great
for
a
crisp
evening
such
a
solid
porter
d
super
easy
to
drink
ill
be
sure
to
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
come
across
it
d
im
sorry
i
didnt
think
to
try
this
one
sooner
very
cheap
and
quite
good
a
little
strong
to
session
but
certainly
not
over
the
top
abv
wise
for
the
style
something
ill
check
out
again
you
should
too
the
beer
was
very
smooth
but
with
a
thick
body
but
not
to
much
so
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
good
porter
this
beers
greatness
is
hard
to
describe
many
subtle
notes
that
are
hard
to
qualify
it
manages
to
be
both
refreshing
and
nourishing
if
you
see
a
bottle
on
the
shelf
grab
it
and
youll
know
what
i
mean
i
hope
dabsolutely
a
satisfying
refresher
going
down
too
quickly
for
comfort
drinkability
the
bitterness
screwed
my
head
a
little
not
use
to
that
on
a
porter
not
that
bad
was
pretty
good
pitch
black
with
a
thing
light
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
rim
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
burnt
malts
and
molasses
the
malts
are
roasty
they
go
with
some
dark
fruit
and
some
slight
spiciness
the
bitterness
from
the
malts
lingers
for
a
bit
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
full
bodied
d
wonderfully
drinkable
baltic
porter
some
unexpected
complexities
in
the
nose
taste
and
the
alcohol
while
well
hidden
does
hit
eventually
yet
id
be
happy
to
drink
more
of
all
the
authentic
baltic
porters
those
from
the
baltic
region
that
ive
had
i
definitely
like
this
one
the
most
its
very
drinkable
yet
complex
and
absolutely
well
balanced
and
delicious
on
tap
at
pepperland
cafe
the
beer
was
an
opaque
black
with
a
thick
milk
chocolate
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
mostly
coffee
aroma
but
there
was
also
some
sweet
dark
fruit
tasted
primarily
of
espresso
but
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
was
nicely
balanced
by
the
dark
fruit
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
particular
bottle
seemed
slightly
stale
or
oxidized
not
sure
how
long
it
had
been
sitting
around
before
buying
it
could
be
heavier
carbonation
is
good
definately
a
bit
too
thin
drinkability
is
very
high
d
strong
flavors
come
together
to
create
a
awesome
beer
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
will
be
drinking
it
often
from
now
on
very
refreshing
of
course
easy
to
sink
conclusion
the
flavors
have
an
ever
so
slightly
muted
feel
to
them
like
this
beers
sat
around
a
bit
too
long
and
its
still
fantastic
at
like
2
39
a
bottle
im
gonna
go
buy
out
the
last
10
or
so
of
these
from
the
store
wonderful
baltic
porter
d
just
a
great
beer
allaround
glad
i
finally
found
this
in
carlsbad
a
shame
i
wont
be
able
to
buy
it
more
often
i
can
certainly
see
why
it
was
in
the
top
100
for
a
while
this
is
one
of
the
better
porters
out
there
in
my
opinion
if
youre
a
fan
of
beers
like
the
abyss
i
think
youll
really
enjoy
this
brew
i
usually
dont
reach
for
this
style
brew
but
id
certainly
have
this
one
again
well
done
by
our
friends
in
finland
overall
i
liked
the
beer
a
bit
to
strong
in
abv
and
flavor
to
drink
more
then
one
at
a
time
but
that
one
is
enjoyable
may
have
just
been
the
bottle
but
poured
a
huge
dense
1
head
but
quickly
faded
leaving
a
thin
but
still
dense
layer
on
top
of
deep
dark
brown
and
once
again
dense
looking
beer
incredible
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
not
an
overwhelmingly
strong
smell
there
a
smoked
scent
with
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
or
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
mix
roasted
malts
and
that
chocolatecoffee
from
the
scent
it
has
an
initial
bite
of
bitterness
up
front
that
fades
fast
no
strong
carbonization
so
rests
low
and
dense
in
your
mouth
certainly
masks
the
abv
well
as
it
goes
down
like
many
weaker
abv
porters
overall
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
that
does
everything
right
without
overdoing
anything
be
sure
to
give
this
one
a
try
pours
a
beautiful
black
with
a
large
brown
head
that
stays
upand
becomes
craggy
like
the
foam
on
a
milkshake
leaves
nice
looking
rings
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
rich
aromas
of
cocoa
express
and
burnt
malts
very
enticing
appearance
and
smell
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
lots
of
milk
chocolate
and
bit
of
a
charred
roasty
bitterness
disappointingly
thin
body
this
quality
ultimately
makes
it
easier
drink
a
topnotch
beer
aroma
is
strong
and
smoky
with
a
salty
undertone
like
fine
coffee
mixed
with
miso
it
pours
black
as
motor
oil
with
a
thick
dark
ecru
head
that
is
finebubbled
but
doesnt
stick
around
flavor
is
like
smoky
coffee
with
nutty
and
unsweetened
chocolate
hints
and
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
texture
is
smooth
and
tingly
and
just
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
not
too
shabby
d
the
sourness
keeps
the
drinkability
score
down
maybe
my
palette
just
isnt
refined
enough
to
enjoy
that
aspect
a
very
interesting
brew
for
sure
the
smell
and
taste
differ
somewhat
im
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
try
very
smooth
and
creamy
brew
im
tasting
some
roasted
characteristics
some
definitive
chocolate
with
a
pumpernickel
bready
finish
very
fine
tasting
beer
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
recommend
opaque
black
under
a
thick
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
into
a
lumpy
creamy
milkshakelike
topping
webby
stringy
lace
all
over
the
glass
aromas
of
deep
dark
malty
goodness
sweet
chocolate
cake
fruity
alcohol
esters
light
roastiness
and
a
faint
hint
of
smoke
black
roasted
malt
and
rich
sweetness
in
the
flavor
dark
fruits
but
the
roastiness
dominates
and
lingers
some
alcohol
but
the
sheer
amount
of
deliciousness
covers
it
up
with
ease
full
slick
mouthfeel
modestly
bitter
and
dry
fucking
awesome
i
want
more
d
almost
a
perfect
beer
almost
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
it
my
first
finish
beer
hopefully
not
my
last
dang
i
really
like
this
beer
again
much
better
as
it
warms
great
thanks
again
greg
pours
a
very
dark
black
with
foamy
coffee
colored
head
beautiful
aroma
of
smoky
maltiness
chocolate
nut
and
toast
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
lots
of
smoky
malty
flavor
hints
of
chocolate
toast
nut
and
roasted
coffee
the
taste
is
rich
complex
yet
smooth
and
clean
with
great
balance
of
flavours
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
has
complex
tastes
of
leaves
chocolate
dark
toasted
brown
bread
prunes
a
hint
of
port
some
raisin
black
pepper
esp
in
the
finish
with
an
increasing
taste
of
black
coffee
condensed
with
brown
sugar
that
is
stronger
by
the
end
it
is
rather
dry
throughout
for
the
most
part
in
the
middle
it
has
a
definite
but
light
sweetness
and
light
but
slightly
stronger
bitterness
right
at
the
finish
but
for
most
of
the
time
up
front
and
in
the
final
finish
and
aftertaste
it
is
mostly
dry
clean
and
leafy
the
flavours
are
fairly
strong
but
nicely
restrained
and
harmonious
excellent
flavor
and
balance
too
bad
i
only
picked
up
a
single
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
damn
fine
baltic
porter
that
really
hits
the
spot
just
a
solid
offering
that
i
will
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
now
worth
checking
out
for
sure
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
on
a
frigid
midnovember
day
it
warmed
me
up
to
say
the
least
and
most
certainly
put
me
in
a
good
mood
if
you
can
find
it
findlay
oh
is
where
she
got
it
you
really
should
try
this
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
figs
akin
to
a
belgian
triple
are
tucked
in
there
but
it
is
the
malts
that
do
the
talking
a
tad
simplistic
at
times
complex
at
others
a
damn
good
beer
especially
from
the
fins
and
only
the
high
abv
prevents
me
from
continually
downing
this
bottle
thanks
to
santa
pours
a
pure
black
body
with
a
medium
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
a
boozy
combination
of
dark
fruit
and
espresso
the
taste
is
very
nice
tons
of
sweet
fruits
blackberries
mostly
some
coffee
and
chcolates
and
a
dry
and
toasted
malt
finish
a
very
nice
porter
for
sure
i
could
live
in
finland
just
to
drink
these
plus
all
those
hot
finnish
girls
drinkability
is
ok
i
have
to
say
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
for
sure
especially
once
i
saw
how
highly
rated
it
was
i
prefer
my
baltics
richer
sweeter
and
with
more
depth
and
smoothness
this
one
is
all
about
the
dry
boozy
roast
wasnt
to
bad
to
drink
either
but
will
most
likely
just
be
the
one
time
purchase
body
is
not
too
thick
and
slightly
oily
quite
appropriate
for
the
style
this
is
certainly
a
slowdrinking
ale
but
still
goes
down
pretty
easily
all
things
considered
on
the
whole
a
tasty
dark
ale
that
is
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
not
the
greatest
porter
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
a
good
one
i
would
have
no
qualms
about
drinking
more
of
this
drinkability
what
a
great
dry
roasted
baltic
porter
its
too
bad
that
it
doesnt
come
in
a
bigger
bottle
this
small
bottle
wont
last
long
and
i
guess
neither
would
a
big
bottle
of
this
fine
brew
either
you
might
think
it
might
be
another
expensive
european
beer
but
its
really
not
i
could
see
myself
buying
another
bottle
or
two
to
enjoy
again
in
the
near
future
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
that
borders
on
black
with
almost
2
fingers
of
persistent
mocha
colored
head
excellent
aroma
big
and
malty
some
sweetness
some
cocoa
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
lots
of
darker
fruits
prunes
plums
a
bit
portlike
taste
is
excellent
there
is
a
big
malty
sweetness
upfront
that
never
totally
goes
away
but
is
overtaken
by
over
flavors
rather
quickly
there
is
a
prominent
roasted
character
here
that
is
quite
like
schwarzbier
not
like
a
stout
but
more
pronounced
than
the
of
variants
of
porter
the
dark
fruits
are
again
present
and
play
a
more
prominent
role
than
in
the
aroma
the
like
cocoa
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
take
a
backseat
here
very
clean
lowmedium
hop
bitterness
just
enough
to
balance
this
out
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
mediumfull
body
with
moderateish
carbonation
and
next
to
no
discernible
alcohol
presence
drinakbility
is
excellent
complex
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
the
flavors
dont
linger
unpleasantly
leaving
me
wanting
more
sinebrychoff
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
an
monster
of
a
chocolate
milky
brown
head
that
leaves
thick
lacing
very
impressive
big
nose
of
chocolatey
coffee
goodness
roasty
and
semi
sweet
overall
with
subtle
notes
of
bourbon
full
and
quite
chewy
in
initial
body
but
becomes
surprisingly
thin
after
a
few
sips
hops
explode
just
before
the
finish
cakey
with
yeasty
notes
of
pepper
and
brown
sugar
but
it
leaves
the
tongue
craving
another
quaff
very
coating
with
a
sweet
toasty
aftertaste
no
alcohol
heat
incredible
beer
definitely
a
winner
if
spotted
pretty
good
baltic
porter
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
worth
a
try
this
sucker
is
pretty
damn
black
virtually
opaque
with
a
light
brown
foamy
head
that
then
turns
rocky
after
a
minute
then
compresses
down
to
pancake
batter
the
aroma
is
carob
and
chicory
with
bits
of
chocolate
coffee
and
boozy
stewed
dried
dark
fruit
im
going
to
say
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
a
metallic
edge
that
at
first
seems
wrong
but
quickly
gets
right
there
is
a
dry
scorched
grain
character
that
plays
well
with
the
warm
alcohol
sensation
and
full
body
too
bad
its
not
3040
degrees
colder
outside
right
now
not
that
i
want
it
to
be
but
this
beer
would
be
great
to
have
around
in
february
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
not
quite
opaque
but
i
dont
believe
its
supposed
to
be
coffee
with
cream
colored
head
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
very
nice
lace
nose
and
taste
exhibit
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
fruit
silky
mouthfeel
with
near
perfect
carbonation
and
a
nice
finish
too
easy
to
drink
im
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
buy
this
one
as
often
as
i
can
while
its
around
fantastic
real
nice
porter
im
keepin
a
few
for
desert
pours
out
black
no
light
penetrates
the
edges
of
the
beer
fluffy
creamy
looking
head
with
some
big
bubbles
mixed
in
hugely
aromatic
with
fruitiness
maltiness
and
slight
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
and
this
character
is
unusual
as
it
starts
late
this
porter
has
a
big
bouquet
upfront
and
the
taste
starts
light
then
comes
the
sweet
and
fruity
hops
break
late
like
a
crashing
wave
to
help
dry
out
the
finish
which
is
still
on
the
sweet
side
hops
and
roast
linger
in
the
aftertaste
nice
little
baltic
porter
d

is
very
well
hidden
this
is
an
absolute
treat
i
really
look
forward
to
having
this
many
times
again
d
best
part
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
just
like
the
celebrator
dark
but
not
super
heavy
and
very
easy
to
drink
no
matter
what
time
of
year
overall
a
great
beer
fantastic
with
smoked
pork
chops
well
worth
the
effort
to
find
and
enjoy
this
beer
a
must
try
hit
for
the
style
d
quite
nice
this
beer
goes
down
real
easy
great
beer
i
enjoyed
this
wine
specialist3
25330ml
a
modest
sweetness
sits
up
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
grows
as
it
warms
which
really
provides
a
good
base
for
the
other
notes
to
rest
on
and
doesnt
dominate
espresso
bittersweet
chocolate
and
more
dark
roasted
malts
are
predominant
there
are
some
little
flicks
of
dark
fruits
in
here
as
well
below
that
is
a
very
slightly
astringent
oak
right
prior
to
the
finish
very
complex
but
just
plain
balanced
all
along
the
way
the
finish
is
ever
so
sweet
but
transitions
to
an
unexpected
hop
bitterness
note
that
i
didnt
catch
at
first
all
of
which
lingers
just
enough
good
strong
willed
carbonation
props
up
a
slightly
lighter
mouthfeel
great
stuff
very
drinkable
slow
and
easy
sipper
i
wish
i
had
a
maduro
cigar
the
smooth
creaminess
coupled
with
excellent
carbonation
make
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
d
very
good
a
huge
bitter
roasted
porter
with
an
equally
big
grainy
coffee
lacing
one
should
be
enough
to
fill
you
up
and
leave
you

porter
mouthfeel
could
be
thicker
thats
my
only
complaint
a
nice
and
sippable
porter
with
a
nice
complexity
dangerously
drinkable
recommended
big
thanks
to
deepsouth
for
sending
me
a
bottle
of
this
in
powerball
served
in
a
nonic
wise
choice
poured
a
deep
opaque
black
rocky
cascading
mochacolored
head
was
barely
contained
in
the
glass
good
retention
with
dense
rings
of
lacing
left
behind
as
the
head
slowly
receded
scents
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
flavors
similar
to
nose
with
a
pleasant
roasty
character
and
a
slight
hops
bitterness
that
lingers
at
the
end
surprisingly
flat
feeling
in
the
mouth
considering
the
generous
head
however
nice
mediumbodied
feel
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
all
and
all
a
nice
alternative
to
an
ris
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
more
drinkable
with
not
so
big
a
flavor
profile
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
this
is
a
very
good
porter
it
definitely
leans
more
towards
the
complexity
of
the
ris
but
without
that
stomach
walloping
alcohol
or
gravity
content
notes
id
drink
this
again
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
certainly
one
that
i
would
choose
over
any
other
porter
and
over
nearly
any
stout
as
well
outstanding
drinkability
is
good
but
this
rich
flavor
and
the
7
2
abv
would
become
strong
perhaps
quickly
d
good
but
i
found
it
too
roasty
and
bitter
for
a
session
beer
thick
syrupy
appearance
with
a
dark
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
heavy
alcohol
on
the
nose
dark
chocolate
coffee
some
fruity
undertones
i
think
i
can
smell
some
hops
as
well
but
there
covered
up
by
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
dark
chocolate
and
bitterness
in
the
taste
coffee
as
well
not
as
complex
as
i
remembered
it
or
as
complex
as
the
nose
a
tasty
classic
though
a
precursor
to
the
ris
phenom
i
thought
this
was
well
balanced
and
was
quite
impressed
black
pour
with
a
quickly
fading
bubbly
fizzy
brown
head
smell
is
a
touch
of
soy
molasses
some
figgyness
and
heavily
of
peat
much
like
a
scotch
ale
nice
medium
body
that
isnt
too
thin
or
thick
with
a
slight
worcestershire
tastes
dull
fig
flavor
as
well
and
tastes
too
much
like
a
peaty
mcewans
scotch
ale
or
traquair

me
nicely
made

but
the
flavors
just
arent
for

after

the
taste
is
full
of
roasted

and
bitter

with

overall
this
is
good
porter
recommended
notes
best
before
date
is
obliterated
not
sure
how
old
this
is
i
just
bought
it
at
olivers
in
albany
but
the
label
was
pretty
scuffed
up
so
i
wonder
if
its
been
sitting
around
for
awhile
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
ive
only
had
a
few
of
this
style
but
i
think
this
one
will
be
hard
to
top
thanks
again
mike
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
somewhat
uncommon
style
that
bears
only
slight
similarity
to
the
other
porter
variants
well
worth
seeking
as
far
as
the
style
very
drinkable
with
a
complex
taste
and
great
feel
the
7
2abv
is
not
overwhelming
and
would
allow
me
to
drink
one
or
two
more
with
ease
i
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
from
this
beer
next
please
this
is
a
good
beer
but
lands
a
little
shy
of
greatness
nice
complexity
here
but
it
lacks
that
magic
that
i
was
expecting
then
again
ive
been
spoiled

this
is
very

very

its

without

if
you
like

youll
probably
love
this
and
that
says
a
lot
for
this
beer
just
think
big
stout
and
less
porter
for
this
offering
saw
this
brew
the
other
day
and
decided
that
i
would
give
it
a
try
not
sure
what
i
was
getting
as
i
have
never
heard
of
the
brewery
before
the
brew
poured
to
a
dark
black
color
with
a
medium
sized
dark
tan
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nice
lots
of
roasted
with
a
slight

also
chocolate
slight
black
liquorish
dark

the
taste
is
quite
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
immediately
come
to
mind
slight
sweet
note
bit
more
of
a
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
some
alcohol
flavors
come
through
but
are
very
welcoming
brew
has
a
slight
astringency
to
the
feel
at
the
end
kind
of
charcoal
like
wow
i
really
stumbled
onto
something
here
this
brew
is
simply
fantastic
and
so
drinkable
this
brew
has
completely
caught
me
off
guard
and
simply
has
to
be
one
of
the
finest
brews
i
have
ever
had
simply
amazing
this
beer
was
such
a
comfort
to
drink
really
an
outstanding
beer
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
nose
is
a
sweet
sugary
malt
with
extremely
faint
roasted
bean
coffee
and
cocoa
qualities
to
it
flavor
is
very
unique
smooth
and
tough
on
the
very
tail
end
i
get
a
strong
almost
tarred
earth
aftertaste
that
lingers
in
my
mouth
but
before
that
comes
i
get
a
strong
silky
smooth
lightly
roasted
porter
feel
is
thick
and
with
good
bubble
it
has
only
been
a
few
minutes
and
i
am
halfway
through
it
extremely
drinkable
an
absolutely
beautiful
brew
taste
is
roasted
and
has
great
malt
bitterness
coffee
cacoa
and
mocca
this
comes
closest
the
malts
offer
a
nice
malt
bitterness
without
being
burned
body
is
slightly
sticky
and
aftertaste
is
dry
and
lingering
roasted
a
damn
good
beer
this
i
suppose
its
my
first
authentic
baltic
porter
being
that
its
from
eastern
europe
and
has
a
name
that
i
cant
pronounce
of
the
few
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
had
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
although
not
quite
as
good
as
the
yearold
gonzo
ive
had
imo
still
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
is
recommended
to
anyone
especially
fans
of
the
style
holy
shit
what
a
porter
i
cant
beleive
it
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
and
i
got
super
lucky
it
pours
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
it
smells
wonderful
even
i
can
smell
the
roasted
malts
in
this
it
tastes
like
a
standard
porter
should
and
then
some
with
a
nice
full
taste
and
a
lingering
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
just
plain
perfect
and
i
could
most
likely
polish
off
a
case
before
i
knew
where
the
beer
went
if
you
like
porter
or
really
any
dark
beer
try
this
you
will
be
very
happy
with
it
d
very
drinkable
beer
taste
is
excellent
smell
is
a
wonderful
experience
and
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
an
all
around
excellent
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
most
definately
plan
on
consuming
again
overall
this
was
very
nice
and
unlike
anything
i
have
had
before
a
very
full
bodied
porter
with
a
decidely
big
flavor
and
a
very
nice
long
lasting
finish
i
really
thought
this
was
great
and
i
am
glad
i
have
another
overall
damn
i
like
a
good
porter
and
this
is
definitely
one
2
of
these
to
finish
the
night
would
be
nice
d
alcohol
is
well
masked
exceptionally
drinkable
a
total
session
beer
its
enjoyable
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
ya
pours
out
black
with
a
big
frothy
chocolaty
head
that
takes
its
time
before
lacing
to
a
thin
layer
looks
spectacular
smells
of
bakers
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
roasty
malt
the
taste
is
crazy
in
a
very
good
way
starts
roasty
then
transitions
into
bakers
chocolate
then
the
dark
fruit
kicks
in
then
washed
away
by
a
hop
bite
that
dissapears
to
a
coffee
but
silky
flavor
so
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
tickle
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
the
way
the
flavor
slinks
through
a
complex
series
of
blended
elements
is
in
a
word
art
it
caresses
and
lulls
but
keeps
you
with
it
along
the
way
the
abv
is
an
afterthought
and
i
dont
care
how
big
or
little
it
is
though
it
is
rather
middleoftheroad
id
gladly
drink
as
many
of
these
as
the
next
morning
could
handle
a
magic
wand
touched
this
one
and
the
incantation
is
all
that
ill
have
to
be
generous
with
my
ratings
as
my
lessthanstellar
pour
screwed
things
up
a
bit
the
head
on
this
thing
was
huge
so
much
so
that
it
overflowed
my
tumbler
had
i
poured
right
the
head
would
be
substantial
fluffy
and
gorgeous
tan
over
an
opaque
black
body
looks
like
a
stout
really
mouthfeel
suffered
as
well
seeming
a
bit
flat
but
ill
chalk
that
up
to
the
agressive
pour
instead
ill
focus
on
the
taste
which
was
chocolatey
and
rich
but
simpler
than
i
expected
from
this
most
hallowed
of
porters
doesnt
approach
the
incredible
deliciousness
of
perkunos
hammer
in
my
memory
but
tasty
nonetheless
finish
was
just
bitter
enough
to
keep
me
sipping
away
nice
poured
into
a
heavy
glass
chalice
forming
a
12
brown
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
fades
slowly
with
plenty
of
slowfalling
lace
aroma
is
dark
grains
and
licorice
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
coffee
grindtype
bitterness
as
well
mouthfeel
oddly
seems
a
bit
watery
but
this
ones
still
plenty
drinkable
not
bad
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
drinkability
this
is
a
really
really
solid
brew
very
approachable
with
great
flavor
body
and
very
easy
drinking
this
brew
is
definitely
deserving
of
its
rating
and
worth
the
3
99
tag
that
is
still
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
bottle
thanks
again
for
tpd975
for
this
wonderful
brewsky
overall
thank
you
himerman
for
this
great
beer
i
really
liked
it
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
reviewed
from
finland
i
was
licky
to
find
this
vintage
1998
gem
at
kahns
in
indy
pours
to
an
old
fet
black
oil
body
with
an
inch
of
chocolate
brown
head
nose
is
a
warm
rich
malty
feel
with
roasty
chocolate
notes
hints
of
toffee
and
maple
are
noticeable
too
as
i
take
first
sip
it
is
as
if
it
had
been
aged
in
oak
as
the
wood
notes
are
very
present
mineral
malty
feel
is
even
and
balanced
7
2
alchol
is
nowhere
in
the
taste
it
is
a
bit
mettalic
in
flavor
in
a
real
old
vintage
kind
of
way
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
balanced
by
a
slight
hop
hint
that
fades
fast
this
is
very
bood
but
maybe
a
bit
past
its
prime
i
would
like
to
try
a
2000
or
so
vintage
to
test
this
theory
this
is
really
a
solid
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
beer
hear
a
lot
about
this
porter
so
i
picked
up
a
single
to
try
this
past
weekend
poured
it
into
a
widemouth
tulip
and
was
impressed
by
the
huge
frothy
head
and
the
chocolate
brown
color
my
first
sip
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
though
it
was
good
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
i
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
same
thing
nice
porter
but
i
guess
i
expected
a
lot
id
buy
one
from
a
store
again
for
a
few
bucks
but
i
am
glad
that
i
didnt
spend
7
or
9
as
ive
seen
on
menus
at
beer
bars
the
beers
finish
is
a
bit
winey
and
bitter
the
tastular
experience
is
quite
different
from
what
my
nose
went
through
lacking
some
of
the
richness
with
which
i
was
first
impressed
d
this
is
deserving
of
its
rating
with
the
exception
of
the
aroma
imho
everything
else
is
great
full
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
on
the
rich
side
for
a
porter
but
its
ohsogood
its
certainly
worth
trying
one
of
the
best
porters
the
world
has
to
offer
drinkability
is
good
easy
drinking
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
will
be
buying
this
one
again
slow
down
and
appreciate
each
sip
drinkability
this
was
a
great
beer
which
i
picked
up
at
martin
wine
cellar
for
1
nobody
liked
it
i
guess
so
they
had
it
on
their
discount
rack
lucky
me
i
picked
up
4
and
used
one
to
cook
with
this
is
a
very
good
porter
even
with
the
alcohol
content
a
little
plus
with
this
outstanding
winter
beer
regardless
all
in
all
a
very
solid
brew
and
one
you
should
certainly
pick
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
because
this
is
a
very
rich
and
thick
brew
the
drinkability
isnt
its
strong
point
but
this
one
delivers
on
the
flavor
complexity
and
appearance
to
kill
with
the
best
of
them
overall
pretty
nice
i
dont
think
its
worth
all
the
hype
though
i
would
happily
take
a
bottle
of
gonzo
or
southampton
imperial
porter
for
the
same
price
or
less
its
a
solid
beer
and
worth
trying
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
drinkability
is
high
here
dispite
the
abv
great
tasting
and
wonderful
aftertaste
make
for
a
great
session
beer
i
need
to
try
this
fresh
but
i
am
very
happy
with
it
as
is
this
beer
poured
thick
and
oily
looking
with
a
huge
rocky
brown
head
the
aroma
is
strong
of
malt
with
some
chocolatecaramel
characteristics
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
some
roasted
and
chocolate
flavors
are
noticeable
along
with
a
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
a
bit
chewy
overall
this
is
a
beer
with
bold
flavors
that
are
well
balanced

making
it
quite
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
sams
for
this
suggestion
chilled
and
poured
out
into
a
nonic
just
under
one
finger
of
creamy
milk
chocolate
head
develops
lacing
is
already
apparent
and
retention
is
decent
body
is
black
and
completely
opaque
first
sniff
is
very
complex
notes
of
figs
anise
raison
dirty
cocoa
subtle
hints
of
roasted
walnuts
maybe
even
coffee
but
very
faint
and
only
in
the
back
end
hops
are
very
subdued
in
the
nose
i
can
detect
them
faintly
but
can
not
detect
which
they
are
for
sure
taste
is
just
as
complex
and
delicious
the
flavor
is
well
shaped
by
bottle
conditioning
which
has
made
wonderful
space
for
many
subtle
nuances
to
become
apparent
roasted
malt
is
more
apparent
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
smell
same
with
the
cocoa
slightly
fruity
at
first
and
then
quickly
taken
over
by
the
roasted
malts
the
subtle
bitterness
manifests
toward
the
early
middle
and
then
again
on
the
finish
the
malt
and
hop
balance
is
very
good
its
obviously
malt
forward
but
the
ibu
was
obviously
not
for
gotten
about
for
me
it
could
it
could
stay
where
it
is
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
taste
it
5
points
back
ward
abv
on
is
makes
it
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
perfect
to
have
two
to
three
during
a
meal
or
just
one
for
a
snack
mouth
feel
is
wonderful
perfect
for
the
style
lots
of
complex
big
flavors
but
not
over
done
in
the
least
this
is
an
excellent
food
beer
as
all
good
porters
should
be
i
just
ate
some
gruyere
with
fig
jam
great
pairing
but
obviously
this
would
be
great
with
barbecue
or
even
spareribs
its
taken
me
a
long
time
to
get
porters
but
now
i
love
them
so
dearly
especially
this
one
thank
the
elfin
lords
it
is
brewed
all
year
round
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
tannish
head
which
then
leaves
some
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
figs
raisins
slight
toffeecoffee
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
very
nice
slightly
sweet
malty
some
dark
fruits
going
on
and
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
one
fine
baltic
porter
highly
recommended
awesome
lovely
baltic
porter
wish
i
could
see
more
of
the
style
preferred
evening
sipper
recommended
on
all
fronts
got
in
a
trade
with
bort11
thanks
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
that
i
let
warm
up
a
bit
into
a
pint
glass
the
bottle
had
no
dating
system
and
since
in
a
trade
dont
know
if
fresh
or
cellared
it
poured
a
deep
black
with
mahogany
fringes
when
against
the
light
it
had
a
good
size
head
that
was
brown
in
color
it
slowly
settled
to
a
collar
with
no
lacing
which
was
surprising
the
aroma
was
roasted
malts
with
dark
chocolate
aroma
as
well
also
had
a
strong
sweet
smell
that
i
couldnt
pin
down
the
taste
was
really
good
and
smooth
since
dont
know
age
of
bottle
not
sure
if
thats
the
way
it
is
or
if
it
has
mellowed
over
time
either
way
its
good
while
i
enjoyed
the
taste
for
me
this
is
a
one
per
session
and
maybe
once
a
year
beer
falls
into
the
category
of
tastes
great
and
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
that
i
can
have
over
and
over
like
my
hefes
wits
and
saisons
with
that
said
still
highly
recommend
4
rboay
t
y
d
a
pleasant
and
masterful
brew
of
wordly
porportions
nuance
that
exemplifies
the
taste
of
baltic
porter
as
a
style
carbonation
supports
the
maltiness
flawlessly
and
allows
elements
of
spice
hops
and
milky
smooth
textures
to
shine
i
have
and
will
continue
to
seek
out
this
magnificent
specimen
one
of
the
premier
porters
of
the
world
i
loved
this
beer
vintage
2000
and
at
7
years
old
it
has
kept
up
incredibly
well
part
of
the
b
united
vintage
portfolio
this
beer
has
a
dark
almost
ruby
red
appearence
and
is
very
smooth
yet
has
the
robust
flavour
you
look
for
in
a
baltic
porter
incredible
malt
tone
i
can
truly
say
this
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
cant
wait
to
try
the
fresh
version
highly
recommend
chris
d
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
especially
for
the
price
i
loved
the
sweet
chocolate
flavor
with
roasted
malts
drinkability
all
in
all
quite
tasty
and
a
top
choice
in
my
book
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
slightly
filling
but
not
enough
that
it
would
prevent
you
from
knocking
a
few
of
them
back
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
good
stick
with
for
a
while
overall
very
different
from
any
porter
ive
had
although
i
havent
had
many
this
beer
is
complex
and
certainly
a
sipper
if
you
like
porters
this
is
a
must
try
a
good
baltic
porter
ive
been
wanting
to
try
for
awhile
now
glad
i
finally
did
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
these
in
the
future
poured
an
opaque
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
diminished
the
aroma
was
of
dark
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
molasses
with
just
a
tinge
of
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
was
very
complex
for
a
porter
there
was
the
usual
dark
malt
and
chocolate
but
an
interesting
bitterness
provided
depth
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
just
not
something
id
drink
that
often
drinkability
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
good
one
of
my
favorite
brews
all
around
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
my
adnams
tulip
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
opaque
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
tan
foam
smells
of
molasses
milk
chocolate
prunes
and
a
hint
of
smoke
and
anise
tastes
of
booze
filled
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
molasses
followed
by
bitter
coffee
and
cocoa
powder
medium
to
full
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
is
a
rich
and
satisfying
beer
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
truely
a
beer
that
you
should
seek
out
pours
extremely
dark
and
rich
with
a
thick
tan
head
faintly
smoky
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
absolutely
delicious
a
very
smooth
and
well
done
beer
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
highly
reccomended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
this
isnt
often
available
here
but
ive
got
several
saved
up
im
going
to
cut
this
review
short
and
go
have
another
imo
you
should
too
if
price
were
no
factor
this
would
be
a
staple
beer
at
approximately
3
per
bottle
though
this
will
have
to
be
an
occasional
treat
perhaps
for
the
best
this
is
to
be
savored
drinkabilitynotes
what
a
fantastic
porter
very
complex
with
an
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
chocolate
cherries
burnt
toast
coffe
just
to
name
a
few
has
a
really
nice
roastiness
in
the
finish
along
with
a
linger
hop
bitterness
definitely
a
beer
to
savor
and
let
warm
up
from
the
fridge
this
beer
really
opened
my
eyes
one
of
the
more
complex
and
delicious
beers
ive
had
recently
highly
recommended
seek
and
enjoy
poured
from
the
bottle
a
slightly
roughed
up
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
black
as
night
and
has
a
twofinger
frothy
browncream
colored
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
malt
and
a
bit
of
smoky
alcohol
the
taste
starts
slightly
sweet
and
transitions
to
a
very
bitter
dry
coffee
finish
this
bottle
seems
a
little
off
too
there
is
a
metallic
taste
throughout
the
mouthfeel
seemed
sort
of
light
medium
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
porter
id
like
to
try
it
again
maybe
a
bottle
that
didnt
have
such
a
hard
life
yeah
its
good
but
is
it
4
29
per
bottle
good
for
my
cheapie
arse
not
really
id
rather
spend
9
on
a
sixer
of
almost
as
good
us
stuff
d
this
has
lots
of
potential
but
i
would
like
this
one
a
whole
lot
better
with
less
carbonation
as
it
stands
the
texture
is
a
bit
too
rough
to
drink
very
much
of
this
looove
the
mouthfeel
creamy
yet
crisp
and
just
the
perfect
body
that
makes
it
feel
sturdy
yet
totally
consumable
id
be
happy
to
have
a
few
more
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
thin
carbonation
complements
the
heavy
weight
in
the
mouth
its
still
a
bigger
beer
and
should
be
approached
that
way
for
a
strong
porter
like
this
i
would
have
liked
to
have
more
complexity
and
balance
to
marvel
at
much
more
intriguing
before
the
swallow
than
after
d
so
well
rounded
and
with
exceptional
balance
this
porter
completely
changed
my
perceptions
of
the
style
a
plethora
of
fantastic
flavors
and
aromas
incredible
tastes
roasty
again
very
chocolaty
and
malty
a
big
porter
leaning
toward
stoutish
tendencies
a
nuttiness
pairs
with
the
roasty
qualities
in
the
aftertaste
thin
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
recommend
for
sessioning
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
good
price
no
negative
qualities
to
report
this
bottle
ive
had
for
a
year
probably
not
recommended
for
cellaring
at
extended
periods
very
enjoyable
porter
ill
have
to
remember
to
get
more
man
was
this
black
i
couldnt
hope
for
a
darker
porter
head
was
tiny
but
very
dense
nose
is
full
of
plum
skin
molasses
and
licorice
taste
is
the
same
but
theres
just
the
barest
hint
of
roasty
smokiness
in
the
finish
definitely
a
great
porter
d
this
goes
down
as
smooth
as
a
session
brew
but
with
the
flavor
and
alcohol
content
of
a
big
complex
brew
a
pleasure
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
superb
creamy
medium
to
low
carbonation
slick
and
rich
without
being
cloying
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
then
a
sting
of
hops
and
a
light
fruitiness
shines
thru
the
finish
is
really
smooth
and
drywith
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
edit
6808
not
alot
coming
through
on
the
aroma
still
its
a
bit
more
rounded
with
a
distinct
nuttiness
but
you
still
have
to
search
for
any
chocolate
or
caramel
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
an
alcohol
bite
that
seems
odd
for
a
beer
thats
7
2
on
the
good
side
the
head
keeps
itself
most
of
the
way
down
leaving
tons
of
lacing
looks
perfect
a
masterful
example
of
the
style
the
first
baltic
porter
that
i
could
see
drinking
everyday
a
beer
geeks
beer
for
sure
and
it
helps
if
youre
a
big
roast
malt
fan
i
am
and
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
just
not
one
for
the
masses
pours
a
dark
dark
black
darker
than
a
cola
not
much
of
a
head
the
taste
was
quite
different
from
other
porters
that
i
have
tried
in
the
past
a
sligjt
tartness
accompanied
the
usual
smokey
coffee
porter
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
more
bubbly
than
the
typical
porter
a
variation
that
might
be
the
cause
for
the
tartness
im
not
a
huge
porter
fan
but
i
liked
this
more
than
most
porters
id
try
this
again
if
you
like
the
sweetness
of
baltic
porters
which
is
something
i
love
go
for
okacim
if
you
want
the
roastyness
this
is
your
baltic
porter
pours
out
a
viscous
coal
black
body
with
a
stout
chocolate
milk
head
that
leaves
healthy
rings
of
lacing
smells
like
a
robust
chocolate
milk
coffee
molasses
bread
starts
off
with
a
mix
of
dark
chocolate
raisins
and
pumperknickle
with
a
middle
of
strong
coffee
flavors
finishes
with
a
clean
maltiness
im
to
assume
this
has
been
lagered
and
a
lingering
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
of
cane
syrup
soaked
biscuits
mouthfeel
is
full
viscous
chewy
and
has
a
very
soft
and
mellowed
out
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
but
can
be
a
little
much
at
times
pours
pure
black
with
a
light
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
soy
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
a
little
sour
roastiness
on
the
finish
taste
is
roasty
and
sour
with
some
sweet
coffee
notes
almost
reminiscent
of
a
milk
stout
the
finish
is
even
a
little
sweeter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
less
thick
than
you
might
guess
from
looking
at
it
quite
good
and
drinkable
but
not
quite
so
complex
as
i
remember
it
being
in
the
past
thanks
to
my
secret
santa
numenor1
for
the
opportunity
to
experience
this
a
very
dark
brownblack
beer
no
light
passes
thu
at
all
and
great
lace
some
chocolate
notes
at
first
in
the
aroma
with
a
big
roasted
malt
character
dominating
a
lot
of
bittersweet
chocolate
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
coffee
the
finish
has
a
tantalizing
dry
smokey
character
d
a
fine
sipping
beer
of
excellent
quality
id
certainly
get
this
again
but
keep
it
cellared
a
while
also
its
a
rich
flavorstyle
that
id
like
on
occasion
but
not
too
frequently
ultimately
however
this
porter
certainly
gets
my
seal
of
approval
one
of
the
better
porters
on
the
market
today
1998
bottling
i
was
told
this
was
a
special
thing
to
try
so
i
bought
one
and
drank
it
side
to
side
with
this
years
version
pours
black
with
only
a
hint
of
transparancy
brown
head
rises
out
of
nothingness
and
then
mostly
disappears
again
leaving
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
looks
great
and
liquorlike
smell
has
sherry
cherries
some
chocolate
smells
boozy
and
rich
taste
is
pretty
amazing
and
quite
different
from
the
fresh
bottle
fruity
cherries
and
plums
and
velvety
up
front
with
a
coffee
finish
coming
through
later
the
burnt
coffee
flavor
is
less
strong
than
in
the
fresh
version
and
compliments
the
rest
of
the
flavor
nicely
somewhat
thinner
than
i
expected
based
on
how
it
looked
but
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
very
nice
overall
a
different
beast
than
the
fresh
version
overall
an
outstanding
offering
that
is
truly
in
a
class
of
its
own
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
in
large
quantities
a
very
wellrounded
porter
overall
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
unremarkable
drinkability
well
folks
its
a
good
beer
you
dont
want
to
miss
it
its
the
chimney
soot
that
does
it
1997
bottling
got
it
at
paradiso
in
georgetown
but
none
left
sorry
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
in
ages
if
not
the
best
it
was
the
best
balanced
it
smelled
like
an
expresso
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
notes
in
there
the
palate
was
much
the
same
it
had
a
bit
of
an
oiley
taste
to
it
but
the
chocolate
and
expresso
taste
lasted
through
for
about
a
minute
after
this
beer
finished
the
oiley
finish
allowed
for
all
the
flavors
to
linger
for
at
least
a
minute
making
this
an
easy
sipping
beer
the
mouthfeel
begs
for
more
all
the
flavors
were
incredibly
balanced
making
this
an
incredibly
savory
beer
please
drink
if
you
can
taste
is
surprisingly
sour
although
still
rich
and
round
coffee
plums
and
alcohol
are
the
major
players
in
the
taste
creamy
mellow
finish
with
sharp
hit
of
alcohol
at
the
tail
end
texture
is
smooth
but
a
little
overcarbonated
at
the
front
of
the
sip
this
beer
grows
on
me
as
i
sip
it
but
there
are
a
few
bps
id
choose
over
it
highly
recommended
not
quite
the
match
of
okocim
porter
which
has
a
richer
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
more
figginess
but
still
a
very
fine
baltic
porter
get
some
today
pours
inky
black
with
a
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
smell
is
of
dark
malt
and
port
wine
the
taste
is
dark
malt
with
faint
coffee
bourbon
and
port
the
finish
is
a
slight
tartness
with
a
nice
nutty
quality
this
beer
has
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
very
big
and
robust
with
nice
dark
complex
malts
d
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
my
go
to
porter
when
i
am
at
the
map
room
d
excellent
baltic
porter
one
of
the
best
things
to
come
from
finland
since
my
hot
finnish
aupair
when
i
was
about
10
poured
an
opaque
black
with
one
of
the
darkest
heads
ive
ever
seen
aromas
of
burnt
coffee
and
what
seemed
like
black
olives
immediate
yeasty
tang
on
the
tongue
follwed
by
the
chocolatey
coffee
malts
with
a
nice
lasting
hop
character
at
the
end
sweet
and
sour
raisens
stayed
on
the
tongue
long
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
heavy
brew
feel
balanced
by
the
moderate
carbonation
interesting
texture
a
little
sour
for
this
type
of
porter
for
my
taste
but
good
overall
upon
pouring
this
porter
into
the
16
ounce
tumbler
i
immedialy
noticed
the
nice
head
which
had
good
retention
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
porter
the
taste
was
rich
and
thick
with
a
mingling
of
coffee
and
a
roasted
taste
that
made
me
want
to
keep
the
beer
in
my
mouth
without
swallowing
the
porter
was
also
well
liked
by
others
in
the
room
some
who
are
only
okay
with
porters
the
reason
stated
was
that
it
was
smooth
with
no
bitterness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
had
a
black
color
with
a
dark
tan
thick
head
excellent
lacing
appearance
was
exceptional
with
this
beer
the
smell
was
mostly
roasted
and
coffeelike
with
not
much
else
the
taste
followed
the
smell
with
roastedcoffee
flavors
dominating
and
a
slight
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
complex
i
thought
it
was
very
fullbodied
and
very
smooth
on
the
mouth
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
missing
some
complexity
in
the
taste
overall
a
very
solid
brew
overall
i
found
this
beer
quite
a
step
down
from
okocim
and
even
duck
rabbit
i
was
quite
surprised
after
seeing
the
high
rating
it
has
attained
maybe
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
but
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
ever
had
if
not
the
best
pours
a
deep
dark
pitch
black
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
turns
into
a
thin
lace
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
really
pleasant
malty
aroma
with
some
coffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
taste
is
exceptionally
smooth
that
starts
out
roasty
with
a
lot
of
malt
that
finishes
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
that
is
recommended
to
anyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
it
get
it
if
you
can
find
it
the
pour
into
my
la
moneuse
tulip
raises
a
very
dark
tan
two
finger
head
with
large
bubbles
and
slick
lacing
above
a
mysterious
opaque
body
the
head
falls
at
an
average
rate
to
a
glass
ring
the
nose
is
very
malty
sweet
and
alcoholic
with
raisins
and
other
dark
fruits
leading
to
a
cloying
odor
theres
also
a
strong
roasted
scent
the
taste
is
at
once
toasted
and
sweet
smooth
and
acidic
finishes
with
a
mild
anise
flavor
this
is
quite
mild
but
enjoyable
the
body
is
heavy
with
fairly
low
carbonation
a
nice
drinker
but
not
a
standout
that
ill
seek
again
what
a
beautiful
beer
to
pour
it
leaves
the
bottle
like
oil
thick
black
and
eerily
still
and
settles
into
the
glass
to
form
a
dark
brown
head
the
brew
smells
burnt
with
a
hint
of
raisins
and
a
strong
stale
ale
component
i
was
worried
that
the
sour
flavor
would
overpower
the
others
but
to
my
delight
it
is
just
one
part
of
a
complex
profile
that
profile
is
made
up
of
the
conventional
porter
flavors
but
they
are
exceptionally
balanced
the
sinebrychoff
porter
is
lightly
carbonated
with
one
of
the
most
pleasant
substantial
mouthfeels
i
have
ever
experienced
i
wish
i
had
had
more
than
just
dark
chocolate
to
eat
with
it
im
sure
other
foods
would
highlight
other
flavors
at
one
point
i
disliked
this
style
but
based
on
this
and
southhamptons
ive
changed
my
mind
in
fact
i
may
have
to
revisit
okocim
porter
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
beer
actually
had
this
as
a
sinebrychoff
porter
iv
bottled
in
1997
poured
to
a
jet
black
with
medium
tan
head
and
very
good
lacing
initial
aroma
of
malty
toffee
with
hints
of
chocolate
as
beer
warmed
alcohol
also
made
its
presence
known
in
the
aroma
this
beer
is
fdefinitely
better
as
it
warms
at
midglass
finish
at
first
is
metallic
but
later
on
is
smooth
and
rich
i
hope
i
can
find
another
of
this
kind
and
age
black
with
an
ultra
dark
brown
sugar
colored
head
which
is
rather
thick
and
holds
a
bit
but
does
have
rather
large
bubles
impressive
and
a
bit
unique
looking
aroma
is
distinctly
according
to
style
german
lager
kind
of
aromasa
bit
sweet
with
gentle
grassy
hops
surpsingly
no
alcohol
aroma
detected
the
taste
is
very
distinct
a
baltic
porter
but
with
a
very
charred
and
gritty
black
malt
up
frontmore
of
the
standard
stout
and
charred
porter
characteristics
and
drinking
it
makes
me
think
a
bit
of
otter
creek
stovepipe
porter
after
the
upfront
charred
note
it
turns
into
your
standard
baltic
porter
with
the
lager
characteristics
the
middle
and
finish
standard
in
flavor
but
rather
full
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
not
as
light
as
other
baltic
porters
with
good
carbonationwell
done
here
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
and
no
alcohol
detected
in
aroma
or
flavor
im
not
into
this
style
but
this
is
a
superb
version
for
those
who
do
if
you
ignore
the
price
tag
33
cl
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
despite
the
fact
that
the
label
says
best
before
in
three
languages
it
pours
as
black
as
a
dank
imperial
stout
and
has
a
finger
of
orangeybrown
head
almost
dares
you
to
drink
it
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
cocoa
roasty
malts
currants
blackberries
and
otherwise
sweet
malts
it
has
a
big
roastyburnt
flavor
with
dark
berries
and
lots
of
ibus
from
the
green
hops
and
the
roastycoffee
malts
in
addition
theres
sweet
and
smoky
malts
charcoal
tobacco
juice
some
acidity
old
leather
and
maybe
some
piney
spice
the
body
is
medium
and
a
bit
drying
a
little
numbing
and
leaves
a
looong
roastycoffee
finish
overall
quite
nice
would
go
great
with
barbecue
however
its
probably
better
with
age
as
the
ibus
are
still
a
bit
too
prevalent
d
it
seems
bigger
than
it
actually
is
drinkability
is
great
i
love
a
nice
porter
and
this
one
is
really
nice
hides
its
7
2
abv
well
and
goes
down
smooth
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
poured
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
look
of
this
was
amazing
nice
pitch
black
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
colored
head
that
stayed
the
entire
drink
smell
is
roasted
malt
with
roasted
almonds
as
well
hints
of
coffee
as
well
this
smells
awesome
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
it
is
a
big
beer
with
a
nice
after
ton
very
full
flavored
has
coffee
taste
with
roasted
malt
and
roasted
nuts
very
good
and
top
notch
qualiyt
put
into
this
brew
highly
recommend
very
black
color
especially
dark
for
a
porter
with
no
light
shining
through
thick
reddishtan
head
that
holds
up
well
leaving
frothy
goodness
to
accompany
me
throughout
the
experience
aroma
could
be
a
bit
stronger
very
sweet
and
coffeelike
to
the
nose
a
nice
biscuity
coffee
taste
and
fine
dark
chcolate
sweetness
starts
out
the
flavor
yielding
to
a
wonderfully
roasty
bitter
finish
with
superb
dryness
excellent
mix
of
flavors
and
balance
almost
perfect
compared
to
appearances
the
mouthfeel
is
only
lightly
thick
there
is
a
nice
creaminess
with
its
bubbly
carbonation
i
loved
this
beer
especially
with
its
enjoyable
finish
i
could
drink
several
of
these
drinkability
i
admit
that
i
was
too
anxious
to
try
this
as
it
seems
to
be
universally
enjoyed
but
i
just
dont
think
that
it
is
on
target
33
cl
bottle
very
dark
brown
almost
totally
black
beer
with
a
tan
head
with
some
purplish
tinges
looks
great
mostly
toasted
malty
aromas
but
some
funky
fruitiness
there
too
good
flavours
of
figsraisins
70
cocao
dark
chocolate
and
actually
quite
a
hop
presence
compared
to
others
in
this
category
pretty
exciting
on
the
tongue
though
the
carbonation
is
per
haps
a
touch
to
much
not
the
best
baltic
but
probably
the
most
authentic
i
have
had
good
but
not
great
edit
ok
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
baltic
porter
or
understand
the
ramifications
of
it
im
just
going
to
pretend
like
its
an
imperial
irish
stout
my
first
baltic
porter
pretty
intense
stuff
here
pitch
black
pour
cant
see
through
it
with
a
nice
brown
head
smells
a
bit
liek
chocolate
malts
tastes
like
burnt
malts
cocoa
some
dry
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
overall
it
is
eally
nice
but
one
for
an
evening
is
enough
this
is
a
lot
like
a
imperial
stout
but
hey
im
not
complaining
very
good
maybe
a
little
weak
in
body
but
extremely
tasty
very
drinkable
really
enjoyed
this
baltic
porters
rule
great
baltic
porter
just
a
bit
too
sweet
recommended
this
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
but
leaves
some
nice
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
mixture
of
a
dopplebockesque
and
oatmeal
the
taste
is
just
great
it
hits
you
first
with
the
creamyness
from
the
oatmeal
but
follows
up
with
what
i
can
only
assume
is
dark
roasted
german
malts
the
alcohol
was
less
prevelant
in
the
1998
than
the
2000
there
is
a
little
bit
of
roasted
coffee
lingering
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
thick
with
an
even
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
a
great
one
to
pick
up
sinebrychoff
porter
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
that
shows
a
little
ruby
at
the
edges
from
a
brown
33cl
bottle
the
head
is
tan
and
fluffy
i
pick
up
some
raison
and
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
while
the
beer
is
still
cold
malt
is
also
noticeable
strong
malt
flavor
with
some
esters
thrown
in
at
first
some
chocolate
notes
also
present
a
complex
beer
for
sure
recommended
this
is
from
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
that
i
could
find
on
it
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
half
inch
brown
head
which
went
away
pretty
quickly
its
a
very
very
nice
looking
beer
it
smells
like
malt
molasses
coffee
and
chocolate
it
tastes
mainly
like
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
sherry
in
there
as
well
good
bit
of
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
as
well
it
has
a
medium
oilyslick
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
even
with
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
its
still
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
one
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
to
try
d
very
big
and
robust
with
nice
dark
complex
malts
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
any
more
of
these
bottles
hidden
around
local
beer
stores
worth
a
shot
moderate
price
cheers
what
a
nice
beer
pitch
black
with
a
short
tan
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
and
tastes
of
rich
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
and
sherry
reminds
me
of
a
nicely
aged
brooklyn
chocolate
stout
the
palate
is
rich
but
light
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
complexity
but
overall
im
impressed
edit
drank
the
98
in
february
2007
with
northyorksammy
grub
biegaman
and
derek
has
held
up
really
well
a
little
soy
sauce
but
still
very
drinkable
however
wouldnt
leave
this
much
longer
ss
overall
comments
not
as
balticy
as
some
of
the
others
ive
had
but
this
works
very
well
on
its
own
and
has
its
own
merits
great
flavor
without
being
overpowering
certainly
worth
getting
to
know
better
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
afforded
to
stock
up
on
these
i
highly
recommend
this
lovely
porter
d
there
is
no
hint
of
the
7
2
percent
in
this
beer
simply
amazing
bottled
in
2000
unlike
many
other
reviewers
samples
this
bottle
doesnt
look
very
beat
up
at
all
pours
quite
black
and
impenetrable
with
a
thin
bubbling
lightcocoa
foam
cap
aromas
of
plums
chocolate
cake
batter
and
a
dusty
smoke
scent
taste
begins
sour
then
expands
into
a
delicious
chewy
chocolate
flavor
the
finish
is
bitter
and
earthy
with
understated
hops
and
a
light
smokiness
mediumthin
body
silksmooth
mouthfeel
this
can
be
easily
if
not
entirely
accurately
described
as
a
topnotch
russian
imperial
stout
by
flavor
and
a
dry
stout
by
body
and
mouthfeel
incredible
taste
i
cant
believe
how
well
this
has
held
up
over
six
years
absolutely
deserving
of
all
the
praise
it
gets
hands
down
the
best
baltic
porter
ill
have
for
a
while
there
is
something
mature
and
well
developed
about
this
porter
this
is
simply
a
really
good
version
of
a
baltic
porter
taste
the
coffee
and
dark
fruits
really
come
out
on
the
first
few
sips
along
with
a
bit
of
licorice
theres
a
strong
roasted
maltiness
with
some
touches
of
wood
and
a
little
alcohol
the
chocolate
character
starts
to
come
through
as
this
gets
warmer
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
so
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
several
more
drinkability
easy
drinking
even
though
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
and
this
heavier
in
body
great
beer
got
to
get
more
really
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
complex
with
overtones
galore
highly
recommended
and
i
beer
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
dam
this
beer
is
full
bodied
the
beer
has
a
minimalist
carbonation
just
one
malty
beer
treat
a
dam
fine
drinking
beer
understandable
of
why
this
is
among
the
best
porters
on
ba
it
offers
a
big
combinaiton
of
flavors
in
a
managable
body
an
opaqued
burned
brown
color
with
an
amazing
brown
moist
foamstand
to
match
mouthwatering
in
its
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
aromas
less
sweet
to
the
taste
than
i
expected
but
big
of
its
flavor
profile
toasty
roasty
cocoa
and
a
little
campfireish
without
being
smoky
powdery
and
charcoal
like
to
the
palate
without
becomming
harsh
or
burned
in
flavor
or
feel
finishes
very
very
clean
despite
a
usual
grain
acceptance
the
7
alcohols
are
hardly
detectableneither
hot
nor
phenolic
balanced
with
light
hopping
and
roasted
grain
high
attenuation
leads
to
a
lighter
beer
but
keeps
its
bold
flavors
tremendous
beer
only
the
light
fermentation
that
reminds
me
of
lactose
and
light
body
keeps
me
from
serving
up
a
5
0
as
with
most
baltic
porters
ive
tried
this
thing
needs
a
moment
to
air
out
in
the
glass
to
reach
ultimate
drinkabilty
otherwise
that
metallic
tinge
is
just
too
pronounced
earthy
and
smoky
at
the
right
temp
it
becomes
really
tasty
this
is
a
damn
good
baltic
porter
it
has
porter
qualities
like
chocolate
and
fruits
as
opposed
to
coffee
like
like
a
stout
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
hops
are
low
and
alcohol
warmth
is
there
a
winner
by
all
standards
well
mine
anyway

malts
through

somthing
about
this
reminds
me
of
rum
rasin
wow
i
was
totally
blown
away
by
this
porter
terrific
looking
brew
giant
three
finger
tall

tan

and
very
frothy
fades
after
a
few
minutes
clumpy
spotty
lacing
around
the
glass
strong
roasted

smell
with
hints
of
alcohol
reminds
me
of
malted
milk
balls
very
sweet
and
very
well
balanced
a
definite
treat
by
far
the
best
tasting
porter
ive
had
lots
of
carbonation
and
silky
smooth
even
though
this
has
an
abv
of
7
2
i
could
enjoy
this
brew
all
night
long
highly
recommended
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
porter
with
a
medium
dark
creamy
had
with
very
good
retention
aroma
of
chocolate
is
omnipresent
with
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
body
is
full
and
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
that
is
very
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
chocolate
malt
with
nice
light
bitter
ending
very
nice
example
for
the
style
and
probably
even
better
then
okocim
prefer
a
bit
fresher
than
8
years
old
glad
i
tried
it
a
truely
great
porter
suitable
for
the
baltic
winters
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
flavorful
porter
id
be
interested
in
doing
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
different
vintages
1997
vintage

huge
vinous
and
oak
aromas
pound
their
way
out
of
this
old
but
solid
brew
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
heavy
especially
when
compared
sidebyside
with
a
2004
vintage
as
i
am
doing
taste
is
dominated
by
molasses
thick
sugary
coffee
and
blended
prunes
mildly
earthy
too
drinkability
is
as
good
as
it
can
be
with
a
baltic
porter
appearance
is
a
dark
slightly
clouded
mahoganywalnut
blend
d
sort
of
sessionable
but
a
bit
strong
it
has
a
powerful
flavor
that
would
overshadow
many
foods
i
imagine
that
it
would
pair
well
with
most
nuts
particularly
almonds
and
macademia
nuts
a
pleasant
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
rich
and
smooth
lightly
carbonated
chocolate
and
raisinsprunes
in
the
flavor
with
a
dark
chocolate
bitterness
and
caramelly
sweetness
amazingly
richly
drinkable
especially
as
it
warms
on
par
with
or
better
than
almost
any
imperial
stout
to
those
who
think
baltic
porters
are
the
same
as
a
dopplebock
i
present
to
you
this
beer
the
coffee
flavor
is
this
one
is
just
great
i
dont
know
if
there
could
be
a
better
beer
for
this
style
or
any
porter
for
that
matter
i
love
this
beer
finland
here
i
come
very
substantial
mouthfeel
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
the
head
looks
like
a
rootbeer
float
long
lasting
head
overall
i
detect
more
sweetness
and
smokiness
than
roastiness
and
choclate
and
while
this
is
still
great
beer
its
not
ever
going
to
be
a
favorite
d
with
its
alcohol
warmth
and
coffee
tastes
this
makes
an
excellent
sipping
beer
for
long
conversations
or
reading
a
book
through
a
winter
afternoon
intimidating
black
body
with
a
manilakhaki
head
the
beer
was
not
very
lively
nothing
overly
jumpy
on
the
nose
of
mouth
but
at
7
2
it
went
down
easily
just
a
silky
smooth
cigar
smoking
chair
smooth
this
beer
is
widely
complex
but
at
the
same
time
simple
up
front
and
basic
a
winner
mouthfeel
a
little
oily
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
leaves
a
velvety
feeling
on
the
palate
along
with
a
little
roasted
bitterness
overall
a
great
beer
i
remember
liking
it
more
than
i
like
it
now
ill
come
back
to
it
in
the
future
pours
thick
and
oily
with
a
beautiful
dark
tan
head
great
aroma
full
of
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
huge
flavors
coffee
immature
prune
peppery
alcohol
and
some
caney
sweetness
but
just
a
touch
its
these
flavors
that
i
imagine
would
meld
wonderfully
with
aging
this
porter
is
thick
spicy
on
the
tongue
with
a
significant
alcohol
burn
long
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
quaffable
this
is
just
an
excellent
beer
drinkability
a
great
porter
strong
but
not
over
the
top
extremely
drinkable
excellent
i
suggest
you
go
and
try
it
vintage
1998
bottle
purchased
at
bello
vino
in
ann
arbor
poured
out
to
a
dark
opaque
black
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
vanished
a
small
tan
film
is
all
that
is
left
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
low
carbonation
minor
notes
of
lacing
aromas
were
strikingly
similar
to
a
red
wine
at
first
dark
fruits
and
dark
chocolate
are
first
followed
by
some
roasted
characters
and
mild
malts
taste
is
nearly
exceptional
strong
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
followed
with
a
solid
medium
bodied
malt
and
a
raw
molasses
flavor
fill
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
nominal
level
of
density
yet
not
thick
or
syruplike
decent
drinkability
im
glad
i
experienced
this
one
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
ive
had
recommended
drinkability
so
thick
and
complex
that
its
hard
to
have
just
one
but
i
really
have
to
stop
drinking
it
so
fast
because
its
definitely
going
down
quickly
and
easily
i
paid
2
99
for
the
bottle
and
that
was
definitely
more
than
worth
it
make
sure
your
palate
can
handle
it
though
because
this
sucker
takes
no
prisoners
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
good
a
head
and
good
retention
aroma
is
slightly
of
burnt
raisins
but
also
a
funky
smell
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
its
almost
like
that
of
my
dogs
treats
taste
is
raisiny
and
chocolatly
and
a
hit
of
coffee
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkablity
its
interesting
i
will
finish
this
bottle
for
sure
but
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
again
its
a
very
clean
nonlingering
beer
outstanding
porter
finland
needs
to
make
more
beer
probably
my
favorite
porter
out
there
dark
pour
gives
off
a
yellow
hue
like
iodine
skinny
ring
of
foaminess
barely
countable
smells
like
dark
chocolate
melted
in
a
rich
red
wine
unique
aroma
appetizing
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
moldy
age
that
morphs
into
coffeeground
bitterness
underlying
port
character
and
molasses
sweetness
offers
perfect
balance
mildly
fruity
barely
something
here
whispers
butterscotch
and
a
bit
of
fermented
tang
in
the
finish
reminds
you
this
is
beer
light
and
smooth
dark
and
dank
this
beer
is
a
perfect
evening
sipper
leaps
and
bounds
beyond
perkuno
who
knew
finland
was
producing
anything
with
flavor
overall
im
very
glad
this
was
recommended
to
me
will
definitely
need
further
tastings
to
try
and
savor
all
that
this
complex
porter
has
to
offer
bottled
in
1997
this
brew
pours
a
thick
motor
oil
black
color
with
no
head
what
so
ever
the
aroma
is
very
rich
caramel
chocolate
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
largely
of
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
in
the
back
ground
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
the
brew
isnt
bad
but
i
think
it
may
be
past
its
prime
pours
an
intensely
opaque
black
with
a
thick
creamyfoamy
bumpy
coffeecolored
head
that
looks
like
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
mmmm
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
anywho
nose
is
potent
fresh
coffee
grounds
bakers
chocolate
and
dark

taste
starts
off
with
juicy
raisins
sweet
prunes
apple
and
grape
skins
and
trasitions
into
creamy
milk
chocolate
mousse
and
mocha
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
frothy
coating
the
mouth
with
fine
bubbly
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
tasty
baltic
porter
the
most
complex
and
balanced
that
ive
had
to
date
many
go
overboard
with
sickly
sweetsour
prunes
but
the
creamy
milk
chocolate
takes
over
a
pleasant
surprise
from
finland
not
just
reindeer
anymore
pours
an
opaque
black
big
tan
head
that
lasts
forever
sticky

strong

and
one
of
the
best
aftertastes
ever
especially
for
a
coffee
lover
drinkability
a
roasted
coffee
flavored
bold
porter
yeah
thats
why
i
got
in
to
craft
beer
in
the
first
place
i
realize
that
the
line
between
stout
and
porter
is
fuzzy
at
best
and
this
one
does
nothing
but
fuel
that
fuzziness
i
can
see
why
its
highly
touted
i
think
people
who
dont
like
porters
but
like
stouts
yeah
im
talking
to
you
hardtarget
would
enjoy
this
one
strongly
recommended
for
sure
sinebrychoff
porter
is
almostsoclosebutnotquite
black
just
the
smallest
bit
of
a
red
highlight
along
the
bottom
giant
rocky
chocolatecolored
head
that
soon
settles
to
a
goodlooking
skim
of
brown
bubbles
that
hangs
around
for
awhile
providing
good
lacing
smell
and
taste
combine
gentle
roasted
flavors
with
a
sweet
pruneyraisiny
character
that
grows
in
prominence
as
the
beer
warms
overall
though
the
flavor
is
pleasant
but
subdued
the
former
perhaps
a
result
of
the
lattertoo
much
of
the
dark
fruits
character
can
kill
me
on
some
baltics
also
the
sinebrychoff
hides
its
alcohol
immaculately
a
big
body
and
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
finish
off
what
is
a
surprisingly
easydrinking
big
beer
pours
a
viscous
inky
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
imposing
brew
aroma
is
roasty
with
some
astringency
dark
chocolate
some
prune
and
plum
and
some
mineraly
hops
the
flavor
has
an
intense
roasted
character
that
is
a
bit
astringent
and
bitter
some
unsweetened
chocolate
ripe
prune
and
fig
charcoal
and
some
earthy
organic
hops
the
is
a
very
interesting
beer
reminds
me
of
carnegie
porter
on
steroids
very
complex
and
somewhat
bitter
and
astringent
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
but
true
to
style
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
only
slight
alcohol
notes
excellent
traditional
baltic
porter
has
none
of
the
sweet
character
exhibited
by
american
interpretations
but
is
balanced
and
complex
overall
sinebrychoff
porter
was
a
damn
nice
brew
that
is
one
i
now
consider
to
set
the
bar
as
a
premier
example
of
the
style
worth
procuring
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
savored
my
way
through
it
nice
not
quite
the
treat
that
okocim
porter
is
but
definitely
a
pleasurable
baltic
porter
in
its
own
right
cheers
beertracker
such
a
wonderfully
intense
charcoal
layer
all
over
bits
of
dried
bing
cherry
whole
milk
mouthfeel
licorice
root
sweetness
toasted
cumin
and
coriander
mighty
tasty
for
something
the
color
of
satans
soul
in
my
opinion
this
porter
is
a
near
cousin
to
an
english
stout
and
i
would
like
to
try
another
one
that
is
not
as
well
aged
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
are
balance
very
well
poured
mostly
opaque
black
with
red
edges
and
a
huge
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
mildly
metallic
coffee
aroma
dark
fruits
chocolate
coffee
and
bitter
hops
in
the
taste
some
smoke
was
also
recognized
i
think
i
was
expecting
too
much
from
this
but
it
was
a
beautiful
beer
regradless
my
expectations
were
just
set
way
too
high
the
scores
reflect
a
mix
of
both
the
appearance
of
the
younger
beer
was
better
while
smell
of
the
older
beer
was
far
richer
the
edge
in
taste
goes
to
the
older
beer
as
well
in
the
mouthfeel
department
there
was
more
going
on
in
the
younger
beer
but
the
older
was
more
pleasant
overall
id
take
the
older
beer
as
the
more
drinkable
and
interesting
of
the
two
tastes
superyummy
rum
soaked
raisins
surf
a
roast
bitter
a
chocolate
sweet
lies
beneath
the
surface
and
eventually
tangles
the
bitter
to
leave
a
wet
sweet
fruity
with
some
fine
chocolate
the
aftertaste
shows
a
reappearance
of
some
of
the
roast
with
a
touch
of
cherry
sour
from
black
patent
so
much
happening
each
time
i
raise
the
glass
that
i
cant
keep
up
really
complex
with
lotsa
individual
flavors
that
combine
to
make
even
more
flavors
to
try
to
keep
track
of
mdthick
body
with
a
somewhat
smooth
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
really
enjoyable
11
2
ounce
bottle
black
with
a
large
dark
brown
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
this
beer
has
a
big
chocolate
flavor
besides
the
chocolate
theres
nuts
and
vanilla
big
on
flavor
and
so
smooth
there
is
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
could
be
just
a
little
fuller
but
its
hard
to
find
fault
with
a
beer
this
good
nice
deep
chocolate
body
with
a
light
deep
beige
head
that
left
little
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
like
a
malt
kick
to
the
face
nice
toasted
cocoa
and
espresso
filled
the
nose
the
taste
is
filled
with
a
bittersweet
cocoa
and
nutty
body
vanilla
bean
also
makes
a
strong
appearance
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
rich
like
an
italian
coffee
it
becomes
a
little
thin
towards
the
finish
this
beer
is
insanely
smooth
and
deceptively
strong
this
would
definately
be
one
that
i
would
be
hitting
all
nigth
if
it
were
on
tap
on
a
night
out
or
in
my
basement
there
wasnt
much
difference
at
all
between
this
1998
and
the
2000
that
i
reviewed
a
few
days
ago
httpwww
beeradvocate
combeerprofile2642758baquaffer
they
were
both
excellent
beers
about
the
only
difference
that
i
could
detect
was
that
the
98
had
less
of
the
heavy
sweetness
to
it
that
the
00
had
it
was
still
there
and
on
the
bright
side
its
diminished
presence
didnt
make
the
beer
taste
any
thinner
just
more
of
the
tart
fruit
and
smoke
seemed
to
come
through
a
little
sharper
overall
but
the
scores
remained
the
same
fantastic
well
worth
the
money
spent
pitch
black
topped
by
a
dense
creamy
chocolatey
head
lots
of
lace
and
great
retention
malty
aroma
with
lots
of
roasted
character
plenty
of
coffee
sweet
smelling
vinous
flavour
with
a
nice
combination
of
dark
malts
and
an
earthy
fruity
character
bittersweet
chocolate
throughout
coffee
really
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
slightly
astringent
with
a
moderately
light
body
and
carbonation
still
quite
a
creamy
texture
quite
a
nice
beer
quite
drinkable
with
plenty
of
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
frothy
somehow
ive
run
short
of
words
to
describe
this
particular
aspect
of
the
beer
but
ive
been
longwinded
enough
as
it
is
its
not
too
highly
drinkable
as
the
tastes
and
alcohol
get
to
be
overwhelming
after
a
while
but
it
was
still
a
great
beer
if
you
hadnt
already
gathered
that
much
three
years
old
at
the
time
of
sampling
and
had
indeed
aged
like
fine
wine
poured
a
pitch
black
pleasantly
assertive
with
nearlyburned
caramel
and
prune
flavors
hitting
up
front
dries
out
a
bit
toward
the
middle
and
a
bit
more
hops
bittering
join
with
the
dried
dark
fruit
flavors
at
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
overall
the
body
was
a
bit
lighter
than
the
flavor
suggested
but
this
was
not
a
detraction
it
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
little
chocolate
and
a
little
roasted
malts
but
its
not
very
strong
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
sweetness
the
finish
is
bitter
from
the
roasted
malts
fairly
thick
on
the
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
enjoyable
great
great
stuff
worth
seeking
out
are
all
the
beers
in
finland
this
good
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
trid
this
brew
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
coating
over
the
beer
the
color
is
beautiful
the
nose
is
a
little
light
i
get
dark
fruit
slight
roasty
notes
and
a
little
sweet
chocolate
i
would
like
a
little
more
force
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
nice
first
i
get
slight
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
with
a
distant
fig
but
it
moves
fast
to
a
big
roasted
creshendo
at
the
end
as
it
warms
there
is
much
more
of
a
fig
tone
in
there
which
i
really
like
beautiful
the
feel
is
on
the
low
end
of
thick
best
part
of
this
beer
is
that
there
is
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
at
all
not
in
the
nose
or
the
flavor
this
is
a
truely
good
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
was
kind
of
surprised
to
find
this
one
at
my
local
store
but
im
glad
i
did
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
this
was
perfect
at
the
end
of
the
work
week
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
strength
rather
well
i
could
drink
it
all
night
but
at
5
a
pop
i
would
want
to
save
them
especially
since
this
could
taste
really
tasty
if
it
gets
cellared
for
a
while
poured
into
a
snifter
with
an
opaque
black
color
and
brown
head
of
1
12
the
head
retention
is
good
for
a
porter
settling
down
to
groups
of
hearty
suds
on
the
surface
ripe
plums
anise
dark
chocolate
and
black
coffee
in
the
nose
the
balance
of
flavors
relies
on
how
rich
the
malt
character
is
and
how
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
right
at
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
well
toasted
malt
flavor
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
just
slightly
estery
roasty
malt
and
just
a
tad
bitter
drinkability
oh
hell
yes
one
of
my
personal
5
favorite
porters
id
drink
this
all
day
long
mouthfeel
is
just
abou
right
for
a
porter
in
that
it
heavy
and
not
overly
carbonated
and
it
doesnt
try
to
push
itself
into
stout
territory
either
a
very
very
nice
example
of
the
style
this
brew
pours
with
a
beautiful
12in
dark
brown
head
the
color
is
like
that
of
looking
into
a
black
hole
so
dark
you
cant
tell
its
depth
there
is
a
nice
smoked
malt
character
in
the
aroma
along
with
chocolate
notes
the
taste
was
exceptional
let
me
tell
you
there
is
an
intense
and
amazing
chocolate
creamy
almost
indescribable
flavor
that
makes
you
beg
for
more
i
could
taste
smoked
malt
flavors
that
added
to
the
overall
pleasurable
mouthfeel
of
the
wonderful
brew
i
can
picture
enjoying
this
beer
with
a
few
grilled
sardines
pickled
herrings
a
shot
of
aquavit
and
some
smoked
salmon
this
is
a
bold
brew
that
would
compliment
the
lingering
oily
taste
of
smoked
or
pickled
fish
a
dark
black
pour
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
creamy
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
earthy
aromas
tobacco
bitter
chocolate
dark
roasted
coffee
prune
rich
and
malty
flavors
along
with
chocolate
espresso
cabernet
molasses
creamy
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
excellent
drinkability
damn
tasty
overall
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
and
very
reminiscent
to
imperial
stout
a
definite
must
highly
recommended
from
what
i
understand
this
is
no
longer
available
in
the
united
states
too
bad
because
its
a
good
beer
sinebrychoffs
porter
is
a
middledeck
homerun
the
bottle
says
its
best
before
27

2003
im
still
giving
it
a
shot
the
color
is
black
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
of
roasted
malts
with
a
distinct
smoked
smell
taste
is
of
roasted
chocolate
with
an
earthy
smoked
taste
overall
the
taste
is
very
good
but
just
a
bit
underwhelming
most
of
the
standard
english
or
american
porters
seem
to
have
a
more
engaging
flavor
off
course
this
could
be
because
the
beer
is
a
little
old
and
probably
wasnt
aged
properly
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
which
adds
to
my
drinkability
this
is
great
stuff
just
a
tad
unwhelming
i
wonder
how
great
it
would
be
fresh
or
corrrectly
aged
ill
be
looking
for
fresher
bottles
in
the
future

towards

tasty
and
then
tasty
some
more
world
class
a
truly
exceptional
porter
an
imperial
porter
this
is
powerful
entry
to
my
porter
experience
perhaps
the
best
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
the
samuel
smith
pale
ales
while
the
flavor
is
far
more
dark
in
a
good
wayblack
patent
and
chocolate
malts
are
very
evident
absolute
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
quickly
disappearing
chocolate
milk
colored
head
aroma
is
of
ripe
dark
fruits
with
a
nice
combination
of
toasted
and
patent
malts
there
is
a
subtle
alcohol
nose
the
taste
is
quite
complex
the
main
components
are
the
toasted
malts
which
have
subtle
hints
of
coffee
the
flavor
finishes
slightly
chocolaty
there
is
also
a
nice
ripe
fruit
essence
which
compliments
the
other
flavors
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
with
a
slight
oily
character
it
coats
the
mouth
well
and
leaves
a
pleasant
finish
lingering
around
this
is
damn
good
thats
all
i
can
say
i
could
easily
down
a
couple
of
these
and
enjoy
every
sip
of
it
drinkability
paid
more
than
i
wanted
for
this
one
but
after
i
had
it
id
wish
i
grabbed
another
couple
this
dude
was
almost
2
years
past
the
best
by
date
and
it
was
still
pretty
incredible
im
just
coming
around
into
the
world
of
porters
and
this
may
be
the
one
that
makes
me
turn
the
corner
and
try
more
when
i
saw
on
the
shelf
and
looked
at
the
3
49
price
tag
i
laughed
and
almost
walked
away
because
it
looked
like
just
another
one
of
those
euro
beers
that
you
have
never
heard
of
then
i
thought
to
myself
heck
ive
never
seen
or
heard
of
this
one
before
and
may
never
see
it
again
what
if
its
actually
good
id
kick
myself
if
i
got
home
and
read
the
reviews
and
they
were
positive
so
i
figured
what
the
hell
ill
only
be
out
a
few
bucks
if
im
wrong
im
glad
i
was
right
so
glad
two
big
thumbs
up
pours
out
an
oily
black
with
a
slow
rising
light
brown
head
some
decent
lacing
left
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
strong
chocolate
malts
and
dark
fruits
stand
out
the
most
lighter
notes
of
roastiness
linger
in
the
back
as
this
warmed
the
vinous
qualities
really
came
on
strong
sweet
dark
chocolate
cover
fruits
come
out
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
present
but
the
strong
vinous
qualities
covered
that
ends
with
a
dark
sweet
fruitiness
medium
and
slick
in
the
mouth
very
easy
drinking
brew
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
a
great
example
of
the
style
that
had
a
good
mix
of
flavors
going
on
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
two
years
later
had
a
1998
that
displayed
alcohol
as
often
an
aged
beer
will
do
and
chocolate
light
crown
with
bubbles
and
lace
on
top
of
black
low
carbonation
past
its
prime
medium
brown
small
head
cold
coffee
look
cold
coffee
aroma
too
joined
with
dark
chocolate
and
nougat
flavor
is
chocolate
tobacco
smoke
tar
and
pine
sap
fudgy
at
times
with
fugglesish
flavor
thick
smooth
dry
the
alcohol
is
present
and
it
is
a
bit
oily
a
good
beer
but
not
as
alive
as
i
would
like
and
not
as
good
as
this
style
can
get
a
beer
from
finland
eh
this
is
new
for
me
although
ive
sampled
some
american
baltic
porters
this
stuff
pours
out
thick
black
light
does
not
penetrate
it
looks
more
like
an
imp
stout
to
me
nice
tan
head
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
raisins
with
a
bit
of
coffee
type
maltiness
in
the
background
taste
is
quite
subtle
there
is
alot
going
on
here
but
its
hard
to
pinpoint
any
of
it
definitely
some
chocolateycoffee
type
flavors
along
with
some
alcohol
but
nothing
is
jumping
out
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
quite
watery
there
is
decent
carbonation
but
nothing
special
here
drinkability
is
not
so
hot
in
my
book
but
the
thin
mouthfeel
helps
a
bit
porters
stouts
are
not
my
thing
it
seems
lately
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
baltic
outside
of
heavyweights
perkunos
hammer
i
would
defiantly
recommend
it
and
hope
to
sample
a
few
more
authentic
examples
of
the
style
dextremely
smooth
and
drinkable
i
would
love
to
have
a
couple
more
of
these
overall
powerful
porter
imperial
this
one
is
black
as
night
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
chocolatey
with
rum
soaked
dark
fruits
bread
and
a
slight
bit
of
roastiness
the
aroma
is
just
awesome
the
flavor
is
malty
and
bready
it
then
flows
to
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
flavor
again
just
a
tad
bit
of
roasted
malt
is
present
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
almost
velvety
it
is
very
drinkable
for
its
strength
an
excellent
porter
one
of
my
favorites
if
not
the
best
one
ive
yet
to
have
this
is
good
and
ill
try
it
again
but
i
seek
a
less
dry
profile
notes
wow
this
is
one
tasty
beer
definitely
a
great
one
for
coffee
and
chocolate
lovers
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
nose
though
doesnt
seem
to
match
well
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
a
helluva
beer
im
a
bit
surprised
by
the
lack
of
fruit
notes
and
maltsweetness
isnt
it
a
bit
out
of
character
for
a
baltic
porter
this
was
quite
interesting
although
im
not
sure
the
bottle
was
worth
it
four
bucks
nevertheless
its
fun
to
drink
a
really
old
beer
and
see
how
well
its
aged
or
not
this
one
seems
to
have
held
up
well
the
beer
was
medium
to
fullbodied
there
definitely
was
some
unfermented
sugar
remaining
and
perhaps
that
is
why
it
was
so
drinkable
it
was
like
a
molasses
candy
drink
with
plenty
of
spice
from
the
hops
and
dark
malts
this
beer
is
a
delight
and
highly
recommended
i
love
baltic
porters
sinebrychoff
porter
doesnt
quite
supplant
perkunos
hammer
in
my
mind
but
it
is
outstanding
beer
and
has
few
peers
in
its
class
baltic
porter
is
one
of
my
favorite
nonhoppy
styles
and
this
bottle
does
nothing
to
change
that
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
beers
that
is
readily
available
to
me
reflection
this
was
a
pretty
good
porter
i
plan
on
picking
up
more
so
my
buddies
can
try
it
dark
dark
brew
truly
black
with
a
sticky
brown
lace
that
looks
like
a
styrofoam
pillow
smoked
wood
burnt
chocolate
bittersweet
bars
of
lindt
and
some
subtle
vinous
fruit
notes
this
smells
big
and
it
tastesfeels
big
too
thick
body
with
a
warming
pleasant
subdued
charcoal
flavor
that
unlies
the
entire
experience
black
malts
and
a
hint
of
java
round
out
the
roasted
flavors
but
this
really
is
dominated
by
chocolate
chocolate
powder
and
malted
milk
balls
punch
through
the
initial
sip
the
roastiness
builds
as
you
drink
this
but
theres
a
slurp
of
chocolate
in
every
drink
a
delightful
classic
12oz

with

fingers

the

rich
and
malty
lots

roasted

along
with
some
dark

and

just
a
touch
of

the
taste
is
also
malty
with
lots
of
burnt
malt
toffee
and
a
touch
of
espresso
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth

just
a

good

brew
a
nice
baltic
porter
cheers
almost
black
but
there
seems
to
be
a
very
dark
mahogany
influence
as
well
when
i
held
this
beer
to
a
light
it
didnt
allow
any
penetration
of
the
liquid
opaque
the
head
reached
two
fingers
in
height
and
it
was
a
beautiful
brunette
color
i
really
liked
the
head
color
the
foam
slowly
faded
to
a
soapy
cap
lacing
started
before
i
started
to
remove
the
liquid
a
foamy
cap
lasted
the
entire
consumption
overall
the
lacing
was
webby
and
messy
but
very
prevalent
in
my
stemmed
glass
it
looked
exquisite
the
nose
was
a
very
lovely
mix
of
dark
fruits
and
roasty
qualities
the
malt
provided
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
beans
and
some
true
roast
that
produced
charred
wood
influences
oats
caramel
in
the
middle
is
raw
alcohol
which
is
too
naked
and
talkative
unpleasant
the
finish
recovers
nicely
and
offers
some
cherries
plums
and
prunes
at
the
very
end
is
a
big
blast
of
chocolate
that
really
propels
the
nose
it
ends
on
a
high
note
potency
is
moderate
but
expressive
too
bad
i
can
clearly
hear
the
cussing
from
the
alcohol
still
the
bouquet
is
inviting
maybe
too
clean
as
the
nose
lacks
a
symbiotic
aura
the
palate
caught
me
off
guard
a
little
it
had
more
roast
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
there
is
a
big
jolt
of
roasty
qualities
that
range
from
char
to
smoky
to
woody
to
espresso
to
black
coffee
to
chocolate
each
quality
shines
a
little
at
a
time
the
espresso
and
chocolate
are
the
loudest
astringent
bitter
fruit
in
the
middle
largely
dark
and
tropical
cherries
and
plums
mainly
then
follows
some
sweetness
it
strikes
with
perfect
timing
caramel
brown
sugar
milk
chocolate
oats
im
really
digging
this
at
the
finish
is
the
alcohol
kind
of
raw
too
naked
too
hot
but
it
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
it
does
stop
it
from
being
truly
remarkable
the
palate
is
very
charming
long
bitter
yet
sweet
aftertaste
with
lots
of
coffee
influences
dry
with
earthy
hops
damn
this
is
good
the
alcohol
is
noticed
yes
but
it
doesnt
play
itself
i
mean
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
beer
with
a
7
abv
it
drinks
like
a
much
smaller
beer
and
that
could
be
dangerous
in
other
words
this
is
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
beer
worthy
of
my
850th
review
here
on
ba
medium
in
body
a
tickle
thin
it
seems
the
carbonation
is
very
light
too
light
imo
and
this
produces
a
slick
mouthfeel
id
like
a
little
more
bulk
but
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
the
mouthfeel
it
is
pleasant
my
bottle
is
over
a
year
past
its
best
by
date
couldve
fooled
me
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
can
buy
it
in
iowa
this
bottle
was
purchased
in
minnesota
mn
i
should
have
bought
more
as
good
as
it
is
when
i
drink
this
again
it
will
be
standalone
no
cheese
here
please
this
bad
boy
is
flying
solo
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
seek
it
out
enjoy
it
recommended
cap
comes
off
with
a
loud
rushing
pop
no
wonder
this
pours
with

bubbles
beer
is

black

black
but
matte
black

foamily
and

well
gah
it
really
clings
in
keeping
with
the
sluggish
viscosity
of
the
brew
aromas
of
carbonized
chocolate
burned

finishes
with
a

side
in

i
wanted
it
to
lay
it
on
me
heavier
for
an
instant
the
sweetness
of
overdried
prune
skins
hovers
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
before
plunging
into
oily
poppyseed
depths
charred
wood
coffee
grounds
and
raw
cocoa
float
around
in
the
gloom
finishes
with
smoldering
hop
stalks
hash
resin
and
residual
carbons
in
a
surprisingly
even
aftertaste
slightly
greasy
mouthfeel
with
no
detectable
carbonation
seems
to
gain
sludginess
as
it
decends
from
mouth
to
belly
drinkability
is
better
than
i
expected
i
could
semigulp
this
despite
the
heavy
flavor
but
it
would
probably
kick
my
ass
in
due
fashion
dont
forget
this
beer
on
your
next
trip
to
the
tundra
a
great
balanced
brew
a
favorite
taste
is
very
similar
rich
sugary
dark
fruit
mix
in
with
chocolate
liquer
before
roasted
coffee
bitterness
balances
the
palate
coffee
bitter
lasts
well
into
the
finish
theres
a
sour
twang
vaguely
present
throughout
the
taste
that
was
unexpected
but
not
bad
per
se
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
for
the
style
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
vintage
1997
bottle
of
this
stuff
at
spirit
haus
in
amherst
ma
great
store
by
the
way
dark
velvet
black
appearance
with
a
slight
brown
head
beauty
in
a
glass
smells
strongly
of
port
wine
bitter
chocolate
dried
fruit
and
coffee
grounds
with
faint
wisps
of
alcohol
taste
is
out
of
this
world
gorgeous
port
wine
sweetness
up
front
with
lots
of
fruity
complexity
figs
dried
fruit
and
raisins
all
come
to
mind
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
also
swirl
themselves
around
in
this
brew
roasted
malt
is
big
in
this
beer
yet
floral
hops
and
all
of
the
wonderful
complex
flavors
of
this
beer
balance
everything
out
very
well
it
feels
like
im
drinking
black
silk
not
thick
at
all
like
some
porters
a
very
thin
consistency
makes
for
incredible
smoothness
and
makes
it
surprising
that
this
beer
is
as
flavorful
as
it
is
a
real
treat
to
drink
i
dont
think
ive
ever
raved
as
much
about
a
beer
but
this
brew
is
so
fantastic
that
it
warrants
such
raving
this
is
one
every
beer
enthusiast
should
seek
out
because
it
is
such
a
unique
gem
wowie
zowie
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
bubbly
firm
offwhitechocolate
head
that
is
just
simply
beautiful
after
a
couple
minutes
a
nice
lace
is
left
behind
after
the
head
recedes
aromas
are
slighty
roasty
with
a
bit
of
bread
and
a
sweet
characteristic
to
it
near
the
realm
of
molasses
or
a
bittersweet
cocoa
for
flavor
this
brew
starts
off
slightly
roasty
with
just
a
nice
hint
of
dark
fruits
following
there
is
a
light
sweetness
then
a
change
towards
a
more
malty
bread
like
flavor
almost
biscuity
afterwards
there
is
a
nice
rounded
coffee
flavor
which
is
followed
by
a
slight
molasses
the
finish
of
this
beer
is
slighty
bitter
with
a
firm
roasty
balance
the
body
of
this
brew
is
gorgeous
almost
chewy
and
fully
complex
the
carbonation
is
light
but
there
is
no
need
for
any
more
than
is
provided
due
to
the
amazing
flavor
overall
if
you
like
baltic
porters
or
even
just
regular
porters
this
beer
is
clearly
the
king
deep
brown
body
with
a
2
inch
head
of
dark
tan
that
retains
slighty
longer
than
average
scent
is
of
roasted
malt
some
light
chocolate
the
taste
is
wonderfully
rounded
has
a
sweet
malt
body
that
lends
flavors
of
prune
toffee
some
wet
leaves
and
a
really
sweet
finish
with
a
real
chocolate
taste
and
some
coffee
notes
bitterness
is
very
slight
and
the
flavor
really
exudes
a
nice
balance
of
the
ingredients
immensely
quaffable
and
really
enjoyable
the
high
abv
is
hidden
wonderfully
a
great
porter
and
deserving
of
its
reputation
thisll
have
me
back
only
mediumfull
in
body
but
intensely
full
in
flavor
this
is
a
terrific
beer
notes
very
nice
had
a
great
complexity
with
a
smooth
taste
and
roasty
finish
that
was
oh
so
nice
bottle
at
the
moan
and
dove
tar
like
pour
thin
tan
head
fades
quickly
but
it
remains
dark
as
night
powerful
malty
aroma
lots
of
dates
and
grapes
character
but
also
a
considerable
chocolate
cake
portion
and
this
huge
roasted
malt
flakey
counterpart
great
balance
aweinspiring
alcohol
dissimulation
intense
palate
starts
with
big
dates
and
anise
maltiness
it
quickly
lets
room
to
an
extreme
roasty
finish
very
long
like
2
parts
roasted
licorice
and
1
part
cereals
the
sweetness
fades
out
in
total
control
acidity
level
is
maintained
very
low
how
much
dark
malt
could
they
fit
into
a
12oz
a
lot
of
things
going
on
complexity
is
not
disturbed
by
the
great
thick
airy
body
thick
enough
that
the
high
carbonation
appears
just
smooth
and
creamy
it
feels
like
theyve
brewed
it
with
oatmeal
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
sanguineous
black
with
a
minimal
head
a
very
nice
coffee
and
licorice
aroma
wafts
from
this
beer
with
some
undertones
of
currant
or
some
other
dark
fruit
its
not
a
really
overwhelming
smell
just
a
nice
subtle
aroma
this
thing
tastes
just
awesome
it
is
good
when
chilled
but
becomes
leaps
and
bounds
better
as
it
warms
the
flavor
consists
of
licorice
chocolate
sarsparilla
and
toffee
up
front
which
progresses
to
a
roasty
coffee
bitterness
combined
with
a
very
flavorful
hops
profile
the
finish
is
dry
and
surprisingly
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
tad
thin
to
start
but
again
it
becomes
richer
and
fuller
as
the
beer
warms
the
real
kicker
to
this
beauty
is
that
its
7
abv
is
so
well
hidden
i
real
feel
like
this
would
make
as
good
a
session
beer
as
any
ive
ever
head
except
id
be
stupified
after
three
this
is
superb
and
the
best
example
of
this
style
ive
come
across
i
feel
like
it
shares
quite
a
bit
with
anchor
porter
in
flavor
but
steps
up
to
the
plate
where
that
beer
falls
short
completely
deserving
of
its
rating

a

im

an

with
a

almost
a

of

and
lots
of
roasted

toasty
slightly

not

rich
as
the

promises
long
lingering

flavorful
toasty

with

overall
a
solid
beer
i
think
this
is
my
first
baltic
porter
and
it
has
encouraged
me
to
try
more
this
beer
was
much
better
than
anticipated
and
i
recommend
it
highly

excellent
example
of
the

but
i
liked
it
taste
is
more
subtle
than
a
lot
of
chocolate
beers
but
that
could
be
because
its
a
porter
and
not
a
stout
you
do
get
the
bitter
crisp
feeling
from
the
porter
and
not
the
creaminess
of
a
stout
dark
cocoa
powder
and
burnt
mocha
flavors
dominate
i
like
thats
its
not
in
your
face
but
definitely
is
still
chocolatey
maybe
im
a
sucker
for
a
chocolate
beer
or
maybe
the
eaters
have
fallen
victim
to
the
appeal
to
average
bias
i
say
try
this
one
if
you
like
coco
bro
not
amazing
but
not
terrible
either
notes
totally
tastes
like
a
house
beer
i
was
not
impressed
however
if
someone
were
in
need
of
an
introduction
to
dark
beers
this
could
be
a
nice
first
step
for
the
price
i
would
grab
again
overall
hmm
not
a
big
fan
even
as
a
baltic
porter
the
flavor
comes
across
as
too
stale
and
the
mouthfeel
too
flat
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
this
bomber
but
ultimately
i
wouldnt
care
to
have
this
again
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
c
o
i
couldnt
wait
to
finish
it
just
to
get
to
my
next
review
i
dont
really
enjoy
much
of
anything
about
this
beer
especially
for
the
style
they
could
maybe
get
away
with
making
a
dark
lager
perhaps
but
this
is
a
very
poorly
crafted
porter
makes
me
very
sad
to
say
so
despite
my
efforts
as
the
beer
warmed
above
cellar
temp
the
flavors
took
on
a
less
tolerable
character
until
i
finally
had
to
introduce
most
of
the
bomber
to
the
drain
cheap
for
a
reason
cheap
in
cheap
out
o
nope
this
might
be
my
first
failing
beer
not
happy
with
what
i
was
presented
at
all
bought
the
beer
because
of
the
price
at
bevmo
now
i
see
why
it
was
so
low
very
dark
with
brown
edges
and
a
thin
layer
of
tan
bubbles
coating
the
beer
and
sides
of
the
glass
bitter
chocolate
aroma
with
light
roast
and
toffee
creamy
texture
medium
plus
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
its
fairly
bitter
with
mild
malty
sweetness
grassy
with
some
alcohol
and
slight
tartness
present
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
but
the
flavour
seemed
off
to
me
oh
how
we
love
to
jump
on
bandwagons
good
or
bad
i
drank
this
beer
before
reading
any
reviews
wanted
to
see
if
anything
good
comes
out
of
orange
county
first
it
doesnt
taste
like
other
choc
porters
i
will
agree
to
that
but
there
are
a
lot
of
choc
porters
out
there
and
if
you
want
to
copy
one
then
why
bother
what
i
liked
was
the
smoothness
and
sweetness
im
not
a
big
fan
of
heavy
coffee
overtones
and
this
is
really
lacking
in
coffee
but
for
me
that
is
a
plus
its
more
like
milk
chocolate
than
dark
chocaolate
i
like
this
beer
its
lighter
and
ok
for
summer
its
goes
down
easy
for
me
and
i
like
a
change
sweet
instead
of
bitter
ok
if
i
want
a
coffee
or
bitter
choc
ale
then
i
go
with
others
firestone
walkerrogue
etc
this
is
unique
i
will
give
you
that
m
the
60
bottle
reviews
and
only
7
or
so
tap
reviews
it
would
appear
that
it
is
marginally
better
on
tap
but
that
aint
saying
much
d
oh
bayhawk
you
know
how
to
bring
the
fail
this
is
just
a
terrible
terrible
beer
d
pushed
hard
to
get
thru
half
the
bomber
but
the
beer
seemed
to
taste
more
and
more
like
burnt
sugar
free
cocoa
cheers
i
ate
a
rich
chocolate
while
drinking
it
and
that
helped
out
drinkability
is
tenuous
this
is
a
poorly
executed
porter
with
some
serious
flaws
the
cheap
price
makes
it
and
easy
candidate
for
pouring
down
the
drain
and
moving
on
i
made
it
about
a
third
of
the
way
through
the
bomber
before
i
moved
on
i
think
bayhawk
has
a
problem
with
some
of
their
bottled
ales
and
they
seem
to
be
happy
to
leave
them
on
the
shelves
for
the
unwary
to
buy
im
going
to
look
at
my
usual
san
diego
retailers
to
see
where
i
paid
3
99
for
this
this
is
the
second
of
their
beers
i
have
tried
and
it
too
will
water
the
garden
two
hundred
and
fifty
characters
why
punish
the
succinct
below
average
drinkability
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
not
what
i
expected
at
all
and
from
reading
many
of
the
reviews
below
i
see
that
i
am
far
from
being
alone
d
i
finished
the
bottle
easily
enough
but
i
would
not
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
if
the
tangy
taste
of
this
fresh
bottle
could
somehow
be
lessened
then
i
would
consider
it
an
improvement
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
old
bottles
take
on
an
offensively
sour
taste
when
the
fresh
stuff
starts
out
tasting
like
this
drinkability
i
dumped
it
down
the
sink
how
does
this
beer
average
a
grade
of
c
i
concur
with
the
recent
reviews
the
first
sip
tasted
like
vinegar
after
a
couple
sips
it
was
in
the
drain
not
really
sure
how
this
one
ever
came
to
be
bottled
in
the
first
place
coming
out
of
the
bottle
this
looks

the

was
still

the

is

at

i
hope
this
is
a

but
i
dont
plan
on
trying
this

anytime
soon
i
had
to

pour

could
only
stand
a

drinks
of

it

some
of

im

couldnt

regretfully
this
was
too
bad
to
finish
it
is
not
often
i
pour
beer
out
but
i
could
not
drink
this
stuff
notes
from
1507
let
me
start
by
saying
that
i
love
porters
perhaps
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
one
is
a
little
hard
to
stomache
its
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
the
brewer
of
this
beer
intended
to
offend
the
senses
in
such
a
manner
pours
a
dark
brown
but
not
dark
enough
for
a
rich
chocolate
porter
profile
smells
of
overripe
on
the
verge
of
rancid
fruitiness
tastes
similar
to
this
with
a
touch
of
vinegary
ugliness
to
it
ugh
making
my
way
to
the
sink
to
dispose
of
it
tastes
like
a
bad
bottle
but
reading
some
of
the
recent
reviews
leads
be
to
believe
there
is
something
that
has
gone
horribly
wrong
with
either
the
bottling
or
brewing
processes
behind
this
atrocity
i
wasnt
even
going
to
post
this
review
as
i
was
sure
that
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
after
reading
similar
comments
from
others
i
think
its
important
to
notify
other
consumers
of
the
obvious
qc
problems
that
this
brewery
is
experiencing
so
if
you
wish
to
spend
your
hardearned
money
on
this
beer
proceed
with
caution
o
pass
dnot
bad
but
needs
more
boost
in
the
taste
department
and
a
steroid
boost
on
body
easy
drinking
tough
so
this
helps
nothing
offensive
but
certainly
nothing
noteworthy
either
will
not
buy
again
but
might
try
just
to
see
if
my
bottle
was
indeed
skunked
because
of
the
terrible
smell
its
hard
to
bring
this
one
close
to
your
lips
and
therefore
the
drinkability
is
sabotaged
ive
heard
its
a
lot
better
on
tap
so
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
shot
mostly
because
i
cant
believe
a
beer
could
smell
this
bad
and
hopefully
i
just
snagged
a
bad
bottle
overall
though
proceed
with
caution
remember
when
you
were
nine
and
you
would
lick
the
remaining
brownie
mix
from
the
bowl
thats
kind
of
what
this
beer
tastes
like
the
beer
has
a
rich
feel
and
flavor
of
brownie
mix
with
just
a
little
roasted
character
which
is
most
notable
in
the
aftertaste
however
this
is
not
a
beer
that
can
be
consumed
quickly
being
so
sweet
youll
want
to
attack
this
beer
with
small
swigs
andor
a
dessert
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
beer
here
or
what
ordered
from
liquor
max
with
2
misses
of
fedex
deliveries
not
recommended
could
be
a
bad
sample
but
not
recommended
d
gf
brought
this
one
back
from
cali
she
said
on
tap
it
was
great
but
in
the
bottle
it
was
just
missing
something
drinkable
but
not
much
flavor
if
i
order
a
porter
or
stout
i
dont
want
a
watery
weak
tasting
beer
the
thing
that
keeps
this
brew
from
getting
a
lower
grade
is
that
after
two
it
would
be
like
drinking
well
weak
starbucks
coffee
i
paid
3
99
for
this
about
as
much
as
a
starbucks
grande
coffee
though
slightly
more
enjoyable
since
there
alcohol
involved
which
you
cant
taste
which
is
a
plus
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
unless
its
on
tap
for
2
a
pint
sorry
bayhawk
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
not
that
much
pretty
drinkable
for
a
porter
nevertheless
sinkability

i
just
cant
find
a
reason
to
keep
drinking
this
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
american
porter
this
beer
isnt
exactly
sessionable
due
to
its
weird
nature
definitely
compares
to
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
but
not
as
good
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
went
very
well
with
my
meal
though
since
i
wanted
to
compare
it
to
youngs
chocolate
i
should
probably
add
that
i
preferred
the
latter
d
ive
had
this
in
the
past
and
knew
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
im
really
not
quite
positive
im
going
to
finish
this
beer
purchased
park
lane
liquors
lancaster
ca
this
one
seemed
to
miss
in
every
category
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
very
thin
watered
down
hot
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
caramel
the
aroma
here
containted
much
less
roasted
malt
and
much
more
powdered
bittersweet
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
bodied
and
the
taste
was
still
somewhat
sour
but
also
roasty
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
evident
nice
lighter
change
from
a
chocolate
stout
mouth
quite
tart
sour
like
the
smell
but
not
unpleasant
touches
of
chocolate
and
tobacco
fizzy
weak
carbonation
just
as
it
looks
the
mouthfeel
is
very
much
like
soda
very
thin
for
a
porter
not
much
hop
presence
this
brew
displays
a
medium
body
with
minimal
to
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
of
iron
with
chocolate
notes
making
a
brief
appearance
midway
through
the
taste
melding
into
a
weird
bitterness
which
i
cannot
fully
attribute
to
hops
finishes
rather
thin
and
watery
with
an
acidic
tonic
aftertaste
overall
i
am
puzzled
as
to
why
this
is
a
chocolate
porter
when
the
chocolate
is
barely
even
perceivable
marginally
worth
a
try
at
best
mediumlight
body
low
carbonation
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
as
porters
go
kind
of
unfulfilling
smell
preps
you
for
all
this
chocolate
which
is
almost
nonexistent
in
the
taste
based
on
that
i
cant
imagine
much
more
of
this
in
my
future
drinkability
is
poor
this
almost
seems
to
be
a
clone
between
a
porter
and
a
nw
ipa
very
strange
almost
undrinkable
as
it
warmed
as
you
can
tell
by
the
string
of
texas
reviews
it
just
hit
the
shelves
out
here
d
decent
drinkability
mild
porter
chocolate
where
are
you
opinion
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
bold
rich
chocolaty
bitch
instead
i
have
a
thin
dark
ale
with
some
chocolate
flavor
it
doesnt
remind
me
much
of
a
porter
but
i
guess
that
would
be
the
best
place
to
put
it
its
not
gross
or
anything
but
it
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
notes
unimpressive
for
a
chocolate
porter
the
chocolate
is
subtle
it
is
on
the
bland
side
and
the
bitterness
is
too
weak
to
balance
out
the
sweet
malt
body
there
is
way
more
chocolate
flavor
in
fullers
london
porter
and
i
would
buy
the
london
porter
over
bayhawks
chocolate
porter
any
day
of
the
weak
a
thoroughly
disappointing
beer
especially
compared
to
the
solid
california
pa
the
other
bayhawk
beer
ive
tried
chocolate
porter
is
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
smallish
head
the
aroma
is
a
pleasent
mix
of
chocolate
and
roastiness
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
plenty
of
chocolate
flavor
with
an
underlying
roastiness
flavor
also
has
a
bit
of
a
lactoselike
sweetness
the
only
downside
is
a
body
that
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
porter
drinkability
is
very
good
ill
have
to
see
if
any
other
bayhawk
products
arrive
in
texas
black
with
bright
ruby
tones
in
light
abundant
light
tan
head
fades
but
not
too
quickly
smell
of
chocolate
of
the
sweetened
variety
and
burnt
roast
malt
tastes
the
same
good
balance
slightly
sweet
rich
not
overly
carbonated
good
englishstyle
porter
quite
drinkable
notes
im
always
a
sucker
for
this
brewery
their
no
frills
labels
pull
me
in
thinking
hey
finally
a
good
beer
that
i
dont
have
to
pay
for
silk
screens
and
fancy
bottles
then
the
reality
hits
at
the
first
drink
sometimes
you
get
what
you
pay
for
im
ashamed
to
admit
that
i
was
willing
to
paint
the
entire
bayhawk
line
with
the
ugly
brush
after
tasting
just
one
of
their
beers
this
bottle
has
restored
my
faith
temporarily
at
least
in
orange
countys
oldest
brewery
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
bayhawk
beer
that
currently
resides
in
my
cellar
will
at
least
reach
the
bar
set
by
chocolate
porter
if
not
soar
over
it
entirely
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
and
a
short
beige
head
that
quickly
fades
away
nose
is
rather
subdued
but
there
are
faint
notes
of
chocolaty
malts
and
herbal
hops
as
with
the
aroma
the
taste
is
rather
weak
there
are
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
but
in
a
watered
down
sort
of
way
you
have
to
allow
the
beer
to
warm
to
almost
room
temperature
before
the
aroma
and
flavor
seem
to
be
at
a
normal
level
of
strength
worth
a
tryjust
dont
expect
too
much
this
beer
pours
a
dark
auburn
brown
it
has
a
creamy
tan
head
it
fades
quiclky
leaving
few
laces
it
smells
of
chocolate
but
not
as
strongly
as
i
was
expecting
it
also
smells
mildly
malty
it
has
a
light
chocolate
taste
to
it
i
am
a
little
dissapointed
by
the
lack
of
chocolate
flavor
i
have
had
beers
that
didnt
call
themselves
chocolate
beers
with
more
chocolate
flavor
this
beer
is
carbonated
about
right
it
leaves
a
malty
aftertaste
on
the
palate
it
is
medium
bodied
and
not
too
aggressive
this
beer
would
probably
make
a
great
session
beer
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
the
taste
is
not
too
strong
if
you
get
the
chance
and
you
dont
have
any
better
beers
to
buy
you
should
try
this
beer
it
is
about
average
bayhawks
chocolate
porter
delivers
a
slightly
hazy
deepmahogany
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
lighttan
foam
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
the
nose
reveals
some
acetic
notes
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
but
little
more
in
the
mouth
its
thinner
than
might
be
expected
medium
bodied
but
with
a
fine
slightly
restrained
carbonation
that
gently
tingles
the
palate
the
flavor
disappointingly
is
as
the
nose
suggests
its
acidic
upfront
over
a
minor
amount
of
dark
malt
although
theres
not
much
malt
there
at
all
and
the
chocolate
character
only
appears
for
a
brief
moment
at
the
swallow
unimpressive
to
say
the
least
this
is
one
of
the
worst
porters
ive
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
drinking
it
poured
a
decent
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
faded
quicky
and
left
little
to
no
lace
the
smell
was
allmost
nonexistant
but
for
a
very
slight
coffee
scent
the
taste
is
downright
bad
with
a
very
weak
flavor
of
coffee
in
your
mouth
and
one
of
the
most
nasty
sour
finishes
ive
had
in
a
long
time
definantly
save
your
dough
and
get
any
porter
out
there
other
than
this
wow
what
a
disappointment
actually
a
neartotal
dud
this
sad
attempt
at
a
style
i
usually
like
ended
up
cleaning
the
pipes
in
my
kitchen
sink
dont
get
sucked
into
spending
2
50
for
this
brew
when
there
are
so
many
better
beers
out
there
dark
black
color
medium
bodied
aroma
is
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
a
light
bodied
porter
malts
are
roasted
and
choclately
but
it
a
very
lactic
tasting
porter
taste
is
thin
and
watery
not
much
flavor
possibly
infected
not
very
good
either
way
drain
pour
mouthfeel
is
thin
finish
is
dry
aftertaste
is
sour
this
porter
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
with
little
foam
and
some
retention
while
drinking
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
was
average
the
only
set
back
was
not
the
bitterness
but
it
had
a
sour
flavor
that
some
how
took
away
what
pleasant
flavor
it
had
well
balanced
but
the
sour
taste
was
its
down
fall
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
which
settles
quickly
but
leaves
a
good
lace
down
the
glass
aroma
is
roasty
with
mild
chocolatey
notes
quite
sweet
and
pleasant
the
first
sip
was
a
shocker
the
taste
starts
off
extremely
sour
rather
like
an
old
brown
ale
malty
sweetness
kicks
in
mid
palate
maybe
a
weak
milkchocolate
like
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
pleasant
roastiness
all
this
however
seems
rather
insufficient
to
balance
the
sour
start
a
bit
thin
bodied
im
not
sure
what
i
would
think
of
this
on
its
intrinsic
merits
but
the
taste
definitely
seems
wrong
for
a
chocolate
porter
and
definitely
does
not
live
up
to
the
description
posted
on
the
website
chocolate
and
coffee
i
emailed
the
brewmaster
who
confirmed
the
presence
of
the
sour
taste
was
not
due
to
a
bad
batch
but
seemed
to
think
it
wasnt
a
bad
thing
either
to
each
his
own
i
guess
cost
me
2
95
but
there
are
better
chocolate
porters
well
ok
stouts
from
youngs
rogue
etc
that
i
would
purchase
first
coconut
and
cocoa
definitely
show
this
adds
a
lot
of
flavor
to
the
base
beer
bourbon
with
a
little
heat
some
vanilla
the
best
out
of
the
4
i
tried
side
by
side
overall
the
highlight
of
the
framinghammer
series
really
nice
balance
sweet
but
no
where
near
cloying
love
this
beer
not
quite
as
thick
and
rich
as
the
truly
elite
ba
stouts
but
in
some
ways
that
is
a
good
thing
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
lighter
relatively
speaking
of
course
flavors
are
well
balanced
excellent
beer
overall
loads
of
dark
chocolate
some
toasted
coconut
with
a
big
bourbon
wood
finish
a
little
hot
but
overall
very
good
smells
and
looks
great
taste
is
over
the
top
and
cloying
incredibly
difficult
to
drink
this
was
a
phenomenal
beer
ive
never
had
a
coconut
beer
before
but
my
instinct
tells
me
this
would
be
easy
to
screw
up
the
coconut
flavor
mixes
so
well
with
the
coffee
chocolate
and
bourbon
flavors
they
definitely
took
a
risk
by
the
amount
of
coconut
first
the
smell
and
then
the
forward
tasting
flavors
could
have
been
a
disaster
but
its
well
done
great
work
jacks
abby
very
good
the
coconut
is
bit
obvious
and
cloying
but
its
nice
that
its
not
overly
subtle
like
in
other
beers
ive
had
also
melds
great
with
cocoa
nibs
and
bourbon
decadent
mix
of
ba
framinghammer
and
lots
of
toasted
coconut
the
chocolate
is
felt
throughout
perhaps
just
a
bit
more
than
the
regular
but
still
big
the
whiskey
and
oak
only
pulls
it
together
more
with
some
vanilla
sweets
what
a
great
beer
super
complex
and
tasty
while
really
nailing
the
coconutchocolate
flavors
easy
drinker
and
definitely
a
sipper
m
i
think
that
this
is
my
first
beer
that
has
coconut
added
and
it
is
awesome
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
at
least
once
overall
excellent
beer
i
think
the
pbj
still
claims
best
variant
for
me
but
this
was
a
very
drinking
experience
its
reputation
is
well
earned
o
like
the
ba
framinghammer
and
the
other
variants
ive
tried
this
is
a
terrific
beer
unlike
the
others
its
more
of
a
dessert
beer
geared
towards
slow
sipping
ohard
to
judge
which
one
of
these
framinghammers
i
like
the
most
they
are
all
so
close
together
because
the
base
beer
never
becomes
overshadowed
o
interesting
ive
had
the
vanilla
and
coffee
versions
of
this
this
year
and
i
thought
they
were
somewhat
underwhelming
compared
to
last
year
very
little
bourbon
this
year
this
however
is
the
opposite
bourbon
everywhere
from
start
to
finish
maybe
even
a
little
too
much
seems
to
overshadow
the
base
beer
and
the
adjuncts
quite
a
bit
love
this
beer
sweet
and
delicious
could
not
drink
several
of
these
in
arrow
but
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
savor
i
will
stock
up
more
in
my
fridge
another
great
jacks
abby
beer
taste
this
beer
the
3rd
best
framinghammer
variant
of
the
night
probably
o
silky
coconut
is
dominate
and
thick
surprising
that
the
coconut
is
so
forward
in
the
palate
pours
the
color
of
cola
with
a
loose
khakicolored
head
nose
expresses
roast
dark
malts
cocoa
char
and
caramel
taste
is
fantastic
toasted
coconut
really
comes
out
this
beer
tastes
just
like
an
almond
joy
however
there
is
also
a
touch
of
artificial
sweetener
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
however
it
all
comes
off
a
bit
thin
in
the
end
overall
this
is
another
exceptional
framinghammer
variant
not
my
favorite
but
quite
impressive
nonetheless
o
this
is
a
fantastic
barrel
aged
porter
so
much
flavor
from
the
cocoa
nibs
and
coconut
as
well
as
the
bourbon
barrel
a
bit
boozy
but
excellent
none
the
less
o
pretty
good
o
great
addition
to
the
barrel
aged
framinghammer
series
try
the
coffee
and
vanilla
as
well
o
the
coffee
and
vanilla
framinghammer
variants
are
some
of
the
best
baltic
porters
out
there
this
is
on
another
level
so
much
going
on
in
the
smell
and
taste
this
pushes
the
limits
of
baltic
porters
hopefully
they
release
it
again
next
year
because
this
needs
to
be
shared
with
the
world
o
i
love
the
ba
framinghammer
and
all
the
variants
and
this
is
no
exception
the
coconut
is
present
just
enough
to
not
overpower
and
blends
well
with
the
barrel
aged
goodness
glad
i
picked
some
up
m
thick
like
oil
complex
flavor
but
too
much
jelly
outlier
pretty
noticeable
alcohol
and
i
didt
get
any
peanut
butter
a
little
berry
flavor
late
my
least
favorite
of
the
framinghammers
still
really
good
just
more
of
a
j
than
a
pbj
o
this
beer
is
one
of
a
kind
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
pbj
beers
this
doesnt
have
much
peanut
butter
but
the
awesome
jam
taste
and
the
bourbon
crank
this
beer
to
another
level
overall
the
gimmicky
one
of
the
framinghammer
and
easily
the
worst
of
the
bunch
strong
artificial
fruitiness
and
over
sweetness
make
this
beer
almost
undrinkable
appropriate
name
and
the
pbj
is
there
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
grape
jelly
all
the
way
sadly
im
not
a
fan
of
grape
jelly
sad
stuff
i
really
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
but
i
cant
hardly
drink
it
i
keep
hoping
some
warmth
will
aid
its
drinkability
but
it
seems
hopeless
after
a
solid
half
hour
or
so
o
this
was
pretty
good
and
i
waited
6
months
it
could
have
used
another
6
months
to
temper
the
bb
flavor
very
smooth
and
jammy
the
porter
roast
compliments
the
jelly
overall
another
fun
framinghammer
variant
and
one
that
im
thrilled
to
try
but
not
my
favorite
on
the
bunch
the
jelly
parts
of
this
are
too
present
while
inhibiting
some
of
the
finer
elements
of
the
basebarrel
overall
pretty
nice
but
missing
real
peanutbutter
nice
raspberry
jam
and
overall
base
beer
with
chocolate
etc
but
just
missing
the
peanutbutter
serving
type
bottle
enjoyable
and
unique
but
dial
up
the
p
and
dial
down
the
j
in
the
mix
to
make
this
baltic
porter
what
it
could
be
still
recommended
but
a
touch
let
down
these
type
of
beers
are
cool
and
this
is
a
better
version
of
this
style
but
alot
of
jelly
overy
interesting
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
outside
the
box
than
this
beer
is
for
you
i
thought
it
was
very
well
done
but
could
understand
if
this
wasnt
for
you
would
have
liked
a
little
more
peanut
butter
taste
but
overall
this
was
pretty
solid
well
hidden
abv
drinks
like
78
abv
and
alcohol
esters
contribute
positively
to
the
overal
flavor
overall
the
pbj
flavors
are
there
as
long
as
you
like
your
pbj
with
rasperry
jam
which
i
do
hilarious
how
well
it
works
here
the
level
of
flavors
work
nicely
i
really
like
the
residual
barrel
notes
i
think
this
was
a
big
success
but
im
not
sure
the
flavorshere
would
be
to
everyones
preference
i
hope
they
brew
this
variant
again
in
the
future
this
is
delicious
in
spite
of
how
weird
it
is
the
guys
at
jacks
abby
really
blended
these
unusual
flavors
together
well
it
smells
of
bourbon
peanut
butter
and
jam
it
tastes
like
all
of
those
things
fuzed
very
well
into
a
serious
baltic
porter
smooth
mouthfeeljust
delicious
the
reason
i
didnt
give
it
a
five
all
around
is
because
the
peanut
butter
is
strong
at
first
in
smell
and
taste
and
then
is
overcome
by
the
jam
as
the
beer
warms
its
delicious
though
buy
it
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
flavors
arent
really
harmonious
vanilla
subtle
peanut
hint
of
raspberry
smack
of
bourbon
at
the
end
finish
is
medicinal
an
lingers
im
torn
with
this
beer
i
wanted
a
more
peanut
butter
and
jelly
focused
like
no
crusts
and
its
definitely
heavily
barrel
aged
pb
is
heavier
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
aroma
cold
but
gets
light
as
it
warms
jelly
is
subtle
throughout
around
5560
it
gets
to
be
bourbon
heavy
with
subtle
hints
of
pbj
i
want
more
there
already
is
a
barrel
aged
framinghammer
and
coffee
and
vanilla
are
so
strong
torn
damnit
defintely
get
hints
of
peanut
butter
but
the
finish
is
an
awesome
blend
of
chocolate
and
dark
berry
flavors
i
wouldnt
describe
it
as
grape
but
more
like
blackberry
had
after
no
crust
this
is
a
better
beer
lots
of
peanut
in
the
nose
lots
of
kelly
in
the
taste
not
artificial
very
well
intergrated
and
yummy
owhen
its
at
its
perfect
temperature
i
find
that
the
peanuts
are
more
noticeable
in
the
aroma
and
the
jelly
comes
out
more
in
the
flavor
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
absolutely
boss
i
love
barrel
aged
framinghammer
i
love
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwiches
it
seemed
like
a
stretch
but
i
loved
this
beer
farout
zany
and
excellently
crafted
o
welp
certainly
a
unique
combination
and
one
that
was
executed
quite
well
the
bourbon
is
a
little
too
harsh
and
overpowers
the
beer
to
an
extent
but
a
couple
months
of
age
on
this
should
mellow
it
out
raspberry
is
wonderful
and
really
adds
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
to
the
beer
peanut
butter
could
be
a
little
stronger
but
regardless
of
the
nitpicking
this
was
a
nice
unique
take
on
a
delicious
base
beer
o
like
a
bourbon
soaked
pbj
sando
enjoyed
edit
i
tried
a
second
bottle
on
111014
about
5
months
after
the
bottling
date
and
the
only
difference
i
noticed
was
a
slight
bitter
raw
peanut
note
came
through
a
lot
more
as
it
warmed
ill
chalk
it
up
to
my
palate
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
tasted
better
out
of
the
bottle
than
the
sample
i
got
at
the
brewery
very
unique
but
they
really
hit
the
peanut
butter
and
jelly
flavor
on
the
head
worth
a
try
seek
it
out
o
as
a
fan
of
jacks
abby
this
sit
pretty
well
surprisingly
balanced
blend
here
very
complex
flavors
bouncing
off
each
other
very
well
done
without
the
power
of
suggestion
you
could
still
pick
up
pbj
here
i
wish
the
raspberries
came
through
a
bit
stronger
but
the
peanut
butter
flavor
is
very
strong
realtasting
and
awesome
overall
a
fun
beer
to
try
just
if
you
hate
chocolate
and
raspberry
like
my
girlfriend
you
will
be
disapointed
peanut
butter
needs
to
show
more
pours
a
dark
opaque
milk
chocolate
auburn
tinges
and
a
light
tan
head
berry
nose
peanut
malt
dark
fruit
jelly
and
dark
fruit
dominates
flavor
up
front
chocolate
peanut
butter
roast
malt
bitter
finish
thicker
body
low
carbonation
the
flavor
follows
of
peanut
butter
then
chocolate
bourbon
and
then
a
nice
hint
of
grape
jelly
we
had
this
after
cocoanut
and
this
blew
that
out
of
the
water
this
is
an
extremely
successful
flavored
attempt
at
the
ba
base
beer
overall
fantastic
ive
never
had
a
peanut
butter
beer
and
didnt
know
what
to
expect
the
peanut
butter
comes
through
fantastically
being
subtle
enough
not
to
dominate
but
its
presence
is
welcomed
and
adds
substantially
to
the
flavor
profile
the
raspberry
is
very
subtle
but
also
present
and
gives
just
a
little
extra
surprise
to
make
this
something
special
i
had
this
at
the
brewery
and
thought
it
was
great
but
out
of
the
growler
a
little
warmer
this
is
amazing
let
this
one
warm
up
to
get
the
true
experience
m
low
carb
oily
slightly
numbing
alcohol
tingle
in
the
finish
an
interesting
take
on
a
super
imperial
stout
one
of
a
large
number
of
samples
i
had
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
in
boston
32132014
smooth
rich
chocolatey
porter
nice
overall
very
simple
and
straight
forward
very
well
hidden
booze
behind
tart
bitter
dark
fruit
and
a
bourbony
finish
simple
and
to
the
point
a
great
lager
offering
i
would
expect
no
less
from
jacks
abby
pours
a
dark
brown
and
settles
into
the
glass
with
a
very
dark
brown
body
with
some
lighter
brown
at
the
top
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
aroma
is
sweet
sugary
bourbon
caramel
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
with
the
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
coming
through
more
roasted
malts
sugary
bourbon
and
lots
of
boozy
heat
feel
is
very
syrupy
with
low
carbonation
and
a
potent
alcohol
burn
a
solid
barrelaged
porter
but
i
expected
a
little
more
after
how
much
i
enjoyed
bride
maker
overall
not
sure
how
the
alcohol
taste
is
hidden
so
well
in
a
beer
that
clocks
in
at
15
abv
the
sweet
rich
notes
defeat
any
alcohol
aside
from
the
warming
feel
of
the
bourbon
an
absolute
treat
especially
in
the
dead
of
winter
satisfying
surprising
and
yummy
huge
lacing
mocha
colored
head
that
disappeared
very
fast
big
barrel
smell
oak
vanilla
tastes
along
the
same
lines
of
ba
framinghammer
but
ramped
up
and
smoother
at
the
same
time
not
tasting
the
alcohol
but
do
feel
the
heat
in
my
chest
dry
oaky
finish
not
as
much
sweetness
add
youd
expect
from
a
15
beer
very
impressed
this
was
the
first
beer
from
ja
that
disappointed
me
extremely
boozy
as
can
be
expected
from
a
15
beer
with
almost
no
barrel
character
the
mouth
feel
was
very
thin
for
the
style
will
probably
benefit
from
cellar
time
overall
an
awesome
brew
should
definitely
seek
out
and
enjoy
with
only
the
best
of
friends
jacks
abby
has
really
impressed
with
their
darker
bigger
beers
lager
ness
monster
is
just
another
in
a
line
of
big
abv
beers
that
drinks
big
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
that
is
complemented
by
an
exquisite
feel
definitely
worth
trying
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
not
much
head
here
the
color
of
the
thin
cut
of
foam
is

not
much
lacing
first
sniff
holy
hell
this
one
is
a
bourbony
alcoholdripping
monster
pun
lots
of
bourbon
barrel
character
big
rushing
malty
sweetness
almost
smells
like
a
liqueur
roast
brown
sugar
and
sweet
syrup
the
flavor
strikes
with
a
brash
continuous
trio
of

a

i
had
a
large
sample
pour
of
this
one
and
i
think
that
was
the
perfect
amount
its
big
and
bold
but
its
power
didnt
necessarily
translate
to
pleasure
in
my
mind
tons
of
booze
heat
barrel
vanilla
and
oak
flavors
good
roasty
flavors
ok
lager
ness
monster
is
in
enormous
beer
that
reminds
me
a
lot
more
of
a
barrelaged
american
strong
ale
than
a
typical
baltic
porter
this
definitely
has
potential
but
is
far
too
boozy
when
fresh
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
in
a
year
or
two
and
see
how
it
evolves
o
completely
underwhelming
im
very
disappointed
in
myself
for
trading
for
this
the
drinkability
is
very
high
due
to
the
thin
body
lack
of
flavor
and
little
alcohol
presence
but
for
a
15
barrel
aged
imperial
baltic
porter
i
expected
much
more
i
am
extremely
unimpressed
lol
done
again
jácks
abby
good
god
this
beer
will
come
up
and
kick
you
square
in
the
butt
quite
a
strong
beer
this
is
a
sipping
beer
period
i
had
a
taste
of
this
beer
mixed
with
fire
in
the
ham
it
made
both
beers
much
more
drinkable
combined
flat
black
with
no
head
aroma
of
chocolate
coffee
nutty
grain
medium
bodied
creamy
flavor
of
coffee
chocolate
dark

roast

hot
slightly
medicinal
finish
lingering
chocolate
when
gone
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
whiskeydominant
baltic
porter
an
extraordinary
beer
to
just
sit
and
sip
on
a
cold
winter
evening
4
5
tried
a
sample
at
the
brewery
as
i
purchased
8
bottles
taste
is
balanced
sweet
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
a
bit
roasty
and
absolutely
bursting
with
bourbon
flavor
the
alcohol
was
extremely
well
hidden
this
one
tastes
great
but
it
would
probably
be
even
more
amazing
in
a
year
o
not
the
best
porter
for
me
but
really
close
i
certainly
wouldnt
ever
turn
one
away
super
excited
to
try
one
of
the
variants
i
believe
some
vanilla
would
make
this
thing
sing
the
pbj
version
sounds
just
crazy
enough
to
be
excellent
a
good
porter
almost
a
stout
or
imperial
stout
by
taste
and
feel
im
not
convinced
of
the
hype
over
this
beer
the
taste
is
there
complex
with
nicely
complementing
flavors
however
everything
else
is
just
average
worth
trying
but
not
a
standout
among
its
peers
another
really
solid
beer
from
jacks
abby
one
of
the
most
consistent
breweries
around
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
thats
extremely
drinkable
given
the
10
abv
highly
recommended
basic
baltic
some
smokey
malt
flavors
dark
dried
fruits
very
malty
solid
offering
super
roasty
and
robust
chocolaty
sweet
got
a
nice
smooththick
body
drinks
like
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
love
it
great
for
a
cold
winter
night
this
is
an
absolutely
delicious
baltic
porter
on
par
with
some
of
the
best
imperial
stouts
out
there
flavor
really
reminds
me
of
founders
imperial
stout
12oz
bottle
with
mfg
13015
on
the
side
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
small
amount
of
head
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
chocolate
syrup
caramel
molasses
brown
sugar
and
roasted
malts
hints
of
licorice
and
tobacco
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
syrup
with
some
leather
and
tobacco
boozey
some
woody
notes
as
it
warms
finishes
with
more
tobacco
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
syrup
hint
of
coffee
slick
velvety
mouthfeel
really
digging
this
one
im
hoping
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
of
the
variants
overall
fantastic
beer
overall
very
smooth
mouthfeel
sharply
acidic
on
the
front
full
and
roasty
in
the
middle
with
a
lingering
smooth
lagered
finish
exquisite
full
bodied
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
think
i
would
need
to
drink
a
traditional
baltic
in
order
to
truly
appreciate
what
differences
if
any
i
can
detect
from
a
regular
strong
porter
that
said
this
is
a
great
beer
and
the
other
three
bottles
in
my
fridge
wont
last
long
overall
real
enjoyable
bitterness
and
sweetness
play
well
off
each
other
and
work
in
balance
sweeter
flavors
are
quite
pleasant
and
add
an
undeniable
smooth
quality
to
this
beer
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
are
very
forward
and
flavorful
excellent
offering
not
my
favorite
jacks
abby
brew
o
every
jacks
abby
beer
ive
had
has
been
amazing
and
this
is
absolutely
no
exception
a
strong
example
of
everything
a
good
porter
should
be
and
and
absolute
joy
to
sip
should
be
on
every
bas
must
try
list
thanks
cp45
for
the
opportunity
a
nearly
black
beer
with
deep
rubybrown
edges
showing
up
only
when
held
close
to
a
bright
light
for
several
seconds
cascading
roils
under
the
tan
three
finger
head
said
head
endures
a
respectable
time
and
lacing
remains
as
time
passes
and
drinking
proceeds
the
aroma
which
is
not
pronounced
is
of
freshlybaked
brownies
the
beers
flavor
is
also
that
of
a
rich
semisweet
chocolate
pastry
accompanied
by
a
very
slight
alcohol
burn
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
a
robust
porter
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
big
porter
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
mouthfeel
is
perfect
could
end
it
there
but
i
wont
nice
easy
flowing
medium
body
that
has
a
nice
carbonation
level
silky
smooth
with
a
nice
dry
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
and
maybe
the
coffee
flavors
as
well
super
drinkable
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
was
10
maybe
high7s
low
8s
but
not
10
awesome
beer
love
it
the
mr
hendler
nails
another
one
the
barrelaged
version
of
this
was
rather
memorable
and
the
base
beer
is
unsurprisingly
tasty
but
i
can
see
why
there
are
many
variations
to
this
it
has
some
unexplained
levels
of
booze
that
work
quite
well
with
other
flavors
bourbon
for
example
this
is
worth
a
try
but
if
i
had
to
choose
id
stick
with
one
of
the
variants
very
dark
but
theres
a
faint
clear
ruby
hue
to
the
beer
when
held
up
to
bright
light
tanbrown
cap
of
fine
bubbles
lots
of
lacing
good
head
retention
chocolatey
aroma
light
burntsmoke
character
cocoa
and
malted
milk
moderate
bitterness
with
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
notes
of
chocolate
caramel
malt
slight
nut
and
fruit
character
bittersweet
finish
creamy
and
smooth
mild
warmth
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
slight
dryness
really
good
and
super
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
of
the
other
variants
taste
is
sweet
darkness
to
start
lactic
sweet
through
the
middle
and
a
roasty
touch
of
acrid
bitterness
through
the
close
with
alcohol
coming
on
strong
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
drinkability
is
scary
easy
wow
makes
me
wonder
how
the
fh
variants
i
have
waiting
can
possibly
be
any
better
ive
loved
the
ba
variants
and
its
a
pleasure
to
see
where
these
beers
began
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
o
ahhh
a
baltic
porter
like
no
other
as
of
this
moment
jacks
abbey
brews
4
out
of
my
top
4
baltic
porters
this
and
the
3
barrel
aged
variants
talk
about
domination
of
a
category
only
thing
that
comes
close
is
maybe
smuttynose
baltic
porter
anyway
great
example
of
the
style
its
not
a
big
stout
like
some
its
a
proper
baltic
porter
nice
fruitiness
nice
toastedroasted
malt
super
drinkability
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
10
brews
ever
just
a
great
brew
only
made
better
by
the
barrel
aging
of
the
variants
an
impressive
baltic
porter
recommendable
o
tasty
smooth
and
warming
nice
for
a
cold
new
england
night
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
ba
variants
are
so
good
i
am
glad
i
had
this
a
few
times
before
reviewing
it
because
it
just
seems
to
get
better
and
better
each
time
jacks
abby
is
the
best
brewery
in
ma
for
a
reason
well
many
reasons
o
another
excellent
beer
from
jacks
abby
the
alcohol
in
this
one
is
a
little
stronger
than
i
like
and
the
couple
imperial
stouts
that
ive
had
recently
compared
favorably
to
this
one
o
smooth
beer
very
solid
baltic
porter
not
extraordinarily
complex
but
very
robust
in
the
flavors
and
characters
it
does
express
cheers
adam
o
a
very
solid
baltic
porter
with
great
balance
and
complexity
the
10
is
very
well
hidden
and
sneaks
up
on
you
definitely
wellsuited
for
the
winter
months
as
well
if
you
liked
the
3
ba
variants
youll
like
this
one
as
well
as
its
definitely
a
solid
base
for
those
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
slight
smoke
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
smoke
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
with
a
nice
smoke
presence
very
tasty
beer
with
additional
flavors
as
it
warms
the
smooth
creamy
body
is
wonderful
oreceived
as
an
extra
so
unsure
about
the
price
but
a
solid
baltic
porter
and
if
it
is
like
other
jacks
abby
beers
it
would
be
worth
the
price
pours
a
beautiful
tan
two
finger
heady
nice
and
frothy
that
rests
just
at
the
top
of
my
tulip
glass
leaves
great
lacing
as
it
settles
down
rather
slowly
smells
lil
roasted
malts
maybe
a
little
chocolate
and
coffee
there
something
else
i
cant
put
my
nose
on
some
sweetness
a
lot
of
roastiness
on
the
taste
very
creamy
dark
chocolate
as
well
thick
enough
to
coat
the
mouth
but
not
too
much
that
its
a
hard
one
to
drink
very
smooth
incredible
that
this
is
10
im
picking
up
a
burnt
marshmallow
taste
at
the
end
i
dont
think
its
overly
complex
but
its
a
very
flavorful
beer
and
an
easy
to
drink
porter
cant
wait
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
this
beer
really
drinks
easily
and
hides
its
abv
very
dangerously
it
could
be
a
bit
more
robust
on
the
flavors
but
a
good
job
at
the
style
the
beer
pours
practically
like
motor
oil
thick
and
black
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
browness
reflecting
back
at
the
eyes
it
forms
a
beautiful
dark
tan
head
of
creamy
small
bubbles
that
settle
around
a
fingers
width
above
the
glass
in
body
the
beers
clarity
is
hard
to
discern
seeing
as
how
it
is
totally
opaque
the
beer
seems
thick
and
viscous
but
clear
of
any
particles
or
cloudiness
but
that
is
just
going
off
of
what
i
saw
pour
into
my
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
magnificent
dark
roasted
coffee
with
a
thick
nuance
of
dark
fruits
like
brown
sugar
and
raisins
plums
and
just
a
touch
of
sweet
cherries
soft
char
and
a
nuttiness
also
make
their
way
into
the
nose
along
with
spicy
licorice
touches
of
caramel
and
toffee
do
blend
in
with
the
coffee
as
the
beer
swirls
around
the
glass
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
initially
sweet
but
then
dries
out
beautifully
into
gentle
coffee
bitters
with
touches
of
dark
fruitiness
and
even
a
light
sense
of
spice
acidity
is
light
to
nonexistent
on
the
palate
alcohol
is
just
an
afterthought
at
the
end
of
the
sip
providing
a
light
heat
and
spice
to
the
finish
which
is
very
impressive
given
the
beers
10
abv
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
bread
but
swiftly
unfurls
into
light
char
rich
coffee
dark
and
bitter
chocolate
and
touches
of
molasses
burnt
raisins
and
brown
sugar
come
to
mind
as
the
sip
hits
the
midpalate
along
with
a
nice
nuttiness
that
i
also
found
in
jacks
evil
brew
and
even
a
touch
of
toffee
on
the
finish
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
sip
is
a
burst
of
spice
blending
a
touch
of
cinnamon
with
licorice
for
a
nice
burst
of
flavor
the
finish
is
strong
but
muddled
the
flavoring
is
peculiarly
light
with
coffee
and
brings
more
spice
light
alcoholic
heat
and
even
a
touch
of
cherry
into
play
on
the
palate
there
is
even
a
bit
of
meaty
flavoring
on
the
end
of
the
finish
almost
like
a
christmas
ham
the
aftertaste
is
more
expected
with
roasted
malt
coffee
and
char
lingering
on
the
tongue
i
love
this
beer
until
the
finish
and
though
it
is
not
awful
the
muddling
has
me
confused
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
full
bodied
and
smooth
velvety
carbonation
of
an
above
average
rate
helps
to
coat
the
tongue
in
softness
as
the
beer
displays
its
chewy
yet
smooth
quality
the
mouth
is
left
wet
all
over
with
a
lingering
roastbitter
tingle
and
a
slight
warmth
in
the
gullet
overall
this
is
a
great
thick
beer
that
is
perfect
for
sipping
in
front
of
a
fire
i
wasnt
quite
as
fond
of
it
as
i
was
of
its
barrelaged
variant
mostly
because
of
the
oddness
of
the
finish
the
flavors
are
not
awful
by
any
stretch
but
merely
peculiar
and
out
of
place
with
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
good
beer
that
gets
even
better
after
sitting
down
in
a
barrel
this
ones
pours
chocolate
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
pillowy
brown
head
the
scent
is
some
roast
and
lots
of
chocolate
the
taste
follows
through
its
a
rich
coffeelike
chocolate
flavor
lots
of
flavor
in
this
one
and
you
get
the
booziness
but
not
a
burning
heat
very
well
crafted
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
true
to
style
with
the
lager
body
starts
with
chocolate
malt
flavor
the
malted
aspects
of
the
darker
more
coffeelike
malts
show
up
in
the
swallow
relatively
thin
body
high
carbonation
long
aftertaste
of
dark
cherry
and
the
aforementioned
mocha
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
despite
the
level
of
it
o
a
special
tasty
and
easydrinking
porter
that
feels
good
just
to
swirl
in
your
mouth
would
like
to
see
this
in
sixpacks
like
hoponius
union
but
that
probably
wont
happen
i
do
appreciate
the
unique
approach
of
european
size
bottles
but
at
nearly
5
a
takehome
pint
this
is
not
likely
to
be
on
many
drinkers
list
of
regulars
nonetheless
this
could
definitely
spoil
me
for
any
other
baltic
porter
o
this
beer
really
delivers
on
the
bitter
dark
chocolate
fix
but
is
a
tad
one
dimensional
fortunately
im
very
fond
of
bitter
cocoa
this
was
pretty
easy
to
put
down
in
spite
of
the
10
abv
overall
nice
but
doesnt
seem
as
high
quality
as
most
of
the
jacks
abby
beers
esp
since
i
had
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
and
it
was
phenomenal
maybe
this
is
a
bad
batch
or
my
taste
buds
are
off
malts
are
nice
but
a
bit
syrupy
nice
crisp
lager
coming
through
decent
hops
to
balance
but
a
couple
slight
flaws
i
think
served
in
a
tulip
nonic
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
base
when
backlit
head
is
a
12
in
thickness
dense
creamy
and
tancolored
and
embedded
with
tiny
pinpricks
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
soapy
slick
with
some
swaths
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
roasted
malts
lager
yeast
and
dark
slightly
vinous
fruits
and
cocoa
taste
follows
nose
however
the
fruit
profile
is
not
overly
assertive
and
melds
with
the
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
there
is
also
an
earthy
hops
bittering
and
a
bit
of
ethanol
more
flavor
than
heat
at
the
back
that
leaves
a
slightly
acrid
aftertaste
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
even
carbonation
and
some
mild
acidity
attributable
to
the
alcohol
overall
a
solid
baltic
porter
with
both
complexity
and
balance
that
said
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
this
young
brewerys
innovation
and
quality
i
find
the
flavor
to
ring
of
mostly
molasses
with
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
i
really
cant
tell
you
if
thats
a
cinnamon
or
a
clove
or
anything
else
but
i
think
of
this
beer
flavor
as
having
hints
of
that
fall
spice
motif
but
with
a
much
stronger
smokiness
it
causes
the
sides
of
the
back
of
my
tongue
to
twinge
a
little
but
the
way
a
good
hot
sauce
causes
your
mouth
to
burn
just
a
little
you
notice
it
but
it
does
not
dissuade
your
next
sip
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
winter
when
i
can
purchase
this
beer
in
a
bottle
odi
love
big
porters
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
jacks
abby
makes
some
awesome
brews
and
this
is
just
another
that
should
be
tried
when
available
o
overal
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
baltic
porter
jacks
abby
continues
to
impress
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
well
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
little
carbonation
definitely
a
nice
baltic
porter
get
it
if
you
see
it
and
live
darker
beer
at
first
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
less
smoky
version
of
their
other
dark
beer
the
smoke
and
dagger
but
after
a
few
sips
the
abv
really
starts
to
sneak
up
on
you
this
is
such
a
wellbalanced
baltic
porter
its
not
in
your
face
with
malt
or
hops
according
to
the
brewery
much
like
all
other
jas
beers
the
beer
is
actually
a
lager
and
not
an
ale
like
most
porters
that
definitely
accounts
for
the
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
of
this
beer
almost
reminds
me
at
least
in
the
sipping
sort
of
way
an
english
barleywine
vs
american
barleywine
in
that
its
not
over
the
top
in
any
area
but
just
right
in
a
good
malty
sort
of
way
just
another
stellar
beer
from
jacks
abby
overall
an
awesome
beer
full
of
flavor
looks
and
smells
great
smooth
i
definitely
hope
to
drink
this
again
very
smooth
interesting
roast
and
slightly
sweet
finish
somewhat
bitter
and
astringent
kind
of
watered
down
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
as
i
drank
it
side
by
side
with
a
few
other
variants
o
dangerously
smooth
really
good
while
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
a
bit
better
if
the
sweetness
doesnt
border
oppressive
theres
excellent
use
of
the
barrel
and
some
good
complexity
though
and
that
is
not
to
say
it
isnt
fantastic
the
barrel
tastes
of
cheap
bourbon
or
whiskey
chocolate
smooth
and
uncarbonated
delicious
mild
chocolate
strawberry
a
mild
bitter
bite
overall
beautiful
rich
and
creamy
beer
with
sweetness
enhanced
from
the
barrel
aging
bourbon
notes
are
quite
forward
and
boozy
but
they
really
do
compliment
the
underlying
flavors
rather
than
overpower
lots
of
layers
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
profile
vanilla
chocolate
molasses
sugar
nuts
earthy
qualities
excellent
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
nice
and
smooth
bourbon
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
very
easy
to
drink
o
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
way
the
coffeenutscoco
flavors
meld
with
the
hops
to
create
a
porter
thats
packed
with
flavors
but
not
at
all
sweet
highly
recommended
superb
really
enjoyed
overall
this
is
an
excellent

this
is
a
huge
beer
but
one
i
can
only
take
in
small

ridiculous
extra

but
perhaps
not
quite
enough
to
handle
the

with
low
plus
carbonation
solid
beer
but
not
sure
i
get
all
the
hype
ive
heard
about
this
and
its
variants
certainly
a
good
beer
but
the
bar
is
pretty
high
for
ba
stuff
these
days
o
sweet
and
sippable
i
enjoyed
it
less
as
it
warmed
but
delicious
nevertheless
o
along
with
shmaltz
brewing
co
s
coney
island
barrelaged
blockhead
an
imperial
bock
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
this
is
one
of
the
few
barrelaged
lagers
i
am
aware
of
another
being
baby
maker
also
from
jacks
abby
this
is
a
massive
beer
that
once
again
proves
that
lager
yeast
can
rightfully
due
the
job
of
ale
yeast
producing
a
bombastic
baltic
porter
or
better
yet
because
of
its
roastiness
russian
imperial
stout
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
creating
a
particularly
satisfying
result
the
barrelaging
is
significant
and
only
enhances
an
already
well
made
beer
think
again
bcbs
and
kbs
4
75
o
boozy
and
strong
in
the
vein
of
bcbs
though
slightly
more
subdued
heavy
and
sweet
bourbon
taste
balance
out
the
dark
roasted
malts
the
barrel
aging
works
wonders
for
the
already
amazing
framinghammer
if
you
like
barrel
aged
dark
beers
this
is
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
highly
recommend
o
terrific
beer
for
what
it
is
do
not
expect
a
monster
thick
heavy
bourbon
flavored
stout
this
is
a
porter
it
is
more
approachable
more
drinkable
and
more
subtle
in
all
its
flavors
and
smells
o
pretty
good
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
prefer
the
style
to
have
more
roast
and
nutty
character
o
ive
had
limited
experience
with
bourbon
barrel
aging
so
i
liked
that
the
bourbon
characteristics
didnt
seem
too
overpowering
the
alcohol
too
was
a
little
bit
more
present
than
i
would
like
i
much
prefer
the
basic
framinghammer
o
loved
this
cellared
this
one
a
little
longer
than
my
last
bottle
and
it
payed
off
little
to
no
boozines
and
while
not
incredibly
potent
flavorwise
extremely
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
nice
work
ja
thanks
cp45
for
the
opportunity
im
a
fan
of
this
one
it
really
hits
on
the
bourbon
flavors
the
only
knock
is
that
it
could
use
more
heft
in
the
body
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
ba
framinghammer
lacked
body
flavor
and
complexity
the
flavors
didnt
go
well
together
ill
rerate
if
i
get
another
bottle
and
its
better
o
this
is
a
very
bourbonfoward
beer
id
like
to
say
how
much
you
like
this
beer
will
depend
on
how
much
you
like
bourbon
but
i
dont
really
think
that
is
the
case
bourbon
isnt
sweet
but
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
bourbon
isnt
chocolatey
but
this
beer
is
in
the
end
its
a
good
beer
but
not
at
all
mindblowing
osolid
ba
baltic
porter
easy
drinking
in
spite
of
the
abv
in
the
end
this
beer
is
damn
good
with
a
ton
of
flavors
coming
alive
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
love
jack
abbys
brewery
definitely
my
favorite
brewers
in
massachusetts
this
beer
feels
stronger
then
the
alcohol
percentage
it
is
nice
coffee
bean
type
liquor
es
not
huge
on
barrel
aged
beer
but
i
like
this
one
it
has
a
nice
dark
look
nice
beer
to
have
and
enjoy
what
it
is

great
beer
excellent
barrel
rendition
of
the
phenomenal
base
overall
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
one
of
the
most
balanced
and
well
done
straight
bourbon
stoutporters
i
have
had
in
a
while
lots
of
bold
alcohol
and
bourbon
but
never
overpowering
or
astringent
o
probably
my
second
favorite
barrelaged
dark
beer
after
kbs
the
bourbon
flavor
is
present
but
by
no
means
dominates
the
beer
jacks
abby
has
really
asserted
itself
as
an
east
coast
brewing
artist
and
this
beer
clearly
shows
the
lofty
heights
of
their
craft
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
quite
boozy
but
enjoyable
too
where
did
that
nuttiness
come
from
strange
but
enjoyable
black
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
almost
immediately
and
cannot
be
revived
even
with
a
swirl
of
the
glass
the
beer
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
a
common
feature
ive
noticed
in
many
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
great
aroma
dominated
by
bourbon
with
notes
of
vanilla
dark
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
follows
suit
fullbodied
yet
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
how
boozy
it
is
the
bourbon
is
up
front
and
on
your
face
which
is
ok
with
me
but
should
be
noted
regardless
i
did
get
tired
of
this
beer
towards
the
end
very
smooth
but
really
hurts
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
add
those
fizzy
bubbles
in
and
this
is
a
winner
without
them
its
still
tasty
but
just
falls
a
little
flat
o
tasty
porter
right
here
right
up
with
my
favorites
o
very
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
typically
i
dont
get
as
excited
by
barrelaging
as
most
but
this
one
beer
where
i
noticed
a
huge
improvement
over
the
regular
version
verdict
gotta
go
with
this
being
an
excellent
beer
not
sure
if
its
the
artistry
or
the
lager
yeast
or
what
but
these
jacks
abby
beers
are
lapping
drinkable
not
a
bad
defining
characteristic
to
have
if
youre
a
brewery
looking
forward
to
the
other
two
jacks
beers
in
the
fridge
my
favorite
beer
to
date
this
is
just
how
i
like
my
stouts
and
porters
this
beer
was
mostly
chocolaty
up
front
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
you
could
taste
the
oak
barrels
throughout
the
aftertaste
was
an
incredibly
pleasant
coconut
flavor
that
left
me
wanting
more
it
was
mildly
carbonated
and
had
a
very
creamy
mouth
feel
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
too
thick
this
is
a
must
try
o
really
liked
the
bourbonvanilla
notes
drinks
pretty
easy
for
10
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
the
coffee
version
o
i
well
done
ba
baltic
i
like
that
i
got
to
taste
a
well
done
version
of
this
o
cant
wait
to
get
a
six
pack
and
age
this
for
6
months
and
try
again
this
beer
is
a
must
try
a
great
drinking
beer
that
is
really
benefited
by
the
barrels
with
a
balanced
complexity
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
great
beer
silky
smooth
rich
flavorful
enjoyable
and
repeatable
i
love
jack
abby
and
its
beers
like
this
that
make
them
one
of
the
most
unique
breweries
in
the
country
taking
lager
to
new
heights
this
is
special
and
in
some
ways
i
like
it
better
than
the
vanilla
edition
it
still
has
a
ton
of
vanilla
to
it
just
naturally
and
from
the
barrel
there
really
is
not
much
need
for
additional
vanilla
matte
black
brown
in
color
thick
but
still
holding
on
to
a
pretty
solid
off
white
head
almost
grey
really
the
nose
is
rich
in
vanilla
notes
and
dark
barley
with
earthy
mineral
density
but
very
little
of
the
bitterness
we
normally
associate
with
dark
brews
like
this
the
oak
from
the
barrel
is
there
and
the
sweetness
of
the
bourbon
penetrates
the
beer
a
bit
too
bakers
chocolate
and
lager
yeast
are
there
too
but
much
more
in
flavor
than
smell
vanilla
and
chocolate
up
front
but
the
only
real
sugar
in
this
appears
to
be
from
the
bourbon
musty
woodiness
is
picked
up
on
by
the
lager
yeast
in
the
finish
giving
this
beer
a
very
unique
character
that
is
both
rich
and
complex
yet
also
sort
of
light
and
drinkable
certainly
for
what
it
is
lots
of
body
through
and
a
longer
finish
than
i
remember
on
most
lagers
but
still
rather
clean
for
its
size
the
flavors
here
are
just
perfectly
proportioned
not
too
much
of
anything
still
grain
first
but
peppered
in
are
all
kinds
of
little
twists
making
this
a
bottle
to
be
shared
and
considered
carefully
very
very
well
done
i
am
very
keen
to
try
the
other
incarnations
of
this
now
this
has
to
be
the
best
american
made
baltic
porter
out
there
if
it
isnt
enlighten
me
but
i
would
be
surprised
taste
is
sweet
darkness
to
start
lactic
and
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
a
peek
of
coconut
and
then
smooths
out
with
some
alcohol
warmth
to
the
close
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
nice
nuances
here
but
liked
the
base
brew
better
again
looks
like
framinghammer
very
dark
with
ruby
highlights
tanbrown
cap
with
lacing
and
good
head
retention
slight
booze
and
wood
on
top
of
the
base
beer
chocolate
and
malt
for
the
most
part
cocoa
and
roast
nice
flavour
sweetness
blends
with
the
mild
boozy
alcohol
and
bitterness
chocolate
and
malt
sit
just
underneath
a
bit
nutty
woody
tannins
follow
through
in
the
finish
mild
astringency
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
not
as
creamy
as
the
other
framinghammers
ive
had
but
still
quite
smooth
quite
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
m
not
as
thick
as
some
bb
stouts
with
a
nice
silkiness
shared
a
bottle
with
my
lady
and
in
hindsight
i
have
a
hint
of
regret
for
sharing
this
beer
looks
good
dark
brown
with
mahogany
edges
tan
had
that
recedes
after
a
minute
or
so
solid
legs
as
one
would
expect
from
a
10
beer
aroma
of
black
malt
anise
toffee
and
pit
fruit
taste
has
bourbon
out
front
with
a
solid
anise
and
a
bit
of
blackberry
rich
mouthfeel
with
a
sweetness
that
is
not
cloying
and
little
to
no
bitterness
very
good
beer
but
a
bit
pricy
at
8
would
like
to
see
this
some
day
in
4
packs
overall
a
real
treat
hides
the
abv
truly
well
reminiscent
of
some
other
lower
abv
barrel
aged
beers
such
as
velvet
merkin
the
oats
and
brown
sugar
are
what
make
this
feel
more
like
a
light
stout
than
a
baltic
porter
creamy
rich
and
smooth
paired
with
bourbon
barrel
aged
maple
syrup
drizzled
bacon
fantastic
foodbeer
combo
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
the
bourbon
element
is
pleasant
but
ultimately
a
little
underwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
a
nice
differentiation
from
the
bbais
genre
as
a
whole
this
beer
might
not
be
mindblowing
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
bba
world
and
shows
a
great
deal
of
craftsmanship

they

who

could
make
something
like
this
baltic
porters
are
a
great
style
and
jas
barrel
aging
here
works
wonders
a
delight
to
drink
o
fundamentally
this
tastes
like
bourbon
was
poured
into
a
porter
the
aroma
is
nice
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
this
feels
pretty
light
bodied
and
drinkable
given
the
10
abv
so
thats
a
plus
really
nice
not
as
great
as
it
was
hyped
to
be
imho
but
has
a
great
balance
and
smooth
flavors
overall
id
grab
this
again
for
sure
nothing
ground
breaking
but
very
well
done
indeed
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
i
actually
didnt
have
huge
expectations
for
it
but
i
want
more
now
the
first
jacks
abbey

to
really
wow
me

beer
a
great
porter
to
begin
with
and
the
barrelaging
just
takes
it
a
step
beyond
overall
im
floored
this
pushes
the
boundaries
of
porter
and
the
bourbon
barrel
is
very
nicely
done
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
o
my
first
experience
with
a
barrel
aged
beer
jacks
abby
continues
to
impress
would
like
to
see
how
the
beer
changes
and
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
varients
overall
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
it
hits
on
all
the
great
parts
a
ba
porter
has
im
a
huge
bourbon
fan
so
this
is
damn
near
as
good
as
goose
island
bcbs
the
more
i
sip
it
the
more
i
want
i
definite
think
if
you
can
get
this
get
it
and
savor
its
amazing
flavors
another
homerun
by
a
brewery
that
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
love
this
one
there
are
some
nights
where
i
want
the
barrel
aged
stoutporter
flavors
but
not
something
quite
as
intense
as
a
bcbs
this
is
where
ba
framinghammer
comes
into
play
awesome
glad
i
have
a
few
bottles
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
these
though
it
will
be
tough
to
not
drink
them
now
overall
this
is
pretty
solid
its
a
little
barrel
heavy
maybe
but
thats
is
excusable
and
it
lacks
a
touch
up
front
but
besides
that
this
is
a
solid
barrel
aged
strong
porter
something
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
masterski
enjoyed
this
one
o
such
a
great
beer
that
it
makes
this
review
boring
it
was
hard
to
describe
but
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
super
mellow
huge
flavor
great
complexity
for
the
style
its
absolutely
incredible
the
taste
really
becomes
a
porter
that
i
expect
it
to
become
dark
burnt
malt
character
on
the
taste
with
a
light
to
modest
bitterness
at
the
finish
it
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
this
is
unexpectedly
lovely
it
comes
close
to
the
line
of
a
bourbon
bomb
especially
as
it
warms
but
it
never
actually
crosses
it
its
a
nice
mix
of
chocolate
and
bourbon
with
a
nice
pinch
of
jacks
abby
goodness
i
cant
say
ive
had
many
barrelaged
baltic
porters
but
i
can
say
that
this
is
better
than
a
lot
of
barrelaged
stouts
i
had
or
maybe
im
becoming
less
jaded
with
bourbon
barrel
aging
in
general
which
seems
unlikely
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
wood
and
slight
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
bourbon
barrel
aged
presence
that
is
slightly
better
in
the
taste
this
is
in
the
running
for
my
favorite
lager
yet
ja
is
tearing
it
up
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
beers
decent
but
lacks
the
general
ja
i
want
to
drink
it
all
the
times
thing
damn
good
for
a
barrel
aged
porter
though
served
alongside
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
with
vanilla
beans
version
the
beer
is
nearly
black
with
an
inch
of
mocha
colored
head
nice
aroma
featuring
bourbon
oak
chocolate
very
tasty
and
quite
smooth
on
the
palate
very
tasty
though
not
as
wonderful
as
the
version
with
vanilla
beans
fairly
low
carbonation
with
alcohol
content
well
hidden
a
delightful
beer
to
sip
black
in
color
but
looks
more
like
cola
when
swished
around
in
the
glass
two
fingers
worth
of
head
on
the
pour
with
decent
lacing
as
you
drink
it
i
smell
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
vanilla
with
some
hops
present
as
well
taste
is
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
which
balances
it
out
nicely
bittersweet
chocolate
some
bourbon
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
take
over
the
entire
beer
it
has
a
nice
chewy
quality
to
it
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
not
hugely
complex
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
for
its
10
abv
thanks
huddyball
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
gem
o
one
of
the
better
ba
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
a
very
solid
base
beer
gets
only
better
with
the
barrel
in
this
case
complex
and
well
nuanced
potent
but
not
overpowering
bourbon
additionno
problem
identifying
this
as
a
ba
beer
but
unlike
so
many
the
barrel
only
complements
the
base
and
doesnt
steal
the
show
bourbon
gives
a
bit
more
bite
and
calms
the
sweet
aspects
of
the
beer
while
the
vanillay
oak
character
really
smoothes
this
out
and
adds
to
its
drinkability
overall
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
not
the
best
barrel
but
it
seems
like
a
really
good
beer
behind
it
d
nice
beer
that
drinks
a
lot
lighter
than
the
listed
10
more
like
a
78
beer
actually
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
variants
for
me
between
the
vanilla
and
coffee
versions
in
flavor
integration
and
enjoyment
o
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
ive
ever
had
even
without
the
wonderful
barrel
aging
attributes
that
the
barrel
provides
surprisingly
not
hot
at
10
plus
the
bb
which
makes
this
all
too
easy
to
drink
a
little
pricier
than
most
ja
offerings
ive
seen
but
that
is
expected
awesome
brew
overall
this
is
excellent
beer
featuring
almost
everything
one
could
want
from
a
barrelaged
porter
and
in
fact
the
flavors
in
here
are
so
nice
that
they
show
up
many
barrelaged
imperial
stouts
but
perhaps
the
best
thing
of
all
is
the
price
for
a
worldclass
beer
my
5
liter
bottle
was
only
5
95
making
this
just
about
the
best
buy
ive
ever
had
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
bba
porter
while
it
is
10
it
is
not
hot
at
all
and
feels
like
less
the
bourbon
doesnt
dominate
the
beer
but
it
is
definitely
there
especially
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
up
more
than
the
other
two
this
one
improves
greatly
as
it
warms
up
and
has
a
lot
more
milk
and
sweet
chocolate
to
it
overall
i
have
this
very
close
to
the
coffee
version
in
terms
of
how
much
i
liked
it
giving
coffee
the
slight
edge
and
with
both
behind
the
vanilla
version
i
dont
think
you
can
go
wrong
with
any
of
the
three
and
think
peoples
favorite
will
just
depend
on
whether
they
like
vanilla
coffee
or
chocolate
the
best
would
love
to
have
it
again
this
is
tremendous
stuff
thank
you
bob
low
b
t
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
upfront
vanilla
brownies
bourbon
and
some
dark
chocolate
the
middle
pulls
the
sweetness
back
a
bit
and
brings
some
charred
wood
burnt
coffee
grounds
and
a
touch
of
booze
finishes
is
just
a
touch
astringent
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
maybe
a
touch
of
anise
mouthfeel
is
lush
and
velvety
theres
not
a
lot
i
would
change
about
this
beer
its
fantastic
i
am
usually
impressed
by
jacks
abbys
beers
but
this
one
was
a
big
disappointment
the
beer
was
thin
in
both
flavor
and
texture
and
seemed
quite
rough
around
the
edges
perhaps
some
age
would
help
round
this
out
drink
a
very
good
barrel
aged
porter
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
jacks
abby
does
it
again
overall
this
is
a
homerun
and
while
i
found
the
nonba
version
to
be
enjoyable
this
is
definitely
a
case
of
the
barrel
improving
the
original
o
this
beer
is
half
way
to
an
amazing
brew
it
drinks
almost
like
a
ba
stout
but
the
booze
taste
is
just
a
little
too
dominant
the
aroma
is
intoxicating
but
it
comes
up
short
in
the
flavor
as
its
so
bourbon
forward
good
but
just
not
great
overall
excellent
offering
from
jacks
abby
delicious
for
all
the
reasons
mentioned
above
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
tasted
overall
jacks
abbey
makes
some
of
the
best
beer
coming
out
of
massachusetts
and
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
that
they
brew
very
complex
oaky
and
chocolaty
without
ever
being
too
overpowering
in
any
area
i
would
certainly
get
this
one
again
oexcellent
baltic
porter
probably
in
the
top
3
best
bp
that
i
have
had
flavors
are
balanced
perfectly
and
the
bourbon
is
present
but
not
overpowering
overall
this
is
quite
good
especially
for
the
price
and
if
you
like
a
good
balance
between
porterstout
flavors
and
bourbon
barrels
you
are
sure
to
enjoy
this
it
is
a
little
on
the
simple
side
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
but
not
too
much
to
complain
about
the
beer
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
nice
had
of
medium
sized
khaki
bubbles
that
settle
down
at
about
a
half
a
fingers
width
which
is
surprising
given
the
beers
10
abv
and
the
fact
that
it
was
barrel
aged
in
body
this
beer
is
impenetrable
to
the
eye
and
the
beers
head
leaves
a
curtain
of
lacing
full
of
slippery
small
bubbles
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
roasted
black
coffee
and
big
boozy
malt
with
touches
of
vanilla
bourbon
and
slight
hint
of
bitter
hops
and
oak
the
bourbon
isnt
huge
in
the
nose
but
it
is
nice
and
blends
well
with
the
malt
of
the
beer
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
boozybourbon
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
bitter
roast
and
some
slight
acidic
bites
in
flavor
this
beer
speaks
of
booze
bourbon
and
roasted
malts
the
flavor
begins
as
sweet
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
honey
but
this
builds
into
practically
cloying
boozy
bourbon
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
coconut
and
a
very
strong
touch
of
alcohol
the
finish
is
bourbon
sweet
and
full
of
boozy
heat
as
it
runs
down
the
throat
and
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
sticky
sweet
with
lingering
bourbon
coffee
and
chocolate
but
also
with
alcohol
hot
in
the
deep
back
of
the
throat
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
smooth
and
velvety
with
just
a
faint
bite
from
the
carbonation
it
is
on
the
light
side
of
heavy
in
body
and
definitely
carries
a
clean
lager
feel
in
the
mouth
where
a
stout
of
this
size
would
have
considerable
grip
and
a
chewiness
this
beer
is
silky
smooth
almost
like
a
fine
hot
chocolate
in
feel
the
mouth
is
however
left
sticky
and
wet
with
a
lingering
heat
burn
from
the
alcohol
this
beer
is
most
certainly
a
sipper
in
case
anyone
was
overlooking
its
10
abv
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
really
a
nice
sipper
and
is
probably
prime
to
drink
in
the
early
winter
when
you
are
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
warmth
from
your
drink
having
just
had
2012s
bcbs
the
other
day
i
can
actually
say
that
there
is
a
similarity
between
the
two
though
not
definitive
framinghammer
is
definitely
of
lager
stock
with
a
beautiful
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
helps
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
and
it
is
also
about
5
less
in
alcohol
than
bcbs
but
it
carries
a
nice
bourbon
heat
and
some
nice
bourbon
flavors
mixed
in
with
thick
malty
flavors
similar
to
bcbs
personally
i
would
advise
sitting
on
a
bottle
of
this
a
little
bit
to
let
the
booze
settle
down
and
so
that
it
is
winter
but
that
would
probably
kill
some
of
the
bourbon
flavors
right
now
im
not
craving
the
boozy
beers
but
i
would
certainly
revisit
this
beer
come
late
fallearly
winter
and
i
would
certainly
sip
it
in
front
of
a
fire
it
is
a
good
beer
and
fantastically
cheap
for
a
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
jacks
abby
has
got
another
great
thing
here
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
coffee
version
of
this
beer
wow
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
some
superbly
drinkable
and
delicious
o
vanilla
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
roasted
maltperfection
this
may
be
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
now
if
i
can
only
get
ahold
of
the
vanilla
and
coffee
versions
o
a
good
beer
overall
the
nose
doesnt
have
quite
the
depth
that
the
flavor
has
but
its
still
very
enjoyable
with
a
nice
mixture
of
barrel
and
baltic
porter
characteristics
m
good
malt
and
bourbon
up
front
very
hot
finish
o
this
is
a
bourbon
drinkers
beer
through
and
through
it
may
come
off
a
bit
strongly
to
those
who
dont
normally
partake
not
the
most
complex
beer
of
its
kind
but
theres
a
lot
to
like
about
it
pour
is
oily
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
the
nose
is
big
and
rich
with
a
roasty
with
light
charred
wood
rich
dark
chocolate
and
cake
batter
taste
is
strong
caramel
rich
chocolate
cake
and
light
charred
barrel
dry
finish
creamy
body
and
soft
palate
a
great
beer
just
under
world
class
overall
id
say
not
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
jacks
abby
but
something
i
would
happily
drink
again
overall
this
beer
was
even
more
impressive
than
the
abcs
had
before
it
delicious
wow
what
the
hell
is
this
thing
its
damn
delicious
is
what
it
is
sweet
bourbon
notes
up
front
with
decadent
chocolate
malts
runs
into
oaky
barrel
notes
and
finishes
suprisngly
bright
and
fruity
huge
thick
body
rolls
over
the
tongue
nicely
how
did
they
get
these
deep
bourbon
barrel
flavors
to
mesh
with
this
bright
fruity
finish
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
10
where
i
think
it
may
have
to
do
with
where
they
got
the
bourbon
barrels
from
as
the
bourbon
flavor
is
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
i
had
this
beer
last
year
at
the
first
anniversary
party
i
like
this
years
baltic
porter
even
more
last
year
i
thought
the
beer
was
excellent
and
looked
forward
to
it
this
year
there
is
an
added
complexity
more
bourbonvanilla
character
my
balloon
glass
brought
out
the
tasting
notes
to
their
fullest
o
its
a
good
good
baltic
one
of
my
favorites
no
reason
not
to
try
this
if
you
can
get
it
poured
out
as
a
nice
black
color
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
on
top
the
retention
is
thin
there
is
also
a
bit
of
scattered
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
good
amount
of
barrel
aged
aromas
there
is
a
subtle
wooden
vanilla
aroma
along
with
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
slightly
spicy
its
males
sense
knowing
they
used
jim
beam
barrels
the
vanilla
notes
and
roasted
malts
wok
well
together
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
good
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
for
10
overall
its
a
great
brew
really
worth
trying
m
full
bodied
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
here
o
great
cold
weather
brew
very
strong
dark
flavors
and
would
pair
excellent
post
meal
or
with
dessert
a
bit
overwhelming
in
flavor
so
id
suggest
sharing
can
be
sipped
like
a
whiskey
or
congnac
drinks
like
an
ris
but
a
bit
cleaner
due
to
lager
yeast
wasnt
quite
as
mind
blowing
as
i
had
hoped
but
far
from
disappointing
given
price
i
would
opt
for
the
non
barrel
aged
version
o
overall
paint
me
impressed
im
a
big
fan
of
porters
and
baltic
porters
but
when
you
stick
them
in
a
barrel
it
really
brings
it
all
together
this
one
is
aged
just
right
and
really
has
such
lush
flavors
another
fine
beer
from
jacks
abby
this
is
a
brewery
to
watch
if
you
arent
already
sold
overall
a
really
great
barrel
aged
porter
for
an
incredible
price
the
barrel
presence
is
really
well
integrated
and
doesnt
overpower
the
base
beer
at
all
really
nice
balance
of
dark
chocolate
roast
and
sweet
caramel
and
dark
fruit
character
definitely
a
great
addition
to
jacks
abby
regular
lineup
definitely
lived
up
to
all
the
growing
hype
overall
this
is
a
killer
beer
supremely
well
balanced
with
its
shades
of
chocolate
coffee
and
bourbon
and
really
delicious
definitely
glad
i
came
across
this
one
i
love
a
chocolateforward
porter
and
this
is
definitely
a
great
example
of
one
ive
been
raving
about
ja
hoppy
beers
but
hot
damn
this
is
good
stuff
o
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
who
enjoys
the
style
and
can
get
there
hands
on
some
i
had
to
go
to
the
brewery
and
im
out
i
western
mass
o
though
i
was
not
that
impressed
with
the
smell
and
look
of
this
beer
the
taste
and
feel
are
really
something
special
this
beer
manages
to
maintain
a
solid
porter
base
that
is
noticeably
lagered
more
so
then
others
but
perhaps
thats
just
because
i
know
it
is
a
jacks
abby
brew
that
being
said
the
chocolate
flavors
that
are
enhanced
with
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
really
add
to
this
beer
that
is
drinkable
and
noticeable
of
its
10
abv
within
the
style
this
definitely
the
best
barrel
aged
porter
i
have
tasted
its
up
there
with
some
quality
ba
stouts
in
terms
of
taste
and
feel
so
as
with
pretty
much
every
jacks
abby
beer
i
recommend
this
ohad
a
tad
too
much
candied
sugar
as
the
beer
warmed
which
threw
off
the
balance
still
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
really
the
only
thing
that
wasnt
mind
blowing
pretty
thin
overall
almost
feels
like
a
baltic
porter
that
was
cut
with
a
shot
of
bourbon
to
thin
it
out
earthy
spicy
and
a
little
hot
at
the
end
carbonation
is
pretty
much
on
point
though
overall
pretty
good
just
not
stellar
like
the
rest
of
it
still
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
another
well
done
beer
by
jacks
abby
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a
baltic
porter
it
has
to
be
the
smoothest
drinking
10
abv
barrelaged
porter
ever
wonderful
variety
of
flavors
with
great
balance
to
boot
nice
contrast
of
ultra
sweet
dessert
up
front
turning
a
bit
bitter
and
acrid
and
drying
in
the
finish
goes
down
very
easily
too
easily
excellently
crafted
as
always
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
with
a
great
mouth
feel
the
oak
and
bourbon
dominate
but
they
mellow
out
with
each
sip
o
wow
definitely
happy
to
have
had
a
bottle
of
this
killer
stuff
world
class
for
sure
first
nonlager
ive
had
from
jacks
abby
but
they
nailed
it
on
the
head
just
a
great
great
beer
treat
to
have
would
love
to
have
it
again
overall
very
nice
a
great
barrel
aged
stout
that
tastes
like
a
dark
chocolate
oatmeal
cookie
with
whisky
infused
great
beer
very
well
done
now
i
see
why
everyone
was
really
pushing
me
to
drink
this
as
i
think
i
will
add
more
to
the
cellar
now
before
its
all
gone
now
i
really
cant
wait
for
the
vanilla
and
coffee
versions
overall
not
quite
a
beer
you
would
drink
after
work
everyday
but
pretty
damn
close
incredibly
smooth
for
10
abv
and
not
a
single
component
overpowers
another
very
well
balanced
even
with
the
prominent
barrel
characteristics
very
flavorful
and
smooth
for
a
10
porter
aged
on
bourbon
impressed
once
again
by
jacks
abby
that
is
getting
redundant
o
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
i
know
baltic
porters
tend
to
warp
the
line
between
ales
and
lagers
but
i
adore
anything
that
jacks
abby
does
and
this
is
no
exception
the
fact
that
they
are
experimenting
with
barrels
now
is
just
too
awesome
plus
the
6
price
tag
is
super
reasonable
just
opened
the
bottle
poured
into
my
hill
farmstead
stemmed
glass
nice
brownish
head
about
one
finger
thick
from
a
pour
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
color
is
very
dark
black
no
light
shining
through
this
beer
on
the
nose
picking
up
a
lot
of
chocolate
which
i
like
on
my
baltics
maybe
some
of
the
bourbon
but
not
much
head
stays
strong
as
it
slowly
recedes
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
first
sip
and
there
is
the
bourbon
not
overpowering
but
definitely
asserting
itself
wow
nice
flavors
as
the
beer
coats
your
tongue
with
dark
porter
flavors
the
bourbon
comes
in
at
the
back
of
your
tongue
mouthfeel
is
a
good
silky
coating
of
the
tongue
i
really
like
this
beer
jacks
abby
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
for
me
on
this
a
very
drinkable
right
now
barrel
aged
beer
very
good
beer
complex
drinkable
for
10
and
well
balanced
a
very
good
effort
by
this
brewer
overall
an
amazing
beer
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
risbaltic
porter
ive
ever
had
no
i
havent
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
some
of
the
more
famous
hyped
ba
beers
but
i
would
be
extremely
surprised
if
they
were
much
better
than
this
i
really
tried
to
be
objective
here
jacks
abby
just
keeps
hitting
home
runs
this
brew
can
easily
stand
with
the
best
of
the
barrel
aged
porters
and
stouts
o
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
bourbon
aged
porter
glad
i
have
a
few
more
as
this
is
crazy
drinkable
yeah
need
to
buy
more
odanother
stunner
by
jacks
abby
one
of
the
better
brews
i
have
had
recently
one
of
their
top
beers
easily
epic
and
for
under
5
dollars
i
need
more
many
more
o
well
my
first
5
given
out
for
any
field
of
the
beer
this
beer
is
very
close
to
being
perfect
i
cant
imagine
how
aging
will
improve
this
so
i
will
probably
drink
more
of
my
stash
sooner
rather
than
later
for
6
per
5l
this
beer
cant
be
beat
price
wise
o
love
this
beer
a
nice
balance
of
bourbon
and
creamy
chocolate
porter
jacks
abby
is
the
next
big
thing
overall
i
genuinely
love
this
beer
im
so
broke
my
girlfriend
and
i
split
a
single
appetizer
while
we
were
there
but
i
couldnt
help
but
buy
a
second
glass
of
this
this
beer
seriously
holds
its
own
even
against
the
heavyhitting
barrel
aged
stouts
i
hope
they
make
more
the
pour
is
black
in
color
with
minimal
head
formation
starts
off
with
some
bourbon
notes
wood
vanilla
etc
followed
by
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
a
light
fruitiness
in
the
background
the
palate
also
features
the
bourbon
nicely
along
with
some
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
fairly
simple
and
straight
forward
but
really
nice
o
this
was
a
very
good
ba
porter
however
im
not
sure
if
it
exactly
lives
up
the
hype
it
has
been
receiving
it
was
definitely
very
flavorful
complex
smooth
and
well
balanced
it
definitely
can
stand
up
to
other
topnotch
ba
porters
and
is
surprisingly
good
for
a
brewery
that
just
celebrated
their
1year
anniversary
i
would
definitely
like
to
revisit
this
beer
in
december
when
they
start
bottling
it
the
beer
definitely
showed
some
nice
wellbalanced
bourbon
characteristics
however
it
might
have
lost
some
of
its
presence
sitting
in
a
keg
for
a
few
months
id
be
interested
to
try
it
fresh
awesome
stuff
world
class
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
jacks
abby
is
really
cranking
out
great
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
tried
a
few
premium
stouts
and
porters
last
night
year
old
gis
bourbon
county
coffee
kate
the
great
and
a
year
old
kbs
thanks
wdarcy77
and
this
one
was
just
as
enjoyable
try
this
beer
its
great
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
and
im
honored
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
a
special
beer
thats
for
sure
i
can
only
wonder
what
the
future
holds
for
this
one
who
knows
where
this
beer
and
its
following
can
go
ill
get
more
if
its
available
its
really
quite
awesome
maybe
one
of
the
best
sipping
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
is
where
i
think
the
rest
in
this
style
miss
the
boat
with
over
the
top
representations
of
the
style
just
a
great
sipping
beer
almost
a
reverse
order
in
taste
profile
booze
in
front
and
not
in
the
finish
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
not
braving
another
sip
this
is
it
this
is
the
real
thing
seriously
oh
my
god
this
beer
is
amazing
ive
been
a
fan
of
ja
for
months
now
and
stop
by
the
brewery
whenever
they
have
a
new
beer
i
have
become
somewhat
of
a
fanboy
and
really
enjoyed
the
original
framinghammer
but
this
bourbon
barrel
aging
just
takes
it
to
another
level
i
mean
seriously
this
beer
can
hold
its
own
any
day
with
the
best
bourbon
stouts
or
porters
out
there
id
go
as
far
as
to
say
this
is
actually
better
than
founders
kbs
or
goose
islands
bourbon
stout
wow
the
bourbon
aging
was
like
the
missing
ingredient
to
perfect
this
beer
if
they
can
get
this
in
bottles
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
sits
permanently
near
the
top
of
the
ba
100
try
this
beer
now
certainly
a
unique
vanillabased
imperial
beer
if
only
due
to
the
fact
that
the
vanilla
flavor
is
so
prominent
throughout
the
experience
drink
this
one
fresh
to
really
get
a
feel
for
what
vanilla
can
do
for
the
flavor
profile
vanilla
is
apparent
with
a
fair
amount
of
bourbon
and
heat
better
than
the
regular
ba
but
still
kind
of
watered
down
truly
excellent
kind
of
alcoholforward
but
its
so
complex
you
will
forget
that
in
the
myriad
other
tastes
wonderful
of
the
three
framinghammers
ive
had
this
one
seems
to
have
the
most
character
i
like
it
i
have
a
few
more
i
have
to
try
but
this
may
be
the
winner
it
isnt
flawless
but
a
year
or
two
of
age
could
change
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
around
these
guys
are
killing
it
i
have
yet
to
have
a
beer
from
them
that
i
disliked
and
this
one
is
my
favorite
the
regular
barrelaged
one
the
nonbarrelaged
one
and
the
coffee
barrelaged
one
are
all
excellent
beers
but
this
one
is
it
for
me
the
imperial
stoutlike
baltic
porter
lager
mixed
with
the
vanilla
sweetness
and
the
slightly
boozy
notes
from
the
bourbon
barrels
make
this
a
perfect
fit
for
a
cold
new
england
night
although
i
also
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
during
hot
new
england
summers
drink
it
age
it
but
buy
it
if
you
see
it
a
little
cloying
aftertaste
knocks
it
down
a
peg
for
me
price
per
oz
doesnt
make
this
a
regular
purchase
by
any
means
but
id
recommend
it
if
its
a
want
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
in
a
horizontal
testing
vanilla
won
66
of
the
vote
as
best
framinghammer
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
luxurious
mouthfeel
and
some
great
sweet
dessert
flavors
o
a
nice
sipping
beer
that
showcases
the
barrel
aging
the
vanilla
is
there
but
not
as
prominent
than
it
is
in
the
aroma
its
good
yeah
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
forthe
whiskey
and
alcohol
nodes
override
everything
else
and
the
vanilla
is
barely
noticeable
im
going
to
let
the
other
bottles
age
a
while
in
the
hopes
that
they
mellow
out
o
a
lot
more
distinctive
than
the
coffee
variant
and
more
bold
than
the
all
three
variants
overall
this
beer
is
rich
warming
and
delicious
perfect
for
a
cold
autumn
night
o
a
delicious
baltic
porter
that
any
vanilla
lover
should
seek
out
it
would
good
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
would
be
best
if
consumed
after
aging
612
months
it
would
mellow
it
out
just
a
bit
more
amazing
brew
period
wonderful
the
beer
in
general
is
quite
oaky
with
a
silk
smooth
chocolate
and
vanilla
pours
a
dark
brown
color
nearing
black
the
aroma
is
big
with
vanilla
bread
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
follows
suit
with
vanilla
which
seems
slightly
muted
by
the
dark
bread
like
lager
yeast
there
is
also
a
bit
of
acrid
smoke
and
pretty
much
tastes
like
a
vanilla
coffee
just
trace
bourbon
and
vanilla
grows
ax
it
warms
the
strength
of
the
beer
cannot
be
tasted
light
bodied
on
the
palate
with
soft
carbonation
a
very
good
overall
brew
nice
base
beer
although
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
it
to
be
vanilla
is
very
much
front
and
center
here
not
just
a
complimentary
flavor
a
good
amount
of
roasty
flavors
as
well
even
a
little
bit
of
smoke
overall
this
works
nicely
enjoyed
it
o
i
think
i
liked
the
coffee
ba
framinghammer
just
as
much
as
this
i
really
need
to
try
more
of
the
ba
framinghammers
these
are
really
good
beers
that
deserve
more
attention
than
they
get
4
25
sweet
beer
a
dessert
beer
richness
of
a
porter
with
the
vanilla
flavorinhs
very
nice
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
light
amount
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
still
leaves
some
creamy
stuff
on
the
side
the
head
is
a
light
brown
color
the
beer
itself
is
a
very
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
that
is
opaque
the
beer
also
has
a
silky
smooth
appearance
the
beer
smell
has
strong
dark
chocolate
notes
and
roasted
malts
the
beer
has
a
strong
vanilla
presence
that
is
very
noticeable
but
not
too
pervasive
the
alcohol
is
also
noticeable
in
the
smell
the
beer
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
beer
smell
however
the
vanilla
is
much
stronger
and
the
notes
mix
very
well
to
create
a
pretty
baltic
porter
the
taste
also
has
that
slight
funk
that
is
typical
of
the
style
but
isnt
very
strong
such
that
itll
turn
people
away
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
heavy
bodied
the
carbonation
is
very
little
and
almost
unnoticeable
overall
a
fantastic
beer
worth
getting
again
i
enjoy
how
strong
and
distinct
the
flavors
are
in
this
brew
o
a
tasty
very
vanilla
forward
though
not
overpowering
porter
highly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
ba
ba
coffee
and
ba
vanilla
beers
o
well
this
is
the
beer
i
was
expecting
when
i
had
regular
ba
framinghammer
but
that
beer
was
an
unbalanced
bourbon
bomb
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
is
well
balanced
smooth
and
absolutely
delicious
thanks
mj0126
for
the
opportunity
o
deliciously
integrated
still
has
a
decent
bourbon
bite
to
it
though
really
good
especially
for
porter
thanks
again
paul
o
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
lots
of
nice
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
going
on
o
tons
of
flavor
with
very
good
vanilla
without
it
being
overly
sweet
o
great
beer
as
mentioned
above
i
only
wish
that
it
had
delivered
more
vanilla
flavors
as
i
think
that
would
have
taken
this
beer
to
the
next
level
still
its
a
phenomenal
brew
and
is
right
up
there
with
the
top
ba
imperial
stoutsporters
overall
great
barrel
aged
beer
good
vanilla
character
and
lots
of
other
flavors
coming
through
i
think
its
just
a
notch
below
the
regular
barrel
aged
framinghammer
but
still
great
an
amazing
variant
great
vanilla
flavor
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
vanilla
bean
bourbon
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
wood
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
mix
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
aspects
all
around
pour
is
dark
brown
almost
black
caramel
to
light
brown
head
nose
smells
like
it
was
barrel
aged
wood
and
bourbon
notes
up
front
with
a
pleasant
light
roast
and
some
rich
malt
goodness
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
cake
notes
with
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
flavor
has
bourbon
up
front
quite
nicely
balanced
more
vanilla
in
the
flavor
well
carbonated
some
fudge
notes
and
touches
of
caramel
never
gets
sweet
has
a
light
roastiness
through
the
finish
good
stuff
im
reviewing
this
under
the
ba
vanilla
framinghammer
listing
as
per
previous
listings
assertions
that
plan
ol
vanilla
framinghammer
hasnt
been
brewed
in
a
while
that
being
said
im
pretty
darn
sure
the
beer
i
am
currently
drinking
never
saw
a
barrel
either
way
black
its
black
coffee
colored
head
tight
bubbles
scant
lacing
nice
looking
porter
aroma
is
of
cacao
milk
chocolat
and
vanilla
its
a
clean
aroma
it
is
an
assertive
aroma
incidently
i
always
find
beers
with
vanilla
to
have
a
bit
of
a
plasticy
quality
in
the
aroma
and
taste
taste
complements
the
aroma
roasty
cacao
married
o
vanilla
like
mexican
chocolate
appropriate
bitterness
is
lent
from
hops
and
roast
this
beer
should
be
more
chewy
but
it
has
a
dense
body
and
a
relatively
clean
finish
with
a
slight
bitter
chocolate
lingering
around
the
tongue
complex
yet
tight
a
notch
above
the
baltic
porter
i
have
the
coffee
up
next
but
its
going
to
be
hard
to
top
this
one
m
medium
to
full
body
creamy
light
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
really
good
and
it
grows
on
you
the
more
you
drink
it
id
say
it
actually
doesnt
feel
very
heavy
sort
of
a
thin
medium
feel
but
the
lingering
flavor
of
a
full
bodied
heavyweight
nice
carbonation
level
and
its
hot
but
not
too
hot
i
guess
well
say
warm
while
being
hot
its
still
close
to
silky
smooth
with
a
nice
woody
and
earthy
finish
great
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abby
notes
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
before
i
knew
it
my
glass
was
empty
then
the
bottle
and
i
nearly
considered
opening
my
second
bottle
o
another
well
done
barrel
aged
version
of
framinghammer
great
base
beer
only
made
better
with
the
barrel
treatments
vanilla
is
noticeable
for
sure
but
not
dominant
everything
works
together
pretty
well
here
lots
of
candy
bar
flavors
in
here
make
this
a
bit
of
a
dessert
beer
jacks
abby
keeps
putting
out
really
great
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
o
these
framinghammer
variants
are
the
real
deal
i
love
vanilla
in
my
beers
and
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
uses
this
is
a
tasty
proud
beer
taste
is
sweet
vanilla
and
dark
maltiness
to
start
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
and
then
cruises
to
the
close
with
vanilla
and
alcohol
slight
numbing
after
swallow
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
nice
subtle
changes
here
a
unique
brew
for
sure
when
i
started
the
beer
i
thought
the
vanillabourbon
notes
really
overruled
the
porter
aspects
but
as
i
sat
on
it
the
combination
really
worked
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
finger
width
light
brown
head
not
as
quick
to
dissipate
but
when
it
did
it
left
a
tiny
ring
around
the
edge
strong
bourbon
and
vanilla
aromas
come
through
up
front
a
touch
of
chocolate
comes
through
as
well
the
taste
is
just
the
same
bourbon
vanilla
and
dark
chocolates
shine
throughout
full
bodied
and
full
of
flavor
a
bit
lightthin
on
the
tongue
with
some
carbonation
overall
a
great
variant
of
an
otherwise
great
ba
baltic
porter
solid
black
color
with
a
smallish
tightly
bubbled
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
wisps
of
foam
on
top
aromas
of
chocolate
chip
cookie
dough
dominate
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
earthy
oak
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
frosting
up
front
but
the
barrel
wood
and
spirits
come
in
quickly
to
squash
that
the
finish
is
a
lingering
brown
sugar
roasted
grain
and
vanilla
affair
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
creamy
silky
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
love
this
beer
complex
clean
and
extremely
flavorful
too
bad
there
wasnt
more
than
one
on
the
shelf
when
i
was
shopping
an
excellent
beer
but
dont
expect
the
same
beer
as
the
barrel
aged
framinghammer
its
quite
different
savor
the
differences
between
this
variant
and
the
original
overall
nice
barrel
aged
vanilla
baltic
porter
not
many
examples
of
a
bourbon

porter
with
vanilla

to
head
i
think
i
preferred
the
coffee
variant
though
this
is
certainly
no
slouch
well
worth
a
drink
oddelicious
but
i
will
say
the
regular
barrel
aged
framinghammer
is
still
essentially
just
as
tasty
easier
to
come
by
and
cheaper
regardless
this
was
10
well
spent
and
a
great
excuse
to
visit
the
brewery
now
on
to
the
coffee
variant
pours
black
with
very
little
head
leaves
a
nice
creamy
tan
film
on
top
with
bubbles
clinging
to
the
side
smells
a
bit
sweet
vanilla
dominates
with
chocolate
and
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
vanilla
is
the
dominate
flavor
of
course
chocolate
and
bourbon
take
a
backseat
to
the
vanilla
but
they
all
mix
really
well
really
happy
this
isnt
too
sweet
really
great
beer
this
is
elite
level
beer
versatile
flavorful
uncompromising
and
its
a
freaking
lager
people
yes
a
lager
indeed
lagers
can
be
wonderfully
rich
esoteric
and
brilliant
beers
and
jacks
abby
continues
to
demonstrate
that
with
each
brew
they
gift
us
with
this
is
a
special
one
and
the
most
remarkable
thing
is
that
its
10
abv
it
drinks
like
4
2
no
kidding
dark
brown
but
not
pushing
black
in
color
lazily
heady
white
and
smeared
all
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
vanilla
is
more
subtle
than
expected
in
nose
but
chocolate
malt
and
oak
char
are
really
out
front
the
smoothness
of
flavor
is
unparalleled
with
bakers
chocolate
and
vanilla
both
contributing
but
being
so
secondary
to
good
old
fashioned
barley
and
yeast
both
of
which
are
familiar
and
comfortable
but
put
together
in
a
way
only
a
master
can
do
its
smooth
of
course
but
its
also
really
clean
and
drinkable
almost
refreshing
the
imperial
stouts
mixed
with
fresca
sort
of
vibe
a
paradox
confusing
but
exceptional
its
bubbly
and
even
refreshing
which
is
odd
for
a
strong
beer
like
this
and
its
lagered
thats
what
we
need
to
remember
here
without
a
ton
of
yeast
finish
i
get
a
clearing
sort
of
oasis
of
cocoa
and
bourbon
as
it
washes
down
i
like
that
vanilla
is
real
backround
so
many
beers
these
days
abuse
the
mighty
bean
but
not
this
one
its
near
perfect
is
so
many
ways
especially
feel
lets
lager
everything
ans
see
what
we
get
its
certainly
unconventional
but
its
a
brewing
philosophy
that
has
yielded
nothing
but
remarkable
beers
and
this
may
be
the
benchmark
for
all
of
them
o
it
is
tough
for
me
to
choose
between
this
one
and
the
coffee
i
give
the
slightest
edge
to
the
coffee
because
it
integrates
so
well
with
the
other
flavors
but
this
one
is
just
as
good
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
in
the
future
overall
better
flavor
than
any
other
aspect
tastes
good
but
it
would
probably
be
better
as
an
ale
the
beer
is
opaque
and
near
black
with
a
half
inch
of
mocha
colored
head
outstanding
aroma
featuring
vanilla
beans
oak
booze
coffee
dark
chocolate
the
vanilla
bean
character
really
begins
to
emerge
as
the
beer
is
allowed
to
warm
absolutely
delicious
so
much
going
on
here
complex
and
wonderful
medium
to
full
bodied
with
relatively
low
carbonation
smooth
on
the
palate
with
minimal
alcohol
presence
a
terrific
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
th
feel
is
nice
and
thick
with
appropriate
carbonation
rolls
over
the
palate
nicely
a
nice
brew
overall
love
the
vanilla
layered
with
the
chocolate
and
whiskey
barrels
everything
just
blends
together
nicely
and
it
makes
me
confident
that
more
world
class
beers
will
be
coming
out
of
central
ma
in
the
future
more
of
a
cheap
vanilla
extract
flavor
than
true
vanilla
d
i
liked
the
vanilla
version
the
best
out
of
the
three
although
theyre
all
pretty
excellent
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
as
i
think
i
could
easily
tackle
an
entire
500ml
bottle
o
very
good
stuff
at
room
temp
this
is
a
pleasant
dessert
sipper
as
with
all
of
these
framinghammer
variants
the
barrel
is
complimentary
and
serves
these
beers
well
this
version
is
somewhere
between
the
regular
and
the
barismo
coffee
version
for
me
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
any
of
the
three
my
girlfriend
liked
the
normal
ba
verions
the
best
and
i
liked
vanilla
best
the
ba
version
is
very
good
but
if
you
really
like
coffee
or
vanilla
youll
probably
like
those
2
versions
slightly
better
after
tasting
and
reviewing
all
four
variants
of
jacks
abbys
framinghammer
baltic
porter
it
seemed
that
this
beer
fell
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
while
it
lacked
the
charred
astringency
of
framinghammer
and
the
booziness
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
framinghammer
the
vanilla
did
not
wow
me
like
the
coffee
flavor
did
in
the
barismo
coffee
version
o
i
dont
know
the
reason
but
the
vanilla
framinghammer
seems
more
balanced
than
the
other
variants
my
favorite
of
the
three
variants
that
ive
had
i
really
love
this
brew
it
can
stand
toe
to
toe
with
any
of
the
big
boy
porters
or
stouts
overall
my
favorite
of
the
ba
framinghammer
family
exceptional
beer
overall
quite
nice
little
boozy
but
great
vanilla
comes
in
nice
with
great
vanilla
bean
and
vanilla
barrel
tons
of
choc
and
pretty
tasty
but
hard
to
tell
how
much
of
an
improvement
over
the
original
the
more
it
warms
the
more
vanilla
i
get
too
o
damn
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abby
i
just
had
the
coffee
version
of
this
two
days
ago
i
would
have
thought
id
like
the
vanilla
version
better
i
dont
even
like
or
drink
coffee
but
i
think
the
coffee
one
beats
this
one
out
slightly
the
coffee
added
a
nice
bitter
contrast
to
the
smooth
sweet
flavors
of
the
base
beer
however
the
coffee
version
was
so
mind
blowing
maybe
if
i
had
reversed
the
order
in
which
i
drank
them
the
vanilla
would
have
really
wowed
me
the
first
time
around
in
any
case
this
beer
is
still
stunning
smooth
sweet
creamy
well
balanced
and
with
great
variety
of
flavors
jacks
abby
keeps
knocking
it
out
the
park
awesomely
crafted
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
what
the
vanilla
brought
to
the
table
wish
the
alcohol
was
as
hidden
as
in
the
base
beer
o
fantastic
beer
and
a
must
try
some
aging
could
mellow
out
the
alcohol
heat
and
there
is
soo
much
vanilla
going
on
i
think
it
will
take
quite
a
bit
before
it
starts
fading
too
much
amazing
beer
and
cant
wait
for
more
overall
great
variation
on
the
original
ba
framinghammer
the
sweetness
and
vanilla
arent
too
overpowering
and
the
beer
retains
its
base
beer
qualities
it
is
fullbodied
and
robust
like
i
expect
from
a
porter
and
i
would
definitely
have
again
o
vanilla
framinghammer
might
be
my
favorite
beer
coming
out
of
ma
right
now
im
a
huge
fan
of
vanilla
and
jacks
abby
does
a
great
job
at
integrating
it
with
the
base
beer
the
vanilla
and
the
dark
fruits
contrast
slightly
but
i
like
the
complexity
and
layering
that
it
gives
it
after
trying
this
im
rethinking
trading
my
other
bottles
overall
ive
used
the
word
balanced
a
lot
in
this
review
but
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
just
that
and
they
combine
to
make
an
excellent
flavor
profile
the
vanilla
only
adds
to
this
beer
and
for
someone
who
prefers
a
slightly
more
chocolatevanilla
dominant
porter
to
a
coffee
dominant
porter
this
one
even
outshines
the
standard
bba
framinghammer
and
the
coffee
flavors
add
nicely
to
this
one
as
well
i
would
imagine
this
one
would
only
get
better
with
age
highly
recommended
similar
to
the
rest
of
them
just
has
a
slight
unpleasant
edge
that
the
others
do
not
pours
a
three
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good

from
colonial

acton
ma
i
have
one
more
framinghammer
to
try
coconut
i
think
but
this
one
is
the
winner
so
far
with
respect
to
flavor
and
feel
o
wow
so
good
i
think
i
had
one
of
these
fresh
once
and
the
year
on
the
shelf
really
pushed
it
over
the
top
cheers
o
a
terrific
ba
baltic
porter
with
coffee
added
reminds
me
of
a
local
favorite
tyranena
devil
over
a
barrel
but
even
better
big
roasty
malty
and
a
little
sweet
this
drinks
like
a
stout
i
was
a
little
skeptical
but
this
is
quite
good
smells
like
cheap
coffee
and
cheap
barrel
this
wasnt
tasty
at
all
good
stuff
just
not
as
great
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
figured
it
would
be
more
smooth
being
a
lager
but
it
is
good
nonetheless
my
brother
has
really
been
coming
through
with
the
goods
lately
so
thanks
man
for
pulling
this
one
off
its
as
good
as
all
the
others
again
blows
me
away
that
its
a
lager
and
although
the
coffee
is
light
on
the
aroma
its
taste
and
contribution
to
the
mouthfeel
are
very
prominent
matte
black
beer
heady
and
thick
inviting
like
a
guinness
really
lighter
head
but
similar
vibe
the
nose
is
mild
on
the
coffee
way
more
barrel
and
lager
yeast
here
vanilla
is
as
prominent
as
it
was
in
the
vanilla
edition
not
sure
how
they
got
all
that
from
the
barrel
but
they
did
in
the
flavor
the
coffee
is
darkly
roasted
earthy
and
bitter
enough
without
being
harsh
its
smooth
and
full
bodied
and
the
booze
is
invisible
i
definitely
feel
it
after
half
a
bottle
though
stunning
in
its
depth
awesome
in
its
slick
richness
and
dry
finish
like
no
other
in
the
feel
the
coffee
does
add
a
little
acidity
but
its
mild
and
actually
helpful
here
the
barrel
is
more
pronounced
in
the
nose
than
the
taste
but
it
definitely
adds
that
sweet
oak
to
an
otherwise
dry
finish
expertly
made
this
is
one
of
the
best
series
in
beer
right
now
great
beer
full
body
for
a
porter
dark
color
not
to
sweet
not
boozy
barrel
on
the
nose
big
coffee
flavor
a
very
dark
shade
of
brown
not
quite
black
in
color
still
a
bit
translucent
around
the
edges
forms
a
smallish
darker
tan
colored
head
that
fades
away
fairly
quickly
leaving
just
a
trace
around
the
edge
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
wonderfully
potent
coffee
espresso
dark
fruits
dark
chocolate
and
alcohol
taste
is
also
pleasant
but
falls
off
a
little
again
there
is
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
a
moderately
sweet
dark
fruits
and
a
rich
maltiness
but
the
flavor
seems
somewhat
thin
presumably
from
the
alcohol
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
lower
carbonation
mild
bitterness
overall
a
very
nice
beer
complex
yet
drinkable
a
great
complement
to
a
chocolatecentric
desert
another
excellent
baltic
porter
from
jácks
abby
ill
definitely
buy
more
and
store
in
my
beer
fridge
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
good
coffee
good
porter
lots
of
good
bourbon
a
little
harsh
the
coffee
does
not
really
shine
through
on
this
compared
to
the
base
but
still
a
fine
fine
brew
o
another
great
variant
harshest
of
the
variants
that
ive
tried
gets
super
boozy
as
it
warms
this
one
is
a
bit
thicker
int
he
mouthfeel
than
the
vanilla
it
is
full
it
has
a
nice
soft
chocolatey
flavor
that
is
enhanced
by
coffee
and
bourbon
breaddy
and
with
some
cold
coffee
to
come
forward
silky
and
a
bit
of
creaminess
lend
this
beer
a
long
lasting
palate
with
not
too
much
bitterness
a
flourish
of
alcohol
dryness
and
bitterness
from
roast
in
the
finish
this
one
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
vanilla
after
all
and
that
gives
it
a
more
unique
character
as
you
drink
warming
in
the
swallow
and
that
is
the
first
hint
of
alcohol
love
framinghammer
really
love
it
with
coffee
overall
id
drink
it
again
and
will
probably
go
to
the
release
again
its
the
best
of
the
4
bottled
variants
i
think
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
real
thick
head
intense
coffee
aroma
nice
mix
of
creamy
and
sweet
with
fudge
mixed
in
flavor
is
dominated
by
coffee
but
is
not
intense
and
is
rather
silky
smooth
good
stuff
thanks
mj0126
for
the
opportunity
edit
apparently
this
is
barrelaged
according
to
the
fine
ba
who
sent
this
to
me
its
now
much
less
surprising
that
there
was
an
oaky
vanilla
flavour
along
with
the
sweet
chocolate
ice
cream
aspects
and
subtle
heat
presumably
from
the
whiskey
o
between
the
vanilla
an
coffee
this
was
favored
by
all
of
us
a
splendid
melange
of
flavors
that
get
to
the
heart
of
what
i
love
in
a
big
dark
barrelaged
beer
i
have
had
better
certainly
but
this
is
a
topnotch
beer
a
great
offering
in
all
respects
probably
the
best
framinghammer
variant
excellent
stuff
poured
from
16
oz
bottle
into
tulip
deep
black
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
gone
quick
lots
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
aroma
but
subtle
all
around
and
balanced
flavor
of
slight
roast
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
a
touch
of
sweetness
really
balances
this
out
suuuper
smooth
mouthfeel
its
phenomenal
so
silky
smooth
and
a
near
gulper
really
a
tasty
brew
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
except
the
cost
to
get
more
of
this
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
coffee
bean
bourbon
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
coffee
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
wood
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
mix
of
coffee
and
bourbon
aspects
all
around
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
big
coffee
porter
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
poured
a
jet
black
with
a
half
inch
light
brown
head
dissipated
with
some
lacing
once
it
goes
down
great
smell
of
bourbon
espresso
oak
and
slight
chocolate
the
flavors
come
through
stronger
on
the
taste
a
great
sipper
full
bodied
and
full
of
flavor
overall
prefer
the
regular
bourbon
barrel
aged
over
the
coffee
and
the
coffee
over
the
vanilla
all
great
brews
o
the
aroma
was
more
impressive
than
the
taste
but
overall
very
good
i
didnt
pick
up
as
much
coffee
as
expected
rather
more
sweetness
that
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
good
full
bodied
but
not
too
heavy
light
to
moderate
carbonation
level
that
leaves
it
fairly
refreshing
especially
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
pretty
smooth
with
a
warm
but
not
too
hot
bite
at
the
end
the
10
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
designed
to
be
a
sipper
but
if
youre
not
careful
this
is
going
to
go
really
quickly
another
nice
job
by
jacks
abby
they
know
what
theyre
doing
on
all
aspects
taste
is
dark
maltiness
to
start
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
and
coffee
and
alcohol
to
the
close
slight
numbing
after
swallow
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
comes
together
nicely
didnt
believe
the
framinghammer
hype
i
have
another
variant
if
that
one
is
this
good
ill
be
a
fullblown
believer
excellent
beer
o
great
beer
love
the
body
on
the
beer
strong
flavors
that
might
mellow
out
with
some
age
alcohol
on
the
nose
is
a
bit
much
thankfully
doesnt
translate
to
the
taste
very
much
still
think
i
like
the
original
framinghammer
the
best

taste
follows

but
is
not
as
rich
and
bold
as
anticipated
that
said
everything
coalesces
together
nicely
without
one
aspect
being
too
assertive
theres
also
a
thread
of
milk
chocolate
that
also
weaves
its
way
into
the
flavor
profile
and
finishes
with
a
robust
roasted

character
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
however
the
overall
representation
comes
off
a
bit
thin
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
beer
really
holds
its
own
not
only
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
out
there
but
also
one
of
the
better
coffeebased
beers
as
well
m
bit
thin
on
the
palate
but
cant
complain
too
much
because
fairly
smooth
from
start
to
finish
o
amazing
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
ive
had
it
makes
me
excited
to
drink
the

a

quite
good
but
the
coconut
in
the
aroma
was
turned
up
a
little
high
in
the
balance
very
rich
body
and
flavor
complicated
malts
of
chocolate
and
some
black
patent
giving
a
definitive
coffee
flavor
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
this
is
particularly
notable
in
the
aftertaste
light
on
the
carbonation
o
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
the
coffee
is
the
dominant
flavor
everything
else
takes
a
back
seat
which
means
this
isnt
as
balanced
or
complex
as
it
could
be
this
is
more
like
a
delicious
coffee
porter
sans
the
barrel
aging
cheers
o
not
as
coffee
forward
as
i
expected
but
thats
actually
a
good
thing
the
beer
strikes
a
nice
balancethough
the
barrel
takes
over
in
the
end
a
sipper
you
absolutely
must
seek
out
if
you
love
a
good
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
o
a
fantastic
offering
i
missed
out
on
last
years
version
but
not
this
time
drinks
pretty
damn
easy
for
a
10
i
love
the
coffee
and
bourbon
blending
but
the
thinner
mouthfeel
brings
it
down
a
tad
down
for
me
overall
an
excellent
brew
and
jacks
abby
continues
hitting
home
runs
nice
job
odthe
framinghammer
family
of
beers
is
exquisite
this
is
my
favorite
one
its
close
though
trying
the
variant
next
to
the
coffee
variant
is
a
good
time
i
personally
enjoyed
this
one
the
most
but
honestly
its
splitting
hairs
jacks
abby
is
a
temple
o
this
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
three
just
barely
beating
out
the
vanilla
the
coffee
really
accentuated
the
base
flavors
and
yet
it
remained
easy
to
consume
glad
i
could
try
this
one
and
share
it
with
everyone

i
also
find
layers
of
butter

that
makes
it
exquisite
taste
is
roasted

coffee

cream
so
rich
without
being
cloying
and

adds
a
nice

extremely
well

imperial
stout
the
most
intense
and
best
oat
stout
ive
had
o
lots
of
barrel
and
coffee
exceptional
d
good
stuff
although
i
think
this
may
be
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
variants
still
its
a
delicious
beer
that
id
happily
drink
again
at
any
opportunity
in
the
future
perhaps
a
bit
more
coffee
would
bump
this
up
to
worldclass
overall
i
enjoyed
this
just
as
much
as
the
barrel
aged
without
coffee
the
coffee
is
almost
too
strong
but
well
blended
o
what
a
fantastic
brew
we
had
all
three
variants
of
the
beer
and
this
one
was
my
favorite
will
be
trading
for
this
soon
o
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
i
liked
it
more
than
the
normal
ba
version
though
not
as
much
as
the
vanilla
one
tons
of
fresh
coffe
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
a
great
coffee
porter
that
continues
to
improve
on
a
great
beer
would
highly
recommend
checking
out
o
extremely
impressive
excellent
balance
of
flavors
and
barrel
the
coffee
is
there
and
tastes
very
fresh
but
doesnt
overpower
the
other
components
this
isnt
quite
bcbcs
mostly
because
framinghammer
lacks
a
boozy
hotness
but
this
is
a
bba
coffee
beer
i
could
drink
all
the
time
unlike
bcbcs
just
awesome
stuff
without
a
doubt
this
is
worth
seeking
out
after
trying
framinghammer
and
bourbon
barrel
aged
framinghammer
and
being
hugely
disappointed
by
both
offerings
this
beer
really
surprised
me
the
addition
of
coffee
really
rounded
out
the
flavor
profile
and
gave
this
beer
the
balance
and
complexity
that
the
other
versions
lacked
o
one
of
the
best
coffee
aromasflavors
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
but
it
seems
like
a
slight
mismatch
with
the
base
beer
though
the
base
beer
is
outstanding
dont
get
me
wrong
i
rank
it
a
little
behind
bourbon
county
coffee
overall
but
still
excellent
overall
i
really
like
the
ba
framinghammer
but
i
liked
this
offering
even
more
incredible
coffee
porter
overall
great
nose
but
that
same
crazy
coffee
grinds
overpowers
the
flavors
and
gets
a
bit
too
bitter
booze
is
a
bit
strong
and
the
coffee
drowns
the
other
flavors
too
much
but
im
still
nitpicking
at
a
great
beer
o
wow
i
thought
the
regular
bourbon
barrel
version
was
amazing
this
is
somehow
even
better
coffee
is
delicious
and
a
wonderful
additional
layer
of
complexity
yet
not
overpowering
like
so
many
coffee
beers
despite
being
so
fresh
flavors
are
very
well
integrated
and
complementary
taste
is
smooth
and
mellow
despite
the
strong
flavors
and
goes
down
so
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
i
cant
find
any
real
flaws
o
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
as
good
as
some
of
the
notes
are
i
still
prefer
the
base
beer
to
these
o
there
is
some
heat
still
so
setting
this
aside
for
maybe
6
months
may
be
ideal
to
ease
that
and
if
you
dont
like
coffee
dominant
brews
that
could
help
as
well
as
a
coffee
fan
i
think
it
is
great
now
but
will
likely
try
to
keep
one
or
two
for
a
bit
just
to
see
how
it
ages
fantastic
brew
and
look
forward
to
the
next
batch
overall
the
beer
goes
down
incredibly
easy
for
10
for
me
personally
the
roasted
coffee
flavor
is
a
bit
dominant
full
disclosure
im
not
a
coffee
drinker
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
wonderful
but
the
regular
bourbon
framinghammer
has
a
lovely
balance
of
flavors
that
the
coffee
beans
seem
to
have
overwhelmed
in
this
variant
that
said
still
great

and

a

i
want
to
really
like
this
beer
but
the
dry
aftertaste
as
it
warms
up
reminds
me
of
cheap
liquor
poured
into
a
tumbler
this
beer
is
a
very
very
dark
brown
with
a
dense
fingers
worth
of
head
on
top
of
it
the
nose
is
disappointingly
weak
but
gives
some
pleasant
sweetness

is
definitely
a
sweet
stout
with

no

what
has

to
me

the
taste
was
very
roasty
initially
giving

to
a

my
my
i
just
looked
at
the
style
a
baltic
porter
the
sites
descriptor
for
the
style
mentions
bitter
and
acidic
but
then
finishes
much
more
nicely
with
chocolate
and
nothing
dry
chocohazelnut
if
anything
feels
great
though
creamy
enough
and

pungent
and
a

cocoa
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly

a

one
of

favorite
beers
over

years
but
it
seems
to
be
changing
ie
getting
cheapened
the
maltiness
and
creamier
textures
of
previous
batches
seems
to
be
declining
it
seems
less
complex
the
beers
aroma
is
full
and
sweet
its
promise
is
borne
out
in
a
flavor
that
while
possessing
dusky
malty
elements
veers
toward
the
confectionary
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweetand
perhaps
simplefor
some
but
i
find
it
fun
and
satisfying
on
a
winter
evening
the
beers
impressive
texture
is
smooth
and
frothy
interesting
i
dont
think
many
people
would
disagree
with
me
if
i
were
to
say
this
is
not
to
style
light
in
color
minimal
roast
no
black
currants
raisins
prunes
late
addition
hops
but
its
still
a

it
just
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
brown
nothing
like
sinebrychoff

or

but
i
still
enjoy
it
on
its
own
merit

here

o
2012
vintage
not
sure
how
age
has
affected
this
as
ive
never
had
it
fresh
im
typically
not
a
fan
of
the
sweetfruity
porter
renditions
but
this
seems
mostly
well
executed
medium
full
bodied
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
and
quite
quaffable
brew
best
by
date
of
aug
2012
so
this
brew
did
well
with
aging
prost
victory
nicely
done
was
it
the
best
in
this
class
no
for
one
i
think
the
bjcp
is
full
of
shit
but
i
used
their
scale
and
this
beer
pass
on
that
except
on
1
even
then
i
think
is
a
decent
beer
not
much
to
say
cheers
oh
i
may
be
overrating
it
cause
i
like
boozy
beers
a
tasty
beer
that
i
am
going
to
try
and
find
a
fresher
bottle
as
i
think
i
may
have
an
older
bottle
but
this
is
still
a
really
tasty
baltic
porter
heavier
alcohol
on
this
at
8
than
i
would
expect
but
a
good
beer
for
these
upcoming
winter
months
for
sure
intense
strong
flavors
of
sweet
roasted
malt
dark
fruits
a
hint
of
smoke
and
intense
long
lasting
dark
chocolate
finish
alcohol
is
strong
as
is
typical
for
the
us
version
of
this
style
actually
i
prefer
the
lighter
lower
alcohol
lithuanian
version
of
baltic

exemplified
by

is
it

its
a

of
the
style
as
described
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
at
best
example
of
the
style
all
the
aspects
of
this
beer
seemed
to
be
much
lighter
then
they
should
be
and
it
didnt
come
together
the
way
that
a
good
baltic
porter
should
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
on
the
lighter
side
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
hold
my
attention
and
one
is
enough
for
me
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
that
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
price
if
this
was
10
i
would
be
very
disappointed
but
i
think
its
priced
reasonably
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
much
lighter
most
of
the
aspects
of
this
beer
were
compared
to
most
baltic
porters
it
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
every
aspect
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
much
rather
have
a
thirsty
trout
porter
and
its
a
way
better
baltic
porter
and
it
costs
less
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
my
friends
all
in
all
this
beer
left
me
wanting
more
and
i
dont
think
it
did
the
style
justice
it
seems
like
victory
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
was
another
miss
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
aside
from
the
good
texture
this
beer
is
kind
of
blah
for
me
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
it
really
doesnt
tickle
my
fancy
the
way
baltic
porters
usually
do
o
a
really
nice
dark
lager
with
plenty
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
especially
given
the
22
oz
format
and
priced
very
well
at
3
99
if
you
like
baltic
porters
id
recommend
trying
this
one
o
i
obviously
need
to
visit
swim
in
and
take
a
sip
of
the
baltic
sea
to
affirm
my
comparisons
ill
get
back
to
this
review
in
the
future
until
then
if
youre
reading
this
buy
this
beer
when
you
see
it
its
a
delicious
beer
by
itself
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
complex
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
and
a
quite
good
one
at
that
a
well
crafted
beer
just
not
one
that
necessarily
appeals
to
me
cant
knock
it
but
probably
wouldnt
get
another
one
would
certainly
drink
it
if
offered
though
i
think
my
mom
would
like
this
if
she
could
drink
it
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
garnet
hue
when
held
to
a
light
there
is
a
khaki
colored
moderate
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
sweet
roasty
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
ash
a
nice
nose
the
flavor
is
roasty
chocolaty
with
a
slightly
ashy
dry
finish
the
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
and
blends
well
with
the
acidity
of
the
malts
there
are
hints
of
the
alcohol
toward
the
swallow
as
well
with
a
long
lingering
bittersweet
roasted
malt
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
drinks
fairly
easy
overall
a
flavorful
complex
yet
not
tiring
beer
well
done
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
intensity
carbonation
that
creates
a
slightly
foaming
sensation
on
the
palate
resulting
mouthfeel
is
primarily
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
ethanol
presence
becomes
noted
by
midpalate
with
warming
sensation
in
the
nostrils
and
later
in
the
back
of
the
throat
it
is
never
particularly
boisterous
or
annoying
closes
out
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
particularly
so
and
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
on
the
tongue
and
lips
im
sorry
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
beer
next
case
will
come
along
shortly
overall
very
drinkable
and
perfect
degree
of
sweetness
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
drinkable
delicious
and
excellently
balanced
between
fruity
and
bitter
utterly
delicious
pretty
decent
brew
not
the
showiest
of
styles
and
this
one
keeps
it
on
the
straightandnarrow
but
its
well
executed
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
porter
in
my
opinion
nice
robust
sweeter
and
darker
flavors
with
hints
of
fruits
and
booze
it
makes
a
great
drinking
experience
overall
and
is
a
beer
i
would
recommend
cheers
beer
appears
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
sunlight
the
head
died
rather
quickly
and
was
offwhite
the
beer
smells
very
malty
and
chocolatey
with
tiny
wisps
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
big
and
full
of
bitter
chocolate
and
cola
it
is
heavy
and
flavorful
on
the
palate
rich
and
creamy
this
beer
is
a
delicious
dark
brew
o
i
was
very
impressed
by
the
full
flavors
in
this
beer
in
my
experience
baltic
porters
have
left
something
to
be
desired
in
this
category
great
sweetness
while
not
being
overwhelmingly
so
i
bump
up
the
overall
category
a
half
a
point
for
the
5
bomber
price
unheard
of
in
pa
for
a
beer
this
good
with
8
5
abv
i
highly
recommend
it
descent
less
roasted
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
than
expected
tastes
a
lot
like
a
wee
heavy
still
good
though
dark
mahagony
color
the
malt
aroma
is
light
has
a
hint
of
cookie
and
caramel
the
hops
are
lemony
and
the
yeast
has
a
tinge
of
cheese
the
body
is
medium
the
texture
is
thick
no
carbonation
and
the
flavors
duration
is
long
sweetness
is
light
as
is
acidity
and
bitterness
perhaps
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
taste
as
well
o
not
too
complex
and
is
overall
a
collection
of
roasted
sugars
and
coffee
what
is
does
have
going
for
it
is
its
easy
drinkability
the
8
5
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
overall
pretty
damn
good
beer
will
drink
again
pretty
good
othis
is
decent
taste
and
aroma
is
more
like
a
normal
porter
expected
this
to
be
more
robust
and
complex
but
it
improves
as
it
warms
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
havent
had
many
baltics
and
i
cant
say
this
blew
me
away
but
definitely
made
well
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
chocolate
taste
and
a
little
less
alcohol
burn
o
great
brew
and
a
good
one
for
colder
months
with
a
hop
kick
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
malty
sweet
some
smokiness
a
touch
of
chocolate
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
worth
checking
out
ive
had
better
baltic
porters
especially
from
the
us
but
its
a
nice
inoffensive
drinking
beer
i
finished
the
pint
faster
than
i
thought
i
would
but
i
am
not
in
a
big
hurry
to
have
another
pull
off
this
keg
would
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
though
overall
it
tastes
good
but
its
not
what
i
expected
at
all
not
a
lot
of
porter
character
in
between
a
porter
and
a
barleywine
without
the
best
characteristics
of
either
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
if
full
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
with
some
dark
fruit
mixed
in
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
coffee
and
chocolate
up
front
with
some
roasted
malt
and
dark
cherries
and
prunes
in
the
background
there
is
also
some
nice
mint
characteristics
in
the
flavor
which
i
really
enjoy
the
alcohol
is
present
but
doesnt
hinder
the
drinkability
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
a
nice
smooth
malty
ale
with
good
appropriate
flavour
for
style
odrinks
easy
as
can
be
for
its
size
tastes
great
and
pairs
well
with
my
favorite
alaskan
foods
smoked
fish
salmon
halibut
game
meat
like
moose
etc
and
being
that
its
on
sale
up
here
now
i
may
grab
a
few
and
see
how
it
does
with
a
year
or
2
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
probably
my
second
favorite
nice
robust
flavor
and
balance
without
the
negative
tendencies
that
others
of
the
style
sometimes
have
i
highly
recommend
this
one
pours
a
dark
chestnut
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
that
dissapates
slowly
to
leave
a
layer
of
cappicino
froth
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
roasted
malts
and
barley
mixed
with
dark
plums
and
milky
chocolatethe
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
medium
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
chocolate
coated
cherriesroasted
dark
maltstoffeeraisinsmilky
coffee
and
finished
with
a
nice
toasty
berry
finish
and
overall
i
quite
like
this
drop
as
its
very
sessionable
for
its
style
and
would
buy
again
definately
its
one
of
those
dark
brews
that
u
could
drink
all
night
cheers
o
pretty
good
i
could
do
with
a
little
less
alcohol
bite
maybe
a
little
better
balance
between
the
sweet
and
roasted
malts
and
then
it
would
be
pretty
damn
good
solid
really
enjoyed
the
subtle
chocolate
notes
creamy
smooth
overall
the
look
kind
of
hurt
this
one
and
it
could
be
a
little
more
forthcoming
in
the
nose
but
this
one
was
tasty
enough
to
be
interesting
bigger
body
helped
out
a
lot
as
well
this
porter
uses
lager
yeast
and
from
my
experience
lager
yeast
moves
an
imperial
porter
closer
to
the
belgian
strong
ale
zone
this
is
a
style
of
beer
i
really
enjoy
so
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
well
but
it
didnt
quench
my
thirst
for
an
imperial
porter
brewed
with
ale
yeast
which
is
the
type
i
enjoy
more
i
think
that
said
this
is
a
quality
brew
in
its
own
right
and
is
worth
checking
out
thanks
again
for
the
trade
kv84
o
a
very
smooth
and
easytodrink
baltic
porter
that
i
would
have
again
certainly
not
the
most
complex
but
nonetheless
a
solid
and
tasty
baltic
porter
with
a
very
good
taste
profile
poured
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
dense
crown
of
tan
bubbles
good
head
retention
and
decent
lacing
roasty
malts
in
the
nose
tones
of
coffee
chocolate
and
leather
taste
of
dark
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
licorice
plums
coffee
and
some
smokey
leather
very
nice
and
complex
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
cheers
there
is
an
odd
taste
in
there
that
is
a
bit
off
putting
for
me
really
to
the
point
that
i
wish
not
to
have
another
i
suspect
that
its
something
with
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thin
for
my
liking
decent
but
not
great
beer
for
a
baltic
porter
with
an
abv
of
8
5
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
great
drinker
it
has
a
light
feel
look
and
flavor
allowing
it
to
go
down
real
easily
while
i
consider
that
a
good
thing
some
folks
may
see
it
just
the
opposite
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
porter
i
still
think
the
best
ive
had
was
stones
smoked
porter
but
this
one
is
definitely
a
fine
ale
im
warming
up
to
the
style
as
well
o
overall
its
a
very
solid
baltic
porter
distracting
me
from
the
american
porters
i
so
easily
and
readily
purchase
and
consume
a
pretty
solid
baltic
porter
definitely
worth
a
taste
if
you
like
the
style
a
pretty
good
baltic
porter
that
finishes
very
nicely
from
the
lager
yeast
id
buy
again
especially
for
a
snowy
night
o
a
solid
porter
at
a
reasonable
price
for
a
22oz
bottle
something
i
plan
to
try
on
draft
next
time
i
visit
their
brewery
another
good
brew
from
victory
and
then
in
very
very
small
letters
and
numbers
enjoy

i
bought
it
in
april
grumble
mumble
are
you
kidding
me
appears
translucent
dark
brown
during
the
pour
black
in
the
glass
short
yellowish
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
not
much
lacing
smells
like
roasted
malt
toffee
caramel
ground
coffee
and
dark
fruit
tastes
like
bitter
chocolate
and
roast
malt
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
toffee
and
grain
slightly
thinbodied
for
the
style
low
carbonation
silky
with
a
bitter
sticky
lingering
mouthfeel
tasty
but
not
the
most
drinkable
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
luckily
the
taste
was
good
enough
to
make
up
for
the
flat
beginning
overall
i
loved
the
flavor
and
this
might
be
my
go
to
beer
when
i
need
a
good
malt
fix
good
price
for
a
bomber
6
drinkability
is
good
and
despite
a
little
lacking
looks
wise
quite
a
nice
baltic
porter
o
this
is
terrific
it
is
delicious
and
a
hell
of
a
bargain
at
5
this
porter
chugged
its
way
out
of
the
bottle
as
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
red
hues
along
the
edges
the
head
was
pretty
thick
looking
for
a
little
while
until
is
settled
down
and
left
just
a
thin
brown
coating
over
top
of
the
beer
the
lacing
wasnt
too
bad
here
kind
of
sporatic
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
old
wood
aromas
some
earthy
and
smokey
aromas
as
well
theres
even
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
is
pretty
good
mostly
of
brown
sugar
and
some
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thicker
side
and
had
a
light
carbonation
just
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
overall
its
not
a
terrible
baltic
porter
but
not
the
best
ive
had
either
many
thanks
to
mdaschaf
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
but
not
completely
opaque
about
1
finger
of
white
foam
that
quickly
recedes
but
stays
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
smell
toffee
some
grainy
notes
with
chocolate
maybe
an
oaklike
quality
taste
definite
milk
chocolate
notes
some
roastiness
nutty
flavors
some
hops
are
present
at
the
end
and
i
get
a
roasted
lightly
bitter
finish
this
is
my
first
baltic
porter
so
im
not
sure
how
to
judge
it
on
style
characteristics
and
will
judge
it
purely
on
taste
and
experience
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
and
with
the
medium
body
this
is
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
drinkablity
at
8
5
percent
i
get
absolutely
no
alcohol
warmth
here
i
would
say
that
this
is
about
5
if
i
didnt
know
better
it
actually
reminds
me
of
ccb
maduro
brown
in
its
nutty
characteristics
more
than
anything
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
would
have
it
again
pours
a
semiopaque
dark
crimson
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
light
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
a
random
distribution
of
lace
spots
forms
here
and
there
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
roasted
dark
malt
dark
fruits
and
some
subtle
smoky
notes
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
pudding
dark
cherries
dark
malts
and
alcohol
a
bit
of
cocoa
nib
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
slight
alcohol
warming
in
the
throat
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
baltic
porter
from
victory
but
nothing
too
exciting
victory
has
come
a
long
way
with
their
beers
when
i
opened
the
bottle
there
was
a
definite
delicious
smokey
aroma
when
pouring
into
a
glass
its
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
darker
thick
head
that
quickly
dwindled
to
nothing
after
a
few
minutes
i
tasted
hints
of
fruits
but
was
mostly
a
roasted
malty
flavor
the
alcohol
percentage
of
this
beer
is
8
5
which
was
surprising
because
it
didnt
at
all
have
a
taste
that
would
have
indicated
this
it
was
a
very
smooth
and
filling
beer
overall
while
this
wouldnt
be
something
i
would
seek
out
it
was
a
beer
that
i
did
enjoy
but
would
not
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
porters
o
touch
sweet
would
pair
well
with
spicy
dry
rubbed
ribs
glassware
tulip
served
ontap
at
the
la
jolla
brewhouse
in
ca
the
beer
was
poured
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
presents
a
darkened
amber
coloring
brown
in
the
middle
with
a
thin
filmy
head
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
nose
with
some
dark
cherry
notes
the
flavor
is
a
bit
cherry
and
a
bit
coffee
and
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
balance
pretty
well
it
tastes
a
little
bit
like
cherry
coke
the
body
is
light
but
syrupy
at
same
time
dark
caramel
and
coffee
on
the
aftertaste
with
a
midlength
linger
to
the
finish
t
a
quick
hit
of
coffee
bitterness
then
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
flavor
with
some
good
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
i
got
used
to
it
and
it
seemed
to
thicken
up
a
bit
as
the
beer
warmed
being
a
bigger
beer
this
is
easier
to
drink
than
one
might
expect
for
the
style
and
the
abv
which
i
attribute
to
it
being
while
not
lacking
in
body
not
overly
filling
and
with
a
flavor
easy
to
swallow
overall
wow
i
cant
believe
how
awesome
this
beer
is
great
flavors
subtle
but
many
and
the
overall
great
price
worth
picking
up
if
you
like
well
masked
high
abv
porters
may
have
to
go
back
and
grab
a
second
dwell
i
drank
this
for
awhile
before
seeing
the
abv
and
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
this
honestly
drinks
like
a
4
beer
i
am
so
amazed
with
how
drinkable
this
is
it
is
definitely
filling
but
wow
so
good
the
tastes
just
become
more
and
more
complex
as
well
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
very
much
i
would
certainly
buy
it
again
and
may
be
a
favorite
porter
for
me
taste
is
soft
and
lightly
sweet
malt
watery
coffee
cherry
some
bitter
hop
presence
balances
things
out
finish
brings
out
the
background
roastyness
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
heat
from
the
alcohol
builds
up
after
several
sips
definitely
a
sipper
d
honestly
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
one
it
feels
very
minimal
to
me
and
the
solvency
seemed
to
build
over
the
course
of
the
drink
sweetness
also
seemed
to
build
over
time
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
one
im
not
likely
to
revisit
pours
dark
dark
ruddy
brown
and
clear
with
a
minimal
head
the
smell
is
quite
nice
reminds
me
of
winter
with
some
alcohol
warmth
roastiness
caramel
molasses
molasses
molasses
tastes
similar
to
its
smell
it
is
sweet
but
not
syrupy
with
hints
of
black
cherry
something
of
a
thinner
body
bubbly
as
opposed
to
frothy
with
a
dark
malt
bitterness
to
it
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
it
warms
the
belly
but
it
would
nice
nice
with
a
little
more
thickness
a
nice
cold
weather
brew
would
buy
again
overall
quite
good
very
complex
it
seems
like
all
of
the
flavors
have
married
well
i
wish
there
were
more
baltic
porters
available
so
i
can
compare
and
see
how
this
falls
within
the
style
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
comes
back
up
with
a
good
swirl
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
amount
of
roast
along
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
mild
chocolate
there
as
well
interesting
taste
brings
forward
quite
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
along
with
a
hint
of
molasses
i
would
guess
that
there
was
some
special
b
used
in
this
quite
tasty
and
the
yeast
is
bringing
a
nice
presence
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
roast
as
well
medium
body
with
lowish
levels
of
carbonation
drinks
really
quite
well
a
touch
of
booze
in
the
finish
i
really
like
this
beer
drinks
quite
well
and
figuring
out
the
style
is
a
bit
difficult
excellent
dhigh
drinkability
for
a
porter
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
through
out
the
night
my
dad
who
does
not
know
that
much
about
beer
said
that
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
hes
right
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
such
a
high
abv
goes
down
smooth
almost
too
smooth
its
8
5abv
is
masked
nicely
not
sure
id
have
more
than
2
at
a
time
but
the
alcohol
is
just
not
persistent
with
this
one
as
far
as
baltic
porters
go
this
one
is
a
winner
in
my
book
d
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
stood
out
this
beer
is
amazing
on
the
mouth
and
under
the
tongue
and
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
i
had
about
22oz
of
this
beer
within
about
15
minutes
and
i
usually
never
do
that
it
was
just
that
dern
delicious
this
was
my
first
experience
with
this
style
i
didnt
even
realize
there
was
a
baltic
porter
style
really
nice
style
though
sweet
complex
porter
flavors
but
with
a
lager
cleanliness
to
the
finish
this
is
a
decent
drinking
beer
for
sure
the
8
5
is
hardly
noticeable
and
therefore
this
can
be
enjoyed
in
mass
quantity
d
um
a
little
boozy
and
sweet
for
me
this
is
lower
than
avg
enjoy
this
on
a
cold
night
with
a
head
full
of
memories
drinkability
a
very
solid
beer
the
hop
presence
is
rather
strong
but
it
is
balanced
pretty
well
with
the
roasty
flavour
profile
a
fuller
body
may
be
nice
this
is
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
thanks
bry
the
hop
presence
keeps
the
weight
down
for
a
porter
i
could
keep
this
glass
full
drinkability
nice
sipper
but
comes
across
as
more
of
a
sweet
doppelbock
as
the
roasted
qualities
are
a
little
too
restrained
not
victorys
shining
moment
but
still
quite
tasty
and
good
to
try
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
averagesize
head
looks
nice
like
an
imperial
stout
but
perhaps
not
as
dark
aroma
is
similar
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
coffeechocolate
in
the
taste
as
well
i
think
it
was
less
bitter
than
i
expected
and
at
8
5
abv
it
seems
surprisingly
drinkable
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
although
as
other
reviewers
have
said
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
this
is
a
good
porter
would
be
a
good
intro
to
the
style
or
perhaps
before
trying
an
imperial
stout
steve
the
flavor
perhaps
doesnt
go
as
far
as
it
could
with
a
baltic
porter
and
it
is
a
bit
over
roasty
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
am
really
impressed
with
baltic
thunder
as
i
have
been
with
all
the
victory
beers
ive
had
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
all
my
favorite
porters
and
baltic
porters
ill
be
buying
more
thats
for
sure
drinkability
i
probably
could
have
finished
this
bomber
on
my
own
loved
it
i
think
this
is
a
really
great
offering
this
is
an
excellent
porter
certainly
one
of
the
better
ive
had
this
year
full
and
delicious
i
would
absolutely
have
this
brew
again
another
solid
beer
from
victory
recommendable
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
this
didnt
let
me
down
most
assuredly
a
sipper
delighted
in
sharing
thoughts
will
i
sampled
this
selection
with
my
best
friend
check
this
beer
out
verdict
delicious
and
worth
tracking
down
i
really
enjoy
victorys
take
on
traditional
beers
they
are
very
innovative
and
put
a
great
spin
on
traditional
germanbelgian
style
brewing
while
i
found
this
beer
to
be
no
different
the
smoke
nuances
are
very
interesting
i
did
not
pick
up
on
the
fruit
notes
i
typically
expect
to
find
in
a
porter
which
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
decent
but
not
exceptional
i
think
i
mightve
enjoyed
it
more
but
in
my
mind
i
was
comparing
it
to
storm
king
and
thats
probably
an
unfair
comparison
still
it
was
a
good
porter
and
hit
the
spot
nicely
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
cheers
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
this
is
still
a
solid
porter
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
very
rich
and
chocolaty
its
no
perkunos
hammer
but
then
again
that
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
all
in
all
very
tasty
totally
worth
taking
beyond
the
best
by
date
drinkabilty
well
its
strong
enough
that
this
22oz
is
enough
for
sure
this
is
borderline
about
as
weak
as
you
get
for
a
baltic
porter
for
its
bitterness
and
kick
great
winter
beer
will
drink
again
d
for
a
baltic
porter
high
the
clean
finish
coupled
with
the
absolute
masking
of
the
abv
makes
it
above
average
for
the
style
served
in
nonstandard
glass
no
head
runny
lacing
color
was
like
that
of
cocacola
the
bar
was
dark
with
a
touch
of
maroon
the
aroma
consisted
of
slight
bitter
hops
coffee
and
overroasted
malts
taste
is
overwhelmingly
coffee
some
toffee
like
that
of
a
heath
bar
but
not
sweet
a
touch
of
caramel
and
slightly
overroasted
malts
only
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
hotness
was
present
this
was
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
hangs
out
in
your
mouth
not
sure
that
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
these
beers
per
season
notes
pretty
good
the
nose
does
not
do
this
beer
justice
not
as
bold
as
some
of
the
better
baltic
porters
out
there
probably
more
akin
to
how
i
imagine
some
of
the
older
recipes
to
have
tasted
darkfruit
tastes
are
prominent
very
malty
and
certainly
complex
in
that
right
but
it
all
seems
to
live
in
the
shadow
of
the
darkfruit
esters
poured
a
pleasing
deep
dark
brown
with
an
almost
nonexistent
head
not
totally
opaque
smelled
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
not
as
bold
as
i
was
anticipating
the
mouthfeel
seemed
thin
it
didnt
feel
like
a
stout
in
my
opinion
as
for
drinkability
it
was
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
while
cold
the
beer
mellowed
as
it
warmed
in
the
mug
but
it
was
not
the
most
pleasing
introduction
to
the
style
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
espresso
crema
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
foam
on
the
nose
its
a
pretty
distant
but
pleasant
group
of
notes
mostly
roasted
malt
and
burnt
coffee
some
dark
wet
grass
on
the
tongue
those
flavors
come
out
much
more
distinctly
a
big
roasted
presence
up
front
with
some
combined
hop
and
roast
bitterness
at
the
back
in
the
mouth
its
a
good
deal
thinner
than
i
associate
with
the
style
but
pleasantly
fuzzy
on
the
way
down
its
plenty
drinkable
and
the
price
isnt
outrageous
an
up
and
down
beer
but
pretty
good
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
could
really
grow
on
me
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
i
enjoy
things
sometimes
differing
from
the
norm
i
wonder
if
this
was
fermented
with
lager
yeast
and
not
ale
yeast
in
the
same
way
i
brewer
my
baltic
porter
because
it
has
the
same
muted
malt
taste
d
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappoint
for
me
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
just
didnt
excite
me
maybe
i
just
have
such
high
expectations
out
of
victory
and
baltic
porters
but
it
didnt
really
merit
a
second
purchase
it
did
hide
the
abv
well
though
d
okay
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
probably
but
im
glad
that
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
d
a
good
overall
brew
the
good
flavors
make
this
an
easily
drank
22oz
bottle
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
and
its
presence
is
barely
shown
baltic
thunder
is
a
very
dark
brown
that
appears
black
but
its
not
you
can
see
some
redness
when
held
up
to
light
either
way
it
looks
like
a
baltic
and
comes
with
a
pretty
foamy
dark
tan
head
up
top
with
slight
stickage
smells
include
deep
roasted
malts
chocolate
peat
licorice
and
some
olde
porter
qualities
very
refreshing
ive
been
staying
away
from
the
dark
beer
lately
and
this
is
a
nice
welcome
back
its
not
very
gooey
thick
like
alot
of
baltics
out
there
the
feel
is
pretty
much
medium
its
not
that
huge
carb
is
no
problem
here
while
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
per
style
the
taste
is
not
chocolate
traces
of
vanilla
cocco
beans
roast
malt
peat
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
some
licorice
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
i
could
probably
drink
two
pints
of
this
stuff
the
lighter
body
makes
for
easier
drinking
here
overall
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
nothing
unpleasant
and
a
lot
to
like
cash
and
wanted
something
decent
to
drink
porters
are
my
least
favorite
style
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
victory
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
mild
on
the
baltic
zest
porter
pour
is
a
weak
head
of
about
a
half
a
finger
between
dark
amber
brown
and
black
nose
of
a
bit
of
coffee
and
brown
sugar
palate
is
a
baltic
understated
by
and
american
porter
sweet
and
warm
but
no
zest
of
baltic
sour
to
clean
the
palate
nice
molasses
a
tad
boozy
which
is
expected
but
the
sweet
isnt
balance
like
a
baltic
with
a
leathery
bitter
sour
earthy
quality
a
nice
twist
at
most
to
some
yes
american
porter
aspects
some
anise
to
make
things
interesting
this
is
a
really
really
good
beer
from
victory
i
cant
believe
ive
never
had
this
before
i
will
definitely
drink
again
and
i
highly
recommend
this
one
like
a
lot
of
reviewers
i
expected
a
bigger
bolder
beer
but
once
i
let
it
warm
up
it
had
lots
of
nuances
and
really
worked
as
a
food
friendly
baltic
porter
not
in
your
face
like
a
lot
of
takes
on
this
style
but
rather
a
classy
big
beer
with
dark
fruit
and
some
chocolate
on
the
finish
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
both
the
aroma
and
taste
im
usually
into
the
style
but
this
is
not
for
me
i
can
tell
its
put
together
well
for
a
desert
type
pairing
but
for
gobbling
during
a
ball
game
it
does
not
fit
save
this
one
for
a
nightcapper
with
some
rich
cake
etc
drinks
well
for
8
5
abv
solid
flavor
profile
quite
enjoyable
considering
the
bottle
indicates
its
nine
months
past
its
prime
its
all
the
more
impressive
delicious
very
rich
with
pleasing
malt
complexities
excellent
for
pairing
with
a
dessert
or
even
as
a
night
cap
that
said
its
a
delicious
beer
whatever
it
is
i
enjoyed
it
considerably
3rd
d
smooth
and
not
overly
complex
i
noticed
hints
of
the
alcohol
now
and
then
but
it
doesnt
show
its
higher
alcohol
content
i
was
quite
surprised
and
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
definitely
drink
it
closer
to
room
temperature
otherwise
youre
not
doing
this
brew
justice
i
dont
know
how
often
i
would
pick
this
up
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
would
rate
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
as
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
and
it
was
an
enjoyable
exploration
of
the
style
a
good
beer
to
use
as
an
introduction
to
porters
i
liked
this
baltic
porter
it
isnt
too
complex
but
it
has
an
all
weather
feel
to
it
if
you
can
find
it
for
under
5
id
say
try
it
out
d
a
very
very
drinkable
porter
this
is
a
smooth
drinker
and
the
abv
is
the
only
limiting
thing
on
this
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
fruity
toffee
dry
chocolate
you
know
not
a
chocolate
bar
but
the
cooking
stuff
flavors
deep
roasts
with
some
astringency
add
depth
the
mouthfeel
is
robust
enough
but
feels
a
little
flat
at
the
end
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
highlights
and
a
fluffy
white
tan
head
aromas
of
dark
and
caramel
malts
hersheys
cocoa
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
good
flavors
here
chocolate
plums
and
molasses
well
balanced
with
the
alcohol
hidden
and
a
nice
dry
finish
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
i
doubt
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
down
another
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
no
hint
of
the
slightly
higher
abv
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
that
i
didnt
take
better
notes
this
was
toward
the
end
of
a
long
tasting
night
so
i
think
i
may
have
been
getting
on
the
drunk
side
i
do
know
that
i
enjoyed
the
beer
quite
a
bit
drinkability
good
overall
impy
porter
to
summarize
if
you
like
oxidized
beer
with
a
ton
of
dark
fruit
character
you
will
like
an
aged
baltic
thunder
if
you
want
more
probably
not
having
tried
this
side
by
side
with
the
perkunos
hammer
there
really
is
no
comparison
this
beer
is
inferior
in
every
possible
way
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
having
again
overall
a
very
tasty
porter
with
a
nice
fruity
character
i
like
the
dark
fruit
character
and
the
bitterness
of
the
roasted
malt
and
hops
the
heavyness
of
this
one
makes
it
a
good
beer
for
the
end
of
the
night
thin
mouthfeel
lacking
body
above
average
drinkability
well
balanced
but
could
use
more
character
d
i
am
in
for
one
every
now
and
then
for
history
but
that
is
about
it
there
is
some
mild
carbonation
that
gives
a
little
bit
of
tingle
early
in
the
sip
but
the
finish
is
smooth
and
almost
creamy
i
dont
doubt
that
there
are
better
baltic
porters
out
there
and
i
may
have
to
return
to
this
one
later
to
rereview
it
to
update
my
evolving
palate
and
understanding
of
the
style
but
for
now
this
is
pretty
darn
solid
and
i
look
forward
to
really
digging
into
this
style
this
is
not
a
bad
place
to
start
lot
of
complexity
in
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
allows
a
bit
of
light
through
at
the
edges
head
isnt
impressive
though
nose
has
roasty
components
with
a
suggestion
of
dark
chocolate
on
the
palate
theres
ample
malt
and
roasted
malt
to
sweeten
things
with
again
some
dark
chocolate
and
some
balancing
hops
overall
im
surprised
of
the
malt
slant
finish
is
roasty
it
isnt
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
the
wife
likes
it
too
which
is
always
a
plus
drinkability
was
high
although
i
would
have
preferred
a
slightly
less
stout
beer
edit
almost
a
year
later
this
one
resembles
an
old
ale
in
some
aspects
leathery
and
fruity
dark
fruits
bottle
home
disappointing
baltic
porter
this
beer
pours
a
translucent
mahogany
with
very
little
head
and
whats
there
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
liquid
looking
more
like
wine
than
beer
theres
so
little
head
that
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
is
an
off
batch
or
something
will
rereview
in
the
future
the
aroma
is
just
ok
for
the
style
its
a
malt
fruity
version
without
too
much
roast
theres
some
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
mix
but
its
mostly
apricots
apples
plums
etc
the
flavor
is
rather
average
sweet
and
lacks
a
hook
theres
just
no
real
oomph
to
the
beer
its
not
bad
per
se
but
a
distinct
disappointment
for
the
brewer
and
style
both
of
which
i
quite
like
normally
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
but
it
also
smells
and
tastes
like
a
smaller
beer
not
sure
what
happened
here
dwith
a
name
like
thunder
i
would
think
the
beer
would
pack
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
overall
a
good
beer
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
to
it
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
brown
with
about
a
finger
of
tan
foamy
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
no
real
lacing
is
produced
the
nose
is
dark
malts
coffee
smoke
molasses
and
chocolate
the
taste
somewhat
follows
with
notes
of
molasses
dark
malts
brown
sugar
light
coffee
maple
syrup
and
some
pine
the
body
is
a
heavy
medium
with
healthy
carbonation
and
a
thick
smooth
feel
leading
to
a
rather
high
drinkability
d
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
ever
had
victory
has
done
better
work
in
the
past
d
very
pleasant
was
worried
this
could
have
been
a
disaster
and
a
drainpour
i
have
had
this
beer
fresh
just
not
recently
its
definitely
earned
a
chance
at
a
fresh
review
this
one
gets
half
a
bonus
point
for
aging
gracefully
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
baltic
porter
style
and
i
like
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
could
really
grow
on
me
knowing
its
history
i
really
wish
i
could
have
tasted
its
predecessor

overall
a
respectable

good

love
the
brewery
this
brew
tasted
a
bit
light
to
me
but
that
also
follows
the
style
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
american
style
porter
i
just
wanted
a
little
more
body
good
brew
though
pours
to
a
real
dark
brown
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
had
great
retention
and
left
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
seems
very
sweet
more
of
a
roasted
malt
with
some
caramel
coffee
and
chocolate
coming
through
an
inviting
brew
for
me
the
taste
is
actually
better
than
the
nose
sweetness
comes
through
more
here
with
the
chocolate
and
carmel
flavor
also
a
slightly
burn
brown
sugar
flavor
i
am
hard
pressed
to
pick
up
coffee
here
though
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
nose
there
seems
to
be
some
dark
fruit
characteristics
that
meld
with
the
sweetness
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
very
smooth
drinking
astringency
is
at
a
minimum
for
me
overall
a
nice
brew
a
good
brew
by
victory
but
it
is
not
the
perkunos
hammer
of
years
ago
unfortunently
that
brew
just
kicked
it
and
is
really
missed
someday
i
do
hope
that
one
can
be
recreated
again
nice
brew
by
victory
and
am
glad
to
see
this
one
dthis
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
for
all
of
the
alcohol
it
is
not
present
at
all
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
it
takes
a
pretty
standard
attempt
at
the
style
but
manages
to
do
standard
quite
well
d
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
not
a
huge
porter
drinker
however
i
like
this
a
lot
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
but
also
helps
bring
out
some
interesting
notes
with
the
yeast
that
are
usually
not
present
in
a
lower
alcohol
porter
more
complex
eh
ive
had
better
by
no
means
horrible
but
also
by
no
means
the
definition
of
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
no
alcohol
presence
combined
with
pretty
good
flavor
makes
it
go
down
easy
i
really
enjoy
this
well
crafted
big
beer
quite
complex
and
dangerously
drinkable
wish
i
had
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
d
very
drinkable
wouldnt
think
there
was
that
much
alcohol
in
this
until
you
finish
the
bomber
and
stand
up
plus
i
got
this
22
for
3

excellent
definitely
worth
checking
out
and
im
glad
to
see
you
can
get
good
beer
without
paying
10
for
a
bomber
definitely
work
getting
d
not
up
to
snuff
for

but
not
terrible
it

and
a

a
decent
baltic

however
it
didnt
quite
come
together
for
me
well
worth
a
try
though
the
smell
was
toffee
just
as
advertised
with
a
sweetness
dark
fruit
in
the
background
it
smelled
delicious
and
into
the
taste
you
got
the
molasses
and
prune
fruits
come
into
play
it
finished
semi
dry
and
had
a
tad
of
burn
hit
the
back
of
the
throat
on
the
way
down
overall
very
impressed
not
much
for
a
porter
fan
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
porters
to
date
i
like
okocim
porter
best
but
this
is
pretty
good
the
style
is
still
pretty
rare
so
if
i
had
a
craving
for
one
id
give
this
another
go
one
problem
is
that
its
a
little
cloying
and
a
bomber
feels
like
a
lot
of
this
it
really
lays
everything
out
there
i
had
my
review
90
done
after
four
ounces
feel
and
drinkability
finish
is
dry
and
roasty
acidity
seems
to
heat
the
nostrils
up
a
bit
carbonation
carries
it
up
the
back
of
the
throat
when
first
starting
to
swallow
then
it
seems
to
linger
just
back
there
where
the
nasal
passage
meets
the
throat
thats
a
new
sensation
first
time
ive
ever
had
that
from
a
beer
body
is
mediumlight
i
honestly
expected
something
a
bit
heavier
carbonation
is
light
as
far
as
this
beer
is
concerned
which
is
good
since
the
body
already
seems
light
enough
much
more
carbonation
and
this
would
be
obnoxiously
prickly
and
would
feel
even
lighter
this
one
is
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
think
that
id
rather
go
with
others
over
this
one
i
think
that
theres
better
out
there
and
will
continue
to
search
for
a
better
example
of
the
style
d
solid
brew
from

i
enjoyed
this
more
than
storm

as
it
has
more
of
a
roast
character
and
less
of

the

ive
had
my

on
the
heavyweight
version
since
ive
joined
this
site
and
was

a

out

i
have

was

standards

the

of

id
love
to
get
my

on
more
of
it
typical

crafted

beer
this
is
a

of
the

when
held
to

up

was

coffee
whiskey
freshly
sawn
oak
and
a

smell
very

most
of
these
were
reflected
in
the
taste
too
with
the
addition
of
a
smokey
flavour
that
isnt
really
detectable
in
the
smell
mouthfeel
was
better
than
average
but
in

and
an

would
have
liked
to
have
seen

are
some
hops
in
there
that
balance
out

nicely
this
is
a
really
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
solid
baltic
porter
victory
does
nothing
but
impress
me
time
after
time
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
comments
a
terrific
baltic
porter
i
wanted
another
im
not
really
crazy
about
this
beer
its
decent
and
definitely
drinkable
just
feels
very
much
out
of
balance
a
creamy
roastyness
up
frount
with
a
layered
dark
fruitness
followed
by
baker
chocolate
has
a
nice
sharp
clean
dry
bitternesstangy
with
a
chocolaty
fade
a
lighter
body
than
expected
nice
creamyness
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
still
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
a
nice
baltic
would
prefer
duck
rabbit
if
i
had
to
pick
from
the
two
i
bought
a
case
when
it
first
came
out
it
had
mellowed
a
bit
yet
still
close
to
when
it
was
fresh
not
a
beer
thats
worthy
of
aging
to
me

clear

not

smells
like

chocolate

flavor
is
much
better
than
suggested
by
the
aroma
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
blend
into
a
very
fruity
center
plums
and
raisins
abound
with
hot
alcohol
becoming
prominent
over
time
finishes
with
dry
burnt
toast
notes
excellent
creamy
body
with
balanced
weight
and
carbonation
underwhelming
at
first
sip
but
becomes
significantly
better
over
time
drink
ability
a
good
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
i
suppose
i
would
buy
again
drinkability
gets
better

it
goes

ended
up
really
savoring

i
was

more
considing
how
genius

was
quite
a
let
down
by
victory
i
was
going
to
do
a
side

side
with
perkuno
but
baltic
thunder
is
not
worthy
of
that
an
ok
beer
that
is
burdened
by
its
history
and
suffered
a
difficult
birth
expecting
far
more
from
the
next
batch
excellent
beer
ive
had
a
couple
baltic
porters
as
this
seems
like
it
could
have
used
just
a
touch
more

not

somewhat

and
lacking

in

area
i
was
disappointed
expecting
it
to
be
similar
to
perkunos
i
cracked
open
my
last
hammer
for
comparison
and
the
3
year
old
hammer
is
still
much
better
and
much
more
flavorful
i
am
really
going

having

the

to
sit
for
about
20

it

with
a

rush

slowly
settled
into
a
dark
ruby
body
capped
with
a
heavy
foam

there
is
a

heavy
on

the
palate
receives
an
intense
miasma
of
black
cherry

and

supplemented
by
a
boozy
finish
that
suggests
a
tanic
red
wine
the
balance
could
be
better
and
the
mouthfeel
more

maybe
need

as
i
was
10
beers
into
a
tasting
mouthfeel

nice

and
a
dry

this
is
a
decent
beer
but
really
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
i
thought
the
wine
barrel
aging
was
good
but
not
as
forward
as
it
could
be
i
think
my
real
issue
is
that
the
base
baltic
porter
just
is
not
that
great

a

of

it

seems

everything
gets
better
when
victory
puts
their
beers
into
barrels
pick
this
one
up
its
good
overall
why
havent
i
bought
this
brew
before
now
this
brew
is
very
intriguing
and
simply
put
delcious
this
was
2013s
vintage
im
going
to
have
to
see
how
this
years
holds
up
the
vinegar
tartness
is
a
refreshing
factor
to
this
brew
imo
it
adds
a
depth
that
makes
this
malt
beer
not
too
cloying
nor
syrupy
on
the
tastebuds
back
to
basics
this
brew
is
recommended
overall
another
solid
effort
by

the

i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
this
approach
is
different
i
prefer
baltic
porters
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
such
as
the
framinghammer
from
jacks
abby
however
this
beer
is
worth
checking
out
especially
for
a
different
approach
to
the
style
interesting
beer
to
some
it
might
be
a
case
of
even
if
you
can
barrelage
something
it
doesnt
mean
that
you
should
has
the
baltic
porter
twang
to
it
and
with
the
combo
of
the
barrel
aging
an
even
higher
level
of
it
than
is
typical
woody
fruit
thing
going
on
smooth
feel
easy
to
drink
there
are
aspects
of
this
beer
that
i
think
are
interesting
but
im
not
sure
if
baltic
thunder
is
the
best
beer
to
be
aging
very
unique
beer
poured
into
pint
glass
dark
black
color
with
medium
thick
head
smells
like
a
porter
and
taste
like
porter
mixed
with
a
sweet
red
wine
not
a
bad
combination
easy
drinkability
overall
an
above
average
beer
worth
trying
for
both
porter
and
sweet
red
wine
fans
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
deep
amber
highlights
the
heads
a
solid
dark
tan
that
fades
quickly
ripe
fruit
very
subtle
and
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
smoke
on
the
nose
the
initial
taste
is
more
intense
ripe
fruit
cherries
plums
especially
some
vanilla
and
chocolate
and
then
it
tastes
like
sweet
vermouth
and
the
heeltap
of
a
manhattan
if
you
like
that
well
this
ones
a
winner
i
do
like
it
but
in
small
quantities
so
a
whole
bottle
may
be
best
divided
amongst
like
minded
friends
the
feel
is
perfect
they
really
have
the
carbonation
just
right
its
not
sticky
not
too
watery
either
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
some
bitterness
from
the
charred
malt
are
all
balanced
nicely
o
barrel
treatment
worked
extremely
well
much
better
than
the
original

pours
a
very
dark
garnet
red
almost
brown
in

nice
foamy
head
after
a
generous
pour
smells
of
dark
malts
with
very
noticeable
tannin
character
from
the

red
wine
is
there
very
subtle
but
appears
more
as
it
warms
seems
like
a
complex

tastes
of
dark

with

and
a
very
light
red

slight
burn
in
the

the
throat
from

feels
medium
full
with
nice
carbonation
and
an
even

overall
a
nicely
subtle
foray
into
a
used
red

barrel
program
red
wine
isnnt
in
your
face
and
thats
fine
this
one
seems
to
be
about
more
quieter
complexities
rather
than
a
tongue
punch
full
of
flavors
will
be
curious
what
another
few
years
do
to
the
other
bottle
will
likely
save
for
another
23
years
overall
fantastic
i
quite
liked
baltic
thunder
by
victory
and
after
the
aging
in
the
wine
barrels
it
only
gets
better
the
combination
of
the
big
robust
porter
flavors
with
that
of
a
subtle
but
pleasant
red
wine
flavor
really
creates
a
wonderfully
tasty
and
enjoyable
drink
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
opaque
dark
mahogany
brown
color
there
was
just
a
wisp
of
head
on
it
it
has
a
nice
nose
i
definitely
can
smell
a
bit
of
oak
and
red
wine
i
get
some
cocoa
too
as
well
as
some
faint
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
good
just
a
bit
bitter
taste
is
some
cocoa
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
red
wine
a
touch
of
the
oakiness
comes
thru
too
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
o
a
really
nice
offering
and
a
nice
change
in
the
barrel
aged
department
dark
brown
porter
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
smells
oaky
and
gives
off
hints
of
the
wine
whose
barrels
its
been
aged
in
oak
is
the
strongest
flavor
i
could
detect
the
fruits
of
the
wine
were
more
subtle
for
me
this
is
a
very
smooth
very
tasty
beer
the
taste
had
a
little
more
smokiness
but
otherwise
followed
the
nose
there
was
a
little
bite
of
alcohol
in
there
as
well
the
taste
also
included
a
molasses
sweetness
and
a
hint
if
the
wine
the
ending
was
a
little
dry
completing
the
barrelaged
feel
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
victory
a
blatant
attempt
to
cash
in
on
the
popularity
of
barrel
ageing
a
shame
this
is
not
half
as
good
as
unbarreled
baltic
thunder
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
then
so
were
the
first
two
drain
pour
time
this
is
unique
and
interesting
though
nothing
really
jumps
out
as
being
exceptional
the
tart
fruitwine
character
with
the
roasted
malt
are
balanced
just
not
something
i
particularly
think
is
a
good
combo
worth
a
try
but
probably
a
one
time
purchase
for
me
this
almost
seems
like
a
wine
without
the
alcohol
acetic
bite
to
it
a
gentle
beer
that
seems
to
spit
in
the
face
of
the
overthetop
crowd
this
grew
on
me
as
my
expectations
took
a
break
enjoyable
a
good
beer
smooth
and
perfectly
composed
this
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
and
rich
and
very
debonair
wonderful
balance
overall
an
interesting
beer
ends
up
being
quite
tasty
and
complex
o
victory
is
still
keeping
my
interest
and
this
beer
is
wonderful
from
the
deep
oak
aromas
to
the
full
body
taste
they
have
put
out
a
damn
good
drink
with
this
one
i
plan
on
going
and
getting
a
few
more
for
my
shelf
and
would
suggest
you
do
the
same
lol
overall
an
okay
brew
i
was
certainly
hoping
for
something
more
complex
here
really
surprised
at
how
much
the
wine
characteristics
take
over
not
bad
for
the
price
though
a
solid
brew
from
victory
this
is
not
a
robust
porter
but
the
sweetness
balances
well
with
the
medium
amount
of
wine
barrel
character
pours
really
dark
red
light
malt
bread
nose
sweet
caramel
taste
sweet
trumps
the
bitter
which
backs
the
flavor
but
not
enough
could
use
more
bite
light
carbonation
mouthfeel
good
but
not
outstanding

a
big
bodied
sipper
that
goes
down
fairly
smooth
and
viscous
the
perfect
start
to
a
snow
day
the
feel
is
a
bit
astringent
and
though
i
didnt
detect
any
hop
flavors
or
aromas
i
did
get
some
of
the
tinny
metallic
hop
sensation
there
was
also
a
light
warmth
and
a
tinge
of
fizzy
soda
overall
a
tasty
barrel
aged
porter
o
a
creamy
beer
with
moderate
cocoa
flavor
and
an
unmistakable
red
wine
oak
character
supporting
the
porter
with
notes
of
currants
cherry
oak
and
cinnamon
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
on
tap
it
hold
up
well
in
the
bottle
but
well
worth
finding
on
tap
mouthfeel
45
fullbodied
medium
carbonation
and
creamy
a
beer
that
despite
its
richness
and
complexity
is
easy
drinking
i
could
probably
drink
a
full
750
ml
bottle
of
this
mediocre
head
of
about
half
a
finger
lots
of
larger
bubbles
which
diminish
its
staying
power
and
its
all
quickly
gone
lacing
likewise
on
the
weak
side
clean
black
liquid
of
full
opacity
no
real
orange
or
yellow
tints
just
some
brown
around
the
edges
no
real
way
to
visually
gauge
the
carbonation
malty
nose
with
cocoa
mocha
coconut
butterscotch
and
vanilla
bean
maybe
a
hint
of
sour
red
wine
but
no
real
vinous
presence
at
the
same
time
no
real
hoppy
bite
either
dries
out
the
longer
it
lingers
in
the
nostrils
seems
like
a
straight
up
porter
mediumbodied
slightly
creamy

the

then
gets
quite
dry
and
close
to
dusty
in

chocolate
vanilla
caramel
a
light
dose
of
black
licorice
and
coconut
as
well
as
scone
bread
the
carbonation
is
weak
and
it
moves
at
a
sluggish
pace
glimmer
of
cherry
to
plum
fruit
not
a
lot
of
lactose
or
milky
qualities
while
its
posture
is
nice
still
wish
it
moved
more
gracefully
still
not
sure
what
the
wine
barrels
contribute
except
some
sour
notes
through
the
finish
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
just
unsure
of
what
makes
it
unusual
versus
a
basic
rendition
of
a
traditional
style
o
i
like
how
the
barrel
flavors
and
base
beer
worked
together
on
this
one
may
buy
another
to
cellar
to
see
where
this
one
goes
over
time
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
variation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
overall
im
not
sure
whos
idea
was
it
to
take
a
porter
yet
alone
a
baltic
porter
and
age
it
in
wine
barrels
but
i
think
victory
has
themselves
a
hit
its
not
for
everyone
but
most
porter
fans
would
like
salud
d
drinkability
bolstered
by
the
very
pleasant
flavor
profile
that
almost
makes
me
forget
about
the
thin
and
disappointing
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
the
wine
barrel
flavor
is
excellent
and
not
too
overpowering
nice
complexity
and
hints
of
fruit
and
wine
but
not
enough
to
take
away
from
the
flavor
a
baltic
porter
should
have
well
balanced
all
around
im
usually
not
a
big
victory
fan
but
they
made
a
great
beer
in
this
case
ive
never
head
a
wine
barrelaged
porter
before
but
this
was
a
solid
beer
i
doubt
many
other
examples
of
this
aged
baltic
porter
exist
but
id
be
happy
to
try
others
to
compare
cheers
to
the
folks
at
victory
for
experimenting
high
b
otremendous
another
home
run
for
victory
if
it
wasnt
8
5
id
drink
this
all
daynight
long
overall
was
more
impressed
with
this
than
i
thought
i
would
be
the
original
is
great
in
its
own
right
and
the
winewood
blends
nicley
into
it
initially
reading
the
description
i
was
worried
it
would
be
a
mess
but
its
def
worth
trying
pours

taste
is

and
oak
medium
body
with
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
little
dry
overall
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
porter
worth
a
try
a
least
once
i
thought
this
was
an
interesting
combination
of
a
porter
and
wine
it
worked
well
for
me
and
i
will
buy
this
again
o
a
disappointing
beer
ive
had
worse
but
i
expected
more
from
this
one
o
i
was
expecting
either
the
wine
to
wash
out
the
porter
or
the
porter
to
wash
out
the
wine
but
this
is
wellexecuted
and
relatively
balanced
quite
enjoyable
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark

with
a
thin
filmy
light

backbone
with
heavy
merlot
and
cab
wine
characteristics
all
over
the
place
very
rich
and
layered
with
a
decent
balance
flavors
are
winelike
as
well
with
a
dry
red
wine
forward
flavor
on
a
bitter
roasted

backbone
subtle
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
character

towards

in
the
aftertaste
once
again
with

into
a
slick
dry

tasty
beer
with
robust
flavors
and
a
slightly
increased
abv
that
make
it
a
sipper
d
having
never
had
regular
old
baltic
thunder
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
the
red
wine
components
dominate
in
all
facets
but
they
never
overpower
interesting
enough
and
pleasant
enough
but
not
stellar
a
very
good
beer
that
wine
lovers
would
likely
enjoy
poured
into
a
12
oz
glass
pours
black
with
a
reddish
tint
with
a
small

of

nice
merlot
after
tone
beer
is
full

and
is
a
sipper
but
to
be
expected
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
id
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
beer
great
complexity
and
complimentary
flavors
going
on
here
starts
off
as
one
beer
and
finishes
as
quite
another
pick
one
up
o
an
already
great
beer
made
even
better
by
wine
barrels
the
wine
characteristics
very
nicely
and
provide
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
towards
the
back
end
good
price
point
at
under
9
for
a
750
ml
cc
bottle
definitely
recommended
along
with
the
original
overall
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
frankly
though
i
never
thought
the
base
beer
was
a
top
flight
baltic
porter
either
the
wine
barrel
tends
to
clash
rather
than
complement
wine
barrel
aging
is
a
tricky
thing
and
i
have
tasted
some
hits
and
some
misses
this
one
is
ok
but
a
bit
of
a
miss
overall
nice
brew
to
try
o
this
was
a
bit
strange
and
also
a
bit
of
a
let
down
initially
it
smells
and
tastes
likes
a
sour
or
heading
that
direction
but
in
an
instant
i
felt
fooled
what
you
may
think
is
about
to
be
sour
cherry
is
actually
dry
red
wine
which
turns
to
mild
sweetness
as
the
chocolate
and
carmel
flavors
come
through
mouth
is
avg
at
best
being
too
watery
but
the
8
5
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
was
a
really
interesting
and
well
done
beer
i
was
skeptical
of
a
red
wine
barrel
porter
but
somehow
the
scents
and
flavors
ended
up
bring
complimentary
the
result
was
complex
and
bold
and
tasty
the
body
was
decent
but
not
great
it
had
a
reasonably
smooth
finish
and
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
sure
how
it
would
age
but
i
really
liked
it
fresh
o
really
enjoyable
and
wish
i
had
bought
more
o
the
red
wine
barrel
aging
completely
changed
the
dynamics
of
this
beer
so
it
no
longer
tastes
like
a
baltic
porter
but
like
more
like
an
oak
aged
ale
with
some
red
wine
flavors
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
o
one
would
have
to
have
a
microscope
to
detect
any
baltic
porter
characteristics
here
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
o
overall
good
beer
couldnt
have
multiples
not
that
drinkable
leaves
me
very
intrigued
and
wanting
to
try
more

that
is
tough
to
do
with
such
a
bold

felt
a

thinner
than
expected
moderate
carbonation
and
dry
solid

but
heavy
on
the

with

a
good
easy

that
works
smoothly

and
doesnt

o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
wasnt
blown
away
something
a
bit
different
for
sure
which
is
always
nice

have
it
again

review

comwatchvnfsxfnzktto
overall
at
times
it
does
seem
too
wine
like
but
its
fairly
balanced
and
easy
enough
to
finish
the
bomber
the
best
wine
influenced
beer
i
ever
had
full
bodied
with
a
moderate
barrel
presence
thats
nicely
integrated
into
the
base
adding
another
dimension
to
the
intense
smokiness
dry
toasted
oak
with
vinous
red
wine
notes
countered
by
smokedburnt
malt
toast
charcoal
and
dark
chocolate
sweet
up
front
from
the
barrel
presence
followed
by
smoke
and
roasted
malt
before
finishing
dry
decent
job
barrel
aging
this
beer
but
the
wine
and
barrel
notes
take
away
from
the
smokiness
that
i
like
so
much
in
the
base
beer
o
interesting
combination
of
flavors
that
work
to
a
certain
extent
i
would
like
a
little
more
from
the
barrel
but
with
a
big
roasty
porter
it
can
be
difficult
worth
a
try
8
110
o
i
really
enjoy
beer
thrown
into
wine
barrels
and
im
eager
to
try
more
dark
and
heavy
beers
from
either
red
or
white
oak
barrels
i
think
a
beer
like
consecration
has
flavors
that
blend
together
better
which
make
for
a
better
beer
even
so
victory
did
a
solid
job
on
what
they
set
out
to
do
and
for
the
price
this
is
awesome
i
recommend
this
one
m
creamy
and
highly
drinkable
for
abv
o
this
was
a
strange
beer
that
im
still
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
perhaps
with
more
time
this
will
turn
into
something
great
but
for
now
it
was
just
interesting
the
flavors
need
to
play
together
better
4
a
fine
take
on
a
red
wine
barrel
aged
porter
the
flavors
are
very
complementary
and
layered
in
complexity
a
little
too
subtle
to
warrant
a
higher
score
but
this
is
pretty
delicious
overall
i
am
glad
i
finally
found
this
beer
i
really
like
the
combination
of
the
porter
and
red
wine
i
think
it
really
brings
out
some
interesting
flavors
in
the
beer
to
me
while
this
beer
drinks
smooth
and
easy
it
lacks
in
flavor
one
can
hardly
notice
any
beer
at
all
i
would
thick
that
baltic
porter
was
aged
in
wine
barrels
to
give
the
beer
sutle
hints
of
wine
and
oak
perhaps
leaning
towards
a
port
not
the
case
here
and
since
i
cant
find
any
info
on
the
website
maybe
they
know
it
too
o
i
really
like
this
beer
i
wasnt
able
to
get
any
of
the
dark
intrigue
release
last
year
and
was
happy
to
hear
that
victory
and
produced
a
lot
more
of
this
so
it
would
be
out
in
a
larger
distribution
for
a
longer
period
of
time
i
really
like
the
red
wine
flavors
matched
with
the
porter
its
awesome
to
see
victory
trying
more
with
barrel
aging
overall
interesting
stuff
the
red
wine
characteristics
were
much
more
prominent
than
i
was
expecting
and
added
some
additional
complexity
i
really
would
liked
to
have
seen
more
of
the
base
beer
shine
through
but
this
was
still
a
solid
brew
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
and
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
revisiting
it
in
the
future
i
so
thoroughly
enjoy
the
base
that
a
winebarreled
version
piqued
my
interest
greatly
expectations
were
high
it
pours
a
deep
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
brown
sugar
lightlyvinegary
red
wine
and
light
cedar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
some
extra
red
wine
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
turned
out
to
be
pretty
tasty
though
it
falls
quite
short
of
the
base
if
you
ask
me
its
thinner
and
not
quite
as
robust
as
the
base
would
lead
you
think
itd
be
still
fairly
good
times
here
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
is
very
drinkable
due
to
the
lesser
abv
compared
to
most
american
barrel
aged
beers
these
days
the
red
wine
flavors
should
have
been
bumped
up
to
really
make
this
special
but
it
was
still
above
average
how
it
currently
is
i
was
a
little
hesitant
to
buy
a
bottle
of
this
thankfully
it
worked
out
in
my
favor
the
wine
barrels
dont
come
across
as
being
over
the
top
and
a
baltic
porter
seems
like
a
decent
style
to
wine
barrel
several
ive
tried
had
dark
fruit
notions
as
they
were
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
easy
drinking
and
crisp
in
the
feel
overall
not
bad
the
barrel
presence
really
took
hold
in
this
brew
and
it
is
nice
nothing
ground
breaking
here
but
worth
a
try
it
is
a
pleasant
offering
and
at
a
very
reasonable
price
point
d
good
to
try
not
a
favorite
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
surprising
with
the
base
baltic
porter
nonetheless
theres
a
tan
head
and
it
looks
nice
though
its
somewhat
perplexing
the
aroma
makes
you
thing
what
the
wine
barrels
have
done
heavy
on
the
vinous
notes
some
smoke
some
work
some
sweet
grape
tastes
smoky
malty
with
a
boozy
wine
note
caramel
and
peated
wood
body
is
pretty
much
full
creamy
and
a
touch
coating
its
a
good
beer
unique
and
perplexing
odi
borderline
loved
this
great
hybrid
brew
the
barrel
aging
really
really
really
morphed
this
brew
into
a
new
species
a
750ml
i
think
for
8
is
a
pretty
legit
price
too
when
was
the
last
time
you
bought
a
winebarrel
aged
brew
in
this
size
bottle
for
well
under
10
i
am
very
happy
i
went
after
this
one
a
big
time
success
in
my
book
overall
this
a
slow
sipping
beer
that
has
some
nice
oak
and
wine
characteristics
to
it
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
great
beer
to
start
the
night
with
and
with
my
christmas
eve
appetizers
i
love
this
brew
its
still
baltic
thunder
at
heart
just
aged
to
a
nearsouring
point
with
some
effective
cab
barrels
brilliant
stuff
recommended
overall
different
and
definitely
enjoyable
the
fruity
red
wine
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
are
a
perfect
pairing
the
flavors
do
feel
kinda
muted
especially
compared
to
the
original
baltic
thunder
o
not
for
everyone
but
red
thunder
is
unique
with
the
combinations
might
change
a
little
more
over
time
a
medium
bodied
interesting
brew
which
deserves
respect
for
the
idea
great
job
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
garnet
highlights
and
a
smallish
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
aromas
of
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
earth
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
nose
a
light
vinous
raspberry
and
strawberry
fruitiness
is
subtle
but
rounds
things
out
nicely
the
flavor
is
rich
with
lots
of
caramel
vanilla
and
chocolate
with
a
sweet
sugary
edge
light
berry
tartness
as
well
as
faint
earthy
hops
and
a
vinous
quality
provide
a
nice
balance
against
the
sweet
flavor
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
light
sugary
mouthfeel
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
the
red
wine
qualities
are
subtle
but
provide
a
nice
background
note
i
should
have
bought
a
couple
more
of
these
overall
a
really
great
brew
from
victory
hope
they
continue
to
try
new
more
challenging
brews
aside
from
their
standard
selections
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
where
some
careful
barrel
aging
was
used
to
really
compliment
an
already
excellent
base
beer
deffiantly
worth
trying
especially
if
your
already
a
fan
of
baltic
thunder
overall
hey
this
turned
out
good
kinda
like
a
beer
version
of
chocovine
chocolate
wine
but
not
as
strong
and
wine
forward
its
balanced
rather
well
easy
to
drink
and
quite
different
then
about
any
other
beer
you
can
have
i
still
enjoy
baltic
thunder
but
like
this
unique
offering
alot
id
for
sure
give
this
a
shot
if
you
enjoy
red
wine
baltic
thunder
or
chocovine
wine
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
almost
an
inch
tan
head
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
chocolate
nuts
and
oak
it
tastes
like
nuts
roasted
and
grainy
malt
dark
fruitred
wine
and
some
chocolate
and
oak
its
a
mostly
sweet
tasting
brew
but
theres
some
tart
fruit
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
slick
and
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
like
this
brew
but
i
think
i
like
the
regular
baltic
thunder
more
but
this
is
still
worth
trying
7
99
a
bottle
isnt
a
bad
price
for
this
at
all
red
thunder
is
a
very
good
all
around
beer
i
think
the
aging
in
the
wine
barrels
really
helped
this
brew
out
i
will
definitely
purchase
another
bottle
or
two
of
these
o
its
different
but
the
flavors
blend
and
play
well
together
sort
of
like
having
wine
and
chocolate
together
i
cellared
a
second
bottle
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
evolves
and
hopefully
the
oak
will
diminish
some
its
a
little
too
up
front
right
now
overall
ive
had
my
share
of
barrel
aged
beers
and
red
thunder
stacks
up
decently
interesting
choice
with
the
red
wine
barrels
the
aging
in
those
barrels
imparted
a
tangy
wine
like
note
making
me
wonder
if
some
brett
may
have
been
involved
providing
residual
tartness
either
way
its
pretty
good
maybe
time
will
mellow
it
out
a
bit
still
i
wouldnt
sit
on
a
bottle
of
this
too
long
o
not
nearly
as
wineheavy
as
i
expected
and
the
barrel
doesnt
overshadow
the
base
beer
at
all
like
what
happens
in
so
many
of
barrelaged
beers
nowadays
great
balance
o
this
was
a
release
i
was
excited
for
since
i
first
heard
about
it
victory
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
come
on
a
porter
aged
in
wine
barrel
this
beer
is
a
whole
dfferent
beast
than
baltic
thunder
it
has
adopted
many
flavors
of
the
barrel
adding
fruit
and
oak
to
the
already
roasty
porter
i
dont
know
that
i
will
be
rushing
to
the
store
to
stockpile
this
stuff
but
it
is
interesting
and
certainly
worth
trying
m
big
medium
leading
to
full
not
too
chewy
overall
a
tasty
beverage
although
honestly
think
the
wine
qualities
are
a
bit
overpowering
here
this
one
looks
like
a
baltic
porter
very
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
very
minimal
amount
of
off
tan
foam
up
top
barely
forming
a
cap
no
lacing
swirls
bring
back
something
yet
not
much
smell
is
in
between
winey
and
robust
i
can
pick
up
the
red
wine
easy
with
a
faint
tootsie
roll
scent
and
roast
a
faint
yeast
scewnt
pops
out
in
the
end
with
some
small
cocco
rounding
the
scent
out
not
picking
up
any
alcohol
taste
is
nice
with
a
mix
of
baltic
porter
roast
and
wine
barrel
oak
and
grapeberry
taste
baltic
thunder
is
not
the
thickest
bp
out
there
so
i
can
see
how
so
much
red
wineoak
sprang
up
it
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
base
beer
which
i
like
better
on
its
own
than
red
thunder
either
way
this
does
not
taste
off
imo
it
sets
out
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
body
is
a
nice
medium
with
low
amount
of
carb
even
off
the
tap
surprisingly
its
not
dead
though
this
is
a
nice
riff
on
the
original
baltic
porter
and
ill
be
looking
for
a
bottle
to
drink
when
it
gets
real
cold
out
this
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
highlights
of
red
in
it
the
head
was
thin
and
didnt
leave
much
evidence
behind
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
roasted
malt
aroma
which
is
decent
nothing
too
exciting
really
the
taste
of
the
beer
gave
off
some
chocolate
like
flavors
some
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
not
much
body
as
all
the
carbonation
was
fine
but
not
much
depth
at
all
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
wine
barrel
characteristics
at
all
from
this
beer
this
beer
seemed
entirely
different
from
the
original
version
of
baltic
thunder
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
was
old
or
if
it
was
just
a
flop
from
victory
but
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
of
this
at
all
very
low
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
round
off
this
beer
overall
an
interesting
tasty
drink
that
hides
the
abv
very
well
serving
type
bottle
very
dark
brown
almost
black
when
poured
low
creamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
decent
smell
though
not
strong
delicious
tasting
porter
full
of
flavor
nice
rich
taste
with
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
slightly
smoky
i
enjoyed
the
beer
a
lot
though
i
did
not
find
myself
craving
another
immediately
probably
because
i
found
this
beer
filling
medium
to
heavy
body
slightly
grainy
o
an
excellent
porter
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
really
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
and
some
visible
rising
bubbles
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
chocolate
vanilla
and
dark
roasted
malt
the
taste
follows
the
nose
theres
some
rich
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
with
vanilla
and
dark
roasted
malt
its
straightforward
and
delicious
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
overall
between
the
over
carbonation
and
the
metallic
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
least
favourite
baird
beer
overall
quite
surprised
with
this
one
ive
had
a
few
of
the
japanese
craft
brews
from
hitachino
nest
and
was
very
impressed
and
so
far
baird
seems
to
be
an
excellent
brewery
as
well
one
thing
i
enjoy
about
the
japanese
renditions
on
porterstouts
is
that
they
dont
over
do
anything
just
a
nice
complimentary
blend
of
flavors
whereas
some
american
stouts
tend
to
be
uneven
andor
too
heavily
hopped
wouldnt
say
this
was
necessarily
a
top
ten
favorite
but
definitely
wasnt
bad
i
had
a
delightful
time
being
surprised
with
the
complex
olfactoryflavor
journey
on
which
it
took
me
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
but
probably
wont
go
hunting
for
it
poured
into
a
maudite
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
half
finger
fine
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
dark
toasted
malt
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
cherry
flavor
of
toasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
sweet
fruit
slight
cherry
and
finishes
with
mild
hops
coffee
and
fruit
juice
medium
bodied
sweeter
and
with
more
fruit
flavor
than
most
porters
the
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
well
made
different
and
flavorful
porter
nice
compared
to
most
porters
this
smoother
sweeter
and
fruitier
taste
is
sometimes
attributed
to
lagerlike
conditions
in
the
cold
baltic
regions
this
keeps
the
beer
tamer
in
taste
despite
its
uptick
in
strength
appearance
is
very
dark
brown
to
almost
black
in
color
the
only
real
ding
i
have
for
this
brewery
is
the
carbonation
is
fairly
light
and
disappates
somewhat
quickly
likely
due
to
the
water
smell
is
of
coffee
and
mild
cocoa
sweet
aroma
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
lots
of
malt
balance
slight
bitterness
likely
from
the
hops
on
the
back
end
but
the
star
is
the
up
front
malting
thanks
brian
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
it
has
that
coastal
cityport
ocean
water
vibe
with
a
semifruity
character
that
makes
it
a
nice
rainy
weather
beer
doubtedly
so
but
if
i
ever
saw
it
on
a
shelf
again
i
might
pick
it
upor
give
one
of
their
other
offerings
a
try
overall
its
a
little
nonmatching
from
the
nose
but
its
kind
of
an
interesting
porter
to
be
drinking
and
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
any
other
baltic
porter
ive
had
before
i
could
have
this
again
worth
a
shot
for
sure
ive
had
some
pretty
decent
brews
from
japan
and
a
range
of
styles
many
wouldnt
guess
this
is
not
your
standard
rice
lager
o
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavors
of
roasted
malts
but
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
over
carbonated
and
lighterbodied
compared
to
other
baltic
porters
had
a
pint
of
this
on
tap
at
the
baird
beer
harajuku
taproom
a
squidink
black
porter
with
a
beautiful
cocoa
head
that
coats
the
glass
in
a
nice
lacing
a
bit
thin
on
the
aroma
but
still
wonderful
dark
notes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
almonds
nice
and
thick
mouthfeel
in
the
way
a
good
porter
should
be
overall
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
great
afterdinner
drink
or
even
with
a
nice
lambred
meat
dish
o
this
is
my
first
baird
beer
that
isnt
part
of
some
collaboration
and
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
especially
at
5
for
a
12oz
bottle
it
looks
great
but
theres
just
not
much
in
aroma
taste
or
mouthfeel
a
6
abv
is
low
for
the
style
but
that
being
the
case
it
makes
it
easy
to
down
2
or
3
at
a
session
oh
wait
4
99
for
one
bottle
i
think
ill
stop
at
one
its
good
but
not
that
good
o
this
was
an
alright
baltic
porter
the
metallic
taste
did
bother
me
overall
i
liked
the
flying
dog
gonzo
better
t
i
really
liked
this
one
roasted
malt
toffee
espresso
and
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
a
really
nice
baltic
porter
the
rich
syrupy
nose
is
bigger
than
the
taste
which
has
a
lot
of
the
molasses
in
there
but
isnt
too
sweet
overall
medium
bitterness
just
really
trace
amounts
of
roast
coffee
alcohol
ultimately
a
bit
shallow
like
the
mouthfeel
which
is
thin
but
a
touch
sticky
fades
a
bit
quickly
from
the
palette
and
from
the
memory
unfortunately
not
very
long
but
pleasant
with
ligh
burnt
and
toasted
notes
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
chill
haze
khaki
colored
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
primarily
in
the
taste
a
nice
mellow
roast
faint
chocolate
and
a
complimentary
presence
of
tea
like
hops
tasting
pretty
fresh
for
a
bottle
coming
from
the
foot
of
mt
fuji
roasted
malt
sweet
grain
and
a
mild
hop
flavor
without
much
alcohol
showing
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
somewhat
smooth
but
surprisingly
light
overall
a
pretty
well
done
porter
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
japan
overall
honestly
just
an
average
porter
i
have
no
reason
to
drink
this
one
again
o
this
is
a
good
offering
from
baird
not
their
best
but
a
solid
porter
doesnt
quite
have
me
sold
as
a
baltic
porter
but
this
is
a
decent
porter
through
and
through
hits
all
the
right
spots
and
delivers
the
goods
with
a
refined
balance
once
again
the
japanese
prove
their
finesse
when
it
comes
to
tackling
dark
beer
varieties
overall
although
i
dont
have
a
great
deal
of
accolades
for
this
beer
i
rather
enjoyed
it
i
dont
think
it
comes
close
to
being
a
baltic
porter
so
i
havent
rated
it
to
that
style
for
being
on
the
opposite
side
of
russia
from
the
baltic
sea
and
culture
baird
does
a
more
than
adequate
job
recreating
the
real
deal
a
pleasant
surprise
and
agreeable
enough
for
a
day
where
spring
seems
to
have
taken
yet
another
detour
on
its
already
delayed
arrival
the
gf
like
this
but
im
not
a
fan
this
beer
is
good
enough
that
its
enlightening
me
to
the
fact
that
all
beer
that
comes
from
japan
doesnt
have
to
taste
like
sapporo
love
it
very
drinkable
and
a
very
pleasant
solidly
crafted
porter
pours
a
brownish
red
color
pretty
uncharacteristic
for
a
baltic
porter
smells
like
soy
and
chocolate
milk
with
a
solid
roasted
maltiness
tastes
more
like
porterflavored
mineral
water
or
maybe
porter
tea
than
it
does
baltic
porter
rather
watery
with
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
notes
barely
tips
the
scales
as
a
porter
much
less
a
baltic
one
drinkability
isnt
bad
average
balticstyle
porter
a
little
on
the
light
sight
more
dark
brown
than
ruby
black
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
light
mild
chocolatey
scent
and
barley
dry
bakers
chocolate
taste
with
some
hop
bitterness
floating
around
coats
the
tongue
a
bit
nice
and
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
be
beefed
up
a
bit
d
the
flavor
is
just
not
good
enough
taste
is
perfectly
sweetened
dark
chocolate
with
a
nice
touch
of
smoke
and
rye
bread
has
an
unfiltered
sake
taste
that
may
or
may
not
be
my
imagination
with
japan
on
the
mind
has
a
nice
smooth
bread
dough
aspect
with
a
decently
bitter
roast
and
hop
finish
nice
nice
beer
that
was
an
impulse
purchase
in
central
louisiana
glad
i
did
as
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
much
better
than
i
expected
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
from
japan
i
wouldnt
mind
another
some
time
soon
not
bad
not
bad
not
too
much
into
the
sweeter
beers
such
as
this
still
not
a
bad
brew
poured
with
a
gigantic
foamy
frothy
light
tan
head
and
lotsa
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
walnut
highlights
aroma
is
big
malt
and
some
roastiness
plus
a
little
caramel
flavors
about
the
same
but
its
more
sweet
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
bodys
not
bad
a
little
chewy
good
carbonation
finish
is
decent
and
medium
in
length
its
pleasant
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
being
stateside
but
its
worth
a
taste
if
youre
into
seeing
what
these
new
school
breweries
are
producing
all
in
all
this
was
a
great
experience
kurofune
porter
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
from
a
place
you
would
least
expect
numazu
japan
overall
pleasant
porter
nice
taste
though
not
to
strong
just
like
a
porter
should
be
a
nice
surprise
from
a
country
that
tends
to
focus
on
hops
or
crisp
lagers
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
brew
nice
and
balanced
with
some
good
flavors
to
back
up
the
pleasant
nose
and
the
great
pour
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
thanks
again
bj
d
a
nice
drinkable
porter
that
has
some
dark
malt
character
that
borders
on
becoming
a
stout
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
is
made
up
for
by
the
dark
chocolate
in
the
flavor
well
made
and
highly
drinkable
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
it
was
more
widely
available
drinkability
whew
at
6
abv
and
with
this
much
sweetness
and
weight
im
not
going
to
be
pounding
a
bunch
but
one
pint
is
totally
drinkable
and
i
wanna
finish
it
body
is
full
and
creamy
with
just
a
touch
of
oiliness
an
interesting
interpretation
of
a
porter
and
although
i
wouldnt
say
it
fits
the
traditional
definition
of
a
baltic
porter
its
good
nonetheless
coffee
subsides
in
the
taste
and
an
english
nutty
porter
comes
through
hops
give
it
some
zip
slight
sourness
on
the
end
leaves
a
malty
residue
easy
drinking
very
solid
english
regular
porter
no
baltic
though
for
5
99
for
a
12oz
bottle
i
am
expecting
a
beer
to
be
in
the
8
5
range
or
higher
if
this
isnt
the
case
it
better
be
a
damn
fine
brew
for
me
to
justify
purchasing
again
i
do
not
believe
this
falls
into
that
category
a
fine
beer
for
3
not
6
an
interesting
beer
but
not
what
i
think
of
for
a
porter
worth
a
try
because
it
is
unique
though
i
prefer
much
more
roasted
malts
brewers
description
this
classic
dark
english
ale
is
flinty
oily
and
wonderfully
smooth
it
is
teasingly
acrid
with
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
the
inclination
is
to
resist
the
result
is
acquiescence
and
embrace
drinkability
i
respectfully
disagree
with
this
being
entered
in
as
a
baltic
porter
but
thats
neither
here
or
there
recommended
overall
an
enjoyable
flavorful
wellbalanced
beer
and
another
solid
effort
from
baird
i
like
their
ales
better
and
will
go
back
to
them
before
this
decent
but
not
inspiring
brew
according
to
the
bottle
baird
beer
is
a
japanese
craft
brewer
and
if
this
beer
is
an
indication
of
their
either
offerings
ill
have
to
give
more
of
their
work
a
try
i
had
the
baird
red
rose
amber
and
was
very
impressed
so
i
grabbed
this
today
poured
a
deep
cola
color
with
a
thick
creamy
one
finger
off
white
head
that
never
settles
it
stays
thru
the
duration
of
the
pint
very
fruity
nose
with
a
bit
of
charthe
fruit
is
not
that
of
dark
fruitalmost
tropical
in
nature
wich
was
very
different
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
it
just
glides
down
with
ease
and
is
not
overly
full
flavors
are
of
caramelbutter
up
front
with
some
hefty
fruitthe
finish
is
lightly
charred
with
a
little
bit
of
wood
this
porter
has
some
complexitydoesnt
have
alot
of
traits
of
a
baltic
porter
so
iam
not
sure
thats
what
i
would
put
it
ineither
way
very
nice
beer
poured
into
a
rochefort

chalice
black

as
is
the
taste
and
the
finish
is
mildly
bittersweet
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
is
very
very
easy
to
drink
d
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
the
label
kicks
ass
a
good
beer
for
when
you
dont
want
to
be
flattened
by
an
ris
nice
deep
mellow
and
delicious
quite
drinkable
overall
a

12

a

a
bit
light
bodied
with
a
clean
but
slightly
watery
finish
good
drinkability
but
much
more
standard
porter
likeness
than
baltic
still
one
worth
trying
from
this
brewer
though
m
d
medium
body
reasonable
carbonation
a
touch
of
slickness
nice
to
see
a
good
brewery
coming
out
of
japan
though
it
appears
it
is
an
american
displaced
in
japan
either
way
he
makes
a
decent
beer
and
id
be
looking
forward
to
the
next
id
say
this
is
more
of
a
dry
or
possibly
export
porter
more
than
a
baltic
porter
that
said
the
pour
is
nice
with
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
some
garnet
highlights
and
a
moderate
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
swirl
smells
toasty
and
yeasty
with
some
dark
fruit
even
slightly
jammy
on
the
nose
but
not
sweet
tastes
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
roastiness
some
earthy
hops
a
bit
of
ash
and
some
restrained
dark
fruit
quite
dry
and
with
a
light
lingering
bitterness
that
is
quite
pleasant
some
slight
bitter
chocolate
notes
creep
in
as
well
quite
pleasant
and
a
good
porter
all
around
chocolate
comes
through
as
the
beer
reaches
room
temperature
probably
the
best
japanese
beer
i
have
had
makoto
should
be
proud
he
would
give
one
of
these
the
ol
kumpai
i
sat
on
this
for
almost
a
year
so
maybe
thats
why
it
turned
out
so
good
it
has
a
nice
scent
sweet
but
in
a
mild
hoppy
way
the
taste
is
rich
with
chocolate
coffee
type
tannins
coming
through
nice
creamy
full
flavored
finish
highlights
this
beers
extensive
armamentarium
of
tantalizing
tastes
not
too
drinkable
because
of
the
richness
but
i
could
eat
through
about
three
or
four
in
a
sitting
taste
a
funky
spice
with
some
wood
tannin
musk
tobacco
and
dark
fruit
very
dry
finish
feels
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
but
nice
enough
to
sip

a
beautiful
brown
cocacola

2
finger
head
that
does
not
want
to
recede
smells
of
sweet
coffee
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
complete
the
nose
first
sip
is
both
sweet
and
bitter
with
coffee
and
chocolate
mixing
in
balance
with
neither
being
too
over
powering
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
bitter
finish
even
though
it
is
bottle
conditioned
the
brew
is
slightly
under
carbonated
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
but
still
this
beer
is
somewhat
creamy
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
my
first
whiff
when
i
opened
the
bottle
was
rather
fruity
more
like
a
cider
than
a
porter
the
next
whiff
though
was
smoky
and
had
a
coffee
tang
it
pours
a
dark
chocolaty
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
that
does
not
stick
around
for
too
long
flavor
has
a
strong
burnt
coffee
component
and
a
fruity
slightly
sweet
undertone
texture
is
smooth
and
quite
tingly
but
not
nice
and
thick
like
the
best
porters
i
have
sampled
all
in
all
not
a
great
porter
but
definitely
enjoyable
kurofune
is
a
fun
beer
tough
to
pin
down
but
every
bit
as
good
as
the
craft
porters
coming
out
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
usa
at
nearly
5
a
bottle
its
a
luxury
but
youd
better
believe
that
if
this
came
in
cheap
6packs
id
be
all
over
it
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
japan
and
recommended
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
thick
uniform
offwhite
to
tan
head
that
leaves
rings
of
thick
lace
around
the
mug
good
roasted
malt
aroma
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
decent
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
with
chocolate
and
a
little
licorice
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
lively
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
pours
near
black
with
a
light
tan
head
the
lacing
lingers
until
the
last
sip
the
nose
has
mild
chocolate
notes
along
with
some
fruity
esters
dates
raisins
almost
belgianesque
similar
nose
to
a
dubble
the
taste
is
mild
some
roasted
maltiness
up
front
and
a
lingering
bitterness
not
much
chocolate
or
coffee
in
the
flavor
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
high
and
fine
which
is
expected
in
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
and
an
average
porter
but
i
would
recommend
many
others
over
this
one
d
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
freind
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
favorite
as
porters
are
concerned
still
not
without
its
charms
notes
from
61408
even
though
kurofune
porter
is
too
expensive
for
regular
consumption
and
isnt
widely
available
anyway
its
a
classic
english
porter
that
is
some
kind
of
enjoyable
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
else
baird
has
up
its
brewing
sleeve
kampai
this
is
a
lovely
porter
if
you
prefer
to
have
no
coffee
flavors
in
this
style
enjoyable
brew
would
gladly
have
again
12

served

retention
and

are

excellent

is

the

too
very
nice
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little

the
smoothness
makes
this
easy
to
drink
i
just
bought
this
today
and
im
glad
i
drank
it
today
too
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
brew
i
definitely
recommend
this
this
is
the
first
baird
beer
ive
tried
hopefully
their
other
ones
are
this
good
too

this

baird
brewery
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
others
i
really
like
the
unique
but
subtle
twists
and
turns
they
took
when
brewing
this
porter
it
goes
down
easily
and
is
very
enjoyable
a
very
good
porter
that
doesnt
quite
taste
like
baltic
porters
but
has
a
nice
character
of
its
own
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
chocolate
and
roasty
malt
notes
some
tobacco
and
mild
bitterness
even
carbonation
feels
very
good
fairly
light

above

overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
with
no
flaws
at
all
thanks
to
autumnaldave

recommending
it

kind
of
clear

you
really

flavor
is
very

caramel
malts
abound
crisp

a

very

not
blazing
away
with
things
its
nice
feel
has
a
lower
but
biting
carbonation
to
it
very
pleasant
to
drink
well
done
but
not
so
much
a
baltic
porter
really
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
sturdy
carbonation
it
hits
a
nice
stride
with
how
i
like
a
porter
to
be
not
too
light
and
not
too
heavy
overall
a
great
smooth
porter
from
japan
very
glad
to
see
this
brew
make
it
over
here
and
i
hope
more
japanese
beers
make
it
this
way
as
there
are
brewers
doing
great
things
there
im
not
so
sure
if
i
could
drink
this
often
but
a
well
done
porter
nonetheless
and
the
pace
at
which
i
finished
it
surprised
me
if
youre
into
porters
try
to
check
this
one
out
intense

color
with
a

dense

head
and
a

the
smell

some

the
taste
is
of
roasted

with
hints
of

chocolate

oranges
and
still
some
red
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
great
the
beers
almost
melting
in

a

with
the

its
not

are
not
many
nice
beers
in
russia
but
this
one
is
exception
on
of
the
better
porter
beers
i
tried
not
to
strong
aroma
and
great
taste
a
bit
oversweetened
as
others
say
which
definitely
downplays
drinkability
but
still
a
solid
offering
from
baltika
and
one
of
my
favourites
from
the
brewery
o
i
really
like
this
brew
its
just
a
twinge
different
than
most
of
the
stoutporters
ive
tried
mainly
in
the
first
few
sips
when
it
almost
seems
like
an
english
pale
ale
good
enough
that
ill
try
it
again
from
time
to
time
definitely
among
the
fruitier
if
not
the
fruitiest
stoutporter
ive
tried
good
brew
the
taste
is
quite
surprising
as
i
would
have
not
associated
russia
with
decent
porter
but
this
was
not
the
worst
stout
i
ever
had
i
actually
enjoyed
drinking
it
the
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
not
overwhelming
and
not
a
strong
bitter
tasting
stout
in
fact
it
had
a
little
sweet
taste
upfront
with
only
light
bitterness
afterwards
well
balanced
it
was
very
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
to
drink
will
be
looking
out
for
this
one
again
in
the
future
recommended
but
be
careful
it
is
strong
despite
how
smooth
it
goes
down
ive
had
a
few
of
these
now
and
it
is
a
good
beer
for
the
price
tasty
porter
all
around
but
lacks
much
complexity
and
any
outstanding
nature
better
than
ol
rasputin
for
sure
and
way
cheaper
packs
a
decent
punch
with
7
abv
and
sometimes
serves
as
my
morning
donut
replacement
on
saturdays
or
sundays
much
enjoyed
for
the
price
but
it
youre
looking
for
more
complexity
you
wont
find
it
here
regardless
it
is
still
tantalizing
to
the
taste
buds
and
serves
more
than
enough
alcohol
for
dessert
without
getting
too
inebriated
just
okay
nothing
fancy
kinda
sweet
expected
it
to
taste
a
bit
more
interesting
but
thats
just
because
someone
told
me
it
rocks
my
advice
drink
this
beer
cold
like
a
mich
golden
light
once
the
tastes
all
gather
around
the
fire
its
barely
fit
for
jaimie
lannisters
table
im
beginning
to
try
more
foreign
beers
and
i
can
get
this
one
very
easily
because
of
the
large
russian
community
nearby
its
not
quite
as
good
as
many
craft
breweries
porter
but
its
not
bad
at
all
and
id
get
it
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
porter

but
overall
is
a

beer
it
is
cheap
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
decent
beer
to
knock
off

list

you
were
on

beers

something
of

otherwise
theres

before
this

anything

probably
what
a
beer
geek
would
drink
if
for
some
odd
reason
he
wound
up
in
russia
i
have
often
seen
the
inexpensive
baltika
beers
at
the
store
and
viewed
them
as
a
cheap
higher
alcohol
beer
with
not
much
to
offer
a
friend
turned
me
on
to
the
baltika
6
a
told
me
that
it
is
actually
a
really
good
porter
and
one
they
covet
i
figured
for
two
bucks
it
was
worth
a
try
the
baltika
6
is
a
baltic
porter
which
are
typically
strong
and
sweet
and
the
6
is
no
exception
it
poured
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
first
taste
was
instantly
molasses
dark
and
sweet
the
sweetness
remained
as
it
warmed
but
the
molasses
relaxed
a
bit
with
a
fuller
malt
profile
an
impressive
beer
nonetheless
o
fairly
impressive
it
doesnt
taste
cheap
like
the
4
besides
the
ashtray
kind
of
taste
this
is
a
decent
porter
eh
not
much
good
to
say
about
it
looks
pretty
good
but
i
dont
like
the
flavor
or
over
carbonation
pours
a
dark
reddish
black
with
no
lacing
and
a
2
finger
head
that
flattens
immediately
the
nose
is
booze
dark
roast
acidity
molassesraisins
some
leather
the
taste
is
a
big
letdown
with
booze
and
burnt
coffee
dominating
the
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
astringent
and
bitter
like
tea
bags
dry
and
unpleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
feels
over
carbonated
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
porter
and
i
will
not
be
having
it
again
o
bottom
line
its
a
good
porter
and
at
7
it
doesnt
tastes
strong
its
malty
and
yummy
a
bit
over
the
top
in
alcohol
flavor
and
aroma
but
nice
rich
malt
character
the
esters
are
slightly
overwhelming
and
chocolate
flavor
is
lacking
not
a
bad
brew
though
may
lay
one
down
a
couple
years
to
see
what
happens
a
decent
baltic
porter
certainly
one
of
the
better
russian
beers
but
there
is
room
for
improvement
even
at
2
19
for
12l
bottle
i
first
had
all
the
baltikas
when
i
was
travelling
in
russia
and
the
numbering
system
was
great
since
we
didnt
speak
much
russian
i
distinctly
remember
liking
s
6
9
and
a
friend
found
the
6
and
brought
it
over
to
relive
the
experience
it
was
as
good
as
i
remember
and
nice
to
know
it
actually
was
a
porter
since
i
was
just
guessing
i
like
the
color
and
aroma
i
get
a
few
hits
of
cocoa
and
coffee
in
the
taste
and
i
think
the
finish
is
nice
and
smooth
and
even
a
little
thick
i
pleasantly
try
to
suck
some
of
the
flavor
off
the
sides
of
my
mouth
i
like
this
one
and
i
think
its
my
favorite
out
of
russia
i
would
recommend
it
as
opposed
to
some
others
from
the
baltika
family
careful
not
to
compare
this
to
turbinated
us
baltic
porters
or
similar
brewdogs
pours
a
fairly
opaque
black
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
persists
forever
in
fact
it
tried
to
escape
from
the
bottle
when
i
pried
the
cap
off
the
aroma
is
dark
fruity
with
caramel
and
burnt
sugars
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
sweet
grainy
honey
like
pilsener
malt
surprisingly
shines
through
the
flavor
follow
the
aroma
quite
well
sweet
grainy
pilsner
with
some
dark
and
burnt
sugars
touched
off
with
some
chocolate
and
some
sweet
sugar
coated
dark
fruits
long
lingering
sweet
finish
with
a
touch
of
ethanol
medium
body
with
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
and
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
porter
certainly
not
over
the
top
flavored
like
some
americanized
versions
but
kind
of
nice
with
its
subtleties
dark
near
black
with
little
foam
at
all
not
attractive
really
smells
of
raisin
malt
cocoa
and
some
toasted
malts
kinda
sweet
but
i
like
it
bread
rye
more
plum
than
anything
some
toasted
malts
some
tobacco
and
a
touch
of
turbinado
medium
on
thin
with
low
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
overall
not
bad
i
would
drink
again
the
beer
is
good
but
not
great
it
is
a
daily
drinking
porter
and
i
would
buy
this
again
but
only
for
the
price
its
a
good
example
of
baltic
porter
but
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
these
every
brewing
company
makes
a
porter
but
few
make
a
baltic
porter
maybe
this
is
a
european
thing
i
will
do
some
digging
before
we
get
to
our
next
baltic
porter
cheers

note

overall
just
okay
very
average
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
kind
of
a
let
down
still
blows
their
9
out
of
the
water
tho
o
a
very
average
porter
o
pretty
basic
brew
perhaps
the
7
months
past
due
had
a
negative
effect
on
the
favor
i
would
return
to
it
given
the
right
occasion
because
hell
its
2
a
bottle
o
a
very
smooth
fruity
honey
sweet
strong
porter
overall
not
a
particularly
strong
baltic
porter
and
it
could
benefit
from
more
pronounced
darker
flavors
but
its
the
smoothest
baltic
ive
had
to
date
unfortunately
that
smoothness
does
little
when
it
becomes
too
rich
to
enjoy
othis
is
good
beeri
will
drink
it
often
overall
an
ok
porter
but
it
leaves
quite
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
flavors
are
pretty
muted
and
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
gets
to
be
a
bit
cloying
after
awhile
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
although
i
doubt
i
will
pick
it
up
again
o
very
thin
in
body
for
a
baltic
porter
and
seems
to
lack
the
vinous
notes
that
i
expect
for
the
style
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
quite
pleasant
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
o
this
beer
is
quite
light
in
body
and
watery
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
this
makes
it
relatively
easy
to
drink
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
present
in

too
sweet
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
o
average
ill
drink
it
again
but
wont
actively
seek
it
id
probably
recommend
it
if
not
just
for
the
fact
that
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
o
enjoyed
very
much
o
this
isnt
bad
but
it
also
isnt
good
it
is
just
too
sweet
for
this
guy
out
of
a
bomber
allll
the
way
from
russia
this
beer
was
a
nearly
opaque
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
shortlived
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
macro
grains
toasted
malt
a
little
brown
sugar
and
carmeleized
sugars
as
well
as
some
slightly
roasted
elements
i
instantly
thought
it
an
odd
beer
upon
tasting
because
it
seemed
to
walk
that
line
between
a
macro
brew
and
a
good
homebrew
i
tasted
a
strong
amount
of
adjunct
grains
corn
and
rice
in
particular
but
behind
that
the
more
complex
elements
of
nuts
toasted
and
roasted
malt
some
extra
sugars
sucanat
molasses
and
bread
the
finish
of
roasted
malt
lingered
pleasantly
upon
my
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
soso
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
high
for
my
tastes
o
this
was
really
good
porter
very
smooth
well
balanced
and
tasty
lots
of

but
went
down
easy
o
i
bought
this
expecting
to
get
the
feel
for
what
a
true
baltic
porter
is
obviously
i
was
mistaken
still
overall
though
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
that
desirable
to
me
in
terms
of
others
of
the
style
or
just
other
beers
available
its
certainly
not
that
bad
and
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
in
a
worse
case
of
also
ran

in
your
typical
establishment
if
i
had
this
as
a
choice
i
would
have
it
d

solid

if
not
a

enjoyed
revisiting
but
i
dont
ever
have
to
have
this
again
o
didnt
find
it
quite
as
sweet
as
most
i
consider
this
one
to
be
better
than
average
for
the
style
and
definitely
worth
trying
overall
fits
the
style
guidelines
and
while
not
the
best
porter
ive
had
its
still
a
great
traditional
style
porter
cant
understand
the
relatively
low
scores
to
be
honest
since
it
has
alot
of
soul
and
quality
to
style
and
subjectively
speaking
i
think
the
fact
it
comes
from
a
pretty
mediocre
brewery
makes
for
a
strong
power
of
suggestion
effect
rjt
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
porternothing
special
but
above
average
thick
syrupy
and
slightly
dry
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
its
ridiculously
cheap
pair
with
chocolate
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
and
fairly
interesting
to
think
about
past
experience
has
left
me
with
low
expectations
for
this
brewery
so
this
rather
mediocre
porter
was
actually
better
than
expected
if
you
like
your
porters
on
the
lighter
side
taste
wise
but
with
the
alcohol
showing
through
you
may
like
this
one
appearance
has
a
very
dark
brown
rich
color
with
a
fair
head
that
dissapates
leaving
spotty
lace
smell
of
lightly
sweet
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruits
and
molassas
taste
is
faded
in
compexity
but
still
has
lightly
sweet
roasted
malts
coffee
and
a
dark
fruit
note
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
porter
but
needs
a
little
more
complexity
and
body
overall
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
going
in
i
had
never
seen
baltika
before
and
had
not
had
a
baltic
porter
prior
to
this
bottle
it
just
happened
to
be
pretty
cheap
at
the
liquor
store
around
the
corner
so
i
figured
id
check
it
out
i
would
consider
drinking
it
again
especially
as
it
is
one
of
the
cheaper
nonshitty
beers
at
that
location
that
comes
in
this
size
bottle
but
wouldnt
necessarily
make
a
trip
just
for
it
check
it
out
if
you
come
across
it
but
you
dont
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
o
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
but
not
seek
it
out
specifically
perhaps
a
bottle
within
it
best
before
range
im
looking
for
syrupy
with
minimal
carbonation
and
enough
malt
and
sweet
to
balance
that
roast
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
explore
the
style
a
bit
getting
to
the
bottom
of
it
was
a
bit
slow
going
though
probably
due
to
the
sweetness
ohad
a
brewed
on
date
of
9211
so
it
is
fresh
and
good
flavors
i
might
get
a
few
of
these
to
keep
on
hand
been
in
kyrgyzstan
for
a
few
months
now
this
is
the
main
brewery
offered
in
the
country
so
its
everywhere
pours
dark
with
hints
of
mahagony
decent
tannish
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
good
amount
of
time
not
too
much
lacing
the
coffee
smell
isnt
as
apparent
as
i
would
like
but
still
present
slightly
smoking
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
smell
strong
smokey
feature
choclate
wood
coffee
and
a
little
grainy
decent
carbonation
but
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
more
full
than
it
is
overall
its
an
average
beer
if
youre
into
baltika
this
one
would
be
my
favorite
out
of
all
of
them
smoky
aroma
has
a
strong
tone
of
molasses
as
well
as
a
woody
hint
and
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
vanishes
rather
quickly
flavor
has
tones
of
smoked
wood
coffee
and
molasses
body
is
on
the
thin
side
and
the
fizz
is
only
slight
so
it
is
more
like
soda
pop
than
beer
still
an
acceptable
porter
o
really
solid
baltic
here
has
a
nice
array
of
flavor
and
is
surprisingly
drinkable
even
at
its
abv
no
complaints
here
i
will
be
having
more
of
these
o
excellent
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
this
beer
would
smelltaste
like
from
what
i
know
about
this
style
i
love
it
and
i
want
more
now
that
i
know
i
can
get
this
locally
its
definitely
going
to
be
a
regular
in

theres
no

was

not
terrible

ends
up

okay
to

overall
a
nice

but
for
those
looking
for
a
baltic

you
might
be
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
with
this
one
as
it
is
heavily
lager
influenced
kind
of
what
i
would
call
a
black

complex
for
a
lager
this
is
easy

fits

i
love
the

however
this
version
was
adequate

drinkable
in

it
does
not
exemply
a

it

become

loved

quaffed
oh
catherine
stop

that

pour
me
another

oa
very
boring
baltic
porter
the
flavors
are
almost

with
this
styles
the
basic
ingredients
are
supposed
to
speak
for
themselves
if
not
sometimes
the
added
ingredients
help
a
lot
this
just
has
nothing
going
for
it
at
all
i
dont
recommend
it
at
all
o
a
rich
sweet
and
relatively
balanced
porter
with
plenty
of
malt
character
to
back
up
the
near
7
abv
a
little
grainy
and
slick
so
its
still
rough
around
the
edges

its
as

of
a
brew
on
a
cool

night
as
a

o

like
it
a

because
ive
put
14
hours
of
hard
work
day
in
at
mcb
quantico
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
dark
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
it
retained
as
a
collar
and
lefts
streaks
of

the
aroma
was
of
roasted

caramel
malt
and
chocolate
the
flavors
were
full

notes
with
some
light
nuts
figs
prunes
and
caramel
along
with
some

heat
that
appeared
as
it
warmed
up
the

was
smooth

full
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
light

being
full

it
wasnt

it
up
as
well
lots
of
roasted
coffee
tones
in
the
back
and
a
nice
bitter
dry
hoppy
finish
this
was
a
really
well
rounded
and
full
taste
very
nice
indeed
very
full
pretty
much
stout
like
in
feel
rich
creamy
with
very
good
carbonation
y
on
first
opening
it
i
was
excited
because
it
smelt
very
sweet
the
taste
answered
the
call
of
the
smell
it
was
very
malty
a
little
too
malty
for
a
porter
it
tastes
a
bit
too
much
like
the
oak
barrel
stout
it
has
a
small
bite
in
the
beginning
smoothing
out
at
the
end
all
in
all
i
give
it
a
c
not
bad
not
spectacular
worth
a
try
o
decent
enough
but
i
dont
love
it
o
i
could
have
a
couple
but
not
my
first
choice
by
far
as
far
as
localregional
beers
however
ill
take
flying
dog
gonzo
porter
any
day
over
this
drinkability
a
very
nice
and
somewhat
unique
baltic
porter
definitely
a
great
winter
brew
and
another
great
offering
from
dominion
pours
a
deep
dark
charcoal
brown
near
black
with
a
nice
lasting
tight
beige
head
aroma
is
lightly
hopped
a
touch
of
mint
and
pine
over
big
chocolate
malts
smooth
nutty
sweetness
toast
and
light
burnt
hint
with
a
touch
of
diacetyl
flavor
is
clean
with
good
chocolate
hints
roast
toffee
moderate
sweetness
and
a
light
leathery
earthy
finish
to
dry
it
out
some
but
something
was
lacking
from
this
porter
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
well
balanced
and
not
too
crazy
this
is
an
approachable
offering
that
would
serve
as
a
good
introduction
to
baltic
porters
drinkability
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
not
great
but
not
a
drainpour
either
i
could
probably
kick
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
but
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
another
sixer
of
these
d
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
pretty
high
it
taste
good
feels
okay
and
goes
down
quite
easily
not
a
bad
beer
a
bit
lacking
in
spots
worth
trying
if
it
is
easy
to
obtain
as
soon
as
you
taste
the
beer
those
flavors
are
confirmed
in
the
beginning
with
chocolate
and
coffee
than
turning
sweeter
into
caramel
and
brown
sugar
but
being
checked
by
the
bittersweetness
of
hops
nice
medium
body
almost
a
little
creamy
mouhfeel
maybe
just
a
little
more
carbonation
would
do
the
beer
good
a
very
drinkable
winterbrew
very
good
job
pours
a
moderately
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
of
caramel
a
bit
if
roast
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
mildly
fruity
with
some
darker
flavors
taking
the
front
good
feel
with
good
carbonation
and
a
bt
of
heat
drinks
well
bt
fairly
ordinary
as
to
drinkability
it
holds
up
remarkably
well
the
flavors
are
not
so
powerful
that
youve
discovered
all
of
its
nuances
within
the
first
half
of
the
glass
nor
is
it
so
powerful
that
youve
blanketed
your
palate
or
become
tired
of
it
its
maltiness
is
not
overdone
nor
is
it
underdone
and
its
quite
smooth
across
the
palate
its
actually
a
really
nice
beer
well
worth
trying
its
as
straightforward
as
a
baltic
porter
can
be
balanced
the
fruitiness
and
the
roastiness
well
and
is
smooth
as
velvet
whats
not
to
like
six
years
is
a
long
time
to
wait
between
samples
but
i
think
they
have
improved
the
recipe
since
then
drinkability
good
very
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
abv
extremely
well
every
flavor
i
experienced
in
this
beer
was
incredibly
sharp
the
drink
starts
mellow
enough
with
some
wood
and
chocolate
notes
like
any
good
porter
though
the
experience
comes
in
when
the
brew
settles
on
your
pallete
there
i
found
a
medium
body
and
exceptionally
strong
bitters
i
like
a
bitter
beer
a
lot
but
honestly
it
was
too
much
for
me
the
wood
becomes
an
oak
note
similar
to
a
good
tennessee
whiskey
and
just
keeps
getting
stronger
and
more
distinct
when
you
first
swallow
the
finish
is
almost
painful
in
a
way
your
mouth
gets
used
to
it
before
too
long
but
its
still
one
of
the
strongest
beers
ive
ever
tried
smells
of
some
chocolate
and
strong
fruity
notes
raisins
and
more
cant
pin
it
down
too
much
some
hoppy
aromas
present
as
well
tastes
of
more
chocolate
slightly
astringent
there
some
more
fruit
as
well
but
more
subdued
a
surprising
though
slight
alcohol
warmth
finishes
with
slight
hoppy
bitterness
d
overall
a
very
solid
brew
and
one
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
partake
a
solid
offering
from
old
dominion
i
would
recommend
it
to
my
ba
friends
nearly
black
nose
is
mainly
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
shocked
the
hell
out
of
me
i
honestly
didnt
expect
much
as
im
not
overly
hot
on
od
these
days
but
this
beer
is
money
its
got
a
bigger
body
than
most
crisp
baltic
porters
its
a
bit
more
substantial
big
enough
roasted
malt
to
know
its
a
porter
and
the
sweetness
is
subtle
enough
for
me
if
this
thing
was
hopped
up
a
hair
i
think
it
would
be
incredible
well
done
od
im
not
going
to
be
so
hesitant
from
now
on
to
try
new
things
from
you
drinkability
a
decent
porter
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
however
for
something
billed
as
a
baltic
porter
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
complexity
to
it
regardless
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
a
good
winter
seasonal
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
really
appreciate
the
way
this
porter
is
crafted
i
recommend
this
brew
to
all
porter
fans
altogether
this
was
a
solid
porter
that
was
a
bit
on
the
stronger
side
it
was
a
nice
showing
from
odb
although
i
wouldve
liked
to
have
seen
it
brewed
bottled
in
va
instead
of
de
this
is
a
nice
winter
beer
and
i
will
definitely
buy
more
d
rich
beautiful
beer
really
enjoyed
and
was
ready
for
more
i
need
to
get
a
six
pack
of
this
gem
poured
a
dark
almost
black
body
with
a
tan
head
on
top
of
a
stoutish
smell
of
roasted
malts
coffee
toffee
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
a
smooth
creamy
stick
medium
almost
full
body
that
has
a
sweet
taste
of
chocolate
and
a
tad
vanilla
as
well
as
a
mix
of
roasted
and
toffee
malts
gives
off
a
balance
as
it
is
smooth
and
passes
easily
but
finishes
crisp
and
dry
a
duller
than
top
notch
porter
but
still
a
good
beer
that
is
enjoyable
and
will
pick
you
up
in
the
winter
drinkability
surprisingly
its
not
half
bad
that
recent
beach
house
whatever
was
a
complete
dud
for
me
and
their
oktoberfest
was
soso
so
i
was
a
little
hesitant
in
regards
to
this
winter
seasonal
but
here
i
am
enjoying
this
bottle
while
watching
blade
runner
its
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
with
a
nice
dark
maltiness
like
a
poor
mans
kalamazoo
stout
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
was
a
fan
of
the
light
smokiness
worth
a
shot
this
beer
pleasantly
surprised
me
i
bought
a
sixpack
at
the
brandnew
wegmans
in
dullessterling
va
overall
very
enjoyable
flavorful
beer
that
stands
out
for
taste
and
mouthfeel
very
reasonably
priced
as
well
a
great
value
purchase
this
beer
cuts
through
sometimes
a
brew
tastes
amazing
up
front
but
falls
short
half
way
through
and
doesnt
taste
like
anything
this
beer
always
keeps
its
hoppy
bitterness
meets
touch
of
molasses
sweetness
youll
always
have
a
nice
taste
in
your
mouth
when
drinking
this
brew
its
similar
to
terrapins
india
ale
it
lingers
longer
though
pretty
decent
local
brew
cant
say
that
ive
had
a
baltic
porter
before
but
this
tastes
like
every
american
porter
ive
had
just
like
the
other
reviewers
said
the
description
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
says
its
a
bottomfermented
lager
with
german
pilsner
crystal
dark
specialty
malts
a
touch
of
rye
could
someone
explain
this
to
me
how
is
this
not
an
ale
and
does
that
mix
of
malts
make
for
a
typical
american
lager
a
nice
drinkable
beer
especially
warming
at
7
abv
finishes
very
rounded
and
nicely
balanced
its
christmas
only
with
chocolate
beer
is
sweet
and
has
a
lot
of
bitterness
from
the
roast
at
the
back
end
the
sweetness
is
interesting
adds
nice
connectivity
but
the
roast
at
the
end
definitely
wins
its
not
coffee
flavored
at
all
just
an
interesting
malt
flavor
a
little
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
a
little
thin
but
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
high
pours
an
opaque
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
rich
aroma
is
chocolaty
with
smoky
nutty
and
coffee
hints
flavor
is
like
a
fine
chilled
mocha
mainly
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
smoky
nutty
and
molasses
touches
texture
is
smooth
fizzy
and
lively
a
winner
not
bad
i
dug
the
overll
flavors
and
interaction
here
for
the
baltic
porter
style
but
i
just
wish
that
they
had
been
a
bit
more
aggressive
and
defined
id
like
to
see
them
continue
to
work
on
this
recipe
as
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
really
solid
winter
seasonal
from
them
d
i
enjoy
the
baltic
porter
but
i
must
admit
i
have
a
hard
time
drinking
a
lot
of
it
at
once
i
cant
identify
any
offflavors
that
would
explain
that
but
my
best
guess
is
that
im
expecting
a
stout
which
is
not
necessarily
a
good
reason
the
baltic
porter
is
a
great
example
of
the
differences
between
a
porter
and
a
stout
the
baltic
porter
lacks
the
coffeelike
astringency
that
i
expect
from
stouts
but
it
still
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
feels
like
a
big
beer
that
said
i
suspect
i
also
dont
session
baltic
porter
because
it
is
a
bigger
beer
and
has
the
associated
abv
served
in
an
faceted
mug
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
so
many
authentic
european
examples
available
that
this
isnt
particularly
one
to
seek
out
a
nice
worthwhile
effort
though
hv
m
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
level
very
robust
as
well
as
being
smooth
and
creamy
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
purple
highlights
two
fingers
of
foamy
beige
head
fade
quickly
leaving
a
spotty
lacing
ring
smells
of
molasses
coffee
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
nuts
tastes
of
citrus
zest
cocoa
powder
and
nuts
up
front
then
some
caramel
and
molasses
dark
fruits
like
plums
and
raisin
and
then
a
slightly
bitter
and
salty
finish
of
coffee
and
soy
sauce
medium
in
body
with
low
carbonation
a
little
watery
in
places
but
also
quite
thick
in
others
in
all
pretty
easy
to
drink
thanks
go
to
kegatron
for
the
bottle
d
divinely
good
this
beer
is
very
very
good
i
have
to
admit
from
the
outset
that
baltic
porter
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
have
some
very
specific
notions
about
what
this
style
can
and
should
behave
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
brown
head
that
does
not
retain
well
unlike
several
others
of
its
class
smells
roasty
and
like
the
back
of
the
bottle
says
a
bit
like
black
licorice
but
is
remarkably
understated
to
the
point
of
being
uninteresting
the
taste
however
will
knock
your
socks
off
fullbodied
wellrounded
extremely
complex
and
layered
flavors
that
make
you
marvel
at
every
sip
this
is
extremely
tasty
black
licorice
check
dark
chocolate
check
roastiness
smoke
expresso
check
check
check
this
beer
spans
the
entire
baltic
porter
flavor
spectrum
and
does
so
in
a
very
balanced
way
this
a
suberb
beer
once
you
get
it
to
your
palate
3
0
d
not
anything
special
at
all
but
no
huge
problems
either
so
the
age
old
debate
do
i
review
this
as
a
baltic
porter
per
the
bottle
label
or
do
i
review
this
as
an
american
porter
per
the
ba
site
or
do
i
go
with
a
bjcp
style
category
yeah
i
was
kidding
with
that
last
one
im
going
to
go
with
the
ba
category
of
american
porter
this
drank
nice
hada
good
porter
coffe
aspect
to
it
but
fell
short
in
the
cleanliness
and
maltiness
of
a
baltic
porter
as
ive
had
them
id
happily
drink
another
i
just
wouldnt
worry
about
style
classification
drinkability
is
high
for
me
this
is
a
beer
with
a
good
strong
flavor
but
not
so
powerful
that
you
cant
enjoy
several
look
out
for
the
7
abv
though
i
took
a
recent
trip
out
to
virginia
and
drank
gallons
of
dominions
oak
barrel
stout
im
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
another
of
their
offerings
and
thoroughly
enjoy
this
brew
the
label
may
be
a
little
misleading
but
whats
in
the
bottle
is
quality
thanks

a

on

side
not
bad
but
labeling
it
a

seems
a
bit
misleading
not
a
bad
american
porter
though
handdelivered
from
ashburn
to
vienna
thanks
chris
and
jeff
my
33cl
bottle
looks
just
like
the
one
in
the
picture
couldnt
find
any
freshness
info
pours
a
clear
dark
cola
brown
under
a
deep
tan
head
that
barely
rises
above
film
and
settles
quite
quickly
without
managing
to
generate
any
lace
the
nose
is
strong
of
coffee
and
nuts
with
a
hint
of
licorice
the
mouth
is
slightly
cloying
and
well
carbonated
leaving
a
bit
of
a
prickly
sensation
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
definitely
porter
with
a
good
taste
of
nuts
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
there
is
also
a
fruity
sweetness
such
as
from
dark
plums
or
red
grapes
the
hops
are
subdued
but
never
absent
generating
an
espresso
bitter
at
the
slow
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
ache
in
the
aftertaste
the
sweetness
never
goes
away
though
in
fact
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
too
long
for
my
taste
still
a
solid
brew
and
probably
the
last
sample
ill
get
of
dominion
brewed
in
virginia
sigh
drinkability
not
too
bad
for
a
porter
even
though
it
has
a
rather
heavy
body
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
another
good
one
from
old
dominion
even
though
ive
only
tried
a
few
of
their
beers
they
have
all
been
pretty
good
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
d
very
drinkable
and
right
along
the
lines
of
what
you
should
expect
from
a
winter
brew
however
i
would
almost
definately
like
more
hops
in
the
finish
that
might
remind
me
a
little
more
that
im
drinking
a
beer
its
true
that
you
would
never
know
this
was
a
7
abv
by
the
taste
poured
a
deeper
mahoaony
color
with
an
averaged
sized
tan
head
aromas
of
roast
piney
rye
chocolate
and
some
nuttiness
tastes
of
chocolate
roast
lightly
earthy
caramel
and
some
rye
alcohol
content
well
hidden
light
lacing
left
on
the
glass
both
the
aroma
and
taste
seem
to
lack
standout
characteristics
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
direct
from
the
brewery
this
beer
was
delicious
very
dark
color
with
ruby
hues
around
the
edge
when
held
up
to
the
light
smell
was
of
grain
dark
malt
licorice
and
toffee
goes
down
smooth
on
a
cold
night
very
easy
drinking
for
7
2
abv
taste
was
rich
in
grain
malt
and
spiciness
mouthfeel
was
full
rich
and
smooth
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
nice
job
as
far
as
whether
its
an
american
or
a
baltic
im
leaning
towards
baltic
on
this
one
d
could
drink
this
endlessly
very
good
so
if
i
get
this
right
od
is
hanging
it
up
too
bad
as
i
find
this
to
be
solid
beer
even
if
its
a
bit
of
a
alsoran
had
this
at
the
brewhouse
in
the
dc
convention
center
far
superior
to
the
aviator
amber
lager
which
i
switched
to
and
a
solid
brew
in
my
opinion
appearance
is
a
near
black
with
a
nice
big
fluffy
tan
head
and
solid
lacing
nose
is
mild
but
some
roasted
malt
and
swirling
fruit
flavors
nicer
but
still
doesnt
have
as
much
oomph
as
it
could
roasted
malt
some
fruit
a
hint
of
hops
but
not
particularly
there
a
little
dirtier
than
most
porters
almost
stoutish
feel
was
solid
appropriate
for
the
style
but
not
really
creamy
enough
to
be
interesting
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
id
have
again
overall
bland
worth
trying
but
otherwise
lackluster
though
they
call
this
a
baltic
porter
i
agree
with
the
ba
designation
of
american
porter
this
doesnt
seem
to
pack
the
alcoholic
punch
associated
with
most
baltics
ive
had
that
said
im
happy
with
it
its
nothing
too
extreme
but
flavorful
balanced
and
drinkable
my
first
from
old
dominion
and
i
was
generally
impressed
d
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
tonight
with
a
cold
soaking
rain
outside
a
nice
winter
offering
and
good
to
see
the
folks
at
dominion
expanding
their
rather
small
line
of
beers
for
the
holidays
at
least
its
nothing
outstanding
but
its
a
great
buy
for
6
99
a
sixer
m
d
a
little
syrupy
the
whole
experience
was
kind
of
reminiscent
of
a
soda
thats
been
sitting
a
few
hours
mild
carbonation
a
little
flat
feeling
kinda
syrupy
and
sweet
its
not
a
bad
brew
though
its
not
really
what
i
would
expect
of
the
style
i
suppose
this
is
the
latest
from
old
dominion
as
i
havent
seen
it
yet
and
i
only
live
an
hour
from
the
brewery
it
is
a
very
nice
full
porter
for
the
winter
time
with
all
the
classic
flavors
lots
of
dark
malts
roasted
flavors
and
a
nice
hint
of
rye
in
the
background
quite
high
in
alcohol
but
none
of
the
taste
they
did
a
very
good
job
of
masking
the
alcohol
flavor
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
redbrown
with
a
strong
head
and
great
winterwarmer
aroma
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
can
find
it
and
hard
to
beat
the
price
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
say
that
a
lot
but
this
bourbon
barrel
edition
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
decadent
beverages
going
at
12
abv
and
with
enough
boozy
sweetness
to
render
its
lager
yeast
past
a
distant
memory
a
half
shade
lighter
than
shiny
black
shoe
polish
the
head
surges
near
the
rim
of
the
glass
on
the
pour
and
only
relaxes
slowly
it
smells
incredible
dry
fruity
must
the
wood
is
very
very
prominent
and
the
lack
of
bitterness
in
the
malt
base
means
the
sweetness
of
the
bourbon
is
high
they
may
have
overshot
the
grain
bill
just
a
bit
as
this
beastly
bodied
brew
has
enough
sugar
to
keep
on
going
up
good
bourbon
barrels
i
suspect
as
there
are
no
weird
thin
fusel
notes
on
this
and
the
charcoal
aspect
is
there
all
the
way
ashy
almost
burnt
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
before
it
gives
way
to
traces
of
rum
licorice
and
espresso
potting
soil
earthiness
to
it
as
well
before
the
sugars
come
on
the
alcohol
is
very
strong
no
denying
that
i
wonder
what
lager
yeast
they
used
to
get
it
here
the
science
is
as
interesting
as
the
final
product
a
bold
but
elegant
brew
on
the
whole
my
first
form
arcadia
maybe
not
my
favorite
baltic
porter
as
the
thing
that
makes
that
style
awesome
is
paved
over
a
bit
here
but
the
beer
is
of
astounding
quality
id
like
to
cellar
one
awhile
thanks
to
thebrewo
for
opening
this
one
with
me
o
completely
stunned
not
often
partial
to
porters
this
one
easily
eclipsed
the
very
best
of
em
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
was
superior
coupled
with
some
favorite
flavors
and
feels
gotta
try
it
dark
brown
pour
rich
creamy
beige
head
massive
bourbon
aroma
right
away
tons
of
vanilla
as
well
taste
is
creamy
smooth
with
the
vanilla
really
shining
through
lots
of
chocolate
too
the
bottle
has
been
sitting
for
over
2
years
now
so
i
dont
get
much
booze
age
has
done
this
well
i
think
im
drinking
it
at
the
perfect
time
body
isnt
the
fullest
but
its
not
meant
to
be
for
the
style
very
very
easy
to
drink
awesome
poured
from
a
bottle
let
it
warmup
a
bit
from
fridge
temperature
the
beer
is
a
nearly
opaque
blackbrown
with
red
highlights
there
was
a
scant
dark
brown
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
typical
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
oak
and
bourbon
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
virtually
no
hops
the
taste
follows
but
the
oak
and
bourbon
are
slightly
downplayed
compared
to
other
similar
barrel
aged
beers
letting
more
of
the
porters
character
to
shine
through
as
a
result
some
roasty
malt
is
evident
the
body
is
medium
with
mediumlight
carbonation
overall
this
is
more
what
im
looking
for
in
a
barrel
aged
beer
less
of
the
cloying
oak
and
bourbon
sweetness
that
is
characteristic
of
many
others
too
bad
its
so
pricey
so
this
one
will
remain
a
special
treat
o
not
my
thing
decent
but
hasnt
melded
together
as
well
as
it
could
have
o
has
an
aroma
profile
to
match
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
harsh
and
the
bitterness
is
not
very
pleasant
in
the
finish
a
tasty
but
unbalanced
beer
to
a
fault
in
this
case
this
is
a
very
bourbon
forward
barrel
aged
porter
the
booziness
is
apparent
from
the
nose
right
from
the
get
go
definitely
get
a
lot
of
toffee
caramel
and
chocolate
here
at
12
this
packs
a
punch
but
it
goes
down
easier
than
the
abv
would
have
you
imagine
a
sipper
with
complexity
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
perhaps
a
bit
extreme
in
some
respects
but
overall
a
pretty
awesome
brew
serving
type
bottle
really
nice
beer
that
slowly
gets
better
as
it
warms
it
stays
true
to
being
a
porter
with
its
mouthfeel
but
i
still
cant
help
but
feel
it
could
use
a
little
bit
more
body
as
it
stands
its
way
too
damn
drinkable
for
an
1112
beer
this
beer
is
an
absolute
treat
but
at
8
a
single
it
makes
me
hesitate
but
it
also
makes
me
wonder
why
do
i
think
twice
about
getting
a
12oz
bottle
for
8
but
i
dont
double
take
at
the
price
of
1820
for
a
22oz
bomber
pours
oily
black
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
but
a
creamy
and
lasting
lacing
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
smells
of
rich
caramel
and
oak
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
booze
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
strong
bourbon
presence
and
lots
of
toast
and
toffee
mouth
feel
is
slightly
more
smooth
lighter
than
what
youd
expect
from
the
malt
profile
and
barrel
presence
finishes
sweet
and
clean

for

overall

really
good
ba
porter
very
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
at
12
was
also
extremely
pricey
which
will
keep
me
from
giving
it
a
ringing
endorsement
however
price
aside
it
was
a
very
good
ba
ale
worth
a
try
no
huge
bourbon
tones
just
lots
of
rich
dark
chocolate
flavors
really
not
as
complex
as
i
would
hoped
o
bourbon
barrel
aged
shipwreck
was
a
real
treat
and
honestly
a
bit
under
appreciated
in
my
view
this
thing
is
class
in
a
bottle
and
i
will
look
for
it
every
time
a
batch
is
bottled
it
keeps
true
to
barrel
aging
big
brews
while
adding
some
unique
character
from
the
michigan
brewery
this
put
arcadia
on
the
map
for
me
and
opened
up
many
other
experiences
for
me
and
their
offerings
very
delightful
stuff
o
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
great
flavor
and
some
booze
to
make
this
a
great
fall
sipper
it
didnt
seem
to
mellow
as
it
warmed
and
the
alcohol
intensified
i
still
enjoyed
every
sip
the
roasty
goodness
that
brew
could
be
is
completely
overbalanced
by
the
booziness
that
said
i
would
still
recommend
this
for
a
huge
beer
that
does
not
hide
its
hugeness
but
rather
wears
it
proudly
additional
note
i
drank
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
at
a
colder
temperature
and
it
was
more
pleasant
some
chocolate
notes
came
out
and
the
finish
was
less
bitter
overall
strong
work
from
arcadia
really
nails
the
bourbon
barrel
presence
without
letting
it
take
over
the
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
a
bb
stout
but
worth
a
try
o
with
an
abv
like
this
i
cant
help
but
compare
to
others
in
the
same
range
this
is
very
good
but
not
quite
that
good
a
solid
porter
base
but
the
bourbon
was
pretty
mild
to
me
i
guess
i
hoped
it
would
be
a
little
more
aggressive
enjoyable
but
there
are
options
with
more
personality
especially
at
this
high
abv
i
like
the
idea
of
being
cautious
but
this
12
beer
has
all
the
character
of
a
9
beer
the
bottle
was
super
difficult
to
get
open
a
really
fantastic
and
underrated
barrel
aged
brew
o
as
i
said
earlier
i
do
not
normally
like
porters
this
however
is
a
very
good
barrel
aged
example
i
love
when
beers
have
wax
on
top
so
that
adds
to
the
appearance
go
try
this
it
is
a
great
pour
and
it
is
something
that
i
rarely
try
the
beauty
of
trading
ogood
blend
and
balance
of
flavors
smooth
and
enjoyable
opened
up
a
bottle
from
2014
smells
great
looks
great
but
there
is
an
off
taste
that
i
can
not
explain
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
without
a
year
of
being
sat
in
my
basement
o
very
good
definitely
starts
bourbon
heavy
but
some
of
the
complexities
that
follow
are
quite
enjoyable
combined
with
a
silky
smooth
delivery
certainly
worth
a
try
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
to
this
cut
the
wax
with
a
sharp
knife
just
below
the
cap
and
had
no
problem
what
a
pain
to
get
the
wax
off
the
cap
otherwise
quite
good
guess
they
call
this
a
porter
at
12
tastes
more
like
a
stout
to
me
lots
of
chocolate
notes
in
the
noise
and
north
heavy
booze
taste
should
dissipate
after
some
time
pretty
darn
good
excited
for
this
to
age
a
bit
o
very
tasty
bourbon
barrel
porter
the
base
beer
seems
like
it
has
a
bit
of
a
hard
time
holding
its
own
against
the
heavy
bourbon
flavors
it
seems
the
roasted
malt
character
just
doesnt
have
the
same
strength
that
it
would
have
in
a
similar
stout
and
thus
gets
lost
a
little
its
not
bad
dont
get
me
wrong
just
heavy
on
the
bourbon
flavors
with
complimentary
porter
characteristics
and
not
the
other
way
around
like
it
usually
goes
very
oaky
in
general
too
if
thats
your
sort
of
thing
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
ba
beer
ive
been
hesitant
to
buy
it
given
the
price
tag
but
was
fortunate
to
score
this
as
an
extra
i
will
most
likely
pick
this
up
in
the
future
when
i
feel
like
splurging
definitely
a
must
try
at
least
once
o
overall
a
decent
porter
with
an
good
smell
but
an
overpowering
amount
of
bourbon
from
a
taste
perspective
dark
brown
color
with
a
decently
foamy
offwhite
head
smells
and
tastes
strongly
like
bourbon
also
has
plenty
of
malts
and
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
has
a
fullbodied
feel
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
a
nice
drink
to
warm
you
up
but
it
is
definitely
strong
o
i
picked
this
up
on
a
trip
to
michigan
on
a
recommendation
from
the
store
owner
its
the
last
bottle
but
have
to
say
this
fell
flat
for
me
if
the
aroma
was
better
and
some
of
the
off
flavors
i
was
picking
up
maybe
it
was
age
or
an
infected
bottle
were
fixed
it
probably
would
be
a
very
solid
beer
but
this
one
not
so
much
o
nice
job
arcadia
really
held
up
well
for
being
a
few
years
old
would
like
another
one
of
these
but
only
have
one
the
bourbon
is
pretty
bold
so
if
you
enjoy
that
type
of
thing
this
will
be
a
beer

you

pretty
mediocre
here
not
outright
bad
just
to
thin
taste
and
body
wise
with
to
much
fusel
alcohol
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
one
most
likely
due
to
the
almost
nonexisting
barrel
presence
thin
mouth
feel
and
an
overall
lack
of
flavor
weak
in
the
nose
but
i
found
a
little
roasted
malts
even
less
vanilla
and
some
chocolate
i
dont
know
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
like
more
of
a
bourbon
flavor
forward
and
from
what
ive
read
the
2011
vintage
was
probably
for
me
definitely
going
to
give
it
another
shot
overall
this
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
bourbon
barreled
porter
only
with
more
bourbon
than
you
might
be
ready
for
to
me
thats
a
good
thing
the
taste
is
very
bourbon
dominant
but
has
a
lot
of
character
following
it
i
really
liked
the
flavor
and
the
feel
of
this
i
will
be
getting
more
and
enjoying
more
often
excellent
very
very
nice
a
truly
delicious
and
potent
porter
meant
for
sipping
decadent
and
very
strong
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
big
slowdrinking
beers
as
it
goes
down
smooth
and
velvety
but
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
right
away
very
good
o
this
is
a
knock
your
sox
off
ass
kicking
barrell
aged
porter
i
wanted
to
savor
every
sip
and
really
make
this
one
last
but
before
i
knew
it
this
wild
ship
wrecked
bitch
was
gone
i
got
two
of
these
with
the
idea
of
aging
one
but
i
may
just
go
back
and
get
a
few
more
to
age
for
a
few
years
o
dominated
by
the
boozy
bourbon
not
hot
but
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
the
finish
dries
out
and
is
maybe
a
touch
astringent
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
super
tasty
i
am
wondering
how
age
will
affect
the
beer
poured
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
a
great
bourbon
nose
full
mouthfeel
and
lingering
aftertaste
a
one
inch
head
appears
when
poured
that
quickly
dissipates
minimal
head
retention
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
this
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
barrel
aged
porter
overall
quite
possible
the
most
balanced
strongest
porter
i
ever
drank
so
worth
the
price
of
admission
seeing
the
base
beer
retired
makes
me
sad
as
it
was
a
long
time
want
with
me
still
trying
this
i
can
see
an
enhanced
bourbon
soaked
version
of
what
i
once
loved
pick
it
up
if
you
can
what
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
i
love
when
i
find
myself
drinking
exactly
what
i
want
to
be
drinking
at
this
point
in
time
highly
recommended
arcadia
barrel
aged
shipwreck
porter
45
pours
black
with
a
tiny
tan
head
a
little
light
on
the
nose
with
notes
of
bourbon
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
taste
has
slight
tartness
to
it
with
the
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavors
from
the
nose
and
a
little
coffee
i
hoped
for
a
little
more
barrel
flavor
than
i
got
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
nonbarrel
aged
options
for
a
lot
less
money
o
this
is
an
interesting
brew
and
most
memorable
one
from
arcadia
that
ive
had
the
bourbon
character
doesnt
linger
as
much
as
i
hope
for
in
bba
beers
kinda
of
turns
into
a
regular
porterstout
after
the
initial
bourbon
leaves
your
palate
i
was
surprised
to
feel
little
burn
with
the
12
would
like
to
try
black
butte
sometime
to
compare
glad
i
picked
this
up
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
and
its
flavoring
the
aroma
takes
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
aspect
of
this
guy
all
the
way
to
the
point
of
boxing
many
of
the
other
components
out
just
so
it
can
be
seen
and
appreciated
the
flavor
while
inclusive
of
the
wonderful
warming
oaky
bourbon
glory
leaves
much
more
room
for
the
base
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
to
blend
and
show
through
the
balance
is
actually
great
but
may
be
a
touch
to
boozy
for
the
unseasoned
this
beer
marks
our
introduction
to
arcadias
barrel
program
and
only
makes
us
more
excited
about
shipwrecks
brethren
this
is
one
beer
that
certainly
lives
up
to
the
hype
in
every
category
and
we
are
ever
so
grateful
to
have
finally
gotten
to
experience
this
local
gem
o
this
was
one
incredible
beer
im
very
glad
i
let
this
sit
for
a
year
because
its
drinking
fantastic
right
now
anyone
that
still
has
bottles
should
really
consider
opening
them
right
now
i
cant
see
it
getting
much
better
than
this
eh
i
was
definitely
let
down
a
bit
by
this
one
a
little
too
sweet
way
too
bourbon
heavy
and
has
some
strange
flavors
that
didnt
mesh
well
maybe
its
the
2011
version
ive
heard
later
releases
have
toned
down
the
bourbon
quite
a
bit
but
this
one
was
a
little
too
much
huge
props
to
ron
for
an
awesome
trade
o
ok
ba
porter
whatever
barrels
they
use
for
this
beer
i
get
more
booze
than
a
specific
distill
2011
bottle
poured
010713
pours
a
midnight
black
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
even
after
aging
quite
a
bit
the
bourbon
is
the
star
attraction
in
both
aroma
and
taste
aroma
also
contains
a
wonderful
chocolatey
malt
tastes
of
a
heavy
bourbon
but
tapers
off
nicely
into
smooth
vanilla
it
is
a
bit
on
the
thinner
side
for
a
12
abv
beer
but
makes
it
very
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
o
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
arcadia
almost
a
year
old
not
including
the
year
spent
in
barrels
and
while
the
flavors
blend
extremely
well
this
beer
is
still
pretty
hot
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
for
12
though
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
oily
and
warm
palate
make
for
a
great
sipper
and
nightcap
overall
i
would
say
that
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
bit
underwhelming
i
needed
a
more
full
flavor
and
a
thicker
body
i
dont
think
i
need
any
more
in
the
future
m
rounded
tons
of
bourbon
depth
not
bad
but
its
not
not
for
me
it
doesnt
seem
to
even
try
for
balance
the
base
beer
never
quite
surfaces
there
are
much
better
and
well
rounded
barrel
aged
beers
out
there
for
far
less
money
overall
really
nice
would
definitely
have
again
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
barrel
treatment
is
overdone
as
i
can
still
get
a
good
amount
of
roast
and
malt
out
of
it
im
a
fan
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
has
the
expected
black
color
with
low
carbonation
and
very
little
head
the
aroma
was
a
grapeylike
whiskey
aroma
this
was
not
a
typical
whiskey
aroma
which
should
have
been
my
first
clue
that
something
was
wrong
the
initial
taste
was
the
smooth
yet
biting
sensation
of
alcohol
rather
than
drinking
beer
it
felt
like
i
had
a
mouth
full
of
cheap
whiskey
amidst
the
burn
were
hints
of
a
bunred
dark
malt
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
these
pleasant
notes
could
not
overcome
the
burn
of
the
alcohol
in
my
mouth
that
continued
to
burn
in
the
aftertaste
there
was
no
sense
of
balance
to
this
beer
i
am
able
to
recommend
several
good
barrel
aged
porter
but
this
would
not
be
one
of
them
verdict
delicious
porter
great
barrel
characteristics
and
nice
complexity
on
the
tongue
not
overly
boozy
for
12
but
certainly
a
big
warm
beer
arcadia
certainly
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
loves
a
porter
or
barrel
aged
beer
cost
5
99
for
a
12
oz
bottle
overall
this
is
one
delicious
brew
it
is
certainly
bourbon
forward
it
is
a
little
hot
so
be
forwarned
if
you
do
not
enjoy
bourbon
forward
barrel
aged
brews
this
is
a
most
enjoyable
brew
and
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
delivers
a
big
beer
with
rich
bourbon
aged
and
that
added
to
richness
black
thick
head
fuller
mouthfeel
solid
porter
and
drinkable
but
too
big
a
beer
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
chocolate
and
understated
roast
a
spot
of
wood
and
coffee
worth
a
try
overall
the
porter
has
difficulty
standing
up
to
the
barrel
but
it
all
tastes
good
i
dont
get
how
a
12
porter
feels
too
weak
for
the
barrel
but
it
does
o
this
was
a
very
good
bb
aged
beer
the
bourbon
wasnt
too
overpowering
there
was
a
nice
fruity
cherry
flavor
that
balanced
well
with
the
bourbon
and
light
chocolate
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
especially
at
12
due
to
its
high
abv
its
not
something
id
want
to
drink
all
the
time
or
a
full
12oz
again
but
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
have
from
time
to
time
in
small
doses
i
hope
to
enjoy
this
one
again
in
the
future
excellent

feet
away
lovely

really
would
place
the

plenty
of
roasted

in
the
flavor
along
a
hint
of
cocoa
carb
is
about
right
with
moderately
subdued
but
the
body
is
thin
for
the

really
a
nice
beer
and
im
glad
ive
tried
it
i
would
love
to
drink
more
of
it
if
it
was
around
really
a
diamond
o
good
for
a
bourbon
aged
brew
but
not
worth
the
rather
high

could
use
a
little
more

drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
brewery
ive
never
heard
of
this
is
a
decent
barrel
aged
brew
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
and
isnt
very
strong
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a

the
aroma
is
full
of
bourbon
and
chocolate
with
some
nice
maple
and
a
hint
of
oak
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
even
more
complex
than
the
aroma
and
is
very
nice
i
get
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
as
well
as
some
whiskey
maple
and
vanilla
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium

im
liking
this
it
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
big
boys
of
bourbon
barrel
stoutporters
of
the
twelve
ounce
realm
but
its
in
the
drinkable
second
tier
for
sure
favorite
arcadia
thus
far
o
a
really
nice
baltic
porter
here
almost
stout
like
the
barrel
aging
is
well
done
though
im
not
sure
the
base
beer
had
quite
enough
character
to
hold
up
to
the
wood
which
is
just
a
little
too
strong
on
the
finish
otherwise
this
is
just
a
really
nice
porter
with
a
wonderful
roasted
chocolate
malt
and
dark
fruit
presence
and
some
solid
bourbon
notes
quite
impressive
o
very
impressive
brew
for
sure
seek
this
one
out
o
a
good
big
barrelforward
porter
sure
to
slake
your
thirst
for
such
a
beer
given
the
size
and
intensity
of
the
flavors
this
is
probably
best
shared
big
and
flavorful
enough
to
stand
up
to
a
variety
of
cheeses
or
desserts
very
enjoyable
and
an
easier
to
get
bal
beer
falls
shy
of
perfect
in
a
few
areas
and
solid
overall
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
up
front
with
a
semi
dry
finish
with
plenty
of
oaky
tannins
damn
nice
beer
o
honestly
pretty
out
of
balance
the
barrelageing
is
overdone
and
the
malt
underdone
2011
edition
pours
dark
opaque
brown
velvety
looking
and
no
head
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
bourbon
tastes
of
chocolate
bourbon
roast
a
bit
of
licorice
and
more
chocolate
bourbon
great
mouthfeel
that
gets
chewier
as
it
warms
up
whiskey
is
strong
but
does
not
overpower
the
complex
porter
low
carbonation
here
a
bit
heavy
but
really
velvety
and
smooth
man
is
this
good
it
feels
so
fantastic
in
your
mouth
so
full
bodied
yet
light
and
creamy
its
as
thick
as
it
can
be
without
being
overpowering
o
way
too
boozy
this
would
probably
benefit
from
aging
and
become
a
completely
different
beer
bottom
line
very
good
beer
the
best
ive
had
from
arcadia
o
a
decent
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
great
bourbon
flavor
is
accompanied
by
a
nice
chocolate
and
toffee
flavor
but
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
i
find
myself
wanting
some
roasted
malts
too
speaking
of
shipwrecks
when
will
the
ba
site
finally
get
fixed
overall
the
base
beer
for
this
is
a
little
weak
great
barrel
aging
the
whiskey
really
shines
but
im
a
little
disappointed
with
the
base
porter
o
solid
ba
beer
but
not
the
best
good
standing
b
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
the
flavor
profile
was
a
little
lighter
and
mellower
than
i
prefer
but
that
actually
made
it
drink
away
very
quickly
a
bigger
fuller
palate
on
this
one
and
you
could
have
a
real
winner
on
your
hands
thanks
again
for
the
trade
doodler
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
porter
recommended
this
beer
is
weird
i
figured
the
baltic
in
this
porter
would
be
bigger
instead
this
taste
like
a
regular
porter
with
bourbon
without
the
alcohol
in
taste
and
scent
i
dont
know
but
at
7
beans
a
bottle
not
again
for
me
glad
to
try
it
id
had
this
at
a
tasting
after
i
bought
the
bottle
when
it
was
fresh
and
wasnt
terribly
impressed
allowing
this
to
cellar
a
year
mellowed
it
and
calmed
some
of
the
tanginess
that
had
given
the
fresher
version
an
almost
sour
taste
a
very
good
beer
that
at
12
i
will
be
sipping
quite
slow
this
was
so
much
more
muted
than
i
expected
which
was
good
and
bad
the
bourbon
isnt
in
your
face
but
then
again
i
kept
waiting
for
something
to
really
stand
out
and
nothing
really
did
maybe
it
mellowed
from
aging
regardless
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
and
the
easy
drinkability
had
some
major
appeal
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
overall
a
real
nice
sipping
bourbon
barrel
aged
porter
that
i
was
super
stoked
to
try
on
tap
nice
beer
would
easily
drink
again
best
sipped
o
it
may
not
be
williamsburg
alewerks
bb
porter
but
its
damn
close
arcadia
has
crafted
what
might
as
well
be
called
a
russian
imperial
stout
as
this
has
the
abv
and
feel
of
said
big
brews
this
is
a
solid
barrel
aged
offering
and
one
i
have
no
qualms
recommending
moreys
bottom
line
ive
had
other
ba
porters
recently
and
this
one
is
the
best
yet
the
alcohol
is
actually
hidden
quite
well
for
12
its
definitely
a
big
beer
and
a
sipper
but
im
really
enjoying
this
one
my
favorite
beer
from
arcadia
thus
far
i
enjoyed
this
but
its
a
bit
too
pricey
for
a
12oz
bottle
12
alcohol
would
prevent
me
from
having
another
one
anyway
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
a
very
good
baltic
porter
from
arcadia
im
glad
i
had
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
i
only
wish
i
had
one
more
to
see
how
it
mellows
out
after
a
year
delicious
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
the
barrel
character
really
kills
on
the
nose
with
this
one
but
doesnt
quite
translate
to
the
flavor
still
a
really
nice
beer
though
id
definitely
have
this
again
o
a
really
fantastic
beer
by
arcadia
this
doesnt
quite
reach
the
pinnacle
of
my
favorite
barrelaged
stouts
but
its
not
a
stout
i
love
when
brewers
barrel
age
beers
that
are
out
of
the
ordinary
and
arcadia
really
does
a
great
job
with
this
i
have
never
had
this
beer
aged
so
i
am
glad
i
have
one
to
lay
down
for
at
least
a
year
to
see
how
it
changes
o
overall
a
very
solid
offering
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
but
doesnt
necessarily
blow
me
away
i
dont
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
any
extended
cellaring
so
drink
up
4
0
o
this
would
seem
to
be
a
heat
bomb
with
the
bourbon
but
its
not
drinks
nicely
as
it
warms
up
a
solid
porter
one
of
my
favorites
overall
damn
this
is
good
huge
but
not
outrageous
doesnt
burn
you
with
alcohol
like
the
founders
better
half
i
had
before
this
big
balanced
delicious
is
this
really
arcadia
o
a
phenomenal
beer
well
crafted
refined
enjoyable
and
pretty
drinkable
for
a
sipper
using
a
baltic
porter
for
this
base
beer
adds
levels
of
complexity
it
was
highly
recommended
to
me
and
id
do
the
same
to
anyone
else
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
bourbon
accents
and
compliments
the
flavors
and
the
flavors
are
great
overall
boy
does
that
bourbon
barrel
work
wonders
with
beer
awesome
brew
wouldnt
put
it
up
with
the
creme
de
la
creme
of
bb
ales
but
would
nurse
one
on
a
biting
winter
night
anytime
beer
is
12
and
it
lets
you
know
very
strong
aggressive
thick
up
front
sweet
very
sweet
finish
thins
but
isnt
dry
it
is
a
little
too
boozy
for
me
but
it
is
a
fine
beer
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
was
not
so
overpowering
with
the
bourbon
flavors
and
scents
the
aging
did
what
it
was
supposed
to
which
was
to
mellow
the
malts
and
hops
yet
bring
out
some
of
the
flavor
characteristics
of
what
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
on
its
own
oglad
to
finally
try
this
one
more
solid
ba
beer
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
coca
cola
brown
that
turns
to
black
as
it
pools
in
my
glass
it
has
a
soft
and
creamy
beige
colored
lacing
the
aromas
are
full
of
barrel
it
features
a
lot
of
sweet
vanilla
and
sweet
bourbon
the
sweetness
is
high
enough
to
overpower
any
chocolate
or
coffee
that
would
normally
be
present
if
youre
looking
for
a
lot
of
barrel
sweetness
though
this
is
your
thing
the
flavors
begin
with
a
boatload
of
vanilla
then
heads
into
light
bourbon
sweet
cream
toffee
smooth
chocolate
and
whipping
cream
its
a
big
improvement
from
the
nose
and
features
a
lot
of
complexity
im
quite
impressed
the
flavors
are
just
so
creamy
and
smooth
and
perfectly
integrated
the
aftertaste
is
phenomenal
like
creamed
coffee
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
doesnt
show
the
12
at
all
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
barrel
aging
is
really
nice
and
adds
good
complexity
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
overall
pretty
good
excellent
ba
flavors
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
prominent
barrel
character
that
is
nicely
integrated
into
the
flavor
of
the
base
beer
dry
and
spicy
with
toasted
oak
vanilla
and
a
blast
of
sweet
bourbon
that
has
boozy
flavor
without
much
heat
im
not
sure
what
kind
of
barrels
they
use
but
the
bourbon
flavor
is
really
nice
although
this
beer
is
heavy
on
the
bourbon
flavor
its
far
from
one
dimensional
with
lots
of
rich
malt
flavor
underneath
toasty
with
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
oatmeal
theres
some
subtle
heat
with
nice
warmth
in
the
finish
but
overall
the
high
abv
is
very
well
masked
its
nice
to
have
a
ba
beer
thats
not
a
complete
bourbonbooze
bomb
but
its
definitely
still
a
sipper
highly
enjoyable
o
excellent
use
of
barrels
this
is
very
rewarding
for
anyone
that
likes
this
styleeveryone
nowadays
i
really
wish
arcadia
wasnt
just
distributed
to
odd
places
here
and
therenot
anywhere
near
central
ohio
well
ok
maybe
just
this
beer
well
worth
the
higher
price
tag
overall
this
is
very
tasty
and
very
complex
drinkability
is
fairly
low
but
to
be
honest
i
dont
often
get
into
the
12
abv
range
too
often
bottle
found
in
mi
on
my
last
trip
out
there
not
cheap
at
about
512oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
tan
rich
aroma
of
molassess
oak
barrel
bourbon
and
light
roast
medium
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
not
only
adds
flavor
but
seems
to
also
thin
out
the
body
a
little
bit
booze
roast
and
then
back
to
bourbon
this
one
just
seems
it
needs
to
mellow
out
a
bit
as
it
is
pretty
hot
right
now
some
lace
overall
this
is
definitely
a
solid
beer
if
a
bit
overpowering
as
i
noted
my
thoughts
are
that
this
could
use
a
bit
more
time
to
let
the
bourbon
and
booziness
subside
a
little
o
a
good
porter
i
like
a
little
more
out
of
specialrelease
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
is
a
good
one
arcadia
knocks
this
one
out
of
the
park
the
barrel
aging
adds
to
and
enhances
the
other
flavors
mellow
smooth
bourbon
throughout
thats
about
as
good
as
it
gets
a
must
seek
out
o
this
is
a
killer
beer
as
already
mentioned
i
love
porters
and
i
love
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
is
very
well
done
its
a
very
well
integrated
beer
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
to
keep
in
my
cellar
and
no
disrespect
but
i
cant
understand
reviews
that
say
this
is
hit
and
needs
time
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
ba
beers
ive
ever
had
id
drink
this
regularly
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
i
can
see
how
some
might
think
the
alcohol
is
too
prominent
but
it
works
for
me
i
like
how
they
balanced
out
all
of
these
rich
flavors
however
had
to
pay
7
00
in
michigan
mind
you
for
this
one
probably
wont
be
doing
that
again
overall
great
evening
sipper
o
i
think
i
found
a
challenger
to
barrel
aged
gonzo
and
a
worthy
one
at
that
this
is
an
incredibly
balanced
and
tasty
beer
especially
for
being
a
12
barrelaged
porter
o
a
nice
night
capper
alcohol
a
bit
too
apparent
but
this
is
still
pretty
young
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
after
letting
it
sit
for
awhile
the
reveal
what
ba
shipwreck
porter
by
arcadia
ales
awesome
i
havent
had
this
before
but
what
a
treat
thanks
alewatcher
simply
delicious
this
might
not
be
a
mind
blower
but
it
always
satisfies
nice
beer
by
arcadia
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
dark
black
color
with
light
lace
head
smells
are
creamy
bourbon
vanilla
butterscotch
and
raisin
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
molasses
bourbon
cream
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
alcohol
is
masked
extremely
well
this
is
delicious
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
i
am
very
impressed
never
thought
id
see
this
on
the
shelf
at
my
local
stores
much
less
in
relative
abundance
it
pours
a
nearly
onyx
blackbrown
topped
by
a
minor
bit
of
dirty
ash
foam
the
nose
comprises
bourbon
oak
light
roasted
malts
and
a
dusting
of
cocoa
powder
theres
some
minor
heat
in
the
background
but
not
enough
to
warm
the
nose
uncomfortably
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
light
molasses
and
a
distinctive
heavy
touch
of
licorice
the
licorice
detracts
a
bit
with
its
strength
rather
than
helping
things
by
blending
in
better
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
come
all
the
way
together
for
me
d
satisfactory
is
a
good
descriptor
for
this
one
im
not
astounded
but
it
makes
me
want
to
check
out
more
barrelaged
porters
birth
of
tragedy
where
are
you
this
porter
mouthfeel
integrated
with
bourbon
is
a
solid
combination
o
really
impressed
with
this
beer
havent
had
anything
from
arcadia
and
was
excited
to
try
this
ba
porter
for
the
first
time
the
bourbon
is
very
nice
in
this
beer
not
very
balanced
overall
a
lot
of
heat
as
it
goes
down
overall
really
impressed
this
is
worth
a
shot
folks
this
porter
works
quite
well
tastes
great
and
for
12
percent
is
a
nice
sipper
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
an
expensive
one
but
well
worth
it
im
pretty
sure
ive
had
the
regular
version
of
this
but
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
the
ba
version
is
quite
nice
and
what
a
way
to
start
off
the
blind
bif
for
me
overall
decent
but
to
much
burbon
flavor
for
my
liking
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
barrelaging
can
do
recommended
but
not
worth
seeking
out
1012oz
its
good
but
not
as
good
as
it
gets
o
too
thin
and
not
as
smooth
or
balanced
as
i
would
like
very
smooth
for
a
beer
this
heavy
in
abv
carbonation
is
well
suited
to
it
keeps
a
medium
to
heavy
body
rather
sweet
alcohol
burn
really
builds
in
the
back
of
your
throat
but
otherwise
alcohol
is
not
really
a
big
factor
good
stuff
overall
the
bourbon
is
clearly
noticeable
throughout
each
sip
and
i
am
pretty
sure
it
was
the
brewers
intention
to
make
it
overtly
noticeable
this
is
definitely
a
pleasant
sipper
almost
comparable
to
bourbon
county
stout
although
i
like
that
a
bit
better
o
just
impressive
really
good
beer
something
i
would
want
to
get
again
as
a
good
example
of
what
a
ba
beer
should
be
get
the
notes
of
the
base
beer
and
the
barrel
takes
it
to
another
level
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
my
first
barrel
aged
porter
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
very
impressed
this
is
an
unbelievably
good
beer
o
really
nice
for
12
the
alcohol
was
held
in
check
very
nicely
and
the
bourbon
added
some
nice
depth
this
was
a
very
nice
surprise
especially
considering
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
can
have
anywhere
from
a
lot
of
bourbon
to
not
enough
shipwreck
achieves
a
great
balance
with
plenty
of
other
flavors
coming
through
thanks
again
matt
this
porter
leaves
me
wanting
another
limited
availability
and
price
will
likely
rule
out
a
second
this
is
one
amazing
porter
ok
i
was
indifferent
to
this
beer
because
ive
never
had
a
good
beer
from
arcadia
this
one
is
excellent
so
color
me
surprised
not
a
ton
of
depth
but
the
barrel
aging
mouthfeel
were
exquisitely
done
perhaps
time
to
give
em
a
second
chance
drink
and
overall
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
dragons
milk
from
new
holland
i
enjoy
them
but
can
become
a
bit
cloying
and
overly
sweet
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
really
make
this
beer
stand
out
though
o
this
stuff
is
pretty
awesome
i
love
big
bourbon
bombs
but
this
was
nice
and
well
rounded
wish
i
had
some
more
i
had
this
beer
once
it
was
given
to
me
as
an
extra
if
you
can
believe
it
pours
near
black
with
a
brown
head
nose
has
big
malts
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
so
does
the
taste
it
is
really
nice
well
balanced
medium
to
full
body
drinks
nicely
i
really
like
what
they
did
with
the
barrels
by
putting
the
beer
in
them
i
need
more
o
despite
a
few
faults
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
high
alcohol
was
hidden
well
and
the
flavors
were
delicious
and
smooth
its
not
my
favorite
but
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
thanks

still
the
flavors
are
there
and
its
pretty
drinkable
for
its
strength
o
this
is
a
really
solid
porter
and
a
nice
treat
the
alcohol
has
blended
nicely
and
the
barrel
is
really
shining
in
this
without
the
bourbon
being
over
pouring
i
recommend
o
4
o
a
heck
of
a
beer
o
a
very
delicious
imperial
porter
id
buy
this
again
in
a
second
close
to
full
bodied
a
light
level
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
its
an
easy
brew
to
sip
on
well
done
arcadia
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
barrel
aged
beer
nice
bourbon
comes
through
but
doesnt
overpower
and
plenty
of
vanilla
and
caramel
to
it
as
well
would
love
to
get
some
more
bottles
of
this
one
thank
you
so
very
much
to
kevinv
for
this
as
an
extra
in
our
past
trade
really
cant
express
how
happy
i
am
with
the
extras
you
sent
me
and
how
happy
i
am
to
be
able
to
try
this
beer
o
delicious
brew
i
had
never
heard
of
this
one
but
it
was
worth
the
10
or
whatever
i
paid
not
super
balanced
as
the
bourbon
takes
over
and
there
isnt
a
malt
profile
to
take
it
on
its
complex
and
delicious
and
i
didnt
expect
better
overall
a
nicely
crafted
ba
porter
that
is
worthy
of
a
try
by
any
beeradvocate
o
the
very
best
arcadia
has
to
offer
love
it
i
hope
it
get
released
again
o
after
i
got
this
bottle
in
a
trade
a
couple
of
months
ago
only
then
did
i
here
the
great
buzz
surrounding
it
believe
me
that
good
buzz
is
more
than
warranted
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
that
hangs
out
indefinitely
leaving
some
nice
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
vanilla
oak
roast
and
booze
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
blending
beautifully
soft
on
the
palate
this
beer
goes
down
smoothly
easy
to
drink
with
alcohol
presence
less
than
expected
for
a
12
brew
overall
a
terrific
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
i
definitely
recommend
it
o
i
like
it
the
12
is
hidden
decently
well
i
think
there
is
more
booze
in
the
smell
than
the
taste
and
the
booze
that
does
hit
the
mouth
is
more
towards
the
finish
a
good
consistency
and
good
flavor
that
features
the
bourbon
nicely
i
havent
had
the
base
beer
before
and
wonder
how
much
flavor
it
has
since
it
was
pretty
muted
but
overall
a
good
beer
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
because
they
often
end
up
being
too
bourbony
this
one
manages
to
bring
a
fair
amount
of
bourbon
character
while
still
maintaining
its
integrity
as
a
porter
if
it
had
anymore
bourbon
character
it
would
probably
be
too
much
for
me
but
as
it
stands
its
pretty
damn
tasty
a
little
hot
right
now
but
in
a
year
or
two
i
imagine
this
would
be
drinking
perfectly
deep
mahogany
black
thin
kahki
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
this
thing
just
screams
bourbon
which
immediately
lures
me
in
i
cant
say
ive
had
a
barrel
aged
porter
like
this
before
but
im
digging
it
already
thick
molasses
and
sap
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
and
a
lingering
but
very
tolerable
slap
to
the
back
of
the
throat
make
this
a
delicious
sipper
as
it
warms
it
becomes
so
balanced
despite
the
abv
and
bourbon
i
really
dont
think
it
could
get
much
better
truly
tasty
as
hell
this
beer
pours
a
deep
black
with
very
slight
brown
edging
almost
no
head
formation
or
lacing
a
little
bit
of
mocha
brown
but
didnt
linger
nice
deep
bourbon
nose
slight
burn
helpful
vanilla
oak
and
molasses
taste
is
much
the
same
quite
strong
bourbon
flavour
accompanied
by
the
vanilla
and
molasses
some
currants
and
slight
hop
citric
tang
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
warming
but
decently
smooth
overall
a
tasty
brew
liked
that
waxed
cap
wish
i
had
another
for
the
cellar
pours
completely
pitch
black
with
not
a
chance
of
any
light
coming
through
a
frothy
whitetan
head
lovingly
crowns
the
beer
smells
bourbon
easily
dominate
the
nose
with
some
malt
contributing
to
the
overall
aroma
first
sip
is
bitter
with
a
plenty
of
bourbon
notes
taking
charge
chocolate
vanilla
and
some
dark
fruits
plum
in
particular
are
present
mouthfeel
really
makes
his
beer
rock
it
is
super
creamy
and
worth
noting
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
fairly
thick
body
for
the
style
abv
is
well
hidden
this
is
world
class
worthy
of
being
sought
out
simply
flawless
six
ounces
of
this
would
have
been
quite
enough
and
quite
gratifying
o
delicious
and
quenching
considering
very
sweet
but
welcome
and
it
is
balanced
well

overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
ive
never
heard
of
arcadia
brewing
before
this
but
this
beer
is
well
executed
and
delivers
for
the
style
all
of
the
components
are
well
balanced
and
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
12
abv
i
could
easily
finish
a
12
oz
bottle
by
myself
and
wouldnt
mind
having
another
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
two
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
lots
of
flavors
all
of
them
good
drink
this
was
damn
good
it
was
smooth
silky
boozy
and
flavorful
a
welcome
addition
to
a
nice
small
tasting
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
pours
black
with
a
very
very
thin
light
tan
head
a
few
spots
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
though
they
dont
stick
half
a
cap
as
well
the
nose
carries
a
nice
smooth
bourbon
presence
along
with
some
chocolate
and
roast
touch
of
coffee
along
with
some
light
oak
and
vanilla
ubersmooth
the
barrel
character
really
shines
in
the
flavor
and
carries
a
good
amount
of
vanilla
and
light
chocolate
with
it
good
moderate
roast
in
the
background
and
a
bit
of
oak
and
accompanying
tannin
on
the
backend
and
through
the
finish
medium
chewy
body
with
low
carbonation
and
a
really
nice
creaminess
barrelaging
well
done
arcadia
solid
brew
that
id
love
to
have
ready
access
to
hv
this
is
a
really
nice
ba
porter
though
you
really
need
to
like
bourbon
to
enjoy
it
luckily
im
a
bourbon
fan
so
this
one
worked
for
me
in
general
not
in
the
league
of
the
best
baltic
porters
but
still
a
great
effort
from
arcadia
great
tasting
beer
that
i
had
not
really
had
on
my
radar
before
receiving
it
in
a
trade
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
bourbon
oak
and
milk
chocolate
medium
to
full
bodied
with
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
bourbon
vanilla
oak
and
roasted
malt
excellent
notes
nice
and
rich
barrel
aged
offering
for
what
is
paid
typically
for
these
types
of
brews
the
qualityprice
ration
is
quite
phenomenal
and
made
me
immediately
think
of
why
i
did
not
have
a
few
more
of
these
bottles
around
lesson
learned
for
next
time
the
bourbon
aging
and
blending
has
worked
well
here
maybe
not
as
nicely
as
the
nose
but
a
very
recommendable
brew
in
any
case
flavors
are
similarly
muted
drowned
out
by
a
steamrolling
astringency
and
a
deadening
alcoholic
presence
some
vague
vanilla
roasty
malt
and
boozy
barrel
elements
body
is
oddly
thin
and
boozy
also
seems
like
the
alcohol
got
a
little
too
rampant
the
barrel
obliterated
the
nuances
of
the
original
porter
wafting
heat
rises
off
the
palate
leaving
a
bone
dry
finish
with
some
lingering
roast
malt
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
lacks
nuance
and
depth
not
something
id
revisit
or
consider
all
that
successful
overall
more
body
and
less
alcohol
would
definitely
improve
things
pours
a
nice
clear
brown
with
an
orangish
reddish
tint
and
a
nice
solid
light
brown
head
very
pretty
pour
smells
bourbon
heavy
on
the
nose
lots
of
vanilla
and
oak
on
the
nose
and
tongue
the
malt
backbone
is
subtle
and
almost
none
existant
on
the
tongue
the
oak
hits
first
and
strongest
with
some
light
vanilla
undertones
the
booziness
hits
a
bit
hard
but
overall
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
this
was
a
stellar
barrel
aged
porter
thanks
john
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
after
not
expecting
a
whole
lot
based
on
previous
experiences
with
arcadia
a
well
done
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
that
somehow
is
strangely
prickly
on
the
tongue
big
alcohol
influence
and
lots
of
flavoring
in
this
for
12
abv
it
is
integrated
quite
nice
a
mighty
fine
sipper
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
picked
through
the
flavors
of
this
beer
and
it
was
complex
enough
that
i
feel
that
i
still
missed
out
on
some
nuances
because
of
how
much
i
enjoyed
and
concentrated
on
the
barrel
aging
characteristics
if
i
see
this
around
i
plan
on
buying
it
again
has
a
licorice
and
nut
smell
right
off
the
bat
almost
a
barleywine
influence
on
it
pours
a
thin
looking
black
with
just
a
touch
of
a
white
head
taste
is
about
in
line
with
the
smell
and
has
some
nuts
and
other
earth
things
in
with
the
roasted
malts
finishes
a
little
bit
sour
the
beer
is
kind
of
thin
but
this
is
pretty
good
i
wont
buy
tons
more
because
of
the
cost
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
after
the
smell
still
a
good
pickup
though
the
reveal
arcadia
ales
barrelaged
shipwreck
porter
woooo
it
actually
was
a
little
unfair
since
i
was
sent
this
in
a
trade
a
few
months
ago
and
the
wax
looked
familiar
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
though
so
now
i
can
sit
on
my
other
bottle
for
a
little
anyway
pours
black
with
a
very
small
dark
tan
head
the
nose
is
muted
cocoa
oak
and
a
bit
of
a
malty
maybe
smoked
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
combination
of
big
oak
and
a
small
melded
bourbon
heat
cocoa
malts
and
a
finsh
of
bitterness
that
seems
like
a
combination
of
the
50
some
ibus
and
the
tannic
oak
quality
this
beer
isnt
boozy
in
the
same
way
at
ba
beers
can
be
boozy
and
yet
the
big
oak
and
the
bourbon
are
aggressive
its
somewhat
hard
to
explain
how
this
beer
comes
together
but
it
oddly
does
for
me
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
desired
with
reasonable
lower
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
beer
better
than
what
i
described
below
it
does
come
together
pretty
nicely
this
is
very
drinkable
i
need
to
force
myself
to
take
my
time
drinking
this
one
so
easy
to
drink
if
drunk
too
fast
however
id
surely
miss
out
on
the
wonderful
changes
this
beer
goes
through
in
the
45
minutes
i
had
with
it
o
this
actually
reminded
me
of
rahrs
ba
winter
warmer
i
have
a
feeling
the
beer
was
only
aged
for
around
3
months
in
the
barrels
like
the
rahr
beer
its
tasty
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
would
love
to
see
it
aged
a
bit
longer
in
the
barrels
to
get
more
of
that
charred
oak
and
bourbon
flavor
in
there
my
suggestion
is
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
you
have
it
available
but
keep
your
expectations
grounded
one
of
the
few
barrel
aged
beers
that
i
can
say
that
the
barrel
aging
actually
mellows
the
beer
a
very
good
beer
pours
black
with
dark
brown
edges
and
topped
with
a
thin
mocha
head
dissipates
quickly
and
recedes
leaving
little
lace
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
pretty
good
notes
of
bourbon
oak
coffee
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
i
pick
up
bourbon
immediately
and
it
follows
up
with
more
coffee
chocolate
caramel
plus
some
black
licorice
this
beer
is
medium
to
full
in
body
and
carbed
on
the
low
side
this
ale
was
a
tasty
treat
i
will
seek
more
for
aging
and
maturing
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
it
kind
of
loses
its
identity
as
a
porter
through
excessive
alcohol
presence
ill
let
one
sit
for
a
year
then
give
it
another
shot
the
bitterness
is
about
right
but
could
be
a
little
less
the
malts
are
singing
a
rich
aria
in
this
beer
sloshy
and
thick
i
want
to
just
bask
in
their
roasty
sweet
side
tone
the
bitterness
down
one
tick
and
this
is
a
5
pours
great
with
a
deep
rich
color
lighter
towards
the
top
and
bottom
the
head
is
lightly
colored
and
stays
for
a
good
amount
of
time
the
smell
blew
me
away
smells
like
a
great
bourbon
with
vanilla
and
a
slight
hint
of
oak
and
smokeyness
followed
by
a
hit
of
alcohol
vanilla
chocolate
espresso
oak
and
a
buttery
taste
are
all
blended
magnificently
with
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavors
shining
through
the
most
the
feel
when
drinking
is
phenomenal
it
lingers
and
leaves
the
tastes
to
dance
upon
your
taste
buds
this
is
such
a
great
beer
and
the
best
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
o
a
good
but
not
great
beer
the
bourbon
notes
are
wellbalanced
so
that
they
dont
become
too
sweet
or
boozy
but
i
really
wish
i
could
get
more
from
the
porter
that
went
into
the
barrels
o
overall
a
solid
beer
good
bourbon
character
the
nose
keeps
getting
better
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
arcadia
happy
ive
got
another
to
sit
on
the
edges
may
round
a
bit
with
a
year
or
two
bottle
to
shifter
anyone
who
gives
this
beer
less
than
an
a
is
flat
out
wrong
unless
they
dont
like
the
type
in
which
case
they
shouldnt
be
drinking
it
in
the
first
place
the
beer
is
dark
and
robust
in
color
smell
is
good
with
malt
and
bourbon
present
tastes
great
all
the
great
characteristics
of
a
porter
souped
up
from
bourbon
barreling
mouthfeel
is
good
definitely
a
sipping
beer
enjoy
at
stoutlike
temperature
this
beer
is
excellent
im
not
sure
how
it
had
flown
under
my
radar
especially
being
from
swmi
and
very
familiar
with
arcadia
but
it
had
past
tense
ill
be
going
back
for
more
soon
just
to
make
sure
i
can
hold
on
to
a
few
for
special
occasions
o
what
the
hell
is
this
beer
how
have
i
never
heard
of
this
delicious
beer
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
especially
considering
it
is
a
ba
brew
available
offtheshelf
d
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
arcadia
id
be
curious
to
try
this
beer
at
earlier
stages
in
the
barrelaging
to
see
how
much
bourbon
presence
there
was
initially
a
nice
12oz
treat
thats
perfect
for
a
nightcap
o
i
loved
this
just
a
wonderful
porter
great
tasting
will
need
more
and
soon
12oz
bottle
picked
up
at
binnys
across
from
goose
island
this
one
pours
an
inky
dark
brown
color
there
was
just
a
wisp
of
a
tan
head
that
went
away
immediately
the
nose
is
quite
good
only
traces
of
the
bourbon
i
also
get
caramel
chocolate
some
vanilla
roastiness
and
some
faint
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
good
a
good
integration
of
the
caramel
and
bourbon
with
the
latter
only
mildly
showing
up
in
the
aftertaste
hardly
any
sweetness
at
all
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
some
roasted
notes
chocolate
nothing
really
overpowering
or
standing
out
a
bit
of
a
subtle
complexity
to
it
id
buy
another
well
ive
had
shipwreck
porter
a
few
times
but
ive
never
really
cared
for
it
and
never
even
put
my
thoughts
down
on
it
here
goes
a
12
ounce
of
the
barrel
aged
12
version
pours
a
pitch
black
hue
with
a
thicket
of
tan
head
dwindles
slow
and
leaves
chunks
of
scattered
lacing
aroma
has
a
full
on
bourbon
nose
with
hints
of
caramelvanilla
creaminess
dark
roasted
malts
provide
a
touch
of
black
chocolate
but
is
pretty
much
overshadowed
by
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
touch
of
oak
and
strong
sweet
bourbon
notes
im
thinking
you
really
have
to
love
bourbon
to
drink
this
beer
to
compare
this
to
kbs
is
unfair
two
totally
different
types
of
bba
beers
flavor
is
full
of
intense
booze
and
bourbon
flavors
that
12
percent
is
packing
some
heat
instead
of
abv
i
feel
like
i
should
be
talking
what
proof
this
is
the
base
porter
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
barrel
it
totally
absorbs
all
of
the
bourbon
barreal
effects
inlcuding
toastedcharred
oak
sweet
bourbon
hints
of
vanillacaramelized
dark
sugars
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
low
im
sure
alot
is
lost
during
barrel
aging
head
formed
nicely
though
im
not
calling
this
flat
in
anyway
a
warming
effect
with
each
sip
from
the
12
percent
abv
or
24
proof
overall
you
better
like
you
some
bourbon
or
your
not
going
to
care
for
this
particular
beer
i
could
give
a
non
bourbon
drinker
a
kbs
but
if
i
gave
this
one
to
them
they
may
be
a
bit
offended
by
the
straight
up
bourbon
character
if
their
not
used
to
it
one
of
the
better
baltics
ive
had
in
a
while
only
drawback
is
that
it
is
a
bit
warm
yet
this
should
age
pretty
well
id
guess
o
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
bourbon
barrel
porter
its
a
little
too
boozy
and
thinbodied
and
the
bourbon
flavor
comes
up
a
little
short
an
outstanding
base
beer
flavor
probably
could
have
overcome
the
other
shortcomings
but
the
base
beer
also
isnt
incredible
a
good
beer
i
betcha
with
8
months
to
a
year
for
the
heat
to
smooth
out
this
will
be
sublime
if
you
get
some
only
drink
one
now
for
referance
and
bust
them
open
next
spring
or
2
falls
from
now
i
expect
great
things
bottle
into
darkness
tulip
black
with
brown
edges
and
a
tiny
brown
cap
that
fades
quickly
to
a
collar
smell
is
cheap
bourbon
sweet
oak
artificial
fruit
flavored
candy
some
dark
roasted
malts
taste
is
much
different
slightly
brash
oak
flavor
at
first
vanilla
toasted
oak
alcohol
bourbon
finishing
with
a
hot
burn
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thin
with
a
medium
carbonation
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
certainly
not
worth
7
for
a
12oz
bottle
definitley
a
bit
hot
and
overcaronated
maybe
this
will
get
better
with
a
little
time
overall
one
of
the
best
ba
porters
ive
had
i
like
while
ive
sampled
a
number
of
barrel
aged
stouts
this
a
first
barrel
aged
porter
for
me
the
difference
was
quite
evident
in
a
lighter
body
and
mouthfeel
than
the
stouts
usually
carry
the
bourbon
note
was
pronounced
but
not
overbearing
some
wellmoderated
sweetness
in
the
malt
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
some
faint
vanilla
notes
alchohol
was
very
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
overall
nice
beer
just
needs
more
backbone
with
a
thicker
body
it
reminds
me
of
a
doppelbock
and
its
dangerously
drinkable
no
much
booziness
considering
it
being
12
seek
this
out
but
go
easy
o
this
was
excellent
and
incredibly
easy
drinking
at
no
point
in
taste
or
smell
was
i
aware
of
the
12
abv
i
would
seek
this
out
again
excellent
beer
thanks
to
cetherid
for
the
assist
overall
not
really
my
thing
as
i
prefer
barrel
aging
that
is
alot
more
subtle
however
for
what
this
is
a
big
barrel
dominated
brew
it
is
pretty
solid
i
would
drink
this
one
again
if
it
was
available
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
such
a
complex
mix
of
flavors
also
the
the
alcohol
is
not
nearly
as
hot
as
you
might
expect
for
the
high
abv
overall
i
feel
this
rich
mix
of
flavors
would
work
better
in
a
stout
than
this
porter
o
very
easy
to
drink
gonna
get
a
few
bottles
before
i
leave
today
well
put
together
and
would
serve
as
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
or
in
another
vein
a
great
introductory
beer
for
a
newcomer
to
the
barrel
aged
style
very
accessible
overall
as
far
as
barrel
aged
beers
go
you
can
get
much
better
then
this
strong
whiskey
flavor
mixed
into
a
porter
really
makes
a
fine
beer
a
total
sipper
at
12
one
and
done
for
sure
a
real
treat
and
worth
finding
in
a
bottle
this
beer
drinks
like
an
8er
nothing
to
complain
about
at
all
o
this
beer
is
better
than
average
but
was
highly
disappointing
given
the
high
expectations
i
had
on
this
i
wish
i
had
not
bought
two
bottles
o
its
currently
one
of
my
favorites
that
i
have
revisited
multiple
times
i
have
the
cellar
stocked
with
20
of
these
gems
and
will
likely
reduce
that
number
in
half
by
the
time
i
have
arbitrarily
set
as
what
i
feel
will
be
the
next
time
i
will
revisit
the
aged
version
of
this
beer
a
year
from
now
my
one
main
hope
for
perfection
of
this
brew
is
to
tame
the
oak
flavors
that
seem
to
be
a
little
overpowering
to
the
vanilla
which
is
the
most
pleasant
flavor
of
this
beer
this
is
drinkable
considering
the
12
percent
abv
the
carbonation
can
be
a
bit
jarring
at
first
but
thats
to
be
expected
from
a
beer
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
offering
expensive
but
good
overall
an
outstanding
beer
the
richness
and
12
abv
really
make
this
a
sipper
12
ounces
was
plenty
for
me
at
a
sitting
o
really
heavy
on
the
barrel
but
nice
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
impressive
to
say
the
least
really
hard
to
find
any
flaws
in
this
one
going
to
have
to
grab
a
couple
more
to
cellar
i
think
a
year
might
turn
this
into
an
outstanding
beer
recommend
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
jcnd9803
pours
near
balck
with
thin
khaki
head
aroma
has
lots
of
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
and
some
wood
taste
is
semisweetnot
as
much
as
the
noseand
it
has
some
roasty
bitterness
the
flavors
are
complex
with
wood
vanilla
dark
pit
fruit
and
some
coffee
stealing
the
show
the
bourbon
is
not
as
pronounced
as
i
would
have
thought
through
the
aroma
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
woody
finish
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
edit
i
just
had
the
latest
batch
from
late
2011
and
it
was
just
as
good
with
a
slightly
better
aroma
but
the
wax
was
much
thicker
and
harder
to
remove
opening
this
beer
was
a
bitch
but
it
still
one
of
my
favorite
barrel
aged
stouts
it
is
so
smooth
and
drinkable
you
would
never
think
it
is
12
simply
one
awesome
brew
medium
body
with
a
great
lighter
carbonation
which
works
very
well
for
this
style
alcohol
is
felt
but
not
at
the
expected
level
for
the
strength
the
barrel
aging
added
some
wonderful
character
without
dominating
seems
pretty
dry
but
that
may
be
the
only
thing
i
can
say
awesome
beer
here
heavy
bodied
but
also
heavily
carbonated
somewhat
sticky
each
sip
fizzles
in
your
mouth
then
coats
every
inch
less
carbonation
would
have
been
preferred
as
experiencing
more
of
the
beginning
flavors
would
make
for
a
more
enjoyable
tasting
cheers
very
nice
very
complex
brew
nice
bourbon
flavor
just
a
huge
freakin
beer
so
much
going
on
it
is
enjoyable
and
something
i
would
revisit
at
6
a
12oz
bottle
and
12
it
is
a
sipper
but
overall
a
solid
offering
ive
got
another
couple
bottles
that
will
be
interesting
to
taste
down
the
road
md
fullbodied
and
creamy
tangy
and
sharp
for
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
light
throughout
could
be
a
bit
more
crisp
for
me
i
think
i
may
want
a
stronger
roasted
body
it
may
have
a
disconnect
for
me
something
more
fluid
and
more
velvet
i
just
find
myself
wanting
somewhere
the
flavor
is
off
the
hook
but
the
feeling
just
isnt
up
to
par
either
way
good
beer
would
gladly
drink
it
again
all
in
all
it
met
my
expectations
and
i
hope
to
pick
up
several
more
bottles
for
special
occasions
a
pretty
impressive
barrel
aged
beer
not
quite
up
to
par
with
gi
but
impressive
for
a
relatively
small
brewery
a
little
pricey
per
bottle
but
easier
to
find
then
say
kbs
or
bcbs
if
this
were
thicker
and
a
little
less
heat
this
would
get
a
solid
a
thin
light
tan
head
on
a
completely
black
body
beautiful
aroma
of
bourbon
vanilla
oak
and
some
butterscotch
almost
too
much
going
on
in
the
taste
for
me
to
wrap
my
head
around
sweet
smooth
and
very
drinkable
roasty
and
sweet
followed
by
bourbon
and
bitterness
i
need
to
track
down
more
bottles
of
this
one
asap
drinkability
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
on
the
way
down
and
even
less
in
the
flavor
this
beer
was
just
sent
to
me
and
i
cant
imagine
what
a
year
or
two
on
it
would
do
it
is
already
practically
quaffable
for
how
strong
it
is
i
was
hoping
not
to
be
let
down
by
this
being
a
porter
lover
and
i
was
most
definitely
not
i
would
seek
this
out
in
the
future
for
sure
this
beer
is
just
so
smooth
i
just
took
a
few
minute
break
before
posting
this
to
let
it
warm
up
even
more
and
my
god
does
it
keep
getting
better
as
it
warms
and
with
every
sip
fantastic
overall
not
too
shabby
of
a
porter
i
feel
it
fits
in
the
overpriced
overhyped
categories
that
seem
to
be
about
today
um
what
happened
to
drinkability
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
thin
khaki
head
that
died
away
leaving
just
traces
of
lace
on
the
nose
the
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
are
the
big
three
notes
but
underneath
that
is
a
backbone
of
roasted
malt
some
earthiness
and
a
big
of
booze
in
the
mouth
the
bourbon
takes
up
residence
right
on
the
mid
part
of
the
tongue
and
hangs
around
well
forever
there
is
also
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
and
a
big
oaky
finish
the
alcohol
presence
is
pretty
huge
but
thats
not
something
to
complain
about
with
a
bourbon
barrel
beer
the
feel
is
a
slightly
sticky
medium
body
not
as
thick
as
some
of
the
bigger
stouts
that
seem
heavier
on
oats
coffee
and
chocolate
than
this
beer
overall
i
wish
this
beer
had
just
a
bit
of
a
bigger
backbone
as
the
bourbon
flavors
dominated
the
base
beer
pretty
well
but
the
end
result
is
pretty
great
and
well
worth
seeking
out
d
a
pretty
easy
going
sipper
take
your
time
with
this
one
i
could
see
it
sneaking
up
on
me
if
i
drank
it
too
quickly
this
is
something
i
would
like
to
have
another
of
12
oz
wax
dipped
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
poured
a
deep
brownblack
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
lots
of
whiskey
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
little
alcohol
chocolate
vanilla
in
the
flavor
not
as
much
bourbon
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
long
lingering
finish
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
body
is
a
little
thin
definitely
a
sipper
good
beer
plenty
of
complexity
not
just
a
bunch
of
bourbon
if
this
is
part
of
a
new
tone
from
arcadia
i
am
buying
in
a
nice
subtle
porter
melded
with
bourbon
arcadia
please
make
more
bourbon
barrel
beers
the
most
striking
part
of
the
taste
is
that
the
bourbon
barrel
flavor
is
nearly
perfect
the
full
round
bourbon
vanilla
and
wood
notes
are
front
and
center
but
without
the
heat
that
it
usually
takes
to
get
those
flavors
to
the
fore
there
is
some
bitter
bakers
chocolate
and
sweet
molasses
in
a
supporting
role
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
roast
from
the
parent
beer
here
but
this
is
as
spoton
of
a
barrel
aging
process
as
youre
going
to
find
you
really
get
the
full
character
of
the
barrel
very
well
done
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
you
really
need
to
seek
out
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
would
have
to
really
really
recommend
this
one
d
i
am
totally
blown
away
by
this
barrel
aged
butte
a
nearly
absent
sense
of
alcohol
surprises
me
delightfully
with
each
sip
12
is
this
a
typo
no
no
i
am
definitely
feeling
this
brew
after
a
few
sips
seek
it
out
d
this
really
took
on
the
bourbon
barrel
characters
well
it
rivals
some
imperial
stouts
in
sweetness
and
richness
almost
dessertlike
d
a
great
beer
possibly
the
best
beer
from
arcadia
ive
had
excellent
beer
from
arcadia
definitely
my
favorite
offering
from
them
yet
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
one
piece
that
may
be
off
putting
to
some
is
the
heat
the
heat
is
more
warming
and
pleasant
than
hot
and
boozey
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
beer
a
couple
points
lower
one
worth
seeking
out
if
you
want
the
opportunity
this
is
one
i
will
grab
a
few
more
bottles
of
myself
d
very
drinkable
dangerously
drinkable
for
sure
the
beer
is
nice
and
medium
to
full
bodied
without
being
too
heavy
or
too
light
the
carb
is
a
touch
high
for
me
but
the
mouthfeel
and
consequent
drinkability
score
very
well
probably
the
first
beer
from
arcadia
ive
really
enjoyed
im
picking
up
a
bunch
for
the
cellar
maybe
i
can
then
celebrate
my
birthday
all
year
round
also
i
am
reminded
that
this
is
supposedly
a
baltic
porter
really
i
would
be
expecting
at
least
some
smoke
and
deep
maltiness
humph
d
for
12
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
and
was
enjoyable
in
its
uniqueness
as
a
side
note
battle
creek
has
always
had
a
special
place
in
my
heart
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
never
knew
it
existed
until
a
friend
poured
it
into
my
snifter
appearance
is
thin
with
no
head
smell
is
superb
bourbon
caramel
roasts
booze
smell
is
bourbon
and
vanilla
up
front
and
nice
brown
ale
roastiness
in
the
finish
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
this
is
a
great
after
dinner
nightcap
winterwarmer
type
of
beer
though
not
my
style
i
wonder
if
this
might
be
the
right
place
for
a
cigar
12oz
capped
and
red
waxed
bottle
generously
shared
by
jedwards
to
round
out
the
evening
pours
two
shades
shy
of
black
with
no
head
just
a
soapy
swirl
and
some
residual
suds
nose
expresses
vanilla
coconut
butter
and
artificial
sweetener
on
a
mediumroasted
malty
backbone
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
the
vanilla
is
much
more
prominent
in
the
flavor
profile
than
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
the
artificial
sweetener
present
in
the
nose
and
taste
are
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
nicely
carbonated
very
smooth
thick
but
not
sticky
this
is
drinkable
considering
the
12
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
like
but
it
is
ok
a
valiant
effort
by
arcadia
to
make
an
elite
beer
but
they
dont
quite
make
it
to
the
next
tier
with
this
one
ill
keep
turning
to
their
big
brothers
founders
bells
shorts
when
i
want
something
truly
exceptional
i
had
no
or
low
expectations
for
this
and
came
away
totally
shocked
this
is
the
best
arcadia
beer
out
there
and
a
must
get
wow
da
sipper
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
at
6
a
12oz
bottle
its
not
likely
notes
brilliant
porter
the
barrel
aging
does
kinda
mask
most
of
the
other
porter
elements
but
is
well
received
just
as
barrel
flavor
as
bcs
but
not
as
rich
and
slightly
less
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
drinkability
is
good
in
terms
of
the
size
of
this
brawny
baddy
one
is
easily
consumed
and
loved
up
until
the
last
swallow
but
two
would
be
a
gratuitous
waste
this
brew
is
substantial
and
would
easily
serve
as
a
dessert
brew
expectations
are
surpassed
with
ease
well
done
arcadia
d
this
could
use
some
age
tons
of
bourbon
flavor
that
i
would
like
to
see
mellow
out
in
time
d
i
would
like
several
more
but
at
12
percent
food
match
insulin
is
where
i
would
start
with
this
brew
o
exceptional
perhaps
even
better
than
zywiec
overall
a
complex
beer
to
be
savored
and
sipped
at
warming
temperatures
to
really
appreciate
avb
is
hidden
by
sweetness
not
your
average
porter
well
done
o
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
is
to
be
found
in
this
rich
and
velvety
baltic
porter
smooth
from
start
to
finish
tons
of
sugary
sweetness
develops
as
it
warms
none
of
which
become
a
burden
as
the
dark
malts
and
mysteriously
silent
hops
balance
the
beer
wonderfully
overall
eh
this
is
by
no
means
a
good
beer
it
does
have
an
interesting
nose
and
flavor
that
lean
on
dark
fruits
and
raisins
as
opposed
to
the
common
chocolate
and
malts
interesting
yes
good
no
grand
imperial
porter
stands
out
among
porters
unfortunately
other
porters
are
better
although
nothing
stood
out
here
it
was
still
an
enjoyable
beer
that
ill
go
back
to
as
i
see
it
solid
if
not
outstanding
baltic
porter
cheers
overall
id
say
this
is
a
runofthemill
baltic
here
its
drinkable
does
nothing
to
misrepresent
the
style
but
theres
nothing
special
or
exciting
about
it
highly
doubtful
id
buy
it
again
maybe
a
bit
more
sweet
than
it
should
be
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
but
semi
translucent
dark
red
brown
half
finger
light
tan
head
fizzed
intensely
and
immediately
disappeared
leaving
a
tiny
ring
around
the
glass
unusual
carbonation
behavior
aroma
of
toasted
malt
chocolate
vanilla
and
an
unusual
earthy
fruit
component
flavor
follows
aroma
dark
toasted
malt
chocolate
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
coffee
odd
fruit
flavor
in
the
finish
like
an
herbal
infusion
of
sour
cherry
light
hops
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
an
unusual
porter
with
less
opacity
and
body
than
most
baltic
porters
but
the
toastiness
and
cherry
flavors
are
good
for
a
baltic
porter
the
earthy
fruit
flavor
in
the
finish
does
not
fit
as
well
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
but
somewhat
off
balanced
o
great
beer
recommended
would
have
again
not
very
porterish
at
all
but
still
pretty
nice
perhaps
the
best
polish
ale
ive
tasted
i
am
a
fan
of
imperial
porters
and
saw
this
one
for
1
99
and
couldnt
pass
it
up
i
wish
i
did
this
beer
was
incredibly
sweet
and
bitter
causing
me
to
make
strange
faces
it
was
so
sweet
and
yet
bitter
at
the
same
time
i
thought
i
was
drinking
cough
syrup
i
probably
drank
4
ounces
before
this
beer
became
my
first
ever
drain
pour
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
o
im
still
not
loving
the
nose
but
this
tastes
pretty
good
actually
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
great
drinking
imperial
porter
the
beer
is
almost
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
very
nice
sweetness
with
some
mild
roast
dark
fruit
cola
and
a
bit
of
grain
the
sweetness
is
excellent
almost
doppelbocklike
a
bit
of
cola
some
dark
fruit
and
like
cocoa
powder
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
to
go
with
bread
and
toffee
overall
good
beer
especially
when
you
factor
in
the
it
costs
next
to
nothing
it
definitely
is
better
even
than
some
triple
it
price
and
on
that
note
salud
extremely
well
made
and
balanced
a
dark
profile
without
left
up
the
licorice
might
be
too
much
for
some
overall
man
these
guys
in
poland
got
the
porter
thing
down
if
i
see
this
again
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
another
quite
possibly
the
best
porter
for
your
dollar
o
a
very
mochaforward
porter
well
balanced
smooth
and
rather
fragrant
o
really
not
roasty
enough
for
me
as
a
porter
nor
burntsmoky
enough
for
a
baltic
interesting
malty
offering
though
its
definitely
not
bad
o
a
very
rich
nice
porter
that
cant
be
beat
for
the
cheap
price
tag
doesnt
have
to
much
to
it
to
really
make
it
stand
out
but
good
nonetheless
would
definitely
drink
again
could
use
much
more
carbonation
very
syrupy
body
o
glad
i
drank
it
curious
on
this
beer
after
35
years
as
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
residual
sugars
in
my
bottle
this
beer
should
hold
up
for
510
years
the
taste
seems
like
a
step
down
from
some
of
your
better
polish
baltics
the
cloying
sweetness
is
almost
overpowering
and
there
is
a
chalky
quality
to
the
flavor
that
impedes
the
otherwise
pleasant
tones
of
bakers
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
alcohol
is
also
an
irritant
as
it
strangles
the
finish
despite
mellowing
in
the
aftertaste
not
something
i
would
try
again
with
so
many
easier
to
drink
more
refined
polish
baltics
available
at
a
similar
bargain
price

wise

the

is
overtaken
by

the
taste
was
rather

with
a
decent

but
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
for
a
porter
known
as
a

beer
and
i
think
it
lives
up
to
that
reputation
not
bad
for
the
price
i
actually
couldnt
finish
this
one
lets
not
get
complicated
this
is
a
very
delicious
porter
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
it
tastes
great
period
overall
decent
its
good
for
the
price
as
many
users
have
noted
but
its
a
far
cry
from
being
a
great
brew
it
almost
feels
like
coffee
liqueur
has
been
added
to
a
watery
porter
the
sweetness
detracts
and
i
am
not
enough
of
a
coffee
drinker
to
appreciate
the
only
other
apparent
flavor
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
some
time
if
i
wasnt
so
close
to
deschutes
who
produce
one
of
the
best
porters
there
is
if
you
find
it
at
the
right
distributor
a
great
bang
for
the
buck
well
rounded
full
bodied
impressive
porter
from
poland
a
little
light
bodied
in
my
opinion
for
a
porter
but
tasty
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
normally
like
them
a
bit
more
on
the
malty
side
but
the
high
alcohol
content
gave
it
a
nice
punch
at
1
99
per
this
just
became
my
winter
session
beer
it
sounds
like
a
70s
blacksploitation
film
goes
down
just
as
hard
and
satisfies
the
same
way
too
very
smooth
drinking
baltic
porter
from
poland
this
beer
drinks
very
smooth
and
not
heavy
at
all
has
a
bit
of
very
light
sweetness
to
it
but
not
over
powering
so
it
stays
pleasant
i
had
this
in
the
smaller
11
2
ounce
bottle
and
i
didnt
see
an
alcohol
content
shown
if
this
beer
is
9

abv
its
masked
very
well
the
last
time
i
drank
this
beer
i
picked
up
four
of
them
i
like
this
beer
and
will
drink
it
again
reminds
me
of
samuel
smiths
imperial
stout
only
not
as
refined
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
warning
dont
keep
it
super
cold
otherwise
it
comes
out
almost
flat
with
no
head
nose
is
that
of
a
mocha
spirit
like
a
godiva
liqueur
fused
with
whiskey
or
bourbon
even
dark

solid
mocha
starttofinish
because
not

bargain
for

good
stuff
i
spent
summers
on
my
grandmothers
dairy
coffee
and
sugarcane
farm
this
porter
reminds
me
of
what
the
giant
pots
we
made
melcocha
in
smelled
like
after
boiling
down
the
cane
juice
i
understand
this
smell
now
whereas
i
used
to
confuse
it
with
soy
sauce
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
porter
9

need
i
say
more
excellent
strong
beer
and
smooth
has
the
baltic
porter
become
an
overlooked
style
dont
say
that
to
the
black
boss
which
is
a
more
than
fair
representation
of
the
style
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
these
are
usually
relatively
cheap
in
bottles
2
for
a
pint
and
are
a
fantastic
value
most
craft
pint
bottles
are
far
more
expensive
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
is
very
high
almost
10
yet
the
beer
retains
a
very
smooth
dark
taste
this
is
definitely
a
fuller
and
richer
porter
many
porters
ive
tried
recently
have
a
sort
of
watery
chocolate
taste
but
black
boss
has
a
wonderfully
deep
coffee
flavor
overall
im
now
a
fan
of
baltic
porters
this
one
at
least
is
a
porter
for
those
who
enjoy
sweet
stouts
my
first
beer
from
poland
and
a
solid
one
at
that
a
tiny
bit
too
sweet
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
hop
or
roasted
malt
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweet
dark
fruit
and
cherry
flavor
o
excellent
brew
not
a
fan
of
porters
so
much
but
i
do
enjoy
russian
imperial
stouts
on
occasion
this
is
closer
to
that
style
than
a
porter
in
my
opinion
and
i
will
continue
to
try
others
in
this
style
in
the
future
when
i
can
find
them
i
followed
a
brooklyn
winter
ale
with
this
the
striking
thing
was
that
they
were
nearly
identical
in
appearance
but
this
is
by
far
a
better
beer
the
style
may
be
unfamiliar
to
us
drinkers
who
have
a
very
different
notion
of
baltic
porter
and
there
is
at
least
one
polish
representative
of
the
latter
style
but
this
is
precisely
what
an
actual
porter
tastes
like
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
sea
from
the
oder
to
the
finnish
border
latvia
and
estonia
have
similar
heavy
sweet
porters
that
are
shockingly
their
common
summer
brew
as
i
said
you
have
to
recognize
it
for
what
it
isin
context
if
you
are
expecting
a
standard
baltic
porter
style
youll
be
disappointed
but
judging
on
its
own
merits
its
not
bad
worth
another
shot
or
two
which
is
more
than
i
said
about
brooklyn
winter
ale
nice
beer
available
at
bierkraft
in
brooklyn
for
less
than
3
very
dark
brown
decent
balance
and
well
masked
kick
make
for
a
nice
quaff
looks
like
this
will
be
regularly
on
the
shelf
bought
mine
in
wb
although
big
in
malty
flavor
sweetness
is
very
light
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
works
definitely
a
beer
i
could
get
drunk
on
since
it
has
a
high
alcohol
content
yet
is
not
very
filling
i
would
not
be
inclined
to
pair
this
with
very
many
food
options
a
nice
decent
porter
if
you
like
them
sweet
if
not
it
may
gross
you
out
especially
as
it
warms
sadly
in
the
mouth
its
immediately
too
sweet
dark
fruits
simple
syrup
toffee
and
wood
barrel
i
could
really
use
some
roasted
grain
or
hop
bitterness
to
balance
all
the
dried
fruits
how
about
some
unsweetened
cocoa
or
burnt
coffee
no
its
all
sweetness
im
getting
vanilla
now
too
plus
an
unwelcome
leather
wait
theres
the
roasted
malt
and
coffee
faintly
it
helps
put
the
sweetness
into
perspective
and
raises
the
score
a
bit
o
4
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
almost
taste
like
cinnamon
toast
crunch
but
with
more
dark
malty
roasted
notes
the
cool
thing
is
it
doesnt
really
compare
to
any
other
porter
or
stout
that
ive
had
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
completely
not
what
i
want
in
a
porter
even
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
this
is
likely
a
bit
much
o
2
73
for
a
pint
this
is
one
of
the
cheapest
pintssingle
servings
available
at
my
local
craft
beer
store
but
it
definitely
is
in
the
top
half
in
terms
of
taste
i
readily
admit
that
im
a
sucker
for
beers
that
successfully
pull
off
having
a
high
abv
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
porters
and
happens
to
see
this
in
a
local
store
picked
up
this
9

abv
500ml
bottle
on
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
who
happens
to
work
at
my
local
imported
beer
store
rarely
am
i
disappointed
with
his
recommendations
and
this
beer
fits
the
bill
previous
reviews
accentuate
the
estery
l
fruit
like
finish
which
is
no
doubt
present
in
this
porter
but
dont
allow
those
descriptions
to
scare
you
away
from
the
roasty
chocolate
backbone
of
this
outstanding
beer
perhaps
a
different
type
of
yeast
and
this
would
be
a
top
notch
imperial
stout
at
2
39
a
pint
everyone
should
take
a
shot
at
this
fantastic
polish
porter
o
black
boss
dark
fruit
esters
add
wonderful
layers
of
complexity
to
this
chocolaty
beer
as
suggestions
of
licorice
and
molasses
come
in
to
seal
the
deal
surprisingly
drinkable
smooth
and
deceptive
this
porter
makes
for
a
great
cold
weather
treat
taste
is
roasty
but
thin
with
lots
of
alcohol
and
a
metallic
twang
kind
of
nutty
but
with
a
twangy
bitterness
one
of
the
better
polish
brews
ive
tasted
not
much
else
to
say
however
pours
like
coke
or
pepsi
but
without
the
carbonation
smells
of
slightly
burnt
caramel
taste
is
a
tad
sweet
on
the
front
end
but
overall
very
good
and
a
satisfying
drink
not
a
lot
of
burn
considering
the
9

this

baltic
porter
is
a

good
beer
for

cost

an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with

foamy
dark

foamy
streaks

on

down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted

cocoa
powder
and
sugary
chocolate
syrup

taste
is
much
the
same
with
extremely
sweet
cocoa
powder
char
and
vegetal
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
fairly
tasty
when
cold
but
as
it
warms
up
there
is
an
acrid
burnt
vegetal
and
grain
flavor
that
is
pretty
offputting
a
dark
brown
almost
black
pour
with
2
fingers
of
creme
colored
head
slow
dissipation
and
nice
lacing
left
behind
there
is
a
heavy
booze
aroma
at
first
which
leads
to
sweet
raisin
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
a
very
easy
drinking
porter
sweet
up
front
with
raisin
and
chocolate
notes
then
a
nice
charred
roasted
bitterness
hits
you
and
leads
way
to
a
fig
flavor
that
leads
to
a
sweet
finish
for
the
amount
of
malt
needed
to
make
such
a
high
percentage
beer
im
surprised
at
how
thin
of
a
pour
this
is
medium
in
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
beer
go
down
nice
and
easy
this
bottle
is
a
few
years
old
and
has
developed
very
nicely
over
time
so
i
suggest
picking
up
a
few
since
theyre
cheapish
a
very
deep
brown
practically
just
a
shade
or
two
lighter
than
black
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
frothy
khaki
colored
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
and
laces
nicely
there
isnt
too
much
in
the
smell
i
do
get
just
a
touch
of
the
chocolate
and
caramel
that
youd
expect
in
a
porter
but
more
yeast
character
and
alcohol
than
is
normal
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
some
of
the
alcohol
flavors
carried
over
in
the
end
some
of
the
more
typical
porter
flavors
of
roast
malt
and
coffee
come
through
overall
the
bitterness
is
quite
low
or
perhaps
that
is
just
my
perception
which
could
be
skewed
by
the
near
cloying
sweetness
the
body
and
carbonation
level
are
both
in
the
middle
of
the
range
as
mentioned
previously
the
finish
is
a
touch
sweet
but
that
gives
way
to
a
drying
roasty
character
after
a
minute
or
two
overall
i
cant
get
by
the
sweetness
of
this
it
will
appeal
to
some
but
ive
just
never
been
a
big
fan
of
big
dark
beers
that
dont
bring
the
malt
flavors
that
their
color
suggests
id
compare
this
to
spaten
optimizer
an
imperial
stout
its
also
sweeter
and
more
palatable
to
me
than
obsidian
stout
and
packs
a
little
more
punch
than
black
butte
porter
and
its
sweetness
was
more
to
my
liking
i
found
it
at
a
great
price
in
a
grocery
store
and
will
definitely
try
it
again
o
an
odd
porter
with
an
unusual
aroma
and
some
unexpected
flavors
interesting
and
worth
trying
even
though
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
red
black
with
an
off
white
head
smells
of
raisins
and
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
of
raisins
and
coffee
very
nice
balanced
and
full
beer
is
full
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
very
nice
baltic
porter
overall
pretty
good
no
hint
of
the
the
higher
abv
pour
a
mild
cola
color
hardly
black
enough
to
be
called
a

paper
head
is

if
your
looking

to
get
your
block
rocked
you
could
do
alot
worse
a

forward
which
surprises
me
as
this
is
less
strong
than
zywiec
my
standard
goto
polish
baltic
porter
though
not
nearly
as
drinkable
still
a
bready
meal
in
a
glass
well
suited
to
a
night
cap
or
a
small
meal
of
sausage
cabbage
etc
very
tasty
light
feeling
but
that
is
what
makes
it
refreshing
very
drinkable
all
year
around
and
wow
with
the
beer
prices
today
this
is
the
best

for

this
is
not
a
bells
porter
but
its
not
5
a
bottle
eather
enjoy
oh
the
compaion
food
with
this
beverage
is
more
black
boss
porter
quite
a
solid
effort
here
black
cherry
in
color
maybe
a
little
darker
and
very
clear
with
a
little
carbonation
evident
decent
lacing
and
a
light
covering
that
remains
aroma
has
the
requisite
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
a
touch
of
coffee
an
english
style
fruitiness
with
raisins
and
mild
figs
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
mild
toffeecaramel
sweetness
taste
is
a
recapitulation
of
the
nose
chocolate
and
coffee
molasses
and
toffee
smooth
roasted
malt
and
lots
of
it
earthy
and
dry
hop
bitterness
that
finishes
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
lingering
grapefruit
some
light
graham
feel
is
surprisingly
light
for
a
beer
with
this
kind
of
og
velvety
carbonation
silky
swallow
a
great
example
and
a
wonderful
bargain
at
less
than
1
30
for
a
500ml
bottle
overall
this
was
interesting
enough
to
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
a
second
time
overall
i
could
see
why
i
picked
this
up
its
a
nice
change
from
a
chocolatechalky
taste
in
your
imperial
porter
i
love
the
fruity
chocolateroast
sweet
finish
aspect
this
beer
gets
worth
picking
up
just
to
try
polands
best
porter
o
the
mouthfeel
is
the
weak
point
of
this
beer
and
carbonation
is
the
main
issue
its
rather
flat
this
may
be
a
product
of
poor
bottlingrough
shipping
among
other
things
still
it
doesnt
detract
enough
from
the
drinking
experience
to
make
it
totally
unenjoyable
in
fact
this
is
a
pretty
decent
baltic
porter
and
more
traditional
than
some
examples
of
the
style
we
see
over
here
many
american
versions
including
some
of
my
favorites
admittedly
are
affected
by
that
overzealous
biggerisbetter
american
mentality
they
come
off
tasting
more
like
an
imperial
stout
than
a
true
baltic
porter
its
refreshing
to
drink
something
a
little
more
authentic
and
straight
from
the
source
this
is
a
real
brain
cell
assassin
at
9
4
abv
too
it
almost
feels
sessionable
and
if
it
wasnt
labeled
youd
never
know
it
possessed
that
strength
until
you
were
swinging
from
the
chandeliers
overall
odd
beer
has
a
bit
of
funky
wine
character
amidst
the
porter
flavor
drinkable
and
somewhat
enjoyable
something
i
might
consider
buying
again
though
its
not
necessarily
representative
of
the
baltic
style
poured
a
pitched
black
had
this
in
a
dimly
lighted
bar
mind
you
with
good
onefinger
tan
head
that
died
quick
but
left
some
lace
on
top
of
a
dry
roasted
aroma
with
a
mix
of
some
sweet
malt
smells
like
caramel
possibly
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
and
sticky
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
roasted
malts
and
finishes
nice
with
a
crisp
finish
abv
leads
to
heated
finish
but
doesnt
nuke
the
tastebuds
or
anything
good
not
great
porter
as
the
tastes
themselves
are
basic
but
pleasing
some
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
and
maybe
a
touch
of
candy
fruit
or
something
good
beer
worth
trying
not
the
greatest
but
thats
more
of
a
critique
than
an
indictment
pours
the
color
of
molasses
with
a
healthy
amount
of
mocha
foam
that
settles
to
an
appreciable
veil
that
remains
indefinitely
the
aroma
is
very
mild
a
faint
combination
of
molasses
and
cocoa
the
flavor
is
much
bolder
than
aroma
with
a
roasted
malt
character
headlined
by
dark
fruit
molasses
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
flavor
is
not
extreme
considering
the
abv
but
its
certainly
hard
to
miss
some
vanilla
also
manifests
itself
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
typical
of
the
baltic
porters
ive
tried
a
lush
roasty
fog
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
after
all
else
has
subsided
lending
a
really
nice
finish
on
the
down
side
the
flavor
profile
lacks
some
cohesion
with
heavy
handed
flavors
smacking
the
palate
variably
in
succession
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
baltic
porters
so
perhaps
im
being
a
bit
harsh
here
with
that
said
this
is
better
than
other
baltic
porters
ive
tried
so
it
appears
to
be
a
very
solid
offering
for
the
style
o
great
beer
for
the
value
otherwise
above
average
by
other
means
it
is
worth
the
2bottle
price
and
would
certainly
consider
purchasing
again
ive
had
better
porters
but
this
beer
is
better
than
many
others
ive
tried
before
would
recommend
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
push
it
on
someone
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
a
touch
strong
but
masked
rather
well
pours
darker
than
a
stout
or
your
typical
porter
about
3
of
thick
cream
topper
very
smooth
robust
taste
and
not
to
bitter
after
bite
i
sincerely
enjoyed
this
probably
would
have
tasted
even
better
with
a
fat
filet
mignon
or
tbone
overall
it
was
a
perfect
end
to
a
halloween
evening
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
recommenddrink
again
this
is
by
far
the
strongest
porter
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
and
it
certainly
didnt
disappoint
this
beer
had
a
very
strong
malt
taste
to
it
with
a
very
sweet
mouthfeel
i
will
have
to
do
a
more
thorough
tasting
but
at
2
a
bottle
i
will
certainly
be
purchasing
it
again
overall
always
willing
to
pick
up
something
knew
when
i
see
it
in
this
case
not
enjoying
it
much
maybe
close
to
old
world
porter
but
nothing
like
the
new
baltic
porters
o
interesting
polish
beer
i
might
not
seek
it
out
but
its
certainly
recommendable
hefty
and
drinkable
odmy
first
judgment
came
in
the
liquor
store
there
i
found
500
ml
of
9
4
abv
baltic
porter
for
1
60
that
deserves
an
a
for
value
and
the
beer
itself
is
unique
and
frankly
quite
tasty
i
could
get
a
nice
groove
going
with
about
3
of
these
for
under
6
bucks
to
boot
an
enjoyable
highgravity
cheap
beer
one
of
the
few
of
its
kind
rjt
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
baltic
porter
and
a
good
substitute
since
the
king
queen
of
baltic
porters
okocim
and
zywiek
are
so
difficult
to
find
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
smoothe
and
easy
drinking
if
i
didnt
already
know
i
would
be
astonished
that
it
is
9
4
abv
masked
very
well
would
be
good
around
christmas
with
gingerbread
houses
perhaps
i
would
also
be
curious
to
see
how
it
ages
might
have
to
pick
up
a
couple
when
i
am
home
again
overall
awesome
porter
wonderfully
balanced
and
complex
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
many
of
the
chocolateespresso
flavors
were
ok
but
the
over
the
top
alcohol
yes
9
is
too
much
and
kills
this
one
chasin
cheers
a
sweet
heavy
high
alcohol
content
porter
pretty
tasty
if
the
sweetness
doesnt
bother
you
also
cant
beat
the
price
of
this
porter
a
an
amazing
addition
to
a
large
hearty
meal
pairs
great
with
stews
bigos
in
particular
and
one
pot
meat
dishes
the
sweetness
may
turn
off
some
people
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
be
careful
of
the
high
alcohol
content
if
you
drink
it
from
a
mug
you
may
wake
up
in
a
revolutionary
war
graveyard
down
the
street
from
your
house
yes
i
did
the
price
is
one
of
the
many
selling
points
besides
its
ability
to
go
with
food
like
a
fine
wine
i
am
able
to
get
this
beer
in
the
11
2oz
bottles
for
35
a
case
an
amazing
feat
for
a
porter
that
is
9
4
if
you
can
find
the
16oz
bottles
even
better
pricevolume
dangerous
them
big
bottles
because
you
can
slam
them
like
its
milk
this
poured
out
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
it
had
a
dark
brown
color
that
faded
into
black
as
the
head
settled
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
of
some
lager
aromas
some
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
earthiness
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
slight
chocolate
note
in
the
beginning
that
fades
into
an
earthy
roasted
grain
flavor
with
the
lager
yeast
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
its
not
even
that
heavy
for
a
porter
overall
its
a
good
brew
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
good
on
most
levels
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
is
a
well
balanced
porter
slightly
on
the
sweeter
side
with
a
high
abv
that
is
not
very
detectible
pretty
good
and
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
low
price
o
a
porter
lovers
porter
everything
presented
here
is
dark
roasted
or
burnt
i
love
this
beer
this
now
wins
my
most
dangerous
beer
award
as
im
wondering
how
many
of
these
500
ml
bad
boys
i
could
put
away
in
an
evening
something
tells
me
i
better
not
try
to
find
out
o
good
porter
definitely
worth
the
price
of
2
something
for
500ml
almost
always
have
one
of
these
on
hand
overall
this
is
an
amazing
porter
i
am
partial
to
porters
but
also
quite
critical
not
too
sweet
not
too
smokey
just
the
right
balance
my
only
complaint
its
too
good
it
is
so
easy
going
down
that
you
forget
how
heavy
the
alcohol
is
drink
this
one
slowly
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
not
available
in
most
places
bought
this
as
a
cheap
filler
for
a
beer
tasting
under
2
for
16
oz
but
this
was
one
of
the
hits
of
the
party
decent
head
on
a
black
coffee
colored
beer
bursting
of
chocolate
and
some
coffee
undertones
alcohol
is
well
hidden
my
first
beer
from
poland
and
i
was
very
impressed
price
point
2
0916
9oz
bottle
o
weird
beer
not
your
usual
porter
not
sure
if
i
enjoy
it
or
not
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
stemmed
porter
glass
small
head
which
dissipated
quickly
with
some
lacing
poured
a
deep
dark
ruby
red
strong
smell
of
caramel
taste
a
sweet
coffeecaramel
flavor
with
hints
of
sorghum
one
of
the
sweetest
porters
ive
had
definitely
a
breakfast
or
dessert
beer
overall
very
nice
would
buy
more
porters
are
my
favorite
beer
style
i
prefer
them
over
stouts
because
theyre
generally
sweeter
this
particular
porter
is
sweeter
than
most
its
also
thinner
than
most
but
that
just
makes
it
all
the
more
drinkable
o
good
very
average
yet
the
high
alcohol
content
and
low
price
definitely
make
this
porter
worth
the
try
overall
it
is
good
but
not
amazing
i
would
try
it
again
but
not
go
crazy
to
get
my
hands
on
it
true
to
the
style
of
sour
tangy
and
smokey
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
arent
all
baltic
porters
lighter
body
than
i
expected
black
boss
porter
is
one
of
the
most
notable
surprise
beers
i
have
come
across
in
a
long
while
furthermore
it
paired
perfectly
with
my
kielbasa
and
pierogi
dinner
do
yourself
a
favor
by
going
to
your
local
polish
market
and
buying
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
you
will
thank
me
later
breakfast
beer
lots
of
residual
sugars
but
still
light
not
nearly
as
big
or
dark
as
other
baltics
very
drinkable
usually
baltic
porters
are
just
too
sweet
or
bitter
without
hops
or
just
not
right
for
me
this
one
was
decent
at
a
decent
price
so
id
check
it
out
again
anytime
there
is
a
strong
drink
that
doesnt
suck
at
a
cheap
price
it
has
a
place
in
the
world
deservedly
o
rather
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
feel
it
is
well
brewed
for
a
porter
and
plan
on
continuing
to
buy
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
love
to
have
more
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
as
weak
as
the
nose
thin
and
watery
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
on
advice
from
my
brother
i
gave
one
of
these
a
try
over
the
holidays
very
dark
with
some
hint
of
ruby
almost
no
aroma
apart
from
maybe
some
hints
of
coffee
maybe
should
have
served
it
warmer
malty
sweet
chocolatey
with
hints
of
spice
and
a
burnt
edge
to
it
really
no
hop
flavor
or
detectable
alcohol
which
was
unexpected
im
not
a
huge
porter
fan
but
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
very
good
d
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
bit
boozy
as
it
warmed
taste
fairly
sweet
with
lots
of
dark
malts
and
the
molasses
again
is
the
dominant
feature
fairly
drinkable
although
the
body
is
lacking
especially
for
a
porter
overall
pretty
good
if
you
see
it
grab
it
and
give
it
a
go
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
level
cheers
to
all
and
hope
you
enjoy
o
this
is
just
a
poorly
made
hard
to
drink
beer
not
a
good
effort
one
of
the
best
of
the
baltics
poured
this
one
at
a
good
temperature
and
with
a
nice
sized
thick
foamy
tan
head
that
settled
down
after
a
bit
and
some
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
but
clear
brown
red
aroma
is
roast
malt
cocoa
hints
of
licorice
and
molasses
flavors
very
similar
to
nose
with
slight
sweetness
up
front
a
little
tang
from
carbonics
and
bitterness
from
malts
yeast
excellent
full
mouth
and
perfect
carbonation
finsih
is
like
flavor
no
off
notes
and
fairly
long
and
slight
alcohol
warming
great
porter
beer
overall
its
a
nice
beer
it
cost
less
than
2
which
is
a
crazy
bargain
considering
how
good
it
is
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
id
enjoy
that
one
sampled
on
november
19
2011
from
the
500
ml
bottle
it
pours
dark
brown
with
better
clarity
than
the
average
porter
some
head
the
aroma
is
an
odd
cross
between
dark
malts
and
toffee
kind
of
cardboard
like
too
the
body
is
medium
to
bold
the
taste
is
not
smoky
or
chocolatelike
but
it
most
definitely
has
a
weird
kind
of
astringency
which
leads
to
a
slight
hop
bite
but
that
is
more
like
the
traditional
baltic
style
it
is
not
my
kind
of
porter
because
i
like
the
smoke
but
since
they
began
brewing
it
in
1848
maybe
this
is
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
be
this
would
be
decent
if
the
body
was
bigger
and
the
nose
wasnt
so
offputting
for
the
price
and
abv
not
a
bad
offering
overy
well
rounded
and
complex
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
o
i
was
happy
to
drink
this
but
i
wish
it
had
just
a
bit
more
body
otherwise
its
pretty
good
o
not
a
bad
a
beer
easy
to
drink
maybe
too
easy
would
drink
again
perhaps
a
bit
of
aging
but
right
now
ridiculously
hot
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
enjoyable
porter
my
first
polish
beer
and
hopefully
not
my
last
omay
buy
this
one
again
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
am
aging
for
a
year
to
compare
this
one
against
ive
yet
to
taste
a
polish
baltic
porter
that
i
didnt
like
the
same
is
true
with
black
boss
exact
same
color
as
coca
cola
light
beige
creamy
head
that
clung
somewhat
smells
toasty
and
caramel
sweet
taste
is
very
sweet
caramel
and
roasty
chocolate
a
bit
more
sweet
than
i
prefer
the
roastiness
balances
the
sweetness
somewhat
and
takes
the
edge
off
of
the
9
4
alcohol
alcohol
is
a
little
deceptive
with
only
the
lightest
throat
warmth
surprised
by
the
thinness
of
the
mouth
feel
which
also
adds
to
the
deceptive
drinkability
i
have
had
better
polish
baltic
porters
but
this
one
is
not
bad
at
all
o
another
great
baltic
porter
but
not
my
favorite
much
prefer
the
viscosity
of
olfrabrikken
or
baltika
6
this
one
also
really
pushes
the
molasses
flavor
a
bit
too
much
3
5
slightly
metallic
but
very
roasty
with
creamy
carob
and
chocolate
flavors
as
it
warms
the
chocolate
flavors
become
more
front
and
center
ashy
roast
blends
with
mellow
sweetness
of
dark
chocolate
definitely
a
lager
with
roasted
malt
but
still
pretty
enjoyable
somehow
nice
char
and
chocolate
aftertaste
mf
nice
full
creamy
and
silky
body
on
this
one
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
flavors
that
do
stick
around
for
a
while
o
i
could
drink
this
porter
morning
and
night
great
breakfast
beer
creamy
smooth

everything
a
porter
should
be
and
at
9

youd
never
know
no
hit
of
strong
alcohol
at
all

pp

50
for
a
500ml
sign
me
up
i
want
more
more
more
overall
a
definite
must
have
again
though
i
will
choose
a
more
time
appropriate
season
as
the
sweltering
heat
descends
upon
this
north
carolina
summer
a
porter
with
this
much
flavor
is
not
what
i
have
in
mind
come
september
this
one
will
be
back
in
my
fridge
od
for
the
abv
it
does
well
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
its
a
little
high
for
another
and
the
sweetness
might
get
to
you
but
otherwise
tasty
i
intend
on
buying
this
again
o
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
one
drinkability
is
great
for
the
abv
and
it
keeps
me
interested
the
whole
way
through
will
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
i
first
had
this
beer
with
a
specialty
mushroom
and
cumin
flavored
pizza
and
now
i
am
convinced
that
any
low
ratings
are
the
result
of
trying
to
drink
this
without
the
proper
food
for
me
this
beer
has
a
slightly
sweet
note
and
operates
like
comfort
food
in
the
best
way
its
like
licking
the
inside
of
a
fireplace
after
a
holiday
season
and
it
compliments
the
natural
smoke
of
cumin
like
a
strong
but
smooth
cigar
after
a
chargrilled
sirloin
after
having
two
or
three
of
these
growlers
on
different
occasions
of
course
this
is
a
high
alcohol
beer
i
noticed
that
its
better
in
the
first
ten
minutes
after
opening
after
that
it
loses
its
already
low
carbonation
and
goes
a
bit
flat
that
flat
watery
mouthfeel
deadens
an
otherwise
fantastic
beer
that
should
be
reserved
for
comfort
during
a
night
alone
or
thinking
about
your
next
big
move
in
life
overall
a
very
nice
porter
and
very
drinkable
and
smooth
you
wont
be
dissapointed
as
they
say
in
poland
bardzo
ładne
piwa
cieszyć
się
all
in
all
at
2
50
a
bottle
black
boss
represents
excellent
value
for
an
imported
dark
ale
call
it
porter
call
it
a
stout
whatever
but
if
you
spot
it
somewhere
grab
it
you
wont
be
sorry
overall
if
you
like
stoutsporters
that
are
not
too
sweet
almost
dry
and
not
too
heavy
like
it
doesnt
have
to
feel
like
a
meal
and
you
see
one
of
these
on
a
shelf
grab
it
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
possibly
my
new
favorite
porter
it
has
a
wonderful
taste
is
easy
to
drink
and
at
around
5
00
a
bottle
a
great
value
for
such
an
amazing
beer
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
black
only
when
held
up
to
a
light
do
i
see
a
tiny
bit
of
brown
at
the
base
of
the
glass
this
is
motor
oil
here
folks
very
little
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
of
chocolate
coffee
beans
walnuts
cherries
and
booze
mouthfeel
is
actually
light
taste
is
of
chocolate
coffee
beans
walnuts
cherries
and
booze
this
is
a
super
cheap
beer
well
worth
the
quality
and
amount
you
get
great
deal
great
find
drank
one
of
these
with
my
good
ba
buddy
y2korey
as
we
tossed
backed
some
tater
tots
good
light
bodied
baltic
porter
with
a
deep
brownish
amber
hue
beautiful
brown
sugar
and
caramel
nose
this
beer
tastes
like
a
brew
version
of
a
port
wine
i
love
some
good
ports
too
nice
mouthfeel
and
lingering
finish
black
boss
porter
drinks
easy
for
having
an
abv
of
9
40
this
is
really
not
my
kind
of
porter
the
abv
is
hidden
very
very
well
but
it
lacks
the
characteristics
i
like
in
a
porter
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
pretty
tasty
id
buy
it
again
honestly
surprised
by
this
beer
my
moms
boyfriend
brought
this
over
when
he
was
visiting
and
i
have
to
say
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
it
i
see
it
all
over
the
place
and
expected
it
to
be
kind
of
disappointing
like
sheaf
stout
however
it
is
quite
good
and
worth
a
try
reminds
me
of
sam
smiths
oatmeal
in
a
way
the
abv
will
surprise
you
on
this
one
definitely
feels
like
7
not
9
a
lovely
baltic
porter
nothing
world
changing
but
a
benchmark
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
you
cant
tell
its
9
4
its
very
smooth
black
color
with
tan
head
that
retains
pretty
well
chocolatecoffee
bitterness
good
full
body
and
mouthfeel
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
like
dark
beers
or
porters
not
surper
hoppy
more
malt
flovors
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
drinkability
very
decenttasting
brew
and
at
9
4
abv
in
one
pint
not
a
bad
kick
for
the
price
d
decent
drinkability
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
nice
porter
but
was
not
a
big
beer
even
for
the
high
alcohol
content
drinkability
nice
beer
not
blow
your
mind
but
great
beer
up
their
with
all
the
others
i
have
in
style
drinkability
was
very
good
especially
for
such
a
strong
beer
not
too
heavy
or
filling
this
beer
can
potentially
become
dangerous
good
flavors
and
reasonably
priced
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
conclusion
this
is
my
second
polish
baltic
porter
and
it
is
different
from
the
other
i
have
tried
both
were
very
good
the
other
zywiec
was
better
overall
but
this
is
still
a
well
crafted
porter
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
or
drink
it
again
the
flavor
is
more
singular
in
this
offering
and
in
a
way
the
simplicity
is
very
enjoyable
well
done
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
black
and
chocolate
malt
scent
its
bitter
and
roasted
with
a
good
deal
of
chocolate
malt
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
the
taste
is
good
it
has
an
incredibly
smooth
malt
flavor
thats
quite
sweet
with
some
roasted
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
it
seems
to
hide
the
alcohol
well
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
definitely
a
good
value
at
just
over
2
00
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
somewhat
rich
without
being
overdone
16
9oz
bottle
pours
a
thin
black
color
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
boozey
aromas
of
honey
molasses
and
malts
the
flavor
is
a
dark
sweetness
molasses
and
honey
not
as
boozey
as
the
smell
would
indicate
but
you
can
taste
some
of
the
alcohol
this
is
one
hell
of
a
deal
i
picked
up
this
brew
for
about
2
its
9
4
abv
and
has
a
solid
taste
surprising
amount
of
drinkability
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
perfect
beer
to
have
a
few
of
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
very
strange
one
first
thing
i
noticed
as
i
poured
this
beer
was
a
black
opaqueness
that
looked
very
inviting
very
little
head
and
it
dissipated
immediately
i
had
a
hard
time
distinguishing
anything
other
scent
than
merlot
yep
this
beer
smelled
exactly
like
merlot
to
me
i
barely
pick
up
a
little
raisin
it
it
taste
was
were
i
lost
some
enthusiasm
i
found
this
beer
to
really
have
no
body
to
it
low
carbonation
and
not
much
taste
at
all
pretty
disappointing
i
dont
understand
how
a
so
called
baltic
porter
could
have
no
backbone
to
it
drinkability
i
found
to
be
quite
high
the
9
4abv
was
hidden
quite
well
this
is
a
big
beer
pours
out
pitch
black
with
a
faint
red
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
huge
fluffy
tan
head
that
simmers
down
fairly
quick
then
patiently
sits
around
for
a
while
reeks
of
alcohol
has
a
fermented
brown
sugar
aroma
and
a
strong
scent
of
bakers
chocolate
and
overripe
plums
the
alcohol
is
up
front
in
the
taste
and
dominates
the
beer
while
the
sweetness
of
this
one
is
almost
too
much
to
handle
it
leaves
a
sweet
aftertaste
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
after
each
sip
not
too
pleasant
though
slight
bitterness
going
on
as
well
not
much
else
really
happening
in
this
one
the
sugars
and
alcohol
cover
up
the
malts
leaving
a
fairly
light
feeling
beer
and
the
carbonation
in
this
bottle
is
raging
not
what
i
expected
for
this
baltic
porter
and
i
likely
wont
be
seeking
this
one
again
dthis
is
very
drinkable
at
9
4
abv
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
in
the
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
and
would
satisfy
all
kinds
of
dark
beers
lovers
one
bottle
is
plenty
because
of
its
over
the
top
molasses
character
and
abv
i
think
it
is
quite
yummy
actually
i
have
to
say
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
it
drank
very
well
for
9
4abv
had
some
nice
roasty
malts
and
other
dark
malts
slight
syrupy
flavors
with
caramel
and
some
roasty
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
tasty
just
a
slight
extract
syrup
flavor
d
easy
drinking
and
not
what
i
expected
at
all
not
picking
up
the
9
4
at
all
either
if
i
had
to
guess
id
put
this
at
around
4
5
interesting
brew
and
worth
trying
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
this
out
again
if
you
want
to
tick
poland
however
i
dont
think
you
could
go
wrong
with
this
brew
d
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
considering
the
price
style
abv
and
even
the
label
design
which
i
love
one
finger
light
tan
head
medium
dissipation
with
some
lacing
dark
brown
clear
body
no
visible
carbonation
pretty
nondescript
nose
i
had
a
hard
time
picking
up
my
aroma
other
than
a
bit
of
floral
hop
presence
taste
is
pretty
sweet
for
the
style
caramel
malts
minor
floral
hop
presence
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
sticky
drinkability
isnt
real
high
quite
boozy
but
given
the
abv
pretty
good
not
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
but
certainly
one
of
the
most
authentic
a
strong
addition
to
the
somewhat
surprisingly
powerful
lineup
of
polish
baltics
a
little
more
raw
and
unrefined
than
okocim
but
creamier
than
zywiec
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
very
minimal
hues
of
deep
red
the
head
is
foamy
tan
with
fair
retention
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
with
a
slight
boozy
and
astringent
backing
a
mix
of
sweet
molasses
and
roasted
malts
with
very
astringent
bitterness
and
hint
of
sourness
with
some
licorice
notes
it
is
all
a
bit
over
whelming
though
as
it
is
quite
the
mix
of
very
strong
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
to
full
body
with
pleasant
yet
subtle
carbonation
as
it
warms
it
does
mellow
out
a
bit
and
become
more
drinkable
i
didnt
expect
too
much
from
this
and
almost
spit
it
out
after
the
initial
molasses
kick
but
im
glad
i
didnt
still
a
little
thin
and
sticky
for
my
taste
but
an
excellent
end
to
the
night
its
been
a
great
stomach
settler
for
sipping
on
and
entering
the
days
reviews
lightly
carbonated
good
smooth
porter
i
like
and
could
drink
more
drinkability
really
enjoyable
one
of
my
new
favorites
in
the
style
the
taste
is
sweet
without
being
cloying
i
will
search
for
this
again
d
definitely
worth
a
try
i
found
it
enjoyable
dat
the
price
point
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
notice
that
its
similar
to
helivus
kaper
im
going
to
go
with
no
thank
you
a
good
friend
recommended
this
brew
but
i
have
to
say
this
is
not
one
to
offer
to
a
pal
d
an
incredible
beer
that
has
one
of
the
smoothest
feels
in
recent
memory
great
sweet
and
roasty
porter
flavor
with
that
signature
european
yeast
strain
taste
to
pull
it
all
together
a
solid
beer
all
around
and
one
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
a
nice
beer
i
might
have
been
a
victim
of
the
overhype
but
wasnt
necessarily
let
down
either
i
would
go
back
for
another
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
search
it
out
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
but
i
am
left
wanting
something
more
from
it
everyone
kept
tellng
me
to
try
this
porter
and
when
i
finally
did
i
was
just
a
little
disappointed
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
good
it
just
wasnt
as
great
as
people
led
me
to
believe
plus
it
takes
a
lot
to
get
me
jazzed
up
on
a
porter
one
thing
i
did
really
enjoy
about
this
porter
was
that
for
being
9
4
abv
you
are
not
left
tasting
the
alcohol
like
some
high
alcohol
brews
pours
a
dark
brown
color
body
somewhat
see
thru
held
up
to
the
light
some
small
dark
tan
colored
head
dark
almost
dirt
smell
heavy
roasted
flavors
strong
grape
aroma
too
purple
grape
juice
some
alcohol
not
too
heavy
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
odd
flavor
a
little
better
as
it
warms
d
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
from
a
polish
beer
but
this
one
was
pleasantly
surprising
a
big
beer
with
good
flavor
and
well
masked
alcohol
presence
i
now
know
better
than
to
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
pours
a
deep
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
finger
of
ecru
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
oats
and
dark
malts
with
cameo
appearances
from
cocoa
and
coffee
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
host
of
roast
followed
by
a
darkly
wheaty
flavor
and
finished
by
a
powdery
cocoa
flavor
the
body
is
surprisingly
light
considering
the
wheaty
and
oaty
characteristics
which
despite
the
relatively
high
alcohol
helps
keep
the
drinkability
fairly
high
skål
i
have
reviewed
this
beer
before
when
i
had
it
out
of
a
500ml
bomber
but
i
tried
black
boss
porter
out
of
two
different
types
of
growlers
one
was
a
a
short
fat
bottle
and
had
no
handles
the
other
was
elongated
and
had
a
stem
handle
at
the
top
the
second
one
was
referred
to
as
a
pyramid
growler
this
beer
is
phenomenal
500ml
brown
bottle
no
freshness
indication
to
be
found
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
more
than
a
finger
of
tanned
head
pretty
good
retension
and
a
nice
amount
of
lace
hanging
to
the
glass
nose
is
roasty
including
aromas
of
smoke
burnt
grain
and
hops
it
has
some
characteristics
in
the
nose
reminding
me
of
a
rauchbier
with
a
zip
of
citrus
thrown
into
the
tail
end
of
the
smell
blended
with
a
bit
of
yeast
taste
follows
suit
with
the
roasted
character
and
a
bit
of
residual
smokiness
left
in
the
mouth
9

abv
honestly
you
could
not
tell
it
has
this
much
alcohol
it
is
well
hidden
except
for
in
the
finish
flavor
also
includes
some
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
and
it
is
quite
woodsy
fairly
light
feel
with
this
beer
and
mild
carbination
rather
enjoyable
overall
if
you
are
into
woodsy
flavored
dark
beers
appearance
has
a
dark
rich
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
slowly
dissipates
with
fair
head
smell
has
a
big
hit
of
sweet
molasses
and
brown
sugar
standing
out
above
all
taste
again
has
molasses
brown
sugar
light
roasted
malt
thats
rich
with
light
hop
and
low
alchohol
taste
considering
mouthfeel
is
full
with
low
carbonation
making
it
go
down
smooth
makes
me
want
to
try
more
of
these
baltic
porters
overall
i
really
enjoyed
black
boss
and
will
drink
it
again
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
and
hope
to
try
others
of
the
style
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
well
which
is
no
simple
feat
considering
that
its
9
4
as
such
it
goes
down
surprisingly
easily
however
given
that
this
beer
has
only
one
real
flavor
and
its
incredibly
sweet
id
be
fine
with
only
drinking
one
drinkability
will
have
again
but
this
is
a
onenight
stand
for
sure
the
9
4
abv
just
lurks
around
and
knocks
you
around
a
little
bit
at
the
end
solid
porter
but
be
careful
d
enjoyable
overall
the
dark
fruits
and
sweetness
was
unique
and
more
of
a
mix
between
a
barleywine
and
a
stout
as
opposed
to
a
porter
drinkability
for
9
4
abv
this
is
a
deceptively
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
would
have
again
and
this
is
something
i
could
easily
do
given
its
low
price
tag
always
a
plus
overall
an
impressive
beer
and
one
that
seems
like
a
steal
in
todays
beer
marketplace
less
than
3
for
a
big
beer
from
poland
youve
got
to
be
kidding
d
as
my
second
porter
from
poland
i
have
to
say
this
one
is
better
than
the
grand
cru
this
seemed
to
be
less
sweet
with
the
alc
hidden
better
definitely
a
good
value
and
a
steal
at
the
price
point
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
rounded
flavor
not
so
much
of
a
session
beer
but
i
could
have
maybe
a
couple
a
night
but
overall
a
nice
brew
500
ml
a
black

somewhat
transluscent

some

minimal

some

and
some

with

follows

more
sweetness
than
some
baltics
chocolate
caramel
some
vanilla
and

not
a
ton
of
roast
in
this
but
a
little
chocolate
caramel
finishing
solid
medium
body
and
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
especially
as
it
warmed
borders
on
too
sweet
for
the
style
but
still
quite
drinkable
went
down
easy
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
offered
again
another
or
at
least
the
2nd
good
polish

ive
had
cheers
black
boss
is
a
dark
baltic
porter
with
heavy
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
even
molasses
it
pours
easy
with
its
little
carbonation
a
packs
a
aroma
that
the
misses
would
love
to
have
a
candle
of
the
smell
for
me
is
the
most
powerful
aspect
the
feel
is
light
but
creamy
and
really
doesnt
finish
as
bitter
as
you
would
expect
with
its
high
alcohol
content
its
real
sweet
at
is
a
great
dessert
beer
pairing
well
with
chocolate
of
course
a
also
find
this
to
pair
well
with
a
good
tobacco
as
i
smoke
a
briar
pipe
the
taste
it
leaves
you
with
makes
you
beg
for
that
next
drink
baltic
porter
is
probably
my
favorite
dark
variety
and
when
i
can
find
a
good
one
i
grab
iti
was
thinking
this
would
fit
the
bill
but
honestly
it
wasnt
poured
a
deep
cola
color
with
a
nice
creamy
lighter
mocha
colore
headthe
aromas
were
very
light
for
the
stylemainly
i
picked
up
hints
of
molasses
and
sweet
alcohol
body
seemed
really
thin
to
me
almost
wateryflavors
were
mild
with
some
mollases
and
brown
sugar
standing
out
mosta
mild
alcohol
infused
dark
fruit
element
comes
through
as
it
warms
as
well
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
kinda
fell
flat
we
originally
bought
this
because
it
is
from
poland
and
my
wife
is
polish
it
surprized
us
by
being
a
very
good
beer
it
is
very
dark
with
a
light
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
flavors
are
so
strong
and
well
balanced
that
the
beer
is
quite
good
it
has
almost
no
hop
flavor
or
aroma
just
coffee
lots
of
chocolate
and
dark
malt
very
drinkable
d
this
was
a
solid
baltic
porter
but
there
are
so
many
that
are
better
its
hard
not
to
beat
this
thing
up
in
fairness
it
tasted
good
and
was
not
hard
to
drink
so
i
guess
that
equated
to
good
drinkability
i
just
wish
the
brewers
would
clean
up
the
finish
a
bit
and
tone
down
the
fusel
alcohols
drinkability
lots
of
flavor
and
alcohol
detract
from
this
being
more
than
a
one
in
a
session
brew
this
beer
isnt
perfect
especially
in
the
nose
but
its
flavor
and
sheer
drinkability
have
made
this
one
of
my
favorite
dark
beers
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
good
drinkability
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
in
this
porter
at
this
price
and
quality
it
might
be
one
of
my
goto
sweet
baltic
porters
tasty
overall
well
worth
the
price
great
baltic
porter
would
definately
drink
again
honestly
i
am
suprised
so
many
people
like
it
but
to
each
his
own
dark
black
which
should
be
no
surprise
the
first
smell
is
liek
count
chocula
cereal
i
love
it
robust
chocoalte
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
porter
and
so
easy
to
drink
this
beer
was
only
2
69
for
a
500ml
bottle
and
i
feel
like
it
was
a
complete
steal
fantastic
porter
from
poland
d
the
high
abv
in
this
makes
it
a
one
bottle
thing
for
me
im
a
very
skinny
person
and
i
felt
a
decent
buzz
off
of
it
so
more
than
one
may
get
me
pretty
tipsy
but
still
an
amazing
beer
get
one
this
the
best
porter
that
ive
had
to
date
and
currently
my
favorite
beer
i
picked
it
up
at
the
package
store
for
1
84
for
the
pint
and
was
completely
blown
away
i
was
really
sad
that
i
only
got
one
cant
wait
to
get
another
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
a
mere
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
fragrant
graham
crackers
milk
chocolate
roasted
and
burnt
malt
it
is
a
very
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
is
just
as
big
as
the
aroma
there
is
just
as
much
chocolate
and
graham
cracker
and
more
roasted
malt
there
is
a
nice
moderate
bitterness
which
i
suspect
is
coming
from
the
roasted
malt
the
aftertaste
is
of
nice
lingering
milk
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
nearly
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
surprise
it
might
not
be
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
tasted
but
it
is
good
and
easily
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
pours
a
dense
black
that
has
some
slight
deep
copper
edging
with
a
light
cocoa
colored
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
nice
layer
atop
the
glass
the
aroma
has
mostly
sweet
chocolate
and
is
accompanied
by
some
roasted
malts
the
flavor
has
more
roasted
malts
a
lot
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
very
light
bitterness
its
a
very
light
bodied
porter
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
watery
porter
that
leaves
you
needing
much
more
flavor
and
the
aroma
is
a
dominated
by
too
much
chocolate
its
probably
not
the
best
baltic
porter
in
the
world
but
its
damn
good
and
a
steal
of
a
deal
at
the
price
i
paid
nasdrovia
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
scent
is
interesting
malty
maybe
some
licorice
taste
is
quite
complex
a
lot
of
smoky
flavor
but
elements
of
raisinlike
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
hidden
remarkably
well
goes
down
very
easily
maybe
a
little
smoky
for
my
taste
but
a
nice
offering
overall
drinkability
very
good
a
really
nice
baltic
porter
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
handed
now
ill
bet
this
ages
wonderfully
for
the
value
price
theres
no
reason
not
to
stock
up
on
a
few
and
find
out
this
is
one
incredible
beer
for
1
99
you
get
0
5
l
of
heaven
thats
9
4
abv
the
wonderful
thing
is
that
you
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
i
really
cant
say
enough
about
the
flavor
the
smokey
sweetness
is
quite
unique
the
closest
thing
i
can
compare
it
to
is
some
sort
of
wonderful
root
beer
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
you
must
do
so
as
soon
as
possible
at
this
price
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
value
md
thick
rich
a
meal
in
a
bottle
the
high
abv
isnt
readily
perceived
but
the
rest
of
it
is
amazingly
heavy
these
are
not
to
be
drunk
quickly
but
theyre
well
worth
it
and
being
readily
available
in
most
bodegas
by
me
at
1
502
per

a
great
value
im
gonna

is

this
stuff
tastes
like
its
aged
flavor
intermingle
edges
are
smoothed
out
and
that
all
adds
up
to
an
intriguing
and
interesting
offering
go
find
some
of
this
one
and
enjoy
its
intricacies
would
love
to
try
this
on
nitro
and
cask
or
just
tap
would
be
fine
lastly
the
abv
is
7
according
to
the
label
i
would
really
have
liked
to
try
it
at
94
since
i
think
higher
abv
would
have
served
it
well
heavy
creamy
body
slides
down
the
throat
and
smothers
the
palate
balanced
carbonation
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
make
it
incredibly
drinkable
it
took
me
a
moment
to
accept
the
heavy
teriyaki
aromas
but
once
i
realized
how
balanced
and
strong
this
porter
was
i
fell
in
love
definitely
a
beer
i
will
be
talking
about
for
a
while
quite
bubbly
for
looking
like
it
had
no
effervescence
in
there
and
at
9
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
d
really
good
great
example
of
a
baltic
porter
a
great
brew
at
a
great
price
really
glad
i
can
find
this
locally
notes
from
040706
this
is
one
big
outstanding
robust
porter
black
boss
is
a
great
porter
for
all
us
diehard
porter
fans
worldwide
very
highly
recommended
by
perfesser
homer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
black
but
when
held
to
the
light
shows
a
deep
reddish
color
the
head
is
a
wonderful
cream
mocha
color
that
last
quite
well
the
aroma
is
full
of
a
fantastic
mouth
watering
espresso
and
chocolate
tone
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
the
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
strong
but
a
slight
nuttiness
balances
the
brew
and
there
is
even
a
mild
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
but
that
is
certainly
tolerable
and
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
this
is
a
great
brew
i
have
to
thank
my
wife
for
picking
it
up
while
we
were
out
of
town
at
a
wedding
great
choice
d
it
is
very
drinkable
smooth
and
not
to
heavy
higher
alcohol
content
can
be
felt
half
way
through
i
have
not
had
too
many
brews
like
this
however
i
would
never
drink
more
than
one
but
worth
the
try
if
i
didnt
look
it
up
here
i
wouldnt
have
known
that
the
abv
was
clocking
in
at
9
4
this
is
scary
drinkable
mainly
due
to
the
thin
body
careful
this
guy
could
hurt
you
in
later
rounds
this
porter
is
an
amazing
quality
bang
for
the
buck
this
is
a
great
tasting
porter
with
an
alcohol
content
of
a
stout
this
is
a
super
rich
saturated
porter
with
hella
flavor
of
coffee
chocolate
and
well
hops
barley
this
porter
is
a
bit
chewy
as
far
as
porters
go
but
its
still
a
good
bet
if
you
can
only
grab
one
bottle
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
baltic
porter
but
i
just
wish
the
finish
was
a
little
longer
lasting
other
than
that
i
truly
enjoyed
this
offering
and
will
seek
it
out
again
zum
wohl
d
yeah
the
best
baltic
porter
i
have
ever
had
this
brew
is
just
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
9
4
abv
porter
its
been
sitting
in
my
beerpantry
for
about
a
year
and
it
has
improved
quite
a
bit
it
feels
alot
smoother
now
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
evening
recommended
this
porter
pours
near
black
and
has
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
has
a
mixture
of
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
some
dry
malt
a
big
malty
flavor
profile
as
well
great
balance
between
a
variety
of
rich
and
sweet
flavors
creamy
body
flows
over
palate
could
drink
this
9

beer
all
night
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at

with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
moderate
to
minimal
carbonation
i
didnt
expect
much
when
i
picked
this
beer
up
sort
of
expected
it
to
be
very
similar
to
the
baltika
porterbut
this
is
actually
a
really
nice
very
drinkable
beer
abv
is
very
well
hidden
id
pick
this
up
again
especially
at
this
price
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
reddish
hues
and
a
one
finger
brown
creamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
this
smells
like
a
port
wine
raisins
oak
sweet
cherry
big
flavors
of
raisins
and
caramel
up
front
with
a
bitter
chocolate
hoppy
finish
light
carbonation
heavy
body
this
beer
has
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
surprisingly
easy
drinking
for
9
4
abv
you
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
dominate
and
for
1
49
price
tag
a
bargain
worth
enjoying
taste
is
very
strong
on
the
chocolate
the
dark
heavy
baking
chocolate
type
together
with
the
cinnamon
notes
and
roasted
malt
a
great
combination
bitterness
is
medium
mouthfeel
is
rather
sweet
and
goes
with
the
style
aftertaste
is
a
long
dry
and
sticky
one
as
the
name
indicates
this
beer
poured
a
nice
thick
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
there
was
chocolate
alcohol
and
maybe
some
sour
cherries
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
breadiness
as
is
breathed
a
bit
the
flavor
had
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
slight
creaminess
the
malt
body
balanced
the
alcohol
it
finished
smooth
this
was
a
great
beer
for
the
price
2
80
for
500ml
bottle
and
a
good
beer
regardless
of
price
as
with
most
thick
beers
1
is
more
than
enough
deep
black
in
color
w
crimson
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
slight
head
smell
is
different
slightly
smoky
with
touch
of
leather
is
about
all
i
can
muster
flavor
has
a
mild
chocolate
tinge
coupled
with
smoke
and
toasted
grain
overall
not
too
bad
slightly
slick
watery
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
modest
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
considering
abv
drinkability
a
baltic
porter
the
way
it
should
be
dark
heavy
and
rough
hence
black
boss
is
probably
not
suited
for
comsumtpion
in
any
larger
amount
of
quantities
at
once
however
still
highly
recommended
this
is
a
great
porter
for
malt
fans
everywhere
overall
not
bad
at
all
i
was
not
really
sure
how
this
was
going
to
be
but
i
was
really
quite
pleasantly
suprised
this
was
definitly
a
solid
offering
and
cheep
like
2
99
if
you
see
it
make
a
nice
night
cap
and
a
good
call
d
overall
a
decent
example
of
a
highalchohol
porter
pours
an
black
color
with
a
tall
thick
tan
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
it
smells
of
deep
roasted
malts
and
some
hints
of
sweet
flavors
the
taste
is
good
for
a
porter
it
has
a
nice
very
deep
roasted
malt
backbone
that
has
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
some
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
very
smooth
and
a
little
crisp
at
the
end
which
is
nice
because
that
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
hardly
detected
the
drinkability
is
good
but
due
to
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
it
is
not
as
drinkable
as
some
others
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
kinda
low
definitely
a
good
one
to
try
but
a
tough
one
to
have
more
than
one
overall
a
very
unique
brew
one
of
the
more
interesting
i
have
tasted
from
eastern
europe
black

is
better
than
okocim
porter
and
at

for
500ml
probably
the
best
deal
going
at
my
local
booze
shop
highly
recommended
this

polish
beers
ive
had
black
boss
gots
balls
pours
jet
black
and
slightly
viscous
with
a
vanishingly
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
coffeeish
but
almost
entirely
dominated
by
earthy
and
malty
characters
flavor
is
similar
malty
as
hell
and
tasting
like
dirt
but
in
a
good
way
the
finish
is
unmistakable
black
patent
even
keeping
the
style
in
mind
just
a
little
more
hops
would
have
mad
this
beer
less
raw
but
its
very
good
and
certainly
far
better
than
i
had
expected
from
a
polish
beer
tasting
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
and
because
of
the
unexpected
flavors
but
this
one
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
strength
comes
through
in
the
flavor

the

loved
this
beer
from
first
5
years
ago
great
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
guinness
stout
only
sweeter
like
guinness
has
a
thick
head
when
poured
carefully
in
the
glass
has
become
very
difficult
to
find
in
peoria
area
its
a
really
good
porter
beer
is
medium
bodied
surprisingly
with
moderate
carbonation
to
propel
this
along
the
palate
quite
nicely
while
the
body
feels
a
bit
thin
its
still
quite
drinkable
finishes
dryly
with
a
small
bit
of
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
this
was
my
first
experience
diving
into
a
european
porter
or
stout
and
it
was
everything
i
couldve
hoped
for
and
more
o
overall
a
tasty
europorter
but
not
one
i
would
pick
over
a
fresh
us
version
of
the
style
too
much
alcohol
and
not
quite
enough
hops
or
even
malt
to
balance
it
imo
but
i
think
that
is
just
the
style
funny
i
am
realizing
it
isnt
easy
to
balance
abv
with
flavor
but
this
beer
or
two
would
go
really
well
on
a
lazy
saturday
afternoon
bbq
when
you
have
nowhere
to
go
or
no
work
the
next
day
o
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
olfrabrikken
but
damn
if
this
isnt
a
good
baltic
porter
for
2
99
for
500ml
you
cant
really
go
wrong
i
think
this
is

very

overall
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
with
a
lot
of
complexity
and
nice
balance
o
nice
flavor
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
enjoyable
and
something
i
would
have
again
i
know
its
a
matter
of
taste
but
this
stuff
is
really
sweet
its
educational
just
to
taste
the
powerful
malty
sweetness
without
the
distraction
of
hops
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
for
all
the
sweetness
this
beers
semidryness
is
dryer
than
id
expect
a
light
alcohol
kick
finishes
out
every
sip
drinkable
overall
and
at
the
price
point
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
game
changing
just
fit
to
style
od
not
a
chance
i
would
finish
this
too
sweet
i
was
able
to
drink
a
quarter
of
the
bottle
im
not
sure
what
the
deal
was
with
this
but
i
just
couldnt
handle
it
pop
instead
maybe
this
is
a
really
tasty
porter
tastes
very
good
feels
good
in
the
mouth
some
warmth
going
down
but
thats
okay
subtle
alcohol
otherwise
pretty
well
hidden
for
a
8
3
abv
if
youre
a
fan
of
porters
check
this
out
for
sure
on
a
side
note
it
was
cheap
flavorful
and
loaded
with
alcohol
it
will
get
the
job
done
i
would
purchase
this
if
i
was
planning
on
getting
drunk
on
something
with
flavor
and
on
the
cheap
side
well
i
guess
im
going
back
to
nagolskis
to
pick
this
thing
up
quite
a
bit
and
to
think
all
i
stopped
in
there
for
was
andouille
sausage
d
medium
to
high
d
i
could
have
a
couple
note
after
writing
this
review
i
ate
a
bowl
of
soup
and
went
back
to
finish
off
the
last
of
the
glass
and
i
got
the
strongest
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
that
i
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
if
this
were
oak
aged
or
bourbon
barrel
aged
i
would
praise
it
for
showing
such
clear
bourbon
flavors
anyway
needless
to
say
i
was
surprised
considering
that
this
probably
never
touch
oak
lower
carbonation
and
a
medium
full
body
gives
this
beer
and
decent
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
as
it
hides
the
abv
really
well
as
for
the
value
this
is
an
insane
great
deal
ive
passed
it
up
many
a
time
since
i
normally
buy
us
crafts
im
glad
dan
threw
one
in
as
an
extra
for
an
ip
trade
totally
drinkable
considering
the
style
and
heft
this
stuff
is
awesome
it
starts
off
with
a
toasty
flavor
and
then
finishes
with
chocolate
notes
the
only
way
to
drink
this
beer
is
at
room
temp
this
is
truly
a
meal
in
a
bottle
and
it
would
also
make
a
great
dessert
people
from
poland
know
how
to
eat
good
and
drink
good
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
this
is
a
real
dessert
beer
if
you
base
that
solely
on
the
level
of
sweetness
its
growing
on
me
and
its
very
rich
the
alcohol
is
too
subtle
some
more
warmth
or
burn
would
balance
or
cut
through
the
sweet
the
body
is
just
about
right
for
the
style
its
smooth
liquid
and
nearly
oily
this
particular
okocim
offering
is
always
very
consistent
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
when
in
the
mood
and
it
never
lets
me
down
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
change
from
my
ipa
cravings
overall
i
will
come
back
to
this
porter
it
was
a
great
price
and
had
a
nice
taste
and
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
thanks
to
the
sweet
taste
and
smell
great
experience
for
my
first
baltic
porter
its
cheap
too
meaning
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
typical
porterlike
just
about
mediumbodied
and
soft
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
are
all
there
but
maybe
the
alcohol
will
be
the
factor
that
limits
the
amount
of
glasses
youll
have
of
this
overall
a
pretty
nice
baltic
porter
a
lot
of
solid
flavors
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
ends
really
dry
fairly
drinkable
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
fluffy
tiny
bubbled
tan
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
light
roast
coffee
touch
of
smoke
and
milk
chocolate
medium
mouthfeel
the
roast
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
sublt
sweetness
that
lasts
throughout
ends
rather
dryly
and
cleanly
has
a
smooth
velvety
quality
to
it
that
is
really
nice
fairly
sweet
and
i
could
see
how
this
would
detract
from
the
overall
enjoyment
but
i
actually
like
it
as
fan
of
sweet
stouttsporters
no
real
bitter
or
leather
tastes
at
all
alocohol
is
well
hidden
drinkability
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
belly
warmer
all
the
way
down
gives
you
a
nice
contented
feel

i

while
this

so
what
was

years

is
just
plain
good
today
a
sipping
porter
better
to
pair
with
than
drink
on
its
own
d
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
porter
and
will
revisit
often
drinkability
whoa
this
is
a
total
sleeper
beer
i
picked
this
up
because
1
the
name
sounded
familiar
2
im
on
a
baltic
porter
kick
and
3
because
it
was

for
a

this
one
has
great
depth
of

incredibly
easydrinking
for
the
abv
nearly
unnoticeable
and
goes
down
smooth
if
you
love
baltic
porters
or
just
like
them
this
cannot
be
missed
worldclass
a
solid
baltic
porter
very
very
drinkable
im
seriously
surprised
how
high
this
beer
is
rated
the
brewers
other
beers
arent
rated
anywhere
as
high
as
this
porter
offering
i
would
expect
a
beer
of
this
mixed
quality
from
some
local
microcraft
brewer
who
hadnt
quite
gotten
it
right
not
from
a
150
year
old
brewer
but
apparently
some
reviewers
think
better
of
this
porter
i
dont
d
for
its
strength
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
consume
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
good
drinkability
not
the
best
porter
out
there
but
pretty
good
the
body
though
creamy
and
smooth
was
much
lighter
than
i
expected
it
was
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
could
have
used
a
bit
more
chew
great
flavors
of
dark
fruits
candied
licorice
light
milk
chocolate
and
the
finish
was
a
tad
sour
and
soysauce
like
all
in
all
not
a
bad
baltic
it
was
cheap
and
decent
id
have
it
again
d
as
someone
said
before
me
the
aftertaste
does
have
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
as
if
each
bach
is
brewed
with
a
handful
of
pennies
overall
the
excellent
taste
and
mouthfeel
do
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
at
at
2
50
a
bottle
wont
break
your
bank
and
will
likely
get
you
going
at

d
well
this
beer
is
a
great
value
at
1
99
a
bottle
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
too
often
as
the
metallic
taste
is
prominent
and
unpleasant
interesting
example
of
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
pors
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
some
red
tints
a
frothytan
head
tops
this
beer
and
has
good
lacing
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
take
over
the
nose
with
an
undertone
of
toasted
dark
malt
dark
chocolate
is
upfront
on
the
palate
followed
by
caramel
and
toasted
grain
flavors
rounded
of
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
medium
body
with
lasting
residual
flavors
not
a
bad
porter
at
all
one
i
will
enjoy
over
and
over
again
d
what
a
tight
beer
and
solid
drinker
i
must
say
that
the
amalgamation
of
flavors
help
shield
the
presence
of
any
alcohol
it
might
be
a
bit
rummy
but
i
find
that
it
hides
in
the
shadows
and
might
even
help
accentuate
some
of
the
other
flavors
one
of
the
better
baltic
porters
out
there
that
i
have
had
dark
brown
pour
with
chestnut
highlighting
tan
head
about
a
finger
in
thickness
but
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
staying

the
smell
is
cocoa
coffee
dr
pepper
and
used
motor
oil
vanilla
was
the
first
flavor
i
got
in
the
taste
then
comes
some
cocoa
dark
fruits
and
completely
agreeing
with
a
reviewer
right
below
this
root
beer
id
like
this
to
be
thicker
but
i

decent

yowza
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
one
and
done
on
this
bad
boy
though
just
too
sweet
and
too
strong
drinkability
i
rated
low
because
i
woudnt
have
more
than
1
in
a
night
its
the
type
of
beer
i
would
nurse
over
an
hour
and
enjoy
it
as
it
warms
up
drinkability
is
wonderful
what
an
excellent
porter
if
this
was
available
at
home
id
grab
it
often
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style

taste
a
lot
like
an
imperial
porter
nice
back
end
bitterness
but
wouldnt
want
to
sip
on
it
all
night
a
dark
coffee
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
was
extremely
short
lived
it
had
a
very
malty
aroma
with
a
touch
of
something
on
the
sweet
side
not
exactly
sure
of
what
it
was
though
the
taste
was
very
strong
on
the
malt
side
then
came
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
a
hint
of
chocolate
or
molasses
not
really
a
great
beer
but
also
not
a
bad
one
i
would
rate
this
at
a
middle
of
the
road
kind
of
beer
i
would
drink
one
again
but
i
will
not
be
in
a
hurry
trying
to
rush
to
the
store
to
get
another
i
spent
2
weeks
in
poland
and
drank
a
lot
of
okocim
but
never
came
across
this
porter
appearance
is
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
fair
off
tan
head
no
lace
smell
of
sweet
light
roasted
malts
chocolate
with
a
dark
fruit
note
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
from
start
to
finish
with
the
dark
fruits
light
chocolate
and
alchohol
mouthfeel
has
a
good
chewy
smooth
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
little
sweet
for
my
porter
palate
but
overall
a
nice
porter
dreally
easy
drinking
considering
the
abv
but
i
think
id
be
hard
pressed
to
finish
two
of
these
due
to
the
richness
of
this
beer
this
was
on
sale
for
like
4
im
glad
i
bought
it
as
it
was
worth
more
than
its
asking
price
ill
have
to
look
into
this
style
more
a
personal
favorite
ive
had
many
but
never
done
a
proper
review
i
prefer
this
a
little
bit
chilled
but
it
is
good
any
way
you
have
it
i
remember
the
first
time
tried
it
it
was
because
my
friend
didnt
want
to
finish
it
im
not
sure
if
it
was
too
rich
or
sweet
for
him
but
keep
in
mind
it
does
have
a
sweetness
that
some
may
find
overbearing
bottle
from
keg
liquors
in
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
tall
tan
head
with
fine
bubbles
medium
carbonation
that
fell
quickly
aroma
of
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
caramel
tastes
of
chocolate
roast
some
sweetness
like
toffee
low
to
no
hops
balanced
toward
sweetness
very
drinkable
could
have
another
d
pretty
well
for
the
style
good
as
a
sipper
enjoyable
even
when
it
was
a
little
cooler
overall
this
is
a
solid
yet
ultimately
unimpressive
baltic
porter
in
my
eyes
the
major
upside
for
this
is
the
price
as
i
could
drink
this
daily
and
still
spend
less
on
beer
than
i
do
now
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
although
there
are
other
baltic
porters
that
id
rather
have
than
this
i
love
okacims
lager
but
this
one
while
good
it
is
not
great
the
polish
obviously
know
a
good
bit
about
brewing
and
drinking
this
is
a
most
excellent
beer
that
i
will
hope
to
enjoy
again
sometime
a
nice
strong
winter
beer
drinkability
not
quite
sessionable
due
to
alcohol
youd
be
tempted
to
say
it
is
but
by
the
time
you
finished
it
youd
change
your
mind
this
beer
is
extremely
sweet
and
pure
cream
on
the
tongue
there
are
loads
of
sweet
and
dark
malts
going
on
here
there
is
a
slight
chicory
flavor
lots
of
sweet
chocolate
and
brown
malts
a
roasted
malt
note
underneath
some
charred
flavors
some
cocoa
powder
flavors
too
this
is
a
surprisingly
sweet
yet
complex
porter
that
is
a
pure
sweet
delight
it
is
strong
but
deceptively
so
with
no
real
indication
of
its
strength
beware
the
charred
and
more
drying
hop
characteristics
what
there
is
of
them
comes
through
more
in
the
finish
there
is
definitely
an
oily
finish
on
the
tongue
but
very
little
aftertaste
and
just
maybe
the
slightest
abv
warming
notes
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
treat
lchaim
very
lagerish
in
general
but
in
the
body
particularly
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
a
lager
yeast
was
used
or
if
it
was
an
ale
yeast
that
it
was
cold
stored
at
the
brewery
like
i
said
my
attempted
research
was
thwarted
i
would
have
liked
the
body
to
be
chewier
but
really
theres
little
to
complain
about
in
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
wow
what
a
great
beer
for
the
price
and
its
an
import
too
this
is
goignt
o
be
a
staple
for
me
now
great
beer
md
nice
full
mouth
on
this
one
accompanied
by
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
highly
drinkable
and
a
great
bang
for
your
buck
overall
very
drinkable
and
delicious
the
mouth
feel
was
pretty
fullbodied
while
still
being
pretty
drinkable
a
little
bit
of
heat
in
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
make
it
unbalanced
decent
body
to
this
one
cant
knock
it
although
it
doesnt
really
facilitate
the
drinkability
body
makes
the
sugar
cling
to
the
mouth
alcohol
cuts
some
of
the
sweetness
but
overall
this
is
lacking
1
95
for
1
pt
0
9
oz
so
it
was
a
deal
but
no
way
am
i
buying
this
again
nothing
off
on
this
one
just
very
differently
crafted
not
my
tastestyle
drinkability
is
good
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
a
pretty
nice
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
would
definitely
buy
another
very
good
porter
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
loves
mouthfeel
is
a
little
disappointing
not
much
there
but
allows
you
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
this
beer
pours
a
impressive
jet
black
colour
which
lets
absolutely
no
light
thru
and
leaves
a
one
finger
creamy
head
with
beautiful
lacing
everywherethe
aromas
are
strong
dark
coffee
and
dark
chocolateit
has
a
full
mouthfeel
which
finishes
medium
bodied
with
big
tastes
of
dark
fruitsdark
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
palette
which
finishes
a
little
bitter
but
not
extremequite
a
nice
brew
that
would
be
beautiful
for
sipping
on
a
cold
winters
night
in
front
of
the
fireplace
drinkability
would
definitely
buy
another
very
good
porter
solid
really
good
very
excellent
priced
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
if
not
overly
thick
drinkabilitypretty
good
it
shocked
me
because
it
was
so
sweet
im
so
used
to
bitter
beers
that
i
nursed
it
because
it
was
so
sweet
and
rich
it
was
a
good
beer
though
i
would
drink
it
again
oh
i
forgot
to
mention
one
of
the
best
parts
of
this
beer
it
is
relatively
cheap
the
only
reason
i
stumbled
across
it
was
because
i
was
put
off
by
the
price
of
other
specialty
beers
and
wanted
something
that
was
a
little
more
cost
effective
great
porter
will
buy
agian
i
bought
this
based
upon
a
previous
recommendation
and
at
2
69
why
not
dark
black
looks
like
a
porter
to
me
it
smells
like
syrupy
molasses
but
it
is
faint
yet
sticky
the
flavor
is
super
malty
and
complex
fruity
nuts
molasses
brown
sugar
what
the
hell
i
guess
i
dont
know
much
about
baltic
porters
because
this
is
much
different
than
what
i
expected
but
it
is
still
good
my
first
polish
beer
everything
you
would
expect
from
a
baltic
porter
and
then
some
malty
molasses
that
hits
the
nose
first
followed
by
bitter
chocolate
then
coffee
just
as
i
thought
theres
no
way
the
taste
could
compare
to
the
nose
i
was
beside
myself
so
much
more
going
on
in
my
book
a
truly
epic
brew
drinkability
its
tasty
but
not
exactly
a
session
beer
the
high
alcohol
and
relatively
complex
fruit
flavors
suggest
to
me
a
dessert
beer
of
which
id
probably
have
just
one
this
is
not
a
brew
for
the
meek
if
youre
interested
in
trying
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
i
suggest
you
give
this
one
a
try
this
one
is
special
ive
just
started
sampling
some
of
the
porter
beers
some
that
were
even
rated
very
high
this
one
stand
out
coffe
caramel
aroma
flavor
its
got
everything
i
dont
know
if
it
was
a
super
fresh
batch
i
picked
up
but
im
heading
over
there
tomorrow
and
picking
up
a
whole
case
drinkability
is
good
the
brew
seems
to
do
all
the
right
things
in
the
wrong
way
too
sweet
a
touch
metallic
in
the
nose
and
not
enough
roasted
malt
to
sustain
the
rich
and
sweet
character
hopefully
these
negative
thoughts
are
from
a
bad
bottle
oh
well
that
just
means
another
bottle
is
going
to
have
to
make
its
way
in
front
of
this
ba
d
well
its
delicious
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
keep
feeling
challenged
to
find
more
aromas
and
flavors
in
there
so
it
makes
me
want
more
and
to
experience
it
at
the
full
range
of
temperatures
8
3
says
the
label
a
good
time
had
by
any
who
drinks
this
it
was
pretty
cool
i
like
these
baltics
and
for
a
macro
owned
brew
this
seems
to
nail
the
style
well
cheers
d
not
something
i
could
drink
every
day
but
a
nice
change
and
would
go
great
as
a
nightcap
or
with
a
rich
dessert
a
juicy
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
palate
very
little
heat
if
any
other
than
the
overly
intense
fruit
juice
sweetness
that
pervades
at
the
latter
end
this
is
a
wellrefined
b
p
for
an
8er
and
a
classic
that
deserves
to
be
called
so
good
job
poland
a
decent
value
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
actually
the
high
abv
was
hidden
quite
well
in
my
opinion
will
definitely
grab
another
next
time
i
run
to
bevmo
just
to
have
around
the
house
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
baltic
porter
great
with
dessert
or
just
dandy
by
itself
as
i
am
enjoying
it
now
this
is
going
to
be
a
frequent
resident
in
my
fridge
from
now
on
d
deducted
some
points
for
slightly
odd
flavors
and
noticeable
alcohol
drinkability
is
really
nice
for
a
baltic
porter
with
an
abv
of
8
3
there
is
some
very
nice
taste
to
this
beer
but
it
all
balances
together
making
this
a
high
alcohol
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
definitely
try
if
you
can
find
it
if
you
like
sweet
beer
i
would
recommend
this
im
not
usually
a
big
porter
guy
but
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
overall
amazing
drinkability
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
the
texture
matches
the
flavors
very
well
nice
sweetness
balanced
by
roasty
dry
flavorfeel
no
alcohol
detected
sorry
okocim
this
one
is
not
worth
the
trouble
to
find
the
first
baltic
porter
than
really
piqued
my
interest
was
ølfabrikken
so
i
suppose
ive
been
a
bit
spoiled
when
it
comes
to
the
style
this
isnt
a
bad
example
just
a
bit
too
cloying
for
my
taste
the
bleach
on
the
nose
didnt
help
whats
up
with
that
d
well
its
drinkin
darn
fine
for
right
now
ill
have
to
see
what
i
feel
like
afterward
definitely
a
beer
for
a
colder
evening
or
watching
a
late
night
game
of
rugby
on
the
tv
i
dont
consider
this
highly
drinkable
500
ml
was
far
too
much
for
me
to
finish
pours
to
a
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
tint
at
the
bottom
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
lingers
thru
midglass
and
leaves
decent
lacing
aroma
right
out
of
the
bottle
is
a
malty
mix
of
chocolate
toffe
and
dark
fruits
and
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sweet
taste
follows
in
step
with
the
nose
and
the
8
3
alcohol
enters
into
both
the
nose
and
mouth
at
midglass
this
all
rounds
off
to
a
nice
long
warming
finish
i
really
liked
this
one
although
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
aminly
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
very
much
a
sipper
take
the
time
to
really
enjoy
this
one
not
what
id
call
a
subtle
beer
this
one
lets
you
know
right
from
the
start
this
is
a
beer
not
to
be
taken
lightly
my
first
polish
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
has
a
chocolate
maltly
taste
that
the
smell
hints
to
but
it
is
much
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
drinkability
is
lacking
for
me
due
to
the
high
abv
and
overall
sweetness
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
porter
i
thought
i
died
and
went
to
heaven
dark
reddish
brown
with
rich
tan
head
that
lingers
full
mouth
feel
and
smell
with
the
dark
malts
coming
through
not
overly
hopped
but
well
balanced
if
you
like
baltic
porters
or
would
like
to
try
one
this
is
a
good
first
go
d
does
not
feel
like
a
8
1
abv
quite
drinkable
but
itll
knock
you
off
your
feet
quick
if
youre
not
careful
d
this
is
a
very
good
and
classic
example
of
this
eastern
european
style
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
8
dark
beers
i
have
had
paired
well
with
some
frenchmade
gruyere
style
cheese
i
was
eating
at
less
than
2
50
for
500
mlcalculated
to

a
bomber
one
of
the
best
values
out
there
poured
from
tap
into
12oz
hourglass
pitch
black
with
a
little
bit
of
a
white
head
smells
a
little
grassy
and
grainy
dark
but
not
heavy
didnt
seam
to
hold
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
i
dont
know
if
thats
intentional
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
simple
low
bitterness
and
light
mouthfeel
might
be
a
nice
option
on
a
hot
day
d
a
higher
alcohol
content
than
your
average
beer
a
little
over
8
of
course
it
is
not
a
beer
to
get
drunk
to
even
though
its
possible
someone
who
is
not
accustomed
to
beer
may
not
enjoy
it
but
for
those
of
us
who
are
it
is
very
enjoyable
overall
great
bang
for
the
ol
buck
brew
will
have
again
just
not
a
lot
at
one
sitting
solid
brown
pour
off
white
head
earthypeaty
roast
malt
aroma
sweet
malt
and
chocolate
up
front
some
slight
dark
red
fruit
pretty
carbonated
medium
body
there
are
hints
of
malt
liquor
throughout
there
is
alcohol
warming
from
this
very
clean
finishing
solid
eastern
european
version
of
the
style
pretty
drinkable
and
not
too
tough
to
find
usually
a
good
standard
standbye
for
those
that
enjoy
baltic
porters
certainly
a
good
beer
but
500ml
was
a
bit
much
for
me
a
bit
disappointing
but
i
had
built
it
up
for
a
while
i
dont
think
i
could
get
through
more
than
one
of
these
since
its
such
a
strong
tasting
and
high
abv
baltic
porter
that
being
said
i
am
definitely
enjoying
the
one
that
i
am
drinking
very
good
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
watery
sweet
and
clean
on
the
tongue
with
a
good
viscosity
chocolate
hint
of
coffee
and
cinnamon
a
bit
of
graininess
on
the
finish
gives
it
more
body
carbonation
is
appropriately
light
to
moderate
slightly
chewy
in
the
malts
on
the
finish
decent
feel
and
drinkability
and
quite
robust
obviously
a
different
animal
than
your
typical
american
porter
worth
a
try
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
i
would
pay
because
these
are
so
heavy
and
evil
there
is
a
beautiful
demon
inside
every
bottle
mean
and
full
of
flavor
highly
recommended
overall
a
little
too
simple
and
inoffensive
to
be
the
best
porter
in
the
world
but
still
an
excellent
beer

this
is
a
great
brew
flavorful
and
complex
i
would
surely
recommend
based
on
flavor
alone
at
the
price
i
paid
i
think
2
50
i
would
highly
recommend
a
must
try
not
to
mention
the
8
alcohol
means
one
16
oz
bottle
and
you
are
set
for
the
evening
mouthfeel
is
awesome
creamy
roasty
light
bitterness
highly
drinkable
okocim
porter
is
good
alright
there
i
said
it
i
prefer
more
roast
and
bitter
character
in
beers
of
this
style
but
if
you
havent
had
this
fruity
maltbomb
you
should
at
around
4
a
bottle
there
is
barely
any
reason
not
to
give
it
the
ole
college
try
just
to
warnive
had
this
quite
a
few
times
now
and
serving
temp
makes
all
the
difference
be
sure
to
have
this
on
the
warmer
side
to
be
frank
i
havent
had
a
bettertasting
baltic
porter
than
this
no
noticeable
metallic
tinges
with
other
bps
from
the
same
region
im
looking
at
you
baltika
instead
luxurious
notes
of
portlike
dark
chocolate
and
raisin
rum
bread
coat
the
palate
the
middle
is
sweet
and
complex
as
nuttiness
and
hops
drop
in
before
a
finish
of
warming
booze
and
fig
body
is
medium
in
thickness
and
nicely
carbonated
but
the
highlight
here
is
the
flavor
paired
superbly
with
a
plate
of
pork
tenderloin
and
potatoes
and
im
sure
it
would
go
well
with
other
meals
ill
definitely
be
having
this
again
sometime
d
a
bit
too
much
for
great
drinkability
but
still
enjoyable
much
more
accessible
than
the
smell
suggested
i
will
have
to
pick
this
up
again
sometime
drinkability
is
good
even
though
ive
only
had
just
this
one
bottle
great
price
not
that
heavy
or
strong
tasty
and
well
made
what
more
can
you
ask
for
im
not
sure
when
this
was
made
but
it
has
that
rounded
feel
that
either
comes
from
age
or
is
a
huge
testament
to
the
brewmaster
sure
its
a
bit
thicker
then
palone
but
if
youve
had
that
beer
then
you
realize
how
expertly
crafted
this
is
from
now
on
when
i
think
bp
im
thinking
okocim
smooth
creamy
fullbodied
with
medium
effervescence
very
high
quality
beer
good
stuff
500ml
bottle
8
3
abv
deasy
enough
to
drink
but
this
one
is
almost
too
sweet
for
me
d
a
deceptive
8
it
seems
a
lot
smoother
and
lighter
its
easy
to
suck
it
back
like
theres
no
tomorrow
but
dont
expect
to
do
so
without
feeling
the
results
good
stuff
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlight
with
some
tan
foam
that
left
very
little
lacing
aroma
of
dry
chocolate
some
dark
fruit
slightly
sour
smelling
sweet
flavor
slightest
hints
of
coffee
rum
soaked
fruit
raisin
dark
chocolate
flavor
is
nice
but
not
overpowering
slightly
sour
taste
as
well
i
think
this
bottle
might
have
some
age
on
it
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
just
right
it
was
an
ok
brew
but
would
probably
be
much
better
fresh
drinkability
stays
low
because
of
the
funkiness
and
high
abv
d
this
is
a
baltic
that
will
stick
to
your
ribs
its
very
thick
and
sweet
and
will
warm
you
up
with
ease
on
those
chilly
midwest
winter
evenings
drinkability
if
you
want
to
tie
one
on
this
is
the
beer
for
you
very
high
alcohol
content
however
this
isnt
the
reason
why
i
drink
beer
a
cheap
macro
would
do
this
for
you
d
its
a
slow
sipper
all
the
way
as
it
started
off
a
bit
assertively
the
alcohol
didnt
seem
all
that
well
hidden
until
the
beer
warmed
its
a
good
cold
weather
warmer
id
try
it
again
d
for
the
price
this
was
a
great
deal
and
a
very
delicious
night
cap
straight
from
the
motherland
so
it
is
my
intention
to
try
many
more
of
these
in
the
future
with
some
quality
polish
metal
ok
so
this
brew
is
fantastic
if
you
like
porters
this
is
a
must
try
it
has
a
nose
that
is
very
roasted
barley
and
dark
coffee
and
cocoa
but
the
taste
is
extremely
chocolatey
i
love
this
beer
it
is
really
a
great
example
of
a
good
porter
get
it
drink
it
love
it
great
stuff
will
buy
again
the
dark
and
sweet
characteristics
are
perfect
for
when
you
want
to
drink
solely
to
drink
a
really
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
porters
for
sure
and
i
wish
i
would
have
found
it
sooner
d
a
deceptive
8abv
beer
drinks
very
smooth
add
to
that
a
great
taste
and
eexceptional
mouthfeel
and
you
have
on
your
hands
one
spectacularly
drinkable
beer
on
the
right
side
of
this
site
it
says
that
all
5s
should
be
very
rare
well
i
think
ive
found
an
opportunity
to
give
a
few
out
though
ive
not
heard
of
this
company
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
i
picked
this
brew
up
at
a
local
liquor
store
out
of
mere
curiousity
for
what
you
get
this
is
a
great
deal
its
about
2
99
for
0
5
l
of
this
wonderful
beer
as
one
reviewer
below
me
put
it
its
the
cheapest
ticket
to
heaven
that
youll
ever
buy
ill
have
to
check
for
both
other
beers
of
this
style
and
other
beers
from
this
brewery
a
nice
beer
here
i
felt
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
forward
for
my
tastes
and
this
tended
towards
cloying
at
times
but
worth
looking
to
try
the
taste
is
spice
prunes
and
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
licorice
and
a
daint
hint
of
port
its
mostly
sweet
with
no
clear
bitterness
except
a
spicy
bite
is
full
rich
smooth
and
a
bit
oily
with
a
noticeable
but
pleasant
alcoholic
warmth
from
start
to
finish
the
finish
is
long
but
suprisingly
clean
and
chocolaty
with
fruit
and
warming
alcohol
this
stuff
really
only
has
a
couple
of
flaws
first
and
foremost
the
8
3
alcohol
keeps
it
from
being
sessionable
secondly
its
such
a
rich
beer
that
one
is
really
all
that
you
need
other
than
that
this
is
the
porter
that
all
other
porters
wish
that
they
could
be
drink
it
love
it
and
do
it
with
gusto
folks
at
2
99
for
a
500
ml
bottle
its
the
cheapest
ticket
to
heaven
that
youll
ever
buy
this
beer
had
a
nice
black
pour
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
had
caramel
and
alcohol
with
an
underlying
note
of
plums
the
body
has
a
nice
bready
maltiness
with
some
chocolate
in
it
it
finishes
well
with
a
slight
smokiness
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
very
crisp
finish
for
a
dark
8
abv
beer
body
is
oddly
light
and
airy
good
drinkability
but
a
little
cloying
d
to
be
a
dark
robust
beer
with
an
8
3
abv
this
is
damn
drinkable
one
of
my
first
wow
beers
in
awhile
i
cant
believe
ive
overlooked
this
for
so
long
and
at
the
price
this
is
one
of
the
best
values
out
there
highly
recommended
d
i
wish
that
i
bought
more
than
one
of
these
this
is
definitely
a
great
surprise
at
just
about
2
per
500ml
bottle
overall
this
is
one
the
best
beers
that
ive
ever
tried
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
will
seek
this
one
out
on
a
regular
basis
nice
full
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
a
sipping
beer
baltic
porters
are
always
bold
adventures
it
is
a
notably
distinct
style
okocims
example
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
magnificent
i
know
of
its
also
an
excellent
candidate
for
the
cellar
this
bottle
drinking
better
than
ever
at
one
year
past
the
best
before
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
could
find
in
my
travels
through
poland
if
polish
brewers
are
gifted
in
one
style
surely
this
must
be
it
poured
almost
black
in
color
that
had
a
good
head
that
was
caramel
in
color
kept
some
bubbles
around
the
glass
as
drank
also
a
little
lacing
smelled
of
alcohol
chocolate
malt
and
sweet
reminded
me
of
a
wine
smell
tasted
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
also
chocolate
and
malt
then
again
tasted
a
little
on
the
wine
side
felt
excellent
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
good
you
could
tell
that
you
had
something
in
your
mouth
felt
a
little
thicker
i
could
drink
these
all
the
time
you
would
have
to
be
carfull
the
higher
alcohol
content
was
evident
a
good
baltic
porter
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
nice
if
i
wanted
something
sweet
and
slightly
boozy
d
not
impressed
it
was
too
sweet
way
too
sweet
sweet
vs
bitter
good
battle
great
porter
theres
something
about
this
that
captivates
me
not
what
im
used
to
this
bottle
kept
me
intrigued
nice
roasty
aroma
with
a
powerful
sweetness
reminiscent
of
dark
fruits
pour
is
nice
and
medium
dark
with
a
great
tan
head
and
lots
of
visually
wonderful
lacing
moderately
thin
compared
to
american
porter
standards
but
very
creamy
and
fullfilling
afterwards
interesting
flavor
really
sweet
considering
but
it
works
nicely
there
is
almost
a
port
quality
here
bitter
and
amazingly
sweet
this
one
is
very
good
d
drinks
great
for
such
a
high
abv
picked
up
a
500
ml
bottle
of
this
beer
in
davis
square
poured
in
to
my
ommegang
chocolate
indulgence
chalice
a
near
black
complexion
that
has
hues
of
ruby
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
was
strong
with
dark
fruits
such
as
cherries
and
prunes
rich
dark
chocolate
and
a
perfume
of
alcohol
are
also
there
taste
is
pretty
amazing
with
much
of
the
same
plus
cola
and
a
nice
caramel
flavor
that
is
mildly
reminiscent
of
a
doppelbock
body
is
heavy
hoppy
and
bursting
at
the
seams
with
complexity
drinking
okocim
porter
should
be
a
process
of
sipping
and
savoring
so
that
all
of
those
interesting
traits
come
to
the
forefront
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
this
is
a
style
that
i
have
been
losing
faith
in
as
of
late
as
many
of
them
just
do
not
seem
all
that
complex
this
is
an
exception
drinkability
i
thought
it
pretty
darn
good
for
a
style
i
usually
dont
drink
much
of
im
sold
terrific
porter
all
the
complexities
of
ale
brewing
with
the
painstaking
caretaking
of
lagers
evident
as
well
d
this
beer
hits
you
hard
and
fast
mainly
an
after
dinner
treat
as
it
would
be
a
bit
cumbersome
to
drink
more
than
a
few
notes
its
overall
drinkability
for
me
was
low
due
to
its
unchecked
and
unbalanced
syrupy
sweetness
the
alcohol
had
some
ruff
edges
as
well
still
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
there
is
a
khaki
colored
head
sitting
proud
over
an
near
black
body
the
strong
aroma
gives
off
a
bouquet
of
cherry
currents
and
booze
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
body
is
thick
and
silky
but
it
doesnt
stick
to
your
mouth
there
is
a
lot
of
complexity
in
this
porter
with
big
fruit
flavors
balanced
by
chocolate
and
coffee
there
is
enough
alcohol
in
it
to
warm
you
all
the
way
down
but
you
can
only
detect
it
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
standard
barer
of
this
style
for
me
try
it
with
dark
chocolate
covered
strawberries
or
tofu
in
a
brown
mole
with
roasted
corn
another
decent
baltic
porter
from
eastern
europe
i
cant
say
that
this
one
possesses
any
special
qualities
that
make
it
stand
out
from
the
others
but
its
a
good
beer
if
you
like
the
style
give
it
a
try
recommended
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
d
yes
its
a
very
easy
drink
dark
rich
opaque
brownishblack
color
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
raisins
plums
roasted
malts
caramel
and
chocolate
taste
explodes
in
your
mouth
with
nice
texture
extremely
flavorful
with
malts
and
chocolate
most
prevalent
really
nice
porter
definitely
recommended
drinkability
i
paid
around
3
for
the
bottle
and
i
think
thats
a
great
price
despite
it
being
on
the
sweeter
side
with
less
hops
to
counterbalance
its
not
overpoweringly
sweet
and
there
are
a
lot
of
complex
malt
flavors
the
roasted
and
darker
flavors
seem
to
combat
the
sweetness
a
bit
too
id
certainly
buy
this
again
and
as
a
dessert
beer
after
dinner
this
was
ultimately
very
satisfying
this
beer
is
super
easy
to
drink
albiet
sweeter
than
any
porter
i
can
call
to
mind
at
the
moment
d
excellent
drinking
beer
goes
down
smooth
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
pondered
a
vacation
to
poland
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
maltbomb
ive
ever
had
its
packed
with
the
flavors
all
dark
beer
fans
want
dried
fruit
coffee
chocolate
and
maybe
a
little
licoriceanise
in
the
finish
as
it
warms
d
i
think
i
could
drink
this
until
i
was
dreaming
the
flavors
are
beautifully
matched
and
the
alcohol
is
kept
at
bay
with
the
velvety
goodness
that
grabs
your
attention
absolutely
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
smooth
and
rich
in
the
mouth
at
first
with
a
relatively
clean
watery
finish
d
i
have
become
a
fan
of
brown
porters
and
this
baltic
porter
falls
right
in
my
comfort
range
i
have
and
will
purchase
this
beer
again
and
again
d
closer
to
a
stout
than
most
porters
i
am
used
to
but
that
seems
to
fit
the
style
alcohol
is
high
but
not
much
of
a
factor
in
taste
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
compared
to
its
abv
i
can
think
of
a
beer
i
would
love
to
try
fresh
ontap
d
delicious
for
an
end
meal
or
end
of
the
night
beer
this
would
be
a
wonderful
nightcap
and
it
was
but
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
a
full
bottle
in
one
sitting
that
said
i
would
probably
purchase
this
beer
again
but
for
the
specific
purpose
of
celebration
or
nightcap
overall
baltic
in
baltic
porter
very
heavy
very
strong
very
potent
and
very
warming
this
beer
would
have
been
alot
of
fun
in
college
d
a
nice
fireside
warmer
500ml
bottle
that
can
be
split
or
consumed
solo
d
a
good
night
cap
beer
would
be
nice
on
a
cold
night
in
front
of
a
fire
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
a
well
done
baltic
porter
for
sure
drinkability
very
tasty
not
a
subtle
porter
but
one
that
delivers
higher
alcohol
and
big
flavors
this
wont
be
my
last
bottle
this
tastes
exactly
like
a
baltic
porter
should
in
fact
all
porter
should
taste
like
this
hell
all
beers
should
taste
like
this
well
perhaps
not
but
as
for
tonight
this
beer
is
divine
the
malt
comes
a
bit
sweet
and
chocolates
come
around
and
hints
at
molasses
pine
hop
oil
coffee
toffee
and
dark
skinned
fruits
fanfriggintastic
the
body
is
solid
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
feels
silky
smooth
all
the
way
down
i
did
a
doubletake
when
i
wondered
about
the
abv
8
dont
even
feel
it
till
well
after
but
still
manages
to
warm
the
soul
ill
have
to
visit
this
one
often
d
its
rich
and
creamy
making
it
a
nice
taste
treat
that
is
a
wonderful
winter
warmer
or
late
cold
night
brew
in
the
world
of
bjcp
judging
a
50
is
the
top
score
and
never
assigned
a
45
is
as
high
as
one
normally
goes
this
beer
is
a
46
if
it
was
a
spinal
tap
amplifier
it
would
go
to
11
get
my
drift
dont
pass
this
up
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
a
bottle
in
good
condition
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
porter
worth
trying
for
sure
pours
a
virtually
opaque
black
with
a
great
tan
head
that
sticks
around
nose
is
sweet
like
chocolate
would
be
but
is
overall
mild
and
has
no
extreme
character
flavor
is
very
smooth
but
at
the
same
time
is
very
sweet
i
want
to
say
it
is
bordering
on
too
sweet
if
it
has
not
already
crossed
that
line
slight
malt
tones
underneath
all
that
sugary
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
low
with
carbonation
drinkable
sure
but
for
some
the
extreme
sweet
might
be
a
turn
off
the
8
3
is
extremely
wellincorporated
thats
the
abv
given
on
this
bottle
i
wont
say
wellhidden
because
its
there
as
a
warming
undercurrent
overall
an
insanely
delicious
offering
im
not
ubercrazy
about
typical
porters
but
once
you
put
baltic
in
front
of
it
im
in
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
ive
had
like
the
best
doppelbocks
this
is
what
id
call
comfort
beer
time
to
stock
up
suprisingly
drinkable
for
its
sweet
malt
structure
the
taste
is
kept
in
good
balance
by
the
bitter
hops
and
alcohols
i
cant
drink
this
fast
but
can
drink
it
all
evening
long
another
factor
contributing
to
the
drinkability
is
its
price
at
only
2
50
a
bottlewithout
case
discount
this
is
a
great
value
delicious
porter
highly
suggested

with

on
the
palate
followed
by
a
roasty

hoppy
finish
medium

can
be

a

it
also
finishes
well
leaving
me
with
the
roasted
flavor
i
find
that
it
goes
well
with
smoked
mozzarella
and
i
have
also
had
it
to
follow
up
a
sumptuous
roast
turkey
dinner
with
all
the
trimmings
having
more
than
one
of
these
would
be
all
too
easy
a
gem
from
mother
poland
very
smooth
and
a
beer
that
easily
masks
its
rather
high
abv
8

according
to
its
label
just
outstanding
a
must
try
and
to
me
a
very
close
second
to
the
taddy
porter
atop
my
own
list
of
preferred
porters
at
2
29
at
the
local
piccadilly
this
is
an
absolute
steal
this
is
a
pleasurable
but
sweet
porter
dfirst
one
went
down
faster
than
expected
on
to
the
next
drinkability
excellent
this
beer
manages
to
maintain
a
sense
of
balance
despite
its
heavy
abv
and
bold
flavorings
making
it
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
its
size
a
liter
in
im
done
the
boiler
isnt
working
but
my
belly
is
warm
time
for
bed
overall
a
nice
complex
porter
a
little
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
dark
coffeecolored
porter
there
was
barely
any
head
but
what
was
there
was
light
brown
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
i
smell
a
sweet
molasseslike
aroma
combined
with
an
almost
smokey
roasted
malt
smell
perhaps
i
detect
chocolate
as
well
i
could
be
fooling
myself
but
i
could
swear
i
smell
the
alcohol
content
tastes
like
a
very
good
porter
semi
sweet
and
warm
from
the
8

alcohol
slight
bitter
aftertaste
hint
of
smokey
roasted
malty
overtones
very
smooth
and
heavy
with
little
carbonation
like
a
good
porter
usually
is
the
high
alcohol
content
and
heavyness
makes
this
beer
a
twobeeranight
kind
of
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
would
make
an
excellent
appetizer
to
a
meal
i
like
it
a
lot
opinion
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
has
a
deep
depth
of
flavor
and
is
really
deceptively
drinkeable
for
being
such
a
strong
beer
the
fruity
notes
compliment
the
whole
ensemble
and
this
ends
up
being
really
refreshing
if
it
werent
for
the
8
alcohol
this
beer
is
bordering
on
a
dark
lager
but
the
fruitiness
sets
it
apart
from
that
category
either
way
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
if
given
the
opportunity
not
as
fruity
as
i
was
expecting
but
quite
something
of
a
style
i
dont
seek
out
often
this
beer
went
very
well
with
a
few
pieces
of
cacao
reserve
extra
dark
chocolate
drinkability
superb
tasting
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
wonderful
porter
everyone
should
try
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
head
is
modest
and
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
vanilla
nicely
roasted
malts
toffee
and
dried
fruit
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
there
is
definite
alcohol
here
but
it
is
in
harmony
with
a
sweeter
malty
profile
with
nice
accents
of
espresso
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
crave
but
still
quite
respectable
all
in
all
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
i
think
sinebrychoff
has
more
depth
but
at
2
25
for
a
pint
bottle
of
okocim
versus
3
for
the
smaller
synebrychoff
this
is
an
excellent

pretty

d
wow
i
can
not
believe
this
porter
is
at

it
is
too
smooth
the
alcohol
presence
is
superbly
masked
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
i
would
pick
this
up
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
solid

pours

a
very

the
mouth
feels
fantastic
holding
the
beer
crisp
as
a
beer
should
taste
but
somewhat
understated
to
my
palate
very
agreeable
i
would
rate
this
as
a
very
drinkable
beer
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
another
and
would
highly
recommend
anyone
especially
those
that
like
the
darker
beers
pick
one
up
edit
per
the
new
ba
magazine
some
baltic
porters
utilize
lager
yeast
maybe
thats
why
im
picking
up
all
of
the
doppelbock
similarities
in
closing
this
is
a
great
drink
the
warmth
at
the
end
really
sells
this
drink
to
me
and
i
look
forward
to
keeping
a
few
in
my
minifridge
for
after
a
long
day
of
work
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
nice
feeling
that
reminds
me
of
when
i
drank
more
hard
liquor
and
its
a
feeling
i
enjoy

i
am
happy

with

that
and
every
thing
considered
you
cant
beat
this
beer
if
you
see
it
and
you
pass
it
up
your
loss
and
more
for
me
taste
is
heavy
and
leans
on
the

side

not
cloyingly
so
lots
of
roasted

bitterness
with
an
acidic

alcohol
certainly
hits

as

this
isnt

most
complex
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
very
nice
almost
like
a

thats
not
so
sweet
youll
hurt
your

in

thanks
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
dark
dark
brown
with
deep
mahogany
highlights
it
had
an
average
head
that
whittled
down
to
a
collar
of
thin
foam
the
smell
was
roasted
malt
in
the
back
with
a
dark
fruitiness
raisin
maybe
dominating
as
im
not
a
fan
of
the
raisin
smell
in
beers
it
took
a
hit
in
the
rating
the
taste
was
pretty
good
but
again
dominated
by
the
raisin
taste
so
hard
to
enjoy
this
is
my
first
baltic
porter
so
im
hoping
this
isnt
standard
for
the
style
as
ive
really
gotten
into
american
and
english
porters
this
year
overall
id
give
it
a
mild
recommendation
and
one
is
probably
enough
for
me
3
5
nabot
ml
o
its
boldly
malty
craftily
complex
and
blended
and
meshed
and
artful
its
a
shameless
malt
monster
down
to
earth
and
gutsy
with
assertive
character
the
abv
is
brassy
but
its
so
integrated
that
its
just
a
happy
warmer
is
all
the
great
reputation
is
one
thing
the
reality
may
just
be
even
better
thick
and
in
your
face
if
you
drink
more
than
one
trouble
might
be
right
behind
high
alcohol
expressiveness
so
know
your
limitations
recommended
drinkability
well
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
may
the
weather
is
cool
and
this
seemed
liek
a
perfect
drink
for
the
fall
like
day
nice
and
tasty

porter

steroids
without
being
over
the
top

malts
with
chocolate
fruits
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
in
there
darn
good
taste
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
balanced
by
a
sweet
fruity
taste
after
mouthfeel
is
good
and
medium
to
full
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
and
will
have
to
pick
it
up
now
that
they
have
it
in
my
former
home
nc
quite
drinkable
if
you
didnt
get
the
point
big
thanks
to
bort11
for
this
bottle
that
he
got
for
1
99
drinkable
and
affordable
is
never
a
bad
thing
this
poured
a
a
deep
opaque
there
is
a
very
light
tan
head
that
isnt
too
thick
and
doesnt
leave
too
much
lacing
as
it
warms
the
aromas
turn
to
a
nice
roasty
chocolate
flavor
there
seems
to
be
some
slight
dms
to
this
flavor
there
is
a
slight
hop
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
gets
stronger
as
wel
as
it
warms
the
chocolate
and
bready
roast
comes
out
and
balances
well
with
everything
in
there
warm
silky
chocolate
roast
and
the
light
slight
bready
taste
come
together
great
with
the
light
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
something
to
really
take
in
all
in
all
it
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
one
of
the
best
d
obviously
not
a
session
beer
im
loving
this
one
but
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
a
night
definitely
recommended
i
dont
typically
favor
porters
or
stouts
and
also
wouldnt
expect
much
from
a
beer
that
was
not
from
one
the
top
beer
countries
but
wow
this
beer
was
of
course
quite
dark
with
tan
head
smell
was
of
huge
dark
bready
malts
with
espresso
and
chocolate
notes
dominant
big
malt
sweetness
upfront
balanced
out
well
by
the
bitter
roasty
flavors
and
the
hops
which
play
a
supporting
role
in
this
beer
cant
detect
much
from
the
hops
other
than
their
background
presence
to
provide
balance
somehow
manages
to
finish
crisp
enough
to
leave
you
wanting
more
slightly
heavy
mouthfeel
if
i
ever
want
a
dark
malty
big
beer
this
would
be
a
top
choice
thanks
to
the
florida
gators
for
the
beer
drinkability
i
honestly
dont
know
if
this
has
benefited
from
age
or
not
its
a
different
experience
but
not
necessarily
better
or
worse
highly
recommended
one
of
the
absolute
best
porters
i
have
ever
had
a
pour
into
nonic
glass
from
5
liter
bottle
produced
huge
2
head
with
a
perisistent
head
and
good
lacing
head
eventually
collapsed
to
tight
18
on
2nd
pour
into
12
oz
glass
very
dark
brown
wa
off
white
to
tan
head
minimal
fine
carbonation
smell
is
a
mixture
of
very
slight
roast
some
slight
sourness
very
sweet
malt
and
medicinal
qualities
taste
is
very
medicinal
cloying
and
barleywinelike
initially
some
stone
fruit
elements
some
hop
attack
there
on
the
finish
medicinal
note
finally
gives
way
to
a
good
roast
quality
with
lingering
hop
bitterness
the
8
3
alc
by
volume
listed
on
the
label
is
very
evident
contributing
im
sure
to
the
barleywinelike
characterics
of
this
beer
on
a
winters
night
a
good
quaff
but
not
to
be
considered
sessionable
by
any
stretch
it
has
a
more
roast
finish
i
find
than
other
baltic
porters
ive
tried
utenos
liviske
complex
flavor
profile
indeed
would
be
on
my
winter
drinking
list
but
the
quaff
wow
what
a
mixture
of
anise
plums
raisons
and
chocolate
is
this
a
ris
or
a
porter
thick
and
chewy
i
could
sip
these
for
quite
awhile
being
careful
of
the
8
d
it
is
very
tasty
i
am
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
would
buy
though
i
think
it
is
good
but
at
same
time
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
my
true
style
abv
isnt
much
higher
than
sinebrychoff
but
once
again
i
find
this
affects
me
quite
a
bit
more
i
cant
have
nearly
as
much
of
this
as
id
like
the
okocim
porter
pours
impenetrably
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
as
you
reach
the
bottom
of
your
glass
it
reveals
a
much
less
ominous
reddish
brown
hue
the
smell
is
mostly
that
of
roasted
malt
coffee
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
it
has
moderate
carbonation
and
is
medium
bodied
but
the
mouth
feel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
roasted
malt
that
is
offset
by
alcohol
and
some
hop
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
dark
rum
based
deserts
there
is
noticeable
heat
on
the
semidry
finish
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
intoxicating
but
not
exceptional
example
of
a
baltic
porter
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
given
some
of
the
stellar
reviews
from
other
bas
i
just
wasnt
bowled
over
by
this
beer
its
certainly
a
good
baltic
porter
i
just
dont
think
its
anything
more
than
that
ill
take
a
d
carnegie
or
sinebrychoff
over
the
okocim
any
day
d
unfortunaly
the
alcohol
does
cut
into
the
drinability
a
tad
however
this
is
still
a
very
good
sipper
and
a
beast
of
a
porter
i
enjoyed
just
needs
to
tone
it
down
a
tad
overall
very
nice
though
this
is
a
wonderful
sipping
brew
imo
one
of
the
best
in
style
in
the
world
coming
in
a
very
close
second
to
zywiec
porter
complex
yet
drinkable
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
but
looks
a
little
thin
it
has
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
winey
there
are
also
notes
of
dark
malt
sweet
dark
fruit
like
prunes
and
dates
barley
syrup
the
taste
is
similar
with
soft
notes
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
tossed
into
the
equation
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
body
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
means
that
this
one
slips
down
extra
easily
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
well
worth
seeking
out
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
immediately
and
after
a
couple
of
nice
swallows
of
this
beer
you
reallize
it
has
turned
into
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
over
a
long
time
pours
a
dark
brown
with
much
carbonation
and
little
hops
or
malt
aroma
taste
is
roasted
sweetness
with
alcohol
coming
through
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
high
traditional
polish
tastewow
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
of
this
polish
traditional
taste
what
a
pleasure
this
will
be
to
drink
immediately
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
sucks
you
right
in
toffee
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
cappuccino
with
an
underbelly
of
figs
and
raisins
coated
in
sweet
sugar
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
notes
stick
to
the
tongue
and
are
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
fluffy
nestle
chocolate
powder
flavors
slight
bitterness
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
medium
to
full
bodied
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
hint
of
spicy
alcohol
becomes
apparent
as
it
warms
a
very
excellent
porter
especially
for
the
price
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
for
anything
more
more
than
average
drinkability
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
smell
a
little
too
dairy
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
ill
rush
back
to
i
continue
to
be
amazed
my
how
different
each
baltic
porter
is
that
i
try
the
wine
characteristics
of
this
one
really
set
it
apart
definitely
worth
seeking
out
just
dont
grab
okocim
lager
by
mistake
deep
chocolate
colored
body
topped
by
a
longlasting
tan
head
beer
is
very
bright
where
the
light
shines
through
no
haziness
whatsoever
aroma
has
a
nice
sweet
plum
note
flavor
is
impressive
up
front
the
sweetness
hits
me
first
then
some
nice
fruit
and
caramelized
sugars
clean
toasted
malt
flavors
intermingle
perfectly
slightly
smoky
note
as
well
finally
some
herbal
bitterness
comes
through
and
it
persists
well
after
i
swallow
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
especially
given
the
higher
abv
really
a
wonderful
beer
ive
known
about
it
for
years
but
this
is
my
first
experience
with
it
amazing
how
we
sometimes
take
the
commonly
available
splendors
for
granted
sometimes
brew
pours
to
a
black
color
that
is
nearly
opaque
in
appearance
but
does
let
some
red
highlights
through
gas
a
nice
medium
colored
tan
head
that
has
pretty
good
legs
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
over
all
this
is
a
very
good
looking
brew
the
aroma
was
noticeable
right
from
the
poor
with
a
strong
scent
of
alcohol
mixed
with
licorice
and
coffee
as
i
took
a
deeper
smell
i
also
notice
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
maybe
a
sherry
scent
very
complex
smelling
brew
which
is
nice
on
a
cold
snowy
night
the
taste
is
also
very
nice
with
a
sweet
flavor
that
seems
to
dominate
with
brown
sugar
licorice
malts
dark
fruits
and
butterscotch
then
breaks
to
a
roasted
flavor
which
is
somewhat
surprising
as
i
figured
that
it
would
be
more
of
a
burn
flavor
over
all
this
is
a
great
brew
but
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
more
but
it
is
hard
to
specify
what
that
more
is
i
guess
after
hearing
about
this
brew
for
a
number
of
years
and
then
actually
being
able
to
give
it
a
try
it
did
not
live
up
to
all
the
hype
still
a
strong
brew
no
pun
in
my
book
dark
malts
are
simple
but
very
effective
as
the
backbone
flavor
with
some
light
fruitiness
and
a
slight
smokiness
in
the
finish
wonderfully
free
of
alcohol
notes
finish
is
dry
and
balanced
and
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
velvety
smooth
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
too
overpowering
or
unbalanced
wow
this
is
really
good
probably
polands
finest
beer
d
porters
arent
my
favorite
because
i
find
their
bitterness
displeasing
but
this
one
is
excellent
taste
is
really
fantastic
good
stuff
all
around
feel
is
stiff
carbonation
dry
bitter
finish
creamy
body
notes
i
knew
this
was
a
highly
respected
beer
going
in
to
this
sampling
but
ive
had
this
many
times
and
every
time
i
come
out
of
it
dissapointed
i
think
this
may
be
my
last
attempt
its
ok
but
there
are
many
many
porters
worthy
of
my
money
compared
to
this
creamy
feminine
and
quite
tasty
again
semi
sweet
chocolate
with
sweet
coating
toffeecaramel
that
intermingle
quite
well
hints
of
dark
fruits
mainly
black
currant
with
a
slight
roast
could
have
benefited
from
the
addition
of
more
hop
balance
still
a
very
solid
easily
drinkable
beer
drinkability
good
its
different
from
every
other
porter
and
even
baltic
porter
ive
had
with
those
marine
and
extremely
subtle
anise
notes
that
said
perhaps
a
bit
overrated
pours
a
nice
dark
brownblack
color
nice
carbonation
nice
tiny
head
which
leaves
some
lacing
the
nose
is
of
sweet
sightly
roasted
malts
toffeecaramel
and
slight
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
sweetmalty
nice
toffeecaramel
taste
theres
a
nice
warming
effect
from
the
higher
abv
in
this
one
medium
body
very
well
rounded
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
porters
for
me
too
date
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
a
very
great
offering
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
enjoyed
with
anything
but
itself
a
definite
must
try
for
anyone
looking
to
try
a
great
beer
aroma
was
of
strong
black
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
mild
espresso
notes
taste
was
almost
like
a
hersheys
chocolate
bar
probably
the
closest
resemblance
to
milk
chocolate
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
there
was
a
decent
black
malt
backbone
to
it
but
chocolate
dominates
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
had
a
pleasant
light
carbonation
that
went
very
well
with
the
chocolate
taste
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
there
was
a
decent
level
of
bitterness
i
must
say
at
just
2
49
for
a
half
liter
bottle
this
a
great
value
for
a
great
beer
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
im
going
to
enjoy
more
every
time
i
drink
it
d
very
interesting
lots
of
big
flavors
make
you
want
to
sip
this
one
over
and
over
deep
black
with
slight
red
hints
and
a
thick
foamy
brown
head
very
nice
aroma
is
sweet
earthy
plums
and
alcohol
with
roasted
malts
taste
is
syrupy
and
sweet
with
malts
and
coffee
flavors
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
slightly
above
average
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
dark
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
looks
like
bloodon
the
the
table
it
looks
more
deep
brown
small
white
head
to
start
that
quickly
leaves
a
bunch
of
lacing
with
some
slight
stickness
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
roastedness
up
front
followed
by
a
little
dark
chocolate
or
coffee
the
taste
is
absolutely
tremendous
sweet
chocolate
roasted
maltiness
and
a
nice
bitter
coffee
finish
if
only
the
mouthfeel
was
little
creamier
this
would
be
heaven
in
a
glass
regardless
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
great
stuff
and
a
perfect
dessert
beer
highest
recommendation
pour
from
500ml
bottle
no
head
has
my
beer
gone
flat
or
is
this
normal
the
smell
is
quite
refreshing
with
a
early
promise
of
bitter
coffee
yet
slightly
raw
the
taste
is
great
a
roasted
bitterness
along
with
a
raw
malt
taste
not
to
mention
the
obvious
roasted
coffee
or
chocolate
notes
the
alcohol
taste
is
conceiled
very
well
in
the
bitter
finish
no
lacing
the
only
downside
i
must
add
is
the
high
degree
of
thin
tasting
sweetness
pretty
rich
so
not
too
drinkable
in
a
way
one
of
my
very
favorite
porters
and
arguably
the
number
one
in
its
class
okocim
have
brewed
an
absolute
belter
of
a
beer
here
and
its
one
im
hoping
ill
be
seeming
on
my
local
bottle
o
shelves
for
a
long
time
to
come
hand
carried
back
from
kansas
city
gomers
its
as
smooth
as
silk
perfectly
suited
as
a
dinner
and
desert
sipper
and
easily
the
best
porter
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
would
pair
perfectly
with
a
hearty
stewed
meal
on
a
cold
winter
night
rich
taste
but
the
sweetness
becomes
prohibitive
in
the
drinkability
i
easily
finished
the
bottle
but
could
not
drink
a
second
one
in
a
row
while
i
usually
cling
to
my
fathers
irish
roots
i
will
admit
to
having
polish
blood
in
me
with
this
beer
in
hand
rich
warming
and
full
bodied
i
can
easily
say
that
this
is
the
best
polish
beer
ive
ever
had
drinkability
is
great
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
i
definitely
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
pours
a
grougeous
dark
ruby
red
with
about
an
inch
of
tight
head
the
head
has
good
retention
and
laces
the
glass
as
it
is
consumed
has
a
sweet
malty
smell
to
it
no
hop
aroma
detected
thick
and
tangy
on
the
tongue
with
a
roasted
taste
as
goes
down
the
palate
cant
quite
figure
the
taste
out
just
nice
and
smooth
would
love
to
replicate
this
one
a
nice
chocolate
flavour
comes
in
this
dark
brew
it
has
ruby
tones
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
on
mine
was
very
thin
and
tan
sounds
like
im
writing
about
a
model
this
one
is
also
sweet
it
would
be
nice
with
a
meal
or
with
vanilla
ice
cream
even
a
fine
beer
but
one
is
enough
due
to
the
sweetness
md
overall
very
smooth
and
flavorful
and
easily
drinkable
well
blended
and
layered
flavors
give
this
porter
a
great
mouthfeel
a
marvelous
beer
i
love
it
ill
be
drinkin
this
bad
boy
again
and
again
and
again
smeels
okay
but
not
really
distinctive
looks
good
though
deep
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
and
good
lace
too
sweet
to
make
a
habit
of
the
flavors
is
rich
and
chocolately
but
buffered
by
balanced
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
rich
brew
yet
lively
theres
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
example
of
what
a
porter
can
be
the
appearance
is
very
nice
with
a
little
head
retention
and
very
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
funky
sweet
with
some
dark
roasted
coffee
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
and
its
a
little
overwhelming
the
taste
is
a
litte
off
with
its
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
having
too
much
of
this
beer
anymore
interesting
the
flavor
is
much
less
complex
than
the
aroma
thankfully
this
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
anticipated
good
carbonation
and
no
lingering
sweetness
as
i
anticipated
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
one
i
will
seek
out
again
thanks
to
dogfood
for
the
recommendation
of
this
tasty
brew
slainte
pours
a
clear
very
dark
redbrown
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
that
never
completely
goes
away
aroma
of
olives
slightly
winey
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
taste
was
a
coffee
front
with
lots
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
warming
alcohol
the
finish
was
bitter
like
raw
cocoa
and
lasted
pretty
long
mouthfeel
was
quite
thick
and
warming
the
high
abv
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
good
dry
porter
and
the
first
baltic
porter
ive
tried
good
stuff
yummy
yummy
yummy
mouthfeel
is
mildly
grainy
with
lingering
of
cocoa
and
sweet
cola
on
the
tongue
weird
that
hopdog
also
got
the
cola
thing
as
well
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
big
beer
rich
and
full
bodied
but
would
make
a
tasty
slow
paced
decadent
session
approachable
yet
complex
ill
be
enjoying
this
one
again
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
chocolatey
with
some
roast
for
good
measure
very
chocolatey
flavor
with
some
dried
dark
fruits
lingering
bitterness
and
alcohol
very
rich
and
full
bodied
lush
on
the
tongue
this
is
good
stuff
poured
out
black
but
looked
more
dark
brown
when
held
to
light
had
a
beige
colored
head
left
some
good
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
was
sweet
maybe
had
some
chocolate
and
a
slight
roastiness
but
it
seemed
a
bit
weak
taste
starts
of
with
mostly
caramel
and
a
touch
of
toffee
a
little
bit
roasty
before
the
finish
then
the
sweet
caramel
comes
back
to
join
in
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
this
was
certainly
different
than
i
was
expecting
but
was
still
enjoyable
the
place
i
got
the
bottle
didnt
seem
to
have
very
good
conditions
so
maybe
this
one
is
even
better
when
taken
care
of
pretty
good
poured
a
deep
brown
with
hints
of
red
along
the
glass
with
a
beige
colored
head
about
an
inch
high
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
a
fragrant
sweet
aroma
hits
the
nose
with
coffee
chocolate
and
malt
then
a
dried
fruit
scent
comes
through
much
like
currants
or
raisons
very
surprising
the
malt
dominates
the
flavor
almost
till
the
end
when
that
surprise
of
aroma
comes
foward
a
dried
fruit
flavor
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
taste
a
rich
mouthfeel
it
coats
the
palate
nicely
till
the
burning
sensation
of
alchol
hits
the
throat
still
this
fairly
easy
to
drink
beer
very
surprising
in
taste
and
aroma
for
a
porter
this
beer
should
be
treated
as
it
were
a
imperial
stout
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
the
complexity
that
it
brings
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
quite
different
from
a
more
traditional
british
or
american
porter
and
not
in
a
bad
way
i
live
in
near
a
small
polish
enclave
here
in
brooklyn
and
polish
beer
is
very
cheap
so
i
will
likely
be
picking
this
up
again
recommended
theres
tons
of
this
beer
along
with
just
about
every
other
polish
brew
imported
to
the
states
in
the
vast
eastern
european
section
at
liquor
depot
in
new
britain
ct
deep
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
with
some
frothy
tan
head
dark
quite
dark
smells
allllmost
sickeningly
sweet
and
malty
dark
fruits
come
to
mind
taste
is
nice
but
potent
raisins
coffee
maltyness
all
come
to
mind
the
first
few
sips
are
quite
nice
but
it
quicky
becomes
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
overall
id
like
to
have
a
tiny
sample
of
this
with
or
after
dessert
but
the
whole
bottle
id
never
get
through
id
rather
have
the
finnish
porter
in
the
top
10
there
are
meatier
ballsier
examples
of
the
style
in
my
experience
but
this
is
good
stuff
drinkability
for
the
most
part
this
beer
was
all
alcohol
and
sugar
finishing
the
500ml
bottle
was
a
hardwon
battle
an
appallingly
syrupy
beer
with
no
redeeming
qualities
i
much
preferred
the
sinebrychoff
porter
and
duckrabbits
baltic
porter
over
this
mess
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
the
main
aroma
i
smell
is
caramel
and
theres
also
some
dark
fruit
molasses
and
chocolate
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
except
with
a
bit
ofnoticable
alcohol
in
the
taste
it
starts
out
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
also
as
it
warms
i
can
taste
some
licorice
too
the
taste
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
a
little
bit
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
its
also
creamy
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
too
even
with
the
high
abv
i
should
have
bought
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
overall
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
notes
simply
fantastic
very
few
beers
have
a
mouthfeel
as
heavenly
as
this
so
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
this
will
become
another
regular
in
my
home
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
consists
of
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
with
dark
fruit
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
to
it
this
is
a
big
malty
baltic
porter
vinous
through
and
through
chocolate
and
coffee
emerge
behind
the
fruitiness
of
it
all
finish
leans
toward
the
dry
side
with
anise
in
the
background
this
is
more
of
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
its
something
nice
to
warm
you
during
the
cold
winter
months
but
i
see
this
more
as
a
night
cap
due
to
its
hefty
body
and
higher
alcohol
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
ive
been
waiting
a
while
to
try
this
baltic
porter
and
was
finally
able
to
bring
it
home
with
me
poured
a
gorgeous
deep
translucent
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
creamy
foam
smells
of
molasses
dark
brown
sugar
alcohol
licorice
taste
is
sweet
at
first
theres
that
molasses
again
followed
by
black
plum
sugary
malt
and
mocha
alcohol
is
present
but
in
a
good
way
medium
mouthfeel
with
carbonation
lingering
between
light
to
medium
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
least
bit
i
look
forward
to
trying
okocims
other
offerings
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
cremecolored
head
it
smells
of
chocolate
liqueur
and
port
with
a
hint
of
cherry
overall
okocim
feels
quite
sweet
featuring
tastes
of
cocoa
toffee
roasted
grain
and
wild
fruit
with
an
undertone
of
dry
coffee
a
smooth
drink
it
has
a
bit
of
acidity
and
minimal
bitterness
creating
an
experience
more
like
a
lightly
carbonated
red
wine
than
beer
d
a
bit
sweet
to
be
able
to
drink
several
of
these
but
a
great
porter
none
the
less
i
tried
this
beer
after
a
good
recommendation
from
a
polish
collaborator
of
mine
i
now
consider
him
more
of
a
friend
because
of
this
beer
way
to
go
lukasz
pours
very
nice
and
creamylooking
with
a
solidlooking
head
very
dark
brown
body
looks
great
odor
is
all
roasted
malts
a
little
chocolate
maybe
a
bit
of
fruitiness
taste
really
is
fanstastic
tried
it
two
days
after
having
some
baltika
6
porter
and
this
blows
it
out
of
the
water
very
chocolately
slightly
burnt
and
bitter
nice
hops
which
are
mostly
noticeable
during
the
requisite
burps
creamy
milky
foamy
mouthfeel
perfect
for
the
style
and
almost
stoutlike
goes
down
very
easlily
despite
the
high
abv
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
baltic
porters
or
maybe
just
more
of
this
one
d
watch
out
this
does
not
drink
like
an
8
abv
beer
its
sweet
its
creamy
its
big
on
flavor
and
sneaks
up
on
you
this
is
a
really
approachable
friendly
comforting
beer
ill
be
getting
this
again
this
winter
for
sure
d
very
good
it
is
the
first
and
only
for
now
baltic
porter
that
ive
sampled
but
im
impressed
great
sweet
taste
very
creamy
and
balanced
nice
carbonation
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
for
the
high
alcohol
and
robust
flavor
i
could
see
myself
drinking
alot
of
this
if
i
lived
in
poland
overall
impression
a
wonderful
porter
a
world
class
beer
this
would
be
a
regular
for
me
if
i
could
find
it
around
town
no
alcoholic
harshness
at
all
despite
the
8
abv
strongly
recommended
this
is
a
particularly
rich
baltic
porter
very
dark
dense
and
well
crafted
good
baltic
porter
a
style
i
like
a
lot
not
my
favorite
from
what
ive
tried
but
well
crafted
very
sweet
and
probably
and
ideal
chocolate
cake
dessert
beer
i
wasnt
quiet
expecting
the
intensity
so
im
a
bit
ill
prepared
for
the
onslaught
of
flavour
and
alcohol
in
this
next
time
ill
limber
up
beforehand
with
a
rochefort
10
or
something
wow
this
is
one
spectacular
beer
not
a
session
porter
but
a
good
beer
to
finish
a
night
off
with
2
99
for
a
500ml
what
a
steal
still
a
good
brew
this
brew
is
very
complex
in
aroma
and
flavor
rewarding
the
alcohol
is
8
3
abv
but
it
is
very
well
hidden
i
feel
it
but
the
etoh
smell
and
taste
are
barely
noticeable
i
would
recommend
this
offering
notes
what
a
great
suprise
and
treat
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
been
really
happy
with
a
non
american
beer
maybe
just
cause
we
get
them
so
fresh
over
here
i
find
a
lot
of
the
good
over
seas
products
to
finish
with
that
trash
flavor
that
ruins
an
otherwise
great
beer
lots
of
the
sammy
smith
products
i
purchase
are
just
ruined
clear
bottle
shipped
stored
and
its
a
porter
and
i
dont
hate
it
i
even
really
like
it
top
10
or
even
20
no
way
but
its
good
and
different
and
i
am
happy
i
would
call
it
a
must
try
it
if
you
can
beer
good
call
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
very
wellconstructed
and
tasty
brew
d
not
very
drinkable
more
owing
to
the
style
than
to
the
beer
itself
d
very
tasty
not
as
filling
as
most
beers
in
this
genre
and
although
there
is
some
alcohol
sting
in
the
taste
it
does
not
feel
like
it
has
an
8
30
abv
as
listed
on
the
bottle
i
had
intended
to
drink
this
beer
slowly
thinking
that
it
was
a
sipper
but
i
found
myself
drinking
it
very
quickly

nice

this
is

drinkable
at
over
8
abv
this
is
definitely
the
best
regular
porter
i
have
had
so
far
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
d
this
porter
is
a
winner
seriously
delicious
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
that
is
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
first
time
i
held
this
up
to
my
nose
all
i
could
say
was
wow
aroma
is
sweet
roasted
malt
caramel
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
absolutely
delicious
starts
out
sweet
and
finishes
roasty
with
many
of
the
same
flavors
as
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
delightfully
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
fine
brew
that
is
definitely
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
porters
d
a
beer
to
savor
and
to
seek
out
great
alone
or
i
would
think
paired
with
dessert
maybe
even
meat
bbq
ill
give
it
a
strong
recommendation
packs
a
wallop
in
both
taste
and
strength
if
you
love
malty
strong
sweet
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
as
i
mentioned
above
this
is
the
first
perfect
5
rating
ive
ever
given
a
beer
and
this
one
truly
deserves
it
wow
what
a
beer
body
is
quite
big
with
a
soft
as
velvet
texture
and
creamy
slippery
mouthfeel
warming
and
dangerously
drinkable
seek
one
out
smooth
and
creamy
warm
roasted
and
a
little
sweet
my
fiance
likes
to
microwave
her
softbaked
chocolate
chunk
dark
chocolate
brownies
and
this
strikes
me
as
a
similar
experience
this
beer
is
forcing
me
to
eat
because
the
bottle
says
8
3
alc
vol
and
i
need
another
one
note
my
bottle
says
8
3abv
vs
the
8
1
on
ba
a
recipe
alteration
perhaps
give
me
sinebrychoff
any
day
d
very
drinkable
easilly
drink
two
a
night
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
favorite
porter
ill
definitely
have
this
one
again
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
nearly
black
with
a
1
finger
light
tan
head
that
hung
around
aroma
was
malty
and
chocolatey
with
hints
of
coffee
taste
was
of
espresso
coffee
chocolate
ripe
fruit
and
licorice
hop
bitterness
was
barely
present
the
finish
was
sweet
with
a
pleasing
alcoholic
warmth
at
the
end
of
each
swallow
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
creamy
drinkability
is
good
if
you
like
a
robust
beer
this
is
damn
good
and
not
a
beer
for
wimps
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
a
bargain
at

i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
great
porter
close
to
best
of
show
for
the
tasting
then
i
started
drinking
the
belgian
beer
oppps
good
mouthfeel
though
a
bit
thicker
than
other
baltics
i
have
had
fairly
creamy
really
okay
drinkability
in
my
book
this
seems
like
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
it
has
some
high
points
but
the
flavor
doesnt
suit
me
this
beer
really
improves
as
it
warms
a
cornucopia
of
flavors
boarding
on
aged
belgian
dark
ale
but
still
completely
retaining
its
porter
quality
pretty
damn
good
beer
every
bottle
of
this
ive
had
show
abv
at
8
3
d
for
an
abv
of
eight
and
change
this
is
one
deceptively
drinkable
beer
i
will
happily
finish
this
glass
quicker
than
i
should
for
8
3
i
can
see
this
becoming
an
addiction
as
the
polish
say
na
zdrowie
pronounced
nastrovia
it
means
heres
to
your
health
this
is
a
great
porter
overall
almost
kind
of
seems
like
an
imperial
once
its
all
said
and
done
and
it
is
in
the
8
range
so
watch
out
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
overall
thanks
to
the
wife
for
tipping
me
off
on
this
one
she
was
right
good
thing
i
have
located
a
source
for
this
one
in
ma
it
will
be
purchased
many
more
times
in
the
near
future
overall
this
is
a
winner
i
am
going
to
compare
it
to
heavyweights
perkunos
hammer
because
that
was
my
favorite
porter
before
this
one
this
one
is
as
tasty
an
cheaper
plus
it
isnt
disappearing
because
browar
okocim
has
definitely
not
gone
out
of
business
it
is
amazingly
tasty
and
equally
drinkable
id
love
to
drink
this
on
draft
what
a
great
nightcap
i
suppose
this
beer
would
work
well
with
fresh
fruit
and
creamy
cheese
id
love
to
travel
back
in
time
and
try
this
beer
about
ten
years
ago
i
wonder
how
much
better
it
was
then
maybe
it
is
the
same
i
guess
it
really
doesnt
matter
because
this
is
one
ass
kicking
beer
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
kansas
city
mo
i
hope
to
drink
this
again
soon
worthy
of
its
praise
imo
purchased
in
a
halflitre
bottle
for
around
2
poured
a
darkbrown
color
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
little
visibility
and
good
lacing
smell
was
very
deep
roast
malt
accompanied
by
nut
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
a
good
and
complex
aroma
the
taste
was
mostly
malty
robust
and
sweet
a
very
rich
initial
taste
is
followed
by
a
nice
sweetnessmostly
chocolateand
coffeelike
presence
bold
and
flavorful
in
the
mouth
okocim
porter
is
full
carbonated
and
biting
as
it
warms
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
notable
but
not
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
very
good
porter
more
bitter
than
most
but
quite
tasty
and
impressive
dangerously
drinkable
for
such
a
potent
and
high
abv
brew
very
drinkable
but
definitely
a
sipping
rather
than
quaffing
beer
the
alcohol
can
sneak
up
on
you
not
for
the
uninitiated
true
classic
this
is
everything
a
baltic
porter
should
be
complex
challenging
and
inviting
excellent
drinkability
as
a
sipper
pitch
black
with
muted
brown
around
the
edges
one
finger
ugly
foaming
bubbly
head
aroma
is
mild
of
faint
alcohol
given
the
8
3
light
german
hops
and
lager
aromas
nothing
too
intense
good
stuff
here
taste
is
true
to
style
and
is
german
doppleschwarz
like
sweet
caramel
flavor
mostly
with
a
distinct
roasted
malt
note
that
is
delayed
and
swells
on
the
palate
into
the
finish
when
the
sweetness
fades
alcohol
is
there
but
not
flashy
hops
are
minimal
in
taste
too
sweet
in
the
dopplebock
way
for
me
to
really
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
on
the
tounge
but
on
the
mediumhigh
side
as
for
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
for
me
why
bother
with
other
more
flavorful
options
and
styles
particularly
less
boozy
ones
this
is
tame
in
taste
though
good
that
little
roasted
note
saves
it
from
being
booring
drinking
this
made
me
wonder
if
it
is
more
highly
rated
due
to
it
being
fairly
tame
and
for
how
well
it
hides
its
dizzying
alcohol
content
this
is
just
not
for
me
maybe
not
as
rich
as
it
used
to
be
because
we
had
no
trouble
pounding
down
a
couple
pints
drinkability
this
porter
is
quite
drinkable
with
the
malts
and
yeast
making
for
a
smooth
drink
pours
very
dark
maroon
with
ruby
amber
highlights
creamy
biege
head
of
three
fingers
good
retention
and
a
nice
coating
of
sticky
lace
roasted
and
vinous
aromas
dominate
the
nose
with
english
hops
soy
sauce
and
chocolate
malt
in
the
background
articial
sweetener
flavor
upfront
is
probably
the
only
flaw
rich
with
malt
flavor
like
crystal
sweetness
roasted
notes
faint
coffee
and
suspect
stale
dark
malts
drying
herbal
hop
aftertaste
balances
the
flavor
very
well
and
lifts
some
of
the
residual
sweetness
to
form
a
marvelous
execution
of
the
style
medium
in
body
and
a
midlevel
carbonation
allow
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
ample
crispness
finishes
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
a
touch
of
dry
fuggle
hops
and
a
trace
of
alcohol
very
drinkable
considering
the
alcoholic
strength
and
robust
malt
profile
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
mellow
and
smooth
the
beer
is
just
shy
of
medium
bodied
i
wish
the
beer
had
been
a
bit
fuller
on
the
body
perhaps
a
bit
of
oilyness
on
the
mouthfeel
would
have
improved
the
beer
the
beer
is
a
dam
fine
beer
drink
this
beer
is
extremly
drinkable
it
was
a
pleasure
to
smell
and
taste
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
covered
up
in
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
if
it
wasnt
for
the
buzzing
warming
alcohol
i
wouldnt
know
this
was
8
this
beer
should
be
lightly
chilled
for
best
drinking
i
will
buy
this
beer
any
time
i
see
it
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
very
dark
rich
brown
color
completely
opaque
only
a
slight
glint
of
light
comes
through
as
a
mahogany
speck
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
a
rich
creamy
mocha
color
about
a
fingers
width
it
maintains
a
good
lace
smell
is
quite
intense
with
roasted
malt
fig
and
licorice
well
blended
taste
follows
up
the
smell
accurately
moderately
sweet
with
an
unusual
bitterness
i
am
used
to
american
porters
that
can
have
a
coffee
or
chocolate
taste
this
is
quite
different
and
pleasant
licorice
seems
to
be
dominant
but
there
are
some
other
floral
and
herbal
notes
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
creamy
this
is
a
very
pleasant
porter
and
a
real
value
too
i
am
able
to
get
these
for
less
than
2
seems
a
bit
of
a
steal
i
will
definately
be
getting
this
again
major
improvement
over
okocim
beer
a
welldone
robust
dominating
porter
one
or
two
would
be
it
for
me
but
i
think
thats
how
its
meant
to
be
with
this
one
great
beer
recommended
slick
mouthfeel
carbonation
not
evident
in
the
mouth
the
it
is
there
drinkable
but
served
best
as
an
afterdinner
dessert
beer
the
alcohol
can
creep
up
on
you
i
like
sinebrychoff
a
bit
better
but
this
is
still
very
good
bigger
serving
size
i
wont
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
drink
again
but
id
save
it
for
the
fallwinter
nights
when
id
be
more
in
the
mood
for
this
style
would
be
great
with
a
cigar
too
taste
oh
its
been
years
since
ive
had
one
of
these
and
i
remember
liking
it
well
but
this
particular
character
disappeared
from
my
cognizance
amazing
stuff
tastes
like
an
imperial
stout
in
many
ways
so
thick
rich
roasted
toasted
and
buzzing
with
dark
delicious
flavor
sits
very
hard
upon
the
palate
becomes
firmly
ensconced
in
the
senses
some
hoppiness
at
first
but
afterwards
dominated
by
sweet
raisiny
rummy
maltiness
and
the
definite
feel
of
alcohol
a
mere
8
1
this
ill
recommend
this
to
everyone
it
was
pretty
cheap
but
apparently
not
widely
distributed
now
that
i
can
recognize
the
bottle
ill
be
looking
for
it
mouthfeel
a
nice
silky
profile
coats
the
tongue
nicely
and
went
very
well
with
my
ikea
swedish
meatballs
with
a
lemon
pepper
salal
dressing
this
beer
has
rich
flavors
but
allows
them
to
be
washed
away
to
be
enjoyed
with
other
flavors
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
has
a
beautiful
chocolate
color
with
an
awsome
tan
head
smell
of
nuts
chocolate
and
fig
are
present
has
a
very
smooth
cahracter
when
you
taste
it
seems
to
age
pretty
well
my
dad
and
i
had
a
bottle
that
was
a
year
old
and
it
was
excellent
8
1
abv
is
nice
and
it
finishes
well
awsome
job
poland
overall
comments
will
certainly
buy
this
again
okocim
definitely
stands
out
among
most
european
balticimperial
porters
as
a
oneofakind
but
probably
wont
be
drinking
too
many
of
these
over
the
summer
500
ml
bottle
8
3
abv
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
russet
highlights
and
a
dense
beige
head
nose
is
an
overthetop
vinous
affair
with
dark
fruits
like
plums
bing
cherries
and
prunes
reconstituted
with
port
a
roasted
chocolate
aroma
is
detectable
as
well
big
flavors
of
cherries
and
plums
with
a
mineral
twinge
at
the
finish
sweet
dark
fruits
linger
in
the
aftertaste
molasses
and
currants
some
roasted
malt
bitterness
provides
a
subtle
bulwark
against
oversweetness
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
which
is
certainly
full
for
a
porter
but
overall
closer
to
mediumbodied
and
quite
smooth
with
some
very
slight
alcohol
warming
okocim
porter
reminds
me
quite
a
lot
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
although
i
like
my
stouts
to
lean
more
toward
the
roasty
side
of
things
rather
than
darkly
sweet
not
sure
when
this
one
was
brewedbottled
but
i
believe
i
prefer
baltic
porters
with
a
bit
of
age
on
them
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
but
not
quite
my
favorite
rich
sweet
and
raisiny
taste
finishes
like
a
sweet
port
or
sherry
rich
velvety
mouthfeel
despite
a
mediumhigh
prickly
carbonation
a
damn
good
beer
a
very
complex
beer
that
saves
european
porters
from
the
dismal
abyss
of
american
marcos
d
goes
in
and
down
very
easily
warranted
though
a
16
9oz
bottle
at
8
3
has
the
ability
to
sneak
up
on
you
hindsight
is
2020
however
when
a
beer
much
less
a
porter
is
this
easy
to
drink
a
completely
enjoyable
beer
is
about
all
you
really
have
to
say
about
this
one
it
is
very
highly
rated
for
good
reason
the
only
reason
you
might
not
like
this
one
is
that
is
on
the
sweet
side
if
you
hate
sweeter
beers
then
this
probably
isnt
something
you
will
like
because
of
the
sweetness
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
have
more
than
one
bottle
hence
the
drinkability
suffers
however
it
still
stands
as
a
very
unique
and
delicious
porter
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
a
slight
tan
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malt
molasses
and
alcohol
the
flavor
starts
off
with
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
molasses
toasted
bread
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
appropriate
for
the
style
and
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
baltic
porter
but
seems
one
dimensional
to
me
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
not
that
i
didnt
expect
to
enjoy
it
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
very
very
good
porter
probably
the
best
that
i
have
had
to
date
perfect
dark
mahogany
body
plenty
of
bubbly
huge
frothy
tan
head
retention
is
good
with
a
medium
ring
vinous
aromas
of
burnt
fig
prunes
raisons
nuts
licorice
and
mocha
coffee
warming
alcohol
borders
on
intrusive
i
would
say
one
needs
to
be
in
the
mood
for
strength
to
enjoy
this
one
the
8
1
is
only
partially
covered
flavors
are
all
burnt
fruit
with
an
almost
peaty
scotch
ale
like
sensation
drinkable
considering
the
strength
and
very
affordable
d
i
wish
that
i
had
had
this
beer
before
reviewing
the
other
baltic
porters
under
my
belt
so
far
as
it
seems
that
this
could
be
the
standard
a
bit
to
sweet
for
this
to
be
a
session
beer
or
one
that
i
would
like
to
drink
regularly
but
at
1
82
a
bottle
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
d
too
sweet
to
be
excellent
in
the
drinkability
category
definately
not
a
session
beer
this
stuff
has
changed
since
my
last
review
still
pours
a
brownruby
hue
with
a
lasting
tan
head
the
aroma
is
great
coffee
chocolate
notable
bright
hops
burned
toast
this
stuff
is
pretty
sweet
in
the
mouth
but
is
otherwise
well
balanced
with
hops
and
thick
coffee
rich
chocolate
caramel
also
noted
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
comes
through
more
towards
the
end
this
is
an
extremely
smooth
and
delicious
brew
i
am
a
big
fan
of
zywiec
porter
and
this
is
similar
but
not
as
harsh
it
pours
a
very
darka
amber
with
a
pillow
head
and
very
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
malty
with
hop
undertones
you
can
note
the
smoothness
that
is
to
follow
the
taste
maintains
a
maltiness
throughout
with
a
hint
of
hops
underneath
to
provide
a
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
smooth
almost
creamy
this
brew
is
best
in
teh
drinkability
area
it
is
smoooth
the
8
1
abv
doesnt
get
up
and
hit
you
either
outstanding
a
must
try
for
baltic
porter
fans
nearly
opaque
black
color
with
a
white
and
quickly
diminishing
white
head
moderate
burnt
currant
and
roast
aroma
with
a
light
hint
of
smoke
and
coffee
i
found
the
flavor
overwhelmingly
cloying
and
i
usually
dont
enjoy
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
in
stoutsporters
but
the
additions
here
could
have
been
more
substancial
i
found
it
pretty
timid
overall
with
a
fairly
light
body
and
light
raisin
coffee
roast
flavors
not
really
enjoyable
and
a
bit
hard
to
finish
i
really
like
sweet
beers
but
this
is
over
the
top
with
sugar
half
liter
bottle
list
as

abv
pours
a
deep
cola
color
with
a
light
brown
colored

and
stickage
aromas
of
caramel
malts

hearty

and
a
slight
hint
of
star

solid
baltic

qualities
all
around
roasty
hearty
chewy
a
touch
sweet
but
has
a
decent
dryness
in
the
finish
that
keeps
it
nice
and
easydrinking
slick
on
the
tongue
hopping
is
mild
as
with
a
lot
of
polish
beer
they
like
the
low
alpha
hops
good
beer
the
smell
is
amazing
chocolate
dark
malt
maple
syrup
caramel
and
all
kinds
of
other
gewy
substances
poured
a
nice
solid
dark
cream
colored
head
that
held
strong
and
as
time
went
on
reminded
me
of
nitro
stouts
opaque
black
beer
with
a
faint
copper
hue
around
the
edges
left
sheets
of
lace
as
it
was
consumed
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
smothers
my
tongue
with
flavor
charred
malt
up
front
creamy
flavors
vanilla
mix
with
cocoa
in
the
middle
there
was
a
slight
metallic
flavor
at
first
but
after
a
few
sips
its
gone
the
sweetness
really
kicks
in
towards
the
end
and
holds
well
into
the
finish
allowed
in
a
faint
bitterness
an
amazing
beer
in
many
aspects
but
it
tastes
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
interested
this
dark
brown
nearly
black
liquid
has
a
beautiful
reddish
hue
and
a
creamy
dense
head
what
an
aroma
lots
of
highly
roasted
malt
theres
a
solid
blackpatent
smell
thats
the
centerpiece
of
the
nose
surrounded
by
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
sweetsmelling
malt
and
a
fleeting
fruitiness
the
taste
is
first
classa
lot
of
burnt
and
roasted
character
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
its
a
little
drier
than
the
aroma
lets
on
but
its
full
and
very
creamy
i
love
the
complexity
of
the
specialty
grains
in
this
one
again
its
full
and
satisfying
moderately
low
carbonation
hides
its
abv
very
well
simply
solid
and
very
enjoyable
notes
my
first
baltic
porter
and
wow
this
would
be
a
great
end
to
a
meal
or
any
night
delicious
beer
btw
this
beers
website
is
extremely
interactive
you
should
go
there
drinkability
this
beer
was
truly
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
love
how
the
taste
goes
from
a
nice
bitterness
to
a
full
on
sugary
and
creamy
chocolate
taste
and
then
fills
your
mouth
with
espesso
this
beer
is
truly
amazing
had
a
real
hard
time
not
giving
this
ones
5s
across
the
board
highest
recommendation
here
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
tan
head
from
a
half
liter
brown
bottle
aroma
at
first
seemed
a
bit
estery
now
it
is
more
like
molasses
flavor
definitely
has
roasted
malt
chocolate
is
a
minor
note
a
hint
of
sawdust
if
that
makes
any
sense
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
well
worth
trying
definitely
recommended
thanks
to
bigern
for
the
trade
fairly
dark
black
in
color
the
light
only
creates
slight
red
hues
around
the
edges
a
short
tan
head
covers
the
top
like
a
crust
and
it
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smell
is
not
particularly
strong
but
yields
hints
of
a
nutty
chocolate
aroma
taste
starts
out
a
bit
hoppyspicy
and
becomes
very
sweet
a
very
strong
chocolatey
flavor
not
as
bitter
as
some
porters
the
alcohol
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
is
labeled
the
mouthfeel
is
great
thick
perfect
carbonation
coats
well
i
enjoyed
this
brew
immensely
it
might
be
just
a
tad
too
sweet
to
be
perfect
but
its
still
a
great
flavor
i
recommend
it
hopefully
some
of
my
local
shops
will
pick
this
up
i
liiike
d
well
i
cant
session
it
and
it
is
too
sweet
for
food
im
not
going
to
hunt
it
down
in
the
future
either
finishing
one
is
not
difficult
but
it
is
a
bit
of
a
chore
with
the
blood
and
drying
character
i
guess
that
it
is
sub
par
in
this
category
i
heard
a
rumour
true
or
not
that
the
lcbo
in
ontario
will
no
longer
be
stocking
this
so
i
went
and
bought
a
bunch
more
while
i
was
there
some
other
guy
was
clearing
out
the
entire
stock
guess
im
not
the
only
paranoid
one
edit
may
29
2006
i
had
to
give
1
of
my
2
remaining
bottles
a
try
and
i
have
to
say
the
flavour
has
evolved
enough
to
make
a
difference
i
note
a
more
sweetish
malt
with
anise
tones
and
the
body
is
bordering
on
syrupy
aging
is
doing
fine
so
ill
keep
my
last
bottle
for
say
the
end
of
the
year
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
1
brown
head
over
the
barely
translucent
dark
brown
with
burgundy
highlights
brew
frothy
head
lasts
well
with
ample
dark
lacing
aroma
is
hearty
sweet
dark
grains
with
hints
of
alcohol
taste
is
the
ideal
combination
of
dark
malt
sweetness
and
seductive
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
also
very
nice
this
one
has
been
worth
the
wait
to
find
hopefully
ill
be
revisiting
it
soon
rich
raisin
and
chocolate
aroma
dominate
deep
black
in
color
with
a
beautiful
three
finger
thick
mocha
head
lots
of
roasted
malt
raisin
and
chocolate
through
all
flavor
ranges
pleasing
creamy
mouthfeel
good
lacing
and
the
carbonation
level
is
spot
on
excellent
brew
really
easy
drinking
in
spite
of
the
8
abv
this
rivals
storm
king
for
a
dark
sipping
brew
i
would
love
to
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
with
sinebrychoff
porter
even
without
doing
so
its
obvious
that
this
beer
is
at
least
that
beers
equal
okocim
porter
is
worldclass
and
was
a
pleasure
to
consume
one
of
the
greats
without
question
this
survived
the
crossing
and
thrived
at
2
20
a
bottle
ill
be
hoarding
super
drinkable
for
its
strength
this
was
the
closet
ive
came
to
giving
as
a
ba
nuff
said
in
comparision
to
the
sinebrychoff
i
much
prefer
this
one
it
may
be
have
a
little
more
alcohol
but
i
find
it
much
more
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
rich
creamy
and
chewy
this
does
not
fail
to
please
spot
on
for
a
porter
in
my
mind
the
500ml
bottle
disappears
almost
as
quickly
as
its
poured
into
my
glass
dangerously
drinkable
at
8
3
this
one
is
well
worth
exploring
im
interested
to
see
how
the
other
3
bottles
i
have
do
with
some
aging
thank
you
okocim
for
bringing
this
one
back
to
the
states
poured
into
1
5
liter

a
real
dar

held

wise
french
roast
coffee
and
unsweetened
bitter
chocolate
dominate
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
not
strongflavors
start
out
somewhat
sweet
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
upfront
with
a
very
nice
drying
earthy
slightly
medicinal
finish
a
polish
beer
worthy
of
high
status
complex
and
flavorful
it
might
go
well
with
my
moms
duck
soup
an
absolutely
stellar
beer
even
more
so
during
the
cold
chicago
winter
thanks
to
luckysevens82
for
the
500
ml
bottle
i
kinda
expected
this
beer
to
be
in
your
face
and
slightly
crude
but
instead
this
is
one
of
the
most
refined
big
porters
i
have
tasted
black
as
night
with
a
roasty
coffee
nose
the
first
taste
is
almost
underwhelming
in
its
approach
the
cool
thing
is
that
the
coffee
and
complex
malt
notes
build
up
on
the
finish
until
you
sense
the
lurking
bigness
of
this
beer
very
good
very
refined
and
way
too
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
this
was
one
of
the
beers
that
proved
to
me
that
i
could
like
porters
i
now
buy
this
once
or
twice
a
month
i
can
now
thank
poland
for
something
other
than
pierogies
taste
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
stand
out
at
first
followed
dark
dark
fruits
plums
or
raisins
along
with
just
a
hint
of
toffee
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
and
it
gets
slightly
richer
as
it
gets
warmer
this
is
one
hell
of
good
porter
same
luxurious
rich
chocolate
body
and
the
same
great
mellow
drinkability
that
made
this
porter
famous
in
europe
i
will
be
partaking
again
highly
quaffable
especially
for
an
8
brew
the
only
reason
i
didnt
rate
it
a
5
is
because
of
its
sweetness
nevertheless
far
and
away
the
best
beer
from
this
brewery
and
an
extremely
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
wonderful
brew
i
would
recommend
to
pretty
much
everybody
im
glad
its
back
another
big
thanks
to
northyorksammy
for
the
trade
this
brew
pours
a
solid
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
large
fluffy
tan
and
dissipates
slowly
leaving
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cream
butter
toffee
with
roasted
malt
lying
underneath
the
taste
is
of
toffee
and
cream
with
burnt
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thincker
than
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
difinately
something
to
keep
you
warm
on
a
winters
night
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
porter
with
a
medium
dark
head
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
of
rich
chocolate
with
some
roasted
malt
taste
is
sweeter
then
i
remembered
i
had
this
last
time
about
78
years
ago
with
lots
of
chocolate
flavour
very
little
bitterness
or
hops
are
noticeable
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
rich
creamy
body
make
this
quite
enjoyable
overall
drinkability
absolutely
wonderful
with
none
of
the
phenolic
off
flavors
i
sometimes
get
with
other
baltic
porters
the
lactose
leaves
a
sweet
film
on
your
mouth
and
the
hops
a
slight
prickliness
a
hearty
beer
for
sure
great
with
charred
meat
on
a
cold
day
wow
this
is
good
stuff
pours
an
inky
black
into
my
pint
glass
and
good
lacing
with
a
tightly
compacted
head
aroma
is
slight
cocoa
with
more
coffee
tones
going
on
taste
is
sweetened
coffee
predominately
but
wtih
some
chocolate
notes
included
mouthfeel
could
stand
to
be
thicker
and
less
carbonated
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
pours
a
thick
dark
brownblack
with
a
couple
fingers
of
coffee
brown
head
and
big
black
chunks
of
yeast
settled
at
the
bottom
nose
is
robust
with
toasty
barley
malts
rich
coffee
creamy
dark
chocolate
and
hints
of
anise
and
ripe
dark
fruit
puree
taste
reminded
me
of
a
refined
cross
between
the
baltika
6
porter
and
black
boss
porter
taking
the
grainy
barley
malts
of
the
former
and
the
prune
raisin
fig
and
anise
of
the
latter
with
a
hearty
smattering
of
chocolatey
coffee
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
gets
chunky
with
the
last
few
sips
this
was
a
tasty
baltic
porter
up
there
with
the
sinebrychoff

9
ounce
bottle
at
the

overall
an
exceptional
beer
well
worth
the
hype
that
this
one
gets
i
need
to
make
my
way
back
to
the
store
for
more
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
high
it
was
sugary
sweet
smoky
and
bitter
all
at
the
same
time
additionally
you
had
an
oily
texture
that
went
smooth
and
quick
with
a
tingly
carbonation
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
lately
that
lived
up
to
the
preceding
hype
the
mouthfeel
is
very
viscous
and
oily
with
a
big
body
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier
a
brilliant
sweetness
not
too
overwhelming
but
the
alcohol
can
be
detected
through
a
dryness
over
the
tongue
no
noticeable
hop
bitterness
or
flavor
very
highly
drinkable
for
such
a
robust
high
proof
beer
note

drinkability
and
overall
an
excellent
baltic
porter
the
balance
is
untouchable
and
while
it
tastes
fabulous
i
dont
know
how
many
more
i
could
have
of
these
either
way
this
one
is
quite
hyped
and
its
worth
it
it
was
good
to
find
this
beer
on
the
shelf
again
in
time
for
winter
the
taste
was
a
rush
of
flavors
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
there
very
sweet
malt
flavors
and
a
tartness
as
well
possible
coffee
taste
to
it
was
for
sure
smokey
in
the
aftertaste
and
slightly
tartsour
a
nice
dry
finish
with
a
lingering
sweet
tounge
a
very
creamy
smooth
and
full
flavored
beer
the
milky
foam
of
a
porter
over
a
chocolate
body
is
always
pleasing
this
brew
had
a
sizeable
head
but
it
dissipated
in
under
a
minute
the
odor
promised
chocolate
with
some
fruitiness
and
alcohol
yep
the
label
of
my
500
ml
bottle
says
8
3
abv
there
is
alcohol
in
there
the
butterscotchy
sweet
taste
was
a
little
overwhleming
but
there
were
moments
where
i
got
chocolate
liquor
there
was
little
bitterness
and
the
last
taste
i
detected
was
the
alcohol
the
beer
had
a
nice
body
to
it
creamy
velvet
in
the
mouth
because
of
the
sweetness
im
having
a
tough
time
finishing
this
500
ml
i
like
sweet
beers
but
this
one
is
unbalanced
in
some
way
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
my
fridge
but
if
i
were
given
the
choice
id
pick
another
porter
probably
anchor
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
that
left
lace
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
dense
malt
aroma
the
smell
of
toasted
base
malt
is
intense
giving
the
porter
a
scent
reminiscent
of
barley
wine
there
is
an
underlying
blanket
of
roasted
malt
there
too
like
mild
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
and
roasted
malt
with
balance
coming
from
the
black
malt
bitterness
this
beer
doesnt
give
any
hint
of
8
the
sweetness
in
the
flavor
gives
plenty
of
body
but
the
density
of
the
flavor
goes
beyond
that
with
a
nice
lingering
roasted
chocolate
flavor
this
is
my
first
true
baltic
porter
but
it
will
bring
me
back
for
more
that
is
sure
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
pours
with
a
frothy
light
brown
head
that
sits
atop
an
opaque
black
beer
that
shows
a
brilliantly
clear
brown
when
tipped
and
put
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
concentrated
and
malty
with
notes
of
alcohol
espresso
concentrated
malt
extract
dark
chocolate
and
burnt
raisins
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
up
front
with
a
burnt
roasted
note
throughout
as
well
the
roast
flavors
dont
quite
balance
the
initial
sweetness
though
in
some
ways
it
tastes
like
an
oversweetened
cup
of
espresso
lots
of
sugar
and
bitter
burnt
flavors
it
is
still
tasty
just
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
would
hope
what
is
lacking
here
is
a
thicker
body
this
is
fairly
thin
for
the
style
and
with
the
sweetness
verges
on
becoming
a
bit
cloyingly
thin
what
has
happened
to
this
beer
by
the
way
okocim
has
absolutely
the
coolest
website
of
any
brewery
ive
ever
seen
check
it
out
from
a
500
ml
bottle
dark
cola
brown
near
black
with
a
dense
head
of
chocolate
like
black
foam
aromas
are
all
dark
roasted
patent
malts
a
bit
of
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
and
some
nice
hops
in
the
mix
as
well
taste
is
roasty
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
as
well
as
some
greenish
hops
and
some
nice
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
nice
drinkability
is
damn
good
im
glad
this
is
back
makes
me
proud
to
be
polish
and
at
2
a
500ml
bottle
this
is
a
bargain
as
well
the
drinkablity
of
this
stuff
is
excellent
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
taste
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
other
than
those
little
complaints
very
nice
baltic
porters
always
give
interesting
and
unexpected
flavors
this
one
is
no
different
looks
similar
to
all
other
porters
basicly
black
with
tan
at
the
edges
smells
sweet
and
malty
nearly
molassas
not
as
much
sour
aromas
flavors
open
up
with
bold
sweetness
grape
koolaid
chocolate
barley
light
coffee
toffee
and
a
hint
of
soy
sauce
a
little
acidic
weighs
heavy
on
the
toung
goes
down
smoothly
and
sweetly
sticks
with
you
for
quite
a
while
the
body
is
moderate
and
very
smooth
perfect
for
style
maybe
a
touch
astringent
for
me
but
still
a
classic
example
well
done
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
when
held
to
light
a
finger
of
head
falls
to
a
moderate
covering
over
top
nose
is
very
nice
with
light
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
a
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
base
playing
underneath
it
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
the
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
aroma
the
chocolate
is
imediate
followed
quickly
with
a
light
roasted
coffee
and
fig
the
flavors
are
very
tasty
but
very
smooth
and
not
offensive
at
all
the
feel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
moderate
body
just
awesome
no
hint
anywhere
of
over
8

incredibly
good
all
around
by
far
one
of
the
best
robust
porters
around
very
happy
it
is
back
on
the
shelves
not
a
bad
porter
at
all
just
not
the
valhallainaglass
i
had
heard
it
was
not
bad
for
the
price
as
most
baltic
porters
around
here
tend
to
be
a
little
more
expensive
a
very
good
beer
not
a
great
one
dark
brown
and
nearly
opaque
but
still

held
up
to
the

thick
lacing
and
the
light
brown
head
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
the
roasted
aroma
is
just
short
of
coffee
and
theres
plenty
of
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
moderate
cherry
fruitiness
and
light
alcohol
as
well
low
bitterness
compared
to
the
sweet
and
roasty
malt
cherry
flavour
is
light
and
seems
to
turn
a
bit
acidic
at
the
finish
chocolatey

over
a

theres
a

long
strand
of
curly
lemon
zest
this
is
an
impeccable
beer
its
so
soft
you
could
use
it
as
a
pillow
and
its
got
a
perfect
acidity
to
inspire
interesting
dreams
i
suggest
you
pick
up
a
bunch
of
these
very
reasonably
priced
beers
so
you
can
sleep
fitfully
tonight
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
if
somewhat
sweet
baltic
porter
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
chocolate
complexion
decent
bubbly
head
aromas
are
sweet
chocolatey
taste
is
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
with
chocolate
coffee
some
fruits
present
nice
malt
profile
it
lacks
any
bittering
effect
though
to
counter
the
sweetness
which
reduces
its
drinkability
i
prefer
boom
or
alderis
to
this
one
but
still
a
nice
example
and
worth
trying
bubbles
tingle
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
sparkle
down
the
sides
mouthfeel
is
creamy
upfront
and
becomes
more
viscous
and
flows
through
the
mouth
very
drinkable
awesome
beer
thanks
to
cvschaller
for
sending
this
one
along
i
can
only
hope
that
i
sufficiently
returned
the
favor
poured
a
dark

with
a
large
light
tan
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
roasted

mocha
and
milk
chocolate
aroma
taste
was
that
of
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
some
roasted
malt
and
light
alcohol
in
the
finish
thanks
eda
great
porter
this
goes
down
like
warm
chocolate
deep
and
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
clumpy
tan
head
the
clumps
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
in
a
thick
lace
wonderful
chocolate
nose
it
doesnt
have
the
chocolate
cherry
of
a
double
stout
but
it
is
close
the
finish
has
a
little
espresso
and
just
a
hint
of
orange
nice
mixture
of
chocolate
brandy
cherries
and
espresso
in
the
flavor
definitive
alcohol
warming
but
the
chocolate
stays
true
throughout
the
drink
smooth
slick
mouth
feel
leads
to
a
high
drinakbility
amazing
porter
one
of
the
best
i
will
leave
this
one
to
the
heavyweights
overall
the
variety
of
chocolate
characteristics
are
astounding
more
dimensions
than
i
described
here
and
they
blend
very
well
with
the
other
flavors
this
beer
was
quite
tasty
but
doesnt
have
many
dimensions
other
than
chocolate
i
think
this
beer
will
age
really
well
and
plan
to
pick
up
a
case
of
this
original
rerelease
for
the
long
haul
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
bit
scratchy
at
first
but
it
mellows
just
before
swallowing
not
a
great
session
brew
but
theres
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
make
for
a
good
sipper
drinkability
is
excellent
on
this
beer
i
couldnt
beleive
it
was
as
strong
as
it
was
labeled
never
tasted
hot
or
alcoholy
at
all
pours

malt
balanced
by
caramel
sweetness
nice
mouth
feel
not
too
thin
but
not
too
heavy
cant
quite
place
the
flavor
but
the
roasted
malts
really
come
through
in
the
finish
as
i
drink
and
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
changes
a
bit
i
couldnt
place
the
flavor
at
first
because
it
is
such
a
perfect
blend
of
flavors
that
no
one
flavor
really
stands
out
to
me
some
coffee
nutty
malty
brown
sugar
plays
great
together
defiantly
a
world
class
porter
perfect
for
sitting
by
the
fire

night

i
also
enjoyed

summer
afternoon
drinkability

ive
had
some
killer
porters
over
the
years
but
i
just
cant
remember
having
one
this
refined
and
so
well
put
together
you
almost
need
to
create
a
whole
new
category
for
this
one
d
this
beer
is
complex
yet
has
a
clean
lager
character
to
it
very
nice
beer
and
it
will
be
great
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
malt
and
a
bit
less
sweetness
over
all
but
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
a
gold
metal

black
color
with

said
recently
finished
my
last
one
and
feeling
a
bit
melancholy
the
aromas
and
tastes
in
this
black
beauty
are
so
complex
yet
they
deliver
a
simple
drinking
pleasure
figs

the
quintessential

color
an
occluded

lace
a
glutinous
curtain
to
drape
the

roasted
grain
aroma
with
a
sweet
and
fresh
malt
under
pinning
all
combined
with
hints
of
coffee

chocolate
start
is
ambrosial
and
the
top
thick
and
rich
in
its
feel
on
the

finish
is
spirited
in
its
spiciness
pleasantly
carbonated
bittersweet
chocolate
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
bitterness
to
cap
it
off
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
best
baltic
porter
on
the
market
today
sad
to
say
no
longer
available
here
pours
out
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
a
thick
and
luscious
tan
head
leaving
thick
rings
of

absolutely
decadent

of
rich
thick

tasted
good
thing
i
snagged
a
handfull
of
these
this
one
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
strong
chocolates
coffee
and
some
other
stuff
that
i
didnt
care
much
for
still
decent
and
very
complex
not
being
a
fan
of
the
average
porter
taste
i
didnt
get
too
much
enjoyment
out
of
this
one
ill
give
it
plenty
of
credit
for
being
very
complex
and
interesting
but
the
taste
was
just
not
to
my
liking
it
tastes
like
an
imperial
stout
mixed
with
a
porter
mixed
with
rum
the
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
and
has
a
lot
of
roastedness
in
the
taste
poured
from
a
stoutlooking
16
9
oz
bottle
with
a
goat
on
the
label
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
that
shows
a
little
garnet
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
smell
is
just
amazing
with
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
ripe
fruit
molasses
and
traces
of
caramel
a
torrent
of
flavors
are
also
present
in
addition
to
those
found
in
the
smell
the
taste
tingles
the
tongue
with
just
a
slight
medicinal
taste
that
only
makes
the
whole
thing
more
enjoyable
its
bellywarming
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
almost
encourages
use
of
a
spoon
its
no
session
beer
but
its
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
it
doesnt
quite
match
carnegie
stark
porter
but
its
not
far
off
well
i
was
lucky
to
find
a
couple
of
these
i
only
had
two
ill
wait
for
a
special
occasion
to
drink
the
last
one
pretty
much
lived
up
to
the
expectation
kind
of
an
imperial
porter
strong
fullbodied
extremely
well
balanced
some
bitterness
to
go
with
the
chocolate
flavors
really
a
stout
imo
fits
right
in
with
the
better
stouts
porters
and
doppels
excellent
all
around
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
ordinary
appearance
and
maybe
just
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
i
certainly
would
why
dc
such
an
excellent
beer
the
best
baltic
beer
ive
ever
had
notes
sharing
is
for
the
weak
if
you
find
this
beer
take
it
from
mustard
horde
it
like
the
greedy
pig
that
you
are
the
best
porter
i
have
ever
had
by
far
many
thanks
to
cokes
for
this
extra
gift
in
our
trade
pours
black
ruby
in
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
recedes
nose
is
very
reminiscent
of
kahlua
and
crème
de
cacao
this
is
a
fullbodied
brew
and
is
oh
so
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
taste
is
rich
dark
malts
lots
of
chocolate
syrup
and
dark
fruits
followed
by
some
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
liqueur
and
noticeable
warming
alcohol
an
excellent
choice
for
a
nightcap
and
once
this
gets
30
reviews
its
sure
to
make
the
top
50
list
purchased
from
liquid
solutions
i
remember
hearing
that
this
beer
was
not
being
brewed
anymore
if
thats
true
its
a
sad
day
for
beer
lovers
everywhere
i
have
found
the
beer
of
the
gods
and
its
baltic
porters
beautiful
well
well
what
do
we
have
here
answer
another
exceptional
balticimperial
style
porter
incredible
depth
of
aroma
and
flavor
the
black
and
chocolate
malt
ripe
dark
fruit
plum
prune
raisin
must
be
slowly
savoured
rich
full
bodied
semisweet
with
the
strength
of
8
abv
to
balance
things
out
sit
back
relax
look
smell
taste
repeat
outstanding
the
tan
dense
head
settles
into
a
thin
uniform
layer
that
leaves
sparse
lace
deep
ruby
hue
when
held
to
light
exhibiting
excellent
clarity
assertive
caramelized
sugar
deeply
roasted
malt
dark
toffee
in
aroma
w
a
candied
fruitiness
emerging
at
the
end
as
the
beer
warms
a
touch
of
heaty
fusel
alcohols
add
additional
complexity
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
tremendously
smooth
and
rich
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
there
isnt
the
slightest
hint
of
astringency
to
be
found
the
date
like
malt
sweetness
overpowers
the
understated
hop
bitterness
and
is
thus
quite
high
but
isnt
cloying
full
bodied
but
not
overly
rich
the
finish
is
sweet
lightly
roasty
and
a
touch
fruity
this
is
one
tremendously
flavorful
brew
the
myriad
of
flavors
hide
the
high
relative
alcohol
content
delicious
consider
me
a
convert
to
the
church
of
the
baltic
porter
this
is
gooooooood
stuff
an
absolute
classic
ive
been
intrigued
by
the
baltic
porter
category
for
some
time
and
am
truly
glad
i
am
getting
the
chance
to
finally
try
one
its
hard
to
rate
this
beer
against
other
baltic
porters
since
this
is
the
first
ive
tried
but
that
hardly
matters
this
is
a
terrific
beer
regardless
of
category
almost
pitch
black
though
if
you
look
closely
through
the
light
a
beautiful
ruby
glint
will
come
through
huge
rocky
dark
tan
head
that
reduces
but
doesnt
quite
disappear
its
got
aromas
somewhere
between
an
imperial
stout
and
a
sweet
barleywine
not
like
bigfoot
more
like
victorys
old
horizontal
then
imagine
it
combined
with
storm
king
tastes
of
slightly
burnt
raisins
and
prunes
with
a
bit
of
licorice
and
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolately
sweetness
nice
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
not
too
strong
but
definitely
there
whoa
baby
this
is
a
treat
and
i
like
it
my
first
and
definately
not
last
baltic
porter
drinks
much
like
an
imperial
stout
as
it
should
great
nightcap
beer
i
had
earlier
rated
this
beer
pretty
as
being
pretty
poor
but
wondered
if
i
had
gotten
a
bad
bottle
given
other
beeradvocates
favorable
opinions
consequently
i
decided
to
give
it
another
chance
glad
i
did
and
i
do
believe
there
must
have
been
a
problem
with
the
last
bottle
which
i
described
as
tasting
like
sam
adams
tripple
bock
gone
bad
on
second
try
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
burned
prune
character
and
a
solid
alcohol
punch
lots
of
depth
of
flavor
brent
from
kentucky
is
dead
wrong
he
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
or
he
is
not
familiar
with
the
baltic
porter
style
these
porters
are
strong
okicim
being
at
8
1
with
an
aggressive
sometimes
sweet
roasted
malt
profile
okicim
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
not
as
sweet
as
dojidily
sp
and
not
as
aggressive
on
the
roastyness
as
say
sinebrychoff
if
you
like
a
nice
aggressive
porter
definitely
give
okocim
huge
fan
or
porters
but
hated
this
one
not
a
fan
of
this
porter
overall
tasty
good
looking
a
very
good
beer
smoke
on
the
finish
nice
nice
dark
very
dark
in
the
glass
with
small
head
bitter
taste
hits
on
the
first
sip
but
seems
to
recede
as
you
drink
slightly
less
pleasant
than
the
brand
dobbelbock
food
match
chocolate
roasted
rib
eye
steaks
with
au
gratin
potato
and
roasted
pumpkin
with
a
rich
dark
gravy
simmering
away
all
over
that
shit
o
an
exemplary
baltic
porter
with
big
aromatics
bold
flavours
and
a
very
smooth
palate
definitely
lives
up
to
its
firstclass
reputation
deep
practically
black
color
fruity
and
sweet
aroma
like
prunes
and
molasses
similar
taste
fruity
and
roasted
smokey
coffee
and
cocoa
bittersweet
finish
full
bodied
and
heavy
with
a
fairly
low
carbonation
you
cant
really
taste
the
high
alcohol
content
but
youll
certainly
know
its
there
by
the
time
you
finish
this
great
porter
overall
a
shockingly
good
porter
full
mouth
flavors
great
balance
and
complexity
as
this
is
more
of
a
symphony
vs
a
few
hard
punches
what
makes
this
really
nice
is
the
price
of
1
99
a
bottle
at
my
local
garden
fresh
i
will
pick
up
a
few
of
these
every
time
i
shop
pick
up
a
few
for
yourself
if
you
come
across
them
highly
recommend
please
note
ive
updated
this
review
as
my
first
bottle
of
this
was
9
months
past
the
best
by
date
it
was
pretty
good
but
was
overwhelmed
with
astringent
dark
fruit
flavors
and
a
slight
balsamiclike
vinegariness
a
fresh
bottle
is
a
real
treat
and
an
excellent
representative
of
the
style
i
would
even
call
it
imperial

a

come

at

a

i
was
a

disappointed
by
the
smell
or
lack
thereof
but
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
very
malty
but
with
a
nice
combination
of
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
molasses
its
a
little
sweeter
than
other
baltic
porters
ive
had
it
has
a
very
nice

feel
overall
an
excellent
porter
which
i
will
enjoy
again
not
the
greatest

taste
overall
damn
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
love
the
malt
and
the
dark
chocolate
which
blended
perfectly
with
the
coffee
and
hops
outstanding
i
will
def
pick
this
one
up
again
o
much
better
than
i
remember
it
which
was
medicinal
near
fusel
and
the
last
time
i
had
this
im
pretty
sure
they
were
still
in
co
at
the
price
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
been
surprised
and
pleased
with
the
improvement
in
quality
coming
back
to
trying
this
brand
after
a
good
78
years
very
good
porter
a
bit
too
carbonated
though
almost
takes
away
from
the
mouthfeel
i
got
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
something
sweet
perhaps
vanilla
or
even
maybe
a
sweet
fig
very
very
tasty
but
the
mouthfeel
was
strange
due
to
the
carbonation
poured
a
deep
brown
with
reddish
highlights
around
the
edges
a
mile
high
head
with
some
rather
large
bubbles
interspersed
in
the
tan
foam
this
left
a
pronounced
lacing
on
the
glass
and
thin
islan
of
the
tan
foam
remained
for
the
duration
the
smell
is
darkly
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
prominent
alcohol
i
had
this
at
just
under
room
temprature
and
it
tasted
aggresively
bitter
but
in
a
good
way
alchohol
hits
pretty
hard
not
really
hidden
at
all
the
rosty
taste
of
this
reminds
me
of
a
good
stout
but
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
and
quite
effervescent
this
one
is
good
but
lacking
in
subtlety
this
was
certainly
strong
but
it
did
not
feel
strong
as
the
alcohol
was
wellrecessed
for
something
the
looked
like
vanilla
extract
this
had
a
lot
going
on
since
the
vanilla
was
only
a
small
aspect
of
what
was
found
here
as
so
many
have
alluded
to
on
here
this
is
by
far
flying
dogs
best
beer
most
of
their
other
offerings
tasted
similar
to
each
other
but
like
the
smuttynose
robust
porter
this
ones
a
standout
thats
not
to
be
missed
part
porter
part
stout
part
scotch

this
was
a
beer
thats
unlike
anything
else
on
the
shelf
and
deserves
to
be
a
winter
staple
in
anyones
stash
overall
this
was
quite
different
from
the
reviews
i
read
coffee
carbonated
and
crisp
still
very
enjoyable
though
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
porters
you
can
get
in
a
bottle
the
taste
is
superb
and
the
minimal
head
has
a
dark
brown
color
if
your
taste
buds
are
itching
for
a
porter
this
one
will
definitely
hit
the
spot
o
an
odd
hybrid
of
ipa
and
porter
with
the
qualities
of
each
and
almost
like
a
stout
in
its
complexity
and
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
hides
the
high
abv
great
beer
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
this
i
n
the

reminds

of

wouldve

for
me
to
hail
it

not

to
find
it

will

drinkability

it
has
a

prounounced
malty
roasted

flavor
to
it
although
nothing
too
complex
it
definitely
has
a
boozy
taste
to
it
it
is
not
trying
to
hide
the
alcohol
content
that
is
for
sure
it
leaves
a
good
taste
in
my
mouth
afterwards
and
is
not
too
tough
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
will
set
you
straight
without
any
trouble
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
eat
while
grilling
burgers
o
complex
and
aged
well
o
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
it
is
9

but
you
dont
get
much
heat
the
limitation
is
the
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
no
way
to
chug
it
that
combined
with
the
dry
finish
make
this
a
nice
slow
relaxing
brew
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
forward
as
the
beer
warms
it
takes
over
for
the
chocolate
taste
one
is
definitely
enough
of
these
they
pack

great

i
think
what
some
other
people
said
about
the
alcohol
taste
may
be
changed
due
to
this
being
the
2013
vintage
but
then
again
maybe
not
its

imperial
porter
with
no
harsh
bitter
or
alcohol
flavors
whatsoever
recommendation
buy
a
couple
6packs
to
store
and
drink
long
after
youve
forgotten
about
them
o
very
surprised
with
this
beer
perfectly
balanced
will
purchase
many
many
more
times
355ml
weizen
glass
o
hunter
thompson
would
be
proud
of
this
gonzo
creation
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
the
excessiveness
why
not
throw
in
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
nice
doggie
o
good
imp
porterstout
nice
flavors
that
seem
to
be
haunted
by
bits
of
fusel
alcohol
that
tend
to
creep
in
and
out
of
the
taste
but
lots
of
flavor
and
comes
at
a
decent
pours
a
dark
brown
with
over
two
fingers
of
head
that
enjoyed
really
healthy
retention
and
produced
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
quite
hoppy
and
not
terribly
roasty
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
present
upfront
but
the
hop
qualities
of
this
offering
stand
out
above
the
malt
profile
this
is
more
of
a
black
ale
than
a
baltic
porter
for
example
the
body
is
far
too
thin
for
a
baltic
but
right
onpoint
for
a
solid
black
ale
o
i
cant
recall
ever
having
a
bottle
of
gonzo
develop
the
way
this
fresh
one
has
more
often
than
not
theyre
hopforward
with
a
subtle
but
beefy
malt
backbone
that
balances
nicely
but
this
bottle
in
particular
starting
with
the
weird
aroma
is
throwing
me
off
usually
better
than
this
unfortunately
price
point
312
oz
single
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
on
a
completely
superficial
note
i
love
the
hunter
s
thompson
quotes
and
steadman
art
on
the
bottle
so
much
that
ill
be
keeping
it
around
with
such
a
high
abv
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
12
at
a
time
but
it
is
a
nice
switch
from
the
sweeter
more
chocolatey
porters
im
used
to
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
also
there
is
quite
a
difference
in
aroma
and
flavor
after
letting
the
beer
warm
for
a
few
moments
much
smoother
and
less
sharp
alcohol
flavors
i
found
the
nitro
version
enjoyable
if
not
exceptional
flying
dog
is
usually
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
one
bucked
the
trend
to
be
a
solid
maybe
for
in
the
rotation
overall
a
good
breakfast
beer
without
coffee
flying
dog
sometimes
uses
this
as
a
base
for
more
extreme
beers
aroma
chalky
cocoa
nibs
coffee
beans
subtle
hops
and
resin
appearance
deep
brownish
appearance
with
a
two
finger
head
and
very
beautiful
lacing
taste
oily
in
texture
with
well
balanced
flavors
of
coffee
beans
fudge
cocoa
nibs
toffee
roasted
caramel
and
subtle
dark
chocolate
overall
the
alcohol
is
really
well
masked
but
you
can
definitely
feel
it
the
finish
leaves
a
dry
bitter
chocolate
almost
like
taking
a
bite
of
a
hershey
bar
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
beer
the
balance
is
very
impressive
this
is
so
tasty
its
completely
black
with
no
light
getting
through
the
sweet
smell
sets
the
tone
for
the
taste
the
taste
has
such
a
sweet
quality
to
it
with
hints
of
chocolate
some
type
of
fruit
and
maybe
a
bit
of
coffee
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
bitter
almost
a
vodka
feel
to
it
i
would
get
this
again
this
beer
turned
me
on
to
porters
ive
tried
a
few
different
porters
but
never
enjoyed
them
perhaps
its
the
artwork
or
hunter
s
thompson
quote
but
this
strong
stuff
goes
down
good
had
it
fairly
fresh
and
it
had
a
decent
hoppy
taste
for
a
porter
perhaps
the
reason
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
other
porters
if
your
a
fan
of
flying
dog
ralph
steadman
or
hunter
thompson
this
is
a
must
try
keep
it
gonzo
this
held
up
well
over
2
years
and
may
have
actually
improved
as
the
dark
fruit
flavors
have
evolved
and
add
an
extra
element
to
this
brew
was
happy
with
the
results
of
this
aging
i
found
this
improved
greatly
after
it
warmed
and
had
time
to
air
and
settle
so
if
you
read
this
it
will
help
the
experience
taste
a
bit
one
dimensional
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
malt
but
mostly
a
strange
alcohol
aggressiveness
but
not
hot
extremely
well
done
this
is
a
big
porter
as
stated
by
others
this
could
easily
pass
as
a
stout
nice
flavors
and
aroma
a
solid
effort
overall
for
a
porter
it
is
nothing
special
the
taste
isnt
horrible
but
its
just
so
meh
that
i
really
dont
care
to
even
taste
it
again
i
still
have
some
left
as
im
typing
this
review
and
heavily
debating
if
i
even
want
to
drink
the
rest
i
had
high
expectations
after
reading
the
bottle
and
flying
dogs
claiming
they
put
their
heart
and
soul
into
this
beer
if
this
is
all
they
have
to
offer
id
suggest
they
just
shut
down
their
brewery
right
now
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
from
the
bottle
with
a
brown
one
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
strong
chocolate
and
sweet
candy
malt
aromas
and
just
a
hint
of
pine
smells
incredibly
sweet
with
hints
of
vanilla
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
that
has
chocolate
up
front
and
a
bitter
chocolate
finish
sweet
chocolate
aftertaste
lingers
a
good
while
this
could
definitely
pass
as
a
stout
as
it
is
pretty
thick
a
very
nice
offering
from
my
hometown
brewery
the
description
by

below
is
more
knowledgable
and
informative
than
mine
by
far
but
our
numerical
rating
is
about
the
same
read
his
description
friend
sent
this
one
over
to
try
i
am
typically
iffy
with
flying
dog
but
here
we
go
good
looking
beer
with
an
excellent
smell
taste
is
good
and
the
beer
gets
a
lot
of
bonus
points
for
the
abv
has
a
big
taste
but
you
do
not
realize
the
alcohol
content
good
beer
that
i
may
not
buy
as
a
sixer
but
would
gladly
grad
in
mixed
six
a
big
flavored
beer
that
does
not
joke
around
with
big
bitterness
its
a
good
drinking
baltic
porter
that
has
a
good
amount
flavor
throughout
an
exceptional
beer
and
one
that
comes
across
as
incredibly
complex
yet
still
highly
drinkable
with
a
high
alcohol
content
that
is
pretty
well
hidden
throughout
the
beer
is
one
that
gets
better
with
each
sip
and
is
one
that
initially
feels
as
if
it
will
be
too
boozy
but
somehow
settles
down
very
nicely
indeed
unique
and
complex
tasty
and
well
balanced
even
though
it
is
bold
and
full
of
character
this
is
a
great
beer
i
hadnt
seen
that
coming
based
on
its
label
o
age
has
mellowed
this
one
considerably
flavors
are
super
well
integrated
and
well
balanced
super
easy
drinking
as
a
result
tasty
roasty
imperial
porter
poured
a
dark
carmel
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
though
it
was
a
slow
pour
heavy
lacing
that
doesnt
dissipate
on
top
very
smokey
smell
and
the
malt
really
comes
through
very
intense
flavor
with
bitter
being
the
overwhelming
one
tastes
malty
with
a
flavor
almost
like
burnt
coffee
finishes
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
could
be
overpowering
if
your
not
into
that
which
i
am
and
love
slight
alcohol
taste
lingers
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
hides
the
big
abv
very
well
i
could
all
too
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
incredibly
complex
and
tons
of
flavor
with
a
powerful
abv
an
outstanding
imperial
porter
malt
dominant
with
enough
hop
and
roast
character
to
keep
the
flavor
from
being
cloying
its
a
little
hot
wish
the
underlying
fruitiness
were
more
prevalent
overall
could
not
tell
this
was
9
2
the
alcohol
is
present
but
subdued
very
balanced
beer
and
very
drinkable
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
o
interesting
beer
especially
due
to
the
high
abv
which
is
really
well
hidden
everything
is
in
a
good
balance
with
each
other
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
needs
to
get
tasted
oone
of
the
most
drinkable
9
beers
ive
had
with
that
said
id
like
some
more
of
the
robust
malt
flavors
that
us
expected
from
an
imperial
borderline
high
b
flirting
with
a
low
b
i
always
loved
this
beer
when
it
was
brewed
in
denver
and
have
greatly
missed
it
since
brewing
operations
moved
to
maryland
several
years
back
i
found
a
lone
sixpack
at
coaltrain
wine
liquor
in
colorado
springs
and
eagerly
snatched
it
up
and
yes
the
brew
is
still
tasty
after
all
this
time
retaining
the
depth
balance
and
complexity
that
marked
its
beginnings
an
iconic
imperial
dark
ale
overall
picked
up
a
six
pack
on
w
whim
just
to
try
it
overall
not
bad
but
wouldnt
categorize
it
on
the
team
of
the
elite
still
good
to
have
doesnt
hurt
to
split
a
pack
with
a
friend
salud
this
beer
is
superior
to
many
talked
about
imperial
porters
and
stouts
i
like
it
and
the
barrel
aged
version
is
fantastic
as
well
overall
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
strong
dark
ales
no
joke
the
sweetness
and
perceived
strength
of
this
really
took
me
by
surprise
maybe
i
should
not
have
had
a
russian
imperial
stout
just
before
this
because
the
hops
hit
me
after
the
sweet
chocolate
maltiness
of
the
stout
i
like
hoppy
beers
and
would
probably
like
this
one
if
not
for
the
order
drank
overall
a
really
good
imperial
porter
nicely
rich
dark
and
creamy
with
a
solid
hop
backing
o
ive
only
had
a
few
baltic
porters
and
there
seems
to
be
some
leeway
to
the
style
they
come
off
light
light
stouts
somewhat
unassuming
very
drinkable
for
such
a
darklooking
beer
and
with
no
hint
of
the
high
abv
theyre
packing
i
found
this
to
be
a
fairly
unremarkable
representation
of
the
style
but
certainly
goodtasting
and
easydrinking
o
one
of
my
top
five
porters
and
will
be
sorely
missed
when
they
no
longer
allocate
to
illinois
o
i
enjoy
stronger
beers
ive
found
porters
to
be
my
go
to
beers
if
i
want
a
strong
beer
i
enjoyed
a
chili
spaghetti
dish
with
2
of
these
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
needed
a
little
time
to
linger
afterwards
being
as
its
a
bit
of
heavy
hitter
as
far
as
the
abv
goes
so
use
caution
i
highly
recommend
this
one
if
you
enjoy
porter
or
stout
beers
i
will
try
to
find
this
in
a
6
pack
and
pick
up
1
or
2
for
the
fridge
at
home
the
restaurant
charges
way
to
much
for
this
beer
on
draft
as
a
baltimore
guy
who
has
enjoyed
numerous
authentic
baltic
porters
over
in
europe
i
was
pumped
when
flying
dog
came
out
with
their
own
take
on
the
style
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
from
a
13

6
pack
from
oakdale
wine
spirits
in
catonsville
md
exceptional
version
of
a
baltic
porter
that
i
would
place
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
flying
dogs
beers
it
is
definitely
worth
a
second
buy
while
in
season
o
overall
the
flavors
seem
out
of
balance
to
me
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
sweetness
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
many
porters
and
stouts
that
i
prefer
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
overall
a
very
enjoyable
baltic
porter
cheers
try
it
and
you
will
love
it
i
do
know
i
liked
it
it
was
a
tad
harsh
though
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles

on
the
finish
there
is

the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
and
medium

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the

good

balance

very
smooth
to
sip
on
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
but
this
was
still
quite
tasty
a
very
memorable
beer
aggressive
to
a
fault
this
beer
lets
you
know
youre
drinking
it
the
entire
time
youre
drinking
it
and
haunts
your
dreams
once
you
pass
out
i
notice
most
of
the
reviews
talk
about
this
like
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
was
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
was
a
nightmare
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
overall
not
a
bad
imperial
porter
definantly
worth
the
2
single
price
i
payed
for
it
like
most
of
flying
dogs
beers
i
feel
like
its
missing
something
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
if
it
stayed
that
price
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
perfect
for
sipping
on
during
autumn
and
i
think
i
will
save
a
few
bottles
for
once
the
snow
hits
smells
and
tastes
of
generous
dark
roasted
malts
and
medium
coffee
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
elements
with
a
lighter
cherry
fruity
garnish
on
top
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
sweet
bitter
ratio
is
appealing
its
big
and
hearty
yet
smooth
in
texture
and
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
at
least
once
in
a
lifetime
overall
a
phenomenal
porter
easily
top
of
its
class
a
must
try
for
any
dark
beer
fans
cannot
believe
this
isnt
rated
higher
overall
this
was
a
great
porter
i
only
wish
the
hops
were
slightly
more
subdued
normally
i
consider
myself
a
hophead
but
the
lasting
bitterness
does
not
match
the
style
in
my
opinion
because
the
other
flavors
get
too
drowned
out
despite
this
one
balance
complaint
i
enjoyed
the
beer
immensely
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
o
an
awesome
night
cap
on
a
cold
day
it
is
a
big
beer
not
to
mention
really
filling
have
not
had
to
many
imperial
porters
but
this
one
seems
to
deliver
all
the
great
qualities
i
would
look
for
in
one
cheers
this
is
definitely
a
great
and
interesting
beer
well
put
together
and
drinks
very
well
for
the
abv
of
9
2
finishes
very
well
and
i
think
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
super
thick
almost
like
syrup
nice
hop
malt
interaction
i
enjoyed
it
but
steep
for
the
price
got
this
beer
when
i
was
looking
for
something
truly
dark
and
it
is
a
bit
too
heavy
but
has
character
one
beer
goes
a
long
way
a
bit
to
heavy
for
multiple
drinking
nice
dark
on
black
ale
with
a
couple
fingers
of
light
mocha
foam
and
a
good
velvety
texture
nice
oaty
flavor
good
dry
cocoa
and
toast
flavors
nice
flavor
is
slightly
bitter
and
charred
flavors
hide
in
this
alongside
coffee
a
bit
empty
bodied
with
higher
carb
which
is
sharp
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
s
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
particularly
special
cant
see
specifically
seeking
this
out
o
a
solid
baltic
porter
with
some
nice
complexities
and
nuances
absolutely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
crazy
special
there
are
better
imperial
portersstouts
out
there
but
this
is
a
fine
offering
just
i
like
something
with
a
little
bit
more
flavor
cheers
overall
i
like
flying
dog
and
this
one
reaffirms
why
i
like
the
brewery
good
tasting
at
a
good
price
this
one
works
for
me
the
pour
is
smooth
and
viscous
promising
the
appearance
is
blackishbrown
with
golden
head
of
about
10
the
aroma
is
toast
caramel
earth
coffee
initial
taste
of
roses
moving
under
the
tongue
with
bittersweet
coffee
mushrooms
long
finish
with
green
acidic
tones
this
is
an
exciting
portervery
unique
the
only
thing
that
keeps
it
from
having
a
more
perfect
rating
is
the
lack
of
caramel
overtones
in
the
finish
that
was
promised
in
the
chocolate
aroma
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
quicky
receding
one
finger
of
brown
head
leaving
decent
lacing
smells
like
a
hell
of
a
porter
lots
and
lots
of
vanilla
coming
through
here
light
malts
as
well
tastes
somewhat
like
a
mediumdark
coffee
black
coffee
beans
vanilla
extract
and
small
amounts
of
malt
for
this
beer
being
9
2
i
cannot
believe
that
it
actually
tastes
this
good
the
mouthfeel
allows
the
alcoholic
side
of
this
brew
to
come
out
retains
all
flavors
except
for
the
vanilla
sadly
overall
this
is
a
great
porter
that
anybody
could
drink
meh
part
of
its
the
style
part
the
execution
passable
but
not
more
than
once
o
not
bad
at
all
not
the
right
season
for
it
of
course
but
still
very
good
this
beer
pours
a
lightscouring
black
a
void
through
which
nothing
may
be
seen
the
head
is
a
creamy
and
thick
french
beige
colored
mass
which
persist
as
long
as
your
beer
does
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
one
of
rich
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
similarly
the
taste
is
an
mighty
combination
of
primarily
malt
and
chocolate
with
slight
dark
fruits
and
acidity
playing
the
side
kicks
unfortunately
about
seventy
five
percent
through
this
experience
an
acrid
and
harsh
flavor
comes
through
this
beer
feels
amazing
in
your
mouth
because
it
seems
to
float
on
your
tongue
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
excellent
the
taste
is
hampered
by
the
late
acridness
but
it
is
still
an
amazing
porter
o
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
has
a
really
nice
chocolatecoffee
quality
while
keeping
everything
pretty
wellintegrated
for
the
abv
it
doesnt
conpletely
pull
it
off
as
the
booze
exposes
some
flabbiness
in
the
flavor
profile
but
it
largely
achieves
its
goal
of
a
robust
wellrounded
flavorful
porter
nice
overall
strange
how
theres
very
little
flavor
midtaste
but
that
nice
coffee
aftertaste
makes
up
for
whats
lacking
after
the
initial
chocolatey
tones
wear
off
i
dont
know
that
its
quite
worth
the
asking
price
but
if
you
buy
the
ticket
take
the
ride
odtook
me
far
too
long
to
try
this
it
is
pretty
damn
good
for
a
big
porter
doesnt
reach
a
supremely
memorable
status
in
my
mind
but
this
is
an
abovesolid
high
gravity
porter
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
hovering
around
15
a
sixer
this
beer
is
very
pricey
the
single
i
bought
should
suffice
o
very
impressive
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
would
almost
classify
this
as
a
stout
more
than
a
porter
if
i
didnt
know
better
strong
tasty
beer
yet
also
not
overwhelming
good

also
awesome
art

ralph
steadman
and
respectable

taste
is

heavy
on
the
burnt

and
with
a
lingering
booziness
finishes
on

a
powerful
and

and
certainly
one

o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
blurs
the
line
between
porter
and
imperial
stout
its
one
of
my
favorite
dark
beers
for
daily
drinking
it
doesnt
get
a
whole
lot
better
than
this
for
the
price

nice

a
bold
porter
which
is
suitable
considering
its
name
im
not
usually
into
porters
but
this
was
exceptional
quite
pleasant
to
enjoy
slowly
strong
hints
of
molasses
with
a
kind
of
syrupy
sticky
texture
doesnt
taste
overwhelmingly
of
coffee
which
ive
experienced
with
other
porters
would
definitely
recommend
for
a
unique
experience
the
body
combines
creaminess
with
chewiness
in
a
big
warm
fuzzball
of
balance
that
teases
you
with
a
syrupy
feint
in
all
a
maginifiecent
specimen
of
that
noble
style
we
call
baltic
porter
oh
yeah
i
forgot
gonzo
if
there
really
is
a
right
way
to
do
an
imperial
porter
im
convinced
this
is
it
kudos
to
you
flying
dog
overall
the
main
reason
why
im
not
going
all
out
and
giving
full
marks
for
the
individual
sections
is
because
i
havent
tried
the
variation
of
this
beer
yet
i
wonder
if
they
could
actually
have
made
it
any
better
because
it
is
an
excellent
imperial
porter
its
not
trying
to
be
anything
fancy
just
a
full
on
robust
porter
with
all
the
depth
you
could
want
good
stuff
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
for
an
imperial
and
the
beer
is
a
touch
too
bitter
for
me
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
seems
to
have
held
up
well
for
a
few
years
a
good
not
great
beer
that
was
worth
trying
there
are
too
many
better
beers
out
there
to
drink
though
overall
i
liked
it
enough
but
if
youre
coming
here
thinking
youre
going
to
get
gonzo
forget
about
it
this
is
pretty
much
an
entirely
different
beer
o
solid
offering
from
flying
dog
has
a
great
nose
that
you
could
smell
all
day
surprisingly
hoppy
for
the
style
will
be
curious
to
see
how
the
ba
gonzo
is
and
if
it
helps
to
mellow
out
some
of
this
beers
rough
edges
oa
delicious
porter
with
good
flavor
and
balance
overall
very
nice
brew
i
like
the
estery
presence
with
the
roasted
malt
and
light
sweetness
just
a
very
tasty
brew
this
is
nice
beer
its
complex
rich
hoppy
chocolaty
smooth
drinkable
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
overall
i
liked
this
imperial
porter
a
lot
but
it
was
kind
of
unbalanced
maybe
a
little
schizo
aroma
was
somewhat
lacking
taste
was
good
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
really
good
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
i
would
poured
into
a
gulden
draak

a
very
dark

half

creamy
dark

with
good

and

nice

aroma

dark

vanilla
medicinal

perhaps
some
woody
notes
taste
is
dark
and
roasted
malt
some
smoked
malt
dark
fruit
coffee
and
chocolate
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
at
the
end
very
nice
exactly
what
i
would
like
to
see
in
an
imperial
porter
creamy
bodied
and
tasty
this
beer
came
together
really
well
almost
enough
to
jack
up
the
overall
score
a
notch
i
enjoy
it
thoroughly
for
what
its
intended
to
be
an
imperial
porter
recommended
o
a
strong
porter
easy
to
drink
but
filling
the
taste
is
one
of
a
roasty
malt
flavor
much
like
what
you
smell
at
first
it
is
extremely
smooth
with
a
heavy
chocolate
sweet
aftertaste
after
a
while
it
takes
on
a
burnt
dark
nut
flavor
and
a
more
bitter
dry
after
taste
the
roasted
malt
flavor
really
sticks
with
you
throughout
your
gonzo
trip
o
overall
im
glad
i
opened
this
bottle
but
think
it
would
have
been
even
more
interesting
to
let
it
go
further
still
a
7
year
old
vintage
tasted
just
great
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
porters
to
drink
but
aging
this
rare
bottle
for
7
years
was
a
great
idea
and
a
chance
to
really
taste
its
complexity
loved
it
o
its
a
very
dangerous
beer
it
has
a
higher
abv
but
i
am
not
tasting
it
hidden
behind
some
nice
flavors
of
roast
and
chocolate
this
is
a
surprise
for
me
overall
a
nice
strong
bold
and
roasty
brew
with
a
good
rounding
of
flavors
and
a
kickin
alcohol
finish
o
this
is
my
first
review
on
here
and
this
is
also
my
first
baltic
porter
though
i
have
tried
a
decent
amount
of
other
types
of
porters
and
stouts
it
was
much
more
hoppy
and
alcoholic
than
other
porters
and
stouts
i
have
tried
but
still
very
well
balanced
with
lots
of
malty
goodness
overall
i
would
say
this
is
an
amazingly
complex
and
delicious
tasting
beer
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
in
this
style
nearly
jet
black
less
than
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
some
rings
of
lace
around
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
bittersweet
and
milk
chocolate
liquorice
bitter
hop
and
bitter
coffee
are
there
as
well
taste
is
roasty
dark
malts
quite
hoppy
and
bitter
throughout
chocolate
anise
and
liquorice
are
there
but
seem
subtle
some
fruit
and
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
with
dark
malts
also
got
hints
of
smoke
on
some
sips
medium
carbonation
medium
body
with
some
syrupy
and
creamy
points
really
good
stuff
abv
nowhere
to
be
found
worth
picking
up
again
o
really
prefer
this
one
with
some
age
first
time
aging
a
big
porter
but
its
turned
out
to
be
a
success
it
again
the
alcohol
was
hidden
pretty
well
and
it
was
suprisingley
good
even
though
i
am
not
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
rich
malty
beers
i
would
definitely
sip
it
and
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
o
this
is
a
homerun
staple
offering
priced
right
at
around
2
per
bottle
you
absolutely
cannot
go
wrong
here
my
favorite
flying
dog
beer
with
raging
bitch
being
a
close
second
overy
enjoyable
o
i
think
its
excellent
but
it
could
have
been
a
bonafide
world
beater
if
the
complex
flavor
profile
were
bolder
despite
that
this
is
a
high
quality
porter
that
could
almost
almost
pass
for
a
stout
at
times
thats
a
good
thing
thumbs
up
t
a
brief
bit
of
molasses
and
black
licorice
upfront
and
then
a
turn
to
darker
flavors
of
charred
malt
and
dark
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
maybe
i
was
just
really
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
tonight
but
this
really
hits
the
spot
o
good
beer
want
to
give
it
another
shot
as
i
split
a
beer
with
a
friend
tasty
and
complex
overall
this
is
a
fine
porter
strong
and
robust
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
overtone
gives
it
some
vibrancy
being
fairly
smooth
on
the
palate
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
the
high
abv
would
limit
me
to
one
or
two
per
sitting
4
o
huge
bold
flavors
that
make
this
beer
really
interesting
however
its
dangerously
easy
to
drink
it
feels
light
enough
on
the
palate
to
go
down
a
little
bit
too
easily
as
im
sitting
here
in
my
unheated
apartment
with
a
chocolate
brownie
its
perfect
overall
i
think
this
is
fantastic
beer
i
recently
reviewed
ba
gonzo
and
so
when
i
came
by
this
single
bottle
i
had
to
purchase
and
review
it
the
ba
version
is
much
better
but
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
an
imperial
porter
o
this
is
a
really
good
baltic
porter
looks
phenominal
and
smells
pretty
good
too
i
liked
this
better
than
the
baird
kurofune
porter
o
terrific
beer
the
flavors
are
big
and
bold
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
the
abv
is
hidden
well
overall
great
bear
could
easily
be
confused
for
a
chocolate
stout
oalmost
like
a
black
ipa
is
the
bitterness
in
the
beer
well
balanced
one
of
flying
dogs
best
offerings
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
only
a
hint
of
ruby
in
the
highlights
under
light
the
head
is
very
low
profile
sitting
about
a
half
an
inch
and
it
is
a
dark
beige
coloring
solid
and
dense
aromas
are
rich
with
a
creamy
backbone
and
a
coffee
bitterness
a
touch
of
booze
in
the
nose
as
well
flavors
are
rich
also
with
a
dark
fruit
sweetness
on
the
initial
taste
followed
by
some
roasted
coffee
bitterness
and
a
smokey
overtone
flavors
are
very
well
blended
and
the
booze
characteristics
make
their
presence
felt
on
the
transition
between
the
flavor
and
the
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
continues
with
a
nutty
and
dark
roasted
sweetness
the
finish
has
a
decent
linger
but
not
overpowering
good
beer
o
i
had
been
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
this
for
a
while
never
had
good
timing
before
the
stores
ran
out
worth
the
wait
the
aroma
is
lacking
but
the
flavor
is
where
it
works
its
magic
very
well
balanced
great
combination
of
flavors
this
is
probably
my
favorite
stronger
porter
i
like
it
when
its
fresh
and
hoppy
and
also
when
its
not
for
the
price
of
7
50
a
4
pack
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
turn
a
beer
like
this
down
a
great
one
to
drink
fresh
or
cellar
overall
pretty
solid
porter
here
the
taste
is
aggressive
and
seems
to
pack
a
punch
and
fade
away
for
being
advertised
as
an
imperial
porter
i
was
expecting
a
touch
more
but
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
in
its
own
right

with
a
wisp

sweet
malty
aroma
fills
the

hints

i

anymore
an
excellent
winter
sipping
beer
a
fine
imperial
porter
that
matched
very
well
with
my
fish
pie
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
imperial
porter
this
is
one
really
dark
brew
this
porter
could
easily
be
a
stout
just
by
looking
at
it
the
color
is
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
looking
mocha
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
is
rich
and
very
roasted
with
some
chocolate
on
the
nose
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
heavly
roasted
with
some
dark
chocolate
bitterness
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
heavy
but
silkty
smooth
in
texture
overall
its
one
of
the
better
porters
out
there
in
my
opinion
i
would
drink
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
sweet
hot
big
and
bitter
brew
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
gonzo
pours
almost
entirely
black
with
just
wispy
amber
highlights
gracing
the
outskirts
of
the
glass
there
are
about
three
fingers
of
tan
head
and
retention
is
very
good
theres
a
solid
ring
of
lace
that
marks
the
high
point
of
the
beer
but
everything
underneath
is
a
bit
more
spotty
the
nose
is
fairly
weak
but
i
do
pick
out
a
little
bit
of
coffee
as
well
as
some
roasted
grain
the
flavors
got
some
more
life
to
it
but
not
too
much
theres
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
that
creeps
in
especially
as
the
beer
warms
and
plays
off
the
coffee
well
that
roasty
quality
is
also
still
there
and
while
its
definitely
not
as
prominent
as
the
chocolate
or
coffee
i
still
wish
it
was
dialed
back
a
little
bit
more
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
either
the
body
is
a
touch
thin
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
too
bubbly
if
not
for
a
certain
silkiness
thats
also
appreciable
it
would
be
entirely
a
lost
cause
i
have
to
say
ive
heard
plenty
of
good
things
about
flying
dogs
gonzo
but
to
me
it
was
just
ok
a
nice
surprise
from
flying
dog
i
tried
this
beer
a
year
ago
before
i
was
such
a
hop
head
and
didnt
like
it
now
that
i
like
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
hops
it
seems
a
bit
more
complex
and
worthwhile
im
not
a
big
fan
of
stouts
and
porters
especially
the
imperial
kind
but
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
o
this
is
a
good
imperial
porter
that
hides
its
alcohol
really
well
my
favorite
aspect
is
the
molasses
flavors
i
love
that
syruppy
molasses
taste
not
a
beer
id
have
around
often
but
would
gladly
drink
more
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
modest
carbonation
feels
very
very
much
like
an
imperial
stoutbringing
up
the
old
debate
about
how
the
porter
and
stout
styles
are
defined
this
is
a
big
tasty
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
porter
even
imperial
or
baltic
has
the
booze
sweetness
and
sticky
full
body
of
an
imperial
stout
nothing
light
about
this
one
powerful
overall
gonzo
is
a
rich
and
flavourful
strong
porter
with
an
impressive
degree
of
complexity
i
enjoyed
sipping
my
pint
over
the
course
of
an
hour
and
i
would
gladly
buy
this
beer
again
overall
this
beer
is
special
to
me
it
was
the
cause
of
my
obsession
with
craft
beer
although
ive
had
many
great
beers
since
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
it
is
still
very
delicious
i
shared
this
beer
with
the
wife
pouring
it
into
a
pint
glass
blackishbrown
color
with
a
wellretaining
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
coffee
and
strangely
quite
a
pronounced
hop
profile
taste
was
not
what
i
expected
the
wife
took
the
first
sip
and
recoiled
a
bit
claiming
it
seemed
more
like
a
cascadian
dark
ale
aka
black
ipa
as
she
put
it
but
its
a
term
i
hate
to
use
in
a
bit
of
disbelief
i
took
a
sip
bearing
the
aroma
in
mind
definitely
a
piney
hop
kick
right
off
the
bat
with
notes
of
rum
raisin
but
midtoendpalate
the
hoppiness
mellowed
leaving
space
for
the
cocoacoffee
duet
to
enter
finished
dry
and
roasty
and
not
that
bad
at
all
medium
body
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
still
good
o
the
label
claims
this
beer
to
be
as
complex
as
the
man
its
celebrating
this
is
very
true
drinking
like
a
great
stout
gonzo
is
amazing
and
gets
better
as
it
sits
id
definately
seek
this
one
out
again
the
taste
is
remarkable
and
starts
with
a
nice
mellow
chocolate
flavor
being
combined
immediately
with
distinct
expresso
in
the
middle
the
roasted
malts
bitter
the
beer
into
balance
and
the
finish
has
a
slight
burned
cigar
flavor
to
it
very
nicely
balanced
and
smooth
a
great
porter
o
a
surprisingly
damn
good
porter
flying
dog
has
been
iffy
with
its
selection
but
this
one
was
nice
dark
espresso
deep
cocoa
slick
burnt
cigar
offering
pours
dark
brown
with
beautiful
mochaespressotan
head
nose
reveals
caramel
coffee
fruitcake
and
some
sour
astringent
notes
lurking
around
somewhere
flavor
has
a
sourish
dimension
too
mostly
i
get
slightly
burnt
coffee
caramelized
fruit
pine
resins
and
cocoa
all
in
all
good
but
did
not
meet
my
expectations
mostly
due
to
the
lingering
burntsour
flavors
on
the
aftertaste
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
overdone
mouthfeel
smooth
but
unremarkable
this
is
one
id
like
to
try
on
draft
before
i
give
my
final
verdict
but
not
sure
if
i
can
find
it
that
way
this
gives
a
set
that
holds
water
and
can
be
classified
as
soon
as
porters
which
is
a
good
place
for
flying
dog
has
the
art
to
disperse
flavors
and
levels
of
losing
the
thread
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
would
like
to
try
this
with
a
little
more
age
on
it
to
see
if
it
siftens
up
a
bit
o
damn
fine
baltic
porter
nose
could
be
a
bit
more
in
your
face
but
overall
a
quality
brew
the
beer
is
solid
not
the
best
porter
you
could
ask
for
but
far
from
the
worst
i
think
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
i
admire
what
flying
dog
did
with
this
beer
o
this
stuff
was
fantastic
strong
bold
flavours
but
still
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
bold
beer
that
you
can
have
several
of
without
being
overwhelmed
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
o
loved
this
beer
on
the
first
tasting
back
when
hst
passed
pick
it
up
everytime
i
see
it
easily
my
favorite
flying
dog
and
one
of
my
favorite
porters
overall
an
enjoyable
experience
wont
deny
this
beer
in
the
future
and
would
like
to
experience
it
on
tap
o
a
big
beer
with
big
intentions
that
it
delivers
on
very
drinkable
with
the
high
abv
not
even
close
to
noticeable
so
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
o
a
really
epic
porter
this
is
an
intense
flavorful
beer
but
not
the
best
of
the
imperial
porter
family
given
my
choice
i
go
with
sam
adams
imperial
stout
4

an
excellent
drink
very
well
balanced
and
flavorful
overall
a
decent
porter
definitely
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
good
for
the
colder
weather
o
dogfish
head
does
not
disappoint
this
is
a
well
quality
put
together
porter
many
porter
come
up
short
but
i
think
this
one
is
a
strong
ahead
of
the
pack
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
imperial
porter
really
like
the
dark
complex
flavors
will
definitely
enjoy
this
one
throughout
the
fall
n
winter
months
highly
recommend
o
an
imperial
porter
with
roasted
malty
nutty
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
certain
edge
of
zesty
hops
and
spices
sturdy
tasty
and
pleasing
but
if
anything
it
lacks
some
balance
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
just
right
for
a
porter
lingering
aftertaste
of
hops
coating
pallete
with
some
sweetness
as
well
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
seems
a
bit
heavy
for
a
porter
but
is
just
about
right
for
an
imperial
porter
the
body
is
thick
and
coating
and
only
slightly
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
not
overly
noticeable
but
is
certainly
doing
a
lot
of
work
in
the
background
overall
if
you
find
this
beer
try
it
out
if
i
didnt
already
know
and
love
flying
dog
beers
i
would
probably
buy
it
because
i
am
a
fan
of
hunter
s
thompson
and
ralph
steadman
i
think
its
awesome
he
does
their
artwork
i
personally
love
any
kind
of
imperial
beer
stout
pumpkin
porter
etc
if
its
done
right
it
gives
the
brewery
a
chance
to
shine
and
flying
dog
has
won
it
with
this
beer
not
my
favorite
samuel
smiths
imperial
stout
is
still
first
but
a
very
close
2nd
perfect
on
a
cold
day
will
definitely
buy
again
o
nothing
bright
radical
or
out
of
the
box
on
this
one
just
a
nice
easy
drinking
porter
that
happens
to
be
9
2
yikes
overall
i
really
do
want
to
like
this
and
if
flying
dog
brought
out
the
porter
notes
or
even
maybe
tweaked
it
with
something
other
than
the
alcohol
burn
this
could
be
really
good
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
i
plan
on
laying
down
a
couple
in
my
cellar
to
see
what
happens
to
the
spicy
hop
notes
and
the
alcohol
warmth
this
was
an
interesting
creation
much
like
mr
thompson
was
r
i
p
the
main
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
bitter
lingering
aftertaste
the
color
is
nicely
dark
the
aroma
not
overpowering
but
as
usual
it
all
comes
down
to
taste
this
pours
a
thick
dark
blackish
color
with
a
large
mocha
head
densely
packed
with
lots
of
compact
small
bubbles
good
retention
very
nice
the
smell
is
mostly
of
roasted
malts
coffee
dark
chocolate
very
good
the
feel
is
medium
to
thick
and
creamy
the
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
there
is
a
little
hop
bite
at
the
end
but
with
this
being
aged
for
over
a
year
its
died
down
a
bunch
id
love
to
also
try
this
fresh
in
any
case
a
might
fine
beer
and
the
first
flying
dog
beer
ive
had
which
ive
actually
loved
and
not
just
liked
this
is
good
beer
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
really
enjoyed
by
flying
dog
good
job
m
mediumlarge
bodied
beer
the
carbonation
is
nice
in
this
one
for
being
3
years
old
clears
your
palate
with
a
semi
dry
finish
and
a
nice
hop
presence
very
impressive
a
big
beer
with
a
big
flavour
smooth
and
delicious
with
a
great
blend
of
malt
and
pine
the
age
on
this
bottle
may
have
attenuated
the
hops
somewhat
but
it
still
packs
a
punch
essential
drinking
dont
die
without
trying
this
o
great
brew
glad
to
be
able
to
get
this
in
legged
form
flying
dog
has
a
winner
on
its
hands
this
big
beer
pours
a
thick
tanbrownish
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
strong
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
tasting
is
very
smoothit
is
a
strong
aggressive
beer
at
9
and
you
can
sense
it
in
the
aftertaste
it
does
mellow
out
after
hitting
the
palate
quickly
this
beer
tastes
better
when
it
is
warned
a
bit
at
room
temperature
rather
than
drinking
it
cold
i
drank
this
while
eating
a
piece
of
dark
triple
layer
chocolate
cake
and
what
a
great
match
it
it
is
a
perfect
dessert
beer
the
strongness
and
bitter
coffee
taste
complimented
it
perfectly
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
porters
overall
it
was
an
good
beer
not
bad
by
any
means
at
all
but
kinda
of
a
let
down
for
me
and
i
feel
bad
for
saying
that
i
would
like
to
try
the
oak
aged
version
of
this
brew
i
think
that
would
give
it
a
sweeter
vanilla
like
flavor
or
woody
finesse
that
this
beer
is
missing
worth
picking
it
up
if
you
have
never
had
it
i
bought
a
single
to
find
out
if
i
should
buy
more
from
a
store
that
has
a
sale
ill
be
picking
up
at
least
one
4
pk
and
seeing
how
it
does
with
some
age
cheers
o
a
good
porter
made
a
little
better
for
me
cause
its
local
even
better
considering
the
flavor
profile
except
for
this
unexpectedly
tame
mouthfeel
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
finding
the
flavors
complex
and
nuanced
and
nicely
balanced
pours
a
very
dark
coffee
brown
two
fingers
of
dense
fluffy
khaki
foam
which
covers
the
glass
with
nice
lattice
of
lace
decent
retention
smell
is
very
bright
creamy
roasted
malt
some
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
undertones
on
the
palate
theres
a
punch
of
smoked
and
roasted
malt
up
front
dark
chocolate
folded
in
there
finishing
dry
with
a
moderate
aciditysourness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
theres
an
almost
harsh
off
flavor
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
although
the
carbonation
medium
is
a
bit
higher
than
would
be
ideal
mediumfull
body
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
i
remember
liking
it
a
lot
more
on
draft
though
o
it
felt
more
concerned
with
being
the
hop
forward
imperial
and
less
concerned
with
being
the
roasty
porter
the
roastiness
still
comes
through
but
it
seems
to
be
overwhelmed
at
points
by
the
hops
profile
all
in
all
i
liked
it
but
was
hoping
the
hops
would
be
a
little
more
subdued
and
subtle
while
the
malt
starred
and
i
felt
that
eventhough
the
malt
flavor
on
this
is
great
the
hops
that
didnt
compliment
it
as
much
as
subtracted
from
it
overallthis
is
a
great
beer
has
a
great
roasty
flavor
and
aroma
i
can
see
myself
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
winter
months
o
excellent
this
is
the
only
offering
from
flying
dog
i
have
ever
really
thought
was
exceptional
it
is
the
only
one
by
them
i
will
order
drank
with
a
pulledpork
sammich
for
dinner
tonight
culinary
bliss
this
beer
is
not
a
typical
porter
but
thats
okay
its
good
its
really
good
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
think
the
aftertaste
is
my
favorite
part
you
just
experience
so
many
different
flavors
in
one
sip
i
would
totally
order
this
again
bottoms
up
people
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
probably
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
flying
dog
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
does
with
some
age
overall
very
tasty
and
strong
a
true
baltic
porter
one
bottle
is
enough
to
sip
on
for
sure
might
be
flying
dogs
best
beer
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
flavor
profile
just
doesnt
really
work
for
me
its
ok
at
best
not
going
to
trip
over
myself
getting
more
oany
exceptional
and
complex
brew
that
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
certainly
not
a
session
beer
it
is
a
sipper
to
enjoy
in
a
snifter
i
encourage
everyone
a
fan
of
dark
complex
and
robust
beers
to
give
this
a
shot
as
you
will
not
be
disappointed
o
resembles
a
stout
more
than
a
porter
but
its
good
id
get
it
again
overallvery
malty
and
tasty
so
far
the
only
beer
from
this
brewery
that
has
blown
me
away
i
wish
the
finish
was
not
as
dry
but
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
way
better
than
the
smelli
would
look
for
this
again
i
would
buy
this
again
it
is
not
the
most
refined
imperial
black
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
a
mighty
fine
american
craft
beer
as
the
beer
warms
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
rounds
out
the
bitter
smooths
and
the
drink
is
easy
3
stars
first
timer
on
this
brew
i
am
pleased
even
with
the
price
tag
seems
as
this
would
roll
well
with
a
barrel
treatment
outstanding
a
great
imperial
porter
overall
great
smells
and
has
a
good
taste
to
it
well
worth
picking
up
if
youre
ever
in
the
mood
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
for
a
long
time
now
but
never
sat
down
to
review
it
until
now
pours
motor
oil
black
with
a
viscousness
that
hints
to
the
amount
of
body
and
alcohol
it
has
a
nice
three
finger
tan
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
little
while
then
left
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
thin
film
of
froth
on
the
top
aromas
are
cocoa
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
underneath
it
all
coffee
on
the
palate
bit
of
rasiny
fruit
and
a
nice
bitter
punch
to
back
up
all
of
the
sweetness
the
bitterness
seems
to
come
not
just
from
hops
but
the
darkly
roasted
malt
too
alcohol
is
apparent
but
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
and
pleasant
as
i
said
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
seeing
as
how
this
one
was
the
last
one
at
my
local
store
and
flying
dog
is
pulling
out
of
arizona
for
the
time
being
it
might
be
the
last
one
i
have
for
a
while
one
of
my
favorite
albeit
potent
pairings
is
this
beer
with
a
glass
of
neat
bourbon
or
irish
whisky
on
the
side
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
and
a
go
to
o
very
disappointed
on
this
one
9
2
and
you
know
it
not
overpowering
in
any
area
but
the
alcohol
distracts
everything
else
just
enough
do
matter
dont
know
if
this
is
a
quality
of
all
baltic
porters
or
if
others
hide
the
alcohol
much
better
glad
this
was
only
3
o
an
exceptional
porter
not
a
big
fan
of
flying
dog
but
this
one
hits
the
spot
definitely
a

in

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
baltic
porter
and
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
with
only
ever
having
two
other
baltic
porters
that
being
shipwreck
porter
and
the
barrel
aged
version
from
arcadia
this
beer
can
hold
its
own
against
the
shipwreck
porter
but
i
think
i
would
take
shipwreck
porter
over
gonzo
its
just
a
little
more
fuller
and
flavorful
but
with
gonzo
being
priced
better
and
much
more
available
to
me
i
could
see
this
being
my
go
to
baltic
porter
i
thought
this
beer
went
down
super
smooth
for
9
2
beer
and
its
drinkability
was
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
this
beer
my
least
favorite
was
the
lighter
then
usual
body
i
will
for
sure
be
buying
this
again
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
roasty
and
robust
beers
this
beer
is
right
up
their
with
horn
dog
as
my
favorite
beers
from
flying
dog
i
find
the
majority
of
their
regular
line
up
to
be
pretty
lack
luster
but
all
the
beers
i
have
had
from
the
canis
major
series
have
all
been
good
and
impressive
nice
work
flying

12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
chocolatey
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
layer
of
light
brown
head
aroma
is
of
chocolate
coffee
booze
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
a
good
deal
boozier
than
the
aroma
roasted
malts
burnt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
chocolate
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
think
this
bottle
was
from
2010
but
the
label
was
hard
to
read
and
faded
overall
its
a
decent
porter
that
drinks
fairly
well
all
things
considered
worth
grabbing
every
now
and
then
this
is
more
of
a
black
ipa
than
an
imperial
porter
but
i
like
it
its
different
than
a
typical
dark
beer
its
just
marketed
wrong
i
think
the
third
grade
kid
doing
their
artwork
is
in
charge
of
marketing
as
well
at
least
he
gets
free
beer
o
solid
porter
its
not
great
but
well
done
arcadia
makes
a
much
better
one
and
i
hold
all
to
that
light
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
its
a
great
beer
and
one
i
dont
buy
often
enough
it
really
has
a
great
range
of
flavors
to
it
but
manages
to
integrate
them
all
pretty
well
and
manages
to
feel
relatively
balanced
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
beer
and
just
a
solid
beer
overall
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
was
thinking
that
it
would
have
flavor
after
the
smell
i
will
pick
this
up
again
worth
the
money
i
would
like
to
try
the
barrelaged
version
nice
example
of
a
beefed
up
porter
rich
aromas
and
flavors
with
a
sticky
mouthfeel
hunter
s
thompson
may
have
been
a
lot
of
things
but
he
definitely
wasnt
the
inspiration
for
mediocrity
here
d
oh
man
this
is
good
with
the
light
body
a
few
could
be
put
away
i
think
aging
for
a
year
will
make
it
fantastic
and
maybe
a
all
5s
in
my
book
overall
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
baltic
porter
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
certainly
altered
due
to
the
beers
age
ill
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
compare
but
i
loved
the
way
it
aged
its
definitely
worth
putting
away
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
two
o
a
very
well
crafted
baltic
porter
the
smoke
gives
it
an
extra
flavour
nice
o
overall
a
really
good
brew
that
stands
out
compared
to
many
others
ive
gotta
go
watch
fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
now
overall
a
very
good
beer
period
but
it
has
some
flaws
that
prevent
it
from
being
a
great
world
class
beer
my
main
problem
is
that
the
alcohol
is
too
apparent
at
only
9
2
ive
had
13
beers
that
arent
as
warm
as
this
one
still
i
wouldnt
pass
on
a
gonzo
overall
this
could
be
my
new
goto
affordable
dark
beer
tons
of
flavor
and
complexity
nice
abv
and
a
really
good
price
this
beer
is
way
too
drinkable
to
be
9
2
abv
and
could
get
me
in
trouble
but
who
cares
if
it
tastes
this
good
o
a
good
beer
sweeter
and
more
bitter
than
expected
but
in
a
solid
dark
porter
kind
of
way
i
wanted
more
darkness
and
roasty
flavors
worth
a
try
d
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
hadnt
seen
it
in
years
until
a
few
weeks
ago
and
had
to
get
some
the
depth
of
flavor
is
great
and
it
is
surpirsingly
drinkable
which
can
be
dangerous
with
the
high
alcohol
content
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
d
complex
yet
muddied
at
the
same
time
the
light
body
makes
this
way
too
easy
to
drink
at
9
creamy
full
bodied
sweet
and
there
is
some
noticeable
alcohol
which
does
not
hinder
the
drinkability
or
mouthfeel
overall
a
nice
porter
d
great
dessert
drink
i
washed
down
everything
i
ate
at
bad
apple
with
this
drink
flavors
were
unique
but
not
overwhelming
and
left
me
wanting
more
perfect
roasted
flavor
notes
highly
recommended
i
love
this
beer
its
complex
looks
smells
and
tastes
great
this
is
a
sipper
for
any
occasion
otheres
a
good
beer
in
here
somewhere
too
thin
and
light
for
a
baltic
porter
which
brings
out
the
high
abv
might
improve
with
age
o
a
solid
imperial
porter
maybe
hope
for
a
bit
more
nose
and
fruit
o
struggling
between
a
3
5
or
a
4
on
this
one
its
just
not
quite
up
to
the
4
level
for
me
dont
get
me
wrong
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
quite
reach
the
level
of
some
of
flying
dogs
better
brews
solid
beer
and
worth
trying
though
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
fairly
fullbodied
and
has
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
this
brews
strong
suit
i
find
this
very
drinkable
for
such
a
robust
and
alcoholic
brew
a
strong
brew
available
at
very
good
prices
if
this
were
in
5
dollar
bombers
instead
of
3
dollar
12oz
bottles
i
think
a
lot
more
people
would
sing
its
praises
o
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
porter
on
nitrotap
it
enhanced
the
taste
and
the
overall
feeling
and
experience
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
a
bit
chewy
but
smooth
overall
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
strong
porter
but
its
a
one
and
done
kind
of
drink
trying
this
one
on
tap
certainly
piqued
my
interest
in
purchasing
the
bottled
version
drinkability
and
overall
is
okay
but
i
think
i
would
go
for
something
else
i
was
looking
to
be
really
surprised
and
wowed
by
this
but
just
wasnt
its
tasty
though
ill
give
it
that
this
isnt
a
poor
quality
release
but
i
vastly
prefer
the
sinebrychoff
over
it
both
of
which
are
widely
available
in
my
area
the
sinebrychoff
has
more
depth
to
the
nose
and
taste
buds
whereas
this
is
more
of
a
onetrick
pony
with
each
could
use
a
more
assertive
nose
and
a
more
complex
taste
package
o
great
beer
will
drink
again
o
definitely
a
solid
brew
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
yet
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
cheers
o
a
lot
of
good
flavor
with
coffee
and
fruit
notes
however
the
body
seemed
a
little
weak
in
the
face
of
the
dominant
coffee
flavor
started
with
the
flying
dog
imperial
gonzo
porter
certainly
was
timid
due
to
the
9
2
abv
not
really
one
to
bat
leadoff
but
fuck
it
the
color
was
very
very
dark
with
glorious
tan
head
actually
ran
over
my
glass
the
scent
was
mostly
booz
but
there
was
some
hint
of
malt
and
roast
the
taste
was
bolstered
by
a
wonderful
heavy
body
the
malt
came
through
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
probably
molassis
the
mouthfeel
was
tough
due
to
the
high
abv
if
it
was
a
long
winter
evening
could
do
a
couple
tonight
however
one
is
enough
o
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
flying
dog
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
the
flavors
blend
well
together
pretty
drinkable
considering
its
abv
and
style
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
over
and
over
again
a
well
balanced
brew
d
this
strong
porter
bursts
with
a
steady
progression
of
dynamic
flavors
that
are
interesting
if
a
little
clumsy
in
transition
texture
stumbles
unable
to
keep
up
but
other
qualities
seem
appropriate
overall
i
give
this
beer
a
4
0
out
of
5
overall
i
feel
it
isnt
a
baltic
porter
at
all
i
would
categorize
this
in
either
the
american
porter
or
american
black
ale
categories
or
imperial
porter
if
it
was
a
category
so
no
this
isnt
reviewed
to
style
but

a
beer
to
throwback
lots
the
m
is
the
weakest
part
of
this
brew
its
kinda
sticky
and
dose
not
curl
as
i
hoped
it
would
do
it
might
be
so
that
im
the
only
one
with
this

quality
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
texture
is
smooth
and
edgy
gonzo
indeed
i
have
had
this
in
a
bottle
with
a
chocolate
malt
presence
mouthfeel
has
a
good
tickle
of
carbonation
with
some
slight
oiliness
on
the
finish
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
its
very
tart
but
complex
with
a
slightly
resinous
full
bodied
feel
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
i
liked
the
08
much
more
a
year
later
the
alcohol
had
mellowed
considerably
plenty
of
great
aroma
from
this
this
really
improved
as
it
warmed
and
seems
like
aging
would
do
this
wonders
jamiesessions
this
is
a
good
beer
just
not
great
im
glad
i
picked
one
up
to
try
but
nothing
terribly
special
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
your
time
d
i
could
actually
go
back
for
more
of
these
unlike
some
stouts
ive
had
very
easy
to
drink
not
overpowering
but
a
great
beer
with
loads
of
stout
flavor
md
rich
and
thick
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
in
the
same
creamy
way
that
melted
milkshakes
the
carbonation
is
definitely
present
but
light
on
the
tongue
while
this
is
certainly
a
slow
drinker
it
is
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
very
easy
very
drinkable
howeverim
not
sure
where
an
imperial
porter
ends
and
stout
begins
or
that
it
matters
much
if
you
just
handed
me
this
beer
in
a
glass
id
think
stout
all
the
way
but
however
you
classifly
it
this
is
a
smooth
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
especially
for
a
cold
winter
night
like
tonight
d
definitely
a
good
treat
on
a
weekday
evening
though
the
little
7
oz
bottle
in
the
canis
major
pack
is
just
enough
after
a
few
sips
the
beer
became
more
acceptable
but
still
not
my
style
soory
for
the
ones
under
the
bas
who
are
fond
of
this
beer
drinks
pretty
well
one
of
the
better
flying
dog
beers
on
the
market
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
imperial
porter
very
similar
to
some
stouts
d
this
is
more
of
a
sipping
porter
all
other
styles
of
porters
are
usually
good
session
beers
this
one
is
good
on
a
cold
night
another
note
one
of
the
best
labels
out
there
today
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
amount
of
flavor
just
needs
more
umph
in
the
feel
and
body
i
was
excited
for
this
beer
given
that
the
double
dog
is
such
a
good
ipa
that
being
said
flying
dogs
gonzo
imperial
porter
was
a
thorough
disappointment
it
started
off
good
in
appearance
and
smell
but
it
fell
apart
when
i
actually
had
to
drink
it
my
only
hope
is
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
will
be
trying
this
beer
again
and
hopefully
ill
get
a
second
opinion
from
a
friend
next
time
luckily
at
7
8
abv
if
i
bomb
the
rest
of
this
maybe
the
alcohol
will
kill
the
unpleasant
notes
in
the
next
bottle
overall
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
the
nose
is
a
bit
sweet
and
the
taste
is
solid
but
leaves
some
room
for
improvements
has
a
high
abv
which
although
not
overwhelming
in
the
flavor
may
result
in
a
quick
intoxication
because
it
is
easier
to
drink
some
chocolate
strong
alcohol
presence
not
a
session
beer
a
bit
pricey
10
a
4pack
but
cant
say
that
its
not
worth
it
being
that
its
a
baltic
porter
there
are
some
dark
fruit
notes
and
bitterness
that
goes
into
it
that
can
be
distracting
the
heavy
burnt
malt
and
smoke
help
cover
those
a
little
bit
this
was
presented
with
a
solid
finger
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deep
dark
inky
brownishblack
with
zero
light
penetration
this
might
have
leaked
out
of
the
exxon
valdez
nose
was
redolent
with
dark
chocolate
and
darkroasted
coffee
mouthfeel
was
full
thick
silky
smooth
with
a
burnt

taste
on
the
tongue
hmm
dr
thompson
was
cremated
to
ashes
and
intermingled
into
fireworks
but
i
begin
to
fade
when
it
it
this
intense
in
its
smokiness
man
i
just
cannot
get
behind
this
beer
too
smoky
and
too
charcoal
driven
for
my
taste
if
they
could
just
dial
the
roasting
back
a
bit
fantastic
beer
looking
forward
to
the
cake
d
extremely
drinkable
for
a
baltic
porter
my
bottle
says
it
clocks
in
at
7
8abv
as
opposed
to
the
9
8
listed
on
the
beers
ba
profile
but
either
way
it
is
up
there
and
drinks
phenomenally
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
after
stupidly
overlooking
this
beer
in
many
beer
stores
over
the
past
three
or
so
years
since
i
first
saw
it
i
regret
it
pretty
powerful
flavor
will
only
allow
me
to
have
one
of
these
this
was
way
better
on
tap
still
this
is
a
really
good
beer
maybe
a
bit
pricey
though
not
quite
what
i
would
consider
a
savoring
beer
but
tasty
none
the
less
i
could
drink
this
beer
around
the
fire
in
the
winter
or
after
raking
leaves
in
the
fall
one
of
my
favorite
porters
and
aging
it
just
5
months
has
done
wonders
i
have
the
last
bottle
from
the
4pack
aging
that
i
will
drink
next
year
and
see
if
it
further
enhances
the
flavors
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
alcohol
hitting
you
in
the
face
for
a
9
8
beer
really
makes
this
a
wonderful
drinkable
beer
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
medium
heavy
body
could
drink
this
all
night
nice
and
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
flying
dog
brews
mouthfeel
is
very
smoothdrinkability
of
this
beer
is
high
not
a
big
porter
fan
but
this
is
great
08
vintage
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
but
on
another
night
the
licorice
finish
is
something
i
was
not
a
fan
of
bottle

roast
coffee

strong

and
toasty

cocoa
and
coffee
again
big
on
the

very

and
dry
very
good
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
the
alcohol
was
hidden
dangerously
well
in
this
one
even
when
warmed
making
this
pretty
drinkable
but
rather
a
little
boring
to
me
i
expected
outstanding
complexity
with
flavors
i
could
hardly
describe
but
it
was
rather
simple
decent
just
average
porter
flavorsaromas
but
bigger
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
id
pass
this
one
for
a
stone
smoked
porter
any
day
not
recommended
smell
is
lots
of
roasted
malt
as
well
as
dark
fruit
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
heavy
roasted
flavor
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
for
a
beer
with
this
much
alcohol
it
is
very
drinkable
and
something
i
really
enjoyed
its
a
nice
thick
beer
in
my
mouth
just
the
way
i
like
it
i
will
have
to
pick
up
some
of
this
again
d
definitely
not
a
beer
i
want
many
of
the
strong
coffee
flavors
and
super
alcohol
are
a
bit
much
but
that
is
too
be
expected
by
something
that
is
called
an
imperial
porter
so
i
cant
blame
it
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
tastes
wonderful
like
smoked
or
roasted
malts
and
a
some
potent
hops
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
nicely
probably
now
one
of
my
favorites
from
flying
dog
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
small
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
is
quite
malty
with
a
nice
robust
feel
and
slight
dryness
coffee
undertones
exist
throughout
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
quite
drinkable
and
increases
in
complexity
as
it
warms
up
this
porter
is
semithick
and
darkest
brown
smells
like
loads
of
chocolate
wafers
and
roasted
malt
taste
was
good
until
the
finish
lots
of
chocolate
and
heavy
molasses
with
a
smooth
alcohol
bite
like
a
port
wine
the
finish
was
very
earthy
and
soily
left
a
roasted
chocolate
dirt
taste
in
my
mouth
it
was
noticeable
enough
to
knock
back
an
otherwise
good
flavor
score
soil
taste
hurt
the
drinkability
score
as
skunkworks
stated
my
bottle
also
said

abv
overall
a
very
good
porter
would
recommend
and
would
have
again
d
drinkable
this
is
like
an
imperial
coffee
stout
with
a
sufficiently
diminished
coffee
replaced
by
a
more
malty
backbone
pours
oily
black
like
an
imperial
stout
with
a
tan
creamy
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
thick
lacing
behind
smell
has
a
huge
chunk
of
molasses
alcohol
coffee
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
alcohol
was
overpowering
at
first
but
blended
in
nicely
after
a
bit
tastes
of
roasted
malts
coffee
molasses
chocolate
and
some
alcohol
not
too
much
reminds
me
of
stone
ris
mouthfeel
is
moderate
bodied
a
bit
light
for
me
good
carbonation
and
the
amount
of
alcohol
bite
you
look
for
in
a
beer
like
this
a
nice
chocolate
coffee
roasty
flavor
coats
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
great
taste
i
think
this
one
would
stand
the
flavor
test
over
a
few
the
alcohol
might
overpower
it
in
a
bit
the
price
was
not
bad
probably
will
get
this
one
again
2
person
review
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
ill
drink
this
again
if
i
get
the
chance
out
of
all
of
the
flying
dog
ive
had
it
is
probably
the
best
one
definitely
a
nice
beer
can
see
why
it
wins
in
the
impy
stout
category
lots
of
roast
seemed
a
little
raw
to
me
though
a
little
one
dimensional
going
for
the
bang
rather
than
the
finesse
still
quite
enjoyed
it
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
if
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
would
smooth
this
out
at
all
d
other
than
that
initial
bittersweet
kick
in
the
teeth
this
is
pretty
drinkable
i
like
it
i
would
consider
buying
more

dangerous
i
could
definitely
see
downing
a
few
of
these
at

if
it
were
served
on
tap
around
here
overall
a
very
nice
beer
easy
to
distinguish
flavors
not
to
complex
i
like
this
beer
very
nicely
crafted
porter
that
i
will
be
buying
again
soon
especially
now
that
theyre
available
at
the
supermarket
d
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
since
the
abv
was
changed
to
7
8
im
not
sure
if
it
is
a
whole
new
recipe
but
it
is
definitely
more
balanced
than
i
remember
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
imperial
stouts
and
porters
and
this
one
is
no
disappointment
its
thick
body
makes
it
a
hearty
beer
good
for
one
or
two

would
be
overwhelming

one

that

to
keep
drinking

out
again

the

is
fairly
sweet
with
dark

and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
has
faded
from
when
this
was
fresh
mouthfeel
is
medium

full
bodied
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
that
gets
better
over
time
it
seemed
like
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
someone
dedicated
a
beer
to
hunter
thompson
fitting
that
flying
dog
did
considering
they
were
already
using
artwork
from
steadman
anyway
pours

of
dark

charcoal
dark

and
a

come
through
to
start

big
and
beefy
in
places
bitter
burnt
coffee
bean
finishes
up
the
taste
comes
off
as
pretty
heavy
in

it
definitely
rivals
a
few
imperial
stouts
out
there
great
as
a
sipper
as
lots
of
things
open
up
with
this
beer
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
one
to
seek
out
for
big
beer
and
porter
fans
my
verdict
definitely
add
this
to
your
must
try
list
md
thick
and
chewy
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
better
enjoy
this
one
at
a
slower
pace
dnot
too
drinkable
given
the
fusel
alcohols
very
much
a
sipper
and
i
would
personally
have
more
than
one
drinkability
great
beer
and
will
drink
again
i
feel
like
this
beer
used
to
be
more
fullbodied
have
they
reformulated
it
still
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
hoppy
porters
on
cask
at
rattle
and
hum
nyc
smell
of
booze
and
malt
with
some
chocolate
taste
is
very
boozy
with
sweet
malt
and
a
whole
lot
of
roastiness
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
the
alcohol
taste
gets
to
you
not
my
cup
of
tea
mouthfeel
is
slick
leaving
a
burnt
malt
alcoholic
aftertaste
poured
a
rich
dark
color
with
a
tan
head
and
zero
carbonation
e
g
nitro
the
smell
was
dominated
by
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
roasted
malts
but
once
again
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
subtle
similar
to
the
road
dog
porter
in
that
respect
the
mouth
was
nice
and
creamy
likely
due
to
the
nitro
aspect
but
one
of
these
is
a
meal
definitely
not
a
favorable
session
beer
d
better
to
sip
and
enjoy
one
rather
than
drinking
all
night
this
beer
will
shock
you
a
bit
at
first
taste
a
well
played
nod
to
its
inspiration
perhaps
but
after
the
first
one
youll
find
yourself
going
back
to
the
bar
for
more
starting
with
gorgeous
bottle
art
which
of
course
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
taste
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
to
ones
eye
it
has
a
nice
aroma
and
once
you
get
used
to
it
a
very
appealing
taste
as
well
black
with
a
decent
tan
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
muted
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
but
definitely
some
chocolatey
malts
with
coffee
and
dark
stone
fruits
underneath
flavors
are
the
same
moderately
sweet
malts
mostly
cleaned
out
by
the
hop
bitterness
underneath
and
mild
roastiness
medium
to
full
bodied
enough
carbonation
to
help
this
from
being
cloying
not
a
monster
and
not
overly
complex
but
a
nice
porter
overall
this
would
be
my
new
favourite
american
beer
as
far
as
i
can
remember
drinkability
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
its
very
good
and
very
easy
drinking
entirely
too
easy
to
put
down
a
couple
of
these
might
become
a
regular
in
my
rotation
still
good
after
two
years
of
aging
though
much
more
time
on
this
would
probably
not
serve
it
well
best
to
consume
this
one
fresh
or
within
one
year
and
with
the
latest
release
being
a
paltry
7
8
aging
probably
isnt
as
viable
still
gonzo
serves
its
namesake
well
eccentric
and
bold
in
its
younger
life
yet
still
powerful
in
its
statement
as
time
goes
by
still
highly
carbonated
but
nice
and
thick
again
almost
like
an
imperial
stout
wouldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
but
if
they
were
readily
available
i
would
buy
a
few
more
pours
black
with
a
thick
dense
tan
colored
head
that
stays
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
nice
look
to
this
beer
the
smell
is
chocolate
alcohol
a
little
dark
fruit
and
a
somewhat
smokey
wood
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
and
tangy
chocolate
and
smoky
roasted
malt
the
alcohol
is
definitely
apparent
in
the
flavor
feel
and
aftertaste
there
is
a
little
hop
in
there
also
it
finishes
with
a
little
vanilla
and
burnt
chocolately
flavors
that
are
rather
bitter
and
dry
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
more
smooth
and
creamy
but
it
has
an
ok
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
is
what
i
would
imagine
a
strong
porter
to
taste
like
would
be
a
decent
after
dinner
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
to
normally
d
would
probably
drink
this
again
5
m4
5
d
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
wonderful
the
smoothest
in
this
beer
style
that
ive
encountered
so
far
mediumplus
bodied
and
fullflavoured
it
tastes
more
like
a
67abv
robust
stoutporter
to
me
as
the
strong
alc
hides
only
too
well
at
the
back
and
the
sweet
edge
of
a
highgravity
dark
ale
reveals
only
at
a
very
late
stage
of
tasting
im
having
a
second
thought
halfway
through
tasting
now
that
in
a
sense
the
flavour
profile
is
much
milder
and
lighter
than
an
irs
and
perhaps
it
means
to
be
a
cross
between
baltic
porter
and
irs
for
its
balanced
profile
bw
bitterness
fruitiness
and
sweetness
overall
ill
never
know
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
its
definitely
my
cup
of
tea
despite
its
skyhigh
price
to
pay
in
london
as
delicious
but
light
for
a
digestif
as
it
is
rounded
and
satisfying
for
a
nightcap
nice
d
all
in
all
id
say
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
particularly
given
its
abv
a
better
nitropour
would
have
helped
in
all
areas
or
perhaps
i
would
have
been
betteroff
served
the
beer
without
the
knowledge
of
it
being
on
a
nitro
draft
system
so
this
is
the
perfect
porter
i
have
to
get
back
out
west
where
they
make
this
stuff
wow
1x
drinkability
is
decent
full
bodied
thick
and
full
of
black
malt
character
very
satisfying
and
easygoing
on
the
palate
with
a
soft
drinkability
and
a
very
pleasant
profile
baltic
porters
can
easily
get
tobe
too
sweet
for
the
black
malt
character
and
this
one
bridges
the
gap
between
too
sweet
and
too
bitter
melding
the
two
into
a
drinkable
and
tasty
porter
cheers
d
i
like
this
beer
i
just
think
its
tasty
however
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
the
older
version
a
few
times
the
one
with
a
higher
abv
and
it
was
way
better
the
older
version
where
more
potent
more
living
and
daring
and
it
had
much
more
character
its
a
shame
they
turned
it
down
a
notch
doesnt
seem
to
be
in
line
with
the
hunter
s
thompson
way
of
life
wonder
what
he
would
have
thought
about
such
rerouting
of
a
bold
departure
d
a
solid
porter
that
has
obviously
stood
the
test
of
time
it
smoothed
our
really
well
a
good
sipper
that
requires
your
full
attention
definitely
good
when
aged
my
personal
favorite
from
flying
dog
brewery
a
little
smoky
a
little
chewy
pretty
good
beer
f
finishes
with
a
dry
and
tangy
bitterness
with
some
spice
alcohol
and
stout
it
starts
lighter
than
expected
but
finishes
strong
and
dry
with
bitterness
and
spice
has
some
nice
stoutiness
in
the
middle
as
well
almost
would
have
called
this
imperial
stout
instead
of
porter
but
thats
opinionated
its
really
good
but
the
oaked
version
just
goes
over
the
top
pours
a
solid
finger
plus
head
of
dark
brown
foam
mostly
medium
to
larger
bubbles
which
may
be
why
it
dissolves
at
a
steady
pace
thick
streaks
of
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
sides
fully
black
and
opaque
no
brown
coloration
to
the
liquid
at
all
extremely
sweet
nose
drips
with
caramel
toffee
butterscotch
coffee
ice
cream
hot
chocolate
banana
pudding
plum
and
black
grape
fruit
you
name
it
its
got
it
the
nose
does
develop
some
green
hoppy
bite
but
this
is
an
after
effect
once
the
sweetness
has
congealed
a
bit
its
fullbodied
in
the
mouth
however
sheds
a
noticeable
amount
of
weight
before
it
finishes
the
carbonation
helps
break
up
some
of
the
density
in
the
chocolate
coffee
caramel
flavors
and
here
you
get
more
of
a
roasted
edge
than
in
the
nose
more
scone
baked
sweets
aspect
too
while
the
plum
cherry
grape
fruit
recedes
slightly
here
too
the
hops
surge
at
the
end
and
lend
both
bitterness
and
tingle
not
the
most
integrated
of
beers
but
it
does
smartly
emphasize
its
best
attributes
notes
i
am
not
very
impressed
by
this
beer
for
a
couple
of
reasons
first
and
foremost
that
artificially
sweetened
taste
combines
with
the
plastic
and
proves
to
be
way
too
much
for
me
to
handle
even
with
only
a
12
oz
bottle
second
there
is
not
much
complexity
or
power
to
be
found
here
flavors
are
quite
subtle
and
it
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
that
an
imperial
porter
should
have
the
mouthfeel
ends
up
being
too
heavy
and
cloying
from
all
of
the
sweets
and
it
leaves
a
really
weird
diet
sodalike
aftertaste
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
this
wasnt
anything
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
an
imperial
porter
nice
big
finish
of
sweet
coffee
that
goes
to
grapefruitresin
hops
wonderful
character
in
the
middle
and
appears
to
be
an
excellent
candidate
for
foods
with
big
flavors
a
very
drinkable
consumer
friendly
porter
stout
decent
beer
mostly
tried
it
since
it
is
in
honor
of
hunter
s
thompson
i
dont
know
if
this
would
have
been
his
beer
of
choice
though
d
despite
abv
quite
drinkable
by
far
the
best
flying
dog
that
i
have
had
hard
to
find
in
north
texas
but
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
again
slightly
above
average
for
a
plain

drinks
fairly

such
drinking
this

pours
an
extremely
dark

almost
black
color
with
lighter
brown
around
the
edges
plenty
of
thick
foam
that
fades
quickly

leaves
a
good
fingers
worth
on

of
the
beer
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
like
bready

mild
earthy

and
heavy
roasted

tastes
the
same
with
a
hint
of

cream
extremely
smooth
goes
down
very
quickly
and
easily
my
bottle
says
9
2
and
i
can
definitely
feel
it
so
sessioning
is
probably
not
in
the
picture
but
i
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
before
realizing
it
ill
just
jump
to
the
point
on
this
one
dont
let
the
smell
and
appearance
turn
you
away
this
beer
is
a
5
out
of
5
in
regards
to
taste
bold
smooth
acidic
and
roasty
sweetness
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
beer
that
has
the
gonzo
cannon
on
the
label
enough
said
had
this
beer
on
nitro
at
several
locations
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
nice
creamy
nitro
head
nose
is
loaded
with
hops
for
a
porter
and
the
taste
is
the
same
exceptional
beer
all
around
but
not
a
beer
you
can
sit
down
and
pound
many
at
once
ive
also
had
the
oak
barrel
aged
version
which
i
preferred
d
if
youre
a
porter
lover
that
wants
your
palate
kicked
into
overdrive
with
hops
then
look
no
further
good
solid
porter
overall
while
this
did
have
a
heavy
body
it
still
seemed
a
tad
lacking
in
that
area
not
at
all
watery
but
it
didnt
have
quite
the
mouthfeel
i
expect
from
a
baltic
porter
i
did
however
still
find
this
to
be
a
delicious
beer
from
flying
dog
great
flavors
and
complexity
makes
for
a
well
rounded
beer
poured
into
a
pint
size
glass
with
some
suds
lacing
on
glass
thick
mouth
feel
and
warming
alcohol
lets
you
know
this
brew
is
a
heavy
hitter
very
burnt
malty
nose
with
little
hop
flavor
despite
the
85
ibus
that
the
bottle
notes
finishing
thoughts
are
a
strong
dark
fruity
finish
this
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
but
persistent
and
creamy
head
good
aroma
full
of
coffee
cocoa
backed
by
a
nice
spicy
hoppiness
it
seemed
a
lot
stronger
at
first
right
after
the
pour
the
emphasis
in
the
taste
is
squarely
on
the
malt
and
it
stands
up
pretty
well
a
decent
roast
from
start
to
finish
together
with
a
good
coffee
flavor
bitterness
from
hops
is
high
but
theres
not
much
hop
flavor
in
here
the
yeast
profile
is
clean
letting
a
long
lingering
roastiness
after
the
finish
d
very
drinkable
at
9
2
abvor
so
my
bottle
says
different
from
the
abv
listed
here
smooth
drinking
with
nice
rich
flavors
very
enjoyable
changeup
from
the
ipadipa
kick
ive
been
on
of
late
d
i
like
it
although
the
richness
dictates
only
one
per
session
d
i
would
say
this
is
a
fantastic
american
take
on
a
baltic
or
imperial
porter
its
really
tasty
and
i
would
happily
sip
through
3
of
these
things
my
only
critique
would
be
i
thinks
its
a
bit
sweet
for
a
porter
but
i
would
say
if
you
consider
it
a
baltic
its
pretty
spot
on
that
7
8
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
a
sippable
and
enjoyable
brew
despite
its
forthright
and
irreverent
nature
it
stays
surprisingly
drinkable
but
rest
assured
theres
enough
kick
in
it
to
remind
you
that
its
still
near
the
cutting
edge
this
was
a
great
beer
very
dark
and
full
of
flavor
i
enjoyed
it
at
dinner
with
some
friends
the
smell
was
excellent
this
beer
was
in
another
world
for
me
its
a
stronger
beer
and
well
worth
the
price
you
have
to
pay
for
it
in
my
area
enjoy
it
with
a
meal
dnot
a
session
beer
for
me
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
motivate
me
to
have
another
drink
ability
is
good
not
really
sessionable
but
could
drink
acouple
of
these
at
a
time
my
first
baltic
porter
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
d
pretty
good
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
will
keep
you
stumped
picking
out
all
the
flavors
so
it
stays
interesting
ill
be
looking
for
it
again
d
it
is
somewhat
rich
and
has
a
lot
going
on
but
something
is
missing
it
needs
a
bigger
punch
flavors
are
kind
of
shallow
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
such
a
rich
flavorful
beer
smells
like
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
actually
i
wonder
what
those
smell
like
would
the
coffee
aroma
seep
through
the
coffee
even
well
anyways
thats
what
this
smells
like
along
with
some
roasty
malts
tastes
very
unique
chocolatey
and
very
bitter
the
hops
in
this
brew
were
very
well
coordinated
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
thick
drinkability
is
great
a
7oz
pony
bottle
from
the
mixed
8pack

i
wish
more
brewers
would
adoptgo
back
to
using
these
enough
with
the
fucking
high
abv
bombers
already
poured

that
very
slowly
dissipates
into
a
fine
film
around
the
glass
very
classy
looking
the
aroma
is
of
bitter
chocolate
and
slight
dried

and
roasted

wow
the
flavor
on
this
is
packed
with
striking
coffee
bitterness
chocolate
licorice
and
just
a
touch
of
smoke
and
maybe
leather
the
alcohol
has
a
lasting
warming
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
suprising
mediumbodied
and
ends
with
a
semidry
finish
classy
overall
i
am
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
while
there
is
an
obvious
presence
of
alcohol
i
would
still
drink
a
couple
of
these
throughout
an
adventurous
evening
d
a
big
flavorful
baltic
porter
from
flying
dog
one
of
their
first
beers
i
can
say
that
i
enjoyed
solidly
that
said
its
good
not
great
a
bit
shallow
and
lacking
in
complexity
ddecent
porter
nothing
noteworthy
to
add
nice
rich
brown
color
as
i
expecdted
i
got
a
whiff
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
malt
the
taste
matched
the
aroma
too
but
i
also
got
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
this
beer
had
higher
carbonation
than
a
lot
of
porters
which
for
me
is
a
good
thing
though
it
ever
so
slightly
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
especially
for
this
style
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
sure
verdict
this
is
a
very
tasty
little
porter
and
definitely
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
flying
dog
im
looking
forward
to
finding
more
porters
with
a
big
hop
presence
like
this
as
for
the
little
bottle
i
would
have
no
problem
whatsoever
with
a
full
12oz
making
the
7oz
serving
size
a
bit
of
a
tease
in
this
beers
case
pours
as
dark
as
a
moonless
night
brownish
head
which
subsides
quickly
leaving
a
2mm
thick
clingy
film
a
bit
too
much
of
toasted
malt
in
the
nose
and
taste
for
my
liking
but
the
lasting
pleasant
aftertaste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
could
become
an
acquired
taste
pours
as
i
expect
a
good
porter
to
pour
roasted
coffee
bitter
chocolate
minimal
booze
in
the
nose
mouth
is
alive
this
is
way
more
drinkable
than
i
remember
bitter
chocolate
notes
and
some
crisp
hops
coming
through
coffee
too
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
some
booze
at
the
end
that
lingers
all
around
great
porter
but
not
the
one
i
thought
i
was
buying
sweet
and
mellow
chocolate
raisin
flavor
pretty
light
not
much
alcohol
taste
at
all
especially
compared
to
the
smell
leading
this
to
be
very
drinkable
for
something
9
2abv
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thick
and
creamy
as
i
wouldve
thought
as
it
is
actually
fairly
light
i
wouldve
liked
it
to
be
a
little
more
complex
this
is
pretty
good
one
finger
tan
head
with
a
mix
of
large
and
foamy
small
bubbles
lace
sheeting
and
a
ring
very
dark
opaque
a
bright
light
reveals
active
carbonation
near
the
edges
and
just
below
the
surface
looks
promising
smell
of
chocolate
wafer
cocoa
a
bit
earthy
as
in
soil
head
easily
regenerates
taste
is
bitter
dark
chocolate
licorice
ibus
at
85
weigh
in
nicely
good
balance
with
malt
at
the
back
end
alcohol
hardly
noticeable
good
texture
smooth
and
creamy
slight
astringence
lingering
aftertaste
all
around
a
pretty
impressive
imperial
porter
for
flying
dog
brewery
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
an
excellent
baltic
porter
the
weak
scent
aroma
keep
this
from
being
a
world
class
porter
still
excellent
none
the
less
7oz
bottle
from
mixed
major
canis
pack
poured
dark
only
the
slightest
highlights
with
a
thick
brown
head
quite
lovely
some
roasted
coffee
aromas
chocolate
as
well
roasted
nutty
flavor
mmm
mmm
good
sweetness
vanilla
the
dry
nutty
flavor
is
perfect
slick
and
viscous
but
still
has
good
body
to
it
good
beer
to
swish
around
a
really
good
porter
terrific
sipper
my
favorite
flying
dog
release
so
far
seven
ounces
is
a
good
serving
size
for
this
one
even
though
lets
be
honest
i
will
probably
have
another
one
d
very
nice
i
liked
it
and
may
buy
it
again
still
my
fav
is
harpoon
baltic
porter
mfd
full
body
decent
carbonation
goes
down
a
little
lessthansmooth
but
still
enjoyable
d
honestly
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
have
it
was
a
good
beer
but
a
little
low
toward
the
drinkability
scale
d
very
drinkable
but
probably
not
in
a
long
session
due
to
both
the
heaviness
and
also
the
high
abv
easy
drinking
baltic
porter
with
definite
character
and
easily
the
coolest
ralph
steadman
artwork
for
flying
dog
kinda
disappointed
here
the
abv
should
give
way
more
flavor
ad
body
than
this
the
beer
was
kinda
1
5
dimensional
while
better
than
most
the
flavor
and
aroma
was
a
let
down
d
at
10
for
a
4
pack
the
drinkability
is
lower
than
most
because
i
would
rather
pay
7
99
for
the
sierra
nevada
porter
and
get
6
bottles
instead
of
4
probably
the
last
time
i
purchase
this
beer
just
because
there
are
so
many
others
out
there
to
try
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
i
need
to
watch
what
i
spend
10
on
these
days
drinkability
all
in
all
its
pretty
solid
and
worth
drinking
and
enjoying
the
balance
of
the
flavors
wasnt
there
for
me
so
it
didnt
necessarily
grab
my
attention
like
some
other
beers
have
d
a
decent
quite
tasty
porter
not
something
id
drink
often
but
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
i
really
didnt
like
the
barleywine
that
flying
dog
was
so
i
wasnt
too
sure
about
this
one
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
it
tastes
nothing
like
it
smells
smooth
and
roasty
with
a
chocolatey
overtone
not
bitter
chocolate
but
smooth
chocolate
hops
stay
in
the
back
ground
only
become
at
least
a
little
prominent
for
the
endpalate
as
a
cleanser
off
of
the
sweet
roastiness
a
little
coating
almost
but
not
quite
medicinal
certainly
leaves
its
impression
on
the
palate
not
real
watery
but
not
a
great
mouthfeel
impression
either
drinkability
is
much
higher
than
antiicpated
not
overly
bitter
or
alcoholic
at
all
a
nice
surprising
way
to
end
a
night
just
very
one
dimensional
if
you
like
that
dimension
you
will
be
happy
but
there
isnt
much
depth
here
d
a
nice
beer
for
review
number
400
id
actually
forgotten
i
had
this
in
the
cellar
it
was
a
nice
surprise
to
rediscover
gonzo
is
a
good
nightcap
beer
that
i
heartily
recommend
the
beer
ranks
right
up
with
flying
dogs
excellent
barley
wine
for
me
taste
is
roasty
and
bitter
very
coffee
like
without
much
actual
coffee
flavor
dark
fruits
are
plenty
evident
as
well
as
a
bit
of
green
apple
and
dark
chocolate
this
is
a
robust
porter
with
a
dangerously
smooth
level
of
drinkability
abv
is
hidden
well
especially
after
aging
a
few
months
has
a
full
mouthfeel
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
carbonation
reins
in
at
modest
levels
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
and
there
are
not
many
high
abv
porters
that
can
beat
it
overall
it
doesnt
draw
me
back
for
more
and
i
doubt
id
buy
it
again
very
well
balanced
and
fullbodied
this
beer
manages
to
be
roasty
and
fruity
and
hoppy
all
at
once
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
although
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
because
of
the
heavy
mouthfeel
other
than
that
its
just
a
strong
robust
porter
this
beer
has
more
in
common
with
rogues
mocha
porter
and
anchor
porter
than
anything
from
the
baltic
i
vote
it
should
be
reclassed
as
an
american
porter
maybe
this
recipe
was
a
good
marketing
decision
by
flying
dog
as
so
many
craft
beer
fans
are
hopheads
me
id
like
something
maltier
richer
and
more
interesting
d
a
sipper
and
one
was
enough
for
me
this
is
a
night
time
beer
for
me
and
im
looking
to
find
some
aged
bottles
as
this
one
may
have
some
legs
on
it
cant
wait
for
the
next
one
d
a
fairly
rich
porter
good
for
sipping
not
for
chugging
not
my
favorite
baltic
porter
but
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
d
could
go
through
the
4
pack
without
much
trouble
at
all
very
enjoyable
poured
very
blackbrown
almost
oily
looking
kinda
evil
has
some
strong
charcoal
scents
coming
out
of
it
yummy
hops
strong
alcohol
also
strong
flavors
of
coffee
and
toffe
right
away
then
soem
burnt
toast
hops
linger
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
really
enjoyable
almost
oily
mouthfeel
not
a
huge
fan
of
that
despite
the
less
than
amazing
mouthfeel
i
drink
lots
of
these
gosh
this
is
good
i
love
this
brewery
this
beer
is
a
great
flavor
example
and
has
great
aspects
outside
of
the
flavor
itself
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
big
and
frothy
and
plenty
of
lace
smell
is
lacking
hops
present
taste
is
big
hoppy
with
roasted
malt
notes
i
was
surprised
because
im
used
to
porters
putting
malt
at
the
forefront
this
is
much
more
hoppy
than
malty
the
mouthfeel
like
the
smell
is
lacking
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
one
was
i
find
flying
dog
to
be
quite
overrated
so
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
also
give
this
one
extra
points
for
taste
because
its
a
porter
that
i
actually
like
the
only
other
example
of
the
style
i
can
truly
enjoy
being
fullers
london
porter
i
like
that
flying
dog
chose
to
make
their
best
beer
imo
a
tribute
to
hunter
thompson
very
creamy
full
mouthfeel
smooth
drinker
alcohol
is
pretty
much
undetectable
ill
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
this
year
to
see
how
much
this
one
mellowed
out
should
probably
be
a
slow
sipper
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
i
recently
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
dark
knight
returns
as
a
result
my
par
for
baltic
porters
rose
dramatically
i
have
since
had
several
that
were
a
downright
disappointment
this
one
however
holds
up
very
well
i
drank
the
first
one
and
immediately
poured
the
second
the
second
had
sat
on
the
counter
during
the
first
to
warm
it
a
little
and
this
only
made
the
experience
better
the
flavors
and
scents
were
stronger
my
brotherinlaw
wants
to
trade
something
he
has
for
one
of
them
and
im
going
to
age
the
last
to
see
if
it
ages
nicely
served
in
a
pint
glass
at
the
gastro
pub
bouzy
the
appearance
is
very
dark
like
molasses
with
a
thin
tan
head
it
is
thick
and
leaves
legs
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
and
figgy
with
hints
of
esspresso
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
feel
are
what
would
be
expected
thicker
sweet
and
toasty
malty
followed
by
slight
hoppiness
to
round
it
out
this
is
a
solid
porter
and
i
will
drink
it
again
the
american
micro
brewers
have
taken
just
about
every
traditional
old
world
style
now
doubled
it
smacked
it
with
a
double
or
imperial
moniker
and
reclaimed
it
as
their
own
in
some
cases
theyve
misunderstood
the
nature
of
the
style
saison
german
lagers
but
in
others
stout
ipas
and
evidently
porters
theyve
created
something
masterful
yum
i
can
now
honestly
say
i
have
a
beer
that
i
will
fight
for
over
the
last
few
months
i
have
been
having
one
or
two
on
a
whim
and
then
about
two
weeks
ago
it
suddenly
hit
me
this
may
just
be
one
of
the
greatest
beers
ever
brewed
i
would
be
willing
to
rank
it
up
there
with
chimay
grande
reserve
or
gulden
draak
a
nicely
chilled
12
oz
bottle
went
into
my
riedel
snifter
which
is
the
old
standard
bearer
for
all
my
reviews
the
head
was
about
a
half
inch
thick
almost
as
smooth
as
chocolate
frosting
the
color
was
jet
black
allowing
no
light
to
breach
its
darkness
the
aroma
was
full
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
sweet
dark
fruits
the
taste
wasnt
as
strong
as
an
imperial
stout
but
very
well
defined
and
rich
there
was
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
what
im
guessing
would
be
honey
because
molasses
would
be
too
heavy
i
even
see
on
the
back
where
its
got
a
vintage
date
of
2008
i
would
love
to
age
a
few
bottles
and
see
how
well
it
ages
smells
of
fruity
esthers
maybe
cherry
and
chocolate
taste
is
similar
this
is
a
big
beer
very
dry
finish
maybe
some
honey
or
molasses
in
there
and
a
bunch
of
chocolate
and
coffee
cocoa
maybe
this
is
no
session
beer
one
and
done
but
certainly
a
fine
beer
very
creative
pours
black
with
a
thick
frothy
light
brown
head
that
leaves
lace
rings
and
slowly
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
i
could
smell
this
one
as
soon
as
i
started
pouring
roasted
malt
chocolate
mild
hops
and
a
little
earthiness
especially
as
it
warmed
up
nice
rich
initial
flavor
a
little
sweet
roasted
and
burnt
malt
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
a
nicely
balanced
bitter
hops
and
roasted
malt
aftertaste
that
is
pleasantly
lingering
full
bodied
well
carbonated
smooth
but
not
really
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
just
what
i
want
this
is
a
really
solid
porter
that
is
great
to
sip
as
it
warms
up
i
did
not
find
the
alcohol
to
be
overwhelming
at
all
it
is
there
but
not
dominant
nice
job
with
this
one
like
this
stuff
everybody
should
try
this
at
least
once
overall
i
enjoyed
this
not
the
best
impy
porter
but
one
that
is
readily
available
and
one
i
would
try
again
i
admit
being
skewed
by
the
fact
that
baltic
porters
are
not
really
my
thing
but
i
can
confidently
say
i
have
had
some
that
are
far
better
d
strong
and
complex
with
lots
of
flavor
and
a
very
pleasamt
mouthfeel
gonzo
drank
more
like
a
ris
in
my
opinion
pours
a
five
finger
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
totally
black
color
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
nose
light
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
flavor
is
semisweet
chocolate

superette
manchester
nh
beer
is
very
opaque
about
three
fingers
of
dark
brown
fluffy
head
very
good
lacing
looks
enticing
smells
are
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
bitter
dark
chocolate
maybe
a
hint
of
fruit
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
taset
is
very
roasted
a
lot
of
depth
and
character
to
this
one
it
seems
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
concealed
pretty
well
in
this
beer
i
was
surprised
very
smooth
and
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
porter
in
my
opinion
drinkability
pretty
good
if
interesting
porter
the
sweetness
and
strong
alcohol
taste
through
it
slightly
off
balance
but
something
decent
to
try
d
pretty
big
beer
for
a
porter
almost
chunky
and
gritty
imperial
is
an
accurate
word
to
describe
this
beer
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
thick
which
makes
the
drink
ability
a
bit
hard
but
a
small
sacrifice
to
make
for
such
big
flavor
d
i
could
do
a
good
few
of
these
delicious
and
perfect
for
sitting
around
a
fire
on
a
nice
summer
night
i
have
passed
by
this
one
several
times
but
will
be
sure
to
grab
some
from
now
on
overall
a
very
good
brew
easy
drinking
and
filling
definitely
something
to
sip
on
and
relax
with
d
alcohol
is
not
an
issue
with
this
at
all
it
goes
down
very
easily
almost
a
little
too
much
so
for
the
content
this
brewery
wasnt
among
my
favourites
before
but
this
one
stands
out
and
has
me
interested
in
revisiting
others
nicely
done

notes
i
realize
that
this
is
a
baltic
porter
but
to
me
it
is
very
much
a
stout
i
may
need
to
look
up
the
definitions
of
both
to
understand
the
difference
i
guess
d
ok
this
is
a
tasty
enjoyable
beer
when
cold
but
when
warm
it
is
a
flat
syrupy
thing
i
dont
much
care
for
ill
finish
the
fourpack
but
i
doubt
i
will
hurry
to
buy
more
thompson
or
no
thompson
since
the
alcohol
has
been
lowered
to
7
8
abv
i
thought
i
would
add
that
i
could
not
taste
any
major
differences
in
the
beer
other
than
it
all
around
seemed
sweeter
than
the
9
8
abv
that
i
had
tasted
before
the
difference
in
taste
could
have
to
do
entirely
with
how
old
the
9
8
abv
had
been
i
still
love
the
beer
after
losing
2
abv
d
i
could
drink
this
as
a
nightcap
but
theres
several
others
id
prefer
d
when
in
the
mood
could
sip
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
poured
into
a
pint
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
is
quickly
gone
the
smell
is
of
burnt
coffee
and
rich
figs
those
two
themes
carry
over
to
the
taste
which
also
adds
dark
molasses
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
to
a
thick
and
rich
mouthfilling
feel
the
coffee
and
sweetness
both
dark
and
deep
linger
afterwards
with
a
roasted
fullness
that
is
not
overpowering
a
full
and
warming
drinking
experience
that
is
not
too
filling
or
to
bitter
perfect
on
a
cold
winter
evening
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
imperial
porter
it
has
a
big
juicy
fruit
note
in
between
the
typical
chocolate
and
coffee
im
sure
ill
drink
this
again
sometime
drinkability
its
certainly
one
of
flying
dogs
better
offerings
paired
well
with
the
bittersweet
oft
melancholy
tones
of
the
kings
of
convenience
and
pedro
the
lion
it
makes
me
a
bit
wistful
for
the
barrelaged
gonzo
poured
motor
oil
black
nice
2
finger
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quick
smells
wonderful
of
the
roasted
malts
can
taste
the
hops
not
bitter
at
all
taste
of
dark
malt
and
really
picking
up
a
chocolate
coffee
flavor
finish
a
bit
stout
due
to
the
alcohol
bite
but
is
by
no
means
overwhelming
wonderfully
flavorful
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
have
to
get
again
d
not
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
pour
it
into
your
glass
straight
from
the
refrigerator
and
drink
it
slowly
so
you
get
the
spectrum
of
tastes
and
aromas
d
that
alcohol
taste
warmed
me
up
as
it
went
down
and
the
coffee
aftertaste
was
wonderful
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
clearly
a
flying
dog
version
of
a
porter
mouthfeel
taste
stays
in
mouth
for
a
nice
long
drink
a
beer
that
would
last
me
throughout
dinner
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
large
rocky
head
smells
sickly
sweet
as
soon
as
i
open
the
bottle
its
hard
to
get
past
that
smell
the
overly
sweet
malty
aroma
smells
like
something
from
rogue
in
the
xs
line
taste
is
a
little
bland
after
that
bit
scent
thin
bodied
a
little
lackluster
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
but
this
beer
is
lacking
something
overall
very
very
good
porter
nice
balance
of
flavor
that
isnt
too
strong
in
any
area
and
still
provides
great
drinkability
for
the
alcohol
content
picked
up
a
4
pack
at
bevmo
as
i
saw
the
label
in
an
ad
or
something
and
thought
i
must
give
it
a
shot
this
poured
as
a
nice
dark
midnight
with
a
minimal
head
smelled
of
dark
chocolate
and
small
hints
of
coffee
you
could
also
get
some
of
the
hoppy
smell
which
is
different
from
deep
porters
or
stouts
great
taste
i
initially
thought
it
to
be
more
of
a
stout
due
to
the
low
bubbles
it
definitely
dint
represent
the
typical
porter
carbonation
very
smooth
and
tastes
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolates
throughout
to
me
it
was
more
of
a
stout
but
loved
every
sip
excited
to
have
another
tonight
d
very
awesome
porter
here
probably
the
best
ive
had
so
far
not
really
a
baltic
porter
but
a
american
imperial
porter
color
is
very
black
with
a
large
tan
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
with
some
hop
background
still
coming
through
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
and
strong
bitter
dark
chocolate
with
some
coffee
notes
really
well
balanced
for
a
strong
beer
and
it
masks
the
alcohol
well
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
by
a
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
inspired
by
hunter
s
thompson
brew
was
an
opaque
black
color
through
which
not
even
sunlight
would
pass
with
a
thin
brown
head
the
retention
was
poor
but
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
the
aroma
was
rich
sweet
malt
milk
and
dark
chocolate
toffee
and
hints
of
coffee
the
flavors
were
at
first
quite
sweet
as
well
with
caramel
toffee
and
chocolate
as
well
as
some
alc
esters
that
appeared
as
it
heated
up
roasted
malt
coffee
and
bitter
hoppiness
came
forward
towards
the
end
the
coffee
especially
on
the
long
finish
the
alcohol
heat
was
well
concealed
and
the
effect
was
generally
complex
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
my
only
complaint
was
it
was
just
a
little
bit
oily
still
as
solid
example
of
the
imperialbaltic
porter
an
absolute
wonderful
beer
not
sure
if
this
is
really
a
porter
or
stout
huge
flavors
of
roasted
coffee
chocolate
with
just
a
little
dark
fruit
to
cut
through
it
the
flavors
and
aroma
in
this
beer
are
the
best
of
any
porter
ive
ever
had
an
incredible
brew
i
love
it
when
light
cant
make
it
through
the
glass
and
the
creamy
head
crowns
the
beverage
like
it
is
royalty
the
aroma
is
rich
and
sweet
just
like
its
flavor
every
sip
was
greeted
with
a
syrupy
complex
mouthfeel
this
porter
seems
to
be
just
right
keeping
up
with
a
great
imperial
crowd
this
beer
had
the
balls
to
to
a
little
strong
but
flavorful
at
the
same
time
it
was
just
the
right
mix
of
malt
flavor
and
tasty
coffee
undertone
that
made
me
do
a
double
take
pretty
darn
good
wow
this
stuff
is
awesome
and
lives
up
to
all
the
hype
absolutely
delicuous
one
hell
of
a
dark
hoppy
complex
surprise
its
a
full
bodied
beer
that
i
very
much
enjoy
ill
be
drinking
this
again
soon
but
its
not
a
beer
that
i
would
add
to
regular
rotation
overall
a
wonderful
brew
very
drinkable
and
something
that
despite
the
higherthannormal
alcohol
content
you
could
drink
a
few
of
in
one
night
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
and
i
will
continue
to
go
back
to
it
for
a
great
porter
very
drinkable
good
for
sipping
so
you
can
enjoy
the
flavor
too
bad
i
can
only
find
the
12
oz
bottle
they
dont
make
40s
of
this
stuff
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
but
im
impressed
when
i
cracked
open
this
it
poured
a
beautiful
dark
into
my
waiting
glass
the
aroma
coming
from
the
glass
was
that
of
almost
an
ipa
and
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
slightly
woody
aftertaste
i
could
have
easily
knocked
back
three
or
four
of
these
on
a
given
night
this
beer
pours
a
deep
opaque
brown
boardering
on
black
there
is
a
thin
brown
head
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
scent
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
toffee
coffee
and
a
slightly
hoppy
smell
in
it
the
big
abv
comes
through
pretty
clearly
taste
is
rich
with
the
same
chocolate
and
toffee
roasted
flavors
and
it
finishes
in
a
big
hit
of
alcohol
there
is
bitterness
on
the
back
end
as
well
but
the
roasty
aftertaste
is
pleasant
enough
the
alcohol
could
be
a
little
less
dominant
as
it
becomes
more
and
more
apparent
throughout
the
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
but
the
overpowering
alcohol
flavor
deters
me
from
making
this
a
beer
to
sit
with
for
an
evening
d
i
think
one
per
session
is
enough
on
this
one
it
is
tasty
and
there
are
a
lot
of
things
going
on
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
lots
of
interesting
things
going
on
though
good
beer
and
a
worthy
tribute
as
it
is
kinda
weird
and
definitely
out
there
bottle
pours
a
14inch
head
of
tan
nice
black
thick
beer
roast
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
come
through
the
aroma
all
fairly
light
this
is
a
lovely
balance
of
roasty
dark
flavors
balanced
with
the
sweetness
of
the
porter
most
of
the
time
i
dont
enjoy
porters
as
they
are
too
sweet
and
not
proportioned
well
against
the
roast
malt
this
is
an
excelent
beer
there
is
just
a
hint
of
hot
liquor
on
the
throat
as
it
warmed
the
sweet
hot
liquor
and
some
of
the
roast
went
away
making
this
exceedingly
drinkable
for
7ish
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
midnight
black
in
color
with
nice
caramel
one
finger
head
brilliant
aroma
scheme
that
provides
roast
coffee
chocolate
and
the
perfect
blazed
malt
gulp
nice
mouthful
intake
of
robust
charcoal
with
overtones
of
some
berry
fruits
lacing
is
remarkable
a
great
beer
to
end
a
session
ranks
in
my
top
5
of
night
cap
beers
will
drink
again
and
recommend
to
close
friends
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
watery
with
too
much
carbonation
im
currently
drinking
gonzo
and
pouring
a
generous
amount
into
a
simmering
pot
of
bison
chili
from
time
to
time
being
such
a
large
bold
kick
you
in
the
face
kind
of
beverage
i
would
recommend
serving
gonzo
porter
with
game
meats
like
venison
or
ostrich
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
beer
in
the
future
perhaps
with
my
attorney
at
100
mph
in
a
cherry
red
cadillac
through
the
desert
d
this
is
a
solid
porter
i
know
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
is
high
but
not
too
high
compared
to
some
others
but
it
felt
really
boozy
for
some
reason
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
too
many
in
one
sitting
though
its
worth
checking
out
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
like
porters
and
i
like
ipas
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
to
combine
the
two
i
will
buy
more
when
i
find
it
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
it
was
poured
with
no
head
this
beer
smelled
like
coconut
and
alcohol
very
weird
it
tasted
similar
to
the
smell
it
did
not
taste
like
any
other
porter
i
have
ever
had
it
was
somewhat
sweet
and
kind
of
hoppy
the
only
thing
i
can
compare
the
taste
to
would
be
bailys
irish
cream
except
not
as
good
it
felt
syrupy
in
my
mouth
i
was
really
excited
about
trying
this
beer
and
it
was
a
total
let
down
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
was
odd
not
what
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
very
surprised
havent
been
impressed
with
any
flying
dogs
but
this
one
was
very
good
a
monster
porter
not
sure
id
call
it
baltic
it
has
the
mouthfeel
though
not
the
sugar
but
id
definitely
drink
it
fantastic
dark
brown
almost
black
pour
with
a
dark
brown
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
hops
coffee
plumb
brown
sugar
bitter
predominates
but
lets
plenty
of
other
complexity
through
coffee
and
caramel
are
the
major
notes
smooth
feel
and
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
warming
finish
this
beer
took
me
completely
by
surprise
it
pours
as
thick
and
as
black
as
crude
oil
with
a
substantial
head
that
has
no
intention
of
fleeing
the
the
glass
tastes
like
a
forest
fire
in
that
it
has
a
burnt
maltiness
backed
with
shockingly
strong
piney
hops
a
very
heavy
body
that
is
infinitely
swishable
in
your
mouth
and
extremely
creamy
this
beer
is
truly
fascinating
pours
an
oily
pitch
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
smell
is
of
roasted
grain
and
molasses
taste
is
of
coffee
black
liquorice
and
a
medium
malt
base
a
touch
sour
in
the
finish
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
as
well
medium
bitterness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
low
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
though
i
think
a
12oz
bottle
is
enough
for
one
sitting
tastes
similar
to
a
russian
imperial
stout
though
a
bit
dryer
imo
a
good
beer
i
would
buy
again
ddecent
but
not
first
choice
for
this
style
a
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
oh
how
i
love
it
so
i
like
this
beer
seems
pretty
stout
for
a
porter
but
since
its
gonzo
it
fits
the
bill
no
sunlight
in
the
body
as
hunter
would
have
wanted
it
dirty
brown
head
dissolves
to
a
ring
of
grey
bubbles
in
a
maudite
sniftera
devilish
way
to
begin
advent
rich
thick
fragrant
bouquet
of
sweet
molasses
chocolate
and
pleasant
hopsa
fullbodied
aroma
heavy
body
that
drapes
around
the
tongue
like
a
pallor
or
a
shroudthick
yet
smoothwarming
and
immense
in
presence
the
alcohol
makes
itself
aware
late
with
a
linger
rich
yeasty
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
peat
and
breadnot
smoky
per
se
but
thick
with
something
dark
having
saved
this
for
the
last
of
the
fd
sampler
i
am
bowled
over
by
this
beers
drinkability
miller
lite
is
harsher
than
the

abv
this
beer
sportsand
its
enjoyable
complexity
it
almost
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
thomspons
writings
to
find
out
what
the
big
fuss
was
about
cheers
a
good
all
around
porter
just
wish
i
was
near
a
fire
on
a
cold
night
2008

abv
i
want
to
review
this
beer
before
only
the
lower
abv
version
is
available
it
seems
this
beer
is
going
down
a
bit
in
strength
which
im
not
overtly
opposed
to
but
i
fear
any
change
to
this
wonderful
porter
its
thick
and
chewy
almost
like
a
great
stout
its
in
a
slightly
easier
categories
than
the
stouts
and
its
scores
reflect
this
to
a
modest
extent
the
beer
pours
deep
and
dark
with
slight
highlights
on
the
edges
and
a
mocha
head
the
smell
is
tiny
bit
weak
or
maybe
dipas
have
utterly
spoiled
me
there
are
some
notes
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
ashy
its
a
very
good
caramel
wood
ash
flavor
which
doesnt
sound
great
but
comes
off
fairly
dry
for
such
a
big
porter
it
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
craft
beers
for
a
long
time
i
love
how
well
flying
dog
got
such
a
big
strong
beer
distributed
so
widely
the
hop
bite
in
the
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
this
beer
has
a
very
round
flavor
and
full
mouthfeel
that
compliments
the
malt
notes
nearly
perfectly
also
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
for
a
big
porter
this
beer
has
made
me
seek
out
other
big
porters
like
sinebrychoff
zywiec
and
carnegie
its
a
great
introduction
to
big
tasty
porters
for
american
beer
fans
without
this
beer
i
would
not
have
readily
bought
these
randomsounding
porters
from
finland
poland
and
sweden
so
much
attention
is
paid
to
big
stouts
while
big
porters
languish
in
relative
obscurity
its
fairly
confusing
asked
if
she
could
have
another
mom
said
yeah
i
could
agreed
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
poured
a
deep
black
color
with
a
small
brown
head
that
dissapated
quickly
aroma
of
chocolate
black
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
with
chocolate
hints
the
bitter
taste
lingered
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
for
a
while
you
get
a
little
of
the
alcohol
flavor
at
the
end
it
was
very
pleasant
much
better
than
expected
slight
warming
alcohol
presence
in
the
background
that
does
not
dominate
the
brew
right
in
in
the
middle
of
not
being
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
overall
highly
drinkable
and
something
i
would
not
mind
having
again
drinkabilitythe
hops
keep
it
refreshing
so
the
sugaryness
doesnt
become
overwhelming
very
balanced
overall
if
not
for
the
high
abv
perhaps
this
would
be
sessionable
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
covering
the
alcohol
burn
from
the
palette
as
i
was
only
able
to
feel
it
after
i
had
already
taken
a
sip
while
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
thickness
to
it
it
was
still
a
pretty
good
feeling
beer
overall
looks
good
and
black
with
a
nice
creamy
head
smells
hoppy
as
hell
unlike
any
porter
i
have
ever
had
before
nice
and
citrusy
and
floral
scents
dominate
taste
matches
the
smell
as
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
the
porters
i
am
used
to
mouth
is
thin
and
carbonated
with
quote
a
zing
to
it
i
would
session
with
this
in
a
second
tastes
really
good
of
those
earlier
mentioned
hardly
roasted
malts
vanilla
fudge
some
light
coffee
notes
that
reminds
me
of
zoegas
blue
java
and
finally
a
strong
background
of
american
hops
its
a
really
filling
beer
that
is
a
good
sipper

i

the

taste

d
this

just
couldnt
find

no
means
bad
it
just
seemed
like
a
tangled
mess
of
styles
that
confused
my
palate
the
ris
flavors
made
me
think
the
beer
was
too
thin
but
being
a
porter
the
relative
thinness
of
the
body
was
actually
fine
im
torn
to
say
the
least
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
ruby
on
the
outer
edges
large
fluffy
mocha
head
leaves
lace
all
over
aroma
holy
hops
i
could
smell
them
in
the
pour
pine
and
grapefruit
lathered
in
chocolate
and
roast
sounds
bad
but
smells
good
taste
is
roasty
chocolaty
even
little
bit
of
ash
especially
in
the
finishaftertaste
the
hops
are
there
but
not
as
up
front
as
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
surprisingly
balanced
for
85
ibus
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
creamy
body
is
a
little
thin
carbonation
is
light
but
appropriate
great
baltic
porter
definitely
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
flying
dog
everything
good
in
a
porter
but
with
the
benefits
of
a
strong
ale
being
the
alcohol
and
the
bite
a
clean
kick
of
hops
im
guessing
this
is
dry
hopped
solid
version
okay
one
more
shot
with
flying
dog
this
is
actually
really
good
nearly
black
pour
with
brown
edges
short
tan
head
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
aroma
mixed
with
smoke
and
burning
rubber
huge
taste
lots
of
coffee
and
chococlate
again
but
mixed
with
a
generous
amount
of
hops
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
coffee
and
crystal
malt
is
excellent
but
somehow
kept
balanced
with
a
sweet
back
tasty
another
great
beer
from
flying
dog
im
officially
a
fan
a
delightful
porter
from
flying
dog
rich
and
bold
of
course
but
smooth
and
very
likable
sort
of
reminds
me
of
hunter
s
thompson
himself
in
some
ways
this
one
will
satisfy
maltier
porter
lovers
as
well
as
hopheads
because
it
keeps
it
balanced
and
firing
from
both
ends
one
of
the
best
indulgent
porters
ive
ever
had
great
taste
is
thick
and
smooth
milk
and
bitter
chocolate
toasted
walnuts
graham
cracker
licorice
hiding
in
the
back
a
touch
of
vanilla
end
is
nicely
bitter
and
dry
thick
oily
nice
carbonation
but
could
use
less
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
but
this
is
one
thick
bastard
this
is
the
best
beer
flying
dog
makes
but
that
doesnt
say
much
about
their
other
beers
this
one
is
good
but
just
shy
of
great
future
outlook
out
of
sight
brew
imo
i
will
definitely
be
buying
again
and
am
glad
to
have
the
rest
of
my
4
pack
to
dispose
of
this
beer
was
amazing
i
bought
the
canis
major
four
pack
all
of
the
beers
in
it
were
delicious
but
this
one
stood
out
it
was
by
far
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
also
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
is
amazing
flying
dog
set
a
new
standard
for
bottle
art
by
hiring
ralph
steadman
i
wasnt
that
big
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
flavors
were
everywhere
and
the
alcohol
was
still
quite
hot
for
me
d
for
me
it
is
not
there
i
bought
this
one
as
a
single
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
get
it
again
maybe
later
as
my
tastes
better
develops
as
i
am
still
very
new
to
beer
i
may
have
jumped
in
to
this
one
too
soon
i
know
for
sure
i
could
not
drink
more
than
this
one
in
a
single
sitting
drinkability
no
more
than
2
at
once
and
maybe
thats
pushing
it
however
its
not
hard
to
finish
a
beer
at
all
drinkable
better
warmed
a
little
bit
will
try
this
one
again
with
a
little
fresher
bottle
d
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
pours
black
with
one
inch
of
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
thick
cap
a
lot
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
surface
the
aroma
conists
of
roasted
mildly
burnt
malt
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
nicely
covered
up
in
the
aroma
and
taste
even
though
it
is
up
close
to
the
10
mark
the
flavor
is
good
but
rather
one
dimensional
the
malt
comes
through
but
it
just
leaves
a
slightly
burnt
bitterness
that
lasts
through
the
finish
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
combines
for
a
nice
texture
for
a
malty
high
abv
beer
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
more
than
one
a
sitting
but
it
is
good
for
the
style
d
let
this
one
warm
up
really
nice
after
20
minutes
from
the
fridge
a
fast
sipper
id
call
it
dont
really
need
to
take
forever
to
drink
this
but
i
wouldnt
rush
it
either
boy
this
is
really
really
good
towards
the
end
id
drink
this
only
slightly
cold
next
time
around
really
nice
dthis
is
a
nice
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
the
alcohol
content
a
very
good
beer
to
keep
me
warm
on
a
chilly
latenovember
evening
i
look
forward
to
having
this
one
again
d
for
being
so
big
it
actually
drinks
pretty
easily
additionally
the
high
abv
didnt
factor
into
the
flavor
at
all
for
me
which
is
always
a
plus
ill
definitely
be
seeking
out
this
beer
again
in
the
future
feel
is
what
i
would
expect
thicker
than
what
i
associate
with
a
baltic
but
totally
within
style
nice
and
creamy
carbonation
is
prickly
and
doesnt
allow
the
heavy
flavors
to
get
boring
i
could
have
another
but
need
to
switch
after
that
d
deceivingly
easy
to
drink
the
high
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
the
malty
flavors
arent
overbearing
in
the
category
of
a
high
abv
porter
this
works
for
me
got
this
at
the
second
antioktoberfest
on
tap
next
to
the
tire
bite
what
a
contrast
this
beer
is
exceptionally
good
and
unique
for
the
style
of
porters
first
off
it
is
an
imperial
porter
making
it
obviously
more
thick
and
rich
and
more
alcoholic
tasting
in
the
overall
profile
secondly
it
has
a
unique
hoppyfloral
note
lacing
the
more
typical
roasted
chocolaty
malty
and
mocha
this
is
the
most
impressive
part
of
the
beer
its
hoppy
sweet
floral
notes
and
slight
bitter
hints
really
make
this
normally
dark
beer
far
more
crisp
tasting
i
really
love
this
beer
but
recommend
you
have
it
in
smaller
dosage
just
because
of
the
robust
character
and
really
thick
mouthfeel
not
something
youd
sit
around
and
drink
a
case
of
but
a
nice
beer
either
way
d
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
it
again
though
a
little
too
much
for
my
blood
big
beer
the
9
is
distinct
warming
2
in
a
sitting
is
enough
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
while
pouring
this
beer
looks
like
dirty
used
motor
oil
the
beer
is
dark
and
impervious
to
any
light
a
thin
tan
head
forms
making
this
beer
look
alot
like
a
ris
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
of
this
beer
there
are
hints
of
coffee
caramel
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
chocolate
toffee
and
coffee
are
all
flavors
i
pick
up
along
with
some
hints
of
overripe
fruit
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
sipper
the
beer
hides
its
9
abv
very
well
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
thick
chewy
and
dry
feel
this
drink
s
strong
but
really
very
nice
its
a
combination
of
sweet
but
also
roasted
dark
malts
3
5
d
very
good
beer
but
one
would
be
plenty
big
flavor
and
filling
and
complete
the
main
problem
is
that
its
too
sweet
to
drink
any
more
of
nevertheless
i
have
tasted
more
complex
and
more
satifying
porters
dark
brownblack
with
tan
foam
and
no
light
shining
through
foam
is
gone
in
a
few
second
leaving
behind
some
average
lacing
aroma
of
bitter
roasted
malts
booze
and
slightly
hoppy
flavor
follows
suit
bitter
roasted
malt
slightly
chocolaty
some
coffee
notes
and
nice
dry
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
average
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
a
bit
strong
to
drink
too
many
in
one
sitting
but
a
nice
bottle
to
have
around
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
very
full
bodied
drinkability
is
not
the
greatest
because
this
a
pretty
big
beer
but
its
not
bad
either
im
very
glad
i
got
a
hold
of
this
one
highly
recommended
we
believe
they
changed
this
recipe
it
used
to
be
much
better
i
will
say
i
was
impressed
this
is
the
first
imperial
porter
ive
had
although
i
find
it
to
be
in
a
gray
area
between
a
stout
and
a
porter
leaning
for
towards
the
stout
side
needless
to
say
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
and
other
beers
of
its
kind
serving
type
112oz
bottle
er
12oz
bottle
im
really
feeling
the
alcohol
now
best
flying
dog
ive
had
to
date
comes
with
a
strong
reccomendation
i
am
not
a
big
porter
guy
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
ever
had
poured
murky
black
into
a
nice
8
oz
glass
with
a
finger
level
tan
head
and
minimal
lace
smells
of
malts
and
mild
hops
with
a
vague
aroma
of
smoke
goes
down
really
easy
its
a
mix
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
very
creamy
finish
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
rounds
this
out
but
is
evident
much
more
towards
the
middle
of
beer
than
any
other
time
it
seemed
overall
a
nice
baltic
porter
but
the
abv
would
make
it
tough
to
be
a
session
beer
enjoyable
for
one
or
two
though
a
much
better
brew
than
their
road
dog
porter
the
two
dont
even
seem
to
be
related
actually
one
id
definitely
revisit
overall
still
very
good
2
years
in
the
cellar
caused
its
robustness
to
fade
a
little
but
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
very
recommended
for
anyone
into
dark
beers
this
is
a
great
strong
porter
with
an
amazing
balance
of
many
complex
flavors
aromas
and
structure
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
someone
not
used
to
bigger
beers
but
as
a
porter
fan
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
pretty
sure
hst
would
have
bacardi
anjeo
on
ice
instead
and
dont
really
find
anything
particularly
gonzo
about
it
but
its
a
great
beer
as
your
attorney
i
advise
you
to
pick
up
a
6pack
this
is
where
porter
and
stout
styles
overlap
the
thicker
body
and
roasty
character
make
it
seem
more
stout
but
i
can
see
why
they
call
it
a
porter
it
goes
easy
on
bitterness
in
favor
of
slightly
more
sweetness
but
i
think
it
could
go
either
way
taste
wow
i
didnt
know
quite
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
its
pretty
tasty
coffee
and
chocolate
and
hops
not
sure
why
i
got
no
aroma
from
this
one
but
it
tasted
pretty
damn
good
definitely
one
of
flying
dogs
best
pours
a
heavy
dark
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
collar
aroma
is
off
coffee
with
tones
of
hops
and
alcohol
mellow
enjoyable
taste
of
coffee
and
slightness
of
hops
excellent
texture
chewy
and
heavy
but
smooth
enjoyable
beer
for
a
couple
at
a
time
it
does
sit
heavy
and
is
high
on
octane
level
yum
this
brew
oured
very
dark
with
little
light
brown
head
it
smelled
sweet
and
chocolatey
the
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
are
definitely
apparent
with
he
coffee
flavor
definitely
lingering
on
the
palette
it
is
very
drinkable
despite
its
heaviness
with
the
bitter
of
hops
there
but
is
mostly
masked
by
other
flavors
cheers
this
is
a
definite
keeper
the
first
of
the
mixed
pack
which
means
i
have
high
expectations
for
the
others
a
definite
must
try
d
this
would
be
a
regular
after
dinner
beer
for
me
just
a
real
nice
relaxing
desert
well
this
is
certainly
an
odd
taste
for
a
porter
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
a
nice
looking
tan
head
the
first
sip
i
took
was
very
sweet
and
flavorful
and
absolutely
delicious
the
following
sips
were
not
so
lucky
though
it
seemed
that
the
sweetness
wore
away
and
the
alcohol
was
much
more
present
ive
had
many
a
beer
over
10abv
and
this
one
has
10
times
as
much
alcohol
taste
than
them
at
only
a
hair
over
9
granted
the
little
alcohol
warming
kick
isnt
too
bad
of
a
thing
just
too
much
of
a
mixed
drink
feeling
for
me
would
try
again
more

yowsah
thats
a
big
beer
but
i
finished
it
appearance
is
pretty
good
black
as
coal
but
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
and
taste
are
of
roasted

some

dry

taste
a
bit

comes
through
i
believe
that
it
my
be
nutmeg

feel
is
great
medium

and
only
a
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
rough
but
definately
sessionable
a
bit
expensive
for
what
it
is
storm
king
stout
is
cheaper
not
sure
what
an
imperial
porter
is
but
this
blurs
the

have
to

i
highly
recommend
overall

great
offering
from

i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
their
beer
d
treat
this
one
like
an
imperial

with
a
twist
and
youll
be
perfectly
happy

was

left
a
small
layer
on

color
was
a
very
very
dark
dark
opaque
brown
smell
was
espresso
and
chocolate
but
had
a
small
bit
of
alcohol
poking
through
taste
was
very
slightly
sweet
mostly
robust
burnt
grains
with
a
bitter
chocolate
aftertaste
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
it
coated
very
well
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
but
was
a
tad
bit
acidic
easy
to
drink
did
a
good
job
hiding
the
abv
but
it
did
kick
in
a
bit
faster
than
i
would
expect
d
if
not
for
the
high
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
night
and
morning
i
had
a
hunch
it
would
be
good
but
my
expectations
were
far
exceeded
drinkability
it
would
be
malpractice
to
say
this
is
drinkable
you
will
definitely
enjoy
drinking
it
but
its
the
sort
of
beer
that
you
end
the
evening
with
starting
the
evening
with
it
would
be
suicidal
given
the
abv
from
an
07
bottle
opened
without
fanfare
but
the
head
grew
anyway
poured
black
with
a
mocha
one
finger
head
aroma
is
very
malty
with
smokyburnt
and
woodlike
smell
taste
is
intense
then
goes
right
into
bitter
chocolate
smoked
flavor
aftertaste
is
a
little
bitterdry
overall
a
good
representation
of
a
baltic
porter
ill
edit
this
next
fresh
one
i
have
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
lightbrown
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
a
bit
of
hops
good
longlasting
heavy
sweet
flavor
you
can
definitely
taste
and
smell
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
some
coffee
nice
mediumtofull
body
sticks
on
your
tongue
a
good
while
just
had
this
at
dayton
ale
fest
in
dayton
oh
ive
had
gonzo
many
tunes
both
on
draught
and
bottled
today
was
different
i
was
pleased
to
have
enjoyed
oak
aged
gonzo
absolutely
amazing
the
single
best
beer
ive
ever
consumed
the
oak
brings
forward
a
vanilla
flavor
tha
ive
never
tasted
before
it
also
brings
out
extra
carbonation
like
nothing
beforfe
experienced
aftertaste
very
warming
tastes
of
dark
malt
coffee
and
salt
very
nice
and
complex
beer
drinkability
decently
high
abv
but
its
relatively
well
crafted
not
bad
by
any
stretch
does
a
good
job
of
being
sweet
while
simultaneously
being
very
dark
smoky
and
toasty
malty
drinks
well
for
9
2
the
bitter
aspect
is
refrehing
for
porters
much
sweeter
than
most
ill
drink
some
but
only
so
much
i
had
the
gonzo
a
few
years
ago
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
this
time
around
it
surprised
me
with
the
piney
hop
flavors
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
sweetness
or
chocolate
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
good
stuff
pours
a
thick
syrupy
blackish
body
with
a
tan
head
that
died
quickly
but
left
a
lace
sheath
a
vague
coffee
and
raosted
malt
smell
that
wasnt
much
complemented
a
very
crisp
biting
roasted
malt
and
thick
fullbodied
syrupy
beer
that
is
accented
with
some
roasted
and
coffee
malts
that
lend
a
warming
sensation
on
the
backbite
while
semicreamy
it
also
contains
minor
hop
notes
a
very
goodalmost
great
beer
i
could
have
this
again
but
wouldnt
session
it
because
it
dried
out
my
tastebuds
md
while
i
think
the
beer
tastes
pretty
good
the
mouth
feel
and
the
drink
ability
take
this
one
over
the
top
its
smooth
creamy
without
being
overly
filling
its
thick
enough
to
make
you
want
to
sip
it
and
the
way
it
stays
in
your
mouth
will
have
to
coming
back
for
more
and
more
and
more
this
amazing
brew
gives
most
imperial
stouts
a
run
for
their
money
oh
wow
this
is
tasty
rich
sweet
chocolatey
aroma
slightly
burnt
and
roasted
dark
dark
pour
with
a
sizeable
head
and
great
lacing
overwhelmingly
creamy
mouthfeel
that
slowly
slides
down
the
gullet
flavor
is
very
impressive
thick
and
full
of
roasted
malts
with
powerful
shares
of
chocolate
and
coffee
hands
down
one
of
the
best
porters
out
there
ps
gotta
dig
that
artwork
served
in
a
nonic
poured
a
dark
opaque
brown
just
shy
of
black
with
a
one
inch
tight
coffeecolored
head
with
ringlets
embedded
in
the
cap
webs
of
lacing
adhered
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
volume
decreased
scents
of
dark
fruit
malt
and
coffee
more
dark
fruit
malt
and
coffee
come
out
in
the
flavor
profile
as
well
as
an
earthy
character
a
hint
of
cocoa
a
mild
alcohol
presence
and
a
little
bit
of
char
that
lingers
between
sips
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
light
carbonation
burn
across
the
middle
of
the
tongue
alcohol
was
wellhidden
for
a
9
2
abv
and
not
as
boozy
as
some
other
baltics
ive
tried
very
tasty
with
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
while
still
being
drinkable
drinkability
decently
high
abv
but
its
relatively
well
crafted
not
bad
by
any
stretch
does
a
good
job
of
being
sweet
while
simultaneously
being
very
dark
smoky
and
toasty
malty
worth
trying
d
a
rich
robust
treat
full
of
dark
roasted
flavor
leaving
you
filled
and
satisfied
overall
another
top
notch
us
impy
stout
porter
and
up
with
rogue
and
yeti
as
the
best
ive
tried
note
i
havent
tried
this
fresh
but
can
highly
recommend
aging
it
for
a
couple
of
years
this
porter
drinks
more
like
a
milk
stout
or
other
heavy
sweet
stout
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
with
a
dard
opacity
but
little
head
the
taste
is
very
complex
starting
with
a
coffee
chocolate
on
the
palate
followed
by
a
markedly
sweet
finish
and
a
prolonged
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
quite
pleasant
it
is
thick
in
the
mouth
and
overall
leaves
a
satisfying
afterglow
that
is
accentuated
by
the
effects
of
the
high
alcohol
content
a
nice
dessert
brew
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
the
rest
is
all
good
drunk
quickly
and
would
like
more
but
at
9
abv
i
wont
be
sessioning
these
still
it
is
worth
the
four
just
for
this
one
this
beer
poured
a
pitch
black
and
had
a
wonderfully
thick
tan
head
the
nose
was
roasty
and
there
was
no
lack
of
chocolate
malts
the
tastes
is
also
bursting
with
rich
chocolates
and
a
bit
of
molasses
there
is
also
a
sufficient
usage
of
hop
character
for
this
beer
the
beer
was
very
full
bodied
and
thick
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
its
richness
i
dont
know
if
that
is
a
good
thing
given
its
size
one
could
find
oneself
quite
drunk
after
just
of
few
of
these
things
a
good
brew
for
the
style
recommended
ah
yes
the
great
gonzo
a
pretty
stout
porter
overflowing
with
all
the
tasty
things
a
porter
should
have
id
like
it
a
even
better
with
less
grassy
bitter
funk
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
overall
its
pretty
good
and
full
of
character
just
like
the
late
mr
thompson
i
have
recently
started
trying
to
pair
the
beers
i
have
been
drinking
with
different
types
of
food
and
in
my
very
novice
opinion
i
think
this
one
worked
as
a
dessert
beer
it
was
delicious
paired
with
the
chocolate
mousse
my
girlfriend
made
you
gotta
love
the
ralph
stedman
artwork
on
the
lables
this
is
hugely
drinkable
for
such
a
big
porter
you
could
just
as
easily
sip
this
as
gulp
it
not
as
complex
as
i
had
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
its
still
absolutely
solid
and
delicious
the
beer
is
thick
as
fuck
and
has
a
nice
sized
tan
head
the
beer
doesnt
appear
to
have
much
carbonation
the
beer
smells
hoppy
with
hints
of
malts
the
beer
actually
takes
mostly
of
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
beer
is
very
bitter
but
not
from
the
hops
but
from
the
coffee
flavours
the
chocolate
in
the
beer
is
incredibly
tasty
as
well
the
beer
is
quite
complex
yet
its
not
a
beer
that
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
the
85
ibus
of
this
beer
for
some
reason
some
come
out
much
except
a
bit
in
the
after
taste
however
its
kind
of
like
an
imperial
stout
in
the
bitterness
this
is
just
an
all
around
awesome
porter
d
overall
very
good
but
as
always
less
fusel
would
be
more
desirable
drinkabilty
is
moderate
decent
flavor
are
pretty
easily
consumed
alcohol
restricts
it
some
make
sure
you
save
one
and
try
it
next
year
maybe
i
should
have
sat
on
my
bottles
longer
but
this
tap
was
much
smoother
that
my
previous
bottle
experience
maybe
they
should
have
bottled
this
in
bombers
40
minutes
on
a
goblet
i
never
wanted
it
to
end
notable
for
the
postmortem
portrait
of
hunter
s
thompson
on
the
label
but
its
tasty
as
well
as
eye
catching
the
brew
pours
a
dark
black
and
smells
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
it
tastes
like
mocha
coffee
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
a
clear
note
of
hop
bitterness
its
sweet
almost
reminiscent
of
a
coffee
liqueur
but
its
not
thick
or
syrupy
actually
its
quite
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
darn
good
and
complex
porter
flying
dog
makes
no
claims
so
far
as
i
know
and
i
could
be
wrong
to
actually
brewing
with
coffee
or
oaked
barrels
or
other
such
things
nonetheless
coffee
bitterness
chocolate
sweetness
hints
of
vanilla
all
are
represented
not
too
sweet
by
any
means
i
greatly
appreciate
the
hop
bitterness
though
i
feel
it
may
lean
a
bit
too
much
towards
bitter
towards
the
end
d
outfrigginstanding
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
existence
imo
im
a
huge
fan
of
anything
imperial
or
double
and
this
is
just
about
the
best
widely
available
baltic
porter
out
there
it
still
doesnt
trump
okocim
though
nice
sipping
beer
take
your
time
to
enjoy
d
a
nice
flavorful
drinkable
beer
even
at
9
2
alcohol
scary
how
easy
it
is
to
down
3
or
4
of
these
and
not
realize
it
till
you
dont
remember
your
name
drinkability
i
like
this
one
a
lot
one
of
my
favorite
porters
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
long
but
i
like
heavy
beers
highly
recommended
drinkability
starts
out
hoppy
but
mellows
in
flavors
very
much
worth
the
price
and
i
have
3
more
to
drink
this
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
easy
to
sip
on
and
savour
flying
dog
imperial
porter
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
the
aroma
is
delicious
chocolate
toffee
and
caramel
i
could
be
smelling
some
kind
of
wonderful
desert
the
flavor
is
rich
burnt
chocolate
and
tons
of
caramel
without
the
astringency
i
would
expect
from
the
amount
of
flavor
in
this
beer
damp
herbal
hops
flavor
as
well
as
bitterness
back
up
the
sweet
caramel
in
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
thought
its
a
sipper
for
sure
i
could
drink
the
beer
all
night
overall
a
decent
and
unusual
porter
flavors
lack
a
certain
unity
are
are
still
interesting
alcohol
is
well
concealed
surprising
amount
of
hops
for
a
porter
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
not
everybody
would
like
this
one
it
is
more
for
those
that
are
familar
with
the
flying
dog
types
of
beer
and
those
looking
for
a
unique
beer
drinkability
sure
for
a
porter
it
is
smooth
rich
drinkable
and
a
meal
in
itself
creamy
dark
black
appearance
brown
color
head
that
thins
out
with
thick
lacing
at
the
side
aromas
are
rich
in
mocha
malts
bitter
fruits
wrapped
in
perfect
roast
the
taste
is
thick
creamy
and
milky
bittersweet
mocha
with
an
excellent
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
really
helps
the
drink
remain
consistent
and
excellently
enjoyable
throughout
sipping
overall
fantastic
had
this
on
draft
at
the
blue
anchor
in
delray
beach
fl
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
nice
roasted
quality
with
roasted
barley
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
nose
and
a
sweet
touch
of
molasses
taste
is
very
smooth
with
nice
burn
taste
of
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
overall
a
pretty
impressive
offering
and
a
very
large
beer
go
have
one
of
these
at
the
blue
anchor
you
will
truly
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
beer
and
the
place
d
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
a
good
way
to
start
or
finish
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
take
down
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
ill
be
lucky
to
get
through
this
glass
quite
a
disappointing
beer
especially
for
the
exorbent
price
allinall
a
great
beer
not
sure
what
an
imperial
porter
is
supposed
to
be
but
if
this
is
it
then
i
am
pleased
man
gonzo
was
definitely
a
disappointment
i
might
say
that
a
bit
of
age
could
help
this
beer
but
this
one
has
been
going
for
a
few
months
as
it
is
i
dunno
if
it
would
take
more
on
the
order
of
years
but
i
doubt
ill
wait
that
long
to
find
out
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
some
may
be
turned
off
by
the
alcohol
presence
and
it
was
kind
of
pricey
for
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
inch
an
a
half
dark
tan
head
the
opaque
color
has
brown
edges
in
the
light
carbonation
is
there
the
aroma
is
of
smoked
and
roasted
coffee
beans
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
upfront
and
then
the
roasted
flavor
pokes
through
there
is
a
metallic
aftertaste
along
with
licorice
the
body
is
a
touch
thin
for
style
and
with
the
metal
aftertaste
its
not
one
that
i
would
be
drinking
another
in
that
sitting
d
tasty
but
not
overly
impressive
average
drinkability
for
a
bp
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
ill
probably
only
have
this
again
because
its
so
readily
available
this
beer
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
would
make
for
a
decent
session
12
oz
bottle
into
imp
pint
glass
black
body
with
a
tan
head
chocolate
currant
and
malt
are
very
strong
with
chocolate
being
the
most
prominent
bitter
chocolate
taste
with
some
sweet
in
the
end
not
so
intense
as
ris
and
more
drinkable
a
great
beer
full
bodied
full
flavour
a
well
rounded
beer
and
a
very
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
fairly
unique
almost
like
an
imperial
stout
meets
a
scotch
ale
plus
i
love
the
fear
and
loathing
reference
d
a
nice
smooth
drink
but
the
sweetness
which
is
great
limits
the
amount
i
could
have
in
a
sitting
i
like
it
a
little
warmer
too
a
great
beer
not
the
greatest
but
definitely
way
up
there
within
the
style
a
musttry
overall
a
very
nice
beer
love
the
imperial
porter
designation
i
always
have
i
love
the
hops
in
this
beer
and
this
is
probably
my
favorite
flying
dog
beer
yet
well
done
i
was
just
a
little
overexpectant
on
this
one
i
guess
beer
poured
black
as
night
with
a
beautiful
brown
long
lasting
head
nose
has
hints
of
roasted
malts
abd
chocolate
taste
is
a
huge
blast
of
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
finishes
with
a
blast
of
hops
the
roasted
hop
combo
is
quite
overpowering
leavubg
the
palate
well
coated
with
burnt
hop
residue
mouthfeel
is
perfect
very
chewy
and
think
and
it
glides
extremely
well
across
the
palate
drinkability
is
good
as
the
abv
is
especially
well
hidden
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
is
definitely
over
the
top
definitely
try
this
if
you
are
into
the
imperial
porters
and
stouts
this
beer
pour
very
dark
with
a
light
head
the
smell
was
of
burnt
chocolate
malts
the
flavor
is
nice
and
certainly
not
one
for
a
non
beer
drinker
but
very
nice
to
my
pallette
the
main
flavors
are
of
burnt
chocolate
and
coffee
very
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
9
abv
another
fine
product
i
have
tried
from
flying
dog
brewery
i
use
to
really
love
this
beer
after
revisiting
this
a
couple
of
times
i
am
not
as
impressed
for
some
reason
this
is
still
an
interesting
porter
but
it
seems
a
bit
more
watered
down
and
bland
than
it
use
to
be
pretty
good
for
a
baltic
porter
worth
a
try
looking
forward
to
trying
the
barrel
aged
version
soon
i
found
this
beer
a
little
to
heavy
and
not
as
fresh
or
bitter
come
on
85
ibus
as
i
had
hoped
for
not
a
baltic
porter
but
a
great
american
doubleimperial
porter
drinkability
the
inoffensive
taste
plus
the
cripsness
of
this
brew
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
this
is
an
imperial
porter
that
came
to
party
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
the
head
quickly
dissipates
into
a
think
tan
ring
leaving
no
lacing
behind
the
smell
of
sweet
malty
chocolate
comes
to
the
forefront
on
this
one
a
sweet
chocolaty
taste
moves
to
slight
betterness
as
it
moves
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
and
hot
at
the
same
time
not
too
harsh
but
it
does
come
in
a
little
strong
this
is
a
good
solid
dessert
beer
a
must
try
note
to
self
ranked
17
baltic
porter
when
i
tried
it
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
so
you
could
easily
forget
the
9
2abv
a
couple
will
do
just
fine
definately
drinkable
though
maybe
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
ahold
of
pours
like
used
motor
oil
with
a
fine
head
the
color
of
peanut
butter
lots
of
leafy
hops
in
the
nose
with
underlying
chocolate
malt
very
toasty
malt
up
front
with
a
slightly
thinnerthanexpected
body
hops
are
mostly
on
the
bittering
side
but
some
piney
resin
comes
through
late
along
with
some
astringency
dry
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
flavors
evolve
into
a
burnt
mildly
alcoholic
finish
has
a
slightly
cloying
burntbitter
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
but
its
a
little
rough
and
not
as
complex
as
some
in
this
category
its
missing
some
of
the
more
interesting
earthyleafy
undertones
present
in
better
examples
i
want
to
like
his
beer
because
it
is
so
readily
available
and
has
a
reasonable
price
compared
to
others
like
it
but
i
think
that
is
it
for
me
i
had
this
beer
served
to
me
in
a
goblet
when
the
waiter
brought
it
it
did
not
have
much
of
a
head
on
it
which
i
cannot
blame
on
the
beer
but
it
had
a
thin
layer
of
foam
left
slightly
darker
than
light
brown
which
seamed
to
stick
around
for
the
entire
drink
the
beer
was
a
very
dark
opaque
black
it
looked
awesome
the
aroma
was
nice
a
combination
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
consistent
with
the
smell
but
also
smoky
this
is
one
of
the
better
porters
that
i
have
had
to
date
i
found
it
very
drinkable
smooth
complex
and
a
good
mouthfeel
i
would
send
it
to
the
top
of
my
list
when
orderingbuying
porters
this
would
be
a
fabulous
desert
beer
but
the
strong
flavor
and
high
alcohol
content
would
make
it
difficult
to
enjoy
more
than
a
single
glass
this
is
a
great
porter
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
not
overpowering
pretty
good
drinkability
but
two
would
be
my
limit
a
great
dessert
beer
in
the
mouth
it
was
semichewy
and
the
coffee
lingered
for
while
in
the
mouth
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
brew
that
was
well
balanced
an
well
built
a
little
tough
to
put
down
a
few
of
these
really
the
only
downfall
this
beer
has
d
pretty
good
i
might
stick
to
others
daily
but
its
a
good
standby
if
i
need
it
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
very
little
head
that
receeds
very
quickly
the
nose
is
of
coffee
smokey
toffee
alcohol
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
hoppiness
the
taste
is
complex
and
consistant
with
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
good
for
a
porter
and
thickens
as
it
warms
i
am
glad
i
can
get
these
fairly
easily
as
its
definately
a
beer
i
like
to
enjoy
once
a
week
or
so
fd
hit
the
mark
on
this
one
hope
they
keep
up
the
good
work
eric
drinkability
the
dark
fruits
make
this
one
a
little
bit
of
a
turn
off
for
me
tastes
a
lot
better
than
mikkeller
black
hole
which
has
a
lot
of
the
same
qualities
best
flying
dog
ive
had
yet
but
nothing
i
would
make
a
point
to
get
again
drinkability
a
sipper
but
a
very
solid
and
bold
beer
md
good
carbonation
but
very
thin
mouthfeel
hunter
s
we
still
living
in
the
kingdom
of
fear
raise
our
glasses
to
you
memory
cheers
very
smooth
mouthfeel
near
perfect
overall
this
is
a
nice
imperial
porter
and
a
decent
exemplar
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
flying
dog
makes
they
come
in
little
four
packs
and
upon
the
advice
of
my
attorney
raoul
duke
id
quaff
the
lot
ok
lets
party
the
skeletonhst
says
on
the
label
amen
the
feel
was
a
bit
thicker
and
stickier
than
what
i
would
have
preferred
but
was
wellrounded
enough
to
be
pretty
drinkable
the
9
alcohol
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
taste
has
a
strong
bitterness
presence
from
the
roasted
malts
a
little
stronger
and
thicker
than
i
expected
but
still
good
some
alcohol
comes
out
after
it
warms
up
a
bit
a
very
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
low
carbonation
and
high
bitterness
from
the
malt
makes
it
seem
a
little
stale
for
the
same
reason
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
a
good
beer
to
start
the
night
off
with
but
a
very
intense
beer
that
overloads
you
with
porterness

from
an
07

with
enough
hops
to
balance
at

2
abv
i
really
cant
find
the
alcohol
so
its
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
good
the
dark
malts
linger
overall
its
a
well
crafted
brew
that
drinks
well
could
be
a
real
sleeper
if
you
over
do
it
smells
of
dark
malts
with
dark
chocolate
and
slight
coffee
hints
taste
is
much
more
intense
with
dark
fruit
and
slight
chocolate
notes
much
dryer
than
the
smell
would
lead
one
to
believe
actually
has
sort
of
a
coffee
finish
much
similar
to
having
coffee
at
3
a
m
in
a
diner
while
smoking
lucky
strikes
all
in
all
a
really
great
beer
unique
taste
while
i
have
never
feared
nor
loathed
i
did
enjoy
this
im
sure
hunter
would
be
proud
hv
this
poured
a
very
dark
ruby
with
a
little
bit
of
tan
head
it
smelled
like
dark
fruit
prunes
or
cherries
the
flavor
was
like
dark
cherry
chocolate
with
a
little
hops
and
alcohol
kick
it
was
heavythick
to
drink
with
a
very
smooth
texture
combined
with
a
flavor
that
wasnt
too
strong
making
it
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
tasty
drinkabiliy
seems
normal
for
this
style
at
least
i
wouldnt
expect
to
have
more
than
2
of
these
at
a
time
as
it
is
and
this
take
on
the
style
is
the
same
d
heh
this
one
ranks
up
there
with
me
but
the
beer
is
rather
heavy
and
high
in
alcohol
so
i
can
really
only
have
one
per
session
extremely
black
pour
with
half
a
finger
or
tan
head
that
comes
and
goes
quickly

dark
toast
with
a
slightly
sour

a
trace
of

cola
like
medium

with
an
artificial

type

dark
fruits
appear
towards
the
finish
along
with
a

punch
nice
beer
with
some
odd
flavours
that
pop
up
d
pretty
complex
have
to
be
in
the
mood
could
have
one
or
two
max
m
d
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
at
first
but
thickens
as
it
warms
the
taste
definitely
makes
this
a
slow
sipper
besides
the
high
abv
i
think
this
is
one
im
going
to
age
as
i
am
beginning
to
start
an
aging
collection
overall
a
tasty
chocolatey
porter
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
very
good
tastes
of
blueberries
and
the
hops
are
phenominal
the
word
creamy
comes
to
mind
as
i
drink
it
which
makes
the
drinkability
a
little
higher
but
the
alchohol
is
subtle
so
it
could
sneak
up
you
if
you
feel
like
you
drink
like
youre
trying
to
win
somethin
overall
a
great
porter
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
creamy
at
least
i
do
like
porters
but
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
at
9
2
i
figured
this
one
would
be
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
its
actually
really
fantastic
drinkability
is
very
dangerous
with
these
i
know
trust
me
the
smoothness
in
spite
of
the
high
abv
is
very
deceitful
d
i
cant
see
comfortably
drinking
more
than
one
in
an
evening
tasted
on
22508
this
is
very
enjoyable
to
sip
and
savor
and
to
see
its
evolution
as
it
warms
nicely
done
d
a
great
beer
wellbalanced
hops
and
chocolatecoffee
malt
flavors
i
am
quite
excited
to
try
some
of
these
that
are
stored
in
my
cellar
in
the
future
for
the
strength
very
drinkable
a
more
rounded
body
would
make
it
dangerous
as
it
is
it
is
a
novelty
that
i
shall
enjoy
greatly
on
occasion
not
a
musthavemoreof
i
will
definitely
include
this
beer
on
my
shopping
list
for
as
long
as
it
sticks
around
my
bottle
had
an
abv
of
8
7
and
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
experience
one
i
would
gladly
do
again
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
think
the
abv
hurts
it
a
little
if
they
could
hide
the
alcohol
taste
some
this
beer
would
be
even
better
its
still
worth
trying
though
dmy
definition
of
drinkable
tends
to
be
liberal
but
this
one
is
a
challenge
i
like
this
beer
but
youre
kidding
yourself
if
you
think
its
sessionable
well
unless
you
are
hst
himself
i
suppose
strong
thick
tasty
challenging
you
wont
throw
them
back
rapidamente
though
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
night
it
is
a
very
good
somewhat
complex
brew
velvety
mouthfeel
with
very
slight
carbonation
this
porter
goes
down
very
easy
for
the
higher
abv
quite
drinkable
indeed
a
very
nice
offering
from
flying
dog
but
i
still
cant
help
but
long
for
the
days
of
perkunos
hammer
d
i
actually
was
able
to
have
several
in
a
row
of
this
beer
quite
a
easy
drinker
due
to
the
light
mouthfeel
this
is
some
porter
well
balanced
and
complex
definitely
one
to
find
and
enjoy
this
is
an
adequate
example
of
a
baltic
porter
not
extraordinary
by
any
means
as
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
youll
have
to
try
it
yourself
if
you

the

really
works

i
kinda
just
wanted

i
would
get
this
again

caution
to
myself
as
well
as
others
to
let
it
warm
to
a
proper
temp
drinking
this
cold
will
not
give
you
the
best
impression
of
this
beer
a
nice
change
of
pace
that
lets
the
original
beer
come
through
enough
while
accenting
it
with
notes
of
oak
and
using
a
bit
of
whiskey
for
balance
and
flare
nicely
done
overall
a
very
good
imperial

bottle
from

with
hints

licorice

is
sweet
dark
fruits
up
front
fading
into
a
smooth
bourbon
taste
ends
with
a
blast
of
vanilla
bourbon
very
smooth
and
definite
heat
lingers
it
has
enough
viscosity
for
the
agingwhich
i
find
rare
for
these
ba
portersbut
doesnt
hold
up
quite
like
an
impy
stout
does
in
the
barrel
dry
oak
hangs
around
a
bit
with
the
bourbon
heat
a
nice
beer
overall
a
big
robust
porter
with
a
sweeter
start
and
more
bitter
and
roasted
finish
all
with
a
good
showing
of
whisky
and
woody
flavors
a
nice
slow
sipper
o
good
beer
but
im
not
sure
id
pay
6
for
a
12oz
bottle
again
overalli
picked
this
bottle
up
on
a
whim
and
it
turns
out
it
is
probably
a
couple
years
old
which
is
great
this
is
defiantly
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
the
barrel
aging
improved
the
quality
tremendously
i
would
consider
this
a
lighter
option
for
someone
who
loves
a
big
bold
barrel
aged
ris
i
will
seek
out
the
newer
bigger
bottles
for
sure

paid
38
for
a
12ozish
sized
bottle
at
queens
head
in
stockholm
sweden
smelled
like
madeiraport
very
similar
smell
to
utopias
but
a
little
less
smooth
poured
very
dark
but
it
had
absolutely
no
carbonation
and
no
head
not
a
single
bubble
i
wonder
if
the
bottle
had
maybe
been
previously
opened
and
then
resealed
when
the
purchaser
found
out
it
was
so
expensive
because
the
other
reviewers
claim
there
is
normally
carbonation
i
invited
7
differen
people
to
sample
it
to
make
sure
i
wasnt
crazy
nobody
could
drink
this
it
was
like
a
ruined

with

and
some

body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent

solid
beer
with
quite
dominant
barrelaged
characteristics
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
from
the
many
shades
of
dark
malt
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
the
baltic
porter
style
seems
well
suited
to
the
treatment
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
from
flying
dog
nothing
ground
breaking
however
this
is
quite
solid
o
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
good
beer
though
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
distracting
still
s
solid
beer
overall
tasty
beer
here
from
flying
dog
wild
dog
is
a
pretty
well
done
barrel
aged
brew
the
whiskey
is
definitely
noticeable
gelling
well
with
the
base
beer
of
gonzo
rich
and
full
of
character
the
aftertaste
of
chocolate
malt
makes
a
delicious
reminder
of
how
good
this
beer
is
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
no
date
but
i
think
it
is
the
most
recent
batch
pours
just
like
regular
gonzo
deep
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
head
smells
of
choclate
caramel
and
booze
taste
is
very
malty
lots
of
caramel
and
molasses
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
with
a
very
nice
bourbon
vanilla
aftertaste
mouth
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
light
carbonation

this
up
at
my

sweet
earthy
whiskeydominant

with
hints
of

dark
chocolate
licorice
and

the
barrelaging
really
comes
out
in
the
taste
lots
of
oak
and
whiskey
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
leather
cola
dark
chocolate
and
just
a
touch
of
black
cherries
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
with
medium
carbonation
and
nice
dry
bitter
finish
overall
this
had
decent
body
for
a
porter
and
the
barrel
really
came
through
nicely
glad
i
picked
up
multiple
bottles
of
this
one
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
that
good
because
flying
dog
hasnt
done
it
for
me
lately
but
this
was
an
absolute
delight
highly
recommended
barrelaged
gonzo
no
wild
dog
notation
on
this
new
batch
but
meh
is
very
good
but
it
misses
on
the
greatness
that
other
barrel
aged
stoutsporters
have
reached
d
i
like
that
this
was
actually
a
porter
rather
than
an
imperial
stout
in
disguise
the
malt
character
is
definitely
english
with
the
preponderance
of
brown
malt
flavors
and
in
that
context
the
mild
buttery
note
isnt
totally
out
of
line
unique
stuff
that
id
drink
again
if
offered
probably
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
again
though
o
this
was
20
for
a
750ml
bottle
which
i
say
was
worth
it
once
but
not
again
4
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
standard
gonzo
to
be
sure
but
only
a
small
one
not
the
complex
bourbon
bomb
i
was
expecting
in
short
a
baltic
porter
with
pronounced
darkfruit
and
bourbon
character
330
mlbest
before
reads
in
that
order
17
11
13
into
tulip
o
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
i
like
the
base
beer
very
much
but
this
one
was
too
boozy
for
me
o
it
improves
as
it
warms
gaining
spicy
oakiness
and
other
subtly
enhanced
qualities
i
probably
wouldnt
recommend
it
or
purchase
it
but
id
recommend
a
few
sips
and
id
pick
it
up
if
it
happened
to
be
the
same
price
per
volume
as
standard
gonzo
also
i
know
people
knock
them
for
it
but
i
love
the
presentation
of
these
guys
the
ba
and
regular
version
but
i
am
a
big
hunter
thompson
fan
o
nicely
done
beer
not
too
over
the
top
and
still
has
some
qualities
of
the
base
beer
better
ba
beers
out
there
but
can
not
complain
with
this
at
all
overall
the
base
beer
is
definitly
lost
but
that
being
said
the
whiskey
isnt
overpowering
overall
a
nice
brew
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
and
could
pass
for
a
good
ris
o
definitely
a
good
solid
beer
all
around
and
was
glad
to
see
this
one
on
tap
at
the
infamous
38
degress
anniversary
party
d
very
drinkable
the
barrel
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
but
overall
it
works
really
nicely
with
the
rich
imperial
porter
flavors
in
the
base
beer
again
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
i
just
felt
it
was
a
bit
disappointing
excessively
hot
and
a
little
thin
the
prominent
alcohol
and
heavily
bitter
charred
taste
makes
this
a
little
unappetizing
vintage12aa
overall
great
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
roasty
and
acrid
bourbon
is
fairly
prevalent
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
may
improve
in
a
bottle
with
age
the
beer
is
near
black
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
plasters
the
glass
with
sticky
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasty
with
a
formidable
oak
presence
the
flavor
offers
chocolate
vanilla
oak
roast
booze
my
chief
criticism
is
that
this
beer
is
overly
tannic
and
oaky
with
a
sharp
biting
finish
some
nice
scents
and
flavors
happening
but
a
bit
unrefined
this
beer
has
potential
but
barrel
aged
beers
have
really
gained
in
popularity
and
quality
over
the
last
few
years
and
this
beer
is
lagging
behind
while
this
is
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
recipe
needs
a
few
tweaks
smooth
rich
fullbodied
with
a
light
effervescence
warming
as
you
might
expect
a
truly
amazing
beer
even
better
than
the
original
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
with
qualities
that
definitely
justify
the
price
tag
i
think
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
will
certainly
smooth
out
the
whiskey
notes
but
they
actually
were
not
as
harsh
as
i
was
expecting

this

with
an
interesting
flavor
progression
im
very
sorry
that
flying

no
longer
distributes
to
washington
state
o
exactly
what
you
expect
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
a
baltic
porter
very
enjoyable
but
too
intense
to
be
an
easy
drinker
very
much
a
sipping
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
comes
together
well
enough
to
compete
with
the
best
of
the
style
0
picked
this
up
in
one
of
my
first
big
trades
a
few
months
ago
after
remembering
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
at
churchkey
in
dc
though
if
i
recall
correctly
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
on
cask
gonzo
is
one
of
my
favorite
porters
and
the
barrelaged
version
is
an
improvement
flavorwise
but
the
body
could
use
a
bit
more
structure
the
reveal
flying
dog
wild
dog
barrel
aged
gonzo
imperial
porter
a
solid
beer
and
great
way
to
start
the
bif
nice
barrel
aged
beer
to
have
on
tap
overall
i
didnt
pick
up
on
the
barrel
aging
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
but
it
does
have
the
dark
fruit
flavour
that
ive
come
to
expect
with
baltic
porters
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
went
down
smooth
overall
i
think
this
was
fantastic
beer
the
taste
and
feel
were
spot
on
for
the
style
but
with
the
smell
being
so
big
and
stout
like
i
think
i
was
over
expecting
on
this
one
great
though
and
a
must
try
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
barrel
aged
beer
definitely
one
worth
trying
and
definitely
a
decent
candidate
for
cellaring
if
i
could
get
more
of
this
beer
id
drink
it
quite
a
bit
more
cause
well
its
one
of
those
kinds
of
beers
one
that
im
not
completely
blown
away
by
but
one
that
i
do
quite
enjoy
and
could
easily
find
myself
drinking
on
a
weekly
basis
had
on
tap
at
gingerman
after
a
jam
with
some
buddies
showed
up
in
a
snifter
pretty
dark
in
here
but
this
brew
is
black
as
night
roasted
malts
with
a
whiskey
twist
subtle
booziness
same
thoughts
as
on
the
bottle
the
barrel
just
puts
the
beer
on
steroids
the
barrel
flavoring
adds
thicknes
with
a
boozy
shine
to
the
flavor
but
the
booze
is
way
more
present
in
the
finish
than
anywhere
else
great
beer
excited
to
get
this
on
tap
o
great
beer
i
like
the
original
gonzo
too
but
this
barrel
aged
gonzo
offers
different
unique
notes
the
drinkability
was
very
high
while
remaining
a
very
complex
porter
an
easy
sipper
and
no
hints
of
alcohol
i
think
this
beer
should
have
a
little
more
hype
around
it
because
it
is
awesome
o
pretty
good
beer
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
good
taste
like
the
boozy
flavor
and
smell
but
dont
like
the
mouthfeel
and
overall
a
let
down
for
the
price
a
big
beer
plenty
of
flavour
and
things
going
on
at
times
it
doesnt
work
all
that
well
with
the
taste
and
can
seem
boozy
and
a
little
over
the
top
still
very
interesting
and
an
overall
good
beer
overall
this
is
not
what
i
look
for
nor
was
i
expecting
this
in
a
gonzo
just
total
banana
mush
if
thats
your
thing
then
you
probably
be
in
love
with
it
again
i
have
never
had
such
a
style
barrel
aged
so
i
can
only
compare
to
barrel
aged
stouts
but
this
is
tasty
not
quite
as
heavy
as
a
stout
and
a
little
more
carbonated
but
man
is
it
good
o
a
very
nice
treatment
of
gonzo
im
going
to
keep
one
in
the
cellar
for
another
year
or
two
and
see
how
some
age
treats
this
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
a
great
night
cap
although
whisky
can
be
a
little
overpowering
it
is
fairly
well
balanced
and
is
a
must
try
for
all
beer
enthusiasts
a
very
well
put
together
barrel
aged
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
the
regular
gonzo
but
this
took
it
to
another
level
expect
less
hoppiness
than
regular
gonzo
a
real
treat
thank
for
picking
this
up
for
me
kawilliams81
this
beer
pours
very
dark
with
a
nice
tanish
head
which
has
very
good
retention
but
leaves
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
mildly
fruity
with
some
oak
and
coco
and
vanilla
more
oak
than
bourbon
which
is
light
and
not
intrusive
the
flavor
is
a
bit
light
with
less
of
the
fruityness
and
more
of
the
oak
and
coco
vanilla
is
also
present
with
a
mild
booziness
which
is
welcome
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
thin
with
a
small
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
beer
liked
it
a
lot
but
i
liked
the
regular
gonzo
a
bit
more
plenty
carbonated
was
glad
i
drank
this
last
out
of
the
tasters
provided
at
the
bruery
provisions
not
sure
on
the
age
but
im
guessing
i
could
have
sat
on
this
just
a
bit
longer
there
just
wasnt
anything
else
in
the
fridge
that
seemed
interesting
tonight
a
solid
beer
one
of
the
better
flying
dogs
i
have
had
for
sure
overall
i
dont
know
what
the
heck
i
had
at
churchkey
but
it
sure
could
not
be
this
i
am
loving
it
if
anything
i
would
point
at
the
onedimensionality
of
the
whiskey
and
the
heaviness
of
it
all
as
negatives
but
other
than
that
we
got
a
barrel
winner
here
a
great
sipper
o
this
beer
screams
bourbon
from
the
get
go
i
am
a
whiskey
guy
so
i
love
it
however
if
you
dont
like
whiskey
this
is
not
for
you
the
overall
taste
is
good
the
bourbon
does
fade
a
bit
in
the
middle
which
makes
the
other
flavors
more
apparent
d
great
night
cap
awesome
aged
drink
not
usually
a
fan
of
porters
but
this
is
really
good
o
whiskey
lovers
unite
if
you
are
one
you
will
dig
this
brew
has
a
nice
sweetness
but
finished
with
a
definite
whiskey
flavor
from
the
barrels
very
good
beer
with
a
couple
of
flaws
that
keep
it
from
jumping
into
the
elite
category
no
idea
why
i
held
onto
this
one
for
so
long
but
theres
zippo
alcohol
presence
anymore
like
to
try
it
fresh
maybe
i
will
o
decent
4
o
flying
dog
really
they
did
this
wow
im
thoroughly
impressed
pretty
awesome
stuff
this
beer
is
really
good
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
on
it
that
just
leaves
a
swirled
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
whiskey
fills
the
air
the
boozy
aroma
also
form
on
the
nose
too
and
some
chocolately
malts
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
but
has
a
really
interesting
whiskey
taste
to
it
blended
with
some
roasted
malts
and
some
wood
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
pretty
thick
which
i
like
a
lot
overall
this
beer
is
big
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
probably
buy
more
when
i
see
it
again
this
warm
smooth
alcoholic
and
oily
palate
is
just
relaxing
smooth
and
phenominal
pours
a
very
dark
chocolate
color
with
minimal
tan
head
cola
edging
oily
and
spotty
lacing
clings
thouroughly
the
nose
is
bourbon
infused
with
cherry
cocoa
charred
oak
and
vanilla
there
is
an
overlapping
milk
chocolate
flavor
lingering
as
well
the
taste
is
offering
much
of
the
same
bourbon
flavors
noticed
in
the
nose
but
with
intense
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
charredsmokey
oak
awesome
taste
with
booze
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
pretty
thick
without
compromising
drinkability
overall
this
is
damn
tasty
and
pretty
easily
drinkable
for
such
a
brew
of
this
magnitude
o
decent
barrel
aged
porter
but
not
superb
not
the
best
meld
but
its
nice
to
have
a
decent
barrel
aged
beer
that
i
didnt
have
to
clamor
tooth
and
nail
for
and
grab
multiples
hope
the
heat
dies
down
in
a
year
or
so
and
lets
the
beer
meld
together
o
in
a
perfect
world
every
beer
that
enters
a
barrel
would
result
in
a
more
complex
and
exciting
product
i
have
learned
that
this
is
not
the
case
i
feel
like
this
brew
is
an
example
of
a
great
base
beer
with
a
less
than
stellar
barrel
treatment
still
a
great
brew
im
really
nit
picking
here
but
many
other
barrel
aged
beers
seem
better
balanced
and
overall
more
enjoyable
overall
good
beer
right
now
very
solid
base
flavors
with
great
aging
potential
i
feel
giving
this
a
year
or
two
will
do
wondrous
things
i
will
most
likely
review
this
again
at
some
point
down
the
road
overall
a
solid
porter
slight
alcohol
flavor
is
detected
but
not
too
much
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
o
best
porter
i
have
ever
had
i
enjoy
gonzo
but
this
is
gonzo
times
10
hope
i
can
find
a
few
more
bottles
before
theyre
all
gone
this
beer
pours
an
absolutely
gorgeous
blackness
with
a
darker
tan
foam
that
hangs
around
quite
well
the
aroma
has
much
the
properties
of
whiskey
added
behind
that
are
perhaps
some
dark
fruits
and
dark
chocolate
with
touches
of
vanilla
and
coffee
the
taste
is
truly
dominated
by
the
whiskey
with
a
touch
of
anise
in
the
background
this
puppy
burns
while
going
down
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
quite
flammable
and
that
scares
me
this
should
have
sat
for
so
much
longer
to
make
this
go
away
i
feel
that
there
is
a
tasty
beer
down
beneath
this
but
i
cant
get
over
the
hotness
of
this
its
way
too
fresh
and
i
warn
away
from
those
looking
to
try
it
just
for
the
hell
of
it
this
needs
to
be
cellared
after
that
i
may
revisit
this
but
until
then
it
was
hard
to
swallow
o
i
was
pretty
surprised
at
just
how
drinkable
this
is
the
barrel
aging
definitely
adds
a
lot
of
complexity
to
this
which
helps
it
out
in
the
end
a
good
example
of
a
ba
beer
d
not
bad
but
kind
of
a
disappointment
started
out
solid
but
the
taste
and
feel
quickly
told
me
otherwise
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
maybe
this
needs
time
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
it
was
very
true
to
style
and
the
barrel
aging
wasnt
the
least
bit
overpowering
it
blended
perfectly
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
a
must
try
for
any
porter
fan
o
plain
and
simple
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
not
sure
i
would
call
it
a
porter
at
this
point
but
this
easily
cracks
my
top
10
beers
that
ive
had
in
my
short
craft
venture
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
and
i
would
recommend
anyone
to
seek
it
out
o
overall
this
is
a
great
bourbon
barreled
brew
very
evident
that
bourbon
was
used
and
has
hints
at
similar
tastes
to
bcbs
great
beer
very
sweet
good
in
small
pours
but
this
is
one
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
although
i
think
some
age
could
improve
the
barrel
integration
really
enjoyed
how
whiskey
forward
this
was
m
somwhat
watery
and
light
for
what
i
expexted
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
grab
a
bottle
if
you
see
it
ill
regret
leaving
that
one
behind
for
a
while
and
never
miss
the
chance
for
a
fresh
pour
definately
a
worthwhile
effect
from
the
folks
at
flying
dog
it
took
a
while
to
taste
this
version
of
the
classic
gonzo
but
im
glad
that
i
did
drink
it
was
okay
better
than
average
but
not
by
much
i
thought
it
was
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
for
the
style
i
just
havent
really
been
impressed
with
flying
dog
too
much
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
o
good
beer
not
widely
available
in
my
area
but
if
was
i
would
throw
a
couple
in
the
cellar
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
barrel
presence
lots
of
whiskey
flavor
up
front
that
kind
of
dominates
subtle
earthy
oak
and
vanilla
but
lots
of
heat
and
booze
underneath
some
nice
smokiness
and
silky
chocolate
sweet
with
toffee
toast
and
licorice
but
whiskey
heatsweetness
dominates
lots
of
alcohol
flavor
without
being
overly
hot
subtle
warmth
in
the
chest
a
really
delicious
and
interesting
sipper
an
interesting
beer
nothing
something
i
could
drink
huge
quantities
of
but
a
really
good
bourbon
barrel
aged
porter
oa
big
improvement
on
the
base
beer
very
nice
i
have
one
left
will
try
it
again
in
a
year
tastes
really
good
lots
going
on
here
alcoholbooze
flavors
are
more
pronounced
and
the
woodiness
really
compliments
the
chocolate
well
light
fruitiness
comes
out
that
is
not
quite
as
prevalent
in
the
regular
gonzo
i
find
this
to
be
just
about
as
enjoyable
as
the
nonba
version
but
different
more
complex
all
the
flavors
do
not
integrate
perfectly
but
that
is
a
minor
complaint
maybe
it
will
come
together
with
some
age
very
good
brew
right
now
though
i
bought
4
bottles
at
about
4
bucks
apiece
and
am
very
happy
with
the
purchase
an
awesome
beer
i
like
the
smoke
thrown
in
with
the
barrel
aging
makes
it
a
bit
unique
as
far
as
barrel
aged
beers
go
a
must
try
while
the
taste
has
some
rough
edges
to
it
and
that
imperial
porter
body
didnt
quite
hold
up
to
the
barrelaging
here
this
still
had
a
delicious
nose
on
it
and
handled
its
high
abv
quite
well
for
itself
helping
to
leave
an
overall
favorable
impression
of
this
on
me
considering
that
this
is
normally
easier
to
get
then
a
lot
of
ba
beers
out
there
i
would
definitely
keep
this
one
around
when
youre
looking
for
that
kind
of
fix
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
tastey
every
sip
leaves
me
wanting
another
i
definately
reccommend
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
absolutely
zero
head
and
zero
lacing
smells
of
roasted
coffee
toasted
coconut
vanilla
wood
and
some
bourbon
notes
taste
is
exactly
like
the
nose
but
the
coffee
taste
is
subdued
and
there
are
some
soy
sauce
flavors
slight
alcohol
taste
and
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
each
sip
ok
this
beer
has
zero
carbonation
it
is
super
flat
super
thick
and
a
chore
to
even
take
a
swallow
horrible
horrible
feel
overall
this
beer
is
obviously
off
in
the
carbonation
department
i
am
not
sure
what
happened
here
since
the
other
reviews
i
am
reading
dont
have
this
issue
i
bet
this
would
be
pretty
awesome
if
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
issues
were
normal
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
despite
the
decline
in
taste
from
the
nose
its
still
pretty
good
but
not
enough
for
being
barrelaged
in
my
opinion
this
ended
up
being
a
lot
more
oaky
than
i
wouldve
expected
which
while
not
necessarily
bad
is
not
desired
when
its
overshadowing
the
whiskey
worth
a
try
if
its
available
but
im
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
although
this
is
no
longer
a
colorado
brewery
and
not
getting
much
of
my
money
these
days
i
couldnt
pass
on
this
on
tonight
on
tap
poured
a
rich
black
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
aromas
of
whiskey
chocolate
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
colorado
whiskey
vanilla
oak
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
o
much
much
better
than
the
regular
version
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beer
the
finish
was
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
thats
just
nitpicking
taste
is
exceptionally
roasty
a
bit
of
oakiness
leading
to
a
slight
whiskey
taste
malt
is
the
overriding
flavor
heavy
viscous
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
unique
porter
overall
great
ageable
brew
would
be
great
with
some
dust
on
the
bottle
share
this
with
friends
750ml
bottle
from
ajs
pours
black
with
a
think
tan
head
aroma
has
lots
of
wood
whiskey
and
vanilla
taste
is
sweet
with
some
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
finish
is
dry
in
large
part
because
of
the
wood
its
a
nice
beer
that
develops
as
it
warms
nice
effort
and
the
whiskey
adds
a
totally
different
character
than
bourbon
nice
change
of
pace
o
overall
i
think
this
is
really
a
pretty
good
beer
like
i
said
above
regular
gonzo
i
think
is
really
underappreciated
the
whiskey
flavor
imparted
on
this
beer
adds
another
level
of
complexity
and
flavor
to
an
already
good
brew
to
be
perfectly
honest
this
beer
reminds
me
of
bcbs
which
is
saying
something
overall
i
love
what
flying
dog
has
created
enjoyed
it
till
the
last
drop
still
a
decent
beer
but
miles
below
what
it
could
and
should
be
i
hold
breweries
accountable
for
the
bottled
quality
of
their
product
however
so
flying
dog
does
not
get
a
pass
on
this
i
look
forward
to
having
another
one
of
these
from
a
different
batch
with
high
hopes
wow
what
a
great
beer
poured
opaque
black
with
a
thin
brownish
head
cocoa
and
semisweet
chocolate
in
the
nose
with
molasses
and
roasted
malts
similar
taste
very
roasty
malty
toasted
wood
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
bean
with
a
strong
but
bearable
alcohol
tastebite
very
littlealmost
noneof
the
obvious
hop
profile
noted
in
the
regular
nonbarrelaged
gonzo
porter
thick
and
heavy
mouthfeel
leaving
some
film
behind
very
complex
and
flavorful
highly
drinkable
notes
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
it
is
not
a
barrel
aged
brew
i
would
actively
seek
out
it
feels
strangely
young
around
the
wood
and
makes
me
miss
some
of
the
qualities
the
assertive
boozy
edge
and
some
heftiness
in
the
body
of
the
regular
gonzo
not
a
bad
drop
and
interesting
to
try
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
original
gonzo
overall
pretty
good
great
nose
good
flavors
good
roast
and
chocolate
i
wish
the
whisky
and
oak
made
a
little
more
presence
the
body
is
a
little
lighter
than
expected
and
its
waaay
to
hot
even
with
a
little
age
that
this
has
ill
keep
the
750
in
teh
cellar
for
longer
to
see
if
it
mellows
overall
i
liked
this
one
but
didnt
love
it
a
very
good
beer
worth
the
price
of
admission
o
overall
a
very
nice
barrel
aged
porter
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurt
it
a
bit
would
give
another
shot
decided
to
give
this
another
chance
so
i
bought
a
12
oz
bottle
i
mentioned
in
my
previous
review
that
this
had
the
making
of
a
good
beer
flavors
and
aroma
were
pretty
much
still
the
same
but
the
carbonation
really
does
wonders
i
have
adjusted
my
rating
accordingly
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
that
has
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
huge
vanilla
and
bourbon
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
sweet
with
vanilla
and
bourbon
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
light
coffee
more
vanilla
on
the
finish
medium
body
medium
carbonation
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
a
very
one
dimensional
beer
i
got
pretty
much
all
barrel
from
it
and
not
much
else
i
prefer
the
regular
gonzo
to
this
jet
black
pour
with
a
nice
looking
mocha
bubbly
head
that
quickly
dissapates
the
aroma
has
some
butterscotch
up
front
slight
sugary
candy
and
some
burnt
malt
not
getting
a
lot
of
barrel
aging
on
this
the
taste
has
a
hoppy
bite
on
the
initial
sip
with
some
caramel
on
the
palate
bitter
finish
still
not
getting
much
of
any
barrel
on
this
drink
not
very
impressed
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
almost
no
carbonation
which
is
good
overall
i
was
disappointed
in
this
effort
as
i
love
the
original
worthy
of
a
shot
but
for
my
taste
ill
go
without
the
barrel
aging
o
not
bad
but
id
like
to
see
this
aged
for
a
bit
longer
in
the
barrel
its
missing
a
more
pronounced
barrel
flavor
that
it
could
get
from
an
extended
stay
there
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
pleased
to
find
a
12oz
bottle
of
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
that
appears
brown
when
held
up
to
light
very
small
brown
head
on
this
beer
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
outstanding
lovely
oak
and
vanilla
aromas
are
dominant
with
some
nice
whiskey
scents
as
well
sweet
malt
with
a
dab
of
chocolate
this
beer
smells
so
yummy
taste
is
also
very
yummy
initially
i
get
some
delicious
vanilla
and
oak
with
a
hint
of
cherry
and
some
dark
fruits
then
i
get
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
tasty
whiskey
flavors
thrive
throughout
each
sip
delicious
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
with
good
carbonation
but
not
too
much
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
is
highly
mouthwatering
and
not
too
high
in
abv
for
a
barrel
aged
imperial
brew
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
doesnt
need
to
be
aged
imo
drinking
very
well
right
now
d
same
statement
as
mouthfeel
d
a
sipper
to
be
savoured
enjoyed
this
beer
with
my
stepdad
in
durham
nc
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
but
the
blend
of
flavors
were
a
bit
off
for
me
maybe
baltic
porters
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
still
savored
it
slowly
though
and
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
d
a
slow
drinker
for
sure
as
it
took
both
my
wife
about
45
minutes
each
to
finish
our
snifters
of
this
stuff
it
was
a
fantastic
beer
nontheless
the
body
is
mediumtomedium
heavy
not
too
viscous
but
not
water
either
not
enough
abv
or
alcohol
burn
to
slow
consumption
appreciably
i
have
not
really
been
a
fan
of
flying
dog
in
the
past
but
after
trying
this
beer
im
going
to
keep
a
more
open
mind
excellent
stuff
d
started
off
strong
but
it
couldnt
finish
but
still
its
one
of
the
cheapest
ba
beers
out
there
so
it
could
be
a
good
entry
point
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
nice
on
the
palate
lead
off
is
sweetness
followed
by
some
booze
the
beer
isnt
hot
and
the
finish
is
heavy
enough
as
to
not
be
dry
the
back
is
not
very
bitter
less
so
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
at
least
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
and
had
just
never
gotten
around
to
it
thanks
lunch
id
have
it
again
d
a
bourbon
bomb
to
say
the
least
i
would
argue
that
this
is
on
the
level
of
gi
bcbs
but
it
is
far
less
alcoholic
and
i
have
yet
to
find
the
original
gonzo
to
compare
against
i
would
really
like
to
try
it
though
since
most
of
the
original
beers
flavor
are
clearly
masked
by
the
barrel
which
is
ok
if
the
beers
name
has
bourbon
in
it
but
otherwise
eh
fd
i
dont
think
this
beer
can
outright
excuse
all
of
the
bad
beer
you
make
but
it
has
at
least
encouraged
me
to
continue
to
try
some
of
your
more
limited
releases
d
a
delicious
robust
beer
that
will
caress
your
taste
buds
all
night
long
a
real
pleasure
to
sample
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
and
is
coming
along
quite
nicely
the
body
has
lightened
up
some
but
the
nose
and
flavors
are
doing
very
very
well
this
was
a
top
notch
brew
when
fresh
and
its
still
a
top
notch
brew
now
scores
are
the
same
except
a
little
knock
on
the
lighter
palate
still
glad
i
was
able
to
hold
onto
a
bottle
of
this
for
so
long
definitely
check
this
one
out
and
age
a
couple
if
you
can
will
be
getting
more
within
a
week
d
this
was
a
very
smooth
and
tasty
beer
with
a
nice
and
rich
scent
and
flavor
good
body
too
so
not
difficult
to
drink
even
though
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
noticeable
only
a
little
age
on
this
bottle
but
it
has
probably
helped
already
and
it
probably
hasnt
peaked
yet
one
of
the
better
oak
flavors
in
a
dark
beer
a
single
malt
whiskey
of
a
beer
seriously
nice
56
dollars
for
a
single
12oz
a
bargain
if
you
consider
this
a
poor
mans
older
viscosity
on
the
other
hand
i
would
btch
and
moan
about
paying
22
for
a
4
pack
this
is
definitely
a
nicely
drinkable
barrelaged
beer
even
at
9
50abv
it
hides
its
alcohol
nicely
overall
this
is
pretty
good
specialty
brew
from
my
local
fredneck
homeboys
a
little
pricey
but
nice
job
nonetheless
drinkability
at
almost
10
a
pint
isnt
a
problem
but
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
that
for
this
style
its
drinkable
because
it
has
a
good
balance
and
smoothness
well
done
soothing
chocolate
and
whisky
flavor
it
massages
the
palate
never
offensive
this
is
like
ba
yetis
little
brother
corn
and
straw
tang
from
the
whisky
hits
around
the
sides
of
the
tongue
dark
burnt
fruits
raisins
plums
round
out
the
flavor
silky
mouthfeel
it
seems
thick
and
thin
at
the
same
time
12oz
bottle
great
black
pour
with
with
kind
of
creamy
beige
head
i
normally
look
for
in
my
impy
stouts
looks
very
good
nice
aroma
full
of
dark
chocolate
and
malts
but
not
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
i
would
expect
taste
follows
suite
this
is
a
fine
porter
but
i
wish
i
had
a
bottle
of
the
regular
gonzo
to
taste
next
to
this
i
think
this
may
be
a
bit
sweeter
which
i
am
fine
with
but
if
i
did
not
know
this
was
a
barrel
aged
beer
i
would
not
have
guessed
it
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
some
damn
tasty
stuff
i
was
a
bit
reluctant
at
first
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
original
gonzo
porter
but
im
glad
i
picked
one
of
these
up
now
even
at
512oz
bottle
great
beer
not
as
thick
as
i
would
have
predicted
but
still
very
good
aroma
could
use
more
bourbon
in
my
opinion
but
all
around
pretty
easy
sipping
and
smooth
drinkability
overall
it
was
okay
i
fear
my
bottle
was
slightly
corked
as
there
were
some
noticeable
off
flavors
the
smell
is
truly
exceptional
so
much
so
that
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
in
case
my
bottle
was
a
dud
d
for
a
9
5
alcohol
beer
the
drinkability
is
tremendous
if
you
enjoy
whiskey
and
enjoy
beer
this
beer
is
perfect
for
you
bottom
line
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
but
a
little
pricey
at
7
for
a
bottle
a
good
beer
but
its
nothing
special
and
there
are
better
beers
out
there
d
this
is
a
completely
flat
beer
great
taste
and
smell
just
flat
no
head
to
speak
of
and
the
aroma
was
most
likely
muted
without
any
bubbles
interesting
overall
this
is
an
awesome
example
of
a
barrel
aged
porter
a
definite
must
try
and
i
would
seek
it
out
again
full
bodied
and
sticky
this
is
a
slow
sipper
but
still
very
tasty
the
barrel
aging
prevails
once
again
on
this
one
bottle
nice
cork
and
cage
bottle
with
artwork
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
coastered
tan
head
dark
roast
dark
chocolate
and
whiskey
barrel
notes
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
really
smooth
and
balanced
sweet
start
of
dark
chocolate
transitions
to
whiskey
oak
notes
then
really
smooth
with
only
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
surprisingly
easy
drinking
very
solid
baltic
porter
drinkability
is
fairly
meh
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
again
fairly
onenote
and
that
note
is
really
driven
into
the
ground
the
lack
of
supporting
sweetness
or
richness
from
the
base
beer
doesnt
help
either
overall
i
love
this
beer
then
again
i
love
mosts
beers
that
are
barrel
aged
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
very
modest
to
high
level
of
carbonation
the
level
of
carbonation
inside
this
brew
could
really
be
turned
down
a
few
notches
to
make
it
perfect
this
brew
really
has
a
lot
to
offer
it
is
deep
and
complex
with
a
lot
of
flavor
to
take
in
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
brew
develops
as
this
is
not
the
first
time
flying
dog
released
this
brew
being
a
fresh
2010
release
i
fully
anticipate
my
enjoyment
level
growing
as
i
hold
on
to
a
few
bottles
of
this
to
sample
in
the
future
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
good
mocha
head
and
a
bit
of
sticky
lace
the
nose
brings
some
nice
bourbon
oak
coffee
vanilla
and
light
chocolate
flavor
is
a
bit
more
tame
with
some
roast
and
bourbon
its
not
as
integrated
as
the
nose
good
heavy

with

for

burnt
element
to
them
intertwined
with
some
vanillablack
licorice
and
woodthe
wood
really
lingers
in
the
finish
smooth
and
full
this
beer
is
rich
and
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
its
really
a
niced
oaked
baltic
porter
d
this
is
one
id
have
again
its
a
little
hot
but
its
pretty
good
not
quite
world
class
but
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
tried
it
fresh
and
it
was
good
but
the
age
has
made
it
simply
amazing
i
put
this
in
the
top
five
beer
i
have
had
on
tap
into
a
4oz
tasting
tulip
black
pour
with
nice
lacing
and
retention
a
super
sweet
aomr
of
all
whiskey
and
vanilla
sweet
but
i
do
like
it
the
taste
is
all
really
sweet
but
its
not
so
sweet
i
cant
drink
it
in
fact
it
makes
it
easy
to
drink
wish
it
was
a
tad
more
complex
but
if
you
want
a
really
sweet
beer
with
high
alcohol
give
this
a
shot
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
loved
how
the
whiskey
was
restrained
unlike
other
ba
beers
unfortunately
some
of
the
other
flavors
i
found
muted
i
also
thought
carbonation
was
a
tad
high
oh
and
i
dont
see
how
this
is
a
baltic
porter
if
it
is
just
gonzo
barrelaged
anyway
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
is
not
very
good
it
feels
like
drinking
a
mass
amount
of
whiskey
i
know
it
is
almost
cliche
to
give
a
good
review
to
a
barrel
aged
stout
anymore
but
this
is
very
good
lots
of
nuance
and
layers
everything
is
very
well
incorporated
and
something
i
would
recommend
personally
the
fact
that
the
whiskey
is
subtle
is
nice
but
wild
dog
seems
to
be
a
bit
overcarbonatedwhich
tends
to
lift
and
displace
many
of
the
beers
po
tential
nuances
off
the
palate
overall
though
this
is
a
tasty
treat
from
the
wood
meant
for
a
snifter
at
room
temperature
which
is
when
this
beer
really
opens
up
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
in
the
aroma
bourbon
oak
hints
of
alcohol
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
rich
chocolate
malt
and
ends
with
a
bourbon
taste
a
smooth
and
medium
to
big
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
chocolate
and
hint
of
bourbon
in
the
aftertaste
huge
nose
of
bourbon
rich
chocolate
with
a
small
to
no
aftertaste
flavor
is
wonderful
big
whiskey
notes
up
front
but
not
overkill
and
boozy
just
a
nice
amount
to
smooth
over
the
whole
mouthfeel
lots
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
slight
bittersweet
chocolate
a
little
oak
comes
through
malts
and
some
sugars
not
overly
sweet
either
like
some
barrel
aged
portersstouts
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
medium
carbonation
slightly
boozy
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
its
a
very
strong
beer
with
some
layers
to
it
i
think
its
very
recommendable
for
the
cold
month
ahead
of
us
thanks
to
jdiddy

this
is

the

makes
it
really
quite

much

it
is
interesting
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
head
that
builds
rapidly
way
more
than
the
normal
gonzo
porter
and
it
stays
till
it
is
gone
theres
heavy
alcohol
aroma
on
the
beer
along
with
semibitter
dark
chocolate
and
some
caramel
mixed
in
definitely
a
different
taste
than
the
original
gonzo
the
barrel
aging
really
comes
through
with
a
smoky
aftertaste
in
this
beer
to
go
along
with
the
dominating
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
while
the
alcohol
stuck
out
a
little
bit
in
the
smell
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
9
5
percent
good
stuff
limited
availability
i
recommend
grabbing
a
bottle
or
two
if
you
see
it
apparently
they
can
age
this
beer
in
any
container
and
for
any
amount
of
time
and
it
is
still
a
quick
swift
kick
in
the
pants
although
the
barrels
sanded
off
the
most
aggressive
burrs
the
beer
continues
its
harshness
and
roughness
still
very
rich
thick
and
boldly
flavored
of
espresso
cocoa
powder
and
booze
aromas
pick
up
on
very
raw
and
earthy
pungent
citrus
hops
which
flow
right
into
the
flavors
and
bittering
feels
every
bit
as
thick
as
discribed
along
with
a
charred
coal
ashey
flavor
and
feel
that
i
could
live
without
the
barrels
seem
to
give
a
marshmellow
texture
and
a
bit
of
mellowing
the
beer
will
certainly
improve
with
time
but
until
it
matures
ill
not
be
the
biggest
of
fan
poured
a
deep
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
huge
overflowing
brown
head
absolutly
no
fade
on
this
one
fantastic
retention
with
significant
lace
throughtout
the
glass
smell
was
very
rich
full
of
chocolate
and
sugar
with
hints
of
caramle
and
a
slight
hoppiness
the
taste
was
great
full
creamy
and
exceptionally
smooth
lots
of
roasted
malts
chocoalte
and
caramel
hints
throughtout
a
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
but
hardly
noticeable
and
very
tolerable
nice
hints
of
oak
as
it
warmed
nothing
overpowering
like
some
other
beers
i
have
had
that
have
been
oak
aged
overall
this
was
remarkably
good
and
dare
i
say
an
improvement
over
the
regular
gonzo
which
in
and
of
itself
is
a
great
brew
very
nice
and
definatly
a
winner
d
its
thick
and
heavy
but
tasty
and
good
i
recommend
at
least
trying
it
while
its
here
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
respectable
frothy
head
smell
is
of
a
roasty
bourbon
the
taste
is
huge
a
very
good
underlying
porter
with
a
large
amount
of
bourbon
flavoring
the
mouthfeel
is
big
and
creamy
however
there
was
way
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
the
same
comment
was
made
by
all
and
that
was
this
is
good
but
doesnt
compare
to
founders
kbs
still
a
very
good
beer
but
not
as
complex
or
as
good
as
several
others
yep
this
is
definitely
way
over
carbonated
it
foams
up
quite
a
bit
as
it
first
hits
my
tongue
even
after
5
minutes
the
head
has
not
subsided
in
the
least
a
quick
swirl
to
shake
loose
some
carbonation
lets
the
foam
climb
an
additional
three
fingers
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
and
still
not
overflow
down
the
out
sides
without
the
excessive
carbonation
the
beer
begins
to
take
on
a
creamy
mouth
feel
even
in
the
flavor
the
barrel
still
plays
the
dominant
role
notes
of
vanillin
oakbutter
whiskey
soaked
oak
and
a
touch
of
spicy
woodiness
are
all
easily
noticeable
the
gonzo
underneath
the
wood
is
not
all
that
noticeable
somehow
though
the
underlying
gonzo
plays
an
interesting
supporting
role
by
that
i
mean
that
the
oak
here
is
not
too
overwhelming
despite
being
the
most
noticeable
flavor
the
imperial
porter
flavors
while
not
particularly
stand
out
hold
the
oak
in
check
enough
to
make
this
reasonable
drinkable
still
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
a
lot
more
if
a
quarter
of
this
was
mixed
with
three
quarters
of
the
regular
gonzo
highly
recommended
notes
in
a
nutshell
its
huge
offering
that
will
take
your
palate
and
slap
it
around
for
an
hour
it
would
get
an
easy
4
5
overall
after
a
few
months
but
for
now
its
a
bit
raw
even
with
the
aging
this
could
be
a
brew
that
achieves
a
wide
range
of
scores
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
this
brewery
although
the
double
pale
ale
has
been
calling
me
from
my
makeshift
cellar
for
a
couple
days
now
great
beer
aroma
was
pleasant
flavor
and
taste
enhanced
by
leaving
it
out
for
a
while
a
solid
offering
o
thomas
hookers
imperial
porter
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
bit
too
much
intense
sweetness
in
the
early
and
midpalate
and
overly
pronounced
sourness
in
the
finish
it
is
complex
however
and
worth
a
try
as
it
may
hit
some
peoples
palate
right

o
this
is
a
really
nice
porter
it
is
not
very
complex
but
it
is
very
truetostyle
and
very
tasty
i
love
the
thicker
mouthfeel
that
almost
borders
on
stout
territory
and
it
is
insanely
drinkable
for
8
abv
if
i
hadnt
known
i
wouldve
guessed
it
was
around
56
im
really
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
im
glad
i
have
another
offering
from
thomas
hooker
liberator
in
my
fridge
ill
have
to
check
out
more
from
them
when
im
back
up
in
new
england
thanks
jared
i
recommend
picking
this
one
up
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
example
for
a
porter
overall
a
nice
step
up
from
the
lager
dopplebock
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
solid
porter
minus
the
lack
of
head
and
carbonation
this
beer
is
still
good

very
good
imperial
porter
it
does
have
a
few
drawbacks
namely
the
fact
that
it
is
basically
a
dubbel
porter
and
the
taste
certainly
reflects
this
a
porter
on
steroids
also
the
alcohol
content
tends
to
sneak
up
on
you
and
kick
you
in
the
shorts
still
the
brew
certainly
exceeded
my
expectations
and
i
would
unreservedly
recommend
this
beer
poured
from
undated
bottle
to
mug
the
beer
arrives
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
deep
brown
edges
in
the
light
a
nice
2
finger
offwhitelight
mocha
color
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
bled
of
roasted
barley
and
caramel
sweetness
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
perhaps
a
heat
from
the
alcohol
the
beer
starts
very
much
the
same
way
with
a
smooth
creamy
malt
roast
after
which
the
dark
fruit
and
caramel
warm
the
beer
up
a
bit
finishes
with
a
lingering
roast
mild
bitterness
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
medium
bodied
and
creamy
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
a
treat
very
enjoyable
o
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
but
overall
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
with
all
of
the
fruity
taste
it
becomes
a
bit
more
drinkable
as
the
beer
warms
up
o
the
alcohol
presence
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
cola
aroma
and
vinous
notes
the
beer
is
not
overly
enjoyable
to
me
with
a
little
too
much
balsamic
vinegar
overall
really
impressive
for
a
9
year
old
imperial
porter
very
enjoyable
found
at
backstage
in
torrington
ct
this
ones
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
decent
light
chocolate
colored
head
and
good
lacing
the
nose
picks
up
a
smokey
chocolate
firm
and
enticing
the
flavor
nicely
mirrors
the
aroma
with
more
of
the
charcoal
theme
no
interesting
nuances
really
just
solid
standard
stuff
this
is
a
mediumplus
bodied
porter
with
a
slightly
resinous
velvetty
feel
very
pleasant
stuff
with
solid
though
pretty
typical
porter
flavor
wish
it
was
something
a
little
more
unique
but
most
improtantly
its
a
very
good
porter
it
never
quite
struck
me
as
an
imperial
version
with
little
suggestion
of
alcohol
or
magnified
flavors
but
no
complaints
here
the
taste
is
like
the
first
wet
kiss
on
the
end
of
a
hot
fist
i
lie
its
a
pleasant
homeostasis
of
warming
wet
hops
love
and
alcoholically
dry
sweet
malts
i
need
a
new
thesaurus
for
the
word
subtle
whereas
the
world
flops
in
clown
shoes
towards
imperial
porters
theres
a
real
growing
appreciation
from
this
roller
skate
for
the
complex
and
delicious
porter
bravo

does
this

jump

looks

my
introduction

id
love
to
try
the
oak
aged
version
overall
impression
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
imperial
porter
but
it
just
didnt
quite
hit
for
me
there
was
something
a
little
lacking
maybe
a
little
thin
about
it
in
both
flavor
and
body
that
kept
the
score
from
being
higher
overall
a
strong
imperial
porter
with
an
aroma
that
is
better
than
the
flavor
overall
im
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
the
aroma
is
great
the
taste
is
just
odd
and
makes
me
go
back
and
forth
in
the
end
while
its
not
exactly
what
im
looking
forward
to
in
a
porter
its
still
a
nice
flavor
unremarkable
pretty
good
but
nothing
to
set
it
apart
from
hundreds
of
other
porters
little
too
bitter
on
the
finish
very
roasty
and
chocolatey
something
is
missing
in
the
balance
overall
its
been
a
long
time
hooker
i
recall
seeing
them
far
more
often
at
the
marketplace
around
2006
then
i
recall
a
few
infected
largesized
swingtop
bottles
got
one
myself
and
after
that
they
seemed
to
all
but
vanish
from
the
stores
in
ga
now
im
seeing
them
a
bit
more
now
with
their
entire
lineup
in
twelve
ounce
capped
bottles
it
seems
id
revisited
their
doppelbock
late
last
year
enjoyed
it
and
now
its
time
to
revisit
the
imperial
porter
its
good
thankfully
not
infected
but
seems
more
bitter
than
i
recall
even
with
the
strong
amount
of
alcohol
in
this
i
could
hardly
feel
it
as
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
hard
to
dislike
this
offering
since
its
so
silky
and
easygoing
and
any
fan
of
dark
or
dessert
beers
will
find
it
well
worth
it
to
seek
this
beer
out
its
a
great
example
of
how
enjoyable
a
porter
can
be
od
at
7
8
abv
it
doesnt
scream
boozy
but
has
a
bunch
of
great
flavors
jumping
around
its
a
straight
forward
beer
but
its
good
at
what
it
does
a
solid
hooker
brew
o
ehhh
i
do
like
hooker
but
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
perhaps
its
better
fresh
but
the
driving
bitter
roastiness
was
a
bit
tiring
i
guess
its
in
between
a
porter
and
a
stout
the
flavors
seem
to
be
a
bit
intense
and
big
while
the
body
is
thinner
o
not
my
favorite
porter
but
definitely
one
of
the
more
memorable
ones
good
stuff
drinkability
an
excellent
porter
next
time
i
see
this
ill
grab
several
excellent
beer
tasting
choice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
if
you
like
porters
and
have
a
sweet
tooth
then
this
beer
will
be
right
up
your
alley
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
southern
tier
offering
lots
of
sweet
chocolate
probably
too
much
sweetness
for
me
overall
its
a
good
beer
one
i
would
pick
up
in
a
pinch
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
soft
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
very
flavorful
the
dark
roast
is
definitely
improved
as
the
beer
warms
in
your
mouth
surprisingly
very
drinkable
for
an
imperial
beer
goes
down
quick
and
easy
and
on
the
sweetcocoa
side
of
things
well
done
t
hooker
on
a
side
note
i
found
this
brew
had
some
traits
that
i
found
familiar
i
cracked
into
the
cellar
and
on
a
lark
opened
a
jubel
2010
i
found
a
similar
yet
more
subdued
weaker
less
imperial
flavor
in
the
jubel
just
fyi
aroma
is
smoky
and
oily
with
undertones
of
quality
coffee
and
molasses
and
a
hint
of
hops
it
pours
a
barely
transparent
cola
brown
with
a
thick
finebubbled
tan
head
smoky
flavor
has
tones
of
molasses
and
coffee
and
a
hoppy
bitter
undertone
texture
is
thick
smooth
and
fizzy
leaving
a
fairly
persistent
smoky
and
slightly
hoppy
tingle
this
is
a
good
porter
but
i
dont
know
3
5
d
again
a
good
beer
but
the
weird
flavor
meshing
reduces
my
desire
for
another
one
d
i
had
previously
only
had
the
oakaged
version
of
this
brew
way
better
but
i
was
unaware
that
it
was
actually
a
different
brew
than
this
as
it
does
not
indicate
that
it
is
oakaged
on
the
bottle
nice
to
try
but
there
are
other
old
stand
byes
id
go
to
there
is
much
going
on
here
and
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
some
rich
flavors
blend
nicely
im
impressed
and
look
forward
to
trying
this
one
and
others
from
thomas
hooker
in
the
future
d
the
malty
roasted
bittersweet
chocolate
character
of
a
strong
porter
fused
with
alcohol
and
distinctly
american
hopping
at
nearly
8
abv
this
is
certainly
a
heavyhanded
porter
but
one
to
be
enjoyed
on
its
own
or
perhaps
with
a
slice
of
dark
chocolate
cake
or
torte
drinkability
this
beer
slowly
grew
on
me
falls
somewhere
between
a
traditional
porter
an
english
barleywine
and
an
old
ale
lots
going
on
and
an
incredibly
easy
beer
to
drink
even
with
its
heft
and
richness
good
stuff
d
im
glad
phil
included
two
of
these
this
is
medium
in
the
feel
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
quite
drinkable
with
a
pleasant
roastiness
relatively
speaking
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
from
what
the
aroma
led
on
not
bad
d
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
porter
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
and
would
put
it
toward
the
top
of
the
ones
i
have
tried
d
pretty
good
a
little
boozey
pours
near
black
with
a
light
tan
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
roast
as
well
as
sweetness
with
some
dark
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
coming
through
the
taste
isnt
super
well
integrated
and
looses
some
nuances
from
the
nose
mild
cherry
flavor
and
good
chocolate
and
coffee
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
drinks
fairly
well
but
nowhere
near
the
doppelbock
a
great
beer
to
sit
and
sip
for
a
while
just
be
wary
of
the
deceptive
alcohol
content
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
it
doesnt
drink
hot
for
almost
8
in
fact
drinks
pretty
well
in
that
aspect
however
the
sticky
mouth
feel
that
coats
the
mouth
combined
with
that
minerality
salty
like
flavor
that
starts
to
bombard
after
a
while
if
it
wasnt
for
that
minerality
flavor
this
beer
would
probably
break
into
the
a
rating
range
12oz
bottle
pours
a
black
as
night
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
very
long
good
lacing
nice
aroma
of
coffee
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
heavy
flavor
of
the
coffee
and
malt
again
sweet
caramel
finish
ill
be
taking
my
time
to
enjoy
this
beer
this
has
baltic
porter
written
all
over
it
both
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
very
good
example
of
the
style
plenty
of
chocolately
malt
flavor
good
introduction
of
hop
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
short
and
features
the
darker
malts
not
hops
very
thin
for
the
style
fullbodied
with
light
effervescence
warming
with
a
dryish
finish
please
may
i
have
more
though
at
9
50
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
a
1
brown
head
on
top
of
an
almost
opaque
dark
brown
brew
with
slightly
translucent
edges
lacing
is
prevalent
but
quickfalling
aroma
is
tons
of
dark
grains
with
both
coffee
and
chocolate
apparent
taste
is
dominated
by
the
dark
malt
sweetness
upfront
but
gives
way
to
some
pervasive
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
well
as
nice
as
i
remembered
nuthin
better
than
some
dog
whisperer
and
a
snifter
of
imperial
porter
good
times
this
one
pours
a
straightly
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
spruce
tips
pine
rich
toffee
cocoa
blackened
biscuits
rye
bread
and
a
hint
of
cashews
the
taste
is
pretty
darkly
roasted
and
charred
malts
biscuits
caramel
coffee
feel
the
darkness
apparently
all
of
this
roast
and
char
leaves
a
slightly
stinging
bitterness
that
even
leans
toward
the
sour
end
of
the
spectrum
some
light
pine
and
citrus
notes
get
lost
in
the
mob
as
well
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
dry
feel
overall
i
think
this
guy
overdoes
it
with
the
roast
a
bit
but
beyond
that
everything
seems
pretty
dern
solid
drinkability
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
why
not
get
a
4pack
i
asked
myself
and
of
course
i
decided
for
just
the
one
bottle
its
not
the
end
of
the
world
i
know
but
this
is
a
brew
that
almost
begs
to
not
be
a
sipper
however
it
seems
like
it
very
well
could
be
which
it
shouldnt
and
theres
the
rub
i
havent
seen
it
at
too
many
places
so
if
i
encounter
it
again
you
know
ill
be
buying
more
delicious
and
a
perfect
selection
for
the
upcoming
cold
weather
and
rain
thats
upon
us
d
excellent
not
exactly
what
id
call
a
warm
weather
thirst
quencher
but
this
sure
does
stick
to
the
ribs
bought
a
4
pack
of
this
for
8
99
and
man
oh
man
is
this
a
fantastic
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
nice
white
head
to
it
aroma
is
very
roasty
nutty
and
a
faint
hops
taste
is
medium
to
full
bodied
tons
of
taste
to
this
one
get
some
great
roastiness
some
good
caramel
notes
possibly
even
some
coffee
and
chocolate
too
along
with
a
balance
of
good
hops
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
kick
but
it
all
goes
together
so
well
just
a
great
beer
at
the
end
of
an
evening
way
too
drinkable
and
damn
delicious
recommend
this
one
for
sure
d
not
sure
whether
this
should
have
come
from
a
pint
or
a
snifter
a
hefty
tastefeel
and
an
fairly
weighty
alcoholic
girth
lead
me
to
think
this
worthy
of
the
latter
a
welldone
brew
by
the
folks
at
thomas
hooker
really
worthy
of
seeking
d
a
very
nice
porter
i
thought
it
tasted
great
and
was
very
well
balanced
would
definitely
try
again
d
delicious
stuff
that
was
priced
nicely
at
around
104pk
i
will
most
certainly
be
pulling
the
other
bottles
out
of
the
cellar
for
more
immediate
consumption
these
puppies
are
tasty
as
hell
fresh
and
i
cant
see
them
getting
much
better
with
age
not
sure
what
was
wrong
with
this
to
me
as
i
usually
love
porters
this
one
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
little
head
smelled
of
sweet
raosted
caramel
malt
and
some
hop
bitterness
taste
was
of
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
dry
bread
more
bitter
than
i
like
from
a
porter
but
can
see
how
its
balanced
nicely
quite
heavy
on
the
palette
but
nice
carbonation
i
will
give
this
another
chance
as
maybe
my
pallette
was
off
just
not
my
thing
that
day
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
really
enjoyed
imperial
porter
one
maybe
two
at
a
time
would
likely
suffice
as
its
fairly
hefty
i
wouldnt
at
all
mind
getting
to
try
this
one
again
recommend
the
imp
porter
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
after
an
aggressive
pour
smell
is
dominated
with
malt
characteristics
some
chocolate
and
coffee
are
present
as
well
as
raisins
taste
is
fairly
light
with
a
nice
lingering
burnt
coffee
taste
plenty
of
malts
are
also
present
on
the
palate
with
a
fruit
sweetness
a
good
tasting
american
porter
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
but
well
carbonated
this
is
one
drinkable
porter
abv
is
well
hidden
and
taste
is
really
good

dark

aroma
with
some
light

dark

and
a
touch

big

coffee
flavor
that
melds
into
a
caramel
note
through
the
finish
substantial
acidity
maybe
a
little
too
much
theres
something
about
this
that
lets
you
know
that
its
a
lager
although
im
not
sure
i
can
put
my
finger
on
it
nice
bitter
finish
otherwise
pretty
clean
i
dig
it
drinkability
is
also
good
by
no
means
a
chore
or
a
choke
down
just
not
my
fave
porter
but
a
unique
take
im
glad
to
have
sampled
cheers
for
the
interesting
extra
medium
bodied
with
a
very
low
level
of
carbonation
the
roasted
burnt
quality
lingers
through
the
finish
i
wouldnt
see
having
a
couple
of
these
back
to
back
but
it
was
interesting
to
try
at
least
they
arent
producing
the
infectionprone
swingtops
anymore
very
good
brew
glad
to
try
it
in
the
new
4pack
version
after
being
scared
away
from
the
fliptops
for
so
long
will
probably
visit
again
though
it
wont
be
a
regular
based
on
some
of
the
other
more
recent
reviews
and
my
own
experience
as
compared
to
the
overall
rating
and
some
of
the
older
reviews
i
wonder
what
has
happened
to
this
beer
clearly
it
was
a
great
beer
once
but
the
one
in
my
glass
is
not
the
burned
flavor
just
kills
it
masking
the
other
flavors
and
giving
it
an
unpleasant
bitter
astringency
maybe
they
should
bring
back
the
swingtops
afterall
d
not
bad
there
is
a
lot
of
dark
sugar
character
but
for
some
reason
it
never
seems
to
really
come
together
there
is
an
odd
spiciness
that
i
pick
up
in
the
aroma
and
that
really
jumps
out
in
the
aftertaste
the
cola
sweetness
sticks
around
too
long
and
makes
the
beer
seem
cloying
rather
than
complex
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
once
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
imperial
anything
but
the
wave
of
booze
in
the
beginning
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
second
half
of
this
beer
has
wonderful
flavor
and
it
would
probably
mix
nicely
with
an
ipa
for
an
interesting
black
and
tan
i
would
not
recommend
spending
10
on
a
4
pack
of
these
guys
to
anyone
as
it
is
just
not
complex
enough
overpriced
for
being
ordinary
di
could
maybe
have
a
few
of
these
but
its
well
balance
taste
it
thrown
off
by
the
huge
alcohol
taste
to
it
mouthdrink
mouth
is
thick
and
smooth
drinkability
is
low
because
this
beer
is
filling
and
the
somewhat
high
alcohol
kicks
in
quick
drinkability
well
since
i
never
had
this
beer
fresh
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
either
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
after
4
years
or
i
just
dont
like
it
much
the
nose
if
fantastic
but
the
taste
is
extremely
disappointing
its
too
sweet
and
its
still
slightly
warming
oh
well
interesting
nonetheless
thanks
whoever
you
are
drinkability
a
nice
high
alcohol
creamy
sweet
brown
ale
i
do
want
several
and
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
four
pack
very
complex
for
the
style
d
simply
incredible
4
5
overall
a
very
drinkable
porter
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
enjoy
thanks
andrew
good
beer
little
different
from
most
porters
ive
had
but
good
id
get
it
again
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
slightly
creamy
drinkability
is
good
i
really
liked
this
porter
it
had
a
lot
of
very
big
and
bold
flavors
that
worked
together
very
well
very
good
porter
in
my
opinion
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again

reviewing
a
fresh
nonbarrelaged
bottle
12oz
capped
no
longer
the
swingtop
the
oxidation
has
disappeared
making
this
more
drinkable
but
i
find
the
abv
to
be
more
forward
and
the
roast
levels
a
bit
higher
than
i
remember
better
retention
and
lacing
with
this
fresh
bottle
and
more
cocoa
in
the
nose
dthe
prominence
of
the
smoky
charred
malt
makes
this
beer
a
one
and
done
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
is
all
i
would
want
and
that
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
thickly
bodied
and
very
filling
could
really
substitue
it
for
dessert
exellent

on

light
smell

powder
taste
was
good
but
not
memorable
dark
chocolate
roasted
barley
and
a
hint
of
anise
noted
did
not
like
the
mouthfeel
though
felt
a
bit
rough
for
a
porter
and
had
a
chalky
characteristic
to
it
would
have
liked
a
smoother
body
abv
was
moderate
but
not
too
high
a
nice
porter
for
a
decent
price
but
i
would
not
pay
premium
prices
for
this
overall
i
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
brewery
their
doppelbock
was
phenomenal
however
both
the
barleywine
and
this
beer
had
way
too
much
fruit
flavor
though
it
was
evident
there
was
a
tasty
beer
underneath
all
the
riffraff
maybe
they
dont
age
well
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
fresh
versions
to
compare
as
someone
who
drinks
their
coffee
black
i
found
this
beer
to
be
right
in
my
sweet
spot
props
to
augustgarage
for
pointing
me
in
the
right
direction
500ml
swingtop
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
one
shade
shy
of
black
with
a
thin
khakicolored
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thick
cluster
of
bubble
and
then
a
soapy
slick
no
lacing
on
this
one
nose
reveals
chocolate
malt
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
suggestion
of
dark
fruit
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
peppery
quality
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
just
shy
of
mediumbodied
with
virtually
no
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
fairly
flavorful
but
i
wonder
if
i
got
an
old
bottle
a
really
nice
beer
very
big
roastiness
extremely
intense
there
is
just
barely
enough
sweetness
to
compliment
the
intense
roast
try
it
if
you
love
strong
dark
coffee
md
medium
bodied
and
surprsingly
still
given
the
rather
large
head
that
formed
drinkability
is
there
but
the
tastes
are
rather
big
which
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
touch
in
my
book
alcohol
provides
a
nice
warming
ive
always
had
mixed
results
with
aging
fliptops
and
i
think
this
is
another
example
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
really
think
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
would
have
been
much
better
fresh
d
a
sipper
drinkability
is
good
it
is
more
drinkable
than
say
smuttynose
robust
porter
but
very
similar
in
style
only
more
caramel
flavors
for
a
higher
price
tag
id
drink
it
again
maybe
they
could
tone
down
their
bottles
and
make
it
a
little
cheaper
d
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
a
very
tasty
sipper
indeed
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
highly
recommended
overall
if
you
like
the
roasty
drier
porters
or
are
just
in
the
mood
for
one
pick
this
one
up
if
the
carbo
was
right
this
could
be
a
fine
porter
for
sure
it
even
still
is
i
feel
bad
giving
it
a
low
score
but
as
it
sits
gotta
do
it
would
love
to
try
this
with
the
minor
fix
a
good
beer
d
nope
thanks
ill
pass
and
drink
a
real
porter
instead

chocolate

flavor
similar

aroma
once
again
dominated
by
roasted
coffee
maltiness
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
this
blackasnight
porter
poured
nicely
into
an
oversized
mug
leaving
a
1fingered
creamy
tan
head
whcih
dissipated
from
the
brew
nice
a
slowly
it
had
a
light
aroma
but
that
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
chilled
the
beer
aromas
did
appear
the
longer
i
let
it
sit
in
the
glass
the
flavor
seemd
a
bit
complex
again
it
could
be
because
the
beer
was
chilled
the
flavor
started
out
sweet
and
then
turned
slightly
sour
then
leaving
behind
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
flavors
did
seem
to
blend
much
better
the
longer
it
sat
in
the
glass
there
was
no
sharp
changes
in
flavor
it
blended
much
better
and
was
more
consistent
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
the
flavors
just
coat
the
palate
and
linger
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
like
other
big
strong
beers
you
cant
drink
this
all
a
fternoon
but
one
beer
can
sit
in
the
glass
for
quite
some
time
allowing
you
to
enjoy
each
sip
a
very
rich
flavor
profile
that
should
be
savored
however
its
tough
to
put
the
glass
down
and
easy
drinker
the
taste
has
a
good
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
with
some
light
coffee
and
some
chocolate
bitterness
but
theres
that
tartness
i
noted
in
the
smell
something
is
amiss
here
me
thinks
i
cant
finish
the
bottle
drinkability
argh
this
one
was
tough
to
finish
all
the
elements
of
the
good
beer
were
there
but
the
funky
tart
salty
metallic
notes
while
not
being
offensive
really
definitely
seeming
out
of
place
in
an
imperial
porter
i
suppose
i
can
stretch
my
imagination
to
imagine
that
the
fruity
notes
and
tart
notes
are
the
finish
of
bitter
roasted
coffee
notes
astringencies
etc
and
the
alcohol
isnt
bad
but
still
it
seems
like
this
thomas
hooker
whose
swing
tops
i
loved
but
which
is
notorious
for
infected
bottles
might
just
be
infected
ill
give
it
another
chance
next
time
i
see
it
has
promise
drinkability
it
was
pretty
much
a
standard
roasted
porter
in
an
expensive
bottle
2
years
worth
of
age
didnt
really
do
anything
for
this
beer
that
lead
me
to
believe
that
i
should
have
probably
drank
this
porter
fresh
is
it
worth
a
shot
yeah
go
ahead
and
give
this
beer
a
shot
for
a
porter
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
a
great
brew
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
my
friends
pleepleus
and
hyland
i
think
its
better
that
way
enjoyed
this
one
with
the
mox
and
the
monkey
poured
from
a
cool
lookin
swing
top
growler
looking
bomber
poured
pitch
black
like
old
motor
oil
with
a
minimal
tan
head
leaving
spotty
lacing
throughout
coffee
smells
with
hints
of
raisin
bitter
coffee
tastes
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
raisin
and
plum
definite
malty
character
came
through
in
the
finish
slightly
thick
oily
mouthfeel
leaving
an
overly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
but
worth
trying
if
your
a
stout
or
porter
fan
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
bottle
that
was
bottled
in
2006
black
with
brown
hues
and
a
tan
bubbly
quarter
inch
head
chocolate
sweet
smell
and
thats
where
the
good
part
ended
sadly
strong
coffe
and
caramel
with
heavy
alcohol
the
heavy
coffee
bitterness
lingers
too
long
this
seems
more
like
a
stout
than
a
porter
i
am
not
a
fan
500
ml
bottle
with
a
flip
top
the
sticker
across
the
top
says
that
it
was
bottled
in
2006
the
pour
reveals
a
black
beer
with
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
a
big
cap
of
tan
colored
foam
sat
on
top
with
ok
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
is
not
strong
but
bitter
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
are
identifiable
on
the
palate
it
is
creamy
and
nice
the
taste
is
roasted
maltmore
coffee
than
chocolate
with
a
bitterness
that
soars
at
the
end
this
beer
is
an
good
imperial
porter
this
could
be
a
case
of
being
disappointed
that
a
beer
isnt
what
you
expected
but
i
just
sampled
the
absolutely
duckrabbit
porter
a
few
weeks
ago
this
was
a
disappointment
on
many
levels
i
have
never
had
this
one
fresh
but
aged
it
is
truly
a
gem
despite
its
meager
appearance
notes
the
slight
sourness
is
actually
somewhat
enjoyable
though
its
clearly
not
what
the
beer
was
intended
to
taste
like
a
massive
four
finger
head
is
quick
to
build
fat
rocky
dark
tan
bubbles
krackle
and
leave
scattered
lace
as
the
head
fades
body
is
as
black
as
stout
yielding
not
light
nose
is
smokey
and
robust
with
meaty
malt
notes
and
dusting
of
spicey
zest
enters
the
mouth
with
a
dark
rich
bitter
dryness
is
much
like
dark
chocolate
or
coco
powder
tones
of
coffee
are
of
course
noticeable
hints
of
soured
dark
fruits
almost
reflect
a
tannin
like
feel
as
it
warms
it
does
show
a
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
you
get
a
browny
like
rechness
that
leads
into
a
rich
thick
lovely
mouthfeel
this
is
as
dark
as
a
porter
gets
and
im
thankful
for
that
a
real
joy
to
drink
and
a
true
brewing
success
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
the
caramel
slowly
comes
into
the
picture
and
lingers
long
after
some
interesting
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
not
intensely
coffeeish
but
some
contribute
a
little
drinks
very
easy
for
the
style
heft
not
great
but
close
to
it
wowza
i
did
not
expect
this
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
but
what
a
pleasant
surprise
a
truly
great
brew
from
hooker
this
review
is
from
notes
taken
three
days
ago
ive
since
bought
more
of
these
to
stash
in
the
cellar
d
one
was
quite
enough
for
me
i
think
that
in
the
process
of
making
this
an
imperial
they
lost
the
porter
characteristics
poured
out
of
a
bottle
at
the
flying
pig
in
malvern
pa
into
a
tulip
glass
poured
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
bitterness
burnt
toast
taste
was
chocolate
sweet
and
smokey
malt
with
a
tangy
hop
bitterness
that
was
almost
metallic
a
fantastic
imperial
porter
that
i
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
was
no
flying
dog
gonzo
but
this
a
great
imperial
porter
only
had
two
thomas
hookers
beers
now
but
they
were
both
enjoyable
would
drink
again
if
possible
in
the
future
recommended
pours
a
dark
brown
black
color
with
a
small
foamy
tan
head
light
retention
and
no
lacing
only
an
oily
residue
smells
incredible
with
lots
of
caramel
some
dark
fruit
notes
honey
chocolate
coffee
and
even
some
alcohol
presence
taste
is
of
caramel
chocolate
coffee
and
smoke
with
a
citrus
and
alcohol
finish
medium
in
body
with
low
carbonation
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
a
good
sipper
but
definitely
not
something
i
could
session
overall
this
is
a
brilliant
porter
its
hard
to
do
a
porter
well
but
th
has
done
it
well
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
taste
is
very
interesting
this
is
the
hoppiest
porter
i
have
ever
tasted
wow
the
flavors
interact
well
on
this
beer
a
super
porter
highly
recommended
two
cost
me
8
per
pint
ill
be
in
the
poorhouse
once
im
well
acquainted
with
this
wonderful
porter
pours
a
near
black
in
color
smell
has
some
subdued
hops
in
the
nose
and
some
caramel
malt
taste
is
rather
lacking
but
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
wonderful
full
creamy
and
velvety
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
to
warrant
a
good
score
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
large
fluffy
head
that
wouldnt
quit
aroma
held
some
surprises
alcohol
yeast
plums
cherries
some
caramel
some
citrusy
hops
taste
of
alcohol
roasted
coffees
and
chocolate
and
some
more
dried
fruits
some
grapefruit
and
pine
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
lots
of
carbonation
nice
brew
all
around
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
great
sipper
nonetheless
d
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
the
problems
with
with
beer
come
from
the
fact
that
has
just
been
aged
to
long
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
batch
sometime
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
overall
i
expected
much
more
in
terms
of
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
almost
completely
opaque
brown
with
a
thick
coffee
colored
head
aroma
is
strongly
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
nice
nutty
background
the
chocolate
stands
out
the
most
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
roasted
malts
the
coffee
is
more
noticable
in
the
aftertaste
lingering
for
a
while
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
just
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
that
becomes
more
noticable
as
it
warms
pours
a
really
nice
dark
brown
from
the
bottle
with
a
nice
thick
brown
head
it
has
a
beautiful
carmely
chocolatey
roasted
grainy
aroma
that
really
engulfs
the
drinker
it
tastes
excellent
it
has
a
really
good
complex
flavor
that
blends
the
malts
together
with
a
chocolatey
and
caramely
taste
it
has
a
tiny
hint
of
how
alcoholic
it
is
in
the
end
but
it
is
indeed
a
superb
beer
it
has
a
rich
and
velvety
mouthfeel
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
due
to
its
gravity
it
is
not
as
drinkable
as
others
rather
dry
in
the
flavor
but
a
delight
to
sip
this
spills
over
into
baltic
porter
territory
sit
and
sip
this
one
for
awhile
in
order
to
really
know
how
to
experience
it
sweetnesses
turn
out
to
be
too
much
for
me
in
order
for
me
to
consider
this
really
mind
blowing
good
stuff
to
be
sure
but
for
my
money
ill
take
anchor
porter
instead
pretty
good
overall
pours
an
opaque
brown
some
red
edges
to
it
very
thick
tan
head
forms
lots
of
lacing
settles
to
a
thick
layer
looks
great
smell
is
neat
lactic
sourness
roast
cherries
chocolate
toffee
kind
of
light
but
nice
taste
is
roasty
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
toffee
sour
lactic
cherries
cedar
woodiness
very
earthy
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
tasty
and
drinkable
thanks
a
ton
april
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
still
plenty
of
good
carbonation
here
easy
enough
to
drink
a
tasty
porter
for
sure
i
only
have
one
500ml
bottle
of
this
left
and
thats
probably
all
i
will
ever
have
ill
report
back
on
a
fresher
bottle
when
i
crack
it
creamy
on
the
mouth
with
a
very
well
disguised
alcoholic
content
this
one
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
bittersweet
chocolate
unsweetened
coffee
then
some
mild
sugary
malt
notes
and
perhaps
even
some
hoppy
bitterness
edit
after
reviewing
this
beer
i
noted
that
it
was
my
400th
review
i
just
wanted
to
mention
that
i
think
it
was
fitting
that
milestone
d
quite
nice
less
carbonation
would
make
this
one
a
winner
worth
drinking
again
the
beer
is
opaque
ebony
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
reminiscent
of
perkinos
hammer
or
okocim
the
taste
is
great
too
but
maybe
a
little
more
bitter
or
astringent
than
the
aforementioned
great
baltic
porters
tasty
and
rich
best
as
a
sipping
beer
drinkability
very
tasty
big
and
malty
big
and
hoppy
big
and
alcoholic
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
pours
a
five
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
traces
of
lace
totally
black
color
good
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
roasted
coffee
nose
flavor
is
roasted
coffeechocolate
with
a
burnt
coffee
finish
and
lingering
bakers
chocolate
aftertaste
pricey
at
9
25
for
a
500ml
flip
top
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
at
first
taste
i
thought
g
d
delicious
500ml
bottle
purchased
in
ri
hooker
puts
stoppers
in
their
larger
bottles
which
are
very
handy
for
resealing
and
saving
for
later
pours
a
dark
blackishbrown
with
creamy
foam
that
stays
around
doesnt
pack
a
strong
aroma
but
makes
up
for
it
with
taste
coffee
coffee
coffee
is
what
comes
through
if
youre
a
starbucks
fan
youll
love
this
other
undertones
of
roast
malt
and
chocolate
but
coffee
is
the
overwhelming
flavor
very
smooth
no
bitter
aftertaste
finished
the
whole
500ml
in
one
sitting
a
worldclass
find
on
a
recent
atlanta
visit
the
beer
pours
no
it
plops
into
the
glass
with
a
solid
and
weightyness
releasting
an
abundance
of
carbonation
later
settling
into
a
firm
dark
brown
hue
with
a
1
foamstand
that
accompanied
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
moderate
but
well
balanced
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
milk
chocolate
lactofermentations
and
a
hint
of
berry
tartness
flavors
are
nearly
as
balanced
with
the
weight
of
the
beer
falling
on
the
chocolate
side
balanced
with
enough
flavor
grassy
earthy
hops
to
make
the
beer
pleasantly
palatable
full
and
rich
textures
conclude
with
a
velvety
finish
and
a
lingering
coffeelike
bitterness
i
can
certainly
see
why
this
beer
is
among
the
best
of
ba
a
top
shelf
beverage
experience
enhanced
by
the
quality
swingover
lid
a
nice
warmer
recommended
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
beer
that
packs
this
much
flavor
it
is
eerily
drinkable
whether
warm
or
cold
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
towering
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wondeful
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
and
crystal
malts
as
well
as
some
black
malts
as
well
it
has
an
earthy
feel
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
rich
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
residual
sweetness
it
has
a
nice
black
patentcoffee
like
finish
its
incredibly
smooth
with
excellent
carameel
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
excellent
porter
its
robust
and
full
of
malty
goodness
a
damn
good
drinker
ive
looking
forward
to
this
one
for
some
time
this
beer
poured
black
with
a
huge
tan
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
is
bold
and
roasted
it
is
bitter
coffee
but
balanced
well
with
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sticky
this
is
a
delightful
beer
that
ill
hopefully
enjoy
again
soon
drinkability
is
excellent
well
balanced
the
nearly
8
abv
is
almost
completely
hidden
a
fairly
big
beer
but
quite
enjoyable
really
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
thanks
again
jason
a
swingtop
bottled
in
2006
and
cellared
for
6
months
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
was
black
with
a
thick
mocha
head
goodlooking
beer
it
had
an
intensely
chocolate
aroma
taste
was
similar
very
chocolate
at
times
i
felt
like
i
was
eating
a
brownie
my
only
small
quibble
was
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
carbonated
that
aside
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
drinkability
is
good
nice
porter
i
prefer
a
few
others
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
one
the
alcohol
close
to
8
hides
like
a
car
jacker
in
the
bushes

but
you
know
in
the
end
you
got
jacked
up
yummy
poured
into
a
chalice
a
clean
deep
dark
brown
color
not
much
carbonation
no
head
or
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
slight
alcohol
nice
touch
of
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
very
malt
but
with
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
and
lots
of
toffeecaramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
a
nice
imperial
porter
from
this
brewery
highly
recommended
another
nice
beer
from
hooker
and
a
solid
choice
for
an
imperial
porter
sweetness
is
a
bit
prohibitive
in
drinkability
time
to
move
on
after
one
glass
for
my
bombing
from
babydoc
2006
vintage
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
creamy
smooth
and
very
drinkable
well
that
was
just
awesome
an
incredible
beer
of
any
style
and
quite
possible
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
i
will
have
to
ahhh
shucks
do
a
side
by
side
with
my
current
favorite
glbcs
edmund
fitzgerald
but
this
was
just
a
treat
could
see
this
paring
well
with
a
serious
steak
even
a
seasoned
one
highly
recommended
a
truly
great
porter
this
is
definately
a
different
kind
of
porter
that
is
best
saved
to
sip
on
those
special
occasions
of
cool
evenings
overall
an
excellent
seasonal
porter
perfect
for
cool
evenings
in
the
fallwinter
robust
enough
to
handle
a
cigar
drinkability
i
feel
buzzed
almost
instantly
but
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
abv
is
everpresent
but
not
disturbing
of
the
flavor
nor
does
it
cause
any
heaviness
or
cloyingness
i
would
say
as
good
as
it
gets
bottle

imtheoptimator

hazy
slightly
dirty
yellow
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
estery
yeast
and
spices
is
quite
dominant
as
well
as
some
tropical
fruit
like
sweetness
taste
is
spicier
then
i
would
have
expected
which
might
be
from
the
spice
mix
use
in
this
beer
or
from
the
yeast
strain
use
in
this
beer
body
is
quite
full
and
alcohol
is
not
discernable
i
thought
this
was
reasonably
well
done
for
the
style
and
would
mind
having
another
taste
of
it
the
flavor
is
malty
with
some
carmelized
malt
spiciness
hint
of
cocoa
and
coffee
lingering
malt
essence
really
good
beer
overall
i
had
fff
alpha
klaus
a
couple
nights
ago
and
this
isnt
quite
on
that
level
for
me
but
very
good
nonetheless
well
worth
seeking
out
snagged
this
not
seemingly
32oz
swingtop
bottle
with
a
2005
sticker
on
it
two
years
old
on
the
shelf
for
about
the
same
price
as
the
nowsmaller
bottles
pours
rather
dark
with
a
small
foamy
light
brown
hued
head
that
fades
for
a
dark
beer
fairly
standard
looking
but
points
for
the
cool
bottle
swingtop
and
label
aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
some
pine
with
sweet
malts
and
roasted
notes
in
the
background
taste
is
dark
smooth
syrupy
and
roasty
without
tasting
gritty
or
charred
and
some
coffee
but
has
a
distinct
earthy
flavor
and
a
lingering
dirty
caramel
malt
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
not
my
favorite
flavor
to
find
in
a
beer
but
reminds
me
a
bit
of
bbc
draymans
and
if
you
like
that
youd
love
this
fair
enough
mouthfeel
is
smooth
carbonation
and
full
bodied
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
drinker
and
the
2005
factor
must
be
at
play
here
somewhat
but
it
seems
like
the
main
characteristics
are
intact
here
more
so
just
not
my
style
glad
i
tried
it
and
got
the
32
oz
size
even
i
was
surprised
how
well
and
how
long
the
swingtop
preserved
it
as
i
could
only
do
half
the
bottle
one
pint
at
first
due
both
the
abv
and
not
loving
the
flavors
then
i
sealed
and
reopened
it
multiple
times
till
i
finished
it
over
the
next
two
days
and
yes
it
was
loosing
some
carbonation
but
everytime
i
reopened
it
the
carbonation
still
popped
and
it
wasnt
at
all
flat
when
i
finished
it
off
nice
thanks
to
mcallister
for
sharing
this
great
brew
solid
black
in
color
thick
tan
head
which
held
together
for
the
life
of
the
brew
big
milk
chocolate
aroma
some
burnt
caramel
and
soft
citrusy
hops
the
flavor
seems
to
be
more
dark
chocolate
and
slightly
roasty
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
finish
full
body
lower
carbonation
more
caramel
flavors
come
out
as
this
one
warms
great
amount
of
different
chocolate
characteristics
very
full
of
flavor
this
is
a
gem
not
crazy
about
this
one
but
i
will
try
another
to
age
a
bit
drinkability
another
beer
to
be
sipped
upon
very
smooth
and
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
sit
down
with
and
chill
the
taste
of
the
malts
linger
on
the
palette
for
a
long
while
i
will
definately
be
adding
this
to
the
my
list
of
standbys
the
color
is
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
a
nice
1
big
coffee
hints
at
chocolate
and
coffee
started
to
overtake
as
aging
may
well
make
this

i

it
until
i
stepped
away
from

chair
i
was
in
this
was
a
good
beer
on
a
cold
winter
evening
worth
the
price
for
a
big
burly
inebriating
beer
on
a
side
note
i
dont
really
like
these
liter
bottles
dogwood
and
sweetwater
use
them
for
their
winter
beers
but
the
way
the
neck
bulges
it
makes
it
impossible
to
pour
without
glugging
the
beer
in
beers
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
like
this
its
not
that
big
of
a
deal
as
the
agitation
doesnt
send
the
head
out

with
a
more
highly
carbonated
beer
this
could
prove
problematic

the

this
beer
is
a
beautiful
creation
excellent
as
close

as
i
have
found
and
right

tight

aroma

taste

coffee
dark

smooth
on

not

cloying
and
finishes
beautifully
dry
an
wonderful
brew
and
i
will
need
to
track
down
some
more
love
the
litre
bottle
too
the
beer
is
only
medium
bodied
i
would
have
expected
a
little
more
thickness
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
had
a
chance
to
sample
this
on
tap
as
well
definitely
worth
tryingpicking
up
if
you
see
it
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
very
few
beers
thats
better
than
the
original
this
porter
exceeded
my
high
expectations
and
then
some
ill
be
hoarding
this
stuff
for
the
rest
of
the
year
beautiful
deep
dark
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
really
active
nose
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
bean
with
a
hint
of
leafy
hops
taste
is
awesome
from
first
sip
unbelievable
rich
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
bean
with
really
nice
sweet
undertow
of
caramel
and
bittersweet
chocolate
and
if
that
isnt
enough
there
is
a
really
nice
hop
finish
that
has
tartness
reminiscent
of
a
really
strong
fresh
espresso
the
hops
in
this
really
make
it
awesome
this
beer
had
a
really
drinkable
quality
and
no
syrupy
or
heavy
finish
you
might
expect
with
such
a
big
beer
and
style
this
is
a
limited
release
and
i
can
kick
myself
for
only
buying
two
bottles
served
on
tap
at
eli
cannons
tonight
in
a
nice
full
pint
glass
for
the
bargain
price
of
3

i
was
very
happy
to
see
this
on
tap
as
ive
been
dying
to
try
it
now
i
want
more
the
hooker
imperial
porter
arrived
in
my
glass
a
deep
midnight
black
with
just
traces
of
dark
tan
foam
on
top
moderate
carbonation
a
fresh
hop
aroma
greets
you
at
first
then
is
overtaken
by
strong
scents
of
coffee
and
roastiness
taste
is
very
much
coffeeis
and
roasty
at
first
then
some
nice
hop
bitterness
comes
in
to
complement
the
roasted
malt
becomes
sweeter
toward
the
end
with
hints
of
raisin
and
just
a
bit
of
nice
alcohol
warmth
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
big
porter
excellent
brew
from
troutbrook
not
our
favorite
did
not
age
well
at
all
o
pretty
good
and
i
suspect
this
improves
with
age
based
on
the
reviews
i
was
given
a
bottle
since
i
feel
it
is
kinda
pricey
compared
to
other
brewery
offerings
if
it
is
ever
on
sale
it
is
worth
picking
up
o
not
sure
how
the
age
affected
this
but
it
must
have
been
for
the
better
because
there
is
no
way
that
the
beer
i
just
drank
deserved
a
3
69
the
current
overall
rating
probably
coupled
with
the
fact
that
leinenkugel
makes
macro
beer
black
in
color
and
impenetrable
to
light
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
foam
sits
on
top
of
the
vast
majority
of
this
beer
i
smell
plenty
of
dark
malt
and
dry
grains
the
taste
is
comprised
of
dark
smoked
malt
the
mouth
is
thick
and
yet
viscous
pours
cloudy
dark
brown
with
quickly
fading
razor
thin
head
aroma
is
of
rich
roasted
caramel
malt

notes
and
a
mild
roasted

mild
dark
fruit
on
the
backend
overall
this
quite
a
good
and
tasty
baltic
porter
i
like
astringency
odd
but
decent
tastes
of
sour
fruits
dates
plums
pomegranate
licorice
very
sour
not
sweet
at
all
like
one
would
expect
from
the
style
followed
by
toffee
caramel
and
dark
fruits
finishes
with
almost
a
vinaigrette
quality
beautiful
flavor
profile
this
is
more
like
a
sour
wild
ale
than
a
porter
very
fruity
and
very
sour
amazing
beverage
way
underrated
in
my
opinion
o
too
sweet
for
me
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
anywhere
close
to
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
classic
baltic
porters
which
have
tended
to
have
more
roastiness
and
dark
fruits
this
is
just
sweet
cloying
without
even
close
to
enough
balance
overall
way
too
sweet
little
overall
complexity
for
the
price
i
will
not
purchase
again
sloppy
job
by
the
brewers
overall
overall
a
decent
baltic
porter
average
looking
with
a
fruity
mellow
nose
tastes
of
very
sweet
dark
fruits
and
mellow
chocolate
malts
with
a
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
not
anything
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
recommend
for
fans
of
the
style
it
held
up
better
than
expected
in
its
two
years
overall
a
nice
balanced
porter
would
be
better
with
a
little
more
body
a
good
drinkable
beer
sourcing
purchased
at
specs
in
georgetown
texas
in
january
of
2014
priced
at
10
49
plus
tax
for
a
4pack
of
twelveounce
bottles
overall
this
beer
is
more
prominently
acidic
and
sour
aka
plumskins
with
slight
roast
and
smoke
far
in
the
background
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
with
nice
balance
and
complexity
i
would
recommend
sipping
this
one
a
bit
more
slowly
as
the
flavors
open
up
nicely
as
it
warms
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
bit
off
for
the
style
but
still
enjoyable
and
recommended
o
the
nose
on
this
beer
kills
it
it
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
ive
ever
had
kinda
thin
and
the
appearance
is
light
other
than
that
world
class
o
enjoyable
beer
nice
take
on
the
style
rjt
overall
wow
is
this
really
leinenkugel
this
is
a
pretty
solid
baltic
porter
with
some
age
on
it
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
only
my
second
of
the
big
eddy
series
after
the
imperial
ipa
but
i
think
i
need
to
try
more
worth
a
shot
12
ounce
bottle
into

pours
crystal
clear
very
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
12
finger
dense
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
nice
soapy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
toast
toffee
chocolate
brown
bread
molasses
raisin
prune
nuttiness
light
roast
and
toasted
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
of
dark
malt
notes
with
moderate
fruitiness
and
good
strength
taste
of
caramel
molasses
toast
toffee
chocolate
brown
bread
raisin
prune
light
roast
nuttiness
and
toasted

no
bitterness
on
the

of
caramel
molasses
toast
toffee
chocolate
brown
bread
dark
fruit
nuttiness
light
roast
and
toasted
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
darktoasted
malt
flavors
with
moderate
fruitiness
and
zero
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
lightmedium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
darktoasted
malt
flavors
with
moderate
fruitiness
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
good
baltic
porter
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
style
still
a
good
beer
for
a
surprisingly
cool
summer
evening
starts
off
slow
but
really
gathers
itself
into
a
nice
beer
the
style
doesnt
always
work
for
me
and
i
had
this
pegged
as
a
loser
early
on
but
it
really
shines
ones
you
take
a
sip
strange
i
am
not
sure
what
to
think
about
this
beer
the
smell
was
amazing
it
smelled
like
a
rich
complex
fruity
malty
stout
the
taste
had
some
of
these
same
aspects
but
there
was
just
something
missing
and
i
couldnt
tell
exactly
what
it
was
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
as
well
i
usually
give
everything
in
the
big
eddy
series
a
try
since
leinenkugels
being
a
state
brewery
but
this
one
was
missed
out
on
something
in
trying
to
be
a
great
beer
overall
not
a
bad
baltic
overall
there
are
lots
of
port
and
dark
fruit
flavors
swirling
within
this
one
creating
a
rather
fruity
and
sweet
brew
overall
not
the
worst
porter
i
ever
had
but
not
bad
for
some
bmc
wanna
bees
i
would
get
it
again
if
i
found
a
10
dollar
six
pack
an
extra
in
a
trade
i
think
beerenberger
creamy
full
bodied
somewhat
rich
and
slick
overall
though
this
is
quite
a
bit
off
kilter
for
a
baltic
porter
which
makes
it
hard
to
enjoy
it
as
such
i
can
definitely
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
leinenkugel
although
im
not
completely
sold
and
certainly
not
at
the
going
rate
theres
still
that
something
thats
just
missing
not
really
standoutish
in
any
form
and
so
what
are
you
really
missing
o
honestly
i
like
this
but
nothing
is
bursting
through
nose
is
underwhelming
taste
is
pleasant
but
you
keep
hoping
for
more
specifically
aged
fruit
gotta
bring
that
out
more
big
eddy
are
leinenkugels
best
brews
but
they
seem
to
always
fall
just
a
step
short
of
that
excellent
level
this
falls
into
another
brew
that
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
brag
about
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
light
brown
head
the
aroma
gives
it
that
scent
like
its
been
aged
in
a
sherry
barrel
with
a
mild
fruitiness
of
plums
the
texture
is
smooth
and
creamy
there
are
lots
of
complex
roasted
and
smoky
flavors
finishes
ever
so
crisp
not
too
bad
but
theres
also
room
for
improvement
overall
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
interesting
than
most
leinenkugel
brews
but
the
taste
is
not
quite
right
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
at
best
example
of
a
baltic
porter
it
just
seemed
much
more
like
a
wee
heavy
since
it
really
didnt
have
any
of
those
nice
roasted
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
even
though
the
flavors
werent
true
to
style
they
still
held
my
attention
but
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
crack
open
another
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
actually
nice
it
just
wasnt
true
to
style
and
it
lacked
the
roasted
aromas
that
i
was
looking
for
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
tasted
much
more
like
a
wee
heavy
than
a
baltic
porter
where
did
all
the
roasted
malts
go
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
much
rather
have
a
thirsty
trout
porter
from
dark
horse
its
a
little
cheaper
and
its
much
truer
to
style
and
tastier
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
a
good
baltic
porter
all
in
all
i
was
let
down
with
this
beer
it
didnt
taste
bad
but
it
wasnt
what
i
expect
from
the
style
and
it
was
really
missing
the
roasted
malts
as
a
key
component
of
this
beer
so
far
i
havent
been
impressed
with
any
of
this
beers
from
the
big
eddy
series
and
this
one
is
no
different
im
starting
to
lose
hope
with
the
series
but
i
hope
the
dipa
is
better
than
the
rest
better
luck
next
time
guys
o
such
a
rich
chewy
porter
a
touch
of
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
though
its
pretty
well
masked
another
nice
offering
from
the
big
eddy
series
o
creamy
rich
darkly
sweet
and
an
unusual
departure
from
most
of
thier
offerings
thankfully
theres
not
much
from
leinenkugel
that
impresses
me
this
is
a
good
start
along
with
thier
ris
unfortunately
thats
where
things
end
as
well
up
next
is
thier
ipa
so
maybe
three
for
three
a
good
but
some
may
say
overly
sweet
baltic
porter
but
may
be
worthy
a
single
purchase
to
give
this
brewery
some
redemption
this
is
a
tasty
little
sucker
that
triumphs
over
a
rather
weak
appearance
and
feel
the
flavor
balance
is
a
tad
out
of
whack
too
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
unacceptable
i
just
would
have
liked
a
more
robust
malt
character
to
bring
about
more
balance
and
to
tame
some
of
the
rough
edges
trying
the
big
eddy
porter
following
a
surprise
soirée
for
my
cuzs
40th
the
big
eddy
is
opaque
in
color
with
thin
ecru
head
that
is
not
lacing
much
the
scent
carries
peatearthy
tones
with
touches
of
coffeeespresso
the
taste
starts
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
them
a
healthy
peat
malt
semi
sweet
kicks
in
through
the
finish
to
make
this
a
decent
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
porter
if
i
were
to
change
anything
it
would
be
to
add
a
little
more
body
and
a
touch
more
of
caramel
and
roasts
malt
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
go
to
for
myself
pours

this
is
a
nice
beer
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
very
drinkable
and
really
quite
tasty
there
is
quite
a
bit
packed
in
here
but
it
is
balanced
very
nicelyit
isnt
overwhelming
but
isnt
boring
a
nice
drink
that
i
will
probably
buy
again
especially
in
the
fallwinter
as
an
alternative
to
the
spice
beers
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
dark
brown
color
which
does
allow
some
light
through
i
small
amount
of
cream
colored
head
does
arise
but
dissapates
quickly
it
smells
of
molasses
raisins
and
other
dark
fruits
figsdates
tastes
like
you
are
drinking
a
fig
newton
with
well
hidden
booze
it
is
enjoyable
quite
smooth
drinks
more
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
tastes
somewhat
similar
to
chimay
blue
from
my
recollection
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
tumbler
dark
pour
with
a
slight
tan
head
decent
lacing
lots
of
coffee
on
the
nose
very
malty
nice
mix
of
coffee
port
and
dark
fruits
lingering
finish
the
carbonation
is
medium
no
detectable
booze
dangerously
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
good
flavor
and
great
drinkability
mf
nice
full
body
especially
when
this
warms
up
not
too
much
carbonation
but
just
right
a
decent
baltic
porter
worth
a
shot
but
dont
set
your
sights
too
high
d
a
hearty
drink
for
a
hearty
meal
this
needs
to
be
paired
with
something
a
bit
greasy
a
decent
example
of
the
style
not
as
smooth
or
clean
as
okocim
sinebrychoff
carnegie
or
zwyiec
but
still
pretty
tasty
i
would
buy
it
again
but
at
this
price
why
not
just
get
an
okocim
overall
not
quite
as
good
as
the
big
eddy
ris
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
alcohol
and
some
dark
fruit
notes
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
raisin
and
prune
notes
as
well
as
some
molasses
and
roasted
malt
i
also
get
the
slightest
hint
of
smoke
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
and
decent
tasting
take
on
a
baltic
porter
dark
fruit
flavors
are
good
could
of
had
some
more
body
and
smoke
the
big
eddy
baltic
porter
does
all
that
baltic
porters
prescribe
but
the
smoothness
is
met
with
the
abrasioin
of
light
char
the
alcohols
are
slightly
less
refined
and
the
middle
palate
leaves
holes
in
the
flavors
and
textures
that
are
expected
its
a
good
beer
but
the
baltic
porter
taste
is
so
specific
that
this
beer
has
difficult
achieving
overall
well
lets
just
say
i
preferred
the
other
members
of
the
big
eddy
crew
by
margin
wide
enough
to
chuck
some
dirty
nickles
and
a
bottle
of
kikkomans
through
very
good
for
a
baltic
porter
not
up
there
with
the
best
but
not
a
bad
attempt
either
o
sweeter
than
id
expect
for
the
style
but
another
good
offering
from
the
big
eddy
series
this
is
actually
pretty
good
if
this
was
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
think
this
would
get
better
reviews
very
robust
flavors
with
a
balanced
bitter
roast
its
a
tad
sweet
but
its
a
big
beer
with
tons
of
sticky
flavor
o
this
is
beer
is
pretty
nice
none
of
the
flavors
are
in
your
face
like
many
imperial
porterstouts
it
has
a
simple
aroma
and
flavor
profile
and
it
is
easy
drinking
i
wouldnt
trade
it
in
for
some
of
my
favorite
big
stouts
but
i
think
it
represents
the
baltic
porter
style
nicely
pretty
cheap
i
think
i
paid
around
2
for
the
single
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
porter
purist
o
not
a
bad
example
of
a
baltic
porter
but
ive
had
a
lot
better
examples
i
think
maybe
its
just
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
overall
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
out
again
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
cola
brown
that
gets
darker
as
it
pool
minimal
head
and
light
carbonation
the
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
with
little
to
no
roast
it
sure
doesnt
smell
like
a
baltic
the
flavors
too
light
for
a
baltic
with
too
much
of
a
cola
flavoring
and
no
roast
it
has
some
scotch
ale
attributes
to
it
also
odd
it
is
also
too
light
in
body
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bad
representation
of
the
style
it
really
is
more
like
a
wee
heavy
than
a
baltic
porter
it
just
needs
to
be
bigger
and
have
more
to
it
this
was
a
bit
disappointing
the
flavor
was
a
bit
weird
to
me
the
caramel
was
more
prevalent
than
i
would
have
expected
it
seemed
at
odds
with
the
huge
roasted
malt
presence
in
any
case
this
is
probably
worth
a
try
big
eddy
baltic
porter
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
there
wasnt
a
strong
aroma
but
their
were
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
had
a
nice
bold
coffee
flavor
all
on
a
smokey
malty
backbone
a
bit
watery
but
not
of
surprise
from
leinenkugel
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
a
little
watery
but
full
of
nice
flavors
i
havent
had
that
many
baltic
porters
but
ive
tended
to
like
all
that
ive
triedbig
eddys
included
i
wouldnt
put
up
against
my
favorite
riss
but
its
still
a
good
beer
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
ill
age
one
for
a
year
just
to
see
where
it
goes
o
such
an
excellent
beer
big
eddy
series
is
turning
my
head
i
really
have
enjoyed
these
beers
by
jacob
leinenkugel
brewing
co
this
was
delicious
it
actually
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
because
my
expectations
for
the
big
eddy
series
are
now
quite
high
i
actually
expect
a
bit
more
booze
and
bite
in
this
style
but
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
delicious
beer
one
i
could
drink
all
night
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
o
another
maltdriven
concoction
completes
the
series
of
seasonal
big
eddy
beers
and
really
shows
that
theres
serious
brewing
skill
there
theyre
not
just
amateurs
pumping
out
shandy
leinenkugels
big
eddy
baltic
porter
almost
perfectly
nails
the
style
with
its
malt
complexity
showcased
despite
being
a
clean
lager
which
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
percent
its
got
ale
depth
and
character
dont
pass
this
one
up
this
certainly
wasnt
bad
but
its
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
the
others
ive
had
from
the
big
eddy
series
hopefully
the
other
3
i
have
will
develop
more
character
over
time
cheers
looked
good
tasted
like
crap
o
this
would
be
my
goto
pumpkin
beer
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
overall
this
is
an
excellent
excellent
porter
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
in
fact
absolutely
fantastic
if
this
beer
is
released
again
next
year
im
definitely
getting
it
again
good
porter
but
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
of
the
pumpkin
spice
typical
of
the
style
not
my
thing
points
off
for
the
lack
of
pumpkin
however
if
this
was
he
said
baltic
porter
i
think
it
would
be
closer
to
4
25
i
first
had
the
he
saidhe
said
4
pack
in
2013
and
remembered
that
it
was
good
ill
be
sure
to
pick
some
up
every
year
from
now
on
can
shared
with
a
friend
pours
dark
black
with
tan
head
aroma
of
malts
and
spices
taste
of
coffee
nutmeg
and
clove
not
much
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
at
all
dry
finish
very
good
3
655

overall
the
whole
is
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
flavors
are
fighting
here
theres
no
gestalt
its
lacking
a
unifying
theme
or
at
least
once
that
pulls
it
all
together
some
interesting
flavors
but
not
all
of
them
are
pleasant
sorry
ive
gotta
drop
the
points
down
on
this
one
overall
i
say
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
dark
nearly
pitch
black
body
nice
head
formation
with
creamy

colored

which
leaves

im

i
picked
up
a
can
of
each
to
try
the
he
said
he
said
combo
o
this
is
a
nice
thick
beer
and
another
good
showing
for
21st
amendment
the
pumpkin
is
light
but
i
prefer
that
i
would
def
take
the
tripel
over
this
really
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
unique
one
at
that
really
great
use
of
spices
and
it
makes
for
an
interesting
brew
overall
the
baltic
porter
aspect
of
this
beer
struggles
to
shine
but
like
all
elysian
pumpkiny
beers
this
is
pretty
well
done
i
dig
it
o
no
flaws
but
nothing
particularly
exciting
going
on
another
can
from
a
fourpack
purchased
at
pioneer
market
in
la
conner
had
more
foam
but
the
strange
odor
and
plasticky
note
if
i
were
judging
this
as
just
a
baltic
porter
it
might
not
fare
as
well
as
it
does
as
a
pumpkin
baltic
porter
that
deserves
bonus
points
creamy
frothydistinctly
a
porter
rather
than
a
stout
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
picked
this
up
at
a
liquor
store
in
the
boonies
while
traveling
crosscountry
and
im
sad
to
say
i
cant
find
it
anywhere
else
now
great
stuff
a
tasaty
and
imaginative
brew
a
well
done
take
on
a
baltic
porter
though
it
is
certainly
just
as
equally
a
pumpkin
ale
in
taste
in
my
opinion
happy
to
have
another
can
to
enjoy
overall
a
decent
porter
though
im
not
entirely
sure
the
pumpkin
works
as
well
as
i
might
like
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
the
porter
behind
this
beer
with
no
pumpkin
added
overall
good
its
a
pretty
solid
option
for
a
darker
stronger
beer
in
cans
it
could
be
better
though
and
its
lighter
than
you
would
expect
for
the
abv
o
9
3
over
all
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
per
say
well
to
think
of
it
its
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
nice
black
and
tan
type
pour
aroma
of
hints
of
allspice
tiny
bits
of
squash
and
a
bit
of
roasty
malts
flavors
tend
to
be
a
bit
sweet
up
front
then
blending
in
a
bit
of
the
roast
while
kicking
up
the
spice
note
towards
the
finish
pleasant
pumpkiny
flavors
throughout
while
the
lingering
notes
lean
mostly
onto
the
spices
tiniest
hint
of
booze
in
the
finish
as
well
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
think
the
cinnamon
having
more
of
a
presence
that
the
other
spices
worked
nicely
with
the
baltic
porter
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
im
usually
let
down
by
all
things
21st
but
this
one
was
good
o
i
hope
the
tripel
in
the
other
half
of
this
4pack
is
better
than
this
this
ones
just
too
hot
love
the
color
on
this
beer
just
a
hint
of
that
dark
roast
bitter
making
it
through
the
spice
and
sugar
lots
of
cinnamon
and
less
clove
good
call
there
guys
coats
the
tongue
goes
with
food
or
without
try
some
to
wash
down
a
curry
mmmm
overall
nice
brew
interesting
mix
of
pumpkin
and
aromatic
spice
with
the
malty
smokiness
of
a
baltic
overall
im
totally
okay
with
this
beer
really
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
blackish
color
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
and
a
tall
frothy
foamy
chunky
small
bubbled
head
that
sits
a
solid
inch
and
a
half
and
is
creamy
tan
colored
slow
recession
of
the
head
as
you
drink
aromas
of
coffee
roast
earthy
notes
and
subtle
pumpkin
notes
pretty
subtle
notes
past
the
coffee
flavors
are
a
little
more
pumpkin
heavy
with
rich
notes
coming
forward
in
front
of
coffee
bitter
and
roast
as
well
as
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spicing
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
notes
are
present
throughout
the
palate
also
pretty
dynamic
and
more
flavorful
than
i
was
expecting
tasty
brew
robust
flavors
on
a
midbodied
dry
feel
throughout
with
a
tangy
rich
sweet
and
fairly
rigidly
bitter
undertone
all
through
the
aftertaste
the
finish
has
a
subtle
linger
of
bitter
and
sweet
with
more
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
hanging
around
until
the
next
sip
solid
beer
i
appreciate
the
effort
to
make
something
differen
in
a
pumpkin
beer
with
this
one
just
doesnt
work
for
me
o
well
worth
the
try
a
nice
notch
on
the
belt
if
you
will
since
i
have
never
seen
this
until
presented
to
me
o
this
was
pretty
good
but
since
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
competition
is
pretty
fierce
to
my
mind
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
thinner
but
pretty
well
susteined
tannish
colored
head
atop
spiced
aromas
like
nutmegmace
and
cinnamonwith
some
roast
and
a
tinge
of
iron
a
little
fizzy
to
me
in
the
mouth
and
some
what
light
as
well
flavors
of
pumpkin
and
spice
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
standing
out
mainlya
little
chocolate
roast
round
out
the
palate
i
like
the
concept
of
this
beer
but
its
lacking
a
little
my
pour
began
with
an
upright
glug
as
i
did
not
want
any
doubt
remaining
as
to
whether
bro
woody
with
the
order
of
disorder
were
an
upright
soul
this
resulted
in
two
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
betterthanexpected
retention
it
were
witchcraft
and
so
i
were
called
in
to
delve
to
the
bottom
of
this
bloody
and
dismal
swamp
it
were
a
witches
brew
indeed
with
a
deep
murky
brown
color
srm
44
that
burbled
and
popped
until
i
came
near
its
mess
the
smell
emanating
from
it
was
of
hell
itself
roasting
pumpkins
cinnamon
allspice
eye
of
newt
and
tail
of
frog
whoops
satan
got
ahold
of
me
briefly
suddenly
that
temptress
whom
i
cannot
rid
myself
of
memory
the
old
lady
appeared
before
mine
eyes
get
thou
back
thou
reddish
wench
i
cried
out
she
merely
smiled
and
beckoned
me
to
take
a
draught
from
her
chalice
somehow
replacing
mine
own
it
were
as
thick
as
baboons
blood
and
as
spicy
as
her
nether
regions
from
which
i
had
partaken
in
oh
so
many
weak
moments
i
were
naught
but
a
fallen
minister
and
she
straddled
atop
my
mouth
pouring
the
cantents
of
can
after
can
into
mine
orifice
i
cried
for
help
but
none
was
forthcoming
the
light
and
love
that
suddenly
appeared
from
the
glass
demanded
that
i
look
not
directly
upon
it
i
wept
whilst
the
old
lady
laughed
but
she
poured
yon
luscious
beverage
into
mine
gaping
orifice
and
soon
we
were
alone
mine
breath
had
been
taken
away
by
the
perfume
of
the
all
of
the
spices
i
have
no
further
words
for
anyall
of
it
but
words
of
caution
wanderest
down
yon
halls
of
he
said
and
ye
may
find
yeselves
in
yon
same
predicament
as
yon
favorite
pseudomonk
fked
again
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
pumpkin
porters
so
much
so
that
ive
been
known
to
mix
a
pumpkin
beer
with
a
good
roasty
porter
this
one
from
the
collaboration
between
21st
amendment
and
elysian
is
a
good
one
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
elysians
pumpkin
festival
and
their
pumpkin
beers
in
general
this
beer
has
that
pumpkin
silkiness
im
looking
for
coupled
with
some
judicious
pumpkin
pie
spicing
and
a
nice
roastiness
as
a
counterpoint
creamy
finish
this
is
just
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
porter
o
overall
this
does
not
really
have
any
of
the
characteristics
i
would
expect
in
a
baltic
porter
but
it
is
a
really
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
assuming
that
you
enjoy
the
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
well
this
is
definitely
better
than
the
other
he
said
tripel
but
i
do
have
some
issues
its
overly
earthy
and
borderline
dirty
and
there
is
an
odd
amount
of
sweetness
overall
after
having
reviewed
the
he
said
tripel
a
few
hours
ago
i
am
reaching
the
conclusion
that
while
21st
amendment
and
elysian
are
great
breweries
on
an
individual
level
they
do
not
produce
magic
when
collaborating
sorry
mixed
with
the
baltic
porter
he
said
a
far
more
balanced
nose
spices
play
with
pumpkin
to
a
nice
backdrop
of
roast
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
either
alone
and
the
taste
is
again
more
balanced
its
as
though
one
only
tastes
the
best
parts
of
both
brews
the
finish
is
shorter
again
perfectly
balanced
but
at
the
very
end
becomes
just
a
tad
too
vegetal
id
rate
the
mix
at
4
85
it
is
so
incredibly
close
to
the
perfect
pumpkin
beer
o
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
more
like
a
pumpkin
ale
compared
to
a
baltic
porter
but
when
compared
to
pumpkin
beers
the
taste
is
nearly
completely
dominated
by
spices
provided
you
can
handle
the
spices
it
is
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
o
not
bad
but
some
flaws
cooked
vegetables
esp
on
the
aroma
are
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
pumpkin
was
ok
but
a
bit
on
the
cooked
side
baking
spices
and
cocoa
were
nice
ok
beer
but
could
be
better
overall
pretty
good
more
on
the
baltic
porter
than
pumpkin
but
the
spices
mix
in
well
i
only
picked
up
a
single
and
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
probably
wont
revisit
overall
its
got
the
spiced
pumpkin
profile
similar
to
its
tripel
but
its
bitterness
is
really
not
in
control
here
and
doesnt
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
beer
experience
its
ok
overall
a
rather
tasty
brew
overall
very
much
more
on
the
baltic
porter
side
with
just
some
lighter
hints
of
the
pumpkin
pie
tastes
a
rather
enjoyable
sipper
o
the
tannic
bitterness
was
truly
unbearable
and
making
me
gag
way
over
spiced
to
enjoy
any
of
the
good
qualities
that
are
in
the
background

into
a

with

almost
black

notes

spice
strong
spice
with
a
bite
up
front
strong
spice
notes
of
of
cinnamon
allspice
and
cardamom
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
with
a
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
bit
thin
and
dry
for
a
baltic
porter
the
combination
of
roast
and
spice
with
thin
body
lead
to
an
astringent
finish
that
i
dont
love
spices
are
very
strong
in
this
one
i
wanted
so
much
more
from
these
guys
this
is
the
better
of
the
two

the

perhaps
not

overall
a

which
hides

very
well

i

just

overall
a

poured

dark

mahogany

at

a
fine

toasted

pumpkin

well

spicing
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
creaminess
a
very
nicely
balanced
pumpkin
porter
im
not
detecting
the
baltic
portion
of
the
porter
because
of
the
other
flavors
but
that
is
hardly
a
detraction
because
everything
is
very
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
very
nicely
done
both
of
these
he
said
ales
were
excellent
i
hope
these
are
an
annual
event
overall
i
was
thinking
i
was
going
to
like
the
tripel
better
but
i
actually
found
this
to
be
the
better
of
the
two
beers
this
is
not
as
pumpkin
forward
as
some
other
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
but
the
base
baltic
porter
is
really
tasty
i
would
get
this
again
a
very
good
porter
mild
hints
of
the
pumpkin
but
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
it
that
aside
its
quite
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
if
i
read
the
label
better
and
saw
the
word
pumpkin
i
never
would
of
bought
the
he
said
four
pack
turns
out
to
be
a
better
than
average
beer
that
is
just
too
heavy
handed
with
the
spice
worth
a
try
quality
beer
in
a
can
good
stuff
more
traditional
flavors
with
finishing
layers
of
complexity
a
standardly
dry
porter
with
great
chew
oatmeal
bitterness
welldone
roast
dry
cocoa
notes
and
a
lingering
sustain
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
a
little
minerally
with
low
ph
levels
relaxed
body
with
palming
weight
but
not
tension
gives
up
slowly
but
surely
in
the
mouth
with
a
pleasant
release
of
gases
the
body
of
the
beer
is
exceptional
and
really
plants
on
the
taste
receptors
spices
are
overmatched
with
a
great
malt
base
aged
hops
bring
forth
some
young
pine
and
a
twist
of
orange
peel
faint
squashy
taste
that
i
like
an
exceptional
porter
of
the
baltic
style
with
a
seasonal
american
twist
a
fine
drink
for
the
onset
of
colder
weather
could
be
enjoyed
late
into
the
throes
of
winter
the
first
whiff
i
got
of
this
beer
was
quite
promising
in
a
baltic
porter
kind
of
way
but
it
ends
up
being
a
wad
of
spices
in
a
more
pumpkin
beer
interpretation
too
much
clutter
really
could
stand
a
lot
sharper
of
a
definition
nice
enough
to
drink
i
guess
but
i
just
dont
dig
the
spice
clogged
beers
not
my
preference
of
style
for
a
beer
but
it
works
this
beer
is
great
for
a
pumpkin
beer
note
that
its
also
my
fort
of
this
season
i
grew
to
loathe
the
style
but
this
i
a
nice
different
take
on
it
a
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
roasted
flavors
its
something
id
consider
picking
up
again
im
gonna
let
the
ther
can
age
for
a
bit
and
hope
that
theres
less
of
the
spice
so
i
can
enjoy
the
base
beer
for
what
it
is
a
beer
that
almost
demands
staunch
apologists
defensible
but
unremarkable
curious
but
still
blatantly
attuned
to
the
public
consciousness
and
as
such
something
that
might
very
possibly
become
remembered
for
being
better
than
it
was
what
im
saying
is
if
one
felt
compelled
to
compare
it
to
a
firm
point
in
the
sam
raimi
filmography
the
logical
conclusion
would
overwhelmingly
be
darkman
aside
from
the
herbal
character
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
nice
take
on
pumpkin
beer
fun
one
that
i
would
like
to
drink
again
dark

pumpkin
is

on

in

i

not

mmm
just
enough
to
leo
you
drinking
this

spice

the

feel

i
like
baltic
porters
and
this
is
ok
sadly
would
have
been
better
without
the
pumpkin
imo
the
taste
has
a
roasted
grain
flavor
with
subtle
dark
fruit
and
moderate
amount
of
spice
with
a
generally
cinnamon
dominant
warming
flavor
with
some
nutty
vegetal
taste
and
mild
light
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
interesting
and
worth
trying
i
like
the
concept
more
than
the
actual
beer
but
if
you
like
spiced
beers
or
strong
porters
it
is
more
enjoyable
than
most
i
like
this
its
a
very
nice
beer
from
21st
amendment
and
elysian
they
deliver
with
a
perfect
balance
between
chocolate
and
pumpkin
spices
recommended
overall
its
not
terrible
but
again
nothing
worth
getting
again
an
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
but
it
seems
every
time
i
try
a
dark
pumpkin
beer
i
am
disappointed
3
5
across
the
board
very
nice
and
complex
and
a
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
brew
that
begs
for
another
sip
reminds
me
of
monks
blood
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
a
fall
keeper
wow
this
beer
was
amazing
i
had
it
on
tap
for
the
first
time
and
was
blown
away
the
pumpkin
spice
and
the
porter
richness
mix
perfectly
together
this
beer
is
sold
in
4
packs
of
cans
two
cans
are
this
beer
and
the
other
two
are
a
belgium
style
ale
with
pumpkin
spice
both
are
phenomenal
and
if
you
are
into
pumpkin
beers
you
must
try
these
the
feel
is
even
and
smooth
in
a
medium
body
but
a
little
leaner
on
the
tongue
than
i
had
expected
it
has
a
light
crispness
to
it
as
well
i
had
this
at
101
beer
kitchen
this
is
an
excellent
blend
of
the
slightly
sweet
pumpkin
and
rich
silky
porter
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
giving
it
a
higher
score
is
the
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
however
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
d
this
one
is
certainly
more
baltic
porter
than
pumpkin
ale
similar
to
its
tripel
counterpart
the
pumpkin
plays
a
subdued
second
back
seat
this
is
still
a
respectable
but
unremarkable
offering
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
by
any
means
but
it
certainly
isnt
an
autumnal
seasonal
that
i
need
to
seek
out
each
year
odpretty
decent
not
sure
how
enamored
i
am
with
the
combo
of
porter
and
pumpkin
here
o
the
pumpkin
pie
flavors
are
not
quite
as
well
integrated
into
this
beer
as
the
he
said
tripel
however
this
is
a
really
delicious
porter
and
i
love
the
way
the
cinnamon
and
vanilla
flavors
blend
with
more
traditional
porter
characteristics
overall
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
with
this
coming
in
a
4
pack
and
2
of

2

of
the

ov
mediocre
effort
far
as
im
concerned
the
look
and
nose
were
solid
so
ive
no
idea
where
they
went
wrong
with
this
body
and
flavours
were
just
too
watery
for
me
and
really
let
me
down
here
their
he
said
tripel
was
very
good
so
i
dont
understand
how
they
got
this
one
wrong
i
think
they
should
scrap
this
one
and
just
brew
more
of
the
tripel
o
a
definitely
like
the
baltic
porter
much
more
than
the
tripel
in
this
four
pack
but
like
i
said
i
love
the
idea
of
two
completely
different
beers
in
a
single
four
pack
its
like
a
mini
sampler
love
it
pairs
well
with
a
spicy
indian
dish
im
pretty
sure
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
by
now
and
held
off
thinking
i
would
get
it
again
for
the
review
the
time
is
now
and
my
high
expectations
are
satisfied
by
the
great
balance
of
deep
chocolate
and
toasty
brown
things
a
flavorful
porter
thats
really
easy
to
drink
and
drink
and
drink
overall
really
smooth
and
it
has
a
nice
high
quality
chocolate
flavour
the
light
fruitiness
work
really
well
with
rest
of
the

a
great

i
should
have
bought
more

when
i
had
the
chance

i
really

noticeable
and
the
light
carbonation
combined
with
the
sweet

make
it
highly
drinkable
best
porter
ive
had
in
singapore
quite
an
enjoyable
porter
rich
and
dry
with
a
very
rounded
balanced
profile
that
is
so
silky
quite
a
bit
of
depth
but
also
very
tasty
upfront
with
pleasant
dchocolate
notes
it
is
big
but
it
is
not
heavy
as
in
a
big
imp
stout
worth
trying
quite
a
tasty
achievement
o
easy
to
drink
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
i
could
easily
have
another
one
of
these
and
enjoy
it
even
though
it
is
more
of
a
slow
sipper
od
potential
infection
for
this
bottle
as
something
seemed
a
bit
off
but
it
that
was
off
then
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
decent
flavours
and
well
executed

not

i

gives
it

feel
overall
feel
like
potential
is
there
and
maybe
something
happened
in
transport
to
cause
the
negative
attributes
of
the
beer
it
does
get
better
in
the
end
but
never
great
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite

in

in
the
nose
with
a
subtle
sweetness
along
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
taste
follows
suit
with
lots
of
sweet
roasty
malt
and
coffeeespresso
up
front
followed
by
hints
of
dark
chocolate
toffee
vanilla
and
just
a
touch
of
figs
and
licorice
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
and
a
real
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
overall
this
is
a
very
rich
and
drinkable
porter
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
yet
another
winner
from
nøgne
ø
after
the
first
taste
i
had
lots
of
chocolate
and
espresso
as
i
kept
drinking
the

im
glad
i
was
able

the
big
robust
flavours
something
i
would
gladly
revisit
final
grade
4

a
very
respectable
a
nøgne
øs
porter
is
considerably
more
creative
than
the
name
implies
at
7
im
more
inclined
to
consider
this
a
lighter
imperial
porter
than
a
true
english
porter
but
im
not
about
to
split
hairs
over
it
the
point
to
take
home
here
is
that
this
is
a
balanced
fairly
complex
dark
ale
with
a
delicious
bittersweet
flavour
profile
that
i
absolutely
loved
a
fabulous
brew
that
is
well
worth
sampling
and
a
great
way
to
strike
norway
from
my
aptlynamed
countries
to
sample
beer
from
list

d
a
very
tasty
porter
that
showcases
good
fruit
flavours
and
solid
herbal
qualities
and
one
i
would
pick
up
again
picks
right
up
where
the
imperial
stout
left
off
last
year
very
dependable
porter
highly
enjoyable
overall
a
very
nice
porter
good
stuff
when
i
give
it
good
quick
thought
it
tastes
like
an
extrachocolaty
sweeter
lessboozy
baltic
porter
straight
up
pretty
solid
nothing
remarkable
i
could
see
trying
this
again
though
o
i
knew
id
like
this
beer
ive
been
diggin
on
fullers
london
porter
and
also
a
fan
of
founders
porter
though
thats
not
an
english
porter
if
you
like
either
of
the
aforementioned
this
is
a
winner
of
course
theyre
all
porters
so
they
have
similar
profiles
but
none
of
them
taste
like
the
others
this
was
a
crisp
almost
american
black
aletasting
porter
but
sweeter
and
creamier
than
an
aba
very
nice
porter
but
if
they
labeled
it
as
a
stout
id
believe
them
a
fantastic
if
not
one
of
my
new
favorite
english
porters
o
i
was
blown
away
by
the
intricacies
of
the
flavors
in
this
porter
underrated
in
my
opinion
this
norwegian
brew
delivers
o
this
porter
goes
down
very
easily
but
has
enough
interesting
flavors
to
make
it
a
beer
that
you
can
sip
and
savor
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
highly
recommended
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
the
full
flavorarmoma
isnt
apparent
until
50
degrees
o
the
perfect
porter
very
traditional
and
very
tasty
if
you
like
porters
you
must
drink
this
still
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
even
though
this
is
an
excellent
archetypal
porter
its
a
tad
boringstraightforward
considering
the
price
i
might
not
have
again
o
this
is
a
fairly
mild
round
beer
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
zing
on
the
tongue
and
a
slightly
astringent
finish
if
it
were
anyone
elses
id
call
it
pretty
well
done
quality
and
no
complaints
compared
to
other
nogne
o
brews
however
it
does
not
deliver
the
same
sense
of
art
they
set
the
bar
pretty
high
so
i
guess
ill
have
to
give
this
a
lowly
very
good
o
very
good
porter
not
my
favorite
but
up
there
could
drink
this
all
the
time
very
pleasant
aftertaste
slightly
malty
and
slightly
less

less

than

creaminess
is
a
little
offputting
o
a
rich
complex
porter
that
is
highly
drinkable
for
its
7
abv
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
complex
but
smooth
as
it
goes
down
with
ease
and
has
a
silky
aftertaste
that
is
more
enjoyable
then
a
lot
of
porters
i
have
had
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
ones
a
very
dark
almost
midnight
beer
with
a
large
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
syrup
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
maple
the
first
sip
is
full
of
dark

roasted
malt
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
passes
quickly
had
it
at
the
good
life
in

overall
a
decent
porter
but
nothing
that
unique
or
unexpected
its
absolutely
not
a
bad
beer
actually
its
quite
nice
but
then
again
definitely
not
as
good
as
i
expected
especially
in
relation
to
the
wbc
silver
medal
in
the
robust
porter
category
theres
really
nothing
to
complain
about
here
its
a
very
nice
dark
roasty
robust
porter
we
get
nøgne

here
but
i
havent
seen
this
if
its
as
pricey
as
the
rest
its
going
to
be
disappointing
to
pass
on
this
more
times
than
not
due
to
price
on
the

noticeable
sediment
in
the
glass
roasty
malt
aroma
dark
chocolate
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
with
big
roastiness
malts
and
coffee
notes
dark
chocolate
and
tar
fullbodied
almost
stout
enough
to
be
a
stout
a
bit
heavy
but
still
a
quaffable
brew
o
i
find
myself
enjoying
this
more
than
i
expected
to
which
is
always
a
plus
i
went
into
this
with
little
to
no
expectation
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
this
again
yeah
theres
a
bit
of
a
foggy
haze
as
i
drink
this
quite
hot
for
a
porter
its
so
pleasant
and
balanced
though
so
i
just
dont
care
overall
a
very
nice
porter
too
expensive
to
buy
regularly
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
will
certainly
buy
it
again
at
some
point
mens
health
listed
this
one
as
a
top
25
beer
in
the
world
its
certainly
a
solid
representative
of
the
porter
style
with
an
unmistakable
chocolate
malt
presence
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
youd
want
to
have
on
hand
in
case
you
mention
dark
beer
to
someone
and
they
say
like
guinness
promptly
you
can
respond
well
like
this
pour
them
a
glass
they
will
thank
you
for
the
enlightenment
d
this
is
a
great
porter
and
is
so
easy
to
drink
hats
of
to
nognethis
is
good
o
nice
flavor
and
body
d
overall
pretty
meh
it
was
good
but
not
memorable
flavors
are
pretty
good
but
the
mouth
could
use
some
work
drinkabilty
what
a
pleasure
to
drink
easy
on
mouth
and
a
real
treat
to
drink
i
pounded
down
the
16
9
oz
bottle
and
loved
each
drink
im
very
impressed
with
this
brewery
so
far
any
porter
fan
needs
to
seek
this
out
taddy
porter
fans
and
even
oatmeal
stout
fans
really
should
try
this
if
it
was
56
id
probily
would
have
gave
it
a
5
on
drinkabilty
a
subtle
easytodrink
example
of
the
style
but
with
a
unique
twist
a
superb
porter
an
excellent
porter
and
a
true
flagship
for
this
outstanding
brewery
dangerously
drinkable
at
7
overall
overall
its
a
good
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
like
i
was
hoping
but
definitly
worth
a
try
taste
is
rich
and
delicious
with
lots
super
roasty
toasty
barley
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
flavors
that
come
out
even
more
when
it
warms
feel
is
super
smooth
and
silky
with
just
a
little
carbonation
super
drinakble
and
fresh
d
this
is
a
very
respectable
porter
and
i
recommend
it
a
mellow
soft
porter
very
impressed
with
this
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
highly
recommended
500ml

rich
roasted

a

dried

some

port

and
a

bitterness
as
the
beer
warms
the
fruit
and
port
flavours
give
off
a
slight
tartness
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
medium
creamy
and
oily
middle
prickly
carbonation
spicy
and
astringently
bitter
finish
with
a
chalky
cocoa
powder
aftertaste
exactly
what
i
want
from
a
porter
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
beer
is
much
thicker
and
more
robust
than
others
in
the
style
as
it
took
me
nearly
an
hour
to
finish
the
bottle
so
its
not
as
quaffable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
thats
a
minor
quip
this
is
still
a
marvellously
complex
and
warming
ale
that
i
plan
to
sip
on
frequently
as
the
cooler
fall
and
winter
months
approach
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
very
nice
flavors
to
it
and
it
was
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
the
chocolaty
flavors
were
particularly
nice
and
made
for
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
this
beer
came
with
its
mind
made
up
it
was
going
to
be
stout
and
substantial
focus
in
on
one
or
two
really
key
flavours
and
be
sure
to
keep
all
contributing
elements
in
check
you
gotta
love
its
resoluteness
theres
nothing
like
drinking
a
beer
that
is
undauntedly
flavourful
deliberately
brazen
and
exactingly
wellbuilt
to
and
through
this
is
fine
porter
served
on
tap
in
a
standard
pint
glass
at
tjs
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
mocha
head
which
dissaptes
completely
lacing
is
ample
and
lasting
nose
is
chocolate
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
sweeter
with
dark
chocolate
roasted
coffee
licorace
and
some
dark
fruits
hops
add
some
citrus
and
a
welcome
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
finish
is
a
little
sticky
but
not
unpleasantly
so
allinall
this
was
a
nice
offering
i
would
try
again
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
roasty
chewy
and
a
tad
boozy
eh
went
down
rather
well
would
give
a
second
shot
tasty
this
was
an
ok
porter
i
would
not
turn
one
down
however
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
taste
is
of
malt
cocoa
a
little
fresh
roasted
coffee
some
fruit
in
the
back
and
a
touch
of
caramel
ends
on
the
dry
side
drinkability
as
with
korean
cuisine
im
likin
it
but
im
just
not
lovin
it
still
id
say
give
it
a
try
as
most
everyone
else
seems
to
be
diggin
it
really
liked
this
one
would
buy
again
im
still
unclear
of
the
line
between
porter
and
stout
this
seems
to
push
the
boundry
id
like
to
see
a
little
less
sweet
have
to
say
im
slightly
let
down
by
this
its
decent
but
if
i
want
a
porter
edmund
fitzgerald
is
still
my
go
to
glad
i
tried
this
one
though
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
smoke
in
there
mild
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
finishes
with
some
coffee
and
a
minimal
chocolate
bitterness
overall
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
smooth
ive
passed
on
this
brew
a
number
of
times
so
i
figured
while
i
was
at
ck
i
might
as
well
finally
try
this
guy
out
he
pours
an
opaque
black
brown
headed
by
a
finger
of
dark
khaki
foam
the
smell
comprises
dark
roasted
malts
coffee
vodka
spruce
and
pine
its
as
though
a
thicker
version
of
a
baltic
porter
was
roasted
a
bit
more
than
normal
the
taste
is
identical
though
just
to
be
different
those
crazy
norwegian
liquids
a
firm
touch
of
bitterness
is
added
its
interesting
ill
give
em
that
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
sticky
feel
overall
a
solid
porter
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
maybe
after
all
of
the
passes
id
built
it
up
a
bit
mentally
but
either
way
im
not
all
that
impressed
though
my
thirst
has
indeed
been
slaked
d
would
be
great
with
a
meal
as
the
flavor
is
good
yet
mild
enough
to
not
overpower
the
flavor
of
the
food
the
mildness
make
it
not
worth
drinking
alone
though
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
color
with
firm
cap
of
khaki
head
leaving
decent
lacing
scent
if
of
molasses
charred
grain
roasted
nuts
and
some
earthy
qualities
taste
brings
a
moderate
amount
of
molasses
along
with
toffee
and
roasted
nuts
hints
of
chocolate
and
medium
roast
coffee
and
hints
of
cherry
the
background
is
a
nice
fresh
grain
profile
found
in
many
of
nognes
beers
interesting
floral
hoppy
profile
dances
around
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
a
touch
high
level
of
carbonation
a
good
porter
with
a
lot
of
freshness
to
it
pretty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
get
it
again
d
for
a
7
porter
id
say
it
has
good
drinkability
tastes
great
feels
good
on
the
tongue
the
appearance
and
the
smell
are
the
only
things
that
bring
this
down
id
drink
it
again
if
we
had
it
in
tx
this
is
very
drinkable
would
have
been
rated
higher
if
not
for
the
sour
smell
as
is
this
rocketed
to
the
top
of
my
porter
list
d
moderately
high
a
very
tasty
beer
the
price
and
availability
may
limit
how
often
i
revisit
this
one
but
i
saw
this
on
sale
for
8
when
it
had
been
10
so
i
bought
it
despite
the
fact
that
it
still
was
a
pretty
bad
deal
for
a
500ml
bottle
of
porter
it
was
black
of
course
and
smelled
a
little
roasty
but
also
a
tinge
of
metallic
so
i
knocked
the
score
down
the
taste
was
nice
sweet
roasty
pretty
good
i
will
of
course
never
buy
a
second
bottle
because
it
is
just
to
expensive
but
this
was
a
pretty
good
american
porter
with
a
robust
flavor
pretty
much
dead
on
for
my
mental
picture
of
a
strong
porter
great
chalky
roast
character
that
for
me
is
the
signature
of
the
style
dark
bitter
chocolate
combines
with
bready
malt
light
caramel
and
mild
english
yeast
relatively
big
bitter
citric
hops
push
through
despite
the
relatively
low
ibu
count
and
at
least
four
or
five
months
of
age
on
the
bottle
theres
a
licorice
flavor
in
there
too
no
idea
what
thats
from
dry
flavor
the
beer
looks
great
its
black
with
a
big
head
creamy
and
light
brown
mouthfeel
could
be
a
touch
fuller
but
its
quite
good
excellent
porter
with
great
bitterness
mediumbodied
medium
effervescence
and
medium
dryness
somewhat
tingly
on
the
tongue
pretty
good
interesting
idea
for
a
scandinavian
brewery
to
emulate
an
american
style
instead
of
the
reverse
while
the
abv
clocks
in
at
7
which
in
my
experience
is
on
the
higher
end
of
the
spectrum
for
a
porter
i
did
not
experience
any
noticeable
taste
of
alcohol
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
waiting
for
the
weather
to
warm
in
norway
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
porter

pretty

brew
for

slightly
on

i
scored
the

for

and
thinks
its
fairly
priced
at
that
i
was
quickly
tiring
of
my
500ml
bottle
d
nice
example
of
the
style
but
the
winter
porter
is
much
better
nøgne
ø
porter
is
a
dim
dark
brown
ale
with
a
thin
dense
beige
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
on
the
glass
it
smells
dark
and
complex
with
a
lot
of
roasty
coffee
its
medium
bodied
smooth
and
clean
in
the
mouth
its
not
sweet
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
roasty
like
coffee
there
are
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
cassis
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
a
baltic
porter
but
this
is
more
bitter
and
complex
this
is
a
delicious
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
porter
to
drink
for
a
long
time
the
7
0abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
this
glass
this
would
be
a
great
session
porter
too
bad
its
not
available
to
me
locally
overall
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
when
i
first
smelled
the
beer
but
once
i
tasted
it
i
was
thoroughly
whelmed
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
nothing
really
blows
me
away
about
this
beer
but
i
do
respect
nogne
o
and
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
was
better
fresh
in
europe
i
appreciate
the
bottle
conditioning
homebrew
feel
it
has
it
pours
a
dark
opaque
sable
with
a
very
thick
if
not
too
persistent
light
brown
head
the
bottle
i
got
foamed
like
nobodys
business
so
be
careful
if
you
have
this
in
a
bottle
aroma
is
rich
smoky
mochalike
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
very
inviting
flavor
is
like
fine
roast
coffee
with
chocolate
undertones
but
it
got
a
bit
tinny
as
i
got
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
satisfying
this
beer
pours
black
in
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
has
a
brownish
beige
color
to
it
grainy
nose
of
wheat
and
raw
barley
the
attack
reveals
some
grainy
hints
as
well
it
is
very
different
for
a
porter
and
i
must
admit
i
find
the
grain
heavy
character
to
be
a
bit
out
of
place
for
the
style
there
is
a
decent
malt
presence
very
little
hops
presenting
itself
openly
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
really
the
only
part
of
the
flavor
that
is
speaking
to
me
is
the
rawness
of
the
grain
flavor
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
just
dont
really
know
what
to
think
about
a
porter
that
lacks
the
characteristics
i
am
accustomed
to
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
about
the
finish
it
has
a
light
body
about
it
i
am
appreciative
that
my
wife
brought
this
back
for
us
to
enjoy
thankfully
she
thinks
its
wonderful
for
me
its
just
okay
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
smooth
with
a
very
decent
drinkability
hindered
only
by
by
its
flavor
j
this
beer
pours
a
jet
blackbrown
colour
that
lets
no
light
thru
at
all
it
is
averagely
carbonated
and
leaves
a
nice
half
finger
cappicino
laced
head
that
dissapears
as
fast
as
it
appears
to
leave
a
nice
semi

the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
indeed
i
really
like
it
just
right
for
this
stylethis
is
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
ive
reviewed
so
far
and
will
make
sure
this
beer
stays
in
my
collection
in
future
d
with
the
heavy
bodymouthful
i
could
prob
only
drink
one
bomber
of
this
this
it
a
beer
thats
good
for
drinking
with
a
nice
burger
or
steak
and
savor
the
roasty
complexity
of
the
beer
smooth
full
mouthfeel
and
an
easy
drinkability
given
a
nice
moderate
body
surely
worth
a
try

a
very
enjoyable

the

pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
earthy
black
malt
scent
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
dry
roasted
character
with
loads
of
black
malt
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
finish
but
its
primarily
a
dry
coffee
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
good
porter
but
nothing
im
too
excited
about
this
beer

toffee
upfront
leading
in
to

this

from
the

it
goes
down
very
easily

what

a
lot
got
lost
along
the
way
if
the
flavor
of
this
beer
matched
the
setup
this
would
be
an
outstanding
porter
unfortunately
it
doesnt
so
it
simply
rates
an
above
average
a
strikingly
clean
and
well
attenuated
porter
with
lowlying
sweetness
and
ultimate
maltiness
malts
show
a
great
malty
bready
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
heavy
focus
on
the
roasted
malts
that
nearly
shove
the
beer
into
stout
proportions
the
opaque
dark
brown
beer
holds
a
fantastic
head
and
laces
very
well
as
the
beer
fades
deep
french
roast
coffee
flavor
is
mixed
with
light
campfirelike
notes
and
really
make
the
beer
taste
like
stouts
even
down
to
the
dry
and
ashy
texture
hop
aromas
give
a
nice
fresh
pine
aroma
taste
while
supplying
a
firm
bitterness
without
the
thread
of
any
rising
sweetness
quite
dry
and
clean
throughout
this
porter
definately
takes
an
americanized
twist
on
things
and
definately
does
not
show
the
milk
chocolate
or
caramel
sweetness
that
is
usually
found
in
english
style
porters
d
this
one
im
rating
against
the
style
as
opposed
to
pure
personal
opinion
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
porter
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
serving
type
bottle
d
very
drinkable
i
love
dark
beers
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
me
d
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
combining
it
with
a
piece
or
two
of
dark
chocolate
makes
it
even
more
delightful
chocolate
is
truly
a
perfect
companion
to
this
one
but
make
sure
a
quality
beer
is
accompanied
by
some
dark
quality
chocolate
d
drinkability
is
right
up
their
with
the
best
what
i
really
love
is
the
strong
malty
profile
and
explosive
flavors
that
drench
the
tongue
incredible
showing
for
a
porter
how
do
they
pack
so
much
flavor
in
a
slim
bottle
poured
a
very
dark
brown
slight
frothy
head
incredible
amount
of
chocolate
and
a
good
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
this
isnt
an
over
the
top
porter
but
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
enjoyed
every
ounce
of
it
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
fizzy
for
the
style
flavor
mimics
the
nose
except
for
a
lingering
coffee
roastiness
there
isnt
a
lot
of
depth
and
really
lacks
the
creaminess
of
the
elite
porters
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
fairly
smooth
which
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
though
it
came
in
a
larger
bottle
i
didnt
find
it
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
nice
roasted
characteristics
come
through
in
the
flavor
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
flavor
on
this
one
there
was
a
tangy
sourlike
note
in
the
finish
that
was
a
little
disappointing
could
taste
some
of
the
dark
fruits
in
there
as
well
but
overall
just
fell
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
whatever
those
are
not
that
bad
but
not
the
greatest
still
i
recommend
you
try
it
for
yourself
one
finger
head
comprised
of
bubbles
so
large
you
think
you
hear
them
popping
cream
brown
in
color
below
theres
a
slight
brown
touch
to
the
basically
black
hued
liquid
smells
like
a
chocolate
cake
with
chocolate
icing
while
served
with
hot
chocolate
lots
of
say
chocolate
toffee
ice
cream
scents
follow
that
along
with
dates
plums
cooked
oatmeal
overall
more
slow
roasted
than
toasty
or
smoky
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
great
deal
of
density
yet
still
comes
across
as
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
vibrates
through
the
liquid
to
prevent
full
congealing
the
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
here
matched
more
evenly
by
espresso
bean
toffee
and
general
maltiness
theres
a
nice
mineral
or
spring
water
freshness
below
which
evokes
something
like
lemon
peel
or
forest
pine
constructed
in
a
subtle
style
which
mandates
a
good
deal
of
concentration
to
catch
the
nuances
nothing
obvious
here
ok
maybe
the
chocolate
very
clean
finish
resets
the
palate
for
the
next
sip
drinkability
that
word
is
an
understatement
with
the
brew
just
an
excellent
porter
porter
fans
should
really
enjoy
this
dark
liquid
jewel
from
norway
very
delicious
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
offering
from
nogne
it
was
one
of
the
best
porters
that
ive
tasted
i
will
continue
to
buy
this
one
highly
recommended
this
was
an
outstanding
porter
that
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
this
good
at
all
a
perfect
blending
of
flavors
this
is
my
new
standard
despite
the
high
price
tag
of
their
beers
i
will
pick
one
up
if
i
see
it
around
highly
recommended
dark
brown
pour
with
a
solid
tan
head
arising
roasty
and
earthy
in
scent
and
flavor
just
a
hint
of
mocha
great
in
the
mouth
and
smooth
going
down
lingers
nicely
a
bit
but
clean
side
note
scandanavian
porters
are
the
best
close
second
english
then
us
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
shortlived
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
licorice
earthy
yeast
roasted
malt
chocolate
smoke
and
toast
in
the
nose
taste
is
bittersweet
chocolate
burnt
coffee
leather
dates
and
a
mix
of
toffee
caramel
hops
and
cream
some
of
that
soy
taste
as
well
kind
of
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
strong
but
not
in
an
abv
sense
just
flavorful
with
strong
roasted
but
not
charred
malts
coffee
mocha
cherry
chocolate
raspberry
and
maybe
some
other
heavy
fruits
the
beer
is
extremely
creamy
very
smooth
and
a
nice
after
dinner
accompaniment
the
beer
has
at
least
five
different
malts
that
add
layers
of
complexity
to
the
taste
and
just
enough
hop
presence
to
make
the
beer
come
to
life
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
modest
carbonation
is
quite
low
but
not
flat
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
good
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
underneath
this
is
a
delightful
beer
worth
venturing
for
lchaim
d
this
is
a
drinkable
and
interesting
beer
despite
some
odd
traits
with
the
taste
worth
a
look
a
good
porter
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
would
recommend
and
drink
this
again

great
roasted
quality
a
bit
of
sour
like
a
baltic
but
not
enough
to
even
put
that
in
the
forefront
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again

another

strangely
enough
the
norwegians
have
made
a
porter
that
should
be
a

good

this

occasional

for
awhile

left
a

some

so
are

roasted

i
could
have
again

high
d
this
is
a
well

beer
that
is

is
a

beer
for
a
porter
in

not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
i
usually
like
my
darker
beers
to
be
lightlyhopped
but
this
might
be
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
my
first
beer
from
nøgne

and
its
a
winner
i
will
be
trying
more
from
their
line
of
beers
for
sure
getting
through
a

of
this

a
pleasure
i
could
see
this

bottle
served
at
monks
if
i
had
to
sum
up
this
beer
in
4
words
it
would
be
porter
brewed
with
hops
appearance
wise
it
looks
like
a
standard
good
porter
nice
deep
brown
with
a
tan
head
nice
dark
fruit
and
coffee
aromas
but
the
taste
has
a
fairly
strong
flavor
of
the
sort
of
hops
youd
normally
only
see
in
a
decent
ipa
nice
creamy
smooth
mouthful
besides
that
but
it
really
enjoy
it
you
would
have
to
be
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
of
flavors
and
nicely
presented
one
of
these
bottles
is
enough
in
a
night
but
i
will
be
seeking
this
brew
out
in
the
future
the
abv
is
high
enough
to
not
make
this
sessionable
for
myself
pours
black
with
an
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
okay
lacing
and
sticks
around
as
a
thin
ring
nice
roasty
aromas
not
too
strong
and
a
good
bit
of
dark
fruit
here
as
well
aubtle
slightly
rich
and
fairly
dry
the
same
thing
is
going
on
with
the
taste
smooth
balanced
some
dark

nice
roast
flavors
and
a
good
hit
of
dry
european
style
licorice
delicious
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
quite
dry

this
easy
to
keep
drinking

theres

very

the

abv
isnt
noticable
at
all
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
in
a
while
its
a
very
good
all
around
brew
id
definitely
recommend
this
to
others
and
also
buy
it
again
the
next
time
i
find
it
damn
drinkable
porter
very
tasty
without
being
overpowering
or
impossible
to
take
longs
sips
from
awesome
take
on
an
american
style
from
norway
i
appreciate
that
they
list
the
ingredients
combined
with
the
nordic
water
they
have
made
an
outstanding
example
of
a
porter
the
nose
on
the
beer
has
a
chocolate
hint
with
slight
bits
of
spices
the
beer
is
quite
thick
and
less
carbonated
than
i
expected
the
bitterness
from
the
beer
is
from
the
coffee
flavours
with
a
small
bit
of
hops
there
is
a
nice
subtle
taste
of
chocolate
that
comes
to
the
pallet
towards
the
beginning
of
the
drink
the
beer
also
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
which
i
cant
figure
out
what
it
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
as
well
and
id
definitely
get
this
again
a
good
scorer
on
the
nite
but
fairly
different
from
all
other
brews
a
solid
porter
but
not
my
favorite
d
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
turn
this
beer
down
again
very
impressed

this
porter

balanced
by
a
slight
bitter
of
hops
cocoa
throughout
it
all
and
this
is
a
true
porter
the
surprise
is
the
amount
of
hops
on
the
finish
really
puts
a
fresh
touch
to
the
dark
style
of
a
porter
i
like
it

that
is

rare

have
a
few
more
from
nogne
glad
to
see
a
very
good
one
from
the
get
go
poured
into
a
tulip
this
was
a

this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
as
robust
as
i
thought
it
would
be
still
would
drink
it
again
final
note
well
worth
the
price
of
admission

roasty

is
exceptional
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
somehow
dry
cocoa
flavor
balanced
perfectly
with
bittersweet
dark
roast
finishes
so
smoothly
and
cleanly
leaving
a
hint
of
a
pleasant
aftertaste
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
makes
for
a
silky
creamy
beer
one
of
the
favorite
beers
ever

nearlyblack
opaque

with
two
fingers
of
very
rich
brown
head
and
generous
lace
smells
of
sweetened
cocoa
caramel
malts
and
grain
perhaps
a
touch
of
oatmeal
in
there
somewhere
the
flavor
starts
with
sweet
chocolate
malt
builds
to
a
rounded
toasty
center
and
finishes
with
lactic
and
faintly
smoky
notes
somewhat
high
in
alcohol
for
a
porter
though
it
cant
be
easily
discerned
in
the

little
unassuming

note
special
thanks
to
beerhandy
for
sharing
this
bottle
taste
is
heavy
roasted
but
does
not
turn
sharp
or
extremely
maltbitter
it
is
just
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
with
the
big
bosy
there
to
balance
things
out
there
is
molasses
and
coffee
a
nice
fruity
yeast
that
appears
to
be
somewhat
english
the
beer
is
bitter
and
has
some
maltbitter
which
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
body
i
dont
know
how
they
did
it
but
it
has
a
bog
body
but
it
is
not
sweet
or
sticky
neither
is
the
beer
dry
just
perfect
d
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
in
a
long
time
fantastic
balance
and
its
so
flavorful
not
much
to
complain
about
here
except
that
it
can
be
pretty
thick
at
times
a
must
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
to
medium
bodied
actually
feels
a
little
thin
but
its
not
a
negative
its
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
carbonation
is
somewhat
low
but
great
for
this
beer
overall
this
is
very
very
good
porter
perfect
pairing
with
a
chocolate
cake
d
drinks
well
i
will
probably
buy
again
d
very
drinkable
it
is
a
little
strong
but
still
a
brew
i
would
like
to
quaff
through
the
course
of
an
evening
almost
opaque
some
light
is
getting
through
the
edges
of
this
dark
brown
sample
a
nice
dark
tan
head
that
is
slightly
thicker
than
that
of
a
rootbeer
float
settles
quickly
to
spotty
lacing
patterns
the
smell
is
a
rich
aggressive
dark
chocolate
toasted
malt
and
coffee
bean
that
is
very
similar
to
the
flavor
you
can
almost
taste
it
before
it
gets
into
your
mouth
a
mellow
tingle
of
carbonation
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
full
flavored
the
roasted
mocha
taste
lingers
nicely
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
contributes
a
dry
sense
to
the
finish
a
real
nice
drinker
the
7
abv
is
warming

nicely
integrated
recommended
pours
pitch
black
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
nose
has
noticeable
cocoa
powder
tones
and
coffee
notes
as
well
flavor
is
more
along
the
roasted
edge
as
it
warms
up
there
seems
to
be
a
sweet
edge
that
borders
on
being
berry
influenced
almost
stays
nice
and
rounded
and
a
good
aftertaste
is
left
to
linger
feel
is
smooth
carbonation
is
higher
drinkable
yes
i
like
d
great
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
sipping
beer
not
a
session
beer
but
it
is
quite
a
joy
to
sip
the
complexity
is
fantastic
and
it
has
more
than
enough
depth
to
keep
you
interested
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
stands
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
american
imperial
stouts
and
porters
such
as
those
from
stone
and
victory
i
had
seen
nogne
o
at
beers
in
stores
several
times
without
stopping
to
pick
one
up
but
after
this
i
will
certainly
not
pass
them
by
any
longer
very
very
drinkable
for
such
a
flavorful
porter
the
drinkability
is
good
really
a
nice
job
on
a
big
porter
almost
drinks
like
a
stout
prosit
mk
d
it
is
a
pretty
good
porter
i
think
i
preferred
their
winter
ale
but
still
a
good
beer
served
at
cellar
temp
a
fantastic
plain
old
porter
nothing
fancy
about
it
just
a
good
old
porter
super
dark
mahogany
in
colour
with
a
light
brown
perfectly
sticky
head
the
smell
isnt
anything
spectacular
but
the
taste
is
all
that
a
porter
should
be
and
nothing
it
shouldnt
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
flavours
thick
but
not
too
thick
and
drinks
very
easy
i
highly
recomend
this
to
anyone
who
loves
a
good
porter
this
porter
pours
tar
black
with
little
head
incorporates
all
the
taste
of
a
porter
but
not
overpowering
like
many
can
be
its
a
very
smooth
porter
borderline
watery
but
for
me
just
right
often
times
i
am
turned
of
by
the
sharp
maltiness
of
many
porters
so
i
enjoy
this
one
very
much
good
buy
but
a
bit
expensive
in
america
at
about
9
bucks
a
bottle
pours
jet
black
with
a
big
tannishbrown
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
roasty
malt
in
the
taste
quite
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
a
nice
malty
body
with
a
small
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
chocolate
malt
aftertaste
very
nice
porter
nice
chocolate
malt
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
m
i
was
surprised
by
how
thin
almost
flat
this
beer
tasted
it
wasnt
thin
in
a
negative
sense
but
didnt
match
up
with
what
i
expected
from
the
scent
pours
an
opaque
dark
brownred
highlights
thin
off
white
head
leaves
some
lace
spots
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
dates
toffee
chocolate
some
light
roast
touch
of
floral
quite
nice
taste
is
very
roasty
rich
chocolate
cherries
bit
of
beef
jerky
smoke
powdered
milk
weird
fruitiness
kind
of
cloying
flavour
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
smooth
sticky
something
about
this
beer
i
dont
get
i
enjoy
the
aroma
a
lot
and
the
flavour
as
well
but
there
are
a
couple
that
were
off
but
my
mouth
felt
kind
of
dirty
after
drinking
it
pretty
strange
ill
try
this
again
but
im
kind
of
on
the
fence
at
this
point
recommended
only
if
you
are
willing
to
pay
this
much
for
a
bottle
but
nothing
spectacular
just
an
average
beer
the
only
cool
thing
is
that
it
is
norweigan
this
ones
a
gusher
pours
out
nearly
black
with
some
ruby
edges
head
is
thinnish
but
of
an
attractive
frothy
tan
composition
smells
like
a
mix
of
dark
roast
black
coffee
and
dark
hot
chocolate
some
undertones
of
molasses
tobacco
and
a
shy
citrus
hop
character
roasty
coffee
is
at
the
fore
of
the
taste
profile
cocoa
powder
lingers
just
beneath
it
citrus
and
raisin
comes
out
more
towards
the
middle
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
astringency
and
some
lactic
sourness
roasted
grain
lingers
on
into
the
aftertaste
along
with
the
citrus
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
which
is
just
fine
here
with
the
amount
of
sweetness
in
the
beer
solid
drinkability
very
impressed
d
well
balanced
and
tasty
a
tad
thin
in
the
body
nitpicking
there
im
guessing
low
56
alcohol
it
slides
down
quickly
and
smoothly
overall
an
outstanding
porter
probably
the
best
ive
tried
so
far
highly
recommended
my
first
offering
from
nogne
and
will
not
be
my
last
good
solid
porter
with
spot
on
flavors
and
aromas
great
mouthfeel
drank
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
im
very
impressed
with
this
porter
overall
very
good
drinkability
though
its
a
little
stout
for
the
style
regardless
i
think
i
found
a
new
favorite
this
one
is
as
close
to
perfection
as
ive
had
for
a
porter
somebody
send
me
their
imperial
stouts
d
a
very
good
porter
w
hints
at
baltic
porter
style
but
plenty
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
a
solid
choice
a
very
good
norwegian
porter
as
good
or
better
than
many
american
porters
been
sitting
for
a
week
since
i
bought
it
and
the
carbonation
flowed
out
fast
so
watch
out
the
smell
is
wonderful
sooo
great
it
smells
fruity
with
great
chocolate
tones
in
the
background
the
head
was
great
but
then
fell
fast
leaving
behind
a
lilypad
effect
with
a
good
thick
lacing
the
color
is
black
with
seemingly
less
than
a
millimeter
of
light
that
comes
through
in
a
purpleish
color
the
smell
is
slightly
roasty
with
good
chocolate
flavors
backed
up
by
good
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
very
fruity
and
has
a
burst
of
light
fruity
flavor
that
mellows
and
then
has
an
aftertaste
like
a
great
coffee
with
a
nose
of
the
same
smooth
roasty
coffee
flavors
you
find
in
an
expensive
coffee
light
mouthfeel
that
is
very
smooth
especially
for
such
a
large
carbonation
reaction
when
opened
its
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
then
dissapears
without
a
trace
so
maybe
a
little
dry
without
any
harshness
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
will
have
another
one
while
to
finish
definitely
not
a
session
beer
recommended
overall
a
decent
porter
but
a
bit
onedimensional
no
problems
consuming
the
bottle
and
would
probably
drink
another
if
i
had
one
the
body
is
fairly
thin
medium
at
most
carbonation
is
light
with
a
creamy
feel
a
good
balance
between
sweet
and
dry
very
good
and
very
drinkable
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
imperial
stout
if
this
is
their
idea
of
a
standard
porter
d
not
bad
i
will
seek
out
other
nogne
beers
but
not
the
porter
in
particular
this
bottle
of
nøgne
ø
porter
was
picked
up
during
my
last
visit
to
greens
when
uncapped
the
beer
formed
a
rapidly
rising
head
in
the
bottle
but
the
quickness
of
my
hands
avoided
any
spillage
in
my
imperial
pint
glass
this
formed
a
four
finger
tall
beige
head
which
looked
in
stark
contrast
to
the
deep
black
color
of
the
body
the
hefty
roastiness
of
the
aroma
indicated
that
this
was
going
to
be
forceful
porter
the
kind
of
drink
the
vikings
would
have
enjoyed
before
going
on
a
berserk
raid
in
an
alternate
brewing
universe
coffee
and
chocolate
were
everywhere
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
sharp
yet
soft
as
the
astringent
taste
and
silky
body
rubbed
shoulders
in
the
same
glass
i
did
not
get
much
of
the
dried
fruit
flavors
that
were
mentioned
on
the
back
label
but
coffee
and
toffee
were
definitely
abundant
slight
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
hint
of
bitter
cocoa
lingered
on
some
brashness
in
the
mouthfeel
from
the
roast
grain
but
it
was
right
at
home
in
the
style
well
done
imported
porter
which
is
not
the
typical
case
its
a
pretty
good
porter
but
it
just
seems
like
theres
no
imagination
the
taste
is
of
roasted
chocolate
plain
clean
good
but
not
that
impressive
theres
a
nice
aroma
to
match
and
it
certainly
wasnt
bland
there
was
just
no
zing
for
the
price
i
want
something
to
savor
ill
stick
to
sierra
nevada
and
anchor
porter
recommended
a
nicely
done
porter
indeed
maybe
a
touch
pricey
for
everyday
drinking
of
course
life
is
short
right
overall
its
a
decent
porter
but
has
some
off
notes
i
purchased
a
bottle
of
this
somewhat
randomly
without
any
prior
knowledge
of
the
brewery
or
the
brew
itself
having
no
real
expectations
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
of
this
beer
it
poured
jet
black
as
youd
expect
from
a
porter
of
this
strength
with
a
fairly
minimal
crown
of
beige
foam
on
top
the
head
doesnt
last
long
and
eventually
settles
into
a
small
ring
around
the
edges
i
found
the
somewhat
subdued
carbonation
ideal
for
the
style
it
lends
an
easy
drinkability
and
smooth
mouthfeel
the
nose
and
flavor
are
maltheavy
roasted
and
chocolatey
mild
but
delicious
the
taste
surprised
me
somewhat
at
7
abv
i
was
expecting
a
heavy
porter
something
closer
to
a
strong
stout
despite
its
strength
the
beer
stays
true
to
the
modern
porter
style
with
a
pleasantly
mellow
character
mediumtothin
body
overall
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
its
a
shame
this
isnt
more
widely
available
good
smell
full
of
malt
and
nut
notes
with
a
good
taste
that
is
good
for
the
style
balance
with
nothing
overbearing
this
porter
is
approachable
to
my
favorite
which
is
barley
johns
old
8
the
only
draw
back
to
this
beer
and
why
its
not
a
full
time
member
of
my
fridge
is
the
fact
that
its
just
a
touch
pricey
for
a
porter
when
i
can
go
down
the
road
for
only
3
25
and
get
old
8
pricey
and
maybe
not
deservingly
so
6
99bomber
in
these
here
parts
a
good
porter
but
hard
to
really
set
it
apart
from
a
large
swath
of
porters
out
there
if
it
were
my
local
id
certainly
buy
it
frequently
but
i
have
no
plans
on
relocating
to
norway
yet
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
body
with
a
nice
mahogany
color
around
the
edges
very
little
head
to
speak
of
but
what
was
there
dissipates
very
quickly
down
to
nothing
with
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
toasted
chocolate
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
in
the
end
this
medium
to
thin
body
porter
is
well
carbonated
and
roll
around
the
tongue
perfectly
this
porter
tastes
of
bitter
roasted
coffee
kinda
charcoal
and
smokey
too
it
finishes
with
chalky
dry
chocolate
and
leaves
a
slight
roasted
bitter
flavor
on
the
tongue
very
good
porter
thats
very
drinkable
and
for
5
its
not
a
bad
buy
either
at
7
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
which
is
my
only
real
complaint
about
this
beer
and
theres
a
bit
of
warming
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
drinkabiliity
is
very
good
as
well
pours
a
threefinger
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
black
as
midnight
slight
hoppy
nose
light
carbonation
and
heavy

with
a

finish

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
a
very
dark
black
beer
with
only
the
vaguest
hints
of
mahogony
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
very
creamy
dark
beige
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
has
hint
of
spice
and
licorice
with
a
roast
malt
backbone
there
was
a
good
porter
mouth
feel
oddly
all
of
the
flavor
seems
to
land
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
all
of
the
roast
malt
notes
fighting
with
the
bitter
sweet
chocolate
character
and
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
yet
still
the
body
is
fairly
light
it
has
a
medium
heft
to
it
as
it
rests
on
the
palate
it
does
not
have
the
heft
or
rich
feeling
that
i
might
have
been
expecting
from
the
aroma
dusty
chocolate
flavors
are
noticeable
up
front
and
the
finish
has
a
distinct
espresso
character
of
burnt
acidity
and
a
suite
of
roast
coffee
bean
flavors
the
beer
dries
out
considerably
after
the
first
few
sips
and
it
is
not
quite
as
rich
as
i
was
hoping
still
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
tipple
one
which
i
am
quite
content
to
finish
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
not
great
ive
been
disappointed
with
nogne
beers
so
far
the
second
to
last
nogne
we
sampled
the
other
night
this
one
was
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
the
body
was
a
deep
black
hole
with
a
small
tan
head
that
lingered
for
a
bit
the
been
gave
off
a
malty
slightly
bitter
bouquet
that
was
music
to
my
nose
the
taste
was
a
nice
solid
porter
roasted
malt
coffee
cocoa
all
mixing
together
to
made
a
full
bodied
brew
that
is
worth
another
try
terrible
substantial
stuff
with
an
intriquing
kick
this
is
a
great
americanstyle
porter
from
a
country
not
associated
with
beer
it
is
on
par
with
sierra
nevada
porter
seems
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
slightly
thin
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
high
in
carbonation
for
a
porter
but
i
like
it
adds
a
nice
creamy
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
roasty
burnt
caramel
flavors
with
a
pot
of
stale
coffee
on
the
end
finish
is
lingering
and
dry
again
very
roasty
not
overly
complex
but
very
balanced
and
palatable

with
some
subdued

chocolate
with
an
overall

it

well
extemely
bold

some
great
black
currant
and
burnt

flavors
malty
sweetness
behind
it
all
with
just
a
trace
of
bitterness
the
most
chocolate
flavor
i
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
that
doesnt
claim
to
be
a
chocolate
beer
great
bodythe
sweetness
is
very
prominant
though
it
has
an
evenly
dry
finish
just
a
super
beer
i
wish
more
us
porters
had
the
overall
balls
that
this
does
along
the
borderlines
of
a
stout
to
me
great
beer
bring
on
the
imperial
stout
i
say
i
am
very
very
impressed
recommended
to
dark
beer
fans
this
one
brings
it
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
brown
dark
tan
head
of
about
half
a
finger
sticks
around
a
bit
before
receding
to
a
thin
film
lacing
is
kind
of
thick
in
falling
sheets
that
dont
stick
aroma
is
of
dark
bittersweet
chocolates
some
ground
coffee
not
all
too
complex
but
satisfying
the
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
bittersweet
chocolates
and
more
coffee
a
good
bittering
pretty
sound
porter
feel
to
it
the
mouth
is
probably
the
best
parth
though
incredible
smoothness
medium
body
feels
right
and
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
very
dark
with
deep
ruby
highlights
the
short
cap
of
light
brown
foam
produced
plenty
of
streaky
lacing
even
after
falling
to
a
thin
skim
of
bubbles
nice
aroma
some
roast
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
with
just
a
hint
of
burnt
malt
and
smoke
mild
yet
solid
bitterness
with
leafy
hops
running
straight
through
the
middle
malt
sweetness
was
mostly
the
chocolate
variety
with
a
little
caramel
filling
out
the
end
dark
malts
were
more
prominent
in
the
finish
just
a
little
burnt
and
roast
charaacter
lowish
carbonation
with
a
mediumfull
body
fine
texture
and
just
a
little
dry
tasty
stuff
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
nicely
balanced
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
i
expected
good
things
from
this
beer
but
i
had
no
idea
it
was
going
to
be
this
good
i
should
have
gotten
a
case
when
i
had
the
opportunity
nogne
porter
is
an
outstanding
offering
that
i
urge
anyone
and
everyone
to
try
tasting
is
believing
its
one
of
the
best
american
porters
that
ive
ever
had
and
its
brewed
in
norway
what
are
the
odds
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
tight
14
dark
brown
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
quickly
is
down
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
with
slowfalling
orangetinged
brown
lace
aroma
is
rich
chocolate
dark
fuirt
and
some
alcohol
taste
mirrors
the
nose
almost
exactly
with
the
aftertaste
an
amalgam
of
all
of
the
above
and
also
a
bit
of
roastiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
deceptively
thin
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
bottle
doesnt
say
so
but
if
any
beer
is
an
imperial
porter
this
is
it
drinkability
is
great
very
well
balanced
and
quite
tasty
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
and
in
near
perfect
harmony
with
the
malt
and
bitterness
a
great
porter
this
is
a
very
inviting
beer
that
seems
to
age
with
great
dignity
beer
is
good
happy
beering
edit
ended
up
dumping
this
down
the
drain
wasnt
even
willing
to
finish
it
off
bleh
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
porter
with
a
big
slightly
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
chocolate
malt
is
quite
interesting
and
well
balance
by
some
roastiness
taste
is
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
chocolate
malt
with
some
roasted
malt
providing
some
bitterness
texture
is
really
creamy
and
this
is
appreciated
considering
the
style
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
appears
an
opaque
dark
brown
almost
black
with
two
fingers
of
dark
tan
colored
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
roasted
malt
coffee
caramel
and
cocoa
tastes
of
black
licorice
and
bitter
chocolate
the
bitterness
remains
throughout
the
finish
along
with
a
mild
sourness
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
very
nice
porter
but
i
would
probably
pass
it
by
next
time
due
to
the
cost
give
it
a
shot
if
you
have
not
yet
done
so
drinkability
sweet
and
flavorful
porter
that
is
an
ultimate
session
beer
i
can
drink
this
all
day
long
for
several
days
in
a
row
without
getting
bored
must
give
this
one
a
try
d
an
abundance
of
complex
flavors
and
aromas
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
component
lend
this
porter
fantastic
drinkability
rich
and
complex
but
keeping
aplpropriately
in
porter
style
very
delicious
with
dangerously
hidden
alcohol
if
i
didnt
know
that
this
was
an
import
from
norway
i
would
have
thought
that
this
was
a
domestic
brew
as
it
is
so
fresh
in
the
style
of
an
american
porter
with
a
nod
from
englishstyle
if
you
like
good
porters
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
and
youre
in
for
a
treat
very
nice
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
aroma
but
has
a
bit
of
a
nose
tingling
sharpness
to
the
aroma
that
i
cant
pin
down
dark
brown
to
black
body
with
a
slowly
diminshing
thumb
thick
mocha
head
fore
is
slightly
smokey
and
segues
into
stale
coffee
and
chocolate
nice
roasty
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
finish
doesnt
quite
have
enough
freshness
to
the
chocolate
malt
asspect
to
it
but
still
a
pretty
spot
on
porter
some
mild
nuttiness
in
the
far
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
a
brown
ale
intense
yet
smooth
roast
flavour
with
some
coffee
black
colour
some
quality
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
also
malt
and
licorice
good
porter
not
complex
yet
satisfying
pint
well
carbonated
fresh
from

thanks
to
trade
with

condtioned
pours
with
an
excellent
thick
tan
head
pitch
black
even
when
held
to
the
light
in
a
blind
test
id
probably
say
this
was
a
dry
stout
not
guinness
maybe
even
an
imperial
aroma
of
roasted
malts
coffee
cigar
box
english
pipe
tobacco
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
flavour
is
again
roasted
malts
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
not
too
sweet
excellent
bitterness
where
you
can
sense
the
hops
as
well
as
the
roasted
malts
aroma
toasted
malt
faint
nuttiness
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
taste
sweet
malt
caramel
cola
hint
chocolate
a
little
light
for
a
porter
a
fair
enough
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
would
call
a
porter
its
boozy
and
has
a
bold
malt
presence
but
lacks
some
of
the
dark
malt
character
and
taste
that
would
make
it
more
distinct
for
the
style
seems
to
fit
more
into
a
strong
ale
or
barley
wine
category
than
a
porter
decent
yet
unimpressive
raisin
caramel
molasses
it
taste
almost
exactly
like
it
smells
except
there
is
a
minor
discernible
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
the
malts
are
the
superstar
of
this
beer
and
they
are
fantastic
it
is
medium
bodied
but
the
creamy
texture
almost
makes
it
seem
heavier
for
such
a
rich
beer
it
goes
down
very
easily
in
some
ways
this
reminds
me
of
a
dunkel
roasted
flavors
are
non
existent
as
are
fruity
ale
flavors
this
may
be
bottom
fermented
i
high
recommend
this
it
is
sweet
and
delicious
while
not
quite
the
best
porter
i
have
had
its
once
of
the
better
ones
good
amount
of
flavor
and
balance
definitely
worth
a
try
rjt
pours
a
hazy
reddish
to
brown
in
color
with
a
tannish
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
caramel
roast
in
the
taste
a
dry
roast
and
a
sticky
sweet
caramel
malt
a
bitter
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
sticky
caramel
malt
and
small
alcohol
note
in
the
aftertaste
caramel
malt
stickiness
just
ok
o
the
sweet
flavor
has
some
appeal
but
would
be
improved
with
a
bit
more
dark
malt
in
the
mix
as
well
as
a
touch
more
bittering
hops
not
what
i
expected
they
call
this
a
dubbel
i
might
rate
it
a
tad
higher
i
got
a
finger
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
from
my
pour
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
nose
had
a
caramelcoconutchocolatiness
very
sweet
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
lurking
underneath
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
caramel
was
the
prevalent
flavor
on
the
tongue
followed
by
banana
and
chocolate
talk
about
truth
in
advertising
i
did
not
transcribe
the
label
until
i
was
well
into
my
review
but
they
really
got
it
right
finish
was
still
quite
sweet
and
left
me
wondering
how
much
fermentable
sugar
remained
at
the
end
of
the
brewing
process
ill
bet
that
this
could
have
been
made
higher
in
alcohol
no
matter
it
was
a
pleasant
find
in
my
inventory
and
age
certainly
did
not
hurt
it
in
any
way
pours
a
clear
copperbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
candied
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
almost
sickly
sweet
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
much
in
my
opinion
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
having
picked
it
up
for
1
99
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
soso
at
the
most
but
this
actually
ended
up
being
a
really
good
porter
that
does
its
flavor
just
a
bit
differently
overall
this
brew
nails
that
touch
of
sharp
acidity
that
baltic
porters
are
known
for
but
it
also
stumbles
badly
at
supplying
the
roasted
malt
character
that
baltic
porters
are
also
known
for
a
mixed
bag
to
be
sure
if
it
had
some
added
complexity
and
a
healthy
dose
of
roastedness
it
could
have
been
a
real
contender
overall
this
is
just
fine
but
it
is
no
where
near
to
the
baltic
porter
style
overall
a
nice
fall
beer
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
malts
are
detected
nothing
mild
about
the
taste
malts
caramel
some
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
alcohol
good
complexity
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
not
a
baltic
porter
or
a
porter
regardless
of
what
the
bottle
or
ba
indicates
as
a
dark
beer
this
is
a
passable
example
though
its
fairly
bland
even
at
that
ok
but
ill
not
be
rushing
back
to
get
a
crate
load
500ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
shared
with
a
friend
this
bottle
was
nice
and
cheap
so
figured
wed
give
it
a
shot
because
we
were
talking
about
the
baltic
porter
style
ok
appearance
the
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
to
see
decent
head
but
retention
isnt
that
amazing
the
smell
is
not
bad
its
got
some
lager
notes
to
it
as
well
as
some
porter
not
really
a
knockout
but
pretty
interesting
the
taste
is
ok
porter
is
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
anyway
and
baltic
porter
is
not
going
to
be
either
nothing
objectionable
here
though
pretty
crisp
mouthfeel
and
overall
it
is
worth
trying
and
its
not
a
bad
value
not
terrible
but
more
of
an
oversweet
boozy
brown
ale
than
a
robust
baltic
porter
i
wont
look
for
this
one
again
all
in
all
though
nowhere
near
a
true
porter
this
very
affordable
import
was
a
great
discovery
and
i
would
never
have
associated
lithuania
with
a
beer
of
this
style
if
you
can
find
it
try
one
a
nice
evening
beer
for
this
time
of
year
though
one
will
probably
be
enough
d
flavorful
and
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
wouold
choose
first
scratching
my
head
as
to
how
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
porter
right
from
the
pour
this
clearly
doesnt
have
the
classic
dark
brownblack
color
of
a
porter
nor
were
there
any
stale
roasty
or
lightly
sour
flavors
going
on
confusing
yet
moderately
enjoyable
id
try
this
again
at
some
point
d
i
would
drink
it
if
that
is
all
that
was
there
but
it
is
at
the
low
end
of
the
bell
curve
if
you
can
get
it
go
for
it
i
recomend
this
one
highly
overall
meh
prefer
my
porters
a
little
drier
and
less
sweet
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
what
im
accustomed
i
poured
this
into
a
sam
smith
nonic
body
was
black
with
tan
head
with
little
retention
and
lacing
chocolatey
malts
dominate
the
nose
and
there
is
the
same
in
the
taste
very
little
bitterness
some
toffee
and
coffee
mixed
in
as
well
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
creamy
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
out
there
not
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
but
a
fine
example
of
the
style
ill
have
to
start
putting
a
little
more
trust
in
some
of
the
darker
beers
with
the
funny
writing
on
the
labels
d
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
really
nothing
like
id
expect
when
i
see
the
term
baltic
porter
this
is
basically
an
imperial
dunkel
take
it
for
that
and
enjoy
a
well
made
brew
the
value
is
great
1
95500
ml
overall
its
fine
totally
drinkable
but
theres
nothing
youll
really
remember
about
this
beer
if
its
around
go
right
ahead
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
a
lean
helping
of
a
baltic
with
a
dark
amber
nearly
brown
color
and
about
a
finger
an
a
half
of
head
that
had
enough
retention
to
tell
me
that
the
beer
had
a
boat
load
of
sugar
but
not
much
malt
backbone
nose
is
sweet
and
syrupy
palate
is
brown
sugar
toasty
and
coconut
has
the
density
of
a
poorly
carbonated
doppelbock
much
much
sweet
and
one
dimensional
at
that
dthis
is
a
tasty
beer
but
the
feel
is
a
little
lacking
d
to
me
it
was
a
cross
of
mad
elf
and
flyingdogs
collaborator
with
a
touch
of
strong
dark
belgian
ale
not
really
like
most
porters
ive
had
pretty
enjoyable
but
dont
expect
your
classic
porter
pours
a
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
very
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
light
chocolate
and
soyraisin
big
soy
flavor
meaty
caramel
light
red
wine
and
dark
chocolate
there
is
a
strange
metallic
bitterness
a
bit
unpleasant
moderate
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
with
a
roasty
bitterness
a
decent
porter
i
have
a
bit
of
a
mixed
reaction
it
had
an
odd
bitter
flavor
at
first
but
seems
to
mellow
as
the
beer
warmed
not
very
heavy
for
baltic
porter
but
that
is
fine
with
me
i
like
my
porters
to
be
different
than
my
stouts
this
one
is
pretty
good
i
like
most
of
the
baltic
porters
out
there
this
one
is
unique
in
a
way
but
i
dont
think
it
is
the
best
example
but
it
is
a
good
worthy
one
d
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
its
nice
i
was
intrigued
by
a
lithuanian
beer
and
gave
it
a
go
you
should
do
the
same
however
i
doubt
this
will
be
in
my
fridge
ever
again
clear
coppery
chestnut
not
even
close
to
opaque
or
dark
brown
it
was
topped
by
a
thin
yellowbeige
cap
that
quickly
fell
to
a
collar
there
was
a
bit
of
lace
too
but
this
didnt
look
anything
like
a
porter
the
aroma
was
malty
and
slightly
bready
with
a
bit
of
caramel
low
bitterness
balanced
towards
malt
sweetness
some
bread
and
caramel
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
smooth
nice
texture
overall
it
tastes
fine
but
its
not
what
i
would
call
a
porter
if
it
was
called
something
else
it
would
be
fairly
respectable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
deeper
brown
color
with
a
thick
light
brown
cap
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faint
but
there
are
noticeable
toffee
and
dark
chocolate
hints
the
taste
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
would
expect
from
a
porter
and
it
was
a
little
lighter
bodied
the
carbonation
was
a
little
much
as
well
there
was
a
nice
creamy
finish
that
was
the
best
part
of
the
brew
decent
but
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
2
50
single
price
tag
for
a
half
liter
drinkability
fairly
easy
to
drink
considering
the
alcoholpushing
7
however
youll
want
to
drink
it
slow
to
enjoy
the
toasty
creamy
caramel
sweetness
without
fatiquing
the
taste
buds
too
quickly
d
not
a
bad
drinker
fairly
nice
complexity
that
does
well
on
its
own
although
its
subtleties
dont
stand
up
to
food
as
a
sipper
this
is
fairly
easy
to
consume
however
unlike
most
porters
utenos
is
probably
best
on
its
own
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
this
is
a
fine
match
for
a
cold
and
rainy
wintery
day
i
have
never
had
this
kind
of
mouth
feel
before
and
its
actually
pretty
weird
but
in
a
good
way
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
the
sweetness
was
too
strong
and
on
the
bland
side
it
was
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
while
its
overall
an
ok
porter
just
not
something
i
would
have
again
all
of
that
said
its
not
too
bad
there
is
something
here
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
the
finish
is
actually
pretty
good
and
perhaps
its
the
pleasant
conclusion
thats
influencing
me
not
to
can
this
one
altogether
d
probably
will
not
go
back
to
this
nice
for
a
taste
d
i
really
thought
this
was
just
an
average
beer
at
best
it
certainly
didnt
meet
very
many
of
the
style
guidelines
for
a
porter
much
less
a
baltic
porter
a
good
one
to
avoid
d
i
really
liked
this
one
its
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
but
stands
well
on
its
own
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
d
for
this
price
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
was
only
1
49
for
the
500ml
bottle
its
pretty
tasty
and
goes
down
easily
ill
probably
check
this
one
out
again
and
with
some
regularity
poured
from
a
half
litre
brown
bottle
with
some
sort
of
date
code
which
i
could
not
decodepours
dark
brown
without
much
carbonation
and
with
a
thin
but
creamy
looking
off
white
head
that
dissapate
rather
quickly
nice
toasty
carmel
aroma
very
floral
for
a
lager
medium
bodied
and
smooth
to
start
with
quick
burnt
malty
chocalaty
punch
the
burnt
flavor
lingers
for
a
little
while
with
the
bitternes
a
tasty
and
unique
brew
very
nice
deep
coppery
sort
of
color
no
head
and
little
carbonation
good
strong
malty
aroma
quite
the
caramel
tinge
to
it
with
a
faint
smokiness
to
it
full
malty
flavor
again
a
heavy
caramel
presence
a
slight
burnt
sugar
flavor
comes
thru
slight
hop
bite
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
body
is
rather
thin
a
good
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
more
of
a
doppelbock
to
me
then
a
baltic
porter
but
still
quite
tasty
and
moderately
priced
nice
treat
carbonation
is
rather
low
and
it
does
have
a
creamy
sort
of
mouthfeel
this
one
may
grow
on
me
as
it
warms
and
my
palet
adjusts
im
giving
this
beer
a
thumbs
down
it
was
just
too
boozy
and
with
an
abv
with
a
reasonable
6
8
there
is
no
reason
that
the
porter
should
just
have
a
bourbon
like
alcohol
presence
from
nose
to
finish
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
brown
with
some
carbonation
the
head
lacing
retention
were
respectable
the
nose
is
loaded
up
with
caramel
malts
burnt
brown
sugars
and
lots
of
abv
the
taste
wasnt
particularly
creamy
interesting
nutty
roasted
or
toasted
malt
a
bit
syrupy
and
it
is
cloyingly
sweet
but
in
a
liqueur
like
way
the
alcohol
predominated
and
left
a
throaty
burn
that
i
just
dont
appreciate
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
and
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
interesting
picked
this
up
on
a
day
of
curiosity
at
eagle
provisions
in
park
slope
brooklyn
it
pours
a
bit
lighter
in
color
than
id
hoped
for
a
porter
and
the
head
and
lacing
are
a
bit
thin
but
man
does
it
taste
good
if
you
see
it
get
it
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
a
moderately
passably
good
beer
with
extra
consideration
given
its
country
of
origin
utenos
porter
is
a
sparkling
dense
dark
red
beer
with
a
dense
fluffy
mocha
colored
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
leaves
great
lacing
it
has
a
huge
sweet
malty
aroma
there
are
notes
of
caramel
and
berries
in
the
nose
it
is
mediumfull
bodied
its
very
soft
and
smooth
with
a
tidy
finish
it
tastes
sweet
and
a
little
roasty
there
are
notes
of
chocolate
and
licorice
maybe
strawberry
there
is
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
balanced
this
is
kind
of
a
showcase
for
caramel
malt
it
makes
for
some
tasty
sipping
lithuanian
beer
i
bought
a
bottle
at
manchester
in
hartford
i
dont
recall
seeing
it
in
michigan
or
ohio
the
beer
was
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
very
thin
head
the
smell
is
deep
malts
somewhere
between
a
dark
lager
and
a
baltic
porter
actually
closer
to
the
baltic
porter
category
with
evident
ethanol
the
taste
is
blatic
porter
but
i
didnt
appreciate
it
as
much
as
okocim
still
it
had
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
and
sweetness
the
body
is
about
right
fairly
thick
and
drinkability
is
soso
as
i
can
smell
and
taste
ethanol
not
a
good
ambassador
for
lithuania
meh
between
the
unique
color
the
odd
flavors
and
the
mediocre
mouthfeel
i
find
it
difficult
to
recommend
this
one
given
the
other
imported
baltic
porters
out
there
not
bad
and
not
a
horrible
brew
definitely
not
drainpour
level
and
certainly
interesting
to
try
but
really
not
my
cup
of
tea
not
much
about
this
beer
is
recognizable
by
other
fellow
porters
this
has
a
redbrown
color
with
a
tan
shortlived
head
lots
of
carbonation
though
their
is
a
very
powerful
scent
that
is
detectable
as
soon
as
it
starts
to
be
poured
right
out
of
the
gate
this
one
wants
to
make
a
mark
the
sweet
malts
start
to
take
over
the
air
as
you
look
from
the
bottle
to
what
you
poured
in
disbelief
that
it
came
from
the
same
bottle
a
strange
curiosity
comes
over
you
to
try
this
concoction
the
taste
is
a
little
more
familiar
to
a
porter
and
you
start
to
relax
a
little
once
you
can
find
the
bitter
tasting
hops
under
the
sweet
almost
chocolate
like
malts
you
realize
that
after
the
first
mouthful
there
isnt
much
of
a
trail
left
in
your
mouth
for
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
porter
before
you
know
it
the
glass
is
half
gone
well
might
as
well
prep
another
one
for
the
rest
of
your
review
edit
r
i
p
ha
like
the
blob
you
can
contain
me
but
you
cant
kill
me
try
masking
me
with
a
shot
of
bourbon
and
you
will
have
hell
to
pay
but
why
am
i
even
telling
you
you
know
already
dont
you
sweetheart
a
nice
baltic
porter
and
quite
inexpensive
to
boot
i
have
been
generally
pleased
with
lithuanian
brews
and
was
not
disappointed
with
this
one
try
this
one
if
you
like
baltics
taste
is
creamy
roasted
nuts
bakers
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
ends
on
the
bitter
side
with
some
smoke
drinkability
excellent
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
without
complaint
could
be
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
fairly
light
head
and
some
sloppy
lacing
smells
quite
malty
sweet
and
even
a
bit
winey
with
additional
aromas
of
cocoa
and
prunes
pretty
nice
the
taste
is
similar
and
also
very
malty
but
perhaps
a
little
less
fruity
nice
cocoa
finish
smooth
perhaps
a
tad
sticky
in
the
mouth
but
overall
quite
drinkable
caramel
toffee
malt
flavors
a
pleasant
nutty
finish
with
a
hint
of
coffee
roast
and
chocolate
sweetness
its
medium
bodied
not
as
extreme
as
okocim
porter
which
is
a
good
thing
this
beer
would
pair
well
with
food
especially
lithuanian
dishes
such
as
mushroom
soup
potato
sausage
and
pork
dishes
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
medium
brown
with
amber
tint
atight
12
finger
light
brown
head
atop
raisin
and
dark
chocolate
mainly
in
the
nose
with
some
mild
roastinessflavors
are
two
ones
sided
in
the
sweet
departmentbig
riaisn
and
molasses
flavors
melding
with
some
chocolate
after
awhile
it
starts
to
become
cloying
the
hefty
sweetness
takes
the
overall
drinkability
downone
dimensional
and
to
sweet
at
that
pretty
good
but
a
little
bland
compared
to
other
baltic
porters
that
ive
tried
also
wondering
why
its
so
light
in
color
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
some
more
roasted
malts
d
its
no
okicim
but
id
drink
it
again
not
difficult
to
drink
with
a
low
abv
but
it
is
a
rather
uninspired
baltic
porter
d
very
easy
drinking
and
versatile
as
it
seems
like
it
would
be
good
in
summer
months
as
well
as
winter
drinkability
i
had
greater
expectations
for
this
porter
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
tall
medium
bodied
tan
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
an
aroma
of
roasted
malts
some
sweet
fruit
smell
caramel
and
even
a
cream
aroma
it
tastes
of
nice
roasted
malts
followed
by
a
sweet
fruity
almost
apple
taste
that
fades
to
a
caramel
flavoring
with
hints
of
chocolate
cream
and
even
a
little
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
smooth
feel
that
refreshes
all
the
way
down
it
is
definately
drinkable
and
i
would
definately
recommend
this
if
you
dont
like
hoppy
beers
dthe
medium
body
makes
this
very
drinkableas
well
as
the
price
d
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
brew
that
would
be
great
with
assorted
chocolate
or
fondue
but
it
suffers
from
an
overabundance
of
sugar
that
kills
the
drinkability
a
bit
this
is
a
really
fine
brew
for
those
who
love
chocolate
and
heavily
malted
beers
like
doppelbocks
this
one
is
highly
underrated
on
this
site
for
the
price
i
got
it
for
this
was
an
excellent
beer
seriously
i
would
pay
another
12
on
this
brew
but
1
99
plus
an
abv
of
almost
7
makes
this
a
great
sipper
to
bring
to
a
party
or
get
together
heck
bring
a
couple
of
em
not
too
dark
easy
to
drink
and
not
very
astringent
like
other
cheaper
porters
the
tasty
price
and
pricey
taste
of
this
beer
make
it
a
good
buy
even
the
color
is
different
pouring
a
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
dissipates
a
bit
too
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
raisin
that
becomes
significantly
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
dominated
by
malty
caramel
flavors
sweet
dark
fruit
and
a
mildly
dry
balanced
finish
combined
with
its
clean
lager
character
this
is
one
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
but
you
can
still
fully
see
through
it
light
tan
head
decent
tar
like
nose
with
some
definite
malt
influences
there
a
good
touch
of
woody
sweetness
is
on
there
too
flavor
is
extremely
tangy
sweet
at
first
seems
a
bit
too
much
and
overpowering
that
goes
away
and
is
replaced
by
a
sweet
caramel
and
woody
character
its
almost
like
this
is
an
amber
ale
disguised
as
a
baltic
porter
feel
is
okay
decent
carbonation
odd
liquid
feel
that
borders
on
syrupy
and
slimy
the
verdict
is
that
this
one
just
falls
short
compared
to
all
the
other
baltic
porters
lines
up
at
eagle
provisions
where
i
got
this
there
are
certainly
better
ones
to
try
you
get
what
you
pay
for
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
onedimensional
caramel
dominates
lacks
robust
character
typical
of
the
style
even
mouthfeel
moderately
carbed
but
would
expect
less
viscosity
more
thickness
average
drinkability
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
heavily
into
porter
utenos
is
a
lithuanian
product
in
a
bright
gold
label
that
should
attract
porter
fans
its
deep
dark
body
is
quite
nice
though
it
provides
little
head
utenos
has
a
sweet
taste
with
caramel
and
a
molasses
taste
and
texture
to
it
yet
oddly
enough
without
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
its
smooth
taste
masks
the
moderately
high
6
8
alcohol
count
and
makes
it
easy
to
enjoy
a
couple
i
first
enjoyed
utenos
with
barbecued
pork
chops
and
it
complemented
the
meat
very
well
one
of
my
favorite
porters
utenos
goes
great
with
dinner
with
dessert
or
just
relaxing
with
friends
its
also
equally
good
as
a
way
to
beat
the
heat
or
to
enjoy
on
the
porch
in
the
dead
of
winter
very
good
porter
and
well
worth
trying
who
spiked
my
malta
seriously
is
this
beer
or
just
a
bad
soft
drink
gone
bad
der
i
couldnt
quite
place
the
smell
but
from
what
i
can
remember
this
is
what
malta
smells
like
doesnt
even
resemble
malt
or
beer
just
a
sickly
sweet
sort
of
caramel
i
took
maybe
two
sips
and
gave
up
didnt
taste
like
beer
let
alone
porter
and
certainly
not
like
a
real
baltic
porter
waste
of
2
drinkability
it
basically
comes
down
to
that
this
beer
is
fun
to
look
at
and
smell
at
the
same
time
ok
to
drink
but
dont
look
forward
to
receive
the
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
and
smelling
this
beer
again
in
the
future
but
i
sure
as
hell
hope
that
this
beer
still
doesnt
have
that
rust
aftertaste
to
it
in
the
future
this
beer
shows
amazing
carbonation
as
i
get
almost
four
fingers
of
rich
tan
head
with
large
hollow
bubbles
body
is
a
blackish
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
very
inviting
nose
has
rich
dark
raisen
and
plum
notes
with
sweet
malt
and
a
noticeable
maple
feel
on
first
sip
let
me
just
say
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
amazing
smooth
dark
fruit
notes
are
all
over
the
palate
very
malty
with
underlined
sweetness
throughout
the
palate
hints
of
anise
and
maple
are
present
also
a
slight
soured
feel
develops
on
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
makes
a
nice
winter
warmer
poured
in
a
guinness
glass
with
a
nice
thick
frothy
mocha
head
the
settled
down
after
a
few
minutes
the
color
is
a
deep
clear
mahogany
with
a
touch
of
brick
red
there
are
chocolate
and
raisins
on
the
nose
and
hints
reminiscent
of
the
leathery
cherry
notes
from
a
belgian
quadruple
so
far
my
hopes
are
up
and
now
to
taste
alas
the
taste
falls
short
of
the
initial
impression
it
is
weaker
in
body
than
the
6
8
alcohol
would
suggest
flavors
open
with
a
caramel
malt
and
settle
into
a
leathery
raisin
character
the
finish
is
an
unpleasant
tangy
astringent
coffee
ground
flavor
lingering
along
with
alas
body
yes
there
it
is
a
thick
sweetness
sitting
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
playing
with
roasted
malt
and
that
bad
coffee
bite
worth
drinking
once
but
no
need
to
revisit
500ml
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
initially
large
tan
head
that
quickly
diminishes
into
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
some
dark
fruit
and
malt
the
taste
is
very
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
that
helps
to
balance
the
sweetness
somewhat
the
taste
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
and
could
use
some
more
hops
to
help
balance
overall
this
is
a
rather
average
porter
that
merely
blends
in
with
all
the
others
it
does
not
posses
anything
that
stands
out
and
makes
me
want
to
purchase
again
medium
body
with
fairly
light
carbonation
drinkability
just
a
little
more
alcohol
presence
than
i
wanted
i
liked
the
taste
just
didnt
seem
to
want
a
lot
of
it
ok
porter
rich
yet
not
all
that
dark
looks
and
can
pass
as
a
brown
good
head
carmel
with
bitterness
felt
along
with
sugar
and
on
the
overdone
side
tabacco
and
old
coffee
grinds
drinkable
not
all
that
complexmedium
mouthfeel
worth
experiencing
to
get
a
range
of
baltic
porters
but
i
would
not
say
the
most
representative
and
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
feels
fairly
alcoholic
especially
if
youre
drinking
500ml
bottles
for
some
reason
i
thought
utenos
porter
would
be
better
than
it
is
its
decent
beer
but
it
fails
miserably
when
compared
to
its
better
known
competitors
if
i
was
lithuanian
id
make
regular
beer
runs
across
the
border
into
poland
to
buy
okocim
porter
by
the
case
pours
a
clear
redorange
thick
off
white
head
nice
lacing
good
retention
not
a
porter
let
alone
a
baltic
porter
smell
is
sweet
toffee
and
apples
some
chocolate
not
much
aroma
taste
is
sweet
apples
and
caramel
again
dark
fruits
weird
buttery
flavour
definately
not
a
porter
mouthfeel
is
thin
medium
to
light
carbonation
safe
to
say
this
is
not
a
porter
by
any
other
name
it
may
be
better
drinkability
is
ok
its
an
enjoyable
beer
but
definitely
not
a
porter
call
it
something
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
itd
probably
score
higher
but
this
misses
the
mark
for
a
porter
this
is
a
light
brown
color
with
a
decent
white
fluffy
head
the
nose
is
pungent
and
full
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
with
a
touch
of
molasses
or
syrup
the
taste
is
good
full
baltic
profile
with
a
black
bean
flavor
meets
malt
and
even
a
little
smoke
the
taste
suffers
from
the
thinner
body
of
the
beer
which
i
think
would
be
better
a
little
more
concentrated
very
drinkable
though
it
is
light
enough
to
be
an
all
nighter
but
full
enough
to
complement
beef
to
chinese
to
indian
food
served
in
a
22oz
bottle
subtle
but
appealing
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
light
brownish
foam

foam
into
my
pint
glass
the
nose
is
a
noticeable
etoh
that
hovers
the
glass
and
roasted
hops
to
balance
with
distinct
sweet
malt
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
comes
into
the
palate
with
many
malt
flavors
there
is
a
carameltoffee
malt
in
there
but
other
complex
flavors
come
out
and
are
very
welcoming
there
is
a
nice
mildmedium
body
to
this
porter
i
would
recommend
this
because
its
good
but
if
thats
not
enough
for
good
international
relations
post
cold
war
not
what
i
expected
from
a
porter
even
a
baltic
porter
strikes
me
as
more
of
an
aggressive
scottish
ale
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
large
head
with
tiny
bubbles
that
lace
the
glass
as
it
recedes
has
somewhat
of
a
roastchocolate
smell
a
little
sweetness
to
the
smell
smooth
with
a
little
fruity
aftertaste
has
a
roasted
beginning
that
mellows
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
that
warms
the
pallate
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
mouthfeel
was
creamy
yet
not
overly
filling
not
necessarily
what
i
thought
id
get
given
the
very
light
color
but
a
pleasant
surprise
and
reasonably
true
to
style
a
nice
drinkable
easy
beer
and
something
id
probably
buy
again
though
i
wouldnt
necessarily
beat
feet
to
get
at
it
i
like
it
d
this
is
a
straight
forward
beer
with
nice
flavor
not
overly
impressive
but
enjoyable
md
ideal
mouthfeel
smooth
creamy
wo
intrusive
fizziness
and
the
body
for
a
6
8abv
is
quite
approachable
with
very
little
sign
of
alc
until
the
very
end
of
tasting
all
in
all
i
quite
enjoy
this
beer
that
is
a
quality
product
albeit
without
much
complexity
and
it
really
triggers
my
interest
in
other
lithuanian
brews
cheers
i
can
see
drinking
this
in
a
baltic
winter
with
only
4
hours
of
daylight
and
this
is
needed
to
keep
you
warm
d
drinkability
is
higher
as
the
taste
is
strong
and
sweet
utenos
porter
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
along
the
edges
with
a
light
tan
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
malty
aroma
no
hops
noticeable
sweet
and
malty
both
in
aroma
and
flavor
this
isnt
really
a
porter
imho
kind
of
one
dimensional
not
bad
mind
you
but
not
complex
decent
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
insipid
followed
by
a
severely
offputting
foul
chocolate
flavor
that
transforms
into
a
nauseating
sweetness
as
it
warms
one
sip
alone
is
enough
to
tell
me
this
is
going
down
the
drain
easy
to
drink
almost
7
abv
is
not
noticable
perfect
for
cool
autumn
nights
overall
a
strange
porter
like
no
other
ive
ever
tasted
as
i
said
earlier
its
a
bit
like
a
flanders
red
ale
crossed
with
a
porter
certainly
worth
a
try
d
this
beer
is
smooth
light
and
crisp
did
they
put
the
right
beer
in
here
there
are
little
qualities
of
a
porter
this
is
a
decent
baltic
porter
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
roastedness
to
come
through
but
no
problems
finishing
this
one
this
might
be
my
first
lithuanian
beer
expectedly
its
a
baltic
porter
quite
impressed
has
a
solid
base
of
barley
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
estery
qualities
show
up
in
the
form
of
grapes
koolaid
and
plumbs
a
soft
confectionate
sugar
flavor
keeps
the
beer
a
bit
sweet
the
body
continues
to
firm
up
through
the
drink
but
never
gets
thick
has
a
mildly
roasty
toasty
finish
with
residual
sweetness
pretty
true
to
style
though
i
would
have
prefered
a
better
hop
balance
and
spiciness
alcohols
are
conveniently
hidden
for
easy
drinkability
tasty
beer
but
im
looking
for
something
a
little
bigger
in
a
baltic
porter
the
aroma
is
serious
bigtime
chocolate
and
caramel
its
very
sweet
smell
similar
to
but
not
quite
molasses
not
much
in
the
way
of
black
malt
aroma
theres
a
mild
oil
industrial
quality
to
the
aroma
thats
difficult
to
place
theres
very
little
hops
in
the
smell
but
instead
theres
a
dark
fruit
and
yeast
quality
slight
alcohol
nose
the
taste
is
extremely
sweet
with
a
chocolate
sugary
quality
again
not
much
hop
flavor
the
beer
is
a
little
metallic
just
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
provides
a
relief
from
the
sweetness
despite
its
syrupy
sicklysweetness
i
found
the
beer
to
be
very
interesting
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
the
aroma
is
sort
of
fun
and
the
thick
and
satisfying
certainly
it
has
flaws
but
its
also
engaging
if
youre
looking
for
those
dark
roasty
porter
flavors
so
common
in
the
baltic
porters
look
elsewhere
but
if
you
want
a
darker
sweet
beer
with
slight
roasty
characteristics
you
could
do
alot
worse
this
porter
poured
a
cloudy
dark
reddish
color
with
tan
foam
that
settled
flat
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
was
malty
with
some
notes
of
chocolate
it
was
tangy
and
slightly
sour
the
moutfheel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
but
it
was
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
the
chocolate
malt
flavors
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
an
ok
baltic
porter
d
i
cannot
see
myself
ordering
one
of
these
at
a
bar
or
buying
another
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
moderate
slightly
offwhite
puffy
head
not
very
porterlike
in
appearance
smell
is
summer
fruity
mixed
with
a
bit
of
caramel
kind
of
like
a
dark
lager
taste
is
upfront
very
sweet
like
a
heavy
scottish
ale
finish
is
more
sweetness
and
little
else
what
a
darn
confusing
beer
it
doesnt
quite
seem
to
know
what
it
wants
to
be
certainly
not
a
porter
pretty
true
to
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
be
hankering
on
it
all
night
long
pours
a
clear
light
reddish
brown
under
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to
film
and
collar
no
lace
the
strong
sweet
caramel
nose
immediately
kicks
the
salivary
glands
into
gear
the
mouth
is
fairly
prickly
and
fairly
clean
with
just
a
bit
of
syrupy
stickiness
the
taste
is
defined
by
sugary
sweetness
with
caramel
up
the
wazoo
the
hops
are
dormant
at
first
but
get
stronger
as
the
session
continues
the
bitterness
is
never
a
bite
but
rather
a
bit
of
dryness
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
is
very
smooth
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
in
the
aftertaste
too
a
bit
too
sweet
there
is
a
bitter
background
chicory
but
it
is
overwhelmed
by
the
rest
drinkability
it
will
be
drunk
but
i
dont
have
much
of
an
urge
to
have
another
i
had
to
try
it
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
as
their
are
far
better
baltics
to
be
had
wierd
i
thought
this
was
a
porter
but
the
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
really
good
scottish
ale
lol
the
colour
is
a
tawny
brown
colour
with
a
tan
head
very
light
for
the
style
the
taste
is
malt
and
old
raisins
with
a
real
nice
sweetish
finish
the
midbody
was
slightly
vinous
at
times
but
really
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
the
thing
is
i
tasted
a
wee
heavy
not
a
baltic
porter
overall
comments
seems
like
this
beer
is
true
to
style
in
almost
every
way
and
yet
this
beer
should
be
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
very
good
especially
on
a
very
cold
night
like
tonight
but
im
certain
there
are
better
bps
out
there
for
me
to
be
consuming
nonetheless
if
offered
one
id
drink
it

its
intriguing
in
a
way
as
if
at
any
second
its
going
to
transform
into
this
incredible
beer
who
knows
it
may
happen
for
you
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
denmark
deep
reddish
brown
colour
not
as
dark
as
many
other
baltic
porters
large
light
brown
head
malty
sweet
aroma
hints
of
roastiness
dried
dark
fruits
and
bakery
very
sweet
and
malty
flavour
verging
on
cloying
but
is
not
over
the
hilltop
just
enough
hops
to
keep
my
interest
mellow
and
rounded
mouthfeel
again
associations
of
something
out
of
a
bakery
faint
hints
of
roastiness
and
coffee
in
the
background
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
maybe
too
sweet
but
still
pleasant
enough
to
convince
me
to
buy
it
again
on
a
day
my
sweet
tooth
needs
to
be
satisfied
i
will
buy
this
again
taste
is
deeper
than
the
smell
more
raisins
plums
and
prunes
very
sweet
with
chocolate
and
caramel
around
in
there
mouthfeel
is
bubbley
full
and
chewy
very
nice
on
the
whole
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
the
world
as
its
so
sweet
but
i
liked
it
i
went
back
and
forth
on
whether
or
not
it
was
too
sweet
and
overall
i
think
it
is
but
its
a
good
solid
beer
this
is
much
too
syrupy
for
my
likings
and
the
drinkability
is
low
this
will
be
the
first
and
the
last
of
this
brew
that
i
ever
try
the
raisinness
is
over
done
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
over
done
this
gets
a
bit
cloying
after
awhile
but
at
the
same
time
it
finds
new
ways
to
grow
on
you
there
were
times
when
i
thought
i
didnt
like
it
then
i
had
another
sip
and
something
new
poked
out
at
me
overall
this
was
interesting
and
a
positive
experience
overall
a
decent
sweet
porter
my
first
brew
from
lithuania
and
a
relatively
cheap
one
so
id
recommend
trying
it
not
a
great
porter
by
any
means
but
a
decent
one
for
the
price
a
brownish
red
beer
has
a
big
foamy
beige
head
with
some
lace
there
is
a
sweet
raisin
character
that
dominates
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
more
plummy
than
raisin
the
finish
has
a
light
bitter
coffee
note
to
attempt
some
balance
to
the
sweetness
as
i
find
myself
enjoying
more
bitterness
in
beers
i
find
i
enjoy
this
style
less
but
still
it
is
a
good
example
of
this
style
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
in
a
night
its
just
not
a
drinker
for
the
most
part
one
after
dinner
would
be
ok
by
me
pours
deep
brown
chestnut
with
a
three
fingered
sodalike
head
with
acceptable
retention
that
falls
to
a
clinging
sheet
that
seals
the
surface
and
provides
a
little
lace
aromas
of
dark
fruits
plumbs
and
burnt
raisons
with
underlying
toffee
and
caramel
malts
taste

sweet
top

burnt
flavors

abv
pretty
well
hidden
with
the
alcohol
providing
a
dry
finish
almost
more
of
a
fruity
dopplebock
taste
than
a
porter
served
in
pint
glass
5560f
for
me
one
halflitre
bottle
was
enough
bottle
obtained
at
liquor

and
consumed
the
next
evening
pours

brown
head
over
a
very
cloudy
dark
rust
redorange
liquid
smells
sharp
clean
like
a
lager
caramel
and
some
chocolate
also
some
green
apple
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
tastes
caramel
and
caramel
sour
chocolate
is
minimal
as
i
expected
from
the
color
too
light
for
a
porter
imo
theres
little
else
to
this
beer
wow
its
not
often
i
dump
a
beer
but
this
really
isnt
worth
my
time
what
a
piece
of
shit
beer
save
your
time
and
pocketbook
for
something
else
md
mouthfeel
and
moderately
carbonated
pours
with
a
fivefinger
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
hardly
any
lace
deep
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
nose
is

starts
sweet
the
alcohol
is
there
but
also
burnt

good
value

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
one
inch
of
pale
tanleather
head
is
noisy
the
clear
brown
beer
has
rusty
highlights
the
aroma
has
some
nice
butter
toffee
and
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
ha
nuts
and
raisins
in
front
the
middle
is
full
with
plenty
of
dark
malt
raisins
galore
in
the
end
toffee
and
alcohol
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
a
fruity
toffee
porter
nice
it
would
make
a
good
fruity
sweet
session
porter
overall
a
mild
porter
with
high
alcohol
500
ml
bottle
no
freshness
dating
sweetness
pushes
cloy
in
a
not
always
pleasant
way
thinness
helps
if
from
being
too
filling
strong
bock
like
qualities
there
is
a
sweetness
excess
that
takes
away
from
the
overall
pleasure
poured
black
with
a
touch
of
turbidity
flavor
was
pretty
unimpressive
for
a
baltic
porter
a
bit
thin
with
a
lactic
sourness
overlapping
a
winelike
astringency
alcohol
flavor
was
brusk
lacked
the
sturdy
roasted
malt
flavors
i
associate
with
the
style
i
would
recommend
trying
this
if
you
see
it
drinkability
putting
away
500
ml
of
something
this
sweet
is
a
real
challenge
the
sweet
brandy
soaked
fig
flavor
has
potential
but
it
needs
to
be
counterbalanced
with
something
more
robust
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
mostly
raisins
toffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
sweet
as
well
but
had
a
lot
of
raisin
hints
but
its
nothing
like
a
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
way
too
light
and
the
drinkability
is
just
ok
this
brew
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
fluffy
ivory
head
the
nose
is
full
of
candied
fig
lots
of
sweetness
not
what
i
was
looking
for
the
flavor
is
more
like
a
belgian
ale
with
candied
sugar
sweetness
and
fig
not
the
roasty
and
darkness
i
want
in
a
baltic
porter
the
feel
is
moderate
with
an
active
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
average
brew
nothing
really
grabs
me
but
its
not
bad
at
2
45
a
pop
its
not
a
bad
value
sweet
chocolately
smell
and
taste
smooth
and
creamy
goes
down
very
easy
a
tasty
bargain
at
2
45
for
1
pt
0
9
fl
oz
500ml
bottle
this
one
poured
a
clear
lighter
brown
color
there
was
a
fairly
substantial
tan
head
to
it
that
dropped
off
fairly
quickly
i
wasnt
expecting
the
aroma
that
i
got
it
had
very
nice
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
without
being
overly
sweet
maybe
a
hint
of
fruits
also
medium
bodied
taste
with
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
slightly
chocolate
notes
and
hints
of
bitterness
this
was
good
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
the
darker
baltic
porters
it
pours
a
handsome
mahogany
brown
body
with
maybe
a
slight
haze
the
head
builds
easily
but
is
shortlived
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
slight
touch
of
prunes
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
a
caramelized
flour
taste
similar
to
the
breading
on
fried
chicken
the
finish
lingers
with
a
slight
dried
pear
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
almost
covered
by
the
sweetness
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
is
okthis
beer
is
not
as
thin
as
it
looks
huge
tan
head
after
a
normal
pour
looks
very
nice
dark
brown
slightly
red
color
that
is
crystal
clear
smell
is
of
espresso
beans
slightly
sweet
with
traces
of
acidity
not
as
flavorful
as
the
appearance
would
make
you
believe
alcohol
is
dominant
in
the
flavor
with
the
musty
coffee
flavor
in
the
background
from
start
to
finish
not
bad
but
couldve
been
better
pours
a
hazy
milky
brown
not
the
dark
brown
i
was
expecting
short
lived
tan
head
leaves
behind
sparse
lacing
it
has
nice
malty
sweet
aroma
like
one
would
expect
for
the
style
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
very
short
lived
but
pleasantly
bitter
aftertaste
the
pricing
on
this
beer
is
fair
and
i
will
have
to
pick
up
some
more
for
the
larder
a
large
375ml
bottle
looks
inviting
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
walnut
color
lighter
than
one
would
expect
for
this
style
it
had
a
cereal
nose
bread
almost
toasty
and
the
taste
is
of
burnt
sugar
alcohol
and
roasted
malts
it
does
develop
a
bit
over
time
and
temperature
but
theres
little
payoff
in
the
end
and
the
alcohol
is
apparent
and
poorly
hidden
and
although
most
porters
will
fool
you
and
are
actually
a
bit
less
fullbodied
than
one
thinks
this
one
is
just
too
light
for
my
taste
its
not
terrible
but
there
are
too
many
other
great
inexpensive
beers
in
this
style
that
are
readily
available
orange
to
copper
with
reddish
tones
decent
offwhite
head
lasts
a
bunch
of
minutes
big
syrupy
smell
concentrated
malt
star
anise
sweet
berry
fruitiness
it
reminds
me
of
a
baby
samichlaus
highly
carbonated
surprisingly
alcohol
is
very
obvious
especially
for
a
beer
not
topping
7
leaves
a
burn
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
sweet
flavor
profile
a
bit
too
much
for
me
ultimately
big
caramel
candy
alone
could
be
a
pleasure
for
fans
of
sweet
beers
but
combined
with
the
intense
alcohol
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
finish
a
whole
bottle
this
is
some
wierd
stuff
not
sure
what
to
make
out
of
it
it
pours
a
murky
cherrybrown
with
a
large
beige
head
smell
is
of
vinegar
alcohol
maybe
some
prunes
bourbon
definitely
strange
this
is
not
like
any
porter
ive
yet
sampled
taste
is
much
of
the
same
bourbon
figs
prunes
alcohol
and
a
ridiculous
sweetness
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
beers
drinkability
while
not
as
bad
as
the
horrid
black
abbot
its
pretty
gross
as
far
as
sweetness
goes
i
also
had
the
wierdest
dream
ever
after
drinking
this
so
be
warned
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
average
and
nonoffensive
great
starter
beer
for
those
wanting
to
try
a
darker
beer
although
i
like
the
flavor
in
having
one
pint
the
drinkability
is
not
so
great
i
can
only
have
one
bottle
i
dont
want
a
second
and
i
think
i
might
get
sick
if
i
have
another
must
be
the
black
olives
in
the
aroma
that
turn
me
off
to
drinking
any
more
than
one
pint
thanks
to
johnnyduvel
for
the
oppurtunity
to
try
it
out
this
is
too
sweet
for
a
porter
lacks
the
deep
roastiness
and
coffee
hints
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
a
lot
closer
in
flavor
profile
and
body
to
a
doppelbock
than
a
porter
that
being
said
its
a
decent
doppelbock
but
only
a
soso
porter
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
with
or
wo
food
absolutely
one
of
the
best
porters
ever
a
pleasnat
surprise
dicovered
on
my
weekly
package
store
visit
today
beaytutiful
dark
amber
copper
color
with
a
cloudy
pillow
like
head
smell
was
sweet
malty
with
a
raisin
aroma
taste
was
initially
sweet
with
fruity
and
aclohol
undertones
mouthfeel
was
smooth
enough
for
the
style
and
finished
in
a
light
bitterness
very
drinkable
especially
as
it
warmed
smooth
qualities
additionally
it
reminded
me
of
a
brandy
very
nice
worth
a
try
dont
drink
ice
cold
drinkability
this
isnt
like
a
regular
porter
but
i
think
id
buy
it
again
doppelbock
even
a
darker
than
average
maibock
seems
to
be
a
more
accurate
classification
though
sure
its
not
too
hoppy
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
does
it
this
is
ok
for
one
pint
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
repeated
downing
i
was
rather
disappointed
in
this
as
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
a
baltic
porter
all
day
aldaris
from
nearby
latvia
is
head
and
shoulders
above
this
this
is
an
easy
drinking
sweetish
version
somewhat
underwhelming
and
nowhere
near
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
as
its
missing
a
crucial
element
with
the
absent
roastedness
nevertheless
its
entirely
pleasant
clear
and
reddish
tan
with
a
thick
orangish
brown
head
big
doughy
malt
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
licorice
and
molasses
medium
bodied
soft
and
smooth
flavor
is
really
sweet
like
a
doppelbock
in
my
opinion
roasted
malt
with
licorice
and
noticable
alcohol
in
the
finish
overall
an
average
baltic
porter
nice
carbonation
per
style
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
with
the
heavy
alcohol
taste
i
would
only
have
one
per
sitting
interesting
interpretation
of
style
from
lithuania
drinkability

id
give
this
a
4
if
it
wasnt
for
the
sorry
grain
killjoy
hidden
in
the
depths
of
this
sweet
ale
a
nice
enough
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
porter
comes
in
a
completely
undistinguishedlooking
500
ml
bottle
brown
bottle
with
a
flat
gold
label
and
black
lettering
oh
well
lithuania
has
never
been
known
as
a
flash
country
the
color
is
surprisingly
light
for
a
porter
in
fact
the
lightest
porter
ive
seen
it
looks
more
like
old
crustacean
than
anchor
porter
the
head
is
nothing
more
than
a
memory
almost
immediately
leaving
behind
what
looks
like
a
glassfull
of
bittersweet
chocolate
although
the
smell
of
roasted
malt
is
present
its
on
the
light
side
the
most
assertive
flavor
is
a
fairly
strong
chocolate
hops
are
barely
noticeable
all
in
all
a
decent
effort
but
im
really
looking
forward
to
the
carnegie
stark
porter
thats
sitting
in
the
fridge
fairly
sweet
taste
up
front
with
a
corresponding
medium
body
lightly
bitter
in
the
finish
with
notes
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
roast
malt
and
a
finish
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
this
tastes
like
it
might
be
intentionally
sweetened
at
bottling
time
the
sweetness
seems
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
the
body
of
this
beer
needs
to
be
thicker
to
pull
it
off
interesting
though
only
6
8
the
alcohol
is
quite
evident
in
this
beer
this
is
a
tasty
beverage
and
if
you
can
handle
a
rather
sweet
beer
than
this
is
one
for
you
to
try
dark
ruby
in
color
with
a
pillowy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
into
a
fine
lace
not
very
chocolatey
for
a
porter
i
am
instead
overwhelmed
by
brown
sugar
that
sugar
sweetness
hits
my
taste
buds
immediately
and
lingers
long
after
my
sip
is
finished
a
tiny
bit
of
raisen
flavor
but
overall
just
a
onedimensional
beer
this
beer
had
a
small
sized
tan
head
with
finemedium
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
diminishing
the
body
was
normal
for
a
baltic
porter
with
carbonation
observed
and
it
had
a
brown
hue
the
aroma
was
mildly
malty
and
the
flavor
consisted
of
malt
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
light
bodied
and
somewhat
thin
the
lacing
was
fair
overall
not
a
bad
effort
and
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
baltika
say
but
whilst
this
had
plenty
of
toasted
malts
it
had
very
little
roasted
character
and
very
little
bitterness
if
any
this
was
nevertheless
certainly
well
worth
the
excursion
for
the
experience
but
probably
not
the
price
of
2
50
now
if
this
was
bottleconditioned
it
may
well
have
been
a
different
story
very
different
from
most
any
other
porter
youll
have
but
good
enough
in
its
own
right
as
the
others
mentioned
this
baltic
porter
pours
out
much
lighter
in
color
than
what
most
of
us
are
used
to
kinda
like
a
bock
or
light
dopplebock
has
a
rusty
burnt
amber
to
brown
color
nearly
opaque
once
you
get
past
the
color
you
notice
some
other
differences
as
well
the
aroma
is
sweet
creamy
carmels
and
slighty
toasted
malt
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
lack
the
bitterness
and
roasted
flavors
indeed
a
completely
different
style
of
beer
toasted
and
sweet
carmel
candy
taste
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
heat
faint
chocolate
tastes
or
did
i
just
talk
myself
into
that
smooth
and
mellow
not
roasted
or
bitterness
definitly
worth
a
try
and
unique
i
liked
it
just
get
out
of
your
head
porter
or
read
up
baltic
porters
before
trying
them
the
flavor
is
not
complex
but
it
is
still
satisfying
roasted
maltiness
upfront
with
fading
sweetness
and
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
the
body
seems
a
bit
light
for
the
style
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
this
poued
into
the
glass
with
an
attractive
rocky
longlived
cream
colored
head
settles
to
a
deep
rubybrown
very
lightly
carbonated
brew
there
was
liquorice
and
molasses
in
the
nose
along
with
a
nice
amount
of
malt
the
taste
started
sweet
with
more
molasses
and
a
herbal
hop
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
followed
by
a
hint
of
alcoholic
warmth
finishes
sweet
and
long
with
a
slight
drying
bitterness
at
the
end
i
only
knock
the
appearance
down
due
to
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
resemble
a
porter
lighter
in
color
however
if
this
was
listed
as
a
doppelbock
i
would
be
quite
pleased
reminds
me
of
a
moretti
larossa
sweet
smooth
and
creamy
nice
taste
nice
head
good
retention
some
lacing
smells
of
sweet
carmel
some
alcohol
really
a
cross
between
a
porter
and
a
bock
whatever
the
category
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
try
again
stereotypes
are
wrong
but
when
i
think
porter
i
think
dark
this
is
the
second
time
ive
seen
a
porter
that
poured
like
a
brown
ale
1st
was
the
belgian
poorter
from
the
sterkens
brewery
but
thats
another
tale
my
guard
is
up
and
im
definitely
not
expecting
the
pleasingly
balanced
roasted
flavor
that
entices
my
taste
buds
from
the
very
first
sip
the
smell
is
sweet
and
the
taste
is
a
sweet
malty
start
with
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
finish
mild
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
are
present
making
this
beer
and
excellent
finisher
for
the
evening
while
it
may
be
not
as
robust
as
some
of
the
other
baltic
porters
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
kudos
to
lithuania
on
this
one
this
beer
does
not
look
like
a
porter
at
all
its
dark
amber
and
semitransparent
you
can
see
some
sediment
in
it
interesting
pours
a
thick
foamy
head
looks
great
but
the
head
does
not
last
long
smells
sweet
and
fruity
tastes
sweet
too
just
a
little
smoky
some
hints
of
honey
in
there
too
pretty
good
mouthfeel
very
interesting
taste
leaves
you
with
a
lot
to
think
about
such
as
what
the
hell
is
going
on
in
my
mouth
right
now
the
color
deep
ruby
red
on
the
pour
the
head
monstrous
in
size
frothy
in
its
texture
the
lace
a
nice
clinging
sheet
to
seal
off
the
glass
lightly
toasted
grains
sweet
like
caramel
candy
quite
pleasant
to
the
nose
the
start
quite
sweet
and
malt
laden
top
is
middling
in
feel
finish
has
a
pertinent
hop
spicy
bite
the
carbonation
moderate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
a
decent
porter
not
great
but
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
porter
from
lithuania
in
a
thick
brown
half
liter
bottle
a
premium
dark
beer
a
very
deep
ruby
color
when
held
up
to
light
that
is
surprisingly
clear
the
head
is
a
coffee
with
cream
color
and
the
head
dissipated
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
clean
and
not
overwhelming
the
taste
is
malt
at
the
beginning
and
chocolateburnt
malts
toward
the
end
with
a
very
clean
finish
slight
alcohol
warmth
nothing
special
its
ok
but
nothing
special
nefarious
ten
pin
is
decent
enough
but
for
my
tastes
falls
short
of
greatness
i
dont
regret
my
purchase
but
wont
be
repeating
it
overall
good
really
enjoy
the
dark
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
notes
and
how
they
meld
together
it
reminds
me
of
ten
fidys
younger
brother
the
only
problem
i
had
was
its
not
as
smooth
and
creamy
and
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
22oz
bottle
that
i
picked
up
for
6

dark
black
with
a
small
head
looks

an

aroma
is
sweet
dark
malts
flavor
was
sweet
dark
malts
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
an
imperial
stout
overall
not
bad
worth
7
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
feel
smooth
near
medium
body
passable
not
in
the
same
class
with
ris
but
then
since
its
an
imperial
porter
one
would
expect
it
to
be
less
flavorful
and
thinner
which
it
is
this
is
not
bad
with
the
appearance
of
the
head
lacing
and
body
raising
the
score
while
the
weak
flavor
lowers
it
worth
trying
i
have
another
bottle
which
ill
age
and
try
again
in
a
year
or
two
overall
hmm
the
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
are
a
little
synthetic
and
off
putting
after
such
a
solid
wax
job
on
the
bottle
i
had
high
hopes
because
we
all
know
wax
topping
means
its
going
to
be
a
good
brew
i
enjoyed
this
more
as
i
went
as
it
took
some
time
to
settle
in
but
once
my
palate
warmed
to
it
i
found
it
enjoyable
overall
not
much
of
an
imperial
porter

thru

big

the

there
is
one
aroma
that
is
slightly

and
the

is
great
but
it
is
a

sweet

go
any

this
is
a

very

very

this

and
easily

baltic

ive
had

any

tastewise
it
is
very

the
body
is
not
overly
heavy
and
has
a
nice
smooth

overall
drinkability
seems
to
hit
the
style
pretty
well
what
it
lacks
in
lacing
and
mouthfeel
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
aroma
and
taste
while
i
enjoyed
this
i
cannot
say
i
would
want
more
than
one
an
evening
still
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
a
little
strong
for
me
bitter

toasty
flavors
o
lovely
richness
and
bold

but
it

this
beer
may
however
be
an
excellent
candidate
for
barrelaging
poured
a
black

beer
is
light

a

more
sweet
than
roasted
with
a
slight
overbalance
of
chocolate
possible
vanilla
sugary
sweetness
over
roasted

nonetheless
well
crafted
beer
that
controls
itself
has
a
clean
finish
that
complements
rest
of
beer
and
the
abv
is
wellhidden
no
idea
it
was
this
high
overall
wow
i
like
this
beer
i
really
like
the
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
and
the
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
certainly
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
the
duckrabbit
overall
not
bad
but
suffers
in
comparison
with
some
other
baltic
porters
that
ive
sampled
if
the
taste
matched
the
smell
wed
be
talking
about
a
winner
im
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
again
with
other
options
available
it
pains
me
to
write
an
unfavorable
review
because
i
normally
appreciate
duck
rabbits
offerings
this
just
doesnt
seem
like
any
baltic
porter
ive
ever
had
its
nicely
colored
but
its
plum
cherry
and
raisin
flavors
are
to
my
palate
truly
excessive
almost
resulting
in
a
coughsyrupy
sweetness
ill
come
back
to
it
again
in
a
week
to
give
it
another
chance
but
for
now
i
think
its
a
miss
o
i
think
this
would
typically
be
an
excellent
baltic
porter
but
something
made
it
turn
a
bit
tart
not
sure
i
get
this
beer
sharp
and
prickly
sour
which
thins
it
out
and
gives
big
thin
head
huge
burst
of
competing
sweetness
the
added
roasty
flavors
dont
help
i
tried
to
let
it
warm
and
nothing
helped
couldnt
drink
more
than
2oz
infected
o
overall
not
bad
but
isnt
really
doing
it
for
me
a
bit
too
much
sweet
sugary
and
not
enough
roastiness
not
that
the
beer
is
done
poorly
but
perhaps
just
isnt
my
thing
poured
ontap
at
the
brewery
and
served
in
a
nonic
pint
the
beer
is
a
jet
black
slick
and
oillike
coloring
with
a
halo
of
light
tan
head
nose
of
rich
date
molasses
and
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
flavors
are
rich
and
roasted
with
bitter
chocolate
and
black
strap
molasses
forward
with
hints
of
smoke
and
charred
wood
character
rich
and
perfectly
balanced
on
a
smooth

body
the
aftertaste
is
richly
sweet
with
hints

smoke

finish
with
a
roasted
linger
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
rest
medium
bodied
highly
drinkable
balanced
and
wellhidden
alcohol
make
this
a
great
brew
o
i
have
chosen
wisely
for
my
first
baltic
porter
sweet
smoky
semi
bitter
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
i
will
have
to
grab
a
six
of
this
next
time
in
our
cheers
o
i
would
buy
this
beer
over
and
over
again
it
is
one
that
is
best
enjoyed
with
the
company
of
others
i
dont
normally
rate
beers
but
this
one
has
me
wanting
to
shout
reveries
of
its
awesomeness
from
a
mountain
please
try
this
beer
so
that
you
know
im
not
crazy
for
my
outlandish
description
o
yummy
rich
and
creamy
awesome
it
is
a
great
baltic
porter
that
fits
the
mold
not
too
boozy
not
too
sweet
o
by
far
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
i
have
ever
had
mouthfeel
and
flavor
are
the
highlights
of
this
beer
who
new
a
lager
could
taste
so
good
o
a
good
brew
for
a
cold
winters
day
o
a
delicious
and
very
worthy
example
of
the
style
while
i
did
praise
its
drinkable
nature
one
is
enough
in
a
sitting
id
buy
it
again
thats
for
damn
sure
really
tasty
stuff
i
love
the
interplay
of
roasted

flavors

appearance

notes
are

the
body
is

and
the
roast

is
good

a
straightup
porter
that
said
it
is
a
tad
thin
for
a
baltic
there
is
a
light
hint
of
dark

a

roasted

also
the

pokes
through

the

pours

the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
brown
that
borders
on
black

opaque
the
beer
has

that
demonstrates
its
funk

mixes
well
with
the
dark
chocolate
notes
that
also
have

taste

notes
the
funk
is
a
bit
tarty
and

that
might

tastes
the

a

porter
and
worth
getting
again
not
terrible
thats
really
where
it

thanks
to
treyliff

this
overall
a

sweeter
baltic

that
is
nice
to
sit
back
with
and

evening
a
rather

you
really
feel
this
baltic

exceptional

m
full

creamy
some

o
i
love
this
beer
i
would
say
it
is
one
of
my
top
2
i
have
tried
from
duck
rabbit
it
is
a
hot
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
the
complexity
of
it
is
fascinating
my
only
complaint
is
the
alcohol
is
not
well
disguised
easier
said
than
done
though
an
almost
perfect
beer
pours
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
low
carbonation
and
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
almost
all
dark
fruit
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
or
something
else
sweet
taste
is
more
dark
fruit
and
a
richness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
delicious
dark
cherry
notes
this
beer
is
exactly
why
i
love
duckrabbit
intense

duck

baltic
porter
pours
solid
black
with
just
a
hair
over
a
fingers
worth
of
mocha
foam
capping
the
beer
head
retention
is
alright
and
lacing
is
minimal
the
nose
features
aroma
of
cocoa
powder
and
black
licorice
and
while
the
former
is
dominant
the
latter
definitely
has
its
fair
say
as
well
the
dark
chocolate
that
leads
off
the
flavor
profile
is
exceedingly
smooth
i
actually
find
myself
wishing
there
was
just
a
little
bit
of
a
roasty
edge
to
it
the
star
anise
that
follows
is
joined
by
a
light
earthy
hop
presence
to
form
the
finish
the
body
is
surprisingly
not
heavy
for
a
big
porter
and
that
combined
with
the
lack
of
appreciable
alcohol
makes
this
one
impressively
drinkable
the
modest
understated
carbonation
just
completes
the
picture
baltic
porter
is
just
another
entry
in
a
very
solid
lineup
from
duck
rabbit
now
if
they
would
just
bottle
the
end
of
reason
overall
a
little
too
onedimensional
on
the
sweet
fruity
side
would
prefer
to
see
more
chocolate
and
other
flavors
adding
depth
and
balance
growler
fill
that
my
neighbor
let
chill
for
about
6
weeks
still
lots
of
action
when
we
cracked
it
very
nice
deep
brownlight
black
pour
with
generous
1
finger
mocca
head
smell
is
a
bit
tame
with
some
notes
of
coffee
carmel
roasted
malts
and
some
earth
tones
subtle
on
the
nose
taste
was
where
this
brew
hooked
me
a
very
balanced
porter
that
hides
the
9
quite
well
initial
coffee
and
chocolate
that
fades
to
earth
and
nuts
with
a
hint
of
hops
pretty
complex
and
smooth
comes
off
a
bit
more
like
a
stout
than
porter
feel
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
a
touch
watery
and
thin
it
did
have
a
silk
feel
on
the
tongue
and
perhaps
the
6
weeks
had
something
to
do
with
this
adequate
carbonation
but
a
little
light
on
the
feel
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
solid
blend
of
malts
coffee
chocolate
and
earth
well
hidden
abv
and
tough
to
set
down
a
nice
sipper
for
a
winter
evening
again
this
comes
off
as
a
stout
to
me
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
and
i
will
be
trying
one
out
of
the
bottle
soon
o
this
was
an
okay
baltic
porter
it
reminded
me
way
too
much
of
cherry
cough
syrup
though
more
then
anything
which
i
didnt
particularly
like
overall
interesting
to
try
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
baltic
porter
and
not
something
that
i
would
go
back
to
right
away
o
it
is
a
different
taste
experience
from
what
i
initially
expected
the
tart
cherry
taste
was
a
nice
surprise
you
would
never
know
that
this
is
a
9
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
wow
but
the
head
looks
more
like
a
stout
i
got
a
fingerandahalf
of
bubbling
deeptan
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
had
a
dried
darkfruit
scent
like
prunes
raisins
dried
blueberries
you
get
the
idea
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
alcohol
heat
was
the
first
thing
that
was
evident
on
the
tongue
getting
past
that
it
was
really
like
a
fruitcake
with
lots
of
dried
fruit
flavors
like
the
aforementioned
as
well
as
cherries
plus
a
nice
maltiness
finish
was
literally
breathtaking
as
the
alcohol
burn
really
led
the
way
followed
by
all
of
the
fruitiness
i
would
only
need
one
or
two
of
these
to
get
where
i
am
going
nicely
done
this
one
went
to
the
sink
there
were
some
good
things
up
front
but
the
dark
fruit
flavor
at
the
back
end
did
not
mesh
well
with
the
other
flavors
at
all
and
ruined
it
for
me
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
ill
need
to
try
a
fresh
one
for
comparison
but
this
drinks
like
a
light
russian
imperial
stout
many
of
those
same
dark
fruit
and
cocoa
flavors
but
with
a
smaller
body
and
still
pretty
high
alcohol
well
done
o
huh
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
almost
no
roasted
malt
just
tart
fruits
im
unsure
as
ive
never
had
this
before
some
of
the
descriptions
list
similar
aspects
though
so
i
really
cant
discount
this
odd
beer
and
not
that
tasty
medium
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
and
creamy
overall
feel
a
delicious
and
nuanced
brew
with
a
ton
of
flavor
one
of
the
very
best
of
the
style
overall
not
quite
to
my
taste
its
a
little
bit
different
but
its
lacking
in
the
roast
department
and
the
high
abv
comes
through
too
much
d
big
without
being
ris
big
and
the
abvflavor
certainly
could
play
with
the
riss
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
brew
from
duck
rabbit
as
it
can
be
a
little
more
difficult
to
find
than
some
of
there
other
offerings
an
easy
drinking
beer
reminiscent
of
a
brown
ale
i
want
to
start
and
say
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
duckrabbit
like
most
of
the
other
reviews
this
brew
is
true
to
style
and
all
the
flavor
notes
are
there
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
and
drinkable
than
lesser
baltic
porters
it
deserves
to
be
cherished
saying
youre
the
dark
beer
specialist
is
a
bold
statement
but
they
get
it
right
with
this
one
o
one
of
duckrabbits
best
creations
very
tasty
very
likeable
duck
rabbit
has
themselves
a
nice
example
of
the
style
here
the
flavors
solid
and
the
mouthfeel
is
out
of
this
world
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
to
light
level
of
carbonation
for
a
9
lager
this
is
fairly
well
tamed
yet
has
its
edges
about
it
that
are
bold
it
is
fairly
crisp
and
easily
approachable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
single
serving
at
a
time
this
is
a
fairly
decent
brew
that
is
worth
giving
a
try
at
least
once
o
duckrabbits
best
offering
and
just
as
good
ontap
strong
slightly
boozy
flavorful
and
a
great
pint
for
the
winter
o
to
be
honest
i
havent
tried
many
baltic
porters
in
my
life
that
i
havent
liked
however
id
rank
this
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
cost
8
99
for
a
six
pack
o
great
beer
with
good
complexity
and
after
reading
about
the
style
i
would
say
this
beer
is
spot
on
with
the
english
baltic
porter
recipe
nice
job
duck
rabbit
o
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
not
but
this
one
seemed
a
bit
funky
the
finish
is
quite
sour
which
i
wasnt
really
expecting
and
the
coffee
flavor
is
a
bit
overwhelming
o
wellmade
beer
but
unusual
deep
nutty
flavor
doesnt
fit
for
me
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
received
in
a
beer
of
the
month
6
pack
from
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
virginia
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
one
finger
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
heavily
of
dark
malt
which
is
quite
sweet
but
not
overly
so
tastes
of
very
dark
malt
and
slight
hops
very
well
balanced
carbonation
is
right
and
goes
down
extremely
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
am
surprised
about
how
good
it
is
as
i
am
normally
not
a
huge
fan
of
porter
o
i
like
this
beer
the
smokiness
works
really
well
i
would
certainly
order
it
again
o
i
have
always
loved
this
offering
from
duckrabbit
and
will
continue
to
i
feel
for
the
style
it
is
truly
one
of
the
best
it
has
a
abv
content
that
makes
me
curious
to
see
what
time
will
do
for
this
one
lovely
o
overall
very
enjoyable
not
terribly
complex
but
quite
taste
with
good
drinkability
and
deceivingly
strong
a
good
brew
for
sure
dark
and
deep
with
a
great
balanced
flavor
and
an
amazing
smell
great
job
very
very
good
porter
highly
recommended
this
is
a
good
beer
the
flavor
is
similar
to
an
irish
dry
stout
of
sorts
the
alcohol
takes
this
one
to
a
new
dimension
overall
its
a
sipper
but
its
enjoyable
ill
take
another
o
pretty
mild
for
a
9
abv
baltic
porter
the
flavors
mix
very
well
together
though
and
there
are
no
negative
flavors
present
a
decent
baltic
porter
overall
even
though
the
feel
on
this
doesnt
seem
to
match
the
taste
and
the
smell
especially
really
hits
it
out
of
the
park
9
abv
barely
even
hard
to
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
good
it
has
a
good
carbonation
level
and
full
bodied
smooth
mouthfeel
from
beginning
to
end
well
maybe
slightly
clean
and
dry
at
the
end
the
9
alcohol
is
not
one
youd
expect
from
the
mouthfeel
either
no
hot
bite
at
all
and
its
nice
and
drinkable
you
could
use
this
as
a
sipper
but
you
certainly
dont
need
to
great
representation
of
the
style
duckrabbit
made
it
worth
drive
of
about
1200
miles
worth
it
o
probably
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
and
darn
near
the
top
of
my
favorite
duckrabbit
list
d
its
a
spoton
baltic
porter
thats
vaguely
reminiscent
of
flossmoors
killer
kowalski
or
smuttynoses
offering
in
terms
of
sweetness
and
flavor
profile
not
as
smokey
or
brineheavy
as
scandinavian
takes
on
the
style
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
appreciate
that
this
comes
in
12oz
bottles
as
that
seems
like
the
appropriate
serving
size
i
think
more
would
become
fatiguing
and
burdensome
for
one
person
o
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
big
awesome
flavors
and
aromas
from
this
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
with
a
mouth
filling
full
carbonation
classic
baltic
porter
well
done
well
done
the
10
burnt
sugar
is
what
i
get
out
of
it
all
the
amazing
complexity
is
gone
leaving
a
subdued
caramel
dry
feeling
i
prefer
fresh
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
beer
of
this
proportion
at
9
i
would
have
liked
something
creamier
and
chewier
but
it
is
not
to
the
point
of
watery
it
could
just
use
a
little
more
body
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
that
i
can
get
easily
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
o
baltic
porters
are
becoming
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
easy
to
find
locally
fairly
complex
without
being
too
heavy
great
beer
o
this
beer
is
a
real
sipper
due
to
the
full
and
filling
body
in
addition
to
the
high
abv
there
are
some
nice
flavors
to
the
beer
but
it
did
not
have
the
vinous
acidity
that
i
really
like
in
the
style
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
one
a
bit
more
than
i
thought
i
wouldve
i
really
liked
the
big
chocolate
flavor
and
how
it
didnt
let
the
roast
or
smoke
dominate
wish
the
feel
wouldve
been
better
but
at
least
it
delivers
on
flavor
o
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
trade
for
it
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
o
i
think
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
love
blatic
porters
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
overall
as
expected
it
was
a
very
drinkable
baltic
porter
with
a
smooth
thick
body
and
moderate
sweetness
could
use
a
bit
of
age
since
grain
is
a
bit
aggressive
but
it
drinks
pretty
good
fresh
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
one
and
it
tastes
about
the
same
as
before
i
guess
im
not
a
huge
fan
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
thick
looking
black
body
the
head
on
top
is
a
brownish
tan
color
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
roasted
and
sweet
smelling
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
rich
with
bitter
flavors
and
and
sweet
caramel
flavors
too
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
pretty
thick
it
could
pass
as
a
stout
its
creamy
and
oily
feeling
with
an
easy
going
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
brew
i
would
buy
it
again
o
very
good
beer
glad
i
snagged
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
even
though
this
is
a
bit
heavy
for
a
normal
12oz
cannot
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
wish
this
stuff
was
more
obtainable
o
this
is
a
good
baltic
porter
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
its
just
a
little
sweet
and
heavy
on
the
chocolate
syrupy
flavor
i
still
like
it
but
its
not
a
world
beater
o
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
so
damn
good
in
every
sensory
aspect
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
actively
seek
it
out
again
this
was
received
as
an
extra
but
cant
for
the
life
of
me
remember
from
who
thank
you
to
whoever
it
was
this
is
excellent
the
only
thing
id
change
is
perhaps
a
bit
less
dark
fruit
flavor
and
a
bit
more
maltiness
and
roast
otherwise
excellent
4
5
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
roasted
wonderland
that
has
good
balance
and
is
blossoming
as
it
warms
pours
black
with
about
in
inch
of
dark
brown
head
very
appealing
smells
of
chocolate
vanilla
coffee
some
toasted
caramel
and
brown
sugar
tastes
of
sugar
vanilla
caramel
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
it
starts
off
sweet
but
finishes
with
some
of
the
more
roasty
notes
mouth
is
smooth
in
the
beginning
but
sugary
sticky
and
dry
on
the
finish
overall
a
great
porter
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
would
happily
drink
much
more
of
this
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
brown
glow
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
smells
chocolatey
and
roasty
tons
of
chocolatey
goodness
tastes
dry
and
chocolate
heavy
a
solid
roastiness
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
very
enjoyable
dry
but
thick
and
smooth
good
carbonation
too
dry
for
me
but
overall
very
nice
o
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
flavor
profile
only
thing
i
would
have
liked
was
for
it
to
be
a
bit
creamier
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
as
well
rabbit
on
the
label
wearing
a
snow
hat
poured
a
black
color
with
no
head
smells
like
soy
sauce
raisins
and
chocolate
with
alcohol
taste
is
a
bombardment
of
chocolate
malt
and
alcohol
this
is
sweet
and
salty
with
low
carbonation
slick
and
smooth
feel
best
beer
i
have
had
by
them
yet
the
cpj
o
love
love
love
medium
to
full
bodied
with
very
fine
and
soft
carbonation
to
contribute
to
a
nicely
creamy
beer
alcohol
is
well
hidden
behind
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
also
the
heat
has
died
pretty
much
all
the
way
leaving
this
open
to
get
mouth
raped
by
me
i
will
enjoy
doing
it
o
one
of
the
better
dr
offerings
i
have
had
good
depth
of
flavour
i
would
have
this
again
no
question
d
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
was
really
nice
sweetness
that
doesnt
get
out
of
control
thanks
to
the
burnt
malts
although
this
is
9
abv
i
could
drink
multiple
of
these
without
realizing
what
hit
me
delicious
beer
and
one
i
am
going
to
have
to
seek
out
again
o
this
was
a
great
beer
full
on
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
blew
through
the
first
four
in
the
six
pack
but
saving
two
for
later
in
the
year
highly
recommend
it
had
this
at
the
acbf
and
was
lucky
enough
to
get
one
as
an
extra
from
pittsburghkid66
excellent
beer
overall
nice
smooth
beer
the
balance
was
very
good
and
i
would
have
it
again
d
drinks
similar
to
an
ris
the
smooth
creaminess
makes
it
easy
to
drink
its
warm
and
delightful
perfect
for
a
cold
rainy
night
such
as
this
one
this
specialty
brew
is
a
solid
black
color
opaque
with
a
modest
light
tan
head
that
breaks
to
a
ring
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
meek
but
tasteful
chocolate
charcoal
with
a
nutty
undertone
the
flavor
brings
tart
brandy
malt
with
charcoal
smoke
it
mellows
nicely
with
great
balance
between
granny
apple
and
earthy
toffee
malt
very
nice
with
medium
plus
body
and
a
slightly
chalky
feel
with
pleasant
carbonation
an
excellent
unique
baltic
porter
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
a
bit
different
but
robust
and
great
to
drink
duck
rabbit
makes
its
way
to
the
knoxville
area
i
believe
i
hope
they
come
to
nashville
soon
because
i
will
be
buying
the
hell
out
of
their
baltic
porter
o
fantastic
brew
likely
among
my
favorite
baltic
porters
wish
the
carb
was
just
a
hare
lower
pours
a
big
one
and
a
half
finger
milk
chocolate
head
with
some
small
bubbles
and
some
big
bubbles
im
surprised
at
this
but
i
can
hear
the
head
fizzing
not
a
good
sign
usually
the
head
isnt
going
away
super
fast
but
its
for
sure
dissipating
the
body
is
absolutely
pitch
black
no
light
is
getting
through
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
lacing
is
excellent
it
just
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
overall
an
ok
look
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
mainly
the
head
was
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
but
the
body
looks
solid
nice
roasted
malt
on
the
nose
chocolate
is
also
present
for
sure
it
smells
slightly
sweet
slightly
bitter
i
also
detect
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
kick
underneath
the
initial
smell
it
smells
pretty
solid
it
smells
like
there
may
even
be
some
other
scents
in
here
that
i
cant
quite
identify
so
perhaps
more
complex
either
way
i
can
tell
its
going
to
be
a
quality
made
and
quality
tasting
beer
wow
the
taste
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
this
tastes
like
an
oatmeal
stout
to
me
oatmeal
is
very
present
its
also
very
sweet
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
the
malts
are
present
but
not
as
roasty
as
i
was
hoping
more
sweet
than
anything
there
is
a
little
bittersourness
on
the
flavor
its
a
good
brew
dont
get
me
wrong
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
and
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
hoped
a
little
one
sided
i
do
however
get
a
nice
taste
in
the
middle
of
the
drink
that
i
cant
quite
identify
maybe
dark
fruit
its
very
yummy
though
so
i
guess
its
a
little
complex
just
not
nearly
complex
as
i
would
like
they
do
a
very
nice
job
of
masking
that
9
though
i
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
i
mean
you
know
its
there
because
you
can
taste
the
sweetness
and
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
when
you
drink
it
but
its
not
an
offensive
alcohol
taste
i
keep
getting
this
taste
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
its
really
nice
its
like
a
cinnamon
candy
maybe
even
cake
taste
its
so
bazaar
because
its
so
subtle
i
can
barely
pick
up
on
it
but
its
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
decent
its
thin
in
some
areas
and
big
in
others
so
thats
a
little
disappointing
but
the
carbonation
is
just
right
drinkability
is
honestly
better
than
it
should
be
for
9
with
that
being
said
its
still
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
overall
its
a
good
beer
is
it
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
no
way
but
its
good
the
beer
all
around
is
too
sweet
but
it
has
some
nice
factors
and
i
really
liked
that
middle
flavor
i
kept
picking
up
on
o
overall
not
bad
the
flavor
profile
was
pretty
mild
and
uninteresting
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
like
to
get
more
of
it
along
with
their
milk
stout
to
try
side
by
side
oi
honestly
dont
like
this
beer
at
all
i
had
high
hopes
for
it
but
maybe
baltic
porters
just
arent
for
me
just
not
what
i
expected
overall
its
a
good
offering
from
duck
rabbit
a
different
porter
for
sure
a
bit
surprising
for
the
style
in
most
aspects
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
not
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
if
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
it
would
be
a
lot
more
enjoyable
but
the
acidic
feel
takes
away
from
the
taste
and
my
overall
opinion
of
the
beer
drinkable
but
not
quite
enjoyable
this
smells
and
tastes
distinctively
different
from
any
other
baltic
porter
ive
tried
though
i
have
a
hard
time
pinning
down
exactly
what
makes
it
unique
in
any
case
very
good
overall
and
it
inspires
me
to
hunt
down
and
try
some
other
duckrabbit
beers
12oz

of

pours
near
blackonly
some
red
hue
is
noticeable
when
held
up
to
the
lightwith
minimal
khaki
head
aroma
has
dark
chocolate
some
cherry
or
strawberry
and
some
light
coffee
taste
has
some
roasty
bitterness
but
it
is
beautifully
balanced
by
a
sweet
malt
backbone
the
bitter
and
sweet
go
back
and
forth
on
this
beer
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
finish
is
a
bit
dry
what
a
great
beer
it
doesnt
drink
like
9abv
either
o
overall
very
impressed
with
this
brew
would
definitely
seek
this
out
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
dont
have
a
bad
word
to
say
about
it
d
this
beer
seems
so
complex
there
are
lots
of
flavor
combining
together
and
its
tough
to
really
put
your
finger
on
them
all
but
they
are
very
good
and
well
balanced
dfor
an
out
of
the
bottle
offering
this
one
doesnt
miss
the
mark
of
what
this
one
can
bring
to
you
when
on
draft
an
excellent
offering
and
one
of
the
finest
domestic
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
is
big
beer
needs
to
be
sipped
it
also
helps
to
wait
a
minute
or
two
to
let
the
beer
warm
a
bit
to
get
all
the
flavors
notes
this
was
just
a
really
delicious
beer
ive
been
impressed
with
everything
ive
had
from
duckrabbit
fist
bump
notes
full
of
flavor
yet
with
an
elegant
moutfeel
a
nice
example
that
is
more
classic
than
a
lot
of
american
attempts
at
the
style
well
done
d
drinks
similar
to
an
ris
the
smooth
creaminess
makes
it
easy
to
drink
its
warm
and
delightful
perfect
for
a
cold
rainy
night
such
as
this
one
111th
all
in
all
this
one
surprised
me
best
brew
ive
had
from
dr
so
far
if
you
like
baltic
porters
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
and
deserves
a
try
if
you
like
dark
brews
in
general
id
recommend
trying
this
too
this
is
almost
like
a
yoohoo
nesquik
taste
bravo
duck
rabbit
d
i
didnt
like
this
when
i
first
had
it
but
im
coming
around
to
its
unique
approach
to
the
style
i
prefer
smuttynoses
baltic
porter
to
this
one
but
that
shouldnt
be
taken
as
a
strong
criticism
of
this
beer
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
a
hint
of
spice
to
the
background
the
smell
would
of
been
lovely
if
it
was
a
tad
stronger
i
felt
that
i
had
to
struggle
to
get
the
aroma
out
the
taste
was
of
a
very
sweet
malty
back
ground
with
a
hit
of
spice
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
which
i
feel
fits
this
style
appropriatly
even
though
it
is
a
baltic
porter
will
pick
up
again
during
the
winter
as
this
was
a
great
brew
to
have
get
it
served
from
tap
into
a
flared
pilsner
glass
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
around
the
edges
in
the
light
with
a
two
finger
dark
tan
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasty
malt
dark
fruit
cream
dark
chocolate
and
very
slight
alcohol
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
the
excellent
brew
if
im
honest
it
tasted
slightly
better
out
of
the
bottle
i
had
in
the
past
but
it
is
definitely
no
slouch
on
tap
the
dark
chocolate
aspect
was
just
more
robust
out
the
bottle
from
what
i
remember
definitely
a
great
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
throughout
this
beer
an
absolute
must
try
without
any
doubt
on
tap
at
pizza
paradiso
in
georgetownn
dc
in
line
with
several
other
delicious
portersstouts
ive
had
recently
velvety
smooth
its
a
beer
which
begs
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
roasted
flavors
chocolate
stand
out
very
little
hop
bite
delicious
drinkable
one
and
done
poured
this
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
southampton
snifter
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
light
making
its
way
though
on
the
edges
the
smell
is
roasty
and
a
little
sweet
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
mostly
roasted
malt
character
with
a
mild
hop
character
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
is
good
if
you
trade
with
somebody
from
someone
from
north
carolina
try
and
work
this
one
into
the
trade
if
you
like
dark
beers
anyone
that
im
doing
a
trade
with
make
a
note
send
me
some
of
this
rabbit
duck
stuff
very
impressive
for
the
first
try
of
a
brewery
and
even
on
a
style
thats
hit
or
miss
for
me
d
very
delicious
and
although
the
feel
could
be
better
its
not
a
fatal
flaw
yet
another
great
beer
from
the
darkbeer
mastersduck
rabbit
overall
definitely
one
of
the
best
baltic
porters
out
there
d
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
so
much
so
that
i
sought
it
out
in
this
trade
after
i
received
it
as
an
extra
in
a
previous
trade
its
very
drinkable
and
i
wish
i
was
able
to
get
it
here
in
california
this
is
one
of
the
best
regularly
available
beers
coming
out
of
the
southeast
duck
rabbit
does
great
things
and
baltic
porter
is
at
the
forefront
as
one
of
thier
top
achievements
d
this
one
get
ya
feelin
right
on
a
cold
night
all
the
stuff
i
look
for
in
a
baltic
porter
maybe
a
bit
sweeter
then
my
ideal
but
it
works
nicely
here
im
having
no
problem
drinking
this
glass
but
im
trying
to
savor
it
its
going
down
to
easy
d
the
beer
needs
to
be
sipped
given
its
high
alcohol
content
and
full
body
a
superior
winter
warmer
most
definitely
a
sipper
that
reveals
its
flavor
notes
as
the
beer
warms
nice
creamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
notes
are
heavy
on
licorice
with
some
coffee
i
also
detected
some
metallic
taste
but
that
seemed
to
go
away
as
the
beer
warmed
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
solid
example
of
the
style
d
not
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
here
some
really
weird
and
off
flavors
d
well
this
would
go
down
much
easier
if
the
body
was
a
bit
lighter
and
the
alcohol
was
more
deceptive
perhaps
at
78
abv
but
the
flavor
this
brew
packs
is
certainly
worth
being
full
after
one
or
two
bottles
verdict
quite
nice
im
tempted
to
make
this
one
a
winter
regular
as
it
does
a
good
job
at
finding
the
boldness
i
seek
in
a
porter
and
at
balancing
complementary
flavors
worth
it
should
you
find
a
place
that
carries
this
brewerys
selections
get
some
b
3

the
mouth
feel
is
thick
but
different
than
a
stout
drinkability
falls
on
how
you
feel
about
the
flavor
some
may
find
it
drinkable
others
not
so
much
its
a
big
boy
beer
thats
for
sure
kinda
like
left
hand
fade
to
black
on
steroids
my
ass
has
been
kicked
this
early
on
sunday
morning
it
challenged
me
on
many
levels
heres
where
ill
tip
my
hat
in
appreciation
of
a
fine
ale
and
say
good
day
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
one
that
i
have
enjoyed
in
the
past
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
definitely
recommend
taste
is
heavy
in
nutty
maltyness
and
a
strong
bit
of
smoke
just
a
tinge
of
sweetness
which
balances
the
beer
nicely
i
do
get
a
bit
of
a
hop
finish
medium
full
body
this
is
a
great
beer
to
be
paired
with
food
on
its
own
however
its
just
not
great
for
more
than
one
drink
the
drinkability
is
great
nice
beer
i
look
forward
to
each
year
overall
impression
a
great
baltic
porter
complex
layering
of
flavors
no
alcohol
taste
or
smell
considering
the
9abv
makes
it
appreciably
drinkable
the
thickness
and
complexity
may
slow
you
down
the
sweet
aftertaste
will
keep
you
going
d
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
its
strength
and
body
thickness
d
to
bad
i
only
have
one
oexceptional
beer
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
duck
rabbit
the
smokey
and
roasted
malts
are
balanced
perfectly
by
a
dark
fruitchocolate
sweetness
be
careful
though
those
abvs
will
creep
up
on
you
since
you
cannot
taste
them
in
the
beer
you
forget
its
strength
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
beer
out
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
nicely
creamy
very
smooth
somewhat
heavy
but
the
finish
is
a
little
harsh
for
me
and
as
a
result
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
than
it
would
be
otherwise
a
very
solid
offering
from
duck
rabbit
thanks
to
bucketboy
for
the
generous
extra
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
old
stock
snifter
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
quarter
inch
loose
mochacolored
head
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
head
quickly
disperses
towards
the
shoulders
before
dissipating
into
a
thin
band
around
the
edges
no
lacing
on
this
one
big
bold
nose
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
reminiscent
of
grape
juice
theres
also
a
slight
bubblegum
character
taste
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
suggested
by
the
nose
and
there
is
a
slightly
oxidized
character
and
some
acidity
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
prickly
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
definitely
a
solid
baltic
porter
but
doesnt
touch
my
go
to
bp
smuttynose
i
would
however
love
the
opportunity
to
try
this
on
tap
well
worth
your
time
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
but
i
would
not
recommend
cellaring
if
this
is
a
representative
sampling
quite
complex
ive
enjoyed
a
few
baltic
porters
this
year
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
a
nice
blend
of
vinousness
without
any
sourness
restrained
roast
and
sweet
dark
maltiness
other
than
the
high
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
d
a
really
interesting
mix
of
dark
beer
complexity
with
vinous
notes
that
i
have
only
recognized
in
sours
until
now
this
is
an
interesting
style
that
ill
be
on
the
look
out
for
in
the
future
the
body
is
full
and
carbonation
is
fine
in
structure
but
active
really
nice
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
would
be
nice
to
have
regular
access
to
d
warm
and
heavy
definitely
a
sipper
strong
alcohol
not
well
hidden
bottle
poured
into
my
ccb
tulip
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
what
starts
as
a
14
inch
dark
tan
head
that
quickly
settles
to
form
a
tan
collar
around
the
glass
the
first
aroma
i
smell
is
that
of
roasty
coffee
mixed
with
milky
chocolate
slight
tobacco
but
overall
a
very
mellow
smell
swirling
to
get
a
better
smell
creates
some
nice
lace
around
the
glass
the
alcohol
is
pretty
apparent
in
teh
first
sip
i
take
but
also
dark
fruits
roast
coffee
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
leather
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
and
pretty
creamy
slightly
dry
finish
nice
sipper
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
touch
of
warmth
light
acidity
going
down
but
a
pretty
nice
baltic
porter
thanks
russ
moderate
to
full
in
body
with
carbonation
at
the
same
level
too
many
bubbles
for
a
dry
beer
that
isnt
too
thick
more
acidic
and
less
malt
dominated
and
thick
than
a
typical
baltic
porter
a
more
historic
variation
on
the
style
unique
dry
and
acidic
qualities
make
it
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
pour
brings
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
pretty
complex
with
some
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
tad
bit
of
booze
the
taste
is
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
as
well
as
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
roast
good
feel
with
a
tad
bit
of
booze
good
beer
all
around
and
a
solid
offering
from
them
this
is
a
great
little
baltic
porter
d
a
little
too
sweet
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
id
prefer
a
little
less
sweetness
and
a
little
more
bitterness
the
balance
isnt
the
best
d
only
a
couple
before
moving
on
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
via
trade
there
is
alot
going
on
here
and
i
would
like
to
revisit
baltic
porters
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
will
probably
not
be
seeking
this
out
again
id
suggest
it
to
others
in
hopes
they
dont
have
this
possible
defect
in
their
taste
buds
creamy
feels
great
and
almost
all
the
other
flavors
are
great
fix
the
alcohol
and
you
have
a
nigh
on
perfect
beer
drinkability
its
only
moderate
due
to
the
weight
and
abv
i
may
be
able
to
see
past
this
just
a
little
bit
too
if
it
wasnt
for
that
slight
offscent
and
flavor
of
the
butter
but
its
still
really
good
and
i
would
love
to
have
some
more
one
per
sitting
would
suffice
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
color
to
the
point
that
unless
held
directly
to
light
it
has
the
appearance
of
black
the
tan
foam
on
the
surface
is
fading
but
at
a
moderate
rate
the
aroma
is
of
some
nice
smoked
malts
and
coffee
dark
chocolate
notes
are
also
prominent
due
to
the
higher
abv
a
sweet
alcohol
aroma
can
be
smelled
as
well
it
gives
a
honey
whiskey
aroma
to
the
mix
the
taste
is
both
a
bit
boozy
and
smokey
both
of
those
flavors
in
balance
really
make
up
the
brew
the
coffee
essence
is
mild
this
beer
is
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
would
have
assumed
the
baltic
porter
would
be
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
all
over
the
place
its
not
nearly
as
thick
as
it
seems
to
have
poured
and
i
feel
that
it
could
be
carbonated
a
little
bit
more
but
overall
its
not
that
bad
the
overt
sweetness
in
comparison
to
the
smoke
is
not
as
in
balance
as
i
would
like
this
however
is
a
rather
nice
brew

d
drs
ris
disappointed
me
in
how
harsh
it
was
this
could
very
well
be
an
ris
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
really
good
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
make
this
one
good
enough
to
come
back
to
again
and
again
i
wish
i
had
another
one
a
sweet
example
of
the
style
but
a
decent
one
bottle
pours
black
with
a
beige
head
nose
is
sweet
some
powdered
chocolate
vanilla
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
of
course
chocolate
some
mild
coffee
and
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
sour
component
that
clashes
horribly
with
the
bitter
coffee
and
light
malt
i
do
not
get
this
style
editi
like
to
read
other
reviews
after
posting
my
own
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
most
likely
got
a
bad
batch
after
reading
what
everyone
else
experienced
i
will
keep
my
post
as
is
but
something
may
have
gone
wrong
with
this
batch
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
about
one
inch
of
khakicolored
fluffy
head
smells
very
boozy
right
off
the
bat
cinnamon
and
other
sugarysweet
aromas
as
well
sweet
dark
fruit
character
gives
way
to
bitterroasty
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
that
finishes
dry
very
soft
carbonation
but
a
full
chewy
body
alcohol
warms
the
chest
drinkability
is
good
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
in
there
but
it
isnt
overpowering
great
for
a
cool
night
overall
this
is
a
well
done
baltic
porter
my
only
gripe
is
the
sweet
fruity
off
flavor
on
the
finish
but
beyond
that
there
isnt
much
to
complain
about
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
checking
out
i
need
to
get
myself
more
of
this
duck
rabbit
did
well
with
this
porter
keeping
with
their
dark
beer
experts
tag
line
even
at
9
this
thing
drinks
very
easily
i
could
pour
another
one
of
these
right
now
but
ill
use
some
restraint
and
save
it
for
another
day
this
is
a
great
beer
had
at
hosers
drunk
by
noon
sunday
british
open
tasting
thanks
presario
for
bringing
this
gem
i
hadnt
heard
of
this
beer
or
brewery
for
that
matter
and
feel
like
ive
been
missing
out
drink
this
if
you
get
the
chance
d
12156pk
of
this
extremely
enjoyable
brew
of
a
style
that
doesnt
have
a
big
representation
in
the
market
duckrabbit
has
a
longterm
customer
for
this
one
ill
pick
it
up
every
time
i
see
it
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
mildly
smokey
forward
a
little
sweet
and
the
back
is
bitter
with
grains
and
roast
the
smoke
character
is
minimal
but
its
really
good
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
drinkability
high
d
this
is
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
and
yet
another
great
dark
beer
from
the
brewers
of
duckrabbit
that
duckrabbit
looks
kinda
funny
in
a
winter
hat
tee
hee
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
the
slimmest
translucence
possible
topped
by
a
short
tan
foamy
head
the
nose
comprises
molasses
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
cinnamon
nutmeg
spruce
tips
roasted
malts
plums
and
a
bit
o
chocolate
the
taste
follows
very
closely
though
the
plums
and
spruce
tips
are
swallowed
alive
by
the
brown
sugar
and
molasses
midstroke
still
the
spiciness
mixes
well
with
the
syrups
and
roasted
malts
which
is
what
youre
lookin
fer
in
a
baltic
porter
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
heavymoderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
chewy
feel
overall
a
solid
baltic
i
expected
nothing
less
from
the
dr
d
were
it
not
for
the
big
beer
nature
of
this
beast
it
would
beckon
for
for
another
sip
and
another
and
another
eventually
though
its
just
too
rich
for
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
sitting
this
is
not
a
difficult
beer
but
hard
to
rate
its
drinkability
so
many
good
things
going
on
but
each
element
has
so
much
power
to
it
that
they
kinda
clash
wrestle
with
each
other
most
of
the
time
could
maybe
stand
some
aging
it
was
on
the
hot
side
when
i
tried
it
boozewise
still
very
good
overall
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
carbonation
a
nice
lagered
baltic
porter
would
purchase
by
the
six
pack
if
it
was
available
in
the
area
flavor
is
good
malty
thicker
than
expected
big
cocoa
and
coffee
notes
throughout
medium
mouthfeel
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
slightly
warming
but
booze
flavor
is
masked
pretty
well
an
easy
drinker
to
boot
a
great
porter
d
well
i
much
prefer
the
rabid
duck
to
this
as
it
is
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
would
have
loved
to
see
the
specialty
grains
balance
this
out
a
little
bit
edit
had
a
chance
to
try
it
again
recently
and
it
was
much
tastier
than
i
remembered
d
i
was
pleased
this
is
a
decent
baltic
porter
a
bit
sweeter
than
some
but
very
drinkable
and
one
i
would
be
happy
to
try
again
i
like
the
complexity
since
it
comes
off
as
more
ale
than
lagerlike
but
still
smooth
and
not
overly
boozy
either
d
dangerously
smooth
at
9
full
flavored
but
well
balanced
an
interesting
porter
in
a
good
way
yum
thanks
to
a
generous
trader
whose
identity
i
have
now
forgotten
for
this
tasty
extra
pours
oily
dark
brown
without
a
great
deal
of
head
but
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
glass
assuages
any
concern
with
carbonation
smells
of
lots
of
milk
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
port
interesting
mix
flavor
follows
with
a
little
more
emphasis
on
the
fruit
than
chocolate
but
theyre
both
still
quite
prominent
a
dash
of
toffee
floats
around
on
the
palate
as
well
along
with
brown
sugar
and
molasses
body
is
mediumthick
with
moderate
carbonation
ill
have
no
difficulty
downing
this
12
ounce
bottle
but
ones
enough
for
a
session
very
dark
pour
but
a
translucent
body
reveals
the
thinish
body
within
it
breathes
firewater
touches
of
smoke
a
roastiness
and
chocolate
astringency
there
is
a
sweetness
in
the
front
of
every
swallow
that
submerges
beneath
the
roast
and
chocolate
with
the
thin
veneer
of
smoke
clouding
all
from
above
the
body
is
thin
like
the
women
from
the
tv
lust
crowds
my
head
for
my
mouth
is
filled
with
good
cheer
maybe
ill
try
it
again
next
time
im
there
and
try
to
think
of
it
more
as
a
holiday
beer
and
see
if
i
like
it
a
little
better
overall
a
tasty
brew
i
need
to
try
some
more
of
their
stuff
just
too
syrupy
sweet
and
thick
for
me
i
havent
had
too
many
baltic
porters
so
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
style
on
the
positive
side
the
labeling
is
cool
wow
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
so
much
now
that
i
have
tried
it
i
intend
to
buy
more
in
the
future
fantastic
showing
duckrabbit
i
will
be
paying
closer
attention
now
hv
d
not
a
huge
fan
at
the
beginning
but
this
beer
grew
on
me
at
the
end
i
was
sold
on
it
duck
rabbit
pulls
out
another
dark
beer
that
is
great
d
not
sessionable
sip
and
savor
really
drinkable
beer
for
being
9
the
flavors
are
very
rich
and
enjoyable
without
being
unbalanced
or
harsh
excellent
baltic
porter
mouthfeel
is
good
but
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
creeping
sourness
and
port
notes
that
just
dont
work
with
the
underlying
flavor
profile
this
one
is
very
unique
and
i
could
see
how
certain
individuals
may
find
it
very
appealing
so
i
would
advise
seeking
it
out
for
yourself
and
seeing
if
it
is
for
you
d
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
though
one
is
plenty
for
me
on
any
given
occasion
close
to
a
finger
of
dark
brown
foam
thick
yet
only
moderate

much
hoppiness
but
there
is
a
sudden
lift
before
it
all
disappears
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
coils
and
leaps
through
the
mouth
to
relieve
any
unwanted
weight
or
pressure

clean
up

lets
you
choose
how
long
it
sticks

notes
hmmm
i
think
this
is
my
first
go
at
duckrabbt
having
overheard
often
that
it
is
typically
hit
or
miss
with
them
this
one
is
surely
on
the
hit
column
very
nice
but
extremely
drinkable
high
gravity
beer
deep
rich
mahogany
color
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
roasted
barley
substantial
body
with
strong
dark
malt
character
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
present
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
with
no
light
passing
through
the
beer
the
burnt
taste
seems
to
overpower
the
rest
of
the
flavors
i
could
imagine
making
this
beer
into
some
kind
of
milkshake
feels
like
i
am
having
some
kind
of
decadent
chocolate
dessert
of
some
sort
with
about
18
months
on
it
this
is
even
better
smells
something
like
malted
milk
more
smooth
creamy
and
mellow
delish
dthis
is
so
drinkable
big
bold
flavors
with
a
nice
complexity
and
a
hint
of
balance
very
sweet
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
moderate
to
low
carbonation
i
usually
enjoy
drs
darker
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
very
good
drinking
and
tasty
baltic
porter
for
a
cold
winter
night
it
might
not
be
the
prettiest
or
the
best
smelling
but
it
is
thick
and
delicious
which
matter
most
to
me
for
the
style
the
pours
is
deep
and
dark
similar
to
any
good
imperial
stout
i
try
to
identify
any
hint
of
color
but
it
is
as
black
as
can
be
the
thin
head
that
sits
on
top
is
a
medium
chocolate
brown
like
the
foam
on
top
of
a
vigorously
poured
glass
of
chocolate
milk
the
aroma
is
unremarkable
with
just
a
bit
of
crisp
sweetness
and
just
the
slightest
touch
of
booze
where
this
one
stands
out
is
in
the
flavor
and
texture
richly
sweet
with
flavors
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
molasses
and
an
underlying
bitterness
akin
to
a
lightly
roasted
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
if
it
were
any
sweeter
it
would
almost
seem
syrupy
with
how
little
carbonation
it
has
but
the
smoothness
works
with
the
flavor
to
create
a
rich
decadent
but
smooth
drinking
experience
2009
bottles
fresh
is
best
with
duckrabbit
dont
worry
about
aging
no
sourness
when
fresh
last
bottle
im
having
here
in
early
february
is
picking
up
a
tartness
in
the
taste
there
is
also
some
consistency
issues
with
this
beer
ive
had
a
few
over
the
years
that
were
off
even
beyond
the
sourness
it
picks
up
over
time
as
well
as
one
that
was
completely
flat
and
not
very
good
at
all
guessing
it
wasnt
capped
properly
this
loses
a
lot
of
its
luster
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
overall
incredibly
flavorful
and
packs
quite
a
punch
feels
like
11
but
i
think
its
a
little
overrated
i
do
prefer
sinebrychoff
porter
but
this
is
also
an
excellent
example
of
a
baltic
porter
and
one
i
will
enjoy
each
year
it
comes
out
poured
a
very
deep
brown
with
good
carbonation
and
a
tan
head
nose
is
chocolate
roasted
and
coffee
taste
is
oh
so
smooth
milk
chocolate
coffee
booze
and
roasted
malts
oats
perhaps
mouthfeel
is
smooth
coating
and
sweet
with
cocoa
drinkability
is
very
very
good
i
think
i
like
the
aged
one
a
little
better
than
the
fresh
because
the
the
malts
havent
really
worked
in
yet
in
the
fresh
one
also
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
creamy
with
the
fresh
one
d
first
time
i
have
reviewed
any
of
their
beers
but
i
have
had
a
few
and
have
always
enjoyed
them
really
great
baltic
porter
thanks
again
d
i
would
actually
love
to
have
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
to
rereview
this
seeing
as
this
is
an
08
i
now
notice
it
is
notched
best
before
1109
this
is
very
bitter
and
not
many
tastes
compliment
the
bitterness
and
booziness
here
i
really
want
to
get
another
couple
and
age
them
and
see
how
that
goes
in
about
6
months
and
a
year
to
see
how
the
flavors
meld
drinkability
is
with
ease
it
is
strange
its
warm
without
doubt
and
while
i
know
alcohol
to
be
warming
i
dont
think
the
alcohol
is
obvious
a
quirky
beer
no
less
fun
to
experience
but
one
is
enough
well
happily
surprised
to
report
this
is
an
excellent
beer
no
knock
on
duckrabbit
but
baltic
porters
havent
been
in
my
sweet
spot
this
is
one
fine
brew
recommended
any
time
of
the
year
o
i
have
to
find
this
again
i
dont
think
this
could
be
improved
upon
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
the
9
limits
its
sessionabilty
but
this
beer
offers
a
lot
of
flavor
and
complexity
very
interesting
and
i
will
definitely
seek
out
other
baltic
porters
as
i
want
to
see
how
other
brewers
incoroporate
the
tangy
sour
aspects
associated
with
this
classic
porter
style
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
great
drinking
beer
very
smooth
and
nearly
decadent
on
the
palate
deliciously
drinkable
for
the
reported
abv
another
beer
id
like
to
have
available
more
often
i
would
imagine
i
could
use
this
one
in
a
dessert
of
some
sort
too
maybe
even
reduce
it
in
some
time
of
sauce
really
wish
i
had
more
thanks
again
wil
i
guess
ill
have
to
bug
you
for
some
more
soon
overall
this
is
one
huge
baltic
porter
it
is
a
little
hot
for
me
but
other
than
that
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
fairly
drinkable
considering
the
abv
but
would
be
a
lot
better
if
the
heat
wouldnt
show
so
much
i
wonder
if
this
would
do
well
with
some
years
on
it
rich
and
sweet
roasty
and
chocolatey
taste
a
little
sticky
creamy
but
astringent
in
the
first
sips
though
it
mellows
as
it
warms
pleasant
aftertaste
with
roast
malt
plumraisin
and
chocolate
milk
traces
a
well
balanced
and
flavorful
porter
great
for
the
cool
winter
months
awesome
but
dont
want
to
drink
more
than
1
a
night
this
thing
is
so
big
glad
i
got
a
case
from
my
parents
for
christmas
this
year
to
share
with
everyone
every
time
i
have
a
duck
rabbit
it
reminds
me
of
being
back
home
in
nc
grab
some
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
very
impressive
and
i
would
probably
like
it
for
that
alone
overall
a
pretty
good
baltic
porter
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
not
a
baltic
porter
to
me
more
like
a
smoked
porter
to
be
a
true
bp
should
be
a
lot
sweeter
overall
the
sweetness
damages
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
the
flavor
profile
is
still
a
revelation
the
same
could
be
said
about
a
lot
of
southern
food
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
distinctly
regional
concoction
that
is
superior
to
a
lot
of
the
originators
of
the
style
really
impressive
i
hope
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
someday
pours
very
dark
with
a
large
tan
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
unusual
in
that
the
dominant
aroma
was
the
acidity
i
thought
we
might
be
onto
something
with
this
beer
the
dark
malt
lends
hints
of
chocolate
and
some
smoke
unfortunately
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
aroma
seems
to
be
a
very
middle
of
the
road
porter
with
a
high
abv
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
rememberable
is
the
slight
acidity
in
the
finish
the
malt
just
does
not
seem
to
be
there
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
and
smoke
but
i
want
much
more
especially
with
this
abv
the
body
is
just
better
than
average
and
that
is
saved
by
the
nice
carbonation
just
seems
a
very
average
baltic
porter
it
definately
would
not
offend
anyone
d
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
which
could
be
cause
for
concern
with
abv
d
much
respect
for
duckrabbit
but
i
was
a
bit
cautious
coming
into
it
because
of
previous
experiences
with
the
style
not
anymore
downright
delicious
never
seen
it
in
bottles
anywhere
around
here
but
would
definitely
pick
up
some
more
pours
midnight

this
is
one
awesome
looking
beer
the
head
just
doesnt

around
for

the
rest
of
the
beer
is
as
good
as
it

it

first
couple
of
whiffs
reveal
some
dark
chocolates
nice
dark
roasty
malts
theres
some
nice
sweet
dark
fruitiness
as
well
with
a
slight
alcohol
presence
no
hops
to
speak
of
but
this
one
is
all
about
the
malts
first
few
sips
reveal
a
nice
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
hints
of
raisin
and
maybe
some
grape
as
well
along
with
some
nice
dark
chocolates
theres
a
nice
roastiness
lying
in
the
background
feels
so
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
perfect
carbonation
this
one
goes
down
nice
smooth
and
easy
perfect
for
sipping
on
a
cold
winter
nights
a
total
comfort
beer
and
duckrabbits
best
maybe
so
certainly
a
musttry
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
of
dark
beers
of
beer
in
general
of
putting
things
in
your
mouth
that
taste
amazing
of
living
the
good
life
or
of
um
about
anything
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
duck

at

served
in
a
standard
pintglass
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
nice
frothy
dark

that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
dark
malts
with
slight
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
very
enjoyable
amount
of
dark
malts
and
lingering
bitter
cocoa
flavor
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
alcohol
presence
while
this
one
has
shown
to
get
better
with
age
its
very
enjoyable
fresh
as
well
the
mouth
is
very
creamy
nice
thick
slightly
chewy
body
alcohol
presence
makes
itself
know
right
away
in
the
flavor
slight
astringent
zip
there
but
this
dissipates
flavors
of
syrupy
pancakes
pumpernickel
bread
dark
chocolate
and
even
a
touch
of
cold
coffee
in
there
this
has
been
one
of
the
more
elusive
dr
offerings
for
me
as
i
see
to
keep
missing
its
release
not
this
year
this
is
really
good
definitely
one
of
their
best
beers
recommend
a
very
respectable
baltic
porter
to
say
the
least
im
very
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
experiment
with
this
beer
and
my
first
beer
from
duckrabbit
gets
a
thumbs
up
d
almost
4

of
age
this
beer
still
has
a
nice

of

of
rich
dark
chocolate
toasty
and

notes
pretty
much
parallels
the
nose
with
a
bit
more
toasty
and
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
full
with
a
thick
listen
to
them
this
beer
tells
a
story
from
start
to
finish
and
feels
like
it
could
literally
slow
down
time
i
couldnt
think
of
a
better

to
pair
this
on
a

wanted
to
like
this
btw
thanks
jcdiflorio
for
a
nice
taste
of
this
rare
brew
aromatics
come
correct
with
the
malt
sweetness
and
roasty
qualities
associated
with
a
porter
upfront
with
the
plum
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
the
taste
is
heavy
on
roasted
grain
and
bitter
chocolate
secondary
in
the
flavor
profile
are
tastes
of
coffee
and
very
smooth
rich
and
mouthcoating
with
an
oily
bittersweet
chocolate
is
noticeable
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
quite
smooth
theres
a
moderate
about
of
carbonation
to
tingle
the
tongue
as
well
initially
the
flavor
is
that
of
dark
chocolate
the
alcohol
provides
a
warming
sensation
on
the
way
down
the
alcohol
is
well
played
in
this
one
it
is
not
overbearing
nor
unpleasant

the
beer
warms

all
in

absolutely
no

great
beer
and
big
thanks
to
my
buddy
paul
m
really
good
and
robust
flavors
they
try
to
complement
each
other
but
end
up
clashing
a
bit
still
delightful
to
drink
though
o
a
nice
baltic
porter
fruity
funky
yeasty
and
flavorful
not
quite
as
much
coffee
as
id
like
but
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
m
about
an
average
carb
level
the
flavor
definitely
fills
your
mouth
o
very
different
than
most
porters
i
have
experienced
fruitier
and
richer
the
richness
of
this
beer
can
not
be
overstated
overall
enjoyable
but
not
mind
blowing
oa
vast
improvement
over
other
beers
in
the
series
the
high
alcohol
isnt
entirely
noticeable
i
pulled
this
guy
out
of
my
cellar
because
i
noticed
the
cap
was
crimped
oddly
probably
meant
nothing
but
to
be
on
the
safe
side
better
drink
it
asap
harpoon
baltic
porter
pours
black
with
a
tiny
bonewhite

the
aroma
is
robust
with
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruits
taking
the
forefront
the
roasted
malts
border
on
burnt
the
first
sip
is
smoother
than
expected
with
a
very
nicely
rounded
body
the
dark
fruits
come
though
stronger
along
with
a
smooth
chocolate
flavor
that
tempers
the
roast
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
velvety
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
good
baltic
porter
especially
for
how
cheap
the
leviathan
series
is
highly
recommended
o
a
very
warming
beer
with
a
rich
flavor
and
ample
strength
to
warm
the
soul
and
please
the
palate
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
nicest
well
produced
beers
in
the
leviathan
series
i
have
tasted
so
far
it
really
can
call
for
a
second
or
third
round
and
still
be
interesting
and
fulfilling
slightly
sweet

some

slightly

easy

nice

robust

crisp
nice
all
around
brew
worth
it
get
one
especially
for
the
price
o
after
a
light
aroma
i
was
worried
about
this
however
the
flavor
profiles
is
fantastic
its
a
ton
of
flavors
packed
into
this
beer
all
mix
together
well
extremely
tasty
brew
here
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
more
would
love
to
get
this
on
tap
harpoons
baltic
porter
pours
jet
black
with
two
fingers
of
foam
that
manage
to
rise
up
enough
to
spill
out
of
my
glass
head
retention
is
good
and
the
lacing
left
behind
coats
the
glass
so
thoroughly
that
at
first
glance
i
couldnt
tell
if
it
was
lacing
or
if
the
head
just
hadnt
receded
the
nose
features
roasty
dark
chocolate
heavily
with
a
little
bit
of
a
biscuit
character
also
appreciable
the
flavor
adds
in
a
bit
of
raisin
sweetness
at
the
open
which
plays
nicely
off
the
bittersweet
chocolate
that
comes
in
for
the
second
half
of
each
sip
the
body
is
a
little
more
chewy
than
i
usually
find
in
a
baltic
porter
but
its
not
bad
especially
given
that
its
matched
with
a
carbonation
that
has
just
a
bit
more
kick
to
it
as
well
overall
harpoon
balic
porter
is
a
solid
entry
in
the
leviathan
series
its
not
a
beer
id
actively
seek
out
but
i
wouldnt
mind
finding
it
in
my
glass
again
either
o
a
solid
baltic
porter
with
a
nice
bit
of
complexity
and
warmth
a
good
sipper
for
the
cold
winter
nights
ahead
well
i
love
baltic
porters
and
ive
been
looking
for
this
one
for
years
very
excited
to
see
it
come
in
my
store
last
month
pretty
good
but
still
a
little
disappointing
particularly
the
odd
grainy
aroma
that
doesnt
match
the
flavor
at
all
o
while
baltic
porter
did
not
come
out
swinging
but
the
tasting
i
found
i
stumbled
on
an
awesome
brew
excellent
properties
between
the
sweet
flavors
and
bitter
finish
made
for
an
excellent
treat
highly
recommended
and
ill
be
looking
for
a
four
pack
of
this
great
job
harpoon
overall
it
was
worth
the
4
dollar
price
tag
these
beers
always
impress
me
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
stout
or
porter
lover
o
decent
baltic
porter
nice
and
creamy
with
decent
roasted
malt
aspects
smoky
for
the
style
which
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
but
its
not
overpowering
at
least
decent
o
nice
beer
coming
from
harpoon
o
this
is
a
great
baltic
porter
dry
citrusy
cocoa

charred

i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
the
2012
four
pack
edition
poured
into
a
harpoon
100
barrel
stemmed
glass
nice
surge
of
carbonation
on
the
side
of
the
glass
forms
a
nice
brown
head
atop
a
dark
brown
body
moderate
lacing
noticed
smell
was
metallic
very
reminiscent
of
the
oyster
stout
they
made
a
while
back
taste
was
good
i
liked
the
flavors
of
rum
molasses
raisins
and
chocolate
it
had
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
but
could
have
been
a
real
winner
if
it
was
a
bit
thicker
not
bad
but
not
an
all
star
i
have
another
4
pack
in
the
basement
to
age
to
see
what
6
months
or
1
year
does
to
this
beer
o
im
kind
of
surprised
by
the
high
ratings
for
this
beer
it
seems
like
one
of
those
beers
that
could
have
better
than
it
was
feel
full
body
with
low
carbonation
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
because
its
a
little
lighter
in
body
and
you
cant
taste
any
of
the
alcohol
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
nice
nose
on
this
dark
chocolate
and
fruit
give
a
pleasant
balanced
sweetness
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
flavor
offers
a
nice
chocolate
character
and
a
touch
of
roast
dark
fruits
especially
raisins
and
plums
and
a
touch
of
spice
just
a
touch
of
roast
to
give
some
bitterness
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
full
of
rich
roasted
flavors
and
a
good
bitter
dark
finish
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
bad
but
it
could
have
been
just
a
little
thicker
i
think
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
baltic
but
there
are
better
out
there
d
pretty
high
for
a
boozy
beer
but
at
10
a
4
pack
something
youll
want
to
savor
more
4
overall
i
rate
this
beer
a
wild
success
as
it
seems
to
me
that
it
combines
the
best
of
not
only
porters
but
perhaps
barleywines
as
well
with
a
little
port
wine
thrown
in
for
good
measure
definitely
worth
trying
a
fairly
typical
baltic
porter
not
bad
just
not
anything
to
really
distinguish
it
from
a
myriad
of
others
pours
black
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
roasty
but
with
some
style
typical
fruit
as
well
prunes
and
sultanas
notes
of
licorice
give
it
some
depth
and
i
think
i
taste
some
cola
notes
lurking
there
as
well
the
fruitiness
carries
through
in
the
taste
so
in
that
sense
we
have
a
true
baltic
style
porter
here
in
the
mouth
its
smooth
a
bit
thick
and
creamy
definitely
decent
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
has
that
fruity
bubblegummy
ester
feel
that
i
feel
the
leviathan
series
has
in
general
not
a
fan
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
a
bit
strong
so
a
bit
of
a
sipping
beer
but
every
sip
is
really
enjoyable
the
oak
flavors
are
present
and
really
nice
on
top
of
the
porter
elements
o
i
like
it
but
i
wish
they
didnt
do
this
whole
hanky
panky
4
pack
nonsense
anymore
i
guess
it
started
with
dogfishhead
and
im
rarely
critical
of
dfh
but
look
i
want
6
beers
i
dont
want
to
buy
my
beer
in
4s
i
feel
like
it
makes
me
a
communist
at
best
it
makes
me
look
like
a
snob
when
i
walk
up
to
the
counter
and
it
doesnt
feel
right
holding
a
4
pack
and
a
6
pack
it
just
doesnt
balance
out

recedes

fair

blackberry

an
odd

a
slight

the
absence
of

likely
due

inherent

not
too
bad
up
to
here
but
it
gets
more
complicated
in
mouth
disturbing
higher
alcohol
bordering
phenolic
notes
are
an
annoyance
so
is
the
burnt
wet

astringency
that
lives
on
after
each
sip
the
vinous
tartish
fruitiness
could
have
been
interesting
were
it
not
for
its
messy
neighbors
d
highly
drinkable
porter
the
age
didnt
hurt
this
a
bit
i
like
it
my
favorite
of
the
leviathan
series
d
really
amazing
it
gets
heavy
after
a
few
bottles
so
take
your
time
d
an
enjoyable
beer
with
a
nice
balance
to
it
pours
a
mostlyopaque
reddishbrown
with
minimal
creamcolored
head
solid
lacing
at
first
which
dissolves
to
loose
swiss
cheese
as
you
drink
smell
is
surprisingly
dominated
by
dark
fruit
particularly
prunes
and
black
cherry
much
different
than
the
left
hand
fade
to
black
baltic
porter
i
was
sipping
an
hour
or
two
before
taste
follows
suit
with
a
lot
of
pungent
sweetness
more
akin
to
the
great
divide
smoked
baltic
porter
than
the
left
hand
fade
to
black
the
sweetness
is
dark
fruit
based
as
per
the
smell
with
strong
licorice
notes
a
full
body
and
a
little
less
alcohol
heat
than
i
expected
though
there
is
certainly
some
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
bitterness
is
low
while
this
boasts
a
complex
flavor
profile
and
is
by
no
means
a
mediocre
brew
it
is
not
really
my
kind
of
porter
personally
it
is
too
sweet
with
a
medicinal
twang
leaving
me
feeling
as
if
i
were
drinking
some
kind
of
bizarre
fermented
prune
juice
b
yet
another
great
brew
from
the
leviathan
series
i
personally
have
never
been
a
fan
of
porters
but
this
is
one
of
the
few
exceptions
in
my
book
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
fluffy
tanish
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
as
is
expected
with
the
series
it
has
a
very
high
alcohol
content
that
does
so
through
in
the
flavors
a
bit
but
is
by
no
means
overpowering
because
of
its
strong
flavors
that
accompany
a
good
porter
it
does
not
have
the
greatest
drinkability
but
is
still
quite
a
tasty
beer
poured
awhile
back
at
bocktown
served
a
bit
too
cold
but
i
did
let
it
warm
up
to
open
it
up
a
bit

that
absolutely

a

very

herbal

for
balance
this
beer
just
works
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
evenly
carbonated
big
brash
but
full
of
finesse
this
is
well
planned
out
and
excecuted
nice
to
see
the
levithan
series
ruling
in
both
quality
and
consistency
a
great
brew
that
i
will
reach
for
the
next
time
i
see
it
around
i
will
throw
a
couple
in
the
cellar
with
my
triticus
and
bigfoots
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
finishes
really
dry
forward
its
a
little
sweet
and
it
finishes
ok
there
is
some
alcohol
in
the
forward
palate
and
some
bitterness
at
the
back
its
ok
ive
had
better
baltic
porters
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
that
is
almost
entirely
opaque
unless
its
held
up
to
the
light
pretty
good
tan
head
with
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
some
small
amount
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
roast
and
chocolate
for
the
most
part
with
some
light
caramel
and
date
flavors
good
full
body
not
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
had
but
quite
nice
overall
a
good
beer
maybe
just
a
little
too
extreme
d
strong
flavored
but
not
overpowering
with
the
lighter
body
making
for
an
easier
drinking
beer
it
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
prickly
carbonation
this
porter
is
quite
a
balancing
act
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
not
overwhelmingly
roasty
or
bitter
it
is
smooth
but
delivers
a
crisp
finish
now
that
i
am
empty
they
still
hang
like
warnings
to
those
who
would
dare
to
trespass
again
i
wasnt
sold
until
now
whilst
i
behold
these
stalactital
flavors
drinkability
a
little
better
than
moderate
nice
and
big
robust
scents
and
flavors
a
thick
and
hearty
mouthfeel
is
very
enjoyable
weight
is
heavy
and
the
abv
is
pretty
high
but
well
worth
picking
up
i
may
get
some
more
to
age
for
a
year
or
so
and
see
how
it
does
all
the
expected
flavor
profiles
are
present
in
fact
theyre
nearly
spoton
compared
to
all
of
the
baltic
porters
weve
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
that
said
our
only
gripe
is
that
the
alcohol
is
way
too
hot
too
boozy
and
deters
from
the
experience
as
a
result
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
id
choose
almost
any
other
baltic
porter
before
id
pick
this
one
up
again
d
as
i
mentioned
earlier
the
inability
to
cover
up
the
9
5
abv
killed
this
one
for
me
had
trouble
finishing
off
the
glass
oi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminded
me
alot
of
a
big
stout
but
in
the
initial
flavor
profile
but
where
the
stout
goes
right
on
the
palate
the
baltic
porter
goes
left
the
left
hand
turn
showed
me
what
a
different
style
yeast
can
do
to
a
different
style
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
ticking
this
style
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
black
in
color
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
quite
roasty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
taste
roasty
malt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
chocolate
aftertaste
nice
balance
and
hides
the
alcohol
quite
nice
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
itas
it
is
definitely
good
for
a
bottle
or
two
md
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
coats
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
slow
sipping
beer
to
get
all
of
the
different
flavors
as
it
warms
up
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
alcohol
comes
out
but
it
isnt
overbearing
this
is
a
top
example
of
the
style
that
i
would
certainly
give
a
simple
porter
drinker
to
broaden
their
horizons
a
ris
with
a
baltic
quality
that
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
drink
the
ris
quality
is
there
with
a
slight
smokey
sour
quality
pours
a
nice
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
not
as
dense
as
an
ris
with
a
9
5
abv
ill
just
be
blunt
and
say
its
not
an
ris
its
grittier
more
acidic
and
burnt
in
malt
quality
not
necessary
made
to
be
smoother
either
its
a
hard
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
i
would
say
on
par
with
the
good
baltic
porter
ive
had
in
poland
eerily
similar
to
the
excellent
okocim
porter
too
bad
neither
is
an
easy
find
anywhere
near
me
db
i
got
this
for
free
so
i
cannot
complain
it
is
definitely
9
5
but
in
a
bad
way
it
needs
to
be
hidden
a
lot
more
redeeming
cocoa
and
malt
qualities
masked
by
vodkalike
alcohol
notes
gotta
give
it
some
credit
because
its
not
a
drain
pour
but
cant
even
say
it
tastes
average
a
good
of
example
of
an
imperial
porter
gone
astray
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
dosnt
feel
like
it
is
9
5
abv
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
and
brings
me
lots
of
joy
has
good
drinkability
alone
but
even
better
drinkability
with
spicey
food
i
had
this
with
beef
and
broccoli
and
was
surprised
at
how
much
more
i
enjoyed
it
with
the
spicey
chinese
food
drinkability
a
bit
too
rough
around
the
edges
to
compete
with
some
of
the
better
baltic
porters
think
smuttynose
for
example
but
still
a
decent
enough
beer
overall
a
decent
baltic
porter
nice
flavors
all
around
but
nothing
to
strong
it
is
drinkable
as
well
as
it
warms
i
get
a
lot
more
roasted
malt
flavors
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
very
drinkable
beer
the
abv
is
not
detectable
one
bit
a
rather
rough
full
bodied
beer
at
the
start
but
seems
to
mellow
out
as
the
beer
warms
overall
and
enjoyable
porter
but
not
the
best
from
the
harpoon
leviathan
series
not
being
a
porter
fan
this
beer
gets
me
back
into
the
mood
to
give
porters
another
go
this
is
very
well
brewed
like
the
rest
of
the
leviathan
series
of
beers
sitting
here
on
a
relaxing
weekend
listening
to
dark
side
of
the
moon
and
sipping
this
fine
beer
cant
think
of
better
afternoon
even
with
the
rain
outside
definitely
worth
a
try
nice
job
harpoon
not
bad
at
all
could
do
with
an
improved
mouthfeel
and
perhaps
some
time
to
mellow
the
alcohol
a
touch
but
overall
this
is
a
very
decent
offering
from
harpoon
sweet
and
roasty
malts
are
the
main
show
here
but
there
are
also
some
heavy
coffee
and
alcohol
flavors
as
well
some
tart
cranberry
fruit
is
followed
by
a
leafy
and
roastily
bitter
finish
body
is
medium
and
could
use
a
tad
more
to
compete
with
the
big
flavors
and
alcohol
of
the
beer
this
one
might
be
a
decent
candidate
for
throwing
in
the
cellar
for
another
six
months
or
so
to
let
the
flavors
really
come
together
a
bit
better
d
too
boozy
and
unbalanced
for
my
liking
not
bad
on
the
flavor
profile
but
there
is
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement
d
a
good
porter
not
too
strong
or
rich
a
bit
one
dimensional
still
a
good
experience
from
the
norm
dthis
is
a
very
tasty
brew
it
has
a
great
malt
presence
with
a
light
hop
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
thoroughly
verdict
harpoon
baltic
porter
is
a
solid
beerrich
tasty
and
remarkably
drinkable
a
notch
more
complexity
would
really
put
it
in
the
top
ranks
for
the
style
roasted
malts
and
semisweet
chocolate
flavors
lead
things
off
nicely
malted
milk
charred
smoky
malts
and
rummy
dark
fruit
sweetness
follow
herbal
woody
hop
bitterness
kicks
in
as
the
warming
alcohol
and
fruit
sweetness
peak
dark
chocolate
notes
sail
on
through
a
long
bittersweet
finish
fullbodied
creamy
luxurious
feel
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
nice
d
despite
the
high
abv
this
beer
is
still
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
taste
is
entirely
absent
and
every
sip
is
so
enjoyable
and
pleasant
one
of
the
best
beers
from
harpoon
d
this
beer
was
a
bit
thin
and
it
would
have
been
nice
to
taste
a
bit
more
of
the
malt
flavor
or
have
some
depth
to
it
some
soft
alcohol
warmth
might
have
been
nice
too
thanks
again
to
shogokawada
i
had
been
curious
about
this
beer
food
pairing
i
could
see
this
with
a
hearty
stew
and
the
abv
will
allow
this
to
cut
through
anything
with
a
lot
of
fat
or
oil
steaks
for
instance
very
nice
brew
great
pairing
ready
for
a
repeat
thanks
mikey
d
although
you
can
sense
the
alcohol
it
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
and
smooth
and
it
is
oh
so
smooth
going
down
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
bite
but
its
not
very
fusal
maybe
a
little
bit
but
thatll
go
away
with
age
im
sure
highly
recommend
this
beast
d
for
a
9
5
abv
porter
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
still
not
something
most
people
would
want
more
than
1
or
2
of
anyway
skål
dhighly
drinkable
for
the
style
as
i
said
before
could
easily
pass
for
a
bigger
tasting
porter
though
its
abv
coyuld
prob
get
you
in
trouble
but
still
very
enjoyable
with
it
complex
taste
that
is
not
too
huge
to
make
it
too
much
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
for
the
price
i
dont
think
all
that
highly
of
it
tasted
far
too
much
alcohol
and
didnt
pick
much
up
more
then
roasted
malt
from
the
taste
as
opposed
to
the
popular
euro
brands
of
baltic
porters
you
do
not
get
the
astringency
and
weird
tastes
though
i
expect
more
from
this
beer
though
being
such
a
highly
priced
4pk
so
i
am
going
to
have
to
be
the
dissenting
opinion
and
rate
it
much
lower
then
the
rest
overall
being
a
hophead
a
dark
maltier
beer
is
usually
not
my
calling
this
brew
is
pretty
damn
good
the
alcohol
being
well
hidden
with
the
4
pack
price
you
cant
go
wrong
i
recommend
anyone
to
try
this
one
im
giving
this
beer
a
pretty
good
score
although
overall
i
thought
it
fell
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
for
the
style
which
should
be
a
bit
bigger
and
bolder
than
this
beer
nonetheless
im
scoring
it
for
what
it
is
not
what
i
expected
beautiful
dark
pour
black
as
midnight
some
semisweet
chocolate
in
the
malt
with
wellmoderated
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
roasted
almost
but
not
quite
burned
malt
note
at
the
finish
with
nicely
balanced
hops
bittering
im
not
a
great
fan
of
this
series
of
beers
because
they
tend
to
be
too
strong
tasting
for
the
styles
they
represent
however
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
a
little
strong
for
a
porter
but
very
well
balanced
between
alcohol
hops
and
the
great
smokey
malt
flavor
and
aroma
d
a
bit
heavier
and
more
roasty
than
traditional
baltic
porters
but
still
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
high
abv
is
completely
hidden
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
imperial
porter
mouthfeel
but
it
didnt
disappoint
get
this
if
you
find
it
it
was
a
hefty
price
for
the
4pack

a
a

and

color
with
a
ring
of

very
well
by
the
roasted

drinkability
alchohol
is
well
masked
in

could
get
to
ya
after
a
few
full
flavored
and
very
tasty
recommended
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
roasted
malt
as
well
as
coffee
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
awesome
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
the
alcohol
coming
in
during
the
aftertaste

the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma

with
the
addition
of
some
smoked
malt
this
is
a
very
flavorful
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
very
smooth
and
great
to
drink
the
alcohol
isnt
very
noticable
at
all
which
really
makes
this
brew
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
beer
i
liked
it
a
lot
a
supreme
beast
huge
flavor
and
complexity
with
a
quoff
of
something
much
more
gentle
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
harpoon
is
brewing
right
now
a
nice
sipping
porter
on
a
chilly
or
wet
wintery
night
for
some
reason
i
envision
sipping
this
out
at
sea
on
a
dark
january
night
an
aggressive
pour
yields
a
nice
big
foamy
tan
collar
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
an
aggressive
roasted
malt
and
coffee
over
a
moderate
booze
adequately
carbonated
tangy
alcohol
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
smooth
full
flavored
the
cherry
mocha
boozy
taste
dissipates
quickly
with
an
unexpectedly
dry
characteristic
of
the
body
while
the
booziness
suggested
in
the
nose
and
mouth
feel
are
pretty
significant
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
the
9
5abv
a
benny
the
best
baltic
porter
ever
by
far
no
further
drinks
great
there
is
some
booze
here
as
this
beer
was
clearly
ramped
up
but
its
a
great
choice
take
your
time
and
enjoy
d
even
at
9
5
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
porter
a
good
choice
for
a
cold
chicago
night
in
the
middle
of
january
at
no
point
do
i
detect
an
overwhelming
amount
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
or
in
the
taste
this
brew
is
well
balanced
smooth
and
complex
enough
to
hold
your
interest
all
the
way
through
a
pint
i
find
myself
having
to
think
about
drinking
this
one
slowly
so
that
i
dont
miss
out
on
any
additional
elements
that
might
present
themselves
as
the
beer
warms
at
the
same
time
i
can
easily
see
myself
taking
a
couple
of
big
chugs
and
this
sucker
would
be
gone
thankfully
i
have
exhibited
the
patience
to
opt
for
the
former
this
bottle
was
2
in
a
fourpack
and
im
planning
to
cellar
the
other
2
to
see
how
they
age
i
just
hope
i
can
wait
a
year
or
two
before
drinking
the
others
the
taste
is
mostly
of
smokey
malt
with
a
hefty
alcohol
bight
it
almost
tastes
like
it
burns
the
tongue
when
i
tried
a
big
gulp
almosts
taste
like
im
chasing
it
with
vodka
in
my
opinion
it
adds
to
the
complexity
but
at
the
expense
of
drinkability
d
a
seasonal
favorite
great
for
when
the
weather
drops
one
of
harpoons
better
beers
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
effort
its
way
to
much
alcohol
and
water
in
the
feel
very
sad
softly
carbonated
deep
roasty
body
with
a
somewhat
viscous
silky
chocolate
maltiness
and
a
dry
earthy
hoppy
finish
very
well
balanced
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sweet
chocolate
maltiness
countering
the
roasted
coffee
beanburnt
toast
thats
prominent
up
front
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
with
a
slight
nut
presence
roasty
and
sweet
with
a
subtle
dry
finish
very
good
deep
black
with
very
minimal
head
aroma
coming
off
this
is
quite
strong
and
boozy
smells
pretty
strong
of
raisins
and
dark
fruits
taste
has
a
nice
malt
backbone
im
getting
some
caramel
and
some
raisin
with
some
hotness
of
the
alcohol
nice
and
sweet
like
a
porter
with
a
kick
fairly
drinkable
might
benefit
from
a
little
age
to
balance
the
hotness
out
solid
baltic
porter
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
despite
the
high
abv
i
would
probably
have
more
than
one
good
flavor
and
apperance
not
the
best
but
a
damn
good
representation
of
its
style
would
definitely
have
again
very
drinkable
baltic
porter
a
bit
of
the
bp
edge
but
mostly
tastes
closer
to
a
ris
with
chocolate
malting
a
little
roast
smooth
and
good
drinkability
pours
dark
smells
malty
something
i
would
keep
several
in
the
fridge
if
i
could
sweetish
yet
balanced
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
plain
jane
baltic
porter
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
tried
in
the
leviathan
series
it
was
pretty
easy
to
consume
the
whole
12oz
bottle
and
id
consider
having
it
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
harpoon
but
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
porters
as
the
lactose
is
a
little
out
of
place
in
the
taste
and
the
body
probably
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
best
in
the
style
still
a
good
beer
this
is
outstanding
for
the
style
the
richness
of
dark
malts
with
a
backing
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
makes
for
one
hell
of
a
beer
i
would
have
never
guess
in
a
million
years
that
the
abv
was
so
high
drinkability
i
think
this
is
above
average
for
a
baltic
porter
it
hits
the
style
without
pushing
the
envelope
i
do
like
how
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
i
look
forward
to
finishing
the
four
pack
but
may
not
get
this
again
a
perfectly
above
average
beer
12oz
bottle
served
at
48
degrees
in
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
no

indicated
on
the

two
shades
shy
of

with
a
loose
half
inch

eventually
recedes
into
a
broken

some
thick
bands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
with
decent
adhesion
big
chocolate
nose
and
dark
fruit
taste
follows
nose
but
also
a
bit
of
lactose
in
the
mix
and
some
acidity
that
comes
out
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
somewhat
lively
carbonation
level
lactose
gives
it
a
slightly
creamy
texture
really
tasty
with
a
wellhidden
abv
im
usually
not
big
on
the
style
but
im
loving
this
one
another
outstanding
brew
from
the
leviathan
series
d
a
nice
brew
in
conclusion
this
is
a
nicely
done
baltic
porter
and
a
good
addition
to
the
leviathan
series
hoping
harpoon
produces
more
of
this
for
the
coming
winter
at
9
5
abv
it
warms
you
up
nicely
this
one
would
be
fun
to
age
i
imagine
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
is
this
one
of
my
favorites
from
harpoon
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
just
slightly
above
average
here
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
nothing
im
gonna
go
ga
ga
over
but
im
enjoying
this
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
worth
the
try
but
nothing
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
skal
this
beer
poured
at
srm30
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
when
backlit
and
a
thin
tan
head
rich
malty
aroma
with
chocolate
toffee
and
licorace
complex
notes
deeply
roasted
but
not
burnt
thick
rich
dark
maltiness
with
a
slight
juniper
taste
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
clean
finish
with
warming
from
alcohol
the
flavor
profile
changes
complexity
as
the
beer
warms
slightly
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
not
too
shabby
here
very
drinkable
in
the
way
of
how
it
is
a
beer
not
my
favorite
baltic
porter
but
still
a
very
good
beer
picked
up
a
bottle
from
abes
cold
beer
for
a
couple
bucks
appeared
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
my
glass
i
though
it
made
a
great
dessert
beer
and
was
a
pretty
good
recreation
of
the
style
id
like
to
try
is
sidebyside
with
some
of
the
classic
baltic
porters
the
flavor
was
a
mix
of
dry
cocoa
with
dark
fruit
that
come
off
closer
to
a
cola
taste
to
me
still
it
hits
the
marks
and
hits
them
well
of
being
a
relatively
drinkable
strong
lager
with
both
chocolate
and
fruit
flavors
very
tasty
and
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
md
nice
mouthfeel
and
flavor
it
was
almost
too
sweet
for
me
something
to
sip
on
drinkability
one
of
the
top
imperial
porters
out
there
loved
and
will
drink
again
d
big
boy
beer
probably
the
heftiest
of
the
baltic
porters
ive
tried
as
such
its
a
sipper
but
a
tasty
one
nice
flavor
and
aroma
and
a
special
mouthfeel
i
wont
rave
about
it
but
im
glad
to
have
enjoyed
it
twice
worth
seeking
the
feel
is
creamy
and
milky
smooth
and
buttery
no
grit
this
beer
is
seriously
bitter
and
hefty
a
slow
sipper
and
a
beast
but
a
delicious
beast
d
its
a
toss
up
i
like
porters
but
dont
usually
drink
more
than
1
this
beer
is
no
exception
although
i
enjoyed
it
all
the
way
down
very
filling
i
was
blown
away
by
harpoons
triticus
ale
and
i
have
been
impressed
with
all
of
their
subsequent
leviathan
releases
keep
em
coming
overall
im
not
impressed
especially
after
being
very
pleased
with
the
leviathan
quad
and
especially
the
ipa
i
did
not
enjoy
the
porter
nearly
as
much
and
will
not
be
getting
it
again
there
are
much
better
porters
available
without
the
premium
price
sorry
harpoon
i
love
you
dearly
but
this
one
isnt
up
to
par
bottle
poured
a
dark
black
color
porter
with
a
huge
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
black
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
are
well
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
lightly
bitter
roasted
malt
notes
with
some
dry
black
chocolate
body
is
a
bit
thin
with
good
carbonation
and
no
signs
of
alcohol
a
fuller
body
and
more
chocolate
notes
would
have
made
this
a
pretty
perfect
baltic
porter
but
this
is
very
good
nonetheless
this
is
a
likeable
big
brew
though
it
is
a
bit
overthetop
for
the
style
mouthfeel
was
crisp
yet
creamy
this
was
very
smooth
i
dig
it
flavor
was
big
time
cocoa
and
coffee
all
melding
and
jiving
together
great
roasty
aftertaste
finishes
slightly
bitter
great
baltic
porter
i
kept
gulping
and
the
abv
hit
me
a
bit
be
careful
recommend
medium
to
heavy
body
nice
amount
of
carbonation
creamy
velvety
mouthfeel
one
of
these
a
day
is
enough
for
me
harpoon
makes
some
great
beers
and
this
leviathan
series
is
definately
some
of
there
best
stuff
definately
seek
this
out
exspecially
if
you
enjoy
chocolatey
beers
rich
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
low
drinkability
for
me
in
this
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
the
aftertaste
it
leaves
it
might
be
that
i
just
dont
like
the
style
ill
have
to
try
some
others
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wants
an
otherworldly
beer
experience
if
you
see
it
in
a
store
buy
it
even
if
you
dont
like
porters
get
it
for
a
friend
that
does
just
amazing
d
the
flavors
are
quite
syrupy
and
a
combination
of
excessively
hot
alcohol
and
a
weird
cloying
flavor
in
the
finish
makes
for
low
drinkability
the
big
harpoon
beers
seem
to
be
pretty
hit
or
miss
and
aside
from
the
aroma
this
one
is
a
boozy
sticky
mess
first
of
the
leviathan
series
i
have
been
able
to
get
my
hands
on
poured
into
a
imperial
nonic
a
deep
but
not
opaque
blackthere
is
some
ruby
tint
thru
outa
thinner
off
white
head
atop
that
never
really
sticks
around
for
long
aromas
were
doppelbockish
in
my
minddeep
fruit
and
breadlike
malt
along
with
some
brown
sugar
and
alcoholmore
like
a
hybrid
or
melding
of
styles
in
the
nose
great
malty
flavorssweet
with
big
raisin
notes
mixed
with
bitter
chocolate
and
some
sweetish
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
burn
full
and
lush
in
the
mouth
its
sublime
but
the
alcohol
does
creep
as
it
warmsa
kick
ass
brew
meant
to
be
drank
one
at
a
time
dont
let
this
steer
you
away
its
a
really
great
beer
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
bringing
me
back
a
4pack
of
this
and
the
dipa
from
vt
yeah
you
can
get
this
in
pa
but
not
this
cheap
yes
people
there
are
great
8
four
packs
out
there
but
not
in
this
fucking
state
this
goes
for
3
a
single
12
a
four
pack
here
appears
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
within
minutes
smells
and
tastes
of
rich
roasted
grains
caramelized
malts
whoppers
milk
chocolate
mildly
roasted
coffee
bittersweet
baking
cocoa
a
notch
below
medium
in
body
actually
a
little
thin
which
is
surprising
for
a
baltic
porter
medium
carbonation
alcohol
is
rather
invisible
still
despite
the
thin
body
this
one
drinks
great
glad
i
have
three
more
leviathan
baltic
porter
pours
black
with
a
clear
red
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
tiny
head
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malts
upfront
with
bits
of
coffee
and
maybe
some
dark
chocolate
the
astringency
i
smell
does
not
appear
in
the
flavor
there
are
tons
of
sweet
chocolate
roasted
flavors
and
dark
fruit
up
front
with
so
much
complexity
its
hard
at
times
to
pick
everything
out
there
is
a
distinct
dry
roasted
flavor
underneith
it
all
that
balances
out
the
sweetness
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
the
beer
is
rich
and
creamy
and
hides
its
alcohol
until
the
last
minute
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
leviathan
series
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
one
drinks
okay
considering
abv
shows
d
i
really
like
the
effort
harpoon
is
putting
into
this
series
attempting
to
branch
out
to
new
styles
in
the
future
this
wont
be
the
beer
i
go
for
when
i
crave
a
baltic
porter
but
it
does
as
admirable
job
engaging
with
what
this
style
does
wellroasted
sweet
taste
velvety
mouthfeel
and
big
alcohol
this
will
be
much
better
with
another
6
months
on
it
hopefully
i
dont
finish
the
other
bottles
too
soon
even
mouthfeel
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
finishes
a
bit
puckery
and
dry
slight
warming
and
cheek
numbness
from
the
abv
decent
drinkability
the
beer
is
fairly
easy
to
drink

and
i
find
it
to
be
fairly
enjoyable
a
nice
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
w
high
drinkability
this
beer
left
me
wanting
more
an
uncommon
quality
usually
this
is
a
very
satisfying
baltic
porterkudos
harpoon
i
could
really
get
to
like
harpoons
leviathan
series
the
ipa
was
great
as
is
this
porter
plus
the
labels
are
really
cool
the
beer
was
a
deep
deep
black
with
red
highlights
it
had
a
modest
tan
head
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
somw
sweetness
made
the
aroma
in
taste
first
up
was
sweet
chocolate
then
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
followed
by
coffee
nicely
bitter
coffee
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
noticeable
great
beer
endlessly
drinkable
i
think
im
underrating
this
just
slightly
but
what
is
really
superb
here
is
its
easy
full
body
and
balance
of
flavors
very
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
good
offer
from
harpoon
worth
trying
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
paring
i
would
pair
this
drink
with
apples
and
cheese
for
cheese
i
would
go
with
a
pepper
jack
or
a
smoked
gouda
i
could
also
see
this
going
well
with
smoked
meat
such
as
smoked
salmon
and
whole
grain
crackers
but
the
apples
and
cheese
would
win
out
first
pours
jet
black
with
scents
of
roasted
malts
licorice
and
alcohol
being
it
is
almost
a
10abv
taste
is
rather
smooth
the
alcohol
is
not
as
present
here
taste
is
also
roast
malts
mixed
black
licorice
with
a
slight
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
coats
your
teeth
and
throat
overall
this
is
a
great
porter
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
the
finish
is
medium
to
medium
full
and
lingers
on
the
palate
for
a
bit
making
it
refreshing
the
beer
is
all
around
well
balanced
the
flavor
are
rounded
and
refreshing
this
is
the
first
baltic
porter
and
i
like
all
the
flavors
in
this
beer
it
is
very
clean
and
the
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
a
very
tasty
brew
although
the
head
was
not
persistent
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
smoky
fruity
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
some
dark
fruits
slight
smoke
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
from
harpoon
thanks
matt
the
pour
was
very
nice
rich
dark
brown
and
essentially
completely
opaque
as
i
look
at
it
a
nice
head
of
light
tan
about
a
half
inch
in
height
comes
up
and
over
the
top
settling
down
nicely
into
a
thin
film
that
coated
the
inside
of
the
glass
very
nicely
rich
aroma
here
of
dark
fruits
touches
of
molasses
and
rich
dark
chocolate
a
touch
of
bitterness
or
sour
as
it
warms
up
and
gets
even
thicker
the
flavor
was
excellent
classic
for
the
style
indeed
rich
notes
of
burnt
chocolate
dark
prune
like
fruits
a
touch
of
sour
cherries
and
sweet
molasses
coat
the
tongue
as
the
full
and
rich
body
on
this
one
leave
you
looking
for
another
smooth
sip
right
after
the
first
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
that
made
this
one
a
really
fine
sipper
that
i
cannot
argue
against
this
was
a
real
highlight
for
me
and
top
notch
beer
for
sure
mouthfell
is
good
moderate
carbonation
i
would
give
this
another
try
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
but
i
would
reach
for
several
other
baltics
before
heading
back
to
this
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
slight
ruby
outlines
a
full
two
finger
light
tan
head
slowly
crawls
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaving
a
spotty
layer
of
chunky
stick
smell
is
musty
and
malty
with
dark
fruits
and
cocoa
powder
some
cardboard
brown
sugar
and
brandy
in
the
nose
as
well
ehh
not
a
bad
smelling
beer
but
by
no
means
wonderful
taste
starts
off
with
a
warm
booze
flavor
dates
raisins
and
fig
midway
smokey
malts
and
molasses
emerge
on
the
tongue
aftertaste
burns
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
bitter
chocolate
flavor
if
it
wasnt
for
the
over
the
top
alcohol
it
wouldnt
be
too
bad
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
feel
and
flowing
carbonation
tough
to
put
down
because
of
the
alcohol
burn
worth
a
shot
but
an
average
beer
overall
bad
example
of
a
baltic
porter
this
is
like
an
okocim
missing
all
the
good
qualties
this
beer
is
one
strong
beer
had
a
nice
kick
to
it
and
still
had
some
nice
flavor
to
it
that
kept
it
from
being
too
much
to
handle
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
picked
up
for
10
at
andover
liquors
ive
never
had
a
proclaimed
baltic
porter
before
so
i
dont
really
know
the
difference
in
brewing
process
but
they
will
certainly
receive
more
of
my
attention
if
this
is
a
good
example
tm
the
taste
is
huge
lots
of
sweet
malty
character
with
a
thick
and
rich
mouthfeel
you
really
taste
molasses
up
front
with
a
sweet
over
ripened
plum
taste
following
some
woody
notes
but
very
subtle
just
an
awesome
hearty
baltic
porter
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
mouthfeel
creamy
and
chewy
like
a
frappe
tastes
like
cold
hot
chocolate
molasses
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruity
alcohol
dark
heavy
and
decadent
this
is
like
a
pastry
shop
beer
so
good
i
had
to
take
a
nap
afterwards
the
drinkability
is
very
good
the
abv
is
expertly
hidden
and
it
provides
plenty
of
clean
comlexity
that
isnt
overwhelming
at
any
point
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
baltic
porter
pours
a
very
dark
red
almost
black
but
nice
ruby
hues
in
the
edges
of
the
glass
big
and
thick
light
tan
head
forms
drops
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
on
its
way
down
to
a
medium
sized
ring

i
like
the
licorice
character
in
this
one
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
a
pretty
solid
example
of
the
style
a
truly
impressive
baltic
porter
this
is
what
an
american
iteration
of
a
baltic
should
be
rich
and
vibrant
strong
emphasis
on
the
fruitiness
and
the
sweetness
with
a
good
deal
of
depth
and
complexity
of
flavors
the
alcohol
isnt
overwhelming
or
overly
woodybourbonyaged
tasting
everything
works
harmoniously
together
to
create
something
beautiful
and
true
to
style
overall
great
baltic
porter
hits
on
every
point
i
was
looking
for
and
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
my
favorite
remains
the
baltic
thunder
by
victory
great
value
but
pick
this
one
up
before
its
gone
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
although
sometimes
the
warming
sensation
is
a
bit
stronger
than
it
should
be
other
than
that
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
right
for
it
worth
a
shot
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
with
a
ruby
red
hue
when
held

not
much

taste

very
complex
dark

earthy
roasted
maltschocolate
and
coffee
are
all
there
nice
burn
in
the
finish
this
beer
was
awesome
serving
type
bottle
mouthfeel
has
a
fuller
body
than
a
standard
porter
which
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
baltic
porter
often
these
bigger
porters
seem
like
a
juiced
up
porter
in
the
abv
but
no
other
real
distinction
very
enjoyable
i
would
like
to
get
more
to
age
pours
a
dark
brown
with
chestnut
colored
edges
one
finger
of
foamy
tan
head
fades
quickly
but
has
nice
retention
from
swirling
and
leaves
nice
lacing

of
roasted
malts

faint
spicy

in

smooth

chalky
with
some
nice
alcohol
warmth
not
very
assertive
at
all
the
flavors
were
very
subdued
and
ho
hum
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
a
very
memorable
baltic
porter
to
me
at
all
dont
really
like
this
one
the
balance
is
just
off
give
me
a
gonzo
porter
instead
d
notes
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
huge
improvement
over
the
dipa
released
in
this
series
complex
made
for
sipping
wish
i
had
access
to
this
on
a
regular
basis
tasty
offering
from
harpoon
west
coast
brewers
need
to
get
familiar
with
this
style
asap
please
yesterday
thanks
edit
oh
wow
how
did
i
miss
this
let
this
beer
warm
for
at
least
20
minutes
as
you
drink
it
a
dark
chocolate
flavor
creeps
into
the
background
very
subtle
and
really
wonderful
rounds
out
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
much
fuller
and
makes
the
flavor
profile
much
more
complete
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
just
plain
intrusive
i
cant
put
it
any
other
way
as
its
not
a
brew
that
urges
you
to
take
another
sip
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
but
1
bottle
was
enough
a
beautiful
baltic
porter
to
look
at
but
that
is
where
the
compliments
end
the
artificial
sweetness
bland
hop
character
and
intense
alcohol
are
all
out
of
balanced
drawbacks
to
this
offering
unfortunately
unpleasant
would
be
too
kind
of
a
description
for
this
brew
if
you
respect
your
tastebuds
please
avoid
this
one
d
excellent
this
is
good
beer
well
worth
a
try
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
about
a
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
great
aroma
lots
of
malty
sweetness
caramel
toffee
some
molasses
chocolate
plums
and
dark
cherries
make
up
the
complex
aroma
taste
is
good
as
well
there
is
a
distinct
sweetness
upfront
that
yields
a
bit
to
the
darker
malts
and
esters
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
bitterness
here
but
some
hints
of
hop
flavor
a
the
end
relatively
clean
yeast
profile
and
an
unobtrusive
alcohol
presence
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
mediumfull
body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
rather
enjoyed
this
brew
and
found
it
to
be
a
better
than
average
representation
of
the
style
i
look
forward
to
having
another
drinkability
overall
this
beer
fits
the
style
and
once
warmed
a
bit
becomes
nicely
rounded
but
i
think
the
fruitiness
is
a
bit
overdone
perhaps
personal
preference
beyond
that
i
think
its
nicely
put
together
and
a
fairly
impressive
pint
i
like
the
way
that
its
sweetish
at
first
but
that
i
can
find
myself
with
some
leafy
hops
and
soft
caramel
lingering
long
after
its
been
gone
overall
an
excellent
balance
and
a
very
good
beer
for
an
exotic
beer
its
pretty
subdued
there
are
no
extreme
pronounced
flavors
in
the
beer
and
it
doesnt
smell
like
much
the
flavor
is
very
simply
roasted
barley
otherwise
anything
more
and
it
would
be
a
truly
great
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
nice
baltic
porter
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
even
with
the
high
alcohol
taste
pours
a
really
dark
brown

the
faintest
of

wicked
brew
almost

just
a

definitely
have
a
few
of
these

for
a
750ml
bottle
from

wine
wells
me
fairly
heavy
but
elevated
by
the
carbonation
which
is
just
about
right
for
the
density
of
this
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not

strong
kick
good
representation
of

not
the
best
baltic
porter
that
ive
had
but
a
good
strong
darker
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
a
good
brew
from
harpoon
i
hope
this
series
continues
would
love
some
more
though
the
3
i
have
left
ill
be
adding
the
the
cellar
stock
drinkable
a
rather
drinkable
baltic
porter
in
my
opinion
despite
its
heaviness
once
again
im
impressed
with
the
leviathan
series
from
harpoon
solid
to
drink
have
heard
good
things
and
am
glad
i
took
the
opportunity
to
sample
finally
i
dont
consider
this
the
kind
of
multilayered
distinctly
complex
baltic
porter
that
i
know
and
love
it
was
actually
more
like
an
imperial
irish
dry
stout
i
mean
it
certainly
didnt
stop
short
of
being
burnt
nor
did
it
carry
a
wellaged
type
of
alcohol
warmth
instead
harpoon
went
full
roast
ahead
and
combined
scorched
malt
with
scorching
alcohol
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
however
since
id
have
to
trade
to
get
it
since
its
not
available
around
me
high
abv
feels
quite
nice
this
beer
fits
in
nicely
in
the
series
with
the
leviathan
iipa
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
might
prefer
a
little
lower
abv
a
great
baltic
porter
that
i
will
have
again
in
the
near
future

to
learn
that
this

is
packing
9

abv
because
i
could
barely
detect
a

not

in
the

not

i
expected
to
have
a

nope

pack
poured
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
a
rather
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
a
very
thin
ring
deep
brown
color
almost
black
smells
sweet
and
smokey
i
can
smell
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
its
very
faint
tastes
like
sweet
malt
and
the
alcohol
is
more
noticable
in
the
taste
than
it
is
in
the
smell
it
also
tastes
smokey
and
almost
coffeelike
tastes
spicy
too
although
i
cant
identify
the
spice
its
got
a
full
body
mouthfeel
this
a
thicker
porter
feels
nice
and
smooth
though
its
very
drinakble
but
theres
no
doubt
this
is
a
sipping
beer
this
is
the
third
four
pack
of
this
that
i
have
purchased
so
needless
to
say
id
be
happy
to
buy
it
again
this
is
a
great
finishing
brew
for
the
night
for
me
especially
on
this
snowy
new
england
night
i
have
had
better
baltics
but
this
one
is
spot
on
style
bought
the
fourpack
recently
appearance
was
a
dark
black
appearance
with
small
hints
of
amber
in
light
patchy
lacing
on
the
sides
and
a
medium
sized
head
that
dwindled
to
a
thin
layer
after
a
couple
of
minutes
the
aromas
have
a
bready
maltyaspect
to
it
sensed
some
raisinplum
aspect
to
it
mouthfeel
helped
make
the
drink
really
creamy
and
silky
aiding
in
the
taste
overall
a
fine
baltic
porter
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
14
dark
tan
head
over
the
somewhat
cloudy
reddish
brown
brew
head
is
promptly
down
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
and
skim
with
leggy
slowfalling
lace
aroma
is
sweet
dark
malts
and
smoke
taste
begins
with
the
darkmaltiness
then
lets
in
the
smoky
leatheriness
which
all
works
nicely
together
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
very
good
drinkability
for
the
abv
enjoyable
offering
d
id
like
to
try
this
at
near
cellar
temp
pretty
darn
good
though
great
interpretation
of
this
beer
and
with
baltic
porters
being
a
personal
favorite
very
enjoyable
overall
nice
effort
with
this
big
beer
style
it
is
a
decent
example
of
a
baltic
porter
and
would
definitely
drink
this
again
i
like
what
harpoon
does
with
their
100
barrel
series
but
this
is
more
generic
and
harpoons
house
flavors
linger
in
this
beer
drinkability
isnt
terrible
but
ive
had
much
better
baltic
porters
a
great
experiment
by
harpoon
lets
get
this
in
regular
circulation
very
dark
brown
with
mahogany
edges
thin
tan
cap
of
fine
bubbles
the
head
fell
to
a
skim
and
collar
of
coarser
bubbles
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
spotty
lacing
behind
strong
roast
and
coffee
aroma
cherries
a
bit
nutty
some
dry
cocoa
pretty
much
the
same
in
the
flavour
more
nuts
maybe
and
the
fruitycherry
flavour
was
more
pronounced
chalky
towards
the
end
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
with
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
warmth
sort
of
dry
but
with
a
creamy
texture
well
integrated
carbonation
medium
to
full
body
pretty
good
stuff
no
complaints
here
out
of
a
standard
size
bottle
this
beer
was
an
opaque
black
with
a
huge
threefinger
tan
head
very
good
retention
finally
became
a
thin
skim
and
the
lacing
was
good
too
the
aroma
was
fairly
light
but
nice
roasted
malt
and
caramel
malt
with
some
grainy
notes
and
hints
of
bitterness
and
nuts
the
flavors
were
sweet
at
first
an
explosion
of
toffee
and
caramel
followed
quickly
by
a
distinct
nuttiness
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
that
then
became
a
long
coffeelike
finish
well
balanced
and
not
quite
cloying
because
of
it
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
carbonation
light
but
in
my
opinion
perfect
for
the
style
and
the
body
rich
and
full
the
alcohol
was
wellconcealed
and
i
found
it
very
drinkable
for
being
such
a
punchy
beast
in
a
category
with
much
depth
a
great
dark
beer
nice
and
hearty
with
tons
of
lacing
and
a
beautiful
dark
color
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
with
some
dark
fruit
undertones
blended
together
amazingly
with
a
nice
zing
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
and
really
warms
you
up
try
this
one
out
serving
type
bottle
d
very
good
nice
sipper
on
this
cold
afternoon
will
buy
again
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
some
red
undertones
small
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
definitly
smelling
some
roasted
chocolate
notes
hints
of
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
present
in
the
nose
very
light
mouthfeel
for
the
style
high
carbonation
but
fairly
smooth
even
at
9
the
taste
is
balanced
leaning
slightly
towards
the
sweet
side
definitly
some
dark
fruit
notes
simmering
around
in
there
finish
is
smooth
and
satisfying
with
slightly
less
carbonation
and
a
deeper
flavor
profile
this
could
be
an
absolutly
amazing
beer
as
it
is
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
for
harpoon
and
highly
drinkable
not
the
best
baltic
porter
ive
ever
had
but
another
great
offering
in
this
series
good
job
guys
pours
like
coke
dark
brown
with
some
red
undertones
and
a
small
tan
head
and
some
light
lacing
the
smell
is
rich
with
roasted
malts
and
bitter
chocolate
and
some
lingering
mocha
notes
taste
is
interesting
with
some
rather
pronounced
cherry
and
dark
fruit
flavors
worked
into
the
deep
roasted
malts
and
a
sustained
bitterness
the
mouthfell
is
to
light
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
like
a
much
smaller
lighter
beer
of
course
this
bumps
up
the
drinkability
a
few
notches
overall
a
good
beer
from
harpoon
not
as
good
as
the
1st
leviathan
but
still
very
good
drinkability
excellent
porter
has
a
complex
sweet
taste
that
warms
you
right
up
the
body
and
taste
make
this
an
excellent
sippin
beer
tasty
but
one
or
two
would
do
for
me
buy
it
and
try
it
d
pretty
drinkable
as
i
could
finish
the
whole
bottle
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
as
good
beer
taste
contains
a
sweet
yet
boozy
makeup
of
chocolate
and
black
cherry
at
the
center
carbonation
is
crisp
and
the
abv
on
the
beer
is
noticeable
finish
provides
a
warmth
of
alcohol
blended
into
a
sea
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
while
a
coffee
bitterness
appeal
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
another
plus
out
of
the
leviathan
series
pours
very
dark
brown
in
a
pint
glass
it
might
come
off
as
pitch
black
thinner
creme
head
nose
is
precisely
what
i
expect
a
baltic
porter
to
be
that
highly
fruity
sweet
tone
with
molasses
like
malts
flavor
is
very
nice
mildly
bitter
sweet
tone
that
carries
a
highly
robust
overall
tone
and
a
fairly
long
lasting
character
feel
is
quite
smooth
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
backs
it
up
remaining
low
and
just
right
this
is
an
excellent
version
of
this
style
i
have
had
a
chance
to
try
numerous
versions
of
baltic
porters
from
eastern
europe
and
this
is
as
good
and
better
than
most
a
must
try
for
those
familiar
with
the
style
and
those
looking
to
learn
excellent
1098
creamy
latte
flavor
with
the
emphasis
on
the
coffee
moderate
body
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
a
very
light
sweetness
to
the
brew
d
nice
beer
but
alcohol
will
limit
drinkability
one
will
do
enough
to
puzzle
at
this
riddle
and
to
get
the
throat
and
belly
toasty
assuredly
a
sipper
the
density
of
its
shortlived
glow
is
this
beers
featured
virtue
muted
restrained
secretive
potent
very
strong
dark
fruit
presence
throughout
kind
surprised
me
for
a
porter
i
guess
im
used
to
smoky
stouty
like
porters
still
pleasant
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
probably
only
drink
one
at
a
time
surprised
by
this
one
dark
black
with
a
tannish
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
bittersweet
chocolate
and
specialty
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
nose
and
taste
some
dark
fruit
a
faint
but
pleasant
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
boozy
acidity
in
the
finish
nice
full
body
very
warming
and
great
for
a
cold
winter
night
harpoon
does
it
on
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
fine
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
chocolate
nose
its
dry
with
a
subtle
sweetness
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
rich
alcohol
filled
taste
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
special
roast
malts
its
slow
and
warming
on
the
way
down
with
a
rich
mellow
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
harpoon
has
another
winner
in
the
leviathan
series
its
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
even
at
9
5
tastes
of
semi
sweet
cocoa
hints
of
yeasty
dark
fruit
finishes
with
a
mild
acidic
bitterness
courtesy
of
the
roasted
malts
and
warming
alcohol
at
first
the
mouthfeel
appears
thin
but
seems
to
grow
prior
to
swallowing
creating
an
interesting
and
varied
feel
very
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
acts
as
a
compliment
rather
than
a
hindrance
to
this
fine
beer
by
far
my
favorite
from
harpoon
who
i
had
previously
thought
less
of
as
a
brewery
fantastic
on
this
cold
late
fall
evening
whoa
this
is
one
fine
brew
pours
a
dark
chocolate
with
a
small
head
very
enticing
smell
is
deep
and
rich
smooth
malts
waft
the
nostrils
very
nicely
taste
is
roasted
dark
malt
that
lingers
on
the
palate
with
a
very
nice
sticky
presence
alcohol
is
hidden
very
nicely
a
hop
presence
is
there
on
the
finish
well
done
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
exceptional
this
is
a
definite
sipper
but
the
lack
of
harsh
alcohol
presence
puts
this
one
in
the
exceptional
category
this
one
is
nice
but
i
am
on
the
fence
about
how
sweet
it
seems
but
somehow
seems
to
make
it
more
drinkable
very
nice
job
by
harpoon
and
better
than
the
iipa
me
thinks
thought
that
was
nice
drinkability
nice
sipping
beer
in
the
winter
time
would
buy
this
againwas
the
better
of
yje
4
beers
in
had
in
my
recent
session
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
but
still
a
bit
hot
with
alcohol
i
dont
mind
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
with
this
type
of
beer
but
ymmv
despite
the
strong
alcohol
presence
this
a
drinkable
brew
the
many
intense
flavors
kept
me
wanting
to
taste
more
at
over
9
a
couple
of
these
will
keep
you
warm
on
a
cold
night
d
for
9
5
its
a
darn
drinkable
beer
surprisingly
drinkable
until
that
alcohol
taste
rears
its
ugly
head
surprised
that
i
dont
get
some
of
it
with
every
sip
either
way
it
kinda
kills
this
one
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
carbonation
level
leaves
something
to
be
desired
needs
to
be
properly
aged
in
order
for
the
good
flavors
to
come
out
better
drinkability
for
a
baltic
porter
its
great
anyone
that
is
a
fan
of
the
style
needs
to
jump
on
this
one
excellent
tasted
from
a
growler
poured
at
the
boston
brewery
saturday
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
healthy
2
tan
head
smell
is
not
overpowering
but
some
roasted
burnt
malt
and
some
coffee
as
well
lots
of
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
as
well
i
get
some
bitter
chocolate
some
sugar
and
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
lots
of
flavor
that
lasts
and
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
tastes
like
it
is
a
very
strong
beer
you
can
tell
it
is
a
baltic
a
bit
more
bitter
and
mouthfeel
is
sharp
not
very
smooth
fairly
drinkable
at
9
but
i
would
not
down
more
than
one
pint
thanks
mike
drinkability
not
off
the
charts
drinkable
but
certainly
somewhat
sessionable
even
at
the
lofty
height
of
9
5
abv
disappointing
expected
more
not
a
great
taste
or
balance
this
is
a
very
boozy
beer
i
would
think
cellaring
this
would
be
great
i
get
chocolate
slight
orange
in
the
taste
but
the
alcohol
overpowers
most
of
the
taste
not
very
impressed
in
a
year
or
two
of
sitting
mite
be
a
really
good
beer
smelt
like
the
chocolate
oragne
that
gets
cracked
open
taste
wasnt
too
far
off
but
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
if
you
like
porters
its
a
nice
variation
to
the
genre
3
335
not
bad
it
just
needs
more
cohesion
a
bigass
balticstyle
porter
with
blood
orange
peel
and
cacao
nibs
big
on
darkness
with
a
brown
lacing
on
top
big
nose
and
palate
of
dark
fruit
and
highly
roasted
grain
both
of
which
give
off
suggestions
of
dark
fruit
and
coffee
chocolate
comes
from
the
cacao
nibs
obviously
massive
chewy
body
and
the
9
0
abv
is
noticeable
there
is
some
orange
peel
in
here
but
this
beer
is
just
too
big
for
it
really
to
make
a
good
showing
perhaps
there
is
a
pinch
of
it
middle
to
end
but
pretty
damn
subtle
also
the
addition
of
cacao
could
easily
be
confused
for
additions
of
dark
malt
if
it
was
not
on
the
label
i
would
not
even
think
about
it
regardless
good
drinking
all
around
overall
unlike
many
of
the
other
reviewers
i
was
able
to
pick
out
the
blood
orange
tones
perhaps
it
was
the
power
of
suggestion
but
i
could
smell
it
and
taste
it
pretty
impressed
with
this
brew
coming
from
saranac
i
have
tasted
some
good
beers
in
their
high
peaks
line
it
pours
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
very
little
head
the
color
is
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
the
head
having
a
slight
orange
tint
to
the
otherwise
lighter
brown
the
smell
is
pretty
strong
with
chocolate
with
no
real
hints
of
orange
mouthfeel
is
overall
smooth
but
with
sharp
carbonation
coming
late
taste
is
dark
and
slightly
bitter
chocolate
there
is
hardly
any
orange
taste
just
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
it
would
be
easy
to
confuse
this
with
just
another
chocolate
porter
overall
quite
good
solid
dark
brown
with
a
stingy
off
white
head
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
with
hints
of
earth
the
flavor
is
mostly
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
citrus
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
of
orange
as
i
found
almost
none
pours
almost
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
very
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
body
is
on
the
light
side
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
there
is
no
hint
of
orange
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
baltic
porter
not
very
good
this
brewery
continues
to
disappoint
o
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
one
it
had
about
a
year
of
age
on
it
and
i
think
that
it
brought
out
some
of
the
chocolaty
notes
they
should
make
this
a
winter
seasonal
because
its
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
beer
from
saranac
i
would
recommend
that
saranac
makes
this
a
winter
seasonal
release
usually
i
shy
away
from
saranac
beers
but
i
received
this
as
a
gift
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
good
to
drink
now
but
may
show
more
complexity
with
age
so
the
beer
is
not
really
orangey
it
does
have
a
notable
chocolate
malt
character
present
both
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
roasted
malty
a
bit
woody
somewhat
sweet
the
smell
has
a
fleeting
spiciness
and
floral
quality
like
orange
blossoms
but
not
a
real
orange
flavor
full
in
body
but
just
a
tad
thin
in
the
latter
finish
well
balanced
lots
of
flavor
i
like
this
beer
but
its
not
a
chocolate
orange
for
sure
good
porter
but
i
really
didnt
get
the
orange
flavor
they
were
going
for
worth
trying
at
any
rate
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
half
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
citrus
orange
zest
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
orange
milk
chocolate
and
subtle
dark
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
if
i
am
honest
here
i
really
dont
know
what
they
were
trying
to
do
while
the
chocolate
and
orange
aspect
was
definitely
there
im
not
sure
it
worked
so
great
together
luckily
there
was
some
dark
fruit
character
going
on
to
help
add
a
nice
medium
to
the
brew
otherwise
this
one
could
have
been
a
disaster
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
i
would
leave
it
at
that
overall
a
very
drinkable
baltic
porter
that
leans
towards
the
chocolate
side
pretty
good
beer
here
this
has
great
flavor
its
rich
chocolaty
and
roasty
its
smooth
and
unique
if
i
see
this
on
the
shelves
again
i
will
definitely
buy
another
bomber
overall
this
beer
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
orange
wasnt
very
strong
but
it
was
a
nice
addition
to
the
roast
id
have
another
o
chocolate
and
orange
isnt
the
first
fruitchocolate
pairing
that
would
come
to
mind
beer
is
actually
pretty
good
and
has
a
nice
bitter
orange
peel
aroma
and
flavor
worth
a
try
but
not
sure
i
would
have
again
o
very
well
rounded
porter
the
9
abv
is
very
well
hidden
the
closer
to
room
temp
the
better
this
beer
is
o
overall
it
is
a
great
stout
i
mean
err
robust
porter
but
i
think
when
you
put
chocolate
orange
on
the
label
you
better
make
damn
sure
you
can
pick
out
the
orange
really
tasty
really
chocolatey
but
the
orange
is
mia
it
seems
to
possibly
pick
up
a
little
as
it
warms
but
still
a
beautiful
looking
dark
beer
with
big
chewy
tan
foam
head
the
lacing
is
thick
and
beautiful
between
sips
the
body
is
dark
doesnt
let
any
light
through
it
the
aroma
has
big
ballsy
cocoa
nibs
and
orange
fruit
notes
of
citric
bursts
clean
beautiful
cohesion
coming
through
flavor
full
dark
malt
flavors
come
forth
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
flowing
along
big
sweet
maltiness
balanced
with
dark
roass
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fuller
bodied
with
even
smooth
flowing
carbonation
pretty
nice
beer
from
saranac
its
hard
to
believe
theyre
making
beer
like
this
in
utica
ny
picked
up
a
bomber
from
brilbecks
in
syracuse
the
orange
doesnt
come
out
until
you
give
this
beer
time
to
warm
up
but
once
its
there
the
orange
peel
makes
a
fine
complement
to
the
dark
malts
the
chocolate
here
isnt
that
strong
the
barley
has
a
clean
roasted
brown
malt
flavor
in
addition
to
the
cocoa
and
i
cant
say
i
taste
the
cacao
nibs
at
all
the
orange
component
tastes
sweet
and
a
little
juicy
but
it
doesnt
overshadow
the
barley
the
body
is
light
for
a
9
abv
porter
but
not
inappropriately
so
and
not
surprising
for
a
saranac
beer
overall
it
makes
a
nice
not
too
heavy
dessert
beer
with
the
classic
orange
and
chocolate
pairing
o
a
bit
blunt
at
first
the
chocolate
and
coffee
roast
are
dark
and
dominating
while
the
alcohol
surely
flexes
its
muscle
as
well
it
takes
a
few
sips
but
things
do
smooth
out
a
bit
once
your
tongue
becomes
accustomed
to
the
heavy
handed
roasty
and
alcohol
nature
saranac
definitely
amped
things
up
a
bit
from
their
usual
offering
here
with
a
dark
silty
roasty
treat
worhty
of
a
try
a
decent
baltic
porter
here
some
aging
will
knock
the
alcohol
down
enough
to
bring
out
the
chocolate
and
orange
half
pour
thankfully
served
in
a
6oz
wine
glass
deep
dark
brownblack
color
capped
with
a
nice
foamy
mocha
head
aroma
of
roasty
dark
malts
coffee
notes
probably
about
robust
enough
to
be
a
stout
taste
of
dark
malts
roasty
cocoa
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
pine
in
the
finish
and
a
ubiquitous
booziness
throughout
i
got
more
booze
than
anything
in
this
one
really
and
it
detracted
from
the
mouthfeel
quite
a
bit
body
is
no
more
than
middleoftheroad
medium
leaving
no
doubt
that
this
is
no
stout
low
carbonation
which
was
good
considering
it
wasnt
very
smooth
otherwise
pretty
decent
overall
but
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
the
sample
i
had
summary
by
far
the
best
ive
ever
had
from
saranac
ever
living
in
albany
ive
been
there
many
many
times
for
all
their
beers
and
a
number
of
special
events
this
beer
is
outstanding
whilst
labeled
a
baltic
porter
this
big
complex
balanced
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
hows
they
hide
the
9
abc
so
well
a
genus
of
a
beer
highly
recommended
overall
i
found
this
one
at
a
shop
notorious
for
jacking
up
bomber
prices
so
if
you
find
this
for
under
8
bucks
pick
it
up
agreeing
with
everyone
in
saying
this
is
the
best
beer
these
guys
ever
put
out
i
could
taste
the
booze
a
bit
and
was
just
a
bit
affected
by
it
when
i
made
my
way
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
at
all
and
the
roasted
and
creamy
notes
to
this
beer
give
it
a
nice
body
without
weighing
it
down
lots
of
foods
like
mousse
cake
or
pudding
would
go
well
with
this
but
lets
face
it
when
you
get
a
beer
this
works
this
well
on
its
own
just
enjoy
the
work
of
art
for
what
it
is
props
to
matt
for
pushing
the
boundaries
with
this
and
redefining
the
potential
of
what
a
saranac
beer
can
be
overall
probably
the
best
offering
saranac
has
produced
to
date
if
you
did
not
tell
me
this
beer
was
supposed
to
contain
orange
i
would
not
have
explicitly
known
but
regardless
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
baltic
porter
this
beer
would
be
excellent
with
vanilla
ice
cream
and
id
even
be
willing
to
give
it
a
shot
with
orange
sherbet
or
sorbet
onot
a
bad
porter
but
expected
more
orange
in
the
flavor
and
there
was
almost
no
orange
in
the
nose
i
liked
it
but
could
needed
more
emphasis
on
the
orange
still
recommend
on
tap
pours
a
dark
black
with
an
inch
of
frothy
brown
head
aromas
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
some
citrus
lots
of
lacing
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malts
and
some
orange
peel
bitter
dark
chocolate
a
bit
smoky
does
have
some
chocolate
orange
flavor
to
it
but
more
dark
chocolate
than
orange
still
well
done
heavy
mouthfeel
overall
i
am
impressed
worth
seeking
out
for
sure
o
ive
really
been
loving
the
offerings
that
have
been
coming
out
from
saranac
as
of
late
and
as
far
as
im
aware
this
is
going
to
be
just
the
beginning
i
gotta
say
i
was
a
little
intrigued
to
see
matt
going
out
and
making
a
beer
like
thisi
have
had
mixed
feelings
about
their
high
peaks
seriesthis
was
a
hands
down
big
winner
pours
nearly
jet
black
except
for
some
ruby
tinge
when
held
in
the
lighta
thick
rocky
deep
mocha
colored
head
atop
the
aromas
are
really
nice
they
just
dont
jump
out
yathe
blood
orange
comes
thru
along
sweetish
chocolate
and
sweet
alcohol
with
a
bit
of
roast
as
well
really
nice
complexity
on
the
palate
with
a
mix
of
bittersweet
chocolateblood
orangesweet
alcoholand
a
healthy
roastiness
and
earthy
finish
i
went
back
and
forth
on
the
mouthfeel
between
3
54
and
4
and
went
with
the
4
because
it
did
coat
the
mouth
and
it
did
glide
down
easy
this
is
a
great
baltic
porterthe
matt
guys
put
some
real
care
into
this
and
didnt
cut
cornersi
loved
it
o
i
have
got
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
especially
some
to
send
out
in
trades
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
stone
ve
090909
but
thicker
and
more
chocolatey
very
well
done
saranac
very
well
done
indeed
oas
far
as
imperial
porters
with
orange
go
with
one
does
not
measure
up
to
bbxxiii
it
is
still
a
decent
beer
but
not
as
good
this
was
nowhere
near
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
got
a
bottle
of
this
baltic
porter
from
saranac
perhaps
one
of
the
finest
beers
from
saranac
and
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
soon
again
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
highly
recommended
o
this
is
quite
good
more
stoutlike
in
many
ways
than
a
porter
but
lets
face
it
imperial
porters
and
double
stouts
arent
too
far
apart
especially
once
you
start
adding
extra
ingredients
it
can
become
hard
to
tell
them
apart
this
is
probably
the
highest
rating
ive
ever
given
to
one
of
saranacs
beers
lets
hope
that
with
the
new
bombers
they
continue
to
make
good
stuff
overall
worth
a
try
and
a
good
porter
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
orange
chocolate
myself
so
maybe
others
will
like
more
would
think
this
would
improve
well
with
aging
as
the
hops
tone
down
and
the
beer
mellows
out
