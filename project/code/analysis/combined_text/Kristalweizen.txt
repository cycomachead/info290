this
is
a
style
that
mandates
robust
carbonation
and
this
one
never
gets
there
but
aside
from
that
obvious
mouthfeel
dilemma
the
beer
is
pretty
nice
clean
filtered
here
type
white
wheat
malt
and
a
fruity
yeast
combine
for
a
simple
clean
and
refreshingly
quaffable
brew
certainly
not
at
the
level
of
some
of
the
best
german
and
austrian
examples
of
the
style
but
for
a
small
american
outfit
its
delightful
crispy
finish
just
a
hit
of
banana
and
dryness
to
it
but
i
could
drink
ten
of
these
in
an
afternoon
if
they
were
cold
the
problem
is
it
doesnt
warm
up
well
dropping
what
little
carbonation
it
has
and
getting
heavy
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
a
good
local
craft
brew
worth
drinking
on
your
next
trip
to
billings
works
well
as
a
summer
session
brew
although
grizzly
wulff
wheat
lacks
the
appearance
and
aroma
of
a
well
crafted
beer
it
is
one
of
the
most
thirst
quenching
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
almost
has
a
lemon
soda
quality
to
it
that
would
make
it
perfect
for
those
lazy
long
summer
days
up
around
yellowstone
too
bad
its
retired
now
or
it
would
make
the
perfect
summer
golf
fishing
etc
beer
up
in
montana
this
is
an
interesting
and
very
off
the
wall
beer
i
appreciate
it
but
i
am
not
enamored
by
it
overall
this
is
a
strange
lemony
beer
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
bad
stand
in
elementary
school
this
is
too
tart
too
sour
and
too
puckering
drinkability
skip
it
the
taste
is
a
bitterish
one
with
notes
of
wheat
barley
and
other
grains
as
well
as
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
after
the
carbonation
subsides
nothing
to
write
home
about
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
unoffensive
with
and
uberlight
body
and
a
decent
finish
this
is
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
word
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
again
i
like
the
label
art
from
this
brewery
with
its
flyfishing
theme
and
the
name
of
the
beer
which
was
mentioned
in
another
review
grizzly
wulff
wheat
is
named
after
the
grizzly
wulff
dry
fly
depicted
on
the
label
which
was
invented
by
a
man
named
lee
wulff
unfortunately
thats
the
most
exciting
thing
about
the
beer
it
isnt
much
of
an
austrian
kristall
weizen
hell
it
isnt
even
much
of
an
american
pale
wheat
i
sure
hope
the
rest
of
yellowstone
valley
brewing
companys
lineup
is
more
accomplished
because
im
not
about
to
bite
on
this
one
again
d
i
think
what
throws
people
with
this
beer
is
the
appearance
to
it
looks
like
a
miller
lite
maybe
im
a
little
partial
cause
this
brewery
is
my
regular
hangout
but
i
do
enjoy
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
but
not
a
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
fore
is
light
and
crisp
with
carbonation
malty
and
even
slightly
bready
extremely
low
intensity
bannana
notes
but
overall
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
which
makes
the
beer
quite
unmemorable
bottle
obtained
from
a
local
liquor
store
and
consumed
a
couple
evenings
later
in
august
2005
pours
a
two
finger
white
tan
head
over
a
cloudy
peach
yelloworange
liquid
the
yeast
were
dumped
into
the
glass
smells
pinesol
citrusy
hops
with
some
apricot
and
caramel
tastes
potently
green
apple
sour
with
pineapple
citrus
pine
and
a
spicy
zing
the
sour
has
a
perfumy
candle
character
about
it
cant
tell
if
there
is
any
hop
bitter
or
clove
because
the
sour
is
so
potent
wet
sweet
with
a
tart
finish
moderate
acrid
carbonation
forms
tiny
stingers
on
my
tongue
but
the
head
is
completely
gone
by
appearance
this
could
be
a
flat
twoday
old
beer
drinkability
quenched
my
thirst
at
the
time
i
would
agree
with
the
american
wheat
or
even
the
krisal
but
not
a
true
hefe
worth
a
try
though
this
brew
has
the
faint
aroma
of
yellowstones
other
light
brews
brought
back
from
yellowstone
i
will
keep
this
short
because
there
is
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
one
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
nice
micro
wheat
the
taste
is
a
little
sharp
and
tangy
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
i
like
my
wheats
a
little
crisper
than
this
one
gave
out
there
was
a
nice
amount
of
light
carbonation
off
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
taste
of
lemon
grass
is
very
evident
decent
beer
but
boring
when
you
have
a
fridge
full
of
other
choices
upon
my
initial
sip
the
beer
felt
like
it
foamed
up
in
my
mouth
like
how
warm
soda
does
excessively
carbonated
almost
bringing
tears
to
your
eyes
a
very
tingly
mouthfeel
with
a
sourness
overriding
a
mild
soft
wheat
maltiness
a
dryish
finish
without
much
to
the
flavor
besides
a
lemon
juice
citric
acidity
not
very
good
and
the
oxodization
doesnt
help
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
the
nose
was
a
sort
of
wheatygo
figureive
got
to
work
on
my
descriptors
malt
it
tasted
of
nondescript
malt
and
an
even
milder
unassertive
hoppiness
this
is
a
mild
nonconfrontational
easy
swilling
wheat
with
little
character
i
think
it
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
and
you
might
be
able
to
use
is
as
a
transitional
beer
for
the
macroswillers
source
beers
across
america
this
filtered
wheat
ale
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
aroma
is
one
of
a
wheat
ale
coupled
with
a
hard
apple
cider
the
light
sweet
flavor
also
has
a
cidery
quality
to
it
and
a
mild
yeast
presence
which
makes
for
quite
a
refreshing
beer
the
finish
is
light
and
clean
quite
enjoyable
much
to
my
liking
when
my
mail
order
beer
came
on
this
hot
humid
southern
day
it
was
a
wheat
which
i
especially
enjoy
on
days
like
this
after
getting
it
cold
and
pouring
it
it
had
a
nice
golden
color
and
a
nice
even
head
even
though
i
prefer
my
wheats
unfiltered
it
had
a
good
appearance
the
aroma
wasnt
strong
but
had
a
refreshing
scent
to
it
had
a
good
mothfeel
to
it
and
went
down
way
to
smooth
i
was
kicking
myself
for
not
chilling
more
than
one
i
recommend
this
beer
its
a
keeper
cheers
NA
bottle
pictured
here
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
a
pale
yellow
amber
with
copious
quickbreaking
white
bubbles
aroma
is
the
expected
banana
and
clove
elements
albeit
much
dialed
down
compared
to
unfiltered
exemplars
of
the
style
nice
old
world
wheat
malt
undercurrent
flavor
is
similarly
subtle
yet
reasonably
complex
neutered
clove
pervades
the
proceedings
but
is
trumped
by
sparkling
pineapple
orange
and
bubble
gum
notes
a
pleasant
dry
wheat
spiciness
lurks
in
the
background
along
with
a
light
caramel
sweetness
light
bodied
and
super
fizzy
wellcrafted
but
leaves
me
wanting
the
full
meal
deal
there
is
really
no
need
to
filter
this
style
and
the
relative
lack
of
yeast
character
looms
too
large
to
ignore
both
times
ive
had
this
beer
ive
found
it
quite
enjoyable
but
much
like
the
majority
of
kristalweizens
that
ive
tried
id
probably
go
with
the
hefeweizen
version
if
it
was
available
the
only
reason
i
didnt
in
this
case
was
because
of
how
easy
the
hefe
is
to
get
a
hold
on
in
the
uk
but
ive
yet
to
come
across
the
kristalweizen
version
at
home
refreshing
taste
not
very
sweet
it
has
a
zesty
flavor
mildly
bitter
you
can
feel
its
hops
and
with
some
species
even
though
was
filtered
you
can
still
taste
the
yeast
harmonious
ending
a
little
dry
definitely
a
top
notch
weissbier
extremely
well
balanced
and
still
off
the
beaten
path
really
liked
this
beer
o
average
not
too
exciting
but
i
know
i
prefer
hefeweizens
over
kristalweizens
as
i
said
if
you
want
something
like
this
you
might
just
as
well
pick
a
plain
lager
of
some
kind
the
wheat
character
is
there
but
this
drink
should
be
much
more
exciting
this
is
one
of
the
better
german
weißbeers
that
you
can
get
on
the
market
a
decent
kristallweizen
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
its
flavour
is
much
stronger
if
compared
to
other
filtered
weizen
beers
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
or
at
least
a
dont
like
the
style
feel
like
light
soda
to
me
if
you
havent
had
a
weizen
beer
this
could
be
afirst
one
so
you
understand
the
difference
among
malts
o
average
beer
good
in
the
summer
to
cool
yourself
i
prefer
the
hefeweizenstyle
though
d
it
started
really
nice
but
turned
weak
on
me
drinkability
very
drinkable
good
drink
for
a
hot
day
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
pale
filtered
wheat
beer
kristalweizen
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
highly
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
but
its
not
very
interesting
its
just
too
polished
its
a
bit
unidimensional
and
the
flavors
lack
depth
and
are
presented
in
a
too
orderly
fashion
for
someone
who
thinks
a
hefeweizen
is
too
powerful
this
one
might
be
recommended
though
since
its
basically
a
hefe
light
overall
i
dont
really
understand
or
agree
with
the
idea
of
filtering
a
wheat
beer
but
if
you
want
a
light
beer
with
the
flavor
of
a
wheat
beer
give
this
a
try
d
a
ok
kristallweizen
a
little
thin
and
lacking
in
refreshment
but
overall
drinkable
like
the
paulaner
hefe
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
if
i
had
to
choose
between
them
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
great
if
you
want
a
lighter
beer
and
still
want
the
wheat
beer
flavor
good
ok
i
admit
it
i
have
never
really
understood
what
the
point
in
a
kristal
weizen
is
the
hefe
weizens
are
so
much
more
interesting
salud
dry
overall
but
refreashing
also
the
aromas
come
out
in
the
flavour
too
so
banana
and
vanilla
hit
your
mouth
in
waves
these
tastes
stay
in
the
mouthfeel
and
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
imho
kristallweizen
person
however
he
would
probably
like
this
one
taste
of
wheat
with
typical
fenolic
yeast
profile
ripe
bananas
i
did
not
taste
a
lot
of
clove
though
unlike
any
other
weizen
this
has
a
slight
bitterness
which
fits
this
beer
the
sweetness
in
the
smell
is
not
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
rather
dry
and
has
a
fenolic
aftertaste
i
miss
the
extra
taste
that
the
yeast
normally
adds
to
a
weizen
it
seems
to
always
add
an
extra
taste
and
mouthfeel
500
ml
bottle
at
cardinal
stavanger
abv
is
5
2
pale
yellow
colour
crystal
clear
like
the
name
says
large
to
moderate
head
typical
weissbier
aroma
fruity
with
bananas
and
cloves
but
the
the
aroma
is
not
as
strong
as
youll
get
from
a
hefew
crisp
and
spritzy
mouthfeel
moderate
cloves
and
tolerable
hops
in
the
flavour
but
boring
compared
to
the
hefe
why
filter
away
the
goodies
short
aftertaste
with
this
beer
i
would
have
to
rate
it
as
one
of
the
top
weizen
i
have
tasted
the
filtering
suprisingly
had
no
effect
besides
the
fact
that
it
was
easier
to
pour
the
look
was
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
strong
bannana
aroma
but
not
overpowering
to
turn
you
away
the
taste
was
bursting
with
different
flavors
with
bannana
barely
noticeable
one
thing
you
will
notice
is
that
atleast
in
my
opinion
weizen
beers
feel
the
best
in
your
mouth
and
going
down
your
taste
pallat
with
this
particular
selection
being
no
different
with
only
one
downfall
to
drinking
weizen
beers
i
would
recomend
this
on
highly
for
a
strong
wheat
beer
taste
oh
ya
that
downfall
is
you
get
extremely
bloated
if
you
have
more
than
three
or
four
of
these
or
any
weizen
beer
so
be
prepared
to
have
other
beers
in
the
fridge
and
remember
you
better
pick
something
that
you
really
like
because
as
you
will
learn
in
wine
tasting
you
start
with
the
low
quality
and
only
work
up
so
please
dont
torcher
your
taste
buds
after
this
fine
german
wheat
beer
a
foamy
head
fades
into
a
fine
white
collar
on
an
almost
transparent
yellow
golden
body
the
smell
shows
wheat
and
some
roasted
malts
with
light
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
is
of
wheat
slightly
citric
iodated
and
i
thought
it
lacked
a
sweeter
note
the
mouthfeel
is
very
round
and
ends
in
a
dry
way
theres
an
impression
of
banana
and
grapefruit
mixed
together
but
more
with
the
citrus
of
the
grapefruit
than
with
the
sweetness
of
the
banana
hops
are
faintly
noticeable
but
they
contribute
to
the
dryness
of
the
finish
in
a
decent
but
not
great
manner
its
still
a
quite
drinkable
brew
but
it
seems
that
it
could
be
improved
easily
extremely
interesting
thirst
quenching
and
flavor
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
agree
with
duece
filtered
is
not
better
less
flavorful
and
complex
than
traditional
wheat
beers
no
nuance
overall
its
a
decent
beer
and
one
that
just
may
take
me
back
to
where
i
think
my
heart
yearns
to
be
lower
abv
than
im
accustomed
to
lately
with
all
the
belgiums
and
trippels
but
theres
always
whiskey
right
overall
awesome
crystal
wheat
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
had
will
buy
again
very
refreshing
their
regular
hefe
and
dunkel
are
average
this
one
is
superb
o
not
usually
a
weizen
fan
but
this
one
is
actually
pretty
good
great
for
a
warm
latesummer
day
very
nice
revisited
in
july
2013
o
not
great
but
above
average
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
but
for
the
kristalweizen
style
this
might
be
the
best
one
that
ive
found
so
far
well
worth
the
wait
nice
rocky
white
head
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
smell
is
of
banana
raisin
fruitcake
co2
super
light
refreshing
and
smooth
on
the
palate
really
cool
and
sparkly
very
mild
and
satisfying
finish
with
a
thirst
quenching
light
mouthfeel
excellent
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
perfect
stepping
off
point
for
a
regular
beer
drinker
it
has
all
of
the
good
points
and
none
of
the
bad
of
your
everyday
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
kristall
weizen
and
would
recommend
it
perfect
for
the
end
of
a
summers
day
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
white
foam
head
smells
mostly
of
cloves
tastes
good
light
on
flavor
cloves
no
off
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
high
drinkability
just
a
cut
below
the
weihenstephaner
kristallweis
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
banana
and
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
of
wheat
spices
yeast
and
subtle
banana
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
somewhat
subtle
had
this
one
right
before
having
the
dunkel
weizen
i
didnt
care
for
it
much
definatley
a
better
taste
then
american
made
weizens
to
me
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
apperance
and
smell
were
very
good
i
had
to
try
it
though
and
it
wasnt
the
worst
of
course
but
probably
would
try
it
again
sometime
down
the
road
surprisingly
very
good
definitely
drinkable
enjoyable
would
seek
out
and
have
again
pours
a
clear
gold
body
with
a
big
white
head
that
is
very
frumpy
and
longlasting
and
laces
the
glass
in
puffy
clumps
aromas
are
very
subdued
i
get
some
sweet
wheat
and
general
graininess
but
not
much
else
besides
some
light
bananas
and
cloves
the
banana
and
cloves
express
themselves
more
distinctly
on
the
palate
which
is
sweet
up
front
before
leading
to
a
very
chalky
finish
with
an
unusual
texture
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
one
well
worth
investigating
to
see
if
one
of
its
challenging
corners
is
particularly
appealing
to
you
m
the
beginning
is
neutral
balanced
with
some
tending
to
sweet
as
per
the
style
changing
a
little
at
the
end
to
a
faint
bittersweetness
drinkability
it
is
a
good
brew
but
i
am
not
too
impressed
on
the
spectrum
of
bavarian
wheat
beers
it
probably
falls
smack
dab
in
the
middle
which
is
still
saying
a
lot
few
american
wheats
have
this
much
character
and
i
hang
my
head
in
shame
t
very
nice
wheat
flavour
crisp
on
tongue
complex
and
balanced
among
sweetness
citrusy
and
bitterness
mediumlight
body
semi
dry
finish
this
beer
is
probably
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
highly
recommended
o
this
is
more
flavorful
than
expected
and
is
delightfully
light
and
delicious
overall
about
average
for
a
kristalweizen
and
when
tried
sidebyside
with
tuchers
underpowered
hefe
i
preferred
actually
this
poured
from
bottle
into
weizen
glass
pilsner
yellow
clear
w
a
huge
rocky
head
of
medium
bubbles
that
leaves
big
patchy
blotches
of
lace
nose
is
fruity
and
spicy
mild
banana
predominates
w
a
hint
of
allspice
or
clove
the
flavor
here
is
a
little
watered
down
w
a
hint
of
tartness
and
alight
banana
cream
flavor
being
just
about
all
this
has
to
off
lack
of
off
flavors
and
brisk
enough
carbonation
keep
it
quaffable
which
is
i
guess
pretty
much
what
you
want
out
of
a
kristall
a
clear
yelloworange
pour
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
has
banana
cloves
and
some
bread
the
light
body
has
a
slightly
thin
texture
with
average
carbonation
the
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
only
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
right
before
the
finish
this
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
warm
days
drinkability
drinkable
but
not
really
enjoyable
weihenstephaner
has
a
much
better
example
of
this
style
o
nice
wheat
beer
here
the
nose
was
a
little
offputting
but
a
nice
flavor
this
is
my
first
kristallweizen
and
i
like
it
wouldnt
mind
some
more
wheatness
though
poured
a
medium
sparkling
clear
amber
with
a
large
white
rocky
head
that
was
fully
diminishing
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
with
yeast
a
mild
herbal
hop
and
a
straw
malt
with
a
slight
note
of
banana
and
clove
it
tasted
midly
bitter
yet
very
smooth
at
first
and
finished
with
a
nice
yeast
flavor
with
just
an
ever
so
slight
hint
of
banana
that
stayed
with
you
only
a
short
time
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
yet
creamy
in
texture
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
refreshing
brew
a
really
drinkable
hefe
i
will
drink
this
whenever
i
see
it
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
i
hope
that
i
get
more
of
tuchers
offerings
soon
besides
the
dunkles
i
bought
the
same
day
big
head
three
fingers
of
white
foam
taking
a
good
three
minutes
to
subside
lace
for
days
clinging
from
the
top
of
the
glass
to
the
liquid
color
is
a
3
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
started
hazy
but
cleared
in
a
few
minutes
such
flavor
in
such
a
light
colored
beer
smells
like
lots
of
malt
roasted
wheat
and
oats
and
some
hops
taste
is
great
well
balanced
flavors
of
malt
citrus
wheat
barley
corn
vanilla
and
pepper
lots
of
body
in
my
mouth
not
easy
on
the
wallet
but
great
for
the
price
shell
out
the
green
for
this
one
this
beer
has
a
light
gold
appearance
to
it
the
smell
is
a
very
fruity
almost
banana
smell
the
taste
is
a
very
sweet
but
enjoyable
applebanana
taste
its
almost
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
amazing
i
wish
it
was
never
ending
personally
as
for
drinlability
i
find
it
hard
to
do
this
beer
gave
me
terrible
burps
and
i
was
unable
to
get
rid
of
them
one
or
two
of
these
and
i
could
honestly
say
i
wouldnt
wanna
drink
anymore
because
my
stomach
would
feel
a
little
bloated
with
that
being
said
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
i
poured
this
into
my
wheat
glass
from
a
500ml
bottle
it
poured
out
with
a
creamy
white
head
much
like
the
natural
helles
weizen
except
this
is
in
fact
crystal
clear
it
is
a
golden
straw
color
with
plenty
of
evervecent
bubbles
smells
slightly
of
bananas
and
grain
tastes
like
a
sweet
banana
bread
much
like
the
natural
weizen
and
of
a
fruity
wheat
mix
this
beer
is
a
little
dryer
than
the
natural
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
and
bubbly
drinkability
is
good
but
i
prefer
the
natural
weizen
over
this
however
this
beer
is
solid
d
this
beer
is
really
nothing
without
all
the
yeast
character
that
its
cloudy
cousin
has
it
is
a
bit
bland
without
much
character
taste
at
first
there
is
the
nice
banana
flavor
that
is
followed
by
some
spices
giving
it
that
banana
bread
flavor
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
but
then
goes
away
leaving
not
much
of
a
lingering
taste
which
i
sometimes
prefer
d
great
drinker
and
great
stuff
a
gratifying
beer
high
marks
drinkability
this
is
a
great
hefe
i
will
be
drinking
it
regularly
im
still
fresh
to
the
style
but
this
one
seems
like
a
good
example
and
is
a
pretty
tasty
refreshing
beer
i
cant
say
that
this
beer
will
ever
make
a
top
ten
list
but
its
certainly
worth
the
moderate
price
a
good
value
and
tasty
little
brew
pours
to
a
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
left
decent
lacing
nose
is
a
light
mixture
of
wheat
yeast
floral
and
a
hint
of
bubblegum
mouthfeel
is
muted
and
only
slightly
tingly
taste
is
har
dto
pick
up
as
nothing
from
the
nose
really
stands
out
finsih
while
pleasant
is
fairly
nondescript
although
the
beer
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
a
solid
effort
and
i
was
happy
that
bananas
were
not
a
dominating
flavor
aroma
is
fairly
strong
yeasty
and
wheaty
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
it
pours
a
rather
wan
clear
yellow
but
at
least
it
has
a
fairly
thick
and
persistent
white
head
flavor
is
typical
for
a
wheat
beer
yeasty
and
a
little
thick
with
more
than
a
hint
of
lemon
pleasant
if
not
outstanding
texture
is
smooth
and
refreshing
and
a
little
tingly
if
you
have
a
dog
sit
on
your
porch
in
july
and
watch
it
hunt
a
squirrel
while
you
sip
this
out
of
a
giant
mug
i
promise
you
thats
what
gods
doing
at
the
exact
same
time
drinkable
like
a
good
glass
of
water
i
would
seek
this
out
on
a
extremely
hot
and
humid
day
where
you
want
to
alternate
between
beer
and
hidration
d
this
is
almost
too
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
little
less
flavorful
than
their
regular
hefeweizen
but
this
is
still
pretty
delicious
and
enjoyable
much
cleaner
and
more
easily
drinkable
than
most
hefeweizens
this
would
be
an
even
better
introductory
beer
for
macro
drinkers
than
the
standard
unfiltered
version
my
first
filtered
hefe
im
impressed
by
the
crisp
drinkability
of
this
style
d
goes
down
easily
though
id
like
some
more
flavor
the
appearance
and
aroma
didnt
suffer
noticeably
from
the
lack
of
included
yeast
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
did
a
bit
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
hefeweizens
if
im
craving
a
light
weizen
drinkability
the
light
floral
flavors
do
not
really
move
me
but
that
is
probably
a
comment
on
the
style
more
than
this
one
in
particular
a
solid
brew
but
not
one
that
i
am
really
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
d
very
enjoyable
a
filtered
hefeweizen
pours
a
golden
color
that
is
clear
maybe
a
shade
on
the
lighter
side
massive
head
that
goes
down
slow
an
unevenly
smell
is
a
classic
malt
liquor
that
is
not
weak
but
not
extreme
either
taste
is
a
little
watered
down
malt
liquor
about
the
same
after
taste
of
a
classic
malt
liquor
and
as
drinkable
as
a
classic
malt
liquor
verdict
if
you
have
never
tried
malt
liquor
or
rarely
drink
it
it
would
be
a
tossup
between
this
and
the
bull
for
a
classic
malt
liquor
taste
nothing
special
from
a
quality
brewer
but
beats
most
of
the
mass
producers
runoff
drinkability
easy
to
drink
although
i
wanted
a
bit
more
still
worth
it
i
keep
thinking
bright
as
i
drink
this
its
an
assuming
crisp
clean
clear
flavorful
beer
and
one
that
is
immensely
drinkable
would
love
to
check
out
more
variations
on
this
style
and
would
love
to
see
more
craftlevel
u
s
brewers
give
kristalweizens
a
shot
drinkability
is
excellent
get
a
pint
of
this
for
sitting
with
friends
and
enjoying
a
laugh
as
this
will
satisfy
any
night
on
the
town
overall
i
am
glad
i
bought
this
but
weihenstephaner
is
a
superior
beer
bottle
from
the
vacaville
bevmo
pours
a
strawlike
yellow
brown
with
a
huge
2
inch
head
excellent
clarity
and
sticky
rorschach
test
lacing
bready
malt
odor
with
hints
of
banana
and
tangy
fruit
some
ethanol
also
evident
flavor
is
a
bit
more
tangy
and
bananay
than
the
odor
lets
on
banana
mixes
with
a
nice
soft
malt
body
for
a
nice
light
easydrinking
experience
hint
of
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
on
the
finish
with
more
banana
light
to
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
not
bad
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
style
i
anticipate
making
a
habit
of
much
of
the
complexities
of
a
hefe
are
lost
here
making
this
almost
like
a
lager
i
guess
wheat
is
more
holy
than
corn
poured

pilsner

a
light

and
kind
of

with

drinkable
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
too
bad
its
january
not
a
big
fan
of
light
beers
but
this
is
excellent
pours

ultra
clear

amber
with
billowy
dense
white
and
long
lasting

sweet
pale

salty

a

and
a

soft

quite

over

certainly

though
drinkability
is
high
its
definitely
sessionable
and
pleasant
flavor
is
fine
but
very
mild
which
is
what
makes
it
so
drinkable
d
kind
of
a
letwdown
after
their
regular
hefe
was
so
good
no
problem
drinking
it
just
is
pedestrian
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
uneven
in
my
eyes
the
taste
simply
didnt
do
a
thing
for
me
in
the
least
but
there
were
other
elements
that
made
it
halfway
decent
drinkability
a
their
beers
are
good
that
i
know
of
over
all
a
nice
beer
but
it
doesnt
grab
my
attention
and
win
my
heart
with
so
many
other
great
beers
out
there
especially
with
similar
characteristics
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
one
out
again
d
farily
good
for
a
light
wheat
beer
even
on
hot
days
i
prefer
the
full
weiss
with
all
of
its
bananas
and
cloudy
yeasty
nature
a
good
wheat
starter
for
those
who
think
the
elder
brother
is
too
pungent
sometime
nyc
area
will
have
this
availablehint
hint
overall
this
was
a
super
refreshing
beer
that
really
outshines
many
others
in
this
category
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
big
billowing
white
head
that
has
good
retention
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
of
banana
cloves
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
great
it
starts
with
some
cloves
but
has
this
sweet
fruit
flavor
that
really
surprised
me
finishes
clean
without
the
graininess
i
often
sense
in
weizens
has
a
light
body
with
a
low
carbonation
that
gives
a
nice
smooth
coating
to
the
mouth
a
great
tasting
wiezen
and
a
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
summer
long
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
i
picked
this
one
up
blindly
without
knowing
what
to
expect
and
was
surprised
at
how
good
it
was
definitely
would
recommend
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
wheat
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
weissbiers
that
i
have
had
and
easily
the
best
krystal
when
i
usually
think
of
kristall
weizens
i
think
of
american
pale
wheat
ales
but
better
as
this
beer
opens
a
good
healthy
dose
of
pilsner
malts
medium
wheat
aromas
and
flavors
and
a
mild
hint
of
grain
flavor
while
the
esters
phenolics
and
overall
strong
yeast
character
is
timid
the
bready
malty
notes
shine
the
beer
isnt
without
all
esters
though
i
get
a
nice
lemon
character
followed
up
by
a
peppery
bubblegummy
note
that
gives
a
lot
of
variety
to
the
beer
the
filtering
does
strip
much
viscocity
from
the
beer
making
it
less
creamy
and
full
but
does
make
for
a
beer
that
is
easier
to
drink
without
bloating
finishes
quite
clean
but
with
a
light
grain
wheat
blend
and
a
lingering
lemon
flavor
nice
beer
d
a
nice
almost
watery
hefe
for
those
who
prefer
the
lower
sugar
content
and
lighter
body
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
in
the
future
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
but
it
strikes
a
good
balance
between
a
light
lager
and
an
actual
hefeweizen
dunkels
are
my
thing
but
this
kristall
weizen
was
certainly
something
different
had
it
well
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
kristall
clear
peircing
golden
color
that
shined
nicely
aroma
was
robust
with
wheat
peach
and
some
banana
taste
was
really
clean
and
crisp
not
that
tart
yeast
taste
you
get
in
a
lot
of
hefes
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
a
beer
with
few
flaws
decent
flavor
and
high
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
all
day
in
the
summer
well
all
year
where
i
live
popped
this
one
on
this
lovely
daybefore
the
start
of
spring
to
celebrate
acceptance
to
culinary
school
pours
out
an
actively
foamy
head
caps
a
strawlike
brew
looks
like
a
very
foamy
pils
as
kristalweiss
should
aromas
are
extremly
light
faint
straw
faint
wheat
tiniest
touch
of
cloves
and
then
banana
flavor
is
walnutlike
in
its
delicacy
slight
nuttiness
finish
of
grassy
wheats
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
i
was
served
this
type
of
beer
in
germany
garnished
with
a
lemonamerican
heresy
the
flavors
of
this
bier
are
very
light
subdued
and
mellow
as
it
was
designed
to
be
ive
had
better
offerings
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
solid
example
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
will
not
knock
you
off
your
feet
but
is
a
nice
good
brew
the
best
way
to
summarize
this
beer
is
hefeweisse
collides
with
a
pilsiner
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
huge
dense
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
leaving
plenty
of
chunk
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
clove
and
wheat
malt
with
some
light
banana
the
taste
is
light
their
hefe
taste
was
light
and
this
follows
course
the
taste
has
light
wheat
characteristics
some
phenols
has
more
of
a
grainy
type
presence
the
feel
is
light
and
almost
watery
with
prickly
carbonation
finishes
quite
neutral
rather
bland
but
does
have
some
nice
hefe
characteristics
very
drinkable
and
quite
good
but
doesnt
compare
to
weihenstephaner
kristallweissbier
prost
d
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
hefe
the
clearness
of
it
through
me
for
a
little
bit
but
overall
i
felt
it
added
a
lot
to
it
being
much
lighter
and
crisper
all
around
it
went
very
well
with
dinner
as
it
did
not
fill
you
up
anymore
then
you
needed
to
be
again
a
good
little
sessionable
german
that
is
a
definite
to
give
a
try
if
you
see
it
it
will
surely
not
disappoint
if
the
style
is
what
are
you
are
going
for
overall
a
good
german
kristall
weizen
which
i
am
guessing
to
be
a
filtered
hefe
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
good
summer
drinker
worth
a
try
but
not
really
something
id
stock
up
on
unless
i
could
find
it
for
a
good
case
price
d
very
good
i
dont
see
much
difference
from
their
hefe
weizen
da
quite
decent
kristalweisen
would
not
likely
buy
again
due
to
weinstephaner
kristalweisen
being
just
as
accessible
to
me
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
drink
if
offered
to
me
again

with
a

aroma
is
of

and
cloves
with
some
yeastiness
as
expected
crisp
and
clean
with
the
usual
clove
and
banana
flavors
present
and
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
let
you
know
they
are
there
my
first
kristal

and
definately
not
my
last
lingering
powdery
wheat
taste
drinkability
on
the
whole
i
think
i
prefer
erdingers
kristal

accessible
for
sure
a
touch
disappointing
though
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
d
light
and
easy
these
would
go
down
very
quick
overall
i
never
had
this
style
before
but
everything
seems
to
be
on
par
with
what
ive
read
the
yeasty
finish
is
killer

aroma
is

as
expected
quite
crisp
clove
and
banana
are
present
as
are
some
hops
toward
the
end
also
seems
to
be
a
somewhat
metallic
taste
too
although
its
not
really
too
distracting
pretty
good
worth
a
try
for
sure
yeah
its
dry
but
we
expect
richer
taste
from
bavarian
weizen
pours
into
a
weizen
glass
with
the
typical
large
head
of
a
wheat
beer
clear
straw
yellow
with
rising
champagneesque
carbonation
a
standard
yeastlow
hops
aroma
yet
this
is
quite
fruity
even
though
the
yeasts
that
gave
that
flavor
are
long
gone
quite
rerfeshing
a
big
let
down
after
the
pour
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
special
in
any
way
and
a
little
off
i
found
this
to
pour
very
well
it
is
very
clean
for
a
weizen
guess
thats
why
they
call
it
kristall
it
does
have
a
fruity
almost
sweet
smell
i
like
the
overall
taste
but
it
is
not
quite
as
flavorable
as
other
weiss
beers
like
most
hefes
i
dont
know
if
that
has
to
do
with
the
clear
nature
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
very
light
and
crisp
it
goes
down
smooth
i
find
the
drinkability
to
be
very
high
this
is
a
lighter
beer
not
filling
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
find
other
weiss
beers
weizens
to
have
more
flavor
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
drinkabilty
is
good
very
subtle
flavors
but
by
no
means
flavorless
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
brauerei
tucher
brau
i
had
despaired
of
ever
finding
a
version
of
the
krystal
weizen
style
that
appeals
to
me
but
this
one
most
certainly
does
ill
still
grab
a
quality
hefe
weizen
every
time
but
its
nice
to
know
that
if
i
ever
develop
a
yeast
sensitivity
theres
a
wonderful
beer
available
that
is
a
more
than
worthy
substitute
tasted
medium
rare
banana
bread
a
level
of
bitterness
seeps
its
way
into
the
drink
towards
the
end
it
just
rolls
around
perfectly
on
the
palate
mild
carbonation
but
present
enough
to
get
the
job
done
i
was
in
the
mood
for
another
tall
bottle
of
this
as
soon
as
i
finished
so
its
gotta
have
some
drinkability
pleasantly
surprised
john
w
bham
uk
drinkability
a
nice
example
of
the
style
if
this
is
the
type
of
thing
you
like
i
think
i
have
found
a
favorite
weizen
i
usually
go
for
the
cloudy
funky
ones
but
filtered
or
not
this
one
has
what
i
want
must
keep
this
in
stock
in
the
fridge
i
worried
at
first
that
i
might
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
as
great
spirits
doesnt
seem
to
do
a
lot
of
business
in
singles
but
i
couldnt
taste
any
skunk
to
this
beer
and
i
think
that
it
tasted
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
taste
i
think
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
if
i
have
the
opportunity
to
try
a
few
more
kristals
in
the
coming
weeks
my
liquor
store
only
carries
this
one
i
will
see
if
my
opinion
changes
and
possibly
rereview
otherwise
i
must
give
a
largely
negative
review
to
this
beer
i
bought
a
bottle
of
this
simply
due
to
my
experience
the
previous
evening
with
the
hefe
i
was
stuck
in
something
close
to
beer
hell
orlando
well
this
beer
was
barely
better
than
nothing
the
beer
had
a
typical
golden
appearance
with
a
minimal
head
the
aroma
was
also
virtually
nonexistent
the
taste
was
more
pils
than
weizen
with
a
slight
sharpness
that
reminded
me
of
sterling
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
average
and
the
beer
was
very
well
carbonated
the
drinkability
was
a
little
less
than
average
i
struggled
to
finish
one
and
i
dont
plan
on
buying
another
i
also
dont
plan
on
returning
to
the
home
of
the
giant
rat
any
time
soon
either
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
huge
billowing
head
that
falls
to
about
3
fingers
after
a
while
then
to
a
finger
hen
letting
it
sit
the
nose
is
slightly
wheaty
slightly
banana
sweet
with
a
hint
of
lemony
citrus
nice
the
flavor
is
right
there
with
a
slight
banana
slight
lemon
the
wheat
is
not
quite
so
strong
the
feel
is
the
very
light
side
of
moderate
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
nice
example
of
a
kristal
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
banana
sweetness
is
nice
and
the
citrusy
lemony
is
good
as
well
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
brilliant
clear
gold
with
a
thick
full
white
head
it
sure
is
a
beautiful
looking
glass
of
beer
the
clarity
indicates
the
beer
has
been
filtered
and
this
lack
of
yeast
softens
the
rest
of
the
beers
character
the
nose
still
has
bits
of
clove
banana
and
vanilla
but
less
than
i
detect
in
a
beer
mit
weizen
the
same
is
true
for
the
taste
cloves
banana
more
vanilla
and
just
a
hint
of
orange
come
across
but
it
is
a
much
lighter
flavor
than
the
unfiltered
light
and
smooth
mouth
feel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
cant
image
a
better
style
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
evening
nice
mouthfeel
not
thin
i
could
see
quaffing
these
on
a
warm
day
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
would
the
right
thjing
to
serve
at
a
summer
picnic
overall
the
second
of
the
tucher
brews
that
i
have
tried
both
have
been
solid
offerings
the
kristall
weizen
is
worth
a
try
and
is
a
good
above
average
brew
overall
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
another
good
effort
by
tucher
pretty
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
nice
thirstquencher
very
good
drinkable
beer
made
to
consumed
by
the
liter
in
a
german
beer
hall
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
reminds
you
of
why
germans
are
considered
some
of
the
best
brewers
out
there
their
dunkel
hefeweizen
is
one
to
try
but
this
one
is
one
to
be
avoided
a
great
beer
for
food
the
dry
tart
flavor
really
cleans
the
palette
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
most
other
german
wheat
beers
but
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
just
a
tiny
trace
amount
of
banana
and
a
moderate
amount
of
clovelike
spice
there
was
a
light
to
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
this
lack
of
carbonation
combined
with
the
great
taste
of
this
brew
as
well
as
its
smoothness
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
it
didnt
seem
tremendously
filling
i
feel
i
could
down
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
you
like
german
wheat
beer
you
should
really
give
this
one
a
go
when
poured
it
was
a
clear
medium
yellow
with
a
lot
of
white
foam
and
lace
on
the
glass
from
first
sip
to
last
gulp
the
smell
of
spice
filled
the
nose
with
the
aroma
of
a
yeasty
nature
the
taste
like
the
smell
was
of
a
spicyyeasty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
cloves
nice
after
taste
but
lacking
intensity
on
the
flavor
staw
colored
with
a
huge
white
cap
of
foam
aroma
is
subtle
maly
and
fruity
fewer
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
this
beer
stands
on
its
malt
typical
wheat
flavor
but
lacking
the
pronounced
fruitiness
bannana
makes
an
understated
appearance
with
a
slightly
spicy
hop
finish
thin
body
great
drinking
beer
if
not
very
complex
or
interesting
this
is
a
clear
case
no
pun
intended
where
the
kristal
is
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
hefe
this
one
justs
falls
flat
almost
literally
thin
almost
watery
nowhere
near
the
flavor
of

the

as
a

very
grainy

the
flavor
is
that
of
a
wheat
beer
with
some
added
spices
for
a
little
extra
flavor
if
youre
a
fan
of
weiss
beers
you
should
try
this
one
my
favorite
kristall

i

half

white
head
that
stayed
for

strong
lacing
throughout
very
light

smell
with
a
hint
of

the
taste
was
fruity
with
a
definite
clove
sense
that
grew
stronger
very
smooth
and
creamy
texture
that
imparted
a
peppery
bite
after
the
cloves
attractive
packaging
in
amber
glass
this
beer
had
a
great
fluffy
and
rocky
head
for
a
krystal
the
color
was
a
straw
clear
yellow
nose
was
light
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
the
taste
was
nice
and
clean
with
some
sweet
wheaty
flavor
and
mild
floral
backround
very
light
and
refreshing
to
the
palate
but
had
a
good
body
for
this
style
of
beer
every
masss
produced
american
beer
could
learn
a
lesson
that
a
beer
this
light
can
have
good
delicate
flavors
and
a
richer
mouth
feel
not
a
watered
down
flavor
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
in
the
summer
and
dead
of
winter
for
that
matter
clear
darker
gold
color
with
a
few
very
large
flakes
floating
around
huge
foamy
head
that
stays
ample
carbonation
produces
lots
of
foamy
lace
too
clean
aroma
of
wheat
malt
and
yeast
tastes
of
very
clean
wheat
malt
flavors
with
the
slight
obligatory
cloves
and
slight
fruit
a
little
higher
hop
bitterness
than
regular
hefes
very
easy
drinking
making
for
high
drinkability
im
in
the
camp
that
likes
their
wheat
brews
thick
and
rich
with
lots
of
creamy
smoothness
these
krystal
brews
seem
like
the
light
beers
of
the
wheat
style
very
good
anyway
m
first
stab
at
this
style
seems
like
a
dumbed
down
hefe
with
less
flavor
decent
banana
nose
with
some
cloves
pours
gold
pretty
clear
nice
foamy
white
lace
that
rims
the
glass
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
as
jazzed
up
as
some
hefes
taste
is
banana
mainly
with
a
real
clean
crisp
finish
almost
lagerish
maybe
it
is
im
not
real
versed
on
this
style
decent
but
doesnt
pack
enough
punch
in
the
flavor
department
for
my
liking
i
like
it
but
prefer
a
good
hefe
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
and
formed
a
nice
huge
sudsy
white
head
that
left
some
lace
as
it
subsided
a
bit
of
carbonation
present
the
aroma
was
of
banana
and
clove
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
some
spice
the
finish
was
a
little
bready
yet
sprite
due
in
part
to
the
carbonation
an
interesting
twist
on
the
wheat
beer
style
i
rather
like
it
i
dig
this
style
because
it
removes
the
heavy
sickening
yeast
flavour
form
a
perfectly
good
wheat
beer
try
this
out
even
if
you
do
not
like
wheat
brew
it
just
may
change
your
mind
cheers
i
like
the
hefes
a
little
better
than
the
kristal
versions
the
appearance
is
very
nice
yellow
to
golden
color
the
head
was
huge
bad
pour
maybe
tasted
nice
enough
i
had
it
both
on
tap
and
bottle
the
bottle
has
a
little
more
of
the
stale
sour
taste
to
it
the
tap
version
was
fresher
refreshing
highly
carbonated
but
good
decent
yeast
flavors
some
hops
to
finish
its

that
the

ive
had
plenty
of
hefeweizens
in
my
day
but
this
is
my
first
kristalweizen
while
this
is
a
great
brew
i
still
prefer
the
unfiltered
dirty
hefes
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
and
really
enjoyable
it
has
a
way
of
going
down
before
you
really
notice
it
is
done
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
aftertaste
then
lets
go
like
it
wasnt
even
there
it
is
really
refreshing
and
was
my
favorite
beer
of
the
night
carbonation
is
nice
and
high
body
seems
a
little
watery
drinkability
excellent
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
found
it
went
really
well
with
spicy
food
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
wheat
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
good
fresh
beer
that
would
couple
well
with
shell
fish
drinkability
good
beer
all
around
made
professionally
and
you
can
taste
it
not
the
sweetest
example
of
a
krystal
but
good
none
the
less
absolutely
cristaline
clean
yellow
colour
as
usual
an
enormous
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
its
just
like
the
nonfiltered
franziskaner
hefe
but
lighter
aroma
of
bananas
pears
melon
and
cloves
taste
of
the
same
fruits
maybe
some
spice
good
but
if
youve
tried
the
hefe
weissbier
first
its
not
the
same
d
good
drinkability
a
session
beer
to
say
the
least
yummy
d
not
the
most
interesting
beer
going
around
but
certainly
a
nice
well
balanced
wheat
beer
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
weizen
kristal
d
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
its
light
refreshing
and
rather
tasty
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
yet
flavorful
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
then
this
might
fit
the
bill
overall
this
one
was
my
first
kristall
weizen
and
it
proved
to
be
very
refreshing
satiating
and
well
balanced
the
only
downside
was
the
not
so
persistent
head
i
may
have
another
one
but
i
sincerely
prefer
the
nonfiltered
franziskaner
having
this
beer
again
drinkability
very
refreshing
when
chilled
unlike
others
i
feel
this
benefits
with
a
lemon
wedge
slapped
in
there
for
a
citric
summer
edge
had
this
tonight
to
finish
off
my
beer
stash
so
i
can
go
on
a
2
month
abstinence
roll
on
summer
for
me
other
comments
i
definitely
prefer
my
weissbiers
unfiltered
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
franziskaner
is
certainly
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
this
style
this
is
my
first
kristalweizen
but
the
style
notes
say
it
should
be
softer
on
the
palate
than
hefe
that
is
not
how
i
would
describe
this
at
all
you
will
note
that
i
scored
this
beer
highest
on
appearance
my
guess
is
that
is
what
it
was
bred
for
in
an
effort
to
compete
with
pilsner
back
in
the
day
while
this
is
notably
divergent
from
hefe
in
taste
i
cant
say
i
reccomend
bothering
with
it
unless
you
are
a
real
freak
for
wheat
beers
of
all
stripes
this
beer
is
definetly
a
session
beer
nice
product
from
the
franziskaner
family
kristallklar
pours
nicely
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
actually
stays
there
until
half
of
the
glass
smells
a
bit
sweet
but
definetly
hefe
is
like
the
lager
of
his
type
its
color
is
golden
as
the
name
says
is
cristal
seetroughglass
yellow
color
carbonation
is
something
i
miss
in
most
beer
but
not
on
this
one
lots
of
bubbles
mouthfeel
a
little
metallic
for
my
liking
but
still
very
refreshing
on
this
hot
day
the
flavors
quickly
pass
over
the
flavors
sensors
but
not
too
quickly
pours
a
bright
gold
with
a
large
fizzy
head
that
dies
too
quickly
a
good
many
fat
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
the
nose
is
full
of
apples
and
nuts
with
a
phenolic
edge
very
crisp
flavor
is
very
bready
with
wheat
crackers
and
apple
juice
i
like
how
with
each
sip
i
get
that
tart
feeling
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
near
the
molars
like
drikning
cranberry
juice
in
the
sense
of
the
tartness
only
this
is
all
brought
down
in
the
aftertaste
of
bandaids
the
bandaids
are
killing
this
for
me
crisply
carbonated
with
a
moderately
light
weight
on
the
tongue
this
is
decent
enough
but
the
weird
aftertaste
ruins
the
drinkability
on
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
fairly
deep
gold
under
a
two
finger
white
head
that
recedes
every
so
slowly
with
lots
of
body
leaving
lovely
sheets
of
lace
the
nose
is
full
of
spice
and
citrus
with
clove
and
lemon
the
predominant
strains
the
mouth
is
well
carbonated
and
fairly
heavy
almost
sticking
to
the
tongue
the
taste
is
tart
with
the
lemon
dominating
lots
of
clove
too
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
coriander
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
emerges
very
late
but
the
overwhelming
impression
is
slightly
sour
and
very
spicey
with
a
definite
touch
of
wheat
nice
summer
quaffer
this
is
a
nice
methodical
organized
taste
the
wheat
is
subtle
but
still
intregal
and
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
overcarbonated
but
otherwise
spot
on
this
is
a
good
hefe
if
not
such
an
especially
strong
one
i
find
myself
missing
the
sediment
but
only
from
a
visual
perspective
as
the
taste
and
smell
are
textbook
not
one
of
my
very
favorite
hefes
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
on
a
hot
day
excellent
drinkability
here
much
closer
to
a
lager
than
a
weizen
in
experience
this
is
a
very
good
choice
for
when
some
summer
bays
you
are
just
tired
of
hefeweizen
and
need
a
change
d
this
is
the
3rd
kristalklar
ive
had
in
my
life
and
it
certainly
helps
me
make
up
my
mind
to
stick
to
hefeweizen
from
this
point
on
as
the
latter
provides
much
better
value
and
enjoyment
for
money
anyway
drinkability
better
than
average
but
a
little
dissapointing
i
love
me
some
franz
this
one
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
awesome
aroma
lots
of
banana
cloves
and
grains
just
what
i
like
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
the
standard
franz
but
the
fruits
come
through
a
little
better
and
this
one
seems
to
be
a
little
more
creamy
very
tasty
excellent
hefe
found
this
in
chicagoarea
last
weekend
it
pours
a
clean
straw
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
sticks
around
nicely
the
nose
is
nice
and
aromatic
with
banana
sweetness
and
clove
slight
creamyness
as
wel
the
flavor
is
more
mellow
than
the
regular
banana
is
more
weak
clove
is
a
little
more
forward
the
flavor
is
clean
very
refreshing
the
feel
is
creamy
moderate
where
i
expect
it
to
be
i
am
a
big
hefe
fan
so
the
kristal
is
another
that
i
tend
to
enjoy
i
think
i
could
drink
more
of
these
than
the
standard
franz
i
like
the
way
this
beer
is
built
this
beer
is
clean
and
crisp
nice
wheat
and
citrus
flavors
but
just
a
little
too
carbonated
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
franziskaner
hefe
but
the
extra
carbonation
changes
the
beer
signifigantly
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
just
not
something
i
would
drink
often
i
prefer
the
unfilterd
version
i
havent
seen
this
one
around
much
lately
so
when
i
spied
some
at
specs
i
naturally
picked
some
up
clubweisses
color
is
golden
yellow
carbonation
is
moderate
and
the
head
is
huge
and
sticky
the
aroma
is
of
an
average
strength
mix
of
cloves
and
bananas
not
much
different
in
aroma
than
the
fraziskaner
hefe
the
taste
has
an
initial
strong
bite
of
bananaclove
which
then
settles
out
to
a
more
average
level
overall
taste
is
enjoyably
fruity
and
spicy
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
standout
feature
of
this
beer
clubweisse
is
very
active
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
a
lighter
flavored
version
of
their
hefe
but
i
was
pleasently
surprised
with
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
so
crisp
and
delicious
a
fluffy
head
with
healthy
carbonation
that
rose
up
in
lines
from
the
bottom
in
my
tall
weisse
glass
really
nice
citrusy
and
tart
flavors
has
a
light
grainy
malty
taste
and
sourdough
aftertaste
it
does
have
a
surprisingly
substantial
mouth
feel
for
a
filtered
hefe
this
club
weisse
will
see
itself
on
my
summer
beer
roster
and
i
agree
with
venom
dont
ask
for
a
lemon
on
my
watch
its
best
when
drank
alone
interesting
pours
a
very
light
yellow
into
my
tulip
glass
all
that
was
clean
at
the
time
with
a
huge
white
head
that
doesnt
ever
fully
settle
smells
were
definitely
of
wheat
and
french
bread
with
a
wee
hint
of
green
bananna
taste
is
of
wheat
very
light
freshly
baked
sourdough
a
hint
of
apple
a
bit
more
complexity
develops
as
it
warms
but
theres
not
too
much
to
describe
here
this
beer
is
lighter
than
a
hefeweizen
and
looks
like
an
american
macrobrew
except
for
the
huge
head
a
bit
too
light
in
taste
and
texture
for
me
but
the
mouthfeel
did
boast
a
bit
of
pepperyness
due
mostly
to
the
carbonation
very
drinkable
as
it
is
so
light
you
could
easily
knock
2
750ml
bottles
out
not
my
favorite
but
i
suppose
that
it
is
good
for
the
style

with

head
that
is

endlessly

solid
wheat
flavor
slightly

the
high
carbonation
makes
it
taste
spicy
fuller
mouthfeel
than
i
expected

probably
because
the
color
is
similar
to
many
cheap
american
lagers
this
is
my
first
kristallweizen
and
im
now
curious
to
try
other
versions
bland
compared
to
the
hefe
but
a
good
light
summer
beer
poured
a
hearty
head
into
a
weizen
glass
head
remained
until
the
end
smell
of
bananas
and
esters
but
with
a
crisper
less
creamy
taste
and
mouthfeel
much
more
taste
then
i
had
expected
from
a
kristal
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
but
of
course
its
not
as
good
as
the
hefe
still
a
nice
refreshment

a
classic
brew
with
a
unique
character
that
i
could
certainly
identify
in
any
blind
taste
test
have
not
tried
but
always
keen
a
pioneer
of
wheat
beer
in
australia
o
interesting
but
not
great
but
to
be
honest
i
would
not
be
able
to
classify
the
colour
tho
i
was
not
a
connoisseur
at
the
time
o
nice
beer
doesnt
have
a
heavy
feel
goes
well
with
meals
or
the
aussie
weather
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
thing
if
you
like
your
beer
on
the
lighter
side
you
might
enjoy
this
one
overall
this
is
pretty
decent
to
be
fair
its
very
light
on
but
the
style
in
general
is
pretty
light
on
as
well
and
this
does
a
decent
job
of
capturing
the
same
aromatics
and
flavours
never
mind
the
industry
has
moved

you
just

i
can

the

beer
character
trying
to
emerge
very

with

and

notes

just

to

i
guess
it
would
be
categorised
as
good
still
nice
to
down
every
now
and
then
NA
overall
i
actually
prefer
this
version
rather
than
the
kristals
from
germany
though
i
think
that
is
due
to
my
hatred
of
kristals
to
begin
with
at
least
this
one
has
some
taste
to
it
but
i
do
wish
they
would
classify
it
as
a
pilsner
or
something
quite
refreshing
and
not
bad
at
au51
a
case
2013
o
nice
summertime
beer
as
it
is
refrshing
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
nowhere
near
a
kristalweisen
more
a
eurolager
and
really
not
too
different
to
pure
not
good
methinks
cascade
have
dropped
the
standards
over
the
years
second
cascade
tonight
which
has
missed
the
mark
by
a
long
way
not
for
me
very
watery
body
very
clear
light
yellow
blond
heaps
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
soft
drinklike
nose
has
some
character
faintly
spicy
with
some
aromatics
a
bit
of
a
surprise
in
the
mouth
more
herbally
hoppy
notes
and
spice
a
little
reminisce
of
a
german
hefe
but
only
just
essentially
light
bodied
but
some
credit
must
to
the
cascade
for
the
slight
deviation
from
the
norm
i
think
i
was
thrown
by
wheat
beer
being
on
the
label
to
me
it
is
much
more
like
a
lager
i
wish
the
weather
was
warmer
and
then
i
could
down
a
lot
of
these
this
is
arguably
the
best
value
beer
in
the
country
and
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
draught
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
day
and
as
it
is
freely
available
it
should
be
a
more
frequent
choice
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
some
bubbly
head
that
fades
away
fairly
quickly
smells
a
little
yeasty
and
slightly
flowery
tastes
very
clean
some
sweetness
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
very
bubbly
but
not
harsh
finishes
a
little
sour
but
not
bad
all
in
all
its
a
very
nice
blonde
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
especially
for
a
hot
day
it
is
a
very
pale
straw
colour
with
a
moderately
lasting
frothy
head
good
lacing
there
is
little
aroma
although
some
hops
detectable
the
taste
is
of
citrus
hops
with
a
pleasant
but
subdued
bitterness
carbonation
is
well
managed
i
think
of
it
as
being
quite
a
pleasant
lager
a
nice
summer
drink
overall
a
good
refreshing
beer
without
a
lot
to
it
no
faults
and
a
good
balance
i
would
not
classify
it
as
a
kristallweizen
though
perhaps
an
american
wheat
drinkabilityoverall
had
this
on
tap
at
cascade
brewery
and
in
a
bottle
both
were
nice
experiences
definitely
not
a
genuine
wheat
beer
more
like
a
larger
cross
wheat
beer
pretty
average
but
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
NA
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
kristals
ive
ever
hadit
certainly
has
more
weizen
character
than
the
german
varieties
we
get
which
seem
to
be
aimed
at
blandness
this
has
real
yeast
character
i
hope
this
becomes
a
standard
item
since
because
of
my
gout
ive
had
to
cut
back
on
bottleconditioned
unfiltered
beers
and
there
are
almost
no
good
filtered
germanstyle
weizens
out
there
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
sure
its
not
very
exciting
but
its
a
good
drinker
with
a
good
taste
thats
east
to
drink
worth
grabbing
a
pint
if
you
see
it
around
another
really
enjoyable
and
subtle
hit
from
franconia
it
is
great
to
have
another
brewery
that
creates
well
made
and
fresh
german
styles
in
the
heart
of
texas
well
done
and
will
know
doubt
be
underrated
here
a
terrible
looking
beer
that
cleans
up
come
out
a
bit
orange
and
nearly
clear
with
a
head
of
about
a
half
of
finger
not
think
bubbles
nice
and
hoppy
quality
and
grit
wheat
malt
not
as
crisp
as
same
as
it
seems
to
have
an
american
hop
malt
quality
still
something
good
but
not
as
lean
as
i
would
like
to
see
it
i
would
say
more
so
an
american
crystal
wheat
with
come
wheat
quality
but
not
light
in
body
still
happy
to
say
something
like
this
coming
out
of
here
though
thanks
guys
keep
them
coming
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
with
some
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
floral
hops
with
some
wheat
biscuit
malt
and
lemons
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
NA
NA
NA
NA
overall
quite
refreshing
indeed
while
the
graininess
is
just
a
tad
harsh
up
front
the
wheaty
character
really
smooths
out
the
finish
quite
drinkable
but
otherwise
unremarkable
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
light
clear
straw
amber
with
a
fine
half
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
wheat
light
lemon
and
a
hint
of
banana
flavor
is
wheat
mild
biscuit
malt
light
lemon
and
banana
with
a
biscuit
wheat
finish
starts
slightly
sweet
finishes
semidry
light
bodied
but
peppery
carbonation
creates
a
pleasant
mouth
feel
a
nice
weizen
style
beer
thats
great
to
have
fresh
from
a
brewery
i
lean
more
towards
unfiltered
wheat
beers
but
this
has
lots
of
wheat
flavor
and
nicely
subtle
citrus
and
fruit
flavors
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
a
refreshing
light
wheat
beer
i
will
revisit
again
o
light
crisp
and
refreshing
good
summertime
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
good
thirst
quencher
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
the
pilsner
malts
give
it
a
little
body
and
the
finish
is
smooth
great
for
a
hot
day
or
if
you
just
want
something
light
i
easily
drank
a
20oz
glass
before
i
knew
it
NA
NA
NA
overall
in
my
opinion
this
was
a
pretty
good
kristalweizen
that
as
far
as
i
know
was
pretty
good
hell
yeah
i
would
have
this
again
delicious
brew
on
tap
at
swill
craft
beer
dispensary
in
anacortes
overall
they
market
this
as
a
kristalweizen
which
by
its
appearance
it
is
definitely
not
but
im
willing
to
overlook
all
that
because
of
the
awesome
aroma
and
flavor
a
pleasant
enough
and
almost
clear
hefeweizen
the
full
gamut
of
flavours
informs
this
offering
quite
quaffable
on
this
typically
sunny
day
as
we
cusping
leos
start
to
get
er
going
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
im
not
sure
exactly
what
they
were
going
for
here
so
im
not
sure
whether
they
achieved
it
but
sound
seems
to
be
one
of
those
breweries
that
likes
to
experiment
and
i
appreciate
the
spirit
behind
that
even
if
they
cant
all
be
winners
the
body
was
good
clean
dry
and
refreshing
drinkability
will
depend
on
your
tolerance
of
bubblegum
banana
and
clove
overall
a
nice
brew
thats
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
but
its
a
bit
odd
due
to
the
smoky
ham
aroma
and
strong
bubblegum
flavor
o
tasty
drinkable
and
robust
version
of
a
lighter
beer
but
tasty
and
well
done
too
lightbodied
and
low
in
flavor
compared
to
the
unfiltered
version
very
different
style
from
what
i
usually
drink
but
this
was
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
it
was
very
clean
and
looked
like
a
pilsner
the
foamy
head
was
white
and
creamy
the
taste
threw
me
it
has
the
taste
of
a
almost
creamy
wheat
beer
that
you
would
normally
expect
to
be
cloudy
and
unfiltered
this
was
a
great
taste
creamy
and
had
a
lot
of
fruit
notes
very
refreshing
and
i
would
suggest
trying
this
in
the
warmer
months
oh
and
yes
totally
seethrough
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
a
little
expensive
but
great
taste
this
is
a
really
unique
wellmade
beer
a
home
run
as
advertised
crystal
clear
and
golden
yet
packed
with
huge
flavor
it
pours
a
brilliant
white
head
that
stays
around
throughout
the
yeast
is
the
ticket
here
yielding
a
big
bold
aroma
like
a
bouquet
of
sweet
fresh
cut
flowers
slightly
fruity
with
a
bit
of
hop
bite
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
slightly
more
crisp
and
hoppy
yet
as
it
stands
ill
definitely
seek
this
out
again
great
taste
hoppy
filling
beer
beautiful
floral
taste
nice
pale
golden
color
overall
this
obviously
is
still
an
awesome
beer
weihenstephaner
does
no
wrong
however
i
was
rather
disappointed
in
this
beer
my
least
favorite
from
weihenstephaner
but
better
than
most
beers
half
litter
bottle
poured
into
tulip
glassclear
wheat
color
with
good
2
finger
head
with
and
lacing
going
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
delicate
smell
of
yeast
malt
and
light
banana
very
pleasant
taste
of
same
with
smooth
feel
and
perfect
carbonation
with
all
those
tiny
bubbles
smelled
of
soapy
dishes
tastes
of
banana
and
clove
very
crisp
i
love
hefs
and
this
beer
is
everything
im
looking
for
in
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
crisp
and
clean
unlike
many
light
beers
though
there
is
a
defined
fullbodied
wheat
flavor
with
a
touch
of
banana
sweetness
in
the
background
and
no
hops
to
speak
of
an
absolutely
perfect
beer
for
drinking
a
few
pints
outside
in
the
warmth
of
the
spring
or
summertime
it
went
great
with
the
rich
german
food
i
paired
it
with
but
it
could
go
just
as
easily
with
something
as
light
as
a
tuna
sandwich
its
beers
like
this
that
make
me
proud
of
my
bavarian
heritage
well
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
just
for
drinking
on
a
hot
ad
sunny
day
always
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
kristallweiss
never
disappoints
what
i
really
love
about
this
beer
is
the
feel
it
stays
perfectly
carbonated
til
the
last
drop
those
4
tiny
rows
of
tiny
bubbles
constantly
rising
in
the
glass
its
something
to
behold
how
do
the
germans
manage
that
nobody
carbonates
like
the
germans
the
best
of
the
weihenstephaners
o
i
actually
tend
to
like
this
the
filtered
version
better
than
the
traditional
hefeweissbier
from
weihenstephaner
in
part
because
i
prefer
the
less
dense
mouthfeel
and
the
clarity
of
the
colorsappearance
either
way
a
wonderful
refreshing
german
standard
my
first
bottle
tonight
is
a
crisperdryer
version
of
the
normal
weiss
version
remarkable
delicious
tart
pear
or
green
apple
finish
lacks
the
weight
or
depth
of
the
regular
weiss
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
based
on
other
reviews
i
must
have
purchased
a
fresh
bottle
as
this
is
a
no
brainer
overall
as
this
is
a
weihenstephaner
ive
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
wellmade
kristallweissbier
it
is
also
the
first
kristal
i
have
had
to
date
and
judging
by
this
experience
it
will
be
the
last
it
feels
flat
flaccid
and
with
the
usual
wheat
beer
aromas
and
flavours
dulled
down
almost
to
nothingness
the
style
comes
across
as
a
low
carb
beer
is
to
a
lager
pretty
pointless
since
i
can
get
their
hefeweizen
for
actually
less
than
the
equivalent
price
of
au68
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
for
the
kristal
its
a
nobrainer
much
like
the
dunkelweizen
it
has
taken
me
far
too
long
to
try
this
stuff
again
lets
do
it
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
orange
zest
clove
mild
banana
and
a
twinge
of
caramel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
caramel
character
mostly
morphing
into
one
of
cracked
wheat
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
enjoyable
kristalweizen
no
surprise
given
the
caliber
of
the
brewer
good
times
massive
white
foamy
head
were
off
to
a
great
start
crystal
clear
duh
and
golden
with
great
constant
effervescence
the
only
less
that
4
attribute
was
the
smell
only
because
it
seemed
a
little
muted
with
just
a
fraction
of
the
banana
clove
coming
through
and
didnt
really
pick
up
while
drinking
taste
was
thoroughly
superb
theres
the
banana
clove
and
wheaty
backbone
i
was
craving
all
perfectly
balanced
and
way
too
drinkable
these
things
could
disappear
within
seconds
of
pouring
body
matched
the
clean
clear
visual
with
a
light
body
but
still
not
overly
thin
finish
was
perhaps
a
touch
on
the
dry
side
absent
of
any
aftertaste
poured
from
a
half
liter
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
nice
two
inch
fluffy
white
head
straw
yellow
and
crystal
clear
smell
is
wheat
banana
and
cloves
the
taste
is
identical
to
the
aroma
with
the
cloves
and
banana
very
prominent
i
also
get
a
big
bubblegum
tone
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
light
as
a
kristalweizen
should
be
the
prickly
carbonation
adds
just
the
right
touch
overall
this
is
a
very
underappreciated
style
everyone
has
their
hefeweizen
this
one
really
fills
a
niche
great
beer
this
kristalweizen
from
ba
a
filtered
version
of
a
hefeweizen
showcasing
bright
and
clear
bodies
from
pale
straw
to
light
amber
overall
character
will
be
more
clean
and
softer
on
the
palate
and
the
common
banana
and
phenols
will
be
more
subtle
pours
a
clear
light
goldenyellow
in
color
with
a
thick
3finger
foamy
white
head
that
finally
settles
down
to
a
good
3mm
or
so
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
even
ringlike
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
but
doesnt
look
like
one
and
has
some
spice
in
there
also
of
bananas
and
cloves
the
same
with
the
taste
with
some
nice
sweetness
lighter
to
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
tasty
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
never
had
this
style
of
brew
before
but
it
is
good
prosit
i
believe
this
is
my
first
kristalweizen
and
its
pretty
solid
i
think
i
generally
prefer
hefes
though
overall
this
is
a
first
for
us
in
that
weve
never
rated
a
kristallweissbier
the
resounding
feeling
is
that
this
would
be
best
served
at
a
large
festival
in
germany
with
long
wooden
tables
and
beer
maidens
serving
it
up
in
huge
sloshing
mugs
the
glugging
type
of
swill
the
malt
profile
is
unique
in
its
richness
but
it
does
sing
of
your
standard
weissbier
with
all
of
its
soured
metallic
wheatiness
and
watered
afterflow
residual
sugars
are
also
increased
leaving
more
for
the
feel
than
for
the
taste
this
was
a
welcomed
introduction
to
the
style
and
we
shall
look
for
other
beers
of
the
style
that
parallel
this
type
of
authenticity
and
craftsmanship
really
nice
banana
taste
at
start
loses
flavour
towards
end
and
a
bit
flat
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
in
fact
i
might
suspect
whoever
wrote
the
style
description
may
well
have
been
drinking
on
of
these
at
the
time
pours
golden
with
an
inch
of
foamy
white
head
smells
of
bananas
grain
and
cloves
tastes
the
same
going
down
creamy
medium
mouth
just
a
great
bavarian
beer
o
a
very
tasty
wheat
beer
with
good
flavors
and
excellent
balance
try
it
if
wheats
are
your
thing
o
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
the
best
of
the
style
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
so
they
know
what
they
are
doing
pure
enjoyment
o
definitely
an
extremely
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
not
as
wheaty
as
expected
but
otherwise
very
flavorful
a
good
glass
to
drink
with
a
light
meal
a
very
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
one
of
the
best
the
differences
between
weihenstephan
kristallweissbier
and
hefeweissbier
are
fairly
subtle
and
i
say
this
having
had
both
backtoback
either
one
is
a
great
version
of
the
classic
german
wheat
beer
t
follows
the
nose
but
with
more
of
a
bubblegum
aftertaste
to
it
its
a
little
too
bubblegum
pronounced
for
my
liking
but
good
for
style
has
a
good
malt
sweetness
and
although
i
detect
little
breadiness
combines
with
the
bubblegum
flavor
to
make
it
chewy
for
me
bottle
from
gator
beverage
pours
slightly
hazy
but
nearly
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
yeasty
banana
esters
hay
and
wheat
pears
and
light
fruits
flavor
is
banana
yeast
hay
a
honey
sweetness
that
makes
this
sweeter
than
a
hefe
pears
pretty
much
tastes
like
it
smells
very
light
bodied
with
plus
carbonation
with
a
lingering
sweetness
on
the
tongue
a
nice
brew
overall
that
i
would
never
turn
down
reminds
me
of
vitus
but
with
a
dominant
lingering
bitter
flavor
kristall
weissbier
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
very
very
small
lacing
head
with
lots
of
bubbles
there
is
a
earthy
and
meaty
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
strong
but
pale
sweet
malt
backbone
with
some
smoked
meat
flavors
and
some
creamy
wheat
like
notes
good
feel
and
nice
strong
flavors
overall
its
interesting
strong
almost
meat
like
flavor
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
appearance
pours
a
bubblycarbonated
two
finger
head
bright
gold
in
color
and
completely
clear
as
expected
looks
like
a
pilsner
but
has
the
distinct
hefe
taste
with
big
banana
and
spicy
yeast
the
spice
and
fruit
flavor
are
mellow
though
and
blend
into
a
refreshing
smooth
beer
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
smooth
overall
this
is
perfect
beer
for
just
about
any
purpose
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
o
this
is
a
very
lite
easy
to
drink
offering
probably
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
just
isnt
very
bold
overall
i
have
walked
past
this
several
times
and
finally
i
said
ill
give
it
a
try
i
should
of
just
walked
by
to
get
some
original
hefe
or
the
new
yuengling
summer
wheat
which
is
an
amazing
budget
hefe
would
i
buy
this
again
no
its
not
the
hefe
style
that
i
am
growing
to
love
i
would
take
some
summer
wheat
over
this
any
day
overall
an
alright
beer
but
as
stated
not
a
fan
of
the
stronger
wheat
beers
o
as
with
most
of
their
beers
this
one
is
the
standard
when
it
comes
to
the
style
similar
to
the
regular
hefeweizen
but
a
cleaner
palate
perfect
for
a
warm
day
with
all
day
drinkability
s
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
some
chewinessmaybe
creaminess
slightly
coating
4
5
o
wheat
beers
arent
my
bag
but
man
is
this
good
super
drinkable
and
fun
to
look
at
it
puts
on
a
show
it
has
just
enough
tartness
to
take
a
little
off
the
sweet
banana
thing
which
for
me
is
perfect
at
some
point
im
going
to
get
more
serious
about
trying
more
of
the
wheat
beer
family
and
i
have
a
feeling
this
brew
is
going
to
stick
in
my
top
five
right
now
its
no
1
another
tasty
beer
from
weihenstephaner
heave
on
the
banana
and
clove
im
a
bit
more
partial
to
the
darker
beers
with
a
bit
more
nuttiness
and
malt
but
this
is
still
a
superb
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
with
a
massive
head
and
lacing
light
nose
of
yeast
coupled
with
lemon
and
banana
light
medium
body
with
a
smooth
texture
that
is
attacked
by
the
effervescence
of
this
well
carbonated
ale
the
flavor
profile
begins
like
the
nose
then
progresses
to
a
subtle
clove
spiciness
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
nice
clove
twinge
that
lingers
while
outstanding
in
its
own
right
it
tastes
like
a
light
version
of
allagash
white
500ml
weizen
glass
tried
this
a
couple
days
ago
just
such
a
great
flavorful
beer
not
that
bitter
and
i
can
now
remember
the
banana
notes
i
almost
confused
it
with
a
buttery
quality
that
tasted
great
but
makes
more
since
of
banana
over
all
great
beer
and
great
brewer
also
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
seen
in
a
while
o
just
a
perfectly
crafted
beauty
can
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
at
5
4
in
the
summer
time
on
the
porch
but
im
fine
with
drinking
this
in
the
blizzard
right
now
too
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
really
but
this
is
magnificent
o
very
good
refreshing
brew
overall
finally
a
kristallweizen
i
can
get
behind
this
one
maintains
all
of
the
bananaclove
flavors
traditional
to
the
style
and
rather
than
tasting
like
a
diluted
hefeweizen
this
one
drinks
crisp
and
clean
leading
to
a
dry
but
refreshing
finish
a
great
beer

the

a

champagne
indeed
its
refreshing
zest
pairs
well
with
light
cheeses
and
crackers
id
go
their
hefe
every
time
but
a
minor
niggle
in
comparison
i
am
not
an
expert
with
this
style
of
beer
so
i
am
rating
it
per
my
tastes
and
not
so
much
how
it
ranks
against
others
the
beer
poured
a
lighter
golden
fairly
clear
with
thick
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
carries
clove
and
biscuit
the
taste
is
strong
clove
with
some
banana
and
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
decent
but
i
would
not
drink
a
lot
of
it
better
than
95
of
wheat
beers
on
the
planet
only
eclipsed
by
a
few
hefeweizens
overall
a
nice
very
easy
drinking
brew
with
some
great
blend
of
tastes
making
it
a
nice
flavorful
drinker
onice
smooth
beer
that
goes
down
with
little
effort
great
beer
overall
this
was
just
ok
to
me
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
but
thats
about
it
i
cant
see
myself
buying
again
3
25
o
a
fantastic
beer
this
tastes
like
a
5050
mix
of
their
original
premium
and
hefeweissbier
put
together
and
it
executes
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
highly
carbonated
very
refreshing
o
delicious
brew
simple
but
dangerously
drinkable
the
bitterness
and
lack
of
strong
clove
make
it
less
enjoyable
i
prefer
more
blandness
less
carbonation
mouthfeel
and
bitterness
in
this
beer
ocrisp
and
refreshing
easy
drinking
and
great
for
a
hot
day
atmosphere
is
excellent
giant
persistent
head
neverending
effervescence
and
some
nice
lacing
nose
is
hay
with
a
little
citrus
pungent
sourdough
accentuated
with
a
little
honey
and
lemon
citrus
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
overall
my
first
sampling
of
the
style
so
it
seemed
fitting
to
try
one
from
the
king
of
kristalweizens
unshaven
cousin
the
hefeweizen
personally
i
think
i
would
choose
the
latter
for
just
sitting
and
drinking
but
for
fine
dining
the
kristalweizen
is
an
excellent
idea
to
take
the
place
of
wine
due
to
its
refinement
as
well
as
the
fact
that
it
would
work
well
with
a
number
of
different
cuisines

very
very
drinkable
this
is
a

made
for
summer
beer
gardens
soaking
in
the
summer
sun
and
drinking
this
beer
this
beer
is
summer
in
a
glass
delicious
and
highly
recommended
othis
is
a
tasty
beer
and
certainly
an
enjoyable
brew
on
a
summer
day
nothing
is
out
of
the
ordinary
it
looks
like
it
is
supposed
to
it
smells
like
it
is
supposed
to
it
tastes
like
it
supposed
to
and
it
feels
like
it
is
supposed
you
cant
ask
for
more
than
that
and
thatll
do
pig
o
reminds
me
of
their
hefeweizen
which
i
still
prefer
except
with
a
lot
more
sweetness
and
cleaner
overall
what
a
great
beer
to
be
drinking
while
making
banana
bread
this
beer
is
just
as
goods
as
their
hefeweizen
o
world
class
stuff
especially
in
the
summer
3
5
d
if
you
havent
noticed
the
theme
yet
this
is
a
shell
of
its
normal
hefe
self
its
still
a
pretty
damn
good
shell
but
i
dont
see
a
reason
to
ever
buy
this
if
the
hefe
is
available
overall
very
sweet
citrusy
beer
it
reminds
me
of
some
belgian
sweet
champagney
style
beer
i
tried
this
during
a
blind
tasting
and
liked
it
a
lot
overall
you
dont
see
this
style
very
much
in
the
us
but
its
obviously
very
popular
in
certain
parts
of
germany
as
a
hefe
is
already
a
pretty
smooth
beer
by
definition
this
is
basically
an
even
smoother
version
if
you
like
hefes
you
will
like
this
but
this
will
also
appeal
more
towards
lager
drinks
as
well
as
its
clear
without
any
particles
if
thats
not
your
thing
a
truly
amazing
perfectly
balanced
beer
from
one
of
the
worlds
oldest
and
best
breweries
great
beer
super
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
do
agree
with
some
prior
posters
that
this
does
lack
the
body
and
vibrancy
of
many
of
weihenstephaners
other
brews
i
guess
that
is
the
point
of
this
style
though
great
beer
but
ill
choose
most
of
the
others
before
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
drink
the
unfiltered
weissbiers
or
have
a
lager
instead
if
you
must
pours
perfectly
clear
the
color
of
light
straw

a
tinge
of
something
green

a

is
loathe
to
recede

just
stays

just
a

comes
forward
as
it

but
never

and
earthy
delicate
straw

followed
by

combination
of

into
the
middle
tart
flavors
and
a
spicy
tangy
bite
thru
the
middle
to
the
end
with
hints
of
banana
sweetness
finishes
with
a
clean
light
tartness
with
sweet
notes
overtop
fabulous
delicate
textures
and
flavor
nuiances
cant
go
wrong
with
weihenstephaner
tastes
light
and
refreshing
with
a
full
body
lurking
in
the
background
banana
and
clove
notes
are
there
with
some
lemon
zest
bitterness
backed
by
some
earthy
wood
cedar
notes
a
solid
brew
o
again
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
too
much
wineish
taste
and
not
enough
beerness
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
rating
in
my
book
improved
the
2nd
time
i
tried
it
o
great
stuff
their
hefe
is
still
my
favorite
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
and
is
super
delicious
and
refreshing
no
reason
not
to
drink
this
o
very
good
offering
and
better
than
i
expected
this
style
is
so
different
from
the
hefeweizen
but
it
is
very
nicely
done
for
what
it
is
absolutely
a
worldclass
beer
from
a
worldclass
brewer
this
is
a
great
brew
ive
never
had
a
kristalweizen
before
i
dont
believe
but
it
is
quite
refreshing
it
is
crisp
and
smooth
and
has
a
banana
and
citrus
taste
and
smell
this
certainly
has
the
earmarks
of
a
hefe
but
is
more
refreshing
than
most
i
would
get
this
again
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
white
foam
easy
on
the
mouth
a
crisp
and
refreshing
gentle
giant
overall
these
are
the
best
examples
of
the
style
not
as
tasty
as
the
weizenbock
but
i
think
i
prefer
it
to
the
hefeweizen
simply
for
its
easier
drink
ability
a
delightfully
light
beer
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
hell
of
a
deal
at
2
50
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
voluminous
cap
of
white
foam
aroma
smells
prominently
of
banana
and
clove
with
some
yeast
as
well
taste
is
consistent
with
the
aromabanana
clove
and
a
velvety
mouthfeel
courtesy
courtesy
of
the
character
of
the
yeast
and
perky
carbonation
the
appearance
is
obviously
a
stark
contrast
to
that
of
the
unfiltered
hefeweiss
but
the
flavor
holds
up
admirably
in
spite
of
this
its
noticeably
thinner
in
body
and
slightly
less
full
of
flavor
yet
it
captures
that
signature
hefeweiss
essence
a
flavorful
and
refreshing
brew
another
good
beer
by
weihenstephaner
but
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
the
others
ive
had
were
better
just
a
well
crafted
german
beer
no
complaints
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
refreshing
banana
and
malt
notes
great
for
a
seafood
dinner
or
hot
summer
day
overall
it
has
a
very
successful
air
to
it
but
commercial
still
very
nice
after
a
long
day
at
work
everything
from
the
brewery
is
superb
in
quality
and
taste
a
nice
uneven
lace
down
the
sides
and
the
foam
clings
perfectly
the
taste
gets
thin
after
it
drops
toward
the
belly
but
its
a
great
beer
on
all
sides
straight
4
5s
all
the
way
across
for
me
the
mildest
offering
i
have
had
from
this
great
brewery
but
still
so
incredibly
solid
just
try
the
whole
weihenstephaner
catalog
if
you
are
new
to
german
beer
so
nice
overall
theres
no
doubting
this
is
a
wellcrafted
and
wellmade
beer
its
also
a
very
good
kristalweizen
a
style
which
i
feel
is
often
overlooked
of
the
ones
ive
tried
i
think
schneiders
is
better
but
this
makes
a
very
worthy
stablemate
to
weihenstephaners
other

fruity
and
spicy
esters
extremely
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
you
just
dont
see
a
lot
of
these
in
this
country
a
hefe
thats
been
filtered
out
perfectly
clear
hence
kristall
it
really
is
a
lovely
brew
full
flavored
but
delicate
and
light
i
could
drink
this
from
sun
up
til
sun
down
no
worries
the
pours
is
a
bright
and
clear
sunshine
yellow
color
with
a
good
two
inches
of
white
head
the
nose
is
all
the
same
yeasty
banana
and
spice
flavors
im
used
to
in
their
hefeweiss
but
there
a
certain
crispness
to
this
one
the
flavor
is
wheat
malt
on
the
front
end
with
very
little
sweetness
and
a
familiar
and
refreshing
fruity
yeast
finish
weve
been
drinking
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
beers
lately
since
my
old
lady
here
really
likes
that
banana
flavor
this
one
has
a
ton
of
that
and
we
both
really
liked
how
clean
it
drinks
one
bottle
was
definitely
not
enough
but
you
do
have
to
drink
it
when
its
cold
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
it
falls
apart
great
carbonation
and
a
very
light
body
maybe
a
little
thin
but
i
think
thats
the
point
here
taking
out
the
yeast
really
makes
this
an
all
day
drinker
that
doesnt
fill
you
up
a
lick
impressive
stuff
again
from
weihenstephaner
overall
very
light
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
step
down
from
a
hefe
lacks
the
flavors
crispness
and
overall
feel
still
tasty
and
soild
and
for
sure
worth
a
drink
to
summarize
this
is
crisp
refreshing
and
simple
but
still
a
great
product
as
always
from
weihenstephan
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
should
do
good
for
any
occasion
that
i
want
a
worldclass
take
on
a
kristalweizen
when
im
not
feeling
like
packing
myself
with
the
far
breadier
characteristics
of
a
hefe
if
theres
any
beer
ill
drink
representing
this
style
this
is
the
one
prost
overall
this
is
a
very
good
introductory
beer
also
is
a
great
cleanser
between
different
beers
and
i
can
see
it
going
with
loads
of
different
foods
not
over
powering
but
not
bland
either
fits
the
style
perfectly
overall
i
think
itd
be
a
great
summer
beer
and
i
may
try
it
again
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
then
again
if
i
like
the
hefeweissbier
better
and
thats
the
same
price
ill
probably
skip
this
and
go
with
that
as
thats
still
light
as
well
overall
nice
and
refreshing
i
prefer
the
unfiltered
version
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
the
best
weihenstephaner
but
i
have
enjoyed
this
brewerys
portfolio
mouthfeel
is
good
very
drinkable
the
beer
pours
superbly
clear
like
ginger
ale
in
color
with
yellow
straw
tendencies
the
head
is
massively
smooth
and
white
with
tightly
packed
bubbles
the
body
is
extremely
clear
with
lots
of
bubbles
running
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
lacing
is
slippery
sticky
with
fat
and
thick
with
walls
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
like
latte
foam
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
cleanly
of
wet
banana
and
clove
with
nice
light
yeast
notes
and
slight
spices
from
the
wheat
the
beer
tastes
similarly
bananay
with
clove
notes
with
slight
tingly
mint
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
begins
as
clean
light
wheat
malt
before
opening
into
heavy
banana
notes
with
light
clove
hints
and
slowly
closing
out
into
minty
lingering
on
the
mouth
this
beer
is
superbly
clean
with
light
bubbling
prickles
the
beer
turns
slightly
syrupy
as
it
moves
over
the
tongue
with
light
to
medium
body
and
it
leaves
the
tongue
slightly
dry
and
very
clean
overall
this
is
a
superbly
clean
weizen
beer
i
admittedly
have
never
had
a
kristalweizen
before
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
style
descriptions
this
beer
meets
them
beautifully
marrying
clean
mouthfeel
with
the
banana
and
clove
flavors
of
a
hefeweizen
a
great
beer
with
awesome
wheat
character
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
on
its
own
with
lively
conversation
or
with
a
meal
o
decent
but
truly
an
also
ran
compared
with
a
good
hefeweizen
overall
i
enjoyed
this
offering
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
offering
from
weihenstephaner
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
to
say
the
least
this
beer
has
definitely
earned
its
way
into
my
rotation
with
that
said
i
still
prefer
their
not
filtered
weizens
o
refreshing
not
overly
complex
simple
wellbalanced
doesnt
demand
a
lot
out
of
you
but
satisfies
good
stuff
very
good
the
essence
of
a
classic
weissbier
is
captured
perfectly
in
the
flavour
and
aroma
it
looks
great
while
the
smell
and
taste
meet
expectations
only
the
mouthfeel
falls
short
of
the
mark
it
just
doesnt
quite
have
the
body
that
the
unfiltered
version
of
this
beer
possesses
ultimately
its
depth
of
character
that
is
reduced
in
this
kristall
the
hefeweissen
just
has
something
extra
however
it
remains
beautifully
crafted
and
highly
drinkable
well
worth
sampling

i

it
is

a

and
a
healthy
dollop
of
senf
would
go
quite
well
with
this
overall
a
very
nice
lighter
beer
its
an
easy
drinker
and
way
better
than
other
light
beer
ive
ever
had
not
something
i
would
have
another
of
due
to
the
light
nature
of
it
but
the
execution
is
killer
very
nice
hefeweisen
easy
to
drink
sweet
and
overall
tasty
slightly
lacking
in
flavor
compared
to
other
hefes
out
there
including
more
by
weihenstephaner
but
good
nonetheless
o
not
a
style
id
go
after
again
but
this
was
enjoyable
im
still
preferential
to
the
hefe
banana
up
front
along
with
sweet
bready
malts
cloves
comes
thought
the
taste
i
get
some
hint
of
apples
raw
cookie
dough
slight
touch
of
lemony
towards
the
finish
body
is
almost
creamy
very
soft
carbonation
delicious
gushing
carbonation
on
opening
pale
straw
colour
large
finelytextured
white
head
is
retentive
and
leaves
a
patchy
lace
wheat
cracker
aroma
with
hints
of
lemon
and
banana
flavours
of
sweet
white
bread
clove
and
banana
lightbodied
and
heavily
carbonated
carbonation
though
abundant
is
soft
and
very
finely
textured
i
prefer
the
richer
mouthfeel
and
stronger
flavours
in
the
regular
weiss
but
this
still
succeeds
on
its
own
merits
o
a
great
beer
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
like
the
name
says
crystal
clear
a
pale
strawyellow
color
with
a
tornado
of
carbonation
the
carbonation
looks
like
wisps
of
smoke
coming
up
from
the
tapered
bottom
of
the
glass
a
huge
hand
width
of
shaving
cream
white
head
on
top
that
stands
on
the
beer
due
to
the
neverending
carbonation
thats
a
good
lookin
beer
the
aroma
coming
off
of
the
beer
is
very
similar
to
the
hefeweizen
some
wheat
banana
and
bubble
gum
bubble
gumbanana
flavors
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
hefe
with
a
little
bit
more
honey
malt
and
grassy
hop
flavor
feel
is
very
light
and
spicy
from
the
carbonation
there
is
a
big
difference
in
the
feel
the
smoothness
of
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
is
not
there
this
makes
the
beer
kind
of
thin
definitely
a
tasty
wellcrafted
beer
ill
be
having
more
of
this
during
the
many
german
beer
fests
in
the
coming
months
prost
a
good
job
of
filtering
the
beer
to
make
it
look
nice
while
keeping
the
important
flavors
in
the
beer
while
i
would
not
make
it
a
habit
to
drink
this
beer
because
i
prefer
traditional
hefeweizens
this
is
a
nice
beer
in
its
own
right
and
is
a
good
alternative
to
a
hefeweizen
if
someone
prefers
a
crispertasting
and
cleanerlooking
beer
pours
clear
golden
with
a
large
white
head
and
plentiful
rising
tiny
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
slowly
the
beer
smells
banana
and
clove
forward
though
not
as
intensely
as
it
is
for
their
hefeweizen
it
smells
cleaner
and
the
wheat
malt
presence
is
bready
in
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
wheat
and
barley
malts
bring
a
bready
taste
the
clove
provides
spicy
balance
and
the
banana
flavor
is
also
present
both
are
milder
than
in
the
hefeweizen
allowing
the
malt
profile
to
shine
this
is
expected
for
the
style
the
body
is
light
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
excellent
refreshing
beer
im
really
much
more
familiar
with
hefeweizens
than
i
am
with
krystalweizens
but
this
was
a
great
example
whereas
a
hefe
is
somewhat
more
substantial
in
both
flavour
and
body
due
to
the
suspended
yeast
i
found
that
this
one
was
a
lot
lighter
and
went
down
much
smoother
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
is
served
cool
enough
i
still
prefer
the
hefe
that
these
guys
make
500ml

a
crystal

large

and
grassy
notes
with
some
mild
bitterness
palate
is
a
light
to
medium
body
a
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
a
combination
of
wheat
sweet
citrus
and
banana
flavor
a
bit
of
tart
notes
with
some
bitterness
on
the
end
for
balance
overall
a
very
good
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
nicely
done
this
beer
pours
with
a
four
finger
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
pale
yellow
in
colour
and
very
bubbly
smells
of
cloves
bananas
wheat
citrus
and
sugar
tastes
just
as
it
smells
moderate
banana
cloves
citrus
wheat
and
a
touch
of
ginger
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
dry
and
a
bit
champagne
like
a
nice
session

o
another
great

beer
overall
bold

lighter

a
bit
overcarbonated
which
ends
up
stinging
the
tongue
and
covering

taste
a
bit
overall
i
am
new
to
kristalwiezen
beer
style
and
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
brew
had
this
beer
with
lunch
at
a
german
restaurant
the
beer
was
pared
with
a
sausage
sampler
platter
fantastic
pairing
for
a
moment
i
felt
like
i
was
in

an
excellent
a
weihenstephaner
kristallweissbier
combines
the
delicious
complex
flavour
profile
of
their
flagship
hefeweizen
with
the
clean
crisp
drinkability
of
a
german
pale
lager
a
fabulous
combination
if
push
came
to
shove
id
probably
prefer
weihenstephaners
regular
hefe
during
much
of
the
year
but
in
the
heat
of
summer
this
stuffs
fresh
crisp
mouthfeel
must
earn
it
some
strong
consideration
definitely
worth
a
try
if
not
a
musthave
originally
reviewed
09162011
o
the
aroma
flavour
is
more
muted
than
the
hefeweizen
i
love
wheat
beers
but
filtering
it
seems
to
take
away
some
of
its
unique
characteristics
despite
that
this
one
still
has
plenty
of
flavour
and
is
certainly
quite
drinkable
on
a
hot
summers
day
marked
high
because
its
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
but
still
not
a
fan
clear
golden
yellow
in
body
with
gigantic
frothy
white
head
that
stays
aroma
of
vanilla
banana
clove
floral
notes
some
honey
tastes
of
vanilla
floral
notes
slight
honey
and
a
light
bitterness
mild
banana
in
the
aftertaste
big
carbonation
bubbly
mouthfeel
light
bodied
wonderful
really
this
beer
was
good
but
a
far
cry
from
what
i
remembered
judging
by
the
date
code
of
4151
it
was
past
its
prime
the
first
number
4
indicates
day
of
month
in
conjunction
with
the
second
two
numbers
final
thoughts
weihenstephaner
markets
itself
as
the
worlds
oldest
continuously
operating
brewery
which
may
in
fact
be
true
regardless
of
that
though
it
is
easily
one
of
the
best
brewerys
around
this
stuff
is
an
incredible
beer
and
practically
the
perfect
example
of
the
kristalweizen
this
is
another
exceptional
beer
brewed
by
the
undisputed
kings
of
wheat
beer
o
i
am
surprised
by
how
close
the
hefeweissbier
and
the
kristallweizen
are
the
kristallweizen
seems
more
light
and
crisp
than
the
hefe
although
both
are
solid
beers
another
one
well
done
from
weihenstephaner
i
still
prefer
the
classic
hefeweizen
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
summer
brew
ive
never
understood
kristalweizens
but
now
i
can
certainly
understand
the
appeal
will
be
back
for
some
of
these
during
the
hottest
days
of
the
summer
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
30
2012
after
purchasing
from
the
king
and
spadina
lcbo
outlet
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
light
gold
colour
with
a
generous
bubbly
snow
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
mild
wheat
some
hops
and
some
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
sweet
wheat
malt
some
spiciness
and
some
fruit
tones
in
the
mix
overall
similar
to
its
hefewiezen
cousin
but
with
a
few
distinct
differences
gone
are
the
yeasty
bubblegum
flavors
and
it
opens
the
door
for
the
wheat
to
shine
through
more
clearly
the
finish
is
more
crisp
and
clean
that
said
i
prefer
the
former
this
is
a
great
beer
but
id
rather
have
the
hefe
or
the
dunkel
overall
nice
but
to
me
it
is
just
a
muted
version
of
the
hefewiezen
which
is
excellent
really
cant
see
why
i
would
ever
pick
this
one
over
the
standard
perhaps
this
is
just
to
say
that
kristalweizens
are
not
my
bag
o
sometimes
when
i
buy
a
new
beer
i
never
check
the
style
guide
to
read
up
on
it
i
would
have
never
expected
something
as
simple
as
filtration
can
make
such
a
difference
this
brewery
has
been
around
the
longest
for
a
reason
a
gold
standard
for
the
style
o
a
tasty
ale
with
loads
of
flavour
but
not
to
be
interpreted
as
overwhelming
nice
summer
ale
quite
fruity
and
sweet
and
well
worth
grabbing
very
pale
light
blonde
colour
2
fingers
of
dense
rocky
head
quite
a
bit
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
banana
and
spice
a
pretty
generous
helping
of
malt
some
bubblegum
and
yeast
clove
and
quite
fruity
as
a
whole
taste
is
spicy
with
biscuitycracker
like
malt
banana
and
cloves
some
yeastiness
with
more
banana
in
the
aftertaste
medium
carb
lightmed
feel
decent
enough
but
room
for
improvement
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
how
flavourful
this
was
as
my
expectations
were
not
super
high
for
some
reason
would
gladly
have
this
again
o
another
weihenstephaner
winner
kristallweissbier
removes
the
unsightliness
of
the
yeast
sediment
and
wheat
proteins
but
keeps
the
core
essence
of
the
beer
intact
plenty
of
yeast
characteristics
have
been
infused
so
deeply
into
the
beer
they
cant
be
taken
away
earthy
spice
and
boatloads
of
bananas
while
the
wheat
still
plays
a
roll
the
pale
malt
is
more
pronounced
in
this
crystal
clear
wheat
fantastic
to
the
last
drop
just
make
sure
it
doesnt
erupt
all
over
your
table
d
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
and
would
certainly
recommend
appropriate
as
a
springtime
indulgence
with
such
a
clean
and
crisp
taste
coupled
with
a
refreshing
spritzerlike
quality
o
weihenstephaner
just
doesnt
disappoint
price
point
quality
and
craftsmanship
just
cant
be
beat
which
is
saying
a
lot
for
an
imported
beer
pricewise
of
course
quality
and
craftsmanship
are
expected
from
a
brewery
this
old
certainly
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
before
overall
i
like
it
better
that
most
hefes
but
i
still
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
overall
ups
and
downs
with
this
one
the
appearance
is
outstanding
and
the
beer
is
clean
and
crisp
it
was
fun
to
try
and
this
would
be
great
on
a
sunny
saturday
afternoon
on
the
deck
with
some
bratwurst
a
hazy
orangey
color
smell
of
bananas
and
cloves
tastes
great
mouthfeel
crisp
and
well
carbonated
more
crisp
than
the
regular
hefeweiss
due
to
filtering
this
is
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
this
is
an
awesome
beer
all
their
beers
are
great
and
have
a
similar
taste
glad
i
tried
it
it
is
a
bit
pricey
though
but
worth
it
o
good
example
of
the
style
well
worth
checking
out
overall
very
light
and
the
flavours
are
fairly
subdued
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
one
but
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
beers
within
this
style
very
clean
flavors
with
excellent
carbonation
the
nose
is
mellow
compared
to
the
flavor
this
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
definitely
a
great
example
of
the
style
will
absolutely
have
this
one
again
and
again
weihenstephnaer
can
craft
a
beer
o
i
still
enjoy
the
hefeweizen
more
but
this
is
no
slouch
really
an
enjoyable
pint
definitely
will
drink
this
again
come
summer
time
o
typical
wiessbier
flavour
but
more
lager
like
a
very
sound
but
unremarkable
beer
o
i
really
like
this
beer
very
delicious
and
a
great
example
of
the
the
style
very
sessionable
i
could
literally
drink
this
beer
all
afternoon
evening
and
not
tire
of
it
what
a
light
beer
should
have
been
in
america
a
slightly
lighter
version
of
something
great
appearance
is
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
big
billow
head
on
top
the
scents
are
of
bread
and
lemon
and
clove
with
a
slight
alcohol
scent
too
but
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
the
taste
is
banana
and
clove
a
touch
of
floralgrassy
flavor
with
a
slight
bubblegum
sweetness
carbonation
is
high
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbeir
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
so
i
cant
help
but
compare
the
two
kristal
falls
a
bit
short
of
its
cloudy
brother
the
smell
and
taste
just
seem
more
muted
maybe
an
older
bottle
but
is
still
very
good
my
first
kristall
weiss
strange
having
that
wheat
beer
taste
in
a
crystal
clear
beer
good
though
very
good
o
this
certainly
tastes
like
it
was
made
a
filtered
hefe
could
not
be
any
better
but
i
will
stick
with
the
original
or
the
dark
version
if
you
prefer
a
very
light
brew
perhaps
progressing
from
the
bud
light
miller
genre
this
is
for
you
an
ok
weissbeir
but
too
much
carbonation
for
my
tastes
hard
to
find
fault
with
this
as
an
example
of
the
style
though
i
still
strongly
prefer
unfiltered
wheat
beers
o
i
would
imagine
that
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
nice
light
and
breadylike
a
much
milder
hefe
weizen
good
beer
overall
o
i
do
like
this
beer
but
i
find
i
rarely
purchase
it
i
prefer
the
hefeweizen
and
this
is
slightly
less
flavorful
still
damn
good
though
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
appropriate
carbonation
light
and
enjoyable
overall
a
nice
one
to
have
one
doesnt
really
go
wrong
grabbing
a
beer
from
weihenstephan
especially
with
their
reasonable
pricing
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
it
goes
down
very
easy
even
more
so
than
a
hefeweizen
a
nice
lighter
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
satisfying
refreshing
and
simple
i
liked
it
overall
impression
while
not
being
able
to
compare
this
beer
or
this
style
of
beer
with
anything
ive
ever
had
before
i
enjoyed
this
tons
it
had
a
great
banana
flavor
with
a
light
and
easy
going
mouthfeel
for
the
entire
time
will
be
looking
out
for
many
other
in
this
style
again
would
suggest
if
your
looking
for
a
refreshing
beer
to
start
your
night
with
not
quite
as
lovely
as
the
unfiltered
version
but
still
a
fantastic
inexpensive
beer
notes
this
is
very
easy
drinking
beer
very
tasty
and
a
good
one
pick
up
cheers
overall
this
brew
is
a
nice
remembrance
of
my
times
in
bavaria
so
this
one
seems
to
have
lost
none
of
its
originality
o
my
first
for
this
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
alot
will
try
to
seek
out
others
to
compare
to
a
very
solid
beer
i
would
love
to
have
around
all
year
o
overall
this
stuff
was
rather
tasty
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
style
its
pretty
good
would
buy
it
again
for
the
price
and
would
love
to
try
this
stuff
legitimately
fresh
from
germany
o
very
drinkable
i
prefer
the
unfiltered
d
very
tasty
brew
easy
drinking
with
plenty
of
fruit
presence
wouldnt
hate
to
come
across
more
of
these
in
the
future
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
it
isnt
my
favorite
weihenstephaner
beer
but
for
the
style
it
was
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
id
certainly
have
agan
though
personally
id
get
their
classic
hefeweizen
over
this
overall
im
glad
i
finally
decided
to
pick
up
this
style
it
is
slightly
different
but
no
worse
than
the
non
filtered
version
i
would
prefer
this
with
a
big
burger
as
it
seems
to
not
fill
you
up
as
much
finishwheat
sour
citrus
notes
excellent
certainly
my
favorite
wheat
beer
out
of
several
tasted
by
far
flavor
is
also
distinct
and
light
but
still
yeasty
and
spicy
coriander
and
clove
are
in
there
with
the
wheat
mildly
sweet
malt
and
mostly
banana
amongst
the
fruits
finish
is
very
clean
carbonation
is
lively
goes
down
easy
an
exceptionally
quenching
brew
but
a
bit
less
interesting
than
the
original
hefe
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
all
that
often
the
standard
is
light
and
refreshing
enough
for
me
with
a
bigger
and
better
taste
and
aroma
500
ml

a

all
attributes
of

are
present
in
this
brew
except
hefe
in
the
bottle
opretty
good
beer
here
there
beers
are
perfect
examples
of
what
the
style
should
be
really
setting
the
benchmark
o
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
at
any
occasion
not
as
full
on
in
flavour
as
the
hefe
but
very
nice
nevertheless
very
similar
to
their
hefeweizen
just
a
bit
more
subdued
in
the
flavors
and
nose
still
quite
enjoyable
overall
o
very
clean
flavors
throughout
i
do
enjoy
this
but
i
think
i
do
care
for
the
original
more
overall
very
good
beer
overall
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
anything
weihenstephaner
offering
this
is
no
exception
this
has
tons
of
subtle
character
and
is
basically
the
definition
of
the
style
i
love
it
and
would
highly
recommend
this
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
beer
its
ok
with
all
the
scores
but
it
did
nothing
for
me
i
think
it
was
the
slightly
watered
down
finish
that
brought
the
overall
score
down
overall
im
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
maybe
its
because
i
havent
had
one
in
a
few
days
and
so
my
perception
is
distorted
maybe
its
because
i
was
just
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
beer
or
maybe
its
simply
because
this
is
a
great
brew
theres
a
certain
the
whole
being
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
quality
to
it
drinks
very
easily
perfect
for
those
occasions
where
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
lighter
crisper
and
yet
still
very
flavorful
this
is
so
drinkable
im
kicking
myself
for
not
buying
more
o
wow
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
these
guys
and
i
wish
it
was
available
all
the
time
but
i
guess
the
fact
it
isnt
just
adds
to
it
overall
i
would
want
to
try
more
beers
in
this
style
but
i
really
was
enjoying
this
one
i
would
drink
it
more
and
i
definitely
will
want
to
compare
this
to
their
hefeweissbier
someday
taste
a
very
good
light
crisp
clean
beer
for
5
i
really
enjoy
all
of
weihenstephaners
offerings
and
cant
beat
the
point
o
ill
need
to
go
back
to
this
one
and
give
it
another
shot
to
be
more
fair
from
what
i
could
tell
its
a
very
good
beer
in
its
style
but
i
think
i
still
prefer
the
tucher
kristall
an
outstanding
example
as
i
would
expect
from
weihenstephaner
not
overpowering
on
the
clove
which
is
usually
what
kills
most
beers
of
similar
styles
for
me
very
agreeable
tasty
yet
light
went
well
with
prosciutto
and
pineapple
pizza
summer
ales
step
aside
kristallweiss
is
here
overall
this
is
the
lighter
alternative
to
the
standard
hefeweizen
and
a
kindred
spirit
to
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
style
light
wheat
elements
and
pleasing
overall
character
makes
for
excellent
drinkability
still
something
inside
me
is
saying
they
filtered
the
good
stuff
out
due
to
the
large
number
of
excellent
hefeweizens
out
there
these

overall
a
fine
beer
and
slight
banana
taste
is
of
wheat
and
clove
in

judging
from
the
smell
it
would
be
equally
at

on

as
it
would

532this
doesnt
exactly
taste
bad
some
other
herbs
this
is
so
very
balanced
some
light
malty
flavors
taste
but
not
creamy
on
the
tongue
while
still
maintaining
many
of
the
qualities
a
wheat
beer
with
yeast
would
have
it
poured
a
medium
wheat
yellow
with
a
lot
of
white
foam
the
smell
of
spices
and
wheat
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
wheat
and
spices
especially
the
taste
of
cloves
was
evident
an
effervescent
and
refreshing
beer
with
little
of
the
bavarian
wheat
fruit
and
spicy
character
great
to
see
weihenstephaner
in
australia
even
though
its
only
the
kristal
having
said
this
this
is
a
nice
kristal
still
has
those
fruity
banana
esters
of
the
regular
heffe
and
still
a
huge
cloveyness
really
smooth
soft
and
manages
to
cover
most
corners
of
the
palate
quite
nicely
tart
flavour
with
some
welcomed
saltyness
nice
one
definitely
one
of
the
better
kristall
weissbiers
ive
had
i
wont
likely
buy
this
again
good
but
i
really
enjoy
the
full
flavours
of
the
hefe
yet
still
an
enjoyable
beer
good
mouthfeel
and
drinks
brilliantly
on
a
hot
day
the
head
was
thin
for
the
style
and
faded
quickly
on
the
so
clear
and
pale
golden
color
body
big
bubbles
very
nice
smell
wheat
yeast
banana
and
a
hint
of
something
roasted
very
sweet
slightly
iodated
too
the
taste
revealed
more
citrus
than
one
could
expect
from
the
smell
very
sweet
almost
artificial
candylike
banana
and
wheat
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
kind
of
light
watery
the
aftertaste
is
of
subtle
fruity
hops
drinkable
but
not
overly
complex
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
some
wheat
and
yeast
lingered
for
a
moment
after
swallowing
very
drinkable
as
this
is
extremely
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
flavor
a
nice
beer
although
i
prefer
a
non
filtered
wheat
its
still
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
perfect
day
for
this
beer
hit
about
80
degrees
today
so
i
decided
to
rotate
the
beer
line
up
quickly
so
i
decided
to
crack
up
this
great
kristall
beer
there
was
no
freshness
date
on
it
so
i
was
a
little
scared
that
it
might
not
be
good
but
when
i
poured
out
this
beer
a
huge
head
developed
so
my
worries
were
put
out
quickly
poured
out
a
nice
light
golden
color
one
of
a
kind
smell
consisted
of
bananas
and
pears
mostly
mixed
in
with
some
other
light
citrus
notes
with
a
touch
of
yeast
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
soft
fruit
hit
the
palate
gently
mixed
with
some
ever
so
slight
hops
towards
the
middle
with
some
wheat
and
malt
going
towards
the
end
and
just
like
their
hefe
this
beer
has
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
in
it
world
class
beer
this
beer
is
truely
a
sight
to
behold
poured
into
my
hackerpschorr
weisse
glass
with
a
2
12
head
billowing
over
the
top
of
gold
liquid
that
is
not
surprisingly
kristall
clear
the
visible
carbonation
is
also
very
beautiful
cloves
bananas
malt
and
a
little
hops
are
all
present
in
the
nose
of
this
beer
taste
is
very
malty
with
spicy
clove
flavors
making
themselves
evident
again
smooth
aftertaste
all
the
flavors
come
together
to
make
this
a
light
flavorful
very
drinkable
beer
crystal
clear
surprising
due
to
the
name
and
powerfully
carbonated
this
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
voluminous
white
head
bannanas
and
clove
are
evident
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
flavor
carbonation
and
spicy
hops
provide
a
prickly
mouthfeel
mothfeel
is
medium
striking
a
good
balance
refreshing
without
feeling
watery
great
beer
seems
to
taste
cleaner
than
a
hefe
without
losing
much
of
the
character
this
brew
is
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
wellcrafted
white
foam
head
on
top
light
malt
scent
citrusy
very
crisp
clean
taste
with
some
elements
of
a
hefe
that
im
more
familiar
with
but
not
all
of
them
a
nice
combo
of
wheat
sweet
malt
some
fruit
tones
not
a
lot
of
hops
that
i
can
find
somewhat
acidic
somewhat
spicy
overall
im
quite
impressed
with
this
one
the
hops
have
a
lemony
sourness
along
with
the
flavor
of
orange
zest
the
taste
of
cloves
is
fairly
potent
a
light
peppery
finish
and
a
taste
of
coriander
provide
an
interesting
aftertaste
it
has
a
dry
refreshing
finish
very
drinkable

nothing

good
body
to
this

the
taste
was
in

with
the
style
and
the
aroma
sweet

flavors
with
very
little
hops
until
well
after
each
mouthful
overall
a
good
example
of
this
style
and
well
worth
drinking
this
nose
is
just
huge
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
big
its
gorgeous
really
and
heavy
on
the
yeast
which
is
how
i
like
it
its
the
same
at
the
taste
this
is
a
solid
4

by

my
favorite
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
in
the
us
nothing
else
that
ive
sample
even
comes
close
what
a
surprise
to
find
this
strange
pint
bottle
at
my
local
beer
store
just
across
the
virginia
state
line
never
heard
of
this
one
but
label
proclaims

bottle
doesnt
look
all
that
dusty
and
its
been
refrigerated
out

an
almost
clear
golden

average

doesnt
hang
around
for
the
ride
citrus
to
the
nose
banana
soda
immediately
comes
to
mind
with
the
1st
sip
very
satisfying
taste
as
the
wheat
grain
grabs
hold
some
sweet
malt
in
the
background
and
some
mild
hoppy
carbonation
come
forth
this
is
very
drinkable
had
no
idea
what
i
had
here
but
ill
be
returning
for
more
of
these
a
very
clean
finish
makes
this
an
excellent
clear
weiss
i
may
rate
this
one
a
few
notches
higher
the
next
time
around
this
pours
a
wonderful
clear
gold
with
a
big
thick
white
afro
of
a
head
aromas
of
bananas
bread
and
light
malt
rise
up
none
of
them
overpowering
the
other
light
malt
and
citrus
flavors
come
in
with
the
slightest
hint
of
banana
more
bready
flavor
than
anything
extremely
clean
and
crisp
oh
so
refreshing
reminds
me
of
a
wheaty
pils
this
isnt
a
complex
brew
but
its
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
as
hell
i
think
as
i
love
the
hefe
from
these
guys
so
much
this

my

you
drinkability
if
the
taste
and

doesnt

this

i

to

it
still

im
not
a

fan
of

although
i
do
like
some
but
i
find
this

quite
palatable
as

rather
than
as

after
the

here

warm
season
beer
beer
pours
with
a
tremendous
head
that
almost
over
flowed
the
glass
with
only
a
slight
pour
i
had
to
pour
this
brew
extremely
slowly
down
the
side
of
the
glass
and
even
then
a
great
white
head
formed
on
top
of
the
brew
the
head
becomes
rocky
and
eventually
dissipates
to
a
perpetual
thin
lace
that
is
maintained
by
carbonation
that
continuously
streams
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
true
to
its
name
this
beer
is
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
straw
color
malty
wheat
aroma
is
quite
noticeable
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
isnt
nearly
as
strong
as
the
appearance
would
first
indicate
restrained
malty
sweetness
arrives
first
with
a
nice
wheat
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
the
malt
sweetness
takes
on
more
subdued
banana
and
clove
characteristics
theres
a
crisp
sharp
tart
taste
towards
mid
swallow
that
passes
nicely
by
very
slight
hops
in
the
end
along
with
the
malts
making
one
last
appearance
the
finish
is
quite
short
with
no
real
aftertaste
this
is
definitely
a
very
drinkable
summertime
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
one
that
you
should
reach
for
a
light
in
body
and
color
clear
wheat
beer
the
taste
was
refreshing
with
its
subtle
banana
esters
and
slightly
in
the
back
malt
taste
very
little
hop
taste
or
aroma
to
speak
of
finishes
with
a
dry
crisp
and
clean
bready
citrusty
taste
all
in
all
a
great
light
summer
beer
and
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
poured
a
light
golden
perhaps
a
little
pale
for
the
style
aroma
is
bright
wheat
malt
and
a
suggestion
of
clove
very
active
tight
carbonation
sharp
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
broad
wheat
malt
a
little
sharp
and
acidic
tempered
somewhat
by
the
yeast
not
strongly
phenolic
but
suggestions
of
clove
and
allspice
pleasant
but
next
time
ill
reach
for
the
hefe
and
the
additional
depth
of
flavor
feel
starts
out
kinda
spirtzy
and
full
textured
with
a
gradual
turn
into
a
light
bready
crisp
and
clean
dry
finish
very
drinkable
and
easy
excellent
summer
wheat
brew
to
quench
down
clear
pale
gold
body
with
good
carbonation
topped
by
a
huge
billowing
rocky
white
head
good
hefty
dose
of
banana
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
bit
overly
bland
a
little
hint
of
the
banana
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
little
or
no
wheat
hops
yeast
cloves
or
anything
else
i
might
have
expected
some
wheat
comes
through
in
the
after
taste
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
not
satisfying
this
beer
had
a
large
offwhite
head
when
it
was
poured
into
my
glass
this
was
just
an
okay
beer
to
me
nothing
all
that
special
in
my
opinion
i
picked
up
an
aroma
that
reminded
me
of
bananas
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
german
wheat
beers
that
i
have
tasted
this
brew
has
a
mild
fruity
banana
aroma
a
very
lively
pour
resulting
in
a
very
large
off
white
head
that
last
lasted
a
fairly
long
time
but
left
little
to
no
lacing
its
body
was
a
very
light
transparent
yellow
orange
color
this
brew
has
a
mild
banana
flavor
to
boot
mild
carbonated
taste
with
little
to
no
after
bite
not
enough
character
in
this
brew
to
make
me
appreciate
it
fully
i
had
this
one
in
a
half
a
liter
glass
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
it
pours
a
pale
clear
golden
color
with
a
3
finger
head
it
looks
like
a
pilsener
there
is
good
head
retention
and
lacing
there
is
a
spicy
clove
aroma
present
with
a
little
fruitiness
the
taste
is
spicy
up
front
with
some
citrus
maltiness
it
seems
to
have
a
lighter
mouthfeel
than
the
hefe
with
more
carbonation
it
has
a
really
great
drinkability
and
is
good
if
you
dont
like
yeast
drinkability
while
this
brew
is
not
on
the
level
of
its
cloudy
and
considerably
more
complex
brothers
its
still
a
fantastic
summer
refresher
good
stuff
from
purportedly
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
in
this
heat
though
itll
so
but
it
will
be
largely
forgotten
especially
as
i
down
it
quickly
in
order
to
get
at
the
weihenstephaner
dunkel
weisse
in
the
fridge
the
pour
from
the
brown
pint
bottle
was
a
very
clear
very
light
straw
and
an
aggressive
pour
provided
a
fluffy
white
head
which
quickly
evaporated
into
a
nice
short
ring
surround
the
glass
the
aroma
had
plenty
of
malt
with
some
cloves
the
taste
featured
the
cloves
with
a
sweet
lingering
on
the
tongue
although
this
kristall
weissbier
had
most
of
the
aspects
of
a
traditional
weissbier
it
is
more
subtle
i
found
no
bubble
gum
nor
banana
in
either
the
aroma
or
the
taste
the
bier
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
dance
upon
my
tongue
i
find
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
all
but
particularly
to
someone
experimenting
with
wheat
beers
very
similar
to
the
hefe
but
not
as
good
in
my
opinion
crystal
clear
gold
with
large
snow
white
head
filtration
seemed
to
take
the
body
and
yeastiness
out
of
it
therefore
lacks
the
flavor
the
hefe
brings
almost
like
a
light
version
of
the
hefe
still
a
quality
brew
just
not
my
idea
of
a
classic
wheat
cheers
to
the
ba
victory
beer
exchange
for
the
sample
mmmm
nice
spicy
smell
with
a
little
citrus
a
little
dust
the
front
is
spicy
leading
to
a
fruity
middle
the
feel
is
tingly
foamy
toward
the
end
a
slight
sour
note
creeps
in
the
finish
is
dry
and
fresh
getting
a
little
buttery
with
temperature
i
think
i
still
like
the
hefe
a
little
more
but
this
is
a
great
beer
fresh
spicy
subtly
fruity
this
beer
poured
dark
clearcrystal
clear
yellow
color
and
formed
a
huge
white
foamy
head
that
latticed
lace
as
it
slowly
and
i
mean
slowly
subsided
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
cloves
and
bananas
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
and
yeastbread
the
finish
was
a
touch
doughy
and
light
not
as
good
as
the
hefe
but
not
a
bad
beer
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
whole
lot
of
yeast
flavor
and
bready
grains
citrus
comes
in
a
bit
to
balance
the
flavor
is
a
bit
toned
down
from
what
i
would
like
i
am
very
surprised
at
the
amount
of
yeast
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
despite
it
not
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
it
is
light
and
refreshing
which
makes
it
a
great
drinker
you
could
surely
sit
back
with
a
few
of
these
it
may
get
a
bit
boring
with
very
little
complexity
but
it
is
still
a
good
brew
pours
a
clear
gold
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
racing
to
the
top
has
a
big
pillowy
white
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lace
behind
aroma
is
exactly
as
i
expect
from
a
weizen
style
sweet
banana
and
clove
esters
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
notes
i
wish
someone
would
come
out
with
weizen
cologne
flavor
is
slighlty
more
subdued
than
the
aroma
some
notes
of
clove
with
just
a
touch
of
banana
as
the
beer
warms
you
lose
more
of
the
esters
and
get
a
more
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
this
beer
is
very
clean
and
smooth
with
a
light
body
another
top
notch
beer
from
brauerei
weihenstephan
an
excellent
wheat
clear
and
light
in
color
with
a
citrusy
clove
smell
refreshing
and
quenching
and
a
head
that
wont
quit
like
most
wheats
that
are
made
well
the
clove
taste
is
apparant
early
in
the
beer
and
since
it
is
a
krystal
there
is
no
yeast
at
the
bottom
which
makes
it
clear
and
not
cloudy
a
good
krystal
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
pillowy

that
slowly
dissipates
in
chucks

is
sweet
and
fruity
with
notes
of
ripe
banana
vanilla
and
clove
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
active
carbonation
taste
follows
the
template
laid
out
in
the
aroma
with
flavors
of
creamy
banana
spicy
clove
and
a
bit
of
nutty
yeast
very
refreshing
and
the
best
of
this
style
ive
ever
had
perfect
for
a
warm
spring
day
like
today
delicious
best
of
class
a
great
brewery
making
a
great

with
a
little

in
the

down
incredibly
easy
there
is
something
about
the
house
yeast
that
imparts
a
tropical
flair
to
their
beers
a
great
summertime
beer
but
just
happened
to
drink
one
here
in
wintergood
year
around
ill
redo
this
with
a
fresher
bottle
next
summer
this
was
a
dissappointment
and
i
know
it
could
be
better
overall
a
very
good
selection
for
a
warm
summer
day
probably
my
least
favorite
brew
from
weihenstephan
that
ive
been
able
to
find
here
in
the
states
anyway
but
thats
not
really
a
slight
against
it
as
much
as
it
is
a
compliment
to
the
rest
about
what
you
would
expect
out
of
a
kristall
weizen
very
light
in
color
with
a
nice
clean
wheat
taste
that
is
light
on
the
palate
but
with
a
slight
bite
to
it
keep
in
mind
when
i
use
the
term
light
i
dont
mean
it
in
the
american
light
sense
this
beer
definitely
has
a
very
solid
and
good
taste
to
it
and
would
be
a
perfect
selection
iof
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
anything
too
strong
or
heavy
the
beer
pours
a
cloudless
light
gold
color
the
head
prestigious
in
size
the
color
a
dazzling
white
and
the
lace
diaphanous
sheets
that
cling
steadily
to
the
glass
nose
crisp
and
clean
malt
dominates
with
light
hints
of
citrus
and
maybe
a
touch
of
yeast
malt
sweet
at
the
start
with
a
middling
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
curtly
acidic
the
hops
purposeful
in
the
spiciness
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
the
delicate
balance
of
hops
malt
wheat
and
perfection
maybe
another
word
to
describe
this
beer
this
german
kristall
weiss
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
sizeable
white
head
which
subsides
quickly
clarity
is
excellent
as
this
is
a
crystal
clear
beer
according
to
the
bottle
steady
carbonation
is
present
throughout
the
duration
of
the
brew
nose
is
rather
earthy
with
notes
of
yeast
and
clove
making
their
respective
marks
taste
is
a
touch
bland
but
still
pretty
good
with
spicy
notes
and
mellow
hops
mouthfeel
is
rather
prickly
and
carbonated
this
would
be
a
nearperfect
summer
thirst
quencher
notes
drinkable
without
a
doubt
with
a
palate
cleansing
quality
certainly
good
drinking
and
a
great
lunch
time
brew
goes
excellent
with
a
cobb
salad
like
weizencrack
everytime
i
lay
my
eyes
on
a
weihenstephaner
my
mouth
goes
to
slavering
and
i
imagine
myself
sinking
a
hatchet
into
the
melon
of
the
beer
store
guy
and
running
off
with
the
lot
profoundly
balanced
between
the
sweet
malt
and
phenols
and
small
dose
of
bittering
hops
each
swig
has
your
buds
wailing
for
more
peppery
nose
with
the
slightest
hints
of
strawberry
and
banana
as
tasty
a
kristall
as
has
ever
been
produced
when
the
pope
is
not
kicking
out
stainedglass
windows
its
likely
hes
kicking
back
with
some
serious
german
wheat
beers
get
some
golden
in
hue
w
brilliant
lager
like
clarity
from
the
filtration
beautiful
persistent
thick
head
akin
to
egg
whites
whipped
to
a
soft
peak
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
soft
banana
esters
smooth
wheat
tartness
and
hints
of
bready
pilsner
malt
clove
phenol
is
present
at
a
trace
flavorwise
a
combination
of
light
wheat
derived
tartness
and
graininess
is
discernible
initially
then
is
ensued
by
muted
signature
weizen
esters
malt
sweetness
is
low
and
is
correspondingly
balanced
by
an
equally
low
hop
bitterness
leaving
this
brew
somewhat
dry
overall
although
the
filtration
and
lack
of
protein
conducive
to
viscosity
has
lightened
the
body
and
mouthfeel
versus
a
hefeweizen
this
brew
retains
a
quenching
refreshing
nature
finishes
dry
w
a
hint
of
clove
ending
abruptly
although
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
prefer
my
weizens
unadulterated
the
filtration
diminishes
the
ester
profile
and
body
yet
maintains
and
perhaps
adds
to
drinkability
this
brew
really
is
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
color
big
rocky
white
head
with
nice
retention
tops
the
brew
really
nice
nose
some
wezen
characteristics
like
banana
and
vanilla
but
also
a
nice
scent
of
belgianlike
yeast
very
solid
vanilla
and
banana
tastes
on
the
palate
spicy
peppery
notes
also
dance
around
this
is
a
little
more
subdued
in
the
tastes
than
a
great
german
hefeweizen
but
this
is
really
nice
i
like
this
a
lot
i
havent
had
many
kristall
weiss
beers
i
must
say
that
i
will
be
trying
more
in
the
future
to
see
how
they
compare
to
this
one
16
oz
bottle
the
guy
at
my
local
beer
store
loves
this
one
and
always
has
it
in
stock
pours
kristall
clear
as
advertised
with
the
same
big
fizzy
head
as
the
other
kristalls
nice
wheat
yeasty
smell
some
citrus
then
a
certain
sourness
took
over
some
very
noticable
yeast
flavors
but
again
a
very
bitter
sour
finish
that
wasnt
expected
not
as
crisp
and
clean
as
the
other
kristalls
i
have
had
and
a
bit
heavier
for
some
reason
the
sourness
maybe
stale
flavors
dominated
i
would
choose
the
franziskaner
clubweiss
over
this
one
what
a
clear
beer
i
figured
that
it
would
be
not
not
this
clear
and
for
a
wiezen
i
dont
know
how
they
were
able
to
come
up
with
such
wonderful
yeast
flavors
without
seeing
the
yeast
slight
banna
clove
taste
but
more
subtle
than
other
weizens
although
i
liked
this
beer
and
found
it
of
amazing
high
quality
i
think
i
prefer
the
richer
weissbiers
that
have
more
of
a
body
this
is
a
light
beer
but
packed
with
lovely
flavor
a
one
pint
bottle
poured
into
a
weihenstephaner
glass
with
lemon
on
the
rimthe
head
pours
a
initially
huge
frothy
white
that
is
l
fairly
long
lasting
the
body
is
sparkling
clear
filtered
wheat
golden
aroma
is
moderately
yeasty
dough
moderately
malty
light
bread
with
a
note
of
clove
and
a
hint
of
banana
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
moderately
acidic
lightly
bitter
finish
is
moderately
acidic
lightly
bitter
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
excellent
brew
it
has
a
snappier
finish
than
the
hefe
the
carbotations
seemed
to
bother
me
a
bit
it
gave
it
too
much
a
a
foamy
texture
maybe
mine
was
a
little
too
warm
good
for
the
style
not
my
type
of
beer
though
you
god
damn
right
rivals
live
oak
for
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
in
the
state
though
still
a
very
distinct
style
that
is
done
perfectly
i
would
love
to
try
this
next
to
weihenstephaner
when
i
get
a
chance
a
lovely
beer
that
i
cant
recommend
enough
NA
NA
the
taste
was
a
letdown
food
match
kristals
tend
to
be
a
lighter

weizen
with
this
one
there
is
a
lager
grass
note
thrown
into
the
mix
so
the
food
match
has
a
bit
more
scope
i
would
see
this
working
well

anything

this

biers
overall
i
think
a
bottle
or
two
would
go
down
quite
well
on
a
very
hot
day
but
it
is
still
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
standout
id
say
about
average
in
the
style
if
i
had
to
guess
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
dr
it
does
hide
its
abv
well
and
you
could
down
a
pint
easily
as
its
not
overcarbonated
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
unless
your
only
alternatives
were
american
macro
shitebeer
can
we
go
ahead
and
make
this
a
style
on
beeradvocate
looked
and
smelled
good
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
and
body
departments
poured
with
a
nice
large
white
thick
foamy
frothy
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
yellow
aroma
is
standard
bavarian
weiss
malt
bananas
spices
bit
of
lemon
flavor
is
where
it
gets
a
little
shallow
and
has
a
bit
of
a
metallic
component
body
is
good
and
carbonatioin
is
ok
finish
is
like
favor
nothing
too
special
here
its
a
light
and
drinkable
beer
forgive
it
its
sweetness
and
its
mellow
very
smooth
and
easy
to
imbibe
limited
time
offer
at
the
px
in
korea
i
dont
recall
ever
getting
that
much
head
out
of
a
bottle
of
beer
slightly
fruity
and
sweet
very
drinkable
kristal
drank
out
of
a
pint
weizen
glass
and
although
i
poured
carefully
started
off
with
about
4
of
light
foam
it
dissipated
quickly
and
did
not
attach
to
glassware
would
recommend
i
remember
really
enjoying
this
in
the
past
but
i
think
its
because
it
gives
vaguely
pleasant
wheat
flavours
without
the
spicy
and
tart
potency
of
the
hefeweizen
its
a
weaker
more
accessible
beer
maybe
drinkable
but
not
impressive
overall
it
is
good
but
somewhat
seemed
too
mild
and
lacking
flavour
in
the
beginning
but
i
started
to
enjoy
it
much
more
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
i
didnt
buy
this
beer
in
the
good
ol
u
s
of
a
instead
a
good
fried
of
mine
picked
this
up
for
me
while
they
were
in
germany
am
i
glad
he
did
yeah
i
really
am
this
was
an
easy
drinking
crispy
session
weizen
drinkability
very
pleasant
to
drink
but
lacking
in
complexity
and
any
depth
if
this
were
an
australian
wheat
beer
i
would
be
saying
that
it
isnt
a
bad
effort
fact
is
this
is
a
german
wheat
beer
and
while
kristalweizens
tend
to
have
less
flavour
than
hefes
there
is
no
real
excuse
for
this
beer
being
bland
no
real
flaws
it
just
doesnt
excel
or
excite
in
any
way
it
has
a
straw
yellow
colored
body
with
lots
of
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweeter
than
the
hefe
and
not
as
spicy
the
taste
is
not
as
banana
and
or
orange
like
but
is
equally
as
fruity
with
different
fruit
esters
that
were
hard
for
me
to
put
my
finger
on
maybe
more
lemon
than
orange
in
flavor
there
is
still
a
little
bit
of
clove
tones
it
is
on
the
heavy
end
of
being
light
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
it
a
refreshing
beer
for
a
day
of
bahnhof
hopping
sometimes
heffeweizens
can
become
too
much
banana
flavor
for
me
so
this
is
a
nice
lighter
alternative
a
great
fullflavored
light
beer
pours
a
blonde
colour
with
light
head
which
laces
the
glass
smells
very
fruity
wheaty
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
banana
very
crisp
clean
taste
with
a
mild
bananayeast
flavour
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
makes
the
tongue
come
alive
very
drinkable
nice
drop
drinkability
is
decently
refreshing
but
lacking
character
this
brew
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
and
the
lemon
it
was
served
with
did
not
help
the
situation
at
all
i
like
it
and
highly
recommend
it
cant
beat
this
for
the
price
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
foamy
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
smells
of
wheat
malt
and
sweet
yeast
with
a
faint
hint
of
banana
tastes
clean
and
sweet
with
some
banana
and
yeast
flavors
there
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
with
lots
of
tingling
on
the
tongue
just
like
a
weizen
should
be
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
nice
kristallweizen
drinkable
enough
but
for
the
same
price
the
regular
hefe
has
a
lot
more
character
i
guess
thats
not
really
all
that
suprising
though
having
this
beer
again
im
tasting
this
in
parallel
with
weihenstephan
and
erdinger
hefe
the
toasty
nose
is
the
real
difference
here
not
sure
how
that
aligns
with
style
its
still
a
nice
drop
i
had
this
in
winter
and
look
forward
to
trying
it
on
a
hot
summers
evening
when
it
is
likely
to
excell
this
beer
is
made
in
the
state
of
hesse
and
it
makes
a
great
wheat
beer
it
is
the
national
group
of
binding
in
frankfurt
the
orignial
brewery
site
was
the
home
of
peter
schoffer
a
pioneering
printer
from
the
same
deal
as
gutenberg
this
is
very
dry
with
a
plummy
damsonlike
fruitiness
and
a
suggestion
of
grapefruit
zest
in
the
finish
it
is
widely
available
in
germany
and
can
be
drunk
at
any
time
of
the
day
trust
me
it
is
not
quite
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
it
is
on
tap
but
really
very
good
if
you
like
wheat
beers
it
truly
doesnt
get
any
better
or
rarely
better
drinkabilityoverall
a
very
nice
refreshing
brew
again
this
brewery
seems
to
produce
classic
brews
for
their
style
this
brew
and
its
brewerys
weizen
line
is
a
great
starter
for
anyone
curious
to
the
style
drinkability
the
metallic
aftertaste
kills
the
chance
of
me
trying
this
beer
again
unusual
but
not
overpowering
banana
notes
stone
fruit
perhaps
apricot
vanilla
wheat
easy
supping
tastes
a
little
watery
a
little
acidic
and
the
banana
comes
thru
tho
not
again
not
overpowering
much
like
other
mid
quality
kristallwiesens
mouthfeel
is
good
quite
carbonated
nice
on
a
hot
day
and
a
slice
of
lemons
tones
down
the
nanas
and
gives
it
more
bite
overall
this
is
pretty
darn
good
just
lacks
the
punch
of
the
hefe
kristall
golden
colour
with
a
tall
rocky
white
head
pleasantly
subdued
banana
aroma
and
crisp
clean
wheat
flavour
with
some
slight
fruitiness
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
in
one
word
i
would
use
is
boring
it
has
all
the
good
characteristics
of
a
weizen
but
nothing
really
makes
too
much
of
an
impression
a
good
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
beer
probably
a
good
beer
with
your
morning
bratwurst
haha
the
beer
started
a
bit
above
average
with
a
clear
straw
color
and
a
creamy
white
head
the
head
took
off
about
half
way
through
the
glass
and
left
no
trace
of
existence
with
lace
or
even
a
couple
of
bubbles
it
has
kind
of
a
week
fruity
fragrance
that
i
almost
had
to
dig
for
the
taste
consisted
of
a
slight
fruitcitrusbitter
combination
although
it
is
a
rather
crisp
drinkable
beer
my
opinion
is
that
it
is
somewhat
average
and
i
will
stick
with
its
companion
the
schöfferhofer
hefeweizen
pretty
average
i
think
i
usd
to
drink
it
a
lot
but
every
time
i
have
it
i
like
it
less
and
less
very
edgy
watery
character
with
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
wheat
and
banana
character
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
NA
NA
NA
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
d
this
is
certainly
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
i
tried
it
due
to
my
lack
of
experience
with
the
style
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
unfiltered
weizen
from
now
on
this
brew
pours
quite
nicely
with
a
golden
clear
body
and
a
decent
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
the
aromas
are
mostly
dominated
by
fruity
esters
and
lemon
drop
the
taste
is
bready
and
lemony
with
a
smooth
crisp
feel
this
is
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
kristall
pours
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
it
appears
to
be
a
more
solid
brew
than
most
kristal
weizens
the
smell
is
of
citrus
and
like
the
appearance
is
richer
than
can
be
expected
in
this
style
unfortunately
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
appearance
and
aroma
the
taste
is
like
citrusy
carbonated
water
with
foam
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
perhaps
my
expectations
were
set
too
high
after
seeing
and
smelling
this
beer
afterall
kristals
are
not
known
for
big
flavor
but
this
beer
was
still
hard
to
finish
the
ratings
here
are
as
another
example
of
how
silly
this
user
base
is
this
beer
is
absolutely
perfect
in
what
it
is
trying
to
accomplish
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
fruit
and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
yeast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
really
easy
to
drink
NA
NA
NA
NA
a
big
rock
staple
better
than
most
macros
barely
the
hint
of
wheat
sets
in
apart
otherwise
you
might
as
well
be
drinking
molson
or
coors
can
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
billowing
white
bubbles
exactly
as
i
remember
this
beer
from
my
grad
school
days
when
it
was
a
staple
at
the
pub
complete
with
horrid
citrus
wedge
floater
none
of
that
this
time
although
after
concentrating
on
this
beers
flavor
i
can
kinda
understand
where
the
urge
to
apply
further
seasoning
comes
from
aroma
is
sweet
and
buttery
more
so
than
its
counterpart
big
rock
velvet
fog
with
a
saccharine
fruitiness
that
recalls
fermented
apple
juice
faint
lemon
and
lime
rinds
and
white
bread
barley
malt
no
real
wheat
spice
on
the
nose
although
there
is
more
of
this
on
the
palate
with
apple
and
faint
lemon
starting
things
off
and
musty
white
peppercorn
spice
showing
up
late
along
with
a
little
root
cellar
funk
and
metallic
notes
thin
fizzy
yet
with
a
diacetyl
slickness
and
generally
unoffensive
and
easy
drinking
finishes
semidry
i
prefer
velvet
fog
which
has
more
wheat
character
and
a
more
assertive
flavor
period
although
with
this
style
of
beer
we
arent
expecting
anything
too
robust
i
have
a
few
more
cans
squirreled
away
for
a
sunny
day
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
aroma
and
mouthfeel
taste
very
middle
of
the
road
still
a
plenty
light
body
wheat
no
hops
some
lemon
or
orange
rind
maybe
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
beer
one
of
those
summer
or
friend
beers
to
have
around
cant
say
there
is
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
it
just
is
carbonation
seems
high
to
give
it
an
even
lighter
body
i
would
guess
some
fruity
metallic
notes
on
the
undercurrent
if
you
look
for
it
overall
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
in
summer
d
alright
now
that
ive
spent
this
entire
review
sounding
snobby
and
whiny
ill
admit
this
is
a
thoroughly
drinkable
brew
and
is
completely
unoffensive
there
are
no
off
flavors
present
but
theres
so
little
flavor
here
it
would
be
hard
to
get
it
wrong
this
is
just
another
example
of
an
pseudomicro
brewery
product
that
would
lend
itself
a
hand
in
the
rating
department
if
it
was
marketed
under
the
proper
style
that
is
a
lager
its
because
of
beers
like
this
that
people
are
getting
the
wrong
idea
about
craft
beer
oh
and
insert
generic
and
obligatory
its
a
step
above
bud
but
nothing
special
comment
here
thanks
but
ill
pass
next
time
overall
definitely
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
when
your
other
options
are
coors
light
or
molson
canadian
this
is
a
decent
option
o
a
farily
uninspiring
example
of
the
style
only
worth
ordering
if
my
other
options
are
labatt
or
molson
grabbed
a
pint
at
ethels
lounge
poured
a
half
finger
head
into
a
pint
glass
yellow
amber
colour
white
head
with
little
retention
smell
is
wheat
with
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
was
a
bitter
wheat
with
an
off
aftertaste
with
some
nice
grapefruit
and
pepper
notes
medium
body
with
some
carbonation
not
overly
smooth
not
a
bad
brew
but
if
i
had
known
they
had
mad
tom
i
would
not
have
even
considered
it
big
rock
grasshopper
wheat
ale
calgary
i
was
on
vacation
in
the
calgarybanff
area
and
that
afforded
me
the
opportunity
to
try
the
big
rock
brewerys
grasshopper
wheat
ale
it
pours
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
rapidly
and
has
a
very
clear
amber
color
this
is
a
filtered
wheat
not
much
of
an
aroma
to
speak
of
flavor
is
ok
but
thin
with
good
mouthfeel
this
is
an
ok
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
not
an
outstanding
wheat
try
it
if
you
are
in
calgary
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
sample
this
brew
had
a
chance
to
try
a
big
rock
grasshopper
at
a
conference
in
calgary
the
bottle
was
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
and
did
not
generate
much
head
the
color
was
more
yellow
than
golden
and
the
clarity
was
clear
for
a
wheat
beer
which
surprised
me
a
little
there
was
some
cirtus
notes
to
the
nose
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
was
good
well
balance
wheat
beer
nothing
extravagent
the
mouthfeel
made
for
a
perfect
after
lawn
mowing
beer
i
may
be
biased
because
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
in
my
heart
but
i
still
like
grasshopper
along
with
trad
it
is
one
of
the
mainstay
big
rock
brews
that
i
will
always
remember
fondly
as
somewhat
exotic
but
still
familiar
not
outstanding
but
worlds
away
from
the
bland
seedy
underworld
of
macro
lagerdom
d
i
would
probably
buy
something
else
before
this
but
theres
nothing
offensive
with
this
beer
its
a
average
easy
drinker
drinkability
quite
drinkable
if
one
expects
a
relatively
bland
albeit
inoffensive
beer
d
not
much
of
a
wheat
fan
but
it
seems
to
be
a
middle
of
the
line
kind
of
wheat
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
it
d
its
a
bit
bland
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
more
like
a
watered
down
lager
than
a
wheat
beer
half
pint
served
in
a
glass
came
with
a
lemon
wedge
which
i
threw
out
but
not
before
the
meagre
head
was
killed
some
lacing
clear
golden
yellow
hardly
any
smell
a
mildly
flavoured
beer
a
light
hops
finish
a
slightly
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
refreshing
and
well
balanced
a
worthy
go
to
beer
commonly
found
in
western
canada
this
is
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
the
flavor
is
limited
but
its
refreshing
and
would
make
a
good
session
or
summer
beer
woody
is
bang
on
when
he
says
the
head
is
the
colour
of
french
vanilla
the
head
also
shows
poor
retention
the
beer
itself
is
golden
in
colour
and
crystal
clear
it
has
a
mildly
sweet
aroma
with
a
possibly
imagined
hint
of
banana
candy
or
vanilla
it
tastes
slightly
tangy
with
a
very
subtle
banana
note
subtle
just
might
be
an
overstatement
clean
but
bland
and
devoid
of
character
to
the
point
of
being
insipid
it
feels
thin
and
watery
with
a
light
body
and
low
carbonation
really
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
so
is
a
good
pilsener
and
a
good
pilsener
would
pack
a
little
bit
more
flavour
than
this
i
got
a
rocky
two
fingers
worth
of
french
vanillacolored
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
beautiful
goldenyellow
with

with

light
sweetness
lawnmower
beer
d
interesting
but
not
great
while
id
characterize
this
as
a
lackluster
wheat
beer
id
hardly
hesitate
to
choose
between
this
one
and
the
xo
if
forced
to
make
the
choice
this
one
is
not
great
but
at
least
its
not
awful
in
fact
on
a
really
hot
summer
afternoon
this
would
make
a
suitable
light
refreshment
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
score
a
sixpack
of
these
but
between
the
big
rock
traditional
and
the
xo
this
one
lands
smack
in
the
middle
tastewise
despite
its
faults
grasshopper
is
indeed
drinkable
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
patio
on
a
hot
day
nothing
about
the
beer
offends
me
its
not
skunky
or
poorly
crafted
but
then
again
nothing
impresses
me
about
it
either
if
saying
nothing
about
it
offends
me
and
drinkable
are
the
highest
praise
i
can
muster
then
its
probably
worth
moving
on
to
something
else
hard
to
avoid
in
calgary
not
that
you
need
to
avoid
this
beer
its
just
nothing
worth
bragging
about
overall
a
decent
brew
id
much
rather
prefer
a
nice
tasty
hefeweizen
but
this
is
a
great
quaffable
macro
that
deviates
from
that
crowd
enough
to
make
me
willing
to
buy
a
6er
of
this
on
a
hot
day
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
just
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
enjoying
a
step
above
a
drinking
beer
in
comparison
to
a
macro
beer
drinkability
you
can
pound
away
on
a
few
of
these
without
any
problem
a
good
beer
for
the
summertime
evenings
d
highly
drinkable
just
not
very
interesting
this
is
very
close
to
an
adjunct
lager
in
taste
final
thoughts
well
after
trying
this
i
can
see
why
this
style
hasnt
really
taken
off
as
well
as
wits
or
hefs
its
a
bit
tame
by
wheat
beer
standards
and
too
strange
by
guzzler
standards
still
i
enjoyed
the
experience
and
it
would
be
a
good
buy
for
going
camping
which
i
think
is
the
way
this
beer
is
marketed
given
the
name
id
pick
up
a
six
pack
for
the
weekend
just
for
a
change
of
pace
pours
with
an
extremely
small
white
head
with
virtually
no
lacing
and
a
clear
yellow
color
as
for
aroma
doesnt
really
smell
like
much
to
be
honest
let
alone
wheat
body
and
texture
are
light
and
thin
with
average
carbonation
duration
of
the
flavor
is
extremely
short
swallow
it
and
its
gone
i
cant
really
taste
any
wheat
either
tastes
very
light
almost
like
a
light
macro
beer
overall
its
ok
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
but
if
you
want
a
real
wheat
ale
try
something
else
this
is
a
remarkably
boring
wheat
beer
but
acceptable
as
a
canadian
craft
alternative
to
aals
as
a
post
yardwork
beer
overall
not
to
bad
it
was
neat
getting
to
try
a
new
beer
it
wasnt
too
hoppy
and
it
wasnt
too
malty
very
easy
to
drink
a
decent
enough
americanized
wheat
ale
nothing
all
that
complex
and
worthy
enough
of
multiple
indulgences
given
the
right
conditions
when
andor
if
you
find
yourself
adrift
in
wild
rose
country
and
one
other
thing
i
looove
saying
the
name
of
this
beer
with
an
aussie
accent
i
just
do
notes
a
little
bland
for
my
liking
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
complexity
but
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
it
is
crisp
clean
and
has
a
good
flavor
to
it
d
i
first
tried
this
at
a
local
bowling
alley
and
i
have
to
admit
i
really
enjoyed
it
so
i
bought
some
and
continue
to
like
this
its
not
as
pronounced
as
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
but
i
think
this
is
easy
to
drink
has
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
over
an
evening
and
would
especially
be
great
during
a
hot
summer
as
a
staple
i
do
recommend
this
and
i
think
big
rock
does
a
great
job
on
just
about
all
of
their
products
overall
this
was
the
first
big
rock
brew
i
tried
and
was
a
favorite
of
mine
when
i
first
started
to
explore
the
craft
beer
scene
but
nowadays
my
tastes
have
expanded
quite
a
bit
and
this
really
is
nothing
more
than
an
overpriced
beer
12
25
a
6er
and
a
beer
that
is
slightly
better
than
labatts
or
molsons
good
intro
beer
d
not
so
sure
about
this
one
its
basically
a
lager
with
very
subdued
weizen
characteristics
i
guess
thats
the
style
but
still
very
average
easy
to
drink
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
as
the
sun
gets
warmer
the
grasshopper
becomes
more
of
an
option
on
tap
with
a
slice
of
lemon
this
is
a
clean
crisp
am
wheat
with
decent
finish
and
great
drinkability
dont
kid
yourself
this
is
no
sipper
or
complex
ale
however
unlike
the
xo
lager
this
one
imho
nails
the
style
really
dont
enjoy
fizzy
beer
which
this
is
meant
to
be
drank
icecold
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
have
it
otherwise
in
terms
of
a
wheat
beer
this
is
not
very
good
but
it
is
refreshing
in
a
similar
way
macrolagers
are
can
imagine
this
tasting
good
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
light

it
not
much
to

heregot
this
one
in
the
15
can
variety
pklike
the
warthog
and
the
ale
way
better
than
this
one
waitress
told
me
this
one
was
a
hefe
which
was
a
touch
confusing
to
start
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
head
that
dissolves
fairly
fast
strangely
crystal
clear
for
a
wheat
beer
my
first
hint
of
a
problem
i
later
realized
it
was
a
kristal
so
i
gave
it
a
repreive
nose
is
mostly
malt
with
a
touch
of
wheat
and
lemon
pretty
weak
taste
is
stronger
although
still
dominated
by
lemon
and
malt
not
wheat
as
is
generally
the
pattern
body
is
medium
average
with
strong
carbonation
overall
very
mediocre
although
not
particularly
offensive
wouldnt
want
to
have
to
many
poured
clear
light
golden
without
any
obvious
sign
that
its
a
wheat
beer
very
fizzy
with
an
offwhite
head
half
a
finger
the
retention
was
not
bad
at
all
wet
grass
damp
basement
odour
unpleasant
taste
bitter
sour
effect
i
tried
to
put
my
finger
on
the
aftertaste
but
kept
wondering
if
they
use
real
grasshoppers
in
this
beer
truth
be
told
i
was
glad
to
get
this
tasting
over
with
and
chose
not
to
finish
the
bottle
ive
had
other
products
from
this
brewery
that
i
thought
were
perfectly
okay
as
for
this
beer
i
would
not
recommend
it
this
beer
has
an
aroma
that
reminds
more
of
rye
than
wheat
it
has
a
nice
golden
colour
when
poured
it
is
smooth
to
the
tongue
and
is
smooth
tasting
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
somebody
wanting
to
try
a
decent
wheat
beer
without
paying
a
lot
of
money
i
really
want
to
like
this
brewers
product
given
they
were
once
the
lone
beacon
of
microbrewers
here
in
alberta
but
so
far
i
havent
been
impressed
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
bubbly
white
head
that
laces
fairly
well
aroma
of
cereal
bit
of
citrus
some
off
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
taste
was
some
sweet
grain
almost
like
corn
with
bit
of
wheat
tang
and
some
dry
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
clean
with
some
hop
crispness
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
wouldnt
be
terrible
on
a
hot
day
id
rate
this
higher
as
a
macro
lager
cause
it
drinks
ok
but
for
the
style
and
from
the
can
this
was
worse
than
i
would
have
expected
d
drinks
like
a
macro
grasshopper
why
the
umlauts
is
a
average
north
american
pale
wheat
ale
whose
biggest
positive
is
its
mouthfeel
and
its
benign
drinkability
i
could
toss
back
a
few
of
these
if
there
was
nothing
better
on
hand
but
better
beer
shouldnt
be
that
hard
to
come
by
even
in
canada
pours
a
very
bright
gold
with
a
light
head
the
disappates
very
quickly
in
spite
of
my
bad
attitude
it
turns
out
to
have
suprisingly
good
taste
good
solid
hop
character
for
the
style
smooth
but
present
a
more
than
adequate
mouthfeel
and
theres
not
bitter
or
off
aftertaste
to
the
beer
that
often
happens
with
a
light
mass
market
while
light
and
excessively
easy
to
drink
it
is
by
no
means
unenjoyable
if
i
was
in
a
meat
market
beer
bar
id
order
this
over
other
macros
being
in
a
can
gives
a
bad
impression
to
start
but
it
seems
to
have
no
real
affect
ive
rarely
had
a
beer
from
a
can
since
sipping
on
my
dads
miller
light
in
the
70s
so
this
is
a
refreshing
surprise
at
first
glance
this
poured
a
bright
yellow
with
minimal
head
not
terrible
but
not
overly
impressive
either
smell
is
a
bit
nasty
a
bit
like
dirty
feet
this
stuff
however
doesnt
taste
too
bad
clean
refreshing
with
a
wheaty
aftertaste
that
is
actually
quite
pleasant
easy
going
and
quite
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
hot
summer
day
the
mouthfeel
was
also
light
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
just
not
assertive
enought
to
warrant
having
another
this
beer
does
have
drinkability
going
for
it
if
you
were
out
to
pound
down
a
few
on
a
hot
day
you
would
find
grasshopper
an
easy
choice
id
say
it
is
a
wheat
beer
for
the
macro
masses
not
much
to
it
but
different
enough
to
make
the
average
beer
drinker
feel
like
hes
trying
something
wild
appeared
a
bright
gold
golor
with
a
sturdy
white
colored
head
that
didnt
move
a
muscle
aromas
of
grains
dried
fruit
and
lemon
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
taste
was
that
of
a
hefe
with
subtle
banana
flavors
flavorful
with
elements
of
fruits
and
citruslemon
while
still
having
bread
grain
characteristics
underneath
good
texture
with
the
carbonation
refreshing
and
engaging
good
drinkability
had
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
not
terrible
i
could
drink
a
couple
i
guess
but
probably
wouldnt
session
it
or
seek
it
out
i
will
try
some
others
by
big
rock
if
i
can
find
them
in
ontario
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
great
slightly
overcarbonated
and
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
but
drinkability
is
quite
impressive
big
rock
grasshopper
wheat
beer
is
most
definitely
a
brew
that
youd
have
while
enjoying
the
company
of
friends
in
the
dead
of
summer
perhaps
out
by
the
pool
or
on
the
patio
multiple
drinks
are
the
name
of
the
game
and
while
grasshopper
is
far
from
an
ideal
in
terms
of
representing
its
style
its
quite
tasty
and
no
doubt
a
catalyst
in
good
times
if
only
for
that
reason
then
its
worth
a
try
rather
weak
looking
pour
nothing
like
the
beautiful
violent
carbonation
ive
seen
in
this
style
before
head
subsides
quickly
to
nothing
with
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
i
find
that
a
lot
of
big
rocks
beers
tend
to
pour
rather
weakly
and
then
have
good
zip
in
the
mouth
well
see
smell
is
a
bit
sour
obscuring
the
natural
pearbanana
notes
im
hoping
to
find

is
nicer
than
the
smell
though
good
wheatybready

after

weakens
quickly
and
feels
thin

down
real
easy
this
is
a
pretty
clean
and
refreshing
beer
but
not
very
exciting
a
straight
average
offering
from
big
rock
this
or
mcnallys
extra
are
the
best
big
rock
offerings
this
is
an
unchallenging
simple

it
would
be
good
in
the
summer
great

an
ok
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try

would
i
have
it
again
possibly
if
its
the
best
or
the
only
thing
available
i
had
one
and
moved
on
to
something
else
effectively
a
slightly
lemony
flavored
ale
without
much
wheat
beer
character
straw
in

if
your
options
are

but
id
prefer
a
real
wiezen
or
wit
given
the
opportunity
a
nice
refreshing
beer
this
was
first
nonmacro
brew
i
ever
had
introduced
by
a
friend
drinkable
goes
great
with
barbecue
and
warm
weather
this
beer
has
all
the
elements
of
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
big
let
down
decent
aroma
nice
mouthfeel
disappointing
taste
all
in
all
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
im
glad
i
only
have
2
out
of
a
variety
12pack
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
this
anytime
soon
bottle
poured
a
fizzy
golden
color
ale
with
a
small
head
with
no
retention
aroma
is
comprised
of
weak
wheat
taste
is
again
quite
weak
on
wheat
with
a
gross
watery
aftertaste
there
is
also
some
sourness
that
i
could
detect
that
wasnt
pleasant
at
all
bad
bad
stuff
the
beer
is
smoothe
and
goes
down
easy
it
is
very
easy
to
sit
down
and
drink
several
of
these
d
very
light
beer
that
did
show
any
fruitiness
or
any
wheat
flavor
i
felt
this
was
a
kristal
weizen
that
was
trying
to
appeal
to
an
american
adjunct
lager
drinking
market
taste
was
of
shy
caramel
some
shy
bitterness
and
leaving
an
oily
feeling
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
my
german
friends
call
good
north
american
beerit
tastes
like
water
so
it
cant
taste
bad
but
in
all
seriousness
its
refreshing
and
i
kind
of
like
it
despite
all
my
criticism
so
its
not
a
failure
thx
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
and
watery
but
it
hangs
on
to
a
bit
of
body
somehow
i
dont
have
any
urge
to
drink
more
of
this
but
it
was
worth
a
shot
thanks
i
think
to
kmpitz2
for
hooking
me
up
with
the
bottle
why
am
i
reviewing
this
hot
weather
summer
beer
in
december
was
at
a
christmas
party
with
this
coors
light
and
molson
canadian
as
the
choices
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
light
and
malty
with
some
lemon
and
other
light
citrus
fruits
a
bit
of
wheat
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
malty
as
well
pale
and
wheat
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
not
much
else
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
though
doesnt
taste
too
much
like
a
weizen
but
still
ok
tasting
nothing
special
tastewise
nothing
to
distinguish
it
has
a
somewhat
unpleasant
bitter
dry
finish
i
like
the
label
pours
out
a
clear
yellow
color
with
small
head
that
goes
away
quickly
theres
nothing
much
in
the
smell
maybe
some
lemon
i
think
smells
macroish
on
to
the
flavor
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
bud
light
pretty
boring
and
over
produced
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
quickly
the
nose
is
sweet
wheat
with
a
hint
of
citrus
in
it
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
it
it
no
creamy
banana
no
nothing
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
drinkability
is
not
really
good
either
just
an
okay
beer
without
much
either
direction
on
tap
at
the
manx
in
ottawa
on
decent
enough
crystal
clear
light
golden
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
and
than
dies
the
aromas
are
of
wheat
banana
and
an
odd
flavor
that
i
can
not
place
the
taste
is
wheaty
yeasty
and
spicy
this
actually
tastes
more
like
a
medicore
wheat
than
a
weizen
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodiedlight
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
bad
for
a
local
version
sampled
8604
at
the
charlotte
room
toronto
the
server
kept
trying
to
put
fruit
on
my
rim
the
fruit
would
have
totally
blown
the
ales
own
flavor
away
cant
help
but
think
this
is
brewed
with
fast
consumtion
in
mind
341ml
brown
bottle
freshness
date
stamped
on
6pack
box
another
1
75
years
and
i
had
this
in
fresh
bottle
less
metallic
easy
drinking
if
you
crave
german
weizens
give
this
a
pass
and
get
3
liters
of
schneiders
or
ayinger
or
4
erdinger
or
konig
ludwig
instead
of
six
of
these
domestics
if
you
get
stuck
in
vacation
country
with
no
euro
weizens
to
be
found
this
will
do
in
a
pinch
appearance
when
the
bartender
says
that
they
have
a
wheat
beer
flowing
i
got
all
excited
and
ordered
one
right
away
the
beer
came
in
a
mug
with
a
lemon
wedge
already
there
the
filtered
appearance
saddens
me
with
the
golden
orange
tone
of
the
beer
and
fizzy
thin
white
head
leaves
behind
some
specks
of
lace
aroma
a
nice
citrusy
zing
doesnt
have
any
of
the
great
yeast
characteristics
i
have
come
to
enjoy
from
the
german
hefeweizen
but
its
not
bad
sharp
sweetness
decent
taste
the
flavor
is
a
spritzy
mix
of
sweetness
and
citrus
tones
but
a
bit
bland
when
i
added
the
lemon
to
my
beer
which
i
never
do
it
actually
improved
this
one
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
in
body
with
very
fizzy
carbonation
not
bad
but
again
i
was
looking
for
a
fluffy
textured
hefe
drinkability
i
had
a
couple
over
the
course
of
the
weekend
not
my
favorite
but
a
solid
wheat
ale
if
thats
what
your
into
im
not
this
poured
with
very
minimal
head
and
one
which
disappeared
very
quickly
leaving
only
the
least
bit
of
lace
in
appearance
it
resembles
a
classic
pilzen
type
style
it
is
exceptionally
clear
the
colour
is
honey
with
faint
hues
of
yellow
a
grainy
lemony
smell
greets
the
nose
at
first
slight
sourness
some
very
slight
flowery
hop
aromas
exist
appetising
the
taste
is
definitely
wheatfilled
producing
a
strong
grainy
feel
on
the
palate
with
a
pleasant
citrus
note
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
the
hop
presence
is
subtle
yet
wellbalanced
initially
on
the
tongue
one
can
sense
the
slight
sweetness
and
delicate
sourness
so
highly
beloved
in
wheat
beers
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
exceptional
it
can
be
quaffed
easily
and
has
enough
flavour
to
mildly
please
knowledgable
drinkers
no
it
is
not
overly
complex
or
even
exciting
but
it
is
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
it
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
to
start
some
sewagewater
beer
drinker
off
on
the
road
to
better
beer
drinking
notes
grasshopper
is
probably
the
first
beer
i
ever
truly
liked
and
remains
an
affordable
above
average
beer
some
consider
lemons
in
beer
to
be
a
sign
of
terrible
beer
but
i
find
it
does
a
lot
for
this
one
light
gold
color
on
the
pour
modest
bright
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
its
texture
as
it
dissolves
a
thin
sheet
of
lace
makes
attempts
at
sealing
off

is
lightly
sweet
crisp
and
clean
a

of
grapefruit
start
somewhat
sweet

cadaverous

the

light

is

a
very

some

some

not

beat
macro
swill
but
why
bother
mouthfeel
is
thin
finish
is

aftertaste
is
neutral
not
bad
but
really
nothing
to
recommend
it
overall
a
pleasant
enough
beer
that
is
rather
drinkable
and
not
that
bad
at
all
but
as
a
wheat
ale
it
disappoints
me
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
seek
it
out
again
to
be
honest
but
i
would
not
refuse
it
if
i
was
offered
another
one
a
very
average
average
beer
well
the
label
says
wheat
ale
but
still
left
some
lace
in
on
the
glass
smelled
some
barley
and
one
of
my
favorite
regional
ales
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
when
out
and
about
it
pours
out
a
darker
golden
hue
with
interesting
carbonation
its
a
nice
tasty
wheat
beer
garinaug
06
t
medium
light
body
not
so
crisp
on
tongue
the
weizen
and
banana
flavours
are
richer
than
in
the
smelll
wheat
beer
with
a
lot
of
foam
and
good
body
theres
a
lot
of
white

taste
have
a
very
brilliant
yellow
color
i
suppose
that
because
of
it
crystal
is
called
jejeje
pleasant
smell
of
wheat
and
bread
the
flavor
is
good
and
very
carbonated
with
essences
of
wheat
and
olive
oil
with
a
citrus
end
tasty
to
accompany
hamburgers
mouth
gooood
body
dry
and
bittersweet
finish
with

salud
got
it
in
mexico
suprisingly
but
it
was
a
good
news
this
is
the
third
kapuziner
i
have
tried
and
althought
they
are
not
the
best
hefes
they
do
their
job
enough
to
make
me
want
to
drink
weizen
beers
over
lagers
the
colour
is
a
little
lager
but
that
is
why
it
is
a
kristall
weizen
the
aroma
however
is
very
wheaty
and
the
foam
is
intersting
it
has
some
issues
to
be
handled
clear
and
amazing
like
a
pilsner
with
tiny
bubles
on
a
thin
white
head
peppery
wheaty
aroma
doughy
wheaty
pepper
flavor
simple
light
frizzy
body
some
banana
crystal
weizen
are
always
boring
so
no
surprise
that
this
does
not
excite
this
is
a
great
beer
if
on
bargain
sale
but
do
not
search
for
it
poured
a
clear
deep
gold
with
lots
of
bubbles
under
a
thick
contoured
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
but
not
much
lace
the
nose
is
spicey
banana
and
clove
with
lots
of
yeast
the
mouth
is
light
and
prickly
the
flavor
is
a
nice
combination
of
yeast
banana
and
clove
theres
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
which
complements
the
other
flavors
quite
nicely
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
spicey
this
is
a
good
if
unspectacular
version
of
the
style
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
a
bit
harsher
and
less
refined
than
the
2014
version
still
very
tasty
overall
beer
1
in
the
schell
weizen
mixer
the
1984
is
pretty
tasty
but
not
as
intensely
flavorful
as
the
2014
weiss
could
be
because
of
the
filteringstyle
touches
the
usual
hefe
bases
but
not
as
strong
interesting
to
try
poured
this
into
a
august
schell
hexbase
weisse
glass
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
filled
the
top
of
the
glass
appropriately
aroma
of
banana
and
clove
yucky
wheat
malts
in
the
taste
rotten
banana
white
bread
bubblegum
clovy
spice
just
offputting
overall
i
didnt
care
for
it
medium
body
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
grainy
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
ive
definitely
had
better
than
this
unremarkable
besides
the
nostalgia
inducing
smell
certainly
not
as
good
as
the
more
contemporary
recipe
but
still
a
nice
drink
overall
i
drank
it
ok
but
it
wasnt
something
i
was
gulping
down
overall
not
nearly
as
flavorful
as
schells
modern
version
i
dont
know
how
much
is
due
to
recipe
changes
vs
simply
not
filtering
the
beer
any
longer
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
this
for
historical
reasons
but
otherwise
not
worth
having
again
onote
to
self
drink
this
one
close
to
30f
still
flavorful
with
a
better
mouthfeel
like
this
beer
but
prefer
todays
version
still
fun
to
go
back
in
time
when
the
only
beer
i
was
drinking
was
the
warm
backwash
in
dads
returnable
stash
of
hammsthis
is
pretty
good
too
o
liked
trying
the
original
not
as
good
as
todays
version
but
tasty
and
refreshing
a
nice
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
that
is
interesting
enough
to
warrant
continuous
consumption
overall
a
solid
wheat
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
this
one
seems
to
be
a
bit
lighter
and
easier
to
drink
than
the
current
version
but
not
as
dominate
in
the
flavors
heres
the
deal
with
this
one
as
a
kristalweizen
this
beer
is
essentially
an
unfiltered
hefe
while
this
is
a
good
beer
it
offers
very
little
by
way
of
hefeweizen
similarities
points
have
to
be
taken
off
for
style
o
okay
average
nothing
particular
bad
about
it
but
nothing
fantastic
either
would
not
pass
it
up
if
offered
on
a
hot
day
but
would
not
seek
it
out
either
drinkability
is
ok
think
sweet
lager
when
you
drink
this
slight
hefeweizen
flavor
but
it
is
cleaner
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
overall
an
enjoyable
crisp
wheat
beer
however
it
seems
to
blend
into
an
already
flooded
wheat
beer
market
d
doesnt
start
off
strong
but
this
one
kinda
grew
on
me
a
little
bit
still
not
something
i
would
drink
often
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
boring
which
really
doesnt
entice
me
to
return
to
the
glass
however
the
beer
is
easily
sessionable
which
can
be
a
plus
for
me
its
not
a
good
kristal
nor
is
it
a
great
beer
in
general
terms
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
a
head
but
it
took
some
vigorous
pouring
to
get
it
nose
has
a
bit
of
yeasty
and
some
fruity
notes
but
nothing
too
special
taste
is
smooth
not
bitter
not
like
a
weiss
but
more
like
a
pilsner
a
little
bit
of
hops
come
through
the
beer
is
just
thin
watery
bland
and
uninteresting
yup
there
is
some
yeast
some
sweeter
malts
some
honeyed
flavors
this
beer
is
just
so
mediocre
its
not
worth
spending
more
written
words
on
its
okay
there
just
isnt
much
to
this
beer
spanish

brewings
crystal
weiss
american

clear
wheat

is

most

to
have
ever

if
you
like
weakintheknees
oktoberfests
and
hate
hops
then
this
might
be
the
beer
for
you
it
isnt
the
beer
for
me
golden
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
thin
head
aroma
is
a
splash
of
citrus
fruit
taste
is
bready
and
again
a
splash
of
some
citrusy
fruit
pretty
smooth
and
goes
down
like
water
overall
a
pleasant
experiencei
would
recommend
and
would
purchase
again
unfortunately
flavors
follow
light
simple
fruit
simple
yeast
flavors
that
are
insignificant
and
unappealing
this
beer
tastes
like
strong
water
at
best
no
character
whatsoever
cannot
think
why
youd
drink
this
other
than
to
quench
a
genuine
thirst
and
you
didnt
have
water

nice
this
is
a

i

again
NA
NA
this
is
a
proper
beer
not
exactly
mexican
but
a
very
accurate
representation
of
a
great
german
style
i
really
didnt
expect
this
to
be
so
good
and
it
makes
me
wonder
how
many
good
beers
this
brewery
could
produce
if
it
had
the
market
here
in
mexico
this
beer
and
noche
buena
are
my
favorite
beers
in
mexico
and
the
price
converted
to
about
1
a
bottle
in
late
feb
2015
in
xalapa
makes
it
a
goto
when
im
craving
a
wellcrafted
beer
in
a
sea
full
of
tecate
and
corona
this
is
the
only
industrial
weizen
in
mexico
and
thats
good
not
a
very
good
one
compared
to
craft
or
imported
but
its
something
but
i
also
feel
it
is
not
a
real
wheat
beer
like
they
probably
used
10
wheat
grains
and
called
it
a
wheat
beer
but
feels
like
as
if
the
company
has
no
idea
how
to
produce
wheat
beer
at
all
a
passable
beer
a
little
better
than
the
standard
mexican
macros
thanks
to
the
wheat
but
not
much
better
o
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
for
being
a
cuauhtemoc
moctezuma
beer
it
is
actually
not
that
bad
right
now
its
around
90
degress
here
and
after
playing
basketball
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
it
taste
very
refreshing
overall
no
real
yeast
influence
just
a
fruity
and
easy
drinking
warm
weather
brew
m
well
it
is
refreshing
that
is
nice
and
it
could
be
according
to
the
stile
o
this
is
actually
definitely
some
steps
up
from
a
generic
nobeeringredientsmacro
however
i
think
the
execution
is
a
bit
suspect
i
really
dont
understand
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
and
it
really
seems
unnecessarily
soapy
the
mouth
feel
really
isnt
bad
on
this
beer
but
there
seems
to
be
an
odd
relationship
between
the
duration
of
the
flavors
and
the
light
drying
body
of
the
mouth
i
want
to
like
this
beer
as
its
really
not
so
bad
at
all
but
at
the
same
time
it
wins
me
over
in
no
category
it
will
just
have
to
settle
for
simply
better
than
macro

excellent
for
lunch
or
hot
summer
nights
o
the
ultimate
session
beer
in
my
opinion
and
a
great
beer
for
the
warm
summer
weather
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
good
stuff
wish
i
had
some
now
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
the
taste
didnt
seem
right
it
was
too
lemony
and
it
left
my
mouth
dry
just
an
epic
fail
all
around
drinkability
high
drinkability
but
it
lacks
complexity
and
boldness
it
is
still
a
good
brew
dr
average
price
for
a
below
average
beer
o
the
weihenstephan
is
a
better
version
but
makes
an
ok
session
beer
poured
a
medium
yellow
with
a
large
white
frothy
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
strong
of
yeast
light
flowery
hops
and
a
straw
malt
with
notes
of
banana
it
tasted
very
light
with
the
flavor
being
very
yeasty
and
slightly
bitter
in
the
beginning
and
mellowed
to
a
mild
yeast
flavor
with
a
hint
of
banana
and
some
spice
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
an
ok
light
kristall
weisse
drinkability
is
not
good
when
i
can
buy
a
weihenstephaner
for
the
same
price
a
style
seldom
seen
in
the
states
not
too
different
from
regular
hefes
besides
the
appearance
ah
well
there
is
always
a
next
time
that
i
visit
germany
overall
a
good
bier
but
not
a
great
one
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
wonderful
session
bier
i
do
recommend
this
bier
enjoy
prosit
nice
and
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
and
just
good
recommended
d
very
refreshing
to
drink
maybe
slightly
over
carbonated
which
possible
takes
away
from
the
flavours
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
for
a
while
love
it
this
is
the
first
kristalweizen
that
i
have
ever
really
attempted
to
evaluate
so
here
it
goes
it
pours
a
clean
golden
color
that
is
very
similar
to
a
helles
with
a
head
that
is
much
smaller
than
the
normal
weissbier
the
smell
is
rather
neutral
and
seems
kind
of
like
a
light
weissbier
the
taste
i
thought
was
rather
skunked
with
some
very
faint
traces
of
fruitiness
the
overall
mouthfeel
though
is
pretty
smooth
but
this
cant
really
compensate
for
the
taste
easy
beer
to
drink
not
so
simple
to
enjoy
i
could
drink
this
until
the
cows
come
home
especially
for
the
cheap
cheap
price
very
nice
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
in
the
way
others
of
this
style
have
but
its
still
a
solidly
made
brew
taste
is
wheaty
lightly
tangy
and
sweet
with
a
nutty
touch
plus
the
barest
hint
of
ripe
banana
with
a
slightly
powdery
dry
finish
a
light
body
with
lively
carbonation
makes
it
a
very
light
drink
easily
quaffed
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
but
it
isnt
very
interesting
if
i
was
itching
for
a
flavor
like
this
id
probably
reach
for
a
czech
or
german
pils
anyway
very
light
and
clear
straw
color
with
a
white
rocky
creamy
thick
head
aromas
of
baked
apples
with
cinamon
and
brown
sugar
followed
by
bubblegum
flavor
is
a
slightly
subdued
version
of
the
aroma
except
the
addition
of
a
mildly
tart
wheat
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
a
regular
hefeweizen
due
to
the
filtration
yet
this
one
seems
to
have
more
flavor
and
elegance
than
other
kristalweizens
finishes
with
some
firm
pilsener
malt
and
a
touch
of
apples
this
bottle
is
only
the
second
maisels
kristall
ive
had
fifteen
years
after
the
first
one
in
germany
i
just
picked
it
up
tonight
at
a
harris
teeter
because
i
havent
seen
it
in
so
long
and
i
immediately
thought
of
the
fun
night
so
long
ago
when
i
had
my
first
one
fresh
too
drinkability
une
bonne
bière
dans
le
style
kristal
weizen
500
ml
bottle
very
pale
golden
colour
pours
an
enormous
and
vigorous
head
that
will
accompany
you
forever
aroma
of
banana
and
cloves
as
one
can
expect
of
the
style
and
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
with
some
lemon
flavor
clean
and
smooth
beer
refreshing
very
drinkable
but
i
like
more
the
nonfiltered
versions
of
this
kind
body
is
lighter
than
not
filtered
ones
and
it
doesnt
give
you
that
feeling
of
full
stomach
that
non
filtered
gives
ok
now
this
was
a
somewhat
abnormal
pickup
for
me
well
not
really
in
the
sense
of
the
style
just
that
i
normally
would
not
have
picked
this
up
at
this
time
of
year
but
whatever
i
love
them
so
go
for
it
right
poured
a
vigorous
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
head
of
fizzy
white
lace
took
several
pours
before
the
entire
bottle
could
be
released
in
a
very
tall
glass
lots
of
carbonation
was
apparent
from
the
start
through
the
absolutely
flawless
crystal
clear
nature
of
it
no
sediment
and
no
haze
at
all
head
settled
down
to
just
a
thin
film
and
that
lasted
throughout
but
leaving
copious
side
lace
smell
was
very
light
almost
non
existent
at
first
but
then
some
nice
grain
aromas
broke
though
with
a
touch
of
yeast
to
add
light
flavor
as
well
just
a
nice
light
wheat
flavor
is
really
all
that
can
be
said
about
it
mouth
feel
was
again
very
light
with
ample
carbonation
it
went
down
like
water
huge
session
ale
here
this
had
all
the
earmarks
of
a
hot
summer
day
in
the
backyard
brew
overall
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
nowhere
near
the
worst
an
average
hefe
is
better
then
a
macro
any
day
and
this
was
no
exception
a
fine
but
average
selection
drank
a
bunch
of
these
in
half
pint
handles
at
the
germania
club
in
newcastle
poured
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
head
laden
with
phenolics
immediate
and
intense
banana
aroma
that
was
like
a
banana
malt
milkshake
the
taste
had
perfectly
balanced
bananamaltclove
that
was
consistent
to
the
end
i
cant
say
how
it
stacks
up
against
weihenstphan
and
others
without
side
by
side
tasting
but
this
maisel
gives
seriously
good
competition
we
had
this
with
schlattesplatte
and
mustard
bread
and
there
was
much
merriment
brilliant
poured
a
huge
smooth
bright
white
head
leaves
a
few
thick
strands
of
lace
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
in
from
the
aroma
but
i
got
some
nice
banana
and
bubble
gum
maybe
its
just
the
light
golden
color
but
the
flavor
seems
to
be
a
toned
down
version
of
a
hefe
sounds
about
right
for
the
style
so
far
light
almost
crisp
flavors
of
bubble
gum
and
a
bit
of
zesty
wheat
and
lemon
towards
the
finish
a
little
flavor
hangs
around
through
the
finish
tempting
me
to
take
another
sip
light
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
fine
fizz
as
i
swallow
a
delicate
weizen
not
for
those
looking
for
a
beer
bursting
with
flavor
but
then
thats
not
a
bad
thing
either
filtered
to
within
an
inch
of
its
life
pours
like
a
perfect
wheat
rich
burnished
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
though
slightly
coarser
than
id
like
buttery
bananas
on
the
nose
that
carries
through
to
the
flavour
along
with
a
hint
of
caramel
carbonation
is
moderate
and
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
quite
refreshing
but
perhaps
a
little
too
aged
it
is
a
fruity
weiss
that
speaks
to
me
of
summer
time
refreshment
and
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
an
easydrinking
beer
that
would
be
best
in
the
summer
not
hefty
or
flavorful
enough
for
winter
drinking
taste
is
of
light
wheat
malt
a
little
grassiness
and
some
esters
finish
is
dry
and
clean
with
some
fruitiness
lingering
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
head
head
retention
is
pretty
good
smells
malty
with
banana
notes
hints
of
banana
and
cloves
come
out
in
the
flavor
plenty
of
bready
malts
too
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
lightmedium
body
everything
i
look
for
in
a
german
wheat
beer
is
there
minus
the
yeast
a
very
german
and
tasty
wheat
beer
i
ussually
go
for
the
unfilteredwheat
beers
but
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
goes
great
with
any
heavy
meal
pale
sunshine
gold
shining
all
clear
1cm

big

bouquet
bready
crisp

obvious

combo
works
rather
well
not
much
to
seek
further
into
lively
carbonation
thin
body
this
is
so
simple
its
not
very
funny
i
wouldnt
think
theres
a
market
for
this
but
its
worth
trying
one
50cl
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
fairly
large
white
frothy
head
but
it
did
subside
quickly
quite
a
bit
of
bubbles
in
the
beer
i
get
a
bit
of
clove
and
banana
to
the
nose
a
slightly
lighter
beer
with
notes
of
wheat
banana
and
a
weak
spiciness
maybe
a
touch
of
drynesssourness
in
the
aftertaste
good
but
ill
stick
with
a
regular
hefe
fine
foamy
head
on
a
light
golden
and
transparent
body
the
beers
highly
carbonated
very
good
smell
wheat
banana
citrus
and
sweetness
some
aromas
also
remind
me
of
a
belgian
triple
theres
something
very
surprising
in
the
taste
first
you
get
everything
you
could
expect
from
the
smell
a
refreshing
wheat
aspect
a
nice
banana
flavor
sweet
hints
of
citrus
yeast
and
then
suddenly
it
all
disappears
nothing
remains
and
then
you
get
a
very
very
thin
hoppy
aftertaste
but
its
quickly
gone
too
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
a
dynamic
beer
who
could
use
some
improvements
to
taste
all
in
all
i
liked
it
however
there
are
better
examples
of
kristall
i
find
it
best
to
consume
this
particular
product
well
chilled
as
it
seems
to
add
more
bite
poured
a
rich
looking
yellow
color
with
big
blooming
headsmells
very
yeasty
with
a
little
smokiness
and
a
slight
banana
tinge
in
there
tastes
very
yeasty
to
me
with
some
slight
cloviness
to
itnot
a
real
big
fan
of
the
taste
its
highly
drinkable
but
i
just
didnt
care
for
the
taste
to
much
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
a
thick
white
head
is
present
after
the
pour
too
bad
it
doesnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
a
week
weissen
beer
hints
of
cloves
and
bananas
no
yeast
the
taste
is
good
to
say
the
least
it
matches
the
aroma
pretty
well
for
a
kristall
weisse
it
is
not
bad
maybe
a
beer
for
those
who
do
not
like
the
full
yeast
flavor
of
the
heffe
weisse
i
prefer
the
heffe
weissen
over
a
kristall
any
day
of
the
week
still
a
good
beer
for
a
nice
summer
evining
a
above
average
beer
clear
gold
looks
and
smells
just
as
if
you
filtered
a
hefe
weizen
of
course
kristal
is
exactly
that
the
filtration
of
the
yeast
yields
a
lighter
beer
and
yet
maintains
some
of
the
flavor
characteristics
of
an
unfiltered
weisse
hints
of
lemon
banana
and
clove
gently
interact
to
create
a
light
and
dry
but
tasty
kristalweizen
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
i
could
see
this
doing
fine
as
a
summer
brew
by
and
large
many
us
craft
brewers
model
the
american
wheat
style
after
the
kristall
style
sweetsi
apricoty
flavour
low
bitterness
slight
acidity
quite
light
and
smooth
not
overly
interesting
but
very
drinkable
but
quite
expensive
here
in
australia
for
what
you
get
redback
is
probably
better
at
a
cheaper
price
pale
yellow
clear
and
very
clean
look
with
medium
white
head
rather
large
bubbles
head
is
short
lived
slight
scent
of
vanilla
and
wheat
malt
very
light
tasting
with
little
mouthfeel
tones
of
wheat
malt
and
clove
but
you
are
left
wanting
a
more
profound
impact
overall
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
would
be
good
if
eating
alot
of
food
my
first
of
this
style
got
from
a
trade
pours
a
deep
orange
red
with
large
creamy
head
that
has
just
a
hint
of
orange
color
to
it
aroma
is
strong
pears
wheat
funky
yeast
banana
more
sweet
pears
very
nice
light
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
tastes
like
biting
into
a
fresh
pear
hints
of
cinnamon
that
do
not
overpower
but
supplement
the
beer
very
nicely
not
overly
sweet
at
all
and
is
quite
refreshing
nicely
balanced
brew
that
one
could
drink
all
night
this
is
really
fantastic
really
refreshing
and
drinkable
perfect
pair
for
this
sticky
muggy
summer
night
o
a
nice
beer
my
first
true
kristalweizen
nice
flavors
all
around
well
balanced
perfect
sublime
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
when
this
was
out
this
is
my
last
bottle
i
bought
it
every
time
i
got
a
chance
this
redefines
kristalweizens
for
me
now
i
love
them
as
much
or
more
than
a
hefeweizen
d
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
in
the
style
a
departure
from
your
typical
wheat
offering
but
definitely
worth
a
go
id
have
it
again
great
easy
drinkin
wheat
beer
with
terrific
flavor
well
done
new
glarus
o
another
solid
offering
from
new
glarus
im
still
of
the
opinion
that
they
do
not
make
a
bad
beer
if
you
want
all
the
flavors
of
a
great
hefeweizen
with
a
lighter
body
seek
this
out
o
really
attractive
beer
pleasant
aroma
and
easily
drinkable
havent
had
many
kristalweizens
prior
to
this
but
enjoy
the
style
have
always
been
a
hefeweizen
fan
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
this
is
an
emjoyable
beer
i
see
this
as
a
good
beer
for
late
spring
time
o
like
most
brews
of
new
glarus
this
is
well
crafted
and
one
you
should
try
this
stands
up
to
any
imported
kristal
weizen
prost
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
a
good
mix
of
wheat
spice
and
fruity
esters
the
beer
pours
a
deep
coppergolden
color
with
big
head
of
offwhite
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
darker
then
expected
but
intriguing
none
the
less
malty
sweetness
comes
out
strong
but
settles
as
other
aromas
including
wheat
spice
banana
clove
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
join
the
party
the
pallet
experiences
many
of
the
typical
hefeweizen
flavors
of
banana
wheat
clove
and
lemon
zest
while
new
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
biscuity
malt
dance
underneath
spot
on
mouthfeel
for
the
style
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
another
new
glarus
brew
another
rave
review
not
just
a
coincidence
overall
i
am
real
impressed
with
this
one
unique
brew
and
a
great
play
on
a
classic
old
school
german
style
that
is
american
crafty
id
drink
this
often
in
the
summer
if
i
could
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
really
goes
down
easy
and
has
the
taste
i
expect
from
this
style
wheat
beers
are
one
of
my
favorites
and
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
fine
representation
of
a
hefe
style
beer
aroma
and
taste
remind
me
of
banana
bread
with
cinnamon
streusel
topping
great
malt
profile
and
taste
is
off
the
charts
in
the
fresh
grain
and
malt
category
i
cant
see
how
they
could
improve
on
this
one
very
much
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
style
but
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
representations
out
there
its
definitely
the
best
ive
had
a
o
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
good
fruit
and
belgian
notes
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
good
sized
light
beige
head
on
it
it
didnt
linger
long
but
did
leave
some
lacing
it
has
an
interesting
nose
there
is
a
slight
sourness
to
it
get
some
apples
in
there
along
with
some
faint
banana
faint
hints
of
clove
and
cinnamon
also
a
touch
of
wheat
the
taste
is
very
good
a
hint
of
sourness
to
it
wheat
some
of
the
clove
and
cinnamon
faint
apple
and
banana
an
excellent
beer
not
your
typical
kristalweizen
but
immensely
enjoyable
and
another
great
offering
from
what
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
loads
of
bananas
and
bread
especially
in
the
taste
also
a
good
amount
of
fruit
and
apples
to
it
and
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
it
again
this
beer
poured
out
much
darker
than
i
expected
the
color
of
this
beer
was
a
nice
looking
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
moderate
and
not
much
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
much
like
a
traditional
weizen
brew
there
is
an
additional
caramel
sweetness
in
there
too
the
taste
has
the
typical
banana
and
clove
upfront
with
a
very
nice
sweet
malt
finish
very
nice
flavor
on
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
decent
carbonation
light
bodied
drinkable
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
think
id
like
it
as
much
as
i
did
for
a
mild
easy
drinker
this
is
a
great
beer
smooth
but
plenty
of
personality
here
oa
solid
brew
although
not
as
prefered
as
some
other
unfiltered
versions
i
think
id
rather
drink
the
unfiltered
versions
that
have
a
little
more
creaminess
and
stronger
clove
notes
o
definitely
an
afternoonevening
beer
and
great
for
a
fall
picnic
or
campfire
my
first
kristalweizen
so
i
wasnt
expecting
the
slight
cleaning
solution
flavor
of
the
phenols
but
somehow
it
manages
to
be
pleasant
o
great
looking
beer
smells
show
a
good
depth
of
complexity
flavor
is
huge
on
wheat
and
hefelike
carbonation
works
well
and
has
perfect
feel
another
great
beer
by
new
glarus
overall
this
is
a
cut
above
most
american
wheat
beers
new
glarus
makes
the
best
beers
in
the
u
s
a
when
will
they
sell
in
chicago
a
departure
from
my
usual
and
i
found
it
enjoyable
overall
dan
and
deb
give
a
nice
twist
on
a
classic
bavarianstyle
kristall
wheat
beer
big
props
for
the
darkerthanusual
color
and
although
it
has
all
the
required
components
of
a
classic
german
wheat
beer
i
dont
think
im
lying
when
i
say
that
there
is
some
at
least
a
hint
of
smokerauch
in
this
too
very
good
indeed
o
i
really
liked
this
offering
from
ng
definitely
not
just
a
filtered
version
of
dancing
man
a
unique
beer
of
its
own
and
one
i
could
definitely
throw
back
a
few
of
what
exactly
about
this
beer
makes
it
a
kristalweizen
is
this
from
the
same
brewery
that
makes
dancing
man
why
not
make
that
into
a
kristal
what
is
this
thing
i
had
assumed
it
was
another
boring
amber
until
someone
told
me
it
as
a
kristal
and
then
i
sort
of
went
crazy
railing
against
the
beer
i
know
it
is
open
to
interpretation
but
seriously
it
is
red
it
is
uncarbonated
the
yeast
and
the
wheat
dont
come
through
there
is
nearly
nothing
about
this
beer
that
tells
me
that
it
is
a
kristal
pours
a
medium
goldencopper
color
not
sure
how
a
kristalweizen
ends
up
this
way
but
its
far
far
too
dark
short
white
head
the
nose
carries
some
light
yeasty
notes
plus
a
bit
of
grain
not
too
much
going
on
the
flavor
is
is
similar
with
a
bit
too
much
bready
malt
coming
through
body
is
medium
and
a
bit
heavy
the
beer
is
dark
golden
colored
with
a
lasting
white
head
too
dark
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
similar
to
a
dunkel
weizen
with
wheat
and
some
dark
fruit
presence
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
i
would
prefer
a
lighter
color
and
body
with
less
malt
presence
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
of
this
style
overall
this
was
just
ok
m
very
juicy
with
great
mouth
coating
tingly
carbonation
and
pleasant
aftertaste
fun
different
than
average
fallwinter
beer
might
need
another
sample
of
this
one
seems
out
of
character
for
ng
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
that
seems
like
it
was
designed
for
cool
nights
around
the
campfire
with
a
smore
dangling
over
the
coals
very
nice
sessionable
beer

i
really
do
understand
why
people
like
wheat
beers
but
theyre
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
especially
the
german
style
examples
that
feature
the
estery
yeast
notes
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
appetizing
with
notes
of
clove
and
banana
bread
some
fresh
fruity
notes
are
deposited
on
the
palate
as
the
lively
copperhued
brew
moves
through
the
mouth
the
flavors
are
nice
and
fresh
with
orchard
fruit
and
spice
its
earthy
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
another
nice
beer
from
the
folks
at
new
glarus
poured
into
a
tall
weizen
glass
this
beer
pours
with
a
massive
amount
of
foam
which
dissipates
to
leave
a
thick
beige
head
capping
off
a
clear
dark
amber
beer
this
is
darker
than
i
had
anticipated
but
its
a
good
color
to
go
with
the
fox
moniker
sweet
aromas
stand
out
banana
clove
sugar
cookies
mellow
feel
carbonation
is
lowtomoderate
sweet
banana
bread
mild
caramel
clove
bready
finish
this
was
an
easy
drinker
sweet
beer
that
was
refreshing
and
uplifting
not
a
goto
for
me
but
a
pleasant
beer
anyways
overall
for
the
style
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
despite
the
appearance
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
very
traditional
hefeweizen
i
thought
the
filering
would
change
the
flavor
but
this
still
has
the
flavor
of
a
traditional
german
hefeweizen
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
o
a
really
nice
surprise
of
a
beer
never
really
had
anything
like
it
before
so
im
very
partial
to
it
great
flavors
great
lookingsmelling
no
complaints
in
any
department
toasted
grains
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
up
front
banana
and
bread
dough
flavors
follow
framed
by
hints
of
clove
bubblegum
and
peppery
hops
yeasty
doughy
finish
with
lingering
banana
mediumbodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
another
great
wheat
beer
from
new
glarus
o
like
a
hefe
this
is
delicious
very
session
able
a
great
brew
from
ng
overall
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
noninsipid
flavor
smallish
head
with
no
sediment
definitely
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
creamy
masking
the
flavor
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
bit
bolder
in
flavor
theres
a
little
bit
of
clove
spice
going
on
but
no
banana
or
cinnamon
as
it
warms
up
a
little
and
degasses
its
more
enjoyable
nice
beer
o
the
empty
glass
showing
the
foxs
quick
departure
is
coated
with
lace
and
leaves
a
nice
flavor
lingering
on
my
palate
laughing
fox
like
all
other
wheat
beers
from
new
glarus
is
outstanding
just
world
class
surprisingly
toasty
cunningly
balanced
and
delicious
all
around
its
a
great
seasonal
with
plenty
of
character
super
session
ale
right
here
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
grows
on
me
seems
a
little
dark
for
the
style
definitely
a
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
thanks
to
crass3000
for
this
one
o
overall
a
fine
brew
a
nice
example
of
banana
esters
developed
purely
from
yeast
paired
with
fulfilling
bread
and
a
bit
of
spicy
clove
yum
o
a
very
well
made
take
on
a
seldom
seen
style
has
all
the
characteristics
youd
expect
in
a
bavarian
hefeweizen
without
the
cloudy
yeast
o
clean
slick
and
smooth
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
nothing
super
special
about
this
one
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
vigorous
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
head
of
fizzy
white
lace
took
several
pours
before
the
entire
bottle
could
be
released
in
a
very
tall
glass
lots
of
carbonation
was
apparent
from
the
start
through
the
absolutely
flawless
crystal
clear
nature
of
it
no
sediment
and
no
haze
at
all
head
settled
down
to
just
a
thin
film
and
that
lasted
throughout
but
leaving
copious
side
lace
smell
was
very
light
almost
non
existent
at
first
but
then
some
nice
grain
aromas
broke
though
with
a
touch
of
yeast
to
add
light
flavor
as
well
just
a
nice
light
wheat
flavor
is
really
all
that
can
be
said
about
it
mouth
feel
was
again
very
light
with
ample
carbonation
it
went
down
like
water
huge
session
ale
here
this
had
all
the
earmarks
of
a
hot
summer
day
in
the
backyard
brew
this
is
the
final
bottle
in
the
6pack
the
other
five
made
no
impression
on
me
really
and
at
this
last
one
i
feel
i
wont
be
missing
it
new
glarus
continues
to
be
a
brewery
that
misses
almost
as
much
as
hits
with
me
but
the
hits
deserve
their
accolades
dont
get
me
wrong
this
one
eh
overall
im
really
not
sure
how
to
rate
this
at
first
from
the
appearance
and
smell
i
had
highhopes
but
the
taste
was
so
subtle
and
almost
bland
for
me
that
im
not
really
a
fan
at
first
tasting
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
most
wheat
beers
but
i
always
come
in
with
an
open
mind
this
is
a
very
clean
very
drinkable
beer
solid
if
not
particularly
memorable
omy
wife
picked
this
up
for
me
and
when
i
saw
it
was
sort
of
filtered
hefewiezen
i
wasnt
sure
i
would
like
it
since
i
dont
care
for
most
hefeweizen
but
i
was
suprised
to
find
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
love
a
good
take
on
a
more
traditional
style
and
new
glarus
usually
pulls
it
off
better
than
anyone
and
this
is
no
exception
very
good
beer
pours
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
scent
is
full
of
wheats
with
a
slight
bitter
scent
mixed
with
bananas
the
taste
has
a
similar
taste
that
reminds
me
of
biting
into
an
apple
i
know
there
is
a
lot
of
wheat
to
this
beer
but
im
getting
more
apple
tasting
hints
this
is
a
smooth
tasty
brew
that
is
a
great
drink
for
the
fall
harvest
weather
o
a
good
beer
nothing
special
light
tasty
sessionable
i
cant
say
that
ive
had
many
examples
of
this
style
but
i
certainly
can
say
that
i
enjoy
this
example
o
a
refreshing
very
light
brew
a
good
quaffer
with
some
complexity
d
solid
wheat
beer
packed
with
lots
of
flavor
in
all
of
the
right
places
with
a
nice
look
and
aroma
as
well
too
bad
i
only
have
one
bottle
of
this
as
i
would
love
to
drink
some
more
of
this
drinkability
not
bad
but
the
smell
is
much
better
than
the
taste
i
feel
like
its
sort
of
boring
almost
like
its
washed
out
one
flavor
needs
to
shine
a
bit
more
than
the
other
but
neither
does
glad
i
tried
but
not
my
favorite
when
i
think
of
fall
wheat
beers
like
kristalweizens
dont
tend
to
come
to
mind
but
the
combination
of
50
wisconsin
red
wheat
seems
to
work
here
and
gives
this
beer
a
little
heartier
feel
in
both
taste
and
certainly
appearance
to
match
the
cooler
weather
impressive
autumn
release
o
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
falls
short
for
new
glarus
if
youre
a
big
wheat
beer
fan
certainly
pick
it
up
otherwise
its
still
good
just
not
a
must
try
bottle
from
reillys
in
madison
pours
a
gigantic
white
head
on
light
orange
body
retained
onehalf
inch
of
head
spicy
slightly
yeasty
aroma
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
above
average
taste
is
spicy
and
catchy
a
little
yeasty
nothing
like
i
expected
it
was
most
drinkable
got
good
cinammon
d
overall
yet
another
tasty
beer
from
new
glarus
with
their
typical
subtle
twists
on
a
traditional
style
o
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
flavorful
weizen
beer
this
is
my
first
kristalweizen
so
i
dont
really
have
a
point
of
reference
i
imagine
its
not
much
different
from
a
hefe
or
dunkelweizen
just
somewhere
in
between
with
the
color
laughing
fox
pours
a
deeper
golden
color
with
a
big
lacing
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
spices
and
has
a
nice
sweet
note
the
taste
has
a
very
full
spice
and
belgin
candy
flavor
very
crisp
and
very
full
nice
carbonation
very
clean
crisp
flavor
overall
i
had
no
clue
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
it
is
like
a
strong
belgin
whit
beir
but
much
crisper
and
stronger
sugar
notes
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
a
very
interesting
wellrounded
beer
have
not
had
many
examples
of
this
style
but
by
acting
as
a
unique
and
wellbalanced
beer
this
beer
seems
to
paint
a
picture
of
the
style
should
be
overall
a
very
solid
brew
im
not
very
experienced
with
the
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
pretty
delicious
germanstyle
beer
from
a
brewery
i
loveid
certainly
stock
up
on
this
if
i
could

an
all
around
great
beer
new
glarus
wielding
local
wheat
with
this
one
they
just
raised
and
alterer
the
bar
for
the
kristalweizen
style
do
this
amberweizen
beer
smells
convincing
enough
yet
never
really
is
able
to
build
much
momentum
in
its
flavor
profile
certain
features
stand
out
such
as
the
slight
savory
roast
at
the
end
but
no
part
really
wows
it
could
be
a
really
worthy
beer
for
cooking
and
its
sessionable
nature
means
that
it
is
easy
on
the
palate
if
not
particularly
compelling
tastes
a
bit
more
substantial
the
same
cinnamon
flavor
of
spotted
cow
only
applied
to
peppery
wheat
malt
nice
crisp
and
warm
but
nothing
too
fancy
or
adventurous
also
a
bit
too
fizzy
and
that
cuts
into
the
flavor
a
tad
d
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
an
outstanding
version
of
the
style
overall
new
had
a
kristalweizen
beer
but
i
trust
that
new
glarus
did
this
beer
style
the
right
way
enjoyable
beer
easy
drinking
beer
would
not
mind
having
this
year
round
pours
a
beautiful
bright
orange
with
a
thick
three
finger
head
lots
of
exuberant
carbonation
translucent
body
modest
head
retention
and
lacing
estery
strong
dark
fruit
berry
like
aromas
ethyl
acetate
subtle
giner
spicy
mild
caramel
tastes
as
it
smells
grainy
backbone
more
pronounced
lots
of
fruity
berry
and
banana
esters
spicy
a
bit
tart
and
piquant
in
the
finish
good
body
a
bit
cloying
and
alkaline
im
impressed
what
a
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
mild
sunday
evening
a
nice
creamy
head
delivers
in
a
mediumbodied
and
well
carbonated
avalanche
of
tamed
wheat
clove
cinnamon
banana
corn
and
a
tad
of
aged
cheddar
cheese
really
cant
get
enough
of
these
great
new
glarus
brews
this
brewery
is
really
showing
that
it
can
be
calculated
balanced
and
masterful
in
its
measurements
in
addition
to
creative
artistic
and
extreme
absolutely
recommend
this
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
very
large
3
finger
foamy
frothy
white
head
very
fruit
belgian
yeast
aroma
in
the
nose
with
bubblegum
banana
pear
and
clove
medium
mouthfeel
with
lively
carbonation
sweet
fruity
upfront
flavors
with
a
more
than
expected
bitterness
popping
in
caramel
notes
as
well
end
dryly
with
a
linger
bubblegum
and
bitter
aftertaste
laces
the
glass
o
this
is
pretty
darn
good
i
had
a
few
folks
compare
this
to
dancing
man
wheat
this
is
not
as
good
but
if
dancing
man
isnt
available
this
would
be
an
acceptable
plan
b
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
easily
and
doing
so
nearly
year
round
except
for
the
bitter
cold
winter
months
another
solid
beer
by
ng
clear
copper
colored
body
nice
beige
head
leaves
some
nice
lace
very
nice
aroma
weizen
yeast
properties
like
banana
and
clove
come
through
nicely
a
little
cinnamon
too
mouthfeel
is
just
a
titch
gaseous
nothing
too
serious
though
light
in
body
flavor
is
decent
the
clove
adn
cinnamon
come
out
in
the
flavor
slightly
as
well
bready
malt
base
with
some
yeast
notes
as
well
good
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
will
recommend
im
enjoying
the
6pack
i
picked
up
even
though
this
is
octoberfest
season
i
might
not
be
the
most
well
versed
in
this
style
but
i
have
had
enough
hefeweizen
to
know
that
this
guy
is
delicious
once
again
new
glarus
has
shown
that
they
are
the
us
king
of
classic
german
styles
as
i
mentioned
above
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
certainly
sit
down
and
session
i
recommend
any
beer
fans
give
this
a
sampling
o
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
and
considering
the
strength
cant
say
id
regret
it
not
way
out
there
but
very
clean
and
fairly
well
balanced
perfect
summer
session
beer
dont
know
why
they
released
this
one
just
as
fall
was
approaching
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
pretty
drinkable
with
fairly
mild
flavors
i
think
of
it
as
an
introduction
to
dancing
man
its
not
up
to
par
with
the
other
new
glarus
wheat
beers
in
terms
of
flavor
and
enjoyment
but
its
not
disappointing
either
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
another
good
offering
from
new
glarus
although
not
in
my
top
10
o
light
is
the
name
of
the
game
its
a
masterpiece
of
lightness
not
thinking
of
calories
great
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
brew
a
nice
welcoming
beer
with
a
substantial
body
while
holding
a
very
nice
weizen
presence
very
nicely
done
will
be
returning
to
this
one
many
times
ill
have
to
try
this
and
dancing
man
back
to
back
to
decide
which
i
prefer
but
the
fact
that
its
even
close
says
volumes
about
this
beer
the
lower
abv
gives
it
a
boost
for
me
dancing
mans
slightly
punchier
flavor
is
in
its
favor
absolutely
wonderful
i
wonder
if
theres
any
chance
that
theyll
do
this
one
year
round
o
meh
i
like
new
glarus
but
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
bought
a
6
pack
hopefully
i
can
do
some
trading
in
my
homebrew
club
for
it
pours
a
clear
yellowish
orange
a
bit
of
light
head
smells
wheaty
and
yeasty
smells
very
sweet
tastes
sweet
and
yeasty
love
the
taste
and
aroma
clean
and
very
enjoyable
good
mouthfeel
overall
quite
enjoyable

great
beer
in
my
book
unique
taste
and
real
easy
drinking
although
i
would
rather
have
the
older
brother
unplugged
imperial
weizen
since
it
has
more
of
a
warming
sensation
and
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
perfect
for
those
who
want
to
taste
something
new
with
a
couple
friends
yeah
this
is
really
good
its
got
a
clean
buoyant
natural
vibe
that
just
screams
all
right
in
the
world
as
you
sip
on
it
all
in
all
this
beer
is
an
awesome
release
from
new
glarus
i
highly
recommend
picking
this
one
up
because
if
there
is
one
thing
new
glarus
does
exceptionally
well
besides
their
fruit
beers
is
their
wheat
beers
i
just
wish
they
would
not
have
ceased
production
of
crackd
wheat
do
highly
drinkable
beer
but
not
enough
flavor
to
drop
everything
and
seekout
refreshing
and
quiteenjoyed
a
lot
not
wellversed
on
this
style
so
take
these
ratings
with
a
grain
of
salt
not
super
duper
true
to
style
but
for
the
style
it
isnt
bad
very
refreshing
pick
this
up
overall
who
ever
described
this
as
a
dancing
man
light
was
right
on
a
lower
abv
beer
packed
full
of
flavor
i
keep
getting
a
very
distinct
aroma
of
fresh
cut
green
apple
slices
hovering
under
the
heavy
blanket
of
clovecinnamon
spiced
weizen
wheatbready
goodness
also
noted
this
one
is
not
nearly
as
heavy
on
the
banana
notes
in
the
nose
as
new
glaruss
other
weizens
typically
are
taste
is
solidly
wheatey
and
mediumlow
in
yeastiness
but
really
that
is
plenty
enough
to
compliment
the
delicate
dry
mead
and
apple
tones
i
keep
picking
up
here
and
there
in
some
beers
i
understand
apple
flavors
and
scents
are
considered
to
be
an
offflavor
but
it
fits
so
well
in
this
brew
that
i
cannot
imagine
it
wasnt
done
on
purpose
finish
is
not
particularly
long
per
se
but
it
is
enjoyably
dry
while
it
lasts
light
in
body
really
easy
to
session
at
4
5
abv
but
one
should
take
the
time
to
appreciate
the
tiny
subtleties
held
within
light
bodied
slowly
effervescent
a
dancing
man
light
a
nice
quaffer
that
still
rings
with
the
hallmarks
of
new
glarus
excellent
weizen
heritage
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
pours
brilliantly
clear
copper
with
a
thick
ample
offwhite
beautiful
the
nose
is
dominated
by
bountiful
spice
and
clove
yeast
character
with
some
sweet
malt
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
like
the
nose
but
much
more
subdued
the
yeast
character
is
subdued
yet
still
noticeable
with
some
bready
sweet
malt
in
the
background
the
beer
finishes
pleasantly
dry
given
the
wonderfully
strong
nose
i
expected
more
bodymouthfeel
it
doesnt
need
to
be
chewy
but
it
just
misses
as
too
thin
and
this
even
with
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
a
beautiful
great
smelling
beer
while
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
subdued
and
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
refreshing
beer
d
a
solid
beer
that
would
make
a
nice
summer
thirst
quencher
o
its
hard
to
knock
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
measure
up
compared
to
some
of
dans
other
wheats
with
that
said
this
would
be
a
decent
substitution
for
anyone
looking
for
dancing
man
with
a
lower
alcohol
contentbut
who
would
want
that
another
under
appreciated
from
a
small
montana
brewery
here
not
sure
it
fits
the
style
guidelines
its
listed
under
here
not
much
german
about
it
and
the
yeast
isnt
right
for
that
but
i
love
it
just
the
same
it
has
a
great
nose
and
taste
fairly
sweet
and
rich
yet
clean
and
dynamic
with
what
appears
to
be
a
wheat
malt
base
and
a
nice
clean
light
clave
punctuated
by
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
bright
almost
belgian
fruitiness
pears
and
yeast
in
the
finish
either
a
little
residual
sugar
creamy
texture
and
a
bubble
feel
better
than
anything
i
have
had
from
these
guys
so
far
a
soso
beer
that
tastes
okay
but
lacks
defining
weizen
beer
character
the
honeylike
sweetness
is
at
the
fore
yet
there
is
little
if
any
banana
or
clovelike
presence
uninspiring
i
detect
a
fruity
aroma
with
a
kiss
of
floral
hops
a
fruityhoney
and
spicy
taste
is
quite
noticeable
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
mead
undertones
of
melon
and
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
banana
are
apparent
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
the
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
o
a
fairly
unexciting
yet
easy
drinking
massappeal

although
this
beer
is
much
too
cloudy
to
be
considered
a
traditional
kristalweizen
it
did
have
the
flavor
profile
subtle
and
simple
clove
and
banana
notes
made
this
a
solid
summer
drinker
that
will
offend
few
hopefully
many
yellowstone
tourists
will
give
this
a
try
and
save
some
trout
in
the
process
o
good
beer
really
sessionable
would
love
to
see
this
one
in
a
can
overall
this
is
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
brew
perfect
for
a
perfect
labor
day
weekend
in
western
montana
definitely
a
lot
denser
and
lacking
the
crispness
ive
come
to
expect
for
the
style
that
said
its
still
enjoyable
as
it
is
if
youre
looking
for
a
just
offcenter
skewed
towards
the
malty
wheat
beer
o
this
beer
just
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
im
not
sure
if
the
cidery
taste
was
intended
or
not
but
that
definitely
played
a
role
in
the
soso
experience
i
see
i
should
have
tried
their
schwarzbier
dammit
this
beer
fullfills
the
light
easy
drinking
beverage
role
nicely
d
a
nice
brew
id
have
another
if
i
only
didnt
live
so
far
away
i
picked
up
a
bottle
at
princetons
in
an
effort
to
try
the
bayern
beers
available
this
one
wasnt
a
beer
to
write
home
about
its
one
of
the
most
bland
wheat
beers
ive
had
even
considering
that
this
is
a
kristalweizen
theres
a
faint
wheat
cracker
taste
and
an
indistinct
sweet
bready
barley
i
guess
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
crowdpleaser
but
im
not
a
fan
never
have
understood
the
reason
for
kristalweizen
kind
of
a
pointless
genre
i
have
no
frame
of
reference
except
north
american
filtered
wheat
beer
to
judge
this
with
and
as
a
kristalweizen
i
suppose
this
is
acceptable
no
off
tastes
well
made
but
just
pointless
notes
of
toffee
malts
overly
filtered
with
no
fruity
esters
or
phenols
no
hop
balance
a
tad
bland
and
thin
with
a
sweet
finish
not
my
cup
of
t
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
an
extremely
shortlived
white
head
and
no
lacing
smells
a
lot
better
than
it
looks
light
wheat
and
clove
with
lots
of
subtle
fruity
notes
pears
peaches
apple
cider
tastes
rather
fruity
as
well
reminscent
of
baked
pears
and
banana
pudding
plenty
of
light
malts
and
wheat
flavor
a
small
lemony
hop
bite
at
the
swallow
finishes
a
tad
grainy
light
and
crisp
with
the
exception
of
a
bit
of
lingering
doughy
sweetness
not
a
bad
little
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
straw
with
a
small
bit
of
white
bubbly
head
that
laces
fairly
nicely
the
smell
is
weak
though
watereddown
hints
of
banana
and
wheat
are
there
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
with
a
bit
of
a
musty
flavor
constantly
interfering
touches
of
yeastiness
spring
up
but
dont
really
make
themselves
known
the
body
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
expected
but
is
still
light
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
too
much
overall
this
is
a
fairly
average
brew
and
i
just
could
not
get
too
far
into
it
d
decent
drinkability
nothing
harsh
just
a
little
off
balance
i
had
a
couple
of
these
earlier
in
the
night
and
am
a
little
disappointed
i
swear
this
brew
should
not
come
anywhere
close
to
the
kristalweizen
category
not
anything
german
that
i
can
come
up
with
much
more
like
an
american
pale
wheat
that
said
its
pretty
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
would
be
a
descent
lawnmower
beer
if
it
was
available
here
d
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
tad
to
sweet
but
i
think
it
would
make
a
nice
hot
weather
beer
that
has
a
little
more
body
than
others
smooth
light
bodied
not
as
full
bodied
as
some
hefes
and
the
finish
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
well
with
a
spicy
backdrop
of
clove
and
ginger
alongside
crystal
malt
grassy
hops
and
light
fruity
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lighter
version
of
a
hefeweizen
notsurprisingly
with
a
thin
wellcarbonated
body
that
is
somewhat
refreshing
and
crisp
on
the
finish
although
this
beer
could
use
a
little
oomph
to
it
it
seems
to
rep
the
style
decently
and
it
performed
amicably
as
a
refreshing
beer
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
i
really
didnt
care
for
the
is
beer
at
all
the
aroma
was
a
subdued
banana
smell
the
taste
was
like
the
hefe
and
left
a
spiciness
on
the
tongue
it
was
fairly
bitter
which
made
it
a
little
abrasive
in
the
mouth
the
label
was
quite
interesting
as
the
trout
looked
as
though
it
was
whispering
sweet
nothings
into
the
fishermans
ear
and
had
a
best
before
date
and
serving
temperature
but
after
the
art
work
this
was
just
an
okay
brew
notes
from
11307
goes
down
easily
enough
but
not
in
a
terribly
memorable
way
perhaps
of
use
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
not
for
anything
else
taste
is
smooth
yet
watery
a
little
tart
up
front
some
grain
some
yeast
wheat
a
little
citrus
ends
tangy
on
the
tongue
and
slightly
dry
pours
a
clear
caramel
amber
with
a
light
golden
highlights
not
much
of
a
head
and
a
very
mediocre
bubbles
the
aroma
has
some
funky
german
hops
and
a
touch
of
old
bananas
the
taste
starts
with
some
light
banana
bready
banas
with
a
quick
crisp
finish
great
summer
beer
d
if
this
suits
you
its
very
drinkable
and
good

allnighters
dancing
trout
ale
is
a
german
wheat
ale
the
filtered
version
of
a
true
bavarian
hefeweizen
in
bavaria
this
beer
would
be
called
a
kristallweizen
crystalwheat
because
of
its
clarity
dancing
trout
ale
is
brewed
with
malted
wheat
pale

you

that
has

of
28
days
versus

the
average
ale
drinkability
a
bit
too

but

wiped
clean
bayern
dancing
trout
ale
sounds
like
it
might
be
a
big
seller
for
these
guys
thats
a
hard
one
to
figure
because
i
find
it
to
be
bland
and
instantly
forgettable
if
youre
into
summer
beers
or
golden
ales
this
will
likely
appeal
to
you
more
than
it
does
to
me
on
a
36f
degree
night
with
high
winds
and
stinging
rain
its
definately
a
summer
beer
but
not
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
when
the
days
get
longer
d
this
beer
goes
down
easily
however
there
is
nothing
that
stands
out
about
it
really
d
goes
down
easily
but
its
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
that
probably
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
style
too
d
this
isnt
too
bad
a
nice
american
effort
at
a
german
brew
a
nice
wheat
ale
german
yeast
makes
it
a
bit
of
a
crossover
between
american
wheat
ale
the
bavarian
style
hefe
smells
of
tangy
wheat
and
bubblegum
mostly
some
light
spice
as
well
perhaps
very
enticing
tastes
every
bit
as
good
as
it
smells
sweettangy
wheat
dominates
with
enough
bubblegum
and
banana
to
keep
me
thinking
as
it
warms
light
flowery
spice
and
citrus
emerge
god
i
love
a
good
wheat
beer
the
only
negative
for
was
that
the
carbonation
level
seemed
a
bit
low
ramp
it
up
and
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
ive
got
to
say
im
really
digging
this
so
well
crafted
and
so
drinkable
this
would
be
great
to
session
i
feared
that
having
so
many
cooks
in
the
kitchen
might
hurt
this
brew
but
my
fears
were
unfounded
delicious
wonderful
beer
all
you
could
ask
for
from
a
wheat
ale
made
with
top
quality
pilsner

really
a
solid
effort
and
a
worthy
representative
for
bellingham
beer
week
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
this
could
be
the
only
domestic
krisalweizen
i
have
had
and
it
is
world
class
thank
you
beertunes
for
the
chance
to
try
this
beer

would
drink
this
everyday
poured
from

into
an
euler
stange
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
to
patchy
foam
and
thin
ring
around
the
glass
no
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
wheat
a
hint
of
citrus
and
an
unexpected
hint
of
caramel
flavor
is
wheat
light
biscuit
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toast
light
lemon
interesting
light
to
medium
bodied
with
peppry
carbonation
an
interesting
take
on
a
weizen
my
glass
had
a
faint
haze
but
certainly
not
as
cloudy
as
a
hefeweizen
dont
remember
if
this
is
typical
of
this
filtered
variety
although
all
the
weizen
characteristic
flavors
are
here
they
seem
to
be
melded
with
a
biscuity
malt
which
is
not
something
ive
noticed
in
a
weizen
before
this
kinda
reminded
me
of
a
kolsch
albeit
a
mildely
weaty
and
citrus
one
not
quite
to
style
but
i
really
liked
the
flavor
here
the
wheatmalt
base
is
pleasant
and
more
substantial
than
i
expected
nicely
done
i
would
gladly
get
this
again
for
a
hot
summer
day
big
thanks
to
beertunes
for
sending
this
one
down
for
me
to
try
not
quite
what
i
want
from
the
style
overall
has
its
attributes
but
overall
is
kind
of
plainboring
o
soso
not
as
good
as
the
unfiltered
weissbier
itself
hardly
the
champion
of
the
style
looks
alright
however
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
a
lacklustre
blend
of
fruity
yeast
notes
and
subtle
wheat
none
of
the
bold
fruitiness
and
spicy
character
that
would
be
expected
from
a
better
weizen
body
is
ok
drinkable
enough
but
equally
forgettable
no
need
to
hunt
it
down
this
seems
to
be
aptly
named
as
it
has
a
crystal
clear
complexion
feel
and
light
clean

find
it
somewhat
uninteresting
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
banana
fruitiness
a
decent
grassy
like
bitterness
follows
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
but
helps
lend
a
dry
finish
necessary
for
this
beer
quite
a
strange
beer
initially
and
started
almost
like
a
pale
lager
with
light
malts
and
very
faint
grassy
hops
before
the
kristalweizen
in
it
started
to
shine
through
not
a
bad
effort
overall
but
there
are
certainly
better
and
more
readily
available
erdinger
beers
out
there
to
be
had
mf
medium
light
body
with
a
dry
finish
4
o
exceptional
and
enjoyable
to
the
end
scent
is
sweet
bready
pours
very
pale
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
very
full
and
thick
white
head
head
lasts
well
and
laces
the
glass
in
fine
drapery
to
the
bottom
taste
is
crisp
honey
lemon
and
biscuits
very
fine
carbonation
no
bitterness
at
all
highly
enjoyable
goes
down
so
so
so
easy
very
drinkable
smooth
no
bitterness
light
beery
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
for
hot
weather
and
grilled
food
overall
a
decent
wheat
beer
but
far
from
the
best
i
have
had
nice
to
pick
up
every
once
and
a
while
for
a
change
of
pace
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
sugar
and
slight
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
slight
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
somewhat
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
pretty
lacking
in
traditional
weizen
aromas
and
flavors
even
for
the
style
this
is
a
great
kristalweizen
poured
from
a
550
ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
fluted
glass
best
by
072012
this
pours
a
massive
head
in
fact
the
entire
18oz
glass
if
nothing
but
head
right
now
as
it
dissipates
it
turns
a
clear
pale
light
yellow
color
the
smells
are
of
yeast
esters
banana
and
wheat
the
feel
is
mostly
light
the
taste
is
okay
its
pretty
light
and
refreshing
but
light
taste
and
no
hop
presence
not
enough
flavors
for
my
usual
preference
perhaps
this
would
be
okay
on
a
warm
summer
day
not
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
tried
but
not
bad
either
it
is
refreshing
and
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
wanting
more
a
good
summer
beer
o
disappointed
with
this
german
offering
dont
care
to
try
again
this
is
the
weakest
beer
in
erdingers
portfolio
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
try
urweisse
or
the
dunkel
if
you
want
something
different
i
may
try
this
again
but
only
if
on
tap
pours
a
clear
bright
gold
body
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
is
held
aloft
for
a
long
time
by
highly
active
carbonation
that
gives
the
whole
beer
a
very
lively
appearance
aromas
and
and
taste
are
perfectly
aligned
predominantly
grainy
but
nearly
as
wheaty
as
the
average
hefeweizen
with
very
gentle
hops
lightly
sweet
but
overall
just
not
very
interesting
to
dissect
its
strongest
point
is
its
texture
which
starts
off
tingly
before
breaking
into
a
creamier
mass
of
bubbles
o
a
good
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
for
a
summer
afternoon
o
not
bad
but
i
prefer
weihenstephaner
if
i
had
to
pick
a
kristalweizen
taste
is
light
crisp
fruity
grain
dough
apple
apple
peel
hints
of
herb
lemon
and
mineral
all
very
light
and
ultimately
mostly
dominated
by
mineral
apple
and
hint
of
grassy
citrus
with
the
finish
being
mostly
mineral
and
apple
it
has
a
nice
zesty
feel
is
light
and
crisp
character
is
light
and
rather
simple
but
its
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
with
enough
body
and
character
to
keep
it
going
o
highly
drinkable
kristalweizen
overall
it
seems
okay
to
me
but
not
something
id
want
to
have
again
its
a
pretty
good
brew
that
still
have
some
vitality
and
gusto
even
being
filtered
reminded
me
a
lot
of
some
euro
pale
lagers
ive
had
again
with
a
character
not
unlike
champagne
i
miss
the
smooth
creaminess
of
a
traditional
hefe
though
this
will
do
nothing
too
challenging
about
it
easy
enough
to
drink
though
im
not
sure
id
jump
at
the
chance
to
try
it
again
notes
its
very
drinkable
with
good
clean
wheat
beer
flavor
dr
wont
buy
it
again
wont
have
it
again
wont
speak
of
it
again
a
damned
disappointment
for
erdinger
not
bad
tasting
just
empty
it
should
be
said
that
it
hides
its
abv
well
however
an
easy
drinker
to
start
the
day
off
fairly
persistant
white
head
on
a
clear
gold
body
not
very
unique
smell
is
somewhat
average
a
little
like
corn
taste
is
seet
then
butter
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
leaves
a
slight
pasty
feeling
on
the
palate
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
worth
drinking
a
good
kristal
a
style
which
is
often
overshadowed
by
its
more
favoured
sister
style
the
hefeweizen
this
doesnt
quite
show
it
off
to
its
full
potential
but
its
a
clean
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
good
stuff
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
although
its
not
as
thirst
quenching
as
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
some
honey
highlights
very
much
like
a
macro
however
it
does
have
a
beautiful
rocky
pure
white
head
that
takes
its
time
settling
into
a
cap
leaving
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
blah
sweet
pale
malt
with
a
slight
tin
like
note
the
taste
is
sweet
but
fairly
clean
seems
to
have
a
corn
or
adjuct
type
flavor
and
sweetness
but
none
of
the
gross
aftertaste
any
of
the
yeasty
goodness
has
been
filtered
out
of
this
brew
perhaps
a
very
light
banana
creme
pie
flavor
but
that
is
it
the
weizen
has
a
light
but
not
watery
body
fizzy
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
crisp
feel
sweet
overall
but
not
cloying
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
beer
but
it
is
boring
definitely
needs
some
more
of
the
yeast
flavors
to
come
through
all
in
all
quite
disappointing
to
me
overall
an
easy
and
simple
example
of
the
style
but
it
tastes
a
bit
too
much
of
corn
to
seek
out
again
all
in
all
a
bit
tame
and
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
really
thirst
quenching
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
a
nice
fresh
character
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
d
smooth
refreshing
would
make
a
good
summer
afternoon
drink
but
not
the
best
of
the
breed
by
far
it
does
go
down
quickly
though
d
excellent
drinkability
very
sessionable
slightly
higher
abv
but
nothing
overpowering
definitely
make
sure
to
drink
it
warm
maybe
even
summer
day
warm
and
enjoy
the
prickly
carbonation
this
beer
is
wet
no
dryness
with
it
at
all
a
great
beer
with
high
drinkability
there
is
some
cereal
like
taste
in
the
mid
to
late
palate
no
sweetness
and
some
of
the
ester
notes
come
through
in
the
taste
ive
had
better
krystalweiss
and
hefe
beers
but
this
one
is
a
decent
example
and
overall
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
medium
to
low
bodied
carbonation
is
way
over
the
top
very
prickly
mfd
light
body
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
d
nice
and
refreshing
as
a
wheat
beer
should
be
this
beer
reminds
me
of
macro
light
lagers
without
any
off
flavors
and
with
excellent
head
lacing
and
overall
quality
not
to
mention
it
isnt
a
lager
i
was
about
to
review
it
pretty
low
because
it
is
so
light
but
actually
i
think
this
beer
has
its
own
place
and
is
intended
to
be
exactly
what
it
is
overall
i
think
it
is
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
looks
good
just
dont
expect
what
you
normally
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
too
much
this
beer
is
a
bland
version
of
a
style
that
i
usually
love
kind
of
disappointing
really
but
good
for
pounding
down
in
the
warmer
months
once
again
im
underwhelmed
by
the
kristall
of
a
great
hefe
brewer
and
left
wondering
why
filter
the
yeast
sure
its
nice
to
have
some
variety
in
your
lineup
but
it
just
seems
like
the
backbone
of
the
palate
has
been
sapped
away
and
all
thats
left
is
a
floppy
mess
of
weak
and
wobbly
wheat
beer
nose
has
wheat
and
yeast
on
the
nose
but
is
otherwise
lacking
for
the
style
a
bit
of
ripe
banana
exists
but
is
well
hidden
and
subtle
and
comes
with
a
bit
of
cloaking
malts
a
perky
carbonation
continues
some
noble
hops
and
wheat
hide
a
lager
like
sense
feel
is
more
full
bodied
however
giving
the
beer
a
decent
feel
and
drink
unexciting
in
the
taste
department
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
wanderer
think
weihenstephaner
overall
this
is
a
pretty
filtered
and
bland
hefe
but
i
wouldnt
mind
it
as
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
conclusion
solid
refreshing
my
favorite
of
the
erdinger
lineup
wheat
and
malt
flavors
outduel
the
yeasty
esters
in
this
beer
for
the
most
part
cloves
are
the
foremost
yeast
derivative
on
my
buds
and
has
a
bit
more
spiciness
than
some
other
versions
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
not
as
much
as
the
weihenstephaner

finish
clean
easy
drinking
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
clear
yellow
color
with
great
foamy
head
and
good
lacing
a
good
looking
beer
aroma
was
pretty
faint
just
a
hint
of
citrus
fairly
thin
body
with
some
nice
sweetness
that
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
bitterness
before
finishing
fast
and
clean
overall
a
very
drinkable
if
not
terribly
flavorful
beer
this
tastes
like
a
germans
take
on
a
bud
light
with
more
wheat
pours
fizzy
yellow
with
an
oversized
white
head
corn
wheat
sugar
and
metal
in
the
aroma
wheat
with
very
little
bubblegum
and
clove
flavors
which
quickly
disappear
for
a
lagerlike
finish
it
is
a
very
bright
hay
gold
color
with
good
lacing
and
a
nice
white
head
it
has
a
strong
weizen
aroma
the
usual
cloves
banana
cloves
and
spices
the
taste
strongly
resembles
the
smell
except
there
are
some
citrus
and
floral
esters
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
with
a
little
burn
and
pretty
light
it
is
to
drink
and
a
great
anytime
beer
overall
i
would
prefer
the
weihenstephaner
version
over
this
one
which
is
much
softer
on
the
palate
this
one
is
still
pretty
good
though
this
is
a
near
smooth
and
sweet
tasting
beer
very
refreshing
it
would
be
great
to
cool
down
with
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
prefer
this
one
over
both
the
erdinger
dunkelweizen
and
their
hefe
appearance
poured
a
light
golden
straw
color
with
a
thick
healthy
head
smell
is
like
bread
dough
sweetened
with
light
honey
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
spicey
with
a
hint
of
banana
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
this
is
one
beer
i
would
drink
on
a
warm
evening
simply
sipping
and
enjoying
d
an
easy
but
boring
and
expensive
beer
to
kill
a
night
with
not
bad
a
decent
little
beer
that
could
be
easily
confused
with
a
pilsner
with
too
many
esters
the
wheat
malt
makes
for
a
full
flavored
beer
with
strong
wheat
sweetness
and
a
fresh
raw
grain
flavor
bready
peppery
and
lemony
from
nose
to
finish
hints
of
bubblegum
bananna
and
clove
dance
in
the
background
but
never
gain
prominence
light
hopping
allows
the
grain
bread
flavors
to
become
dominant
lightly
acidic
and
carbonic
to
the
mouth
with
a
clean
refreshing
finish
a
lingering
grain
flavor
keeps
me
from
giving
this
beer
more
of
a
nod
an
easydrinking
thirstquencher
here
balanced
enough
not
to
need
lemonwedges
as
this
is
the
style
that
bavarians
used
to
put
it
into
and
some
americans
think
they
need
to
do
with
hws
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
especially
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
light
that
still
has
some
substance
to
it
sidebyside
comparison
with
their
hefeweizen
halfliter
german
bottle
unpasteurized
with
a
nearexpired
freshness
date
the
beer
is
crystalclear
gold
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
three
fingers
of
white
head
that
retains
well
and
laces
nicely
lightly
sweet
in
the
nose
with
fruits
bubblegum
and
hints
of
wheat
the
flavor
is
very
fruity
with
bubblegum
bready
malts
and
some
late
grassy
hops
it
has
a
light
dry
notquitetingly
body
that
leaves
a
short
finish
interesting
tastes
decent
but
doesnt
really
remind
me
a
whole
lot
of
a
kristall
as
to
the
comparisons
with
the
hefe
this
one
looks
much
better
but
the
other
tastes
more
authentic
neither
are
great
and
they
both
garnered
the
same
score
granted
for
different
reasons
but
the
prices
are
low
enough
to
consider
sampling
them
d
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
good
drinkability
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
clean
but
the
carbonation
is
over
the
top
pretty
refreshing
and
drinkable
d
this
was
not
bad
i
have
others
from
the
brewery
that
was
better
would
not
turn
it
down
but
would
not
go
out
and
buy
it
again
two
fingers
of
dense
white
froth
cap
a
dark
golden
body
very
impressive
hops
mild
fruit
and
yeast
confront
the
nose
but
not
enough
the
taste
is
rather
goodhopped
with
hints
of
bitterness
well
carbonated
this
is
refreshing
and
enjoyablenot
a
wow
beer
but
solid
drinkability
is
good
its
very
quenching
and
disappears
pretty
quickly
overall
seems
to
be
pretty
spot
on
for
a
somewhat
lackluster
style
i
might
drink
this
beer
after
mowing
my
lawn
on
a
really
hot
day
but
that
is
about
the
only
time
this
is
a
disappointment
a
real
yawner
from
an
otherwise
very
good
brewery
in
removing
the
yeast
theyve
also
removed
all
the
rest
of
the
character
almost
no
aroma
very
little
flavor
light
head
and
very
little
lace
the
body
isnt
too
good
either
very
sharp
hard
carbonation
in
the
mouth
its
just
beer
thats
it
and
thats
that
drinks
very
easy
sort
of
a
teutonic
version
of
an
american
pale
wheat
just
kidding
im
sure
the
germans
did
it
first
not
challenging
enough
to
session
on
but
a
few
go
down
very
easy
on
a
coolish
colorado
summers
day
poured
into
weizen
glass
a
spritzy
light
straw
yellow
with
a
large
blooming
white
head
that
settled
very
slowlylight
aromas
lightly
clovey
with
hints
of
apple
and
toasted
grain
extremely
easy
going
down
a
tad
thin
but
not
waterymild
flavors
somewhat
toasty
and
clovey
with
underlying
fruitiness
like
apple
and
banana
a
good
after
work
beer
on
a
hot
day
here
in
the
buffalo
area
today
d
excellent
really
fruity
buttery
and
thirst
quenching
this
was
an
excellent
crossover
beer
for
lagerlovers
who
fear
anything
dark
or
hoppy
my
dad
loved
it
and
actually
considered
buying
something
similar
for
home
consumption
i
may
be
getting
closer
to
converting
him
to
good
beer

yellow
with
a
nice
frothy

body
is
a
little
raw
acidic
and
with
high


aftertaste
of

and

i
like
the
erdinger
weissbier
kristallklar
i
could
see
myself
dinking
this
one
again
cheers
d
perhaps
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
a
wonderful
scent
and
sweet
dry
finish
does
make
it
a
nice
example
of
the
style
but
the
carbonation
in
the
end
would
put
me
off
i
have
had
kristall
weizens
on
tap
in
germany
and
never
found
them
this
carbonated
i
wont
drink
this
kristalweiss
again
but
im
still
open
to
the
style
i
still
love
a
good
wheat
beer
poured
from
a
16
9oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
no
yeast
here
straw
color
with
a
massive
head
that
settles
down
to
a
finger
width
leaving
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
taste
is
like
a
true
weizen
with
out
the
yeast
some
clove
and
banana
flavors
along
with
malty
start
that
ends
with
a
bit
of
hops
mouth
is
good
with
a
great
level
of
carbination
a
drinkable
beer
and
good
intro
to
the
kristal
weizen
style
drinkability
this
was
a
solid
beer
with
certainly
nothing
objectionable
in
the
taste
department
but
the
high
carbonation
and
my
preference
for
taking
my
wheats
hefe
detract
a
bit
that
said
this
could
be
an
excellent
gateway
beer
for
someone
accustomed
to
drinking
highly
carbonated
crystal
clear
amls
an
enjoyable
beer
but
im
a
bigger
fan
of
its
beige
cousin
im
one
who
likes
his
dark
rye
and
pumpernickel
breads
and
flavoursome
buttery
beers
not
just
wonder
white
and
vb
since
this
tends
towards
the
latter
ive
held
back
my
praise
somewhat
drinkability
really
not
bad
a
great
summer
quaffer
this
is
slightly
disappointing
i
enjoy
a
good
hefe
but
this
is
not
quite
the
real
thing
worth
a
try
but
ill
be
sticking
with
the
cloudy
stuff
from
here
on
out
a
clean
pale
yellow
beer
with
plenty
of
cabonation
bubbles
has
a
huge
maybe
too
big
only
had
a
shaker
pint
might
have
better
if
i
had
a
weiss
glass
bright
white
head
with
good
lace
there
are
pleasent
sweet
banana
notes
in
the
aroma
with
some
spicey
clove
in
the
background
the
flavor
was
quite
bland
only
hints
of
banana
and
some
spicey
hops
well
after
the
swallow
i
could
see
where
this
might
be
a
thirst
quenching
lawnmower
beer
but
that
is
the
extent
of
it
bring
on
warm
summer
evenings
where
this
will
excell
this
really
seems
more
of
an
american
style
wheat
beer
than
a
weizen
as
it
lacks
most
of
the
flavors
one
associates
with
weissbier
the
blandest
german
weizen
ive
ever
had
in
fact
damn
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
its
a
good
brew
in
all
aspects
with
the
exception
of
the
most
important
taste
poured
out
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
medium
high
carbonation
and
medium
lace
notes
around
the
glass
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
minor
hints
of
grain
and
some
sweetness
taste
was
just
bland
its
missing
character
some
citrus
notes
and
hints
of
grain
and
grass
but
just
as
im
starting
to
get
a
feel
for
it
its
gone
finished
crisp
and
clean
good
drinkability
but
the
addition
of
solid
flavors
would
really
be
a
perk
in
this
brews
corner
i
must
imagine
there
are
better
kristal
weizens
out
there
still
worth
a
try
but
its
not
a
bad
quaff
on
its
own
so
long
as
you
arent
jonesin
for
anything
really
wheaty
bottle
i
dont
believe
this
finally
a
kristall
that
i
actually
like
better
than
its
hefe
stablemate
looks
good
on
the
pour
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
dense
white
head
and
plenty
of
life
on
the
nose
while
it
is
more
attenuated
in
the
phenols
than
you
would
expect
from
a
hefe
there
is
plenty
of
ester
banana
there
on
top
of
a
good
malty
foundation
the
taste
starts
sweet
and
malty
as
expected
there
is
a
very
slight
hint
of
the
banana
in
the
aroma
and
it
finishes
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
a
little
toastiness
although
it
is
more
subtle
than
you
would
expect
from
a
hefe
this
is
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
balance
the
carbonation
is
much
better
than
the
hefe
version
as
well
which
improves
the
mouthfeel
considerably
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
well
balanced
beer
pours
a
cristal
clear
golden
color
with
great
carbonation
and
moderate
white
head
smell
is
distinctly
crisp
and
hoppy
taste
is
fine
slightly
lemony
very
lightly
spicy
nothing
to
complain
about
a
good
beer
but
i
just
dont
get
excited
about
it
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
that
is
good
anytime
a
good
beer
to
convert
swill
drinkers
with
not
bad
too
filtered
although
it
is
the
style
goes
down
easy
though
very
drinkable
and
good
on
a
hot
day
refreshing
500ml
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
clear
canary
color
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
before
fading
to
ring
and
sheet
lacing
very
impressive
to
view
aroma
is
well
hmmm
if
there
is
an
aroma
its
faint
hints
of
grass
and
pale
malts
mouthfeel
is
average
being
light
bodied
and
very
carbonated
taste
is
puzzling
basically
there
is
none
to
speak
of
other
than
faint
lemony
citrus
wheat
and
something
metallic
its
very
refreshing
for
sure
and
is
easily
drinkable
with
no
offnotes
very
disappointing
considering
how
impressive
it
looks
in
the
glass
i
could
easily
guzzle
a
few
of
these
if
i
were
thirsty
but
i
could
satisy
my
thirst
a
lot
cheaper
with
miller
lite
or
water
appearance
crystal
clear
filtered
hefeweizen
golden
in
color
with
a
frothy
billowing
white
head
lace
is
spread
evenly
in
webbed
patterns
nice
aroma
some
banana
and
clove
scents
survive
the
filtration
sharp
malted
wheat
sharp
sweetness
not
bad
seems
spritzy
and
really
carbonated
taste
hints
of
the
banana
and
clove
with
a
spritzy
wheat
base
flavors
blend
well
together
but
this
one
just
keeps
me
yearning
for
a
more
citrusy
unfiltered
hefe
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
but
does
indeed
lack
body
compared
to
most
wheat
beers
im
accustomed
to
spritzy
extreme
carbonation
very
hard
to
get
a
good
pour
took
some
work
and
patience
drinkability
one
of
the
most
perfect
lawnmower
beers
not
too
complex
in
anyway
just
good
ol
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
was
a
disappointing
beer
from
erdinger
as
it
lacks
flavor
in
my
opinion
it
poured
a
huge
rocky
frothy
white
head
with
a
carbonated
and
clear
body
with
a
yellowgold
hue
the
nose
consisted
of
malt
banana
and
clove
the
flavor
was
sweet
with
a
smooth
and
thin
mouthfeel
poured
from
a
brown
500ml
bottle
thick
white
head
dissappeared
after
a
few
minutes
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
as
the
carbonation
bubbles
in
your
mouth
the
beer
is
light
golden
in
color
its
a
pretty
drinkable
wheat
beer
light
in
flavor
with
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
wow
i
wasnt
quite
expecting
this
all
the
way
around
poured
from
a
500ml
brown
bottle
with
freshness
date
marked
on
back
label
very
crystal
clear
golden
in
appearance
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
for
a
fanfare
stuck
around
a
long
time
receded
to
a
thin
cap
and
left
some
great
lacing
not
cloudy
like
an
average
wheat
ale
but
that
would
be
because
its
kristallklar
crisp
metallic
nose
on
it
and
the
faintest
scent
of
spice
flavour
is
of
sweet
malt
some
banana
hardly
any
trace
of
hops
mouthfeel
may
be
a
little
watery
but
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
could
be
trouble
but
id
almost
be
willing
to
welcome
it
to
think
i
couldnt
even
stand
wheat
beers
some
time
ago
very
drinkable
better
than
most
pilseners
in
my
opinion
but
without
the
yeast
this
weisse
is
boring
and
without
the
classic
benefits
none
of
the
phenols
flavors
or
hangover
protection
of
a
hefeweisse
i
guess
it
serves
its
purpose
a
plain
and
simple
throwitback
beer
this
beer
is
clear
and
pale
but
a
huge
fluffy
head
forms
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
pretty
refreshing
its
like
a
very
mellow
hefeflavor
in
a
way
but
also
very
lagerlike
it
didnt
excite
me
too
much
id
much
rather
drink
a
cloudy
ass
hefeweizen
but
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
cloudless
golden
yellow
to
light
amber
color
the
head
impressive
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
nice
thick
clinging
sheets
to
cover
the
glass
malt
dominated
nose
with
that
refreshing
spritzy
citrus
crisp
and
clean
tone
mostly
malt
at
the
front
slightly
sweet
the
top
skinny
in
feel
the
finish
mellow
in
its
acidity
pleasing
in
its
hop
spicy
bite
dry
lingering
aftertaste
quite
a
refresher
no
matter
the
time
of
year
16
9
oz

notes
a
helluva
beer
and
spot
on
for
the
style
a
clean
clear
tasty
and
very
drinkable
wheat
beer
exactly
what
it
should
be
golden
brew
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
doesnt
go
away
too
soon
it
had
prickly
carbonation
and
like
the
name
said
it
was
crystal
clear
the
beer
was
fairly
dry
up
front
and
had
a
pretty
substantial
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
on
finish
also
there
was
just
a
little
bit
of
hops
for
balance
good
beer
die
prickelnde
frische
translates
to
no
yeast
for
you
after
pouring
this
brew
in
a
glass
it
had
a
golden
hue
with
tight
white
foam
after
that
it
was
all
down
hill
where
was
the
wheat
it
had
no
bitter
taste
but
it
like
drinking
a
type
of
lager
with
no
flavor
pleasent
after
taste
but
after
taste
of
what
first
and
last
time
wheres
the
wheat
tastes
more
lagery
than
anything
like
a
wheat
beer
their
regular
wheat
isnt
that
flavourful
anyway
so
why
the
hell
would
you
want
to
drink
a
filtered
version
of
it
kind
of
tasted
a
bit
artificial
aswell
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
adequate
carbonation
the
huge
thick
white
creamy
head
actually
stuck
a
full
inch
over
the
lip
of
the
glass
very
nice
to
look
at
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
of
citrus
and
malt
the
maltiness
carried
through
into
the
flavor
with
the
citrusness
slilding
into
the
background
although
not
disappearing
the
finish
was
slightly
watery
however
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
erdinger
offerings
heres
a
different
wheat
beer
there
is
no
hefe
its
clear
without
the
yeast
so
it
lacks
the
stronger
flavor
that
a
hefeweisen
has
clean
smooth
mouthfeel
500ml
the
u
s
importer
is
wine
warehouse
city
of
commerce
ca
clean
tasty
with
the
stubborn
lacey
foam
good
i
can
take
or
leave
the
hefe
in
my
weizen
and
in
this
one
i
dont
miss
the
yeast
thirst
quenching
german
goodness
throughout
i
wish
there
was
a
category
for
value
because
the
only
strike
against
it
is
the
price
per
bottle
good
sweet
taste
better
than
original
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
tastes
great
not
too
sweet
and
with
a
good
amount
of
malts
my
favorite
leinie
overall
a
very
mediocre
beer
you
can
drink
it
but
its
far
from
impressive
in
any
way
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
unless
there
were
no
better
options
one
of
leines
worst
offerings
better
than
an
aal
cheers
delicous
this
beer
is
that
is
all
beautiful
looking
the
taste
does
not
match
up
to
it
fairly
innocuous
and
not
particularly
memorable
it
is
a
passable
beer
if
you
want
to
try
all
of
the
leinies
there
are
better
and
worse
than
this
one
overall
not
bad
for
leinenkugel
this
was
one
of
my
first
beers
and
its
fun
to
go
back
to
i
was
surprised
by
the
appearance
and
smell
but
the
taste
did
not
quite
deliver
in
my
opinion
a
good
summer
beer
nonetheless
one
of
my
summer
favorites
tastes
like
watered
down
lager
each
sip
tastes
worse
than
the
last
great
flavor
i
really
started
enjoying
these
after
a
few
but
all
and
all
this
is
just
a
very
decent
light
bodied
beer
and
not
much
more
its
not
bad
and
its
not
great
but
it
is
very
drinkable
its
better
than
a
lot
of
mainstream
beers
for
sure
a
welcome
subtle
use
of
honey
in
a
beer
and
one
of
leinies
better
brews
purchased
as
part
of
a
variety
12
pack
good
not
great
appearance
was
dark
yellow
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
had
the
sweetness
from
the
honey
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
hops
the
taste
was
a
little
skunky
but
had
a
nice
aftertaste
and
a
good
finish
for
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
refreshing
overall
an
okay
beer
overall
the
worst
leinies
beer
ive
had
and
not
one
i
intend
on
trying
again
soon
how
is
this
their
most
popular
beer
o
exceptionally
uninteresting
its
for
the
sweeter
beer
lovers
the
honey
weiss
is
one
of
leinenkugels
staples
great
beer
overall
this
tasted
exactly
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
with
only
a
trace
of
anything
resembling
honey
o
filtering
a
hefe
seems
to
also
filter
out
any
flavor
as
well
this
seems
like
it
would
be
more
fitting
in
a
summer
variety
pack
its
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
doesnt
really
fit
in
to
a
fall
pack
so
ive
seen
and
heard
about
this
beer
quite
often
i
finally
tried
it
and
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
however
this
was
just
a
deplorable
attempt
by
leinenkugal
the
appearance
is
ok
with
not
much
of
a
head
and
no
real
lacing
but
the
color
may
lead
you
to
believe
the
are
some
layers
of
flavor
in
the
glass
the
scent
is
an
overwhelming
aroma
of
corn
and
every
other
type
of
cheap
filler
you
can
think
call
the
smell
rancid
skunky
or
just
flat
out
cheap
it
wasnt
pleasant
the
taste
is
so
disappointing
i
cant
say
its
too
horrible
as
you
can
drink
it
if
your
nicholas
cage
in
leaving
las
vegas
and
need
a
fix
but
the
corn
and
grassiness
hits
you
right
of
the
bat
and
you
then
quickly
get
some
nasty
honey
flavor
in
my
opinion
there
is
balance
here
and
its
all
bad
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
tap
beer
from
rusty
pipes
in
a
dive
bar
avoid
this
one
its
too
bad
some
of
leinenkugals
stuff
isnt
bad
but
they
crashed
and
burned
on
this
one
d
acceptable
but
not
outstanding
in
anyway
besr
served
cold
and
when
out
of
better
beers
o
well
i
got
a
case
of
this
for
free
from
a
guy
who
works
at
millercoors
ill
probably
give
it
away
too
me
this
is
like
a
budweiser
equivalent
but
i
think
this
tastes
a
tad
bit
better
but
that
doesnt
say
much
i
quite
enjoyed
it
would
suggest
good
to
just
sit
down
and
chill
out
with
not
overwhelming
not
a
complete
wreck
but
its
definitely
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
for
back
to
back
drinking
there
are
plenty
of
others
out
there
that
offer
more
character
and
a
more
enjoyable
experience
i
couldnt
in
good
faith
recommend
this
to
anyone
o
there
is
really
nothing
to
this
beer
very
slight
hops
taste
and
nothing
absolutely
nothing
else
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
like
to
drink
this
beer
once
in
a
while
very
refreshing
o
im
disappointed
in
this
beer
its
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
its
easy
enough
to
drink
and
perhaps
with
the
recommendation
of
trying
this
with
a
lemon
wedge
it
would
be
quite
refreshing
my
biggest
concern
is
that
this
looks
smells
and
tastes
very
similar
to
any
other
american
macro
brew
out
there
other
than
having
a
slightly
sweeter
aftertaste
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
meh
final
thoughts
your
basic
macro
lager
but
with
that
small
town
flair
would
i
drink
it
again
oddly
enough
yes
but
i
never
seek
it
out
this
was
actually
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
the
aromas
of
honey
when
you
open
the
bottle
were
very
noticeable
the
taste
of
this
was
also
very
good
and
will
continue
to
drink
this
beer
when
i
am
able
to
do
so
this
is
very
popular
in
my
area
as
well
i
remember
this
as
one
of
my
very
first
beers
many
moons
ago
lets
see
how
things
go
today
it
pours
a
clear
goldenstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlybuttered
biscuit
light
wheat
and
the
lightest
kiss
of
dried
honey
which
admittedly
might
just
be
there
due
to
advertising
getting
the
better
of
me
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
less
of
a
buttery
quality
and
more
of
a
sweet
one
it
helps
but
it
doesnt
elevate
matters
too
far
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
an
okay
beer
at
best
nothing
close
to
special
but
strangely
drinkable
enough

o
huge
dissapointment
i
expected
something
respectable
i
know
i
have
high
standards
but
even
an
average
beer
drinker
deserves
better
then
this
overall
stay
away
i
might
drink
one
for
free
its
not
what
i
normally
drink
but
when
someone
else
gives
me
a
six
pack
im
game
o
overall
this
beer
couldnt
have
been
any
more
boring
seriously
just
tasted
like
a
light
adjunct
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
o
not
disgusting
but
definitely
one
to
avoid
o
not
bad
i
like
the
honey
but
could
be
better
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
personally
i
like
the
smooth
refreshingness
of
the
honey
wheat
beer
so
i
have
no
problem
putting
these
down
would
i
buy
a
six
pack
for
myself
nah
its
kind
of
dull
but
it
seems
like
it
would
have
mass
appeal
if
it
were
more
widely
available
a
mediocre
wheat
ale
and
hardly
a
kristalweizen
the
honey
flavor
is
not
entirely
forgiving
but
at
least
it
gives
it
character
im
not
a
leinies
fan
but
this
one
was
a
big
disappointment
regrettable
last
beer
of
the
night
o
too
sweet
to
enjoy
not
a
fan
of
the
style
o
well
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
something
to
scream
about
weird
how
i
thought
this
was
a
better
beer
maybe
it
tasted
better
when
i
lived
in
michigan
and
i
was
closer
to
wisconsin
not
sure
o
im
not
overly
familiar
with
this
style
but
i
do
find
this
example
to
be
very
bland
and
unfortunately
reminiscent
of
adjunct
lagers
honey
was
nice
but
not
much
else
was
worth
mentioning

12oz
bottle
out
of
a
summer
sampler
pours
golden
with
excellent
clarity
bubbly
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
muted
but
sweet
with
wheat
and
biscuit
but
thats
about
it
tastes
are
sweet
honey
biscuity
nutty
wheaty
delicately
hopped
mouthfeel
is
thintomedium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
finishes
slightly
dry
overall
i
think
kristalweizen
isnt
the
proper
style
category
for
this
one
as
i
would
tend
to
think
kristalweizen
filtered
german
hefeweizen
where
this
beer
has
no
german
influence
at
all
kristal
american
pale
wheat
ale
whatever
it
may
be
my
values
above
represent
it
as
an
american
wheat
and
its
a
decent
beer
if
you
want
to
think
of
it
that
way
overall
try
it
overall
its
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
much
better
than
bud
light
or
a
big
mainstreem
beer
but
not
far
off
from
them
give
it
a
try
honey
weiss
poured
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
color
with
not
much
head
there
really
wasnt
much
of
a
smell
hints
of
honey
were
present
but
not
much
else
the
taste
had
hints
of
lemon
and
honey
but
had
a
grainy
and
unpleasant
after
taste
light
flavor
and
not
very
enjoyable
overall
stay
away
okay
easy
to
drink
to
the
point
of
being
flavorless
better
than
budmillercoors
but
still
in
that
category
dry
finish
could
probably
drink
it
on
the
hottest
of
july
days
but
only
if
nothing
else
was
available
they
call
this
a
honey
weiss
its
basically
a
deep
pale
golden
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
that
dies
quickly
to
nothing
but
speckled
lacing
aroma
is
minimal
very
muted
sharp
wheat
notes
with
little
to
no
citrus
or
honey
notes
thin
body
easy
to
sip
on
but
the
wheat
notes
give
it
some
actual
nice
breadiness
i
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of
honey
on
the
palate
a
bit
of
hash
grainy
character
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
fruit
maybe
at
this
point
i
will
call
it
citrus
mouthfeel
has
heavy
carbonation
but
a
lighter
body
adding
to
some
unnatural
effervescence
overall
the
beer
is
unlike
any
other
beer
out
there
a
wheat
beer
that
is
crystal
clear
and
tastes
clean
like
basically
nothing
overall
pass
on
this
for
sure
there
arent
really
any
good
flavors
to
it
other
then
the
astringent
alcohol
and
lingering
yeast
honey
sweetness
does
not
come
through
a
poor
showing
m
i
gulped
through
this
pretty
quickly
it
caught
me
off
guard
very
refreshing
and
sweet
leinies
has
a
way
of
sneaking
up
on
you
like
that
poured
out
a
light
honey
color
clear
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fizzes
out
has
poor
retention
and
lacing
smells
like
wheat
and
honey
tastes
like
watered
down
honey
and
wheat
has
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
and
no
hops
presence
what
so
ever
overall
this
is
a
poor
example
of
what
a
kristalweizen
can
be
d
a
light
summer
thirst
solution
not
all
that
different
from
macro
swill
floral
honey
sweetness
and
lemon
hops
dont
really
work
well
together
and
along
with
the
appearance
contribute
to
a
diluted
honeysweetened
shandy
impression
overall
this
beer
is
a
lovely
summertime
brew
i
prefer
this
over
summer
shandy
leinenkugels
summertime
beer
because
this
contains
far
less
fruit
and
is
not
sweetened
nearly
as
much
if
the
price
is
right
and
the
weather
is
warm
try
a
few
of
these
overall
would
not
buy
again
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
wheaty
and
sweet
to
dry
honey
in
the
taste
lemon
citrus
a
wheat
like
bite
and
rounded
out
with
honey
flavors
of
clove
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
wheat
and
clove
like
aftertaste
looks
more
like
a
pils
kind
of
thin
and
domestic
like
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
could
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
better
than
something
really
heavy
like
a
hefeweizen
for
a
day
like
that
you
an
certainly
tell
its
filtered
because
it
comes
out
like
a
lager
in
appearance
and
finish
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
given
the
right
situation
overall
looks
to
me
like
a
lite
lager
in
appearance
the
flavors
in
the
taste
could
be
nice
but
are
thin
and
watery
and
are
quickly
scrubbed
from
the
palate
with
higher
crisp
carb
i
picked
up
some
of
the
alcohol
in
this
session
and
was
left
a
bit
headachy
this
might
taste
pretty
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
warm
summer
day
seems
to
miss
the
style
a
bit
for
me
cant
recommend
this
one
overall
its
a
lawnmower
beer
best
straight
from
the
bottle
when
you
just
want
a
no
think
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
so
mild
in
nature
it
feels
as
though
youre
drinking
a
perrier
at
times
o
easy
to
drink
clean
finish
one
of
the
more
fullerbodied
kristalweizens
but
was
still
a
little
too
watery
overall
a
good
beer
with
common
flaws
so
compared
to
others
one
of
the
better
ones
overall
well
after
not
having
one
of
these
for
7
or
8
years
i
can
pmfortably
say
that
i
will
go
at
least
double
that
before
reaching
for
another
except
in
those
dire
situations
perhaps
at
a
bbq
this
beer
is
not
okay
with
me
i
like
a
sweet
beer
but
this
is
over
the
top
sweet
for
me
i
really
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
bud
lager
with
a
couple
of
tablespoons
of
honey
stirred
in
i
have
to
place
the
beer
on
the
low
i
hope
to
try
a
better
beer
from
old
jacob
soon
so
stayed
tune
the
guys
on
my
hockey
team
really
like
the
leinenkugels
beers
so
they
recently
brought
the
honey
weiss
to
our
recent
game
the
leinies
honey
weiss
was
very
thin
weak
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
there
is
honey
present
and
also
a
toasted
wheat
flavor
but
youre
really
straining
to
get
either
comes
out
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
this
beers
just
about
as
thin
as
any
light
lager
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
corny
taste
to
it
as
well
its
okay
drinking
on
a
hot
day
im
sure
but
dont
look
for
much
dazzlement
on
your
tongue
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
more
flavors
compared
to
other
kristalweizens
kind
of
looks
and
feels
like
a
budweiser
defiantly
has
a
little
more
flavor
and
the
honey
after
taste
is
a
pleasant
surprise
there
is
nothing
special
as
far
as
appearance
really
looks
like
a
miller
lite
or
bud
has
a
decent
head
but
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
if
this
beer
was
a
little
cheaper
i
wouldnt
mind
throwing
these
down
to
get
a
good
buzz
on
or
maybe
grab
9
for
a
game
of
golf
but
besides
that
these
arent
as
crafty
as
they
may
appear
tastes
like
it
smells
faint
weak
wheat
with
a
whisper
of
barelythere
honey
it
also
has
a
watery
thin
body
which
is
refreshing
as
a
summer
thirst
quencher
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
appropriate
crisp
and
clean
finish
i
just
wish
there
was
more
flavor
in
it
i
believe
that
it
is
a
good
lawnmower
beer
at
least
it
is
better
than
a
bmc
but
really
mostly
only
by
the
virtue
of
not
having
any
strange
offflavors
pretty
average
overall
actually
just
below
it
i
did
have
another
one
later
in
the
week
and
it
tasted
a
bit
better
but
i
think
my
ratings
will
stick
overall
a
very
light
but
fairly
tasty
brew
best
had
in
the
summer
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
thick
head
which
stays
around
the
aroma
is
of
grains
and
sweet
malt
there
is
not
a
lot
going
the
aroma
is
faint
and
hard
to
get
the
taste
is
much
the
same
grainy
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
honey
the
taste
seems
closer
to
an
adjunct
than
a
kristal
the
taste
is
muted
and
hard
to
identify
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
crisp
overall
it
is
okay
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
one
again
the
taste
and
aroma
just
werent
there
o
its
a
decent
intro
beer
but
its
not
one
that
i
regularly
pursue
the
honey
flavor
is
kinda
nice
but
it
doesnt
go
anywhere
a
beer
stuck
in
first
gear
i
would
say
this
beer
is
not
really
a
good
beer
the
only
thing
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
is
possibly
a
transition
beer
people
just
getting
off
mass
market
beers
may
be
interested
in
this
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
anyone
else
and
i
wont
be
drinking
this
beer
again
o
one
and
done
stop
those
ads
making
this
sound
like
a
good
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
halfinch
head
and
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
honey
and
flowers
its
flavor
has
lemon
vanilla
and
honey
notes
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
leinenkugels
honey
wheat
is
a
good
beer
very
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
golden
coloralmost
anemically
sobut
had
a
nice
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
an
admixture
of
lightly
toasted
malt
and
honey
the
flavor
profile
is
similar
to
the
nose
the
beer
goes
down
easy
but
the
sweetness
from
the
honey
becomes
a
bit
much
more
my
tastes
the
beer
is
a
little
light
through
the
center
and
finishes
with
not
more
than
a
whimper
o
this
is
okay
if
youre
at
a
summer
get
together
and
this
one
is
on
the
top
layer
of
ice
in
the
cooler
well
i
say
dig
to
the
bottom
and
hope
for
the
best
a
big
shout
out
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
wheat
and
grains
a
touch
of
honey
taste
is
also
big
on
the
wheat
some
honey
is
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
brew
not
a
good
beer
at
all
in
my
opinion
pass
o
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
very
solid
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
more
than
makes
up
in
being
a
straightforward
easy
to
drink
beer
which
sometimes
is
all
you
ned
all
in
all
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
it
just
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
other
than
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
overall
this
beer
doesnt
promise
much
but
it
overdelivers
not
an
everyday
thing
i
dont
think
but
certainly
one
of
the
better
options
out
of
the
leinies
variety
pack
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
very
small
white
fizzy
head
on
it
the
body
is
a
nice
golden
color
body
the
smell
is
sweet
of
honey
and
some
wheat
i
dont
taste
any
wheat
but
i
get
a
sweet
start
and
a
little
hop
finish
to
it
very
crisp
though
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
summer
time
beer
this
stuff
is
alright
less
sweet
than
expected
which
is
good
it
is
light
and
refreshing
but
lacks
in
complexity
overall
its
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
well
with
most
foods
on
the
other
hand
its
a
bit
boring
and
uninspiring
notes
this
lightbodied
beer
is
another
example
of
a
product
that
is
meant
to
be
craft
but
geared
towards
the
mainstream
crowd
drinkable
and
not
horrible
but
not
a
beer
for
my
liking
i
cringe
to
see
this
grouped
in
with
the
weihenstephaner
kristallweizen
thats
a
great
beer
this
aint
honey
weiss
doesnt
recall
the
style
much
very
thin
weak
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
yeah
theres
honey
yeah
theres
kind
of
a
cereal
toasted
wheat
flavor
but
youre
really
straining
to
get
either
comes
out
mostly
but
only
minimally
in
the
aftertaste
this
beers
just
about
as
thin
as
any
light
lager
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
corny
taste
to
it
as
well
its
okay

on
your
tongue
the
honey
weiss
pours
out
at
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
in
the
beginning
but
trails
off
by
mid
glass
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
mix
of
grains
and
malts
the
flavor
of
the
beer
doesnt
scream
honey
like
i
would
have
liked
it
too
the
taste
is
clean
and
fairly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
though
the
body
of
this
brew
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
overall
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
brew
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
away
if
it
were
offered
to
me
drinkability
this
beers
not
hard
to
drink
as
it
is
so
light
but
its
just
lacking
enough
enjoyability
for
it
to
be
a
good
go
to
choice
flavor
profile
is
just
to
thin
and
simplistic
just
not
enough
going
on
here
and
i
think
probably
the
weakest
of
there
line
in
my
opinion
its
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
certainly
nothing
special
just
cracked
one
of
these
on
a
great
spring
day
cant
get
much
better
for
the
bargain
sure
theres
better
beers
but
this
one
hits
great
price
point
and
is
a
quality
brew
great
notes
of
honey
go
figure
just
enough
sweetness
in
it
to
get
you
through
a
warm
springsummer
day
id
take
this
over
the
shandy
any
day
the
shandy
is
too
sweet
and
fills
you
up
so
fast
this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
do
not
give
a
schlitz
for
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
overall
drinkability
seriously
not
impressed
by
this
beer
not
one
of
leinenkugels
best
i
definitely
do
not
recommend
this
beer
i
can
see
some
redeeming
qualities
for
bmc
fans
but
not
for
anyone
with
any
palate
development
whatsoever
o
pales
in
comparison
to
the
sunset
wheat
if
i
wasnt
a
cheap
ass
in
need
of
a
buzz
i
wouldve
probably
set
it
aside
ive
drank
a
lot
of
this
one
in
my
day
my
favorite
from
leines
they
seem
to
have
become
more
interested
in
making
a
buck
vs
complex
beers
with
a
lot
of
their
recent
offerings
honey
weiss
is
one
they
have
had
in
their
rotation
for
many
years
so
making
it
efficiently
was
probably
less
of
a
concern
before
being
bought
by
miller
perhaps
this
is
why
this
beer
has
more
complexity
albeit
not
much
vs
their
new
offerings
nothing
special
nor
offensive
i
doubt
many
bas
will
seek
this
out
its
better
than
having
macros
so
if
youre
at
a
bar
in
the
upper
midwest
and
this
is
available
id
say
to
go
for
it
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
quickly
diminishing
head
has
a
decent
scent
of
wheat
to
it
taste
it
rather
simple
as
it
is
basically
a
lighter
flavored
wheat
beer
im
really
searching
for
the
honey
taste
in
it
and
can
not
find
it
definetly
a
summer
beer
but
essentially
is
just
a
glorified
miller
lite
taste
wise
certainly
not
unique
by
any
means
overall
its
very
drinkable
but
would
have
liked
to
had
a
stronger
honey
flavor
i
would
drink
it
again
but
only
in
a
variety
pack
i
wouldnt
buy
a
pack
of
just
this
beer
overall
not
terrible
but
not
good
either
grab
the
fishing
pole
and
a
cooler
of
these
and
you
will
have
a
great
day
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
but
i
always
relate
a
leinies
to
an
outdoor
activity
whats
wrong
with
that
i
guess
it
is
not
too
bad
honey
and
beer
go
together
like
pb
j
a
great
combination
this
beer
is
a
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
wheat
beer
not
to
exciting
to
look
at
or
smell
but
it
taste
pretty
damn
good
great
session
beer
my
best
friend
from
minnesota
likes
to
put
a
lemon
with
it
ending
notes
overall
not
too
impressive
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
anytime
soon
average
summer
beer
at
best
if
youve
never
had
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
its
definately
worth
a
try
i
recommend
leinenkugels
spring
variety
pack
which
includes
honey
weiss
the
cpj
not
something
id
search
out
leinenkugel
needs
to
cut
the
lemon
flavor
and
add
some
more
malt
the
crispness
of
the
beer
does
not
seem
to
come
from
the
wheat
so
much
i
think
lemon
juice
was
added
to
give
it
the
crisp
zing
a
really
bad
call
as
it
throws
off
the
flavor
worst
weizen
ive
ever
had
now
heres
a
brew
that
makes
me
drool
a
little
and
say
mmm
beer
there
is
nothing
special
at
all
about
this
beer
in
fact
the
honey
taste
is
either
hidden
very
well
or
nonexsistant
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
but
makes
this
beer
rather
boring
this
one
is
best
enjoyed
as
a
12
pack
honey
weiss
goes
down
smooth
and
tastes
pretty
good
from
notes
on
tap
pours
golden
with
minimal
head
which
quickly
diminishes
initially
smells
like
burning
plastic
but
warms
up
to
a
slightly
sweeter
aroma
with
floral
overtones
easy
to
drink
no
flavor
to
speak
of
other
than
a
slightly
sour
finish
and
a
fake
sweetenerlike
aftertaste
not
remarkable
not
out
of
the
ordinary
and
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
go
after
specifically
ill
not
be
having
another
overall
nothing
outstanding
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
of
mowing
grass
itd
be
great
was
expecting
a
little
more
honey
taste
not
sure
how
that
would
affect
the
beer
overall
but
an
interesting
thought
in
the
end
i
would
recommend
this
brew
for
someone
looking
for
an
easy
to
drink
weizen
golden
straw
color
beer
that
isnt
quite
as
pale
as
most
american
lagers
it
has
a
bit
more
of
a
golden
hue
to
it
this
beer
keeps
its
carbonation
launching
and
will
keep
decent
head
retention
if
left
alone
i
smell
herbal
notes
and
honey
with
just
some
malt
this
beer
tastes
of
the
herbal
honey
notes
along
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
and
a
sweet
malt
backbone
this
is
a
bit
lighter
than
the
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
so
its
a
very
nice
thirst
quencher
and
drinks
very
easily
this
is
the
first
and
only
kellerweis
i
have
tried
but
it
is
a
pleasant
one
the
wheat
is
also
a
noticeable
difference
from
the
barley
cant
believe
this
stuff
is
going
for
7
a
6er
now
not
worth
it
at
even
half
that
price
drinkability
drinkable
brew
but
not
complex
at
all
in
the
taste
still
not
badtasting
either
had
one
yesterday
in
the
bottle
and
tasted
completely
different
pretty
good
beer
admittedly
my
tastes
are
a
bit
on
the
week
side
but
i
really
like
this
beer
d
kind
of
boring
one
dimensional
and
body
was
way
to
light
for
me
to
consider
a
second
purchase
still
it
was
cool
to
try
and
overall
a
tasty
beverage
d
while
it
is
nothing
special
as
far
as
taste
i
could
go
through
a
six
pack
easily
it
would
be
a
remarkable
hot
weather
beer
on
a
cold
night
though
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
d
drinkable
is
one
positive
attribute
of
this
beer
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
where
refreshment
is
as
important
as
taste
taste
really
pleasant
taste
it
has
a
little
bit
of
a
bread
like
taste
mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
there
is
very
little
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
the
sweet
flavor
is
not
overpowering
d
excellent
drinkability
a
good
middle
ground
for
those
of
us
who
like
good
flavors
and
those
who
drink
the
big
3
i
cant
say
i
order
or
buy
this
one
a
lot
but
i
always
enjoy
it
when
i
do
have
one
verdict
looks
very
good
tastes
above
average
there
isnt
much
to
distinguish
this
beer
above
the
crowd
of
honey
and
wheat
brews
you
shouldnt
be
disappointed
but
then
again
you
shouldnt
be
astounded
either
not
a
bad
leinenkugel
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
running
into
this
one
again
b
3
65
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
leinies
good
summer
beer
and
many
nonbeer
lovers
may
enjoy
it
very
sessionable
great
post
grasscutting
beer
not
very
drinkable
but
would
do
in
a
pinch
d
as
far
as
drinkability
this
is
a
quaffing
beer
when
youre
looking
to
hydrate
while
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
too
rough
to
even
be
served
in
good
glassware
this
is
one
you
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
go
for
those
beers
before
you
pick
this
one
up
very
crisp
and
fresh
with
a
lightness
and
drinkability
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
maybe
after
some
yard
work
very
smooth
with
a
slight
mild
honey
comb
finish
i
find
this
beer
dangerous
cause
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
in
one
sitting
with
ease
drinkability
good
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
not
that
i
would
choose
to
or
want
to
this
beer
pours
into
a
nice
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
excellent
lacing
retention
and
carbonation
i
can
smell
a
little
wheat
in
this
beer
but
not
much
else
and
when
tasting
this
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
that
clings
to
your
tongue
and
cheeks
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
do
taste
some
wheat
followed
by
a
malty
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
honey
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
beer
for
someone
that
wants
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
very
good
mouth
feel
that
isnt
too
strong
on
the
taste
buds
to
me
this
is
another
leinie
that
is
fine
in
a
variety
pack
but
just
like
creamy
dark
i
would
not
get
it
in
a
six
pack
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
spend
a
few
more
and
you
can
drink
the
real
thing
imported
from
germany
and
the
difference
is
readily
apparent
if
you
simply
want
a
clear
yellow
easy
to
drink
beer
with
the
usual
lager
flavors
pick
up
some
miller
high
life
for
much
less
and
you
wont
notice
much
difference
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
moderate
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
and
no
real
lacing
the
nose
is
some
fairlystrong
honey
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
grain
the
taste
is
sugar
honey
and
light
grassy
grain
pretty
cloying
body
that
makes
it
seem
a
lot
heavier
than
it
really
is
not
terrible
but
not
something
i
want
much
of
final
notes
this
beer
was
allaround
bad
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
yet
another
letdown
by
leinenkugels
brewery
sad
day
not
a
favorite
of
mine
bought
it
in
a
winter
variety
12
pack
following
the
crack
glug
i
was
going
for
maximum
head
so
i
utilized
my
soontobefamous
inverted
pour
resulting
in
a
fingerandahalf
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
color
was
like
liquid
sunshine
in
a
glass
beautiful
deep
golden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
king
midas
would
have
been
envious
of
the
gold
nose
was
very
malty
sweet
as
a
previous
reviewer
put
it
very
succinctly
it
smelled
like
being
on
a
tour
of
the
brewery
dig
that
i
like
brewery
tours
btw
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
wheat
beer
taste
initially
followed
by
a
lingering
honey
taste
on
the
finish
man
this
was
very
tasty
and
a
definite
candidate
for
the
imaginary
cooler
that
i
am
continually
filling
for
a
beach
outing
much
better
than
their
summer
shandy
which
just
begs
to
be
blended
with
furthermores
knot
stock
to
become
a
lemon
pepper
beer
suddenly
i
want
to
try
the
berry
weiss
that
much
more
overall
im
not
impressed
with
this
beer
while
mildly
drinkable
in
that
its
not
harsh
to
drink
its
not
as
pleasant
to
drink
as
better
beer
try
something
else
even
something
else
from
leinenkugels
they
have
better
stuff
from
that
brewery
d
i
always
rate
the
drinkability
high
for
beers
with
low
alcohol
and
light
flavor
o
solid
summer
beer
and
good
stepping
stone
to
more
flavorful
selections
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
my
coors
banquet
tasting
glass
some
foamy
white
head
that
popped
up
and
went
down
quickly
a
clear
golden
colour
not
the
weisse
cloud
that
i
am
accustomed
to
smells
yeast
and
malts
with
some
fruit
overtonesnoticed
the
honey
faintly
near
the
end
tastes
as
expected
light
honey
light
fruits
and
malts
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
fine
i
got
three
in
the
box
so
i
guess
ill
drink
three
i
like
this
better
than
some
of
the
other
varieties
in
the
leiney
sampler
d
a
decent
summer
beer
if
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
found
not
bad
but
not
my
thing
boring
overall
this
beer
is
as
bland
as
bud
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
whatever
amount
of
times
that
the
only
thing
good
coming
out
of
leinenkugel
is
the
sunset
wheat
drinkability
fairly
mild
taste
with
a
light
body
makes
this
easy
to
drink
in
the
summer
heat
but
i
wont
be
craving
it
anytime
soon
maybe
im
just
spoiled
drinkability
a
simple
and
easytodrink
wheat
beer
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
but
still
refreshing
and
pleasant
to
have
on
a
hot
day
d
great
lawnmower
beer
and
goes
well
with
the
polish
sausage
and
grilled
onions
at
the
cell
overall
not
bad
at
all
really
quite
nicely
done
and
something
i
would
have
no
issue
with
again
though
i
doubt
i
would
pay
for
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
this
is
fairly
drinkable
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
the
taste
isnt
really
something
that
makes
you
want
to
go
back
for
more
the
feel
of
this
beer
was
pretty
light
and
felt
like
there
wasnt
a
lot
there
it
did
go
down
real
easy
and
was
pretty
drinkable
so
in
the
end
it
was
a
good
summer
beer
but
one
that
i
will
not
have
too
often
very
good
looking
amber
beer
slight
head
to
it
very
low
carbonation
the
smell
of
it
was
very
malty
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
very
bitter
which
is
why
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
to
me
it
wasnt
very
drinkable
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
any
time
soon
pretty
good
for
this
style
of
beer
the
flavors
are
there
but
light
and
watered
down
its
that
weird
lemonhoney
cut
with
a
light
beer
the
aftertaste
is
an
imitation
lemony
flavor
d
for
the
style
this
is
not
bad
at
all
there
is
actually
some
nuance
in
the
flavour
a
slight
hint
of
honey
but
dont
expect
anything
more
than
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
az
day
and
not
be
upset
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
which
is
a
lot
better
than
many
macros
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
expected
more
of
a
honey
profile
in
the
beer
theres
a
bit
of
honey
in
the
nose
but
its
barely
perceptible
in
the
beer
itself
overall
the
beer
is
good
but
the
wife
and
i
just
didnt
pick
up
much
of
its
namesake
in
the
profile
its
very
drinkable
but
id
rather
have
a
sunset
wheat
if
i
had
a
choice
md
on
the
thin
side
and
very
easy
drinking
a
good
summer
beer
d
for
what
it
is
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
underutilized
and
underappreciated
this
beer
reminds
me
of
summer
in
wisconsin
not
great
owned
by
miller
but
good
enough
had
it
most
recently
on
tap
at
the
la
crosse
loggers
game
sunday
not
much
head
to
speak
of
retention
was
pretty
weak
golden
in
color
translucent
smell
of
honey
would
have
been
better
with
a
lemon
in
at
as
its
sometimes
served
taste
of
honey
and
light
citrus
solid
lawnmower
beer
but
its
not
going
to
change
any
lives
interested
to
try
it
half
and
half
with
the
berry
weis
ive
heard
its
better
than
either
alone
overall
might
be
better
if
served
very
cold
on
a
hot
day
in
a
frosted
beer
mug
which
is
about
the
only
way
i
can
enjoy
an
american
adjunct
lager
d
there
is
not
enough
flavor
in
this
beer
an
will
quickly
become
a
session
beer
in
the
hot
sun
in
my
book
drinkability
ugh
i
wouldnt
have
another
dcould
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
was
in
the
mood
but
not
a
great
beer
d
pretty
good
again
there
is
a
certain
fullness
to
this
beer
but
it
isnt
heavy
by
any
means
i
think
it
is
just
the
carbonation
it
is
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
and
one
of
the
better
beers
in
this
aspect
in
my
opinion
not
a
great
beer
but
might
be
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
dlighter
body
and
good
flavor
combination
that
are
not
to
overpowering
make
this
beer
good
to
drink
on
thous
warm
springsummer
days
drinkability
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
this
actually
is
not
all
that
bad
a
beer
it
tastes
like
a
pale
wheat
with
honeynot
overly
fruited
a
different
take
on
the
style
that
i
could
session
d
easy
to
drink
maybe
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
thought
it
was
kind
of
boring
the
honey
weiss
is
of
course
a
honey
wheat
beer
its
got
a
little
bit
more
of
a
bitter
flavor
than
can
compare
to
michelobs
honey
lager
but
of
course
were
talking
ales
vs
lagers
here
its
a
good
flavor
and
readily
available
around
where
i
live
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
category
but
leinies
strikes
a
good
note
with
this
one
at
least
in
my
book
notes
they
should
call
this
beer
lemon
weiss
instead
of
honey
weiss
because
that
is
the
dominant
characteristic
i
taste
in
this
beer
in
fact
this
beer
is
so
lemony
that
it
encroaches
on
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
territory
if
this
was
the
summer
shandy
id
be
understanding
of
the
lemon
taste
but
since
its
not
it
comes
off
as
a
rather
generic
pale
wheat
beer
with
too
much
lemon
honey
weiss
is
a
fairly
average
beer
it
smells
sweet
i
almost
thought
it
taste
a
bit
lemony
other
than
that
there
wasnt
a
great
deal
of
flavor
it
didnt
have
an
overly
appealing
look
just
a
light
yellow
color
with
little
to
no
head
it
wasnt
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
there
wasnt
much
that
set
it
apart
from
others
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
wheaty
very
clear
for
a
wheat
beer
but
its
really
quite
easy
to
drink
and
really
light
its
got
a
bit
of
that
bmc
twang
but
better
than
most
macro
lagers
this
one
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
away
rather
moderately
fast
it
has
a
slight
sweet
aroma
honey
is
definitely
there
palette
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
character
it
has
a
smooth
finish
and
no
harsh
aftertaste
it
is
decent
but
not
a
regular
bottle
into
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
moderate
frothy
head
aroma
contained
notes
of
citrus
and
malt
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
honey
drink
was
very
crisp
but
the
honey
sweetness
was
not
present
as
advertised
i
think
this
may
have
looked
at
honey
once
but
that
was
about
it
that
aside
it
was
a
very
refreshing
drink
with
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
not
recommended
for
those
looking
for
the
sweetness
honey
implied
but
a
very
good
summer
standby
di
could
probably
do
two
of
these
of
an
extremely
warm
summers
day
but
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
waste
my
money
cheers
can
recommend
this
for
the
most
part
enjoyed
it
a
little
more
than
the
classic
amber
leinenkugel
bottle
poured
a
clean
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
bubbly
white
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
honey
and
light
wheat
malt
is
mostly
bland
taste
is
dominated
by
light
sweet
honey
malt
with
not
much
wheat
being
noticeable
body
is
kind
of
light
with
good
carbonation
very
bland
and
ordinary
and
almost
taste
like
a
macro
final
thoughts
decent
summer
beer
that
would
quench
your
thirst
very
well
and
has
good
drinkability
some
light
honey
and
sweetness
that
finishes
dry
and
crisp
its
very
much
like
a
mead
crossed
with
very
light
wheat
beer
crossed
with
sauvignon
blanc
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
people
that
have
taste
buds
and
know
what
beer
actually
tastes
like
but
in
a
choice
between
this
and
water
to
rehydrate
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
go
with
this
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
film
of
lace
the
aroma
is
malty
and
a
bit
on
the
lagerish
side
im
not
sure
if
its
the
honey
thats
responsible
the
taste
is
sweet
with
quite
a
bit
of
malt
the
crisp
mouthfeel
seems
right
for
an
american
wheat
not
a
terrible
drink
but
not
one
that
ill
look
for
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
and
not
too
filling
since
its
on
the
lighter
side
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
a
lot
of
other
wheat
beers
or
lighter
beers
that
i
would
choose
before
this
one
drinkability
nothing
special
but
not
bad
and
it
certainly
is
refreshing
it
has
no
distint
aroma
or
taste
for
that
matter
its
light
summer
beer
a
total
sessional
that
i
enjoyed
more
than
i
would
a
miller
lite
over
nothing
special
but
it
is
what
it
is
drinkable
not
in
my
mind
the
flavor
is
pungently
underwhelming
and
sour
to
boot
combine
to
that
the
lack
of
decent
other
qualities
and
this
becomes
one
wasteful
soul
short
of
a
drain
pour
dr
it
will
be
a
struggle
but
ill
finish
it
golden
color
with
a
foamy
head
and
mild
presence
of
prickle
served
with
a
wedge
of
lemon
which
i
assume
to
be
customary
though
i
dont
care
for
it
i
have
had
it
in
the
metrodome
without
the
lemon
but
i
wasnt
reviewing
then
the
nose
is
refreshing
and
light
almost
cool
with
a
definite
floral
presence
about
it
the
attack
is
fresh
and
cool
on
a
warm
afternoon
the
flavor
is
pretty
smooth
and
reasonably
pleasant
but
not
to
die
for
it
is
somewhat
undescript
in
both
a
good
way
and
a
bad
way
its
a
light
beer
in
the
sense
that
i
would
say
it
has
broad
appeal
there
are
hints
of
honey
and
lemon
in
the
flavor
the
finish
resonates
with
characteristics
that
i
would
associate
with
a
macrobrew
i
cant
complain
about
it
it
was
available
at
applebees
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
just
too
light
in
flavor
for
my
taste
poured
a
piss
yellow
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
smelled
of
artificial
honey
rice
corn
steamed
veggies
taste
of
lemon
and
grainy
thin
body
this
was
my
first
drain
pour
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
after
drinking
the
quality
of
beers
that
i
have
been
drinking
there
was
no
way
i
was
going
to
was
my
taste
buds
on
this
crap
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
the
head
has
poor
retention
smell
is
of
wheat
and
some
sweetness
cant
say
the
sweetness
is
from
honey
though
the
taste
is
the
same
but
i
dont
taste
honey
kind
of
a
bland
beer
overall
clean
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
light
bodied
not
offensive
also
not
special
decent
drinkability
nothing
special
kind
of
eh
nikki
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
its
drinkable
d
as
one
of
their
flagship
beers
its
a
solid
brew
for
a
lighter
beer
decent
flavor
and
aroma
coupled
with
a
fantastic
drinkability
lends
this
beer
well
to
the
session
brew
category
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
white
head
faint
citrus
smells
i
have
to
really
stretch
to
get
the
honey
i
was
very
disappointed
in
the
taste
not
much
going
on
here
very
watery
i
guess
you
could
sit
and
drink
this
all
day
because
there
is
no
offensive
taste
really
no
taste
at
all
for
that
matter
ill
stick
with
the
shandy
it
is
def
a
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
a
good
change
of
pace
from
your
typical
american
beer
and
when
you
need
a
break
from
the
great
german
variety
that
i
get
to
enjoy
however
i
enjoy
some
of
the
other
leinenkugel
altogether
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
offers
not
too
many
complexities
to
ponder
its
a
good
trade
over
from
the
bmc
scene
d
easy
to
drink
because
of
how
light
it
is
not
horrible
but
not
that
good
either
d
very
easy
drinker
really
theres
just
not
that
much
going
on
with
this
beer
its
weak
very
simple
and
nonoffensive
only
slightly
better
than
the
typical
american
adjunct
lager
this
beer
poured
thin
with
pretty
much
no
head
the
color
is
a
pale
yellow
and
the
beer
seemed
very
carbonated
with
tons
of
bubbles
sticking
to
the
glass
the
first
smell
was
some
what
disturbing
smelled
of
rotten
wheat
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
cheap
light
beer
there
was
a
little
bit
of
hoppiness
in
as
it
hit
the
tongue
which
was
the
highlight
but
other
than
that
very
light
and
watery
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
enjoyable
a
good
wheat
beer
no
bitterness
makes
it
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
d
easy
going
beer
without
alot
of
overpowering
taste
nothing
wow
about
it
but
nothing
particularly
bad
average
all
around
d
a
decent
wheat
beer
but
no
unique
characteristics
to
make
it
a
stand
out
pretty
uninteresting
beer
easy
to
drink
and
probably
refreshing
if
it
were
warmer
out
however
better
for
getting
hammered
than
savoring
leinenkugels
also
has
a
wide
variety
of
other
beers
in
their
lineup
and
most
of
them
are
good
as
well
in
my
opinion
leinenkugels
has
the
best
batch
of
variety
beers
sam
adams
being
a
close
second
to
the
people
in
leinie
country
i
say
thank
you
and
keep
on
brewing
to
the
people
who
have
never
tried
a
leinies
i
say
what
are
you
waiting
for
drink
up
i
am
somewhat
unfamiliar
with
its
supposed
style
and
not
a
genuine
fan
of
the
wheat
beers
but
none
the
less
i
have
had
some
this
beer
was
very
very
pale
with
an
almost
macro
taste
i
did
pick
up
on
faint
scents
and
tastes
of
honey
but
not
nearly
at
the
levels
that
one
would
anticipate
appearance
scores
this
beer
a
few
points
simply
because
the
head
retention
is
good
but
thats
it
the
worst
leinenkugel
i
have
had
yet
worst
part
is
i
cant
use
the
bottles
for
homebrew
because
they
are
twists
errgh
the
honey
wheat
taste
definitely
comes
through
but
the
big
drawback
for
me
was
that
it
left
a
pasty
aftertaste
worth
a
shot
but
not
a
big
fan
decent
atmosphere
a
nice
distinctive
nose
flavor
is
decent
but
the
honey
as
the
name
suggests
doesnt
really
come
out
in
the
flavor
feel
is
okay
when
its
all
said
and
done
a
solid
quaff
the
4
90
abv
can
hardly
be
felt
here
and
this
has
session
beer
written
all
over
it
sure
i
like
my
beers
complex
but
once
in
a
while
its
good
to
veg
out
and
have
something
without
thinking
about
it
now
where
did
summer
go
like
many
of
leinenkugels
flavors
this
is
a
great
stepping
stone
brew
from
here
i
am
excited
to
try
some
of
the
mead
beers
that
are
out
there
aroma
was
very
faint
there
wasnt
much
honey
it
was
much
drier
than
i
expected
not
much
body
either
carbonation
isnt
as
rough
as
some
macros
so
i
guess
thats
a
plus
so
if
you
like
the
high
attenuated
dry
macro
type
this
is
an
easy
drinker
i
just
hoped
for
more
flavor
and
body
a
little
fizzy
but
not
a
bad
light
refreshing
beer
not
too
far
from
expectation
but
not
exactly
on
target
either
the
honey
is
there
but
more
difficult
to
detect
than
i
would
have
liked
light
flavors
of
wheat
and
a
little
sweetness
very
light
head
of
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
its
a
little
more
watery
than
i
would
have
liked
but
otherwise
okay
i
know
theres
a
difference
between
pale
ale
and
india
pale
ale
but
for
regular
pale
ale
id
rather
have
a
sierra
nevada
also
i
couldnt
detect
the
honey
should
i
have
another
it
was
worth
a
try
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
good
thing
i
got
a
deal
on
the
stuff
this
beer
poured
an
orangish
yellow
with
a
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
faint
but
sweet
with
a
little
honey
and
grain
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
corntasting
sweetness
that
gives
way
to
honey
reminds
me
of
a
standard
american
lager
with
some
honey
in
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
some
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
really
not
what
i
expected
from
the
label
d
this
beer
is
simple
and
a
bit
of
a
let
down
if
that
is
your
thing
this
the
beer
for
you
personally
if
i
want
a
macro
ill
buy
a
12
pack
of
high
life
for
the
price
of
this
six
pack
flavors
look
and
smells
are
all
basic
and
kind
of
crappy
this
doesnt
stand
up
the
the
style
at
all
imo
not
a
fan
but
hey
at
least
it
doesnt
have
the
crazy
fruity
pebbles
flavor
the
berry
weiss
and
sunset
wheat
had
pours
a
pale
yellow
slight
hazy
and
no
head
someone
had
thrown
a
piece
of
lemon
in
it
i
cannot
get
my
head
around
why
i
tried
to
pull
it
out
straight
away
but
the
beer
tasted
of
lemon
afterwards
anyway
no
real
aroma
slight
sweet
and
corn
honey
not
in
my
flavour
almost
no
flavour
but
the
lemon
and
a
bit
of
wheat
notes
rather
watery
drinkability
taste
is
fairly
unoffensive
and
the
mouthfeel
is
average
so
this
is
good
for
this
i
wouldnt
have
a
huge
problem
with
a
couple
of
these
its
just
that
i
can
get
much
better
beers
of
the
same
style
nothing
special
pours
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
head
although
no
lacing
and
no
floaties
taste
and
aroma
were
like
lemon
dusting
spray
couldnt
finish
it
but
had
to
pour
it
out
it
was
pretty
horrible
i
went
down
fine
but
thats
second
to
the
taste
i
couldnt
even
get
the
honey
flavor
from
it
overall
i
would
only
recommend
this
because
it
has
decent
flavor
and
feels
like
you
could
drink
an
endless
amount
i
know
leines
makes
some
decent
brews
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
d
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
while
camping
or
in
an
other
situation
where
im
roughing
it
easy
to
drink
and
reminds
me
of
summer
dthis
would
be
an
ok
session
beer
but
its
not
a
spectacular
brew
the
flavor
is
rather
plain
the
characteristics
are
unremarkable
regardless
of
this
ill
likely
continue
to
drink
it
as
leines
honey
weiss
is
a
staple
throughout
minnesota
and
the
midwest
not
bad
but
not
good
ontap
at
the
vikes
games
for
the
same
price
seven
bucks
as
lesser
macro
options
i
mean
as
macros
and
adjucncts
go
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
but
as
an
american
wheat
it
kind
of
sucks
the
aroma
has
typical
dmscooked
corn
like
other
leinenkugel
brews
the
flavor
does
start
out
with
a
mix
of
triscutwheat
taste
and
a
drop
of
honey
flavoring
but
its
followed
by
adjunct
offflavors
to
reiterate
for
cheap
beer
its
not
bad
for
craft
beer
it
sucks
dont
drink
and
review
carbonation
affects
the
mouthfeel
as
always
and
the
drinkability
is
hampered
not
a
good
track
record
for
leinenkugels
thus
far
from
me
after
this
winter
pack
ill
probably
never
try
another
brew
from
them
sort
of
a
deep
straw
colorwith
a
faint
yeast
aromamaby
straw
a
light
crisp
flavor
but
lacking
in
any
thing
that
really
stands
outvery
little
in
the
way
of
hops
or
malt
in
the
aroma
or
flavorand
where
is
the
honey
promised
on
the
labelvery
averagedrinkable
but
very
average
d
decently
drinkable
best
consumed
ice
cold
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
a
sidenote
i
should
mention
that
a
guide
during
my
tour
of
the
leinies
brewery
said
there
are
only
two
drops
of
honey
in
each
bottle
i
can
tell
good
to
drink
every
now
and
then
but
not
something
i
would
do
constantly
poured
into
a
snow
white
head
that
disappated
very
fast
very
light
yellow
in
color
and
brew
was
very
clear
i
dont
know
if
ive
seen
a
more
clearer
beer
or
not
virtually
no
lacing
to
speak
of
just
a
couple
of
white
blothes
here
and
there
very
light
smelling
maybe
a
little
sweet
honey
tasted
very
light
also
had
a
little
taste
of
honey
and
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
but
not
much
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
it
was
almost
like
it
had
little
or
no
carbonation
very
thin
and
watery
i
dont
think
ill
buy
these
again
really
had
no
flavor
to
speak
of
there
was
nothing
to
draw
you
back
to
the
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
weak
little
white
head
that
fizzes
away
to
nothingness
no
lacing
grainy
faint
aroma
with
a
touch
of
tartness
pretty
weak
no
real
detectable
wheat
influence
flavor
is
sort
of
like
a
really
wimpy
berliner
weisse
a
little
tart
and
a
little
sweet
and
grainy
quite
watery
thin
body
borefest
taste
tastes
like
a
macro
with
some
honey
overall
this
is
a
very
disappointing
beer
d
easy
to
drink
for
beginners
my
girlfriend
enjoyed
this
one
not
as
high
on
my
scale
but
a
good
wheat
out
of
bottle
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
golden
color
with
a
little
visible
carbonation
the
head
retained
itself
well
and
left
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
odd
slightly
spicy
and
slightly
weizenlike
but
it
was
notably
soft
the
flavors
were
washed
out
too
and
slightly
skunky
some
fruity
malt
and
generic
grains
trying
to
cover
the
unpleasantness
up
a
very
weird
effort
the
honey
never
came
through
the
body
was
light
and
the
carbonation
ok
but
i
would
not
buy
another
d
while
a
poor
example
of
what
a
honey
weiss
should
taste
like
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
party
or
something
instead
of
a
whatever
light
d
high
a
good
session
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
definatly
drinkable
but
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
boring
beer
couldnt
find
anything
totally
offensive
about
it
but
i
would
never
return
to
it
even
if
pressed
id
probably
opt
for
a
water
or
soda
and
that
is
absolutely
not
snobbery
its
just
a
matter
of
only
wanting
the
best
beer
possible
whenever
possible
and
not
supporting
a
belowaverage
product
leinenkugels
will
never
be
mistaken
for
bells
or
stone
but
theyve
surely
done
better
than
this
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
d
definitely
drinkable
unlike
some
the
mild
sweetness
would
make
me
tire
of
the
taste
that
said
i
still
think
it
could
be
a
little
sweeter
mouthfeel
is
like
watereddown
tea
little
taste
and
nothing
in
the
finish
at
4
9
abv
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
the
question
would
be
why
im
unimpressed
i
drink
this
stuff
if
it
is
the
right
price
but
it
would
not
be
my
first
pick
in
honey
wheat
beer
it
does
have
less
overwhelming
honey
notes
which
i
do
like
that
part
it
is
highly
drinkable
when
its
on
sale
fro
4
a
sixer
in
the
fall
it
is
a
solid
session
beer
for
the
right
price
this
was
much
better
than
the
berry
weiss
the
honey
flavor
is
a
bit
subdued
and
makes
for
an
overall
better
beer
still
feels
a
bit
lackluster
but
not
too
bad
for
a
honey
flavored
beer
drinkability
is
high
as
its
so
light
but
taste
wise
and
body
wise
it
can
improve
immensely
if
it
was
hot
as
balls
out
i
would
really
enjoy
something
light
like
this
but
i
wont
chase
one
down
a
quencher
pours
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
very
little
white
head
thats
gone
in
a
flash
almost
no
aroma
to
speak
of
taste
is
that
of
a
mild
sweet
wheat
beer
the
honey
flavor
is
there
but
its
all
very
muted
i
keep
taking
sips
to
see
if
there
is
anything
else
but
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
drinkability
is
ok
its
really
just
an
average
summer
lawnmower
beer
if
i
were
served
this
beer
in
a
blind
taste
i
might
not
be
quite
as
harsh
but
for
a
beer
that
is
marketed
as
a
premium
craft
beer
this
is
a
shameful
product
really
average
beer
at
the
price
of
good
six
pack
the
flavor
is
muted
the
mouthfeel
flat
and
aroma
and
aftertaste
are
pretty
much
mia
ive
had
their
northwoods
lager
and
other
phonies
and
would
pretty
much
say
the
same
thing
these
beers
are
macro
quality
masquerading
as
micros
poured
at
the
the
former
thunderbird
now
ramada
mall
hotel
in
minneapolis
this
one
shows
a
clear
gold
with
nominal
bubblage
a
modest
white
uneven
cover
and
a
reasonable
bit
of
lacing
it
has
a
simple
cereal
wheat
aroma
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
taste
is
a
fairly
healthy
grainy
grass
and
a
hint
of
malt
modest
carbonation
and
plenty
drinkable
i
poured
this
one
after
a
tiring
day
of
work
followed
by
lawnmowing
edgetrimming
100degree
sweaty
dirty
georgia
goodness
its
quite
refreshing
but
seriously
lacking
in
flavor
i
almost
think
an
ab
budweiser
has
more
character
a
drinkable
beer
it
would
be
a
fine
beer
to
have
a
few
of
on
a
summer
day
sitting
with
your
friends
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
either
drinkability
not
so
good
if
not
for
its
cheapness
id
never
buy
this
pours
an
almost
crystal
clear
pale
straw
color
and
is
topped
by
one
and
a
half
finger
white
head
which
fades
quickly
leaving
a
modicum
of
lacing
behind
smells
of
bananas
grapes
and
lemons
with
a
biscuity
aroma
in
the
background
theres
not
much
going
on
with
the
palate
on
this
one
has
a
hint
of
wheat
and
biscuity
malts
no
hefelike
fruitiness
to
speak
of
a
sweet
undercurrent
of
honey
exists
as
does
a
hint
of
spice
very
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
the
creamy
and
fruity
goodness
involved
in
most
good
hefes
this
brew
poured
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
decent
head
on
top
that
vanished
quickly
the
honey
flavors
were
lost
on
me
but
there
was
a
cloying
sweetness
that
was
ubiquitous
throughout
tasting
it
seemed
like
a
very
mediocre
light
beer
that
was
just
too
sweet
tasting
after
about
half
of
the
glass
the
flavor
develops
a
bit
more
the
honey
is
more
noticeable
with
a
hint
of
lemon
i
suppose
it
would
be
an
okay
session
beer
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
enough
to
be
worth
it
it
barely
differs
from
the
standard
american
macrobrews
could
easily
do
a
session
but
wouldnt
necessarily
want
to
drinkability
pretty
good
session
beer
for
summer
i
wouldnt
turn
another
one
down
pours
a
golden
pilsner

has
minimal
bubble

are

by

as
bright
or

expected
rather
watery

with
a
hint
of
depth
at
the
throat
lightbodied
almost
a
pale

in

iced
tea
sweetness
evaporates
the
initial
honey
approachlacks
the
strength
to
significantly
rate
higher
in
the
taste
category
wont
be
remembered
for
much
more
than
another
leinie
fruit
beer
that
refreshesbut
this
close
to
mikes
hard
lemonade
makes
me
wonder
if
i
should
juts
have
one
of
those
there
are
better
american
wheat
beers
made
out
there
but
i
still
respect
the
small
craft
brewers
even
if
they
sell
out
to
the
big
boys
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
beers
during
the
evening
on
a
summer
day
if
i
wanted
to
nothing
i
plan
to
buy
a
lot
of
drinkability
i
though
i
was
tasting
a
macro
lager
here
goes
down
like
water
not
fond
of
this
one
d
nothing
too
impressive
or
good
just
a
thin
overcarbonated
beer
with
no
taste
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
one
decent
but
not
as
good
as
sunset
wheat
in
my
opinion
not
bad
after
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
nothing
else
very
easy
to
drink
pretty
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
not
much
stands
out
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
d
fairly
drinkable
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
wheat
id
reach
for
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
really
fantastic
though
3
0
truly
not
worth
the
calories
what
a
huge
disappointment
after
i
was
strangely
intrigued
by
the
sunset
wheat
i
actually
liked
that
this
on
the
other
hand
is
a
total
waste
of
time
leinenkugel
got
it
right
with
this
brew
the
honey
is
blended
perfectly
with
this
wheat
beer
crisp
clean
and
extremely
refreshing
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
decent
head
and
good
carbonation
easy
on
the
taste
buds
the
honey
is
just
right
and
does
not
overpower
this
beer
like
the
others
that
i
have
had
not
a
lot
of
complexity
to
this
one
which
is
what
makes
it
a
great
choice
all
in
all
this
was
a
refreshing
brew
but
was
a
far
cry
from
the
style
it
claimed
to
be
a
hard
pour
delivers
a
good
size
head
in
my
pint
glass
the
head
quickly
shrinks
to
just
enough
to
cover
the
surface
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
keeps
this
coating
through
out
the
tasting
light
yellow
in
color
due
to
being
filtered
i
place
my
nose
in
the
glass
a
very
faint
aroma
of
honey
is
detected
tasting
it
shows
though
even
less
of
a
honey
flavor
just
enough
sweetness
to
be
refreshing
not
really
picking
up
any
of
the
usual
weiss
flavors
clove
banana
not
really
getting
a
hop
taste
except
a
little
in
the
aftertaste
i
can
see
having
a
couple
on
the
patio
pours
a
crisp
light
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
was
very
slight
sweet
malt
but
barely
even
that
the
taste
was
just
a
slight
bit
better
than
bmc
really
nothing
special
not
even
any
characteristics
of
a
wheat
beer
the
beer
was
very
light
but
very
watery
this
is
not
one
id
try
again
but
not
quite
a
drain
pour
either
im
lost
on
the
popularity
of
this
beer
the
marketing
vp
at
leinies
s
get
a
big
raise
cuz
there
is
no
way
this
beer
got
this
popular
by
its
taste
alone
i
can
handle
a
couple
glasses
from
a
really
fresh
keg
if
someone
else
is
buying
but
thats
about
the
nicest
thing
i
can
say
about
it
d
a
good
wheat
beer
with
the
honey
adding
some
slight
sweetness
and
keeping
it
from
becoming
too
dry
drinkability
is
moderate
a
nice
unoffensive
light
wheat
ale
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
subdued
flavors
but
easydrinking
pours
with
small
head
that
actually
stays
around
for
20
seconds
or
so
aroma
slight
hint
of
honey
and
alcohol
smell
appearence
clear
blonde
color
flovor
was
average
its
not
a
swill
beer
but
nothing
there
to
really
get
your
taste
buds
going
decent
price
at
5
99
a
six
could
hardly
taste
the
honey
in
this
beer
ive
had
way
better
wheat
beers
before
nothing
special
clear
lemon
pour
not
much
in
the
way
of
white
head
no
aroma
at
all
nuttin
happening
here
taste
was
more
of
a
soapy
pilsner
than
a
honey
wheat
body
was
crisp
and
thin
decent
drinking
in
the
summer
heat
but
find
a
beer
with
more
taste
d
refreshing
but
not
tasty
i
was
dissapointed
with
this
beer
it
really
seemed
more
like
a
normal
run
of
the
day
lager
no
fruity
esters
or
wheat
taste
i
wonder
how
much
wheat
is
in
it
id
venture
to
guess
less
than
50
which
in
my
mind
disqualifies
it
as
a
wheat
beer
sorry
d
not
nearly
as
drinkable
as
the
other
leines
i
finished
a
six
pack
but
it
took
over
a
week
to
have
the
desire
to
sit
down
for
each
one
and
i
could
only
take
one
at
a
time
taste
wise
i
do
regret
paying
the
7
99
for
this
sixer
md
not
to
light
and
not
to
heavy
of
a
feel
the
head
is
creamy
and
the
brew
doesnt
leave
your
mouth
super
dry
a
superb
thirst
quencher
and
good
drinkability
this
honey
weiss
does
not
improve
much
on
their
other
pale
wheat
it
shares
a
similar
yellow
color
and
has
a
marginal
beige
head
the
nose
and
taste
were
both
light
and
grainy
a
decent
body
has
to
open
up
to
loose
some
of
the
carbonation
the
honey
flavor
is
a
bit
artificial
to
balance
well
d
light
interesting
light
complexity
basically
enjoyable
and
relatively
thirst
quenching
not
bad
d
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
since
the
flavor
is
not
that
impressive
i
would
not
have
many
more
of
these
d
although
drinkable
not
something
id
buy
a
full
case
of
i
have
six
bottles
from
their
adventure
sampler
and
thats
plenty
for
me
the
feel
is
a
slightly
bubbly
lagery
feel
somewhat
dry
its
a
light
minor
drin
pleasant
enough
though
good
for
summer
goes
down
easy
for
sure
md
feels
real
good
with
a
lightbody
and
slight
carbonation
that
downs
easy
d
moderate
and
one
for
the
beach
or
for
newcomers
to
beer
and
the
lassies
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
like
some
sort
of
beersoda
hybrid
that
was
very
light
and
very
carbonated
highly
drinkable
but
i
just
wouldnt
want
many
more
drinkability
this
is
what
the
beer
was
obviously
made
to
do
very
drinkable
and
clean
too
much
so
dwould
be
better
on
a
hot
day
im
sureoverall
very
average
d
very
drinkable
beer
easy
to
handle
and
a
good
transition
beer
with
no
strong
taste
will
make
for
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
d
not
my
favorite
leinenkugel
offering
its
refreshing
but
it
tastes
just
like
an
american
wheat
with
nothing
spectacular
going
for
it
it
is
a
warm
day
and
i
am
enjoying
it
though
d
drinkable
enough
but
there
is
not
a
lot
of
uniqueness
in
this
brew
to
suggest
it
a
seethru
straw
yellow
body
with
a
onefinger
head
that
died
and
left
no
lacings
the
first
time
i
got
a
small
head
with
my
hefe
glass
a
very
strong
citric
smell
tart
even
with
some
spiciness
also
hitting
the
nose
the
tart
citric
smell
is
also
in
the
taste
but
it
is
a
little
too
much
and
this
beer
is
not
as
smooth
as
it
should
be
as
the
honey
seems
to
be
overpowered
and
it
is
a
little
too
crisp
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
hefeswheatweiss
beers
and
summer
seasonals
are
my
favorite
but
this
is
one
that
i
will
skip
in
a
crowded
marketplace
12oz
twistoff
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
the
aroma
is
sweet
honey
faint
grainy
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
honey
up
front
followed
by
the
grainy
malt
and
a
mild
hop
finish
the
taste
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
and
could
use
a
little
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweet
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
from
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
macro
lager
with
some
honey
added
i
doubt
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
yellow
color
with
1
pinky
of
bubbly
white
head
some
retention
spotty
lacing
smells
of
wheat
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
some
lemon
taste
is
very
biscuitlike
with
honey
and
vanilla
and
a
finish
of
lemon
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
sweet
with
a
crisp
finish
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
going
on
to
really
excite
the
palate
when
i
picked
this
one
out
i
expected
what
i
got
pours
a
bright
clear
gold
with
an
unusually
white
head
smells
of
honey
off
the
comb
and
a
little
wheat
esters
tastes
a
bit
thin
but
up
front
honey
and
a
little
wheat
undertones
pretty
easy
drinking
and
an
alright
after
dinner
drink
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
quickly
faded
to
the
beer
and
no
lace
weak
smell
of
cooked
veggies
matchs
the
taste
thats
all
i
want
to
say
about
that
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
carbonation
weak
drinkability
zero
before
i
drank
this
i
didnt
know
leinenkugels
made
a
beer
not
infused
with
fruit
so
i
had
to
try
it
it
has
a
nice
subtle
honey
taste
but
no
extreme
flavors
popping
out
on
your
tongue
nicely
carbonated
and
an
average
head
about
1
5
fingers
overall
its
a
little
bland
for
me
like
a
fizzy
yellow
american
beer
with
a
little
better
ingredients
with
honey
added
i
think
ill
stick
with
what
leine
does
best
and
thats
fruit
infused
beers
top
it
off
overly
carbonated
and
watery
12oz
bottle
from
tiger
town
in
gardiner
pours
a
very
light
yellow
translucent
body
with
virtually
no
head
smells
of
some
lemon
and
vanilla
faintly
tastes
like
biscuit
malt
with
hints
of
lemon
and
hints
of
diacetyl
very
light
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
to
make
this
a
refreshing
easy
drinker
the
flavor
though
while
okay
isnt
great
and
certainly
isnt
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
its
just
not
memorable
and
basically
average
all
around
its
easy
as
hell
to
drink
and
makes
for
a
decent
thirst
quencher
in
the
summer
but
i
can
still
think
of
many
others
that
id
grab
in
the
hot
summer
months
before
this
one
d
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
this
beer
had
good
potential
but
did
not
live
up
to
anything
easily
a
below
average
brew
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
am
proud
to
say
its
brewed
only
an
hour
and
a
half
away
from
my
home
if
you
havent
had
a
honey
weiss
you
need
to
try
one
and
see
what
the
buzz
is
about
d
for
me
not
much
but
on
average
probably
acceptable
to
most
d
nothing
too
suprising
here
not
great
but
not
bad
seems
a
little
typical
but
ok
for
the
style
im
a
little
biased
though
because
it
takes
something
extra
for
this
style
to
impress
me
leinenkugels
did
nothing
for
me
it
wasnt
complex
in
taste
and
certainly
didnt
distinguish
itself
in
any
way
quite
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
honey
aspect
pretty
wellincorporated
into
the
wheat
aspect
not
bad
for
a
basic
american
pale
wheat
ale
this
beer
was
a
honey
color
with
a
relatively
transparent
body
no
real
head
minimal
at
best
with
no
real
lacing
this
beer
didnt
have
much
of
of
a
smell
there
was
some
notes
of
malt
and
in
no
way
any
sweetness
as
expected
in
the
title
this
is
an
average
beer
at
best
i
enjoy
leinenkugels
beer
however
this
is
not
one
of
the
best
examples
there
is
a
higher
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
with
this
brew
ok
in
a
variety
pack
but
not
much
to
buy
on
its
own
it
looks
like
a
macro
but
its
not
really
it
smells
like
a
macro
but
its
not
really
what
saves
it
from
macrohood
though
is
the
flavor
which
while
far
from
impressive
is
at
least
well
tastier
than
most
macros
and
this
helps
make
it
roughly
average
read
mediocre
in
its
drinkability
sure
sucking
down
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
might
be
doable
however
im
not
sure
i
would
look
this
way
because
its
not
often
this
would
be
the
best
i
have
on
hand
verdict
similar
to
j
w
dundees
honey
brown
due
to
being
a
beer
with
honey
in
it
just
not
very
impressive
here
drinkable
but
you
arent
missing
anything
if
you
havent
had
it
already
all
in
all
a
decent
refreshing
beer
nothing
more
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
in
the
heat
the
only
problem
is
that
it
is
a
little
too
boring
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
poured
this
into
my
weisen
glass
absolutely
clear
light
orange
you
literally
could
read
through
this
a
thin
layer
of
suds
lay
on
top
and
left
zero
lacing
smell
is
comparable
to
a
musty
barnyard
but
with
hints
of
some
zesty
fruit
mainly
lemon
not
very
appetizing
taste
is
essentially
nonconfrontational
there
isnt
too
much
there
i
noticed
some
honey
as
advertised
but
its
quite
subtle
some
citrus
is
apparent
i
didnt
even
notice
any
wheat
until
the
aftertaste
body
is
extremely
light
and
it
is
overly
carbonated
boooring
prosit
mk
this
brilliantly
clear
gold
beer
w
34
inch
head
that
recedes
is
not
an
ale
at
all
i
would
bet
but
a
lager
there
is
some
subtle
malty
flavor
that
makes
it
reminiscent
of
a
german
lager
and
the
maltyness
alone
makes
it
better
than
the
american
lagers
but
it
has
no
wheat
beer
flavors
american
and
especially
bavarian
that
said
its
subtle
barley
sweetness
tastes
better
than
many
american
lagers
and
its
easy
drinking
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
theres
nothing
wrong
about
that
d
this
isnt
great
but
it
would
make
an
okay
session
beer
it
certainly
is
easy
drinking
d
the
aggressive
carboantion
distracts
and
hurts
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
drank
like
a
macro
produced
american
wheat
then
again
ab
does
have
their
hand
in
the
pot
in
a
word
watery
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
im
a
leinies
lodge
card
holder
it
looked
great
nice
gold
color
in
the
glass
decent
head
nice
carbonation
a
bit
of
sweet
wheat
very
little
in
the
nose
smelled
like
beer
and
it
tasted
good
e
g
refreshing
but
a
bit
watery
in
the
taste
department
you
could
throw
back
a
bunch
of
these
and
really
enjoy
them
nothing
bad
in
the
taste
dept
no
metallic
no
strange
bitterness
no
stale
flavors
etc
but
when
you
start
rating
a
beer
by
what
its
not
you
had
probably
better
move
on
to
something
more
flavorful
that
said
id
definitely
buy
this
for
my
summer
bbq
parties
it
would
go
well
with
food
pours
light
yellow
with
short
lasting
white
head
looks
like
a
light
lager
basically
smell
is
light
but
slight
honey
and
malt
taste
is
decent
crisp
from
the
moderately
high
carbonation
and
mildly
sweet
from
the
honey
and
lingers
for
just
a
bit
in
the
after
taste
along
with
just
a
touch
of
wheatiness
this
doesnt
taste
bad
by
any
means
but
is
very
light
and
simple
a
good
replacement
for
a
cheap
lager
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
to
blow
you
away
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
is
best
quaffed
during
a
hot
day
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
making
it
a
good
session
brew
buy
honey
brown
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
brew
as
it
is
low
in
alcohol
light
and
tasty
and
it
also
is
a
great
crossover
brew
leading
some
bmc
drinkers
to
the
craft
brew
world
sparkley
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fizzes
out
quick
i
dont
smell
much
of
anything
i
detect
a
kind
of
grainy
earthy
odor
but
thats
it
no
honey
or
anything
special
it
kind
of
just
smells
like
a
miller
high
life
eh
a
little
better
than
that
maybe
but
not
much
i
think
i
can
pick
up
a
subtle
hint
of
honey
in
the
taste
however
it
has
a
grainy
aftertaste
anyway
its
light
a
touch
of
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
a
gimmick
beer
i
think
with
leinenkugels
beers
ill
stick
with
the
sunset
wheat
and
big
butt
dopplebock
those
are
good
but
ill
avoid
the
red
and
the
honey
weiss
and
those
are
the
four
that
ive
have
had
from
this
brewer
so
far
but
at
prices
similar
to
bud
miller
etc
id
take
leinenkugels
for
sure
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
brews
had
high
hopes
for
their
honey
weiss
which
didnt
disappoint
pours
a
lucid
clear
applejuice
color
average
appearnce
with
minimal
head
that
soon
dissipated
not
much
to
talk
about
in
way
of
appearance
overall
the
smell
was
rather
bland
and
not
too
enticing
more
average
than
anything
else
taste
was
very
crisp
clear
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
sweet
honey
taste
citrus
fruitlike
flavor
that
was
typical
of
the
brewery
very
satisfying
and
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
definitely
a
beer
for
the
warmerweather
months
good
mouthfeel
although
slightly
light
and
watery
and
very
easy
drinkability
that
went
down
like
gatorade
no
alcohol
or
bitterness
deteced
at
all
an
average
sample
from
leinenkugel
although
their
sunset
wheat
is
certainly
a
clear
winner
worth
a
try
overall
i
liked
the
beer
even
though
i
am
not
a
pale
ale
lover
it
was
okay
id
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wont
go
out
and
buy
it
myself
i
really
didnt
like
this
one
the
first
time
and
like
it
less
this
time
around
if
it
was
available
in
boise
i
would
buy
a
few
and
try
to
turn
my
macro
drinking
coworkers
and
then
chastise
them
for
ever
liking
it
overall
very
middleoftheroad
i
expected
more
out
of
this
onei
should
have
read
the
reviews
here
first
slight
honey
aroma
pours
very
clear
and
pale
yellow
with
a
diminishing
white
head
flavor
is
very
light
with
nothing
that
stands
out
i
dont
get
any
sweetness
or
honey
flavorit
is
pretty
much
flavorless
with
a
light
mouthfeel
very
dry
with
no
aftertaste
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
im
going
to
buy
again
pours
crystal
clear
with
a
firm
gold
color
minimal
head
and
minimal
lacing
smell
is
mild
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
most
likely
from
the
honey
taste
is
definitely
honey
influenced
but
not
that
much
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
overall
it
seems
like
a
typical
beer
that
just
got
a
shot
in
the
arm
with
the
honey
i
have
never
had
a
wheat
brew
that
was
this
light
before
something
to
try
once
but
nothing
worth
running
to
the
end
of
the
earth
for
leinies
honey
weiss
is
what
it
is
an
average
american
wheat
beer
everything
about
it
is
pretty
unimpressive
the
main
thing
i
can
say
to
its
credit
is
that
the
honey
aspect
is
nicely
done
its
not
at
all
a
cloying
sugary
honey
flavor
the
beer
is
very
light
goldyellow
in
appearance
without
much
head
to
speak
of
its
fairly
smooth
tasting
with
grass
being
the
prevalent
flavor
on
my
tongue
a
good
yard
beer
very
clear
golden
color
disturbingly
clear
and
gold
much
like
an
american
macro
or
piss
white
head
disappears
to
a
very
thin
collar
and
leaves
no
lacing
smell
is
pretty
close
to
a
macro
too
with
something
else
maybe
green
apples
not
really
much
honey
there
i
dont
know
if
it
would
have
helped
though
nothing
interesting
in
there
taste
is
very
similar
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
have
this
beer
again
even
if
the
gf
wants
a
couple
more
bottles
truly
not
a
good
beer
well
below
average
its
a
nice
golden
color
and
is
very
clear
it
has
some
mild
carbonation
and
a
good
thick
head
that
thins
out
and
has
a
little
lacing
to
it
it
smelled
a
little
sweet
and
i
could
barley
pick
up
on
the
wheat
in
it
it
just
wasnt
very
big
on
aroma
it
has
a
smooth
semicrisp
sweet
flavor
and
is
a
little
bit
bitter
with
a
fairly
light
mouth
feel
the
aftertaste
certainly
brings
out
the
bitterness
in
it
but
its
not
overwhelming
overall
a
quaffable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
want
much
of
d
its
a
step
above
a
macro
but
not
buy
much
id
rather
drink
this
than
bmc
poured
a
macrolagerlooking
yellow
with
little
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
aroma
was
weak
with
a
bit
of
skunk
to
it
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
wheat
ale
to
me
slight
hint
of
honey
in
the
taste
but
the
flavor
is
weak
not
offensive
by
any
means
just
a
little
weak
for
my
tastes
i
would
not
seek
this
out
i
was
excited
to
see
this
for
sale
in
philadelphia
in
a
variety
pack
since
i
can
only
get
the
sunset
wheat
in
new
york
well
the
honey
weisse
was
a
big
disappointment
i
mean
big
there
was
nothing
to
this
beer
i
think
id
even
drink
a
rolling
rock
over
this
im
just
wondering
if
i
got
some
bad
ones
because
the
red
lager
and
sunset
wheats
in
the
pack
were
very
nice
p
s
the
other
beer
in
the
pack
was
the
creamy
dark
not
that
good
either
i
am
not
very
big
on
this
beer
tried
it
several
times
and
its
actually
never
been
very
bad
but
its
also
never
been
good
the
idea
that
they
even
include
honey
or
weiss
in
the
name
of
this
one
is
beyond
me
as
it
doesnt
seem
to
include
either
just
a
plain
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
for
all
im
concerned
done
of
my
favorite
light
beers
like
i
stated
above
the
honey
is
very
light
and
can
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
beers
pale
colored
beer
with
an
almost
nonexistent
aroma
taste
is
water
with
a
faint
hint
of
honey
although
no
sweetness
is
detected
i
cant
slam
this
beer
because
although
its
tasteless
it
is
by
no
means
repulsive
you
can
get
the
same
taste
from
a
ice
cold
coors
light
for
half
the
price
this
beer
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
leinenkugels
main
offerings
smell
is
not
very
strong
and
not
very
distinct
this
is
refreshing
but
fairly
basic
i
can
taste
a
hint
of
honey
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
though
i
have
to
say
given
the
very
dense
taste
of
the
blue
moon
honey
beer
i
had
recently
maybe
it
is
better
to
err
on
the
side
of
lessdense
rather
than
more
dense
for
a
honeyladen
beer
overall
though
im
a
leinies
fan
this
is
not
particularly
special
overall
this
is
another
ok
beer
from
leinenkugel
the
crispness
and
thirst
quenching
qualities
would
probably
be
better
served
at
a
cooler
temperature
again
i
wish
texas
could
get
some
of
leinys
good
beers
like
creamy
dark
as
it
is
i
like
this
better
than
the
sunset
wheat
but
that
is
not
saying
much
i
can
make
out
an
odd
distinct
champagne
like
sweetness
and
carbonation
for
some
reason
and
it
is
a
turn
off
for
me
dont
know
what
to
say
i
was
pretty
excited
about
trying
this
delicious
wisconsin
brew
but
was
a
bit
disappointed
nice
color
with
nice
head
but
the
smells
are
of
a
regular
plain
hoppy
ale
or
even
a
lager
tastes
have
hints
of
honey
and
sweet
malts
but
not
a
lot
mainly
hops
and
a
milky
taste
but
nothing
too
spectacular
oddly
enough
i
agree
with
many
reviews
when
they
say
it
reminds
me
a
macro
because
the
honey
and
sweetness
is
not
present
enough
to
say
that
this
is
a
wonderful
craft
ale
overall
wisconsin
has
much
better
brews
to
offer
dont
settle
for
this
rather
plain
one
drinkability
is
great
there
isnt
much
here
to
lower
drinkability
this
is
a
light
brew
without
any
bold
or
excessive
flavors
mild
and
refreshing
which
is
just
what
it
is
trying
to
be
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
honey
and
cheap
lager
i
guess
there
is
what
you
could
call
honey
sweetness
in
the
flavor
it
also
has
a
cheap
lager
type
flavor
to
it
im
not
impressed
easy
to
drink
but
why
bother
drinkability
i
would
drink
it
again
d
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
like
these
we
all
grow
up
i
suppose
but
if
i
were
going
to
drink
a
leine
id
stick
with
a
red
uninteresting
hardly
more
flavorful
than
sweet
water
d
accessible
but
not
enticing
d
this
one
is
drinkable
but
not
very
enjoyable
drinkability
on
the
same
level
as
your
average
macro
lager
this
beer
was
unoffensive
but
a
letdown
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
sunset
wheat
is
a
much
better
offering
from
leines
eric
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
sweetness
one
is
enough
drinkability
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
goes
down
easily
perfect
for
summer
overall
this
seemed
like
a
very
insipid
and
uninspired
beer
it
has
some
flavor
but
nothing
amazing
wow
where
to
begin
with
this
one
leinenkugel
has
brewed
some
fine
beers
that
i
really
enjoy
red
lager
sunset
wheat
come
to
mind
so
i
figured
why
not
try
this
honey
weiss
this
beer
absolutly
reeks
it
more
or
less
tastes
like
a
waterdown
stale
natural
light
there
was
little
to
no
head
mouthfeel
was
nonexistent
and
it
looks
like
a
falls
city
lager
on
its
best
day
i
picked
up
a
bottle
while
shopping
at
target
of
all
places
stay
clear
of
this
one
fellas
if
you
are
gonna
try
something
from
leinenkugel
try
anything
but
this
will
not
buy
again
second
of
the
sampler
pack
so
far
so
bad
fizzy
yellow
with
very
little
head
lacing
is
okay
head
retention
is
not
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
maybe
slightly
skunky
smells
of
adjunct
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
no
honey
at
all
mild
wheat
but
also
other
weak
grain
tastes
very
thin
having
had
sunset
wheat
before
this
one
i
thought
leinenkugels
might
actually
be
decent
at
that
style
but
this
one
proved
me
wrong
no
honey
no
weiss
no
honey
weiss
light
malt
aroma
with
some
residual
citrus
fruit
smell
very
crisp
and
clean
flavor
slight
honey
taste
but
not
enough
to
be
overly
sweet
or
cloying
clean
wheat
malt
with
a
dryish
finish
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
a
good
summer
time
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
can
see
as
a
session
beer
maybe
your
buddies
who
drink
nothing
other
than
miller
light
will
enjoy
this
one
out
this
one
again
when
there
are
so
many
better
alternatives
out
there
d
this
stuff
sucks
light
flavored
not
quite
as
malty
as
some
of
this
style
i
think
one
problem
with
this
is
the
glass
that
it
came
in
i
ordered
the
22
oz
size
draught
and
it
came
in
a
large
thick
soda
glass
not
a
large
halfliter
weizen
glass
that
it
shouldve
been
served
in
i
will
hold
that
against
tony
romas
at
the
mall
of
america
not
leinies
this
had
a
light
lagered
flavor
so
to
give
it
a
kick
i
went
against
the
norm
and
dropped
in
the
lemon
wedge
that
came
with
the
glass
it
did
help
a
little
if
you
want
a
good
summery
beer
and
you
live
within
the
leinies
distribution
area
i
will
give
this
a
good
recommendation
once
summer
is
over
youll
want
to
switch
to
something
different
but
this
will
do
nicely
during
for
the
season
poured
from
the

not

much
on
the
flavor
but
what
is
there
isnt
bad
d
fairly
drinkable
beer
to
me
it
leaves
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
is
slightly
unpleasnt

i
still
enjoy
this
beer

drinkable
but
pretty
straightforward
in
its

overall
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
certainly
not
a
wheat
ale
but
with
the
lemon
element
more
like
a
very
drinkable
macro
summer
ale
thanks
to
makeitavintage
for
this
one
the
appearance
is
a
light

a

beer
doesnt

buy
a

not
a

i
seemed
to
have
liked
this
beer
better
from
the
bottle
on
tap
i
didnt
get
much
wheat
or
honey
out
of
the
flavor
aroma
or
texture
the
beer
shows
up
as
clear
as
any
other
pilsner
that
i
have
drank
no
real
head
retention
to
mention
smells
and
tastes
like
cereal
grains
with
no
wheat
esters
sweetness
or
breadiness
the
there
is
an
additional
artificial
sweetness
that
may
loosely
resemble
honey
the
beer
falls
weak
and
watery
quickly
leaving
a
bitter
grainhusk
biteey
sensation
that
lingered
into
the
aftertaste
didnt
really
care
much
for
this
on

the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
nice
carbonation
and
weak
head
the
mouthful
is
nice
and
crisp
the
wheat
taste
is
crisp
without
the
grainy
yeast
texture
the
honey
sweatens
the
deal
a
little
without
being
overbearing
the
hops
are
nicely
matched

out

thick
retention

weak
taste
is
a
combination
of
a
moderately
crisp
wheat
flavor
and
an
underlying
honeytinged
malt
sweetness
the
honey
is
used
well
here
it
enhances
the
malt
flavor
without
taking
over
wheat
flavor
becomes
most
apparent
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
nice
stab
at
the
american
pale
wheat
style
mouthfeel
was
average
as
average
could
be
not
too
carbonated
at
all
but
average
weight
on
the
tounge
im
not
a
real
weiss
beer
fan
and
this
beer
sure
as
hell
didnt
convince
me
otherwise
yellowishred
appearance
with
a
nice
head
was
about
all
it
really
had
going
for
it
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
just
not
anything
that
made
it
special
most
likely
wont
be
drinking
this
again
since
there
are
way
too
many
beers
that
are
so
much
better
overall
a
very
light
bodied
but
highly
drinkable
beer
carbonation
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
macro
but
it
does
have
a
nice
clean
crisp
finish
nothing
really
good
or
bad
about
this
beer
drinks
okay
in
the
spring
but
not
sweet
or
complex
enough
to
reccomend
to
other
than
fans
of
the
style
or
curiosity
seekers
part

i
received
as
a
gift
quite
a
light
golden
color
with
a
medium
creamy
white
head
moderate
carbonation
and
lacing
aroma
is
lighter
with
a
honey
touch
and
maybe
a
bit
of
a
grassy
note
taste
is
also
light
i
dont
taste
too
much
wheat
but
more
of
a
lighter
honey
aspect
and
a
bready
kind
of
taste
there
is
a
lighter
grassy
aspect
towards
the
finish
and
somewhat
in
the
body
the
honey
seems
to
be
done
well
i
notice
it
but
its
not
too
cloying
like
i
thought
it
might
be
still
this
is
a
take
it
or
leave
it
type
beer
fairly
average
by
all
accounts
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
very
easy
drinking
beer
good
for
those
who
want
an
alternative
to
the
typical
macros
but
more
experiences
beer
drinkers
will
probably
find
this
bland
d
a
very
easy
drinking
and
simple
brew
an
obvious
pick
for
a
summer
time
beer
or
even
a
stepping
stone
brew
for
the
drinking
impaired
paired
well
with
some
pickled
herring
and
stone
ground
wheat
crackers
dits
ok
as
i
remember
it
works
pretty
well
with
the
buffalo
wings
that
i
am
eating
might
be
good
for
the
upcoming
warm
months
but
it
lacks
dominate
flavors
im
rereviewing
this
brew
as
i
feel
my
first
review
was
too
critical
and
perhaps
the
bottle
i
had
wasnt
the
freshest
poured
out
to
a
fairly
typcial
yellow
color
with
vigorus
carbonation
and
a
small
head
of
white
foam
aromas
of
honey
and
hops
some
watery
malt
taste
is
quaffable
for
a
hot
summer
day
malt
hints
of
wood
laden
honey
earth
a
touch
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
ok
very
macrocarbonated
if
you
will
fair
drinkability
its
not
bad
its
just
not
all
that
good
smells
like
a
pale
lager
looks
like
a
pale
lager
and
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
pale
lager
booorrrring
the
drinkability
is
okay
but
nothing
great
because
of
the
wierd
hops
this
whole
beer
is
just
average
drinability
its
a
session
thats
fo
sho
pale
yellow
color
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
really
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
light
pale
malts
and
a
hint
of
spiciness
couldnt
pick
up
much
honey
but
there
may
be
a
bit
lingering
there
flavor
is
weak
malts
and
tastes
quite
cheap
and
macroish
no
real
hearty
wheat
character
if
there
was
more
honey
flavor
and
more
wheat
to
round
this
thing
out
this
might
be
a
respectable
brew
as
it
is
it
was
ok
to
have
a
few
free
glasses
on
the
house
but
its
not
something
id
run
out
to
buy
this
beer
came
a
bright
gold
with
a
touch
of
orange
with
a
haze
of
bubbles
sustaining
a
thin
larger
bubbled
head
smells
of
dirty
corn
with
a
comical
honey
flavor
and
candy
sourness
tastes
of
more
dirty
corn
with
a
sharp
sourness
an
added
lemon
makes
this
a
bit
more
manageable
with
a
decisive
honeylike
finish
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
a
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
nonintrusive
and
relatively
flavorful
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
in
my
opinion
this
is
just
a
good
solid
beer
its
not
fantastic
and
wont
set
the
world
on
fire
but
its
good
i
think
it
has
a
very
clean
flavor
the
color
is
also
good
more
clear
than
id
expect
for
a
wheat
beer
the
smell
is
also
good
i
also
smelled
a
yeastwheat
smell
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
also
good
like
i
said
its
just
a
good
solid
beer
ill
say
it
ranks
as
better
than
most
in
my
book
drinkability
goes
down
easy
but
at
the
high
price
of
flavor
not
bad
but
you
could
do
a
lot
better
with
a
different
leinies
finishes
very
slightly
dry
easy
to
drink
fairly
smooth
drink
it
with
spicy
food
and
save
the
good
stuff
for
another
time
drinkability
not
real
good
not
something
id
keep
around
the
taste
was
rather
plain
similar
to
a
macro
with
no
hops
the
malt
was
really
the
only
flavor
and
it
tasted
more
like
pale
or
base
malts
no
real
wheat
flavor
and
no
real
weizen
flavor
the
body
was
very
light
and
really
more
of
a
watery
taste
to
it
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
pale
golden
and
bubbly
in
appearance
looks
like
your
standard
macro
smells
adjuncty
and
malty
sweet
thats
about
it
tastes
adjuncty
and
maltyhoney
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
macro
bubbly
and
thin
it
take
it
over
a
bmc
any
day
but
there
isnt
much
to
praise
here
a
sweet
malty
drinker
gets
the
job
done
drinkability
no
this
is
not
a
great
beer
not
really
all
that
good
either
but
that
bad
just
boring
but
this
price
is
nice
so
you
could
spend
more
and
end
up
with
something
worse
i
guess
but
its
still
a
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
bothering
with
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
either
paid
4
99
for
a
6
pack
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
no
head
isnt
thsi
supposed
to
be
a
wheat
beer
and
thus
have
a
cloudy
appearance
with
a
big
head
the
stench
is
of
aour
piss
the
taste
is
not
unlike
the
stench
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
a
horrilbe
beer
my
speculation
is
that
the
people
at
leinenkugal
call
corn
wheat
and
wheat
corn
there
is
certainly
no
detectable
wheat
in
the
beer
straw
yellow
color
fluffy
white
head
not
a
bold
tasting
wheat
as
for
honey
in
the
flavor
im
hard
press
in
finding
it
with
this
beer
if
sweetness
was
what
the
honey
brought
to
the
table
its
there
the
beer
had
a
very
dry
finish
which
i
though
took
away
from
it
being
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
appearance
is
clear
yellow
and
an
aggressive
pour
yields
a
decent
white
head
of
foam
that
disperses
quickly
aroma
is
not
pleasant
containing
a
little
malt
and
other
unidentifiable
ingredients

but
honey
isnt
one
of
them
the
taste
is
boring
and
unbelievably
lacking
in
one
ingredient

beer
over
carbonated
and
a
dismal
disappointment
nothing
impressive
and
is
it
just
me
or
can
anybody
really
taste
the
honey
being
from
minnesota
i
see
this
stuff
everywhere
and
i
have
to
admit
it
is
an
affordable
brew
for
those
last
few
days
before
the
next
pay
check
definatly
does
not
stand
out
amoungst
other
simiar
beers
in
its
class
real
glad
to
try
this
one
thanks
again
zap
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
stuff
have
had
it
many
times
in
years
past
found
a
leinies
12
pack

for
6
99
on
closeout
probably
the
only
way
you
could
convince
me
to
buy
it
clear
gold
in
color
almost
no
head
just
a
couple
bubbles
smell
is
of
nothing
much
light
malt
and
something
adjuncty
taste
is
unimpressive
and
boring
the
little
sweetness
that
the
honey
imparts
doesnt
make
up
for
how
poorly
crafted
this
stuff
is
not
a
very
good
beer
aviod
unless
you
get
a
deal
like
i
did
brought
this
back
from
my
trip
to
minnesota
along
with
quite
a
few
others
from
leinenkugels
the
body
to
this
brew
is
like
no
other
and
i
cant
say
its
particularly
good
its
lighter
than
golden
and
literally
is
almost
water
colored
but
slightly
hazy
very
strange
there
is
a
good
frothy
bleach
white
head
however
the
nose
is
mostly
pale
with
some
hints
of
honey
to
come
the
mouthfeel
has
an
edgy
pin
prickly
feel
there
is
certainly
a
full
malt
character
in
this
offering
and
the
honey
notes
are
a
lot
more
subtle
than
i
would
have
suspected
in
the
finish
you
get
a
nice
peppery
compliment
to
the
mellowing
honey
character
very
average
overall
this
brew
tasted
like
a
very
average
lager
to
me
if
it
had
some
honey
for
weiss
qualities
it
would
be
a
bit
more
enjoyable
but
it
almost
seemed
like
false
advertising
a
very
unmemorable
experience
by
and
large
an
unimpressive
beer
i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
drink
this
as
their
beer
because
its
affordable
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
its
drinkable
but
only
as
a
last
resort
the
flavor
is
very
bland
with
little
distinction
but
it
isnt
distinguished
or
otherwise
worthy
of
note
as
far
as
leineys
beers
go
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
oat
the
beer
with
a
nice
active
carbonation
as
well
the
nose
is
slightly
honey
sweet
but
also
a
little
harsh
grainey
tones
as
well
the
flvor
is
strong
grain
with
a
honey
sweetness
on
the
finish
not
bad
for
an
american
wheat
the
feel
is
on
the
light
side
of
moderate
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
there
are
some
shortcomings
but
its
servicable
thin
on
the
body
like
a
macro
but
its
pretty
darn
smooth
and
you
can
pound
these
all
night
it
has
a
straw
color
apperence
with
little
head
or
lacing
its
suppose
to
taste
like
honey
but
i
tasted
only
hops
and
wheat
basically
the
good
thing
is
its
a
beer
and
not
water
but
the
taste
is
average
for
a
wheat
ale
of
its
kind
i
was
not
great
but
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
if
thats
the
best
you
have
this
is
a
pretty
beer
bright
straw
in
color
with
a
white
head
not
much
lacing
however
not
much
in
the
aroma
some
maltiness
and
yeast
but
no
hops
and
no
honey
the
flavor
is
nice
sweet
and
then
yeasty
with
that
wheat
aftertaste
how
much
honey
is
in
this
i
wonder
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
good
at
a
picnic
a
ballgame
or
the
golf
course
pours
a
nice
light
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
i
could
barely
taste
the
honey
this
stuff
pours
light
straw
not
even
slight
malt
notes
just
light

aspects
with

s

at

disregard
those
scores
o
i
like
beers
a
lot
and
so
like
to
try
new
ones
this
isnt
one
i
would
choose
again
but
really
it
is
from
a
great
company
the
bottle
is
cool
i
like
their
style
if
you
cant
stand
the
yeast
floating
in
your
beer
you
could
try
this
but
its
not
as
good
as
weihenstephaners
kristall
o
not
super
complex
but
drinkabilty
is
even
better
than
in
common
hefes
overall
an
highly
enjoyable
easy
beer
this
however
is
definitely
much
better
as
others
have
said
its
crisp
and
clean
but
still
tastes
great
the
carbonation
is
bit
much
but
overall
this
is
still
one
of
my
favourite
beers
had
a
5l
bottle
in
germany
its
crisp
and
clean
almost
like
a
kolsch
or
low
bitterness
pilsner
theres
still
a
soft
bready
aroma
with
a
peppery
clove
edge
theres
a
hint
of
banana
mixed
in
too
and
as
you
might
expect
this
tastes
like
a
cleaned
up
schneider
hefe
a
slightly
sweet
bready
malt
flavor
rolls
over
the
tongue
but
theres
a
drier
finish
this
beer
seems
a
little
more
crisp
and
refreshing
id
prefer
schneider
original
but
this
was
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
while
traveling
o
lovely
and
crisp
with
pure
clean
flavours
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
i
was
blown
away
by
my
first
bottle
but
i
drank
it
when
i
was
parched
so
i
was
overly
astute
the
few
ive
had
since
have
not
been
very
tasty
definitely
better
when
thoroughly
chilled
and
left
out
of
the
fridge
for
10
mins
a
very
refreshing
beer
if
youve
had
a
busy
day
in
the
sun
o
as
this
beers
warms
it
becomes
remarkably
more
peach
flavoured
at
first
this
was
scarcely
detectable
but
as
i
consume
more
its
becoming
much
more
obvious
in
both
taste
and
aroma
the
sweetness
could
be
slightly
overpowering
for
some
but
otherwise
this
is
a
very
interesting
example
of
this
style
of
beer
a
really
really
good
kristalweizen
im
not
sure
ive
had
a
better
one
one
with
more
flavour
and
character
or
so
well
constructed
all
up
schneider
do
do
an
excellent
range
of
wheat
beers
and
with
this
they
show
what
can
be
done
with
a
style
that
is
often
neglected
taste
is
very
fresh
the
wheat
is
light
and
has
some
grainy
notes
the
yeast
is
most
dominant
in
the
beer
giving
banana
lemon
and
some
pineapple
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
aftertaste
is
light
and
crisp
moderate
carbonation
but
body
quite
light
slips
away
fairly
quickly
gives
the
impression
of
a
creaming
soda
or
similar
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
a
bubbly
pale
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
down
in
short
order
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
not
much
hops
noticable
schneider
weisse
kristall
sports
a
clean
sweet
taste
with
a
familiar
wheaty
aftertaste
the
beer
is
pretty
heavily
carbonated
and
i
think
this
hinders
drinkability
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
champagne
carbonation
but
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
a
good
warm
weather
beer
but
not
fantastic
bottle
this
one
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
inferior
in
all
ways
to
the
hefe
version
significantly
lighter
than
the
hefe
version
crystal
clear
light
gold
with
plenty
of
efferescence
as
expected
and
a
big
white
head
that
i
had
trouble
controlling
on
the
pour
aroma
was
true
to
style
very
much
like
its
hefe
brother
i
was
expecting
a
somewhat
muted
taste
but
was
very
surprised
as
it
was
full
of
flavour
cleaner
but
less
complex
than
the
mit
hefe
felt
a
bit
lighter
in
the
mouth
but
i
guess
that
is
to
be
expected
very
nice
krystal
would
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
the
style
to
those
unable
to
cope
with
cloudiness
i
really
need
to
try
this
one
again
alongside
its
hefe
brother
poured
a
clear
and
very
bubbly
gold
under
a
1
5
finger
white
head
with
some
body
and
good
staying
power
i
didnt
see
much
lace
though
the
nose
was
strong
with
yeast
and
spice
the
mouth
was
very
prickly
and
light
theres
a
slight
tart
citrus
flavor
accompanied
by
some
coriander
on
top
of
a
good
wheat
and
yeast
base
the
yeast
and
spice
linger
longest
into
the
aftertaste
no
appreciable
hops
but
they
really
arent
needed
i
found
this
brew
surprisingly
yeasty
for
a
kristall
but
pretty
darn
good
nonetheless
overall
i
rate
this
beer
well
because
it
is
so
dynamic
this
is
the
beer
you
serve
at
a
classy
party
after
the
main
coarse
to
finish
a
good
meal
i
often
never
understood
the
kristall
wheat
style
but
this
is
an
exception
more
to
it
than
most
german
kristall
wheats
hints
of
honey
apricot
and
banana
the
best
kristall
wheat
ive
tried
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
hazy
honey
golden
with
a
finebubbled
eggshell
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
wheaty
yeasty
aroma
has
a
strong
citrus
overtone
and
is
quite
inviting
wheaty
flavor
has
a
strong
lemony
note
more
sweet
than
sour
and
a
yeasty
underpinning
overall
it
is
quite
refreshing
perfect
for
a
sweltering
summer
day
fizzy
texture
has
average
body
and
leaves
a
wheaty
and
fairly
tingly
finish
prosit
overall
is
was
a
very
nice
beer
could
see
it
as
a
session
this
one
is
alright
might
be
good
to
finish
off
an
evening
with
or
as
the
only
drink
during
a
fireplace
session
theres
something
soothing
about
this
beer
and
as
such
ive
gotta
give
it
props
pours
a
dirty
opaque
gold
smells
of
banana
and
banana
taste
like
a
tropican
twister
the
banana
one
got
a
lipsmackin
sticky
taste
feel
to
it
which
is
kinda
nice
cloves
in
the
tail
mild
carbonation
nice
change
from
the
heavies
ive
been
drinking
i
see
on
the
label
that
it
says
produced
on
04
06
april
06
or
june
04
i
doubt
the
latter
as
this
tastes
reasonably
fresh
to
me
the
flavor
of
this
brew
was
outstanding
as
well
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
in
the
front
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finnish
that
was
excentuated
by
the
great
carbonation
of
the
beer
a
wonderful
drink
for
sure
very
recommended
this
ones
a
keeper
much
like

theres
not
much
here
to
criticize

it
doesnt
stand

is
about

i
expected

and

made
that
said
i
still
greatly
prefer

masterpieces
brewed

aying
this

is

wise
its
a
winner
as
well
much
sweeter
than
anticipated
with
a
strong
honey
character
a
little
grainy
and
some
yeast
is
in
effect
as
well
think
subdued
heffe
slightly
metallic
and
ends
on
a
sweet
note
vanilla
not
a
great
beer
but
good
clean
and
crisp
enough
flavor
to
fit
the
bill
not
bad
i
was
actually
surprised
that
this
turned
out
to
be
a
nicely
flavored
beer
in
germany
the
kristallklar
weizens
are
the
ones
generally
served
with
a
lemon
nice
trust
me
you
do
not
need
lemon
with
this
one
another
fine
hackerpschorr
bier
refreshing

its
no
weihenstephaner
but
what
is
this
weiss
beer
poured
a
clear
goldenamber
color
with
creamy
slightly
offwhite
foam
that
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
wheat
floral
hops
and
bread
the
taste
was
a
very
lightly
sweet
biscuity
malt
with
light
floral
hops
with
notes
of
grain
and
a
delicate
toasted
banana
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
mediumlow
carbonation
feel
there
was
a
nice
lingering
aftertaste
this
was
a
nice
weiss
and
very
drinkable
it
had
also
held
up
remarkably
beyond
its
expiration
date
crystal
clear
light
straw
color
streams
of
carbonation
make
their
way
to
the

quite

a

sits
on

the
aroma
is
really
big
on
the
vanilla
banana
esters
and
clove
are
present
to
a

degree
the
taste
takes
the
cue
from
the

but
its
a

more
balanced
vanilla

a
really
solid
wheat
beer
and
quite
nice
for
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
pours
golden
and
99
clear
the
head
is
white
and
fluffy
like
whipped
egg
whites
that
settles
very
slowly
leaving
faint
hints
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
really
good
and
notably
sweet
and
fruity
malt
the
hops
are
subtle
and
spicy
the
taste
is
a
sweetdry
that
is
tart
and
sweet
and
the
same
time
the
hops
are
mid
level
for
bitterness
and
have
a
presence
in
the
finish
that
starts
with
notes
of
a
midlevel
lemonycitrus
taste
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
while
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
the
corny
smell
and
the
sweetness
are
what
hurt
this
beers
rating
i
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
especially
not
when
there
are
so
many
great
wheat
beers
out
there
clear
golden
color
and
a
bodacious
blooming
beautiful
white
head
nose
is
redolent
of
vanilla
bananas
and
a
touch
of
citrus
extraordinarily
smooth
and
mild
so
much
that
i
doubted
that
i
was
downing
an
ale
full
of
the
flavor
of
a
weizen
but
lacking
some
of
the
texture
i
normally
like
my
weizens
with
the
hefe
but
you
cant
argue
with
a
refreshing
kristall
such
as
this
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
mountainous
head
that
wont
quit
finally
settles
at
about
one
finger
leaving
a
thick
lace
sweet
malty
aroma
with
citrus
and
clove
at
the
forefront
smells
clean
and
refreshing
piney
taste
with
a
sweet
bite
fairly
well
carbonated
with
extremely
small
bubbles
towards
the
middle
the
taste
thins
out
to
be
pretty
bland
very
weak
finish
started
out
strong
but
left
me
very
disappointed
a
beautiful
opaque
gold
color

it
sits
in

the
head
creamy
in

white
in

the
size

with
endless
sheets
of

the
glass
nose
has
aromas
of
citrus

and
dominated
by
the
malt
begins
sweet
the
top
skimpy
in
feel
the
finish
is
mildly
carbonated
the

pleasant
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
lingering
very
refreshing

and

a
great
beer
for
the
end
of
the
workday
treat
purchased
a
bottle
without
examining
the
expiration
date
which
is
long
since
past
and
there
were
black
markings
on
underside
of
bottle
cap
its
not
primo
fresh
but
it
actually
hasnt
been
ruined
either
just
muted
a
bit
despite
this
wheat
beer
being
filtered
it
still
has
some
heft
to
it
dark
golden
almost
copper
colored
fine
head
a
subdued
brew
malts
are
present
and
wheatyeast
characteristics
are
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
will
try
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
and
rereview
im
amazed
that
this
old
sample
was
drinkable
let
alone
enjoyable
weisse
kristall
is
almost
lager
like
in
clarity
only
a
slight
haze
can
be
discerned
the
head
is
not
as
thick
as
that
of
a
hefeweizen
probably
due
to
the
filtering
of
proteins
conducive
to
head
formation
the
expected
german
wheat
yeast
esters
are
there
and
are
comprised
of
banana
clove
and
a
bit
of
bubblegum
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
as
a
result
of
the
filtration
since
residual
proteins
are
quite
important
in
mouthfeel
hop
flavor
is
absent
but
perceived
hop
bitterness
seems
above
the
norm
for
a
weizen
perhaps
due
to
the
lightening
of
body
musty
notes
and
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
are
present
and
akin
to
that
of
an
unfiltered
hefeweizen
finishes
dry
and
estery
man
what
an
odd
beer
weisse
kristall
is
tasty
but
i
prefer
my
german
weizens
unadulterated
a
refreshing
and
lip
smaking
brew
one
of
my
favourites
notes
an
outstanding
kristall
weizen
beer
extremely
flavourful
and
complex
while
remaining
refreshing
and
just
an
overall
pleasure
to
drink
NA
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
german
brew
i
had
never
had
anything
from
bischoff
so
i
had
to
try
it
i
wasnt
disappointed
my
expectations
where
not
met
i
wasnt
really
sure
if
this
was
a
hefe
or
kristall
but
as
it
turns
out
i
bought
this
and
the
hefe
without
even
knowing
it
poured
from
a
capped
green
bottle
a
vibrant
golden
color
with
just
a
tinge
of
murk
and
a
decent
sized
white
head
smell
is
a
bit
strange
in
that
it
has
a
sort
of
husky
grainskunked
character
that
reminds
me
of
a
macro
lager
like
heineken
it
isnt
exactly
unappealing
in
fact
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
it
really
doesnt
smell
like
any
other
example
of
this
style
i
have
encountered
taste
is
lively
with
carbonation
with
a
sickly
sweet
taste
accompanied
by
a
mild
skunked
flavor
traces
of
banana
and
wheat
are
there
but
very
much
masked
by
the
off
flavors
that
are
present
body
is
an
improvement
with
a
good
dosage
of
carbonation
and
a
light
refreshing
crispness
i
have
to
say
that
it
was
difficult
to
finish
this
bottle
i
toyed
with
dumping
it
but
decided
to
let
it
unfold
a
bit
more
it
took
on
some
of
the
characteristics
that
the
hefe
did
but
ended
up
falling
short
in
comparison
a
strange
beer
imo
not
completely
a
waste
but
im
not
gonna
recommend
it
cheers
drinkable
yes
but
i
dont
know
if
it
makes
me
want
another
something
nice
to
try
but
i
love
yeast
and
all
the
vitamins
that
come
with
it
so
i
would
pass
on
this
one
again
but
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
drinkability
i
will
certainly
be
trying
another
one
of
these
beers
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
the
brew
tastes
quite
light
a
little
lemony
and
it
has
a
bitter
finish
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
sustenance
here
but
is
quite
refreshing
this
was
my
first
taste
of
a
kristall
weizen
and
its
possible
that
i
just
dont
enjoy
the
style
however
as
a
big
fan
of
hefe
weizen
i
will
not
accept
this
after
trying
only
one
example
of
the
style
quite
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
though
lacks
the
real
punch
of
a
true
wheat
beer
this
beer
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
like
a
pilsner
with
a
touch
of
wheat
and
some
sour
honey
tastes
like
a
crisp
pilsner
with
a
touch
of
smoky
skunkiness
there
is
only
a
hint
of
wheat
detected
as
well
finishes
dry
the
mouth
feel
is
light
with
a
medium
carbonation
im
not
impressed
tastes
like
a
deutsch
attempt
at
an
american
macro
lager
but
the
bottle
says
kristall
weizen

i
suppose
every
german
beer
cant
be
amazing
