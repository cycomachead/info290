overall
not

for
what
it
is
does
not
try

so
theres
not
too
much
to
mess
up
i
tasted
it
id
taste
it
again
if
and
only
if
your
pointed
a
loaded
pistol
at
me
while
i
was
dying
of
thirst
and
promised
me
a
youngs
to
wash
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
that
said
i
rated
this
among
its
low
alcohol
peers
sharps
is
a
decent
quality
beverage
its
appearance
is
somewhat
light
as
is
the
taste
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
any
remarkable
qualities
its
aroma
is
that
of
a
typical
american
lager
again
on
the
lighter
side
its
slightly
above
average
and
makes
what
i
like
to
call
a
good
utility
beer
good
after
mowing
the
grass
while
out
on
a
boat
or
watching
kids
its
a
thin
beer
that
could
use
more
grain
flavor
overall
a
malt
beverage
with
the
emphasis
on
malt
i
was
hoping
it
would
at
least
have
the
miller
high
life
amount
of
hops
but
actually
closer
to
an
ab
natural
light
na
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
before
i
tried
it
but
this
is
exactly
what
an
na
should
be
its
delicious
this
tastes
like
an
illbegotten
dessert
the
sweet
bread
flavor
is
not
welcomed
almost
like
unfinished
pizza
dough
if
it
werent
for
my
curiosity
i
wouldnt
have
bought
this
and
i
wont
buy
it
again
it
pours
out
a
pale
uricyellow
with
a
filmy
head
thats
gone
in
an
instant
scent
of
fieldrice
paddy
muted
malt

like
if
you
were
to
add
more
water

a
stadium

tastelessbut
fizzy
carbonation
leaves
no
aftertaste
whatsoever
there
are
many
better
non
alchoholic
choices
this
is
a
good
place
to
go
if
you
ever
need
a
lowalcohol
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainyricy
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
mostly
watery
not
much
going
on
here
light
body
not
drinkable
just
had
to
try
this
one
at
my
father
in
laws
you
will
frequently
find
these
na
beers
and
in
fact
i
have
traded
for
a
few
to
give
him
new
choices
this
one
was
just
soo
off
though
it
was
not
even
funny
pale
golden
and
fizzy
light
yellow
with
a
relatively
absent
aroma
that
only
slightly
gave
a
light
corn
and
grain
mix
flavor
again
was
like
carbonated
water
with
a
oxidized
after
taste
overall
one
of
the
lightest
tasting
and
pracically
non
existent
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
know
that
i
would
let
a
stray
dog
drink
this
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
sample
again
pours
a
sickly
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
and
a
complete
lack
of
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
grain
and
general
dead
things
tastes
like
sweet
corn
with
okra
and
some
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
with
too
much
carbonation
drinkability
was
high
because
it
has
no
alcohol
so
go
for
it
this
began
much
better
than
pabst
na
with
nothing
going
crazy
when
i
cracked
open
the
can
it
poured
with
a
finger
of
bone
white
head
that
made
like
houdini
and
disappeared
before
my
very
eyes
magic
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
strangely
vegetablelike
reminiscent
of
farmers
market
while
in
season
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
encountered
anything
like
this
in
a
beer
mouthfeel
was
thin
approaching
medium
with
a
slight
bitter
bite
and
lots
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
man
i
cannot
get
past
the
smell
every
time
i
lift
the
glass
near
my
nose
the
worst
part
is
that
the
beer
does
not
taste
like
it
smells
how
did
they
achieve
this
finish
was
slightly
bitter
kind
of
tasty
not
bad
actually
still
it
is
not
going
into
my
cooler
any
time
soon
reviewed
from
notes
had
this
while
visiting
a
friend
of
mine
adecided
to
give
it
a
try
extremely
pale
color
with
a
small
white
head
which
fades
quickly
i
detect
some
corn
in
the
aroma
not
much
else
has
a
corn
cereal
taste
which
is
unpleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
light
as
expected
and
there
is
not
much
of
a
reason
to
try
this
again
i
had
it
this
time
out
of
curiosity
overall
the
same
thing
you
would
expect
from
a
macro
just
not
filling
in
the
least
lets
be
honest
you
knew
what
this
beer
was
when
you
picked
it
up
for
one
its
miller
and
secondly
its
na
there
are
decent
ones
out
there
but
this
one
is
just
well
what
you
would
expect
so
disappointing
need
i
go
on
about
the
mouthfeelwateryesque
nature
tastes
very
watery
has
very
little
flavor
to
report
no
reason
really
to
drink
this
there
are
other
nonalcoholiclow
alcohol
beers
that
are
much
better
than
this
one
even
odouls
beats
this
hands
down
this
beer
was
reviewed
while
on
holiday
in
tobago
and
almost
ruined
the
whole
two
weeks
very
malty
in
the
aroma
stakes
and
a
headless
lager
look
about
it
it
is
a
malted
barley
watery
nasty
miller
sharps
is
exhibit
a
is
what
is
wrong
with
low
alcohol
beer
i
cant
believe
that
in
this
day
and
age
breweries
cant
come
up
with
a
process
that
results
is
something
better
than
this
of
course
having
tasted
a
good
portion
of
millers
lineup
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
so
surprised
this
looks
like
your
typical
macro
lager
and
smells
like
one
as
well
meaning
not
much
aroma
period
other
than
some
malt
adjuncts
if
you
try
really
hard
if
theyre
gonna
do
an
na
beer
why
not
bring
something
to
the
table
like
hops
anyways
this
actually
has
more
flavor
than
bud
light
which
is
really
sad
you
could
drink
and
endless
amount
of
these
but
why
would
you
if
potable
water
is
readily
available
perhaps
it
is
indeed
impossible
to
make
good
beer
without
alcohol
which
is
a
shame
thirsty
and
dont
want
any
alcohol
drink
water
bad
tap
water
tastes
better
than
this
swill
surprisingly
good
or
else
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
initial
white
puffy
head
that
was
very
quickly
gone
smell
is
grainy
and
not
very
enjoyable
taste
is
more
grainyness
and
the
taste
becomes
less
tolerable
as
the
beer
warms
finishes
with
a
slightly
unpleasant
taste
not
very
good
it
would
make
a
competent
american
macro
lager
if
it
had
an
alcohol
content
but
since
it
doesnt
i
wont
come
back
there
are
better
near
beers
out
there
for
shits
and
giggles
i
borrowed
one
from
a
friend
watching
the
seahawks
game
on
championship
sunday
apparently
a
recovering
alcoholic
he
brought
near
beer
i
dont
know
about
you
but
without
the
alcohol
it
loses
its
luster
to
drink
beer
that
tastes
like
crap
and
has
no
warming
effect
is
pointless
if
you
must
drink
na
find
one
other
than
this
light
transparent
strawlike
color
with
an
unending
parade
of
small
bubbles
this
brew
looks
like
an
average
everyday
macro
the
head
is
shallow
and
fleeting
the
aroma
is
faint
and
of
cereal
grains
no
hop
presence
at
all
the
first
taste
is
actually
a
little
sweet
its
watery
and
hollow
on
the
other
hand
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
na
brews
this
one
has
at
least
some
flavor
and
notable
characteristics
its
not
great
but
it
is
better
than
most
my
first
foray
into
nonalcoholic
beers
sharps
was
among
the
cheapest
the
beer
is
a
very
light
platinum
and
the
head
is
larger
and
more
lasting
than
any
other
massproduced
american
beer
i
can
think
of
alcohol
or
no
its
the
typical
smell
too
with
a
light
vegetable
and
mineral
quality
reminiscent
of
sporting
events
i
was
truly
expecting
the
worst
from
this
beer
but
it
actually
has
some
good
qualities
theres
a
reasonable
amount
of
flavor
and
ill
be
damned
if
it
doesnt
scratch
that
beer
itch
it
washed
down
a
slice
of
pizza
with
aplomb
of
course
sharps
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
if
youre
abstaining
from
alcohol
as
i
am
due
to
painkillers
i
am
taking
for
an
injury
and
are
looking
for
a
bargain
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
in
fact
the
prospect
of
no
alcohol
is
not
as
bleak
as
i
imagined
but
keep
in
mind
its
been
a
while
since
real
beer
has
passed
my
lips
ordered
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
restaurant
just
for
the
hell
of
it
always
wondered
if
it
was
a
good
tasting
beer
really
not
a
bad
idea
beer
with
out
the
tastes
of
alcohol
too
bad
this
na
beer
tastes
nothing
of
beer
pours
a
flat
yellow
macro
color
with
no
smell
to
speak
of
very
weak
the
taste
is
of
water
and
really
nothing
substantial
mouthfeel
is
light
and
putrid
couldnt
even
finish
the
bottle
i
was
drinking
so
obviously
not
a
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
what
was
miller
thinking
do
people
buy
this
this
has
got
to
be
if
not
the
worst
then
pretty
damned
close
the
colour
was
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
little
head
the
smell
was
of
corn
have
you
ever
had
corn
pops
thats
what
it
smells
like
the
taste
was
watery
i
could
say
that
it
had
subtle
hints
of
cascade
hops
and
a
nice
balance
of
malts
but
i
would
be
lying
there
was
little
taste
except
for
corn
and
rice
pours
out
the
lightest
of
straw
yellow
colours
lots
of
big
and
fast
rising
bubbles
keep
a
fairly
white
dense
head
intact
pretty
typical
unappealing
light
adjunct
aroma
in
fact
it
sort
of
stinks
well
there
is
basically
no
taste
i
concur
the
with
the
pevious
reviewers
in
that
it
tastes
like
bad
tap
water
minus
the
carbonation
watery
and
thin
mouthfeel
its
sort
of
drinkable
basically
for
the
fact
that
its
cold
and
wet
this
is
a
bad
carbonated
beverage
dont
bother
notes
hands
down
the
worst
na
beer
in
the
world
a
great
gag
beer

they
should
sell
this
one
in
the
joke
shops
sad
thing
is
that
the
joke
is
on
me
this
time
lets
see
what
should
we
name
a
really
dull
beer
sharps
this
is
the
most
inappropriate
name
for
a
consumer
product
since
the
automobile
nova
translates
to
does
not
go
in
spanish
so
maybe
i
am
stretching
a
bit
but
the
only
reason
is
because
i
really
cannot
find
anything
worth
mentioning
about
this
flacid
nearbeer
weak
color
no
aroma
to
speak
of
has
the
character
of
water
after
passing
through
a
colander
full
of
rice
watery
and
pathetic
finish
on
top
of
all
these
wonderful
attributes
there
is
not
even
any
alcohol
content
which
can
sometimes
be
the
saving
grace
for
even
the
most
putrid
of
beers
many
of
which
are
incidentally
made
by
this
very
same
brewer
if
someone
didnt
leave
one
of
these
in
my
fridge
i
never
would
have
bothered
curiosity
killed
the
cat
in
this
case
not
entirely
hateful
considering
the
style
looks
pretty
much
like
an
average
american
macro
lager
and
smells
about
the
same
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
on
a
par
with
a
macro
but
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
dependent
on
the
weather
and
could
be
used
as
a
thirst
quencher
in
a
pinch
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
modest
head
and
slight
carbonation
actually
the
carbonation
looks
like
it
belongs
with
a
wellmade
microbrew
lots
of
small
slowrising
bubbles
aroma
of
cooked
cereal
and
faint
hops
not
much
else
taste
yields
fairly
sharp
spritzy
carbonation
subdued
maltiness
and
some
watered
down
hops
towards
the
finish
it
would
be
fairly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
think
still
it
is
a
nonalcoholic
beer
from
a
macro
brewer
this
in
my
opinion
limits
the
possibilities
of
such
a
brew
pours
like
a
typical
miller
beer
slight
head
which
goes
away
fast
mild
carbonation
taste
is
of
watered
down
grain
corn
with
only
a
slight
hop
taste
malt
is
there
just
barely
finishes
without
any
distinct
aftertaste
not
bad
for
an
na
brew
if
i
took
to
na
i
might
get
to
like
this
sharps
is
a
tasty
brew
and
i
really
wonder
why
miller
doesnt
go
on
to
make
this
one
with
some
teeth
overall
saw
this
laying
out
as
a
single
and
picked
it
up
out
of
curiosity
as
i
havent
tried
a
na
beer
yet
as
expected
the
flavor
and
body
is
very
light
not
good
but
not
terrible
either
although
if
i
had
to
give
up
booze
i
doubt
i
would
drink
something
like
this
much
what
i
purchased
was
fresh
i
bought
it
cold
and
kept
it
cold
i
had
to
really
take
a
whiff
to
smell
the
malt
no
skunk
here
the
flavor
is
sharp
and
the
malt
lingers
in
the
wash
to
makeup
for
the
absence
of
alcohol
there
are
mineral
overtones
sodium
is
slightly
pronounced
what
i
like
about
it
most
of
all
i
could
tell
the
makers
wanted
to
deliver
a
satisfying
beverage
for
those
of
us
who
cant
drink
alcohol
overall
a
well
crafted
brew
but
has
almost
no
character
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
golden
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
leaving
light
lacing
faint
aroma
of
sweet
malt
not
much
else
light
flavor
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
light
fruit
juice
and
no
noticeable
hops
light
bodied
a
light
but
pleasant
nolow
alcohol
malt
beverage
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
and
the
malt
is
subdued
but
quite
drinkable
im
a
little
surprised
at
other
recent
reviews
how
does
this
compare
to
craft
beer
not
well
but
it
is
sold
as
a
nolow
alcohol
brew
my
ratings
will
be
higher
because
im
reviewing
to
style
not
comparing
to
a
high
abv
craft
beer
that
being
said
ive
enjoyed
the
stronger
malt
flavors
of
other
nolow
malt
beverages
but
this
was
a
nice
low
key
one
overall
if
you
like
light
beers
like
bud
and
coors
light
which
havent
much
flavor
it
would
drink
this
instead
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
the
price
was
a
little
too
steep
for
what
you
get
at
10
99
a
six
pack
this
beer
should
be
outstanding
compared
to
what
you
will
get
for
a
craft
beer
here
in
the
pacific
northwest
o
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
for
being
nonalcoholic
although
it
could
use
some
more
hops
to
lend
bitterness
and
cancel
out
some
of
the
sweetness
the
label
says
to
serve
this
coldand
thats
how
i
consumed
itso
im
not
sure
if
it
would
become
sweeter
after
warming
up
its
quite
drinkable
had
a
six
pack
n
my
basement
left
over
from
during
my
wifes
pregnancy
opened
one
tonight
just
to
give
it
a
try
poured
into
a
small
beer
tasting
glass
bright
orange
color
some
carbonation
but
no
head
or
lacing
smell
was
somewhat
skunky
and
vegetablelike
taste
was
like
malty
apple
juice
no
hops
at
all
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
slightly
similar
to
a
pilsner
slight
bitter
aftertaste
i
have
had
one
other
wretched
low
alcohol
beer
and
this
i
will
admit
was
slightly
better
at
least
this
is
german
putrid
tasting
beer
makes
me
winder
if
toilet
water
would
be
preferable
in
my
glass
pours
golden
with
nice
clarity
but
minimal
head
nose
is
skunky
with
a
cooked
vegetable
character
that
is
appalling
foul
cooked
veggies
on
palate
too
some
rice
maybe
drinkability
kind
of
low
as
far
as
beers
go
again
the
taste
was
close
to
that
of
a
german
pils
but
a
little
fake
tasting
as
far
as
repeat
drinking
since
one
would
have
to
be
drowning
in
the
stuff
to
get
a
buzz
id
say
its
safe
enough
to
go
back
to
a
few
times
d
the
best
near
beer
ive
had
though
i
havent
had
many
this
is
a
low
alcohol
beer
that
could
fool
a
lot
of
people
into
thinking
it
was
a
light
helles
blind
pours
a
macro
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
corn
with
some
malty
sweetness
the
flavor
is
sweet
corn
it
tastes
like
a
very
sweet
macro
lager
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
not
very
good
but
it
is
not
much
worse
than
most
of
the
large
bmc
lagers
even
though
it
is
a
low
alcohol
beer
longneck
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
because
thats
how
i
roll
ever
so
pale
straw
colored
with
an
actually
adorable
white
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
honey
pear
and
some
pleasant
grains
i
like
the
smell
it
just
needs
some
hops
to
balance
it
out
tastes
like
apple
juice
and
a
crisp
mild
bittering
that
gives
it
a
semblance
of
balance
touches
of
grain
no
off
flavors
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
to
low
carbonation
the
carbonation
leaves
quite
fast
after
a
few
agitations
and
it
is
left
being
too
watery
this
is
almost
like
a
beer
soda
which
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
nonalcoholic
beer
after
all
this
is
a
decent
drink
note
ive
enjoyed
paulaner
hefeweizen
oktoberfest
and
munich
lager
but
thomasbrau
nonalcoholic
brew
is
pure
sht
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
though
not
filling
at
all
knowing
that
this
is
an
na
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
was
determined
to
keep
an
open
mind
however
this
beer
still
disappointed
especially
since
i
had
previously
tried
some
very
good
beers
from
this
brewer
color
is
extremely
pale
straw
with
not
much
carbonation
in
the
body
has
a
thin
head
but
leaves
some
specks
of
lacing
smells
of
pale
malts
with
a
touch
of
a
grainy
cereal
twang
that
i
like
the
hops
present
give
off
aromas
of
herbs
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
sizable
dose
of
pale
crackery
malts
that
remind
me
of
a
helles
has
a
bit
of
hops
toward
the
end
that
give
it
an
herbalgrassy
thing
has
a
little
weird
sour
note
in
the
finish
along
with
a
seltzery
wateriness
mouthfeel
is
thin
light
and
with
a
prickly
carbonation
highly
drinkable
and
i
could
see
myself
throwing
these
back
as
some
sort
of
soft
drink
but
without
the
overbearing
sweetness
of
a
soda
i
like
nas
call
me
crazy
my
friends
all
do
but
sometimes
a
low
alcohol
can
be
very
satisfying
pours
a
light
golden
colour
some
foam
but
just
under
decent
for
a
german
na
a
good
clean
taste
but
really
could
be
better
there
are
better
reduced
alcohol
beers
out
there
paulaners
thomasbrau
lost
na
shootout
with
blanks
ii
as
soon
as
i
got
a
whiff
of
it
i
went
through
the
motions
of
evauating
the
rest
of
its
attributes
though
despite
the
fact
that
i
was
repulsed
each
time
i
forced
myself
to
drink
a
mouthful
i
have
a
few
other
german
nas
in
my
cellar
ready
and
waiting
for
future
shootouts
lets
hope
they
have
some
redeeming
qualities
because
this
dreck
has
absolutely
none
at
all
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
eurostyle
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
not
recommended
this
is
a
poor
choice
among
nonalcohol
beers
disappointing
beer
for
me
as
paulaner
is
my
favorite
german
brewery
and
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
winner
buy
some
odouls
instead
and
save
yourself
a
few
bucks
unfortunately
this
one
suffers
from
the
same
problems
that
plague
many
other
beers
of
the
style
lack
of
bite
or
richness
no
hop
bite
weak
finish
general
blandness
etc
plus
an
unappetizing
sickly
sweet
honey
flavor
and
aroma
but
relative
to
other
lowalcohol
beers
its
pretty
good
however
that
expression
in
the
land
of
the
blind
the
one
eyed
man
is
king
comes
to
mind
well
i
likely
wont
be
searching
for
more
na
brew
unless
there
is
a
sleeper
out
there
a
passable
brew
somewhat
better
than
the
macros
being
served
but
without
the
alcohol
some
lace
in
the
glass
transparent
and
light
yellow
smells
like
beer
tastes
like
watery
beer
fizziness
drinkable
dry
aftertaste
little
malt
crisp
appropriate
with
the
meal
for
a
long
night
ahead
if
youre
looking
for
some
sparkling
and
good
tasting
weizen
without
alcohol
you
should
try
the
erdinger
weizen
o
overall
refreshing
but
a
disappointment
for
an
alcohol
free
beer
the
typical
hefeweise
flavours
are
not
standing
out
as
much
as
i
would
have
hoped
the
krombacher
version
of
this
takes
the
cake
by
far
this
is
just
another
typical
na
beer
light
and
clean
and
same
time
lackluster
the
taste
is
good
enough
is
just
like
a
normal
paulaner
the
wheat
flaovur
is
noticed
the
end
is
a
little
bit
different
good
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
when
you
have
to
drive
afterwards
not
watery
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
high
but
i
noted
this
for
the
good
quality
of
taste
notes
for
a
moment
there
this
seems
like
a
real
beer
right
up
to
the
moment
before
it
hits
your
tongue
then
everything
fades
back
into
reality
this
might
be
a
good
beer
substitute
for
someone
on
the
wagon
but
it
has
a
strange
color
to
it
smells
good
faint
banana
with
hints
of
bubble
gum
and
wheat
mouthfeel
is
subpar
for
a
hefeweizen
its
better
than
odools
and
other
nas
there
is
a
beer
flavor
overall
drinkability
horrible
like
a
tea
made
from
cardboard
and
artificial
sweetener
water
doesnt
really
resemble
a
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
color
body
big
white
foamy
head
lastingish
grainy
aroma
strong
maybe
corn
corn
taste
very
grainy
mineraly
strong
taste
fizzy
not
a
very
good
aftertaste
dont
think
id
try
again
but
compared
to
becks
better
delicate
noble
hops
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
funky
vegetal
undertone
glowing
golden
beer
holds
a
few
streams
of
briskly
rising
bubbles
short
bright
white
head
fades
to
a
scattered
film
a
few
islands
of
lace
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
body
is
moderately
light
and
mouthfeel
is
clean
herbal
hops
are
overrun
by
a
strong
flavor
that
tastes
like
a
combination
of
cream
of
corn
and
steamed
vegetables
the
beer
is
not
brewed
with
corn
and
its
good
for
another
10
months
so
i
dont
know
what
the
problem
is
i
expected
a
helles
with
less
body
and
malt
flavor
but
what
i
got
was
a
corny
mess
i
cant
imagine
why
they
would
even
sell
this
beer
who
the
hell
would
drink
this
fine
carbonation
gives
this
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
pretty
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
for
an
na
as
well
the
lack
of
overt
sweetness
keeps
this
drinkable
i
would
not
rush
out
and
get
this
but
if
i
had
to
drink
an
na
this
would
be
up
there
with
the
other
german
nas
in
quality
i
guess
the
fact
that
they
have
been
doing
them
longer
gives
them
an
edge
over
the
other
nas
the
smell
is
dominated
by
corn
syrup
with
just
a
touch
of
schpoonk
the
corn
syrup
front
is
followed
by
a
thin
middle
that
starts
to
turn
slightly
sour
strange
the
sourness
follows
through
to
the
finish
where
a
slight
chemical
note
creeps
in
some
grain
and
corn
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
good
na
but
there
are
several
i
like
better
crystalclear
medium
golden
color
the
head
is
small
and
snowwhite
there
is
an
abundance
of
carbonation
with
really
good
lace
the
unfermented
wort
notes
dominate
aroma
there
are
also
some
slight
hops
taste
begins
with
sharp
carbonation
then
sweet
honeylike
malt
notes
which
fade
into
mild
hop
bitterness
finish
is
dry
crisp
and
clean
the
mouth
feel
is
pleasant
although
not
exceptional
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
na
beers
that
i
have
sampled
one
of
the
most
unique
colors
ive
ever
seen
in
a
beer
you
can
see
as
youre
pouring
it
that
its
very
light
and
yet
it
has
a
bronze
cast
to
it
in
the
glass
the
bright
white
head
cannot
hold
and
quickly
drops
to
a
limited
collar
it
does
however
leave
some
spotty
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
has
the
grainy
malt
aroma
of
most
nonalcohol
beers
but
also
includes
a
richer
note
maybe
a
touch
of
munich
malt
the
body
is
thin
and
when
coupled
with
a
light
but
very
fine
carbonation
level
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
crisp
the
flavor
is
very
onesided
with
just
a
dryly
grainy
maltiness
and
lightly
herbal
hoppiness
it
finishes
dry
with
a
light
bitterness
and
a
lingering
grainy
flavor
a
very
unique
na
that
id
surely
rank
within
the
top
5
alongside
guinness
kaliber
and
anheiseurbuschs
odouls
o
has
a
decent
taste
profile
interesting
concept
not
as
spicy
as
i
had
expected
no
wort
flavours
either
one
of
the
better
lowalcohol

appearance
is
not
bad
it
looks
comparable
to
a
pale
lager
golden
clear
actually
a
bit
darker
golden
than
quite
a
few
pale
lagers
head
is
soapy
and
vanished
quickly
unfortunately
nose
is
huge
soggy
grains
rotting
grains
and
corn
heavier
than
a
regular
pale
lager
sweet
nasty
hop
oil
this
smells
like
an
upped
pale
lager
actually
which
is
not
a
good
thing
taste
is
like
low
quality
ice
tea
with
slight
soggy
grains
cornflakes
cheap
oily
honey
quite
a
bit
of
olive
oil
actually
odd
sweet
synthetic
and
plastic
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
less
carb
watery
olive
oil
body
well
if
you
are
looking
for
a
na
jupiler
which
is
obviously
what
you
want
when
you
are
buying
this
this
is
actually
not
that
bad
tourtel
is
a
better
na
that
i
have
tried
i
have
tried
very
little
nas
compared
to
pretty
much
any
beer
every
other
nonalcoholic
drink
this
is
frankly
nasty
to
say
the
least
given
that
it
more
or
less
lives
up
to
the
promises
i
cannot
really
give
it
a
lower
score
than
i
did
even
if
i
do
feel
it
a
bit
like
that
pale
gold
color
but
virtually
no
nose
except
a
little
sugar
oxidation
slightly
sticky
which
is
strange
for
a
lager
little
or
no
taste
just
a
grain
and
water
with
a
touch
of
sugar
makes
the
rather
strong
unpleasant
drink
the
finish
is
weak
or
virtually
nonexistent
and
it
leaves
a
bit
like
the
pearl
sugar
on
the
tongue
simply
disgusting
oooohhhh
this
is
truly
painful
got
this
can
from
a
corner
shop
across
the
way
from
the
train
station
in
schaerbeek
brussels
belgium
yesterday
poured
with
a
soap
bubbly
kind
of
offwhite
head
and
a
little
lace
the
color
isnt
so
bad
pretty
tough
to
muck
that
up
clear
yellow
with
no
rising
bubbles
aroma
was
wretched
meat
processing
plant
mixed
with
old
cabbage
i
should
get
the
silver
star
for
tasting
it
as
in
many
cases
like
this
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
bad
as
the
smell
hahahahaha
still
way
sucked
sweet
with
wet
paper
some
funky
bitter
thang
two
day
hangover
with
liver
cheese
and
cadavers
in
my
mouth
dont
ask
most
redundant
question
of
the
year
is
it
a
session
beer
hahahahaha
if
youre
a
grand
inquisitor
in
the
inquistion
and
asking
a
queree
if
they
would
like
a
little
something
to
wet
their
whistle
rack
please
my
god
i
hadnt
even
realised
it
was
na
when
purchased
this
is
the
most
lamentable
day
for
me
review
translated
from
french

watery
body
as
expected
better
than
most
full
strength
macro
overall
this
is
easily
the
best
low
alcohol
beer
i
have
had
i
just
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
better
3
75
overall
excellent
for
a
low
abv
but
a
little
disappointing
once
you
notice
that
theres
no
body
to
back
up
the
strong
hops
still
this
is
a
brave
attempt
at
making
a
tasty
low
abv
brew
and
certainly
the
first
one
ive
ever
tried
that
has
anything
close
to
real
hop
flavour
an
added
bonus
is
that
the
beer
isnt
too
sweet
which
is
a
major
flaw
of
many
low
abv
beers
this
will
certainly
be
a
regular
low
abv
beer
for
me
although
the
cost
is
rather
high
compared
to
some
of
the
competition
at
least
in
finland
this
brew
is
highly
underrated
it
should
define
a
new
category
0
5
abv
and
needs
to
be
scored
respective
of
that
pours
a
solid
brown
with
lots
of
chunky
lacing
where
it
lacks
is
on
head
and
liveliness
but
otherwise
looks
great
nose
is
hoppy
and
id
be
fooled
blind
tastes
great
for
next
to
no
alcohol
great
brew
and
thanks
for
making
this
and
for
opening
a
brewdog
pub
in
london
sorry
that
was
my
first
and
last
nanny
state
i
am
afraid
it
was
quite
watery
given
the
very
low
alcohol
some
malt
presence
would
help
as
well
interesting
as
an
experience
and
good
alternative
to
beer
juice
drinkers
nonalcoholic
this
was
pretty
impressive
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
copper
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
really
good
on
this
very
sticky
and
maintains
a
great
retention
the
smell
has
a
nice
aroma
of
malts
and
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
and
hoppy
also
the
flavors
are
quite
nice
for
a
beer
with
a
low
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
overall
the
beer
is
good
i
would
easily
say
this
is
the
best
low
abv
beer
ive
ever
had
1001
beers
blog
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
i
like
weird
experiments
like
this
in
the
beer
world
drinking
this
will
never
let
you
take
for
granted
the
role
malt
plays
even
in
the
most
unbalanced
of
west
coast
ipas
for
low
alcohol
beer
though
this
kicks
the
crap
out
of
odouls
not
all
experiments
turn
out
for
the
best
but
i
must
say
i
did
like
nanny
state
the
beer
not
the
group
of
people
made
of
ignorant
control
freaks
if
i
needed
to
quit
drinking
this
would
be
a
great
step
to
get
there
or
would
it
well
its
a
good
stab
at
a
low
alcohol
beer
it
will
end
up
damned
with
faint
praise
but
i
doubt
theres
another
lowabv
brew
out
there
with
so
much
hop
character
it
looks
great
and
smells
nice
but
falls
down
hard
with
the
flavour
and
mouthfeel
bonus
points
for
effort
alcoholfree
beer
doesnt
get
much
attention
over
here
worth
trying
once
overall
probably
the
most
drinkable
na
beer
i
ever
tasted
and
definitely
more
enjoyable
to
drink
than
a
generic
watery
alcohol
containing
lager
would
not
feel
ashamed
in
bringing
this
to
a
party
or
event
keep
up
the
good
work
bd
yes
officer
i
have
been
drinking
tonight
as
a
matter
a
fact
i
have
a
fuck
of
a
lot
to
drink
tonight
i
think
12
beers
but
i
cant
remember
yes
i
will
take
a
breathalyzer
and
a
blood
test
yes
my
breath
does
smell
like
hops
no
your
machines
arent
broken
i
forgot
to
mention
the
beers
i
was
drinking
are
0
5
alcohol
by
volume
notes
polemic
aside
it
is
actually
a
rather
quaffable
brew
full
of
hoppy
flavor
so
it
is
not
for
all
palates
but
it
has
a
fun
edge
to
it
i
would
not
mind
to
have
a
few
of
these
around
funny
how
well
im
told
this
is
selling
in
some
places
for
people
looking
for
the
hops
without
the
alcohol
i
am
very
grateful
that
it
was
available
by
the
bottle
at
the
new
brewdog
bar
in
edinburgh
in
the
cowgait
i
would
be
very
interested
to
know
what
the
ibu
count
on
this
beer
is
probably
not
too
high
but
it
seems
very
bitter
thanks
to
there
being
bugger
all
malt
for
balance
not
a
bad
shot
at
a
very
low
abv
boy
but
i
wont
go
again
this
beer
is
evidence
that
a
sense
of
humour
and
clever
marketing
do
not
equal
good
beer
under
the
circumstances
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
this
is
the
same
as
saying
that
girls
a
pretty
good
ballet
dancer
considering
she
hasnt
got
any
legs
o
this
is
my
second
nanny
state
and
i
can
say
that
drinking
from
the
bottle
may
amelioratehide
the
taste
but
precludes
this
beers
best
feature
the
smell
still
it
has
redeeming
features
and
its
low
abv
can
even
be
considered
a
virtue
in
some
situations
and
i
would
have
another
if
the
circumstance
warranted
very
nice
with
spicy
food
only
recommended
for
novelty
value
this
would
work
for
the
days
you
really
want
hops
but
not
alcohol
but
compared
to
other
ipas
this
does
not
make
it
a
really
interesting
beer
and
something
completely
out
of
the
ordinary
a
tasty
beer
and
well
worth
trying
even
if
only
for
the
novelty
interesting
experiment

not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
but
ill
drink
it
anyway
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
reddishamber
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
aroma
is
grassy
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
grapefruit
hops
and
some
bready
malt
unfortunately
the
taste
isnt
as
nice
as
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
bitter
grassy
hops
but
not
much
else
the
bitterness
isnt
exactly
nice
but
for
a
beer
that
has
just
0
5
abv
at
least
it
does
have
some
taste
to
it
moutheelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
little
bit
slick
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
it
was
nice
to
try
this
brew
and
would
try
it
again
if
i
had
a
chance
to
i
like
the
creativity
here
from
brewdog
but
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
once
well
if
you
want
a
nearzero
abv
and
want
hops
this
is
probably
as
good
as
it
gets
that
does
not
mean
its
good
but
in
terms
of
the
beer
i
really
expected
nothing
at
all
having
heard
the
stramash
a
year
ago
about
the
immature
reaction
in
releasing
this
beer
and
the
fact
that
this
was
a
toned
down
version
i
expected
something
totally
forgettable
but
it
was
a
real
surprise
a
thin
rust
brown
colour
this
beer
impressed
with
its
hop
presence
and
gave
the
impression
of
being
a
much
stronger
beer
i
will
need
to
give
nanny
state
another
go
as
im
judging
not
just
on
memory
notes
but
on
two
separate
2
oz
samples
as
though
i
was
ticking
for
scotland
and
that
just
wont
do
still
from
my
meagre
4
ozs
this
was
very
good
for
what
it
is
just
wish
i
tried
the
original
1
1
200ibus
when
it
was
avaialable
as
a
dare
of
course
unbalanced
pretty
weird
pretty
fun
this
review
considers
the
05
abv
version
i
like
the
appearance
of
it
aswell
as
the
smell
think
hop
juice
lots
of
tropical
fruits
citrus
even
a
hint
of
licorice
the
fun
ends
here
the
taste
i
pure
hops
a
light
bitter
liquid
that
leave
a
long
aftertaste
thats
it
really
i
think
it
needs
a
bigger
body
and
a
bit
more
malt
to
be
enjoyable
but
its
certainly
very
interesting
for
a
beer
with
05
alcohol
in
it
rusty
brick
red
with
an
amazing
head
the
kind
that
rises
an
inch
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
retains
very
well
there
is
a
lovely
fullon
ipa
nose
with
pine
lemon
lemongrass
pineapple
and
orange
blossom
syrup
and
a
wholewheat
bread
aroma
i
get
some
lemon
as
well
the
flavor
echoes
the
aroma
but
the
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
up
to
scratch
weirdly
thin
and
watery
which
does
no
favors
to
the
toasty
nutty
tealike
and
hoppy
notes
that
are
all
individually
assertive
but
harmonious
and
balanced
in
tandem
like
a
good
jazz
band
defanged
brandy
red
and
black
tea
toast
and
citrus
are
key
flavors
i
must
say
the
body
here
is
generally
too
thin
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
an
excellent
beer
and
a
perfectly
drinkable
quaffer
mouthfeel
is
as
expected
quite
watery
and
just
a
little
bit
creamier
than
carbonated
mineral
water
d
i
had
it
yesterday
with
some
friends
and
one
of
them
called
it
hoppy
water
i
cant
find
any
other
way
to
describe
it
besides
the
fact
that
it
looks
great
its
got
a
bold
nose
lots
of
great
flavor
and
a
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
the
only
real
beef
i
have
is
that
it
is
a
little
astringent
on
the
finish
but
that
is
also
a
product
of
its
bitterness
this
brew
may
not
be
as
big
and
bad
as
some
other
ipas
be
as
balanced
as
some
or
have
the
flavors
that
the
alcohol
contributes
but
as
an
attempt
at
reverse
extreme
brewing
for
lack
of
a
better
term
but
really
not
something
to
get
excited
about
by
far
my
least
favourite
brewdog
beer

if
i
judge
this
for
what
it
is
o
tastes
just
like
i
remember
shandy
tasting
when
i
first
sampled
it
in
the
uk
in
the
early
2000s
and
it
is
not
really
distinguishable
from
the
versions
that
contain
alcohol
refreshing
on
a
hot
afternoon
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
rush
out
to
grab
again
the
amount
of
sediment
in
suspension
is
really
unattractive
in
this
brew
makes
me
wonder
how
long
this
was
sitting
on
the
shelf
lemon
tonic
water
aroma
slight
sweetness
of
lemonade
authentic
lemon
juice
citrus
flavor
mildly
sweet
with
a
pale
malt
aftertaste
and
lingering
lemon
peel
bitterness
somewhat
prickly
carbonation
without
feeling
gassy
or
fizzy
overall
very
traditional
without
any
artificial
impression
probably
would
work
well
as
a
mixer
as
an
alternative
to
lemon
soda
its
quite
ok
not
as
a
beer
or
a
shandy
this
is
pretty
bad
even
for
soda
standards
the
beer
pours
an
orangishamber
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
ginger
and
lemons
smelling
about
like
lipton
lemon
tea
smells
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
lemon
with
some
ginger
notes
as
expected
there
is
no
alcohol
or
hop
presence
thin
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
this
is
not
real
similar
to
a
beer
but
it
is
easy
drinking
and
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
for
a
thirst
quencher
this
would
be
a
good
choice
who
reads
a
review
of
kaliber
when
compared
to
other
na
beers
this
is
tops
so
far
its
as
close
to
real
beer
as
i
can
find
my
wife
cant
have
alcohol
in
the
house
so
this
hits
the
spot
when
im
in
the
mood
and
dont
want
to
head
to
the
bar
as
a
recovering
alcoholic
its
tough
to
get
a
decent
na
beer
in
my
area
i
had
the
displeasure
of
having
clausthaler
previously
and
almost
quit
searching
for
other
na
beers
kaliber
unlike
clausthaler
does
not
have
that
super
disgusting
metallic
bitter
finishing
after
taste
more
so
kaliber
is
kind
of
sweet
to
a
degree
with
the
malty
yeast
almost
honey
notes
on
the
forefront
of
the
taste
mouth
feel
is
flat
and
liquid
but
just
having
a
na
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
your
back
yard
fence
is
an
achievement
in
itself
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
ice
cold
like
it
suggested
ill
gladly
continue
drinking
kaliber
until
i
can
find
one
of
those
tastier
na
hefes
wits
or
ipas
o
i
tried
kaliber
basically
for
the
sake
of
trying
a
low
alcohol
beer
i
dont
dismiss
anything
out
of
hand
na
beers
are
unpopular
for
a
reason
and
not
just
for
the
reason
that
it
wont
get
you
drunk

is
a

pours
a
medium

color
with
a
about
a
12
finger
of
a
foamy
offwhite
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
stewed
grains
for
the
most
part
the
taste
actually
has
more
going
on
that
the
aroma
suggests
and
is
of
grains
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
with
a
slight
dry
finish
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
but
not
bad
actually
didnt
know
this
was
a
near
beer
brew
like
odells
as
i
have
never
seen
it
before
and
was
sold
in
another
section
overall
not
my
style
or
likes
not
because
it
is
a
near
beer
but
because
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
o
i
poured
this
one
out
pretty
fast
lots
of
tea
and
vegetables
and
neither
in
a
good
way
whew
one
of
the
worst
ive
ever
had
best
tasting
na
beer
i
have
had
so
far
way
better
than
o
dools
and
st
pauls
my
dad
who
likes
guinness
tried
it
and
like
it
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
it
is
a
good
malt
beer
highly
recommended
they
need
to
make
more
na
malt
beers
like
this
this
is
an
amazing
beer
not
very
wonderful
i
know
alcoholfree
beer
is
there
to
meet
a
specific
need
but
this
is
just
gross
looks
decent
this
is
the
best
thing
about
it
the
aroma
and
flavour
consist
primarily
of
sweetish
stewedgrain
and
a
hint
of
cabbage
water
watery
body
lacking
in
substance
and
character
if
i
needed
to
avoid
alcohol
i
dont
think
i
would
choose
this
give
it
a
miss
from
notes
imma
gonna
have
another
now
low
c
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
has
some
apple
juice
like
character
given
what
this
is
it
seems
a
good
example
of
nonalcoholic
beer
however
it
lacks
most
of
what
i
personally
seek
from
the
experience
of
drinking
beer
o
the
beer
looks
impressive
when
poured
but
after
that
its
all
downhill
i
wouldnt
try
this
again
as
there
are
other
low
alcohol
beers
that
are
much
more
palatable
than
this
this
is
very
fizzy
it
almost
has
the
body
of
seltzer
water
with
how
light
and
fizzy
it
is
it
goes
down
so
quickly
it
takes
more
sips
than
usual
to
get
at
the
flavors
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
nice
medium
to
dark
orange
amber
thin
head
but
some
spotty
lacing
faint
aroma
of
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
light
grain
i
like
the
malt
flavor
in
this
and
would
consider
this
any
time
i
wanted
a
nolow
alcohol
beer
o
not
really
sure
how
this
compares
to
other
nas
but
it
is
extremely
unpleasant
its
rather
hard
to
force
this
swill
down
not
good
at
all
might
be
ok
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
but
i
have
not
tried
enough
to
make
a
good
comparison
drain
pour
overall
for
a
near
beer
this
rates
decently
its
flavors
ive
never
experienced
in
a
beer
before
but
to
style
its
on
point
tastes
almost
like
beer
i
would
still
drink
a
light
lager
over
this
though
a
nice
little
near
beer
crisp
light
slightly
sweet
toasted
english
muffin
tasting
brew
another
decent
thirst
quencher
for
the
designated
decoy
write
me
if
you
dont
know
the
jokeor
for
when
you
cant
afford
to
get
buzzed
out
it
is
surprisingly
beery
in
flavour
sort
of
watered
down
version
of
harp
pours
golden
with
big
head
at
first
frothy
but
recedes
to
not
much
aroma
of
sugar
cookies
on
the
nose
quite
prominent
with
some
herbal
sweet
tea
more
sugar
cookies
on
palate
simple
grains
and
light
bodied
more
sweetness
on
finish
seems
targeted
at
the
youthful
drinker
d
maybe
one
of
the
better
nas
out
there
but
not
for
me
ya
know
this
aint
bad
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
certainly
smells
and
tastes
better
than
your
typical
adjunct
lagers
thats
for
sure
poured
a
2
white
head
which
dissipated
completely
clear
straw
yellow
in
color
smell
has
a
little
hint
of
malt
and
grain
but
it
also
has
a
sort
of
soapy
smell
which
turned
the
lady
of
the
house
off
immediately
taste
has
sour
malt
the
body
is
watery
hey
this
has
much
more
flavor
than
the
average
nonalcoholic
beer
and
mind
you
it
does
have
alcohol
5
of
it
but
its
no
more
than
a
shadow
of
real
beer
terrible
dont
know
why
anyone
would
drink
this
if
for
whatever
reason
i
couldnt
drink
alcohol
id
just
choose
another
beverage
this
doesnt
taste
like
beer
d
nice
nonalc
best
ive
had
d
i
need
to
look
harder
at
the
bottles
i
throw
in
my
next
random
pick6
blurgh
overall
a
not
horrible
nonalcohol
alternative
but
id
rather
drink
coke
etc
d
an
solid
low
abv
beer
worth
a
shot
has
a
nice
beer
character
well
this
one
actually
isnt
bad
and
id
take
it
if
i
was
on
some
kind
of
diet
or
for
medical
reasons
of
all
the
non
alcoholic
beers
on
the
market
this
is
the
only
that
is
actually
enjoyable
it
has
a
watered
down
taste
but
i
suppose
thats
part
of
the
whole
point
anyways
if
you
gotta
have
a
few
brews
but
you
cant
drink
the
alcohol
this
is
as
goos
ad
youre
gonna
get
or
if
you
need
a
designated
driver
but
the
dd
wants
to
put
a
few
back
100
times
better
than
odouls
this
is
my
first
near
beer
beer
is
thin
and
watery
kind
of
a
lingering
sweetness
like
a
dilute
kvass
there
is
some
notes
of
caramel
in
the
mouth
but
overall
its
not
pleasant
d
meh
nothing
amazing
but
i
could
see
how
kids
would
want
to
drink
this
to
pretend
that
they
are
actually
drinking
beer
on
the
flip
side
this
is
not
a
good
introduction
to
an
actual
good
beer
330
ml

clear
very
pale
yellow
colour
big
to
moderate
white
head
typical
na
beer
aroma
of
overboiled
vegetables
and
baby
maize
porridge
thin

the
flavour
has
notes
of
overboiled

and
wet

hardly
any

terrible
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
lot
of

drink
good

and
get
a
designated

skip
the
na
stuff
mouthfeel
nothing
desireable
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
on

cob
thin
drinkability
this
probably
comes
closer
to
drinking
water
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
d
all
i
can
say
is
that
im
glad
that
im
not
trying
to
quit
drinking
because
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
guess
its
still
better
than
a
macro
na
beer
drinkability
i
bought
a
sixer
and
this
bottle
sure
left
the
scene
in
a
hurry
im
not
saying
that
id
want
to
drink
it
every
day
but
it
does
make
for
a
good
change
of
pace
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
malt
beverage
this
one
was
one
of
the
better
nas
i
have
had
it
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
little
to
no
head
it
has
a
sweet
quality
to
it
a
malty
grainy
corn
like
flavor
it
is
rather
smooth
tastes
like
a
beer
at
least
when
it
is
cold
has
a
slight
fruity
note
overall
if
i
want
something
fizzy
and
low
alcohol
i
will
go
with
a
soda
thank
you
very
much
light
on
the
palate
with
a
grainy
taste
that
dissipates
in
seconds
a
soda
tastes
a
lot
better
its
trying
to
be
a
harp
i
guess
not
the
worst
na
out
there
but
there
are
better
offerings
d
horrible
stomach
turning
i
poured
it
out
after
two
sips
the
na
in
the
name
might
come
from
the
brewer
writing
na
on
the
sheet
asking
what
type
of
beverage
this
is
the
term
beverage
is
not
applicable
flavor
is
not
great
kaliber
does
not
taste
like
beer
actually
it
isnt
really
beer
because
the
fermentation
once
completed
is
reversed
by
evaporation
tastes
like
extremely
watered
down
bitter
apple
juice
with
fizz
mouthfeel
is
all
bubbles
not
good
d
for
an
na
it
is
a
beer
i
cant
say
i
was
turned
off
by
just
not
something
i
can
honestly
say
is
satisfying
or
drinkable
i
would
probably
take
one
if
it
was
given
since
it
is
pretty
good
for
the
low
alchohol
style
though
honestly
if
its
between
this
or
no
beer
at
all
i
hope
youre
not
too
thirsty
look
for
other
options
in
na
beer
this
beer
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
slowly
settled
to
leave
a
thin
ring
on
the
surface
the
smell
was
surprisingly
good
dry
caramel
and
molasses
malt
aromas
the
taste
was
dry
caramel
and
molasses
with
some
woody
and
grain
notes
and
with
good
aromatic
hops
at
the
finish
not
bad
at
all
for
a
nonalcohol
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
crisp
with
light
body
and
decent
carbonation
the
malty
flavors
and
light
hoppiness
lingered
this
was
a
surprisingly
flavorful
na
beer
and
i
will
look
for
it
when
the
need
arises
of
the
na
beers
that
i
have
tried
thus
far
this
definitely
is
the
best
imagine
a
harp
lager
minus
the
alcohol
and
you
have
kaliber
very
malty
aroma
and
flavor
as
it
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
the
lack
of
alcohol
results
in
it
being
a
bit
over
the
top
in
sweetness
still
this
has
flavor
unlike
the
other
major
american
brands
which
taste
like
lemon
flavored
perrier
di
havent
had
a
lowalcohol
brew
in
several
years
this
one
was
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
awhile
but
it
was
better
than
i
expected
and
easy
to
drink
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
pale
amber
color
with
good
clarity
and
good
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
two
fingers
of
ofwhite
foam
that
became
a
thin
cap
and
left
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
cereal
grains
and
sweet
malt
think
product
19
cereal
the
flavors
were
dry
at
first
and
the
yeast
was
distinctly
similar
to
guinness
then
it
got
sweeter
with
the
cereal
grains
a
hint
of
toasted
malt
and
a
rather
european
taste
like
salt
water
taffy
the
mouthfeel
was
semismooth
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
medium
as
far
as
the
nonalcoholics
go
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
conclusion
since
im
still
on
my
lenten
kick
this
is
sadly
the
only
beer
i
get
to
enjoy
on
st
pattys
day
that
being
said
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
the
only
other
na
beer
ive
tried
to
date
is
odouls
where
odouls
is
very
similar
to
many
light
macro
lagers
but
fairly
lacking
in
flavor
kaliber
has
much
more
flavor
but
its
less
beerish
and
more
fresh
wort
all
in
all
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
pours
a
pretty
clear
orangish
offbrown
color
body
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
funky
aroma
some
maltiness
and
some
funk
berry
aroma
blueberry
strong
ripe
blueberry
pancake
smell
tastes
like
blueberries
very
carbonated
thick
carbonated
taste
soda
water
harsh
light
sweet
taste
better
than
water
maybe
di
thought
i
really
liked
this
at
the
bar
the
other
day
and
it
is
fine
much
better
than
a
sharps
or
odouls
etc
this
has
a
nice
sweeter
flavor
and
if
you
try
real
hard
you
might
be
able
to
convince
yourself
this
has
some
bock
like
notes
overall
though
the
thin
body
and
watery
texture
keeps
this
from
being
a
great
na
decent
not
bad
a
nice
change
up
if
you
dont
want
the
alcohol
but
id
much
prefer
the
becks
na
which
is
actually
very
good
overall
god
forbid
the
human
that
like
this
shit
it
is
not
good
there
is
a
carbonation
mouth
feel
with
little
to
no
finish
except
for
that
funky
note
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
deep
caramel
copper
with
a
2
inch
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
as
the
beer
recedes
the
aroma
is
pretty
vacant
from
the
beer
there
is
just
a
slight
caramel
note
if
you
really
focus
this
beer
is
pretty
void
for
flavor
also
slight
toffee
notes
with
a
club
soda
flavor
intermingled
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
unassuming
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
for
a
na
but
give
me
the
booze
i
think
that
the
process
of
extracting
the
alcohol
really
took
a
lot
out
of
the
beer
judging
by
the
color
i
actually
thought
i
was
in
for
a
treat
notes
overall
it
had
more
beer
flavor
than
i
expected
similar
to
a
weak
watered
down
english
bitter
but
i
still
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
this
bottle
was
left
in
my
fridge
by
my
fatherinlaw
on
his
last
visit
so
i
decided
to
pop
it
and
see
what
it
tasted
like
pours
almost
still
with
no
real
head
light
brownish
amber
smells
like
wasa
crackers
very
crackery
with
rye
and
pumpernickel
aromas
dry
malt
light
tasting
with
some
grainy
sourness
more
of
the
crackery
flavor
and
some
mouthcoating
sweetness
at
the
end
that
is
a
bit
cloying
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
one
i
had
high
hopes
for
kaliber
since
its
brewed
by
the
makers
of
guinness
alas
i
was
disappointed
kaliber
boasts
a
strong
sickly
sweet
aroma
of
wort
kind
of
a
haylike
barnyard
smell
it
tastes
sweet
too
with
hints
of
corn
but
mostly
just
like
sugar
water
with
hay
in
it
in
a
word
gross
drinkability
this
beats
most
low
alcohol
beer
simply
by
providing
something
to
taste
doesnt
exactly
deliver
much
in
the
way
of
beer
flavor
but
you
cant
have
everything
id
pick
this
over
the
other
low
alcohols
ive
tried
a
truly
great
beer
has
a
delicious
flavour
for
a
reduced
alcohol
beer
the
foam
level
is
awesome
lower
on
the
lacing
flavour
is
good
even
fooled
a
friend
thinking
this
was
a
regular
beer
wonderful
on
a
warm
day
when
alcohol
is
not
an
option
very
pale
clearish
orange
amber
color
frothy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
oddly
sweet
malt
smell
kind
of
plasticy
bandaidish
medicinal
sweetness
tastes
like
a
honey
dipped
bandaid
strange
unnatural
and
i
would
rather
have
a
coke
poured
in
a
beer
bottle
if
i
wanted
people
to
think
i
was
drinking
beer
without
drinking
beer
awful
i
cant
believe
the
ratings
are
even
this
high
the
beer
emerges
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
a
limpid
gold
with
a
depleted
semicreamy
white
head
that
evaporates
leaving
a
patchy
coating
of
lace
to
almost
cover
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malted
grain
fresh
and
crisp
to
the
senses
start
lightly
sweet
with
a
decent
grain
presence
top
is
light
in
feel
finish
is
prickly
in
its
acidity
the
hops
present
and
light
as
one
would
expect
quite
dry
aftertaste
a
drinkable
brew
for
its
type
do
to
a
recent
recurring
medical
problem
it
satisfies
my
taste
for
beer
not
the
alcohol
i
just
like
the
taste
besides
how
much
water
and
gatorade
can
one
person
take
lol
d
loads
of
carbonation
when
combined
with
a
nearfreezing
temperature
help
this
one
go
down
easy
easily
the
best
na
that
ive
tried
so
far
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
actually
surprisingly
pretty
good
with
a
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
as
well
and
a
little
better
than
expected
with
some
malt
and
dark
bread
the
taste
is
pretty
faint
and
watery
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
the
one
trait
that
really
detracts
from
the
brew
as
it
is
thin
and
fizzy
like
a
soda
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
decent
for
what
it
is
but
really
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
i
poured
my
bottle
into
a
glass
but
i
think
this
beer
actually
may
be
a
little
better
straight
out
of
the
bottle
this
lowalcohol
beer
promises
but
fails
to
deliver
maybe
because
i
am
so
used
to
fine
imports
and
craft
brews
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
color
is
a
deep
golden
brown
so
it
at
least
looks
like
real
beer
flavor
however
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
it
scarcely
tastes
like
beer
the
flavor
is
thin
and
though
not
nasty
barely
mediocre
it
feels
watery
like
a
light
beer
an
a
for
effort
very
malty
and
light
tastes
more
like
a
beer
themed
refreshment
than
an
actual
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
all
that
said

bewareofpenguinoct

like
soda
light
taste
overall
and
rather
thin
too
qualities
of
malt
to
flavor
not
bad
for
a
na
brew
i
mean
thats
not
saying
much
since
theres
still
no
reason
to
drink
it
overall
a
good
na
beer
a
little
expensive
for
what
it
is
though
better
than
average
for
this
style
but
still
not
too
pleasant
skunky
flat
tasting
had
ok
color
but
if
that
is
the
best
that
i
can
come
up
with
you
might
want
to
pass
on
this
brew
got
one
for
free
for
being
a
designated
driver
and
this
was
my
first
na
beer
the
appearance
was
a
pale
yellow
and
the
smell
was
mostly
rice
good
amount
of
carbonation
though
the
taste
was
mostly
rice
with
some
hints
of
malt
although
it
had
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twinge
to
it
near
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
average
but
overall
it
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
might
be
pours
to
a
generous
head
that
persists
color
is
pale
straw
aroma
is
skunky
and
rubbery
to
the
point
i
almost
gave
up
there
are
some
nice
wortlike
malt
and
noble
hop
aromas
in
there
once
the
skunk
dissipates
in
the
nasal
passages
unlike
most
green
bottle
beers
the
skunk
aroma
does
not
decrease
much
over
time
flavor
is
pretty
good
with
some
sticky
pale
malt
and
noble
hop
flavors
to
make
it
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
slightly
worty
and
not
as
rough
as
other
nas
overall
good
as
nas
go
but
the
mercaptans
in
the
nose
nearly
killed
the
deal
st
pauli
na
is
a
way
better
beer
than
odouls
way
better
taste
way
better
smell
i
would
prefer
a
heavy
beer
but
they
dont
make
na
stout
beers
but
the
most
beer
that
is
close
to
a
stout
is
kaliber
which
is
made
by
guinness
also
there
is
malta
which
is
supposed
be
a
good
beer
overall
no
thank
you
i
shall
pass
o
as
far
as
pale
lagers
go
this
is
better
than
some
of
the
alcoholic
ones
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
to
love
though
but
i
actually
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
overall
im
not
so
impressed
by
this
na
beer
compared
to
the
others
ive
tried
best
by
0913
golden
with
a
central
dome
and
outward
flowing
bone
white
foam
pretty
good
look
for
the
style
examples
ive
seen
smells
of
light
grain
some
dough
some
sweet
bread
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
yeast
character
corn
grain
really
sweet
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
nothing
special
thin
bodied
and
moderate
carb
meh
not
the
worst
not
the
best
ive
had
its
funny
though
im
finding
that
the
na
beers
have
the
knack
of
never
really
seeming
to
skunk
o
this
isnt
one
of
the
greatest
nonalcoholic
beers
but
the
taste
isnt
that
offensive
and
tastes
better
than
some
american
adjunct
lagers
this
may
come
as
a
shock
but
ive
actually
had
worse
beers
than
this
i
cant
say
i
liked
it
but
i
sure
didnt
hate
it
either
the
highs
sure
werent
high
but
the
lows
werent
huge
turnoffs
just
a
pretty
bland
maltapple
soda
basically
its
a
good
change
of
pace
for
lowalcohol
beers
its
a
little
too
chalky
for
me
but
it
is
still
good
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
skunky
could
be
the
dreaded
green
bottle
taste
also
has
some
skunk
to
it
somewhat
sweet
lots
of
grains
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
to
find
this
one
ok
i
admitim
only
reviewing
this
to
tick
a
style
that
i
havent
done
yet
i
would
never
buy
a
sixer
of
this
but
came
across
a
free
single
bottle
so
here
goes
as
soon
as
i
started
pouring
this
into
a
mug
it
was
nothing
but
skunk
and
dank
pot
the
area
around
me
smells
like
bedroom
in
college
taste
is
really
sweet
and
grainy
really
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
this
sweet
but
it
is
with
lots
of
grainy
flavors
slightly
floral
and
no
real
hoppiness
its
actually
not
awful
but
not
really
good
either
hard
to
get
past
the
skunky
aroma
though
so
i
try
not
to
smell
it
as
i
drink
it
mouthfeel
is
like
a
light
lager
meh
i
havent
had
an
na
beer
in
probably
10
years
or
more
and
this
really
isnt
enjoyable
largely
because
theres
no
alcohol
in
it
well
a
negligible
amount
and
it
really
detracts
from
the
flavor
beer
really
does
need
to
have
sort
of
alcohol
qualities
to
give
it
it
some
more
flavor
but
anyways
not
need
to
contemplate
it
this
much
its
a
beer
and
skunky
sweet
grainy
one
at
that
not
good
but
not
horrific
oh
god
the
nose
it
is
unyielding
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
a
nice
onefinger
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainyricy
slightly
malty
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
grainy
little
malt
note
light
body
not
too
bad
but
still
a
shitty
beer
right
off
the
bat
upon
popping
the
cap
i
got
a
whiff
of
either
saaz
or
skunk
either
of
which
is
possible
given
these
green
bottles
my
pour
created
just
better
than
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
fell
like
a
souffle
when
you
bang
the
oven
door
closed
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
given
that
i
could
see
into
the
future
with
it
lots
of
co2
bubbles
were
in
evidence
nose
was
saazlike
not
downright
skunked
so
i
am
erring
on
the
side
of
caution
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
with
a
heavy
metallic
taste
in
the
mouth
this
was
not
skunked
but
neither
was
it
much
good
feh
i
could
taste
saaz
hops
in
the
background
but
the
metallic
flavor
up
front
was
more
than
i
wanted
to
deal
with
finish
left
me
cold
at
best
i
just
could
not
shake
that
metallic
taste
which
seemed
pervasive
from
start
to
finish
im
sorry
todd
had
an
allergic
reaction
and
i
would
not
foist
this
on
anybody
the
pour
was
decent
light
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
tow
inch
fizzy
white
head
decent
retention
as
well
the
aroma
was
lots
of
grainy
malts
light
bready
character
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
flavor
followed
along
nicely
smooth
crisp
clean
not
much
depth
here
but
the
style
really
does
not
require
it
easily
drinkable
and
really
not
that
bad
at
all
for
my
first
low
abv
beer
i
was
not
totally
turned
off
by
it
d
not
at
all
id
rather
drink
an
odouls
amber
or
kaliber
if
alcohol
was
an
issue
which
it
is
not
d
i
would
need
to
be
paid
to
have
another
d
ironically
i
dont
find
this
or
most
other
n
a
beers
to
be
very
drinkable
or
sessionable
i
have
had
my
fair
share
of
n
a
beers
while
serving
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
and
even
then
couldnt
force
more
than
two
down
on
any
given
night
if
i
want
something
really
drinkable
with
no
alcohol
in
it
ill
opt
for
water
d
easy
to
drink
and
sweetnessbitterness
is
well
balanced
not
great
but
not
horrible
either
drinkability
this
stuff
is
just
gross
i
will
never
be
having
this
beer
again
unfortunately
the
sweetness
doesnt
seem
to
be
from
natural
sugar
yeast
or
fermentation
but
saccharin
or
something
what
cracks
me
up
is
that
it
seems
like
it
has
the
heat
of
a
high
abv
beer
strange
its
lite
and
sweet
with
a
mild
sulfur
and
a
sticky
back
mouth
there
is
almost
a
wheaty
aftertaste
to
this
beer
i
need
to
read
my
medication
to
figure
out
how
long
i
have
to
go
wtihout
hte
pills
before
its
safe
to
drink
a
real
beer
d
goes
down
very
easy
especially
if
you
cant
have
the
alcohol
but
want
the
beer
flavor
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
rising
through
a
large
white
head
caps
it
off
popping
the
cap
i
can
smell
the
skunk
right
away
why
must
they
bottle
in
green
bottles
maybe
some
adjunct
grains
in
there
but
its
too
skunked
to
tell
the
body
is
firm
with
a
decent
carbonation
pop
this
is
really
sweet
lots
of
honey
sweetness
almost
cloying
cant
really
tell
this
is
a
beer
this
is
my
first
na
beer
it
may
be
my
last
d
overall
i
would
avoid
drinking
this
one
again
the
taste
is
downright
terrible
d
this
was
certainly
more
drinkable
than
i
had
imagined
and
actually
tastes
pretty
decently
like
a
typical
lager
but
still
i
dont
quite
get
the
point
of
nonalcoholic
beer
quoting
quagmire
from
family
guy
its
like
a
snake
without
venom
itd
just
be
a
belt
currently
on
deployment
in
kuwait
purchased
from
the
px
reefer
only
0
75
cents
a
bottle
no
glass
available
consumed
directly
from
bottle
although
smelling
directly
from
the
bottle
may
not
be
most
fair
i
smell
absolutley
nothing
popping
out
i
give
the
bottle
a
little
shake
nothing
taste
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
im
having
a
hard
time
picking
out
any
distinct
flavors
overall
the
best
i
can
say
is
it
is
not
overpriced
at
75
cents
a
bottle
for
out
here
and
and
na
id
drink
again
if
no
other
choice
otherwise
ill
spend
my
3
quarters
elsewhere
d
not
goodwouldnt
drink
unless
had
too
d
well
considering
how
watery
it
is
it
should
be
drinkable
but
it
somehow
fails
at
this
too
after
a
few
sips
i
just
couldnt
bring
myself
to
choke
the
rest
down
ground
pour
switched
to
iced
tea
since
i
couldnt
stand
to
take
another
taste
of
crappy
beer
d
i
think
it
is
my
favorite
na
like
most
nonalcohol
beers
the
appearance
is
lacking
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
no
lace
it
smelled
of
an
odd
caramel
aroma
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
not
terrible
with
a
decent
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
but
it
lacks
anything
else
mouthfeel
was
a
little
weak
and
a
little
watery
not
a
great
brew
but
i
found
it
better
than
odouls
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
10
2009l29889b
the
pour
is
a
thing
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
puffy
choppy
white
head
the
aroma
is
atypical
na
malts
the
texture
is
watery
overall
it
tastes
rather
flat
and
stale
like
unsweetened
malts
what
do
you
want
for
an
na
d
if
you
make
it
past
the
pepé
le
pew
part
youre
halfway
there
avoid
like
the
plague
regular
st
pauli
girl
will
do
you
much
better
hell
even
water
is
more
tasteful
than
this
dexcellent
na
that
is
better
than
some
light
beers
i
think
this
tastes
better
than
bud
light
etc
best
na
i
have
had
edging
out
the
becks
na
both
are
really
good
for
the
style
biggest
issue
is
this
is
96
calories
most
nas
are
about
half
that
maybe
that
is
why
this
tastes
better
this
was
nothing
special
but
it
might
be
decent
to
cook
with
cheers
dammit
man
i
train
for
a
marathon
and
go
dry
for
a
month
but
figured
some
na
beer
would
get
me
done
this
stuff
had
some
maltyness
to
it
but
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
day
old
ass
im
sorry
i
tried
it
at
a
restaurant
in
the
houston
airport
and
again
in
an
orlando
restaurant
both
times
it
was
horrible
and
i
had
to
force
it
down
not
only
did
i
pour
some
of
it
down
the
drain
i
will
be
throwing
full
bottles
away
i
got
some
of
this
for
free
basically
so
why
not
review
it
well
it
has
trace
amounts
of
alcohol
0
5
it
tastes
like
sweet
wert
but
not
fresh
missing
the
alcohol
bite
swill
to
the
max
but
probably
better
than
the
other
nas
maybe
ill
throw
some
yeast
and
sugar
in
the
rest
of
the
bottles
and
wait
a
bit
overall
one
of
the
better
na
beers
though
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
it
is
well
interpreted
i
liked
this
beer
i
have
had
regular
st
paulie
girl
and
enjoyed
it
n
a
is
a
step
down
it
seems
it
had
a
decent
color
to
it
almost
a
golden
hue
so
it
looked
promising
the
taste
seemed
weak
about
the
same
as
an
american
beer
as
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
had
a
bread
taste
which
was
disturbing
so
the
last
18
of
the
bottle
would
go
down
the
drain
another
thing
was
it
was
filling
so
i
wouldnt
suggest
having
it
with
a
meal
but
it
goes
will
with
hot
dogs
but
on
a
cold
day
it
warms
you
good
i
like
it
as
a
standby
beer
even
though
it
has
its
issues
overall
its
not
bad
best
served
chilled
on
a
chilly
day
drinkability
goes
down
decently
but
a
little
rough
for
a
near
beer
st
pauli
n
a
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
very
thin
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
skunky
with
some
cereal
in
the
background
definitely
some
hop
flavor
in
this
one
more
than
i
expected
this
may
be
the
best
n
a
ive
had
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
not
drinking
it
resembles
beer
more
than
any
other
n
a
s
ive
had
im
not
so
sure
that
this
whole
na
shootout
with
blanks
thing
was
such
a
good
idea
im
sitting
here
with
this
horrible
taste
in
my
mouth
trying
to
come
up
with
synonyms
for
putrid
st
pauli
n
a
even
the
girl
wants
no
part
of
this
dreck
is
atrocious
even
for
a
low
alcohol
product
you
couldnt
pay
me
to
no
wait
you
could
pay
me
to
drink
it
but
id
suggest
winning
the
lottery
before
coming
to
me
with
an
offer
one
of
the
better
na
beers
ive
had
nice
not
a
bad
beer
for
its
style
quite
drinkable
passable
for
a
night
when
i
needed
to
drive
and
stay
out
late
and
not
drink
water
or
something
sugary
some
satisfction
ok
in
all
the
categories
although
not
to
good
an
aroma
mellow
but
also
a
half
year
past
due
from
premiere
gourmet
i
would
drink
it
again
if
someone
else
were
buying
the
beer
or
i
had
to
drive
home
and
there
were
few
other
choices
i
would
probably
pick
it
over
bud
light
it
those
were
only
two
choices
not
drinkable
in
my
opinion
not
real
flavorful
and
without
enough
malt
to
balance
the
bitterness
level
there
are
many
better
nas
out
there

for

less

but
there
is
nothing
beer
about
this
whatsoever
it
leaves
a
harsh
lingering
biting
taste
not
unlike
licking
a
9volt
battery
finishing
the
bottle
was
almost
agonizing

see
no

the
flavor
has
a
similarity
to
roasted
barley
beverages
such
as
postum
cafix
etc
for
reasons
that
should
be
obvious
overall
its
not
beer
folks
it
cant
be
this
tastes
like
the
dark
toxic
runoff
from
willy
wonkas
factory
useful
for
inducing
immediate
onset
diabetes
or
keeping
7yearolds
awake
for
weeks
not
really
fit
for
consumption
overall
take
away
the
mild
harsh
finish
and
youre
left
with
a
decent
malt
d
at
first
i
was
shocked
and
appalled
at
the
supersugary
flavor
but
then
the
more
i
sipped
the
more
i
started
to
enjoy
this
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
desertlike
substance
that
is
best
enjoyed
in
very
small
sips
and
thoroughly
iced
down
the
bottles
that
i
bought
are
about
8oz
and
imo
thats
just
about
enough
i
actually
ended
up
really
enjoying
this
stuff
whatever
it
is
this
would
make
a
very
nice
contribution
to
a
marinade
or
stock
base
used
like
mirin
or
sherry
a
worthwhile
cultural
treat
but
i
couldnt
finish
it
certainly
not
something
i
would
readily
try
again
mouthfeel
borders
on
syrupy
and
the
carbonation
is
thin
honestly
this
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
and
it
started
to
upset
my
stomach
after
only
a
few
sips
i
tried
it
i
did
not
like
it
im
surprised
to
see
this
on
this
site
i
like
to
recommend
this
soda
to
friends
at
mexican
restaurants
and
laugh
at
them
when
they
turn
green
after
the
first
sip
this
is
not
a
beer
and
doesnt
seem
to
fit
with
the
low
abv
beer
category
i
believe
the
up
to
5
abv
is
just
a
side
affect
of
the
process
in
which
this
is
made
not
the
intention
i
bought
my
first
bottle
when
i
was
17
or
so
and
wasnt
carded
as
one
would
be
if
buying
near
beer
at
any
rate
this
is
a
rather
interesting
beverage
that
i
do
not
particularly
care
for
but
do
respect
for
its
uniqueness
i
would
describe
the
entire
experience
from
appearances
to
aromas
to
flavor
as
drinking
watered
down
molasses
this
is
a
hard
one
to
down
if
youre
not
used
to
it
so
its
a
good
thing
that
it
comes
in
a
teeny
tiny
bottle
some
caramel
and
a
general
damp
barley
quality
enter
into
play
too
but
molasses
dominates
the
day
strange
strange
brew
prsaxman
reflection
many
of
the
people
i
work
with
grew
up
drinking
malty
sodas
and
they
recommened
this
one
to
me
to
try
it
smells
good
but
its
way
to
sweet
for
my
taste
21505
after
trying
2
munich
dunkels
id
have
to
say
that
malta
india
is
closest
in
style
to
a
munich
dunkel
words
can
not
explain
the
atrociousness
of
this
drink
pours
like
10w30
smells
like
the
aftermath
of
a
skunk
vomit
war
tastes
like
barnyard
dysentery
discharge
i
cannot
feel
my
mouth
now
not
drinkable
at
all
i
would
rather
drink
a
bucket
of
diarrhea
tried
this
at
lunch
at
a
cuban
restaurant
on
a
recent
visit
to
south
florida
had
never
heard
of
it
but
saw
it
on
the
menu
decided
to
try
it
should
have
known
better
when
the
waitress
brought
out
a
glass
of
ice
with
it
poured
it
over
the
ice
managed
to
drink
about
34
of
it
along
with
liberal
sips
of
water
strange
slightly
sweet
taste
that
lasted
the
rest
of
the
day
absolutely
horrid
interesting
with
its
3
screams
fresh
lemon
grapefruit
o
not
bad
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
has
aspects
of
both
a
pilsner
and
an
american
adjunct
lager
not
sure
i
would
get
it
with
any
regularity
but
it
was
worth
trying
not
much
going
on
here
that
i
can
appreciate
o
quite
refeshing
like
clausthaler
this
could
easily
pass
for
a
decent
pale
euro
lager
cheers
it
was
only
a
buck
so
i
guess
if
for
some
reason
i
need
it
this
is
what
i
would
grab
pretty
easy
drinking
for
the
style
offering
just
enough
body
to
keep
things
interesting
and
nothing
to
detract
carbonation
does
empty
pretty
quickly
however
lending
almost
tea
like
qualities
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
oh
and
i
see
that
im
continuing
my
run
of
ironic
milestone
reviews
number
100
was
corona
light
now
300
is
an
alcoholfree
beer
if
i
was
forced
to
drink
this
i
wouldnt
be
contemplating
suicide
is
that
a
compliment
itll
have
to
do
this
is
the
one
area
where
the
beer
is
fairly
successful
combining
compotent
carbonation
without
going
fizzy
and
finishing
somewhat
thick
in
the
mouth
this
would
be
for
the
designated
driver
who
really
needs
to
feel
like
theyre
drinking
with
the
crowd
not
very
good
but
actually
better
than
a
number
of
massproduced
beers
ive
tried
glad
ive
at
least
tried
a
nonalcoholic
though
quite
nice
a
little
worty
for
me
ideally
but
pretty
close
to
real
beer
in
terms
of
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
twistoff
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
biggish
foamy
head
is
active
but
not
too
fast
creamywhitish
the
beer
is
a
clear
gold
hinting
at
being
deep
lots
of
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
sugary
corn
man
thats
some
sweet
corn
it
carries
over
to
the
dusty
front
the
middle
shows
some
caramel
but
theres
a
chemical
distraction
finish
is
fairly
bitter
never
losing
the
sweet
corn
this
is
an
ok
na
the
bitterness
at
the
end
is
pleasant
second
tier
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
though
its
not
truelly
horrid
really
drinkable
the
best
na
brew
i
have
yet
tasted
a
crystalclear
deepgold
body
is
topped
by
a
goodsized
head
of
creamy
brightwhite
foam
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
splotchy
lace
about
the
glass
standardsized
bubbles
race
towards
the
surface
obviously
adding
to
its
retention
a
distinctly
grainy
malt
greets
you
in
the
nose
along
with
some
skunky
hops
despite
the
brown
glass
bottle
the
body
is
medium
and
its
median
level
carbonation
leaves
it
crisp
on
the
tongue
the
same
rich
grainy
malt
appears
in
the
flavor
although
it
tastes
a
bit
cooked
its
worty
and
similar
to
liquid
extract
malt
some
floral
and
spicy
hops
come
through
the
malt
and
its
backed
by
a
bold
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
with
just
a
thin
layer
of
residual
sticky
malt
served
well
chilled
it
passes
as
a
fair
substitue
for
a
quality
german
pilsner
as
it
warms
and
the
true
flavor
of
the
malt
becomes
more
apparent
however
it
loses
some
of
its
refreshing
character
and
becomes
a
bit
cloying
this
rating
is
based
on
the
fact
that
this
is
the
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
tried
in
this
style
from
any
where
in
the
world
if
you
want
something
that
actually
tastes
like
beer
without
the
alcohol
this
is
actually
quite
good
worth
a
shot
soft
and
creamy
taste
with
a
nice
aftertaste
o
surprisingly
good
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
easily
as
good
as
many
macros
o
the
best
alcohol
free
beer
that
i
have
tried
so
far
o
im
not
impressed
although
im
not
an
expert
on
weissbiers
ive
had
better
nonalcoholic
wheat
beers
the
traditional
flavours
are
there
but
it
seems
watered
down
and
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
nasty
perhaps
it
could
work
better
with
food
o
well
this
beer
is
clearly
for
those
who
cant
enjoy
real
beer
considering
that
not
too
bad
overall
slightly
watery
and
a
touch
metallic
but
still
drinkable
much
better
than
dealing
with
most
light
beers
out
there
if
you
have
to
drive
bottle
damned

was
forced
to
have
one
of
these
at
a
german
restaurant
after
downing
its
big
brother
first
i
should
have
done
it
in
the
reverse
order
appearance
is
what
what
you
would
expect
of
a
hefe
hazy
luminous
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
smell
was
very
much
attenuated
in
comparison
to
real
beer
although
the
bread
banana
clove
combination
was
in
evidence
same
goes
for
the
taste
but
slight
latex
and
metalic
notes
where
evident
palate
was
a
little
watery
and
heavily
carbonated
damned
good
attempt
at
a
la
beer
but
beer
without
alcohol
is
just
not
beer
NA
light
yellow
with
etched
surface
bubbles
smells
like
sweet
grains
bread
a
little
hint
of
peppercorn
kinda
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
a
nice
dry
salami
paper
taste
is
cleanly
grain
some
wheat
bread
some
white
grape
juice
a
little
sweeter
than
id
prefer
touch
of
herbal
hops
and
a
little
bitterness
light
bodied
with
soft
for
the
style
albeit
hi
carb
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
bad
a
little
sweet
and
reminiscent
of
cheap
wheat
bread
but
hey
good
enough
very
nice
low
alcohol
beer
far
better
than
everything
else
low
alcohol
that
i
have
tasted
o
very
good
for
what
it
is
it
could
easily
pass
as
a
decent
euro
pale
lager
aroma
is
of
bitter
hops
and
biscuity
tastes
of
bitter
hops
and
malty
sweet
but
not
very
balanced
bitter
aftertaste
fizzy
because
the
carbonation
is
strong
for
being
an
alcoholfree
it
is
pretty
good
o
this
is
actually
not
a
bad
beer
for
being
an
alcoholfree
quite
nice
this
stuff
will
actually
do
in
a
pinch
although
more
enjoyable
straight
out
of
the
bottle
at
least
it
provided
me
a
bit
of
a
hop
fix
in
the
mean
time
id
pin
it
as
someplace
around
german
pils
territory
stylewise
drinkability
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
the
last
time
i
had
tried
a
nonalcoholic
beer
was
about
10
years
ago
and
i
hadnt
manage
to
finish
it
off
i
dont
plan
on
making
friends
here
but
this
ones
much
better
overall
the
metallic
bite
is
just
too
much
this
is
a
drainpour
even
my
burps
are
metallic
never
again
dr
if
this
type
of
beer
is
your
bag
have
at
it
but
leave
me
out
of
it
i
wont
have
it
again
an
acceptable
alternative
to
stronger
beers
although
more
hops
would
probably
improve
it
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
not
too
bad
for
low
alcohol
brew
widely
refreshing
final
very
weak
edit
scores
adjusted
slightly
after
having
tested
a
couple
of
these
cans
i
must
admit
im
a
little
less
positive
m
d
i
couldnt
finish
a
330
ml
can
it
feels
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
others
of
the
style
that
ive
had
then
again
its
no
gem
and
id
still
recommend
that
you
avoid
it
if
you
need
to
do
an
na
for
some
reason
this
is
definitely
a
top
contender
in
that
category
there
are
some
drinkable
german
alcohol
free
beers
out
there
but
this
aint
one
of
them
i
always
seem
to
see
this
one
when
i
am
in
the
middle
east
all
in
all
it
is
not
a
bad
near
beer
it
has
a
good
straw
yellow
color
the
carbonation
is
good
it
has
bubbles
throughout
the
body
with
a
nice
head
and
lace
the
aroma
and
taste
are
very
pilsner
like
sweet
and
malty
earthy
and
just
a
little
bit
of
crisp
and
clean
fruit
tones
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
not
bad
on
a
desert
night
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
poured
with
a
short
bright
white
head
that
left
a
small
wall
of
lace
a
few
streams
of
bubbles
rise
around
the
edge
of
the
transparent
sunshine
colored
beer
spicy
hops
in
the
aroma
are
joined
by
a
sweetness
that
is
more
artificial
sugar
then
malt
based
this
seems
to
be
typical
for
alcohol
free
pilsish
beers
wow
the
body
is
awesome
on
this
one
moderately
full
with
an
infusion
of
fine
carbonation
a
bitter
grassyness
pervades
the
flavor
but
there
is
again
an
underlying
sweetness
some
of
the
sweet
flavor
comes
off
as
pale
malt
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
but
towards
the
finish
it
becomes
increasingly
artificialcorny
after
a
few
sips
the
finish
resembles
more
unfermented
malt
then
anything
else
not
that
this
isnt
fully
fermented
it
just
tastes
like
wort
if
they
could
just
tone
down
the
sweetness
this
would
pass
for
a
good
pilsner
or
helles
poured
a
clear
golden
body
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
the
best
part
of
the
beer
scents
of
skunk
apple
juice
and
a
bit
of
spicy
noble
hops
honey
and
pilsner
malt
overall
impression
is
of
a
typical
euro
pale
lager
aroma
that
is
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
and
brought
down
a
touch
by
the
skunk
pleasant
but
simple
flavor
begins
with
flavors
of
grainy
malt
sweet
pilsner
malt
and
honey
this
moves
into
a
skunky
flavor
of
grain
grain
husk
a
bit
of

with

aftertaste

and
a

overall
impression
is
of
a
very
grainy
lager
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
an
off
flavor
that
drags
the
entire
thing
down
it
is
not
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
impression
is
of
a
nice
lager
the
best
part
of
the
beer
overall
it
is
a
pretty
bad
lager
the
aroma
is
okay
but
the
flavor
is
terrible
and
the
mouthfeel
is
standard
not
worth
having
honestly
if
you
want
a
low
abv
beer
drink
a
lindemans
o
i
kept
drinking
it
till
the
end
reminded
me
too
much
of
malta
goya
when
all
was
said
and
done
and
i
love
that
shit
sort
of
beerlike
flavors
going
on
but
you
can
tell
somethings
up
with
it
allinall
id
recommend
this
but
with
the
caveat
that
it
tastes
like
a
beerflavored
soft
drink
i
dont
know
what
so
many
people
have
against
na
beer
theres
plenty
of
times
when
id
love
to
drink
something
beerlike
but
because
of
personal
or
professional
obligations
i
cant
work
up
a
buzz
this
is
is
very
tasty
if
drinking
it
didnt
make
me
look
like
a
recovering
alcoholic
id
have
it
way
more
often
from
a
green
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
102013
long
shelf
life
overall
drinkability
this
is
easily
the
best
na
beer
ive
ever
had
granted
that
is
not
saying
much
at
all
but
this
is
genuinely
a
pretty
good
beer
i
am
reviewing
this
on
the
na
curve
as
i
would
with
any
other
beer
thats
not
my
style
this
is
king
of
the
na
beers
o
this
is
what
a
na
beer
should
be
it
tastes
like
beer
its
well
made
and
its
refreshing
this
is
the
beer
i
will
pound
when
i
want
to
pound
beer
overall
not
too
bad
considering
its
non
alcoholic
if
it
wasnt
so
sweet
it
would
be
fairly
decent
o
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
drinkable
for
being
nonalcoholic
and
shares
a
lot
of
similarities
with
a
german
pilsener
except
that
it
has
less
bitterness
and
no
dryness
o
this
is
definitely
the
best
tasting
low
alcohol
beer
that
i
have
ever
experienced
if
this
was
a
blind
taste
test
im
sure
i
would
not
be
able
to
tell
this
was
essentially
alcohol
free
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
pours
a
tad
deeper
yellow
than
most
nonalchohol
brews
decent
but
short
lived
head
a
little
lacing
it
does
have
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
more
beery
that
is
a
touch
of
pale
malt
is
noticible
this
is
overall
not
that
bad
a
good
choice
for
those
times
you
can
not
drink
the
real
deal
green
bottle
so
expecting
skunk
pale
golden
color
nose
is
ferocious
skunk
maybe
a
mushroom
juice
component
in
there
skunk
cereal
grain
on
palate
malt
sweet
light
hops
light
body
goes
down
easy
so
long
as
you
can
tolerate
the
skunk
better
than
a
normal
abv
american
adjunct
lager
though
and
the
beer
is
clausthaler
premium
appears
to
be
some
sort
of
german
nonalcoholic
beer
good
news
is
that
if
this
is
the
other
kill
shot
than
there
are
none
left
my
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
strong
presence
of
saaz
and
some
underlying
malt
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
good
balancing
of
hops
and
malt
on
the
tongue
finish
was
really
hoppy
surprisingly
so
it
started
out
a
little
watery
but
i
think
that
if
i
either
closed
my
eyes
or
had
it
presented
to
me
blindly
i
would
not
think
that
i
were
drinking
an
n
a
beer
this
is
mighty
impressive
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
is
after
a
tasty
n
a
beer
yes
such
people
do
exist
drinkability
minus
the
whole
noalcohol
thing
its
not
worse
than
a
lot
of
icky
illconceived
lagers
running
loose
out
there
hmmm
kind
of
tastes
like
beer
this
is
probably
the
best
na
beer
ive
ever
had
its
medium
to
light
in
body
got
some
nice
graininess
in
there
and
finishes
cleanly
there
is
a
mild
sulfurish
taste
to
it
but
its
no
worse
than
a
mediocre
pilsner
that
was
stored
incorrectly
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
unless
i
need
a
liver
transplant
but
its
good
to
know
this
beer
exists
its
the
first
example
ive
drank
more
than
2
ounces
of
before
pouring
it
out
d
i
dont
expect
much
from
a
low
alcohol
beer
but
this
was
pretty
pitiful
if
youre
buying
near
beer
there
plenty
of
better
options
and
its
low
in
calories
to
boot
d
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
buckler
is
still
probably
the
best
nonalcoholic
beer
ive
tried
so
far
review
from
tasting
notes
dated
03
jun
2009
d
well
its
a
nonalcoholic
beer
i
suppose
it
doesnt
get
much
more
drinkable
drinkability
is
so
so
just
like
the
taste
if
you
really
need
that
somewhat
beer
flavor
without
the
alcohol
its
ok
but
i
would
rather
drink
something
i
enjoy
diet
dew
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
bad
for
my
first
near
beer
not
a
big
fan
clausthaler
premium
is
not
a
good
beverage
i
have
a
tough
time
calling
it
beer
its
more
of
an
impostor
the
only
real
flavor
im
getting
out
of
it
is
corn
that
doesnt
work
very
well
i
think
this
is
my
first
noalcohol
beer
ever
i
may
never
have
another
after
this
experience
bad
choice
if
your
looking
for
alternative
refreshment
notes
from
7305
good
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
d
good
for
what
it
is
not
something
i
would
buy
personally
but
a
good
take
on
the
style
true
nonalcoholic
beers
kinda
suck
however
this
is
cleary
the
best
one
out
there
i
would
also
drink
this
over
bud
light
its
nice
to
know
that
if
my
liver
takes
a
shit
on
me
i
can
at
least
have
this
12
ounce
bottle
best
by
end
of
0908
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
average
it
smells
like
sweet
malt
and
doughbread
no
hops
that
i
can
notice
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
nonoffensive
no
off
or
skunky
aromas
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
bready
and
sweet
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
with
that
being
said
it
doesnt
taste
bad
ive
certainly
drank
worse
beers
yeah
i
know
this
is
nonalcoholic
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
thin
but
crisp
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
if
i
was
somewhere
that
only
had
na
beers
id
drink
it
again
for
the
style
i
think
its
decent
drinkability
wouldnt
drink
it
if
something
else
was
available
this
beir
has
a
wonderful
bitterness
very
like
a
na
pilsner
colour
is
light
golden
yellow
low
no
head
but
some
sparse
lacing
has
a
wonderful
flavour
to
it
grassy
and
crisp
one
of
the
nicer
nonalcoholics
clausthaler
seems
to
know
how
to
do
nas
drinkability
i
cant
know
unless
it
really
happens
but
if
for
some
reason
i
couldnt
drink
alcohol
i
dont
know
that
i
would
turn
to
this
stuff
too
often
i
would
certainly
drink
a
lot
of
beverages
over
this
in
that
future
and
its
the
flavor
not
the
lack
of
booze
d
honestly
this
is
an
easy
drinking
na
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
any
dd
at
a
bar
where
it
was
available
not
something
i
would
drink
normally
but
if
the
doc
said
i
couldnt
drink
alcohol
anymore
then
this
would
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
occasionally
as
long
as
your
expectations
of
an
na
beer
arent
too
high
this
will
pass
as
drinkable
all
in
all
better
than
many
nas
out
there
easy
to
drink
quickly
which
i
think
is
best
at
5abv
i
know
we
dont
want
to
judge
beer
when
its
too
cold
but
here
i
think
its
more
appropriate
the
sharp
crisp
character
is
this
beers
strong
suit
and
it
loses
it
quickly
as
it
warms
my
first
ever
na
beer
looks
very
inviting
with
a
shiny
gold
luster
and
a
thin
brittle
white
head
aromas
are
sweet
and
musty
here
we
go
down
the
hatch
damn
not
foul
at
all
im
impressed
this
is
extremely
light
with
very
thin
malt
base
and
a
big
artificial
fruit
characer
kind
of
like
someone
steeped
a
red
fruitrollup
in
it
that
blends
suprisingly
well
with
a
metallic
finish
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
im
not
spitting
it
out
like
i
expected
to
its
very
drinkable
even
if
that
is
attributable
to
its
wateriness
d
once
i
get
past
the
tomato
this
has
some
nice
distinct
grain
flavors
with
a
little
hops
but
it
could
use
more
the
bloodhound
factor
benji
and
peaches
really
dug
this
one
good
i
hate
to
see
beer
wasted
as
i
was
gonna
just
pour
it
out
6
08
6pack
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
dissipates
and
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
smell
is
of
grains
and
a
slight
skunkiness
to
it
couldnt
really
find
any
hop
aroma
taste
is
real
watery
with
a
slight
taste
of
grain
and
skunkiness
no
hops
detected
seems
to
be
a
little
overcarbonated
with
virtually
no
body
i
just
cant
give
any
higher
than
a
one
for
drinkability
less
than
one
of
these
is
more
than
enough
drinkability
i
used
to
think
this
was
some
pretty
damn
good
na
beer
when
i
was
18
or
so
used
to
even
think
it
competed
with
regular
beer
guess
i
was
a
touch
mistaken
not
very
good
at
all
in
any
capacity
drink
some
oj
or
something
else
good
for
you
pours
pretty
enough
with
a
clear
golden
color
and
a
small
white
head
not
much
bubbling
action
and
the
foam
falls
to
a
ring
smell
is
sweet
barley
soup
grains
predominant
with
that
euro
lager
hop
odor
not
inviting
at
all
the
taste
is
cloying
wet
like
a
skunky
heineken
mouthfeel
is
thin
watery
with
a
finish
that
is
unpleasant
probably
from
the
unfermented
malts
not
really
drinkable
but
this
could
be
because
i
dont
care
for
this
style
when
it
has
alcohol
let
alone
the
na
version
if
this
is
the
3
low
alcohol
beer
on
the
planet
then
this
is
a
style
that
has
a
looong
way
to
go
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
be
that
hard
to
brew
a
decent
beer
with
low
or
no
alcohol
but
then
my
brewing
knowledge
would
fit
comfortably
on
the
head
of
a
pin
edge
to
clausthaler
premium
for
whatever
thats
worth
i
usually
drink
becks
na
as
my
na
beer
of
choice
but
this
is
a
much
better
attempt
to
recreate
a
german
pils
good
hop
nose
and
a
decent
full
midbody
help
you
beleive
that
this
is
regular
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
when
the
need
arises
to
have
no
alcohol
but
still
want
beer
taste
its
drinkable
in
that
if
one
cannot
have
alcohol
for
whatever
reason
this
probably
comes
the
closest
to
a
bmc
beer
for
that
crowd
this
would
satify
the
palate
however
after
being
exposed
to
so
many
other
good
beer
this
is
a
limp
water
sodalike
drink
good
for
the
style
not
good
for
beer
this
beer
looks
the
part
but
its
ultimately
a
hollow
specter
lacking
any
real
substance
and
unable
to
provide
true
satisfaction
the
color
is
a
fine
high
gold
with
a
reasonably
good
head
and
lace
the
aroma
contains
a
trace
of
greenglass
euroskunk
with
some
graininess
and
a
pleasant
breadyeast
the
caramel
sweetness
is
unhampered
by
alcohol
so
the
cake
and
bread
crust
flavors
are
more
noticeable
than
a
traditional
beer
hops
are
tart
and
quite
forceful
there
is
something
off
though
an
unpleasant
chemical
flavor
like
something
plastic
sat
in
the
beer
for
a
spell
its
a
fake
taste
which
fits
cause
you
could
say
this
is
a
fake
beer
cookie
and
shortbread
flavors
struggle
to
the
top
and
the
beer
ends
up
being
sweeter
than
it
should
be
its
not
awful
in
fact
if
this
was
the
only
option
it
wouldnt
be
the
end
of
the
world
but
there
must
be
better
nas
out
there
12
ouncer
sampled
my
fatherinlaw
left
a
few
bottles
on
his
last
visit
time
to
give
it
a
try
pours
light
golden
witha
white
decent
looking
head
even
leaves
some
light
well
developed
lacing
no
nose
that
i
could
pick
up
light
malty
brew
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
quaff
not
much
flavor
or
interest
but
at
the
same
time
no
nasty
off
flavors
present
for
what
its
worth
id
rather
drink
this
then
bud
and
its
ilk
probably
better
for
ya
as
well
light
bodied
this
is
by
far
the
best
na
beer
ive
had
but
to
revisit
the
point
why
bother
it
pours
well
with
a
nice
golden
color
tastes
hoppy
and
is
on
the
sweet
side
a
very
smooth
beer
nice
beer
to
have
while
on
the
porch
and
chatting
good
move
if
you
are
the
designated
driver
other
than
that
leave
it
alone
thanks
to
my
distributor
for
the
sample
of
this
and
dab
low
carb
lord
knows
i
wouldnt
have
bought
them
on
my
own
please
note
ive
rated
this
beer
compared
to
other
nonalcoholic
brews
i
would
really
like
to
know
if
non
alcoholic
lagers
should
be
rated
in
its
own
special
category
when
drinking
say
buckler
one
could
say
no
as
it
may
even
be
competitive
in
the
market
but
cmon
clausthaler
must
be
one
of
the
worst
nas
ever
conceived
not
only
because
of
its
ridiculous
sourbitter
taste
that
leaves
you
confused
at
the
end
but
perhaps
because
of
its
awful
sodalike
excessive
carbonation
you
judge
clausthaler
na
offers
lots
of
toasted
malt
with
a
good
amount
of
bitter
hops
to
make
this
brew
a
winner
in
my
book
12
ounce
green
bottle
not
bad
for
a
near
beer
the
nose
is
skunky
with
some
corn
i
actually
dont
mind
a
little
skunking
in
an
na
the
front
is
dusty
the
middle
corny
the
finish
slightly
sour
this
is
an
ok
na
but
i
like
their
amber
quite
a
bit
more
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
fairly
large
snowwhite
head
slight
carbonation
and
decent
lace
aroma
of
unfermented
wort
a
strong
caramel
and
toffee
note
and
some
hops
taste
begins
with
substantial
and
slightly
malt
flavor
followed
by
generous
amounts
of
hops
the
hops
nicely
balance
out
the
excessive
sweetness
of
the
malt
giving
this
beer
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
quite
respectable
even
for
a
conventional
beer
this
is
among
the
very
best
of
the
several
na
beers
that
i
have
tried
brilliant
golden
hue
smallish
white
head
with
poor
retention
no
lace
the
nose
was
hampered
greatly
because
this
sample
seems
to
be
lightstruck
but
hey
if
they
sell
them
in
green
bottles
what
can
you
expect
oily
some
hops
are
present
on
the
palate
leafy
grassy
some
malt
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
mediumlight
body
the
lack
of
alcohol
doesnt
seem
to
be
bothersome
clausthaler
premium
is
a
good
brew
recommend
for
anyone
who
needs
to
drink
near
beer
notes
there
are
worse
regular
beers
out
there
but
then
why
drink
this
unless
you
have
to
knock
on
wood
that
i
will
never
have
to
come
to
that
point
of
drinking
na
beer
i
was
surprised
that
i
actually
kind
of
liked
the
taste
of
this
nonalcoholic
green
bottled
beer
crazy
imagine
that
for
my
first
na
beer
this
isnt
that
bad
if
i
had
to
drink
more
of
this
for
whatever
reason
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
its
actually
pretty
enjoyable
to
sip
this
and
not
worry
about
having
to
drive
after
i
finish
my
glass
if
this
is
the
best
na
beer
out
there
then
i
will
have
to
pick
up
some
bad
examples
drink
for
a
na
this
was
actually
pretty
good
unique
to
me
how
they
can
do
this
recommended
to
those
who
want
some
beer
taste
wo
a
big
abv
hit
overall
this
is
quite
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
pours
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
displays
moderate
retention
and
minimal
lace
smells
of
skunk
corn
light
bits
of
caramel
slightly
bready
malty
aroma
if
it
werent
for
the
skunk
this
wouldnt
smell
half
bad
taste
is
bready
and
caramel
malty
with
a
hint
of
earth
again
not
half
bad
thin
body
spirited
level
of
carbonation
bubbly
foamy
mouthfeel
lacks
any
kind
of
body
tastes
okay
if
it
werent
for
the
style
tick
i
would
have
never
bought
this
not
too
bad
for
an
alcohol
free
i
guess
overall
drinkability
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
a
low
alcohol
beer
and
i
can
say
that
it
has
a
lot
more
flavor
than
i
expected
went
well
with
food
pasta
with
basil
tomato
sauce
but
i
cant
see
drinking
it
by
itself
with
food
pretty
good
without
food
interesting
but
the
smell
puts
me
off
a
bit
glad
that
i
could
pick
up
a
single
and
not
a
whole
pack
of
thet
stuff
pours
a
light
honey
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
tiny
spots
and
splotches
of
lacing
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grain
and
slight
honey
and
citrus
notes
taste
is
of
sweet
grain
corn
flakes
honey
and
a
citrus
zest
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
pretty
mild
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
low
alcohol
beer
and
the
first
i
have
actually
ever
had
to
me
this
tastes
pretty
real
and
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
if
i
ever
needed
such
a
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
offwhite
head
that
recedes
somewhat
quickly
into
a
thin
cap
some
slight
spotty
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
amount
of
caramel
it
smells
like
like
caramel
malt
after
being
milled
not
so
bad
at
all
a
bit
of
graininess
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
tastes
just
like
caramel
malt
though
there
isnt
much
sweetness
there
just
a
touch
actually
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
actually
not
a
halfbad
brew
good
job
golden
amber
as
the
name
indicates
small
head
that
quickly
diminished
and
clung
only
slightly
smells
somewhat
light
struck
because
of
the
green
bottle
ive
had
fresher
in
the
past
thankfully
no
skunk
taste
taste
is
malty
without
being
sweet
finishes
very
crisp
with
no
linger
there
is
a
nonsweet
honey
taste
in
there
that
reminds
me
of
wet
sweet
grass
imo
na
beers
in
a
way
are
like
a
batch
of
chocolate
cookies
in
which
one
forgot
to
add
one
of
the
ingredients
every
bite
or
in
this
case
sip
reminds
me
that
clausthaler
is
solid
but
lacks
whatever
flavor
the
alcohol
would
have
imparted
id
recommend
this
medium
bodied
brew
to
anybody
who
needswants
to
avoid
the
effects
of
alcohol
the
pour
netted
me
about
a
fingerandahalf
of
rocky
tawny
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenamber
talk
about
truth
in
advertising
with
neplus
quality
clarity
i
could
see
into
the
future
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
nose
smelled
strongly
of
saaz
hops
underlain
by
a
faint
maltiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slight
astringency
in
the
mouth
much
drier
than
its
classic
counterpart
finish
was
mildly
hoppy
slightly
malty
nicely
balanced
once
more
i
felt
that
this
was
an
n
a
beer
that
could
easily
have
fooled
me
in
a
blind
tasting
it
has
a
welldeserved
reputation
as
one
of
the
better
beers
in
its
style
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
interested
in
this
style
the
beer
pours
golden
amber
imagine
that
the
color
is
reminiscent
of
molasses
very
clear
not
many
bubbles
theres
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
given
the
nonexistent
head
a
sweet
stale
vegetable
smell
with
notes
of
black
tea
and
honey
this
beer
gives
an
overall
impression
of
lemony
iced
tea
theres
some
tart
citrus
and
a
raw
malt
flavor
with
notes
of
cornbread
sugar
and
tea
leaves
the
lively
tingly
mouthfeel
doesnt
really
work
with
the
flavor
profile
here
it
feels
more
like
they
were
aiming
for
an
adjunct
lager
or
pilsner
overall
its
drinkable
and
somewhat
refreshing
though
a
little
messy
i
think
d
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
although
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
it
again
because
of
the
unusual
tea
flavor
di
finally
found
this
one
near
me
and
i
have
to
agree
with
its
place
atop
the
leaderboard
here
i
guarantee
you
could
pour
this
for
a
lot
of
people
and
tell
them
it
was
a
real
beer
and
only
true
afficianodos
would
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
a
nice
substitute
when
you
dont
want
the
alcohol
not
as
good
as
most
regular
beers
but
better
than
some
of
the
shit
ones
d
this
one
of
the
better
low
alcohol
beers
out
there
its
the
finish
that
cuts
this
beers
score
the
odd
flavor
in
the
end
really
detracted
from
the
overall
experience
beer
is
heavier
than
the
other
one
but
lighter
in
flavor
with
a
big
aftertaste
the
sweetness
creeps
up
on
you
there
is
a
grainy
aftertaste
and
almost
no
midpalate
character
i
think
the
premium
is
better
this
one
is
harder
to
drink
for
me
and
its
got
more
sweetness
which
is
what
i
dont
like
about
these
beers
they
are
all
too
sweet
this
has
been
my
review
drinkability
this
one
almost
tastes
like
a
non
sweetened
iced
tea
i
get
some
beer
but
not
enough
to
make
me
want
this
again
nice
and
dry
for
a
beer
in
this
style
d
overall
not
bad
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
i
would
rather
just
drink
a
beer
99100
times
but
i
suppose
this
beer
has
its
time
and
place
d
drinkability
is
not
bad
its
much
better
than
expected
actually
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
other
european
lagers
ive
had
in
the
distant
past
would
i
have
this
again
not
if
i
can
help
it
is
it
a
good
nonalcoholic
alternative
to
beer
i
would
have
to
say
yes
yes
it
is
the
best
na
beer
i
have
tasted
so
far
maybe
the
best
lownon
alcohol
beer
i
have
had
and
still
not
very
good
its
a
shame
than
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
good
alcohol
free
beer
alternative
out
there
overall
doesnt
compare
to
alcoholic
amber
ales
but
that
isnt
what
it
is
trying
to
do
is
it
i
am
impressed
surprisingly
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
nonalcoholic
offering
if
i
did
not
know
any
better
i
would
have
guessed
this
to
be
a
decent
regular
euro
lager
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
want
a
beer
but
have
to
avoid
alcohol
a
pleasant
surprise
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
drinks
pretty
decent
i
must
say
id
much
rather
respect
beer
overall
i
can
appreciate
a
good
n
a
but
for
me
this
one
didnt
do
it
that
weird
metal
taste
stuck
to
me
even
though
it
did
disappear
midway
through
it
still
left
its
trace
on
me
it
upset
my
stomach
a
little
and
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
taste
follows
the
nose
but
in
a
less
drastic
way
slightly
chewy
in
a
sense
on
the
flavor
though
more
so
at
the
top
of
the
mouth
versus
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
yet
a
bit
shallow
not
a
lot
of
depth
here
yet
not
much
expected
decent
feel
with
an
almost
cream
sodalike
finish
albeit
without
the
fizzy
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
and
tastes
sweeter
than
the
75
calories
it
is
d
you
know
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beverage
i
might
be
more
inclined
to
have
one
of
these
instead
of
a
soda
if
i
was
the
dd
i
wouldnt
be
totally
embarrassed
to
drink
this
at
a
party
the
carbonation
gets
a
little
bloaty
but
otherwise
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
review
to
style
this
is
quite
good
a
solid
4
0
light
goldenamber
with
a
small
whispy
offwhite
head
that
dies
but
leaves
a
decent
lace
aromas
of
light
malts
and
faint
faint
hops
taste
is
grassy
and
slightly
malty
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
dry
and
light
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
refreshing
alternative
for
your
dd
drinkability
for
an
na
beer
this
may
be
as
good
as
it
gets
for
appearance
flavor
and
aroma
easy
to
quaff
and
the
price
is
reasonable
if
you
enjoy
a
lowalcohol
beer
now
and
then
you
simply
must
give
this
one
a
go
a
package
of
glasses
arrived
today
that
i
won
on
ebay
what
to
do
i
caint
drank
tonite
along
comes
clausthaler
golden
amber
nonalcoholic
to
save
the
night
nice
biting
crispness
very
tasty
beverage
and
not
just
because
its
a
na
i
fooled
a
couple
of
people
with
this
but
it
sucks
once
it
warms
up
i
dont
really
see
much
point
in
nonalcoholic
beer
but
this
one
has
intrigued
me
for
quite
a
long
time
and
today
i
was
given
the
chance
to
purchase
a
single
of
it
it
poured
a
crystal
clear
copper
colour
with
a
white
head
that
faded
away
almost
instantly
the
smell
was
quite
sweet
and
reminded
me
of
some
german
doppelbocks
loads
of
sweet
malts
and
that
maple
pancake
syrup
smell
that
celebrator
has
i
certaily
wasnt
expecting
that
taste
too
was
nearly
entirely
malt
sweet
malt
mouthfeel
was
of
course
quite
thin
but
there
was
a
decent
level
of
co2
present
here
and
considering
what
this
is
im
going
to
be
rather
lenient
again
considering
what
this
is
i
found
it
highly
drinkable
would
i
rather
have
a
st
bernardus
abt
12
of
course
i
would
but
if
i
had
to
choose
a
nonalcoholic
beer
for
some
ungodly
reason
id
choose
this
hands
down
over
all
that
american
garbage
such
as
odouls
and
miller
sharp
and
so
forth
im
impressed
best
na
ive
had
so
far
this
is
the
first
one
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
pour
in
a
glass
impossible
to
find
in
pa
asked
local
beer
store
to
order
and
they
were
unable
to
find
finallly
located
it
in
delaware
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
nice
head
smell
is
not
overally
attractive
but
better
than
most
na
beers
taste
is
good
for
an
na
beer
but
the
unfermented
malt
taste
is
still
there
ok
for
an
na
beer
this
isnt
a
very
dark
amber
lager
it
looks
like
a
czech
pilsner
actually
its
the
color
of
apple
juice
with
a
big
firm
head
ive
noticed
all
na
beers
have
lots
of
head
lots
of
bubbles
on
the
side
of
the
glass
which
is
distracting
aroma
pretty
bland
flavor
has
some
caramelbread
sweetness
and
a
mellow
but
effective
hop
quality
indicative
of
a
herbalmineral
pilsner
its
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
beer
quenches
thirst
very
well
and
this
is
a
worthwhile
beer
to
examine
if
youre
eliminating
alcohol
starts
out
kinda
tasty
as
fizzy
malt
teas
go
pours
amber
under
a
thick
head
that
looks
slightly
processed
a
nice
malty
taste
and
for
once
a
pleasing
snootful
of
german
hops
then
a
strange
barrage
of
off
flavors
and
sugars
sets
in
its
nice
that
theres
an
na
beer
that
tries
to
make
up
for
its
weak
malt
profile
by
adding
some
hops
but
this
still
needs
some
work
12
ounce
bottle
one
of
the
few
nonalcohol
brews
i
actually
like
overall
a
welldone
na
that
i
would
drink
again
if
a
situation
would
call
for
it
awesome
na
id
actually
drink
this
without
so
much
as
a
complaint
in
fact
i
can
think
of
plenty
real
beers
that
id
chose
this
over
pours
out
to
a
light
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
fairly
large
head
there
is
alot
of
carboination
present
many
bubbles
in
this
one
the
taste
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
the
caramel
malt
taste
with
a
slight
sweetness
really
adds
to
the
drinkability
factory
and
it
doesnt
leave
a
dry
mouth
like
most
nas
if
youve
had
an
odouls
amber
this
is
similar
but
with
profoundly
more
taste
this
actually
tastes
like
beer
glowing
amber
hue
with
a
thinning
white
head
of
foam
and
has
nice
stringy
lace
patches
that
hold
well
smell
is
light
and
caramelly
sweet
of
malts
taste
is
a
bit
more
of
the
same
with
a
sweet
sensible
caramel
tone
at
first
carbonation
is
light
and
holds
through
to
a
floral
fresh
hop
finish
not
bad
for
a
lighter
beer
feel
is
medium
body
to
lighter
feel
with
an
airy
dry
finish
played
out
a
bit
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
of
it
due
to
it
being
na
which
is
actually
a
surprising
quality
cuz
it
really
tasted
like
albiet
weaker
lager
styled
beer
deep
amber
color
with
perfect
clarity
and
a
large
snowwhite
head
lace
is
truly
excellent
carbonation
is
slight
aroma
is
quite
pronounced
with
strong
notes
of
malt
extract
and
caramel
sweetness
taste
begins
with
slight
carbonation
and
pronounced
caramel
malts
towards
the
middle
of
the
taste
these
assume
a
tart
note
finish
is
dominated
by
herbal
hops
these
balance
out
the
sweet
malts
rather
well
mouth
feel
is
excellent
for
a
na
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
nonalcoholic
beer
that
i
have
tried
it
certainly
beats
a
soda
for
refreshment
the
smell
is
corn
syrup
with
some
malt
the
front
is
paper
giving
way
to
a
malty
middle
slight
bitterness
can
be
detected
in
the
finish
ive
tried
a
lot
of
nas
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
notes
actually
not
that
bad
for
a
nonalcoholic
brew
more
flavour
than
most
na
beers
to
sum
it
up
if
you
have
to
drink
na
beer
and
you
want
flavour
this
is
your
brew
less
than
05
abv
everything
to
expect
from
an
na
somehow
this
was
a
lot
better
than
expected
someone
gave
it
to
me
when
i
said
i
didnt
want
a
busch
light
because
i
had
to
drive
i
had
never
had
an
na
beer
before
so
this
was
new
not
a
lot
of
flavor
as
you
might
guess
its
not
offensive
or
awful
though
this
of
course
isnt
bound
to
be
a
favorite
of
bas
but
i
bet
there
are
worse
examples
out
there
busch
na
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
less
than
0
50
it
is
known
as
a
non
alocholic
low
alcohol
beer
the
brew
pours
out
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
light
with
grains
and
malts
busch
na
has
a
nice
light
taste
but
you
pick
up
on
some
grains
an
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
also
most
like
water
for
what
it
is
worth
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
if
you
are
looking
for
a
brew
with
low
alcohol
then
this
is
the
brew
for
you
this
one
of
the
better
na
brews
on
the
market
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
solid
3
5
out
of
5
overall
the
box
is
decorated
with
awards
i
wouldnt
go
that
far
it
is
however
better
than
busch
light
and
has
less
calories
to
boot
not
as
good
as
busch
regular
of
course
and
thats
to
be
expected
sure
id
have
another
bland
boring
lacking
in
flavor
aroma
and
body
looks
like
pee
no
lacing
decent
carbonation
maintained
a
1
12
finger
head
for
a
little
while
before
dissipating
into
a
thin
film
tastes
of
slightly
sour
corn
and
cooked
vegetables
good
for
quenching
your
thirst
or
washing
down
cheap
pizza
and
burgers
and
not
much
else
with
half
the
calories
of
a
soda
drinks
like
water
o
not
bad
but
i
did
not
have
very
high
expectations
for
this
beer
at
least
it
tastes
like
beer
and
is
not
as
watery
as
some
of
the
lights
beers
from
bmc
breweries
the
nose
is
grainy
malts
with
a
clean
crispiness
at
the
end
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
subtle
sweetness
too
the
body
is
light
it
is
comparable
to
other
low
alcohol
beers
in
its
class
and
it
is
reasonably
priced
overall
a
good
value
and
nothing
unpleasant
for
the
style
just
not
much
flavor
by
no
means
is
this
a
great
hell
even
a
good
beer
but
if
you
cant
drink
or
if
you
are
the
designated
driver
and
want
that
beer
feel

is
way
better
than

regular
if
given
a
choice
between
the
two
and
also
if
youre
looking
for
an
na
i
believe
this
is
the
allaround
one
to
get
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
lower
in
the

this
stuff
is
probably
somewhat
good
for
you

give

5it
looks
like
an
average
beer
very
light
not
much
to
get
excited
about
but
not
off
putting
please
stop
calling
this
beer
for
this
style
there
could
be
worse
but
not
much
worse
overall
better
than
coors
na
but
that
is
not
saying
a
lot
i
guess
this
product
is
supposed
to
satisfy
the
taste
of
a
cheap
american
brew
it
is
horrible
to
the
point
that
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
i
know
you
are
probably
asking
why
i
would
even
indulge
in
this
beverage
well
but
i
know
i
had
the
disadvantage
of
pouring
this
product
into
my
glass
for
one
reason
or
another
it
isnt
even
for
the
lack
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
just
plain
bland
and
unpleasant
i
guess
if
youre
looking
for
a
substitute
of
a
cheap
horrible
brew
this
works
anywhooooo
avoid
this
can
overall
better
than
i
expected
the
aroma
was
the
high
light
of
this
tasting
experience
the
flavor
and
the
appearance
were
passable
but
a
little
diacetyl
would
have
helped
tried
it
out
of
the
can
not
so
good
could
not
even
finish
it
would
not
recommend
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
na
beer
st
pauli
na
ok
but
i
like
heavy
beers
like
kaliberi
wish
they
would
make
a
na
beer
kaliber
is
made
by
kaliber
should
be
a
good
beer
malta
is
a
good
na
beer
is
has
many
good
reviews
extremely
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
horrible
because
of
bad
taste
it
is
horrible
because
it
has
no
taste
i
was
curious
to
try
this
once
and
now
i
know
i
will
avoid
in
the
future
o
not
one
of
my
favorite
low
alcohol
beers
the
strange
chemicalmedicinal
quality
to
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
offputting
and
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
honey
addition
would
not
grab
another
one
of
these
this
was
my
only
option
when
deployed
and
has
a
special
place
in
my
memory
although
not
a
primary
choice
for
beer
because
of
the
lack
of
alcohol
i
would
recommend
for
any
designated
driver
or
for
a
fish
and
chips
lunch
when
alcohol
consumption
is
not
an
option
for
those
that
are
avoiding
alcohol
but
still
like
to
have
a
beer
im
glad
that
there
are
offerings
out
there
for
them
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
small
sampling
as
it
is
that
ive
had
due
to
the
nature
of
the
style
it
is
incredibly
light
and
has
a
very
weak
flavor
profile
there
is
enough
flavor
however
to
give
those
that
choose
this
style
an
inkling
that
theyre
drinking
a
beer
what
beer
drinkers
drink
when
their
not
drinkin
beer
i
reiterate
who
needs
alcohol
anyway
answer
from
earlier
everybody
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mineral
water
and
dusty
grain
the
taste
brings
in
some
fruity
funk
for
the
sake
of
it
but
that
just
makes
things
a
touch
less
palatable
frankly
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
if
you
want
such
a
nonalcoholic
option
for
a
beverage
just
drink
water
or
soda
or
something
its
just
not
worth
it
to
opt
for
this
shit
just
for
the
sake
of
saying
you
drank
something
that
sortakinda
had
the
vague
appearance
of
beer
from
the
green
and
silver
can
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
the
two
bigger
brothers
from
the
same
company
what
a
surprise
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
is
rather
watery
and
has
done
unusual
hints
of
honey
hate
to
rag
on
an
na
beer
because
the
fact
these
exist
and
are
available
for
those
who
cant
drink
because
of
health
self
control
or
driving
safe
reasons
is
awesome
and
i
applaud
it
but
this
is
a
terrible
na
beer
and
id
rather
just
have
water
if
i
have
to
drive
for
the
night
it
pours
from
the
bottle
an
entirely
flat
looking
yellow
wheat
color
with
literally
no
head
at
all
the
nose
is
sweet
and
extracty
corn
syrupy
almost
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
as
the
nose
very
little
redeeming
at
al
about
it
and
it
would
barely
pass
as
beer
to
me
in
a
blind
tasting
i
dont
hate
the
body
which
is
sort
of
medium
to
light
not
watery
as
i
expected
but
te
carbonation
just
isnt
there
i
try
to
keep
a
6er
of
na
around
for
soem
friends
of
mine
who
dont
partake
anymore
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
i
prefer
ever
single
na
ive
ever
tasted
to
this
one
how
can
a
beer
be
this
flat
and
bland
not
fair
to
the
sober
guys
probably
one
of
the
better
na
beers
but
then
whats
the
point
its
not
really
offensive
but
at
this
point
you
might
as
well
drink
a
soda
not
bad
for
the
style
though
o
it
is
what
it
is
however
it
was
more
tolerable
than
some
of
its
light
lager
counterparts
it
just
taste
more
like
flavored
carbonated
water
to
me
i
didnt
enjoy
anything
about
this
beer
but
graded
with
the
style
in
mind
someone
left
this
at
my
house
so
i
figure
ill
try
it
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
coded
bottle
date
this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
straw
like
color
with
a
short
lived
fizzy
large
bubbled
foamy
head
which
different
than
most
beers
the
smells
are
of
adjuncts
no
real
hop
presence
the
feel
is
thin
and
fizzy
the
taste
is
okay
for
what
it
is
not
my
type
of
beer
but
it
could
be
worse
like
most
other
popular
beers
overall
o
honestly
not
half
as
bad
as
some
terrible
macro
light
beers
ive
had
could
have
fooled
me
as
a
macro
light
lager
of
some
kind
that
said
id
never
reach
for
it
and
only
accept
it
as
a
courtesy
to
the
host
if
i
couldnt
drink
at
a
party
i
guess
i
could
find
worse
things
than
an
odouls
when
canned
it
doesnt
have
as
much
flavor
to
it
and
has
more
of
a
metallic
taste
bottles
are
easier
to
find
of
this
but
since
the
taste
has
since
improved
i
recommend
you
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
give
it
another
try
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
faint
hints
of
grain
taste
is
also
grains
a
touch
of
malt
actually
more
flavor
than
other
beers
of
this
style
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
i
will
be
in
no
rush
to
have
another
it
aint
the
worst
of
this
style
overall
this
was
my
first
low
alcohol
beer
and
my
expectations
were
somewhat
met
concerning
it
the
biggest
disappointment
was
the
smell
the
greatest
attribute
was
the
heavy
carbonation
which
successfully
served
as
a
helpful
reminder
that
you
were
drinking
a
beer
despite
its
low
alcohol
content
o
could
have
been
worse
decent
beverage
for
duty
driver
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
weak
white
head
smell
is
really
absent
high
carbonation
smell
light
some
barley
malt
really
watery
mouthfeel
good
for
a
thirstquencher
it
has
a
pleasent
apsect
it
is
my
first
low
alcohol
beer
it
is
ideal
for
people
that
is
trying
to
lower
calories
or
alcoholic
intake
overall
above
average
when
it
comes
to
low
alcohol
beers
pours
a
light
fizzy
yellow
color
w
a
sliver
of
a
white
head
looks
like
soda
to
me
nose
is
corn
grain
and
malt
very
weak
and
really
not
much
there
taste
is
mainly
grain
with
weak
malt
very
weak
and
fairly
horrid
feel
is
undercarbonated
fizzy
and
horrible
aftertaste
ugh
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
anyone
try
this
unless
you
enjoy
the
style
o
this
wasnt
all
that
bad
do
a
blind
taste
test
with
this
and
a
number
of
beers
like
natty
light
and
i
bet
youd
be
surprised
how
close
it
is
dr
please
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
seltzer
water
the
body
has
the
consistency
of
lipton
iced
tea
the
carbonation
is
a
good
bit
prickly
when
the
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
after
the
beer
is
swallowed
a
slight
dryness
comes
out
during
the
aftertaste
its
a
very
pale
yellow
in
color
pours
a
decent
but
short
lived
white
fizzy
headtaste
is
crisp
clean
and
better
than
most
so
called
light
beers
good
for
when
youve
had
enough
of
the
real
thing
but
you
have
to
stay
til
closing
time
odoulls
is
very
mild
w
gentle
malt
influence
and
slight
seltzery
quality
from
the
high
carbonation
which
verges
almost
on
mineral
with
slight
spice
effect
from
the
prickly
bubbles
that
creates
a
numbing
effect
and
more
of
a
corn
pop
tinge
as
it
warms
w
very
dry
finish
overall
this
is
not
the
first
choice
of
beers
i
would
have
if
looking
for
an
nonalcoholic
but
it
was
a
good
beer
for
pairing
with
a
thick
burger
and
seasoned
fries
for
a
lowalcohol
beer
this
is
quite
nice
i
get
the
lownonalcohol
beer
thing
its
mostly
for
people
who
simply
cant
handle
alcohol
you
can
call
them
alcoholics
if
you
like
its
noble
and
very
much
a
lifeordeath
thing
for
them
to
stay
away
from
alcohol
its
the
light
beer
drinkers
that
are
fooling
themselves
in
any
case
this
is
not
terrible
ive
had
worse
5
lagers
thats
but
sure
but
still
theres
got
to
be
better
lownonalcohol
beer
out
there
than
odouls
ive
heard
the
germans
have
been
doing
some
okay
stuff
in
that
department
o
overall
shocked
at
this
beer
i
guess
if
you
cant
drink
beers
anymore
this
doesnt
taste
all
that
bad
ive
had
much
worse
lagers
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
this
isnt
too
bad
refreshing
and
very
similar
to
light
beers
also
shares
the
problems
of
light
beer
where
its
very
watery
but
thats
expected
id
recommend
this
if
you
had
to
get
beer
from
this
style
okay
not
too
bad
for
a
near
beer
and
better
than
many
full
abv
cousins
i
still
see
no
point
in
these
creations
i
am
one
who
drinks
beer
for
its
taste
while
many
nascar
beer
drinkers
do
so
to
fit
in
or
to
get
a
buzz
getting
that
buzz
relaxes
them
and
allows
them
to
fit
in
better
note
i
did
say
most
i
do
realize
some
people
like
the
taste
of
the
beers
advertised
on
stock
cars
everyone
has
their
own
taste
seriously
i
want
my
dollar
back
light
golden
straw
color
seems
to
be
very
carbonated
foamy
white
head
with
moderated
retention
smell
is
very
grainy
lots
of
corn
and
straw
and
a
bit
metallic
taste
like
a
cheap
mass
produced
beer
actually
this
taste
better
than
some
other
alcoholic
bmc
products
ive
had
sweet
corn
hops
barley
pulls
through
mouth
feel
seems
to
be
very
carbonated
and
kinda
watery
pretty
much
the
only
aspect
of
the
beer
that
needs
some
work
everything
else
is
typical
i
cant
remember
when
i
last
drank
a
na
beer
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
not
to
say
this
beer
is
good
or
anything
its
just
not
horrible
m
the
mouthfeel
is
malty
clean
sweet
at
times
a
malted
drink
water
with
some
heft
overall
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
but
it
isnt
a
complete
turnoff
to
the
world
of
alcoholfree
beer
taste
not
much
like
many
adjunct
lagers
bmc
i
get
a
stale
musky
grain
thing
damp
sweet
thankfully
not
all
that
strong
not
sure
why
you
would
drink
this
taste
hope
not
but
thats
what
it
is
i
guess
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
fizzy
with
carbonation
and
a
thin
layer
of
fizzy
bubbles
for
a
head
almost
nothing
in
the
smell
other
than
skunk
and
old
grain
husks
taste
is
of
stale
cheerios
marinated
in
old
bathwater
except
thinner
very
light
bodied
and
pretty
hard
to
choke
down
especially
when
you
remember
that
you
wont
get
drunk
at
all
by
drinking
this
so
it
wont
get
better
with
the
more
you
drink
my
dad
used
to
have
loads
of
this
crap
and
sharps
at
99
cent
in
the
singles
pile
figured
this
would
be
a
good
weekday
beer
boy
was
i
wrong
it
just
left
me
all
pissed
off
afterwards
i
wanted
to
try
this
honestly
i
expected
a
lot
worse
this
brew
wasnt
overly
tasteless
it
tasted
like
most
american
lagers
do
it
has
a
golden
yellow
color
has
the
flavor
of
a
regular
pale
lager
surprisingly
enough
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
choice
for
someone
who
cant
have
much
alcohol
for
me
though
i
wont
need
to
seek
this
out
again
unless
its
for
a
prank
on
someone
or
something
like
that
just
above
drinking
waterliquid
bread
the
cpj
this
is
how
i
amuse
myself
in
the
slow
moments
it
is
probably
a
good
thing
for
society
that
i
am
usually
kept
busy
my
pour
created
better
than
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
light
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
reminded
me
of
so
many
aals
that
i
have
reviewed
that
i
wondered
which
finest
natural
ingredients
were
used
at
least
no
unnatural
ingredients
like
plastic
right
minhas
or
should
i
say
the
cybermen
brewery
were
harmed
in
the
making
of
this
brew
mouthfeel
was
thin
not
quite
watery
but
mot
by
much
it
had
a
wheaty
corny
cereal
taste
in
the
mouth
to
the
point
that
i
thought
it
might
have
been
liquid
chex
mix
oh
man
this
was
so
boring
that
it
could
have
put
muzak
to
sleep
finish
woke
me
up
to
tell
me
that
it
was
leaving
what
a
snoozefest
thank
goodness
that
i
am
not
consigned
to
a
steady
diet
of
n
a
s
d
this
beer
is
not
bad
for
what
it
is
suppose
to
be
my
palate
though
after
first
sip
started
to
feel
this
weird
numbing
feeling
which
is
why
i
rated
it
as
low
as
i
did
not
a
beer
i
want
to
visit
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
at
least
once
d
i
can
imagine
worse
i
mean
its
not
much
worse
tasting
than
most
light
lagers
out
there
i
just
wouldnt
ever
drink
it
by
choice
this
was
my
first
nonalcoholic
beer
but
im
genuinely
impressed
with
how
much
it
was
unlike
regular
beers
in
the
american
adjunct
category
decent
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
amazing
but
pretty
normal
really
which
i
would
assume
for
this
style
is
very
good
i
would
have
another
one
why
not
its
not
offensive
at
all
pours
a
nasty
looking
piss
straw
yellow
with
a
white
head
and
lacing
that
isnt
present
smells
like
grain
and
a
little
corn
tastes
weak
with
a
little
corn
and
some
grain
mouthfeel
is
really
super
than
and
leaves
much
to
be
desired
drinkability
is
high
because
it
has
like
no
alcohol
it
gets
bonus
points
for
being
water
but
thats
about
it
it
was
actually
not
the
worst
tasting
of
the
group
at
all
i
asked
before
is
it
good
my
answer
not
really
while
it
tastes
like
beer
thats
because
it
should
after
all
why
try
marketing
a
beer
substitute
if
it
isnt
going
to
resemble
the
real
thing
odouls
might
compare
to
a
light
beer
in
flavor
but
even
then
its
pretty
weak
better
than
the
low
carb
beers
for
sure
but
i
have
to
believe
there
is
better
nonlow
alcohol
beers
out
there
than
this
definitely
not
something
i
want
to
drink
ever
again
i
would
rather
have
a
glass
of
water
than
this
odouls
pours
a
clear
light
straw
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
grainy
with
some
hints
of
cooked
corn
the
flavor
is
thin
and
watery
with
some
grainy
malt
flavor
this
is
my
first
low
alcohol
beer
and
overall
i
am
not
impressed
but
if
you
told
me
this
was
light
beer
i
would
probably
believe
you
crystal
clear
light
gold
colour
with
a
quickly
dissipating
cap
of
white
foam
a
thin
collar
is
supported
by
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
seems
highly
carbonated
and
there
was
a
bit
of
transient
lacing
strong
aroma
of
cooked
veggies
very
sulfury
quite
unpleasant
low
bitterness
with
a
sticky
malt
sweetness
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavour
beyond
sharp
mineral
notes
at
the
end
light
bodied
and
dry
watery
and
thin
with
lots
of
carbonation
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
wasnt
surprised
i
dont
ever
expect
to
have
this
again
i
wasnt
impressed
at
all
apart
from
its
initial
looks
even
though
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
bottle
was
skunked
i
couldnt
or
wouldnt
willingly
drink
this
again
its
too
bad
that
alcoholics
have
to
deal
with
this
sort
of
punishment
yugh
im
going
to
pour
this
out
and
grab
a
bigfoot
overall
a
perfect
beer
to
get
drunk
on
cough
cough
having
gotten
the
bad
out
of
the
way
ill
say
that
it
serves
in
what
it
is
designed
to
do
satisfy
a
taste
for
beer
when
its
inappropriate
to
be
drinking
alcohol
its
certainly
no
worse
than
the
domestic
macrobrews
that
so
many
swear
by
i
e
budweiser
mgd
etc
ill
buy
it
again
when
i
need
to
keep
my
wits
about
me
d
i
tried
to
review
this
beer
for
what
it
is
a
light
beer
with
very
little
alcohol
i
was
not
expecting
a
huge
complex
beer
or
something
that
would
knock
my
socks
off
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
to
knock
back
a
few
of
them
in
a
sitting
without
getting
a
buzz
d
it
was
drinkable
and
i
thank
god
that
time
has
passed
and
now
can
fully
enjoy
real
beers
not
bad
at
all
looks
dull
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
slugging
a
few
brews
with
zero
chance
of
a
buzz
this
isnt
a
bad
call
i
see
this
beers
better
qualities
it
does
have
some
flavor
and
it
does
do
some
characteristics
good
i
cant
imagine
its
easy
but
i
really
dont
know
so
i
could
be
wrong
to
make
a
na
beer
i
see
this
brew
for
what
it
is
i
dont
like
it
but
it
is
what
it
is
d
with
the
age
on
this
thing
i
was
expecting
to
be
close
to
a
barf
no
joke
but
its
not
even
bad
per
se
it
cant
be
bad
when
there
is
nothing
there
to
be
bad
really
its
totally
devoid
of
any
flavor
god
damn
prohibition
must
have
been
awful
with
legal
beer
like
this
pours
a
very
light
color
with
a
not
bad
white
head
the
smell
is
somewhat
earthy
but
not
in
a
good
waymore
in
the
way
of
an
old
basement
the
flavor
isnt
really
off
in
any
particular
wayperhaps
a
little
bit
of
cardboardbut
in
reality
there
just
isnt
much
there
mouthfeel
is
light
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
similar
to
seltzer
waterjust
not
much
about
it
that
would
keep
me
drinking
more
but
nothing
too
horrible
either
i
dont
think
this
is
a
brew
id
care
to
sample
much
more
than
this
one
time
i
feel
sorry
for
my
beautiful
wife
that
she
has
to
endure
this
as
a
beerstaple
for
the
next
five
and
half
months
due
to
our
expecting
a
baby
in
late
march
this
is
a
true
sacrifice
heres
where
this
beer
really
gets
crazy
though
the
freshness
date
is
september
08
this
beer
held
up
damn
well
considering
the
average
life
span
of
a
macro
is
a
little
more
than
three
months
maybe
it
got
better
with
age
yes
it
doesnt
get
you
drunk
but
aside
from
that
theres
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
guess
this
whole
time
i
have
actually
been
drinking
beer
mostly
because
it
tastes
good
typical
nose
of
raw
grain
and
with
no
negative
influences
touch
of
nondescript
vegetal
flavors
dont
deter
flavor
follows
suit
and
is
light
and
grainy
without
being
too
thin
feel
and
drink
are
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
though
there
seems
to
be
little
variation
in
that
regard
in
my
experience
like
many
of
the
style
this
is
best
consumed
directly
from
the
bottle
or
added
in
short
increments
to
a
glass
so
as
to
maintain
a
crisp
carbonation
drinkability
i
mean
its
not
the
worst
thing
ever
but
there
isnt
much
of
a
use
for
it
although
i
would
put
this
on
par
with
most
bmcs
slightly
more
drinkable
even
drinkability
while
this
might
not
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
i
just
kept
asking
myself
whats
the
point
dont
get
me
wrong
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
beer
but
if
its
not
getting
me
somewhat
buzzed
i
just
dont
see
the
point
for
pure
taste
this
isnt
bad
for
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
d
nah
not
even
memories
of
sharing
them
with
ol
grand
dad
could
make
this
one
one
that
i
would
buy
again
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
coat
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
not
so
bad
at
least
it
was
beerlike
there
was
some
malt
aroma
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
corn
the
taste
was
lightly
sweet
again
is
this
brewed
with
corn
and
a
very
low
malt
flavor
these
give
way
to
discernible
hops
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
overall
dry
with
very
light
body
and
low
carbonation
a
grain
sweetness
and
faint
hops
linger
in
the
finish
this
was
an
ok
beer
for
what
it
is
and
if
you
are
going
alcohol
free
it
would
be
an
ok
choice
i
cant
totally
pan
this
one
im
no
expert
on
near
beer
by
any
means
but
this
beer
met
my
expectations
and
served
as
a
fair
standin
for
the
real
thing
i
probably
will
buy
it
again
in
the
future
overall
one
of
the
better
nas
d
excellent
but
i
will
not
be
testing
its
drinkability
anytime
soon
conclusion
what
began
and
failed
after
about
a
month
as
a
lenten
exercise
has
now
led
me
to
drink
na
beer
a
couple
of
nights
during
the
week
to
save
calories
and
money
they
are
what
they
are
im
not
going
to
argue
that
na
beers
are
super
tasty
or
anything
because
even
the
best
are
mediocre
by
normal
standards
that
being
said
this
and
busch
na
are
about
the
only
ones
worth
drinking
eh
its
a
nonalcoholic
beer
what
do
you
expect
its
inoffensive
though
youd
pretty
much
have
to
drink
a
30
pack
just
to
get
drunk
if
thats
your
thing
then
by
all
means
do
it
this
pours
out
a
limpid
pale
pale
gold
color
with
no
head
the
nose
is
very
bland
a
touch
grainy
with
a
little
sulpheric
note
i
think
not
too
bad
of
a
flavor
actually
its
too
sweet
with
hardly
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
but
it
doesnt
taste
bad
the
way
some
some
nonalcohol
beers
do
very
bland
more
beery
than
keystone
light
dr
okay
its
not
flavorful
not
really
good
beer
just
a
light
weight
really
light
beer
when
i
want
a
beer
w
lunch
before
going
for
a
motorcycle
ride
a
harmless
selfdelusion
d
ok
for
what
it
is
not
much
going
on
im
not
really
ready
to
admit
that
this
is
a
beer
taste
is
completely
below
average
and
doesnt
have
any
special
characteristics
very
bland
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
a
subpar
smell
color
is
pale
and
mostly
unattractive
stay
away
from
this
one
as
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
this
ones
a
no
go
d
not
bad
for
an
na
pretty
much
bud
with
the
alcohol
zapped
out
of
it
m
d
it
could
ease
up
on
the
carbonation
a
little
though
it
does
have
a
fairly
decent
density
in
the
body
only
in
beer
do
i
ever
like
my
bodies
dense
its
a
reasonable
shot
though
the
rice
aromas
and
flavours
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
a
move
in
the
wrong
direction
when
trying
to
reproduce
the
flavours
of
beer
without
the
alcohol
content
drinking
something
that
hopes
to
reproduce
such
a
flavour
when
not
wanting
alcohol
always
seems
like
a
rather
unusual
idea
too
but
thats
just
me
it
was
ultimately
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
pour
it
down
the
toilet
by
any
means
i
just
dont
see
myself
going
after
it
again
any
time
soon
pours
a
cleanclear
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
little
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
grainyricey
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
grainyricey
light
body
not
drinkable
not
too
much
to
this
brew
not
recommended
i
guess
some
people
like
this
brew
but
not
me
i
admit
i
was
always
curious
about
what
a
na
beer
tasted
like
but
i
only
picked
this
up
at
my
dads
request
comes
in
a
green
bottle
and
pours
like
golden
and
thin
with
minimal
head
like
so
many
of
the
classics
very
drinkable
and
similar
in
taste
to
some
of
the
classics
as
well
except
for
one
detail
the
smell
this
is
the
stinkiest
beer
ive
ever
had
as
soon
as
i
twisted
off
the
cap
the
smell
actually
came
and
found
me
ive
heard
of
certain
beers
smelling
skunky

the

52what
an
odd
experience
this
na
beer
is
absolutly
the
cleanest
going
down
the
throat
of
any
beer
ive
had
there
is
no
bite
but
i
dont
scaliasuxmar

like
the
bottom
of
a

rotting

the
taste
is
just
beareable
with
stinging

fusels
damn
glad
to
get
this
style
out
of
the
way
charlesdarwinnov

its
not
bad
actually
then
drink
fruit
juice
but
im
sure
thats
how
the
brewers
intended
a
na
beer
to
be
so
id
have
to
say
it
has
a
good
balance
surprisingly
smooth
mouthfeel
as
well
medium
carbonation
and
a
thin
body
that
finishes
mostly
clean
with
a
touch
of
dry
eurohops
highly
drinkable
and
nails
the
style

i

buddies
meeting
nearly
flavorless
making
this
not
very
pleasant
its
possible
that
i
would
have
another
one
so
extra
points
there
taste
seems
sometimes
nonexistent
but
it
tastes
similar
to
an
average
macro
im
not

actually
didnt
buy
this
with
any
intention
of
drinking
more
than
a
single
bottle
of
the
six
pack
i
buy
nonalcoholics
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
cooking
with
them
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
glass
it
poured
a
large
white
creamy
head
with
smallmedium
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
with
carbonation
and
the
hue
was
yellow
there
was
good
lacing
with
this
beer
the
flavor
was
relatively
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
thin
sickly
pale
gold
translucent
minimal
animation
underdeveloped
soapy
white
head
no
retention
no
lace
the
nose
is
uninviting
husky
grainy
funky
smells
like
science
diet
dog
food
rather
flavorless
husky
grainy
with
a
minimal
influence
of
hops
or
malt
a
whisper
of
cooked
vegetables
quick
finish
empty
no
enjoyment
in
drinking
this
one
moderate
carbonation
mediumlight
body
this
part
of
odouls
is
decent
if
you
want
an
na
try
a
clausthaler
premium
and
if
youre
just
thirsty
drink
water
i
really
dont
understand
the
point
of
nonalcoholic
brew
but
ill
try
anything
so
here
goes
actually
poured
a
nicer
colour
than
expected
still
piss
yellow
all
the
same
but
slightly
deeper
than
the
standard
ab
piss
yellow
thats
the
only
thing
going
for
this
one
which
isnt
very
impressive
the
green
bottle
brought
the
exoected
skunky
flavouring
which
prevailed
over
any
other
tastes
here
which
were
pretty
much
nonexistant
save
for
a
slight
hint
of
maltiness
every
now
and
again
watery
watery
watery
not
very
enjoyable
kinda
like
bad
beer
flavoured
seltzer
water
not
a
bad
effort
for
a
nonacoholic
beer
of
course
there
is
some
acohol
but
not
much
certainly
not
enough
to
add
any
flavor
or
body
overtone
the
appearance
is
not
that
bad
nor
is
the
malty
nose
the
flavor
is
actually
btb
but
not
by
much
an
ok
offering
if
youve
got
to
have
beer
but
cant
have
the
alcohol
but
in
all
honesty
whats
the
point
light
golden
color
with
sparkling
clarity
a
small
white
head
lively
streams
of
carbonation
excellent
lace
the
appearance
is
absolutely
correct
for
a
light
american
lager
solid
malt
aroma
with
moderate
hop
notes
taste
begins
with
solid
grain
flavors
and
much
less
of
the
sticky
sweetness
often
found
in
na
beers
carbonation
stings
slightly
to
good
effect
the
hops
that
are
present
in
the
aroma
are
largely
absent
from
the
taste
save
for
perhaps
a
whisper
finish
is
clean
and
dry
the
mouth
feel
is
fairly
good
considering
that
this
is
a
nonalcoholic
beer
its
a
remarkably
good
effort
pours
dry
like
a
typical
na
brew
decent
head
with
lacing
abound
taste
is
dry
and
smooth
malt
is
there
mostly
from
grains
and
in
particular
corn
this
a
decent
example
of
the
type
i
would
try
this
again
for
a
good
na
american
lager
best
if
served
ice
cold
ive
got
to
hand
it
to
anheuserbusch
for
brewing
one
of
the
most
authentic
tasting
nas
of
course
it
still
tastes
like
a
bland
american
lager
but
what
do
you
expect
on
the
other
hand
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
as
not
having
alcohol
it
doesnt
have
that
dull
and
sticky
malt
character
that
many
nas
have
or
should
i
say
it
has
it
to
a
lesser
extent
where
its
not
continually
noticed
and
distracting
its
got
a
nice
golden
appearance
with
a
short
and
creamy
brightwhite
head
that
immediately
drops
to
a
thin
collar
that
of
course
also
happens
with
most
standard
american
lagers
the
aroma
expresses
some
nonalcohol
character
with
a
starchy
semisweet
grainy
note
thats
decidedly
different
than
a
regular
beer
once
you
get
past
that
difference
however
its
actually
fairly
nice
there
are
no
hops
present
but
again
we
are
talking
american
lager
here
the
body
is
light
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
its
lightly
crisp
and
then
mildly
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
as
might
be
expected
from
the
aroma
with
a
softly
sweet
grainy
malt
thats
wellbalanced
by
a
mild
underlying
hop
bitterness
it
finishes
drying
with
some
residual
maltiness
very
nicely
done
and
highly
recommended
amongst
nas
of
this
style
i
finally
broke
down
and
tried
one
of
these
they
were
giving
away
at
the
convention
center
in
anaheim
during
a
reception
any
curiosity
i
had
is
now
sated
ill
get
more
wine
instead
next
time
i
have
the
choice
how
could
anyone
like
this
by
definition
this
is
not
really
even
beer
big
full
head
with
gold
color
looks
like
a
typical
am
lager
mostly
sweet
water
aroma
with
some
tinninessmetalic
qualities
with
some
malt
taste
is
nondistinct
yet
somehow
not
excessively
watery
little
less
of
sweet
water
taste
than
many
some
metalic
tones
seems
a
little
less
thin
that
many
with
a
satifactory
carbonation
other
than
being
a
na
there
is
nothing
terrifically
wrong
with
this
itll
do
if
a
na
is
required
but
the
european
ones
are
generally
better
this
may
be
the
ugliest
beer
ive
ever
come
across
it
was
so
pale
yellow
it
almost
looked
a
bit
gray
very
strange
that
aside
it
had
a
thin
grainy
aroma
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
i
was
really
impressed
because
ab
gave
their
na
beer
a
hop
aroma
that
their
regular
beers
lack
the
beer
had
a
macro
supercarbonation
thin
mouthfeel
it
had
only
a
very
faint
malt
tase
the
other
flavor
aroma
struck
me
as
odd
it
could
only
be
percieved
by
retronasally
it
was
a
very
faint
soft
fruit
it
reminded
me
of
diet
snapple
peach
iced
tea
very
strange
light
straw
with
slight
head
and
lace
slight
sweet
aroma
with
dextrin
cooked
grain
nose
light
and
slightly
fizzy
somewhat
skunky
taste
like
beer
that
hasnt
had
enough
time
to
ferment
duh
its
a
na
finishes
slightly
cabbagy
still
not
bad
for
a
na
they
claim
there
is
no
alcohol
but
there
is
they
claim
it
is
a
beer
but
i
have
my
doubts
is
this
brewed
for
12
step
programs
or
for
giving
to
people
you
dont
want
at
your
party
i
tried
it
and
found
it
bland
tasteless
i
think
this
is
the
water
they
use
to
wash
out
the
brewing
barrels
odouls
is
a
slight
of
everything
brew
no
yummy
malt
no
well
bittered
hops
bite
just
a
lot
of
gas
carbonation
and
if
you
ask
me
its
a
slightly
boring
brew
for
what
it
is
it
is
tolerable
drank
as
a
joke
tastes
like
dirty
water
pours
to
a
generous
white
head
and
light
amber
color
aroma
is
weak
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
a
watered
down
but
not
unpleasant
sweet
malt
and
touch
of
hops
and
a
nice
seltzer
finish
these
nas
are
not
going
to
taste
like
real
beer
because
alcohol
is
the
glue
that
holds
all
the
flavors
together
but
this
is
pretty
damn
close
overall
i
have
tried
four
na
beers
now
as
i
vowed
to
abstain
from
regular
alcohol
and
this
one
is
my
favorite
thus
far
clausthaler
is
too
bitter
and
metallic
kaliber
is
way
to
sweet
and
funky
coors
na
tastes
just
like
coors
and
this
tastes
like
a
soft
nut
brown
ale
with
cream
soda
its
not
too
sweet
but
sweeter
than
normal
beer
with
enough
malt
to
remind
you
this
isnt
soda
if
my
choices
were
the
same
again
bud
bud
light
or
odouls
amber
id
probably
opt
for
a
water
fountain
but
if
i
had
to
have
a
beer
from
those
choices
this
would
be
the
one
not
horrible
enough
said
can
o
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
chemical
or
off
flavors
you
would
normally
expect
from
a
low
alcohol
beer
but
seems
to
taste
more
like
a
malty
version
of
a
cream
soda
compared
to
a
beer
got
a
single
bottle
on
a
lark
wow
not
twist
off
amber
in
color
as
advertised
with
big
ol
bubbles
in
the
clear
body
thats
not
barley
i
smell
is
it
sweet
bland
grain
no
hop
presence
smells
challenging
tastes
less
offensive
than
it
smells
so
id
actually
recommend
swigging
this
from
the
bottle
wait
dont
still
just
a
faint
reminder
of
beer
with
mild
hints
of
honey
sweet
is
the
prominent
flavor
finishing
with
weird
bitterness
this
would
be
my
first
drainpour
if
i
werent
such
a
glutton
for
punishment
im
doing
this
dammit
but
never
again
this
comes
out
more
like
a
caramel
soda
than
a
beer
even
for
na
brew
it
really
doesnt
offer
much
and
its
just
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
o
not
much
going
on
here
with
this
beer
very
light
aromas
and
flavors
along
with
a
somewhat
watery
body
overall
pretty
on
par
with
bmc
when
it
comes
to
the
nose
and
taste
nice
body
but
a
failure
in
overall
appearance
mouthfeel
is
just
a
failure
drinkability
is
pointless
because
of
all
this
it
is
beneath
bmc
overall
poor
beer
the
only
reason
to
try
this
is
if
you
are
a
ticker
and
i
am
i
can
go
back
to
regular
beer
now
this
style
designation
has
been
had
and
reviewed
o
bearing
in
mind
the
style
its
the
best
sample
of
the
style
ive
tried
but
its
certainly
not
something
many
would
enjoy
if
im
the
dd
ill
drink
this
for
fun
but
apart
from
that
id
pass
really
ive
gotten
to
this
level
of
ticking
im
ashamed
of
myself
im
about
to
drink
a
big
bb
aged
stout
i
swear
overall
im
glad
this
was
a
gift
after
i
gifted
this
person
a
rochefort
10
its
amber
brilliant
clarity
and
looks
still
after
the
quick
dissipation
of
loose
light
cream
foam
smells
sweet
with
some
beefy
character
and
a
little
tea
quality
taste
is
metallic
with
oxidized
grains
and
some
oversteeped
red
tea
thin
bodied
with
low
carb
and
a
astringently
abrasive
finish
no
likey
meh
who
needs
alcohol
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
warm
lightlybuttered
bread
yup
thats
it
i
know
im
kinda
surprised
too
the
taste
is
grainier
like
less
polished
bread
with
a
touch
of
vague
fruitiness
tossed
in
for
apparently
good
measure
then
everything
is
watered
down
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
im
not
sure
why
they
bothered
to
take
out
the
alcohol
here
except
to
save
the
company
from
being
derided
for
releasing
a
really
crappy
beer
that
may
actually
be
able
to
eventually
get
you
drunk
this
stuff
on
the
other
hand
is
purposeless
the
odd
metallic
notes
ruined
any
chance
for
this
one
theres
a
nice
attempt
at
a
malt
presence
but
its
sweet
and
there
are
no
hops
for
balance
this
was
only
89
for
a
single
i
bought
it
for
this
review
i
wont
be
buying
another
one
o
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
fairly
decent
beer
for
the
style
worth
a
try
let
this
be
a
lesson
why
alcoholism
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
overall
its
not
bad
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
ive
had
a
few
and
none
of
them
are
great
of
course
but
they
can
be
drinkable
at
least
this
one
is
about
average
o
an
adequate
example
for
the
nonalcohol
drinker
though
is
a
touch
to
sweet
to
indulge
in
multiples
a
clean
brew
a
bit
light
and
watery
at
times
but
is
to
be
expected
per
nonalcohol
styles
better
then
anticipated
but
certainly
not
a
substitute
thin
watery
not
much
carbonation
just
an
abomination
how
does
anybody
drink
this
as
anything
but
morbid
curiosity
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
labs
i
prefer
it
out
of
the
bottle
versus
a
glass
and
this
may
be
crazy
but
its
better
as
it
warms
a
little
if
you
like
beer
but
not
alcohol
or
if
you
like
alcohol
too
much
this
is
a
very
good
better
next
to
clausthaler
this
may
be
the
best
wow
the
crack
was
literally
explosive
on
this
gem
man
i
had
liquid
foaming
everywhere
and
fortunately
a
decanting
glass
was
readytohand
the
overlyfast
glug
produced
a
fingerandahalf
of
tawny
head
with
not
only
decent
retention
but
the
lacing
was
both
quick
to
appear
and
very
pretty
the
color
was
a
coppery
reddishamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
had
a
unique
quality
like
roasting
peanuts
or
chestnuts
it
had
a
roasted
malt
quality
not
generally
found
in
an
amber
but
usually
in
a
darker
beer
mouthfeel
was
actually
ending
to
full
and
the
taste
was
very
malty
which
is
not
my
bag
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
more
tasty
than
other
labs
in
my
memory
finish
was
biscuity
and
frankly
reminiscent
of
fat
tire
i
know
that
i
will
be
dunned
for
saying
so
but
this
was
a
fairly
worthwhile
beer
for
the
style
i
would
definitely
use
some
cooler
space
for
my
n
a
lab
friends
and
maybe
even
for
me
to
take
the
edge
off
its
an
amberred
in
color
trying
to
replicate
the
irish
red
style
pours
a
decent
but
short
lived
white
fizzy
headtaste
is
crisp
clean
and
better
than
most
so
called
light
beers
good
for
when
youve
had
enough
of
the
real
thing
but
you
have
to
stay
til
closing
time
the
taste
is
better
than
i
expected
based
on
previous
reviews
and
having
sampled
the
premium
odouls
recently
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
flavor
of
the
malt
with
some
toasted
and
bready
malt
flavors
which
have
a
slight
accent
of
caramel
malt
which
gives
a
mild
nuttiness
as
it
finishes
i
am
not
a
fan
of
na
beers
but
if
i
had
to
choose
this
is
the
one
that
best
emulates
a
regular
beer
so
i
consider
it
pretty
good
based
on
the
style
it
has
a
malt
flavor
which
is
more
than
most
have
to
offer
i
probably
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
should
have
but
when
reviewing
the
wasteland
of
nonalcoholic
beers
i
have
to
place
this
one
near
the
top
of
the
list
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
no
visible
freshness
date
into
a
pint
glass
darkorange
clear
color
with
minor
carbonation
streams
thin
fizzy
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
tiny
ring
and
no
lace
nose
of
malt
diacetyl
and
buttery
toast
taste
is
all
malty
with
little
else
other
than
perhaps
tap
water
slightly
bitter
finish
mouth
is
thin
and
watery
with
no
carbonation
evident
overall
while
it
looks
ok
initially
this
beer
devolves
into
what
amounts
to
a
glass
of
brownish
maltflavored
water
might
be
more
tolerable
when
swigged
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
should
just
advertise
itself
as
a
kvass
for
the
american
palate
sweet
and
carbonated
lightly
caramely
can
i
pick
out
many
identifiers
that
would
make
me
believe
that
this
is
a
beer
not
really
if
i
couldnt
drink
beer
anymore
i
wouldnt
drink
this
this
is
no
substitute
for
even
a
macro
lager
tastes
fake
and
on
e
dimensional
overall
not
a
beer
i
will
ever
buy
i
simply
cant
get
passed
the
fact
that
it
has
no
alcohol
other
than
that
it
is
very
pain
and
one
dimensional
i
did
not
finish
the
12oz
bottle
15
overall
not
too
bad
but
the
watery
malt
gets
old
and
this
beer
just
doesnt
cut
it
overall
have
to
be
honest
this
is
my
first
na
beer
and
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
enjoyed
it
not
sure
when
ill
be
having
again
but
will
definitely
say
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
lowalcohol
beer
overall
well
it
is
actually
better
than
the
lightest
of
the
light
beers
not
much
else
i
can
say
o
d
easy
unenjoyable
this
one
i
think
is
better
than
the
lager
version
they
make
just
just
a
little
bit
more
to
it
i
suppose
its
just
the
difference
in
using
the
roasted
malts
over
a
lighter
kind
what
else
can
be
said
about
this
brew
its
at
least
got
a
nice
color
to
it
poured
into
a
lost
abbey
sinners
glass
a
pretty
reddish
amber
with
a
good
amount
of
white
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
but
leave
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
honestly
not
bad
looking
there
is
almost
no
aroma
though
some
sweet
malts
but
nothing
else
going
on
a
few
sips
of
the
sweet
maltiness
are
quite
enough
for
me
its
not
awful
honestly
its
way
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
its
certainly
not
good
decent
mouthfeel
and
overall
better
than
i
was
expecting
pours
a
cleanclear
amber
color
some
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
and
grainy
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
not
much
going
on
here
light
body
not
drinkable
a
drain
pour
it
looks
and
smells
pretty
good
but
the
body
is
of
course
very
thin
with
nary
a
hint
of
mouthfeel
at
least
its
drinkable
i
get
the
closetonilalcohol
idea
for
beer
but
why
the
taste
and
body
has
to
suffer
so
much
i
have
to
wonder
and
another
thing
this
thing
still
has
90
calories
cripes
i
cant
believe
that
im
suggesting
that
one
should
opt
for
a
coors
light
or
michelob
ultra
in
its
place
poured
a
dull
straw
yellow
with
a
big
white
fizzy
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
but
the
fizzy
yellow
water
type
no
lace
the
smell
was
very
faint
if
there
at
all
what
i
could
pick
up
was
maybe
a
hay
or
wheat
smell
again
very
very
faint
and
hardly
there
at
all
the
taste
was
very
light
and
non
descript
but
that
is
about
what
one
would
expect
from
a
light
lager
a
light
grain
just
enough
of
a
taste
to
know
i
was
not
drinking
water
would
be
the
best
way
to
describe
it
decent
feel
again
just
the
cold
well
carbonated
crisp
and
a
clean
finish
no
aftertaste
overall
this
was
totally
forgettable
as
i
imagined
it
would
be
d
well
there
is
simply
nothing
horrible
about
this
beer
but
nothing
good
either
this
will
be
my
first
and
last
na
beer
for
sure
d
this
is
my
first
nonalcoholic
beer
but
ive
actually
had
alcoholic
beers
that
taste
worse
than
this
still
this
is
by
no
means
something
i
would
like
to
drink
again
pours
a
medium
amber
color
without
head
or
lacing
nose
brings
forth
some
light
grain
somewhat
of
a
grain
husk
nose
taste
confirms
this
with
some
general
bread
flavors
feel
is
light
with
too
much
carbonation
drinks
much
like
the
overall
experiencein
an
unimpressive
manner
conclusion
i
have
had
ultralow
abv
beers
before
that
were
actually
pretty
good
this
beer
is
sad
enough
said
on
to
better
things
there
isnt
anything
here
that
would
make
me
want
to
buy
it
again
but
for
anyone
who
is
in
search
of
a
good
na
beer
this
one
has
to
be
at
least
a
decent
place
to
start
mouthfeel
indicates
that
the
beer
is
much
thinner
than
its
appearance
becomes
watery
loses
any
wood
and
malt
feel
it
had
no
hops
at
any
point
cant
stand
to
finish
even
one
and
cant
believe
the
price
of
this
d
i
suppose
there
is
a
point
for
some
to
drink
nonalcoholic
beer
but
i
just
dont
see
it
id
rather
drink
a
soda
if
i
wanted
some
empty
calories
because
at
least
that
tastes
good
d
overall
i
would
recommend
avoiding
this
one
the
regular
odouls
is
much
more
palatable
compared
to
the
amber
d
i
guess
if
youre
forced
to
drink
a
na
beer
this
may
be
a
good
one
im
not
one
that
is
willing
to
sacrifice
taste
just
to
pretend
to
drink
a
beer
though
i
would
rather
drink
water
or
soda
if
im
a
dd
oh
man
this
is
awful
stuff
sourish
minerals
all
across
the
tongue
with
notes
of
overcooked
frozen
vegetables
like
bad
mineral
water
no
traces
of
the
labeltouted
tworow
and
specialty
caramel
malts
or
hops
of
any
sort
body
is
not
as
thin
as
one
might
think
for
a
0
5
abv
and
has
some
decent
creaminess
to
the
carbonation
but
the
offflavors
and
sour
crispness
are
equal
parts
distracting
and
disgusting
my
excuses
i
guess
i
was
curious
and
the
price
was
right
after
all
this
is
my
first
low
alcohol
beer
review
never
again
though
i
learned
my
lesson
the
label
reads
rich
flavorful
but
i
beg
to
differ
a
little
ashamed
im
praising
an
ab
product
but
hey
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
aint
bad
for
that
drinkability
this
wasnt
absolutely
horrible
or
offensive
but
with
these
low
alcohol
beers
i
just
have
to
ask
myself
whats
the
point
d
one
was
enough
yeah
i
ticked
the
style
waddya
want
me
to
say
id
prefer
my
beer
with
booze
in
it
have
a
few
cans
of
this
left
over
from
a
friend
poured
into
a
glass
this
is
a
light
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
was
here
then
gone
the
aroma
was
mild
with
some
hints
of
malt
the
taste
was
very
metallic
and
watery
at
the
same
time
there
was
not
much
taste
of
malt
and
maybe
a
syrupy
sweetness
that
was
out
right
gross
na
is
not
for
me
definitely
not
as
bad
as
the
rap
it
gets
here
i
wonder
if
you
can
legally
drink
it
while
driving
avoid
unless
you
absolutely
must
drink
a
na
beer
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
some
na
beers
but
not
enough
homever
i
cant
give
a
good
calification
to
a
nonalcoholic
beer
not
quite
the
worst
thing
but
generally
quite
unpleasant
dr
actually
tasted
pretty
okay
at
first
but
by
the
time
i
finished
not
so
much
i
can
drink
a
beer
kind
of
without
screwing
up
the
numbers
in
turbo
tax
ill
have
another
when
i
forget
how
the
first
one
tasted
i
think
its
jes
fine
drinkability
light
bodied
not
so
unpleasant
this
is
fairly
drinkable
2
problems
1
too
expensive
to
justify
and
2
who
the
hell
would
drink
this
in
large
quantities
unless
you
were
on
a
postatkins
carbbinge
d
and
this
is
different
from
regular
odouls
because
i
stand
by
my
initial
statement
passable
but
not
worth
a
revisit
i
think
this
is
odouls
with
a
bit
of
red
food
coloring
it
pours
amber
and
has
a
short
lived
fizzy
head
the
body
is
light
and
again
a
bit
fizzy
not
much
flavor
here
just
some
light
grains
the
nose
is
like
old
cut
grass
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
again
actually
im
sure
of
it
the
drinkability
is
fairly
low
sure
at
5
abv
its
sessionable
haha
but
its
just
not
enticing
to
drink
awful
purely
awful
i
thought
id
try
this
style
just
to
see
if
it
was
worth
the
while
im
glad
i
did
now
i
know
to
stick
with
regular
beer
or
to
get
a
coke
d
i
get
that
this
is
a
nonalcoholic
beer
but
when
it
repeatedly
claims
to
be
rich
and
flavorful
i
expected
much
more
this
has
always
been
one
of
those
creations
i
just
dont
get
its
similar
to
decaf
coffee
in
the
way
it
attempts
to
alter
a
beverages
bad
traits
to
make
it
accessible
to
someone
who
might
not
be
able
to
enjoy
it
otherwise
frankly
it
comes
off
as
a
poor
representation
of
any
style
let
alone
an
amber
and
hence
has
low
drinkability
for
me
glad
i
suppose
to
have
tried
this
but
id
pass
if
offered
another
even
for
free
i
feel
that
nearly
everyone
who
rates
a
na
has
no
clue
no
one
seems
to
realize
the
difference
between
a
regular
beer
and
a
beer
brewed
specifically
to
be
alcohol
free
or
close
to
it
i
sometimes
have
to
drink
nas
due
to
driving
so
i
actually
try
to
enjoy
them
and
more
so
appreciate
them
for
what
they
offer
now
that
i
have
that
semi
rant
over
pours
a
medium
brown
colour
with
a
low
medium
head
smell
is
of
older
malts
and
a
strange
maple
syrup
hybrid
taste
is
kinda
pleasant
similar
to
shiner
bock
but
not
as
off
putting
a
surprise
actually
better
than
most
imported
na
beers
and
easily
one
of
the
more
drinkable
american
na
beers
regular
odouls
might
be
crap
but
this
at
least
has
some
hope
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
thin
lace
of
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
completely
smells
like
a
macro
lager
except
with
a
little
more
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
quite
surprising
i
have
to
give
it
a
five
because
even
though
it
doesnt
have
as
much
flavor
as
a
beer
with
normal
level
of
alcohol
you
cant
get
more
flavor
out
of
a
low
alcohol
beer
than
this
its
malty
and
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
high
carbonated
and
crisp
i
would
give
this
a
higher
drinkability
rating
but
you
obvious
cant
get
any
buzz
out
of
this
d
if
you
really
need
to
avoid
alcohol
then
i
guess
this
isnt
terrible
but
your
better
off
just
drinking
half
of
a
real
beer
had
this
at
a
neighbors
house
when
nothing
else
was
available
figured
it
would
be
interesting
i
have
had
a
number
of
these
0
5
beers
and
some
i
like
fine
once
you
get
over
the
fact
that
they
are
never
much
like
any
real
beer
i
call
them
by
the
old
fashioned
term
cereal
beverage
anway
this
one
looked
pretty
good
with
a
fairly
dark
golden
brown
color
a
big
frothy
white
head
and
even
a
bit
of
lacing
on
my
mug
the
aroma
was
ok
too
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
wheat
clean
but
the
taste
was
far
below
some
of
the
imported
ones
i
have
generally
liked
like
haake
beck
st
paulis
and
clausthaler
the
immediate
impression
is
with
how
thin
and
weak
flavored
this
feels
and
tastes
it
is
well
carbonated
very
sprite
and
as
a
result
can
be
called
a
refreshing
drink
perhaps
but
the
flavor
implied
by
the
aroma
is
quickly
lost
in
a
peppery
and
watery
drink
that
has
a
metallic
overtone
its
very
thin
and
just
a
hint
of
some
wheat
here
i
thought
the
amber
might
hold
some
promise
but
dont
bother
with
this
when
there
are
much
better
choices
for
the
nolow
alcohol
options
sure
you
could
drink
plenty
of
these
like
any
other
of
its
kind
but
why
would
you
handy
in
the
desert
i
suppose
d
since
it
is
so
low
in
alcohol
it
can
be
drunk
just
like
water
i
had
no
problems
drinking
it
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
example
of
a
low
alcohol
beer
im
actually
impressed
well
done
and
cheers
to
anheuserbusch
for
making
a
na
beer
that
can
be
found
in
almost
any
bar
in
the
world
there
are
a
lot
of
temporarily
and
nontemporarily
dry
folks
out
there
who
still
like
to
have
a
beer
or
two
drinkability
i
felt
like
a
dork
buying
this
while
this
is
better
than
odouls
regular
its
certainly
not
good
possibly
one
of
the
better
beers
in
its
category
but
the
category
is
rather
uninspired
in
exploring
the
world
of
na
beers
ive
found
very
few
beers
that
satisfied
me
this
one
is
a
step
up
from
the
lifeless
regular
odouls
but
not
a
very
big
step
the
mediumdark
amber
color
is
a
pleasant
greeting
but
its
all
downhill
from
there
the
fizzy
offwhite
head
quickly
disipates
the
smell
is
faint
grainy
and
a
little
metallic
with
absolutely
no
hops
the
flavor
is
bland
with
a
caramel
sweetness
that
is
at
first
not
too
shabby
but
quickly
gets
old
on
the
tastebuds
and
the
worst
is
the
mouthfeel
just
lifeless
not
worth
getting
again
bottle

a
short
lived
off
white

zero
lace
the
aromas
are
faint
and
it
smells
like
other
na
beers
pretty
cardboardey
but
perhaps
due
to
the
amber
designation
they
did
use
some
decent
malting
here
which
is
detectable
in
the
aroma
caramel
and
toffee
nuances
as
well
flavour
is
bland
mild
sweet

with
some

spritzy
finish
completely
forgettable
but
its
the
official
na
beer
of
the
pga
thanks
for
the
bottle
len
its
probably
not
something
id
ever
buy
odouls
amber
wins
na
shootout
with
blanks
ii
by
a
mile
and
wins
it
essentially
by
default
like
a
politician
who
refuses
to
state
his
positions
prior
to
an
election
so
as
to
not
offend
potential
voters
amber
doesnt
provide
much
of
any
flavor
so
as
to
be
palatable
to
those
brave
souls
who
are
forced
to
drink
it
no
one
gladly
drinks
this
stuff
do
they
if
youre
the
designated
driver
or
you
find
yourself
in
a
situation
in
which
you
want
a
na
i
suggest
picking
the
regular
odouls
its
not
really
good
but
better
than
this
they
tried
something
different
that
just
doesnt
work
scores
based
on
na
standards
and
still
low
even
for
style
thin
and
bland
eh
just
like
every
other
low
alcohol
beer
ive
had
this
isnt
very
appealing
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
it
to
the
molson
and
labatt
offerings
though
drinkability
was
average
but
seeing
as
im
a
big
time
moocher
and
seeing
as
its
what
my
friends
have
i
will
most
likely
be
having
another
very
soon
meh
not
entirely
terrible
an
above
average
representative
of
the
style
makes
a
nice
substitute
for
the
real
thing
when
the
need
arises
other
than
that
dont
go
for
it
poured
a
mediumamber
color
with
initial
white
puffy
head
that
was
quickly
gone
smell
is
mostly
a
sweetness
that
is
not
especialyl
enjoyable
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
typical
lowalcohol
notes
finished
with
a
not
pleasant
aftertaste
there
are
acceptable
nas
out
there
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
sweet
and
fake
tasting
the
hops
that
were
barely
there
in
the
nose
are
completely
gone
light
and
fluffy
drain
pour
i
wanted
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
but
i
remembered
i
had
to
work
in
the
early
morning
so
i
got
some
low
alcoholic
beer
this
beer
poors
a
brownred
hue
with
a
small
but
stoic
frothy
head
the
taste
is
pretty
okay
slightly
sweet
caramel
malts
but
not
very
hoppy
it
is
smooth
but
it
doesnt
exactly
sit
down
the
most
negative
parts
of
this
beer
include
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
the
smell
is
pretty
bland
not
giving
any
info
on
the
beer
itself
and
the
mouthfeel
seems
watered
down
after
witnessing
the
color
of
the
beer
typical
of
an
ab
product
on
the
whole
it
is
probably
the
best
ab
product
out
there
in
my
opinion
that
i
have
tried
so
far
it
was
not
very
different
from
the
odouls
one
but
was
a
little
more
dissapointed
with
the
flavor
is
alittle
heavier
and
it
makes
it
a
little
more
annoying
perhaps
the
colour
is
more
green
than
ambar
but
anyway
it
is
yellow
after
all
the
aroma
is
proper
for
a
beer
like
this
and
maybe
with
some
limes
would
be
better
like
the
beers
of
anheuser
busch
had
an
abuse
of
adjoincts
in
rice
an
other
grains
poor
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
no
comments
inappearance
taste
and
drinkability
smell
a
little
hops
and
malt
rice
and
corn
recommended
if
case
on
american
food
no
try
this
beer
with
mexican
its
flavor
not
go
with
powerful
taste
of
this
food
an
attractive
copperamber
color
with
a
nice
effervescence
makes
this
na
look
appealing
unfortunately
the
head
is
fleeting
at
best
smell
of
cereal
grains
seemed
a
little
more
pronounced
that
some
alcoholic
ab
brews
mouthfeel
is
light
and
empty
but
about
what
is
expected
for
the
style
almost
no
hops
anywhere
in
the
beer
save
for
a
trace
at
the
finish
this
is
a
simple
unoffending
average
na
beer
id
drink
it
over
water
or
soda
but
thats
about
it
blah
no
good
and
a
poor
substitute
for
real
beer
if
you
must
drink
a
na
for
whatever
reason
do
not
make
it
this
one
summary
i
thought
this
would
be
good
at
first
but
after
two
its
not
a
beer
ill
get
again
om
na
is
still
the
winner
for
me
funny
how
this
looks
better
rated
that
some
of
the
other
nas
ive
reviewed
i
rate
em
like
i
drink
em
drinkability
plain
and
simple
its
not
looks
like
a
beer
pours
like
a
beer
um
there
the
similarity
ends
fizzy
head
disappears
faster
than
a
7up
smells
like
a
sweetened
nestea
a
halfway
decent
amber
body
for
the
style
at
least
and
lasted
a
good
little
while
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone

to

but
in
the
world
of
n
a
s
i
got
an
itch
to
try
some
nonalcoholic
beers
and
when
i
saw
this
at
the
market
for
2

i
figured
for
that
low
a
price
how
could
i
lose
after
drinking
this
i
feel
like
i
totally
wasted
2

poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
smell
was
also
virtually
nonexistent
a
hint
of
grains
taste
was
also
weak
to
put
it
mildly
a
bit
metalllic
slight
bitterness
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
maybe
it
is
just
this
style
but
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
i
had
an
initial
pour
of
just
under
a
fingers
worth
of
bubbling
bonewhite
head
that
tried
to
reduce
to
wisps
but
could
not
quite
achieve
it
instead
i
got
a
film
of
head
that
cantinued
to
bubble
and
burble
away
color
was
a
light
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
reminded
me
of
an
adjunct
lager
in
terms
of
its
inherent
honey
and
grainlike
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
much
too
thin
to
be
of
any
merit
way
watery
and
i
cannot
forgive
that
still
it
had
a
light
sweetness
lagerlike
albeit
muted
finish
was
pleasant
slightly
refreshing
worth
drinking
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
n
a
beer
as
my
uncle
was
this
past
saturday
then
this
has
to
rank
up
there
in
my
book
for
the
style
put
this
in
your
cooler

about
the
only
thing
you
can
say
about
na
or
la
beers
is
that
they
moisten
your
throat
on
a
hot
day
pale
straw
colored
pour
followed
with
quickly
dissolving
fizzy
white
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
like
maltflavored
water
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
grainy
but
also
very
much
like
maltflavored
water
thin
mouthfeel
there
is
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
not
as
offensive
as
i
thought
it
would
be
less
of
the
ginger
ale
taste
and
more
of
the
malty
grainy
beer
flavor
i
suppose
you
could
enjoy
this
more
than
a
few
other
na
beers
that
ive
reviewed
drinkability
terrible
some
of
these
na
beers
can
be
quite
ghastly
and
needlessly
so
from
a
12oz
can
pours
a
clear
light
pale
yellow
not
pretty
at
all
smells
exactly
like
an
ashtray
or
cigar
smoke
worst
smelling
beer
ever
below
average
carbonation
first
sip
is
almost
flavorless
with
just
a
tad
of
hops
and
malts
almost
water
like
i
can
not
imagine
consuming
this
product
genesee
na
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
from
a
twelve
ounce
can
doesnt
smell
very
good
a
bit
sulfury
well
i
really
want
to
say
it
hardly
tastes
like
anything
maybe
a
slight
sour
flavor
and
some
leftover
chemical
flavor
not
recommended
pouered
a
pale
yellow
with
large
white
puffy
head
that
quickly
faded
smell
is
so
minmal
as
to
almost
nonexistent
with
maybe
a
slight
sweetness
present
taste
is
also
very
minimal
with
a
starnge
sweetish
texture
finish
is
somewhat
unpleasant
there
are
much
better
nas
avaliable
i
tried
mixing
this
with
a
shot
of
liquor
and
two
sips
later
down
the
sink
it
went
steer
clear
of
this
brew
unless
soda
water
that
tastes
metallic
and
a
little
sour
is
your
thing
go
with
old
milwaukee
na
at
least
that
resembles
beer
people
that
hate
coors
and
coors
varieties
will
also
hate
this
because
it
tastes
smells
feels
looks
and
drinks
exactly
the
same
as
coors
light
but
with
slightly
more
malt
flavor
it
has
that
typical
macro
brew
corn
taste
people
come
to
expect
from
an
american
macro
brew
so
in
a
way
its
refreshing
as
it
doesnt
stray
too
far
from
the
norm
looks
like
a
normal
beer
doesnt
really
smell
like
anything
much
except
a
macro
beer
faintly
tastes
just
like
coors
light
feels
like
water
with
little
carbonation
but
has
standard
head
retention
and
lacing
personally
given
the
fact
it
even
tastes
like
coors
light
is
a
plus
for
me
because
the
other
two
na
beers
ive
tried
tasted
like
they
came
straight
from
a
science
lab
with
a
buddy
who
drinks
na
good
for
him
bad
for
me
overall
order
a
tea
or
a
coke
instead
of
this
loved
it
much
better
than
the
other
nonalcoholic
beers
on
the
market

is

noble
hops

weak

flavor
produces
some
malt
character
and
hop
flavors
dry
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
the
best
in
the
category
overall
the
best
nonalcoholic
brew
ive
tasted
i
would
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
seriously
overall
truly
awful
stuff
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
under
any
circumstances
one
of
the
better
nas
it
actually
smelled
like
a
decent
german
pilsner
but
of
course
the
taste
was
a
huge
disappointment
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
corn
light
powdered
sugar
light
wheat
and
light
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
mineral
water
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
not
much
going
on
here
really
its
a
basic
na
beer
one
that
doesnt
come
across
offensive
in
any
way
overall
i
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
can
which
isnt
really
at
all
as
a
beer
substitute
o
a
little
less
flavorful
than
the
original
but
not
by
much
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
considering
how
close
in
taste
or
lack
thereof
this
beer
is
to
the
original
version
its
not
too
bad
but
overall
its
not
very
good
either
i
would
suggest
trying
this
first
if
you
must
drink
a
lowalcohol
beer
o
i
guess
this
is
unoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
necessarily
understand
why
you
would
waste
the
calories
on
something
that
basically
tastes
like
flavored
water
drinkability
this
beer
wasnt
good
at
all
the
first
low
alcohol
beer
ive
had
and
its
an
experience
i
wont
be
rushing
to
have
again
anytime
soon
upon
being
cracked
open
the
beer
poured
without
incident
creating
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
a
previous
reviewer
mentioned
a
sweet
smell
like
creamed
corn
and
i
will
see
your
creamed
corn
and
raise
you
silage
it
smelled
like
fermented
corn
cobs
stored
in
a
silo
for
later
feed
for
farm
animals
how
in
the
flying
monkey
do
you
create
something
like
this
ooof
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
a
barely
detectable
sweetness
on
the
tongue
it
was
like
drinking
fizzy
sugar
water
the
finish
left
me
with
nothing
i
glanced
at
the
glass
to
ensure
that
i
actually
had
taken
a
drink
this
was
just
a
whole
buncha
nuthin
no
way
is
this
going
into
any
cooler
that
i
own
next
this
is
blasphemy
to
all
things
brewed
i
got
a
few
swigs
in
and
had
to
pour
it
horrible
by
any
standards
d
overall
compared
to
other
low
alcohol
beers
i
would
put
this
one
near
the
bottom
wouldnt
recommend
it
again
the
only
reason
i
drink
this
is
because
there
is
no
real
beer
allowed
on
deployment
to
iraq
while
i
rate
this
beer
higher
than
becks
na
i
still
would
drink
the
becks
over
this
any
day
the
beer
is
lagerish
in
color
malty
aroma
as
well
as
it
posesses
a
maltier
profile
than
other
na
beers
no
real
hop
flavor
or
aroma
to
speak
of
gagging
sweeness
of
unfermented
wort
this
makes
a
horrible
soda
but
i
suppose
if
one
wanted
the
illusion
of
drinking
without
the
intended
benefits
ie
intoxication
this
beer
would
do
the
job
plain
looking
yellow
lager
small
white
head
doughy
slight
aromas
kinda
neutral
really
taste
is
also
sort
of
neutral
some
doughiness
slight
hint
of
what
could
be
a
hop
highly
carbonated
dry
finish
on
the
palate
overall
not
great
even
or
a
nonalcoholic
brew
odouls
is
much
better
if
you
put
this
beer
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
someone
were
pick
it
out
from
other
american
beers
it
has
a
nice
head
when
poured
out
of
the
12
ounce
bottle
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
taste
just
like
a
normal
beer
i
recommend
it
if
you
feel
like
drinking
but
dont
want
to
chance
driving
or
getting
a
hangover
this
is
actually
tolerable
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
its
not
the
greatest
but
it
doesnt
have
any
awful
flavors
or
aftertaste
notes
from
121206
d
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
but
probably
couild
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
bad
but
not
close
to
being
a
regular
purchase
honestly
even
the
teens
chose
to
play
with
sour
pickle
juice
instead
of
this
na
beer
hmm
looks
halfway
decent
smells
like
gooey
band
aid
tastes
like
kaliber
the
only
other
na
beer
ive
had
i
guess
you
could
get
used
to
the
flavor
if
you
really
want
to
pretend
to
drink
beer
pretty
unappealing
from
the
standpoint
of
somebody
that
wants
a
normal
tasting
beer
though
overall
this
is
your
average
macro
na
d
if
youre
into
na
beer
for
a
while
its
worth
the
try
given
the
price
and
you
could
probably
drink
all
night
with
this
stuff
although
do
remember
that
it
is
not
alcoholfree
it
still

average
na
beer
no
more
flavor
to
malt
this
beverage
pours
a
deep
golden
color
the
head
is
a
soapbubble
solution
of
thin
consistency
and
zero
life
large
bubbles
of
co2
constantly
float
to
the
top
of
the
beer
almost
no
aroma
at
all
but
quit
smooth
and
sweet
pretty
decent
malt
flavor
overall
i
dont
consider
this
reak
beer
it
might
also
mix
well
with
some
non
alcholohic
cider
i
have
tried
this
with
some
lowno
alcohol
beers
and
it
made
them
more
palatable
darkened
the
color
a
bit
and
kept
the
bubbles
going
a
bit
longer
it
made
the
drink
more
enjoyable
first
things
first
this
is
a
non
alcoholic
beer
all
comments
should
be
interpreted
through
this
lens
becks
na
is
hoppy
and
tasty
though
there
is
not
much
of
a
head
it
had
a
great
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
i
could
down
one
if
these
on
a
hot
day
in
about
3
seconds
i
should
also
note
that
i
prefer
na
beer
when
it
is
ice
cold
the
one
i
am
reviewing
came
from
the
porch
at
32
degrees
yum
cold
smooth
delicious
for
when
you
dont
wanna
even
approach
drunkenness
with
your
beer
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
hard
water
very
light
generic
grains
and
a
twinge
of
the
vaguest
sense
of
flowers
possible
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
hard
water
leading
the
charge
all
the
way
theres
almost
no
flavor
here
much
less
that
of
the
beer
flavor
our
grandparents
always
go
on
about
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thoroughly
watery
feel
overall
this
doesnt
seem
all
that
much
like
nonalcoholic
beer
to
me
as
much
as
it
does
beerflavored
water
if
you
wanted
a
becks
without
the
alcohol
youd
be
sorely
disappointed
here
once
again
those
germans
know
how
to
make
lagers
even
the
kind
without
an
ingredient
that
readily
defines
beer
not
great
but
drinkable
enough
if
you
happen
to
be
in
the
unfortunate
position
to
make
this
sort
of
thing
your
regular
goto
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
green
glass
eurostyle
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
too
chemicalish
for
me
euroskunk
and
a
nice
appearance
and
appropriate
carbonation
about
sums
it
up
not
the
most
refreshing
nalow
alcohol
beer
ive
had
overall
if
you
like
regular
becks
and
need
to
avoid
alcohol
for
some
reason
give
this
a
try
golden
with
a
finger
plus
of
whites
that
only
slowly
falls
to
a
solid
sheet
of
the
same
really
the
best
looking
n
a
beer
ive
seen
smells
like
many
of
the
others
corn
grain
sweet
white
bread
but
this
one
has
an
odd
squash
butternut
or
pumpkin
character
taste
is
corny
with
some
sugar
and
a
slight
grain
cleanliness
medium
on
light
with
moderate
carb
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
not
bad
dont
care
for
the
nose
here
ive
enjoyed
it
with
snack
foods
like
popcorn
beef
jerky
and
kettle
chips
as
well
as
sandwiches
and
pizza
man
i
suppose
this
could
be
skunked
but
can
na
beers
even
skunk
what
wouldve
this
tasted
like
in
2013
honestly
hard
to
keep
down
o
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessionable
considering
the
negligible
amounts
of
alcohol
but
i
do
not
really
see
the
point
not
a
style
that
i
drink
regularly
but
i
think
that
all
of
the
beers
in
this
style
seem
to
be
rated
kind
of
low
o
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
considering
that
it
is
nonalcoholicit
has
some
flavors
of
bready
malts
but
there
seems
to
be
some
leftover
chemicals
from
the
process
used
to
remove
the
alcohol
why
bother
this
is
probably
an
above
average
beer
for
the
style
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
all
that
much
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
but
it
was
better
than
i
expected
give
me
a
ipa
or
a
oktoberfest
stout
or
basically
anything
else
lol
o
easily
more
drinkable
than
many
real
alcoholic
light
lagers
thanks
to
its
surprising
bitterness
there
are
fleeting
moments
that
might
lead
one
to
think
they
were
drinking
something
else
because
of
its
low
carbonation
and
lack
of
outright
offensive
qualities
it
makes
for
a
decent
enough
sports
drink
overall
this
was
a
very
bad
beer
not
one
id
like
to
ever
have
again

i
tried
this
beer
on
april
5
2011
after
purchasing
from
a
local
bakery
yes
a
bakery
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
medium
gold
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
grainy
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
with
almost
no
carbonation
the
flavour
is
weak
malt
and
nothing
else
could
quite
possibly
be
a
heavily
watered
down
becks
dr
you
could
down
it
all
night
but
its
just
be
empty
calories
and
no
drunkenness
decently
priced
to
its
credit
even
by
irish
standards
d
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
non
alcoholic
beer
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
the
difference
imo
perfect
for
those
nights
where
you
want
a
brew
but
just
want
to
give
the
liver
a
rest
from
the
booze
ill
probably
get
this
again
and
dont
have
a
problem
drinking
this
must
be
very
drinkable
at
3
huh
bullshit
no
way
should
this
trangression
ever
be
done
to
beer
but
it
has
been
at
least
i
didnt
buy
it
avoid
or
forever
disgrace
yourself
good
option
for
a
non
alcohol
beer
d
if
you
have
to
stay
away
from
alcohol
but
still
want
the
flavor
of
a
beer
this
one
is
ok
poured
in
a
bayenpilsener
glass
look
goldencrystal
color
very
bright
the
foamy
head
is
fat
but
disappear
in
seconds
smell
grains
and
mineral
water
not
unpleasant
taste
dry
malt
and
some
grass
hops
the
grain
from
the
smell
disappear
mouthfeel
very
dry
tart
high
carbonation
and
very
light
body
almost
nonexistent
drinkability
excellent
beer
without
alcohol
but
not
my
type
of
beer
all
in
all
not
good
at
all
i
can
only
stand
to
drink
maybe
two
in
one
sitting
on
a
good
day
however
becks
is
still
the
best
of
the
na
selection
imho
drinkability
a
horrendous
beer
and
a
poor
product
all
around
really
why
its
bad
enough
to
drive
one
to
drink
by
the
time
i
finished
the
2nd
na
beer
id
ever
had
i
was
fully
convinced
that
if
you
want
to
stay
away
from
alcohol
have
water
coke
soda
na
beer
is
a
wrong
number
this
one
looked
alright
just
like
any
macro
would
the
moment
it
moved
from
sight
to
smell
and
taste
it
was
a
big
let
down
very
metallic
stale
and
lifeless
it
was
syrupy
and
unpalatable
fizz
reminded
me
of
stale
and
bitter
ginger
ale
i
shouldve
stuck
to
a
diet
coke
or
water
still
better
than
corona
hey
for
50
cents
it
was
cheaper
than
a
bottle
of
water
and
sort
of
tasted
like
a
real
beer
d
okay
heres
the
thing
if
you
really
thirsty
and
it
is
hot
this
stuff
kicks
butt
its
low
in
calories
and
you
almost
feel
like
you
are
having
a
beer
it
certainly
wont
win
any
awards
but
if
you
cant
have
the
alcohol
in
your
beer
youre
better
off
to
stick
to
water
bottle
poured
a
light
copper
color
lager
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
light
skunk
with
some
light
medium
sweet
malt
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
light
medium
sweet
notes
with
some
distinctive
adjunct
and
some
light
skunk
notes
damn
green
bottles
i
cant
say
that
this
is
really
a
lot
worse
then
a
regular
becks
but
then
the
regular
beer
is
not
very
flavourful
to
start
with
light
golden
pour
with
a
surprisingly
long
lasting
white
head
smell
is
similar
to
most
other
na
beers
ive
tried
malty
gummy
and
a
little
odd
but
not
the
worst
one
ive
smelled
taste
is
pretty
sweet
and
malty
corn
syrup
like
sweetness
and
just
cloying
this
is
like
beer
flavored
soda
undrinkable
but
not
the
worst
na
beer
poured
a
tall
dense
brightwhite
head
that
left
a
beautiful
coat
of
lace
glowing
pale
golden
beer
holds
a
swarm
of
fast
rising
bubbles
strong
herbal
hop
notes
are
a
bit
pungent
and
ride
above
a
faint
pale
malt
sweetness
that
is
ever
so
slightly
artificial
faint
flavors
of
spring
flowers
and
tea
ride
a
solid
backbone
of
artificial
sweetener
and
an
acidic
twang
light
crisp
mouthfeel
is
dominated
by
the
acidic
taste
this
beer
has
none
of
the
typical
na
offflavors
in
the
nose
and
those
in
the
flavor
are
less
dominant
then
average
i
dont
mind
the
acidic
flavor
but
if
there
is
one
major
flaw
that
is
it
im
on
the
fence
with
this
one
drinkabity
alright
i
wish
i
could
give
a
little
more
detail
but
i
am
really
marginal
on
this
one
this
is
by
no
means
great
but
its
probably
the
best
na
ive
had
yet
id
buy
it
again
if
i
was
the
designated
driver
and
it
was
on
sale
pours
crystal
clear
straw
with
a
soapy
two
finger
head
surprisingly
good
retention
active
streaming
carbonation
and
rings
of
lace
skunk
aroma
with
the
possibility
of
pilsener
malt
sickeningly
sweet
taste
like
splenda
and
skunked
noble
hop
aftertaste
high
carbonation
and
light
body
fight
a
losing
battle
to
slickness
and
the
finish
is
challenging
i
like
to
be
surprised
by
a
good
na
beer
but
this
one
is
dissapointing
i
havent
yet
put
in
the
numbers
but
its
obvious
that
becks
alkoholfreinonalcoholic
is
the
better
of
these
two
products
and
is
therefore
the
winner
of
the
first
na
shootout
with
blanks
it
isnt
the
best
one
of
these
low
alchohol
beers
that
ive
ever
had
but
is
drinkable
in
a
pinch
lets
hope
that
i
never
find
myself
in
that
big
of
a
pinch
overall
a
plesant
surprise
for
the
location
never
really
noticed
the
lack
of
alchol
flavor
made
up
for
it
even
in
a
mass
market
beer
it
tastes
like
nothing
ive
ever
tried
before
almost
impossible
to
stomach
stay
clear
this
is
truly
an
example
of
alcohol
removal
gone
bad
a
normal
beer
becks
is
this
version
is
embarrasing
to
the
brewery
it
pours
quite
a
pale
golden
tone
with
a
scarce
head
the
smell
faint
and
with
no
inviting
elements
has
some
hops
but
almost
no
other
feel
the
taste
i
can
literally
describe
as
biting
into
grass
and
chewing
a
weak
presence
of
malt
and
excess
water
topped
by
an
awful
excess
of
hops
bitterness
unappropriate
for
the
beers
style
oh
this
is
a
beer
gone
bad
d
remove
the
weird
sweetness
and
this
would
pass
nicely
for
a
typical
epl
one
of
the
better
na
beers
ive
had
huh
taste
is
odd
without
any
alcohol
it
is
noticeable
but
this
is
honestly
better
that
bud
light
its
got
a
light
toastiness
and
decent
light
malt
to
it
its
a
bit
hard
to
drink
but
the
carbonation
isnt
too
strong
so
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
ive
had
many
na
beers
over
the
years
and
this
is
in
the
top
two
the
hop
presence
though
scant
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
the
appearance
and
taste
is
good
for
an
na
i
would
buy
this
out
of
desperation
if
i
was
stuck
in
a
dry
county
for
a
year
and
couldnt
buy
beer
i
wouldnt
be
happy
but
id
be
experiencing
a
feeling
of
better
than
nothing
wellbeing
tit
actually
taste
like
a
cider
its
really
not
good
even
just
as
a
drink
take
out
the
fact
that
its
not
really
a
beer
its
crisp
and
bubbly
but
has
a
sour
cider
taste
but
ive
never
really
had
a
na
before
so
im
not
sure
what
theyre
supposed
to
be
like
so
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
solid
attempt
if
anything
dim
damn
impressed
with
this
i
guarantee
you
could
pour
this
into
a
glass
for
your
macro
drinking
buddy
and
tell
him
it
is
becks
light
or
something
and
hed
never
know
the
difference
the
best
na
beer
i
have
ever
had
highly
recommended
for
the
style
scores
reflect
impressions
for
the
style
but
this
actually
tastes
better
than
most
crap
light
beer
out
there
id
be
curious
to
know
the
calories
in
this
as
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
substantial
than
most
in
this
style
even
though
it
is
a
pilsner
like
beer
what
makes
this
even
more
interesting
to
me
is
i
dont
really
care
for
becks
in
general
but
this
is
a
great
na
it
can
be
drink
but
theres
nothing
to
be
impress
about
d
whats
the
point
i
imagine
if
i
poured
this
out
it
would
be
crystal
clear
with
minimal
head
slight
brown
tinge
aroma
is
a
tiny
bit
of
caramel
there
is
a
brief
artificial
bitterness
that
fades
to
adjunct
flavors
rice
and
a
wisp
of
sweet
caramel
reminiscent
of
malta
goya
and
malta
india
that
was
completely
out
of
place
like
adding
a
little
coke
to
your
piss
beer
it
was
nasty
body
is
thin
weak
and
limp
its
been
awhile
since
my
last
na
beer
but
this
one
really
sucked
update
ok
im
back
to
real
beer
by
now
but
there
was
a
bottle
of
this
leftover
in
the
fridge
so
i
had
it
with
lunch
who
am
i
kidding
this
stuff
is
garbage
skunky
dishwater
scores
scaled
down
accordingly
to
provide
a
compromise
between
my
two
distinctly
different
impressions
its
still
becks
finest
though
god
what
a
horrid
brewery
they
are
due
to
an
injury
i
am
off
alcohol
for
a
month
so
i
put
a
six
of
becks
na
in
the
fridge
this
is
very
drinkable
and
almost
like
a
regular
becks
the
grassy
nose
is
there
and
the
midbody
has
real
taste
i
miss
real
beer
but
this
na
brew
at
least
resembles
a
euro
lager
part
3
of
my
most
successful
mixed
sixer
run
to
the
village
bottle
shoppe
in
west
lafayette
in
im
pretty
sure
in
fact
99
sure
that
ive
never
had
a
na
beer
so
im
pretty
excited
to
try
it
after
popping
the
cap
i
get
a
massive
dose
of
heine
like
skunkyness
at
least
there
beer
already
has
more
character
than
bud
light
appearance
is
that
of
a
typical
macro
lager
only
the
head
consists
of
smaller
bubbles
that
dont
resemble
soap
bubbles
aroma
is
like
i
mentioned
skunky
but
there
is
also
a
faint
malt
aroma
taste
is
clean
and
balanced
i
dont
get
any
hint
of
dms
at
all
in
fact
it
tastes
very
similiar
to
warsteiner
not
bad
by
any
means
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
what
else
would
you
expect
this
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
id
take
it
over
bmc
any
day
a
pleasant
surprise
and
when
its
my
turn
to
be
a
dd
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
as
a
designated
driver
i
was
looking
for
something
other
than
sodapop
id
never
heard
of
haakebeck
what
a
terrific
surprise
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
slight
and
simple
bit
of
hops
taste
is
grainy
and
a
bit
grassy
not
a
lot
of
malt
and
nothing
special
but
there
is
a
taste
which
is
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
has
more
heft
than
most
light

a
drinkable
na
beer
hallelujah
haake
beck
na
was
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
rich
creamy
head
wuth
lots
of
soapy
lace
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
a
little
skunky
the
taste
was
grainy
and
a
bit
sweet
the
dry
finish
had
some
sweetness
and
astringency
if
this
beer
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
it
would
be
a
pretty
decent
na
beer
nevertheless
it
isnt
too
bad
on
busy
hot
summer
days
when
you
want
a
beer
any
beer
but
no
alcohol
nice
enough
for
what
it
is
notes
this
is
perhaps
the
best
na
beer
i
have
ever
had
no
horribly
offensive
like
most
other
na
beers

nothing
great
either
reminded
me
of
beer
but
alas
is
not
i
tried
this
on
a
na
kick
i
like
becks
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
it
looks
and
pours
like
normal
taste
is
lightly
malty
very
spritzy
this
is
not
bad
for
the
style
but
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
ill
eat
the
30
or
so
calories
and
get
the
taste
straw
colored
with
a
small
snowwhite
head
and
abundant
carbonation
good
lace
appearance
resembles
that
of
a
pilsener
aroma
of
caramel
cooked
vegetables
hops
and
yes
a
hint
of
skunkiness
taste
begins
with
a
slight
sting
of
carbonation
and
slightly
tart
malt
finishes
with
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
remarkably
good
for
an
na
beer
i
have
remarked
that
germany
is
incapable
of
producing
a
bad
beer
this
seems
to
apply
to
na
beers
as
well
ingredients
malts
hops
water
quite
impressive
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
pours
a
golden
colour
topped
by
an
average
white
head
that
settles
quite
easily
aroma
and
taste
are
malty
this
beer
goes
down
like
water
it
does
not
have
a
watery
taste
though
poor
carbonation
as
someone
would
expect
quality
nonalcoholic
beer
by
becks
sweet
water
aroma
primarily
but
initially
had
some
nice
european
lager
hops
smell
faded
very
quickly
smallish
head
very
fizzy
gold
and
window
clear
seems
a
little
less
water
than
many
others
full
carbonation
to
the
mouth
feel
helps
distract
from
taste
and
it
has
some
smoothness
to
it
there
is
some
maltiness
to
flavor
especially
up
front
but
it
becomes
an
unpleasant
bitter
flavor
at
the
finish
better
than
many
if
i
had
to
i
could
do
1
or
2
of
these
o
blech
not
particularly
nice
looks
alright
however
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
an
unpleasant
blend
of
cooked
grain
and
stewed
leaves
the
hop
bitterness
stands
out
due
to
the
light
malt
character
but
is
rather
astringent
as
a
result
watery
body
decidedly
mediocre
if
you
were
looking
to
avoid
booze
why
would
you
choose
this
not
recommended
give
it
a
miss
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
surprising
hop
quality
this
really
helped
balance
the
drink
which
is
tough
for
a
lot
of
these
nonalcoholic
beers
the
flavoring
also
stayed
true
to
becks
with
their
characteristic
bitterness
and
metallic
yeastiness
this
is
the
best
of
the
style
we
have
had
to
date
when
comparing
strictly
on
flavor
NA
for
the
record
id
like
to
opine
that
this
is
so
obviously
an
na
beer
but
i
just
cant
the
maltiness
is
just
so
superior
to
many
of
the
pale
lagers
out
there
noticeable
enjoyable
and
well
not
boozy
so
why
cant
a
whole
lot
of
the
normals
get
that
part
right
no
offense
to
warsteiner
theyve
no
doubt
got
their
shit
together
like
many
of
their
german
kin
slight
bitter
taste
with
a
strong
after
taste
not
particularly
impressed
with
a
beer
that
considers
itself
as
the
kind
you
want
to
drink
cause
life
is
too
short
i
didnt
find
anything
that
stood
out
on
this
brew
maybe
if
i
had
tried
it
out
of
a
bottle
it
would
have
been
a
different
experience
overall
decent
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
quite
refreshing
and
fresh
without
too
much
sweetness
im
glad
i
got
this
style
out
of
the
way
now
i
can
go
back
to
drinking
great
new
styles
pretty
stinky
stuff
the
skunk
and
musty
hops
makes
one
nausious
when
blended
with
the
sweet
cake
batter
bready
notes
sugary
toasted
bread
with
skunk
sprayed
on
it
clear
with
hint
of
yellow
faint
soapy
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
spotty
lace
skunk
ruins
what
could
be
some
nice
sweet
bready
flavors
drain
pour
overall
im
not
sure
id
go
with
this
one
as
my
lowalcohol
option
but
id
need
to
look
for
others
before
i
could
completely
dismiss
this
one
d
this
is
not
to
shabby
at
all
a
solid
brew
for
me
even
without
the
alcohol
clearly
the
best
of
the
3
nas
i
had
tonight
not
good
drain
pour
im
glad
i
dont
have
any
sort
of
condition
that
forces
me
to
drink
na
beers
because
they
continue
to
disappoint
the
bottle
caught
my
attention
this
one
for
me
was
a
drain
pour
it
pours
to
a
greenish
yellow
color
kind
of
like
flat
ginger
ale
head
was
gone
almost
as
soon
as
i
stopped
pouring
my
best
description
for
the
smell
and
sorry
if
it
seems
like
i
am
ripping
on
the
beer
but
it
smelled
like
leaves
that
had
been
in
the
gutter
after
a
couple
of
rains
with
a
touch
of
sugar
added
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
not
very
carbonated
which
isnt
too
bad
taste
was
kind
of
like
it
smelled
to
me
not
a
great
aftertaste
finish
was
smooth
it
was
more
of
getting
by
the
taste
maybe
it
was
just
old
for
an
na
beer
this
one
isnt
bad
at
all
i
poured
it
from
a
50
cl
can
with
the
warsteiner
logo
in
bright
blue
into
a
footed
pilsener
glass
very
yellow
and
pale
completely
clear
with
a
watery
appearance
the
head
though
is
amazing
tall
thick
stable
and
incredible
lace
the
aroma
is
a
little
odd
lots
of
very
pale
malt
aroma
its
like
smelling
a
can
of
pilsener
malt
exract
small
touch
of
sulfur
as
well
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
fairly
malty
and
a
touch
grainy
sweeter
than
most
nas
and
not
quite
crisp
different
than
others
that
ive
had
of
course
the
brew
is
watery
and
a
little
skinny
probably
more
substantial
than
others
of
the
style
really
however
this
one
was
much
better
than
i
had
expected
the
pour
was
decent
light
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
tow
inch
fizzy
white
head
decent
retention
as
well
the
aroma
was
lots
of
grainy
malts
light
bready
character
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
flavor
followed
along
nicely
smooth
crisp
clean
not
much
depth
here
but
the
style
really
does
not
require
it
easily
drinkable
and
really
not
that
bad
at
all
for
my
first
low
abv
beer
i
was
not
totally
turned
off
by
it
it
is
strange
to
finish
a
beer
and
feel
not
the
slightest
effect
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
want
to
drink
more
of
these
even
in
a
driving
situation
i
would
greatly
prefer
an
odouls
amber
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
na
drinkability
is
very
low
i
will
never
drink
this
again
for
sure
and
i
regret
buying
it
that
said
warsteiner
makes
decent
beer
and
since
this
is
na
ill
keep
it
in
mind
that
that
probably
has
alot
to
do
with
it
wont
drink
na
again
a
new
favourite
bottle
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
good
white
head
that
was
gone
in
seconds
good
lacing
mose
of
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
watery
flavor
was
malts
hops
and
it
would
seem
corn
bad
bitter
finish
drinkable
and
not
btoo
ad
for
a
na
beer
drinkability
not
bad
it
goes
down
easy
with
just
a
little
after
taste
bite
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
for
an
na
beer
really
a
rather
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer

eventhough
dr
may
please
the

demographic
but
i
doubt
theyre
on
this
site
not
a
terrible
beer
nor
should
it
be
disparaged
merely
for
having
low

but
certainly
not
a
worthy
beer
as
far
as
nonalcohols
go
baltikas
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
am
initially
made
dubious
by
its
green
glass
container
what
will
it
yield
upon
opening
i
love
the
poptop
caps
they
use
and
it
actually
made
a
nice
pop
sound
followed
by
a
release
of
either
saaz
hops
or
skunk
in
terms
of
smell
once
in
the
glass
i
would
say
that
it
is
heavy
on
saaz
as
the
smell
is
not
outright
skunked
i
got
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
pale
goldenyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
i
could
see
into
the
neighbors
kitchen
along
with
lots
of
co2
bubbles
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
taste
of
malt
and
saaz
hops
like
a
dumbeddown
czech
pils
finish
had
a
slight
cardboard
flavor
but
not
so
overpowering
that
it
rated
complete
dunning
frankly
in
total
it
was
light
airy
slightly
flavorful
but
not
worth
seeking
out
i
still
think
that
busch
na
in
cans
has
been
the
best
of
the
lot
overall
flavor
is
not
half
bad
and
the
aroma
is
decent
but
everything
else
kills
this
beer
not
worth
it
taste
is
like
a
lemonlime
soda
or
perhaps
diet
ginger
ale
with
malt
extract
added
sickly
sweet
unbearably
so
light
graininess
is
really
the
only
thing
here
that
remotely
resembles
a
beer
even
though
at
least
half
this
bottle
was
a
drain
pour
i
am
not
unhappy
i
bought
it
almost
worth
it
just
to
see
what
happens
to
a
beer
without
fermenting
grains
present
for
me
nonalcoholic
beer
is
like
kissing
your
sister
whats
the
point
very
light
colour
with
some
sizzling
head
than
reeks
of
cheesy
hay
no
taste
yes
its
thin
basically
my
main
beef
with
this
beer
is
it
is
undrinkable
similar
to
a
bad
flat
seltzer
best
i
can
say
is
that
the
minimum
alcohol
allows
one
to
have
a
proper
beer
afterward
hey
its
nonalcoholic
what
do
you
expect
there
is
nothing
utterly
objectionable
about
this
brew
its
just
not
good
it
pours
pale
yellow
tempted
to
say
off
clear
with
a
big
head
that
stuck
around
much
longer
than
i
expected
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
the
smell
is
rice
mash
just
like
bud
the
stuff
with
alcohol
taste
is
elusive
but
generally
rice
label
says
there
isnt
any
or
watered
down
malt
there
is
no
discernible
hop
presence
and
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
watery
ive
had
better
nonalcoholics
but
ive
also
had
worse
beers
with
the
good
stuff
left
in
penns
best
is
now
my
favorite
na
beer
and
the
price
is
very
good
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
and
high
carbonation
smell
is
very
mild
some
corn
notes
taste
is
virtually
nonexistent
nothing
offensive
just
very
weak
beer
flavored
water
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
left
me
wanting
a
beer
thanks
woody
i
got
it
poured
into
a
glass
i
left
it
briefly
to
settle
so
that
i
could
pour
the
remainder
out
of
the
can
and
the
head
completely
disappeared
color
was
an
odd
pale
goldenyellow
it
was
not
as
light
as
lemonyellow
nor
was
it
as
deep
as
a
gold
interesting
plus
it
had
nequality
clarity
which
is
expected
nose
was
cereal
sweet
but
i
am
thinking
that
is
more
the
standard
for
the
style
and
almost
to
be
expected
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
light
lagerlike
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
lightly
sweet
and
somewhat
tasty
not
bad
but
not
cooler
worthy
either
penns
best
n

is
a
low
alcohol
beer
brewed
by

co
this
brew
has

of

i
got
may
hands
on
some
of
these
for
free
and
said
why
not
this
brew
pours
out
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
light
with
grains
and
malts
the
taste
is
light
with
a
hit
of
malts
and
grains
the
mouthfeel
are
just
like
beer
with
water
penns
beast
n
a
is
a
clean
and
smooth
brew
i
would
drink
this
brew
if
i
wanted
a
brew
with
out
the
buzz
this
beer
is
just
what
it
is
low
alcohol
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
5
out
of
5
drinkability
so
clean
and
mild
that
its
a
very
empty
experience
if
a
fine
beer
is
a
rich
vibrant
oil
painting
than
an
na
beer
is
a
blank
sheet
of
white
paper
d
the
drinkability
is
obviously
pretty
high
considering
the
low
amount
of
alcohol
it
is
a
decent
no
alcohol
beer
that
is
one
of
the
better
that
i
have
had
within
the
style
appears
a
pale
straw
hue
with
a
large
white
quickly
dwindling
head
aromatics
provide
tart
acidity
and
mild
corn
and
rice
sweetness
im
also
getting
some
apple
juice
like
tones
as
well
kinda
smells
like
a
jolly
pumpkin
brew
minus
the
oak
barrel
effects
yeah
right
flavor
is
no
really
beer
like
again
more
tartness
mild
sweetness
some
apple
juice
like
flavors
arise
in
the
taste
no
real
hop
character
going
on
yep
another
nonalcoholic
brew
not
worth
drinking
i
picked
this
one
up
for
my
pregnant
wife
while
on
vactation
as
a
novelty
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
water
drinkability
overall
is
piss
poor
whats
the
point
at
least
if
it
tasted
good
we
need
some
non
alcoholic
imperial
ipas
on
the
market
for
the
price
you
know
this
really
is
a
pretty
decent
na
so
it
gets
a
higher
score
for
pricedrinkability
its
another
na
id
pick
up
if
omna
is
not
available
ready
for
the
price
89
cents
for
a
can
at
total
wine
in
midlothian
picked
up
a
sixpack
to
use
as
spacers
for
a
sunday
afternoon
picnic
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
white
puffy
head
smells
a
little
sweet
with
some
malt
noted
taste
is
extremely
light
but
at
least
not
offensvive
finishes
very
refreshing
for
an
na
beer
this
one
is
pretty
good
my
wife
picked
this
up
from
the
supermarket
the
other
day
granted
i
didnt
expect
much
but
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
na
beer
its
light
yellow
with
excessive
carbonation
thin
head
that
quickly
falls
to
nothingness
its
got
the
expected
wateriness
and
the
look
and
feel
of
an
adjunct
lager
aroma
and
finish
have
a
nice
hoppiness
and
theres
a
grainy
feel
to
the
beer
as
well
im
not
asking
her
to
buy
any
more
still
not
sure
what
she
was
thinking
but
it
wasnt
undrinkable
this
tastes
like
carbonated
water
to
me
not
good
but
hardly
offputting
its
a
bit
like
a
maltier
version
of
canadian
without
the
drying
booziness
wow
whod
a
thunk
drinkable
if
you
just
really
miss
macro
lagers
and
are
in
a
dry
countycountry
or
pregnant
or
the
like
o
the
appearance
on
this
beer
is
better
then
any
normal
macro
beer
out
there
but
thats
where
it
stops
this
style
of
beer
just
doesnt
interest
me
and
i
dont
see
myself
ever
drinking
it
again
i
can
see
where
if
you
have
drinking
problems
you
could
turn
to
this
but
for
me
ill
still
with
beer
with
alcohol
sampled
a
while
ago
not
even
sure
why
i
had
it
to
begin
with
perhaps
bored
had
to
struggle
to
just
get
through
one
aroma
is
weak
pond
water
color
is
standard
swill
gold
and
the
flavor
is
weak
watery
with
some
wheaty
grain
flavor
but
what
is
there
isnt
very
good
at
all
this
was
a
notch
below
pabst
na
but
tasted
most
like
it
it
was
golden
fizzy
but
the
smell
that
empty
husky
beer
scent
that
most
na
beers
have
detracted
lots
mouth
was
average
and
so
was
appearence
washed
and
drank
like
a
soda
beer
beverage
taste
turned
south
though
this
was
sour
tasted
of
cooked
corn
and
was
very
acidic
with
nothing
to
back
it
up
when
the
bar
ran
out
of
kalibur
from
guiness
i
switched
to
this
and
bleah
its
the
same
taste
category
as
pabst
na
but
did
not
appeal
to
me
at
all
im
assuming
this
is
priced
higher
for
a
6
like
odouls
so
for
the
tasteprice
ratio
doesnt
cut
it
goodbye
exel
i
shall
never
have
you
again
this
is
too
sweet
for
me
really
this
is
the
only
na
that
ive
ever
had
and
while
its
not
exactly
bad
its
not
exactly
good
either
i
suppose
if
you
are
hell
bent
not
to
drink
water
to
rehydrate
while
holding
a
drinking
session
then
you
could
go
with
this
i
would
still
prefer
to
go
with
water
some
skunk
in
the
nose
shouldering
out
the
sweet
corn
the
front
is
mostly
corn
but
also
some
dust
the
middle
is
thin
and
a
little
sour
some
metal
shows
up
in
the
finish
but
its
mostly
more
corn
and
a
little
soap
overall
not
bad
nothing
really
detracts
from
this
na
but
nothing
stands
out
either
probably
one
of
the
lighter
nas
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
halfinch
head
that
retains
very
well
carbonation
is
moderate
lace
is
quite
good
aroma
consists
of
unfermented
wort
and
a
caramel
cornlike
sweetness
as
typical
for
these
na
beers
although
not
quite
as
sweet
as
some
some
hops
are
present
in
the
aroma
although
not
enough
the
label
states
fully
brewed
i
wonder
why
na
beer
cant
have
more
flavor
and
mouth
feel
cant
you
boil
up
an
ipa
and
just
bottle
it
sterile
i
tried
this
as
ive
been
drinking
regular
old
milwaukee
lately
as
think
its
fine
and
i
wanted
something
for
my
weekly
alcoholfree
day
this
nearbeer
is
very
poor
in
comparison
very
watery
and
a
bit
nasty
with
acres
of
foam
throwing
out
the
rest
of
the
case
o
this
beer
seemed
a
little
more
drinkable
compared
to
some
of
the
other
nonalcoholic
beers
that
ive
tried
because
it
didnt
have
any
astringent
chemicallike
aromas
or
flavors
oit
has
been
years
since
i
drank
a
lot
of
na
beers
and
my
recollection
was
that
the
german
beers
were
far
superior
to
the
domestic
offerings
still
i
recall
odouls
being
undrinkable
and
this
is
a
bit
superior
i
still
have
half
the
12pack
left
which
will
be
reserved
for
snakebites
and
mixing
with
the
on
tap
additives
to
see
if
i
can
find
a
better
flavor
i
wont
buy
this
one
again

grainy
and
biscuit
malts
in
the
taste
but
no
lingering
anything
it
is
only
58
calories
so
that
is
a
good
thing
funny
something
tells
me
the
whole
spelunky
drinking
challenge
isnt
gonna
work
all
that
well
with
a
nonalcoholic
offering
oh
well
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
malted
barley
fresh
from
the
sack
baby
and
lightlyfunky
water
the
taste
mostly
resembles
water
though
a
twinge
of
funky
stale
beer
tossed
in
for
appearances
sake
honestly
i
have
no
other
way
to
describe
this
stuff
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
watery
feel
overall
i
find
it
difficult
to
refer
to
this
as
beer
even
a
nonalcoholic
one
it
seems
more
like
beerflavored
water
than
anything
i
cant
imagine
why
anyone
would
ever
drink
this
stuff
purposely
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
very
highly
carbonated
smell
is
mild
some
corn
and
grains
taste
is
very
mild
some
light
hints
of
corn
a
touch
of
grain
lacking
in
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
left
me
wanting
a
beer
it
is
what
it
is
spotted
at
a
local
dive
bar
i
was
inclined
to
try
something
shitty
i
thought
it
was
the
red
label
but
it
was
the
na
here
it
goes
pours
a
pale
fizzy
yellow
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
head
quickly
dwindling
away
aroma
has
a
pale
malt
sweetness
with
no
real
hop
or
spice
to
it
just
simply
cooked
vegetables
at
the
basic
meaning
flavor
is
horrid
cooked
corn
basically
the
worst
tasting
anyting
creamed
corn
related
in
liquid
form
i
will
never
go
na
when
it
comes
to
beer
i
would
rather
cut
out
alcohol
than
go
na
this
is
horrible
tasting
liquid
horrible
rancid
finish
high
uncomfortable
carbonation
light
bodied
fizzy
beer
sorry
i
usually
try
to
enjoy
these
types
of
reviews
this
one
just
isnt
enjoyable
in
any
sense
it
pours
a
clear
palest
shade
of
yellow
with
overly
foamy
detergentlike
head
head
lasts
a
surprisingly
long
time
it
also
laces
the
glass
beautifuly
the
scent
at
first
was
wet
hay
or
grass
then
rice
the
problem
here
is
its
nearly
tasteless
that
is
it
doesnt
offend
its
crisp
but
not
beery
no
hops
no
barley
malt
perhaps
just
fermented
rice
krispies
no
lingering
aftertaste
best
point
you
can
drink
all
you
can
stand
to
drink
my
pour
produced
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
pale
strawyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
foul
rankness
like
rotting
vegetable
matter
no
kidding
it
would
have
gagged
a
maggot
ooof
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
kind
of
watery
and
the
taste
remninded
me
of
wheaties
albeit
fermented
not
a
pleasant
taste
the
underside
of
the
can
read
sep
27
2010
so
freshness
was
not
a
factor
in
this
gagathon
finish
left
me
with
buyersdrinkers
remorse
and
not
much
beyond
that
i
believe
that
this
was
my
seventh
or
eighth
n
a
beer
on
the
canquest
tm
and
it
was
handsdown
the
worst
drinkability
you
have
to
be
kidding
me
why
would
anyone
even
finish
this
one
d
very
good
only
if
you
have
to
drive
cars
aside
from
the
smell
this
brew
drinks
ok
just
leave
it
in
the
can
drinkability
hard
to
adequately
critique
as
there
was
hardly
anything
there
sure
theres
almost
no
alcohol
but
theres
almost
no
resemblance
to
actual
beer
so
i
dont
really
understand
the
appeal
not
bad
actually
drinkable
inoffensive
kind
of
like
old
milwaukee
but
with
less
alcohol
this
is
the
only
na
ive
ever
had
its
not
bad
but
ill
stick
to
regular
beer
not
a
bad
beer
for
when
you
want
a
beer
but
dont
want
the
alcohol
a
really
easy
drinker
i
look
forward
to
my
other
5
cans
drinkability
alright
when
you
are
craving
a
beer
but
arent
aloud
to
have
alcohol
to
me
it
really
seemed
like
something
was
missing
obviously
that
would
be
alcohol
and
anything
that
happens
in
the
fermentation
process
it
tasted
grassy
plantlike
and
green
it
didnt
seem
to
taste
like
hops
but
maybe
that
was
the
flavor
and
im
just
not
used
to
tasting
hops
before
theyve
been
turned
into
real
beer
but
anyways
it
actually
wasnt
an
awful
of
an
experience
as
i
thought
it
would
be
its
not
a
good
flavorful
drink
but
its
not
terrible
either
grassy
notquitedone
watery
that
pretty
much
rounds
things
up
old
milwaukee
na
pours
a
crystalclear
and
very
light
strawgold
body
beneath
a
fingerthick
head
of
frothy
brightwhite
foam
the
head
retention
is
fair
and
it
even
leaves
some
partial
walls
of
tiny
sticky
spots
at
the
beginning
of
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
a
bit
of
harshness
which
is
odd
for
a
light
beer
or
nonalcoholic
and
it
seems
almost
like
a
note
of
acetone
perhaps
its
from
high
fermentation
temperatures
its
light
bodied
and
gently
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
displays
a
nice
malt
base
but
again
has
some
odd
character
beneath
it
the
only
hops
present
are
way
in
the
background
and
its
not
particularly
bitter
either
but
still
balanced
it
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
borderline
astringent
with
a
dull
residual
note
of
cereal
drinkable
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
old
milwaukee
na
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
smells
like
vegetables
and
maybe
rice
its
kind
of
musty
smelling
very
light
flavor
sparkling
carbonation
a
little
sweet
a
very
watered
down
beer
flavor
some
metallic
flavors
doesnt
taste
as
heinous
as
i
had
imagined
if
you
cant
drink
beer
i
guess
this
is
a
reasonable
alternative
m
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
water
one
of
the
better
more
drinkable
na
beers
this
is
the
one
i
buy
when
i
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
them
over
a
long
period
of
time
as
a
bonus
its
pretty
cheap
beer
for
a
select
consumers
very
very
low
in
alcohol
well
that
say
the
brewer
is
down
in
the
light
beer
segment
a
beer
for
womens
too
good
for
mexican
and
american
food
smell
like
a
cheaper
beer
smell
too
mouthfeel
a
little
of
hops
and
malt
drinkability
not
recommendable
i
havent
had
a
whole
lot
of
nas
so
i
tried
to
keep
the
style
and
characteristics
in
mind
when
reviewing
this
beer
it
pours
a
very
light
caramel
color
and
has
a
surprising
nice
head
that
doenst
recede
much
at
all
and
has
moderate
carbonation
you
wouldnt
know
its
a
na
based
on
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
is
a
little
sweet
taste
is
only
average
and
again
i
tried
to
keep
the
style
in
mind
low
alcohol
is
gonna
have
less
taste
clausthaler
and
kaliber
are
exceptions
overall
i
think
i
this
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
na
you
wont
ever
get
a
buzz
from
this
stuff
but
its
nice
to
have
once
in
a
great
while
pale
yellow
completely
clear
with
an
unstable
white
head
this
brew
is
highly
carbonated
and
lowly
flavored
its
watery
thin
and
tasteless
there
may
be
a
hint
of
grain
but
no
notable
presence
of
hops
or
malt
tinny
almost
metallic
offtaste
since
my
wife
started
buying
na
beer
from
time
to
time
my
tolerance
for
them
has
increased
this
one
however
has
got
to
be
the
worst
example
of
the
style
there
is
no
joy
in
drinking
this
brew
this
beer
had
a
far
larger
head
than
i
was
expecting
and
it
was
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
it
didnt
have
an
especially
strong
aroma
but
smelled
a
little
sweet
not
very
hoppy
i
really
didnt
think
it
had
much
of
a
taste
just
a
small
hint
of
malt
otherwise
it
was
like
yellow
carbonated
water
for
the
most
part
as
for
mouthfeel
it
was
alright
slightly
carbonated
really
felt
fairly
similar
to
water
in
my
opinion
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
certainly
goes
down
smoothly
but
there
are
definetly
better
nonalcoholic
beers
out
there
if
you
wanted
to
drink
beer
but
had
to
drive
somewhere
this
might
be
a
decent
choice
drinkabilitynotes
not
a
bad
choice
wherever
beer
consumption
is
inappropriate
however
there
are
better
nonalcoholic
beers
to
be
had
might
be
a
good
choice
if
you
want
to
drink
beer
while
working
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
avoid
the
buzz
it
is
certainly
more
refreshing
than
a
soft
drink
taste
sweet
with
plenty
of
grainyadjunct
flavorsand
when
finishing
resembles
a
beverage
that
i
like
to
drink
called
beer
i
remember
sharps
being
sweet
like
om
na
but
the
difference
was
sharps
after
a
few
sips
made
me
want
to
toss
it
out
om
scores
on
the
drinkability
category
because
i
drank
another
and
another
and
when
really
cold
tasted
good
enough
to
fool
me
of
course
you
have
to
like
cheap
beers
like
pbr
and
busch
and
falls
city
to
appreciate
it
because
its
like
a
cheapy
but
when
i
go
to
pitt
late
night
im
going
to
get
it
again
then
on
sat
im
going
to
buy
real
beer
from
a
distributer
this
is
not
a
bad
example
of
non
alcoholic
beer
although
this
brew
is
fairly
typical
of
the
american
pale
lager
style
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
does
not
look
and
taste
any
worse
than
the
average
of
that
style
as
expected
this
has
a
pale
gold
body
with
a
white
head
that
is
minimal
and
quickly
receding
still
the
lace
effect
from
the
residual
is
not
bad
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
with
only
a
small
adjunct
sense
and
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
malt
base
a
bit
thin
and
overly
carbonated
on
feel
limited
drinkability
due
mainly
to
lack
of
any
strong
taste
qualities
this
na
is
a
nice
alternative
to
gingerale
on
a
night
out
with
the
keys
in
your
pocket
looks
and
pours
like
an
regular
american
lager
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
malty
lots
of
carbonation
im
drinking
this
right
now
and
i
cant
believe
how
good
it
tastes
definately
above
average
for
the
type
the
best
na
i
have
come
across
so
far
had
to
try
this
why
not
the
light
version
is
pretty
aweful
too
has
a
malt
taste
but
does
not
taste
like
beer
it
tastes
like
someone
swirled
bad
koolaid
into
a
pitcher
of
carbonated
water
initially
a
nice
light
malt
aroma
that
eventually
takes
on
the
slightly
metalic
quality
of
most
nas
big
full
head
clear
light
gold
color
of
am
lager
taste
isnt
a
whole
lot
different
than
most
for
style
has
initial
malt
taste
that
quickly
leaves
for
a
waterery
metalic
flavor
with
a
quick
and
rather
sugary
sweet
flavor
then
a
tinny
finish
for
the
whole
mouth
watery
thin
nothing
exceptional
or
particularly
better
than
the
rest
i
tried
ths
beverage
in
the
early
1990s
when
nas
hit
the
mainstream
market
in
earnest
and
was
impressed
with
its
authentic
beer
flavor
it
tasted
the
most
like
alcoholic
beer
among
the
offerings
of
the
time
sharps
odouls
coors
cutter
i
just
found
it
again
in
the
grocery
store
and
thought
id
give
it
a
try
again
it
was
even
better
than
i
remember
it
it
has
less
of
a
mineral
water
mouthfeel
now
it
has
a
slight
hop
nose
and
corn
sweetness
with
hints
of
malt
it
still
has
a
bit
of
that
na
weird
flavor
but
not
as
bad
as
some
bmc
nonalcoholic
brews
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
corn
taste
is
also
mild
again
some
corn
a
touch
of
sweetness
fells
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
after
things
and
i
calmed
down
my
pour
generated
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
held
in
and
even
created
some
lacing
as
it
slowly
fell
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
an
adjunct
lager
sweetness
kind
of
malty
but
with
odd
notes
accompanying
the
basic
smell
no
metallic
odors
however
for
you
can
scoffers
mouthfeel
was
thin
not
watery
but
nowhere
medium
the
taste
was
utterly
innocuous
i
was
reminded
of
the
time
that
i
reviewed
michelob
ultra
it
was
equally
tasteless
the
finish
had
a
mild
sweetness
that
was
reminiscent
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
just
more
watered
down
i
am
not
wasting
cooler
space
on
na
beer
but
this
was
not
bad
just
kind
of
bland
no
way
if
there
were
ever
an
oxymoron
its
gotta
be
pabst
n
a
those
green
cans
stand
so
proud
at
2
99
a
six
i
had
to
do
it
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
with
a
nice
bright
white
head
so
far
just
like
every
other
american
light
lager
out
there
aroma
is
full
of
cooked
veggies
and
a
nice
sweet
cereal
note
even
a
mild
herbal
hop
grassiness
in
the
very
far
background
clean
crisp
malt
and
cooked
veggie
sweetness
going
on
with
a
semi
dry
hop
twang
in
the
finishing
keeping
it
really
balanced
a
bit
watery
but
theres
not
much
alcohol
only
a
12
percent
by
volume
i
will
have
to
get
an
odouls
amber
and
regular
to
compare
because
this
is
the
best
non
alcoholic
brew
i
have
ever
tried
including
the
heineken
and
guinness
versions
drinkability
is
solid
refreshing
and
fulfills
the
beer
cravings
after
exercising
or
mowing
the
grass
not
an
option
i
would
go
for
regularly
but
one
that
i
definitely
enjoy
for
what
it
is
spending
some
time
with
nondrinkers
though
they
do
enjoy
a
nonalcoholic
brew
now
and
then
and
i
thought
i
had
left
the
teatotalling
behind
me
bottom
line
surprisingly
drinkable
nice
head
retention
ok
so
it
lasted
longer
than
i
expected
it
to
anyway
but
i
was
seriously
impressed
with
the
fact
that
it
tasted
like
beer
some
nas
taste
like
corn
water
or
hops
soda
this
was
a
nice
beerflavored
departure
rather
colorless
yellow
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
a
smooth
if
a
bit
watery
flavor
very
faint
hops
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
thats
all
no
metallic
taste
no
weird
veggie
flavors
and
well
i
guess
when
you
start
rating
a
beer
by
what
it
is
not
its
time
to
stop
easily
my
favorite
domestic
e
g
macro
na
a
niceif
underpoweredna
beer
4
49
6pack
drinkability
is
below
average
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
is
a
little
less
tasty
than
om
but
will
do
when
om
is
not
available
just
like
the
busch
na
drinkability
this
is
basically
cornflake
cola
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
then
this
is
for
you
wow
this
is
the
least
flavorful
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
it
blows
my
mind
man
serously
it
is
like
a
mild
tonic
water
the
nose
is
also
not
to
be
found
a
little
clinging
lace
yes
i
am
as
suprised
as
you
it
looks
like
a
beer
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
take
it
i
am
giving
it
1
5s
across
the
board
besides
appearance
only
because
it
is
not
offensive
there
are
no
flavor
crystals
floating
around
in
it
it
is
yellownot
brown
like
sewer
it
is
serously
just
wonder
bread
but
with
just
the
crust
nothing
inside
beware
available
from
the
tub
so
why
not
give
it
a
shot
heres
why
thin
light
watery
body
no
real
head
on
top
of
the
palest
of
yellow
body
no
lacing
the
nose
is
largely
nonexistent
and
gives
off
adjunct
sense
virtually
no
taste
sweetened
corn
water
pours
weak
almost
no
head
taste
is
smooth
yet
very
weak
and
watered
down
finish
is
sweet
and
dry
a
very
flavorless
brew
very
little
hoppiness
or
malt
mostly
it
tastes
like
grass
and
corn
i
didnt
care
for
this
and
dont
recomment
it
i
think
next
time
i
want
a
na
brew
ill
try
odouls
i
really
only
tried
this
because
i
want
to
tried
all
ba
styles
of
beer
and
im
only
a
few
short
at
the
moment
i
was
surprised
that
i
didnt
hate
this
it
is
a
little
bit
too
sweet
but
is
far
superior
to
the
regular
labatt
blue
i
could
actually
drink
this
which
is
not
something
i
can
say
for
the
original
but
maybe
the
original
needs
a
revisit
i
feel
like
im
rating
a
little
high
but
for
the
style
of
beer
na
its
a
fine
product
this
is
my
first
nonalcoholic
beer
so
im
not
really
sure
if
this
is
good
or
bad
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
pours
out
a
yellow
hue
with
a
thin
whitehead
that
has
high
carbonation
minimal
retention
and
no
lacing
this
beer
i
could
hardly
smell
anything
but
based
on
taste
it
is
very
similar
to
a
regular
labatt
blue
with
some
corn
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
it
has
a
nice
smooth
crisp
clean
finish
to
it
and
is
good
as
a
substitute
for
people
that
like
labatt
blue
but
dont
want
the
alcohol
in
their
beer
but
since
i
prefer
some
alcohol
i
probably
will
drink
this
stuff
very
rarely
sucks
super
light
light
beer
i
dont
have
much
expierience
with
the
style
nor
can
i
really
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
drink
this
by
far
the
lightest
most
watery
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
an
average
na
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
and
quickly
checked
ba
which
had
it
at
a
b
so
i
picked
it
over
two
other
nas
that
i
prefer
clausthaler
and
odouls
amber
its
a
very
drinkable
na
but
unlike
other
better
nas
you
can
definitely
tell
something
is
lacking
this
brew
may
not
be
for
the
traditional
beer
drinker
but
for
those
of
us
who
cant
have
the
alcohol
this
hits
the
spot
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
one
finger
of
white
head
it
is
yellow
in
color
it
looks
just
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
but
not
grainy
like
adjuncts
the
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
it
reminds
me
of
a
light
beer
the
finish
is
clean
with
no
lingering
flavors
it
is
pretty
watered
down
this
is
probably
the
last
nonalcoholic
beer
that
i
will
consume
i
just
cant
see
paying
anything
for
a
beer
that
will
not
self
medicate
me
you
gotta
look
at
this
beer
for
what
it
is
and
not
compare
it
to
your
favorite
full
strength
beer
coopers
could
do
a
lil
better
but
great
for
what
it
is
overall
a
3
5
because
its
a
decent
shot
at
a
na
beer
i
think
coopers
could
do
better
though
pregnant
women
and
recovering
alcoholics
watch
out
id
drink
these
on
a
hot
day
if
i
had
to
a
decent
attempt
at
making
an
alcohol
free
beer
taste
ok
but
only
just
ok
however
for
a
soft
drink
with
a
little
bit
of
punch
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
i
wil
go
most
beers
in
the
world
before
this
one
with
that
being
said
considering
the
market
the
company
is
trying
to
hit
i
think
its
a
great
idea
for
those
who
dont
or
cant
drink
alcohol
much
and
they
have
pulled
it
off
pretty
well
its
a
brewed
soft
drink
this
is
until
now
the
best
alcohol
free
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
instead
of
a
regular
witbier
as
this
is
in
fact
better
than
some
of
its
alcoholic
witbier
cousins
coriander
curacao
and
yeast
all
typical
ingredients
of
a
witbier
are
not
mentioned
on
the
label
and
maybe
not
present
this
is
a
bit
suspicious
but
i
do
not
care
as
this
is
an
almost
perfect
alcohol
free
emulation
of
a
witbier
hmmm
unusual
it
looks
almost
like
the
real
deal
and
the
aroma
is
a
decent
mimic
as
well
however
the
flavour
leaves
something
to
be
desired
its
too
sweet
and
has
bizarre
artificial
hints
that
spoil
it
the
body
could
also
use
work
wheres
the
carbonation
that
said
i
suppose
this
is
a
fair
stab
at
an
alcoholfree
brew
its
better
than
many
lowalcohol
lagers
and
does
a
reasonable
job
of
imitating
a
wit
im
still
not
sure
id
choose
this
if
the
situation
demanded
it
there
are
other
alcoholfree
drinks
out
there
worth
trying
if
you
need
to
avoid
booze
overall
very
good
for
a
non
alcoholic
white
beer
o
amazing
for
the
style
would
be
really
nice
on
a
hot
day
while
hiking
or
something
where
i
would
want
to
save
alcohol
for
later
o
served
ice
cold
to
scare
most
of
that
dishwater
away
this
is
still
a
pretty
special
summer
drink
and
even
though
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
nonalcoholic
ones
ive
had
o
this
is
probably
the
best
low
alcohol
beer
ive
had
yet
having
said
that
bavaria
0
0
is
perhaps
the
most
heinous
na
beer
ive
encountered
sweet
and
corny
and
metallic
and
sour
and
just
tremendously
unpleasant
in
every
way
i
can
think
of
this
is
better
than
i
thought
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
plan
to
go
back
to
it
however
pilseners
are
not
my
favorite
style
and
i
think
it
is
a
tad
too
sweet
and
i
would
enjoy
a
stronger
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
overall
not
a
good
one
i
drunk
it
in
big
gulps
to
make
the
torture
end
sooner
well
not
really
all
that
offensive
given
the
lack
of
the
one
true
ingredient
that
might
give
one
cause
for
giving
a
shit
about
this
offering
it
guess
the
straightup
graininess
without
the
gagworthy
sweet
booziness
the
usual
bavaria
trademark
shows
how
things
really
could
be
given
a
more
deft
hand
at
the
controls
bavaria
regular
0
0
is
not
the
worst
lowalcohol
beer
out
there
but
neither
is
it
in
the
same
league
as
what
i
consider
good
nearbeers
it
has
an
appetizing
list
of
ingredients
but
turns
out
to
be
unbalanced
and
far
too
sweet
give
it
a
try
but
dont
buy
a
sixpack
blech
not
good
if
i
needed
to
stay
off
the
booze
id
drink
something
else
this
is
horrid
sweet
cooked
grain
and
offnotes
flavour
and
aromawise
it
barely
resembles
beer
the
watery
body
doesnt
add
anything
imagine
a
macro
lager
then
subtract
what
little
substance
remains
voila
you
have
bavaria

it

as

is
no

no

its

makes
it
all
the
more
impressive
especially
in
consideration
of
its
competitors
inadequacies
o
this
is
hands
down
the
best
na
i
recall
ever
having
even
as
it
starts
to
warm
it
tastes
magnificent
nice
hop
taste
without
the
syrupy
sweetness
typical
of
the
style
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
no
small
feat
for
an
na
if
you
can
find
this
give
it
a
shot
with
alcohol
less
than
0
5
this
is
not
bad
with
more
depths
than
typical
na
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
low
alcohol
beer
ive
encountered
it
would
pass
as
a
halfdecent
normal
lager
poured
a
huge
creamy
offwhite
head
leaves
a
nice
looking
coat
of
lace
a
cloud
of
carbonation
erupts
from
the
bottom
of
the
transparent
golden
beer
faint
aroma
of
pilsner
malt
sweetness
and
pungent
herbal
hops
the
malt
sweetness
carries
over
into
the
flavor
and
is
joined
by
some
floral
flavors
from
the
hops
there
is
just
a
hint
of
artificial
sweetness
from
the
malt
but
the
flavor
is
heads
of
above
most
nas
the
bitterness
kicks
up
towards
the
end
and
eclipses
the
other
flavors
in
the
finish
the
body
is
solid
somewhere
between
a
pils
and
a
helles
the
faint
off
flavor
is
barely
noticeable
and
nothing
to
complain
about
if
youre
looking
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
NA
NA
NA
o
this
is
not
too
far
from
the
regular
bitburger
everything
is
poorer
but
the
bitterness
is
not
bad
i
will
not
have
a
second
one
i
do
not
even
know
what
else
to
say
and
can
barely
hide
my
dislike
even
now
thin
and
sickly
in
taste
like
an
adjunct
lager
but
without
the
added
benfit
of
getting
you
pissed
and
making
you
forget
the
taste
the
taste
though
is
very
thin
light
and
dry
its
watery
and
has
almost
no
malt
or
grain
character
its
not
bland
though
because
it
has
a
strong
grassybitter
herb
hp
character
that
completely
dominates
the
beer
in
the
absence
of
malt
or
grain
the
resulting
character
is
bitter
green
grass
i
guess
that
this
is
about
as
good
was
one
can
expect
from
nonalcoholic
beer
but
its
still
pretty
rough
taste
is
overly
carbonated
a
bit
watery
but
definitely
beerish
i
mean
you
could
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
these
without
being
upset
at
the
flavor
but
why
would
you
pilsner
style
alcohol
free
beer
decently
tall
froathy
white
head
fades
briskly
glowing
golden
beer
holds
a
few
dozen
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
solid
herbal
hop
aroma
with
a
light
sweetness
from
the
pale
malts
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
soft
and
the
beer
finishes
clean
there
is
a
faint
sweetness
in
the
flavor
and
an
astringent
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
comes
off
as
slightly
chemical
its
has
the
typical
freaky
hop
flavor
found
in
most
nonalcoholic
pilsners
but
its
not
too
pronounced
its
fine
and
better
then
the
typical
american
macro
na
so
if
you
can
find
this
and
want
to
save
your
kidneys
for
another
day
give
this
one
a
try
higher
than
without
ethanol
in
brazil
but
lower
than
with
pure
alcohol
malt
well
im
wrong
to
compare
with
without
however
for
those
who
do
not
drink
alcohol
or
not
may
be
a
solution
but
the
costbenefit
takes
to
make
pure
water
which
seems
to
have
a
bitter
coot
but
not
unpalatable

o
my

na
its

if
you
need
a

hops
and
carbonation
honestly
though
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
sodas
out
there
to
drink
instead
i
hear
theres
a
hop
soda
these
days
overall
not
as
terrible
as
id
expect
it
was
also
interesting
to
try
an
na
beer
at
least
once
unfortunately
ordering
this
beer
automatically
made
me
the
dd
overall
one
of
the

with

some

smells

some

riceeeness
a
little
bit

thats

bad
beverage
at
all
beer
is
thin
but
not
sweet
like
most
of
them
it
has
a
nice
earthy
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
back
there
is
a
great
pilsen
malt
flavor
the
overall
experience
is
kind
of
like
a
bad
pilsner
boring
pilsner
but
it
is
not
a
horrible
sweet
syrupy
mess
like
most
of
these
beers
are
like
i
said
the
best
ive
had
so
far
overall
there
are
better
alternatives
like
soda
or
water
looked
good
and
smelt
decent
but
everything
else
is
forgettable
d
not
one
of
the
better
german
low
abv
beers
kind
of
a
chore
to
drink
in
the
end
pours
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
adjuncts
with
the
overall
aroma
being
that
of
corn
tortillas
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
light
hops
in
addition
to
the
heavy
corn
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
basically
that
of
a
major
macro
lager
only
with
none
of
the
alcohol
almost
tastes
like
a
beer
grainy
flavor
isnt
as
bad
as
most
nas
ive
tried
comes
close
to
a
bad
pils
flavor
somewhat
watery
and
seems
to
have
some
generic
acidic
balance
rather
than
hop
balance
almost
drinkable
good
na
drinkability
now
this
is
a
good
na
i
would
take
this
over
a
heineken
any
day
i
just
drank
this
beer
with
dinner
tonight
i
was
not
impressed
it
had
little
flavour
but
a
strong
aftertaste
it
does
go
down
alright
but
it
does
not
live
up
to
the
bitburger
name
i
compared
it
to
some
other
near
beers
just
to
make
sure
i
gave
it
a
fare
shake
it
was
not
my
least
favorite
on
but
it
was
a
close
runnerup
bitburger
drive
traded
wins
on
appearance
and
smell
and
managed
to
stay
at
least
even
on
mouthfeel
unfortunately
it
lost
the
allimportant
flavor
comparison
and
is
therefore
the
loser
of
na
shootout
with
blanks
iii
i
could
actually
drink
this
stuff
if
i
had
to
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
at
least
one
of
its
fellow
german
low
alcohol
beers
cough
paulaner
cough
thomasbrau
cough
this
is
the
mirror
image
of
most
na
beers
it
has
too
many
hops
for
the
malt
interesting
and
ive
had
far
worse
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
taste
like
a
beer
which
is
the
objective
of
a
lowalcohol
unfortunately
like
a
macro
lager
still
it
did
the
drink
at
the
end
of
a
warm
long
afternoon
somewhat
sweet
and
aggressive
carbonation
pale
yellow
no
head
grassy
metallic
thin
mouthfeel
compared
to
other
beers
drive
tastes
like
an
average
continental
pils
i
rated
it
based
on
that
compared
to
other
nonalcoholic
beers
though
it
is
absolutely
one
of
the
best
it
feels
like
smells
like
beer
and
tastes
like
beer
if
for
some
reason
i
had
to
stop
drinking
alcohol
this
is
what
i
would
take
as
an
alternative
bitburger
drive
pours
yellow
with
some
big
bubbles
probably
the
fault
of
my
dirty
glassware
theres
a
loose
head
of
foam
that
settles
to
pretty
much
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
grains
and
sort
of
cereallike
and
could
be
covered
up
with
some
hops
the
body
is
a
little
more
full
than
a
real
bitburger
and
the
hops
are
diminished
somewhat
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
id
like
a
little
more
hops
especially
up
front
why
else
would
want
i
want
to
drink
an
n
a
beer
i
want
to
taste
malt
and
hops
but
i
cant
have
all
the
alcohol
not
a
first
choice
but
if
you
have
to
drink
a
near
beer
this
is
much
better
than
the
american
versions
crisp
malt
and
hop
flavor
white
bread
lotsa
lagerfunk
in
the
nose
the
front
is
toast
not
toasted

but
toasted
wonderbread
the
middle
is
strangely
bitter
with
a
metallic
finish
at
higher
temps
some
grains
show
in
the
aftertaste
to
its
credit
this
beer
has
none
of
the
cloying
cornsyrup
of
many
other
nas
but
even
still
its
pretty
awful
there
are
many
better
nas
out
there
crystalclear

with
a
mediumsized
snowwhite
head
well
carbonated
with
good

aroma
consists
mainly
of
sweet
malt
like
unfermented
wort
and
a
decent
hop
presence
taste
begins
with
a
surge
of
carbonation
across
the
tongue
followed
by
slightly
tart
malt
flavors
a
mild
hop
presence
asserts
itself
soon
afterward
which
rises
to
a
slightly
metallic
note
at
the
end
of
the
taste
finish
is
quite
dry
the
mouth
feel
while
nothing
spectacular
is
not
bad
one
of
the
better
nonalcoholic
beers
drive
manages
to
avoid
the
excessive
sweetness
often
noted
in
these
products
i
bought
this
by
mistake
thinking
it
was
the
normal
bitburger
pretty
crappy
very
thin
and
watery
in
fact
i
might
as
well
have
been
drinking
water
at
least
it
prolonged
my
night
a
bit
being
a
nonalcoholoic
beerhehehe
you
have
to
take
this
in
context
of
other
na
beers
and
in
that
context
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
ones
going
authentically
german
with
a
malt
character
similar
to
a
becks
or
something
like
that
and
beautifully
carbonated
and
dry
if
you
told
me
this
was
a
normal
german
lager
i
might
not
know
at
least
after
several
ipas
or
something
where
my
palate
was
a
little
cloudy
its
pretty
close
real
pale
in
color
with
a
decent
head
and
crystal
clear
its
got
hop
character
in
the
finish
quite
german
as
well
and
the
whole
thing
is
real
refreshing
my
only
critique
of
it
is
that
it
has
in
both
nose
and
taste
that
classic
import
green
bottle
skunky
thing
going
on
not
a
staleness
but
a
light
or
oxidation
issue
that
distracts
its
not
subtle
so
it
gets
in
the
way
of
me
appreciating
this
all
the
way
but
even
with
it
its
one
of
the
better
na
beers
going
right
now
give
this
to
the
na
drinker
that
typically
drinks
heineken
i
have
taken
to
chugging
one
after
a
bike
ride
to
rid
myself
of
the
sixer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
has
the
unmistakable
flavor
of
a
nonalcoholic
beer
that
isnt
very
appetizing
its
best
quality
is
its
fuller
mouthfeel
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
im
not
that
impressed
still
it
is
not
as
horrible
as
many
other
low
alcohol
brews
pretty
bad
so
far
its
0
for
2
on
the
na
beers
having
gone
into
trying
these
with
no
preconceptions
the
one
word
that
comes
to
mind
so
far
is
awful
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
spicy
noble
hops
grass
and
minerals
are
all
present
the
isnt
as
bold
as
the
aroma
but
hops
still
drive
the
flavor
there
more
minerals
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
aroma
and
a
bit
less
of
the
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
carbonation
is
a
little
too
high
overall
this
is
the
best
nonalcoholic
beer
i
have
had
however
if
for
some
reason
i
couldnt
drink
alcohol
i
think
i
would
simply
forget
about
beer
altogether
rather
than
drink
and
na
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
have
tried
this
if
a
distributor
hadnt
given
it
to
me
good
taste
not
to
bad

be

suppose

this

it

use
some

out

admire
the
principle
of

but
in
this

the
natural
weissbier

has
suffered
greatly
the

is

and
onedimensional
where
have
those

gone
unless
you
need
to
avoid

i
would
recommend
that
you
avoid
this

mouthfeel
is
a

light

still
fairly

for

it

at

it
is

experience
im

there
are

might
have
another
one
of
these
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
i
saw
an
article
in
the
paper
awhile
ago
featuring
this
beer
it
stated
that
athletes
in
europe
drink
this
after
sporting
events
like
americans
dring
gatorade
because
its
enriched
with
vitamins
and
minerals
i
figured
what
the
hell
ill
try
it
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
billowy
off
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
that
i
wasnt
expecting
not
much
for
the
nose
and
tastebuds
just
a
slight
grainess
has
a
medium
body
mouthfeel
to
it
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
it
drinks
like
everyother
beer
nice
and
smooth
good
clean
finish
actually
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
real
beer
not
a
near
beer
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
gets
such
low
grades
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
na
beers
out
there
a
little
high
in
the
effervescence
a
delicious
fauxhefeweizen
o
not
bad
for
0
alcohol
my
hopes
that
this
would
taste
good
have
all
evaporated
now
it
is
medium
in
body
and
really
malty
it
tastes
like
a
shitty
low
alcohol
beer
and
does
not
in
anyway
resemble
erdinger
oh
well
never
again
light
and
refreshing
wheat
beer
but
rather
lackluster
since
there
is
no
banana
or
clove
note
it
tastes
sweet
and
malty
kind
of
like
a
beer
pop
which
is
probably
the
closest
description
i
can
make
refreshing
but
i
found
myself
returning
to
water
after
this
and
not
coming
back
d
very
easy
and
not
filling
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
with
some
bad
grainlike
qualities
the
flavor
is
corn
and
wheat
very
macro
tasting
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
not
sure
why
this
is
called
a
hefeweizen
since
there
are
no
banana
or
clove
notes
to
it
it
tastes
like
your
average
not
very
good
low
alcohol
beer
another
average
alcoholfree
beer
it
does
have
a
bit
more
flavor
than
others
but
otherwise
avoid
overall
not
much
of
a
hef
but
not
bad
for
a
na
and
fairly
refreshing
in
its
own
right
d
not
a
good
beer
but
its
not
really
beer
so
i
cant
complain
to
aggressively
regardless
will
not
drink
again
hmmm
avoid
better
than
expected
but
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
it
looked
good
in
the
glass
poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
four
finger
white
head
that
held
very
well
with
some
lacing
smells
like
the
beer
went
sour
taste
just
as
bad
i
dont
know
how
they
can
sell
something
that
bad
being
it
must
have
been
fresh
i
was
shocked
that
it
was
so
bad
stick
to
regular
endinger
and
keep
off
the
road
instead
dont
try
to
keep
up
with
the
locals
that
ive
seen
drink
by
thier
cars
before
taking
the
wheel
light
cooked
barley
and
grainy
wheat
balanced
by
light
citrus
acidity
theres
something
else
going
on
too
i
wanna
say
its
like
meringue
or
nutty
but
its
really
more
like
cooked
plastic
despite
the
off
characteristics
this
is
actually
a
drinkable
na
d
not
bad
but
a
bit
too
sweet
if
you
want
light
beer
then
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
options
poured
a
huge
offwhite
head
that
sat
above
a
hazy
golden
beer
freakish
sweet
aroma
is
a
bit
grainy
and
corny
sort
of
like
a
bowl
of
half
eaten
frosted
flakes
that
sat
out
all
day
same
thing
in
the
flavor
but
even
more
potent
it
finishes
rediculously
sweet
and
with
a
slight
bitter
bite
this
tastes
nothing
like
any
wheat
beer
ive
head
no
wheat
just
pure
unfermented
malt
flavor
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
that
i
have
had
na
and
low
alcohol
hefes
that
have
the
right
flavorsaromas
and
dont
have
offflavors
the
sweetness
takes
over
the
mouthfeel
and
ruins
that
too
forget
about
this
one
unless
you
like
malta
and
dont
mind
that
this
is
labeled
a
weissbier
i
drank
half
the
bottle
poured
the
remaining
half
in
my
glass
took
one
sip
and
promptly
poured
the
rest
down
the
drain
along
with
the
money
i
spent
on
this
not
at
all
drinkable
purchased
liquid
solutions
great
taste
smell
feel
and
apperance
3
thumbs
up
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
tall
wellsustaining
white
head
a
sugary
sweet
honey
character
dominates
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
of
this
brew
it
tastes
a
bit
like
a
beer
that
is
well
unfinished
whats
more
i
cant
really
detect
too
much
in
the
way
of
hops
sure
there
is
a
bit
of
that
banana
zest
that
youd
expect
from
a
hefe
but
it
doesnt
do
much
for
this
beers
drinkability
i
cant
say
its
horrible
but
it
doesnt
make
you
want
another
however
there
are
two
bright
points
here
one
brats
simmered
in
this
beer
come
out
especially
flavorful
dont
ask
me
why
and
as
i
slowly
but
surely
finish
off
the
sixpack
this
brew
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
erdinger
weissbier
alkoholfrei
is
not
a

needless
to
say
it
doesnt
even
deserve
to
be

in

breath
with
a
real
hefe
weizen
in

this
would
have
been

low

is
the

for
its

as
my

sometimes
curtails
my

does
satisfy
my
urge
for

the
glass
never
loses
its
thick
layer
of
suds
the
beer
is
golden
and
hazy
but
not
glowing
the
way
some
hefes
can
be
there
is
some
wax
pepper
and
clove
in
the
aroma
the
smell
is
perhaps
the
most
weizenlike
feature
the
taste
is
predominately
sweet
with
some
light
graininess
and
grapefruit
hop
its
oddly
reminiscent
of
an
american
extra
pale
ale
like
full
sail
cookie
dough
lingers
on
the
tongue
winter
spices
are
here
also
weird
but
not
in
a
bad
way
ive
noticed
in
na
beers
a
certain
breadstaleness
which
is
normally
masked
or
preserved
in
regular
beer
by
the
alcohol
here
it
is
not
too
intrusive
its
a
tasty
beer
with
a
full
if
not
sensuous
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
it
is
surprisingly
closer
to
my
dreamedof
na
bitter
than
i
would
have
expected
a
tasty
liquid
for
sure
but
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
beer
it
tastes
like
bread
this
would
go
great
with
brats
and
sauerkraut
taste
is
simple
and
thin
however
reasonably
pleasant
i
know
this
is
an
na
but
if
i
were
given
it
in
a
glass
and
told
to
drink
it
i
wouldve
been
hard
pressed
to
know
its
was
alcohol
free
pours
out
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
generous
fluffy
head
taste
is
that
of
a
standard
weiss
albeit
a
bit
lighter
i
detected
bananas
and
clove
in
the
taste
a
gentlemen
that
frequents
the
local
beer
store
i
go
to
cannot
drink
alcohol
and
told
me
about
this
one
tasty
for
an
na
believe
it
or
not
NA
o
not
the
best
la
beer
around
sweetness
needs
better
management
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
again
but
if
for
some
strange
reason
i
desired
an
alcoholfree
beer
like
i
was
desperate
for
something
resembling
beer
this
might
fit
the
bill
but
then
theres
chinotto
and
sanbitter
or
just
straight
lime
juice
theyre
all
nice
bitter
drinks
that
can
suit
this
purpose
not
a
beer
for
me
very
empty
bland
and
eventually
unpleasant
taste
is
not
too
bad
for
a
nonalcohol
beer
it
is
sweet
but
considering
the
style
this
isnt
syrupy
or
too
fullbodied
the
normal
yeast
character
is
still
intact
with
notes
of
banana
and
clove
i
could
drink
this
more
often
if
beer
with
alcohol
wasnt
nicer
d
the
cooked
vegetable
was
such
a
turnoff
that
i
didnt
finish
the
glass
this
killed
the
drinkability
for
me
o
overall
fairly
sweet
and
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
seems
to
be
about
par
for
the
course
when
rated
based
on
style
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
overall
the
best
low
alcohol
beer
i
have
had
pours
out
to
a
frothy
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
film
golden
clear
color
aroma
is
typical
eurolager
with
just
a
touch
of
that
strange
na
whang
flavor
is
weakened
heineken
with
a
grainy
front
sweet
middle
and
dry
seltzery
finish
overall
a
decent
na
brew
that
is
close
to
the
real
thing
o
one
of
the
better
na
beers
i
have
ever
had
im
surprisingly
impressed
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
just
remember
not
to
discriminate
because
its
an
na
overall
1

stay
away
unless
you
hate
yourself
drink
a
sprite
instead
o
for
the
style
this
is
acceptable
and
a
good
starter
beer
rjt
clear
golden
liquid
with
some
bubbles
little
head
nor

no
aroma
to
be
had
in
the

sweet
euro
pale
malts
and
perhaps
corn
and
other
adjuncts
has
a
light
beery
flavor
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitters
tastes
like
an
under
fermented
euro
pale
lager
which
is
what
this
is
sweet
wort
and
some

light

you

abv
this
is
ok
the
deployment
na
beer
for
the
army
for
years
i
have
had
servings
in
cans
and
bottles
overall
it
is
not
horrible
when
you
are
in
ttotal
country
it
has
good
appearance
of
a
regular
beer
it
pours
golden
with
decent
head
but
not
much
for
lace
it
smells
like
a
pasture
with
tones
of
hay
there
is
sort
of
a
stagnant
bland
flavor
it
has
a
thin
body
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
golden
raisin
with
a
strewn
top
layer
of
central
and
perimeter
whites
smells
like
skunked
hops
some
metal
and
maybe
wheat
chex
backwash
not
impressed
by
the
nose
here
taste
is
grain
corn
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
some
sugar
metal
again
not
very
good
thin
body
with
light
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
overall
average
with
a
slightly
dry
bitter
finish
a
little
less
sweet
than
most
overall
this
stuff
is
pretty
decent
its
definitely
easy
to
drink
on
light
bodied
or
more
correctly
thin
and
watery
light
lively
carbonation
i
wont
try
this
again
well
its
tough
to
like
this
one
pretty
poor
all
around
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
compared
to
some
of
the
other
nonalcoholic
beers
out
there
but
seems
like
it
could
use
a
little
more
hops
overall
if
i
did
not
know
this
was
nonalcoholic
i
would
have
thought
it
was
a
coors
light
glad
i
got
to
share
it
with
my
grandma
who
likes
the
taste
of
beer
but
not
the
alcohol
o
shockingly
complex
for
the
style
and
enjoyable
i
think
its
better
than
heineken
the
palate
has
a
blend
of
lemony
and
dusty
saaz
skunk
and
a
touch
of
grain
all
on
an
incredibly
watery
palate
no
real
sweetness
is
present
though
a
touch
of
corn
and
sugar
are
noticeable
drying
on
the
finish
watery
and
with
a
mild
saaz
bite
theres
actually
a
little
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
highly
carbonated
this
is
quenching
and
refreshing
fairly
clean
theres
nothing
discernibly
off
here
this
is
not
bad
at
all
and
i
would
go
as
far
as
recommend
it
its
significantly
better
than
heineken
and
most
macro
lagers
in
terms
of
nonalcoholic
carbonated
beverages
i
would
say
this
is
second
to
maybe
good
tonic
water
as
the
lack
of
sweetness
and
the
added
bitterness
really
do
help
i
actually
drank
the
whole
bottle
skunky
sweet
thin
grainy
aftertaste
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
couple
of
adjunct
lagers
out
there
not
worth
a
second
look
but
it
is
not
as
bad
as
most
out
there
fortunately
my
body
can
currently
tolerate
alcohol
so
im
going
to
go
get
a
beverage
that
has
some
next
o
im
scoring
this
beer
fairly
well
while
pretty
mediocre
as
far
as
beer
goes
i
think
this
beer
is
stellar
when
compared
to
other
nas
on
the
market
this
one
is
about
as
close
as
ive
come
so
ill
meet
in
the
middle
on
scoring
not
great
overall
but
great
for
the
category
o
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
had
na
beer
or
less
than
0
5
beer
as
it
actually
is
if
i
once
was
a
serious
alcoholic
and
could
no
longer
have
real
beer
due
to
health
issues
or
whatever
i
would
gratefully
drink
this
but
i
would
try
the
other
na
beers
out
there
they
might
be
better
either
way
it
is
pretty
cool
they
at
least
make
this
so
someone
can
enjoy
a
beer
if
they
cant
have
alcohol
dr
obviously
its
very
drinkable
as
its
practically
water
but
it
has
no
real
alcohol
content
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
but
perhaps
for
the
nondrinker
it
might
be
more
worthwhile
than
becks
or
odouls
good
god
this
is
foul
pours
pale
straw
white

nose
is
coked

over
fresh
raw

funk
from
fresh

roadkill
amazing
that
they
are
able
to
sell
this
product
would
rather
nose
my
hanes
after
a
long
jog
with
the
socks
too
cereal
grain
sweetness
is
in
there
on
the
palate
sweet
corn
grainy
finish
o
stay
away
from
it
as
much
as
possible
anything
including
water
is
better
than
this
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
quickly
receding
white
head
slight
essence
of
grains
in
the
aroma
and
not
much
else
taste
of
skunk
and
stale
grain
juice
like
water
in
the
mouth
and
not
drinkable
for
any
reason
my
first
non
alcoholic
beer
tasted
more
like
beer
than
i
had
expected
d
this
was
horrendous
i
wish
i
could
give
this
beer
a
zero
on
the
aroma
wow
do
not
buy
this
i
dont
have
much
to
say
skip
it
drink
iced
tea
or
something
else
if
you
really
want
nonalcoholic
beverage
i
just
dont
see
the
point
of
stuff
like
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
clear
watery
yellow
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
smells
like
roadkill
sulfur
metal
minerals
husky
grain
sweet
on
the
palate
extremely
thin
and
somewhat
metallic
signature
heineken
skunk
grainy
watery
finish
with
a
little
astringency
this
is
pretty
much
awful
pours
a
sickly
looking
pale
straw
color
a
little
hazed
with
a
thick
soapy
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
carbonated
water
with
some
grain
and
a
little
corn
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
they
are
usually
thin
for
this
style
drinkability
is
low
because
the
beer
just
isnt
that
good
d
nice
near
beer
no
real
off
flavours
and
it
really
feels
like
youre
drinking
something
all
in
all
on
the
higher
scoring
end
of
the
na
beers
out
there
and
by
far
more
focused
in
flavor
i
cant
think
of
another
brew
that
hides
its
lack
of
alcohol
content
so
well
that
tastes
as
much
like
well
generic
european
pale
lager
beer
i
just
wish
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
so
heinous
give
it
a
try
drinkability
if
i
wanted
a
beer
in
this
style
i
could
have
several
of
these
it
tastes
like
beer
with
a
sweeter
ending
it
tastes
like
an
above
average
lager
good
for
the
style
this
is
obviously
not
my
first
choice
when
i
reach
for
a
beer
but
for
those
times
when
i
cant
have
alcohol
this
is
a
worthy
substitute
best
nonalcoholic
beer
ive
had
taste
like
a
bmc
with
better
hops
slightly
leaves
nothing
to
grasp
onto
you
dont
savor
anything
mouthfeel
wise
you
just
want
to
hurry
up
and
get
over
it
it
would
be
better
to
just
relapse
if
you
were
an
alcoholic
and
drink
a
better
real
beer
than
suffer
through
this
even
worse
its
pricey
d
overall
this
beer
does
the
job
it
is
intending
to
do
a
very
light
bodied
beer
with
very
little
alcohol
worth
a
try
a
very
light
beer
in
more
than
just
taste
it
was
yellow
in
color
and
unnaturally
clear
with
no
head
it
was
litely
carbonated
with
aroma
of
grain
malt
and
hops
as
for
the
taste
there
were
slight
malt
and
hops
present
this
is
a
super
light
na
beer
with
not
much
to
it
not
so
bad
it
has
merits
but
not
many
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
ton
of
rising
carbonation
the
one
finger
head
of
white
foam
retained
pretty
well
like
a
down
comforter
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
beerlike
albeit
macro
beer
slightly
stale
and
skunky
with
generic
grains
and
a
good
malthop
balance
the
flavors
were
clean
and
crisp
though
obviously
stripped
of
the
alcoholic
gumption
one
hopes
from
a
drink
still
for
a
na
beer
it
was
dry
and
smooth
with
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
cereal
grains
the
mouthfeel
was
fair
enough
the
body
lightmedium
and
the
carbonation
good
would
i
order
another
one
not
unless
i
had
to
do
na
but
if
i
did
i
would
for
the
style
bravo
for
an
na
beer
in
that
style
not
bad
it
didnt
have
that
slick
almost
sweet
character
that
most
dealcoholized
beers
have
id
rather
drink
this
than
labatt
na
gennesse
na
coors
na
or
kaliber
if
i
have
to
drink
an
na
beer
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
this
beer
was
largely
grassy
and
earthy
but
manages
to
balance
out
with
some
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
ive
only
tried
a
few
of
these
low
alcohol
brews
but
this
one
seems
to
be
the
best
one
that
ive
had
i
liked
its
low
key
flavors
and
awesome
drinkability
all
in
all
its
decent
and
wont
leave
you
with
a
hangover
you
could
drink
as
many
as
you
want
cheers
drinks
a
lot
like
heineken
light
out
of
a
mini
keg
i
could
see
myself
in
a
crowded
place
dipping
my
arm
in
the
ice
bucket
drinking
a
couple
of
these
before
i
realized
what
it
was
well
it
is
a
nonalcoholic
beer
just
thought
that
id
try
out
this
style
and
so
far
not
impressed
i
cant
believe
i
dirtied
a
glass
for
this
d
if
you
have
to
go
the
na
route
this
is
the
way
to
go
i
dont
really
like
it
all
that
much
but
i
think
some
people
might
and
i
appreciate
its
assertiveness
it
doenst
feel
bad
in
mouth
but
good
neither
i
have
too
i
didnt
want
the
third
not
too
pleasant
for
beer
but
not
terrible
for
the
style
anyway
in
most
cases
i
would
pick
water
over
this
but
if
you
want
something
of
a
beer
flavor
without
the
alcohol
its
not
a
bad
choice
heineken
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
buckler
i
doubt
ill
ever
buy
it
again
but
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
low
alcohol
beers
that
ive
ever
had
its
certainly
in
the
top
three
it
looks
like
n
a
shootout
with
blanks
iv
has
a
clear
winner
designated
drivers
never
had
it
so
good
presentation
packages
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
i
love
this
beer
it
tastes
great
and
mimics
heinekens
regular
brew
wonderfully
most
importantly
introduce
this
beer
to
people
who
only
drink
odoulsim
sure
they
will
be
delighted
to
see
there
are
other
good
tasting
and
smelling
nonalcoholic
beers
about
as
good
an
na
as
ive
had
what
makes
this
one
stand
out
is
the
hop
character
which
id
compare
to
heineken
or
becks
not
bad
at
all
of
course
for
8
a
sixer
it
had
better
be
good
buckler
was
my
consciousfree
answer
its
not
good
but
it
tasted
enough
like
beer
to
be
an
okay
alternative
easy
enough
to
drink
but
no
mouthfeel
at
all
reminded
me
of
a
poor
euro
lager
still
better
than
not
having
anything
at
all
though

recommended
my
wife
will
occationally
buy
an
na
beer
when
shopping
most
are
simply
miserable
this
one
is
actually
drinkable
it
pours
like
an
unappealing
macro
lagerclear
yellow
with
a
fizzy
quickly
falling
head
the
aroma
is
faint
but
fairly
nicegrassy
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
with
hops
and
grain
present
its
thin
watery
and
effervescent
but
its
also
better
than
nearly
all
other
nas
that
ive
had
it
wont
hold
a
candle
to
a
real
beer
but
im
actually
pretty
impressed
wanted
a
nonalcoholic
beer
so
i
could
drive
some
taste
but
funny
aftertaste
decent
looking
head
though
pale
in
the
glass
beer
aroma
masked
by
hint
of
apple
bit
dry
and
low
in
taste
but
passable
in
a
pinch
as
carbonation
gets
you
through
it
beats
a
soft
drink
overall
i
judge
buckler
to
be
a
soso
nonalcoholic
beer
drinkable
but
supremely
boring
yoy
big
schpoonk
on
the
nose
some
underlying
corn
the
front
is
very
light
with
some
graincorn
the
middle
gets
a
little
better
some
malt
pokes
through
the
corn
and
theres
a
little
tanginess
to
it
nice
the
finish
is
sweetish
but
turns
nicely
dry
overall
a
good
na
theres
plenty
of
flavor
and
its
not
too
sweet
or
cloying
its
not
my
favorite
na
but
its
close
it
passes
the
test
for
a
nonalcoholic
beer
an
appearance
right
on
the
average
with
no
present
or
appealing
smell
however
its
not
too
bitter
but
rather
has
a
good
full
malty
taste
that
is
appealing
i
wonder
how
come
heineken
does
not
simply
add
alcohol
to
it
and
label
it
heineken
instead
of
its
current
and
terrible
latter
sampled
a
friends
at
thirsty
dog
about
what
you
would
expect
of
a
na
produced
by
heineken
i
suppose
light
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
little
lacing
aroma
is
faint
hops
with
a
skunky
aspect
as
well
thin
and
watery
and
fizzy
with
very
mild
hops
and
a
somewhat
filmy
finish
id
choose
warsteiners
na
over
this
any
day
drinkability
notes
the
thin
malt
and
processed
hop
flavour
dont
do
much
other
than
leave
things
bland
dont
bother
with
this
one
if
you
are
desperate
for
a
good
tasting
near
beer
it
was
good
to
cook
with
and
that
is
about
it
disclaimer
i
have
not
tried
any
other
nas
so
i
am
simply
comparing
to
light
lagers
such
as
bud
light
buckler
is
brewed
by
heineken
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
buckler
comes
in
a
brown
bottle
too
from
heineken
i
just
dont
get
it
NA
NA
