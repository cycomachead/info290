power
smell

slight

something
dark
and
wellroasted
as
it
warms
taste
is
straight
forward
at
first
nothing
distinguished
no
chocolate
sweetness
or
even
heavy
oats
but
then
gives
way
to
a
rising
bitterness
that
just
lays
there
persisting
on
the
tongue
maybe
the
beer
is
turning
bad
but
it
smells
ok
maybe
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
think
it
is
just
a
burntbitter
slightly
acidic
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
but
finished
thin
on
the
tongue
giving
way
to
that
bitterness
that
lingers
oh
yeah
i
already
covered
that
part
i
could
say
something
predictably
silly
like
its
a
crime
to
recommend
convict
hill
but
that
would
be
pushing
the
rules
and
there
are
many
raters
who
seem
to
like
it
well
enough
it
was
ok
hard
bitter
taste
not
in
a
good
way
overall
a
well
put
together
beer
hts
all
the
right
taste
profile
buttons
but
keeps
everything
drinkable
yet
interesting
recommended
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
little
tan
head
oats
roasted
malt
some
coffee
and
some
cocoa
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
some
roastiness
feel
foamy
tangy
lots
of
chocolate
some
coffee
bitters
bitter
aftertaste
lasted
longer
than
id
like
in
a
stout
o
solid
good
not
great
the
lack
of
sweetness
hurts
it
a
bit
for
me
but
otherwise
its
got
some
good
dark
malt
notes
especially
the
darksemisweet
chocolate
and
coffee
absolutely
no
alcohol
present
in
the
nose
or
taste
which
makes
it
damned
dangerous
because
the
8
abv
as
posted
on
the
brewerys
website
is
not
a
joke
overall
i
like
this
and
will
put
it
on
my
list
to
get
again
if
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
im
looking
forward
to
trying
them
o
the
perfect
breakfast
stout
tons
of
coffee
flavor
followed
by
just
the
right
amount
of
chocolate
o
id
say
this
was
good
but
definitely
not
great
my
biggest
gripe
might
be
the
smokey
burnt
coffee
seemed
to
take
over
the
entire
beer
i
think
coffee
can
be
great
in
stouts
but
this
one
just
went
too
far
with
it
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oat
and
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
char
and
oat
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
cocoa
and
char
combination
going
on
in
the
flavor
while
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
just
seemed
to
miss
a
little
for
me
on
several
levels
a
little
more
texture
and
a
little
richer
and
less
astringent
malt
bill
would
push
this
beer
up
considerably
overall
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
for
such
a
big
beer
it
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
with
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
malts
and
oats
with
a
slight
sweetness
on
the
backend
it
is
a
very
smooth
medium
bodied
stout
that
is
excellently
balanced
it
clocks
in
at
above
9
abv
and
you
can
barely
tell
this
is
a
very
high
quality
local
oatmeal
stout
from
independence
brewing
highish
c
o
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
took
me
by
surprise
robust
oatmeal
flavor
really
balances
out
the
roasted
malt
flavors
while
lending
such
a
creamy
mouthfeel
really
good
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
best
delicious
overall
a
nice
stout
with
no
hint
of
booziness
from
the
abv
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
stout
rjt
i
got
this
one
in
a
trade
with
cyde
12
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
bottled
on
1142012
pours
pitch
black
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
fairly
dense
dark
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
some
nice
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
chocolate
cocoa
oatmeal
caramel
molasses
light
coffee
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
and
roasted
earthiness
very
nice
and
balanced
darkroasted
malt
aromas
with
good
strength
taste
of
big
chocolate
roasted
malt
caramel
molasses
coffee
oatmeal
slight
dark
fruit
and
roasted
earthiness
slight
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
chocolate
cocoa
caramel
coffee
molasses
and
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
damn
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
roasteddark
malt
flavor
with
zero
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
slick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
at
9
2
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
imperial
oatmeal
stout
great
robustness
and
balance
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
gift
from
my
nephew
that
has
been
in
the
cellar
for
about
a
year
oily
black
in
color
but
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
few
carbonation
bubbles
with
almost
no
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
very
subdued
nose
with
some
subtle
roastiness
with
hints
of
oats
and
coffee
for
what
this
lacked
in
appearance
and
smell
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
the
taste
very
rich
and
flavorful
with
great
roasty
notes
lots
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
along
with
hints
of
oatmeal
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
thick
and
extremely
smooth
with
a
nice
subtle
bitter
finish
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
making
this
scary
drinkable
but
its
rich
enough
to
be
a
sipper
overall
an
outstanding
interpretation
of
the
style
o
i
do
recommend
this
little
lady
i
mean
if
you
are
staring
at
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
and
this
obviously
side
with
the
former
but
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
it
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
deserves
recognition
as
such
job
well
doneafter
all
this
i
just
saw
that
it
is
a
9
2
abv
beer
what
this
is
incredibly
well
disguised
thats
going
to
get
a
good
5
added
to
the
flavor
for
sure
nice
job
indeed
o
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
nice
bold
flavors
and
great
when
it
is
cold
outside
perhaps
the
only
negative
was
there
appeared
to
be
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
when
i
got
to
the
end
after
i
drank
the
first
bottle
i
left
a
few
swigs
in
the
2nd
glass
because
i
didnt
want
the
sediment
it
made
the
last
drink
a
bit
strong
and
bitter
o
pretty
average
the
booze
is
maskd
very
well
i
would
have
never
guessedthis
beer
was
9
abv
o
this
was
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
nice
flavor
decent
mouthfeel
a
fairly
nice
aroma
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
however
i
wouldnt
say
its
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
definitely
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
again
sam
thanks
a
lot
for
sending
this
definitely
appreciated
o
solid
oatmeal
stout
cut
down
on
the
carbonation
a
bit
by
swirling
it
for
a
few
seconds
and
you
have
a
winner
overall
this
is
not
the
absolute
greatest
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
still
a
pretty
good
effort
from
independence
brewing
and
one
of
the
better
products
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
o
this
is
9
no
way
delicious
very
well
done
as
hot
as
i
am
i
find
myself
quickly
going
back
for
another
drink
of
this
very
impressed
with
this
oatmeal
stout
o
pretty
easy
going
oatmeal
stout
hides
the
abv
fantastically
well
for
a
beer
this
big
id
pick
some
up
every
now
and
then
if
it
were
a
local
pour
is
viscous
opaque
black
with
tight
dark
tan
head
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
roast
a
touch
chalky
bitter
coffee
and
a
bit
earthy
the
taste
is
big
roasty
earthy
chocolatey
the
finish
is
bitter
coffee
and
lingers
the
body
is
thick
creamy
highly
carbonated
not
bad
a
touch
on
the
roastybitter
side
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
feel
to
it
it
is
moderately
carbonated
and
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
despite
being
aged
for
quite
some
time
i
cant
help
but
compare
this
beer
to
stones
12th
anniversary
bitter
chocolate
stout
there
is
a
lot
of
similarities
here
but
i
think
if
given
the
choice
to
pick
between
the
2
i
would
go
with
this
one
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
it
is
worth
checking
out
overall
a
good
strong
stout
perfect
for
a
slow
sipper
on
a
cool
night
thanks
to
tim
from
houston
for
adding
this
into
the
beer
trade
o
i
just
realized
how
heavy
of
a
stout
this
is
and
am
shocked
at
the
lack
of
alcohol
smell
well
done
a
very
nice
light
tasting
stout
well
balanced
in
every
aspect
o
very
tasty
stout
with
about
everything
youd
like
from
a
beer
of
this
style
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
this
beer
is
definitely
hitting
the
spot
right
now
significantly
roasted
with
lots
of
dark
chocolate
notes
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
balance
as
well
as
a
richness
that
is
just
hitting
the
spot
on
this
cold
december
evening
in
tucson
this
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
with
cocoacolored
foam
resting
atop
it
theres
a
light
roasty
aroma
to
it
which
turns
sharp
and
bold
on
the
palate
dark
chocolate
bitterness
dominates
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
not
bad
but
not
one
id
break
out
of
jail
to
drink
again
either
o
delicious
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
type
thanks
to
texasfan549
the
pour
is
viscous
slight
tan
head
on
top
of
a
oilyblack
liquid
the
aroma
is
burnt
coffee
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
is
full
of
dark
roasted
notes
burnt
coffee
slightly
bitter
finish
the
body
is
full
light
carbonation
no
discernable
booze
solid
stout
a
tad
too
heavy
on
the
roasted
notes
but
very
enjoyable
atmosphere
is
good
dark
intimidating
appearance
but
no
real
head
and
not
much
lacing
nose
is
heavy
and
hearty
combination
of
grains
and
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
all
charred
together
flavor
is
woody
and
malty
with
a
pungent
balance
of
fermented
grains
roasted
malt
and
coffee
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
full
body
beer
silky
and
creamy
as
expected
from
an
oatmeal
stout
very
easy
to
drink
glad
the
brewery
brought
this
out
to
sf
for
the
awards
pretty
solid
although
nothing
extra
special
the
roasted
malts
can
be
overpowering
a
times
although
the
oatmeal
gives
it
a
good
creamy
texture
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
with
high
abv
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
lower
abv
summit
or
higher
abv
southern
tier
oat
id
enjoy
it
in
texas
but
not
sure
if
id
want
to
seek
it
out
again
great
to
try
o
not
too
bad
it
was
fairly
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
night
like
tonight
overall
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
especially
if
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
like
i
am
sad
it
is
not
available
in
my
area
yet
and
will
long
for
more
when
it
is
gone
check
it
out
and
enjoy
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
overall
its
certainly
not
bad
i
am
enjoying
it
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
anything
special
the
same
stout
that
your
local
brewery
is
making
right
now
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
i
have
never
heard
of
it
or
the
brewery
and
am
really
pleased
with
this
extra
its
a
high
quality
highly
drinkable
and
very
well
balancedcrafted
beer
o
perfect
for
a
cold
night
like
tonight
this
beer
is
pretty
unrelenting
in
oatmeal
and
malt
giving
a
dry
but
heavy
stout
given
another
30
degree
night
i
would
have
another
thanks
to
freeverse
for
the
initial
opportunity
and
to
duff247
for
the
opportunity
to
revisit
received
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
a
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
initially
started
pouring
this
down
the
side
to
keep
the
head
in
check
then
poured
straight
down
the
center
for
the
last
3rd
of
the
pour
to
get
the
desired
crown
however
this
beer
generated
but
a
few
columns
of
fizz
otherwise
its
perfectly
opaque
like
just
about
every
other
stout
on
earth
the
smell
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
by
far
chocolate
a
bit
of
tofffee
andor
caramel
and
a
roasted
grainy
scent
that
is
just
terrific
the
taste
isnt
quite
up
to
par
with
the
bouquet
however
its
quite
bitter
with
a
heavy
dose
of
black
coffee
dominating
the
flavor
profile
charred
oak
with
a
bit
smokiness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
the
low
point
its
very
very
thin
and
heavily
carbonated
it
doesnt
have
the
dense
creaminess
i
prefer
in
my
stouts
letting
it
rest
on
your
tongue
is
like
having
an
9volt
battery
in
contact
with
its
tip
not
a
pleasant
feel
at
all
overall
not
a
stout
i
plan
on
revisiting
ill
give
the
remaining
bottles
away
as
extras
so
others
can
tick
this
and
form
their
own
opinions
o
not
bad
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
seems
about
average
from
my
perspective
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
diamond
in
the
rough
that
totally
deserves
more
credit
than
it
gets
awesome
oatmeal
stout
that
comes
in
a
4pk
for
the
same
price
as
a
bomber
of
something
comparable
d
great
to
see
a
high
abv
oatmeal
stout
readily
in
available
in
4packs
thanks
to
brad
for
hookin
up
one
of
my
wants
thisll
be
a
great
wintry
brew
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
independence
brewing
co
im
not
familiar
enough
with
stouts
to
offer
improvements
but
with
the
exception
of
its
superior
drinkability
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
as
exceptional
i
would
still
take
this
over
a
regular
guinness
any
day
cheers
o
this
beer
is
solid
but
uninteresting
o
its
not
that
bad
but
it
lacks
complexity
that
makes
good
beer
what
it
is
toasty
smell
smooth
easy
to
drink
dark
chocolaty
yet
creamy
hint
of
banana
and
orange
peel
best
stout
ive
had
i
will
seek
this
beer
o
a
solid
beer
and
the
perfect
relaxer
for
the
end
of
a
hard
day
beer
really
is
an
amazing
beverage
and
i
feel
this
one
adds
character
to
the
quickly
expanding
selection
o
awesome
oatmeal
stout
though
the
nose
was
a
bit
light
the
beers
taste
was
intense
and
enjoyed
also
this
thing
is
8
5
i
could
drink
these
all
night
having
no
idea
definitely
want
more
from
this
brewery
now
overall
a
pretty
decently
drinkable
little
beer
not
blowing
me
away
but
pleasant
enough
to
drink
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
and
the
price
is
great
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavors
roasted
malt
to
a
chocolate
aftertaste
and
then
the
oatmeal
moves
in
o
probably
my
favorite
locally
made
stout
glad
its
available
year
round
silverxs
bottle
the
beer
almost
jumped
out
of
the
bottle
when
i
opened
it
the
color
is
opaqui
dark
brown
there
was
a
lot
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
and
in
the
glass
the
head
was
huge
light
brown
and
was
huge
it
smells
of
roasted
dry
dark
chocolate
with
a
tmall
amount
of
sourness
the
taste
has
some
dark
fruits
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
a
roasted
bitterness
it
feels
thick
warming
and
slightly
dry
i
cant
help
but
think
that
theres
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
i
need
to
try
it
again
there
were
clumps
of
foamy
sediment
and
the
smell
and
taste
was
a
little
off
pours
a
beautiful
opaque
near
black
no
light
passing
through
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
smell
is
rich
and
almost
briny
n
a
good
way
and
flavor
matches
almost
note
for
note
nicely
carbonated
not
quite
chewy
id
drink
this
again
sticky
sand
colored
foam
on
a
dark
almost
black
beer
the
nose
was
very
chocolately
with
a
fair
bit
of
grain
the
beer
tasted
like
dusty
cocoa
powder
with
a
little
bit
of
licorice
the
beer
was
surprisingly
thin
and
with
a
dry
finish
not
the
best
but
certainly
a
solid
beer
big
thanks
goes
out
to
exiled
for
sending
me
this
one
in
a
past
trade
as
an
extra
served
from
bottle
into
a
spaten
optimator
mug
poured
pitch
black
with
a
two
finger
brown
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
caramel
cream
and
very
subtle
oat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
cream
oatmeal
and
alcohol
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
a
little
much
for
outside
in
our
current
weather
but
still
quite
tasty
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
in
my
opinion
but
that
wouldnt
be
saying
too
much
in
this
case
if
im
honest
worth
trying
for
sure
but
that
is
about
it
ill
take
anotherba
texasclimber
a
simple
stout
that
possibly
caught
me
off
guard
tonight
good
stuff
from
tx
o
something
i
will
go
back
to
in
the
future
very
much
exceeded
what
i
had
expected
from
independence
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
pitch
black
motor
oil
color
but
appears
to
be
pretty
medium
bodied
a
full
offwhitetan
head
fills
the
glass
and
the
recedes
leaving
no
lacing
decent
alcohol
legs
smell
dark
chocolate
molasses
maybe
some
faint
coffee
taste
a
roasty
burnt
bitter
flavor
at
the
back
of
the
throat
rich
carbonation
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
mouthfeel
this
one
is
fresh
has
awesome
thick
and
rich
carbonation
to
it
drinkability
for
8
5
it
is
amazingly
drinkable
with
not
much
detected
alcohol
warmth
this
is
also
6
for
a
4
pack
which
is
an
awesome
price
for
a
beer
this
good
d
a
pretty
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
that
is
heavy
on
bitter
chocolate
in
the
taste
i
enjoyed
the
smell
but
wish
it
had
been
more
carbonated
would
be
willing
to
try
again
overall
decent
didnt
blow
me
out
of
the
water
but
it
was
certainly
solid
big
thanks
to
twiggamortis420
for
knocking
off
this
want
pours
very
dark
brown
but
completely
impenetrable
by
light
with
a
small
khaki
head
that
left
light
wisps
of
lacing
aroma
has
nice
notes
of
roast
and
chocolate
a
bit
of
coffee
and
slight
bitter
aroma
taste
is
right
on
par
with
the
nose
roast
is
in
full
supply
and
pretty
much
dominates
everything
else
although
its
not
astringent
nor
bitter
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
i
would
contribute
it
to
the
hops
rather
than
roasted
barley
chocolate
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
roast
as
its
very
light
and
theres
also
a
touch
of
dark
fruitraisin
peeking
through
but
only
momentarily
nice
full
body
low
carbonation
slick
and
smooth
with
a
bite
of
bitterness
on
the
very
dry
finish
overall
a
really
good
oatmeal
stout
although
maybe
i
wold
like
just
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
strong
roast
good
stuff
thank
again
greg
notes
convict
hill
is
one
bigass
oatmeal
stout
you
dont
drink
this
beer
you
chew
it
full
bodied
with
robust
flavor
and
yet
still
manages
to
hide
the
alcohol
silky
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
finish
balance
it
out
in
perfect
harmony
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
to
date
and
with
i
had
more
a
nice
locally
produced
oatmeal
stout
here
in
austin
good
to
see
pick
this
baby
up
if
you
see
it
o
a
solid
stout
smell
by
far
is
great
in
my
opinion
and
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
an
efes
tulip
quick
beige
head
with
clear
slippery
lacing
aroma
includes
coffee
roasted
malt
and
maybe
a
touch
of
yoohoo
interesting
taste
is
deliciously
smooth
with
no
traces
of
alcohol
some
malt
sweetness
noted
yoohoo
light
flavor
of
coffee
tastes
more
like
a
milk
stout
either
way
amazing
for
the
high
abv
excellent
big
thanks
to
lnashsig
for
sending
this
one
poured
into
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
with
about
12
inch
of
beautiful
brown
head
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
really
great
start
for
this
one
the
flavors
are
great
as
well
although
they
are
not
quite
as
robust
as
they
are
in
the
aroma
the
beer
has
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
very
fine
quality
to
the
carbonation
it
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
am
a
sucker
for
stouts
and
this
one
delivered
for
someone
not
so
big
on
stouts
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
second
stout
that
has
blown
my
mind
in
the
past
year
heck
even
exactly
one
year
after
the
first
the
dfhwws
and
for
my
first
or
among
the
first
texan
beer
i
certainly
will
hunt
this
treat
down
in
the
lone
star
state
or
beyond
its
borders
because
i
tell
ya
its
worthwhile
d
fairly
drinkable
but
the
bitternes
picked
up
a
single
from
whole
foods
its
basically
a
big
roasty
stout
with
a
mild
oatmeal
edge
its
not
overly
thick
and
you
could
easily
mistake
it
for
a
6
beer
theres
a
classic
malty
dark
chocolate
and
java
taste
with
a
little
dark
bread
crust
taste
and
sweetness
not
a
bad
for
a
winter
day
but
also
not
a
standout
stout
d
well
its
ok
but
surprisingly
hot
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
its
a
slightly
different
take
on
an
oatmeal
stout
nothing
too
out
there
but
a
bit
different
nonetheless
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
that
id
like
to
see
again
super
smooth
very
oatmeal
and
coffee
tastes
flavor
really
resides
for
a
long
time
for
an
extra
a
really
good
beer
not
a
whole
lot
of
different
flavors
but
does
what
its
name
says
very
well
overall
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
and
tasty
stout
slightly
filling
but
multiples
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
put
away
this
beer
is
certainly
over
carbonated
and
i
was
worried
it
might
be
infected
but
i
didnt
really
get
an
infection
that
said
the
carbonation
is
distracting
and
takes
away
from
the
beer
a
bit
not
as
much
oatmeal
presence
as
i
would
like
but
still
decent
drink
is
ok
some
warming
booze
the
sticky
finish
and
mouth
coating
makes
it
a
little
tougher
and
just
the
heavy
beer
feel
but
otherwise
not
bad
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
inyourface
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
however
it
lacks
some
of
the
outright
oaty
uniqueness
of
other
oatmeal
stouts
say
samuel
smiths
its
still
a
great
if
big
brew
quite
drinkable
thanks
to
the
balance
of
flavors
best
served
lightly
chilled
this
makes
a
great
breakfast
stout
even
without
the
direct
addition
of
coffee
medium
very
drinkable
and
not
overly
sweet
and
non
noticeable
alcohol
which
amps
up
its
smoothness
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinking
imperial
stout
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
drinkability
great
its
a
very
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
and
definitely
fresh
its
brewed
a
few
minutes
from
here
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
an
ok
stout
but
its
kind
of
messy
and
with
some
obvious
flaws
pours
pitch
black
too
much
head
filled
the
pint
with
less
than
and
inch
of
liquid
smells
like
berries
coffee
cherries
slight
earthy
must
tastes
like
cherries
coffee
dark
breads
and
more
fruit
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
excessive
it
has
been
5
mins
and
the
bubbles
are
still
going
strong
some
cola
and
toffee
flavors
i
also
get
some
bell
pepper
in
the
after
taste
mouthfeel
tries
to
be
smooth
and
creamy
but
this
carbonation
is
waaaay
too
much
for
this
i
dont
want
to
say
infected
but
there
is
something
up
with
this
bottle
still
good
but
not
in
the
capacity
that
it
could
be
8
50
i
was
thinking
more
like
5
especially
after
i
killed
the
bottle
in
about
6
minutes
despite
my
obvious
gluttony
this
texan
oatmeal
stout
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
in
each
sip
i
could
see
it
working
just
as
well
when
gently
quaffed
from
a
snifter
as
it
did
getting
slammed
from
a
nonic
overall
this
was
a
very
pleasing
oatmeal
stout
given
the
chance
id
happily
have
it
again
after
a
second
bottle
was
sent
to
me
from
injured
reserve
that
wasnt
infectedovercarbonated
i
resubmit
my
score
for
the
beer
the
way
it
was
intended
as
overall
i
would
say
a
fairly
solid
oatmeal
stout
drink
ability
was
good
nice
beer
for
a
cold
night
at
9
percent
alcohol
it
goes
down
smoother
than
most
imperial
stouts
just
wish
there
was
more
sweetness
to
the
flavor
and
a
little
less
bitterness
gonna
age
one
for
a
year
and
see
if
that
helps
drinkability
though
not
the
most
attractive
brew
around
its
still
a
soundly
sweet
mighty
tasty
stout
and
a
nice
surprise
as
i
had
yet
to
try
anything
from
independence
brewing
d
good
solid
brew
d
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
to
take
away
from
drinkability
but
it
is
a
bit
strong
for
a
session
beer
overall
a
really
solid
shot
here
from
them
served
as
a
well
placed
night
cap
and
i
really
could
have
easily
had
another
when
i
was
done
good
job
all
around
d
low
the
first
sips
were
great
but
chos
is
too
acrid
for
drinkability
overall
a
bit
above
the
average
oatmeal
stout
it
is
a
bit
too
roasted
for
my
liking
somewhat
drinkable
no
alcohol
showing
in
it
which
surprised
me
for
how
high
the
abv
is
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
slight
tannish
head
with
crimson
highlights
the
head
settles
to
a
nice
color
the
aroma
isnt
really
overly
strong
in
any
way
but
rather
a
subtle
roasted
malt
and
coffee
note
leather
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
are
the
dominate
flavors
in
this
one
i
think
the
oats
in
this
provide
for
a
nice
medium
velvety
mouthfeel
that
is
rather
well
done
even
at
the
abv
the
taste
really
doesnt
have
that
over
alcohol
note
that
some
bigger
beers
can
have
not
overly
roasted
either
because
i
really
dont
get
that
overly
bitter
aftertaste
d
a
pretty
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
that
is
heavy
on
bitter
chocolate
in
the
taste
i
enjoyed
the
smell
but
wish
it
had
been
more
carbonated
would
be
willing
to
try
again
pours
a
very
nice
rich
black
brown
color
with
a
huge
mocha
colored
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
and
has
great
retention
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
some
vanilla
and
tons
of
milk
chocolate
big
roasted
malts
just
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
but
all
milk
chocolate
on
the
palate
big
flavors
of
raisins
and
winter
stone
fruits
masked
by
rich
marshmallow
like
sweetness
that
blends
all
of
the
flavors
together
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
really
couldnt
believe
this
was
8
5
percent
abv
after
its
big
silky
texture
and
no
alcohol
burn
really
a
nice
made
stout
and
perfect
example
of
the
style
12oz
bottle
into
my
westmalle
goblet
awesome
name
and
bottle
looking
cool
dark
brown
pour
with
light
carbonation
disappointing
for
an
oatmeal
love
to
see
this
on
tap
an
alluring
sweet
aroma
surprised
at
the
sweet
chocolate
vanilla
and
oats
coming
through
without
alcohol
on
this
8
5
beer
vanilla
really
shows
more
than
anything
really
nice
the
taste
bores
me
most
of
the
sweetness
is
gone
leaving
a
plain
stout
with
a
little
roastiness
creeping
in
not
bad
just
boring
however
at
the
abv
super
easy
to
drink
d
my
favorite
independence
brew
to
date
but
the
only
other
one
i
remember
was
austin
amber
which
was
overcarbonated
mild
carbonation
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
thanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
trade
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
deep
opaque
motor
oil
black
with
a
thin
quickly
diminishing
tan
head
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
roasted
malts
with
some
bitter
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
smooth
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
blend
of
bitter
cocoa
and
subtle
espresso
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
strong
stout
one
i
would
likely
keep
on
hand
all
winter
if
it
were
available
here
nothing
illustrates
the
oblivion
of
convict
life
quite
like
a
deep
stout
this
one
pours
a
straight
obsidian
topped
by
about
a
halffinger
of
somewhat
resilient
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
coffee
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
burnt
oats
the
taste
is
quite
similar
with
some
blackened
biscuits
charcoal
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
background
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
heftily
smooth
feel
bordering
on
chewiness
overall
a
very
nice
black
stout
another
brew
i
wish
they
carried
around
here
so
i
could
have
it
whenever
the
urge
hits
me
notes
i
would
call
this
more
of
an
export
stout
than
an
imperial
stout
which
is
good
because
we
need
more
of
them
i
have
a
couple
of
issues
an
oatmeal
stout
should
have
a
thicker
mouthfeel
also
im
not
a
fan
of
the
bitter
alcoholsyrup
aftertaste
otherwise
though
its
well
balanced
between
bitter
and
sweet
not
the
best
stout
ever
but
its
a
decent
stab
at
it
to
be
sure
pours
pitch
black
with
a
thin
layer
of
brown
head
pretty
big
aroma
here
oats
black
strap
molasses
and
dark
chocolate
liqueur
the
flavor
has
an
added
note
of
smoke
to
go
along
with
big
fairly
dry
chocolate
flavors
the
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
is
the
overall
highlight
to
compliment
the
flavor
this
is
a
big
ol
oat
stout
thats
worth
trying
at
least
once
d
simple
and
straightforward
a
great
example
of
a
well
balanced
oatmeal
stout
d
i
would
drink
this
frequently
if
it
were
available
to
me
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
id
drink
again
and
for
an
independence
beer
that
says
something
it
is
thin
in
the
mouth
with
very
little
creaminess
but
this
is
a
relatively
easy
drinking
beer
with
little
hint
of
the
abv
i
enjoyed
this
but
wouldnt
go
seeking
it
out
again
dark
dry
and
bitter
this
is
a
stout
to
reckon
with
and
a
joyous
offering
from
independence
its
the
only
beer
listed
on
ba
containing
the
name
convict
d
simple
yet
elegant
yes
overall
interesting
take
on
oatmeal
stout
big
complex
flavors
but
not
as
perfectly
balanced
and
smooth
as
it
could
be
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
will
repurchase
on
tap
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
four
pack
on
ocasion
a
great
brew
with
a
nice
head
that
grows
a
few
seconds
after
the
pour
like
a
good
stout
opaque
in
color
the
nose
lack
a
little
in
definition
its
mild
at
best
of
chocolate
and
maltiness
the
palate
has
a
wonderful
body
with
malt
smokey
bitterness
and
chocolate
the
malt
is
there
the
beer
as
the
mild
sweet
finish
of
a
oatmeal
stout
not
particularly
on
the
ridiculously
sweet
side
so
it
was
balanced
great
texas
brew
for
all
of
its
bold
flavor
very
drinkable
i
finished
mine
quickly
maybe
just
because
it
tasted
so
good
roasty
dark
coffee
notes
blend
with
bakers
chocolate
and
a
grainy
oat
note
mocha
bitterness
lingers
into
the
finish
and
clashes
with
the
hops
nicely
alcohol
is
wellhidden
until
the
very
end
plus
that
familiar
warming
sensation
below
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
at
first
but
the
carbonation
picks
up
midsip
to
add
a
bit
of
kick
to
the
finish
the
mediumthick
body
is
near
perfect
in
consistency
luxurious
on
the
palate
but
never
too
heavy
this
stuff
is
really
goodmaybe
even
better
than
ontap
which
is
a
rarity
independence
had
never
really
impressed
me
until
i
tried
this
beer
almost
a
year
ago
i
just
might
have
to
start
revisiting
some
of
their
other
bottled
selections
because
convict
hill
is
one
excellent
oatmeal
stout
i
was
not
really
impressed
with
this
more
acrid
coffee
that
i
want
for
the
style
and
not
nearly
as
creamy
and
smooth
as
i
was
expecting
oatmeal
stouts
should
be
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
this
is
not
not
bad
but
poorly
made
for
the
style
imo
taste
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
between
roast
and
sweetness
there
are
hints
of
irish
dry
stout
sourness
that
are
not
all
that
uncommon
in
an
oatmeal
stout
i
kinda
like
it
its
a
tad
thin
and
does
not
have
the
viscous
creamy
feeling
many
of
the
best
display
but
this
is
easily
and
hands
down
the
best
beer
from
independence
not
even
close
with
all
the
new
upstarts
in
austin
they
will
need
some
firepower
like
this
to
compete
drinkability
cant
really
go
wrong
at
5
99
a
four
pack
the
alchohol
is
very
well
masked
and
the
beer
is
full
of
flavor
it
just
smells
weird
in
my
opinion
it
is
also
very
fresh
right
now
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
tastes
after
a
few
months
this
and
stash
are
becoming
my
go
to
local
grab
verdict
a
solid
big
american
stout
convict
hill
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
independence
im
looking
forward
to
what
these
guys
brew
up
next
pours
dark
brown
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
with
some
chocolate
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
coffee
cream
and
some
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
and
is
pretty
creamy
low
carbonation
got
this
ontap
at
the
draught
house
pours
with
a
black
color
minimal
head
it
looks
almost
oily
smell
was
very
creamy
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
creamy
as
well
compared
to
other
stouts
this
was
an
easy
drink
even
with
a
higher
abv
the
blend
was
done
well
enough
where
it
was
hardly
noticeable
great
beer
from
start
to
finish
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
stouts
on
tap
at
ginger
man
in
austin
on

but
not
too
heavy
again
nicely
balanced
independence
have
really
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
over
all
i
was
more
than
impressed
if
you
couldnt
tell
i
am
a
huge
lover
of
stouts
and
porters
stones
imperial
russian
and
oatmeal
stouts
in
particular
but
this
impressed
me
hidden
away
in
the
heart
of
texas
capital
a
gem
of
a
brewery
awaits
those
that
are
willing
to
seek
it
out
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
but
seems
around
78
paired
nicely
with
the
chicken
wrap
chips
and
queso
i
had
for
lunch
well
done
i
am
not
able
to
get
past
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
way
over
hopped
for
the
style
as
i
stated
above
i
can
see
there
is
a
a
good
beer
in
here
brewed
with
quality
ingredients
but
the
hops
are
hiding
most
of
what
i
am
looking
for
very
good
stout
nice
tweak
on
the
hop
addition
on
nitrotap
at
prime
16
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
over
an
inch
of
frothy
tan
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
a
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
mix
with
some
smokey
roasted
malts
the
taste
has
more
of
the
sweet
oatmeal
than
in
the
aroma
light
and
sweet
coffee
as
well
as
chocolate
a
bit
of
smoke
towards
the
finish
silky
creamy
mouthfeel
thanks
to
the
nitro
damn
drinkable
this
beer
really
shines
on
the
nitro
tap
overall
worth
seeking
out
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nice
coloring
and
thick
smoke
to
the
malts
negatively
however
the
nose
was
a
little
light
and
the
flavoring
other
than
that
wild
smoke
was
too
we
were
hoping
for
a
better
balance
and
more
solid
flavors
to
mix
with
such
a
strong
component
as
the
smoke
a
delicious
tasting
beer
overall
some
semisweet
chocolate
mixes
with
coffee
and
roasty
malt
good
oatmeal
presence
moderately
sweet
with
the
faintest
kiss
of
hops
mostly
noticed
in
the
somewhat
bitter
finish
very
well
rounded
flavor
and
mouthfeel
which
is
silky
smooth
mediumbodied
and
mediumtolow
on
the
carbonation
side
again
there
is
almost
a
nitro
feel
to
this
beer
even
from
a
regular
tap
one
of
my
favorite
sixpoint
offerings
to
be
sure
very
impressive
o
not
bad
but
another
beer
from
sixpoint
that
i
would
probably
pass
on
the
next
time
around
o
its
sixpoint
so
its
quite
good
but
ill
still
take
diesel
o
good
but
not
great
a
little
too
thin
of
a
stout
for
my
preferences
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
but
needs
a
fuller
body
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
deep
dark
almost
black
hue
with
purple
on
the
edges
capped
by
a
creamy
off
white
head
with
excellent
retention
nose
is
light
with
hint
of
roastiness
taste
is
full
of
roast
malt
light
flower
balances
nicely
mouth
is
light
and
creamy
yeah
o
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
i
know
they
are
supposed
to
be
different
but
i
think
this
is
a
ton
better
than
their
diesel
stout
i
hope
they
can
this
one
as
well
reminds
me
of
a
good
sweet
stout
as
it
has
a
lot
of
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
to
it
would
like
to
have
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
almost
black
it
has
a
nice
finger
of
creamy
tan
head
on
it
the
head
has
good
retention
and
it
leaves
behind
some
scattered
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
toffee
light
hops
and
cream
it
smells
really
nice
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
there
is
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
and
bitterness
there
are
some
flavors
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
toffee
and
mild
hop
flavors
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
roasted
malt
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
that
is
leaning
toward
full
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
smooth
and
it
has
a
really
creamy
feel
to
it
there
is
some
sweetness
and
a
nice
roasted
malt
bitterness
that
balances
it
out
the
roasted
bitterness
lingerings
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
this
has
good
drinkability
it
has
really
nice
flavor
and
great
feel
to
it
it
is
quite
creamy
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
buy
it
again
i
recommend
trying
it
out
if
you
come
across
it
cheers
definitely
a
winner
from
sixpoint
and
is
highly
recommended
i
see
that
its
brewed
in
beautiful
downtown
brooklyn
by
6
points
brewing
co
im
gonna
have
to
take
me
a
trip
over
there
real
soon
o
this
oatmeal
stout
took
nicely
to
the
nitro
all
the
classic
flavors
were
present
and
represented
nicely
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
a
nice
hoppy
stout
the
hops
dominate
over
the
malt
in
this
one
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
flavorful
stout
to
drink
for
a
while
o
nothing
mind
blowing
but
i
got
to
say
despite
its
mellowness
im
actually
really
digging
this
i
hope
maybe
i
can
try
this
one
on
a
regular
co2
pour
one
day
because
that
might
change
my
mind
overall
it
is
interesting
but
needs
more
of
a
malt
backbone
i
think
not
sure
about
how
i
feel
about
the
hop
angle
in
this
i
am
not
sure
i
feel
it
fits
or
melds
well
dont
see
myself
gravitating
towards
it
or
really
desiring
it
taken
from
memory
and
notes
enjoyed
on
8111
o
a
solid
stout
with
a
unique
twist
ill
say
it
again
all
stouts
should
be
served
on
nitro
props
to
spitzers
for
having
3
nitro
taps
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
just
not
so
interesting
d
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
for
the
style
because
it
isnt
very
heavy
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
dry
and
sweet
flavors
lots
of
roasted
malt
up
front
with
hints
of
coffee
bean
chocolate
and
a
prominent
oatmeal
character
theres
a
slight
lactic
cream
presence
midpalate
that
provides
nice
balance
and
there
is
some
more
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
toward
the
dry
roasted
finish
probably
didnt
help
that
rattle
n
hum
had
it
listed
as
a
sweet
stout
it
was
the
polar
opposite
of
anything
sweet
d
i
was
satisfied
with
this
but
it
is
not
my
first
choice
in
oatmeal
stouts
i
found
the
bitterness
to
be
slightly
high
in
hops
and
malt
putting
it
slightly
out
of
balance
the
nitro
treatment
doesnt
help
imo
but
i
would
order
it
again
if
on
c02
to
compare
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
here
this
is
just
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
a
super
silky
feel
that
helped
along
a
good
bit
by
the
nitro
i
could
have
easily
downed
a
couple
of
these
very
sessionable
overall
d
another
solid
dark
offering
from
sixpoint
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
damn
solid
on
cask
at
rattle
n
hum
average
mouthfeel
black
with
some
decent
head
decent
choice
for
cask
balanced
stout
a
bit
on
sweet
side
but
flavourful
malting
makes
it
a
drinkable
stout
nitro
would
make
it
more
creamy
and
maybe
pump
up
the
rating
some
ontap
at
the
spinnerstown
hotel
served
in
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
appeared
pitch
black
with
a
very
short
head
i
really
thought
this
was
a
great
albeit
aggressive
take
on
the
style
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
full
of
big
chocolate
flavors
up
front
with
roasted
barley
around
the
edge
the
malts
are
followed
by
a
powerful
citrus
hops
kick
that
provides
a
great
bitter
contrast
to
the
cocoa
notes
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
ever
had
d
yes
good
lower
alcohol
i
think
very
tasty
d
really
nice
enjoyable
and
solid
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
pretty
good
overall
this
was
a
smooth
oatmeal
stout
however
i
would
have
preferred
to
try
it
on
a
normal
tap
rather
than
the
nitrous
that
being
said
either
way
its
served
its
worth
a
shot

of
roasted

of

a
pretty

and
definitely
very

d
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
id
have
another
if
i
wasnt
meeting
my
boss
later
d
the
flavor
is
good

the

is
great

another
very
enjoyable
offering
from

d
great
flavors
but
smokiness
and
the
slickness
dont
mesh
well
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
on

a
dark
silky
brown
with
a
light
crisp

aroma
is
strong
in
oatmeal
quite
chocolatey
and
with
some
espresso

is
a
strong

presence
with
slightly
bitter

a
good
amount
of

but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
off
or
at

just
not
for
me
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
im
sure
others
would
like
it
deep
dark
brown
thick
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
fair
lacing
found
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
one
to
be
a
little
more
skewed
to
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
than
the
diesel
stout
by
sixpoint
but
still
had
an
overwhelming
amount
of
toastiness
and
dry
grass
finish
the
body
also
was
very
very
thin
for
a
stout
but
a
tiny
bit
thicker
than
the
diesel
d
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
with
quite
a
bit
of
hop
character
especially
for
the
style
d
drinkable
because
it
doesnt
overpower
well
crafted
beer
could
have
been
a
little
more
complex
and
sweeter
da
decent
but
not
great
oatmeal
stout
hv
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
stout
and
a
few
of
these
can
be
had
in
a
single
session
nice
balanced
flavors
makes
this
an
enjoyable
version
it
wasnt
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
but
otis
didnt
really
do
anything
for
me
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
it
was
more
roasted
than
dry
or
have
the
dryness
level
match
up
with
the
roasted
level
i
would
more
than
likely
pass
this
sixpoint
up
if
i
ever
saw
it
again
if
youve
never
had
its
worth

at

once

one
of
my
top
10
stouts
very

recommend

and

mouthfeel
is
medium

gritty

nicely
balanced
between

unexpected
dose
of

a
small
white
creamy
head
that
fades
fast
aroma
was
of
roasted

with
a
chocolate
finish
taste
was
nutty
roasted
coffee
smokey
and
some
malts
mouthfeel
with
creamy
and
smooth
a
very
well
balanced
beer
another
winner
from
sixpoint
i
cant
get
enough
of
their
stuff
this
beer
pours
a
black
opaque
color
with
a
finger
of
thick
offwhite
head
very
good
head
retention
lacing
is
thick
and
sticky
and
present
for
entire
sitting
the
nose
quite
muted
however
there
is
scents
of
fruity
hops
and
caramel
roated
malts
some
slight
undertones
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
made
up
for
the
lack
of
aroma
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
a
nutty
flavor
are
the
most
present
roasted
malts
and
slight
hops
are
also
present
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
but
not
overwhelmingly
filling
very
smooth
going
down
tonight
was
my
first
experience
with
sixpoint
and
both
samples
are
impressive
if
only
sixpoint
would
make
its
outside
of
nyc
then
stout
drinkers
around
the
world
would
have
a
new
session
beer
the
nutty
chocolate
full
roast
flavour
is
dressed
in
a
mouthfeel
as
silky
and
satiny
as
its
complexion
a
word
like
balance
really
takes
its
meaning
from
wonderful
craftsmanship
offerings
like
the
otis
oatmeal
stout
dwhats
the
abv
like
six
percent
hell
yeah
ill
have
another
the
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
and
the
dry
back
end
of
this
brew
make
it
easily
sessionable
especially
in
december
abouttosnow
temperatures
overall
this
was
not
an
overly
complex
take
on
the
style
however
it
was
a
solid
take
imo
i
would
recommend
it
but
not
above
a
few
other
brews
in
the
category
pours
a
murky
brown
tan
head
oddest
color
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
for
a
beer
nose
is
sweet
malts
flavor
is
kind
of
funky
earthy
and
slightly
metallic
edge
malty
flavors
and
a
pretty
thick
aftertaste
feel
is
decent
thick
on
the
liquid
and
a
good
enough
level
of
carbonation
i
am
going
to
drop
the
drinkability
though
on
this
one
sure
its
pretty
good
but
the
funk
edge
on
this
one
is
almost
too
far
out
not
my
favorite
from
sixpoint
looked
good

near
black
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
courtesy
of
the
nitro
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
which
left
nice
rings
retained
well
by
the
pint
glass
smelled
good
like
a
good
stout
should

roasted
chocolate
malts
swirled
with
toffee
the
oats
were
present
if
didnt
come
through
as
much
as
i
like
but
on
the
tongue
the
diacytl
that
produced
that
pleasant
toffee
aroma
was
overwhelming
i
wished
id
ordered
a
second
chelsea
dry
irish
stout
i
didnt
taste
a
whole
lot
here
because
of
the
overwhelming
buttery
flavors
but
theres
some
molasses
and
roast
coffee
going
on
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
despite
id
try
it
again
just
to
make
sure
that
i
didnt
just
get
a
bad
batch
but
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
notes
the
bartender
at
btah
didnt
know
whether
this
was
a
porter
or
a
stout
though
she
did
pour
it
like
you
would
pour
a
nitrotap
guinness
so
at
some
level
she
mustve
thought
it
was
a
stout
or
had
been
trained
to
pour
it
thusly
i
didnt
think
it
was
strong
enough
to
be
a
porter
so
i
was
guessing
at
the
time
that
it
was
an
irish
dry
stout
knowing
now
that
it
was
an
oatmeal
stout
makes
sense
but
i
usually
find
that
oatmeal
stouts
are
a
little
more
creamy
still
this
was
not
bad
at
all
and
id
like
to
try
it
again
knowing
now
what
it
is
id
be
drinking
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
large
cascading
head
great
retention
and
lacing
nose
was
heavy
on
coffee
and
roasted
barley
taste
hits
you
with
a
sweet
sugared
coffee
and
toasty
barley
flavor
also
to
be
found
is
light
caramel
powdered
chocolate
and
mild
hops
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
tasty
pours
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
creamy
tan
head
which
lasts
a
little
while
then
leaves
some
nice
islands
and
some
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
slightly
malty
with
some
caramel
undertones
the
taste
is
malty
and
bitter
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
out
the
taste
was
mostly
dominated
by
hop
character
with
the
oatmeal
roastysugary
flavor
playing
second
fiddle
to
be
honest
the
hops
dominated
the
flavor
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
are
present
but
barely
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
overall
the
beer
is
a
quality
brew
from
a
quality
brewhouse
but
it
doesnt
keep
within
the
style
very
well
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
oatmeal
charcater
in
the
flavor
still
its
worth
a
try

not
much
coming
from
the

just
a
bit
of
coffee
some
semisweet

and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
smooth
and
silky
it
flows
nice
and
you
really
do
not
feel
the
carbonationwhich
i
enjoy
a
lot
of
dark
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
in
the
flavor
and
a
lot
of
flavor
left
to
linger
on
the
palate
very
nice

very
drinkable

delicious

you
have
a

overall
i
really
liked
this
oatmeal

it
fulfilled
my
craving
for
an
oatmeal
stout
in
every
way
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
didnt
have
a
strong
alcoholy
feel
to
it
so
i
didnt
feel
to
guilty
drinking
it
rather
quickly
o
3
75
its
been
years
since
i
had
this
one
great
to
come
back
to
great
value
ill
buy
this

occasion

i
dont

maybe

this
reminds

more
of
a

chocolate
stout
from
all
that
chocolate
flavor
that
takes
the
over
the
remainder
of
the
aroma
in
flavor
but
no
complaints
it
a
really
great
beer
and
for
the
price
at

99
for
a
6

you
cant
go
wrong
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
i
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
burp
unpleasant
choppy
and
foamy
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
tjs
beers
but
the
stockyard
stout
is
a
very
nice
stout
and
a
terrific
value
at
1
per
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
stouts
i
must
say
great
in
every
category
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
was
a
little
too
sweet
even
for
me
reminds
me
of
a
milk
stout
rjt
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
roasted
malt
dominates
with
chocolate
and
coffee
accents
very
good
on
its
own
outstanding
considering
its
price
o
for
a
staple
beer
of
an
oatmeal
stout
this
one
has
to
take
the
cake
trader
joes
has
something
special
here
i
dont
know
how
they
made
such
a
fine
beer
so
cheap
but
please
share
your
magic
with
the
others
so
that
they
can
step
up
their
crap
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
at
a
great
value
ostensibly
this
is
a
cheap
beer
as
its
trader
joes
but
it
packs
a
good
flavor
and
serves
its
purpose
as
a
easy
to
drink
stout
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
and
one
of
my
favs
from
trader
joes
so
far
for
the
price
it
is
an
outstanding
stout
with
a
great
almost
creamy
flavor
it
would
probably
go
best
with
a
dessert
chocolate
and
sweet
than
with
a
meal
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
as
you
can
purchase
single
bottles
from
trader
joes
overall
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
for
a
beer
tasting
party
expecting
it
to
be
good
i
did
not
expect
it
to
be
this
good
a
great
brew
for
a
slow
enjoyable
drink
and
for
the
price
a
real
deal
for
such
quality
i
will
be
buying
this

on

kick
the
last
week
and
had
to
try
this
one
since
it
had
been
a
few
years
full
body
with
a
subtle
coffee
aftertaste
the
flavor
does
disapate
making
it
a
very
easy

enjoy

this
may
be
my
go
to
stout
beer
when
not
drinking
an
ipa
for
the
price
you
cannot
do
any
better
for
an
outstanding
stout
o
this
is
a
nice
one
more
of
a
sweet
stout
than
oatmeal
stout
for
sure
but
a
great
value
at
trader
joes
you
cant
go
wrong
for
the
price
overall
this
is
a
fine
stout
and
one
to
keep
on
hand
imo
in
typical
trader
joes
fashion
this
is
a
mediocre
economical
beer
that
is
easily
forgotten
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
just
come
off
too
thin
for
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
unless
i
am
hosting
a
party
devoid
of
beer
enthusiasts
i
dont
see
purchasing
this
again
also
noteworthy
is
that
it
was
while
opening
a
beer
from
this
sixpack
with
pliers
while
camping
that
i
sliced
my
hand
open
and
got
a
delightful
trip
to
the
appalachian
er
i
suspect
that
scar
will
be
there
for
life
very
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
wik
a
medium
bitter
finish
serving
type
bottle
its
pretty
thin
and
not
exceptionally
smooth
but
easy
to
down
for
sure
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
except
that
i
would
have
liked
if
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
fuller
in
body
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
the
oatmeal
is
also
noted
in
the
flavor
along
with
dark
malts
and
a
smiley
sweetness
not
all
that
bad
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
oatmeal
stout
list
the
verdict
not
bad
smoother
than
many
oatmeal
stouts
but
it
could
use
a
touch
more
raisin
flavor
and
some
hops
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
one
of
the
best
values
for
your
money

youre
in
a
stout
mood

a

pack

carbonation
is

overall
this
is
a
real
winner
nice
buzz
too
after
months
of
no
booze
o
good
but
this
is
nowhere
near
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
its
pretty
basic
really
aside
from
seeming
to
be
a
tad
bit
overcarbonated
cheap
but
the
price
kind
of
makes
it
self
known
via
the
quality
im
not
saying
its
poor
quality
but
its
not
fantastic
either
i
will
say
that
you
can
definitely
tell
that
theres
an
irish
dry
stout
influence
on
this
beer
its
kinda
like
the
cross
between
and
ids
and
an
oatmeal
stout
like
i
said
its
decent
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
end
up
purchasing
this
again
huhits
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
i
have
to
say
im
kinda
surprised
that
it
turned
out
to
be
a
stout
there
is
a
noticeable
lack
of
hops
presence
in
the
smell
flavor
or
feelstockyard
is
exclusive
to
trader
joes
which
would
normally
sound
like
a
cheap
beer
knockoff
but
thats
far
from
the
truth
and
at
6
per
six
pack
this
may
be
the
best
deal
in
town
it
wont
wow
you
but
you
can
buy
cheap
share
openly
and
your
friends
will
think
youve
got
good
beer
tastewhich
is
all
that
matters
i
sorta
dislike
the
acidic
character
but
i
also
sorta
love
this
hahah
very
impressive
for
the
source
good
malt
complexity
and
a
silky
body
the
acrid
character
is
offputting
overall
drinkability
this
was
very
nice
but
not
extraordinary
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
very
black
color
with
a
nice
chocolate
head
the
beer
had
a
deep
roasted
malty
taste
and
smell
but
is
was
way
too
sweet
tasting
the
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
burnt
after
taste
i
will
not
buy
again
overall
i
can
definitely
say
ive
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
not
enough
punch
for
me
o
a
very
well
rounded
beer
with
a
great
balance
of
harmonious
flavors
a
pleasant
oatmeal
stout
albeit
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
a
creamy
smooth
full
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
light
dry
aftertaste
that
brings
with
it
some
of
the
roasted
malt
tastes
and
one
last
note
the
bottle
says
the
abv
is
5
20
the
site
is
not
accurate
in
saying
that
its
5
o
wow
im
actually
impressed
considering
its
only
1
a
bottle
i
hear
through
the
grapevine
this
was
a
goose
island
recipe
they
did
a
great
job
here
making
a
wonderfully
drinkable
stout
while
keeping
to
a
certain
price
point
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
trader
joes
again
definitely
worth
a
try
at
the
very
least
at
6
you
just
cant
go
wrong
and
hey
if
you
dont
want
the
whole

another

one

i
must
remember
what
a
good

standard
american

tastes
like
and
this
certain
falls
into
the
very
good
category
this
beer
is
ridiculous

i

its

black
under

finely
bubbled
tan
foam
cap
the
palate
starts
with
grain
chocolate
light
coffee
and
fruit
the
roast
is
fairly
mild
and
the
beer
starts
with
a
little
sweetness
but
dries
out
with
a
hint
of
sour
on
the
finish
above
average
carbonation
and
a
medium
full
body
very
easy
to
drink
the
smoothness
the
style
is
known
for
is
achieved
in
this
beer
with
little
roast
coming
from
dryness
but
having
enough
heft
and
just
enough
of
a
drier
aspect
to
give
it
the
balance
and
character
it
needs
this
felt
more
like
a
dry
stout
to
me
its
packed
with
dark
welcoming
warmth
plenty
of
roasted
character
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
it
finishes
with
a
complex
offering
of
delicate
malt
sweetness
and
dry
hop
bitterness
and
feel
very
nicely
done
a
lighter
stout
than
i
expected
nice
deep
roast
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
i
predominately
tasted
coco
powder
and
the
oat
meal
its
not
a
sweet
stout
by
any
means
it
is
light
and
leaves
a
very
mild
aftertaste
on
your
tongue
i
almost
taste
a
fruitiness
i
cant
place
after
i
swallow
a
good
stout
if
youre
looking
something
that
isnt
thick
and
rich
feeling
pours

very
dark
brownalmost
black
in
color
with
just
a
thing
beige
head

spotty
lacing
is
seen
with

sip
the
aroma
is

roasted

black
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
actually
even
better
with
the
roasted
maltscoffee
coming
right
though
that
ends
with
a
slight
chocolate
finish
no
bitter
or
harsh
finish
on
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
very
drinkable
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
overall
a
smooth
creamy
and
mellow
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
one
my
first
taste
of
millstreet
great
job
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
sweeter
than
id
optimally
like
but
the
alcohol
moderates
an
ok
brew
up
in
wyoming
mn
on
business
i
always
like
to
try
what
is
local
i
was
very
pleasantly
pleased
with
this
beer
never
heard
of
millstream
brewing
co
very
good
flavor
nice
aroma
good
head
retention
nice
color
smooth
slight
sweetness
good
blending
of
flavors
im
going
to
have
another
overall
tried
this
on
a
whim
because
i
like
supporting
local
breweries
i
think
its
a
good
first
attempt
at
the
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
flavors
just
wish
the
texturemouthfeel
was
a
little
more
substantial
overall
i
figured
i
would
give
this
one
a
shot
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
smell
is
fairly
strong
extremely
nice
leaving
me
to
want
a
bit
more
from
the
taste
i
felt
i
would
say
this
is
an
above
average
oatmeal
stout
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
that
could
possibly
findcome
across
it
millstream
did
such
a
good
job
with
their
version
of
it
that
i
am
now
curious
about
their
other
offerings
i
know
what
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
the
next
time
i
visit
iowa
o
reasonably
decent
brew
that
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
overall
a
nice
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
id
buy
it
again
a
simple
but
excellent
oatmeal
stout
perfectly
balanced
do
all
in
all
goes
down
pretty
easily
with
a
few
off
flavors
present
in
the
nose
and
mouth
not
something
id
recommend
but
not
terrible
either
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
burnt
malt
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
a
bit
stronger
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
mild
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
o
a
rock
solid
effort
that
is
great
for
what
it
is
needs
a
bit
more
complexity
to
be
a
world
class
beer
though
overall
a
very
good
stout
easy
drinking
balanced
and
refreshing
a
great
way
to
introduce
your
guiness
drinker
to
the
wider
world
of
stouts
notes
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
although
this
beer
does
have
some
body
flavors
are
balanced
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
time
after
time
goes
down
well
with
a
nice
dose
of
paul
bley
solo
piano
music
or
pink
floyd
take
your
pick
o
its
a
perfectly
fine
beer
but
not
a
beer
that
im
likely
to
remember
fairly
tasty
but
relatively
pedestrian
45
mouthfeel
is
almost
medium
or
maybe
medium
fairly
nice
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
with
a
low
abv
like
this
its
not
an

stout
thanks
to
crass3000
for
this
one
i
gave
this
a
4
5
overall
and
4
0
for
smelll
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
4
5
on
appearance
overall
i
really
like
this
i
will
probably
not
be
able
to
drink
this
again
until
i
if
ever
come
back
to
amana
if
you
come
to
amana
visit
the
colonies
and
visit
millstream
they
have
a
lot
of
other
beers
for
you
to
try
also
the
place
has
a
sample
bar
as
well
as
a
sitting
room
you
can
watch
the
brewery
there
give
this
one
a
try
next
time
ur
in
amana
iowa
or
order
it
smooth
to
drink
which
is
not
surprising
for
an
oatmeal
stout
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
bitter
finish
i
have
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
but
am
always
glad
to
try
each
oatmeal
stout
i
can
find
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
in
all
categories
the
biggest
draw
back
is
the
mouth
feel
that
doesnt
quite
get
it
done
and
it
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
that
the
complexity
of
the
nose
doesnt
translate
as
well

o
very
pleased
with
this
one
good
flavor
and
interesting
profile
after
an
afternoon
of
raking
leaves
this
is
really
hitting
the
spot
will
definitely
buy
again
this
is
a
good
stout
im
liking
stouts
more
and
more
give
this
a
try
overallnice
representation
of
the
style
and
well
done
this
was
one
id
drink
again
recommended
poured
intomy
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
viscous
black
with
a
decent
3
inch
tan
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
ring
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
no
lacing
sticks
around
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
astringent
coffee
mixed
with
bitter
sweet
chocolate
the
flavor
profile
is
much
the
same
bakers
chocolate
mixed
with
astringent
coffee
just
a
little
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
dry
has
a
cocoesque
dryness
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
creamy
not
your
normal
oatmeal
stout
overall
its
good
beer
but
nothing
crazy
i
would
have
liked
it
tobe
just
a
bit
ceeamier
pours
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
thinned
to
a
layer
leaving
little
bits
of
lacing
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
malt
aromas
it
has
a
roasted
malty
taste
burnt
bitter
black
coffee
flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
was
medium
body
and
silky
smooth
it
was
a
perfect
sessionable
stout
a
nice
surpise
here
o
average
has
a
couple
things
going
for
it
and
a
couple
that
arent
sum
of
the
parts
is
something
some
will
like
and
some
will
pass
on
in
favor
of
more
exotic
beers
this
stout
is
surprisingly
refreshing
without
compromising
much
of
the
taste
its
roasty
and
smooth
overall
i
am
fairly
impressed
its
a
good
lighter
bodied
stout
i
just
prefer
more
body
and
creaminess
d
this
is
just
a
good
beer
and
im
quite
happy
with
that
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
oatmeal
stout
nice
flavor
and
the
feel
is
textbook
for
the
style
its
also
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
have
this
one
again
i
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
one
i
would
seek
out
again
the
next
time
im
in
iowa
d
decent
offering
for
some
reason
i
didnt
like
the
first
few
drinks
but
after
that
it
was
pretty
good
good
full
flavor
millstream
is
not
trying
to
innovate
here
they
seem
to
be
committed
to
making
solid
traditional
beers
for
a
very
local
consumer
base
if
thats
what
the
people
of
amana
iowa
want
then
millstream
seems
up
to
the
task
of
fulfilling
that
desire
back
road
stout
is
a
simple
reminded
that
basic
beers
are
still
something
worth
appreciating
overall
delectable
goes
great
in
place
of
afternoon
tea
cookies
drinkability
a
solid
stout
and
right
down
my
alley
loads
of
body
and
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
sensations
this
one
deserves
a
place
on
the
mantel
dear
drinkability
yeah
not
feeling
this
the
metallic
taste
is
just
so
distracting
i
cant
enjoy
this
beer
my
drinking
it
now
reminds
me
that
this
is
how
the
beer
tasted
a
year
ago
and
age
did
not
improve
this
that
is
why
i
didnt
review
it
then
i
wanted
to
let
it
sit
for
a
bit
oh
well
a
swing
and
a
miss
taste
definitely
chewy
and
the
alcohol
was
no
longer
as
omniprescient
sic
as
it
was
in
the
aroma
came
off
as
smooth
more
coffee
and
caramel
to
it
than
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
did
develop
a
little
more
bitterness
than
usual
with
the
use
of
oats
but
i
guess
when
you
have
a
coffee
feel
youre
gonna
get
some
bitterness
usually
notes
a
nice
easy
to
drink
stout
with
plenty
of
nice
stout
flavors
not
overly
bitter
nor
overly
complex
but
well
balanced
and
tasty
this
is
a
very
nice
basic
easy
to
drink
stout
not
outstanding
but
good
ok
the
label
is
confusing
the
shit
out
of
me
it
looks
like
a
guy
putting
the
moves
on
grandma
at
a
barn
picnic
while
the
dog
is
watching
wtf
is
going
on
in
that
picture
very
solid
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
md
pretty
drinkable
i
suppose
smooth
mouth
feel
very
slick
d
very
drinkable
abv
is
probably
4
5
making
this
crushable
the
flavor
is
good
but
id
like
to
see
just
a
little
something
else
something
light
to
boost
the
complexity
a
bit
d
the
richness
could
limit
the
amount
consumed
but
overall
quite
nice
for
an
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
has
a
grain
and
oil
mix
upfront
combined
with
chocolate
the
middle
presents
a
subtle
chocolate
giving
way
to
more
deep
roasted
grains
and
a
little
coffee
the
finish
is
smooth
dry
and
a
little
bitter
from
the
almost
burnt
grain
flavor
another
good
beer
i
wish
was
available
in
chicagoland
but
alas
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
little
chocolatetoffeecaramel
notes
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
much
with
some
nice
sweetness
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
brew
this
ones
got
good
flavor
but
its
not
too
well
rounded
falls
into
the
realm
of
average
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
with
some
nice
flavors
i
prefer
my
stouts
to
have
a
little
more
body
tastes
of
roasted
malt
coffee
toffee
caramel
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
mocha
flavors
slight
hint
of
grains
which
i
assume
to
be
the
oatmeal
a
very
malty
and
enjoyable
stout
for
those
who
like
coffee
since
the
roasted
malt
flavor
dominates
this
brew
has
a
grainy
feel
to
it
where
the
maltoatmeal
almost
feel
like
its
leaving
a
residue
yet
its
a
dry
finish
good
tasty
stout
that
goes
down
easy
like
water
its
worth
trying
this
beer

i
have
a
number
of
other
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
would
rather
have
if
offered
i
would
drink
again
but
not
my
first
choice
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
even
trying
to
put
the
hometown
bent
aside
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
quality
beer
wellplayed
millstream
bom
from
june
2009
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
slick
oil
like
color
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
did
not
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
chocolate
and
some
sweet
raisin
mild
malts
and
some
yeast
the
taste
falls
flat
and
is
not
as
bold
as
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
this
is
an
ok
stout
but
i
have
had
better
this
beer
was
served
with
a
nice
transparent
blackdark
red
hue
it
was
not
cloudy
and
had
a
off
white
head
the
first
one
tasted
of
the
darkest
chocolate
and
coffee
i
had
ever
tasted
the
second
sweetened
up
slightly
with
more
of
an
herb
character
it
was
a
very
smooth
beer
but
not
to
the
extent
of
some
lagers
and
lighter
ales
keeping
an
adequate
mouth
feel
i
dont
know
why
the
first
one
tasted
different
but
i
preferred
the
first
the
second
beer
i
had
was
probably
closer
to
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
overall
good
beer
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
one
wile
getting
used
to
the
really
dark
beers
d
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
dont
love
it
yet
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
the
color
of
cola
with
a
half
inch
khakicolored
head
that
crackled
and
popped
as
it
slowly
dissipated
into
a
fairly
solid
quarter
inch
skim
nose
is
fairly
subdued
but
suggests
molasses
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
acidic
dark
fruit
in
the
back
taste
follows
nose
but
theres
also
a
slightly
metallic
quality
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
mediumbodied
and
a
little
overly
effervescent
for
the
style
a
little
watery
and
somewhat
lacking
in
consistency
decent
brew
but
some
of
the
qualities
are
a
bit
offstyle
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
what
i
expect
in
an
oatmeal
stout
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
ive
had
worse
but
ive
had
better
pours
black
with
an
amber
color
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
14
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
oatmeal
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
oatmeal
stout
mouth
feel
is
coarse
and
sharp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
strong
bitterness
associated
with
the
roasted
malt
tastes
of
roasted
malt
up
front
slight
hop
background
sweetness
of
the
oatmeal
and
slight
coffee
in
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
the
bitterness
level
is
too
high
and
the
head
retention
is
negligent
though
overall
crisp
clean
and
chock
full
of
flavors
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
for
an
oatmeal
stout
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
liked
but
not
harsh
either
flavor
is
of
mild
roasted
cocoa
some
bready
malts
and
some
faint
bitterness
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
not
bad
but
not
that
great
thanks
to
akokandy
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
couple
bottles
of
this
ive
knocked
another
state
of
my
list
the
beer
is
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
it
has
a
sweet
and
a
bit
roasty
character
to
the
aroma
but
there
isnt
much
else
apart
from
that
the
taste
is
quite
different
maybe
the
fact
that
it
is
aparently
lagered
according
to
the
bottle
it
is
definitley
very
sweet
and
estery
it
also
has
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
as
well
it
is
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
and
it
has
pretty
good
drinkablility
d
easy
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
the
lager
yeast
really
makes
the
beer
more
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
stout
to
friends
why
is
this
beer
lagered
i
feel
like
bottle
conditioning
an
ale
would
have
produced
a
great
complexity
and
more
evenkeeled
mouthfeel
not
bad
overall
though
overall
thanks
go
out
to
buckeyenation
for
this
generous
hook
up
the
bottle
says
colony
oatmeal
stout
lager
that
makes
absolutely
no
sense
but
whatever
this
beer
was
good
not
like
a
life
changing
beer
but
definately
drinkable
and
worth
drinking
again
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
thin
mocha
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
roast
chocolate
and
licorice
taste
is
quite
roasty
some
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
a
lingering
coffee
roast
in
the
finish
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
ample
carbonation
this
is
a
great
little
stout
simple
for
what
it
is
but
highly
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
one
immensely
on
a
side
note
the
bottle
claims
that
this
is
a
lager
i
wonder
if
that
is
true
thanks
buckeyenation
for
the
opportunity
d
good
stuff
nothing
to
complain
about
here
this
smooth
drinking
stout
does
everything
right
an
nothing
wrong
i
like
the
cookie
dough
ice
cream
notes
i
dont
think
ive
ever
mentioned
that
in
any
other
review
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
that
appears
black
in
the
glass
with
mahogany
tints
around
the
edges
the
head
is
small
but
dense
and
fades
quickly
leaving
only
hints
of
lacing
the
smell
is
dominated
by
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
distinctive
as
the
smell
but
does
have
a
little
more
sweetness
in
the
form
of
molasses
up
front
then
its
more
of
the
roasted
coffee
and
malts
with
a
slightly
bitter
coffee
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
thin
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
though
im
not
sure
what
the
lager
label
is
about
either
way
nothing
distinctive
but
not
too
bad
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
session
stout
it
would
be
the
colony
md
kind
of
thin
i
would
not
sit
down
and
drink
2
or
3
of
these
this
is
an
once
in
a
while
want
a
change
of
pace
beer
da
decent
stout
for
anyone
wanting
a
change
from
average
dry
stoutsbutnot
one
that
i
will
revisit
on
purpose
pous
a
nice
dark
black
with
a
lasting
soft
and
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
metallic
but
nicely
raosty
and
some
ash
sweetness
and
coffee
as
well
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
coffee
soft
oatmeal
creaminess
and
a
medium
roastiness
and
light
body
drinks
very
easily
but
not
too
thin
still
pretty
good
and
i
actually
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
more
than
expected
i
felt
it
was
pretty
underrated
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
almost
black
on
the
pour
and
appears
nothing
but
in
the
glass
and
has
a
one
finger
effervescent
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
just
a
thin
layer
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
what
you
might
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
roasted
barley
coffee
and
chocolate
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
the
slight
sweetness
of
chocolate
malt
being
countered
with
an
unexpected
bitterness
roasted
notes
are
quite
prominent
and
there
is
a
slight
oxidation
present
which
hurts
the
taste
score
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
the
carbonation
is
more
aggressive
than
creamy
a
pretty
decent
stout
overall
not
the
best
but
ive
definitely
had
worse
drinkability
using
a
lager
yeast
for
an
oatmeal
stout
though
it
could
be
considered
an
exercise
in
creativity
did
not
serve
the
final
product
well
at
all
or
hell
it
may
just
be
an
infected
bottle
either
way
this
is
one
poor
beer
taste
is
where
it
wimped
out
a
bit
solid
oaty
of
chocolate
coffee
and
malt

but
on
the
weak
side
still
decent
and
tasty
good
priced
at

a

drink
er
down
purchased
at
sids
dubuque
ia
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
this
is
from
a
bottle
that
i
got
well
over
a
year
ago
in
a
beer
of
the
month
club
i
reviewed
it
elsewhere
and
am
not
comparing
this
beer
to
then
too
it
seems
to
have
smoothed
out
somewhat
but
its
still
an
opaque
black
it
poured
now
as
then
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
nothing
no
lace
nice
aroma
of
black
fruit
licorice
dark
malts
roasty
and
just
a
bit
yeasty
big
licorice
in
the
flavor
with
some
of
the
other
aroma
components
too
not
bad
finish
is
a
typical
stout
not
bad
nothing
special
drinkability
aok
a
nice
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
another
nice
brew
from
millstream
i
am
impressed
by
what
i
have
tried
so
far
update
tried
another
one
from
another
location
and
enjoyed
it
much
better
the
downfalls
i
described
before
were
not
apparent
the
only
drawback
is
still
overcarbonation
with
active
fizzing
on
the
tongue
much
better
flavor
i
bumped
my
scores
for
taste
drinkability
mouthfeel
stays
put
pours
with
a
small
dark
brown
head
that
disappears
in
a
few
seconds
deep
dark
brown
in
color
appears
almost
black
smells
fantastic
with
a
strong
nutty
chocolaty
aroma
very
smooth
to
drink
with
very
low
carbonation
levels
starts
like
a
dry
stout
with
many
different
characteristics
taste
like
a
chocolate
covered
macadamia
nut
with
dry
oatmeal
flavors
finishes
with
just
a
small
amount
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
finish
last
sometime
and
begins
to
have
a
strong
earthy
nutty
taste
definitely
know
this
is
a
oatmeal
stout
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
not
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
but
then
again
its
from
iowa
nothing
about
iowa
is
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
p
black
color
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
of
cocoa
and
roasty
with
some
hops
perceived
as
well
nice
but
could
have
been
stronger
there
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
sourness
in
the
taste
but
luckily
the
roastiness
overpowers
it
quickly
and
leads
you
to
a
tasting
of
oats
and
cocoa
in
the
finish
lower
carbonation
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
i
could
definately
see
myself
having
more
of
this
could
be
improved
in
some
areas
but
is
a
pretty
good
local
stout
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
the
stout
poured
a
soda
colored
black
after
a
very
vigorous
pour
i
still
didnt
get
much
of
a
head
and
what
i
did
get
came
and
went
by
very
quickly
the
nose
was
s
ubtle
marriage
of
burnt
malts
and
chocolate
malts
the
flavor
began
and
danced
with
a
malty
chocolatieness
with
a
dry
finish
it
was
a
surisingly
light
mouthfeel
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
the
flavor
saves
it
and
makes
it
a
very
decent
oatmeal
stout
this
is
one
of
the
dark
colored
ales
that
i
could
sit
and
session
with
but
not
necessarily
spend
time
amazed
by
its
flavor
pours
a
deep
brownblack
quite
opaque
dont
see
much
light
going
through
at
all
good
carbonation
a
little
head
around
the
edge
creamy
nose
was
extremely
smoky
with
a
lot
of
coffee
up
front
a
bit
too
much
after
sitting
a
little
bit
the
intensity
subsided
and
a
balance
was
achieved
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
acridness
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
was
the
same
way
crazy
amounts
of
overly
smoky
coffee
almost
burnt
and
then
subsiding
as
it
sat
for
a
short
time
becoming
creamier
but
still
maintaining
a
hefty
coffee
toasty
flavor
alcohol
peeks
through
again
altogether
could
be
quite
good
the
balance
is
decent
but
the
alcohols
break
the
flow
a
bit
dthis
is
good
a
good
selection
for
the
winter
i
think
very
deep
black
color
with
a
very
slight
head
on
top
low
aromasome
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
bitter
smell
mellow
roasted
flavor
with
some
chocolate
going
on
slight
bittersweet
after
taste
ok
enough
body
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
i
am
confused
by
the
label
stating
its
a
lager
but
an
oatmeal
stout
for
me
it
suffers
an
identity
crisis
a
notch
above
average
solid
onyx
short
espresso
crema
head
of
medium
bubbles
that
quickly
settles
to
a
skim
coat
no
carbonation
streams
are
visible
slightly
charred
oatmeal
both
sweet
and
charcoal
dominates
but
is
still
relatively
restrained
an
initial
smoky
roastedness
fills
the
mouth
the
oatmeal
comes
on
but
not
as
smooth
or
creamy
as
expected
and
has
trouble
standing
out
against
the
deep
roasted
notes
the
finish
is
of
slightly
bitter
roast
malt
and
it
is
short
and
compact
the
palette
is
left
surprisingly
clean
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
a
thin
petite
body
this
could
use
just
a
bit
more
oomph
but
that
is
just
to
be
picky
nicely
carbonated
enjoyable
and
a
solid
offering
nice
drink
i
know
its
not
too
far
and
i
would
give
this
to
friends
as
a
transition
beer
into
other
types
of
beer
that
are
labeled
dark
beers
by
uneducated
drinkers
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
clean
not
creamy
at
all
is
this
due
to
it
being
a
lager
instead
of
an
ale
aside
from
the
only
negative
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
it
just
isnt
an
outstanding
beer
12
ounce
bottle
millstream
oatmeal
stout
pours
out
a
not
quite
black
color
with
a
small
brown
head
roasted
chocolate
in
the
aroma
with
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
and
smooth
although
some
astringency
comes
in
at
the
finish
lots
of
chocolatey
flavor
just
a
touch
of
hoppiness
drinkability
is
pretty
good
according
to
the
bottle
this
is
a
lager
but
i
cant
taste
how
this
differs
from
a
regular
oatmeal
stout
not
overly
roasty
but
this
still
a
decent
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
the
best
of
the
millstream
sampler
i
just
tried
id
slip
a
sixer
of
this
into
my
winter
rotation
if
this
was
availabe
in
my
area

was
good
in

i
planned
to
bring
some
bottles
home
with
me
from
the
brewere
but
unfortanetly
they
were
out
at
the
time
colony
oatmeal
stout
pours
dark
brown
like
any
other
stout
with
a
shortlived
tan
colored
head
its
aroma
is
warm
and
comforting
with
strong
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
sweet
combination
of
caramel
and
chocolate
nice
a
strong
coffeelike
aftertaste
fades
quickly
earning
this
brew
above
average
marks
in
the
drinkability
category
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
and
perhaps
an
excellent
introduction
for
quaffers
new
to
the
style
of
their
best
beers
it
pours
totally
dark
duh
with
a
mild
tan
foam
some
hints
of
browntinged
light
shine
though
reluctantly
aroma
is
bready
with
heavily
creamed
coffee
mild
and
certainly
not
pungent
scent
flavor
is
also
very
mild
and
refreshing
reminds
me
of
an
iced
coffee
with
most
of
the
ice
melted
some
mocha
notes
as
well
as
butterscotch
and
toffee
in
the
end
warmth
brings
out
carob
and
date
flavors
rich
buttery
tastes
mix
in
a
mild
way
yielding
a
lighttomedium
body
oatmeal
flavor
not
predominant
but
adds
a
certain
doughy
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
beer
and
par
for
course
appears
blavk
as
night
and
poured
a
nice

is
leaving
no

discreet
taste
has
coffee
overtones
is
smooth
but

dry
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
an
outmeal
stout
should
be
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
this
is
good
perfect
beer
to
help
me
relax
pours
very
dark
in

kind
of
like
cold
coffee
thin
brown
head
aroma
is
slightly
coffee
and
just
a

bready
the
flavor
is
very
strong
in
roasted
barley
i
like
it
nice
flavor
dark
chocolate
flavor
too
the
hops
are
there
and
bring
out
a
nice
peppermint
tone
the
oatmeal
come
across
in
the
mouthfeel
and
i
almost
want
to
chew
this
beer
other
than
that
it
is
fairlyfull
bodied
just
a
tad
watery
and
full
of
good
flavors
notes
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
thin
compared
to
most
stouts
but
this
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
its
supposedly
using
lager
yeast
regardless
of
whether
it
is
to
style
or
not
its
a
very
tasty
beer
maybe
the
lager
yeast
choices
help
this
beer
attain

this
one
says
its
an
oatmeal
stout
lager
what
the
heck
is
that
anyway
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
in
it
very
pleasing
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
the
chocolate
and
roasted
taking
the
front
slight
sweetness
and
the
body
is
thick
and
creamy
very
enjoyable
drinkability
is
great
as
well
don
youre
a
champ
this
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
color
with
just
a
hint
of
light
showing
at
the
edges
there
is
a
small
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
top
of
the
brew
the
nose
is
nice
with
a
healthy
roasted
and
slight
chocolate
character
the
flavor
is
good
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
chocolatey
sweetness
and
a
slight
burnt
roasted
quality
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
this
brew
is
rather
nice
i
like
the
nose
and
the
flavors
i
would
have
this
one
again
very
good
show
overall
a
lightly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
beermuch
lighter
than
i
expected
given
its
rich
color
overall
easy
to
drink
and
plenty
of
flavor
id
even
consider
eating
this
with
some
japanese
food
a
fine
clean
stout
on
a
pairing
note
dark
chocolate
makes
an
excellent
companion
for
this
beer
but
only
in
small
amounts
because
something
too
rich
could
overwhelm
the
beer
a
fine
lagered
stout
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
had
this
one
easily
competes
with
any
stout
from
bells
a
reasonable
oatmeal
stout
a
bigger
body
would
help
significantly
the
concept
of
an
oatmeal
stout
lager
is
intriguing
as
well
very
clean
and
milky
this
defines
smooth
in
a
stout
full
flavored
malty
chocolate
malted
milk
ball
type
flavors
with
just
a
bit
of
roasted
flavor
through
the
finish
its
pretty
straightforward
as
a
chocolatey
milky
oatmeal
stout
with
decent
carbonation
and
its
incredibly
drinkable
a
surprisingly
good
treat
thanks
don
drinkability
an
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
stout
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
id
definitely
recommend
it
it
is
a
nice
fallback
session
stout
around
these
parts
since
it
is
widely
available
in
this
area
mouthfeel
has
a
silky
smooth
creaminess
to
it
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
lively
on
the
palate
this
is
a
stout
that
i
wouldnt
mind
sessioning
with
and
is
a
nice
suprise
as
i
just
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
while
i
was
in
iowa
recommended
i
emailed
the
brewery
and
they
suggested
the
off
taste
came
from
the
fact
that
i
had
an
8month
old
bottle
since
they
dont
pasteurize
their
beer
thats
past
its
prime
i
will
definietly
buy
more
fresh
beer
and
revise
my
review
at
a
future
date
12
oz
bottle
obtained
from
to
your
health
coralville
in
janurary
2005
and
consumed
that
same
evening
freshness
date
says
november
pours
thick
and
silent
with
a
halffinger
brown
head
and
with
a
chocolate
smell
appears
utterly
pitch
black
even
when
held
up
to
a
light
smell
has
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
takes
a
while
to
take
hold
chocolate
and
coffee
run
around
playing
tag
in
my
mouth
first
one
dominates
then
the
other
what
an
interesting
experience
hazelnut
comes
in
late
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
roasty
body
is
medium
heavy
and
carbonation
is
strong
too
heavy
for
the
style
imo
the
flavors
are
really
wellbalanced
in
this
beer
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
ever
had
this
is
my
first
experience
with
an
oatmeal
stout
i
must
say
being
an
iowa
native
i
am
quite
surprised
to
see
that
a
state
with
such
a
strong
love
affair
for
sissy
yellow
beer
could
produce
such
a
deliciously
black
nectar
this
was
my
third
favorite
of
millstreams
product
line
when
i
took
the
tour
earlier
today
it
pours
quite
dark
with
a
small
tan
head
tastes
almost
like
a
guiness
but
not
quite
as
dry
or
harsh
while
i
can
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
it
would
not
be
my
choice
for
a
medium
to
heavy
session

superiors
sir
duluth
overall
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
that
would
make
a
great
session
beer
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
that
ive
ever
had
sweet
malt
upfront
not
roasted
and
bitter
just
a
hint
of
coffee
and
toffee
mixed
with
and
oaty
aftertaste
really
nice
but
not
very
complex
or
strong
good
mouthfeel
but
not
great
and
like
i
said
this
is
the
most
drinkable
stout
that
ive
ever
come
across
dark
brown
with
the
usual
millstream
fizzy
and
shortlive
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
chocolate
and
roast
with
a
bit
of
oatmeal
the
flavor
is
fairly
big
but
comes
across
as
a
bit
thin
the
body
is
really
watery
for
the
style
and
unsatisfying
despite
the
flavor
being
pretty
good
this
brewerys
best
beer
is
definitely
the
johns
generations
an
excellent
witbier
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
the
trade
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
that
lets
a
little
light
through
thin
beige
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
not
much
lacing
until
further
down
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
mainly
of
coffee
as
well
as
a
touch
of
malt
mediumbodied
with
a
milky
texture
roasted
coffee
malt
and
a
touch
of
tart
fruit
in
the
flavor
the
finish
is
smooth
with
a
lightly
bitter
character
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
here
just
a
runofthemill
oatmeal
stout
you
can
find
anywhere
taste
is
far
too
sweet
it
has
tart
tangy
tones
that
arent
doing
it
for
me
lots
of
malt
and
oat
sweetness
thats
becoming
uncomfortably
close
to
winelike
for
an
oatmeal
stout
dark
cherry
and
some
charred
wood
notes
actually
make
a
way
in
towards
the
finish
but
the
sweetness
here
is
over
the
top
for
me
perhaps
this
has
gotten
past
its
prime
the
smell
maybe
eludes
to
what
it
may
have
once
existed
in
flavors
but
this
is
a
sweetified
tangy
mess
no
matter
how
hard
i
try
i
cannot
enjoy
this
bottle
looked
and
smelled
promising
but
the
taste
promised
nothing
but
an
overly
sweet
twang
of
undrinkable
soda
pop
syrup
backwash
quite
an
interesting
beer
labelled
as
a
lager
you
would
hardly
know
it
but
for
the
slightly
diluted
body
and
perhaps
the
simple
flavor
profile
still
it
provides
a
good
deal
of
flavor
and
enjoyment
in
a
tight
refined
package
a
fine
local
choice
millstream
colony
oatmeal
stout
is
a
good
version
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
locally
after
tasting
this
beer
i
guess
this
beer
caught
me
off
guard
just
being
a
beggining
beer
drinker
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
darker
beers
personally
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
nutty
taste
it
had
an
almost
coffee
dark
taste
to
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
darker
beers
this
one
will
be
the
one
for
you
its
tastes
are
complex
enough
for
a
dark
beer
fan
call
it
a
stout
or
call
it
a
dark
lager
colony
oatmeal
stout
is
one
fine
beer
this
beer
is
a
completely
black
beer
with
a
small
brown
head
on
the
top
the
smell
is
of
clean
lagered
water
and
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
bit
peculiar
clean
lagered
chocolate
pretty
sweet
a
tad
bitter
and
something
else
possibly
some
fruit
it
just
seems
a
bit
confused
something
about
it
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
dark

color
small

is
mildly
choolate

the

not

me

once
again
but
with
enough
hop
presence
to
not
make
this
too
cloying
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
brew
overall
it
was
alright
but
with
so
many
great
stouts
out
there
i
highly
doubt
that
id
have
it
again
overall
this
is
an
ok
oatmeal
stout
tasty
while
you
drink
it
but
completely
forgettable
once
finished
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
but
im
not
going
to
look
for
it
either
reviewers
are
selling
this
one
short
overall
pretty
bad
even
for
the
amazing
discounted
price
i
bought
it
for
i
may
sit
on
this
one
for
a
year
or
so
and
see
if
it
mellows
i
hesitate
to
review
infected
beers
and
i
am
quite
sure
this
is
not
supposed
to
be
moderately
tart
and
lactic
hopefully
someday
i
can
revisit
this
beer
but
it
probably
wont
be
anytime
soon
had
this
beer
at
my
hidden
gem
after
work
one
nite
taste
goodok
for
an
oatmeal
stout
i
finished
wanting
a
left
hand
milk
stout
but
was
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
for
the
location
and
the
time
i
had
to
sit
and
relax
with
this
beer
its
okay
for
an
oatmeal
stout
it
has
a
floral
scent
when
opened
and
poured
but
also
carries
a
slightly
bitter
after
taste
o
not
sure
if
its
bad
bottles
or
poor
beer
but
ive
recently
had
3
of
these
from
nimbus
crossing
2
styles
i
wont
be
finishing
this
one
t
light
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
coffee
throughout
nothing
really
beyond
that
that
i
get
mouthfeel
doesnt
really
show
much
effect
of
the
oats
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
theres
really
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
one
pleasurable
if
unremarkable
didnt
get
the
oatmeal
smoothness
so
much
seemed
more
like
a
dry
stout
o
decent
stout
a
little
too
astringent
for
me
12

pours
clear
nearly
opaque

color
with
a
1

with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a

that
lingers

clings
down
the

aromas
of
chocolate
roasted

nice
and

with

with
a

and
fairly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
almost
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
well
balance
with
nice
flavor
robustness
and
complexity
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
everything
one
would
want
in
the
style
smooth
creamy
chocolaty
good
one
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oats
and
cocoa
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
for
the
style
overall
an
okay
stout
for
a
reasonable
price
good
for
those
beer
drinkers
who
are
not
used
to
or
dont
like
stouty
stouts
in
other
words
its
a
gateway
stout
o
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
stout
and
those
who
get
this
year
round
should
feel
lucky
luckily
we
have
river
horses
oatmeal
stout
thats
very
similar
to
this
from
what
i
can
remember
but
unfortunately
its
only
a
seasonal
for
us
smoky
earthy
aroma
has
nutty
yeasty
and
hoppy
hints
it
pours
a
beautiful
opaque
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
and
persistent
tan
head
that
leaves
some
generous
lacing
sublime
flavor
has
smoky
roast
malt
coffee
nutty
earthy
and
toffee
notes
of
varying
prominence
quite
tasty
texture
has
good
body
and
fizz
not
fullbodied
but
still
impressive
heartily
recommended
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
is
lower
this
isnt
a
very
good
stout
oatmeal
no
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
so
is
the
whole
beer
executionwise
im
not
impressed
o
average
oatmeal
stout
flavors
had
a
burnt
taste
lingering
to
them
not
to
complex
either
still
an
ok
drink
just
not
my
favorite
overall
a
mild
mildtasting
beer
thats
just
plain
boring
i
wasnt
asking
for
much
i
wasnt
but
come
on
nimbus
give
me
something
to
work
with
drinkability
more
interesting
than
other
stouts
such
as
guiness
but
the
olive
character
while
not
bad
is
not
exactly
appealing
id
call
it
an
off
taste
that
reduces
drinkability
unless
this
was
being
paired
d
it
goes
down
smooth
though
the
aftertaste
would
grate
on
me
after
more
than
a
few
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2001
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
very
dark
almost
completely
black
with
a
1
finger
brown
and
gray
head
aroma
is
equally
malty
and
roasty
flavor
is
rich
and
smooth
with
plenty
of
malty
backbone
to
balance
all
the
usual
dark
roasty
notes
medium
creamy
body
hop
character
is
hidden
but
this
beer
isnt
really
sweet
it
is
balanced
enough
very
drinkable
and
hits
all
the
right
notes
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
though
not
as
rich
as
i
like
easy
to
drink
a
few
on
a
cold
night
verdict
a
solid
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
yet
another
reason
to
visit
nimbus
if
youre
in
southern
az
this
stout
is
a
great
example
of
how
oatmeal
stouts
should
be
made
even
according
to
seasoned
tasters
so
im
glad
i
was
able
to
learn
to
appreciate
the
type
of
brew
with
the
nimbus
micro
being
that
it
is
so
aromatic
and
robust
it
would
be
best
paired
with
a
hearty
smoked
steak
and
a
chocolate
dessert
both
of
which
will
help
to
bring
out
each
of
the
individual
flavors
in
the
very
end
this
is
a
beer
i
can
most
certainly
appreciate
but
one
i
most
likely
wont
be
drinking
unless
i
have
both
a
nice
slab
of
smoked
ribeye
and
a
fudge
brownie
with
walnuts
drinkability
not
bad
complexity
but
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
good
beer
in
general
and
if
you
like
bitter
stouts
this
one
would
be
fun
to
have
hanging
out
in
the
fridge
done
of
my
early
favorites
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
after
all
this
time
i
should
make
this
one
more
of
a
habit
had
this
one
traveling
around
the
grand
canyon
a
solid
if
generally
unremarkable
oatmeal
stout
that
got
significantly
better
as
it
warmed
up
best
was
around
room
temperature
coffee
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
dominated
the
nose
and
taste
overall
worth
a
look
especially
if
you
like
the
style
pours
an
opaque
black
with
ruby
highlights
moderate
coffee
head
falls
fairly
fast
no
lace
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
roasted
bitterness
taste
is
fairly
simple
sweetness
overlaid
with
a
roasted
character
not
particularly
chocolate
or
coffee
just
roasted
finish
is
bitter
and
long
lasting
something
a
little
off
that
i
cant
quite
figure
out
mouthfeel
is
starts
thin
as
its
cold
but
gets
nice
when
it
warms
smooth
and
silky
i
think
this
is
a
quality
oatmeal
stout
its
not
an
award
winner
but
definitely
recommended
for
at
least
a
try
overall
a
very
good
bottled
oatmeal
stout
but
could
be
better
with
more
oats
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
could
be
paired
nicely
with
toasted
rye
bread
and
melted
sharp
cheddar
over
potatoes
i
will
have
anotherfive
more
in
my
fridge
now
after
allbut
although
theres
nothing
exactly
wrong
with
it
theres
also
nothing
that
really
stands
out
here
and
puts
it
on
par
with
say
sam
smiths
oatmeal
offering
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
from
nimbus
and
one
that
i
could
drink
pretty
regularly
if
it
was
available
to
me
worth
a
try
sometime
d
not
earth
shattering
but
good
glad
to
review
an
arizona
beer
besides
cave
creek
chili
beer
thanks
tomas
for
the
huge
box
of
beer
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
this
stout
appears
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
about
a
finger
of
creamy
ecru
colored
foam
the
head
quickly
ebbs
leaving
no
lace
nose
and
flavor
are
of
medium
roasted
grains
semisweet
chocolate
earthy
hops
and
a
touch
of
molasses
this
medium
bodied
stout
is
a
tad
chewy
from
the
addition
of
oatmeal
and
is
adequately
carbonated
for
the
style
worth
a
try
if
you
are
an
oatmeal
stout
fan
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
very
tight
head
about
one
inch
that
slowly
faded
as
the
beer
did
smelled
faintly
of
roasted
malt
and
toasted
oats
tasted
like
a
dark
stout
with
hints
of
roasted
toasted
oats
fairly
consistent
with
the
aroma
body
is
pretty
good
and
not
too
heavy
it
was
a
tasty
beer
for
the
climate
this
is
perfect
however
it
does
lack
some
fullness
in
the
flavor
profile
that
prevent
it
from
taking
the
next
step
considering
the
climate
this
is
very
drinkable
d
not
one
i
will
be
craving
but
definitely
a
beer
i
could
have
one
or
two
of
pours
was
weak
and
watery
watery
being
a
common
theme
with
this
beer
the
smell
had
some
dry
chocolate
maybe
a
hint
of
fruit
and
molasses
but
in
all
honesty
no
real
smell
of
note
taste
was
much
of
the
same
watery
watery
watery
hints
of
flavors
but
no
real
actual
flavor
just
a
really
bad
example
of
the
style
it
was
watery
and
perhaps
worst
of
all
just
plain
boring
blah

the
acrid

in

finish
i
would
call
the
mouthfeel
the
coup
here
not
much
as
far
as
nose
and
flavor
but
it
sure
has
a
nice
heft
d
its
ok
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
one
i
think
that
this
bottle
might
have
been
a
bit
off
as
it
didnt
have
the
fullness
that
i
would
have
come
to
expect
of
a
stout
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
more
oatmeal
tastes
and
something
more
full
thick
i
think
that
ill
give
it
another
shot
if
i
get
the
opportunity
milky

of

with
milk

is
like
cocoa
puffs
with
oats
and
some
coffee
very
thin
mouthfeel
i
mean
really
thin
mouthfeel
this
is
a
stout
right
smooth
but
nothing
special
pours
with
a
decent
viscosity
not
too
thick
and
not
too
thin
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
very
little

what
little

does
appear
instantly
recedes
back
into
the
blackness
hints
of
roasted
coffee
emerge
on
the
nose
but
not
much
else
taste
is
similar
although
it
tastes
like
watered
down
coffee
very
thin
not
very
interesting
and
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
because
of
this
the
beer
goes
down
pretty
easily
and
thus
drinkability
is
up
as
well
but
for
less
than
ideal
reasons
honestly
im
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
one
sorry
to
say
it
but
this
was
a
let
down
below
average
drinks
easily
enough
due
to
its
completely
ordinary
profile

more
carbonation
would
have
blasted
through
the
empty
body
of
the
beer
making
it
even
less
desirable
pretty
drinkable
beer
that
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
down
not
bad
d
thanks
to
tayner
for
a
very
good
oaty
stout
if
this
was
local
i
could
drink
these
to
replace
the
one
troegs
took
away
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
minor
mouthfeel
gripe
aside
and
its
far
from
a
fatal
flaw
if
even
a
flaw
at
all
id
say
this
one
is
more
than
solid
across
the
board
this
was
my
first
time
venturing
into
arizona
brews
and
it
was
a
nice
first
step
would
like
to
see
and
try
more
from
nimbus
an
easy
recommendation
a
serviceable
stout
with
some
roasted
coffee
grinds
drinkable
dark
brown
with
no
head
some
coffee
grind
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
more
bitter
than
sweet
malt
or
chocolate
flavour
quite
minimal
appropriate
carbonation
almost
like
a
nitro
tap
in
a
bottle
d
all
in
all
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
nice
aroma
and
flavor
modest
abv
too
i
could
see
having
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
its
one
id
have
again
from
a
beer
style
i
do
enjoy
good
job
nimbus
pours
black
as
coal
nearly
impenetrable
to
light
the
slightest
ruby
tones
around
the
bottom
of
the
chalice
nice
tan
head
with
awesome
lace
smells
of
dark
malt
charcoal
and
coffee
bean
the
first
taste
is
of
burnt
oak
and
malt
followed
by
coffee
bean
and
a
little
bitter
bite
at
the
end
slight
bitter
chocolate
tones
mouthfeel
is
good
but
a
touch
thin
drinkability
is
good
and
easy
a
great
brew
the
first
of
nimbus
ive
tried
so
far
im
a
fan
overall
a
solid
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
stout
pours
near
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
that
dies
down
rather
quickly
leaving
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
drinking
this
the
first
time
i
was
distracted
by
a
strong
astringent
smell
that
also
lingered
in
an
aftertaste
the
second
one
i
had
the
next
day
had
a
more
mild
astringent
taste
which
i
attributed
to
an
overdone
smoke
flavor
the
typical
chocolate
and
coffee
profiles
are
found
in
this
stout
i
would
have
expected
a
little
more
head
retention
from
an
oatmeal
stout
thanks
goes
to
tayner
for
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
always
liked
the
label
drinkability
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
and
the
slight
sourness
adds
interesting
complexity
but
im
glad
i
sampled
it
now
as
it
might
detract
soon
i
suspect
the
beer
might
be
a
little
dated
as
the
label
has
a
notch
between
june
and
july
and
it
is
now
december
d
i
have
never
been
a
huge
stout
drinker
but
sine
it
is
winter
i
am
drinking
more
and
more
and
starting
to
enjoy
them
more
and
more
this
is
a
stout
that
making
me
start
to
enjoy
them
i
would
defentaly
have
to
buy
this
one
again
and
again
d
not
sure
if
this
bottle
of
past
its
prime
but
i
really
dont
think
so
idk
maybe
i
was
expecting
a
samuel
smiths
dont
think
ill
try
this
one
again
pours
an
absolute
black
with
a
thin
half
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
layer
of
almost
nothing
stickiness
is
pretty
minimal
with
a
tiny
bit
of
spottiness
on
the
sides
smell
is
of
molasses
toasted
oat
and
french
roast
coffee
for
some
reason
i
detect
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
too
and
for
a
5
5
abv
im
not
liking
it
a
whole
lot
taste
is
a
smokey
espresso
flavor
with
a
tiny
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
some
toffee
flavors
emerge
on
the
tongue
with
a
woody
taste
as
well
aftertaste
is
a
dry
vanilla
flavor
with
some
oak
as
well
one
of
the
smokier
oatmeals
ive
had
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
light
creamy
body
with
a
subtle
but
enjoyable
carbonation
i
really
enjoy
how
this
one
feels
after
the
initial
appearance
and
smell
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
my
first
beer
from
nimbus
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
good
solid
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
very
thick
black
but
it
develops
almost
no
head
this
beer
resembles
more
of
a
dry
stout
than
a
fullflavored
oatmeal
stout
its
not
what
i
set
myself
for
but
it
does
the
job
the
overall
score
suffers
because
i
think
its
merely
solid
for
an
oatmeal
stout
finish
is
long
and
caramel
sweet
d
good
a
good
stout
i
enjoyed
it
while
watching
the
movie
stagecoach
on
tcm
nimbus
had
made
some
good
brews
will
have
to
try
more
of
them
didnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
one
pours
black
with
a
respectable
tan
head
that
fades
to
acap
and
laces
moderately
the
smell
is
surprisingly
robust
and
complex
especially
given
the
relatively
low
abv
coffee
roasted
grains
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
oloroso
sherry
are
all
present
the
taste
is
significantly
lighter
but
echoes
of
the
aromas
are
present
there
is
also
a
slight
grainy
sourness
thin
chocolate
and
a
little
roastiness
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
slightly
creamy
and
on
the
lighter
side
goes
down
easily
but
could
be
a
tad
more
robust
to
sustain
interest
this
oatmeal
stout
when
poured
was
so
dark
brown
that
it
was
on
the
verge
of
being
black
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
there
was
also
a
hint
of
simisweet
chocolate
the
taste
was
of
deeply
roasted
malts
hops
and
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
while
drinking
this
stout
it
had
a
bittertart
dryness
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
finish
just
an
interesting
one
along
with
the
aroma
and
flavor
ok
but
nothing
spectacular
d
this
is
a
decent
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
the
thinness
brings
it
down
a
bit
notes
not
for
me
lacks
a
solid
body
and
lacks
in
depth
a
good
oatmeal
stout
to
me
needs
to
be
easy
drinking
but
not
at
the
expense
of
character
this
is
easy
drinking
but
d
way
to
strong
in
the
coffee
flavor
for
me
i
prefer
a
bigger
oatmeal
flavor
in
a
oatmeal
stout
dark
oatmeal
stout
brown
with
a
dark
sandy
brown
head
that
laces
nicely
chalky
chocolatey
malt
notes
with
sweet
milk
and
roasted
peat
nice
lightly
roasted
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
sweet
milk
chocolate
oats
and
sugared
coffee
bitterish
finish
fullbodied
creamy
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
easily
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
if
you
like
dark
stouts
this
one
is
for
you
probably
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
good
stuff
good
drinkability
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
toasted
stout
it
has
some
dry
irish
stout
qualities
to
it
lots
of
flavor
for
its
managable
abv
level
but
it
is
definately
filling
me
up
already
so
id
be
limited
on
how
many
of
these
i
could
really
have
if
i
had
the
chance
for
this
out
west
id
be
first
in
line
wish
it
had
a
lil
ring
of
goodies
on
the
bottle
bottom
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
small
creamy
tan
head
some
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
slightly
roasted
sweet
malts
some
hops
and
slight
chocolatecoffee
the
taste
is
very
nice
sweet
malty
with
some
under
tone
chocolatecoffee
medium
body
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
true
to
style
oatmeal
stout
beer
poured
jet
black
with
a
fine
tan
head
that
is
leaving
lacing
behind
nose
is
slightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
a
fine
balance
between
chocolate
malts
oats
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
satisfying
from
the
oats
but
is
not
as
thick
as
hoped
drinkability
is
very
good
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
in
the
future
the
drinkability
is
good
a
good
example
to
the
style
right
on
prosit
mk
d
yummy
but
more
of
a
stout
than
an
oatmeal
stout
high
bitterness
but
drinkable
though
i
think
it
missed
the
style
also
the
carbonation
was
too
high
i
wouldnt
turn
this
away
though
this
was
pretty
darn
good
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
certain
would
even
buy
it
if
available
a
very
drinkable
classic
oatmeal
stout
good
session
fare
especially
for
a
stout
and
would
also
make
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
also
comes
at
a
great
price
if
only
it
was
available
locally
i
could
see
this
being
something
i
kept
on
hand
d
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
goes
down
pleasantly
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
and
would
definitely
buy
and
drink
again
d
good
offering
glad
i
got
to
try
it
my
first
offering
from
nimbus
and
a
definite
winner
a
must
try
this
beer
is
dark
there
is
no
light
getting
through
there
is
a
tan
head
that
quickly
tapered
off
this
beer
is
thick
as
well
the
smell
is
very
malty
the
taste
backs
this
up
there
is
virtually
no
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
no
bitterness
the
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
is
heavy
and
filling
a
good
beer
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
but
the
aroma
is
mild
thought
that
isnt
a
problem
with
the
style
deep
black
with
thumb
thick
mocha
head
very
bitter
and
acidic
in
the
fore
with
ample
coffee
notes
middle
is
a
lessened
version
of
the
fore
taste
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
finish
which
is
cream
and
sugar
espresso
and
chocolate
tasty
and
fun
to
drink
pours
a
very
dark
color
almost
completely
black
head
is
brown
dark
khaki
leaves
a
good
lacing
and
head
retention
is
nice
tastes
very
smooth
and
light
although
it
is
a
heavy
beer
little
texture
little
carbonation
taste
hints
of
coffee
which
balances
well
overall
this
is
a
very
mild
beer
which
is
very
good
if
you
want
to
drink
something
with
flavor
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
as
a
session
beer
but
theres
nothing
besides
the
superior
taste
that
would
keep
it
from
being
one
i
think
this
is
my
new
favorite
from
nimbus
at
least
of
their
regular
releases
ive
had
it
a
number
of
times
on
tap
before
this
but
never
quite
took
the
time
to
really
notice
how
good
it
is
i
think
a
bit
part
of
my
sudden
awareness
comes
from
the
glass
im
using
all
of
the
great
smells
it
has
simply
dont
come
through
with
a
filledtotherim
pint
glass
beer
is
good
happy
black
stout
beering
id
love
this
before
during
or
after
the
main
course
with
dessert
or
as
a
nightcap
or
just
by
itself
on
a
cold
afternoon
like
today
served
on
tap
in
a
large
mug
very
black
in
color
mediocre
head
that
is
very
tanbrown
they
filled
it
to
the
brim
so
not
sure
how
much
head
would
show
if
it
were
in
a
different
type
of
glass
not
very
overpowering
smell
with
toasted
coffee
aroma
flavor
is
somewhat
chocolatey
and
coffeelike
with
hints
of
berries
and
a
mild
hoppiness
to
round
it
out
its
is
very
dry
and
has
a
decent
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
great
nice
carbonation
somewhat
thick
but
very
smooth
from
the
oats
its
filling
but
very
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
nimbus
the
nose
is
predominantly
of
dark
chocolate
the
bidder
sweet
flavors
of
this
stout
are
balanced
very
well
coffee
and
chocolate
along
with
toasty
oat
flavors
are
all
present
rather
big
and
very
round
the
stout
feels
good
in
the
mouth
a
long
dry
finish
gives
it
a
refreshing
character
found
in
good
dry
stouts
a
very
worthy
and
drinkable
stout
i
would
have
had
another
but
i
decided
to
try
the
porter
next
ill
definitely
have
another
in
the
future
this
stout
poured
an
opaque
brownblack
color
with
sudsy
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
nice
and
included
aromas
of
oatmeal
roasted
barley
and
a
hint
of
coffee
together
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
was
foremost
dark
roasted
malt
with
some
burnt
overtones
and
a
taste
of
oats
there
was
an
underlying
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
licorice
and
a
trace
of
coffee
the
hops
were
hidden
by
the
maltiness
but
there
was
some
hoppiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
with
medium
full
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
the
lingering
aftertaste
was
full
or
dark
roasted
flavor
and
was
dry
this
was
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
which
held
up
well
in
the
growler
but
someday
i
would
like
to
have
it
fresh
from
a
tap
for
comparison
a
pitch
black
brew
that
has
a
tan
to
brown
head
atop
of
it
smells
of
roast
malt
and
it
tastes
quite
smooth
with
a
mellow
roast
malt
finish
a
very
silky
smooth
body
to
this
beer
lots
of
malt
flavors
and
a
bit
of
acidity
in
the
finish
a
good
solid
beer
there
are
no
super
strong
flavors
a
good
thing
and
it
is
very
well
balanced
what
can
i
say
as
i
love
stouts
since
my
first
sip
of
a
guinness
at
st
james
gate
some
25
years
ago
ebony
color
on
the
pour
creamy
dark
chocolate
head
that
is
modest
in
size
the
lace
a
nice
glutinous
cover
upon
the
glass
starbucks
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
fresh
toasted
grain
and
quite
pleasing
to
the
schnozzle
is
this
nose
start
is
sweet
and
thickly
malt
with
the
top
full
and
creamy
finish
has
a
bittersweet
chocolate
aftertaste
the
acidity
moderate
the
hops
purposeful
in
their
spicy
bite
and
a
terrific
representative
to
the
style
and
a
sure
fire
favorite
for
this
stout
lover
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
bitter
malty
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
example
of
what
you
can
do
with
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
disappointed
twice
now
on
this
stuff
i
know
it
is
rated
high
and
everyone
has
different
taste
buds
mine
are
just
not
firing
here
i
would
like
to
have
pulled
a
few
more
aroma
and
flavor
notes
out
here
it
is
one
step
up
from
a
guinness
extra
stout
for
me
but
no
more
will
not
venture
to
this
again
this
is
my
goldstandard
for
oatmeal
stouts
it
is
so
good
i
almost
dont
want
to
drink
it
every
oatmeal
stout
has
something
some
quality
that
i
would
adjust
in
some
way
except
this
one
perfect
absolutely
fantastic
beer
this
brewery
knows
stouts
like
big
time
taste
got
better
and
sweeter
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
a
glass
not
too
much
chocolate
or
coffee
mainly
oats
great
looking
beer
would
buy
again
nice
head
good
smell
of
english
yeast
the
front
is
malt
yeast
and
roast
every
now
and
then
i
get
the
slightest
hint
of
raise
on
the
first
drink
when
there
is
still
good
head
when
held
to
light
in
a
pint
glass
it
is
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
you
can
see
through
it
a
quality
i
always
appreciate
nice
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
as
a
patty
stout
should
be
its
a
great
beer
in
my
top
5
stouts
wow
this
stout
blew
me
away
pours
black
with
a
slight
layer
of
tan
foam
its
a
traditional
oatmeal
stout
which
means
its
perfect
for
any
time
of
the
day
particularly
breakfast
the
low
abv
makes
it
easy
to
drink
without
getting
drunk
and
adds
to
its
smooth
quality
fantastic
beer
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
very
smooth
i
am
a
quad
drinker
so
for
my
first
oatmeal
stout
i
dont
really
have
any
other
to
compare
it
too
im
like
stronger
beers
but
this
is
pretty
damn
smooth
and
refreshing
a
friend
shared
this
with
me
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
very
smooth
and
mildly
chocolately
no
real
coffee
flavor
which
was
nice
in
my
judgment
but
there
are
a
lot
of
good
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
however
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
purchase
aroma
of
oats
and
hint
of
chocolate
subtle
notes
of
molasses
taste
is
medium
dry
with
a
small

creation
at

i
suppose
this
is
the
difference
between
an
english
and
american
stout
but
this
beer
didnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
for
what
it
was
tasted
a
bit
thin
and
lacking
but
still
good
i
think
ill
stick
to
imperial
stouts
and
leave
this
one
for
the
traditionalists

nondescript
i
would
not

it
just
to
drink
a
beerid
reach
for
the
organic

with
a
meal
i
would
drink
this

of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
had
o
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
with
a
nice
complexity
and
mouthfeel
to
it
more
like
a
licorice

imperial
pint
glass
today
i
chose
to
give
the
old
oatmeal
stout
a
proper
review
the
beer
pours
with
a
giant
frothy
cappuccino
colored
head
a
full
2
fingers
over
the
top
of
the
glass
picturesque
like
a
root
beer
float
the
awesome
staying
power
of
the
head
lingers
over
a
deep
black
liquid
with
slight
transparency
and
cherry
accents
a
distinct
but
mellow
browned
butter
aroma
greets
the
nose
along
with
hints
of
raisin
smoke
and
minerals
the
flavor
is
of
mildly
sweet
butterscotch
with
subtle
sour
bitterness
limelike
spiciness
meets
a
roasted
character
with
an
herbal
tobacco
taste
in
the
finish
its
a
nice
marriage
of
flavors
but
the
bitterness
though
not
excessive
still
manages
to
overpower
the
malts
a
little
the
brew
is
mediumbodied
with
adequate
carbonation
unremarkable
but
suitable
for
the
style
i
suppose
overall
this
is
a
staple
for
a
reason
theres
quite
a
bit
of
character
packed
in
to
this
tame
abv
offering
from
the
english
legend
if
youve
never
tried
it
its
a
must
have
on
any
beertasting
checklist
dark
heavy
beer
very
smooth
enjoyable
flavorful
stout
but
nothing
special
works
great
as
an
addition
to
chili
however
smooth
pours
well
with
a
thick
foam
top
felt
it
left
something
to
be
desired
for
how
highly
it
came
regarded
best
of
the
best
perfection
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
great
lacing
lots
of
oats
and
nuts
in
the
nose
with
cleaner
in
the
background
upon
first
taste
nothing
other
is
oatmeal
is
present
but
quickly
the
dark
and
roasted
malts
assert
themselves
sweet
milk
chocolate
shows
up
towards
then
end
to
round
out
the
flavor
profile
nice
touch
feels
smooth
carbonated
and
very
very
drinkable
definitely
lighter
than
i
expected
with
almost
zero
bite
overall
this
oatmeal
stout
is
much
simpler
than
other
american

abv
no
syrupy
qualities
or
caramel
notes
and
therefore
can
be
critiqued
for
being
a
bit
twodimensional
but
maybe
im
biased
nevertheless
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
for
anyone
interested
in
getting
into
stouts
worth
every
penny
smooth
creamy
would
buy
again
o
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
very
straightforward
no
flash
because
none
is
required
just
enough
bitterness
to
be
wellbalanced
quite
drinkable
and
with
the
lower
abv
shouldnt
cause
any
problems
to
do
so
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
freshness
always
a
question
oats
and
burnt
chocolate
taste
finishes
on
the
bitter
side
does
not
stand
out

i
might
have
to
try
this
beer
again
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
it
kind
of
left
me
wanting
more
flavor
and
ive
heard
nothing
but
great
things
about
this
beer
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
lol
oatmeal
flavor
is
very
subtle
with
a
hint
hint
of
soy
sauce
nonetheless
drinkable
and
not
terrible
really
solid
oatmeal
stout
doesnt
get
much
better
just
the
right
balance
of
sweetness
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
creamy
head
that
disappeared
quickly
to
a
fine

aroma
was
of
toasted
malts

was
bland
light
in
carbonation
taste
was
bland
as
well
nothing
but
malts
with
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
couldnt
even
finish
this
one
had
to
force
down
the
half
of
a
pint
i
actually
was
able
to
drink
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
nor
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
for
free
highly
disappointed
outstanding

stout
only
knock
i
have
is
the
annoying
foil
at
the
top
of
the

but
the
beer
is
amazing

it

very

perfect

eccellent
i
dont
always
drink
beer
but
when
i
do
its
sam
smith
the
standard
for
oatmeal
stouts
exceptionally
smooth
drinkable
one
of
my
top
3
imports
from
england
this
beer
is
a
reminder
to
all
of
who
invented
the
stout
one
of
the
best
stouts
and
top
3
beers
ive
ever
had
best
god
damn
oatmeal
stout
overall
i
completely
understand
why
this
is
considered
the
standard
for
oatmeal
stouts
smooth
and
sweet
in
addition
to
a
taste
that
has
been
very
well
refined
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
ever
had
my
favorite
beer
it
reminds
me
of
simpler
times
its
simple
so
simple
its
perfect
i
can
drink
this
every
day
at
any
temperature
with
any
meal
this
is
the
definition
of
a
beer
no
bells
no
whistles
nothing
pretty
this
is
beer
it
pours
a
nice
deep
black
color
with
a
caramel
colored
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
slowly
the
aroma
is
that
of
chocolate
and
fresh
bread
taste
is
that
of
chocolate
and
malt
a
nice
spicy
note
comes
in
strong
not
terribly
complex
but
a
great
example
of
a
nicely
rounded
stout
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
sticks
to
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
pleasant
chocolate
note
that
lingers
this
is
a
great
beer
one
that
i
will
be
coming
back
to
in
the
future
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
khaki
colored
head
the
smell
was
full
of
oatmeal
and
malt
with
some
sweet
cream
and
milk
chocolate
in
there
too
the
taste
was
heavy
and
a
bit
decadent
with
a
milkshake
like
consistency
lots
of
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
through
out
overall
was
very
nice
and
very
rich
loved
it
o
a
fine
stout
a
very
fine
stout
ultraorthodox
and
proud
of
the
tradition
it
springs
from
it
offers
a
far
better
option
at
the
price
point
than
many
a
flashier
stout
from
brewers
on
this
side
of
the
pond
what
i
will
grab
when
a
pure
stout
experience
is
what
im
after
pours
a
viscous
thick
syrupy
dark
brown
almost
black
opaque
color
a
tan
head
gives
way
to
a
sticky
lace
that
retains
throughout
aroma
is
intoxicating
an
earthy
roasted
malt
bread
and
hint
of
burnt
sugar
taste
is
grainy
malty
sweet
creamy
with
a
slight
hops
finish
taste
gets
even
better
as
the
drink
warms
i
drank
it
without
food
but
would
love
to
try
again
with
chocolate
feel
is
robust
and
full
bodied
a
meal
in
and
of
itself
active
carbonation
that
settles
as
the
drink
warms
i
loved
this
beer
and
consider
it
an
excellent
example
of
stout
overall
an
excellent
offering
of
this
particular
style
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stows
out
there
and
one
of
the
best
overall
dark
beers
ive
yet
to
taste
far
better
than
other
offerings
such
as
guinness
overall
taken
in
isolation
this
is
an
absolute
belter
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
worthy
of
anyones
time
and
attention
that
said
its
probably
the
weakest
of
the
sam
smiths
stout
lineup
the
imperial
is
my
favourite
but
then
its
up
against
some
pretty
stiff
competition
best
enjoyed
at
your
leisure
this
really
is
too
good
to
just
chuck
down
your
neck
with
wild
abandon
smooth
yet
crisp
nice
beer
for
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
and
welcoming
winter
overall
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
stout
much
more
complex
than
guinness
in
its
array
of
flavors
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
definitely
put
this
as
a
tasty
go
to
oatmeal
stout
never
having
been
a
stout
fan
before
this
beer
was
so
good
its

not

black
it
has
darker
brown
hues
and
from
the
very
middle
of
the
glass
emanating
softly
is
a
shy
ruby
blush
fat
mousse
like

of

is
deep
with

scents
theres
a
sweet
lush
caramel
a
bit
of
weak
coffee
bitter
chocolate
and
some
scent
from
oats
in
the
background
as
well
this
beer
has
an
earthy
woody
scent
too
that
is
hard
to
pin
down
taste
is
luscious
smooth
creamy
and
full
the
sweet
caramel
is
first
to
grace
the
palate
and
then
a
big
roasty
taste
follows
it
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
it
and
it
dries
on
the
tongue
leaving
the
coffee
a
bit
stronger
than
on
the
nose
and
the
bitter
chocolate
to
come
to
finish
at
the
last
moments
there
is
that
woody
and
earthy
taste
again
with
that
sweet
and
very
soft
caramel
to
linger
alongside
all
those
big
roasty
flavors
of
bitter
malt
i
detected
no
hops
on
the
nose
and
i
can
find
none
on
the
palate
save
for
that
bit
of
woodiness
and
to
say
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
a
delight
to
the
disposition
if
you
ask
me
i
like
it
precisely
because
its
not
too
sweet
although
it
has
an
ample
sweetness
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bite
from
carbonation
pleasantly
surprised
i
quite
like
it
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
four
pack
cheers
ow
foam
aromas
of

very
appealing
for
a

exceptionally
tasty
overall
a
very
fine
oatmeal
stout
plenty
of
flavor
light
yet
a
satisfying
meal
in
a
glass
a
classic
and
worth
of
the
considerable
praise
heaped
upon
it
a
classic
that
early
on
helped
me
love
beer
othe
gold
standard
of
oat
stouts
nearly
perfect
pours
a
translucent
black
with
a
light
brown
slightly
white

is
very
sweet
chocolate
grapes
roasted

the
flavor
is
nice

roasty

outstanding
head

and
retention
subtle
nose
of
dark
fruit
plum
raisin
with
light
notes
of
roast
and
chocolate
as
it
warms
light
bodied
with
little
texture
normal
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
laid
back
it
consists
of
a
blend
of
light
roast
and
chocolate
with
a
distinct
mineral
note
if
you
look
for
it
you
can
find
the
oat
character
the
finish
has
a
slight
metallic
twang
to
it
i
suspect
this
bottle
may
be
old
since
what
im
tasting
is
nothing
like
the
other
reviews
here
if
you
dont
bother
to
bottle
date
then
the
reviewer
cant
take
age
into
consideration
overly
malty
with
a
burnt
taste
i
would
also
expect
and
hope
that
an
oatmeal
stout
would
be
very
smooth
this
beer
could
barely
be
described
as
smooth
it
also
has
a
harsh
finish
that
you
would
expect
from
a
bitter
pale
ale
stouts
should
be
easy
to
drink
in
my
opinion
there
is
a
faint
taste
of
chocolate
i
love
this
beer
big
malt
with
coffee
and
chocolate
greeting
you
with
each
smell
and
gulp
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
a
tang
to
it
kind
of
like
coffee
that
youve
brewed
but
let
it
sit
in
the
pot
until
it
cooled
it
works
for
the
good
in
this
case
ill
get
this
again
of
course
o
i
typically
look
for
a
higher
abv
fuller
mouthfeel
stout
when
im
drinking
in
the
colder
months
but
this
is
perfectly
suited
for
the
change
of
seasons
it
would
also
be
great
for
a
cold
night
when
you
plan
to
have
more
than
a
couple
beers
in
short
its
a
great
go
to
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
almost
black
in
color
with
a
good
3finger
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
left
lots
of
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
coffee
and
some
oats
the
taste
is
fantastic
with
lots
of
good
favor
from
the
above
said
items
very
smooth
with
no
bitter
finish
i
can
drink
this
one
when
it
is
0
degrees
or
90
degrees
outside
nice
smooth
finish
with
no
bitterness
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
always
a
favorite
and
a
perfect
10
for
me
overall
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
is
certainly
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
this
style
i
was
too
amazed
to
pay
attention
to
anything
but
the
experience
good
thing
i
have
another
in
the
fridge
my
second
favorite
beer
i
love
this
stuff
my
first
taste
of
the
famous
oatmeal
stout
amazing
body
flavor
and
finish
want
more
samuel
smith
knows
how
to
make
the
oatmeal
taste
dance
around
your
taste
buds
and
the
smoothness
to
it
makes
you
think
its
a
coffee
drink
not
a
beer
love
the
smell
after
you
take
a
sip
of
it
near
your
nose
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
of
it
the
malt
flavors
are
not
over
powering
and
coats
your
mouth
with
a
sticky
film
that
makes
me
love
this
stout
so
much
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
stout
to
anybody
who
would
love
trying
a
stout
for
the
first
time
this
is
the
single
finest
tasting
oatmeal
stout
i
have
ever
enjoyed
incredible
oatmeal
stout
o
this
is
truly
a
world
class
beer
its
incredibly
balanced
there
is
nothing
that
i
would
change
about
it
great
smooth
not
too
pricey
o
a
superb
oatmeal
stout
probably
havent
had
one
better
ss
you
guys
are
the
bomb

i
can
see
why
this
is
a
classic
delicious
light
and
drinkable
very
nice
stout
this
is
topoftheline
beer
paradise
a
thick
hearty
porridge
that
is
somehow
as
easy
to
quaff
as
a
light
lager
beautiful
to
the
eye
and
a
delight
to
the
palate
this
is
as
good
as
it

the
holy
grail
of
oatmeal
stouts
great
oatmeal
stout
perfect
balanced
nice
aroma
full
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
o
i
have
seen
this
in
the
store
for
a
while
ut
have
never
thought
to
pick
it
up
very
nice
beer
my
absolute
favorite
oatmeal
stout
i
can
drink
a
ton
of
this
oneto
me
far
less
filling
than
most
stouts
large
550ml
bottle
poured
in
an
official
samuel
smith
pint
glass
dark
color
pretty
much
black
a
very
think
foamy
head
that
dissipates
very
very
slowly
and
clings
to
the
glass
creamy
taste
extremely
smooth
subtle
sweet
chocolate
flavor
with
a
tough
to
describe
earthy
complexity
i
am
surprised
at
how
easy
to
drink
this
was
rich
smooth
and
creamy
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
pricey
but
worth
it
imo
oaky
at
first
but
mellows
out
over
time
pretty
good
this
is
about
a
good
as
you
can
do
dark
roasty
sweet
smooth
a
tan
head
that
follows
you
all
the
way
down
the
glass
i
remember
the
first
one
of
these
i
ever
had
it
was
like
opening
my
eyes
for
the
first
time
there
isnt
a
lot
that
can
be
said
about
samuel
smith
besides
wow
and
yes
please
also
considering
there
are
a
couple
of
bars
here
in
omaha
where
you
can
get
a
pint
for
under
5
it
is
a
nobrainer
go
to
beer
o
not
as
good
as
taddy
porter
but
a
solid
beer
non
the
less
overall
a
really
excellent
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
needs
a
little
more
nose
to
it
but
an
excellent
stout
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
maybe
the
best
sessionable
stout
i
have
come
across
and
im
glad
i
can
easily
find
it
at
my
local
grocery
store
its
even
on
sale
from
time
to
time
i
do
wish
i
could
find
it
on
tap
more
though
all
of
samuel
smiths
dark
beers
are
impressive
and
i
suggest
everyone
try
them
at
least
once
one
of
the
best
things
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
the
oatmeal
really
gives
it
that
silky
texture
that
i
love
in
my
dark
beers
this
is
also
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
when
i
was
getting
in
to
craft
beer
back
when
i
wasnt
really
into
ipas
overall
excellent
beer
last
time
i
drank
this
was
as
dessert
after
a
steak
topped
with
blue
cheese
crumbles
so
i
remember
it
being
sweeter
the
previous
time
i
had
it
o
im
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
i
usually
like
my
stouts
a
little
bigger
than
this
but
i
have
to
say
that
the
drinkability
of
this
is
without
a
doubt
unmatched
and
given
how
popularavailable
this
is
itll
find
its
way
back
into
my
fridge
for
sure
overall
i
had
the
taddy
porter
and
this
back
to
back
and
find
the
two
very
similar
with
this
having
a
oat
character
of
course
less
dark
fruit
and
a
more
pronounced
chocolate
and
toffee
character
both
are
solid
offerings
if
a
little
light
however
ss
do
make
some
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
had
i
prefer
this
over
the
porter
but
ill
stick
with
the
imperial
stout
over
both
of
these
for
now
next
up
is
the
nut
brown
ale
pitch
black
in
color
with
tan
head
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
taste
has
many
layers
coffee
chocolate
toffee
cream
soy
sauce
nicely
carbonated
this
is
an
outstanding
stout
taste
and
smell
are
both
very
complex
ill
definitely
pick
up
a
few
of
these
next
time
i
see
it
all
in
all
its
a
nearly
perfect
beer
and
its
great
availability
makes
sss
oatmeal
stout
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
and
the
standard
which
other
oatmeal
stouts
are
measured
by
it
was
the
first
oatmeal
stout
i
ever
tasted
and
have
not
found
one
that
even
comes
close
hearty
and
not
too
sweet
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
heaven
i
dont
get
any
real
hop
presence
on
the
flavor
piece
of
this
beer
and
there
is
no
alcohol
either
generally
sweet
and
malty
from
start
to
finish
with
this
one
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
feels
great
and
tastes
good
definitely
worth
buying
if
you
are
a
malty
poured
a
rich
deep
opaque
black
with
dark
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
when
held
to
light
and
three
fingers
of
thick
tan
head
that
receded
slowly
and
left
abundant
lacing
down
the
glass
an
excellent
stout
appearance
exactly
what
you
look
for
in
the
style
scents
of
soy
sauce
roast
malt
notes
of
dark
chocolate
hard
yorkshire
water
and
samuel
smiths
yeast
as
it
sits
chocolate
aromas
become
more
prominent
alongside
some
faint
hints
of
coffee
and
roast
malt
there
is
also
a
low
level
of
floral
hop
aromas
a
very
good
balanced
wonderfully
presented
oatmeal
stout
aroma
flavor
begins
with
a
semisweet
flavor
profile
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
with
roasted
malt
undertones
and
notes
of
coffee
with
cream
moves
into
a
more
bitter
flavor
though
still
with
an
underlying
slight
sweetness
and
a
greater
flavor
of
roast
malt
finishes
semidry
with
a
roast
malt
presence
and
notes
of
coffee
with
cream
aftertaste
is
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
hint
of
nuttiness
from
the
oats
there
are
slight
earthy
notes
throughout
mingling
with
the
roasted
malt
flavors
a
very
nice
overall
flavor
profile
that
is
complex
and
deep
yet
approachable
and
rustic
very
true
to
style
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
smooth
creamy
slick
feel
very
true
to
form
for
the
style
and
quite
the
wonderful
beer
to
drink
as
a
result
overall
this
is
an
excellent
classic
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
it
hits
the
style
perfectly
from
aroma
to
flavor
to
mouthfeel
and
is
simply
a
joy
to
drink
a
wonderful
beer
o
very
nice
stout
for
someone
who
is
not
a
big
stout
drinker
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
fantastic
tan
head
smells
malty
with
a
slightly
sweet
scent
taste
is
a
nice
very
slightly
sweet
raisin
malt
with
nice
depth
and
flavor
not
too
thick
and
not
too
thin
some
bitterness
at
the
end
but
not
too
much
a
very
nice
beer
very
very
smooth
better
dark
look
that
pours
out
nice
foam
at
the
top
it
has
a
oatmealcaramel
taste
to
it
i
can
have
a
4
pack
of
this
beer
all
day
its
casual
taste
makes
it
very
enjoyable
to
drink
great
stout
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
overall
a
great
stout
for
someone
who
is
new
to
stouts
like
me
not
really
bitter
and
more
sweat
but
it
still
retains
its
stout
characteristics
samuel
smiths
beers
are
the
standard
this
beer
pours
a
dark
liquid
very
little
foam
forms
smell
is
faint
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
really
nice
balanced
malty
bitterness
acidity
is
present
a
bit
of
creaminess
and
dryness
mouthfeel
is
light
easy
to
drink
perfectly
balanced
o
overall
i
must
admit
i
am
slightly
disappointed
after
reading
the
reviews
on
here
it
is
not
bad
but
it
is
also
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
i
might
purchase
again
hard
to
say
probably
not
since
the
store
i
buy
it
from
sells
it
for
3
50
a
bottle
and
i
can
get
a
better
tasting
oatmeal
stout
with
more
abv
at
the
same
price
my
only
complaint
is
how
rapidly
the
head
broke
down
not
sure
if
a
brew
or
ambient
temperature
issue
o
delicious
love
the
finish
and
consistent
flavours
that
dont
try
too
hard
too
impress
they
just
do
this
was
surprisingly
thinner
than
i
expected
but
it
somehow
just
works
for
this
beer
flavor
pick
up
the
oats
chocolate
cocoa
some
licorice
not
as
much
coffee
as
the
aroma
but
there
is
an
astrigent
dryness
in
the
finish
hop
presence
is
in
the
background
of
these
prominent
malts
but
due
linger
in
the
aftertaste
overall
another
good
beer
by
samuel
smiths
and
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
i
love
the
low
abv
in
this
one
its
a
tastefull
delicious
beer
and
at
5
wont
leave
you
crawling
after
such
a
big
bottle
oa
classic
for
a
reason
not
just
a
great
oatmeal
stout
but
a
great
stout
period
a
great
beer
plays
it
safe
in
a
few
categories
but
thats
just
this
stouts
style
good
as
is
poured
from
a
22
into
point
glass
its
dark
to
almost
black
with
a
nice
inch
head
with
little
lacing
really
nice
sweet
malty
smell
it
has
a
great
sweet
caramel
taste
on
the
palate
with
light
roasted
notes
it
has
a
sticky
thick
mouthfeel
with
semi
dry
finish
overall
very
enjoyable
dark
brown
to
almost
black
in
color
an
inch
of
khaki
colored
head
rests
on
top
brussels
lacing
smell
of
oatmeal
is
present
and
yet
a
bit
subdued
i
get
carameldark
maltand
oatmeal
in
the
palate
the
fade
is
a
blend
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
then
back
to
dark
malt
and
caramel
the
mouth
is
dry
and
creamy
a
classic
well
balanced
oatmeal
stout
quoth
the
bard
shall
i
compare
thee
to
a
summers
day
yes
yes
i
will
a
delicious
light
and
fairly
sweet
stout
that
always
goes
down
easy
slight
dryness
on
the
finish
medium
light
body
hint
of
sourness
so
smooth
and
silky
a
favorite
that
helped
get
me
into
craft
overall
im
surprised
this
beer
is
so
low
on
abv
it
smells
and
taste
like
maybe
a
7
0
abv
but
moving
right
along
this
beer
is
damned
drinkable
no
harshness
no
incredible
bitter
or
dry
finish
the
finish
is
just
right
actually
a
little
dry
a
little
hoppy
its
actually
hard
for
me
to
express
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
this
beer
ill
probably
fall
back
to
this
stout
when
i
want
to
drink
a
good
beer
and
a
lot
of
it
well
done
o
patience
is
rewarded
with
this
one
it
is
amazingly
smooth
and
has
a
deep
character
that
comes
out
more
and
more
as
it
warms
great
beer
that
will
be
on
my
short
list
o
a
staple
in
the
stout
category
but
nothing
too
extravagant
simple
yet
elegant
o
prime
example
of
a
stout
however
nowadays
there
are
better
made
ones
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
enjoyed
from
550
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
coffee
brown
brew
with
reddish
tinting
and
a
decentsized
brown
head
aroma
is
rich
and
maltforward
with
cocoa
powder
fruity
yeast
like
apples
and
pears
mediumroast
coffee
and
a
faint
caramel
sweetness
putting
in
appearances
a
wellrounded
sophisticated
and
multifaceted
brew
as
one
would
expect
from
such
a
classic
featuring
chocolate
milk
almond
caramel
vanilla
and
coffee
flavors
with
the
caramel
gaining
traction
later
as
the
dark
malts
lose
some
steam
sourish
and
tangy
from
acidic
dark
malts
and
fruity
yeast
esters
yet
smooth
and
creamy
the
body
is
lighter
than
expected
finishes
long
smooth
and
earthy
with
a
little
butterscotch
and
a
cereal
grain
type
of
sweetness
i
get
little
in
the
way
of
harsh
burnt
or
charred
notes
depending
on
the
source
one
consults
oats
either
fail
to
add
much
flavor
while
contributing
body
or
they
do
add
an
astringent
flavor
note
i
certainly
get
the
latter
here
although
the
source
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
in
my
mind
and
to
my
palate
this
is
considered
the
prototype
of
the
style
for
a
reason
less
sweet
than
a
milk
stout
but
has
some
of
the
same
desirable
mouthfeel
characteristics
absolutely
wonderful
pitch
black
with
creamy
tan
head
great
retention
and
lacing
nose
was
nice
and
roasty
with
cocoa
and
vanilla
taste
followed
delicious
cocoa
coffee
and
a
bit
of
caramel
im
sure
this
would
be
great
over
ice
cream
not
as
heavy
as
i
was
expecting
dont
have
much
experience
with
oatmeal
stouts
but
if
i
tasted
this
blind
i
would
swear
it
was
a
milk
stout
very
delicious
way
to
finish
an
evening
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
taste
is
so
good
and
pretty
complex
for
a
low
abv
i
recommend
this
prost
lampertland
i
have
had
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
perhaps
more
than
any
other
beer
period
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
and
this
beer
provides
delicious
notes
of
both
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
it
leaves
your
tongue
wanting
more
this
is
the
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
with
any
time
of
the
year
paired
with
anything
dark
brown
pour
but
deep
red
hues
appear
when
held
to
the
light
very
good
head
thick
and
foamy
aroma
is
mainly
oatmeal
but
chocolates
flakes
are
also
present
flavor
tapers
off
a
bit
but
retains
the
oatmeal
character
though
not
fullbodied
bit
of
burnt
smoke
hidden
in
there
o
if
you
look
up
oatmeal
stout
noah
webster
should
have
a
picture
of
this
beer
label
next
to
it
that
said
with
the
rise
of
breweries
offering
this
style
it
is
not
the
best
available
anymore
but
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
originals
and
for
that
alone
it
is
worth
checking
out
from
time
to
time
the
first
bottle
i
picked
up
as
a
single
on
the
road
and
was
forced
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
but
it
was
quite
good
a
nice
pleasant
malt
vanilla
flavor
i
was
quite
impressed
however
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
busted
one
out
and
poured
it
in
a
glass
and
it
was
not
quite
as
good
as
the
one
i
had
had
before
possibly
a
bad
bottle
not
terrible
just
not
as
good
still
would
recommend
if
you
can
find
at
a
decent
price
i
think
i
overpaid
at
12
99
a
4
pack
a
decent
brew
though
i
cant
say
it
blew
me
away
looks
spot
on
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
possess
a
blend
of
dark
malt
grain
and
understated
fruity
notes
body
is
ok
yet
could
stand
to
be
more
creamy
goes
down
easily
enough
however
the
distinctive
roastiness
that
id
expect
from
a
stout
is
lacking
the
overall
character
is
too
muted
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
would
have
again
worth
trying
o
damn
sam
smiths
oat
stout
is
beyond
great
this
is
probably
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
thus
far
it
has
an
extremely
flavorful
taste
and
an
awesome
mouth
feel
for
this
price
especially
it
is
more
than
worth
your
money
try
it
this
is
a
classic
brew
it
is
solid
but
im
afraid
not
remarkable
overall
this
is
regarded
by
many
as
a
textbook
oatmeal
stout
i
do
not
necessarily
drool
over
this
beer
but
i
enjoy
it
and
also
recognize
its
significance
in
the
world
of
craft
beer
definitely
worth
checking
out
great
not
overly
bitter
or
sweet
both
have
their
time
to
shine
the
creamiest
beer
ive
had
this
is
not
a
thick
stout
for
contemplating
in
your
mansions
study
this
is
a
beer
for
enjoying
at
the
pub
with
the
game
on
while
talking
with
friends
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
conversation
but
never
the
focus
starts
off
fairly
thin
and
steadily
increases
into
a
full
and
creamy
body
there
is
a
constant
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
which
is
balanced
by
an
earthy
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
sweet
with
roaster
malt
character
and
bakers
chocolate
the
aroma
was
pleasant
and
malty
virtually
no
hops
for
an
oatmeal
stout
i
was
quite
disappointed
in
this
beer
why
would
you
even
make
an
oatmeal
stout
with
only
a
5
alcohol
content
i
wont
say
its
a
bad
beer
but
why
it
gets
such
high
ratings
on
here
i
cannot
understand
why
it
has
high
carbonation
which
is
ok
but
it
lacks
kick
or
punch
that
good
oatmeal
stouts
have
the
head
was
not
very
dark
so
it
just
seemed
weird
to
have
such
a
dark
beer
with
a
light
head
some
people
might
enjoy
this
beer
and
i
think
those
that
do
do
not
like
strong
tasting
beers
if
you
are
looking
for
a
step
up
from
a
guinness
beer
this
might
be
for
you
but
if
you
like
strong
intense
beers
which
i
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
isnt
for
you
taste
follows
the
nose
caramel
malt
punch
backed
by
dark
fruit
raisin
currant
plumb
with
a
slight
floral
hop
bitterness
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
dry
with
subtle
oakiness
oclassic
oatmeal
stout
great
flavor
and
body
deep
dark
brown
in
color
with
dark
red
hues
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
good
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
roasted
malt
sweet
dark
chocolate
toffee
and
cereal
aromas
thick
creamy
smooth
feel
with
subdued
but
tangy
carbonation
at
the
back
end
roasted
and
toasted
malts
with
bready
cereal
flavors
up
front
hop
bitterness
slowly
emerges
through
the
middle
and
expands
to
the
end
converting
the
malt
notes
to
dark
ripe
fruit
flavors
roasted
malt
and
hop
flavors
quickly
exit
from
front
to
back
with
an
incredibly
dry
finish
o
my
first
oatmeal
stout
so
i
figured
id
start
with
one
of
the
best
wasnt
disappointed
plenty
of
sweet
and
malty
flavors
to
keep
your
interest
enjoyable
beer
with
great
taste
nice
and
smooth
o
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
me
o
amazing
simply
stunning
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
great
its
perfectly
balanced
with
hops
and
malts
and
none
overpower
each
other
it
was
a
hell
of
an
experience
drinking
this
beer
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
stouts
or
is
looking
for
one
of
the
best
stouts
out
there
the
perfect
beverage
on
those
cold
winter
nights
when
you
need
something
to
warm
you
up
o
i
think
there
was
a
time
when
this
was
a
comparatively
great
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
measures
up
to
todays
stouts
i
hate
to
rip
on
a
classic
but
there
are
so
many
better
american
stouts
out
there
for
better
prices
the
body
is
fairly
smooth
and
slips
down
far
too
easily
a
very
nice
beer
in
deed
oa
great
flavored
oatmeal
stout
melding
the
big
flavor
of
stout
with
the
mellow
characteristics
of
oatmeal
overall
a
fanatastic
stout
2nd
only
to
old
rasputin
for
me
so
far
but
i
guess
i
should
try
more
oatmeal
stouts
poured
from
a
bottle
into
sa
glass
its
black
with
a
one
inch
head
which
leaves
streaks
as
it
disappears
smell
is
dark
fruit
maybe
prune
taste
seems
bitter
and
coffeelike
at
first
then
it
seems
to
evaporate
in
your
mouth
leaving
a
slight
taste
of
dark
fruit
mf
is
medium
no
alcohol
and
carbonation
noticed
very
smooth
oa
a
tasty
beer
on
the
very
slightly
bitter
side
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
o
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
wanted
to
review
it
having
tasted
it
before
having
said
that
i
liked
the
ipswich
oatmeal
stout
better
i
think
it
had
more
to
offer
and
i
was
left
wanting
another
sip
this
beer
is
outstanding
it
is
just
not
my
favorite
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
nothing
too
offending
or
pretentious
just
solid
o
my
first
my
last
my
everything
this
was
the
first
real
stout
i
had
and
i
always
find
myself
coming
back
for
more
a
classic
that
is
delicious
affordable
and
readily
available
o
superb
an
archetype
of
the
style
highly
drinkable
and
well
put
together
poured
into
a
chilled
but
not
frosted
pint
glass
very
dark
brown
almost
black
medium
head
low
retention
very
roasted
almost
sweet
smell
molasses
smell
perhaps
taste
is
great
hints
of
oats
grapefruit
coffee
and
chocolate
sweet
but
not
in
a
bad
way
slightly
creamy
but
not
thick
very
very
smooth
not
a
session
brew
more
of
a
desert
item
would
be
fantastic
with
meat
stews
or
even
pasta
will
most
certainly
purchase
again
my
advice
serve
this
at
a
cellar
temperature
w
some
meat
and
potatoes
it
will
not
disappoint
a
beautiful
oatmeal
stout
balanced
perfectly
if
not
for
just
a
tiny
bit
of
extra
sweetness
but
i
guess
its
a
matter
of
taste
and
i
loved
it
this
ones
been
in
the
cellar
for
nearly
two
years
dark
brown
nearly
black
pour
with
a
quickly
fading

finger
beige
head
with
minimal
lacing
somewhat
subdued
roasty
nose
with
hints
of
toffee
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
nuts
the
taste
is
roasty
and
nutty
with
hints
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
burnt
toast
tobacco
dark
fruits
toffee
oats
and
some
subtle
vinous
notes
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
and
fizzy
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
it
became
thicker
and
creamier
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
and
this
just
didnt
have
enough
body
for
me
one
of
the
all
time
classic
stouts
and
still
the
standard
bearer
for
oatmeal
stouts
if
you
ask
me
i
do
agree
that
rogues
shakespeare
could
be
the
best
u
s
made
equivalent
but
samuel
smiths
nearly
perfect
stout
still
wins
for
me
usually
it
is
priced
at
an
accessible
rate
where
i
live
ogreat
beer
that
has
many
things
going
on
i
was
writing
notes
all
the
way
to
the
last
drop
outstanding
beer
and
one
that
im
glad
i
revisited
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
16
oz
champaign
flute
builds
a
sturdy
34
head
that
eventually
reduces
to
lovely
lacing
color
is
dark
brown
which
reveals
a
deep
ruby
tinge
when
held
up
to
a
bright
light
aroma
is
rich
and
complex
malt
coffe
and
hops
flavor
is
deep
complex
with
roasted
malt
coffe
hops
a
bit
piney
and
a
little
fig
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
overall
this
is
a
terrific
oatmeal
stout
overall
clearly
a
classic
oatmeal
stout
a
very
good
brew
but
i
prefer
many
other
stouts
awesome
lighter
dessert
like
flavors
in
a
beer
thats
highly
quaffable
the
quintessential
oatmeal
stout
brewers
these
days
are
so
obsessed
with
pushing
the
flavor
and
abv
boundaries
in
stouts
when
this
is
just
as
satisfying
and
not
nearly
as
intoxicating
or
calorie
dense
overall
a
stout
that
makes
you
feel
like
you
want
to
drink
stouts
all
day
whereas
i
have
always
felt
that
stouts
were
situational
but
this
makes
me
feel
that
they
can
be
unilaterally
spectacular
i
get
it
so
many
bas
love
this
brew
and
call
it
their
favorite
samuel
smith
beer
and
i
get
why
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
off
brown
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
coffee
nice
inviting
aroma
tastes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
beer
is
carbonated
right
and
medium
bodied
overall
a
very
good
beer
othis
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
reminds
me
of
why
i
like
lower
abv
stouts
the
smell
immediately
suggests
oats
and
unlike
more
aggressive
brews
the
oats
smell
and
taste
authentic
they
arent
drowned
in
alcohol
or
oak
barrel
the
feel
is
also
a
highpoint
this
is
one
smooth
beverage
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
years
and
it
still
tastes
great
even
when
i
have
mostly
been
drinking
belgian
and
french
beers
lately
overall
a
great
stout
probably
not
the
best
there
is
but
its
definitely
top
tier
i
picked
it
up
in
the
550ml
bottle
and
enjoyed
two
very
enjoyable
glasses
of
it
o
4
good
beer
has
that
distinct
samuel
smiths
taste
however
ive
probably
had
a
few
too
many
imperial
stouts
over
the
last
year
to
ever
want
to
drink
this
one
consistently
its
just
not
as
thick
and
strong
as
i
like
my
stouts
smoother
than
a
babys
bottom
this
is
the
standard
for
an
oatmeal
stout
not
overpowering
in
any
way
just
a
great
example
of
what
a
oatmeal
stout
should
taste
like
try
this
as
your
first
oatmeal
stout
then
decide
what
else
you
want
to
incorporate
into
your
beer
very
good
unexpectadly
smooth
for
a
stout
pours
heavy
and
dark
but
drinks
smooth
and
subtle
with
enjoyable
notes
of
coffee
and
fruit
nice
balance
of
sweetness
just
enough
hops
to
offset
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
overall
great
the
contrast
between
the
rich
color
and
subtle
taste
is
a
great
attribute
can
be
enjoyed
by
most
beer
drinkers
which
is
impressive
for
a
stout
o
samuel
smith
make
some
of
my
favourite
dark
beer
but
this
is
very
unremarkable
i
can
not
understand
the
hype
it
gets
on
ba
forums
o
overhyped
it
is
a
good
beer
just
like
black
butte
porter
is
a
good
beer
but
this
is
not
worth
seeking
out
overall
an
ok
stout
getting
a
lot
of
darksour
fruit
from
it
not
as
strong
coffee
flavor
as
im
used
to
but
not
a
bad
stout
o
my
first
oatmeal
stout
was
expecting
more
of
a
pow
like
a
normal
stout
this
was
very
mild
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
i
really
liked
the
mild
but
slightly
sweet
balance
of
this
beer
and
will
get
more
and
do
recommend
to
my
friends
overall
great
stout
overall
one
of
my
top
3
favorite
beers
the
taste
is
always
consistently
excellent
the
only
negative
with
this
beer
is
the
price
in
the
usa
one
of
the
classic
oatmeal
stouts
still
amazing
even
today
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
had
it
on
tap
in
boston
several
years
ago
and
never
looked
back
undeniably
one
of
the
best
stouts
you
will
ever
drink
smooth
creamy
and
so
good
it
can
be
dangerous
bottles
not
quite
as
good
as
on
tap
so
if
you
can
find
it
in
a
bar
do
not
pass
it
up
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
off
and
on
for
25
years
or
more
sam
smiths
beer
is
a
brand
that
got
me
hooked
on
englishstyle
ales
it
can
be
hard
to
find
in
my
area
and
seems
less
available
now
than
it
was
20
years
ago
oi
definitely
recommend
for
all
stout
drinkers
and
new
drinkers
i
love
this
beer
and
am
sure
to
have
more
congrats
samuel
smith
you
continue
to
amaze
me
my
dad
claims
that
this
is
the
best
beer
that
hes
ever
had
but
ive
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
that
were
made
right
here
in
michigan
i
know
my
opinion
is
an
unpopular
one
but
it
is
what
it
is
s
s
o
s
is
a
drinkable
easytosession
sort
of
beer
but
its
not
how
i
like
my
stouts
its
so
smooth
and
delicious
i
wish
i
could
take
a
bath
in
it
drink
while
eating
a
steak
and
mash
potatoes
or
while
watching
the
game
it
doesnt
matter
you
will
enjoy
it
all
the
same
pours
a
slightly
thick
black
with
a
small
tan
head
mildly
roasted
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
fill
the
senses
along
with
some
sweet
oatmeal
grains
dark
fruity
esters
taste
same
as
aroma
palate
is
a
rich
creamy
body
with
light
carbonation
the
finish
is
sweet
mildly
roasted
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
some
dark
fruity
flavors
with
light
bitterness
on
the
end
for
balance
a
very
good
tasty
and
nicely
balanced
brew
i
like
o
delicious
complex
and
sessionable
what
more
could
you
want
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
i
bought
it
after
i
seeing
it
on
the
shelf
and
reading
the
reviews
and
i
was
definitely
not
disappointed
i
bought
it
in
a
1
pt
2
7
fluid
oz
bottle
and
wish
i
had
gotten
at
least
2
of
them
wonderful
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
was
sad
to
see
the
last
sip
in
the
glass
gonna
go
pick
up
a
couple
of
the
fourpacks
tomorrow
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
or
even
slightly
enjoys
a
good
stout
i
love
stouts
this
is
a
nice
sweet
oaty
flavour
mouth
feel
was
very
full
sweet
dessert
stout
even
though
i
drank
it
on
a
hot
day
and
i
was
drunk
it
happens
samuel
smith
has
made
this
beer
right
only
a
couple
other
stouts
i
would
take
over
this
one
bear
republics
big
black
and
firestone
walkers
parabola
the
mouthfeel
was
ecstatic
and
one
can
really
taste
the
oatmeal
moreso
the
aftertaste
is
like
coffee
like
real
coffee
not
like
kona
brewerys
attempt
at
coffee
beer

lots

if
you
ask
me
o

dont

that

ill
definitely
buy

im
flabbergasted
it
took
me
this
long
into
my
beer

career
to
try
samuel

i
understand
its
popularity
its
got
great
flavor
its
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
smell
it
all

if
i
could
its
now
the
oatmeal
stout
against
which
all
others
will

mouthfeel
first
sip
was

off

stouts

id
try
again
and
again

a
wholesome

english
brew
which
i
definitely
will
be
purchasing
again
overall
nice
example
of
an

stoutmy
only
complaint
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin

beers
ive
ever
had
o
very

samuel
smitsh
oatmeal
stout
is
a
classic
example
of
a
delicious
style
smooth
creamy
and
rich
make
this
an
excellent
dessert
beer
its
black
earth
its
powdered
bark
its
topped
with
raisins
the
modest
5
00
we
hit
just
holds
up
even
higher
the
utter
oddness
of
this
beer
little
can
one
do
to
improve
upon
it
without
creating
entirely
new
beer
styles
and
thats
exactly
what
we
did
very
filling
but
completely
satisfying
pours
black
with
a
big
sexy
cocoa
head
the
nose
is
roasted
malts
raisins
plums
oats
clean
clean
clean
is
the
word
of
the
day
carrying
through
the
flavor
is
a
refinement
and
clean
flavor
and
the
beer
finishes
very
clean
the
oatmeal
creaminess
and
roasted
malt
flavor
shines
in
its
subtlety
and
combines
with
a
slightly
sweet
dark
fruit
flavor
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
desired
normally
but
with
good
carbonation
i
wish
there
was
a
touch
more
assertiveness
in
the
flavor
a
bit
more
roast
or
chocolatiness
but
more
importantly
there
is
a
slight
flavor
in
there
that
i
do
not
like
i
want
to
say
it
is
a
touch
of
sweet
smokiness
dont
hold
me
to
that
but
there
is
something
in
there
that
brings
it
down
a
notch
for
me
regardless
this
is
a
good
beer
o
great
stout
almost
porterlike
in
its
presentation
but
not
quite
as
bitter
or
flat
a
changeup
from
the
russian
imperials
and
a
welcome
dessert
treat
for
me
no
alcohol
to
be
found
anywhere
this
could
be
a
session
beer
no
doubt
different
enough
from
sam
smiths
imperial
stout
so
that
there
is
room
for
both
of
them
in
your
beer
fridge
a
solid
a
for
the
style
very
tough
to
find
a
better
example
at

local

store

but
a

beautiful

towering
about

the
aroma
is
earthy
with
a
hint
of
roasted

and
chocolate
however
rather
bland
and
weak
the
taste
is
light
but
complex
with
a
lot
of
grains
and
a
hint
of
coffee
though
i
must
say
i
felt
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
which
brings
down
the
grade
a
notch
it
is
smooth
to
the
palate
and
makes
a
rather
easy
beer
to
drink
perfect
session
beer
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
with
some
minor
flaws
deeply
recommended
o
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
unfortunately
it
had
the
elements
i
dont
like
about
oatmeal
improper
texture
and
taste
that
at
times
is
pretty
bland
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
definitely
not
in
my
hall
of
fame
just
amazing
full
rich
flavors
with
enough
bitterness
and
carbonation
to
keep
it
in
check
unbelievably
smooth
wow
for
the
price
i
can
only
say
that
this
beer
is
one
of
the
better
choices
on
the
market
ill
be
enjoying
this
for
years
to
come

is
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
i
can
see
why
people
enjoy
this
so
much
still
though
the
random
dark
fruit
notes
i
kept
getting
kinda
killed
it
for
me
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
is
one
of
those
quintessential
stouts
that
may
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
one
of
those
staples
in
the
stout
world
and
i
can
certainly
see
why
this
beer
is
more
than
solid
its
the
embodiment
of
a
stout
o
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
got
me
addicted
to
craft
beer
it
looks
beautiful
in
the
glass
smells
inviting
feels
great
on
the
tongue
and
offers
a
very
complex
and
wellbalanced
flavor
worth
every
cent
d
i
remember
this
one
being
way
richer
in
the
past
maybe
it
is
just
my
palate
but
something
seems
to
be
lacking
still
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
i
like
more
body
on
mine
i
havent
had
this
beer
since
college
but
its
just
as
i
remembered
it
very
easy
to
drink
when
im
in
the
mood
for
stout
i
usually
go
for
something
more
substantial
but
this
is
still
one
delicious
brew
its
very
satisfying
without
being
heavy
or
overwhelming
overall
a
good
rendition
of
the
style
though
honestly
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
crazy
i
have
held
on
to
this
as
long
as
i
have
doverall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
love
that
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
of
oatmeal
but
you
def
still
catch
that
taste
when
you
drink
it
any
body
that
loves
beer
and
coffee
will
love
this
beer
great
beer
samuel
smiths
well
done
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
unoffensive
so
it
was
good
but
at
the
same
time
it
left
me
wanting
a
bit
but
it
was
very
solid
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
to
new
beer
drinkers
to
stouts
and
particularly
oatmeal
stouts
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
would
purchase
it
again
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
buy
another
bottle
or
order
it
on
draft
if
it
were
ever
available
sammy
smith
has
been
around
for
hundreds
of
years
ans
this
is
a
good
staple
from
their
beer
selection
i
am
happy
i
bought
it
tonight
quite
complex
i
enjoyed
the
change
from
other
stouts
nonoatmeal
even
if
i
struggled
to
identify
it
completely
o
overall
it
wasnt
bad
its
a
very
nondistinct
stout
which
is
pleasant
i
wish
it
had
better
character
in
the
scent
because
it
really
detracts
from
the
overall
appeal
getting
a
nose
full
of
metal
when
drinking
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
scent
got
much
better
i
had
this
beer
once
a
long
time
ago
and
remembered
being
a
bit
disappointed
while
not
as
roasty
as
i
tend
to
like
my
stouts
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
was
super
drinkable
and
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
it
is
a
must
try
as
well
as
a
beer
that
i
will
most
certainly
revisit
in
the
future
o
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
is
a
classic
and
is
definitely
like
tasting
a
little
bit
of
history
especially
considering
this
beer
was
reintroduced
nearly
a
decade
before
i
was
born
i
personally
prefer
the
american
oatmeal
stouts
theres
something
about
genuine
english
beers
that
are
cloying
to
me
their
unmistakable
flavor
profile
gets
old
quickly
to
me
for
some
reason
maybe
american
beers
are
just
a
bit
crisper
or
cleaner
whatever
it
may
be
im
happy
to
try
the
oatmeal
stout
by
which
all
others
are
measured
and
im
sure
ill
revisit
it
someday
but
for
now
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
american
versions
overall
pretty
much
the
benchmark
for
oatmeal
stouts
nothing
really
fancy
here
just
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
deep
brown
near
black
colour
slight
off
white
head
light
lace
spots
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
coffee
faint
alcohol
and
subtle
chocolate
notes
there
is
also
a
metallic
presence
that
is
there
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
initially
a
light
chocolate
and
mild
acidity
show
up
after
that
there
is
also
a
light
astringency
in
there
good
mouthfeel
light
creamy
feel
medium
carbonation
drinks
pretty
good
overall
not
my
favorite
but
quite
a
solid
effort
that
is
worth
trying
or
revisiting
excellent
oatmeal
stout
and
one
of
my
favorites
food
pairingpork
any
style
mild
lamb
dishes
yellow
and
other
lighter
flavored
cakes
mellow
chicken
dishes
cream
based
sauces
strong
pastas
like
putanesca
so
soft
and
smooth
in
the
middle
and
finish
just
amazing
mouthfeel
thick
and
creamy
and
delicious
velvety
on
the
tongue
from
the
oats
medium
roast
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
dominating
the
middle
black
figs
and
raising
unmalted
barley
earthy
resinous
hops
on
the
long
droning
finish
a
bit
leathery
and
hints
of
tobacco
great
beer
a
great
beer
that
is
drinkable
and
delicious
o
a
great
smelling
beer
that
really
changes
flavors
with
the
taste
i
dont
get
the
slimy
aspect
of
oats
thats
often
mentioned
so
im
not
sure
if
this
can
really
be
the
benchmark
but
still
delicious
and
enjoyable
overall
i
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
the
craftsmanship
is
outstanding
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
o
everyone
in
my
family
likes
this
beer
and
no
one
else
in
my
family
likes
beer
it
may
be
the
perfect
stout
for
me
o
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
is
very
nice
the
taste
on
the
beginning
is
a
little
lackluster
but
not
underwhelming
in
the
least
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
more
than
make
up
for
it
and
provide
a
good
stout
i
would
recommend
trying
i
was
expecting
a
much
drier
stout
mainly
due
to
my
lack
of
experience
with
anything
but
irish
stouts
this
is
a
little
sweet
for
a
session
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
the
standard
for
oatmeal
stouts
very
drinkable
a
great
gateway
into
stouts
solid
this
beer
was
good
first
time
i
had
it
was
at
the
braveheart
highland
pub
in
hellertown
pa
the
beer
is
nice
rich
and
dark
the
aroma
and
taste
reflect
the
look
of
te
beer
this
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
metallic
flavor
at
first
which
faded
in
time
i
liked
the
strong
roasted
flavors
it
had
running
through
it
it
was
a
good
beer
for
sure
enjoyed
it
even
more
the
second
time
i
had
it
drinkability
and
overall
impression
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
each
sip
was
enjoyable
and
left
me
wanting
another
ill
have
this
beer
again
in
the
future
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
well
made
beer
that
deserves
the
high
regard
in
which
many
people
hold
it
it
is
well
balanced
and
worth
drinking
the
coffee
scent
hits
you
when
you
open
the
bottle
like
opening
a
bag
of
coffee
beans
color
is
completely
opaque
with
a
modest
tan
head
the
initial
flavor
is
a
subtle
maltiness
but
picks
up
to
a
bittersweetness
toward
the
finish
coffee
is
prominent
with
an
earthy
undertone
very
enjoyable
stout
this
is
a
very
example
and
a
go
to
beer
easy
to
drink
im
aging
a
couple
let
you
know
in
a
year
o
a
really
good
stout
light
enough
to
be
easy
drinking
flavourful
and
rich
enough
to
merit
attention
i
approve
of
the
larger
bottle
size
i
enjoyed
every
drop
definitely
recommended
d
i
think
its
better
on
tap
velvet
merlin
has
surpassed
it
in
my
opinion
i
used
to
love
this
beer
years
ago
but
my
palate
has
grown
give
it
a
shot
but
try
it
on
tap
if
you
can
drink
up
pours
black
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
that
disappears
fast
scent
is
a
bit
grainy
with
faint
hints
of
oat
and
chocolate
taste
is
like
guinness
but
a
whole
lot
better
there
are
some
flavors
of
chocolate
grain
oatmeal
and
light
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
still
pretty
light
and
although
not
nearly
as
watery
as
guinness
it
isnt
as
great
as
velvet
merlin
of
anderson
valley
oatmeal
stouts
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
is
tasty
and
low
abv
d
this
tastes
great
and
is
light
enough
to
have
3
or
4
o
very
enjoyable
can
sip
or
have
a
few
good
beer
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
and
am
glad
that
i
could
probably
only
stomach
2
per
sitting
4
a
500ml
a
bit
pricey
to
get
on
a
regular
basis
but
will
give
it
another
go
when
im
in
the
mood
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
love
it
and
its
great
that
it
doesnt
need
to
have
a
high
abv
to
be
good
very
enjoyable
stout
very
good
stout
one
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
full
and
very
smooth
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
but
works
out
very
well
a
very
enjoyable
beer
drinking
experience
i
could
settle
down
for
an
evening
with
several
of
these
on
hand
a
highquality
highlydrinkable
highlydelicious
oatmeal
stout
i
dont
have
to
think
a
lot
about
its
simple
and
does
that
simplicity
extremely
well
this
is
a
dailydrinking
stout
if
there
ever
was
one
this
stout
pours
a
classic
nearblack
with
no
light
coming
through
even
on
the
edges
small
tan
head
forms
with
a
hard
pour
smells
super
roasty
with
a
few
sweet
caramel
notes
palate
features
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
oats
and
caramel
quite
tasty
and
works
so
well
full
bodied
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
this
easy
drinking
stout
is
great
from
start
to
finish
benchmark
for
the
style
d
meh
there
wasnt
anything
special
the
sweetness
was
a
little
odd
and
it
was
quite
watery
for
a
stout
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
satisfiying
with
a
full
flavor
that
which
is
grand
and
memorable
drarely
can
i
get
a
stout
with
so
much
flavor
and
not
so
much
alcohol
it
a
really
nice
treat
and
this
one
disappeared
quite
quickly
an
all
around
solid
brew
funny
and
somewhat
sad
that
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
discover
this
gem
drinks
so
very
well
all
the
way
through
i
will
need
to
have
this
on
a
more
regular
basis
in
the
future
these
bottles
are
pretty
big
looks
like
18oz
the
one
gave
me
a
little
buzz
but
i
could
see
fitting
in
3
or
4
of
these
in
an
evening
d
superbly
drinkable
very
very
tasty
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
i
think
in
fact
that
i
will
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
fluffy
tan
head
on
it
smells
like
grain
and
alcohol
not
really
a
pleasant
aroma
tastes
like
some
coffee
molasses
maybe
some
caramel
medium
body
a
little
thickness
to
it
the
flavor
in
this
beer
isnt
really
my
cup
of
tea
its
pretty
drinkable
just
not
for
me
drinkability
a
little
too
flavorful
to
be
a
session
but
easy
enough
to
finish
a
full
bottle
without
feeling
overloaded
notes
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
if
you
have
not
tried
this
go
and
find
out
where
to
get
one
its
worth
it
samuel
smith
stouts
have
always
been
great
and
this
beer
is
nothing
less
than
excellent
it
is
pleasurable
in
the
mouth
and
does
not
leave
a
bad
aftertaste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
every
sip
it
is
affordable
and
delicious
even
to
someone
who
does
not
enjoy
stouts
too
much
it
does
start
with
a
slight
smell
of
soy
sauce
but
that
is
quickly
gone
with
the
first
taste
came
a
sweet
rich
stout
with
a
smooth
chocolately
finish
it
is
quite
smooth
for
a
stout
but
not
for
anyone
who
enjoys
a
light
seethrough
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
d
very
drinkable
very
nice
thick
for
a
5
abv
but
nonetheless
a
nightcap
for
many
i
suppose
after
a
while
it
gets
a
bit
sweet
but
overall
a
solid
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
mocha
colored
head
easy
3
finger
collar
of
foam
which
hung
around
initial
taste
was
that
of
cocoa
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
a
nice
sweetness
i
love
the
description
from
the
brewery
that
this
beer
was
originally
marketed
to
nursing
mothers
because
my
grandmother
in
law
still
swears
that
beer
is
what
helped
her
babies
sleep
through
the
night
when
she
was
nursing
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
and
will
definitely
buy
it
again
d
overall
a
very
tasty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
quite
enjoyed
the
leafy
hops
and
dark
cocoa
this
was
the
first
oatmeal
stout
that
had
oatmeal
flavours
that
lingered
on
the
tongue
highly
recommended
to
any
oatmeal
stout
fan
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
very
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
it
goes
down
easily
but
i
have
to
wait
a
bit
before
going
back
for
more
because
of
all
the
sweetness
recommended
a
vigorous
pour
produced
a
very
dark
brew
some
mahogany
edges
and
a
giant
fluffy
head
smell
is
not
strong
some
roasted
malts
maybe
some
vanilla
sweetness
expected
more
taste
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
smell
first
thing
i
notice
is
that
it
is
not
a
heavy
stout
but
a
rather
thin
one
molasses
taste
is
up
front
roasted
malts
are
present
not
overly
bitter
some
acidity
may
linger
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
matter
of
fact
i
had
to
force
myself
to
slow
down
but
at
5
no
matter
overall
a
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
solid
drink
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
solid
and
this
is
a
real
inexpensive
beer
sam
smith
for
the
win
again
great
stout
i
recommend
pours
black
with
nice
frothy
light
brown
top
froth
fizzles
away
to
an
18
consistent
head
in
a
tall
thin
glazs
dont
smell
much
but
some
dark
roasts
and
oatmeal
tastes
crisp
and
clean
nice
finish
oatmeal
and
roasted
barley
hangz
in
da
mouf
sweet
balanced
and
tasty
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
not
a
whole
lot
of
bubbles
very
tazty
woulx
have
no
trouble
drinking
anothee
one
od
these
this
being
my
first
review
i
must
admit
that
i
am
still
developing
my
palate
but
can
definitely
recognize
a
great
beer
when
i
drink
one
the
appearance
was
dark
and
tasty
looking
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
was
of
dark
malt
chocolate
the
taste
was
amazing
with
subtle
oatmeal
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
nice
hop
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
very
impressive
for
a
bottle
smooth
body
and
not
over
powering
drinkability
1
to
2
everyday
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
i
would
be
a
happy
man
great
beer
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
full
of
complex
flavor
though
sometimes
i
thought
it
was
a
little
light
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
a
stout
overall
a
great
boldly
robust
stout
and
still
one
of
my
favorite
brews
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
good
flavor
and
mouth
appeal
everything
is
great
to
me
about
this
beer
except
when
i
swallow
i
just
get
tired
of
that
flavor
it
leaves
behind
unfortunately
could
not
finish
this
one
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
though
i
doubt
that
i
will
purchase
it
again
i
just
wasnt
overly
fond
of
the
mineral
earth
tones
mixed
with
the
malt
notes
id
have
to
say
this
beer
is
drinkable
more
than
anything
else
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
but
it
is
fairly
tasty
and
would
totally
be
sessionable
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
and
was
hoping
to
be
blown
away
im
a
big
fan
of
their
imperial
stout
and
brown
ale
sadly
im
only
left
thinking
it
was
all
right
id
drink
it
again
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
550ml
bottle
pours
a
very
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
frothy
tan
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
with
some
caramel
and
vanilla
taste
is
a
blend
of
chocolate
vanilla
caramel
and
coffee
flavors
not
nearly
as
earthy
as
the
smell
would
indicate
slight
tangy
flavor
rather
heavy
mouthfeel
basically
the
benchmark
by
which
other
oatmeal
stouts
are
measured
this
is
a
great
beer
at
a
fair
price
this
beer
poured
a
dark
raisin
brown
with
a
one
finger
creamy
beige
head
when
picking
up
the
aromas
the
first
thing
i
think
of
is
newcastle
its
very
very
malty
and
there
are
slight
dark
fruits
namely
raisin
the
flavors
are
very
malty
and
sweeter
than
expected
theres
light
chocolate
light
dark
fruits
and
light
roasted
malty
sweetness
the
flavors
are
just
meh
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
though
this
beer
is
exceptionally
smooth
it
drinks
well
but
for
an
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
quite
a
few
thatre
better
than
this
the
flavor
just
throws
me
off
a
bit
its
still
solid
just
not
worthy
of
the
rating
in
my
opinion
almost
black
in
color
with
a
nicely
contrasted
thick
foamy
beige
head
completely
opaque
nose
of
sweet
malt
and
coffee
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
with
less
chewiness
than
others
but
made
up
for
with
added
flavor
complexity
malt
swirls
with
coffee
and
bread
grains
for
a
hearty
taste
even
if
a
bit
liquidy
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
but
crisp
theres
definitely
a
place
for
this
one
in
the
world
of
stouts
overall
this
was
quite
the
treat
i
am
a
fan
of
outmeal
stout
and
this
is
one
that
i
would
certainly
recommend
drinkability
certainly
solid
enough
a
great
set
of
scents
and
pretty
decent
flavors
to
follow
body
isnt
as
thick
and
smooth
as
i
would
like
but
it
also
doesnt
come
across
heavy
at
all
and
with
the
moderate
abv
of
5
i
would
say
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
get
through
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
with
little
to
no
problem
pours
black
with
a
hint
of
a
deep
red
hue
threefinger
brown
head
which
does
a
nice
job
lasting
and
sticking
to
the
glass
milk
chocolate
aroma
nice
sweet
smell
very
enjoyable
flavor
milk
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
to
start
roasted
oats
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
along
with
more
chocolate
round
out
the
beer
which
finishes
with
a
lingering
roasted
coffee
flavor
long
into
the
aftertaste
very
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
m
d
very
drinkable
no
bitterness
sweet
low
carbonation
d
this
beer
is
very
similar
in
all
respects
to
their
imperial
stout
but
i
think
it
is
more
drinkable
because
the
sourness
seems
to
have
been
cut
by
the
dryness
of
this
beer
overall
its
a
more
enjoyable
brew
that
goes
down
easier
for
me
the
lower
alcohol
content
also
helps
the
drinkablility
do
this
may
be
the
most
drinkable
widely
available
oatmeal
stout
very
smooth
id
say
this
is
a
classic
beer
for
the
style
d
very
easy
to
drink
these
but
would
prefer
a
more
roasty
stout
drink
this
beer
had
terrific
balance
and
was
extremely
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
nice
beer
balance
makes
it
easy
to
drink
inherent
sweetness
of
the
style
limits
session
ability
certainly
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
this
beer
you
need
to
try
it
and
if
you
havent
had
one
in
a
while
stop
and
have
one
this
beerpours
a
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
smells
malty
strong
a
real
nice
rich
creamy
taste
finishs
very
nice
doesnt
have
the
water
taste
like
some
stouts
easy
to
drink
but
still
a
full
flavor
overall
a
great
oatmeal
stout
a
must
try
dthis
very
quickly
became
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
incredibly
drinkable
with
fantastic
flavor
and
an
average
abv

could
easily
drink
this

and
the
signature
sammy
rusty
water
aroma
i
get
from
all
their
beers

matches
aroma
with
the
oatmeal

chocolate
standing
out
with

little
cocoa
powder
for
good
measure
palate
is
creamy
then
dry
and
ashy
a
classic
and
tasty

delicious

always
a
good
idea
to
try
an
old
master

has
been
around
awhile
overall
an
awesome
oatmeal
stout
that
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
or
stouts
in
general
you
cant
go
without
having
this
one
drinkability
damn
good
stuff
it
is
certainly
worthy
of
celebration
a
superb
rich
brew
with
all
the
drinkabilty
of
a
lighter
beer
sizable
head
leaves
lots
of
lace
after
a
slow
fade
could
be
brown
but
looks
black
to
me
aromas
of
toffee
and
roasted
malts
some
butterscotch
and
an
earthy
scent
light
hop
florals
taste
follows
nose
with
a
lovely
dry
finish
that
showcases
the
blend
of
malted
barley
and
oats
a
bit
of
chocolate
blended
in
feel
is
silky
smooth
and
light
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
light
and
delightful
super
drinkable
and
just
short
of
perfect
d
delicious
beer
and
a
stout
i
will
definately
return
to
good
transition
beer
for
guinness
fans
poured
into
a
sam

pint
a
nice
deep
brownblack
with
a
fat
head
from
a
moderatly
heavy
pour
the
lace
is
sparse
but
sticky
oats
and
chocolate
dominate
the
taste
some
vanilla
follows
with
some
mild
but
noticable
earthy
hops
for
bitterness
not
all
balanced
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
doesnt
bum
me
out

and
thick

yeah
samuel
smith
two
thumbs
up
a
goddamn
classic
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
one
that
id
love
to
have
over
and
over
again
overall
this
is
so
far
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
tried
it
embodies
the
style
so
wonderfully
great
beer
and
a
fore
sure
buy
again
off
to
get
one
now
before
the
stores
close
great
beer
samuel
smith
old
brewery
d
a
delicious
brew
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
d
i
could
easily
go
through
any
number
of
these
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
great
beer
and
i
would
not
change
a
thing
about
it
d
good
drinkabilty
due
to
the
incredible
smoothness
however
this
seemed
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
many
more
pints
even
if
i
wanted
to
highly
drinkable
stout
i
buy
this
at
bevmo
for
3
bucks
its
a
pint
bottle
love
everything
about
the
appearance
including
the
bottle
and
label
thick
dark
head
a
better
guinness
alcohol
is
rough
on
my
body
and
drinking
something
of
this
quality
keeps
the
creepy
crawly
awful
hangovers
from
happenin
you
aint
gonna
get
drunk
too
quick
and
its
something
that
your
body
can
process
better
than
some
hypercarbonated
mass
produced
high
fructose
ht
this
is
the
goto
dark
beer
my
nubian
bruthaz
o
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
the
roasty
bitterness
is
perfectly
matched
with
moderate
sweetness
d
high
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
full
body
beer
that
is
very
filling
so
have
to
drink
it
slowly
and
enjoy
it
this
is
a
must
try
oatmeal
stout
d
extremely
drinkable
quite
enjoyable
d
not
a
bad
quaff
however
this
bottle
is
more
than
likely
my
last
purchase
of
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
d
very
drinkable
will
drink
again
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
yet
pours
a
great
black
with
only
the
slightest
of
light
highlighted
brown
body
is
thin
not
to
thick
wich
i
feel
compliments
this
brew
greatly
aroma
is
of
a
roasty
oatsmalt
with
the
slight
hint
of
a
dark
chocolate
background
these
two
aromas
compliment
each
other
greatly
with
providing
the
desired
smelltaste
up
front
with
the
undertone
armoataste
heping
to
stand
these
main
charectors
threw
the
carbonation
is
good
if
only
sometimes
a
slight
over
drinkability
is
great
due
to
the
body
and
alcholo
level
would
recomend
this
brew
to
someone
looking
to
step
foot
in
to
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
at
a
low
abv
i
do
prefer
stouts
to
have
a
little
more
bitterness
however
this
is
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
i
still
would
not
call
myself
a
stout
guy
but
this
definitely
improves
my
opinion
of
the
style
much
more
drinkable
than
guiness
i
am
not
left
w
the
cottonmouth
burn
toast
aftertaste
that
i
get
from
it
d
i
may
be
used
to
the
aforementioned
imperial
styles
of
stout
so
this
seems
very
drinkable
even
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
taste
i
keep
going
back
to
this
one
for
sip
after
sip
overall
samuel
smiths
own
a
special
place
in
my
heart
when
i
started
drinking
craft
their
beers
were
some
of
the
first
i
gravitated
towards
its
just
fitting
that
this
classic
is
my
100th
review
completely
by
accident
not
by
choice
drinkability
definitely
a
different
tasting
beer
complex
sweet
and
surprisingly
low
in
abv
unlike
most
unique
beers
brewed
today
a
little
pricey
in
my
opinion
but
it
does
have
a
nice
presentation
which
makes
me
feel
somewhat
stately
just
for
buying
it
drinkability
an
old
favorite
that
often
gets
overlooked
by
me
for
other
beers
every
time
i
go
back
to
it
i
ask
myself
why
do
i
not
drink
more
of
this
a
very
smooth
and
flavorful
stout
at
5
that
i
can
drink
over
and
over
again
time
to
put
this
back
into
the
regular
rotation
again

just
a

that
also
comes

this
stout
is
a
slightly

a
winner
kept
me
feverishly
wanting

after

that
i
was

my
desire
to
savor

and
perhaps
the
old
brewerys
best
offering
d
this
is
a
very
easily
consumed
stout
it
isnt
heavy
like
big
stouts
can
be
yet
is
very
flavorful
and
balanced
this
is
not
a
fancy
oatmeal
stout

it
is
a
damn
good
one

just
a

well
as

the

this
is
pretty
nice
a
winning
easy
drinker
pretty
mellow
but
still
complex
there
is
a
bready
sweetness
that
sticks
out
and
gives
it
an
almost
candytinged
character
i
am
on
the
fence
as
to
whether
this
is
a
positive
or
negative
like
their
imperial
this
samuel
smith
leans
a
tad
sweet
for
my
liking
though
not
to
the
point
of
ruining
anything
and
like
their
taddy
porter
there
is
a
slight
weird
pungency
in
the
background
which
im
not
sure
how
to
feel
about
exactly
still
theres
no
question
this
is
a
quality
brew
that
makes
for
some
good
pleasant
sipping
of
the
oatmeal
stouts
ive
tried
this
remains
one
of
the
best
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
and
one
of
the
best
session
stouts
on
the
market
nothing
here
will
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
is
not
designed
to
i
have
had
a
couple
bottles
in
the
past
with
a
metallic
flavor
which
were
drainpours
but
im
sure
they
were
handled
poorly
far
more
often
then
not
they
survive
the
trip
to
america
perfectly
fine
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
dinner
ok
maybe
that
last
one
is
stretching
it
too
far
notes
my
new
favorite
stout
picked
up
a

pack

set
for

came
with
a
nice
gold
stamped

2
coasters

worth

price
compared
to
the
same
stores
price
of

59
for
singles
wegmansi
will
be
getting
many
more
d
nice
drinkable
beer
something
to
have
with
a
meal
and
then
have
another
aftewards
to
enjoy
the
post
meal
coma
with
d
i
could
put
these
down
one
after
another
very
easy
drinking
excellent
value
would
recommond
to
someone
as
a
replacement
for
guinness
taste
opens
with
a
distinct
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
taste
leaves
a
fine
and
long
lasting
toffee
aftertaste
oatmeal
taste
becomes
much
more
prominent
towards
the
end
finishes
nicely
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
overall
the
absolute
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
it
is
silky
smooth
and
curiously
curbs
some
of
the
admittedly
robust
flavors
into
easier
drinking
components
this
brew
exhibits
the
full
gamut
of
aromas
and
flavors
and
then
some
expected
of
a
stout
helping
propel
it
as
an
exceptional
beer
do
not
miss
this
one
great
on
a
cool
winter
night
d
if
i
were
at
a
bar
with
this
on
tap
id
probably
have
quite
the
headache
the
next
morning
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
d
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
d
rerally
great
beer
and
very
very
drinkable
this
is
my
personal
favorite
oatmeal
stout
and
i
think
the
best
interpretation
ofthe
style
good
well
rounded
oatmeal
stout
with
an
incredible
aroma
to
boot
highly
recommended
drink
ability
is
quite

i
remembered
loving
this
when
it
came
available
last
year
around
the
holidays
and
i
wasnt
let
down
this
time
around
id
recommend
this
to
introduce
newbies
to
the
style
it
packs
a
whole
lot
of
flavour
is
complex
and
is
also
wellbalanced
so
it
is
likely
to
appeal
to
many
drinkability
surprisingly
easy

i
have
ever
rated

of
chocolate
coffee
molasses
and
some
earthly
smells
of
damp
places
where
mushrooms
and
moss
grow
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
deep
roasted
coffee
very
dark
molasses
clover
sweet
malts
and
roasted
oats
good
creamy
feeling
in
my
mouth
with
just
a
little
attention
getting
zing
maybe
a
little
heavy
for
drinking
all
the
time
this
beer
does
offer
great
flavor
and
body
and
a
great
beer
for
special
occasions
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
makes
this
stout
very
enjoyable
to

pretty

the
king
of

just
about
everything
ive
had
is
tops
for
the
country
this
is
exceptionally
tasty
given
how
small
of
a
beer
it
is
and
allows
you
to
drink
plenty
of
it

is

down

will
get

off

this

i

you
will
find
any

wow
thats
about
all
i
can
say
truly
an
extraordinary
stout
i
really
dont
see
how
sam
smiths
makes
such
well
rounded
beers
the
only
reason
i
didnt
score
this
as
a
perfect
brew
is
because
if
i
find
a
stout
that
is
better
i
want
to
leave
myself
some
wiggle
room
other
than
that
its
the
best
stout
i
have
had
thus
far
on
my
short
journey
d
super
drinkable
just
a
really
enjoyable
beer
the
mouthfeel
and
just
smoothness
are
something
special
as
i
stated
a
few
times
above
this
brew
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
its
a
great
creamy
beer
that
is
just
smooth
and
comes
together
and
has
a
nice
finish
the
look
on
this
brew
is
a
bit
scary
at
first
but
the
drink
is
actually
pretty
easy
and
i
certianly
could
do
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
with
the
lower
abv
and
the
fact
that
its
that

if

side
of

then
this
has

be
in

bank
of
beers
md
had
a
lighter
body
than
i
would
have
imagined
for
a
stout
but
it
was
still
well
carbonated
so
that
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
finishes
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
since
theres
not
much
trace
of
hops
and
very
clean
after
you
swallow
extremely

very
complex

quite

sorta

up

it

i
have
had
this
beer
before
about
2
years
ago
and
didnt
like
it
well
this
is
a
testament
to
my
palette
growing
over
time
this
is
mighty
tasty
you
should
be
able
to
pick
this
beer
up
at
your
local
store
and
i
highly
recommend
it
great
beer
it
is
clean
crisp
and
very
flavorful
d
extremely
drinkable
ive
been
overlooking
beers
like
these
since
i
got
seriously
into
craft
in
late
2008
its
nice
to
revisit
them
on
a
trained
palate
and
reevaluate
them
this
this
is
great
i
need
to
buy
more
of
this
and
stop
wasting
money
on
somewhat
dicey
10
bombers
i
poured
this
almost
opaque
black
beer
into
my
glass
and
noticed
a
nice
tan
head
that
stuck
to
the
glass
throughout
my
entire
drinking
experience
yum
it
smelled
slightly
sweet
and
chocolaty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
it
was
very
smooth
sweet
and
bold
its
oatmeal
label
made
the
oattaste
stand
out
in
my
mind
but
the
flavor
was
filled
mostly
with
coffee
chocolate
and
perhaps
some
kind
of
herb
like
rosemary
perhaps
there
wasnt
much
carbonation
and
had
a
nice
malty
finish
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
one
is
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
have
minded
another
bottle
drinkability
this
is
good
but
i
think
i
must
have
it
with
a
meal
this
isnt
a
beer
for
me
anyway
for
just
drinking
by
itself
but
it
does
go
well
with
a
meal
burger
and
fries
in
this
case
picked
up
a
sam
smith
sampler
pack
to
get
another
one
of
their
great
pint
glasses
and
do
some
reviews
the
oatmeal
stout
started
out
pretty
good
but
had
a
little
metallic
taste
to
it
worth
a
try
though
overall
samuel
smith
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
glassand
this
is
the
third
sampler
i
ve
got
thanks
jer
so
ive
got
some
extrasand
revisiting
this
classic
is
a
pleasant
reminder
of
how
nice
drinking
a
beer
can
be
tasty
classy
relaxing
and
reinvigorating
a
new
years
eve
drag
simultaneously
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
could
drink
this
all
day
if
i
pace
myself
especially
so
in
the
cold
michigan
winter
months
also
this
beer
pairs
especially
well
with
drier
cheeses
like
sharp
cheddar
and
provolone
i
simply
love
this
beer
and
just
drove
to
three
separate
liquor
stores
to
find
it
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
remains
on
the
glass
the
taste
starts
with
a
roasted
flavor
and
finishes
smooth
with
some
caramel
notes
i
dont
find
this
beer
overly
sweet
at
all
it
isnt
hoppy
but
instead
is
well
balanced
like
any
english
ale
should
be
i
just
drove
twenty
miles
to
find
this
beer
and
it
is
so
smooth
and
well
worth
it
no
american
beer
can
match
it
in
a
class
by
itself
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
d
refreshing
and
delicious
with
a
lower
abv
great
stout
notes
balance
subtlety
and
multidimensional
grains
make
this
a
winner
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
taddy
porter
the
low
abv
makes
it
an
ideal
sipping
drink
too
if
only
i
could
continually
afford
this
m
d
nice
smooth
very
comfortable
to
drink

without
being

filling

that
ill

could

this
one
all

d
exceptional
on
this
beer
the
flavor
is
so
well
put
together
it
is
complex
but
not
overwhelming
the
oats
do
an
amazing
job
or
rounding
everything
out
this
beer
rolls
over
your
tongue
incredibly
gracefully
and
the
finish
leaves
you
dying
for
another
sip
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
nice
rich
flavorful
stout
it
has
an
amazing
texture
that
i
really
look
forward
to
in
an
oatmeal
stout
delicious
beer
would
go
great
with
a
range
of
food
roasted
meats
bbq
smoked
fare
chocolate
desserts
truffles
ice
creams
well
rounded

of

notes
well
im
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
it
was
the
first
sam
smith
beer
i
had
and
the
first
oatmeal
stout
i
had
it
remains
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
and
is
one
of
the
standouts
in
samuel
smiths
excellent
arsenal
of
beers
this
is
considered
the
quintessential
oatmeal
stout
and
for
good
reason
d
i
really
enjoy
this
stout
its
very
drinkable
and
in
many
ways
nearly
perfect
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
i
believe
it
would
be
perfect
a
great
stout
needless
to
say
i
find
however
that
one
of
these
is
plenty
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
so
it
gets
a
4
on
drinkability
likewise
there
could
be
more
heft
and
more
creaminess
to
the
beer
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
that
is
available
at
a
mass
scale
easy
drinking
smooth
roasty
flavor
everything
this
style
stands
for

almost

in
complexion
with
some
ruby
highlights
around
the
base
of
the
glass
head
is
dense
and
frothy
almost
nitrouslike
and
tan
in
color
as
the
head
sizzles
and
pops
and
slowly
collapses
it
exposes
a
pockmarked
surface
and
thin
sticky
webs

as
it
settles
into
a
solid
half
inch
cap
malty

with
the
suggestion
of
coca
brown
sugar

flaked
oats
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
i
get
a
little
milky
sweetness
in
the
mix
perhaps
some
lactic
acid
and
a
slightly
metallic
quality
that
comes
out
at
the
back
body
is
lightmedium
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
a
little
watery
but
goes
down
very
smooth
as
the
carbonation
is
very
even
and
subtle
i
tend
to
like
a
little
more
mouthfeel
in
my
oatmeal
stouts
however
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
sessionable
brew
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
this
brewer
overall
it
is
an
interesting
brew
which
i
encourage
anyone
who
likes
stouts
to
try
this
atleast
once
i
am
sure
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
gateway
beer
for
someone
that
is
looking
into
getting
into
craft
beer
d
this
one
feels
like
youre
drinking
a
beer
goes
great
with
any
occasion
if
you
havent
tried
one
pick
it
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
is
my
first
non
ris
i
was
expecting
something
weak
and
undrikable
but
this
really
hits
the
spot
a
fine
beer
indeed
drinkability
an
extraordinary
drink
this
beer
is
a
staple
for
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
at
5
alcohol
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
a
classic
among
beer
aficionados
when
i
woke
the
next
morning
i
could
still
taste
this
beer
and
was
very
tempted
to
have
a
pint
for
breakfast
ahh
a
classic
poureds
traight
down
the
middle
into
a
tulip
glass
and
got
a
nice
creamy
3
finger
head
with
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
a
very
enticing
sweet
malty
smell
that
invites
you
to
take
a
sip
the
malts
are
the
star
of
this
show
and
they
shine
tremendously
nice
sweet
malty
taste
but
not
too
sweet
a
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
of
a
meduim
bodied
beer
just
enough
to
coat
your
palate
and
not
overtake
it
great
beer
for
sitting
by
the
fire
with
a
newspaper
or
crossword
puzzle
so
drinkable
session
this
after
you
session
half
of
the
lineup
from
this
brewery
amazing
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
world
md
a
surprisingly
light
body
that
has
an
irony
watery
feel
some
modest
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
even
sessionable
at
5
abv
d
a
very
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
was
fantastic
flavorful
strong
bodied
and
tasty
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
did
a
beer
tasting
at
my
work
for
this
beer
wines
unlimited
stratford
ct
and
it
went
very
well
too
people
bought
this
beer
that
night
by
the
couples
or
fews
which
considering
its
steep
price
and
it
mysterious
nature
this
beer
did
well
i
liked
this
beer
jolly
good
edit
what
a
sweet
mess
down
the
drain
it
goes
stones
ipa
is
going
to
clear
my
palate
well
i
got
this
as
a
recommendation
from
the
great
bear
guide
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
have
had
a
much
better
oatmeal
stout
founders
outmeal
stout
is
by
far
the
best
of
this
type
i
have
had
and
one
of
the
best
of
all
beers
but
samuel
smiths
version
is
pretty
good
but
i
would
say
founders
is
much
better
a
lovely
lovely
sipper
quaffer
drinker
whatever
this
goes
down
oh
so
very
well
the
oatmeal
softening
and
at
times
leading
the
way
not
hard
to
see
why
this
is
considered
to
be
among
the
progenitors
of
the
style
overall
tonight
i
bought
two
imperial
stouts
by
samuel
smith
and
one
oatmeal
i
wish
it
was
the
other
way
around
if
youre
a
stout
fan
i
highly
recommend
you
to
try
this
overall
this
was
another
exceptional
release
from
samuel
smith
that
portrayed
all
of
the
qualities
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
this
brewery
that
takes
great
care
in
crafting
their
beer
recommended
pours
a
black
color
with
dark
red
edges
and
a
creamy
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
molasses
and
licorice
taste
is
delicious
with
flavors
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
chocolate
dark
fruits
licorice
and
a
bit
of
coffee
really
nice
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
perfect
carbonation
an
extremely
drinkable
stout
this
is
a
classic
d
excellent
everything
seems
to
be
in
balance
making
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
f
still
a
little
somewhat
sweet
some
roasted
flavors
come
out
as
it
warms
the
milk
chocolate
lingers
with
a
very
slight
bitterness

d
this
is
very
drinkable
rich
and
full
but
not
too
alcoholic
or
overpowering
a
solid
stout
but
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
imo
but
i
can
chug
this
stuff
down
very
drinkable
its
a
rather
mild
beer
and
simple
i
feel
the
score
could
be
higher
but
the
lack
of
complexity
hurts
this
is
a
great
brew
with
tons
of
flavor
and
character
and
at
a
lower
abv
can
be
enjoyed
all
evening
very
good
overall
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
its
not
blowing
me
out
of
the
water
with
its
flavors
but
it
is
very
complex
and
mellow
and
definitely
worth
a
try
for
a
darker
brew
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
incredibly
enjoyable
d
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
one
any
stout
fan
has
to
try
it
sets
the
bar
high
for
this
particular
beer
style
the
low
abv
also
helps
make
it
a
meal
in
the
bottle
that
you
can
enjoy
one
bottle
after
the
next
beer
poured
out
very
dark
with
nice
foamy
head
i
had
heard
this
was
an
exceptional
beer
and
it
did
not
fail
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
my
limited
beer
drinking
experience
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
samuel
smith
brews
this
beer
is
a
must
for
all
bas
cheers
while
in
my
humble
opinion
this
isnt
in
the
top
level
of
stouts
i
did
enjoy
this
drop
and
definitely
one
id
have
again
just
a
perfect
looking
oatmeal
stout
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
head
looks
frothy
and
is
retaining
well
smell
is
of
very
roasty
malts
oatmeal
and
a
nice
fuggles
aroma
seems
like
the
perfect
nightcap
after
a
night
of
fantastic
beers
new
years
eve
easily
my
favorite
traditional
oatmeal
stout
huge
oat
flavor
along
with
the
roasted
barley
and
malts
nice
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
that
gives
the
beer
a
dryness
just
fantastically
well
rounded
gently
bittered
and
perfectly
roasty
not
thin
like
many
oatmeal
stouts
tend
to
be
perfectly
creamy
and
chewy
breakfast
in
a
glass
low
abv
so
this
one
is
superbly
drinkable
i
could
see
putting
a
few
of
these
back
while
fending
off
the
cold
such
a
good
beer
and
the
fact
that
its
widely
available
means
my
wallet
will
suffer
i
cannot
recommend
this
one
however
lots
of
people
love
this
beer
so
i
guess
youll
have
to
try
it
for
ourself
and
make
up
your
own
mind
part
of
a
gift
pack
poured
into
pint
glass
provided
very
dark
brown
that
lets
just
a
tiny
hint
of
light
shinning
through
nice
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
slowly
disperses
into
a
film
only
minor
lacing
aroma
very
neutral
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
very
smooth
to
drink
feels
great
in
the
mouth
very
dry
in
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
bitterness
a
very
chuggable
stout
and
one
that
you
can
drink
many
of
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
pour
gargantuan
creamy
head
or
subdued
1
finger
that
crest
the
glass
like
the
picture
on
the
box
let
the
head
die
down
so
you
can
view
the
magnificent
black
body
with
dark
brown
bubbles
sweet
vanilla
and
cinnamon
buns
in
the
nose
backed
up
by
a
roasty
sweet
malt
aroma
tastes
like
an
unbitter
roasty
milk
chocolate
oatmeal
beer
molasses
drizzled
coffee
beans
are
big
in
the
taste
followed
by
milk
chocolate
covered
roasted
sweet
oats
mouthfeel
is
creamy
silky
and
luxuriousheavy
as
well
as
drinkable
and
tasty
as
they
come
alcohol
hidden
even
for
a
5
abv
d
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
prob
one
of
my
all
time
fav
lower
abv
stouts
loaded
with
flavor
for
the
gravity
this
beer
is
great
over
the
years
i
have
had
it
many
many
times
and
it
never
fails
to
please
great
job
from
sammy
smith
d
delightful
great
by
itself
with
burgers

of
occasions
pours
a

medium
foamy
tan
head
lacing
throughout
aroma
of
sweet
malts
toffee
coffee
dark
caramel
chocolate
smooth
and
silky
on
the
tongue
very
nice
and
wellbalanced
sweet
yes
but
not
overwhelming
not
too
dry
either
very
nice
beer
but
i
agree
with
many
others
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
savoring
a
550
ml
bottle
is
very
nice
indeed
just
keeps
getting
better
throughout
the
bottle
and
is
quite
drinkable
due
to
its
non
massive
abv
if
you
want
power
alochol
check
out
sammy
smiths
imperial
stout
drinkability
definitely
buying
more
of
this
im
looking
foward
to
the
next
bottle
d
thanks
you
sir
can
i
have
aother
d
high
fantastic
im
not
the
biggest
stout
fan
but
even
i
cant
deny
this
beer
highly
recommended
this
was
one
of
my
first
favorites
back
in
college
in
the
80s
its
still
one
of
my
favorites
the
stout
from
tadcaster
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
frothy
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
lots
of
lacing
lines
the
glass
the
pour
is
quite
pretty
the
nose
is
quite
sweet
with
the
usual
stout
aromas
of
chocolate
and
coffee
but
this
also
contains
some
grainy
nuts
as
well
as
malts
taste
is
sweet
as
well
with
lots
of
chocolate
where
is
the
oatmeal
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crispy
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
but
well
balanced
that
provides
much
more
than
the
average
stout
the
first
sip
is
very
smooth
with
an
even
flavor
and
nice
carbonation
nothing
is
too
overpowering
id
say
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
feel
for
this
beer
after
enjoying
two
oatmeal
stout
singles
from
samuel
smith
i
not
only
am
going
to
try
another
brew
from
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
im
going
to
explore
more
in
the
world
of
stouts
medium
bodied
superbly
easy
to
drink
a
top
example
of
the
style
and
an
alltime
classic
beer
atmosphere
is
great
beautiful
appearance
and
a
great
complex
wellbalanced
nose
flavor
is
a
nearperfect
balance
of
hearty
malt
sweetness
and
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
would
buy
again
and
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
d
an
excellent
stout
though
a
bit
heavy
and
taking
a
while
to
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
wouldnt
mind
more
the
first
thing
i
tasted
with
this
beer
is
a
medium
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
then
taken
over
by
a
creamy
semisweet
roasted
coffeechocolate
flavor
its
almost
like
if
you
were
to
put
a
little
dark
chocolate
and
a
splash
of
milk
in
a
cup
of
coffee
although
most
oatmeal
stouts
tend
to
have
a
more
neutral
acidic
flavor
than
chocolate
or
coffee
stouts
this
beer
is
no
exception
the
acid
flavor
goes
up
and
then
comes
back
down
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
very
well
made
overall
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
i
could
drink
this
all
day
drinkability
could
easily
drink
a
few
in
a
night
before
it
got
too
heavy
for
me
truly
a
delicious
oatmeal
stout
and
will
continue
to
drink
it
again
and
again
overall
an
excellent
beer
by
far
the
best
of
the
3
pack
which
includes
their
eba
and
epad
easily
placed
in
the
top
ten
beers
ive
ever
had
st
ambroise
version
of
this
is
great
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
a
perfect
dessert
beer
but
i
could
see
myself
having
this
on
almost
any
occasion
i
think
this
will
be
one
of
my
favourites
for
a
long
time
d
average
mouthfeel
is
great
but
with
its
heavier
qualities
i
might
be
taking
a
breather
before
i
drink
any
in
a
session
one
was
like
a
liquid
dessert
appearance
is
almost
black
with
a
big
2
finger
off
white
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
so
is
the
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
as
its
going
down
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
perfect
almost
creamy
extremely
great
stouthighly
recommend
it
everything
i
have
tried
from
sam
smith
has
been
spot
on
they
usually
set
the
benchmark
for
most
english
styles
the
oatmeal
stout
is
no
exception
almost
black
in
colour
but
you
really
need
to
look
at
a
bit
to
notice
its
brown
tone
very
dark
almost
opaque
its
espresso
lookalike
body
is
crowned
by
cremalike
head
tightlyformed
with
a
rich
tan
colour
that
cap
of
foam
shows
excellent
retention
and
clings
thickly
to
the
walls
of
your
glass
deep
brown
sugar
aroma
underpins
notes
of
coffee
and
raisins
tastes
more
breakfast
roast
than
french
initial
coffee
flavour
gives
way
midpalate
to
fruit
and
semisweet
chocolate
finishes
with
a
medium
bitterness
throughout
there
is
an
underlying
gentle
sweetness
while
not
the
heaviest
stout
around
the
oats
do
give
it
some
noticeable
weight
on
the
palate
it
feels
much
heavier
in
the
mouth
than
it
does
in
the
stomach
very
smooth
and
velvety
with
very
little
carbonation
wellrounded
and
flavourful
and
a
pleasure
for
all
the
senses
outstanding
overall
its
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
great
overall
very
satisfying
definitely
worth
buying
again
final
thoughts
all
in
all
solid
stuff
here
nothing
really
to
complain
about
this
would
be
great
to
have
by
a
fireplace
at
the
cottage
or
at
christmas
im
not
sure
id
say
its
incredible
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
at
the
very
least
d
a
well
balanced
smooth
and
great
tasting
beer
this
along
with
the
5
abv
make
this
extremely
drinkable
you
gotta
love
how
smooth
this
is
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
after
the
first
taste
i
thought
it
would
be
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
about
halfway
through
however
there
was
an
off
flavor
of
sorts
which
could
only
be
compared
to
rotting
fruit
i
did
finish
it
but
i
was
tempted
to
pour
it
out
perhaps
the
fact
that
i
spent
3
99
on
it
kept
me
from
not
finishing
it
overall
a
very
disappointing
purchase
notes
i
rather
enjoyed
this
was
my
first
oatmeal
stout
will
be
buying
more
from
this
company
as
i
just
found
they
have
several
of
their
beers
at
my
local
fred
meyer
the
brew
pours
relatively
thin
with
a
huge
head
and
much
lacing
the
foam
is
a
light
tan
colour
and
the
body
is
dark
dark
brown
it
would
be
black
except
for
the
fact
that
light
can
get
through
it
even
the
center
of
the
beer
mostly
a
malty
smell
pretty
light
in
intensity
it
is
not
a
clean
nose
but
it
is
hardly
trying
to
make
a
big
impression
just
kind
of
a
malty
slightly
oatmealy
nose
the
taste
is
much
more
oatmeal
than
one
would
expect
in
the
nose
malts
decently
sized
and
are
complemented
by
an
almost
even
amount
of
oats
which
make
the
brew
taste
a
bit
sour
i
like
it
quite
a
lot
the
feel
is
a
most
a
lightmedium
but
there
is
a
very
crisp
carbonation
that
makes
things
a
bit
more
exciting
the
lightness
of
the
beer
but
the
intensity
and
darkness
of
the
taste
make
an
interesting
combination
that
i
find
quite
chugable
d
ya
its
drinkable
ive
never
had
more
than
two
oatmeal
stouts
in
one
sitting
so
i
dont
know
how
much
of
there
i
could
have
but
it
seems
pretty
drinkable
cheers
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
as
flavor
is
very
balanced
making
this
550ml
easy
to
enjoy
till
the
end
drinkability
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
this
550
ml
bottle
will
go
down
quickly
d
very
rich
but
i
could
drink
at
least
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
ive
never
had
an
oatmeal
stout
before
and
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
this
is
certainly
on
the
light
end
of
stouts
but
still
packs
a
complex
burst
of
flavor
brown
sugar
and
molasses
body
hints
of
wood
nuts
oatmeal
all
overlayed
on
a
light
roasty
malt
base
lightishmedium
body
but
at
5
no
surprise
there
almost
milk
stout
sweetness
would
gladly
sit
an
english
pub
and
quaff
this
most
of
the
evening
its
a
solid
beer
d
with
all
the
flavors
its
somewhere
between
a
candy
bar
and
a
sandwich
the
smoke
is
a
little
too
strong
but
its
overall
great
anyway
its
smooth
and
creamy
its
very
easygoing
and
its
wellrounded
with
no
flavor
presenting
itself
too
heavily
i
love
this
stout
overall
a
solid
choice
for
an
oatmeal
stout
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
it
provided
less
of
a
bold
roasted
malt
character
that
i
love
so
much
about
stouts
nonetheless
it
boasts
a
complex
flavor
solid
appearance
and
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
i
would
suggest
trying
it
if
you
have
not
already
poured
an
extremely
black
body
with
a
thick
khaki
colored
head
aroma
was
roasted
malts
and
i
detected
wet
cardboard
too
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
smooth
the
flavor
is
very
different
it
reminds
me
of
soil
the
smell
translated
to
taste
of
course
i
may
be
a
beer
nerd
but
no
one
has
ever
made
me
eat
dirt
this
cardboard
aroma
and
soil
flavor
lead
me
to
believe
this
bottle
is
old
or
infected
im
not
really
sure
too
bad
because
i
really
like
oatmeal
stout
and
want
to
like
this
one
but
it
wasnt
good
very
drinkable
overall
opinion
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
drink
regularly
i
enjoy
stouts
and
dark
malty
beers
so
this
was
a
real
treat
and
the
price
is
spot
on
considering
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
think
its
a
steal
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
person
that
loves
stouts
or
even
a
person
just
getting
into
them
its
a
great
beginner
stout
since
it
doesnt
really
attack
the
palate
like
some
stronger
stouts
might
drank
from
a
stifly
poured
bottle
and
gave
a
nice
head
that
was
inviting
not
overly
malty
with
a
nice
slight
bitterness
the
taste
didnt
stick
to
the
palate
as
it
was
drunk
overall
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
although
i
am
not
sprinting
to
the
beer
store
for
another
bottle
overall
a
true
classic
im
glad
to
have
on
hand
all
the
time
d
really
easy
to
drink
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
full
flavored
but
light
qualities
of
this
beer
really
contribute
to
this
definitely
a
gateway
beer
for
me
and
one
im
glad
i
revisited
overall
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
not
a
stout
brewed
with
oatmeal
worth
a
shot
d
very
easy
to
drink
however
it
isnt
like
there
is
a
high
abv
to
mask
or
anything
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thick
brown
head
fading
to
sheets
of
lacing
smells
of
tobacco
chocolate
roasted
coffee
taste
of
burnt
bitter
coffee
for
a
moment
then
sweet
chocolatecoffee
with
a
mild
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
smooth
with
a
medium
body
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
the
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
was
one
of
the
first
stouts
i
ever
drank
and
along
with
their
imperial
stout
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
if
you
like
the
style
or
sweeter
full
flavored
beers
in
general
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
simply
put
my
new
favorite
stout
drinkability
this
is
my
first
oatmeal
stout
so
i
might
be
a
little
skewed
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
the
oats
really
add
a
new
depth
of
flavor
to
an
already
great
style
dark
rich
pour
with
a
finger
of
creamy
tan
foam
silky
and
velvety
texture
amazingly
smooth
i
could
surprisingly
make
this
a
session
beer
the
sweet
chocolate
flavor
is
not
overbearing
it
is
perfect
as
an
after
dinner
beer
or
for
drinking
a
few
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
dark
beer
it
smells
of
cocoa
nuts
and
maybe
a
hint
of
cinnamon
enjoy
one
of
you
get
the
chance
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
dark
rich
and
thick
with
a
solid
inch
of
head
the
smell
doesnt
offer
much
but
has
a
faint
sweet
aroma
hiding
in
the
background
taste
is
very
sweet
combining
semisweet
dark
chocolate
chips
raisins
and
the
namesake
oatmeal
this
features
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
and
awesome
drinkability
almost
no
alcohol
presence
whatsoever
this
is
a
very
solid
easydrinking
stout
a
great
sipping
stout
will
be
stocking
up
on
these
when
winter
comes
around
again
d
highly
drinkable
flavor
isnt
too
heavy
but
is
complex
enough
to
keep
me
intrigued
enjoyable
if
youre
looking
to
transition
from
a
maltier
palate
to
something
that
starts
to
be
hoppy
this
isnt
it
but
itll
wean
you
off
the
excessive
maltiness
possibly
the
best
oatmeal
stout
in
existence
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
50
degree
chilled
bottle
dark
as
night
with
a
tight
tan
head
and
lacing
the
smell
was
fantastic
and
was
better
to
me
than
the
taste
roasty
toasty
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
beverage
was
bone
dry
but
right
for
the
style
easily
drinkable
and
a
nice
brew
d
with
such
a
wonderful
flavor
and
texture
not
to
mention
a
pretty
nice
abv
this
beer
is
certainly
one
worth
enjoying
again
and
again
this
beer
gets
top
marks
for
drinkability
now
excuse
me
im
going
to
get
back
to
enjoying
this
wonderful
beer
my
problem
with
samuel
smiths
is
that
they
all
taste
okay
but
the
tastes
seem
pretty
similar
very
dry
and
alcoholheavy
this
is
fine
but
i
wish
each
brew
was
more
distinguishable
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
while
not
exactly
session
material
its
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
having
several
over
the
course
of
a
long
evening
d
good
seems
like
it
would
go
good
paired
with
a
roast
and
thick
stew
no
chance
of
this
beer
overpowering
your
meal
drinkability
excellent
drank
my
first
on
a
lazy
cold
and
dreary
sunday
afternoon
and
wanted
to
drink
sip
the
afternoon
away
very
good
beer
i
thought
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
stout
ive
saved
this
for
just
such
an
evening
the
first
truly
cool
falllike
night
to
hit
our
area
a
pint
of
this
is
an
absolutely
perfect
compliment
to
not
only
dinner
but
the
evening
let
this
beer
breathe
and
warm
up
a
bit
and
its
smoothness
and
complexity
will
be
revealed
outstanding
smell
and
taste
go
hand
in
hand
chocolate
hits
the
nose
easily
and
tastes
easilyof
coffee
and
chocolately
light
bodied
for
a
stout
light
but
noticeable
carbonation
all
in
all
a
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
brew
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
with
a
very
complex
body
that
changes
througout
the
process
d
very
filling
it
is
an
oatmeal
stout
after
all
not
too
bad
but
ive
had
better
see
barney
flatts
review
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
dark
tan
three
finger
head
medium
lacing
and
decent
retention
fits
the
style
smells
and
tastes
of
oatmeal
sweetness
roasted
malts
some
coffee
bitter
chocolate
and
some
hops
great
taste
the
smell
is
a
tiny
bit
weak
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
for
a
stout
no
alcohol
warming
and
a
good
coat
of
hoppy
oat
flavor
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
great
awesome
taste
good
price
would
buy
again
and
no
alcohol
or
bad
flavors
to
ruin
it
over
time
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
first
oatmeal
stout
and
i
am
definitely
impressed
with
samuel
smiths
offering
drinkability
the
smoothness
and
the
mild
roasted
malt
profile
make
this
a
very
easy
to
drink
stout
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
but
overall
i
prefer
other
types
of
stout
such
as
american
stouts
dry
stouts
foreign
stouts
and
imperial
stouts
as
many
said
before
me
this
is
an
amazing
beer
this
beer
has
obviously
been
reviewd
alot
but
will
just
add
that
this
beer
is
part
of
what
got
me
to
liking
better
beers
and
darker
beers
if
you
have
friends
who
are
hooked
on
water
beer
something
like
this
would
be
nice
for
them
to
try
looks
dark
but
doesnt
taste
to
dark
someone
used
to
bud
light
isnt
gonna
take
well
to
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
ale
or
new
beliums
trippel
so
something
like
an
oatmeal
stout
is
a
perfect
great
beer
without
the
bite
of
some
other
styles
good
coffee
chocolate
nose
with
great
depth
the
taste
was
real
big
sweet
chocolatey
with
a
bitter
end
note
this
is
really
an
end
to
end
desription
but
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
between
as
well
cant
describe
it
very
dry
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
a
very
highly
recommended
beer
i
think
it
will
be
an
awesome
after
dinner
drink
really
impressed
with
this
one
overall
a
nice
beer
quite
different
in
taste
from
the
average
stout
fruity
strong
taste
for
a
low
abv
im
happy
that
sam
smith
didnt
disappoint
me
recommendable
d
rather
a
full
taste
for
a
5
abv
surprisingly
fruity
for
a
stout
another
good
beer
from
sam
smith
a
great
all
around
oatmeal
stout
i
could
drink
this
daily
overall
this
beer
served
itself
well
as
a
highly
regarded
oatmeal
stout
definitely
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
could
have
easily
had
another
couple
of
mugs
pleasant
and
refreshing
but
with
just
enough
body
it
leaves
you
quite
content
taste
is
sweet
milky
chocolate
with
a
slightly
sour
flavor
and
a
bit
of
roast
the
carbonation
is
low
and
it
is
not
as
creamy
feeling
as
i
expect
in
an
oatmeal
stout
there
is
also
a
bit
of
fruitiness
that
detracts
from
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
maybe
it
is
the
brewery
but
i
have
yet
to
be
overly
impressed
with
a
sam
smiths
beer
its
a
good
brew
no
doubt
but
i
can
think
of
more
than
a
few
other
oaty
stouts
i
would
pick
before
this
one
the
foam
was
thick
semidark
wheat
in
color
smooth
and
lacey
the
color
was
deepdark
opaque
chocolate
brown
cola
the
smell
was
a
deep
oatmeal
with
chocolate
highlights
nutty
accents
and
a
barley
overtone
the
taste
was
crisp
thick
deepness
of
oatmeal
and
slight
chocolate
accents
nice
hops
andd
wheat
balance
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
crisp
thick
and
semilight
viscous
drinkability
a
real
good
crisp
stout
the
only
thing
i
really
didnt
like
about
this
beer
was
the
somewhat
watered
down
feel
in
the
aftertaste
overall
not
to
bad
good
full
creamy
body
i
recommend
this
to
everyone
a
favorite
d
so
tasty
i
could
drink
this
all
day
unfortunately
its
not
the
most
affordable
brew
but
if
you
want
to
know
what
an
oatmeal
stout
can
taste
like
this
is
it
mouth
is
delightful
and
smooth
drinks
slowly
but
great
for
the
style
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
head
that
hangs
in
there
well
the
aroma
is
some
chocolate
and
a
little
alki
the
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
sourness
but
i
do
not
get
much
coffee
feel
was
rich
and
smooth
but
not
heavy
drinkability
was
typical
for
a
stout
youd
like
to
but
its
just
too
sweet
and
heavy
to
make
a
night
of
it
drinkability
a
5abv
oaty
stout
session
beer
notes
i
would
prefer
a
ris
rather
than
an
oatmeal
stout
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
beer
to
finish
that
night
off
with
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
it
left
me
feeling
a
bit
full
when
drunk
quickly
i
feel
that
this
is
a
beer
worth
sipping
pleasing
finger
head
of
tan
bubbles
the
largest
pop
swiftly
leaving
denser
foam
to
settle
across
the
surface
moderate
stickiness
to
the
lacing
mostly
black
at
some
angles
you
can
see
dark
brown
to
orange
hues
but
not
much
very
fragrant
nose
of
black
grape
blackberry
fruit
black
licorice
and
sweetened
coffee
hard
toffee
minor
oats
and
other
grains
nothing
bitter
here
very
dominated
by
the
fruit
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
has
a
fine
prickle
to
it
and
keeps
things
spinning
around
the
palate
more
sheer
roast
in
the
coffee
flavors
bringing
out
more
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
as
a
result
hint
of
witchhazel
remains
noticeably
grapey
you
also
get
red
plum
cherry
and
blueberry
fruit
good
grip
not
too
creamy
stands
up
for
itself
and
not
over
ingratiating
the
toast
also
teases
out
additional
breadiness
good
length
as
it
finishes
dries
out
steadily
tidy
ending
quite
clear
that
this
is
british
and
not
american
made
have
not
had
this
in
a
log
time
and
a
perfect
session
beer
not
real
heavy
but
it
can
leave
you
full
probably
better
sipped
and
enjoyed
overalla
complex
beer
with
lots
of
layers
worthy
of
a
try
for
the
hype
alone
but
i
think
it
just
didnt
measure
up
to
its
name
d
this
could
easily
be
a
session
for
nights
where
i
want
malt
and
lots
of
it
because
sam
smiths
is
so
easy
to
find
i
will
give
it
consideration
next
time
im
looking
for
something
cheap
and
malty
d
as
mentioned
this
is
a
heavy
beer
but
it
manages
to
sit
pretty
light
in
the
stomach
obviously
a
few
of
these
will
fill
you
up
but
they
wont
make
you
feel
overstuffed
or
bloated
i
would
never
turn
one
of
these
down
one
of
my
favorites
great
stout
will
be
drinking
again
pours

fingers
of

light
aroma
for
a
stout
not
as
much
burnt

smells
as
most
stouts
very
mild
and
balanced
flavor
i
dont
taste
much
oatmeal
but
the
flavors
do
have
nice
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
excellent
mouthfeel
carbonation

on
nice

drinkable

nb
beer
tasting
is
easier
without

jumping
up
and
down
on
your
lap
pours
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
with
a
bit
of
redness
around
the
edges
where
the
light
fights
to
get
through
initially
it
has
an
amazing
creamy
3
finger
head
that
slowly
receeds
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
about
the
previously
touched
sections
of
the
glass
deep
smell
reveals
traces
of
burnt
grains
chocolate
and
little
bits
of
coffee
taking
a
deep
gulp
it
has
that
rich
smoothness
you
would
expect
with
anything
advertising
the
name
oatmeal
immediate
flavors
of
overripened
dark
fruit
coffee
chocolate
and
burnt
barleyhop
bitterness
brings
in
the
finish
the
carbination
is
enough
to
make
your
tongue
tingle
quite
inviting
for
the
next
sip
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
each
sip
is
a
reminder
that
this
beverage
is
well
balanced
if
only
i
had
another
overall
im
a
huge
ss
fan
this
one
isnt
my
favorite
but
it
lives
up
to
my
standards
for
this
brewery
not
great
but
pretty
good
no
it
doesnt
do
it
for
me
overall
its
just
too
light
and
a
little
to
sickly
it
needs
some
depth
and
body
behind
it
there
are
some
decent
characters
but
there
are
also
some
odd
notes
that
put
me
off
this
is
extremely
drinkable
stuff
with
smooth
pleasant
flavours
it
does
venture
into
sweet
territory
at
the
back
but
its
balanced
enough
for
the
most
part
to
make
it
quaffable
overall
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
it
isnt
on
the
top
of
my
list
but
it
is
worth
a
try
one
of
their
better
beers
in
my
opinion
overall
very
solid
brew
got
it
on
sale
and
it
was
worth
every
scent
drinkability
one
of
the
top
stouts
out
there
loved
and
will
drink
again
d
a
truly
world
class
stout
the
flavours
are
beautifully
balanced
and
complimentary
and
the
feel
is
of
silk
this
oatmeal
stout
is
an
example
of
why
samuel
smiths
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
the
planet
drinkability
is
great
finishes
clean
and
dryish
quite
a
feat
considering
the
huge
body
the
beer
has
leaving
you
ready
for
another
sip
d
wow
my
first
sam
smiths
and
im
amazed
how
they
get
a
beer
this
robust
in
5
abv
my
first
true
stout
from
englad
and
what
an
experience
i
can
see
how
these
guys
have
lasted
so
long
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
sam
smiths
other
brews
brown
ale
and
impy
stout
are
first
on
the
list
this
is
a
must
have
for
the
beer
lover
and
especially
for
the
stout
lover
another
huge
shout
out
for
porters
pub
in
easton
pa
drinkability
id
say
this
is
where
it
bogs
down
a
bit
as
id
have
a
hard
time
putting
too
many
of
these
back
due
to
its
nature
the
abv
is
low
but
drinks
harder
than
that
still
an
excellent

finish
and
sort
of

nice
creamy
cabsavit
leaves
you
with
a
very
full
mouthfeel
on
the
palette
almost
like
you
have
just
had
a
small
meal
in
a
beer
quite
a
intrigiuing
beer
and
definately
stands
alone
in
its
catergory
but
probably
couldnt
have
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
oats
a
touch
of
fruit
taste
is
good
dark
fruit
oats
a
hint
of
coffee
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
cheers
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
incredible
tastes
like
its
aroma
just
with
more
substance
to
it
the
roasted
malts
balance
its
bitter
hops
nicely
there
are
definitely
some
roasted
nuts
in
the
flavor
as
well
and
a
hint
of
coffee
with
a
thick
creaminess
that
makes
it
drink
like
a
meal
oatmeal
character
is
definitely
noticeable
in
the
flavor
and
the
feel
d
one
of
the
first
really
high
quality
beers
i
ever
had
i
still
remember
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
knowing
that
it
was
something
special
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
while
still
having
tons
of
flavor
its
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
and
not
too
expensive
all
around
exceptional
the
drinkability
is
easy
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
and
one
that
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
stouts
will
enjoy
samuel
smiths
beers
continue
to
amaze
me
with
their
delicious
flavours
complexity
and
brilliant
drinkability
their
oatmeal
stout
takes
its
rightful
place
as
my
favourite
stout
in
the
world
more
please
drinkability
i
havent
had
one
of
these
for
almost
ten
years
until
tonight
in
college
we
called
it
sweet
nectar
of
the
gods
but
could
rarely
afford
it
now
i
have
no
excuse
you
probably
dont
either
this
is
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
and
at
about
5
you
can
drink
it
all
night
and
day
poured
into
a
sams
perfect
pint
glass
had
a
nice
appearance
to
it
not
too
dark
for
an
oatmeal
stout
and
didnt
have
too
much
of
a
foam
head
that
was
an
off
white
color
it
lingers
around
sticking
to
the
glass
even
after
your
done
it
seems
to
look
better
after
you
start
drinking
it
has
a
nice
chocolate
molasses
and
grainy
aroma
to
it
feels
very
nice
on
the
pallet
almost
drinks
like
a
porter
seems
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
most
stouts
its
also
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
stout
as
well
d
not
bad
would
be
near
perfect
if
they
could
somehow
toss
that
metallic
flavor
out
of
there
and
make
it
a
bit
creamier
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
once
you
begin
to
pour
this
exceptional
brew
you
see
why
this
beer
is
rated
so
highly
color
and
head
are
enticing
the
aroma
could
be
a
little
stronger
but
this
is
dependent
upon
several
factors
which
are
not
presently
favoring
this
aspect
i
e
glassware
allergies
etc
nevertheless
the
flavor
is
creamy
coffeelike
slightly
sweet
and
a
wonderful
bitter
finish
that
completes
it
there
is
an
initial
fruity
character
like
prunes
or
raisins
one
of
the
best
stouts
and
beers
this
is
gonna
be
a
new
favorite
in
my
fridge
the
mouthfeel
really
pushes
this
beer
over
the
edge
while
still
being
a
great
sipper
that
does
not
becoming
cloying
at
any
time
marvelous
drinkability
i
would
not
have
thought
a
stout
could
be
this
drinkable
overall
im
really
impressed
this
beer
brings
good
flavor
and
a
high
drinkability
very
good
for
desert
or
a
session
d
quite
tasty
stout
nice
combination
of
flavors
i
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
of
these
although
it
would
probably
compliment
a
winter
day
better
than
an
afternoon
in
june
i
have
to
say
that
its
not
as
thick
or
heavy
as
id
expect
for
any
kind
of
stout
its
nice
to
be
able
to
put
away
a
few
of
these
the
complexity
and
carbonation
keeps
it
moving
but
not
too
quickly
this
brew
is
worth
savoring
and
dissecting
nothing
special
although
i
did
enjoy
it
not
too
thick
and
rich
tasting
for
the
price
i
need
more
kick
abv
there
are
better
values
with
better
taste
out
there
like
the
sam
adams
imperial
oatmeal
stout
not
sorry
i
bought
it
but
i
wont
do
it
again
d
i
could
sit
around
and
smell
this
beer
all
night
id
rather
drink
it
all
night
and
i
could
easily
do
that
the
taste
and
smoothness
combine
to
make
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
at
5
abv
it
wont
knock
me
down
if
i
put
a
few
away
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
this
is
an
outstanding
stout
i
was
blown
away
with
the
richness
of
this
beer
as
well
as
the
outstanding
mouthfeel
i
loved
everything
about
this
stout
this
thing
hits
the
spot
nearly
flawless
and
did
i
mention
that
it
was
overly
indulgent
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
pints
on
a
toasty
evening
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
ah
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
one
and
i
highly
recommend
that
you
try
this
cheers
drinkability
is
high
doesnt
go
to
any
extreme
that
would
inhibit
its
drinkability
and
abv
is
relatively
low
and
not
very
noticeable
excellent
beer
i
enjoyed
it
just
started
to
get
into
beer
as
a
hobby
but
i
liked
this
in
all
catagories
enjoyed
the
smell
could
taate
the
oatmeal
every
drinkable
fancy
bottle
was
550
milliliters
18
7
fluid
ounces
enjoyed
while
sitting
on
pation
watching
the
world
go
by
very
nice
hands
down
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
tasted
another
solid
brew
out
of
tadcaster
england
cheers
i
know
samuel
smith
is
credited
for
the
revivification
of
this
style
in
1980
but
i
can
see
room
for
improvementexperimentation
i
would
prefer
a
heavier
body
and
a
greater
intensity
of
flavors
maybe
more
oatmeal
higher
abv
still
this
is
one
i
return
to
with
pleasure
and
anticipation
everytime
this
is
also
just
the
thing
to
nudge
guinness
lovers
a
few
babysteps
forward
beyond
the
macro
world
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
but
this
one
is
still
very
good
md
velvety
mouthfeel
and
a
smooth
aftertaste
that
was
very
nice
loved
this
one
thanks
brown
bottle
for
saving
me
and
allowing
me
to
consume
you
once
again
d
very
high
its
so
nice
to
have
just
a
regular
stout
once
in
a
while
this
is
a
great
beer
classic
example
of
a
stout
and
great
flavor
for
the
sessionability
awesome
beer
poured
into
a
regular
pint
glass
pours
a
thin
black
with
a
very
light
head
this
one
doesnt
smell
too
strong
but
you
can
smell
the
oatmeal
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
almost
a
beginners
stout
with
very
little
bitterness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
smooth
semisweet
i
could
drink
a
4
pack
and
go
back
for
more
drinkability
very
high
a
good
oatmeal
stout
not
my
favorite
but
recommend
highly
inexpensive
as
well
lower
in
alcohol
d
i
could
have
a
couple
its
not
something
i
can
drink
all
night
drinkability
is
very
high
here
i
could
drink
this
from
the
second
the
sun
went
down
until
i
couldnt
drink
any
more
dont
think
i
could
handle
this
one
outside
on
a
hot
day
though
as
with
most
stouts
d
low
abv
decent
taste
serving
type
bottle
d
despite
flaws
still
a
very
worthy
contender
in
this
category
d
seems
like
it
could
be
a
session
type
if
its
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
nice
dark
and
opaque
black
with
a
large
amount
of
head
that
dissipates
after
a
while
also
leaves
a
generous
amount
of
lacing
while
drinking
smells
great
toasted
malts
and
roastiness
like
a
coffee
and
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
throughout
tastes
even
better
with
a
sort
of
creaminess
at
first
and
a
chewiness
towards
the
end
definite
tastes
of
molasses
or
brown
sugar
with
some
lingering
tastes
of
oatmeal
in
the
mouth
damn
delicious
beer
definitely
a
stout
to
look
for
mmm
ive
got
a
newfound
love
of
sammy
smith
beers
certainly
not
lacking
in
taste
at
all
d
easily
the
best
nonimperial
stout
ive
ever
head
its
amazing
how
a
beer
this
small
can
pack
so
much
flavor
if
only
samuel
smith
imperial
stout
were
this
good
a
bit
heavy
to
throw
back
a
lot
nevertheless
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
tried
yet
and
one
ill
definitely
be
going
back
to
when
i
get
the
chance
this
is
the
quintessential
session
beer
at
5
youre
not
going
to
find
many
other
session
brews
so
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
glass
as
i
always
do
black
in
color
with
a
nice
mochaish
head
excellent
lacing
great
body
like
your
mom
very
sweet
tasting
for
a
stout
nodes
of
burnt
coffee
and
chocolate
nice
malty
taste
and
excellent
drinkability
for
an
oatmeal
stout
really
good
beer
here
18
7oz
bottle
pours
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
toffee
along
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
tastes
dark
and
roasty
with
a
lot
of
chocolate
character
and
some
metallic
notes
in
the
background
some
strange
almost
vegetal
notes
from
this
bottle
sweet
finish
thick
creamy
body
pretty
impressive
this
was
the
first
oatmeal
stout
id
ever
had
and
got
me
drinking
them
all
thanks
to
a
buddy
from
work
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
almost
a
ruby
color
around
the
edges
with
the
pour
comes
a
decent
sized
off
white
light
tan
head
that
goes
down
fairly
quickly
after
the
pour
but
still
leaves
a
small
head
for
a
while
leaving
some
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
fairly
the
same
with
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
and
is
kind
of
sweet
has
a
sort
of
medium
feel
to
it
and
is
a
little
creamy
with
a
low
abv
i
think
this
one
is
very
drinkable
seems
to
go
down
really
fast
i
would
love
to
have
another
another
top
beer
from
samuel
smith
ive
had
a
handful
of
oatmeal
stouts
and
i
think
this
one
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
not
something
id
usually
be
in
the
mood
for
but
lets
call
it
a
top
choice
for
breakfast
or
dessert
im
not
sure
how
drinkable
oatmeal
stouts
typically
are
but
man
i
want
another
one
of
these
so
i
think
that
says
a
lot
subtle
and
delicious
drinkability
a
very
good
stout
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
not
as
sweet
or
creamy
as
some
stouts
and
with
more
bite
but
very
good
in
its
own
right
almost
too
drinkable
fpr
something
this
tasty
stay
away
from
the
12oz
bottles
and
stick
to
the
big
boys
i
liked
this
beer
alot
i
find
that
samuel
smiths
are
almost
always
spoton
when
it
comes
to
meeting
expectations
on
their
style
nothing
amazing
but
solid
and
very
good
i
poured
from
a
cold
550
ml
bottle
into
a
room
temp
pint
glass
appears
dark
with
nice
amber
hues
when
held
to
the
light
a
thick
foamy
head
makes
an
appearance
but
doesnt
stay
for
too
long
leaving
just
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
are
fairly
subtle
roasted
malts
light
on
the
hoppiness
and
some
coffee
like
smell
but
nothing
real
sweet
tasted
great
very
creamy
with
a
nice
roasted
flavor
with
oats
and
balanced
by
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
that
doesnt
linger
long
at
the
finish
didnt
notice
much
else
except
some
burnt
coffeecaramelesque
flavors
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
silky
just
a
mild
bit
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
lively
not
too
heavy
but
certainly
not
thin
i
found
it
drinkable
but
not
in
a
way
that
i
would
want
to
put
down
2
or
3
bottles
a
satisfying
oatmeal
stout
been
enjoying
this
one
for
years
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
tight
fluffy
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
roasted
grains
caramelized
malts
molasses
milk
chocolate
a
touch
of
toffee
and
mocha
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
this
beer
never
dissapoints
a
world
class
beverage
d
very
high
a
supremely
smooth
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
certainly
the
benchmark
for
the
style
d
its
medium
body
lends
itself
well
to
drinkability
in
the
oatmeal
stout
category
drinkability
the
balance
of
this
stout
really
sets
it
apart
from
most
other
renditions
it
was
voted
the
number
4
session
beer
so
i
got
myself
one
and
wasnt
dissapointed
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
and
enjoyably
a
brilliant
beer
pours
black
with
a
thick
beige
colored
head
good
lacing
down
the
glass
there
are
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
aromas
good
mouthfeel
not
too
watery
and
not
too
thick
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
sweet
coffee
flavors
great
flavor
and
perfectly
balanced
d
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
samual
smith
i
have
had
it
more
then
once
so
i
do
find
it
drinkable
grab
a
few
of
these
and
get
yourself
some
pizza
cheers
notes
this
is
the
third
time
ive
tasted
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
and
each
time
it
impresses
me
with
how
easily
it
goes
down
it
isnt
the
best
looking
the
most
flavorful
the
smoothest
or
even
the
best
example
of
the
style
out
there
but
its
still
a
darn
good
beer
i
prefer
my
stouts
a
little
less
sweet
and
a
little
heavier
but
if
youre
looking
for
an
introduction
into
stouts
this
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
having
read
all
the
ratings
reviews
first
my
expectations
were
too
high
definitely
a
good
beerstout
and
i
will
buy
this
again
but
i
guess
i
was
expecting
to
find
the
holy
grail
of
stouts
and
i
just
dont
see
this
as
standing
out
above
the
pack
overall
a
good
sweet
stout
that
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
very
dark
appearance
when
you
pour
it
out
of
the
bottle
into
the
glass
tons
of
dark
tan
head
which
is
thick
like
a
cake
sitting
on
top
smells
of
roasted
barley
the
first
taste
you
get
is
sweetness
on
your
tongue
then
the
flavors
change
as
time
goes
on
the
stout
is
heavy
and
definitely
the
roasted
flavor
very
smooth
not
like
a
dry
irish
stout
i
really
like
this
one
with
some
oaty
hints
ive
not
found
many
english
beers
that
i
would
rank
among
my
favorites
not
sure
what
it
is
maybe
the
water
this
one
is
the
best
ive
tasted
so
far
medium
to
light
body
on
this
one
i
would
almost
prefer
a
heavier
body
but
still
a
very
good
beer
non
the
less
the
drinkability
factor
is
great
truly
a
sessionable
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
samuel
smith
remains
the
king
of
the
english
ales
and
stouts
in
my
mind
thus
far
this
slightly
offcentered
oatmeal
stout
is
certainly
no
exception
think
of
a
hybrid
dry
irish
stout
with
a
milk
or
cream
stout
added
to
the
balance
and
youve
got
this
stout
in
your
hand
now
sip
and
enjoy
coffee
what
great
mouthfeelchewy
and
sweet
this
is
one
you
could
drink
all
night
d
i
would
end
any
and
every
night
with
this
beer
its
a
great
session
and
a
great
sipper
pours
a
black
beer
with
a
creamy
tan
foam
head
awesome
looking
stout
just
as
i
expected
smells
almost
like
a
coffee
nuts
molasses
etc
the
taste
is
of
oats
some
chocolaty
undertones
has
a
great
full
bodied
taste
and
mouth
feel
has
a
almost
bittersweet
finish
some
lacing
on
my
pint
glass
this
stout
looks
smeels
and
tastes
delicious
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
very
drinkable
almost
like
a
dessert
beer
i
have
not
had
several
at
a
time
so
i
am
not
sure
how
full
this
would
make
me
but
an
awsome
brew
none
the
less
there
is
a
reason
that
this
beer
is
one
of
the
benchmark
oatmeal
stouts
it
looks
great
it
tastes
great
it
feels
great
and
one
could
easily
make
a
night
out
of
a
few
the
oatmeal
doesnt
present
itself
as
much
in
the
taste
as
it
does
in
the
feel
giving
it
that
classic
chewy
feeling
unless
you
are
allergic
to
stouts
this
is
a
musttry
drinkability
when
in
the
mood
for
an
oatmeal
stout
theres
nothing
better
than
sam
smiths
as
a
beer
overall
moderate
drinkability
doverall
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
and
would
have
again
d
moderate
certainly
not
the
type
of
beer
you
would
want
to
speed
through
much
better
when
enjoyed
slowly
giving
it
time
to
warm
the
light
pleasant
taste
paired
with
overall
good
mouthfeel
makes
this
stout
easy
to
have
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
while
then
fades
to
a
thin
cap
leaving
loads
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
has
lots
of
sweet
chocolatesome
vanilla
and
licorice
notes
and
a
hint
of
grain
flavor
is
kind
of
like
those
chocolate
oatmeal
nobake
cookies
with
a
hint
of
vanillasmokeand
a
kiss
of
bitter
coffee
at
the
finish
a
medium
to
full
creamy
mouthfeelwith
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
well
built
stout
by
any
measure
drinkability
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
pack
down
dont
get
me
wrong
im
a
fiend
for
dark
beer
porter
or
stout
or
schwartzbeer
id
recommend
anderson
valley
barney
flatts
oatmeal
stout
tastier
to
me
just
as
silky
d
not
a
gulper
you
have
to
take
your
time
with
this
one
it
must
be
embraced
sip
by
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
and
silky
as
expected
from
the
oats
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
brew
excellent
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
that
i
would
recommend
poured
black
into
its
own
glass
tan
head
a
frothy
one
finger
with
good
lacing
smells
of
a
chocolate
cake
sweet
brown
sugar
burnt
coffee
taste
had
nice
balanced
bitterness
and
with
air
took
on
a
nuttier
bitter
chocolate
taste
and
feel
a
few
hints
of
molasses
in
the
mix
as
well
as
a
biscotti
chewiness
considering
the
taste
i
found
the
body
lighter
than
expected
smooth
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
brazil
nut
overall
this
is
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
well
deserving
of
a
place
in
your
cellar
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
sweeter
than
i
expected
and
smooth
drinker
flavor
is
very
good
touch
of
sugar
sweetness
dark
fruit
grainy
and
roasty
malt
aftertaste
is
drier
with
light
coffee
notes
very
soft
and
smooth
but
i
wish
it
werent
quite
so
carbonated
aside
from
that
the
mouthfeel
was
great
medium
but
slightly
chewy
pretty
delicious
overall
probably
the
best
english
stout
ive
had
yet
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
a
joy
to
drink
d
at
5
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
with
the
robust
flavors
i
could
drink
a
few
witout
getting
bored
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
an
oatmeal
stout
that
ive
had
i
enjoy
everything
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
overall
my
favorite
release
from
samuel
smith
brownblack
pour
2
finger
light
brown
head
smells
well
like
a
stout
taste
pretty
dang
good
extremely
smooth
and
a
nice
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
sweet
but
not
even
close
to
being
sickly
taste
like
dark
roasted
coffee
in
the
end
for
me
hops
shows
up
just
enough
to
balance
this
one
out
nice
brew
i
really
like
this
one
overall
this
is
a
quite
good
beer
and
definitely
a
good
oatmeal
stout
i
do
feel
there
are
some
things
that
could
be
done
to
improve
it
but
given
the
consistent
quality
it
isnt
necessary
the
overall
product
is
very
drinkable
d
was
a
chore
to
finish
drinkability
light
and
very
tasty
for
an
oatmeal
stout
i
can
easily
see
why
this
is
one
of
bas
most
sessionable
brews
d
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
a
good
dark
session
beer
another
great
offering
from
samuel
smith
tyou
can
definitely
taste
the
oats
and
bread
in
this
stout

smooth
and
easy
to
drink

is
great

beautiful
english
stout
and

hallmark
of
the

i
dont
love
stouts
in
general
but
i
do
love
this
one
it
scores
high
in
every
category
and
i
really
dig
the
tastes
which
would
make
it
my
first
choice
to
date
for
a
oat
stout
this
could
be
a
sessionable
stout
if
needed
uk
drinkers
wonder
why
us
beer
geeks
worship
sam
smith
and
im
starting
to
pay
attention
to
the
man
behind
the
curtain
too
not
their
best
and
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
either
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
definitely
not
the
thickness
of
other
stouts
i
have
tried
not
to
repeat
myself
but
it
is
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
sweet
fastfinishing
easy
drinking
delighful
notes
like
all
of
samuel
smiths
offerings
an
excellent
beer
this
is
the
archetype
of
oatmeal
stouts
drinkability
i
honestly
have
to
say
that
this
could
possibly
be
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
wait
a
few
moments
after
each
sip
and
savor
the
complex
flavors
that
continue
to
dance
on
the
palate
each
sip
begs
for
another
to
follow
what
a
treat
painfully
delicious
going
down
easily
yet
begging
for
a
slow
sip
to
enjoy
the
rich
velvety
roasty
nature
of
the
beer
this
is
one
of
the
first
brews
that
i
enjoyed
in
my
foray
into
the
vast
world
of
fermented
grain
beverages
and
one
of
the
onesif
not
the
onethat
made
me
realize
that
beer
can
be
so
much
more
than
a
pale
hoppy
brew
oatmeal
stout
still
ceases
to
amaze
me
and
its
nearextinction
ceases
to
amaze
me
even
more
excellent
english
oatmeal
stout
very
mellow
brownish
appearance
greets
me
upon
opening
this
beer
smell
is
very
pleasant
like
newly
baked
bread
with
a
cinnamon
smell
upon
decanting
it
to
a
fine
guinness
ale
glass
it
tastes
rich
and
mellow
with
hints
of
clove
oatmeal
and
a
nice
malty
finish
it
is
strong
but
never
has
any
bite
to
go
with
the
alcohol
its
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
less
bitter
than
guinness
bottled
the
only
good
versions
for
me
were
on
tap
and
in
the
draught
bottles
and
cans
with
the
widget
mellow
easily
drinkable
rich
complex
taste
and
easily
quaffable
too
interesting
to
be
a
session
beer
i
would
give
samuel
smith
an
a
for
this
beer
makes
me
feel
warm
and
friendly
drinking
one
recommended
for
most
drinkers
i
poured
from
a
550
ml
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
black
with
ruby
highlights
a
big
white
fluffy
head
forms
that
will
just
not
go
away
the
nose
is
sweet
with
hints
of
coffee
and
black
licorice
the
black
licorice
really
comes
through
on
the
first
sip
the
finish
is
sweet
and
crisp
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
wonderfull
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
meant
to
be
sipped
but
i
would
not
have
a
problem
quaffing
this
one
a
very
good
beer
4
m4
d
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
throughout
and
not
heavy
judging
by
its
nearly
rich
flavoura
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
stout
with
a
good
fruity
and
nutty
backbone
d
gets
sweeter
as
you
go
along
very
drinkable
bitter
dark
malt
at
first
then
sweet
and
creamy
toffee
milk
chocolate
and
more
creamy
goodness
the
dark
malt
bitter
returns
again
with
swallow
did
i
mention
this
beer
was
creamy
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
acquires
a
cola
taste
as
it
warms
which
is
a
bummer
d
easily
drinkable
and
is
somewhat
of
a
standard
for
the
kind
i
can
see
why
this
brew
has
high
marks
and
it
aims
to
please
but
i
still
find
this
stout
timid
in
some
regards
btw
goes
great
with
cake
drinkability
not
my
ideal
style
but
good
one
of
these
is
plenty
for
me
pretty
good
but
only
one
of
these
at
a
time
would
do
d
the
classic
oatmeal
stout
to
which
all
others
are
compared
wellrounded
moderate
abv
and
extremely
flavorful
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
id
say
it
is
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
had
it
is
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
stout
though
like
i
said
it
is
thiner
than
a
lot
of
stouts
which
may
add
to
that
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
as
assertive
as
its
appearance
would
lead
you
to
believe
d
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
these
flavors
and
the
low
abv
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
overall
not
something
id
seek
out
again
anytime
soon
honestly
it
feels
more
like
im
drinking
soda
instead
of
beer
im
just
not
impressed
by
this
d
a
variant
of
stout
that
too
few
brewers
produce
the
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
a
sweet
stout
and
not
as
dry
as
a
dry
stout
which
makes
it
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
several
however
balance
has
its
price
and
few
would
rate
this
as
their
all
time
favorite
stout
a
very
smooth
feel
but
maybe
a
bit
rich
for
some
id
cap
it
off
at
one
bottle
per
sitting
but
that
is
not
to
say
i
would
not
want
another
later
on
down
the
line
overall
a
fine
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
is
decent
on
this
but
it
is
rich
that
i
could
never
conceive
of
drinking
more
than
two
of
these
oatmeal
stouts
in
one
evening
cheers
pours
a
light
khaki
head
and
settles
to
a
deep
dark
chocolate
with
only
a
hint
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
the
nose
starts
with
an
acohol
warning
developing
into
a
dark
fruit
rich
and
inviting
the
flavor
of
figs
and
dates
bubbles
acrossed
the
tongue
falling
back
into
a
complex
flash
of
caramel
malts
and
soft
sweet
oatmeal
before
finishing
with
the
brewerys
characteristic
granite
finish
begging
for
another
sip
i
could
drink
the
case
tonight
drinkability
is
good
but
enjoy
this
one
by
itself
probably
not
good
with
food
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
when
i
cracked
this
one
open
and
so
this
truly
wondrous
product
definitely
caught
me
by
surprise
a
dark
dark
pour
with
a
nice
creamy
head
and
significant
lacing
looks
very
appealing
the
taste
here
was
truly
exceptional
oatmeal
as
the
name
would
suggest
but
a
great
balance
of
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
with
intricate
complexity
and
not
too
dry
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
sampled
highly
recommended
note
i
loved
this
beer
ive
been
looking
for
it
for
a
while
and
its
been
sold
out
so
i
was
excited
when
i
finally
found
it
i
wanted
to
try
it
based
on
the
great
ratings
ive
seen
id
love
to
go
to
the
brewery
in
england
for
a
try
another
excellent
stout
from
samuel
smith
poured
dark
with
an
offwhite
head
very
earthy
roasty
nose
taste
is
full
of
creamy
roastchocolate
simply
felt
amazing
on
the
tongue
it
glides
all
over
the
mouth
almost
begging
to
linger
this
is
an
excellent
stout
a
very
good
stout
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
a
good
tasty
example
of
the
style
d
very
drinkable
and
with
low
abv
could
have
tucked
in
to
this
one
for
the
duration
but
there
were
other
beers
to
drink
poured
from
a
450ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
producing
a
beige
colored
12
head
that
laces
the
glass
quite
well
as
i
drink
the
color
is
deep
deep
brownblack
excellent
after
dinner
beer
with
the
rich
creamy
flavor
of
roasted
toffee
and
oats
alcohol
is
balanced
perfectly
this
beer
is
rich
in
flavor
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
and
oatmeal
stout
smells
just
like
it
tastes
toffee
and
oats
i
love
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
stout
drinkability
is
good
yummy
this
beer
is
quite
smooth
goes
down
real
nice
and
is
one
the
best
stouts
ive
had
the
overall
feel
is
strong
but
does
not
overpower
drinkability
its
smoothness
made
this
easy
to
put
down
only
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
that
being
said
the
odd
chemicalastringent
taste
remained
throughout
the
entire
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
likely
wont
seek
it
out
again
the
first
few
tastes
off
of
this
one
gives
a
metallic
flavor
off
the
head
once
i
break
though
that
i
get
the
same
berry
taste
that
i
smelled
almost
like
a
grape
soda
this
is
very
smooth
beer
with
no
bite
what
so
ever
now
as
the
beer
settles
i
am
getting
a
nutty
flavor
i
also
pick
up
a
grape
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
that
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
poured
from
550ml
bottle
an
opaque
dark
brownblack
with
rocky
tan
head
that
fades
after
a
minute
smell
rich
roasted
and
milk
chocolate
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
earthiness
and
butterscotch
taste
sweet
with
milk
and
semisweet
chocolate
caramel
slight
dark
fruit
and
diacetyl
fairly
rich
and
sweet
but
balanced
by
the
drying
character
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
velvety
smooth
and
fairly
complex
for
the
style
with
a
notched
up
abv
this
would
be
really
impressive
notes
this
has
to
be
the
classic
oatmeal
stout
once
again
samuel
smith
elegantly
sets
the
bar
for
a
style
there
are
no
crazy
undertones
or
bells
and
whistles
with
this
beer
just
classic
stout
the
drinkability
is
just
great
too
the
only
problem
is
that
it
costs
a
bit
much
for
everyday
i
think
ill
just
save
this
one
for
special
occasions
notes
this
was
quite
a
brew
the
balance
was
near
perfectso
tasty
and
filling
no
letdowns
heresimply
a
smooth
and
creamy
treat
they
are
the
original
and
the
best
for
a
reason
some
may
feel
that
this
beer
has
retained
its
greatness
and
i
agree
to
a
degree
that
it
is
still
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
but
given
the
stout
competition
i
cannot
say
this
is
a
beer
for
which
i
am
going
to
rush
back
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
nice
carbonation
the
dry
finish
sets
up
perfectly
for
another
sip
very
drinkable
overall
a
great
stout
that
is
inexpensive
and
highly
drinkable
i
cant
say
its
anything
super
amazing
but
i
will
pick
up
more
d
a
great
oatmeal
stout
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
ill
be
breaking
this
out
on
special
occasions
i
was
expecting
this
to
dominate
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
like
but
found
for
the
price
i
will
stick
to
cheaper
os
althought
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
for
the
price
not
something
special
enough
to
keep
on
hand
all
the
time
note
smell
improves
greatly
as
it
warms
up
yep
it
was
a
good
call
this
is
an
awesome
stout
drinkabilty
oh
why
didnt
i
buy
more
than
just
this
20oz
bomber
its
been
years
since
ive
had
this
great
beer
i
guess
since
it
has
resided
on
so
many
good
beer
shelves
across
america
for
so
long
now
ive
tended
to
take
it
for
granted
but
im
hear
to
sing
the
renewed
praises
if
they
needed
to
be
sung
again
anyway
for
this
special
stout
it
is
truly
unique
and
such
a
pleasure
to
have
it
wont
be
too
long
before
i
buy
another
bomber
i
will
revisit
this
but
the
cost
means
that
there
will
be
long
waits
between
visits
nice
dry
oatmeal
stout
really
i
was
hoping
that
i
would
like
it
more
on
this
go
round
its
not
bad
or
anything
i
just
probably
wont
ever
buy
one
again
of
sam
smiths
lineup
ive
only
loved
the
taddy
porter
i
appreciate
most
of
their
beers
but
i
often
end
up
feeling
a
bit
underwhelmed
and
disappointed
this
beer
is
a
dry
stout
with
a
full
smooth
feel
its
dark
nearly
black
with
brown
highlights
at
the
extreme
edges
the
head
is
beige
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
chocolate
malt
with
that
dry
note
that
i
usually
associate
with
irish
dry
stouts
oh
guinness
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
its
the
best
part
of
the
beer
good
beer
but
not
great
my
girlfriend
demands
that
i
write
down
her
note
of
baconey
pours
very
dark
with
a
short
tannish
brown
head
smell
is
slight
of
roasted
oats
fantastic
semisweet
chocolatecaramel
taste
with
a
slight
hint
of
figraisindate
very
smooth
mouthfeel
definitely
inviting
to
drink
more
to
discover
all
the
flavors
very
black
pour
like
a
black
hole
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
a
tan
head
reminding
us
that
theres
life
out
there
somewhere
extremely
roasty
mouthfeel
that
warms
the
palate
and
the
belly
as
it
slides
on
down
this
beer
just
makes
a
guy
feel
loved
and
at
home
with
the
world
superb
d
i
think
this
beer
could
relate
to
any
palate
yes
sir
i
could
drink
this
day
and
night
night
and
day
truly
fantastic
be
sure
to
try
this
if
you
havent
already
poured
out
of
a
550ml
bottle
into
a
samuel
smiths
pint
glass
dark
black
body
with
a
halfinch
tan
head
and
thorough
sugary
lacing
all
throughout
the
glass
a
perfect
looking
stout
smell
is
sweet
nuts
faint
hop
aroma
and
oatmeal
taste
is
roasted
malt
piny
hops
black
licorice
leather
toasted
oats
and
a
charred
bitter
hop
aftertaste
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
velvety
silky
mouthfeel
has
a
crisp
dry
finish
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
ever
tasted
impressive
overall
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
st
ambroise
southern
tier
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
d
very
tasty
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
black
with
no
visibility
with
a
caramel
headingleaves
a
beautiful
caramel
lacing
smells
of
mollases
and
roasted
coffee
beansand
hints
of
honey
taste
bready
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
a
very
smooth
watery
mouthful
that
goes
down
very
smoothly
so
far
this
has
been
the
best
stout
i
have
tasted
the
beer
is
mediumfull
bodied
on
the
palate
with
a
chewy
rich
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
it
goes
down
extremely
well
which
i
kind
of
expected
from
its
low
abv
but
either
way
its
a
great
oatmeal
stout
top
of
the
line
skip
the
pretzels
go
straight
for
snackin
on
some
oatmeal
chocolate
cookies
when
enjoying
one
of
these
d
gotta
say
this
one
lived
up
to
my
expectations
but
i
think
i
can
find
better
representations
of
the
style
really
good
though
an
enjoyable
experience
sets
the
standard
for
oatmeal
stouts
in
my
opinion
you
cant
go
wrong
with
sammy
smiths
thanks
a
lot
to
jac5084
for
this
one
drinkability
a
lot
of
flavor
that
comes
together
i
could
definately
sip
on
this
beer
all
night
long
d
easy
to
drink
abv
is
not
high
for
the
beer
style
not
overly
filling
by
any
means
flavors
are
muted
so
it
wouldnt
become
a
wear
on
the
tongue
only
knock
here
is
the
existence
of
that
acidity
that
just
doesnt
go
well
over
a
session

any

of

if
you
are
looking
for
an

this
is
the
only
beer
you
should
be
drinking
this
is
the
best
os
on
the
market
bar
none
it
taste
just
like
a
bowl
of
cold
soupy
oatmeal
the
best
part
of
these
beer
is
the
fact
it
is
readily
available
and
fairly
reasonably
priced
d
very
high
goes
down
so
easy
the
low
abv
is
a
big
plus
too
d
this
richly
deserves

i
had
to
knock
this
beer
for
the

its
just
too
loose

watery
for
a
stout
oatmeal
or
otherwise
overall
a
very
good
stout
very
drinkable
i
can
certainly
see
why
its
celebrated
i
would
say
its
not
quite
as
good
as
the
tadcaster
porter
but
definitely
a
great
brew
worth
stocking
up
on
its
got
an
abv
that
could
definitely
make
it
a
prime
session

seeking

always
reliable
sam
smith
pours
a
blackbrown
light
tan
colored
head
smells
of
a
slightly
overcooked
oatmeal
cookie
nice
roast
coffee
and
chocolatey
tones
could
have
more
grain
and
oat
characteristics
just
enough
carbonation
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
warms
very
well
finish
very
clean
this
poured
an
opaque
ruby
with
dark
tan
head
it
smelled
like
dry
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
with
sweet
cream
and
a
hint
of
oats
it
tasted
like
milk
chocolate
sweet
vanilla
roasted
bitter
coffee
and
dry
toasted
oats
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
nice
complex
flavor
that
was
well
balanced
quite
clean
and
definitely
tasty
it
had
good
body
and
was
very
drinkable
there
was
honestly
nothing
extreme
or
exciting
about
this
beer
but
its
a
perfect
benchmark
for
what
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
no
frills
just
solid
d
another
great
samuel
smith
product
traditional
and
delicious
would
love
to
try
this
from
a
nitro
tap
d
tasty
brew
perfect
for
a
cold
winters
night
in
chicago
drinkability
for
an
stout
this
one
is
defintley
drinkable
although
for
the
style
there
is
definetley
better
choices
this
one
is
still
a
good
one
to
fall
back
on
fairly
sessionable
for
a
stout
a
tad
boring
for
an
stout
yet
the
maltiness
and
the
good
mouthfeel
make
this
a
better
brew
not
one
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
very
drinkable
overall
excellent
stout
one
of
if
not
the
best
ive
tried
very
good
fantastic
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
a
lot
at
the
right
temperature
the
nose
blows
me
away
great
stout
with
a
nice
creamy
palate
super
malty
chocolate
toasted
brown
sugar
taste
not
very
bitter
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
ever
a
very
dark
oil
with
a
tan
head
caramel
cream
oats
earthy
toasted
malt
a
hint
of
nuts
and
molasses
the
taste
is
oats
cereal
and
malt
taste
with
hints
of
cream
chocolate
and
molasses
has
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
a
nice
full
body
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
and
a
very
smooth
slightly
acidic
finish
from
the
hops
i
have
been
waiting
a
while
to
try
this
beer
now
i
know
what
the
hype
was
about
all
around
a
very
good
beer
must
stock
up
d
absolutely
perfect
drinkability
the
flavor
and
mixture
of
the
smoothness
are
just
perfect
it
goes
down
very
well
and
leaves
you
with
a
wonderful
aftertaste
slightly
refreshing
in
a
way
a
perfect
beer
to
drink
during
a
cold
day
as
the
richness
is
wonderful
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
pretty
much
the
defining
ale
of
this
genre
and
sam
smith
is
the
beer
geeks
coca
cola
widely
available
and
always
excellent
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
as
dark
as
youd
expect
from
a
stout
but
it
has
a
very
persistent
head
for
mouth
feel
and
rich
smoothness
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
cant
be
beat
theyve
got
the
carbonation
to
richnessthickness
ratio
just
right
this
stout
is
no
slouch
on
taste
either
theres
a
very
slight
estery
taste
here
but
it
has
a
very
pleasant
finish
i
think
sam
smiths
is
a
bit
sweeter
but
its
not
cloying
overall
a
well
rounded
stout
fantastic
really
high
drinkability
and
an
overall
enjoyable
experience
great
beer
drinkability
is
definately
high
due
to
a
modest
alcohol
percentage
and
delicious
overall
experience
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
but
not
too
thick
good
lacing
throughout
consumption
the
most
recognizable
scents
are
coffee
and
roasted
grains
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
of
coffee
but
it
is
possible
to
detect
some
oatmeal
taste
the
coffee
taste
does
a
very
good
job
of
disguising
the
alcohol
as
well
its
a
very
good
beer
a
great
example
of
the
style
one
to
savour
d
tasty
when
not
paired
with
chocolate
cake
extremely
sweet
and
drinkable
overall
a
good
brew
but
not
as
good
as
youngs
oatmeal
stout
i
wouldnt
pass
this
brew
up
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
its
sessionable
if
thats
a
word
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
in
a
night
personally
pretty
good
drinkable
beer
d
ill
want
more
its
tasty
and
drinkable
its
an
easy
drink
that
doesnt
demand
a
finely
tuned
taste
to
appreciate
the
carbonation
was
not
overpowering
like
you
see
with
some
hoppy
ales
it
felt
good
in
the
mouth
not
too
thick
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
nice
dark
tan
head
that
thins
half
way
through
smells
like
sweet
dark
chocolate
as
it
warms
maybe
milk
chocolate
i
taste
hints
of
oatmeal
definitely
some
sweet
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
unreal
from
the
look
i
thought
it
would
be
thick
this
beer
drinks
so
thin
the
texture
is
like
water
the
drinkability
is
the
same
goes
down
so
easy
very
enjoyable
and
highly
sessionable
at
the
abv
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
great
beer
serving
type
bottle
dgood
drinkability
a
quality
flavor
probably
one
of
my
first
oatmeal
stout
loves
due
to
its
easy
drinkability
and
enjoyable
qualities
as
i
progressed
through
the
bottle
it
did
start
to
feel
heavy
but
ill
surely
be
enjoying
this
one
again
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
d
a
rich
brew
that
will
not
disappoint
dark
beer
drinkers
and
quiet
possibly
win
more
of
their
lighter
bretherns
drinkers
over
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
thin
and
kinda
oily
this
gently
carbonated
beer
is
rich
on
the
tongue
nicely
balanced
and
has
a
long
finish
notes
a
real
classic
of
the
style
im
not
sure
why
i
dont
buy
this
stuff
more
often
especially
at
the
very
reasonable
price
of
3
per
550ml
bottle
i
used
to
drink
these
alot
but
havent
seen
it
in
a
while
around
here
pours
fairly
dark
but
you
can
still
see
through
it
not
too
much
of
a
head
kinda
thin
feel
overall
a
good
beer
that
isnt
too
strong
i
could
drink
this
beer
everyday
all
there
other
beers
are
good
also
a
damn
fine
stout
that
i
wish
i
could
get
year
round
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
that
really
outshines
most
others
in
this
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
all
in
all
a
phenomenal
stout
especially
when
taken
into
account
that
this
is
widely
available
a
good
stout
nothing
really
stood
out
good
or
bad
but
pretty
much
all
around
solid
kind
of
a
smooth
easy
drinker
stout
quite
easy
to
drink
while
full
bodied
this
beer
is
never
heavy
or
hard
to
get
down
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
will
return
to
mdsuper
silky
minimal
carbonation
makes
for
just
right
porridge
for
this
bear
not
heavy
eithera
super
balanced
beer
that
wears
its
age
on
its
sleeve
in
the
way
it
comes
together
tastewise
truly
refined
and
a
humdinger
of
a
beer
dont
miss
this
classic
of
the
style
if
youre
not
exactly
new
to
craft
beer
than
chances
are
good
that
youve
already
a
stout
that
is
fuller
richer
and
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
decadent
than
this
i
can
think
of
handful
in
the
same
oatmeal
stout
category
but
samuel
smith
is
who
we
have
to
thank
for
reviving
the
style
after
it
had
gone
extinct
before
the
first
world
war
and
considering
the
success
their
oatmeal
stout
has
had
at
it
i
think
thats
got
to
say
something
would
buy
this
again
and
again
price
was
steep
for
a
4
pack
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
believe
the
hype
this
is
an
awesome
oatmeal
stout
sweet
rich
not
too
thick
which
lends
to
drinkability
pours
dark
coffee
to
black
sweet
like
chocolate
up
front
with
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
complex
taste
and
good
both
cold
and
slightly
warmer
not
too
high
on
the
alcohol
content
which
prevents
it
from
losing
taste
a
classic
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
think
it
has
amazing
drinkability
and
flavor
for
a
relatively
low
abv
brew
this
is
probably
the
most
sessionable
stout
i
have
ever
had
the
amount
of
smooth
flavor
this
guy
can
pack
in
is
truly
awesome
will
definitely
reach
for
this
again
in
the
future
d
easy
to
drink
for
a

thick
and
not
too
thin

one
of
my

beers

of
years

outlook
repeat
business
imminent
blackest
night
of
a
brew
with
big
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
party
a
sweet
aroma
that
sifts
through
the
air
from
the
first
pour
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
oatmeal
cereal
and
some
dark
fruit
tastes
of
sweet
oatmeal
raisins
and
chocolate

a
great
after

could
be
a
dessert

wonderfully
rich

thatll

very
good
worth

and
worth

have
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
is
a
classic
english
stout
which
i
first
became
acquainted
with
over
a
decade
ago
its
been
a
couple
of
years
since
last
i
enjoyed
this
beer
having
come
to
love
the
bold
imperial
stouts
with
their
aggressive
american
hop
profiles
and
viscous
motor
oil
consistencies
i
find
this
a
significantly
thinner
milder
and
softer
stout
than
i
remember
but
no
less
delicious
still
a
classic
and
still
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
the
taste
is
just
great
there
is
a
definite
oatmeal
backbone
to
the
beer
and
it
comes
through
in
its
consistency
the
beer
has
wonderful
toasted
and
roasted
dark
malts
it
has
the
slightly
charred
grainy
notes
and
the
caramel
maltiness
to
make
it
a
delight
there
is
a
slight
butterscotch
flavor
to
the
beer
that
detracts
ever
so
slightly
but
this
one
is
well
worth
seeking
out
there
is
also
a
milkshake
quality
to
this
beer
and
it
has
the
characteristics
of
a
lactosemilk
stout
it
isnt
a
strong
abv
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
oily
with
an
aftertaste
that
is
not
overly
sweet
more
like
a
refreshing
complex
and
interesting
thick
chocolatey
after
dinner
drink
lchaim
could
enjoy
multiples
the
creamy
brew
settles
great
in
the
stomach
and
is
not
too
filling
d
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
and
is
so
far
my
favourite
offering
from
samuel
smiths
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
perfect
for
the
upcoming
cold
winter
nights
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
oatmeal
stout
and
another
fine
offering
by
sam
smith
moral
of
the
story
dont
drink
your
stouts
especially
this
one
too
cold
actually
dont
drink
just
about
any
beer
real
cold
this
is
a
perfect
example
how
much
aromas
flavors
and
feel
improve
with
some
time
out
of
the
fridge
samuel
smith
is
a
quality
brewery
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
ill
keep
coming
back
to
this
stuff
isnt
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
however
better
than
i
remember
it
from
years
past
ill
be
buying
it
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
if
youre
into
stouts
but
havent
tried
a
lot
of
unusual
ones
i
e
if
youre
a
guinness
drinker
i
entreat
you
to
try
one
or
two
of
these
good
stuff
this
brew
pours
up
black
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
the
nose
is
dark
malts
cherries
oats
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
ahhh
the
delicious
watered
down
malt
taste
like
almost
all
dark
english
ales
sarcasm
taste
is
the
same
as
nose
minus
the
cherries
slight
metallic
sweet
malt
finish
watery
medium
bodied
low
to
medium
carbo
im
not
a
fan
of
the
watered
down
english
ale
taste
but
this
surely
beats
youngs
oatmeal
stout
overall
the
caramel
flavor
kind
of
overwhelmed
me
i
give
it
good
points
because
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
this
is
a
nice
beer
ive
had
some
oatmeal
stouts
are
brewpubs
that
i
consider
much
better
but
this
one
is
a
winner
at
face
value
and
not
style
comparisons
etc
this
is
a
terrific
beer
that
you
can
have
more
than
one
of
and
not
feel
like
changing
gears
d
that
bitter
dry
feeling
calls
for
another
sip
and
another
and
another
d
ok
not
my
favorite
stout
too
light
and
watery
d
loved
this
beer
but
the
combination
of
the
tanginess
and
sour
bitterness
at
the
end
makes
this
an
in
moderation
drink
for
me
a
quality
stout
for
sure
d
very
presentable
id
share
this
with
an
honored
guest
d
it
was
a
medium
bodied
and
has
a
light
abv
but
the
biting
aftertaste
limits
this
to
a
one
and
out
beer
for
me
excellent
beer
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
enjoy
this
one
all
you
want
i
would
call
it
a
very
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
in
fact
if
you
closed
your
eyes
you
might
mistake
this
one
for
a
much
lighter
beer
its
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
its
a
little
pricey
im
looking
forward
to
using
this
beer
as
a
standard
to
measure
youngs
oatmeal
stout
against
all
in
all
a
great
beer
i
will
be
back
for
more
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
save
this
for
a
finisher
maybe
with
dessert
or
on
its
own
later
in
the
evening
i
dont
think
i
would
have
multiple
in
one
sitting
however
i
am
glad
that
it
is
easily
found
around
me
because
i
definitely
will
be
getting
this
again
and
again
d
very
high
great
session
or
finisher
a
must
have
for
stout
lovers
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
out
here
in
hawaii
d
this
is
super
drinkable
stout
it
has
great
flavor
to
it
a
nice
mf
and
only
5
abv
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
one
after
another
and
i
would
definitely
pick
some
up
again
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
if
not
the
best
one
that
ive
ever
had
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
smells
of
molassas
taste
is
slightly
sour
chocolaty
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
but
velvety
smooth
carbonation
levels
are
slightly
high
drinkable
this
is
easy
to
finish
the
entire
pint
bottle
a
good
ale
from
sam
smith
mouthfeel
is
smooth
good
carbonation
a
nice
stout
indeed
i
actually
got
some
beer
novices
to
appreciate
the
color
and
taste
of
this
beer
awesome
o
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
too
much
an
above
average
beer
at
best
this
is
a
good
stout
even
during
my
times
when
i
did
not
like
stouts
i
still
liked
this
one
black
in
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
you
could
certainly
taste
a
hint
of
oatmeal
and
chocolate
with
some
malts
in
the
flavor
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
finish
is
slightly
bitter
warming
with
a
chocolate
and
oatmeal
aftertaste
very
good
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
mug
it
is
as
dark
as
used
motor
oil
not
much
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
nutty
aroma
with
overtone
of
molasses
chewy
yummy
mouthfeel
spiked
by
medium
carbonation
complex
on
the
palette
unsweetened
chocolate
walnuts
hints
of
toffee
toasted
oats
and
a
lingering
coffee
finish
good
but
just
a
little
odd
like
british
cuisine
in
general
not
my
favorite
stout
or
sam
smith
offering
this
is
sweet
and
filling
this
is
like
everything
that
i
love
in
a
hot
fresh
loaf
of
oatmeal
breed
brewed
into
a
beer
of
extrodnary
flavor
and
complexity
this
is
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
this
is
as
close
to
a
purfict
5
o
as
you
can
get
this
is
top
ten
of
all
time
and
the
greatist
oatmeal
stout
i
have
ever
had
d
not
something
id
drink
anymore
than
one
of
in
a
night
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
pretty
often
yummy
stuff
this
was
the
overall
best
in
show
at
our
recent
tasting
of
11
totally
different
brews
at
my
place
among
about
a
dozen
people
who
arent
normally
beer
drinkers
outside
the
macro
stuff
but
considering
some
people
came
back
for
more
im
pleased
to
see
that
this
helped
launch
some
of
my
friends
including
my
significant
other
into
darker
beers
550
ml
bottle
makes
this
brew
very
easy
to
drink
and
equally
enjoyable
mfd
an
absolute
classic
hands
down
the
best
oatmeal
stout
out
there
you
could
drink
this
one
all
day
overall
good
choice
made
a
good
breakfast
dont
know
how
many
id
drink
in
a
row
but
id
definitely
have
one
for
breakfast
again
a
thick
wellbalanced
drink
with
minutiae
flaws
barely
worth
noting
even
a
classic
drink
it
seems
and
one
i
will
definitely
return
to
in
the
future
in
fact
the
very
near
future
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
it
does
stick
to
the
mouth
drinkability
is
out
of
this
world
and
paired
with
my
elegant
pb
and
banana
sandwich
im
pretty
sure
i
could
drink
this
one
every
morning
for
breakfast
this
is
a
mediumheavybodied
beer
with
some
sweetness
from
the
malts
to
start
followed
by
a
little
smoky
flavor
it
then
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
very
smooth
overall
a
great
beer
great
drinkability
and
very
enjoyable
a
classic
dvery
enjoyable
stout
could
only
foresee
having
one
of
these
in
a
setting
for
sure
first
experience
with
ss
and
will
be
looking
forward
to
trying
some
other
products
very
very
good
appearance
is
just
perfect
dark
dark
color
slight
amber
in
bright
light
dark
brown
creamy
head
with
lacing
on
the
side
now
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
aromas
are
roasty
and
herby
cocoa
hops
grains
potatoes
caramel
malts
its
a
menagerie
of
great
smells
taste
is
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
to
it
that
is
infectious
like
i
said
very
creamy
for
the
mouthfeel
a
perfect
light
airy
desert
overall
one
of
the
best
for
all
of
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
i
would
consider
this
no
more
than
average
in
overall
quality
i
was
so
excited
to
open
this
up
but
after
a
few
pulls
i
realized
that
although
this
is
a
good
stout
it
is
merely
average
to
me
next
time
i
will
spend
less
money
on
a
better
stout
d
this
is
a
damn
fine
stout
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
d
this
beer
iswas
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
as
some
stouts
can
be
but
certainly
not
a
light
beer
either
smooth
from
start
to
finish
as
all
good
beers
should
be
this
is
one
tasty
stout
probably
the
best
widely
available
oatmeal
overall
pretty
good
brew
though
its
not
my
favorite
style
id
reach
for
this
one
again
poured
jet
black
with
a
decent
dirty
tan
head
to
it
nose
was
a
little
roasty
chocolte
toffee
and
maybe
some
espresso
the
taste
followed
with
the
nose
it
was
rather
malty
and
much
deeper
than
previous
bottles
i
had
consumed
i
know
these
bottles
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
almost
a
year
it
tasted
quite
nice
much
maltier
thicker
and
fuller
this
beer
is
rather
thick
and
heavy
despite
the
delicious
flavor
it
would
be
difficult
to
drink
more
that
two
in
one
sitting
overall
i
really
enjoyed
thisbrew
everything
comes
together
well
in
this
brew
to
me
this
is
the
standard
for
oatmeal
stouts
and
i
highly
doubt
i
will
find
one
better
tasting
than
this
hence
the
rating
the
bottle
expires
in
nov
08
so
wasnt
out
of
date
but
wasnt
fresh
either
a
solid
offering
but
i
have
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
this
was
the
first
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
it
was
recommended
to
me
and
i
am
glad
it
was
this
was
a
great
beer
it
smelled
wonderful
tasted
awesome
and
felt
great
when
i
drank
it
as
far
as
drinkability
i
am
going
to
get
some
more
of
this
tomorrow
d
very
drinkable
enjoyable
stout
another
top
notch
offering
from
the
folks
at
ss
drinkability
is
high
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
tasted
and
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
ive
heard
about
it
overall
a
rather
good
oatmeal
stout
d
fair
due
to
heaviness
but
arent
all
stouts
also
to
note
the
bottle
when
empty
is
still
on
the
heavy
side
no
skimping
at
all
in
the
manufacturing
of
these
bad
boys
drinkability
ive
had
this
before
but
finally
got
around
to
rating
it
class
oatmeal
stout
with
few
as
good
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
many
would
think
with
a
perfect
balance
of
creaminess
and
carbonation
an
easy
choice
for
a
session
brew
when
poured
it
was
very
dark
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
which
was
also
tasted
slight
laciness
on
the
sides
not
much
in
the
smell
department
slight
fruity
smell
after
a
couple
of
tries
mouthfeel
was
good
like
a
stout
should
smooth
but
onedimensional
the
taste
was
bland
with
an
aftertaste
of
fruit
not
very
complex
the
beer
did
not
sit
very
heavy
for
a
stout
defintely
not
a
session
beer
d
a
low
abv
a
great
choice
as
a
session
beer
as
it
is
not
really
heavy
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
the
sweetness
never
becomes
cloying
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
and
interesting
and
the
feel
is
topnotch
an
excellent
pair
for
anything
sweet
or
sugary
also
a
nice
latenight
beer
could
be
sessionable
awesome
stout
highly
recommend
d
one
or
two
of
these
from
a
bottle
into
pint
glass
dark
as
night
with
about
2
inches
of
mocha
colored
head
some
head
retention
that
boils
down
to
a
small
coating
on
top
with
little
to
no
lacing
a
very
malty
nose
great
roasted
flavors
that
make
me
think
of
dark
chocolates
and
rich
coffee
id
take
this
over
any
coffee
after
dinner
or
for
breakfast
initially
very
smooth
and
velvety
then
the
carbonation
takes
over
low
carbonation
which
i
think
gives
it
a
heavier
feel
nice
crisp
bitter
finish
man
i
can
drink
this
all
day
12
oz
bottle
in
to
an
imp
pint
glass
pours
dark
bron
with
a
tan
head
that
is
holding
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
malty
smells
some
sweet
on
top
of
malty
taste
with
roast
in
the
background
the
oatmeal
creates
a
great
mouthfeel
that
is
a
little
sticky
very
easy
drinking
stout
because
of
the
great
mouthfeel
overall
very
good
surprisingly
drinkable
reccomended
i
love
this
stuff
its
delicious
smells
good
and
generally
warms
the
soul
and
takes
the
edge
off
the
day
a
benchmark
beer
d
the
only
thing
that
limits
the
drink
is
the
slightly
heavy
body
all
in
all
the
low
abv
and
great
flavors
make
this
a
pretty
solid
session
beer
funnily
enough
with
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
and
the
sweetness
of
it
compared
to
other
stouts
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
into
stout
drinking
still
a
wellcrafted
brew
that
leaves
a
lasting
impression
youll
never
forget
it
a
chewtastic
hunk
of
fruity
coffee
power
dark
brown
and
dense
with
a
substantial
cafe
au
lait
head
smells
of
oatmeal
toasty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
tastes
very
malty
theres
a
toasted
oat
flavor
both
bitter
and
sweet
it
has
a
sort
of
charred
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
rich
not
too
thick
or
acidic
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
very
flavorful
however
it
is
so
multilayered
full
and
complex
its
not
something
you
would
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
havent
enjoyed
this
offering
in
way
too
long
exceptionally
drinkable
for
such
a
heavy
stylea
classic
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
has
a
blackinsh
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
good
lacing
lots
of
black
and
roasted
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
sweet
oats
the
flavor
also
has
a
deep
and
rich
malt
profile
chocolate
and
oats
with
some
bittre
hops
to
keep
check
a
ful
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
body
goes
well
alone
or
with
a
pub
meal
great
stuff
i
paired
this
with
a
late
night
snack
of
fried
eggs
topped
with
black
pepper
and
chives
alongside
some
cracked
pepper
encrusted
bacon
lovely
combination
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
nice
ample
brown
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
like
a
stout
taste
has
oatmeal
upfront
and
finishes
with
a
coffee
aftertaste
thats
very
smooth
very
subtle
and
yet
delicious
while
not
as
strong
in
flavor
as
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
i
still
believe
this
would
make
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
oatmeal
stout
very
good
fresh
as
fresh
as
i
have
gotten
but
dont
let
it
age
in
my
book
d
fairly
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
sweet
and
malty
overall
with
a
nice
malty
chocolate
flavor
not
quite
enough
roast
in
the
aroma
any
time
a
group
of
stoutlovers
get
to
drink
sam
smiths
their
reactions
are
going
to
be
predictably
happy
ones
as
oatmeal
stouts
go
its
well
balanced
and
a
touch
on
the
heavier
side
but
filled
with
a
wonderful
rich
flavour
and
a
beautiful
brown
pour
its
clearly
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
this
beauty
pours
like
a
frothy
coffee
its
nice
and
stout
and
dont
get
me
wrong
about
the
flavor
even
for
those
nonstout
lovers
youve
gotta
get
some
of
these
even
if
youre
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
mmmm
goood
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
solid
stout
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
the
toasted
oats
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
but
definitely
worthy
of
the
occasional
visit
a
world
class
offering
from
samuel
smith
if
you
like
this
beer
and
havent
tried
the
taddy
porter
be
sure
to
give
that
a
whirl
too
d
easily
one
of
the
very
best
stouts
out
there
period
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
whenever
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
even
if
they
dont
like
stouts
great
brewery
with
an
always
satisfying
beer
the
taste
is
similar
rich
and
fullbodied
sweet
with
a
wonderfully
balancing
bitterness
it
has
qualities
of
fudge
and
raisins
the
palate
is
creamy
thick
and
silky
another
premium
beer
from
samuel
smith
brewery
enjoyed
this
one
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
bakers
chocolate
brown
nose
had
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
roasted
malts
some
faint
oats
and
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
was
thick
and
chewy
with
dark
cocoa
roasted

and
brewed
coffee
notes
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorite
dark
beers
prost
this
review
and
reviewer
doesnt
do
this
beer
justice
as
it
is
a
very
complex
and
more
importantly
a
very
very
good
beer
to
drink
stout
fan
or
not
this
is
a
must
try
excellent
beer
a
prime
example
of
the
style
if
a
new
beer
drinker
would
want
to
try
a
stout
give
them
this
drinkability
high
however
it
is
a
stout
after
all
and
so
is
quite
filling
i
have
no
problem
drinking
three
or
four
of
these
in
a
row
though
so
if
your
stomach
can
handle
all
the
epic
beer
its
receiving
your
mouth
will
certainly
be
able
to
savor
more
than
one
of
these
mighty
stouts
in
a
sitting
notes
simply
one
of
the
greatest
tasting
brews
i
have
ever
had
and
until
now
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
for
some
reason
please
pick
up
some
and
treat
yourself
to
one
of
the
finest
crafted
beers
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
easy
drinkability
could
have
34
of
these
for
sure
overall
as
long
as
you
get
a
fresh
bottle
a
great
choice
for
dinner
with
a
burger
or
fish
or
whatever
you
like
not
overpowering
like
most
stouts
just
right
the
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
in
dim
light
maybe
mistaken
for
black
it
has
a
wonderful
smell
of
rich
chocolate
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
taste
stays
very
well
in
your
mouth
and
almost
has
a
warming
sensation
and
finishes
extremly
clean
this
is
definaly
a
beer
i
could
keep
around
to
drink
on
occasion
when
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
d
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
too
bad
its
so
expensive
i
always
keep
a
look
out
for
it
going
on
sale
very
easy
to
drink
easy
to
session
and
still
quite
tasty
ive
passed
over
this
beer
countless
times
in
beer
stores
and
now
i
wonder
why
sammy
smiths
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
deep
deep
black
with
good
fluffy
off
white
head
lace
in
nice
the
nose
is
the
weakest
part
of
the
beer
with
some
malt
smokiness
and
a
coppery
smell
taste
is
defenitely
the
strongsuit
here
and
is
immediately
a
roasted
malt
flavor
that
is
huge
with
great
smokiness
and
a
wonderful
burnt
meatiness
that
sits
well
through
the
middle
the
finish
has
some
hops
but
not
enough
to
be
bitter
very
silky
mouthfeel
through
the
middle
but
still
good
carbonation
a
grainy
feel
towards
the
finish
detracts
a
little
bit
aftertaste
lingers
smoke
drinkability
is
superb
as
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
for
5
without
feeling
abrasive
or
too
soupy
overall
a
fantastic
brew
by
sam
smiths
defenitely
one
of
my
favorite
cabin
brews
i
would
love
to
clone
this
someday
great
beer
d
very
drinkable
but
probably
limited
to
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
its
very
filling
like
drinking
a
loaf
of
very
tasty
bread
dark
brown
color
carefully
poured
produced
a
light
brown
foamy
head
at
about
12
of
depth
and
left
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
yields
some
nice
but
faint
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
coffee
and
some
additional
aromas
of
lighter
malts
the
taste
is
this
brews
strong
point
an
even
mouthfeel
slightly
chewy
and
very
creamy
and
a
complex
mix
of
malty
goodness
combine
well
with
the
relatively
light
carbonation
all
add
up
to
an
excellent
experience
samuel
smiths
typically
produces
high
quality
brews
and
this
is
no
exception
very
good
d
a
very
drinkable
stout
due
to
the
smoothness
and
low
abv
d
nice
complexity
and
very
easy
to
drink
could
have
pint
upon
pint
upon
pint
of
this
stuff
an
allaround
superb
brew
d
full
of
pure
natural
flavor
one
of
the
things
that
appeals
to
me
most
about
sam
smith
is
the
taste
of
the
water
i
wish
i
could
get
it
by
the
gallon
all
their
beers
seem
so
classy
and
traditional
and
are
entirely
drinkable
this
oatmeal
is
no
different
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
after
just
having
one
of
these
and
ill
definitely
be
heading
back
for
more
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
lovers
stout
i
was
very
impressed
and
i
believe
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
at
least
t
very
well
balanced
this
beer
opens
with
the
roasted
malt
and
the
mild
cocoa
and
coffee
and
oatmeal
sweetness
in
perfect
harmony
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
big
enough
to
hold
the
flavors
together
while
light
enough
to
be
truly
refreshing
mildly
bitter
on
the
finish
with
flavors
of
oatmeal
chocolate
and
raisins
lingering
this
is
smooth
on
the
palate
with
light
carbonation
a
touch
metallic
on
the
finish
iron
this
is
the
only
flaw
i
can
point
to
here
the
oatmeal
does
take
the
edge
off
the
roasted
malt
bitterness
i
could
drink
an
awful
lot
of
this
very
nice
beer
d
pretty
heavy
beer
pretty
much
a
meal
in
18oz
form
but
a
very
good
meal
nonetheless
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
if
they
werent
3
50
a
bottle
id
like
to
tip
more
than
one
back
any
day
of
the
week
very
good
beer
d
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
will
definitely
enjoy
it
again
a
really
good
oatmeal
stout
poured
from
a
335ml
bottle
into
an
allagash
witbier
glass
the
beer
appears
to
be
dark
drown
in
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
the
aroma
hints
of
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
the
beer
tastes
with
hints
of
caramel
chocolate
nuts
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
moderately
carbonated
beer
and
is
easily
drinkable
the
beer
carries
no
lacing
down
the
glass
and
there
is
a
strong
after
taste
of
roasted
nuts
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
short
tan
head
that
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
down
it
had
a
very
nice
malty
and
oatmealy
aroma
followed
by
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
has
alot
of
deep
roasted
malt
that
is
followed
by
hints
of
chocoalte
caramel
and
some
rich
oatmeal
flavor
that
was
actually
pretty
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
as
it
was
a
very
smooth
and
velvety
and
warming
beer
the
drinkability
is
good
as
i
would
definately
have
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
o
it
was
thoroughly
drinkable
this
was
my
first
oatmeal
stout
quite
a
good
introduction
to
the
genre
md
average
mouthfeel
not
watery
and
not
thick
didnt
dry
out
the
mouth
is
not
the
best
drinkable
beer
a
decent
session
beer
though
reddish
brown
in
color
thick
tan
head
that
retains
itself
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
very
very
roasty
with
notes
of
coffee
and
nuts
theres
also
some
sweet
chocolate
taste
is
similarly
roasty
lots
of
coffee
with
a
little
fruitiness
very
maltdominated
and
chewy
hard
to
tell
if
the
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
from
hops
or
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
extremely
creamy
and
velvety
but
with
enough
warmth
becomes
a
bit
watery
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
and
one
of
sss
best
beers
easy
to
drink
good
thing
the
abv
is
5
otherwise
you
could
get
into
big
trouble
with
this
one
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
a
long
long
time
great
looking
its
dark
brown
with
a
strong
offwhite
head
subtle
aromas
of
chocolate
and
oatmeal
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
consistent
with
the
aroma
only
more
definite
sweet
aftertaste
is
pleasant
not
overpowering
this
beer
has
texture
unlike
anything
else
very
smooth
rich
and
creamy
a
most
agreeable
drinking
experience
serving
type
bottle
bottle
pours
with
a
nice
tan
creamy
head
and
a
black
body
fine
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
the
flavour
is
rather
sweet
with
a
taste
of
dark
malt
notes
of
black
coffee
and
chocolate
medium
to
full
bodied
smooth
and
light
bitter
finish
a
top
beer
in
this
style
and
very
enjoyable
too
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
large
fluffy
mocha
head
sticks
around
forever
and
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smells
of
molasses
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
filled
with
caramel
molasses
chocolate
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
finishes
kind
of
dry
with
a
lingering
subtle
roast
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
just
short
of
creamy
medium
body
and
carbonation
i
actually
think
i
like
this
a
bit
less
than
the
first
time
i
reviewed
this
its
a
decent
enough
beer
but
nothing
special
maybe
i
just
enjoy
the
less
subtle
american
version
of
everything
my
score
reflects
the
first
time
i
tried
this
i
could
drink
these
all
day
without
a
problem
overall
this
beer
was
excellent
i
prefer
the
belgian
style
ales
but
this
stuff
was
damn
good
thumbs
up
d
one
to
enjoy
quite
expensive
for
this
four
pack
of
victorian
bottles
but
i
should
say
well
worth
it
d
fantastic
rich
brew
that
would
go
dowm
great
anytime
hv
poured
almost
black
from
bottle
but
head
didnt
last
too
long
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
ground
aroma
litle
thin
in
the
body
but
i
was
comparing
it
with
another
stout
on
tap
poured
through
a
creamer
easy
to
drink
no
lingering
malt
bitterness
i
definatley
recommend
that
every
stout
fan
try
at
least
one
of
these
d
this
one
will
be
drank
quickly
must
check
out
their
other
beers
very
pleasantly
surprised
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
is
a
great
beer
i
only
buy
it
a
couple
time
per
year
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
benchmark
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
oatmeal
stout
for
anytime
d
very
drinkable
stout
this
stuff
certaily
suited
my
enviornment
at
the
time
i
enjoyed
the
blance
and
sweetness
of
the
stout
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
if
youre
into
stouts
it
has
a
great
complex
taste
like
most
stouts
though
it
does
weigh
you
down
after
awhile
me
happy
i
bought
a
four
pack
to
try
and
it
was
gone
fast
i
definitely
will
be
buying
more
d
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
not
too
dry
or
too
bitter
nice
blend
of
flavors
no
single
flavor
or
aroma
overpowers
in
this
brew
very
robust
and
flavorful
drinkability
a
very
good
stout
very
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
d
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
10
or
12
of
these
in
one
night
all
though
i
sure
am
willing
and
wanting
to
try
but
this
was
delicious
a
meal
in
a
glass
just
5
abv
i
wish
i
had
another
d
one
of
the
first
oatmeal
stouts
i
ever
drank
years
ago
definitely
still
one
of
my
favorites
easily
drinkable
for
someone
looking
for
something
in
between
a
dry
irish
stout
and
a
sweet
chocolate
stout
black
with
a
good
tan
head
atop
smell
is
slightly
sweet
and
hearty
oatiness
light
sweet
almost
caramel
like
flavor
with
oat
and
high
carbonation
from
the
bottle
initially
but
which
reduced
drastically
after
sitting
out
for
15
minutes
a
really
flavorful
smooth
easy
to
drink
oatmeal
stout
with
more
umph
to
it
that
youngs
milder
flavored
version
of
the
oatmeal
stout
pretty
drinkable
beer
tasty
with
a
great
feel
d
i
love
these
i
could
drink
them
slowly
all
evening
this
wasnt
as
thick
and
full
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
but
rather
smooth
and
easygoing
i
would
definitely
look
to
try
more
of
this
and
recommend
it
to
others
d
really
simple
but
very
wellbalanced
a
solid
beer
what
to
expect
from
sammy
smith
the
mouthfeel
does
much
to
make
this
perfectly
drinkable
holding
the
carbonation
in
delicate
balance
with
the
fairly
sweet
smooth
creamy
texture
i
find
that
i
rarely
have
two
of
these
backtoback
usually
buying
just
one
at
a
time
to
savor
yet
enjoying
two
or
three
of
these
in
succession
would
be
a
cinch
its
the
easiest
stout
to
drink
there
is
malted
milk
masquerading
as
stout
a
gem
very
filling
a
meal
in
a
bottle
drinkability
very
good
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
is
very
balanced
and
very
smooth
definitely
a
good
traditional
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
finally
give
this
beer
a
try
the
packaging
just
didnt
look
appealing
the
beer
started
off
great
but
the
more
i
had
the
less
enamored
i
became
one
of
these
is
enough
to
satisfy
my
appetite
i
like
the
low
abv
but
a
full
bodied
beer
like
this
would
match
up
better
with
more
alcohol
since
you
wont
be
drinking
much
of
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
in
the
world
and
worthy
of
tasting
in
a
flight
of
the
worlds
best
this
is
a
great
beer
especially
for
the
winter
i
imagine
myself
at
a
british
pub
enjoying
this
tastes
like
a
classic
english
beer
very
heavy
its
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
exceptionally
drinkable
after
a
disappointing
experience
with
ss
taddy
porter
the
oatmeal
stout
is
a
welcome
followup
i
cant
wait
to
find
some
more
bottles
of
this
pours
a
deep
amber
black
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
oatmeal
and
a
roasty
maltiness
in
the
taste
just
like
the
aroma
sweet
oatmeal
and
a
roasty
malt
a
small
bite
and
a
decently
big
roasty
maltiness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
one
of
the
beers
that
changed
me
into
what
i
am
today
however
thank
god
for
the
brown
bottles
finally
d
easy
drinker
quite
robust
the
lighter
abv
consistency
makes
it
a
sure
second
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
half
inch
frothy
head
smells
sweet
with
roasted
malt
aromas
with
a
hint
of
some
fruit
aroma
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
is
surprisingly
carbonated
and
theres
a
little
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
taste
is
that
of
roasted
malts
and
too
complex
but
still
pleasing
this
is
a
slightly
about
average
oatmeal
stout
if
you
were
to
use
an
oatmeal
stout
as
a
session
bear
this
would
be
the
one
notes
not
my
favorite
but
i
had
different
expectations
for
the
style
ok
beer
d
highly
enjoyable
1
20oz
bottle
was
just
perfect
for
a
nightcap
not
a
session
beer
but
definitely
worth
revisiting
highly
recommended
poured
this
from
a
brown
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
trademark
gold
foil
pitch
black
with
tinges
of
ruby
where
very
little
light
shines
through
twofinger
khaki
head
that
takes
a
while
to
get
settled
down
solid
lacing
smell
is
both
sweet
and
roasted
toffee
caramel
coffee
oats
very
well
done
quite
complex
and
a
joy
to
breathe
in
taste
is
good
but
it
isnt
nearly
up
to
par
with
the
delicious
smell
a
bit
acidic
in
character
slightly
sour
towards
the
end
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
not
bad
at
all
my
first
experience
in
the
genre
of
oatmeal
stout
i
must
try
others
d
low
alcohol
makes
it
drinkable
but
it
isnt
my
taste
to
have
more
than
one
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
pours
black
with
a
generous
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
combination
of
sweetness
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
the
above
listed
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
coating
with
light
carbonation
a
pleasant
aftertaste
of
coffee
and
a
tinge
of
alcohol
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
pours
very
dark
with
a
thin
tan
head
nice
even
lacing
all
the
way
down
that
lightly
coats
the
sides
of
your
glass
with
a
fine
oily
film
pleasant
chocolaty
smell
tastes
of
chocolate
oats
light
coffee
lightly
carbonated
this
is
about
as
perfect
as
a
stout
can
get
which
is
no
surprise
considering
the
perfect
imperial
stout
made
they
also
brew
d
this
is
an
outstanding
oatmeal
stout
and
one
i
keep
on
hand
at
all
times
its
thick
and
delicious
with
an
outstanding
drinkability
poured
from
bottle
into
chalice
pours
jet
black
with
offwhite
head
not
too
thick
and
moderate
retention
smell
is
muted
but
has
a
nutty
and
cocoa
scent
to
it
taste
is
good
tastes
of
choclate
toasted
grains
some
dark
malt
extremly
creamy
both
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
its
hard
to
describe
but
there
is
an
overall
creamy
aspect
to
the
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
low
abv
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
that
left
a
great
overall
impression
overall
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
the
taste
is
almost
so
complex
as
to
be
indescribable
i
think
it
would
pair
nicely
with
a
cheesecake
or
white
meat
dish
d
i
thinks
this
is
a
good
stout
i
expected
a
little
more
from
the
hype
on
this
site
its
worth
a
try
a
really
good
oatmeal
stout
the
only
better
ive
had
was
a
homebrew
with
fresh
oats
its
easy
to
find
in
stores
its
only
a
few
bucks
comes
in
18oz
and
is
very
tasty
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
nice
red
hue
when
held
up
to
light
thin
tan
headwith
decent
retentionand
a
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
roastednutty
malts
body
was
thiner
than
i
expectedwith
a
bit
of
carbonation
taste
is
of
roasted
oats
and
sweet
malts
very
smoothand
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
awesome
i
really
doubt
a
better
oatmeal
stout
exists
it
comes
in
a
tight
bottle
with
foil
and
class
all
over
it
it
pours
dark
brown
and
smells
like
nuts
and
malts
the
taste
is
awesome
and
has
a
little
bit
of
coffee
with
some
nuts
and
a
ton
of
oats
i
feel
like
a
horse
the
feel
is
awesome
and
for
a
decently
thick
stout
it
goes
down
smooth
as
hell
im
down
with
the
carbonation
as
well
great
times
overall
im
pleased
with
my
first
oatmeal
stout
experience
and
will
seek
out
others
for
comparison
on
its
own
it
seemed
to
be
wellcrafted
and
tasty
as
a
stout
since
the
taste
is
not
explosive
its
wellserved
as
a
good
starter
stout
for
newbies
poured
into
my
lake
louie
pint
glass
a
nice
dark
stout
with
lots
of
carbonation
sprigs
rising
to
a
browning
head
a
nice
sight
when
making
dinner
tonight
the
scent
of
sweet
roasted
malt
was
most
present
the
taste
followed
as
well
with
only
a
bit
of
bitterness
it
went
down
sweet
and
wet
with
a
medium
body
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
thin
this
is
a
nice
switch
from
the
stout
of
a
guiness
this
is
also
a
bit
more
sweet
and
malty
than
grays
ive
not
tried
other
stouts
of
this
type
but
ill
definitely
keep
at
least
one
of
these
55ozs
around
i
will
have
to
compare
this
to
youngs
as
well
overall
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
not
the
best
stout
out
there
but
very
worthy
im
certainly
glad
i
bought
a
sixpack
its
amazing
that
this
beer
kick
started
the
new
oatmeal
stout
trends
because
theres
little
room
for
improvement
here
it
finishes
like
silk
and
is
easy
to
drink
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
this
has
a
great
flavor
and
drinkability
but
it
is
almost
to
sweet
for
me
i
still
enjoyed
this
though
and
a
beer
i
would
recommend
the
definition
of
an
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
was
ok
it
seems
like
a
pretty
heavy
beer
so
that
slowed
me
down
although
it
went
down
smooth
mix
that
with
a
heavy
dinner
and
youll
get
full
quick
and
not
be
able
to
enjoy
much
more
of
this
tasty
beer
d
this
is
a
good
heavy
stout
it
is
very
drinkable
and
one
that
you
could
drink
all
night
d
i
love
it
its
cheap
ill
drink
it
all
the
time
d
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
i
cant
believe
that
i
waited
this
long
to
try
it
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
often
in
small
quantities
one
or
two
per
session
would
suffice
for
me
all
around
on
e
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
yet
d
this
is
a
fine
stout
i
would
happily
sit
down
for
another
of
these
and
would
be
happy
to
drink
them
all
night
as
well
lastly
maybe
im
lucky
but
ive
never
had
a
problem
with
skunked
samuel
smith
beers
in
their
dark
brown
bottles
covered
with
foil
tops
and
packaged
in
cardboard
moreys
bottom
line
samuel
smiths
beers
came
highly
recommend
from
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
their
oatmeal
stout
and
nut
brown
set
the
standard
for
their
styles
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
stout
nice
work
great
session
beer
bottle
smell
is
of
sweet
malty
molasses
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
pours
to
a
brown
motor
oil
that
lets
no
light
through
head
is
dark
tan
taste
is
very
notably
malty
with
a
prevalence
of
oatmeal
and
semi
sweet
chocolate
with
a
slight
but
not
overly
roasted
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
sufficient
but
not
too
much
carbonation
not
much
hops
at
all
detectable
this
is
a
very
sweet
brew
for
my
taste
is
needs
some
bitter
hops
for
balance
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
and
would
go
good
with
or
on
top
of
vanilla
ice
cream
in
my
opinion
i
have
to
rate
lower
on
drinkability
due
to
the
lack
of
balance
and
excessive
sweetness
one
of
these
is
sweet
enough
d
goes
down
smooth
but
too
heavy
in
the
stomach
to
have
more
than
one
550
ml
in
a
sitting
higher
abv
would
be
a
nice
complement
to
the
flavor
experienced
here
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
quite
sweet
coming
from
the
roasted
aspects
of
the
beer
with
chocolate
being
more
evident
than
from
the
smell
the
sweetness
stays
with
you
long
after
drinking
still
surprisingly
drinkable
hasnt
gone
too
far
yet
creamy
yet
slightly
dry
light
in
body
yet
rich
in
taste
although
certainly
not
to
the
level
of
bigger
badder
assed
stouts
even
while
passed
its
prime
this
stout
still
demonstrates
its
quality
do
not
cellar
this
beer
for
any
significant
period
of
time
respect
it
and
enjoy
immediately
considering
the
color
and
smell
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
and
a
thicker
feel
however
this
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
drink
compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
drinkability
is
the
only
thing
that
didnt
stand
out
as
much
as
other
attributes
however
its
a
really
good
beer
and
served
as
a
good
starting
point
for
trying
oatmeal
stouts
drinkability
is
ok
but
that
classic
sammy
smiths
tang
is
just
too
much
and
this
generally
drinks
much
stronger
then
only
5
abv
would
make
a
fantastic
cologne
though
whats
the
old
adage
that
you
can
never
be
too
rich
or
too
smooth
this
one
definitely
falls
into
the
rich
and
smooth
category
as
oatmeal
stouts
go
they
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
like
sss
other
beers
however
this
one
takes
a
lot
of
taste
and
packs
it
into
a
very
drinkable
package
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
disappeared
quickly
but
left
a
nice
tan
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
all
malt
dark
toasted
grain
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
starts
with
the
same
dark
roast
taste
but
balances
nicely
no
change
as
the
glass
warms
and
no
perceptible
alcohol
taste
very
nice
and
the
best
part
is
that
you
could
enjoy
more
than
one
in
an
evening
excellent
d
very
nice
indeedy
laddy
blokes
learned
by
spying
on
the
emerald
isle
to
the
west
aye
drink
up
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
these
all
day
due
to
the
rich
body
yet
surprisingly
smooth
and
light
finish
exceptional
for
the
style
great
beer
my
second
sample
from
the
samuel
smith
company
and
i
am
even
more
impressed
with
this
brew
than
i
was
with
the
winter
warmer
which
was
also
great
this
beer
pours
a
dark
opaque
color
almost
completely
black
with
a
nice
frothy
head
the
smell
is
of
burnt
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
a
nice
sweet
aroma
with
an
even
more
appealing
creamy
cocoa
taste
that
is
not
at
all
bitter
the
flavor
is
excellent
for
a
stout
goes
down
crisp
and
smooth
with
no
traces
of
bitterness
whatsoever
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
that
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
mouthfeel
is
equally
great
and
i
really
enjoyed
downing
an
18
ounce
size
definitely
worth
a
try
and
certainly
recommended
pours
pitch
black
with
hints
of
brown

the
glass
is
narrow
enough
to
let
light
through
cream
coffee
colored
head
foam
settles
down
to
stable
lace
across
the
surface
smells
sweet
oatmeal
chocolate
and
smoked

tastes
mmm
thick
oatmeal
goodness
mouthfeel
is
perfect
the
carbonation
lends
supporting
creaminess
to
the
body
and
doesnt
get
in
the
way
good
sessionactivity
beer
for
shoveling
snow
muching
on
olives
and
strong
cheese
or
sipping
slowly
in
a
old
lazyboy
recliner
near
the
fireplace
interesting
flavor
very
drinkable
for
such
a
heavy
beer
my
favorite
tadcaster
brew
thus
far
im
quite
impressed
with
this
one
d
see
taste
and
mouthfeel
basically
this
beer
runs
short
of
the
smell
and
my
expectations
still
a
pretty
good
beer
d
there
would
be
almost
no
reason
for
me
not
to
have
another
of
these
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
cramy
and
not
too
sweet
cool
looking
skinny
bottle
pours
black
with
the
slightest
hint
of
amber
has
a
finger
and
half
rocky
tan
head
that
died
down
quickly
smells
like
toffee
and
hops
tastes
like
it
smells
with
an
aftertaste
of
coffee
and
a
slight
metallic
taste
a
little
over
carbonatedim
not
big
on
carbonation
with
a
fizzy
mouthfeel
thats
slightly
sticky
very
drinkable
beer
especially
when
its
cold
outside
pretty
filling
and
overall
id
say
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
this
is
what
stout
is
all
about
baby
very
creamy
full
of
body
and
robust
in
flavor
it
has
a
darkasnight
look
and
a
frothy
head
that
lingers
and
lingers
it
has
a
chocoiatecoffee
aftertaste
that
will
leave
you
wanting
another
sip
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
brew
from
samuel
smith
to
drink
quickly
then
it
will
be
gone
overall
this
beer
is
a
must
have
if
you
enjoy
stouts
if
you
are
new
to
oatmeal
stouts
and
want
to
try
one
this
is
one
you
definitely
must
try
extremely
drinkable
i
could
finish
the
4pack
right
now
d
not
bad
better
than
guiness
which
isnt
exactly
the
standard
so
you
have
no
excuse
for
having
never
tried
itdeus1138nov

it
was
very
easy
to
drink
the
whole
thing
so
this
is
good
i
recommend
this
beer

and
it
always
leaves
a
sour
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
once
the
beer
is
gone
not
a
big
deal
if
youre
having
another
this
is
an
outstanding
stout
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
very
easy
to
down
several
of
these
in

sitting
this
could
be

stout
pours
a
black
with

smelled

tasted
of

chocolate
and

no
alcohol
and
a

very
smooth

mouth
but
a
little
watery
very
drinkable
wanted
to
kill
of
two
or
three
at
one
time
but
decided
against
it
this
beer
pours
an
almost
opaque
dark
brown
with
ruby
accents

a
good
rich
thick
head
with
no

with
the

with

excellent
mouthfeel
big
and
creamy
moderate
hops
lend
to
a
dry
finish
that
is
quite
quick
and
clean
for
a
stout
all
said
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
oatmeal
stout
completely

slight

with
an
intoxicating
smell
very
deep
tofee
chocolate
smell
with
an
almost
coniac
scent
mixed
in
maybe
its
just
me
a
great
beer
from
an
old
brewery
what
would
you
expect
pours
black
with
some
burnt
orange
highlights
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
smells
sweet
and
creamy
with
vanilla
and
slightly
roasty
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
smooth
creamy
lightly
roasted
maltiness
that
is
very
smooth
and
has
notes
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
sherry
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
sour
finish
from
the
grain
quite
drinkable
with
its
low
abv
and
tasty
creaminess
this
one
is
a
quaffer
quite
full
bodied
with
a
velvety
smooth
feel
this
one
would
make
a
terrific
night
cap
or
dessert
beer
if
you
will
a
style
i
love
and
a
brewery
i
want
to
enjoy
but
for
english
oatmeal
stouts
im
sticking
with
youngs
this
one
keeps
me
batting
close
to
000
on
samuel
smith
in
bottles
theres
something
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
with
this
beer
when
compared
to
other
stouts
but
it
is
good
it
has
a
somewhat
cool
and
subdued
flavor
but
it
works
well
not
an
everyday
type
of
beer
but
one
that
ill
surely
have
again
d
the
best
stout
ive
had
since
i
started
keeping
track
i
read
this
this
is
samuel
smiths
flagship
and
it
makes
sense
why
its
got
great
flavor
but
is
light
enough
for
you
to
keep
coming
back
for
more
notes
this
is
a
great
stout
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
i
know
this
review
doesnt
do
the
beer
justice
it
is
complex
interesting
but
also
flat
out
enjoyable
the
benchmark
for
the
style
with
this
and
other
ss
beers
my
advice
is
only
by
at
high
volume
beer
specialty
stores
otherwise
you
could
get
a
stale
bottle
which
leads
to
less
carb
and
more
wineyness
and
a
hangover
so
be
careful
freshness
is
important
with
this
choice
pours
a
big
forhty
head
that
doesnt
fall
very
fast
and
leaves
a
great
lacing
behind
the
color
is
black
a
looks
very
smooth
the
smell
is
coffee
and
a
big
chocolately
taste
that
is
very
nice
the
taste
is
even
smoother
with
a
big
sweetcoffee
taste
its
very
smooth
and
velvetty
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
would
have
some
more
like
a
hug
in
a
bottle
complex
taste
centered
around
creamy
darkness
definitely
not
bad
this
one
poured
as
near
black
as
you
can
get
with
a
modest
tan
head
that
left
some
spot
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
faint
but
has
a
coffee
syrup
aroma
the
taste
of
the
oatmeal
stout
is
not
as
pronounced
as
smiths
imperial
it
has
a
subtle
roasted
flavor
bit
semisweet
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
as
smooth
as
it
gets
velvety
this
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
stout
that
i
have
had
it
is
very
balanced
and
smooth
a
tad
bitter
a
tad
sweet
i
very
much
like
this
style
however
the
taste
doesnt
blow
me
away
taste
is
roasted
and
burned
with
that
oiliness
from
the
oatmeal
a
good
maltbitter
and
hopbitter
balances
the
dark
taste
there
are
some
smokey
elements
and
the
yeast
gives
the
beer
its
distinct
profile
which
is
hard
to
describe
but
if
i
do
it
would
be
earthy
and
charcoal
body
is
medium
and
yes
this
stuff
is
mild
and
highly
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
drinakbility
4
ah
the
taste
of
england
im
not
fond
of
the
traditional
rubbery
diacetylsoaked
english
ale
but
this
is
a
nice
little
awkward
beer
if
i
had
to
drink
english
it
would
be
sam
smith
although
i
prefer
some
of
their
other
beers
the
impy
stout
is
much
much
better
final
statement
lived
up
to
the
hype
the
jury
is
out
on
which
is
better
this
or
st
ambroise
but
sam
smiths
put
together
a
real
winner
here
i
only
wish
it
were
available
here
on
a
regular
basis
pours
dark
black
if
there
is
such
a
color
big
creamy
beige
head
holds
very
well
beautiful
in
my
pint
glass
i
dont
know
why
but
dark
beers
just
look
more
like
beer
should
to
me
smells
sweet
slightly
sugary
with
some
coffee
undertones
not
too
much
on
the
nose
but
enough
to
be
enticing
tastes
excellent
semisweet
chocolate
coffee
very
nutty
and
earthy
leaves
me
with
a
good
memory
of
every
last
sip
highly
drinkable
as
far
as
stouts
go
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinkability
very
nice
probably
the
brest
massproduced
oatmeal
stout
in
the
world
reminds
me
of
a
parking
lot
in
a
time
long
ago
this
beer
drinks
sweet
and
smooth
even
after
all
this
time
still
a
world
class
stout
i
loved
this
beer
i
may
be
willing
to
say
this
could
now
be
my
favorite
as
of
right
now
i
will
be
keeping
a
few
pints
of
this
on
hand
at
all
times
for
any
and
all
occassions
i
even
got
my
dad
to
give
it
a
try
and
he
isnt
much
for
stouts
and
he
says
that
its
one
of
the
most
flavorful
and
delicious
beers
hes
ever
tasted
drinkability
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
drinkable
i
love
it
overall
glad
to
find
that
three
years
after
my
first
negative
review
this
beer
is
what
i
remember
smokey
creamy
and
flavorful
without
being
overpowering
this
is
a
beer
worth
saving
for
special
occasions
because
it
has
such
a
splendid
flavor
i
recommend
this
oatmeal
stout
to
all
connoisseurs
of
stouts
and
porters
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
huge
frothy
beige
head
that
stood
two
fingers
high
at
its
peak
slowly
falls
away
to
moderate
glasscoating
lace
and
a
thin
coat
of
film
on
top
smells
are
roasted
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
notes
also
a
slight
earthen
grainy
character
present
taste
is
sweet
and
roasty
chocolate
and
espresso
flavors
abound
finishes
on
a
slightly
bitter
roasty
flavor
with
a
dry
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
medium
to
full
bodied
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
makes
this
one
just
silkensmooth
drinkability
is
also
great
very
enjoyable
stout
characteristics
and
roasty
complexity
coupled
with
the
low
abv
make
this
an
easy
to
enjoy
oatmeal
stout
highly
recommend
and
will
seek
out
again
poured
the
large
bottle
to
an
oversized
pint
glass
pours
black
with
a
very
small
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
light
does
come
through
not
pitch
black
smells
of
oatmeal
cookies
and
molasses
tastes
somewhat
sweet
with
good
molasses
hints
and
some
coffee
and
bitter
tones
goes
down
very
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
all
of
a
sudden
very
good
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
pours
very
dark
black
but
not
completely
opaque
when
it
is
held
up
to
a
light
the
head
is
dark
tan
and
is
thin
to
begin
with
and
doesnt
lace
much
the
smell
is
chocolate
malt
dark
fruit
molasses
and
oatmeal
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
acidity
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
a
plesent
coating
feeling
the
beer
fills
the
mouth
well
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
something
you
could
have
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
with
feeling
bogged
down
or
overwhelmed
or
something
that
you
could
have
every
day
without
getting
tired
of
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
layer
of
foam
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
leaving
very
little
lacing
smells
a
bit
skunky
with
some
burnt
malt
hope
i
didnt
get
the
clear
bottle
blues
taste
of
oatmeal
and
a
burnt
malt
and
hop
bitterness
feels
lightmedium
and
a
little
creamy
in
the
mouth
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
times
and
i
remember
it
tasting
a
lot
more
richer
and
creamier
i
think
this
one
might
be
a
little
light
damaged
and
ill
try
it
again
and
adjust
my
review
in
the
near
future
a
very
delicious
and
well
balanced
stout
what
i
liked
most
is
that
the
aftertaste
didnt
completely
pollute
my
mouth
after
a
bottle
of
this
beer
beer
is
extremely
dark
almost
black
when
held
to
light
shades
of
crimson
shine
through
while
the
head
is
a
thick
coffee
color
smell
is
extremely
complex
with
the
expected
oatmeal
yeast
and
even
a
coffelike
aroma
shining
through
taste
is
the
same
strong
and
bitter
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
amazing
goes
down
extremely
smooth
for
such
a
heavy
beer
drinkability
is
likewise
surprisingly
high
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
one
and
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
d
if
i
was
a
millionaire
my
fridge
would
always
be
filled
with
samual
smith
oatmeal
stout
it
is
great
as
a
session
beer
or
for
just
sitting
back
and
enjoying
its
many
complexities
this
beer
defines
the
style
of
oatmeal
stout
and
deserves
all
of
the
respect
it
is
given
some
definite
acidity
and
more
of
a
carbonation
bite
more
of
a
bittering
roastiness
picked
up
here
but
still
quite
smooth
d
very
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
has
a
rich
and
smooth
tight
bubbled
head
that
nicely
laces
the
glass
as
it
recedes
a
cocoa
or
coffee
smell
hits
you
first
when
you
go
to
take
a
sip
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
notes
of
roast
has
a
slight
sweetness
at
the
beginning
finishes
wet
with
a
burnt
aftertaste
this
550ml
bottle
will
be
consumed
quickly
as
it
goes
down
soooo
smooth
would
definitely
recommend
cheers
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
that
is
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
that
goes
away
but
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
a
very
interesting
aroma
hard
to
really
pinpoint
what
is
really
there
its
a
earthy
sweet
smell
some
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
the
taste
is
good
smooth
in
the
front
with
a
building
sweetness
that
ends
with
some
chocolate
bitterness
and
spice
in
the
finish
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
another
great
offering
from
samuel
smiths
there
are
many
stouts
and
oatmeal
stouts
about
but
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
the
aroma
the
taste
the
color
it
just
seems
perfect
i
like
to
chill
this
beer
just
slightly
then
pout
it
into
a
nice
thick
beer
mug
i
could
be
happy
with
this
beer
if
it
was
the
only
one
available
forever
more
i
love
it
starchy
but
sweet
full
of
flavor
goes
down
easily
start
to
finish
while
remaining
very
complex
i
cant
place
some
of
the
flavor
and
hearty
perfect
to
augment
the
paltry
13
degrees
im
working
with
tonight
another
reason
to
celebrate
the
old
brewery
overall
a
superior
different
and
tasty
stout
highly
recommended
especially
for
the
holidays
cheers
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
lingers
well
great
smell
with
hints
of
molasses
with
chocolate
taste
is
fantastic
so
smooth
and
well
balanced
there
is
little
to
complain
about
here
possibly
the
best
oatmeal
stout
around
ive
had
this
case
for
a
while
and
it
just
seems
to
get
better
this
is
a
great
beer
so
full
and
smooth
great
dark
color
with
light
tan
head
nice
sweet
roasted
flavor
feels
so
full
and
tasty
in
my
mouth
but
goes
down
so
nice
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
i
had
the
money
why
cant
cheap
beer
taste
like
this
dark
brown
color
with
little
head
aromas
are
malty
with
a
little
smoke
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
flavors
are
somewhat
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
i
cant
detect
the
oat
influence
but
perhaps
that
manifests
itself
as
sweetness
great
sweet
finish
very
pleasant
very
drinkable
and
smileinducing
stout
this
beer
will
be
in
my
home
for
the
holidays
for
sure
this
is
the
most
sessionable
oatmeal
sout
ive
ever
had
try
this
beer
d
hands
down
a
great
oatmeal
stout
from
olde
england
definitely
a
necessary
purchase
during
the
winter
months
i
love
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
for
what
it
is
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
i
might
have
killed
the
head
by
pouring
to
cold
but
there
just
isnt
anything
there
to
speak
of
smell
of
cherries
and
plums
gives
it
a
real
fruitiness
milky
smooth
chocolate
flavors
appear
in
the
taste
and
it
finishes
with
a
butterscotch
note
ive
been
really
turned
off
by
butterscotch
flavors
in
beer
previously
but
this
is
just
the
right
amount
to
not
be
overpowering
some
bitter
bakers
chocolate
notes
also
come
through
very
smooth
beer
with
lots
of
interesting
flavors
totally
enjoyable
and
deserving
of
the
good
reputation
drinkability
for
anyone
a
fan
of
stout
beer
this
is
a
must
try
im
so
happy
my
beer
store
now
carrys
samuel
smith
drinkability
the
most
overrated
beer
on
this
website
and
perhaps
the
world
this
posesses
all
the
bad
qualities
of
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
urbock
but
lacks
the
charm
ehh
i
bought
a
12
ounze
bottle
from
michaels
deli
in
king
of
prussia
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
sound
it
made
when
it
poured
made
you
believe
it
was
thicker
than
it
actualy
was
altough
it
was
thicker
than
the
normal
stout
it
produced
a
good
bit
of
head
with
a
decent
rate
of
retention
the
smell
was
very
malty
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
harsh
the
taste
wasnt
as
malty
as
the
smell
was
i
guess
it
was
blended
more
toward
taste
than
smell
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
is
ok
this
beer
is
a
bit
heavy
though
and
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
two
on
any
one
night
still
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
highly
reccomended
ive
yet
to
had
a
bad
beer
from
samuel
smiths
best
english
beer
ive
ever
had
best
stout
ive
ever
had
about
as
close
to
a
perfect
beer
as
i
can
think
of
this
stout
is
as
drinkable
as
they
come
and
no
sip
is
boring
taste
is
smooth
sweetish
chocolaty
just
really
nice
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
with
super
nice
carbonation
and
smoothness
the
only
downfall
on
drinkability
is
that
its
a
bit
heavy
highly
drinkable
at
5
0
abv
and
the
robust
and
addictive
flavors
presented
therein
this
beer
is
breathtaking
and
you
cannot
get
enough
of
it
a
classic
amongst
classic
when
it
comes
to
stouts
overall
i
cant
believe
i
have
never
reviewed
this
one
it
is
always
good
and
always
welcome
in
my
house
not
bad
but
i
expected
more
considering
the
high
score
i
havent
drank
many
stouts
before
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
fluffy
two
finger
head
that
lasted
a
good
5
minutes
still
a
quarter
inch
after
10
minutes
great
aroma
smooth
mouth
feel
some
coffee
and
chocolatey
notes
great
beer
to
savor
every
drink
definetely
try
this
one
beautiful
black
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
very
subtle
aroma
little
touch
of
chocolate
taste
is
amazing
milky
sweet
with
a
chocolatecoffee
characteristic
with
a
very
faint
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
sugary
aftertaste
amazingly
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
of
the
classics
that
first
introduced
me
to
quality
beer
dnot
bad
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
i
would
not
seek
this
out
but
might
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
nice
and
easy
a
good
beer
would
like
to
try
off
tap
with
the
low
abv
i
could
see
this
beer
as
a
perfect
session
beer
this
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
and
again
im
reminded
why
after
a
summer
chock
full
of
hefes
and
pale
ales
this
has
me
really
looking
forward
to
drinking
some
dark
beer
again
if
you
like
stouts
and
havent
had
this
youre
doing
yourself
a
huge
disservice
cause
its
a
real
classic
drinkabillity
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
rated
so
high
i
can
see
myself
going
back
to
this
quite
a
bit
after
a
long
day
out
in
the
sun
like
i
had
today
its
perfect
for
sitting
back
and
taking
my
mind
off
of
things
doesnt
give
me
the
same
full
feeling
i
get
from
other
stounts
so
i
can
see
putting
a
few
of
them
down
in
succession
di
like
itits
my
first
oatmeal
stout
i
can
see
drinking
this
on
a
cold
fall
day
this
is
a
treat
beer
as
i
call
them
that
means
this
couldnt
be
drank
day
in
and
day
outits
nice
to
have
once
in
a
while
i
would
reccomend
this
to
fellow
bas
will
this
help
lower
my
cholesterol
black
almost
completely
opaque
body
with
just
a
slight
rubyred
highlight
and
a
couple
of
fingers
of
tan
head
smells
malty
and
chocolatey
roasted
coffeechocolate
and
caramel
dominate
the
flavor
a
couple
of
slightly
off
flavors
in
the
background

roasted
chocolate
dominates
them
fairly
sweet
fairly
fullbodied
better
than
i
remember
i
am
extremely
impressed
this
is
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
it
never
lets
me
down
when
im
in
need
for
a
rich
drinkable
stout
recommended
the
pour
into
my
fullers
nonic
raises
a
slight
head
due
to
a
light
pour
i
wanted
the
entire
bottle
to
fit
into
the
glass
what
head
it
has
is
tan
the
body
is
quite
black
but
has
a
lot
of
ruby
at
the
edges
when
backlit
the
nose
is
earthy
most
likely
from
english
hops
andquite
chocolatey
and
roasted
too
the
taste
is
slightly
acidic
quite
earthy
and
finishes
with
light
chocolatecoffee
notes
i
do
wish
it
were
less
acidic
but
its
still
enjoyable
the
mouth
is
on
the
fuller
side
with
a
surprisingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
certainly
not
worth
the
5
i
have
to
pay
for
it
one
of
the
most
drinkable
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
ever
tasted
i
enjoy
the
results
of
fermentation
in
slate
tanks
it
has
the
best
appearance
taste
and
smell
of
them
all
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
not
too
strong
so
you
can
have
several
i
enjoy
that
it
has
no
cloying
sweetness
and
a
crisp
aftertaste
this
stout
has
a
luxurious
mouthfeel
and
can
be
counted
on
to
deliver
everytime
the
stout
pours
nearly
pure
black
only
revealing
a
dim
brown
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
massive
foamy
head
is
dark
tan
and
was
totally
retained
through
a
moderately
slow
drinking
i
would
have
to
say
the
smell
has
something
unmistakable
indicating
its
from
samuel
smiths
tadcaster
brewery
there
is
something
underlying
all
their
brews
that
comes
out
in
the
nose
here
beyond
that
there
are
molasses
cola
rooty
licorice
and
anise
smells
a
very
complex
nosefull
the
taste
is
so
smooth
and
round
on
the
palate
with
sweet
syrupy
molasses
and
chocolate
flavors
tempered
by
an
alcoholic
warming
touch
and
a
restrained
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
substantial
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
considering
its
abv
drinkability
for
such
a
rich
beer
its
an
easy
5
pint
session
bravo
not
sure
why
but
my
reivews
of
bas
top
100
end
up
being
a
little
low
colalike
body
leaves
flavours
lingering
in
your
mouth
a
bit
sticky
but
the
taste
makes
you
want
to
keep
it
on
your
taste
buds
as
long
as
possible
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
beautiful
pour
of
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
nice
frothy
head
excellent
aroma
of
toasted
grain
mocha
fruit
and
on
and
on
words
dont
do
the
taste
justice
flawlessly
smooth
and
silky
presence
on
the
palate
perfect
semi
sweet
finish
which
makes
this
brew
so
completely
drinkable
bar
none
a
marvelous
creation
that
deserves
the
attention
drinkability
the
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
but
better
beers
exist
as
a
whole
and
in
the
category
i
would
probably
get
tired
of
this
eventually
because
none
of
this
beers
flavors
have
made
an
impact
on
me
that
would
cause
me
to
go
out
and
get
more
mouthfeeldrinkability
on
the
palate
this
is
dreamy
a
light
relatively
thin
entrance
onto
the
tongue
expands
and
swells
into
a
beautiful
mouthfilling
delight
full
active
yet
subtle
simultaneously
effortless
a
classic
in
its
category
and
worth
trying
and
enjoying
again
and
again
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
nice
brown
head
deep
red
when
held
to
the
light
nice
1
brown
head
great
lacing
sweet
malts
and
oats
combine
to
smell
reminiscent
of
caramel
and
chocolate
simply
excellent
mild
taste
slightly
of
bitter
hops
and
oats
but
is
dominated
by
a
great
malty
caramel
chocolate
taste
mouthfeel
is
great
nice
medium
body
with
relatively
low
carbonation
and
a
great
aftertaste
great
drinkability
this
is
another
offering
from
samuel
smiths
that
i
will
definately
have
again
if
you
like
stouts
this
is
a
must
have
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorites
d
id
drink
it
for
a
night
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
just
right
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
you
cant
go
wrong
with
sam
smith
the
tadcaster
brewery
i
havent
tasted
anything
average
from
this
producer
yet
the
organic
ale
comes
closest
to
average
and
i
hope
the
company
will
never
be
tempted
to
cash
in
on
some
horrid
licenced
stuff
this
one
is
a
refreshing
nutritious
stout
among
all
the
beers
ive
tried
this
is
still
probably
my
favorite
which
says
a
lot
deliciously
dark
stout
organic
oaty
flavor
that
is
just
plain
and
simple
ive
sampled
plenty
of
oatmeal
stouts
and
they
honestly
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
magic
that
samuel
smith
puts
into
ever
pint
it
set
a
new
standard
for
my
enjoyment
of
stouts
in
general
as
a
side
note
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
samuel
smith
yet
and
ive
sampled
all
but
maybe
two
of
them
it
is
truly
a
fine
brewery
an
oatmeal
stout
beautifully
grilled
steak
and
im
in
heaven
pours
an
onyx
black
with
a
thick
tanoffwhite
head
that
thins
down
to
a
ring
and
leaves
a
webbing
on
the
glass
smells
of
nuts
toffee
caramel
coffee
and
oatmeal
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitter
exceptionally
smooth
taste
with
the
same
complexities
of
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
a
mild
aftertaste
very
rich
and
creamy
with
a
chewy
mouthfeel
thick
warming
and
satisfying
very
drinkable
in
both
taste
and
texture
though
a
bit
filling
makes
a
wonderful
compliment
to
a
meal
and
great
as
a
dessert
by
itself
im
editing
my
review
after
2
years
of
drinking
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
but
in
my
enthusiasm
i
scored
it
slightly
higher
than
it
deserves
still
a
solid
a
beer
though
drinkability
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
stout
nothing
to
over
the
top
as
far
as
roastiness
hops
or
malt
just
a
nice
balanced
blend
its
a
good
looking
dark
brown
stout
with
a
nice
creamy
head
primarily
coffee
in
the
nose
though
caramel
might
be
there
also
the
flavor
is
where
its
at
though
this
is
a
top
quality
stout
with
great
balance
the
malt
flavor
isnt
overpowering
and
some
of
the
coffee
in
the
nose
comes
through
on
the
palatte
its
got
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
too
this
isnt
a
thin
beer
if
only
it
werent
so
heavy
you
could
drink
this
one
all
night
its
that
good
but
it
is
filling
the
absence
of
bitterness
makes
it
very
drinkable
when
served
at
a
proper
temperature
though
maybe
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
a
classic
d
its
good
but
its
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
was
a
bit
surprised
to
see
this
rank
as
high
on
the
ba
top
100
as
it
does
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
though
overall
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
but
a
good
brew
althogether
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
be
warned
about
the
higherthannormal
carbonation
per
style
with
this
one
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
this
is
a
definite
must
try
a
very
nice
treat
for
all
the
senses
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
picks
to
enjoy
as
an
after
dinner
beer
without
a
dessert
as
it
is
almost
sweet
enough
on
its
own
merits
a
very
good
choice
to
introduce
yourself
to
the
style
overall
a
very
nice
well
balanced
stout
not
overly
filling
so
i
could
probably
have
a
couple
without
feeling
like
ive
had
a
full
meal
pours
a
thick
colalike
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
pretty
well
smell
is
a
little
odd
wine
like
fruitiness
with
notes
of
caramel
coffee
and
roasted
malt
taste
follows
exactly
with
that
same
winelike
fruitiness
in
the
background
almost
sour
other
noticable
flavors
included
chocolate
and
some
coffee
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
tried
this
beer
so
i
will
get
some
more
from
a
different
store
and
rereview
d
legendary
outstandingly
good
a
prize
of
an
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
i
may
very
well
have
a
new
favorite
beer
overall
its
quite
drinkable
maybe
because
of
the
relative
blandness
but
its
not
anything
id
turn
down
by
any
means
an
excellent
beer
ill
drink
more
for
sure
not
as
smooth
as
i
remember
it
but
still
a
fantastic
beer
in
fact
the
score
went
up
from
my
last
review
recommended
malty
sweetness
chocolate
malt
roasted
barley
oatmeal
creamy
body
at
first
but
it
goes
watery
unless
swallowed
a
little
hastily
finish
is
short
too
subdued
for
my
taste
fine
without
aggressive
burned
flavors
but
more
malt
and
more
bitterness
would
help
i
think
i
would
start
with
some
hops
theres
practically
no
bitterness
or
hop
flavoraroma
and
the
body
is
good
for
beer
in
general
but
not
really
for
oatmeal
stout
a
good
drinkable
beer
ill
try
it
again
sometime
judging
by
the
other
reviews
this
may
not
be
a
fresh
bottle
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
coffee
color
with
deep
brownorange
highlites
two
finger
light
tan
cap
that
dissipates
slowly
aroma
is
distinct
coffee
cocoa
toffee
grain
licorice
slight
cherry
fruitiness
and
a
hint
of
earthiness
flavor
is
dark
carmal
maltiness
with
some
slight
sour
cherry
and
wheat
right
up
front
followed
with
cocoa
coffee
and
roasted
barley
very
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
low
bitterness
and
mediumlight
carbonation
highly
drinkable
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
a
must
try
for
anyone
with
even
the
slightest
interest
in
the
style
i
firmly
believe
that
every
beer
drinker
should
at
least
try
a
few
sam
smiths
in
their
endeavors
i
love
stouts
and
this
is
one
i
can
actually
buy
in
alabama
crappy
beer
laws
d
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
sweet
stout
and
well
worth
the
potential
spoilage
of
a
clear
glass
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
i
really
gave
this
one
a
shot
considering
its
pedigree
but
i
must
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
when
i
first
opened
the
beer
and
took
a
smell
the
first
thing
that
came
to
my
mind
was
breakfast
you
can
smell
the
oatmeal
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
very
smooth
tasting
stout
the
complexity
begins
to
come
out
as
it
warms
up
the
only
downside
is
that
this
beer
feels
like
a
meal
it
goes
down
easy
but
i
could
only
have
about
two
before
i
start
to
feel
full
a
solid
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
oatmeal
stout
d
good
stout
but
not
quite
as
good
as
its
reputation
would
suggest
pours
a
very
deep
brown
bordering
on
black
with
ruby
sparkling
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
a
large
light
tan
head
that
lasts
well
and
leaves
thick
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
muted
with
slightly
burnt
maltiness
and
a
light
coffee
aroma
with
some
earthy
notes
taste
is
rich
and
full
with
bitter
burnt
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
providing
the
base
upon
which
sweet
fruity
and
caramel
notes
are
delicately
layered
making
for
a
wonderful
balance
the
finish
is
sweet
and
long
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
smooth
well
carbonated
and
clinging
and
drinkability
is
stellar
what
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
an
outstanding
evening
or
dessert
beer
overall
this
is
a
stout
i
will
drink
over
and
over
again
it
is
great
with
or
after
a
meal
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
it
very
black
with
a
great
frothy
head
not
much
lacing
though
as
my
daughter
says
it
smells
like
oatmeal
not
as
much
coffee
as
some
but
some
nice
roasted
aroma
i
like
the
sweetness
of
the
aroma
next
to
no
carbonation
hints
of
vanilla
is
nice
a
nice
hop
bitterness
hits
the
palate
but
is
gone
quickly
as
the
dark
malts
take
over
i
also
tasted
tannins
but
in
a
good
way
a
good
froth
in
the
mouth
sweetens
it
up
and
you
can
feel
the
silkyness
that
i
believe
is
imparted
from
the
oats
i
used
to
drink
this
stout
all
the
time
before
it
became
the
norm
upon
my
return
i
am
pleased
to
find
it
robust
in
malt
and
balanced
in
hoppiness
the
aroma
alone
defines
this
stout
as
excellent
and
i
do
say
this
stout
is
actually
very
good
when
fresh
from
the
fridge
in
summer
for
me
anyway
cheers
joe
a
must
try
heavybodied
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
very
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
and
with
a
relatively
low
abv
though
the
drinkability
is
hindered
because
this
beer
is
just
so
heavy
too
filling
it
feels
more
like
a
meal
than
a
beer
excellent
treat
just
dont
expect
to
session
this
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
actually
come
to
think
of
it
i
already
do
drinkability
on
the
whole
not
as
good
as
samuel
smiths
imperial
stout
but
good
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
highly
drinkable
for
me
fairly
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
here
it
is
one
of
my
favs
of
all
time
just
the
taste
and
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
amazing
every
time
i
drink
one
i
come
to
find
that
it
has
a
complete
different
taste
to
it
very
good
in
my
book
the
appearance
is
of
a
pitch
dark
to
almost
cola
like
blackness
to
it
with
a
nice
2
inch
head
and
very
heavy
lacing
on
the
glass
this
stout
has
such
a
good
smell
to
it
i
wished
they
bottled
it
as
a
cologne
it
is
that
good
roasted
oats
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
arabica
coffee
the
taste
is
wonderful
of
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
that
go
down
nice
ans
smooth
leaves
a
great
aftertaste
of
vanilla
i
keep
smacking
and
swallowing
to
shake
that
sour
touch
very
smooth
beer
with
a
distractingly
high
level
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
the
tangy
sour
flavor
is
eventually
too
much
i
think
i
would
drink
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
if
it
werent
there
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
opaque
color
with
a
medium
sized
light
tan
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
sweet
dark
fruit
and
oatmeal
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
slight
alcohol
very
creamy
mouthfeel
with
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
oatmeal
this
was
the
start
of
it
all
for
me
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
poured
to
a
deep
black
with
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
deccent
lacing
as
i
drank
aroma
was
hints
of
chocolate
but
faint
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
especially
at
midglass
but
the
body
seemed
light
and
slightly
watery
had
an
okay
finish
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
enjoyed
the
ss
taddy
porter
and
impy
stout
more
appearance
on
this
beer
is
completely
pitch
black
with
a
thick
rocky
half
inch
white
head
with
some
good
retention
smell
was
dominated
with
lactates
accompanied
with
some
light
coffee
and
chocolate
also
in
the
nose
were
oats
a
hint
of
something
metallic
and
also
a
somewhat
pungeant
vinnegar
smell
taste
was
a
bit
musty
but
big
on
the
oatmeal
and
chocolate
flavors
this
is
a
pretty
big
beer
to
be
had
but
in
a
good
way
in
that
this
one
could
have
fallen
short
i
have
had
many
oatmeal
stouts
that
just
seem
big
and
clunky
just
pure
heavyness
without
anything
to
really
mention
except
its
bigness
this
oatmeal
stout
on
the
other
hand
has
alot
of
personality
and
can
be
easily
identified
as
being
a
samuel
smith
offering
as
far
as
drinkability
although
i
enjoyed
it
one
bomber
was
more
then
enough
for
me
simply
too
much
thickness
for
me
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
this
brewery
they
time
and
time
again
provide
classic
esamples
of
the
styles
that
they
brew
a
great
starting
point
for
anyone
getting
into
quality
beers
looks
the
part
with
a
rich
dark
color
and
a
thick
creamy
head
there
is
a
hint
of
oatmeal
when
you
open
the
bottle
and
in
each
drink
a
very
smooth
highly
drinkable
beer
that
finished
strong
this
beer
was
one
of
my
introductions
to
the
craft
beer
scene
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
revisit
i
have
found
this
beer
to
be
ideally
suited
for
two
applications
as
the
first
beer
of
a
tailgate
a
k
a
breakfast
and
as
a
compliment
to
cashews
an
exceptional
beer
that
i
would
love
to
taste
on
draught
someday
jolly
good
mate
md
moderate
carbonation
for
a
stout
the
hop
crispness
right
as
the
finish
begins
makes
this
beer
all
the
more
drinkable
it
is
pretty
heavy
but
easy
to
drink
i
love
that
a
beer
like
sam
smiths
is
so
readily
available
overall
a
decent
offering
this
ones
really
fantastic
the
flavor
is
very
simple
and
delicate
and
the
mouth
feel
works
exceptionally
well
with
it
very
nice
18
7
ounce
bottle
admittedly
i
succumbed
to
a
ba
taboo
by
writing
this
review
while
slightly
inebriated
but
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
so
strong
especially
after
drinking
red
hook
ipas
which
flavorwise
were
lighter
that
it
didnt
even
matter
if
my
senses
were
slightly
dulled
this
beer
packed
a
whallop
of
flavor
a
great
dessert
brew
a
classic
example
of
the
style
i
had
my
first
ten
years
ago
and
it
has
stayed
delicious
throughout
the
span
way
to
go
limeys
quite
drinkable
good
session
stout
if
thats
your
style
abv
is
only
around
5
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
without
any
bells
or
whistles

samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
is
a
worldclass
beer
that
i
always
try
to
have
in
my
refrigerator
i
found
i
had
to
drink
it
a
little
colder
than
i
normally
like
dark
beers
just
under
or
at
refridgerator
temp
what
about
50f
i
think
overall
this
is
very
good
for
an
oatmeal
stout
its
very
drinkable
and
not
too
heavy
as
far
as
stouts
go
d
high
not
to
alcoholic
not
to
bitter
easy
for
nocrafters
d
highly
drinkable
especially
for
a
stout
not
suggesting
the
beer
doesnt
have
many
characteristics
that
should
be
savored
rather
there
is
a
good
balance
of
complexity
and
drinkability
to
this
beer
in
any
case
a
great
brew
and
one
that
is
really
a
great
introduction
to
the
fact
that
beer
does
not
consist
of
a
piss
colored
beverage
you
suck
down
to
get
loaded
despite
its
nasty
taste
i
went
to
the
store
with
the
explicit
purpose
of
getting
this
beer
because
i
had
a
trend
of
really
bad
oatmeal
stouts
and
i
needed
something
to
restore
my
faith
in
the
style
this
certainly
worked
like
a
charm
this
might
not
be
the
best
example
of
this
style
but
it
is
certainly
a
great
beer
however
ive
had
some
regional
and
local
oatmeal
stouts
that
were
almostjust
asslightly
better
for
less
money
this
is
a
special
treat
and
a
bit
different
than
most
others
nevertheless
it
does
have
nive
coffee
flavors
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
is
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
many
in
the
family
tho
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
session
i
have
had
this
before
as
well
as
reviewed
it
it
has
been
quite
a
long
time
however
and
i
felt
revisiting
it
was
in
order
it
poured
black
with
a
khaki
coloured
thick
foamy
head
which
was
slow
to
dissipate
the
foam
clung
tightly
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
when
tilted
the
smell
is
positively
fantastic
even
better
than
i
had
remembered
quite
honestly
you
can
actually
smell
the
oatmeal
present
on
top
of
a
bit
of
smoke
with
some
sweet
malt
and
very
very
subtle
chocolate
as
well
smells
absolutely
delicious
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
exhibiting
most
everything
present
in
the
smell
the
oatmeal
itself
is
a
bit
less
in
the
taste
and
more
in
the
smell
but
the
smoke
and
chocolate
along
with
the
sweet
roasted
malt
are
all
very
much
present
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
gentle
this
is
better
than
i
had
remembered
it
or
perhaps
my
palate
has
become
more
keen
since
i
last
tried
this
either
way
i
am
very
glad
indeed
that
i
chose
to
revisit
this
one
mouth
enters
with
a
smokier
feel
than
id
anticipated
but
not
overwhelming
or
unpleasant
strong
flavors
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
mint
alternating
between
sweet
and
sour
the
hops
seemed
to
be
a
bit
sour
in
place
of
the
usual
bitterness
but
it
balances
well
with
the
sweetness
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
the
beer
enters
strong
and
fizzy
but
as
it
moves
back
in
the
mouth
it
settles
into
a
creamy
oatmealy
flavored
mouth
cover
that
is
so
damn
enjoyable
i
dont
want
to
swallow
the
nonaggressive
warm
exhale
concludes
this
excellent
gastronomic
experience
now
this
is
damn
good
beer
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
at
around
cellar
temp
this
beer
comes
out
nice
and
dark
almost
pure
black
in
color
as
i
put
the
glass
to
my
nose
i
can
tell
i
going
to
enjoy
this
one
i
get
the
scent
of
chocolate
coffee
and
maybe
some
oats
the
taste
is
outstanding
and
reconfirms
what
my
nose
has
told
me
all
the
flavors
are
there
including
some
maltiness
and
hops
if
anyone
whats
to
get
me
something
for
my
birthday
id
be
more
than
happy
with
this
stuff
a
great
stout
in
my
opinion
i
like
this
one
a
great
deal
yet
one
was
enough
i
generally
like
to
switch
beers
to
keep
the
palate
interested
however
i
will
return
to
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
nice
stuff
that
i
treat
myself
to
every
once
in
a
while
pours
dark
brown
smells
like
cocoa
tastes
like
bitter
cocoa
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
and
not
too
much
like
chocolate
finishes
really
nice
a
bit
tamer
than
the
imperial
stout
but
still
a
damn
good
dessert
beer
i
feel
like
this
is
a
pretty
standard
oatmeal
stout
it
doesnt
appear
as
lights
out
dark
as
some
darker
roasted
stouts
but
it
has
a
bit
more
tan
appearance
around
the
edges
and
leaves
a
medium
in
size
lighter
in
color
head
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
are
the
highlights
of
it
for
me
it
is
fairly
sweet
for
a
stout
it
tones
back
the
darker
malts
and
highlights
sweeter
carmel
maltiness
that
leaves
a
foamy
sweet
mouthfeel
it
has
a
dry
fruity
flavor
that
i
like
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
noticeable
and
i
think
it
takes
a
bit
away
from
the
drinkability
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
but
that
one
is
very
nice
this
is
truly
a
dessert
in
a
bottle
i
really
love
this
stuff
i
think
i
would
take
a
bottle
of
this
over
a
cake
for
my
birthday
very
fine
product
good
head
fairly
decent
aroma
its
walking
by
a
fancy
coffee
shop
and
a
faint
scent
floats
out
the
door
past
your
nose
the
smell
translates
equally
into
a
nice
smooth
mild
favor
slightly
sweet
a
little
toasty
very
creamy
feel
with
just
a
little
carbonation
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
ever
had
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
due
to
its
thinness
and
low
abv
a
classic
from
a
classic
brewery
d
very
easy
going
down
light
on
the
booze
but
a
bit
heavy
on
the
sweetness
to
drink
all
night
this
is
a
very
dark
black
beer
with
barely
a
rubyorange
edge
to
it
the
head
is
tan
and
very
dense
tight
bubbles
smells
a
sour
sweet
malty
flavor
a
strong
caramel
like
smell
to
it
with
a
bit
of
fruity
apple
peel
to
it
this
has
an
awesome
flavor
there
is
a
hint
of
coffee
type
malt
that
comes
out
toward
the
end
of
the
swallow
and
leaves
me
saying
wow
a
chocolatey
coffee
up
front
it
is
that
sweet
malty
smell
maybe
a
little
tamed
but
regardless
it
is
amazing
the
apple
peel
flavor
in
the
nose
is
not
as
strong
to
my
tongue
mouthfeel
is
not
really
syrupy
but
it
has
a
strong
body
to
it
very
very
drinkable
havent
had
this
one
in
awhile
a
year
or
so
and
i
have
been
missing
out
on
so
much
unfortunately
i
think
because
oatmeal
stouts
are
so
good
anyway
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
gets
a
really
good
rating
but
in
the
specific
category
it
just
cant
stand
up
to
some
of
the
smaller
brews
ive
had
but
at
the
grocery
store
samuel
smiths
the
one
oat
stout
you
can
be
sure
is
going
to
be
there
pours
very
dark
almost
black
leaves
a
tan
thick
pleasant
lacy
head
the
smell
is
subtle
yet
intriguing
and
from
first
whiff
the
drinker
can
detect
a
slightly
sweet
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
smooth
sticky
sweet
and
almost
chewy
at
the
same
time
the
roasted
sweet
oat
taste
is
evident
the
carbonation
is
perfect
this
oat
stout
is
by
far
the
tastiest
that
i
have
discovered
unlike
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
this
one
is
creamy
rather
that
watery
and
extremely
smooth
i
would
say
that
it
is
the
pinnacle
of
any
oatmeal
stout
that
i
have
experienced
and
would
recommend
it
to
any
beer
conosiour
as
tasty
as
this
brew
is
unless
you
really
love
your
stouts
i
doubt
you
will
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
enjoy
d
would
be
a
nice
stout
to
have
around
it
is
good
but
it
isnt
great
certainly
worth
a
try
great
quaffability
i
highly
reccomend
this
ressurection
decades
ago
of
a
classic
from
sam
smiths
overall
this
beer
is
warm
and
comforting
it
feels
familiar
it
is
a
terrific
end
to
a
winter
night
it
leaves
you
feeling
warm
inside
an
easy
to
drink
stout
but
not
a
traitor
to
the
traditional
robust
flavor
of
the
stout
flavor
weve
all
came
to
love
cool
clearly
an
impressive
oatmeal
stout
i
love
one
every
now
and
then
usually
with
a
hearty
meat
and
potatoes
meal
but
i
cant
see
drinking
it
daily
or
as
a
session
beer
i
am
a
firm
believer
that
clear
bottles
can
hurt
a
beers
flavor
and
i
defineitely
get
the
same
thing
in
here
that
i
got
in
their
nut
brown
ale
i
think
samuel
smith
would
be
better
served
with
using
dark
bottles
but
thats
just
my
02
i
would
still
try
other
brews
of
theirs
but
wont
grab
for
this
first
if
i
had
other
options
d
really
surprisingly
drinkable
this
is
a
surprise
most
of
the
time
stouts
are
one
and
done
with
the
thickness
and
the
complexity
this
stout
however
balances
the
complexity
with
a
crisp
smoothness
that
makes
it
oh
so
drinkable
comments
i
enjoyed
this
oatmeal
stout
having
never
had
one
of
any
brand
before
initially
i
was
a
bit
put
off
by
the
aroma
the
strong
alcohol
smell
was
overpowering
to
such
an
extent
that
it
overcame
the
rest
of
its
aromatic
character
once
past
the
aroma
the
wonderful
flavor
quickly
charmed
endeared
me
to
this
stout
i
would
like
to
try
others
in
the
same
style
mouthfeel
is
exellent
very
smooth
this
is
an
incredibly
smooth
tasty
beer
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
very
little
light
getting
through
has
an
impressive
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
down
to
just
covering
the
glass
lacing
is
thick
the
smell
is
not
particularly
impressive
some
malt
nothing
outstanding
the
taste
is
malty
and
incredibly
smooth
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
incredibly
mellow
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
there
is
no
getting
used
to
the
taste
it
is
simple
nicely
blended
and
has
no
unpleasant
chalkiness
bitterness
or
other
aftertaste
this
is
something
i
could
slowly
sip
all
night
i
would
take
this
over
any
of
the
few
stouts
i
have
tried
so
far
a
very
creamy
smooth
medium
to
full
body
coupled
with
low
carbonation
makes
this
a
rich
luscious
mouthfeel
this
richness
made
me
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
slowly
and
it
makes
not
so
drinkable
i
can
see
this
as
a
nice
addition
to
a
meal
but
on
its
own
its
a
little
bit
disappointing
not
a
bad
beer
though
i
could
have
finished
the
bottle
but
simply
didnt
want
to
moved
on
to
a
black
hart
stout
and
enjoyed
the
rest
of
the
evening
drinkability
definitely
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
it
may
not
be
the
best
but
its
not
overrated
and
especially
for
the
price
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
treat
to
boot
quality
stuff
all
around
and
the
perfect
amount
of
alcohol
so
you
can
have
a
few
in
a
session
too
if
youre
going
that
route
very
quaffable
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
surpassed
my
expectations
and
made
me
want
more
overall
this
one
gets
better
and
better
as
you
drink
it
the
flavors
really
come
through
as
it
warms
this
isnt
my
1
oatmeal
stout
but
it
is
very
close
it
isnt
too
anything
its
wellbalanced
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
if
i
could
afford
to
i
would
give
this
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
stout
but
it
is
too
expensive
to
be
giving
out
willy
nilly
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
550mlbottle
this
famous
stout
poured
out
a
dark
blackbrown
with
a
small
dark
tan
head
the
smell
was
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolatemolassas
and
coffee
there
was
also
the
above
flavors
in
the
taste
as
wellbut
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
meespecially
for
a
stout
i
felt
the
beer
was
ok
for
mealthough
it
may
be
a
little
overrated
d
this
is
my
2nd
oatmeal
stout
and
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
of
the
stout
styles
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
not
as
heavy
as
one
would
expect
enjoyable
and
i
will
have
it
again
this
was
the
first
oatmeal
stout
i
ever
had
about
34
years
ago
one
of
the
few
beers
that
has
stayed
with
me
throughout
the
years
of
developing
my
palate
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
oatmeal
stout
to
which
all
others
should
be
compared
to
a
benchmark
of
the
style
d
despite
being
heavy
and
a
bit
filling
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
its
very
flavorful
and
not
overpowering
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
just
chill
out
and
relax
with
cheers2beers
another
exceptional
entry
from
the
samuel
smith
line
of
brews
drinks
much
like
their
imperial
stout
if
not
a
tad
short
of
that
classic
smooth
molassesy
finish
with
a
nice
touch
of
sourness
this
is
one
of
the
easiestdrinking
stouts
in
the
world
d
you
cant
really
have
a
multiple
amount
of
these
beers
do
to
how
creamy
and
filling
they
are
but
they
are
so
smooth
anyone
can
have
at
least
one
without
a
problem
a
great
example
of
a
oatmeal
stout
a
classic
of
the
style
one
of
the
beers
that
turned
me
on
to
craft
brew
samual
smiths
oatmeal
stout
is
a
really
good
beer
with
that
said
this
beer
poured
nice
and
dark
with
a
good
creamy
head
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
the
feel
to
this
beer
is
great
kinda
heavy
and
thick
gives
you
an
roasty
malt
taste
oats
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
near
the
end
very
good
over
all
and
i
would
grab
this
one
first
over
all
the
sam
smith
beers
ive
had
d
quite
drinkable
im
going
to
be
buying
this
more
often
i
like
this
a
lot
more
than
i
remembered
again
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
and
one
that
i
wish
i
could
duplicate
on
the
homebrew
scene
samuel
smith
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
the
oatmeal
stout
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
them
very
very
drinkable
i
can
have
many
of
these
in
a
night
d
while
it
does
have
a
low
abv
i
really
wouldnt
call
it
a
session
beer
it
is
just
too
rich
to
drink
too
many
of
them
two
of
them
is
enough
for
me
in
one
night
overall
a
great
beer
sometimes
i
overlook
this
because
of
the
price
i
should
get
it
more
but
for
special
occasions
like
when
im
sober
but
really
a
great
beer
got
3
550
ml
bottles
for
christmas
very
dark
in
bottle
you
can
forget
that
the
bottle
is
clear
im
all
in
favor
of
traditions
but
the
clear
glass
should
go
this
bottle
was
fine
but
i
have
had
off
bottles
problem
is
most
packy
sell
this
if
theyre
going
to
carry
a
gourmet
beer
but
not
alll
stores
take
care
of
them
or
turn
them
fast
enough
the
flavor
was
malty
with
choc
and
coffee
overtones
but
not
as
tasty
as
storm
king
or
some
of
the
better
porters
mouthfeel
also
not
as
thick
as
i
would
expect
form
an
oatmeal
stout
but
the
oats
do
make
it
feel
silky
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
up
to
the
standards
of
the
finest
stouts
and
porters
musings
ive
had
plenty
of
these
in
the
past
first
review
i
do
love
the
taste
of
the
beer
the
body
and
feel
is
just
too
thin
for
my
liking
put
it
against
mcneills
or
even
troegs
and
the
skinny
feel
is
clearly
evident
even
still
a
first
rate
stout
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
heavy
carbonation
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
but
overall
is
a
touch
too
thin
in
flavor
pleasant
drink
but
a
touch
too
subtle
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
the
style
in
general
is
not
for
me
cheers
poured
into
a
large
pint
glass
as
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
blackbrown
color
very
boisterous
light
tan
head
with
exceptional
retention
nose
is
rich
slightly
chocolaty
with
roasted
malt
predominant
slightly
sweet
aroma
taste
is
almost
bittersweet
with
a
strong
maltiness
and
some
bakers
chocolate
deceaving
mouthfeel
that
i
want
to
call
medium
but
finishes
rather
light
instead
low
carbonation
finishes
dryer
with
lingering
roasted
nutty
flavors
this
one
is
a
good
one
maybe
a
very
good
one
if
you
particularly
like
this
style
smooth
and
a
little
sweet
worth
a
try
i
could
simply
not
put
this
one
down
its
rather
easy
to
see
why
this
one
is
a
craft
beer
classic
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
overall
nice
but
its
not
going
into
my
regular
rotation
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
carmel
brown
one
inch
head
a
toasty
granola
smell
a
smooth
sweet
taste
that
lingers
into
a
nice
aftertaste
an
oh
so
drinkable
stout
that
i
feel
sets
the
standard
for
oatmeal
stouts
often
i
use
this
beer
to
introduce
stouts
to
my
friends
who
prefer
lighter
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
wish
to
try
on
tap
some
day
nice
beer
i
prefer
the
imperial
stout
but
this
is
also
good
very
black
in
color
a
short
tan
head
develops
slow
during
the
pour
and
then
fades
quickly
the
carbonation
appears
to
be
average
smell
is
dry
and
chocolatey
mildly
hoppy
the
aroma
is
a
bit
off
it
reminds
me
of
drywall
oddly
enough
the
flavor
is
like
dry
coffee
a
bit
woody
and
slightly
sweet
the
finish
isnt
all
that
bitter
but
it
does
taste
slightly
burnttoasty
the
beer
feels
well
carbonated
its
thick
but
remains
smooth
drinkability
isnt
bad
for
this
one
i
feel
like
my
review
is
lower
than
most
and
i
cant
figure
out
why
in
the
past
ive
liked
this
beer
more
and
this
time
i
got
more
than
one
bottle
from
more
than
one
source
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
skunked
but
i
feel
the
same
way
about
it
each
time
now
i
think
ill
stick
with
the
imperial
stout
instead
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
velvety
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
old
standby
a
year
and
it
usually
makes
me
wonder
why
i
bother
with
anything
else
many
thanks
to
jwff
for
the
sam
smith
gift
pack
not
a
bad
little
stout
but
it
does
feel
like
a
little
stout
i
was
hoping
the
flavor
would
be
a
little
more
aggressive
an
easy
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
although
rather
filling
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
would
like
to
have
another
bottle
from
a
different
batch
it
tasted
a
little
old
to
me
understandable
vancouver
is
a
ways
away
from
jolly
old
drinkability
boy
this
is
one
thick
beer
and
as
filling
as
one
would
expect
from
this
thickness
still
id
feel
ok
spending
a
session
on
the
taddy
oatmeal
stout
oh
how
i
love
this
beer
even
starting
to
write
a
review
about
it
makes
my
mouth
water
the
smell
is
fantastic
a
rich
roasted
malty
flavour
that
attacks
your
senses
you
have
to
pour
this
beer
then
let
it
sit
for
a
while
when
this
beer
is
too
cold
it
destroys
the
taste
like
most
good
beers
in
my
opinion
when
it
gets
to
the
55
degree
mark
start
your
drinking
youll
notice
that
about
halfway
through
your
already
considering
another
one
order
it
before
you
run
out
if
your
not
familiar
with
english
brews
dont
be
surprised
by
the
lack
of
head
thats
a
normal
trait
of
good
english
beers
enjoy
not
a
beer
i
will
be
rushing
back
to
but
a
solid
quality
product
nevertheless
that
i
know
will
pass
over
the
lips
happily
enough
somewhere
in
the
future
d
this
is
hands
down
the
most
complex
and
delicious
beer
that
has
ever
touched
my
lips
if
you
want
to
quit
drinking
swill
and
start
enjoying
good
beer
start
here
not
as
good
as
my
fond
memories
built
it
up
in
my
mind
but
still
a
quality
product
i
think
it
was
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
that
caught
my
attention
so
long
ago
rather
than
the
flavor
highly
highly
recommended
this
ode
to
malt
is
fragrant
tasty
and
luxuriant
get
it
now
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
oatmeal
is
supposed
to
lower
your
cholesterol
were
saved
this
beer
poured
a
dark
almost
opaque
black
with
hints
of
amber
there
is
a
sizeable
frothy
tan
head
that
dissapates
mostly
but
leaves
a
little
froth
the
whole
way
down
the
beer
the
beer
smells
fairly
sweet
with
roasted
malts
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
sweet
but
overall
very
similar
to
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
a
little
drynes
the
drinkability
suffers
a
little
bit
due
to
the
beer
being
so
sweet
but
it
is
still
a
great
drink
d
absurdly
drinkable
an
ideal
session
perfect
for
foods
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
troegs
oatmeal
stout
is
superior
but
this
is
a
different
and
excellent
oatmeal
stout
subtle
tasty
extremely
drinkable
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
bit
pricey
but
then
again
what
the
hell
live
a
little
eh
this
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
hint
a
red
leaving
a
two
finger
head
that
leaves
nice
lacingalthough
the
head
does
leave
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
a
very
deep
mollasses
sweetness
to
it
there
are
also
hints
of
fruitraisins
or
prunes
and
alcohol
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
creamy
and
milky
with
hints
of
coffeealcoholfruitand
mollasses
this
is
a
pretty
sweet
stout
the
mf
is
medium
with
a
nice
balance
this
is
a
very
goodsweetbeer
that
i
enjoy
and
will
have
againbut
i
cant
help
thinking
that
this
is
a
tad
overrated
very
easy
to
drink
after
the
first
sip
your
tongue
has
to
wake
up
the
whole
550ml
bottle
is
rich
and
robust
chewy
very
full
bodied
and
all
the
while
very
enjoyable
great
sipper
in
the
winter

hell
this
one
would
go
great
in
the
summer
too
and
it
has
on
the
deck
at
the
lake
of
the
ozarks
many
times
like
some
many
of
samuel
smiths
beers
its
classic
of
the
style
and
i
personally
havent
found
too
many
other
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
can
honestly
say
are
better
highly
recommended
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
a
little
more
oatmeal
in
this
one
you
may
have
discerned
from
my
name
that
i
love
samuel
smith
beers
poured
deep
brownblack
with
a
tan
fluffy
foam
head
dark
ruby
edges
barely
if
held
to
the
light
lacing
is
moderate
to
sparse
seems
a
bit
soapyish
at
first
aroma
is
mainly
of
fruits
especially
a
dried
raisin
or
prune
smell
slight
hints
of
burnt
cocoa
and
chocolate
as
well
taste
is
mostly
burnt
with
hints
of
sweet
chocolate
and
a
syrupy
fruitiness
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
bad
actually
coated
the
palate
a
bit
and
complemented
the
fruity
and
bitter
finish
not
a
bad
beer
for
every
once
in
a
while
but
not
anything
to
rush
to
your
local
store
for
overall
man
i
love
this
one
as
much
as
ever
ive
had
a
lot
of
stouts
since
the
first
time
i
tried
this
one
and
its
still
high
on
my
list
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
drink
to
my
hearts
fulfillment
without
going
broke
i
could
sip
these
and
eat
chocolate
all
night
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
a
little
bit
tastier
than
youngs
in
my
opinion
everything
seems
to
balance
out
well
in
this
stout
low
bitterness
to
where
the
roasted
taste
is
most
flavorful
also
nuty
sweet
unlike
some
stouts
i
have
tried
the
dark
roast
lingers
nicely
and
not
too
bitterly
just
enough
to
be
very
pleasant
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
as
expected
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
seemingly
no
carbonation
and
a
nice
stout
overall
drinkability
its
good
but
after
a
bottle
ive
had
enough
a
classic
beer
that
is
good
opinion
go
sam
smiths
this
beer
is
a
whole
lot
better
than
i
even
remember
it
to
be
it
has
a
superbly
crafted
balance
with
just
enough
sweet
and
slickness
to
make
it
feel
like
you
just
had
dessert
nice
beer
notes
i
think
this
would
be
the
easiest
stout
to
enjoy
let
the
rooks
sample
this
as
it
has
an
ease
about
it
that
cant
be
matched
i
have
and
would
welcome
sessioning
this
bitch
anyday
overall
a
great
stout
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
in
the
near
future
body
is
where
its
at
just
above
medium
with
a
smooth
as
silk
mouthfeel
and
soft
buttery
texture
that
simply
glides
across
your
palate
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
probably
not
for
everyone
and
for
me
only
a
winter
thing
but
if
in
the
mood
for
a
good
stout
this
is
your
wing
man
i
can
see
why
everyone
loves
this
tasty
filling
and
surprisingly
exquisite
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
light
brown
foamy
mostly
diminishing
head
the
smell
is
quite
good
sweet
chocolate
malts
accompanied
by
aromas
of
molasses
butter
light
spruce
raspberries
and
a
touch
of
prunelike
tawny
port
the
taste
is
of
course
very
maltdominant
bringing
in
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
theres
just
the
slightest
hint
of
citrus
making
the
hops
presence
just
barely
noticeable
but
they
add
a
nice
bitterness
to
the
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
very
low
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
otherwise
it
is
very
enjoyable
do
this
beer
and
yourself
a
favor
and
let
this
warm
up
the
flavors
get
much
more
evident
and
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
despite
it
being
somewhat
thin
drinkability
is
great
for
a
nut
brown
just
wish
i
could
try
this
ontap
somewhere
so
i
could
try
an
untainted
version
pours
true
black
with
hints
of
ruby
only
visible
when
held
up
to
direct
light
even
then
its
just
a
hint
nose
is
strong
with
raisins
and
lighter
with
bakers
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
almost
perfect
for
what
i
would
expect
in
this
style
classic
stout
flavors
shine
through
with
mild
coffee
and
chocalate
as
well
as
some
more
unexpected
nutty
suggestions
the
part
where
sam
smiths
is
set
apart
though
is
the
hop
bitterness
they
have
this
down
perfectly
which
creates
an
amazingly
balanced
beer
which
is
both
filling
yet
wets
the
appetite
aftertaste
is
long
and
perfect
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
just
right
an
exceptional
brew
from
an
exceptional
brewery
i
havent
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
many
oatmeal
stouts
but
sammy
smith
got
this
one
right
excellent
if
you
cant
afford
this
an
excellent
alternative
is
the
aforementioned
mackesons
this
is
a
classic
of
course
not
because
i
said
so
or
because
you
say
so
that
being
said
wiser
men
than
me
by
the
score
no
doubt
will
leave
weightier
opinions
what
i
may
be
able
to
add
is
that
this
beer
is
certainly
not
as
sweet
as
you
may
remember
and
on
that
note
it
deserves
true
characterization
as
a
world
class
stout
along
with
imperials
and
exports
double
americans
and
the
like
pricey
and
worth
it
you
can
easily
drink
the
entire
4pack
in
one
sitting
drinkablity
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
brews
in
one
sitting
this
did
not
fill
me
up
as
fast
as
other
stouts
it
has
a
nice
flavor
from
the
combination
of
oats
and
malts
it
left
my
taste
buds
wanting
more
i
cannot
wait
to
purchase
more
of
this
wonderful
treat
d
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
depth
to
it
the
oat
flavors
come
through
with
layers
of
dark
roasted
malt
the
slight
sour
finish
really
balances
the
malt
in
the
absence
of
hops
overall
recommended
for
fans
of
stouts
this
isnt
a
style
i
particularly
enjoy
but
i
can
appreciate
this
as
an
excellent
representative
drinkability
is
good
but
i
think
one
or
2
is
all
i
could
handle
its
pretty
rich
this
beer
was
tough
to
get
down
actually
i
didnt
even
finish
the
bottle
based
on
other
ba
reviews
im
assuming
this
was
not
the
freshest
of
bottles
however
im
reviewing
this
beer
as
is
since
samuel
smith
makes
no
attempt
to
ensure
the
freshness
of
their
beer
i
e
clear
bottles
no
bornonexp
date
an
excellent
feel
to
this
beer
firm
and
smooth
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
tried
and
no
doubt
will
be
trying
again
taste
is
absolutly
amazing
slightly
roasted
nuts
with
a
coffie
tang
smooth
as
milk
and
twice
as
tasty
like
a
bad
american
i
started
drinking
this
a
tad
too
cold
as
it
warmed
it
really
mellowed
out
and
came
into
its
own
the
flavors
were
much
more
balanced
and
it
just
slid
right
down
ive
had
this
before
but
never
realized
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
until
i
decided
to
review
it
its
a
substantial
brew
without
being
too
boozy
syrupy
or
cloying
an
ideal
winter
session
brew
oh
yeah
i
almost
forgot
oatmeal
is
good
for
drinkability
was
quite
good
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
uf
i
still
dont
know
which
oatmeal
stout
i
like
better
this
or
the
st
ambs
version
but
theres
always
room
for
lots
of
both
in
my
cupboardfridge
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
stouts
are
not
normally
my
thing
im
very
rarely
in
the
mood
for
one
but
when
i
am
in
the
mood
this
will
be
one
of
the
first
stouts
i
reach
for
i
was
really
surprised
not
to
like
this
beer
after
all
the
hype
it
gets
on
this
site
and
the
fact
that
i
usually
love
oatmeal
stouts
but
this
was
just
way
too
sweet
and
had
a
very
off
flavor
to
me
also
the
mouthfeel
was
too
thin
for
the
style
i
thought
one
of
my
least
favorite
stouts
to
date
i
guess
a
lot
of
people
disagree
with
me
on
this
one
but
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
pours
nearly
black
with
ruby
highlights
a
huge
pale
brown
head
forms
very
dense
in
consistency
and
superb
retention
that
coats
the
entire
glass
with
sticky
lacing
very
sweet
roasted
barley
aroma
with
some
molasses
notes
sweet
oats
and
deep
roasted
flavor
is
robust
but
not
overwhelming
the
lack
of
any
hop
profile
is
compensated
by
the
bitterness
from
the
malts
leaving
a
balanced
flavor
that
is
nonresidual
but
also
not
too
dry
light
carbonation
and
a
full
body
lend
a
smooth
and
drinkable
character
that
compliment
the
rich
flavor
burnt
malt
and
overly
sweet
aftertaste
create
a
flash
of
soy
sauce
which
fades
quickly
but
leaves
a
slightly
astringent
finish
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
however
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
the
price
it
was
smooth
but
there
really
wasnt
much
going
on
with
this
beer
give
it
to
someone
that
thinks
guinness
is
too
much
i
dont
understand
the
hype
on
this
one
but
if
youd
like
to
send
a
bottle
to
reconsider
ill
gladly
drink
it
if
there
were
a
roasted
brown
ale
this
is
it
not
your
run
of
the
mill
stout
here
much
easier
to
finish
off
than
some
of
the
other
stouts
ive
drank
in
the
past
year
especially
when
served
just
under
room
temperature
unlike
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
there
is
more
than
just
a
hint
of
the
surname
in
the
smell
and
taste
great
head
and
lacing
can
fill
you
up
however
i
was
thrown
by
this
one
thought
the
bottle
was
brown
the
beer
is
really
that
dark
nice
and
opaque
with
a
few
reddish
brown
tints
nice
two
finger
head
frothy
sticks
to
the
glass
in
a
nice
lace
top
to
bottom
the
smell
is
strong
and
sweet
like
brown
sugar
with
oats
the
taste
is
very
good
smooth
and
sweet
to
start
with
a
nice
coffee
finish
not
overly
bity
on
the
end
very
nice
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
strong
i
will
buy
this
one
again
havent
had
this
one
in
a
very
long
time
why
did
i
stay
away
so
long
if
you
have
recently
been
consumed
with
the
more
recent
and
over
the
top
offerings
come
back
and
revisit
this
classic
you
will
be
glad
you
did
ive
had
this
before
and
i
remember
enjoying
it
so
this
bottle
could
have
been
treated
poorly
but
the
brewery
uses
clear
bottles
so
they
are
certainly
not
the
victim
here
i
will
most
likely
try
another
bottle
in
the
future
not
the
near
future
with
hopes
for
the
best
pours
a
dark
brownblack
little
carbonation
small
head
out
of
a
clear
bottle
not
much
lacing
scents
of
malt
toffeecaramel
sweetness
smells
stronger
than
its
abv
tastes
a
little
sour
and
finishes
a
little
dry
medium
body
at
5
abv
you
could
drink
a
few
a
good
session
brew
the
clear
bottle
will
keep
me
away
from
this
brew
not
telling
how
long
its
been
sitting
there
this
beer
looks
a
lot
like
motor
oil
that
has
not
been
changed
in
bout
tenthousand
miles
i
like
it
smells
like
beer
taste
like
nothing
i
have
ever
had
almost
like
it
was
recently
on
fire
as
a
friend
of
mine
put
it
it
is
a
god
damn
beer
as
in
god
damn
thats
good
i
think
i
would
definatly
drink
this
again
even
at
4
50
a
bottle
this
beer
has
a
wonderfull
appearance
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
it
lets
a
very
small
amount
of
light
through
it
poured
with
a
average
sized
tan
head
that
did
not
stick
around
very
long
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
presence
of
roasted
oats
i
gave
it
a
3
5
on
drinkability
due
to
a
strange
aftertaste
this
beer
tastes
as
if
the
alcohol
content
is
higher
that
the
listed
5
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
as
a
oatmeal
stout
but
however
a
solid
choice
overall
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
you
really
should
check
this
out
more
of
a
hop
presence
and
noticeable
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
than
many
but
i
feel
that
lends
more
character
than
it
takes
away
overall
its
trueas
ive
been
told
samuel
smith
makes
the
highest
quality
brews
and
this
is
one
of
them
like
stout
try
this
one
it
feels
great
my
mouth
is
tickled
pink
drinking
this
it
screams
give
me
more
my
stomach
too
tells
me
to
keep
this
one
coming
it
coats
the
inside
of
my
gullet
making
me
feel
warm
and
strong
tastes
like
health
very
good
oatmeal
stout
one
of
my
favorite
and
at
3
99
a
bottle
it
better
be
one
of
my
favorites
d
a
nice
sipper
like
many
stouts
ive
tried
i
could
definitely
sit
and
enjoy
two
or
three
of
these
at
the
end
of
the
night
i
would
recommend
but
would
also
love
to
try
this
ontap
to
see
the
difference
pours
a
clear
black
with
some
red
highlights
around
the
edges
and
a
thick
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
as
well
smell
is
sweet
and
roasty
some
chocolate
and
grass
is
present
taste
is
lots
of
anise
some
roasted
chocolate
coffee
oats
and
grass
smooth
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
pretty
tasty
although
the
taste
is
off
because
of
the
clear
bottle
a
classic
good
reputation
for
a
reason
always
satisfying
and
highly
recommended
great
stout
pours
a
dark
almost
opaque
brown
with
an
impressive
brownish
tan
head
though
watery
and
not
thick
on
the
pour
like
mackeson
theres
a
nice
maltsorghum
nose
though
again
not
quite
as
complex
or
pleasing
as
in
mackesons
offering
flavor
is
good
slightly
bitter
with
a
strong
presence
of
toasted
malt
its
a
pleasantly
liquid
beer
going
down
easily
but
not
as
thick
or
substantial
as
id
prefer
the
finish
is
pleasingly
bitter
again
i
find
this
to
be
a
superior
stout
but
i
believe
that
mackeson
edges
it
out
in
several
important
areas
including
appearing
taste
and
mouthfeel
an
excellent
stout
that
i
find
myself
picking
up
often
i
think
one
of
the
ingredients
is
awesomeness
this
is
the
best
sam
smiths
i
have
ever
had
purchased
at
harringtons
in
chelmsford
ma
due
to
the
clear
bottles
they
use
its
possible
that
my
previous
forays
were
with
light
touched
beer
or
maybe
i
just
failed
to
truly
appreciate
the
goodness
whatever
the
real
story
a
most
excellent
beer
overall
d
very
drinkable
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
beers
that
i
have
had
almost
pitch
black
in
colour
the
tan
head
on
this
brew
didnt
last
too
long
nice
malty
caramel
aroma
with
chocolate
notes
surprisingly
carbonated
and
bitter
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
coffee
notes
that
i
was
expecting
but
i
did
get
more
malt
and
chocolate
a
bit
thin
bodied
but
still
an
excellent
brew
this
brew
pours
darker
than
a
black
steers
tookus
on
a
moonless
prairie
night
its
massive
whitish
tan
head
lingers
around
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
everything
that
can
be
hoped
in
an
oatmeal
stout
creamy
nutty
chocolaty
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
quite
simply
as
perfect
as
the
aroma
creamy
and
chocolaty
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
beyond
discription
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
ever
had
more
would
be
good
how
is
it
on
tap
and
where
can
one
obtain
it
so
the
bar
that
i
compare
other
oatmeal
stouts
with
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
only
very
dark
ruby
highlights
shine
through
forms
a
stiff
tan
head
that
remains
and
laces
smells
mildly
of
barley
malt
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
cappuchino
throw
in
some
mild
souring
as
well
no
hop
aromas
flavors
are
similar
to
those
in
the
nose
only
much
more
bold
rich
and
full
never
gets
astringent
or
grainy
big
body
finishes
with
flavors
of
plumbs
and
grapes
not
wine
finishes
silky
smooth
modestly
sweet
the
oatmeal
rarely
shows
flavors
but
adds
to
the
richness
and
smoothness
of
the
beer
i
highly
recomend
this
is
a
beautiful
smooth
subtle
easy
going
stout
no
its
not
going
to
kick
you
in
the
teeth
but
thats
fine
with
me
im
more
than
happy
to
be
seduced
by
a
beer
rather
than
overpowered
by
one
too
bad
i
cant
get
this
stuff
here
regularly
and
too
bad
i
only
brought
one
back
from
calgary
all
i
can
figure
from
this
is
that
this
6pack
must
have
been
mistreated
i
will
try
again
from
a
different
retailer
and
see
if
i
see
things
differently
next
time
but
this
one
was
nasty
i
havent
had
too
many
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
can
think
of
but
this
is
pretty
good
as
far
as
stouts
on
the
whole
go
i
wasnt
quite
wowed
by
this
but
id
give
it
another
go
next
to
others
of
the
style
more
goodness
from

deep

almost
a

scent
odd
but
intriguing
tastes
of
coffee
toffee
and
malt
roastedness
and
a
sourtarttangyness
that
i
really
enjoy
oats
also
add
to
the
character
of
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
chewy
the
sourness
becomes
a
bit
hard
to
stomach
after
a
while
almost
starts
to
remind
me
of
cough
syrup
but
overall
not
a
bad
experience

the
color

acidity
to
it
a
good
session
brew
with
the
low

this
is
the
first
ale
that
got
me
started
on
the
stout
kick
i
can
remember
being
in
college
and
having
this
for
the
first
time
in
between
classes
in
business
college
their
are
stout
styles
out
their
that
offer
more
in
terms
of
favor
imo
over
all
this
is
an
easy
going
beer
and
is
worth
checking
out

very
tasty
this
is
really
deserving
of

sam
you
done
better
with
your
stout
than
you
did
with
your
brown
son
drinkability
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
even
in
the
summer
heat
although
i
dont
think
one
would
want
to
make
a
session
out
of
it
still
very
approachable
its
one
of
those
beers
where
bmc
drinker
will
be
intimidated
by
its
motor
oil
appearance
and
leave
it
alone
although
he
will
still
insist
that
hes
a
real
man
and
dont
drink
that
weird
beer
as
he
pounds
his
bud
light
oh
well
more
of
the
good
stuff
for
the
bas
this
beer
may
be
much
much
better
on
tap
which
could
be
said
the
same
for
many
other
beers
therefore
i
cant
help
but
add
that
the
oatmeal
stout
came
a
long
way
from
england
to
the
land
where
oatmeal
stouts
do
not
rule
enough
for
people
clear
the
shelves
in
time
for
fresher
batches
however
i
do
recommend
this
for
special
occasions
all
the
while
served
cold
and
i
mean
cold
serving
it
warm
can
make
the
stout
way
too
unappealingly
sweet

goblet

black
with

its
topped
with
a

inch

that
doesnt
leave
much
lace
but
i
was
swirling
the
beer
a
bunch
also
smells
like
apples
banana
pudding
chocolate
coffee
raisins
yeast
and
lots
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
the
same
but
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
some
pineycitric
hops
whose
bitterness
appears
more
as
the
beer
warms
the
body
is
full
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
the
beer
itself
is
a
topnotch
brew
overall

one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
highly
recommended

you

love
this
beer
highly
recommended
over
your
average
brew
but
as
far
as
stouts
go
you
can
do
better
even
so
this
one
wont
disappoint

it

of
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
and
honey
carmel
and
apple
tastes
are
there
but
to
a
lesser
degree
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
filling
and
very
enjoyable
overall

one
of
my
favourite
oatmeal
stouts
highly
recommended
if
you
like
this
style
very
very
drinkable
just
what
youd
hope
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
the
brewers
have
avoided
some
of
the
more
aggressive
notes
that
can
tend
towards
burnt
coffee
or
bitter
chocolate
and
have
instead
created
a
brew
which
is
classic
sweet
dark
and
creamy
appearance
and
smell
not
completely
black
there
are
ruby
edges
and
light
can
actually
penetrate
this
beer
if
it
is
bright
enoughviewed
at
the
right
angle
head
is
modest
receding
to
a
fine
lace
oddly
enough
i
know
ive
had
some
bottles
that
produced
very
little
if
any
head
or
lacing
although
i
dont
remember
the
flavor
ever
suffering
much
due
to
this
drinkability
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
that
people
should
try
becareful
when
buying
because
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
and
you
dont
know
how
long
its
been
sitting
out
drinkability
is
good
for
this
style
edit
search
for
my
post
in
the
food
beer
forum
for
barbecue
stout
burgers
they
were
excellent
with
this
brew
dn
i
had
this
one
more
than
a
decade
ago
on
tap
in
spain
this
beer
isnt
even
close
to
what
it
could
be
i
cant
shake
the
skunkiness
i
smelled
when
i
first
opened
this
one
no
head
average
tastes
not
something
id
recommend
a
drink
to
sink
your
teeth
into
drink
it
by
itself
or
with
hearty
food
that
can
stand
up
to
it
poured
a
dedep
black
almost
opaque
color
smell
is
of
coffee
and
expresso
taste
is
enjoyable
but
nothing
spectactular
left
a
nice
dry
taste
drinkable
but
nothing
above
average
after
reading
all
tghe
great
reviews
i
was
a
bit
disapointed
ive
tasted
better
stouts
a
damn
tasty
brew
i
cant
wait
to
head
south
of
the
border
again
and
pick
up
more
of
this
incredible
stout
cause
it
cant
be
found
in
canada
mouthfeel
refreshing
not
every
stout
is
refreshing
to
drink
some
stouts
are
refreshing
but
too
watery
this
stout
has
an
excellent
balance
of
body
and
flavor
drinkable
and
inviting
this
is
a
smooth
well
made
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
should
really
drink
more
of
this
stuff
appears
a
really
dark
color
that
i
will
now
coin
as
pitch
brown
basically
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
black
without
actually
being
totally
black
darkness
i
think
you
all
know
what
i
mean
the
brown
head
lasts
and
lasts
til
the
beer
is
gone
all
the
way
down
my
friends
smell
is
totally
sweet
and
creamy
which
carries
over
to
the
taste
in
addition
to
the
milky
sweet
cream
taste
theres
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
taste
and
a
low
bitterness
profile
whereas
their
imperial
stout
has
that
burnt
bitter
flavor
this
one
is
all
about
the
soft
buttery
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
i
would
even
say
thin
for
a
stout
but
thats
the
way
i
like
my
stouts
not
chewy
thats
not
to
say
that
this
beer
isnt
hefty
though
sure
is
a
really
superb
beer
that
ill
remember
next
time
im
craving
a
good
stout
the
beer
goes
down
fairly
well
i
think
i
will
revisit
this
one
someday
soon
as
i
also
get
the
feeling
that
this
one
will
grow
on
you
with
time
pours
an
opaque
deepest
brown
color
with
a
luxurious
creamy
beige
colored
head
not
much
head
retention
or
lacing
but
a
nice
looking
pint
dark
roasty
matly
aroma
with
some
cereal
grain
quality
to
it
no
discernable
hop
aroma
other
than
a
mild
earthiness
mostly
roasty
and
sweet
with
some
caramel
coffee
treacle
and
chocolatelike
undertones
torrefied
oat
is
a
garnish
amongst
the
malt
the
sweetness
is
maltose
almost
bordering
lactose
somewhat
bitter
in
the
finish
maybe
some
challenger
in
the
kettle
very
drinkable
a
quintessential
example
of
a
fullbodied
lower
abv
oatmeal
stout
notes
i
flipped
a
coin
to
determine
which
stout
i
would
drink
and
which
would
be
used
as
a
marinade
tadcaster
oatmeal
stout
survived
and
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
became
the
marinade
for
my
rib
eye
it
was
an
enjoyable
steak
and
it
did
go
excellent
with
this
one
slàinte
pours
a
dark
brown
deep
red
edges
with
a
tan
foamy
head
lasting
a
few
minutes
little
lacing
to
space
of
delicious
smells
of
milk
chocolate
and
walnuts
cookies
cereal
interlaced
with
traces
of
vanilla
taste
of
nutty
molasses
toastiness
butterscotch
and
grassy
hops
overall
lightly
sweet
ends
with
bitter
roasted
coffee
and
a
long
dry
finish
softly
carbonated
and
full
bodied
but
wonderfully
drinkable
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
and
would
love
to
actually
try
it
with
ham
and
eggs
absolute
yum
ultimately
drinkable
a
favorite
pours
a
bitch
black
color
with
a
giant
light
brown
head
smells
very
sweet
like
chocolate
and
dark
malts
the
taste
let
me
get
to
the
taste
wow
silky
full
bodies
with
strong
chocolate
and
butterscotch
flavors
some
coffee
and
oats
too
a
little
bit
of
hop
background
this
beer
is
almost
perfect
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
breakfast
everyday
550
ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
very
nearly
black
with
a
tan
head
rich
malty
aroma
slightly
sweet
malty
flavor
with
some
roastiness
this
beer
has
an
amazingly
smooth
mouthfeel
which
i
assume
is
from
the
oats
this
is
an
incredible
beer
that
i
am
especially
partial
to
as
it
is
one
of
my
first
introductions
to
quality
beer
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
good
stout
for
the
inexperienced
stout
drinker
of
course
its
a
great
choice
for
the
experienced
drinker
too
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
i
think
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
a
very
drinkable
beer
these
are
made
to
be
put
back
with
abandon
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
such
a
highly
rated
beer
i
would
rather
spend
the
money
on
the
troegs
or
barney
flats
550
ml
clear
glass
bottle
no
freshness
date
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
very
nice
the
beers
aroma
has
the
usual
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
found
in
most
stouts
but
theres
a
also
fairly
major
fruity
presense
that
pulls
it
all
together
normally
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
flavors
in
beer
but
i
like
it
here
its
not
overpowering
and
its
a
nice
compliment
to
the
slightly
sweet
character
of
the
oats
and
the
chocolate
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
just
as
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
the
finish
couldve
used
a
little
more
bitterness
but
its
not
that
bad
all
things
considered
this
is
a
great
beer
its
much
more
understated
than
samuel
smiths
imperial
stout
and
i
like
it
better
that
way
pours
out
to
a
dark
brown
dark
burgandy
color
dense
brown
foamy
head
was
long
lived
as
was
the
sweet
floral
like
aroma
mixed
with
dark
chocolate
taste
was
smooth
and
rich
with
complex
flavors
of
coffee
oats
and
chocolate
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
hang
around
for
a
bit
longer
than
i
would
like
but
none
the
less
it
was
enjoyable
a
reasonably
priced
beer
for
those
looking
for
a
heavier
brew
this
is
probably
the
definitive
oatmeal
stout
that
is
widely
available
today
recommended
ill
definitely
be
getting
more
of
these
glad
to
know
that
some
things
dont
change
what
a
delightful
stout
a
world
classic
very
english
tasting
indeed
one
word
masterful
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
the
classic
oatmeal
stout
while
far
from
the
best
this
is
an
easily
enjoyed
beer
most
suitable
for
a
spring
evening
the
flavor
seems
like
it
would
go
with
dessert
well
this
is
a
must
try
on
your
road
to
beer
advocacy
samuel
smith
makes
consistently
good
beers
and
i
now
believe
that
they
are
the
best
in
england
overall
very
enjoayble
sadly
i
can
only
get
this
around
christmas
time
in
the
samuel
smith
gift
box
this
beer
is
made
with
the
finest
ingridients
and
has
the
taste
to
prove
it
this
may
be
the
smoothest
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
samuel
smiths
beers
are
very
pricey
but
it
is
not
hard
to
figure
out
why
after
you
have
tasted
it
this
is
a
great
started
beer
but
unless
you
are
bill
gates
i
would
not
suggest
drinking
this
all
night
great
novelty
item
beer
a
god
beer
to
oh
and
ah
beer
mates
try
it
if
you
can
afford
it
a
damn
fine
beer
all
around
samuel
smiths
probably
makes
the
best
english
beer
and
the
oatmeal
stout
is
probably
their
best
one
so
good
everyone
should
try
this
beer
at
least
once
good
carbonation
and
medium
to
heavy
body
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
thick
cream
head
that
has
exceptional
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
malt
almost
chocalety
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
exceptional
it
is
as
smooth
as
smooth
can
be
not
all
overpowering
on
the
tastebuds
something
that
detracts
me
from
some
stouts
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
say
yes
please
ill
have
another
and
then
another
and
maybe
one
more
after
that
pours
out
a
very
nice
black
beer
with
a
big
tan
34
finger
head
that
lasts
pretty
good
sweet
fruity
aroma
thats
quite
pleasant
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
about
the
taste
of
this
beerit
was
quite
bitter
but
it
may
have
been
a
bit
too
cold
as
the
beer
warmed
i
really
started
liking
it
flavors
are
hard
to
pinpoint
but
definitely
a
nice
coffee
type
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
just
a
tad
bit
watery
for
a
stout
a
nice
stout
that
ill
be
buying
again
overall
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
i
dont
think
id
had
it
since
i
was
a
wee
beer
novice
and
now
im
cursing
myself
for
waiting
so
long
to
try
it
again
i
will
definately
be
going
back
to
this
very
soon
wow
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
pours
a
nice
dark
color
there
was
a
very
nice
head
which
lasts
for
a
long
time
the
small
was
of
nice
sweet
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
amazingly
smooth
and
the
taste
was
exceptional
this
is
a
stout
which
everyone
must
sample
enjoy
poured
a
solid
black
with
just
a
hint
of
red
on
the
edges
with
a
thick
dark
brown
head
smell
was
oaty
goodness
chocolate
roasted
malts
very
inviting
taste
was
more
of
the
same
very
good
it
would
have
been
a
shame
if
this
style
had
disappeared
like
it
almost
did
it
has
a
very
decadent
creamy
mouthfeel
similar
to
the
imperial
stout
but
not
as
overwhelming
drinking
this
all
night
would
be
a
little
bit
much
but
it
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
a
little
rich
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
but
youll
definately
want
to
overall
truly
incredible
a
remarkable
stout
which
is
tremendously
complex
very
rich
and
heavy
so
i
think
it
would
be
quite
a
task
to
drink
more
than
2
bottles
of
this
stuff
12
liter
clear
bottle
pour
reveals
a
dark
black
viscous
ale
with
a
tight
pored
mocha
colored
cap
with
great
retention
wonderful
lacing
nose
fills
with
aromas
of
unsweetened
chocolate
pine
and
some
burnt
toast
wonderful
thick
silky
mouth
feel
burnt
cocoa
lactose
dried
currents
and
figs
damp
oak
wonderful
complex
body
finish
is
delightfully
lingering
where
the
smoothness
of
this
ale
is
detected
no
shrarp
edges
acidic
charred
grain
presence
in
some
stouts
the
oatmeal
does
its
trick
in
the
finish
giving
an
impression
of
thick
cream
and
tart
cocoa
an
oatmeal
stout
to
be
savored
i
had
this
again
after
many
years
and
it
is
still
the
same
which
is
nice
being
a
ss
product
i
agian
taste
metals
in
the
beer
but
maybe
that
is
just
me
the
color
it
pours
is
black
comprised
of
red
looking
though
at
the
right
angle
shows
the
beers
color
of
ruby
so
dark
it
becomes
black
it
makes
sense
as
the
stout
is
just
a
built
up
amber
and
this
beer
is
a
near
perfect
in
color
in
my
eye
the
nose
is
a
little
lacking
as
the
malt
seems
subdued
but
there
is
a
presences
of
earth
roastedness
and
chocolate
oats
that
escape
this
has
a
great
feel
in
the
mouth
of
silky
oat
protiens
that
carry
a
roast
bitterness
that
is
delightful
still
this
beer
has
a
metalic
aftertaste
that
i
couldnt
seem
to
shake
it
left
lace
all
the
way
down
my
glass
it
would
be
hard
to
make
a
better
mild
oatmeal
stout
a
mixture
of
every
color
except
black
the
aroma
is
deep
yet
mild
a
subtle
perfume
of
chocolate
vanilla
pit
fruit
milk
wet
leaves
and
currants
i
love
the
creamy
texture
and
the
suprising
full
body
rich
deep
malts
nice
chocolate
coffee
minimal
but
identifiable
sourness
and
a
nice
pleasing
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
lovely
brew
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
somewhat
mild
but
there
are
roasted
malts
and
coffee
in
there
the
flavor
is
nice
and
malty
and
creamy
nice
roasted
malts
flavor
as
well
as
some
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
great
mouthfeel
really
good
beer
beautiful
dark
pour
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
an
earthy
smell
and
a
mixed
taste
of
caramel
chocolate
and
nuts
blasts
the
senses
this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
going
down
and
leaves
an
aftertaste
of
oats
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
add
to
my
list
of
favorites
a
very
drinkable
version
of
the
style
given
how
tasty
and
mild
on
the
palate
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
one
id
be
happy
to
drink
anytime
pours
a
black
color
with
ruby
glints
and
a
diminutive
tan
head
lacing
is
a
good
webwork
the
aroma
is
of
caramalized
sugar
chocolate
and
cappacino
the
flavor
is
a
complex
mix
of
sweet
malts
theres
lots
of
milk
chocolate
brown
sugar
coffee
cocoa
and
subtle
fruit
flavors
hoppiness
and
burnt
barley
flavors
are
present
but
very
minimal
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
with
a
velvet
like
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
very
unique
and
delicious
stout
id
imaginie
milk
stouts
taste
similar
to
this
sweetish
stout
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
the
first
chilly
day
of
autumn
weve
had
in
this
unseasonably
warm
texas
fall
and
this
makes
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
the
cold
the
beer
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
finger
of
cream
colored
head
the
nose
is
chocolate
chip
oatmeal
cookies
from
the
malt
and
the
oatmeal
it
smells
really
good
the
oats
are
very
present
the
flavor
is
the
flavor
is
good
with
lots
of
chocolate
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
good
as
well
even
without
the
cold
having
hit
yet
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
this
doesnt
fill
me
up
too
much
making
it
a
nice
beer
terrific
foamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
great
for
a
stout
this
beer
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
foamy
tan
head
smell
is
of
yeasty
esters
with
a
grainy
background
there
is
a
hint
of
a
vinous
character
in
the
smell
a
characteristic
of
the
yeast
i
think
taste
is
smooth
but
rich
and
complex
dry
roasted
maltiness
with
an
earthy
character
and
a
hint
of
bittersweet
full
bodied
yet
smooth
as
silk
excellent
drinkablility
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
dark
ruby
burgundy
rather
clear
under
a
voluminous
three
finger
head
that
settled
pretty
quickly
to
half
a
pencils
worth
of
head
for
the
duration
leaving
a
few
spots
of
lace
nice
roasted
nuts
and
raisin
nose
the
mouth
is
fairly
flat
and
rather
syrupy
heavy
nice
smooth
malt
taste
with
a
distinct
citrus
sour
element
to
balance
the
bready
grain
a
touch
of
smooth
bitter
hops
struggle
to
emerge
from
the
oatmeal
blanket
and
do
leave
some
notes
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
raisin
with
a
touch
of
lemon
maybe
the
bottle
was
light
struck
but
this
was
not
the
knockout
brew
i
had
hoped
for
notes
this
was
a
fairly
solid
beer
that
was
a
nice
sweet
alternative
to
the
sinebrychoff
porter
which
i
also
enjoyed
pours
a
nice
dark
smooth
black
very
nice
smooth
sweet
smell
of
nuttienes
with
a
taste
of
dark
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
prunes
and
a
slight
hint
of
oatmeal
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
that
supports
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
this
beer
is
a
classic
drinkability

this
is
a
good
heavy
stout
thats
light
on
the
oatmeal
but
wellbalanced
nevertheless
this
beer
pours
dark
and
has
a
nice
tan
head
that
sits
about
a
half
inch
tall
it
smells
like
molasses
malt
and
a
little
alcoholic
it
has
a
great
flavor
tastes
of
malt
roasted
barley
chocolate
and
as
it
hits
the
back
of
you
pallat
you
get
that
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
like
the
mouthfeel
a
lot
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
it
coats
the
mouth
nicely
this
a
very
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
overall
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
this
is
the
first
stout
that
i
really
got
my
girlfriend
to
enjoy
and
thats
saying
a
lot
because
she
is
not
a
stout
drinker
at
all
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
fall
months
when
its
not
cold
enough
to
demand
a
stronger
stout
cant
drink
too
many
though
as
it
can
become
quite
filling
drinkability
given
its
meal
in
a
can
nature
this
isnt
a
good
session
beer
but
good
every
once
and
a
while
this
beer
is
black
with
hint
of
redbrown
when
held
to
a
light
it
has
a
very
nice
thick
creamy
head
that
is
tan
in
color
and
lasts
the
taste
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
is
mildly
sweet
but
well
balanced
this
a
very
drinkable
mediumfull
bodied
beer
also
try
rogue
shakespeare
stout
for
a
little
more
body
a
truer
stout
smell
was
a
roasted
malty
nutty
assault
on
the
senses
taste
followed
suit
with
similar
roasted
coffee
chocolate
tastes
this
is
a
full
flavored
beer
but
far
from
perfect
i
think
the
roasted
taste
creates
a
somewhat
one
dimensional
brew
due
to
its
overbearing
nature
i
didnt
feel
like
drinking
many
of
these
i
needed
a
change
up
after
the
first
one
pours
a
deep
dark
brownish
black
in
which
a
beautiful
offwhite
head
appears
and
nicely
laces
the
glass
aromas
are
off
roasted
malts
some
other
sweet
malts
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
extremely
malty
showing
off
a
nice
array
of
roasted
and
toasty
flavors
following
a
nice
smooth
and
sweet
oat
flavor
along
with
a
slight
molasses
take
hold
which
adds
a
complex
sweetness
to
this
brew
finally
this
beer
finishes
with
yet
more
roast
flavors
and
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
keep
things
just
perfect
this
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
to
it
with
a
nice
medium
body
simply
a
great
beer
this
poured
out
a
nice
thick
dark
black
with
about
half
an
inch
of
tan
head
the
head
dropped
fairly
quickly
and
didnt
leave
much
lace
aroma
is
packed
full
of
chocolate
and
malty
goodness
with
a
bit
of
coffee
thrown
in
the
mix
very
sweet
and
creamy
tasting
with
chocolate
standing
at
the
forefront
and
a
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavor
blending
in
a
good
blend
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
balances
this
out
fairly
well
with
sweetness
being
more
dominate
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
mouthfeel
was
a
good
medium
body
and
creamy
feel
to
it
very
good
drinkability
as
i
had
no
problem
downing
a
few
of
these
excellent
oatmeal
stout
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
taste
is
very
sweet
and
smooth
minimal
carbination
makes
this
so
easy
to
consume
very
deep
flavors
and
a
drinkability
that
is
hard
to
compare
as
far
as
stouts
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
underneath
the
sweet
flavors
a
good
example
of
the
style
mabye
a
little
sweet
but
that
is
the
style
full
of
flavour
pours
out
a
nice
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
a
milkchocolate
colored
head
rapidly
appeared
fairly
aggressive
pour
and
built
to
a
very
thick
fluffy
mass
it
slowly
settled
to
a
nice
collar
with
some
excellent
lacing
this
head
survived
several
swirls
the
aroma
is
good
smelled
something
of
oats
chocolate
malt
and
faint
hops
very
pleasant
but
not
overwhelming
taste
was
very
rich
with
a
complex
development
of
oats
chocolate
malt
and
other
darkly
roasted
malt
flavors
starts
sweet
then
finishes
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
for
balance
excellent
mouthfeel
was
every
so
slightly
thinner
than
i
expected
though
it
did
not
seriously
hurt
the
beer
slightly
higher
than
expected
carbonation
but
again
not
so
much
as
to
be
terribly
distracting
this
is
truly
an
excellent
stout
to
be
enjoyed
whenever
the
mood
strikes
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
good
stuff
the
mouthfeel
shows
an
incredible
smoothness
this
beer
is
so
enjoyably
creamy
but
at
the
same
time
it
remains
greatly
light
and
drinkable
with
a
very
pleasing
level
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
sweeter
and
more
aired
than
i
expected
the
beers
almost
breathing
in
my
mouth
great
this
is
a
very
good
stout
its
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
brownish
white
head
the
head
is
deliciously
frothy
when
i
take
my
first
sip
and
it
remains
for
the
whole
pint
this
defining
characteristic
of
the
taste
is
toastiness
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
and
slight
hints
of
coffee
as
no
flavor
dominates
this
is
a
smooth
and
wellbalanced
stout
that
i
could
drink
several
of
in
one
sitting
head
is
giant
and
creamy
very
full
earthy
aroma
cant
help
but
noticed
something
off
is
it
alcohol
i
smell
taste
is
a
fine
mix
of
rolled
oats
and
unsweetened
chocolate
nuttiness
moves
into
a
bitter
sweet
after
taste
that
is
unrewarding
feels
fuller
in
the
mouth
than
it
looks
in
the
glass
this
was
the
first
drink
i
had
on
the
night
of
our
wedding
reception
this
was
just
what
i
needed
to
start
out
the
fabulous
night
beautiful
mollasses
black
color
with
super
fluffy
head
that
lasted
forever
the
taste
was
rich
in
toasted
nut
and
chocolate
and
finished
very
crisp
this
is
a
fantastic
and
very
smooth
tasting
oatmeal
stout
two
thumbs
up
would
get
a
higher
score
if
the
palate
didnt
mimic
the
nose
so
badly
more
roast
and
malt
flavours
would
be
good
otherwise
a
really
enjoyable
stout
the
body
is
mediumheavy
with
nice
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
at
the
start
and
finishes
creamy
and
dry
the
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
lasts
shortly
on
the
tongue
a
great
drinking
brew
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
color
with
a
small
tan
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
with
a
little
of
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
dark
roast
maybe
a
bit
smoky
flavors
again
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
they
are
not
dominant
some
alcohol
warming
detected
even
though
this
is
only
a
5
abv
beer
flavors
are
smoother
and
more
pronounced
when
letting
the
beer
warm
a
little
a
little
hop
bitterness
provides
balance
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
although
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
from
an
oatmeal
stout
but
it
still
manages
to
leave
a
thin
coating
on
the
glass
and
in
your
mouth
i
think
one
of
these
makes
a
great
dessert
someone
else
suggested
with
vanilla
ice
cream
ill
have
to
try
that
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
one
of
my
favorites
final
thought
this
is
really
hard
to
beat
one
of
the
best
beers
available
on
the
market
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
just
about
black
it
is
topped
by
a
frothy
creamy
brown
head
thick
malty
aromas
mixed
with
burnt
toast
expresso
toffee
and
chocolate
are
all
found
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
creamy
chocolately
and
slightly
viscous
i
get
notes
of
milk
chocolate
and
espresso
there
is
a
bitter
component
that
is
derived
from
the
roasted
malt
but
it
is
not
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
that
is
found
in
this
beer
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
this
beer
it
is
quite
decent
but
seems
a
little
dumbed
down
which
makes
sense
given
this
beer
wide
availibility
popularity
the
pour
although
very
dark
and
heavy
varies
from
your
average
stout
at
the
head
instead
of
the
creamy
white
head
you
get
a
fizzy
coffee
toned
volatile
one
which
emanates
scents
of
coffee
naturally
and
malt
as
well
as
some
bitterness
to
it
the
taste
was
rather
impressive
because
beyond
the
feel
of
coffee
in
it
this
beer
reminded
me
strangely
to
the
german
rauchbiers
as
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
were
strongly
smoked
with
some
meaty
taste
to
it
pleasant
certainly
but
unexpected
very
good
beer
only
major
obstacle
to
drinkability
is
cost
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
mocha
black
with
a
tan
beigh
mocha
head
that
was
a
froth
of
a
monster
very
thick
and
creamy
smell
was
very
roasted
and
smoked
not
very
oatmealgrain
at
all
to
speak
of
picked
up
a
little
wood
and
bark
smell
taste
was
of
dark
fresh
roasted
coffee
with
chocolate
fudge
the
sweet
fullbodied
creaminess
was
a
perfect
blen
with
the
subtleness
of
the
hops
full
bodied
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
flavorfully
smooth
i
would
drink
this
any
chance
i
get
great
for
after
a
meal
and
great
with
vanilla
ice
cream
if
you
like
using
your
beer
other
ways
a
lovely
offering
god
bless
england
this
stout
produces
a
fairly
good
head
with
a
nice
tanbrown
color
would
live
to
try
it
by
draught
but
the
bottle
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
nearblack
color
with
a
superthick
caramelcolored
root
beer
floatsize
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
a
good
strong
roasted
oatmeal
flavor
with
a
creamy
chocolate
malty
base
a
bit
chewy
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
a
surprisingly
high
level
of
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
caramel
finish
this
would
go
well
with
a
fine
cigar
not
the
top
of
the
oatmeal
stout
chain
but
one
of
the
better
ones
you
might
be
able
to
find
in
your
neighborhood
ah
my
first
stout
im
still
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
i
think
about
it
first
off
this
is
some
seriously
dark
beer
its
almost
pitch
black
the
aroma
is
nice
a
little
sweet
but
not
overpowering
since
this
is
my
first
stout
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
to
but
i
do
enjoy
the
taste
this
beer
starts
off
really
smooth
in
my
mouth
and
leaves
a
nice
mildly
sweet
aftertaste
overall
i
can
definently
tell
that
this
is
a
good
brew
but
im
still
not
sure
if
stout
is
a
style
that
i
really
like
ill
probably
have
to
try
this
again
with
some
food
to
see
what
happens
i
can
definently
tell
this
isnt
something
id
want
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
in
one
sitting
so
great
so
dark
this
beer
doesnt
speak
of
evil
though
so
much
flavor
im
at
a
loss
a
beer
to
try
you
must
you
will
not
be
disapointed
with
the
flavor
if
you
love
a
black
beer
it
has
so
much
more
character
than
a
stout
of
any
kind
yet
lets
you
feel
like
you
already
ate
breakfast
this
beer
is
worth
the
investment
a
great
cold
weather
friend
this
is
an
amazing
beer
drinkability
super
stuff
low
abv
i
could
drink
it
again
and
again
and
again
this
is
a
tasty
harmless
stout
but
its
light
body
and
somewhat
mild
flavor
make
me
wonder
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
i
like
it
dont
get
me
wrong
but
it
doesnt
make
much
of
a
statement
really
overall
a
very
solid
stout
and
one
i
would
definitely
enjoy
to
revisit
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
to
to
turn
people
on
to
stouts
very
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
beige
head
just
like
the
mcneills
oatmeal
stout
you
can
grab
the
oatmeal
just
by
smelling
deep
malt
profile
full
of
chocolate
licorice
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
something
powdery
alike
flour
theres
no
mistake
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
sweet
stout
with
caramelic
peaks
tons
of
oatmeal
some
powder
sugar
perhaps
and
nevertheless
a
great
balance
due
to
subdued
english
hops
silky
medium
body
highly
quaffable
definitely
the
most
obvious
definition
of
the
style
ive
faced
on
the
other
hand
it
never
comes
close
to
approaching
the
imperial
stout
in
terms
of
complexity
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
find
them
i
think
itd
go
well
with
a
roast
drinkability
they
seldom
come
any
better
than
this
if
heaven
has
beer
its
probably
a
lot
like
this
poured
a
pitch
black
with
small
tan
head
aroma
was
a
little
bit
faint
but
notes
of
malt
and
chocolate
were
notable
the
taste
is
huge
on
roasted
malts
a
smokey
chocolate
character
is
present
but
this
is
a
pretty
well
balanced
beer
no
flavors
were
too
strong
or
really
propelled
me
to
ponder
this
brew
any
further
i
can
see
this
as
a
nice
session
brew
its
a
nice
staple
to
have
close
by
at
all
times
and
its
available
in
all
types
of
places
it
would
be
on
my
must
try
list
aroma
was
not
strong
i
had
the
wrong
kind
of

but
it
was

wonderful
other

included
almost
a
meaty
quality
although
there
was
some

was
moderately
creamy
with
a
very
nice
body
and
drinkability

right
on

down
an
amazingly
quaffable

you
could
enjoy
even
in
the
heat

quite
a
brew
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
especially
those
that
enjoy
dark
beers
guinness
is
crushed
by
this
beer
and
while
i
still
enjoy
guinness
i
will
quickly
grab
the
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
anytime
im
not
usually
fond
of
stouts
but
i
definitely
would
make
an
exception
for
another
one
of
these
good
starter
beer
for
macrofreaks
but
otherwise
avoidable
except
for
dessert
settings
might
make
a
good
beer
icecream
dessert
when
i
was
a
young
associate
attorney
at
a
big
downtown
law
firm
i
loved
starbucks
coffee
when
you
are
expected
to
bill
2500
hours
a
year
a
good
caffeine
jolt
in
the
early
morning
is
great
i
realize
now
that
i
am
older
and
hopefully
wiser
that
my
starbucks
obsession
was
not
so
much
because
of
the
great
flavor
of
the
coffee
but
that
the
buzz
from
said
coffee
was
so
intense
that
it
made
it
seem
better
than
it
actually
was
add
to
that
the
fact
that
those
coffees
were
6
bucks
a
pop
and
it
really
puts
into
perspective
what
a
bunch
of
hype
and
elevated
expectations
can
do
for
a
drink
so
goes
the
ss
oatmeal
stout
the
head
on
this
beer
is
nominal
the
taste
is
ok
the
smell
is
phenomenal
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
it
will
give
you
a
good
buzz
and
tastes
delicious
the
aroma
is
fantastic
and
the
color
is
darker
than
darth
vader
i
still
think
that
its
high
listing
is
a
selffulfilling
prophecy
though
there
is
no
way
this
beer
is
better
than
chimay
pours
out
like
a
black
coca
cola
a
foamy
cream
brown
head
some
lacing
soft
aroma
of
molasses
and
roasted
malt
slightly
sharp
like
black
coffee
this
is
a
thin
stout
much
thinner
than
guiness
it
has
a
mildly
carbonated
mouthfeel
some
sweetness
and
a
mixture
of
as
they
kindly
explain
to
you
on
the
label
bakers
chocolate
and
cherries
oats
are
present
as
is
an
acidity
and
undertones
of
molasses
and
coffee
after
taste
is
earthy
mildly
guinesslike
and
softly
sweet
picked
up
a
bomber
sized
bottle
at
the
local
grocery
store
for
2
79
this
black
beer
poured
a
fine
head
that
left
a
nice
lacing
down
my
22
oz
glass
very
sweet
smelling
for
a
stout
this
is
an
extremely
smooth
stout
very
interesting
and
complex
the
oatmeal
must
make
it
smooth
the
mothfeel
wasnt
as
thick
as
advertised
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
one
i
have
had
on
and
off
over
the
years
this
is
a
beer
that
eats
like
a
meal
wow
this
is
a
filling
brew
over
all
for
me
it
is
a
classic
and
another
fantastic
offering
from
samuel
smiths
this
brew
is
what
i
use
to
judge
all
other
oatmeal
stouts
by
simply
fantastic
the
pour
into
my
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
glass
reveals
this
beer
to
be
dark
dark
black
with
a
nice
thick
dark
head
it
smells
sweet
with
hints
of
caramelbutterscotch
but
without
being
too
overbearing
the
sweet
flavor
is
yummy
its
not
syrupy
but
there
is
a
roasted
taste
with
caramel
notes
and
a
definite
dry
roasted
aftertaste
with
the
lingering
sweetness
following
at
the
very
end
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
still
good
carbonation
does
not
get
in
the
way
but
complements
the
roasted
finish
this
one
goes
down
well
i
could
drink
it
all
night
i
was
excited
about
trying
this
too
but
ended
up
being
disappointed
the
smell
was
strong
of
vinegar
and
slight
fruit
cherries
behind
it
taste
was
good
very
complex
for
a
stout
but
too
influence
by
the
smell
maybe
another
bad
bottle
for
me
i
dont
know
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
at
better
prices
drinkabilityi
really
enjoy
this
beeri
would
describe
it
as
a
nice
sipping
beergreat
on
a
cold
night
also
this
is
probably
the
best
stout
i
have
tried
i
like
it
much
more
than
guiness
if
you
like
stouts
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
pours
pitch
black
but
not
as
thick
as
some
of
its
counterparts
a
nice
beefy
dark
tan
head
with
noticeable
carbonation
smells
almost
chocolately
tastes
delicious
with
a
chocolate
but
not
too
dark
taste
this
beer
goes
down
so
smooth
i
could
drink
maybe
2
or
3
of
these
but
they
are
quite
filling
so
i
would
prefer
to
savour
each
one
a
fantastic
beer
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
large
clear
bottle
pours
black
with
a
manly
dark
tan
head
ecxellent
head
retention
and
nice
foamy
lacing
sweet
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
smooth
malt
toasted
malt
and
burnt
malt
chocolate
cafe
au
lait
and
cocoa
notes
some
chalky
hops
in
the
finish
smooth
silky
coating
mouthfeel
this
one
is
wonderful
to
savor
and
enjoy
i
enjoyed
some
spicy
bbq
chicken
and
a
piece
or
two
of
chocolate
with
this
one
a
fine
brew
go
out
and
get
some
poured
out
ink
black
with
some
decent
amount
of
head
on
this
beer
gotta
be
careful
with
those
gold
wrappings
around
the
cap
a
little
piece
fell
into
my
beer
smell
consisted
of
some
sweet
malts
chocolate
coffee
and
some
creaminess
of
some
sorts
taste
is
very
good
so
silky
smooth
and
creamy
almost
like
buttery
chocolate
in
your
mouth
its
so
good
this
beer
barely
had
a
chance
to
get
to
room
temperature
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
its
true
what
the
others
say
this
is
an
amazing
beer
always
keep
a
4
pack
of
this
beer
in
your
fridgecellar
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
this
stout
pouts
as
black
as
night
there
is
a
thick
large
bubble
foam
head
the
head
last
for
aroma
time
and
dwindles
down
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
and
sticky
hints
of
coffee
and
molasses
are
present
along
with
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
leaving
a
smooth
feeling
across
the
pallet
the
sweetness
of
the
molasses
comes
across
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
sweet
finish
one
fine
brew
cant
understand
why
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
one
paired
interestingly
with
young
french
brie
cheese
it
seemed
to
bring
out
the
hardness
of
the
water
and
add
a
metallic
sourish
tinge
to
the
taste
the
earthiness
of
the
brie
brought
out
the
sweet
fruitiness
of
the
yeast
and
malts
great
beer
great
nose
little
funky
lots
of
character
kinda
leathery
but
more
appealing
than
that
good
rich
flavor
a
bit
funky
really
satisfying
good
chocolate
malt
flavor
with
the
rich
earthy
funk
really
make
this
beer
enjoyable
could
be
a
little
sweeter
or
something
to
up
the
mouthfeel
but
other
than
that
i
really
enjoy
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
frothy
tan
head
forms
on
top
of
a
barely
translucent
dark
mahogany
liquid
the
head
was
impressively
sized
and
showed
good
staying
power
nice
strong
aroma
mainly
of
heavy
dark
malts
and
the
taste
echos
that
with
the
hearty
taste
associated
with
those
grains
an
aftertaste
lingers
of
chocolate
with
a
slight
undertone
of
coffee
as
well
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
stout
poured
beautifully
nice
dark
black
provides
a
23
finger
head
nice
and
soapy
head
lasts
a
good
while
when
held
up
to
light
produces
a
nice
redbrown
smells
like
molasses
cookies
sweet
but
not
overpowering
medium
mouthfeel
surprisingly
not
too
heavy
but
assertive
strong
molasses
taste
but
hops
keep
sweetness
in
check
great
beer
could
definitely
put
a
few
back
if
it
were
just
a
little
less
expensive
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
thick
and
black
with
a
tan
head
i
alway
think
of
it
as
a
grownups
guinness
it
has
a
wonderful
roasty
taste
that
is
almost
overpowering
but
falls
short
and
disappears
into
a
smooth
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
milk
stouts
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
longer
than
any
other
craft
beer
and
it
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
it
feels
appropriately
thick
and
rich
and
really
just
satisfying
i
dont
think
any
stout
lover
would
have
difficulty
putting
quite
a
few
of
these
away
super
drinkable
i
dont
normally
really
like
stout
beer
this
brew
changed
my
point
of
view
on
this
style
of
beer
poured
into
my
glass
to
produce
a
giant
creamy
head
i
had
a
pavlovian
response
almost
immediately
the
beer
had
a
deep
mahogany
appearance
with
maybe
a
bit
of
red
coloring
if
the
light
hit
it
just
so
smell
was
inviting
a
warm
malt
smell
and
some
dark
fruit
smells
on
top
the
flavor
was
beautifully
full
and
maintains
dimension
without
being
overly
complex
there
is
a
wonderul
sweetness
that
accompanies
this
beer
the
roof
of
my
mouth
hummed
with
bitter
while
the
tongue
smiled
in
sweetness
great
beer
but
what
else
can
we
expect
from
sammy
smith
chocolate
brown
dense
and
sticky
body
that
is
not
quite
opaque
with
ruby
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
thick
tall
khaki
head
formed
easily
and
receded
to
a
quarter
inch
thick
layer
of
bubbles
on
top
of
the
beer
wonderful
lacing
and
head
retention
and
medium
carbonation
smells
like
lightly
roasted
grains
caramel
and
honey
flowery
hops
with
very
mild
bitterness
taste
leans
definitely
towards
toward
the
fruity
sweet
end
of
the
spectrum
with
a
mixture
of
plums
raisins
and
cherries
warming
and
soothing
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
a
bit
thinner
than
most
stouts
a
restrained
sweet
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
bottle

poured
a
pitchblack
brew
with
a
nice
dark
foamy
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
linger
of
maltness
taste
is
very
sweet
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
no
strong
aftertaste
or
bitterness
this
is
a
very
creamy
easy
beer
you
can
go
wrong
with
that
oatmeal
stout
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
the
drinkability
is
great
yeah
its
roasted
like
most
stouts
are
but
the
oatmeal
makes
it
so
smooth
you
can
just
sit
back
relax
and
enjoy
this
one
lots
of
sweet
roasted
malt
in
this
baby
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
just
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
to
finish
clear
clean
chocolate
and
coffee
flavours
make
this
a
wonderfully
toothsome
beer
good
intro
for
a
newbie
stout
drinker
overall
a
wonderful
oatmeal
stout
a
must
try
velvety
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
has
that
distinct
sam
smith
sweet
yeast
smell
along
with
sweet
roasted
malts
taste
is
smooth
moderately
sweet
with
mellow
roasted
malts
throughout
also
some
fruitiness
like
all
ss
beers
delicious
good
smooth
feel
if
maybe
a
tad
watery
very
drinkable
i
just
wish
it
was
cheaper
this
is
supremely
drinkable
beer
that
im
enjoying
immensely
heres
the
short
version
of
this
review
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
is
a
widely
available
easy
drinking
delicious
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
is
one
that
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
beer
fridge
the
drinkability
is
this
stouts
weak
link
in
my
humble
estimation
certainly
something
to
nurse
for
a
while
and
enjoy
the
nuances
of
as
it
warms
top
of
the
line
oatmeal
stout
not
as
chewy
and
more
drinkable
thant
st
ambroise
dark
brown
with
sudsy
head
drink
your
oatmeal
taste
is
strong
inyouface
almost
thought
it
was
a
higher
alcohol
content
nice
with
my
roast
beef
lunch
had
a
second
almost
two
years
later
and
my
mates
didnt
like
it
but
i
liked
understated
stout
taste
i
picked
up
the
bomber
at
the
eats
ave
wegmans
it
poured
a
deep
black
colour
with
the
perfect
head
of
a
dark
tan
hue
the
smell
was
of
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
bit
of
hops
the
taste
was
wonderful
with
the
taste
of
chocolate
ant
coffee
being
the
strongest
part
of
it
there
was
also
hints
of
roasted
grains
and
malts
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
were
also
added
were
i
could
taste
them
but
not
too
much
it
went
down
smooth
maybe
too
smooth
because
i
want
more
the
beer
pours
as
dark
as
a
moon
less
night
black
as
a
raven
darker
than
the
inside
of
a
cow
i
think
you
get
the
picture
head
is
bunyanesque
in
size
spumous
in
texture
and
a
toothsome
light
tan
in
color
as
it
ever
so
slowly
dematerializes
the
resultant
lace
a
thick
and
glutinous
blanket
to
obscure
the
glass
ah
that
smell
rich
sweet
malt
toasted
grains
coffee
earthy
sweet
milk
chocolate
a
treat
for
the
ocular
and
olfactory
sense
start
is
ambrosial
and
rich
in
malt
with
the
top
middling
in
feel
finish
is
benignly
carbonated
the
hops
delectable
and
the
aftertaste
a
blend
of
malts
hops
and
toasted
grains
quite
dry
and
pleasant
a
long
time
favorite
stout
that
never
fails
to
please
and
one
that
always
occupies
my
dbf
looks
like
most
other
stouts
near
pitch
black
opaque
liquid
with
a
tan
head
the
flavor
really
blows
me
away
huge
coffee
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
this
is
maybe
the
most
flavorful
stout
i
have
come
across
definitely
a
dessert
beer
that
i
could
not
even
think
about
sessioning
this
is
one
that
has
a
lot
going
on
and
improves
as
it
warms
john
if
only
it
were
socially
acceptable
to
drink
your
breakfast
this
would
replace
eggs
and
bacon
or
scrapple
for
me
its
just
sweet
enough
to
be
a
treat
with
plenty
of
peripheral
notes
to
intrigue
the
palate
its
full
and
earthy
never
cloying
and
so
wonderfully
refreshing
despite
its
considerable
heft
the
lower
abv
helps
make
it
delightfully
fresh
and
drinkable
balck
wonderful
brew
with
nice
foamy
tan
head
that
falls
to
nice
tan
ring
following
the
beer
down
smells
of
roasted
malts
oats
good
earthy
smelling
brew
of
substance
taste
is
perfect
roasted
malt
sweet
oats
with
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
carmel
and
more
sweet
wonderful
brew
with
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
to
bring
eveything
together
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
great
you
could
almost
live
on
this
beer
alone
my
favorite
stout
as
of
present
cant
imagine
getting
much
better
then
this
why
cant
all
beer
be
this
good
pours

a

99
for
a
4pack
of
12oz
also
3
for
a
550ml
bottle
from
northend
superette
manchester
nh
the
aroma
was
pleasant
and
the
taste
was
amazing
overall
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
perhaps
a
bit
overpriced
at
least
in
my
local
market
well
done
ill
definitely
be
having
more
of
this
in
the
future
overall
this
surprised
me
with
its
mellowness
and
drinkability
this
is
a
myriad
of
flavors
and
textures
and
to
anybody
who
says
they
dont
like
beer
i
would
point
them
toward
this
one
a
classic
taste
didnt
wow
me
to
the
level
that
this
beer
is
ranked
good
to
be
sure
smooth
dark
toast
mingles
with
a
more
subdued
roasty
malt
flavor
on
the
sweet
side
and
finishes
with
another
hint
of
marshmallow
only
mild
bitter
tones
as
the
glass
warms
to
room
temperature
a
little
too
thin
and
mild
mannered
i
like
stouts
to
be
heavy
chewy
and
assertive
this
meets
none
of
those
criteria
i
am
a
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
and
this
one
an
all
around
good
stout
i
highly
recommend
it
the
taste
is
great
and
unlike
some
beers
you
can
spend
your
time
on
it
without
it
tasting
awful
on
the
last
bit
as
a
stout
lover
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
looks
very
dark
and
rich
in
flavor
an
off
white
creamy
head
full
of
complex
aromas
alcholic
and
sweet
are
the
two
that
stand
out
to
me
very
rich
tasting
but
much
lighter
than
other
stouts
ive
had
it
starts
off
very
rich
and
creamy
and
finishs
slightly
dry
an
excellent
beer
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
about
this
stout
was
the
aroma
very
complex
almost
sweet
with
what
i
thought
could
have
been
vanilla
among
other
things
the
1
surprise
was
the
texture
and
consistency
of
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
much
thicker
more
like
guiness
and
boy
was
i
surprised
a
much
smoother
lighter
consistency
with
a
great
taste
and
just
enough
flavor
to
let
you
know
you
are
drinking
something
quality
without
being
over
whelming
it
took
me
more
time
to
get
a
good
overall
sense
of
this
stout
then
i
would
have
expected
a
compliment
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
i
find
it
hard
to
rate
any
stouts
higher
than
this
not
a
session
brew
but
very
nice
for
dining
looks
nice
with
a
fluffy
lightbrown
head
smells
pretty
funky
some
plasticity
and
acidity
flavor
starts
nice
enough
although
too
sweet
for
my
liking
good
molasses
in
there
with
the
roasted
grains
finish
is
pretty
bad
kind
of
like
what
i
think
varnish
would
taste
like
although
i
admire
the
distinctness
of
this
brew
and
its
fermentation
flavors
i
find
it
to
be
very
unpleasant
poor
aroma
and
poor
finish
how
is
this
rated
so
high
i
would
like
to
see
peoples
thoughts
on
this
in
blind
taste
tests
so
that
there
is
no
bias
towards
this
popular
brewery
i
had
this
a
few
nights
ago
at
a
tavern
in
the
355
ml
bottle
and
wasnt
impressed
old
musty
excessively
yeasty
but
i
decided
to
give
it
another
shot
for
this
review
and
picked
up
a
550
ml
bottle
from
a
different
establishment
so
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
basically
black
at
the
center
rosewoodchestnut
highlights
appear
when
brew
is
held
to
light
not
much
of
a
head
on
first
pour
just
a
thin
film
of
foam
a
more
vigorous
pouring
on
the
second
attempt
revealed
an
offwhite
to
tan
dusky
head
about
two
fingers
deep
that
eventually
settled
slightly
and
the
aroma
what
a
difference
there
was
between
this
bottle
and
my
previous
sample
so
much
fresher
with
a
pleasant
smell
of
fresh
bread
rolled
oats
and
a
raisiny
touch
up
front
sustained
by
a
pervasive
cream
sherry
sweetness
throughout
the
flavor
continues
the
trend
more
distinct
cream
sherry
tones
accompany
a
dark
almost
pumpernickel
oatmealy
midpalate
while
remaining
subtle
and
light
suggestions
of
black
bread
prunes
and
puffed
wheat
cereal
round
everything
out
punctuated
by
a
bit
of
english
hop
dryness
near
perfect
mouthfeel
creamy
and
light
stunningly
silky
and
smooth
but
also
tingly
dry
and
warming
almost
distributes
itself
across
the
palate
without
you
even
trying
nowhere
near
the
density
i
expected
from
such
mealy
flavors
and
aromas
drinkability
is
hampered
if
you
can
call
it
that
only
because
the
brew
is
deeply
satiating
and
fillinga
beer
to
be
savored
and
slowly
digesteda
bottle
at
a
time
will
be
enough
tasty
soothing
recommended
drinkability
obviously
a
tremendous
stout
the
oatmeal
takes
some
of
the
more
exciting
stout
edges
off
imo
but
if
this
is
all
i
can
find
to
complain
about
im
in
heaven
one
word
comes
to
mind
when
i
drink
this
brew
smoothe
this
beer
poures
a
dark
dark
brown
with
just
a
little
light
being
able
to
sneak
through
the
edges
and
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
down
to
the
last
drop
the
smell
has
hints
of
roasted
toffee
and
carmel
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
scent
as
well
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
not
only
is
is
the
smoothest
stout
you
could
ask
for
it
tastes
just
as
it
smells
with
a
carmel
toffee
and
coffee
flavor
but
with
just
the
right
ammount
of
sweetness
to
round
it
out
this
is
a
great
dark
beer
to
give
someone
to
introduce
them
to
the
stoutporter
style
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
one
and
i
had
forgotten
how
wonderful
this
beer
is
the
usual
complaints
about
the
clear
bottles
not
withstanding
samuel
smith
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
while
not
my
favorite
from
them
this
one
is
still
a
top
notch
brew
as
has
been
mentioned
before
this
is
great
intro
stout
for
those
looking
to
delve
into
the
style
poured
from
a
clear
12
oz
bottle
quite
a
surprise
to
find
the
bottle
clear
but
the
top
is
foil
wrapped
and
the
pour
is
a
very
dark
brown
thick
beige
head
eventually
calms
down
to
reveal
a
bit
of
the
cherry
color
on
the
outside
rim
that
was
noted
by
some
other
reviewers
dont
know
where
that
cherry
hue
comes
from
but
it
makes
for
an
exceptional
appearance
dark
malts
and
chocolate
dominate
the
nose
but
there
are
hints
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
cooked
oatmeal
smooth
full
bodied
and
filling
in
the
mouth
taste
is
of
a
well
balanced
stout
that
ehoes
the
nose
very
tasty
i
took
my
time
with
this
one
because
its
just
too
good
to
finishits
my
only
one
one
of
the
best
that
ive
reviewed
my
only
complaint
is
a
somewhat
unpleasant
syrupy
aftertaste
but
i
guess
that
goes
with
the
territory
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
of
these
i
like
oatmeal
stouts
and
english
brews
so
a
quality
oatmeal
stout
like
this
is
very
seductive
to
my
senses
and
perspective
as
well
as
my
sense
of
perspective
drinkability
world
class
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stout
sin
the
world
hands
down
overall
impression
hard
to
figure
how
such
a
heavy
rich
tasting
beer
comes
off
as
light
and
refreshing
this
is
an
excellent
beer
all
around
and
a
personal
favorite
but
that
odd
metallic
bottoming
out
spot
is
a
bit
distracting
it
may
be
due
to
my
unorthodox
storage
or
i
may
have
let
this
one
go
a
bit
longer
than
i
should
have
beautiful
balance
wonderful
quality
chugability
just
about
everything
you
could
want
in
a
beer
scratches
every
beer
itch
i
have
strongly
recommended
not
a
chugging
or
partying
beer
i
bought
a
550ml
bottle
for
2
99
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
much
like
the
imperial
stout
much
sweeter
taste
less
fruiter
than
the
imperial
which
tasted
like
raisins
this
is
sweet
yet
subtle
in
the
oatmeal
flavor
a
very
dark
malt
is
present
in
this
one
i
drink
it
alot
at
phish
concerts
and
it
is
a
favortie
choice
at
home
i
do
like
the
imperiral
stout
more
however
this
stout
has
a
sharp
bite
to
it
with
the
mild
stouty
oat
flavor
delicious
to
drink
for
sampling
and
for
those
friday
nights
its
flavor
is
different
than
other
oatmeals
and
is
more
highly
recommended
for
those
wanting
to
try
an
oatmeal
it
captures
the
essence
of
oatmeals
without
the
taste
disappearing
due
to
nitrous
cans
i
could
consider
this
a
comfort
beer
im
going
to
miss
it
when
it
is
gone
highly
recommended
this
is
a
great
beer
very
complex
and
tasty
but
i
think
its
a
little
overhyped
what
can
i
say
about
this
one
that
hasnt
already
been
said
i
will
add
a
few
things
that
stand
out
in
my
mind
increadible
silky
mouthfeel
i
find
it
to
have
a
smoked
or
chared
malt
flavor
to
it
as
venom
stated
but
also
some
really
peaty
undertones
like
a
scotish
ale
also
did
notice
a
red
wine
finish
in
its
dryness
awesome
any
way
you
slice
it
ah
this
puts
most
other
oatmeal
stouts
to
shame
smooth
silky
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
coming
through
with
a
light
hop
touch
to
keep
you
looking
for
another
i
enjoyed
this
with
some
steamers
on
a
recent
night
out
in
fact
i
enjoyed
two
nothing
over
the
top
about
this
beer
just
plain
fantastic
notes
six
thumbs
up
the
thing
that
really
got
me
about
this
beer
was
its
aftertaste
that
lingers
and
transforms
from
one
great
thing
into
another
maybe
more
experienced
beer
lovers
get
that
from
alot
of
differant
beers
but
for
me
it
was
the
first
time
another
thing
a
like
about
this
beer
is
its
drinkablity
tons
of
flavor
but
light
in
the
mouth
and
in
the
stomach
im
used
to
drinking
guiness
extra
stout
for
my
stout
fix
this
beer
is
a
welcomed
change
i
have
to
fall
in
line
with
just
about
everyone
else
on
this
one
the
tempting
darkness
of
the
brew
is
gothicly
beautiful
as
is
the
teasing
carmel
oatmeal
aroma
sweet
carmelly
aste
floats
right
with
you
for
the
entire
glass
bitterness
never
showed
its
face
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
little
to
high
charged
but
that
just
made
it
a
thirst
quencher
instead
of
just
a
sipping
beer
notes
exceptional
stout
and
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
find
it
drink
it
and
sing
its
praises
its
that
good
and
should
appeal
to
almost
every
type
of
beer
drinker
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
you
should
already
be
on
your
way
to
the
store
probably
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
ever
tried
perfect
balance
excellent
flavor
absolutely
world
class
this
oatmeal
stout
poured
thick
into
the
glass
thick
and
heavy
when
the
glass
settled
i
could
see
the
thick
black
smoke
like
body
and
the
supper
chunky
tan
head
the
head
kind
of
slithered
down
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
was
almost
a
meal
in
itself
the
almost
spice
aroma
jumped
up
and
bit
me
the
first
sip
was
almost
heavy
it
was
thick
and
full
of
flavor
rich
malty
with
just
a
hit
of
bitter
balanced
out
well
the
finish
was
almost
dry

little
to
heavy

so
its
not

next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
oatmeal
stout
this
is
my
choice
drinkability
more
please
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
tasted
wish
there
was
more
than
one
other
oatmeal
stout
in
maine
to
compare
it
with
damn
good
beer
drank
this
delicious
offering
with
a
rib
eye
and
some
fresh
veggies
from
the
farmers
market
here
in
chicago
on
a
beautiful
early
september
day
and
it
was
like
matching
a
fine
wine
with
food
from
the
get
go
this
beer
showed
its
colors
deep
nearly
black
with
red
tones
around
the
edges
the
smell
and
taste
made
me
think
of
oatmeal
chocolate
chip
cookies
that
i
baked
as
a
kid
the
mouthfeel
was
velvety
creamy
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
taste
wise
i
found
ample
stoutlike
qualitieschocolate
mocha
etc
yet
this
one
had
that
oatmeal
thing
going
that
perhaps
gave
it
the
complexity
to
make
it
just
a
bit
more
unique
that
other
stouts
i
thought
this
to
be
a
very
rewarding
food
beer
and
recommend
it
for
that
next
rib
eye
off
the
grill
baeutiful
creamy
head
with
exceptional
sticky
lacing
smell
had
an
alcohol
aroma
with
smoky
undertones
taste
a
nice
complex
blend
of
fruity
smoky
ingredients
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
sense
of
alcohol
for
a
5
0
abv
medium
chewy
mouthfeel
that
invites
you
to
sip
not
guzzle
not
my
very
favorite
but
for
the
type
an
excellent
offering
love
it
when
the
hops
are
minimal
this
is
the
one
that
restarted
the
style
if
you
can
buy
this
straight
out
of
the
case
it
will
be
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
you
will
ever
drink
it
has
been
sitting
in
a
sixpack
or
loose
spend
your
money
elsewhere
pours
dark
black
with
very
little
head
and
that
distinctive
oatmeal
smell
upon
tasting
that
oatmeal
is
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
and
malty
and
i
noticed
a
burnt
peanutty
taste
yes
its
a
dark
stout
but
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
had
this
with
my
dessert
and
it
was
a
fantastic
finish
to
my
meal
i
suspect
it
works
well
with
most
sweet
foods
overall
an
excellent
beer
simply
the
best
oatmeal
stout
out
there
so
rich
and
delicious
that
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
overall
its
just
such
an
amazing
beer
like
a
backwoods
country
stout
earth
fruit
smoke
and
soft
dark
sugary
malts
no
wonder
its
so
popular
among
phishheads
a
great
beer
i
think
the
best
of
the
oatmeal
stouts
out
therepours
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
tan
colored
head
that
sticks
very
well
the
aroma
is
very
much
like
brown
sugar
and
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
also
has
a
brown
sugar
taste
but
a
little
more
subdued
with
a
nice
roasted
coffee
taste
ending
nice
and
soft
drinking
this
beer
is
a
beer
lovers
experience
a
very
tasty
beer
bought
a
bottle
at
huckleberrys
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
smelled
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
taste
was
a
velvety
smooth
dollup
of
mildly
toasted
malt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
finishing
with
a
slight
hoppyness
accompanied
by
a
mildly
raisiny
taste
mouthfeel
is
not
as
creamy
as
say
a
guinness
but
still
nice
this
beer
is
initially
easy
to
drink
but
one
winds
up
slowing
down
because
its
very
filling
otherwise
id
give
higher
marks
for
drinkability
im
currently
rethinking
my
plan
to
go
out
and
scare
up
a
dinner
its
too
hot
to
cook
right
now
in
spokane
this
was
my
first
oatmeal
stout
i
am
always
weary
of
the
clear
bottles
from
samuel
smith
this
poured
a
dark
dark
dark
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
was
nice
and
full
the
taste
was
the
same
between
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
and
their
imperial
stout
you
can
have
breakfast
and
dinner
oatmeal
for
breaksfast
and
imperial
for
dinner
a
beautiful
brew
from
sam
smith
surprise
surprise
this
guy
is
black
very
black
in
the
glass
a
nice
looking
but
slight
tan
head
caps
it
off
smell
is
of
slight
roasty
coffeeespresso
but
is
not
overwhelming
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smells
with
possible
hints
of
chocolate
added
to
the
mix
as
with
the
smell
not
too
strong
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
is
delightful
very
smooth
milky
and
creamy
on
the
palate
only
reason
its
not
a
5
in
my
book
is
that
it
could
be
just
slightly
thicker
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
among
the
very
best
of
stouts
in
my
opinion
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
day
pours
out
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
biscuit
sized
brown
sticky
head
aromas
of
malt
roasted
coffee
and
caramelsoemthing
sweet
come
through
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
nice
malt
flavour
hints
of
coffee
come
through
with
some
caramelbuttery
toffee
and
something
i
cant
quit
place
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
and
not
too
thickm
just
right
with
the
pefect
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
because
its
just
so
damn
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
slightly
sweet
flavor
is
something
i
love
and
the
somewhat
normallow
abv
keeps
you
from
stumbling
around
after
a
few
when
your
in
the
right
mood
morning
desert
night
cap
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
didnt
detect
much
aroma
in
this
beer
it
has
a
fairly
benign
taste
not
bad
but
nothing
special
ill
have
to
rerate
this
one
at
some
point
i
just
wish
it
came
in
a
4
pack
or
hell
even
a
6
pack
this
beer
poured
a
tan
head
with
smallmedium
sized
bubbles
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
brown
and
there
was
fair
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
nose
was
hoppy
with
this
beer
and
it
had
a
smooth
mouthfeel
which
is
much
to
my
liking
a
good
stout
in
my
opinion
edit
i
have
had
this
one
a
few
times
recently
and
it
has
definitely
become
one
of
my
favorites
also
the
oatmeal
taste
is
more
prevalent
now
i
upped
my
ratings
to
correspond
with
how
i
feel
about
this
stout
now
beautifiul
frothy
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
lace
on
my
glass
sitting
atop
a
completely
black
beer
aroma
is
of
creamy
oats
with
a
slight
noble
hop
accent
flavor
is
of
carmel
malt
and
roast
barley
with
a
thick
oatmeal
finish
highlighted
by
a
slight
noble
hop
balance
the
body
is
heavy
yet
this
beer
finishes
with
a
malty
sweetness
very
nice
stout
that
is
not
sour
like
guinness
but
rather
it
is
creamy
flavorful
and
sweet
overall
a
really
enjoyable
experience
one
of
my
favorites
to
summarize
this
maybe
isnt
my
absolute
favourite
stout
but
in
all
the
stouts
ive
had
this
one
strikes
the
balance
between
amazing
quality
and
popular
drinkability
that
is
i
think
most
of
my
friends
would
be
a
little
overwhelmed
by
say
shakespeare
stout
but
theyd
really
appreciate
this
one
and
here
is
the
always
yummy
sammy
smiths
oatmeal
this
is
the
first
stout
other
than
guinness
that
i
ever
tried
its
the
first
beer
that
got
me
into
drinking
better
beer
i
owe
this
beer
a
lot
its
the
best
beer
to
come
out
of
a
clear
bottle
thats
for
sure
nowadays
id
have
to
say
i
prefer
the
imperial
stout
offering
by
sammy
smiths
but
this
is
one
stout
i
will
always
fall
back
upon
and
enjoy
thoroughly
its
damn
near
opaque
with
a
wellretaining
tan
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
burnt
chocolate
malt
faint
coffee
sweetness
and
hops
same
goes
with
the
flavor
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
has
a
buttery
if
slightly
thin
but
still
thick
enough
for
a
stout
mouthfeel
and
its
creamy
drinkable
as
all
hell
i
only
prefer
the
imperial
because
im
on
a
robust
kick
but
this
stout
is
truly
amazing
and
has
never
let
me
down
the
clear
bottle
has
always
scared
me
but
its
always
fresh
when
i
buy
it
this
brew
has
a
mild
hoppy
malt
aroma
invigorated
pour
with
a
light
brown
head
of
small
to
medium
bubbles
and
a
opaque
dark
brown
body
with
a
receding
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
it
has
a
surprisingly
smooth
flavor
with
very
subtle
taste
hard
to
place
the
flavor
but
it
went
down
very
easily
and
was
very
much
to
my
liking
truly
a
wonderful
brew
and
a
well
crafted
stout
two
pints
up
as
others
have
said
whats
with
the
clear
glass
bottle
poured
a
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
chocolate
head
that
slowly
receded
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
however
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
sweet
from
the
malt
with
some
coffee
but
little
else
not
bad
but
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
overall
it
was
still
enjoyable
from
the
clear
bottle
pours
forth
a
black
beer
with
a
light
tan
to
light
brown
head
which
is
composed
of
many
tiny
bubbles
and
diminishes
somewhat
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
not
particularly
strong
but
inviting
the
taste
is
wonderful
and
full
of
many
flavors
including
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
coffee
a
taste
similar
to
sherry
also
comes
through
especially
in
the
dry
finish
very
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
despite
being
a
medium
to
heavy
bodied
beer
the
beer
pours
black
witha
full
tan
head
that
is
well
retained
the
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
there
is
something
in
it
that
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
maybe
its
the
yeast
or
an
aromatic
specialty
grain
the
taste
is
excellant
a
good
stout
with
that
oatmeal
flavor
chocolate
malts
overpower
me
in
a
good
way
it
is
such
a
balanced
ale
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
medheavy
body
but
a
real
drinkable
beer
a
low
abv
5
means
that
many
can
be
had
without
getting
too
loose
another
great
brew
from
this
respected
brewery
ok
now
im
finished
with
beer
in
clear
glass
this
one
was
slightly
skunked
as
well
ill
never
make
another
attempt
at
this
looks
nice
dark
with
foamy
head
aroma
is
sadly
tainted
same
with
flavor
although
not
as
bad
as
the
nutbrown
i
had
earler
good
mouthfeel
and
probably
a
good
hopped
stout
maybe
ill
plan
a
trip
to
england
and
try
this
one
on
draught
the
only
other
time
i
drank
this
beer
i
had
it
in
comparison
with
sammys
imperial
it
is
not
as
malty
or
subtantial
and
isnt
supposed
to
be
i
tried
it
again
tonight
and
although
it
still
comes
across
as
somewhat
mild
for
a
stout
it
has
a
nice
well
balanced
taste
terrific
appearance
in
the
glass
with
a
large
foamy
head
i
still
prefer
the
imperial
but
this
is
a
very
smooth
enjoyable
beer
as
stated
earlier
i
am
not
much
of
a
stout
drinker
so
i
would
humbly
categorize
this
as
a
beginners
stout
and
as
a
beginning
stout
drinker
i
am
looking
to
move
to
something
a
little
deeper
and
with
more
character
a
very
nice
dark
stout
that
when
held
to
light
i
only
imagine
that
theres
a
little
reddishbrown
color
around
the
outsides
of
the
glass
i
light
tan
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
and
left
a
nice
sticky
lace
down
the
sides
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
bitterchocolate
nice
and
creamy
with
a
very
clean
finish
and
with
only
5
abv
this
is
one
that
i
can
drink
all
night
the
only
reason
that
i
left
room
for
improvement
in
my
score
is
that
its
not
glbc
ohio
city
i
had
this
beer
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
style
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
black
with
2
fingers
of
dark
tan
head
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
roasted
coffee
maybe
the
taste
is
very
sweet
not
hoppy
at
all
almost
a
mix
of
toffee
and
coffee
in
this
nice
sweet
finish
that
is
just
great
the
mouthfeel
is
very
strong
i
love
it
the
drinkability
is
a
little
low
for
a
5
0
great
stout
though
that
i
will
enjoy
again
soon
which
is
by
no
means
an
exemplar
of
the
style
just
a
starting
point
a
fine
specimen
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
pours
a
light
ink
black
in
color
with
a
two
finger
foamy
head
aroma
of
burnt
malts
and
some
chocolate
sweet
and
creamy
slippery
smooth
somewhat
acidic
and
smokey
some
dark
roast
coffee
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
leaves
you
yearning
for
more
incredible
stout
should
own
its
own
category
the
sweet
toffee
smell
is
echoed
in
the
front
of
the
beer
the
middle
is
sweet
and
malty
just
a
little
oily
just
a
touch
of
smoky
coffee
shows
up
in
the
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
its
almost
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
though
it
dries
a
little
and
gets
creamier
with
temperature
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
foamy
brown
head
the
head
lingers
a
bit
and
leaves
but
produces
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
but
then
throws
in
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
with
nuances
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
wellbalanced
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
these
guys
just
make
really
good
stuf
i
could
drink
this
all
night
black
as
night
only
small
amount
of
red
shows
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
loads
of
lacing
well
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
fine
beer
very
nice
sweet
taste
the
hops
are
there
if
youre
looking
otherwise
they
complement
the
beer
very
nicely
this
shaint
be
the
last
of
these
that
i
consume
pours
with
a
thick
creamy
head
head
settles
nicely
extremely
dark
brown
smells
oaty
some
nuts
too
well
rounded
complex
but
soothing
taste
toasted
oats
are
obvious
but
not
over
the
top
slight
pleasant
aftertaste
very
drinkable
i
could
go
a
night
drinking
only
this
i
am
glad
that
this
bottle
wasnt
skunked
as
it
is
very
enjoyable
probably
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
4
samuel
smith
brews
i
have
had
this
evening
this
should
be
given
to
anyone
who
thinks
that
all
stouts
taste
like
guinness
black
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
i
found
little
to
know
aroma
at
all
this
is
its
only
downfall
the
taste
though
is
fantastic
its
a
very
robust
molasses
like
taste
that
lingers
on
my
tongue
for
quite
some
time
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
it
goes
down
smooth
certaintly
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
and
definitely
drinkable
but
not
one
that
i
will
order
again
tasted
nice
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
color
head
is
steady
tan
in
color
a
slight
skunky
smell
taints
the
aroma
the
skunk
dissipates
or
the
senses
acclimatize
but
the
nose
is
faint
only
with
a
vigorous
swirl
is
there
any
aroma
generated
sweetish
oatmeal
and
some
chocolate
notes
are
detected
many
of
the
characteristics
of
the
aroma
are
noted
in
the
taste
and
are
a
bit
more
pronounced
body
is
light
mouthfeel
smooth
and
drinkable
a
slightly
above
average
oatmeal
stout
imho
what
can
i
say
but
holy
freakin
cow
this
is
one
absolutely
smooth
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
topped
off
by
an
incredibly
thick
and
creamy
head
head
retains
itself
for
the
entire
duration
leaving
a
thin
sticky
coating
of
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
full
of
roasted
oats
toffee
and
mild
nutty
undertones
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
mildly
sweet
and
very
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
total
smoothness
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
any
lover
of
fine
stouts
this
oatmeal
stout
poured
a
very
very
deep
amber
almost
black
it
was
clear
when
held
to
a
light
the
ample
dark
tan
head
held
on
for
the
entire
time
it
took
to
drink
the
clear
550
ml
bottle
the
roasted
aroma
was
muted
but
very
nice
the
roasted
flavor
grabbed
my
tongue
it
semi
sweet
taste
lingered
long
after
the
liquid
was
swallowed
there
was
almost
a
wee
heavy
aspect
of
the
roasted
and
chocolate
combination
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
clung
to
my
tongue
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
after
hearing
about
this
for
a
long
time
i
finally
tried
it
wow
this
is
good
stuff
pours
black
with
a
large
dark
creamy
head
taste
is
very
malty
with
chocolate
accents
not
a
boring
stout
here
this
has
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
finishes
smooth
with
a
nice
lingering
sweetness
wow
i
ordered
a
large
clear
bottle
of
this
oatmeal
stout
at
my
newlyopened
local
beerpub
marys
and
i
savored
its
thick
dark
earthiness
over
delightful
conversation
with
one
of
the
pubs
owners
on
a
serenely
slow
tuesday
night
the
stout
poured
an
almost
jet
black
just
a
slight
shimmer
of
redbut
the
lighting
was
low
with
a
deep
tan
head
it
had
a
distinct
musty
smell
and
only
the
slightest
hint
of
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
it
was
viscous
and
even
creamy
with
little
carbonation
the
taste
had
a
heavy
maltiness
like
caramel
and
again
the
subtle
citrus
fruitiness
lingered
on
the
back
of
my
buds
i
liked
it
a
lot
so
i
ordered
another
and
it
continued
to
charm
mein
all
a
good
choice
from
start
to
finish
this
beer
pours
an
extremely
black
color
with
a
beautiful
brown
head
which
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
it
has
a
mild
chocolate
nose
with
whiffs
of
sweetness
this
beer
is
smooth
and
yet
has
the
most
complex
flavor
of
any
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
yet
i
can
taste
the
oats
chocolate
roasted
goodness
and
even
some
hoppiness
this
brew
has
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
that
helps
keep
the
flavor
lingering
until
you
are
ready
for
the
next
drink
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
to
date
while
it
is
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
it
is
definitely
something
i
will
treat
myself
to
again
rivisit
aug
29th
tweeked
the
numbers
a
bit
color
of
used
motor
oil
and
nearly
pours
as
thick
finger
high
head
of
yellowish
cream
of
spongyness
crumbles
fast
spotty
lace
that
sticks
like
glue
aroma
is
strong
of
oats
and
molasses
some
sweet
bitter
chocolate
and
lots
of
solid
roasted
malts
with
cherry
and
plum
notes
enjoyably
wafting
stout
nose
taste
really
smacks
of
nice
sweet
oat
character
the
whole
way
through
almost
too
much
its
sweetness
is
chewy
and
strong
roasted
malts
play
secondary
on
the
palatte
along
with
some
darl
fruityness
of
plum
and
very
light
bitter
chocolate
notes
which
alll
mostly
come
through
near
the
finish
feell
is
super
creamy
smooth
medium
body
with
the
center
being
more
full
has
a
easy
relaxing
calm
smooth
finish
thats
lightly
dry
lending
this
oatmeal
stout
to
be
smoothly
drinkable
goes
down
easy
a
sweet
chewy
treat
overall
great
beer
not
normally
a
dark
beer
drinker
i
think
this
great
beer
helps
to
change
my
mind
about
the
darker
brews
this
is
an
outstanding
drink
that
looks
good
and
tastes
great
it
has
great
black
coloring
with
a
decent
dark
tan
head
smooth
and
silky
it
has
no
single
flavor
that
overwhelms
the
palate
a
creamy
rich
delight
that
is
nicely
packaged
but
for
the
clear
bottle
definitely
would
be
great
with
many
different
foods
and
could
stay
through
the
evening
without
overstaying
its
welcome
cheers
this
is
a
delicious
mild
stout
very
creamy
and
smooth
a
550
ml
clear
glass
bottle
of
yummy
oatmeal
stout
rather
spendy
worth
every
penny
rich
complex
and
classic
brew
its
less
sophisticated
than
their
imperial
stout
but
it
still
creates
enough
havoc
in
the
mouth
to
keep
you
very
very
interested
this
is
one
of
my
sentimental
favorites
so
even
if
they
get
bought
out
by
ab
ill
still
drink
it
happy
to
sample
this
one
on
a
brutally
cold
eve
at
an
unsuspecting
bar
tgifs
tried
to
pour
the
best
i
could
into
my
glass
with
my
icy
fingers
i
think
my
efforts
could
have
been
better
but
overall
appearance
was
good
very
dark
liquid
with
a
thickish
foam
which
settled
in
nicely
forgot
to
check
my
glass
prior
for
head
maintenance
i
sensed
a
very
pleasant
roasted
and
alcoholic
quality
in
the
smell
and
my
tasting
quickly
followed
very
fine
taste
indeed
full
upfront
roasted
flavor
and
great
finish
mouthfeel
was
also
super
oatmealenhanced
my
tasting
notes
ended
here
but
knowing
i
had
to
sample
even
more
or
brave
the
cold
a
beerswitcher
stayed
true
to
this
brew
the
remaining
eve
one
of
my
top
choices
now
and
strongly
recommended
to
try
nice
deep
color
was
topped
by
an
airy
tan
head
that
disappated
lacing
was
thin
and
very
smattered
nice
roasty
smell
with
some
sweetness
silky
creamy
mouthfeel
mellow
roasted
flavor
a
nice
nightcap
upper
echelon
stout
but
i
dont
agree
with
the
majority
of
my
fellow
advocates
who
consider
this
the
king
youngs
is
my
opinion
folks
since
i
started
with
mentioning
the
mcauslan
i
better
finish
that
thought
the
mcauslan
is
aggressive
everywhere
that
samuel
smith
is
relaxed
and
smooth
sweet
effect
on
my
palette
and
the
oatmeal
was
very
apparent
the
only
thing
that
caught
me
off
gaurd
was
the
thin
mouthfeel
it
had
it
was
not
at
all
thick
this
cost
me
a
little
more
than
i
usually
spend
but
it
was
well
worth
it
why
the
clear
bottle
for
such
a
dark
beer
creamy
soft
texture
really
full
flavored
on
a
huge
frame
but
everything
works
so
nicely
together
it
is
not
loud
it
has
that
berryfruity
taste
that
great
bittersweet
chocolate
has
there
is
a
mellow
sweetness
here
that
you
almost
miss
because
it
is
so
mellow
despite
it
being
so
obvious
i
found
none
of
the
astringentbitterness
that
the
other
reviews
found
i
will
have
to
buy
a
case
and
drink
until
i
find
it
carbonation
seemed
to
hold
up
well
but
i
will
have
to
get
a
fresh
sample
this
weekend
to
compare
it
the
after
taste
was
dry
and
almost
nonexistent
but
still
left
a
slight
bitter
taste
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
all
in
all
i
would
still
consider
the
taste
outstanding
honestly
how
do
they
do
it
there
are
many
who
attempt
this
style
but
no
one
comes
close
to
samuel
smiths
when
it
comes
to
flavor
to
taste
to
utter
perfection
nothing
less
than
happiness
can
result
from
drinking
this
fine
brew
always
to
find
a
spot
among
my
top
five
absolutely
perfect
poured
dark
as
night
not
much
of
a
head
but
thats
ok
the
taste
was
rather
sweet
bordering
on
being
a
porter
it
had
many
unique
complexities
the
roasted
coffe
the
chocolate
etc
but
it
did
not
translate
very
well
for
me
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
a
meal
in
a
bottle
this
one
is
a
classic
english
stout
with
all
of
the
complexities
expected
from
much
touted
old
brewery
tadcaster
certainly
not
the
best
stout
in
my
opinion
nor
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
damn
good
this
beer
came
in
a
clear
bottle
surprised
me
and
poured
into
the
glass
a
dark
brownblack
but
when
held
to
the
light
there
were
ruby
highlights
the
head
was
beige
in
color
creamy
and
thick
the
lace
held
up
nicely
and
stretched
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
molasses
chocolate
dark
malt
and
slight
vanilla
the
tastes
were
sweet
and
creamy
not
thick
flavors
of
roasted
malt
coffee
bitter
hops
and
chocolate
in
the
end
and
some
what
dry
simple
and
yet
complex
all
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
i
am
surprised
that
i
had
not
tried
this
earlier
in
my
life
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
backwash
the
gold
standard
of
bottled
oatmeal
stouts
that
deceptive
clear
bottle
until
you
pour
this
stout
you
would
swear
it
was
in
a
brown
bottle
but
noooo
clear
as
glass
can
be
deep
brown
almost
opaque
brew
with
a
caramel
colored
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
eventually
fades
to
a
thin
layer
with
no
discernable
lace
sweet
chocolate
aroma
and
mollasses
smooth
taste
slightly
bitter
cocoa
coffee
malts
thinner
mouthfeel
than
expected
light
carbonation
overall
pretty
drinkable
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
f
nice
chocolate
flavor
and
typical
dark
stout
appearance
low
carbonation
and
light
body
for
an
oatmeal
stout
made
it
easy
to
drink
the
price
is
a
bit
high
and
will
keep
me
from
drinking
too
many
of
these
oelergud
cheers
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
is
as
black
as
a
moonless
sky
with
a
creamy
brown
head
it
is
fruity
in
the
nose
wih
a
bit
roastness
and
chocolate
as
well
creamy
smooth
with
chocolate
notes
it
is
almost
like
a
milk
shake
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
its
silky
smooth
to
a
semidry
finish
probably
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
yet
to
sample
medium
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
bitterness
is
tamed
down
by
the
creamy
roast
maltiness
personal
notes
this
is
a
very
good
quality
beer
and
true
to
style
my
taste
tends
to
favor
a
bit
more
bitterness
but
again
the
taste
fits
the
style
this
review
is
from
a
550
ml
clear
bottle
that
is
gold
rappedfor
most
of
the
neck
pours
dark
with
nice
head
and
leaves
good
lace
taste
is
chocolate
with
a
roasted
flavors
very
lightly
carbonation
full
bodied
drinking
more
than
2
of
these
is
out
of
question
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
sweet
caramel
up
front
followed
by
a
strong
bitter
burnt
coffee
taste
and
then
a
sweet
buttery
aftertaste
a
very
nice
stout
the
aroma
is
lacking
unless
served
at
about
50
degrees
the
palate
is
very
pleased
with
the
overall
texture
and
taste
of
this
fine
stout
very
drinkable
stout
a
damn
good
stout
but
in
the
samuel
smith
range
id
take
an
imperial
stout
or
taddy
porter
over
this
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
overrated
dark
brownblack
color
creamy
head
aroma
of
sweet
chocolate
and
well
roasted
malts
medium
body
with
a
creamy
silky
texture
great
flavors
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
i
like
the
imperial
a
tad
better
still
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
i
tried
this
one
because
it
had
such
a
high
ranking
and
i
was
not
disappointed
at
all
i
love
the
creamy
head
and
roasted
taste
of
this
beer
everytime
i
go
to
the
liquor
store
to
try
a
new
beer
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
over
and
over
comes
in
a
clear
12
oz
bottle
the
gold
foil
wrapped
over
the
cap
and
part
of
the
neck
of
the
bottle
is
a
nice
touch
pours
black
with
a
thick
light
brown
creamy
head
aroma
is
sweet
with
scents
of
raisins
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
texture
is
smooth
and
fullbodied
as
it
flows
over
the
tongue
lacks
dryness
of
most
stouts
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
with
roasted
malt
fruit
and
slight
soy
taste
i
also
noticed
this
like
the
previous
reviewer
this
is
an
amazing
stout
and
a
great
session
beer
smooth
black
pour
with
substantial
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
laces
very
nicely
full
smooth
nose
highlighted
by
creamy
roasted
notes
and
and
light
chocolate
a
wonderfully
full
flavor
profile
that
invites
my
third
use
of
the
word
smooth
initial
sweetness
reminds
me
of
spaten
optimator
but
doesnt
ever
fully
give
way
to
the
dry
crispness
of
alcohol
creamy
carmely
middle
with
a
lighter
version
of
the
typical
stout
profile
drink
after
drink
and
i
just
cant
pin
down
the
flavors
and
that
aint
a
bad
thing
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
top
off
this
wonderful
experience
this
is
what
its
all
about
sammy
smiths
oatmeal
stout
do
you
think
theyll
hire
me
to
write
slogans
for
them
i
didnt
think
so
either
seriously
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
im
only
21
but
still
simply
amazing
i
could
rave
about
this
stuff
for
days
ive
never
really
been
one
to
study
the
smell
appearance
and
mouthfeel
of
beers
like
some
of
the
aficionados
on
this
site
but
i
just
cant
help
it
with
this
one
from
the
wonderful
smoky
aroma
from
when
you
first
pop
the
cap
to
the
beautiful
tan
head
that
never
goes
away
to
the
slow
caramellike
finish
this
brew
is
a
winner
all
the
way
it
is
quite
expensive
but
imo
is
worth
it
everybody
should
try
this
beer
there
is
no
excuse
not
to
go
right
now
to
your
local
beer
store
and
get
some
of
this
and
when
you
get
to
the
checkout
counter
tell
em
hoss
mcgraw
sent
ya
a
nice
deep
dark
beer
that
pours
with
a
creamy
looking
tan
head
the
aromas
are
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
with
a
slight
alcohol
note
that
reminds
me
of
a
good
bourbon
the
finish
has
a
nice
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
slight
sweetness
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
as
creamy
as
i
expected
although
lower
abv
than
many
beers
i
drink
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
just
slightly
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
a
few
others
ive
had
lately
that
being
said
i
would
not
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
have
another
one
that
said
it
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
cant
drink
much
of
this
cheers
very
potent
tasting
and
rich
drink
i
like
to
drink
it
slowly
and
savor
it
as
a
special
treat
all
by
itself
very
pleasing
to
the
palette
and
hearty
enough
to
stick
to
the
ribs
at
the
same
time
a
thick
beer
with
full
bodied
flavor
but
surprisingly
smooth
the
over
all
is
a
rich
hop
taste
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
black
in
color
and
topped
by
a
creamy
dark
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
very
good
lace
when
held
to
bright
light
some
clear
brown
highlights
can
be
seen
the
aroma
offers
a
bright
fruitiness
some
light
chocolate
a
mild
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
fine
restrained
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
sweetly
malty
with
a
good
dose
of
fruitiness
up
front
followed
by
some
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
notes
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
finishing
with
a
more
noticeable
bitterness
some
nuttiness
and
a
long
lasting
gentle
roastiness
clearly
balanced
toward
the
sweet
side
theres
a
mild
diacetyl
here
that
seems
to
pull
the
whole
thing
together
it
never
appears
to
become
more
than
just
a
light
butterscotch
note
but
it
helps
to
round
everything
out
so
nicely
smoothing
out
the
roastiness
and
maybe
even
helping
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
a
very
nice
and
highly
enjoyable
beer
that
is
soft
sweet
light
but
also
offers
alot
of
character
allowing
it
to
fill
a
variety
of
different
roles
highly
recommended
i
read
lots
of
good
things
about
this
beer
and
it
is
one
of
bas
top
beers
alas
i
would
have
to
disagree
the
good
qualities
is
the
nice
thick
pour
and
its
dark
as
night
but
it
has
that
distinct
english
taste
and
aroma
to
it
unfortunatly
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
not
that
those
qualites
make
a
beer
bad
just
doesnt
make
a
fan
out
of
me
arguably
todays
premier
stout
and
there
is
no
wonder
to
its
popularity
dark
as
midnight
this
one
his
the
mouth
with
a
takeforce
flavor
but
parts
the
way
for
a
rewarding
creamy
sweetness
that
keeps
inviting
you
back
for
more
a
deep
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
mix
goes
down
as
smooth
as
ice
cream
i
usually
find
myself
having
a
few
in
a
row
before
realizing
it
a
nice
greybrown
satin
head
that
crinkles
up
in
the
middle
before
it
resolves
into
a
splotchy
torn
blanket
my
id
is
very
disappointed
with
the
color
it
wants
stout
to
be
black
black
black
which
this
isnt
this
is
more
of
a
dunkin
donuts
black
coffee
color
than
a
peets
espresso
but
who
cares
about
looks
sweet
candied
roasted
oats
it
smells
like
something
you
should
feed
a
reindeer
even
some
fruitcake
spices
are
lurking
underneath
making
the
whole
aroma
very
yule
oh
yeah
nuts
too
and
tobacco
a
cigarchomping
gluttonous
thrasher
a
perfect
attack
of
silky
malty
toasted
almonds
brazil
nuts
and
millet
with
a
shy
bitterness
that
gives
definition
and
cut
to
the
finish
this
is
soulful
stout
dont
expect
big
chewy
extract
though
this
is
rowboatmandolinsunspeckle
beer
happy
drinking
very
dark
with
only
hints
of
translucent
brown
at
the
edges
rocky
tan
head
with
impressive
staying
power
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
and
coffee
very
sweet
taste
that
is
almost
surprising
and
very
malty
a
bit
sticky
in
the
back
leaves
a
bit
of
caramel
roasted
and
smoky
peatlike
flavor
as
for
the
mouthfeel
it
melts
in
your
mouth
this
is
a
wonderful
very
impressive
and
unique
stout
wow
what
a
great
beer
somebody
had
to
tell
me
the
bottle
was
colorless
before
i
realized
that
was
the
color
of
the
beer
sweet
aroma
and
coffee
undertones
make
this
a
new
favorite
of
mine
if
only
it
were
more
readily
available
perfectly
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
beautiful
tan
head
and
leaves
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
some
roasted
sweetness
and
a
nutty
aroma
creamy
mouthfeel
very
smooth
has
a
unique
taste
and
it
does
not
have
the
amount
of
bitterness
many
stouts
do
this
is
a
real
treat
french
roast
in
color
big
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
medium
to
fullbodied
chocolate
and
light
smoke
run
through
the
finish
this
is
one
of
those
dessert
in
a
glass
beers
and
i
wish
i
had
another
it
was
nice
to
finally
get
a
decent
sample
of
this
stuff
has
been
two
or
so
years
thankfully
my
local
beer
store
is
running
ss
as
their
brewery
of
the
month
this
is
a
classic
stout
that
most
everyone
has
tried
or
has
at
least
heard
about
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
head
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
and
oatmeal
it
tastes
quite
sweet
caramel
notes
with
that
lingering
oatmeal
flavor
all
the
way
through
although
i
prefer
a
little
more
kick
to
my
stouts
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
brew
until
i
tried
samuel
smiths
imperial
stout
this
was
my
favorite
nice
black
color
roasted
maltcaramel
flavors
a
very
smooth
stout
i
feel
it
is
a
good
stout
for
people
new
to
the
style
opaque

with
a
tan
head
which
settles
to
a
lace
smell

of
roasted

carmel
flavors
of

and
just
a
touch
of
hops

an
outstanding
stoudt
dark
brown
not
quite
opaque

with
a
big
ol
creamy

strong
caramel
smell
carries
over
into
a
too
mellow

more

mouthfeel
is
watery
for
a
stout
ill
take
my
oatmeal
a
la

unless
i
want
to
drink
all

this
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
dark
and
heavy
with
a
medium
rocky
tan
head
complex
roasted
malt
and
cereal
aroma
the
beer
has
a
full
rich
taste
which
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
i
love
this
beer
a
mouthful
of
velvety
sweetness
who
needs
a
dry
irish
stout
when
you
have
those
sweet
english
brews
at
your
disposal
absolutely
a
must
for
any
beer
drinker

drink
cheers
this
is
a
brew
whose
reputation
precedes
it
as
being
one
of
the
best
stouts
in
the
world
the
mouth
feel
was
pleasingly
rich
but
not
clingy
providing
a
good
foundation
for
the
wellfocused
complex
oatmeal
taste
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
that
you
could
drink
all
night
however
i
find
that
rogues
shakespeare
stout
just
slightly
more
pleasing
both
are
must
tries

the
most
part

though
the
nose
is
pleasant
but
not
very
persuasive
oatmeal

and

are
the

magical
blend
of

samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
is
very
worthy
of
its
esteemed
reputation
this
is
a
must
drink
for
any
real
beer
drinker
positively
recommend
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
so
highly
rated
by
ba
started
with
a
finger
width
of
tan
head
that
lasted
for
awhile
with
minimal
lacing
after
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
chocolate
aroma
the
roasty
flavor
was
excellent
not
overbearing
like
some
stouts
can
be
it
had
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
was
very
drinkable
pours
almost
an
opaque
color
with
a
small
tan
colored
head
that
dies
really
quick
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
body
is
medium
on
the
nose
the
aromas
consisted
cereal
grains
oats
and
slightly
acidic
on
the
palate
grains
oats
nice
sweetness
caramel
and
a
bit
of
toffee
flavor
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
dry
overall
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
ever
had
i
thought
it
may
be
over
rated
at
first
but
not
anymore
this
was
my
first
samual
smith
i
was
also
amazed
by
this
thick
rich
black
brew
i
also
never
would
of
guessed
it
came
in
a
clear
bottle
its
dark
full
of
bodytan
head
and
glass
lace
was
very
drinkable
nice
for
dessert
now
i
cant
wait
to
try
an
imperial
stout
it
is
very
rich
and
dark
with
great
coffee
and
oat
flavors
jumping
all
over
you
man
this
is
a
stout
i
would
love
to
find
a
beer
that
i
enjoy
more
than
this
i
am
partial
to
stouts
but
as
they
go
this
one
is
the
top
of
the
top
shelf
one
was
enough
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
a
bit
pricy
for
an
average
stout
although
it
was
easy
to
drink
it
lacked
any
kind
of
lingering
aftertaste
tried
it
again
and
havent
changed
my
mind
one
bit
maybe
a
little
liked
it
less
than
the
first
time
after
tasting
storm
king
i
dropped
my
rating
of
this
beer
another
point
in
taste
pours
like
liquid
midnight
from
a
bottle
sweet
and
some
what
musty
this
brew
slakes
any
thirst
cures
any
ill
and
takes
out
the
garbage
if
you
drink
enough
of
it
a
stoutmans
stout
this
is
something
to
write
home
about
who
need
nitrogen
black
with
ruby
highlights
in
the
body
big
thick
beige

that
you
can
sculpt

down

richness
that
reduces

fullbodied
with
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
goes
well
with
food
there
is
not
a
single
aspect
of
this
beer
that
is
weak
the
aroma
is
a
wonderful
mild
roasted

with
a
slight
sweetness

full
and
rich

with
wonderful

the
whole
journey
from

enjoyable
there
is
a
great
smoothness
a
slight
oily
quality
maybe
a
little
thin
with
a
very
pleasant
lingering
at
the
finish

truly
great
drinking
experience

one
of
the
richest
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
almost
leans
towards
an
imperial
the
complexity
of
the
malts
makes
this
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
tried
would
love
to
try
one
of
these
on
tap
in
london
to
see
if
the
trip
and
the
clear
bottle
effects
the
taste
when
my
mom
used
to
try
to
shovel
down
the
quaker
stuff
i
would
gag
if
only
shed
known
about
mr
smith
this
is
wicked
stuff
and
without
question
one
of
the
finest
stouts
ive
ever
tried
big
bold
and
beautiful
the
irish
drink
pony
pee
by
comparison
this
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
color
and
formed
a
light
tan
bubbly
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
touch
of
oatmeal
a
flavor
of
malt
hops
and
lightly
of
oatmeal
i
love
the
color
of
this
beer
i
have
always
liked
samuel
smith
beers
even
if
they
are
a
bit
pricey
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
and
feel
some
people
are
put
off
by
the
name
oatmeal
thinking
it
is
something
there
mother
is
trying
to
shove
down
their
throat
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
trying
to
get
a
feel
for
this
type
of
stout
this
is
a
quality
brew
but
i
was
not
as
impressed
as
others
on
this
site
it
is
dark
black
opeque
with
a
sweetish
cherry
like
nose
dark
tan
head
roast
malt
flavor
with
a
sweet
coat
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
very
smooth
it
was
good
but
not
quite
good
enough
to
give
it
5s
i
did
have
2
of
these
in
a
hotel
bar
so
i
will
taste
again
in
the
future
and
modify
my
rating
if
needed
oh
me
oh
my
believe
the
hype
this
oatmeal
stout
looks
so
delicious
black
big
frothy
head
and
then
you
have
a
sip
ohhhhh
mmmmm
wow
my
favorite
beer
in
the
entire
world
words
cannot
express
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
words
would
not
do
it
justice
just
get
a
bottle
for
yourself
and
experience
ecstasy
as
near
as
perfection
as
i
have
had
pours
a
midnight
black
with
a
nice
fluffy
beige
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
strong
but
not
overbearing
i
loved
the
sweet
first
taste
and
the
wonderful
easy
smoothness
of
this
beer
nice
thick
almost
chewy
feel
to
it
the
roasted
chocolate
and
slight
bitterness
toward
the
end
was
just
right
i
tried
this
based
on
the
beer
advocates
rating
and
it
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
of
all
the
beers
i
have
had
this
is
the
most
memorable
of
the
stouts
i
have
had
i
would
rank
them
1
sam

2

3

4
old
rasputin
imperial
i
was
skeptical
that
this
beer
could
live
up
to
its
reputation
but
it
truly
is
a
wonderful
stout
the
color
was
spot
on
and
the
head
nicely
colored
and
creamy
nice
full
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
mixed
with
flavors
i
could
not
identify
the
beer
finishes
smooth
and
dry
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
overall
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
it
is
an
elite
oatmeal
stout
best
in
the
world
probably
not
as
luck
would
have
it
my
local
packy
just
got
a
fresh
shipment
the
day
i
noticed
it
was
at
the
top
of
bas
top
beers
list
giddyup
pours
blackduh
with
thin
tan
head
roasty
aromas
with
a
slight
yorkshire
yeast
twang
you
can
almost
smell
the
smoothness
the
stuff
slips
down
your
throat
so
quick
you
become
thankfull
it
comes
in
a
bigass
550ml
bottle
the
contrast
between
sweet
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
and
the
drying
bitterness
of
the
burnt
malt
and
hops
is
amazing
i
havent
had
this
in
many
years
but
will
most
definately
buy
it
again
very
soon
pours
out
an
opaque
murky
brown
colour
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
reduced
quickly
but
left
lots
of
patchy
lace
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
ripened
fruits
and
butter
full
bodied
mouthfeel
is
complimented
by
the
roasted
malt
incredibly
silky
smooth
and
satisfying
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
some
fruitiness
in
the
taste
profile
and
the
use
of
oatmeal
really
takes
the
edge
off
any
bitterness
that
is
present
and
makes
the
drinkability
all
the
better
certainly
worthy
of
all
praise
and
deserving
of
its
high
rating
had
this
last
night
and
realized
how
good
this
beer
is
it
had
been
awhile
since
i
drank
this
stout
and
decided
to
pick
one
up
after
seeing
it
sitting
near
the
top
here
for
some
time
i
should
have
done
it
sooner
i
actually
had
a
youngs
double
chocalate
stout
afterwards
and
this
is
the
one
that
was
rememberable
enough
to
review
tonight

although
a

be

a
meal
itself
the
smell
turns
me
off
slightly
but
it
is
quite
tasty
and
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
throat
it
feels
like
it
hits
lighter
than
a
5
though
which
is
good
imo
i
suggest
having
it
without
a
meal

the

but
it
needs
more
flavor
there
is
that
characteristic
nuttiness
to
the
profile
that
i
find
interesting
and
nice
to
note
this
beer
review
might
suffer
because
of
a
backtoback
comparison
with
rogue
shakespeare
the
thick
beige
head
tops
the
nearly
black
hued
brew
a
hint
of
a
deep
but
clear
garnet
color
is
discernable
when
held
to
light
its
appetizing
in
appearance
the
very
pleasant
aroma
is
comprised
of
chocolate
butterscotch
mild
roasted
barley
and
a
hint
of
yeast
derived
fruitiness
the
meager
hint
of
kent
goldings
is
dominated
by
the
malt
notes
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
like
a
good
outmeal
stout
should
have
bittersweet
in
flavor
from
a
superlative
balance
of
residual
sugars
and
bitterness
from
roasted
grain
and
moderate
hopping
the
mild
diacetyl
combined
w
the
chocolate
malt
flavors
lends
a
rich
dark
chocolate
note
finishes
w
sweetness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
a
mellow
bitterness
that
coats
my
palette
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
is
the
epitomy
of
balance
compared
to
many
microbrewed
versions
its
quite
sophisticated
its
worth
the
extra
price
ive
forgotten
how
good
this
is
excellent
there
is
such
a
nice
balance
to
this
stout
it
has
a
slight
sweet
taste
that
combines
with
that
of
lightly
rosted
coffee
with
a
molasses
finish
man
i
sound
like
a
food
critic
from
a
fancy
restaurant
just
now
ouch
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
the
oats
make
beers
of
this
style
like
a
meal
90
doesnt
have
the
burnt
bitterness
of
the
dry
stouts
but
it
has
the
other
flavors
typical
off
a
stout
i
like
it
but
it
doesnt
floor
me
this
beer
appears
black
and
has
great
tan
head
with
great
retention
which
i
have
not
seen
lately
from
a
bottled
beer
beautiful
cocoacoffee
aroma
the
brew
rolls
over
the
tongue
like
velvet
taste
of
coffee
beans
and
bittersweet
chocolate
dominate
theres
a
nice
bitterness
here
the
hops
arent
distinguishable
but
the
bitterness
is
i
think
the
bitterness
is
probably
more
due
to
the
roasted
malts
great
oatmeal
stout
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
beautiful
blackruby
color
with
a
lacy
tan
head
an
initial
tanginess
that
gives
way
to
a
deep
chocolate
and
sweet
coffee
taste
finishing
so
smooth
and
creamy
you
feel
youre
in
total
beer
bliss
absolutely
wonderful
finishes
with
a
slight
coco
bitterness
quite
complex
and
on
the
heavy
side
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
damn
near
perfect
but
i
have
to
fault
sam
smith
for
using
clear
glass
bottles
despite
that
this
sweet
stout
holds
its
flavor
pretty
well
creamy
beige
head
atop
a
black
beer
although
not
as
dark
as
sss
taddy
porter
very
sweet
an
excellent
dessert
beer
a
marked
contrast
to
the
equally
pleasurable
but
much
spicier
imperial
stout
the
oatmeal
is
detectable
but
insignificant
compared
to
the
amount
of
sugar
which
puts
a
nice
cap
on
the
warm
malt
character
the
beer
equivalent
of
coffee
with
cream
and
lots
of
sugar
low
in
alcohol
but
too
sweet
to
drink
lots
of
i
can
not
even
begin
to
describe
how
spectacular
this
beer
is
i
had
to
go
back
and
change
lower
my
ratings
of
the
bells
oatmeal
because
it
is
not
in
this
league
not
many
beers
are
everything
about
it
is
fantastic
great
sweet
scintilating
aroma
blacktovery
dark
ruby
reddish
in
appearance
with
a
soft
lace
sweet
creamy
and
smooth
delicious
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bite
on
the
finish
i
taste
the
oats
strong
and
almost
a
cream
sweetness
to
it
i
have
yet
to
try
the
ss
imperial
but
it
would
be
tough
to
top
this
after
years
of
meaning
to
try
this
stout
i
finally
got
around
to
it
recently
and
am
left
wonder
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
it
may
be
a
better
than
average
stout
but
plenty
of
less
expensive
stouts
are
better
considering
expecations
i
found
the
taste
to
be
rather
bland
and
lacking
in
subtlety
overall
pretty
good
my
first
stout
to
drink
so
keep
that
in
mind
when
reading
this
i
love
the
look
the
smell
and
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
taste
though
i
still
consider
it
to
be
pretty
good
i
will
drink
it
again
but
probably
wont
purchase
it
again
anytime
soon

its
so
damn
easy
to
drink
almost
dangerous
im
trying
to
take
it
slow
but
it
keeps
calling
my
name
without
a
doubt
the
best
brew
in
the
world
a
perfectly
balanced
stout
even
if
you
dont
like
stouts
this
is
one
worth
tryingyou
just
may
become
a
convert
an
absolutely
amazing
oatmeal
stout
incredibly
smooth
perfection
notes
a
cult
classic
among
beer
geeks
dating
back
to
1980
lets
have
a
moment
of
silence
in
honour
of
this
fine
brew
if
you
want
to
jump
into
the
world
of
stouts
give
this
one
a
try
you
might
be
surprised
and
actually
love
it
i
did
that
is
for
sure
a
beautiful
looking
brew
that
goes
down
smooth
and
never
disappoints
like
drinking
quaker
oats
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
im
a
little
more
reserved
about
its
merit
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
on
earth
a
bit
pricey
but
well
worth
the
price
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
every
sip
fairly
underwhelming
though
i
guess
thats
somewhat
true
of
many
oatmeal
stouts
for
me
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
and
great
roasty
flavors
on
draft
at
the
brewery
in
minneapolis
color
is
pitch
black
like
dark
chocolate
aroma
is
a
bit
of
sweet
cocoa
taste
sweet
chocolate
coffee
and
milky
like
a
thai
iced
coffee
very
drinkable
especially
at
5

overall
highly
enjoyable
but
16
oz
could
be
a
bit
much
a
stellar
oatmeal
stout
smooth
creamy
deeply
roasty
very
nice
beer
is
medium
in
body
bitter
sweet
good
mouthfeel
nice
beer
throughout
id
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
super
smooth
and
velvety
oatmeal
slightly
bitter
chocolate
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
growlers
gettin
kicked
tonight
no
problem
o
good
drinkability
well
done
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
but
better
than
average
overall
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
the
smoke
and
milk
flavors
add
a
nice
touch
m
light
and
pleasant
for
an
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
bodied
with
nice
carb
awesome
beer
o
gotta
say
this
is
one
fine
stout
doesnt
knock
you
over
the
head
but
it
does
everything
right
o
wow
another
well
crafted
beer
from
minneapolis
town
hall
wish
i
had
a
brewery
of
this
quality
by
me
this
is
drinkable
well
put
together
and
full
of
flavor
this
has
as
much
flavor
as
many
imperial
stouts
i
have
had
overall
nice
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
something
id
drink
if
i
was
in
the
area
for
sure
overall
not
bad
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
town
hall
did
a
decent
job
with
this
oatmeal
stout
it
had
just
enough
body
to
make
it
palletable
any
less
and
it
would
have
tasted
like
typical
microbrew
failings
this
beer
was
dark
opaque
with
nice
tan
head
that
laced
the
smell
included
roast
and
espresso
the
taste
was
nice
and
balanced
others
at
the
table
thought
bitter
but
i
didnt
think
so
great
balance
with
the
roast
coffee
and
enough
hops
to
clean
the
pallet
without
being
to
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
good
more
body
would
be
nice
the
abv
was
perfect
and
this
is
definitely
a
good
stout
d
super
high
could
drink
this
6
beer
all
night
o
solid

stout
enjoyable
creaminess
to
it
easy

comments
very
happy
to
have
received
this

i
have
heard
many
good
things
about
minneapolis
town
hall
its
nice
to
know
not
all
government
is
burdened
by
red
tape
and
yes
i
know
its
just
the
name
of
the
brewery
mouthfeeldrinkability
just
over
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
for
an
oatmeal
stout
not
as
smooth
and
creamy
as
others
that
ive
had
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
make
it
to
town
hall
mnbearsfan
hooked
me
up
with
a
growler
of
black
h2o
oatmeal
stout
drank
from

and
pint
just
polished
it
off
syrupy
thick
black
pour
with
super
dark
brown
head
nose
of
roasted
nuts
bread
the
hops
really
come
through
taste
of
roasted

and
barley
with
a
strong
earthiness
finishes
with
some
vanilla
thick
but
smooth
lots
of
carbonation
very
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
well
made
stout
worth
trying
but
nothing
special
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
good
amount
of
roast
and
creaminess
to
it
decent
drinkability
as
well
i
would
have
to
call
this
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
there
is
only
one
other
that
i
could
say
comes
close
its
all
around
great
and
has
such
an
outstanding
flavor
profile
on
cask
is
equal
to
beer
perfection
this
is
a
town
hall
must
try
for
anyone
drinkability
high
full
flavored
and
very
drinkable
this
may
well
be
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
could
just
work
between
glasses
of
this
and
the
masala
mama
and
be
a
happy
man
here
md
another
winner
from
town
hall
minneapolis
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
highly
recommend
trying
this
brew
and
picking
up
a
cheap
growler
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
very
nice
brown
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
one
of
abundant
roasted
grains
combined
with
bits
of
coffee
and
a
few
nibbles
of
chocolate
the
oats
work
their
way
out
as
well
the
taste
brings
the
oats
out
a
little
bit
more
and
also
includes
some
mild
bittering
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nicemediumbodied
and
quite
chewy
very
drinkable
considering
the
style
and
something
id
love
to
have
a
constant
supple
of
as
the
leaves
fall
off
the
trees
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
tan
head
which
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
coffee
oatmeal
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
bitter
coffee
flavor
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
smooth
easy
to
drink
oatmeal
stout
enjoyed
at
town
hall
brewery
in
minneapolis
mn
poured
a
black
body
with
a
light
tan
head
of
foam
aroma
was
dark
roasted
malts
and
i
swear
i
could
smell
straw
full
bodied
with
a
smoothy
creamy
mouthfeel
this
one
starts
off
great
but
it
turns
out
to
be
too
sweet
half
way
through
i
was
tired
of
it
and
wished
id
ordered
something
different
too
bad
for
something
that
is
always
on
tap
at
town
hall
im
surprised
ive
never
had
this
before
that
has
changed
and
this
is
now
one
of
my
town
hall
favorites
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
was
full
bodied
and
had
the
right
touch
of
carbonation
it
leaves
a
nice
dry
palate
pours
a
dark
brown
pretty
clear
almost
black
but
lets
enough
light
through
that
you
can
see
bubbles
cascading
up
through
the
beer
the
head
is
densely
packed
about
12cms
brown
colored
and
it
leaves
bits
of
lacing
as
i
drink
looks
nice
the
primary
smells
are
coffee
and
chocolate
a
good
bit
of
roasted
malts
and
not
leaning
too
heavily
in
any
one
direction
theres
also
the
sort
of
standard
sweetness
mixed
with
the
kind
of
smell
i
can
hardly
describe
as
anything
but
the
oats
the
taste
is
right
on
it
tastes
kind
of
slick
nearly
syrupy
with
a
tiny
bit
of
esters
but
its
nice
and
sweet
there
are
hints
of
coffee
but
really
it
tastes
more
like
roasted
not
quite
burnt
or
charred
malts
fresh
cracked
at
times
it
feels
a
bit
too
slick
and
the
cask
doesnt
contribute
much
to
the
flavor
just
the
feeling
but
it
does
serve
to
balance
out
the
flavors
a
bit
in
the
beer
especially
when
you
can
get
a
sip
of
the
creamy
foam
on
top
the
low
carbonation
in
the
beer
itself
leads
to
a
more
full
feeling
as
well
but
it
also
exposes
a
bit
of
thinness
in
the
finish
still
this
one
is
right
on
for
an
oatmeal
stout
the
beer
is
enjoyable
its
nice
and
smooth
just
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
not
too
much
of
a
heavy
hitter
though
a
bit
higher
in
abv
than
i
expected
overall
and
enjoyable
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
on
cask
had
on
tap
at
mth
the
appearance
was
black
as
night
with
a
nice
beige
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
to
a
nice
beige
cherry
ring
with
some
sticky
lacing
on
the
side
the
smell
is
chocolate
molasses
roasted
coffee
plum
and
some
berry
smells
the
taste
was
a
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
smell
with
a
small
amount
of
oatmeal
nothing
dominated
in
this
stout
but
all
was
present
and
competing
in
the
flavor
it
was
fantastic
and
nicely
balanced
wow
this
is
one
great
stout
that
is
full
but
at
the
same
time
easy
to
throw
back
a
couple
in
a
hurry
really
drinkable
and
highly
flavorful
a
perfect
oatmeal
stout
highly
recommended
d
a
damn
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
the
only
thing
i
would
change
would
be
to
remove
that
little
blackcherry
flavor
nuance
but
otherwise
this
is
top
notch
and
would
happily
drink
another
growler
of
it
if
i
could
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
i
only
wish
we
had
had
more
time
to
spend
at
town
hall
so
i
could
have
tried
more
of
their
beers
drinkability
decent
stout
overall
but
there
are
many
others
i
would
rather
choose
d
could
probably
have
a
couple
of
these
which
is
great
for
such
a
thick
stout
d
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
works
very
well
on
a
freezing
minnesota
day
d
if
i
was
going
to
be
in
this
area
for
longer
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
want
to
keep
in
the
hotel
fridge
as
a
growler
well
they
took
this
off
nitro
i
am
toldthough
it
had
the
characteristics
of
a
nitro
but
more
the
taste
of
a
tap
the
carbonation
is
good
at
the
hall
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
smell
it
is
dark
and
lacey
an
above
average
mouthfeel
not
as
creamy
as
a
nitro
chocolate
rich
a
good
stout
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
satisfying
i
had
a
couple
and
was
pleased
with
my
choice
looks
great
almost
black
with
small
latte
head
creamy
and
smooth
as
hell
not
complex
malty
with
a
great
body
milky
sweet
a
bit
too
sweet
too
much
by
the
end
excellent
example
for
a
brewpub
though
seems
like
a
good
one
to
have
in
the
start
of
winter
poured
almost
black
with
dark
chocolate
brown
hues
1
finger
of
bubbly
burnt
orange
head
had
ok
retention
and
left
some
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
lightly
burnt
coffee
tastes
of
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
dark
cocoa
and
oat
with
a
burnt
coffee
finish
and
a
touch
of
citrus
medium
in
body
but
somewhat
thin
semismooth
with
lots
of
roasty
flavors
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
seems
to
focus
more
on
burnt
flavors
than
anything
else
definitely
a
finishing
beer
as
itll
kill
your
palate
dgood
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
lacking
body
and
balls
i
certainly
am
one
that
can
get
behind
a
sessionable
stout
but
this
simply
seems
to
be
lacking
on
first
appearance
an
excellent
looking
stout
dark
color
light
tanbrown
head
maintained
head
well
aroma
was
malty
and
slightly
sweet
good
body
good
mouthfeel
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
slightly
bitter
but
the
bitterness
did
not
linger
excellent
drinkability
and
very
quoffable
i
highly
recommend
this
one
had
this
one
at
the
mthb
ontap
poured
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
fine
film
of
tan
head
on
top
looks
solid
no
real
highlights
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
nose
is
lots
of
sweetness
oats
cookies
and
then
of
course
a
good
amount
of
roasted
malt
in
there
as
well
flavor
is
likewise
a
down
and
dirty
beer
if
you
catch
my
meaning
tons
of
roasted
malt
but
not
in
a
drying
way
lots
of
sweet
cookies
and
some
chocolate
in
there
as
well
to
help
keep
it
drinkable
coffee
flavors
swirling
a
solid
brew
feel
is
nice
and
full
as
it
should
be
but
not
so
filling
you
couldnt
drink
a
couple
overall
a
nice
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
graham
crackers
vanilla
cream
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
and
vanilla
in
the
start
and
graham
cracker
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
fine
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
at
the
pub
and
at
home
in
growler
form
give
me
another
pours
an
absolute
onyx
black
with
a
fluffy
dark
tan
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
thin
lacing
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
rich
caramel
and
sweet
toasted
oat
roasted
barley
with
chocolate
and
molasses
malt
some
coffee
and
cream
with
cane
sugar
just
an
overall
complex
smelling
beer
silky
smooth
all
the
way
such
an
amazing
feel
in
the
mouth
pretty
hefty
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
i
like
it
alot
thanks
again
todd
i
think
the
masala
mama
is
up
next
time
to
go
kick
kalebs
ass
in
cricket
drinkability
its
to
bad
i
drove
as
i
would
like
to
put
back
a
ton
of
these
this
beer
was
clearly
a
treat
the
noncask
version
would
rate
just
slightly
lower
only
on
the
mouthfeel
portion
but
i
feel
it
is
definitely
worth
drinking
as
well
if
you
are
at
mthb
and
this
beer
is
on
cask
you
must
try
it
highly
recommended
in
a
headtohead
battle
royale
with
sammy
smith
oatmeal
stout
i
put
my
money
on
the
black
h20
its
just
so
smooth
and
creamy
all
the
while
providing
a
chocolate
malt
body
with
a
hint
off
roasted
grains
and
coffee
its
hard
not
to
love
this
is
a
beer
drinkers
beer
d
i
really
like
it
i
think
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
will
however
try
this
again
when
i
have
the
chance
deep
dark
color
is
pretty
much
black
topped
by
a
medium
brown
head
sweet
malt
aroma
is
touched
by
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
very
appealing
flavor
has
a
solid
roasted
note
that
blends
well
with
a
sweet
malt
character
silky
smooth
oatmeal
oily
texture
just
adds
to
the
experience
the
vanilla
and
charred
malt
complement
the
mix
of
flavors
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
solid
drinkability
is
very
good
a
nice
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
nice
head
half
inch
to
a
thin
film
decent
lacing
pretty
nice
aroma
is
weak
but
noticed
dark
roasted
malts
not
so
much
oatmeal
hints
and
maybe
some
chocolates
pretty
nice
but
nothing
special
the
taste
is
what
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
nothing
more
nothing
less
mouth
is
the
same
i
may
be
underwhelmed
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
pretty
much
perfect
with
half
of
their
food
menu
very
much
an
everyday
beer
for
anyone
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
one
i
would
frequent
if
available
to
me
luckily
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
within
reach
but
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
a
more
sweet
oatmeal
stout
if
only
to
remind
me
what
else
is
out
there
the
fore
is
again
quite
roasty
with
vanilla
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
a
hint
of
ripe
dark
fruit
the
aftertaste
is
sweeter
with
less
roasted
notes
and
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
low
carbonation
and
that
hefty
feel
of
a
good
stout
despite
some
thinness
to
the
flavor
through
the
middle
this
is
a
pretty
nice
brew
and
im
tickled
pink
to
have
a
whole
growler
to
enjoy
had
a
pint
yesterday
and
it
seems
even
tastier
today

deep
coffesque
and
cream
aroma
with
tons
of
cocoa
and
roast

is
smoky
seet
creamy
and
loaded
with
sugar
molasses
and
more
coffee
yet
mellow
rounded
and
fruity
almost
like
this
beer
has
had
a
mellow
barleywine
added
to
it
theres
a
subtle
gentle
brandy
quality
with
warming
tones
and
a
high
level
of
complexity
and
depth
im
really
enjoying
this
a
decent
run
of
tahitian
vanilla
bean
and
sweet
caramel
lucious
damn
town
hall
makes
stouts
best
drinks
like
a
light
meal
and
would
go
very
well
with
a
tradional
english
style
comfort
meal
of
pot
roast
potatoes
carrots
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
i
could
find
myself
drinking
on
a
daily
basis
it
looks
great
smells
wonderfullots
of
roasted
malt
i
love
stouts
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
in
the
flavor
smell
or
appearance
category
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
the
mouthfeel
i
think
that
it
should
be
a
little
thicker
i
like
a
stout
to
be
stout
in
every
way
with
a
big
mouthfeel
a
nice
aroma
and
a
rich
taste
i
just
felt
that
h2o
met
two
out
of
the
three
requirements
i
could
drink
them
all
night
but
it
still
felt
like
it
was
misnamed
to
me
just
a
stout
not
thick
enough
to
be
an
oatmeal
stout
where
this
brew
really
stands
out
is
the
creamy
mouthfeel
its
just
perfectly
smooththeres
no
other
way
to
describe
it
that
smoothness
works
to
perfection
with
sweetness
but
doesnt
work
quite
as
well
with
bitterness
i
waited
a
few
days
before
cracking
this
growler
and
im
sure
that
a
fresh
pint
would
inch
things
up
here
if
this
were
even
remotely
available
to
me
in
the
ne
where
i
am
or
cali
where
im
going

would
be

a
big
thanks
to
a
person
in
minneapolis
minnesota
for
this
growler
of
beer
had
this
earlier
this
month
poured
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
aroma
roasted
malts
caramel
chocolate
dark
cherries
a
nice
sweetness
just
lingers
over
the
top
of
the
glass
flavor
the
sweetness
is
just
right
for
me
got
chocolate
covered
cherries
malts
a
touch
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
that
just
made
it
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
just
kept
filling
my
glass
i
think
i
drank
34
of
the
growler
in
a
very
short
period
time
like
45
min
drinkability
is
good
but
its
a
big
enough
beer
that
youre
not
going
to
have
more
than
a
pint
thats
fine
with
me
and
seems
correct
for
the
style
drinkability
nice
toasted
and
rich
flavors
texture
could
use
some
work
but
all
around
a
tasty
beer
that
id
have
again
da
great
oatmeal
stout
finished
the
4
pint
growler
in
one
sitting
and
was
still
not
full
but
very
tipsy
as
i
hadnt
eaten
since
lunch
could
have
drank
this
all
night
a
great
winter
brew
this
beer
could
end
up
being
my
winter
beer
for
a
good
long
while
last
swigs
this
was
so
good
that
i
had
to
debate
taking
back
a
growler
of
this
and
masala
mama
but
i
opted
for
two
masala
mama
growlers
this
beer
poured
a
dark
black
that
let
through
some
burgundy
light
its
head
looked
like
creamy
hot
chocolate
and
left
minimal
lacing
smells
like
espresso
and
lots
of
chocolate
with
a
slight
sourness
tastes
like
sour
blueberries
black
liquorish
and
coffee
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
a
little
on
the
flat
side
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
i
do
enjoy
oatmeal
stout
however
this
one
did
nothing
to
make
me
go
wow
the
smell
started
me
off
nice
but
the
taste
was
not
as
impressive
there
is
the
taste
of
roasted
grains
and
caramel
this
beer
is
filling
and
enjoyable
but
dont
expect
to
be
swept
off
of
your
feet
drinkability
this
is
what
i
order
when
there
are
no
special
beers
at
the
brewery
very
drinkable
unfortunately
i
have
not
been
able
to
try
this
yet
at
the
brewery
as
soon
as
i
do
im
very
confident
that
my
rating
of
this
brew
will
be
substantially
higher
i
attribute
the
carbonation
problems
to
the
growler
not
the
beer
itself
i
just
wish
i
could
have
enjoyed
this
beer
in
its
full
glory
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
wait
until
my
next
trip
to
town
hall
im
anxious
to
try
it
again
the
beer
was
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
a
good
taste
that
is
sweeter
then
most
oatmeal
stouts
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
nitro
but
i
think
it
gave
more
of
a
smoother
and
creamer
taste
but
also
limits
the
malty
flavor
black
h2o
has
a
very
creamy
chocolate
head
looks
like
the
beer
has
cream
filling
jet
black
smells
and
i
quote
myself
really
really
good
of
lactose
and
chocolate

compliments
the
flavour
very
nicely
i
highly
suggest
it
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
good
oatmeal
stout
smooth
taste
oatmeal
chocolate
roasted
malts
nose
is
about
the
same
i
appreciate
a
guinness
or
the
left
hand
milk
stout
a
lot
more
good
beer
but
not
entirely
my
liking
one
of
my
favorite
beers
black
and
slick
looking
feignt
roasty
smell
decent
beer
but
cant
get
over
the
bitter
aftertaste
may
need
to
give
this
another
try
from
another
batch
this
is
a
great
smooth
roasty
stout
everything
one
should
be
mine
were
not
bitter
at
all
like
some
have
commented
only
thing
i
might
like
is
a
tad
more
body
but
it
has
enough
as
is
i
just
like
to
chew
my
stouts
and
this
one
is
rather
drinkable
very
good
none
the
less
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
i
dont
always
agree
with
the
bros
rating
but
fully
agree
with
their
96
this
time
oxidized
thin
chalky
needs
an
overhaul
great
oatmeal
stout
great
overaal
one
of
my
favorites
to
be
honest
i
like
it
meh
maybe
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
something
but
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
as
much
as
it
did
for
others
coppery
aftertaste
no
lacing
finally
i
found
an
oatmeal
stout
that
is
equal
to
possibly
better
than
havent
decided
yet
drakes
crude
oatmeal
stout
this
is
sooooo
tasty
and
sooo
delicious
it
tastes
like
a
sweet
creamy
buttery
sweet
treat
rather
than
beer
you
know
the
butter
beer
in
harry
potter
that
instantly
warmed
them
up
etc
yea
thats
this
stuff
right
here
the
only
reason
drakes
crude
i
think
beats
it
is
because
wolavers
is
5
9
and
dc
is
6
9
still
top
notch
though
awesome
oatmeal
stout
very
comparable
to
browns
oatmeal
stout
but
slightly
thicker
and
better
hints
of
oatmeal
o
its
an
ok
beer
the
tastes
are
very
muted
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
and
id
only
pull
one
on
tap
if
there
are
no
other
stouts
standard
go
to
3
635
ever
been
dropkicked
by
roasted
malts
before
dark
dark
poured
nicely
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
which
left
slowly
molasses
and
malt
are
predominate
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
hops
overall
a
good
balanced
beer
and
done
well
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
a
solid
stout
especially
considering
a
six
pack
is
priced
a
few
dollars
less
than
some
of
the
more
wellknown
examples
of
the
style
made
in
new
england
organic
and
not
too
pricey
recommend
overall
love
wolavers
coffee
porter
ive
only
had
a
sip
of
their
oatmeal
stout
until
now
this
may
now
become
on
of
my
goto
choices
very
good
brew
awesome
oatmeal
stout
simple
but
great
new
taste
score
4
25
o
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
a
fantastic
complex
yet
wellbalance
brew
all
the
taste
profiles
help
highlight
the
style
first
time
having
a
wolaver
brew
and
look
to
enjoy
some
more
of
their
offerings
not
sure
how
they
rate
this
a
96
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
but
not
really
above
average
for
an
oatmeal
stout
nice
flavor
very
drinkable
nothing
super
interesting
though
i
got
a
wolavers
mix
box
for
xmas
and
everything
in
it
was
good
but
just
good
ive
been
to
their
brewery
several
time
and
they
always
have
something
better
on
tap
there
than
you
can
find
in
a
bottle
a
great
oatmeal
stout
very
well
balanced
and
packs
quite
a
nice
dry
bitter
punch
o
the
abv
is
right
and
drinkable
but
it
could
be
more
stoutlike
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
i
would
get
it
again
overall
i
feel
like
this
is
a
hugely
underrated
brew
every
time
i
get
it
i
am
impressed
complex
yet
subtle
enough
to
put
down
several
balanced
and
clean
100
recommend
this
brew
while
i
said
in
the
mouthfeel
that
i
wanted
it
to
be
creamier
i
feel
that
if
it
were
it
might
make
it
into
an
entirely
different
brew
in
terms
of
booziness
and
drinkability
so
i
think
it
being
the
way
it
is
works
for
it
there
are
other
brews
that
come
at
the
oatmeal
stout
from
a
more
imperial
angle
great
beer
coffee
is
complimented
with
the
creaminess
perfectly
musttry
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
is
the
best
otter
creekwolavers
beer
that
ive
had
to
date
by
far
sessionable
organic
good
for
you
id
like
to
have
a
case
of
this
along
side
my
favorite
dales
pale
ale
and
sometimes
id
black
tan
them
onot
awful
but
i
wont
order
another
one
on
tap
these
flaws
are
preventable
and
are
mostly
from
brewing
technique
this
could
be
a
very
good
beer
and
maybe
is
in
the
bottle
as
other
reviews
here
indicate
pours
a
deep
black
body
with
two
fingers
of
light
khaki
foam
which
fades
away
quickly
leaving
behind
a
thin
and
frail
cap
decent
lacing
with
poor
retention
aroma
is
strong
on
the
milk
chocolate
with
lighter
notes
of
coffee
roast
and
some
grainy
oats
taste
is
similar
with
a
predominately
milk
chocolate
flavor
with
light
roasty
malts
and
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
on
the
thinner
side
of
things
leading
the
beer
to
be
somewhat
lacking
really
needs
more
body
to
support
the
chocolate
overall
a
bit
of
a
thin
example
of
the
style
but
still
rather
tasty
and
enjoyable
not
bad
at
all

poured
into
nonic
pint
glass
almost
black
with
two
fingers
of
tan
colored
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
follows
the
nose
exceptionally
well
balanced
the
roasty
flavors
are
there
but
they
dont
overpower
the
sweet
and
chocolatey
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
what
really
sets
this
one
apart
rich
smooth
and
creamy
dry
finish
with
moderate
bitterness
perfect
example
of
what
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
i
think
ill
be
reaching
for
this
one
often
o
not
sure
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
or
my
palate
has
developed
to
favor
the
ipas
that
ive
been
drinking
for
the
past
year
ive
had
some
stouts
that
i
loved
founders
but
this
one
falls
flat
for
me
o
this
beer
is
solid
but
not
terrific
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
o
what
a
great
stout
not
high
in
abv
but
packed
with
flavor
love
the
roasted
smoked
flavor
in
this
as
well
overall
a
very
solid
nofrills
representation
of
the
style
thats
just
bold
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
id
pick
this
up
once
in
a
while
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
recommended
riley
and
jakes
is
a
famiily
restaurant
with
a
typical
american
pub
menu
the
food
is
fine
for
this
type
of
restaurant
and
the
place
gets
quite
busy
on
the
weekends
o
very
good
oatmeal
stout
pretty
straight
forward
but
very
creamy
with
roast
and
sweetness
oi
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
oatmeal
stout
very
well
made
and
with
nice
balance
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
the
sweetness
of
oats
dominates
like
it
should
in
this
style
the
coffee
and
chocolate
are
also
very
stong
one
can
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
the
flavor
is
light
yet
very
satisfying
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
prevent
you
from
having
several
of
these
delicious
brews
thought
i
had
this
beer
before
but
i
didnt
what
a
wonderful
sexy
smooth
creamy
beer
with
chocolate
and
hints
of
coffee
wow
what
a
taste
just
loving
this
beer
yummy
so
drink
up
amd
smile
because
when
this
goes
down
your
happy
a
winter
beer
that
your
sure
you
will
enjoy
o
i
like
it
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
worth
revisiting
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
chestnut
highlighted
brown
color
with
a
tall
frothy
lightweight
light
tan
head
that
starts
tall
but
quickly
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
of
retaining
head
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
grains
and
a
creamy
sweetness
smells
solid
and
tasty
flavors
are
roasted
coffee
backbone
with
bitter
and
roasty
characters
overall
chocolate
overtones
that
lean
more
towards
bitter
and
dark
than
the
milk
chocolate
that
was
present
on
the
nose
the
beer
is
light
and
dry
in
mouth
with
the
bitterness
giving
is
a
slightly
sharp
very
clean
finish
tangy
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
with
the
bittersweet
chocolate
cutting
that
quickly
very
good
tasty
dynamic
layered
stout
lower
abv
keeps
the
drinkability
high
solid
brew
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
a
faint
garnet
brown
highlight
when
held
to
light
a
smallish
off
white
head
froths
then
quickly
recedes
leaving
spotty
lace
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
from
this
beer
is
quite
intoxicating
toasty
and
roasty
grains
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
balanced
by
a
bit
of
earth
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
roasty
and
chocolate
with
bits
of
bread
caramel
and
toffee
theres
a
light
fruity
sweetness
with
enough
dry
roastiness
to
provide
great
balance
light
earthy
hop
flavor
with
little
to
no
apparent
hop
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
grainy
roasty
mouthfeel
this
beer
smells
incredible
and
tastes
pretty
good
too
overall
a
tasty
creamy
and
satisfying
oatmeal
stout
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
a
rich
enjoyable
stout
this
is
how
a
stout
should
feel
look
and
taste
id
recommend
it
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
o
surprisingly
delicious
at
room
temperature
a
quality
oatmeal
stout
oda
combination
of
highs
and
lows
but
in
the
end
this
is
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
plenty
to
like
and
the
good
outweighs
the
bad
in
the
end
despite
its
relatively
minor
flaws
this
is
a
good
time
in
a
bottle
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
o
for
8
99
this
is
a
pretty
decent
stout
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
more
oatmeal
flavors
but
still
nice
nonetheless
nothing
amazing
but
worthy
of
a
try
ok
like
this
is
brown
dark
and
it
is
that
simple
no
need
to
get
fancy
smooth
toasty
and
creamy
nicely
done
oh
you
want
to
know
about
the
taste
well
roasted
and
toasted
very
well
and
leaves
the
mouthtongue
clean
the
feel
on
the
mouth
is
give
me
more
and
refreshing
to
boot
overall
this
is
a
well
brewed
oatmeal
stout
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
fairly
chewy
slightly
oily
if
only
the
aroma
was
indicative
of
what
was
to
come
in
the
bottle
a
very
nice
representative
of
the
style
and
surely
deserves
a
second
or
third
visit
d
i
feel
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
although
the
aroma
is
really
what
stands
out
id
take
this
over
sam
smith
any
day
of
the
week
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
market
basket
in
somersworth
pours
a
murky
dark

a
good
inch
of
khakicolored
head
leaving
some
decent
stickage
toast
and
espresso
waft
from
the
glass
toast
espresso
beans
nut
and
a
dash
of
dark
chocolate
flood
the
palate
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
wow
for
this
just
being
an
oatmeal
stout
this
is
truly
stellar
seek
this
one
out
this
is
very
very
delicious
i
will
get
this
again
for
sure
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
of
i
have
ever
had
highly
recommend
d
nicely
robust
with
plenty
of
character
and
a
strong
oatmeal
aspect
good
interplay
between
the
dark
roast
and
the
oatmeal
malt
sweetness
nicely
balancing
hops
lots
of
flavor
and
very
drinkable
this
is
quite
nice
overall
the
coffee
flavour
was
too
much
for
me
if
you
really
like
coffee
youll
like
this
otherwise
probably
not
as
much
o
this
was
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
that
had
great
smooth
balance
between
the
flavors
nice
sweetness
could
maybe
be
a
tiny
bit
sweeter
but
overall
very
well
done
o
this
beer
walked
like
a
duck
quacked
like
a
duck
but
couldnt
swim
thats
just
not
right
folks
this
beer
is
winona
ryder
when
youre
looking
for
jennifer
lopez
or
jennifer
hudson
or
fergie
for
that
matter
its
okay
but
lacks
the
bamboompow
that
you
really
want
mercifully
i
have
a
few
really
good
stouts
in
the
beer
fridge
once
again
plan
b
proves
to
be
a
prudent
course
of
action
thanks
for
reading
o
a
good
stout
to
be
sure
nothing
overwhelmingly
special
but
soldly
built
and
everything
a
stout
should
be
definitely
recommend
o
i
enjoyed
this
oatmeal
stout
and
even
went
back
for
more
its
very
easy
to
drink
with
nice
roasty
flavors
that
provide
a
decent
chocolate
fix
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
coffee
roasted
malts
taste
is
coffee
up
front
some
oats
are
present
a
touch
of
chocolate
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
organic
too
pours
a
beautiful
dark
roast
coffee
color
with
a
2
inch
tan
head
smells
grainy
definitely
picking
up
the
oats
here
also
baking
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
in
the
aroma
flavor
matches
in
a
less
complex
synergy
of
the
aromatic
profile
a
little
bit
sweet
but
not
to
the
detriment
of
the
mouthfeel
which
is
fairly
carbonated
and
very
full
bodied
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
autumn
drinks
although
i
think
it
works
all
year
a
fine
example
of
the
style
im
drinking
from
a
bottle
and
the
beer
was
a
bit
tart
i
cant
be
sure
if
thats
from
shelf
life
or
the
true
taste
but
i
recommend
it
fully
and
with
gusto
i
can
only
imagine
that
drinking
this
from
a
tap
or
fresh
would
be
amazing
grab
a
sixpack
o
very
nice
i
like
this
flavor
a
little
more
than
the
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
although
not
as
bold
as
a
founders
breakfast
stout
this
beer
had
me
frustrated
for
a
good
15
minutes
while
i
tried
to
pour
it
the
amount
of
carbonation
was
insane
and
the
fullglass
head
took
forever
to
dissipate
enough
to
pour
out
the
entire
bottle
freak
bottle
i
think
once
poured
the
chocolate
and
light
roast
aroma
pulled
me
in
and
the
taste
equaled
the
aroma
a
very
nice
well
balanced
stout
carbonation
was
crazy
like
i
mentioned
and
that
made
it
feel
a
bit
different
on
the
palate
m
medium
bodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
o
samuel
smiths
had
a
nicer
head
and
lacing
and
was
definitely
the
creamier
of
the
two
but
this
oatmeal
stout
had
a
richer
aroma
and
flavor
i
call
it
a
tie
both
are
excellent
but
then
again
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
show
very
nice
while
not
real
low
in
alcohol
this
beer
is
certainly
no
slouch
i
think
these
get
a
bit
overshadowed
by
their
imperial
brethren
at
times
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
certainly
one
id
have
again
o
this
is
a
nice
effort
from
wolavers
im
a
big
fan
of
dark
chocolate
and
smooth
roasted
coffee
so
this
appeals
to
my
tastes
but
more
broadly
i
think
it
is
a
good
sample
of
this
style
balanced
sweet
with
a
bitter
finish
gives
plenty
of
complexity
without
leaving
you
full
overall
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
from
northern
vt
wish
i
had
time
over
thanksgiving
weekend
to
take
a
trip
not
enough
time
and
windsor
was
only
ten
minutes
away
from
where
we
staying
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
in
the
future
this
beer
poured
very
dark
and
opaque
with
a
small
and
quicklyfading
head
nose
is
barley
and
coffee
and
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
with
the
grapefruit
zest
of
the
hops
coming
forward
and
quite
a
lot
of
bitter
chocolate
flavor
as
well
as
a
splash
of
cola
towards
the
end
coffee
is
not
as
apparent
in
the
taste
as
it
was
in
the
nose
although
the
roasted
barley
is
still
there
the
major
drawback
is
that
its
light
on
the
tongue
and
not
quite
as
creamy
as
i
would
likea
good
light
drinking
stout
when
youre
in
the
mood
poured
an
almost
headless
dark
brownblack
body
minimal
lacing
of
glass
scent
is
sweet
and
unremarkable
taste
is
sweetened
coffee
bready
could
use
a
lot
more
bittering
to
balance
the
taste
is
further
a
bit
acrid
and
very
thin
feeling
on
the
palate
to
reduce
it
to
one
word
meh
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
totally
on
point
for
the
style
exactly
what
im
looking
for
when
i
want
a
standard
oatmeal
stout
as
opposed
when
i
want
a
more
extreme
american
stout
and
its
organic
too
which
is
great
if
you
enjoy
stouts
particularly
oatmeal
stouts
then
this
is
an
absolute
musttry
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
highly
highly
recommended
o
this
is
a
good
showing
for
an
oatmeal
stout
nice
crisp
flavors
and
aromas
a
slightly
heavier
body
would
help
improve
it
still
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
especially
nice
as
it
is
an
organic
o
a
really
tasty
oatmeal
stout
that
i
could
have
all
night
a
very
solid
stout
o
a
delicious
oatmeal
stout
nice
flavor
profile
id
definitely
have
another
one
a
winner
a
all
the
way
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
the
wolavers
brand
nice
looking
beer
with
a
black
color
strong
head
and
retention
good
lacing
as
well
roasted
and
creamy
aroma
some
bitter
hops
are
noticed
in
the
smell
as
well
flavor
is
very
nice
combining
the
expected
roasted
malt
taste
with
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
sort
of
molasses
sweetness
in
the
rear
i
had
this
very
fresh
and
the
herbal
piney
hops
were
prominent
nicely
creamy
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
thick
enough
to
give
it
some
substance
the
one
complaint
i
would
make
about
this
beer
is
i
felt
the
bitterness
of
the
finish
went
on
too
long
still
tasted
the
hops
about
an
hour
and
a
few
glasses
of
water
later
i
like
the
hops
but
they
dominated
the
finish
too
strongly
for
my
taste
overwhelming
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
and
kind
of
wiping
them
from
my
memory
perhaps
a
little
too
fresh
methinks
still
not
bad
o
good
clean
stout
thicker
mouthfeel
would
work
better
with
the
sharp
flavors
however
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
down
a
few
of
these
in
succession
on
any
given
night
good
beer
overall
definitely
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
ever
had
maybe
forth
best
samuel
smith
being
1
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
pretty
good
flavor
almost
borderline
sessionable
if
it
was
more
available
o
this
is
a
fine
stout
and
a
very
good
style
example
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
best
of
the
mix
pack
by
far
d
very
drinkable
stout
with
a
good
sessionable
abv
worth
looking
for
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
readily
available
stouts
it
degrades
quickly
though
and
the
flavors
arent
as
sharp
after
three
months
in
the
bottle
its
still
better
than
most
though
nice
example
of
the
style
maybe
lacks
a
bit
of
body
and
flavor
but
nothing
out
of
character
oits
good
but
i
have
had
better
ones
kinda
glad
i
didnt
get
a
6
pack
and
got
it
in
a
variety
pack
but
it
is
still
good
and
enjoy
it
i
thought
this
beer
was
enjoyable
albeit
somewhat
flawed
drinking
the
next
five
in
the
six
pack
wont
be
a
chore
but
its
also
not
something
im
eagerly
anticipating
o
wow
awesome
beer
i
was
so
pleased
with
the
complexity
and
texture
of
this
beer
it
was
rich
with
flavor
with
maintaining
such
a
rich
and
delicate
mouthfeel
excellent
oatmeal
stout
and
fantastic
beer
overall
highly
recommended
notes
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
more
bitter
than
i
remember
it
being
ive
heard
all
the
o
c
wolavers
recipes
have
been
tweaked
lately
cheers
to
that
the
middle
brew
enjoyed
by
vdubb86
and
myself
amidst
a
ghost
adventures
kick
it
pours
a
straight
obsidian
though
bordering
on
blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
coffee
dark
chocolate
molasses
and
light
maple
syrup
the
taste
holds
notes
of
roasted
malts
cocoa
light
vanilla
and
plenty
o
toasted
oats
the
body
is
a
lightaspiring
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thickly
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
rich
and
chewy
without
going
overboard
on
the
flavors
get
some
o
a
great
oatmeal
stout
overall
my
main
complaint
really
is
just
that
the
head
didnt
stay
around
long
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
it
o
pulled
this
one
randomly
off
the
shelf
because
my
son
like
the
farmer
on
the
label
what
a
great
pull
this
will
be
a
stout
i
come
back
to
time
and
time
again
reasonably
priced
nice
abv
a
great
drinking
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
perhaps
my
favorite
thing
to
drink
with
breakfast
foods
eggs
toast
bacon
and
some
hash
browns
wow
ooverall
this
a
great
beer
to
have
on
tap
i
enjoy
this
just
as
much
as
founders
breakfast
stout
but
with
less
abv
it
is
a
good
session
beer
to
have
deep
dark
brown
hue
nearly
black
under
a
slender
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
mild
coffee
and
cream
semisweet
chocolate
light
smoky
roast
dark
bittersweet
roasted
chocolate
malty
flavor
subtle
dark
fruit
and
nutty
oats
best
around
cellar
temperature
medium
bodied
a
bit
oily
and
smooth
its
been
too
long
since
ive
had
one
of
these
an
excellent
choice
for
a
sessionable
stout
12oz
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
zero
lacing
aroma
is
of
vanilla
coffee
malts
and
some
earthiness
taste
is
a
sweet
coffee
upfront
along
with
more
vanilla
and
malt
flavor
a
bit
earthy
very
easy
drinking
stout
but
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
overall
this
is
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
and
i
often
look
for
it
very
good
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
minimal
creamy
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
of
coffee
chocolate
earthy
and
slightly
smokey
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
well
carbonated
taste
is
of
nuts
coffee
some
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
smoke
pretty
decent
stout
right
here
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
so
smooth
that
its
almost
watery
clean
and
crisp
with
a
surprisingly
light
body
very
mild
carbonation
and
just
a
solid
overall
drinkability
a
definite
session
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
overall
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
decent
but
nothing
really
spectacular
for
me
the
defining
characteristic
of
oatmeal
stout
is
the
mouthfeel
and
this
comes
up
short
in
that
area
still
its
pretty
tasty
and
makes
for
a
good
sessionable
stout
to
have
a
few
pints
of
worth
trying
cheers
o
quite
good
overall
would
definitely
be
a
buy
again
id
almost
say
that
it
would
work
as
a
session
beer
but
is
a
little
high
on
the
alcohol
content
for
that
overall
this
beer
was
good
very
good
even
somehow
better
than
its
individual
averages
but
it
was
also
the
last
one
of
the
6
pack
rest
in
peace
brew
o
this
is
an
awesome
stout
it
is
so
full
of
flavor
every
sip
i
find
something
sexy
i
wanna
go
on
and
on
about
this
may
be
my
go
to
stout
from
now
on
d
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
d
very
drinkable
gives
me
hope
for
orangic
beers
as
this
one
is
enjoyable
quite
tasty
good
solid
oatmeal
stout
ff
d
very
drinkable
certainly
sessionable
would
recommend
it
and
purchase
again
this
beer
has
a
nice
roastedcoffee
aroma
to
it
and
the
aroma
matches
the
taste
real
well
the
stout
has
a
roasted
malt
flavor
and
coffee
taste
with
a
little
creaminess
also
which
is
pleasant
as
stouts
go
this
is
one
worth
drinking
for
yourself
wont
be
disappointed

drinkability
very
good
stout
highly
drinkable
would
most
definitely
recommend
this
beer
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
lot2841111510
sampled
on
january
27
2011
the
pour
is
a
rich
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
hues
and
a
generous
one
inch
silky
tan
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
bit
of
coffee
grinds
that
have
been
sitting
around
in
the
morning
pot
however
it
is
enticing
in
that
way
little
in
the
way
of
hops
though
the
texture
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
it
results
in
a
coffee
grinds
taste
with
light
malts
and
a
sprinkle
of
chocolate
very
nice
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
in
my
entire
life
i
for
sure
havent
had
every
beer
in
the
world
but
so
far
this
is
the
winner
color
is
a
black
as
could
be
smell
is
amazing
smells
malty
and
smooth
just
like
a
stout
should
smell
taste
is
out
of
the
world
so
smooth
so
creamy
so
malty
so
good
and
of
course
its
drinkable
how
couldnt
it
be
with
it
tasting
that
good
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
1010
a
very
drinkable
brew
as
expected
for
the
style
would
get
a
case
of
this
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
lacks
the
looks
and
the
mouthfeel
to
make
it
stand
out
though
good
stuff
very
sessionable
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
how
smooth
the
beer
drank
as
is
afforded
in
the
making
of
an
oatmeal
stout
the
mouthfeel
becomes
delicate
and
soft
and
helps
the
beer
drink
a
bit
better
while
the
beer
had
these
characteristics
it
also
gave
off
an
unpleasantly
metallic
aroma
and
subsequent
taste
this
was
backed
by
otherwise
mildly
strong
components
which
did
little
to
fulfill
the
expectations
of
the
drinker
i
originally
tried
this
on
tap
and
i
loved
it
if
i
did
the
review
right
then
and
there
the
taste
would
have
gotten
a
perfect
score
since
im
reviewing
it
in
a
bottle
the
taste
is
slightly
off
the
score
suffered
slightly
and
i
believe
thats
why
i
feel
its
lacking
the
label
boasts
coffee
roast
malt
and
chocolate
and
delivers
on
all
promises
good
stuff
taste
reiterates
the
coffee
and
roast
malt
sentiment
woefully
watery
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
and
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
another
find
at
bradley
airport
terminal
locks
landing
this
has
a
deep
dark
black
brown
color
a
healthy
tan
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
pleasant
and
definitive
coffee
with
a
deep
mocha
sweetness
and
roasted
nuts
very
nice
the
flavor
speaks
out
with
a
tart
coffee
bitterness
while
the
chocolate
idea
settles
into
a
more
subtle
blend
with
leafy
hop
and
even
lemon
highlights
this
beer
is
a
solid
medium
bodied
to
full
bodied
deal
that
is
near
silky
in
feel
though
a
touch
thin
very
easy
drinking
and
its
organic
theres
a
hint
of
vinegar
here
that
i
might
do
without
but
it
doesnt
spoil
it
the
carbonation
is
very
delicate
but
its
adequate
for
the
style
recommended
for
a
try
smooth
and
flavorful
pitch
black
layer
of
tan
head
hangs
around
on
top
of
the
brew
for
most
of
the
glass
good
lacing
strong
chocolate
smell
faint
coffee
and
cherry
macadamia
nuts
slight
coffee
bitterness
in
the
taste
very
malt
forward
brew
with
a
great
balance
of
nuttiness
and
bakers
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
no
alcohol
noticeable
in
aroma
or
taste
smooth
textured
and
creamy
with
perfect
carbonation
and
medium
body
definitely
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
drinkability
it
has
a
think
busty
head
powerful
aromas
and
balanced
presence
makes
for
a
fabulous
experience
if
paul
bunyan
drank
beer
i
think
this
beer
might
have
made
it
onto
the
menu
md
creamy
velvety
oatmeal
stouts
almost
always
excel
at
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
to
drink
by
itself
or
with
dessert
dlittle
bro
didnt
steer
me
wrong
this
requires
an
additional
sampling
d
rich
flavors
make
this
an
easy
one
to
drink
its
kinda
hard
to
only
have
one
d
incredible
for
such
a
strong
flavored
beer
the
flavor
really
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palette
even
after
1
pint
is
gone
as
happens
with
some
stouts
i
guess
that
means
its
time
for
another
great
beer
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
chocolaty
sweetness
and
bitter
roast
with
the
roast
winning
out
by
a
hair
provides
a
rich
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
necessarily
creamy
there
is
a
definite
hop
presence
on
the
finish
along
with
a
little
bit
of
raisin
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
a
sixpack
of
this
could
disappear
in
a
hurry
in
my
fridge
probably
makes
my
top
5
oatmeal
stouts
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
when
i
picked
it
up
when
it
comes
to
stouts
i
either
love
them
or
hate
them
this
one
though
is
definitely
a
love
great
beer
and
has
some
elements
to
it
that
all
stouts
should
strive
for
would
love
to
see
an
aged
version
of
this
i
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
overall
a
decent
and
drinkable
brew
but
not
quite
up
there
where
the
air
is
rare
some
misfires
but
still
likable
worth
a
try
d
easily
drinkable
all
night
f
some
bitterness
again
mostly
from
the
roasted
earthy
malts
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
too
lingering
roasted
malt
flavors
some
smooth
oatmeal
still
a
little
dark
chocolate
even
touch
of
caramel
and
sweetness
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
oatmeal
stout
being
organic
doesnt
mean
much
to
me
but
being
a
sessionable
smooth
and
tasty
oatmeal
stout
for
cheap
and
somewhat
local
great
in
my
opinion
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
is
the
beer
version
of
coffee
i
love
it
d
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
very
nutty
flavor
but
not
without
its
share
of
hops
almost
too
much
for
this
style
to
me
malt
is
roasted
to
give
this
beer
a
strong
bite
to
it
almost
coffeelike
body
is
a
fullmedium
but
not
entirely
smooth
very
good
oatmeal
stout
but
not
perfect
maybe
just
a
little
too
much
of
the
bitter
hops
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
pretty
dry
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
the
roasted
flavor
is
pretty
strong
but
satisfying
d
the
complex
flavor
and
the
relatively
light
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
great
drinking
stout
badass
pairing
with
a
bowl
of
genericbrand
frosted
miniwheats
classy
i
know
pours
dark
brown
small
tan
head
quickly
fizzes
away
to
a
thin
ring
leaves
lace
dots
so
small
they
are
barely
visible
to
the
human
eye
great
smell
fresh
roasted
coffee
up
front
with
a
bit
of
caramellike
sweetness
taste
is
pretty
weak
compared
to
the
nose
but
the
nice
flavors
make
up
for
it
coffee
is
definitely
the
main
thing
going
on
chocolate
oat
come
through
more
so
as
its
going
down
a
decent
amount
of
hops
a
bit
of
vanilla
sweetness
starts
to
show
through
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
almost
feels
watery
thin
at
times
but
this
isnt
exactly
a
highbody
beer
anyway
and
it
makes
it
very
drinkable
spiky
carbonation
is
a
problem
at
first
but
gets
alot
smoother
once
it
seems
to
go
away
after
a
bit
or
maybe
i
just
got
used
to
it
an
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
that
is
pretty
easydrinking
d
very
pleasant
a
good
stout
that
doesnt
sacrifice
taste
for
drinkability
this
is
my
first
from
wolovers
now
i
know
it
will
not
be
my
last
big
flavor
light
body
make
this
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
to
keep
on
hand
and
share
with
friends
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
that
is
easy
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
it
is
certainly
a
winner
in
the
oatmeal
stout
category
not
to
mention
it
seems
to
be
very
easy
to
find
d
the
aftertaste
that
was
left
on
my
palate
really
did
not
make
me
want
to
have
another
it
could
be
me
the
initial
taste
is
pleasant
but
the
lingering
aftertaste
was
not
for
me
anyway
d
tasty
and
a
low
abv
but
nothing
too
special
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
red
highlights
there
is
a
very
small
tan
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
aftertaste
is
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
and
is
not
creamy
as
i
expected
low
carbonation
notes
the
taste
is
somewhat
bitterer
than
i
expected
out
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
problem
as
i
mentioned
above
is
the
mouthfeel
far
too
thin
and
carbonated
its
not
as
smooth
as
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
either
oh
well
for
fifty
cents
it
was
an
outstanding
deal
and
i
have
no
right
to
complain
ive
been
excited
to
try
this
beer
since
portia99
sent
it
an
organic
oatmeal
stout
that
sounds
amazing
alas
i
was
to
be
disappointed
perhaps
this
was
an
infected
bottle
perhaps
there
is
a
percentage
sour
mash
either
way
it
does
not
work
it
offends
with
its
glowing
amber
highlights
an
oatmeal
stout
i
expect
some
nice
body
not
a
beer
that
seems
to
be
worried
about
its
weight
its
an
oatmeal
stout
on
a
diet
with
a
little
sour
funk
i
hope
the
funk
is
purposeful
regardless
i
am
not
a
fan
perhaps
i
will
try
this
again
perhaps
i
will
be
saddened
again
d
would
make
a
great
session
beer
kind
of
onenote
but
its
a
pleasant
one
with
no
major
flaws
that
goes
down
nicely
poured
an
attractive
deep
black
with
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
strong
with
a
heavy
dose
of
roasted
coffee
beans
taste
is
the
same
tons
of
roastiness
with
some
bitter
chocolate
as
well
earthy
hop
undertones
balance
this
one
out
nicely
i
love
the
taste
of
the
beer
but
could
understand
it
being
too
much
for
others
body
is
ok
not
as
thick
as
i
would
like
but
not
too
thin
to
detract
from
the
beer
great
taste
plus
average
abv
high
drinkability
i
pick
up
a
6er
or
two
whenever
im
in
vermont
a
real
standout
in
the
wolavers
line
pitch
black
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
cocoa
powder
taste
is
chocolateweak
coffeecola
and
some
smoked
malts
a
decent
beer
that
is
a
little
weak
on
flavor
and
a
bit
watery
on
mouthfeel
still
this
is
something
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
i
believe
that
i
would
purchase
this
again
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ill
admit
overall
i
wish
this
were
creamier
and
sweeter
as
you
might
expect
of
an
oatmeal
stout
id
go
for
a
nice
zyweic
porter
or
even
a
turbodog
before
this
were
i
trapped
in
a
cabin
on
a
dark
cold
night
and
wanted
something
dark
and
hearty
to
cheer
me
up
but
quite
a
good
beer
nonetheless
and
quite
a
good
price
if
you
like
hoppy
drier
dark
ales
you
would
like
this
amy
tried
to
give
one
to
nate
and
kaylie
who
are
really
light
bear
corona
drinkers
it
was
pretty
amusing
to
see
their
faces
nate
kept
saying
how
good
it
tasted
but
his
face
told
a
different
story
they
drank
it
from
a
bottle
though
which
i
mentioned
would
not
allow
it
to
be
smelled
properly
dthe
roasted
quality
is
just
too
much
for
me
in
this
one
i
tried
this
about
4
months
ago
and
i
figured
a
little
age
would
mellow
the
coffeeroastiness
it
didnt
at
all
id
be
hard
pressed
to
try
this
again
a
nice
low
abv
is
always
welcome
but
at
what
cost
lesser
flavor
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
may
not
pick
uo
more
of
this
a
oatmeal
stout
should
be
a
bit
sweet
with
some
chocolate
imo
and
i
got
non
of
that
im
tired
im
going
to
bed
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
that
could
be
bumped
up
to
the
next
level
with
a
thicker
smoother
body
d
solid
oatmeal
stout
i
could
drink
a
couple
but
i
would
get
full
pretty
quickly
dont
skip
this
one
due
to
fears
of
an
organic
brew
being
subpar
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
the
best
organic
stout
ive
tried
picked
up
a
single
at
php
in
brookline
poured
into
a
great
divide
yeti
glass
very
dark
brown
color
nice
looking
tan
head
really
aromatic
smell
of
roasted
barley
taste
was
immense
reminded
me
of
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
dark
roasted
barley
and
malt
flavors
abound
really
had
that
super
oatmeal
flavor
to
it
this
is
a
great
characteristic
but
i
wonder
if
they
didnt
overdo
it
by
just
a
little
too
much
its
a
smooth
beer
but
the
flavor
is
really
upfront
and
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
want
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
stout
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
paired
nicely
with
a
bowl
of
homemade
beef
chili
this
is
the
second
wolavers
that
i
have
had
this
month
that
has
really
impressed
me
with
its
intense
flavor
d
im
pretty
impressed
by
this
oatmeal
stout
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
wolavers
but
this
is
wellcrafted
beer
all
around
im
digging
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
working
in
tandem
with
a
pleasantly
fruity
character
in
all
a
fresh
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
guinness
glass
a
dark
brownnearblack
with
less
than
a
finger
of
beige
head
the
smell
was
one
of
cocoa
powder
caramel
oak
and
nuts
and
while
the
taste
did
confirm
all
of
this
it
was
very
very
subdued
furthermore
i
found
the
feel
to
be
a
little
too
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
sessionable
yes
but
not
strong
enough
of
a
flavor
for
me
d
very
good
organic
stout
goes
down
really
well
for
a
darker
beer
this
guy
gets
a
big
stamp
of
stamp
of
approval
from
me
not
least
of
all
because
its
a
surprisingly
good
value
pours
a
deep
brown
a
small
tan
head
has
a
fascinating
sourness
on
the
nose
and
palate
that
i
enjoy
immensely
the
oatmeal
element
also
shines
through
loud
and
proud
theres
something
very
raw
and
unrefined
about
this
beer
that
keeps
it
from
scoring
in
the
stratosphere
but
makes
it
a
very
solid
choice
that
i
intend
to
revisit
time
and
again
it
is
organic
i
guess
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
a
very
good
stout
i
like
this
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
something
i
would
recommend
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
dry
with
only
a
slight
oatmeal
feel
to
it
this
beer
has
enough
flavor
and
an
intense
aroma
that
can
keep
me
interested
for
a
few
pints
im
surprised
this
beer
weighs
in
at
5
9
abv
i
would
guess
it
was
less
than
5
12
oz
dark
brown
pour
not
real
opaque
pleasant
roast
malt
aroma
some
chocolates
body
is
fuller
than
the
appearance
would
lend
one
to
believe
solid
medium
body
with
the
creamy
oatmeal
or
rye
like
body
body
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
left
hand
terraryzed
taste
is
nicely
balanced
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
5
9
abv
would
not
assume
it
is
even
that
high
pleasant
drinker
definetely
one
of
the
best
organic
stouts
and
brews
period
ive
had
the
mouth
is
a
tad
thin
i
prefer
a
little
more
depth
in
my
stouts
creamy
as
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
a
bit
off
its
got
some
roasty
chocolate
flavors
present
but
it
finishes
tart
and
sour
slightly
bready
but
theres
a
weird
metallic
twang
in
there
that
i
am
not
digging
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
beer
as
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
fell
short
d
as
drinkable
as
an
oatmeal
stout
can
possibly
be
d
i
think
its
very
drinkable
not
real
thick
like
other
stouts
so
its
a
good
drinker
i
will
most
likely
keep
this
on
hand
as
often
as
i
can
but
certainly
drinkable
sessionable
a
good
enough
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
approachable
im
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
this
thanks
to
the
awesomeness

papat444
in

a
nicely
designed
oatmeal
stout
which
is
style
few
brewers
seem
attracted
to
these
days
very
drinkable
stout
the
oatmeal
is
what
makes
this
beer
as
nice
as
it
is
in
my
opinion
mildly
drinkable
sometimes
the
coffee
flavor
is
too
much
it
tastes
great
enough
that
im
almost
out
of
this
beer
already
im
not
even
trying
to
down
it
its
just
really
good
poured
out
of
brown
12
oz
bottle
bottled
on
2309
into
my
hefe
buffalo
bills
glass
pours
almost
black
with
a
some
ruby
colors
when
held
up
to
the
light
some
creamy
off
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
some
nice
sticky
lacing
in
the
aroma
roasty
malts
oatmeal
coffee
chocolate
perhaps
even
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
again
roasty
malts
some
creaminess
from
the
oats
a
touch
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
the
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
which
is
perfect
drinkability
pretty
good
a
tasty
stout
but
a
little
on
the
light
side
a
little
disappointed
with
the
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
to
me
not
very
stout
like
if
it
were
a
little
more
heavily
bodied
it
would
be
a
great
beer
right
now
its
just
good
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
but
if
i
come
across
id
drink
it
again
d
not
too
much
bad
about
this
brew
has
plenty
of
the
things
i
like
in
a
good
stout
maybe
a
handful
of
oats
would
help
move
this
guy
along
even
better
i
do
like
the
hop
presence
and
overall
flavors
good
beer
d
a
decent
enough
oatmeal
stout
d
id
have
another
and
maybe
another
very
similar
to
a
number
of
porters
ive
tried
this
would
make
a
great
breakfast
beermapleflavored
oatmeal
and
a
cup
of
coffee
all
in
one
bottle
i
recommend
this
as
one
of
the
most
flavorful
organic
brews
ive
had
pours
a
dark
chocolaty
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
strong
rich
malty
with
an
overtone
of
fine
roast
coffee
lively
malty
flavor
has
nutty
and
smoky
hints
and
an
undertone
of
fine
coffee
texture
is
smooth
and
tingly
a
little
thick
leaving
a
sassy
finish
d
i
liked
it
as
a
different
stout
that
was
not
sweet
im
going
to
have
to
disagree
with
the
bros
on
this
one
sweet
roast
and
smell
of
carbonation
come
through
first
bitter
hops
define
this
flavor
in
my
opinion
with
some
coffee
and
molasses
in
back
of
taste
this
really
reminds
me
of
a
thin
porter
not
what
you
look
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
i
really
want
to
like
these
organic
beers
too
but
this
one
didnt
cut
it
for
me
a
black
body
w
no
light
coming
through
thick
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lace
and
slowly
dies
the
sweet
malt
aroma
is
strong
with
this
oatmeal
stout
and
i
dont
really
pick
up
any
hops
mediumbodied
a
tad
syrupy
but
very
smooth
thanks
to
the
oat
malts
and
the
malts
in
the
taste
come
on
strong
with
some
cocoa
toffee
hint
of
caramel
and
some
roasted
malts
although
there
is
no
dryburnt
taste
even
in
the
backbite
hops
are
almost
an
afterthought
judging
by
other
reviews
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
good
sample
flat
beerold
kegdirty
tap
the
sweetness
was
there
but
the
hops
and
dry
malt
sensation
expected
wasnt
leaving
the
beer
a
little
lacking
in
my
opinion
the
perfect
winter
beer
i
can
drink
these
all
night
long
fantastic
in
a
growler
from
the
brewery
in
middlebury
vt
m
d
a
little
light
more
slick
than
creamy
but
with
a
flavour
so
big
it
could
be
a
little
much
if
it
were
to
be
creamy
that
said
it
does
seem
to
have
a
little
trouble
balancing
the
flavour
and
feel
id
expect
something
would
work
out
a
little
better
it
has
wonderful
potential
and
i
love
the
aroma
of
it
but
its
not
quite
for
my
palate
for
once
i
can
say
an
oatmeal
stout
actually
tastes
like
well
oats
ive
had
a
few
in
the
past
which
were
just
stouts
but
i
had
one
sip
of
this
and
it
tasted
like
a
warm
hearty
breakfast
nice
and
creamy
with
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
tons
of
lacing
and
a
nice
dark
color
to
it
the
best
ive
had
yet
from
wolavers
i
dont
really
care
about
the
whole
organic
part
but
as
a
beer
its
well
above
average
d
very
drinkable
not
too
high
in
abv
and
the
flavors
blend
very
well
also
love
the
organic
factor
to
it
very
drinkable
but
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
solid
hearty
stout
tonight
might
just
be
one
of
those
nights
and
i
think
ill
have
another
a
great
beer
to
be
honest
im
often
wary
of
anything
that
is
marketed
as
organic
but
this
was
a
wonderful
stout
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
makes
me
love
outmeal
stouts
and
reminds
me
that
something
doesnt
have
to
push
the
boundaries
of
what
beer
is
to
be
complex
and
interesting
drinkability
a
decent
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
plus
its
mostly
organic
doesnt
that
make
you
feel
good
i
know
it
does
me
well
carbonated
light
in
body
this
is
a
crisp
flavorful
and
quaffable
beer
d
a
very
drinkable
and
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
is
a
good
value
very
enjoyable
so
much
so
i
had
a
second
writing
this
review
my
first
review
here
at
ba
pours
rather
thin
a
light
colored
for
an
oatmeal
stout
really
thin
head
as
well
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
of
carmelized
sugar
and
fresh
biscuits
flavor
is
strongly
of
charred
marshmallows
and
pithy
grapefruit
rinds
a
hint
of
sweetness
dances
in
and
out
occasionally
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
and
lacks
the
oily
feel
of
many
oatmeal
stouts
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
qualities
it
lacks
keeps
me
from
wanting
another

d
overall
this
is
a
solidly
made
oatmeal
stout
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
tasty
nonetheless
d
this
is
a
very
nicely
done
oatmeal
stout
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
style
nice
to
have
it
fresh
on
tap
reccommended
taste
mouthfeel
sweet
and
rich
mildly
roasted
and
toasted
almost
hot
chocolatelike
hints
of
coffee
toward
the
finish
a
little
bit
of
leafy
hop
appears
in
the
background
but
this
is
a
decidedly
malty
brew
pretty
damn
decent
stuff
really
and
ill
give
it
some
bonus
points
for
being
organic
bottle
thanks
to
mark
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
lightbrown
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
loads
of
coffee
rich
burnt
malts
and
lots
of
nutty
notes
the
flavor
was
also
very
good
up
front
coffee
and
rich
chocolates
some
roasted
malts
and
a
dry
sweet
finish
the
oats
and
roasted
flavors
along
with
the
nice
abv
add
a
real
heft
to
this
beer
very
nice
the
only
critique
i
have
is
it
is
a
bit
too
thin
but
very
nice
overall
meh
i
will
drink
all
6
but
its
got
some
work
to
do
drinkability
is
lacking
a
bit
the
bitterness
and
dry
finish
take
away
from
the
malt
complexity
and
disconnects
the
finish
from
the
initial
impression
of
the
profile
what
is
left
is
a
semiflabby
attempt
at
a
stout
that
falls
short
of
a
complete
brew
in
the
end
it
was
a
little
tough
to
get
down
as
enjoyably
as
the
first
sip
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
balck
with
some
reddish
hues
and
a
minimal
cream
head
smells
like
coffee
and
roasted
malts
tastes
bitter
like
carbonated
coffee
did
i
mention
i
dont
like
coffee
i
got
this
in
a
trade
and
i
would
never
buy
i
love
a
good
stout
but
not
one
that
is
has
such
a
dominant
coffee
taste
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
falls
to
nothing
nose
is
a
gentle
roasted
thing
with
a
fairly
thick
cocoa
edge
flavor
is
roasted
cocoa
and
a
bitter
on
the
back
end
really
excellent
flavor
ride
feel
is
liquid
smooth
and
carbonation
is
as
well
like
i
said
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
and
it
just
happens
to
be
organic
d
amazing
moutfeel
and
delicious
flavor
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
and
is
highly
recommended
onyx
black
with
red
highlights
if
held
to
the
light
tan
head
and
a
full
three
fingers
thick
head
that
fades
to
a
clingy
cap
laces
very
well
yummy
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
and
malt
good
flavors
of
mocha
straight
coffee
and
generally
quite
drinkable
medium
to
heavy
body
but
could
be
heavier
for
what
it
is
smooth
despite
the
medium
carbonation
its
a
good
stout
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
slightly
lacking
in
gumption
a
good
effort
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
deep
brown
that
was
very
slightly
translucent
head
was
slight
with
a
mocha
brown
color
that
disappeared
very
quickly
strongest
smell
was
that
of
oatmeal
cookies
but
also
had
a
bit
of
a
bitter
alcohol
aroma
taste
was
toasted
oatmeal
bread
with
a
small
touch
of
vanilla
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
but
slightly
thin
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
and
over
tingly
carbonation
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
these
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
drinkable
but
fairly
forgettable
for
me
paired
at
flying
saucer
with
their
mud
island
dessert
served
a
dark
notquite
opaque
black
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
slight
roasted
malts
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
abundant
roasted
malts
cocoa
and
caramel
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
while
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
just
dont
see
myself
seeking
it
out
again
t
wonderful
dark
chocolate
hits
the
tongue
on
the
first
sip
then
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
comes
through
good
carbonation
is
still
retained
in
the
bottle
mouthfeel
has
lessened
over
time
from
memory
as
it
now
feels
quite
thin
almost
porterlike
now
moreso
than
a
stout
but
the
finish
is
wonderfully
long
bitter
and
dry
the
roastyness
just
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
more
mfd
decent
carbonation
and
easy
enough
to
drink
mfd
thin
for
a
stout
but
slightly
sticky
which
coated
the
mouth
well
mild
carbonation
that
goes
down
smooth
normally
i
dont
consider
stouts
session
beers
because
of
the
heavy
body
but
this
one
qualifies
due
to
the
thin
to
medium
body
and
creamy
drinkability
good
beer
not
a
session
beer
though
definitely
best
served
not
too
cold
coffee
galore
very
very
toasty
nice
ruby
color
in
a
glass
with
a
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
as
darkblack
beer
goes
this
is
an
affordable
choice
that
does
well
on
its
own
drink
warm
if
you
drink
it
too
cold
youll
miss
out
on
tons
of
aroma
and
flavor
d
nice
normal
stout
fairly
easy
drinking
nothing
remarkable
just
a
decent
stout
d
blah
its
okay
but
probably
wont
pick
up
another
by
choice
d
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
only
with
the
above
things
in
mind
on
tap
at
the
brewery
it
was
definitely
a
beer
that
was
worth
picking
up
at
home
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
some
of
the
character
i
originally
noticed
definitely
recommended
wolavers
continues
to
outshine
otter
creek
brews
with
the
exception
of
the
stovepipe
porter
they
should
amend
the
slogan
to
read
certified
organic
and
bona
fide
delicious
the
smell
was
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
molasses
flavor
with
a
bitterness
to
finish
it
had
a
cold
coffee
bitterness
to
it
on
the
finish
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
definitely
the
best
organic
one
i
have
had
to
date
poured
from
a
bottle
its
a
dark
nearly
black
beer
the
head
is
a
creamy
offwhite
but
its
fairly
thin
and
dissipates
quickly
like
most
oatmeal
stouts
the
nose
is
quite
mild
and
has
a
faint
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
much
more
substantial
than
the
nose
and
consists
of
well
roasted
but
not
burnt
malt
coffee
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
at
the
very
end
you
can
finally
taste
some
hops
its
a
rich
but
not
overly
bitter
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
suitably
thick
and
smooth
some
have
said
its
even
a
bit
oily
and
i
cant
say
i
disagree
i
think
a
better
description
would
be
slippery
drinkability
is
high
though
as
filling
as
this
beer
is
i
dont
know
how
many
you
could
actually
drink
but
youd
definitely
want
to
have
more
drinkability
one
of
the
better
domestics
in
my
opinion
fairly
cheap
a
nice
sessionable
abv
goes
down
really
smoothly
and
enough
flavor
to
make
it
complex
without
being
overbearing
got
this
one
cause
it
sounded
more
interesting
than
the
standard
yuengling
bmc
stuff
at
a
random
bar
in
dc
the
other
night
it
was
although
not
really
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
some
brown
highlights
and
a
thin
head
that
dissolves
too
fast
nose
was
fairly
mild
lots
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
and
maybe
a
touch
of
oatmeal
in
there
taste
is
similar
a
little
weak
but
pretty
good
lots
of
roasted
malt
some
coffee
extremely
drying
feel
is
pretty
good
thick
and
fairly
full
overall
not
terrible
but
not
great
a
good
starter
oatmeal
stout
maybe
recommended
to
be
sure
pretty
solid
overall
this
is
a
decent
outmeal
stout
but
by
no
means
brilliant
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
wont
let
in
much
light
through
the
glass
with
a
minimal
head
hardly
any
lacing
and
a
watery
rind
as
the
beer
warms
the
smell
is
burnt
malts
chocolate
and
mostly
coffee
actually
lots
of
coffee
the
beer
is
surprisingly
watery
medium
bodied
but
not
your
thick
consistency
that
i
would
have
expected
the
beer
is
somewhat
tilted
towards
the
malt
end
of
the
spectrum
although
the
hops
present
themselves
towards
the
finish
there
arent
as
many
balancing
hops
in
the
body
that
i
would
have
preferred
the
taste
is
decidedly
burnt
malts
charred
molasses
cold
coffee
some
cocoa
there
is
some
complexity
to
this
beer
and
a
bit
of
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
there
is
an
overlay
of
oilyness
that
adds
to
the
beers
complexity
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
shades
of
burgandy
when
held
up
to
the
light
small
light
brown
head
that
vaguely
sticks
around
smells
very
roasty
lots
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
grains
great
aroma
taste
is
good
as
well
roastiness
some
dark
chocolatecocoa
slight
hop
bitterness
in
finish
slightly
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
heavy
a
tad
thin
lots
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
body
was
mid
with
a
nice
body
to
stand
on
i
think
that
this
beer
could
have
been
find
but
i
would
have
like
to
see
more
chocolate
and
less
oatmeal
good
but
ill
stick
with
ipswich
for
my
oatmeal
stout
of
choice
like
many
oatmeal
stouts
it
should
be
kept
cold
but
often
tastes
better
when
allowed
to
sit
at
room
temperature
before
drinking
it
if
you
cant
wait
as
i
often
cant
its
best
to
slip
it
slowly
to
experience
the
beer
at
different
temperatures
this
isnt
difficult
to
do
since
as
an
outmeal
stout
its
somewhat
heavy
and
fairly
filling
moreys
bottom
line
i
remember
how
easy
this
stout
seemed
to
go
down
the
first
time
that
i
had
it
just
as
easy
this
time
very
drinkable
stout
for
sure
pours
a
rich
burnt
mahogany
color
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
aroma
consists
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dried
fruit
taste
is
mainly
coffee
and
roasted
malts
with
a
fruity
hop
bitterness
that
provides
great
balance
and
complexity
as
it
warms
very
slick
mouthfeel
for
the
style
as
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
with
only
a
mild
coffee
and
hop
aftertaste
i
could
do
a
6pack
of
these
no
problem
pours
a
black
color
with
muted
amber
and
brown
around
the
edges
with
a
burst
of
carbonation
that
rises
in
the
glass
from
a
full
pour
a
dark
colored
large
foamy
head
a
fine
looking
brew
and
on
par
for
a
stout
aroma
is
roasty
noticably
hoppy
though
not
overwhelmingly
so
both
milky
and
sweet
aromas
underly
the
roastiness
concerned
that
this
will
taste
too
jagged
for
my
tastes
from
the
aroma
taste
is
very
full
and
as
it
goes
down
its
smooth
nary
a
trast
of
harshness
its
gently
hoppy
the
hops
keep
up
but
no
more
and
leave
the
flavor
to
the
malts
which
is
much
like
the
smell
roasty
but
no
char
very
appealing
with
a
subtle
sweetness
bingo
flavors
are
subtle
but
complexity
without
needing
to
be
a
big
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
just
outstandingly
creamy
and
somehow
both
full
on
the
tongue
and
yet
not
syrupy
or
unpleasant
but
medium
bodied
in
consistency
masterful
overall
a
great
stout
that
i
originally
felt
was
too
dark
and
bitter
early
on
but
now
that
i
apreciate
darker
beers
more
this
will
be
one
of
the
the
ones
i
stock
this
one
will
win
out
over
even
sn
stout
in
my
fridge
very
tasty
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
here
some
nice
charred
edge
to
the
malt
and
of
course
coffee
finishes
with
a
refreshing
bitterness
that
never
interferes
with
the
enjoyment
of
this
smooth
beer
and
probably
keeps
me
from
draining
the
glass
in
one
motion
im
going
to
give
credit
to
the
oats
for
the
light
residual
sweetness
and
the
silky
nature
of
the
body
my
tongue
is
luxuriating
in
finish
leaves
my
mouth
lightly
dry
with
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
really
nicely
done
tasty
great
feel
and
extremely
drinkable
it
could
have
a
fuller
body
but
in
that
case
id
probably
drop
the
drinkability
score
a
touch
to
match
recommended
on
tap
at
mad
river
glen
poured
black
with
a
little
creamy
head
that
dissapated
too
quickly
smells
toasty
and
sweet
though
coffeeespresso
dominates
espresso
is
definitely
most
prominent
in
the
taste
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
lovely
oat
malt
hops
do
this
beer
well
i
havent
had
many
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
amazingly
well
balanced
enough
bitterness
to
go
round
yet
not
interfere
with
the
stouty
goodness
at
all
after
the
initial
burst
of
flavor
there
comes
a
slight
twang
of
alcohol
followed
by
the
lingering
flavor
of
burnt
toast
this
is
a
pleasant
aftertaste
i
might
add
even
though
i
dont
like
burnt
toast
a
great
oatmeal
stout
from
otter
creek
yep
its
a
keeper
steve
drinkability
i
cant
say
that
i
prefer
one
over
the
other
i
have
to
give
this
matchup
a
tie
pours
pitch
black
no
highlights
to
shine
through
i
have
this
next
to
a
glass
of
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
to
compare
and
wolavers
is
darker
for
sure
pour
creates
a
thick
creamedcoffee
head
but
with
short
retention
5
minutes
later
the
head
is
gone
but
there
remains
lace
around
the
glass
and
some
floating
islands
of
foam
smells
slightly
burnt
not
smoky
and
thin
as
if
lighter
malts
were
toasted
longer
to
force
more
color
from
them
but
with
weaker
smell
tastes
a
little
burnt
and
bitter
but
not
in
an
overall
unpleasant
way
the
body
is
thinner
compared
to
smiths
and
the
carbonation
is
stronger
and
sharper
carbonation
is
not
overdone
or
bad
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
support
or
add
creaminess
as
the
ssos
does
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
always
available
fresh
at
hannafords
pours
pitch
black
with
a
small
white
head
which
fades
quickly
aroma
is
faint
mildly
smoky
with
hints
of
burnt
coffee
beans
the
sourness
i
usually
associated
with
oatmeal
stouts
is
mildly
present
in
the
flavour
but
well
hidden
flavour
is
relatively
straightforward
smoke
mild
coffee
tangy
but
not
overbearing
hops
mouthfeels
a
little
thin
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
tangy
bittersweet
aftertaste
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
thin
but
lasting
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
rich
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
with
undertones
of
a
sweet
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
sweet
with
a
perfect
level
of
roasted
astringency
to
it
more
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
with
a
lingering
burnt
aftertaste
there
is
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
works
well
with
the
astringent
dark
malts
the
oatmeal
really
gives
this
beer
a
nice
body
and
mouthfeel
i
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
and
oh
my
this
is
some
really
black
beer
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
it
wasnt
until
the
beer
was
right
in
front
of
the
light
that
any
light
got
through
it
poured
with
a
small
amount
of
head
that
had
no
retention
and
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
intense
nutty
and
roasted
smells
come
out
and
of
course
coffee
the
taste
is
similar
definitely
some
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
could
be
described
as
chewey
imagine
eating
a
coffee
flavored
granola
bar
heavy
body
pretty
drinkable
over
all
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
beer
poured
with
a
tan
singlefinger
head
that
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
a
big
smoky
with
some
definite
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
characteristics
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
towards
the
end
it
was
very
pleasant
but
i
couldnt
imagine
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
possibly
picking
it
up
again
in
the
future
this
was
my
first
taste
of
an
organic
beer
and
i
am
quite
pleased
i
can
tell
some
good
quality
ingredients
were
used
i
would
surely
try
it
again
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
and
drew
to
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
malt
and
swee
coffee
the
taste
was
a
wonderful
mix
of
malt
and
coffee
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
on
top
the
feel
was
heavy
and
dry
i
walked
into
the
bar
at
the
borgata
one
afternoon
and
was
happy
to
just
find
a
good
macro
this
went
well
beyond
my
expectations
the
beer
was
in
great
shape
and
had
that
wonderful
sweet
and
bitter
taste
that
only
a
fine
stout
has
i
was
particularly
impressed
with
the
rich
and
complex
aromas
definately
a
beer
i
will
have
to
find
again
d
not
amazing
but
a
good
solid
stout
my
first
organic
beer
cant
even
tell
the
difference
between
a
regular
stout
and
an
organic
one
i
could
drink
this
anytime
anywhere
just
as
good
in
bottle
as
it
is
on
tap
but
i
would
always
prefer
on
tap
d
a
quite
good
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
better
but
this
one
stands
up
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
aspect
goes
down
easily
and
this
brew
does
the
job
of
satisfying
my
oatmeal
stout
craving
probably
the
best
organic
beer
ive
yet
to
sample
id
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
a
party
without
a
problem
cheers
to
wolavers
for
producing
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
with
almost
all
organic
ingredients
if
youre
an
oatmeal
stout
fan
you
best
check
this
one
out
pours
a
dark
color
with
minimal
head
from
a
growler
it
was
tightly
capped
though
aroma
is
thick
and
rich
with
hints
of
coffeeoatmeal
taste
starts
out
with
oatmeal
in
the
front
but
turns
into
more
of
a
black
coffee
finish
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
smooth
and
goes
down
very
well
roasty
as
well
nice
tastes
much
better
in
a
growler
than
it
does
in
bottles
i
would
definitely
rate
it
high
for
drinkability
for
one
thing
would
make
an
excellent
breakfast
beer
too
overall
impression
very
nicely
brewed
the
oats
give
a
slick
mouthfeel
believe
it
or
not
this
beer
was
bottled
on
101305
and
has
no
preservatives
and
not
pasteurized
and
still
was
flawless
drinkability
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
its
a
pretty
normal
oatmeal
stout
its
not
one
id
pick
up
everytime
but
when
im
in
the
mood
to
support
vermont
breweries
ill
consider
this
one
d
delicious
afterdinner
drink
mouthfeel
was
only
slightly
if
at
all
more
slickheavy
than
some
of
my
favorite
porters
i
would
have
liked
this
stout
to
come
out
a
bit
more
heavy
and
a
bit
more
slick
from
the
oats
the
carbonation
is
also
quite
abundant
and
prickly
however
overall
the
beer
tastes
good
and
is
easily
quaffable
d
i
could
enjoy
the
flavors
of
this
one
again
and
the
smell
is
great
too
but
i
really
felt
it
lacked
the
creaminess
to
push
this
beer
to
the
next
level
of
enjoyment
very
dark
with
mahogany
edges
and
ruby
highlights
the
beer
was
capped
by
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
showed
some
sticky
lacing
decent
aroma
roasty
and
nutty
with
a
little
burnt
character
and
slight
acidity
full
flavour
with
plenty
of
roast
restrained
bitterness
oat
sweetness
caramel
burnt
with
a
dark
chocolate
finish
chewy
and
full
bodied
quite
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
light
dryness
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
solid
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
some
time
a
two
month
old
sample
not
as
dark
as
expected
more
of
a
dark
brown
a
few
big
bubbles
mixed
in
with
many
tiny
fine
bubbles
smells
like
a
sweet
mocha
iced
coffee
with
floral
hop
edges
subtle
mellow
aroma
mellow
roast
flavor
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
and
lesser
hints
of
dark
fruit
dried
plums
figs
and
raisins
bittering
hops
give
a
quick
finish
the
roast
flavor
comes
back
with
the
next
sip
velvety
luscious
mouthfeel
leaving
a
very
slight
powdery
feel
on
the
tongue
high
drinkability
many
organic
brews
are
a
gimmick
wolavers
is
the
real
deal
a
must
try
very
good
stout
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
this
beer
had
very
low
head
with
minimal
lacing
very
dark
with
no
light
showing
through
smell
was
pleasant
slighly
sweet
but
little
hop
fragrance
taste
was
good
with
a
coffee
cacao
finish
not
very
bitter
little
in
the
way
of
hops
or
complexity
mouthfeel
was
medium
nothing
too
tanic
or
foamy
about
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
not
quite
on
par
with
a
samuel
smith
but
good
nevertheless
the
beer
is
straightforward
like
many
of
their
beers
so
it
is
hard
to
get
wordy
about
it
it
is
more
the
kind
of
beer
you
just
drink
and
enjoy
which
i
did
enjoyed
in
a
nice
imperial
pint
poured
dark
with
a
light
tan
head
dark
rich
appearance
almost
ebony
the
nose
is
pleasant
coffee
with
chocolate
undertones
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
one
of
the
weaker
aspects
smooth
start
and
finish
but
a
bit
to
sharp
in
between
excellent
flavor
true
stout
and
certainly
straightforward
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
little
lacking
but
not
exceptional
this
is
from
an
older
bottle
had
a
slight
psst
when
i
opened
it
poured
with
a
nice
frothy
foamy
head
that
quickly
subsided
some
lace
very
dark
brown
almost
opaque
with
some
garnet
highlights
good
malty
chocolatey
roasty
darkly
bittersweet
aroma
thats
about
the
same
as
the
flavor
great
mouth
filling
body
good
beer
very
pleasant
finish
wow
best
certified
organic
stout
ive
ever
tasted
hugely
sessionable
brew
d
i
would
get
this
beer
again
my
buddy
got
this
for
me
and
i
was
not
crazy
about
stouts
but
it
won
me
over
d
i
think
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
oatmeal
stout
it
could
do
with
a
little
bit
bigger
oatmeal
but
other
than
that
it
is
very
nice
pleasant
surprise
ontap
brought
by
consumers
beverage
at
the
buffalo
raceway
brewfest
lots
of
lace
dry
stout
could
this
be
the
oatmeal
or
a
new
addition
some
chocolate
and
coffee
and
roast
but
not
too
much
of
it
more
or
less
balanced
decent
stout
d
good
not
overpowering
flavor
is
full
and
quite
smooth
quite
a
good
oatmeal
stout
it
paired
well
with
some
after
dinner
cheeses
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
extremely
filling
good
representation
of
style
but
not
quite
up
there
with
other
oatmeal
stouts
that
ive
had
since
the
beer
is
so
filling
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
or
two
but
its
a
good
sipper
quite
drinkable
with
a
taste
that
grows
on
you
ill
have
another
ive
had
wolavers
brown
ale
and
wasnt
that
impressed
but
i
thought
id
give
the
oatmeal
stout
a
chance
poured
a
thick
opaque
black
color
with
a
dense
and
coarse
tan
head
that
rose
quickly
after
the
pour
head
dissipated
but
left
an
attractive
tan
ribbon
good
lacing
too
great
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
lots
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
some
noticeable
hops
awesome
flavors
of
coffee
chocolate
coffee
a
touch
of
hops
and
roasted
barley
coffee
is
the
dominant
flavor
here
and
its
done
very
well
a
great
offering
from
wolavers
from
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
motoroil
color
with
a
solid
foam
tan
head
the
last
bits
dripped
from
the
lip
of
the
bottle
with
the
black
gold
melting
into
the
big
head
without
a
trace
the
aroma
is
a
dessertlike
heaven
fudgelike
chocolate
bit
of
espresso
heat
the
first
swig
is
a
nice
delivery
of
toasty
coffee
as
it
warms
the
dark
bitter
chocolate
comes
through
the
java
more
assertively
but
this
is
still
a
roasty
toasty
cup
of
cold
colombian
coffee

drinkability
having
been
disappointed
by
a
number
of
the
wolavers
beers
i
was
hesitant
to
try
this
but
it
is
not
a
bad
oatmeat
stout
at
all
the
coffee
flavor
is
beguiling
and
it
has
a
nice
bitter
quality
a
bit
more
body
would
make
this
first
rate
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
is
the
second
best
otter
creekwolavers
beer
that
ive
had
to
date
otter
creek
pale
ale
still
wears
the
crown
its
a
fine
effort
that
is
good
because
it
delivers
where
it
matters
most
flavor
sessioning
this
one
should
be
no
problem
at
all
while
this
beer
has
its
imperfections
its
near
perfect
balance
of
flavors
combined
with
its
light
body
made
for
a
pleasant
and
memorable
drinking
experience
da
this
is
highly
drinkable
stuff
good
organic
cheers
from
a
twisttop
brown
bottle
with
a
bottledondate
this
vermont
brewed
organic
oatmeal
stout
poured
very
dark
brown
only
revealing
some
dark
garnet
coloring
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
tan
head
was
somewhat
thin
and
flimsy
with
a
rapid
deterioration
but
then
managed
to
maintain
a
sheet
of
foam
throughout
the
drinking
of
the
glass
there
was
little
lacing
but
what
was
there
was
thick
the
smell
is
biscuity
and
nutty
with
coffee
scents
the
taste
is
full
of
caramel
coffee
chocolate
and
toasty
slightly
smoked
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
and
then
finishes
dryly
very
drinkable
great
beer
d
a
beer
i
can
get
excited
about
considering
how
easy
it
is
for
me
to
get
its
certainly
easier
to
get
than
my
preferred
oatmeal
stout
anderson
valleys
barney
flats
so
i
can
see
adding
this
to
my
routine
its
a
pretty
bold
beer
big
on
flavor
and
easy
to
put
away
yeah
ill
have
another
please
really
really
nice
beer
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
maybe
a
tad
one
dimensional
but
maybe
not
i
like
it
will
buy
it
again
not
as
opaque
as
a
stout
should
be
more
of
a
deep
garnet
color
heavy
aroma
and
flavor
of
roasted
barley
but
not
the
body
or
smoothness
to
back
it
up
quite
malty
but
its
in
the
background
would
be
much
better
as
a
brown
ale
if
most
of
the
roast
and
black
barley
was
removed
whoa
heavy
on
the
roased
oats
i
really
dont
get
much
more
ou
of
this
beer
in
either
smell
or
taste
its
good
a
what
it
does
but
this
isn
a
terribly
complex
beer
i
tend
not
to
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
in
the
bottle
as
much
as
this
example
isnt
as
smooth
maybe
this
would
improve
on
nitro
id
still
prefer
a
sammy
smith
over
this
my
first
oatmeal
stout
delicious
it
was
on
tap
at
the
ecofestival
in
dc
a
featured
beer
as
it
is
orgainic
was
expecting
an
oatmeal
taste
but
nothing
but
coffee
and
chocolate
were
coming
though
carbonation
was
minimal
im
not
drawn
to
this
style
but
would
order
this
one
again
to
change
it
up
from
time
to
time
ok
its
starting
to
be
fall
and
let
me
tell
you
this
this
is
a
great
fall
and
winter
beer
i
am
starting
to
love
and
i
do
mean
oatmeal
stouts
and
this
is
a
damn
fine
one
if
you
want
my
homest
opinion
it
was
almost
pure
black
with
a
white
head
that
could
give
you
a
mustache
considering
it
is
all
organic
ingredients
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
good
it
was
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
than
i
would
say
make
sure
this
one
is
on
your
list
bottom
line
this
is
a
sample
of
the
style
that
everyone
should
try
given
the
chance
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
stout
that
has
a
nice
roasty
bite
to
it
and
is
coupled
with
a
sweetness
that
never
takes
over
if
it
had
a
little
more
substantial
body
to
it
i
would
be
ery
impressed
by
it
instead
its
good
but
not
great
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
not
as
smooth
as
most
but
the
sharpness
was
very
enjoyable

though
this
stout
tastes
just
a
bit
thin
at
times
its
a
very
good
small
batch
stout
over
all
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
d
there
is
good
coffee
flavors
and
some
nice
malt
complexity
to
compliment
it
but
it
is
a
shade
on
the
thin
side
this
stout
poured
out
lighter
than
a
typical
stout

more
like
a
darker
brown
ale
or
a
light
porter
the
head
was
substantial
depending
on
the
vigorousness
of
the
pour
the
oatmeal
taste
was
evident
along
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
one
that
i
would
buy
again

what
i

nothing
about

you
so
i
guess
in
that
sense
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
pretty
solid
but
it
just
seems
too
light
in
appearance
and
in
body
for
me
to
give
it
higher
marks
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
more
but
there
were
just
a
few
too
many
off
aspects
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried

very
smooth

very

the
style
suggests
d
all

i
could
want
from
an
oatmeal

the
head
is
foamy
and
very
long
lasting
the
smell
is
weakbut
you
can
detect
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
has
alot
of
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
flavor
the
texture
is
very
creamy
and
delicious
the
mf
is
medium
and
well
balanced
this
is
another
good
brew
from
otter
creek
and
ill
buy
this
again
i
really
like
this
one
makes
an
impact
and
imparts
deliciousness
cant
beat
that
drinkability
im
not
a
coffee
connoiseur
so
i
didnt
find
this
to
be
as
drinkable
as
many
other
stouts
i
didnt
find
the
tastes
to
be
disgusting
or
off
however
its
just
that
im
not
big
on
coffee
and
i
do
think
the
coffee
taste
predominates
if
you
like
coffee
youll
probably
find
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
though
i
certainly
wouldnt
consider
this
to
be
a
session
stout
a
la
guinness
prety
drinkable
it
just
falls
a
bit
short
musings
i
am
an
oatmeal
guy
this
one
is
very
good
easily
drinkable
but
retaining
its
own
uniqueness
i
wouldnt
put
it
over
its
vt
cousin
mcneills
but
its
definitely
a
contender
a
great
version
of
the
style
robust
flavors
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
perfect
for
a
bold
take
on
the
style
my
favorite
otter
creekwolavers
offering
to
date
overall
a
nice
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
verdict
enjoyable
flavors
but
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
this
would
be
a
top
oatmeal
stout
if
the
mouthfeel
werent
so
hollow
maybe
worth
a
try
out
of
curiousity
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
very
memorable
this
is
my
first
time
trying
oatmeal
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brownwith
a
slight
redish
hue
tan
headand
good
lace
smelled
like
a
dunkel
weizen
mouthfeel
was
light
and
flat
taste
was
of
oats
and
malt
it
was
lighter
than
i
expectedand
had
a
burnt
edge
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
more
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
but
an
okay
stab
nonetheless
i
thought
the
body
was
a
little
thin
and
the
hopmalt
balance
favored
the
hops
a
bit
too
much
still
enjoyable
just
not
one
ill
long
for
m
d
mouthfeel
is
very
good
goes
down
smooth
wolavers
has
done
it
again
hats
off
to
otter
creek
and
upstate
vermont
pours
black
no
brown
hues
no
light
nothing
just
a
pitch
dark
black
thin
head
aroma
of
sweet
rich
dark
strong
coffee
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
exceptional
sweet
raosted
malts
strong
coffee
taste
balanced
by
some
hop
character
and
spices
it
has
a
nice
velvety
mouthfeel
feels
viscous
and
thick
in
the
mouth
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
brew
because
it
is
very
filling
that
aside
it
is
very
drinkable
because
its
so
damn
tasty
if
this
is
wolavers
first
dark
beer
i
request
many
many
more
the
flavor
is
roasty
with
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
taste
it
has
all
of
the
stout
flavor
without
a
hugely
bitter
finish
it
leaves
a
mild
burnt
taste
in
the
mouth
for
a
little
while
after
swallowing
all
in
all
really
nice
and
smooth
if
a
bit
thinner
than
the
taste
would
suggest
i
noticed
that
the
pale
ale
had
a
similar
level
of
carbonation
ill
be
getting
this
again
this
is
a
nice
sipper
playful
yet
easy
going
if
there
ever
was
a
stout
for
warmer
months
this
is
it
my
1st
impression
with
the
taste
is
the
burnt
quality
i
noticed
in
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
little
of
their
stovepipeporter
in
that
regard
becomes
less
astringent
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
no
hints
of
sweetness
typical
of
oatmeal
stouts
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
as
well
for
this
type
of
stout
my
personal
favorites
of
the
style
are
anderson
valley
barney
flats
due
to
its
robustness
and
samuel
smiths
for
its
flavor
but
this
one
falls
flat
compared
to
those
still
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
to
set
it
apart
tbh
im
surprised
its
a
4
0
beer
as
it
pretty
much
comes
up
a
little
short
in
most
aspects
ok
but
there
are
plenty
of
others
in
this
category
i
prefer
just
being
organic
is
not
enough
incentive
for
me
to
seek
this
out
this
is
my
first
reveiw
so
be
patient
bar
none
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
drank
and
i
have
drank
a
lot
of
beer
limited
only
untill
recently
by
ncs
6
cap
as
soon
as
this
beer
hits
your
mouth
the
roasted
oatmeal
comes
alive
pauses
for
another
swig
wow
there
is
nothing
but
the
sheer
grace
of
a
higher
power
coming
from
this
bottle
if
you
have
never
treated
yourself
to
a
wolavers
please
do
so
when
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
have
this
beer
in
my
refrigerator
the
fridge
smiles
back
at
me
too
bad
i
have
to
drive
an
hour
each
way
just
to
get
this
beer
but
if
that
is
what
it
takes
will
drink
again
sometime
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
stout
flavor
without
the
sometimes
hefty
feel
not
bad
bottle
has
a
bottled
on
date
and
a
batch
number
this
beer
pours
what
appears
to
be
a
deep
brown
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
tints
of
red
glow
through
a
minimal
head
forms
and
disappears
but
laces
the
glass
well
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
roasted
goodness
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
hints
of
chocolate
and
just
roasted
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
but
nice
it
still
seems
a
little
light
on
the
palate
but
this
is
a
good
beer
after
a
few
of
these
i
would
feel
quite
filled
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
reddish
notes
tannish
head
was
impressive
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
pf
toasted
malt
coffee
and
caramel
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
fishished
with
a
bitter
malt
flavor
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
last
winter
bottled
about
3
months
ago
and
still
delicious
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
oats
chocolate
molasses
and
a
hing
of
fig
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
big
chocolate
coffee
molasses
and
oats
flavor
with
a
dark
fruit
and
cream
in
the
background
mouthfeel
really
is
velvety
smooth
like
it
says
on
the
label
with
light
carbonation
but
a
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
that
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
well
drinkability
is
descent
but
its
pretty
filling
as
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
overall
a
great
tasting
brew
taht
i
enjoyed
totally
do
not
let
a
lesser
feel
rating
scare
you
from
this
one
very
tasty
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
around
the
edges
and
a
slight
tan
head
that
quickly
fell
fresh
gound
coffee
toasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
to
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
coffee
excellent
toasted
malt
flavors
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
creamy
and
not
too
thick
very
drinkable
brew
if
i
do
say
so
myself
this
one
is
a
definite
winner
a
little
chewy
and
oily
at
the
end
with
some
tight
carbonation
good
beer
i
could
have
two
or
three
at
a
time
then
move
on
to
something
a
bit
lighter
tasted
041405
my
only
complaint
is
a
rough
burnt
grain
aspect
on
the
finish
hop
bittering
is
subdued
but
the
burnt
bitter
aftertaste
is
all
from
the
grains
i
think
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
despite
my
initial
misgivings
based
on
the
appearance
i
was
happily
surprised
that
this
organic
offering
had
such
a
full
flavor

makes
me
wonder
what
the
nonorganic
stouts
are
doing
so
wrong
on
more
than
a
few
occasions
this
poured
a
dissapointing
head
it
is
dark
brown
in
color
and
somewhat
opaque
smell
is
primarily
coffee
grounds
now
the
tasting
now
we
are
getting
somewhere
the
taste
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
nice
hop
finish
to
cap
a
great
taste
mouthfeel
is
blissfully
creamy
and
smooth
has
a
somewhat
high
abv
for
the
style
but
it
is
not
too
much
which
makes
this
beer
an
extremely
drinkable
one
unfortunately
i
do
not
have
any
more
guess
ill
have
to
find
otter
creek
when
da
boss
and
i
are
in
vermont
in
october
12
oz
screwcap
bottle
thanks
to
sulldaddy
poured
a
fingerandahalf
lightbrown
or
tan
head
over
a
pitch
black
liquid
smelled
of
freshly
roasted
coffee
beans
with
a
noticalbe
backdrop
of
chocolate
like
the
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
my
mother
sometimes
buys
very
rich
roasted
coffee
beans
tasted
chocolate
to
start
with
some
sweet
then
a
rich
sweet
rolling
in
with
a
coffee
and
a
silky
smooth
body
oh
boy
this
is
enjoyable
the
end
is
a
bit
roasty
dry
with
a
very
faint
floral
hop
rising
up
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
particular
hop
perhaps
fuggles
i
wish
there
were
more
to
this
beer
other
than
chocolate
and
coffee
but
thats
about
all
i
get
mostly
coffee
true
there
of
several
different
kinds
of
coffee
that
roll
around
but
no
other
flavors
arise
to
take
me
on
interesting
rides
very
enjoyable
and
very
rich
and
potent
in
flavor
mdthick
body
with
mild
carbonation
fantastic
lacing
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
with
a
film
of
head
still
hanging
over
the
top
of
the
liquid
has
a
very
nice
lactose
sweetness
throughout
that
likely
comes
from
the
silky
smooth
oatmeal
used
to
make
this
beer
this
beer
poured
up
dark
and
almost
root
beer
in
color
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
the
taste
is
sweet
but
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
little
this
after
tasate
simply
makes
you
want
another
sip
very
successful
for
an
organic
brew
tree
huggers
will
love
this
one
id
definetly
recommend
it
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
thick
and
creamy
body
is
medium
and
finish
is
balanced
between
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
nip
of
floral
hops
so
good
i
had
a
second
one
this
is
a
descent
oatmeal
stout
it
pours
a
somewhat
translucent
dark
brown
almost
black
the
head
is
rather
minimal
in
size
and
does
not
last
long
the
smell
is
good
of
nice
malts
the
taste
is
an
odd
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
being
unfortunately
nothing
special
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
good
while
this
is
a
beer
certainly
worth
trying
there
are
far
better
ones
out
there
to
enjoy
halfinch
brown
head
dense
and
regular
on
an
opaque
dark
purple
color
the
smell
gives
a
great
impression
of
smoothness
with
a
deep
chocolaty
character
dry
roaste
coffee
and
a
controlled
fruity
potential
quite
milky
too
the
taste
is
quite
interesting
and
enjoyable
too
a
heavy
malty
chocolaty
character
with
also
pronounced
notes
of
roasted
coffee
light
biting
notes
of
citrus
lemon
a
raspberry
feeling
hops
appear
and
stay
on
the
tongue
with
the
mixed
bitterness
of
the
dry
cocoa
note
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
it
feels
heavy
at
times
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
not
as
velvety
as
one
could
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
but
pretty
enjoyable
not
the
best
or
most
complex
stout
ive
had
but
certainly
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
light
brown
head
over

deep

with

mouthfeel

flavors
of
bitter

roasty
maltiness
more
coffee
and
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
finishes
hoppy
and
bittersweet
a
superb
oatmeal
stout
among
the
best
out
there
very
drinkable
by
the
fire
with
some
nuts
or
cheese
oh
hell
it
tasted
good
watching
the
daily
show
next
to
the
radiator
wishing
i
was
in
front
of
a
fireplace
i
like
this
beer
and
recommend
anyone
trying
it
it
is
not
one
of
those
full
bodied
stouts
that
i
reallly
like
but
the
aroma
and
taste
make
it
a
good
beer
12
oz

pours
into
the
imperial
pint
glass
a
dark
ruby
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
almost
no
lacing
and
reduces
to
nothing
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
and
coffee
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
beer
has
a
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
and
tastes
like
coffee
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
it
has
a
medium
body
leaves
a
slightly
warming
sensation
and
has
a
soda
fizziness
almost
you
can
hear
the
bubbles
in
the
head
popping
after
swirling
the
glass
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
not
the
best
ive
tried
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
and
given
the
choice
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
its
not
a
homerun
but
it
is
certianly
not
a
dud
either
received
this
in
my
final
shipment
of
the
beer
of
the
month
club
stamped
1505
and
has
been
sitting
at
the
shipment
place
for
over
two
weeks
so
at
least
they
get
their
beer
out
quickly
no
lacing
head
or
real
carbonation
found
in
the
poured
pint
glass
very
rich
overpowering
smell
of
roasted
oats
coffee
and
chocolate
too
hoppyroasted
oats
a
bit
much
as
this
warmed
up
other
scents
and
flavors
more
apparent
this
raised
my
taste
review
5
points
have
not
been
a
fan
yet
of
wolavers
organic
brews
but
it
is
better
than
the
middleberry
ale
drinkability
because
its
not
too
heavy
its
drinkablility
is
very
high
for
the
style
however
its
overpowering
aftertaste
makes
it
hard
to
want
a
second
pint
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
red
highlights
small
and
weak
tan
head
which
leaves
a
thin
film
and
pretty
good
lace
nice
strong
chocolate
and
coffee
malt
aromas
tastes
of
roasted
bitter
coffee
malts
on
a
creamy
and
sweet
oat
background
very
nice
lasting
burnt
toast
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
full
in
the
mouth
with
fairly
strong
and
prickly
carbonation
not
easydrinking
since
its
rich
and
fullbodied
but
a
dark
robust
and
tasty
beer
nevertheless
final
thought
an
extremely
impressive
oatmeal
stout
made
from
the
states
might
be
the
best
one
here
12
ouncer
with
bottled
on
dating
of
101804
nice
its
been
in
the
bottle
for
only
about
10
weeks
yeah
fresh
beer
pours
darkest
of
browns
dark
tan
minimal
head
almost
all
lacing
slides
down
the
glass
nose
is
big
and
burnt
malty
taste
is
dominated
here
by
notes
of
roasted
grain
mocha
chocolate
and
fresh
roasted
coffee
beans
smooth
and
tasty
but
with
an
outmeal
stout
im
always
looking
for
that
oilysmooth
mouthfeel
dont
really
get
it
here
its
more
dry
and
chalky
flavorful
stout
worth
a
try
and
good
to
support
the
organic
farmers
of
the
world
it
isnt
overwhelming
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
another
pour
very
drinkable
had
this
brew
the
other
night
over
at
mahars
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
saw
it
on
tap
so
had
to
give
it
a
try
and
may
i
say
i
was
not
disappointed
this
brew
was
poured
to
a
nice
deep
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
off
brown
head
that
had
great
retention
and
lacing
the
brew
smells
heavily
of
roasted
malt
with
strong
hints
of
coffee
molasses
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
roasted
malt
flavors
and
also
has
a
nice
bite
of
hops
that
seems
to
enhance
the
heavier
flavors
the
brew
is
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
perfect
for
the
colder
weather
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
you
will
not
be
disappointed
pours
almost
black
head
was
small
but
lacing
was
good
smell
is
a
blend
of
roasted
malt
and
light
oaty
combination
taste
is
very
deep
on
malt
with
a
beautiful
dry
finish
that
ends
in
a
nice
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
excellent
dry
somewhat
chewy
a
nice
blend
very
easy
on
the
driinkability
scale
could
definitely
have
another
good
choice
for
stout
lovers
served
a
deep
deep
darkskish
brown
almost
blacky
with
a
tan
headskie
that
just
will
not
quit
roasty
and
sweet
black
malty
goodness
in
every
sip
the
bitterr
hop
flavors
also
come
through
quite
nice
great
flavor
is
in
every
sip
this
is
without
question
the
best
wolavers
brew
yet
im
so
glad
to
see
this
on
tap
clear
plastic
pint
cup
presentation
nice
tan
12
brown
head
over
a
dark
brown
opaque
brew
aroma
is
deeply
of
dark
grains
taste
is
dominated
by
dark
malts
as
well
but
not
overpowered
by
coffee
bitterness
rather
balanced
with
sweet
chocolate
flavors
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
great
the
creaminess
makes
it
all
come
together
ng
it
was
a
little
thin
but
quite
drinkable
once
the
initial
surprise
over
the
taste
was
gotten
over
notes
good
stout
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
thin
but
this
may
actually
help
its
long
term
drinkability
would
be
good
paired
with
desert
pours
almost
a
deep
ruby
more
than
black
when
held
up
to
the
light
this
a
very
thin
headaroma
of
malted
milk
and
bitter
chocolate
also
a
small
does
of
nuttiness
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
with
some
milk
choclate
thrown
in
and
a
nice
earthynutty
finish
not
to
sweet
i
get
an
almost
caramel
corn
aftertaste
to
this
brew
wich
is
very
appetizing
and
different
alot
of
flavor
here
from
chocolate
to
earth
to
that
caramel
corn
a
real
nice
nightcap
for
me
here
smooth
beyond
belief
with
flavors
of
intense
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
finish
is
slightly
bitter
as
is
coffee
but
the
parting
flavor
is
that
of
cream
with
a
coffee
tinge
an
excellent
beer
that
is
reminiscent
of
coffee
enjoy
dark
brown
if
not
black
in
hue
when
held
to
a
light
ruby
highlights
shine
around
the
edges
a
foamy
brown
head
reached
a
maximum
height
of
one
finger
and
then
it
quickly
faded
to
a
bubbly
cap
the
subsequent
lacing
was
almost
none
the
nose
is
quite
pleasant
there
is
great
roasted
depth
with
aromas
of
chocolate
hints
of
milk
oats
charred
wood
not
smoky
earth
and
coffee
all
of
these
smells
work
in
perfect
harmony
this
is
close
to
perfection
the
bouquet
is
terrific
there
is
reasonable
potency
and
the
invitation
is
quite
clear
the
palate
is
almost
as
pleasant
as
the
nose
the
alcohol
warmth
seems
out
of
place
to
me
the
heat
is
offputting
just
a
bit
there
are
excellent
roasted
flavors
earthy
charred
wood
with
astringent
acidity
that
melts
into
one
with
the
chocolate
flavors
the
coffee
stands
alone
as
does
the
herbal
hoppines
the
oats
do
an
excellent
job
of
rounding
out
the
flavors
nothing
becomes
too
extensive
or
too
aggressive
the
flavors
are
straightforward
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
until
the
aftertaste
which
seems
flawed
because
it
tastes
like
rubbing
alcohol
it
isnt
very
strong
but
it
is
still
gross
i
managed
to
get
around
this
well
enough
and
id
still
consider
the
palate
to
be
very
lovely
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thin
for
me
it
lacks
in
bulk
and
the
fact
there
is
very
low
carbonation
doesnt
help
this
aspect
of
that
beer
much
the
consistency
is
a
bit
creamy
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
the
recipe
seems
very
old
school
like
centuries
old
im
digging
that
this
was
quite
good
imo
this
is
a
hard
style
to
get
right
this
one
was
close
thanks
unionmade
fullsmooth
body
this
brew
is
a
very
dark
brown
color
not
quite
opaque
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
medium
thin
and
quickly
dissipating
light
tan
head
and
very
thin
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
roasted
coffee
and
soy
dry
and
a
little
too
thinbodied
for
my
tastes
with
flavors
of
coffee
caramel
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
some
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
finish
along
with
a
touch
of
hops
this
stout
falls
short
in
about
every
area
but
despite
that
it
is
still
drinkable
i
managed
to
find
this
in
cincinnati
at
the
dilly
deli
and
have
since
bought
all
they
had
the
appearance
is
a
beautiful
dark
mahogony
with
a
good
head
that
left
traces
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
toasty
malted
oat
aroma
that
immediately
jumpstarted
my
taste
buds
i
was
prepared
for
that
nice
toasted
malted
oatmeal
stout
experience
but
found
a
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
that
masked
what
i
was
longing
for
still
it
was
a
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
not
to
heavy
not
to
burnt
i
would
have
happily
sacrificed
drinkability
for
a
little
more
sweetness
though
not
a
bad
beer
still
like
youngs
better
drinkability

this
was
a
nice
overall
oatmeal
stout
that
didnt
wimp
out
at
the
end
like
a
lot
of
others
that
ive
had
well
done
wolavers
pours
black
with
a
brown
head
and
very
malty
nose
the
first
taste
gives
off
very
malty
oaty
body
with
a
slight
sweetness
this
has
to
be
the
most
oatmeally
stout
i
have
ever
had
it
is
almost
chewy
and
goes
great
with
cookies
i
can
taste
the
quality
of
wolavers
brewing
and
maybe
the
organic
ingredients
add
to
the
flavour
you
cant
drink
too
many
of
these
but
this
is
a
nice
pint
pint
glass
at
the
bass
lake
draft
house
in
holly
springs
nc
char
more
great
espresso
strong
up
front
some
nice
chocolate
the
roast
flavours
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
right
from
the
begining
a
tingle
of
citrusy
hops
is
left
on
the
tongue
velvety
smooth
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
if
there
is
anything
these
guys
do
well
its
thier
porter
and
stout
this
is
great
it
pours
a
nice
black
colour
with
a
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
barley
with
a
bit
of
a
coffee
hint
the
taste
was
a
smooth
coffee
taste
it
was
complimented
by
a
slight
cocoa
and
earthy
thing
that
was
going
on
rather
nice
complex
for
a
stout
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
the
variety
of
aromas
and
flavors
that
i
so
sorely
desire
the
watered
down
feeling
this
has
doesnt
help
it
out
either
an
okay
stout
but
nothing
great
reminds
me
of
goose
island
oatmeal
stout
actually
but
a
bit
better
drinkablity
smooth
for
an
oat
stout
pretty
tasty
overall
a
fine
brew
overall
i
reccommend
it
but
not
in
the
face
of
the
upperechelon
oatmeal
stouts
flavor
is
nice
oats
and
chocolate
sweetness
up
front
a
nice
coating
of
the
tongue
as
i
swallow
then
it
finishes
very
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavor
this
transisition
is
actually
a
few
seconds
after
swallowing
and
not
immediate
what
a
nice
ride
of
flavors
in
my
mouth
a
well
crafted
brew
that
i
will
purchase
again
nice
dark
brew
with
tan
foamy
head
lots
of
carbonation
rising
good
wholesome
roasted
malt
oats
slight
hint
of
coffee
tastes
like
it
should
roasted
malt
sweet
oats
slightly
bitter
chocolate
coffee
mix
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
this
was
a
recommendation
from
the
beer
store
guy
on
something
that
would
wow
me
said
it
was
as
good
as
my
samuel
smiths
not
quite
but
still
a
good
stout
off
white
head
that
stayed
around
for
half
the
glass
no
lace
to
speak
of
its
not
until
the
beer
has
left
my
mouth
and
started
its
way
down
my
throught
that
notice
the
flavor
coffee
with
a
hint
of
carmel
there
might
just
be
some
hops
in
there
too
feels
kind
of
awkward
in
the
mouth
ive
come
to
expect
alot
more
from
an
oatmeal
stout
beef
notes
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
in
small
doses
because
all
you
really
need
to
do
is
drink
a
little
and
youll
have
the
basic
effect
of
the
beer
for
an
hour
or
two
im
talking
about
the
lingering
coffee
aftertaste
which
i
love
this
also
means
that
i
like
really
like
the
beer
but
only
when
im
not
drinking
it
man
this
beer
confuses
me
ill
have
to
try
it
again
sometime
just
to
make
heads
or
tails
of
it
still
pretty
dang
good
regardless
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
is
a
roasted
nutty
and
chocolatey
scent
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
quite
a
dark
malt
palate
to
it
it
has
chocolate
and
black
barley
flavor
it
has
a
dry
bite
but
it
finishes
smooth
and
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
drinks
well
this
is
a
fine
stout
another
quality
brew
from
wolavers
otter
creek
thanks
to
pbrian
for
this
one
pours
dark
and
deep
black
color
i
cant
see
through
the
glass
when
held
up
to
a
light
decent
creamy
light

that
leaves
good
lacing
in
my
glass

a
chocolate
and

aroma
dark
roasted

flavors
medium

that
has
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
bitter
and
sweet
chocolate
flavors
in
the
finish
well
done
despite
the
oatmeal
the
beer
retains
a
coarse
backwoods
feeling
the
overall
impression
somehow
conjures
up
an
image
of
some
grizzled
old
woodsman
decked
out
in
a
coonskin
hat
and
furs
hes
from
back
in
1700s
ye

and
a

the

running
over
one

from

survived
back

to
a
lesser
degree
oats
throughout
the
tastechocolate
and
a
rich
tarry
overtone
very
oily
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
moderate
and
the
oatmeal
creaminess
carries
it
through

creamy

thick

bitter
a
little
bland
enjoyed
it
a
bbq
place
in
boston
i
had
to
do
it
give
it
a
try
who
knows
if
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
could
change
my
mind
or
not
if
nothing
else
to
reaffirm
that
nitro
is
such
a
waist
of
good
beer
maybe
there
is
an
actual
oatmeal
stout
lingering
somewhere
i
cant
tell
however
cause
there
is
no
character
at
all
drank
this
ontap
at
the
source
in
grand
rapids
mi
pours
dark
nearly
black
in
color
small

its
a
smooth
easydrinking
tasty
beer
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
im
at
founders
brewery
but
i
dont
think
ive
ever
bought
this
in
bottled
form
beautiful
stout
but
i
had
issues
getting
a
decent
head
when
pouring
i
like
this
beer
smooth
feel
good
flavour
all
right
oatmeal
stout
or
brown
ale
a
session
stout
if
you
will
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
tasty
but
it
doesnt
expect
as
much
complexity
as
other
of
their
dark
beers
though
some
is
likely
masked
by
the
nitro
o
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
though
the
lower
abv
makes
for
less
danger
and
more
enjoyment
2
pints
could
have
easily
become
3
or
4
with
more
time
and
less
to
do
in
the
morning
poured
into
a

going

even
for

always
comes
off
thin
to
me
despite
the
silkinessand
low
carbonation
overall
i
would
take
this
over
guinness
but
its
just
not
my
style
whats
the
point
id
just
rather
drink
water
and
save
the
liver
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
stout
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
t
coffee
roasty
oats
surprisingly
sessionable
great
beer
figured
id
grab
a
quick
pint
at
this
new
tap
house
and
i
realized
ive
never
had
this
particular
founders
brew
before
done
it
pours
a
straight
murky
onyx
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
bean
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
the
vanilla
is
replaced
by
a
bit
of
treacle
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
nice
nitrogenation
and
a
subsequently
velvety
feel
overall
a
nice
bythenumbers
oatmeal
stout
not
bad
at
all
011214
on
tap
a
solid
solid
brew
its
all
in
this
glass
body
flavor
aroma
smoothness
and
above
all
satisfaction
if
youre
looking
for
anything
else
start
in
the
mirror
because
you
need
to
find
out
who
you
are
this
concoction
has
no
doubts
overall
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
the
nitro
makes
it
smooth
it
was
who
we
thought
it
was
i
had
this
on
a
nitro
pour
and
really
enjoyed
watching
it
settle
it
is
black
in
color
but
a
bit
of
light
will
seep
through
when
held
up
to
light
an
inch
thick
creamy
khaki
colored
head
caps
it
off
i
smell
flaked
oats
and
dark
malt
the
taste
is
more
about
subtlety
and
i
get
dark
malt
and
flaked
oats
theres
a
reserved
bitterness
from
the
dark
malt
the
texture
is
creamy
and
smooth
great
beer
a
premier
oatmeal
stout
that
i
will
have
to
look
for
overall
very
easy
drinking
beer
ltd
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
the
nitro
was
great
for
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
am
lucky
enough
to
be
from
grand
rapids
so
it
is
very
easy
for
me
to
access
this
beer
because
of
being
a
nitro
tap
it
is
hard
to
find
other
places
it
appears
to
be
a
very
dark
beer
but
because
of
the
nitro
it
is
very
light
and
smooth
with
a
very
rich
taste
and
and
a
slight
taste
of
oatmeal
its
definitely
a
good
winter
beer
o
tasty
oatmeal
stout
enjoyable
to
drink
slightly
heavy
could
easily
be
a
go
to
for
accompanying
a
steak
or
burger
the
lower
4
5
abv
makes
this
an
easily
drinkable
beer
that
accompanies
food
or
good
conversation
o
nice
lunch
session
beer
with
mild
flavors
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easy
on
nitro
tap
at
2
bros
pours
a
dark
brownish
black
color
with
over
an
inch
of
thick
brown
head
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
chocolate
coffee
and
earth
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
roasty
and
lightly
smokey
with
dark
chocolate
light
hints
of
sweet
vanilla
and
oatmeal
slight
dark
chocolate
bitterness
but
its
a
sweet
beer
overall
caramel
and
toasted
malts
at
the
finish
has
that
nice
velvety
and
creamy
mouthfeel
you
expect
from
nitro
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
on
nitro
and
would
like
to
have
a
chance
to
try
the
regular
version
worth
looking
for
o
rather
tasty
really
i
believe
ill
have
another
pours
thick
black
nice
cascade
from
the
nitro
clean
solid
head
with
great
lacing
wet
mouthfeel
good
oatmeal
and

3
5
out
of
5
good
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
flavorful
on
nitro
tap
at
proof
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
forever
amazing
lacing
im
more
than
halfway
through
the
pint
and
theres
still
half
an
inch
of
creamy
foam
aroma
is
light
coffee
some
light
sugar
sweetness
taste
is
slightly
vanilla
i
doubt
theres
actual
lactose
in
this
beer
but
i
get
some
milky
sugars
mouthfeel
is
next
level
shit
velvety
little
bubbles
all
over
my
tongue
i
can
dig
this
overall
a
pretty
good
nitro
take
on
a
light
oatmeal
stout
good
creamy
chocolate
notes
with
some
balancing
hops
towards
the
finish
never
had
this
one
before
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
nice
nitropour
obsidian
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
sank
to
about
a
quarter
inch
and
held
there
lacing
the
glass
as
i
sipped
pretty
basic
aroma
roasty
dark
malts
toasted
oatmeal
basically
the
same
in
the
taste
dark
malts
toasted
oats
unsweetened
chocolate
giving
a
light
bitterness
a
good
brew
even
if
theres
nothing
here
you
havent
had
before
medium
body
smooth
mouthfeel
thanks
to
mr
nitrogen
a
pretty
basic
brew
but
still
good
doesnt
really
stack
up
to
founders
other
stouts
but
its
a
solid
base
beer
tastes
more
like
a
beefy
brown
ale
than
a
stout
but
thats
ok
nice
flavors
but
are
pretty
weak
good
sessionable
stout
o
im
kind
of
a
sucker
for
nitro
taps
this
was
really
nice
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
flavor
you
could
definitely
pound
down
a
few
pints
of
this
given
the
4
5
abv
id
go
for
this
one
again
nice
oatmeal
stout
that
i
will
definitely
get
again
if
i
see
it
on
draft
overall
a
fine
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
stout
drinker
to
at
least
try
i
was
disappointed
to
not
have
experienced
more
of
the
oats
factor
of
the
oatmeal
stout
that
may
have
just
been
me
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
a
large
frothy
head
the
aroma
has
strong
oat
flavors
and
chocolate
notes
the
taste
has
a
nice
water
flavor
with
hints
of
oats
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
very
watery
and
fizzy
overall
it
has
nice
flavors
but
its
too
light
and
watery
tastefeel
chocolate
roast
coffee
definitely
a
lighter
beer
as
the
feel
is
thin
yet
creamy
is
that
possible
apparently
so
it
just
has
a
light
flavor
that
lets
you
know
its
a
low
abv
but
it
still
packs
a
nice
little
punch
excellent
for
what
it
is
this
stuff
ought
to
be
bottled
or
something
because
this
would
be
a
damn
fine
sessionable
stout
any
oatmeal
stout
on
nitro
gets
me
off
but
this
one
is
better
than
most
being
from
founders
the
king
of
great
stout
in
all
variations
clean
looking
shiny
obsidian
black
in
color
with
a
fat
inch
of
lacey
off
white
head
it
smells
bitter
for
the
style
less
smooth
and
sweet
more
thin
and
sharp
odd
maybe
the
roast
is
a
little
heavy
or
something
but
it
lacks
the
cohesive
creaminess
of
others
in
smell
the
flavor
delivers
though
with
a
slick
feeling
rich
semisweet
stout
that
finishes
with
bakers
chocolate
and
bitter
burnt
barley
its
a
glorious
experience
so
smooth
in
feel
and
really
light
for
its
color
gentle
beer
with
a
great
nitro
feel
without
too
much
body
long
lasting
bitterness
on
the
finish
defines
this
one
for
me
a
little
different
than
most
as
there
must
not
be
too
much
oatmeal
in
this
or
it
would
be
sweeter
and
fuller
bodied
or
higher
alcohol
i
dont
know
love
the
sessionable
nature
of
this
with
its
lower
abv
was
this
ever
bottled
i
dont
recall
seeing
it
but
its
one
heck
of
a
good
beer
on
the
nitro
tap
perfect
for
winter
but
i
could
get
into
this
year
round
oits
a
good
easy
drinking
stout
from
founders
you
might
not
expect
more
from
a
typical
oatmeal
stout
but
youd
definitely
expect
more
from
a
typical
founders
beer
its
not
even
something
i
can
recommend
to
anyone
it
made
for
an
enjoyable
afternoon
drink
though
black
with
a
ridiculously
thick
creamy
and
dense
brown
head
this
looks
great
the
nose
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
chocolate
cream
oatmeal
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
palate
opens
with
a
pleasant
roasted
malt
bitterness
dark
chocolate
cream
and
a
little
honey
oatmeal
creaminess
and
earthiness
come
thru
on
the
mid
palate
with
a
mellow
fruitiness
the
nitro
pour
makes
this
super
slick
on
the
palate
with
the
oatmeal
only
enhancing
it
drying
chocolatey
and
fruity
on
the
finish
this
is
very
enjoyable
recommended
the
feel
is
very
smooth
a
touch
viscous
and
watery
but
creamy
this
is
a
very
interesting
installment
from
founders
good
but
simple
and
not
served
as
well
by
the
nitro
tap
the
beers
truetoform
oatmeal
stout
is
supple
and
strong
much
like
those
from
17th
century
london
but
its
nitrogen
creates
a
heafty
appearance
and
fuller
initial
taste
and
texture
but
it
dulls
the
aromas
and
leaves
its
finish
weak
its
a
giveandtake
on
all
accounts
smooth
taste
with
some
mild
roast
nutty
and
earthy
with
a
slight
bitterness
creamy
texture
mellow
feel
with
a
fairly
light
body
something
seems
missing
but
its
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
lacks
a
little
depth
but
it
tastes
good
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
it
was
enjoyable
but
i
would
like
to
try
this
without
nitro
just
to
compare
thanks
again
don
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
smooth
with
the
nitro
tap
the
beer
feeling
simultaneously
feeling
smooth
thick
and
flowing
due
to
the
nitro
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
on
the
palate
o
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
very
tasty
as
well
as
well
balanced
a
good
brew
from
founders
who
never
really
lets
us
down
black
with
a
thick
permanent
nitro
head
on
the
surface
tons
of
lacing
mild
aromas
of
oats
buttery
toffee
and
general
roastiness
with
a
subtle
hoppy
hit
towards
the
end
malty
toasty
lightly
sweet
and
nutty
flavors
a
little
bittersweet
chocolate
smooth
and
light
this
one
goes
down
about
as
easy
as
water
pretty
good
though
nitro
is
still
almost
always
a
negative
in
my
book
serving
type
nitrotap
i
realize
that
oatmeal
stouts
can
cover
a
wide
spectrum
between
sweet
and
bitter
i
think
this
may
be
the
first
one
ive
had
that
sits
this
far
on
the
dry
earthy
part
of
the
scale
its
not
as
dry
as
an
irishstyle
stout
but
its
certainly
no
milk
stout
or
sweet
stout
a
very
interesting
interpretation
but
i
think
i
prefer
a
little
more
sweetness
on
the
palate
even
at
the
expense
of
some
of
the
silkiness
on
the
feel
bottom
line
creamy
brew
with
the
nitro
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
oatmeal
stout
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
nothing
amazing
but
an
extremely
easy
drinking
stout
the
body
is
a
tad
too
light
but
other
than
that
very
good
o
overall
this
was
good
beer
though
i
enjoyed
founders
other
stouts
more
than
this
one
but
its
a
stand
up
brew
recommended
by
me
a
little
to
roasted
for
me
but
good
none
the
less
odecent
oatmeal
stout
has
great
feel
but
lacks
a
little
in
complexity
of
flavors
o
an
easy
drinking
smooth
and
tasty
oatmeal
stout
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
its
look
and
the
general
roastiness
through
both
the
nose
and
the
flavoring
for
an
oatmeal
stout
the
aroma
stayed
way
roasty
sweet
and
happily
smoky
for
the
style
while
the
flavoring
showed
robustness
but
did
cheapen
a
bit
along
with
the
feel
as
the
beer
warmed
the
feel
did
begin
soft
and
silky
but
as
the
tasting
went
on
it
lost
that
bright
effervescence
and
became
a
bit
watery
otherwise
it
is
nicely
contributory
and
actually
bolsters
the
creaminess
and
milk
chocolates
of
the
taste
this
is
a
tasty
offering
and
pleasant
on
nitro
but
be
sure
to
drink
it
on
the
cooler
side
for
that
full
effect
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
o
decent
but
wont
seek
it
out
kudos
for
lots
of
flavor
for
low
abv
t
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
this
beer
its
an
easy
drinker
after
a
night
of
heavier
founders
beers
or
something
you
can
drink
without
getting
a
buzz
on
4
5
abv
for
some
reason
i
cant
find
anything
exceptional
about
this
beer
it
has
its
moments
and
it
is
sure
to
please
for
those
looking
for
a
simple
brew
overall
not
bad
but
look
for
other
nitro
offerings
when
you
go
to
brewery
m
great
mouthfeel
as
it
was
full
and
creamy
with
nice
mouth
coating
and
lasting
aftertaste
overall
lots
of
flavor
for
the
low
abv
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
which
at
times
can
be
underpowered
for
flavor
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
combined
with
low
abv
make
it
quite
sessionable
very
enjoyable
with
a
light
flavor
and
one
to
have
again
if
i
come
across
it
i
was
feeling
a
little
under
the
weather
when
i
tried
this
beer
im
big
on
founders
beers
and
their
specialty
stouts
are
among
my
favorites
maybe
i
had
high
expectations
when
i
finally
made
the
trip
up
to
grand
rapids
but
that
hasnt
stopped
me
from
being
impressed
by
good
beer
at
other
brewerys
that
being
said
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
pretty
yet
bland
beer
it
had
everything
going
for
it
but
it
tasted
like
a
stout
for
the
masses
and
the
feel
i
got
from
the
crowed
and
some
other
brewery
only
offerings
was
that
they
were
trying
to
appeal
to
the
masses
not
a
lot
of
flavor
im
sure
anyone
whos
favorite
beer
is
guinness
draught
would
think
its
great
but
id
take
a
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
any
day
over
this
overall
this
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
i
have
drank
it
many
times
visiting
the
founder
taproom
and
i
always
look
forward
to
it
being
at
the
taproom
if
you
love
oatmeal
stouts
you
better
try
this
founders
please
bottle
this
beer
so
as
i
go
in
and
take
a
closer
look
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
be
honest
this
really
did
not
smell
much
like
an
oatmeal
stout
at
least
to
me
it
was
much
more
reminiscent
of
a
baltic
porter
well
at
first
it
did
it
had
that
sharp
alcohol
nose
to
it
and
a
hint
of
some
dark
spicy
fruit
mixed
in
quite
interesting
and
definitely
more
then
a
little
unique
i
decided
to
let
it
warm
to
really
bring
out
what
was
hiding
in
here
and
then
came
out
the
nice
sweet
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
along
with
hints
of
lactose
that
i
was
looking
for
the
flavors
followed
along
with
a
hint
again
something
sweet
but
yet
a
tart
sort
of
fruit
flavor
as
well
very
nice
very
rich
full
body
on
this
one
with
great
carbonation
that
never
really
gave
up
any
ground
at
all
o
very
drinkable
could
easily
stick
with
this
brew
all
night
would
make
a
great
year
round
offering
as
a
more
introductory
brew
but
still
somewhat
satisfying
for
the
more
seasoned
beer
advocate
d
a
superb
stout
easy
drinking
low
alcohol
stout
could
certainly
enjoy
a
few
in
a
sitting
but
it
would
be
easy
to
become
bored
a
very
solid
beer
overall
but
it
just
a
bit
boring
fairly
drinkable
but
not
enough
to
rank
with
the
best
i
am
looking
for
a
little
more
flavor
pours
near
black
with
a
fairlythick
tan
head
with
pretty
good
retention
though
nothing
exceptional
for
a
nitro
beer
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
a
good
amount
of
roast
plus
some
chocolate
and
a
slight
amount
of
coffee
the
toast
is
dry
and
quite
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
there
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
roasted
and
dry
medium
body
drinks
quite
well
and
is
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
though
nothing
really
stands
out
here
reviewed
on
6272010
on
nitro
tap
at
founders
pours
black
with
a
thick
nitro
head
aroma
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
an
odd
skunklike
aroma
odd
in
a
tap
beer
but
it
was
there
flavor
of
sweet
roasted
malt
plus
the
odd
skunk
less
apparent
but
still
there
it
was
very
bland
tasting
not
bad
just
bland
i
was
disappointed
as
i
had
expected
better
from
founders
but
this
is
not
one
of
their
winners
man
this
is
tasty
stuff
served
with
a
fine
foamy
creamy
light
brown
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
an
opaque
brown
black
aroma
is
roast
toast
cocoa
malt
taste
is
like
nose
and
has
a
great
bittersweet
balance
off
set
with
a
little
carbonic
tang
that
works
perfectly
body
is
great
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
fairly
long
session
beer
for
slower
drinking
note
this
was
not
nitro
dsuper
rich
and
delicious
plus
a
low
abv
make
this
very
drinkable
on
tap
at
founders
poured
into
a
pilsner
type
glass
pours
a
deep
brown
non
see
through
color
with
a
pillowy
tight
bubbled
head
this
on
nitro
sure
fing
is
im
told
looks
very
guinnessy
roasted
malt
type
aroma
with
a
nutty
type
notes
very
creamy
mouthfeel
light
coffee
aftertaste
with
the
some
sweetness
very
creamy
good
lace
d
i
have
always
loved
this
brew
but
its
so
hard
to
order
it
among
all
of
the
other
more
glamorous
offerings
at
the
taproom
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
stout
and
is
definitely
worth
a
chance
d
this
is
something
you
order
a
keg
of
has
everything
great
about
a
stout
and
has
the
drinkability
of
a
great
session
beer
fantastic
flavor
balance
and
drinkability
just
solid
stuff
my
only
complaint
is
where
is
the
oatmeal
this
just
reminds
me
of
an
irish
dry
stout
to
me
d
fair
the
style
does
not
lend
itself
to
be
particularly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
great
beer
but
the
style
is
not
terribly
drinkable

cheers
overall
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
unfortunately
it
is
a
beer
that
should
be
ordered
for
dessert
and
i
ordered
it
to
start
off
with
i
strongly
suggest
having
this
one
to
end
a
meal
and
not
to
start
one
as
i
did
i
think
this
is
an
outstanding
stout
it
pours
a
fantastic
brown
head
that
is
very
thick
dense
and
creamy
this
body
of
the
beer
is
black
it
is
so
smooth
coffee
chocolate
creamy
i
really
love
this
beer
the
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
or
over
the
top
all
the
edges
are

smooth
overall
great
beer
and
at
five
percent
you
can
afford
to
tip
back
a
few
unbelievably
smooth
rich
and
creamy
dark
chocolate
prevails
with
a
vanilla
oatmeal
twist
bold
statements
of
strong
coffee
very
delicious
and
refreshing
and
drinkable
as
hell
this
one
is
a
winner
pours
a
midnight
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
a
little
sweet
with
burnt
characteristics
taste
is
similar
but
amazingly
smooth
i
have
never
had
a
beer
this
smooth
the
only
thing
close
was
murphys
stout
but
this
is
up
a
notch
the
taste
was
great
as
well
as
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
like
velvet
across
the
palette
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
could
drink
these
at
any
time
a
very
versatile
beer
go
to
founders
and
pick
one
of
these
up
delicious
overall
a
good
break
beer
if
one
is
sampling
a
few
things
its
one
of
the
lower
abv
beers
at
founders
and
despite
that
has
a
very
solid
if
not
overly
distinct
flavour
this
was
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
and
enjoy
again
at

you
can
drink
a
few
and
really
appreciate
this
fine
beer
hopefully
with
some
fine
friends
my
first
nitrotap
obviously
it
took
awhile
for
the
head
to
dissipate
but
eventually
i
got
a
dark
beer
with
a
creamy
tan
head
i
really
couldnt
get
much
from
the
aroma
because
of
the
nitro
i
think
the
taste
was
very
roasted
roasted
oatmeal
roasted
coffee
and
more
roasted
grains
i
think
i
tasted
rye
this
beer
had
a
definite
bitterness
to
it
which
i
think
is
from
the
grains
not
a
hoppy
bitterness
however
there
was
an
acidity
in
the
finish
that
i
couldve
done
without
a
really
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
without
the
nitro
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
atleast
once
on
nitrotap
this
is
very
good
stuff
another
exceptional
brew
from
founders
im
really
confused
here
theres
no
way
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
right
theres
no
oatmeal
flavor
or
defining
sweetness
and
the
body
is
very
very
thin
the
head
was
gorgeous
and
the
retention
and
lacing
are
on
point
but
flavorwise
its
just
so
dry
and
thin
that
my
mind
is
boggled
as
to
how
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
never
would
have
guessed
it
really
is
too
carbonated
though
i
always
keep
a
couple
of
these
on
the
shelf
at
home
because
it
is
such
a
reliably
great
beer
and
only
7
dollars
a
bomber
at
hazels
in
boulder
whenever
i
am
not
in
the
mood
to
try
something
new
this
one
always
get
a
good
look
great
balance
of
stout
flavor
with
the
breakfast
accents
a
decent
beer
just
nothing
special
going
on
in
any
aspect
found
the
nose
weak
and
certainly
not
as
creamy
as
id
expect
from
an
oatmeal
more
hop
than
malt
here
not
a
lot
of
exciting
things
happening
here
pretty
standard
stout
that
is
basically
just
toasted
malt
with
a
light
hop
back
a
little
storebought
coffee
chocolate
in
there
as
well
certainly
good
but
fairly
run
of
the
mill
creamy
tasty
ive
had
this
on
tap
several
times
and
it
has
always
been
a
delightmuch
more
mellow
and
refined
than
what
im
tasting
from
the
bottle
this
bottle
was
pretty
ordinary
save
for
the
excessive
carbonation
so
a
rehack
on
my
first
review
of
this
beer
a
very
good
stout
creamy
like
it
should
be
a
good
hint
of
hops
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
that
lingers
good
nose
excellent
stout
not
sure
what
was
wrong
on
my
first
try
12
oz
bottle
into
snifter
not
sure
of
bottles
age
but
considering
the
layer
of
yeast
caked
to
the
bottom
id
say
it
was
sitting
for
at
least
half
a
year
pours
pretty
dark
for
a
6
stout
looks
black
in
the
glass
with
rusty
brown
along
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
tight
tan
colored
head
roasted
malts
oats
and
maybe
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
is
what
i
get
for
smell
taste
is
mild
the
creaminess
makes
it
enjoyable
but
the
thinness
detracts
from
it
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
but
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
rogues
beers
definitely
not
a
world
class
stout
by
todays
standards
o
great
oat
stout
was
disappointed
with
this
one
rogue
makes
much
better
stouts
purchase
value
c
a
22oz
bottle
of
this
currently
retails
for
7
99
which
means
that
given
the
quality
of
the
beer
the
consumer
is
getting
an
aboveaverage
return
on
their
investment
would
certainly
recommend
getting
a
bottle
to
drink
or
age
overall
imagine
a
maltforward
ipa
and
youve
got
something
a
bit
like
this
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
even
leaving
out
my
somewhat
local
bias
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
leaves
this
eating
dust
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
i
kindof
expected
better
from
a
rogue
beer
and
sadly
i
cant
share
the
enthusiasm
that
others
have
shown
a
great
one
no
doubt
but
still
a
notch
below
the
samuel
smiths
offering
great
tasting
stout
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
awesome
simply
awesome
my
favorite
low
alcohol
stout
overall
a
pretty
disappointing
oatmeal
stout
and
wondering
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
the
beer
overall
smells
feels
and
tastes
like
a
malty
ipa
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
if
theyre
looking
for
a
good
oatmeal
stout
body
medium
to
full
body
with
light
carbonation
a
great
bitterness
creamy
pitch
black
with
a
smallish
tan
head
the
smell
is
sweet
marshmallows
jelly
beans
sugar
cookies
with
a
little
floral
hint
the
taste
doesnt
follow
the
nose
like
i
had
expected
it
its
think
in
the
mouth
the
floral
essence
hits
first
and
then
follows
with
a
dark
roasty
flavor
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
expected
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
considering
how
sweet
the
smell
was
really
good
beer
superb
stout
and
the
best
ive
had
to
date
of
all
the
beers
i
try
just
to
try
this
one
keeps
me
coming
back
as
often
as
possible
super
deep
roasted
flavors
that
hang
around
long
after
the
last
sip
incredible
beer
this
is
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
pours
dark
and
creamy
with
a
mochalike
head
complex
aroma
of
toasted
malt
expresso
and
dark
chocolate
a
profound
taste
combining
rich
toasted
malt
with
a
surprising
infusion
of
almost
citruslike
hops
long
lingering
finish
that
reflects
the
taste
of
the
beer
a
must
try
for
any
stout
lover
consistently
flavorful
throughout
particularly
thanks
to
the
roasted
grains
and
bittercitrusy
hops
just
enough
carbonation
to
be
satisfying
but
little
enough
not
to
interfere
with
the
smoothness
of
the
texture
solid
and
straightforward
one
of
their
best
beer
imo
really
didnt
find
this
stout
to
be
anything
special
no
outstanding
flavors
not
sure
why
its
rated
so
high
tasty
smooth
stout
if
that
makes
since
haha
great
taste
its
creamy
and
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
its
delicious
and
refreshing
when
its
cold
and
it
gets
even
better
as
it
warms
up
a
little
bit
you
can
really
taste
the
riesens
its
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
its
definitely
there
but
not
even
close
to
being
overpoweringly
sweet
this
is
how
a
stout
should
feel
not
too
thick
but
not
watery
a
solid
stout
with
good
carbonation
pairs
well
with
spicy
food
its
good
not
my
style
of
beer
but
i
can
recognize
how
good
this
beer
is
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
decent
head
for
a
stout
dissipates
quickly
almost
no
lacing
heavy
roasted
malt
aromas
with
a
hint
of
sweetfruity
chocolate
all
of
witch
are
prevalent
in
the
taste
also
tasting
hints
of
dark
coffee
medium
light
mouthfeel
but
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
an
incredible
sensation
with
the
richest
smell
and
taste
o
excellent
got
in

some
would
say
an
oatmeal
stout
pairs
with
anything
dare
you
to
try
it
with
thai
stinky
beans
and
shrimp
with
red
curry
paste
then
rethink
it

i
wanted
to
like
this

than
i
did
malty

bitter
my
friend
said
she
picked
up
chocolate
but
i
wasnt
getting
much
of
it
maybe
a

of
cocoa
im
not
getting
the

id
expect
from
this
style

awesome
it
tastes
like
some
kind
of
coffee
soda
unless
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
id
say
avoid
it
theres
nothing
good
about
drinking
an
alcoholic
version
of
black
coffee
and
club
soda
it
is
not
bad
though
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
bear
in
mind
i
am
a
fan
of
dark
beer
and
the
various
styles
from
which
they
originate
from
one
of
favorite
breweries
rogue
from
oregon
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
is
my
standard
for
oatmeal
stout
and
this
is
almost
as
good
rogue
seems
to
alway
knows
how
to
make
sure
the
brew
has
character
this
outmeal
stout
is
smooth
and
at
the
same
time
has
that
kick
that
rogue
loves
to
add
pours
thick
little
lacing
or
head
a
bit
musty
espresso
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
excellent
maybe
great
but
not
perfect
o
4
25
very
impressive
oatmeal
stout
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
go
for
more
rogue
beers
but
for
some
reason
i
dont
i
probably
would
never
visit
this
again
although
its
perfectly
drinkable
there
are
better
stouts
for
the
money
looking
at
sn
stout
heres
where
the
beer
loses
me
its
a
thinner
bodied
and
creamy
beer
i
like
the
creaminess
the
thinness
of
the
beer
coupled
with
the
moderate
to
moderate
high
carbonation
is
too
much
for
me
for
the
style
if
the
beer
had
more
body
and
less
carbonation
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
much
more
all
things
said
this
is
a
good
beer
the
beer
gets
high
praise
i
think
there
are
others
that
should
get
equal
marks
or
higher
glad
i
tried
it
22
oz
bottle
ive
got
to
say
that
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
that
werent
rated
near
as
high
as
this
youngs
oatmeal
was
a
lot
better
thats
why
i
have
to
go
with
a
low
rating
just
wasnt
that
good
too
much
alcohol
up
front
and
not
enough
flavor
motley
out
poured
into
a
fremont
small
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
has
good
retention
and
moderate
lacing
nice
aroma
of
sweet
toasted
malt
chocolate
light
coffee
hint
of
vanilla
flavor
follows
with
toasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
a
drier
mildly
hoppy
finish
with
slight
astringency
medium
bodied
lighter
than
id
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
a
nicely
made
flavorful
stout
that
does
not
quite
have
the
body
and
rich
mouth
feel
ive
experienced
with
most
oatmeal
stouts
stout
flavor
profile
is
near
perfect
with
just
a
little
dryness
in
the
finish
o
i
was
expecting
a
heavier
stout
based
off
of
the
appearance
and
smell
but
it
is
very
smooth
and
nice
deep
black
in
color
not
even
a
hint
of
color
on
the
edges
poured
with
a
dense
creamy
mocha
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
rich
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
grainy
cereal
aromas
with
lightly
charred
malt
and
hops
at
the
end
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
velvety
smooth
feel
and
light
crispness
along
the
edges
at
the
finish
dark
roasted
malt
and
coffee
up
front
followed
by
chocolate
flavors
into
the
middle
hop
bitterness
quickly
overwhelms
the
malty
sweetness
tangy
hop
bite
is
followed
by
intense
pine
and
light
citric
hop
bitterness
to
the
end
finished
semidryly
with
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
notes
followed
by
a
lingering
charred
malt
and
hop
bitterness
complex
aromas
and
flavors
with
a
silky
smooth
feel
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
love
hoppy
stouts
best
from
rogue
o
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
rather
more
bitter
than
some
from
the
almost
70
ibus
but
enjoyable
as
an
american
west
coast
take
on
the
style
the
bitterness
makes
it
seem
like
its
abv
is
higher
than
6
yummy
o
well
done
solid
oatmeal
stout
everything
comes
together
very
well
m
mediumfull
body
silky
and
very
smooth
almost
light
oily
medium
carbonation
finishing
is
bitter
and
dry
o
a
pretty
good
stout
for
a
great
price
6
for
22oz
at
world
market
i
love
the
sweetness
and
creaminess
to
it
o
this
is
an
authentic
stout
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
to
adventure
into
the
world
of
stouts
excellent
consistency
color
taste
and
appearance
o
i
enjoyed
this
stout
i
dont
always
enjoy
oatmeal
stouts
but
this
one
was
an
exception
overall
this
is
a
really
good
oatmeal
stout
i
paired
it
with
baked
lemon
tofu
and
noodle
salad
it
kind
of
screams
out
for
more
robust
food
than
that
but
it
was
a
darn
good
companion
anyway
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
seek
this
out

slightly
tart
with
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
providing
the
base
while
redskin
peanut
lemon
rind
and
chalky
minerals
add
nuance
reminds
me
of
a
thin
to
moderate
bodied
toptier
irish
dry
stout
with
an
extremely
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
the
smoothness
has
to
be
experienced
to
be
believed
a
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
that
has
some
hop
presence
and
is
curiously
devoid
of
prominent
sweetness
screams
american
when
compared
with
excellent
british
examples
like
samuel
smith
and
not
in
a
bad
way
cant
believe
i
havent
rated
this
pours
nearly
black
under

subtle

roast
in
the
flavor
and
some
citrusy

creamy
smooth
not
quite

appropriate
for

i
imagine
i
would
have
rated
this
one
higher
years
ago
but
hey
its
still
a
classic
good
hoppy
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
foamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
oats
and
dark
chocolate
which
comes
off
less
appealing
than
it
sounds
unfortunately
otherwise
the
beer
is
fantastic
has
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
malts
oatmeal
chocolate
and
even
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
taste
goes
down
smooth
and
has
an
excellent

the

a

with
some

and
some

flavor
starts
off
roasty

then
earthy
bittering
hops
but
then
finishes
up
and
extends
into
the
aftertaste
with
some
nice
sugars
from
the
oats
roasty
coffee
and
burnt
char
mixed
with
some
hops
the
finish
is
by
far
the
highlight

this
beer
a

overall
the
beer
that
got

full
chocolate
flavor
and
coffee
awesome
dessert
beer
edited
10
minutes
later
to
add
that
i
starting
picking
up
some
faint
vanilla
flavors
after
the
beer
sat
a
minute
or
two
o
the
oats
add
some
smoothness
and
make
it
an
enjoyable
drink
not
too
heavy
flavor
is
mild
but
pleasant
nice
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
abound
an
solid
example
of
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
dark
well
really
dark
just
like
a
good
stout
should
i
see
a
bit
of
lacing
but
not
much
theres
very
little
smell
could
just
be
me
i
do
detect
sort
of
a
chocolatey
smell
with
some
burnt
parts
hmm
the
taste
is
a
little
different
than
i
was
expecting
im
very
used
to
a
heavy
tastetexture
from
oatmeal
stouts
this
one
however
has
a
smoother
taste
noted
by
an
earthy
body
and
a
sort
of
chocolate
finish
i
knew
there
was
chocolate
somewhere
in
here
a
lot
less
of
the
actual
oatmeal
can
be
tasted
in
this
one
i
like
the
mouthfeel
although
im
not
entirely
sure
it
fits
the
style
i
e
heavy
almost
like
you
ate
a
loaf
of
bread
well
overall
im
actually
a
little
disappointed
i
really
was
expecting
to
get
a
heavier
offering
like
oatis
from
ninakasi
or
the
oatmeal
stout
from
samuel
smiths
my
favorite
to
date
i
still
think
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
as
it
highlights
differences
in
the
style
of
the
oatmeal
stouts
poured
into
a
16
oz
snifter
not
sure
when
ur
was
bottled
why
rogue
why
give
us
a
date
please
pours
so
dark
and
a
incredible
mocha
head
the
most
impressive
looking
regular
stout
i
have
ever
seen
smell
is
chocolate
toffee
roasted
coffee
beans
and
vanilla
taste
is
what
you
expect
from
the
nose
but
this
is
a
complex
6
1
seriously
amazing
this
stout
is
only
a
regular
stout
drinks
like
milk
shake
body
is
very
big
for
its
just
above
average
abv
for
me
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
oatmeal
stouts
wow
so
special
on
tap
even
better
that
is
a
side
note
but
almost
every
beer
is
better
on
tap
o
my
first
rogue
beer
pretty
good
so
far
has
a
very
good
nose
that
is
better
than
the
taste
but
the
taste
is
good
so
no
disappointment
here
oit
is
great
to
finally
try
this
classic
of
craft
beer
for
me
the
reputation
is
mostly
deserved
you
get
solid
flavors
smooth
feel
great
drinkability
and
no
gimmicks
what
is
most
impressive
is
how
smooth
and
drinkable
this
beer
is
without
losing
either
the
oatmeal
character
or
the
more
aggressive
coffeeroasted
malt
flavors
i
enjoyed
the
roguee
chocolate
stout
much
more
mf
medium
bodied
medium
dry
finish
slightly
sharp
finish
from
the
carbonation
not
as
smooth
as
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
medium
bodied
with
a
very
slight
wateriness
around
the
edges
of
the
beer
the
carbonation
is
more
aggressive
than
expected
from
the
appearance
medium
length
for
the
finish
overall
very
good
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
rogue
a
brewery
that
tends
to
disappoint
me
not
this
time
o
a
really
excellent
stout
with
a
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
roastiness
very
nice
mouthfeeel
and
appearance
for
a
stout
overall
an
awesome
oatmeal
stout
from
rogue
and
perhaps
their
best
beer
definitely
a
must
try
beer
for
any
fans
of
stouts
this
beer
is
great
super
dark
pour
with
a
nice
mocha
head
half
finger
for
my
glass
smell
was
a
strong
stout
with
sweet
notes
taste
was
great
good
mouth
feel
with
a
stout
flavour
that
went
down
and
left
your
mouth
with
some
coffee
dark
malts
flavour
and
it
was
great
way
better
than
rogues
chocolate
stout
overall
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
smooth
and
balance
of
flavors
o
tasty
stout
aroma
is
the
highlight
here
for
me
but
solid
overall
o
a
wellaboveaverage
stout
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
expensive
and
very
poor
beer
i
would
avoid
this
at
all
cost
it
is
an
uninspired
and
uninteresting
version
of
the
oatmeal
stout
another
poor
beer
from
rogue
prokofiev
would
be
a
well
composed
music
to
go
with
this
well
brewed
beer
i
prefer
his
film
works
for
eisensteins
battleship
potemkin
the
beer
doesnt
really
have
the
mouthfeel
from
oats
i
wish
there
was
more
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitterness
out
great
oatmeal
stout
been
too
long
between
revisits
recommended
o
nice
beer
im
actually
impressed
with
this
beer
the
flavors
are
nice
it
drinks
well
and
its
not
too
filling
very
drinkable
id
buy
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
it
big
black
and
beautiful
i
dont
drink
too
many
rogue
beers
but
this
oatmeal
stout
packs
a
lot
of
sensory
delights
must
get
more
overall
great
oatmeal
stout
rogue
usually
comes
through
big
time
with
their
stouts
and
porters
and
this
one
does
not
let
down
overall
a
solid
stout
from
rogue
it
has
all
the
traditional
flavors
and
smells
associated
with
other
stouts
however
for
this
reason
it
is
fairly
forgettable
there
are
plenty
of
other
stouts
on
the
market
you
could
get
more
for
a
cheaper
price
and
you
wouldnt
be
missing
out
on
much
from
this
brew
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
only
because
i
know
of
other
stouts
i
prefer
i
like
this
beer
it
is
comparable
with
ninkasis
oatis
for
a
bitter
malty
oat
stout
i
did
not
even
know
it
was
made
with
oatmeal
until
typing
up
my
napkinscribbled
review
it
tastes
like
a
thick
stout
with
harsh
darkroast
coffee
bitterness
the
american
hops
are
incongruous
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
they
should
be
toned
down
and
perhaps
replaced
to
some
extent
with
noble
hops
or
more
caramel
malt
the
color
was
quite
dark
and
the
moderate
head
was
a
beautiful
tan
color
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
after
reading
some
of
the
very
good
reviews
however
this
brew
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
could
not
get
away
from
perhaps
i
got
an
off
bottle
and
will
make
another
try
you
better
come
thirty
for
this
bad
boy
or
its
money
wasted
lets
start
with
the
oversized
behemoth
of
a
1
pint
6oz
bottle
for
around
7
i
cant
drink
that
much
stout
after
work
and
would
love
a
smaller
4
pack
option
the
pour
was
good
with
lots
of
rich
creamy
brown
head
has
a
nice
sweet
fruity
smell
that
puts
my
grinning
face
deep
into
the
glass
my
thoughts
are
easily
lost
in
deeply
roasted
malts
and
tantalizing
bitterness
it
has
everything
that
i
like
in
oatmeal
stout
but
the
cocoa
was
a
bit
overpowering
for
me
in
the
aftertaste
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
nitpicking
the
logical
minds
shakespeare
didnt
know
chocolate
so
maybe
they
should
rename
this
beer
to
imply
what
it
really
is
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
anyways
in
short
there
is
nothing
unexpected
just
a
good
stout
with
lots
of
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
only
negative
is
the
price
and
size
limits
the
purchase
options
from
me
without
a
friend
to
share
it
with
tm
subtle
well
rounded
stout
not
overwhelming
in
any
particular
are
chocolate
coco
flavor
some
mocha
a
good
amount
of
malts
with
some
tones
of
vanilla
very
drinkable
beer
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
full
bodied
could
be
a
little
thicker
in
my
opinion
two
words
warm
harmony
prost
lampertland
roasty
chocolatey
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
not
my
fave
stout
but
fairly
drinkable
nothing
exceptional
but
good
balance
of
chocolate
and
roast
flavors
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
one
is
a
little
too
light
and
bitter
for
my
tastes
the
subtle
metallic
smell
and
taste
kind
of
threw
me
off
im
new
at
paying
attention
to
what
i
taste
so
i
could
be
mistaking
that
sensation
for
something
else
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
special
i
have
had
several
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
pure
dark
brownblack
with
a
very
coarse
tan
head
sea
foam
like
head
does
not
last
very
long
at
all
smell
is
quite
roasted
and
coffee
like
taste
is
dry
and
a
little
bitter
no
real
sweetness
to
speak
of
grain
notes
picked
up
coffee
ground
flavors
body
is
smooth
with
light
carbonation
pretty
decent
stout
with
a
dry
bitterness
o
solid
oatmeal
stout
slightly
roasted
notes
match
well
with
the
smoothness
provided
by
the
oatmeal
nice
chocolaty
linger
b
pours
a
fairly
solid
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
smallish
khaki
head
that
persists
quite
well
smells
of
caramel
and
roast
with
hints
of
cream
vanilla
and
earth
light
bits
of
dark
fruit
aroma
as
well
as
hints
of
light
sugar
round
out
the
nose
quite
well
the
flavor
is
roasty
chocolate
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
chalk
and
earthy
hops
medium
body
with
a
creamy
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
light
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
really
nice
stout
approachable
yet
flavorful
and
creamy
as
hell
overall
a
really
great
stout
that
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
delicious
and
wellbalanced
solid
oatmeal
stout
here
and
actually
one
of
rogues
less
expensive
bomber
offerings
nice
robust
flavors
along
with
a
friendly
mouth
feel
and
a
low
abv
make
this
stout
super
drinkable
any
time
of
the
day
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
large
mocha
head
some
decent
lacing
foam
clings
to
the
glass
smells
chocolately
first
then
roast
character
really
takes
over
as
it
warms
slight
burnt
character
earthiness
aromas
as
well
likely
from
the
hops
tastes
a
tad
acrid
from
the
roast
subtle
chocolate
caramel
light
vanilla
notes
tastes
bitter
but
not
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
again
the
earthiness
comes
into
play
feels
about
medium
to
mediumfull
oats
give
it
a
nice
velvety
creamy
feel
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
for
awhile
would
love
to
try
this
one
super
fresh
when
the
hops
are
more
fresh
and
in
your
face
didnt
see
a
bottled
on
date
o
overall
this
is
a
fine
and
very
tasty
stout
i
love
how
the
oats
coffee
and
hops
blend
with
each
other
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
this
is
great
as
far
as
enjoying
a
stout
goes
and
only
my
second
beer
tried
from
rogue
the
other
being
their
chocolate
stout
i
recall
more
sweetness
with
their
latter
and
thats
a
quality
i
prefer
in
stouts
but
all
in
all
surely
try
this
if
you
havent
i
would
again
for
sure
o
a
great
oatmeal
stout
with
wonderfully
subtle
flavors
goes
down
so
creamy
and
smooth
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
nice
froth
smells
exactly
like
most
stoutsmalted
with
some
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
honey
a
little
yeast
as
well
taste
is
very
roasty
with
dark
chocolate
flavor
throughout
there
is
a
hopped
zing
in
the
finish
which
is
subtle
but
evident
good
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
an
irish
coffee
froth
colored
head
aromas
of
chocolate
and
coffee
bean
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
not
unappealing
just
not
complimentary
of
the
flavor
nothing
like
a
good
creamy
viscous
fluid
to
deliver
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
so
nicely
a
lot
of
chocolate
flavor
is
noted
with
some
underlying
coffee
coffee
bitterness
lingers
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
id
been
really
excited
about
trying
this
one
but
im
disappointed
o
orgasm
in
my
mouth
probably
the
best
offering
from
rogue
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
theres
that
problem
of
the
house
yeast
nice
depth
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
o
its
not
that
this
stout
does
anything
special
as
much
as
this
stout
does
everything
well
a
great
oatmeal
stout
creamy
and
smooth
as
youd
expect
with
understated
roast
malt
flavors
o
very
good
not
quite
as
finetasting
as
a
founders
porter
but
leaning
in
that
charred
direction
not
as
rich
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
as
a
founders
breakfast
stout
and
no
coffee
in
this
one
nevertheless
its
a
very
good
tasting
lowish
abv
stout
that
i
enjoyed
one
of
the
best
nonimperial
stouts
out
there
unfortunately
bottles
in
the
22
oz
format
and
more
expensive
than
it
should
be
very
well
done
smooth
and
full
of
rich
roasted
tastes
this
is
when
drink
beer
for
the
sake
of
just
having
a
beer
is
so
worthy
o
an
awesome
example
of
the
style
this
has
everything
i
want
in
an
oatmeal
stout
smooth
as
silk
wellbalanced
roast
and
chocolate
serving
type
22oz
bomber
o
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
that
is
about
as
balanced
as
can
be
not
quite
as
good
as
sam
smiths
in
my
book
however
this
is
a
nice
easy
to
drink
stout
the
nitro
tap
adds
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
creamier
taste
the
roasted
malts
and
traditional
stout
flavors
are
on
point
and
balanced
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
pint
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
thick
brown
head
smell
of
dark
roasted
malts
predominantly
taste
is
like
a
strong
cup
of
french
roast
coffee
that
level
of
roasty
bitter
flavor
surprisingly
bitter
and
wellbalanced
by
the
hops
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
feel
too
just
what
i
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
good
stuff
o
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
delicious
raw
oat
flavor
counter
balanced
with
rich
roasty
cocoa
and
just
enough
brightness
from
the
hops
this
is
a
wellrounded
wellbalanced
oatmeal
stout
it
certainly
doesnt
break
any
ground
and
its
probably
not
going
to
blow
anyones
mind
but
it
stays
very
true
to
the
style
its
a
great
example
of
what
all
oatmeal
stouts
should
be
and
its
one
of
the
most
solid
offerings
ive
had
from
rogue
overall
good
solid
beer
but
not
rogue
worthy
and
defiantly
not
90
great
winter
drinking
beer
o
i
find
the
flavors
and
aromas
of
this
beer
though
the
bitterness
does
make
it
a
little
tough
to
drink
very
enjoyable
and
one
i
would
have
again
but
this
is
not
a
sessionable
beer
between
the
bitterness
and
the
dryness
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
the
full
and
roundness
of
a
great
or
even
good
beer
just
werent
there
decent
and
palatable
o
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
not
earth
shattering
but
pleasant
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
the
style
good
roasted
flavors
o
im
wondering
if
i
served
this
too
warm
but
then
i
realized
i
had
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
at
a
similar
temperature
and
was
far
superior
to
this
in
just
about
every
manner
id
definitely
try
it
again
just
to
confirm
whether
or
not
my
fears
are
true
all
in
all
its
far
from
bad
just
disappointing
medium
bodied
light
effervescence
slightly
watery
aspect
drying
to
a
slight
extent
needs
more
body
and
some
sweetness
this
isnt
a
good
a
beer
as
i
had
hoped
especially
with
the
high
rating
it
got
oh
well
one
mans
poison
a
good
beer
but
not
great
imo
in
fact
nearly
every
beer
lower
than
this
56
today
on
the
beers
of
fame
list
i
prefer
over
this
one
served
in
a
pint
glass
at
the
pdx
airport
via
nitro
line
beautifully
pours
creamy
black
with
two
fingers
head
aroma
not
too
apparent
as
it
was
served
in
a
pint
but
hints
of
a
malty
essence
and
oatmeal
of
course
drinks
thick
and
creamy
and
very
delicious
although
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
balanced
and
extremely
satisfying
especially
waiting
for
a
flight
departure
highly
recommend
stopping
by
the
rogue
taproom
at
pdx
and
a
friendly
bartender
cheers
overall
this
was
one
fine
tasty
beer
the
nitro
pour
suited
all
the
darker
roasted
flavors
very
well
giving
an
overall
creamy
and
satisfying
brew
o
this
is
a
pretty
quintessential
oatmeal
stout
with
a
creamy
fairly
thick
body
and
good
roasty
flavor
expect
light
coffee
and
cocoa
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
try
it
if
available
but
dont
kill
yourself
looking
for
it
note
i
had
mild
sinus
congestion
when
i
wrote
this
so
some
categories
might
be
a
bit
off
d
a
solid
stout
from
a
solid
brewery
i
know
rogue
is
a
bit
of
an
afterthought
for
many
american
bas
but
theyre
basically
the
only
american
craft
brewery
that
ships
a
wide
catalogue
of
beer
up
to
western
canada
and
im
thankful
for
that
while
this
doesnt
pack
the
punch
that
a
lot
of
bigger
imperial
stouts
do
its
still
a
dark
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
even
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
it
is
kind
of
like
a
nitro
pour
with
the
big
creamy
foam
its
just
so
bitter
and
strongly
severely
flavored
from
the
22
oz
bottle
which
cost
7
in
san
diego
this
is
a
really
good
stout
im
starting
to
wonder
if
i
had
a
nitropour
now
because
of
texture
i
didnt
see
the
tap
myself
so
i
dont
know
but
this
is
everything
id
want
from
an
irish
style
stout
with
the
added
bonus
of
oatmeal
malts
and
great
flavor
to
boot
something
that
sometimes
falters
in
lower
abv
stouts
i
would
have
this
again
and
again
overall
this
is
only
like
my
favorite
beer
ever
when
im
drinking
a
shakespeare
i
dont
have
a
care
in
the
world
sensual
qualities
sexy
smooth
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
superb
in
every
category
easily
sessionable
at
6
1
abv
smooth
silky
tastes
great
everything
about
it
is
quality
while
i
have
had
rogue
beers
before
this
is
my
first
review
of
one
and
i
hope
to
convey
this
beers
outstanding
qualities
as
best
i
can
i
dont
know
if
i
can
make
the
call
between
this
and
samuel
smiths
the
only
reason
i
may
call
it
for
samuel
is
strictly
price
where
i
am
smiths
is
4
a
pint
rogue
is
8
otherwise
those
two
beers
are
neck
and
neck
highly
recommended
expecially
with
some
ghiradelli
or
godiva
chocolate
bomber
while
having
some
dinner
at
the
black
pearl
in
ann
arbor
pours
thick
black
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
some
coffee
and
mostly
roasted
barley
and
other
grains
thinner
than
expected
on
the
palate
but
still
pretty
hearty
flavors
of
toasted
coffee
dirt
bitter
chocolate
very
nice
beer
overall
o
rogue
does
it
again
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
and
always
a
treat
to
bad
its
hard
for
me
to
find
happy
to
find
this
at
pies
pints
in
middlebury
ct
this
stout
shows
a
solid
black
color
with
a
big
neverdie
chocolatey
colored
head
with
lots
of
luscious
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
very
subtle
chocolategrain
but
hard
to
place
the
flavor
brings
charcoaldark
chocolate
and
grass
hops
charcoalmalt
emerges
as
the
dominant
theme
but
its
very
nicely
blended
into
a
highly
drinkable
yet
tasty
brew
this
is
creamy
smooth
and
velvetty
in
feel
really
wonderful
and
inviting
body
is
solidly
medium
with
a
bit
of
a
dryresinous
feel
very
nice
and
a
stout
i
would
easily
have
any
time
o
mild
like
youd
expect
but
with
just
enough
subtle
character
to
rescue
it
from
being
bland
and
put
it
into
the
nicely
done
category
id
call
it
a
mature
oatmeal
stout
like
what
they
tried
to
do
with
the
arch
deluxe
its
hard
for
this
style
to
score
highly
due
to
its
innately
mild
and
subdued
character
but
this
is
pretty
well
done
i
put
this
up
there
with
samuel
smiths
overall
nothing
earthshattering
for
sure
pretty
simple
overall
but
ohsopleasant
and
drinkable
you
could
session
this
all
day
and
have
fun
overall
this
was
good
very
drinkable
finishes
chewy
and
slightly
bitter
but
still
very
balanced
overall
crazy
drinkable
and
delicious
the
beer
has
a
fantastic
balance
and
the
appearance
in
the
glass
is
near
perfect
another
solid
brew
from
rogue
that
deserves
its
high
reviews
drinkable
but
i
dont
see
what
all
the
hypes
about
overall
the
more
i
drink
the
lower
the
score
gets
unfortunately
the
carbonation
is
offputting
to
me
still
a
great
beer
though
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
it
again
i
love
the
fullbodied
taste
and
the
sweetness
that
undercuts
the
bitterness
its
not
enough
to
cut
it
entirely
and
it
does
sit
on
the
palate
and
bite
afterward
but
really
this
is
strong
rich
and
smooth
the
chocolatey
coffee
notes
are
there
and
thus
make
this
beer
definitely
a
new
favorite
of
mine
had
this
on
nitrotap
pours
incredibly
smooth
and
took
quite
a
while
for
the
head
to
settle
the
smell
is
very
light
hints
of
oatmeal
and
malt
the
oatmeal
gives
the
taste
a
sweetness
which
we
really
enjoy
you
can
taste
the
oatmeal
malts
and
overall
roasted
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
smooth
and
so
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
was
extremely
enjoyable
and
very
well
done
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
opaque
black
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
nose
lacked
rich
creamy
chocolate
and
oatmeal
that
i
expected
picked
up
more
coffee
and
some
green
herb
notes
instead
the
taste
is
of
more
chocolate
going
into
a
burnt
cocoa
or
even
liquorice
or
charcoal
the
palate
medium
bodied
there
is
a
creamy
texture
in
the
middle
section
and
a
dry
unfortunately
slightly
astringent
finish
expected
more
out
of
this
one
bc
of
its
high
rating
not
going
to
be
on
the
bandwagon
on
this
one
sorry
wonderful
beer
i
think
im
out
of
my
beer
slump
great
taste
nice
on
the
tongue
a
beer
worth
drinking
a
beer
worth
looking
for
nothing
else
to
say
you
neither
like
it
or
you
dont
drink
and
enjoy
nothing
more
to
say
it
black
always
good
a
mighty
fine
beer
thats
doesnt
disappoint
o
overall
this
was
a
decent
stout
but
not
one
that
really
stood
out
for
me
the
sum
of
all
the
aromas
and
flavors
just
didnt
seem
to
come
together
quite
right
for
my
palate
that
said
the
look
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
were
great
and
im
hoping
the
next
rogue
beer
i
try
will
bring
some
redemption
extreme
stout
with
lots
of
body
malt
and
roastiness
almost
no
residual
sweetness
perceivable
o
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
beer
all
the
aspects
work
in
harmony
you
devilish
rogue
ales
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
disappointing
for
a
stout
made
by
rogue
certainly
served
too
cold
and
deserving
of
a
retasting
i
know
you
feel
my
pain
oreally
good
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
when
i
bought
it
i
highly
reccomend
this
one
overall
maybe
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
just
a
fantastic
beer
to
have
with
a
desert
or
even
as
a
desert
by
itself
the
wide
availability
of
this
beer
makes
it
even
better
an
absolute
must
have
in
the
stout
category
if
you
havent
had
this
grab
it
the
next
time
you
go
to
the
store
o
excellent
oatmeal
stout
one
that
i
will
seek
out
more
often
funny
how
rogue
gets
hated
on
all
the
time
on
ba
yet
brews
like
this
get
very
good
reviews
one
things
for
sure
this
beers
is
a
looker
its
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
large
mocha
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
down
the
mug
the
aroma
is
pretty
stouty
with
plenty
of
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
grainy
oat
the
taste
mostly
follows
this
with
a
nice
amount
of
roasted
malts
dominating
the
show
with
some
roasty
coffee
and
grainy
oat
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
id
like
which
seems
to
be
par
for
the
course
for
rogues
stouts
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
though
overall
its
a
solid
stout
that
i
think
would
be
wellsuited
for
sixpacks
let
it
hit
warm
up
a
bit
it
really
helps
bring
out
its
flavor
very
easy
drinking
overall
an
amazing
beer
rogue
isnt
lying
with
the
label
on
the
bottle
stating
world
stout
champion
overall
a
pretty
darn
solid
oatmeal
stout
though
my
first
go
to
would
be
anderson
valley
barney
flats
oatmeal
stout
i
havent
been
disappointed
by
any
beer
made
by
rogue
poured
black
with
a
starkly
opposing
creamy
tan
head
gotta
love
nitro
aroma
was
as
expected
dark
roasted
malts
toasted
grains
notes
of
coffee
and
cocoa
with
promises
of
earthy
hops
taste
followed
the
aroma
dark
malts
and
grainy
oatmeal
roast
and
toast
cocoa
some
coffee
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
smooth
though
not
as
fullbodied
as
expected
from
a
oatmeal
stout
on
nitro
about
mediumbodied
i
suppose
but
still
smooth
and
easily
downable
o
this
is
an
outstanding
oatmeal
stout
wonderful
head
perfect
roasted
flavor
and
so
creamy
i
wish
the
nose
was
a
bit
more
interesting
overall
i
liked
this
better
than
the
breckenridge
suuuper
smooth
oatness
and
someone
would
probably
try
to
convince
me
the
nitro
contributes
to
this
too
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
around
starting
off
the
new
year
with
a
rogue
breakfast
having
this
and
the
hazelnut
after
hearing
lots
of
good
things
about
this
one
i
feel
let
down
a
bit
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
of
mocha
colored
head
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
as
the
drink
disappears
smell
and
taste
are
both
the
same
with
faint
hints
of
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
the
oats
seem
to
be
the
last
thing
you
experience
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
like
the
oats
to
play
a
more
prominent
roll
has
a
medium
body
with
ok
carbonation
and
a
bad
bitter
finish
wish
it
was
thick
and
chewy
so
i
could
enjoy
the
oats
this
is
just
an
ok
oatmeal
stout
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
pours
dark
dark
browm
almost
black
cascading
from
the
nitro
tap
with
a
memorable
creamy
head
smells
rich
and
dark
malty
with
notes
of
unsweetened
cocoa
and
coffee
taste
is
a
little
bit
bitter
at
the
end
but
not
a
hop
bitterness
as
i
know
it
to
be
more
like
bittersweet
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
so
creamy
and
smooth
full
bodied
and
as
drinkable
as
any
stout
in
the
game
a
wonderful
noontime
drink
after
a
hard
night
of
drinking
rejuvenating
and
delightful
overall
pretty
good
but
wish
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
milder
this
beer
is
pretty
great
big
roast
notes
in
this
oatmeal
stout
it
is
ridiculously
drinkable
and
this
bomber
is
disappearing
before
my
eyes
there
are
big
notes
of
roast
and
coffee
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
this
stout
should
always
been
in
any
stout
lovers
refrigerator
dammitall
rogues
have
gone
from
blah
to
outright
bad
on
this
one
this
beer
is
borderline
lousy
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
last
time
i
reviewed
a
rogue
beer
i
swear
i
was
taking
a
rogue
hiatus
apparently
the
hiatus
ended
but
that
goes
double
this
time
note
this
is
the
exact
same
beer
as
the
chocolate
stout
the
only
difference
is
with
that
one
rogue
uses
a
high
grade
expensive
belgian
chocolate
d
very
smooth
and
tasty
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
its
got
several
flavors
that
come
through
and
its
a
good
session
beer
that
is
if
you
want
to
pay
the
6
per
bomber
22oz
bottle
pours
black
as
night
with
a
mocha
head
aroma
of
chocolates
coffee
and
some
alcohol
in
the
taste
more
of
the
aforementioned
chocolate
vanilla
roasted
malts
coffee
char
espresso
and
very
little
booze
or
alcohol
the
oats
have
made
this
beer
silky
smooth
and
goes
down
very
nicely
and
easily
this
bottle
had
some
age
on
it
and
was
still
very
nice
overall
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
with
good
flavors
that
went
well
together
would
be
a
fine
dessert
beer
to
pair
with
chocolate
o
another
overrated
and
overpriced
beer
by
rogue
i
expected
more
given
the
price
tag
and
i
prefer
anderson
valleys
barney
flats
oatmeal
stout
a
lot
more
to
this
one
o
overall
a
very
solid
brew
i
personally
like
the
chocolate
taste
of
stouts
so
this
one
was
really
good
like
i
said
earlier
i
never
got
the
oats
but
still
very
good
do
a
smooth
drinking
stout
lots
of
character
way
beyond
the
oats
and
pretty
drinkable
my
only
complaint
is
the
lackluster
mouthfeel
everything
else
is
great
i
give
a
schlitz
for
this
stout
which
is
fitting
enough
given
that
both
beers
have
the
same
mouthfeel
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
not
sure
it
is
one
of
the
best
however
food
pairing
i
made
beer
braised
chicken
with
this
and
it
was
really
good
o
this
is
an
excellent
showing
of
how
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
nice
and
heavy
with
good
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
it
is
certainly
one
i
will
be
adding
to
my
regular
list
recommend
any
beer
lover
to
at
least
try
it
once
is
it
world
class
not
quite
but
it
is
very
very
good
o
impressive
an
oatmeal
stout
done
right
this
is
a
beer
i
go
back
to
again
and
again
because
of
its
varied
flavours
and
excellent
body
try
it
ogreat
complexity
of
rich
flavors
would
definitely
recommend
cant
think
of
many
ways
to
make
this
better
i
was
able
to
try
the
rogue
shakespeare
stout
at
moe
joes
in
dtown
plainfield
il
the
beer
poured
dark
and
opaque
and
very
little
head
formed
on
the
first
pour
in
addition
the
beer
did
not
lace
on
the
second
pour
there
was
a
bit
more
head
and
some
lace
the
smell
was
roast
espresso
the
taste
was
pretty
much
roast
and
coffee
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
of
the
acidic
coffee
flavor
came
out
the
mouthfeel
was
good
fuller
bodied
stout
which
i
like
and
not
overly
crazy
with
the
alcohol
overall
the
beer
was
decent
d
i
remember
this
being
better
in
my
early
craft
beer
days
but
i
have
a
few
complaints
here
just
not
as
smooth
and
creamy
oat
flavor
on
the
palate
as
well
as
a
carbonation
that
detracts
from
some
of
the
lighter
nuances
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
certainly
a
fan
of
many
things
rogue
but
not
loving
this
overall
i
really
thought
this
was
a
well
made
stout
there
are
few
missteps
that
stop
this
beer
from
being
really
great
like
the
hops
in
the
drink
and
the
mouth
feel
do
yourself
a
favor
and
let
this
one
warm
up
considerably
that
is
where
it
really
shines
this
beer
is
slicky
and
oily
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
head
retention
is
pretty
weak
this
beer
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
but
pretty
easy
to
put
down
tar
black
with
tight
creamy
brown
head
that
falls
to
a
fingers
thickness
black
coffee
and
dark
cocoa
fight
it
out
with
slightly
resinous
cascades
with
warming
softer
milk
chocolate
emerges
along
with
some
grapefruit
rind
the
slightly
oily
and
creamy
mouthfeel
rounds
out
a
fantastic
allaround
stout
o
this
beer
is
absolutely
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
very
rich
verdict
a
really
nice
stout
from
rogue
warm
and
toasty
goes
down
easily
great
for
those
chilly
nights
or
cool
afternoons
overall
ive
not
had
too
many
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
can
honestly
say
its
hard
for
me
to
think
of
a
more
drinkable
wellbalanced
and
just
plain
enjoyable
stout
cheers
to
anyone
who
has
or
is
thinking
about
trying
this
great
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
2
inch
puffy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
thick
foamy
rings
and
spots
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
oats
roasted
coffee
beans
and
some
bittersweet
chocolate
aromas
taste
is
of
the
toasted
oats
and
roasted
coffee
grounds
up
front
with
a
cocoa
powder
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
an
assertive
roasted
coffeecocoa
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
thin
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
with
some
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
to
balance
things
out
a
bit
too
thin
in
my
opinion
o
decent
beer
glad
i
gave
it
a
whirl
but
not

it
updrinkability
is
ok
i
was
considering
giving
up
on
the
style
so
i
stocked
my
fridge
via
my
beer
fridge
with
my
stout
stock
and
thought
that
i
would
trudge
through
a
style
that
had
lost
its
luster
for
me
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
hope
i
can
find
some
more
opinion
changers
in
my
own
fridge
poured
from
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
pours
pitch
black
with
good
tan
head
that
strays
around
a
very
alluring
nose
with
lots
of
malt
xoffee
chocolate
taste
is
very
good
with
lots
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
a
good
hop
balance
another
very
good
beer
from
a
very
consistently
great
brewery
o
a
good
oatmeal
stout
full
bodied
and
rich
with
flavor
appears
to
be
adequate
carbonation
and
wellbalanced
head
seems
to
stay
nicely
with
the
glass
will
have
again
this
beer
is
probably
one
of
rogues
best
beers
i
was
happy
to
have
finally
gotten
some
one
day
at
a
local
wegmans
when
i
was
there
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
pretty
thick
body
surprising
for
rogue
to
have
something
like
this
from
what
ive
had
from
them
in
the
past
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
big
roasted
malty
and
chocolaty
the
taste
follows
the
same
path
its
got
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
indeed
pretty
thick
im
very
happy
that
this
beer
actually
has
some
good
body
to
it
overall
i
think
this
was
really
nice
overall
sweet
roasty
malts
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
smoothest
dark
malt
aftertaste
ive
ever
experienced
o
kind
of
disappointing
mehish
stout
i
would
have
again
but
if
this
glass
is
any
indication
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
a
solid
offering
very
reliable
but
nothing
extraordinary
ive
had
it
before
and
im
sure
ill
drink
it
again
overall
4
5
excellent
stout
smooth
warming
and
at
the
same
time
refreshing
this
beer
set
the
bar
high
for
itself
what
with
all
the
awards
won
listed
all
over
the
bottle
but
it
certainly
lived
up
to
the
hype
worth
tracking
down
and
worth
the
5
pricetag
per
650
ml
bottle
that
pacman
yeast
should
be
proud
of
itself
overall
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
for
sure
i
enjoyed
this
one
for
sure
it
was
super
fresh
as
well
fairly
good
but
not
nearly
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
tried
from
the
22
oz
bomber
sampled
on
august
25
2011
it
pours
a
rich
cherrybrown
to
black
with
a
silky
gentle
tan
head
that
dissolves
to
a
ring
but
not
completely
the
aromas
are
an
enticing
mix
of
chocolate
oatmeal
and
northwestern
hops
the
body
surprised
me
as
it
came
in
a
little
lighter
than
medium
weight
the
taste
had
a
nice
mellow
chocolate
malt
character
with
a
dashing
dose
of
hops
to
carry
it
to
the
end
great
aroma
great
taste
but
a
weaker
body
than
i
anticipated
the
only
detraction
is
the
nitro
i
bet
it
would
be
better
on
straight
co2
overall
this
is
a
mistress
in
a
bottle
this
beer
went
into
my
all
time
top
ten
list
as
soon
as
i
tried
it
and
is
hands
down
the
best
stout
i
have
had
take
your
time
with
this
one
dont
be
the
perverted
uncle
though
that
was
kind
of
creepy
o
rogue
has
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
here
i
havent
had
many
but
as
a
stout
lover
this
will
be
something
ill
enjoy
over
and
over
again
everything
seemed
to
fit
in
just
right
and
all
the
notes
seems
to
be
spot
on
in
a
manner
thats
world
class
i
could
honestly
drink
this
brew
anytime
of
day
its
very
satisfying
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
and
its
easy
to
see
why
its
a
goldmedal
winner
its
been
wellcrafted
lavished
with
pounds
and
pounds
of
ingredients
and
brewed
to
perfection
by
someone
who
truly
loves
stouts
o
nothing
amazing
but
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
style
glad
i
tried
it
but
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
overall
a
great
beer
with
dinner
and
i
think
this
would
be
fantastic
with
a
wide
range
of
desserts
the
flavors
would
compliment
a
variety
of
highly
sweet
desserts
but
serve
as
a
nice
counter
due
to
the
higher
bitterness
level
in
this
beer
an
enjoyable
stout
all
on
its
own
but
far
better
with
food
o
this
is
just
one
of
those
thoroughly
enjoyable
beers
very
easy
to
drink
and
well
made
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
keg
of
this
stuff
overall
great
example
of
one
of
my
fav
styles
this
bomber
went
way
too
quickly
maybe
this
bottle
is
a
little
old
this
isnt
an
especially
complex
stout
but
its
good
drinkable
when
i
give
the
glass
a
good
swirl
that
tan
head
comes
right
back
not
sure
what
exactly
that
indicates
but
i
like
it
enjoi
o
overall
i
think
this
was
a
great
represenatation
of
the
style
really
really
good
mouthfeel
and
appearance
helped
push
this
oatmeal
stout
along
o
the
silky
feel
matches
up
well
with
the
malty
goodness
but
as
i
drank
more
i
found
the
smoky
taste
built
too
much
4
poured
a
darkest
black
small
dark
tan
head
smell
was
more
bold
malts
and
oats
than
anything
else
taste
was
direct
and
simple
for
a
stout
id
say
which
is
to
say
it
was
good
deep
roasted
coffee
and
nottoobitter
chocolate
went
down
relatively
smooth
overall
id
sample
another
but
this
isnt
a
stout
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
overall
b
good
beer
would
recommend
trying
it
but
not
as
good
as
other
stouts
ive
tried
overall
very
good
not
outstanding
offering
by
rogue
i
couldnt
wait
to
cook
my
wet
aged
steak
to
have
this
beer
but
it
would
have
gone
perfectly
quite
a
hoppy
stout
thick
creamy
and
delicious
overall
sipper
but
great
to
share
and
sip
o
in
a
style
dominated
by
overpowering
high
abv
thickasmotoroil
stouts
this
beer
stands
out
as
a
shining
example
of
a
simpler
lighter
stout
that
still
has
plenty
of
gusto
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
beer
and
it
remains
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
rogue
family
this
beer
pours
a
thick
black
color
with
a
trace
of
tan
foamy
head
that
retains
slightly
and
leaves
little
lacing
the
aroma
has
strong
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
starts
smokey
and
has
notes
of
caramel
sweetness
then
finishes
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
harsh
and
lingering
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
almost
watery
with
a
smoky
bitter
finish
a
medium
body
thats
light
for
a
stout
and
a
nice
smooth
smoky
flavor
a
great
stout
highly
drinkable
and
extremely
enjoyable
a
masterpiece
shakespeare
aint
the
flavors
decent
but
the
bodys
lacking
3
the
price
i
probably
should
win
a
prize
for
being
the
1000000th
person
to
mention
this
but
i
dont
understand
rogues
inflated
price
point
pretty
good
stuff
as
i
mentioned
i
love
porters
due
to
their
drinkibility
and
mouthfeel
not
too
many
styles
have
the
ability
to
sip
or
slurp
all
the
while
enjoying
every
bit
of
it
i
was
turned
off
to
the
brew
in
terms
of
the
brewery
im
not
attracted
to
rogue
at
all
i
dont
digg
their
choice
of
styles
i
wish
they
made
more
lighter
beers
but
after
siipping
on
this
one
for
a
bit
ive
started
to
appreciate
rogue
not
as
a
brewery
but
as
crafters
they
really
do
put
a
lot
of
craftsmanship
into
their
products
and
ive
sorta
learned
to
enjoy
them
as
a
fine
bottle
of
wine
not
comparing
it
to
others
like
it
but
rather
enjoying
each
drink
for
what
it
is
and
how
much
soul
the
brewer
has
put
into
each
bottle
go
out
and
buy
one
if
your
a
fan
of
stouts
your
in
for
a
treat
stay
thirsty
my
friends
you
will
not
be
disappointed
by
this
beer
this
beer
pours
black
with
a
big
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
roasty
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
roasty
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
overall
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
top
5
i
have
had
portsmouth
and
mayflower
are
still
my
favorite
good
but
unengaging
due
to
lack
of
depth
the
mouthfeel
is
as
hearty
as
a
hawiian
death
metal
band
i
gave
this
beer
a
pretty
standard
pour
into
my
regular
pint
glass
and
it
gave
me
a
huge
two
finger
head
the
head
is
super
dark
darkest
head
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
the
last
head
that
i
drank
that
was
this
dark
was
a
homebrew
so
i
guess
this
will
be
a
quality
beer
the
head
is
mostly
small
bubbles
but
there
are
a
fair
amount
of
big
ones
here
as
well
somewhat
pillowy
look
to
it
but
a
little
soapy
too
overall
a
very
strange
looking
head
but
its
sticking
around
for
quite
a
while
and
its
giving
me
some
pretty
good
lacing
the
body
is
pitch
black
very
few
hints
of
born
in
this
beer
if
any
at
all
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
overall
it
looks
really
really
nice
the
smell
on
this
beer
is
absolutely
perfect
dark
malts
coffee
oats
smooth
big
everything
you
need
in
an
aroma
for
a
great
stout
perhaps
some
chocolate
in
here
as
well
but
just
overall
a
super
well
rounded
smell
with
all
the
necessary
smells
for
it
to
be
a
great
stout
what
i
really
appreciate
is
that
there
are
flavors
that
you
dont
necessarily
need
to
put
in
an
oatmeal
stout
but
you
can
if
you
chose
to
flavors
like
chocolate
and
coffee
those
flavors
are
necessary
but
they
are
for
sure
yummy
and
i
appreciate
that
rogue
put
them
in
here
and
put
them
in
well
just
a
great
roasty
smell
on
this
beer
wow
thats
a
good
beer
wow
this
beer
might
be
better
than
the
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
which
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
for
sure
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
had
ever
had
i
mean
its
just
so
perfect
nice
oatmeal
flavor
slight
alcohol
kick
small
small
coffee
flavor
not
too
much
chocolate
but
a
tiny
bit
dark
malts
in
the
perfect
amount
its
not
as
big
of
a
flavor
as
i
would
like
and
the
alcohol
is
a
tiny
bit
too
noticeable
but
then
again
it
is
6
1
abv
those
are
whats
keeping
me
from
giving
this
beer
a
5
and
maybe
it
doesnt
even
deserve
a
4
5
i
do
question
that
but
right
now
its
really
hitting
on
all
cylinders
for
me
its
a
really
really
solid
beer
anyway
you
slice
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
strange
for
an
oatmeal
stout
the
carbonation
is
a
little
high
and
the
body
is
a
tiny
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
the
body
and
mouthfeel
overall
still
work
for
the
beer
and
dont
kill
it
by
any
means
its
just
not
as
great
as
i
would
expect
with
the
amazing
taste
drinkability
is
amazing
its
a
super
easy
beer
to
drink
even
tho
the
alcohol
comes
at
you
a
tiny
bit
overall
a
really
great
beer
we
will
see
if
the
beer
changes
at
all
when
it
warms
but
my
guess
is
it
will
only
get
better
definitely
a
contender
for
best
oatmeal
stout
and
best
beer
ive
ever
had
still
not
bad
always
happy
with
rogues
offerings
o
well
rounded
roasty
stout
with
alot
of
charachter
o
awesome
oatmeal
stout
easily
drinkable
and
finished
my
whole
22oz
bomber
in
no
time
at
all
and
had
wishing
i
had
another
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
especially
if
you
enjoy
bitter
flavors
one
to
get
again
now
that
i
can
find
it
locally
again
really
a
nice
stout
almost
too
smooth
if
thats
possible
the
flavors
are
supremely
balanced
and
this
makes
for
a
very
fine
drink
d
good
but
i
think
id
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
have
this
one
again
william
shakespeare
romeo
juliet
ii
ii
o
nothing
to
get
either
really
excited
about
or
complain
about
very
average
i
might
feel
better
about
it
if
it
wasnt
so
pricey
would
have
preferred
to
taste
the
malt
more
o
this
beer
was
good
in
all
respects
but
lacked
something
special
to
make
it
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
would
recommend
but
think
there
are
others
i
would
reach
for
probably
just
personal
preference
i
think
it
was
the
burnt
overtones
that
drug
me
down
a
good
quality
oatmeal
stout
that
just
lacks
in
sweetness
and
has
too
much
roast
for
my
liking
not
the
most
affordable
bomber
but
still
a
quality
beer
all
around
o
not
sure
what
the
rave
is
all
about
with
this
one
its
overly
smoky
has
slight
roastcoffee
flavor
the
only
oats
i
get
are
of
the
dirtearth
variety
and
not
much
going
on
here
bit
of
a
disappointment
o
a
fine
afterdinner
brew
to
subin
for
your
coffee
or
espresso
with
dessert
shakespeare
would
pair
nicely
with
a
chocolate
torte
or
mousse
perhaps
but
its
just
as
fine
on
its
own
and
perfect
as
a
digestive
at
6
1
abv
not
too
heavy
with
enough
robust
character
to
put
a
cap
on
the
evening
o
almost
infallible
the
feel
definitely
turned
me
off
at
times
but
overall
its
very
wellcrafted
and
even
with
that
snag
i
still
consider
this
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
it
has
a
great
mixture
of
tastes
and
goes
down
smooth
definitely
something
to
savor
overalli
was
planning
on
drinking
this
one
slow
and
calling
it
a
night
but
the
bombers
gone
i
really
liked
this
beer
o
great
stout
that
paired
very
well
with
the
meat
i
was
having
at
the
time
take
the
time
to
enjoy
a
few
sips
before
the
meal
though
as
this
changes
the
taste
slightly
and
is
less
bitter
up
front
during
the
meal
o
a
classic
all
out
stout
a
big
bodied
beer
with
the
flavour
to
match
extremely
easy
drinking
an
exceptionally
good
oatmeal
stout
it
does
everything
right
drinkability
im
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
so
i
find
very
drinkable
its
not
a
session
or
lawn
mower
beer
but
i
could
put
a
couple
bottles
away
with
no
problem
d
its
very
good
nothing
overpowering
or
lacking
drinkability
rogue
fans
usually
cite
this
as
their
favorite
offering
and
i
can
see
the
appeal
good
balance
and
a
nice
blend
of
roast
flavors
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
ever
had
o
enjoyable
drinkable
doesnt
get
you
canned
in
a
single
22
i
brewed
a
batch
after
enjoying
this
beer
o
great
stuff
from
rogue
love
the
nuttiness
in
the
nose
wish
it
showed
up
stronger
in
the
taste
overall
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
the
complex
flavor
profile
indicates
the
quality
of
this
product
and
is
exactly
what
one
would
look
for
in
this
style
good
solid
stout
beer
would
not
turn
it
down
but
would
not
seek
it
out
happy
to
have
it
whenever
its
around
overall
i
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
just
a
tad
thicker
than
this
but
you
know
i
cant
complain
about
this
one
right
here
it
will
do
no
problem
i
drank
this
one
slowly
as
i
enjoyed
fish
and
chips
this
is
an
excellent
stout
regardless
of
the
nitrotap
and
i
hope
to
try
the
bottled
version
soon
overall
i
still
prefer
rogues
chocolate
stout
but
this
is
a
solid
workhorse
of
a
beer
and
always
worth
a
roll
o
decent
beer
but
not
a
go
to
for
stouts
or
oatmeal
stouts
uncertain
of
the
greatness
this
beer
has
acheived
provided
the
beer
is
quite
simple
o
this
is
one
of
rogues
better
beers
although
i
think
you
have
to
pay
a
little
too
much
for
what
you
get
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
something
that
often
gets
overlooked
because
of
how
common
it
is
there
is
alot
of
flavor
packed
into
this
somewhat
small
beer
d
the
drinkability
here
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again

d
not
bad
but
probably
the
worst
cask
beer
ive
ever
had
just
not
enough
flavor
going
on
o
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
however
i
would
have
liked
more
of
an
oatmeal
flavor
less
on
the
chocolate
overral
i
still
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
o
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
but
the
hops
knock
it
down
a
little
for
me
would
have
preferred
a
stronger
presence
from
the
oatmeal
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
theres
a
bit
more
that
can
be
done
here
especially
in
the
flavors
its
subtle
in
ways
i
dont
love
and
yet
its
so
balanced
it
works
a
great
stout
perhaps
not
but
a
very
good
one
wow
a
really
nice
selection
from
rogue
pours
a
black
with
a
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
smell
was
not
overpowering
some
roasted
malts
not
too
sweet
this
reminded
me
of
a
dry
irish
stout
maybe
thats
the
oatmeal
chocolate
notes
with
the
accompanying
bitterness
coffee
and
some
grain
smooth
and
drinkable
a
really
good
beer
well
balance
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
slightly
chocolately
sweetness
smooth
body
creamy
head
not
too
heavy
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
starts
out
more
on
the
bubbly
side
which
i
wasnt
expecting
given
that
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
as
it
warms
this
mellows
out
to
become
quite
a
smooth
drink
shame
on
me
for
drinking
it
too
fast
big
roasted
flavors
abound
but
are
wellbalanced
with
sweet
syrup
oats
and
milk
chocolate
faint
twiglike
flavor
on
the
finish
good
stuff
here
why
i
passed
over
this
for
so
long
annoys
me
ill
have
this
one
again
i
cant
wait
to
add
this
to
my
list
of
goto
favorites
definitely
having
these
in
stock
in
my
cabinet
di
expected
much
more
from
this
beer
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
whether
it
be
in
a
bottle
or
on
tap
anywhere
d
overall
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
as
it
goes
down
easy
although
the
lack
of
complexity
doesnt
lend
itself
to
wanting
a
whole
lot
d
a
good
repeatable
beer
would
have
another
4
6
abv
is
nice
and
drinkable
especially
when
in
the
bomber
size
has
a
heavy
mouthfeel
very
complex
beer
good
drinkibility
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
d
fairly
high
the
flavor
is
rich
and
the
hops
arent
too
much
the
finish
is
mellow
bittersweet
chocolate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
at
6abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
dark
black
with
some
brown
highlights
under
the
light
the
head
is
a
chunky
light
foamy
chocolatey
color
with
good
staying
power
aromas
of
coffee
nut
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
pepper
the
flavors
are
coffee
first
and
foremost
and
some
slightly
sweet
chocolatey
malt
that
helps
to
balance
the
bitterness
earthy
tones
highlight
and
there
is
a
robust
quality
that
does
not
go
unnoticed
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
in
mouth
despite
the
heavy
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
roasted
coffee
again
but
with
a
touch
of
booze
and
rich
dark
chocolate
smooth
and
crisp
finish
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
very
easy
to
consume
in
large
quantities
tasty
easy
to
drink
i
havent
been
a
huge
rogue
fan
so
far
but
this
is
one
nice
bomber
of
stout
drinkability
this
beer
is
most
definitely
worth
ones
time
and
effort
good
all
around
more
than
solid
easily
drinkable
it
could
almost
be
a
session
brew
thats
how
easy
it
went
down
perfect
for
a
chilly
evening
or
afternoon
would
even
be
good
as
a
night
cap
drink
good
into
stout
soft
and
very
drinkable
well
pairable
as
i
had
mentioned
and
did
so
with
a
nice
sirloin
brought
out
some
nice
flavors
and
sits
nicely
on
the
palate
d
overall
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
world
class
a
slight
overstatement
as
ive
had
better
but
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
nonetheless
easily
drinkable
though
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
id
take
a
6er
of
st
ambroise
oatmeal
over
this
one
but
not
to
be
taken
as
a
disappointment
taste
it
for
yourself
d
for
such
a
hoppy
and
bitter
stout
this
goes
down
very
well
i
would
not
call
this
a
session
stout
but
this
is
certainly
very
drinkable
nonetheless
drinkability
is
quite
good
with
a
tolerable
abv
an
enticing
scent
and
a
pleasing
taste
this
rogue
beer
is
a
great
candidate
to
share
with
friends
or
to
just
indulge
with
by
yourself
just
wish
all
of
their
brews
were
this
solid
like
many
stouts
i
drink
i
let
it
sit
out
for
awhile
so
that
it
would
be
a
bit
warmer
i
am
able
to
taste
more
if
i
do
so
the
shakespeare
is
definitely
complex
with
chocolate
sweetness
but
also
bitter
like
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
hops
made
themselves
known
too
although
its
complex
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
id
hoped
it
wasnt
too
complex
for
me
but
perhaps
the
complexities
didnt
all
add
up
for
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
d
very
drinkable
but
the
whole
lack
of
appropriate
body
makes
me
question
this
being
an
oatmeal
stout
at
all
d
like
a
lot
of
rogue
beers
this
is
good
but
not
amazing
and
not
really
worth
the
price
they
charge
goes
down
smooth
enough
very
easy
to
drink
great
beer
cheers
d
high
verdict
d
very
drinkable
nice
even
flavors
no
rough
edges
good
for
a
heavy
beer
maybe
a
little
filling
though
d
nice
heavy
stout
that
goes
down
easily
because
it
is
very
well
balanced
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
although
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
itlike
most
from
the
stylebecomes
a
bit
wearing
as
the
beer
goes
down
because
of
the
intensity
of
the
oats
and
malts
good
beer
though
overall
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
beer
but
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
the
flavor
and
the
body
were
much
thinner
then
i
was
expecting
in
an
oatmeal
stout
d
i
loved
this
brew
creamy
smooth
roasty
chocolate
a
little
chewy
grain
from
the
oats
perhaps
i
like
this
despite
the
higher
price
bomber
being
all
that
is
available
in
my
area
does
this
come
in
sixers
it
should
this
ranks
right
behind
sam
smith
in
my
book
d
a
good
beer
even
a
very
good
beer
but
maybe
not
quite
deserving
of
some
of
the
hype
it
gets
a
decent
winter
session
but
wasnt
particularly
impressed
i
was
left
wanting
a
more
full
and
smooth
stout
d
rogue
really
knows
how
to
make
a
nice
stout
although
personally
i
prefer
chocolate
stout
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
some
great
flavor
and
a
nice
feel
overall
a
big
thick
slowdrinking
beer
drinks
like
an
imperial
stout
no
alcohol
flavor
but
the
heaviness
seems
more
like
a
10
abv
than
6
an
impressive
stout
poured
black
with
a
very
large
light
brown
rocky
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
burnt
cereal
malts
mild
resin
hops
and
an
earthy
doughy
yeast
with
strong
notes
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
it
tasted
mildly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
coffee
at
first
then
went
to
a
slightly
bittersweet
coffee
flavor
that
had
a
nice
hint
of
chocolate
and
was
mildly
hoppy
at
the
finish
with
the
flavor
lingering
for
an
average
amount
of
time
mouthfeel
was
full
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
nice
stout

a
cold

pours
a
thick
black
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
slight
lacing
aromas
of
coffee
vanilla
malts
and
a
nice
overall
sweet
smell
taste
is
a
mix
of
vanilla
light
and
sweet
coffee
and
malts
this
one
is
a
bit
light
and
watery
but
does
have
a
decent
taste
good
stout
but
i
am
surprised
this
is
in
the
top
100
overall
its
worth
a
second
look
but
is
nothing
spectacular
the
cpj
taste
is
quite
bitter
from
the
dark
malts
not
much
for
hops
to
be
found
here
the
finish
is
super
dry
and
bitter
with
a
light
chocolate
flavor
lingering
for
a
bit
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
sharp
at
first
but
quickly
becomes
very
mellow
and
rich
this
is
very
well
done
i
will
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
again
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
drinkability
this
beer
has
an
average
drinkability
maybe
slightly
better
while
it
is
heavier
the
taste
remains
appealing
and
encouraging
throughout
the
course
of
a
pintsix
bottle
though
if
you
drink
it
too
slowly
the
carbonation
will
die
before
you
can
kill
the
volume
in
your
glass
drinkability
the
flavor
gets
more
bitter
with
each
sip
without
giving
me
enough
complex
flavor
to
make
it
truly
enjoyable
served
from

into
a

mug
poured
pitch
black
with
a
three
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
one
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
malt
and
slight
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
oatmeal
and
milk
chocolate
it
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
lowmild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
excellent
brew
a
very
easy
drinker
that
has
a
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
a
very
good
balanced
flavor
and
aroma
going
here
this
one
could
be
more
complex
to
help
it
be
great
but
it
is
still
very
good
d
the
beer
goes
down
rather
easily
although
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
because
of
the
bitterness
and
dryness
overall
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
much
better
always
avaliable
stouts
out
there
try
it
but
its
not
one
ill
be
keeping
around
doesnt
live
up
to
the
top
100
imo
pint
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
black
ale
with
a
big
beige
head
that
stays
the
entire
session
bitter
chocolate
aroma
with
some
cocoa
whiffs
and
roasted
dark
malts
very
bitter
taste
i
was
expecting
some
sweet
rush
on
the
taste
or
at
least
the
swallow
based
on
the
smell
but
there
is
none
to
be
had
black
coffee
slight
chocolate
and
malty
bitter
almost
sourlike
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
for
an
outmeal
stout
drinkability
was
ok
the
bitter
bitter
taste
put
me
off
a
little
i
may
have
had
a
bad
bottle
and
therefore
the
review
could
be
tainted
i
recall
drinking
this
fresher
and
getting
a
better
session
will
look
to
rereview
in
the
future
d
great
smell
pretty
good
flavor
delightfully
creamy
and
silky
id
recommend
this
if
you
like
stouts
overall
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
in
the
future
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
d
this
is
highly
drinkable
there
is
hardly
any
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
in
this
beer
a
great
winter
warmer
d
superduper
stout
the
stout
standard
bearer
the
burnt
malt
and
bitter
hops
flavors
are
great
and
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
not
a
criticism
but
the
chocolate
really
does
not
come
out
in
the
taste
other
than
balancing
out
the
bittering
hops
i
personally
like
this
but
be
advised
that
this
is
not
a
chocolate
beer
thin
texture
was
pleasing
in
this
case
this
was
an
easily
likable
beer
o
a
quite
pleasant
stout
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
most
average
oatmeal
stouts
i
would
buy
again
d
decent
drink
but
too
much
hops
and
burnt
malt
for
my
liking
in
an
oatmeal
stout
dthe
sour
and
astringent
back
end
really
hurt
the
drinkability
very
good
pour
from
a
bomber
dark
with
a
nice
light
amber
head
good
smell
not
too
strong
like
some
stouts
some
earthy
and
coffee
tones
tastes
good
at
first
drink
and
is
smooth
with
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
taste
lacks
the
creaminess
of
a
great
stout
also
like
the
rogue
chocolate
stout
it
almost
has
an
over
carbonated
feel
to
it
probably
would
not
buy
again
no
alcohol
presence
at
all
in
the
taste
making
this
dangerously
close
to
a
session
beer
something
that
you
can
drink
fairly
quickly
and
enjoy
the
flavor
but
not
feel
the
alcohol
d
would
sip
these
all
day
or
night
if
they
werent
7
a
bottle
the
taste
was
the
major
drawback
was
expecting
more
but
perhaps
that
is
the
draw
to
this
beer
a
great
balance
that
is
super
creamy
for
me
though
this
is
my
not
my
oatmeal
stout
poured
jet
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
hints
of
caramel
roasted
barley
in
the
aroma
very
very
smooth
with
a
creamy
malty
mouthfeel
with
a
blend
of
roasted
barley
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
a
coffee
after
taste
with
a
hop
bitterness
great
drinkability
lots
of
flavor
and
low
abv
what
else
do
you
want
this
was
a
drinkable
and
well
done
stout
though
it
wouldnt
be
my
personal
choice
as
best
for
the
style
i
recently
tried
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
and
enjoyed
it
but
i
felt
more
compelled
to
write
about
rogues
excellent
shakespeare
oatmeal
stout
i
love
the
balance
smooth
mouthfeel
the
roast
coffee
and
chocoloate
characteristics
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
am
not
a
habitual
stout
drinker
but
i
have
had
dark
brews
that
taste
like
soy
sauce
thats
certainly
not
the
case
here
the
shakespeare
oatmeal
stout
is
an
excellent
place
to
start
if
youre
exploring
this
style
then
you
might
also
enjoy
the
wolavers
d
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
not
as
creamy
as
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
head
leaves
great
lacing
and
the
taste
sticks
in
your
mouth
id
buy
it
again
but
i
think
there
are
better
oatmeals
out
there
with
more
bang
for
your
great

drunk
more
than
once
overall
a
decent
beer
but
the
palate
let
it
down
a
little
this
one
is
worth
trying
out
and
definitely
fits
the
bill
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
stout
though
i
certainly
wouldnt
recommend
going
out
of
your
way
this
is
a
good
beer
no
overpowering
flavors
its
creamy
and
alcohol
level
is
moderate
its
highly
drinkable
d
at
6
1
its
definitely
one
that
you
can
drink
a
bomber
or
2
of
quite
easily
d
a
decent
allaround
stout
for
the
style
and
however
i
will
look
elsewhere
drinkability
due
to
its
balance
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
didnt
really
live
up
to
its
reputation
from
a
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
large
wine
glass
pitch
black
color
with
thick
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
lacing
plenty
of
chocolate
flavor
rounded
out
with
ample
roasted
barleycoffee
flavor
slight
herbal
hoppiness
flavor
of
roasted
coffee
plenty
of
bitterness
hint
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
citrus
full
body
without
being
overly
sweet
d
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
rogue
never
lets
me
down
im
sure
ill
get
it
many
times
again
for
the
quality
and
the
price
this
one
is
definitely
a
pass
22oz
bottle
served
in
my
sam
smith
tulip
nonic
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
dense
rocky
mochacolored
head
that
sizzles
and
pops
and
slowly
recedes
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
with
a
few
spots
and
swaths
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
suggests
cocoa
however
it
seems
a
bit
chalky
as
well
as
a
slightly
metallic
quality
theres
also
a
trace
of
lactose
in
the
mix
taste
follows
nose
however
theres
also
a
roasted
character
and
a
slightly
burntashy
flavor
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
effervescence
and
a
semidry
finish
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
rogue
always
has
pretty
solid
brews
and
this
is
just
another
one
of
them
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
not
exactly
to
style
in
my
opinion
i
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
a
little
more
balanced
on
the
bitterness
scale
drinks
slightly
heavier
than
the
abv
indicates
but
thats
great
because
i
can
have
more
drinkabilty
well
its
soild
but
too
mild
on
flavors
i
wish
it
had
more
coffee
and
or
chocolate
to
it
you
could
easy
down
this
22ozer
as
usual
im
a
bit
dissapointed
with
another
rogue
beer
this
is
good
but
id
for
sure
take
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
over
this
overall
for
stouts
this
beer
faired
very
well
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
is
great
the
fragrance
is
excellent
the
only
down
side
to
it
is
that
im
sure
its
not
an
easy
find
on
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states
this
would
be
a
great
beer
paired
with
red
meat
like
a
steak
or
lamb
or
to
just
enjoy
by
itself
as
for
the
big
question
would
i
have
another
yes
i
would
enjoy
with
a
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
cant
find
any
fault
with
this
stout
its
an
american
twist
on
a
great
english
ale
i
would
still
prefer
a
samuel
smiths
but
thats
really
beside
the
point
rogue
should
be
very
proud
of
this
effort
d
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
nothing
is
too
overpowering
a
very
balanced
stout
overall
this
is
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
craft
stout
but
that
just
shows
me
that
there
are
many
things
to
learn
about
beer
i
look
forward
to
reviewing
more
very
soon
it
is
a
nice
and
creamy
stout
the
roasted
flavors
are
plentiful
i
have
never
tasted
this
beer
before
i
have
had
an
oatmeal
stout
before
and
it
tastes
similar
to
that
overall
its
pretty
good
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
dryness
not
exactly
what
i
would
want
from
the
style
it
was
ok
but
was
lacking
to
me
i
would
have
it
again
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
anytime
soon
overall
i
enjoy
this
one
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
i
still
like
the
doubleregular
chocolate
stout
better
but
this
is
right
behind
those
two
i
have
had
the
sam
smiths
oatmel
stout
as
well
and
i
must
admit
i
like
the
rogues
version
of
the
brew
alot
better
thanks
for
reading
and
have
a
drink
for
me
i
will
remember
this
beer
as
the
beer
that
made
me
recognize
the
common
flavour
found
in
rogue
beers
this
is
not
a
bad
stout
by
any
means
my
beer
doesnt
say
anywhere
that
its
an
oatmeal
stout
but
ba
says
so
not
really
getting
any
particular
oatmeal
stout
characteristics
from
this
though
a
bit
more
hops
on
the
nose
than
most
stouts
along
with
some
chocolate
and
ground
coffee
i
cant
shake
the
feeling
that
this
is
like
a
caricature
of
a
stout
like
its
trying
too
hard
ah
never
mind
me
im
just
jibbering
now
this
is
a
different
tasting
oatmeal
stout
earthy
hops
and
burnt
malts
with
a
chocolate
flavor
in
the
dry
finish
was
expecting
a
sweeter
flavor
but
this
is
very
good
stuff
none
the
less
d
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
but
not
my
favorite
looks
amazing
but
its
maybe
a
tad
too
hoppy
even
though
im
a
hophead
the
bitterness
is
welcomed
though
a
great
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
world
class
overall
excellent
beer
overall
i
would
recommend
trying
it
if
youve
never
had
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
some
ruby
red
when
held
to
the
light
creamybubbly
brown
head
that
sustained
and
left
some
nice
creamy
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
hazelnut
some
light
roast
sweet
maltiness
toffee
and
light
coffee
flavor
of
dark
chocolate
some
coffee
roasty
malts
nuts
and
maybe
a
light
hop
bitterness
left
a
lingering
coffee
grind
taste
in
your
mouth
dthis
is
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
not
quite
on
par
with
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
rogue
overall
solid
oatmeal
and
incredibly
representative
of
the
style
pours
with
heavy
full
brown
head
good
amount
of
head
right
out
of
the
bottle
sticks
around
quite
a
while
smell
is
of
bitter
chocolate
malts
caramel
and
some
light
notes
of
oatmeal
not
much
oatmeal
in
the
nose
however
more
comes
out
as
it
warms
and
brew
is
swirled
first
taste
is
dark
chocolate
and
malt
nice
smooth
taste
with
some
oatmeal
but
very
feint
oatmeal
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
and
swirled
similar
to
nose
overall
a
wonderful
dark
stout
with
great
flavor
and
depth
nice
body
smell
and
appearance
would
highly
recommend
for
anyone
a
fan
or
rogue
stouts
or
craft
beer
in
general
d
not
a
bad
stout
and
not
a
bad
price
if
looking
for
a
stout
would
give
this
a
try
again
d
very
nice
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
very
drinkable
for
such
a
rich
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
id
want
to
have
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
in
a
sitting
i
feel
like
this
one
definitely
pushes
the
style
limits
a
bit
could
probably
hold
its
own
against
much
bigger
stouts
in
a
tasting
d
just
because
of
the
heaviness
of
the
beer
id
say
it
has
a
moderate
drinkability
one
22oz
bottle
will
do
it
for
me
md
mediumheavy
body
with
a
bitter
finish
velvety
texture
nicely
carbonated
well
balanced
flavor
profile
d
nice
beer
flavor
kind
of
sticks
in
your
mouth
though
i
think
i
would
tire
soon
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
tan
head
and
left
lots
of
frothy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
had
some
roasitness
chocolate
malts
with
citrus
notes
and
also
some
hop
character
after
a
couple
whiffs
i
didi
manage
to
spot
out
a
little
coffee
aroma
as
well
the
flavors
were
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
consisting
of
the
chocolate
roastiness
upfront
along
with
coffee
citrus
and
hop
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
slight
sweet
and
slight
astringent
mouthfeel
from
the
coffee
but
it
didi
have
a
biiter
hop
finish
it
drank
quite
good
but
im
honestly
not
too
enthused
about
hoppy
oatmeal
stouts
pours
inky
black
with
a
short
crown
of
dark
tan
head
very
little
lacing
and
impossible
to
find
carbonation
if
its
there
i
cant
see
it
aroma
is
heavily
dominated
by
dark
roasty
malt
espresso
some
hint
of
bourbon
and
maybe
a
dark
chocolate
bar
wdried
cherries
in
it
complex
flavor
hints
at
guinness
with
a
very
dry
and
tangy
upfront
attack
almost
no
residual
sweetness
but
its
there
lots
of
espresso
in
the
flavor
evolves
into
this
espresso
slowly
and
with
great
complexity
finish
is
very
long
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
but
mostly
characterized
by
a
full
espresso
city
roast
that
lasts
and
lasts
very
delicious
and
generally
ok
priced
at
5
49bomber
a
classic
in
the
style
and
worth
seeking
out
d
this
went
down
with
the
quickness
along
with
a
healthy
portion
of
lamb
kabobs
and
hummus
from
my
local
kabobery
will
drink
again
asap
overall
very
solid
beer
worthy
of
a
top
250
spot
i
will
probably
have
again
and
would
recommend
you
try
this
one
out
for
yourself
looks
elegant
out
of
a
nitro
nice
and
frothy
creamy
that
fades
but
a
head
that
leaves
lace
nose
is
subdued
some
dough
and
chocolate
palate
is
a
bit
broader
chocolate
lace
of
carob
earth
and
tobacco
with
a
tad
bit
of
licorice
very
mild
leathery
most
say
that
its
an
awesome
example
but
ive
seen
some
equally
if
not
more
consistent
english
made
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
think
creamy
head
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
is
still
smooth
and
unbelievably
tasty
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
and
the
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
are
subtle
the
stout
is
very
well
balanced
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
had
and
was
totally
blown
away
by
it
a
disappointing
stout
not
a
worthy
of
an
a
let
alone
being
ranked
as
a
top
100
beer
based
on
these
nutty
rankings
cheers
mfd
incredibly
smooth
faint
bubbles
dance
across
the
tongue
before
dissolving
down
the
throat
easily
consumable
by
a
party
of
one
d
well
this
is
a
fine
anytime
beer
by
me
notes
a
nice
beer
with
a
lot
of
roasted
and
hop
flavors
lots
of
coffee
flavors
as
well
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
it
was
tasty
but
it
wasnt
top
notch
smooth
mouthfeel
but
seems
to
be
lacking
a
bit
in
body
feels
a
little
thin
but
not
too
noticeable
a
nice
balanced
stout
overall
good
to
have
on
occasion
overall
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
may
be
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
thats
widely
available
on
the
market
rogue
gets
a
lot
of
crap
from
many
craft
beer
elitists
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
d
i
will
have
to
try
this
in
bottle
forum
to
see
if
it
was
just
the
nitro
making
this
awesome
but
it
really
was
an
overall
soild
stout
with
really
nothing
off
putting
about
it
nice
offering
rogue
i
could
drink
this
one
all
happy
hour
d
at
6
abv
i
feel
like
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
thought
it
was
a
very
balances
solid
stout
i
would
definitely
try
again
dgreat
representation
of
the
style
creamy
texture
good
flavors
well
balanced
hop
profile
really
a
tasty
drink
a
great
stout
exemplary
of
the
oatmeal
style
reviewed
from
my
notes
the
beer
came
to
me
as
a
black
opaque
liquid
with
a
soapy
brown
head
i
could
smell
roasted
coffee
and
alcohol
aromas
the
tastes
included
chocolate
malts
light
sweetness
tobacco
and
some
some
coffee
bitterness
although
the
bitterness
was
slight
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
the
cask
delivery
method
made
it
feel
like
there
was
no
carbonation
also
at
low
levels
was
the
coating
but
a
lot
of
flavor
was
left
behind
in
that
meager
coat
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
but
the
bitterness
and
coffee
seems
a
bit
strong
to
me
maybe
i
would
have
better
enjoyed
the
nitrotap
version
that
was
also
on
offer
that
night
d
fine
taste
good
aroma
but
the
chalkiness
keeps
me
from
putting
this
in
the
a
category
d
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
in
a
night
i
like
oatmeal
stouts
but
this
one
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
a
pretty
good
brew
though
and
worth
the
try
drinkability
shakespeare
comes
in
a
bomber
but
i
could
easily
drink
two
taste
rich
full
bodied
stout
soe
mellow
chocolate
love
this
beer
t
fairly
balanced
but
it
leans
towards
a
roasty
bitterness
on
the
finish
starts
with
creamy
smooth
chocolate
that
segues
into
burnt
oats
and
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
pours
a
black
of
lights
bane
with
a
mocha
head
that
sticks
all
the
way
down
the
glass
quite
impressively
smell
is
a
caramel
malt
which
prominently
features
barley
and
oats
plus
a
tinge
of
citrus
hops
and
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
full
malt
up
front
barley
and
oats
with
the
strong
caramel
taste
and
the
citrus
hops
come
in
for
the
finish
the
malt
is
surprisingly
crisp
as
the
beer
is
all
around
and
the
hops
share
the
finish
well
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
which
blend
so
well
with
the
malt
incredible
mouthfeel
super
smooth
and
crisp
very
drinkable
as
while
it
is
full
flavored
it
is
not
thick
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
rogue
is
underrated
on
this
site
i
find
maybe
its
their
price
point
a
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
light
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
spotty
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
dark
malts
chocolate
oats
and
coffee
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
as
you
would
expect
with
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
oats
and
coffee
the
sweetness
fades
quickly
and
leaves
the
bitterness
of
dark
chocolate
and
pale
hops
the
aftertaste
is
bittersweet
smooth
and
crisp
medium
body
medium
carbonation
finish
is
slightly
sticky
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
like
the
fact
that
this
beer
isnt
as
sweet
as
most
stouts
are
and
even
though
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
ive
definitely
had
better
stouts
than
this
one
d
great
everyday
stout
the
lighter
body
ups
the
drinkability
a
bit
not
as
big
and
complex
as
the
stouts
i
usually
drink
but
certainly
not
something
id
pass
on
if
offered
it
looks
like
chocolate
syrup
or
turkish
coffee
brownish
black
and
very
thick
the
nose
is
big
on
mocha
heavy
with
chocolate
coffee
toasted
marshmallow
vanilla
amaretto
hazelnuts
and
a
touch
of
coconut
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
like
a
cafe
latte
deliciously
chocolatey
almost
as
much
so
as
an
actual
chocolate
stout
milk
duds
and
chocolate
chip
cookies
come
to
mind
though
it
is
rich
and
thick
the
overall
flavor
and
finish
are
bitter
so
this
doesnt
cloy
even
on
cask
fantastic
stuff
an
indecently
delicious
beer
highly
recommended
easy
drinking
bomber
pretty
damn
close
to
perfect
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
since
sam
smith
would
have
to
taste
side
by
side
to
see
which
is
better
drinkable
beer
a
lighter
body
stout
good
beer
to
end
a
meal
with
of
a
night
cap
the
color
is
a
deep
rich
brown
with
a
caramel
head
it
is
delightful
in
the
nose
smells
of
sweet
whole
grain
hearty
bread
it
is
bitter
at
the
first
sip
then
mellows
a
bit
to
a
full
rounded
tatse
bitter
up
front
sweet
and
hearty
in
the
back
it
is
well
balanced
for
a
heavy
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
even
for
someone
not
aquainted
with
big
beers
the
beer
is
little
heavy
but
would
pair
nice
with
a
roastbeef
sandwhich
or
definitely
sweet
deserts
pours
dark
black
with
a
big
creamy
brown
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
roasted
malt
aroma
with
chocolate
and
some
light
hops
the
taste
is
roasty
and
has
some
really
nice
bitterness
with
coffee
and
chocolate
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
lowish
abv
stout
which
i
like
drinkability
is
very
good
best
rogue
beer
ive
tried
to
date
beer
is
medium
bodied
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
body
out
of
this
honestly
i
mean
its
called
oatmeal
now
lets
do
it
beer
is
very
bitter
from
the
roasted
grains
leaves
a
lingering
taste
and
a
graininess
in
my
mouth
it
grows
in
harshness
the
more
i
drink
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
o
although
the
cost
is
a
bit
high
this
is
a
good
beer
i
cant
believe
that
i
waited
this
long
to
actually
review
it
since
ive
had
it
a
few
times
definitely
one
to
seek
out
on
tap
if
you
have
a
choice
served
dark
black
in
a
large
chalice
too
cold
from
the
bar
tap
as
usual
looks
like
a
soda
at
first
but
the
tight
brown
foam
sticks
very
closely
to
the
glass
awesome
lacing
nose
is
remarkably
hoppy
citrus
backed
up
by
espresso
the
profile
in
the
taste
cuts
both
ways
strong
bracing
hops
meet
in
the
middle
crashing
into
waves
of
coffee
and
roasted
barley
very
aggressive
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
belies
the
huge
flavor
super
hoppy
stout
and
still
a
favorite
after
all
these
years
about
a
9010
black
to
brown
color
ratio
on
the
pour
a
great
brown
head
with
medium
lacing
and
retention
faint
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
roasted
barley
and
a
little
more
hops
up
front
than
your
usual
stout
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
and
a
touch
of
oats
follow
and
linger
on
the
aftertaste
finishes
nice
not
dry
and
slight
sweetness
a
little
light
on
flavor
and
was
expecting
a
more
oatmeal
to
justify
the
namesake
creamy
mouthfeel
which
is
medium
bodied
medium
body
for
the
style
and
more
carbonation
than
i
would
expect
which
makes
this
a
nice
drinking
stout
that
could
easily
turn
into
two
or
three
before
you
know
it
i
can
see
myself
going
back
for
more
and
a
nice
offering
from
the
fellas
at
rogue
opaque
in
body
with
offwhite
head
light
aroma
of
chocolate
cream
subtle
citrus
from
hops
brown
sugar
dark
chocolate
flavors
coffee
roast
toast
slight
hop
bitterness
more
ashy
roast
towards
the
end
heavy
in
body
but
rather
refreshing
for
a
stout
and
doesnt
sit
heavily
on
the
belly
a
great
night
cap
that
can
accompany
dessert
or
just
be
had
by
itself
notes
i
was
completely
blown
away
by
this
ontap
my
brother
swears
by
it
so
i
finally
gave
it
a
try
expecting
strong
bitterness
and
charred
aspects
but
it
was
the
opposite
shakespeare
stout
poured
a
black
color
and
had
a
good
sized
ale
that
disapted
quickly
it
smelt
and
tasted
of
coffee
flavors
and
chocholate
it
was
strong
but
no
one
flavor
was
overpowering
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
not
the
best
but
very
enjoyable
serving
type
bottle
not
too
strong
easy
to
drink
i
could
finish
the
bottle
alone
in
a
short
time
d
very
drinkable
definitely
will
be
finishing
this
one
and
wishing
i
had
another
drinkability
it
is
easy
gong
down
and
not
too
big
or
difficult
to
drink
it
is
sweet
enough
that
im
enjoying
it
as
desert
and
i
think
would
be
best
enjoyed
in
this
type
of
setting
d
really
drinkable
stout
it
doesnt
have
that
creamy
goodness
youd
expect
from
an
irish
stout
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
doesnt
go
down
smooth
it
just
goes
down
differently
regardless
its
very
drinkable
and
something
ill
definitely
look
to
buy
again
this
was
my
favorite
rogue
brew
ive
had
thus
far
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
this
is
very
different
from
what
i
thought
it
would
be
hoppy
yet
balanced
good
chocolate
in
a
regular
stout
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
moderate
to
low
carbonation
the
oats
give
it
a
little
creamy
mouthfeel
which
i
always
love
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
good
tasting
and
flavorful
stout
d
the
unified
taste
and
light
feel
make
it
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
came
back
to
it
after
several
years
away
and
now
i
regret
the
hiatus
much
preferred
over
the
rogue
mocha
porter
d
everything
here
was
good
but
for
some
reason
it
just
really
wasnt
drawing
me
back
for
more
four
years
later
this
is
still
perfect
instantly
my
my
fav
rogue
brew
overall
another
fantastic
stout
i
must
say
that
rogue
does
make
the
best
stouts
always
consistent
and
always
flavorful
while
being
able
to
maintain
the
style
really
great
appearance
rich
and
dark
nose
has
some
the
standard
stout
stuff
but
a
nice
slightly
sweet
balance
as
well
great
stout
flavor
all
the
right
combination
of
components
really
pure
and
pristine
tastes
like
what
a
stout
should
be
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
slainte
pours
thick
and
heavy
with
a
solid
black
body
a
large
bubbly
tan
head
which
fades
quickly
leaving
a
thin
creamy
layer
and
medium
carbonation
the
aroma
a
full
of
roasted
malts
light
coffee
some
notes
of
peat
and
mild
milk
chocolate
the
taste
has
lots
of
rich
bitter
chocolate
with
strong
espresso
from
the
heavy
roasted
malts
and
some
really
earthy
soil
in
a
good
way
flavours
it
leaves
a
bitter
lasting
aftertaste
just
like
a
good
espresso
full
bodied
with
a
heavy
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
very
noticeable
carbonation
great
beer
definitely
one
for
people
into
their
heavy
bitter
stouts
this
beer
poured
black
with
a
fine
two
finger
head
nose
is
of
chocolatecoffee
roasted
malts
taste
is
a
delight
a
perfect
balance
between
the
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
a
generous
portion
of
cascade
hops
with
hints
of
coffee
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
but
is
very
creamy
and
lively
overall
drinkability
is
great
i
have
been
dissapointed
with
the
change
in
taste
with
beers
on
nitrotap
but
this
one
did
not
dissapoint
its
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
and
i
cant
say
it
really
breaks
any
boundaries
but
its
solid
and
quite
drinkable
excellent
overall
something
sir
john
falstaff
would
have
enjoyed
for
sure
a
very
good
stout
i
tend
to
get
full
after
about
two
pints
but
i
can
usually
squeeze
in
a
third
an
oatmeal
variant
of
their
famous
and
highly
rated
shakespeare
stout
which
is
one
of
my
faves
it
pours
a
beautiful
opaque
nearmidnight
black
with
a
thick
finebubbled
persistent
dark
tan
head
strong
aroma
is
richly
of
fine
coffee
and
quality
chocolate
very
tempting
flavor
is
like
a
fine
mocha
quality
roast
coffee
and
good
chocolate
not
too
sweet
hints
of
molasses
texture
is
smooth
tingly
and
fizzy
leaving
a
slightly
sweet
and
very
pleasing
finish
a
must
for
stouties
pours
out
pitch
black
with
a
nice
two
finger
very
dark
tan
head
that
retains
very
well
and
leaves
a
medium
coat
of
lacing
the
ring
and
cloud
on
the
beer
is
very
thick
and
makes
for
a
very
nice
looking
beer
smell
has
notes
of
coffee
oatmeal
roast
malts
cocoa
and
some
hops
the
balance
is
nice
but
the
strength
could
be
better
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
the
better
strength
the
roasty
malts
and
coffee
cocoa
notes
are
very
nice
the
oatmeal
is
amazing
in
this
beer
and
lends
that
unique
sweetness
there
are
some
earthy
and
piney
hops
that
finish
off
a
very
good
balanced
taste
the
mouthfeel
should
be
better
for
an
oatmeal
stout
the
body
feels
a
tiny
bit
watery
the
carbonation
is
lowmedium
and
feels
nice
with
the
flavors
the
oatmeal
smoothness
is
nice
but
the
watery
body
needs
to
be
thickened
a
coat
of
hops
and
roast
malt
stays
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
beer
rogue
offers
good
beers
at
great
prices
the
taste
is
very
nice
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
need
to
up
the
body
d
high
it
tastes
alot
bigger
than
six
percent
so
i
could
put
some
bombers
down
one
tasty
brew
but
form
rogue
i
would
not
expect
anything
less
pours
black
in
color
with
a
darkly
tanned
head
little
bit
of
lacing
is
found
on
the
glass
and
head
has
but
minor
powers
of
retension
nose
is
a
full
mixture
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
chocolate
taste
is
fairly
bitter
upfront
from
a
combo
of
burnt
grain
hops
and
strong
black
coffee
faintly
picking
up
on
yeast
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
as
the
beer
reaches
room
temperature
medium
to
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
to
light
feel
overall
decent
with
an
unexpected
amount
of
citrus
hops
evident
skimmed
through
some
other
reviews
apparently
this
is
quite
hoppy
when
it
is
fresh
but
goes
downhill
fairly
quick
however
since
theres
no
bottle
dating
its
hard
to
know
what
one
is
going
to
get
ill
rereview
if
i
see
it
ontap
d
a
fantastic
stout
that
if
you
share
out
of
a
22
oz
like
me
will
leave
you
begging
for
more
d
a
fine
stout
from
rogue
although
i
found
the
bitterness
to
be
just
a
bit
too
obtrusive
and
sharp
the
flavor
was
very
good
but
its
assertive
bitter
character
meddled
with
the
balance
of
the
stout
overall
never
save
shakespeare
d
i
killed
the
bomber
by
myself
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
more
the
low
abv
allows
this
not
great
overall
but
i
will
def
purchase
this
one
again
d
for
me
shakespeare
stout
is
the
definition
of
drinkability
obviously
were
not
talking
a
thirst
quencher
that
youre
going
to
turn
to
to
sate
your
thirst
what
were
talking
is
a
beautiful
work
of
art
that
youre
going
to
enjoy
several
pints
of
on
a
quiet
evening
relishing
lifes
simple
pleasures
not
that
this
is
a
simple
beer
but
you
get
my
meaning
d
good
drinkability
lower
abv
roasted
flavors
might
be
overwhelming
for
some
after
a
few
d
as
i
said
good
but
not
great
very
dark
aroma
look
and
flavor
excellent
stout
d
goes
down
really
smooth
a
real
pleasure
throughout
the
drink
and
that
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
allow
for
consumption
of
the
entire
bomber
without
any
major
inebriating
effects
ive
had
this
several
times
in
the
bottle
but
never
on
tap
yet
my
opinion
of
it
stays
the
same
this
is
just
a
very
well
crafted
american
stout
with
lots
of
full
flavors
and
a
smooth
easy
drinking
body
bottle
or
draft
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
rogue
and
one
that
i
would
never
turn
down
drinkability
great
drinkability
and
well
carbonated
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
but
not
too
heavy
as
some
stouts
tend
to
be
at
6
00
abv
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
this
style
gets
the
best
aspects
of
this
beer
are
the
roasted
meltedchocolate
aroma
and
the
relatively
easygoing
drinkability
for
this
time
of
the
year
its
about
as
good
as
it
gets
even
if
you
want
to
down
the
whole
bottle
by
yourself
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
highly
overrated
as
there
are
plenty
of
other
better
options
in
this
arena
around
this
price
i
would
still
buy
it
again
if
the
selection
is
poor
but
i
have
lots
to
choose
from
in
my
area
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
steak
on
a
cold
day
luckily
i
currently
have
all
three
great
beer
snow
and
a
juicy
kc
strip
dits
crisp
finish
and
wonderfully
balanced
complex
taste
make
this
beer
highly
drinkable
and
is
one
of
the
finest
example
of
stouts
around
imo
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
stout
a
very
well
crafted
stout
simple
yet
refined
complex
yet
approachable
great
stuff
d
another
good
session
beer
from
rouge
not
lacking
in
any
areas
and
well
worth
trying
with
out
doubt
d
incredible
low
abv
and
gigantic
flavor
make
this
brew
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
d
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
have
this
one
i
had
passed
it
over
time
and
again
im
glad
i
got
it
on
tap
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
bombers
of
this
one
in
the
future
as
it
is
a
well
blended
and
damn
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
but
very
silky
drinkability
was
good
and
it
didnt
fill
me
up
as
other
stouts
tend
to
do
a
great
example
of
an
american
stout
notes
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
which
is
not
my
favorite
style
and
frankly
the
brewer
is
not
my
favorite
either
while
i
have
never
tried
this
sidebyside
this
beer
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
stone
12th
anniversary
bitter
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
big
chocolate
aroma
mixed
with
floral
hops
pours
pure
black
with
a
thick
rocky
brown
head
loses
some
points
because
the
head
dissipates
a
little
too
quickly
for
a
stout
tastes
of
bitter
hops
with
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
but
the
carbonation
is
pleasant
lingering
chocolate
and
bitter
finish
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
stout
but
it
leaves
a
bit
of
room
for
improvement
pours

dark
chocolate
bitterness
lingers
on
that
back
of
the
tongue
carbonation
is
mild
with
an

mouthfeel
typical
stout
drinkability
md
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
to
it
went
down
pretty
easy
carbonation
felt
right
and
the
beer
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
over
a
good
stout
but
i
have
had
better
but
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
d
im
very
impressed
by
this
stout
a
very
well
crafted
american
stout
one
that
all
other
stouts
should
be
measured
by
if
you
havent
tried
this
yet
get
out
there
and
buy
a
bottle
you
will
not
be
disappointed

an
almost
woody
smell
alcohol

not
overpowering
tastewise
this
has
a
nice
hit
of
smoke
up
front
and
then
surprises
with
an
almost
fruity
flavor
on
the
back
what
a
surprising
treat
good
stuff
this
is
super
smooth
for
a
stout
the
drinkability
is
high
on
this
which
could
lead
to
trouble
for
me
highly
recommended

dark

opaque
brown
with
a
two

golden
brown
head
aromas
of
chocolate
primarily
with
some
hints

citrus
blending
in
taste
is
definitely
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
though
i
thought
i
detected
a
bit
of
a
metallic
zing
at
the
very
end
not
sure
what
that
was
about
very
nice
feel
for
a
stout
carbonation
was
not
over
abundant
and
the
hops
added
some
oiliness
on
the
finish

very
good

heavy
with
low
carbonation
levels
causing
the
drink
to
flow
slowly
and
coating
the
palate
with
the
velvety
brew
the
finish
fades
ever
so
slowly
with
a
sweeter
toffee
flavor
leaving
a
longing
for
another
sip
m
d
for
a
beer
brewed
with
rolled
oats
i
would
have
expected
more
creaminess
in
the
body
that
said
it
still
has
a
plenty
of
body
and
the
mouthfeel
certainly
isnt
bad
in
the
least
so
i
cant
bring
myself
to
take
marks
on
a
point
that
is
being
influenced
by
something
i
feel
could
be
suggestive
its
an
excellent
stout
doesnt
go
over
the
top
with
alcohol
heavy
body
or
so
forth
but
it
offers
an
excellent
flavour
and
great
balance
wow
this
is
amazing
black
body
with
tan
head
rich
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
with
taste
to
follow
complex
and
rich
in
perfect
balance
theres
all
sorts
of
stuff
going
on
here
molasses
toffee
pumpernickel
the
works
this
is
the
best
stout
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
with
its
low
abv
compared
to
some
of
its
compadres
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
session
stout
overall
from
the
somewhat
limited
amount
of
rogue
products
ive
had
this
one
is
the
best
to
date
the
balance
is
superb
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
dry
an
excellent
stout
and
highly
recommended
one
really
positive
note
the
head
retention
amazed
me
down
to
the
last
drop
one
little
swirl
and
the
beer
was
blanketed
with
a
nice
layer
of
khaki
colored
foam
if
lacking
in
taste
this
beer
has
some
great
visual
appeal
pours
straight
black
with
a
nice
full
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
as
long
as
i
wish
the
head
does
leave
nice
lacing
behind
though
smellsof
dark
roasted
coffee
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
as
well
this
beer
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
with
some
light
hints
of
chocolate
has
a
bit
of
sweet
licoricy
finish
though
its
not
a
favorite
of
mine
its
still
a
very
solid
stout
at
first
i
didnt
like
it
because
it
was
not
syrupy
and
like
drinking
coffeeflavored
motor
oil
perhaps
this
was
because
we
had
been
talking
about
dark
lord
for
a
bit
but
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
think
i
was
too
quick
to
rush
a
judgment
what
struck
me
most
was
the
mouthfeel
which
was
smooth
and
almost
watery
as
opposed
to
the
thick
viscosity
of
the
russian
imperial
style
stouts
but
perhaps
because
its
not
one
of
those
hit
you
in
the
face
stouts
it
makes
for
a
more
drinkable
beverage
like
i
could
have
more
than
one
glass
likewise
the
roasted
malt
flavors
and
coffeeness
are
more
subdued
i
think
i
even
got
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
in
there
too
but
it
doesnt
coat
your
tongue
or
leave
a
lasting
coffee
bitterness
all
in
all
id
like
to
try
this
again
and
i
wont
shy
away
from
buying
it
next
chance
i
get
a
pleasantly
solid
example
of
the
style
offering
the
expected
silken
bearing
as
well
as
the
wellrounded
flavour
if
not
the
weight
or
abv
of
a
much
bigger
beer
im
sure
the
ol
bard
would
have
appreciated
this
one
there
is
definitely
a
chunk
of
yeast
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
this
beer
is
alive
kudos
the
rogue
for
including
the
ingredients
there
are
several
types
of
malts
including
crystal
and
chocolate
the
beer
uses
cascade
hops
along
with
oats
and
wheat
the
latter
two
are
interesting
in
this
beer
the
oats
create
the
slightly
watery
but
ultra
smooth
and
creamy
feel
in
the
beer
while
the
wheat
adds
a
bit
of
pricklishness
in
the
mouthfeel
to
balance
out
against
the
silky
oats
the
beer
is
definitely
more
dry
than
sweet
with
a
biting
and
bittering
dark
chocolate
finish
with
some
coffee
roasted
notes
in
there
too
the
charred
dark
roast
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
and
the
beer
is
substantial
yet
warming
the
abv
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
nice
dark
slightly
bittering
dryish
stout
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
powder
coming
in
at
the
very
end
its
a
fairly
complex
beer
worth
seeking
out
poured
inky
black
with
a
towering
dark
brown
head
thick
rings
of
lace
appear
as
the
head
slowly
shrinks
down
the
smell
is
bold
to
say
the
least
big
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
with
cc
cookies
and
hops
wow
big
time
flavor
here
darkest
chocolatebitter
even
with
roasted
coffee
bean
and
sugary
black
malt
brown
sugar
too
and
a
small
molasses
kick
rounded
out
with
a
bitter
punch
from
the
semisweet
chocolate
and
alpha
acids
in
the
hops
robustly
hoppy
for
the
style
and
it
only
adds
that
much
more
to
the
beer
insanely
thick
and
vicious
mouthfeel
one
could
chew
on
for
hours
at
a
time
a
remarkable
beer
one
of
the
finest
examples
in
existence
and
a
must
try
for
any
serious
connoisseur
another
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
started
ill
always
go
back
to
this
one
has
all
the
character
of
the
higher
abv
examples
just
on
feel
and
flavor
alone
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
think
this
beer
was
9
not
6
overall
a
incredibly
well
balanced
and
drinkable
stout
recommended
you
get
a
smooth
robust
and
chewy
drinking
experience
with
this
one
notes
a
very
good
plain
stout
probably
would
compete
with
sn
stout
for
my
go
to
regular
stout
d
fairly
high
i
have
a
second
if
i
had
it
very
good
beer
another
winner
from
rogue
in
case
i
didnt
say
it
enough
this
is
surprisingly
good
for
rogue
overall
i
have
a
feeling
i
wont
be
able
to
finish
this
and
if
i
do
it
will
take
me
several
hours
this
beer
doesnt
flow
at
all
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
in
which
i
will
reevaluate
next
time
i
drink
it
but
this
beer
isnt
very
good
at
all
i
cant
recommend
this
even
in
the
slightest
way
the
taste
is
smooth
toastyfruitiness
with
hints
of
singed
herbs
light
hint
of
burnt
caramel
stewed
prunes
licorice
hint
of
chocolate
it
is
smooth
but
zesty
and
lively
with
slight
oiliness
giving
a
nice
feel
that
is
solid
yet
not
heavy
and
still
fairly
engaging
it
has
light
swetness
to
a
dryish
slightly
creamy
finish
when
too
cold
the
finish
and
lingering
aftertaste
are
lopsidedly
bitter
but
if
warmed
the
finish
is
balanced
and
dry
yet
creamy
leaving
a
lingering
afteraste
of
coffeecaramel
candies
with
toastiness
drinkability
not
the
most
complex
stout
but
the
flavors
here
are
as
pronounced
as
i
have
had
in
any
beer
i
will
look
for
this
again
but
only
one
at
a
time
a
very
solid
offering
d
a
highly
drinkable
stout
i
think
this
should
be
called
their
chocolate
stout
instead
because
of
the
strong
chocolate
theme
throughout
drinkability
i
rate
this
stout
well
in
this
department
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
while
still
enjoying
it
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
enjoy
cheers
drinkability
i
probably
had
my
first
one
of
these
12
years
ago
now
it
obviously
blew
me
away
then
but
it
holds
up
well
different
due
to
the
hoppiness
but
very
tasty
lowish
abv
makes
it
possible
to
down
the
bomber
easily
didnt
think
i
would
end
up
rating
this
one
so
high
but
its
just
great
and
a
decent
value
too
the
drink
itself
is
terrific
the
rich
characteristics
of
the
beer
make
it
a
real
treat
it
is
bold
and
very
creamy
great
beer
delicious
and
moderate
alcohol
content
that
along
with
my
devotion
to
delicious
black
coffee
i
find
it
to
be
extremely
drinkable
d
the
smell
is
inviting
but
the
taste
does
not
follow
through
as
well
as
i
hoped
its
still
a
decent
stout
uscaptainsblog
blogspot
com
drinkability
a
fine
example
of
the
style
another
home
run
from
rogue
i
like
a
good
bitter
beer
stones
ruination
ipa
and
their
imperial
russian
stout
dogfish
heads
120
even
rogues
imperial
ipa
all
of
those
are
very
different
from
this
beer
and
theres
just
something
about
it
i
am
not
quite
thrilled
about
otherwise
a
good
beer
though
i
think
it
may
be
overated
di
think
the
drinkability
is
rather
high
its
not
too
strong
despite
the
catagory
but
maintains
a
superior
tastiness
throughout
that
makes
you
want
to
have
another
i
would
like
to
think
of
this
brew
as
getting
the
best
of
the
stout
world
without
having
to
get
shitfaced
in
the
process
but
if
you
do
i
dont
think
id
blame
ya
one
shade
below
black
with
an
enormous
head
of
lighttan
foam
the
head
retention
is
incredible
and
keeps
a
decent
layer
of
foam
covering
the
surface
of
the
beer
and
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
features
a
strong
roasted
malt
character
with
a
dark
chocolate
undertone
and
a
bit
of
a
citrusy
american
hop
its
good
but
could
be
stronger
and
a
bit
more
polished
the
flavor
starts
with
the
roasted
malt
flavors
and
a
hint
of
coffee
then
gradually
slips
into
the
softer
dark
chocolate
notes
eventually
it
finishes
with
a
resinous
hop
character
that
slowly
drys
the
palate
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
this
coupled
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
provides
for
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
at
first
i
felt
this
one
was
too
rough
around
the
edges
but
as
it
warmed
it
definitely
improved
and
everything
seemed
to
blend
quite
nicely
a
damn
good
stout
thats
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
one
that
i
could
definitely
see
in
my
regular
rotation
not
my
favorite
but
its
up
there
d
really
nice
stout
that
isnt
overpowering
d
another
bomber
im
glad
to
be
not
sharing
d
a
wise
choice
at
any
time
this
isnt
to
strong
or
weak
in
any
spectrum
very
well
balanced
find
it
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
overall
just
a
great
drinker
really
nice
and
roasty
and
dry
and
balanced
to
perfection
i
throughly
enjoyed
this
one
glad
its
always
available
at
my
local
stop
this
beer
pours
as
black
as
night
with
a
one
finger
cappicino
laced
headit
has
aromas
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
on
smell
it
smells
like
a
perfectly
balanced
stout
between
sweet
and
bitterit
has
a
nice
dense
mouthfeel
with
a
big
oat
driven
feel
first
up
then
the
palette
is
balanced
out
by
a
rather
hoppy
bittersweet
mellow
chocolate
aftertaste
to
really
not
make
this
beer
as
sweet
as
it
sounds
on
its
description
on
the
back
of
the
bottlei
really
like
this
beer
and
once
again
im
stoked
that
this
brewery
continues
to
send
its
brews
to
our
shores
thanks
rogue
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
by
rogue
and
thats
pretty
legit
cause
all
thier
beers
are
wonderful
overall
this
beer
was
a
good
all
around
stout
good
aromas
and
a
delicious
pallate
too
bad
this
isnt
offered
in
6
packs
around
here
d
pretty
nice
stout
with
a
decent
flavor
worth
getting
again
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
head
that
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
not
so
sweet
but
bitter
black
coffee
and
dark
semisweet
chocolate
mouth
feel
was
medium
to
full
bodied
with
fairly
minimal
carbonation
drinkability
was
good

abv
a
plus
in
this
category
reminded
me
of
sns
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
d
for
a
stout
it
goes
down
well
its
not
a
dessert
beer
so
im
not
chugging
it
for
the
sugary
taste
but
it
definitely
drinks
well
for
the
style
overall
the
cask
version
seemed
to
have
a
lot
more
hops
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
than
i
remembered
from
the
bottle
version
even
without
the
hops
the
malt
bill
is
fantastic
enough
to
make
this
worth
a
shot
drinkability
possibly
a
little
too
drinkable
d
ill
drink
again
without
hesitation

very
very

way
better
than
a
guiness
very
tasty
smooth
i
will
be
repeating
this
beer
dark
black
color
with
a
nice
cloudy
looking
head
the
head
sticks
well
to
the
glass
and
the
color
is
beige
the
aroma
is
dark
chocolate
with
some
roasted
malts
i
get
also
some
hints
of
licorice
very
light
licorice
however
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
very
good
too
easy
to
drink
medium
body
the
taste
stays
in
the
mouth
slightly
not
overpowering
i
would
prefer
that
it
stays
longer
the
bitterness
is
light
a
very
harmonious
beer
a
rich
beer
the
carbonation
is
felt
in
the
mouth
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
one
mostly
roasted
bitter
coffee
a
little
dark
chocolate
around
the
middle
many
better
stouts
out
there
some
bitter
astringency
on
the
finish
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
i
thought
this
would
be
much
better
based
on
the
reviews
and
the
fact
that
i
really
enjoy
the
chocolate
stout
and
the
hazelnut
brown
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
just
an
off
day
as
far
as
taste
goes
but
this
beer
did
not
match
previous
reviews
will
try
again
soon
after
being
unimpressed
by
a
rogue
dead
guy
ale
a
couple
years
back
i
had
not
bothered
to
try
another
rogue
offering
until
now
this
shakespeare
stout
will
not
emerge
as
one
of
my
favorites
but
it
has
at
least
convinced
me
to
try
other
rogue
offerings
in
the
future
after
trying
this
brew
i
was
shocked
to
find
that
it
contained
oats
it
just
did
not
seem
akin
to
other
oatmealish
stouts
which
i
tend
to
like
the
pour
produced
a
strong
mediumtodark
shiny
foamy
and
persistent
head
so
far
so
good
the
smell
struck
me
as
predominantly
coffee
and
not
especially
complex
as
stouts
go
the
taste
seemed
more
like
that
of
irish
dry
stouts
like
guinness
sharp
and
heavy
on
the
roasted
barley
but
absent
was
the
rounded
slightly
sweet
and
chewy
richness
from
the
oats
things
were
better
in
the
mouthfeel
department
where
the
oats
made
an
appearance
to
provide
this
stout
with
a
good
creamy
sensation
and
a
pleasant
malty
aftertaste
what
lingers
on
the
tongue
however
was
a
return
to
the
coffee
flavors
this
was
not
a
plus
for
me
since
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
otherwise
there
was
more
of
a
hops
presence
which
is
to
be
expected
with
a
brew
that
is
described
as
an
american
stout
dont
drink
this
if
you
are
seeking
a
more
malty
rounded
englishstyle
brew
for
me
i
did
not
dislike
it
but
i
am
not
likely
to
seek
it
out
in
the
near
future
my
tasting
was
an
isolated
experience
it
would
be
interesting
to
taste
this
sidebyside
with
other
microbrew
stouts
just
take
100
bucks
and
bye
about
15
bombers
for
the
next
couple
of
months
as
this
isnt
a
serious
session
beer
anyway
its
too
dam
flavorful
and
chewy
to
session
d
i
would
drink
this
everyday
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
the
initial
taste
is
full
of
the
roasted
malt
and
grain
with
some
of
the
bittersweet
or
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
coming
in
towards
the
end
i
can
pick
up
a
few
coffee
undertones
after
a
few
sips
too
the
beer
is
damn
smooth
and
creamy
and
has
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
going
on
this
stout
has
a
light
to
medium
body
and
very
rich
id
say
this
stout
has
such
a
high
drinkability
a
bomber
of
this
would
be
easily
be
finished
in
a
nights
session
by
myself
this
beer
poured
an
inky
black
with
a
singlefinger
dark
tan
head
the
smell
is
deeply
toasted
malt
with
a
strong
sweet
molasses
and
chocolate
backbone
with
a
bit
of
imperial
stoutstyle
coffee
in
there
as
well
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
milk
chocolate
that
goes
into
some
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
and
i
will
most
definitely
be
picking
it
up
again
sometime
d
this
stout
definitely
tastes
better
cold
than
warm
as
it
warmed
it
became
almost
too
bitter
still
a
very
enjoyable
stout
i
just
need
to
drink
it
faster
poured

easy
to
drink
appropriate
carbonation
with
a
medium

full
body
finish
is
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
bitter
and
astringent
mouthfeel
thats
surprisingly
welcome
good
drinkability
other
than
the
bitterness
d
excellent
dessert
beer
enough
uniqueness
to
hunt
this
one
down
appearance
a
very
dark
brown
only
hints
of
light
shine
through
very
fickle
two
finger
head
good
ammount
of
chocolate
malt
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tiny
bit
watery
but
very
relaxing
to
drink
ive
had
this
before
and
ill
have
it
again
one
of
rogues
strongest
beers
while
a
fine
offering
on
its
own
this
sonnet
is
perhaps
best
served
cold
however
it
will
also
compliment
any
beef
dish
very
drinkable
for
the
style
it
is
wellbalanced
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
never
gets
too
carried
away
but
theres
enough
in
there
for
everyone
to
enjoy
not
quite
first
rate
for
me
but
very
good
pours
nice
thick
dark
brown
big
mocha
head
with
excellent
retention
smells
rich
and
some
excellent
aroma
hoppage
going
on
taste
is
supersmooth
very
rich
despite
having
the
texture
and
viscosity
of
milk
silky
nice
hop
afterflavor
helps
part
aside
the
deep
dark
malt
more
chocolatey
and
hoppy
than
anything
else
can
be
a
bit
much
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
still
quite
excellent
a
very
good
stout
from
rogue
that
is
very
drinkable
really
enjoyable
and
the
quality
is
always
there
great
beer
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
very
light
aroma
but
a
touch
of
chocolate
flavors
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
is
nice
and
rich
with
a
great
mouth
feel
feels
velvety
on
the
tongue
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
full
bodied
and
with
a
soft
carbonation
this
is
a
milky
creamy
stout
good
drinkability

wonderful
d
this
is
packed
with
flavour
and
so
much
so
that
it

almost
hard

6
abv
makes
this
a
very
easy
going
stout
my
glass
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
even
though
i
was
attempting
to
take
my
time
a
very
nice
example
of
an
american
stout
d
a
delicate
stout
6
abv
is
a
nice
treat
this
is
what
id
call
a
great
pub
stout
you
want
a
nice
beverage
but
you
dont
want
to
be
overwhelmed
poured
a
thick
black
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
left
spider
lacing
all
down
glass
a
woody
burnt
malt
smell
with
a
mix
of
caramel
dark
chocolate
malt
real
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
balance
between
sweet
and
dry
pleasant
mix
of
bitter
chocolate
with
some
roasted
and
possibly
coffee
malt
minor
hop
bitterness
on
the
very
backend
although
the
malts
do
the
talking
low
abv
makes
this
a
possible
session
but
1
bottle
was
filling
for
me
d
this
beer
isnt
as
heavy
as
you
would
expect
and
with
an
abv
of
6
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
rogue
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
what
a
great
stout
notes
i
dont
often
review
a
beer
twice
simply
because
i
had
it
via
a
different
delivery
e
g
bottle
vs
ontap
but
the
experience
on
the
nitrotap
was
significantly
different
and
so
i
made
an
exception
in
this
case
viewing
my
bottle
review
i
see
that
i
felt
the
nitro
tap
added
to
the
experience
resulting
in
some
bumpedup
scores
for
this
one
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
tried
great
balance
and
drinkability
and
terrific
flavor
d
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
not
exorbitant
in
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
as
i
finished
a
22
and
i
feel
fine
i
will
have
to
compare
all
other
stouts
versus
this
one
now
overall
a
really
enjoyable
brew
i
was
very
pleased
on
cask
at
elmer
sudds
arrived
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
and
appears
just
about
pitch
black
with
a
good
inch
of
creamy
dark
ecru
foam
the
foam
stays
with
me
till
the
glass
is
empty
leaving
a
sticky
lace
in
its
wake
awesome
looking
pour
smells
and
tastes
of
rich
roasted
grains
coffee
beans
both
milk
and
bitter
chocolate
molasses
bitter
somewhat
citrusy
hops
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
creamy
and
ample
carbonation
smooth
drinking
and
satisfying
this
one
earns
the
word
stout
in
its
namesake
it
is
in
fact
the
very
definition
of
the
word
you
should
see
a
picture
of
this
bottle
when
you
look
the
word
up
in
the
dictionary
this
set
the
benchmark
ive
had
many
a
great
stouts
since
i
first
tried
shakespeare
stout
but
i
still
consider
this
one
of
my
favourite
of
them
all
a
stout
by
any
other
name
is
not
as
sweet
on
the
palate
this
ale
is
big
and
roasty
full
flavored
with
ample
hops
to
stand
up
to
the
roasty
flavors
finishes
bitter
but
bitter
in
a
good
way
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
not
a
session
beer
though
d
very
high
this
beer
is
delicious
and
highly
recommended
its
a
great
stout
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
larger
stouts
and
would
prefer
a
more
toned
down
balanced
and
delicious
stout
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
yeti
as
my
favorite
american
stout
dark
brown
or
light
black
in
color
with
moderate
prickle
so
that
the
beer
resembles
cola
in
the
glass
very
light
head
and
a
malty
nose
with
hints
of
chocolate
roasted
into
the
flavor
and
texture
fresh
and
light
attack
with
the
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
towards
the
front
end
and
the
bitter
towards
the
finish
the
finish
is
pretty
crisp
and
leaves
a
little
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
d
a
pretty
good
stout
maybe
a
touch
too
roasty
to
make
it
great
but
something
i
would
drink
again
in
a
heartbeat
there
is
a
lot
to
admire
about
this
brew
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
personal
preference
i
like
my
stouts
a
little
smoother
and
sweeter
i
detect
perhaps
some
overroasting
has
taken
place
in
the
barley
nearly
a
burnt
taste
a
little
too
much
cascade
hops
for
the
style
might
have
pushed
this
out
of
my
taste
preference
i
really
like
some
rouge
beers
but
something
feels
a
little
wrong
about
this
one
due
to
the
deliciosity
of
this
artwork
of
a
stout
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
i
mean
that
in
every
possible
sense
poured
as
a
dark
black
ale
with
lots
of
sticky
chocolate
tinged
head
head
has
duration
and
left
plenty
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
coffees
taste
is
of
a
full
rich
bittersweet
chocolate
accompanied
by
distinct
coffee
been
flavor
leaves
a
coffee
like
aftertaste
for
a
few
minutes
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
tried
overall
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
cheers
highly
drinkable
had
a
very
smooth
finish
fairly
drinkable
but
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
sweetness
and
balance
out
of
bomber
this
beer
was
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
the
retention
was
very
good
and
the
lacing
very
good
too
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
coffee
toasted
malt
hints
of
smoke
and
welldefined
chocolate
the
flavors
were
also
very
good
dominated
by
roasted
malt
and
smoky
elements
i
also
tasted
roasted
coffee
beans
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
dry
long
coffee
finish
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
beers
of
this
style
but
complex
balanced
and
totally
onpoint
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
mediumlow
a
classic
for
a
good
reason
drinkability
is
good
some
might
not
to
be
able
too
handle
drinking
to
much
of
the
stouts
but
not
this
one
it
is
easy
to
go
down
and
stays
down
smooth
overall
a
good
stout
comparable
in
style
to
storm
king
but
not
quite
at
that
level
imo
would
not
mind
drinking
again
d
a
good
stout
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
but
misses
due
to
the
massive
hoppiness
i
like
most
of
rogues
ales
but
love
very
few
of
them
extremely
high
probably
the
most
smoothest
stout
ive
ever
drank
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
brew
d
for
an
oatmeal
stout
its
surprisingly
drinkable
i
think
the
bitterhops
flavors
offset
the
extreme
malt
and
balance
it
well
pours
blacker
than
the
blackest
night
with
a
great
creamy
brown
head
smells
of
toffee
and
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
very
similar
although
it
tends
to
be
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
not
quite
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
but
it
still
goes
down
fairly
smooth
the
only
reason
i
knocked
down
the
drinkability
score
is
that
it
might
be
overly
bitter
for
the
flavors
that
it
imparts
in
the
beginning
but
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
glass
came
filled
with
this
dark
perhaps
light
absorbing
beer
that
had
a
creamy
dark
brown
head
that
didnt
surrender
until
the
end
several
sniffs
detected
some
toffee
notes
several
gulps
detected
toffee
and
mocha
flavors
it
was
super
smooth
an
8
5
out
of
10
for
smoothness
the
taste
lingered
for
a
bit
and
was
very
appreciated
i
will
definately
have
this
one
again
sometime
d
a
bomber
is
a
great
portion
for
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
as
a
dessert
beer
ill
definitely
recommend
this
goody
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stoutthick
but
not
overpowering
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
on
tap
one
requiring
repeated
sessions
looking
forward
to
consuming
it
in
a
bottle
again
to
see
if
there
is
a
considerable
difference
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
stout
i
wasnt
blown
away
or
disappointed
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
eric
d
very
drinkable
although
i
wish
it
was
less
dry
in
the
finish
pitch
black
with
a
thick
head
caramel
colored
some
lacing
around
the
sides
smell
is
all
coffee
and
chocolate
espresso
with
some
bitterness
in
the
nose
taste
is
rather
bitter
bitter
burnt
coffee
taste
some
sweetness
towards
the
end
but
then
back
to
an
abrasive
bitterness
beer
seems
quite
raw
with
the
flavors
not
really
blending
together
smoothly
but
rather
each
one
is
a
separate
entity
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
some
chewiness
body
is
nice
taste
is
roasty
with
a
some
dark
chocolate
i
am
detecting
a
little
chawkiness
but
not
bad
enough
to
bother
me
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
a
stout
being
medium
with
a
little
creaminess
great
stout
that
will
be
had
again
very
little
carbonation
quite
smooth
overall
it
probably
is
my
favorite
stout
im
looking
forward
to
another
one
overall
a
great
beer
really
really
enjoyed
this
one
delightfully
smooth
and
easydrinking
this
is
a
superb
stout
and
a
wonderful
quaff
superb
man
i
could
drink
this
all
night
less
abv
than
a
bigger
ris
cousin
makes
this
one
drinkable
on
a
high
level
for
me
full
taste
not
overpowering
but
delightful
absolutely
top
notch
stout
good
drinkability
not
too
rich
or
high
abv
lets
this
one
be
a
good
choice
all
night
long
while
not
exceptional
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
rogue
d
a
great
beer
which
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
has
some
interesting
differences
from
other
stouts
that
really
sets
it
apart
i
was
expecting
much
more
hop
flavor
and
while
there
is
a
good
amount
with
those
citrusy
flavors
i
didnt
think
it
was
overdone
delicious
poured
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
pitch
black
and
pours
with
a
large
milk
chocolate
colored
head
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fantastic
its
nice
and
strong
as
well
with
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
it
has
a
smokey
aroma
too
with
a
small
amount
of
floral
hops
the
taste
has
more
coffeeness
to
it
than
the
smell
but
it
is
not
overbearing
the
bitterness
comes
through
a
second
after
each
sip
but
its
only
strong
enough
to
notice
it
quite
a
drinkable
beer
at
its
low
alcohol
content
and
im
a
bit
sad
that
i
didnt
pick
up
another
bomber
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
probably
the
best
stout
ive
had
this
was
a
very
very
easy
bomber
to
put
away
and
look
for
another
it
is
a
real
treat
and
could
become
a
habitual
purchase
when
available
i
know
it
is
year
round
but
i
dont
see
it
year
round
out
here
buy
it
when
you
see
it
d
moderate
abv
and
well
crafted
flavors
make
this
an
easy
accessible
favorite
poured
into
a
pint
glass
out
of
22oz
bomber
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
nice
dark
tan
almost
brownish
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
bit
and
then
fades
to
a
nice
foam
ring
its
completely
opaque
when
held
up
to
the
light
although
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
i
find
this
to
be
a
rather
complex
beer
in
the
nose
there
is
a
lot
of
coffee
or
almost
even
a
cappucino
smell
and
a
huge
roasted
malt
presence
nice
and
earthy
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
in
the
taste
you
get
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
nice
bitter
chocolate
finish
a
decent
creamy
taste
in
the
end
as
well
similar
to
an
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
lace
on
the
glass
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
very
easy
drinking
but
packed
with
tons
of
complex
flavors
if
you
can
find
it
get
it
for
sure
poured
an
opaque
cola

than
two
fingers

head
looks
nice
smell
is
malty
with
roasty
grain
and
coffee
and
nut
notes
fairly
subtle
as
i
sip
i
get
more
of
the
barley
flavors
from
the
nose
and
some
bitter
chocolate
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
id
have
liked
however
i
find
i
really
enjoy
the
drinkability
here
at
just
6
this
goes
down
easily
a
nice
relatively
simple
stout
that
i
appreciate
even
if
i
dont
adore
it
first
thing
i
notice
is
not
the
flavor
but
the
awesome
chewy
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
totally
fills
your
mouth
remarkable
taste
is
great
leaves
a
ton
of
roastiness
and
coffee
on
the
palate
not
sweet
but
pretty
dry
and
bitter
quite
simply
delicious
and
not
over
the
top
subtle
carbonation
just
right
i
now
understand
the
revered
cult
status
of
the
shakespeare
stout
it
is
a
mouthful
but
it
is
frothy
and
delicious
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
of
these
drinkability
goes
down
quite
easily
for
a
stout
id
like
to
try
this

off
tasting
thin

lacking

delicious
the

appreciated
too
very
good

all
in

a
very

the
finish
is
the
only
thing
that
really
gets
me
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
but
very
refreshing
bubbly
and
fizzy
from
the
carbonation
creamy
as
well
but
it
suffers
a
little
because
its
a
tinge
watery
drinkability
is
great
its
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
finish
is
a
little

mixed
with
coffee
and
chocolate
very
nice
great
stout
from
rogue
one
for
my
favorite
beers
from
the
beginning
of
my
beer
exploration
it
was
nice
to
revisit
it
after
a
while
and
find
that
it
is
essentially
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
this
has
good
drinkability
cause
its
not
a
heavy
stout
i
would
consider
doing
a
session
with
this

drinkability

the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
easy

smooth

quite
delicious
an
excellent
beer
at
any
time
before
dinner
during
or
for

its
interesting
that
shakespeare
stout
the
beer
i
noted
to
myself
last
week
that
i
most
wanted
to
sample
from
rogue
was
the
same
beer
that
both
precipitated
my
grabbing
a
few
others
from
this
terrific
northwest
brewery
and
the
one
that
i
sampled
last
shakespeare
stout
certainly
embodies
the
adage
last
but
not
least
for
it
is
an
outstanding
stout
im
amazed
that
i
had
yet
to
try
this
sterling
some
cocoa
taste
dark
chocolate
as
it
is
oatmeal
sour
and
dough
there
is
a
rather
small
amount
of
coffee
and
other
subtle
aspects
to
the
flavor
its
a
great
stout
in
a
category
crowded
by
only
good
to
average
examples

quite
frankly
this

almost
identical

their
mocha
porter

i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
this
further
blurs
the
line
between
porter
and
stout
in
my
opinion
it
seems
like
its
really
at
the
brewers
discretion
whether
they
call
their

a

porter
im
not

this

the

caramel

everything
that
i
like
in
a
stout
this
beer
has
a
great
roasted
flavor
there
is
also
a
malty
caramel
flavor
the
most
notable
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
hops
there
is
much
more
hopiness
than
in
most
stouts
the
hops
and
bitter
roastiness
balance
the

mouthfeel
is

this
beer
is
terrific
both
from

and

just
be

let
it
warm
up
if
its
at

of

oh
yes
i
love
this
beer
buy
a
few
but
its
a
good
stout
drinkability
this
definitely
isnt
a
session
beer
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
one
bomber
of
shakespeare
is
the
perfect
way
to
end
an
evening
really
an
amazing
beer
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
this
was
my
second
bottle
and
ive
got
a
third
waiting
for
me
this
guy
is
pretty
drinkable
as
well
a
sipper
but
drinkable
very
tasty
concoction
go
get
one
tasty
drink
im
a
bigger
fan
of
some
of
the
other
rouge
offerings
but
this
is
definetly
a
winner
intensely
creamy
with
a
dry
taste
to
it
coffee
flavors
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
mostly

very

and
an
easily
quaffable
masterpiece
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
to
drink
and
one
i
will
drink
lots
and
lots
of
excellent
this
is
a
stout
worth
seeking
out
from
the
milkshake
like
head
through
the
bottom
of
the
pint
every
sip
was
a
treat
it
was
as
luxurious
as
a
fine
chocolate
mousse
i
split
this
bottle
with
my
brother
but
wish
id
drank
it
all
myself

a
lushious
offbrown
twofinger
head
over
a
stark
black
liquid
smells
of
chops
chocolate
roast
and
alcohol
my
first
taste
was
of
smoked
malt
and
chocolate
in
later
tastes
the
smoke
disappeared
and
the
chocolate
resolved
into
that
of
chocolate
easter
bunny
ears
i
never
thought
id
say
that
about
a
beer
but
the
flavor
really
is
a
gentle
melt
in
your
mouth
a
hop
bitter
is
present
early
and
persists
through
the
swallow
becoming
a
bit
stronger
in
the
immediate
aftertaste
the
bitter
is
accompanied
by
a
citrusy
hop
flavor
that
is
noticable
not
overbearing
and
in
balance
with
the
other
flavors
it
has
a
lactose
creaminess
that
works
well
with
what
i
perceive
as
medium
body
the
mild
carbonation
leaves
only
a
gentle
acrid
thats
actually
below
the
hop
bitter
and
gentle
roast
flavors
not
so
roasty
as
to
be
coffeelike
but
detectable
with
searching
cherry
sour
which
is
a
feature
found
in
many
stouts
is
either
nonexistant
or
hidden
beneath
the
hop
bitter
in
the
end
near
the
end
of
the
glass
and
the
beer
is
leaving
a
dry
hopbitter
and
cocoa
powder
on
my
tongue
not
entirely
pleasing
from
a
drinkablility
standpoint
theres
still
a

bless
you
rogue
ales
for
creating
this
fantastic
brew
shakespeare
stout
is
hard

im
quite
glad
to
have
had
the
experience
of
drinking
it
drinkability
with
the
lower
abv
and
the
great
taste
make
for
a

combination
its
good

highly

this

rogue
impresses
once
again
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
i
have
had
to
date
this
one
will
be
purchased
again
in
the
future
this
one
could
be
the
best
of
my
favorite
style
highly
recommended
although
due
to
price
concerns
ill
likely
stick
with
obsidian
for
now
overall
this
is
the
beer
that
guinness
extra
stout
only
wishes
it
could
be
a
very
nice
and
complex
example
of
an
american
stout
and
one
that
i
wish
i
could
buy
locally
ive
got
one
more
in
the
closet
and
ill
be
hoarding
it
for
a

occasion
for

i

the
next

i
see
this
one
ontap
im
ordering
one
just
to
see
how
the
co2
effects
the
brew
a
pour
from
a
bomber
produces
a
thick
and
frothy
head
beautiful
brown
and
chocolaty
a
rich
looking
dark
beer
with
a
dense
mouthfeel
but
not
heavy
nothing
like
those
watery
nitroinfused
stouts
an
aroma
of
burnt
malt
comes
to
you
then
a
full
taste
with
slight
roasted
notes
and
chocolate
aftertaste
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
great
stout
and
my
favorite
offering
from
rogue
try
it
dn
dangerously
drinkable
im
totally
in
love
with
cask
conditioned
dark
beers
now
if
you
see
this
one
on
cask
drop
everything
and
go
have
a
pint
you
wont
regret
it

drink

iii
iv
if
you
look
at
this
beer
as
comfort
food
youll
find
that
too
much
of
anything
albeit
tasty
might
not
be
exactly
what
you
needed
drinkability
cant
give
it
a
5
but
i
sure
wish
i
had
another
bomber
of
this
very
dark
basically
black
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
brown
highlights
this
was
topped
by
a
dense
dark
brown
head
that
showed
excellent
retention
the
aroma
was
quite
malty
with
some
lightly
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
just
slightly
burnt
sweetness
and
fresh
floral
hops
serve
as
a
decent
counterpoint
the
flavour
is
really
big
but
balanced
nicely
between
bitterness
and
rich
malts
chocolate
and
lactoselike
sweetness
counter
the
definite
burnt
malts
bitterness
is
on
the
strong
side
with
plenty
of
floral
and
orangecitrus
hoppiness
it
had
a
long
finish
that
emphasized
bitterness
and
roasted
malts
leaving
the
palate
on
the
dry
side
the
texture
was
velvety
smooth
low
carbonation
composed
of
fine
bubbles
and
a
full
body
this
is
great
stuff
nice
balance
with
plenty
of
flavour
and
a
great
finish
hard
to
find
anything
bad
about
this
beer
pours
black
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
did
not
leave
much
lacing
but
was
wellretained
chocolatey
coffee
aroma
and
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
you
can
also
really
notice
the
roasted
malts
and
a
good
amount
of
hoppage
as
well
great
silky
creamy
mouthfeel
really
coats
the
inside
of
your
mouth
nicely
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
as
well
at
5
for
a
22
oz
bomber
you
wont
see
me
drinking
this
every
night
but
definitely
a
great
beer
and
a
great
representation
of
its
style
as
well
the
beer
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
no
light
penetration
and
a
large
tan
colored
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
another
beauty
from
rogue
the
aroma
is
a
complex
blend
of
coffee
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
maybe
dark
currants
incredible
smell
the
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
blackstrap
molasses
taste
followed
by
a
dark
currant
fruity
taste
as
well
as
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
then
you
get
a
nice
roasted
coffee
flavor
and
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dry
roasted
hoppy
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
which
contrasts
with
the
bitter
finish
of
the
beer
quite
nicely
overall
an
exceptional
stout
not
the
most
drinkable
but
complex
and
extremely
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
american
stouts
definitely
one
i
must
make
chili
with
taste
is
an
interesting
case
its
not
overly
sweet
but
there
is
a
definite
dark
chocolate
flavor
on
top
of
a
roasted
malt
note
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
nice
hop
presence
offsetting
some
of
the
roastiness
the
alcohol
is
just
barely
there
but
youll
notice
it
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
thin
and
watery
for
me
its
a
delicious
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
a
while
poured
smooth
and
creamy
pronounced
coffeeroasted
aroma
taste
was
like
a
rich
espresso
with
bits
of
bitter
chocolate
finished
with
a
nice
hop
flavour
this
is
a
rich
and
creamy
stout
that
will
leave
you
wanting
more
well
crafted
and
worth
every
bit
of
hype
it
gets
well
done
pours
opaque
black
from
a
22oz
bomber
and
generates
a
generous
helping
of
frothy
brown
head
nice
powerful
aroma
of
chocolate
and
smooth
malt
some
coffee
and
roasted
notes
as
well
as
a
little
caramel
flavor
is
large
but
remarkably
smooth
hints
of
black
malt
nip
at
the
tongue
while
big
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
smooth
things
over
the
big
malts
eventually
allow
room
for
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
finish
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
hops
roasted
grain
and
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
but
nothing
terrible
the
hop
presence
makes
for
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
american
stout
pours
black
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
with
good
retention
malty
nutty
nose
with
some
roastedness
absolutely
perfectly
balanced
nutty
flavour
with
the
roasted
the
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
im
reviewing
this
from
notes
and
i
can
still
imagine
the
taste
in
my
mouth
lovely
stuff
to
quote
my
good
friend
who
was
with
me
that
night
i
think
i
might
have
sex
with
this
beer
wow
this
is
damn
tasty
unfortunately
in
ontario
it
is
also
damn
expensive
this
is
the
real
deal
bow
down
to
the
mofo
king
o
the
stouts
the
taste
is
definitely
distinct
no
sweetness
mostly
an
assault
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
you
can
taste
the
nut
and
it
ends
with
a
dry
bitter
taste
very
overwhelming
all
over
i
really
have
to
judge
this
beer
by
style
and
not
personal
preference
but
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
kickyouintheballs
stout
this
is
definitely
for
you
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
opaque
no
light
is
getting
through
this
bastard
smells
of
nice
charred
malts
with
a
dollop
of
cascade
hoppiness
taste
on
this
one
is
dry
burnt
and
chocolately
malts
backed
up
by
a
citric
cascade
hoppines
very
neutral
yeast
finishes
off
this
puppy
very
bitter
and
dry
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
to
boot
this
is
how
a
stout
should
look
smell
and
taste
damn
near
perfection
in
a
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
full
creamy
smooth
and
not
too
carbonated
this
is
an
outstanding
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
another
great
one
from
rogue
pours
blacker
than
night
and
has
a
chocolaty
tan
head
that
stays
until
the
beer
is
gone
this
beer
is
so
good
it
almost
makes
me
speechless
i
have
waited
too
long
to
try
this
wonderful
beer
it
is
smooth
and
velvety
in
all
aspects
and
is
for
sure
the
king
of
american
stouts
i
am
in
love
this
stuff
poured
just
beautifully
dark
brown
as
it
poured
into
the
glass
filling
it
jet
black
like
ink
finger
thick
head
which
dissipated
quickly
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
much
hoppier
than
i
was
anticipating
i
dont
really
care
for
hops
of
this
magnitude
but
its
other
attributes
make
up
for
its
hoppiness
the
taste
has
a
little
less
hops
than
the
smell
does
which
is
very
good
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
malt
present
here
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
has
its
good
and
bad
points
to
me
wonderful
appearance
and
extremley
smooth
but
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
which
i
do
not
care
for
overall
though
this
is
quite
tasty
i
am
not
really
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
this
one
is
actually
quite
phenomenal
the
appearance
is
pitch
black
with
an
huge
tan
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
frilly
little
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
earthy
like
chocolatey
roasted
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
almost
exactly
like
rogues
chocolate
stout
in
other
words
chocolatey
ever
so
slightly
roasted
malt
the
bottle
boasts
that
this
beer
is
consistently
rated
as
americas
finest
stout
i
for
one
cannot
disagree
but
i
would
welcome
anybody
to
buy
me
a
stout
of
any
other
make
if
they
thought
it
could
be
beaten
either
opinion
would
be
highly
subjective
but
nonetheless
i
doubt
anybody
could
argue
that
this
is
not
a
very
fine
stout
additional
note
this
beer
doesnt
reach
its
true
potential
until
it
has
been
cured
for
at
least
18
months
like
sitting
in
the
back
of
your
fridge
type
cured
preferably
for
two
years
if
you
dont
wait
this
long
or
if
you
dont
find
a
bottle
that
is
that
old
you
will
have
what
i
refer
to
as
a
green
beer
believe
me
when
i
say
this
beer
will
taste
primarily
like
grapefruit
peel
and
not
much
more
if
it
hasnt
been
aged
for
that
long
shakespeare
stout
isnt
for
everyone
and
certainly
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
wow
great
i
cant
believe
i
have
not
tried
this
until
now
picked
up
a
bomber
the
other
day
poured
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
twofinger
deep
chocolate
brown
head
the
nose
came
across
as
very
smoky
the
flavor
was
malts
more
smoke
burnt
chocolate
and
with
a
very
subtle
but
pleasant
hoppy
bitter
bite
what
does
it
for
me
is
the
mouthfeel
very
bold
and
full
does
not
hold
abck
and
tease
but
smacks
you
right
in
the
teeth
very
easy
to
drink
and
hard
to
put
down
if
it
were
not
for
th
damn
snowstorm
outside
i
would
go
buy
some
more
pours
as
black
as
black
can
be
cant
see
through
it
even
when
held
up
to
a
light
very
small
brown
head
that
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
lace
around
the
glass
smells
thick
and
robust
aromas
of
beautiful
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
some
hop
aromas
and
faint
smells
of
alcohol
but
the
wonderful
character
of
the
roasted
malt
makes
you
quickly
forget
about
it
taste
is
very
wonderful
a
wonderful
taste
of
of
a
beautiful
roasted
malt
that
contains
all
the
flavors
that
it
should
coffee
chocolate
and
a
nice
roasted
bitterness
as
stouts
go
everything
here
is
just
balanced
wonderfully
leaves
a
nice
coffee
like
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
slight
warming
feeling
going
down
a
bit
too
thick
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
that
is
the
intent
one
this
one
just
enjoy
unusually
for
a
stout
i
feel
that
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
although
i
doubt
i
would
want
to
one
is
enough
a
very
pleasant
stout
but
more
of
curiosity
than
a
session
beer
for
me
tastes
as
it
smells
with
more
bitterness
no
real
taste
of
alcohol
the
after
taste
is
rich
and
chocolaty
with
something
that
reminds
me
of
hard
pretzels
it
feels
a
little
less
thick
than
one
would
think
baised
on
the
colors
its
smooth
and
is
something
i
enjoy
sitting
and
drinking
pint
after
pint
of
an
excellent
stout
and
one
of
my
favorites
inky
black
color
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
drapes
on
the
glass
later
as
a
lace
the
nose
is
roasted
dark
malt
with
chocolate
overtones
mild
coffee
and
subtle
cherry
hops
come
across
late
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
more
cherry
than
i
detected
in
the
nose
chocolate
covered
cherries
is
the
1st
impression
i
get
the
roasted
malt
and
coffee
character
takes
over
from
there
with
the
hops
layered
in
the
finish
showing
as
a
tangy
floral
character
the
mouth
feel
is
a
velvet
smooth
character
ive
really
come
to
love
from
fine
stouts
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
representation
of
the
style
very
drinkable
imo
i
will
never
forget
last
night
when
i
tried
this
one
out
at
the
town
pump
bar
in
black
mountain
nc
my
drunk
coworker
bought
this
for
a
female
friend
who
wanted
a
bud
light
she
handed
this
off
to
me
when
i
left
for
the
bathroom
i
came
back
to
find
out
the
guy
poured
half
the
pint
glass
into
his
after
enjoying
my
half
which
was
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
experience
the
guy
fell
into
the
bands
music
stands
and
upright
bass
the
owner
and
bassist
almost
kicked
his
ass
as
he
continued
to
argue
with
everyone
we
all
got
kicked
out
but
at
least
the
owner
told
me
i
could
come
back
after
i
paid
with
the
guys
credit
card
and
left
him
a
fat
tip
memories
thinking
about
it
makes
my
mouth
water
i
think
ill
have
another
drinkability
certainly
drinkable
but
my
bottle
doesnt
merit
the
accolades
others
have
given
this
brew
mouth
feel
is
pretty
smooth
which
is
to
be
expected
from
a
stout
caramel
undertones
coupled
with
oaty
goodness
this
is
a
well
made
brew
slight
alcohol
tinge
followed
by
a
very
subtle
chocolate
tone
overall
a
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
stout
cheers
dark
chocolate
silk
with
just
enough
complexity
to
always
be
interesting
yet
not
so
intense
so
as
to
lose
drinkability
this
is
the
session
stout
aroma
is
chocolatecovered
black
raspberries
the
roastedness
is
strong
but
melds
seamlessly
with
the
other
flavors
of
caramel
and
hops
yes
the
hops
are
there
just
like
we
expect
from
rogue
but
they
are
not
overly
fruity
their
flavor
adds
earthiness
and
life
to
the
aroma
and
a
vinous
depth
to
the
flavor
body
is
mediumthin
but
the
low
carbonation
stops
it
from
feeling
at
all
fizzy
lingering
bitterness
and
roasted
acidity
tantalize
the
taste
buds
for
another
sip
oh
yeah
this
is
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
big
and
chewy
carbonation
could
be
a
little
less
aggressive
but
10
minutes
in
the
glass
and
its
perfect
quite
silky
and
velvety
creamy
malts
and
pine
drenched
hops
fight
it
out
for
the
finish
as
always
one
of
rogues
best
and
its
even
better
on
draft
tastes
great
smells
great
and
a
joy
to
look
at
i
will
buy
this
again
and
again
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
one
and
all
the
hype
was
right
amazing
brew
appears
a
dark
dark
dark
brown
not
quite
black
with
a
little
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
out
smells
roasty
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
thrown
in
burning
tar
sort
of
thats
a
good
thing
by
the
way
this
is
the
hoppiest
stout
ive
ever
had
for
sure
not
to
say
that
it
isnt
malty
because
it
definately
is
roasted
toasted
malts
galore
espresso
bean
flavor
not
too
sweet
just
how
i
like
it
and
the
best
thing
is
it
has
a
super
bitter
hoppy
kick
to
it
in
the
end
and
a
very
dry
finish
i
dont
think
ive
really
experienced
that
in
a
stout
before
leave
it
to
rogue
bunch
of
inovators
d
very
average
i
doubt
i
will
buy
this
again
drinkability
and
overall
classic
stout
everything
you
want
and
need
in
a
stout
is
available
in
this
beer
strong
yet
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
best
rogue
has
once
again
outdone
themselves
drinkability
like
a
fine
port
or
steak
this
is
not
something
id
drink
every
day
its
just
too
fine
and
rich
a
brew
this
is
what
stout
should
be
i
cant
imagine
why
i
waited
as
long
as
i
did
trying
it
comments
if
you
have
friends
that
dont
like
dark
beers
get
them
to
try
this
one
the
flavor
is
complex
but
it
is
mostly
subdued
due
to
the
nice
additions
of
oats
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
chocolatey
with
just
enough
bitterness
that
makes
this
brew
perfectly
balanced
im
not
sure
if
stouts
get
much
better
than
this

that

then
the

takes
control
and
impart
a

a

this

is

am
not
a
big
fan
of
stouts
that
have
a
very
heavy
coffee
taste
to
them
however
bold
mouthful
gives
way
to
exquisite
bitter
chocolate
and
espresso
flavors
because
this
has
some
lovely
malts
spice
and
a
light
metallic
tang
to
it
a
slight
camphor
essence
can
be
detected
as
can
the
fairly
strong
alcohol
kick
this
unfiltered
but
remains
as
a
slight
ring
around
the
glass
it
has
a
mild
citrusy
hop
aroma
cascade
hops
with
dark
malt
character
that
blends
together
nicely
the

second
perfect
5
in
100
reviews
i
couldnt
find
anything
wrong
with
it
period
what
a
way
to
enter
the
mug
club
and
i
was
saving
it
for
that
cheers
palate
is
out
of
balance
for
this
taster
too
much
hop
flavor
not
too
much
bitterness
but
it
tastes
almost
like
a
hop
tea
rather
than
a
beer
there
is
some
nice
malt
coffee
and
bitter
notes
but
they
are
simply
overwhelmed
by
the
cascade
flavor
definitely
a
quality
brew
but
not
to
my
taste
this
is
a
thick
black
beer
with
a
dense
creamy
tan
head
great
roasted
grain
and
hop
aroma
drinking
sensation
is
full
and
heavy
and
the
taste
is
intriguingly
bitter
coffee
caramel
and
roastedburnt
grains
the
bitter
finish
is
simply
outstanding
i
keep
thinking
that
this
is
what
other
stouts
aspire
to
be
when
they
grow
up
in
my
opinion
no
other
stout
in
the
world
compares
as
far
as
i
have
tasted
this
is
the
best
stout
i
have
tasted
bar
none
get
some
now
black
nearly
opaque
with
an
impressive
dark
tan
foam
topping
it
this
settles
but
stays

and
leaves

dark
chocolate
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
fruity
hop
character
mixed
in
great
malthop

in
the
taste
chocolate
in
the
front
and
citrus
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
roastedcoffee
character
in
between
fantastic
mouthfeel
probably
the
smoothest
stout
ive
tried
great
complexity
close
to
fullbodied
but
you
could
say
its
mediumfull
bodied
just
a
wonderful
taste
from
start
to
finish
exceptionally
drinkable
i
can
see
this
being
a
regular
favorite
of
mine
what
a
great
beer
it
was
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
after
the
initial
surprise
i
just
sat
back
and
enjoyed
it
strong
chocolate
aroma
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
but
beautifully
dark
brown
head
this
is
definitely
on
my
buy
again
list
this
beer
pours
a
very
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
the
head
doesnt
stay
as
long
as
expected
there
are
slight
smells
of
coffee
beans
and
chocolate
on
the
first
sip
upon
first
taste
one
notices
spice
and
malt
and
a
hint
of
coffee
and
clove
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
stout
not
quite
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
liked
but
very
good
as
far
as
stouts
go
i
would
definately
reccomend
this
beer
to
my
friends
great
opaque
brown
color
the
head
is
colored
too
only
it
doesnt
stick
to
the
glass
has
large
bubbles
and
disappears
quickly
the
aromas
are
of
candied
darkroast
coffee
beans
peat
and
carob
the
taste
is
straightforward
mildly
sweet
and
infused
with
sweet
spices
coffee
potatoes
and
charred
radicchio
the
finish
is
pleasantly
dry
and
lingers
just
long
enough
to
seem
relevant
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
can
someone
fill
me
in
on
the
shakespeare
connection
is
this
what
he
drank
i
thought
he
was
more
of
an

smooth

are

beer
and
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
it
is
definitely
very
deserving
of
its
spot
on
the
top
beers
this
stout
looks
as
delicious
as
it
tastes

retained
its
fine
froth

entire
time
i

slight

aroma
burnt

nose
leading
to
a
very

sweetness
at
the

of

nice

mouthfeel
probably
due
to
the
oats
maybe
a
hair
too
much
carbonation
in
my
22oz

finish
is
quick
and
hoppy
aftertaste
deliciously
roasty
and
bitter
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
nice
and
dry
but
not
thin
fabulous
stout
too
dry
for
me
personally
however
this
was
exceptional
opaque
black
and
beautiful
with
a
thin
brown
head
the
lack
of
head
retention
is
the
only
thing
that
kept
it
from
a
five
in
appearance
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
was
coffeeroasted
malt
which
lasted
forever
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamyalmost
satin
on
the
tongue
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
out
there
my
second

stout
as
of
this
tasting
inky
dark
in
color
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
with
a
malty
after
taste
has
a
little
bitter
tang
on

but
a
pleasant
bitter
after
taste
one
to
keep
in

stock
ive
just
returned
from

where
i
had
the
shakespeare
stout
ok
well
two
of
them
along
with
dinner
very
tasty
with
a
very
agreeable
finish
though
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
this
is
a
minor
quibble
though
as
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
esp
in
the
big
bottles
absolutely
seek
and
enjoy
this
brew
you
are
doing
an
injustice
otherwise
the
best
stout
viva
rogue
cheers
this
heavy
stout
has
a
sticky
heavy
dark
tan
head
and
a
very
dark
color
heavy
malt
aroma
gives
hints
of
the
thick
heavy
body
this
is
one
of
the
most
bitter
stouts
out
there
nice
roasted
flavor
with
chocolate
undertones
not
the
best
but
not
bad
well
not
much
i
can
say
that
hasnt
already
been
stated
i
thought
this
was
great
jet
black
color
very
thick
is
it
going
to
make
it
out
of
the
bottle
nice
thick
tan
head
little
oily
drops
dancing
on
top
smell
was
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
i
really
noticed
the
roasted
fruit
and
malt
tasted
better
than
it
smelled
very
even
taste
sweet
the
fruit
malt
and
touch
of
hops
as
well
very
good
mesermerizing
beer
i
just
looked
at
it
and
wondered
how
it
could
taste
so
good
this
also
at
the
top
of
my
list
i
have
only
1
left
of
6
bummer
deep
opaque
color
dark
as
night
deep
tan
head
with
loose
carbonation
big
chocolate
nose
flavor
is
part
creamy
part
bitter
but
with
an
incredible
lightness
for
such
a
flavorful
beer
140
whatever
please
sir
may
i
have
another
get
thee
to
the
brewery
man
this
is
an
awesome
stout
pours
out
motor
oil
black
darkest
beer
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
the
head
was
light
brown
not
massive
but
ample
and
smells
of
roasted
malt
then
comes
a
complete
flavor
explosion
upon
entering
the
mouth
we
got
sweet
chocolate
coffee
a
sort
of
charcoal
and
earthy
flavors
all
combining
for
make
one
of
the
most
complex
stouts
ive
had
it
went
down
smooth
easy
like
the
good
stuff
it
is
i
was
going
to
have
dinner
with
this
but
ended
up
being
dinner
itself
it
finished
off
with
a
almost
undecernable
bitterness
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
i
highly
recommend
it
very
nice
dark
cannot
see
light
through
it
good
sign
nice
malty
and
slight
mint
on
the
nose
deep
mocha
malt
in
your
mouthwith
a
medium
dry
finish
its
black
and
beautiful
many
flavors
are
bouncing
off
each
other
chocolate
coffee
and
others
i
havent
yet
been
able
to
put
my
finger
on
however
it
wasnt
quite
as
chunky
as
i
expected
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
draught
this
may
well
be
the
best
stout
ive
ever
tasted
it
was
as
black
as
a
starless
midnight
with
a
thick
creamy
brown
head
interesting
and
damn
fine
aroma
of
roasted
barley
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
nice
thick
rich
stout
with
an
incredible
flavor
midnight
black
with
one
of
the
darkest
heads
ever
deep
auburn
with
those
even
darker
last
drips
from
the
pour
really
great
lace
as
well
intricate
crownofthorns
patterns
sweet
smell
some
whiffs
of
dehydrated
concentrated
strawberry
darnnear
perfect
mouthfeel
heavy
and
rich
but
not
at
all
syrupy
chocolate
flavors
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
berry
in
a
very
consistent
statement
solid
roast
and
an
impressive
and
distinguishing
hop
bite
to
the
back
flavor
this
is
a
dang
outstanding
stout
just
first
rate
in
all
categories
man
it
is
good
this
is
as
high
as
i
think
ive
ever
rated
a
beer
wonderful
outstanding
refreshing
flavorful
i
could
go
on
and
on
this
pours
to
a
beautiful
dark
color
with
amber
hints
in
the
lace
and
foam
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
followed
by
a
nearperfect
taste
all
the
way
through
there
is
something
magical
that
happens
to
stouts
when
oats
are
added
it
becomes
a
food
an
event
a
happening
and
not
just
a
drink
yum
oh
my
gosh
this
was
a
good
beer
im
a
huge
stout
fan
to
start
with
but
this
is
a
great
stout
the
appearance
was
great
it
was
like
a
big
black
mass
topped
by
a
lightly
colored
chocolate
milkshake
the
head
was
very
creamy
especially
considering
it
wasnt
nitrous
dispensed
allergy
season
is
kicking
in
right
now
so
i
couldnt
get
much
out
of
the
smell
but
what
i
did
get
was
nice
the
taste
is
great
a
little
more
roastedburned
bitterness
than
most
of
the
other
stouts
ive
tried
but
it
was
backed
up
by
a
full
rich
flavor
combined
with
the
mouthfeel
it
tasted
like
a
drinking
a
glass
of
thin
chocolate
milk
with
a
good
bit
less
lactic
sweetness
although
i
may
have
picked
up
some
of
that
and
a
healthy
shot
of
dark
chocolate
espresso
this
beer
would
be
frightening
if
nitrous
dispensed
every
beer
that
i
had
from
rogue
was
great
they
have
so
many
great
beers
seriously
hopped
up
stout
a
strong
pour
will
give
you
a
beautiful
chocolate
milk
head
that
leaves
a
spidery
lace
roast
malt
body
finishes
clinging
dry
grapefruit
more
hop
flavor
than
your
typical
stout
makes
this
beer
a
treat
well
worth
a
taste
if
youve
only
tried
irish
stouts
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
long
lasting
aroma
long
lasting
creamy
head
and
it
also
comes
in
a
cool
650ml
bottle
if
only
my
morning
coffee
was
this
good
pours
out
black
with
a
vigorous
brown
head
which
unfortunately
died
too
quickly
hints
of
burnt
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
subdued
cascade
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
exceptional
with
bitter
malts
and
hops
balancing
out
the
profile
a
burnt
coffee
finish
with
the
hops
lingering
on
but
the
hops
arent
overwhelming
which
of
course
is
desired
in
a
stout
but
the
hops
of
course
its
a
rogue
dance
on
the
tounge
enough
to
break
up
any
creamy
slickness
that
is
usual
for
stouts
a
hophead
stout
for
sure
but
balanced
enough
to
appeal
traditional
stout
drinkers
yummy
dark
tan
head
that
is
both
creamy
and
lacy
sticks
to
the
side
of
your
glass
as
you
drink
it
massive
roasted
smell
compared
to
other
stouts
with
a
hint
of
astringency
big
roasted
barley
assault
upfront
on
the
palate
with
a
strong
hop
bitterness
and
no
hop
aroma
slight
aftertaste
of
licorice
and
bitter
chocolate
thick
mouthfeel
that
also
seems
to
fizz
on
your
tounge
slightly
this
is
a
big
bold
black
and
beautiful
stout
and
why
i
love
the
style
very
heavy
which
is
what
i
drink
a
stout
for
my
first
rogue
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
pitch
black
with
a
light
brown
foamy
head
oddly
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
what
strikes
me
is
the
carbonation
both
the
look
of
it
as
you
swirl
it
in
your
glass
and
the
feel
of
it
on
your
tongue
i
couldnt
detect
much
chocolate
in
the
taste
but
rather
a
very
dark
almost
burnt
espresso
overall
a
nice
beer
and
an
impressive
introduction
to
rogue
pitch
black
dark
tan
head
full
bodied
rich
malty
yet
bittersweet
cocoa
and
smoked
notes
like
an
oatmeal
stout
and
a
porter
in
one
very
filling
unfortunately
my
22oz
bottle
cost
4
opaque
black
appearance
faint
aroma
coffee
malt
taste
with
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
reasonably
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
pretty
good
stout
very
smooth
and
mellow
notes
this
is
a
cult
classic
american
stout
drink
and
learn
balanced
to
perfection
and
a
sheer
delite
to
drink
i
opened
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
that
i
had
been
keeping
for
a
cold
day
having
had
this
before
i
knew
what
i
was
in
for
i
love
the
bitterness
combined
with
sweetness
a
slight
burnt
flavor
gives
keeps
you
on
your
toes
it
did
not
have
much
of
a
head
so
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
but
heywhat
a
beer
exceptional
pretty
much
sums
up
this
fave
stout
of
mine
reminds
me
of
a
sierra
nevada
stout
kicked
up
a
couple
o
notches
roasty
chocolaty
chewy
i
think
you
could
stand
a
spoon
on
end
in
this
one
can
rogue
do
no
wrong
i
ask
awww
yeeah
this
is
the
good
good
stuff
full
bodied
stout
that
starts
out
with
intense
roasted
malt
and
barley
and
finishes
with
subtle
hop
bitterness
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
quaffed
this
beer
is
truly
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
a
remarkable
stout
another
big
winner
in
the
rogue
portfolio
the
beer
smells
good
but
cant
match
the
marvelous
toffee
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
that
emerge
suitable
for
both
bar
drinking
or
as
a
dessert
another
masterwork
from
rogue
not
as
sweet
as
an
english
stout
nor
as
dry
as
an
irish
a
unique
middle
ground
a
stout
loaded
with
cascade
hops
it
works
beautifully
tastes
like
bittersweet
chocolate
liquor
has
been
my
favorite
stout
for
a
while
and
probably
will
be
for
the
rest
of
my
life
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
pike
xxxxx
stout
if
you
cant
decide
between
an
ipa
and
a
stout
have
a
willy
shakes
and
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too
if
you
love
stout
you
have
to
love
this
one
the
irish
should
be
ashamed
and
turn
to
portland
oregon
to
satisfy
their
love
for
a
style
that
their
own
breweries
have
long
forgotten
how
to
make
both
the
shakespeare
and
its
seasonal
variant
wild
irish
rogue
are
stunning
examples
of
what
you
can
do
with
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
love
of
the
brewing
art
i
was
so
pumped
to
finally
drink
this
beer
and
it
was
a
total
yeast
bomb
drank
the
top
half
very
intense
roasted
black
coffee
still
kinda
pissed
zero
carbonation
not
sure
what
it
was
intended
to
taste
like
i
luckily
have
a
few
ba
versions
to
review
at
a
later
date
bourbon
tequila
cherry
wine
happy
to
have
tried
the
base
beer
fresh
excited
to
see
what
the
various
barrels
have
done
to
this
terrific
brew
dark
red
brown
color
with
1
of
tan
head
that
disappears
into
thin
lacing
and
smells
like
coffee
taste
like
big
roasted
coffee
that
finishes
with
a
heavy
bitterness
like
drinking
cold
espresso
pretty
good
stout
rich
and
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
glass
snifter
slightly
bitter
good
mouthfeel
not
too
gassy
rjt
the
development
through
different
stages
on
the
palate
without
loosing
focus
on
the
coffee
impresses
me
and
it
stays
for
such
long
time
even
the
late
uprising
bitterness
seems
to
go
well
along
with
a
remarcable
smoothness
which
gives
this
beer
a
soft
oily
appreciable
mouthfeel
chocolate
becomes
very
present
at
the
end
and
adds
a
yummy
sweet
note
to
the
overall
bitterness
this
beer
tastes
great
one
of
the
best
smelling
oatmeal
stouts
i
would
like
to
drink
same
beer
with
a
little
bit
less
coffee
taste
this
is
one
of
the
absolute
strongest
coffee
tasting
stouts
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
it
could
quite
literally
be
a
breakfast
coffee
replacer
nice
subtle
coffee
flavour
but
overly
bitter
aftertaste
for
my
liking
o
intense
bitter
flavors
from
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
make
for
a
good
flavor
profile
but
the
body
was
just
lacking
even
a
slightly
thicker
body
wouldve
helped
a
lot
overall
a
good
beer
most
probably
wont
quibble
over
the
body
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
plenty
of
khaki
colored
head
coffee
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
more
coffee
and
some
roasted
malt
way
too
toastedburned
for
me
an
excellent
example
of
a
wellmade
stout
but
the
price
point
may
be
a
touch
too
high
for
what
one
gets
wouldnt
mind
changing
my
morning
black
tea
with
this
beer
but
wouldnt
like
to
get
fired
either
great
coffee
character
with
strong
hops
managing
to
simply
put
some
extra
character
in
here
without
stealing
or
messing
up
with
the
show
thats
more
like
it
beer
for
breakfast
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
one
i
had
my
only
regret
is
that
i
cant
actually
have
this
for
breakfast
the
cork
nearly
popped
off
on
its
own
when
i
took
the
muselet
off
pours
black
with
a
several
fingers
thick
frothy
brown
head
smells
of
cocoa
dark
roast
malts
and
some
coffee
with
maybe
a
light
floral
hop
scent
dark
chocolate
and
roast
coffee
emerged
as
it
warmed
up
tastes
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
powder
sweet
malts
moderate
hop
sweetness
fading
to
piney
the
medium
to
heavy
body
itself
was
excellent
but
it
was
very
heavily
carbonated
which
took
away
from
the
flavor
and
feel
not
sure
if
it
is
always
like
that
or
just
this
batch
flavor
and
smell
really
popped
once
the
beer
warmed
and
the
carbonation
dissipated
left
with
pine
resin
on
the
palate
and
lips
as
well
as
a
lingering
dark
roast
flavor
despite
the
heavy
carbonation
it
was
still
an
excellent
beer
o
very
good
4
for
whatever
reason
the
dominant
flavor
profile
i
got
out
of
my
sample
at
daytons
big
beer
and
barleywines
was
smoke
as
in
rauchbier
style
smokiness
totally
unexpected
not
necessarily
something
id
seek
out
but
as
a
try
once
it
was
well
worth
the
sampler
pours
out
inky
black
and
viscous
with
a
thick
dark
chocolate
brown
head
the
head
melts
aways
quickly
but
still
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rich
deep
roasted
malts
hints
of
coffee
toffee
and
oat
the
taste
is
delicious
with
all
the
aroma
notes
present
and
mixing
together
with
the
nice
addition
of
the
hops
to
add
a
pleasant
twist
on
the
style
the
body
is
slick
and
there
is
a
little
bite
on
the
finish
a
great
big
stout
overall
im
very
disappointed
with
this
one
especially
7
99
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
not
for
me
this
is
a
well
made
beer
but
one
that
i
just
didnt
care
for
i
love
intense
bitterness
in
ipas
and
dipas
but
i
found
that
level
of
bitterness
to
be
offputting
in
a
stout
great
roastedcharredburnt
coffee
flavor
and
if
you
like
central
waters
16
or
maybe
even
ba
old
raspy
youll
probably
like
this
one
a
lot
overall
this
was
solid
buy
wont
buy
again
for
the
price
and
gelatin
one
of
the
roastier
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
just
short

smokey
another
great
pickup
at

ooverall
a
great
stout
was
glad
to
get
a
growler
especially
25
off
what
a
steal
overall
this
beer
is
a
solid
option
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bitterforward
stout
i
personally
didnt
get
much
of
the
coffee
taste
but
it
is
there
for
me
i
wish
the
ibus
were
dropped
a
little
and
id
like
it
better
o
excellent
stout
that
brings
espresso
level
bitterness
to
the
table
very
similar
to
others
offered
by
mikkeller
and
evil
twin
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
happy
to
taste
the
beer
that
put
mikkeller
on
the
map
m
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
of
this
abv
and
chalky
dry
as
if
i
needed
to
reiterate
o
truly
a
breakfast
beer
tastes
of
coffe
and
chocolate
smells
and
tastes
wonderful
o
definatly
a
decent
stout
but
after
the
high
expectations
from
the
nose
i
found
this
to
be
a
small
let
down
in
all
fairness
this
was
my
second
drink
of
the
day
and
had
big
shoes
to
fill
it
followed
a
kbs
which
was
definately
the
climax
of
the
morning
i
will
try
this
one
again
overall
a
really
roasted
coffee
flavor
one
of
the
biggest
maybe
i
have
had
but
the
price
makes
this
a
hard
one
to
have
often
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
i
really
enjoy
oatmeal
stouts
and
coffee
stouts
and
this
is
a
great
blending
of
the
two
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
if
you
get
the
chance
give
this
a
try
overall
i
thought
this
was
good
not
great
ive
passed
it
by
through
the
years
and
saw
a
big
bottle
format
and
jumped
maybe
the
small
bottle
is
the
way
to
go
dunno
that
being
said
i
did
consume
the
entire
bottle
so
go
figure
2011
22oz
bottle
from
cellar
poured
into
pfreim
tulip
deep
black
color
with
finger
of
brown
head
bigger
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
for
being
so
old
lots
of
oaty
coffee
aroma
with
a
nice
roasted
note
roasted
chocolate
and
a
bunch
of
coffee
in
the
flavor
lots
of
coffee
in
fact
there
was
a
lot
of
actual
grinds
in
this
one
a
bit
bitter
but
thats
expected
with
the
coffee
really
nice
one
here
and
was
excellent
with
about
3
years
age
on
it
excellent
specimen
would
recommend
would
buy
again
o
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
one
could
have
used
a
hint
more
sweetness
overall
a
solid
offering
from
mikkeller
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
all
in
all
a
very
good

while
before

to
try
this
one
happy
i
did
oyou
know
the
saying
send
my
regards
to
the
chef
etc
roast
and
lingering
bitterness
looking
forward
to
trying
this

some

this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
features
a
complex
array
of
bitterness
but
it
is
not
as

either

like
the
summer
olympics
overall
this
was
really
good
mild
signs
of
abv
paired
well
with
the
big
flavors
pours
deep
and
dark
with
a
big
brown
frothy
head
aroma
of
chocolate
big
roast
dried
fruits
and
a
big
hop
presence
not
a
lot
of
coffee
on
the
nose
coffe
and
hops
come
up
front
with
a
huge
blast
of
roasted
bittersweet
chocolate
lingering
cocoa
and
sweet
fruit
left
on
the
palate
relatively
high
carbonation
for
the
style
bur
still
retains
a
nice
silkiness
bitter
really
lasts
nice
stout
that
sits
somewhere
on
the
flavor
profile
scale
between
plead
the
5th
and
darkness
with
focus
on
the
bitter
cocoa
and
with
less
chewiness
overall
its
a
solid
coffee
stout
that
has
a
strong
taste
profile
o
ok
only
a
bit
of
espresso
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
of
a
flavorful
stout
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
in
that
regard
it
coats
the
tongue
rather
evenly
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
to
really
show
what
is
like
to
get
coffee
beer
overall
a
very
good
brew
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
especially
after
having
brunch
weasel
from
mikkeller
which
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
hop
presence
was
very
bright
and
i
felt
hide
some
of
the
other
characteristics
of
this
beer
i
expected
the
dark
flavor
notes
and
has
many
rich
complex
flavors
but
this
beer
has
a
sharp
bitter
bite
at
the
end
which
i
didnt
expect
this
pours
black
with
a
creamy
brown
head
there
is
a
mild
aroma
of
coffee
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
creamy
coffee
mixture
i
was
expecting
a
little
thicker
texture
as
this
was
thinner
than
i
imagined
finished
slightly
bitter
a
pretty
nice
find
that
i
wasnt
expecting
atmosphere
is
really
strong
dark
and
intimidating
fair
head
and
plenty
of
persistent
lacing
nose
is
coffee
chocolate
peat
and
malt
grains
all
char
roasted
earthy
bittersweet
grains
accentuated
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
o
a
bit
disappointed
expected
some
better
balance
here
instead
i
am
overwhelmed
by
the
bitterness
of
the
various
ingredients
coffee
char
hop
bitterness
bitter
chocolate
could
use
some
residual
sweetness
to
smooth
things
out
a
rather
expensive
bottle
that
didnt
deliver
as
much
of
the
goods
as
i
had
hoped
overall
i
have
to
say
this
beer
was
a
disappointment
to
me
especially
given
the
price
however
to
those
bas
who
love
extremely
intense
coffee
flavors
im
sure
this
beer
is
a
godsend
myself
i
like
more
sweetness
for
balance
and
more
complementary
flavors
as
well
for
example
sweet
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
to
help
offset
the
bitterness
of
coffee
and
add
a
little
complexity
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bells
java
stout
except
that
its
nearly
6
times
the
price
but
hey
dont
listen
to
me
if
you
like
stouts
with
intense
coffee
flavor
and
dont
mind
the
bitterness
you
should
seek
this
out
o
if
you
love
a
good
coffee
stout
this
short
be
on
your
short
list
of
beers
to
track
down
a
big
robust
stout
with
rich
intertwining
layers
of
heavily
roasted
malts
and
coffee
beans
very
smooth
easy
drinking
for
7
5
beer
delicious
coffee
aromas
and
tastes
wonderful
chocolate
flavors
and
very
rich
and
creamy
i
almost
feel
like
i
had
a
perfect
iced
coffee
rather
than
an
imperial
stout
yet
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
heat
beautiful
creamy
head
pitch
black
and
so
easy
going
down
i
can
truly
see
how
people
could
drink
this
for
breakfast
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
in
this
series
well
done
mikkeller
overall
quite
good
not
something
i
would
search
high
and
low
for
but

with
a
one
inch

that
leaves

roasted

is
all
of
that
with
roasted

plenty

extremely

appearance
oily

fresh

very
well
orchestrated
blend
of

no

than
the

is
not
overly

extremely
smooth

minimal
carbonation
mouth

overall
excellent
coffee
stout
wnb
is
comparable
but
this
seems
to
end
up
more
integrated
and
with
no
acidity
o
love
my
coffee
stouts
and
this
was
no
let
down
really
great
stuff
maybe
just
a
touch
more
sweetness
and
it
would
be
perfect
for
me
on
the
expensive
side
but
a
delicious
treat
paired
very
well
with
a
founders
porter
cupcake
o
this
is
a
damn
pleasure
to
drink
i
love
nonsweet
coffee
stouts
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
one
as
suggested
by
the
name
of
the
beer
i
enjoyed
it
with
breakfast
and
what
a
damn
fine
way
to
start
the
day
since
i
bought
this
in
ireland
it
was
relatively
cheap
but
i
know
in
america
its
pretty
damn
expensive
but
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
on
a
special
occasion
for
breakfast
itll
definitely
pair
well
with
lots
of
breakfasts
another
letdown
by
mikkeller
why
must
you
always
disappoint
i
had
big
hopes
for
you
but
your
dark
rich
appearance
did
not
match
your
taste
you
were
thin
overly
carbonated
and
dominated
by
roasted
malts
coffee
i
tasted
none
maybe
it
was
the
bitter
back
end
that
was
to
be
coffee
i
will
never
know
thanks
but
ill
stay
with
the
local
breakfast
stouts
o
super
solid
worth
having
for
the
aroma
alone
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
black
like
motor
oil
with
a
thin
chocolate
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
a
small
lace
cap
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
i
get
plenty
of
dark
roasted
coffee
on
the
nose
with
some
chocolate
those
big
coffee
flavors
are
there
but
are
greatly
complemented
by
the
dark
roasted
malt
and
the
smoothness
to
the
mouthfeel
the
oatmeal
brings
still
this
is
a
very
coffee
forward
stout
with
only
some
chocolate
flavor
with
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
the
beer
drinks
pretty
well
plus
at
7
5
it
doesnt
have
the
harsh
alcohol
feel
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
only
just
so
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
one
finger
thick
creamy
light
brown
colored
head
settles
to
a
thin
ring
a

espresso
burnt
earthy
slightly
acidic
cocoa
a
little
bracing
with
the
burnt
bitterness
but
thats
ok
medium
bodied
creamy
feel
very
nice
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
tasty
morsel
for
a
long
time
the
pour
is
wonderful
pitch
black
with
a
finger
of
mocha
head
that
retains
very
well
the
aroma
is
a
little
weak
but
offers
a
nice
roasted
coffee
the
taste
is
really
just
about
all
that
i
could
want
from
a
coffee
stout
theres
a
nice
and
strong
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
pairs
very
well
with
the
oat
sweetness
and
smoothness
overall
beer
geek
breakfast
is
an
extremely
tasty
coffee
stout
the
new
11
2oz
bottles
are
actually
a
fairly
good
deal
as
far
as
mikkeller
prices
go
as
well
the
beer
pours
like
pitch
black
oil
thick
and
sludgelike
this
beer
looks
like
the
dregs
of
french
press
coffee
it
pours
with
a
small
dark
khakilight
brown
head
of
bubbles
that
fizzles
away
to
leave
a
scrim
moving
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
body
is
too
dark
to
see
through
and
the
head
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
middling
roast
malt
and
coffee
with
a
slight
vegetaldark
fruit
smell
that
seems
to
be
coming
from
the
coffee
grainy
oats
also
bristle
over
the
nose
like
hot
oatmeal
and
blend
beautifully
with
the
roast
coffee
i
was
a
little
concerned
when
i
first
sniffed
this
beer
but
as
it
sits
in
my
snifter
its
scent
exponentially
rises
in
enticement
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
of
big
coffee
bitter
roast
with
a
light
sweet
hint
from
the
malt
and
coffee
beans
and
a
slight
bite
of
acidity
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
dark
fruits
which
immediately
explodes
in
roasted
coffee
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
that
dries
the
beer
out
and
brings
layer
upon
layer
of
coffee
flavors
to
the
tongue
running
from
dark
fruits
to
chocolate
to
roasted
malts
this
beers
flavor
profile
is
perfect
for
the
morning
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
creamy
and
medium
in
body
which
is
surprisingly
light
for
a
stout
of
this
size
but
must
be
due
to
the
added
coffee
the
beers
carbonation
is
light
and
just
gives
a
faint
prick
to
the
tongue
allowing
the
coffee
and
malt
flavors
to
dominate
the
mouth
the
mouth
is
left
bitter
dry
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
and
a
decent
amount
of
acid
neutralizing
saliva
running
through
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
stout
that
really
hits
the
coffee
lovers
sweet
spot
the
coffee
flavors
are
brilliantly
represented
in
this
beer
unlike
founders
breakfast
stout
this
beer
showcases
the
coffee
as
the
center
of
your
palate
instead
fbss
beautiful
balance
but
this
beers
coffee
is
perfect
on
the
tongue
i
would
love
to
knock
this
beer
back
in
the
morning
as
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
coffee
roast
flavoring
to
start
the
morning
this
beer
is
great
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
it
o
ended
up
really
enjoying
this
i
dont
remember
the
previous
batches
being
quite
as
good
so
ive
shied
away
from
this
but
ill
be
more
tempted
to
buy
it
in
the
future
extremely
dark
brown
close
to
black
head
is
medium
and
apparent
look
is
almost
perfect
strong
coffee
aroma
on
the
nose
taste
is
an
abundance
of
roasted
coffee
and
oats
slight
chocolate
too
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
not
too
thick
and
not
too
light
just
where
it
should
be
alcohol
i
snot
apparent
whatsoever
im
really
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
fbs
being
one
of
my
faves
and
this
is
a
great
substitute
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
my
first
minkkeller
brew
great
flavor
wellrounded
and
all
around
tasty
looking
forward
to
trying
more
o
impressive
how
the
traditional
ingredients
maltyeasthops
mingle
with
the
coffee
its
a
very
good
stout
for
its
category
the
roasted
nuttymalt
taste
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
and
could
have
been
knocked
down
a
few
notches
but
overall
very
good
in
the
aftertaste
a
good
rootlike
bitterness
and
a
plesant
cappuccino
effect
great
imperial
stout
to
say
the
least
this
is
a
really
wellmade
beer
and
i
can
totally
see
how
it
gets
the
marks
that
it
does
i
never
felt
like
pulling
the
trigger
on
the
slightly
expensive
bottle
whenever
i
see
it
but
im
glad
i
got
it
now
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
stout
perfect
winter
companion
overall
this
is
damn
good
not
as
much
going
on
as
in
breakfast
stout
but
still
incredible
never
the
less
7

a
strong
tasting
imperial
stout
it
seems
slightly
stronger
than
the
7
5
abv
would
suggest
but
it
goes
down
well
with
a
nice
kick
to
it
and
is
packed
with
both
aroma
and
flavour
in
abundance
very
enjoyable
another
great
stout
offering
from
mikkeller
smells
of
mellow
coffee
caramel
fruit
notes
burnt
malts
great
mouthfeel
incredibly
smooth
and
very
mildly
carbonated
the
coffee
comes
through
exceptionally
not
overpowering
but
you
definitely
know
it
is
there
i
have
bought
this
a
few
times
and
continue
to
everytime
i
see
it
in
stores
there
is
a
reason
it
is
known
as
one
of
the
better
breakfast
stouts
overall
to
be
honest
it
failed
to
live
to
my
expectation
but
its
still
a
great
introduction
to
the
world
of
imperial
russian
stouts
o
too
much
coffee
it
overpowers
any
other
flavor
that
might
be
present
the
coffee
bitterness
is
pretty
overwhelming
an
im
also
a
coffee
geek
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
i
was
pretty
excited
about
this
beer
but
it
fell
short
with
me
probably
wont
be
having
this
again
overall
4

a
very
well
done
oatmeal
stout
without
overpowering
coffee
while
still
being
prominent
the
7
5
abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
this
is
very
drinkable
othis
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
at
first
the
acrid
smokiness
was
overpowering
and
i
was
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
distinct
coffee
notes
to
be
accurate
i
would
say
that
the
coffee
flavor
was
there
but
it
tasted
burned
anyway
as
things
warmed
up
and
my
palate
adjusted
the
flavors
began
to
gel
and
the
acrid
flavors
subsided
a
bit
but
never
completely
disappeared
thin
tan
head
with
some
lacing
on
a
jet
black
body
dark
cocoa
coffee
and
roasted
and
smoked
malts
very
good
aroma
but
a
little
simple
and
just
a
little
light
flavors
include
a
very
well
balanced
with
the
coffee
very
well
applied
to
a
smoked
malt
base
beer
with
earthy
hopped
character
medium
to
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
simple
but
what
it
does
it
does
well
very
smooth
flavorful
and
incredibly
drinkable
it
is
really
a
complete
breakfast
very
complex
and
balanced
beer
it
perfectly
substitutes
your
morning
or
evening
coffee
great
beer
o
my
first
mikkeller
a
pretty
decent
brew
theres
something
off
about
the
smelltaste
that
had
me
checking
for
a
bottling
date
there
isnt
one
still
an
enjoyable
beer
the
smoke
and
dank
hops
were
a
pleasant
surprise
low
score
on
the
appearance
cuz
frankly
shes
ugly
i
know
adding
oats
sacrafices
appearance
for
a
creamier
mouthfeel
but
i
have
had
prettier
beers
w
creamier
mouthfeel
then
this
a
nice
imperial
stout
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
if
you
like
creamy
coffee
flavors
overall
who
cant
love
a
breakfast
stout
paired
this
with
a
fbs
and
it
came
off
smokier
with
less
coffee
nonetheless
an
incredible
stout
that
id
recommend
to
any
coffee
beer
fan
o
a
great
looking
beer
with
an
amazing
aroma
and
great
taste
a
bit
bitter
but
hey
this
will
wake
you
up
and
get
you
going
on
a
slow
morning
especially
while
brewing
like
i
am
right
now
o
this
is
a
good
brew
for
coffee
lovers
it
hits
that
spot
but
as
far
as
a
well
rounded
oatmeal
coffee
stout
the
mouth
feel
loses
me
i
so
much
want
to
love
this
beer
though
maybe
some
age
will
throw
some
difference
in
this
or
maybe
im
just
saying
this
to
make
myself
feel
better
o
love
it
if
you
dont
like
coffee
i
suspect
you
wont
dig
this
i
can
drink
this
all
day
smooth
brew
o
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
just
a
slightly
above
average
beer
and
im
being
generous
i
was
extremely
surprised
on
just
how
much
tobacco
was
present
in
this
brew
and
i
thought
that
it
was
over
done
it
is
a
very
robust
and
bold
brew
which
is
a
good
quality
as
long
as
it
is
in
balance
but
i
find
the
balance
to
be
off
this
is
very
lovely
to
have
with
a
breakfast
dinner
i
made
a
bacon
and
extra
sharp
cheddar
omelette
for
dinner
this
beer
was
a
fantastic
pairing
it
cut
through
the
sharpness
of
the
cheese
enhanced
the
smokey
flavor
imparted
by
the
bacon
and
complimented
the
fresh
course
ground
black
pepper
i
added
to
the
eggs
i
could
also
see
this
as
dessert
or
with
a
properly
grilled
mediumrare
ny
strip
steak
o
fantastic
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
outstanding
beer
a
sipper
to
be
sure
not
for
the
7
5
abv
but
for
the
strong
complex
flavors
and
the
drying
finish
this
is
one
everyone
should
try
at
some
point
pours
a
black
color
with
a
rocky
brown
head
with
large
bubbles
medium
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
strong
coffee
toffee
chocolate
and
piney
hop
real
coffee
comes
first
in
the
taste
title
is
not
a
lie
fresh
character
from
malt
and
hoppy
notes
palate
is
smooth
but
unfortunately
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
some
astringency
from
the
roasted
character
and
a
dry
finish
that
lingers
well
along
a
medium
bitterness
really
good
beer
but
it
frankly
didnt
impress
me
more
than
that
perhaps
a
bit
too
straightforward
o
one
of
better
coffee
beers
ive
tasted
a
real
treat
id
definitely
buy
this
again
mikkeller
beer
geek
breakfast
the
bottle
says
breakfast
is
the
most
important
meal
of
the
day
and
to
beer
geeks
like
mikkeller
a
hearty
complex
stout
is
the
tastiest
way
to
begin
the
day
this
unique
mix
of
an
oat
and
coffee
stout
creates
an
intense
fullbodied
beer
which
is
surprisingly
balanced
and
full
of
new
taste
adventures
with
every
sip
overall
a
very
nice
stout
with
lots
if
different
tastes
ranging
from
tobacco
smoke
to
chocolate
to
malt
to
coffee
i
thought
the
coffee
was
a
little
more
muted
than
what
i
would
have
liked
to
see
the
only
downfall
in
my
eyes
is
that
there
is
nothing
that
stood
out
as
being
oh
my
on
this
one
very
solid
all
around
but
lacking
that
geez
x
is
damn
good
aspect
overall
a
solid
stout
thats
worth
a
try
some
people
compare
this
to
fbs
but
in
my
opinion
fbs
outshines
this
one
overall
tasty
if
muted
in
many
ways
i
like
it
but
would
take
other
coffee
stouts
over
this
and
definitely
prefer
brunch
weasel
moreys
bottom
line
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
every
bit
as
good
as
founders
breakfast
stout
fbs
dare
i
say
a
touch
better
get
some
if
you
have
the
chance
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
but
greatly
balanced
and
doesnt
overplay
the
coffee
od
a
interesting
stout
more
on
the
coffee
roasted
end
of
the
style
moderately
filling
and
not
overtly
strong
well
worth
the
try
o
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
the
only
drawback
that
i
noticed
was
the
slight
alcohol
taste
while
drinking
some
of
it
other
than
that
a
great
example
of
an
imperial
stout
o
a
tasty
bitter
coffee
stout
perfect
for
early
morning
or
late
nite
sipping
my
only
complaint
is
the
high
price
tag
so
i
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
soon
cheers

o
very
solid
stout
from
mikkeller
if
you
like
coffee
like
i
do
you
will
like
this
beer
overall
im
still
and
fbs
guy
but
this
is
damn
good
and
a
different
beast
overall
my
first
mikkeller
beer
was
quite
a
successful
experience
this
beer
hits
hard
in
the
bitterness
thanks
to
the
coffee
but
as
a
lover
of
coffee
that
is
just
fine
to
those
who
are
not
fans
of
coffee
do
not
purchase
this
beer
there
are
sweeter
stouts
out
there
that
will
be
much
more
to
your
liking
left

stout

slush
and

mokah
come
to
mind
for
those
of
us
who
enjoy
a
delicious
black
cup
of
joe
this
is
the
coffee
stout
you
have
been
searching
for
for
the
alcoholics
among
us
this
might
just
be
the
best
part
of
waking
up
1720
this
one
is
a
slow
sipping
beer
remarkably
reminiscent
of
my
morning
cup
of
coffee
which
i
brew
very
strong
id
certainly
drink
it
again
but
im
not
so
in
love
with
it
that
id
purchase
it
at
the
expense
of
trying
something
new
or
revisiting
an
old
favorite
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
on
tap
about
a
year
ago
but
sitting
at
home
focused
on
it
i
am
much
happier
with
it
i
probably
wont
reach
for
this
one
regularly
but
when
im
in
the
mood
to
mix
it
up
a
bit
i
can
see
myself
going
for
it
again
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
the
complexity
of
this
wellcrafted
beer
a
really
good
iconic
beer
pours
a
jet
black
with
2
fingers
of
tan
head
nice
retention
and
some
patchy
lacing
followed
smells
of
chocolatey
coffee
toasted
grains
toatsed
macadamian
nuts
smells
very
oaty
the
taste
is
a
fantastic
sweet
nutty
hazelnut
like
flavor
with
coffee
subtle
bitterness
from
all
the
roasted
grains
this
is
a
wonderfully
executed
stout
medium
body
with
some
creamy
feel
on
the
lips
medium
carbonation
but
goes
down
silky
smooth
im
torn
between
this
and
the
calvados
beer
geek
brunch
though
i
have
to
favor
this
one
because
of
the
price
tag

notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
dark
brown
with
a
dark
brown
head
nice
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
sweet
malt
roasted
malts
with
some
smoke
coffee
finishes
with
a
pleasant
charred
coffee
bitterness
somewhat
thinner
than
a
typical
oatmeal
stout
but
makes
up
for
it
with
flavor
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
nice
but
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
body
and
malt
character
taste
coffee
forward
to
say
the
least
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
delves
smoother
and
smoother
the
more
you
drink
of
it
runs
the
gamut
of
tastes
can
be
bitter
and
burnt
early
on
then
can
devolve
into
a
nicer
smoothness
while
still
allowing
the
coffee
to
be
the
primary
flavor
going
on
but
its
not
simply
a
one
trick
pony
theres
actually
plenty
of
that
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
going
on
as
well
here
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
hides
alcohol
decently
this
is
another
winner
from
mikkeller
only
real
downside
is
the
price
but
its
not
out
of
the
realm
of
another
purchase
down
the
road
despite
the
price
because
its
good
enough
to
justify
it

and

a

lets

coffee

serious

resting
on

to
be
enjoyed
at
the
very
end
smell
consists
of
light
oats
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
follows
suite
however
for
some
reason
a
metallic
flavor
that
i
do
not
particularly
enjoy
but
can
tolerate
and
even
overlook
is
present
i
believe
this
is
down
to
the
age
of
the
beer
it
has
been
sitting
for
some
time
but
this
is
only
a
theory
as
i
have
yet
to
test
it
multiple
times
this
is
the
second
time
i
let
one
of
these
beers
sit
that
its
had
a
slight
metallic
flavor
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
some
bitterness
on
the
end
which
is
expected
overall
good
beer
id
like
to
open
it
fresher
next
time
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
the
flavor
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
and
the
mouthfeel
is
subpar
the
aroma
and
appearance
are
right
where
you
want
them
while
it
doesnt
compare
well
with
many
of
the
higher
rated
imperial
stouts
or
coffee
stouts
on
the
market
id
still
say
this
one
is
worth
trying
edit
this
beer
improved
tremendously
when
paired
with
some
aged
irish
cheddar
i
had
in
the
fridge
the
cheese
wards
off
most
of
the
harsh
tannin
o
man
this
must
have
been
a
coffee
bomb
when
it
was
fresh
coffee
dominates
throughout
despite
the
age
wish
it
were
a
little
better
balanced
or
smoothed
out
not
a
bad
beer
just
fairly
onedimensional
especially
for
an
imperial
stout
doa
o
a
great
breakfast
stout
but
not
the
best
out
there
highly
recommended
d
happy
to
try
this
one
even
if
it
wasnt
as
fresh
as
i
would
have
liked
i
never
know
what
to
expect
when
i
buy
a
mikkeller
beer
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
an
all
around
solid
imperial
stout
with
a
nice
coffee
presence
but
ill
take
ddcs
péché

over
this
now
if
only
i
could
get
my
hands
on
some
ba
versions
of
this

its

overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
actually
surprised
me
quite
a
bit
maybe
because
i
just
wasnt
expecting
very
much
from
this
beer
since
its
not
a
limited
release
barrel
aged
beer
then
again
i
expected
a
more
pronounced
coffee
flavor
but
i
dont
feel
that
what
led
me
to
not
really
like
this
beer
quite
as
much
as
most
people
there
just
seemed
to
be
a
lack
of
harmoniousness
and
balance
compared
to
what
you
would
normally
look
for
in
this
type
of
beer

after

there
is
a

watery
aspect
to
this
beer
but
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
tasty
stout
from
mikkeller
i
really
like
the
dual
combination
of
coffee
and
oat
tastes
present
in
this
one
o
tastes
like
more
this
is
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
ive
had
the
luck
of
trying
an
exceptional
beer
in
every
aspect
o
a
little
disappointed
with
this
thought
the
coffee
taste
would
be
more
prevalent
in
a
beer
that
calls
itself
beer

taste
roasted

hits
first
followed
by
a

flavor
ended
with
a
roasted
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
finish
so
much
going
on
here
and
this
will
probably
change
a
lot
as
it
warms
served
at
55
degrees
mouthfeel
the
oatmeal
in
this
brings
some
nice
thickness
that
reminds
you
its
a
stout
but
it
is
nice
and
syrupy
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
in
tandem
in
every
sip
and
it
is
perfect
for
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
the
flavors
complement
each
other
well
so
i
could
drink
this
many
times
over
and
yes
i
could
have
this
for
breakfast
ive
been
dissapointed
with
mikeller
beers
before
but
this
one
is
fantastic
well
done
o
very
smooth
drinking
stout
the
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
just
make
this
so
great
a
very
good
drinking
beer
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
anyone
has
aged
this
one
for
a
year
maybe
the
flavour
profile
would
round
out
more
o
this
is
a
good
stout
i
expected
a
much
stronger
coffee
flavor
judging
by
the
picture
on
the
bottle
but
it
wasnt
does
remind
you
of
breakfast
in
a
way
but
nothing
compared
to
founders
bs
ok
to
try
although
for
the
quality
of
the
beer
the
price
is
lingering
on
high
for
what
you
get
overall
classified
as
a
double
stout
i
stand
by
my
scores
there
are
better
out
there
and
most
are
priced
cheaper
on
a
side
note
if
this
was
categorized
as
an
oatmeal
stout
as
the
label
states
this
might
receive
5s
across
the
board
treat
yourself
to
a
danish
brew
o
i
wasnt
a
fan
overall
i
told
my
wife
as
i
was
drinking
it
that
it
tasted
somewhat
like
an
ash
tray
ill
stand
by
that
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
quickly
dissipating
brown
head
no
lacing
nice
aroma
big
roasted
coffee
beans
and
milk
chocolate
carries
over
into
the
flavor
profile
this
one
tastes
like
a
dark
roast
coffee
definitely
lives
up
to
the
beer
geek
breakfast
name
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
cream
and
some
crisp
pine
hops
finish
it
up
overall
a
solid
brew
led
by
its
strong
roasted
coffee
profile
o
a
well
put
together
oatmeal
stout
completely
understand
why
every
raves
about
their
stuff
a
bit
pricey
in
my
opinion
to
warrant
a
repurchase
but
i
am
not
at
all
upset
that
i
splashed
the
cash
this
one
time
glassware
chalice
some
may
find
this
stout
to
be
too
sweet
but
it
suits
me
fine
this
is
a
big
stout
that
truly
embraces
the
dark
roasty
goodness
a
big
dark
monster
that
is
perfectly
roasted
not
burnt
and
a
little
hoppier
than
expected
but
in
a
subtle
enjoyable
way
d
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
makes
it
easy
to
drink
hops
make
sure
it
doesnt
wear
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
cozy
but
not
too
heavy

not

on

everything
is
mildly
blended
together
and
comes
together
perfectly
nothing
overpowers
so
everything
can
be
enjoyed
the
malt
has
a
kind
of
spicy
quality
on
the
palate
that
is
different
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
come
to
dominate
and
linger
with
a
touch
of
honey
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
and
makes
it
super
easy
to
drink
definitely
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
d
pretty
good
no
terrapin
wakenbake
or
pisgah
valdez
though
and
definitely
not
as
friendly
on
the

as
those
two
a
nice
beer
though
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
poured
a

the
smell
or
roasted

and
a
hint
of
smoke
was
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
had
the
roasted

semisweet
chocolate
and
a
fair
amount
of
coffee
a
nicely
balanced
stout
without
a
real
bitter
finish
a
pleasant
tasting
mild
stout
this
is
one
fantastic
looking

a
nice
balance
of
the

some
sweet
chocolatey

soft
and
creamy
on
the

just
a
great
example
of
the
style
nothing
is
overpowering
great
easy
to
drink
beer
d
buy
it
yes
drink
it
of
course
more
than
one
youre
braver
than
i
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
chewy
but
not
as
heavy
as
some
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
coffee
stout
full
of
flavor
without
being
too
big
and
boozy
perfect
for
having
with
breakfast
d
the
light
body
and
balanced
flavor
profile
makes
this
a
smooth
drinking
beer
excellent
beer
all
around
and
worth
the
price
and
the
search
dm
not
overly
heavy
for
the
weight
of
the
flavor
and
the
style
in
other
words
its
not
engine
oil
still
great
feel
and
carbonation
d
this
is
a
pretty
full
bodied
and
flavoured
stout
for
the
relatively
low
abv
if
you
see
it
buy
it
pours
a
black
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
light
on
the
edges
two
fingers
of
mocha
colored
head
smells
is
only
barely
detectable
not
much
there
at
all
some
coffee
notes
some
earthy
notes
and
not
much
else
bitter
coffee
bean
no
sweetness
has
some
acidity
as
well
not
that
much
else
happening
here
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
bitterness
hangs
on
for
a
while
drinkability
eh
glad
i
tried
but
wont
be
buying
another
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
weasel
i
have
been
saving
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
try
it
although
you
wont
like
it
enough
to
stock
your
beer
cellar
with
imo
this
is
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
at
10
for
16
9
oz
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
loved
this
beer
id
get
it
again
only
the
3rd
mikkeller
beer
ive
had
but
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
all
my
first
mikkeller
review
d
this
was
pretty
robust
a
little
bitter
and
filling
definitely
a
dessert
beer
d
split
into
two
servings
its
a
sipper
perfect
way
to
start
a
good
beer
day
id
definately
drink
this
again
yum
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
jet
black
and
viscous
looking
with
a
deliciously
thick
milk
chocolate
colored
head
that
begs
to
be
devoured
this
head
has
staying
power
and
the
beer
itself
leaves
a
fantastic
lovely
lacing
along
the
glass
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
coffee
nut
and
alcohol
are
emenating
from
the
glass
throughout
the
pour
this
is
a
smooth
and
creamy
mfer
of
a
stout
chocolate
hits
your
tongue
first
but
coffee
is
hot
on
its
heels
there
are
some
grainycereal
type
flavors
in
there
as
well
which
help
balance
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
the
beers
body
as
stated
before
is
creamy
and
smooth
very
pleasant
smooth
and
subtle
finish
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
subtle
sweet
and
bitter
blend
of
the
coffee
flavors
very
drinkable
and
this
beer
goes
with
just
about
anything
delicious
d
it
drank
decent
and
definitely
would
be
a
breakfast
beer
if
i
drank
coffee
every
morning
d
would
only
want
one
of
these
per
session
between
richness
coffee
flavor
and
abv
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
i
had
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
and
the
alcohol
isnt
imposing
but
i
was
kind
of
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
this
beer
as
it
is
now
i
would
compare
it
to
troegs
java
head
with
a
bit
of
coffee
infusion
it
has
similar
texture
hop
finish
and
transition
from
coffee
to
malts
but
more
robust
not
a
bad
beer
but
similar
alternatives
are
out
there
for
a
much
more
reasonable
price
there
are
a
limited
amount
of
times
the
description
on
the
bottle
grabs
my
attention
and
gets
me
to
buy
it
but
this
beer
was
one
of
those
times
the
small
description
on
the
bottle
is
a
good
read
and
pretty
much
hooks
me
i
am
glad
i
purchased
this
as
it
is
a
solid
beer
d
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
youll
keep
these
coming
as
long
as
theyre
around
my
first
time
having
a
breakfast
stout
and
it
was
a
great
experience
this
definitely
goes
well
with
breakfast
and
ill
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
so
creamy
chewy
mouthfeel
drinks
slow
both
from
its
creamy
thickness
and
the
richness
of
flavor
delicious
and
wonderful
definitely
drinkable
and
a
great
foundation
for
other
mikkeller
stouts
like
weasel
and
rauch
the
original
beer
geek
breakfast
is
a
worthy
brew
in
and
of
itself
in
that
way
it
doesnt
do
much
to
distinguish
itself
within
the
style
rather
it
focuses
on
being
solid
and
representative
of
what
an
imperial
stout
should
be
good
stuff
unspectacular
but
good
drinkability
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
i
wish
i
would
have
popped
it
open
sooner
when
it
was
much
fresher
but
its
good
i
will
admit
though
that
i
may
have
a
hard
time
in
the
future
grabbing
more
just
because
of
the
cost
theres
a
lot
of
good
drinkin
stouts
out
there
for
less
drinkability
this
was
an
awesome
stout
very
good
i
will
definitely
want
more
of
this
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
the
flavors
are
present
and
high
quality
just
a
bit
thin
which
detracts
from
the
taste
but
keeps
it
more
on
the
consumable
side
very
good
di
thoroughly
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
over
about
an
hour
but
one
was
plenty
if
you
dont
like
coffee
steer
far
clear
of
this
one
it
packs
a
serious
punch
in
that
department
that
said
definitely
nailed
the
idea
of
breakfast
in
a
bottle
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
close
to
black
but
not
quite
there
the
head
is
a
huge
decadent
layer
of
light
brown
foam
almost
looks
like
nice
crema
on
an
espresso
the
beer
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
milk
dark
coffee
vanilla
and
an
earthy
nutmeg
tyoe
spice
very
complex
once
it
warms
the
taste
is
dark
roasted
coffee
with
sweet
cream
and
little
backbone
of
hot
cocoa
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
earthy
hop
presence
that
really
helps
to
balance
the
sweetness
very
dry
on
the
finish
and
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
like
you
just
finished
a
cup
of
coffee
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
the
perfect
amount
of
light
carbonation
and
goes
down
very
easily
while
staying
very
complex
for
a
7
5
stout
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
mikkeler
albeit
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
i
will
revisit
this
one
but
its
more
like
a
once
a
year
beer
than
a
regular
offering
d
overall
a
nice
experience
all
the
same
though
i
can
almost
buy
a
4pk
of
founders
breakfast
stout
for
the
same
price
its
worth
sampling
but
there
are
better
values
out
there
for
repeat
purchases
notes
maybe
i
should
rate
this
higher
it
is
nothing
mind
shattering
but
in
how
it
gets
together
the
oatmeal
cream
with
the
coffee
woven
around
the
long
and
rich
stout
this
is
quite
remarkable
and
as
an
added
extra
this
is
brewed
at
nøgne
ø
which
it
is
the
first
time
i
taste
something
from
them
i
was
looking
forward
to
try
it
and
sure
enough
ill
seek
them
out
in
the
future
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
suffers
from
being
a
bit
of
a
lightweight
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
beer
geek
breakfast
feels
creamy
smooth
in
the
mouth
coating
your
palate
with
its
delectable
flavors
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
coffee
beers
and
this
one
certainly
lived
up
to
my
expectations
drinkability
i
do
not
think
this
bomber
will
be
any
task
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
smell
really
makes
it
pleasant
the
taste
is
good
but
i
have
had
much
better
breakfast
beers
in
terms
of
drinkability
the
price
also
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
swallow
all
around
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
a
very
nice
beer
which
i
would
be
glad
to
buy
again
pitch
black
beer
with
lots
of
dense
brown
head
that
persists
with
good
lacing
on
the
glass
bread
and
malt
aromas
some
chocolate
as
well
coffee
comes
through
at
the
end
smooth
and
rich
not
overly
roasted
hints
of
dark
fruit
flavor
is
chocolate
up
front
with
plenty
of
malts
again
not
highly
roasted
but
rather
a
very
subtle
but
definite
coffee
flavor
a
touch
of
anise
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
lingering
bitterness
and
the
slightest
of
alcohol
burn
thick
rich
chewy
texture
as
expected
from
a
huge
oatmeal
stout
dr
far
too
expensive
but
very
good
d
this
is
a
heavyweight
no
doubt
but
still
drinkable
its
acidity
however
makes
it
so
i
could
probably
only
tolerate
one
or
two
that
said
i
love
smokey
beers
so
i
quite
fancied
this
one
but
i
think
i
will
stick
with
something
a
bit
easier
on
the
stomach
a
solid
stout
but
ive
had
better
overall
its
a
good
beer
light
in
abv
for
a
stout
but
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
i
would
definitely
take
other
easier
to
obtain
cheaper
to
purchase
stouts
over
this
though
i
searched
long
and
hard
for
this
one
so
although
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
that
i
was
expecting
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
its
expensive
d
too
much
bitter
coffee
for
me
to
drink
too
much
of
it
also
9
a
500ml
no
thanks
much
rather
havee
a
4pack
of
fbs
for
a
bit
more
d
at
first
this
brew
just
comes
off
as
all
coffee
and
roasted
maltbut
it
really
shines
as
it
warms
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
as
well
as
one
of
the
originalshappy
to
finally
try
this
brew
as
dark
as
a
windowless
unlit
room
huge
fluffy
chocolate
and
caramel
colored
head
very
possibly
the
most
impressive
head
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
it
looks
like
a
layered
chocolate
and
caramel
cake
wonderful
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
oats
id
love
to
smell
this
beer
first
thing
every
morning
the
coffee
is
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
but
its
still
there
flavor
is
rich
in
roasted
grains
bitter
chocolate
molassas
vanilla
and
the
forementioned
coffee
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
a
soft
carbination
easy
to
drink
now
this
is
how
i
like
my
stouts
for
me
this
one
shines
in
its
appearance
i
just
love
pouring
it
into
my
glass
and
staring
at
the
creamy
head
as
it
slowly
dissolves
nicely
done
really
enjoyed
this
one
poured
as
black
as
night
with
little
to
no
light
being
able
to
penetrate
inch
or
so
of
nice
tan
head
that
left
a
sticky
web
of
goodness
on
my
duvel
tulip
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
up
front
turning
to
sweet
bitter
dark
chocolate
as
it
settles
accross
my
tongue
my
mouth
and
tongue
are
very
happy
and
reluctant
to
share
with
my
throat
and
stomach
glad
this
is
fairly
available
to
me
because
i
have
it
in
my
stout
rotation
and
i
dont
see
it
going
anywhere
soon
d
this
beer
was
delicious
and
very
enjoyable
great
abv
and
almost
perfect
stout
d
very
enjoyable
great
sipper
not
because
of
abv
but
because
of
the
richness
of
flavor
served

d
nice
brew
nice
aromas
and
flavor
creamy
and
smooth
drinkability
ill
pass
but
at
least
it
wasnt
painful
to
try
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
not
too
heavy
while
still
having
a
great
taste
to
come
back
to
the
abv
is
a
bit
hidden
and
would
like
to
have
seen
it
a
bit
higher
for
the
style
i
would
come
back
to
this
brew
but
i
feel
that
there
are
other
benchmarks
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
nice
mix
between
a
huge
dessert
beer
and
more
of
a
regular
drinker
albeit
a
higher
alcohol
one
i
would
not
immediately
reach
for
a
second
one
but
could
see
drinking
this
again
depending
on
the
price
i
dont
love
this
but
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
overall
amazing
beer
delicious
wasnt
heavy
at
all
i
had
a
couple
beer
at
mikkelller
that
i
didnt
review
but
i
really
loved
great
phantom
brewery
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
complex
flavor
it
hides
the
7
5
abv
well
overall
im
really
impressed
by
this
beer
i
really
love
it
if
mikkellers
other
stuff
approaches
this
hes
pretty
hard
to
beat
believe
the
hype
on
this
one
and
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
it
up
you
wont
regret
it
d
the
beer
goes
down
rather
easily
because
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
nose
is
really
nice
with
a
strong
odor
of
freshroasted
coffee
along
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
while
the
latter
is
there
the
coffee
is
definitely
on
the
center
stage
and
is
quite
tasty
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
i
could
use
more
depth
but
the
coffee
definitely
gets
this
up
to
a
4
0
nice
slightly
bitter
and
roasted
feel
a
really
nice
coffee
brew
despite
not
having
any
flaws
and
turning
out
exactly
as
intended
i
have
to
say
im
not
a
big
fan
drinkability
suffered
for
me
due
to
the
lack
of
subtlety
in
the
flavors
still
that
takes
nothing
away
from
the
execution
of
this
beer
a
decent
enough
amerikansk
ale
or
whatever
but
in
the
end
on
the
weaker
side
of
yankeestyle
imperial
stouts
maybe
i
should
actually
have
had
it
with
breakfast
drinkability
the
deft
touch
of
the
brewer
here
is
what
i
think
is
most
striking
about
this
beer
its
remarkable
how
he
achieved
this
balance
with
such
big
players
its
more
like
writing
a
symphony
than
brewing
a
beer
but
however
he
approached
it
he
ended
up
with
an
amazing
offering
in
a
most
unusual
interpretation
of
the
style
this
is
nothing
like
youve
ever
had
before
and
most
likely
will
never
find
again
so
dont
miss
an
opportunity
to
check
this
out
500
ml
bottle
mikkeller
label
printed
with
picture
of

i
like
the
gypsy
brewer
approach
that
this
danish
school
teacher
is
taking
pitch
black
hue
in
the
body
absolutely
captures
all
bands
of
the
visible
light
spectrum
dark

mocha

visually
all
appealing
as
i
pour
it
into
my
dfh
chalice
fine
layers
of
delicate
detailed
lacing
match
so
well
with
the
style
aroma
has
layers
of
creamy
dark
chocolate
with
slightly
acidic
big
dark
coffee
roasts
earthy
herbal
slightly
woody
coffee
roasts
flavor
is
the
closest
to
a
dark
cup
of
good
coffee
ive
come
to
know
the
acidity
really
captures
the
essence
of
a
nice
cup
of
strong
coffee
creamy
edges
dark
chocolate
blends
hints
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
the
american
hops
used
provide
herbal
earth
notes
in
the
background
this
is
nice
well
made
coffee
stout
mouthfeel
has
dry
dark
roasts
with
bitey
hints
of
acidity
carbonation
is
upfront
sturdy
but
not
overdone
fuller
bodied
but
not
too
thick
or
cloying
drinkability
this
stuff
is
tasting
fantastic
true
coffee
beer
experience
here
i
hope
to
find
more
of
the
mikkeller
offerings
i
have
avoided
them
since
i
really
didnt
care
for
their
barleywine
i
tried
awhile
back
their
nogne
o
connection
is
working
for
quality
control
so
i
will
probably
be
trying
more
mikkeller
ales
mikkeller
demands
a
few
extra
bucks
for
their
beers
than
they
are
worth
when
compared
to
domestics
but
this
is
one
of
their
beers
that
you
should
seek
out
and
just
say
screw
the
price
though
at
about
9
a
bomber
it
certainly
isnt
out
of
line
with
many
of
the
over
priced
american
brewers
out
there
if
youre
going
to
judge
mikkeller
and
youve
supply
is
a
bit
limited
they
have
some
better
rated
stuff
i
havent
seen
judge
them
based
on
this
this
is
a
truly
amazing
brew
very
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
for
such
a
rich
feeling
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
glass
of
this
can
easily
replace
someones
morning
cup
of
french
press
coffee
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
long
lingering
coffee
flavor
the
booze
is
barely
noticeable
i
found
this
to
be
rather
drinkable
due
to
the
lighter
body
for
the
style
a
solid
take
on
the
style
and
definitely
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
a
great
beer
actually
had
this
one
with
breakfast
and
it
worked
well
d
wonderful
but
nearly
too
much
would
have
trouble
pairing
this
good
thing
this
is
breakfast
not
a
drink
to
have
with
breakfast
d
definitely
a
solid
coffee
stout
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
considering
the
rave
reviews
i
had
read
about
prior
somewhat
let
down
on
this
one
mouthfeeldrinkability
full
and
thick
body
but
still
creamy
the
oats
really
help
balance
this
beer
out
and
make
it
very
smooth
at
7
5
abv
the
alcohol
isnt
out
of
control
and
i
cant
really
taste
it
at
all
bgb
is
fairly
pricey
but
if
you
feel
like
springing
for
it
its
definitely
worth
a
try
d
pretty
high
not
too
boozy
great
feel
and
an
overall
wellexecuted
coffee
stout
the
oatmeal
gives
it
much
better
balance
than
say
black
hole
from
this
same
brewer
d
this
brewer
comes
with
much
hype
little
disappointed
this
is
simply
an
exceptional
brew
i
cant
say
that
ive
had
many
that
i
like
better
d
probably
just
one
d
not
as
thick
and
full
as
some
other
stouts
dangerously
drinkable
one
of
the
better
mikkellers
ive
had
one
of
the
better
imp
stouts
ive
had
as
well
dynomite
since
this
comes
in
a
5ooml
bottle
its
a
little
too
filling
to
have
very
many
of
these
at
one
sitting
but
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
as
a
single
notes
very
smooth
very
drinkable
excellent
beer
the
flavor
is
thick
and
roasty
tons
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
are
in
the
flavor
there
is
surprisingly
little
malt
to
compete
with
the
bitterness
there
is
a
light
bit
of
tartness
and
chocolate
it
isnt
as
good
as
the
variations
that
came
out
of
it
but
it
is
solid
d
very
drinkable
beer
flavors
are
delicious
and
work
well
together
but
are
never
overpowering
or
exhausting
definitely
a
good
starting
point
if
youre
trying
to
get
into
coffee
stouts
d
i
found
this
rather
unpleasant
and
all
around
out
of
whack
too
bitter
too
carbonated
not
enough
flavor
i
would
expect
more
from
mikkeller
poured
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
smells
like
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
i
would
of
sworn
there
was
cinnamon
in
this
as
its
a
very
dominant
flavor
medium
carbonation
alcohol
slightly
evident
taste
even
better
as
it
warms
this
is
smooth
sweet
and
very
drinkable
d
its
seems
like
more
coffee
than
beer
but
all
the
aspect
of
a
fine
imperial
stout
are
present
the
7
5
abv
goes
unnoticed
and
the
marriage
of
malty
stout
flavours
with
bitter
coffee
is
fantastic
beer
and
coffee
geeks
alike
should
try
this
i
would
say
that
this
has
average
drinkability
but
im
bumping
it
up
for
the
name
and
appearance
beer
geek
breakfast
pairs
well
with
chocolate
the
darker
the
better
ghirardelis
intense
dark
is
a
perfect
choice
pours
thick
and
black
brown
head
big
smells
of
coffee
perfect
mouth
feel
for
a
stout
pure
amazing
taste
it
became
my
favorite
stout
thick
sweet
malty
flavors
extreme
amounts
of
coffee
easily
better
than
any
other
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
loved
it
d
i
dont
know
about
having
this
for
breakfast
as
the
name
and
label
implies
but
it
makes
a
great
end
of
the
night
sipping
beer
or
a
fine
beer
to
have
with
a
chocolate
desert
im
not
typically
keen
on
coffee
flavors
but
the
coffee
in
this
is
quite
mellow
and
not
overpowering
bringing
out
additional
flavors
d
im
glad
i
finally
was
able
to
try
this
although
i
did
not
have
it
for
breakfast
but
i
could
see
that
happening
a
great
stout
with
excellent
roasted
notes
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
and
some
sweetness
d
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
both
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
my
first
experience
was
at
seattle
international
beerfest
by
the
space
needle
and
i
tried
another
actually
for
breakfast
this
was
breakfast
for
dinner
i
guess
since
i
had
it
after
work
this
is
so
satisfying
and
it
lives
up
to
the
name
it
is
refreshing
like
a
cold
coffee
and
still
fills
the
stout
craving
if
you
like
coffee
in
beer
you
have
to
try
this
d
really
nice
i
drank
this
with
breakfast
never
too
early
for
a
breakfast
beer
very
tasty
and
went
down
easy
this
beer
geek
did
have
this
for
breakfast
1030am
and
im
not
sure
if
that
helped
its
cause
but
when
alls
said
and
done
this
one
didnt
need
much
help
great
beer
and
you
should
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
such
a
well
balanced
drinkable
beer
i
definitely
got
more
than
i
had
bargained
for
drinkability
so
ive
had
this
waiting
in
my
cellar
ie
dark
pantry
for
almost
a
year
and
decided
to
a
have
a
liquid
breakfast
and
boy
am
i
glad
i
did
this
is
the
sort
of
breakfast
i
would
never
skip
the
mikkeller
boys
have
done
it
once
again
just
glad
i
bought
two
of
these
so
i
can
enjoy
this
again
the
second
time
around
if
your
a
stout
fan
get
your
hands
on
this
now
highly
recommended
drinks
like
breakfast
i
am
admittedly
a
big
fan
of
coffee
stouts
and
beer
geek
breakfast
ranks
up
there
with
my
favorites
nom
the
most
amazing
aspect
of
this
beer
is
how
it
drops
off
immediately
after
savoring
a
mouth
full
of
magic
it
gently
rolls
off
the
back
of
the
tongue
leaving
not
alcohol
nor
residual
sweetness
ghostly
i
was
most
impressed
with
this
as
my
tongue
never
got
worn
out
or
tired
probably
the
most
drinkable
strong
stout
ive
had
extremely
wellbalanced
and
palatable
d
overall
im
rather
enjoying
this
really
smooth
despite
the
almost
overwhelming
smokiness
and
bitterness
good
but
not
quite
as
worldclass
as
i
had
hoped
there
isnt
really
much
carbonation
going
on
but
the
contrast
of
the
very
persistent
head
and
smooth
full
body
of
the
beer
itself
is
fantastic
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
i
would
drink
it
much
more
often
it
were
more
widely
available
and
lower
price
point
but
its
really
not
overpriced
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
creamy
carbonation
but
a
little
too
high
for
me
very
thick
body
500ml
bottle
pours
black
with
a
very
dark
brown
head
roasty
aroma
with
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
has
loads
of
espresso
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
mediumheavy
bodied
and
a
good
bitter
finish
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
at
only
7
5
this
is
very
drinkable
for
an
imperial
stout
great
beer
this
is
a
musttry
if
you
are
a
coffee
lover
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
brew
and
in
fact
cracked
it
open
and
shared
it
with
a
few
friends
the
color
is
black
and
that
is
it
the
smell
was
very
strong
alcohol
was
the
main
thing
we
all
smelled
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
heavy
on
the
alcohol
in
the
front
followed
by
a
big
dose
of
coffee
flavor
and
lastly
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
although
at
7
5
i
could
really
taste
the
alcohol
and
for
me
it
was
not
that
enjoyable
i
will
give
this
beer
another
try
later
on
and
will
see
if
my
opinion
changes
d
everything
goes
together
nicely
black
with
a
coffeeandcream
head
smokey
roasted
malts
and
coffee
in
the
nose
bitter
roasted
malts
slight
smokiness
and
strong
coffee
flavours
quite
bitter
but
i
think
typical
of
an
american
double
stout
a
good
after
dinner
sipper
good
with
dark
chocolate
or
maybe
stilton
the
carbonation
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
less
not
bad
it
could
stand
up
against
a
real
american
ds
notes
just
a
little
to
rough
and
rugged
for
me
to
really
enjoy
d
not
for
me
very
roasty
and
burt
but
lacking
a
finer
balance
drinkability
moderate
its
a
very
good
beer
with
nice
and
deep
flavors
and
scents
definitely
sits
a
bit
heavy
but
the
abv
isnt
overwhelming
would
make
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
i
wish
this
were
my
breakfast
it
pours
a
straight
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
a
little
over
a
finger
of
burnt
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
a
healthy
dose
of
cofee
some
darkly
roasted
malts
and
some
burnt
caramel
i
was
kinda
hoping
for
more
shall
we
say
variety
but
whats
there
works
and
smells
good
thats
all
ya
really
need
people
the
taste
tones
the
coffee
down
a
ways
allowing
the
roasted
malts
to
come
through
a
bit
better
the
caramel
is
now
a
complete
pile
of
cinders
as
though
twere
left
on
the
cast
iron
griddle
a
touch
too
long
so
basically
this
thing
tastes
of
coffee
and
overly
cookedburnt
grains
and
sugars
it
still
tastes
alright
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
especially
after
brunch
i
know
breakfast
after
brunch
sounds
goofy
but
dammit
i
havent
slept
normally
in
some
time
so
go
to
hell
now
maybe
if
the
coffee
was
shit
out
by
some
sort
of
stoat
or
varmint
the
body
is
a
light
heavy
with
a
sorta
moderate
carbonation
and
a
straightforward
feel
and
finish
overall
its
not
a
bad
stout
just
nothing
in
any
way
all
that
special
even
in
the
realm
of
coffee
stouts
taste
is
nice
and
roasty
with
lots
of
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
on
the
finish
the
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
youd
expect
but
it
makes
it
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
low
which
is
perfect
d
as
far
as
bold
and
assertive
imperial
stouts
go
the
bgb
is
much
more
drinkable
than
most
other
stouts
making
waves
i
applaud
mikkeller
for
keeping
the
abv
at
a
mere
7
5
o
this
is
a
solidly
aboveaverage
offering
overall
although
ive
had
others
that
i
would
reach
for
first
if
considering
a
beer
for
breakfast
factoring
in
the
price
only
makes
it
worse
this
is
a
pretty
expensive
500ml
bottle
at
around
10
for
that
i
can
get
4packs
of
its
competitors
but
thats
the
price
of
drinking
imports
i
guess
this
is
a
good
imperial
stout
and
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
though
i
feel
there
are
probably
less
expensive
options
for
close
to
the
same
quality
d
incredibly
bitter
not
what
i
want
in
this
style
would
not
pick
up
this
brew
again
d
drinkable
good
flavor
and
smell
mouthfeel
for
me
was
kind
of
lacking
its
a
good
stout
just
not
an
amazin
one
good
beer
for
breakfast
as
this
one
was
sampled
in
the
morning
appearance
is
very
black
but
not
jet
black
there
is
a
huge
delicious
looking
chocolatey
head
on
this
beer
very
strong
chocolate
aromas
come
off
of
this
immediately
i
think
the
chocolate
is
more
overwhelming
than
the
coffee
i
also
get
a
small
amount
of
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
immediately
hoppy
and
highly
carbonated
not
a
very
great
initial
taste
but
the
chocolate
comes
next
followed
by
a
strong
coffeeespresso
taste
very
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
bodies
but
a
bit
overly
carbonated
imo
the
drinkability
is
fairly
higher
than
most
imperial
stouts
as
it
is
not
as
thick
nor
is
it
as
high
in
alcohol
solid
beer
the
hops
are
very
prominent
and
floral
it
has
a
wonderful
balance
of
flavors
for
a
smoothness
greater
than
most
beer
the
lingering
aftertaste
makes
you
want
more
this
isnt
a
light
beer
in
the
slightest
really
enjoying
and
drinkable
all
of
the
negative
aspects
of
a
coffee
beer
are
absent
from
this
imho
d
i
thought
it
was
decent
but
not
something
id
pay
12
to
pick
up
i
prefer
the

thats

but
weasel
is
better
in
my
opinion
i
feel
like
there
are
too
many
artificial
flavors
happening
in
this
one
no
discernible

taste
very
nice
and
easy
to

a
bit
viscous
and
creamy
pours
a
dark
brown
with
offwhite
head
some
coffee
in
the
nose
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
with
some
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
as
well
taste
is
about
half
way
between
a
coffee
stout
and
an
oatmeal
stout
yet
i
dont
think
it
quite
reached
the
potential
of
either
it
was
bit
thin
in
the
body
had
on
tap
at
stone
i
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
thought
it
was
good
but
very
excited
to
try
on
tap
pours
a
dark
brown
that
allows
some
light
through
with
a
nice
head
nose
is
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
taste
is
more
of
the
same
at
first
and
then
closer
to
room
temp
it
starts
to
bloom
wonderful
cocoa
and
espresso
blend
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
for
an
imperial
so
that
was
the
onl
low
spot
very
tasty
recommended
for
breakfasts
everywhere
d
aside
from
the
fairly
potent
ashy
charcter
this
is
definitely
a
solid
coffee
stout
glad
to
see
this
around
on
tap
as
id
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
quite
a
while
dits
expensive
for
each
bottle
but
its
a
decent
and
well
balanced
double
stout
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
at
7
5
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
you
dont
want
to
pound
one
of
this
bad
boys
back
in
a
few
minutes
because
it
can
really
get
overwhelming
with
the
texture
and
intense
flavors
but
if
it
was
more
readily
available
here
it
would
really
be
a
go
to
in
the
imperial
category
i
am
more
of
an
american
craft
guy
but
this
wasis
a
very
enjoyable
import
will
buy
again
purchased
from
whole
foods
in
sf
ca
on
potrero
hill
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
the
past
few
years
but
for
some
reason
or
another
have
never
gotten
around
to
it
well
today
i
got
around
to
it
and
boy
oh
boy
am
i
glad
i
did
this
beer
is
exceptional
on
all
levels
taste
is
phenomenal
with
a
deep
herb
flavor
followed
by
intense
coffee
tones
the
smell
is
of
equal
stature
it
has
a
very
enticing
herbal
smell
with
strong
molasses
under
tones
the
look
on
this
beer
is
on
another
level
black
as
black
can
be
this
is
easily
a
contender
for
the
darkest
beer
i
have
ever
encountered
and
i
have
seen
some
intensely
dark
beers
in
my
time
over
all
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
will
most
likely
come
back
to
again
and
again
id
say
this
is
the
gourmet
espresso
of
beer
to
the
rich
espresso
truffle
with
chocolate
sauce
that
speedway
is
where
both
give
you
rich
delicious
sensations
but
only
one
leaves
you
room
for
another
delicious
big
thick
robust
beer
bottle
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
using
the
duvel
tulip
glass
the
taste
is
of
bitter
roasted
coffee
with
dark
chocolate
lingering
lots
of
bitter
coffee
flavour
in
this
one
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
you
dont
pick
up
the
7
5
alc
in
any
sip
pretty
good
stout
overall
d
a
little
bitter
for
an
is
in
my
opinion
still
a
good
beer
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
ones
out
there
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
though
an
eminently
wonderful
coffee
stout
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
beer
with
the
dark
coffee
roast
and
chocolate
notes
playing
well
together
while
the
alcohol
is
evident
on
the
nose
it
is
well
integrated
on
the
palate
and
the
whole
thing
is
delicious
d
maybe
this
was
a
bad
bottle
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
this
was
the
first
mikkeller
stout
ive
had
and
i
had
high
hopes
for
it
but
it
kind
of
let
me
down
a
fair
stout
but
nothing
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
i
will
try
another
bottle
sometime
to
make
sure
this
one
wasnt
simply
bad
this
might
just
be
the
darkest
most
black
impenetrable
stout
i
have
ever
had
it
carries
a
mocha
brownish
head
that
is
soft
and
fluffy
and
is
not
going
anywhere
the
only
problem
i
can
see
is
that
there
is
no
way
this
beer
can
taste
as
good
as
it
looks
the
smell
is
loaded
with
aromas
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
chalky
bittersweet
chocolate
the
flavor
is
wonderfully
intense
with
notes
of
roasted
malt
mingling
with
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
unfortunately
this
is
a
wham
bam
thank
you
maam
sort
of
brew
and
the
robust
flavor
quickly
fades
to
just
a
burnt
bitter
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
full
bodied
with
a
nice
smoothness
from
the
oats
but
with
a
finish
that
is
a
tad
dry
for
my
liking
a
robust
beer
but
a
pretty
easy
drinker
that
would
go
great
with
dessert
d
very
drinkable
for
all
that
this
beer
has
going
on
highly
recommended
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
i
couldnt
get
passed
the
burnt
coffee
a
decent
offering
from
mikeller
it
poured
a
nice
dark
black
no
light
showing
through
there
was
a
faint
tan
colored
head
that
dissipated
immediately
the
smell
was
strong
coffee
and
roasted
malts
faint
caramel
this
is
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
ever
had
great
use
of
the
roasted
malts
coffee
and
oatmeal
very
well
balanced
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
with
the
sweetness
of
the
oatmeal
this
beer
isnt
as
heavy
as
id
like
but
its
by
no
means
light
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
covers
the
7
5
very
well
d
this
one
is
rich
for
all
that
implies
id
love
to
have
more
but
i
just
cant
of
course
theres
always
tomorrow
mmmm
ahhh
back
to
the
good
stuff
mikkeller
i
bow
down
great
classic
beer
actually
poured
with
a
large
light
brown
thick
creamy
foamy
frothy
head
that
lasts
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
opaque
brown
black
aroma
is
malt
roast
cocoa
dark
ripe
fruits
yeast
and
a
bit
of
coffee
flavors
like
aroma
and
better
very
well
balanced
excellent
creamy
smooth
body
and
carbonation
superb
finish
that
is
like
flavor
and
ends
up
chocolate
malty
with
a
suggestion
of
alcohol
fabulous
beer
very
easy
drinking
although
more
sipping
than
quaffing
the
mouthfeel
is
much
too
bubbly
and
stiff
for
this
style
but
maybe
thats
what
it
gives
it
its
marvelous
head
this
is
the
only
thing
holding
the
beer
back
a
very
enjoyable
and
eminently
drinkable
brew
which
has
stood
up
well
to
3
years
of
aging
overall
a
classic
mikkeller
brew
that
i
love
having
access
too
two
seconds

if
looking

ther
are

oatmeal
notes
i
have
ever
had
mfd
a
smooth
and
slick
beer
not
very
thick
despite
the
not
as
high
abv
i
should
still
like
to
feel
a
thick
beer
for
the
style
but
nevertheless
the
beer
is
very
good
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
highly
recommended
pours
jet
black
with
brown
edges
viscous
with
an
explosive
head
huge
tan
head
comprised
of
tiny
cascading
bubbles
took
a
while
for
it
to
die
down
so
i
could
pour
the
rest
of
the
bottle
thick
hard
lacing
burnt
black
coffee
nose
along
with
burnt
grains
and
oats
some
cream
and
smoke
as
well
viscous
oily
mouthfeel
with
a
coatinglike
finish
massive
coffee
flavor
bitter
acidic
roasty
biting
anything
black
coffee
is
in
this
beer
oatmealcereal
flavors
are
present
as
well
as
caramel
chocolate
vanilla
and
cream
but
all
are
far
less
in
representation
than
the
coffee
its
a
slow
drinker
but
very
pleasant
as
it
warms
some
have
said
that
this
is
coffee
overload
or
it
is
not
complex
enough
i
disagree
this
says
its
a
coffee
stout
and
it
follows
through
after
trying
beers
from
both
these
breweries
and
hearing
a
bunch
of
rave
reviews
from
friends
i
was
most
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
as
i
definately
have
never
had
a
beer
i
dont
like
from
these
2
the
beer
pours
a
non
see
thur
black
and
looks
almost
like
coca
colamotor
oil
and
smells
very
coffeeish
with
a
typical
beautiful
stout
smell
and
on
pouring
has
a
one
finger
head
with
a
little
lacing
around
the
glass
and
just
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
on
tasting
u
can
taste
the
coffee
and
chocolate
but
not
much
alcohol
taste
at
all
for
a
beer
that
is
7
5this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
once
again
a
beautiful
beer
from
a
great
brewer
d
oh
yes
it
will
be
mine
this
beer
pours
a
thick
used
motor
oil
black
color
the
head
well
just
keeps
growing
even
with
a
soft
pour
of
only
half
the
glass
the
head
deceptively
slowly
rose
up
and
poured
out
of
the
glass
very
annoying
i
like
a
good
head
on
a
beer
but
not
this
much
from
a
stout
the
aroma
is
of
graham
crackers
dark
chocolate
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
grounds
it
is
a
pleasant
aroma
but
i
barely
detect
any
coffee
which
is
really
weak
for
a
so
called
coffee
stout
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
more
pronounced
used
coffee
ground
flavor
not
the
most
pleasant
coffee
presence
ive
encountered
in
a
beer
this
makes
it
a
good
thing
that
most
of
the
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
graham
crackers
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
carbonation
level
the
is
higher
than
more
stouts
but
not
overly
high
the
texture
is
silky
the
mouthfeel
is
by
far
the
aspect
of
this
beer
i
like
most
overall
im
not
sure
what
is
going
on
with
this
beer
it
seems
like
everything
is
as
it
should
be
so
i
guess
this
is
just
one
of
those
beers
that
most
people
like
but
i
dont
i
simply
cant
get
past
that
nasty
used
coffee
flavor
d
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
initial
siip
but
you
notice
it
before
long
principally
because
there
arent
too
many
other
interesting
things
going
on
this
is
a
good
beer
a
fine
representative
of
its
style
but
by
the
end
of
a
bomber
youll
be
quite
ready
to
try
something
else
the
extravagant
price
of
importing
from
norway
makes
it
a
hard
sell
to
revisit
a
solidly
drinkable
and
very
good
but
not
great
coffee
stout
drinkability
a
solid
brew
but
not
worth
the
price
and
all
the
hype
and
my
opinion
and
though
im
not
a
regular
coffee
drinker
i
do
enjoy
it
in
beer
that
said
it
seems
like
the
first
bottle
we
had
wasnt
tainted
because
the
second
had
the
same
qualities
certainly
drink
this
at
room
temperature
to
maximize
the
roasted
flavors
but
even
then
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
i
wonder
if
aging
would
do
anything
maybe
cut
the
bitterness
a
bit
but
at
only
7
5
i
dont
think
that
would
really
do
much
overall
been
thinking
about
trying
this
for
a
long
time
and
finally
put
down
the
11
for
it
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
stout
a
non
aggressive
pour
yields
a
huge
5
finger
light
brown
head
with
serious
lacing
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
with
earthywoody
undertones
even
a
hint
of
sawdust
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
dry
and
bitter
strong
hops
oatmeal
there
is
a
burnt
taste
a
la
blackened
catfish
is
this
a
good
food
pairing
i
wonder
some
french
roast
coffee
and
black
pepper
flavor
comes
in
at
the
end
and
does
linger
in
the
aftertaste
the
bottle
claims
this
is
well
balanced
and
full
bodied
i
find
it
lower
on
malt
than
some
of
my
favorite
stouts
i
find
that
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
watery
for
sure
but
not
real
chewy
there
is
some
creaminess
felt
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
it
is
mostly
a
dry
sipper
drinkability
for
me
would
be
low
alcohol
is
present
despite
only
being
7
5
while
my
review
seems
negative
this
is
a
quality
brew
and
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
this
is
no
beginners
stout
and
even
23
years
ago
i
might
not
have
even
finished
it
my
tastes
are
evolving
and
i
might
revisit
this
some
day
overall
it
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
not
at
all
worth
the
coin
this
reminds
me
somewhat
of
ipswich
stout
mercury
brewing
i
can
get
six
of
those
for
less
money
cha
ching
md
very
smooth
and
creamy
nice
amount
of
coffee
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
abv
is
well
hidden
d
thumbs
up
i
wouldnt
recommend
having
this
with
breakfast
if
you
plan
on
getting
anything
done
that
day
but
its
a
good
one
to
relax
with
d
taste
is
untouchable
but
the
high
alcohol
content
and
the
thick
mouthfeel
limits
the
drinkability
abosutely
all
i
look
for
in
a
ris
this
beer
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
i
finally
found
an
impy
stout
that
is
worth
the
hype
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
down
in
my
cellar
i
wonder
if
i
should
drink
them
now
or
see
if
a
couple
months
might
mellow
the
coffee
even
more
oh
the
possibilites
notes
paired
well
with
a
california
frittata
a
small
piece
of
chocolate
cake
d
this
is
a
great
coffee
stout
with
a
rich
coffee
profile
highly
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
deep
opaque
almost
oil
textured
black
a
good
2
finger
thick
light
brown
head
tops
the
beer
outstanding
head
retention
and
as
it
dissipates
leaves
a
thick
sticky
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
nose
is
very
boozy
up
front
with
a
strong
presence
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
extremely
boozy
until
i
let
it
warm
up
once
warmed
there
was
roasted
caramel
and
toffee
malts
present
chocolate
then
dips
in
and
the
finish
is
of
coffee
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
thick
creamy
somewhat
smooth
save
for
the
alcohol
bitekick
to
it
at
the
end
not
sure
that
i
could
sit
with
it
for
an
entire
evening
as
it
is
heavier
and
the
abv
isnt
all
that
well
hidden
but
its
a
good
enough
beer
that
i
would
sure
the
hell
try
black
as
night
in
color
beer
poured
into
my
kapittel
watou
chalice
forms
a
2
finger
chocolate
colored
head
that
holds
for
a
couple
minutes
ample
lacing
left
as
the
beer
is
drunk
nose
is
pleasant
with
coffee
some
chocolate
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
beer
is
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
and
very
well
balanced
with
just
a
touch
of
roasted
bitterness
in
the
finish
taste
is
chocolate
with
some
malt
and
a
mild
warming
alcohol
this
full
bodied
brew
just
got
better
and
better
as
it
warmed
id
recommend
starting
it
near
room
temp
well
played
mikkeller
well
played
d
i
guess
im
not
really
a
coffee
stout
person
however
i
do
enjoy
founders
breakfast
but
i
wouldnt
turn
someone
away
from
trying
this
beer
guess
just
not
my
bag
russian
imperials
are
more
in
my
interest
i
guess
a
good
beer
i
will
not
be
paying
this
price
again
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
this
beer
is
far
from
the
beer
that
breakfast
stout
is
and
over
twice
as
expensive
three
fingers
of
dark
head
fill
up
the
glass
with
a
jet
black
body
below
i
smell
a
bit
of
soy
with
a
bunch
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
the
soy
is
a
bit
distracting
tastes
great
with
strong
maltiness
and
a
heavy
coffee
bitter
tons
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
with
hints
of
caramel
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
aftertaste
is
dominated
by
a
black
roasted
coffee
goodness
again
the
soysodium
characteristic
is
there
which
is
the
only
quality
i
dont
love
about
the
taste
very
well
carbonated
with
a
strong
full
body
pours
a
completely
opaque
black
and
a
decent
sized
chocolate
head
almost
no
lacing
along
the
glass
dark
fruits
dominate
the
smell
along
with
some
coffee
and
spices
i
can
also
notice
some
raisins
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
mellow
than
the
smell
dark
chocolate
flavors
dominate
with
some
coffee
initially
followed
by
a
sweeter
finish
the
body
is
medium
with
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
the
carbonation
may
take
a
little
away
from
the
taste
fairly
tame
for
a
coffee
stout
or
an
imperial
stout
yet
still
pleasant
with
no
discernable
flaws
id
never
turn
it
down
for
breakfast
though
more
harsh
read
bitter
than
the
smell
would
indicate
lots
of
black
patent
flavor
tastes
like
an
iced
coffee
with
cream
decent
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
for
balance
creamy
this
could
be
the
closest
thing
to
a
perfect
stout
above
average
drinkability
one
is
enough
in
a
night
would
have
again
if
it
were
cheaper
a
good
beer
thats
only
off
on
moutfeel
and
viscosity
for
an
imperial
stout
too
thin
and
weak
this
is
a
big
beer
black
in
color
with
a
thick
cafeaulait
head
it
had
a
wonderful
aroma
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
cereal
mostly
an
espresso
taste
faint
chocolate
i
think
its
pretty
fullbodied
and
filling
great
beer
one
that
i
will
want
to
try
again
even
with
the
hefty
price
tag
a
must
try
for
any
coffee
drinking
stout
fan
unfortunately
me
not
being
a
coffee
drinker
i
found
this
to
be
too
bitter
and
unbalanced
amazing
smell
and
great
appearance
save
this
beer
from
a
pretty
average
score
excellent
choice
dark
in
appearance
really
dark
frothy
foam
upon
pouring
but
it
settles
into
a
micro
film
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
kinda
like
ice
cream
that
has
melted
on
the
counter
before
you
take
a
spoonful
mmm
the
roasted
oats
and
beans
are
very
profound
if
you
watch
the
beer
pour
from
the
bottle
it
kinda
looks
like
milk
chocolate
i
think
the
norwegians
got
this
one
right
drinkability
i
think
this
one
bottle
will
do
nicely
for
me
it
has
all
the
right
tastes
and
the
7
abv
provides
a
nice
warming
sensation
while
not
smacking
you
across
the
face
i
dont
think
this
could
ever
be
a
sessionable
beer
nor
do
i
think
it
was
ever
meant
to
be
at
its
current
price
this
beer
will
become
one
of
those
once
in
a
while
beers
for
me
drinkability
as
it
begins
to
really
hit
its
stride
upon
some
very
slight
warming
the
beer
goes
down
unusually
easy
it
is
very
impressive
yes
recommended
for
a
highly
flavored
beer
with
viscosity
on
the
heavy
side
not
syrupy
though
it
makes
for
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
a
very
good
beer
but
there
are
certainly
better
by
all
means
check
this
out
cheers
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
rich
black
color
with
a
nice
dark
brown
head
the
nose
of
this
beer
contains
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
these
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
along
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
and
a
decent
bitterness
the
taste
stays
on
your
pallet
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
i
would
have
more
of
these
any
night
if
i
had
unlimited
funds
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
evened
out
a
bit
by
a
high
level
of
hopping
the
abv
is
nice
and
low
not
anywhere
near
a
session
beer
but
absolutely
beautiful
and
a
joy
to
drink
drinkability
really
solid
brew
here
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
the
flavors
are
all
really
big
and
work
really
well
together
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
coffee
brews
that
arent
dominated
by
coffee
which
is
how
id
rather
have
them
good
stuff
and
i
finally
found
a
mikkeller
brew
worth
the
money
thanks
for
introducing
matt
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stoutflavorful
not
too
filling
lightly
carbonated
easy
in
the
mouth
not
too
thick
but
with
some
substance
feel
and
drinkability
lighter
in
body
with
higher
carbonation
than
the
others
not
heavy
or
thick
feeling
yet
satisyfing
all
the
same
it
fits
with
what
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
easier
to
drink
than
some
of
the
bigger
brews
in
this
tasting
good
mouthfeel
not
overly
syrupy
but
just
viscous
enough
for
the
style
it
is
does
lean
towards
the
sweeter
side
of
riss
chocolate
is
more
evident
than
the
coffee
would
have
preferred
some
more
roasted
bitterness
but
the
smoothness
of
it
makes
up
for
it
this
one
has
no
alcohol
heat
or
flavor
at
all
its
quite
drinkable
the
richness
of
it
would
probably
keep
you
from
downing
more
than
one
or
two
though
drinakability
is
good
there
is
no
heat
to
this
anywhere
the
aroma
is
like
chocolate
milk
with
coffee
and
toasted
malt
the
appearance
is
black
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
astringent
the
palate
is
a
tad
bit
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
overall
this
is
good
but
not
as
good
tasting
as
it
is
smelling
multifaceted
and
definitely
big
on
flavor
this
ones
a
serious
beer
for
lovers
of
the
style
an
imperial
stout
drinkers
imperial
stout
its
definitely
like
pouring
a
good
stout
into
a
cup
of
coffee
rather
than
the
other
way
around
definitely
a
beer
for
coffee
lovers
a
bit
of
a
warning
you
might
want
to
take
your
time
with
this
and
if
youre
sensitive
to
caffeine
you
might
want
to
avoid
it
it
could
use
more
creaminess
but
regardless
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
a
decent
way
for
a
beer
geek
to
wake
up
worth
a
try
d
didnt
particularly
care
for
the
coffee
flavor
that
comes
across
just
didnt
think
this
balanced
the
coffee
and
the
sweet
very
well
not
a
mindblowing
brew
but
it
is
a
very
good
one
creamy
smooth
just
the
right
to
ease
my
way
into
the
day
if
this
beer
could
find
its
way
to
my
breakfast
table
every
day
i
would
not
complain
the
brew
is
creamy
indeed
with
a
smooth
rich
mouthfeel
coffee
flavor
abounds
of
course
with
a
licorice
bit
clinging
to
the
back
of
the
throat
thats
not
sticky
or
strong
as
in
other
coffee
beers
as
for
drinkability
its
a
divine
beer
best
for
after
dinner
as
a
dessert
drinkable
hells
yes
enjoyable
youd
better
believe
it
a
must
try
impy
stout
overall
i
am
very
happy
with
this
beer
it
cost
me
a
lot
to
buy
this
since
it
is
expensive
already
plus
i
had
to
have
it
shipped
from
out
of
state
so
i
would
not
get
it
very
often
but
if
i
had
it
readily
available
in
my
home
state
i
would
definitely
keep
this
one
around
drinkability
is
good
this
one
is
all
about
the
coffee
and
chocolate
almost
to
the
detriment
of
the
rest
i
think
this
could
use
a
bit
less
bitterness
and
to
be
bumped
up
to
about
10
its
certainly
good
but
i
think
it
could
be
truly
exceptional
having
had
the
brunch
i
think
its
the
refinement
and
improvement
i
was
looking
for
in
this
beer
breakfast
is
good
but
brunch
is
even
better
beer
geek
breakfast
is
very
good
beer
overall
its
impressive
i
love
coffee
infused
stouts
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
the
body
could
stand
to
be
a
little
thicker
and
carbonation
should
be
dialed
down
a
tad
but
theres
a
ton
of
great
flavor
here
and
much
to
love
definitely
recommended
if
youre
into
coffeeespresso
flavored
stouts
with
some
other
coffee
oatmeal
imperials
around
here
in
easy
supply
i
dont
think
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
this
one
but
it
is
a
damn
good
drink
conclusion
scone
please
original
review
one
of
the
darkest
streams
of
liquid
i
have
ever
seen
splashes
into
my
glass
and
kicks
up
a
huge
mocha
coloured
head
which
takes
a
long
time
to
dissipate
to
a
finger
of
foam
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
way
held
up
to
the
light
the
beer
is
not
as
black
as
it
originally
appeared
and
veers
more
towards
dark
chocolate
colour
the
aroma
is
full
on
espresso
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
flavour
is
high
on
the
coffee
and
lacks
the
balance
of
peche
mortel
i
can
sense
some
really
good
roasted
malts
and
stout
characteristics
but
the
espresso
flavour
is
perhaps
a
little
too
dominant
nonetheless
a
damn
solid
stout
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
hits
hard
in
the
first
sip
but
mellows
out
once
the
palate
is
used
to
it
allowing
some
of
the
malts
and
bitter
chocolate
to
peek
through
i
feel
there
is
something
lacking
though
and
it
could
do
with
a
creaminess
or
caramel
flavour
to
offset
the
bitterness
of
the
espresso
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
part
due
to
the
presence
of
very
fine
granules
of
coffee
and
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
a
tough
one
to
measure
its
decent
but
something
i
find
hard
to
drink
unless
its
slowly
over
the
course
of
an
evening
decent
but
in
my
opinion
a
bit
overrated
appearance
a
mouth
feel
is
a
heavy
body
and
creamy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
very
heavy
the
finish
is
longing
and
lasting
with
bitter
this
beer
is
freakin
awesome
the
beer
had
a
nice
body
rich
in
flavor
and
overall
very
easy
to
drink
there
is
not
much
else
to
say
but
i
need
another
one
overall
like
drinking
iced
black
coffee
in
beer
form
overall
on
taste
i
wouldnt
rank
it
with
the
best
among
similar
styles
but
its
relatively
low
alcohol
compared
to
other
imperials
this
is
by
no
means
a
session
brew
enable
you
drink
more
than
one
without
being
hammered
and
thats
a
good
thing
this
is
a
good
coffee
stout
this
did
not
impress
me
as
much
as
founders
breakfast
stout
though
there
seems
to
be
more
subtle
flavors
in
the
fbs
than
this
though
i
still
have
a
few
bottles
of
both
and
will
do
a
side
by
side
for
comparison
motor
oil
black
with
a
three
to
four
finger
mocha
head
tons
of
lacing
and
small
bubble
carbonation
look
very
promising
ditto
with
the
smell
a
nice
latte
malted
milk
chocolate
smell
with
sweetness
and
nicely
understated
espresso
aroma
the
taste
is
comprised
of
a
roast
coffee
first
impression
that
is
quite
nice
but
then
it
takes
a
turn
for
the
worst
with
a
harsh
middle
and
an
astringent
too
dry
cloying
finish
and
aftertaste
that
seem
strangely
out
of
place
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
burnt
coffee
drunk
cold
coarse
and
abrupt
but
with
a
sandlike
quality
gritty
and
not
very
pleasant
too
bad
about
that
it
started
out
quite
well
and
kind
of
went
downhill
after
that
this
is
like
a
jekyll
and
hyde
stout
that
shows
much
promise
to
begin
with
and
then
takes
on
a
different
personality
well
worth
trying
but
it
could
be
much
better
was
my
impression
drinkabiility
is
pretty
good
for
a
stout
at
7
5
you
can
still
have
other
beers
or
carry
on
other
activities
without
feeling
woozy
also
the
mouthfeel
helps
it
go
down
easier
than
other
stouts
i
had
a
full
bomber
by
myself
and
it
wasnt
a
problem
finishing
it
if
you
proceed
at
a
leisurely
pace
overall
beer
geek
breakfast
is
without
a
doubt
the
most
appropriate
name
for
this
beer
if
you
are
any
sort
of
a
stout
andor
strong
coffee
lover
you
will
not
be
let
down
by
this
brew
one
thing
i
can
assure
you
of
is
that
the
next
time
i
open
one
of
these
beers
its
going
to
be
breakfast
for
dinner
at
my
house
do
after
the
pour
and
smell
i
had
great
hopes
that
this
beer
would
follow
through
where
it
counted
but
i
was
let
down
a
bit
by
the
overwhelming
bitterness
and
intense
espresso
flavor
without
much
of
the
traditional
rich
stout
flavors
to
balance
it
out
this
was
a
bit
onedimensional
for
my
tastes
though
i
was
surprised
by
the
intensity
of
the
coffee
after
about
10
months
in
the
cellar
the
mealy
grainy
mouthfeel
negatively
impacted
drinkability
for
me
really
a
tough
beer
to
pair
food
with
as
its
likely
to
overpower
whatever
you
drink
it
with
somehow
i
dont
think
this
was
what
jim
morrison
had
in
mind
when
he
sang
woke
up
this
morning
and
i
got
myself
a
beer
but
it
very
well
might
have
been
had
he
lived
to
see
the
growth
and
ingenuity
of
denmarks
micro
breweries
i
wouldnt
say
you
have
to
be
a
coffee
drinker
to
enjoy
the
beer
geek
breakfast
but
im
certain
it
would
help
some
i
myself
am
not
and
i
find
the
beer
a
little
onedimensional
for
my
palate
that
being
said
breakfast
is
the
most
important
meal
of
the
day
and
im
not
one
to
skip
it
notes
the
tastiness
of
this
beer
makes
up
for
the
meaty
grainy
abomination
that
was
its
alright
so
me
and
mikkeller
are
cool
like
that
now
d
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
extremely
drinkable
stout
smooth
carbonation
is
medium
high
silky
and
creamy
d
this
was
a
surprisingly
easydrinking
brew
i
expected
it
to
be
more
potent
it
was
very
taste
and
worth
trying
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
but
i
probably
would
not
buy
it
again
at
this
price
10500
ml
actually
a
bit
less
chewy
than
i
had
expected
but
awesome
none
the
less
edit
i
think
it
bears
noting
that
this
was
a
feb
07
bottle
so
a
couplefew
years
on
er
and
there
was
some
serious
chunkyness
left
in
the
glass
and
the
bottle
after
id
finished
d
outstanding
no
problem
pouring
a
pair
of
these
tasty
treats
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
takes
forever
to
dissipate
lots
of
carbonation
at
work
here
smells
of
chocolate
and
oatmeal
and
coffee
what
would
breakfast
be
without
those
right
a
little
milk
chocolate
and
licorice
in
there
as
well
taste
is
coffee
and
chocolate
slight
ash
a
bit
of
alcohol
with
a
lingering
roast
bitterness
in
the
finish
body
is
solid
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
wow
thats
a
great
stout
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
traded
so
many
of
these
away
this
ones
not
to
heavy
on
the
coffee
like
a
lot
of
breakfast
stouts
want
to
do
these
days
if
it
were
a
little
less
expensive
id
drink
more
of
these
its
ok
but
really
not
worth
the
price
d
another
solid
beer
from
mikkeller
not
a
bad
coffee
stout
but
not
the
best
ive
had
one
thing
that
is
nice
is
that
its
a
manageable
7
5
and
not
something
too
over
the
top
like
the
black
stout
they
brew
which
is
waaay
too
intense
a
drinkable
beer
in
the
imperial
stout
style
and
does
not
overdo
the
alcohol
however
towards
the
end
the
bitter
aftertaste
does
get
to
me
it
is
a
metallicpeppery
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
cloying
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
seems
pretty
well
balanced
between
malts
grains
no
one
flavor
seems
to
overpower
the
others
carbonation
has
a
bit
more
bite
than
most
imperial
stouts
ive
had
slightly
chewy
but
i
dont
find
this
to
be
all
that
rich
and
i
wouldnt
describe
this
as
particularly
creamy
or
velvety
i
think
my
only
real
complaint
though
is
that
head
was
somewhat
excessive
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
be
willing
to
try
again
mouth
is
thick
and
viscous
oily
and
rich
drinks
easy
and
leaves
you
with
a
i
must
have
more
feeling
great
job
mikkeller
deasy
to
drink
but
something
i
would
like
to
keep
around
for
when
the
need
hits
drinkability
this
beer
looks
like
coffee
smells
like
coffee
tastes
like
coffee
but
guess
what
brother
it
isnt
coffee
its
another
one
of
those
beers
where
the
only
thing
that
truly
hurts
it
is
the
hefty
sticker
price
theres
no
doubt
about
its
expensive
as
hell
do
you
get
your
moneys
worth
im
just
going
to
say
that
there
are
slightly
better
and
cheaper
coffee
stout
alternatives
out
there
if
you
got
money
burning
a
hole
in
your
pocket
then
go
ahead
and
give
this
beer
a
shot
pours
black
with
a
nice
thick
brown
head
it
stays
around
in
fluffy
clouds
and
you
get
a
decent
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
seems
a
bit
lacking
theres
not
a
strong
coffee
aroma
actually
hardly
any
at
all
on
my
end
at
least
compared
to
the
others
ive
tried
there
is
kind
of
a
fruity
smell
kind
of
like
floral
hops
or
even
a
tiny
bit
of
ester
the
sweet
oatmeal
comes
through
in
the
taste
theres
also
a
coffee
and
dark
malt
bitterness
i
can
even
taste
a
bit
f
hoppiness
like
a
faint
taste
of
grass
clippings
its
actually
a
very
complex
and
nice
tasting
beer
though
i
think
a
bit
more
deep
malty
sweetness
with
the
slight
floral
taste
dialed
down
could
make
it
better
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
firstly
theres
so
much
to
seek
out
but
its
not
astringent
at
allwell
balanced
no
alcohol
harshness
the
only
thing
that
gets
me
is
a
little
bit
of
slickness
this
one
gets
to
me
quickly
its
not
too
tough
to
drink
though
i
dont
think
its
easy
but
i
wouldnt
dare
to
reach
for
a
second
one
whole
500ml
bottle
might
push
it
a
bit
pours
a
motor
oil
black
color
with
some
reddishbrown
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
large
brown
head
rests
a
top
the
brew
the
nose
has
one
of
the
most
outright
aromas
of
coffee
beans
ive
ever
smelled
in
a
beer
before
malty
goodness
all
around
beer
geek
breakfast
booms
with
flavor
right
from
the
get
go
notes
of
burnt
chocolate
semi
sweet
dark
malt
and
a
bitter
coffee
bean
finish
roasty
but
smooth
as
all
hell
the
beer
lays
on
the
lighter
side
of
full
bodied
with
some
of
the
best
drinkability
ive
found
in
a
stout
winner
nuff
said
maybe
just
a
touch
too
much
hoppiness
for
my
taste
but
very
good
d
1012
a
bottle
sorry
i
cant
help
but
price
talk
and
slightly
hard
to
find
here
i
have
another
bottle
lying
around
that
i
will
probably
trade
or
pass
off
to
another
good
looking
beer
but
didnt
have
the
heavy
body
or
roasted
aftertaste
to
suite
me
drinkability
man
i
gotta
say
it
mikkeller
pisses
me
off
i
want
to
like
their
beers
i
really
do
most
of
them
end
up
being
a
let
down
this
is
one
of
their
better
brews
and
it
wasnt
terrible
by
any
means
but
the
price
is
going
to
keep
me
from
purchasing
their
products
very
often
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
the
faintest
hints
of
a
dark
brown
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
it
thick
creamy
and
the
color
of
slightly
old
espresso
the
initial
smell
is
very
mild
holding
only
the
faintest
hints
of
oats
cocoa
coffee
and
a
mild
sweetness
a
little
agitation
releases
a
deeper
freshbrewed
coffee
aroma
that
made
my
mouth
water
yes
im
being
serious
here
that
freshbrewed
coffee
smell
is
a
trigger
or
if
youd
like
it
smells
like
a
freshly
opened
bag
of
espresso
roasted
coffee
beans
my
mind
is
kind
of
fuzzy
the
first
sip
is
like
the
first
smell
mild
there
are
coffee
cocoa
and
cream
notes
in
there
but
they
dont
really
jump
out
its
a
statement
in
subtle
power
so
many
things
are
going
on
with
those
flavors
but
none
of
them
are
powerful
enough
to
stand
out
its
like
a
quiet
intro
in
a
great
song
it
is
complex
but
you
have
to
strain
to
here
it
a
few
more
sips
and
the
true
nature
of
this
as
a
breakfast
stout
becomes
apparent
the
roasted
malts
are
everywhere
and
the
slightly
burnt
nature
of
freshbrewed
coffee
rises
to
the
front
a
touch
of
cream
sweetens
the
whole
thing
in
the
long
run
but
still
leaves
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
end
some
very
heavy
lace
notches
mark
the
glass
as
i
drink
it
down
which
lets
me
know
some
hopping
has
gone
on
but
i
really
cant
taste
it
some
warming
brings
it
all
together
amplifying
the
coffee
flavors
and
enhancing
some
of
the
underlying
cocoa
notes
all
around
this
beer
would
be
more
than
spectacular
with
some
chocolate
cake
for
breakfast
in
all
honesty
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
could
picture
drinking
for
breakfast
its
subdued
and
powerful
at
the
same
time
the
perfect
compliment
to
chocolate
cake
or
chocolate
chip
cookies
or
if
youre
looking
at
breakfast
a
chocolate
chip
muffin
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
coffee
flavor
with
a
tiny
little
alcohol
bite
on
the
end
after
taking
a
few
drinks
i
get
the
butterscotch
flavor
like
i
did
with
the
smell
really
dig
the
creamy
chewy
mouthfeel
on
this
one
nice
drinkability
but
dont
know
that
i
would
say
more
drinkable
that
fbs
d
i
couldnt
drink
thins
all
nite
it
would
be
too
harsh
but
if
so
i
would
really
enjoy
what
i
could
take
this
was
much
better
fresher
i
am
definitely
getting
more
coffee
flavors
the
bottle
i
had
in
july
was
probably
much
older
than
the
other
one
since
my
local
store
just
got
these
in
the
last
month
i
cant
say
i
like
it
more
than
peche
mortel
or
founders
breakfast
stout
but
its
very
tasty
overall
a
surprisingly
tasty
brew
the
stout
character
is
somewhat
compromised
by
the
strong
herbal
hop
that
said
this
is
a
brew
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
a
nice
bitter
coffee
stout
great
drinking
for
hop
heads
who
want
to
go
black
could
be
a
fridge
staple
if
not
for
the
large
price
tag
taste
wasnt
as
great
as
the
smell
watery
in
mouth
shy
coffee
flavors
very
light
bodied
shy
roasted
flavors
of
some
shorts
small
fruits
malty
chocolate
finish
with
some
shy
cascade
hoppy
touch
everything
ends
up
with
a
shy
woody
and
smoky
flavors
t
dry
roasted
coffee
no
other
way
to
describe
it
its
good
great
bitter
ending
but
the
flavor
lacks
complexity
my
palate
is
only
pulling
coffee
some
smokiness
which
ties
in
with
some
dry
roasted
malts
good
stuff
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
chocolate
but
beggars
cant
be
choosers
da
good
enough
beer
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
though
it
wasnt
anything
spectacular
ive
heard
quite
a
bit
about
this
beer
but
i
think
its
just
a
little
bit
overhyped
regardless
of
this
i
liked
drinking
this
beer
even
if
it
wasnt
for
breakfast
and
would
recommend
giving
it
a
go
full
bodied
thick
and
creamy
little
carbonation
some
grittiness
leading
to
a
lasting
aftertaste
moderate
drinkability
and
wow
a
terrible
aftertaste
d
pretty
drinkable
has
a
bit
of
a
harsh
coffee
flavor
to
it
that
i
was
hoping
would
be
more
mellow
i
dont
taste
the
alcohol
or
feel
it
which
is
nice
get
this
beer
and
rent
revenge
of
the
nerds
if
nothing
more
for
the
panty
raid
that
leads
to
the
ta
moments
of
the
movie
i
drink
much
more
hoppy
beer
now
and
i
find
this
to
be
sweeter
than
i
apparently
originally
thought
most
of
what
i
wrote
is
still
applicable
i
think
but
i
get
a
lot
more
fruity
flavors

d
a
nice
slow
drinker
nearly
black
pour
with
a
quite
sizeable
brown
head
mostly
coffee
some
roast
malt
aromas
really
sticks
to
the
glass
but
somewhat
medium
bodied
lots
of
coffee
up
front
and
throughout
some
mocha
or
bakers
chocolate
ends
with
a
little
bitterness
and
lingers
into
creaminess
definetely
near
the
top
but
not
above
the
founders
breakfast
stouts
maybe
more
drinkable
however
with
the
slightly
lower
abv
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
body
is
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
for
a
breakfast
i
want
something
that
resembles
milk
dammnit
thats
how
i
trick
my
body
into
thinking
im
not
killing
myself
by
drinking
so
early
in
the
morning
overall
a
pretty
good
impy
coffee
stout
definitely
recommended
d
for
someone
like
me
this
beer
is
easily
quaffed
i
like
big
stouts
and
while
this
one
comes
in
at
a
modest
compared
to
rises
7
5
abv
it
still
has
plenty
to
offer
tastewise
in
comparison
with
the
big
boys
yet
the
alcohol
isnt
noticed
at
all
so
theres
nothing
to
slow
you
down
could
be
dangerous
if
it
was
a
tad
bit
cheaper
and
you
like
your
breakfasts
to
last
awhile
as
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
a
second
and
then
a
third
and
theyd
all
go
down
real
easy
a
very
nice
beer
but
like
most
its
difficult
to
live
up
to
the
billing
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
damn
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
ive
had
the
oatmeal
give
it
an
almost
perfect
mouthfeel

with
a
big

of

lots
of

chocolate
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
very
rich
mouthfeel
more
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
in
the
flavor
long
lasting
very
dry
chocolatecoffee
finish
there
is
also
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
towards
the
end
good
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
the
most
part
at
the
price
it
wont
be
in
my
regular
rotation
but
a
must
try
pours
a
dark
black
with
dark
brown
head
the
aroma
is
an
overpowering
scent
of
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
hints
of
chocolate
alcohol
and
roasted
maltiness
accompany
the
strong
roasted
coffe
flavor
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
balance
to
lessen
the
coffee
taste
slightly
d
very
good
stout
very
drinkable
maybe
a
little
heavy
to
some
but
great
drink
all
around
from
a
500
ml
bottle
this
poured
like
used
motor
oil
and
raised
a
rich
and
foam
light
brown
head
and
lacing
like
glue
nose
of
roasted
malts
almost
smoky
very
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
powerful
with
burnt
malts
showing
chocolate
coffee
and
vanilla
this
stuff
is
a
rich
as
it
gets
and
is
sort
of
in
a
class
by
itself
ranks
up
there
with
speedway
stout
though
it
tastes
very
different
enjoyed
very
much
d
very
impressive
coffee
flavor
but
overall
not
the
best
stout
needs
a
little
more
balance
for
the
coffee
flavor
and
a
fuller
body
to
be
on
same
level
as
breakfast
stout
bells
java
or
wake
n
bake
dark
brown
near
black
color
with
a
nice
espresso
head
the
nose
has
coffee
roasty
malts
bitter
hops
chocolate
and
molasses
the
taste
is
a
tasty
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
to
fruity
malts
and
piney
hops
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
a
great
coffee
beer
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
black
with
an
inch
and
a
half
brown
frothy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
it
smells
like
coffee
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
coffee
taste
is
pretty
strong
at
first
but
settles
down
after
a
while
theres
also
a
burntsmoky
taste
noticable
too
nice
bitter
finish
and
the
hops
come
out
more
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
a
bit
slick
and
has
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
at
a
time
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
this
again
wonderful
stout
im
a
coffee
lover
and
a
stout
lover
so
this
one
matches
both
almost
perfectly
tremendous
mouthfeel
similar
to
a
sam
smith
oatmeal
or
comparable
silky
smooth
stout
aroma
is
nice
but
not
as
strong
as
expected
flavor
is
roasted
coffee
and
roasted
barley
hard
to
ask
for
more
than
that
the
strangest
and
somewhat
most
welcome
part
of
this
beer
is
the
hoppiness
at
the
end
you
can
tell
that
they
used
cascade
which
is
about
as
far
from
a
stout
hop
as
you
can
get
tremendous
coffee
finish
on
this
one
as
well
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
taste
is
milky
coffee
and
cocoa
nibs
hitachino
for
the
third
of
the
price
had
a
fuller
body
a
creamier
mouthfeel
and
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
oh
well
mikkeller
is
a
great
brewery
and
i
never
regret
trying
their
beers
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
im
going
to
have
to
sit
down
and
see
how
the
overall
a
very
good
coffee
stout
a
bit
too
thin
for
me
but
still
very
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
snifter
pitch
black
with
a
mocha
head
about
a
finger
tall
excellent
retention
some
nice
fine
lacing
aromas
of
brownie
mix
coffee
beans
and
caramel
black
coffee
flavor
with
the
darkest
possible
chocolate
very
very
roasty
caramel
licorice
and
ash
accents
bitter
finish
robust
body
but
silky
smooth
not
overly
complex
but
very
wellcrafted
and
easy
to
drink
d
tasty
no
doubt
but
also
not
an
easy
drinker
pours
a
thick
dark
brownblack
color
with
the
consistency
of
spent
motor
oil
a
huge
billowy
creamed
coffee
head
develops
which
slowly
recedes
into
a
nice
cap
leaving
behind
lots
of
lacing
looks
great
nice
raosted
coffee
aroma
burnt
caramel
and
bitter
roasted
malts
flavor
is
black
coffeelicious
there
must
have
been
copious
amounts
of
coffee
used
in
this
brew
bitter
chocolate
espresso
beans
lightly
bittersweet
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
tries
to
push
through
this
thick
and
heady
brew
alcohol
is
easily
detected
in
the
nose
but
not
so
much
on
the
tongue
delicious
treat
and
would
be
great
with
breakfast
as
the
name
would
imply
yum
the
dealbreaker
for
this
one
is
the
price
yes
its
being
imported
so
i
cant
be
too
mad
but
when
youre
at
the
store
and
you
have
the
choice
between
a
4pk
of
fbs
or
a
bomber
of
this
its
going
to
be
the
fbs
99
times
out
of
100
d
the
thiness
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
it
is
just
an
average
brew
in
the
taste
department
the
smell
and
look
is
great
just
that
taste
and
feel
are
turn
offs
such
a
shame
yeah
i
see
why
this
beer
is
so
highly
regarded
i
liked
it
quite
a
lot
which
is
saying
something
since
this
normally
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
i
seek
out
taste
almost
like
the
first
sip
of
espresso
you
get
an
extreme
rush
of
roasted
malts
coffee
with
dark
chocolate
undertones
fruity
acidity
faint
smoke
and
herbal
hop
flavors
come
into
the
picture
midpalate
adding
some
depth
to
the
roast
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
everything
drops
out
of
the
picture
other
than
the
intense
bitter
flavors
from
the
dark
malts
and
hops
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
it
tastes
fine
and
it
feels
alright
it
could
certainly
stand
to
have
the
body
thicker
as
well
as
a
bit
more
available
in
the
flavor
profile
consider
me
slightly
disappointed
taste
same
as
the
smell
only
bigger
heavier
coffee
chocolate
smoke
lots
of
roasted
malt
tar
heavy
bitterness
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
very
bitter
and
thick
this
one
was
not
easy
for
me
to
drink
50
cl
bottle
is
way
too
much
if
you
dont
share
it
with
someone
which
i
didnt
i
really
didnt
like
that
coffee
taste
however
if
you
like
this
style
then
youll
probably
like
this
one
it
seems
to
me
to
be
well
done
but
personally
i
dont
like
it
im
beginning
to
believe
that
my
new
favorite
style
of
beer
are
oatmeal
stouts
it
somehow
smelled
like
a
fruity
coffee
something
i
would
never
try
but
yet
it
smelled
right
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
was
the
bitterness
i
expected
coffee
not
espresso
i
love
the
feel
of
this
beer
like
drinking
laced
coffee
i
did
not
get
any
real
fruitflavor
out
of
this
but
there
is
a
hint
of
oatmeal
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
am
glad
my
husband
and
i
split
the
bottle
i
do
think
i
could
get
tired
of
this
if
i
had
to
drink
the
whole
thing
myself
sip
savor
drink
with
fine
chocolates
alongside
d
definitely
worth
a
try
and
big
on
style
a
hair
of
the
dog
beer
for
the
morning
after
with
a
huge
coffee
showing
a
big
rich
treat
for
the
coffee
lover
in
everyone
flavor
very
hoppy
malty
and
not
very
coffeey
this
is
in
the
pacific
northwest
imperial
stout
style
in
which
a
strong
hoppy
bitterness
is
deemed
appropriate
although
the
hop
flavors
dont
seem
to
be
characteristically
american
surprising
lack
of
coffee
flavor
and
aroma
for
a
beer
that
has
an
image
of
coffee
beans
on
the
label
i
think
it
is
overpowered
by
the
hops
flavor
and
bitterness
ack
it
really
has
a
harsh
hops
bite
im
such
a
wimp
its
really
kind
of
ipaish
maybe
some
aging
would
let
the
hops
die
down
but
it
would
effect
the
coffee
flavor
too
drinkability
is
good
too
and
im
glad
that
mikkeller
didnt
go
the
way
of
most
amerian
breweries
making
doubleimperial
stouts
and
create
a
10
alcohol
bomb
this
beer
has
enough
strength
to
make
it
full
in
flavor
and
character
but
not
so
much
that
its
oneanddone
immediately
following
my
first
drink
of
peche
mortel
which
was
excellent
this
is
leaner
roastier
but
nicely
balanced
and
thorough
in
the
way
that
it
finishes
the
topping
is
chocolate
brown
and
aggressive
very
dry
tannins
but
clipped
with
an
aristocratic
symmetry
coffee
and
burned
caraway
suggest
coffee
on
a
bagel
replete
with
seeds
i
like
this
beer
very
much
but
it
is
austere
like
a
bad
recording
of
joy
divisions
disorder
still
great
d
cant
see
having
more
then
one
at
a
sitting
the
increasing
bitterness
and
the
dry
quilities
makes
me
not
see
it
as
a
beer
to
return
to
my
house
d
that
is
coffee
for
alcoholics
right
there
or
breakfast
for
beer
geeks
i
suppose
excellent
brew
my
first
mikeller
brew
came
with
plenty
of
hype
and
i
was
not
let
down
this
beer
could
seriously
replace
my
morning
coffee
d
this
is
a
one
and
out
beer
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
experience
but
doubt
i
will
put
it
into
my
regular
rotation
it
had
a
bit
to
much
bite
for
my
taste
budes
i
know
a
lot
of
people
think
that
once
youve
had
one
coffee
stout
youve
had
them
all
but
i
dissagree
this
is
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
ive
had
beautiful
appearance
and
different
things
hit
you
at
different
times
strong
dark
coffee
dark
fruit
dark
sugar
and
dark
chocolate
a
bit
like
samuel
smiths
imperial
stout
with
coffee
and
a
better
body
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
hefty
price
tag
hurt
a
bit
but
im
happy
to
support
these
guys
and
its
nice
to
see
great
craft
beer
coming
from
this
part
of
the
world
overall
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
and
i
enjoyed
but
i
cant
see
myself
going
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
drinkability
is
high
for
such
a
dark
beer
with
many
complex
flavours
outstanding
beer
as
for
drinkability
that
aftertaste
and
feel
keep
me
going
back
for
more
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
indeed
packed
with
oatmeal
and
coffee
it
does
make
a
nice
breakfast
when
the
occasion
is
right
pours
a
oil
dark
black
with
a
big
brown
head
aroma
is
moderately
sweet
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
is
coffee
oatmeal
and
dark
chocolate
medium
body
creamy
texture
finish
is
long
and
bitter
chocolate
dont
know
about
breakfast
but
a
few
of
these
could
constitute
a
dinner
compared
to
other
great
coffee
stouts
this
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
but
it
is
a
perfectly
decent
stout
a
case
of
high
expectations
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
this
for
breakfast
or
any
other
time
for
that
matter
its
perhaps
the
best
use
of
coffee
in
a
beer
that
ive
come
across
although
theres
no
telling
how
long
it
will
hold
that
distinction
as
ive
got
a
péché
mortel
waiting
in
my
fridge
id
make
this
a
regular
in
my
fridge
except
for
a
couple
things
its
very
expensive
and
its
not
available
in
virginia
i
got
it
in
north
carolina
still
for
those
who
have
access
to
it
its
worth
seeking
out
highly
recommended
mikkeller
is
indeed
a
great
brewery
and
i
love
their
mikkeller
black
this
one
is
nice
but
it
really
gets
a
bit
too
much
coffeé
youd
think
the
thin
mouthfeel
may
help
this
out
but
the
bitter
and
dry
coffee
finish
makes
this
a
slow
sipper
makes
the
tongue
feel
a
little
coarse
an
overall
interesting
offering
that
i
enjoyed
and
would
recommend
though
liking
coffee
is
a
huge
requirement
d
a
solid
brew
that
the
coffee
lovers
should
enjoy
i
dug
this
no
doubt
about
it
superglad
i
tried
it
but
the
mikkeller
stuff
is
damn
expensive
so
i
think
ill
probably
go
for
their
nwstyle
ipa
or
barleywine
again
before
retrying
this
one
there
are
better
coffee
stouts
but
beer
geek
breakfast
is
no
slouch
and
the
name
rules
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
big
dark
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
nose
is
a
great
blend
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
is
choocolateoatsroasted
maltsesperesso
mouthfeel
is
nice
creamy
and
roasted
well
balanced
drinkability
is
exceptional
abv
is
just
right
which
keeps
it
drinkable
on
any
day
this
a
decent
stout
i
wanted
to
like
it
more
but
too
many
citrusy
flavors
and
mint
come
through
and
it
takes
away
from
the
robustness
of
the
malt
and
the
coffee
its
a
good
one
to
try
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
via
trade
this
is
a
well
carbonated
stout
which
being
a
coffee
stout
i
can
appreciate
the
body
is
medium
full
perhaps
a
tad
thin
but
that
will
happen
with
coffee
stouts
the
emphasis
is
obviously
on
the
coffee
and
it
performs
well
but
the
roasted
malt
is
also
nice
and
some
dark
chocolates
again
peak
in
and
out
overall
not
as
good
as
id
imagined
but
still
quite
a
good
beer
ovr
ive
had
a
lot
of
really
good
coffee
stouts
recently
and
this
one
was
good
but
not
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
this
is
a
very
good
coffee
stout
but
the
vicious
onslaught
of
deep
roasted
coffee
and
espresso
really
takes
a
toll
on
my
tastebuds
id
have
this
again
but
id
have
to
share
a
bottle
with
someone
not
in
the
same
league
as
southern
tier
jahva
and
founders
breakfast
stout
but
definitely
recommended
for
fans
of
coffee
stouts
overall
this
ranks
in
the
top
3
coffee
stouts
ive
tried
i
love
that
it
packs
such
robust
flavor
without
bringing
too
much
heat
but
really
i
wouldnt
consume
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
anyway
theres
a
crapload
of
coffee
in
this
pours
a
beautifully
stunning
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
foamy
inch
caramel
colored
head
thick
milk
shake
like
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
and
hardly
lets
go
smells
of
rich
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
malts
dominate
first
taste
is
surprisingly
more
chocolaty
than
the
aroma
indicated
the
coffee
flavor
is
lovingly
mean
and
bitter
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
fairly
light
bodied
very
tasty
beer
and
coffee
lovers
rejoice
i
like
the
subduedness
there
is
a
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
very
smooth
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
ive
enjoyed
it
every
time
definitely
a
sipper
and
a
good
one
at
that
it
comes
across
more
chocolaty
than
coffeelike
to
me
which
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
given
the
coffee
beans
on
the
label
i
love
the
texture
from
the
oats
and
the
way
everything
melds
together
this
was
drank
after
dinner
i
expect
id
enjoy
it
much
more
first
thing
in
the
morning
next
time
d
a
good
brew
for
breakfast
or
anytime
another
solid
offering
from
mikkeller
but
not
quite
in
the
same
class
as
the
better
american
coffee
stouts
such
as
those
from
founders
d
interesting
and
complex
but
this
beer
is
just
too
dry
and
i
feel
if
it
were
toned
down
just
a
bit
more
maybe
with
age
it
would
be
out
of
this
world
because
this
is
like
no
beer
ive
ever
tried
a
slow
sipper
if
there
ever
was
one
but
not
because
of
alcohol
heat
of
full
bodiedness
this
beer
is
as
dry
as
the
sahara
poured
a
glass
of
this
from
one
of
the
three
bottle
i
picked
up
at
greens
a
few
weeks
ago
pours
a
deep
brownblack
color
very
good
looking
head
on
top
of
it
head
is
very
sweet
smelling
taste
is
a
little
less
balanced
than
i
thought
it
would
be
alot
of
coffee
and
pretty
damn
bitter
to
boot
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
a
good
coffee
brew
but
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
d
i
heart
this
one
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
once
the
abv
is
surprisingly
low
for
a
big
tasting
beer
a
good
beer
but
most
definitely
not
worth
the
price
pick
up
some
founders
breakfast
stout
or
bells
java
stout
pours
brownishblack
incredible
huge
rocky
and
dense
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
the
duration
lots
of
lacing
some
malted
milk
chocolate
aroma
and
espresso
in
the
nose
taste
is
disappointing
sour
coffee
taste
almost
like
drinking
a
dayold
cup
of
coffee
bitter
chocolate
its
a
touch
sour
really
active
carbonation
for
the
style
comes
off
more
like
a
porter
to
me
im
generally
a
big
fan
of
stoutsporters
that
leave
coffee
aftertaste
but
this
one
is
just
too
much
for
the
money
this
was
a
big
letdown
still
interested
in
trying
more
from
mikkeller
but
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
get
it
fine
carbonation
helps
prevent
it
all
from
being
too
much
coffee
goodness
keeping
things
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
creamy
feel
outstanding
drinkability
for
the
beerandcoffee
geek
with
moderately
deep
pockets
dont
know
if
id
put
this
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorite
coffee
stouts
but
its
an
excellent
entry
in
the
category
satisfying
think
ill
have
another
even
at
10
a
bottle
ps
i
would
suggest
bells
java
stout
central
waters
coffee
stout
andor
great
divides
oak
aged
yeti
with
espresso
wholeheartedly
over
this
brew
and
yes
that
dieu
du
ciel
peche
mortel
too
oh
what
the
heck
lets
go
ahead
and
throw
in
alesmith
speedway
and
deschutes
abyss
as
well
even
though
they
dont
have
strong
coffee
flavors
you
know
what
why
not
throw
something
else
in
from
my
imperial
stout
loving
friends
i
liked
it
but
they
loved
it
and
its
called
bells
expedition
stout
in
the
end
i
started
realizing
some
of
the
bitterness
is
coming
from
the
coffee
pours
a
black
with
only
very
dark
brown
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
just
right
pours
a
pretty
good
two
finger
light
egg
white
froth
with
a
tan
twinge
the
aroma
is
crawling
with
dry
notes
of
oatmeal
before
you
heat
it
up
with
fresh
from
the
eak
broken
can
coffee
morning
blend
the
taste
starts
bone
dry
with
just
plain
dark
roasted
malts
the
middle
develops
into
amore
coffe
ground
flavor
and
texture
with
some
light
milky
oatmeal
notes
in
the
finish
mixed
with
dry
pine
hops
the
texture
is
a
little
sandy
with
lots
of
bitter
charred
malts
and
some
earthy
hops
but
a
vey
dry
palate
overall
interesting
combination
of
two
beer
styles
drinks
alright
just
too
close
to
cold
coffee
for
me
to
stick
with
this
past
a
bottle
better
than
most
coffee
beers
ive
had
but
needs
more
richness
md
full
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
edge
to
it
a
little
strong
on
the
taste
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
a
very
sippable
brew
d
this
is
great
for
a
morning
brew
i
have
passed
this
beer
up
a
few
times
in
the
pasti
finally
broke
down
and
bought
it
yesterday
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
an
opaque
black
i
mean
no
light
showing
thru
this
bad
boya
large
fluffy
dark
colored
head
atop
smells
just
like
a
espresso
roast
coffee
just
heavy
roasted
malt
there
is
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
as
well
but
its
somewhat
hidden
under
the
intense
roast
a
sharp
almost
fizzy
mouthfeel
was
unexpected
and
not
wanted
and
it
hindered
the
richness
of
the
beerflavors
are
intense
coffee
with
notes
of
black
pepper
and
earth
as
wellits
very
dry
not
much
sweetness
just
a
touch
of
unsweetened
chocolate
this
seemed
a
bit
raw
and
i
didnt
like
the
mouthfeel
muchmaybe
a
little
overrated
md
slick
creamy
decent
mouthfeel
not
very
drinkable
for
me
a
drain
pour
if
not
for
the
amount
spent
on
the
bottle
i
dont
know
if
its
truly
the
beer
or
if
i
am
just
having
bad
luck
with
mikkeller
seems
that
nearly
everything
i
pick
up
from
them
is
a
big
dud
as
for
drinkability
i
am
not
a
person
famous
for
my
ability
to
down
strong
stouts
in
a
few
minutes
however
i
am
really
making
good
progress
with
this
one
thank
you
denmark
bomber
aged
about
a
year
super
pitch
black
pour
and
nearly
opaque
smaller
light
tan
foam
aroma
is
quite
suave
with
an
intricate
blend
of
coffee
and
malt
goodness
some
hints
of
mocha
vanilla
espresso
etc
flavor
is
terrificly
balanced
and
fairly
complex
with
a
really
impressive
and
vibrant
blend
of
coffee
elements
bottle
conditioned
or
left
heavily
unfiltered
the
texture
and
body
is
quite
nice
hints
of
chocolate
and
roast
with
coffee
elements
of
vanilla
and
mocha
some
espresso
it
all
blends
really
well
together
the
bombers
brewed
at
gourmet
brewery
are
very
tasty
although
ive
heard
from
a
friend
that
the
new
500
ml
bottle
brewed
at
nogne
o
are
not
nearly
as
good
well
this
was
a
coffee
stout
that
knows
when
to
reign
back
the
java
and
let
the
stout
part
shine
big
and
black
with
a
tight
tan
head
this
beer
immediately
smelled
of
fresh
expresso
but
further
sniffs
brought
out
dark
malts
chocolate
and
an
earthy
backnote
the
beer
is
very
coffee
on
the
first
few
sips
but
soon
the
beer
part
comes
in
play
and
puts
the
coffee
in
its
place
very
well
made
and
very
complex
this
is
a
beer
to
rival
peche
de
mortel
in
the
style
i
should
know
as
i
had
a
peche
right
after
tasting
this
beer
its
very
slick
and
chewy
with
a
good
amount
of
residue
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
cant
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
but
thats
all
you
need
this
beer
exceeds
the
massive
amount
of
hype
and
just
about
lands
into
my
top
5
stouts

class
beer
geek
breakfast
stout
is
definitely
a
great
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
excessive
though
so
i
dont
know
how
long
it
will
be
until
i
come
back
to
it
hopefully
i
time
it
more
correctly
with
cold
weather
next
time
pleasure
to
drinka
little
lighter
than
expected
solid
wellbalanced
and
wellconstructed
bold
characterful
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
d
this
beer
really
fell
flat
for
me
literally
assuming
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
i
really
wouldnt
care
if
i
never
drank
this
again
its
a
fine
beer
just
not
anything
id
rank
so
high
up
on
the
doubleimperial
stout
list
pours

dark

smoothly
into

coffee
really
dominates
here

is
notes
of

and
very
slight
hints
of
coffee
full
and
rich
palate
with
a
medium
lasting
smooth
finish
expected
more
taste
of
coffee
but
still
a
great
brew
d
the
heavy
coffee
bitterness
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
slightly
though
i
still
got
through
the
bottle
faster
than
i
probably
should
have
overall
not
my
favorite
coffee
stout
but
a
very
good
brew
d
the
burnt
finish
would
make
it
tough
to
have
more
than
one
but
thats
okay
with
the
price
in
pa
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
much
sought
after
brew
at
liquor
world
in
porter
square
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
rich
looking
tan
heading
that
soon
fades
in
to
a
nice
ring
lace
crown
nose
is
closed
off
for
the
most
part
mainly
some
ghost
scents
of
coffee
smoke
and
char
taste
is
reflective
of
what
the
cover
of
the
bottle
shows
bitter
beans
of
coffee
starts
off
tasting
sort
of
cola
like
but
then
settles
in
with
lots
of
roasted
coffee
bean
earth
and
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
carbonated
which
i
suppose
lends
itself
to
the
coffee
aspect
of
the
brew
but
doesnt
strike
me
as
being
characteristic
of
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
although
one
bottle
is
way
more
than
i
need
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
price
tag
was
too
much
for
what
they
brewed
overall
this
beer
really
disappointed
me
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
by
any
means
but
it
wasnt
a
rock
star
like
proclaimed
it
was
just
too
unbalanced
even
for
a
coffee
stout
i
love
coffee
and
i
love
beer
ive
had
other
coffee
stouts
and
porters
that
were
excellent
unfortunately
this
was
not
one
of
them
it
may
be
good
for
breakfast
just
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
like
drinking
a
coffee
id
rather
have
the
warm
cup
of
joe
before
i
go
to
work
plus
the
cost
of
the
coffee
is
only
a
fraction
of
what
i
paid
for
this
no
complaints
on
the
mouthfeel
with
an
excellent
marriage
of
creamy
and
crisp
bitterness
is
aggressive
with
a
different
slant
than
that
imparted
by
hops
so
drinkability
isnt
through
the
roof
still
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
mikkeller
drinkability
very
drinkable
just
like
a
good
cup
of
coffee
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
the
perfect
way
to
start
my
day
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
thick
full
mouthfeel
with
a
lightly
bitter
finish
drinkability
finishs
a
bit
dirty
and
is
a
bit
heavy
and
is
like
black
coffee
in
that
respect
i
actually
paired
this
up
with
a
plate
of
french
toast
and
crispy
hash
browns
with
mushrooms
vidalia
onions
and
cheddar
cheese
this
was
delicious
and
from
the
label
i
must
say
this
fulfills
its
intended
purpose
admirably
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thick
and
not
very
carbonated
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
but
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
some
others
i
could
drink
this
stuff
for
breakfastlunch
and
dinner
if
it
were
more
redily
available
drinkability
on
this
one
is
good
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
handle
a
few
of
these
bombers
considering
how
intense
this
beer
is
that
said
it
is
delicious
and
i
encourage
everyone
to
try
this
beer
if
given
the
opportunity
also
dont
expect
to
be
tasting
other
beers
after
this
one
your
tastebuds
will
need
a
rest
it
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
but
the
excessive
coffee
did
nothing
to
improve
its
drinkability
perhaps
it
is
just
me
but
i
cannot
finish
this
one
picked
up
a
bottle
today
as
i
saw
it
was
new
to
the
area
poured
a
big
dark
tan
head
it
looked
more
like
a
coke
than
a
beer
with
all
the
head
on
it
the
nose
was
very
coffeeespresso
laden
first
taste
is
quite
creamy
and
smooth
it
gives
way
to
some
bitterness
and
coffee
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hop
kick
at
the
end
pretty
good
beer
overall
probably
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
but
still
a
good
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
out
of
12oz
bottle
literally
one
of
the
prettiest
brews
after
the
pour
i
have
ever
seen
a
5
finger
head
shot
up
the
glass
as
bubbles
cascaded
down
the
sides
like
a
waterfall
left
a
massive
three
finger
head
after
it
settled
thick
and
clumpy
kinda
like
a
coke
float
on
top
of
a
brownish
black
beer
smells
has
kind
of
a
spicy
hop
behind
the
malt
burnt
espresso
floats
around
as
well
smooth
espresso
right
up
front
on
the
taste
very
faint
sweet
smoothness
before
getting
smack
around
by
the
coffee
taste
the
rest
of
the
way
not
as
layered
as
i
had
hoped
just
a
smooth
burnt
coffee
taste
with
a
sweetness
around
the
sides
hops
sneak
through
the
back
door
in
the
end
an
enjoyable
brew
certainly
pleasing
to
the
eye
i
had
hoped
for
a
bit
more
after
what
i
had
heard
d
overall
this
is
a
good
coffee
beer
it
is
not
the
top
coffee
beer
that
i
ever
had
but
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
packs
a
punch
i
would
pick
it
up
again
and
have
to
say
that
it
would
probably
go
very
well
with
chocolate
cake
also
think
that
the
bitter
and
roasted
flavors
would
makes
this
a
good
candidate
from
a
beer
float
i
just
wish
it
packed
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
had
a
bit
thicker
mouthfeel
as
well
d
not
the
greatest
stout
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
a
tasty
one
that
deserves
its
praise
worth
seeking
out
overall
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
these
if
you
can
get
them
bm
me
and
lets
trade
a
very
nice
beer
full
of
intense
high
quality
flavors
very
highly
recommended
this
one
poured
pitch
black
with
just
about
the
darkest
brown
head
that
ive
seen
it
formed
a
thick
creamy
cap
off
the
pour
and
settled
to
a
solid
ring
and
skim
of
fine
bubbles
leaving
behind
streaky
and
spotty
lacing
lots
of
coffee
and
roast
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
malty
caramel
base
notes
of
licorice
and
chocolate
also
appeared
as
it
warmed
moderate
bitterness
was
mostly
overshadowed
by
the
rich
malt
sweetness
and
roasted
coffee
flavours
again
chocolate
and
licorice
were
mild
but
added
depth
and
complexity
hops
contributed
a
light
grassiness
to
the
finish
caramel
was
present
throughout
great
texture
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
well
integrated
carbonation
truly
a
fine
stout
well
balanced
considering
the
strong
character
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
opaque
and
black
in
color
with
a
thick
head
that
fell
away
there
were
scents
of
roased
coffee
beans
dark
chocolate
and
heavy
cream
in
the
mouth
it
was
mediumbodied
and
showed
off
the
coffee
and
chocolate
the
hops
picked
up
toward
the
finish
which
just
added
to
the
bitter
black
coffee
feeling
a
very
nice
brew
but
i
have
the
feeling
that
some
barrel
aging
would
help
fill
out
the
midpalate
i
could
probably
only
have
one
or
two
of
these
because
of
the
thickness
and
alcohol
taste
but
its
so
balanced
and
complex
i
wouldnt
mind
being
extra
full
from
this
beer
d
wonderfully
drinkable
for
an
extreme
beer
enjoyed
the
heck
out
of
this
cheers
to
akorsak
for
the
extra
i
think
this
beer
is
slightly
hyped
and
overrated
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
trying
it
even
tho
there
are
better
imperial
stouts
out
there
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
and
i
feel
obliged
to
recommend
it
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
seems
to
be
overhyped
to
me
it
was
very
expensive

there
are
many
good
examples
of
stoutscoffee
oatmeal
imperial
breakfast
etc
that
i
enjoy
more
that
are
far
less
money
it
pours
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
it
displays
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
coffe
flavor
much
the
same
although
a
little
more
to
the
dry
roasty
side
of
things
than
creamy
as
many
oatmeal
stouts
seem
to
be
i
had
a
hoppin
frog
b
o
r
i
s
the
crusher
today
as
well
and
it
blew
this
beer
away
in
my
opinion
it
was
only
6
99
as
well
nearly
half
the
cost
for
a
bigger
more
flavorful
beer
drinkability
this
really
is
a
great
beer
the
balance
and
appropriate
attributes
dont
go
over
the
top
but
are
patient
and
subdued
the
anise
and
licorice
flavors
are
what
do
it
for
me
the
most
a
true
treat
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
itself
pours
very
dark
oily
black
with
a
nice
lasting
dark
brown
head
gorgeous
smell
is
rich
dark
chocolatey
malt
taste
is
rich
dark
smooth
chocolate
with
a
nice
coffee
grind
bite
to
it
but
well
balanced
and
not
over
the
top
coffee
slightly
rich
and
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
it
goes
down
so
easily
nicely
light
bittered
finish
to
give
it
a
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
flavor
and
a
good
hit
of
obvious
but
restrained
coffee
flavor
as
well
damn
good
beer
taste
mouthfeel
upfront
dark
roasted
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
molasses
dry
yet
so
damn
smooth
and
rich
for
7

abv
a
perfect
example
of
how
much
oatmeal
can
contribute
to
the
texture
of
a
brew
the
finish
is
coating
but
pleasantly
mild
leaving
some
lasting
notes
of
coffee
and
toast
dry
throughandthrough
the
lack
of
sweetness
makes
this
one
highly
drinkable
beer
despite
its
chewy
texture
it
had
a
sharp
bite
to
it
from
the
coffee
overall
a
solid
brew
to
say
the
least
as
far
as
being
worth
the
eu
to
us
dollars
rate
that
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
pretty
good
drinkability
if
youre
a
coffee
fan
its
great
drinkability
thanks
a
million
to
johnnnniee
for
the
growling
at
the
moon
kicker
d
i
could
see
people
actually
having
this
for
breakfast
really
great
beer
that
is
super
complex
while
not
beating
you
down
with
abv
the
scandinavians
are
making
some
marvelous
stuff
as
of
late
tasters
note
special
thanks
to
beerhandy
for
sharing
this
bottle
pours
quite
thick
with
a
nearblack
body
and
virtually
no
highlights
the
head
forms
only
a
collar
on
the
beer
the
nose
is
a
fairly
straightforward
mix
of
standard
americanimpy
stout
with
some
extra
coffee
notes
thrown
in
but
there
is
a
particularly
nice
warm
doughy
note
hovering
in
the
background
the
palate
is
where
this
beer
separates
itself
from
the
pack
things
start
off
sweet
like
rich
coffee
with
sugar
and
a
touch
of
cream
with
plenty
of
roasted
barley
to
rough
things
up
significant
hop
bitterness
comes
through
next
along
with
some
acidity
that
sets
the
sides
of
the
tongue
alight
at
the
finish
the
roast
comes
through
again
dry
and
evocative
but
never
acridly
bitter
everything
on
the
palate
is
seamlessly
integrated
its
a
big
beer
thats
never
unbalanced
in
any
way
mouthfeel
is
excellent
a
lot
of
beers
would
go
for
more
body
here
but
i
feel
that
the
mediumheavy
body
is
enough
to
convey
the
necessary
flavors
while
also
being
spare
enough
to
enhance
drinkability
overall
this
is
fantastic
stuff
that
all
stout
fans
should
sample
at
some
point
very
well
done
a
very
american
craft
beer
from
denmark
the
price
may
discourage
regular
return
visits
but
well
worth
the
initial

cranking
out
a
zesty

spicey
richness
this
fueled
by
wonderful
full
coffee
tones
that
are
carried
nicely
by
the
oats
burnt
malts
are
all
over
the
palate
and
add
nicely
the
feel
incredibly
smooth
and
amazingly
complex
this
beer
shows
great
balance
the
richness
of
this
beer
lomes
long
on
the
mouthfeel
with
appropriate
coffee
feel
this
beer
belongs
in
the
upper
echelon
of
coffee
based
stouts
very
lovely
drinkable
brew
bottle
pours
with
a
pitch

black

oatmeal

liquorice
oily

full

the
finish
is
bitter
and
again
with
roasted

a
complex
and
very
drinkable
brew
recommended
as
i
watch
my
3
and
5
year
old
highstepping
it
through
the
snow
with
their
mother
out
my
front
window
this
brew
makes
the
moment
perfect
its
the
only
bottle
that
i
have
but
i
cant
think
of
a
more
perfect
way
to
experience
it
in
sampling
other
breakfat
stouts
i
must
come
back
to
this
one
and
comment
further
on
what
a
truly
perfect
breakfast
stout
this
is
it
has
become
my
standard
to
judge
every
breakfast
stout
i
try
although
i
love
the
style
this
particular
expression
is
not
to
my
taste
i
need
just
a
touch
of
sugar
from
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
not
too
much
but
more
than
im
getting
here
certainly
a
very
good
beer
but
probably
ultimately
not
for
me
as
far
as
drinkability
the
acridness
of
the
finish
and
the
overall
burnt
balance
to
the
flavor
cause
the
experience
to
be
one
i
would
not
want
to
repeat
often
that
said
the
nose
is
so
pleasing
as
to
merit
hours
of
sniffing
pleasure
this
is
certainly
a
musttry
for
any
complex
stout
fan
d
i
could
drink
this
but
i
am
very
let
down
that
it
isnt
quite
a
coffee
and
creamy
as
other
breakfast
stouts
not
bad
but
definitely
didnt
live
up
to
what
i
hoped
for
id
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
mikkellers
doing
something
right
for
sure
when
theyre
taking
on
the
americanstyle
extreme
crafts
theyre
doing
them
as
well
as
anyone
here
is
im
going
to
have
to
grab
their
draft
bear
and
ipa
offerings
on
my
next
liquormax
visit
the
taste
is
very
nice
notes
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
along
with
nice
dark
chocolate
and
man
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
to
it
the
finish
is
a
dark
chocolate
bitterness
that
lingers
on
well
after
the
swallow
and
the
alcohol
s
very
well
hidden
as
i
take
more
sips
i
begin
to
notice
that
the
roasted
malt
takes
on
more
of
a
burnt
malt
flavour
and
that
works
out
just
fine
for
me
err
the
strange
thing
is
each
sip
i
take
seems
to
be
slightly
different
from
the
previous
sip
its
almost
like
the
flavours
are
on
rotation
that
said
this
is
one
tasty
and
drinkable
son
of
a
gun
and
im
very
pleased
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
a
good
beer
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
coffeeish
for
my
taste
the
only
stout
that
can
get
away
with
that
imho
is
speedway
poured
into
a
chalice
a
deep
dark
thick
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzycreamy
dark
tan
head
which
left
a
nice
blob
of
oil
slick
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
and
some
sticky
lacing
around
the
edge
the
nose
is
bigmalty
nice
touch
of
coffeetoffeechocolatecaramel
and
some
roastiness
the
taste
is
very
malty
slightly
sweet
good
tones
of
the
dark
stuff
medium
body
a
well
rounded
brew
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
mikkeller
but
not
my
last
i
have
a

thanks
eric
wow
this
is
one
coffee
stout
that
puts
it
all
right
out
there
just
a
ton
of
big
coffee
accents
but
i
just
wish
that
there
was
a
tad
more
sweetness
to
counteract
all
that
burnt
roasted
bitterness
issues
aside
with
the
taste
i
still
found
this
very
good
in
the
drinkibility
department
and
recommend
it
for
beer
geeks
and
coffee
geeks
alike
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
huge
stiff
dark
tan
head
that
fades
to
sheets
of
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
first
a
creamy
oat
and
chocolate
it
gets
stronger
and
takes
on
a
more
heavily
roasted
malt
and
coffee
characters
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
yet
full
bodied
with
a
significant
tangy
espresso
bitterness
that
coats
and
lingers
full
flavored
the
deep
coffee
and
roasted
oat
tastes
are
blended
nicely
a
good
drinker

goes
to

for
the
opportunity
huge
one
inch
almost
brown
head
darkest
ive
ever
seen
big
aroma
toasted
dark
chocolate
strong
bitter
coffee
unfortunately
the
aroma
and
appearance
did
not
live
up
to
the
taste
of
this
beer
to
be
honest
i
was
a
little
disappointed
couldnt
taste
much
oatmeal
until
it
realy
warmed
up
was
quite
dry
it
was
ok
but
i
obviously
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
most
other
reviewers
i
have
another
bottle
which
i
rerate
in
a
couple
of
weeks
pours
a
nice
deep
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
good
lacing
smells
very
potent
in
coffee
along
with
espresso
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
big
coffee
taste
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
a
burnt
bitter
finish
medium
to
full
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
strong
finish
a
great
breakfast
stout
with
lots
of
coffee
flavors
just
like
advertised
good
both
chilled
and
at
room
temperature
sure
beats
going
to
starbucks
overall
excellent
breakfast
stout
just
as
advertised
pours
black
with
large
tan
head
aroma
has
a
lot
going
on
sweetness
chocolate
coffee
are
all
present
and
nicely
balanced
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
bitter
and
sweet
with
lots
of
raosted
flavors
this
is
really
good
stuff
with
a
great
aftertaste
a
big
robust
stout
that
drinks
a
lot
bigger
than
its
alcohol
presence
interesting
and
well
rounded
for
a
lighter
double
stout
d
this
is
one
i
want
to
have
more
often
almost
seasonable
but
still
very
interesting
and
lesson
in
balance
this
brew
teeters
on
that
fine
line
between
a
stout
and
a
double
stout
it
definitely
won
me
over
with
finesse
and
grace
rather
than
smacking
me
in
the
face
like
many
other
examples
in
this
category
do
i
paired
it
with
my
breakfast
of
chocolate
chip
pancakes
sausages
and
eggs
and
i
would
highly
recommend
others
to
do
likewise
d
solid
stout
no
doubt
approachable
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
you
still
cohesive
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
good
in
my
book
beer
poured
black
as
night
with
a
fine
brown
head
nose
is
wonderful
it
is
of
creamy
cherry
chocolate
coffee
and
kaluha
taste
is
an
awesome
combination
of
coffee
chocolate
maltsand
hops
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
creamy
smooth
and
somewhat
chewy
overall
drinkabilty
is
near
perfect
as
well
this
is
one
awesome
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
despite
its
hefty
price
tag
pours
impenetrable

with
a
thin
tan

very
malty

coffee
toned
nose
first
taste
is
very
coffee
and
dark

this
is
excellent
the
coffee
flavors
really
abound
and
i
can
see
the
breakfast
appeal
in
this
one
a
great

bean
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
wee
bit
thin
but
fine
with
me
it
is
however
missing
that
oatmeal

drinkability
is
very
high
great
brew
my

mikeller

i
will
defenitely
have
more
soon

snifter

black
with
a
dark
mocha
head
that
disappeared
quickly
strong
coffee
aroma
pours
off
of
this
one
there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
background
very
tasty
aroma
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
this
one
is
up
there
with
jahva
for
me
nice
roasty
flavor
filled
with
coffee
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
amazing
flavor
is
complemented
perfectly
with
a
nice
full
creamy
body
all
in
all
a
great
beer
with
a
pretty
reasonable
abv
for
the
style
d
a
beautifully
made
stout
the
complexity
is
great
even
though
its
not
a
15
bomb
but
i
like
that
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
just
a
very
balanced
stout
id
like
the
hop
ante
upped
a
bit
but
this
is
very
solid
however
its
expensive
a
tasty
brew
i
dont
think
it
belongs
with
its
current
rating
but
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
pours
pitch
black
with
a
very
dark
tan
head
nose
is
definitely
chocolate
nice
and
dark
cocoa
tones
to
it
flavor
is
pretty
good
though
i
have
to
say
i
dont
think
it
really
holds
up
to
the
look
and
whiff
of
things
definite
thick
malty
goodness
going
on
here
roasted
tones
are
there
in
a
mild
sense
feel
is
thick
on
the
liquid
and
has
a
lower
carbonation
id
say
it
is
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
greatest
of
the
style
but
definitely
well
made
with
enough
interesting
aspects
to
keep
your
interest
mouthfeel
was
exceptional
nice
and
creamy
and
an
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
for
the
style
this
is
my
first
5
0
for
drinkability
i
always
go
back
and
forth
with
that
score
usually
the
ones
i
would
like
to
give
it
to
are
big
tasty
beers
with
a
high
abv
this
beer
is
big
on
flavor
but
has
a
moderate
abv
i
think
i
could
probably
polish
off
two
bombers
of
this
on
my
own
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
the
price
it
seems
14
is
the
going
rate
in
my
book
its
worth
it
every
now
and
then
roasty
with
coffee
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
farily
simple
thick
and
creamy
with
low
carbonation
no
traces
of

very
easy
to
drink

thanks
the
overall
flavor
is
pretty
amazing
to
me
its
a
breakfast
stout
clone
which
isnt
bad
we
could
use
more
beers
that
taste
this
good
its
still
a
bit
of
a
slow
drinker
but
one
to
be
enjoyed
this
was
a
great
trade
thanks
again

mouthfeel

easy
this
one
seems
to
be
worth
the
hype
incredible
beer
rather
than
fill
my
fountain
with
it
i
drank
it
perhaps
the
best
decision
i
made
all
november
call
it
breakfast
but
few
morning
meals
deliver
such
ribsticking
highgrade
earthy
elements
with
complexity
challenging
and
blending
blessing
the
palate
abv
be
damned
this
one
you
drink
when
you
want
it
guiltfree
no
matter
the
time
this
is
one
style
trend
worth
following
with
this
beer
a
wonderful
representation
of
the
art
md
an
easy
drinker
for
a
large
double
stout
may
be
too
acrid
for
some
the
big
flavor
is
easy
down
and
highly
enjoyable
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
d
tasty
and
was
good
at
the
time
but
the
alcohol
drops
the
drinkability
a
bunch
would
like
to
see
this
aged
for
a
year
or
2
picked
this
up
at
beertopia
in
omaha
ne
in
august
and
its
been
calling
to
me
since
then
cool
bottle
lots
of
mystique
built
up
around
this
beer
so
well
see
how
it
holds
up
pours
black
with
a
khaki
head
that
looks
like
foamy
chocolate
milk
head
is
prety
short
and
fades
to
nothing
rather
quickly
odor
much
more
chocolate
that
coffeelike
some
tinlike
smells
as
well
and
some
dark
malt
taste
is
a
huge
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
almost
like
a
megaexpresso
version
of
an
iced
coffee
with
added
cocoa
powder
milk
and
alcohol
bitterness
from
the
coffee
is
intense
and
lingering
to
the
point
where
im
wondering
how
caffinated
this
is
am
i
drinking
beer
red
bull
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
overwhelming
coffee
lends
a
slight
metallic
hint
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
coats
the
mouth
making
it
almost
cottony
appropriately
full
bodied
so
yeah
its
pretty
good
those
danes
make
a
big
and
tasty
beer
pours
very
black
and
slightly
viscous
and
with
a
decent
initial
head
that
fades
rather
too
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
the
nose
has
notes
of
roasted
grain
smooth
coffee
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
very
balanced
and
smooth
mmore
so
than
some
other
breakfast
stouts
but
it
also
lacks
power
silky
notes
from
the
oatmeal
rounded
slightly
sweet
cocoa
notes
a
tad
of
cream
and
very
nice
gentle
coffee
flavors
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
well
integrated
but
could
be
a
tad
creamier
and
could
have
a
longer
finish
maybe
the
easiest
drinking
of
the
breakfast
stouts
but
in
some
ways
the
least
interesting
quite
good
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
i
prefer
a
little
more
power
but
not
burnt
coffee
which
some
get
wrong
this
one
didnt
mouthfeel
has
a
big
creamy
body
goes
down
smooth
and
is
damn
tasty
finishing
the
bomber
is
no
problem
here
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
anytime
of
the
day
overall
a
wonderful
coffee
stout
from
mikkeller
im
glad
to
see
their
brews
around
chicagoland
now
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
this
beer
poured
a
thick
oily
black
the
head
was
thick
and
mocha
colored

good
retention
the
smell
is
coffee
and
chocolate
mainly
there
are
some
hop
notes
as
well
as
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
is
big
of
coffee
and
quite
malty

simply
delicious
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
slightly
chewy

excellent
for
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
big
flavors
big
aroma
and
even
big
head
that
being
said
it
was
still
a
delight
to
drink
definitely
one
ill
be
revisiting
the
most
impressive
thing
to
me
about
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
its
just
so
soft
and
supple
and
round
sure
theres
an
edge
of
roastiness
but
thats
expected
all
of
the
other
pitfalls
of
a
beer
this
big
and
dark
have
been
avoided
fans
of
stout
should
seek
this
out
d
i
could
drink
these
everyday
if
i
could
get
them
around
here
this
is
an
outstandingly
tasty
and
drinkable
stout
fantastic
at
roughly
double
the
price
of
stone
imperial
russian
stout
i
cant
justify
drinking
beer
geek
breakfast
very
often
even
if
i
could
easily
acquire
it
its
amazingily
delicious
beer
though
and
deserves
every
one
of
the
accolades
thrown
its
way
with
nogne
in
norway
and
mikkeller
in
denmark
the
scandanavians
are
putting
the
world
on
notice
that
theyre
more
than
ready
to
compete
in
the
big
leagues
when
it
comes
to
craft
beer
thick
dark
black
imposing
with
dark
tan
rocky
head
looks
delicious
the
head
dissipates
relatively
quickly
leaving
spidery
to
continous
lace
the
aroma
is
strong
coffee
with
roasted
to
burnt
malt
and
a
little
smoke
the
initial
flavor
is
moderately
bitter
malt
that
has
the
coffee
but
not
as
much
as
you
expect
from
the
smell
the
coffee
flavor
increases
in
a
smooth
transition
to
a
burnt
maltcoffeebitter
hops
aftertaste
it
is
very
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
thick
creamy
texture
lively
carbonation
and
slightly
metallic
finish
overall
it
is
a
tasty
stout
that
is
surprisingly
well
balanced
considering
the
strong
coffee
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
strong
coffee
and
ot
overly
complex
otherwise
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
drink
very
often
this
was
my
first
beer
from
mikkeller
and
it
was
fantastic
got
their
stateside
ipa
coming
in
the
mail
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
that
too
highly
recommended
and
hopefully
breakfast
stouts
are
not
a
letdown
in
the
future
just
because
this
was
so
good
and
i
might
have
drank
the
best
one
first
i
can
not
say
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
kind
of
beer
in
the
morning
but
it
is
a
great
dessert
beer
grab
one
of
these
if
youy
ever
happen
to
find
it
i
am
glad
i
have
many
more
of
these
i
think
aging
for
about
6
more
months
will
help
mellow
out
the
alcohol
and
balance
the
flavors
a
bit
more
overall
a
good
beer
one
worthy
of
another
try
in
a
few
months
this
fine
stout
pours
a
glossy
nearblack
color
with
a
thick
and
rocky
light
brown
head
that
has
good
retention
nice
big
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
big
roasty
aroma
of
coffee
oats
and
chocolate
malt
rich
smooth
body
with
a
character
somewhere
between
an
oatmeal
stout
and
an
imperial
stout
flavors
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
hops
are
all
present
all
in
all
the
beer
manages
the
smooth
texture
and
flavor
of
an
oatmeal
stout
while
toying
with
the
robust
body
of
an
imperial
the
finish
is
moderately
bitter
coffee
and
hops
balanced
but
malt
and
chocolate
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
dif
you
dig
this
style
find
it
this
is
a
terrific
beer
although
i
could
probably
drink
more
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
have
just
one
and
really
enjoy
it
for
dessert
if
only
i
could
afford
to
have
one
every
night
the
members
of
the
scandinavian
brewers
guild
create
some
respectable
malt
beverages
now
if
they
can
lower
the
price
a
little
pours
an
absolute
opaque
onyx
black
with
a
huge
dark
brown
two
finger
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
thick
layer
that
lasts
stickiness
is
decent
but
doesnt
stay
long
smell
first
starts
off
with
a
strong
french
roast
scent
blended
with
frothy
whipped
cream
dark
chocolate
gooey
brownies
and
smoked
caramel
almonds
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
a
burnt
marshmallow
with
a
strong
espresso
sting
that
is
followed
up
by
a
quick
sweet
caramel
malt
that
is
then
dominated
by
the
smoke
flavors
again
big
bad
coffee
beer
i
see
why
it
should
be
for
breakfast
so
light
for
this
style
almost
too
watery
but
the
flavor
fits
it
so
well
if
you
like
your
mornin
cup
o
joe
this
brews
for
you
pitch
black
no
cream
no
sugar
wow
definite
geek
breakfast
i
had
waited
forever
to
try
this
one
the
first
time
my
wife
saw
the
bottle
in
the
fridge
she
thought
it
said
michaels
a
beer
geek
i
thought
it
was
appropriate
so
anyway
i
dove
into
this
one
last
night
poured
a
very
dark
black
with
a
nice
two
inch
tan
head
of
lace
and
a
great
side
glass
contribution
very
thick
looking
huge
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
coming
off
of
this
almost
a
vanilla
like
coffee
very
sweet
and
rich
aromas
the
flavor
was
very
full
lots
of
roasted
coffee
mixed
in
with
a
light
chocolate
mix
and
a
hint
of
a
hoppy
back
but
just
a
hint
very
rich
and
creamy
this
served
up
perfect
for
a
dessert
brew
it
was
a
bit
rough
finishing
the
whole
bottle
as
it
is
quite
thick
and
very
filling
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
i
compare
it
to
the
wake
and
bake
and
it
will
definitely
hold
its
own
though
this
one
is
definitely
not
as
strong
a
must
try
for
any
stout
lover
it
has
a
very
full
body
with
a
good
rich
and
creamy
flavor
this
one
was
definitely
not
to
be
missed
pick
it
up
if
you
can
get
it
very
good
breakfast
stout
all
around
not
on
the
level
of
the
founders
offerings
in
my
opinion
especially
considering
the
steep
price
but
solid
nonetheless
well
worth
seeking
out
a
bottle
the
texture
is
creamy
and
dense
with
a
lingering
heaviness
on
the
palate
absolutely
outstanding
im
so
happy
i
got
my
hands
on
some
of
this
stuff
one
of
the
best
beer
experiences
ive
had
pours
thick
rich
and
black
nice
creamybrown
head
i
hope
it
tastes
as
good
as
it
looks
pleasant
aromas
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
the
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
coffee
flavor
comes
through
with
a
nice
sharpness
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
not
very
apparent
it
seems
that
there
is
not
much
malt
flavor
nice
hop
finish
that
sits
in
the
roof
of
the
mouth
all
in
all
a
pleasant
brew
the
only
thing
that
i
did
not
enjoy
was
the
lack
of
real
oatmeal
stout
character
but
still
tasty
d
the
7
50
abv
is
moderate
enough
that
id
happily
deal
with
the
aftermath
of
3
or
so
bottles
the
coffee
and
stout
are
so
well
balanced
that
you
never
mind
either
one
you
must
find
this
it
is
imperative
do
it
as
though
your
life
depended
on
it
good
beer
from
mikkeller
i
sampled
this
right
after
sampling
a
founders
breakfast
stout
the
two
are
totally
different
beasts
and
i
like
the
direction
both
of
them
have
taken
hopefully
ill
be
drinking
some
more
mikkeller
brews
in
the
future
a
very
nice
and
well
balanced
brew
reminds
me
alot
of
the
breakfast
stout
just
not
as
hardcore
or
intense
coffee
and
chocolate
malty
and
oatmealy
come
through
blackhole
in
a
bottle
no
light
will
pierce
this
clean
brew
pours
a
12mm
tannish
brown
head
that
bubbles
away
quite
quickly
big
thanks
to
imstillthegman
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
rare
gem
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
nice
with
a
7
5abv
this
is
a
smooth
drinker
the
price
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
less
drinkable
a
tasty
sipper
but
i
would
recommend
this
to
be
paired
with
a
suitable
chocolate
desert
to
make
it
seem
more
lively
drinkability
this
is
a
slow
sipping
beer
that
has
some
bold
flavors
no
means
a
session
stout
but
it
is
a
enjoyable
beer
that
a
few
pints
can
be
had
poured
the
geek
at
cellar
temp
and
first
impression
is
a
very
dark
beer
with
some
great
viscosity
and
a
big
frothy
mocha
colored
head
the
head
seems
thick
yet
soft
a
great
coffee
aroma
but
not
as
overpowering
as
other
examples
as
this
one
also
presents
some
cocoa
vanilla
milk
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
tastes
very
much
like
the
aroma
some
coffee
upfront
with
some
roasted
malts
and
roasted
barley
it
has
a
nice
cocoa
and
slightly
bitter
and
dry
finish
this
beer
drinks
great
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
good
call
will
collect
more
d
quite
fantastic
i
needs
me
more
d
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
around
hands
down
find
this
at
all
costs
pours
black
as
oil
with
a
large
chocolate
milk
head
that
dies
slow
mmm
smells
of
roasted
coffee
beans
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
tastes
of
the
coffee
dark
chocolate
malt
oatmeal
and
finishes
with
ground
coffee
and
a
hop
bite
full
and
delicious
in
the
mouth
a
sipper
but
i
can
sip
on
multiples
of
this
coffee
stout
anyday
a
must
try
and
hits
a
soft
spot
i
have
for
these
stouts
22oz
bottle
from
florians
pitchblack
completely
opaque
body
with
a
good
inch
of
light
brown
head
the
first
completely
opaque
beer
ive
ever
had
smells
like
burnt
malt
and
good
coffee
tastes
like
burnt
and
roasted
malts
as
well
as
oatmeal
with
a
generous
dose
of
coffee
as
well
no
real
hop
or
alcohol
presence
here
this
stout
is
thick
you
could
cut
this
with
a
knife
and
fork
probably
the
thickest
feeling
carbonated
beer
ive
ever
encountered
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
big
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
one
sip
definitely
invites
another
like
few
beers
do
i
am
unbelievably
impressed
with
this
beer
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
it
it
exemplifies
everything
i
love
about
stouts
and
about
beer
in
general
a
new
favorite
i
could
drink
this
morning
noon
and
night
ill
be
buying
many
several
more
in
the
coming
weeks
and
rightfully
so
as
the
taste
is
delicious
even
at
830
am
its
a
great
beer
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
mouthfeel
delivered
a
bitter
finish
to
cap
off
a
viscous
creamy
body
with
the
perfect
amount
of
light
carbonation
if
this
beer
werent
so
damn
expensive
i
might
have
one
for
breakfast
every
day
amazingly
drinkable
especially
with
the
lower
alcohol
level
this
beer
is
black
eclipsing
the
light
im
holding
it
up
to
a
thick
creamy
chocolate
milk
shake
of
a
head
slowly
deflates
over
it
smells
a
lot
bigger
than
it
apparently
is
big
rich
chocolate
coffee
tar
molasses
an
entire
chocolatethemed
dessert
aroma
big
luscious
mouthful
of
sweet
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
bitter
dry
roastiness
of
the
coffee
that
lingers
towards
the
end
the
lightness
of
the
carbonation
and
its
smoothness
make
it
seem
really
full
bodied
but
it
really
floats
around
in
the
mouth
my
glass
is
empty
already
dammit
if
i
found
this
at
a
bar
it
would
be
very
hard
not
to
order
another
the
beer
pours
a
thick
murky
deep
black
with
a
decent
dark
tan
head
that
slowly
diminishes
the
aroma
is
a
great
blend
of
roasted
barley
espresso
and
very
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
also
a
blend
of
these
same
things
with
a
slight
edge
going
towards
the
roasted
barley
the
espresso
is
not
far
behind
however
the
beer
is
on
the
low
end
of
heavy
bodied
with
plenty
of
warming
alcohol
that
is
fairly
well
hidden
this
is
a
without
a
doubt
a
wonderful
stout
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
bottle
in
the
dead
of
winter
thanks
to
goldorak
for
the
bottle
pours
a
one
finger
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
totally
black
color
light
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
coffeemolasses
nose
flavor
is
a
balance
of
coffee
and
molasses
hints
of
sweetness
smooth
bakers
chocolate
aftertaste
great
to
try
but
pricey
at
14
00
for
a
22
3oz
659ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
pretty
drinkable
and
i
could
see
drinking
it
again
but
it
isnt
the
best
beer
of
this
type
consider
it
to
be
another
example
of
a
good
beer
at
the
price
point
13
there
are
a
lot
better
options
good
for
any
meal
lunch
dinner
or
breakfast
i
actually
finished
it
the
next
morning
still
good
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
since
i
first
spotted
it
on
the
shelf
and
i
finally
plunked
down
the
14
to
try
a
bomber
the
pour
is
a
not
surprising
inkyblack
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
reminds
me
of
bells
expedition
it
is
so
dark
the
smell
is
heavy
roasted
coffee
with
oats
lurking
at
the
edges
the
smell
is
really
good
if
you
like
coffee
the
taste
seems
to
be
more
oat
than
coffee
with
some
bitterness
like
dark
chocolate
at
the
end
and
then
the
coffee
coming
back
to
slap
you
in
the
face
the
mouthfeel
is
neither
too
thin
nor
too
syrupy
just
right
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
by
the
flavors
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
this
beats
founders
breakfast
stout
by
a
hair
or
two
this
was
worth
the
price
of
admission
but
only
for
one
viewing
if
you
are
a
coffeebeer
fan
then
you
should
probably
seek
this
one
out
black
rich
and
filling
easy
to
drink
delicious
a
beer
that
i
will
have
again
overall
a
fun
wellmade
beer
id
prefer
less
hops
and
more
coffee
though
never
thought
id
say
that
i
really
want
to
love
this
but
it
is
just
shy
of
an
awesome
beer
still
very
good
though
albeit
expensive
very
drinkable
if
you
are
a
fan
of
bold
coffees
and
stouts
this
beer
is
for
you
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
smells
great
overall
this
beer
is
great
aromatherapy
and
the
flavors
are
pure
bliss
it
seemed
a
bit
heavy
to
drink
on
a
hot
august
night
though
heavy
coffee
stouts
being
my
favorite
style
its
hard
for
me
not
to
like
it
but
without
being
biased
i
still
think
this
is
a
very
well
done
brew
other
comments
this
is
a
damn
near
perfect
beer
a
real
beer
geek
stunner
would
be
really
interesting
to
age
this
beer
for
a
while
unfortunately
i
only
bought
one
bottle
it
was
4
50
but
well
worth
the
price
tag
interestingly
i
happened
to
be
eating
a
continental
lunch
of
cured
meats
olives
brie
balsamic
olive
oil
and
black
grapes
this
beer
went
strangely
well
with
the
meal
and
the
black
grapes
in
particular
served
at
cellar
temperature
into
a
snifter
from
a
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
poured
a
deep
midnight
black
with
about
a
two
finger
thick
coffee
brown
crown
on
top
of
the
beer
head
dissapated
somewhat
slowly
and
left
plenty
of
thick
sticky
lace
behind
smell
very
thick
roasted
coffee
aroma
hits
you
right
in
the
nose
the
coffee
aroma
was
mixed
with
cocoa
almond
vanilla
and
charred
wood
taste
a
rich
shot
of
bitter
espresso
dark
chocolate
a
touch
of
vanilla
extract
and
some
more
smokey
tones
with
a
bit
of
noticeable
hops
in
the
rather
smooth
finish
very
little
of
the
7
5
alcohol
was
noticed
lightly
carbonated
was
pretty
smooth
clean
and
full
bodied
had
a
bit
of
a
creaminess
to
it
nicely
balanced
with
great
drinkability
drinkability
what
a
great
beer
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
i
highly
recommend
it
the
beer
drinks
smooth
too
smooth
one
could
drink
many
of
these
in
an
evening
the
taste
offered
up
hints
of
chocolate
and
oat
of
course
the
coffee
flavor
bursts
on
the
scene
you
get
a
smidge
of
hops
in
the
finish
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
d
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
highly
drinkable
as
the
7
5
is
not
evident
at
all
and
could
make
for
a
dangerous
breakfast
but
i
would
prefer
pairing
this
as
an
after
dinner
treat
or
with
a
chocolatey
dessert
i
would
like
to
see
more
from
mikkeller
stateside
overall
impression
a
bold
balanced
coffeeflavored
oatmeal
stout
the
coffee
is
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
like
many
other
examples
a
good
beer
but
too
overhyped
black
as
demon
blood
with
an
imposingly
large
cap
of
dark
khaki
foam
all
thick
and
frothy
underneath
an
initial
vegetal
fresh
hop
bouquet
lay
aromas
of
black
roasted
grains
baking
cocoa
coffee
burnt
chicory
root
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
largely
composed
of
bitter
slightly
sour
flavors
at
first
with
pineyleafy
hops
swirling
around
blackened
malts
and
unsweetened
cocoa
with
a
noticeable
coffee
presence
at
the
finish
sharp
mineral
twang
upon
swallowing
with
a
decidedly
bittersour
green
hop
character
in
the
aftertaste
as
this
stout
warms
its
initially
angular
edges
begin
to
soften
with
sweeter
more
chocolatey
malt
flavors
emerging
particularly
at
the
beginning
of
the
sip
very
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
substantial
and
full
on
the
palate
with
an
expected
silkiness
from
the
oatmeal
at
present
this
is
an
interesting
coffee
stout
but
the
hop
presence
is
a
bit
much
for
me
as
is
id
like
to
get
another
bottle
to
cellar
for
about
a
year
so
that
the
hops
would
fade
allowing
the
darker
chocolate
and
vinous
fruit
notes
that
surreptitiously
linger
to
come
forward
a
bit
more
however
at
14
a
bottle
i
dont
know
how
likely
that
will
be
22
oz
bomber
this
beer
pours
viscous
and
black
as
any
beer
i
have
ever
seen
there
is
a
dark
brown
head
a
finger
and
a
half
tall
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
over
top
of
the
brew
light
has
no
chance
to
penetrate
this
brew
it
is
sinister
looking
to
say
the
least
i
dont
see
any
bubbles
in
the
brew
but
that
may
be
as
much
due
to
the
viscosity
and
color
than
anything
else
the
aroma
is
focused
towards
a
dense
pine
hop
and
a
background
of
deep
roast
and
darkroasted
coffee
beans
it
is
an
interesting
combination
of
the
three
taking
a
sip
there
is
a
big
dose
of
pine
and
very
green
tasting
hop
to
start
this
moves
to
a
chocolate
and
roast
finishing
with
a
mild
sweetened
coffee
and
a
second
coming
of
the
green
quality
of
the
hop
the
bitter
from
hop
and
coffee
blend
well
on
the
finish
and
neither
is
overpowering
letting
it
sit
on
my
palette
a
little
there
is
a
creamlaced
coffee
flavor
that
comes
through
more
as
the
lingering
flavors
recede
it
is
interesting
i
would
like
there
to
be
more
of
a
coffee
focus
as
i
feel
that
the
hop
plays
too
central
a
role
in
the
flavor
for
what
i
was
expecting
with
the
name
and
the
coffee
beans
on
the
label
mouthfeel
is
incredible
i
almost
feel
like
i
am
chewing
this
beer
before
i
can
swallow
it
thick
is
not
even
close
to
describe
the
feel
of
this
one
there
is
a
very
mild
carbonation
in
there
that
just
barely
stings
my
tongue
i
do
not
recall
any
other
beers
that
are
this
dense
for
the
big
flavors
and
the
massive
body
this
one
has
very
good
drinkability
the
abv
is
a
little
lower
than
i
might
expect
for
the
style
but
i
think
that
helps
out
and
it
certainly
keeps
the
body
as
thick
as
it
is
im
a
happy
man
to
be
drinking
this
beer
right
now
beer
out
of
scandanavia
is
something
new
to
me
which
is
a
shame
the
heavy
malty
beers
that
come
out
of
this
place
have
been
outstanding
but
rather
than
being
an
eyecatching
beast
from
the
outside
they
are
tame
but
give
you
your
moneys
worth
highly
recommended
pours
inky
dark
brownish
black
with
cascading
sparkling
brown
creamy
tan
2inch
head
smell
is
toasted
malty
flavors
creamy
dark
chocolate
the
taste
on
this
one
is
very
smooth
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
smooth
creamy
cup
of
iced
coffee
very
enjoyable
to
start
the
day
with
22oz
of
this
one
nice
to
drink
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
after
dinner
coffee
and
if
it
wasnt
in
22oz
bottles
i
could
see
having
one
for
breakfast
22oz
at
7
5
might
make
for
a
slow
work
day
d
this
beer
does
have
a
rich
malty
flavor
and
the
coffee
flavor
is
very
good
at
complimenting
the
malt
the
coffee
is
very
present
but
it
does
not
overpower
the
beer
very
nice
drinking
big
stout
i
think
the
beer
was
designed
to
be
reviewed
it
pours
out
engine
oil
black
with
a
small
but
thick
head
the
head
was
dark
brown
and
looked
like
chocolate
milk
the
smells
of
coffee
and
almonds
were
very
potent
as
to
be
expected
i
let
this
beer
warm
up
a
little
before
drinking
it
because
i
though
the
cold
work
mask
some
of
the
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
lasts
a
long
time
after
swallowing
it
has
the
perfect
blend
of
malt
to
go
down
smooth
and
then
hit
you
with
a
ton
of
the
coffee
and
sugar
flavor
defiantly
had
some
really
bad
breath
after
this
one
its
a
great
blend
of
ingredients
not
to
much
one
way
or
the
other
a
really
good
beer
pours

thanks
martin
well
it
is
named
correctly
enough
tasty
but
a
bit
overthetop
for
too
much
of
share
this
with
another
beer
geek
for
breakfastbrunch
in
my
opinion
dark
horse
makes
a
fine
double
stout
that
rivals
this
one
founders
breakfast
stout
also
rivals
this
and
for
the
price
i
prefer
these
two
mi
beers
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
although
at
7
5
it
would
be
a
punch
in
the
brain
as
a
breakfast
beer
drinkabilityid
like
another
this
beer
poured
as
black
as
the
night
and
no
light
is
getting
through
this
one
it
formed
a
huge
dark
brown
foarm
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
coffee
chocolate
some
burnt
aspect
along
a
wood
chips
line
the
flavor
was
of
malt
chocolate
anise
and
a
touch
of
pepper
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
bittersweet
finish
a
very
nice
beer
but
a
little
to
pricey
to
consider
more
than
once
or
twice
so
the
scarcity
of
it
wont
bother
me
that
much
later
still
love
it
but
i
think
the
danes
are
trying
too
hard
to
make
their
stouts
stouty
ease
up
on
the
black
patent
a
little
one
delicious
drinkable
stout
here
coffee
leaves
an
astringent
tannin
finish
but
its
not
overwhelming
only
problem
i
see
in
the
taste
not
overly
complex
but
overly
drinkable
and
delicious
double
shot
espresso
with
caramel
syrup
and
french
vanilla
accents

as
well
as
tannic
with
some

bitterness
considering
this
is
only
7
5
and
tastes
this
good
im
afraid
this
is
an
all
day
occasion
if
you
can
find
enough
of
these
beauties
bottle
poured

foamy

with
some
really
good
retention
and
some

dry
coffee
is
well
mix
with
some
light

note
taste
is
a
nicer
mix
between
some
dry
coffee
and
some
nice
lightly
sweet
roasted
malt
body
has
a
great
creamy
texture
which
really
fits
with
the
style
i
also
found
that
this
beer
had
some
great
carbonation
with
no
alcohol
being
discernable
i
have
to
admit
that
this
beer
was
well
brewed
with
some
great
balance
between
coffee
and
malt
with
a
nice
texture
d
when
i
want
to
drink
beer
but
pretend
i
am
having
coffee
this
is
the
beer
im
gonna
want
to
drink
while
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
i
think
that
the
aroma
is
better
it
is
richer
and
fuller
with
a
better
complexity
to
it
if
the
complete
beer
lived
up
to
the
initial
aroma
this
beer
would
be
just
about
perfect
the
mouthfeel
of
this
seemed
to
fizzle
a
bit
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
ultimately
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
just
that
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
this
promised
to
be
a
stunning
beauty
of
beer
or
perhaps
better
said
is
started
out
so
decadent
and
rich
but
then
took
on
a
lighter
tone
as
most
beer
geeks
know
it
is
better
to
have
the
lighter
less
powerful
beers
first
in
a
session
and
move
ones
way
up
to
the
more
powerful
brews
not
the
other
way
around
like
this
brew
seems
to
do
as
it
is
though
it
is
still
a
great
beer
one
which
i
would
be
happy
to
have
easy
access
to
the
highlight
of
the
night
thanks
sammy
thanks
for
the
sample
sammy
saved
over
freom
annual
trade
with
madsberg
an
excellent
stout
with
coffee
aroma
dark
and
roasty
with
giant
head
that
is
soapy
then
there
is
some
lace
high
perceptable
alcohol
there
and
chocolate
and
chocolate
malt
creamy
taste
oatmeal
a
tad
smoke
perfect
coffee
and
unbelievable
overall
balance
aroma
is
big
with
quality
roasted
coffee
and
roasted
malts
hints
of
darker
fruits
and
even
a
tinge
of
blueberry
are
also
present
after
this
a
lighter
wave
of
dark
chocolate
follows
quite
a
range
pf
aromas
here
excellent
smell
that
is
made
unique
by
that
mild
fruitblueberry
accent
body
is
very
slightly
brown
tinted
black
and
the
head
is
a
full
three
fingers
thick
creamy
and
bubbly
mocha
affair
that
is
quite
lasting
fore
is
tart
and
acidic
then
strongly
bitter
with
a
blast
of
coffee
that
fruity
sweetness
from
the
aroma
appears
int
he
middle
but
it
is
more
sugar
sweet
than
blueberryfruit
sweet
the
coffee
notes
dominate
and
while
this
has
a
certain
smoothness
it
doesnt
immediately
strike
me
as
an
oatmeal
beer
the
finish
is
a
blast
of
dark
chocolate
and
very
bitter
strong
dark
cofffee
i
dont
want
to
say
it
is
a
let
down
because
it
is
a
fine
beer
but
the
overall
package
wasnt
as
sublime
as
i
anticipated
mouthfeel
is
roasty
mildly
thin
with
a
coffee
like
bitterness
lingering
around
taste
malt
profile
is
rich
roasted
with
plenty
of
dark
highcocoa
content
chocolate
and
again
the
hops
really
make
their
presence
known
without
messing
things
up
i
wouldnt
have
thought
this
mix
would
work
but
then
again
i
know
tons
of
people
who
go
for
the
onetwo
punch
of
a
tall
glass
of
oj
with
an
expresso
chaser
in
the
morning
kudos
to
the
brewer
who
had
the
balls
to
give
this
a
shot
make
it
turn
out
great
and
name
it
with
a
friendly
wink
to
his
niche
clientele
personally
and
im
not
an
expert
in
this
style
but
it
tastes
like
a
grill
in
a
bad
way
grease
smoke
and
more
grease
o
the
smoke
plays
more
of
a
support
role
here
and
it
actually
helps
enhance
the
dark
chocolate
sweetness
and
the
coffee
well
done
o
not
a
bad
little
brew
but
the
bitter
taste
isnt
blending
with
the
other
flavours
well
smoke
actually
doesnt
have
the
biggest
influence
on
the
palate
but
it
is
recognizable
in
an
enjoyable
interaction
with
the
malts
adding
an
unusal
flavor
to
this
great
beer
arguing
from
the
perspective
of
loving
a
typical
bamberg
smoked
beer
this
smoked
stout
entirely
lacks
the
characteristic
hints
of
saltiness
it
is
even
more
astonishing
that
it
doesnt
need
those
because
of
the
complex
coffee
flavor
which
stays
in
balance
due
to
the
malty
smokiness
enough
complexity
is
established
in
a
different
way
than
they
do
it
in
bamberg
the
coffee
flavor
of
this
beer
might
already
be
enough
to
make
this
great
as
it
is
very
smooth
almost
creamy
intense
flavoured
and
changes
its
taste
on
the
palate
during
the
tasting
process
intensely
smoked
lots
of
wood
peat
pork
and
bacon
flavor
moderate
roasted
malt
and
coffee
blends
well
with
the
smoky
notes
well
balanced
overall
one
of
the
better
smoked
beers
ive
had
t
smokey
as
hell
bitter
bitter
coffee
and
thats
really
about
it
bacon
flavor
doesnt
taste
great
the
beauty
of
these
really
dark
beers
is
that
when
i
employ
an
aggro
pour
the
pseudocascade
is
extremely
visible
i
sat
back
in
awe
and
watched
it
settle
into
two
fingers
of
very
dense
deeptanlightbrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
an
opaque
black
srm
44
and
it
looked
like
the
depths
of
outer
space
in
my
glass
nose
was
very
coffeelike
with
just
a
modicum
of
underlying
smokiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
while
the
coffee
was
still
prevalent
on
the
tongue
the
smoke
was
beginning
to
assert
itself
in
the
mouth
and
in
my
sinus
cavity
warming
the
smoke
got
stronger
but
so
did
the
coffee
i
was
really
hoping
for
something
much
smokier
but
since
it
is
listed
as
an
oatmeal
stout
o
very
good
beer
i
am
not
a
big
smoked
beer
fan
out
side
of
smoke
and
dagger
from
jacks
abby
which
is
a
mild
smoked
flavor
comparatively
o
if
you
like
smoked
coffee
this
beer
is
for
you
very
smoky
huge
coffee
notes
wow
i
am
not
a
huge
smoked
beer
fan
but
this
stands
up
to
the
style

worth
a
try
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
series
so
far
o
very
drinkable
smoked
beer
which
base
is
great

this
stout
is
very
drinkable
really
good
beer
pours
a
black

slight

slight

smells
of
hops
sweet

slight
roasted

hint
of
alcohol
hint
of
smoke
and
hint
of
floral
notes
this
is
more
the
style
of
smoked
beer
than
an
oatmeal
stout
though
it
doesnt
fit
easily
into
either
category
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
dryness
tastes
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
hint
of
smoke
slight
hops
and
slight
alcohol
overall
good
body
blend
and
aroma
but
the
smoke
is
almost
an
afterthought
truly
a
beer
described
and
tastes
as
labelled
missing
only
a
bit
of
creamy
palate
feel
to
match
otherwise
a
blast

light

has
some
peaty

character
finishes
with
light
grassy

and
boiled
down
coffee
with
a
light
residual
smokiness
medium
bodied
an
interesting
coffee
stout
with
a
somewhat
lighter

and
body
than
expected
from
an
oatmeal
stout
the
malt
complement
does
not
quite
support
the
smoke
and
coffee
flavors
although
they
are
not
that
intense
i
enjoyed
this
but
was
left
wishing
for
a
more
intense
malty
stout
body
to
play
off
the
additional
flavors
a
well
made
coffee
stout
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the

pours
pitch

massive

goes

lots
of
earthy
coffee
glorious
flavor
is
chocolate
and
coffee
up

with
a
nice
bittersweet
balance
earthy
coffee
really
comes
out
as
my
palate
gets
used
to
the
smoke
a
rich
oatmeal
sweetness
lots
of
roasty
malts
then
a
big
punch
of
smoke
that
lingers
on
the
palate
until
forever
just
a
flavor
explosion
of
all
kinds
but
the
smokiness
complements
the
other
flavors
beautifully
relatively
rich
mouthfeel
with
low
medium
carbonation
but
plenty
drinkable
probably
my
favorite
of
the
beer
geeks
i
have
tried
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
my
least
favor
of
the
series
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the

down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
smoked
malt
toasted
oat
cocoa
and
citrus

aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
smoke
cocoa
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
smoke
presence
that
is
more
apparent
in
the
aroma
overall
theres
a
lot
going
on
including
some
off
notes
it
doesnt
mesh
really
well
and
the
bitter
roast
is
a
bit
overwhelming
this
beer
holds
it
own
by
being
packed
with
flavors
at
7
5
abv
a
wonderfully
delicious
take
on
the
series
well
now
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
a
pretty
damn
fine
smoked
beer
rich
and
dark
with
a
hefty
malt
backbone
and
a
nice
thoroughly
integrated
smokiness
throughout
i
dont
know
how
long
this
particular
brew
may
be
available
but
being
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
ill
definitely
pick
up
another
couple
of
bottles
at
coaltrain
wine
and
spirits
in
colorado
springs
to
supplement
my
stash
of
aecht
schlenkerla
smoked
beers
this
one
may
not
quite
reach
the
heights
of
the
bavarian
standard
but
its
not
too
far
off
the
mark
d
good
not
great
like
all
of
mikkellers
beers
way
overpriced
looking
back
i
probably
would
have
passed
as
i
was
hoping
for
much
more
of
a
smokey
brew
yep
another
beer
geek
incarnation
a
splendid
one
too
big
dark
brown
bodied
oatmeal
stout
with
a
frothy
milkshake
tan
head
and
intense
smoke
aromatics
its
like
an
oatmeal
stout
meets
a
campfire
evoking
notions
of
brisket
and
pork
butt
on
the
slow
fire
its
meaty
in
that
way
almost
primitive
yet
refined
in
a
way
that
only
mikkeller
can
execute
big
bold
zesty
flavors
from
the
charred
barley
and
a
coffee
addition
appears
evident
as
full
bodied
as
they
get
and
at
7
5
its
sturdy
enough
for
cold
winter
drinking
some
people
dream
of
curling
up
with
a
book
and
a
cup
of
tea
on
a
grey
day
in
january
i
will
now
dream
of
curling
up
with
this
beer
and
a
hockey
game
masculine
and
aggressive
but
patient
and
contemplative
as
well
an
overall
exceptional
stout
from
mikkeller
one
that
i
look
forward
to
getting
into
again
soon
o
a
little
weak
on
the
smoke
aspect
especially
when
it
collides
with
the
coffee
and
bitterness
in
the
midpalate
the
way
that
it
does
its
also
more
of
a
burnt
smoke
than
bacon
or
meaty
smoke
which
is
interesting
considering
the
namealias
of
the
beer
that
aside
its
still
a
good
coffee
stout
with
some
desirable
qualities
also
its
one
of
very
few
mikkeller
brews
that
are
decently
affordable
not
that
5
99
for
a
330
ml
bottle
is
really
affordable
but
it
is
for
mikkeller
nice
to
try
if
youre
into
the
regular
bgb
or
just
a
fan
of
mikkeller
but
aside
from
that
there
are
better
smoked
beers
to
be
had
d
great
overall
balance
with
the
bacon
flavors
overall
a
subtly
smoked
oatmeal
stout
with
pronounced
roasted
grain
qualities

bam
this
brew
assaults
your
palate
like
a
batallion
of
smokeinfused
coffee
ninjas
insistantly
demanding
your
attention
crazy
stuff
coffee
rauchmalt
and
roasted
grain
all
laced
with
soy
its
fair
to
say
that
it
lives
up
to
its
name
there
is
more
than
a
hint
of
bacon
in
the
aroma
and
a
whiff
in
the
flavour
as
well
overall
though
the
coffee
and
smoked
malt
sit
uneasily
together
and
compete
rather
than
complement
the
result
is
inspired
but
imperfect
it
lacks
the
incredible
silky
smoothness
of
beer
geek
breakfast
however
it
remains
a
unique
and
worthy
brew
dont
pass
it
up
if
you
see
it
o
a
nice
beer
it
was
hard
to
drink
16
oz
of
it
though
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
the
smell
was
incredible
smokey
bacony
earthy
and
something
roasted
like
peat
moss
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
strong
as
the
smell
but
id
say
thats
because
it
was
smooth
and
wellbalanced
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
id
have
this
brew
again
and
again
o
its
a
good
beer
and
interesting
but
nothing
spectacular
somewhat
let
down
by
this
one
wont
be
getting
it
again

the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
mediumbodied
its
not
bad
really
just
lacking
in
body
primarily
overall
this
is
a
solid
enjoyable
impy
stout
its
got
pleasant
coffeedominant
flavor
with
a
nice
baconlike
accent
worth
a
shot
o
a
solid
smokey
beer
i
love
the
smoke
and
tis
is
one
to
keep
in
stock
if
you
can
find
it
o
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
from
the
aromas
and
surprisingly
boozy
but
this
is
still
a
good
interesting
brew
d
the
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
smoky
to
the
point
that
i
was
dreading
the
flavor
but
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
such
intense
peat
character
the
smoke
in
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
provides
a
nice
balance
and
contrast
for
the
dry
caramel
malt
components
two
finger
milk
chocolate
colored
head
with
little
retention
on
a
jet
black
body
aroma
is
a
little
off
putting
the
mesquite
aroma
is
more
like
raid
insectacide
by
my
nose
i
cant
get
much
else
from
it
when
drinking
the
flavor
actually
makes
the
aroma
better
the
flavor
is
a
very
nice
smokey
mesquite
bacon
taste
which
is
actually
mellow
and
not
over
done
making
this
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
in
this
genre
that
i
have
had
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
i
know
my
rating
is
high
but
for
the
genre
this
is
excellent
thought
this
was
pretty
good
better
than
the
hop
one
but
not
as
good
as
the
first

overall
this
is
a
very
nice

nice
balance
and
robustness

very
drinkable

well
enjoyed
this
one

pours
a
very
thick

with

goes

smokey

and
burnt

aromas
charred

and
dark

scents
with
some
dark

more

is
just
as
smokey
as
the

just

some

not
bad
the

smoke
make
up
for
it
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
fullbodied
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
great
smoked
stout
i
like
this
one
more
than
beer
geek
breakfast
and
brunch
weasel
like
it
sure
overall
this
is
tasty
but
not
mindblowing
the
nose
was
like
whoa
but
the
beer
was
just
good
o
i
like
this
beer
im
not
blown
away
but
its
super
interesting
and
i
love
all
of
the
smoke
and
roast
in
this
beer
uggh
i
just
got
a
mouthful
of
little
brown
sludgy
bits
gross
im
gonna
have
to
bring
it
down
a
peg
now
o
excellent
smoked
beer
great
on
its
own
or
as
a
compliment
to
a
hearty
meal
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
in
my
opinion
i
would
like
to
give
west
lakeview
liquors
in
chicago
for
recommending
this
to
me
i
would
say
i
normally
dont
really
enjoy
mikkellers
beers
but
this
one
was
very
solid
beers
like
this
make
me
want
to
see
what
else
they
have
to
offer
merry
christmas
to
me
overall
for
me
the
taste
brings
the
beer
down
a
lot
it
was
just
way
to
smokey
felt
like
i
was
drinking
an
ash
tray
it
had
a
nice
aroma
and
look
to
it
but
i
was
disappointed
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
stout
with
a
large
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
malt
with
rich
roasted
dry
malt
notes
is
quite
interesting
though
not
as
overthetop
as
expecting
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
smoked
flavours
and
notes
of
dry
coffee
body
is
full
with
nice
creamy
texture
and
good
carbonation
very
well
brewed
with
nice
mix
between
smoked
flavour
and
notes
of
roasted
malt
also
this
beer
has
got
quite
a
body
considering
the
low
abv
o
smokey
brews
are
no
longer
on
my
to
buy
list
this
one
is
way
overwhelming
too
much
smoke
and
not
enough
good
eclectic
flavors
not
worth
hunting
o
great
after
dinner
or
for
beakfast
as
the
name
implies
despite
how
smokey
it
is
its
never
overpowering
or
cloying
this
was
really
great
there
is
a
lot
of
smokey
flavor
going
on
with
this
beer
its
important
to
know
that
going
in
not
as
much
of
a
thick
body
as
it
looks
and
sounds
like
itd
have
making
it
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
love
me
some
rauch
although
this
interpretation
wasnt
wholly
satisfying
d
i
think
they
went
a
step
too
far
with
smoking
such
a
dark
brew
the
smoke
clashed
with
instead
of
complimented
the
darker
qualities
coffee
chocolate
etc
an
interesting
beer
but
not
the
best
mikkeller
out
there
do
not
want
overall
the
bacon
and
coffee
flavors
i
think
were
overpowered
by
the
smokiness
stale
coffee
and
overcooked
bacon
perhaps
can
be
detected
but
thats
not
what
i
wanted
i
want
breakfast
in
a
bottle
with
some
nice
hops
overall
smokedominated
i
long
for
the
stout
inside
and
wheres
the
coffee
less
smoke
would
give
this
a
hint
of
bacon
but
its
so
smokey
i
dont
even
think
of
bacon
overall
a
little
bit
over
the
top
for
me
the
smoke
is
just
too
overpowering
interesting
but
probably
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
oreally
unique
but
well
put
together
strong
flavors
playing
off
each
other
well
overall
i
have
to
stick
with
weasal
as
my
favorite
still
but
this
was
a
well
done
combination
of
styles
and
ingredients
i
love
what
mikkeller
puts
out
i
like
rauch
beers
in
general
and
this
beer
a
lot
wish
it
was
a
bit
less
pricey
and
i
could
buy
it
more
often
not
always
in
the
mood
but
when
i
am
this
one
hits
the
spot
very
black
with
a
big
brown
head
that
sticks
around
lacing
is
good
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
smoke
roasted
malt
coffee
the
smoke
isnt
overpowering
here
or
in
the
tasting
in
fact
its
very
well
balanced
for
this
style
with
a
subtle
bacony

underneath
the
coffee

not
anything

detracts

vague
maple

hints
underneath
it
all
complex
and
delicious
fairly
thick
slightly
coating
in
the
mouth
smooth
and
a
little
oily
satisfying
feel
this
isnt
going
to
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
and
i
wouldnt
want
it
everyday
but
it
sure
hits
the
spot
when
the
mood
strikes
one
is
going
to
be
enough
unless
youre
a
rauch
freak
had
this
last
on
a
cold
mountain
evening
with
a
platter
of
smoked
and
unsmoked
cheeses
nice
crackers
and
charcuterie
my
wife
bought
this
at
the
foodery
in
philadelphia
for
me
birthday
i
poured
from
the
1
pint
9
fluid
ounce
bottle
into
an
allamerican
pint
glass
darkness
to
the
point
of
opacity
with
a
thick
tan
head
if
you
are
enjoying
this
for
breakfast
you
will
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
but
the
smoky
notes
were
subdued
but
wait
get
a
mouthful
and
there
they
are
delicious
roasty
smoky
goodness
a
lovely
balance
of
the
coffee
stout
and
smoke
swimming
in
the
chewy
but
notquitethick
lay
on
the
tongue
i
found
a
certain
peatyness
reminiscent
of
a
single
malt
scotch
lovely
overall
another
great
coffee
stout
the
smoked
element
overpowers
much
of
the
coffee
but
is
reigned
in
a
bit
by
the
oatmeals
creaminess
overall
not
sure
how
much
i
like
this
brew
it
may
just
be
that
i
would
have
preferred
this
beer
to
have
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
in
play
to
help
balance
the
very
bitter
coffeecocoa
and
heavy
smoke
flavors
i
wish
this
were
sweeter
and
richer
mostly
a
bitter
oatmeal
stout
with
some
smoke
i
was
expecting
more
had
as
rauch
geek
breakfast
which
is
labeled
an
oatmeal
stout
whatever
strong
smoky
aroma
has
tones
of
coffee
molasses
and
hickory
it
pours
a
deep
nearly
black
opaque
sable
with
a
very
thick
and
finebubbled
dark
tan
head
as
for
the
flavor
imagine
drinking
a
highquality
mocha
thats
been
spiked
now
add
a
generous
helping
of
hickory
smoke
and
pinches
of
nutty
caramel
and
licorice
flavors
fullbodied
texture
has
a
strong
fizz
and
leaves
behind
a
firm
persistent
tingle
catch
this
one
while
you
can
pours
black
with
ample
compact
and
very
dark
brown
head
diminishes
to
a
thin
film
and
ring
overall
solid
retention
and
minimal
lacing
has
a
smokey
and
roasted
character
which
reminds
me
of
barbecued
meat
taste
is
similarly
smokey
and
roasted
with
a
slight
undertone
of
vanilla
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
a
bit
too
high
for
the
style
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
roastysmokey
stout
pretty
light
on
the
coffee
considering
coffee
was
added
and
nonexistent
chocolate
presence
what
is
the
difference
between
a
hop
bitterness
and
a
coffee
bitterness
i
cant
tell
in
this
beer
wherever
it
comes
from
it
lingers
for
a
little
bit
there
is
a
sweetness
that
is
similar
to
a
spoonful
of
sugar
and
a
splash
of
cream
that
kinda
takes
the
edge
off
actually
there
arent
a
lot
of
edges
just
a
lot
of
charred
flavors
that
arent
subtle
the
way
all
of
the
flavors
mix
isnt
very
good
to
me
at
this
time
from
the
first
sip
im
loving
it
the
smoke
comes
through
and
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
theres
a
lingering
finish
its
sharp
dry
and
delicious
i
may
just
have
to
get
another
one
of
these
and
soon
bummer
i
love
the
concept
but
it
was
surprisingly
light
in
body
and
lacked
richness
and
balance
mostly
though
it
was
the
texture
it
was
like
beer
geek
tapioca
roasty
which
is
also
what
makes
it
great
it
is
good
enough
that
i
would
definitely
have
another

low

the
verbal

othis

a
pretty
good
take
on
an
oatmeal
stout
it
may
not
be
the
most
complex
or
intriguing
beer
in
the
world
but
the
oats
are
well
done
if
a
bit
heavy
handed
and
the
beer
drinks
like
you
think
an

would

of
the

a

the

still

finish
is

overall
this
is

profile
it
has
all
the
welcome
flavors
of
the

and
balances
them
well
the

on

overall
impression
of

is
of
a
very
true
to
form
oatmeal
stout
that
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
it
hits
the
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
quite
well
and
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
a
very

a

this

the
best

i
ever

to

absolutely
heavy

very
little

this
is
what
i
drink
every
day
i
accept
no
substitute
i
always
pour
it
a
little
fast
so
the
tan
head
is
nice
and
thick
there
is
nothing
light
and
watery
about
this
beer
o
a
quality
choice
in
the
oatmeal
stout
world
good
flavor

aromas
of
coffee

chocolate
with
bits
of

i
expected
from

a
touch
of
chocolate

a
hint
of

medium

with

and
a

somewhat
creamy

decent
brew
but
seems
a
bit
lacking
in
body
and
mouthfeel
o
good
beer
not
particularly
memorable
but
a
good
specimen
of
its
class
overall
i
do
like
this
oatmeal
stout
as
i
think
its
on
par
with
8
ball
stout
and
some
others
pretty
good
o
a
delicious
stout

love
to
have
a

this
is
a
very
nice
porter
with
a
vanilla
twist
a
very
well
done
oatmeal
stout
nothing
too
complex
going
on
in
the
taste
but
what
is
there
is
quite
enjoyable
not
a
huge
stout
or
porter
guy
really
dig
dipas
and
ales
but
this
brew
got
me
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
tankhaki
head
chocolate
and
malt
notes
come
to
the
nose
a
nicely
balanced
stout
that
tastes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
and
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
my
favorite
stout
for
sure
prost
lampertland
overall
a
highly
well
balanced
stout
the
only
thing
wrong
might
be
the
thin
and
burnt
tastes
and
also
nothing
makes
it
stand
out
its
a
good
example
of
a
stout
one
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
exceptional
or
exceptionally
different
definitely
try
this
one
though
it
could
turn
out
to
be
a
favorite
the
first
words
that
come
to
mind
upon
taking
a
sniff
and
a
sip
of
oatis
are

bodied
and
sweeter
than
expected
with
a
prominent
chocolate
flavor
that
compliments
the
dark
roasted
notes
lots
of
oatmeal
as
well
as
some
coffee

so
its
super
cheap
at
my
local
dont

how
long
that
will

their

are

and

the

it
works
in
this
beer
for

for
as
many
flavors
im
getting
however
it
really
lacks
what
youre

this
is
a

mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
just
below
medium
bodied
with
pretty
fine
carbonation
reasonably
smooth
drinking
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
all
of
the
flavors
are
on
par
with
the
style
nothing
offputting
at
all
drink
pretty
good
but
was
expecting
a
bit
more
very
drinkable
and
had
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
that
were
palatable
and
tasty
cant
say
im
overly
impressed
with
this
offering
from
ninkasi
especially
if
you
compare
it
to
the
level
that
portsmouth
has
for
their
oatmeal
stout
final
notes
this
beer
was
pleasing
in
every
way
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
and
i
hope
to
add
it
to
my
rotation
a
bit
pricey
and
pretty
alcoholic
but
worth
it
d
great
beer
well
balanced
nothing
to
complain
about
here
d
this
ones
very
easy
drinking
but
nothing
really
stands
out
here
an
overall
middleoftheroad
offering
worth
a
try
but
nothing
much
to
say
about
it
besides
that
pours
a
jet
black
with
medium
tan
head
that
diminishes
fast
awesome
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
aromas
coming
from
this
beer
i
also
get
coffee
and
biscuits
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
and
huge
oatmeal
flavor
the
oatmeal
goes
great
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
i
also
get
slight
vanilla
and
caramel
flavors
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
an
oatmeal
stout
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
drinkability
is
very
high
pretty
hoppy
for
an
oatmeal
stout
leads
to
the
linger
being
way
too
long
malts
really
do
taste
burnt
at
first
and
the
bitterness
really
takes
over
although
i
may
have
been
spoiled
by
some
very
good
oatmeal
stouts
lately
the
chacteristic
mouthfeel
of
an
oatmeal
stout
isnt
quite
there
possibly
thrown
off
by
the
hops
in
the
end
it
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
finish
d
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
overall
but
not
a
great
beer
a
fairly
plain
stout
goes
down
smooth
and
disappears
quickly
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
the
taste
makes
me
want
more
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
but
definitely
good
and
would
get
it
again
d
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
a
bomber
at
a
time
but
very
enjoyable
verdict
although
not
trying
to
dazzle
you
with
tricks
this
is
one
of
the
most
welldone
stouts
america
has
to
offer
as
a
regular
mf
texture
is
sweet
but
not
the
typical
fullbody
that
you
might
expect
in
an
oatmeal
stout
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
creamy
but
it
drinks
like
a
little
like
a
porter
pretty
deceptive
in
its
abv
and
definitely
a
delicious
beer
i
thought
this
was
quite
nice
for
what
it
was
powdery
cocoa
on
the
front
palate
nice
and
slick
some
pleasant
earth
and
oat
dust
on
the
tongue
a
return
to
cocoa
on
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
anise
mouthfeel
is
slick
a
tad
thin
not
as
full
and
creamy
or
smooth
as
id
like
for
the
style
still
a
tasty
beer
though
fairly
bitter
and
too
roasty
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
really
craves
some
mouthfeelbody
thickening
maltiness
which
is
key
for
an
oatmeal
stout
to
keep
in
in
balance
drinks
pretty
well
alcohol
is
almost
non
existent
balance
is
well
done
but
a
heavier
body
would
accentuate
the
maltiness
better
drinkable
but
not
highly
so
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
an
extremely
complex
beer
there
is
an
oat
creamy
soft
character
to
the
beer
but
while
the
flavors
are
not
bad
there
is
a
thin
character
flavors
are
assertive
but
taste
watered
down
a
bit
again
not
terrible
just
really
tastes
a
bit
like
carbonated
black
coffee
poured
near
jet
black
except
for
some
ruby
highlights
when
held
in
the
lighta
creamy
toasted
almond

atop

in

along
with

chocolate
shows
thru
just
a
little
roasty
and
raw
on
the
palatevery
dry
with

i
like

good

ive
had
a
few
ninkasis
i
loved
maiden
the
shade
sweet
artwork
as
well
and
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
them
this
oatmeal
stout
when
poured
was
thick
and
the
color
was
very
dark
brown
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
had
a
pleasant
aroma
now
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
complex
i
could
taste
dark
roasted
malts
cocoa
smoked
coffee
beans
that
finish
with
a
semisweettart
and
bitter
feel
on
the
palate
very
pleasant
oatmeal
stout
not
overlly
bitter
like
alot
of
stouts
d
mouthfeel
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
for
being
fairly
high
abv
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
stout
solid
taste
and
easy
drinking
the
only
slight
letdown
is
the
body
a
little
creaminess
or
softness
is
what
i
expect
in
an
oatmeal
stout
and
it
was
not
there
very
solid
overall
its
not
really
incredibly
exceptional
in
any
particular
way
but
its
executed
well
in
every
area
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
indeed
its
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
ive

up
the
dark
malt
for
a
complimentary
boost
with
what
i
am
tasting
the
texture
is
right
on
although
i
am
in
favor
of
fuller
body
stouts
any
thicker
and
it
would
probably
be
too
sweet
the
over
all
experience
aint
too
bad
definitely
better
than
anderson
valleys
this
may
not
be
the
best
but
definitely
good
to
have
around
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
in
some
ways
but
a
nice
flavor
profile
rather
sessionable
despite
the
abv
would
love
to
try
the
vanilla
version
of
this
o
flavors
are
good
enough
and
the
price
is
right
solid
buy
but
probably
no
more
than
one
a
day
dthis
is
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
not
quite
on
par
with
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
ninkasi
good
value
at
3
99
a
bomber
compared
to
other
breweries
drinkability
is
also
great
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
oatmeal
stout
well
done
ninkasi
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
damn
solid
stout
the
hops
seem
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
especially
in
the
aroma
but
the
malt
characteristics
are
basically
spoton
for
the
style
additionally
this
thing
drinks
like
a
5
beer
not
like
the
7
5
at
which
its
listed
id
gladly
quaff
this
again
indeed
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
d
yes
for
sure
but
not
every
day
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
a
smooth
typical
oatmeal
stout
that
drinks
fast
and
is
nicely
refreshing
recommended
as
a
good
cheap
stout
to
pair
with
food
the
taste
is
similar
with
very
strong
sweet
roastiness
of
heavily
toasted
brown
bread
and
caramelised
barley
singedcaramelised
prunes
a
definite
oatmeal
character
lightly
noticeable
it
has
strong
sweetness
throughout
but
also
a
strong
burntwoody
bitterness
that
just
barely
takes
over
at
the
finish
however
it
lacks
depth
and
complexity
and
alcoholic
strength
is
rather
noticeable
this
combined
with
the
heaviness
of
the
traits
noted
above
brings
down
the
drinkability
d
smells
and
color
great
but
sadly
a
bit
overly
bitter
and
underflavored
poured
a
thick
brownblack
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
finger
of
quickreceding
coffeecolored
head
strong
toasty
aroma
of
chocolate
coffee
and
oats
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
lots
of
oats
up
front
followed
by
coffee
and
a
lingering
milk
chocolate
finish
with
hints
of
hoppy
bitterness
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
the
lightness
achieved
is
impressive
given
the
style
and
relatively
high
abv
d
this
beer
actually
lives
up
to
its
name
with
great
oatmeal
flavors
and
nice
chocolate
presence
that
really
goes
down
nice
and
creamy
hopefully
i
can
get
more
of
this
stuff
dark
brown
opaque

pretty
sweet
but
not
much

very
smooth
full
mouthfeel
above
average
effervescence
not
sticky
despite
sweetness
dangerously
drinkable
not
sure
i
pick
up
the
oats
but
this
is
one
very
smooth
beer
drinkability
really
good
stout
perfect
for
an
overcast
day
which
was
when
i
was
drinking
it
very
nice
all
told
id
give
the
beer
a
b
that
is
to
say
the
flavor
is
pleasant
though
not
pleasant
enough
to
make
me
want
to
buy
another
one
d
a
22ozer
went
down
easy
enought
no
alcohol
presence
a
good
beer
but
not
great
and
not
one
to
rush
back
to
for
me
good
value
but
needs
more
oat
presence
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
rich
robust
and
deep
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
lots
of
flavor
character
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
doesnt
get
real
sweet
just
the
roasted
big
malt
flavours
almost
like
an
irish
dry
a
nice
introduction
to
the
newly
in
ca
ninkasi
lets
see
what
their
other
beers
have
to
offer
pours
a
thick
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
behind
a
bubbly
lilly
pad
on
top
and
rim
deep
toasted
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
are
present
sharp
coffee
note
at
first
which
staggers
into
a
roasted
malt
after
taste
mixed
with
a
bitter
and
astringent
flavor
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
that
does
not
fill
you
up
i
could
drink
many
many
of
these
here
beers
too
bad
i
only
have
the
one
from
a
22
oz
bottle
purchased
locally
aroma
is
roasty
with
a
coffee
note
no
noticeable
hops
jet
black
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
ring
of
tight
bubbles
around
the
top
of
the
glass
flavor
is
assertive
in
the
roast
with
a
large
bittersweet
chocolate
note
in
the
finish
just
enough
sweetness
to
round
out
the
roast
some
hop
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
some
biscuit
notes
once
it
warms
up
thick
mouthfeel
very
chewy
and
a
little
slick
from
the
oats
a
good
stout
balanced
to
the
roasty
side
but
improves
as
it
warms
up
like
liquid
bittersweet
chocolate
drinkability
loved
it
this
is
the
quintessential
oat
stout
bold
flavorful
full
and
addictive
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
bottle
home
the
mouthfeel
works
against
this
otherwise
great
beer
its
just
a
tad
too
thin
to
support
the
roasty
coffee
bean
fruitiness
of
the
malt
i
think
more
chocolate
flavor
would
come
out
if
the
beer
had
a
creamier
feel
theres
cocoa
roast
raisinsweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
though
less
than
expected
the
beer
is
somewhat
acidic
and
of
moderate
sweetness
its
an
excellent
value
better
than
many
similar
stouts
thanks
for
starting
distribution
here
ninkasi
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
a
pretty
looking
khaki
one
finger
head
there
is
minimal
carbonation
activity
after
the
pour
i
am
picking
up
smell
notes
of
the
oatmeal
backed
with
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
smell
characteristics
of
the
beer
it
finishes
very
smooth
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
tasting
beer
with
a
good
look
and
smell
i
recieved
this
beer
from
madhombrewer
as
an
unexpected
thank
you
package
a
nice
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
have
tried
but
i
would
like
to
see
what
else
is
out
in
the
portland
scene
when
it
comes
to
stouts
overall
an
allaround
solid
beer
ill
have
to
seek
out
some
other
stuff
from
ninkasi
d
impressive
oatmeal
stout
just
missing
a
touch
more
body
to
take
it
to
the
top
still
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
robust
and
complex
treating
me
quite
well
after
a
couple
hours
of
snow
shoveling
appearance
is
a
dark
rich
brown
with
a
nice
pillowy
light
brown
head
that
sticks
around
awhile
leaving
nice
lace
smell
owns
a
slightly
sweet
dark
roasted
coffee
aroma
taste
has
the
roasted
malts
coffee
and
more
bitter
than
sweet
chocolate
could
use
a
little
more
malt
to
balance
the
hop
mouthfeel
is
a
good
hearty
solid
stout
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
rich
stout
with
full
flavors
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
i
am
impressed
it
is
disappointingly
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
and
here
coffee
takes
center
stage
and
soon
left
and
right
stage
virtually
pushing
any
other
contenders
out
unidimensional
and
not
that
pleasant
other
comments
a
really
tasty
oat
soda
wellbalanced
and
moreish
doesnt
stand
out
much
from
other
oatmeal
stouts
but
it
doesnt
disappoint
either
a
solid
and
drinkable
beer
that
lacks
the
smoother
thicker
mouthfeel
found
in
most
other
oatmeal
stouts
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darned
tasty
brew
i
like
the
nice
malty
chocolatyness
a
lot
but
i
really
wish
the
oatmeal
lived
up
to
the
name
the
carbonation
is
too
intense
to
fully
get
the
oatmeal
goodness
all
in
all
though
tasty
beer
thanks
jason
one
of
the
finer
oat
meal
stouts
ive
had
all
flavor
nodes
well
balanced
and
an
extremely
drinkable
mix
bought
a
bottle
of
this
the
very
next
day
to
add
to
my
collection
ninkasi
is
one
of
those
breweries
to
keep
your
eye
on
have
some
great
beers
out
right
now
overall
good
stout
wasnt
picking
up
on
oatmeal
but
a
delicious
stout
none
the
less
awesome
overall
a
very
fine
oatmeal
stout
and
one
i
will
surely
be
purchasing
again
soon
nice
and
drinkable
yet
packed
with
flavor
and
substance
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
i
would
dare
say
is
my
favorite
so
far
from
ninkasi
although
the
only
others
ive
had
are
the
ipa
and
dipa
haha
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
a
stout
all
of
this
combines
for
a
good
easy
to
drink
stout
this
is
a
nice
stout
with
lots
of
substance
and
serious
drinkability
its
definitely
not
just
for
breakfast
d
damn
drinkable
really
is
a
drinkable
tasty
stout
pours
a
smooth
opaque
black
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
leaves
a
heavy
ring
around
the
glass
as
well
as
thick
lacing
down
the
glass
as
this
beer
is
drank
the
nose
is
chocolate
and
espresso
dominated
but
has
some
vanilla
and
some
roasted
aromas
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
sweet
chocolate
toffee
and
vanilla
that
finishes
bitter
and
dry
its
a
full
bodied
beer
that
is
velvety
smooth
this
stout
is
an
easy
drinker
and
has
some
nice
subtle
complexities
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottles
and
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
that
much
of
a
difference
its
definitely
a
wintertime
type
of
beer
just
because
its
pretty
heavy
poured
out
its
thick
and
black
with
a
satisfying
brown
head
the
smell
is
fantastic
mainly
of
coffee
but
also
some
chocolate
malts
and
the
oats
themselves
tasty
tasty
lots
of
oaky
oatmeal
flavor
not
a
kbs
but
pretty
close
its
a
heavy
beer
unless
you
havent
eaten
for
a
while
you
might
only
want
one
of
these
good
stuff
as
always
from
ninkasi
super
drinkable
and
not
too
creamy
think
slightly
warm
but
no
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
a
great
sessionable
stout
oatmeal
stouts
should
be
thick
and
strong
not
easy
drinking
for
an
easy
drinking
stout
try
the
dry
irish
versions
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
not
worth
seeking
out
d
a
very
straightforward
oatmeal
stout
i
liked
it
but
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
ninkasi
comes
through
yet
again
oatis
is
good
beer
that
is
a
barley
boost
away
from
being
great
beer
i
could
definitely
waste
some
time
sitting
on
the
dock
of
the
bay
if
i
had
a
few
bombers
of
this
tasty
oatmeal
stout
to
keep
me
company
ninkasi
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
discover
after
moving
to
oregon
ive
had
oatis
on
several
occassions
and
wish
i
had
taken
notes
on
the
vanilla
oatis
that
i
had
a
while
back
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
that
was
perfect
on
a
dark
and
windy
day
here
in
the
land
of
hops
drinkability
light
and
dry
especially
for
a
7
5
abv
if
oatmeal
stout
is
your
brew
you
could
do
this
brew
all
night
but
youd
probably
get
as
roasted
as
the
barley
drinkability
is
good
this
one
is
super
smooth
and
balancedwith
the
alcohol
dangerously
hidden
still
its
always
been
much
more
enjoyable
on
draught
then
this
bottle
which
i
admit
is
probably
a
few
months
old
and
has
been
stored
at
room
temp
at
least
in
the
dark
for
about
half
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
if
you
see
it
buy
some
and
enjoy
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
beers
from
ninkasi
overall
not
a
session
oatmeal
stout
very
strong
alcohol
at
7
5
very
balanced
for
a
strong
stout
smooth
non
tannic
finish
for
amount
of
dark
grains
going
into
this
brew
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
tried
thus
far
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
color
with
a
small
fizzy
brown
head
that
leaves
some
sticking
sweet
roasted
caramel
malt
nose
slightly
smokey
with
some
hints
at
chocolate
and
subtle
fruity
hops
sweet
malts
upfront
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
dry
and
bitter
finish
followed
by
a
long
smokey
chocolate
malt
aftertaste
i
wish
the
flavor
didnt
drop
off
so
quickly
at
just
about
midpalate
add
another
notch
or
2
to
the
body
and
heres
an
absolute
winner
all
in
all
a
solid
straightforward
brew
balanced
almost
subtle
flavors
should
make
this
beer
pair
with
a
wider
range
of
food
than
many
other
stouts
in
my
opinion
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
price
as
reflected
in
my
drinkability
score
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
is
my
benchmark
for
the
style
and
i
could
have
bought
almost
two
for
the
price
of
one
bomber
of
this
a
grower
basically
give
this
one
time
and
warmingits
charms
are
not
immediately
apparent
so
many
of
us
myself
included
want
knockyouoverthehead
and
sendyouunderthetable
action
from
our
stoutsyou
know
those
enormous
monstersbut
this
isnt
trying
to
be
that
at
all
its
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
stout
fixations
and
a
quality
brew
by
any
standard
sent
by
the
evergracious
msubulldog25
my
oregon
connection
keep
em
comin
dog25
d
this
is
a
really
good
oatmeal
stout
i
really
want
to
try
more
stuff
from
ninkasi
poured
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
good
size
tan
head
that
faded
fairly
fast
great
lacing
the
side
of
my
pint
glass
was
covered
smells
of
chocolate
oats
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
in
there
tasted
great
chocolate
oats
nutty
flavor
coffee
this
is
a
thick
and
creamy
beer
first
i
have
had
from
ninkasi
and
i
hope
i
can
get
a
hold
of
this
again
overall
this
is
a
quality
oatmeal
stout
definitely
a
good
beer
to
keep
around
at
all
times
especially
on
a
lazy
sunday
taste
is
smooth
of
milk
chocolate
coffee
roasted
nuts
vanilla
a
touch
of
sour
malt
ends
slightly
dry
and
a
little
bitter
d
get
and
try
it
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
in
a
while
a
valiant
and
bold
brew
do
i
dare
say
that
a
little
more
malt
backbone
would
help
things
out
a
little
maybe
i
am
just
being
picky
good
stuff
received
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
from
a
generous
ba
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
very
small
brown
head
no
retention
and
some
lacing
smells
like
coffee
and
oatmeal
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
of
bittersweet
chocolate
black
coffee
cocoa
beans
brown
sugar
and
oatmeal
alcohol
is
hidden
within
the
rich
and
complex
flavors
full
bodied
and
carbonation
is
low
im
happy
to
see
another
bottle
offering
from
ninkasi
and
this
one
is
well
done

the
aroma
was
great
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
really
smooth
and
full
of
malty
goodness
it
had
a
tiny
hop
presence
on
the
finish
which
rounded
it
out
nicely
in
the
mouth
it
was
creamy
and
lathering
over
the
palate
having
an
oatmeal
stout
like
this
one
makes
me
remember
why
it
is
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
styles
this
was
an
excellent
brew
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
one
again
drinkability
is
really
high
on
this
one
and
when
the
bottle
was
empty
i
was
disappointed
the
abv
doesnt
seem
all
that
apparent
to
me
and
the
flavors
were
impressive
i
feel
that
the
mouthfeel
suffers
a
bit
out
of
the
bottle
as
can
be
expected
however
one
of
the
highlights
of
oatis
on
tap
is
the
impressiveness
of
the
mouthfeel
which
doesnt
quite
come
across
as
well
out
of
a
bomber
still
an
impressive
brew
with
some
incredible
flavors
definitely
worth
a
shot
taste
is
mocha
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
the
cocoa
and
coffee
are
very
well
balanced
the
oats
give
the
beer
good
body
and
make
it
very
smooth
drinkability
is
good
if
you
dont
mind
the
7
2
abv
very
nice
seasonal
overall
a
drinkable
os
good
but
really
could
have
been
a
great
one
if
the
mouthfeel
had
been
thicker
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
but
one
to
try
again
on
a
cool
eve
stout
fans
should
definitely
give
it
a
shot
everything
else
was
fullon
bold
uncompromised
and
entrancing
drinkability
well
the
keg
was
gone
by
the
end
of
the
night
what
more
can
i
say
d
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
ill
be
happy
if
this
is
available
yearround
excellent
balance
and
pairing
with
lunch
and
certainly
one
id
have
again
i
hope
that
its
brewed
often
body
may
be
on
the
light
side
and
the
expected
smoothness
and
creamy
texture
is
present
yet
uneven
no
real
matter
the
flavors
manage
to
carry
all
the
weight
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
dry
and
roasty
a
little
earthy
and
astringent
some
mouthfeel
issues
notwithstanding
this
is
a
tasty
stout
well
worth
sampling
great
ester
presence
and
the
roasted
elements
are
balanced
out
nicely
by
some
sweet
special
effects
down
with
disease
overall
a
good
stout
the
vanilla
is
not
over
done
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
ninkasi
feel
surpringly
dry
and
hot
finish
seems
off
for
what
they
were
going
for
oats
do
little
to
impact
the
feel
thin
body
2
75
oats
and
vanilla
are
very
subtle
mostly
roasted
malt
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
little
sweetness
very
nice
but
not
what
i
expected
from
reading
the
label
can
this
be
used
as
a
meal
replacement
maybe
not
but
it
sure
would
be
fun
to
use
sweet
malty
smooth
pours
with
a
nice
even
head
vanilla
come
through
immediately
finishes
chocolatey
light
roast
has
that
great
oatmeal
bite
but
theres
just
nothing
that
stands
out
very
very
dark
fantastic
looking
beer
light
roasted
malt
smell
overpowered
by
a
nice
sweetness
roasty
sweet
flavor
with
a
vanilla
finish
silky
creamy
thick
decadent
texture
this
is
a
bad
ass
oat
stout
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
nicely
enhanced
by
a
slight
touch
of
vanilla
too
much
vanilla
in
a
beer
is
not
a
good
thing
for
my
palate
definitely
one
i
would
have
again
overall
i
think
the
vanilla
is
just
a
little
too
much
on
this
one
mostly
a
good
beer
but
it
could
be
dialed
back
a
notch
overall
a
delicious
stout
for
someone
who
likes
bitter
beer
high
c
on
tap
roof
of
wholefoods
brooklyn
i
am
tasting
the
vanilla
right
away
with
this
one
after
that
is
a
very
good
sweetish
stout
has
some
body
nice
and
chewy
so
not
a
porter
a
tasty
stout
both
experience
enhancers
oats
for
body
vanilla
for
flavour
workin
it
overtime
it
is
a
tad
strange
the
vanilla
not
being
associated
with
its
usual
barrel
friends
but
thats
ok
with
me
what
we
get
here
is
more
of
the
real
deal
for
what
its
worth
worthy
of
checking
out
if
you
like
the
wellmade
adulterated
much
love
american
stouts
this
is
tasty
but
i
wish
the
vanilla
was
more
pronounced
and
the
finish
was
a
bit
more
complex
couldnt
find
the
vanilla
in
this
one
tasted
of
burnt
toast
through
out
sadly
disappointing
for
my
500th
post
on
ba
pours
a
very
nice
thick
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
fizzy
tan
color
a
small
island
and
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
nice
malty
with
some
nice
vanilla
notes
toffee
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
nice
malty
very
nice
vanilla
note
with
some
toffee
and
chocolate
thrown
in
medium
body
nice
little
chewiness
with
a
slightly
bitterdry
finish
overall
a
nice
brew
glad
to
see
it
here
in
ut
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
worth
a
look
overall
vanilla
keeps
it
interesting
and
elevates
it
o
this
has
a
nice
balance
so
it
doesnt
end
up
being
too
sweet
the
vanilla
takes
the
edge
off
of
the
roasty
malt
this
was
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
a
real
solid
oatmeal
stout
for
sure
missing
some
of
the
vanilla
flavor
it
hints
at
and
a
bit
of
hop
unexpectedness
but
as
an
oatmeal
stout
it
sure
delivers
moderate
pour
from
bomber
into
pint
shaker
glass
produced
a
2
finger
mocha
brown
head
aroma
was
very
good
probably
the
best
attribute
consisting
of
chocolate
malt
and
vanilla
beans
first
impression
upon
putting
to
lips
was
an
astringent
harshness
first
thought
this
was
due
to
over
carbonation
but
the
final
pour
was
a
bit
thin
and
flat
taste
by
itself
was
good
and
improved
as
it
warmed
but
overall
not
well
enough
balanced
especially
in
the
lacking
mouth
feel
to
be
top
of
its
class
wifes
review
i
like
it
it
reminds
me
of
the
vanilla
iced
coffee
at
starbucks
this
is
a
good
old
regular
oatmeal
stout
this
is
good
but
i
would
have
to
be
hard
pressed
to
have
this
again
o
needs
less
bittering
hops
the
bitterness
makes
it
harsh
and
almost
undrinkable
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
m
creamy
medium
bodied
smooth
and
a
touch
dry
thanks
mabermud
for
the
opportunity
over
all
with
the
name
of
the
beer
i
expected
more
this
is
a
beer
you
buy
hoping
for
something
different
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
what
i
expected
overall
a
rather
tasty
brew
if
only
it
had
a
bit
more
smooth
oatmeal
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
taste
and
a
slightly
modified
body
then
it
would
be
one
fantastic
vanilla
oatmeal
stout
even
so
it
is
rather
nice
and
one
to
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
this
beer
pours
well
with
a
deep
jet
black
color
i
could
definitely
taste
the
harmonious
blend
of
vanilla
and
oatmeal
that
elevated
your
typical
stout
flavor
to
a
new
level
i
picked
up
more
vanilla
than
oatmeal
though
neither
was
overpowering
overall
the
taste
was
incredibly
smooth
as
was
the
aftertaste
which
dropped
off
appropriately
gradually
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
didnt
taste
alcoholic
to
me
at
all
despite
the
7
2
abv
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
beer
more
if
it
had
leaned
a
bit
more
overpowering
either
in
raw
flavor
or
in
heaviness
but
as
it
stands
it
felt
smooth
light
and
balanced
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
carbonation
was
weak
which
contributed
to
an
average
mouthfeel
in
an
otherwise
very
nice
beer
would
definitely
drink
again
and
would
probably
have
more
than
one
at
once
impressive
for
a
number
of
reasons
i
love
the
dark
sleek
look
not
shiny
or
flat
but
somewhere
in
between
in
terms
of
luster
smallish
head
but
good
retention
and
white
lacing
i
smell
vanilla
but
its
still
behind
the
dark
earthen
barley
roast
and
a
touch
of
carbon
ash
as
well
minimal
sweetness
in
the
taste
or
the
feel
which
makes
this
for
me
so
many
of
these
come
across
as
sugar
bombs
and
this
one
is
appreciably
dry
as
well
as
bitter
on
the
finish
vanilla
is
also
only
subtle
playing
off
the
body
and
sweetness
of
the
oats
but
contributing
only
accents
most
vanilla
beers
going
right
now
are
so
heavy
in
vanilla
that
the
beer
gets
lost
not
the
case
with
vanilla
oatis
which
stays
dark
and
bitter
and
rich
without
ever
getting
sweet
or
overbearing
well
hidden
alcohol
strength
and
a
long
roasted
barley
finish
fun
and
well
made
beer
among
the
best
ive
had
from
ninkasi
vanilla
stout
kinda
scary
after
my
first
encounter
with
a
vanilla
beer
was
something
from
the
shock
top
line
of
beers
since
then
i
have
had
some
really
good
ones
and
the
vanilla
phobia
is
gone
this
beer
is
not
the
best
on
i
have
has
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
is
a
very
subtle
vanilla
in
every
sense
it
is
barely
noticeable
in
the
nose
and
also
on
the
taste
more
of
the
roast
malt
character
comes
out
in
the
beer
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
oatis
part
of
this
beer
gives
it
a
great
mouth
feel
that
complements
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
someone
who
doesnt
want
some
beer
with
their
vanilla
o
its
a
good
beer
didnt
have
any
expectations
this
is
my
first
oatmeal
stout
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
although
5
for
7abv
is
hard
to
pass
up
would
love
to
have
access
to
this
out
here
in
mn
4
for
22
oz
of
this
stuff
beats
most
anything
comparable
in
this
market
o
damn
good
beer
ill
have
another
please
its
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
eyeing
me
off
so
tonights
its
her
turn
and
pours
a
dark
as
night
black
hue
with
the
creamiest
two
finger
coffee
laced
head
and
some
nice
lacingthe
smell
is
bourbonboozesweet
dark
malts
and
dried
fruitsthe
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
but
feels
light
on
in
body
just
medium
bodied
which
is
a
big
let
down
and
has
tastes
of
strong
vanilla
first
up
followed
by
some
sweet
caramelmilky
chocolate
and
finished
with
a
fruity
hoppiness
which
really
levels
out
the
sweetness
in
a
good
way
but
overall
for
me
im
glad
ive
tried
it
but
its
abit
all
over
the
place
and
not
something
id
seek
out
again
cheers
a
flavorful
potent
breakfast
beer
not
greatly
improved
by
the
vanilla
though
it
works
well
with
the
base
beer
taste
creamy
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
tastes
like
oat
crackers
with
some
very
light
vanilla
butter
on
top
there
is
not
much
vanilla
in
here
o
it
fell
somewhat
short
of
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
its
a
great
stout
the
flavor
of
vanilla
seems
forgotten
at
least
to
me
its
so
common
to
see
it
imitated
in
sweets
as
a
base
flavor
but
real
vanilla
imparts
a
delicious
flavor
that
i
feel
goes
perfectly
with
chocolatey
stouts
and
thats
pretty
much
what
you
get
here
overall
too
much
vanilla
this
one
needs
a
competing
flavor
something
to
go
up
against
the
vanilla
i
was
hoping
for
more
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
with
the
oats
added
it
gives
a
thick
kick
to
it
as
well
as
the
base
malt
which
equals
out
at
7
2
alc
a
very
well
done
stout
ive
had
the
normal
oatis
and
this
vanilla
gives
it
just
a
bit
more
dimension
and
compliments
the
flavors
nicely
pours
a
deep
rich
black
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
coffee
brown
head
the
nose
has
some
faint
chocolate
and
roasty
notes
the
body
is
exactly
the
right
consistency
for
an
oatmeal
stout
which
runs
a
little
thinner
than
others
not
quite
as
creamy
as
other
stouts
you
get
the
coffee
chocolate
notes
from
the
roast
and
i
did
notice
the
vanilla
it
isnt
sweet
or
overpowering
but
id
be
disappointed
without
the
vanilla
well
made
tasty
stout
the
vanilla
does
show
up
but
enough
in
my
liking
as
to
not
take
away
from
the
chocolate
notes
of
the
beer
add
oatmeal
to
the
mix
and
this
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
smooth
in
the
aftertaste
ninkasi
has
become
one
of
my
fave
brewers
from
oregon
available
in
bc
this
stout
hits
the
marks
in
all
areas
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
22
oz
bottle
overall
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
very
solid
brew
up
to
the
taste
they
tried
too
hard
with
the
vanilla
and
could
have
tried
balancing
with
a
bit
of
more
lasting
sweetness
nonetheless
an
enjoyable
stout
another
excellent
beer
from
the
goddess
i
bought
this
bomber
in
livingston
montana
at
the
albertsons
supermarket
which
is
the
only
place
ive
seen
it
thus
far
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
cookie
dough
and
vanilla
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
vanilla
and
lots
of
char
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
a
fairly
acrid
char
flavor
that
lingers
long
after
each
sip
and
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
in
my
opinion
overall
real
easy
drinking
stout
right
here
i
had
it
with
breakfast
and
it
paired
very
well
minor
ding
for
the
carbonic
note
to
it
but
a
masterfully
done
easy
drinking
and
roasty
rocking
beer
i
am
glad
to
finally
taste
another
bit
of
greatness
from
a
criminally
underrated
brewery
another
good
beer
from
ninkasi
smooth
drinker
here
abv
is
well
beyond
sessionable
but
youd
not
know
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
nice
flavor
and
feel
very
drinkable
but
again
lacks
the
taste
of
vanilla
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
that
you
would
think
it
trying
to
highlight
the
use
of
vanilla
in
the
brewing
process
pretty
good
but
not
outstanding
has
a
good
feel
but
lacks
on
the
vanilla
a
bit
of
a
head
would
make
it
more
appealing
to
the
eye
too
appearance
is
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
fairly
stable
head
leaving
fair
lace
smell
of
the
dark
malt
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
the
oatmeal
taste
is
in
par
with
the
aroma
having
a
nice
balance
with
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
a
very
nice
stout
with
a
twist
there
were
hints
of
vanilla
but
overall
it
seemed
a
bit
faded
which
was
somewhat
disappointing
if
i
am
going
to
decide
to
get
the
vanilla
oatis
over
the
regular
version
i
want
there
to
be
a
noticeable
different
the
favor
was
nice
which
i
was
not
surprised
by
as
i
like
the
regular
version
but
i
was
not
wowed
either
by
the
vanilla
or
by
anything
deeper
coming
from
this
beer
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
there
are
just
lots
of
others
that
i
would
choose
before
i
got
to
this
one
not
a
marked
improvement
over
the
original
but
its
solid
the
vanilla
is
nice
and
subtle
adding
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
still
clutch
for
the
style
a
hot
day
but
like
i
said
a
great
winter
warmer
recommended
for
522oz
but
not
for
much
more
than
facevalue
its
worthy
and
drinks
nicely
o
great
mouthfeel
and
pretty
big
vanilla
notes
but
natural
tasting
and
not
too
overwhelming
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
the
original
oatis
just
a
little
bit
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
sweet
stout
will
definitely
get
again
leans
to
the
sweet
side
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
if
you
like
sweeter
stouts
youll
probably
enjoy
this
one
o
oatis
is
decent
more
vanilla
might
have
helped
this
one
but
i
couldnt
find
any
prost
lampertland
pours
a
smooth
mahogany
with
a
coffee
colored
head
thick
lacing
and
nice
creamy
consistency
on
the
head
smells
like
the
regular
oatis
oatmeal
stout
tastes
surprisingly
bitter
but
finishes
with
the
same
oatis
flavors
malted
oats
honey
and
a
bit
of
sweet
coffee
i
was
however
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
vanilla
flavor
within
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
but
the
finish
leaves
very
little
taste
of
any
kind
of
vanilla
overall
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
o
its
an
alright
brew
i
think
i
prefer
the
straight
oatis
near
world
class
overall
i
prefer
the
regular
oatis
but
i
believe
this
would
be
a
promising
crossover
beer
for
newer
stout
drinkers
one
of
the
main
ingredients
in
chocolates
is
vanilla
also
hard
to
believe
this
is
7
2
abv
from
the
taste
well
hidden
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
the
vanilla
use
but
it
was
well
done
became
the
focal
point
complimented
by
the
base
beer
for
3
29
or
whatever
it
was
this
is
a
hit
and
not
a
miss
43

this
one
is
for
after
dinner
and
before
bed
time
would
probably
be
great
for
a
beer
float
if
it
werent
so
great
on
its
own
id
recommended
using
something
less
complex
that
is
not
so
tasty
by
itself
if
you
want
to
float
some
ice
cream
overall
sometimes
less
is
more
such
is
the
case
here
with
vanilla
oatis
the
standard
oatis
is
a
very
very
good
oatmeal
stout
multilayerd
with
lots
of
flavor
adding
vanilla
melds
all
those
flavors
together
making
a
beer
that
at
best
hits
on
two
notes
fair
to
good
beer
overall
but
id
take
the
original
version
everytime
over
this
variation
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
blackishbrown
colour
with
some
nice
tan
head
the
smell
is
big
on
creamy
chocolate
notes
the
taste
is
quite
rich
with
the
vanilla
showing
up
as
a
sort
of
burnt
marshmallow
flavour
theres
a
bit
of
smoke
in
there
as
well
as
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
the
vanilla
component
is
complementary
without
domination
nice
o
a
pleasure
to
drink
looks
smells
taste
very
quality
just
a
tiny
hint
of
the
7
2
i
would
drink
this
regularly
funny
i
like
my
ipas
bitter
but
my
stouts
sweet
good
price
too
beautiful
use
of
vanilla
right
here
its
sultry
and
smooth
sweet
and
savory
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
a
fine
one
finger
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
sweet
aroma
dominated
by
vanilla
with
light
toasted
malt
flavor
is
toasted
malt
coffee
and
quite
distinct
but
well
integrated
vanilla
starts
semisweet
finishes
dry
and
crisp
with
bitter
coffee
and
light
hops
medium
creamy
body
with
nice
mouth
feel
a
nicely
made
oatmeal
stout
with
deft
use
of
vanilla
flavoring
nicely
balanced
ill
watch
for
this
the
next
time
it
arrives
o
oatis
is
good
and
made
better
by
vanilla
but
everyone
know
vanilla
makes
dark
beers
better
overall
try
it
the
body
was
pleasing
solid
but
there
was
a
lingering
stickysweetness
on
the
finish
drinkability
was
good
but
the
sweetness
detracted
from
the
overall
enjoyment
a
very
good
solid
beer
thats
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
o
i
would
happily
have
a
couple
pints
of
this
again
strong
characterful
stuff
that
isnt
oppresssive
and
on
this
account
the
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
helps
the
drinkability
going
in
to
this
looking
for
a
huge
blockbuster
of
a
beer
will
leave
you
disapointed
but
its
a
very
nice
medium
bodied
stout
with
an
excess
of
delicious
character
opass
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
fantastic
vanilla
stout
one
of
my
favorite
regional
stouts
is
really
on
another
plain
with
the
addition
of
the
vanilla
beans
rarely
seen
but
always
ordered
all
things
considered
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
one
that
i
prefer
considerably
to
the
regular
oatis
wish
ninkasi
would
make
this
available
all
the
time
i
tried
this
beer
at
the
ninkasi
tasting
room
i
was
quite
surpised
from
this
beer
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
oatis
and
i
am
now
a
bigger
fan
of
the
vanilla
oatis
poured
via
tap
into
a
pint
glass
by
a
sexy
female
bartender
light
creamy
head
with
sweet
vanilla
aroma
the
beer
not
the
bartender
i
hope
this
comes
out
in
bottles
soon
i
wasnt
able
to
take
the
brewery
tour
due
to
construction
one
must
invent
a
devise
to
hold
the
mouth
open
for
full
time
pour
of
vanilla
oatis
into
my
mouth
huge
fan
this
has
a
nice
dark
pour
with
a
brown
head
to
it
immediately
i
could
pick
up
the
aromas
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
very
strong
tasted
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
finish
was
a
little
on
the
bitter
and
smoky
side
left
my
mouth
feeling
a
little
dry
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
prefer
others
in
the
dark
horse
series
12oz
bottle
poured
into
stout
chalice
black
and
opaque
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
molasses
cocoa
coffee
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
malt
and
chicory
bitterness
medium
body
thin
texture
lively
carbonation
for
a
stout
and
an
astringent
finish
this
is
a
well
made
oatmeal
stout
i
gave
it
decent
numbers
jet
black
nice
aroma
nice
taste
i
think
this
stout
should
get
better
scores
but
everyones
taste
is
different
from
the
first
sniff
it
was
clear
drinking
would
be
a
chore
this
beer
tastes
like
hopsy
cola
almost
a
painful
feel
in
the
mouth
as
someone
once
said
of
a
basswood
telecaster
i
will
repeat
about
a
highly
hoppy
stoutit
aint
right
i
tell
ya
i
will
definitely
try
other
stouts
in
dark
horses
series
but
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
square
one
this
is
a
good
beer
out
of
the
five
seasonal
stouts
by
dark
horse
i
prefer
the
fifth
obviously
and
thres
im
glad
i
tried
this
though
a
good
oatmeal
stout
just
not
a
fan
of
this
one
and
im
a
stout
kinda
guy
o
i
didnt
let
it
sit
long
enough
and
the
coolness
impacted
the
first
impression
as
it
warmed
the
profile
also
expanded
the
roasted
oats
and
trailing
bitterness
softened
though
not
entirely
and
blended
fairly
well
with
the
exception
of
the
head
retention
which
would
have
helped
expand
the
profile
and
the
bitterness
this
held
true
to
the
basic
style
well
done
dark
horse
a
good
oatmeal
stout
with
bitter
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
flavosr
but
lacks
the
sweetness
found
in
founders
breakfast
stout
the
standard
by
which
i
measure
oatmeal
stouts
o
the
smell
was
great
but
the
taste
not
so
much
it
didnt
have
the
sweetness
i
wanted
from
an
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
deep
inky
balck
with
a
dark
brown
and
fizzy
head
no
retention
beyond
a
thin
ring
around
the
circumference
but
it
still
manages
to
leave
a
smudge
of
small
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
deep
malt
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
coffee
the
taste
is
equally
robust
with
more
emphasis
on
the
roasted
malt
the
body
is
a
little
lighter
with
the
addition
of
the
oats
and
has
a
nice
silky
feel
giving
it
a
3
25
just
because
i
keep
trying
to
figure
this
one
out
it
tastes
like
the
marlborough
mans
leather
jacket
with
some
dark
chocolate
dropped
on
it
this
one
needs
some
sweetness
to
make
it
work
i
appreciate
the
smokey
note
but
the
bitterness
is
fighting
it
in
a
bad
way
but
i
keep
drinking
it
not
a
repeat
buy
but
a
happy
try
overall
i
hate
to
be
an
8th
grade
girl
but
meh
very
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
had
an
8oz
draft
nice
full
flavor
would
happily
order
again
decent
oatmeal
stout
overall
i
dinged
it
here
because
it
drinks
a
lot
more
like
a
porter
than
an
oatmeal
stout
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
real
good
overall
a
pretty
simple
stout
from
the
dark
horse
crew
i
would
have
liked
a
fuller
body
and
more
creaminess
from
an
oatmeal
stout
especially
one
clocking
in
at
7
00
regardless
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
and
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
off
the
four
pack
dirty
harsh
not
a
fan
solid
oatmeal
stout
a
bargain
at
8
for
a
4
pack
good
malt
profile
with
a
creamy
mouth
feel
just
as
you
would
expect
only
knock
on
it
is
a
slight
initial
wateriness
of
flavor
it
could
do
with
a
bit
more
roast
to
kick
things
off
roasted
malt
bomb
very
robust
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
i
like
it
7
is
nice
too
not
quite
as
oaty
as
some
but
a
nice
balance
of
roast
and
cocoa
very
drinkable
the
chocolate
and
cherry
meld
well
together
this
beer
is
fantastic
o
not
as
smooth
as
i
expected
for
an
oatmeal
stout
though
that
might
be
due
to
the
higher
abv
than
i
normally
find
in
the
style
there
are
lots
of
complex
malty
flavors
and
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
though
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
bottle
is
undated
probably
2
5
years
old
late
2011
bottlecap

are
in
great

dissipated
quickly
revealing
a

smell

coffee
some
bitterness
or
sourness
pretty
big

even
when
cold
taste
is
tangy
sweet
upfront
reminiscent
of
berries
this
immediately
leads
to
a
strong
roasted

coffee
dark

farther
back
some
sweetness
more
roast
lots
of
roast
finish
is
lots
of
lingering
roast
some

bitterness
too
mouthfeel
is
full
way
thicker
than
i
would
expect
and
decent
carbonation
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
long
time
and
it
exceeded
my
recollections
its
superroasty
which
is
this
beers
calling
card
there
is
sweetness
and
bitterness
too
that
gives
some
complexity
but
nothing
overthetop
i
need
to
buy
more
o
this
is
just
okay
nothing
sticks
out
to
make
it
worth
repeating
i
bought
several
dark
horse
stouts
at
the
same
time
and
so
far
none
of
them
have
been
noteworthy
falls
a
bit
short
compared
to
other
highly
regarded
oatmeal
stouts
probably
wouldnt
get
again
that
being
said
i
still
enjoyed
it
overall
this
one
definitely
grew
on
me
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
subtly
delicious
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
dark
horse
and
a
good
start
to
the
holiday
stout
series
very
robust
and
rich
flavor
that
proves
to
be
one
hell
of
an
oatmeal
stout
o
label
says
oatmeal
but
doesnt
have
the
character
of
an
oatmeal
the
beer
looked
awesome
coming
out
of
the
bottle
but
then
when
you
get
it
into
it
it
is
just
too
robust
with
some
very
bold
aromas
and
flavors
especially
the
tobacco
character
nothing
is
subtle
in
this
brew
something
is
off
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
isnt
really
very
good
either
o
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
bitter
finish
it
had
everything
going
for
it
up
until
then
i
would
likely
be
all
4s
but
the
finish
is
all
you
remember
and
rather
disappointing
ive
had
one
i
have
two
and
will
need
to
get
myself
tres
and
fore
to
try
out
when
i
head
back
to
the
store
this
is
a
very
respectable
oatmeal
stout
its
not
a
fantastic
one
but
a
damn
tasty
beer
that
id
seek
out
again
pours

dark

a
foamy

a

complex
combination
of
flavors
that
includes

and
a
finish
that
is
mildly
bitter
has
a
full
body
feel
delicious

a
quick
to

quick
to

mocha
colored
head
atoparomas
of

stick
out
but
honestly
are
pretty
light
in
my
opinion
low
carbonation
with
a
slick
feel
in
the
mouth
flavors
of
char
and
vanilla
stand
out
most
with
roast
underneatha
bit
of
molasseslike
sweetness
is
there
as
well
i
expected
a
little
more
with
this
beer
but
there
are
many
others
to
seek
out
ahead
of
this
in
my
opinion
not
what
i
would
call
a
great
oatmeal
stout
i
finished
it
but
it
took
awhile
i
went
with
a
heavyhanded
pour
to
keep
things
progressing
this
resulted
in
two
dense
fingers
of
deepbrwon
head
with
excellent
retention
nose
smelled
like
someone
had
melted
a
milk
chocolate
candy
bar
and
poured
it
into
my
glass
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
allowing
zero
light
penetration
srm
44
mouthfeel
was
big
and
chewy
like
a
dollop
of
fudge
atop
my
tongue
phew
the
taste
was
smoky
more
towards
campfire
than
house
fire
with
a
chocolaty
sweetness
that
left
me
wondering
what
had
possessed
me
i
like
hoppy
beers
not
maltdriven
ones
but
even
so
i
will
give
this
a
fair
shake
finish
continued
to
be
fudgy
sweet
and
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
do
not
mind
bitter
stouts
but
sweet
is
never
going
to
make
it
into
my
wheelhouse
overall
a
solid
stout
full
bodied
without
being
anything
over
the
top
or
to
heavy
not
a
ton
of
the
oatmeal
flavors
but
some
smooth
creaminess
is
picked
up
looked
at
this
line
of
dark
horse
stouts
for
a
while
glad
i
finally
tried
this
one
o
not
a
terrible
stout
but
not
a
great
representative
of
an
oatmeal
which
should
have
a
degree
of
smoothness
and
longlasting
head
this
one
lacks
an
underrated
shelf
stout
especially
for
what
it
costs
and
its
availability
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
flavour
profile
and
mouthfeel
even
the
smell
has
some
dark
fruits
to
it
which
i
dont
get
in
a
lot
of
shelf
stouts
im
looking
forward
to
the
two
cream
stout
which
ill
probably
crack
tomorrow

oz

a
pretty
solid
stout
with
good
flavor
and
aroma
its
not
anything
special
but
its
quite
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
certainly
worth
trying
d
this
was
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
with
simple
but
enjoyable
scent
and
taste
and
body
the
finish
was
a
bit
harsh
but
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
nice
to
try
once
at
least
but
nothing
special
overall
i
love
most
dark
horse
brews
and
while
this
isnt
a
favorite
its
not
bad
mediumfull
body
with
a
pleasant
flavor
there
is
some
sweetness
and
roastiness
from
the
malt
and
a
smoothing
grainy
earthy
note
from
the
oats
a
pretty
middleoftheroad
oatmeal
stout
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
dry
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
the
feel
is
smooth
and
silky
but
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
not
much
to
complain
about
with
this
brew
but
not
much
to
write
home
about
either
the
feel
is
really
smooth
with
nice
thickness
low
carbonation
and
a
silky
viscosity
o
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
though
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
subdued
flavors
and
slight
lack
of
body
really
detract
here
hopefully
the
rest
of
the
dh
stout
series
are
better
would
have
again
in
case
my
taste
is
simply
off
tonight
dh
does
know
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
stouts
after
all
overall
a
combination
of
flavors
that
just
doesnt
work
for
me
i
like

dry
with
moderate
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
mild
astringency
from
the
roasted
malts
an
okay
beer
and
it
seem
to
have
improved
based
on
the
alstrom
brothers
review
from
2004
i
probably
might
pick
one
up
the
next
time
its
released
a
mighty
fine
oatmeal
stout
extremely
quaffable
solid
black
pour
with
a
small
tan
head
that
sank
to
a
ringlet
roasty
stout
aroma
dark
malts
toasted
oats
and
barley
no
surprises
this
followed
into
the
taste
roasty
dark
malts
toasted
grains
slight
coffee
bitterness
ash
the
body
was
about
medium
kind
of
weak
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
id
bet
it
would
work
well
on
nitro
a
pretty
basic
but
solid
oatmeal
stout
overall
i
finally
found
an
oatmeal
stout
that
rivals
the
poet
from
new
holland
this
has
an
exceptionally
clean
finish
and
a
great
flavor
unfortunately
i
cant
find
it
close
to
me
but
i
did
find
it
in
traverse
city
mi
and
im
glad
i
did
im
saving
a
couple
bottles
from
my
4
pack
to
let
friends
try
it
i
never
have
a
fridge
without
poet
in
it
but
if
i
am
able
to
find
one
oatmeal
stout
nearby
i
will
make
sure
that
it
fills
any
potential
void
great
flavor
great
mouthfeel
and
overall
a
fantastic
brew
from
dark
horse
this
is
a
nice
offering
the
flavor
has
incredible
depth
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
notes
are
impeccable
but
the
nuances
such
as
the
black
licorice
add
tremendous
character
the
lightening
touch
of
the
oatmeal
thins
the
body
just
enough
to
make
this
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
stout
that
is
worth
trying
one
of
my
fav
beers
to
age
changes
a
little
but
1
122
years
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
usually
try
to
buy
a
case
drink
some
and
then
age
some
good
stuff
thick
black
beer
with
a
onefinger
light
brown
head
that
fades
to
a
respectable
ring
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasty
dark
malts
with
hints
of
marzipan
and
vanilla
sweet
caramelly
maltiness
thats
almost
immediatley
balanced
by
a
bitter
hops
the
finish
is
a
bit
rough
with
the
substantial
hop
bitteness
and
dark
malts
amplifying
an
astringency
8
abv
beer
with
mediumfull
bodied
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
come
of
sticky
or
filmy
o
nothing
amazing
but
its
a
solid
offering
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
mediocre
imperial
stout
and
thats
actually
a
compliment
in
this
case
othe
sweetness
of
an
oatmeal
stout
is
not
present
at
all
a
tad
too
burnt
as
well
o
thought
this
was
a
pretty
decent
decent
beer
to
be
honest
yet
quite
interesting
its
sweet
in
smell
yet
pretty
bold
in
flavor
in
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
for
its
style
sweet
aroma
dominated
by
a
nutty
chocolate
smell
pours
almost
completely
black
with
a
nice
dark
brown
head
has
a
decently
thick
syrupy
texture
creamy
and
softly
carbonated
has
a
pleasant
sweet
burnt
oat
coffee
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
overall
a
good
stout
not
a
big
wow
factor
in
terms
of
taste
but
a
solid
porter
nonetheless
overall
solid
flavorful
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
right
on
for
a
good
oatmeal
stout
really
malty
and
smokey
and
coffee
bitter
worth
a
drink
for
sure
overall
a
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
lots
of
roasty
taste
with
a
nice
creamy
smoothness
its
what
you
expect
for
the
style
o
this
is
one
of
my
top
3
oatmealmilk
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
i
acquired
it
in
a
trade
and
am
going
to
assume
that
dark
horse
went
back
to
the
drawing
board
over
the
past
few
years
and
changed
it
up
its
soooo
smooth
and
the
balance
is
uncanny
i
am
going
to
trade
for
this
again
and
soon
o
overall
pretty
solid
although
a
bit
one
dimensional
id
have
again
very
good
oatmeal
stout
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
price
however
i
can
see
how
some
people
many
not
like
it
the
roasted
malts
used
by
dark
horse
in
their
stout
series
have
a
much
more
dark
black
coffee
taste
overall
nothing
special
but
pretty
good
the
best
aspect
of
this
one
is
how
smooth
it
is
going
down
it
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
despite
having
only
a
slightly
above
average
flavor
profile
the
scent
is
pretty
good
pours
a
black
color
14
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
oatmeal
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
dominated
by
alcohol
in
aroma
and
body
even
though
it
is
only
7
according
the
the
bottle
my
first
sample
of
dark
horse
im
impressed
o
a
very
good
beer
they
hit
on
most
of
the
great
qualities
that
this
style
can
have
o
this
is
a
nice
stout
if
you
like
lots
of
flavors
of
roasted
malts
although
i
didnt
notice
any
smoothness
from
the
oats
in
the
mouthfeel
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
perceptible
in
the
taste
this
is
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
ever
had
the
beer
looked
great
but
lacked
in
aroma
the
taste
more
than
made
it
up
for
it
smoooth
and
if
a
beer
can
be
too
drinkable
this
would
be
it
i
could
have
drank
that
beer
all
night
recommending
this
to
everyone
and
i
hope
i
can
find
it
in
6ers
just
about
black
with
a
milk
chocolate
like
brown
head
good
retention
and
great
lace
nose
has
roast
on
the
front
end
with
some
sweeter
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
in
the
middle
sweeter
chocolate
as
well
roast
oats
upfront
on
the
palate
moderate
chocolate
and
drysthins
out
on
the
back
end
finishing
with
roast
again
body
is
thinner
than
i
appreciate
for
the
style
but
alcohol
is
hidden
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
for
sure
pours
a
deep
black
color
crowned
with
a
fat
cocoa
head
that
fades
to
a
slim
ring
thick
rich
roasted
malt
smooth
chocolate
oats
and
underlying
toffee
loads
of
heavy
chocolaty
malt
over
some
dark
fruit
vanilla
bean
and
coffee
some
char
and
bitterness
add
an
edge
to
an
otherwise
silky
stout
medium
bodied
but
pretty
velvety
and
oily
which
fluffs
it
up
a
bit
very
nice
a
bit
overroasted
perhaps
but
delicious
nevertheless
o
a
well
crafted
oatmeal
stout
that
is
slightly
muddled
and
off
in
the
finish
for
the
style
i
get
the
oats
but
its
finish
is
not
quit
what
i
look
for
in
a
oatmeal
stout
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
one
i
will
not
be
in
a
rush
to
go
back
and
get
still
enjoyed
it
though
cheers
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
thick
dark
color
with
light
tan
head
smells
are
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
molasses
and
cocoa
taste
is
heavy
on
dark
cocoa
oatmeal
marshmallow
and
roasted
malt
with
some
smokiness
alcohol
is
somewhat
prevalent
this
is
a
decent
tasty
stout
where
the
beer
far
exceeds
any
expectation
of
oatmeal
stout
its
largerthanlife
character
causes
the
beer
to
register
with
the
palate
and
tongue
as
an
imperial
stout
though
the
beer
refuses
to
take
sides
it
captures
the
essence
of
both
masterfully
overall
just
a
touch
more
malt
sweetness
would
have
improved
this
one
just
a
bit
but
overall
i
enjoyed
it
not
sure
i
need
to
have
another
in
the
future
but
i
wouldnt
say
no
if
offered
overall
nice
big
oatmeal
stout
i
enjoyed
it
looks
alright
could
use
a
bit
more
head
nose
is
okay
as
well
lots
of
molasses
flavor
is
thick
mostly
in
body
though
the
flavor
character
is
constant
and
robust
with
a
thick
kinda
thing
going
on
but
there
is
nothing
that
really
strikes
me
as
unique
or
interesting
or
nothing
that
strikes
me
as
an
oatmeal
stout
to
be
honest
oh
well
its
still
a
nice
beer
o
a
pretty
standard
stout
but
the
taste
really
stands
out
as
everything
comes
together
tastesmokycharred
meat
dark
roasted
coffee
burnt
hops
a
definite
sipper
with
big
bold
flavors
not
smooth
like
a
traditional
oatmeal
stout
strong
tastebuds
needed
o
a
super
burnt
oatmeal
stout
loads
of
char
and
smoke
everywhere
makes
it
quite
bitter
despite
oatmeals
usual
smoothing
effect
better
once
it
warms
flavors
meld
a
bit
better
this
has
more
dark
chocolate
flavor
that
any
beer
ive
had
in
recent
memory
this
is
interesting
but
i
must
note
that
this
beer
is
lacking
some
of
the
attributes
i
look
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
like
wheres
my
chewy
mouthfeel
regardless
its
worth
a
try
o
recommended
to
round
out
the
dark
horse
stout
trio
i
like
them
all
but
i
enjoyed
three
the
best
with
the
blueberry
addition
this
has
a
dry
roasty
finish
as
an
oatmeal
stout
should
have
just
not
my
favorite
stout
style
eh
this
was
just
ok
and
i
find
the
other
stouts
from
dh
much
more
appealing
feels
slightly
creamy
but
overall
leaves
a
nice
roasty
presence
late
reminiscent
of
dark
roasted
coffee
best
oatmeal
stout
that
ive
had
overall
i
was
very
exited
by
how
it
looked
and
smelled
but
it
didnt
come
through
where
it
counted
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
too
spectacular
either
overall
i
appreciate
the
multitude
and
subtlety
of
the
flavors
but
the
roast
is
overdone
i
also
would
prefer
it
if
the
nose
was
stronger
in
conveying
all
the
subtleties
and
the
mouth
feel
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
thicker
otherwise
this
stout
is
good
and
is
one
i
would
have
again
o
bravo
encore
i
love
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
style
near
perfection
a
little
overthetop
with
the
roasted
malts
but
thats
right
up
my
alley
i
really
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
just
a
single
bottle
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lace
nose
is
roast
chocolate
maybe
some
dark
fruit
and
oatmeal
i
usually
dont
actually
detect
oatmeal
in
oatmeal
stouts
but
here
i
do
for
sure
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
all
of
the
above
but
just
lacks
something
for
me
maybe
has
too
much
of
something
alcohol
presence
and
oat
body
is
full
a
bit
of
bitter
from
the
roasty
malt
warm
booze
finish
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
i
think
a
bit
too
big
for
my
liking
and
needing
some
fine
tuning
to
be
very
good
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
relatively
sweet
not
cloying
though
nice
finish
mildly
bitter
with
the
roast
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
a
repeat
o
a
decent
effort
from
dark
horse
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
body
and
some
more
pronounced
coffee
notes
its
an
oatmeal
stout
so
perhaps
some
more
evidence
of
that
is
in
order
too
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
brought
down
by
the
lack
of
balance
in
the
taste
the
heavy
bitter
overroasted
malt
flavor
isnt
something
i
like
and
it
really
drags
down
what
would
otherwise
be
a
very
impressive
beer
overall
another
nice
compliment
to
the
oatmeal
stout
style
will
be
enjoying
more
of
these
in
the
future
and
hopefully
on
draft
too
one
of
the
darkest
beers
i
have
ever
poured
deep
black
but
thats
where
the
excitement
ends
for
me
i
hardly
get
any
smell
even
after
burying
my
nose
in
the
tulip
glass
the
taste
is
quite
mundane
there
is
a
rather
nondescript
roasted
flavor
and
slight
hop
bitterness
but
thats
it
thanks
redliner8
im
a
big
fan
of
dark
horse
stouts
and
the
first
in
the
series
one
is
a
hit
id
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
not
really
remarkable
but
solid
i
enjoy
really
roasty
stouts
like
this
but
there
isnt
much
that
distinguishes
it
from
others
in
the
same
category
that
said
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
smokey
or
roasted
and
not
sweet
enough
for
the
style
but
i
did
enjoy
this
pick
one
up
if
given
the
chance
thanks
to
mcnuts
for
this
extra

of

very
solid

i
was
a

underwhelmed

the
mouthfeel

drinkability
body
is
much
thinner

i
expected

i
guess
the

stronger

brings
down
the

bad
i
really
thought
this
beer
was
going
somewhere
special
until
the
mouthfeel
still
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
in
my
opinion
but
i
do
feel
spoiled
when
it
comes
to
oatmeal
stouts
having
ipswich
almost
always
fresh
and
ready
to
be
consumed
glad
to
have
finally
given
it
a
try
though
ill
certainly
be
going
back
for
more
o
i
like
the
beer
but
i
would
have
a
hard
time
picking
it
as
an
oatmeal
stout
if
i
hadnt
seen
the
label
if
you
like
big
stouts
that
arent
quite
imperial
this
would
definitely
be
a
beer
to
try

more
overall
this
is
a
realy

are
pretty

would
like
a

the

nearly
make
up
for
this

this

warm

dont

excellent

folks
the

i
like

it
certainly
stands
tall
amongst
the
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
odnot
bad
tried
a
single
for
close
to
3
so
i
wouldnt
call
this
much
of
a
bargain
although
singles
rarely
are
pretty
solid
but
not
spectacular
in
any
one
area
worth
a
try
but
i
have
had
a
few
of
dark
horses
other
stouts
that
i
enjoyed
more
than
this
o
this
stout
is
a
bit
disappointing
the
smell
is
there
but
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be

a
toasty
almost
charred
balancing
taste
coffee
grounds
make
an
appearance
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
in
the
background
the
flavors
blend
together
well
but
are
a
bit
abrasive
overall
good
smooth
body
despite
the
bitter
characteristics
with
a
good
lacing
left
along
the
glass
the
aftertaste
is
a
mix
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
day
old
coffee
with
a
bitter
twinge
left
on
the
tongue
and
in
mouth
the
finish
lingers
on
quite
a
bit
although
not
entirely
unpleasant
there
is
a
slight
drying
in
mouth
that
begs
for
another
drink
flavor
profiles
and
mouthfeel
lean
me
more
towards
an
irish
dry
stout
versus
oatmeal
but
a
decent
brew
regardless
oa
decent
if
not
spectacular
stout
o
a
very
yummy
beer
for
anyone
that
likes
a
nice
smooth
drink
loaded
with
bitter
chocolate
flavor
overall
not
bad
but
definitely
packs
a
more
robust
malt
profile
than
expected
smooth
and
easy
drinking
but
the
weird
corncardboard
flavor
gets
distracting
d
wow
i
dont
know
how
this
has
such
low
ratings
this
seems
like
it
should
be
an
a
in
my
book
a
heavy
truthful
chocolatey
stout
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
founders
breakfast
is
the
only
one
in
this
vein
that
ive
tried
that
does
what
this
beer
is
attempting
any
better
this
is
a
great
beer
will
be
getting
this
again
excellence
and
not
holding
this
against
the
beer
but
one
ugly
and
seemingly
meaningless
label
overall
its
enjoyable
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
for
a
while
nothing
truly
stands
out
regarding
this
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
terrible
either
o
i
think
is
a
good
beer
it
smells
fantastic
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
leave
something
to
be
desired
its
not
terrible
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
returning
to
this
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
an
oatmeal
stout
o
i
found
this
to
be
quite
pleasant
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
didnt
detect
any
oatmeal
in
the
smell
but
found
it
more
in
the
taste
i
would
have
it
again
side
note
my
bottle
has
the
same
configuration
as
the
bottle
pictured
here
but
does
have
some
additional
graphics
added
to
the
label
there
is
a
star
behind
the
dark
horse
insignia
updated
version
a
good
beer
but
perhaps
one
dimensional
in
taste
found
some
notation
on
a
page
reminding
me
of
this
beer
at
a
tasting
a
little
while
ago
it
pays
to
keep
notes
this
stuff
pours
a
straight
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
toasted
oats
light
coffee
and
light
chocolate
powder
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
raising
a
bit
of
bitterness
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
generally
smooth
feel
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
if
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
good
times
overall
not
really
that
exciting
kind
of
a
one
dimensional
roast
burnt
stout
with
not
much
depth
to
it
very
wet
too
i
would
probably
pass
it
up
the
brewery
has
certainly
made
better
big
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
more
specifically
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
dark
roasted
coffee
notes
possibly
espresso
there
is
also
a
sugary
sweetness
to
the
sip
the
finish
features
a
hoppy
snap
bite
but
rather
subtle
overall
o
a
decent
overall
oatmeal
stout
was
suprised
by
the
amount
of
leather
and
tobacco
present
would
like
to
try
this
on
cask
o
all
the
backbones
are
there
just
the
taste
is
a
little
off
i
really
like
this
series
from
dark
horse
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
aasher
for
this
one
first
in
the
series
and
first
on
the
day
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
pitch
black
with
a
minimal
brown
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
cream
and
subtle
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cream
caramel
dark
chocolate
subtle
roasted
malt
and
oatmeal
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
really
quite
nice
and
interesting
i
really
like
how
it
incorporated
a
character
of
dark
chocolate
and
cream
in
this
one
to
help
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
was
probably
the
best
part
of
this
one
in
my
opinion
though
it
reminded
me
of
a
really
nice
ris
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
tasty
oatmeal
stout
that
is
another
good
offering
from
dark
horse
maybe
a
smoother
and
thicker
mouthfeel
would
amp
it
up
a
bit
i
had
this
ale
on
three
separate
occasions
because
i
was
convinced
i
just
was
not
getting
it
you
know
missing
something
also
at
different
temps
ranging
from
cold
from
the
tap
to
room
temp
that
being
said
if
its
here
i
cant
find
it
a
good
experience
none
the
less
this
is
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
ale
alcohol
is
not
detectable
very
good
aftertaste
which
makes
the
mouthfeel
extra
fine
great
beer
nice
mouthfeel
that
youd
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
not
quite
the
silkiness
id
hope
for
maybe
a
little
astringent
o
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
might
be
the
worst
ive
had
from
dark
horse
i
dont
know
if
it
could
be
the
possible
age
problem
or
what
but
this
beer
really
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
o
i
really
like
it
for
the
heavily
pronounced
oatmeal
flavor
other
than
that
its
ok
i
dont
hate
it
or
love
it
id
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
for
an
oatmeal
stout
with
robust
flavor
after
some
of
my
previous
reviews
im
coming
to
the
realization
that
dark
horse
stouts
may
just
not
be
what
this
jive
turkey
prefers
to
spend
his
scratch
on
o
this
is
very
tasty
stout
creamy
and
smooth
as
usual
a
good
offering
from
the
guys
at
dark
horse
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
2
inch
super
dark
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
toasted
oats
dark
malts
cocoa
and
slight
coffee
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
maltsoats
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
but
all
very
diluted
in
flavor
mild
roastburntbitterastringent
taste
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
is
pretty
thin
and
slightly
watery
for
being
an
oatmeal
stout
decent
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
is
off
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
and
would
be
much
better
if
the
mouthfeel
were
tweaked
a
bit
o
decent
oatmeal
stout
and
one
i
would
drink
again
if
i
was
offered
one
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
o
pretty
standard
oatmeal
stout
imo
that
being
said
i
would
drink
it
again
i
think
if
they
increased
the
hops
on
this
they
would
have
a
pretty
solid
aba
skal
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
a
lot
of
oatmeal
stouts
tend
to
be
lighter
and
more
sessionable
but
this
was
was
heavier
roasty
and
robust
i
liked
that
because
theres
a
lot
more
lighter
oatmeal
stouts
on
the
market
so
its
nice
when
a
brewery
uses
the
oatmeal
stout
base
for
a
bigger
beer
this
beer
was
pretty
on
point
with
only
a
couple
minor
tweaks
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
on
the
market
in
terms
of
the
stout
series
i
thought
the
tres
was
the
best
with
too
and
one
tying
for
second
and
fore
being
the
one
i
liked
the
least
overall
dark
horse
did
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
series
now
i
have
to
try
and
track
down
plead
the
fith
you
would
think
that
living
in
michigan
it
would
be
easy
to
find
but
it
isnt
i
could
see
keeping
this
around
in
the
fridge
but
i
think
i
liked
shorts
mystery
stout
a
little
more
if
you
are
stout
lover
then
this
beer
is
for
you
this
was
another
good
stout
from
dark
horse
and
part
of
the
best
stout
series
around
d
drinkability
is
moderately
low
this
beer
looks
good
in
the
glass
but
its
downhill
from
there
mundane
flavors
that
bring
out
a
bit
too
much
roast
and
not
enough
tantalizing
qualities
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
o
its
an
alright
beer
it
was
just
a
little
bland
poured
into
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
completely
opaque
black
with
a
thin
light
mocha
brown
head
aroma
was
ok
slightly
fake
smokey
with
a
tad
of
alcohol
aroma
a
bit
of
burnt
brown
sugar
as
well
taste
started
off
as
smokey
burnt
coffee
progressed
into
an
acidic
bitter
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
coated
decently
and
was
nicely
carbonated
overall
was
just
ok
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
as
smooth
and
velvety
as
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
without
it
being
too
viscous
this
beer
just
flows
effortlessly
its
perfectly
bodied
as
it
never
feels
close
to
watery
but
never
feels
too
thick
either
the
acidity
offers
good
contrast
and
the
finish
is
softly
bitter
drinkability
great
for
all
those
reasons
along
with
the
clean
and
crisp
oatmeal
flavor
love
this
beer
its
an
oatmeal
stout
done
right
o
this
whole
series
of
stouts
has
been
pretty
solid
i
enjoyed
this
one
d
this
was
a
good
but
not
great
oatmeal
stout
would
have
like
a
bigger
oat
flavor
also
some
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
some
guess
i
would
drink
again
if
it
was
available
these
guys
just
cant
seem
to
make
a
bad
stout
poured
almost
still
and
almost
black
i
saw
a
little
bit
of
head
in
others
glasses
though
so
i
guess
well
say
it
can
have
a
small
head
aroma
is
bacon
like
and
smoky
but
still
roasty
this
one
packs
in
some
nice
coffee
flavors
with
a
deep
roasted
malt
and
some
burnt
toast
character
just
slightly
fruity
with
some
raisin
and
dark
fruit
character
very
good
based
on
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
was
a
bit
disapointed
as
their
stouts
go
this
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
special
reserve
black
bier
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
graham
cracker
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
however
choose
any
of
dark
horses
other
stouts
over
this
any
day
d
i
dont
want
to
drink
very
much
of
this
one
the
flavors
are
decent
but
im
just
not
digging
it
d
this
is
a
damn
fine
beverage
ill
put
it
up
there
with
sam
smiths
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
smooth
for
an
oatmeal
stout
absolutely
delicious
the
entire
way
through
the
alcohol
is
present
but
subtly
delicious
i
think
i
prefer
this
over
the
dark
horse
tres
blueberry
stout
poured
with
one
fat
finger
of
tan
head
subtle
smells
of
malts
and
chocolate
initial
tastes
of
bitter
sweet
chocolate
that
transitions
nicely
to
malty
creaminess
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
has
no
hint
of
heat
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
especially
on
tap
but
wouldnt
move
mountains
to
get
it
again
overall
solid
representation
of
a
refined
oatmeal
stout
well
done
dark
horse
drinkability
this
one
is
a
bit
too
bitter
and
dry
for
an
oatmeal
stout
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
in
the
style
while
too
and
tres
were
amazing
one
is
moreso
just
middle
of
the
pack
would
not
pass
this
one
up
if
given
would
not
seek
it
out
again
either
drinkability
lots
of
interesting
things
going
on
in
the
flavor
but
the
feel
leaves
some
to
the
imagination
i
tend
to
associate
oatmeal
stouts
with
great
mouthfeel
and
this
didnt
make
the
grade
still
good
though
pours
black
with
dark
brown
edges
and
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
roasty
mildly
burnt
oatmeal
sweetness
black
licorice
some
vanilla
and
some
chocolate
the
taste
is
rich
smooth
and
tasty
i
get
roasty
and
smoke
i
also
get
chocolate
smoothness
coffee
and
sweet
caramel
wow
everything
comes
together
nicely
very
very
tasty
brew
d
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
i
liked
the
smell
a
lot
and
the
taste
was
fine
but
seemed
a
little
watered
down
would
have
again
one
is
an
easydrinking
perfectly
serviceable
rendition
of
the
style
all
the
better
that
it
starts
to
gel
as
it
warms
up
d
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
stouts
and
oatmeal
stouts
d
on
a
positive
note
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easier
than
expected
especially
with
8
i
wouldnt
down
one
of
these
though
its
meant
to
be
savoured
another
nice
beer
from
dark
horse
one
of
these
would
suit
me
just
fine
the
roast
really
is
big
and
doesnt
really
leave
room
to
want
to
consume
another
a
fine
fine
stout
though
and
worth
picking
up
this
beer
poured
a
midnight
black
with
a
beautiful
dark
khaki
one
finger
head
which
quickly
dissipated
to
lace
the
glass
it
smells
of
very
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
has
decent
roasted
notes
the
coffee
is
pretty
subdued
and
it
also
has
almost
a
vanilla
accent
the
flavor
is
pretty
solid
its
slightly
smoky
and
has
a
little
oak
to
it
it
definitely
has
a
lot
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
has
a
solid
bitter
chocolate
flavor
that
follows
into
the
aftertaste
its
pretty
solid
but
the
more
you
drink
it
you
get
this
sweetsour
lactic
acid
flavor
that
kind
of
gets
a
little
old
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
and
is
in
between
medium
to
heavy
in
body
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
never
knew
it
was
8
i
wouldve
guessed
between
56
its
a
very
solid
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dark
horse
but
this
one
is
better
than
i
remember
it
d
very
easy
drinking
cos
another
good
offering
from
dark
horse
so
dark
horse
does
it
again
another
good
one
that
you
can
really
enjoy
good
flavor
in
this
stout
but
i
felt
the
drinkability
was
a
tad
rough
this
was
hard
for
me
to
finish
d
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
for
sure
ive
like
this
whole
line
from
them
this
one
is
good
but
some
of
the
other
have
been
better
that
doesnt
stop
this
from
being
enjoyable
and
true
to
style
pours
a
deep
pitch
black
with
a
thin
russet
brown
head
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
malts
tastes
of
coffee
with
undertones
of
chocolate
and
toffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
there
is
very
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
fairly
high
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
yet
there
are
some
small
but
furious
bubbles
that
emerge
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
on
the
way
down
very
very
drinkable
another
overall
success
from
dh
not
bad
but
nothing
special
ive
had
this
one
before
and
will
have
to
go
through
my
old
notes
to
see
not
sure
if
its
on
ba
yet
for
me
i
dont
remember
it
tasting
this
roasty
coffee
goodness
decent
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
d
goes
down
pretty
easily
somewhat
tasty
nice
kick
ok
representation
of
style
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
though
i
think
that
i
would
opt
for
others
of
the
style
if
given
an
option
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
wow
what
an
amazing
oatmeal
stout
dirty
roasted
earthen
tastes
perfect
oat
smoothness
and
chewiness
almost
no
hops
explicitly
present
just
tons
and
tons
of
hearty
roasted
malts
delicious
fantastic
beer
d
there
is
a
little
lingering
bitter
from
the
expresso
so
for
me
itd
be
something
id
pair
a
dessert
or
something
with
i
love
the
dark
horse
stout
series
but
i
think
this
one
might
fall
in
bottom
of
the
5
for
me
drinkability
not
as
smooth
or
complex
as
expected
for
an
oatmeal
stout
of
this
abv
pretty
good
but
not
a
standout
pours
a
black
color
nice
carbonation
little
fizzy
dark
tan
head
with
some
very
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
big
on
malts
with
some
very
nice
chocolatetoffeecaramel
notes
with
some
licorice
thrown
in
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
lots
of
dark
stuff
medium
body
with
a
nice
slightly
drybitter
finish
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
best
ive
had
highly
drinkable
overall
it
is
not
my
favorite
from
the
dark
horse
stout
lineup
that
would
be
plead
the
5th
but
this
is
yet
another
solid
offering
this
beer
pours
a
darkness
imprisoning
me
all
that
i
see
absolute
horror
sorry
i
couldnt
resist
how
many
dark
beers
are
named
one
well
as
i
was
saying
the
body
is
black
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
looks
damn
sexy
if
only
it
laced
better
it
was
almost
a
5
in
my
book
the
smell
is
not
too
strong
but
i
detected
cocoa
oats
and
some
vanilla
the
taste
had
a
bold
cocoa
and
oat
taste
combined
with
a
strong
coffeeroasted
flavor
there
was
also
a
bit
of
whiskey
in
the
background
the
carbonation
is
alright
on
the
palate
but
it
was
just
a
bit
too
watery
for
my
liking
this
was
still
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
got
even
better
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
and
became
smooth
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
d
a
very
tasty
brew
and
a
welcomed
seasonal
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
do
no
wrong
in
my
book
so
what
if
its
more
of
an
imperial
style
this
is
way
too
tasty
to
pass
up
this
is
a
miss
from
dark
horse
i
usually
love
their
beers
but
not
one
that
i
am
going
to
come
back
to
any
time
soon
to
much
acrid
burnt
and
astringent
flavors
going
on
not
the
worst
thing
ever
but
nothing
i
would
really
recommend
wheres
the
oatmeal
this
is
closer
to
a
double
stout
its
kind
of
a
mess
drinkability
is
good
perhaps
too
good
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
definitely
worth
the
try
d
warms
the
mouth
and
the
body
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
with
a
ton
of
flavor
and
personality
fitting
for
this
brewery
and
the
stout
series
i
can
picture
myself
and
many
others
sitting
at
the
brewpub
sucking
these
down
en
masse
on
a
cold
michigan
night
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
for
the
style
has
a
nice
full
body
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
the
flavor
isnt
outstanding
but
it
is
good
and
the
beer
has
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
stout
not
a
great
one
i
will
buy
it
again
depending
on
the
price
db
very
nice
use
of
roast
malt
and
oatmeal
a
drinkable
stout
that
goes
down
smooth
i
cant
even
believe
it
is
8
it
drinks
like
56
a
good
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
lately
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
improves
on
most
of
the
ones
your
average
oatmeal
stout
falls
on
a
really
schizophrenic
beer
i
liked
everything
but
the
taste
too
roasty
for
me
a
little
abrasive
i
kept
waiting
for
it
to
warm
up
the
malts
to
gain
some
steam
but
that
dark
burnt
character
still
dominated
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
oatmeal
roast
and
coffee
notes
in
the
taste
roast
malt
and
coffee
and
nice
sweet
oatmeal
and
a
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
coffee
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
and
nice
dry
to
sweet
complexity
d
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
actually
8
alcohol
but
it
definitely
drinks
like
4
very
nice
for
the
style
but
the
body
could
be
a
little
bit
lighter
go
lers
drinks
pretty
well
not
terribly
complex
but
tasty
and
with
the
8
abv
well
integrated
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
one
i
wouldnt
turn
down
either
drinkability
is
somewhat
meh
with
some
boozy
flavors
that
briny
salty
taste
the
coffee
grinds
and
acidic
flavors
and
overall
heaviness
the
only
thing
helping
it
is
the
smooth
oatmeal
feel
this
beer
is
much
bigger
than
it
should
be
for
an
oatmeal
stout
and
closer
to
a
ris
way
too
much
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
the
bit
of
smoke
is
nice
but
there
are
too
many
other
flavors
pounded
into
this
one
beer
the
best
beer
ive
had
yet
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
pretty
decent
stout
with
some
nice
robust
flavors
but
i
was
really
let
down
by
the
mouthfeel
i
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
to
be
silky
smooth
if
you
are
looking
for
a
rich
and
robust
stout
this
one
will
definitely
have
you
covered
d
not
a
great
flavor
its
fine
did
not
enjoy
drinking
and
would
not
purchase
again
drinkability
is
not
great
with
the
combination
of
the
intense
roastiness
and
the
carbonation
drinks
fairly
easy
but
the
abv
does
assert
itself
a
bit
i
could
still
pound
a
4
pack
on
a
winters
night
with
some
fudge
or
brownies
no
problem
drinkable
i
want
another
now
dammit
d
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
stout
i
like
how
they
come
in
12oz
bottles
if
only
i
could
only
get
them
by
me
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
somewhat
creamy
carbonation
is
moderate
to
below
average
excellent
mouthfeel
for
my
taste
drinkability
is
good
it
was
a
very
taste
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
maybe
my
favorite
in
the
series
recommended
for
sure
d
not
bad
still
a
decent
stout
but
not
as
much
flavor
as
some
other
stouts
ive
had
id
still
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
chillier
night
quite
a
nice
relaxing
brew
i
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
see
it
another
winner
from
this
brewery
im
becoming
more
and
more
impressed
by
dark
horses
stout
offerings
d
not
too
bad
for
an
8
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
however
d
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
your
stouts
chocolatey
drinkability
is
relatively
low
for
the
style
it
really
drinks
like
a
much
fatter
beer
than
the
8
suggests
thanks
to
walt
for
sharing
this
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tiny
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
chocolate
with
some
soy
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
chocolate
tobacco
and
leather
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
despite
the
high
abv
and
the
basic
nature
of
this
type
of
beer
this
one
is
very
drinkable
md
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
the
weak
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
but
there
are
many
better
oatmeal
stouts
all
in
all
this
is
a
more
than
solid
oatmeal
stout
and
a
beer
i
would
certainly
try
again
amazing
drinkability
for
lack
of
a
better
adjective
for
a
hefty
stout
such
as
this
this
is
a
great
brew
great
stout
flavor
with
a
complexity
that
rolls
from
one
end
of
your
tongue
to
the
other
wellbalanced
with
prominent
roastiness
and
coffee
flavors
very
nice
stout
with
a
nice
little
kick
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
can
find
it
theyve
got
a
winner
here
in
my
books
a
nice
enough
beer
summary
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
not
bad
some
more
sweetness
would
have
been
welcome
to
help
balance
out
all
of
that
dark
biterness
but
the
oatmeal
saved
the
day
in
the
end
helping
keep
this
smooth
on
the
palate
dark
horse
always
has
great
ideas
with
their
stouts
but
i
wish
they
would
have
taken
a
little
more
time
or
care
with
their
products
better
ingredients
or
more
time
to
refine
these
beers
is
really
all
they
need
until
then
its
fun
while
it
lasts
but
never
again
dthis
was
a
fairly
good
beer
but
i
personally
expect
more
richness
in
a
stout
maybe
im
just
spoiled
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
overall
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
drinkable
at
least
d
very
drinkable
beer
dark
horse
has
this
problem
with
making
great
beers
all
the
time
i
have
yet
to
have
something
from
them
that
i
didnt
like
nice
stout
that
i
could
drink
a
entire
4
pack
of
no
problem
na
zdravje
d
definitely
an
enjoyable
stout
glad
i
tried
this
one
d
a
good
stout
that
losses
its
oatmeal
persona
rather
quickly
i
like
the
fullness
of
the
finish
d
without
being
too
roasted
and
bitter
one
is
a
smooth
delicious
treat
thats
a
good
drinking
oatmeal
stout
the
nose
could
use
some
bringing
up
though
im
even
more
excited
to
have
the
tres
now
d
a
fairly
good
stout
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
but
i
found
it
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
the
strength
and
would
just
prefer
more
balance
with
sweet
and
roasted
elements
also
i
just
won
4
on
a
lotto
scratch
off
awesome
ho
boy
this
is
one
tasty
beer
poured
with
smallish
burnt
sugar
colored
head
that
mostly
subsided
and
no
lace
color
is
an
opaque
brownish
black
aroma
is
very
rich
roasty
malty
sweet
cocoa
hint
of
coffee
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
burnt
sugar
and
toffee
flavors
about
the
same
also
with
nut
skins
good
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
fairly
long
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
end
very
nice
beer
could
be
a
session
for
slow
drinking
would
go
great
with
very
rich
powerful
foods
like
game
dark
meat
fowl
and
spicey
sausages
d
this
felt
more
like
a
flimsy
ris
without
the
aggressive
bitterness
on
the
palate
however
this
bottle
had
a
bit
of
age
under
its
belt
about
a
year
and
a
half
or
so
i
look
forward
to
trying
too
tres
and
fore
in
the
near
future
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
not
quite
what
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
could
be
and
the
look
and
feel
were
just
not
up
to
scratch
for
a
stout
of
its
size
a
little
more
boldness
in
the
nose
and
taste
would
help
too
a
relatively
sweet
imperial
stout
though
the
sweet
milk
sugar
notes
were
probably
the
most
interesting
aspect
of
the
beer
rename
this
an
imperial
milk
stout
and
beef
up
the
palate
then
youd
have
something
perhaps
for
now
ill
pass
on
this
one
future
outlook
old
bottle
perhaps
though
even
if
id
hope
an
8
stout
would
hold
up
a
bit
more
pleasantly
ive
had
this
a
few
times
before
its
good
but
there
is
something
missing
maybe
its
the
heavy
carbonation
8
is
pretty
high
abv
for
this
type
of
stout
it
doesnt
seem
that
high
though
i
would
probably
get
this
again
as
it
is
my
second
4
pack
of
this
stuff
i
have
bought
this
winter
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
outstanding
worth
giving
it
a
taste
for
sure
notes
this
is
a
really
satisfying
oatmeal
stout
crafted
by
the
masters
at
dark
horse
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
it
has
the
presence
of
beers
that
get
a
lot
more
attention
here
on
ba
d
descent
dark
horse
offering
but
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
lacks
serious
complexity
and
the
finish
is
a
little
rough
like
all
oatmeal
stouts
the
body
on
this
is
creamy
and
smooth
carbonation
level
is
hidden
well
as
this
is
just
a
velvety
beer
alcohol
presence
gives
a
good
bit
of
body
on
top
good
mellow
flavors
come
out
with
oats
chocolate
and
dark
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
stout
right
here
its
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
so
i
wouldnt
have
many
at
a
time
but
its
a
good
treat
when
i
do
d
i
can
feel
all
8
even
after
half
of
a
glass
not
a
sipper
but
a
bit
too
cloying
and
fruity
to
want
more
than
one
d
very
drinkable
but
the
weak
point
is
definitely
the
finish
and
aftertaste
still
it
was
tasty
enough
for
me
to
have
two
in
a
sitting
without
complaint
next
review
one
is
kind
of
smooth
and
somewhat
milky
the
body
is
medium
and
could
use
a
boost
as
a
bit
of
a
watery
feel
is
on
the
end
carbonation
is
very
low
and
kind
of
makes
this
stout
a
bit
dead
in
the
water
the
chocolate
is
what
stays
with
me
the
most
im
glad
i
bought
one
bottle
as
i
did
not
want
another
one
afterwards
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
but
its
not
that
its
just
that
i
need
more
oats
this
is
good
for
a
whirl
though
pours
pitch
black
completely
opaque
body
does
not
let
any
visible
light
pass
through
nice
deep
mocha
tan
head
leaves
speckled
lacing
behind
all
of
their
beers
so
far
have
had
a
peculiar
sort
of
fizzy
carbonation
when
you
first
pour
the
beer
however
when
you
go
to
sip
it
the
excess
carbonation
doesnt
come
through
on
the
palate
aromatics
offer
up
deep
fruit
notes
amongst
the
dark
roasts
with
a
creamy
cereal
grain
breakfast
brew
approach
from
the
oatmeal
additions
some
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
from
the
darker
roasts
with
a
layer
of
carameltoffee
flowing
minimal
hops
going
on
here
the
fruit
tone
has
some
deep
plum
mild
tartness
and
a
noticeable
alcohol
nose
not
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
hops
maybe
some
faint
herbal
additions
flavors
meld
nicely
the
soft
oatmeal
with
the
dark
bitter
roasts
and
fruit
tone
background
a
bit
of
coffee
and
the
dark
chocolate
but
the
toffee
burnt
caramelized
sugar
note
really
shines
through
ample
herbal
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
burn
from
the
8
abv
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
ticklin
from
the
carbonation
but
overall
a
fuller
bodied
offering
with
the
oatmeal
additions
keeping
it
soft
and
velvety
on
the
palate
bitter
dark
roasts
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
burn
stay
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
drinkability
overall
is
solid
a
beer
that
inspires
me
to
want
to
search
out
too
tres
and
fore
from
the
same
series
of
stouts
its
true
i
love
dark
beer
from
the
state
of
michigan
this
one
is
no
different
go
try
some
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
from
dark
horse
not
the
best
one
i
have
had
but
very
good
and
well
worth
seeking
out
this
quality
beer
only
makes
me
even
more
pumped
to
try
the
other
four
beers
in
the
series
next
up
is
their
sweetmilk
stout
overall
another
solid
stout
from
dark
horse
ive
now
had
1
and
5
one
and
fifth
so
i
need
to
see
out
2
3
and
4
too
tres
and
fore
i
liked
pleading
the
fifth
a
little
more
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
if
you
like
it
a
little
heavy
with
some
good
boozy
flavors
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
nice
smell
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
emanting
from
the
fresh
pour
had
a
definite
taste
combination
of
roasted
oatmeal
and
coffee
with
slight
lingering
hints
of
chocolate
warms
you
like
a
good
winter
warmer
but
without
the
abundant
presence
of
alcohol
taste
a
robust
beer
that
lingers
nicely
on
the
palate
but
is
surprisingly
smooth
going
down
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
is
great
bought
another
4
great
beer
opaque
black
color
with
a
dark
tanmocha
head
starts
off
looking
very
pretty
but
quickly
recedes
to
a
ring
with
little
lacing
strong
aroma
of
roast
malt
toasted
grain
mild
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
all
malt
in
the
aroma
no
hoppiness
smooth
and
silky
medium
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
resulting
in
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
burnt
malt
and
sweet
chocolate
flavor
is
supported
by
strong
roasted
malt
presence
and
a
balance
of
burnt
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
oats
provide
a
light
grain
texture
but
not
as
strong
as
expected
for
the
style
overall
sweetness
is
mild
and
there
is
no
hop
presence
the
8
alcohol
makes
a
fleeting
appearance
in
the
finish
maybe
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
but
in
general
fits
nicely
with
this
series
of
stouts
from
dark
horse
tres
is
still
my
favorite
though
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
could
be
quite
good
with
a
little
less
alcohol
present
on
the
palate
otherwise
very
nice
drinkability
warms
you
up
but
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
in
flavour
the
first
handful
of
sips
were
interesting
and
but
by
the
time
i
reached
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
flavour
had
gotten
a
bit
boring
g
good
flavor
and
an
easy
drinker
id
put
it
up
there
with
my
favorites
in
the
category
the
poet
being
one
of
them
while
not
as
smooth
as
some
others
the
flavor
profile
is
just
great
id
definitely
drink
it
again
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
one
is
another
fine
beer
in
the
stout
series
let
there
be
no
doubt
this
is
very
good
beer
i
cant
help
but
think
of
how
good
this
would
be
with
a
bitter
hop
kick
that
missing
element
would
drive
this
beer
to
the
next
level
even
though
its
not
here
its
still
very
good
ill
enjoy
every
last
drop
if
you
havent
checked
out
this
series
you
should
i
still
need
to
find
a
bottle
of
tres
to
complete
the
lineup
but
im
extremely
impressed
thus
far
thank
you
dark
horse
for
finding
your
way
into
ohio
were
incredibly
happy
to
have
you
this
beer
poured
an
almost
black
color
and
formed
a
nice
solid
foamy
dark
tan
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
coffee
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
anise
the
flavor
was
of
malt
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
body
is
medium
light
with
a
bit
of
richness
to
it
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
not
a
bad
stout
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
brown
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
oatmeal
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
a
smoky
aroma
however
the
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malt
charredburnt
malt
and
some
oatmeal
the
taste
is
a
lot
more
bitter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
at
least
compared
to
the
aroma
anyway
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
rich
creamy
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
does
hit
you
after
drinking
it
but
you
cant
tell
its
8
abv
in
the
taste
at
all
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
it
again
thanks
dark
horse
anxiously
awaiting
the
arrival
of
too
through
plead
the
5th
in
the
up
coming
months
one
of
the
best
oatmeals
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
try
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
those
who
enjoy
a
stout
with
a
mild
open
and
smooth
enjoyable
bitter
finish
d
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
kinda
like
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
with
a
creamier
and
fuller
mouthfeel
i
loved
this
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
great
aftertaste
and
i
immediately
wanted
another
bottle
after
i
finished
this
beer
tall
two
finger
chocolatte
head
thick
and
foamy
one
is
opaque
black
ink
motor
oil
black
thick
sheets
of

beautiful
looking
stout
smell
is
chocolate
biscotti
wafer
tiramisu
chocolate
milk
tastes
wonderful
rich
full

vanilla

with

roast
chocolate

esspresso
there
is
a

astringency
in
the
mix
but
not
out
of
proportion
creamy
layered
mouthfeel
again
more
hop
astingency
nicey
balanced
and
tasty
overall
this
is
quite
possibly
my
favourite
of
the
first
four
dark
horse
offerings
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
heartily
recommended
pours
a
very
beautiful
black
color
i
mean
really
black
even
the
thinnest
part
of
the
pour
is
as
dark
as
some
completely
poured
stouts
however
the
head
is
kind
of
thin
very
thin
actually
and
dissipates
in
about
10
seconds
the
color
has
it
but
the
head
does
not
the
smell
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
a
bit
of
that
oily
sweetness
that
oats
seem
to
lend
theres
a
bit
of
a
toasty
bread
caramel
body
in
there
but
the
roasted
malts
win
the
taste
comes
out
with
chocolate
and
incredible
dense
grainy
husky
oatmeal
sweetness
the
sweetness
though
isnt
very
sugary
its
just
like
heavy
burnt
syrup
you
get
to
this
deep
roastiness
next
not
exactly
full
of
coffee
probably
because
of
the
burnt
toast
kind
of
hides
it
but
it
comes
through
nicely
the
taste
surpasses
most
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
think
i
can
see
some
room
for
improvement
the
raw
graininess
is
interesting
but
it
does
too
much
to
hide
the
roasted
flavors
the
body
is
s
o
incredibly
full
i
can
hardly
swallow
it
i
like
some
body
so
that
isnt
too
bad
but
the
carbonation
just
stings
which
is
kind
of
strange
id
say
that
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
impressive
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
the
abv
is
pretty
high
you
dont
exactly
notice
it
in
the
taste
but
i
actually
find
myself
enjoying
this
its
definitely
interesting
and
worth
a
try
i
can
actually
imagine
buying
this
again
smooth
full
creamy
feel
slides
over
the
tongue
with
little
carbonation
the
texture
is
as
thick
as
it
looks
taste
is
a
little
subtler
than
expected
but
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
this
is
one
big
oatmeal
stout
a
perfect
offering
to
try
on
a
cold
rainy
day
d
i
love
that
dark
horse
does
their
5
stout
series
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
styles
i
personally
like
the
plead
the
5th
the
most
this
one
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
was
wishing
for
a
little
more
balance
the
sweetness
effectivley
masks
the
high
alcohol
content
definitely
worth
a
try
every
now
and
then
considering
how
affordable
it
is
but
nothing
earth
shattering
here
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
modest
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
the
taste
chocolate
first
then
coffee
feel
is
full
bodied
and
oily
with
enough
carbonation
to
give
the
tongue
a
workout
drinkability
was
ok
for
a
heavy
8
00
abv
beer
1xbottap1x
drinkability
with
wellhidden
alcohol
this
beer
is
a
first
rate
oatmeal
stout
that
verges
on
the
double
stout
category
bottle
pours
an
inky
black
with
hardly
any
head
aroma
of
rich
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
molasses
toffee
graham
crackers
and
booze
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
oatmeal
graham
crackers
and
roasted
malt
in
the
finish
nice
robust
palate
seems
a
bit
strong
to
be
classified
as
a
stout
rather
than
an
imperial
stout
but
oh
well
very
nice
rbsg09
bottle
at
the
grand
tasting
pours
black
with
a
huge
fluffy
brown
head
aroma
is
coppery
smells
like
a
penny
tastes
underneath
that
there
are
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
flavor
is
dark
chocolate
with
a
fat
roasted
character
a
little
astringent
definitely
the
weakest
of
the
dh
seasonal
stout
series
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
great
balance
and
body
that
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
of
these
great
beers
d
despite
how
lighter
in
body
it
is
it
is
still
a
sipper
beer
there
are
nice
complexities
that
deserve
attention
with
each
taste
this
beer
is
decent
but
its
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
stout
series
id
buy
it
again
maybe
next
year
when
they
come
out
again
but
it
isnt
something
im
going
to
spend
any
effort
considerable
effort
seeking
out
taste
is
quite
smooth
and
mollow
a
present
degree
of
malt
is
present
followed
by
a
hoppy
bitter
taste
with
hints
of
roasted
coffee
vanilla
and
shy
alcohol
presence
vanilla
and
cherry
flavours
are
present
and
tickle
the
tongue
d
quite
tasty
filling
warming
without
knowing
the
abv
this
feels
like
6
and
as
such
would
be
a
beer
to
respect
before
getting
too
carried
away
a
12
oz
bottle
seems
just
right
would
gladly
have
this
again
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
not
the
best
but
far
from
the
worst
that
ive
had
glad
i
got
to
try
it
despite
how
i
sound
kind
of
negative
about
this
i
find
it
to
be
pretty
drinkable
if
it
were
on
my
local
store
shelves
id
buy
it
ive
seen
a
couple
of
reviews
stating
that
its
got
8
0abv
if
this
is
true
its
beautifully
hidden
id
have
guessed
it
in
5
and
below
range
very
drinkiable
brew
with
plenty
going
on
inside
why
cant
you
get
this
stuff
in
massachusets
barely
produced
any
head
but
the
head
that
there
is
is
a
nice
brown
color
body
is
of
course
black
as
one
would
expect
the
smell
is
like
molasses
and
chocolate
very
dessertlike
more
roasted
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
a
dark
black
color
pour
with
a
mediumlasting
coco
colored
head
aroma
of
chocolatesmokeburnt
maltand
coffee
flavor
is
rich
malty
and
sweetchocolatecoffeedark
fruittobacco
and
a
light
bitterness
that
seems
to
be
more
from
the
chocolate
and
coffee
than
hops
full
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeeland
a
espresso
type
lingering
finish
very
very
good
stout
dark
horse
makes
some
damn
fine
stout
pours
unspectacular
but
still
attractive
dark
with
minimal
head
that
disappears
quickly
one
whiff
and
you
can
already
smell
the
oatmeal
in
it
which
comes
over
pretty
sweetly
taste
is
definitely
good
with
a
strong
prevalence
of
oatmeal
and
hints
of
licorice
and
dark
coffee
has
decent
smooth
mouthfeel
but
nothing
spectacular
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
of
which
i
wish
i
had
many
more
of
12oz
poured
black
with
no
transparency
zero
head
to
speak
of
initially
until
i
poured
from
almost
a
foot
above
the
glass
2
inch
head
eventually
appeared
following
the
pour
chocolate
in
color
actually
not
bad
considering
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
but
it
did
eventually
rise
up
but
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
alcohol
coffee
and
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
gets
smoother
as
the
ale
warms
tastes
are
simple
roasted
malts
somewhat
oaty
faint
alcohol
which
is
well
concealed
given
the
8
abv
coffee
and
chocolate
finish
is
dry
but
not
overly
it
appears
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
most
according
to
its
overall
score
as
i
was
drinking
it
i
was
thinking
it
might
be
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
to
date
this
one
actually
finishes
much
better
than
it
starts
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
jet
balckused
motor
oil
color
with
very
little
head
from
the
outset
and
no
lacing
likewise
the
nose
is
very
faint
and
almost
indistinguishable
but
things
get
better
from
here
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sweet
and
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
toffee
8
alcohol
is
very
subtly
pleasant
in
the
taste
as
well
and
this
all
blends
to
a
finish
that
is
long
and
just
sweet
enough
d
definitely
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
the
lighter
body
makes
for
a
beer
you
can
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
at
each
sitting
im
becoming
more
and
more
impressed
with
dark
horse
brews
this
is
yet
another
ill
have
to
plan
on
picking
up
a
fourpack
of
d
not
sure
on
the
abv
on
this
but
id
guess
6
quite
a
nice
drinkable
and
semicomplex
oatmeal
stout
smooth
but
better
carbonation
could
have
really
knocked
this
one
into
a
higher
category
has
the
consistency
of
flat
soda
delicious
this
is
a
standout

version
of
the
style
mediumfull

with
a
somewhat
thin

this
is
not
a
knockthesocksoff
stout
but
one
is
really
good
solid
and
delicious
id
like
it
to
be
a
little
more
brash
but
its
difficult
to
complain
when
its
tasty
smooth
and
original
very
good
stuff
yet
again
from

a
goto

which
lets
no

barely
muster
up

the

someone
send
me
a
fresh
one
please
notes
similar
to
the

by

in
most
respects
with
a
slightly
smoother

and
taste
overall
very
drinkable
very
good
and
just
a
delicious
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
just
about
anytime
but
especially
on
these
cold

nights
cheers
got
a
four
pack
of
these
to
split
with
a
buddy
one
morning
oatmeals
legit
right
a
solid
beer
sure
appearance
was
mediocre
small
head
that
dissipated
to
absolutely
nothing
over
a
deep
brown
brew
not
a
hint
of
lacing
nose
and
flavor
were
solid
sweet
chocolate
a
touch
of
caramel
and
then
a
heavy
dose
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
body
was
solid
medium
to
thick
and
appropriate
for
the
style
overall
another
nice
one
from
dark
horse
definitely
still
one
of
the
better
mi
breweries
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
lancaster
shaker
glass
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
caramel
colored
foam
the
foam
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
smells
of
roasted
grains
and
faintly
of
sweet
caramel
tastes
of
bitter
cocoa
powder
and
rich
dark
roasted
malts
creamy
body
with
medium
carbonation
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
another
solid
offering
from
dark
horse
dstrong
drinkability
enjoyable
throughout
smooth
and
tasty
although
not
perfectly
it
fits
nicely
into
the
oatmeal
stout
style
left
me
satisfied
and
wanting
to
try
more
from
dark
horse
including
perhaps
another
bottle
of
this
very
nice
overall
smooth
balanced
creamy
stout
well
done
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
in
the
series
full
bodied
silkysmooth
and
creamy
alcohol
only
shows
as
a
welcome
warmth
goes
down
easy
and
is
finished
too
soon
a
delicious
oatmeal
stout
for
morning
noon
or
night
of
the
two
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
tried
so
far
i
enjoyed
the
poet
more
nice
opaque
pour
with
an
off
whitish
head
roasted
aroma
from
a
nice
tan
head
good
roasted
malt
just
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
dark
horse
likes
to
hop
their
brews
this
has
a
hint
of
that
not
too
much
though
very
good
representation
of
the
style
worth
trying
along
with
their
other
number
brews
full
bodied
creamy
texture
with
a
nice
warmth
to
it
this
is
a
nice
morning
sipper
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
good
beer
dark
horse
thanks
tristan
just
a
quick
dark
brown
foam
of
head
after
great
pour
the
perfect
pitch
black
color
though
very
interesting
smell
of
oatey
peanut
butter
plus
some
savory
dark
rasted
coffee
and
a
small
wedge
of
bakers
chocolate
faint
chesnuts
in
a
delicious
french
roasted
coffee
just
the
way
i
like
it
too
black
then
the
dry
powdered
dark
chocolate
slowly
makes
itself
known
but
only
in
the
most
subtle
of
ways
smooth
oily
slick
yet
also
dry
palate
the
thick
roasted
malt
flavors
just
coats
the
tongue
a
solid
all
around
stout
it
has
the
great
flavors
associated
with
a
good
dark
beer
and
they
are
nicely
balanced
very
enjoyable
drink
that
i
am
thankful
for
having
after
a
wonderful
thanksgiving
dinner
what
a
treat
d
not
really
as
good
as
many
of
these
guys
other
beers
not
really
one
to
seak
out
but
drinkable
very
full
bodied
in
its
silky
texture
with
a
whole
lotta
flavor
in
the
mix
a
robust
toasted
malt
is
the
first
thing
noticed
with
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
flavor
backing
it
up
the
oatmeal
sweetness
surfaces
next
not
muting
the
bite
of
the
bitters
but
balancing
them
just
right
the
finish
is
warm
with
very
laid
backalmost
hidden
hop
presence
which
is
a
good
thing
in
such
brews
because
it
lets
the
oatmeal
and
malt
characteristics
do
what
theyre
suppose
to
do
instead
of
getting
stepped
all
over
in
the
end
d
im
really
enjoying
this
dh
do
know
to
make
a
good
stout
and
paired
with
chocolate
cake
this
really
is
a
treat
d
easy
to
drink
and
overall
pretty
solid
worth
a
try
for
sure
it
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
small
creamy
brown
that
quickly
recedes
and
moves
to
the
edges
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
this
is
odd
but
there
is
almost
no
smell
maybe
some
roasted
malts
but
there
is
almost
nothing
there
the
flavor
makes
up
for
what
the
smell
is
missing
there
is
a
nice
bite
to
it
and
its
just
right
for
the
cold
day
i
was
drinking
it
on
it
was
served
very
cold
but
warms
you
up
great
it
is
sweet
but
more
of
a
roasted
sweet
than
chocolate
sweet
the
8
abv
is
there
but
is
well
masked
by
the
flavors
of
vanilla
and
coffee
the
flavors
just
dance
in
you
mouth
and
the
finish
just
leaves
you
wanting
more
by
the
look
of
this
beer
you
would
think
it
would
be
a
sipper
but
its
surprisingly
drinkable
i
was
waiting
for
a
take
away
order
and
this
was
pretty
much
gone
after
10
15
mins
d
slow
drinker
but
good
very
nice
overall
leaves
me
wanting
more
of
it
great
representation
of
an
oatmeal
stout
d
not
dark
horses
best
offering
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
one
is
enough
and
i
probably
wont
pick
any
more
of
these
up
cant
tell
that
this
one
is
8abv
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
damn
tasty
oatmeal
stout
i
love
how
they
let
the
malt
do
the
talking
and
would
actually
be
surprised
if
a
hop
touched
this
beer
also
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
swear
that
chocolate
nips
or
something
of
the
sort
was
in
this
brew
good
stuff
m
medium
to
a
little
thin
lightly
carbonated
this
beer
pours
dark
black
with
an
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
bitter
chocolate
and
dark
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
little
thin
not
as
much
body
as
i
would
like
tastes
of
burnt
malts
chocolate
and
molasses
drinkability
is
not
great
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
one
but
it
didnt
leave
me
wanting
another
easy
to
drink
i
dont
find
there
to
be
anything
offensive
about
any
one
particular
part
of
this
brew
while
i
did
enjoy
this
it
isnt
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
body
seem
more
porter
like
than
stoutish
would
not
turn
this
one
down
would
buy
a
single
again
just
not
the
top
of
my
list
overall
a
decent
brew
but
i
wouldnt
consider
this
to
be
particularly
drinkable
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
there
is
a
very
short
lived
frothy
head
on
the
pour
but
alas
it
is
gone
before
i
get
to
my
chair
smell
is
slight
coffee
some
deep
black
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
dark
chocolate
this
smells
very
promising
you
get
a
bit
more
of
the
roasted
coffee
in
the
flavor
but
its
not
dominant
or
obtrusive
theres
just
enough
dark
chocolate
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
pretty
decent
and
fairly
smooth
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
roasted
barley
coffee
a
very
solid
good
offering
from
dark
horse
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
a
bit
of
creamyness
is
noted
to
the
moughfeel
the
flavors
linger
in
my
mouth
for
a
long
time
this
is
dam
near
perfect
the
only
negative
thing
about
this
beer
was
i
drank
it
too
fast
pours
oil
slick
black
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
small
dense
mocha
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
as
a
cap
and
then
left
a
ring
with
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
burnt
malts
with
espresso
and
licorice
there
is
also
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
smell
as
it
warms
with
milk
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
also
big
of
the
roastedburnt
malt
character
the
first
taste
is
a
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
blast
which
gives
way
to
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
lingers
through
the
finish
with
a
slight
coffee
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
little
carbonation
which
just
coats
the
mouth
with
the
massive
malt
flavors
this
is
a
good
if
fairly
onedimensional
roasty
stout
and
i
look
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
stout
series
pours
super
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
big
chocolatey
head
the
nose
is
chocolate
deep
dark
malts
subtle
sweet
vanilla
the
taste
is
chocolate
deap
roasty
malts
some

medium

very
delicious

oddly
enough
to
me
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
very
iight
with
a
semidry
finish
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
dark
horse
so
far
i
found
the
other
couple
i
tried
either
watered
down
or
unbalanced
nice
work
on
this
one
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
id
have
it
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
milky
pours
black
and
thick
from
the
bottle
slight
mocha
head
rises
and
fades
leaves
a
few
rogue
patches
of
lacing
smell
is
roasted

some
nice
dark
chocolate
aroma
maybe
a
trace
of
cookie

some
dark
fruitiness
plenty
of
burnt
coffee
some
milk

pretty
active
little
bubbles
with
a
slightly
drying

overall
a
tasty

had

smokey

overall
its
really
not
that
good
for
an
oatmeal
stout
its
a
bit
harsh
on
the
roasty
side
which
makes
it
less
drinkable
it
was
on

im
not
really
complaining

there

excellent

like
lots

that
run
over
the

and
develop
a

on

way
down
as
the
abv
kicks
up
the
flavors
lose
their
boldness
but
otherwise
no
complaints
this
will
will
be
my
new
go
to
when
i
have
a
hankering
for
a
staple
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
offering
by
dark
horse
pretty
nice
flavors
and
aromas
enjoyable
and
light
enough
to
drink
all
summer
long
i
wish
i
could
get
it
all
the
time
drinkability
one
and
done
man
d
it
was
watery
and
lacked
balance
however
none
of
the
flavors
left
an
adverse
impression
not
a
good
session
beer
pours
a
rich
dark
black
color
with
the
darkest
brown
head
ive
seen
on
any
oatmeal
stout
smell
is
lightly
smoky
stale
wet
cardboard
and
roasty
malt
rather
unimpressive
nose
actually
taste
is
rather
smoky
for
a
sweet
stout
or
oatmeal
with
decent
roasty
character
mouthfeel
is
just
average
with
light
carbonation
overall
disappointing
like
the
other
2
beers
ive
had
from
dark
horse
i
expected
more
and
this
seems
to
have
a
smoky
presence
that
doesnt
fit
the
style
and
is
a
bit
offputting
despite
the
fact
that
i
enjoy
smoked
beers
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
certainly
a
more
then
worthy
stout
and
a
great
introduction
to
what
they
can
do
at
dark
horse
with
well
a
dark
beer
it
was
a
little
more
of
a
hybrid
style
for
me
but
i
guess
and
imperial
oatmeal
stout
would
be
anyway
could
have
been
a
little
sweeter
but
this
was
still
excellent
by
all
means
a
very
good
beer
here
and
i
anxiously
await
trying
the
rest
of
the
series
d
another
solid
beer
from
dark
horse
but
the
burnt
astringent
taste
would
keep
from
from
having
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
dwas
not
expecting
to
like
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
from
the
full
winter
of
stout
overload
to
the
mediocre
appearence
i
just
was
not
expecting
much
this
is
just
a
really
nice
stout
which
is
hitting
the
spot
dan
ok
beer
but
not
for
me
d
im
sad
to
say
that
this
one
has
let
me
down
i
love
dark
horse
and
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
so
needless
to
say
i
was
excited
for
this
glad
i
got
to
try
it
just
ashame
it
let
me
down
dont
think
its
much
of
a
oatmeal
stout
its
by
no
means
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
i
do
feel
betrayed
by
the
looks
and
initial
smell
that
led
me
to
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
after
that
it
became
incomplete
so
dark
the
pouring
stream
is
opaque
generates
a
nice
fluffy
dark
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
the
smell
is
timid
yet
discernible
lightly
roasted
barley
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
very
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
heavy
and
smooth
without
an
aggressive
coating
presence
the
flavors
is
also
somewhat
reserved
there
is
a
tang
of
bitterness
but
mostly
a
nice
lightly
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
spot
of
coffee
that
lingers
nicely
a
really
good
drinker
shout
out
to
bigdaddywil
would
seem
to
be
an
imperial
oat
and
a
pretty
good
one
i
would
drink
this
again
tried
this
oatmeal
stout
from
dark
horse
id
never
seen
it
before
not
as
sweet
as
i
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
not
bad
but
not
that
great
decent
to
try
once
d
drinkable
but
quite
mediocre
overall
ill
pass
next
time
i
kinda
felt
this
was
disappointing
very
watery
and
bland
no
carbonation
heavy
bodied
though
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
to
anyone
but
its
not
bad
in
any
way
a
vigorous
pour
of
thes
oily
black
hole
bodied
brew
only
produces
a
half
an
inch
of
milk
chocolate
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
skim
in
a
couple
of
minutes
nose
has
notes
of
waxy
malt
and
earthy
oil
tones
it
is
rather
soft
though
the
initial
sip
yields
musky
alchol
and
spicey
malt
hues
it
is
thinner
in
body
than
i
would
expect
from
the
style
the
end
of
the
palate
develops
a
dry
mouthfeel
that
almost
resembles
dark
chocolate
the
musky
mouthfeel
is
really
a
dominating
point
to
this
beer
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
four
in
this
series
slightly
lacking
in
feel
more
like
an
english
porter
than
stout
light
with
some
very
mild
lactic
character
overall
a
cinch
to
drink
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stut
from
dark
horse
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
shrug
d
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
due
to
the
oats
added
smoothness
full
flavored
with
an
alcohol
content
that
doesnt
make
waves
recommended
a
pretty
solid
oaty
stout
with
a
calmingly
easy
milky
smooth
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
i
bought
two
4
packs
and
the
older
it
gets
the
less
i
like
it
good
beer
but
not
anything
to
wow
about
d
nice
stout
tad
off
balanced
but
still
a
good
time
good
use
just
a
smidge
of
sweetness
to
help
the
off
center
dry
charred
flavors
d
what
you
want
in
appearance
and
mouth
feel
but
lacks
in
taste
and
smell
was
this
too
cold
no
it
was
right
around
55
deg
meh
not
bad
in
anyway
just
not
the
whole
picture
a
solid
stout
easy
to
drink

a
bit
on
the
bitter
side

dark

has
put
together
a
nice
take
on
the
oatmeal

here
the
roasted

show
is
here
and
adds
a
touch
of
hops
to
the
performance
to
liven
things
up
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
run
into
it
last
year
i
got
my
hands
on

stout
blueberry
this
is
my
first
sampling
of
the
oatmeal
and
it
is
damn
fine
from
my
expierences
dark

makes
some
tasty
stouts

i
hope
they
keep
them

some

no

smells
roasty

taste
is
rather
sharp
and
bitter
tastes
good
but
drinkability
suffers
since
it
is
so
bitter
only
real
problem
is
that
it
doesnt
have
that
creamy
oat
flavor

no

through

of
tan

forms
and
quickly
falls
to
a
full
coat
over

there
are
a
few
bubbles
coming
up
as
well
the
nose
is
extremely
roasty
and
piny
from
hop
taking
a
more
deep
inhale
over
top
brings
a
little
of
the
mild
oat
character
it
feels
a
little
focused
towards
the
roast
and
hop
for
an
oatmeal
stout
taking
a
sip
i
find
an
initial
smooth
and
creamy
oat
character
overlaying
a
nicely
balanced
chocolate
sweet
and
roasted
sharpness
this
fades
to
a
very
nice
creamy
chocolate
finish
with
just
the
lightest
hint
of
coffee
throughout
there
is
a
very
green
pine
hop
just
laying
in
with
the
other
flavors
i
like
this
one
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
there
is
a
solid
moderate
body
that
is
very
smooth
only
a
slight
carbonation
comes
through
just
barely
breaking
that
feel
up
i
do
enjoy
this
brew
the
aroma
seems
to
be
a
little
skewed
towards
characteristics
that
dont
come
through
in
the
flavor
and
are
not
necessarily
what
i
would
consider
to
be
dominant
in
an
oatmeal
stout
this
is
one
that
i
would
certainly
visit
again
come
winter
if
i
could
find
it

as
well
in
the
nose
taste
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
of
an
oatmeal
stout
a
bit
too
smokey
starts
off
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
oats
but
is
then
dominated
by
the
roasted
barley
in
the
aftertaste
you
can
sense
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
but
not
enough
to
make
it
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
and
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
dont
think
i
could
have
another
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
from
dark
horse
drinkability
is
not
as
good
due
to
the
very
rich
and
thick
character
of
the
brew
the
complexity
and
balance
of
the
aroma
and
taste
is
only
heightened
by
a
full
body
and
a
rich
texture
very
well
crafted
brew
drinkability
not
a
bad
stout
i
dont
think
i
taste
any
oasts
though
pours
out
basically
black
with
a
minimal
amount
of
head
that
is
very
brown
looks
ok
not
much
aroma
mostly
stouty
dark
bitter
smells
like
coffee
and
chocolate
its
mostly
a
coffee
flavor
upon
the
first
sip
with
some
ripened
berry
flavor
too
decently
balanced
with
a
suitable
aftertaste
nice
in
the
mouth
plenty
smooth
but
maybe
a
tad
watery
for
the
most
part
went
down
easy
as
stouts
go
overall
pretty
good
my
favorite
of
the
dark
horse
stouts
very
solid
thanks
to
blankboy
black
as
midnight
thin
dark
brown
head
lace
is
moderate
slight
roastiness
and
a
little
bit
of
a
tannic
edge
to
it
on
the
nose
the
flavors
please
me
more
than
the
aromas
did
its
got
some
nice
stout
qualities
like
the
roasted
malts
and
some
definite
char
characteristics
some
dark
bitter
bakers
chocolate
a
little
anise
and
some
blackened
berries
nice
velvetly
feel
to
this
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
too
easy
give
me
a
mexican
mole
dish
with
this
and
im
smiling
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
very
dark
black
even
with
a
tiny
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
the
black
abyss
leaving
a
microring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
enjoyable
and
defined
semisweet
chocolate
burnt
coffee
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
charred
coffee
flavor
coming
to
the
forefront
but
it
is
well
balanced
by
the
slight
sweetness
of
the
oatmeal
and
finishes
very
smooth
i
read
from
another
bas
report
that
this
has
8
and
i
believe
it
but
i
cant
taste
it
well
done
the
mouthfeel
is
great
viscous
and
creamy
incredibly
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
i
will
have
to
make
a
point
to
pick
up
the
others
in
the
series
which
i
was
previously
unaware
of
d
way
more
roasted
smokey
and
bitter
than
i
expected
this
oatmeal
stout
to
be
regardless
this
is
very
enjoyable

these

what

the

it
from
being
great
ive
been
looking
for
dark
horse
beer
for
some
time
now
and
was
lucky
enough
to
run
across
the
entire
holiday
stout
series
several
days
ago
if
one
is
any
indication
of
the
quality
that
i
can
expect
from
too
tres
and
fore
then
it
will
be
all
i
can
do
to
restrain
myself
from
drinking
them
all
today
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
from
dark
horse
very
very
nice
highly
recommended
this
beer
had
a
black
pour
with
a
coffee
colored
head
sitting
on
top
taste
is
a
little
oatmeal
and
slightly
roasty
but
nothing
special
drinkability
wasnt
great
due
to
the
taste
not
being
very
enticing
oh
well
i
was
still
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
drink
this
midwestern
brew
dark
horses
winter
stout
series
is
one
of
my
favorite
things
going
in
american
craft
beer
its
subtle
creative
local
for
me
and
its
all
high
quality
drinkability
highly
drinkable
d
this
beer
is
smooth
but
there
is
no
real
depth
and
no
oatmeal
qualities
the
dark
malt
flavor
do
have
a
nice
flavor
that
makes
it
go
down
quickly
black
with
a
thick
brown
head
great
appearance
aroma
is
sweet
and
loaded
with
roasty
malts
cherries
and
chocolate
nice
balanced
sweet
fruitiness
and
bitter
oats
and
coffee
simple
but
yummy
balanced
feel
light
to
medium
bodied
slick
very
nice
exceptionally
drinkable
dark
black

creamier

head
almost
a
shot
of
espresso
with
barley
and
vanilla
and
licorice
injected
very
rich
and
a
quick
bitter
sweet
finish
good
finish
that
does
not
last
too
long
a
good
complex
blend
for
the
not
so
complicated
stout
and
is
a
pleasure
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
it
lacks
something
in
overall
depth
of
flavor
isnt
quite
as
smooth
as
others
ive
had
nothing
id
certainly
turn
down
but
it
just
seemed
to
be
missing
something
that
the
aroma
alluded
to
and
the
taste
left
out
and
thanks
to
trbeer
d
a
damn
fine
stout
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
bold
body
a
perfect
offering
for
those
cold
winter
eves
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
overall
an
awesomely
balanced
and
hearty
stout
to
say
the
least
halfway
through
the
bottle
when
the
temperature
warmed
up
a
bit
the
flavors
all
became
rounder
and
softer
again
making
it
more
truer
to
style
the
dry
sweet
bitter
all
danced
effortlessly
together
what
a
fantastic
stout
i
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
one
robust
malty
coffee
flavor
but
has
strange
lingering
aftertaste
i
say
give
it
a
try
and
see
what
happens
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
with
plenty
of
body
that
really
grabs
on
as
you
drink
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
another
good
brew
from
dark
horse
i
havent
had
a
bad
one
yet
thanks
to
hoppymeal

the

dug
it
for
the
most
part
and
i
do
thank
hoppymeal
for
the
bottle
this
stout
kicks
ass
really
though
it
lacks
pretty
much
any
head
whatsoever
and
i
mean
basically
no
head
it
is
a
mesmerizingly
pleasing
deep
caramelnearly
black
color
and
the
aroma
oh
boy
a
treat
in
itself
caramel
chocolate
here
i
come
the
only
thing
this
was
a
bit
weak
in
was
the
mouthfeel
but
only
in
comparison
to
other
oatmeal
stoutsit
was
surprisingly
light
for
its
type
this
is
simply
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
black
with
a
very
thin
skim
of
fine
dark
brown
bubbles
that
form
a
slender
ring
around
the
glass
some
lacing
particularly
after
some
agitation
rich
malty
aroma
plenty
of
roast
milk
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
caramel
moderate
bitterness
burnt
and
roasted
especially
towards
the
finish
bittersweet
chocolate
toasted
oats
some
acidity
in
the
finish
very
low
carbonation
thick
and
viscous
a
bit
of
creaminess
fairly
smooth
quite
tasty
almost
a
meal
in
itself
add
a
few
bubbles
and
this
would
really
be
good
it
is
still
a
good
mellow
stout
very
similar
to
a
milk
stout
in
flavor
this
is
more
or
less
a
stout
milkshake
add
ice
cream
and
make
a
float
a
pleasant
brew
with
a
good
deal
of
roasted
grain
complexity
despite
the
fact
that
the
body
could
have
used
a
bit
more
substance
there
is
a
great
showcase
of
flavor
packed
in
here
a
enjoyed
this
ale
but
then
again
if
i
was
going
to
go
for

sweet
burnt

with
a
slight
tang
in

closes
reasonably
dry
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
smooth
due
to
the
heavy
oat
use
and
drinkability
is
is
down
a
bit
due
to
a
preponderence
of
the
dark
malt
giving
it
a
slight
bitter
bent
that
seems
out
of
place
this
is
a
really
good
dry
stout

not
exactly
what
one
would

an
oatmeal

you
to

mayflower
does
dark
beers
well
solid
stout
go
check
out
this
brewery
i
love
this
beer
i
have
chose
it
as
my
winter
beer
of
choice
it
is
so
good
and
puts
you
in
the
mood
to
just
snuggle
up
and
crush
30
of
them
but
dont
or
you
will
be
hammered
its
a
great
local
brew
and
i
hope
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
you
do
very
good
stout
deed
black
in
color
a
bit
watery
for
my
taste
but
flavorful
a
delicious
stout
with
a
great
smell
i
really
enjoy
this
on
a
truly
frigid
day
sadly
we
havent
had
too
many
of
those
this
year
still
love
it
price
point

8912
oz
bottle
this
is
a
really
tasty
winter
beer
i
like
that
its
not
a
crazy
style
or
overdone
but
still
has
a
unique
taste
overall
really
nice
stout
from
these
plymouth
dudes
strikes
me
more
as
a
straightup
stout
than
an
oatmeal
stout
but
does
have
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
would
have
again
pours
quite
black
with
short
head
a
touch
of
mahogany
highlights
around
the
edges
the
aroma
isnt
very
strong
but
it
has
a
definite
roasty
quality
taste
follows
the
nose
a
touch
on
the
burnt
side
for
me
no
real
surprises
meets
expectations
which
are
higher
than
normal
due
to
the
brewer
feel
is
excellent
soft
and
clean
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
drinker
would
be
happy
to
have
again
o
the
pour
is
a
little
lackluster
in
appearance
but
all
other
aspects
are
there
the
peaty
smoke
really
adds
another
dimension
to
the
flavor
and
was
a
nice
surprise
since
this
isnt
declared
to
be
a
smoked
stout
overall
another
great
brew
from
mayflower
and
one
that
i
will
plan
to
revisit
o
a
good
stout
not
sure
why
it
is
winter
other
than
maybe
the
time
of
the
year
certainly
appropriate
for
that
happy
to
have
tried
and
definitely
worth
the
price
of
admission
but
i
probably
wont
rush
back
to
it
overall
for
a
nonimperial
read
thin
oatmeal
stout
this
is
good
no
one
will
write
a
book
or
even
a
post
about
this
beer
but
people
who
meet
it
will
say
oh
yeah
that
guy
that
was
surprisingly
good
when
they
hear
it
mentioned
in
passing
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
disappointing
it
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
seems
to
go
down
way
too
easy
it
is
a
little
too
carbonated
in
my
opinion
it
leaves
a
hint
of
a
coating
on
the
tongue
the
taste
has
a
smoky
creaminess
in
the
malt
character
that
abruptly
explodes
into
an
earthy
bitter
dryness
that
does
not
linger
long
oatmeal
can
also
be
found
it
definitely
has
some
very
nice
features
to
it
this
beer
pours
black
with
a
this
tan
head
this
beer
smells
of
coffee
oats
and
has
hits
of
malts
the
flavor
is
spot
on
in
my
opinion
with
caramel
coffee
oats
and
again
hits
of
malts
all
making
an
appearance
the
mouth
feel
was
pleasant
had
a
medium
body
but
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
would
have
thought
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
very
drinkable
pretty
uncomplicated
it
is
what
it
is
as
the
saying
goes
it
is
an
unpretentious
reasonably
flavorful
stout
that
is
worth
having
would
only
want
to
have
a
few
in
one
sitting
though
the
beer
pours
a
proper
black
with
a
slight
red
tinge
and
a
nice
light
tan
head
on
top
the
beers
body
is
too
dark
to
properly
judge
but
seems
clean
the
beer
leaves
a
lacing
that
is
light
and
slippery
leaving
very
little
to
look
at
on
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
wonderfully
rich
with
coffee
and
oatmeal
tones
roasted
barley
malts
also
come
through
on
the
nose
slightly
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
drying
with
a
nice
roasted
bitter
flavoring
the
beer
begins
with
a
little
watery
roasted
malt
before
opening
into
big
roasted
oat
flavors
with
touches
of
coffee
toffee
and
char
the
finish
brings
to
mind
sweet
oatmeal
bread
and
is
very
appealing
the
aftertaste
is
tingly
with
roasted
oatmeal
and
slight
coffee
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
that
lightly
prickles
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
dry
with
a
light
wet
sheen
of
saliva
on
the
sides
of
the
mouth
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
and
sessionable
there
is
a
lovely
roasted
oat
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
winter
and
a
warm
stove
for
some
reason
this
stout
will
not
blow
you
away
with
flavor
but
it
is
solid
and
tasty
and
fully
deserving
of
your
taste

judge
this
book
by
its
cover
flavor
was
where
its
at
what
im
getting
is
a
average
to
slightly
below
average
stout
i
would
have
preferred
more
body
and
flavor
i
dont
regret
purchasing
it
but
wouldnt
buy
again

not
much
going

here
its
smooth
and
pleasant
but
other
better
ooatmeal
stouts
exists
worth
a
try
o
an
average
oatmeal
stout
i
would
drink
this
again
but
honestly
wouldnt
buy
it
in
favor
of
other
oatmeal
stouts
or
mayflowers
ipa
which
is
very
good
o
a
real
tasty
brew
perfect
for
a
snowy
post
dinner
sipper
not
overly
rich
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
but
a
real
solid
brew
matches
the
quality
i
expect
from
mayflower
i
recommend
will
try
again
for
another
tasting
o
a
very
good
sweet
oatmeal
stout
mayflower
does
dark
beers
very
well
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
good
beer
that
is
well
worth
trying

solid
dark
brown

with
a
faint
garnet

quickly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
roasted
and
cereal
grains
milk
chocolate
caramel
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
rich
and
dark
chocolate
up

a
hint

caramel
light
earthy

flavor
with
little
to
no
hop
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
sweet
stout
i
enjoyed
it
pitch
black
with
little
head
it
doesnt
look
as
creamy
and
frothy
as
i
like
an
oatmeal
stout
to
be
aroma
provides
a
little
smoke
powdery
oats
peat
moss
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
nice
chocolate
and
oatmeal
are
definitely
there
charcoal
and
peat
moss
is
brought
to
mind
again
on
the
flavor
profile
but
chocolate
milk
is
what
lingers
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
unfortunately
a
little
flat
with
lower
carbonation
slight
oily
slickness
to
it
again
i
wish
this
felt
creamier
but
overall
its
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
that
excels
in
flavor
if
it
didnt
just
lack
on
the
looks
and
mouthfeel
department
it
would
be
perfect
othis
is
the
stout
that
took
me
by
a
mittened
hand
and
walked
with
me
over
the
docks
and
told
me
that
it
was
alright
to
love
stouts
ive
since
moved
on
to
others
but
i
always
come
back
when
winter
falls
a
sweet
lovable
dessertlike
beer
with
a
heart
of
gold
overall
well
not
quite
as
good
as
ipswichs
variety
but
close
very
smooth
drinkable
its
modest
abv
makes
it
a
perfect
session
stout
once
again
mayflowers
brewmaster
succeeds
a
triple
but
not
a
home
run
just
being
honest
o
great
oatmeal
stout
right
up
there
with
ipswich
which
is
my
measuring
stick
i
cant
wait
to
try
one
of
the
other
two
versions
that
included
a
specific
hops
variety

of

with

syrup
same
great
roasted
notes
in
the
flavor
roasted
coffee
and
a
hint
of
pine
hops
before
the
sweeter
side
of
the
beer
takes
over
smooth
milk
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
vanilla
give
it
a
silky
feel
not
the
smoothest
oatmeal
stout
but
still
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
go
along
with
the
great
flavor
sessionable
for
any
beer
nevermind
a
stout
i
really
like
this
beer
nice
and
smooth
texture
layered
flavors
little
boozy
at
the
end
but
a
great
brew
nonetheless
o
had
this
fresh
off
the
tap
in
thier
tasting
room
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
suprisingly
good
drinkability
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
will
pick
up
a
sixer
soon
o
normally
anything
with
hops
catches
my
attention
but
something
about
an
oatmeal
winter
stout
just
sounded
so
cozy
that
i
had
to
buy
it
a
nice
almost
desertlike
stout
that
can
border
on
too
sweet
but
manages
to
pull
it
off
o
a
good
oatmeal
stout
good
winter
seasonal
an
imperial
version
of
this
dark
brew
would
be
very
very
interesting
hint
hint
o
nice
traditional
oatmeal
stout
and
i
look
forward
to
more
from

opaque

bubbles
but
weak
retention
mostly
chocolate
aroma
with
a
english
or
irish
ale
yeast
mixed
in

good
pretty
intense
for
a
oatmeal
stout
great
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
flavors
bitterness
is
solid
mouthfeel
is
really
effected
by
the
dark
acidic
grains
i
do
really
like
the
beer
but
the
oatmeal
is
a
bit
lost
in
the
other
malts
6
abv
is
apparent
much
much
better
served
warmer
good
sixer
for
the
winter
o
i
enjoyed
this
stout
its
fairly
standard
and
easy
to
get
around
here
an
acceptable
stout
d
an
above
average
oatmeal
stout
that
could
very
easily
become
great
with
a
few
little
tweeks
the
appearance
needs
to
be
stronger
and
the
mouthfeel
more
substantial
other
than
that
im
satisfied
with
this
purchase
overall
decent
but
i
feel
like
it
could
be
better
i
hate
to
say
this
for
fear
of
being
a
typical
extreme
beer
nerd
but
id
like
this
beer
to
be
bigger
with
more
unfermentables
and
a
heavier
body
still
i
feel
like
the
brewery
was
going
for
a
more
sessionable
every
night
kind
of
stout
and
i
can
definitely
recommend
this
beer
for
that
purpose
overall
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
well
worthy
of
a
try
dark

a

touch
of

somewhat
thin
to
me
lacks
the

of
a

make
this

from

being
added
the

deep
with
notes

cocoa
almost
bittersweet
with
a
light
hoppiness
undercutting
the
deeply
roasted
malts
slight
peat
like
aroma
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavor
started
out
a
little
off
for
the
style
with
a
health
dose
of
smoked
and
roasted
malts
not
exactly
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
it
but
none
the
matter
it
was
still
very
good
rich
notes
of
cocoa
overlayed
with
a
hint
of
dark
bakers
chocolate
and
an
almost
molasses
like
flavor
swirling
around
in
there
as
well
the
finish
though
was
coated
with
licorice
like
flavors
and
very
wet
leaving
you
almost
drooling
waiting
for
another
sip
to
come
through
decent
feel
on
this
one
though
if
i
am
being
honest
towards
the
end
of
the
session
it
did
start
to
feel
a
little
bit
flat
on
me
but
maybe
it
was
me
still
though
more
then
decently
sessionable
and
i
would
have
no
issues
with
drinking
this
again
if
i
havent
lost
you
by
now
i
should
have
if
you
get
it
drink
it
as
its
decent
but
dont
trade
the
kids
in
for
it
unless
they
are
total
brats
and
driving
you
friggin
nuts
all
the
time
than
its
understandable
relatively
thin
for
the
style
otherwise
this
is
a
very
truetothestyle
irish
stout
dry
and
bitter
from
the
darker
malt
flavors
very
true
to
its
roots
overall
pretty
good
for
my
first
mayflower

were
some
issues
with
the

its

made
up

another

beer
way
more
interesting
than
your

how
smokyroasty
this
was
overall
a
nice
winter
heavy
beer
that
hides

abv
well
plus
very
impressed

far
with
the
mayflower
offerings
on

at

in

sq
this
past
saturday
night
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
minimal
head
lacing
really
only
at
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
was
very
nice
with
some
coffee
aroma
really
standing
out
flavor
was
quite
good
also
there
was
a
great
mix
of
wintery
spices
from
a
winter
warmer
that
mingled
nicely
with
the
hearty
flavors
of
a
stout
liked
the
combination
a
lot
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thinner
than
id
hoped
for
and
the
alcohol
was
a
tad
noticeable
a
beer
that
i
surely
enjoyed
but
its
not
a
beer
than
id
stay
with
all
night
but
its
one
of
my
favorite
new
winter
releases
of
2011
ddrinkable
could
be
a
little
richer
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
d
its
very
smooth
and
has
a
high
level
of
drinkablility
the
creamy
roasted
taste
makes
this
something
that
could
even
be
enjoyed
by
nonbeer
drinkers
hop
flavor
is
herbal
yet
woody
d
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
is
probably
the
best
mayflower
offering
ive
ever
tried
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
but
not
enjoyable
enough
to
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
watery
and
really
weak
when
it
comes
to
the
mouthfeel
the
aforementioned
lower
carbonation
levels
of
the
oatmeal
stout
give
this
beer
a
very
rich
and
creamy
presence
there
is
a
largely
appealing
smoothness
to
the
offering
that
is
enjoyable
and
makes
you
want
to
reach
for
this
beer
time
and
time
again
the
taste
is
very
nice
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
brewer
is
not
trying
to
jam
way
too
much
abv
into
a
beer
that
doesnt
warrant
it
the
beer
is
fairly
full
bodied
has
a
nice
smoked
oaky
and
molasses
character
the
oatmeal
comes
through
on
the
silkiness
on
the
tongue
but
it
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
expectation
in
that
there
is
too
much
foreground
with
the
slightly
burnt
flavors
and
not
enough
real
chocolate
and
dark
malt
qualities
where
they
should
belong
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
touch
of
spice
hidden
away
and
this
adds
some
complexity
the
aftertaste
carries
on
with
a
bit
too
much
cherryish
oaky
quality
and
it
just
lingers
a
bit
too
long
this
is
a
nice
beer
though
very
drinkable
for
sure
with
that
said
it
was
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
drinks
pretty
well
well
balanced
good
example
of
the
style
would
drink
again
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
tasty
stout
ill
deffinatly
try
this
again
d
i
would
definitely
drink

all
d
this
is
my
first
beer
from
the
brewery
and
it
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
to
say
the
least
very
well
balanced
nothing
crazy
but
a
nice
consistent
and
delicious
beer
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
challenges
ipswich
oatmeal
for
the
best
oatmeal
stout
in
new
england
and
i
love
ipswich
oatmeal
d
the
flavor
is
quite
good
and
definitely
makes
a
nice
winter
beer
very
drinkable
ill
take
an
ipswich
oatmeal
stout
before
this
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
as
well
mayflower
makes
some
pretty
solid
beers
but
some
of
their
seasonals
are
not
the
best
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
out
of
their
seasonals
i
still
would
take
their
ipa
and
porter
over
this
however
overall
pretty
good
d
easy
to
put
down
very
tasty
a
great
beer
must
be
warm
and
casked
easy
drinking
here
shared
a
6
and
everyone
loved
it
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
from
mayflower
always
looking
forward
to
new
stuff
from
the
people
at
mayflower
this
oatmeal
stout
pours
out
a
dark
brownalmost
black
with
ruby
hues
on
the
side
not
much
more
than
a
small
amount
of
lacing
serves
as
the
head
though
it
is
much
darker
than
i
was
expecting
notes
of
char
and
smoke
begin
the
smell
followed
by
some
dark
fruit
metal
and
cocoa
bitter
coffee
chocolate
smoke
and
charred
grain
are
at
the
center
of
the
flavor
profile
which
is
complex
but
not
overkill
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
for
this
style
but
it
adds
to
the
drinkability
in
a
big
way
this
is
definitely
a
dark
beer
that
is
not
a
meal
in
a
bottle
and
is
sessionable
too
this
is
some
good
stuff
here
from
mayflower
it
nails
the
english
smells
and
flavors
found
in
the
real
thing
cheers
notes
quite
the
tasty
brew
a
good
one
to
pick
up
for
any
oatmeal
stout
enthusist
cheers
o
this
beer
has
an
excellent
nose
but
the
taste
is
subtle
and
tame
in
comparison
it
did
not
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
but
it
should
be
noted
that
my
expectations
were
extremely
high
having
thoroughly
enjoyed
mayflower
porter
and
a
few
of
their
other
beers
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
from
mayflower
and
worth
a
try
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
on
this
one
but
after
a
couple
it
seems
like
its
on
the
lower
end
light
enough
to
have
a
few
but
just
heavy
enough
to
prevent
more
than
than
that
the
flavors
are
interesting
enough
to
make
you
want
to
try
a
second
but
you
might
be
ready
to
move
on
after
that
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
beautiful
frothy
light
brown
head
that
goes
absolutely
nowhere
smells
of
milk
chocolate
some
roastiness
lactose
smells
like
sweet
roasty
milk
chocolate
taste
is
more
milk
chocolatey
goodness
this
reminds
me
of
a
great
milksweet
stout
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
rolls
around
in
your
mouth
almost
airy
very
drinkable
another
great
job
by
mayflower
i
love
trying
their
beers
drinkability
is
pretty
good
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
booze
and
its
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
and
fairly
dry
but
does
coat
the
mouth
a
bit
leaving
a
long
lasting
residue
of
the
beer
drinkability
a
very
good
offering
from
mayflower
i
could
sit
with
a
couple
of
these
in
the
winter
they
balance
the
oat
and
nut
flavors
just
right
d
goes
down
easily
quite
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
see
on
this
is
a
bit
thicker
body
otherwise
completely
a
beer
to
sit
with
for
the
evening
very
dark
no
apparent
edges
there
was
a
shortlived
cap
of
brown
bubbles
but
it
disappeared
quickly
leaving
only
a
meager
collar
nice
aroma
plenty
of
roast
with
chocolate
and
nutty
notes
caramel
and
toffee
slight
charcoal
with
a
hint
of
licorice
bitterness
was
prominent
throughout
perhaps
a
bit
higher
than
needed
to
balance
the
sweetness
roast
caramel
cocoa
and
flash
of
grassy
hops
towards
the
end
a
little
spicy
in
the
finish
with
lingering
sweetness
medium
plus
bodied
with
a
slightly
silky
texture
but
the
mouthfeel
suffered
due
to
the
coarseness
of
the
carbonation
not
sure
what
happened
there
but
is
just
didnt
have
the
smoothness
i
associate
with
the
use
of
oats
even
with
that
it
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
better
head
retention
and
lower
carbonation
would
improve
this
one
a
lot
excellent
oatmeal
stout
i
will
get
this
again
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
although
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
true
oatmeal
stout
its
still
dangerously
drinkable
and
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
to
compain
about
the
flavors
are
there
and
the
deliciousness
is
definitely
there
o
this
is
up
there
with
my
favorite
stouts
pours
rich
and
thick
like
a
stout
should
very
dark
appearance
with
less
than
expected
head
rich
smooth
taste
with
just
the
right
carbonation
an
extremely
delicious
stout
the
flavor
is
a
bit
subdued
but
smooth
and
delicious
theres
a
ribbon
of
sweetness
that
tastes
like
marshmallow
cream
caramel
and
toffee
the
stout
like
characteristics
then
shine
through
with
roast
char
chocolate
malt
and
graham
cracker
all
the
while
i
tastes
tinges
of
molasses
and
dark
fruit
supposedly
this
was
just
5
for
a
bomber
it
was
given
to
me
if
thats
the
case
this
may
be
the
best
deal
in
craft
beer
nice
mouthfeel
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
very
good
toasted
marshmallow
on
the
nose
coffee
and
cocoa
on
the
palate
this
beer
delivers
pours
thick
rick
and
midnight
black
the
alcohol
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
full
flavor
and
sweet
malts
with
just
a
twinge
if
bitterness
reminding
you
to
keep
drinking
smooth
and
wet
this
one
makes
a
great
case
for
the
oatmeal
stouts
tasted
like
a
black
ipa
o
disappointing
especially
given
the
high
ratings
on
ba
the
discrepancy
along
with
an
overly
aggressive
frothy
head
and
offnotes
make
me
suspect
i
got
a
bad
bottle
solid
stout
but
did
not
standout
among
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
phenomenal
oatmeal
stout
smell
and
taste
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
very
subtle
oatmeal
background
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
is
also
very
hearty
great
local
beer
this
is
a
solid
stout
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
dont
sit
on
this
on
for
long
its
kinda
on
the
low
side
in
the
abv
department
o
a
truly
phenomenal
brew
for
the
style
maybe
it
loses
some
fraction
of
a
point
for
having
more
chocolate
flavor
than
oatmeal
but
either
way
this
is
a
great
beer
absolutely
incredible
o
a
bit
watery
but
still
outstanding
not
heavy
an
early
fall
type
of
stout
will
revisit
soon
o
a
very
good
stout
though
less
sweet
than
an
oatmeal
might
be
gives
the
impression
of
being
a
modern
american
oatmeal
stout
due
to
the
relative
bitterness
a
bit
surprising
from
ipswichmercury
which
i
think
of
as
leaning
towards
british
styles
pours
opaque
with
a
one
finger
head
and
a
light
lacing
this
beer
smells
great
it
has
a
coffee
aroma
with
subtle
oatmeal
notes
smooth
is
an
understatement
this
beer
goes
down
like
a
glass
of
milk
outstanding
flavor
complex
but
not
overbearing
its
flavor
resembles
that
of
a
chocolate
shake
this
is
possibly
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
try
this
beer
love
the
look
of
this
beer
a
gorgeous
soft
bubbly
light
but
not
too
light
brown
sits
atop
the
black
brew
some
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
the
nose
brings
milk
chocolate
roasted
coffee
nuts
oats
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
doesnt
bring
as
much
of
the
smell
to
the
table
you
get
hints
of
cocoa
and
coffee
and
roasted
malts
each
sip
goes
down
smooth
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
sticky
on
the
lips
too
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
can
see
why
it
is
considered
a
classic
in
the
area
o
a
classic
for
a
reason
what
a
satisfying
drinkable
beer
the
callandresponse
between
the
creamy
sugars
and
the
bitter
hops
and
roasts
makes
this
interesting
enough
to
stay
satisfying
throughout
and
that
doesnt
seem
too
typical
in
a
lowalcohol
beer
i
thought
that
there
would
be
some
noticeably
dull
flavors
in
here
due
to
the
age
of
this
bottleturns
out
thats
not
at
all
true
great
beer
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
for
a
nonimperial
stout
one
of
my
favorites
10
for
a
six
pack
in
ma
its
a
great
value
will
become
part
of
the
normal
rotation
overall
nice
oatmeal
stout
would
like
a
little
less
bitterness
serving
type
bottle
o
very
good
a
good
counterpoint
to
the
overly
sweet
examples
of
the
style
o
great
taste
and
feel
and
balance
and
complexity
great
stout
with
good
linger
overall
a
balance
of
flavors
in
this
classic
oatmeal
stout
enjoyed
a
lot
over
the
years
surprised
i
havent
reviewed
it
yet
rjt
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
that
the
oatiness
was
not
as
prevalent
as
i
would
have
liked
would
definitely
have
again
overall
4
0
excellent
oatmeal
stout
big
flavors
relatively
big
abv
7
and
big
hype
but
this
baby
lives
up
to
all
of
it
pleasant
and
warming
this
would
be
an
ideal
beer
for
a
night
in
front
of
the
fireplace
in
the
winter
i
am
drinking
this
in
july
but
am
married
so
i
have
an
active
imagination
regardless
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
you
should
try
out
this
beer
it
is
light
smooth
and
wellbalanced
not
an
imperial
stout
by
any
means
it
is
basic
and
well
worth
your
hardearned
sheckles
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
fair
head
but
no
real
lacing
char
roasted
grains
chocolate
and
oatmeal
make
up
the
nose
tastes
like
it
smells
charred
malt
grains
bittersweet
chocolate
and
oatmeal
simple
but
well
done
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
its
up
there
among
the
best
stouts
ive
had
wouldnt
mind
seeing
it
in
six
packs
instead
of
the
22
oz
bottle
ah
yes
it
was
a
rather
cold
and
bitter
rainy
day
today
so
i
thought
id
indulge
in
some
blood
warming
beer
and
ipswich
oatmeal
stout
was
the
right
place
to
start
upon
moving
your
nose
toward
the
glass
an
aroma
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
surround
it
strongly
and
you
dont
need
to
smell
it
twice
to
know
what
this
beer
consists
of
though
its
really
damn
pleasant
so
you
might
want
to
the
taste
brings
on
a
bitterness
thats
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
beans
but
the
addition
of
oats
gives
this
beer
a
balanced
sweetness
and
a
consistent
velvety
texture
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
alone
or
maybe
with
some
dessert
after
dinner
overall
really
well
puttogether
oatmeal
stout
that
has
the
flavour
that
i
really
enjoy
in
any
sort
of
beer
especially
considering
its
a
yearround
and
reasonably
priced
its
too
bad
i
dont
live
in
the
new
england
distribution
zone
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
ill
keep
it
in
mind
the
next
time
i
go
out
and
visit
in
boston

overall
this
is
a
nice

a
huge
emphasis
on
the

this
is
a
nice

i
get
some
of
that
oatmeal
flavor
as
well
there
is
some
roastiness
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
light

the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
and
the
oatmeal
helps
smooth
the

this
is
an
excellent

overall
a
big
beer
hiding
in
a

oatmeal
rich
complex

mellow
and
drinkable
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
o
i
like
this
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
after
a
sip
it
leaves
you
wanting
another
the
taste
is
so
complex
and
maybe
it
is
the
ibus
which
i
dont
know
that
make
it
hard
too
gulp
it
or
drink
it
any
other
way
than
a
sip
and
a
sip
and
another
sip
delicious
and
i
would
recommend
it
o
better
than
the
best
oatmeal
if
you
ask
me
and
i
am
an
oatmeal
lover
i
wonder
if
this
was
brewed
with
apple
cinnamon
because
it
is
most
definitely
a
real
oatmeal
in
this
tasty
pick
overall
probably
my
new
standard
for
oatmeal
stouts
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
look
for
more
bottles
this
one
fires
on
all
cylinders
o
this
is
the
bottle
i
would
hand
to
a
neophyte
beerappreciating
friend
to
introduce
them
to
quality
americanborn
stouts
overall
a
well
rounded
rich
an
balanced
stout
recommendable
o
this
has
the
makings
of
a
imperial
stout
in
flavor
and
body
its
rich
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
in
your
face
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
gets
smoother
as
it
warms
up
flavors
meld
much
better
an
absolute
steal
at
the
price
ipswich
rules
overall
being
a
really
common
beer
from
the
area
that
doesnt
have
any
sort
of
cult
following
i
was
surprised
at
how
easy
drinking
yet
perfectly
balanced
yet
somewhat
unique
this
beer
is
mimicking
the
aroma
exactly
with
slightly
more
coffee
roast
ipswich
delivers
on
flavor
i
just
want
to
eat
this
beer
almost
chewy
in
texture
with
light
carbonation
and
a
beautiful
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
this
oatmeal
stout
becomes
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
sure
to
go
well
with
cheesecake
a
la
mode
o
excellent
flavorful
oatmeal
stout
ipswich
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
at
10
bucks
a
sixer
it
might
be
one
of
the
most
affordable
top
notch
stouts
money
can
buy
o
this
along
with
breckenridge
is
widely
available
at
my
local
liquor
store
down
the
street
i
love
breckenridge
much
better
than
this
but
that
doesnt
discredit
the
beer
at
all
it
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
and
very
much
appreciated
for
those
who
live
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
another
beer
well
done
massachusetts
do
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
be
happy
really
dig
the
coffee
undertones
at
the
end
of
each
sip
an
undertheradar
brew
for
sure
mouthfeel
all
of
medium
bodied
probably
a
little
full
than
that
even
nice
low
carbonation
and
very
smooth
overall
i
was
honestly
extremely
impressed
with
this
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
if
not
the
best
o
this
is
a
great
local
stout
the
flavor
is
very
nice
it
finish
very
smooth
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
price
is
absolutely
unbeatable
10
for
a
6pack
i
definitely
recommend
picking
some
up
a
beer
that
ive
tried
multiple
times
and
definitely
will
pick
up
again
overall
this
is
a
totally
smackable
beer
i
will
need
to
seek
this
out
again
at
total
wine
basically
if
youre
a
fan
of
good
gourmet
dark
roast
coffee
as
i
am
you
will
be
a
fan
of
this
one
o
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
unfortunately
its
on
the
abv
high
end
which
cuts
down
on
drinkability
o
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
maybe
second
only
to
sam
smiths
which
is
divine
its
got
nice
sharp
roasted
malt
qualities
with
the
creaminess
and
added
complexity
of
the
oatmeal
a
musthave
for
fans
of
the
style
d
it
is
nice
i
dont
think
it
stands
out
against
other
oatmeal
stouts
though
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
o
not
a
bad
beer
it
has
its
flaws
but
id
say
they
are
in
the
eye
of
the
drinker
in
this
case
knowing
what
im
getting
into
with
this
one
now
with
the
large
hop
character
and
the
dry
mouthfeel
i
could
find
myself
in
the
mood
for
it
and
would
buy
it
again
mouthfeel
is
good
a
little
too
tangyacidic
maybe
but
not
a
fatal
flaw
full
body
with
light
carbonation
and
a
little
oily
excellent
beer
being
from
ohio
i
have
to
say
i
like
b
o
r
i
s
better
but
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
black
with
some
tannish
foam
initial
nose
comes
through
with
good
strong
oats
and
tootsie
rolls
graham
and
some
nice
nice
cocoa
nice
nose
slightly
dry
coffee
toned
grainy
oaty
flavor
up
front
with
some
nice
bitterness
on
the
back
end
nice
malt
character
on
this
beer
so
far
soo
good
on
this
one
thick
and
smooth
with
a
lighter
carb
and
semi
dry
character
nice
beer
really
nice
surprise
smoothish
and
slightly
drying
medium
body
and
light
effervescence
would
like
more
body
but
a
fine
brew
regardless
cost
12
99
for
a
six
pack
truly
an
impressive
beer
22oz
bottle
pours
a
black
dark
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
dark
brown
head
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
espresso
vanilla
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
earth
flavors
of
vanilla
espresso
and
roasted
malts
sweet
but
not
overkill
bittersweet
coffee
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
amount
of
roasted
malt
and
smoky
flavor
to
go
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
burn
really
good
oatmeal
stout
worth
having
again
for
certain
really
nice
brew
worth
a
try
for
sure
black
like
oi
with
a
nice
thick
mocha
head
a
big
rich
and
roasty
aroma
of
barley
coffee
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
matches
the
aroma
quite
well
with
with
the
addition
of
a
nice
hoppy
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
freakin
awesome
oatmeal
stout
very
very
bold
for
the
style
imo
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
maybe
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
this
is
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
is
so
damn
good
ipswich
makes
a
very
smooth
product
and
it
shows
here
its
velvety
and
slick
really
nice
just
great
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
just
cant
get
over
the
sourmilk
like
flavor
which
dominates
it
overall
the
price
tag
was
left
on
and
at
3
99
a
bomber
holy
cow
a
fantastic
beer
for
that
price
im
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
value
for
a
beer
overall
its
fine
wouldve
preferred
a
skosh
less
in
the
ibu
department
and
just
a
bit
more
silkiness
in
the
mouthfeel
still
its
fine
fine
fine
o
definitley
getting
more
of
this
ill
be
goiung
to
this
once
i
get
sick
of
hops
for
a
while
awesome
beer
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
few
6packs
of
this
winter
local
availability
and
price
even
when
not
on
sale
make
this
a
goto
oatmeal
stout
for
me
overall
the
touch
of
chocolate
does
help
to
even
out
this
brew
and
makes
it
more
fitting
to
the
style
i
do
prefer
this
style
to
be
less
carbonated
and
slightly
thicker
than
this
brew
overall
rating
of
fitting
to
the
style
would
be
average
in
my
book
not
bad
definetly
worth
getting
again
o
really
enjoyable
stout
looks
smells
and
tastes
very
good
pick
some
up
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
great
deal
tastes
great
great
representation
of
the
style
very
interesting
in
taste
the
thick
heavy
chocolate
malts
are
like
a
brick
concrete
and
immovable
with
coffee
molasses
and
chocolate
yet
halfway
through
the
hops
kick
in
this
is
unexpected
medicinal
and
floral
in
nature
they
teleport
this
beer
especially
the
finish
and
aftertaste
to
a
different
place
before
this
i
enjoyed
a
very
good
black
ipa
and
im
having
a
little
deja
vu
certainly
this
is
smooth
and
tasty
and
very
well
handcrafted
but
im
slightly
resenting
the
hop
takeover
as
to
me
thats
not
what
oatmeal
stout
is
about
so
to
speak
overall
liked
it
a
lot
holds
strong
with
stand
up
qualities
poured
a
18
deep
mocha
head
the
body
looks
dark
as
coffee
smell
has
lots
of
coffee
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
taste
mirrors
and
even
exceeds
the
smell
theres
a
deep
richness
and
a
medium
weight
perhaps
a
little
overroasting
but
it
contributes
to
the
flavors
this
far
exceeded
my
expectations
in
fact
this
degree
of
flavor
intensity
usually
comes
from
an
imperial
stout
which
its
obviously
not
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
that
stands
out
there
are
a
handful
of
other
ones
id
rather
grab
but
its
still
worth
trying
o
overall
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
the
body
is
almost
perfect
a
very
nice
option
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
style
ive
had
in
a
while
o
this
was
a
really
solid
oatmeal
stout
i
liked
it
better
than
the
mendocino
strong
smoky
aroma
has
tones
of
chocolate
and
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
roast
coffee
it
pours
a
rich
opaque
coffee
brown
with
a
very
thick
mostly
finebubbled
rather
persistent
tan
head
flavor
has
a
firm
burnt
wood
overtone
and
caramel
semisweet
chocolate
and
roast
coffee
notes
plus
just
a
hint
of
licorice
texture
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
but
still
has
a
good
fizz
to
it
and
leaves
a
smoky
slightly
sweet
finish
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
ipswich
offerings
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
an
inch
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
and
strong
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
oats
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
its
all
roasted
malt
oats
coffee
chocolate
and
vanilla
theres
good
balance
between
the
roasty
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
creamy
and
coating
with
good
carbonation
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
its
one
of
if
not
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
ever
had
its
an
excellent
deal
for
just
5
99
a
bomber
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
still
solid
enjoy
overall
a
very
good
beer
except
for
the
overly
astringent
and
almost
plastic
tasting
beginning
i
dont
know
if
it
is
super
roasted
and
supposed
to
be
that
way
or
if
there
was
a
problem
somewhere
if
this
beer
didnt
have
such
a
bad
beginning
it
would
be
amazing
ill
have
to
try
it
again
and
hope
for
better
results
d
i
picked
this
up
without
knowing
much
at
all
about
this
beer
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
brewed
to
a
slightly
stronger
strength
than
i
would
have
expected
but
that
7
abv
stays
well
hidden
thus
its
a
dangerous
one
o
this
is
an
excellent
show
of
the
style
great
flavor
and
silky
body
really
fills
you
up
like
it
should
a
little
heavier
taste
would
improve
it
though
the
smell
is
excellent
as
well
this
is
now
in
competition
with
samuel
smiths
depending
on
whether
i
want
a
little
bitterness
or
not
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
out
o
im
incredibly
impressed
by
this
i
bought
this
as
a
part
of
a
mix
six
and
it
sat
in
my
fridge
for
about
5
months
before
i
rediscovered
it
the
flavor
combination
really
impressed
me
great
coffee
and
chocolate
overall
a
good
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
a
nice
one
to
buy
occasionally
to
mix
into
the
rotation
o
overall
the
smell
and
the
mouthfel
were
both
great
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
notes
this
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
on
the
market
easily
the
most
fairly
priced
too
big
aromas
of
roast
chocolate
and
fresh
ground
coffee
beans
with
a
spike
of
hoppiness
smells
like
a
recipe
for
success
and
indeed
it
is
exceedingly
thick
and
velvety
body
makes
for
an
awesome
feel
toasty
roast
burnt
and
chocolate
flavors
weve
got
all
the
required
stout
malt
bases
covered
here
as
it
warms
bitterness
and
a
citric
hop
undercurrent
become
more
and
more
assertive
both
bitter
and
chocolatey
in
the
swallow
a
satisfying
finish
to
a
great
beer
my
favorite
brew
from
a
recent
trip
to
the
boston
area
highly
recommended
been
walking
past
this
guy
too
many
times
at
the
store
time
to
take
him
home
he
pours
a
straight
onyx
topped
by
a
finger
of
sienna
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
syrup
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
powder
molasses
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
bean
the
taste
holds
notes
of
darklyroasted
malts
very
bitter
dark
chocolate
the
kind
youd
bake
with
rather
than
eat
straightup
vinyl
anise
rubbing
alcohol
charcoal
and
molasses
yowza
this
stuff
is
acridly
bitter
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
nearly
chewy
feel
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
what
would
have
been
a
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
suffers
from
an
excess
of
bitterness
and
plasticness
in
the
taste
my
advice
keep
walkin
on
by
this
guy
o
pretty
good
stout
right
here
very
drinkible
considering
its
thickness
alcohol
is
masked
by
the
coffee
taste
would
definitely
try
again
drinkability
a
flavorful
and
enjoyable
drink
that
doesnt
seem
to
match
with
its
name
while
i
enjoyed
this
and
actually
had
a
6
pack
it
seems
more
akin
to
a
dry
irish
stout
to
me
so
receives
a
little
down
tick
overall
great
oatmeal
stout
and
a
fantastic
price
point
at
a
5
dollar
bomber
i
expected
a
thicker
beer
than
what
it
was
that
was
my
only
negative
thought
on
this
beer
a
beer
on
my
wants
list
for
awhile
all
of
the
sudden
popped
up
in
my
local
store
how
about
that
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
looks
black
when
viewed
in
the
snifter
the
darker
tan
foam
on
the
surface
is
a
good
indicator
that
its
got
some
dark
malts
in
store
the
smell
is
rather
muted
but
still
quite
pleasant
i
detected
most
prominently
aromas
of
coffee
charcoal
oatmeal
and
vanilla
the
flavor
resembles
many
of
the
characteristics
with
adding
in
some
complexities
such
as
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
the
oats
helped
with
the
creaminess
of
the
mouthfeel
but
not
to
the
point
where
i
really
would
have
enjoyed
that
part
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
nothing
special
but
i
could
find
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
o
very
good
representation
of
the
style
but
just
a
little
overcarbonated
this
one
might
want
to
sit
for
a
while
in
the
fridge
before
drinking
overall
one
of
the
better
standard
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
this
one
was
spot
on
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
thinner
bodied
than
expected
and
surprisingly
very
hop
forward
with
some
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
roasted
malt
into
a
lingering
dry
finish
pretty
roasty
with
sme
rich
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
hints
of
caramel
lots
of
oatmeal
toffee
and
burnt
toast
slightly
bunt
tasting
and
a
bitthin
for
my
liking
but
not
bad
truly
world
class
imo
and
after
all
these
years
still
satisfying
to
a
jaded
beer
geek
that
is
hard
to
please
its
a
shame
that
not
all
beer
stores
recognize
this
as
one
of
new
englands
best
and
would
rather
attempt
to
sell
some
other
stout
from
far
away
instead
o
really
like
this
beer
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
extremely
affordable
in
massachusetts
as
well
will
have
to
grab
some
more
next
time
i
am
up
there
the
cpj
i
had
a
growler
of
this
early
in
my
beerdrinking
life
at
the
time
i
thought
it
was
too
bitter
and
burnt
i
guess
it
is
a
good
thing
that
i
am
now
making
the
same
observations
four
years
later
this
would
be
a
winner
in
my
book
if
it
werent
so
heavily
charred
the
mouth
feel
is
rich
but
still
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
like
from
a
stout
the
oatmeal
helps
to
round
out
the
body
of
the
beer
so
there
isnt
too
sharp
a
bight
from
the
carbonation
over
all
my
favorite
stout
hits
all
the
right
characteristics
i
look
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
appearance
is
a
deep
mahognay
with
a
tan
cap
that
left
nice
lae
smells
of
oats
coffee
dark
chocalte
slighlty
bitter
and
alcoholic
very
crinkable
with
less
sweetness
than
most
oatmeals
stouts
i
have
had
really
good
beer
pours
a
very
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzycreamy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
very
malty
with
lots
of
chocolatetoffeecaramel
the
taste
is
very
nice
sweet
malty
very
nice
touch
of
dark
stuff
and
some
vanilla
notes
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
tasty
brew
which
we
had
something
like
this
here
in
utah
pours
a
nice
jet
black
body
modest
one
finger
head
brown
in
color
nice
big
ring
of
lacing
remains
typical
porter
smells
with
this
one
sweet
dark
chocolate
some
caramel
maybe
bubble
gum
tastes
like
a
stout
sweet
carmel
toffee
roasted
barley
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
lingering
bubble
gummy
roasty
bitterness
some
tobacco
some
where
in
there
too
creamy
medium
full
bodied
low
carbing
i
like
this
one
and
could
easily
have
a
few
more
1
80
a
single
overall
super
enjoyable
i
love
this
one
smells
and
tastes
almost
like
a
imperial
coffee
stout
but
drinks
much
easier
grab
this
excellent
drinkability
for
a
beer
of
the
style
and
abv
definitely
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
a
couple
pints
arent
out
of
the
question
and
one
will
probably
make
you
want
two
d
one
glass
begs
for
another
so
many
flavors
to
examine
best
oatmeal
stout
around
i
reviewed
the
bottle
version
few
months
ago
everything
i
said
there
applies
here
plus
it
gets
a
higher
rating
because
its
even
better
on
cask
served
at
something
below
room
temperature
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
intensified
youll
find
enough
dried
fruit
in
here
to
solve
any
constipation
problem
plus
theres
enough
coffee
to
satisfy
everything
youll
need
in
the
morning
the
color
is
blackhole
black
the
body
is
dense
and
heavy
the
complexities
are
deep
and
wide
among
the
finest
winter
brews
ive
had
in
a
long
time
d
drinkability
is
low
the
first
few
sips
were
enjoyable
but
as
the
beer
drinks
the
bitterness
just
compounds
on
itself
and
its
a
bit
of
a
bitter
pill
to
swallow
underated
so
happy
i
tried
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
borders
on
black
with
a
good
tan
head
head
lasts
for
quite
some
time
and
leaves
behind
really
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
really
quite
nice
with
roasted
malt
toasted
oats
coffee
and
a
good
dose
of
chocolate
the
taste
carries
the
same
components
but
they
dont
meld
and
pop
as
much
as
in
the
flavor
really
nice
body
creamy
and
delicious
i
love
getting
extras
like
thisa
brewery
i
had
never
heard
of
before
this
that
brings
a
really
solid
offering
to
my
glass
overall
while
a
stout
man
ive
not
been
turned
on
much
by
many
stouts
including
oatmeal
stouts
this
was
and
is
everything
one
should
be
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
at
least
kinda
lacks
the
smooth
creamy
feel
id
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
not
really
seeing
the
oatmeal
at
all
drinkability
this
is
good
for
about
one
to
two
bottles
per
session
too
thick
and
high
of
alcohol
content
to
be
a
session
beer
drinks
wonderfully
not
the
most
attractive
stout
and
it
lacks
a
bit
of
body
but
its
absolutely
delicious
i
cannot
believe
i
havent
tried
this
one
before
im
sure
i
will
try
it
again
soon
reminds
me
of
great
lakes
edmund
fitzgerald
porter
but
a
bit
more
charred
well
done
drinkability
is
good
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
day
or
for
that
matter
any
day
actually
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
thats
worth
a
pint
or
two
or
more
very
well
done
i
really
like
this
beerflavorful
and
smooth
d
very
nice
malt
profile
throwing
everything
from
smooth
oats
to
hearty
charred
malts
into
the
mix
with
spicy
herbal
and
citrusy
hops
made
this
stout
a
treat
the
7
abv
has
warming
qualities
all
its
own
but
drinks
much
smaller
re
dangerous
stout
would
definitely
reccommend
and
buy
again
overall
this
is
quite
nice
and
were
it
local
something
id
keep
around
more
often
some
light
tweaks
i
think
could
finish
off
what
is
initially
a
velvety
smooth
pour
and
give
it
an
improved
head
d
excellent
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
well
worth
a
try
d
simply
put
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
huge
flavor
pretty
big
abv
as
well
d
drinkable
but
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
could
be
too
much
if
youre
not
careful
id
buy
again
if
i
was
in
new
england
d
not
too
bad
cheers
great
deep
black
coloring
to
this
oatmeal
stout
more
dark
chocolate
than
oatmeal
flavor
shines
through
heavy
and
bold
flavor
but
smooth
and
surprisingly
drinkable
sweet
and
roasted
notes
compete
and
the
beer
which
finishes
a
tad
bitter
but
very
enjoyable
ink
black
with
a
slight
creamy
head
smells
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
so
rich
it
is
indulgence
if
price
point
is
of
interest
at
7
99
a
6
pack
this
beer
is
a
walk
away
winner
thank
you
ipswich
for
crafting
a
winner
i
can
actually
afford
to
drink
regularly
im
getting
spoiled
d
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
at
7
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
must
say
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
the
color
on
this
is
amazing
looks
almost
purple
littleno
foam
some
tiny
bubble
persist
around
the
edge
of
the
pint
glass
thick
rich
reminds
me
of
a
few
of
the
brown
ales
i
have
had
recently
but
more
potent
as
it
should
be
strong
tasting
hints
of
mochacoffee
present
taste
registers
strong
from
beginning
to
end
stays
with
you
a
little
after
but
not
too
much
at
all
my
favorite
ipswich
ale
i
have
had
to
date
solid
ill
be
back
for
more
definitely
worth
it
this
is
a
great
stout
i
need
to
find
a
case
of
this
unfortunately
i
bought
a
mixed
case
and
there
are
a
total
of
4
of
these
wtf
d
i
wasnt
as
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
hoped
to
be
a
nice
looking
and
smelling
beer
but
the
flavor
fell
a
bit
short
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
there
are
many
better
oatmeal
breakfast
brews
than
this
not
worth
hunting
down
d
i
wouldnt
want
to
face
this
beer
in
the
ring
it
would
kick
my
ass
i
have
sparred
with
some
pretty
fierce
dudes
none
of
them
have
been
as
intimidating
as
this
monster
regardless
i
love
it
this
is
a
badass
stout
drinkability
worth
a
try
but
i
think
there
are
better
examples
in
the
style
i
like
the
chewiness
but
the
flavor
is
not
as
full
as
others
i
have
had
still
for
the
price
it
is
well
worth
having
another
finishes
with
a
clean
aftertaste
that
lingers
with
a
hint
of
strong
dark
coffee
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
body
but
the
carbonation
keeps
it
from
feeling
too
slick
another
excellent
style
from
the
mercury
brewing
company
loaded
with
body
and
flavor
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
as
far
as
oatmeal
stouts
go
never
felt
overbearing
or
too
thick
for
the
flavor
profile
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
definitely
well
made
and
approachable
for
its
interesting
7
abv
it
also
worked
well
in
a
batch
of
beer
brownies
ink
black
with
thick
and
creamy
light
brown
head
lots
of
lace
smells
strongly
like
a
mix
of
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
with
a
roasted
malt
twang
floral
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
does
the
aroma
justice
with
the
roasted
malt
coming
through
in
a
big
way
and
balanced
by
sweetness
bitter
smokey
finish
the
flavor
is
phenomenal
and
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
without
coming
close
to
wanting
something
else
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
february
19
2010
the
pour
is
nearly
black
with
about
threequarters
frothy
head
that
stays
around
for
the
entire
time
the
aroma
is
overwhelmed
by
chocolate
and
coffee
with
the
oatmeal
a
bit
of
bread
or
biscuits
balancing
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
heavy
the
taste
is
very
nice
although
not
quite
as
powerful
as
the
aroma
lead
you
to
believe
it
is
full
of
coffee
grinds
chocolate
and
a
pleasing
background
of
hops
overall
this
is
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
out
jet
black
with
almost
no
highlights
to
it
slight
light
highlights
on
the
side
but
it
really
pours
out
dark
thick
and
rich
looking
it
had
a
big
dark
tanned
colored
head
to
it
that
sticks
around
for
several
minutes
and
produces
some
decent
lacing
to
it
its
a
hearty
rich
looking
beer
after
smelling
it
it
could
get
away
with
being
called
a
coffee
stout
the
more
i
smelled
it
i
realized
its
a
very
generously
hopped
beer
especially
for
a
stout
there
are
no
doubt
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
to
this
beer
but
the
hops
are
probably
the
most
dominant
feature
the
taste
doesnt
mess
around
it
has
a
flavor
along
the
lines
of
an
imperial
stout
i
guess
this
beer
is
having
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
here
again
very
strong
traces
of
coffee
chocolate
burned
malts
grains
and
oats
compliment
the
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
and
has
a
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
certainly
could
be
better
i
think
this
is
where
all
the
flavors
caught
up
with
itself
and
all
that
was
going
on
just
kind
of
complicated
the
mouthfeel
it
could
have
been
a
little
smoother
to
help
balance
out
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
the
drinkability
is
still
pretty
top
notch
all
in
all
this
is
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
i
remember
this
is
one
of
the
first
oatmeal
stouts
i
ever
had
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beer
i
didnt
remember
it
that
well
but
remembered
liking
it
i
think
my
tastes
have
changed
over
the
years
but
its
good
to
know
i
appreciated
good
beer
back
then
as
well
its
a
high
quality
brew
go
out
and
get
some
the
taste
is
ash
skim
milk
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
hints
of
caramel
it
may
be
a
little
too
light
bodied
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
really
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
is
somewhat
tasty
not
a
standout
but
worth
trying
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
a
lingering
chocolatey
feeling
finish
the
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
a
two
and
done
stout
at
the
most
im
impressed
with
this
beer
and
the
price
8

makes
it
a
great
value
this
might
be
the
best

and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
very
nice
i
could
definately
have
more
than
one
of
these
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
can
imagine
myself
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
with
this
one
on
a
cold
winter

with

and

dark
chocolate
lovers
will
dig
this
one
highly
recommend
this
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
sure
on
a
nice
chilly
weekend
like
this
past
one
this
was
the
perfect
beer
to
be
sipping
on
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
to
it
tons
of
lacing
smell
is
of
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
super
super
creamy
and
just
full
of
flavor
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
some
dark
fruit
flavor
and
even
some
smokiness
flavor
all
mixed
together
superior
drinkability
for
its
7
abv
just
all
around
a
great
beer
and
the
whole
ipswich
mixed
12
pack
for
only
14
99
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
12
packs
out
there
give
it
a
try
drinkability
excellent
beer
this
ones
a
slow
sipper
with
a
complex
and
well
crafted
smell
and
flavor
big
fan
rich
dark
smooth
like
a
flannel
quilt
in
your
mouth
huge
head
of
creamy
color
at
room
temperature
pour
into
a
pint
glass
classic
stout
in
appearance
not
highly
flavored
but
deeply
layered
too
many
gave
me
a
killer
morning
after
headache
but
that
was
an
error
on
my
part
not
the
brewers
part
definitely
not
a
session
beer
the
taste
lingers
as
a
bit
tart
and
dry
but
somwhat
watereddown
balance
somewhat
creamy
initially
but
fades
away
to
nothing
overall
impression
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
certainly
have
it
again
however
i
found
it
a
bit
too
sweet
and
would
definitely
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
overall
not
bad
but
not
the
best
the
bitterness
gets
a
bit
astringent
and
over
bitter
with
both
spicy
earthy
hops
and
the
acrid
roasted
malt
going
overboard
a
bit
chewy
lots
of
oats
nice
chocolate
cocoa
but
a
bit
powdered
little
too
roasty
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
pays
dividends
for
swishing
swirling
and
experimenting
on
the
tongue
it
opens
up
easily
revealing
a
fairly
complex
rounded
motley
collection
of
brewing
highlights
on
the
top
of
my
mouth
i
feel
a
warming
mix
of
bitter
coffee
oats
and
dark
dry
cocoa
the
bitter
cocoa
highlights
hang
around
and
slide
towards
the
throat
as
a
warming
bitter
and
earthy
hoppiness
takes
hold
in
the
finish
my
sweet
tooth
is
asking
for
a
more
rounded
sweetness
in
the
middle
finishes
a
little
thin
yet
filmy
which
takes
away
from
the
mix
of
oats
and
hops
that
have
now
fully
emerged
its
dry
piney
and
hot
now
no
denying
it
brother
still
malty
sweetness
is
apparent
enough
for
me
to
forgive
forget
and
enjoy
completely
the
filmy
characteristics
could
use
a
hand
from
some
better
developed
carbonation
bubbling
is
large
sometimes
cumbersome
in
the
throat
taking
away
slightly
from
an
otherwise
stellar
drinking
beer
drinkability
since
this
was
the
first
time
enjoying
a
style
like
this
it
took
me
a
couple
bottles
to
get
acquainted
with
it
but
since
then
i
absolutely
love
how
drinkable
this
one
is
very
very
tasty
the
flavors
in
it
are
very
remarkable
and
pronounced
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
and
could
possible
be
a
nice
session
beer
pours
black
with
some
red
and
a
nice
dark
tan

twofinger
head
that
receeds
fairly
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
top
of
the
beer
lacing
left
at
the
top
half
of
the
glass
smells
of
roasted

some
coffee
maybe
even
some

of
roasted
malts
chocolate
coffee
and
a
little
bit
of

at
the
end
definitely
get
some
sweetness

of
roasted
coffeemalts

the
mouth
during
the
whole
drink
mouthfeel
is
medium
creamy
and
good
carbonation
seems
right
for
the
style
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
this
is
a
drinkable
stout
not
too
filling
great
taste
good
price
for
the
quality
no
reason
not
to
pick
this
one
up
again
reminds
me
of
chokolat
but
for
a
fraction
of
the
price
love
the
roastiness
to
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
a
great
oatmeal
stout
i
like
it
but
it
doesnt
have
the
creamy
smoothness
of
some
other
examples
of
this
style
the
drink
is
mediumfullish
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
is
highly
quaffable

given
the

oatmeal
stout
and
it
was
very
nice

but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
man
this
is
one
good
stout
i
could
have
myself
more
then
one
of
these
really
tasty
i
am
not
a
big
stout
fan
and
i
rate
this
on
its
style
more
than
my
personal
preference
for
this
style
a
very
good
beer
probably
my
favorite
from
ipswich
very
sessionable
stout
great
roastiness
without
being
to
cloyingly
sweet
tons
of
flavor
highly
recommend
a
really
great
stout
this
a
really
great
feeling
beer
with
a
big
feel
and
big
flavor
it
is
smooth
with
a
slight
milky
feel
and
goes
down
well
overallfantastic
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
great
stuff
kudos
to
ipswich
d
again
hard
to
overstate
how
smooth
this
7er
goes
down
good
solid
beer
with
enough
interesting
characteristics
to
make
it
rise
above
the
pack
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
stout
and
thought
it
had
great
smokey
roasted
flavor
certainly
surpassed
my
expectations
d
excellent
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
well
worth
a
try
found
at
la
boniche
restaurant
in
downtown
lowell
ma
this
one
poured
a
pitch
blackbrown
color
with
a
chocolate
colored
big
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
tart
malt
intensity
bitter
coffee
bean
a
bit
of
sour
milk
very
nice
actually
the
taste
is
a
beautiful
blend
of
coffee
and
mild
chocolate
a
very
pleasant
combination
of
bitterness
and
modest
sweetness
near
fullbodied
but
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
very
likeable
with
hints
of
apple
and
cinnamon
and
just
a
kiss
of
smoke
good
complexity
smooth
just
an
all
around
excellent
brew
a
great
surprise
and
highly
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
deep
deep
opaque
dark
brown
almost
black
there
is
a
very
thin
head
of
light
brown
head
wispy
lacing
left
on
the
sides
nose
is
slightly
smoked
with
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
great
roasted
coffee
is
the
most
predominant
flavoring
with
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
interweaved
with
the
chocolate
taste
with
the
finish
tasting
like
a
bowl
of
oatmeal
mouthfeel
is
heavier
bodied
slightly
oily
going
down
decent
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
could
see
myself
sitting
with
it
for
a
session
notes
this
one
i
thought
was
going
to
be
a
bit
bigger
but
none
the
less
a
nice
and
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
very
smooth
and
drinkable
at
the
cost
of
body
taste
is
a
less
sweet
slightly
bitter
chocolate
syrup
a
little
bit
chalky
but
not
in
an
overbearingly
artificial
or
powdery
way
chocolate
flavoring
lingers
nicely
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
with
hop
finish
plays
in
well
to
offset
the
sweetness
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
which
is
where
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
where
this
offering
suffers
a
bit
it
goes
a
little
weak
right
off
the
bat
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
heft
volume
body
behind
it
very
smooth
silky
if
not
complex
extremely
drinkable
a
great
session
stout
if
not
the
beall
and
endall
of
awesome
when
compared
to
some
other
local
stouts
like
grittys
black
fly
this
will
come
out
on
top
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
of
i
have
ever
had
very
smooth
and
not
overpowering
no
aroma
but
the
appearance
and
taste
compensate
not
the
darkest
body
but
a
unique
dirty
beige
head
that
sits
to
rest
full
circle
thick
lacing
light
roast
bubbly
carbonation
washes
the
stand
out
flavors
away
a
safe
dry
middle
ground
with
a
bit
of
a
tang
from
the
cocoa
notes
the
tang
lingers
well
after
the
conservative
center
a
well
balanced
ale
and
a
session
stout
for
those
with
an
abused
palate
very
good
oatmeal
stout
high
abv
for
an
oatmeal
stout
which
along
with
lots
of
flavor
contribute
to
a
big
oatmeal
stout
blipped
rare
auld
extra
stout
by
the
bloody
irish
boys
overall
this
is
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
thats
worth
a
shot
very
well
done
thanks
again
to
norica
for
sending
this
one
along
via
donkeyrunner
overall
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
wouldnt
mind
several
of
these
a
year
highly
recommend
and
cant
wait
to
try
some
other
beers
from
them
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
d
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
only
the
smoothness
of
the
stout
comes
through
a
nice
nightcap
to
me
maybe
the
best
bottled
stout
ive
never
had
it
on
tap
but
i
reckon
itd
be
even
better
smooth
feel
of
surprisingly
tight
bubbles
of
carbonation
with
a
creaminess
aided
by
the
oats
tastes
of
roasted
chocolate
and
espresso
alcohol
content
is
nowhere
to
be
found
save
for
a
glowing
warmth
leaves
a
finishing
taste
of
faintly
bitter
hops
and
roasted
malts
very
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
good
value
too
i
found
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
friends
house
and
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
so
to
call
it
a
pleasant
surprise
would
be
an
understatement
its
got
some
guts
and
some
very
enjoyable
traits
that
make
it
an
effortless
quaff
and
despite
an
abv
that
could
sneak
up
on
one
its
a
warm
welcome
as
well
ill
gladly
keep
my
eyes
open
for
other
offerings
by
ipswich
in
the
future
not
to
mention
this
one
in
particular
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
dissipates
quickly
to
form
a
cap
smells
of
chocolate
some
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
licorice
some
subdued
hops
taste
is
roasty
chocolaty
bit
of
acridic
bitterness
finishing
with
a
nice
lingering
roast
and
hop
aftertaste
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
ample
carbonation
great
little
oatmeal
stout
lots
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
full
body
its
very
drinkable
truly
one
of
the
better
stouts
around
the
finish
i
think
is
near
perfection
and
the
aftertaste
is
just
awesome
its
a
little
hard
to
find
around
me
but
its
worth
every
minute
spent
searching
d
pretty
good
though
the
it
would
be
work
to
have
more
than
one
this
is
everything
i
ever
wanted
from
a
stout
my
heart
is
aflutter
ok
im
on
a
stout
kick
and
have
had
trouble
finding
much
variety
in
the
stores
around
here
the
local
brew
pub
lost
their
brewer
so
its
pretty
slim
pickens
but
this
just
came
in
to
the
local
liquor
store
and
its
a
keeper
it
has
a
nice
dark
color
the
head
is
nicely
colored
as
well
with
kind
of
a
mocha
chocolate
hue
it
gets
a
bit
thin
as
you
drink
it
however
especially
for
an
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
is
amazing
with
a
kind
of
thick
satisfying
blend
of
hops
and
a
rich
sweetness
including
chocolate
and
espresso
about
the
only
criticism
i
can
think
of
is
the
label
which
is
kind
of
bland
and
boring
but
maybe
that
will
grow
on
me
mercury
has
another
winner
here
they
really
make
some
impressive
beer
the
only
thing
not
to
like
about
this
one
is
the
mouthfeel
too
thin
other
than
that
theres
loads
of
win
in
here
highly
recommended
cheers
this
beer
isnt
going
to
wow
a
lot
of
people
like
some
other
more
elusive
stouts
out
there
but
this
guy
is
an
excellent
go
to
stout
easily
drinkable
very
well
crafted
recommended
on
a
cold
night
by
the
fire
where
i
am
now
ok
you
got
my
attention
mercury
brewing
company
im
ready
to
try
more
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
small
receding
brown
head
nice
chocolate
oatmeal
aroma
with
a
heavy
slick
palate
beer
has
some
body
to
it
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
oatmeal
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
molasses
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
not
a
factor
in
the
flavor
overall
this
is
what
i
am
talking
about
a
nice
stout
that
isnt
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
but
delivers
full
bore
on
the
flavor
rich
and
creamy
subtle
and
distinct
i
would
not
shy
away
from
this
one
anytime
12oz
bottle
from
a
mixed
12pack
from
market
basket
pours
a
completely
opaque
black
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
tanlight
brown
head
roastiness
and
toastiness
emanate
from
the
aroma
toastiness
and
roastiness
characterize
the
flavor
as
well
dark
chocolate
comes
to
mind
for
sure
hints
of
espresso
rich
full
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
while
not
overly
drinkable
by
some
standards
one
sip
most
definitely
invites
another
one
of
the
finest
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
wasnt
my
taste
in
the
style
at
all
the
bitterness
is
too
acrid
and
the
sweetness
is
a
malty
flavor
i
dont
really
care
for
overall
it
reminded
me
of
a
stale
generic
milk
chocolate
bar
hv
pours
a
black
sea
of
a
brew
that
spreads
a
delicious
oatmeal
chocolate
covered
raisin
aroma
out
into
the
air
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
malt
and
sweet
oatmeal
a
delicious
stout
that
ranks
among
the
top
dogs
in
the
category
a
great
masking
of
the
alcohol
made
possible
by
rich
chocolate
malt
and
oatmeal
flavors
a
good
night
cap
brew
that
begs
to
be
sipped
fireside
a
little
fizz
on
the
tongue
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
dynamite
local
stout
another
great
beer
from
these
guys
do
give
it
a
try
the
mouthfeel
was
generally
smooth
and
overall
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
seems
a
little
big
to
be
just
7
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
disk
of
milk
chocolate
head
smell
is
huge
wonderful
aromas
of
bread
bakers
chocolate
roasty
and
nutty
with
an
impressive
dark
fruit
raisins
covered
in
chocolate
dominance
taste
great
begins
sweet
dark
fruit
chocolate
granola
toast
raspberry
at
the
swallow
left
with
a
roasty
oaty
and
a
very
nice
floral
breath
after
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
even
as
roasty
as
this
is
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
wonderful
way
to
celebrate
finally
having
electricity
a
fantastic
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
wish
i
had
many
more
of
these
i
did
pick
up
some
alcohol
on
the
finish
towards
the
end
of
the
pint
which
might
limit
the
drink
a
bit
but
since
the
beer
was
initially
served
rather
cold
i
think
i
let
the
carbonation
outgas
a
bit
much
given
the
open
time
next
time
ill
let
the
bottle
warm
a
bit
prior
to
opening
look
forward
to
trying
again
drinkability
definitely
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
i
have
had
well
balanced
and
pleasant
will
definitely
buy
some
more
as
the
colder
weather
rolls
in
drinkability
is
very
nice
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
however
this
offering
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
of
them
all
this
is
a
very
above
average
oatmeal
stout
with
nothing
spectacular
to
it
if
you
have
a
friend
who
has
never
had
an
oatmeal
stout
let
them
try
this
as
it
is
a
really
good
example
without
being
crazy
pours
pitchblack
some
brown
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
vigorous
pour
produces
a
massive
and
glorious

fades
very
slowly
and
leaves
nice
patches

i
could
drink
this
all
year
long
and
i
do
one
of
my
personal
favorites
and
made
locally
just
a
brilliant
beer
and
this
is
the
oatmeal
stout
i
use
as
a
basis
for
comparison
for
anything
else
in
the
style
d
a
pretty
easy
drinking
stout
thanks
to
corey0212
for
including
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
what
a
surprise
this
beer
is
really
delicious
pours
black
with
a
fairly
short
but
nice
coffee
crema
colored
head
roasty
aromas
with
a
good
dose
of
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
beautiful
flavor
of
bitter
chocolate
that
just
resonates
nicely
with
the
light
roastiness
and
vanilla
there
is
a
touch
of
cream
there
at
the
end
as
well
very
nicely
balanced
smooth
and
mouthcoating
just
delicious
to
drink
the
bitterness
and
cocoa
and
roastiness
really
are
combined
very
well
i
would
definitely
buy
this
if
it
were
local
to
me
d
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
is
the
lingering
bitterness
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
very
nice
everyday
stout
give
it
a
little
age
first
if
you
dont
like
hoppy
stouts
tastes
like
it
was
brewed
in
the
tradition
of
englishbred
oatmeal
stouts
the
easiest
description
is
that
this
beer
tastes
like
i
imagine
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
fresh
very
smooth
milk
chocolate
with
oats
like
how
they
taste
in
a
cookie
and
a
java
edge
the
body
is
smooth
and
the
medium
weight
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
pours
black
the
taste
is
chocolate
and
coffee
this
beer
has
a
full
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
and
oily
mouthfeel
that
i
began
to
enjoy
more
and
more
as
i
got
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
am
a
big
fan
of
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
and
they
gave
them
a
run
for
their
money
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
good
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
not
too
overpowering
but
just
enough
richness
to
sustain
the
roasted
character
a
wonderfully
creamy
texture
and
a
lingering
malt
character
make
this
one
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
stout
cheers
grabbed
a
bottle
while
hanging
out
with
friends
at
trident
on
newbury
tonight
poured
into
a
smallish
beer
glass
very
dark
brown
in
color
a
very
thin
head
formed
which
was
a
bit
of
a
negative
surprise
smell
was
good
very
coffee
like
taste
was
excellent
nice
balance
of
flavor
this
is
the
first
oatmeal
stout
that
ive
had
in
a
while
that
actually
tasted
like
an
oatmeal
stout
and
not
just
a
regular
stout
very
thick
in
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
some
substance
a
great
beer
on
a
rainy
night
to
just
sit
with
and
let
it
warm
up
and
taste
all
of
that
excellent
flavor
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
mercury
d
drinkability
is
good
for
this
oatmeal
stout
there
is
a
balance
of
flavor
that
works
well
with
my
palate
it
is
very
very
smooth
the
alcohol
stays
well
hidden
ipswich
really
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
recommended
to
anyone
who
likes
a
good
stout
poured
a
deep
black
with
brown
around
the
edges
it
looked
like
syrup
as
it
poured
and
left
small
specks
on
the
mug
taste
and
smell
both
had
a
chocolatecoffee
flavor
it
didnt
feel
as
thick
as
it
looked
when
pouring
and
had
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
cant
say
that
i
loved
it
but
i
enjoyed
it
enough
that
i
would
try
it
again
d
big
thanks
to
joepais
for
this
extra
this
is
one
of
the
best
oatmeal

ive
tried
a
great

thanks
again
the
hop
barrage
and
the
abv
probably
disqualify
ipswich
oatmeal
stout
as
a
session
beer
thats
okay
i
rarely
session
anyway
this
expertly
crafted
ale
is
a
tribute
to
its
brewers
and
is
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
access
to
if
you
do
consider
yourself
fortunate
oatmeal
stout
is
a
matter
of
taste

it
has
been
awhile

an
inky
black
with
a
deep
dark
head
that
is
very
promising
and
enticing
there
could
be
a
thicker
frothier
head
and
that
would
have
sealed
the
deal
for
me
the
head
is
very
modest
and
doesnt
retain
nearly
long
enough
the
lacing
is
okay
this
is
a
thick
dark
full
bodied
ale
with
plenty
of
character
the
smell
as
everyone
else
mentioned
is
roasted
or
charred
oats
grains
burnt
malts
dark
roasted
coffee
or
espresso
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
slightly
off
sweet
malt
aroma
perhaps
a
bit
phenolic
thankfully
the
off
aromas
seemed
to
dissipate
as
the
beer
settles
the
taste
is
robust
and
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
me
it
doesnt
have
an
oppressively
high
abv
but
this
is
a
thick
coffee
slightly
sweet
oaty
biscuity
deep
roated
malty
ale
if
there
ever
was
one
i
do
like
this
better
than
an
imperial
stout
because
it
displays
less
biting
astringency
and
harsh
flavors
this
beer
is
not
to
everyones
tastes
i
appreciate
the
style
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
as
for
oatmeal
stouts
i
prefer
sam
smiths
a
bit
more
there
is
a
creamy
oily
inky
mouthfeel
and
this
carries
on
into
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
smooth
deep
and
dark
and
it
does
make
a
statement
serving
type
bottle
d
the
very
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
astounded
at
the
difference
between
it
and
other
stouts
that
i
had
had
previously
this
is
far
superior
to
most
of
those
though
the
uncommonly
thick
body
took
some
getting
used
to
compared
to
the
guinness
and
other
dry
stouts
that
i
swore
by
back
in
the
day
having
since
graduated
to
imperial
stouts
i
still
find
each
sip
of
this
old
favorite
to
be
something
i
savor
and
enjoy
going
down
nice
and
easy
and
whetting
the
pallet
for
the
next
delicious
sip
there
is
a
good
reason
why
this
is
still
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
d
very
rich
robust
and
a
full
hearty
oatmeal
that
was
enjoyable
the
beer
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
would
like
for
a
beer
of
this
style
it
is
drinkable
but
its
heavy
in
my
stomach
pours
a
deep
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
great
look
to
it
it
has
a
sweet
oatmealy
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
body
the
taste
is
really
good
very
nice
sweet
malty
body
with
hints
of
chocolate
at
the
end
goes
down
really
smooth
as
it
has
a
nice
velvety
mouthfeel
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
which
makes
it
a
really
drinkable
beer
a
must
try
for
all
the
stout
drinkers
out
there
a
used
motor
oil
jet
black
body
is
the
host
to
an
awsome
two
finger
thick
milk
chocolate
colored
head
with
huge
rocky
bubbles
decent
staying
power
as
it
clings
to
the
glass
you
start
to
get
the
nose
on
this
one
as
you
pop
the
cap
roaste
malts
and
chocolatey
oats
create
a
subtle
but
beckoning
aroma
enters
tha
mouth
with
very
bold
richness
that
really
takes
over
the
entire
palate
lovely
darkness
coats
the
mouth
with
notes
of
dark
roasted
coffee
uakers
chocolate
and
a
bitterness
that
reallly
hangs
on
to
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
super
thick
like
it
begs
for
the
next
sip
the
drinkability
is
only
slightly
hampered
by
the
bitter
that
hangs
around
wonderful
brew
that
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
thanks
to
tayner
for
the
extra
flavors
of
charred
malt
plum
slightly
sweet
and
a
little
boozy
aftertaste
is
somewhat
earthy
chalky
and
dries
out
the
palate
after
having
several
other
big
beers
my
impression
was
that
this
was
a
good
stout
but
more
dry
and
boozy
than
what
i
would
normally
look
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
pours
like
motor
oil
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
does
not
really
stick
around
all
that
long
nose
is
nice
rich
chocolate
malts
flavor
is
extremely
robust
with
a
strong
roasted
quality
to
it
coffee
tones
are
there
as
well
leaves
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
feel
is
extremely
thick
on
the
liquid
and
low
on
the
bubble
very
drinkable
a
bit
thick
which
might
turn
some
off
but
i
have
to
say
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
as
i
had
no
expectation
worth
trying
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
one
of
the
top
oatmeal
stouts
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
stout
as
the
flavor
profile
is
so
big
and
tasty
nice
beer
to
have
any
time
of
year
another
solid
beer
from
the
ipswich
line
from
mercury
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
it
wasnt
for
the
higher
abv
i
had
two
bottles
and
enjoyed
every
last
sip
stiffly
carbonated
the
body
is
underweight
ashy
not
the
feel
i
was
expecting
it
itches
this
was
a
staple
of
mine
back
in
my
boston
days
so
im
glad
to
see
it
on
the
shelves
in
nj
its
full
of
flavour
and
well
balanced
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
grab
some
if
you
spot
it
i
could
do
this
as
a
session
although
at
7
i
might
regret
it
in
the
morning
it
sort
of
reminded
me
of
a
less
boozy
version
of
a
stockyard
oatmeal
stout
thanks
to
leftmindedrightly
for
this
brew
it
is
fantastic
and
i
must
track
down
some
more
soon
poured
into
an
american
pint
opaque
black
in
color
with
a
generous
light
coffeecolored
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
intact
layer
during
the
tasting
consistent
lacing
throughout
the
serving
scent
of
roasted
coffee
malt
oatmeal
and
brown
sugar
slightly
effervescent
in
the
mouth
consistency
was
a
little
more
watery
than
i
remember
but
pleasant
nonetheless
more
flavors
of
roasted
coffee
and
perhaps
molasses
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
a
cool
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
it
a
wonderfully
crafted
brew
dthis
is
a
very
well
balanced
stout
the
well
hidden
alcohol
and
rich
mouthfeel
make
this
a
winner
in
my
book
d
enjoyable
could
have
more
than
one
pours
out
black
with
a
2
finger
thick
chocolate

mildly
roasty

the
oatmeal
apparant
taste
is
mild
bakers
chocolate
roasty
and
oatmeal
medium
in
the
mouth
and
very
refreshing
for
a
stout
off
the
charts
drinkability
does
not
bog
down
with
thickness
a
very
tasty
brew
worth
seeking
out
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
surprised
to
discover
high
abv
as
it
is
well
covered
tasty
and
smooth
love
the
look
and
feel
of
this
beer
but
i
do
wish
the
flavor
was
more
complex
i
could
almost
bump
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
a
half
point
if
there
was
just
some
extra
nuances
to
this
but
there
arent
still
cant
say
i
will
never
drink
this
again
i
really
cant
think
of
a
beer
with
a
better
mouthfeel
this
is
really
a
six
in
that
department
overall
a
beautiful
looking
and
damn
good
tasting
beer
here
d
fantastic
one
you
want
more
and
more
of
simply
amazing
for
the
style
pours

this
at
7
very
well
done
not
to
be
missed
flavor
has
less
chocolate
and
more
coffee
than
the
aroma
especially
in
the
aftertaste
herbal
hop
bouquet
is
somewhat
prominent
but
seems
to
balance
fine
with
the
oatmeal
slight
acidity
pours
a
complete
opaque
midnight

frothy
two

stickiness
is
amazing
how
it
should
be
for
this
style
smell
is
a
very
smokey
roasted
malt
with
a
very
mild
oat
sweetness
blended
with
milk
chocolate
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
i
usually
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
but
that
doesnt
matter
very
roasted
malt
up
front
with
a
tiny
hop
bite
that
balances
it
out
well
midway
through
the
toasted
oat
flavor
emerges
followed
by
a
nuttycoffee
like
aftertaste
that
is
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
i
find
the
7
abv
hard
to
believe
but
thats
what
makes
this
brew
even
more
amazing
by
far
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
get
a
hold
of
this
one
for
sure
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
was
an
opaque
black
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
some
very
nice
lacing
it
had
a
dark
coffee
chocolate
aroma
espressoburnt
coffee
taste
a
little
chocolate
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
were
enhanced
as
the
beer
warmed
a
rich
beer
and
very
nice
to
drink
pours
an
opaque
darkness
with
a
big
tan
head
that
resists
fading
enjoying
the
3d
lacing
the
smell
is
really
faint
and
obscure
until
it
warms
up
significantly
i
get
a
little
bit
of
roasted
texture
and
an
earthiness
from
the
oat
full
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
first
off
creamy
full
flavored
the
mild
roasted
malt
and
oat
notes
are
complemented
by
the
feel
and
aroma
the
7
abv
is
real
but
easily
well
hidden
by
these
stout
no
pun
intended
ingredients
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
if
i
have
the
opportunity
this
is
a
local
favorite
of
mine
poured
into
a
english
style
pint
glass
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
lace
on
top
in
the
aroma
were
earth
tones
similar
to
a
dry
stout
chocolate
cake
oatmeal
and
a
bit
of
burnt
coffee
bean
flavors
that
i
was
able
to
pick
up
on
included
more
burnt
coffee
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
and
the
oatmeal
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
heavy
and
surprisingly
pronounced
with
the
hops
making
it
more
robust
than
some
of
the
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
tasted
even
with
the
7
abv
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
still
though
i
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
so
that
more
of
the
nuances
can
pull
through
and
make
themselves
known
goes
great
with
blue
cheese
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
black
and
roasted
malt
scent
its
bold
and
earthy
with
some
light
oatmeal
notes
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
black
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
earthy
with
some
mild
warming
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
os
but
it
could
use
some
more
body
imo
its
dry
and
earthy
with
an
elevated
abv
it
just
lacks
body
highly
recommended
worth
seeking
out
andor
trading
for
definintely
a
good
brew
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
around
d
rich
fullflavored
oatmeal
stout
my
favorite
of
this
style
ive
tried
to
date
heavy
coffee
and
chocolate
this
seems
ideally
paired
with
smoky
meats
or
a
chocolatey
dessert
a
sipper
very
satisfying
thanks
clockworkorange
and
donkeyrunner
for
the
awesome
treat
aftertaste
is
like
bittersweet
chocolate
satisfying
yet
making
you
want
for
more
appears
dark
with
no
head
whatsoever
and
no
evidence
of
carbonation
smell
was
dominated
by
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
hint
of
the
oats
the
taste
was
a
strong
full
chocolate
malt
flavor
along
with
burnt
coffee
and
molassas
the
oatmeal
made
a
pleasant
appearance
in
the
aftertaste
also
i
could
definately
detect
the
alcohol
which
unfortunately
was
one
of
the
defining
features
of
the
aftertaste
still
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
and
if
stout
is
the
name
of
your
game
id
check
it
out
the
beer
went
down
heavy
and
warm
and
filled
me
up
but
not
so
much
that
i
didnt
enjoy
another
beer
or
two
after
this
one
nearly
black
with
chestnut
edges
and
a
fluffy
brown
head
as
the
foam
settled
slowly
spotty
chunks
of
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
nice
aroma
equal
parts
roast
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
acidity
bitterness
was
solid
but
well
balanced
with
the
malt
roast
was
a
little
less
prominent
in
the
flavour
which
allowed
the
sweeter
malts
to
contribute
a
bit
more
overall
milk
and
dark
chocolate
were
evident
as
was
caramel
and
a
little
toffee
hints
of
vanilla
and
oats
faded
in
and
out
the
oats
really
smoothed
out
the
texture
not
quite
oily
but
full
and
even
with
creamy
carbonation
this
beer
just
hits
all
the
right
notes
in
all
categories
very
well
made
and
quite
an
enjoyable
drink
d
i
wish
i
could
give
this
brew
a
4
999
the
only
reason
the
mouthfeel
is
lowered
is
just
since
that
would
take
the
littlest
off
the
score
i
dont
think
it
is
a
perfect
5
but
it
is
one
of
the
closest
beers
to
a
perfect
i
wish
i
could
get
this
here
overall
excelent
oatmeal
stout
a
little
bit
less
sweet
and
more
complex
than
that
of
the
standard
which
is
sam
smiths
the
alcohol
is
a
little
more
noticable
that
i
would
have
expected
but
in
no
way
overwhelming
certainly
a
stellar
brew
i
like
the
roasty
bitterness
of
this
brew
although
there
isnt
much
else
to
balance
it
out
which
detracts
from
the
overall
drinkablility
worth
a
try
poured
out
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
foamy
tan
head
and
sticky
lacing
the

sweet
dark

big
roasty
flavours
licorice
burnt
cocoa
coffee

mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
crbonated
creamy
hides
the

well
and
is
pretty
drinkable
despite
all
the
burnt
and
bitter
flavors
poured
beautiful
black
with
a
light
brown
one
finger
head
some
retention
lacey
no
strong
bouquet
but
definitely
a
sense
of
roast

wine
and
some
sort
of
chemical
appetizing
and
uneasy
all
at
once
this
disappeared
with
the
first
sip
mmm
i
wish
chocolate
ice
cream
tasted
this
good
a
little
mineral
bitterness
but
mostly
creamy
oat
chocolicioiusness
yum
felt
good
going
down
i
could
drink
this
til
i
pass
out
on
the
bar
nice
job
mass
feels
a
bit
too
thin
yet
it
doesnt
let
down
the
flavor
the
dryness
makes
me
wonder
why
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
not
very
smooth
drinkability
kinda
border
line
when
it
comes
to
a
dark
beer
too
roasty
for
me
you
need
to
have
a
taste
to
drink
these
types
of
beer
wasnt
a
bad
beer
to
try
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
6
pack
anytime
soon
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
brow
almost
black
with
two
full
fingers
of
creamy
tan
head
smells
of
raisins
roasted
coffee
and
burnt
sugar
tastes
of
deep
roasted
espresso
bittersweet
cocoa
and
burnt
caramel
malts
rich
and
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
tasty
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
ones
highly
recommended
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
quite
drinkable
with
a
great
smooth
taste
d
a
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
in
all
respects
however
i
suspect
that
scaling
back
the
alcohol
might
improve
overall
drinkability
notes
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
while
up
in
boston
really
good
drinking
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
stout
is
so
smooth
it
feels
like
you
are
drinking
a
frappe
theres
a
nice
assortment
of
complementary
flavors
that
achieve
complexity
without
screaming
for
attention
another
outstanding
ale
from
ipswich
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
quite
drinkable
stout
fans
should
seek
this
one
out
overall
a
well
made
american
stout
worth
the
trip
over
the
border
to
massachusetts
nice
rich
coffee
and
chocolate
roast
on
the
flavor
and
aroma
full
bodied
and
velvety
with
help
from
the
oats
i
suppose
it
was
my
end
of
the
night
beer
in
a
nice
small
smokefree
bar
i
would
certainly
do
this
again
its
a
shame
that
people
are
so
fooled
by
the
ever
flavorreduced
international
brands
i
guess
theyre
selling
notions
rather
than
damn
good
stout
like
this
one
and
so
many
others
the
alcohol
was
hardly
detectable
as
i
was
drinking
the
beer
but
it
definitely
caught
up
to
me
by
the
end
this
definitely
was
not
one
of
the
easier
drinking
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
tried
but
it
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
kind
of
filling
but
this
beer
is
an
excellent
sipper
i
would
consider
this
beer
drinkable
for
such
a
heavy
brew
i
would
probably
want
to
move
onto
something
a
tad
more
sweet
or
quaint
after
a
couple
of
these
though
only
so
much
charness
and
burnt
flavors
you
can
take
in
one
sitting
this
is
one
helluva
manly
stout
overall
a
superior
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
to
date
very
quaffable
and
a
very
good
abv
d
this
is
a
good
beer
much
more
roasted
than
your
everyday
oatmeal
stout
yet
balanced
and
drinkable
served
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
an
ink
black
with
about
a
quarter
inch
of
coffee
brown

that
instantly
dissapeared
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
smelled
of
roasted
nuts
fresh
coffee
beans
and
faintly
of
milk
chocolate
tasted
very
bitterly
of
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
somewhat
thin
rubbery
bitter
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
heavy
as
dictated
by
the
style
well
carbonated
could
deliver
a
more
creamyfrothy

but
still
quite
drinkable
mercury

continues
to
impress
drank
a
lot
of
this
last
time
i
was
in
bostoncambridge
for
chaduvels
wedding
good
times
smuggled
one
nice
bottle
into
utah
pours
a
dark
chocolate
black
with
a
solid
inch
of
dark
cocoa
brown
head
looking
good
nose
is
a
nice
mix
of
roasted

and
sweeter

chocolate
candy
bar
taste
follows
suit
with
pronounced
roasted
bitterness
and
light
peatiness
up
front
and
throughout
more
pronounced
than
a
typical
oatmeal
stout
perhaps
i
dont
mind
this
at
all
i
like
it
creamy
frothy
mediumfull
bodied
feel
reveals
a
restrained
dark
chocolate
sweetness
midpalate
satisfyingly
bittersweet
finish
that
lasts
a
while
very
good
what
a
damn
fine
session
oatmeal
stout
ipswich
continues
to
blow
me
away
with
how
simple
and
yet
so
tasty
their
brews
are
nothing
that
floors
me
but
would
honestly
be
the
first
choice
for
any
session
drinkability
good
less
the
bitterness
ill
take
another
hit
richly
smooth
and
creamy
but
not
heavy
so
it
goes
down
easily
very
mild
carbonation
with
burnt
bitterness
in
its
place
really
good
beer
i
didnt
want
it
to
end
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
completely
opaque
head
was
a
deep
tan
color
smells
of
roasted
coffee
the
first
sip
has
an
initial
bitter
bite
that
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
malty
chocolatey
flavor
oat
smell
and
taste
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
the
chocolate
flavor
is
enhanced
as
you
let
the
beer
sit
on
your
palate
the
beer
is
smooth
and
thick
easy
to
drink
best
enjoyed
by
sipping
da
medium
not
perfect
for
a
stout
this
a
longsipper
one
or
two
of
these
would
do
you
fine
but
definitely
worth
getting
drinkability
quite
good
very
heavy
beer
but
roasty
and
tasty
and
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
thos
craftsmen
up
at
mercury
know
what
theyre
doing
mouthfeel
highly
carbonated
for
a
stout
which
i
found
suprising
full
bodied
at
the
same
time
not
the
most
drinkable
stout
ive
ever
had
but
another
very
good
brew
from
a
very
good
local
brewery
m
d
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
very
high
on
this
cask
offering
from
mercury
love
it
in
a
bottle
love
it
even
more
on
cask
extra
smooth
dry
finish
with
a
full
bodied
well
balanced
beginning
i
could
have
had
at
least
a
few
of
these
mercury
keeps
pumping
them
out
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
new
england
musings
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
indeed
a
little
stronger
that
other
oatmeals
that
i
like
and
you
know
it
as
substantial
a
brew
as
you
will
find
the
multilayered
taste
is
nice
but
not
as
complex
and
enjoyable
as
mcneills
drinkability
2
too
bitter
and
burnt
for
drinking
great
for
cooking
would
make
a
nice
chili
or
au
jus
i
drink
this
fine
fine
stout
with
spoot129
and
wbrown
and
it
truly
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
stout
the
appearance
is
totally
opaque
with
a
great
cremy
head
smell
is
espresso
chocolate
malt
and
that
distinctive
american
hop
bite
the
taste
is
warm
malty
and
heavy
but
the
hops
are
not
obscured
the
finishing
taste
is
incredibly
similar
to
the
lingering
bite
of
espresso
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
viscous
and
chewy
which
is
everything
a
stout
should
be
the
drinkability
i
have
to
give
a
4
5
because
while
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
have
to
apply
force
to
get
it
into
my
mouth
and
down
my
throat
its
like
a
beerfrappe
great
stout
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
large
foamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
not
as
strong
as
i
would
likebut
it
does
have
a
coffee
aroma
the
taste
is
outstanding
your
mouth
gets
a
blast
of
expresso
coffee
beans
and
then
a
nice
malt
and
hop
aftertaste
the
mf
is
heavy
and
very
well
balancedalthough
not
as
complex
as
other
stouts
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
will
put
this
high
on
my
buy
again
list
d
if
youre
in
the
mood
or
its
the
appropriate
pairing
very
good
but
not
an
everyday
drinker
for
me
very
similar
to
the
now
passed
heart
of
darkness
from
vt
this
is
a
solid
all
around
beer
not
something
id
track
down
but
something
to
fall
back
on
definitely
a
great
winter
brew
a
very
well
done
oatmeal
stout
man
this
stout
is
good
dark
creamy
and
richly
smooth
this
is
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
most
impressive
is
the
creamy
lofty
tall
brown
eggshell
head
that
compliments
the
opaque
dark
cola
brew
lace
gathers
slight
and
disappears
small
continuous
bubbles
make
their
way
to
the
cola
surface
the
nose
is
small
relative
to
expectation
yet
big
with
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
burnt
malts
taste
shimmers
in
a
mediumbig
mouthfeel
smooth
it
is
not
but
busy
with
burnt
malt
coffee
subtle
sweet
the
pungency
sweeps
forward
on
the
palate
and
lingers
a
drying
moment
allows
for
the
hops
to
express
gently
unfortunately
a
metallic
essence
challenged
the
tasting
throughout
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
good
all
the
same
ipswichs
oatmeal
stout
is
a
hardy
rich
delicious
stout
the
look
is
black
completely
opaque
one
finger
brown
head
real
roasted
malt
chocolately
dry
and
smoky
coffee
earthy
this
is
a
great
stout
not
too
boozy
very
balanced
very
smoky
and
earthy
is
how
i
would
differentiate
this
from
other
stouts
6
for
a
growler
at
harringtons
in
chelmsford
ma
recommended
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
beautiful
caramel
head
forms
remains
for
a
while
thick
consistency
results
in
a
nice
lace
smells
of
coffee
even
a
bit
like
chocolate
tastes
a
lot
like
it
smells
chocolate
coffee
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
a
thick
fullbodied
ale
that
works
on
the
palate
i
feel
the
drinkability
is
low
however
due
to
the
thickness
of
the
beer
be
advised
though
if
you
love
stouts
youll
love
this
one
i
prefer
a
lighter
ale
and
think
this
one
is
a
bit
thick
drinkability
and
notes

a
good
oatmeal
stout
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
few
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
are
it
has
good
balance
but
a
decent
flavor
and
oatmeal
is
good
for
you
so
grab
some
if
you
see
it
pours
from
the
12oz
bottle
an
inky
black
with
a
coffeecolored
head
of
about
12
inch
that
slowly
dissipates
rich
nose
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
espresso
and
a
touch
of
oats
palate
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
some
lactose
almost
like
a
milk
stout
deepening
to
a
full
roasted
flavor
of
chocolate
malt
coffee
oats
a
faint
hint
of
hop
bitterness
for
balance
and
the
slightest
touch
of
licorice
nice
warming
sensation
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
body
is
rich
and
creamy
but
lacking
just
a
shade
of
the
depth
that
would
make
it
the
perfect
stout
body
a
good
dessert
beer
especially
with
the
awesome
double
chocolate
chunk
cookie
im
enjoying
it
with
this
beer
is
as
black
as
black
can
get
dark
tan
head
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
sweet
malts
and
herbal
hops
it
creates
an
almost
sour
flavor
to
it
very
nutty
and
roasted
flavor
as
well
this
is
a
heavy
beer
yet
very
smooth
as
well
the
sourness
creates
a
mouthfeel
that
i
didnt
enjoy
too
much
drinkability
is
not
that
high
either
i
couldnt
imagine
stomaching
more
than
2
of
these
thanks
to
carmen
for
the
bottles
note
was
awesome
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
this
is
a
stout
that
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
largely
bitter
from
heavily
toasted
malts
but
the
hop
flower
is
not
ignored
youll
see
it
in
the
aftertaste
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
dark
brown
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
with
floaties
visible
head
fades
down
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
and
lacing
is
heavy
minimal
aroma
is
deep
dark
malts
with
oatmeal
presence
apparent
in
the
heartiness
of
it
all
taste
is
again
all
about
the
dark
grains
with
the
bitterness
inherent
in
such
a
product
could
have
been
smoothed
out
a
bit
more
here
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
but
if
the
coffee
bitterness
could
have
balanced
a
bit
more
it
would
have
excelled
in
my
mind
worth
a
try
for
sure
had
this
brew
the
other
night
had
not
had
anything
from
mercury
brewing
company
before
actually
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
of
them
well
i
must
say
i
am
glad
that
i
made
the
choice
to
give
this
brew
a
try
brew
poured
to
a
jet
dark
color
held
it
up
to
the
light
after
my
wife
said
that
it
looked
like
tar
no
light
coming
through
what
so
ever
had
a
nice
solid
clumpy
dark
tan
head
that
had
very
good
retention
and
left
a
nice
amount
of
chunky
lacing
through
out
the
aroma
is
all
about
burnt
malt
and
charcoal
chocolate
coffee
and
a
little
hop
smell
the
first
think
that
i
notice
about
this
brew
are
the
burnt
malt
flavors
that
seem
to
hit
you
up
front
and
then
i
notice
smooth
flavors
of
chocolate
and
a
oat
taste
the
hop
taste
builds
and
mixed
with
an
espresso
like
flavor
seems
to
be
quite
acidic
but
goes
well
with
this
brew
over
all
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
am
glad
i
stumbled
on
it
i
must
get
some
more
of
this
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
reasonable
tan
head
the
head
settles
very
quickly
to
a
sheet
of
lace
that
settles
further
to
a
streaky
residue
on
the
glass
mild
roast
malt
and
chocolate
aromas
that
have
a
black
cherry
accent
on
the
finish
more
of
the
black
cherry
in
the
flavor
along
with
smoky
hints
delivered
by
the
malt
great
velvet
mouth
feel
and
a
reasonable
alcohol
content
make
this
very
drinkable
this
is
another
good
offering
from
the
folks
at
mercury
this
impressive
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
smooth
dark
brown
color
and
produces
a
dark
tan
thin
head
definite
black
coffee
aroma
and
roasted
malt
in
the
background
smooth
and
slightly
nutty
very
much
like
coffee
mouthfeel
is
rich
but
i
want
to
say
just
a
bit
watery
if
you
dont
really
like
the
taste
of
coffee
you
probably
shouldnt
drink
this
beer
but
otherwise
i
thought
it
was
awesome
12

thanks

cheers
reflection
i
am
a
stout
lover
and
i
am
adding
this
one
to
my
list
of
great
local
stouts
thanks
to
the
felonious
one
for
another
pours
a
pitch
black
wiht
a
generous
sticky
medium
brown
head
deep
rich
aromas
of
coffee
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
mild
alcohol
sweetness
on
the
nose
powerful
coffee
and
bitter
malts
dominate
the
palate
round
soft
finish
thanks
to
the
oats
mouthfeel
is
good
but
dry
and
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
overall
a
very
nice
easydrinking
dry
stout
nice
job
worth
a
try
for
sure
if
you
find
this
one
it
poured
from
the
bottle
a
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
decent
head
for
a
bottle
pour
the
aroma
is
of
haevy
malts
and
oats
the
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
the
taste
at
first
is
of
a
typical
stout
but
there
is
a
slight
hops
kick
with
the
finish
the
aftertaste
made
me
think
of
blueberry
but
very
ripe
and
dark
blueberries
pours
very
very
black
forming
a
little
rich
brown
colored
head
the
smell
of
roasted
malt
a
little
coffee
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
classic
stout
at
first
but
then
there
are
bitter
hops
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
bitter
hops
they
left
an
astringent
flavor
in
my
mouth
definitely
presents
of
coffee
flavors
are
in
there
the
mouth
feel
is
good
more
ale
style
than
a
pub
style
the
drinkability
is
average
for
me
because
i
could
have
one
maybe
two
of
these
per
night
the
bitter
hops
really
turned
me
off
very
drinkable
given
the
style
this
is
one
that
id
keep
in
stock
at
all
times
its
an
amazing
tasting
oatmeal
stout
and
one
that
never
gets
old
a
gem
missing
something
but
very
good
stout
i
am
really
enjoying
this
oatmeal
stout
i
had
a
growler
of
this
beer
several
years
ago
but
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
very
enjoyable
wow
what
a
beer
thanks
to
wyllder
for
this
one
this
was
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
pours
black
as
night
real
thick
and
creamy
beautiful
foamy
brown
head
smells
great
complex
body
of
roasted
nuts
chocolate
and
espresso
comes
wafting
out
of
the
glass
this
brew
is
mighty
tasty
pefectly
balanced
malts
a
hint
of
sweetness
nutiness
and
a
brush
of
an
alcohol
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
drinkability
are
you
kidding
me
i
had
to
force
myself
to
only
drink
one
at
a
time
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
can
get
it
buy
it
buy
all
of
it
and
enjoy
it
wyll
beer
is
good
happy
dark
beering
black
largely
opaque
there
is
only
a
slight
dark
brown
highlight
ideal
color
a
light
brown
head
of
two
fingers
in
height
stylishly
topped
off
the
beer
the
head
retention
was
excellent
a
firm
foamy
cap
lasted
for
a
long
while
almost
for
the
entire
consumption
the
subsequent
lacing
was
sporadic
and
webby
one
sniff
and
the
beer
said
im
an
oatmeal
stout
dummy
is
there
an
aroma
better
on
earth
then
a
perfectly
crafted
oatmeal
stout
i
think
not
succulent
sweetness
from
the
oats
blends
effortlessly
with
chocolate
notes
the
chocolate
is
absolutely
lovely
a
bit
of
modestly
roasted
coffee
beans
and
a
kiss
of
milky
sweetness
that
finds
a
home
with
a
return
of
the
chocolate
the
potency
is
very
sturdy
inviting
the
palate
is
astringent
upfront
with
more
burnt
flavors
than
the
nose
let
on
how
sneaky
the
hops
seem
more
playful
too
herbal
and
modestly
bitter
the
sweetness
of
the
oats
is
a
little
too
soft
the
chocolate
flavors
are
more
bittersweet
than
anything
regardless
this
is
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
it
is
plenty
hearty
with
subtle
graceful
qualities
the
finish
is
long
more
bitter
then
many
oatmeal
stouts
a
nod
to
its
heartiness
there
is
also
a
sweetness
then
dances
with
modest
chocolate
flavors
it
is
simply
lovely
mediumfull
in
body
with
modestly
low
but
natural
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
filling
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
was
much
bigger
than
any
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
maybe
this
is
not
traditional
but
it
is
very
tasty
and
damn
drinkable
thank
you
drweizen
for
the
bottle
in
the
bif
5
package
thanks
yankeeheel
if
you
like
beer
and
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
and
you
arent
allergic
to
yeast
alcohol
or
malt
then
i
bet
you
will
like
this
fine
midnight
black
stout
the
taste
is
a
great
blend
of
chocolate
hops
and
espresso
with
many
other
flavors
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
the
texture
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
lively
yet
not
overwhelming
carbonation
must
drink
more
we
drink
this
one
a
lot
it
has
a
predominant
smoky
flavour
of
burnt
coffee
and
yeast
the
nose
is
sweet
like
burnt
sugar
or
toffee
it
has
good
carbonation
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
and
is
for
sale
at
the
local
packy
at
least
it
was
when
we
lived
in
ma
honestly
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
imo
a
mediocre
head
when
poured
yielding
an
opaque
black
in
color
the
head
had
a
coffee
color
the
aroma
was
all
burnt
or
roasted
malt
very
sweet
on
the
finish
had
like
a
milk
stout
finish
the
finish
was
also
dry
leaving
a
hop
bitternesscoffee
tasteand
hints
of
roasted
grains
i
think
this
is
the
first
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
so
i
cannot
relate
it
to
anything
hops
become
more
noticed
after
a
few
sips
a
good
thickness
and
not
watered
down
which
makes
for
a
great
stout
full
bodied
and
also
easy
on
the
mouthfeel
creamy
with
a
slight
carbonated
bite
to
it
leaves
a
lingering
burnt
malt
and
coffee
taste
in
the
mouth
id
prefer
one
of
these
to
a
guinness
anyday
when
drinking
stouts
rings
of
spotty
lace
left
after
each
sip
a
bready
aroma
is
noted
ng
on
tap
at
redbones
one
of
those
dark
as
night
pours
the
head
was
gone
so
fast
i
didnt
get
a
good
glimpse
chocolate
brownie
meets
espresso
aroma
is
huge
taste
is
similar
to
all
dark
roast
with
some
70
dark
chocolate
in
the
finish
sheet
lacing
left
throughout
the
glass
mouthfeel
was
a
good
medium
and
rather
chewy
easily
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
if
not
my
top
pick
nothing
weak
or
restrained
about
this
beer
this
is
oatmeal
stout
for
serious
stout
drinkers
if
this
beer
was
a
person
it
would
have
a
huge
beard
lots
of
scars
and
carry
an
axe
at
all
times
this
is
a
deep
dark
opaque
black
colour
with
a
rich
dense
head
of
beigetan
foam
the
aromas
are
all
roastytoasty
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
rich
roasted
malts
caramel
chocolate
coffee
and
more
the
taste
is
quite
smokey
boozy
roastytoasty
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodiedthick
with
a
lovely
finish
and
the
drinkability
is
superb
thanks
to
pbrian
for
this
stout
one
of
the
best
brews
from
new
england
in
my
opinion
this
beer
pours
a
tenebrous
nearly
black
color
with
a
medium
thick
light
brown
head
head
retention
is
not
great
and
the
lacing
is
good
the
aroma
is
very
roasty
coffee
and
grain
rich
and
satisfyingly
tasty
with
a
pleasing
blend
of
coffee
malt
and
chocolate
there
is
an
underlying
faint
sweetness
throughout
as
well
the
deceptively
bitter
finish
kind
of
worms
its
way
in
the
hops
are
enough
to
keep
this
beer
very
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
imho
ipswich
makes
some
really
fine
brews
and
this
one
is
up
at
the
top
rung
of
excellence
apppearance
was
almost
black
with
a
big
creamy
head
coffee
and
malt
aromas
are
strong
and
balanced
betwen
the
two
taste
was
excellent
as
with
the
smell
coffee
and
malt
flavors
were
very
prominent
and
blended
hop
element
became
evident
in
the
aftertaste
and
further
complemented
the
overall
experience
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
was
good
with
a
decent
smooth
quality
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
lessens
with
a
little
time
chocolatey
and
coffee
like
aromas
dominate
slight
licorice
and
fruit
aromas
as
well
dry
chocolate
and
coffee
dominates
the
taste
as
well
but
to
better
effect
than
the
smell
grainy
slightly
buttery
toasted
sometimes
burnt
flavors
with
a
more
hops
biting
at
the
end
than
expected
contributing
to
the
dryness
some
smoky
qualities
in
both
aroma
and
taste
nice
clean
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
like
this
a
really
nice
stout
thats
very
drinkable
due
in
part
to
its
nice
clean
finish
the
head
was
small
but
was
that
hot
chocolate
foam
color
and
consistency
that
just
drives
me
wild
body
was
appropriately
dark
even
with
only
two
sips
left
in
the
glass
it
remained
opaque
except
at
the
edges
sweet
roasty
aroma
a
bit
of
burned
marshmallows
in
the
flavor
hops
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
but
give
the
beer
a
slight
metallic
flavor
the
head
is
modest
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
a
nice
chocolate
color
the
lace
forms
a
nice
covering
for
the
glass
sweet
chocolate
coffee
and
the
marvelous
aroma
of
roasted
grain
make
up
the
crisp
fresh
and
clean
nose
start
is
thickly
malt
ambrosial
and
the
top
rich
and
full
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
devastatingly
acidic
the
hops
powerful
in
their
bite
but
pleasing
to
the
palate
aftertaste
bittersweet
chocolate
dry
a
fine
beer
from
a
fine
brewery
that
i
see
only
rarely
these
days
and
this
bottle
was
a
gift
from
unclejimbo
on
his
recent
whirlwind
tour
of
phoenix
sky
harbor
air
port
mcdowell
road
and
papago
brewery
the
smell
is
more
coffee
and
malt
than
anything
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
come
through
at
first
taste
it
reminds
me
off
a
robust
porter
great
depth
of
flavor
a
gentle
balance
of
coffee
malt
and
hops
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
my
night
cap
taste
is
bitter
and
sweet
and
oaty
this
beer
screams
oatmeal
stout
from
6
miles
away
smoky

a
complex
beer
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
bit
of
sourness
grainy
oaty
but
strangely
smooth
and
tasty
flavors
linger
on
the
roof
of
your
mouth
forever
its
like
drinking
a
cigar
the
flavors
are
bold
and
strong
this
beer
is
just
damn
good

only
wish
i
could
get
more
of
it
where
i
live
a
definite
must
try
if
you
are
in
ma
served
on
draft
the
ipswich
oatmeal
is
quite
black
and
opaque
in
color
with
a
moderate
lingering
brown
head
roasted
malt
is
most
prevalent
in
the
aroma
accompanied
with
scents
of
coffee
and
oats
taste
is
right
on
par
with
the
nose
surprisingly
roasty
with
more
subltle
oatmeal
flavor
than
other
oat
stouts
and
definitive
cofeeish
undertones
body
is
fairly
full
and
finish
is
fairly
dry
leaving
a
slight
toasted
malt
aftertaste

some
slightly
astringent
and

nice
oatmeal

a
nice
brew
big
thanks
to
johnny

for
the
privledge
of
drinking
this
a
mans
beer
its
about
as
dark
as
hell
when
the
fires
go
out
and
as
bitter
as
the
most
unpopular
kid
in
school
this
is
the
first
ipswich
ive
tried
and
i
cant
say
i
was
expecting
much
but
i
was
surprised
by
a
very
burnt
almost
smokey
taste
and
a
thick
sweet
finishalmost

up
another
new

im
fortunate

here
dark
dark
black
with
a
thin
fading
dark
tan
head
smell
is
roasted
earthy
and
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
smell
does
not
prepare
me
for
the
taste
intense
roasted
dark
coffee
bean
flavors
incredibly
smooth
and
although
the
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
intense
the
phenomenal
smoothness
mellows
and
leaves
a
roasted
toasted
bread
flavor
on
the
palate
one
heck
of
a
beer
drink
up
pours
a
wonderful
black
with
a
big
beautiful
brown
head
amoung
the
most
visually
appealing
stouts
ive
glanced
at
roasty

flavor
is
quite
strong
hints

doh
malt
sweetness
is
there
as
is

quite
a

leave
it

after
much
further
product
testing
i
have
to
go
back
and
give
this
a
5
for
taste
it
simply
crushes
most
other
stouts
ive
tried
dar
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
dark
brown
foamy
head
smells
of
nice
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
round
and
full
as
the
roasted
malt
rushes
over
the
tongue
also
nuances
of
chocolate
and
coffee
hints
of
hop
bitterness
linger
in
the
back
of
the
throat
very
smooth
pleasant
and
balanced
flavor
that
keeps
its
rich
character
until
the
last
drop
thanks
go
to
unclejimbo
for
passing
along
the
bottle
poured
a
inky
black
with
brownish
edges
and
almost
no
head
whatsoever
pretty
heavy
viscous
consistency
cocoa
was
the
dominant
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
and
a
slight
hop
scent
the
tastebuds
were
also
treated
to
the
chocolate
malt
flavors
which
was
balanced
by
the
bittering
of
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
a
little
high
in
carbonation
which
caused
this
stout
to
feel
a
little
watery
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
was
also
a
little
overdone
otherwise
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
will
buy
it
again
probably
in
the
12
gallon
bottle
instead
of
the
6
pack
this
stout
poured
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
brown
foam
that
settled
rather
quickly
and
did
not
leave
much
lace
the
smell
was
very
nice
and
long
lasting
sweet
and
malty
with
oatmeal
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
was
rich
and
full
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
chicory
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
full
bodied
with
lowmedium
carbonation
there
was
a
pleasant
aftertaste
of
oatmeal
bitter
chocolate
and
hops
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
stout
take
time
to
savor
it
outstanding
oat
stout
big
on
roast
grain
and
oat
character
yes
beer
is
for
breakfast
a
very
nice
stout
wellbalanced
and
smooth
yet
just
a
little
robust
in
terms
of
the
burnt
roasted
flavors
for
my
tastes
pours
black
as
night
with
no
moon
or
clouds
slowly
appearing
head
quickly
vanishes
coffee
chocolate
and
and
fighting
malt
duel
for
supremecy
in
the
nose
of
this
drink
and
quite
fulfill
in
taste
unfortunately
there
is
no
born
on
date
and
i
can
tell
right
away
i
got
an
older
version
of
a
beer
that
should
be
obtained
fresh
fresh
fresh
still
a
tasty
stout
full
of
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
mediating
hop
a
little
bitter
on
the
rebound
would
be
great
with
a
meal
this
stout
poured
from
a
gallon
growler
deep
black
with
highlights
of
redbrown
the
head
was
tan
and
dissipated
quickly
leaving
little
trace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
full
of
roasted
and
black
malt
with
hints
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
rich
and
malty
at
the
start
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
with
the
roasted
barley
coming
to
the
front
the
aftertaste
is
long
and
pleasant
with
the
roasted
malt
bitterness
blending
with
flavors
of
coffee
oats
and
hops
the
oats
give
this
stout
a
nonastringent
mouthfeel
that
rolls
off
your
tongue
quite
nicely
without
that
charcoal
sting
all
in
all
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
that
good
year
round
the
growler
seems
to
be
the
more
complex
and
flavorful
recipe
than
that
of
the
12oz
bottle
recipe
this
is
my
favorite
beer
absolutely
black
with
a
nice
head
exceptionally
smooth
on
the
palate
with
very
noticeable
coffee
and
chocolate
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
my
father
who
is
a
sam
adams
fanatic
and
not
really
into
stouts
has
become
a
stoutaholic
because
of
ipswich
made
the
great
mistake
of
buying
the
growler
as
i
poured
it
i
noticed
it
blocks
out
light
better
than
an
eclipse
dark
and
rich
are
an
understatement
rich
roasted
chocolate
taste
hit
my
palatte
as
i
dink
this
this
is
my
second
favorite
stout
after
smuttynose
black
cat
stout
i
am
determined
to
find
this
on
tap
a
bighuge
thanks
to
pbrian
for
the
excellent
sample
of
one
of
my
top
510
styles
of
beer
notes
this
is
one
stout
i
cant
get
enough
of
one
of
the
most
drinkable
full
bodied
ales
i
have
run
into
in
a
long
time
a
treat
for
any
die
hard
stout
fan
especially
if
you
enjoy
oatmeal
stouts
pours
absolutely
black
with
a
nice
thick
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
away
smell
is
all
chocolate
and
coffee
huge
chocolate
aromas
dominate
taste
starts
off
very
dark
chocolatey
and
slowly
fades
into
a
nice
dark
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
linger
o
the
tongue
for
a
good
amount
of
time
the
brew
is
a
little
thin
for
an
oatmeal
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
is
holding
this
brew
back
extremely
drinkable
a
great
brew
that
is
just
a
little
short
of
being
absolutely
stellar
another
good
one
from
ipswich
thanks
to
the
bierman
for
the
brew
good
dark
head
strong
oatmeal
nose
starts
out
with
a
sweet
malty
taste
but
gradually
goes
to
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
very
dark
and
chewy
a
good
oatmeal
this
is
a
superb
meal
i
mean
oatmeal
stout
the
deep
roasted
flavors
are
balanced
beautifully
with
a
nice
hop
kick
and
a
wonderful
silky
mouthfeel
nicely
done
very
smooth
with
a
pleasant
almost
perfect
balance
of
grain
and
ripe
fruity
sweetness
and
coffee
and
subtle
hop
bitterness
a
top
notch
brew
took
home
a
growler
after
a
pint
at
the
local
now
this
is
my
kind
of
stout
a
stout
with
some
actual
flavour
going
on
i
think
i
found
a
new
favourite
stout
just
an
allaround
fantastic
beer
enough
said
decent
flavor
not
over
the
top
coffee
taste
probably
better
when
its
fresh
samples
received
a
little
dated
excellent
balance
of
black
coffee
with
black
malts
each
jumps
out
while
neither
dominates
the
coffee
is
a
heavy
roast
and
the
big
bitterness
plays
well
theres
a
subtle
bready
caramel
undertone
but
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
beans
are
the
big
flavors
good
stuff
ill
revisit
when
i
get
the
chance
the
flavor
does
not
have
that
strange
flaw
really
but
instead
has
light
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
lots
of
great
stiff
espresso
coffee
flavor
a
really
well
integrated
coffee
beer
albeit
on
the
lighter
side
of
robust
qualities
at
6
o
a
very
good
beer
definitely
an
upfront
coffee
flavor
but
the
coffee
allows
some
other
flavors
room
to
breath
a
real
nice
stout
after
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
a
while
i
have
to
say
i
did
not
enjoy
it
at
all
unfortunately
looked
like
an
average
stout
at
the
pour
trended
toward
dark
brown
hues
rather
than
the
pitch
black
color
of
other
stouts
aroma
was
faint
coffee
not
much
else
taste
was
extremely
unbalanced
to
me
all
i
got
from
it
was
bitter
astringent
coffee
grounds
no
oatmeal
sweetness
at
all
very
chalky
tasting
and
extremely
thin
bodied
as
well
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
something
along
the
lines
of
terrapin
wnb
with
this
one
and
it
just
didnt
come
anywhere
near
stacking
up
i
have
enjoyed
other
offerings
from
good
people
but
this
is
by
far
the
worst
thing
i
have
tried
from
them
to
date
most
definatly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
smooth
flavorful
and
balanced
aroma
creamy
vanilla
coffee
malty
chocolate
taste
light
coffee
cocoa
cocoa
rock
solid
look
and
smell
with
coffee
clearly
dominating
the
profile
but
that
same
domination
in
the
taste
isnt
particularly
pleasant
and
comes
off
as
almost
artificial
the
mouth
feel
is
also
very
thin
and
watery
which
isnt
what
i
want
in
an
oatmeal
stout
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
highly
recommended
will
have
again
yummy
smooth
moderately
bitter
aftertaste
with
simulated
expresso
pours
deep
dark
brown
just
about
black
with
a
big
chocolate
head
aroma
is
dark
and
roasty
with
the
coffee
being
nice
and
present
chocolatey
oats
give
off
some
sugary
sweetness
and
closes
out
earthy
and
bitter
flavor
follows
suit
i
just
wish
they
could
have
lowered
the
dosage
of
hops
here
far
hoppier
than
i
enjoy
in
a
stout
personally
a
creamier
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
a
fantastic
stout
up
until
the
hops
assert
themselves
making
it
is
just
a
really
good
stout
for
me
that
said
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
less
an
issue
the
hops
become
had
a
taste
of
this
at
the
brewery
in
birmingham
with
the
boys
while
attending
barber
vintage
moto
fest
next
stop
dreamland
bbq
im
usually
not
a
big
stout
guy
but
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
however
i
feel
like
the
roasty
elements
bring
too
much
bitterness
good
but
not
outstanding
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
overall
a
delicious
satisfying
and
complex
experience
if
i
had
general
access
to
this
beer
i
would
probably
buy
it
at
least
a
couple
more
times
passable
local
offering
worth
trying
worth
sharing
and
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
o
nice
coffee
notes
and
super
drinkable
from
the
oat
smoothness
very
good
overall
decent
and
acceptable
though
not
outstanding
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
good
people
brewpub
and
was
impressed
admittedly
i
had
low
expectations
it
wasnt
life
changing
but
dependable
enough
for
me
to
buy
a
six
pack
the
next
day
unfortunately
the
bottled
version
is
much
too
carbonated
and
somewhat
overhopped
the
williamette
hops
are
more
apparent
than
the
coffee
by
a
wide
margin
and
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
shockingly
rough
for
an
oatmeal
stout
generally
prized
of
course
for
a
soft
yet
robust
chewiness
this
beer
is
certainly
off
the
mark
for
its
style
and
sadly
fails
carve
out
a
satisfying
niche
of
its
own
perhaps
worth
a
try
if
you
place
a
great
value
on
trying
new
things
it
is
not
a
complete
failure
but
neither
is
it
a
worthy
successor
to
its
esteemed
predecessors
fbs
sam
smith
oatmeal
stout
o
a
good
stout
but
somewhat
on
the
abrasive
side
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
sweetness
in
my
opinion
o
i
like
it
not
as
much
as
some
of
my
favorite
breakfast
coffee
stouts
like
wakenbake
and
fbs
but
i
will
definitely
make
sure
i
have
these
in
my
fridge
for
those
chilly
nights
very
reasonably
priced
too
o
its
good
and
its
solid
i
just
think
the
rating
is
a
bit
biased
towards
where
its
distributd
o
i
can
see
why
this
ones
so
popular
rich
and
robust
coffee
wakes
up
the
palette
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
o
good
people
brews
good
beer
this
is
a
good
example
good
enough
overall
this
was
really
good
well
worth
a
try
o
a
good
coffee
stout
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
group
cheers
oa
damn
good
stout
doesnt
lie
as
most
gp
brews
the
expected
notes
are
in
your
face
and
it
is
balanced
fairly
well
if
they
thickened
the
brew
it
would
be
exceptional
no
flaws
the
flavor
profile
was
perfect
the
overall
taste
seemed
to
improve
throughout
the
glass
some
aroma
was
lacking
it
belongs
near
the
top
of
the
southern
50
the
color
and
cascading
was
excellent
with
a
rich
head
the
malt
taste
was
not
overalls
complicated
either
it
finished
dry
but
still
had
a
hint
of
velvet
mouthfeel
o
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
ive
not
tried
anything
from
them
that
wasnt
awesome
o
my
favorite
of
gps
many
great
beers
overall
i
could
see
this
beer
being
perfect
on
a
cold
rainy
day
but
was
pretty
tasty
even
in
the
hot
alabama
summer
all
in
all
i
thought
it
was
fine
but
perhaps
i
didnt
think
as
highly
of
it
as
most
seem
to
smells
like
a
good
iced
coffee
tastes
even
better
strong
espresso
not
getting
much
oatmeal
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
with
a
nice
hoppy
kick
very
tasty
on
a
cold
day
cant
wait
to
see
this
canned
i
will
be
making
the
3h
trip
to
pick
more
up
another
good
brew
from
the
the
state
of
alabama
listed
as
a
coffee
oatmeal
stout
this
brew
fully
delivers
on
the
coffee
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
pours
with
a
good
one
finger
of
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
the
coffee
flavor
tends
to
overshadow
the
oatmeal
flavor
but
the
more
you
drink
it
the
better
it
gets
this
is
a
stout
with
a
bite
but
a
good
bite
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
good
fallwinter
type
beer
that
should
warm
anyones
taste
buds
visited
j
clydes
in
birmingham
and
had
a
chance
to
try
good
peoples
brew
took
the
chance
to
try
the
coffee
stout
that
was
on
tap
the
beer
poured
very
darkopaque
rich
with
a
creamy
head
decent
carbonation
the
scent
was
strong
coffeeespresso
aroma
with
a
nice
smack
of
hops
the
taste
had
even
more
coffee
that
was
fairly
well
balanced
with
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
good
decent
body
to
this
beer
probably
could
have
two
if
it
were
snowing
outside
but
on
hot
days
i
would
stay
away
i
lost
about
an
18
of
the
growler
and
a
good
bit
of
the
carbonation
in
transit
but
the
beer
itself
is
still
really
good
maybe
one
day
i
will
try
it
at
the
source
super
rich
dark
brown
almost
black
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
slow
and
leaves
beautiful
lace
the
smell
is
full
roasted
with
rich
coffee
notes
dominating
over
a
background
of
dark
cocoa
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
follows
the
nose
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
with
grassy
herbal
earthy
hop
notes
lingering
in
the
back
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
rich
thick
and
creamy
on
the
mouth
excellent
beer
a
great
beer
good
for
all
seasons
but
really
shines
when
the
weather
turns
to
crap
drinkability
is
nice
pretty
good
balance
a
touch
thindry
for
the
style
and
lacking
somewhat
in
complexity
a
decent
stout
that
the
glass
i
am
reviewing
was
free
has
not
altered
this
review
one
bit
i
think
the
same
of
this
beer
right
now
as
i
did
when
i
was
paying
for
pints
of
it
at
the
alcove
right
before
their
keg
on
hopslam
was
tapped
back
on
thursday
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
regularaka
nonimperial
stouts
that
ive
ever
had
overall
a
great
brew
for
those
who
really
love
stouts
hops
and
coffee
a
great
beer
enjoyed
this
tasty
drink
as
a
cask
conditioned
brew
at
el
reys
first
monday
firkin
along
with
some
delicious
steak
enchiladas
which
it
matched
well
with
looking
forward
to
tasting
and
reviewing
the
barrelaged
county
line
version
that
i
picked
up
this
weekend
d
this
beer
sat
pretty
heavy
on
me
all
in
all
i
thought
it
was
a
delicious
beer
an
excellent
representation
of
coffee
flavored
beers
the
sweetness
and
general
nature
of
this
beer
suggest
that
maybe
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
finish
the
night
on
taste
is
pretty
nice
but
a
bit
more
restrained
than
the
nose
was
still
good
presence
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roast
the
body
is
nice
and
somewhat
full
a
bit
creamy
and
it
really
serves
to
accentuate
the
beers
flavors
all
in
all
very
nicely
done
and
im
glad
those
guys
were
walking
around
with
this
stuff
thanks
again
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
coffee
is
there
and
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
tasty
abv
is
unnoticeable
should
be
easy
to
finish
off
this
growler
with
a
few
people
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
good
people
brews
overall
i
am
very
impressed
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
this
is
a
great
coffee
stout
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
or
from
this
brewery
as
i
ordered
it
on
a
whim
while
passing
through
birmingham
what
i
got
was
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
i
have
tried
and
now
i
look
forward
to
getting
my
hands
on
more
beer
from
good
people
brewing
overall
very
solid
and
just
a
very
very
good
coffee
beer
great
balance
and
rich
and
sweet
coffee
flavor
super
drinkable
had
this
beauty
on
tap
at
the
j
clyde
i
absolutely
love
everything
about
this
beer
made
with
primavera
coffee
there
is
no
beer
more
local
in
alabama
i
cannot
wait
until
they
are
capable
of
distributing
outside
of
the
state
this
is
the
best
stout
to
be
found
in
alabama
drinkability
i
love
the
smell
and
flavors
but
these
offerings
tend
to
come
out
a
little
lower
for
me
due
to
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
with
this
one
im
quite
impressed
and
would
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
of
it
if
i
had
the
opportunity
everything
that
you
might
have
been
hoping
for
when
you
took
your
first
smell
of
the
pint
comes
true
in
a
big
way
once
you
take
your
first
sip
there
is
a
balanced
brilliance
to
this
stout
that
leaves
you
wondering
why
more
microbreweries
cannot
make
a
stout
as
nice
as
this
one
the
coffee
first
hits
the
taste
buds
in
a
big
way
and
the
coffee
highlights
the
quality
of
the
roast
used
in
the
brewing
process
as
there
is
not
the
slightest
hint
of
any
burnt
coffee
in
the
taste
there
is
a
sweetness
that
also
works
its
way
into
the
stout
behind
the
coffee
not
in
a
milk
stout
kind
of
way
but
rather
in
a
way
that
almost
perhaps
just
mentally
gives
the
impression
of
a
greater
creamy
nature
to
this
stout
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
rounds
out
the
taste
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastebuds
bud
still
a
tasty
take
on
the
style
the
strength
of
hops
character
in
a
brew
of
a
style
that
often
showcases
just
the
coffee
a
great
surprise
thanks
uj
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
tuscaloosa
although
a
coffee
oatmeal
is
not
an
english
style
this
beer
struck
me
as
having
a
very
english
stout
creamyness
that
was
very
pleasant
a
bit
light
on
the
carbonation
which
may
have
been
attributable
to
the
dispensing
system
coffee
flavor
was
not
overwhelming
and
the
maltyness
of
the
oatmeal
was
well
managed
d
wasnt
planning
on
2
pints
but
it
was
so
good
i
had
to
have
a
second
great
drinkability
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
coffee
stout
and
im
intrigued
by
good
peoples
other
offerings
worth
a
shot
one
of
my
favorites
beautiful
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
lovely
fine
brown
head
of
foam
that
left
nice
rings
of
belgian
lace
in
the
glass
the
nose
was
upfront
coffee
oats
and
chocolate
the
tasted
started
with
a
fine
mix
of
coffee
and
velvety
oatsdark
chocolate
malt
breakfast
anyone
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
to
malt
not
overly
carbonated
and
very
easy
to
drink
such
a
great
beer
pours
a
deep
black
with
tan
head
nose
starts
out
with
coffee
roastiness
etc
taste
is
great
deep
roasty
flavors
hints
of
coffee
and
semi
sweet
chocolate
oatmeal
lends
the
stout
a
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
truly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
beer
that
feels
every
bit
as
good
as
it
tastes
the
gp
coffee
oatmeal
stout
never
fails
to
wow
the
taste
buds
the
coffee
is
prominent
without
being
overbearing
the
oatmeal
lends
a
creamy
mouthfeel
to
the
beverage
the
malt
balances
out
with
the
bitterness
of
both
the
hops
and
coffee
with
no
element
overwhelming
another
an
excellent
session
beer
you
will
no
doubt
feel
a
bit
perkier
for
having
selected
it
growler
picked
up
from
dees
package
and
consumed
with
some
family
and
friends
within
a
couple
of
hours
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
that
starts
out
pretty
nice
and
fades
to
a
thick
ring
some
lacing
in
the
nose
there
is
lots
of
coffee
up
front
some
roastiness
and
lots
of
bitterness
no
cream
in
this
coffee
this
is
black
all
the
way
baby
the
taste
is
similar
with
lots
of
stronf
black
coffee
to
start
then
a
deep
roasty
bitterness
quite
intense
and
the
effect
is
make
this
taste
a
good
deal
stronger
than
it
actually
is
its
actually
got
a
little
too
much
coffee
taste
in
my
book
too
much
to
really
appreciate
any
of
the
silkiness
from
the
oatmeal
or
pick
up
other
nuances
still
im
impressed
with
my
first
taste
of
a
good
peoples
brew
ill
definitely
be
trying
more
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
the
good
folks
from
alabama
just
want
their
hops
to
be
freed
i
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
a
limit
on
the
abv
especially
as
low
as
a
6
cap
just
terrible
good
luck
to
you
in
your
quest
and
continue
to
make
quality
brews
such
as
this
d
i
am
kind
of
picky
when
it
comes
to
stouts
this
one
not
only
had
me
going
the
entire
time
but
i
also
went
on
a
walk
to
get
another
sample
as
soon
as
my
first
was
about
gone
i
would
drink
this
as
a
semiregular
if
i
could
get
it
here
very
good
beer
if
given
the
opportunity
i
would
love
gpbc
to
brew
an
imperial
version
as
a
seasonal
d
less
drinkable
than
your
typical
oatmeal
stout
but
thats
because
this
thing
is
suped
up
with
coffee
and
flavor
definitely
one
to
sip
on
rather
than
gulp
down
however
if
they
amped
the
body
up
a
bit
it
might
feel
more
like
a
sipper
alas
when
the
abv
cap
is
lowered
in
this
state
they
can
up
the
malt
and
alcohol
still
an
enjoyable
beer
that
went
very
well
after
my
meal
the
beer
pours
up
with
a
nice
thick
head
the
color
of
coffee
and
cream
the
smell
is
thick
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
taste
delivers
on
the
roasted
malt
promise
i
got
in
the
aroma
the
taste
of
coffee
is
very
strong
and
plays
nicely
with
the
malt
character
a
surprising
dose
of
hop
bitterness
comes
in
behind
and
clears
the
palette
making
this
a
very
quaffable
beer
despite
the
coffee
taste
i
think
this
stout
would
make
a
terrific
night
cap
d
well
the
only
negative
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
heavier
in
this
stout
still
that
helps
this
beer
in
the
drinkability
category
because
it
doesnt
sit
heavy
at
all
and
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
stouts
i
have
ever
encountered
its
simple
but
still
damned
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
good
job
goes
out
to
the
folks
at
good
people
hopefully
they
keep
it
up
and
keep
making
some
damn
good
brew
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
opaque
and
looks
a
little
thin
smells
pretty
good
a
little
coffee
aroma
but
well
balanced
with
bitter
chocolate
hints
first
sip
and
i
was
hooked
great
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
general
consensus
is
this
is
as
close
as
terrapin
wake
n
bake
as
an
alabamian
can
purchase
inside
state
lines
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
very
enjoyable
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
you
could
drink
this
all
night
great
beer
while
sitting
under
the
heaters
on
an
unusually
cold
alabama
october
night
seek
this
out
no
telling
how
long
it
will
last
echoing
some
sentiment
hopefully
this
will
become
a
staple
in
the
good
people
stable
d
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
a
great
offering
and
hopefully
this
will
be
a
gpbc
regular
if
you
like
coffee
or
you
like
stouts
try
this
beer
outstandingly
good
but
then
the
hops
hit
you
glorious
willamette
coffee
on
the
front
end

this
is
an

drinking
stout
because
its
relatively
lightbodied
for
the

and

5barney
flats
oatmeal
stout
is
recommended
for
dessert
but
breakfast
sounds
more
like
it
i
mean
really
d
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
but
enjoyable
and
goes
down
very
easily
i
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
rounded
out
overall
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
i
think
this
gives
style
benchmarks
like
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
a
run
for
their
money
much
more
flavor
than
i
am
used
to
in
oatmeal
stouts
and
i
love
it
definitely
pick
this
one
up
drinkability
you
could
drink
all
night
until
it
catches
up
to
you
this
goes
down
extremely
smooth
barney
flats
is
an
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
its
not
overly
complex
but
sometimes
thats
a
good
thing
overall
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
it
just
lacks
the
body
im
looking
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
everything
else
receives
great
marks
in
my
book
i
am
very
willing
to
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
great
beer
anderson
valley
brewing
overall
not
bad
this
is
a
fairly
good
stout
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
i
would
love
to
get
the
chance
to
try
it
on
tap
overall
a
relatively
flavorful
oatmeal
stout
with
a
decent
look
and
feel
a
bolder
nose
and
a
bit
of
lacing
would
help
this
one
in
the
ratings
but
nevertheless
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
thick
dense
tan
head
dark
brown
color
with
faint
mahogany
highlights
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
big
malty
aroma
with
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
very
sweet
roasted
body
mild
carbonation
flavor
also
has
some
caramel
with
the
smooth
malty
sweetness
not
much
bitterness
to
this
one
would
guess
that
would
be
th
oatmeal
at
work
mild
to
moderate
dryness
in
the
finish
overall
flavor
is
mild
but
an
easy
drinker
wife
likes
it
so
i
would
recommend
it
for
those
who
dont
like
a
super
intense
stout
that
would
weigh
on
the
side
being
very
coffee
or
roasted
influenced
if
you
like
oatmeal
stouts
buy
this
you
will
not
regret
it
a
clerk
at
panchos
liquor
town
in
okc
turned
me
onto
this
and
i
cannot
let
it
go
an
excellent
stout
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
again
soon
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
stout
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
d
nice
flavorful
session
beer
around
the
fire
replace
your
friends
guinness
with
this
not
as
bitter
and
goes
down
smoother
many
porter
fans
will
enjoy
this
selection
too
d
very
flavorful
and
smooth
not
really
filling
thought
feels
like
a
really
big
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
mellow
and
not
trying
too
hard
to
emphasize
the
oatmeal
aspect
it
is
mellow
enough
that
it
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
higher
abv
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
stout
definitely
like
it
a
lot
d
great
showing
from
anderson
valley
nothing
beats
a
sam
smiths
but
this
is
a
beer
that
holds
its
own
i
would
definitely
make
this
a
goto
brunch
beer
to
have
with
a
late
breakfast
like
pancakes
good
oatmeal
stout
from
a
bottle
beer
itself
was
smooth
and
did
not
have
a
major
kick
to
it
like
some
other
outmeal
stouts
have
had
got
a
sample
in
a
maryland
beer
shop
for
1
29
was
well
worth
it
would
not
think
twice
on
buying
a
6
or
a
12
pack
of
the
stuff
this
here
is
one
smooth
tasting
stout
the
appearance
is
black
smell
is
chocolatey
taste
is
again
chocolatewa
lightly
burnt
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
just
fine
while
its
in
there
then
right

hatch
it
goes

that
nice
stout
man
i
like
that
and
the
price
was
right

thank
ya
there
ol
barney
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
there
was
alot
of
love
put
into
this
beer
easy
drinking
however
fruit
taste
is
not
that
overpowering
but
dominant
md
medium
body
very
smooth
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
would
have
liked
a
stronger
nose
and
a
heavier
hand
with
the
oats
but
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
yeah
mild
and
enjoyable
enough
stout
ive
had
more
interesting
oatmeal
stouts
though
d
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
would
make
a
good
dessert
not
over
the
top
sweet
thanks
to
the
roastiness
verdict
great
stout
but
somewhat
onedimensional
worth
trying
for
sure
though
thumbs
up
try
it
out
side
note
although
this
is
a
good
beer
i
feel
its
a
touch
overpriced
at
14sixer
lots
of
other
stout
options
out
there
that
are
as
good
or
better
for
the
price
this
one
just
seems
a
touch
steep
good
beer
though
its
an
extremely
sessionable
stout
which
is
a
property
thats
often
overlooked
in
the
style
it
has
character
to
keep
it
interesting
it
might
be
a
little
gentle
and
thin
genrewise
but
its
a
more
drinkable
beer
for
it
a
good
stout
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
just
an
easy
to
drink
stout
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
something
i
would
recommend
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
bit
of
a
bit
of
a
dark
tan
head
nose
brings
forward
a
good
amount
of
roasted
malt
a
tad
bit
of
smoke
molasses
and
hints
of
coffee
the
roast
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
which
is
really
enhanced
by
the
really
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
this
brings
forward
drinks
really
well
and
is
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
i
would
buy
this
again
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
of
cooled
porridge
taste
is
a
hint
of
fresh
nutmeg
up
front
with
a
sweetened
chocolate
milk
middle
and
a
raw
oatmeal
finish
a
hint
of
leafy
hops
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
quite
luscious
low
lively
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
very
good
mouthfeel
though
not
heavy
at
all
very
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
notes
very
tasty
robust
and
hearty
cheers

no

the

was

the

wanted

as

nailed
it
anderson

barney
flats
oatmeal
stout
it
has
a
wonderful
dark
brown
coffee
pour
the
head
is
thin
but
a
great
toffee
caramel
color
the
nose
is
bitter
but
there
is
still
a
pleasant
smell
of
coffee
and
hops
the
hops
is
most
certainly
where
the
bitterness
is
coming
from
it
has
a
real
bold
burnt
smoky
taste
it
has
defiantly
been
americanized
with
some
hops
and
bold
robust
overthetop
flavors
i
wouldnt
mind
if
it
was
toned
down
a
little
its
one
of
those
beers
that
could
be
drank
for
breakfast
or
with
some
green
black
organic
chocolate
after
dinner
aroma
is
strong
and
very
smoky
almost
like
charcoal
with
hints
of

and
molasses
it
pours
a
nice
deep
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
too
persistent
light
tan
head
flavor
is
rather
like
a
quality
mocha
smoky
with
tones
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
just
a
whisper
of
molasses
sweetness
texture
is
very
smooth
and
just
a
little
tingly
as
has
been
my
experience
in
most
cases
ontap
is
better
still
its
pretty
good
in
a
bottle
drinkability
is
fantastic
abv
is
modest
for
a
oatmeal
stout
of
this
flavor
not
to
mention
it
has
a
great
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
good
job
anderson

d
very
nice
stuff
here

substantial
complementary
with

what
more
could
you
ask
for
fairly
low
alcohol
5
7
for
a
fullbodied
stout
would
make
a
good
session
beer
d
a
simple
yet
very
tasty
stout
ill
be
buying
more
this
winter
this
is
my
final
beer
from
this
brewery
so
hopefully
ive
saved
the
best
til
lastit
pours
a
jet
black
as
night
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
mocha
laced
one
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
of
this
beer
is
a
mix
of
aromas
of
smokey
chocolatedark
expresso
and
some
underlying
fruity
bitter
hopsit
has
a
nice
sessionable
mouthfeel
which
is
abit
lighter
than
i
expected
but
netherless
suits
this
brew
and
has
nice
tastes
of
coccoamocharoasty
malts
and
finishes
with
a
beautiful
bittersweet
taste
of
caramel
fruity
hopsoverall
if
this
beer
was
abit
cheaper
and
more
readily
available
to
me
it
would
have
a
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
even
though
its
not
the
most
complex
or
best
ever
oatmeal
stout
ive
tried
i
quite
like
it
and
could
drink
it
all
night
t
just
like
the
scent
the
smoke
hits
the
tongue
right
away
and
is
followed
by
a
coffee
sourness
in
the
back
very
nice
mix
fine
attempt
at
an
oatmeal
drinkability
solid
i
would
have
this
again
definitly
the
lower
abv
of
this
stout
plays
to
its
advantage
because
it
makes
it
easy
to
have
a
few
but
i
think
it
might
also
be
hurting
it
by
taking
away
a
bit
of
the
taste
that
could
have
been
there
a
good
stout
but
not
quite
fantastic
d
awesome
this
is
a
great
beer
to
keep
around
nothing
too
crazy
just
a
good
drinker
d
very
drinkable
definitely
would
have
another
and
i
may
make
it
a
point
to
go
back
and
get
a
sixer
of
this
very
very
good
d
wow
this
stout
was
very
very
good
to
me
it
was
almost
like
a
dessert
stout
with
the
extremely
rich
dark
chocolate
flavors
but
its
balanced
by
a
good
smokiness
as
well
very
drinkable
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
after
a
long
days
work
highly
recommended
cheers
great
oatmeal
stout
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
very
enjoyable
dpretty
good
overall
i
just
thought
it
would
be
a
little
beefier
in
body
than
what
i
tasted
still
a
very
nice
stout
a
very
nice
offering
from
anderson

ill
be
sure
and
pick
this
up
again
comments
excellent
just
excellent
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
was
a
longtime
treat
of
mine
in
the
evenings
or
for
sunday
breakfasts
but
this
one
is
just
a
step
above
enough
to
convince
me
to
review
it
as
a
first
beer
i
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
but
this
definitely
struck
a
chord
in
a
way
other
similar
beers
in
the
past
two
years
of
drinking
havent
take
that
for
what
you
will
d
if
you
like
good
stouts
this
one
is
definitely
a
good
one
for
you
very
drinkable
muted
flavors
that
arent
weak
but
still
tasty
enough
to
get
you
going
i
like
this
one
a
lot
pours
to
a
thick
dark
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
could
be
my
glass
to
blame
with
a
dark
nearly
opaque
rubyblack
color
aroma
is
spoton
very
roasty
with
hints
of
oatmeal
vanilla
caramel
chocolate
and
butter
flavor
is
not
as
intense
as
i
hoped
but
not
really
bad
coffee
sweet
malt
and
enough
hops
to
balance
out
what
the
roasted
grains
do
not
some
chalkyminerallike
quality
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
gassy
overall
impression
delivers
an
intense
yet
superior
look
and
smell
with
a
lessimpressive
yet
solid
flavor
finish
and
feel
one
of
the
easierdrinking
oatmeal
dark
ales
ive
tasted
i
think
they
should
increase
the
grain
bill
maybe
add
some
more
base
malt
to
boost
the
gravity
and
add
roasted
barleysomething
not
mentioned
on
the
ingredient
list
on
the
label
is
that
an
oversight
if
it
really
has
no
roasted
nonmalted
barley
shouldnt
it
be
called
an
oatmeal
porter
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
great
chocolate
nose
and
flavor
on
the
other
hand
the
oatmeal
i
got
was
on
the
aroma
but
that
ok
it
was
still
a
good
beer
almost
a
meal
in
and
of
itself
this
one
is
different
with
the
fruits
taking
on
a
life
of
their
own
which
creates
balance
issues
but
thats
just
my
opion
so
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
barney
flats
oatmeal
stout
is
a
stout
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytimefor
desert
on
a
winter
evening
or
strangely
enough
on
a
hot
active
day
good
beer
well
balanced
and
a
easy
drinker
def
worth
seeking
out
and
i
would
do
so
again
overall
wow
i
feel
i
am
doing
this
beer
an
injustice
trying
to
place
words
to
its
harmonious
grandeur
this
is
a
beautifully
crafted
oatmeal
stout
that
is
well
balanced
full
of
flavor
yet
not
overpowering
delicate
enough
to
please
nearly
any
palate
this
is
a
beer
that
can
complement
a
hearty
meals
dessert
or
stand
alone
do
yourself
a
favor
and
treat
your
mouth
to
this
gem
d
frankly
boring
but
nothing
actually
bad
about
it
medium
bodied
medium
effervescence
somewhat
warming
a
good
solid
brew
consistent
with
their
other
offerings
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
offering
be
sure
to
let
it
warm
and
enjoy
the
experience
a
good
beer
i
am
more
partial
to
heavier
stouts
with
more
coffee
taste
to
them
but
non
the
less
it
is
worth
drinking
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
from
a
bottle
and
its
a
black
beer
with
good
color
with
the
head
the
head
has
a
darker
caramel
color
and
is
good
size
about
two
fingers
the
pouring
was
easy
and
smooth
the
smell
is
great
it
smelled
like
candy
the
mouth
feel
was
hearty
and
covers
the
tongue
it
fells
like
how
a
stout
should
feel
the
taste
could
have
scored
higher
but
i
probably
just
had
my
expectations
a
little
high
it
doesnt
taste
bad
by
any
means
its
good
and
would
do
well
with
a
desert
i
like
its
slight
chocolate
notes
the
aftertaste
was
a
bitter
sweet
finish
that
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
would
have
scored
higher
but
i
am
biased
and
i
am
particular
about
my
stouts
but
overall
still
a
good
beer
thanks

to
enjoy
after
dinner
with
dessert
and
since
it
isnt
as
thick
as
most
stouts
you
dont
have
to
save
room
to
fit
it
all
in
the
abv
isnt
that
strong
here
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
easygoing
stouts
of
any
kind
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
id
rather
have
this
when
the
leaves
are
turning
but
no
matter
this
is
good
choice
for
someone
who
likes
darker
beers
that
arent
too
thin
and
too
spicy
or
heavy
once
again
having
a
west
coast
beer
distributed
here
in
the
east
is
the
benefit
of
any
beer
lover
like
myself
d
a
good
tasting
oatmeal
stout
nice
drinkability
good
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
amazing
beer
d
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
that
go
down
easy
another
good
anderson
valley
beer
nice
accompaniment
for
a
game
of
darts
when
snowed
in
at
a
small
bar
in
the
mountains
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
im
tasting
this
sidebyside
with
another
oatmeal
stout
that
i
greatly
enjoy
pours
black
with
an
attractive
brown
head
aromas
are
predominately
roasty
with
a
dark
chocolate
element
in
there
as
well
this
beer
is
fullbodied
and
robust
with
big
roasty
flavors
up
front
that
slowly
unfold
into
sweeter
notes
of
cocoa
and
toffee
barney
flats
is
superb
a
mighty
fine
oatmeal
stout
a
benchmark
for
this
style
at
least
american
interpretations
d
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
was
expecting
more
coffee
and
oatmeal
in
the
taste
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
sessionable
beer
for
sure
solid
solid
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
deasy
drinking
and
nice
body
good
flavors
and
a
nice
blend
of
complexity
the
body
wasnt
overly
full
but
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
the
carbonation
was
light
and
unobtrusive
the
thing
that
really
turned
me
on
to
this
one
was
the
flavor
at
the
end
of
my
12
ounces
i
still
havent
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
intrigues
me
and
i
like
whatever
theyve
done
here
d
this
is
a
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
the
flavors
work
together
very
nicely
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
never
becomes
too
heavy
and
the
low
abv
allows
you
to
have
three
or
four
of
these
taste
is
mellow
but
firm
consistent
and
even
with
good
depth
and
range
of
character
it
has
a
lot
of
oatmeal
prune
brown
bread
some
rootbeer
hints
and
anise
a
light
sweetness
just
dominates
the
light
bitterness
it
has
a
good
feel
slightly
on
the
oily
side
it
is
highly
drinkable
dvery
good
while
perhaps
not
a
session
beer
very
smooth
tasty
easy
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
havent
had
many
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
really
liked
this
beer
12
oz
bottle
to
glass
pours
a
tall
tan
head
good
retention
not
much
smell
when
i
first
poured
dark
molasses
color
very
flavorful
but
not
over
the
top
there
is
a
sweetness
creaminess
and
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
like
cream
and
sugar
in
really
black
coffee
love
the
tangy
roast
flavor
some
caramel
the
smell
starts
coming
around
after
it
warms
a
bit
very
similar
to
the
taste
rich
roasted
coffee
smells
fairly
creamy
but
doesnt
coat
actually
finishes
somewhat
dry
highly
recommended
d
drinkability
would
be
very
high
if
not
for
the
mildly
distracting
aftertaste
overall
its
weak
in
terms
of
taste
and
the
diacetyl
overwhelms
the
true
oatmeal
stout
characteristics
that
could
be
there
easy
drinkability
but
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
dark
black
almost
color
body
average
frothy
diminishing
sweet
oatmeal
chocolate
aroma
some
dusty
hops
maybe
creamy
body
some
almost
burnt
coffee
aftertaste
chocolately
oatmeal
taste
chalky
chocolate
mouthfeel
pretty
good
a
little
cigarette
ash
taste
as
it
warms
more
not
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
something
i
would
consider
ordering
on
tap
if
i
saw
while
out
visiting
the
pubs
overall
i
would
rather
drink
swampheads
stubbies
swamp
stout
but
not
because
its
better
because
its
local
i
would
put
them
to
be
just
about
equal
with
each
having
different
strengths
and
weaknesses
resonates
throughout
never
diminishes
throughout
its
life
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
wanna
watch
a
guy
be
indecisive
tell
me
i
can
only
have
one
this
or
sammy
smiths
oatmeal
stout
update
have
had
this
many
times
since
and
i
like
it
more
and
more
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
cant
get
enough
of
it
d
kind
of
a
let
down
after
a
strong
start
not
bad
by
any
means
but
simply
run
of
the
mill
for
me
light
body
might
help
in
some
situations
but
this
isnt
very
satisfying
for
a
bitter
cold
winter
night
d
not
too
heavy
so
a
nice
stout
for
capping
off
a
big
meal
this
was
not
good
which
shocked
me
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
as
the
vast
majority
of
reviews
of
this
beer
are
very
high
i
have
one
bottle
remaining
but
that
could
be
old
as
well
guess
ill
have
to
wait
and
see
if
i
ever
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
sample
and
then
see
what
i
think
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
a
few
of
with
friends
very
smooth
and
drinkable
an
accompaniment
to
samuel
smith
as
the
best
of
the
oatmeal
stouts
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
black
as
a
moonless
night
no
light
shines
through
small
bubbly
head
that
quickly
transforms
into
a
thin
film
with
very
good
lacing
the
taste
i
love
not
your
typical
oatmeal
stout
at
all
a
sweet
flavor
with
just
the
hint
of
bitterness
caramel
or
toffee
flavors
this
brew
makes
my
mouth
happy
velvety
smooth
highly
drinkable
a
damn
good
beer
anderson
valley
hits
the
mark
with
a
stout
that
should
appeal
to
a
wide
variety
since
it
is
not
overly
sweet
i
wish
this
was
available
in
bottles
in
texas
taste
is
pretty
much
as
i
described
in
the
nose
lightly
roasted
malts
and
some
floral
hops
crisp
clean
refreshing
but
not
really
standing
out
to
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
very
nice
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
this
is
definitely
a
smooth
session
stout
but
session
stouts
arent
really
my
thing
so
i
rated
accordingly
d
this
is
a
big
beer
with
a
low
abv
highly
drinkable
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
drinkability
very
much
so
this
was
an
after
dinner
beer
both
my
buddy
and
i
had
and
we
both
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
will
be
looking
for
this
at
my
local
beer
store
very
impressed
with
it
appropriately
thick
with
enough
carbonation
for
emphasis
but
not
for
pain
its
more
drinkable
than
average
for
a
beer
of
this
gravitas
but
the
important
part
is
to
remember
that
is
indeed
has
substance
drinkability
take
it
slow
and
enjoy
a
little
bit
lighter
bodied
than
i
expected
this
is
by
no
means
a
light
bodied
beer
i
can
still
call
it
fuller
bodied
but
it
has
enough
thinness
to
aid
in
the
drinkability
a
very
smooth
brew
with
sip
or
mouthful
capabilities
id
return
to
this
again
conclusion
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
it
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
and
a
more
substantial
body
but
it
remains
a
solid
player
nonetheless
as
a
sidenote
this
beer
on
tap
mixed
with
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
was
absolutely
fantastic
one
of
the
few
mixed
beers
i
enjoy
drinkability
a
solidly
drinkable
stout
this
brew
has
some
really
high
quality
characteristics
i
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
all
stout
fans
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
cause
im
looking
forward
to
a
few
more
dark
black
with
clam
shell
colored
head
very
sweet
roasty
nose
tastes
include
plain
oatmeal
vanilla
cinnamon
and
a
small
amount
of
very
dark
chocolate
smooth
velvety
texture
and
a
very
attractive
beer
from
the
tap
i
would
say
it
stands
up
there
in
the
upper
echelon
of
low
abv
oatmeal
stouts
if
you
like
this
style
make
sure
you
try
it
drinkability
very
smooth
wow
what
a
fantastic
beer
d
a
rock
solid
brew
that
is
very
approachable
to
all
beer
drinkers
not
overly
complex
but
extremely
enjoyable
as
an
everyday
staple
beer
i
can
easily
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
the
fridge
if
this
was
a
local
brew
not
a
must
try
but
certainly
a
brew
you
can
rely
on
and
one
you
can
enjoy
with
a
pretty
wide
audience
easily
drinkable
remarkably
enjoyable
this
brew
is
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
at
any
point
in
the
day
simple
and
sweet
a
shining
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
is
exceptional
it
is
not
an
overpowering
cloying
stou
so
having
a
couple
is
not
a
problem
notes
bbcsd0908danm
pours
a
dark
almost
cola
color
with
reddish
brownish
highlights
and
an
off
white
two
finger
head
that
gives
way
to
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
oats
and
roasted
nuts
as
well
as
a
very
small
earthy
hop
note
the
taste
is
of
an
oat
backbone
the
over
the
top
taste
is
of
roasted
nuts
and
of
chocolate
and
a
slight
coffee
flavor
there
is
a
very
faint
earthy
hop
taste
on
the
back
end
of
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
is
silky
but
not
slick
the
overall
drinkability
is
very
high
you
can
enjoy
this
beer
over
and
over
again
d
one
of
the
finest
oatmeal
stouts
around
this
made
for
a
great
morning
brew
at
11am
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
brewery
tour
to
begin
d
a
good
beer
but
there
is
nothing
here
that
makes
me
feel
like
i
need
more
than
one
of
these
the
malt
character
is
nice
but
not
especially
interesting
and
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
hurts
the
drinkability
because
it
is
not
balanced
by
any
real
bitterness
from
malt
or
hops
worth
trying
as
a
single
but
i
am
glad
i
didnt
get
a
six
pack
of
this
d
very
good
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
will
purchase
again
i
would
describe
this
beer
as
somewhat
robust
for
the
style
almost
has
porterlike
qualities
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
with
oats
and
molasses
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
does
have
a
creamy
type
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
palate
a
little
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
but
it
was
a
good
beer
i
tried
it
twice
and
the
foregoing
was
consistent
both
times
perhaps
i
was
poured
from
a
bad
keg
i
dont
know
i
do
know
that
this
beer
was
less
than
impressive
but
is
it
just
me
or
is
oatmeal
stout
not
supposed
to
be
so
dry
i
always
think
about
the
smooth
slickness
of
the
sam
smith
as
the
standard
for
the
style
i
liked
it
but
it
certainly
doesnt
go
down
as
easy
as
the
ss
or
the
wolavers

overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
oatmeal
stout
i
would
really
love
to
drink
this
regularly
than
the
one
that
i
experienced
a
very
good
stout
not
very
sweet
but
not
too
bitter
the
coffee
roastiness
is
restrained
in
this
beer
allowing
the
oats
to
shine
through
very
nice
in
cooler
weather
id
drink
one
after
another
without
complaint
in
this
heat
the
heaviness
is
a
bit
much
but
im
the
one
drinking
an
oatmeal
stout
in
florida
in
june
cant
fault
the
beer
for
that
d
id
call
this
a
dessert
beer
too
much
of
this
would
its
special
quality
meant
for
moderation
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
roasted
oats
and
barley
with
hints
of
chocolate
cocoa
nibs
and
hops
i
truly
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
wonderful
beer
nice
creamy
balance
of
chocolate
with
just
a
slight
hop
bitterness
after
taste
of
dark
chocolate
not
much
carbonation
just
nice
creamy
choclate
oat
taste
this
was
my
first
offering
from
anderson
valley
and
it
really
blew
me
away
a
nice
highly
drinkable
stout
taste
is
semiwatery
bitter
sweet
chocolate
some
coffee
a
touch
of
roasted
nuts
slightly
sour
oats
and
some
vanilla
end
is
somewhat
dry

nicely
bitter
pours
very
thick
dark

aggressive

an
absolutely
massive
head
not
a
ton
in
the
way
of
lacing
though
smells
pleasant
big
yeasty
smell
lots
of
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
coffee
taste
is
a
pleasant
balance
between
roastiness
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
coffee
roastiness
doesnt
overwhelm
and
its
more
sweet
than
anything
normally
sweet
stouts
arent
my
thing
but
it
works
here
nice
and
creamy
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
heft
behind
the
body
not
quite
watery
but
not
as
much
gravity
as
i
would
like
very
drinkable
though
excellent
for
a
hot
day
when
you
dont
want
a
very
thick
stout
the
lightness
combined
with
great
flavors
that
open
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
combined
with
the
lower
abv
makes
this
a
great
if
not
one
of
the
best
sessionable
stout
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
cheers

this
was
a
great
extra
sent
my
way
by
washburnkid
thanks
judy
i
decided
to
rank
this
one
higher
having
tried
some
of
the
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
definitely
have
a
better
understanding
of
what
this
beer
style
is
all
about
and
it
meets
the
criteria
beautifully
drinkability
is
very
high
i
would
have
no
problem
sessioning
this
beer
and
given
the
availability
and
price
probably
will
in
the
near
future
d
easy
and
filling
i
want
to
drink
this
for
breakfast
over
and
over
this
brewery
is
excellent
md
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
with
a
refreshing
feel
easily
drinkable
d
oh
of
course
it
goes
down
so
easy
really
a
tasty
beer
that
id
recommend
to
just
about
anyone
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
very
good
i
could
drink
these
like
crazy
hv
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
thin
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
very
dark
letting
very
little
light
get
through
hint
of
cherry
color
smells
of
smoked
molasses
and
oats
tastes
like
sweet
molasses
which
i
enjoy
oatsof
coursechicory
possibly
mouthful
is
dry
not
really
syrupy
mildly
carbonated
and
acidic
i
could
drink
my
normal
2
in
2
hours
drinkability
nothing
too
impressive
here
overall
very
bland
and
watery
and
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
a
proper
stout
this
evening
d
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
nice
moderate
abv
really
a
fine
beverage
the
beer
is
very
smooth
maybe
a
touch
watery
but
it
has
that
unmistakeable
silkiness
that
comes
from
the
oatmeal
there
arent
any
burnt
or
charred
flavors
in
this
stout
it
is
all
about
fine
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
malts
that
chocolate
cherry
flavor
that
is
so
enjoyable
and
a
touch
of
hop
in
the
finish
the
beer
does
not
have
any
prickliness
to
it
it
is
all
creamy
and
smooth
at
5
7
abv
this
is
eminently
drinkable
beyond
the
first
the
beer
has
some
carbonation
not
much
but
it
isnt
overly
flat
or
lacking
any
efforvescence
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
drinkability
is
ok
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
so
the
drinkability
factor
drops
considerably
for
me
lots
of
coffee
flavors
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
the
flavor
is
extensive
and
makes
up
for
any
lightness
in
the
body
the
aftertaste
is
almost
chewylike
the
aftereffects
of
a
coffee
ice
cream
overall
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
super
complex
and
sophisticated
in
taste
and
texture
this
beer
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
very
thin
brown
headthin
film
of
head
is
retained
throughout
lacing
at
first
was
minimal
and
then
left
a
nice
coating
on
the
side
of
the
glass
nose
is
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
some
bitter
coffeeespresso
and
on
the
tail
end
some
sweetness
caramel
malts
taste
is
very
inline
with
the
nose
bitterness
of
the
coffeeespresso
is
up
front
definite
roasted
malts
on
the
tongue
finishes
up
more
sweet
here
come
the
caramel
malts
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
but
with
high
carbonation
if
i
could
make
one
change
on
this
beer
it
would
be
to
lighten
up
the
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sit
with
certainly
for
a
session
i
tried
this
one
out
since
it
knocked
off
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
bells
kalamazoo
in
the
washington
post
beer
madness
not
sure
whether
id
pick
it
over
that
one
but
still
a
fine
specimen
relatively
viscous
at
first
then
perked
up
by
mild
acidity
and
prickly
carbonation
that
then
quickly
backs
off
great
stuff
my
top
oatmeal
stout
this
is
always
in
my
fridge
without
exception
i
cant
suggest
it
to
people
more
strongly
very
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
smooth
body
very
representative
of
its
style
i
think
anderson
valley
hit
this
one
right
on
the
head
more
sweet
that
bitter
it
tastes
of
vanilla
with
mild
sugary
roast
odd
sour
hop
oil
notes
here
and
there
that
dont
really
fit
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
full
drinkability
this
is
actually
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
being
available
individually
for
around
4
00
a
bottle
at
my
local
bar
its
one
i
turn
to
when
im
in
the
mood
and
could
drink
a
few
of
before
im
through
d
im
glad
i
was
sharing
the
22oz
bomber
because
it
wasnt
good
enough
to
me
to
finish
but
it
was
somewhat
pleasant
d
nice
sweet
stout
overall
wouldnt
mind
another
and
im
willing
to
bet
this
is
hella
better
fresh
overall
great
stout
this
is
my
favourite
type
of
stout
smooth
wellrounded
and
chocolaty
excellent
drinkability
easy
split
a
6
pack
with
a
friend
would
pick
it
up
again
sometime
especially
if
it
were
on
sale
taste
matches
the
nose
to
a
t
some
mild
floral
hops
make
an
appearance
on
the
back
end
its
creamy
and
highly
sessionable
i
like
it
one
of
the
best
oatystouts
i
have
had
overall
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
and
am
extremely
glad
that
i
decided
on
a
whim
to
pick
up
the
sixer
that
i
did
i
think
i
might
have
even
mistaken
it
for
something
else
when
i
went
to
buy
it
and
i
can
unequivocally
say
that
it
was
a
fortunate
mistake
because
i
have
since
discovered
one
of
my
favourite
beers
as
of
this
writing
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
slightly
tart
dark
fruit
nutty
molasses
and
mocha
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
very
smooth
and
creamy
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
drinks
real
easy
though
the
price
tag
means
i
wont
drink
it
much
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
though
d
awesome
beer
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
pick
your
own
6
6pack
just
grabbed
it
because
i
saw
it
not
knowing
what
to
expect
wow
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
it
is
not
too
full
bodied
for
a
stout
but
it
has
a
good
consistency
to
it
it
def
is
not
too
thin
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
two
or
three
of
these
and
not
getting
too
full
id
def
recommend
grabbing
a
22
oz
if
you
can
good
drinkability
and
highly
recommended
d
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
lighter
weight
stout
although
low
alcohol
stouts
are
not
my
style
i
could
definitely
be
happy
with
this
one
for
a
night
future
outlook
yeah
ill
gladly
give
this
stuff
another
whirl
at
a
future
date
drinkability
relatively
smooth
yet
packed
with
flavor
for
a
low
abv
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
full
bodied
creamy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
mellow
example
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
black
color
13
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
oatmeal
sweetness
as
well
fits
the
style
of
an
oatmeal
stout
really
smooth
and
thick
mouth
feel
carbonation
level
is
average
and
the
bitterness
level
is
average
as
well
tastes
of
a
sweetness
up
front
from
the
oatmeal
and
chocolate
the
roasted
malts
come
through
in
the
middle
of
the
brew
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
is
apparent
in
the
finish
overall
a
smooth
beer
with
multiple
malt
flavors
throughout
too
expensive
to
buy
if
youre
not
in
california
this
is
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
but
its
far
from
exceptional
pony
up
for
sam
smith
if
youre
really
into
oatmeal
stout
or
try
something
else
flavors
are
kind
of
thin
not
as
thin
as
left
hand
milk
stout
though
this
is
a
legit
oatmeal
stout
smell
is
average
like
others
i
found
this
slightly
sweet
which
was
offputting
the
sweetness
though
like
so
much
about
this
stout
was
unobtrusive
this
is
a
beer
thats
hard
to
dislike
but
hard
to
really
get
excited
about
the
price
will
definitely
prevent
me
from
buying
it
again
but
if
youre
local
and
its
cheap
it
may
be
worthwhile
to
pick
up
but
if
thats
the
case
then
it
means
youre
passing
up
deschutes
black
butte
porter
or
obsidian
stout
both
of
which
are
superior
beers
go
with
those
this
beer
is
just
ok
d
ive
tried
these
3000
miles
and
6
months
apart
not
for
me
its
very
smooth
but
possibly
a
little
overcarbonated
not
as
thick
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
the
drinkability
as
a
result
is
way
up
there
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
also
not
one
i
would
like
by
itself
but
with
a
meal
i
would
drink
it
again
d
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
can
foresee
myself
picking
this
up
again
drinkability
very
nice
for
session
plenty
of
mellow
coffee
flavors
and
a
blended
taste
with
a
malt
base
and
a
late
kick
of
hops
for
an
exemplary
closing
balance
carbonation
is
suitably
low
the
texture
is
very
smooth
throughout
and
makes
sipping
extremely
effortless
this
is
a
stout
to
seek
out
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
stouts
there
is
a
perfect
balance
of
flavors
here
the
dark
chocolate
sweetness
balances
well
with
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavors
the
slight
bitterness
is
the
icing
on
the
cake
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
at
5
7
abv
i
should
be
able
to
walk
home
bubbly
one
to
two
finger
head
more
large
bubbles
than
small
when
they
pop
the
head
recedes
swiftly
attractive
brown
color
the
liquid
is
jet
black
only
hint
of
brown
or
orange
comes
at
the
outermost
rims
dark
roasted
coffee
chicory
and
bitters
and
then
dark
chocolate
dominate
the
nose
fair
amount
of
grape
apple
cherry
fruit
too
with
time
more
butterscotch
oatmeal
while
not
complex
grows
in
stature
with
each
sniff
and
resists
vacating
the
premises
fullbodied
the
high
level
of
carbonation
plus
the
overall
lack
of
sugariness
relieves
a
lot
of
downward
pressure
not
that
if
lifts
per
se
but
forward
movement
is
not
a
problem
flavorwise
the
roasted
coffee
heavy
cream
dark
chocolate
toffee
oatmeal
elements
charge
right
up
on
you
taking
this
into
consideration
isnt
malty
in
an
obvious
way
likewise
the
hops
act
more
like
a
sponge
at
the
end
as
anything
else
loses
thrust
and
followthrough
at
the
end
or
chooses
a
more
restrained
path
choose
your
own
description
but
you
do
want
to
fill
the
void
with
another
sip
above
average
drinkability
pours
out
a
deep
black
color
theres
a
kind
of
thin
tan
head
that
sits
around
for
a
little
while
leaving
some
lacing
looks
about
normal
the
smell
is
a
bit
subdued
you
get
a
subtle
sweetness
and
roasted
smell
that
come
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
really
great
theres
a
great
sweetness
from
the
oatmeal
but
its
not
all
sweetness
theres
a
great
roasted
bitterness
theres
kind
of
a
cocacola
taste
but
a
bit
more
complex
its
what
i
like
in
an
oatmeal
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
good
very
smooth
good
carbonation
good
balance
everything
worked
out
just
fine
in
this
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
loved
every
sip
everyone
should
get
this
if
they
can
d
keepem
coming
this
one
is
easy
and
a
go
to
beer
for
me
one
of
the
tastier
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
in
recent
i
would
not
have
a
problem
sipping
these
all
night
long
poured
a
dark
brown
body
almost
black
with
a
light
brown
head
and
minor
lacing
sweet
malts
in
the
smell
but
very
light
and
rather
airy
bland
smell
thick
mediumbody
with
minor
creaminess
but
good
smoothness
roasted
malts
along
with
some
sweet
malts
for
a
good
balance
and
the
oats
really
make
it
pass
easy
but
theres
still
a
good
dry
backbite
so
its
not
watery
i
could
keep
drinking
these
as
it
is
hard
to
put
the
glass
down
when
the
beer
is
so
pleasantly
smooth
and
packs
a
nice
punch
a
very
dark
pour
with
a
small
head
very
sweet
tasting
but
also
extremely
delicious
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
oatmeal
stout
has
become
of
my
my
favorite
styles
and
this
would
rank
up
there
with
one
of
the
best
i
have
tasted
would
recommend
as
either
a
dessert
beer
or
if
you
are
like
me
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
while
relaxing
and
watching
a
hockey
game
in
the
winter
drinkability
this
is
a
gorgeous
oatmeal
stout
maybe
the
best
ive
had
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
english
ris
way
more
flavorful
than
all
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
will
buy
again
poured
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
from
fridge
nice
black
color
with
pale
tan
head
of
about
1
finger
aroma
was
ok
a
bit
of
roast
a
bit
of
oats
kinda
grassy
with
the
oats
and
roast
growing
as
it
warmed
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
of
what
i
think
of
in
an
oatmeal
stout
chilled
as
it
warmed
it
felt
thicker
with
an
acceptable
feel
at
about
55f
cold
it
was
kinda
meh
not
much
there
in
the
way
of
oats
just
a
good
stout
as
it
warmed
the
oily
viscosity
and
taste
from
the
oat
appeared
but
alas
they
clashed
with
the
roastyness
i
think
the
roast
was
a
little
strong
and
it
clashed
from
my
thoughts
on
an
oatmeal
stout
it
was
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
not
a
creamy
rich
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
over
and
over
again
on
a
cold
night
perhaps
a
sample
on
tap
would
provide
a
more
positive
read
on
the
actuality
of
this
beer
a
very
sweet
version
of
a
stout
with
a
nice
chocolate
coffee
flavor
with
a
malted
smell
and
a
decent
hop
presence
on
the
back
end
one
of
the
few
great
sessionable
stouts
due
to
the
very
low
alcohol
content
its
refreshing
to
find
one
so
smooth
and
kind
of
lowkey
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
still
smooth
and
a
mild
biting
carbonation
fairly
solid
the
oats
make
themselves
known
from
the
outset
lending
an
incredible
maltiness
that
cannot
be
matched
by
malted
barley
alone
sweetness
grows
from
beneath
the
tongue
becoming
just
a
bit
syrupy
but
not
so
much
that
its
a
distraction
other
notes
of
dark
cherries
currants
and
of
bittersweet
chocolate
round
out
this
beer
making
it
a
wholly
enjoyable
and
exceptional
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
enjoy
the
next
time
im
here
d
drinkability
is
very
high
id
liked
it
so
much
that
i
am
not
sure
if
it
could
get
much
better
than
this
overall
got
to
be
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
tried
this
beer
has
a
good
malt
backbone
with
some
nice
smokey
light
burnt
sugar
overtones
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
with
a
bitter
finish
that
linger
very
nicely
on
the
palate
i
really
like
this
stout
it
is
well
made
taste
was
very
creamy
i
didnt
get
much
roasted
flavor
from
this
one
hint
of
chocolate
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
very
easy
drinker
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
but
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
a
session
its
not
overwhelming
or
rather
complicated
however
barney
flats
is
a
good
solid
tasty
oatmeal
stout
smooth
with
ample
effervescence
this
is
quite
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
put
it
with
topshelf
offerings
such
as
samuel
smiths
outstanding
version
but
this
is
no
slouch
good
dtoo
expensive
for
what
ive
been
getting
so
far
its
ok
mouth
is
thick
but
not
very
rich
drinks
easy
but
im
not
really
sure
thats
a
good
thing
for
an
oatmeal
stout
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
come
to
expect
more
from
such
a
highly
rated
beer
drinkability
very
good
easy
to
drink
oatmeal
stout
overall
i
thought
it
could
have
been
a
bit
heaver
body
really
nice
beer
there
are
certainly
bigger
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
but
this
was
just
relaxing
and
really
nice
as
a
quick
aside
let
this
one
warm
up
a
little
bit
really
brings
out
the
flavors
as
the
bottle
suggests
serve
at
4045f
d
a
good
tasting
beer
being
lighter
than
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
this
beer
went
down
easy
i
heard
from
others
that
this
was
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
and
they
were
right
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
semisweet
chocolate
and
oatmeal
with
some
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
lots
of
caramel
some
chocolate
and
full
of
oats
and
malt
definitely
will
finds
its
way
into
my
fridge
again
d
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
imo
the
drinkability
is
much
higher
than
other
beers
from
this
style
great
brew
from
a
reputable
brewery
well
done
d
a
fair
slightly
above
average
oatmeal
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
pours
a
deep
brown
a
little
more
watery
looking
than
im
looking
for
in
a
stout
smell
is
sweet
sugar
chocolate
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
magnifies
the
sugar
and
chocolate
not
as
much
coffee
in
the
taste
slightly
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
the
silkysmooth
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
moderate
carbonation
and
good
drinkability
very
good
brew
d
nothing
remarkable
or
multidimensional
the
oatmeal
is
there
the
qualities
of
a
good
stout
are
there
well
done
and
thought
out
nice
to
see
one
that
plays
more
on
the
oatmeal
flavors
than
going
the
coffee
route
d
fairly
drinkable
pretty
solid
but
not
great
d
a
great
oatmeal
stout
very
easy
drinking
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
aroma
was
great
lots
of
chocolate
and
good
malty
smell
flavor
was
similar
to
the
smell
it
was
great
definitely
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
notes
from
111204
d
its
ok
i
havent
been
too
thrilled
on
the
taste
of
some
of
the
anderson
valley
beers
at
106pack
barney
flats
is
not
particularly
cheap
however
it
is
better
and
not
as
expensive
as
samuel
smiths
version
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
had
recently
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
12
oz
bottle
very
dark
black
with
a
brown
head
very
inviting
roasted
aroma
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
with
roasted
edges
slight
mineral
graininess
and
astringency
definately
some
cold
black
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
notes
very
well
rounded
and
tasty
more
integrity
than
many
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
decently
filling
which
affects
the
overall
drinkabilty
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
tasty
stout
that
i
will
be
having
again
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
decent
brew
da
decent
beer
but
as
an
oatmeal
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
the
thicker
mouthfeel
is
absent
and
the
overall
complexity
is
lacking
a
shame
as
i
have
enjoyed
other
beers
from
the
brewery
this
was
an
exceptionally
wellbalanced
stout
that
was
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
it
would
be
wellsuited
to
meals
as
well
as
cold
winter
months
definately
worth
a
try

also
a
well
balance
mix
between

really
enjoyable
with

very
well
done

well

while
still
being
easily
drinkable

tasty
and
complex

i

up
this

winnerya
digg
d
a
decent
oatmeal

but
my
bottle
wasnt
the
cream
of
the
crop
hopefully
mine
came
from
an
off
batch
that
didnt
get
caught
before
being
bottled

makes

a
nice
session

with

out
some
sweet
notes
and
a
great
black

bitterness
hitting
in
the
finish
combining
with
a
big
dense
feel
this
is
a
nice
one
to
sip
on
d
even
though
they
claim
its
not
just
for
breakfast
anymore
the
beer
would
be
good
at
any
time
of
the
day
perfect
for
casual
shindigs
or
just
relaxing
im
still
working
on
a
dish
it
would
pair
nice
with
i
made
a
beef
stew
with
it
as
the
base
and
it
turned
out
phenomenal
d
no
complaints
here
im
so
used
to
double
stouts
that
regular
stout
often
seem
weak
and
pathetic
but
this
one
is
quite
good
d
a
tad
heavy
on
the
stomach
but
not
hard
to
drink
find
it
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
other
more
hoppy
beers
drinkability
very
drinkable
though
the
chewiness
tricks
me
into
feeling
full
by
the
end
d
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
just
enough
bitterness
which
is
standard
for
a
stout
fairly
drinkable
none
of
the
beers
from
anderson
valley
knocked
my
socks
off
but
this
one
was
definitely
my
favorite
i
could
drink
em
all
night
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
it
is
very
dark
in
color
and
smells
chocolatey
and
rich
the
taste
wasnt
as
thick
and
creamy
as
i
would
have
liked
you
could
sense
the
oatmeal
but
it
didnt
leave
that
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
that
some
oatmeals
do
the
beer
has
a
little
bitterness
to
it
but
it
is
well
balanced
my
preference
for
an
oatmeal
stout
is
a
lower
ibu
bitterness
and
maybe
even
lower
abv
to
give
that
smooth
and
undescribable
taste
but
that
is
just
a
preference
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
drink
one
the
drink
settled
with
a
dark
black
chocolate
color
appearance
also
the
head
was
pretty
thin
but
included
some
patchy
lacing
aromas
had
a
mediumstrong
chocolate
flavor
wrapped
around
biscuit
flavors
taste
had
a
decently
mocha
flavoring
with
a
thick
breadyness
to
it
excellently
creamy
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
light
enough
to
enjoy
without
having
to
unbuckle
the
belt
overall
a
desertlike
treat
d
average
abv
good
taste
but
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
flavors
are
also
not
as
complex
and
engaging
as
compared
to
samuel
smiths
offering
would
drink
again
but
probably
bomber
in
a
sitting
will
do
me
fine
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
probably
my
favorite
anderson
valley
beer
so
far
this
is
some
good
beer
but
i
have
to
say
i
am
partial
to
oatmeal
stoutsi
e
goose
island
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
dark
beer
with
a
lacey
head
on
it
smells
good
and
tastes
even
better
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
this
brew
go
for
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
nice
burnt
coffee
taste
with
a
nice
kick
mouthfeel
is
great
plenty
of
body
but
not
too
much
a
nice
solidly
built
brew
i
could
certainly
have
another
or
two
of
these
black
as
night
with
a
quickly
disappearing
tan
head
nice
to
look
at
smell
is
also
very
nice
typically
roasted
smell
some
chocolate
some
hops
in
the
back
kinda
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
bells
beers
on
the
tongue
comes
across
as
slightly
overcarbonated
initial
pretty
sweet
with
an
almost
rootbeer
like
taste
though
not
that
sweet
some
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
finish
quite
a
nice
beer
you
could
finish
off
a
6
pack
easily
a
very
good
rendition
of
an
oatmeal
stout
bottle
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
great
initial
smell
with
roasted
malt
flavors
and
almost
a
slightly
bourbonoaked
aged
flavoring
bourbonoak
flavoring
vanishes
giving
way
to
roasted
chocolate
malt
aromas
flavor
is
well
balanced
between
roasted
chocolate
and
hop
flavors
and
slight
oatlike
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
lighter
than
i
prefer
for
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
good
so
is
drinkability
poured
into
a
glass
and
got
a
nice
looking
head
that
settled
into
a
thinner
lacing
the
color
was
a
dark
brownblack
that
looked
almost
like
coffee
at
times
the
smell
had
a
fruity
and
maple
scent
that
i
picked
up
the
taste
was
very
smooth
something
that
i
was
not
expecting
the
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
thick
after
a
couple
of
sips
this
is
s
stout
that
i
could
enjoy
for
an
hour
or
2
but
after
that
its
too
thick
on
the
palate
for
my
taste
overall
a
very
good
one
here
if
you
find
one
give
it
a
try
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
d
with
smooth
rich
flavors
and
velvety
finish
this
is
over
the
top
easy
to
drink
way
to
go
av
dark
brown
color
with
a
mocha
head
of
about
a
finger
leaves
some
solid
lacing
on
the
glass
chocolate
and
roasty
aromas
emanate
from
the
foam
flavor
is
hearty
chocolate
malt
with
a
little
fruity
hop
character
too
much
carbonation
hurts
the
mouthfeel
and
disrupts
the
richness
of
the
body
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
a
fantastic
tan
head
it
didnt
stick
around
too
long
but
nice
none
the
less
no
lacing
on
the
glass
had
a
dark
chocolate
malty
smell
a
bit
smoky
as
well
which
is
very
nice
almost
a
burnt
smell
i
let
it
warm
up
before
trying
this
is
one
fantastic
tasting
beer
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
the
mild
smoke
smell
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
well
balanced
drinkability
this
is
most
likely
very
drinkable
if
you
are
eating
but
as
a
stand
alone
i
would
only
do
a
few
because
the
sweet
maltiness
totally
dominated
my
mouth
12oz

in

more
chocolate
in

flavor
along
with
a
slight
tang
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
along
with
dry
chocolate
malt
very
smooth
and
drinkable
d
this
is
a
great
stout
it
has
enough
bitter
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
to
earn
the
stout
moniker
but
its
sweet
and
creamy
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
too
burnt
and
bitter
i
like
this
a
lot
pours
black
with
a
tall
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
candy
nougat
and
cocoa
smooth
milky
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
oats
and
espresso
theres
a
slight
sour
tang
from
the
oats
i
guess
but
its
nice
and
approprite
for
the
style
the
body
is
medium
weight
and
very
smooth
with
lowmedium
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
toasty
and
meaty
but
reminds
me
of
a
cookie
somehow
i
guess
im
not
quite
sure
whats
going
on
here
but
its
a
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
mix
of
flavors
a

up
and
tips
slightly
toward
the
sweet
end
of
the
scale
still
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinkin
oatmeal
stout
d
because
it
is
an
oatmeal
stout
that
is
mellow

to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
at
3

a
bomber
it
is
also
reasonably
priced
i
see
more
of
these
in
my
future
d
this
is
an
understated
mellow
stout
that
gets
you
with
its
dedication
to
strong

rational
hopping
combined
with
toasted

easy
to

one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
id
have
no
problem
drinking
a
couple
or
3
at
a
session
good
stuff
drinkability
very
high
drinkability
on
this
one
i
would
be
happy
to
have
one
or
five
and
due
to
the
5
7
abv
i
could
handle
either
or
excellent
with
hearty
dishes
such
as
chili
or
steak
poured
a
nice
opaque
color
with
good
if
a
bit
fizzy
head
and
decent
lacing
had
a
nice
coffeeoatmeal
scent
but
a
little
weak
what
was
there
was
nice
but
it
wasnt
as
full
as
it
could
be
good
taste
nothing
great
but
it
is
a
decent
stout
with
a
nice
oatmeal
taste
just
a
bit
timid
goes
down
fine
a
little
fizzy
but
nice
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
but
i
would
still
get
it
any
day
considering
their
green
methods
of
brewing
d
definitely
a
good
beer
but
less
dryness
would
be
lots
better
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
ever
had
smooth
complex
flavors
without
being
too
strong
im
a
big
fan
all
around
glad
i
have
five
more
bottles
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
black
in
the
glass
and
has
a
thick
tan
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
enjoyable
milk
chocolate
marshmallow
and
slight
coffee
are
present
perhaps
a
bit
of
butteryness
the
taste
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
had
expected
but
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
milk
stout
from
the
smell
not
a
typical
stout
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
bitterness
from
the
roasted
notes
and
slight
unidentifiable
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
from
the
oatmeal
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ever
but
a
very
solid
one
pours
basically
black
with
a
big
big
lasting
light
brown
head
roasty
bitter
smell
but
it
was
quite
light
for
a
stout
taste
is
rich
smooth
creamy
and
roasty
with
a
traditional
oatmeal
stout
like
flavor
very
indicitave
of
the
style
and
even
though
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
i
like
the
other
3
oatmeals
ive
had
a
bit
to
quite
a
bit
better
not
too
strongly
flavored
and
it
is
lacking
a
bit
of
needed
sweetness
i
think
a
decent
beer
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
this
is
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
that
ive
ever
had
great
flavors
and
not
one
aspect
is
too
over
powering
i
tip
my
hat
to
the
brewers
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
4sugars
coffee
sweet
but
balanced
nicely
by
a
light
hop
bitterness
theres
really
not
a
ton
going
on
here
but
there
doesnt
need
to
be
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
i
was
really
impressed
with
anderson
valleys
winter
ale
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
their
oatmeal
stout
which
i
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
one
didnt
disappoint
poured
a
beautiful
jetblack
ebony
hue
with
a
reddish
and
tan
frothy
head
that
exhibited
some
staying
power
smell
was
as
expected
of
the
style
with
dark
and
rich
cocoa
and
latte
notes
pouring
through
taste
was
absolutely
superb
for
the
style
very
different
distinct
and
unique
with
a
sweet
noncloying
caramel
and
dark
sugar
flavor
that
was
really
pleasing
and
satisfying
without
being
overwhelming
the
flavor
was
really
great
on
this
one
a
topnotch
brew
and
an
excellent
depicition
of
the
style
great
stuff
with
an
ultracreamy
and
superthick
mouthfeel
drinkability
was
equally
good
with
a
relatively
low
abv
that
surrounded
a
terffic
taste
definitely
recommended
d
a
nice
change
of
pace
not
too
heavy
but
not
too
light
one
or
two
would
be
pretty
good
but
after
that
got
this
one
on
tap
at
my
local
overpriced
beer
joint
for
swells
cant
say
too
much
about
the
appearance
do
to
the
dark
lighting
nice
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
with
a
bit
of
roasted
smokiness
but
none
of
that
ashtray
over
done
the
roasted
malt
problem
so
many
stouts
suffer
from
the
hops
hang
around
in
the
background
nicely
balancing
the
character
without
announcing
their
presence
unless
you
look
for
them
the
oatmeal
provides
a
nice
smoothness
that
doesnt
require
you
to
wait
between
sips
a
great
example
of
what
a
stout
should
be
another
of
a
dozen
brews
from
the
very
generous
tayner
thanks
d
while
in
terms
of
alcohol
its
kind
on
the
brain
its
pretty
big
however
i
do
find
myself
taking
it
back
pretty
quickly
if
only
for
that
rich
mouthful
sensation
an
excellent
stout
recommended
a
smooth
beer
that
goes
down
easy
worth
picking
up
very
tasty
and
a
spoton
body
what
i
want
in
an
american
oatmeal
stout
pretty
pricey
but
a
dime
a
bottle
this
brew
is
worth
every
sip

i
liked
this
brew
it
is
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
extremely
easy
to
consume
it
has
a
good
depth
to
the
flavor
and
is
appropriately
balanced
toward
the
malts
i
would
certainly
welcome
another

live
up
to
what
has
preceded
it
overall
quietly
sweet
feel
is
pretty
thick
as
youd
expect
from
the
style
very
drinkable
upon
my
first
sip
i
probably
downed
14
of
the
bottle
because
it
was
so
smooth
and
i
couldnt
help
myself
overall
a
pretty
darn
good
oatmeal
stout
this
is
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
ever
had
d
yes
may
i
please
have
another
as
this
was
a
wonderful
stout
the
strengths
of
this
beer
are
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
oatmeal
provides
an
incredible
richness
and
smoothness
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
a
great
session
beer
and
a
nice
easy
sipper
for
the
cold
weather
notes
a
great
session
stout
not
exceptionally
complex
but
nicely
balanced
and
very
flavorful
d
not
too
bad
served
better
chilled
than
room
temp
this
is
pretty
damn
dark
almost
as
dark
as
victorys
storm
king
i
delved
into
when
i
jumped
the
gun
30
or
so
days
ago
but
really
i
dont
recall
ever
seeing
something
as
dark
as
those
colorwise
its
right
on
hue
with
any
previous
oatmeal
stout
ive
tried
and
a
peanut
butter
colored
head
that
faded
fairly
fast
a
very
roasted
scent
reminding
me
of
an
ealy
winter
bonfire
warm
and
mellow
caramel
oats
and
coffee
flavor
on
the
front
end
like
breakfast
on
a
cold
morning
where
ya
need
something
to
warm
your
bones
before
you
go
outside
to
dig
the
car
out
of
8
inches
of
snow
because
even
though
the
kids
got
a

ya
have

go

has

to
the
workday
is
done
and
the
chillun
are
in
bed
before
relaxing
with
a
laid
back
yet
hearty
brew
but
this
one
is
a
great
reward
a
slight
bit
of
hops
shows
up
in
the
aftertaste
but
its
not
at
all
bitter
because
its
balanced
by
a
smokey

and
malt

out
the

that
can

be
found
in

beers
not

as

still
quite

who
needs
an
imperial
stout
when
you
have
this
one
of
the
first
oatmeal
stouts
i
had
nice
to
come
back
to
it
a
very
solid
stout
at
under
6
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
used
to
drink
before
i
knew
what

was

darker

with

tasting
nose
is
roasty
with
cocoa
notes
and
a

taste
consistent
with

but
a
little
ashy
and
theres
a
feint
metallic
quality
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
but
closer
to
light
with
a
prickly
slightly
gassy
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
but
a
little
thin
and
perhaps
a
bit
past
its
prime
pours
a
very
dark
colour
roughly
three
fingers
of

coloured

little

aroma
is
quite
nice
and
inviting
mostly
mocha
and
coffee
nice
mouthfeel
not
overly
heavy
or
overwhelming
the
aftertaste
is
inoffensive
probably
not
as
heavy
as
you
would
expect
for
an
oatmeal
stout
not
overly
bitter
on
the
tongue
something
you
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
especially
at
a
reasonable
5
abv
something
i
would
recommend
to
pretty
much
anyone
in
the
depths
of
a
long
winter
intriguing
nose
but
not
as
full
and
smooth
as
id
expect
for
an
oatmeal
stout
for
that
though
theres
piles
of
nuance
a
bit
of
smoke
black
fruit
cola
almost
like
its
halfway
between
an
english
stout
and
an
ris

possibly
the

interesting

ive
had

abv
tasty
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
is
a
good
dark
beer
and
i
would
definitley
recommend
it
to
any
of
my
friends
it
is
smooth
going
down
and
there
is
a
nice
taste
and
aftertaste
this
beer
lasts
and
thats
the
key
to
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
beer
but
it
does
the
job
and
does
it
well
even
from
the
can
it
tastes
good
so
you
wont
here
me
complaining
any
time
soon
its
got
a
nice
alcohol
percentage
so
your
not
choking
on
the
liquor
and
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
flavor
this
has
been
my
first
encounter
sith
st
ambroise
and
it
it
wont
be
my
last
i
find
the
bros
score
a
little
high
but
i
would
have
to
definitly
say
this
beer
is
in
the
high
80s
good
job
you
french
bastards
its
pretty
great
living
in
canada
i
can
always
find
this
beer
and
i
keep
a
stock
of
it
in
my
fridge
one
of
the
best
darker
beers
you
can
find
great
richness
and
depth
a
deep
brown
verging
on
black
pour
the
head
was
short
lived
with
very
little
lacing
as
the
level
decreased
no
strong
scent
outside
of
a
mild
roast
malt
and
caramel
very
smooth
especailly
after
enjoys
some
strong
rips
during
he
week
well
rounded
with
not
much
bitterness
except
at
the
finish
some
dark
chocolate
undertones
but
mostly
a
lightly
roasted
malt
not
as
chewy
as
i
had
anticipated
but
still
quite
enjoyable
a
good
midweek
stout
very
tasty
but
not
too
strong
d
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
had
recently
crisp
and
refreshing
and
a
nice
finish
to
go
along
with
all
that
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
think
having
it
in
epcotdisney
made
it
tens
times
better
i
used
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
this
latest
sixpack
was
very
soy
saucey
the
date
indicates
it
is
fresh
as
well
enjoy
o
this
stout
is
more
roastforward
with
the
chocolaty
sweetness
being
an
afterthought
nothing
incredible
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
one
again
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
what
you
expect
absolutely
yes
go
for
it
and
crab
a
pack
of
6
or
12
if
you
find
it
its
an
amazing
beer
much
better
than
a
rickards
dark
or
even
a
guinness
original
if
you
hate
the
taste
of
coffee
dont
take
this
beer
but
overall
damn
what

beer

overall
an

beer
o
so
so
good
this
beer
always
amazes
me
with
how
flavourful
it
is
at
such
a
low
abv
one
of
my
alltime
favourites
its
shocking
how
the
roast
character
in
this
beer
is
deeper
than
a
lot
of
highabv
stouts
a
bit
better
from
the
bottle
please
try
this
beer
o
head
wasnt
as
rich
and
full
as
i
usually
like
in
a
stout
the
flavor
was
simple
but
tasty
mouthfeel
of
the
body
was
very
nice
and
the
best
part
of
this
beer
overall
this
really
is
a
great
beer
exceptional
mouthfeel
and
lots
of
warm
comforting
flavours
very
highly
recommended
food
match
immediately
pastries
such
as
croissants
chocolatine
and
brioche
springs
to
mind
this
is
after
all
like
drinking
a
thick
rich
cup
of
coffee
i
wonder
if
i
can
get
away
with
drinking
this
beer
for
breakfast
aside
from
this
it
would
pair
with
æbleflæsk
or
any
pumpernickel
rugbrød
based
dish
if
you
hate
pumpernickel
too
bad
a
slight
miss
here
still
quite
tasty
but
expected
a
bit
more
awesome
pitch
black
color
with
a
creamy
head
i
picked
up
on
a
sour
burnt
aroma
almost
like
charcoal

scent
the
more
i
sipped
the
more
the
smoke
flavor
came
through
low
ibu
it
was
fairly
thin
viscosity
very
low
carbonation
almost
flat
i
see
the
92
rating
but
im
just
not
feeling
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
that
im
not
a
fan
of
any
of
the
smokestyle
beers
and
wasnt
expecting
this
oatmeal
stout
to
be
so
smoke
forward
drinkability
recommended
let
it
warm
maybe
pour
it
a
few
more
times
from
glass
to
glass
and
it
gets
more
interesting
bold
must
try
o
looking
at
the
bottle
i
didnt
expect
such
a
great
beer
but
this
is
probably
my
favorite
canadian
beer
overall
an
oatmeal
stout
that
showcases
all
the
elements
relevant
to
the
style
the
woody
characteristic
was
a
unique
element
to
this
brew
another
winner
from
a
stellar
brewery
o
fairly
straightforward
bold
roastyass
stout
i
like
it
its
not
playing
around
not
desserty
or
rich
probably
a
fine
choice
to
accompany
slightly
rich
or
oily
foods
itll
cut

enjoyed
this
casually
a
few
times
before
and
i
admire
it
more
now
even
though
while
sick
there
really
aint
a
lot
to
complain
about
considering
its
under
15
in
my
area
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
sip
just
one
and
appreciate
its
qualities
as
fine
and
unique
or
enjoy
a
few
and
not
shortcircuit
my
tastebuds
completely
overall
a
delicious
oatmeal
stout
that
strikes
all
the
right
balances
in
terms
of
flavor
profiles
mouthfeel

drinkability

recommended

in

is
hearty
grainy
and
deeply
satisfying
coffee
and
chocolate
provide
the
lynchpins
but
there
are
some
really
nice
mellow
fruity
notes
raisins
and
delicate
herbal
flavors
to
provide
complexity
syrupy
molasses
and
some
dry
nuts
nothing
clashes
or
makes
itself
known
in
an
unpleasant
way
palate
is
silky
smooth
and
body
is
heavy
and
thick
oats
add
some
astringency
and
although
i
am
not
wild
about
oats
in
brewing
here
the
bitterness
rounds
out
the
heavy
dark
flavors
and
sweetness
nicely
finish
dry
and
chalky
fanastic
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
that
hits
the
deep
dark
complexity
mark
without
being
unbalanced
atmosphere
is
really
good
decent
head
and
some
fair

nose
is
an
excellent
combination
of
coffee

and

very
roasty
with
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
pungent

and
even
a

on

with

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of

with
a
slightly

medium

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
great
set
of
aromas
but
the
flavors
dont
match
up
so
well
in
my
opinion
wow
i
cant
say
i
was
expecting
much
from
this
random
pickup
but
this
is
honestly
a
superlative
oatmeal
stout
its
got
the
trademark
oatmeal
smoothness
but
hints
of
smoke
bitter
coffee
and
leafy
hops
keep
things
very
interesting
its
got
more
flavor
than
some
imperial
stouts
ive
had
yet
clocks
in
at
a
modest
5
abv
if
you
see
this
buy
it
and
buy
more
than
the
single
i
bought
i
wish
i
had
more
pours
deep
black
with
cocoa
edges
that
appear
against
the
light
the
head
is
gone
but
the
lacing
continues
the
roasted
malt
echoes
across
the
nose
reminding
me
of
sunrise
in
peru
the
sour
coffee
bitterness
holds
back
the
flavor
for
me
although
the
beautiful
buttery
tannins
of
a
good
merlot
make
this
a
very
interesting
beer
probably
a
good
gateway
for
your
wine
snob
friends
silky
smooth
malt
rolls
into
coffee
bitterness
in
a
jarring
contrast
but
i
could
have
another
reviewed
71708
o
i
did
not
get
the
oatmeal
flavor
at
all
tasted
more
chocolaty
and
like
coffee
than
it
did
oatmeal
nevertheless
its
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
canadian
classic
very
nice
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
browntoblack
coloring
with
hazelnut
highlights
and
a
light
tan
frothy
clingy
head
that
starts
a
solid
inch
and
quickly
settles
into
a
coating
along
the
glass
and
surface
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
caramel
a
touch
of
molasses
and
cream
very
well
balanced
and
very
rich
flavors
are
roasted
initially
with
a
coffee
backbone
and
hints
of
smoke
highlighting
very
bitter
and
dry
but
balanced
very
well
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
coffee
with
hints
of
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
the
grain
bill
helps
keep
things
smooth
and
balanced
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
slightly
bitter
linger
very
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
toasty
warm
liquid
cigar
in
a
glass
an
absolutely
exceptional
brew
o
very
good
oatmeal
stout
very
easy
drinking
dry
finish
little
hops
very
nicely
balanced
with
the
espresso
chocolate
and
malts
o
an
excellent
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
thats
versatile
terrific
for
drinking
and
cooking
in
stews
breads
big
flavour
that
offers
plenty
to
enjoy
rjt
final
thoughts
an
excellent
stout
and
is
a
very
worthy
flagship
brew
for
mcauslan
like
most
stouts
i
dont
know
if
id
want
to
drink
this
all
night
but
4
or
5
would
certainly
make
me
a
happy
camper
highly
recommend
overall
i
liked
it
but
wasnt
worth
the
price
tag
overall
this
is
a
good
brewit
comes
from
canada
so
i
suspect
this
is
a
more
european
style
stout
with
its
bittertoalmostsour
flavorits
malty
beginning
is
rich
and
flavorful
the
bitter
finish
is
watery
and
souris
it
good
yeah
but
i
dont
think
id
see
this
out
againi
would
try
it
on
tap
if
i
ever
saw
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
scoop
up
another
bottleits
worth
trying
but
not
the
stout
flavor
im
accustomed
to
or
one
that
im
gonna
add
to
my
lexicon3
55
overall
very
good
beer
first
time
i
tried
it
was
with
oysters
and
it
paired
very
well
i
have
bought
this
beer
since
and
it
will
probably
hold
a
space
in
my
fridge
from
now
on
pretty
cheap
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
live
close
to
montreal
in
fact
cheaper
than
some
hyped
up
macros
like
stella
and
newcastle
this
beer
helped
me
get
into
stout
and
it
made
me
stay
highly
recommend
it
awesome
mouthfeel
very
smooth
robust
a
great
oatmeal
stout
from
mcauslan
d
i
remember
liking
this
a
lot
more
about
five
years
ago
and
im
wondering
if
the
recipe
has
been
watered
down
or
if
exposure
to
the
worlds
best
beers
has
recalibrated
my
palate
its
not
bad
and
will
do
in
a
pinch
if
you
have
to
go
to
the
beer
store
but
its
merely
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
better
on
nitro
if
you
can
find
it
i
easily
put
down
the
355ml
bottle
but
i
probably
wont
a
sixer
with
so
many
better
options
available
locally
appearance
is
pitch
black
with
a
large
light
brown
head
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
coffee
and
oatmeal
with
a
slight
burnt
scent
it
seemed
a
bit
weak
though
the
taste
reminded
me
of
oatmeal
sweetened
with
maple
syrup
it
had
a
sweetness
to
it
but
it
wasnt
overpowering
at
all
the
sweetness
was
nicely
balanced
with
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
thicker
mouthfeel
while
oatmeal
stouts
are
not
a
style
i
prefer
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
it
would
pair
really
well
with
a
dessert
d
pretty
tasty
dry
stouty
drinkable
not
too
shabby
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
encountered
it
does
a
particularly
great
job
of
balancing
the
bitterness
and
intensity
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
sweeter
malts
and
an
ideal
addition
of
oats
that
plays
well
on
the
nutty
grainy
character
without
overwhelming
the
other
malts
or
making
an
oily
moutfeel
this
oatmeal
stout
has
lots
off
good
things
going
for
it
found
it
a
great
way
to
end
my
session
at
the
pub
and
overwhelmed
by
its
flavor
pours
really
dark
the
roasted
flavor
of
the
malt
overtakes
a
lot
of
sweetness
hiding
in
this
gem
halfway
thru
i
wanted
another
it
goes
down
like
a
light
beer
but
gives
that
kick
in
taste
buds
ideally
found
in
ipas
it
has
a
slight
but
not
overwhelming
taste
that
is
need
in
a
stout
to
make
it
stand
out
im
not
great
at
reviewing
beers
but
will
def
seek
this
out
and
have
it
again
at
the
pub
or
bottled
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
the
well
balanced
flavors
and
the
lighter
body
for
a
stout
very
enjoyable
and
pretty
close
to
sessionable
just
a
little
bigger
tasting
than
i
normally
have
for
a
session
beer
pours
dark
blackbrown
with
light
brown
head
aroma
of
roastiness
and
wet
dog
a
dryer
taste
than
i
like
with
only
light
hints
of
coffee
or
chocolate
also
some
fruity
flavor
which
is
a
little
weird
highly
carbonated
for
a
stout
and
seems
to
be
closer
to
a
porter
on
the
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
nowhere
near
my
favorite
for
this
style
a
bit
disappointed
like
i
said
i
explain
the
complexity
of
this
stout
you
have
to
drink
to
understand
a
great
great
oatmeal
stout
fairly
decent
though
ive
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
if
theres
a
problem
its
that
everything
is
put
together
fairly
well
except
the
flavors
themselves
which
could
stand
to
be
richer
in
comparison
to
the
appearance
the
nose
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
no
slouch
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
goes
a
bit
over
the
top
in
the
darker
bitter
smokier
graininess
more
oats
less
roast
drinks
like
an
oatmeal
porter
if
that
makes
sense
this
is
interesting
like
an
earlier
poster
tried
this
because
of
the
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
was
kinda
dissapointed
intitially
but
as
it
warmed
it
got
better
but
still
not
as
good
as
the
samuel
smith
the
appearance
is
very
dark
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
as
it
warms
a
dark
fruit
with
prunes
arises
the
taste
is
a
creamy
expresso
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
kinda
mild
overall
this
is
decent
but
there
are
other
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
would
choose
first
overall
i
have
had
this
years
ago
in
my
travels
to
quebec
and
good
to
see
that
it
has
made
distribution
down
here
to
the
states
will
be
looking
forward
to
more
of
these
in
the
future
i
ordered
this
because
i
love
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
but
i
had
no
particular
expectations
the
first
sip
was
shockingly
excellent
particularly
in
terms
of
mouth
feel
this
is
possibly
the
smoothest
creamiest
beer
ive
ever
had
in
addition
it
has
a
rich
deep
dark
flavor
with
very
little
bitterness
this
beer
is
what
other
stouts
dream
of
being
i
just
hope
its
as
good
out
of
a
bottle
o
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
overall
nice
flavorful
and
not
too
watery
like
many
low
abv
stouts
the
diacetyl
flavor
is
a
bit
offputting
though
final
grade
4
25
on
the
high
side
of
an
a
ive
put
off
trying
this
stuff
for
a
long
time
but
having
finally
sampled
it
its
pretty
easy
to
see
how
it
embedded
itself
into
canadas
top
100
list
stambroise
oatmeal
stout
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
wellcrafted
canadian
stouts
i
have
ever
had
and
any
fan
of
sessionable
dark
beers
would
be
doing
themselves
a
disservice
by
avoiding
this
not
sure
if
its
worth
seeking
out
but
its
certainly
worth
a
try
and
something
i
will
undoubtedly
get
again
overall
packs
the
flavor
5
and
while
less
intense
than
i
remember
still
a
great
quality
stout
at
an
affordable
price
and
that
is
widely
available
taste
is
bland
and
unoffensive
nothing
special
here
and
the
roasted
malt
isnt
particularly
great
either
ive
had
many
better
straightup
oatmeal
stouts
my
pour
produced
a
finger
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
that
allowed
zero
light
penetration
nose
was
fairly
sweet
perhaps
milk
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
the
taste
was
like
coffee
with
cream
this
was
more
like
a
scoop
of
coffee
ice
cream
or
a
mocha
shake
than
a
beer
finish
was
smooth
and
sweet
a
very
nice
beer
and
thanks
again
for
the
hookup
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
best
ive
had
pours
dark
brown
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
and
some
coffee
maybe
a
little
bit
of
smoke
too
the
flavor
is
somewhat
smokey
as
well
with
quite
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
just
a
little
bit
of
cocoachocolate
sweetness
cant
believe
ive
never
had
this
before
this
is
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
and
at
5
it
is
sessionable
jet
black
in
colour
nearly
two
fingers
of
tan
head
nice
retention
with
lots
of
thick
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
roasted
and
chocolatey
a
bit
of
coffee
lots
of
mil
chocolate
here
and
a
bit
of
smoke
as
well
taste
follows
the
nose
and
is
nice
and
roasty
with
milk
chocolate
light
sweetness
good
bitterness
and
coffee
flavours
roast
and
smoke
in
finish
and
aftertaste
smooth
feel
lightmed
carbonation
creamy
and
medium
bodied
this
was
finished
quite
quickly
and
something
i
have
enjoyed
every
time
i
have
had
solid
consistent
and
delicious
cheers
lampertland
o
the
charred
bitterness
hurts
drinkability
somewhat
but
its
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
quite
the
quaffable
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
with
an
extra
hoppiness
this
is
a
hop
heads
stout
so
enjoy
it
i
am
a
pretty
good
otmeal
stout
and
definitely
up
with
the
best
of
them
i
found
it
enjoyable
during
the
winter
months
o
if
it
werent
so
burnt
tasting
it
would
be
soo
much
better
will
try
another
bottle
in
the
future
to
see
if
my
opinion
changes
not
as
creamy
as
you
would
think
for
an
oatmeal
stout
an
ok
offering
but
not
a
stand
out
bottom
line
not
my
cup
of
tea
a
total
sensory
delight
i
must
admit
i
was
surprised
and
tried
it
on
a
lark
but
i
am
a
convert
overall
a
fairly
solid
effort
it
was
good
but
it
needed
perhaps
a
bit
more
balance
maybe
some
sweetness
to
really
wow
me
i
will
commend
them
for
packing
in
a
lot
of
flavor
in
to
a
5
stout
overall
some
things
are
nice
and
somethings
are
not
that
great
with
this
oatmeal
stout
the
body
falls
flat
for
the
aroma
and
taste
its
nice
bottle
courtesy
of
coldbrewky
pours
a
jet
black
hue
with
tan
on
the
edges
capped
by
a
tan
head
with
great
retention
hint
of
roast
in
the
nose
roast
light
bittering
chocolate
toffee
all
add
to
a
complex
taste
mouth
is
light
and
super
creamy
amazing
o
i
probably
couldve
given
more
credit
to
the
taste
but
i
feel
i
do
beers
and
fellow
beer
advocates
a
service
when
i
am
picky
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
and
a
nice
change
up
from
both
guinness
draughtextra
stout
and
a
lot
of
the
micro
brew
stouts
which
have
restrained
the
roast
profile
far
too
much
o
sessionable
stout
wonderful
amount
of
hops
for
a
black
beer
without
sacrificing
the
roastiness
not
too
sweet
at
all
poured
from
a
brown
11
5
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
oats
and
malts
taste
is
malts
smoke
chocolate
a
touch
of
oats
and
coffee
lots
of
complexity
yet
somehow
feels
off
just
a
bit
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
half
finger
light
brown
medium
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
thin
film
and
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
molasses
flavor
is
toasted
and
pleasant
almost
burnt
malts
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
light
presence
of
dark
fruits
somewhat
dry
finish
with
toasted
malt
and
a
light
bitterness
body
is
light
to
medium
a
pleasant
stout
that
tastes
more
like
a
export
than
a
oatmeal
stout
o
not
bad
just
meh
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
might
have
to
give
this
one
more
chance
before
signing
off
completely
will
update
if
anything
changes
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
about
as
drinkable
as
an
oatmeal
stout
can
get
the
body
is
quite
full
for
a
5
abv
beer
coats
your
mouth
well
but
never
becomes
sticky
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
fizzy
in
the
background
but
does
not
interfere
at
all
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
really
adds
to
the
experience
notes
such
a
dam
hearty
beer
very
drinkable
and
great
for
a
winter
night
cheers
cost
unknown
d
great
stout
but
not
exactly
as
advertised
the
oatmeal
flavors
i
had
anticipated
never
really
came
to
fruition
but
the
addition
of
the
oats
certainly
adds
some
smoothness
overall
the
flavor
profile
here
is
crafted
beautifully
very
well
balanced
but
still
packs
a
big
bold
flavor
all
around
great
stout
mcauslan
plays
this
one
straight
down
the
middle
appropriate
deep
brownblack
with
a
nominal
mocha
head
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
and
roasted
malt
up
front
moderate
roasted
malt
with
a
faint
charcoal
hint
some
oatmeal
sweetness
creeps
in
toward
the
middle
and
the
beer
goes
slightly
dry
toward
the
finish
super
black
and
super
thick
with
a
stiff
head
the
color
of
cardboard
youll
find
that
it
nearly
gloops
from
the
bottle
into
your
glass
do
not
be
afraid
however
as
its
tamer
than
it
looks
still
this
is
a
superb
oatmeal
stout
in
the
sam
smith
league
the
roasty
aroma
has
a
nice
peachy
edge
to
it
and
the
roasty
taste
maintains
the
fruitiness
without
being
overly
sweet
except
at
the
finish
where
theres
an
odd
sugary
sensation
no
matter
it
doesnt
subtract
from
the
overall
greatness
of
this
beer
o
caaanada
etc
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
all
levels
this
one
i
would
say
is
a
bit
of
a
diamond
in
the
rough
pretty
good
not
your
standard
style
oatmeal
stout
i
was
a
little
off
put
by
the
sourness
of
it
at
first
but
upon
further
sips
i
believe
that
they
didnt
overdo
it
with
that
flavor
and
it
actually
makes
this
beer
all
the
more
interesting
hopefully
it
isnt
a
bad
batch
or
maybe
thankfully
either
way
i
will
drink
all
of
the
4
pack
i
bought
for
sure
this
beer
is
getting
better
as
it
warms
up
received
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
nitro
tap
nice
creamy
head
with
cascade
as
expected
dark
brown
almost
black
once
settled
not
much
aroma
through
the
foam
the
tase
is
mostly
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
little
smokiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
not
as
exciting
as
i
expected
a
good
oatmeal
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lacing
its
aroma
is
of
dark
toast
coffee
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
flavor
has
notes
of
dark
chocolate
oatmeal
milk
and
mild
coffee
at
the
end
there
is
a
welcome
warmth
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
mcauslan
stambroise
oatmeal
stout
is
a
good
beer
smooth
and
perfect
during
an
early
october
snowstorm
highly
recommended
starting
things
off
right
today
with
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
it
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
chocolate
powder
toasted
oats
very
light
charcoal
and
a
nice
vein
of
vanilla
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
oats
are
more
toasted
the
malts
more
roasted
and
the
vanilla
seems
to
have
dropped
out
completely
some
lightly
bitter
coffee
is
tossed
in
there
for
good
measure
as
well
unfortunately
the
bitter
and
charred
end
of
the
flavor
spectrum
is
spotlighted
here
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
dry
finish
overall
what
starts
out
as
a
damn
fine
oatmeal
stout
takes
a
turn
for
the
worse
with
diminished
flavors
a
slightly
thin
feel
and
a
bad
case
of
overcarbonation
still
not
truly
bad
but
this
is
quite
the
disappointment
o
this
is
a
very
good
brew
the
tastes
and
smells
alone
arent
very
unique
but
i
really
liked
how
the
beer
bounces
back
and
forth
between
sweet
and
bitter
o
very
good
oatmeal
stout
but
not
as
slick
as
i
like
it
o
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
drank
in
awhile
quite
complex
for
a
stout
and
one
i
will
be
definitely
drinking
again
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
style
oatmeal
stout
o
outstanding
stout
spoton
perfect
was
to
end
the
day
o
bought
as
a
single
bottle
on
a
whim
with
no
particular
expectations
i
lucked
out
and
stumbled
upon
one
of
the
very
best
if
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
encountered
almost
beyond
criticism
this
stout
lacks
only
a
bit
of
depth
and
complexity
although
it
certainly
has
a
good
bit
of
both
highly
recommended
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
i
didnt
even
think
of
it
as
an
alcoholic
beverage
at
first
since
it
isnt
in
any
way
boozy
it
tastes
the
same
as
it
smells
and
after
tastes
the
same
just
a
nice
stout
one
could
drink
several
many
of
these
overall
a
pretty
impressive
oatmeal
stout
especially
considering
this
is
always
readily
available
at
my
local
beer
store
which
offers
only
largely
macro
cases
a
nice
abv
weigh
in
and
certainly
one
of
the
only
credible
stouts
in
the
barren
beer
wasteland
that
is
ont
o
solid
stout
perhaps
just
a
touch
too
much
expresso
for
me
but
ticks
all
the
boxes
this
is
a
nicely
dark
bodied
beer
with
a
coffee
dark
chocolate
taste
the
only
problem
with
it
is
an
odd
aftertaste
when
finished
drinking
oatmeal
stout
is
a
relatively
new
taste
for
me
so
im
not
sure
if
it
is
supposed
to
be
sweeter
or
not
this
was
not
sweet
but
also
not
hoppybitter
another
beer
i
will
try
again
overall
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
and
has
obviously
been
made
lovingly
and
lavishly
one
note
while
excellent
in
a
bottle
this
is
even
better
on
tap
especially
when
purchased
in
quebec
where
its
pretty
much
guaranteed
to
be
fresh
from
the
brewer
if
not
for
the
strange
aftertaste
effects
this
would
be
a
solid
beer
but
this
bottle
at
least
is
nothing
particularly
special
overall
a
dependable
stout
that
is
pleasant
but
not
stellar
try
it
if
its
there
dont
seek
it
out
not
quite
as
full
flavored
as
one
might
hope
but
its
still
quite
tasty
right
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorite
canadian
beers
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
definitely
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
buy
again
o
its
a
bit
bitter
for
the
style
but
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
nonetheless
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
size
creamy
tan
head
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sweet
roasted
oat
aroma
the
taste
was
creamy
and
had
an
all
around
nice
complextion
was
nicely
carbonation
and
maybe
a
bit
much
so
overall
i
found
this
an
excelent
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
in
montreal
enjoyable
as
a
single
bottle
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
this
was
a
pretty
average
stout
for
me
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
have
had
alot
better
i
couldnt
drink
more
then
2
of
these
beers
on
tap
at
the
golden
kiwi
in
cambridge
have
enjoyed
from
a
bottle
in
the
past
and
this
is
even
better
could
be
the
silky
smoothness
of
the
nitro
tap
served
in
a
st
ambroise
pint
glass
jet
black
with
a
one
finger
head
the
color
of
a
rootbeer
float
beautiful
sweet
malt
smell
taste
is
slightly
bitter
chocolate
lots
of
malty
goodness
nicely
balanced
malthops
profile
mouthfeel
is
what
made
this
an
experience
to
remember
medium
bodied
but
almost
chewy
extremely
smooth
i
swooshed
it
in
my
mouth
on
each
gulp
i
could
not
get
enough
of
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
tremendous
stout
and
very
sessionable
at
5
sweet
but
not
so
sweet
that
you
only
want
one
although
i
can
grab
6
bottles
for
12
i
think
the
experience
from
having
it
on
tap
will
make
it
difficult
to
drink
from
a
bottle
pours
jet
black
with
a
persistent
light
tan
head
surprisingly
neutral
aroma
much
more
robust
with
more
assertive
flavors
than
i
recall
strong
cocoa
flavors
combined
with
espresso
and
burnt
grains
coffee
with
cream
flavors
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
up
even
a
bit
of
toasted
marshmallow
very
smooth
and
fullbodied
but
with
a
dry
finish
hops
are
kept
in
the
background
but
plenty
of
complexity
among
the
malts
to
keep
it
more
than
interesting
very
smooth
and
definitely
enjoyable
good
desert
beer
overall
great
full
bodied
stout
one
of
my
new
favorites
the
smell
and
taste
compliment
each
other
beautifully
i
may
have
a
new
standard
in
my
lineup
od
a
well
crafted
stout
overall
a
very
delicious
beer
would
definitely
buy
again
wow
this
is
impressive
maintains
the
perfect
balance
between
sweetness
and
roasty
char
oats
really
just
smooth
everything
out
here
without
contributing
much
flavor
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
bread
from
the
yeast
adds
to
the
depth
earthy
hop
flavor
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
not
as
velvety
and
viscous
as
the
best
of
the
style
exhibit
this
one
probably
cracks
my
top
five
oatmeal
stouts
very
well
done
taste
burn
grain
chocolate
coffee
the
cpj
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
is
smooth
and
flavorful
with
a
pleasant
hop
kick
overall
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
better
mfo
super
viscous
super
smooth
creamy
and
velvety
the
best
feel
to
a
beer
that
ive
ever
experienced
by
far
overall
this
is
a
very
satisfying
beer
and
one
of
my
personal
alltime
favorites
poured
dark
as
night
from
a
bottle
had
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
soon
dissipated
to
a
thin
line
the
smell
is
dark
malt
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
there
is
something
in
the
taste
that
does
not
sit
well
with
me
i
really
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
i
even
went
to
the
breweries
site
to
see
if
there
was
some
strange
intention
of
the
brewer
it
has
a
dry
finish
to
it
with
light
carbonation
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
but
did
not
do
much
for
me
roasty
chewy
and
draws
you
in
for
more
and
more
drinkability
for
the
style
its
a
really
good
drinker
sessioned
this
one
a
few
times
before
and
will
do
again
going
back
for
more
holy
crap
this
beer
is
dark
it
looks
like
molasses
the
head
is
a
nice
one
and
a
half
finger
in
width
and
it
is
probably
the
darkest
head
i
have
ever
seen
it
looks
like
super
dark
chocolate
milk
body
is
pitch
black
on
the
nose
you
get
all
the
characteristics
of
a
regular
stout
chocolate
heavy
malt
notes
and
not
much
hop
but
you
also
get
a
sweet
maybe
even
piny
smell
its
a
very
weird
smell
im
going
to
be
honest
the
sweet
piny
smell
doesnt
smell
too
appetizing
but
it
also
doesnt
smell
too
dominant
man
that
is
a
smooth
stout
it
flows
perfectly
from
front
to
middle
to
end
it
isnt
as
thick
as
i
like
my
stouts
but
im
coming
to
realize
thats
normal
for
eastern
beers
i
mean
on
one
hand
its
just
so
smooth
but
on
the
other
hand
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
going
on
yeah
you
get
the
malt
and
the
chocolate
but
it
is
very
small
overall
in
the
end
you
get
that
sweet
sour
taste
i
was
picking
up
on
in
the
smell
but
it
is
very
very
small
and
not
unpleasant
or
anything
the
taste
is
ok
overall
as
for
drinkability
that
is
very
very
high
because
it
is
so
smooth
mouthfeel
i
have
to
downgrade
because
like
i
said
i
like
my
stouts
thicker
than
this
overall
a
good
beer
overall
this
a
very
solid
beer
its
up
there
with
samuel
smith
as
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
rich
flavor
but
not
too
rich
full
body
and
just
a
really
good
beer
d
pretty
high
i
liked
this
one
on
the
brand
new
nitro
faucet
as
it
poured
much
better
than
the
old
one
pretty
good
balance
but
the
watery
feel
toward
the
end
brought
this
one
down
a
notch
or
two
good
stuff
none
the
less
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
definitive
versions
of
oatmeal
stout
it
is
a
little
on
the
roasted
side
but
it
is
one
damn
good
brew
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
offering
silky
smooth
in
the
feel
care
of
the
nitro
delivery
quite
easy
drinking
with
little
to
no
outstading
alcohol
character
the
ratio
of
sour
character
to
roasted
bitterness
is
a
bit
uneven
for
an
oatmeal
stout
d
great
mouthfeel
and
very
solid
beer
very
easy
to
drink
especially
only
being
5
i
find
that
this
one
may
be
a
bit
thin
but
its
creamy
properties
help
make
up
for
it
i
find
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
just
might
become
a
fast
favourite
d
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
come
from
a
nitrogen
faucet
the
pour
was
beautiful
and
left
a
nice
feel
the
nose
wasnt
big
but
the
flavors
did
come
together
nicely
id
have
two
before
needing
to
switch
to
something
else
the
flavor
is
pretty
smooth
with
slight
roasted
flavor
and
mild
spice
with
subtle
smoke
and
sweet
grainy
flavor
w
gentle
pepper
from
the
hops
and
light
fruit
from
the
yeast
adding
contrast
to
some
mild
acidity
and
tinges
of
woody
flavor
w
plummy
quality
as
it
finishes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
nitro
is
detracting
from
some
of
the
fullness
of
the
malt
for
me
it
seems
slightly
stripped
but
it
is
pretty
good
fro
the
style
i
wood
probably
prefer
a
bottle
i
think
it
is
a
quality
brew
overall
d
easy
sipping
drink
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
nothing
extraordinary
but
well
done
and
well
balanced
drinkability
is
good
with
the
low
abv
this
one
can
be
sessioned
all
night
long
d
the
astringency
kills
drinkability
as
does
the
buttery
flavor
at
5
this
is
a
real
easy
sipper
and
a
great
breakfast
beer
worth
picking
up
this
beer
pours
out
a
dark
velvety
brown
with
several
fingers
of
brown
white
head
with
lacing
that
lingers
all
down
the
length
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
slight
breadgrain
notes
the
taste
is
cocoa
roast
barley
and
a
silky
smooth
finish
from
the
oats
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
with
a
slight
coffeechocolate
bitter
taste
on
the
front
and
a
ridiculously
smooth
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
can
only
imagine
its
smoother
on
tap
than
it
is
out
of
the
bottle
wow
the
nose
is
awesome
for
an
oat
stout
the
taste
doesnt
quite
deliver
like
the
aroma
something
seemed
to
be
off
in
the
flavor
which
brings
down
drinkability
drink
an
excellent
tasting
beer
that
has
an
amazing
appearance
as
well
it
might
be
the
heavy
roasted
flavor
at
the
finish
or
the
less
that
creamy
body
that
make
this
one
fall
flat
for
me
im
not
sure
it
just
doesnt
hit
the
right
notes
with
me
this
is
a
very
easy
going
yet
to
me
complex
stout
that
anyone
could
pick
up
and
enjoy
at
5
you
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
be
just
right
d
over
twothirds
of
the
way
through
this
bottle
and
im
not
tired
of
it
not
in
the
least
i
try
not
to
rate
drinkability
until
i
finish
the
bottle
but
i
think
its
safe
to
call
this
one
a
little
early
this
is
very
drinkable
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
at
5
abv
this
would
be
sessionable
m
medium
body
slight
chew
moderate
carbonation
up
there
with
ipswitch
as
one
of
my
top
oatmeal
stouts
i
want
more
on
a
whim
i
grabbed
a
6pack
today
so
this
is
a
bit
of
a
homecoming
of
sorts
boy
oh
boy
it
is
even
better
than
i
remembered
just
an
excellent
stout
no
screwing
around
no
gimmicks
no
coffee
no
chocolate
no
fruit
just
a
friggin
excellent
stout
nothing
more
to
say
other
than
i
am
somewhat
upset
with
myself
for
neglecting
this
fine
beer
for
so
many
years
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
especially
since
it
isnt
fullbodied
and
filling
d
this
is
an
approachable
beer
friendly
with
flavor
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
great
work
by
mcauslan
although
ive
had
this
in
bottles
many
times
the
draught
edition
was
excellent
stuff
another
superb
brew
from
montreal
among
canadas
best
drinkability
is
high
and
its
a
pleasure
to
have
an
low
alcohol
oatmeal
stout
thats
so
easy
to
drink
i
know
i
said
this
after
my
recent
terrapin
experience
but
damn
i
need
to
stop
neglecting
oatmeal
stouts
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
inches
of
brown
head
this
beer
is
dark
brownblack
in
color
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
not
that
great
i
get
some
stale
roasted
malt
that
almost
tastes
bunt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
would
prefer
it
be
more
viscous
i
like
stouts
but
this
one
probably
will
not
be
sampled
again
by
this
guy
served
in
a
guinness
pint
glass
thick
dark
black
appearance
with
a
foamy
brown
head
great
aroma
burnt
coffee
like
taste
is
rich
smoky
with
a
little
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
goes
down
quite
nicely
one
of
the
tastier
stouts
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
mcauslan
has
been
around
for
more
than
20
years
now
and
they
only
make
a
handful
of
beers
yet
they
all
seem
to
be
extraordinarily
well
made
there
are
a
lot
of
breweries
that
could
benefit
from
their
approach
notes
sacre
bleu
thank
you
quebec
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
nearly
perfect
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
even
beats
the
venerable
sam
smiths
in
my
book
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
and
i
will
still
take
an
ale
over
a
stout
any
day
but
this
is
one
good
beer
my
normal
complaint
about
stouts
is
the
mouthfeel
but
this
beer
is
not
overly
thick
and
the
aromas
and
taste
combinations
are
really
impressive
d
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
not
particularly
strong
on
the
alcohol
front
mixed
with
a
nice
depth
of
flavour
though
not
overpowering
and
its
a
pretty
smooth
feeling
stout
d
a
solid
and
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
extremely
sessionable
not
quite
the
standout
i
was
hoping
for
but
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
non
the
less
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
hope
to
do
so
again
in
the
near
future
d
sometimes
the
flavour
is
a
bit
burnt
instead
of
the
expected
roastedtoasted
which
hurts
its
drinkability
tastes
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
great
mouthfeel
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkablily
goes
i
could
see
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
very
flavorful
but
nothing
cloying
or
overbearing
overall
a
great
beer
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
awesome
i
get
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
with
some
cream
notes
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malt
and
cream
low
bitterness
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
doesnt
have
any
bitterness
from
the
coffee
or
roasted
malt
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
there
is
a
ton
of
flavor
in
this
beer
considering
it
is
only
5
percent
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
tried
it
but
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
portsmouth
oatmeal
stout
outstanding
beer
d
far
too
roasted
for
my
liking
its
missing
that
complimentary
sweetness
and
a
soft
smooth
mouthfeel
from
the
oats
that
seem

still
a
pretty
good

just
have
this
on

as
its
there
its

class

fairly
drinkable

good

too
sweet
for
me
i
couldnt

more

a

of

drinkability
not
to
shabby
for
a
style
that
i
dont
really
care
all
that
much
for
but
i
feel
that
this
one
is
pretty
well
done
and
really
has
an
excellent
scent
to
it
flavors
are
nice
with
the
exception
of
the
metallic
bite
definitely
worth
trying
like
i
said
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
the
style
one
of
my
all
time
favourites
nothing
bad
to
say
d
a
pretty
impressive
amount
of
flavor
for
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
very
sessionable
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
final
note
i
purchased
this
bttle
along
with
three
others
from
the
cellar
70
in
stevens
point
wisconsin
they
were
on
clearance
for
99
a
bottle
and
just
so
creamy
d
pretty
high
the
flavors
of
this
beer
are
tremendous
and
at
no
point
will
this
bore
anyone
i
deducted
a
bit
here
because
of
the
charred
flavor
that
to
me
lingers
and
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
great
cold
but
less
appealing
when
it
warmed
up
still
a
nice
and
complex
brew
overall
i
could
drink
this
all
night
not
as
intense
as
others
but
better
balanced
with
cleaner
flavors
this
is
terrific
oatmael
stout
i
still
enjoyed
it
but
the
drinkability
wasnt
quite
there
had
this
on
tap
at
novare
res
in
portland
me
poured
almost
pitch
black
and
completely
opaque
with
a
gorgeous
1
inch
chocolatemilk
looking
head
this
beer
tasted
absolutely
fantastic
basically
the
taste
is
as
if
one
took
the
darkest
chocolate
imaginable
and
melted
it
into
a
beer
with
very
very
slight
tart
undernotes
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
wonderfully
rich
and
creamy
some
might
say
its
a
bit
heavy
but
this
is
one
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
i
should
note
that
is
the
first
example
of
this
style
ive
tasted
so
i
may
be
a
bit
biased
in
my
review
due
to
lack
of
comparison
but
in
the
grand
and
majestic
scheme
of
what
beer
tastes
good
this
nails
it
for
me
really
just
an
outstanding
offering
in
my
opinion
the
smell
is
somewhat
dry
to
me
sweet
tangy
dark
dates
and
raisins
mixed
with
roasted
chocolate
and
almonds
very
subtle
and
pleasant
the
taste
is
changes
as
it
goes
down
it
starts
out
smooth
and
rich
then
develops
into
a
sharp
malty
fruity
blast
which
fades
on
the
finnish
back
to
smooth
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
nuts
and
fruit
lingering
for
the
thickness
of
the
beer
it
doesnt
coat
the
mouth
too
much
nor
was
it
as
dry
as
i
anticipated
it
goes
down
easy
for
a
stout
and
has
a
dull
sweetness
along
with
a
pleasant
tartness
not
quite
as
amazing
a
flavor
profile
as
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
but
something
closer
to
an
irish
dry
stout
and
for
me
that
isnt
bad
it
has
a
nice
balance
and
it
is
light
enough
so
it
doesnt
fatigue
you
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
just
fine
just
what
you
want
in
a
stout
very
easier
drinker
as
far
as
stouts
are
concerned
drinkability
in
terms
of
a
stout
it
is
nicely
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
few
in
a
session
that
said
i
am
cracking
2
right
now
d
could
very
well
be
the
benchmark
oatmeal
stout
for
me
just
fantastic
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
warm
opaque
sable
with
a
finebubbled
creamy
tan
head
the
smoky
malty
aroma
has
a
hint
of
mocha
and
spices
smoky
flavor
has
malty
and
yeasty
tones
as
well
as
hints
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
creamy
smooth
texture
is
a
little
fizzy
and
leaves
a
nice
tingle
dwow
this
could
be
the
easiest
drinking
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
ive
found
that
a
lot
of
breweries
tend
to
overdo
it
with
the
roasted
barley
in
oatmeal
stouts
but
this
is
nicely
balanced
ill
look
out
for
this
one
again
d
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
beer
which
isnt
overpowering
yet
still
packs
a
punch
of
flavour
this
is
highly
recommended
perfect
for
one
of
those
cool
autumn
evenings
though
just
as
enjoyable
on
a
summer
afternoon
beer
is
pretty
thick
and
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
i
dont
get
any
oatmeal
but
i
get
a
lot
of
body
and
some
roast
in
the
back
sweetness
is
up
front
and
the
whole
thing
is
well
balanced
second
carbonation
is
nice
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer

top
notch
oatmeal
stout
i
was
long
overdue
to
try
this
classic
oatmeal
stout
very
flavorful
although
the
intensity
of
roasted
malt
would
limit
how
many
of
these
i
would
put
down
many
enthusiastic
thumbs
up
d
extremely
quaffable
for
a
stout
of
this
ilk
its
not
filling
at
all
the
great
taste
and
high
drinkability
make
this
extremely
enjoyable
d
not
bad
classic
english
style
second
time
tasting
this
ontap
and
i
now
know
i
love
it
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
there
to
really
grab
me
i
cant
help
but
compare
it
to
the
only
other
oatmeal
stout
that
i
know
well
samuel
smiths
and
this
brew
is
behind
smiths
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
seems
that
the
best
way
to
enjoy
this
beer
is
on
nitro
all
the
best
reviews
are
by
those
who
have
had
it
that
way
im
going
to
seek
it
out
d
great
beer
for
after
dinner
or
the
end
of
the
night
d
decent
drinkability
these
beers
are
like
a
meal
in
themselves
so
i
personally
could
not
handle
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
overall
a
very
satisfying
beer
this
is
the
best
example
of
a
beer
on
nitrotap
ive
had
it
is
jet
black
with
half
an
inch
tan
head
that
stays
there
all
the
way
down
it
smells
of
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
in
there
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
great
sweetness
but
still
some
bitterness
so
smooth
that
i
finish
this
before
i
realize

to

for

a

with

substantial
lacing
is
left
by
the
head
though
the
nose
is
beautiful
molasses
coffee
oats
and
almost
a
berrylike
aroma
enticing
quite
a
nice
beer
a
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
the
roasty
goodness
of
a
rich
stout
finished
with
a
crisp
light
bitterness
with
every
sip
you
take
you
cant
help
but
catch
the
aroma
which
enhances
the
taste
beautifully
seems
appropriately
carbonated
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
thick
khaki
colored
head
has
a
nose
of
dark
chocolate
molasses
and
hints
of
coffee
or
espresso
has
a
rich
malty
and
chocolate
taste
up

then
goes
a
little
bitter
and
a
hint
of
sweet
at
the
end
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
great
for
this
type
of
stout
the
head
forms
a
collar
around
the
glass
as
time
goes
on
lots
of
sticky
lacing
great
drinkability
tasty
indeed
i
know
this
particular
beer
is
very
well
recieved
so
i
am
tentative
to
feel
so
poorly
about
it
but
i
am
quite
confident
in
this
review
its
unfortunate
but
this
oatmeal
stout
does
not
live
up
to
others
i
have
tried
this
brew
poured
to
a
completely
black
color
no
light
sneaking
through
this
one
thick
deep
tan
colored
head
hat
fills
the
english
pint
glass
the
froth
has
great
legs
a
part
of
it
sticks
around
for
the
entire
experience
the
amount
of
lacing
is
extensive
huge
amounts
of
clumps
at
the
top
and
then
sheets
as
this
beer
disappears
the
aromas
are
complex
dark
mallts
give
a
deep
roasted
and
slight
burnt
scent
that
is
reminiscent
of
coffee
and
chocolate
some
sweet
aroma
some
fruit
aromas
come
through
and
maybe
a
little
vanilla
excellent
roasted
flavor
that
highlight
the
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
that
was
noted
in
the
aroma
oat
flavor
seems
to
be
there
and
i
think
adds
to
some
of
the
smoothness
as
this
brew
has
a
very
creamy
feel
slight
fruit
presence
as
well
as
maybe
a
slight
vanilla
taste
as
i
said
earlier
has
a
very
creamy
feel
across
the
tongue
and
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
carbonation
is
not
extensive
which
is
perfect
for
this
brew
and
has
a
pretty
dry
finish
this
brew
is
excellent
one
of
the
nicest
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
will
have
to
pick
up
more
of
this
brew
though
at
the
price
it
might
be
somewhat
of
a
treat
considering
it
is
a
stout
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
its
the
perfect
balance
of
taste
between
the
malt
and
hops
it
would
seem
as
though
countless
hours
have
gone
into
creating
this
masterpiece
and
the
result
is
nothing
short
of
spectacular
i
guarantee
you
will
like
this
beer
d
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
with
clean
flavors
drinkability
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
highly
drinkable
stout
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
id
always
liked
this
in
bottles
but
found
it
to
be
a
lot
better
on
draft
from
the
11
5
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
bottling
or
expiration
date
sampled
on
january

2010
it
pours
extra
dark
brown
to
black
with
about
twi
fingers
of
puffy
laceenhancing
tan
head
that
lingers
for
quite
some
time
the
aroma
is
a
bit
unique
certainly
i
note
the
oatmeal
and
chocolate
malts
but
there
is
something
baked
and
raisinlike
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
the
taste
is
full
of
oatmeal
and
bread
with
a
vague
hoppy
sensation
and
a
dryer
ending
this
is
excellent
has
an
almost
smokey
taste
that
lingers
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
drinkability
is
good
light
enough
to
have
a
few
overall
this
went
down
way
too
easy
enjoyable
stout
for
sure
this
is
just
a
delicious
oatmeal
stout
with
plenty
to
offer
the
senses
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
a
good
looking
stout
that
ended
up
being
kind
of
a
let
down
dark
brown
with
a
strong
tan
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
this
beer
has
not
much
of
an
aroma
maybe
coffee
and
caramel
a
strong
bitterness
fades
into
the
familiar
chocolate
and
oats
flavor
for
the
style
with
a
slight
sweetness
throughout
this
stout
has
one
of
the
thinnest
bodies
of
any
stout
ive
ever
had
which
i
would
consider
the
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
i
usually
like
buying
them
in
singles
at
first
just
to
try
them
this
one
was
only
available
in
6
packs
im
glad
i
got
the
6
i
just
love
how
smooth
oatmeal
stouts
are
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
would
not
hesitate
to
get
more
of
these
and

gave
it
a
whirl

nice

this
beer
is
just
damn
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
smooth
loaded
with
flavor
and
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
only
thing
i
would
change
is
to
up
the
abv
so
it
has
a
bit
more
of
a
bite
to
it
but
its
pretty
damn
good
how
it
is
and
years
later
after
sampling
reviewing
even
brewing
many
many
beers
just
like
it
i
still
have
yet
to
figure
it
out
mmmmmmm
is
still
the
best
description
i
can
give
it
is
still
and
likely
always
will
be
a
mainstay
in

and
play
initiator
to

rich
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
cream
faint
hints
of
smoke
and
sark
fruit
taste
is
more
omplex
with
bitter
dark
chocolate
sweet
cream
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
definite
hop
presence
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
yet
not
coating
a
pleasure
to
drink
fantastically
rich
yet
quite
simple
and
pure
the
appearance
is
a
beautiful
clean
black
and
fills
the
room
with
a
wonderfully
roast
chocolate
and
oat
smell
round
and
crisp
very
much
full
bodied
in
smokiness
maltiness
and
flavor
there
is
not
an
overtly
viscous
taste
in
the
mouth
the
incredible
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
possesses
so
many
flavors
yet
remains
so
wellbalanced
oats
roasted
almonds
black
mole
scotch
grapefruit
and
smoked
meats
very
lightly
carbonated
but
wonderfully
drinkable
and
not
particularly
dry
round
and
smooth
really
excellent
drinkability
i
think
the
smell
got
me
through
to
the
end
of
the
beer
as
there
was
enough
to
experience
to
keep
things
interesting
this
one
was
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
also
not
a
fan
of
the
dark
chocolate
taste
so
it
is
unlikely
i
would
try
it
on
a
regular
basis
i
can
see
why
it
is
rated
as
highly
as
it
is
right
now
though
its
just
not
the
right
beer
for
me
surprisingly
thin
based
on
the
appearance
slightly
watered
down
with
very
slight
chewy
roasted
chocolate
malt
very
roasted
and
dry
with
a
lot
of
oatmeal
toffee
and
hazelnut
with
a
very
faint
hints
of
coffee
bean
toffee
subtle
hops
and
bourbon
there
is
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
lasts
throughout
and
compliments
the
roasty
bitter
dark
chocolate
notes
nicely
abv
is
unnoticeable
and
this
is
a
pretty
quaffable
session
beer
very
complex
for
a
beer
that
can
be
sessioned
bone
dry
finish
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
this
beer
is
pretty
average
i
was
very
disappointed
a
lovely
oatmeal
stout
would
make
a
brilliant
winter
session
beer
beer
poured
into
my
london
pride
pint
glass
it
easily
forms
a
3
inch
light
brown
head
plenty
of
lacing
and
froth
hug
the
glass
as
the
head
recedes
smell
is
oatmeal
naturally
along
with
maple
syrup
and
chocolate
really
enticing
taste
does
not
disappoint
a
roasted
bitterness
carries
itself
nicely
through
the
entire
drink
the
beer
never
turns
sweet
as
ive
seen
with
many
others
in
this
style
bittersweet
chocolate
also
lingers
on
the
palate
through
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
as
ive
almost
finished
it
over
the
course
of
the
past
5
minutes
highly
recommend
it
as
an
easy
drinking
stout
and
for
anybody
looking
to
branch
out
beyond
guinness
and
murphys
presuming
they
enjoy
oatmeal
like
flavors
of
course
d
very
high
lots
of
flavor
considering
the
abv
good
session
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
modest
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
like
a
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
was
not
as
much
bitter
as
sour
i
probably
served
this
too
cold
and
that
may
account
for
the
sour
flavor
it
went
away
and
bitter
replaced
it
as
the
beer
warmed
there
was
some
chocolate
as
well
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
smooth
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
ok
but
im
not
a
big
fan
d
it
is
very
good
the
bitterness
is
on
a
low
end
so
drinking
more
than
one
isnt
a
problem
its
a
nice
full
stout
without
the
high
alcohol
concentration
12
oz
somewhat
thin
appearing
almost
black
pour
some
cream
colored
head
laces
the
glass
okay
but
not
much
retention
quite
a
roasty
aroma
malt
and
coffee
and
some
oats
and
light
lactic
chocolate
a
little
light
bodied
but
still
thick
enough
a
definete
dryness
throughout
roasted
malt
light
coffee
rolled
oat
and
light
milk
chocolate
flavors
finish
is
a
little
bitter
then
a
bit
bland
extreamly
easy
drinking
did
not
find
this
as
filling
as
others
could
be
a
good
session
stout
if
available
to
you
its
rather
mild
in
terms
of
alcohol
so
you
could
pound
em
back
with
not
much
conciquence
its
rather
heavy
and
easy
to
fill
up
on
so
you
might
not
want
to
over
do
it
on
these
d
not
something
i
could
pound
back
all
night
but
is
a
beer
like
this
really
meant
for
that
type
of
consumption
a
great
oatmeal
stout
that
is
bestenjoyed
sipping
slowly
as
all
the
great
beers
are
12oz
bottle
near
solid
black
with
a
lasting
frothy
tan
head
im
amazed
that
this
is
only
5
alcohol
the
amount
of
flavor
and
body
almost
put
it
in
the
imperial
range
big
rich
caramel
sweetness
chocolatey
and
roasted
malt
flavors
finishes
dry
with
a
firm
yet
smooth
roasty
bitterness
full
and
silky
body
smells
of
rich
chocolate
mousse
everything
just
works
pretty
classic
canadian
beer
here
paired
well
with
the
irish
lamb
stew
i
made
tossed
a
bottle
in
tasted
good
in
there
too
versatile
beer
with
loads
of
relative
flavor
solid
all
around
its
exceptionally
drinkable
maintaining
great
interest
throughout
yet
being
light
enough
to
drink
a
lot
of
easily
all
around
a
pretty
typical
oatmeal
stout
with
accentuated
features
fantastic
flavor
and
a
perfect
amount
of
body
for
the
style
this
is
truly
a
world
class
oatmeal
stout
in
my
opinion
only
comparable
to
the
black
water
from
the
town
hall
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
another
four
pack
d
this
is
an
incredibly
flavorful
stout
for
5
it
is
something
i
definitely
plan
to
pick
up
again
very
nice
example
of
this
style
easy
to
drink
and
simply
welldone
marvelous
this
beer
is
very
nice
looking
with
a
one
finger
cappicino
laced
heada
dark
cola
colour
and
heaps
of
lacing
very
niceit
has
a
beautiful
aroma
of
mocha
coated
hopsit
has
an
above
average
creamy
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
oatsmocha
and
a
nice
bittersweet
finisha
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
and
will
buy
again
not
impressed
with
this
one
not
bad
at
all
but
the
particular
flavours
are
a
bit
offputting
because
of
their
strength
i
couldnt
and
wouldnt
drink
this
all
the
time
not
a
huge
beer
and
certainly
not
a
huge
stout
but
it
has
much
to
enjoy
and
its
subtlety
comes
with
the
benefit
of
increasing
its
drinkability
very
smooth
creamily
dark
and
good
for
a
couple
drinkability
compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
tried
this
one
is
pretty
average
it
is
inoffensive
on
the
way
down
but
the
aftertaste
just
did
not
agree
with
me
this
one
was
a
disappointment
d
a
well
brewed
stout
very
delicious
id
still
recommend
giving
this
a
try
however
final
thoughts
pretty
good
for
an
oatmeal
stout
doesnt
try
to
be
overbearing
but
has
enough
complexity
it
would
be
a
great
goto
for
the
oatmeal
stout
style
good
oats
sweetness
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
little
creamy
if
you
havent
had
it
before
i
would
recommend
great
for
a
darker
session
beer
surprisingly
overall
a
great
stout
doesnt
lack
in
flavor
and
complexity
but
doesnt
try
to
overdo
anything
i
would
be
happy
to
order
this
at
a
bar
any
day
over
guinness
the
silky
texutures
i
expect
but
that
smoke
maybe
phenolic
flavor
was
not
im
not
sure
if
this
is
an
added
complexity
to
the
beer
or
an
unwarrented
distraction
regardless
this
doesnt
kill
the
beer
nor
propell
it
into
greatness
either
probably
an
average
oatmeal
stout
but
with
that
odd
smokey
character
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
of
these
without
getting
too
tired
of
it
definitely
worth
checking
out
meh
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
thought
im
not
sure
that
it
benefitted
a
whole
lot
from
the
nitropour
still
its
worth
a
shot
nitro
or
not
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
tried
overall
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
what
it
lacks
in
alcohol
it
covers
up
in
flavor
will
definitely
buy
this
again
slightly
below
average
body
with
crisp
carbonation
this
is
nice
and
in
a
good
way
refreshing
for
a
stout
quite
drinkable
offering
lots
of
flavour
without
being
cloying
and
has
an
alcohol
level
that
means
you
can
and
want
to
have
more
than
1
11
5
oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
smells
a
little
like
like
cappuccino
wow
nice
flavor
to
match
the
aroma
not
so
much
overpowering
smoke
flavor
i
get
in
so
many
stouts
feels
good
swirling
around
my
mouth
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
overall
very
good
and
possibly
a
little
too
drinkable
d
drinks
very
easily
lots
of
flavor
bitterness
and
the
ensuing
dryness
in
the
mouth
makes
you
want
another
drink
immediately
after
each
preceding
drink
d
a
nice
balance
light
carbonation
and
not
filling
good
session
beer
d
overall
drinkability
was
pretty
decent
starting
off
good
but
perhaps
thinning
out
towards
the
end
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
put
down
a
couple
a
good
drinking
experience
but
honestly
not
one
that
will
stick
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
better
examples
the
next
time
im
out
looking
for
an
oatmeal
a
thick
consistency
low
alcohol
beer
with
a
chocolate
and
earth
quality
in
the
nose
i
feel
i
got
an
older
bottle
as
it
didnt
seem
as
bright
as
expected
palate
of
chocolate
and
a
very
mild
acidic
smokiness
not
really
fruity
in
the
combination
but
still
had
a
very
nice
body
a
leathery
finish
that
wasnt
very
dominating
the
acid
wasnt
extreme
and
the
beer
still
had
a
nice
creamy
quality
had
this
last
night
during
a
poker
game
poured
jet
black
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
smelled
of
caramel
malt
toffee
and
a
small
alcohol
kick
tasted
of
roasted
malts
very
smooth
just
slightly
overcarbonated
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
em
full
body
with
creamy
carbonation
very
smooth
d
quite
a
tasty
stout
at
5
would
probably
drink
again
a
great
beer
overall
very
solid
canadian
beer
makes
me
want
to
take
a
trip
to
montreal
for
a
weekend
d
very
nice
brew
for
sure
it
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
works
for
there
is
a
ton
of
butterscotch
coming
across
in
here
but
somehow
it
keeps
from
being
too
sweet
cloying
or
heavy
i
could
easily
down
2
or
three
of
these
in
an
evening
without
it
weighing
on
me
another
pretty
solid
brew
from
st
ambroise
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
a
little
tweak
here
or
there
to
add
some
slickness
to
the
mouthfeel
and
add
some
sweetness
but
thats
just
nitpicking
because
this
is
a
great
beer
edit
this
beer
on
nitrotap
is
unbelievable
dhugely
let
down
by
this
beer
might
have
to
drain
pour
it
because
of
the
aftertaste
this
beer
poured
a
thick
opaque
black
with
a
giant
3
finger
foamy
head
that
had
great
retention
nice
foamy
rings
of
lacing
were
left
behind
on
my
glass
nose
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
slightly
muted
oatmeal
notes
this
one
is
bitter
and
the
oats
come
out
much
better
at
the
taste
the
dark
roasted
malts
from
the
nose
is
more
in
the
backbone
theres
a
touch
of
sweetness
some
caramel
malts
in
the
finish
but
it
is
very
light
this
was
thinner
than
i
expected
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
decent
carbonation
for
the
style
slightly
creamy
going
down
this
beer
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
which
makes
it
a
way
more
sessionable
beer
stambroise
oatmeal
stout
from
mcauslan
brewing
pours
dark
in
my
glass
with
a
1
finger
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
chocolate
the
taste
really
hits
you
over
the
head
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
its
taste
of
malts
and
earthly
richness
make
my
mouth
water
an
unexpected
surprise
to
say
the
least
will
buy
again
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
almost
black
seems
very
thick
for
what
i
at
first
considered
to
be
a
runofthemill
oatmeal
stout
nice
whiff
of
coffee
off
the
top
that
and
sweet
malt
dominate
taste
is
fairly
straightforward
but
pleasant
sweet
malt
a
bit
short
on
roastiness
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
straightforward
but
it
translates
well
excellent
full
thick
mouthfeel
carries
the
day
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
not
too
much
to
overwhelm
but
not
too
little
to
make
it
flat
not
much
hops
here
at
all
even
in
the
end
very
drinkable
and
this
seemingly
straightforward
oatmeal
stout
has
more
than
meets
the
eye
d
decent
stuff
though
the
style
in
general
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
a
good
balance
between
roasty
bitterness
and
semisweet
caramelbutterscotchtoffee
flavors
medium
mouthfeel
with
the
perfect
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
d
its
incredibly
drinkable
even
for
an
oatmeal
stout
theres
a
lot
of
great
flavor
but
its
not
a
big
beer
by
any
measurement
this
is
truly
a
sessionable
stout
which
would
work
very
well
as
a
dessert
after
a
big
meal
a
great
find
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
final
verdict
its
good
i
can
foresee
another
six
pack
in
my
future
drinks
very
nicely
i
could
session
this
up
and
later
on
at
the
ron
hawkins
show
at
zaphods
that
evening
i
did
brought
a
few
home
in
bottles
as
well
and
it
plays
nice
there
too
this
is
solid
stuff
recommended
as
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
are
searching
for
something
different
i
will
definitely
be
having
this
again
as
it
is
probably
my
favorite
stout
when
its
on
tap
d
hard
to
imagine
a
better
bang
for
the
abv
stambroise
oatmeal
stout
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
half
inch
of
brown
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
creamy
chocolate
and
maybe
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
is
sharp
and
fairly
dry
with
plenty
of
roasted
character
bitterness
and
astringency
seem
to
come
equally
from
the
hops
and
malt
there
is
a
light
caramel
sweetness
but
it
is
overpowered
by
the
more
intense
dark
flavors
creamy
and
smooth
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
d
a
unique
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
brew
previously
in
the
top
100
as
a
stand
alone
stout
its
solid
d
a
very
drinkable
and
interesting
oatmeal
stout
i
wish
it
was
a
little
better
value
but
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
overall
a
great
canadian
offering
will
be
picking
this
up
again
d
interesting
offering
good
to
drink
on
its
own
or
with
some
good
steak
highly
recommended
d
im
still
a
little
new
to
the
oatmeal
stout
i
think
is
right
on
for
the
type
not
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
type
im
hoping
it
grows
on
me
i
can
say
that
the
low
abv
would
make
drinking
a
few
pretty
easy
the
brew
is
mediumbodied
with
superblymatched
carbonation
and
at
only
5
abv
is
a
truly
excellent
drinker
a
surprisingly
good
beer
ill
be
sure
to
revisit
soon
d
not
something
amazing
but
alright
dont
think
i
would
pick
up
a
sixer
but
still
worth
the
taste
d
one
round
deserves
another
very
drinkable
productone
of
the
best
beer
in
québec
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
jet
black
with
a
fingerthick
khaki
coloured
head
that
stayed
in
place
for
some
time
smell
is
dark
fruits
and
some
dark
roasted
malts
almost
reminds
me
of
a
baltic
porter
taste
was
rather
average
and
quite
honestly
a
bit
light
there
are
some
dark
malt
flavours
present
and
a
bit
of
smoke
toward
the
end
finish
was
moderately
bitter
not
a
very
complex
stout
at
all
mouthfeel
was
too
thin
imo
especially
considering
the
style
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
feel
this
brewery
could
do
better
im
crazy
about
their
apricot
wheat
ale
this
not
so
much
still
glad
i
tried
it
overall
a
great
stout
full
of
flavour
and
has
the
body
to
complement
it
this
will
be
my
new
goto
oatmeal
stout
this
is
my
first
beer
from
mcauslan
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
after
having
tried
this
one
drinkability
recommended
as
an
oatmeal
stout
charged
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
yet
still
manages
to
maintain
a
reasonable
abv
id
say
its
got
a
damned
high
degree
of
drinkability
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
dark
tan
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
oats
and
barley
with
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
fresh
coffee
it
tasted
like
bitter
coffee
and
burnt
oats
with
milk
chocolate
and
some
oak
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
smelled
fantastic
and
tasted
very
good
it
had
nice
body
and
was
quite
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
well
constructed
and
balanced
beer
but
perhaps
lacking
a
bit
of
depth
in
the
taste
to
make
it
truly
world
class
perhaps
it
is
just
me
but
this
beer
and
the
hitachino
espress
stout
both
tasted
very
odd
and
sweet
and
overly
figgy
and
fruity
not
much
of
a
roasty
character
at
all
in
the
flavor
or
aroma
disappointed
in
this
one
hopefully
the
rest
of
black
booty
will
not
disappoint
overall
this
is
one
tasty
brew
simple
yet
plenty
to
offer
done
perfectly
this
is
another
fine
product
that
id
recommend
to
anyone
to
try
out
that
enjoys
this
genre
of
beers
pours
an
inky
black
color
with
1
finger
of
foamy
burnt
tan
head
ok
retention
but
really
nice
lacing
smells
of
coffee
burnt
caramel
chocolate
and
oats
tastes
of
roasted
oats
coffee
chocolate
and
burnt
sugar
much
like
the
sugar
coating
on
creme
brulee
finishes
with
some
sourness
of
lactose
and
a
gentle
pop
of
earthy
hops
medium
in
body
with
low
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
burnt
and
roasty
with
a
touch
of
sour
as
well
as
sweetness
for
a
unique
feel
and
good
balance
when
i
want
a
stout
that
is
a
little
bit
different
from
the
rest
but
still
has
it
all
this
would
be
among
my
top
selections
satisfying
very
easy
to
drink
and
low
in
alcohol
so
it
leaves
more
room
for
another
or
something
totally
different
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
oatmeal
stout
that
ive
ever
had
based
on
it
being
top
3
rated
by
reviewers
i
have
to
agree
it
rivals
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
being
my
favorite
version
of
this
style
especially
for
2
50
a
bottle9
99
a
4pack
what
a
deal
will
be
buying
this
in
my
local
liquor
store
and
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
d
quite
drinkable
but
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
give
this
part
a
higher
score
i
can
still
easily
have
a
few
of
these
though
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
id
search
this
out
for
a
try
its
the
most
oatmealy
stout
ive
had
in
a
while
and
the
price
is
right
for
a
12oz
bottle
i
think
its
around
2
50
overall
a
reasonably
tasty
oatmeal
stout
with
fantastic
drinkability
a
little
bit
more
bite
in
the
backend
would
make
this
a
truly
exceptional
brew
those
oats
really
do
there
job
in
the
body
department
both
bolstering
head
retention
and
providing
a
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
a
welcome
addition
to
the
category
one
ill
definitely
try
again
if
given
the
chance
overall
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
extremely
enjoyable
though
the
powerful
assertive
flavors
and
aromas
might
make
it
too
overwhelming
to
session
this
is
the
only
drawback
to
what
is
otherwise
a
prize
accomplishment
of
the
brewing
industry
well
done
mcauslan
pours
a
dark
black
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
with
good
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
mostly
oatmeal
some
caramel
fits
the
style
smooth
chewy
and
low
carbonation
tastes
strongly
of
roasted
malts
not
too
much
coffee
but
of
course
more
of
an
oatmeal
theres
also
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
overall
a
pretty
tasty
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
ive
learned
to
tolerate
coffee
flavors
but
not
the
scorching
carbonizing
of
everything
else
in
the
vicinity
there
are
better
uses
for
napalm
then
incinerating
malt
like
terrorists
poured
a
midnight
like
color
with
a
beautiful
dark
head
that
left
beautiful
lacing
as
i
drank
it
smelled
of
graham
crackers
dark
chocolate
and
some
coffee
was
very
smooth
with
hints
of
molasses
and
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
very
smooth
that
finished
dry
very
drinkable
especially
with
the
low

abv
definitely
will
drink
again
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
half
inch
cap
of
lacing
which
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
graham
cracker
milk
chocolate
cream
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
has
more
roasted
malt
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
appropriately
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again

overall
a
great
stout
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
stout
hint
of
sweetness
that
complements
the
beer
nicely
overall
one
of
the
few
session
stouts
that
ive
encountered
i
could
drink
56
of
these
no
problem
plenty
of
oatmeal
chocolate
and
espresso
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
the
hop
bitterness
adds
complexity
a
tasty
original
take
on
the
style
pours
black
with
a
short
but
thick
tan
head
oaty
malty
chocolate
nose
the
espresso
saves
itself
for
the
taste
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
sweet
creamiiness
licorice
molasses
and
a
roasty
dryness
comes
with
the
finish
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
for
the
style
but
still
a
really
good
beer
d
woah
just
wow
a
beer
with
this
much
delicious
character
at
5
damn
will
drink
again
d
really
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
have
any
problems
having
some
of
these
in
a
rows
only
barriers
is
the
strong
oatmeal
taste
that
can
turn
off
some
people
after
some
time

on

d
nice
brew
here
on
a
warm
night
very
different
if
drink
cold
or
temp
worth
trying
probably
wont
buy
again
i
poured
this
strong
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
about
as
black
as
black
can
get
like
used
motor
oil
the
beer
had
no
head
whats
so
ever
save
for
a
thin
brown
scum
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
the
taste
was
strong
and
acrid
to
me
me
ilove
oatmeal
stouts
but
this
one
was
way
harsh
i
thought
i
will
not
buy
again
the
feel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
not
bad
nice
sessionable
stout
overall
not
as
sweet
as
the
nitrodraft
version
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
drank
well
with
my
breakfast
of
croissants
and
oatmeal
very
nice
to
drink
smooth
and
balanced
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
highly
recommend
would
love
to
try
again
very
impressed
but
more
of
a
celebration
stout
because
of
the
hefty
price
tag
one
a
day
beer
staple
is
a
thought
hmmm
from
canada
eh
hell
yas
d
due
to
the
harshness
this
beer
isnt
very
drinkable
it
could
perhaps
be
a
good
accompaniment
for
desserts
or
used
in
cooking
notes
not
may
favorite
stout
but
a
reasonable
option
and
i
would
recommend
stout
fans
trying
it
at
least
i
question
how
available
it
is
however
i
bought
a
sixer
at
chucks
in
chagrin
falls
but
he
said
that
mine
was
one
of
the
last
d
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
great
taste
and
great
finish
this
stout
pours
a
very
nearly
opaque
black
with
the
slightest
touch
of
ruby
on
the
edges
when
held
up
to
light
a
nice
brown
tan
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
ton
of
sticky
lacing
on
my
glass
smell
is
of
milky
chocolate
lots
of
beautiful
coffee
notes
and
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
minerally
brightness
in
the
background
must
be
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
smooth
finish
this
is
my
goto
session
stout
all
the
right
flavours
are
there
and
since
its
not
too
ridiculously
heavy
i
can
handle
a
few
of
these
easily
really
solid
stout
from
a
great
quebec
brewery
what
an
excellent
surprise
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
mochatan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
way
down
smells
vinous
with
dried
fruits
like
raisin
plum
and
prune
coming
to
mind
a
bit
of
roast
and
chocolate
hidden
in
there
too
tastes
about
like
youd
expect
a
bit
fruity
some
roast
then
some
chocolate
creamy
to
oily
in
the
mouth
crisp
carbonation
solid
body
great
brew
im
impressed
a
pretty
hefty
contender
for
best
in
class
maybe
a
few
deducted
points
for
sensory
faults
but
overall
a
pretty
stellar
stout
from
la
belle
province
overall
didnt
have
coffee
this
morning
so
i
had
this
instead
good
replacement
i
was
hoping
this
was
gonna
be
good
and
it
lived
up
to
my
hype
d
very
drinkable
the
low
abv
would
make
it
easy
to
drink
a
couple
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
throughout
the
evening
what
an
outstanding
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
must
have
more
of
their
beer
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
and
a
good
sessionable
beer
its
great
on
a
cool
fall
day
the
colder
it
gets
outside
in
the
winter
the
more
i
crave

not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
but
its
quite
nice
d
this
is
a

drinkable
stout
a
little
pricey
but
well
worth
splurging
on
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts

oatmeal
stout
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
firm
tan

there
are
brownish
red
highlights
up
to
the
light
and
the
head
reduces
to
a
tan
ring
with
time
the
smell
is
very
pleasant
aromas
of
smooth
oats
malt
and
sweetness
initial
pour
yields
a
moderately
intense
sense
that
vastly
improves
as
this
brew
finishes
taste
is
great
and
an
all
around
example
of
well
blended
malts
and
oats
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
big
roastiness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
on
the
lighter
to
medium
density
side
with
a
tight
carbonation
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
the
last
of
the
finish
was
a
touch
bitter
and
sticky
but
ultimately
this
is
one
fine
well
brewed
stout
a
rich
coffie
dark
roast
fills
my
lips
first
hints
of
baking
coco
and
burnt
to
an
asoum

flavor
comes
in
strong
soon
their
after
at
the
end
their
is
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
that
takes
over
this
is
a
beer
that
improves
as
it
warmes
i
will
drink
this
one
agan
for
sure
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
am
i
missing
something
not
following
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
a
really
good
oatmeal
stout
is
hard
to
find
i
dont
think
ive
had
one
this
good
since
i
could
get
ipswitch
on
a
regular
basis
glad
to
see
this
get
more
distribution
d
huge
possibilities
but
nice
enough
no
balance
in
general
way
out
of
tune
drinks
great
remember
enjoying
this
in
the
early
90s
still
great
drinkability
solid
and
something
id
buy
again
but
i
expected
to
blown
away
considering
the
super
high
ratings
regardless
of
that
however
i
did
enjoy
this
and
its
certainly
a
solid
version
of
the
style
a
bigger
bolder
version
even
pours
super
dark
brown
with
a
great
frothy
brown
head
of
hair
the
nose
is
dark
roasted
malts
red
fruits
like
dark
cherries
a
very
sticky
toffee
smell
pralines
chocolate
covered
peanuts
the
taste
is
metallic
malts
giving
it
a
lil
lower
score
dark
fruits
very
smoothe
very
round
finish
roasty
malts
almost
no
carbo
like
a
very
smoothe
scotch
ale
full
bodied
deelish
bought
from
ls
been
wanting
this
for
quite
a
bit
very
roasty
and
smooth
like
silk
my
friend
for
an
oatmeal
is
quite
meaty
a
sticky
sweet
brew
pours
a
black
of
the
blackest
brown
head
is
in
the
clouds
it
lives
up
to
its
high
score
one
of
the
nicest
oatmeals
out
there
d
average
abv
great
taste
but
the
fact
i
cant
get
this
locally
at
all
will
limit
how
much
i
can
actually
drink
still
distribution
should
not
be
a
factor
in
reviewing
a
beers
qualities
this
is
an
intense
beer
big
mouthfeel
big
bellyfull
big
flavours
not
an
everyday
brew
but
damn
its
good
when
you
feel
like
indulging
d
if
youre
into
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
a
beer
to
try
its
never
overbearing
the
way
stouts
can
be
and
it
goes
down
easy
a
very
good
brew
i
really
like
this
oatmeal
stout
its
definitely
at
the
top
of
my
list
as
far
as
stouts
go
very
drinkable
will
pick
up
another
one
of
these
in
the
near
future
a
dark
thick
black
body
with
a
somewhat
tan
head
and
some
lace
patches
a
mild
smell
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
a
smooth
and
creamy
medium
to
full
body
that
has
tasty
roasted
and
coffee
malts
for
a
good
dry
backbite
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
and
it
is
worth
trying
overall
this
is
one
quality
oatmeal
stout
the
lower
abv
makes
this
extremely
sessionable
highly
recommend
first
oatmeal
stout
i
have
tried
and
let
me
tell
you
wow
not
what
i
was
expecting
comparing
it
to
beamish
murphys
or
guiness
this
is
a
whole
new
ball
game
i
found
that
the
scent
alone
jumped
out
at
me
and
had
this
very
pungent
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
smell
at
first
i
didnt
enjoy
the
strength
of
the
smell
but
it
grew
on
me
had
a
very
dark
colour
to
it
and
a
interesting
off
white
head
very
full
felling
when
you
drink
it
really
neat
texture
and
feel
to
it
wouldnt
buy
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
a
nice
beer
to
have
after
work
or
with
a
burger
so
it
pours
a
very
dark
chocolate
color
it
has
big
head
on
the
pour
more
than
i
would
expect
the
aroma
is
malty
and
roasted
caramel
i
really
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
the
smell
my
first
sip
and
i
can
taste
the
fullness
of
this
beer
the
malt
characteristics
is
minor
at
least
less
than
i
had
expected
i
dont
really
pick
up
any
roasted
character
either
it
is
almost
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
which
is
kind
of
disappointing
i
dont
really
get
any
after
taste
on
this
either
it
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
much
better

this
is
a

try
to
escape
its
greatness
try
to
hate
it
you
cant
there
is
no
better
oatmeal
stout
out
there
dont
even
bother
looking
d
great
stout
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
for
a
stout
lover
pours
a
dark
cocoa
with
a
thin
milky
way
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
film
smell
is
sweet
and
dominates
rum
raisins
molasses
whole
wheat
bread
raspberries
milk
chocolate
taste
is
just
as
sweet
with
a
subtle
oaty
finish
begins
with
sweet
brown
sugar
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
before
transforming
into
a
nice
mixture
of
rum
figs
black
berries
wheat
bread
oatmeal
and
a
clean
grassy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
soapy
quite
carbonated
and
finishes
moderately
creamy
a
real
o
g
in
the
craft
community
thanks
for
the
opportunity
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
top
rated
beer
the
toasty
finish
perfectly
complements
the
sweeter
flavors
at
the
onset
its
great
complexity
and
great
balance
at
the
same
time
if
this
brewer
can
pack
this
much
goodness
into
a
5
stout
it
makes
me
wonder
why
other
places
arent
doing
enough
of
the
same
this
is
hands
down
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
ever
tasted
dfor
an
almost
mass
produced
brew
this
is
a
rather
satisfying
oatmeal
stout
for
the
price
and
availability
i
would
chose
this
over
those
irish
dry
stouts
any
day
d
a
very
tasty
stout
i
like
the
rich
flavors
and
complexity
of
the
palate
as
well
as
it
refreshing
character
i
would
recommend
and
session
this
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
brownblack
opaque
with
a
thick
frothy
medium
brown
3
finger
head
the
head
dissipated
but
left
a
nice
layer
and
clung
fairly
well
to
the
sides
the
aroma
was
very
slightly
sweet
almost
like
a
dark
chocolate
covered
cherry
touches
of
brown
sugar
and
oatmeal
wheat
bread
taste
was
slightly
burnt
stale
bread
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
outstanding
felt
slightly
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
acidic
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
the
toungue
pleasant
to
drink
went
down
extremely
smooth
hv
glad
i
tried
this
one
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
taste
is
of
chocolate
and
coffee
nice
roasted
malts
here
a
light
fruity
hoppiness
is
noticeable
towards
the
finish
after
taste
is
a
little
mochalike
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
this
instantly
became
one
of
my
favorite
stouts

very
good

thanks
again
joe
this
is
one
fun
beer
to
drink
pours
black
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
some
scattered
lacing
the
head
sticks
around
as
a
thin
cap
smells
dry
and
earthy
with
some
light
roastiness
and
some
aromas
of
dry
forest
leaves
beautifully
balanced
flavors
earthy
dry
lightly
roasty
creamy
powdery
chocolate
silky
from
the
oatmeal
and
very
moderate
alcohol
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
satisfying
d
given
that
this
is
readily
available
now
in
my
area
and
particularly
given
its
low
abv
this
could
become
a
standard
in
my
house
this
is
simply
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
if
you
like
stouts
in
any
capacity
you
definitely
need
to
try
this
its
a
bit
pricey
as
i
paid
2
89
for
the
single
11
5
oz
bottle
otherwise
i
could
make
it
an
everyday
drinker
regardless
its
a
great
stout
and
one
of
the
best
canadian
beers
ive
had
highly
recommended
this
is
a
paramount
example
of
the
style
bottle
this
beer
poured
almost
jet
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
did
not
last
too
long
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavor
is
of
roasted
coffee
that
is
balanced
by
the
oatmeal
sweetness
very
robust
mouthfeel
is
excellent
drinkability
is
good
tastes
a
lot
like
by
homebrewed
oatmeal
stout
starts
off
creamy
and
smooth
with
light
roasted
coffee
bitterness
becomes
more
chocolatey
and
toffeeish
slight
cardboard
flavor
but
just
barely
substantial
licorice
flavor
throughout
dark
chocolate
bittersweetness
closes
out
the
palate
suggestions
of
dark
fruit
linger
mediumfull
body
with

very
nice
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
years
ago
and
i
am
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
it
again
great
oatmeal
stout
d
not
bad
tons
of
flavor
mentally
i
am
getting
out
of
a
stout
mode
with
the
weather
warming
good
beer
though
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
would
definitely
consider
getting
again
m
d
rich
bodied
a
little
bit
of
a
surprising
bitterness
finishes
just
enough
coating
of
the
mouth
to
hold
onto
the
flavours
for
a
while
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
not
quite
like
a
few
of
the
others
ive
had
in
recent
memory
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
good
enough
to
leave
me
feeling
proud
that
it
comes
from
canada
nicely
done
this
is
among
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
it
pours
extremely
dark
and
kicks
up
a
rocky
chunky
head
taste
is
remarkably
intense
and
interesting
with
big
dark
malt
flavors
up
front
mouthfeel
is
silky
with
the
slightest
dry
finish
very
very
mild
hop
notes
in
the
aftertaste
it
simply
is
quite
hard
to
do
better
than
this
for
a
pure
oatmeal
stout
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
black
with
a
very
nice
bubbly
head
of
one
inch
with
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
contains
some
dark
coffees
hints
of
oatmeal
a
bit
of
a
burnt
roasted
malt
to
it
the
coffee
is
a
little
more
palatable
the
carbonation
lifting
some
sting
off
of
the
slightly
charred
roasted
malt
molasses
and
then
a
more
soft
espresso
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
refined
subtle
beer
but
this
is
delightfully
ballsy
d
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
extremely
drinkable
as
stouts
go
dont
really
like
this
for
some
reason
it
is
something
about
the
separate
parts
just
not
mixing
well
together
not
a
favorite
drinkability
has
good
flavor
for
an
oatmeal
stout
this
one
is
really
deep
and
malty
a
very
good
stout
here
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
a
single
this
is
something
i
will
revisit
pours
out
nearly
black
with
a
chocolate
milk
head
that
leaves
some
fantastic
lacing
nose
is
kind
of
typical
with
the
whole
chocolate
coffee
and
dried
fruit
thing
theres
kind
of
a
gym
sock
smell
to
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
least
favorite
sam
adams
beers
lots
of
molasses
as
well
flavor
doesnt
suffer
from
the
sock
molasses
comes
out
a
lot
more
than
the
chocolate
and
roast
raisins
come
out
more
in
the
finish
has
an
odd
flat
yeastiness
in
the
finish
which
seems
to
be
a
recurring
trend
with
this
brewerys
beers
mouthfeel
has
a
really
nice
full
body
from
the
oats
the
carbonation
could
be
a
little
calmer
solid
drinkability
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
feels
unbalanced
to
me
i
love
me
some
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
dont
think
this
is
the
one
for
me
5
is
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
very
easy
drinker
but
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
to
sit
and
ponder
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
good
drink
at
the
end
of
brunch
d
extremely
smooth
and
a
great
example
of
what
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
i
really
liked
the
interplay
of
the
roasted
and
sweet
notes
of
this
and
with
only
a
5
abv
this
is
one
hugely
tasty
and
sessionable
stout
after
i
finished
this
i
immediately
wanted
another
one
good
stuff
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
flavorful
session
ales
in
existence
big
and
aggressive
without
compromising
drinkability
d
a
low
abv
stout
with
a
robust
flavor
what
more
does
man
need
this
is
now
available
in
pa
so
im
gonna
have
to
stock
up
solidly
mediumbodied
and
creamy
this
goes
down
quite
easily
with
a
surprising
smoothness
despite
steely
notes
pours
black
with
a
nice
creamy
and
fizzy
tan
head
smell
is
light
coffee
perhaps
some
milkiness
and
oatmeal
taste
is
dark
roastiness
and
moderate
strength
flavorful
coffee
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
slight
creamy
milky
underlying
flavor
to
it
but
still
id
like
it
to
be
a
touch
richer
in
body
very
good
all
around
and
quite
drinkable
thanks
jan
one
could
say
the
crown
jewel
in
the
mcauslan
crown
pours
a
nurky
black
with
some
very
dark
brownhighlights
only
at
the
tippy
top
of
the
beer
when
held
to
the
light
middle
way
filmy
foam
and
a
light
ring
of
foam
the
aroma
is
a
butterscotchy
roasted
wheat
bread
bread
with
a
little
smokey
peatiness
to
it
the
first
sip
is
an
upfront
buttery
mlat
mixed
with
roated
almonds
the
middle
is
more
smokey
and
brings
out
a
better
defined
roasted
quality
of
the
malt
along
with
the
balancing
of
the
hops
very
velvety
feel
to
this
palate
with
a
creamy
backbone
best
not
forget
the
caramel
great
beer
d
i
had
to
keep
checking
the
bottle
to
make
sure
it
actually
said
5
0
abv
because
this
feels
like
a
much
bigger
beer
in
my
opinion
this
stout
could
benefit
greatly
from
the
addition
of
a
little
sweetness
and
the
subtraction
of
some
of
the
bitter
roasted
smokiness
medium
bodied
and
silky
smooth
perfect
on
the
tongue
not
too
thick
but
rich
and
creamy
goes
down
easy
and
great
flavor
all
at
5
abv
great
stuff
a
real
nice
session
stout
drinkability
on
this
one
is
great
especially
at
only
5
abv
i
certainly
wouldnt
suggest
going
to
something
light
after
this
but
having
a
few
of
these
would
be
no
problem
pours
a
very
thick
oily
jet
black
body
hosting
an
inch
and
a
half
of
rich
tan
head
it
leaves
an
almost
solid
wall
of
lace
as
it
fades
woiw
is
what
i
think
of
when
all
the
aromas
reach
my
nose
like
fresh
baked
sweet
bread
carmalized
malt
toffee
vanilla
and
esspresso
i
could
just
smell
this
one
all
night
enters
the
mouth
a
litttle
thinner
than
i
expected
along
with
some
scattered
mediciney
tones
a
bit
of
soured
bittered
shrill
asheyness
is
left
on
the
tongue
this
brew
is
no
where
near
as
tastey
as
the
nose
lead
me
to
believe
it
really
lacks
the
creamy
roasty
richness
that
i
would
have
loved
to
have
had
accompany
the
nose
it
does
show
a
little
bit
of
aht
carmalized
malt
on
the
mouthfeel
nicely
drinkable
overall
though
recommended
first
time
i
came
across
this
beer
was
at
cest
what
in
toronto
ca
and
needless
to
say
i
feel
in
love
with
the
draft
version
there
that
was
about
45
years
ago
many
stouts
later
and
this
time
its
a
bottle
sample
appearance
is
black
it
absorbs
all
visible
light
forms
a
dark
tan
thicket
of
head
with
great
retention
after
dwindling
slowly
it
forms
a
tight
collar
of
lace
on
the
rim
of
my
gulden
draak
chalice
and
with
each
sip
fine
speckled
lacing
is
left
behind
aroma
tartness
with
mild
metallic
notes
and
dark
powdered
chocolate
really
dry
and
not
much
like
i
remember
the
draft
softness
of
the
oatmeal
additions
to
come
across
in
the
nose
definitely
some
cereal
grains
outside
of
patent
black
roasted
malts
the
oatmeal
is
kicking
just
subdued
by
the
dark
roasts
no
real
hop
aromatics
here
somewhat
tart
and
lactic
with
mild
oxidation
noted
no
date
on
the
bottle
here
but
again
not
what
i
recall
in
my
beer
memory
dark
roasts
with
bitterness
something
practically
burnt
with
these
strange
tart
notes
surfing
around
no
real
complex
fruitiness
just
a
mild
funk
brewing
mild
chocolate
and
coffee
more
so
just
dark
bakers
chocolate
with
a
powdered
cocoa
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
somewhat
creamy
textured
carbonation
is
mellow
and
smooth
no
complaints
in
this
department
finishes
exuberantly
dry
drinkability
is
okay
im
a
fan
of
the
draft
version
i
wont
give
up
on
the
beauty
of
this
beer
that
i
recall
on
tap
in
toronto
but
the
bottled
version
was
pale
in
comparison
if
very
dry
coffeeish
beers
are
your
preference
than
this
will
be
a
clear
winner
a
very
tasty
stout
relatively
mild
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
roast
cheers
pours
a
very
dark
brown
pretty
much
black
in
color
smell
is
roasted
coffee
and
some
oatmeal
very
nice
plenty
of
webby
lacing
on
side
of
the
glass
taste
is
mostly
the
same
as
the
nose
but
much
more
astringent
coffee
in
the
taste
pretty
bitter
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
this
is
a
nice
full
bodied
oatmeal
stout
nice
smokey
feel
w
good
flavors
to
compliment
this
ranks
near
the
top
of
my
favorite
stouts
short
of
brewpups
or
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
this
is
hands
down
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
every
had
fresh
grains
the
perfect
toasted
burt
coffee
level
just
a
perfect
session
oatmeal
stout
no
wonder
its
almost
12
a
4
pack
d
i
pick
up
characteristics
of
a
sweet
stout
and
dry
stout
that
are
belnded
nicely
very
flavorful
and
tasty
making
it
easy
to
drink
at
5
abv
drinkability
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
because
it
is
surprisingly
unusual
and
has
some
flavors
that
i
dont
particularly
like
in
quantity
nevertheless
worth
seeking
out
pours
pitch
black
with
some
tan
head
nice
roasted
nose
caramel
sweetness
is
there
as
well
flavor
is
very
robust
and
thick
minor
smoked
tone
on
the
backside
feel
is
thick
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
biting
but
not
heavily
present
this
is
a
very
robust
stout
not
my
favorite
of
all
time
but
its
good
pours
a
black
color
nice
carbonation
huge
twofinger
plus
creamy
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
slight
roastyness

slight
chocolate
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
some
roastyness

on
toffeechocolate
and
some
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
way
to
to
canada
lol
decent
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
between
the
overwhelming
roast
presence
the
intense
bitterness
and
the
less
than
appealing
mouthfeel
this
brew
turned
out
to
be
a
difficult
one
to
put
down
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
may
need
a
touch
of
sugar
and
perhaps
some
more
alcohol
content
to
come
to
fruition
it
is
very
good
for
what
it
is
now
however
definitely
try
it
st
ambroise
oatmeal
stout
is
the
most
surprising
beer
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
thats
mostly
due
to
the
fact
that
i
had
no
expectations
when
the
cap
was
cracked
this
is
my
new
favorite
version
of
the
style
hands
down
highly
recommended
if
you
like
the
peat
smelltaste
you
could
drink
this
pretty
easy
as
a
session
beer
but
i
couldnt
get
past
the
smell
to
drink
more
than
one
one
was
all
i
could
do
a
good
oatmeal
stout
a
great
finish
to
the
day
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
mouth
feel
though
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
black
as
oil
with
one
finger
of
head
that
faded
fast
roasted
smell
mouthfell
feel
and
taste
were
the
weakest
both
seemed
to
be
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
i
always
see
it
when
i
go
for
beer
today
was
finally
the
day
i
bought
a
6pk
drinkability
is
okay
i
could
have
a
few
seeing
as
it
is
only
five
percent
i
am
sure
it
would
be
better
on
tap
overall
and
excellent
brew
with
great
character
highly
recommended
still
fairly
drinkable
considering
its
medium
body
age
and
balanced
complexity
of
this
brew
sessionable
although
stout
novices
may
have
a
harder
time
knocking
a
few
of
these
roasty
treats
back
if
fresh
highly
recommended
if
past
its
best
by
date
shame
on
you
and
me
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
impression
a
roasty
flavorful
oatmeal
stout
the
diacetyl
definitely
detracts
but
its
a
background
note
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
much
more
than
a
pint
worth
a
try
i
suppose
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
porter
that
i
really
enjoyed
really
robust
and
enjoyable
with
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
the
only
down
side
to
this
brew
is
a
bit
of
lasting
sweetness
that
tends
to
linger
definitely
a
good
beer
otherwise
that
im
glad
to
have
enjoyed
big
thanks
to
beertruth
di
have
to
say
this
is
delicious
and
unique
i
really
enjoy
how
none
of
the
usual
stout
tastes
stand
out
and
there
is
a
fantastic
balance
if
only
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
richer
this
would
be
truly
worldclass
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a

dark
brown
head
above
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
dwelling
coating
lace
aroma
is
sweet
roasted
dark
malts
taste
is
like
the
nose
dominated
by
sweet
dark
grain
with
some
coffee
bitterness
mainly
noticed
at
the
close
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
drinkability
is
superb
gotta
love
an
easy
drinking
chewy
dark
brew
especially
one
with
an
abv
that
would
allow
a
session
if
i
had
more
than
one
of
course
dark
dense
and
full
head
over
complete
dark
liquid
bitter
aroma
of
burnt
roasted
coffee
that
transfers
to
the
tongue
fullbodied
and
creamy
this
has
a
slightly
unpleasant
acidic
finish
this
doesnt
win
high
favor
with
me
as
it
shows
no
real
distinction
with
other
breakfast
stouts
that
can
claim
statelinessnobility
in
this
category
and
doesnt
amplify
any
great
complexities
with
that
said
this
is
nice
to
drink
light
dark
fruit
nuances
mingle
with
charred
malt
and
is
quite
sessionable
taste
is
roasted
and
burned
in
a
mild
way
and
at
the
right
level
this
gives
the
beer
a
coffee
and
melasses
taste
as
the
smell
promised
the
oatmeal
adds
so
much
taste
of
grain
cereal
and
a
nice
deep
oiliness
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
very
nice
beer
the
biggest
detraction
i
have
is
the
lack
of
a
finish
in
the
taste
its
very
good
and
interesting
and
then
just
falls
off
nonetheless
a
very
good
beer
thats
worth
seeking
out
full
bodied
and
thick
with
a
just
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
texture
the
moderate
carbonation
lightens
the
brew
up
a
bit
but
theres
still
a
slightly
smokyacidic
heaviness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
really
distinctive
i
cant
think
of
a
beer
to
compare
it
to
and
that
is
certainly
a
good
thing
in
my
book
unquestionably
one
of
the
top
beers
of
the
style
i
felt
that
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
especially
with
this
being
an
oatmeal
stout
overalli
am
glad
i
stumbled
upon
this
on
this
trip
to
toronto
i
hadnt
heard
of
it
before
and
now
i
see
it
is
on
the
cusp
of
the
top
100
so
now
my
unbiased
opinion
is
that
it
is
little
overated
it
is
good
but
not
great
12oz

pretty
good
it
smells
like
roasted

coffee
oatsoatmeal
and
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
finish
after
a
few
drinks
the
sweet
oatmeal
really
comes
out
in
the
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
too
its
nice
and
smooth
and
at
only
5
abv
its
very
sessionable
too
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
it
was
a
nice
surprise
to
find
a
4
pack
of

edit

with
what
im
presuming
is
a
much
fresher
bottle
the
signs
of
age
are
much
lower
the
fruitiness
and
licorice
of
my
last
bottle
partially
give
way
to
bitter
scorched
grains
i
need
to
lower
my
mouthfeel
score
as
the
age
seemed
to
have
helped
by
previous
one
with
my
current
bottle
not
being
as
smooth
drinkability
with
this
one
is
up
there
fairly
simple
and
sophisticated
and
at
a
lower
abv
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
brilliant
satisfying
stout
that
sets
the
standard
terrific
all
around
has
been
a
favourite
for
a
couple
years
now
becoming
more
affordable
every
day
and
at
5
its
suitable
for
any
occasion
this
is
a
decent
stout
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
my
favourite
stout
so
far
theres
just
something
about
that
thick
lush
soft
caramel
taste
ever
so
slightly
burnt
the
syrupy
consistency
the
fine
yet
balanced
carbonation
it
looks
almost
like
an
espresso
with
a
fine
mist
of
crema
on
top
almost
completely
opaque
and
even
the
taste
is
vaguely
reminiscent
of
coffee
not
strong
or
unpleasant
in
any
way
the
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
just
an
allaround
wonderful
beer
poured
opaque
brownish
black
syrupy
like
molasses
with
a
little
bit
of
brownish
offwhite
head
smell
is
toasted
marshmallow
alcohol
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
coffee
bitter
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
burn
at
the
end
acidic
almost
medicinal
aftertaste
but
all
in
all
one
of
my
favourite
stouts
ein
prosit
der
gemütlichkeit
let
this
one
continue
to
warm
for
more
exciting
discoveries
in
both
aroma
and
taste
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
may
spend
more
time
smelling
than
sipping
does
the
taste
live
up
to
the
heavenly
nose
it
is
on
the
light
side
of
things
as
the
alcohol
percentage
suggests
this
is
a
fairly
light
beer
on
the
tongue
it
does
not
have
the
thick
maltiness
that
one
would
find
in
an
imperial
stout
that
would
have
a
nose
like
this
beer
does
having
said
that
the
heft
of
this
beer
perfectly
lives
up
to
the
5
alcohol
this
beer
is
an
expressive
mix
of
roasted
barley
dark
roast
coffee
even
espresso
and
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
this
beer
has
just
a
bit
of
oatmeal
character
to
it
that
adds
a
touch
of
oily
rich
body
to
the
palate
the
beauty
of
this
beer
is
that
it
combines
the
rich
roast
malt
character
of
a
beer
far
beyond
this
alcohol
content
yet
still
retains
a
balance
that
does
not
allow
this
ample
roast
character
to
overwhelm
the
this
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
d
at
just
5
this
one
is
the
quintessentially
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
thick
rich
flavors
yet
low
abv
im
thankful
there
are
more
of
these
in
the
cellar
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
certainly
one
ill
be
looking
forward
to
having
again
d
im
not
crazy
about
the
texture
but
otherwise
this
is
an
outstanding
oatmeal
stout
poured
a
motor
oil
black
with
a
wispy
chococoloured
mocha
head
that
settled
quickly
into
a
thin
lacy
partial
film
lots
to
coat
the
side
of
the
glass
i
thought
i
detected
a
subtle
understated
carbonation
the
aroma
was
similarly
understated
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
hicory
taste
was
superb
very
full
in
the
mouth
with
generous
nutty
espresso
overtones
a
drawnout
lingering
finsh
with
ample
bitter
edge
and
just
a
hint
of
nut
continuing
a
perfect
world
would
include
a
lot
of
this
offering
high
marks
from
this
reviewer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
not
the
best
representation
of
style
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
honey
porter
than
an
oatmeal
stout
but
either
way
i
wasnt
very
impressed
there
are
many
other
stouts
or
porters
that
i
would
choose
over
this
beer
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
excellent
stout
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
it
was
available
here
very
tasty
and
session
worthy
wow
impressive
i
tried
this
masterpiece
er
beer
on
july
27
2007
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
it
came
to
me
in
a
glass
on
draught
and
appeared
to
be
chocolate
milk
with
a
thick
head
the
beer
was
dark
brown
with
a
medium
brown
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
malt
chocolate
and
fruits
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
and
not
as
thick
as
i
was
expecting
nor
was
there
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
the
flavour
was
full
of
malt
chocolate
and
plums
overall
this
was
a
truly
great
experience
and
completely
surprised
me
that
a
stout
could
provide
this
pours
an
opaque
oily
black
with
a
huge
three
finger
light
brown
colored
head
that
takes
a
while
to
die
down
to
a
frothy
layer
stickiness
is
insanely
good
just
how
i
lke
it
smell
is
a
heavy
sweet
milk
chocolate
with
flakey
oats
mxed
in
with
espresso
very
powerful
scent
lovin
it
taste
even
better
than
i
had
expected
taste
starts
off
with
a
toasted
nutty
malt
character
which
is
followed
by
the
molasses
and
sweet
oat
flavors
this
one
finishes
with
sweet
espresso
notes
that
last
forever
great
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
suprsingly
light
for
this
style
with
mild
carbonation
drinkablity
is
amazing
because
its
such
a
good
brew
this
by
far
meets
and
exceeds
the
hype
all
breweries
should
strive
to
reach
the
near
perfection
of
this
brew
when
it
comes
to
oatmeal
stouts
so
glad
i
have
five
more
drinkabilitynotes
a
pleasant

example
of
the
style
does
not
disappoint

you
can
get
brown
head
with
good

and
great

smells
of
robust
coffee
and
roasted

this
beer
not
your
average
oatmeal
stout
the
bitterness
lasts
awhile
along
with
the
roasted

character
extremely
drinkable
and
a
real
treat
all
year
round
aquired
this
beer
in
a
trade
with
plucier
served
slightly
chilled
in
an
oversized
snifter
from
a
341ml
brown
bottle
beer
looked
a
deep
brown
out
of
the
bottle
but
instantly
transformed
into
an
oily
black
in
the
glass
about
two
fingers
of
mocha
brown
head
formed
and
quickly
settled
into
a
thick
glob
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
left
a
reasonable
amount
lace
behind
a
nice
smooth
brown
sugar
aroma
rose
from
the
glass
followed
by
toffee
a
slight
hop
presence
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
also
a
little
bit
of
a
smokey
burnt
coffee
aroma
was
noticed
wasnt
as
impressed
with
the
taste
as
i
was
with
the
smell
bitter
burnt
coffee
an
almost
bitter
chocolate
flavor
some
smokey
notes
didnt
really
notice
any
hops
like
i
did
in
the
nose
moderately
carbonated
had
a
thin
somewhat
chalky
feeling
in
the
mouth
that
lackeed
a
lot
of
body
drinkability
was
decent
i
would
probably
drink
this
beer
again
wasnt
expecting
the
twist
off
cap
i
poured
it
a
little
slow
i
guess
but
there
was
a
small
head
that
mostly
went
away
after
a
minute
or
so
smells
like
coffee
roasted
malt
maybe
even
a
hint
of
chocolate
could
be
a
little
oatmeal
in
there
too
hah
it
does
have
that
oatmeal
stout
smell
sounds
fairly
obvious
though
taste
is
largely
a
smokyroasted
malt
flavor
a
bit
of
coffee
too
tastes
pretty
much
just
like
it
smells
which
is
fine
with
me
cause
it
smells
great
medium
to
heavy
body
its
a
shame
they
dont
sell
this
stuff
down
here
lacing
is
pretty
minimal
tiny
layer
of
head
seems
to
be
in
for
the
long
haul
has
a
little
bitterness
too
it
as
well
maybe
a
some
of
the
hops
kicking
in
there
to
balance
out
the
rest
of
it
but
not
too
much
of
a
hop
flavor
really
lovely
black
beer
with
full
creamy
brown
head
fully
creamy
on
the
palate
soft
and
very
very
drinkable
aroma
of
mildly
roasted
malt
taste
is
delicious
balanced
roasted
coffee
notes
and
smooth
finish
a
real
pleasure

done
id
love
to
get
my
mitts
on
some
more
taste
followed
the
smell
a
bit
jerky
up
front
but
didnt
stand
up
against
the
roast
which
is
good
coffee
and
chocolate
werent
very
powerful
the
sweetness
and
oats
took
over
but
again
powerful
isnt
appropriate
drank
rather
well
felt
a
bit
weak
and
thin
overall
a
solid
brew
i
was
surprised
by
how
throughly
enjoyable
complex
and
wellcrafted
this
beer
is
a
thick
semisweet
chocolate
taste
followed
by
dark
fruits
coffee
beans
and
of
course
oatmeal
to
add
substance
and
flavor
a
wonderfully
full
and
silky
smooth
mouth
feel
had
me
gaga
over
this
one
i
could
have
it
all
night
beautifully
done
this
was
my
favorite
beer
in
canada
d
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
or
i
would
be
getting
a
lot
more
of
this

and
there
is
a
definite
oatmeal
type
flavour
as
well
quite
bitter
but
it
leaves
an
amazing
burnt
aftertaste
carbonation
is
a
little
high
for
this
beer
a
little
less
would
be
nice
im
pretty
sure
anyone
could
down
a
6pack
of
these
on
a
st
patricks
day
for
sure
lowish
abv
and
great
flavour
means
this
is
an
incredible
beer
d
provided
you
enjoy
the
ample
bitterness
this
is
a
beer
that
should
always
be
on
hand
in
ones
beer
fridge
great
beer
from
old
old
notes
seeing
this
on
the
top
100
forced
me
to
get
out
the
old
notebook
and
play
some
catch
up
thanks
owed
to
autumnal
dave
for
giving
me
this
oil
like
appearance
black
and
thick
large
creamy
light
brown
head
dissipates
to
pretty
lace
very
clingy
smells
like
coffee
made
twangy
by
apricot
or
some
other
light
fruit
and
cocoa
with
that
well
know
oatmeal
bitterness
quite
an
ominous
feel
and
heaviness
very
dark
and
very
bitter
lots
of
raosted
malt
followed
by
oily
hops
in
the
finish
oatmeal
bitterness
lingers
this
is
for
sipping
not
downing
despite
the
low
abv
very
good
final
statement
lack
of
excitement
here
is
based
on
the
fact
ive
drank
many
of
these
and
am
finally
reviewing
it
it
is
quite
an
amazing
stout
one
of
the
best
every
beer
enthusiast
has
heard
of
this
one
and
rightfully
so
its
a
mainstay
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favourites
it
tastes
great
and
i
can
usually
find
it
in
stores
in
my
area
notes
special
thanks
to
biegaman
for
the
sample
i
dont
know
how
im
going
to
get
more
of
these
but
i
hear
canada
is
nice
in
the
summer
like
the
the
other
st
ambroise
offerings
i
really
liked
the
way
it
dried
out
my
mouth
like
a
tannic
wine
beautiful
black
body
felt
as
good
going
down
as
it
looked
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
ever
had
that
pour
was
definitely
better
than
bottled
sammy
smith
which
i
love
i
brought
a
sixpack
back
to
the
states
and
though
i
didnt
love
it
from
the
bottle
quite
as
much
as
i
did
that
day
at
the
brewery
its
damn
good
next
and
last
the
st
ambroise
a
labricot
d
smooth
and
enjoyable
a
great
beer
to
be
drinking
in
ottawa
on
a
cold
december
day
thanks
to
northyorksammy
for
the
trade
the
name
reminds
me
of
the
catholic
church
i
used
to
go
to
when
i
was
growing
up
if
they
would
have
served
this
stuff
instead
of
communion
wine
maybe
id
still
be
going
to
mass
it
pours
a
lovely
opaque
black
with
deep
brown
hints
and
a
nice
tan
head
the
nose
is
astounding
warm
smoky
malts
mingle
with
sweet
buttered
gingerbread
and
cafe
au
lait
its
really
complex
and
wonderful
it
sounds
odd
but
you
could
really
just
sniff
this
beer
all
night
if
i
could
give
it
a
5
5
on
smell
i
would
the
taste
is
pleasant
smoky
malts
with
some
almond
sweetness
strong
but
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
great
very
creamy
and
full
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
cant
say
enough
good
stuff
about
it
i
think
this
beer
reinstalled
my
faith
in
oatmeal
stouts
i
dont
know
why
ive
been
so
suspicious
of
them
for
so
long
maybe
because
i
brewed
one
and
it
tasted
like
armpits
could
be
this
one
poured
super
black
with
a
rushing
torrent
of
a
brown
head
smelled
roasty
nutty
malty
and
had
some
caramel
notes
in
there
too
taste
was
super
duper
good
smokey
malt
very
smooth
burnt
chocolate
taste
almost
creamy
approaching
milkshakeness
just
all
around
good
a
total
winner
had
this
one
on
tap
at
rebels
rock
irish
pub
in
hamilton
ontario
poured
a
black
body
withg
a
trhick
and
frothy
caramel
coloured
head
sweet
aromas
of
mild
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
like
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
dry
malts
full
bodied
though
for
the
most
part
heavy
lacing
on
the
glass
as
well
this
could
have
been
a
5
0
had
it
not
been
for
the
somewhat
watery
finish
a
great
canadian
product
in
any
event
d
very
light
compared
to
other
stouts
ive
had
a
really
great
stout
and
i
will
definately
finish
off
the
6pack
i
bought
absolutely
caseworthy
drinkability
an
all
day
long
stout
one
of
the
best
ones
around
imo
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
at
lcbo
near
the
toronto
airport
last
month
for
can10
on
sale
cheaper
than
the
pale
ale
a
slightly
vigorous
pour
into
my
nonic
yields
a
great
pillowy
and
creamy
light
mocha
head
with
a
brief
cascading
effect
on
top
of
a
deeply
black
chocolate
body
with
slight
mahogany
highlights
near
the
bottom
of
the

tremendous
lacing
as
well
the
superb
nose
reveals
scents
of
creamed
coffee
darkly
roasted
grains
vanilla
and
a
slight
milkchocolate
aroma
probably
the
bestsmelling
oatmeal
stout
ive
yet
come
across
the
taste
begins
with
a
vanilla
creaminess
but
far
from
overtly
vanillaflavored
and
moves
on
to
a
blackroasted
malt
grainy
flavor
from
there
it
rounds
out
into
a
dark
coffee
ground
earthiness
with
roasted
grain
flavors
weaving
back
in
for
a
spell
then
finishes
with
a
dry
slightly
acidic

nary
a
day
goes
by
without
me
trying
to
find
a
good
excuse
for
heading
across
the
river
to
see
if
the
beer
store
in
ft
erie
has
this
easily
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
in
north
america
if
not
the
world
drinkability
i
still
drink
least
a
six
pack
a
week
d
very
very
tasty
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
regularly
slightly
filling
beer
but
lower
alcohol
could
make
this
one
easy
to
drink
pours
a
very
opaque
black
some
red
in
the
edges
thick
tan
head
forms
lots
of
lace
great
retention
smell
is
sweet
some
cherries
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
up
front
roasty
chocolate
middle
roasted
bitter
finish
with
lots
of
coffee
and
a
little
anise
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
smooth
and
creamy
satisfying
oatmeal
stout
by
far
the
best
in
canada
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
a
nice
dark
looking
stout
from
our
friends
to
the
north
this
looks
and
pours
like
a
real
nice
stout
the
nose
is
somewhat
strong
almosty
scotch
like
with
its
tar
smoke
and
leather
the
taste
continues
on
this
theme
but
is
accompanied
by
some
malty
sweetness
overall
it
is
fairly
balanced
although
the
smokiness
plays
the
bitter
role
with
a
total
lack
of
hops
to
balance
the
malt
d
surprisingly
light
and
easy
to
drink
as
long
as
you
like
bitterness
and
strong
flavour
pours
absolutely
pitch
black
with
not
so
much
as
a
glimmer
of
light
around
the
edges
the
head
is
a
deep
tan
and
builds
to
about
two
fingers
before
settling
in
and
lasting
fluffy
and
thick
for
as
long
as
theres
still
beer
in
my
glass
leaving
thick
sheets
of
lacing
the
whole
way
down
smell
is
roasted
coffee
rich
and
pungent
with
an
underlying
sweetness
coming
together
with
a
mild
earthy
note
to
promise
a
rich
and
complex
brew
taste
is
big
and
bold
with
more
of
the
coffee
coming
to
the
fore
and
a
touch
of
hops
accompanying
the
chocolate
hints
in
the
finish
sweet
fruits
make
an
appearance
as
well
cherry
and
plum
notes
lingering
on
the
palate
for
ages
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
superb
truly
stellar
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
a
nice
surprise
the
deepest
brownblack
color
a
head
that
foams
up
brownishgrey
a
little
purple
at
the
edges
smells
of
espresso
raisins
toasty
malt
a
little
earthy
taste
starts
bitter
piney
hop
slant
quickly
fades
to
decent
roasted
malt
a
little
cocoa
to
a
lasting
bitter
finish
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
for
a
medium
bodied
brew
very
tasty
not
timid
and
not
bad
in
multiples
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
velvety
slightly
heavy
but
not
weighing
easily
reaches
into
imperial
stout
territory
without
the
alcohol
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
great
divide
yeti
with
half
the
abv
and
half
the
heat
wow
i
could
session
this
one
this
makes
a
nice
sipper
as
there
is
significant
depth
to
the
dark
character

di
have
had
many
oatmeal
stouts
and
not
very
many
are
good
this
one
is
great
there
is
good
complexity
to
the
malt
flavors
and
the
bitterness
of
the
malt
at
the
finish
balances
with
the
slight
sweetness
of
the
malt
at
the
beginning
the
oatmeal
qualities
really
compliment
the
beer
without
dominating
the
beer
making
it
too
funky
last
swigs
oatmeal
stouts
never
cease
to
amaze
they
can
take
on
a
myriad
of
flavors
an
this
one
is
no
exception
thanks
to
fellow
ba
jredner
for
the
bottle
a
delicious
meal
in
a
glass
absolutely
wonderful
this
is
a
great
beer
thanks
to
jredner
for
this
tasty
one
taste
is
of
roasted
coffee
at
first
followed
by
a
shy
note
of
hops
that
come
and
play
with
oatmeals
notes
and
maltish
caramel
flavours
very
pronounce
notes
of
roasted
and
burnt
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
as
a
solid
black
color
with
slight
ruby
nuances
in
the
light
head
is
dense
and
quite
dark
almost
coffee
brown
nose
is
coffee
too
along
with
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
the
earthy
grainy
notes
expected
from
an
oatmeal
stout
taste
is
deadon
with
big
time
coffee
chocolate
grains
and
sweet
malt
characteristics
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
cream
or
milk
stout
this
stout
is
dry
and
silky
meduimbodied
at
best
this
is
good
stuff
i
can
see
why
its
received
some
serious
accolades
try
it
if
you
can
get
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
sticks
to
your
ribs
a
bit
though
poured
a
very
deep
brown
virually
black
color
with
very
prominate
tannish
puffy
head
which
lasted
throughout
the
entire
glass
finallly
depositing
itself
on
the
bottom
beautiful
lacing
covered
the
glass
smell
is
rich
chocolate
coffee
figs
prunes
dates
roasted
malt
extremely
pleasureable
taste
is
as
goog
as
the
smell
with
bitter
chocolate
coffee
more
dark
fruits
a
nice
roastiness
blended
with
a
sharp
bitterness
finish
starts
malty
and
ends
dry
and
bitter
ver
drinkable
and
with
the
modest
alcohol
content
more
than
one
can
easily
be
enjoyed
at
a
sitting
another
nice
beer
from
this
brewery
aroma
is
charred
malt
coffee
chooclate
perfumey
notes
i
assocaite
with
baltic
porters
and
dark
fruits
lots
of
different
aroma
here
but
not
super
intense
body
is
deep
black
with
a
creamy
two
finger
thick
tan
head
fore
is
lightly
smoky
with
ample
coffee
notes
but
not
a
lot
of
chocolate
flavor
middle
is
nicely
smoothed
out
oatmeal
influence
i
assume
and
the
finish
is
dark
bitter
roasted
esspresso
flavors
im
a
little
underwhelmed
i
didnt
pick
up
a
huge
flavor
range
though
the
coffee
bitterness
is
fairly
intense
and
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
quite
nice
this
was
my
first
taste
of
oatmeal
stout
but
im
not
so
sure
this
is
the
best
example
there
wasnt
as
much
sweetness
as
i
expected
it
isnt
bad
though
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
one
if
it
was
offered
to
me
not
a
bad
beer
and
id
have
it
again
i
just
dont
think
it
completely
fit
the
oatmeal
label
this
is
a
favourite
of
mine
during
the
cold
long
months
of
winter
here
in
canada
in
the
ottawa
area
it
can
be
found
on
tap
and
in
the
beer
store
and
lcbo
in
quebec
it
can
be
found
in
almost
any
depanneur
corner
store
this
distinguished
stout
is
among
the
top
of
my
favorite
beers
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
the
mouthfeel
is
downright
exceptional
the
level
of
carbonation
is
just
about
perfect
and
the
oatmeal
contributes
to
a
silky
smooth
body
that
is
an
absolute
treat
to
drink
drinkability
is
good
perhaps
the
bitter
finish
might
slow
down
less
experienced
beer
lovers
but
its
otherwise
hard
to
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
it
is
an
outstanding
brew
that
has
encouraged
me
to
seek
out
more
oatmeal
stouts
in
the
future
a
cant
miss
thank
you
to
goldorak
for
supplying
this
one
thanks
to
nysammy
for
the
canadian
samples
drinkability
notes

the
burnt
bitter
flavor
makes
me
drink
this
at
a
slowish
pace
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
i
personally
prefer
my
oatmeal
stouts
more
to
the
sweet
side
this
is
like
a
combination
of
an
oatmeal
and
a
dry
stout
still
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
once
again
proof
that
canada
has
some
terrific
offerings
very
glad
this
beer
is
easy
to
come
by
in
my
area
and
i
recommend
it
to
any
stout
lovers
out
there
the
taste
is
strong
real
strong
its
surprising
that
its
only
5
alcohol
because
it
really
tastes
like
more
there
is
definitely
a
sweetness
to
the
beer
that
really
gives
way
to
the
hoppy
bitterness
its
smooth
as
cream
with
the
addition
of
the
oats
and
thick
this
one
really
does
drink
like
a
meal
and
i
cant
say
that
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
of
them
rather
this
is
one
to
be
slowly
enjoyed
with
good
company
and
something
sweet
to
nibble
on
solid
stout
santé
this
beer
is
much
better
on
tap
with
the
frothy
dispensor
i
found
this
beer
to
be
world
class
and
recommend
it
to
all
my
fellow
bas
since
this
can
be
found
at
my
local
beer
and
liquor
stores
i
will
most
definatly
buy
this
again
jet
black
in
colour
with
a
beige
head
powerful
aromas
of
roasted
malts
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
the
aromatic
qualities
are
replicated
to
perfection
in
the
mouth
with
some
subtle
additions
of
hops
a
slightly
leafy
bitterness
which
is
different
than
the
roasty
bitterness
of
the
malt
and
a
slightly
sweet
oaty
note
the
mouthfeel
is
huge
and
very
smooth
i
used
to
drink
this
stuff
all
the
time
in
my
early
university
years
but
the
mlcc
no
longer
carries
it
i
was
surprised
and
overjoyed
to
find
that
the
lcbo
in
kenora
carries
it
so
at
least
i
can
still
get
it
in
the
summer
when
i
go
to
the
lake
and
stock
up
for
the
winter
sturdy
opaque
black

direct
sunlight
could
barely
pass
chocolate
rings
of
lace
progress
with
each
sip
a
prune
and
raisin
filled
nose
with
slight
suggestions
of
tree
nuts
creamy
creamy
creamy
in
both
mouthfeel
and
flavor

this
is
possibly
the
first
stout
ive
ever
experienced
with
slight
butteriness
yet
the
whole
package
remained
amazingly
tasty
and
drinkable
even
with
off
tones
of
diactyl
lingering
prefinish
is
gorgeously
chocolately
and
coffeefilled
tasty
stout
i
would
like
to
thank
time
for
giving
me
this
beer
time
will
be
importing
this
beer
into
japan
from
about
august
2005
lets
give
him
our
support
drinkability
its
hard
drinking
a
lot
of
these
not
because
of
the
flavour
but
because
they
fill
you
up
like
a
meal
but
i
always
find
myself
coming
back
to
it
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
this
strikes
me
as
a
younger
brother
to
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
although
it
has
admittedly
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
one
of
those
with
less
alcohol
and
less
bite
but
most
of
the
goodness
still
there
great
drinkability
an
exceptionnal
product
it
is
a
very
subtile
and
tasty
beer
each
time
it
caresses
your
lips
and
your
mouth
you
discover
new
aspects
i
will
drink
it
again
for
sure
very
refreshing
but
slightly
watered
down
to
my
taste
it
seems
lacking
in
intensity
finally
good
stout
this
is
going
down
so
smooth
and
easy
im
glad
i
have
five
more
in
the
fridge
pouring
from
the
familiar
mcauslan
griffonlabelled
bottle
the
oatmeal
stout
is
indeed
very
darkly
blacki
find
almost
no
hint
of
red
or
brownthe
bottle
calls
it
intensely
dark
the
head
can
be
quite
large
if
you
pour
it
that
way
poured
slowly
and
evenly
i
got
4
to
5
cm
of
brownsugar
coloured
head
which
depending
upon
the
glass
is
quite
consistent
but
this
time
it
went
down
to
a
thin
layer
the
dark
foam
is
probably
some
of
the
darkest
i
have
seen
on
a
stout
the
deep
ebony
of
the
liquid
itself
contributes
to
an
extremely
solid
looking
beer
holding
the
glass
to
light
or
even
to
the
computer
screen
shows
only
impenetrable
black
lacing
is
thick
and
viscous
even
on
my
slightly
damp
glass
even
whilst
pouring
this
masterpiece
it
exudes
its
rich
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
and
sweet
raisins
inhaling
closer
reveals
burnt
coffee
rye
bread
sugared
apples
cereal
cream
spices
and
black
licorice
the
roasted
character
of
the
malt
is
absolutely
exceptional
releasing
toasted
warm
bread
without
being
overly
dry
or
pungent
to
the
nose
make
certain
to
drink
this
beer
at
a
comfortable
room
temperature
to
capture
the
full
gamut
of
smells
later
i
smell
a
good
deal
of
fruitiness
even
faint
brown
sugar
or
mollasses
the
aroma
never
gets
boring
taste
is
quite
dry
all
the
way
through
the
palate
but
plays
some
sour
doughy
flavours
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
at
first
in
the
middle
is
where
most
of
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
asserts
itself
the
first
sip
left
a
substantial
finish
of
tobacco
in
my
mouth
but
subsequent
quaffs
left
a
more
balanced
rather
dry
hoppy
feel
buttery
bread
extremely
sweetened
coffee
raisins
grainy
malt
spice
and
bakers
chocolate
flavours
at
first
the
body
feels
light
in
the
mouth
but
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
middle
and
back
it
is
heavy
and
thick
on
the
tongue
creamy
carbonation
but
some
definite
astringency
from
the
burnt
malt
and
the
alcohol
but
the
mouthfeel
is
still
much
above
average
for
me
dry
stouts
such
as
this
are
not
terribly
drinkable
in
terms
of
amountthe
parched
feeling
left
in
the
mouth
drys
me
out
after
2
still
this
is
a
stout
i
drink
regularly
as
it
combines
all
the
best
elements
of
any
stout
i
have
tried
oatmeal
or
not
this
deserves
all
the
awards
and
praise
it
has
garnered
the
flavour
can
get
a
bit
overpowering
taking
away
just
a
touch
of
drinkability
but
on
the
other
hand
i
enjoy
each
swallow
an
excellent
beer
keeping
some
of
this
around
is
a
no
brainer
update
june
2014
i
see
this
has
now
been
released
in
473
ml
cans
iso
ive
considered
other
canadian
oatmeal
stouts
as
that
is
all
that
is
available
to
me
right
now
but
keep
coming
back
to
mcauslans
even
better
ontap
smoother
a
nice
chocolate
color
and
taste
thick
consistency
nice
bittersweet
chocolateexpresso
aftertaste
with
a
tad
of
sweetness
less
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
without
the
flaoties
from
the
oatmeal
just
the
right
stout
black
with
a
brownish
beige
head
that
is
creamy
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
nice
chocolate
smell
chocolate
taste
too
tastes
of
toasted
malts
with
chocolate
base
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
too
even
though
a
stout
is
not
what
comes
to
mind
for
me
when
choosing
a
session
beer
what
a
great
stout
considering
that
it
comes
in
six
pack
and
is
easily
available
in
bc
jet
black
with
a
very
brown
head
this
is
full
of
those
nice
chocolate
roasted
malts
flavours
balanced
and
big
this
beer
is
only
5
alcohol
though
it
tastes
like
a
stronger
brew
one
of
canadas
best
stouts
next
to
crannog
right
from
the
pour
i
knew
i
was
in
for
something
good
dark
brownblack
with
a
mediumdark
brown
head
that
laced
well
and
never
completely
went
away
smell
was
an
invited
roasted
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
taste
was
very
very
nice
and
good
burnt
toast
grains
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
that
isnt
overpowering
and
a
nice
dry
finish
makes
a
good
breakfastbunch
beer
which
sets
me
up
for
a
long
day
of
drinking
sampled
in
a
guinness
glass
from
a
330ml
bottle
discovered
on
a
trip
to
kenora
ontario
pours
dark
heavy
black
with
beigeish
head
the
nose
is
very
chocolaty
and
creamy
with
notes
of
sweet
roasted
cereals
good
head
retention
taste
of
a
warm
chewy
oatmeal
cookie
with
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
to
round
out
and
balance
the
flavours
a
reasonably
light
mouthfeel
looks
were
deceiving
towards
the
aftertaste
a
roasted
maltiness
arrives
late
in
the
party
but
makes
its
presence
felt
a
malthops
tug
of
war
ensues
slowly
negotiating
towards
eventual
equilibrium
leaving
lingering
faint
impressions
of
cereals
and
roasted
malt
a
warm
versatile
brew
that
would
be
equally
at
home
out
on
a
friday
night
at
the
pub
or
curling
up
beside
a
december
fire
heavy
on
taste
light
on
feel
a
very
nice
brew
aroma
is
surprisingly
mild
with
light
roasted
malt
and
espresso
scents
a
hit
of
grassy
hops
mixed
in
too
beer
exhibits
a
silky
texture
but
not
huge
body
that
i
expect
very
gentle
rolling
carbonation
and
mild
flavor
too
some
roasted
malt
and
some
cheerios
flavor
mixes
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
some
grassy
hops
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
is
tasty
and
smooth
but
not
as
robust
as
expected
one
of
my
top
3
favorite
stouts
it
makes
guinness
draft
taste
truly
inferior
i
felt
perhaps
this
bottle
version
had
more
coffee
notes
than
the
draught
also
there
was
a
slight
metallic
taste
due
to
the
cap
but
thats
to
be
expected
possibly
the
strongest
point
for
this
beer
is
the
robust
body
and
silky
smoothness
an
excellent
beer
all
around
what
a
beer
this
is
my
first
oatmeal
stout
and
i
am
now
very
interested
in
the
style
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
tasted
in
my
few
years
as
a
beer
advocate
the
colour
is
inkblack
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
the
beer
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
malt
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
appreciates
a
good
stout
it
may
not
be
the
best
stout
in
the
world
but
in
the
land
of
government
regulated
liquor
stores
this
is
a
gift
from
the
gods
comments

a
big
ba
thumbs
up
to
rastacouere
for
sending
me
this
canadian
east
coast
gem
makes
me
want
to
stand
up
and
speak
french
hot
damn
this
beer
is
even
better
than
i
thought
pours
a
jet
black
colour
with
a
tanned
light
head
about
a
finger
worth
lace
sticks
to
the
glass
like
lingerie
beautiful
aromas
of
coffee
oats
chocolate
barley
and
hops
wow
what
a
taste
sweet
barley
and
chocolate
mingle
with
the
coffee
and
hops
while
the
oats
give
a
unique
mild
flavour
tastes
great
hell
better
than
great
its
not
heavy
not
light
slightly
complex
but
simple
enough
to
simply
enjoy
exceptional
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
smoooth
with
a
mouthfeel
and
taste
this
great
drinkability
is
high
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
creamy
chocolate
scent
that
is
very
pleasant
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
creamy
dark
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
oatmeal
finish
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
chocolatey
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
it
is
a
fine
stout
with
awesome
aroma
and
good
stout
flavor
and
so
we
attempte
to
define
the
sublime
as
a
spiriitual
experience
something
of
the
highest
moral
or
ethical
expression
could
we
say
the
highest
quality
perhaps
without
a
question
in
my
limited
experience
this
is
truly
the
best
of
its
type
that
i
have
ever
had
a
wondeful
mystical
experience
made
even
more
speical
and
memorable
by
the
place

and
company

chill
magnificent
a
fine
specimen
of
the
style
im
not
much
of
a
coffee
fan
myself
but
that
characteristic
certainly
does
lend
itself
to
this
stout
and
enhances
it
many
thanks
to
northyorksammy
for
sending
this
one
my
way
notes
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
available
if
you
like
this
style
you
have
to
try
this
one
thanks
to
kbub6f
for
the
opportunity
cheers
all
in
all
a
great
bottled
canadian
stout
yummy
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
a
blast
the
color
reminds
me
of
rich
mohogany
and
the
smell
is
no
indicator
of
the
range
of
flavors
that
youll
soon
experience
the
first
sensation
is
a
light
carbonation
with
gentle
sweetness
the
next
fleeting
taste
is
almost
that
of
green
olives
but
only
for
a
second
finally
your
mouth
is
filled
with
a
deep
chocolatecoffee
flavor
that
almost
leaves
you
expecting
a
coffee
buzz
afterward
overall
i
find
it
creamy
satisfying
yet
hungry
for
more
if
guinness
and
chocolate
stout
had
a
child
st
ambroise
would
be
a
firstborn
to
make
any
papa
proud
bottle
opaque
black
brew
with
a
medium
head
that
dissapate
too
quickly
excellent
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
with
a
sweet
taste
good
roastiness
and
good
body
i
would
be
curious
to
try
this
one
on
tap
probably
the
best
product
from
the
mcauslan
brewery
simply
black
coloured
beautiful
it
smells
like
a
good
espresso
the
taste
is
indeed
sweet
burnt
caramel
and
chocolate
in
harmony
nice
bitterness
to
balance
it
all
round
texture
creamy
one
of
the
only
stouts
i
could
drink
more
than
3
in
a
row
of
and
to
top
it
all
off
it
reminds
you
of
drinking
a
coffee
by
leaving
the
same
nasty
aftertaste
but
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
fantastic
stout
that
could
almost
convince
me
that
stouts
are
the
best
almost
nice
itd
make
a
nice
dessert
now
this
is
a
stout
by
far
my
favorite
nitro
stout
and
2nd
only
to
samuel
smiths
in
the
stout
category
in
my
book
where
to
begin
this
beer
explodes
with
flavor
but
keeps
the
sweetness
in
check
pours
a
dark
charcoalblack
color
with
an
excellent
body
and
head
notes
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
espresso
are
evident
but
not
overbearing
perfectly
balanced
i
wish
we
could
get
this
stuff
in
the
states
midnight
black
color
medium
head
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
a
medium
bodied
sweet
stout
deeply
roasted
malts
big
dark
malt
flavors
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
wood
extremely
smooth
creamy
and
slightly
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
nice
sipping
beer
complex
yet
subtle
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
very
nice
beer
like
francisweizen
i
also
had
this
on
tap
at
cest
what
in
toronto
this
is
oh
so
good
a
velevety
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
the
aromas
were
very
complex
bursting
with
sweet
roasted
malt
and
some
nice
hops
as
well
tasting
this
was
so
much
different
than
say
a
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
it
just
was
so
much
smoother
and
creamier
less
bitter
also
i
have
not
had
this
in
the
bottle
but
it
cannot
be
as
good
as
this
nitro
tap
serving
simply
put
an
incredibly
full
bodied
well
balanced
oatmeal
stout
cheers
i
will
definetly
meet
this
brew
again
the
references
to
stout
on
the
label
and
the
standard
bottle
are
circumstantial
evidence
that
youre
pouring
beer
and
not
5w30
the
huge
brown
doughy
head
makes
you
wait
to
get
at
that
black
gold
a
rubber
spatula
comes
in
handy
to
scrape
the
huge
clumps
of
lacing
off
the
sides
of
the
bowl
and
fold
them
back
in
sweet
roasty
toffee
milky
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
smoke
come
off
in
the
nose
burnt
toffee
in
the
front
gives
way
to
a
sweetish
full
middle
where
hints
of
fruit
give
it
a
tangy
zing
or
possibly
a
zingy
tang
some
bitter
chocolate
too
the
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
with
charcoal
notes
this
is
still
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
its
really
quite
dry
with
a
very
bitter
finish
i
wouldnt
change
a
single
thing
about
this
except
maybe
the
bottle
size
makes
me
want
to
get
back
in
my
car
and
go
get
some
more
originally
sampled
on
14
september
2002
beautiful
chocolate
oatmeal
nose
black
w
a
large
tan
head
this
is
an
incredibly
dry
finishing
beer
very
nice
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
the
classic
example
of
what
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
seek
it
out
f
pours
black
with
a
brown
rocky
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
one
quarter
of
its
original
size
but
sticks
around
until
the
last
few
sips
are
gulped
down
an
appetizing
smoky
bouquet
is
followed
by
complex
flavors
from
roast
malt
and
oatmeal
and
finished
with
a
crisp
dryness
this
stout
has
a
soft
mouth
feel
and
would
go
well
with
shellfish
a
fine
example
of
oatmeal
stout
its
a
shame
that
st
ambroise
does
not
appear
to
be
available
in
the
united
states
pours
perfectly
opaque
black
with
a
head
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
the
aroma
is
big
and
bold
with
a
slight
lactic
quality
and
a
suggestion
of
tartness
the
flavor
is
nicely
roasty
but
balanced
by
the
softer
dark
malts
comes
across
like
chocolate
charcoal
despite
a
slight
harshness
the
overall
effect
is
a
very
soft
beer
oily
on
the
tongue
my
5th
reviewthanks
what
a
mouth
watering
site
it
is
to
see
a
world
class
stout
sitting
in
its
chalice
the
head
all
chocolate
brown
and
creamy
majestically
perched
on
that
ebony
fluid
of
life
mine
anyway
with
the
prospect
of
fine
sheets
of
lace
to
come
as
the
head
slowly
ebbs
away
the
aroma
of
toasted
oats
sweet
chocolate
coffee
oh
yes
im
drooling
at
the
thought
of
the
first
taste
the
start
ambrosial
liquid
pleasure
the
top
creamy
rich
and
voluptuous
and
the
finish
perfect
in
its
carbonation
angelically
hopped
bittersweet
chocolate
dry
what
a
treat
eye
candy
for
sure
and
a
great
treat
for
the
rest
of
your
sense
also
a
wonderfully
dark
almost
black
pour
with
a
generous
bronze
head
exceptionally
smooth
going
down
with
great
hints
of
roasted
oates
dark
chocolate
and
even
a
touch
of
coffee
this
beer
easily
ranks
as
one
of
the
worlds
top
oatmeal
stouts
its
my
personal
favorite
notes
quite
robust
and
a
little
boisterous
to
the
palate
hmmm
tastes
like
an
oatmeal
stout
from
the
peek
of
the
microbrewery
revolution
or
at
least
a
kick
ass
homebrew
got
to
love
this
stuff
not
many
people
have
the
balls
to
brew
like
this
these
days
great
stuff
guys
for
a
nonnitro
i
think
beer
this
has
a
heck
of
a
nice
creamy
head
came
with
the
perfect
amount
of
it
too
the
taste
is
excellent
smooth
a
little
bitter
some
roasted
flavours
this
went
down
very
well
ill
certainly
be
back
to
that
bar
for
more
of
this
thanks
to
a
trade
with
a
canadian
beer
lover
for
this
one
outstanding
stout
although
i
still
like
sam
smiths
a
little
more
my
only
negative
comment
about
this
one
is
that
the
alcohol
flavor
was
not
hidden
as
well
as
it
could
have
been
or
do
we
call
that
bitterness
roasted
aroma
and
nice
coffee
flavoring
almost
black
with
great
lacing
i
am
going
to
try
to
hunt
this
one

sometime
wow
it
was
like
drinking
soy

roasted
coffee
hintsnonegood
color
no
head
at
allit
was
sour
pungent
just
horrible
age
obviosly
got
to
this
beer
iam
not
sure
how
it
found
its
way
down
here
in
nc
but
iam
sure
it
had
been
siting
there
for
awhilei
will
retry
at
some
point
and
rereview
opaque
and
black
in
color
with
good
tan
head
mediumfull
body
with
smooth
textured
mouthfeel
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
flavors
a
nice
brew
on
nitro
which
may
have
a
slight
influence
the
beer
itself
tastes
creamy
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
a
mellowed
dark
chocolate
best
part
is
the
heh
mouthfeel
o
a
bit
disappointing
but
only
because
this
brewery
has
so
many
great
beers
taste
lots
of
chocolate
slight
hop
bitterness
the
beer
almost
tasted
like
a
mocha
with
its
soft
coffee
finish
the
beer
is
dark
brown
nearing
black
with
a
thin
beige
collar
aromas
of
chocolate
dark
malt
grains
bread
some
dark
fruit
and
raisin
notes
in
the
flavor
really
smooth
on
the
palate
due
to
the
serving
medium
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
good
stuff
draft
at
winberies
dark

with
minimal

thick

oatmealchocolateraisin
mouthfeel
one
of
the
first
where
the
oatmeal
plays
a
strong
starring
role
against
the
other
flavors
here
creamy
smooth
and
delicious
need
to
find
more
of
this
solid
unsweetened
cocoa
powder
forward
and
nice
oat
feel
roasty
grains
with
some
fruit
nitro
doesnt
really
enhance
it
all
that
much
for
me
o
so
its
not
a
rich
or
robust
stout
but
its
definitely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
wouldnt
grab
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
kick
in
the
mouth
a
one
dimensional
beer
not
much
complexity
alot
of
lighter
spectrum
stout
character
and
flavors
but
really
this
beer
that
flaunts
body
and
feel
over
taste
very
easy
to
drink
the
oatmeal
does
its
job
to
create
that
creamy
texture
i
had
this
on
tap
at
ballast
point
it
pours
a
very
dark
cola
brown
and
opaque
the
head
is
a
light
taupe
color
the
head
fades
to
a
thin
cap
quickly
coffee
nose
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
to
the
finish
standard
stout
but
miles
better
than
guinness
overall
a
good
effort
by
ballast
on
their
oatmeal
stout
but
it
ultimately
falls
a
bit
short
boring
simple
flavor
profile
redeemed
by
its
creamy
nitroed
mouthfeel
moderately
thin
bodied
smooth
carbonation
creamy
nitro
feel
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
but
there
just
wasnt
much
to
it
at
all
the
oatmeal
was
pretty
much
undetectable
in
flavor
or
mouthfeel
id
like
to
try
this
again
sans
nitro
and
see
how
it
fares
overall
one
of
the
best
session
stouts
i
have
ever
had
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
dense
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
chunks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oats
cocoa
and
coffee
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
due
to
the
nitro
treatment
overall
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
solid
on
nitro
at
capones
black
friday
event
this
was
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
and
retention
on
this
beer
was
great
the
smell
and
taste
reminded
me
a
lot
of
guinness
draught
which
i
was
really
enjoying
because
for
me
its
so
easy
to
drink
there
was
just
a
little
extra
coffee
on
the
nose
here
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
ultra
smooth
and
went
down
very
quickly
overall
its
a
good
drinkable
brew
and
i
would
drink
it
again
in
the
future
o
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
i
didnt
find
it
anything
that
stood
out
over
the
others
available
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
enjoy
ballast
point
o
has
potential
but
id
prefer
to
see
it
on
draft
rather
than
on
nitro
overall
a
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
well
balanced
and
drinkable
recommended
d
very
good
oatmeal
stout
that
reminded
me
of
a
milk
stout
but
with
some
hoppy
balls
behind
it
skol
sampled
this
one
on
the
nitro
tap
at
the
ballast
point
breweryhome
brew
mart
in
san
diego
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
tight
creamy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
fresh
coffee
medium
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
i
think
this
is
a
good
drinking
stout
but
it
could
use
something
a
little
extra
for
me
raising
the
abvs
a
bit
would
actually
help
bring
something
a
little
more
robust
in
my
opinion
definitely
better
experienced
off
of
the
nitro
or
even
cask
perhaps
drink
1st

liked

liked

have
this
one

shaker
poured
black
with
a
red
hue
around
the
edges
with
a
minimal
light
tan

maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
very
subtle
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
and
subtle
sweet
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
it
was
very
light
and
easy
drinking
not
a
whole
lot
of
robust
anything
going
on
in
this
one
but
the
flavors
were
quite
complex
for
a
nitrotap
brew
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
suggest
you
do
as
well
at
least
once
a
delicious
velvety
easy
to
drink

stout

this

really

makes
a

quaff
with
the
hint

o
the
beer
is

although
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of

not

them

this
is
a

to

d

a

oatmeal

not

in

served
in
a

dark

black
body
with
a
contrastingly
pearl
white
head
smell
had
a
great
scent
of
oats
and
coffee
flavor
was
very
impressive
with
lots
of
notes
of
chocolate
and
cappuccino
light
on
the
flavor
side
which
is
what
i
enjoy
in
an
oatmeal
stout
the
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
really
enhanced
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
it
was
one
of
the
more
silkier
beers
i
have
had
lately
never
would
have
guessed
over
6
abv
could
have
drank
these
all
night
a
world
class
example
of
the
style
ballast
point
has
been
really
consistent
with
quality
beers
this
one
continues
that
trend
on
tap
at
the
hulmeville
pours
opague
black
with
a
nice
inch
light
brown
creamy
heading
that
only
a
beer
on
nitro
can
give
kept
about
a
half
inch
head
until
the
last
gulp
nothing
to
fancy
with
this
beer
some
coffee
bean
aromas
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
malt
some
powdery
lactic
grittiness
left
in
the
mouth
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
earth
shattering
d
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
would
like
to
have
again
very
easy
to
drink
i
might
have
to
try
this
on
co2
or
cask
because
this
beer
just
doesnt
seem
very
flavorful
to
me
d
not
a
stout
person
its
a
mood
for
me
this
is
an
easy
drink
for
me
though
i
definitely
could
have
another
which
i
normally
wont
say
about
a
stout
it
went
well
with
what
i
was
eating
sweet
potato
fries
with
a
beer

d
easily
drinkable
all

but
lack
id
feel
might
get
boring
thoroughly
delicious
order
it
if
you
see
it
perhaps
ive
overrated
the
look
and
feel
if
you
consider
nitro
cheating
but
for
some
reason
the
artifice
really
worked
for
me

that

till

there
was
not
much
going
on
in
the
smell
department
the
verdict
not
bad
as
with
most
of
mendocinos
offerings
it
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
not

more

for

not
what
i
expected
most
oatmeal
stouts
ive
tried
are
very
smooth
on
the
creamy
side
this
taste
is
much
less
viscose
a

bitter
almost
acidic
not
bad
but
with
a
6
abv
the
cost
in
terms
of
my

consumption
allowance
out
weighs
the
enjoyment
factor
gnome

black

with
close
to
a
1finger

head
that
settles
down
to
around
the
sides
on
top
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet

in

well

the

the

that
that
theres
a

is

its

and
has
a
good

i
think
its
a
good
oatmeal
stout
definitely
worth
trying
o
its
not
an
awful
stout
but
comparatively
there
are
just
many
more
complex
and
more
enjoyable
examples
of
the
style
at
similar
price
points
pick
up
if
you
are
new
to
the
style
if
you
arent
this
will
be
a
disappointment
to
you
had
this
on
cask
at
the
local
pub
it
was
the
2nd
day
of
the
cask
had
a
nice
head
to
it
the
aroma
was
slight
caramel
and
oats
the
oatmeal
taste
was
fantastic
cask
is
the
best
way
to
enjoy
this
stout
it
really
brings
out
the
taste
had
this
on
bottle
once
and
thought
it
was
just
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
cask
makes
all
the
difference
o
the
taste
really
hits
hard
everything
else
about
this
beer
is
good
to
great
but
that
big
blast
of
odd
bitterness
is
really
hard
on
the
first
few
sips
a
great
oatmeal
stout
great
body
and
flavor
although
it
could
have
been
more
full
smell
is
slightly
lacking
but
may
just
be
from
bottle
would
love
to
try
this
on
draft
somewhere
or
in
a
growler
would
recommend
for
most
oatmeal
stout
lovers
i
would
say
this
is
a
must
try
we
are
huge
dark
beer
fans
and
this
is
our
favorite
every
day
stout
pours
beautifully
and
has
that
great
guinness
appearance
packed
with
flavour
never
disappoints
we
get

room

one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
i
love
that
it
is
located
locally
and
that
i
can
stop
in
for
samples
their
whole
line
seems
to
reasonably
priced
last
year
i
only
bought
a
six
pack
then
i
found
out
it
was
seasonal
this
year
i
already
have
a
case
and
i
am
headed
to
minogues
for
another
growler
of
it
yum
very
drinkable
beer
could
easily
drink
several
and
for
7
a
sixpack
you
cant
go
wrong
at
all
definatly
improved
my
overall
opinion
on
mendocino
brewing
company
the
welcome
addition
of
smoke
really
made
this
beer
for
me
highly
recommended
imho
o
this
is
just
a
great
all
around
oatmeal
o
solid
although
not
exceptional
offering
no
surprises
good
or
bad
the
aftertaste
is
easy
to
take
it
fades
to
a
little
bit
of
bitter
it
would
have
been
nice
to
see
this
same
brew
a
bit
more
over
the
top
imperial
as
is
it
is
a
good
value
and
not
an
insult
to
drink
oa
really
decent
oatmeal
stout
with
the
full
range
of
rich
flavors
that
you
want
from
the
style
it
seems
to
be
well
balanced
and
is
really
hitting
the
spot
during
this
chilly
spring
night
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
and
at
a
price
like
that
how
could
i
complain
it
pours
almost
black
but
in
reality
it
is
a
very
dark
brown
it
sports
a
mocha
head
with
moderate
retention
and
excellent
lacing
that
cascades
slowly
down
teh
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
carries
hints
of
smoke
and
dark
chocolate
lots
of
burnt
malt
detectable
the
taste
follows
suit
slight
smokiness
with
a
lot
of
grain
bitter
chocolate
in
teh
finish
with
a
slightly
sour
aspect
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
the
carbonation
follows
suit
nicely
very
nice
beer
hearty
yet
surprisingly
mellow
overall
a
good
and
quite
straightforward
stout
oats
add
a
creamy
feel
and
finish
but
the
light
carbonation
limits
the
love
here
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
the
world
but
mendocino
has
delivered
a
serviceable
indeed
quite
tasty
oatmeal
stout
id
definitely
have
this
again
the
flavor
is
more
true
to
formmore
burnt
bitter
malt
like
many
stouts
this
one
is
thin
perhaps
thinner
than
most
mild
finish
of
overroasted
malt
but
it
lingers
forever
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
i
have
a
couple
gripes
about
this
brew
the
first
being
the
mineral
quality
present
in
the
flavor
profile
was
not
that
enjoyable
mixed
with
a
hint
of
sulfite
the
other
gripe
i
have
is
in
the
body
of
this
brew
it
is
lacking
just
a
bit
and
seems
lighter
than
it
should
for
being
advertised
as
an
oatmeal
stout
i
would
have
liked
to
seen
a
bit
more
fuller
or
smoother
body
from
the
oats
otherwise
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
nose
on
this
brew
is
an
absolute
beast
i
would
get
it
again
just
to
smell
it
it
is
that
good
drinkability
solid
stuff
it
is
not
extraordinary
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
with
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
to
go
along
with
nice
flavors
and
aromas
well
balanced
glad
i
found
this
one
not
on
the
menu
when
i
peeked
into
the
fridge
behind
the
bar
overall
worth
picking
up

is
surprisingly
sweet

of
roasted

with

of

feel
is
on

side
with
a
gentle

crisp

good
solid
brew
o
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
average
oatmeal
stout
which
makes
it
enjoyable
but
a
slow
sipper
still
worth
trying
lets
not
forget
what
it
looks
like
i
cannot
really
judge
appearance
first
thing
but
halfway
down
a
huge
sheet
of
foamy
lacing
coats
the
glass
the
mocha
colored
head
chunky
and
foamy
has
dissipated
to
a
few
random
patches
with
a
bubbly
ring
around
the
glass
the
beer
itself
is
a
deep
dark
coffee
black
with
a
good
colabrown
hue
in
the
light
overall
a
promising
stout
but
it
falls
short
of
being
great
the
lack
of
hops
causes
this
beer
to
be
too
sweet
and
onedimensional
and
kills
any
chance
of
being
sessionable
probably
works
best
as
a
desert
beer
overall
quite
average
i
wasnt
too
impressed
overall
a
nice
stout
but
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
again
quite
quaffable
but
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
more
oatmeal
in
this
o
this
was
disappointing
i
generally
like
mendocino
but
this
one
just
wasnt
that
good
full
but
a
bit
too
lactic
sour
too
nice
and
dark
rich
color
pours
a
touch
flat
not
too
much
toastiness
but
a
nice
it
of
heavy
malts
nose
is
essentially
nonexistent
heavy
feel
that
just
oozes
off
the
palate
i
like
this
is
a
single
or
double
bottle
but
would
not
have
more
than
a
few
in
a
sitting
o
this
is
ok
its
a
pretty
simpletasting
beer
which
is
not
in
line
with
the
nose
this
is
a
bummer
man
thats
a
thats
a
bummer
an
alright
stout
thats
lacking
enough
classic
oatmeal
stout
characteristic
that
it
leaves
me
somewhat
sad
i
bought
a
sixer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
slight
caramel
colored
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
virtually
no
lacing
but
carbonation
lingers
to
outside
of
glass
strong
roasted
malt
and
caramel
scent
mouthful
is
sweet
with
some
carbonation
tastes
as
it
smells
strong
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
as
you
drink
one
of
the
sweeter
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
had
would
buy
again
poured
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
with
some
nice
initial
head
but
ended
soon
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
sweet
malty
scent
slight
roastiness
but
nothing
very
deep
and
dark
nice
flavors
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
a
nice
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
oats
but
nothing
huge
and
deep
went
down
quite
well
nice
and
creamy
not
the
best
ive
had
but
a
good
oatmeal
stout
o
the
ipswich
was
creamier
and
had
a
slight
edge
all
around
this
stout
had
an
interesting
molasses
flavor
though
still
i
think
ipswich
is
the
winner
decent
but
there
are
a
lot
better
to
choose
from
scored
a
6
pack
of
this
for
6
99
at
ledgerss
liquors
about
a
year
ago
drank
5
of
them
in
the
last
year
still
have
one
left
in
the
course
of
the
year
each
one
tasted
the
same
as
the
last
indicates
its
pretty
sturdy
sure
some
beers
can
taste
great
in
a
small
window
of
time
this
one
tastes
good
in
a
large
window
of
time
o
a
solid
drinkable
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
black
and
poured
a
nice
tan
head
unfortunately
the
head
went
away
pretty
fast
the
beer
had
a
fruity
smell
and
strong
coffee
smell
the
taste
was
a
strong
coffee
finish
with
the
oatmeal
balancing
out
the
taste
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
it
a
great
beer
i
will
buy
again
o
surprisingly
good
after
a
fairly
average
aroma
i
really
liked
the
chocolate
in
this
oatmeal
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
12
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oats
and
some
coffeecocoa
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oats
and
coffee
beans
there
is
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
that
is
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
mendocino
this
may
not
be
a
worldclass
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
tasty
and
is
easy
drinking
i
think
i
prefer
it
slightly
to
mendocinos
black
hawk
stout
mendocino
isnt
touted
for
creating
extraordinary
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
but
as
far
as
making
a
pleasant
flavorful
easy
drinking
smooth
stout
they
succeed
here
its
easy
to
drink
multiple
and
a
good
starting
point
for
someone
getting
into
the
darkies
roasted
malts
sweet
with
molasses
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
mellow
and
a
touch
hoppier
then
i
would
have
thought
very
nice
chocolate
notes
here
really
laid
down
quite
well
hints
of
molasses
again
and
a
decent
touch
of
vanilla
poking
its
head
up
the
finish
comes
through
with
a
light
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
o
oatmeal
stout
easily
recommended
for
those
who
like
more
than
a
hint
of
oatmeal
in
their
stouts
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
it
was
just
a
bit
too
fake
for
me
but
ill
take
the
smoothness
overall
enjoyable
everyone
try
it
if
you
like
stouts
had
a
bit
of
a
mini
tasting
today
with
some
mendocino
beers
this
first
one
pours
a
bleak
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
buttery
toffee
toasted
wheat
and
a
kiss
of
cocoa
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
touch
more
cocoa
and
buttery
biscuit
than
before
thankfully
the
roast
never
gets
overdone
as
happens
on
many
occasions
in
the
oatmeal
stout
world
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
creamy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
oatmeal
stout
one
that
doesnt
amaze
but
pleases
through
and
through
o
not
too
shabby
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
by
these
guys
before
but
theyre
starting
to
grab
my
attention
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
is
worth
a
try
bottle
black
small
light
brown
creamy
head
fair
lacing
and
good
retention
great
roasted
malt
aroma
the
usual
suspects
are
here
molasses
chocolate
coffee
toasty
caramel
mouth
is
mediumfull
with
creamy
carbonation
lightly
dry
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
some
coffee
bean
bitterness
and
a
mildly
hoppy
long
finish
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
easier
styles
to
get
right
a
lot
of
breweries
do
it
well
the
mendocino
is
a
solid
offering
very
tasty
and
true
to
form
do
this
fine
stout
is
similar
to
other
worthy
contributions
by
mendocino
in
that
it
is
a
respectable
example
of
the
style
without
any
pretense
of
reinvention
or
extremeness
it
is
approachable
and
satisfying
with
flavors
but
certainly
not
texture
that
compare
well
to
firestone
walkers
velvet
merlin
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
with
pronounced
alcohol
and
a
straight
laced
stout
profile
of
roast
chocolate
malt
and
supportive
hops
a
good
switch
up
from
that
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
from
time
to
time
pours
a
dark
motor
oil
color
with
a
tiny
brown
head
leaves
a
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
that
crawls
back
into
the
abyss
when
swished
around
the
beer
smells
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
the
slightest
hint
of
coffee
this
beer
tastes
of
stale
burnt
coffee
also
caught
notes
of
watered
down
chocolate
oats
unfortunately
this
beer
doesnt
taste
anywhere
near
how
it
smells
the
mouthful
is
pretty
thin
and
i
dont
catch
that
silky
smooth
finish
a
good
oatmeal
stout
contains
overall
this
beer
is
very
very
average
if
it
wasnt
for
the
the
decent
appearance
and
smell
which
are
both
pretty
good
this
beer
would
be
very
below
average
another
average
offering
from
mendocino
12
ounce
bottle
from
a
winter
beer

unceremonious
dumping

with
hints

slight

and
some
phenols

chocolate

i
guess
youd
call
that
chocolate
water
charred
coffee
beans
and
a
lingering
metal
note
that
recalls
sucking
on
a
penny
unfortunately
this
beer
derives
no
full
mouthfeel
or
silkiness
from
its
use
of
oats
and
so
my
tongue
derives
no
satisfaction
about
what
i
expected
from
mendocino
poured
dark
as
a
stout
should
a
small
hot
chocolate
frothy
head
formed
dissipating
quickly
earthy

chocolate
and
burnt

with
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
beans
roasted
maltsoats
hint
of
molasses
raisins
and
some
dark
brown
sugar
sweetness
medium
bodied
to
almost
dry
as
full
flavor
is
drowned
out
due
to
the
higher
than
expected
level
of
carbonation
nice
roasted
flavors
keep
it
interesting
mf
sweet
and
silky
though
with
maybe
just
a
little
off
flavoring
which
might
limit
drinkability
this
is
my
first
beer
from
mendocino
if
they
are
all
of
this
quality
however
ill
be
buying
a
lot
more
very
soon
a
wonderful
rich
chocolately
oatmeal
stout
with
a
truly
exceptional
fullbodied
feeling
aroma
love
it
yum
the
light
brown
head
is
a
nice
contrast
to
the
body
taste
is
pretty
good
but
leaves
me
feeling
a
little
empty
in
the
middle
it
has
a
wonderful
very
drinkable
light
finish
all
around
just
good
but
not
exceptional
other
than
smell
dreally
easy
drinking
but
this
beer
is
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
complexity
category
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
short
lived
head
of
tan
foam
the
retention
of
the
skim
however
was
good
and
it
laced
beautifully
the
aroma
was
dry
roasted
malt
leather
hints
of
meat
and
a
little
wet
soil
the
flavors
were
a
compilation
of
baking
chocolate
light
coffee
roasted
barley
more
leather
and
the
mouthfeel
was
rich
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
average
drinkability
at
first
i
found
this
drinkable
but
as
time
wore
on
i
slowed
up
a
bit
and
found
myself
want
a
bit
of
a
break
from
the
sharpness
of
the
dark
roast
bitterness
and
licorice
flavors
while
id
not
refuse
a
second
one
i
also
have
no
strong
desire
to
have
a
second
one
it
seems
a
reasonably
well
made
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
prefer
in
an
oatmeal
stout
next
time
ill
have
a
fat
dog
from
stoudts
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
color
with
a
tiny
tan
head
that
leaves
only
a
ring
in

roasted

a

but
ive
had
way
better
oatmeal
stouts
this
one
didnt
put
it
together
for
me
at
all
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
sipping
then
again
i
have
had
much
better
stouts
i
would
say
this
is
a
solid
aboveaverage
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
anything
that
will
surprise
you
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
its

and
really
only

not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
solid
experience
one
of
the
better
mendocino
brews
ive
had
in
recent
times
drinkability
not
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
the
roast
character
is
just
too
much
bordering
on
ashy
and
the
acidity
was
distracting
oatmeal
stouts
should
really
be
smooth
and
mellow
a
slam
dunk
in
the
easydrinking
category
this
just
doesnt
possess
those
qualities
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
flavor
with
slight
cocoa
elements
and
mild
roasted
flavor
with
a
mildly
sweet
taste
and
toffee
notes
with
a
nice
smooth
malt
and
pretty
light
bitterness
throughout
the
oatmeal
is
a
decent
stout
it
is
neither
bad
nor
good
basically
drinkable
for
the
style
but
not
stellar
m
d
typical
weight
but
lacking
any
requisite
maltiness
one
would
expect
from
the
style
not
much
else
that
isnt
already
here
lacks
the
chewiness
of
most
oatmeal
stouts
but
still
pretty
darn
good
im
glad
there
is
not
watery
flavor
like
some
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
hopefully
not
the
last
d
no
unbalanced
flavors
or
alcohol
stopping
me
from
getting
this
one
down
its
quite
drinkable
very
drinkable
beer
drank
4
of
these
new
years
eve
with
a
few
other
beers
no
problem
and
for
7
a
sixpack
you
cant
go
wrong
at
all
definatly
improved
my
overall
opinion
on
mendocino
brewing
company
the
welcome
addition
of
smoke
really
made
this
beer
for
me
highly
recommended
imho
overall
in
case
you
couldnt
tell
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
not
expecting
much
no
particular
reason
just
had
no
reason
to
expect
more
and
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
a
tasty
brew
definitely
very
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
it
i
would
like
this
more
if
it
finished
a
little
drier
with
a
roasted
malt
bitter
kick
a
nice
brew
if
not
a
mind
blower
taste
mouthfeel
grainy
and
burnt
up
front
moderately
acidic
with
a
smoky
undertone
not
particularly
rich
or
sweet
this
oatmeal
stout
is
heavy
on
blackened
malt
and
licorice
flavors
medium
in
body
though
quite
dry
this
could
use
more
sweetness
and
less
acrid
roasted
bitterness
drinkability
is
fair
but
the
heft
of
it
may
deter
people
from
imbibing
many
in
a
sitting
d
2
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
which
is
a
surprise
to
me
since
i
usually
love
stouts
i
think
i
will
be
giving
the
other
5
away
drinkability
easy
quaffing
stout
nice
roasted
flavors
keep
it
interesting
d
overall
good
mix
of
flavors
that
stay
well
balanced
and
a
smooth
beer
only
minor
complaint
is
it
could
be
a
bit
heavier
bodied
overall
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
dark
molasseslike
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
smells
of
oatmeal
and
roastedburnt
malt
over
undertones
of
chocolate
and
cherry
big
creamy
body
upfront
with
lots
of
black
patent
malt
bitter
chocolate
flavors
with
some
sweetness
mixed
in
the
finish
lingers
heavy
and
chalky
on
the
tongue
and
the
body
is
full
overall
i
would
rate
this
as
a
solid
if
not
outstanding
oatmeal
stout
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
and
the
best
mendocino
beer
i
have
tried
dm
really
smooth
drinking
brew
goes
down
nice
with
a
great
taste
that
makes
drinking
it
a
real
joy
quite
nice
overall
well
done
mendocino
the
tan
froth
leaves
spots
of
sticky
residue
on
the
sides
of
the
mug
and
you
take
a
bite
and
a
sip
and
smile
at
her
making
sure
her
teeth
stopped
chattering
and
her
ears
are
warm
under
her
thick
furry
hat
she
smiles
back
at
you
with
a
wonder
in
her
eyes
as
the
snow
begins
to
fall
ever
so
gently
and
her
breath
comes
out
misty
as
the
hot
espresso
evaporates
the
chocolate

abv
you
can
feel
the
more
you
drink
slight
burn
the
packaging
makes
this
look
like
a
novelty
beer
but
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
with
just
a
hint
of
blueberry
flavor
this
was
a
nice
brew
very
well
balanced
and
not
over
powering
the
best
part
of
the
beer
it
the
subtle
scent
of
blueberry
pancakes
when
you
hover
your
nose
over
it
you
can
barely
notice
when
you
drink
it
but
i
love
this
beer
o
this
one
makes
me
sad
the
idea
is
there
for
a
tasty
beverage
the
execution
falls
way
short
flavor
and
feel
just
arent
there
the
flavor
is
fine
the
texture
is
too
fizzy
though
a
friend
brought
over
a
six
pack
and
forgot
it
in
my
fridge
quite
a
pleasant
suprise
and
hey
its
tough
to
beat
free
beer
a
screwtop
really
i
just
felt
like
i
went
to
a
lot
of
unnecessary
work
and
to
take
out
my
frustration
i
nearly
inverted
the
bottle
until
i
realized
what
i
was
doing
at
base
it
is
a
stout
so
if
you
do
not
think
that
there
was
a
pseudocascade
going
on
you
are
deluding
yourself
it
settled
into
a
dense
finger
of
deeptan
head
that
acted
as
a
cap
above
the
beer
nose
was
very
fruity
very
blueberry
and
while
i
do
not
enjoy
them
quite
as
much
as
when
i
was
a
kid
blueberry
pie
remains
my
favorite
ah
sweet
blueberries
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
srm
44
allowing
zero
light
penetration
mouthfeel
was
full
kind
of
creamy
dense
with
carbonation
the
flavor
was
more
blueberry
than
stout
so
depending
on
your
preference
it
may
or
may
not
work
for
you
at
this
hour
it
was
working
for
me
since
i
am
positive
that
i
would
not
have
wanted
a
regular
stout
just
now
the
blueberry
flavor
was
very
evocative
of
summer
and
my
youth
and
nostalgic
drinking
is
one
of
my
favorite
things
to
do
finish
was
semidry
since
blueberries
do
not
tend
to
be
downright
sweet
anyway
and
when
coupled
with
a
nonsweet
stout
they
negated
it
being
sweet
very
nice
prost
lampertland
this
past
summer
i
came
upon
this
tasty
little
brew
at
my
local
package
store
being
a
lover
of
blueberry
flavored
beers
and
stout
i
gave
it
a
shot
i
was
surprised
that
the
blueberry
flavor
wasnt
sickly
sweet
and
was
wellbalanced
and
didnt
have
a
fake
flavor
to
it
the
sweetness
from
the
fruit
is
balanced
out
with
the
toast
of
the
stout
i
enjoyed
the
six
pack
and
went
back
to
buy
more
i
found
it
greatly
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
and
it
went
very
well
with
burgers
my
local
didnt
have
any
more
so
i
ordered
it
i
was
told
it
was
a
winter
seasonal
and
that
id
have
to
wait
a
few
months
to
get
more
i
happened
to
buy
the
last
one
leftover
from
the
last
batch
when
i
can
find
it
its
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
the
mouthfeel
follows
the
flavor
nicely
smooth
all
the
way
as
hoped
in
a
mostly
full
body
with
some
robustness
to
it
roast
is
most
noticeable
in
the
feel
actually
leading
into
a
roastydry
finish
it
could
be
a
little
fullerbodied
and
ever
so
slightly
smoother
for
the
style
i
just
happen
to
see
this
beer
on
the
shelve
for
the
1st
time
last
friday
after
work
so
i
thought
id
try
it
since
i
like
beer
with
flavor
it
looked
good
well
it
is
good
good
taste
smell
and
7
5
to
boot
with
no
nasty
after
after
taste
awesome
if
you
like
stout
beer
youll
enjoy
this
brew
very
much
it
all
sort
of
works
but
just
barely
i
intend
to
avoid
this
and
everything
from
this
brewery
going
forward
overall
a
drinkable
beery
flavored
stout
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
when
i
first
opened
the
bottle
it
was
like
opening
a
very
high
carbonated
soda
with
lots
of
noise
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
head
that
took
forever
to
dissipate
i
have
never
seen
this
before
the
aroma
was
pleasing
with
like
a
wheat
blueberry
pie
just
one
sip
and
your
mouth
filled
up
with
the
carbonation
damn
sam
didnt
taste
too
bad
but
the
excessive
carbonation
killed
it
overall
ended
up
poring
the
last
14
in
the
sink
i
tried
one
out
of
the
glass
one
out
of
the
bottle
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
me
i
gave
one
to
a
friend
which
turned
out
to
be
a
cruel
joke
but
extremely
funny
nearly
black
pour
with
ruby
hues
at
the
edges
insane
amounts
of
head
even
with
a
gentle
pour
some
sweetness
to
the
smell
but
blueberries
dont
stick
out
in
the
smell
or
the
taste
dont
get
any
of
the
silky
smoothness
i
would
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
a
standard
stout
with
not
much
else
going
on
drinkable
but
nothing
special
about
it
i
got
this
for
a
friend
when
he
was
in
southwest
wisconsin
i
traded
him
a
beer
since
i
never
tried
this
but
he
did
warn
me
about
the
huge
head
and
he
was
right
these
bottles
probably
went
through
a
second
fermentation
because
the
bottle
cap
had
a
lot
of
force
behind
it
and
even
with
a
slow
pour
there
was
5
times
more
head
than
beer
the
aroma
is
still
sweet
with
malts
and
blueberries
there
are
some
robust
flavors
mixed
with
sweet
blueberries
but
this
is
way
too
yeasty
and
it
almost
has
more
of
a
belgian
texture
oh
well
as
least
i
got
to
try
it
but
im
sure
that
this
is
not
the
way
it
is
suppose
to
taste
this
was
a
let
down
which
was
pretty
much
on
par
with
my
expectations
the
stout
flavors
were
just
lacking
nothing
really
off
about
it
and
its
pretty
drinkable
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
i
cant
figure
out
how
this
beer
mustered
an
80ish
i
feel
bamboozled
conclusion
non
beer
drinking
fruit
loving
stella
artois
praising
yuppies
have
sampled
this
concoction
and
deduced
its
dessert
sounding
name
equated
to
a
decadent
brew
steer
clear
stout
lovers
dont
make
the
same
mistake
as
i
did
anyone
want
to
buy
22
more
of
these
got
a
6
pack
of
bottles
first
one
not
quite
cold
so
it
went
down
the
drain
when
it
got
too
warm
for
my
taste
second
one
turned
out
to
be
a
little
better
but
still
searching
for
that
blueberry
taste
not
the
best
blueberry
ive
had
should
of
only
grabbed
one
and
let
it
chill
properly
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
to
make
sure
that
i
am
rating
it
accurately
the
smell
head
and
body
all
appear
to
be
something
that
you
will
love
however
the
finish
mouth
and
taste
lack
in
what
we
typically
would
like
in
an
outmeal
stout
i
have
found
that
drinking
it
at
a
higher
temperature
yields
a
much
better
result
albeit
that
is
only
after
two
trials
my
recommendation
serve
at
around
60
degrees
the
best
comes
out
in
it
at
that
range
i
purchased
this
in
a
mix
six
pack
i
picked
2
bottles
of
this
beer
regretting
that
now
fair
amount
of
white
looking
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
poured
a
whitecocoa
2
finger
head
which
had
a
rich
oatmeal
bluberryish
smell
a
ton
of
bubbles
and
fizz
poured
into
the
fat
tire
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
very
dark
in
color
when
it
took
the
swisharoo
test
not
much
lacing
the
beer
tasted
like
nothing
it
smelled
like
stout
yes
but
a
very
thin
style
stout
for
me
the
carbonation
was
out
of
freaking
control
berry
flavor
was
way
in
the
back
of
the
taste
for
me
and
the
front
was
a
faint
oatmeal
almost
ale
type
flavoroverall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
myself
but
maybe
someone
who
is
just
getting
into
fruit
style
stouts
might
enjoy
this
happy
hump
day
pours
a
rich
dark
chocolate
hue
with
smells
of
blueberry
pie
filling
complete
with
a
doughy
crust
taste
is
flat
burnt
and
unappealing
blueberry
is
hardly
noticeable
and
the
rich
roastiness
i
enjoy
in
a
stout
is
virtually
none
existent
mouthfeel
is
is
stinging
the
enjoy
by
21513
and
today
being
33
may
be
a
clue
drain
pour
i
didnt
know
mr
cody
was
a
brewer
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
midnight
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
blueberry
syrup
blackened
pretzel
and
oddly
enough
pancake
batter
the
taste
is
a
harsh
double
penetration
with
artificial
blueberry
on
one
side
and
a
starkly
bitter
helping
of
burnt
malts
on
the
other
you
have
to
be
into
this
sort
of
thing
and
i
guess
you
can
count
me
out
of
that
particular
fetish
group
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
fluid
feel
and
a
dry
finish
overall
this
stuff
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
though
things
were
placid
enough
in
the
smell
the
flavors
clash
painfully
and
its
unsure
whether
or
not
they
would
have
tasted
better
apart
from
each
other
anyway
add
to
that
an
oatmeal
stout
base
thats
just
way
too
thin
and
not
very
creamy
and
you
have
a
rather
subpar
beer
on
your
hands
son
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
blueberries
and
roasted
malt
medium
in
body
ultra
smooth
and
creamy
foundation
of
roasted
malt
blueberry
and
chocolate
overall
nice
session
beer
first
fruit
stout
that
i
have
sampled
it
was
well
balanced
o
if
you
drink
this
too
cold
it
has
very
little
flavor
also
even
though
it
is
listed
as
7
5
abv
it
feels
stronger
than
that
usually
im
not
a
fan
of
most
fruits
beers
that
arent
wildslambics
but
this
one
was
at
least
drinkable
and
decent
not
something
id
try
to
revisit
though
overall
drinkability
this
tastes
very
dreadful
everything
else
is
ok
though
my
take
a
very
good
blueberry
beer
similar
in
quality
to
sea
dogs
but
less
refreshing
longer
lasting
and
more
satisfying
pretty
good
for
a
fruit
beer
though
the
blueberry
flavor
itself
leaves
something
to
be
desired
o
smells
good
but
the
rest
is
forgettable
or
just
bad
overall
a
bit
too
much
blueberry
not
enough
stout
flavor
for
my
liking
its
drinkable
but
can
get
a
bit
too
sweet
with
so
much
blueberry
flavor
dominating
the
profile
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
alcohol
and
an
artificial
blueberry
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
and
a
fake
blueberry
flavor
that
is
slightly
medicinal
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
blueberry
presence
is
not
very
well
done
note
live
review
overall
this
beer
is
just
too
weird
7
5
abv
i
beg
to
differ
the
alc
is
undetectable
but
its
just
too
sour
and
tastes
like
dandelion
milk
oatmeal
stout
i
think
not
im
surprised
the
reviews
are
relatively
low
for
this
beer
i
feel
that
it
was
very
well
put
together
good
balance
of
flavor
without
being
too
heavy
in
any
single
department
my
only
complaint
is
the
somewhat
syrupy
nature
of
the
beer
which
may
lead
to
premature
palate
fatigue
not
something
id
stock
up
on
but
not
nearly
as
bad
as
others
made
it
sound
o
the
taste
was
terrible
it
tasted
like
blueberry
alcohol
and
plastic
i
would
not
drink
this
crap
again
well
this
one
certainly
has
a
blueberry
aroma
its
notable
immediately
upon
the
pour
it
has
a
grain
and
mild
oat
scent
as
well
i
imagined
something
like
oatmeal
for
breakfast
with
some
bitter
chocolate
and
blueberries
mixed
in
thats
not
quit
what
you
get
with
this
beer
but
the
scents
are
present
they
just
dont
come
together
perfectly
the
liquid
itself
is
a
deep
blackish
brown
color
with
a
lasting
lighttan
head
ever
present
carbonation
keeps
the
head
replenished
and
adds
some
distracting
bite
to
the
mouthfeel
drier
than
expected
and
theres
also
a
solid
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
better
than
average
stout
and
the
blueberry
isnt
as
overpowering
as
the
smell
forecasted
but
its
not
exceptional
by
any
means
strong
smoky
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
blueberry
no
surprise
there
it
pours
a
deep
sable
with
a
light
tan
head
that
leaves
about
average
lacing
flavor
has
firm
notes
of
molasses
coffee
blueberry
semisweet
chocolate
and
roast
malt
firmbodied
texture
has
a
decent
amount
of
fizz
if
you
like
fruit
beers
and
stouts
keep
your
eyes
peeled
for
this
one
o
the
first
blueberry
beer
i
have
ever
had
that
i
enjoyed
its
an
interesting
stout
and
far
from
the
norm
of
blueberry
beers
o
this
oatmeal
stout
has
some
great
and
unique
flavors
however
the
overcarbonation
made
me
not
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
should
have
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
the
blueberries
in
this
one
blend
well
with
the
grain
for
a
very
balanced
flavor
overall
to
be
honest
i
cant
stand
this
beer
lol
maybe
its
just
because
i
dont
like
stouts
but
i
thought
this
one
would
be
different
i
didnt
really
taste
any
oatmeal
either
ogood
beer
but
not
a
favorite
by
any
means
give
credit
to
a
small
brewer
though
it
is
an
ok
beer
it
is
different
from
the
seadog
blueberry
because
this
is
a
stout
it
is
a
very
good
attempt
and
is
well
worth
a
try
overall
i
am
not
happy
with
this
beer
luckily
it
has
a
high
abv
so
it
wasnt
a
total
waste
of
money
but
i
do
feel
like
ive
been
screwed
with
a
little
i
really
hope
the
orange
cream
ale
is
a
bit
better
than
this
one
the
aftertaste
is
almost
straight
up
wooden
which
could
be
a
good
thing
if
it
were
a
different
wood
than
cedar
which
leaves
its
presence
strongly
i
enjoyed
this
offering
overall
and
would
try
this
again
if
i
had
the
chance
as
ive
said
i
would
classify
this
a
bit
of
a
dessert
beer
and
that
is
not
meant
to
be
a
derogatory
observation
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
good
on
them
for
the
smell
it
actually
smells
like
blueberries
not
the
canned
oversweetened
pie
filler
kind
but
the
real
fruit
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
chocolately
malt
that
is
cut
pretty
quickly
by
a
some
blueberries
and
finishing
off
with
a
bit
of
coffee
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
average
with
some
light
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
the
only
one
ive
seen
in
the
style
o
definitely
not
as
bad
as
their
pumpkin
beer
and
definitely
not
a
drain
pour
but
this
was
just
too
chemically
synthetic
and
sweet
for
me
to
really
love
it
thanks
for
sharing
though
bryin
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
this
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
and
puts
up
a
1
tan
head
smells
of
blueberries
surprise
surprise
and
mild
chocolate
with
the
oats
giving
it
a
bready
aroma
taste
is
not
that
great
if
i
put
a
bunch
of
blueberries
in
my
armpits
and
ran
10
miles
and
put
the
into
a
beer
this
is
what
i
think
it
would
taste
like
somewhat
bitter
on
the
palate
good
carbonation
not
the
stout
i
reach
for
if
i
got
a
hankerin
for
one
d
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
this
one
is
certainly
more
fruitbeerlike
than
stoutlike
overall
its
just
a
mediocre
beer
overall
this
was
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
is
certainly
not
something
that
i
will
be
purchasing
again
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
combination
based
on
how
well
i
thought
they
did
with
their
pumpkin
ale
it
never
really
was
as
distinctive
as
it
should
have
been
blueberry
for
sure
the
appearance
is
very
nice
dark
and
rich
looking
after
that
just
goes
down
hill
the
aroma
is
nice
smells
like
blueberry
the
taste
like
an
unsweetened
blueberry
with
a
hit
of
what
seems
to
be
molasses
but
goes
down
with
a
syrupy
bitter
stickiness
not
horrible
but
i
think
this
is
a
one
hit
wonder
in
my
book
moderate
carbonation
with
biting
but
long
finish
overall
im
pretty
thrown
off
by
the
harsh
aspirinlike
bitterness
in
this
beer
dont
know
if
its
old
a
bad
batch
or
im
just
very
sensitive
to
whatever
flavor
combinations
exist
in
the
beer
wont
seek
out
d
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
one
sip
is
moderately
pleasant
the
next
makes
me
cringe
i
boo
this
offering
too
much
of
a
gimick
then
a
beer
overall
interesting
combination
i
love
the
blueberries
as
they
do
not
seem
artificial
as
some
blueberry
taste
can
wish
this
was
a
bit
less
bitter
but
i
would
still
get
it
again
i
prefer
dark
horse
tres
as
a
similar
beer
though
pours
a
brown
beer
with
a
fleeing
underfinger
of
light
latte
foam
the
beer
smells
of
blueberry
and
oatmeal
huh
spot
on
for
the
name
tastes
of
oats
and
peppercorns
and
some
sweet
cardboard
once
ive
tasted
it
when
i
smell
it
again
its
got
a
bit
of
a
musty
smell
to
it
medium
bodied
with
some
lighter
moderate
carb
meh
doa
oi
cant
get
by
the
metallic
aftertaste
in
this
one
overall
not
a
bad
concept
but
it
seems
a
little
halfhearted
i
only
say
that
due
to
the
blueberrys
lack
of
presence
had
it
been
a
little
more
prominent
this
brew
might
gained
a
little
more
noteworthiness
not
at
all
bad
tasting
though
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
of
artificial
blueberries
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
lighter
than
most
stout
the
taste
is
okay
blueberries
and
bitter
stout
but
not
something
id
get
again
its
a
nice
and
cloudy
dark
red
with
a
copious
amount
of
foam
the
aroma
has
a
decent
amount
of
blueberry
and
a
bit
of
wheat
the
taste
is
more
wheat
with
the
blueberry
component
more
noticeable
at
the
end
but
seeming
kind
of
artificial
its
quite
smooth
and
the
7
5
doesnt
come
on
fast
its
decent
o
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
and
i
am
usually
accepting
of
fruity
experiment
beers
but
this
lacked
many
qualities
of
a
good
oatmeal
stout
the
blueberry
was
pleasant
but
on
the
side
of
overwhelming
overall
too
bad
this
has
the
bitterness
the
blueberry
tastes
okay
but
there
seems
to
be
some
perfumy
floral
taste
going
on
not
really
my
thing
o
a
very
enjoyable
brew
in
all
aspects
im
beginning
to
think
there
may
be
something
to
this
buffalo
bills
o
my
first
buffalo
bills
beer
and
disappointed
i
think
ive
heard
good
things
about
their
pumpkin
ale
this
was
pretty
bad
not
much
works
with
this
beer
at
all
not
a
drain
pour
but
damn
close
definitely
stay
away
unless
you
need
the
tic
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
not
an
award
winner
but
certainly
a
good
all
around
beer
also
the
first
blueberry
beer
ive
had
thats
any
good
two
things
on
the
palate
its
got
a
lot
of
tartness
and
the
alcohol
is
out
of
whack
i
was
a
bit
nervous
when
i
saw
the
7
2
on
the
label
and
it
is
hot
o
with
the
exception
of
the
look
and
smell
this
beer
redeemed
itself
to
become
quite
a
nice
beverage
well
balanced
flavors
not
being
overly
sweet
and
a
nicely
textured
mouthfeel
i
feel
that
this
is
a
well
done
take
on
a
fruity
style
of
stout
one
knock
id
give
it
though
is
that
especially
as
it
starts
to
warm
the
booze
becomes
increasingly
noticeable
in
both
aroma
and
taste
otherwise
a
decent
brew
o
my
first
impression
was
oh
boy
this
is
going
to
be
awful
fruit

its

pretty

with

d
overall
whats
to
expect
you
get
blueberry
full
of
flavor
and
smell
on
top
of
slight
chocolate
and
bitter
tones
of
a
stout
simple
but
perfect
if
this
sticks
around
i
may
pick
up
a
whole
sixer
on
the
cheap
good
brew
overall
i
like
this
im
all
for
people
trying
stouts
with
dark
red
or
berry
fruits
if
you
like
blueberries
and
fruit
beers
you
will
like
this
another
intriguing
winter
seasonal
a
nice
medium
bodied
stout
with
an
authentic
blueberry
undertone
pours
a
mahogony
brown
with
light
edges
some
light
shows
through
aromas
are
enticing
with
loads
of
blueberry
and
chocolate
malt
flavor
is
mellow
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
finish
reveals
all
of
the
blueberry
with
a
berry
skin
aftertaste
that
makes
it
seem
like
you
ate
a
fresh
one
well
balanced
oddly
bitter
finish
that
seems
almost
like
a
berry
tannin
pair
with
chocolate
and
were
in
business
dthe
weird
bitterness
along
with
the
the
rubbing
alcohol
and
the
complete
lack
of
any
malt
notes
render
this
one
almost
totally
undrinkable
had
to
drainpour
this
one
d
alcoholic
tasting
as
well
as
fruity
i
might
have
one
in
a
night
dark
pour
with
no
head
to
speak
of
like
blueberry
juice
and
dark
rootbeer
smells
sweet
not
much
else
a
piney
and
woody
taste
up
front
with
a
sweet
noticeable
blue
berry
back
actually
more
complex
than
i
thought
it
would
be
complex
but
not
entirely
pleasant
good
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
plenty
of
small
medio
carbonation
not
too
drinkable
maybe
one
was
enough
do
not
recommend
ive
found
buffalo
bills
to
be
a
quirky
brewery
but
one
which
makes
interesting
beers
or
at
least
they
were
interesting
in
the
90s
when
everyone
else
was
just
doing
paleamberstout
combinations
this
one
is
frankly
just
not
very
good
pours
into
a
black
body
with
a
large
tan
head
that
has
decent
retention
good
carbonation
and
reallly
good
lacing
the
smell
is
some
chocolate
hints
of
malts
and
hops
but
mostly
all
blueberry
the
taste
is
strong
with
blueberries
and
chocolate
with
hints
of
malts
hops
oats
and
a
pine
taste
to
it
it
has
a
dry
finish
to
the
taste
with
some
bitter
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
yet
rather
dry
the
sweetness
of
the
blueberries
and
the
bitterness
of
the
chocolate
is
very
well
balanced
and
with
the
smoothness
the
oats
provide
make
this
a
nice
drinkable
beer
very
good
beer
and
for
just
1
59
not
a
bad
price
either
drinkability
is
good
this
stout
is
definitely
different
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
but
not
a
beer
that
i
regret
having
either
worth
a
try
good
drinkability
although
im
not
sure
if
i
could
handle
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
drinkabilityvery
drinkable
somewhat
nice
id
recommend
this
to
a
bridge
the
gap
for
someone
new
to
stout
for
me
i
wish
it
had
more
body
and
a
bit
more
malt
complexity
hopes
were
high
since
i
love
blueberries
as
well
as
stouts
but
this
i
will
not
be
drinking
again
pours
an
opaque
purplish
black
with
a
soft
creamcolored
head
that
fell
fast
sort
of
a
wet
viscosity
and
only
minor
lacing
the
blueberry
dominates
the
scent
and
combines
with
bready
malty
sweetness
to
create
a
very
blueberrymuffinlike
aroma
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
and
smooth
drinks
nice
and
easy
particularly
for
a
7
5
abv
with
less
blueberry
in
the
flavor
than
id
have
anticipated
based
on
the
smell
taste
in
general
is
malty
and
pleasant
a
little
grainybready
there
is
some
mild
carbonation
spikiness
and
a
wet
creamy
mouthfeel
on
the
front
end
which
overlaps
into
a
contrastingly
clean
smooth
almost
dry
middle
then
the
subtle
tart
blueberry
notes
become
a
little
more
noticeable
along
with
some
mellow
but
distinct
herbal
hop
bite
in
the
finish
slight
blueberry
notes
hang
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
while
doing
nothing
really
wrong
its
somehow
not
quite
mindblowing
but
this
is
certainly
a
neatly
balanced
very
drinkable
stout
that
doesnt
let
the
sweetness
of
its
theme
overpower
in
fact
it
is
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
a
stout
i
would
happily
drink
again
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
dryish
mouthfeel
very
full
but
not
chewy
its
drinkable
and
interesting
but
its
such
an
odd
combination
i
cant
decide
whether
its
just
interesting
or
if
its
more
than
that
if
only
it

i

which
i
enjoyed
overall
i
kind
of
enjoyed
this
though
i
would
say
this
is
a
porter
rather
than
a
classic
stout
i
had
held
out
on
this
prior
due
to
bo
wanting
a
fruity
beer
it
is
not
fruity
yup
this
one
works
and
conjures
up
the
thought
of
being
a
breakfast
beer
the
blueberry
and
roasted
malt
play
well
together
balance
is
key
and
this
beer
is
right
on
track
drinkability
a
good
sipper
and
surprisingly
moreish
just
expect
something
unusual
and
youll
be
satisfied
even
with
the
high
alcohol
i
never
got
that
burning
feeling
in
the
back
of
my
throat
its
a
good
tasting
creamy
beer
than
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
poured
into
a
snifter
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
blueberry
aroma
the
blueberry
doesnt
totally
overshadow
everything
else
it
works
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
you
get
a
nice
roasty
note
up
front
then
the
finish
is
all
blueberry
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
for
the
style
this
was
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
the
idea
for
this
one
was
okay
but
it
didnt
work
out
too
well
the
blueberry
flavor
was
nice
but
the
stout
part
came
up
a
little
short
chocolate
blueberry
pie
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
well
enough
and
the
body
lacks
the
creaminess
of
a
good
oaty
stout
this
should
most
definitely
be
classified
as
a
fruit
beer
as
the
blueberry
is
quite
prominent
calling
it
an
imperial
stout
is
not
cool
the
blueberry
tartness
clashes
with
the
chocolaty
and
roasty
malt
which
i
am
glad
it
has
in
the
fist
place
i
can
actually
finish
this
not
sure
i
would
make
it
going
into
this
beast
most
definitely
not
worthy
of
a
sixpack
purchase
but
makes
for
a
decent
little
novelty
brew
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
rich
color
with
specks
of
oatmeal
dancing
around
in
the
glass
a
nice
hint
of
blueberry
aroma
which
was
not
in
any
way
overpowering
the
beer
was
smooth
going
down
with
more
hints
of
blueberries
and
malts
a
very
enjoyable
beer

highly
recommend
im
pretty
sure
i
will
be
buying
this
again
shortly
overall
a
decent
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
d
yeah
you
can
drink
this
but
i
wouldnt
advise
in
buying
it
drinks
okay
but
too
much
blueberry
not
enough
stout
going
on
for
me
right
here
one
done
for
me
if
id
read
the
label
closer
i
wouldve
ditched
this
for
some
reason
i
thought
pyramid
did
this
time
to
start
carrying
some
reading
glasses
on
my
beer
safaris
pours
a
light
and
clear
brown
color
with
no
head
just
a
few
white
bubbles
here
and
there
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
very
blueberry
with
a
subtle
malty
aroma
to
balance
it
this
is
echoed
in
the
flavor
which
is
also
sweet
and
the
blend
of
strong
blueberry
flavor
and
the
supporting
maltiness
creates
the
illusion
of
a
blueberry
pancakes
in
liquid
form
the
body
however
is
very
light
and
slightly
flat
which
brings
out
a
little
tartness
and
makes
the
drink
and
finish
very
quick
more
body
and
perhaps
a
more
grain
flavored
malt
and
this
is
a
beer
you
can
drink
at
breakfast
with
some
eggs
and
bacon
does
not
match
up
like
it
should
first
thing
is
this
is
from
a
bottle
thats
over
a
year
old
interesting
poured
aggresively
and
got
a
small
to
medium
fine
tan
head
and
some
lace
head
quickly
settled
to
a
thin
cover
color
is
an
opaque
brownish
black
aroma
is
blueberry
traditional
stout
flavors
about
the
same
nice
thing
is
the
blueberry
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
actually
not
too
bad
although
it
wouldnt
be
one
of
my
favs
little
bit
of
a
weird
finish
dont
pick
up
much
of
the
alcohol
d
easy
to
drink
despite
being
overly
carbonated
i
could
drink
it
all
night
however
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
id
drink
it
again
but
there
are
def
better
options
out
there
this
was
a
different
stout
for
sure
im
just
not
sure
if
its
a
good
different
its
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
most
stouts
and
pretty
thin
in
feel
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
probably
not
purchase
it
again
d
overall
not
outstanding
but
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
solely
for
its
uniqueness
worth
a
shot
thats
all
i
got
on
this
one
give
it
a
try
if
you
enjoy
fruit
beers
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
definitely
different
not
awful
at
all
but
not
that
good
just
different
its
an
ok
drinking
beer
i
dont
think
ill
ever
have
again
one
of
buffalo
bills
gimmicky
beers
i
guess
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
if
this
were
a
normal
american
stout
and
not
an
imperial
my
ratings
would
be
even
higher
overall
not
awful
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
from
an
oatmeal
stout
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
not
very
good
americal
pale
ale
infused
with
blueberries
i
dont
plan
on
getting
this
again
and
its
not
something
i
would
recommend
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
body
with
a
huge
tan
head
average
sized
bubbles
somewhat
diminishing
very
hoppy
aroma
some
acidic
fruit
too
light
fruit
taste
berries
some
roasted
notes
too
inhaling
deep
blueberry
fruit
almost
a
fake
taste
plasticy
blueberry
aftertaste
some
graininess
but
not
very
good
sour
more
roasted
as
it
warms
but
still
that
fake
fruit
taste
or
something
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
not
offensive
but
not
very
good
either
a
bit
bitter
bottle
into
english
pint
poured
a
creamy
dark
brown
almost
black
with
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
at
first
smacks
of
the
blueberry
smell
but
over
time
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
comes
forward
the
most
surprising
however
was
the
subtlety
of
the
blueberry
in
the
mouth
a
lively
carbonation
helps
to
pull
the
malts
forward
with
the
blueberry
actually
as
a
nice
undertone
enhancing
the
roasted
flavors
there
is
a
nice
smooth
finish
as
both
flavors
linger
just
long
enough
to
entice
the
next
sip
d
this
beer
is
palatable
and
just
overall
good
it
is
one
of
the
best
applications
of
blueberry
that
i
can
recall
probably
not
the
choice
for
ris
drinkers
though
overall
better
than
most
beers
with
fruit
very
drinkable
beer
interesting
new
to
bc
this
is
a
better
beer
than
the
bottle
and
the
concept
appears
pours
like
a
standard
stout
but
the
blueberry
notes
pick
up
in
the
nose
and
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
nice
fruit
note
with
the
blueberry
but
not
overbearing
not
the
biggest
stout
but
still
reasonably
full
bodied
for
the
style
worth
trying
one
to
two
a
novelty
that
turns
out
to
be
good
flavor
is
similarly
mild
some
lightly
tart
fruit
and
vague
toast
flavor
it
disappears
fast
on
the
palate
sort
of
sweet
at
first
becoming
dry
in
the
finish
average
body
its
not
something
id
reach
for
again
but
a
decent
transition
beer
for
the
noncraft
drinker
12oz
was
from
a
gift
pack
sampler
poured
a
black
color
with
good
carbonatio
and
a
tannish
head
nose
is
whhhholly
blueberry
to
much
berry
no
enough
oats
taste
is
pretty
thin
blueberry
heavy
not
much
oats
but
a
roastiness
going
on
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
dominated
by
roasted
malt
hints
of
oats
being
smothered
by
bllueberry
no
way
will
i
try
this
again
but
someone
else
might
dig
it
drinkability
while
a
moderately
heavy
beer
just
by
nature
it
is
a
stout
the
blueberry
provides
the
cleaner
finish
than
you
would
expect
with
an
oatmeal
stout
fans
of
oatmeal
stouts
will
appreciate
the
different
take
without
an
overpowering
variation
drinkability
a
solid
stout
but
i
would
pass
on
it
in
a
heartbeat
very
low
compelxity
for
an
imperial
stout
if
thats
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
then
a
plus
also
its
gettign
worse
as
it
gets
warmer
d
i
liked
drinking
this
beer
but
one
at
a
time
was
enough
it
was
just
too
sweet
the
three
major
flavors
roasted
malt
hops
and
blueberry
were
all
good
but
all
very
individual
they
didnt
really
balance
or
work
together
this
is
a
very
odd
combo
of
flavors
didnt
really
work
for
me
will
not
be
getting
again
the
beer
is
complex
and
doesnt
overcommit
in
any
given
direction
but
its
weight
and
the
blueberry
character
certainly
limit
it
to
no
more
than
a
couple
of
pints
still
its
a
great
beer
for
the
cooler
months
and
im
glad
to
have
picked
it
up
there
wont
be
any
trouble
finishing
these
off
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
light
beige
one
finger
head
lingers
above
a
black
body
aroma
is
of
blueberry
and
maybe
some
toasted
malts
i
suppose
it
smells
about
what
i
expected
after
having
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
smells
refreshing
actually
taste
is
less
sweet
than
expected
after
considering
the
aroma
no
alcohol
heat
noted
taste
is
malty
with
notes
of
blueberry
of
course
pretty
smooth
overall
not
very
complex
but
a
very
tasty
treat
and
interesting
and
pleasing
fairly
drinkable
but
dont
buy
this
expecting
a
stout
buy
this
if
you
are
seeking
a
blueberry
beer
overall
a
fun
stout
to
try
in
a
smaller
serving
good
capturing
of
the
wild
blueberries
complex
and
challenging
but
not
overly
heavy
mouthfeeldrinkability
good
heavy
beer
that
still
retains
some
good
sweetness
lightly
carbonated
but
overall
an
interesting
choice
of
style
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
an
interesting
bluberry
beer
that
pours
far
darker
and
heavier
than
most
fruit
beers
the
stout
gives
ita
good
full
body
and
the
blueberry
aroma
is
definitely
there
but
not
overwhelming
tastes
very
smooth
on
the
mouth
and
was
very
easily
drinkable
an
excellent
winter
beer
with
a
summer
taste
pours
dark
brown
to
nearly
black
with
offwhite
head
nose
has
a
true
blueberry
aroma
not
artificial
contrary
to
what
others
have
said
some
roasty
notes
are
in
the
nose
as
well
this
comes
through
on
the
palate
as
well
with
some
dusty
cocoa
and
of
course
blueberry
sweetness
hop
bite
at
the
end
rather
easy
drinking
even
with
the
fruit
component
d
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
see
some
others
like
it
seems
to
be
hit
or
miss
really
summary
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
fruit
beer
or
just
something
different
give
this
one
a
try
i
dunno
why
the
reviews
are
so
meh
about
this
beer
maybe
its
from
people
who
dont
like
stouts
or
only
like
conventional
stouts
or
are
turned
off
by
the
fact
that
it
is
contract
brewed
corporate
hands
the
people
who
hate
corporations
sure
seem
to
be
judgmental
and
close
minded
but
thats
another
topic
on
it
or
who
knows
maybe
they
just
dont
like
this
stout
i
happen
to
like
it
very
much
overall
im
not
a
stout
fan
but
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
considering
my
favorite
stout
is
dark
horses
tres
to
me
when
i
think
of
stout
i
think
of
malts
and
theres
no
malt
taste
to
this
beer
i
say
buy
a
single
first
or
dont
even
waste
your
money
d
this
bottle
is
enough
for
me
i
didnt
feel
like
i
was
choking
it
down
but
i
definitely
wont
care
for
another
the
blueberry
flavor
that
i
perceived
as
synthesized
was
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
disappointing
drinkability
is
this
ever
disappointing
but
then
again
i
wasnt
expecting
much
given
my
past
experiences
with
this
brewery
drinkability
is
low
i
finished
this
out
of
respect
for
beer
in
general
but
ill
never
drink
this
again
not
a
hint
of
blueberry
anywhere
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
ecru
foam
smell
and
taste
is
dominated
by
blueberries
followed
by
notes
of
dark
roasted
grains
cocoa
dusted
dried
blueberries
and
milk
chocolate
roasty
bitter
and
sweet
a
notch
better
than
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
for
the
style
one
of
the
better
blueberry
flavored
beers
on
the
market
worth
a
try
if
you
dig
blueberries
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
i
dont
mind
buffalo
bills
brews
their
orange
blossom
is
pretty
good
and
their
pumpkin
ale
is
okay
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
i
believe
so
it
might
be
kind
of
hard
to
find
in
the
summer
but
if
you
can
find
it
check
it
out
the
sixpack
wont
last
long
as
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
very
nice
blueberry
auroma
but
slightly
lacking
in
berry
flavor
definitely
interesting
and
worth
trying
one
if
you
get
the
chance
drinkability
no
thank
you
if
youre
in
desperate
need
for
a
blueberrybased
stout
please
turn
your
attention
rightfully
to
dark
horses
tres
blueberry
stout
the
unrewarding
blueberry
flavoring
couldnt
and
could
never
make
up
for
a
deficient
stout
stout
and
blueberries
sounds
like
a
nice
combo
but
not
quite
so
in
this
beer
not
offensive
just
disappointing
another
ba
described
the
taste
as
liquid
blueberry
oatmeal
and
that
pretty
much
nails
this
beer
on
the
head
surprisingly
pleasant
i
think
this
stout
does
a
servicable
job
striking
a
balance
between
fruity
sweetness
and
the
oats
and
malts
an
easy
drinking
stout
and
while
it
may
seem
gimmicky
and
i
did
pick
it
up
on
a
whim
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
huh
ba
says
this
is
7
5
no
freakin
way
d
the
blueberry
flavor
is
a
nice
change
but
its
not
something
i
could
have
to
many
of
d
fun
but
could
get
tiring
overall
get
it
on
draft
if
you
can
the
beer
moves
up
one
whole
range
in
my
opinion
the
bottles
are
ok
if
you
can
get
them
for
cheap
i
know
that
grocery
depot
in
california
tends
to
carry
buffalo
bills
6packs
for
45
bucks
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
lighter
amber
along
the
edges
54
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
strongly
of
blueberries
slight
hops
and
hints
of
roasted
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
double
imperial
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
not
thick
like
many
other
double
stouts
but
not
a
watery
feel
tastes
of
blueberries
upfront
very
slight
hop
background
and
finish
is
roasted
malts
theres
a
dryness
associated
with
this
brew
im
not
getting
a
lot
out
of
this
besides
the
blueberries
as
far
as
malt
and
hops
a
new
type
of
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
not
really
my
forte
edit
i
just
bought
another
6pack
of
this
and
it
lacks
a
bit
from
the
other
ones
ive
had
i
think
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
has
much
variation
from
each
brew
they
make
if
you
didnt
like
it
the
first
time
give
it
a
try
again
maybe
itll
be
from
one
of
the
better
brews
they
did
the
beer
poured
a
very
thin
head
which
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
dark
coloration
like
typical
oatmeal
stouts
and
had
the
texture
of
a
typical
one
the
smell
wasnt
bad
however
i
found
both
the
smell
and
taste
referring
to
the
blueberries
more
absent
of
the
blueberry
i
would
have
preferred
subtle
is
good
absent
is
less
so
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
brew
but
just
a
very
average
one
certainly
ive
had
worse
blueberry
beers
and
its
worth
trying
the
texture
of
the
stout
was
typical
and
i
was
glad
that
it
didnt
have
a
syrupy
flavor
to
it
we
split
the
single
12oz
between
us
so
i
didnt
get
as
many
sips
as
id
usually
have
to
work
out
the
flavor
profile
by
taste
alone
im
not
sure
i
could
have
identified
this
as
blueberry
somethingberry
yes
but
if
you
told
me
it
was
blackberry
or
raspberry
i
might
have
believed
you
but
the
nose
definitely
gives
it
away
its
unmistakable
dark
ebony
with
a
thick
finger
of
sand
colored
foam
that
leaves
some
fine
lace
behind
smells
pretty
blueberry
heavy
with
roasted
malt
tastes
more
blueberry
than
anything
else
otherwise
a
fairly
dry
lighter
than
most
stout
with
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
oatmeal
comes
through
in
the
creamy
chalky
mouthfeel
a
decent
brew
thats
a
little
too
light
for
an
imperial
stout
but
better
than
other
bbs
beer
that
ive
had
in
the
past
the
aroma
had
a
faint
blueberry
smell
to
it
and
not
much
more
it
was
pretty
bitter
and
a
little
sour
in
the
mouth
it
left
a
bittering
note
on
the
top
of
the
mouth
overall
it
seem
very
thin
lacked
smoothness
i
am
used
to
with
an
oatmeal
stout
the
label
was
more
appealing
than
the
beer
itself
the
7
5
percent
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
it
is
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
my
dad
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
from
the
store
after
recently
visiting
their
brewery
and
tasting
most
of
what
they
had
to
offer
i
was
not
exactly
jumping
for
joy
to
try
a
bottle
but
i
got
around
to
it
and
today
poured
into
a
stone
pint
glass
color
is
dark
brown
color
with
purple
highlights
thin
vanilla
colored
head
that
lasted
about
five
minutes
not
much
lacing
read
that
there
was
thirty
pounds
of
blueberries
in
each
batch
and
i
believe
it
after
sticking
my
nose
in
my
glass
pretty
much
dominates
except
for
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
artificial
sweetness
taste
was
straight
fruit
at
first
then
faded
into
some
dark
malts
but
not
many
it
is
a
bit
tart
and
it
does
not
work
at
all
with
the
other
flavors
just
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
mostly
cloyingly
sweet
with
some
roastiness
medium
bodied
pretty
flat
as
far
as
carbonation
goes
could
not
drink
more
than
six
ounces
of
it
just
finished
pouring
the
rest
down
the
drain
another
beer
i
would
never
drink
again
from
these
guys
probably
will
steer
clear
of
this
brewery
period
in
the
future
not
recommended
got
all
excited
over
this
one
in
the
grocery
store
i
love
stouts
and
blueberries
looks
like
a
stout
but
the
head
is
there
and
gone
in
a
second
initial
aroma
is
medicinal
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
lacks
that
stout
body
this
is
lighter
than
a
porter
too
taste
is
begging
for
more
stout
and
less
fruit
the
bitterness
is
pronounced
as
well
as
some
blueberry
sweetness
with
a
tart
finish
tastes
better
as
it
warms
up
but
near
the
end
a
flat
beer
disappointed
this
soft
fruity
beer
met
my
expectations
this
was
just
ok
enough
blueberry
was
present
but
it
overall
didnt
seem
to
meld
well
with
the
stout
qualities
i
was
one
and
done
with
this
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
they
were
quickly
quashed
if
there
was
more
of
a
stout
to
stand
up
to
the
blueberry
this
could
actually
be
great
but
the
stout
wasnt
there
and
the
blueberry
definitely
was
not
awful
but
not
really
enjoyable
a
novel
idea
that
is
fun
for
a
sip
or
two
but
not
quite
solid
enough
to
enjoy
the
whole
bottle
future
outlook
not
a
terrible
beer
and
was
fine
for
a
novel
experience
but
not
something
worth
revisiting
id
be
interested
in
trying
a
full
bodied
creamy
blueberryoatmeal
stout
if
one
exists
but
this
one
doesnt
fill
that
bill
taste
is
pretty
mellow
for
a
stout
the
blueberries
come
through
well
but
not
too
strong
very
mellow
in
the
stout
department
a
bit
fizzy
as
well
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
weak
overall
edit
future
tastings
of
this
are
actually
making
me
think
its
even
worse
the
hops
in
the
finish
combined
with
that
off
burnt
plastic
flavor
really
make
this
a
complete
dud
i
normally
dont
change
reviews
but
every
subsequent
bottle
has
made
me
think
this
was
even
worse
than
the
last
worst
beer
ive
had
in
years
pours
a
nice
dark
black
although
with
only
a
bit
of
initial
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
good
scent
a
huge
whiff
of
blueberry
along
with
a
nice
bit
of
burnt
grain
and
smidge
of
coffee
nice
taste
decent
stout
characteristics
on
the
way
in
notably
a
bit
of
coffee
and
some
nice
dark
grains
a
huge
mouth
of
blueberry
at
the
end
of
the
drink
mixes
nicely
after
swallowing
booberry
cereal
and
coffee
for
breakfast
no
one
taste
is
completely
dominant
which
helped
too
much
blueberry
wouldve
been
bad
goes
down
quite
well
for
a
higher
abv
stout
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
feel
that
the
blueberry
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
clashes
too
much
with
the
roasted
malts
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
sugary
blueberry
is
all
i
get
in
the
taste
sweet
oatmeal
light
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
blueberry
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
roasty
malt
and
small
small
blueberry
aftertaste
interesting
blueberry
a
bit
light
overall
but
ok
poured
a
nice
dark
color
like
it
should
and
left
the
perfect
head
because
of
my
pouring
expertise
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
so
i
was
excited
to
see
it
added
with
blueberries
and
buffalo
bills
did
not
let
me
down
oh
good
lord
it
smelled
like
those
blueberry
pancakes
mama
used
to
make
but
not
too
strong
just
enough
to
taste
the
berries
the
taste
was
great
too
a
great
balanced
stout
with
just
the
right
flavor
of
the
berry
went
down
nice
and
smooth
all
6
of
them
this
oatmeal
stout
reminds
me
of
my
childhood
i
spent
many
a
summers
eating
oatmeal
with
blueberries
it
had
a
very
pleasing
aroma
of
blueberries
the
taste
was
very
appealing
with
hints
of
blueberries
and
hops
i
enjoyed
this
beer
to
the
fullest
potential
drinkability
is
very
solid
given
the
style
of
fruit
stout
and
its
strength
i
would
say
this
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
but
its
also
fine
to
drink
on
whenever
its
around
ohh
a
blueberry
belch
poured
a
leather
couch
brown
with
some
seethruness
and
a
thin
head
that
died
quickly
and
didnt
leave
lace
blueberry
notes
abound
but
thats
all
im
smelling
like
i
am
smelling
blueberry
syrup
a
little
too
sharp
blueberry
taste
and
a
rather
thin
body
give
this
beer
which
is
smooth
and
contains
a
good
malt
base
somewhat
of
a
fruit
soda
overcarbonation
feel
not
a
bad
beer
and
the
abv
is
hidden
but
this
reminded
me
a
little
of
cherry
soda
with
the
crispness
a
little
too
much
if
they
tweak
the
blueberry
tartness
they
could
have
a
great
beer
here
drinkability
fruity
beer
so
that
usually
gives
this
category
some
points
for
me
higher
abv
though
also
not
very
much
sticking
to
the
style
i
dont
mind
deviation
but
this
just
seems
a
big
jump
too
much
blueberry
sweetness
which
tastes
fine
but
could
use
more
worth
trying
however
notes
from
3608
drinkability
not
the
greatest
ill
be
finishing
this
pint
but
im
fairly
sure
that
this
one
will
be
my
last
perhaps
ill
give
it
a
chance
again
if
i
ever
find
it
on
tap
there
isnt
alot
wrong
with
this
brew
just
nothing
too
great
i
just
normally
dont
appreciate
fruit
beers
and
especially
traditional
beer
styles
with
a
bunch
of
fruit
thrown
in
again
not
for
me
but
alot
of
people
will
probably
appreciate
it
d
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
the
smell
is
about
what
it
should
be
but
everything
else
falls
short
i
picked
up
the
single
because
dark
horses
blueberry
stout
isnt
available
yet
and
this
one
didnt
satisfy
the
craving
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
or
this
would
have
been
a
complete
disaster
d
very
drinkable
doent
really
taste
that
heavy
i
could
have
another
one
at
a
bar
d
this
is
my
first
fruit
stout
and
blueberry
is
a
nice
touch
with
the
creamy
stout
well
balanced
ill
look
for
this
one
again
m
thinnish
shared
a
case
with
friends
this
beer
is
good
in
a
surprising
way
as
in
its
good
not
great
but
pleasantly
surprising
at
first
look
at
the
label
i
didnt
think
blueberries
could
stand
up
to
the
dark
malts
but
buffalo
bills
nailed
a
good
balance
blueberries
juicy
upfront
that
fade
into
more
subtle
dark
chocolate
malts
and
a
hint
of
smooth
oats
worth
a
try
easily
the
best
blueberry
beer
ive
had
and
i
dont
usually
like
blueberry
beers
d
its
nice
to
have
but
notnice
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
an
apple
walnut
salad
in
the
end
i
appreciate
the
balance
and
aggression
that
this
beer
displays
but
in
the
end
the
conflict
of
flavors
and
textures
cause
the
beer
to
be
problematic
and
hurts
the
drinkability
the
beer
as
all
buffalo
bills
beers
do
has
a
raw
homebrewed
quality
to
them
that
i
really
do
appreciate
keep
up
the
work
and
keep
challenging
us
d
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
stout
it
was
a
complete
letdown
for
me
the
taste
was
awful
and
i
could
barely
finish
one
beer
this
was
the
closest
ive
ever
come
to
a
drain
pour
the
body
is
good
for
a
beer
of
this
style
and
has
excellent
mouthfeel
thisi
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
as
a
session
ale
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
roasty
easy
to
drink
had
no
idea
the
alc
was
7
5
drinkability
i
enjoyed
the
blending
of
this
stout
enough
fruit
to
make
its
presence
known
without
being
cloying
and
enough
roasted
barley
bitterness
to
balance
the
fruit
without
drowning
it
out
a
cola
brown
in
color
overall
with
very
dark
garnet
highlights
nice
light
beige
twofingered
head
that
recedes
slowly
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
blueberry
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
but
still
has
a
noticeable
backbone
of
roasted
malt
and
oats
taste
starts
wih
some
lightly
roasted
oats
then
some
soft
bread
then
the
middle
is
all
blueberry
jelly
the
finish
then
combines
the
roasted
malts
and
sweet
blueberries
togther
great
dry
oatmeal
palate
with
a
splash
of
juiciness
from
the
blueberries
overall
impression
smells
good
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
back
it
up
i
think
its
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
getting
through
this
six
pack
this
is
decent
but
its
not
terribly
smooth
unfortunately
blueberry
aroma
is
nicer
than
the
flavor
not
bad
for
a
novelty
now
and
again
i
suppose
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
than
their
orange
blossom
offering
alcopop
and
i
remember
their
pumpkin
ale
not
being
so
hot
the
blueberry
is
just
strong
enough
to
give
some
flair
but
not
overdone
enough
to
intrude
a
unique
and
laudable
beer
that
is
impressive
without
being
mindblowing
chuck
some
more
malt
and
blueberry
in
it
and
it
might
just
be
a
killer
probably
wouldnt
have
another
in
quite
some
time
but
i
look
forward
to
another
meeting
with
it
somewhere
down
the
road
drinkability
wierd
flavor
combo
makes
this
a
unique
beer
to
try
but
more
than
one
bottle
would
not
be
an
option
for
me
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
almost
like
coffee
tones
and
blueberry
flavor
carries
the
blueberry
too
of
course
but
there
is
a
biting
tang
that
kind
of
detracts
a
bit
still
it
is
decent
though
pretty
robust
character
overall
sweet
tangy
tones
are
there
for
sure
feel
has
a
biting
carbonation
a
bit
and
the
liquid
is
fairly
well
bodied
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
fruit
stout
i
cant
say
i
have
had
a
lot
of
them
but
this
one
is
working
pretty
well
drinkability
ok
d
i
picked
this
up
at
oaktree
in
nj
as
a
single
marked
vintage
no
date
present
whatsoever
so
im
not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
it
was
the
last
one
they
had
on
the
shelf
i
have
a
feeling
it
was
somewhat
dated
ill
try
it
again
when
i
know
its
fresh
but
in
the
condition
i
drank
this
id
have
to
say
that
one
would
be
enough
for
me
thick
at
first
the
carbonation
leads
this
one
towards
the
medium
category
chewy
but
not
overly
so
drying
near
the
end
with
the
touch
of
blueberries
that
only
comes
in
the
nose
and
onthe
end
unique
different
and
worth
a
few
d
actually
not
bad
a
strange
and
unique
combination
that
works
to
some
extent
wouldnt
drink
in
multiples
but
worth
a
try
to
see
for
oneself
i
was
not
disappointed
its
a
typical
quality
oatmeal
stout
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
it
has
a
subtle
but
noticeable
blueberry
nose
the
blueberry
flavor
is
similarly
subtle
but
pleasant
and
noticeable
in
the
taste
a
surprisingly
good
match
with
the
sweeter
oatmeal
stout
style
this
beer
is
a
candidate
for
a
session
beer
and
might
even
be
a
good
stout
to
drink
well
into
spring
this
one
would
pair
well
with
blueberry
waffles
or
pancakes
as
one
to
drink
alone
well
it
lags
a
bit
there
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
ale
my
first
review
isnt
that
good
and
orange
blossom
cream
ale
is
even
worse
even
though
blueberry
oatmeal
stout
is
the
best
of
the
lot
it
isnt
good
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
if
youre
curious
start
with
a
single
d
didnt
read
the
abv
on
the
bottle
and
was
quite
surprised
well
hidden
and
expected
not
to
like
good
surprise
i
poured
this
strange
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
black
as
tar
and
had
a
big
tan
head
the
smell
was
nice
and
really
had
the
blueberrys
too
it
the
tase
however
was
a
clash
i
thought
the
blueberry
was
fake
tasting
and
really
soapy
or
perfummie
taseting
i
will
not
buy
again
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
excellent
taste
with
a
very
good
smooth
mouthfeel
to
compliment
the
taste
definitely
a
wellrounded
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
with
the
higher
alcohol
content
and
the
fruit
backing
the
body
i
imagine
some
folks
wouldnt
dig
it
too
much
but
especially
since
im
not
a
big
blueberry
brew
fan
this
won
me
over
and
around
9
a
sixpack
is
certainly
a
good
deal
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sticky
mouthfeel
carbonation
helps
to
cut
come
of
the
stickiness
i
couldnt
resist
picking
this
up
when
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
i
must
admit
i
was
skeptical
but
it
delivered
as
i
hoped
it
would
worthy
of
a
try
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
out
there
but
a
nice
unique
take
on
one
the
7
50
abv
is
pretty
detectable
here
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
experience
at
all
this
was
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
that
ive
tried
lately
but
i
was
just
a
bit
let
down
by
this
theres
a
lot
of
potential
here
but
everything
comes
up
just
a
bit
short
this
is
filling
easydrinking
and
not
overpowering
but
if
i
had
some
blueberries
with
me
id
squeeze
a
few
a
toss
em
in
thats
all
this
beer
is
missing
a
must
try
i
like
the
fruit
stouts
the
flavors
seem
to
match
up
better
than
lighter
beers
this
one
isnt
perfect
but
a
very
nice
sipper
id
pick
this
up
again
browsing
around
the
bottle
king
in
glen
ridge
i
saw
something
that
immediately
caught
my
eye
blueberry
oatmeal
stout
not
one
to
pass
up
an
invitation
on
so
interesting
a
combination
i
was
eager
to
give
this
one
a
try
being
a
fan
of
blueberries
in
general
and
having
a
strong
liking
for
oatmeal
stouts
this
was
certainly
something
different
my
only
other
beer
from
this
company
was
their
pumpkin
ale
which
i
really
enjoyed
so
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
go
pours
a
deep
dark
chocolate
color
that
gave
way
to
a
decent
amount
of
foam
that
lingered
for
a
bit
smell
is
outofthis
world
with
a
very
strong
aroma
of
fresh
blueberries
that
just
bursts
out
the
taste
was
somewhat
peculiar
different
but
very
satisfying
the
blueberry
element
was
definitely
there
but
stronger
in
smell
than
in
taste
the
stout
flavor
really
pulls
through
and
the
brew
packs
quite
a
punch
with
a
hefty
7
5
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
was
good
but
being
such
a
strange
combination
with
a
pretty
high
alcohol
content
drinkability
is
only
average
as
i
wouldnt
want
to
down
more
than
two
in
a
single
setting
if
you
can
find
this
one
definitely
recommended
drinkability
pretty
good
but
i
cant
see
drinking
a
sixpack
of
this
in
one
sitting
i
would
weakly
recommend
this
beer
overall
i
enjoy
the
beer
but
theres
a
lot
wrong
with
it
first
off
theres
no
oatmeal
if
youre
going
to
advertise
oatmeal
stout
on
the
label
i
should
be
able
to
detect
it
with
one
of
my
five
senses
this
is
very
much
an
english
stout
as
its
a
bit
too
intense
for
a
milk
or
sweet
stout
and
is
wreaked
with
kilned
malts
drink
it
ice
cold
because
as
it
warms
up
its
flaws
become
glaringly
clear
its
basically
very
burnt
and
charred
mixing
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
dirt
and
hop
its
decent
but
not
outstanding
overall
a
solid
stout
beer
very
drinkable
i
would
have
it
again
pitch
black
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
like
roasted
malt
and
coffee
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
a
little
bit
chocolate
has
a
medium
mouth
feel
more
light
than
it
is
full
o
solid
beer
probably
wont
have
again
though
overall
i
remembered
not
being
very
impressed
with
this
last
time
true
its
not
the
smoothest
richest
most
flavorful
oatmeal
stout
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
fairly
subtle
flavors
and
its
pretty
drinkable
dark
pour
decent
taste
not
bad
not
amazing
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
well
crafted
oatmeal
stout
nothing
spectacular
but
a
very
solid
beer
certainly
worth
a
drink
dark

malt
some
cocoa
subtle
charred
bark
and
root
beer
leather
and
roast
in
the
finish
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
tingly
i
expected
more
body
its
tannic
and
woody
and
talcy
at
the
same
time
seems
to
straddle
the
dry
stout
style
drinkable
but
off
style
v
medium
ryan
initial
taste
ok
terrible
bitter
smokey
aftertaste
chocolate
flavor
absent
would
not
drink
again
this
was
a
christmas
present
for
2014
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
oatmeal
stouts
to
compare
with
but
tasty
nonetheless
easier
to
drink
than
similar
beers
addictively
so
one
of
my
very
first
oatmeal
stouts
very
dark
coffee
smell
but
not
over
powering
for
me
the
finish
was
dry
and
that
is
how
i
like
it
it
has
a
low
abv
4
95
for
a
stout
but
is
perfect
if
you
want
a
light
oatmeal
stout
the
burnt
dark
chocolate
is
my
favorite
note
in
this
beer
very
solid
stout
not
very
complex
but
tasty
granted
this
is
from
the
tap
at
their
brewery
so
out
of
the
bottle
it
could
be
disappointing
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
really
liked
this
most
stouts
i
try
end
up
being
to
sweet
for
me
this
one
was
prefect
great
dry
after
taste
nice
malty
heft
with
some
raisin
and
pumpernickel
flavors
some
dark
chocolate
but
not
really
sweet
i
think
this
is
very
good
american
stout
brecks
stout
is
pretty
good
though
its
not
my
very
favorite
beer
of
theirs
the
oatmeal
base
adds
a
nice
flavor
thats
a
little
different
than
a
milk
stout
and
its
not
quite
as
midnight
black
colored
but
its
tasty
very
low
alcohol
for
this
style
which
means
you
can
have
a
few
if
you
want
without
too
much
trouble
definitely
smooth
and
very
drinkable
notes
very
drinkable
smooth
and
very
drinkable
good
low
abv
stout
not
too
killer
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
im
liking
it
at
just
under
5
itd
be
an
excellent
stout
to
session
on
a
cool
fall
evening
or
in
the
winter
while
shoveling
or
blowing
the
snow
well
worth
trying
creamy
sweetness
upon
first
wash
of
the
palate
slight
bitterness
more
prevalent
at
tip
and
along
back
of
tongue
as
it
warms
and
you
drink
more
of
it
a
bit
thinner
than
anticipated
fantastic
with
grilled
sausage
overall
a
nice
offering
in
the
oatmeal
variety
very
nice
to
see
these
ales
making
a
comeback
personal
favorites
this
is
a
wonderfully
opaque
black
beer
with
a
dark
tan
head
there
ends
the
good
points
smells
of
soy
sauce
mushroom
green
apples
sausage
and
brown
rice
tastes
like
soy
sauce
mushroom
oatmeal
sausage
and
brown
rice
the
apple
smell
does
not
become
an
apple
taste
kind
of
thin
feel
almost
overwhelming
bitterness
and
acridness
o
this
seems
like
a
miss
the
flavor
is
off
and
the
mouthfeel
is
not
what
id
expect
on
an
oatmeal
stout
still
all
things
considered
this
is
still
a
good
enough
beer
to
recommend
a
try
keep
your
expectations
at
a
moderate
level
and
you
should
like
it
just
fine
onothing
offensive
about
this
one
easy
drinker
but
missing
some
of
the
body
and
bigger
roasty
flavors
i
might
expect
o
not
horrible
but
i
would
not
buy
another
one
disappointing

all
around
good

of
darkroast

and
moderate

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
rather
nice
tasty
stout
that
is
on
the
lower
adb
side
a
good
session
style
stout
that
packs
lots
of
flavor
and
body
even
when
not
nitrogen
poured
very
drinkable
not
over
done
in
any
area
nice
beer
overall
very
nice
stout
not
as
strong
as
some
imperial
stouts
but
i
enjoyed
the
combination
of
hops
and
malts
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
i
bought
a
6pack
of
this
beer
and
it
is
definitely
a
stout
i
will
buy
again
overall
theres
a
million
others
that
are
better
the
astringent
coffee
just
puts
the
whole
beer
off
pours
a
dark

head
is
light

chunky

nice
cascading
effect
smell
is
of
roasted
cocoa
and
oats
chewy
taste
smoke
dry
cocoa
bit
of
charcoal
but
feels
underdeveloped
feel
is
quite
thin
for
a
stout
decent
but
not
much
more
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
although
it
feels
a
bit
watery
the
roasted
aspect
of
it
makes
up
for
it
the
smell
is
a
solid
combination
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
just
about
the
same
except
that
youre
hit
with
tang
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
i
would
probably
get
this
again
overall
drinkability
unique
flavors
make
this
worth
a
try
o
eh
o
a
little
much
actually
im
all
for
bold
roasty
beers
but
this
is
like
being
beaten
over
the
head
with
a
blunt
object
overstated
in
the
roasted
malt
department
and
average
in
every
other
way
i
was
expecting
since
its
an
oatmeal
stout
a
more
fuller
feel
it
drinks
dry
and
bitter
at
the
end
im
thinking
export
stout
here
it
is
good
though
o
excellent
oatmeal
stout
i
will
pick
this
up
again
easily
summary
good
my
first
oatmeal
stout
seems
to
be
the
roasted
and
somewhat
bitter
cousin
of
the
milk
stout
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
slight
head
slight
lacing
coffee
wood
and
dark
chocolate
bitter
and
pungent
and
roasty
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
pours
almost
black
in
color
tiny
bit
of
a
brown
head
that
dissipated
quickly
no
head
when
i
started
drinking
smells
of
chocolate
nuttiness
taste
is
fantastic
very
smooth
i
did
not
smell
much
coffee
but
it
has
a
bit
of
a
coffee
flavor
along
with
chocolate
there
is
a
tiny
bitterness
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
near
the
end
very
impressive
well
balanced
stout
a
must
try
o
this
oatmeal
stout
comes
across
as
a
decent
and
very
much
within
expectations
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
but
still
enjoyable
overall
a
good
session
stout
easy
drinking
but
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
think
it
does
have
potential
for
improvement
with
altering
of
the
recipe
specifically
the
oatmeal
and
chocolate
ingredients
o
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
the
style
but
not
anything
that
i
would
keep
going
back
to
either
good
beer
but
that
is
all
it
can
claim
in
my
view
o
a
passable
beer
but
thin
for
the
style
both
in
terms
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
in
the
end
this
one
is
not
one
which
is
worth
the
calorie
count
overall
a
well
done
oatmeal
stout
solid
creaminess
with
a
touch
of
stout
roast
and
chocolate
i
will
certainly
buy
another
sixer
of
this
one
there
arent
many
oatmeal
dry
irish
or
coffee
stouts
to
be
found
around
here
at
least
not
real
close
and
i
like
to
keep
a
moderate
abv
stout
on
hand
when
i
can
o
overall
this
is
decent
but
nothing
memorable
id
certainly
drink
another
one
if
it
was
nearby
but
this
isnt
a
stout
that
i
would
purchase
regularly
its
a
tough
market
with
so
many
flavorful
dark
beers
out
there
and
this
one
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
d
overall
good
but
only
at
the
right
price
not
worth
driving
too
far
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malts
dark
coffee
espresso
beans
bitter
grassy
hops
minerals
bigger
dark
roasted
than
sweet
malt
flavor
and
not
that
big
in
body
overall
but
tasty
for
its
style
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
what
a
stout
should
taste
like
a
nice
nutty
deep
roast
coffee
and
slight
caramel
are
balanced
nicely
with
a
slight
spicy
hop
characteristic
i
am
not
sure
what
the
oatmeal
brings
to
this
perhaps
a
more
mealy
type
of
malt
taste
i
am
not
sure
however
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
headed
into
this
but
its
a
decently
smooth
stout
has
some
nice
flavors
if
youre
looking
for
a
reasonably
priced
stout
to
go
to
its
not
a
bad
choice
o
ive
been
pleased
w
beckenridges
full
offering
except
the
terrible
vinalla
porter
yuk
two
words
either
easy
drinkin
or
goes
flat
o
very
standard
for
a
craft
beer
somewhat
disappointing
ive
found
better
quality
at
a
similar
price
point
a
decent
tasting
oatmeal
stout
something
i
certainly
can
see
myself
drinking
again
and
several
at
a
time
at
that
however
it
just
doesnt
taste
or
feel
like
an
oatmeal
stout
and
so
the
scores
reflect
that
at
under
5
alcohol
it
wouldnt
make
much
of
a
winter
warmer
but
its
a
perfect
apresski
beer
in
breck
and
a
nice
roasty
stout
for
any
other
occasion
ocould
have
used
a
bit
more
creaminess
but
still
had
great
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
stout
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
while
not
a
big
flavor
it
was
pleasant
to
drink
and
strangely
refreshing
halfway
decent
chocolatecoffee
flavor
with
some
mild
malt
roastiness
liked
the
sweetness
good
beer
very
drinkable
but
nothing
exceptional
a
very
impressive
oatmeal
stout
one
that
id
buy
six
at
a
time
in
the
future
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
fresh
cocoa
powder
taste
begins
with
some
coffee
then
a
bit
of
dark
caramel
then
some
molasses
then
some
earthy
citrusy
hops
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
that
i
would
get
again
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
prickly
carbonation
this
was
an
ok
offering
that
sort
of
missed
the
mark
the
cola
aspect
was
weird
and
it
missed
on
the
expected
oatmeal
inclusion
in
both
flavor
and
feel
its
not
a
beer
i
would
purchase
again
o
the
superb
taste
of
this
beer
outweighs
its
deviation
from
the
expected
oatmeal
stout
style
this
is
the
second
breckenridge
brewery
beer
ive
sampled
summerbright
ale
being
the
other
and
ive
found
both
to
have
superior
taste
and
drinkability
breckenridge
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
even
with
its
shortcomings
this
is
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
and
an
excellent
session
beer
this
is
kind
of
just
there
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
saw
it
but
it
wont
call
my
name
if
you
know
what
i
mean
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
it
is
really
like
coffee
with
alcohol
in
the
flavoring
it
is
less
like
beer
and
more
like
the
cold
coffee
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
except
for
the
feel
i
think
the
carbonation
takes
away
from
what
the
oats
are
there
for
which
is
a
smoother
body
not
bad
aside
from
that
certainly
nowhere
near
fbs
but
this
is
a
nice
little
substitute
if
there
is
none
left
or
it
isnt
distributed
in
your
area
overall
i
can
sum
this
beer
up
in
just
a
few
words
good
not
great
nothing
stands
out
about
it
at
all
would
i
drink
it
again
for
free
sure
would
i
buy
it
probably
not
overall
this
was
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
not
my
all
time
favorite
but
not
bad
either
oenjoyable
and
easy
drinking
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
would
certainly
drink
this
again
overall
not
satisfied
at
all
but
i
will
try
this
again
if
i
find
a
fresh
one
again
i
think
this
is
the
liquor
stores
negligence
and
not
the
brewerys
fault
o
very
good
beer
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
still
delicious
if
i
could
id
like
to
taste
a
little
more
sweetness
because
then
it
may
become
my
favorite
stout
still
its
a
great
one
o
pretty
tasty
the
roastyness
was
a
little
surprising
after
the
aromas
was
much
sweeter
still
a
very
nice
combination
of
mostly
roasty
and
some
sweet
flavors
quite
drinkable
too
average
stout
missed
the
mark
on
the
texturemouthfeel
overall
a
reasonably
decent
oatmeal
stout
fairly
standard
its
not
incredibly
flavorful
or
unique
but
its
highly
sessionable
at
4
9
abv
balanced
well
with
bitterness
and
sweetness
just
nothing
exciting
going
on
really
a
little
above
average
id
say
but
not
much
to
see
here
o
like
i
said
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
this
is
one
beer
that
breck
absolutely
nails
overall
this
beer
looks
and
smells
more
promising
than
its
taste
which
is
fairly
undistinguished
but
it
still
beats
water
this
stout
is
a
classic
in
my
book
it
has
all
the
characteristics
that
i
desire
in
a
stout
tasty
and
robust
this
is
really
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
its
rich
without
being
too
much
a
great
example
of
a
below
5
beer
with
mounds
of
flavor
two
tongues
up
pours
dark
with
medium
head
roasty
chocolate
aroma
some
sweetness
flavor
follows
with
big
chocolate
notes
some
nice
roast
and
mild
coffee
does
not
finish
with
much
bitter
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
pretty
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
found
this
to
be
a
very
nice
stout
overall
nicely
done
but
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
a
pleasant
inoffensive
and
fairly
tasty
stout
could
be
heartier
but
as
it
is
its
a
nice
easy
drinker
fortunately
or
unfortunately
its
one
of
the
few
shelf
stouts
available
in
the
area
ive
picked
it
up
before
and
ill
do
so
again
final
thoughts
if
this
was
on
nitrotap
id
prefer
it
to
a
guinness
just
for
the
oatmeal
quality
while
its
not
the
best
of
the
style
its
definitely
a
good
beer
i
applaud
any
beer
that
can
achieve
this
level
of
enjoyment
while
retaining
an
abv
under
5
o
pretty
damn
good
oatmeal
stout
aroma
of
roasted
dark
malts
includes
a
backbone
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavour
blends
these
elements
adding
some
oak
tannins
and
a
nicely
dry
finish
that
lingers
for
a
decent
length
of
time
nice
transition
in
the
taste
from
sweet
to
bitter
o
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
drank
but
definitely
a
good
one
would
be
happy
to
drink
more
of
these
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
faint
ruby
tones
under
light
theres
a
thin
tan
head
and
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
of
cocoa
coffee
and
a
hint
of
wood
the
flavor
has
oatmeal
with
maple
syrup
notes
with
dark
chocolate
toast
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
show
through
more
as
it
warms
its
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
pleasant
warmth
breckengridge
oatmeal
stout
is
a
good
brew
recommended
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
tasting
before
bedtime
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
flavor
if
you
are
new
to
oatmeal
stout
or
experienced
in
the
brand
this
is
a
definite
go
to
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
and
have
tried
several
other
breweries
before
this
one
i
must
say
i
was
not
impressed
with
it
i
think
it
is
an
okay
beer
to
drink
but
would
recommend
other
options
of
oatmeal
stout
out
there
before
this
one
i
have
heard
good
things
about
breckenridge
this
type
of
one
from
them
is
simply
not
for
me
beautiful
deep
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
hues
nicely
lacing
head
much
roastier
and
robust
than
expected
lots
of
cream
coffee
almost
burnt
toast
and
sweetness
of
caramel
with
a
bit
of
breadiness
so
smooth
i
highly
recommend
this
underrated
oatmeal
stout
o
not
many
intangibles
to
speak
of
but
the
flavors
are
amazing
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
think
ice
cream
and
caramel
mmmm
overall
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
when
your
watching
tv
or
playing
some
xbox
im
not
sure
what
you
could
match
it
with
but
it
is
great
on
its
own
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
nice
medium
to
heavy
carbonation
not
bad
as
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
quite
tasty
maybe
enhanced
by
the
rains
and
lower
than
normal
temperature
outside
o
maybe
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
better
coming
from
breckenridge
as
they
make
decent
beer
but
this
is
an
average
stout
nothing
more
nothing
less
overall
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
when
your
watching
tv
or
playing
some
xbox
im
not
sure
what
you
could
match
it
with
but
it
is
great
on
its
own
o
a
nice
stout
good
blend
of
chocolate
and
coffee
without
being
too
much
body
is
medium
to
mediumlight
with
a
slight
bit
of
wateriness
around
the
edges
no
real
faults
for
a
beer
with
this
low
of
an
ethanol
content
carbonation
is
noticeable
but
fairly
low
appropriate
for
the
lighter
body
resultant
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mildly
creamy
appropriate
for
the
style
finish
is
quite
dry
overall
id
say
pretty
solid
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
id
definitely
drink
again
its
a
good
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
very
complex
good
for
those
who
may
not
know
about
them
or
want
something
mindboggling
okay
so
im
kind
of
biased
since
oatmeal
stouts
are
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
is
an
awesome
brew
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
almost
black
looking
you
cant
see
thru
the
glass
and
for
dark
beer
drinkers
thats
always
a
good
sign
lol
a
night
light
lacey
cream
head
to
it
very
small
maybe
quarter
inch
has
a
pleasant
smell
kind
of
sweet
but
you
can
smell
those
nice
dark
malts
very
easy
to
drink
extremely
smooth
for
a
dark
style
beer
a
nice
balanced
hop
taste
at
first
sip
then
you
start
tasting
all
the
toasted
malt
flavor
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
overall
this
is
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
at
under
5
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
well
recommended
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
borders
on
being
more
than
sippable
the
body
is
full
and
robust
allowing
the
flavors
to
really
hit
the
palate
while
never
becoming
sticky
or
coating
the
carbonation
is
barely
noticeable
but
does
a
great
job
in
helping
to
move
this
beer
over
the
tongue
and
down
the
throat
bottle
pint
glass
o
good
beer
nothing
really
pops
for
me
but
thats
ok
everything
mingles
together
nicely
in
this
beer
definitely
worth
a
taste
overall
im
glad
i
took
my
time
with
this
one
dead
cold
i
disliked
this
a
bit
warmer
and
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
decent
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
a
pretty
good
version
it
feels
a
bit
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
medium
bodied
a
little
watery
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
is
a
little
off
putting
but
its
better
than
any
other
offering
ive
had
from
breck
taste
is
bitter
and
dry
with
a
sharp
and
coffee
like
finish
that
lingers
for
a
while
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
overly
carbonated
for
me
overall
its
decent
but
not
special
otherwise
this
overly
roasty
stout
will
always
be
a
let
down
however
if
breckenridge
does
ever
change
the
flavors
of
this
stout
i
will
gladly
return
to
it
overall
a
good
beer
with
some
flaws
o
overall
its
definitely
missing
the
body
and
creaminess
and
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
robust
for
me
may
be
right
up
someone
elses
alley
its
alright

overall
i
have
found
another
beer
i
really
enjoy
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
it
reminds
me
of
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
if
you
like
porters
or
stouts
this
will
trip
your
trigger
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
its
hard
to
find
one
that
i
dont
like
and
the
abv
is
where
it
should
be
for
this
style
dark
roasted
malts
make
for
a
background
and
let
coffee
flavors
and
a
somewhat
sweet
milkiness
spice
them
up
hops
add
a
bitterness
in
the
back
that
is
welcome
to
the
style
as
the
malts
are
not
quite
as
fierce
as
they
could
be
but
then
again
it
is
a
pretty
light
abv
beer
so
it
makes
sense
but
still
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
from
the
malts
not
the
booze
would
have
accentuated
some
very
nice
flavors
here
instead
of
having
a
lightmedium
bodied
beer
that
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
a
prickly
mouthfeel
in
the
middle
moves
to
a
dry
more
effervescent
finish
aided
by
the
balancing
hops
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
pretty
solid
beer
here
not
the
most
complex
stout
in
the
world
it
has
a
lot
of
charcoal
flavor
and
not
much
else
its
good
i
recommend
it
and
i
will
have
another
however
i
wouldt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
o
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
this
isnt
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
i
did
like
the
rogue
much
more
aromas
include
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
overall
enjoyable
because
its
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
order
it
on
tap
if
i
saw
it
somewhere
but
there
are
a
lot
of
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
while
not
bad
its
not
great
middle
of
the
road
decent
and
drinkable
but
not
chewy
enough
for
an
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
beautiful
black
with
a
twofingered
sized
creamy
tan
head
there
was
an
artificial
sweetness
smell
that
was
kind
of
offputting
roasted
oats
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
toffee
the
taste
was
pleasing
but
its
really
the
feel
of
this
beer
that
sets
it
off
out
of
the
bottle
it
taste
like
a
creamy
draught
kind
of
dry
and
just
enough
carbonation
very
onpoint
and
true
to
the
style
of
an
oatmeal
stout
last
beer
for
the
night
is
a
breckenridge
oatmeal
stout
whilst
wrapping
gifts
for
my
hellions
the
beer
pours
dark
opaque
with
thin
ecru
head
that
is
not
leaving
a
very
good
lace
the
smell
is
mostly
roast
teh
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
hints
of
roast
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
to
light
body
with
good
carbontaion
overall
it
is
a
decent
stout
but
not
out
of
this
world
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
smooth
and
creamy
breckenridge
brewery
oatmeal
stout
if
you
have
read
my
other
stout
reviews
you
know
that
american
style
stouts
are
just
a
bit
too
much
beer
for
me
still
i
am
cycling
through
a
few
stouts
this
month
as
a
learning
experience
the
breckenridge
oatmeal
stout
is
black
no
surprise
here
but
the
head
was
really
thin
as
was
the
aroma
flavor
was
a
meaty
roast
malt
up
front
with
some
bitter
coming
on
near
the
end
there
is
a
lot
of
beer
here
be
warned
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
drink
two
but
this
is
the
case
for
any
american
style
stout
overall
the
breckenridge
offering
is
on
par
with
other
american
stouts
i
have
tried
overall
a
fullbodied
beer
deep
chocolatey
flavors
that
keep
the
beer
interesting
the
label
does
deliver
it
is
very
smooth
going
down
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
an
extremely
dark
bloodred
and
ruby
coloring
with
a
thin
spaced
bubble
light
brown
head
that
coats
the
glass
nose
of
milk
chocolate
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
bitter
dark
coffee
creamy
smooth
body
with
flavors
of
dark
roasted
coffee
bittersweet
cocoa
nibs
and
a
good
roasted
feel
the
beer
has
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
smooth
initial
finish
and
a
slight
linger
to
the
sweet
characteristics
tasty
stout
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
some
improvements
could
be
made
in
my
opinion
see
above
comments
did
enjoy
and
always
appreciate
a
beer
thats
low
in
alcohol
that
has
flavor
overall
this
was
a
tasty
beer
to
have
on
tap
but
i
wouldnt
go
running
out
the
door
to
pick
up
a
6
pack
more
body
and
mouthfeel
are
my
only
complaints
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brownish
black
color
with
a
decent
brown
colored
head
that
faded
away
rapidly
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
rich
with
burnt
roasted
aromas
giving
a
light
impression
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
heavily
roasted
as
well
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
in
the
way
of
transition
from
start
to
finish
though
its
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
overall
this
beer
was
decent
in
my
opinion
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
pours
a
twofinger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
some
lace
deep
brown
color
no
highlights
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
roasted
coffee
and
flavor
is
roasted

burnt

westborough
ma
o
a
really
great
stout
but
not
a
lot
of
oatmealness
to
it
i
really
like
the
lower
alcohol
also
as
i
could
suck
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
pours
a
dark
chalky
black
with
minimal
cap
of
tan
dense
froth
scent
is
of
roasted
grains
with
a
mild
sweet
chocolate
note
and
the
faintest
hint
of
dark
fruit
taste
focuses
on
the
roasted
grain
with
solid
chocolate
notes
mild
milky
sweetness
body
is
disappointing
as
oatmeal
stouts
are
supposed
to
be
creamy
and
not
watery
overall
this
beer
drinks
like
a
porter
in
scent
taste
and
body
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
with
a
complexity
of
smells
and
taste
however
the
mouthfeel
seems
thin
for
a
porter
let
alone
a
stout
i
would
still
recommend
giving
it
a
try
though
thin
and
astringent
deep
roasty
flavor
though
lingering
flavors
of
bitter
unsweetened
bakers
chocolate
dark
roast
cafe
mocha
graphite
the
light
body
needs
some
improvement
though
the
flavors
are
approaching
a
bold
level
not
a
bad
introductory
stout
but
it
really
left
me
wanting
more
o
its
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
only
5
percent
alcohol
its
got
some
pretty
kickin
flavors
overall
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
not
one
that
blows
me
away
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
oatmeal
stouts
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
i
appreciate
when
oatmeal
stouts
incorporate
some
bitterness
into
their
flavor
profile
while
also
enjoying
that
others
dont
breckenridge
brewery
did
a
good
job
with
that
on
this
one
while
also
capturing
the
roastiness
and
sweet
oatiness
i
seek
in
the
style
the
thinness
of
this
is
a
bit
of
a
buzzkill
and
does
limit
its
potential
overall
its
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
wont
be
confused
with
the
bests
of
the
style
overall
this
is
my
favourite
oatmeal
stout
hands
down
this
beer
really
has
everything
i
ask
for
a
great
appearance
great
taste
easy
to
drink
and
low
abv
this
beer
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
fullbodied
smooth
light
carbonation
nothing
mindblowing
but
its
damn
good
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
recommend
it
overall
a
solid
very
accessible
stout
thinness
translates
to
drinkability
in
this
case
its
not
heavy
its
not
a
tongue
punch
of
bitterness
its
a
very
quaffable
sweetened
coffee
kind
of
stout
good
for
kicking
off
a
session
so
after
my
last
run
in
with
breckenridge
their
vanilla
porter
with
which
i
was
quite
disappointed
this
was
the
beer
i
must
have
been
remembering
when
i
said
i
liked
their
stuff
this
isnt
a
lifechanging
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
well
worth
picking
up
and
trying
some
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
check
it
out
if
youre
looking
for
something
dark
its
pretty
good
an
absolutely
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
rich
burnt
black
with
mocha
fluff
on
top
a
full
inch
thick
smells
of
sticky
dark
malts
unrefined
primitive
sugars
and
booze
mouthfeel
is
a
little
tiny
bit
thin
a
heavier
vibe
would
bode
well
for
this
one
when
its
dark
out
at
430pm
taste
is
roasted
malts
toasted
dry
oatmeal
and
a
cold
bitter
strong
coffee
finish
all
of
a
sudden
its
gone
a
perfectly
satisfactory
representation
of
elegance
and
precision
this
is
breckenridge
brewerys
best
beer
by
a
mile
tastes
like
it
smells
with
the
addition
of
charcoal
as
a
lingering
yet
acceptable
aftertaste
damn
drinkable
great
body
thick
rich
full
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
this
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
light
able
to
penetrate
the
edges
there
is
a
nice
mocha
head
with
large
bubbles
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
oats
bread
and
a
little
chocolate
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
a
little
light
but
not
bad
a
little
more
bread
than
roasted
malts
and
oats
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
prefer
d
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
thats
widely
available
at
least
here
in
colorado
certainly
a
good
choice
overall
i
enjoyed
this
oatmeal
stout
and
would
get
another
one
in
the
near
future
whether
here
in
mass
or
out
in
colorado
when
i
go
there
in
december
easy
drinking
and
has
simple
quality
tastes
that
make
this
a
well
rounded
beer
overall
decent
id
have
it
if
available
but
others
out
there
are
prefereable
for
a
stout
sam
smith
in
particular
is
a
favorite
not
bad
drinkability
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
i
could
have
several
of
these
this
is
one
of
breckinridges
better
beers
o
i
bought
this
for
being
cheaper
than
most
stouts
i
drink
and
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
keep
on
hand
when
i
dont
want
to
reach
for
the
expensive
stuff
its
a
simple
but
enjoyable
stout
and
i
think
it
fits
the
bill
nicely
pours
out
very
dark
brown
in
color
the
head
is
tan
and
disappears
quickly
see
just
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
coffee
not
getting
much
of
anything
else
taste
is
bitter
sweet
getting
a
good
amount
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
coffee
is
present
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
average
pretty
smooth
and
a
bit
lite
carbonation
is
higher
than
usual
average
oatmeal
stout
good
but
not
great
i
dont
think
i
would
go
after
this
again
o
i
wrote
this
brewery
off
after
the
471
iipa
but
this
may
have
got
them
back
in
my
good
graces
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
very
easy
going
stout
not
many
bad
things
to
point
out
here
just
a
simple
everyday
kind
of
beer
o
i
find
myself
disappointed
by
this
one
it
looked
good
it
smelled
good
and
then
it
hit
my
lips
and
just
fell
flat
id
pass
on
it
o
great
oatmeal
stout
a
very
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
day
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
ever
had
overall
a
good
stout
prob
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
while
writing
this
review
i
keep
going
back
to
the
glass
for
more
smell
and
taste
and
i
just
notice
that
this
is
easily
more
than
half
empty
now
i
am
quite
enjoying
this
stout
and
will
have
to
keep
this
on
the
list
to
watch
for
in
the
stores
this
came
from
a
breckenridge
sample
pack
that
was
on
sale
12
oz
bottle
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
deep
brownishblack
with
quickly
dissapating
one
finger
head
but
decent
lacing
smell
of
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
burnt
toffee
coffee
seems
to
be
the
dominating
taste
a
bit
acrid
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
nice
and
smooth
overall
a
solid
brew
but
less
than
world
class
the
mouthfeel
is
where
i
fall
in
love
with
oatmeal
stouts
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
nice
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
for
its
intent
as
an
oatmeal
stout
it
is
rather
subdued
but
for
a
stout
in
general
it
is
satisfactory
od
highly
drinkable
goes
down
smoothly
no
objections
to
having
a
few
in
a
row
poured
opaque
black
like
a
stout
with
a
small
cap
of
creamy
khaki
head
scents
of
dark
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
oats
and
grains
roasty
taste
dark
malts
dark
chocolate
dark
coffee
and
a
touch
of
smoke
not
much
else
to
say
pretty
basic
and
pretty
good
fullbodied
smooth
and
a
quite
drinkable
stout
overall
orevisit
it
again
probably
its
a
decent
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
i
liked
that
it
was
smooth
and
all
the
flavors
blended
together
very
well
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
mostly
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
very
thin
light
brown
head
the
little
head
there
was
did
leave
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
reminded
me
more
of
a
coffee
stout
than
an
oatmeal
large
amount
of
chocolate
medium
amount
of
coffee
with
a
smaller
amount
of
grains
a
very
small
amount
of
alcohol
could
be
smelled
taste
was
slightly
milky
at
times
was
sweet
and
other
times
was
a
bit
bitter
grains
could
definitely
be
tasted
on
the
tongue
if
allowed
to
linger
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
but
carbonation
was
off
was
too
light
in
the
main
sip
but
over
powering
as
it
left
the
mouth
overall
a
reasonable
stout
the
after
tingling
of
the
carbonation
throws
me
for
a
loop
and
knocks
it
down
a
few
pegs
definitely
worth
a
try
for
any
oatmeal
stout
lover
o
light
smooth
and
very
drinkable
low
abv
rich
and
tasty
solid
oatmeal
stout
overall
the
beer
was
okay
there
was
just
not
much
too
it
after
the
first
taste
i
intend
to
come
back
to
this
when
i
want
a
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
it
is
hitting
th
spot
right
now
overall
it
wasnt
bad
ive
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
but
it
was
enjoyable
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
o
nice
flavor
balance
sweet
at
the
start
and
bitter
at
the
end
wasnt
quite
as
delicious
as
it
smells
and
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
unimpressive
another
good
beer
from
breckenridge
its
not
quite
great
but
this
is
something
all
dark
beer
drinkers
should
keep
on
hand
t
its
a
nice
flavour
is
not
so
heavy
kind
of
sweet
well
balanced
the
toast
flavour
is
nice
the
flavour
is
good
but
not
exceptional
i
like
the
flavor
but
not
the
consistency
pours
black
like
oil
nice
brown
fluffy
head
to
it
not
too
much
aroma
to
it
taste
is
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
chocolate
and
coffee
tasting
notes
come
through
finishes
nice
and
clean
a
little
too
weak
on
the
taste
it
doesnt
stay
on
the
taste
buds
too
long
but
the
creaminess
makes
up
for
it
and
gives
it
some
great
drinkability
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
out
there
but
a
very
solid
one
at
least
o
overall
interesting
complexity
a
bit
sweet
but
has
a
smooth
easy
roastiness
that
goes
down
fairly
well
enough
ogreat
beer
to
have
every
now
an
again
to
change
things
up
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
dark
tan
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
thick
broken
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
oats
dark
malt
and
cookie
dough
taste
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
smell
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
i
would
get
again
a
pretty
standard
oatmeal
stout
though
with
enough
flavor
to
put
it
above
average
been
meaning
to
try
this
beer
for
some
time
now
and
today
is
the
day
get
some
it
pours
a
bleakly
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamy
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
wheat
toasted
oats
light
roasted
malts
and
light
chocolate
powder
i
gotta
admit
though
it
sounds
mild
its
still
pretty
pleasant
and
effective
the
same
unfortunately
cannot
be
said
of
the
taste
which
is
overwhelmingly
of
charred
oats
with
some
chocolate
powder
mild
coffee
and
black
pepper
being
neglected
in
some
flavor
basement
that
isnt
to
say
things
taste
bad
just
not
as
good
as
they
smell
the
body
is
a
lightfeeling
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
smooth
feel
overall
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
not
a
particularly
noteworthy
one
but
definitely
nice
enough
to
drink
fairly
happily
o
mediocre
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
stouts
out
there
its
got
the
smoothness
of
oatmeal
but
no
body
other
than
that
the
flavor
is
fine
but
ive
had
much
better
in
the
style
great
bottle
art
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
with
a
nice
balanced
flavor
a
few
of
these
can
easily
be
consumed
in
a
session
buy
this
o
overall
this
is
a
great
contendor
in
its
class
and
style
probably
goes
well
with
charcoal
broiled
steak
also
pepperhot
omelets
for
breakfast
or
dinner
grilled
burger
with
mushrooms
also
sounds
great
ojust
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
it
would
be
good
if
i
did
not
have
to
wait
till
gabf
to
get
it
overall
this
beer
was
a
huge
surprise
to
me
after
drinking
their
vanilla
porter
earlier
in
the
day
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
i
gave
the
porter
a
c
very
solid
beer
would
drink
without
hesitation
like
i
said
it
tries
to
emulate
samuel
smith
and
does
a
decent
job
scoring
just
a
bit
lower
in
each
category
overall
decent
american
stout
that
includes
a
nice
array
of
flavors
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
wouldnt
recommend
getting
a
6
of
it
o
overall
another
great
beer
from
breckenridge
i
have
never
been
disappointed
with
this
brewery
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
this
is
one
fine
stout
i
like
the
espresso
and
rich
chocolate
smell
tastefully
good
as
well
with
the
same
taste
of
chocolate
milk
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
lots
of
malt
i
could
have
this
one
for
breakfast
lunchand
dinner
what
ya
mean
im
a
raging
alcholic
i
beg
your
pardon
this
is
one
tasty
beverageone
that
will
put
a
smile
on
your
face
all
day
long
overall
creamy
stout
that
needs
a
little
more
flavor
in
my
opinion
o
deliciously
roasty
overall
very
tasty
definitely
worth
a
second
buy
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
an
ideal
and
faithful
representation
of
an
oatmeal
stout
superb
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
have
had
much
better
oatmeal
stouts
poured
very
dark
with
a
smell
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
really
not
that
pleasant
rather
strong
taste
for
only
being
4
95
abv
all
around
just
an
average
beer
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
needs
more
sweet
flavors
to
balance
nonetheless
it
is
drinkable
and
does
have
a
descent
roasted
character
overall
reminded
me
a
bit
of
the
crabtree
version
pretty
bland
with
some
off
notes
the
sweetness
and
char
didnt
mix
well
osmooth
drinking
and
tasty
stout
it
does
not
wow
but
it
is
pretty
good
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
pours
slightly
darker
than
cola
with
a
one
inch
tight
mochacolored
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
consistent
soapy
skim
with
delicate
strands
of
lacing
encircling
the
edges
of
the
glass
nose
is
rather
subdued
but
a
suggestion
of
cocoa
roast
and
oats
comes
out
in
the
mix
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
theres
also
a
slight
artificial
sweetener
character
interspersed
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
lively
and
a
slightly
creamy
texture
all
and
all
a
pretty
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
and
quite
flavorful
for
the
abv
id
like
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
on
nitro
if
possible
d
easy
to
drink
good
beer
not
in
same
class
as
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
but
pretty
good
o
an
amazingly
full
flavored
small
stout
i
wonder
if
the
bottles
are
as
good
whats
surprising
about
this
beer
is
its
modest
abv
with
some
of
the
substantial
characteristics
of
a
stout
with
a
more
robust
abv
the
beer
is
fairly
full
bodied
and
there
seems
to
be
a
touch
of
booziness
in
the
sweetish
roasted
malts
underneath
i
would
have
pegged
this
for
a
beer
with
a
much
higher
alcohol
content
it
pours
a
fairly
thick
inky
black
color
not
much
head
or
lace
the
beer
is
very
deep
roasted
and
has
some
charred
notes
but
also
some
sweeter
roasted
notes
below
the
beer
is
creamy
and
a
bit
oily
on
the
tongue
and
maybe
has
a
touch
of
a
metallic
flavor
to
it
there
are
some
molasses
chocolate
notes
here
as
well
this
is
a
decent
stout
the
bittering
hops
do
make
an
appearance
and
the
beer
is
quite
substantial
i
like
it
but
its
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
an
above
average
oatmeal
stout
but
my
main
gripe
is
that
it
seems
a
bit
carbonated
and
the
flavors
while
there
leave
me
wanting
something
a
bit
more
robust
easy
drinking
and
tasty
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
a
grittylooking
tan
head
patches
up
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
re
oaty
and
has
mildly
roasted
coffee
aromas
taste
is
also
gritty
like
the
look
plenty
of
oats
and
sweetness
a
bit
of
alcohol
feel
some
bitterness
afterward
nice
an
almost
rudimentary
stout
but
thats
good
o
decent
representation
of
the
style
nothing
more
than
average
its
a
good
oatmeal
stout
would
be
curious
to
try
an
imperial
version
of
this
and
the
same
with
some
age
to
it
a
decent
sixpacker
md
okay
aftertaste
as
it
is
a
bit
thin
low
astringency
overall
drinkable
for
oatmeal
stout
drinkers
give
this
one
a
try
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
that
had
all
the
right
characteristics
and
went
down
rather
smooth
and
easy
jet
black
oily
in
appearance
nice
fluffy

is

too

of
vanilla

roasted

flavors
again
cocoa
with
an
underlying
sense

good

a
great
beer
all
around
and
under
5
abv
i
could
do
this
all
night
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
fairly
standard
but
with
a
nice
robustness
that
goes
well
on
this
chilly
northern
michigan
night
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
choose
this
over
some
of
my
goto
stouts
but
if
you
buy
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed

it
may
be

the

there
is
this
bready
and
dark
maltiness
in
the
taste
with
a
tingling
hopped
ending
it
came
from
a
mixed
12
pack
and
it
was
probably
the
best
one
poured
from

12

a
12

up

at
the
finish
feels
medium

in

overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
another
new
addition
to
the
beer
available
in
nh
pours
a
pretty
solid
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipate
almost
immediately
smells

meh
nothing
really
objectionable
here
but
nothing

either
i
would
drink
one
if
offered
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
seek
another
one
out

a
nice

mediumfull

and
moderate

overall
a
decent
beer
nose
is
quite
light
mirroring
the
flavor
profile
of
chocolate
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
lesser
notes
of
aspirin
menthol
and
citric
hops
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
drinkability
is
definitely
there
very
balanced
and
smooth
doesnt
push
the
envelope
notes
nose
was
great
but
the
rest
just
doesnt
live
up
to
that
expectation
and
is
just
an
average
beer
more
bitter
roasted
acidic
like
flavors
with
coffee
and
chocolate
being
there
body
is
just
too
thin
and
watery
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
but
not
a
great
one
either
i
was
reminded
of
a
loudmouthed
braggart
all
show
but
no
mojo
behind
that
intimidating
beetleblack
color
the
hops
are
too
strong
and
whatever
oatmeal
they
used
didnt
really
smooth
things
out
theres
a
strong
tang
of
vinyl
too
as
if
they
melted
a
few
33s
into
the
vat
the
subdued
roasted
flavor
is
quickly
squashed
by
the
bitterness
a
bit
too
much
sting
in
the
body
too
worth
a
try
but
only
once
drink
is
pretty
good
too
sessionable
creamy
and
rich
a
nice
light
hop
bitterness
the
only
drawbacks
are
the
light
metallic
taste
and
the
sticky
finish
poured
dark
of
course
not
much
head
smells
very
much
of
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
coffee
flavor
very
light
carbonation
tastes
sweet
you
can
definitely
tastes
the
oats
i
felt
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
bitter
very
drinkable
stout
i
will
enjoy
this
one
again
i
dont
like
the
drinkability
rating
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
i
think
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
you
can
maybe
have
2
in
one
night
the
complete
opposite
of
a
light
beer
a
great
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
a
good
beer
to
turn
to
on
a
cold
snowy
day
d
very
drinkable
any
more
sweet
then
no
but
this
is
wellbalanced
and
delicious
thick
and
creamy
with
all
the
right
flavors
there
the
oatmeal
is
background
flavor
while
chocolatecoffee
are
predominant
bitter
hops
bring
balance
to
the
sweetness
i
like
the
bitterness
that
the
hops
bring
but
i
feel
like
more
oatmeal
flavor
would
be
welcome
d
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
would
consider
getting
it
again
looking
for
something
diffrent
glad
i
pick
this
up
a
dark
black
color
pour
like
beer
you
want
to
drink
not
a
over
powering
smell
or
taste
this
beer
is
not
a
pounding
down
beer
but
a
beer
to
drink
and
ejoy
so
pick
some
up
and
its
much
better
then
their
vannila
porter
so
run
to
the
store
and
get
this
md
full
chewy
body
easy
to
drink
tasty
d
not
the
absolute
best
thats
out
there
but
enjoyable
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
and
am
not
disappointed
about
picking
this
up
on
a
whim
d
average
its
a
drier
roasty
oatmeal
stout
not
the
flavors
i
was
hoping
for
not
bad
by
any
means
but
nothing
to
seek
out
or
buy
again
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
for
a
person
wanting
to
experience
one
for
the
first
time
but
far
from
a
horrible
mess
very
generic
on
nitro
and
the
diacety
really
detracts
pretty
much
ho
hum
with
some
flaws
not
something
i
would
recommend
d
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
i
liked
enough
to
get
again
overall
i
really
like
this
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
and
this
fit
the
bill
nicely
drinkability
overall
a
delicious
and
easy
going
oatmeal
stout
that
doesnt
seem
to
give
you
the
bloated
feeling
acompanied
by
msot
stouts
of
this
style
the
only
area
that
this
beer
seems
to
lack
in
is
the
head
which
is
minimal
to
not
present
at
all
a
very
pleasant
straight
forward
oatmeal
stout
offering
no
challenges
enjoyable
but
not
exceptional
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
it
is
very
creamy
as
ive
found
the
oatmeal
to
be
nice
rich
roasted
flavors
with
a
smooth
finish
also
at
4
9
abv
this
could
make
for
a
great
sessioner
great
beer
breckenridge
brewery
pours
a
warm
black
with
a
low
white
uneven
head
that
fell
fast
minimal
lacing
smell
is
very
sweet
almost
intimidatingly
so
full
of
dark
cherry
and
fresh
bread
and
oats
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
underwhelming
mild
carbonation
sort
of
malty
on
the
front
end
with
a
fruittinged
slightly
woody
middle
and
a
mild
gently
bitter
finish
this
gets
the
basics
right
and
its
mellow
enough
to
be
highly
drinkable
im
enjoying
mine
but
theres
not
a
ton
going
on
here
overall
in
regards
to
the
oatmeal
stout
style
generally
samuel
smiths
buffalo
bills
barney
flats
dark
horse
pretty
much
every
other
oatmeal
stout
ive
tried
really
is
as
good
or
better
id
probably
go
with
a
c
but
the
b
that
ba
tallies
the
score
out
as
is
close
enough
wow
this
beer
has
a
great
color
a
beautiful
white
head
frothy
and
thick
the
smell
is
beautifully
sweet
and
perfect
the
taste
is
amazing
and
smooth
the
only
problem
with
this
beer
that
i
have
is
that
its
so
good
that
i
end
up
drinking
a
whole
6
pack
everytime
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
american
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
not
to
mention
that
this
also
fits
into
the
category
of
session
beer
it
would
be
pretty
easy
to
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
along
with
some
oatmeal
raisin
cookies
or
biscotti
and
as
some
have
mentioned
on
here
this
is
a
bit
like
coffee
no
need
to
pour
cream
in
here
though
this
can
be
enjoyed
as
is
and
for
anyone
new
to
this
style
it
doesnt
get
any
more
easygoing
or
introductory
than
this
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
holiday
season
conclusion
i
have
never
been
impressed
by
this
brewery
but
this
beer
is
quite
good
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the
title
and
it
is
very
good
in
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
department
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
samuel
smiths
in
my
opinion
the
champion
in
the
style
but
surprisingly
close
well
done
breckenridge
you
have
partially
redeemed
yourself
with
my
palate
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
as
well
as
some
coffee
oatmeal
caramel
toast
and
hazelnut
slight
lactic
character
that
add
a
silky
creaminess
making
this
beer
extremely
quaffable
complex
and
well
balanced
with
a
dry
finish
i
think
with
some
tweaking
this
beer
could
be
solid
the
flavors
could
have
been
bigger
and
more
pronounced
its
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
drink
not
very
good
felt
again
like
i
was
drinking
coffee
and
since
i
cant
consume
more
than
2
cups
of
coffee
the
drinkability
had
a
very
low
rating
overall
there
wasnt
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
hard
to
drink
not
worth
seeking
out
but
not
worth
avoiding
either
overall
this
beer
is
one
to
come
back
to
frequently
for
those
who
seek
a
wellrounded
oatmeal
stout
abv
is
fairly
low
which
aids
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
that
gives
orange
lacing
when
hit
with
light
topped
by
a
tan
foam
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
of
a
hint
of
coffee
and
some
flaked
oats
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
a
bit
absent
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
on
the
flavor
hints
of
roast
but
not
much
more
its
not
bad
just
not
special
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
too
watery
for
my
liking
as
well
to
the
point
where
the
minerals
in
the
water
are
the
most
obvious
on
the
palate
it
drinks
pretty
well
its
good
for
watching
a
football
game
as
i
am
now
go
bears
the
mouthfeel
does
have
the
silkiness
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
finishes
with
a
buttload
of
bitterness
even
when
warmed
up
the
uber
bitterness
becomes
too
much
and
opening
another
is
out
of
the
question
perhaps
ill
open
an
imperial
ipa
to
wash
out
the
lingering
bitterness
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
very
well
this
wold
be
nice
on
those
bitter
cold
afternoons
and
evenings
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
while
watching
the
snow
fall
it
seems
that
all
breckenridge
brewing
co
brews
ive
tried
lack
with
head
and
head
retention
even
with
aggressive
pours
they
just
dont
produce
or
hang
around
drinkability
wonderful
beer
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
m
too
light
and
not
creamy
enough
for
a
high
rating
good
carbonation
level
d
pretty
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
medium
bodied
nice
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
but
smoothed
over
pretty
easy
a
brew
i
would
drink
again
and
recommend
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nothing
super
surprising
but
there
doesnt
have
to
be
when
it
is
done
like
this
for
the
price
8
99
a
6
pack
it
is
a
heck
of
a
deal
d
this
is
kind
of
a
chore
to
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
warped
taste
make
for
a
stout
that
goes
down
less
than
easy
another
gift
from
my
trusty
midwest
connection
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
jet
black
with
little
body
and
minimal
head
has
a
roasted
malty
aroma
taste
is
lighter
and
a
tad
watery
than
you
would
think
has
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
overall
i
was
not
impressed
and
this
beer
doesnt
stand
up
to
a
decent
porter
d
definitely
drinkable
to
the
last
drop
even
at
less
than
cold
temperatures
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
oatmeal
stout
but
decent
d
big
body
malty
and
surprisingly
bittered
this
is
a
great
mountain
state
oatmeal
stout
sweet
smooth
big
and
relaxed
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
and
probably
brecks
best
beer
ive
tried
to
date
d
id
enjoy
another
one
perhaps
when
the
weather
cools
a
bit
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
reckon
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
not
bad
for
the
price
8
70
a
6
pack
i
have
been
seeing
breckenridge
around
columbus
for
some
time
now
and
always
seem
to
find
an
excuse
to
buy
something
else
this
beer
proves
ive
been
stalling
for
too
long
time
to
try
some
more
of
their
stuff
d
this
is
chocolate
city
here
like
a
dark
chocolate
bar
transformed
into
a
delicious
beer
first
breckenridge
made
me
a
fan
with
their
vanilla
porter
now
theyve
outdone
themselves
with
this
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
stick
with
the
dark
dark
beers
with
these
guys
super
beer
itll
be
a
shame
when
my
lone
bottle
of
this
is
gone
edit
this
review
was
for
the
thunder
stout
which
is
what
the
beer
handles
say
at
their
pubs
not
sure
if
it
was
always
their
oatmeal
stout
or
not
but
i
could
swear
it
tasted
different
last
year
now
not
as
much
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
it
smells
a
lot
like
i
expect
an
oatmeal
stout
to
smell
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
burnt
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
oats
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
all
in
all
the
lack
of
surprises
here
and
unassuming
nature
seems
overly
dumbed
down
for
mass
appeal
id
drink
another
but
only
if
somebody
else
was
buying
drinkability
like
the
beer
would
drink
this
again
d
a
real
session
stout
very
little
carbonation
makes
it
easy
to
drink
drinkability
i
like
it
and
would
buy
it
again
does
this
seem
a
little
perfunctory
why
am
i
speeding
through
the
review
im
not
really
i
just
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
here
its
decent
worth
drinking
sure
worth
talking
about
not
so
much
pretty
much
just
a
dead
average
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
drinkability
a
smooth
flavorful
beer
nothing
over
the
top
spectacular
but
a
nice
session
ale
do
this
has
stop
at
one
written
all
over
it
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
poured
a
very
nice
deep
brown
near
black
color
although
with
just
a
bit
of
head
and
no
lacing
nice
scent
some
roasted
grains
with
a
little
extra
sweetness
but
nothing
very
deep
nice
flavor
good
roasted
grains
and
a
nice
near
coffee
taste
with
a
nice
extra
bit
of
sweetness
and
fullness
from
the
oats
went
down
quite
smooth
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
because
of
the
low
abv
its
drinkable
but
it
lacks
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
coming
back
ive
had
this
at
the
pub
in
co
before
and
remember
it
as
being
better
could
be
that
it
simply
isnt
as
fresh
but
the
smokeness
stands
out
right
now
depending
on
your
tastebuds
that
could
be
a
bad
or
a
good
thing
i
suppose
d
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
certainly
drinkable
but
not
a
first
choice
d
could
be
a
little
too
much
on
the
bitterdark
chocolateespresso
side
for
me
to
really
session
but
this
is
a
simply
outstanding
brew
that
deserves
a
purchase
if
only
for
the
outstanding
nose
good
damn
beer
great
color
on
this
beer
almost
black
but
poured
with
only
a
slight
brown
head
it
has
an
upfront
bitterness
to
it
but
then
you
get
some
chocolate
flavors
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
im
not
getting
much
in
aroma
but
i
have
a
cold
so
that
may
well
be
a
factor
it
feels
creamy
if
not
slightly
oily
the
more
i
drink
the
more
of
a
bakers
chocolate
flavor
is
coming
through
nice
beer
for
cold
weather
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
do
enjoy
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
and
youngs
but
i
would
have
to
say
this
beer
easily
contends
with
those
beers
pours
black
and
viscous
with
a
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
strong
and
full
of
big
roasted
coffee
aroma
the
body
is
hearty
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
but
it
could
be
thicker
for
such
a
big
flavored
body
the
finish
is
gradual
and
becomes
sweeter
as
it
progresses
the
flavor
transitions
from
the
robust
coffee
flavor
to
a
sweet
chocolate
flavor
before
quickly
fading
away
d
im
very
impressed
with
this
oatmeal
stout
and
i
feel
like
its
a
bit
underrated
on
ba
i
dont
know
if
some
people
got
a
hold
of
some
bad
bottles
or
what
but
i
thought
this
was
a
spectacular
stout
well
done
breckenridge
d
smooth
beer
it
is
drinkable
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
where
this
style
should
be
and
usually
is
quite
filling
and
after
two
i
usually
stop
but
this
one
i
could
drink
a
few
more
than
two
it
is
light
however
i
would
buy
this
one
again
i
think
it
is
good
d
this
beer
is
good
in
the
morning
on
a
fall
day
or
late
in
the
evening
on
a
warm
june
night
for
me
this
beer
is
best
when
enjoying
one
at
a
time
i
sat
at
a
table
with
3
other
people
who
all
prefer
differnt
styles
agreed
that
it
was
the
best
new
beer
we
have
tried
for
a
while
overall
worthy
i
will
buy
this
again
sticks
around
tastewise
doesnt
evolve
into
the
tobacco
taste
some
stouts
will
do
not
a
complex
oatmeal
stout
but
its
hard
to
make
a
bad
version
of
this
style
straight
forward
d
all
this
has
going
for
it
is
looks
and
thats
not
enough
to
save
it
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
i
wont
even
bother
to
finish
the
bottle
if
you
want
good
beer
look
elsewhere
you
could
definitely
throw
down
a
lot
of
these
easily
luckily
there
isnt
much
alcohol
in
these
this
is
a
very
nice
effort
from
breckenridge
its
always
interesting
to
see
where
a
brewery
goes
with
a
special
like
and
oatmeal
stout
and
this
is
a
good
one
a
good
flavor
creamy
body
and
low
abv
lend
some
great
drinkability
to
this
one
eric
drinkability
definitly
a
good
oatmeal
stout
that
i
will
have
to
try
again
only
the
slightest
burgundy
hues
escape
this
opaque
beer
when
held
up
to
bright
light
the
head
is
attractive
but
look
away
and
its
gone
lacing
is
minimal
coffee
notes
and
woody
aromas
cocoa
nibs
in
the
taste
with
a
little
unpleasant
bitterness
way
too
watery
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
low
abv
makes
this
a
fine
drinkable
brew
not
a
bad
stout
but
middle
of
the
road
for
me
beer
poured
black
with
a
near
perfect
tan
head
nose
was
roasted
malts
with
sweet
chocolate
lingering
in
the
background
taste
was
roasted
malts
hints
of
coffee
sweet
chocolate
with
a
light
bittering
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
stout
with
plenty
of
character
that
would
keep
me
coming
back
d
a
decent
stout
overall
not
the
most
complex
example
of
the
style
but
pleasant
enough
rotation
now
that
ive
had
it
again
its
sure
to
be
part
of
the
stoutporter
rotation
again
tap
hell
yeah
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
its
low
abv
medium
body
make
it
sessionable
just
be
aware
that
the
flavor
smell
are
subdued
drinkability
an
unexpected
surprise
from
breckenridge
and
a
quality
oatmeal
stout
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
on
hand
once
the
weather
starts
getting
cold
when
my
wife
and
i
move
to
new
york
then
again
im
sure
because
i
said
that
breckenridge
may
not
be
available
though
theyre
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
is
the
former
all
the
way
plus
at
4
5
you
can
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
feel
bad
or
like
you
need
to
hit
the
gym
right
after
pours
black
with
brown
highlights
with
very
little
mocha
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
burnt
characters
the
taste
starts
malty
with
some
nice
sweet

and
finishes
with
a

flavor
the
burnt
flavor
sticks
throughout
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
nice
and
smooth
but
a
medium
body
detracts
from
this
stout
i
expected
a
heavy
or
substantial
mouthfeel
but
seems
watery
for
a
stout
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
flavors
make
up
for
the
lack
in
body
an
overall
nice
beer
breckenridge
oatmeal
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
mostly
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
similar
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
meld
nicely
overall
pretty
decent
i
would
recommend
it

would
gladly
have
again
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
rich
smooth
good
carbonation
level
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
perhaps
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
had
to
date
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
fazed
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
lingering
pillowy
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
caramelized
malt
medium
roasted
grain
milk
chocolate
mildly
bitter
hops
brown
sugar
and
coffee
hovering
between
medium
and
full
bodied
due
to
the
oatmeal
addition
this
stout
is
amply
carbonated
as
well
tasty
accessible
and
quite
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
it
leaves
a
ton
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
i
worked
my
way
through
it
smells
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
oatmeal
thrown
it
tastes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
a
big
does
of
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
closer
to
a
porter
i
drank
this
was
pretty
damn
quick
a
very
tasty
beer
d
ill
have
another
please
as
far
as
oatmeal
stouts
goes
this
is
up
there
way
up
there
i
would
like
to
see
more
alcohol
in
this
that
is
about
the
only
complain
i
have
just
needs
more
of
a
kick
to
it
i
think
but
then
again
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
who
really
loves
imperials
and
such
drinkability
is
great
definitely
a
sessionable
stout
with
a
nice
oatmeal
creaminess
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
and
would
certainly
make
it
one
of
my
regular
choices
were
it
available
locally
this
stout
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
very
minimal
head
slight
malt
aroma
but
mostly
burnt
coffee
just
slightly
bitter
taste
with
an
average
drinkability
you
can
do
worse
but
you
can
do
so
much
better
overall
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
stout
the
potential
is
there
i
will
try
another
bottle
in
a
few
days
and
maybe
it
will
be
better
its
not
tasty
enough
to
be
dreamy
but
the
idea
of
pairing
it
with
dry
unsweetened
chocolate
or
maybe
a
bowl
of
cheerios
for
breakfast
is
the
final
verdict
a
solid
stout
but
anything
more
dream
on
future
outlook
decent
but
not
really
worth
revisiting
a
little
nutty
a
bit
dry
tasting
but
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
and
will
be
drinking
it
again
overall
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
and
i
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
when
i
find
it
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
and
formed
a
short
lived
medium
tan
head
over
a
very
deep
brown
almost
black
opaque
body
some
light
lacing
remained
through
to
the
bottom
the
smell
is
mostly
a
standard
stout
mix
of
roasted
and
toasted
grain
and
espresso
with
little
if
any
hops
presence
and
mirrors
the
taste
yet
theres
a
little
bitter
pine
in
the
aftertaste
thats
overpowered
by
espresso
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
not
too
bad
overall
not
bad
and
yet
i
feel
guilty
for
reviewing
this
beer
the
brewery
didnt
feel
it
important
enough
to
mark
the
brewing
dates
on
the
bottles
indeed
only
the
stout
was
marked
in
a
mixed
case
with
any
dates
yet
not
marked
or
notched
to
indicate
the
actual
bottling
date
perhaps
this
beer
is
better
fresher
but
as
i
know
not
when
it
was
brewed
then
ill
review
their
beers
as
i
drink
them
regardless
of
the
condition
of
the
beer
at
least
this
wasnt
a
drain
pour
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
light
slightly
passes
through
about
a
one
finger
tan
head
with
some
splotchy
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
chocolate
and
nuts
malts
definitely
come
through
taste
is
of
bitter
chocolate
malts
and
coffee
slight
hop
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
not
to
say
its
a
light
beer
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
makes
it
a
lighter
stout
overall
an
ok
beer
drinkability
although
the
flavor
profile
is
not
outstanding
this
is
a
very
nice
drinker
quite
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
slightly
tart
smooth
and
slick
on
the
swallow
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
its
well
done
and
i
think
it
hits
the
style
mark
quite
well
d
i
dont
hate
it
but
it
isnt
something
id
want
another
of
a
somewhat
subdued
and
uninteresting
stout
nothing
wrong
with
breckenridges
effort
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
apart
a
easy
drinking
session
brew
flavor
is
pleasant
and
unified
but
not
outstanding
overall
nothing
special
here
decent
but
wouldnt
search
it
out
mouthfeel
was
pretty
heavy
and
creamy
but
not
enough
to
make
the
beer
undrinkable
not
much
sign
of
carbonation
loved
the
coating
feeling
this
one
had
going
down
would
definitely
drink
again
not
bad
but
could
use
a
little
work
and
it
would
be
very
good
notes
from
41606
dive
enjoyed
drinking
this
six
pack
and
sharing
it
with
my
friends
a
decent
brew
enjoyed
by
a
friend
who
usually
sticks
to
coors
light
so
its
got
to
be
drinkable
not
anything
wild
but
a
solid
session
brew
beer
is
very
drinkable
despite
its
appearance
not
heavy
at
all
could
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
good
flavors
would
buy
again
the
taste
is
predictably
heavy
on
the
coffee
and
toasted
malt
tones
with
some
late
breaking
hop
balance
the
finish
is
dry
and
very
smooth
thanks
to
a
noticeable
oat
presence
chocolate
tones
join
the
rest
in
the
aftertaste
id
like
to
see
the
carbonation
dialed
back
a
notch
but
thats
just
a
personal
pet
peeve
overall
this
is
a
very
serviceable
oatmeal
stout
ideal
for
winter
quaffing
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
near
black
12
of
head
decent
lacing
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malts
taste
is
good
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
little
bitterness
theres
also
a
hint
of
burnt
malt
after
taste
is
mostly
of
dark
chocolatecocoa
drinkability
is
good
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
quite
for
such
a
heavy
beer
i
could
probably
drink
about
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
tannish
to
light
brown
head
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
you
can
smell
the
oats
in
it
also
but
then
the
scent
turns
metallic
body
is
quite
thin
and
the
head
disappated
quickly
but
really
who
cares
because
this
was
a
highly
drinkable
nice
session
beer
burnt
nutty
taste
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
it
d
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
much
roast
i
remember
trying
this
before
i
got
into
craft
beer
and
didnt
like
it
much
so
i
thought
id
give
it
another
go
still
not
very
good
though
i
can
appreciate
it
a
bit
more
it
just
has
no
complexity
at
all
i
would
much
rather
drink
a
goose
island
oatmeal
stout
any
day
lightly
bodied
wellcarbonated
it
would
be
eminently
drinkable
if
i
appreciated
its
flavor
more
smooth
full
body
enough
carbonation
for
style
i
could
drink
these
all
night
i
dig
this
beer
would
buy
again
all
the
beers
in
the
mixer
twelve
pack
are
good
pale
amber
vanilla
porter
and
this
one
overall
i
was
very
pleased
and
surprised
at
how
this
was
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
sometime
d
great
flavor
and
feel
make
for
a
good
drinker
i
could
see
putting
more
than
a
couple
of
these
back
on
a
cooler
day
tailgating
or
as
a
nice
fallwinter
nightcap
overall
a
great
brew
d
this
is
one
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
without
getting
sick
but
thats
about
it
definitely
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
of
these
pours
a
black
black
dark
black
with
a
mocha
that
fades
to
a
small
ring
with
streaks
down
the
glass
aroma
is
of
dark
toast
and
a
slight
coriander
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
of
ethiopian
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
with
an
abundance
of
small
soft
carbonation
an
above
average
oatmeal
stout
from
breckenridge
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
you
havent
tried
one
yet
you
need
to
get
off
of
your
ass
and
get
one
now
it
gives
a
good
name
to
the
oatmeal
stout
style
its
americanmade
but
still
incredibly
good
i
regret
only
having
one
of
them
quite
nice
here
i
guess
i
am
surprised
i
like
this
better
than
many
and
think
it
is
borderline
great
recommended
drinking
will
be
buying
this
one
again
if
im
gonna
sit
down
and
have
a
stout
i
wouldnt
mind
it
being
this
d
a
light
weight
on
the
stomach
goes
down
easy
and
is
not
very
filling
the
flavors
would
work
for
me
all
year
round
versus
most
stouts
for
me
overall
another
tasty
breckenridge
beer
very
smooth
and
definitely
sessionable
overall
this
is
truly
a
very
good
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
tasted
on
52508
heavybodied
with
a
heavy
smoky
taste
to
it
there
is
some
bitterness
at
the
end
in
my
opinion
not
very
smooth
the
smokiness
can
be
a
little
overpowering
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
ive
had
better
beers
oatmeal
stouts
but
this
beer
is
worth
drinking
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
poured
up
inky
black
with
a
khaki
coloured
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
nice
sticky
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
looked
good
smell
was
dominated
easily
by
a
somewhat
assertive
used
coffee
grounds
aroma
which
i
found
very
pleasant
flavour
too
was
dominated
by
this
characteristic
with
little
else
coming
through
save
for
some
very
modest
tones
of
toasted
malt
and
oatmeal
this
should
be
relabeled
breckenridge
espresso
stout
or
something
and
have
a
bit
of
coffe
thrown
in
the
wort
to
make
it
so
mouthfeel
is
right
about
where
it
needs
to
be
for
a
stout
being
neither
too
thin
nor
cloyingly
heavy
but
right
in
between
those
two
granted
this
is
the
wrong
time
of
year
to
be
drinking
something
of
this
calibre
it
was
a
good
stout
that
i
will
drink
in
the
future
not
bad
d
great
with
grill
roasted
vegetables
d
i
am
pretty
impressed
with
this
for
2
a
bomber
you
cant
beat
this
the
brew
is
a
little
thin
at
the
end
but
still
very
drinkable
probably
second
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
had
behind
samuel
smiths
medium
body
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
breckenridges
better
brews
very
good
beer
smooth
on
taste
very
easy
to
drink
and
went
well
with
my
ribs
the
nitro
tap
also
made
for
a
great
show
inside
my
glass
the
staff
at
the
bar
stewart
was
amazing
very
friendly
and
i
had
a
ball
i
love
stouts
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
this
one
somewhat
disappointed
me
it
is
decent
but
doesnt
hold
to
the
true
nature
of
what
oatmeal
stouts
are
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
rank
it
with
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
fairly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
well
worth
trying
would
be
a
good
choice
when
introducing
newbies
to
the
style
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
its
likely
something
ill
come
back
to
at
some
point
breckenridge
brewery
are
masters
at
dark
beers
this
oatmeal
stout
needs
to
be
served
55
degrees
to
enjoy
the
full
potentialjust
like
cheese
i
first
tried
it
cold
from
the
fridge
and
the
taste
was
minimal
until
it
warmed
up
very
drinkable
and
sophisticated
try
there
other
dark
beersyou
cant
go
wrong
ddecent
but
not
great
oatmeal
flavor
is
decent
nothing
too
overpowering
or
offensive
theres
a
good
bit
of
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
oat
but
i
was
hoping
that
the
smoothness
of
the
oats
would
have
pulled
through
a
bit
more
the
mouthfeel
helps
out
the
flavor
in
a
major
way
with
its
mediumthick
body
spoton
carbonation
level
and
excellent
bitter
chocolatehop
bite
on
the
finish
id
have
this
beer
again
it
delivered
a
nice
complexity
and
flavor
profile
without
being
too
overbearing
all
in
all
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
cool
night
id
definitely
drink
this
again
picked
this
up
last
weekend
on
the
way
back
from
atlanta
its
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
not
the
best
but
pretty
drinkable
i
loved
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
several
years
and
im
glad
to
see
them
closed
to
alabama
not
much
of
a
head
but
its
tandark
tan
and
doesnt
hang
around
much
typical
drier
taste
as
an
oatmeal
stout
should
opaque
and
dark
brown
looks
good
in
a
glass
i
enjoy
this
beer
especially
if
im
looking
for
a
stout
thats
not
too
heavy
feeling
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
richness
beckons
slower
sips
id
have
guessed
the
abv
was
a
good
bit
higher
even
though
theres
really
no
alcohol
taste
just
thickness
finish
is
medium
and
appetizing
for
the
next
sip
beer
pours
out
nearly
black
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
along
with
good
lacing
smells
of
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
mostly
dominated
by
a
coffee
taste
with
a
burnt
edge
to
it
beer
felt
pretty
good
as
it
went
down
a
little
thin
but
overall
it
wasnt
bad
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
before
i
went
looking
for
a
better
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
looks
like
plenty
of
people
dig
this
one
thats
cool
its
just
not
quite
doing
it
for
me
this
was
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
id
prefer
a
little
more
sweetness
and
creaminess
with
it
but
it
gets
the
job
done
pretty
tasty
overall
and
a
nice
drinkable
brew
i
could
easily
see
myself
going
thru
34
in
an
evening
not
bad
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
id
prefer
more
thickness
for
this
kind
of
beer
carbonation
is
okay
drinkability
is
average

its
average
flavor
overall
its
okay
worth
a
try

super
dark
molasses
with

nothing
the
stickiness
is

good

this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
brown
around
the
edges
the
head
is
onw
inch
in
height
and
dark
tan
in
color
it
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cream
vanilla
toffee
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
roasted
malt
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
nothing
really
wows
me
about
it
but
i
would
drink
it
again
this
pint
was
black
with
mahogany
edges
covered
by
fine
dark
tan
foam
good
head
retention
and
there
was
plenty
of
thick
solid
foam
covering
the
glass
the
aroma
was
fairly
mild
a
bit
of
roast
chocolate
and
caramel
the
flavour
was
dominated
by
sweet
caramel
maltiness
some
toffee
and
milk
chocolate
bitterness
was
solid
but
not
quite
up
to
the
task
of
balancing
the
malt
there
was
also
a
pleasant
lingering
roastiness
and
a
kiss
of
hop
flavour
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
creamy
texture
carbonation
was
a
little
aggressive
in
my
serving
but
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
overall
id
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
if
it
was
available
and
its
certainly
tasty
but
i
wouldnt
go
searching
it
out
again
poured
a
black
body
with
minimal
white
head
that
stuck
around
while
drinking
looks
good
and
had
a
coffeeish
aroma
while
smelling
the
taste
fit
the
smellcoffee
and
a
little
unsweetened
chocolate
i
enjoyed
the
taste
but
there
was
a
mild
burntroast
flavor
that
gave
a
little
unpleasant
harshness
on
the
finish
there
were
minimal
hop
aromas
to
speak
of
but
the
hop
bitterness
added
to
the
burnt
floavor
of
the
coffee
which
increased
the
harsher
flavor
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
and
enjoyable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
extraordinary
although
i
would
drink
it
again
nice
rich
coffee
roastiness
with
a
hearty
malty
body
but
im
not
able
to
taste
any
strong
oatmeal
presence
fair
amount
of
bitterness
and
some
burnt
tastes
i
liked
the
amount
of
carbonation
which
was
noticeably
more
than
that
of
a
guinness
or
boddingtons
and
the
thickness
was
good
could
use
a
touch
of
sweetness
i
think
to
balance
out
the
taste
overall
it
wasnt
bad
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
its
pretty
average
imo
enjoyable
but
nothing
spectacular
seems
to
have
a
lighter
body
than
expected
and
it
is
not
filling
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
another
one
of
these
now
or
later

still
i
kind
of
enjoyed
it
and
id
weakly
recommend
d
overall
this
is

nothing
to

at

overall
a

certainly
wouldnt

that
is
somewhat
coating

it

certainly
a
session
candidate
d
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
that
is
a
tinge
sweeter
and
lighter
than
most
in
feel
w
a
nice
flavor
a
well
balanced
stout
w
relatively
few
flaws
jus
not
the
filling
kind
of
breakfast
beer
you
might
be
looking
for
i
could
drink
this
often
i
consider
it
very
drinkable
this
was
on
nitro
at
the
breckenridge
brewerybbq
and
had
the
telltale
cascading
head
it
was
black
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
looked
like
a
guinness
smells
were
slight
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
roasted
oats
and
malts
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
and
went
well
with
the
rack
of
ribs
it
smells
coming
back
to
edit
i
just
finished
the
last
few
sips
and
drank
them
quicker
than
the
others
this
beer
does
seem
watery
when
you
drink
it
quicker
but
it
still
leaves
a
very
full
coating
of
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
i
took
half
a
point
off
of
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
oatmeal
stout
not
bad
but
not
great
there
are
much
better
stouts
out
there
oatmeal
or
otherwise
this
could
make
for
a
decent
session
as
its
smooth
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
really
great
stout
it
has
a
really
strong
first
flavor
a
coffee
then
the
other
favors
come
into
affect
also
not
as
heavy
as
most
stouts
are
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
think
this
was
a
porter
a
decent
beer
not
the
best
stout
but
pleasant
enough
to
try
and
drink
again
very
light
mouthfeel
on
the
watery
side
with
a
slight
amount
of
cloying
was
bland
not
interesting
at
all
not

i
was

its
still
a
pretty

nice
effort
would
not

having
it
again
especially
on
tap
good
bbalanced
beer
with
perfect

d
would
not
drink
this
again
as
theres
nothing
to
it
just
not
really
an
enjoyable
beer
by
any
means
especially
when
in
the
market
for
something
with
a
bold
malt
presence
they
really
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
the
bitter
and
stale
tastes
are
all
that
came
through
for
me
and
didnt
make
for
a
good
drinking
experience
for
lack
of
a
better
word
it
went
down
harsh
md
rough
hard
to
drink
though
not
a
pour
i
am
shocked
everything
i
have
had
from
breckenridge
up
to
this
has
been
amazing
i
need
to
trade
for
another
one
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
one
if
i
find
that
i
had
a
bad
one
i
will
edit
this
ut
for
now
a
surprisingly
low
score
d
drinkable
and
flavorful
complex
oatmeal
stout
well
worth
a
try
best
of
all
its
sessionable
12oz

and
a
bit
of
oak
standard
stout
flavors
here
nothing
special
a
quality
made
and
tasty
beer
just
nothing
special
overall
id
have
to
say
this
beer
is
a
winner
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
stout
ill
definitely
try
it
again
not
bad
not
wonderful
id
be
up
for
a
retaste
some
day
this
is
a
nice
drinking
porter
while
the
burnt
acidity
is
kept
low
here
definitely
a
good
thing
in
a
beer
of
this
gravity
it
could
certainly
be
improved
if
it
was
even
a
bit
less
i
really
like
the
toasted
malt
notes
in
the
aroma
and
flavors
though
it
makes
me
think
of
dry
oatmeal
that
has
been
left
to
toast
in
the
oven
i
could
easily
quaff
a
couple
pints
of
this
brew
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
forming
a
very
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
leaving
light
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
smelling
mostly
of
coffee
taste
is
strong
coffee
light
roasted
malt
with
no
hops
detectable
not
exactly
what
i
expected
it
to
taste
like
medium
mouthfeel
along
with
a
clean
smooth
finish
overall
not
a
bad
stout
but
nothing
really
there
to
seperate
it
from
the
rest
a
very
sessionable
stout
very
much
drier
than
expected
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
i
really
liked
this
the
bold
roasted
flavor
added
so
much
depth
and
quality
to
it
highly
recommended
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
lineup
is
as
solid
as
this
tasty
treat
very
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
little
going
on
in
the
nose
with
coffee
and
roasted
barley
all
at
subdued
level
taste
is
on
the
light
side
as
well
with
notes
of
roasted
barley
coffee
toasted
oats
and
smokey
chalky
tones
hops
offers
up
some
fruity
and
faint
spice
balance
medium
body
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
is
a
little
much
for
my
liking
but
leaves
a
descent
soft
mouthfeel
the
finish
might
be
the
best
part
of
this
beer
a
big
oat
character
with
notes
that
are
dry
roasty
and
nutty
aroma
of
soft
coffee
and
caramel
the
roasted
malt
tended
to
be
light
as
well
tasted
somewhat
watered
down
nothing
overwhelming
like
a
dark
ipa
some
dry
hops
at
the
end
drinkable
but
not
great
finish
is
medium
long
and
slighty
sour
drinkability
great
the
thin
make
up
of
this
wonderful
oatmeal
stout
makes
it
drinkable
any
day
of
the
week

the

the
color
was

i
experienced
a
good

in

the
finish
was
more
chocolaty
with
a

especially
in
the

of
the
throat
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
from
breckenridge
i
like
the
smoked
characterisitc
it
adds
a
very
unique
detail
great
session
beer
plenty
good
but
pretty
darn
bitter
i
think
the
nitro
kind
of
takes
away
some
from
the
characteer
of
this

around
a

minutes
before
becoming

that
would
remain
nearly
to

some

left
behind
the
aroma
was

the
taste
was
roasted

with

the
body
was
light

medium
light
for
the
style
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
fairly
good
thankfully
after
the
vanilla
sweetness
of
the
porter
dissipated
i
was
able
to
fully
enjoy
this
hearty
stout
it
was
full
of
flavor
roasted
malts
almost
cheeriolike
oats
and
expresso
it
had
all
of
the
thick
meatiness
the
porter
did
not
it
was
dry
with
a
slight
bitter
lingering
this
was
the
perfect
finish

healthy
bounty

of

of

beer

at

dark
brown
with
thick
tan
head
that
lasted
thru
all
the
other
tastings
this
one
was
last
and
excellent
lacing
aroma
was
a
pleasant
blend
of
oatmeal
and
malt
the
flavor
was
a
good
mix
of
chocolate
and
toffee
all
blended
with
the
malty
sweetness
unfortunately
despite
the
excellent
appearance
the
body
was
fairly
thin
which
led
to
a
slightly
watery
finish
this
beer
could
have
been
better
after
the
initial
start
overall
i
was
attracted
by
its
dark
color
but
was
disappointed
in
its
light
mouthfeel
and
smell
despite
an
overall
pleasant
taste

average
oatmeal
stout

lacks
the
complexity
to
be

scent

bit
with
a
smell
like
cold
coffee
overall
a
good
beer
with
an
almost
balanced
taste
i
would
like
it
on
tap
to
see
if
it
smooths
it
out
if
oatmeal
stouts
are
usually
too
sweet
or
mellow
for
you
try
this
one
out
the
next
time
on
a
buying
trip
typical
black
color
though
not
as
black
as
some
not
as
thick
and
smooth
of
a
mouth
feel
as
most
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
of
oatmeal
stouts
but
not
bad
tastes
burnt
an
slightly
coffee
like
with
hints
of
metallic
flavor
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
and
not
good
in
its
own
right
so
its
position
is
untenable
change
the
beer
black
color
tan
head
with
a
decent
lacing
left
behind
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
smell
nothing
overpowering
or
remarkable
taste
is
much
of
the
same
but
a
little
better
im
just
looking
for
a
little
more
to
it
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
but
still
a
little
on
the
thin
side
pretty
good
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
one
is
enough
worthy
of
trying
you
may
love
it

flavors
in
the
finish
not
bad
pours
out
very
nicely
for
a
2

beer
it
smells
like
a
good
stout
only
with
more
flavor
than
most
common
stouts
taste
has
toasted
oatmeal
flavor
written
all
over
it
with
burnt
black
barleycoffee
flavors
as
well
it
has
a
coffee
aftertaste
like
a
dark
roast
its
very
enjoyable
its
thick
and
smooth
in
my
mouth
lovely
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
still
too
thin
for
my
taste
a
little
more
chewiness
wouldnt
hurt
i
gotta
say
im
a
bit
dissapointed
its
rough
around
the
edges
and
while
it
looks
great
both
the
bottle
and
in
the
glass
it
definitely
needs
some
work
i
have
had
this
beer
in
the
past
and
this
bottle
taste
better
then
previous
samplings
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
pretty
good
aroma
is
of
burnt
grainsmalt
and
mildly
plasticy
so
dark
plack
it
almost
has
a
purple
hue
to
it
head
is
a
compreseed
pinky
finger
sized
affair
fore
is
somewhat
smokey
and
toasty
not
at
all
to
style
palate
gets
thin
and
the
flavor
is
watery
with
a
mish
mash
of
weak
chocolate
tone
down
vanilla
cream
and
coffee
just
doesnt
get
it
right
cheers2beers
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
and
certainly
the
best
beer
ive
had
yet
from
breckenridge
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
lingering
burnt
malted
flavor
there
is
also
some
strong
hints
of
dark
chocolate
i
like
the
smoothness
of
the
oatmeal
stout
a
good
brew
merry
christmas
pourer
black

aroma
malts
and
caramel
came
out
1st
than
came
the
molasses
and
chocolate
with
some
coffee
flavor
got
the
same
as
the
aroma
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
ebony
and
opaque
body
with
a
one
finger
khaki
head
that
retains
well
patch
lace
is
quite
prevalent
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
subdued
for
a
stout
with
hints
of
sweet
chocolate
and
smoked
almonds
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
with
a
light
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
smooth
but
lacking
richness
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
present
but
very
little
dark
roastiness
hops
are
vague
but
add
a
nice
balance
very
average
overall
its
your
average
everyday
stout
from
a
typical
microbrewery
aromas
are
solid
and
strong
with
a
good
malt
base
and
heavy
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
a
toasty
yeasty
hoplike
aroma
swirls
around
the
roasted
malts
lightly
mellow
and
sweet
from
lactic
sugars
looks
nearly
opaque
and
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
persists
flavors
are
bold
upfront
with
the
roasted
grain
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
with
a
silky
sweetness
comming
in
quickly
the
beer
quickly
falls
off
of
texture
leaving
a
lightly
watery
and
roasted
grain
texture
that
gets
a
bit
chalky
finishes
quite
the
same
with
a
charcoal
like
aftertaste
not
unpleasant
but
a
bit
weak
late
in
the
drink
something
isnt
quite
there
more
malt
i
think
but
worth
keeping
around
for
the
holidays
the
pending
ice
age
april
poured
a
dark
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
sweet
almost
a
chocolate
fudge
smell
taste
starts
smooth
and
light
with
roasted
caramel
and
coffee
flavours
finish
is
a
little
bitter
and
dry
with
almost
a
burnt
wood
flavour
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
an
average
stout
but
id
probably
drink
it
again
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
er
coffee
i
like
some
stouts
but
this
one
is
a
bit
too
heavily
pinehopped
and
leaves
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
worth
trying
though
im
just
not
buying
a
case
of
it
poured
an
inpenetrable
black
with
light
tan
lace
some
gentle
chocolate
in
the
aroma
smokey
peaty
malt
with
the
barest
touch
of
semisweet
chocolate
not
acidic
but
felt
a
little
thin
in
contrast
with
the
big
malt
a
little
coffee
in
the
finish
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
potential
but
never
seemed
to
put
it
all
together
to
be
better
than
okay
not
particularly
thick
but
passable
mouthfeel
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
carbonation
does
not
stop
but
it
adds
to
the
brew
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
in
mouthfeel
not
to
shabby
of
a
drinking
experience
this
just
appeared
in
local
stores
so
it
must
be
a
seasonal
thats
fresh
from
the
brewery
nice
silkscreened
bottle
but
no
freshness
date
pours
a
two
finger
really
frothy
brown
head
its
the
color
of
light
brown
sugar
the
beer
is
pitch
black
and
has
a
hint
of
mahogeny
edgings
when
held
to
light
smell
is
roasted
grains
lactose
and
cotton
it
just
has
a
milky
smooth
smell
about
it
chocolate
became
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warmed
tastes
dry
roasted
grain
it
would
be
rough
but
there
is
a
smoothness
in
the
malt
sweet
and
the
mouthfeel
that
tame
this
roughness
its
like
dancing
around
in
a
dangerous
situation
because
youve
got
safeguards
you
trust
will
pull
you
out
should
something
go
bad
the
sweet
smooth
carries
some
black
patent
sourbitter
thats
mixed
with
a
really
nice
caramel
flavor
the
roast
wins
out
in
the
end
coming
across
in
the
aftertaste
as
a
sugarsweetened
richly
roasted
coffee
i
think
there
is
some
hop
bitter
mixed
in
with
the
coffee
roast
hop
flavor
is
mildly
grassy
and
comes
across
as
the
rounded
cottony
flavor
i
associate
with
fuggles
or
possibly
williamette
hops
body
is
only
medium
but
its
got
some
silky
qualities
that
you
expect
in
an
oatmeal
stout
nothing
like
samuel
smiths
for
me
the
best
example
of
silky
mouthfeel
but
still
a
nice
feature
as
the
beer
warmed
an
alcohol
presence
became
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
that
was
not
enjoyable
ill
bet
this
will
settle
if
the
beer
is
aged
carbonation
is
on
the
mild
side
of
moderate
and
there
is
really
amazing
lacing
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
a
nice
beer
thats
helped
me
realize
fall
brisk
air
means
that
winter
is
quickly
coming
over
the
next
couple
months
ill
probably
enjoy
a
couple
more
bottle
and
may
set
back
a
bottle
to
age
through
the
summer
a
great
oatmeal
stout
very
smoke
like
character
reminded
me
of
a
rauchbier
in
some
ways
poured
out
to
a
black
coffee
color
with
a
small
brown
colored
head
medium
low
carbonation
lace
was
thick
and
vertical
unlike
anything
ive
seen
in
a
beer
before
aromas
of
coffee
caramel
toffee
smoked
malts
roasted
earth
and
grains
dominated
the
nose
and
implied
a
treat
was
waiting
in
the
glass
taste
was
great
flavors
of
grain
malt
and
earth
were
in
a
cyclone
of
harmony
blending
very
well
my
only
qualm
with
this
brew
is
in
the
mouthfeel
this
was
far
too
weak
lacking
the
thickness
and
depth
of
a
good
oatmeal
stout
still
its
not
enough
to
take
away
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
high
level
of
drinkability
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
beer
will
find
itself
in
my
fridge
again
before
too
long
recommended
this
breckenridge
offering
poured
medium
black
in
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
was
of
oats
and
nuts
along
with
a
slight
roasted
chocolate
aspect
taste
began
was
the
roasted
malt
flavor
that
wasnt
the
most
appealing
to
me
floral
elements
from
the
hops
underneath
along
with
a
lighter
coffee
base
the
flavors
get
rounded
out
nicely
by
the
oat
precense
the
sweeter
oat
flavor
saves
this
beer
finish
is
smooth
this
beer
is
really
smooth
but
a
tad
thin
as
well
decent
offering
but
nothing
mind
blowing
this
one
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
medium
head
that
falls
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
the
nose
some
chocolate
and
roasted
notes
with
a
little
creaminess
tastes
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lot
more
thin
than
id
like
to
see
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
pours
black
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
sparse
coating
over
top
nose
is
appealing
good
roasted
and
lighly
creamy
aroma
with
just
hints
of
chocolate
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
nose
good
roasted
malt
upfront
with
a
creamy
oat
background
finish
is
a
little
subdued
id
like
a
little
more
of
a
flavor
to
hang
on
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
id
like
a
touch
more
creamyness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
i
could
easily
session
this
one
this
may
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
a
few
times
this
winter
this
was
my
first
beer
of
this
variety
and
i
think
it
represented
the
style
well
the
nose
on
this
one
is
the
best
part
the
hops
bittering
is
in
perfect
balance
with
the
sweet
malts
and
the
result
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
domestic
oatmeal
stout
i
have
ever
had
wow
is
this
stuff
good
pours
an
oily
black
with
a
tan
head
frothy
and
dissaptes
quickly
laces
down
nose
is
sweet
malty
and
hints
of
liquorice
the
taste
is
a
nice
sublte
blend
of
oats
and
hops
it
mixes
with
malty
slightly
smokeysweet
after
taste
while
the
mouth
fell
is
slightly
oily
it
is

with

a

worth
a
six
pack
medium
bodied
but
still
somewhat
thin
actually
became
watery
upon
warming
a
decent
stab
at
an
oatmeal
but
this
one
needs
some
malty
push
to
be
a
good
one
d
not
bad
but
not
worthy
of
a
six
pack
appearance
is
mahogany
brown
with
a
beighe
head

foam
that
leaves

lacing
aroma

macciato
and
honey
initial
taste
contains
mocha
and
malt
followed
by
indeterminate
flavors
that
mimic
roasted
meal
and
some
hops
very
dry
finish
that
leaves
a
clean
palate
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
black
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
patent
and
chocolate
malts
along
with
a
dry
oatmeal
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
creamy
black
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
an
oatmeal
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
stout
it
really
has
a
nice
earthy
black
malt
and
oatmeal
flavor
a
good
drinker
drinks
down
easy
enough
but
lacks
some
truer
oatmeal
stout
qualities
i
like
too
see
in
the
style
a
very
fairly
priced
and
decent
oatmeal
stout
jet
black
body
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
to
an
uneven
surface
on
to
of
the
beer
very
rich
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
smell
i
would
not
know
this
as
an
oatmeal
stout
if
i
didnt
see
it
on
the
label
taste
is
also
dark
and
rich
with
bitter
chocolate
and
a
good
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
not
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
beer

a

yes
a

cheaper
than

fyi
breckenridge
has
pulled
no
punches
with
their
deeply
roasty
oatmeal
stout
it
delivers
the
typical
appearance
with
the
exception
that
the
head
retention
could
be
a
bit
better
the
nose
is
quite
nice
and
roasty
black
coffee
mixes
with
softer
notes
of
caramel
wet
brown
sugar
and
molasses
welcoming
you
to
take
a
sip
the
flavor
however
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
suggests
but
the
dense
roastiness
remains
its
more
like
burnt
coffee
than
espresso
and
it
becomes
quite
dry
in
the
finish
its
fullthrottle

also
slightly
unbalanced

comments
i
was
looking
for
something
to
brighten
my
day
and
this
was
it
i
think
ill
have
oatmeal
for
breakfast
tomorrow
morning
to
continue
the
good
vibe
drinkability
a
very
good
stout
easily
approachable
imo
definitely
worth
a
try
i
look
forward
to
try
additional
brew
from
breckenridge
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
has
brown
specks
all
through
it
smell
is
mostly
of
the
roasted
barley
giving
it
a
coffeelike
aroma
with
a
hint
of
freshly
baked
yeasty
dark
rye
bread
taste
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
barley
and
malt
a
bit
of
the
hops
the
oatmeal
flavor
characteristic
of
most
oatmeal
stouts
is
very
much
lacking
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
papaya
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
refreshingly
light
smooth
but
in
an
oily
way
for
a
stout
we
dont
taste
with
our
eyes
at
any
rate
but
i
still
find
it
drinkable
maybe
they
should
take
the
oatmeal
out
of
the
description
but
it
is
a
nice
brew
and
it
makes
me
want
to
explore
breckenridges

love
the

slight

good
roasted

throughout
dark

with

some
roast
on

decent
roast
in

profile
is
accompanied
by
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
the
body
is
spot
on

its
more
fizzy
than
i
might
have
expected
the
beer
hits
of
cocoa
light
roasted

powdery
chocolate
and
a
creamyalmost
lactose
flavor
a
good
amount
of
flavor
throughout
of
creamy
chocolate
and
coffee
but
in
general
a
medium
beer
for
the
style
on
tap
x
x
x
x
the
flavor
is
really
the
showstopper
here
as
it
just
unleashes
mocha
caramel
and
vanilla
along
with
having
a
silky
or
velvet
smooth
mouthfeel
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
wonderful
beer
o
nice
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
and
dont
wanna
reach
for
the
11abv
flavor

kinda
mild

was
turning
me
off
a
lil
at
first
but
the
flavor
didnt
carry
some
of
the
deficiencies
could
be
a
good
french
press
guinea
pig
to
try
different
flavors
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
reach
for
this
one
but
that
being
said
it
does
have
its
place
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
creamy
stout
option
a
bit
thinner
than
i
like
but
overall
a
good
stout
o
very
well
put
together
oat
stout
probably
my
favorite
not
much
of
a
nose
on
this
beer
but
nice

taste
getting
more
chocolate
than
rolled

pretty
dam
good
stout
think
i
will
have
another
lighter
than
other
oatmeal

with
plenty
of

afterwards

hey
i
like
this
beer
i
just
dont
go
over

for
it
o
very
pleasant
traditional
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
smooth

a
touch
of

its
well
made
and
that
is
certainly

its

i
couldnt

about
it
this
was
yummy
this
beer
looks
and
smells
like
it
should
but
the
taste
falls
flat
it
starts
off
nicely
but
has
a
burnt
finish
that
overpowers
this
otherwise
pleasant
beer
ill
drink
it
if
youre
buying
big
cocoa
and
coffee
presence
coffee
dominates
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
harsh

a
very

with

particular
batch
color
is
a

than
id
expect
as
well
but
that
can
be
forgiven
a
solid
brew
that
i
quite
enjoyed
cheers
for

man
amazing
oatmeal
stout
smooth
rich
sweet
and
creamy
smokey
undertones
o
a
light
yet
complex
ale
that
increases
in
complexity
as
it
warms
sets
the
standard
for
a
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
has
a
nice
coffee
and
dark
malt
character
with
that
oatmeal
and
the
bitterness
is
mild
at
the
end
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
gotta
say
right
off
the
bat
i
was
disappointed
in
this
brew
as
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
all
the
other
firestone
beers
i
have
had
it
could
just
be
a
bad
batch
i
presume
but
it
is
hard
to
say
the
beer
is
very
black
almost
too
black
to
be
enjoyable
considering
the
horrid
burnt
wood
taste
it
is
nowhere
as
thick
as
other
stouts
and
it
took
me
several
weeks
to
finish
this
6
pack
off
overall
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
firestone
walker
and
would
rate
it
as
one
of
the
top
3
breweries
in
the
state
of
california
but
i
have
to
say
this
really
was
just
not
that
great
not
terrible
but
just
not
worth
the
time
or
money
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
taste
i
would
expect
an
oatmeal
stout
to
be
more
creamy
and
lemon
perhaps
the
beer
should
have
been
tasted
fresher
but
it
is
within
the
date
ranger
recommended
by
the
brewer
only
draw
back
seasonal
however
a
winter
offering
cheers
overall
amongst
all
the
high
abv
stouts
the
lower
abv
stouts
can
be
overlooked
too
frequently
however
velvet
merlin
is
a
great
stout
that
does
a
few
great
things
rather
than
a
bunch
of
average
things
90
a
recommendation
seek
out
only
if
youre
a
diehard
fw
fan
theres
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
pours
dark
as
the
night
leaving
behind
a
trace
of
lacing
which
remains
persitant
for
the
glass
very
mild
yet
quite
on
point
mixture
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
roasted
oats
a
touch
of
bitterness
smoothed
out
by
the
chocolate
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
finish
is
quite
sublime
silky
smooth
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
very
light
yet
offering
some
complexity
hoping
that
it
improves
further
with
age
my
new
favorite

wow
just

its

again
overall
this
is
a
very

and
is
true
to
style
if
youre
looking

this

this

i
expected
and
more

than
i
expected
i
was

i
wouldnt

trying

i
am

this

for

a
very

wellbalanced
and
smooth
stout
excellent
dark
and
roasted

flavor
with
a
noticeable
and
pleasing

courtesy
of

the
summary
of
its
parts
overall
after
coming
here
for
a
few
years
i
made
an
account
specifically
to
comment
on
this
brew
i
hate
to
trash
a
beer
from
a
brewery
i
love
but
wow
this
is
bad
watery
mouthfeel
caustic
scent
absolutely
bitter
taste
with
zero
other
qualities
i
dont
think
ive
ever
seen
a
ba
score
90
currently
i
disagree
with
more
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
o
i
wasnt
sure
if
this
one
would
hold
up
9
months
after
being
bottled
but
it
was
killer
a
magical
brew
that
must
be
sought
out
like
the
holy
grail
overall
i
liked
it
but
expected
better
i
will
try
again
but
i
would
like
to
try
it
fresher
i
dont
think
the
age
helped
it
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
bigger
and
more
complex
flavors
o
good
for
style
o
a
very
nice
stout
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
bright
roasted
coffee
notes
jump

yum
i
like
it
a
lot
great
with
chocolate
o
i
love
it
im
partial
to
stouts
especially
oatmeal
stouts
so
the
numbers
may
be
slightly
skewed
but
if
it
werent
a
good
stout
i
would
rate
it
low
so
take
it
at
as
it
is
because
of
the
coffeeespresso
notes
i
would
consider
this
a
great
dessert
beer
who
am
kidding
this
would
be
great
for
breakfast
or
anytime
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
short
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
nice
like
oatmeal
and
very
fresh

is
suprisingly
clean
and
fresh
without
any
heaviness
nice
and
crisp
and
clean
for
such
a
dark
beer
nice
carbonation
and
not
syrupy
like
other
darker
beers

really
enjoyed

another
great

fw
will
buy
some
more
o

a
nice
drinking
stout
with
good
flavors
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
ill
probably
stick
with
my
one
sixpack
per
season
o
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
the
beer
is
near
black
with
a
half
inch
of
beige
head
scents
of
bread
roast
chocolate
smooth
on
the
palate
flavors
include
char
roast
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
beans
easy
drinking
and
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
an
extremely
light
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
some
head
is
still
left
and
the
color
is
a
creamy
brown
color
the
beer
itself
is
an
opaque
dark
brown
that
is
a
little
bit
black
and
dark
the
beer
smell
has
strong
oatmeal
notes
and
dark
chocolate
notes
some
roasted
malt
smell
comes
out
but
not
much
the
oatmeal
smell
is
pretty
nice
and
oatmealy
the
beer
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
strong
creamy
oatmeal
notes
with
a
side
of
sweet
dark
chocolate
the
taste
also
has
an
interesting
slightly
metallic
water
taste
that
adds
to
the
eflavor
and
provides
a
nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
with
biting
carbonation
the
beer
feels
fairly
smooth
and
goes
down
smooth
as
well
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
one
worth
getting
again
overall
i
liked
the
beer
but
when
i
think
of
oatmeal
stout
i
always
think
about
smoothness
and
creamy
texture
this
beer
really
didnt
have
a
great
mouthfeel
and
brought
down
the
overall
score
more
than
mouthfeel
normally
does
i
really
dont
think
this
is
firestone
walkers
best
brews
poured
a
almost
black
body
with
khaki
head
that
left
some
pace
patches
smell
is
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
akin
to
some
coffee
and
chocolate
with
possible
nuts
hazel
or
toffee
maybe
caramel
the
oatmeal
is
noticeable
as
it
smoothes
down
a
light
bodied
beer
light
for
a
stout
and
helps
balance
a
light
coffeeroasted
malt
edge
with
some
minor
chocolate
and
toffee
like
sweetness
little
bit
of
woodiness
on
this
beer
as
well
and
at
times
there
seems
to
be
a
boozy
dry
finish
p
s
turns
out
this
is
a
late
springearly
summer
release
at
least
here
in
md
still
looking
for
some
easy
jack
and
opal
a
fairly
good
but
not
exceptional
brew
for
an
oatmeal
stout
i
would
rather
have
a
samuel
smiths
o
a
classic
example
of
a
beer
that
tastes
better
than
it
smells
its
not
amazing
but
it
works
nicely
enough
i
think
its
status
of
that
fw
beer
we
dont
get
on
the
east
coast
propped
it
up
too
high
on
my
pedestal
speaking
of
hey
fw
bring

to

right
now
jet
black
not
a
lot
of
head
going
on
here
very
roasted
nose
with
licorice
and
molasses
scents
up
front
first
sip
comes
across
very
smooth
big
time
oatmeal
graininess
dark
roast
coffee
anise
very
little
hop
bitterness
carbonation
is
appropriate
but
almost
seems
a
touch
too
much
a
little
smoother
would
have
been
nicer
all
in
all
a
good
oatmeal
stout
just
surprisingly
heavy
on
the
licorice
and
anise
undertones
pours
a
dark
coffee
black
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
relatively
fast
a
lot
of
roast
and
black
coffee
on
the
nose
with
subtle
chocolatey
undertones
the
taste
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
plenty
of
black
coffee
and
a
noticeable
oatmeal
presence
there
is
some
metallic
and
sour
presence
on
the
finish
but
this
is
not
unwelcome
this
is
a
really
smooth
stout
with
about
as
much
to
offer
as
an
oatmeal
stout
needs
to
offer
probably
the
best
basic
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
wonderful
oatmeal
stout
with
a
sense
of
chewy
depth
and
big
aromas
would
like
to
grab
this
guy
in
the
style
often
but
its
never
around
these
parts
glad
to
finally
get
my
hands
on
this
one
overall
a
local
cask
conditioned
stout
in
southern
california
what
a
treat
if
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
character
i
would
have
given
it
fives
across
the
board
the
velvet
merlin
poured
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
with
a
slight
tan
but
effervescent
head
the
aroma
held
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
roastiness
the
flavor
followed
suit
with
chocolate
toasted
malt
and
added
hints
of
coffee
it
left
a
slight
bitterness
on
my
palate
between
sips
but
the
roasted
chocolate
quickly
took
center
stage
the
bubbly
body
was
much
lighter
than
the
brews
appearance
and
was
light
and
lively
the
velvet
merlin
was
a
top
tier
oatmeal
stout
overall
nicely
crafted
oatmeal
stout
well
done
o
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
i
would
put
it
right
up
there
with
any
that
i
have
tried
so
far
overall
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
probably
my
favorite
style
and
this
is
an
excellent
one
very
easy
drinking
would
be
great
with
some
baby
back
ribs
love
the
sweetness
on
my
lips
after
every
drink
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
mindblowing
like
fws
hopforward
and
barrel
aged
beers
there
are
other
lowish
abv
stouts
that
i
would
likely
pick
up
off
the
shelf
before
i
reached
for
this
one
again
no
sign
of
oats
used
the
beer
is
much
too
crisp
thin
and
refreshing
for
an
oatmeal
stout
those
are
attributes
i
want
in
other
beer
styles
not
an
oatmeal
stout
o
theres
no
doubt
that
fw
knows
what
theyre
doing
and
this
beer
shows
well
the
excellent
control
they
have
at
the
time
of
brewing
overall
for
a
low
gravity
stout
this
is
not
bad
reminiscent
of
a
porter
with
hints
of
flavoring
but
not
really
my
definition
of
a
stout
pours
out
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
thin
head
smells
of
chocolate
raisins
and
lightly
burnt
toast
flavor
is
big
on
malts
dried
fruits
medium
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
fruity
esters
and
earthy
hops
finishes
really
dry
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
prickly
i
expected
fuller
from
an
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
really
solid
stout
if
it
were
a
little
lighter
in
alcohol
i
could
session
this
i
love
the
dryness
in
this
o
solid
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
good
session
stout
for
sure
i
could
easily
polish
of
a
few
of
these
o
solid
beer
for
someone
who
isnt
crazy
about
stouts
recommended
o
nothing
special
here
seems
like
a
typical
watery
stout
flavors
were
ok
the
smell
was
so
very
very
good
a
bit
disappointed
the
taste
did
not
match
o
really
good
oatmeal
stout
perfect
at
lunch
on
a
workday
o
pretty
good
with
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
showing
through
it
came
off
as
closer
to
raisins
with
loads
of
oakwood
notes
for
me
others
in
my
party
immediately
said
coffee
none
of
us
detected
any
chocolate
so
its
just
a
bit
darker
than
other
oatmeal
stouts
but
still
very
much
in
line
with
the
style
o
a
flavorful
and
easydrinking
stout
what
a
great
beer
super
awesome
taste
a
little
sweet
kind
of
roasty
malts
dark
fudge
as
the
last
guy
said
vanilla
and
honey
as
another
guy
said
milk
chocolate
what
an
awesome
taste
a
little
tang
on
the
finish
but
that
is
utterly
in
significant
considering
all
the
wonderful
flavors
going
on
with
this
brew
i
am
really
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
brew
i
had
the
merkin
and
the
sucaba
and
anniversary
etc
but
never
felt
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
and
i
regret
not
trying
it
sooner
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
thought
it
was
labeled
a
porter
but
it
says
stout
i
have
to
give
this
one
high
marks
for
every
category
i
wish
i
had
another
one
to
follow
this
one
up
right
now
o
overall
enjoyable
stout
bigger
beer
than
the
abv
would
indicate
super
thick
in
feel
and
a
bit
heavy
nice
with
dessert
features
the
usual
chocolate
and
roast
malt
flavors
but
the
mix
and
creamy
mouthfeel
just
makes
this
a
better
tasting
oatmeal
stout
mild
something
in
the
back
orange
mint
bigger
body
than
5
5
o
the
flavor
is
good
but
not
spectacular
or
overly
complex
i
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
off
for
the
style
and
detracts
from
the
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
not
a
world
class
beer
even
firestone
walker
hits
singles
sometimes
overall
really
good
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
balanced
really
well
and
nothing
is
overdone
flavor
wise
only
gripe
keeping
this
world
class
is
the
finish
is
a
little
watery
weak
still
solid
and
worth
a
drink
overall
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
rich
coffee
stout
as
opposed
to
an
oatmeal
stout
o
lighter
in
body
than
i
was
expecting
it
seems
better
suited
to
its
warmer
home
climate
than
the
dead
of
winter
here
in
the
northeast
where
a
more
robust
beer
is
often
preferred
still
a
good
beer
and
it
offers
enough
complexity
and
nuance
to
keep
it
from
feeling
boring
overall
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
nice
and
chewy
with
malty
complexity
great
brew
for
a
winters
day
i
will
look
for
this
in
bottles
a
great
beer
from
firestone
walker
that
gets
lost
amongst
their
other
bigger
beers
very
sessionable
with
tons
of
flavor
nice
and
chewy
body
with
that
oaty
bitterness
the
roasted
malts
has
a
dark
cocoa
flavor
and
a
bit
of
char
almost
in
the
favor
of
burnt
sugars
but
its
not
as
sweet
as
most
milk
stouts
it
still
has
a
bit
of
that
lacticity
in
the
way
that
some
coffees
have
a
higher
acidity
a
little
nutty
could
use
burlier
notes
carbonation
is
almost
ideal
but
perhaps
short
on
the
light
side
a
good
winter
stout
with
a
mild
hop
presence
odi
have
always
wanted
to
try
this
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
especially
having
velvet
merkin
first
its
a
nice
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
thats
it
though
a
very
tasty
beer
that
should
be
allowed
to
warm
so
the
flavors
can
expose
themselves
great
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
thick
and
flavorful
with
more
milk
chocolate
and
smooth
dark
malt
notes
dry
finish
but
maintains
a
quite
moderate
hop
presence
nicely
done
and
well
worth
a
try
if
ya
see
this
available
in
your
local
area
ogreat
taste
and
nice
balance
of
all
flavors
taste
was
very
one
dimensional
and
flat
i
got
nothing
but
roasted
bitter
notes
of
coffee
and
that
was
it
it
was
not
accompanied
by
any
sort
of
sweetness
like
chocolate
or
malt
it
was
just
coffee
water
residue
i
clearly
must
have
gotten
a
dud
because
i
see
this
is
rated
a
90
unless
im
crazy
or
the
world
is
crazy
this
was
not
a
good
beer
and
i
actually
poured
it
down
the
drain
after
about
10
sips
i
tried
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
2614
overall
probably
the
best
overall
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
so
far
very
well
put
together
and
really
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
firestone
seems
to
rarely
disappoint
d
a
rock
solid
oatmeal
stout
which
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
coming
from
firestone
walker
who
does
everything
not
world
class
but
way
better
than
average
highly
enjoyable
loaded
with
character
and
complexity
all
with
a
5
5
abv
bow
wrapped
around
all
components
work
well
together
and
the
end
result
is
a
brew
that
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
nicely
done
o
a
very
solid
offering
into
a
style
that
doesnt
always
bring
too
much
excitement
minus
the
imperial
and
ba
versions
very
drinkable
with
enough
complexity
to
satisfy
the
connoisseur
as
well
64oz

moderate

overall
decent
oatmeal
stout
id
buy
every
once
in
awhile
solid
oatmeal
stout
for
the
style
its
got
an
exceptional
nose
and
mouthfeel
the
flavour
profile
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
its
a
solid
seasonal
sixpack
from
firestone
walker
probably
the
first
one
from
them
ive
actually
enjoyed
overall
this
stout
does
not
have
much
flavor
its
some
what
harsh
but
does
try
to
end
with
a
smooth
mouth
expected
of
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
rather
decent
oatmeal
stout
overall
rather
drinkable
with
a
nice
coffee
flavor
this
is
not
an
imperial
so
that
must
be
taken
into
account
but
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
flavor
profile
overall
im
a
huge
oatmeal
stout
fan
and
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
it
all
smooth
roasted
chocolate
coffee
flavors
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
most
of
all
is
the
roasted
malt
flavors
and
aromas
that
stand
out
great
oatmeal
stout
and
one
of
my
winter
favorites
o
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
from
fw
the
coffee
chocolate
and
oats
mesh
incredibly
well
and
the
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
poured
into
a
dirty
but
rinsed
delirium
glass
medium
black
with
brown
head
that
fades
into
very
light
light
brown
lacing
and
dissipates
mediumsoon
tastes
like
an
old
shoe
in
a
good
way
dark
aged
fruit
dates
burnt
grain
with
a
high
drinkability
factor
alcohol
factors
too
prevalent
considering
the
only
5
5
and
thus
cuts
down
on
mouth
and
taste
smooth
and
balanced
but
not
too
excitable
if
one
was
to
drink
dark
ales
for
hours
and
hours
this
would
be
the
beer
goes
well
with
tobacco
and
chocolate
though
the
flavors
are
unremarkable
on
their
own
firestone
makes
very
solid
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
but
considering
it
could
be
much
better
o
another
potent
creation
from
firestone
that
is
delish
o
this
is
a
very
warming
stout
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
once
again
impressed
by
firestone
walker
o
a
nice
session
able
stout
o
good
flavors
with
some
complexity
but
nothing
that
amazes
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
but
not
a
flavor
explosion
like
many
others
in
this
spectrum
everything
clicks
here
inviting

impressive

delicious

abv
i
may
have
found
my
new
goto
session
brew
atmosphere
is
pretty
nice
slight
head
and
light
lacing
nose
is
roasty
and
malty
with
accentuates
of
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
like
it
smells
light
roasted
coffee
components
of
sweet
dark
chocolate
the
light
pungency
from
the
oatmeal
and
a
bit
of
bitter
well
balanced
collection
of
components
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
something
to
look
forward
to
each
year
o
great
stout
firestone
walker
doesnt
disappoint
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
will
most
definitely
get
again
o
a
great
beer
and
very
accessibly
priced
id
gladly
drink
this
all
winter
long
m
perfectly
smooth
minimal
carbonation
thick
very
warming
combines
with
a
great
balanced
flavor
profile
to
form
an
incredibly
nice
drinking
brew
follow
up
this
beer
gets
better
the
longer
it
sits
i
would
advise
pouring
it
and
just
letting
it
sit
then
just
when
you
are
ready
to
drink
it
let
it
sit
a
little
longer
it
becomes
more
flavorful
and
a
little
smoother
as
it
warms
first
review
on
here
though
far
from
my
first
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
linger
roasty
and
subtle
chocolate
aroma
significantly
thinner
body
than
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
experienced
heavy
roasted
malt
flavor
not
much
sweetness
weak
coffee
aftertaste
bitterness
from
hops
is
very
noticeable
but
no
hop
aroma
odd
bubbly
finish
if
you
like
roasty
stouts
this
may
be
your
thing
but
sadly
its
not
mine
o
3
75
its
a
good
oatmeal
stout
nothing
i
can
complain
about
too
much
if
i
could
change
it
id
want
it
a
little
bit
stronger
with
a
little
thicker
mouthfeel
bottle
courtesy
of
a
ba
trade
pours
inky
black
with
tan
colored
head
that
went
away
almost
immediately
good
legs
okay
lacing
aroma
is
faint
im
only
getting
deep
malt
with
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
taste
is
much
different
still
the
heavy
malt
character
interesting
oat
flavor
faint
hop
earthiness
brown
sugarcaramel
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
not
nearly
as
syrupy
as
i
was
hoping
for
from
a
oatmeal
centered
stout
im
surprised
this
beer
becomes
so
damn
tasty
in
the
barrels
merkin
is
considerably
better
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
aged
this
one
who
knows
o
great
beer
overall
very
impressed
wish
we
got
this
in
my
home
market
o
overall
a
well
done
brew
nothing
exceptional
about
this
one
but
tasty
and
certainly
worth
a
dry
a
decent
stout
nothing
special
the
biggest
downfall
in
the
flavor
department
is
the
bitter
and
acrid
finish
not
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
certainly
not
one
of
fws
better
year
rounds
o
not
bad
actually
well
made
and
good
just
not
very
memorable
o
a
decent
offering
from
firestone
walker
pretty
middle
of
the
road
stout
but
after
it
warms
up
and
it
gets
chilly
outside
not
too
bad
at
all
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
great
example
of
what
i
think
an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
not
overpowering
and
boozy
with
a
nice
lingering
afterthought
that
tells
you
that
you
just
enjoyed
a
fine
beer
cant
wait
to
try
the
barrel
aged
velvet
merkin
thanks
firestone
the
bourbon
barrel
influence
is
quite
subtle
in
the
aroma
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
of
bourbon
character
here
but
it
is
definitely
quite
reduced
from
velvet
merkin
in
the
flavor
it
is
soft
but
it
is
also
noticeable
i
do
like
that
it
was
kept
at
a
very
low
level
here
but
i
almost
feel
like
it
could
use
a
touch
more
as
i
almost
feel
like
it
is
too
subtle
that
can
be
a
dangerous
thing
though
as
i
definitely
prefer
that
the
barrel
character
be
kept
fairly
low
still
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
is
something
i
am
quite
happy
to
have
a
6pack
of
the
6
99
price
doesnt
hurt
either
the
extra
boost
of
smooth
complexity
from
the
bourbon
barrel
really
adds
something
to
this
beer
overall
i
would
have
it
again
though
likely
wont
be
scouring
the
shelfs
for
it
velvet
merlin
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
all
around
but
it
really
wasnt
a
mindblowing
or
incredible
experience
for
me
and
there
are
certainly
some
options
that
are
more
local
to
me
that
id
take
over
it
new
hollands
the
poet
or
even
rogues
shakespeare
as
much
as
i
hate
rogue
and
their
business
practices
but
thats
neither
here
nor
there
really
good
but
not
legendary
o
taste
doesnt
follow
aroma
enough
but
its
an
average
oatmeal
stout
id
look
elsewhere
for
cheaper
and
better
oat
stouts
overall
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
very
enjoyable
and
i
highly
recommend
it
o
this
is
the
definition
if
a
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
packed
with
flavor
but
so
very
well
balanced
i
could
drink
6
of
these
in
a
given
night
another
solid
beer
from
fw
the
flavor
profile
is
acceptable
if
unremarkable
the
problem
lies
in
the
exceedingly
thin
mouthfeel
and
excessive
carbonation
both
of
which
go
contrary
to
everything
i
look
for
in
a
stout
its
almost
like
drinking
a
stoutflavored
soft
drink
and
i
say
this
as
one
who
has
great
respect
for
firestone
walker
and
had
high
expectations
for
this
brew
its
drinkable
but
far
from
what
i
was
hoping
for
light
and
thin
does
not
an
oatmeal
stout
make
overall
i
am
impressed
it
drinks
better
than
my
all
time
favorite
anderson
valley
oatmeal
stout
yet
its
around
the
same
abv
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
at
a
case
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
it
up
o
my
favorite
oatmeal
stou
firestone
makes
good
beer
and
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorites
this
can
be
consumed
in
the
summer
or
winter
i
could
drink
one
on
a
cold
rainy
night
in
a
pub
or
on
the
beach
at
a
barbecue
nice
all
around
beer
velvety
smooth
mouth
the
oats
do
what
they
do
best
really
mellowing
this
beer
out
sweet
chocolate
kiss
dry
bark
like
taste
finish
of

cream
really
a
good
beer
a
wellmade
treat
that
is
another
id
love
to
see
around
this
area
oh
well
thanks
for
the
bottle
ed
poured
into
a
forestinne
branded

dark
as
shit
like
motor

with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
few
sips
decent
lacing
smell
is
smoky
and
earthy
faint
scent
of
hops
fresh
milled
grain
dark
chocolate
and
iced

is
much
more
bright
and
interesting
than
the
nose
suggests
plum
burnt

earthy
roasted

vanilla
sweet
toffee
cocoa
nibs
slight
hint
of
fresh

grass
absolutely
delicious
medium
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
for
the
style
smooth
and
creamy
extremely
easy
drinker
for
a
stout
overall
amazing
stout
that
as
mentioned
drinks
ridiculously
easy
could
crush
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
no
problem
the
smell
is
good
overall
but
a
does
of
phenols
is
getting
in
the
way
a
touch
too
strong
to
meld
in
with
the
better
flavors
malts
are
more
roasted
than
i
like
in
an
oatmeal
stout
yet
this
beer
comes
up
a
little
thin
when
compared
to
the
non
oatmeal
variety
i
think
it
is
a
line
sitter
than
cannot
quite
decide
what
it
wants
to
be
still
a
tasty
effort
overall
definitely
smooth
and
drinkable

nice

extremely

a
very
enjoyable
offering
never
really
cared
for
this
one
before
always
had
a
hint
of
dull
dry
bitter
but
tonight
i
opened
one
thats
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
and
the
hint
above
is
not
there
its
picked
up
a
hint
of
chocolatelicorice
and
its
creamy
much
nicer
feel
than
before
tonight
was
straight
from
the
bottle
but
in
the
past
poured
in
a
glass
color
is
typical
dark
one
ill
revist
o
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
thats
incredibly
drinkable
well
balanced
while
showcasing
the
roasted
malts
and
oats
without
interruption
o
i
believe
the
label
had
a
best
by
or
bottled
on
date
of
dec
2012
might
explain
some
of
the
oxidized
flavors
if
the
former
either
way
one
of
the
more
solid
somewhat
more
authentic
takes
on
this
style
ive
come
across
i
could
drink
it
again
o
a
perfect
summer
stout
easy
to
sip
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
while
grilling
i
always
sit
in
a
position
at
the
bar
where
i
can
get
a
perfect
view
of
this
one
betting
poured
i
love
the
tan
head
not
as
dark
and
sexy
as
kbs
but
it
is
just
right
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
takes
me
back
to
my
childhood
when
i
used
to
eat
halfmelted
ice
cream
with
a
spork
from
the
paleta
man
i
often
imagine
myself
eating
velvet
merlin
with
a
spork
the
aroma
is
not
immediately
prominent
until
you
take
a
drink
that
thick
head
keeps
it
all
in
you
inhale
slightly
when
you
drink
too
right
of
course
you
do
i
enjoy
the
aroma
and
the
taste
very
close
together
with
this
one
almost
at
once
it
is
nutty
chocolatey
caramely
roasty
and
malty
and
all
in
a
perfect
balance
not
one
exceeding
the
other
like
a
group
of
sexy
women
walking
abreast
towards
you
in
slow
motion
for
me
fuggles
is
a
funny
name
for
hops
i
get
taken
to
another
place
when
im
enjoying
this
outstanding
beer
it
is
unfortunate
that
it
is
not
available
year
round
see
you
again
in
the
fall
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
thick
tan
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
mild
aroma
of
roast
grain
and
cocoa
flavor
is
stronger
but
similar
with
moderate
roastiness
and
cocoa
powder
very
thin
for
a
stout
mouthfeel
and
dry
finish
the
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
but
i
was
very
disappointed
by
the
thin
mouthfeel
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
the
thickness
and
smooth
flow
that
one
expects
from
an
oatmeal
stout
carbonation
is
of
medium
to
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
gently
foamy
slightly
mediumheavy
overall
mouthfeel
well
suited
for
the
beer
and
the
style
closes
quite
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
lingering
upon
the
palate
and
lips
othis
is
a
decent
smelling
and
tasting
brew
but
i
feel
let
down
by
the
completely
lackluster
appearance
and
mediocre
feel
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
thin
and
watery
is
not
how
i
prefer
my
oatmeal
stouts
i
am
also
surprised
by
how
this
beers
flavor
profile
blossomed
at
65
degrees
in
other
words
this
beer
is
something
of
an
enigma
for
me
its
not
an
easy
beer
to
brew
because
the
balance
between
malt
sweetness
hop
bitterness
and
dark
malt
acidity
is
so
important
yet
firestone
walker
has
pulled
it
off
quite
nice
o
overall
a
beautiful
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
that
is
definitely
on
the
chocolatey
side
of
things
another
great
beer
from
firestone
and
a
fills
a
needed
gap
in
the
sessionable
american
stout
arena
o
this
big
black
malt
flavor
is
nice
with
some
inky
qualities
but
the
finish
and
body
really
get
thin
a
lot
as
it
opens
up
and
there
isnt
much
to
support
that
big
malt
flavor
it
would
be
nice
to
have
some
alcohol
or
hops
or
sweetness
to
finish
what
the
flavor
starts
o
was
hoping
for
a
thicker
feel
coming
from
an
oatmeal
also
the
smokiness
caught
me
a
little
off
guard
but
in
a
good
way
i
like
smoke
a
nice
and
solid
beer
but
nothing
too
extraordinary
pours
a
dark
deep
near
black
moderate
cap
of
grayish
tinted
tan
froth
scent
is
dark
roasty
with
some
ash
and
char
notes
of
spent
coffee
grinds
bitter
cocoa
some
leafy
hops
thrown
in
and
a
touch
of
dark
berries
taste
follows
scent
dark
and
roasty
coffee
grains
cocoa
leafy
hops
dark
berry
expected
a
bit
more
body
and
smoothness
from
style
decent
oatmeal
stout
doesnt
wow
in
any
particular
way
overall
this
one
is
a
winner
i
definitely
recommend
grabbing
a
few
bottles
if
you
can
find
it
it
doesnt
rank
up
there
with
some
of
the
great
imperial
stouts
but
its
certainly
one
of
the
best
sessionable
stouts
out
there
o
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
an
unassuming
beer
o
balanced
but
generally
unimpressive
for
firestone
no
particular
flavor
is
overwhelming
present
not
velvety
smooth
as
i
would
expect
an
oatmeal
stout
to
be
very
dark
but
a
clear
cola
color
against
the
light
with
a
thin
tan
head
with
decent
retention
lots
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
with
a
slight
roasted
coffee
tinge
caramel
also
plays
a
vital
role
flavor
is
very
chocolatey
also
but
dry
like
bakers
chocolate
and
bitter
as
well
caramel
and
somewhat
sweet
like
chocolate
milk
this
finishes
with
earthy
hop
bitterness
feel
is
somewhat
creamy
would
like
more
cream
ad
thin
finish
is
very
dry
interesting
but
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
then
again
im
not
one
to
enjoy
most
oatmeal
stouts
could
fit
the
profile
better
o
delicious
oatmeal
stout
very
roasted
looks
and
feels
fantastic
this
is
quite
the
clean
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
no
surprise
from
firestone
walker
i
would
definitely
seek
this
out
i
get
other
firestone
walker
beers
and
i
hope
this
eventually
makes
it
to
the
east
coast
as
this
is
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
oits
a
great
flavor
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
creamier
though
and
less
dry
i
think
itd
be
perfect
via
nitro
definitely
something
id
recommend
anyone
to
try
the
burnt
malt
dominates
here
which
i
like
its
a
top
stout
o
wow
just
a
fantastic
beer
huge
flavor
and
feel
for
a
low
abv
beer
onice
addition
in
the
lighter
stout
category
and
at
5
5
abv
you
cant
go
wrong
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
underwhelming
compared
to
the
nose
too
much
carbonation
and
not
nearly
enough
flavor
oeasy
drinking
with
solid
flavor
could
see
this
as
a
regular
a
very
solid
stout
i
especially
appreciate
the
modest
abv
and
robust
flavor
o
great
beer
worth
getting
if
you
can
get
it
d
the
low
abv
means
you
could
drink
more
than
one
if
you
were
so
inclined
not
sure
id
be
having
more
than
one
or
two
the

wqalker
velvet
stout
is
good
the
beer
pours
an
opaque

thin
almost
nonexistent

that
is
leaving
a
very
spotty
lace
the
smell
carries
waffs
of

the
taste
carry
a
nice

burst
with
good
coffee
and
roast
the
mouthfeel
is

overall
it
is
a
great
session
stout
perfect
for
a

velvet
merlin
is
good
not
great
firestone
has
brewed
a
very
drinkable
though
simple
and
mild
stout
i
prefer
my
stouts
to
be
a
bit
bolder
i
know
some
people
weirdos
all
that
would
prefer
this
approach
but
if
youre
an
oatmeal
stout
aficionado
maybe
youll
find
virtues
in
velvet
merlin
my
palate
doesnt
appreciate
as
well
my
own
stylistic
preferences
asides
i
do
think
this
is
still
a
very
respectable
beer
even
if
its
not
by
any
means
a
show
stopper
o
a
pretty
good
effort
more
sessionable
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
than
others
ive
had
i
do
like
them
stouter
though
ipswich
outdoes
this
one
imo
o
good
not
great
oatmeal
stout
typical
flavors
nothing
outstanding
for
a
seasonal
release
and
an
oatmeal
stout
the
abv
should
be
higher
osome
really
nice
sweet
malt
character
tastes
like
a
robust
brown
ale
missing
some
of
the
characters
i
like
in
a
stout
from
notes
opaque
darkbrown
with
highlighting
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
aroma
unlike
the
flavor
was
fantastic
there
are
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
roasty
malt
dry
oak
and
a
wellbalanced
bourbon
flavor
that
meshed
very
well
unlike
some
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
the
taste
had
all
of
these
flavors
but
they
were
far
more
muted
the
bourbon
flavor
became
almost
watery
the
feel
may
have
been
the
real
culprit
it
was
much
too
thin
for
a
stout
much
less
a
barrelaged
stout
a
cask
would
likely
bring
out
the
creamy
lush
mouthfeel
of
the
oatmeal
stout
at
any
rate
it
was
still
a
good
beer
and
they
get
points
for
not
overwhelming
a
relatively
small
stout
with
bourbon
barrelaging
would
be
nice
to
see
it
in
a
cask

this

knows
how
to
streamline

good

beer
drinks
like
an
oatmeal
stout
but
ultimately
disappointing
lots
of
burnt
ashy
and
raw

flavors
get
collected
on
the
palate
before
a
nice
coffee
bitterness
and
drying
take
over
fw
makes
great
beers
but
this
is
closer
to
the
bottom
of
their
list
o
decent
oatmeal
stout
inexpensive
and
overall
tasty
this
is
an
excellent
stout
with
a
great
nose
and
wonderful
flavor
however
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
more
oatmealy
and
a
bit
smoother
it
is
a
solid
beer
and
for
the
price
it
is
hard
to
beat
perhaps
if
i
could
try
it
on
tap
i
would
enjoy
it
more
normally
i
enjoy
everything
i
have
by
firestone
walker
velvet

pours
dark
w

i
like
to
swirl
half
the
unpoured
stout
before
pouring
the
rest
in

to
give
it
more
bang
smells
wonderful
coffee
and
chocolate
dominate
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
certainly
not
creamy
or
velvety
tastes
pretty
good
though
like
how
it
smells
in
addition
to
coffee
and
chocolate
theres
a
hint
of
caramel
note
and
slight
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
2
bottles
go
down
like
water
love
it
with
dark
chocolate
covered
pretzels
the
stout
tastes
more
complex
after
o
i
compensated
a
bit
with
the
taste
score
because
this
beer
should
get
a
100
out
of
5
on
the
mouthfeel
and
i
cant
do
that
one
of
my
top
20
and
maybe
the
best
value
in
that
respect
i
can
get
six
of
these
for
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
price
of
some
of
the
others
ive
tried
that
are
better
get
a
six
pack
when
its
available
if
you
like
smooth
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
the
best
of
its
style
well
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
velvet
merkin
is
a
little
better
the
verdict
very
good
bursting
with
roasted
malt
flavor
but
less
bitter
than
many
oatmeal
stouts
the
smoothest
stout
with
big
flavor
that
ive
ever
had
the
only
stout
i
like
better
than
obsidian
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
it
is
exceptional
buy
all
you
can
find
do
very
drinkable
and
certainly
repeatable
4

o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
here
drank
this
beer
the
night
i
asked
my
wifes
folks
if
i
could
marry
their
daughter
haha
not
too
sweet
here
all
the
flavors
complement
each
other
nicely
without
allowing
one
to
become
to
overbearing
sweet
bitter
toasted
faintness
of
alcohol
to
name
a
few
a
great
stout
overall
highly
recommended
indeed
this
beer
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
became
a
stout
drinker
last
evening
yet
again
i
came
to
know
just
why
i
love
this
beer
it
taste
toward
the
front
is
a
sharp
espresso
coffee
taste
and
finishes
with
hints
of
chocolate
malt
and
cream
one
of
the
best
ways
to
enjoy
beer
on
a
winters
evening
is
with
a
stout
like
this
in
your
hand
would
highly
recommend
pure
black
stout
with
one
thumb
of
creamy
tan
head
coffee
and
cocoa
dominate
the
nose
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
maybe
a
touch
of
toffee
as
well
lightly
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
creamy
velvety
texture
very
pleasing
pretty
full
bodied
has
a
fairly
dry
finish
very
nice
stout
o
goes
down
easy
very
tasty
somewhat
filling
low
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
delicious
beer
if
youre
of
the
stout
persuasion
i
was
in
socal
and
still
in
the
stout
spirit
which
was
hard
to
find
at
bars
there
definitely
one
i
would
hit
up
on
the
regular
back
home
poured
from
tap
into
nonic
pint
at
freshcraft
in
lodo
pours
a
slightly
ambered
deep
brown
with
thin
head
nice
roasted
malt
and
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
really
bold
roasted
malts
coffee
bourbon
like
and
somewhat
sweet
nicely
balanced
its
sweet
but
has
a
bitter
finish
its
bold
but
light
and
airy
without
being
over
heavy
such
a
great
brew
o
gem
from
firestone
great
beer
and
great
price

a
sixer
these
guys
can
make
beer
great
aftertaste
and
overall
if
im
looking
for
a
drinkable
stout
that
isnt
barrel
aged
or
fancy
i
think
ive
found
it
having
not
tried
the
merkin
i
cant
compare
yet
tldr
highly
drinkable
and
respectable
stout
entry
i
would
definitely
love
to
try
it
on
nitro
m
very
creamy
and
smooth
coating
the
palate
with
incredible
stride
this
is
where
the
beer
excels
in
my
opinion
exactly
the
way
an
oatmeal
stout
should
feel
o
a
really
tasty
beer
i
wonder
if
this
was
midadvertised
and
is
actually
the
5
nonbourbon
aged
version
i
would
have
liked
this
to
be
much
more
bold
and
the
flavors
to
be
much
more
prominent
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
tasted
like
a
watereddown
version
of
what
i
expected
it
was
advertised
as
velvet
merlin
8
7
bourbon
aged
i
think
it
was
just
the
normal
5er
that
they
bottle
overall
this
is
about
as
much
bang
for
your
abv
as
you
are
going
to
find
in
a
beer
at
5
5
it
is
rich
big
and
filling
it
drinks
more
like
an
810er
o
a
great
smooth
stout
for
the
cold
winter
nights
simple
and
balanced
with
good
drinkability
o
as
previously
stated
this
brew
lacks
complexity
but
it
makes
up
for
it
in
its
balance
there
is
a
bit
more
of
a
body
to
this
one
than
other
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
which
is
always
a
plus
in
my
book
decent
beer
all
the
way
around
but
nothing
to
get
to
get
excited
about
i
recommend
this
beer
if
it
is
distributed
to
your
area
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
by
fw
especially
for
its
budget
offering
i
could
definitely
have
more
of
these
due
to
its
rich
fullbodied
experience
at
such
a
good
price
great
stuff
by
fw
and
i
could
definitely
have
more
o
from
look
to
feel
a
textbook
oatmeal
stout
that
seems
to
border
on
a
milk
stout
at
times
i
enjoyed
it
overall
great
beer
pleasantly
flavorful
and
drinkable
for
being
a
lighter
brew
especially
at
5
5
definitely
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
must
try
in
my
opinion
sets
the
new
standard
for
an
oatmeal
stout
roasty
and
smooth
it
makes
me
hungry
and
thats
what
it
should
do
malted
goodness
layered
with
chocolate
and
happiness
o
its
decent
im
definitely
a
little
disappointed
as
fs
usually
delivers
its
not
bad
but
not
great
as
a
nonbourbon
barrel
aged
oatmeal
stout
this
is
excellent
and
more
in
line
with
what
i
expect
from
fw
not
the
disappointment
when
i
expected
it
to
be
a
merkin
deleted
my
merkin
review
overall
i
like
firestone
and
this
was
a
decent
attempt
but
the
brew
lacks
the
follow
through
i
feel
it
ought
to
have
i
dont
see
myself
getting
up
for
another
bottle
overall
decent
not
sure
why
such
a
high
average
score
i
decided
to
go
ahead
and
have
a
few
tonight
though
usually
stouts
arent
my
favorite
type
of
beer
and
wow
these
were
much
better
than
i
expected
usually
i
prefer
reds
and
other
dark
ales
but
these
ones
really
are
fantastic
this
beer
has
a
smooth
rich
flavor
and
after
my
fourth
one
im
still
enjoying
the
taste
of
it
id
love
to
try
this
in
a
recipe
to
see
how
it
affects
baked
goods
this
is
a
spectacular
oatmeal
stout
sweet
creamy
and
easy
drinking
huge
coffee
notes
and
nuttiness
the
partial
blend
from
the
bourbon
barrels
make
this
really
nice
o
excellent
oatmeal
stout
a
flavorful
blend
of
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
a
true
delight
d
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
with
a
really
good
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
there
dont
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
them
out
there
to
try
really
nice
toasted
and
malty
smoked
tones
that
stay
consistent
been
a
while
since
ive
gotten
a
nose
like
this
that
i
can
remember
smooth
well
constructed
even
i
like
it
wooo
this
is
a
great
stout
black
body
with
a
thick
head
roasty
chocolately
aroma
and
flavor
ultra
creamy
nay
velvety
mouthfeel
that
just
slides
down
your
throat
this
brewery
is
on
the
rise
and
for
good
reason
every
new
brew
from
these
guys
gets
me
excited
and
they
deliver
a
surprisingly
large
amount
of
the
time
the
beer
is
a
dark
color
oatmeal
stout
with
a
small
head
a
bit
of
a
tobacco
or
coffee
flavor
was
the
one
thing
that
stood
out
to
me
i
love
dark
beer
and
the
taste
was
pleasing
the
signs
claim
firestone
is
3x
brewery
of
the
year
i
can
see
why
this
one
i
was
unfamiliar
with
but
velvet
merlin
instantly
appeared
in
my
top
5

from

flavorful
low

and
drinkable
overall
first
time
having
this
beer
and
its
my
favorite
firestone
brew
to
date
classic
oatmeal
stout
flavors
but
big
bold
and
beautifully
balanced
definitely
a
future
buy
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
maybe
not
as
great
as
anderson
valleys
but
stil
pretty
good
o
very
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
of
tried
it
a
little
fresher
since
it
was
bottled
12412
but
still
good
enough
to
get
a
feel
for
what
it
is
pretty
solid
while
nothing
earth
shattering
here
its
hard
not
to
be
impressed
with
a
beer
showing
this
much
flavor
with
such
low
alcohol
pretty
impressive
really
if
youre
wondering
about
the
name
change
velvet
merlin
was
formally
called
velvet
merkin
they
got
into
some
pr
trouble
google
merkin
and
youll
see
why
so
they
avoided
the
hassle
and
changed
it
to
merlin
i
was
up
at
the
brewpub
in
paso
robles
some
weeks
ago
and
theyve
named
another
beer
velvet
merkin
a
sortof
big
brother
to
the
merlin
i
think
it
was
the
merlin
barrelaged
but
i
could
be
wrong
and
i
dont
feel
like
looking
it
up
right
now
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
for
a
low
abv
oatmeal
stout
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
this
is
widely
available
here
in
san
diego
and
its
become
a
sort
of
sessionstout
for
me
smooth
and
toasty
and
tasty
o
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
way
too
dry
decent
flavor
both
this
and
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
too
chalky
overall
the
appearance
of
this
beer
once
poured
was
really
great
a
beautiful
fluffyrockyfoamy
head
oh
ya
it
tasted
pretty
good
too
although
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
available
to
me
locally
o
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
recommended
would
have
again
drinkable
smooth
and
pleasant
cheers
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
one
that
i
will
certainly
seek
out
again
quite
tasty
beer
takes
on
typical
stout
form
black
with
tan
head
which
doesnt
retain
to
describe
it
more
i
have
no
claim
smell
is
fairly
faint
in
the
form
of
the
following
facets
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
however
these
characteristics
are
quite
bold
and
is
best
served
not
too
cold
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
velvet
merlin
seems
full
bodied
but
by
alcohol
volume
its
nary
as
such
i
would
imagine
quite
a
night
drinking
six
of
these
and
not
dehydrate
or
overindulge
velvet
merlin
a
single
strength
stout
i
can
easily
afford
o
good
stout
but
to
me
is
more
like
a
milk
than
a
oatmeal
none
the
less
still
worth
trying
o
damn
this
beer
had
an
excellent
nose
the
flavors
and
body
are
just
above
average
for
me
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
though
its
a
nice
and
simple
oatmeal
stout
that
does
everything
right
it
doesnt
stand
out
but
its
a
safe
bet
o
would
absolutely
buy
again
love
this
beer
d
good
to
try
lots
of
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
its
mediumbodied
and
pretty
dry
its
somewhat
reminiscent
of
samuel
smiths
os
but
without
the
nice
creamy
sweetness
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
a
bit
dry
for
my
palate
and
therefore
is
far
from
the
best
os
ive
had
i
expect
more
creaminess
in
this
style
taste
is
straightforward
with
all
your
basic
stout
flavors
and
hints
of
oatmeal
medium
bodied
but
definitely
too
thin
for
the
style
an
oatmeal
stout
really
needs
more
body
a
nice
stout
overall
but
give
me
breakfast
stout
instead
please
overall
solid
stout
some
rich
flavors
but
kept
in
line
by
punchy
bitterness
more
depth
of
flavor
than
the
usual
5
5
abv
american
stout
further
underscoring
the
skill
of
firestone
walkers
brewers
despite
the
slightly
disappointing
mouthfeel
its
a
quality
stout
well
worth
sampling
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
silky
smooth
and
easysipping
the
body
is
a
bit
light
but
that
does
not
seem
to
affect
its
ability
to
transfer
flavors
this
also
helps
to
prevent
the
beer
from
being
sticky
or
coating
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
fizzy
but
does
not
seem
to
interfere
with
the
experience
and
creates
an
excellent
swallow
a
very
unimposing
tasty
stout
awesome
oatmeal
stout
smokey
quality
is
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
a
couple
5s
poured
a
dark
brownblack
nearly
opaque
with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
patchy
layer
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
heavy
with
roast
coffee
dark
malts
underlying
cocoa
more
roast
on
the
taste
oatmeal
and
toasted
grains
coffee
cocoa
roasty
bitterness
with
a
definite
sugary
sweetness
in
the
background
mediumbodied
creamy
but
still
a
bit
on
the
lightwatery
side
for
the
style
and
not
as
completely
balanced
as
it
should
be
still
very
good
though
and
quite
drinkable
overall
overall
it
is
very
medium
bodied
and
pleasant
i
like
it
but
not
an
exceptional
stout
by
any
means
d
very
chocolaty
like
having
a
large
bite
of
your
favorite
chocolate
ice
cream
you
can
mention
yours
mine
is
ben
jerrys
yummy
beer
well
rounded
starts
out
dominating
with
the
smokiness
and
finishes
the
same
way
no
complex
flavors
but
definitely
a
very
good
beer
just
a
bit
flat
in
parts
but
other
than
that
great
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
my
first
oatmeal
stout
i
had
was
samuel
smiths
and
this
beer
is
very
much
comparable
to
it
it
has
a
nice
rich
flavor
and
its
low
alcohol
makes
it
very
drinkable
on
tap
at
the
cordova
casino
in
rancho
cordova
it
accompanied
one
of
the
shittiest
meals
ive
had
in
eons
a
nastyass
chicken
fettucine
alfredo
i
should
have
my
head
examined
for
having
a
stout
with
white
sauce
but
the
mismatch
isnt
responsible
for
the
boyardee
impression
of
the
noodles
anyway
this
review
is
not
about
the
noodles
its
about
the
beer
and
what
a
beer
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
roasty
and
subtle
vanilla
flavors
with
a
fantabulous
sureally
smooth
consistency
much
better
than
fws
porter
really
makes
me
want
to
try
parabola
m
super
creamy
a
bright
and
crisp
middle
that
flows
around
and
helps
disrupt
the
creamy
nature
so
it
isnt
syrupy
or
gross
the
carbonation
sometimes
breaks
things
up
too
much
full
bodied
finish
is
a
good
amount
of
sticky
nothing
bothersome
great
texture
if
you
happen
to
come
across
this
limited
edition
stout
i
would
grab
a
few
this
is
definately
worth
having
and
cannot
find
one
reason
why
this
should
not
be
a
big
contender
pours
thickish
black
with
a
slow
dissipating
creamy
head
the
taste
is
akin
to
the
st
ambroise
highlighting
the
bitterness
bulked
up
mouthfeel
though
still
good
drinkability
leaving
a
moderate
dry
and
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
malty
and
roast
aroma
trace
of
bourbon
does
not
add
but
subtracts
cheers
o
this
is
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
low
abv
and
good
flavor
maybe
a
little
less
bitterness
and
id
have
rated
higher
but
still
very
very
good
from
fw
cost
2
for
a
12
oz
bottle
nice
little
number
here
feels
like
moderate
abv
stouts
are
becoming
less
less
visible
glad
to
see
a
fullflavored
wellcomposed
oatmeal
stout
wish
we
got
this
in
my
area
more
regularly
spot
on
oatmeal
stout
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
this
brew
i
picked
up
just
by
chance
i
have
enjoyed
several
other
firestone
walker
brews
so
i
figured
this
one
would
be
pretty
good
too
it
poured
out
as
a
very
dark
black
color
with
a
nice
looking
creamy
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
very
nice
on
this
also
the
aroma
was
lightly
roasted
but
nothing
too
strong
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
it
has
a
soft
roasted
flavor
to
it
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
i
can
see
myself
getting
this
again
worth
trying
for
sure
d
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
going
for
it
cheers
a
tinny
roasted
barley
and
coffee
bitterness
up
front
palate
fills
in
with
semisweet
chocolate
hearty
soda
bread
licorice
peat
wood
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
finish
features
lingering
chocolate
sweetness
with
minor
notes
of
espresso
and
cream
think
latte
mediumfull
body
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
very
nice
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
highly
recommended
chewy
full
body
with
a
deeply
roasted
dark
malt
character
thats
nicely
countered
by
a
subtle
earthy
hop
presence
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
flavor
that
never
becomes
overpowering
or
burnt
tasting
strong
dark
chocolate
oatmeal
and
coffee
bean
presence
along
with
some
caramel
toffee
and
lactic
cream
very
complex
and
even
though
its
full
bodied
its
very
well
balanced
resulting
in
an
extremely
quaffable
beer
poured
into
my
sa
pint
glass
pitch
black
darker
than
most
oatmeal
stouts
ive
encountered
with
an
inch
or
so
of
dense
tan
head
smell
is
dominantly
coffee
with
a
nice
fudgey
chocolate
background
subtle
hopping
the
taste
is
like
a
mocha
kind
of
flavor
nice
french
roast
coffee
sort
of
flavor
with
the
semisweet
dark
chocolate
fudge
i
smelled
earlier
kind
of
pick
up
on
a
chestnut
flavor
very
smooth
earthy
roasted
and
nutty
flavors
are
complimented
nicely
with
slightly
floral
hops
that
arent
too
bitter
or
resiny
the
feel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
at
first
not
very
dense
as
the
smell
and
flavors
would
suggest
but
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
it
became
thicker
highly
drinkable
and
very
tasty
beer
overall
so
far
i
have
not
been
disappointed
with
firestone
walker
velvet
merlin
just
made
its
way
into
regular
rotation
with
me
another
good
offering
from
firestone
walker
well
hidden
alcohol
and
light
enough
to
have
more
than
one
this
was
quite
a
robust
and
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
with
a
good
bit
of
well
balanced
flavor
that
didnt
skimp
on
the
oatmeal
character
one
bit
im
not
sure
if
this
one
is
making
distribution
yet
on
the
east
coast
but
its
definitely
one
that
im
going
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
o
i
love
how
drinkable
this
is
the
aroma
and
body
didnt
knock
me
out
but
the
clean
crisp
flavors
are
incredibly
attractive
nice
work
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
doa
overall
very
pleased
with
this
beer
great
balance
smooth
finish
and
a
delicious
taste
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
a
little
on
the
mild
and
sweet
side
i
slightly
preferred
the
slow
elk
by
big
sky
which
is
very
similar
the
medium
to
thin
body
and
lively
but
not
prickly
carbonation
also
put
me
more
in
mind
of
a
porter
than
an
oatmeal
stout
although
the
creaminess
of
the
body
is
fitting
to
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
definitely
right
up
my
alley
and
would
find
a
regular
spot
in
my
fridge
along
side
union
jack
if
it
made
it
to
stores
over
here
this
is
a
jazzy
morgana
king
type
of
beer
velvety
and
softspoken
yet
deeply
sexy
more
to
the
traditional
side
all
polish
and
depth
overall
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
disappointing
pours
a
deep
brown
out
of
the
bottle
sitting
almost
black
in
the
glass
the
head
is
small
and
tan
leaving
streaks
of
lacing
aroma
is
mainly
toasted
chocolate
malt
and
oatmeal
there
are
hints
of
coffee
and
cocoa
powder
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
predominantly
chocolate
with
bitter
espresso
with
a
healthy
dose
of
oatmeal
in
finish
to
make
it
very
creamy
the
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
feels
a
tad
thin
though
it
is
a
low
abv
stout
this
is
a
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
wouldnt
have
threw
in
my
other
one
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
that
being
said
i
would
like
to
see
the
carbos
pumped
up
a
bit
as
well
as
an
increase
in
head
size
for
appearance
purposes
i
also
think
its
a
bit
thin
giving
a
washed
down
feel
as
stated
previous
i
would
drink
this
beer
many
more
times
and
with
glee
overall
a
very
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
kudos
on
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
the
most
impressive
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
but
up
there
great
job
velvet

one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
other
than
the
velvet
merkin

which
is
only
served
at
the
brewery
the
difference
is
merkin
is
age
longer
in
bourbon
barrels
which
gives
it
an
higher
abv
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
and
great
oak
bourbon
smell
pours
an
opaque

with

an
oatmeal

the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth

tastes
roasty
and
even
a
bit
chocolatey
solid
example
of
the

the
oats
lending
to
the

cheers
beertracker
overall
fairly
interesting
brew
to
think
about
while
tasting
and
a
decent
taste
in
and
of
itself
o
all
over
the
board
here
on
the
notes
definitely
a
great
brew
dont
get
me
wrong
and
i
payed
5
bucks
for
a
six
pack
of
it
so
i
am
not
complaining
id
be
really
interested
to
see
how
this
is
on
tap
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
it
is
complex
and
tasty
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
not
imperialized
which
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
neglected
concept
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
roast
and
a
small
sweetness
in
the
taste
sweet
cocoa
and
a
light
roast
a
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
cocoa
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
across
the
board
nothing
really
exciting
nice
but
boring
o
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
while
i
did
enjoy
velvet
merkin
much
better
i
still
think
this
is
a
really
good
beer
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
nothing
super
complex
or
complicated
but
well
balanced
and
tasty
i
dont
always
need
to
be
blown
away
by
a
beer
i
sometimes
just
need
a
really
good
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
a
few
off
this
beer
fits
that
oreally
good
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
if
i
am
ever
somewhere
they
have
this
i
will
pick
some
up
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
anything
worth
seeking
out
if
you
havent
tried
it
and
you
want
to
give
it
a
shot
i
wouldnt
dissuade
you
but
i
wouldnt
persuade
you
to
try
this
beer
over
another
oatmeal
stout
of
the
same
quality
and
price
meh
o
very
amazingly
drinkable
beer
good
taste
very
good
beer
o
a
really
excellent
oatmeal
stout
a
really
excellent
beer
nothing
spectacular
here
but
not
a
bad
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
the
roast
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
when
i
taste
roasty
sweet
with
cocoa
nibs
and
espresso
beans
and
a
nicely
warming
body
smooth
and
delicious
if
anything
i
wish
you
could
taste
more
alcohol
a
bit
too
sweet
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
brown
i
tried
to
pour
for
head
and
only
got
about
a
14
inch
of
slightly
off
white
head
smell
is
faintly
of
iced
expresso
nice
coating
roasted
flavor
easy
drinking
a
quality
outmeal
stout
i
will
be
enjoying
more
of
this
in
the
future
very
tasty
beer
especially
if
you
like
lots
of
roastiness
one
of
the
stronger
roast
presence
in
this
style
ive
had
this
is
a
great
beer
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
now
im
kind
of
perplexed
by
the
sweet
smell
and
roasted
body
makeup
at
first
whiff
i
was
certain
it
was
going
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
not
so
fast
mister
this
ones
a
winner
overall
one
of
those
beers
thats
tastes
good
is
priced
well
and
is
reasonably
accessible
both
body
and
carbonation
hit
about
medium
goes
down
easy
dr
very
drinkable
i
quite
fancy
it
id
love
to
try
this
on
draught
quite
a
nice
flavorful
brew
give
her
a
spin
lads
pours
very
dark
with
minimal
head
nice
sticky
lacing
smells
very
strongly
of
coffee
with
some
chocolate
taste
follows
the
nose
along
with
some
added
oaty
character
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
somewhat
viscous
overall
this
is
excellent
better
than
others
of
the
style
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
comes
to
mind
highly
recommended
15
of
the
grist
is
oats
sucking
crawdad
heads
gives
you
the
real
mud
bug
experience
drinking
velvet
merlin
is
the
real
oatmeal
stout
experience
the
oats
are
palpable
in
this
velvet
beer
and
theyre
not
polite
they
are
oily
thick
slightly
astringent
and
grainy
and
omnipresent
here
bring
it
on
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
make
me
say
hell
yah
from
recipe
to
regal
pour
o
well
its
official
this
is
now
an
always
iso
hell
if
anyone
reads
this
and
wants
to
send
a
6
pack
my
way
please
let
me
know
and
ill
provide
goodies
from
my
neck
of
the
woods
as
it
warmed
it
did
get
a
touch
of
medicine
but
overall
this
beer
is
a
top
notch
oatmeal
stout
o
outstanding
a
wellbalanced
oatmeal
stout
that
just
comes
together
perfectly
you
can
taste
the
effort
that
went
into
making
this
my
new
goto
nonimperial
stout
black
like
a
tar
moat
with
some
nice
tan
one
finger
fluffies
sweet
cocoa
and
brown
sugar
dominate
the
nose
a
nice
light
roasty
aroma
smooth
slippery
slightly
sweet
and
very
roasty
chocolate
malts
and
and
caramel
work
their
way
to
the
front
creamy
light
body
is
easy
to
put
down
feelings
of
a
much
larger
body
is
due
to
the
heavy
small
bubble
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
has
some
flavor
flaws
which
are
rather
minor
and
its
mouthfeel
is
awesome
even
for
a
stout
like
this
good
stuff
superb
balance
a
perfect
cozy
beer
for
these
colder
months
nearly
black
in
color
when
you
pour
it
into
a
pint
glass
not
too
much
head
or
lacing
looks
very
appetizing
however
smell
of
oatmeal
chocolate
vague
raisin
bread
perhaps
and
a
wee
bit
of
molasses
great
smell
the
taste
is
slightly
underwhelming
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warms
the
complexity
begins
to
come
out
more
and
its
almost
like
the
perfect
combo
between
a
cream
stout
and
chocolate
stout
and
the
best
part
of
the
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
it
lives
up
to
the
name
feels
very
velvet
goes
down
smooth
and
full
leaving
you
satisfied
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
will
absolutely
come
back
to
again
each
year
around
winter
o
a
really
wellstyled
oatmeal
stout
that
i
wish
they
distributed
more
widely
it
is
one
of
fws
best
everyday
beers
pleasant
drinkable
average
stout
not
quite
the
velvet
one
might
hope
for
the
chocolate
bar
forward
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
roast
is
present
but
not
overpowering
a
flavorful
stout
well
constructed
we
all
have
our
preferences
in
beers
and
styles
i
have
a
definite
preference
for
the
bigger
stouts
the
bodies
are
fuller
the
flavors
more
intense
they
simple
appeal
to
me
much
more
than
their
smaller
counterparts
if
their
were
more
stouts
like
velvet
merlin
out
there
i
may
change
my
mind
flavors
are
bold
and
balanced
the
body
smooth
and
creamy
i
find
it
hard
to
admit
sometimes
that
another
state
makes
a
better
stout
than
what
is
available
in
michigan
at
least
a
kalamazoo
boy
is
responsible
for
this
one
absolutely
awesome
beer
fantastic
big
thanks
to
kevsal
for
the
bottle
poured
into
a
huge
duvel
tulip
glass
i
poured
aggressive
and
got
a
huge
4
inch
tanish
head
that
fell
quickly
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lacing
a
light
black
color
on
the
beer
itself
smell
is
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
coffee
hints
of
toffee
and
some
piney
hops
taste
is
lots
of
expresso
really
dominates
but
it
isnt
a
bad
thing
body
is
fairly
thin
but
that
is
expected
for
the
modest
abv
kind
of
dry
with
a
good
amount
of
life
a
nice
beer
i
would
drink
this
a
good
amount
if
it
was
available
overall
a
great
oatmeal
stout
thats
a
pleasure
to
look
forward
to
around
the
holidays
every
year
d
at
5
5
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
with
the
robust
flavors
i
could
drink
a
few
without
getting
bored
one
of
the
better
examples
of
an
oatmeal
stout
that
ive
had
i
enjoy
everything
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
deep
ruby
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
strong
roasted
aroma
with
a
bevy
of
graininess
rich
roasted
flavorvery
coffee
like
with
a
nice
touch
of
dark
chocolate
lingering
dryness
from
the
heavy
roasted
flavors
ok
mouthfeel
wisecould
use
a
kick
in
the
pants
stout
wise
lacks
some
of
the
velvety
creaminess
of
an
oatmeal
stout
a
nice
stout
for
the
most
part
personally
i
was
looking
for
more
umph
but
still
a
nice
example
overall
this
is
a
good
seasonal
stout
worth
enjoy
during
the
winter
time
nothing
to
special
but
easy
to
drink
o
very
drinkable
and
great
flavors
despite
lacking
some
smooth
oat
character
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
decent
stout
overall
not
the
most
complex
example
of
the
style
but
pleasant
enough
o
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
very
representative
of
the
style
i
love
the
use
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
the
flavors
really
stand
out
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
smallish
brown
head
head
disappears
quickly
with
minmal
lacing
nose
is
roasty
with
some
subtle
coffee
notes
taste
is
equally
roasty
with
some
chocolate
bitterness
and
tofee
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
prefer
nice
and
velvety
smooth
sorry
couldnt
resist
a
simple
but
delicious
beer
m
as
youd
expect
from
a
cask
its
extremely
smooth
a
sweet
chocolate
aftertaste
that
lingers
you
can
taste
and
feel
the
difference
between
cask
and
draft
two
very
different
beers
in
a
good
way
velvet
merlin
is
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
in
production
plain
and
simple
this
is
seriously
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
simple
no
frills
stouts
that
ive
ever
had
truely
impressed
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
ill
continue
to
seek
it
out
while
its
in
season
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
for
a
yearround
stout
that
isnt
barrelaged
tasty
and
complex
enough
with
a
good
balance
and
nice
finish
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
o
fairly
straightforward
very
well
balanced
a
great
oatmeal
stout
o
what
a
great
brew
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
highly
recommended
a
very
nice
sessionable
stout
a
nice
goto
to
have
during
the
winter
months
true
to
its
name
this
one
if
velvet
and
smooth
pours
dark
smells
boozy
and
roasty
mellow
looking
with
a
one
inch
white
head
which
only
resides
a
little
as
it
warms
taste
is
bold
but
mellow
at
the
same
time
burnt
and
bittersweet
in
the
finish
octoberlike
in
the
body
just
right
like
this
one
a
lot
better
than

curious
to
try
more
beers
from
this
crew
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
it
hasnt
broken
any
new
ground
though
for
the
style
this
oatmeal
stout
is
decent
but
im
more
partial
to
mendocino
brewing
co
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
price
you
can
pick
this
one
up

a

drinkable
i
only
wish
it
was
available
year
round
o
great
beer
this
has
been
a
top
want
for
quite
some
time
and
it
didnt
disappoint
just
a
great
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
minimal
khaki
head
classic
stout
aroma
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
coffee
aromas
taste
is
very
nicely
balanced
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
just
enough
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
there
is
a
little
bit
of
the
oatmeal
body
but
i
wanted
to
be
just
a
bit
heavier
overall
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
well
balanced
stout
the
softness
of
this
beer
really
stands
out
its
rich
and
drinkable
without
getting
you
plastered
smooth
and
coating
with
a
semidry
finish
darn
good
i
can
see
why
firestone
walkers
reputation
is
good
and
improving
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
simple
tasty
but
not
something
i
had
to
change
my
pants
over
i
bought
a
6
pack
but
i
wish
i
would
have
only
had
to
buy
four
especially
with
an
oatmeal
stout
i
was
looking
for
a
bigger
mouthfeel
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
ill
probably
not
get
it
again

ultra
smooth

stuff
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
the
fertile
mind
of
matt
bryndelsen
certainly
one
of
americas
best
oatmeal
stouts
really
drinkable
at
this
abv
recommended
certainly
something
id
happily
drink
again
and
something
with
plenty
of
dry
roasty
character
that
is
eminently
sessionable
no
bad
at
all
odid
they
change
this
from
last
year
i
remembered
it
being
a
lot
more
bold
and
rich
this
is
alright
but
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
something
is
different
with
the
current
batch
verdict
nicely
done
oatmeal
stout
very
palatable
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
admit
that
its
not
very
exciting
for
a
limited
release
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
a
really
nice
version
of
this
classic
style
o
i
think
ill
have
to
stock
up
on
this
for
the
upcoming
colder
months
of
winter
seems
like
this
would
be
a
nice
choice
sitting
next
to
the
fireplace
especially
if
you
want

on

this

is
right
around

it

a

love

beers
i
go
nuts
over
them
but
velvet
merkin
didnt
live
up
to
the
reputation
for
me
i
drank
this
after
drinking
another
local
stout
and
it
just
showed
how
light
on
all
fronts
this
beer
was
not
a
lot
in
the
nose
not
a
lot
in
flavor
i
wish
it
had
more
bite
to
its
flavor
and
mouth
feel
if
you
want
real
real
smooth
then
you
would
like
this
more
than
i
did
overall
great
beer
worth
the

almost
like
having
a

with
a
great

the
expert

of
all
the

roasted

definately
a
treat
smooth
like
velvet
fw
nails
this
as
they
always
do
overall
this
was
a
nice
but
lacking
in
that
big
it
factor
the
thin
body
was
much
too
noticeable
on
each
sip
still
it
is
firestone
and
therefore
is
always
worthy
of
a
try
this
will
be
in
my
treat
category
was
much
thinner
than
had
hoped
for
but
good
flavor
draft
dark
brown
coffee
bourbon
and
oak
were
the
dominant
smells
and
flavors
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
i
can
see
why
people
would
be
attracted
to
this
stout
but
its
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
with
the
perfect
amount
of
boozy
taste
from
the
bourbon
barrels
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
truly
it
is
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
however
the
2014
version
is
a
little
thinner
and
less
flavorful
than
i
was
expecting
reminds
me
of
the
difference
between
bourbon
neat
and
bourbon
on
the
rocks
the
flavor
is
there
but
its
a
little
muted
dont
get
me
wrong
though
few
ba
beers
live
up
to
the
quality
of
firestone
walkers
ba
program
would
recommend
to
anyone
overall
hey
its
freakin
velvet
merkin
its
delicious
fuhgedaboutit
the
body
is
a
bit
of
a
weak
spot
but
still
a
delicious
fw
beer
what
i
love
about
this
beer
is
that
it
has
big
flavors
with
out
being
overly
sweet
and
overly
boozy
it
has
the
complexity
of
bourbon
which
is
awesome
what
would
make
this
beer
better
is
if
had
a
1015
price
range
not
the
19
99
i
paid
most
other
reviews
are
spot
on
so
im
going
to
be
lazy
and
make
mine
simple
very
well
balanced
both
on
smell
and
taste
easy
to
drink
at
8
5
abv
its
something
you
can
drink
one
evening
after
work
which
i
did
the
complaints
about
it
being
a
little
light
on
the
mouthfeel
are
valid
but
if
you
know
that
going
n
youll
be
ok
its
not
a
thick
beer
but
that
adds
to
the
easy
drinkability
and
maybe
its
just
me
tonight
but
it
pairs
great
with
tillamook
sharp
cheddar
good
ahead
and
get
it
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
but
came
away
underwhelmed
i
felt
the
flavors
were
too
subtle
particularly
since
it
is
barrelaged
also
it
was
entirely
too
thin
for
my
taste
thin
mouthfeel
boozyhot
flavor
oaky
smell
a
big
disappointment
from
fw
was
hoping
it
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
parabola
but
not
even
close
i
guess
its
because
its
an
oatmeal
stout
rather
than
a
ris
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
very
delicious
a
bit
sweet
for
me
though
love
all
the
carbonation
o
delicious
effortless
grace
and
balance
the
barrel
character
is
front
and
center
but
never
overbearing
everything
melds
together
nicely
is
it
possible
for
a
liquid
to
melt
in
your
mouth
because
thats
what
it
feels
like
firestone
walkers
barrel
aged
beers
are
incomparable
so
good
phenomenal
aroma
delicious
taste
schwing
overall
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
velvet
merlin
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
and
velvet
merkin
is
now
an
alltime
favorite
of
the
bba
variety
firestone
as
usual
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
overall
i
tried
this
in
a
tasting
with
bcbs
and
fremont
kds
and
it
was
very
mild
and
lacking
in
flavor
against
those
offerings
but
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
i
love
the
creamy
texture
of
this
beer
and
im
a
big
bourbon
fan
so
i
picked
up
on
that
goodness
right
away
my
first
oatmeal
bourbon
barrel
outstanding
rating
of
the
2013
vintage
this
is
a
fine
barrel
aged
stout
there
is
a
little
smoke
and
cocoa
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
the
accent
of
the
bourbon
coming
through
fairly
pertinently
a
little
dark
fruit
comes
in
on
the
back
end
a
fine
sipping
beer
wonderful
beer
very
smooth
and
the
bourbon
aroma
works
well
was
drunk
as
a
celebration
beer
and
the
experience
was
well
worth
the
wait
amazing
overall
a
must
have
beer
in
the
colder
weather
d
the
great
nose
has
left
me
yearning
for
a
bit
more
yes
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
the
8
5
is
imperceivable
by
any
sense
however
the
lack
of
flavor
complexity
and
body
leaves
me
wanting
more
creamy
smooth
definitely
this
beer
is
what
it
is
but
based
on
the
15
price
tag
i
will
only
make
the
mistake
once
never
again
solid
but
unspectacular
there
just
isnt
enough
improvement
over
the
base
oatmeal
stout
to
warrant
the
cost
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
overall
very
good
2014
vintage
disappointed
expected
more
flavor
body
was
very
thin
would
not
spend
the
for
this
again
reaches
its
peak
6
months
after
release
date
fresh
too
tight
rough
at
1
year
the
oak
has
faded
some
other
people
have
already
touched
on
this
but
this
is
a
very
thin
watery
stout
if
you
really
like
bourbon
you
will
probably
enjoy
it
but
it
squashes
almost
all
flavors
very
disappointing
compared
to
the
other
firestone
offerings
not
undrinkable
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
unless
it
was
fresh
i
had
a
2013
version
maybe
it
does
not
hold
up
well
excellent
brew
with
good
complexity
bourbon
predominates
elegantly
and
it
is
far
from
cloying
remember
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
dont
compare
this
to
any
hoppy
imperial
yeah
the
complaints
about
the
mouthfeel
are
pretty
accurate
much
thinner
than
one
would
expect
flavors
are
fine
but
not
exceptional
the
weakest
of
fws
special
releases
which
is
almost
an
unfair
comparison
since
the
others
are
all
worldbeaters
or
close
to
it
silky
smooth
oatmeal
stout
goodness
o
bose
throw
me
off
but
the
taste
is
great
didnt
feel
it
would
be
great
to
age
but
i
really
enjoy
how
it
tastes
fresh
cant
wait
to
get
more
next
year
bourbon
is
a
nice
added
flavor
but
not
a
big
flavor
in
this
beer
bottom
line
not
buying
this
again
2013
vintage
poured
into
a
snifter
jet
black
appearance
with
a
thin
khaki
head
the
aroma
was
bourbon
with
sweet
notes
the
taste
was
very
elaborate
with
bourbon
vanilla
chocolate
oak
and
even
toffee
this
was
a
thinner
ba
stout
but
i
believe
that
was
the
intention
since
its
a
lower
abv
oatmeal
stout
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
of
these
recommendation
not
a
musttry
if
you
dont
care
for
velvet
merlin
but
definitely
still
worth
seeking
out
just
for
the
fact
that
fw
is
so
good
at
barrelaging
beers
draft
pours
dark
with
a
slight
red
hue
smell
is
coffee
and
caramel
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
you
can
taste
the
bourbon
but
its
not
overwhelming
balanced
with
coffee
and
sweet
malts
a
great
drinkable
barrelaged
beer
it
seriously
fell
short
of
my
expectation
mouthfeel
just
was
thin
flavor
was
light
bodied
and
dissipated
quickly
i
was
hoping
the
beer
would
feature
a
bit
bigger
mouthfeel
thats
the
one
drawback
for
me
cant
justify
the
price
of
this
when
i
can
get
six
packs
of
merlin
for
under
10
and
do
my
own
experimenting
with
vanilla
beans
and
whiskey
pour
is
black
with
a
light
brown
head
nose
is
bourbon
light
wood
assertive
malt
of
brownie
and
bakers
chocolate
taste
falls
a
little
short
on
the
richness
it
tastes
as
it
smells
but
a
bit
watered
down
it
has
the
bourbon
and
wood
up
front
some
fudge
notes
with
some
sweet
malt
berry
sweetness
body
is
a
touch
light
and
thins
in
the
back
the
finish
had
some
roasty
barrel
notes
but
a
hint
empty
a
bit
too
thin
but
the
taste
is
great
this
beer
has
everything
i
look
for
in
a
stout
every
aspect
lacks
nothing
first
sip
is
not
quite
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
have
suggested
but
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
vanilla
and
fruit
notes
and
more
bitter
roasted
flavors
bourbon
flavors
add
a
little
heat
and
a
nice
bit
of
woodiness
to
it
all
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
helps
carry
all
this
flavor
overall
firestone
has
one
the
best
barrel
games
in
the
business
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
wonderful
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
great
seasonal
beer
poured
into
tulip
glass
black
with
dark
head
which
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
of
vanilla
carmel
coffee
and
bourbon
taste
is
smooth
almost
too
smooth
im
looking
for
some
finish
to
it
but
its
not
there
it
kind
of
dies
in
my
mouth
lite
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
is
lite
for
an
oatmeal
stout
taste
is
mild
bourbon
is
there
but
the
bourbon
aging
seems
to
have
eclipsed
the
other
flavors
over
all
i
think
i
like
the
velvet
merlin
better
overall
a
very
good
barrel
aged
stout
and
would
likely
stand
up
well
to
aging
i
believe
this
beer
suffered
in
comparison
to
the
rest
of
the
stouts
we
were
drinking
last
night
tasted
a
bit
thin
and
harsh
after
the
likes
of
assassin
three
bcbs
variants
etc
im
sure
if
im
able
to
retry
it
at
a
later
time
the
score
may
improve
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
this
brew
its
an
oatmeal
stout
not
a
russian
imperial
or
american
double
those
that
say
it
feels
a
bit
thin
should
rethink
what
it
is
they
are
drinking
ive
had
their
regular
oatmeal
stout
and
it
is
one
of
the
creamiest
mouthfeels
i
can
remember
this
one
follows
suit
with
the
bourbon
barrel
love
oak
vanilla
booze
chocolate
a
bit
of
a
coffee
taste
and
all
around
luxury
i
rate
my
beers
based
off
of
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
and
how
much
i
enjoy
it
this
may
be
the
only
bourbon
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
and
its
great
so
4
5
it
is
dont
stack
this
one
up
beside
parabola
and
judge
it
drink
it
for
what
it
is
what
it
was
meant
to
be
and
enjoy
the
velvet
in
the
name
should
also
be
the
description
if
you
are
one
to
enjoy
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
get
some
of
this
cant
compare
it
to
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
as
this
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
bourbon
country
brrrrr
and
other
highly
scored
beers
are
all
part
of
the
pilgrimage
towards
getting
your
hands
on
this
awesome
beer
pours
dark
with
a
nice
head
smells
like
liquor
tastes
like
it
minus
the
bite
of
alcohol
super
solid
beer
dont
miss
it
worth
the
price
9
9oz
was
worth
it
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
i
can
easily
get
over
how
thin
this
stout
is
because
of
the
excellent
flavors
from
the
oatmeal
and
bourbon
barrel
o
4
really
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
and
good
but
not
worth
the
15
99
and
hassle
to
hunt
it
down
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
buy
it
again
in
the
future
this
is
probably
my
favorite
ba
stout
give
it
a
year
though
it
ages
great
overall
excellent
beer
here
not
a
true
oatmeal
stout
that
many
who
like
the
style
would
expect
but
an
interesting
melody
of
flavors
and
styles
what
really
came
through
were
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
you
would
expect
from
barrel
aged
beer
pricy
but
very
tasty
cheers
o
quite
a
good
beer
overall
the
body
is
a
bit
lacking
but
otherwise
is
great
theres
a
big
bitterness
and
a
mighty
roast
on
this
but
its
offset
by
a
creamy
albeit
surprisingly
thin
consistency
the
oatmeal
in
the
oatmeal
stout
plus
the
masterful
blending
that
fw
is
known
for
i
still
get
some
barrelaged
notes
vanilla
and
coconut
and
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
rum
but
i
find
myself
wishing
for
just
a
tad
more
more
body
more
booze
a
touch
more
heat
to
contrast
on
the
end
still
delicious
and
definitely
memorable
i
saved
this
for
a
reason
and
it
did
not
disappoint
amazing
smooth
caramel
tones
from
bourbon
barrels
delicious
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
half
finger
mocha
colored
head
the
smell
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
bourbon
and
the
oatmeal
malt
chocolate
vanilla
coffee
slight
booze
actually
quite
a
delicious
nose
the
flavor
is
predominantly
the
bourbon
and
the
wood
the
stout
it
self
gets
somewhat
buried
maybe
a
bigger
higher
abv
stout
would
hold
up
better
to
this
barrel
the
mouthfeel
is
also
slightly
thin
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
however
the
complex
nose
is
more
intriguing
than
the
flavor
overall
a
rather
tasty
oatmeal
stout
overall
with
a
nice
hit
of
woody
bourbon
flavor
without
a
whole
lot
of
heavy
and
hot
booziness
a
nice
oatmeal
semisweet
roasty
brew
o
im
not
buying
another
beer
from
this
company
again
no
offense
but
at
16
a
bottle
id
expect
this
to
have
a
bigger
profile
moreover
the
body
is
too
weak
for
the
bourbon
characteristics
at
times
this
taste
like
the
last
few
sips
of
a
jack
and
coke
with
a
breathe
of
coffee
to
come
back
up
this
is
so
weak
words
cannot
tell
you
how
disappointed
i
am
with
this
brew
im
debating
regurgitating
what
i
swallowed
putting
it
back
in
the
bottle
and
asking
for
a
refund
its
not
bad
its
just
absolutely
disappointing
overall
bestnameever
oh
so
seductive
actually
that
last
part
is
a
true
statement
about
the
aroma
it
floats
out
of
the
bottle
and
just
like
the
smell
lines
of
a
pie
will
lift
any
cartoon
character
right
off
their
feet
pulls
you
firmly
in
the
bourbon
is
delicate
but
expertly
represented
giving
all
of
the
essence
without
any
of
the
nasty
this
blends
with
the
oddity
of
the
malt
base
which
is
oat
setting
the
stage
for
a
markedly
complex
presentation
things
are
going
great
at
this
point
then
you
sip
it
would
be
a
crime
to
say
that
the
beer
takes
a
wrong
turn
here
but
it
just
isnt
quite
what
we
were
expecting
remember
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
this
is
not
your
typical
hulkedup
american
imperial
this
is
velvet
the
flavoring
comes
across
due
in
part
to
the
sweetness
of
grain
wood
and
chocolate
much
like
a
milksweet
stout
with
high
residual
sugars
once
you
accept
this
fact
you
will
have
a
much
better
time
and
youll
enjoy
the
beer
much
more
we
were
so
so
excited
when
we
found
this
beer
and
while
it
doesnt
disappoint
by
any
means
we
had
hoped
it
would
be
a
little
more
bold
that
is
in
our
failing
of
false
expectations
not
the
beers
or
the
brewers
as
the
final
product
presented
is
worthy
of
all
its
accolades
awesome
subtle
bourbon
flavor
brings
this
to
life
doesnt
overpower
at
all
a
very
good
beer
that
is
just
solid
in
its
structure
its
not
very
showy
in
its
flavors
but
does
throw
enough
out
there
to
not
be
too
boring
i
like
it
for
being
a
more
subdued
higheroctane
stout
im
glad
that
i
got
a
chance
to
drink
this
fresh
as
i
dont
think
it
will
hold
up
very
long
especially
at
8
5
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
and
the
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
i
think
if
it
had
more
barrel
presence
i
would
have
rated
it
higher
it
was
kind
of
muted
great
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
this
beer
looks
like
cold
black
coffee
when
held
up
to
the
light
i
can
see
thru
it
not
much
head
retention
not
exactly
an
elegant
looking
beer
sure
does
smell
good
tho
its
not
in
your
face
in
the
aroma
but
very
pleasing
mix
of
malts
and
bourbon
the
vanillalike
aroma
from
the
wood
smells
amazing
tastes
like
a
bit
of
chocolate
dipped
in
a
bit
of
watered
down
bourbon
the
low
abv
kinda
makes
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
for
a
bba
stout
but
really
helps
the
balance
of
the
taste
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
darn
good
balance
in
the
bourbon
and
stout
flavors
is
everything
here
beautiful
with
a
big
black
color
and
a
sturdy
tan
head
awesome
aroma
with
bourbon
vanilla
and
cane
sugar
smooth
flavors
follow
led
by
a
well
behaved
bourbon
aspect
maybe
a
little
thin
for
a
bigger
oatmeal
stout
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
you
without
a
doubt
get
the
bourbon
character
in
the
nose
and
in
the
front
after
awhile
the
bourbon
character
softens
and
you
get
more
of
the
oatmeal
i
get
a
slight
vanilla
but
little
to
known
of
the
chocolate
flavors
great
beer
o
its
a
good
beer
but
a
little
sweeter
and
lighter
than
i
expected
at
8
5
though
its
impressive
overall
had
this
on
tap
last
year
and
thought
it
was
fairly
disappointing
im
not
sure
if
this
batch
is
any
better
or
its
that
my
expectations
arent
as
high
but
im
not
quite
as
down
on
it
this
time
around
though
that
doesnt
mean
im
still
not
underwhelmed
the
aroma
is
amazing
but
unfortunately
the
flavor
and
body
dont
live
up
to
expectations
at
15
per
bottle
this
is
one
firestone
ba
brew
that
i
wont
be
buying
a
2nd
bottle
of
which
to
age
in
fact
im
not
even
sure
what
aging
could
possibly
do
for
this
beer
there
simply
isnt
enough
here
o
at
roughly
18
a
bottle
i
did
not
really
feel
this
was
a
big
enough
beer
to
justify
the
price
tag
its
a
nice
beer
for
sure
but
id
only
go
here
again
if
it
were
about
half
the
price
oatmeal

vanilla
subtle
bourbon
flavor
a

of

roast
body
is
medium
very
smooth

acidity
is

lingering
moderate

its

not
great
so
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
15
nor
advise
you
to
buy
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
instead
looks
lighter
in
body
and
color
than
most

stouts
initial
taste
is
basically

a

profile
going
on
a
hint
of
bourbon
but
very
mild
and
few
other
barrel
characteristics
the

amazing
vanillagraham

chocolatetoasted

the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
overall
i
remembered
this
as
being
better
from
last
year
looking
forward
to
updating
this
review
once
i
crack
my
cellared
13
o
great
sipping
brew
with
good
whiskey
and
wood
notes
its
pricey
and
i
think
i
like
the
nonbarrelaged
version
better
if
thats
possible
but
the
8
5
abv
is
cool
because
most
barrelaged
stouts
are
10
plus
and
this
is
much
less
i
like
that
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
the
firestone
walker
barrel
aged
series
and
i
was
fortunate
to
find
a
bottle
very
enjoyable
but
was
hoping
for
better
would
chose
parabola
over
this
one
overall
if
your
a
big
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
for
you
i
wanted
something
a
little
more
crazy
but
it
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
as
always
great
barrel
aging
brewing
perfected
overall
very
nice
beer
not
quite
the
depth
of
the
other
fw
barrel
aged
brews
kind
of
a
parabola
lite
and
that
aint
bad
o
lots
of
bourbon
coming
from
this
one
even
after
a
year
of
aging
perhaps
due
to
the
base
beer
being
a
bit
lower
in
alcohol
still
a
nice
chocolaty
bourbon
bomb
that
is
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
4
25
the
rarity
is
a
distraction
not
your
everyday
quaff
by
any
means
but
knowing
it
can
be
found
for
that
certain
occasion
would
enhance
the
whole
idea
of
knowing
its
out
there
i
took
my
73
year
old
uncle
eddy
to
a
doctors
appointment
in
providence
ri
it
was
a
routine
check
up
that
told
us
everything
was
fine
sweet
after
learning
this
i
axed
him
if
he
would
enjoy
a
pint
with
me
his
response
was
hell
yah
since
i
was
in
providence
i
took
him
to
julians
a
place
that
is
known
for
its
draft
selection
when
i
sat
at
the
bar
i
noticed
a
firestone
walker
tap
i
hadnt
seen
before
i
ordered
one
because
that
brewery
has
not
let
me
down
before
the
velvet
merkin
was
placed
in
front
of
me
its
blackness
alone
was
intoxicating
the
head
was
a
thick
brownish
tan
that
stayed
until
the
end
all
i
could
smell
was
whiskey
this
beer
was
everything
i
could
hope
for
in
a
bourbon
barrel
stout
the
vanilla
was
just
right
so
it
actually
tasted
like
beer
the
finish
was
to
good
to
be
true
i
could
have
drank
10
of
them
but
i
had
to
drive
my
uncle
home
needless
to
say
i
enjoyed
this
fine
brew
to
the
fullest
2013
vintage
pours
black
as
pitch
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
nose
with
prominent
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
lots
of
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
and
bourbon
on
the
tongue
smooth
velvety
mouth
feel
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
an
extremely
well
crafted
and
balanced
beer
in
my
opinion
firestone
walker
has
the
finest
barrel
aging
program
out
there
o
firestone
walker
never
seems
to
disappoint
and
this
is
no
exception
velvet
merkin
is
a
well
done
beer
that
everyone
should
make
sure
to
try
i
love
the
bourbon
effect
on
this
one
its
mild
almost
subtle
not
boozy
at
all
and
melds
well
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
highs
and
lows
overall
good
but
not
something
im
going
to
hardcore
crave
again
overall
world
class
beer
lovely
aroma
great
flavor
not
overwhelming
the
bourbon
dominates
on
the
front
end
but
some
great
flavors
smoothly
flow
in
the
beer
there
is
bitterness
that
i
did
not
expect
with
an
oatmeal
stout
but
overall
world
class
beer
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
a
few
more
to
cellar
this
is
the
2013
edition
that
i
tasted
in
june
2014
definitely
worth
a
try
when
available
im
a
huge
fan
of
velvet
merlin
so
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
the
appearance
and
aroma
hinted
at
greatness
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
felt
somewhat
watered
down
still
this
one
sets
the
bar
for
the
oatmeal
stout
category
overall
coming
from
someone
who
enjoyed
velvet
merlin
because
of
the
sessionability
word
and
great
flavor
i
cant
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
bb
stouts
ive
ever
had
but
its
delicious
the
bourbon
barrel
ads
subtle
nuances
that
you
appreciate
when
having
had
the
base
beer
first
and
this
is
dangerous
if
you
can
find
this
on
draft
somewhere
with
unlimited
pours
youll
be
in
for
quite
the
night
o
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
i
would
definitely
seek
out
again
barrel
aging
played
a
huge
role
in
this
beer
turning
a
tasty
yet
straightforward
oatmeal
stout
into
something
wonderfully
complex
six
months
of
age
really
softened
some
of
this
beers
rougher
edges
when
fresh
i
would
love
to
revisit
another
bottle
with
even
a
bit
more
age
on
it
the
beer
has
many
characteristics
of
a
boozy
winter
sipper
but
refrains
from
being
cloying
or
overly
hot
from
alcohol
i
enjoy
the
restrained
character
of
8
5
abv
compared
to
the
over
the
top
10
or
more
that
is
often
found
in
specialty
barrel
aged
beers
by
no
means
is
it
a
quick
drink
but
it
doesnt
leave
you
overwhelmed
o
a
lighter
companion
to
the
parabola
and
sucaba
in
the
reserve
series
nicely
balanced
and
about
as
expected
for
an
8
5
abv
i
would
recommend
it
with
those
caveats
mouthfeel
is
unique
to
many
barrel
aged
beers
and
in
my
opinion
the
best
part
of
this
beer
its
only
medium
bodied
yet
the
flavor
lingers
longer
on
the
palate
than
youd
expect
based
on
how
light
it
feels
there
is
a
light
airy
carbonation
and
it
really
does
have
a
light
feel
to
it
like
a
barrel
aged
stout
designed
for
a
hot
summer
day
barrel
provides
a
dry
bitter
finish
and
really
only
a
little
bit
of
heat
great
drinkability
and
not
too
filling
even
if
you
finish
the
bottle
on
your
own
not
my
favorite
but
firestone
walker
is
still
one
of
my
top
go
to
breweries
for
barrel
aged
beers
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
given
its
reputation
and
semirarity
it
should
have
been
better
its
thin
and
simplistic
two
things
i
dont
want
from
a
barrelaged
offering
honestly
i
think
id
like
the
regular
velvet
merlin
more
but
we
dont
get
that
in
maryland
seriously
wtf
maryland
gets
all
the
barrelaged
offerings
from
fw
but
not
pivo
pils
or
velvet
merlin
a
bit
different
than
what
im
used
to
in
oatmeal
stouts
everything
about
this
beer
is
in
moderation
and
that
makes
it
a
real
treat
o
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
take
it
for
whats
it
worth
an
oatmeal
stout
lacks
complexity
but
doesnt
need
it
o
4
5
the
smell
is
pretty
phenomenal
but
as
you
drink
it
it
thins
out
quite
a
lot
probably
because
its
an
8
barrel
aged
beer
given
the
choice
id
buy
a
ddba
or
parabola
instead
milk
chocolate
oats
cocoa
dark
chocolate
balanced
bourbon
oak
coffee
roast
overall
love
the
lighter
feel
bourbon
stout
while
maintaining
its
oaty
self
delivers
all
around
very
good
overall
a
really
nice
smooth
and
relatively
easydrinking
beer
this
is
positively
sessionable
as
far
as
barrelaged
beers
go
really
welldone
pretty
huge
fan
of
what
this
beer
brings
to
the
table
it
is
like
a
chocolate
oatmeal
cookie
with
a
dollop
of
vanilla
bourbon
frosting
on
top
at
times
the
oatmeal
side
of
things
is
impressive
and
it
isnt
just
a
roast
bomb
great
balance
is
the
key
to
this
brew
overall
its
still
a
very
good
brew
the
smell
alone
carries
it
quite
far
but
its
still
a
bit
of
a
letdown
all
the
same
a
little
bit
with
the
flavor
but
really
with
the
mouthfeel
there
was
a
thread
about
the
importance
of
mouthfeel
the
other
day
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
an
otherwise
outstanding
beer
can
take
a
serious
step
back
without
the
appropriate
body
and
carbonation
o
a
good
beer
that
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
firestone
walker
has
ridiculous
expectations
set
on
their
barrelaged
beers
and
rightfully
so
as
most
of
them
are
near
perfect
this
one
for
me
was
missing
body
and
lower
on
aromasflavors
of
bourbon
than
i
wanted
still
an
excellent
ba
oatmeal
stout
that
is
lower
in
abv
o
im
quite
impressed
velvet
merlin
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
but
the
other
reviews
had
me
worried
about
this
one
while
not
the
most
amazing
barrelaged
stout
this
is
an
excellent
brew
overall
wow
every
barrel
aged
beer
firestone
walker
has
done
has
been
lights
out
amazing
and
worth
every
penny
this
one
is
no
different
i
love
the
depth
of
the
barrel
aging
and
yet
this
still
has
a
lot
of
stout
to
it
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
overall
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
the
beer
is
barely
fitting
of
the
firestone
walker
name
it
lacks
body
most
importantly
and
a
bit
of
flavor
the
smooth
barrel
notes
exist
but
the
complete
picture
is
just
not
there
had
from
a
22oz
bottle
in
a
snifter
it
pours
a
darkish
brown
black
color
it
has
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasts
for
awhile
it
has
a
strong
nose
of
oak
bourbon
sweetness
on
the
taste
i
got
some
oak
the
sweetness
of
a
bourbon
some
oats
vanilla
and
some
caramel
it
has
a
mediumfull
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
dry
but
sweet
finish
overall
this
is
one
of
the
nicest
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
have
had
firestone
definitely
does
an
amazing
job
overall
this
is
yet
another
bourbon
barrel
beer
in
what
seems
to
be
an
endless
selection
of
these
days
but
firestone
as
to
be
expected
deliver
the
goods
with
a
nearly
spectacular
beer
12oz
tulip
glass

md
i
had
this
months
ago
when
it
first
came
out
and
i
hate
to
age
beers
but
this
is
a
case
where
some
age
has
really
done
the
beer
some
good
i
feel
the
additional
time
helped
integrate
the
flavor
more
im
picking
up
much
more
coconut
and
vanilla
in
this
bee
not
much
if
any
of
the
bourbon
barrel
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
though
the
bourbon
to
give
some
extra
sweetness
vanilla
and
coconut
dont
drink
this
expecting
big
barrel
character
instead
expect
a
well
integrated
beer
overall
was
in
the
mood
for
a
delicious
ba
stout
and
this
one
did
just
fine
not
as
heavy
since
its
an
oatmeal
stout
but
a
ton
of
complexity
im
a
big
bourbon
fan
so
i
loved
the
barrel
character
and
how
potent
it
was
firestone
walker
doesnt
mess
around
with
this
series
a
nicely
done
oatmeal
stout
barrel
aging
is
unique
with
an
oatmeal
stout
usually
its
reserved
for
the
heavier
styles
like
russian
imperials
or
double
stouts
but
it
worked
here
2013
bottle
from

thanks
so
much
pours
dark
brown
to
black
in
my
fw
barrelworks
teku
with
a

chocolate
vanilla
whiskey
graham

toasted

flavor
is
chocolate
up

with
some
big
time
vanilla
tones
on
top
of
graham
crackers
followed
by
a
punch
of
strong
whiskey
and
long
lasting
oaky
vanilla
the
lasting
finish
is
the
real
highlight
of
this
beer
palate
is
velvety
smooth
up
front
and
while
not
a
super
thick
beer
i
see
no
reason
to
complain
about
thin
body
here
plenty
of
body
especially
for
the
abv
and
medium
carbonation
this
was
a
winner
for
me
with
just
the
right
amount
of
barrel
character
rather
than
the
in
your
face
whiskey
shot
i
get
with
lower
abv
stouts
and
porters
aged
in
barrels
as
usual
firestone

kicks

a
very
dark
brown
with
a
14
inch

some

aroma
of
vanilla

chocolate
and
some
coffee
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
with
some
vanilla
as
well
some
bitter
dark
chocolate
towards
the
end
boozey
vanilla
and
caramel
at
the
finish
slick
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
one
of
the
boozier
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
overall
id
get
it
again
overall
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
firestone
walker
is
a
brewery
of
masters
others
may
make
showier
and
excellent
beers
but
firestone
perfects
a
recipe
and
then
shares
their
brilliant
work
with
its
fans
wonderful
beer
2013
vintage
poured
into
oversized
wine
glass
nice
head
on
this
one
more
black
than
brown
not
much
of
an
aroma
whats
there
is
almost
off
putting
creamy
taste
but
very
little
coffee
and
bourbon
presence
i
do
get
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
body
is
lighter
than
i
expected
and
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
overall
i
expected
more
from
this
one
but
still
a
tasty
offering
when
a
fw
brew
comes
in
a
box
you
expect
great
things
aroma
of
toasted
oats
touch
of
chocolate
some
malt
very
light
bodied
thin
flavor
profile
oats
cocoa
some
hops
for
fw
this
is
terribly
disappointing
and
downright
boring
o
not
often
you
find
a
barrel
aged
oatmeal
stout
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
bourbon
in
this
one
but
it
still
works
pretty
nicely
oatmeal
as
always
provides
a
nice
layer
of
creaminess
and
smooths
the
whole
thing
out
well
balanced
not
overly
complex
or
hot
for
that
matter
either
very
nice
taste
shows
some
bold
barrel
character
to
go
along
with
a
lactosey
sweet
milk
stout
its
smooth
and
creamy
but
i
could
actually
use
a
little
more
chocolate
and
malt
depth
its
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
the
barrel
seems
to
overpower
the
malt
character
of
the
beer
incredible
beer
im
glad
i
have
another
to
cellar
o
outstanding
reminds
me
of
bcbs
but
in
a
lighter
form
the
abv
is
perfect
i
love
the
feel
impressed
with
all
the
flavor
that
got
packed
into
it
if
this
was
a
readily
available
beer
id
be
broke
so
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
almost
a
standard
bearer
for
me
another
barrel
aged
beast
from
fw
bravo
final
thoughts
price
is
very
high
at
14
20
a
bottle
and
the
abv
is
nice
but
i
like
a
little
more
at
8
5
still
worth
a
try
or
a
million
cheers
an
outstanding
oatmeal
stout
the
bourbon
is
in
near
perfect
balance
with
the
creamy
base
this
is
worth
seeking
out
to
give
a
try
oneed
to
try
this
one
again
it
was
a
good
beer
but
compared
to
the
utopias
that
night
it
couldnt
compare
poured
into
a
reubens
brew
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
light
slippery
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
sweet
dark
toasted
malt
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavor
is
vanilla
mild
toasted
malt
cocoa
lactose
a
touch
of
coffee
coconut
and
bourbon
light
to
medium
bodied
a
nice
stout
with
complex
flavor
and
a
deft
touch
of
bourbon
from
the
barrel
surprisingly
thin
bodied
for
an
oatmeal
stout
perhaps
the
lightest
ive
ever
had
i
would
never
have
identified
this
as
having
oatmeal
in
it
in
a
blind
taste
still
tasty
different
cant
help
but
think
that
this
would
have
been
outstanding
with
a
bit
heavier
malt
body
overall
this
brew
rocks
with
the
flavor
and
nose
one
expects
a
viscous
brew
but
other
than
that
this
is
worthy
of
trying
if
you
can
scarce
up
a
bottle
o
what
i
like
best
about
this
is
that
the
bourbon
is
not
overwhelming
all
the
nice
oatmeal
stout
flavors
are
allowed
to
shine
and
the
bourbon
is
there
to
cut
some
of
the
sweetness
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
share
amongst
friends
fantastic
beer
super
smooth
and
understated
very
drinkable
and
low
abv
for
the
style
o
one
of
the
best
firestone
products
to
date
and
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
super
smooth
and
integrated
fresh
out
of
the
bottle
definitely
need
to
go
grab
a
few
more
of
these
really
well
done
o
one
of
the
more
oatmeal
forward
stouts
in
recent
memory
very
well
balanced
with
a
dessert
quality
to
it
the
barrel
really
showcases
how
well
the
oatmeal
works
with
it
fantastic
now
i
would
be
surprised
if
this
improved
any
with
age
i
say
drink
now
so
glad
this
is
now
in
the
reserve
series
very
deserving
o
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
hype
behind
this
one
i
probably
will
seek
out
one
bottle
next
year
and
not
go
overboard
searching
for
it
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
say
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
has
been
receiving
there
just
wasnt
anything
that
really
stood
out
for
me
maybe
i
just
had
too
high
of
expectations
loving
parabola
and
sucaba
definitely
worth
the
try
but
there
is
no
way
id
pay
17
for
another
bottle
even
at
half
that
id
be
a
little
bit
hesitant
dark

pour
slightly
translucent

chocolate
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
surprising
for
an
oatmeal
stout
body
was
about
medium
boozy
presence
was
felt
but
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
not
hot
at
all
a
decent
brew
overall
overall
another
barrelaged
wonder
from
firestone
walker
m
perfectly
smooth
minimal
carbonation
thick
very
warming
combines
with
a
great
balanced
but
bkurbony
flavor
profile
to
form
an
incredibly
nice
drinking
brew
o
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
a
bit
chilled
but
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
honestly
tho
this
is
prob
my
least
favorite
fw
ba
beer
but
still
quite
delicious
and
a
nice
alternative
to
parabola
highly
drinkable
very
relaxed
smooth
easy
barrelaged
brew
not
a
typical
over
the
top
ba
brew
highly
recommended
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
can
find
it
heres
to
700
more
cheers
definitely
a
nice
beer
here
it
has
a
nice
smell
with
a
taste
to
match
for
being
a
big
beer
it
goes
down
easy
id
easily
drink
more
of
this
overall
this
beer
is
awesome
firestone
walker
really
might
have
the
best
barrel
aging
program
out
there
between
this
and
the
3
other
offerings
that
fw
has
im
having
a
hard
time
figuring
out
which
is
my
favorite
this
beer
will
be
on
my
purchase
list
every
year
and
im
already
anticipating
when
i
can
buy
it
again
even
though
i
still
have
half
the
bottle
left
a
very
noticeable
oakbourbon
scent
right
off
the
top
strongly
suggests
what
the
rest
of
the
tasting
experience
may
be
like
silky
sweet
taste
and
feel
mostly
comprised
of
a
deeply
rich
yet
zesty
chocolate
tone
mint
chocolate
quality
overall
adding
a
very
tasty
and
appealing
sweetness
and
zing
to
things
an
exquisitely
wellbalanced
and
complex
dark
ale
deep
and
engrossing
and
nearperfect
overall
the
best
part
about
this
brew
is
the
drinkability
you
can
throw
down
a
bomber
of
this
without
struggling
it
is
delicious
and
enjoyed
but
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
my
bba
stouts
to
be
thicker
and
with
more
intense
aromas
and
flavors
still
this
works
really
well
wow
ive
read
all
of
the
reviews
on
here
about
poor
mouth
feel
of
this
beer
i
truly
disagree
with
all
of
those
reviews
this
beer
is
fantastic
im
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
unique
flavor
profile
great
chocolate
malt
dark
fruit
etc
true
its
no
bourbon
county
in
terms
of
mouth
feel
but
truly
a
great
drive
king
experience
in
terms
of
flavor
fbgm
on
the
whole
velvet
merkin
is
perhaps
the
finest
beer
i
have
had
by
firestone
walker
thus
far
and
a
truly
superior
stout
by
any
standard
its
a
damn
shame
this
one
doesnt
come
around
more
often
and
i
wish
id
bought
more
than
one
bottle
odfirestone
walker
barrel
aged
brews
are
an
automatic
this
one
may
be
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
not
as
huge
as
the
others
but
its
complexity
is
unmatched
this
beer
tastes
like
it
was
made
just
for
me
and
my
taste
buds
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
instant
classic
it
smells
of
sweet
bourbon
like
scotch
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
like
oatmeal
with
chocolate
milk
finish
is
ozone
and
chalky
sweet
its
okay
but
it
really
suffers
from
the
mouthfeel
its
thin
and
flat
smooooth
but
it
kills
the
flavor
ill
try
it
again
sometime
but
this
was
not
that
impressive
o
another
winner
from
firestone
for
sure
this
one
is
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
to
boot
im
sure
this
one
is
only
gonna
get
better
with
age
just
a
slight
amount
of
heat
but
thatll
probably
fall
off
with
age
glad
i
got
some
for
my
cellar
bottled
82313
medium
to
full
body
creamy
with
smooth
decent
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
for
this
high
abv
as
the
bourbon
barrel
flavors
are
well
integrated
drinking
nicely
so
soon
after
release
overall
love
this
one
fw
is
amazing
overall
not
my
favorite
offering
from
fw
but
still
a
well
executed
beer
an
easy
drinking
and
balanced
beer
o
killer
stout
here
wish
i
could
have
given
a
more
detailed
review
of
this
one
its
not
quite
to
the
level
of
parabola
the
bourbon
barrel
isnt
quite
as
pronounced
as
id
like
it
to
be
still
a
damn
fine
stout
fw
you
are
the
masters
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
ive
come
to
expect
the
world
from
firestone
barrelaged
beers
this
one
didnt
turn
my
crank
quite
so
hard
a
good
beer
but
not
as
deadcenter
as
pretty
much
everything
else
they
do
o
excellent
stuff
like
the
flavor
in
this
relatively
low
abv
barrel
aged
stout
this
bba
oatmeal
stout
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
more
hints
of
vanilla
bourbon
and
roasted
malt
flow
throughout
the
nose
and
taste
an
exquisite
pleasure
to
drink
not
overly
boozy
at
all
creamy
and
smooth
love
the
mouthfeel
on
this
wish
i
had
a
case
firestone
walker
are
the
masters
of
stouts
and
barrels
i
highly
recommend
searching
this
out
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
2
on
trade
from
the
bottle
release
it
develops
even
more
as
it
warms
up
cheers
to
an
almost
perfect
oatmeal
stout
o
an
amazingly
complex
stout
that
lives
up
to
all
the
hype
well
worth
the
15
if
you
can
find
it
3000
cases
produced
recommended
just
fantastic
thanks
to
claystation
for
bringing
this
over
long
anticipated
for
me
this
pours
a
honey
thick
mocha
brown
color
smooth
as
silk
in
the
snifter
and
showing
off
over
an
inch
of
oatmeal
foam
it
smells
so
much
less
alcoholic
than
i
expected
mostly
because
of
how
alcohol
forward
most
of
the
other
boxed
offerings
have
been
this
one
is
sweet
and
rich
subtle
spice
and
vanilla
from
the
barrel
a
lot
of
oatmeal
body
and
sweetness
and
an
aggressively
bitter
cocoa
barley
vibe
its
all
blends
together
exquisitely
well
and
some
of
the
heavier
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
tobacco
raisins
and
butter
cream
come
out
in
the
last
legs
alcohol
never
makes
an
appearance
not
even
at
room
temperature
and
the
bourbon
contributes
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
and
smoothness
these
days
so
many
barreled
beers
dont
taste
a
lot
like
beer
anymore
this
one
is
perfect
speaking
of
perfect
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
could
not
be
improved
its
full
bodied
as
they
come
not
sharp
at
all
from
booze
palate
coating
but
not
sticky
thick
but
fluent
everything
one
could
ask
for
in
a
stout
like
this
its
sensational
worth
the
wait
worth
the
money
share
it
with
a
loved
one
or
three
amazing
stuff
from
the
top
shelf
firestone
stuff
never
a
surprise
luscious
and
dark
dangerously
easy
down
balanced
brilliantly
this
is
a
must
firestone
walker
is
not
capable
of
making
a
bad
beer
and
in
fact
they
only
make
good
beers
if
its
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
to
style
they
will
follow
it
to
the
t
if
it
is
a
hybrid
they
are
willing
to
go
nuts
with
it
velvet
merkin
has
a
good
story
behind
it
and
is
made
with
so
much
love
and
care
you
can
taste
it
i
am
overwhelmed
by
the
thick
dark
toasted
presence
of
this
beer
some
toasted
coconut
is
present
with
also
a
nice
roasted
tobacco
some
alcohol
warmth
but
nothing
as
compared
to
their
other
specialty
beers
this
is
the
zenith
that
all
beer
should
try
to
achieve
if
have
not
had
this
yet
try
and
find
a
bottle
to
drink
now
and
bottle
to
cellar
feelin
it
but
not
feeelin
it
o
nice
and
solid
nice
flavors
i
was
wishing
for
a
bit
more
depth
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
wow
this
beer
beat
the
deschutes
sucaba
parobola
and
anniversary
beers
that
i
have
had
2012
and
2013
smooth
and
potent
the
bourbon
aging
is
so
smooth
that
it
sneaks
up
on
you
the
appearance
is
without
reproach
creamy
head
and
dark
body
if
you
can
find
it
buy
all
that
you
can
i
got
3
bottles
and
am
debating
between
aging
the
remaining
two
or
drinking
them
now
because
the
first
was
so
good
i
lucked
out
and
found
it
at
my
local
whole
foods
after
visiting
numerous
bevmos
and
other
local
beer
stores
in
my
area
enjoy
enjoy
enjoy
cheers
o
a
superb
light
ba
beer
whose
excellence
is
typical
of
fws
barrel
program
lots
of
flavor
in
a
lighter
package
than
its
cousin
parabola
akin
more
to
cw
bbs
than
bcbs
if
you
like
stouts
or
barrelaged
beers
you
need
to
try
this
its
amazing
what
i
want
is
taste
taste

i
mention

if
you
love
chocolate
its

old
fitzgerald
has
been
my
choice
of
everyday
bourbon
though
the
price
tag
fools
most
looking
for
thee
name
brand
fantastic
bourbon
priced
for
the
working
classim
not
surprised
firestone
went
this
route
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
expensively
sessionable
and
drinking
great
now
overall
this
is
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
i
actually
havent
even
had
velvit
merlin
before
i
need
to
find
some
of
that
its
great
to
have
a
bourbon
barrel
beer
that
i
can
drink
the
whole
bomber
without
getting
drunk
wish
i
was
able
to
get
more
than
one
i
dont
tend
to
drink
boozy
beers
but
i
do
love
it
when
the
extra
alcohol
provides
a
thickness
and
sweetness
that
compliments
but
doesnt
overpower
the
flavors
at
the
front
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
and
id
gladly
have
it
again
but
it
might
be
a
little
overpriced
for
what
it
actually
is
this
goes
to
show
how
the
bourbon
chosen
for
the
stout
makes
a
huge
difference
and
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
personally
believe
that
four
roses
used
for
parabola
is
most
definitely
a
more
refined
bourbon
maker
than
old
fitzgerald
however
im
not
going
to
sit
and
complain
i
recommend
this
as
it
is
an
excellent
barrel
aged
offering
from
fw
if
only
a
little
boozier
than
i
usually
like
it
overall
this
beer
is
the
easiest
to
drink
of
all
the
barrel
aged
proprietors
series
offerings
from
firestone
walker
i
like
to
call
this
one

literally
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
velvet
merlin
was
already
great
and
the
aging
in
bourbon
barrels
just
enhances
every
aspect
of
it
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
thats
gonna
be
around
the

its

overall
the

and
taste
are
very
good
recent

this
might
be
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
verdict
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
from
hill
farmstead
mild
and
balanced
and
oh
so
silky
smooth
the
coffee
profile
is
really
enjoyable
not
overpowering
but
at
the
same
time
not
an
afterthought
it
serves
to
highlight
everything
nice
about
this
beer
rather
than
being
one
dimensional
another
hit
from
hill
farmstead
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
wish
it
was
a
little
more
rich
and
full
bodied
but
nonethless
a
good
beer
picked
this
up
in
a
great
trade
with

gorgeous

nose
with
tons
of
fresh
brewed
coffee
along
with
hints
of
oats
toast
espresso
toffee
burnt

the
taste
is
also
very
coffee
forward
with
tons
of
roasty

toasted
oats
leather
tobacco
toffee
vanilla
espresso
and
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy

with

subtle
sweetness
and
a
velvety
smooth
dry
bitter
finish
overall
some
of
the
most
intense
coffee
flavor
ive
tasted
in
a
coffee
stout
another
great
offering
from
hill
farmstead
very
good
smooth
mouthfeel
well
integrated
flavors
not
necessarily
better
than
other
great
dark
coffee
ales
solid
nothing
special
even
though
i
didnt
end
up
getting
a
growler
of
this
it
was
still
amazingly
tasty

a
very
genuine
coffee
flavor
serving

the
beer
is
dark
brown
near

with
a

of

definitely

true

a
delicious

a
wonderful
oatmeal
coffee
stout
more
than
wonderful
incredible
earls
memory
lives
on
in
ale
form
thats
tall
dark
and
truly
handsome
its
a
stern
demeanor
with
a
reasonable
side
masculine
and
strong
throughout
o
good
stuff
o
overall
a
tasty
well
crafted
coffee
stout
highly
drinkable
though
a
tad
one
dimensional
coffee
runs
the
show
here
but
the
base
stout
brings
some
nice
elements
as
well
great
overall
coffee
complexity
onot
a
knockout
like
some
other
hf
beers
but
earl
is
still
mighty
tasty
i
would
really
enjoy
having
this
year
round
and
accessible
at
the
store
pour
is
black
with
a
tight
mocha
head
nose
is
smooth
roasted
coffee
hint
of
burnt
toffee
with
a
light
vanilla
aroma
taste
is
more
roasty
and
burnt
than
the
nose
lots
of
coffee
and
gets
a
hint
acrid
and
bitter
some
chocolate
malts
cling
to
the
back
sides
of
the
mouth
with
notes
of
vanilla
body
is
incredibly
soft
and
creamy
with
extremely
gentle
carbonation
really
opens
as
it
warms
bringing
out
more
malt
depth
and
richness
balancing
well
with
coffee
and
helping
reduce
the
bitterness
o
very
flavorful
very
good
good
doesnt
blow
me
away
though
the
astringency
in
the
taste
is
a
noticeable
bother
at
first
but
does
seem
to
almost
completely
fade
with
time
overall
this
is
an
earthy
grainy
bitter
chocolate
with
a
coffee
presence
kind
of
beer
not
huge
on
rich
chocolate
roast
vanilla
or
dark
fruit
like
some
can
be
you
have
to
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
and
forget
about
your
expectations
o
overall
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
lots
of
coffee
mixing
nicely
with
chocolate
and
vanilla
easy
to
drink
id
love
to
have
it
again
highly
recommended
if
you
like
coffee
andor
oatmeal
stouts
overall
amazing
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
hill
this
just
proves
that
hf
knows
beer
from
ipa
to
oatmeal
stout
definitely
100
recommend
this
beer
o
glad
to
have
brought
a
bottle
home
with
me
try
it
for
yourself
if
you
can
but
this
is
the
only
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
ben
wowed
by
fantastic
ogetting
a
couple
bottles
of
this
sure
beats
the
3
hours
i
would
have
waited
in
line
for
a
growler
fill
but
my
high
hopes
for
this
werent
quite
met
overall
a
little
disconnected
sweet
and
bitter
both
in
seemingly
disproportionate
quantities
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
a
friend
who
was
heading
up
there
and
willing
to
bring
a
growler
back
for
me
but
unfortunately
this
beer
is
only
available
at
their
farm
in
greensboro
bend
vt
if
youre
ever
within
an
hour
or
two
of
this
place
and
have
the
extra
time
get
out
there
and
grab
a
growler
hill
farmstead
just
cant
help
but
put
up
winner
after
winner
earl
is
no
different
not
the
most
complex
brew
but
this
beer
delivers
exactly
what
it
intends
to
like
smelling
and
drinking
a
mocha
latte
through
and
through
the
body
just
serves
to
enhance
the
experience
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
coffee
oatmeal
stout
not
my
favorite
of
the
variety
as
wnb
is
definitely
better
imo
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
quite
enjoyed
as
with
pretty
much
all
hill
farmstead
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
do
so
oa
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
stout
a
great
sipper
to
enjoy
with
dessert
as
i
stated
before
it
drinks
like
a
porter
its
like
they
took
everett
dumped
a
whole
lot
of
oats
in
it
along
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
and
theres
totally
nothing
wrong
with
that
very
delicious
and
smooth
it
goes
down
way
too
easily
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
however
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
coffee
flavor
it
is
there
but
very
subtle
my
growler
was
filled
1
week
before
being
served
and
was
chilled
the
entire
time
i
dont
think
the
age
of
my
beer
made
the
coffee
fade
o
this
was
a
fantastic
coffeeoatmeal
stout
that
is
exactly
what
i
expected
from
hf
i
could
easily
drink
this
for
breakfast
it
is
a
little
bit
on
the
rich
side
but
other
then
that
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
definitely
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
overall
quite
nice
nice
malt
bill
with
creamy
oats
little
chocolate
caramel
nougat
and
even
hint
of
vanilla
not
sure
how
maybe
just
perceived
from
the
oats
and
chocolate
and
coffee
the
coffee
is
quite
strong
but
not
overpowering
nice
coffee
flavor
that
really
comes
through
the
bitterness
is
nice
too
a
combination
of
roasted
malts
light
earthy
piney
hops
and
roasted
coffee
beans
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
great
beer
is
that
light
bitter
acrid
char
flavor
that
gets
a
little
much
at
times
otherwise
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
stout
absolutely
blows
away
breakfast
stout
in
terms
of
in
your
face
roasted
coffee
delicious
o
again
this
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
coffee
stout
an
all
out
assault
on
coffee
flavors
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
coffee
stout
i
have
had
since
wake
n
bake
i
wish
i
could
do
a
side
by
side
with
these
two
o
overall
this
was
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
good
but
not
my
favourite
that
still
goes
hands
down
to
wormtowns
sweet
tats
o
i
think
this
is
solid
but
in
this
rough
area
of
styles
porter
stout
being
kind
of
interchangeable
today
id
give
the
nod
to
twilight
of
the
idols
and
everett
in
hfs
stable
o
very
very
good
but
doesnt
fit
the
style
absolutely
worth
the
taste
absolutely
worth
the
price
but
expect
a
world
class
porter
clear
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
bubbly
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
thick
lacing
earthy
and
roast
coffee
aroma
with
surprising
amount
of
hops
and
some
faint
chocolate
notes
flavor
is
typical
of
an
oatmeal
stout
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
silky
body
and
a
strong
chocolate
and
malt
body
throughout
minimal
bitterness
but
strong
fresh
coffee
flavor
throughout
much
more
robust
and
enjoyable
experience
than
the
ba
version
of
earl
roasted
barley
and
coffee
aromas
luscious
malt
the
taste
confirms
and
enhances
upon
the
smell
the
rich
creaminess
of
the
oats
is
the
bed
for
the
roasted
flavor
to
lie
upon
laps
of
luxury
from
the
glass
beautiful
creamy
mouthfeel
without
any
acridness
from
the
roast
at
all
terrifically
balanced
overall
another
hill
farmstead
brew
another
beer
right
at
the
top
of
its
class
exceptional
for
a
coffee
stout
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
the
coffee
is
not
too
bitter
but
it
is
highly
present
if
i
were
to
reach
for
a
coffee
stout
this
is
where
i
would
go
to
this
bests
fbs
as
my
favorite
coffee
oatmeal
stout
a
great
offering
from
hill
farmstead
wish
it
was
available
closer
to
me
though
o
fantastic
stout
and
im
lucky
i
got
to
try
this
again
complex
yet
exceptionally
drinkable
adds
great
variety
to
the
hf
portfolio
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
its
solid
but
not
an
upperclass
brew
like
ive
come
to
expect
from
hill
farmstead
too
much
char
for
me
just
didnt
care
a
ton
for
the
flavor
profile
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
o
enjoyable
but
the
thin
body
and
hints
of
coffee
hurt
the
overall
score
of
this
one
wishing
for
more
coffee
and
medium
to
full
body
but
i
guess
i
cant
have
everything
good
not
great
d
its
a
nice
stout
but
not
as
good
as
everett
i
think
id
like
this
if
there
was
more
coffee
presence
o
very
nice
stout
everything
is
good
and
well
balanced
thanks
again
to
the
threpenny
staff
for
a
great
meal
a
couple
of
stellar
beers
and
some
good
beer
chat
cheers
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
some
really
nice
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
some
really
nice
coffee
along
with
some
roast
and
earthy
characteristics
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
background
as
well
as
some
hops
the
flavor
has
nice
coffee
character
along
with
some
roast
chocolate
throughout
mouthfeel
is
really
excellent
and
the
oats
come
through
no
noticeable
booze
really
a
fantastic
stout
earl
look
black
blackie
its
a
black
ale
with
a
little
bit
of
sugar
on
top
with
small
spots
of
lace
up
to
light
earl
look
black
earl
smell
roasty
and
oaty
with
a
deep
sweet
caramel
scent
and
oats
with
chocolate
rounding
it
out
hops
are
present
in
the
nose
its
a
well
rounded
scent
earl
is
one
of
the
richer
oat
stouts
ive
had
recently
notes
of
coccochocolate
mounds
of
oats
and
even
a
mild
hop
bite
towards
the
end
i
get
a
bunch
of
roasted
coffee
with
some
warming
where
did
that
come
from
like
i
said
earl
is
well
rounded
but
he
is
not
fat
with
soaring
alcohol
7
is
fine
with
me
it
drinks
like
it
should
be
more
though
but
thats
what
i
like
a
lot
of
taste
with
not
a
bunch
of
alcohol
feel
is
a
bold
medium
with
adaquate
carb
i
coulda
drank
a
pint
of
this
if
it
was
not
summer
and
it
was
not
the
beginning
of
my
day
i
cant
quite
place
this
it
hits
many
styles
in
one
an
excellent
cdastout
from
the
brewer
at
farmstead
hill
while
i
dont
believe
shaun
hills
ability
as
a
brewer
quite
compares
to
the
genius
of
shawn
kelso
at
barley
brown
hes
awfully
damn
close
just
an
excellent
beer
from
farmstead
hill
this
black
as
midnight
stout
beer
has
a
strong
coffee
aroma
a
slight
tannish
head
indicates
the
beers
stoutness
though
it
is
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
not
overwhelming
thick
its
thick
but
drinkable
the
coffee
flavor
is
more
chocolatey
than
burnt
or
bitter
though
hints
of
burnt
coffee
peak
through
from
time
to
time
it
went
very
well
with
my
portbello
white
bean
burger
at
the
farmhouse
tap
grill
in
burlington
vt
overall
a
really
impressive
coffee
stout
and
the
second
beer
from
hill
farmstead
ive
had
that
i
thought
was
bordering
on
greatness
if
not
there
already
definitely
thrilled
i
had
a
growler
of
this
worth
the
effort
to
get
growler
from
glouglouburp
thanks
again
dany
pours
opaque
cola
with
frothy
two
finger
head
huge
delicious
coffee
nose
slight
chocolate
but
mostly
just
unbelievable
coffee
taste
a
juicy
tart
twang
from
the
oatmeal
slight
bitterness
and
tons
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
fantastic
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
very
light
bodied
but
yet
the
flavour
profile
is
amazing
and
the
freshness
of
the
coffee
really
shiines
through
hf
really
nailed
this
d
pretty
high
i
wish
more
brewery
could
brew
a
well
balanced
stout
like
this
one
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
but
it
was
just
good
not
great
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
drinkability
a
very
nice
take
on
the
stout
as
i
almost
saw
it
as
a
hybrid
stoutrauchbier
with
the
smokiness
in
this
one
md
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
overall
very
nice
i
was
glad
that
the
coffee
wasnt
in
the
forefront
the
sweetness
from
the
oatmeal
was
really
nice
as
was
the
little
bit
of
hops
d
very
nice
beer
smooth
and
well
balanced
chewy
full
body
with
a
great
balance
of
roasted
coffee
bean
silky
luscious
dark
chocolate
oatmeal
toffee
and
bitter
hops
slight
lactic
character
adds
creaminess
and
fullness
to
the
body
and
greatly
increases
the
drinkabilitu
im
actually
surprised
how
well
balanced
this
is
i
was
expected
it
to
be
more
acrid
and
bitter
even
though
the
aroma
didnt
suggest
that
slight
citrus
and
earthy
pine
hops
add
complexity
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
extremely
quaffable
coffee
beer
not
very
extreme
but
damn
good
pleasantly
reminiscent
of
mikkeller
beer
geek
or
the
olbutikken
porter
this
is
a
staple
beer
in
my
fridge
the
last
few
months
d
smooth
coffee
roastiness
very
tasty
goes
down
way
too
easily
this
growler
disappeared
very
quickly
overall
this
is
amazing
drinkable
and
delicious
highly
recommended
and
will
seek
out
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
certainly
one
of
the
better
local
examples
ive
had
of
this
type
of
beer
wish
i
still
had
a
growler
full
of
it
a
stout
with
an
exceptional
nose
pour
is
about
two
fingers
nose
of
toasted
malt
and
rose
water
at
first
this
fades
after
the
first
sip
and
the
true
chalk
burn
coffee
grounds
comes
out
this
combines
with
the
hops
to
leave
a
dead
dry
tongue
beer
isnt
quite
soapy
but
just
a
tad
smoked
acidic
d
this
is
easy
to
drink
quite
tasty
not
sure
the
abv
of
this
but
i
could
certainly
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
another
solid
hf
brew
mmmm
oatmeal
you
make
my
beer
so
smoooth
a
light
pillow
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
with
some
brown
sugar
sprinkled
on
top
coats
the
mouth
the
body
on
this
one
is
less
than
you
expect
when
you
see
it
a
lot
less
in
my
opinion
it
works
well
with
this
beer
though
increasing
the
drinkability
but
i
would
not
think
this
beer
would
age
well
good
integration
of
coffee
but
a
little
light
on
the
body
taste
is
just
like
the
nose
coffee
chocolate
lotsa
brown
suga
its
a
bit
sharp
and
crisp
really
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
warm
and
thick
mouthfeel
its
got
a
nice
rich
mouthfeel
thats
very
tasty
overall
this
was
a
nice
cap
to
our
tasting
night
at
toppling
goliath
it
is
really
kind
of
unfair
that
we
tasted
this
on
the
same
night
as
zee
sue
and
tsunami
but
it
was
certainly
nice
to
see
the
more
malty
roasty
side
they
have
to
offer
the
beer
was
smooth
flavorful
and
easily
approachable
the
oats
and
accompanying
malt
base
was
nicely
singed
at
the
base
making
for
that
fuller
experience
otherwise
the
brew
wasnt
as
memorable
as
their
hoppy
beers
as
weve
already
alluded
to
it
does
hit
the
spot
if
youre
in
the
mood
however
and
the
staff
is
more
than
happy
to
blend
you
up
something
creative
using
this
beer
with
any
others
they
have
available
at
the
time
very
nicesmooth
oatmeal
stout
rather
boilerplate
good
but
boilerplate
but
seeing
as
how
tgs
beers
are
so
reasonably
priced
theres
nothing
wrong
with
releasing
a
run
of
the
mill
stout
had
it
on
tap
once
drinking
from
the
bottle
now
medium
dark
body
with
minimal
head
chocolate
oat
aroma
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
lots
of
cocoa
taste
with
some
roasted
notes
yummy
o
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
that
is
on
the
simplistic
side
i
could
see
this
used
as
a
base
to
add
in
some
other
flavors
such
as
coffee
or
vanilla
enjoyable
for
6
total
3950
rover
truck
is
a
fun
stout
with
lots
of
flavors
to
explore
as
it
warms
it
feels
like
the
roasted
malts
were
laid
on
a
little
thick
and
detract
from
the
experience
of
getting
to
all
the
other
great
flavors
luckily
the
astringency
is
very
low
despite
this
in
fact
all
the
beers
seemed
to
have
a
very
fit
level
of
carbonation
notes
nice
oatmeal
stout
doesnt
necessarily
wow
you
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
nice
chocolate
milk
kind
of
finish
great
creamy
body
o
worth
seeking
out
this
was
delicious
very
thin
mouthfeel
but
this
was
delicious
smelled
and
tasted
like
fresh
coffee
and
cinnamon
rolls
pours
with
a
nice
thick
head
has
a
great
nose
real
cinnamon
roll
smell
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
substantial
taste
is
damn
spot
on
like
a
liquid
cinnamon
roll
bit
yet
im
not
blown
away
tastes
a
bit
muted
in
some
ways
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
it
lacks
a
bit
great
concept
for
a
beer
and
with
a
few
tweaks
could
be
outstanding

i
had
ever
had
some
stouts
have
a
finish
i
describe
as
like
licking
an
ash
tray
this
one
is
different
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
minimal
alcohol
taste
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
and
with
the
higher
abv
sipping
is
the
way
to
drink
it
o
the
best
beer
terrapin
has
ever
produced
that
ive
had
and
ive
had
a
lot
o
enjoyed
this
version
very
much
great
breakfast
beer
picked
this
up
from
a
great
trade
with
evan
while
the
waxed
bottle
looks
cool
its
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
open
pitch
black
pour
with
a
two
finger
caramelcolored
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
fresh
roasted
coffee
dominates
the
nose
along
with
plenty
of
cinnamon
and
vanilla
basically
smells
like
a
cinnabon
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
cinnamon
taking
command
along
with
hints
of
roasty
coffee
dark
chocolate
vanilla
espresso
and
subtle
oats
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
really
creamy
with
a
warm
slightly
dry
finish
overall
the
balance
and
drinkability
really
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
a
syrupy
gimmicky
sugar
bomb
but
instead
got
a
complex
incredibly
balanced
and
delicious
beer
highly
recommended
smooth
rich
slightly
drying
fairly
full
bodied
warming
id
drink
this
any
day
its
terrific
fantastic
moutfeel
aroma
taste
great
version
of
wnb
caliente
with
the
st
patricks
day
terrapin
tap
takeover
boom
o
its
an
improvement
and
nice
change
up
from
the
base
beer
id
probably
reach
for
regular
wnb
more
but
would
definitely
keep
these
on
hand
othis
is
too
sweet
as
the
cinnamon
dominates
the
beer
being
a
big
fan
of
wnb
i
was
hoping
for
the
cinnamon
to
add
something
to
an
already
great
beer
not
take
it
over
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
but
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
flavorwise
as
the
nose
indicated
great
things
the
base
beer
is
better
but
this
is
still
well
worth
trying
imagine
having
a
cup
of
black
coffee
while
eating
vanilla
and
chocolate
ice
cream
and
a
cinnamon
bun
all
at
the
same
time
yes
i
believe
that
accurately
crystallizes
my
thoughts
on
this
fantastic
beer
enough
said
overall
really
a
nice
improvement
on
wnb
which
is
already
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
worth
it
if
youve
never
had
it
in
the
taste
spices
cinnamon
vanilla
and
a
coffee
like
roasted
malt
the
oatmeal
adds
a
breakfast
like
aspect
and
a
smoothness
dark
chocolate
mocha
alcohol
and
sweet
cinnamon
in
the
finish
chocolate
malt
and
cinnamon
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
finish
overall
a
very
delicious
beer
heavy
cinnamon
but
still
nice
this
is
just
amazing
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
sharing
this
gem
thats
as
beautiful
as
it
looks
in
the
bottle
with
bronze
and
white
wax
and
a
classy
and
comical
label
dark
brown
in
color
and
not
overly
heady
but
sitting
with
a
bright
shine
and
just
a
little
icing
of
off
white
head
the
nose
is
the
best
of
a
coffee
oatmeal
stout
with
rich
earthy
coffee
not
super
dark
and
roasted
barley
bitterness
as
well
as
the
semisweet
body
of
the
oats
the
cinnamon
is
a
genius
addition
to
this
that
adds
a
little
kick
to
the
nose
and
ties
the
flavor
together
in
a
unique
way
it
gives
some
texture
to
the
beer
thats
almost
coarse
or
granular
a
nice
contrast
and
challenge
levied
against
the
smoothness
of
this
oaty
creamy
stout
that
would
glide
down
awfully
easy
without
the
cinnamon
it
forces
me
to
slow
down
to
appreciate
this
and
digest
it
in
a
new
way
that
i
dont
always
remember
to
do
when
i
drink
great
beers
sometimes
im
guilty
of
rushing
through
a
great
beer
just
to
get
to
the
next
one
which
is
not
a
good
habit
to
develop
but
this
beer
slowed
me
right
down
and
made
me
focus
on
the
present
in
a
careful
way
which
i
think
i
owe
to
the
cinnamon
the
flavors
marry
beautifully
this
drinks
like
breakfast
full
body
with
some
texture
is
a
nice
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
middle
of
the
road
but
i
wasnt
wishing
for
more
what
i
was
wishing
for
was
another
bottle
in
a
night
that
featured
some
world
class
beers
this
one
was
the
winner
i
have
not
had
nearly
enough
beer
from
terrapin
so
its
hard
to
say
where
this
falls
in
their
line
up
but
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
one
of
the
most
complex
yet
unified
and
one
that
i
will
never
forget
poured
into
snifter
appearance
is
only
pitch
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
appears
like
a
nice
hearty
stout
nose
starts
with
a
huge
dash
of
cinnamon
followed
by
coffee
and
chocolate
cinnamon
takes
center
stage
and
tones
down
the
coffee
a
bit
plenty
of
roast
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
cream
throughout
that
taste
is
delicious
the
cinnamon
is
smooth
and
melds
well
with
the
malty
sweetness
it
really
does
remind
me
a
bit
of
eating
a
cinnamon
roll
beside
a
cup
of
coffee
the
flavors
are
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
cinnamon
addition
definitely
does
something
special
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
and
worth
seeking
out
i
could
only
imagine
what
a
barrel
would
do
to
this
beer
yum
just
when
you
thought
youve
tasted
it
all
a
surprise
comes
your
way
and
shows
all
the
flavors
that
youve
ever
tasted
but
does
so
with
unique
proportions
and
scale
for
a
culmination
thats
both
a
shock
and
a
tease
to
the
taste
buds
quite
a
fun
enjoyable
beer
and
a
great
cinnamon
example
if
not
the
best
use
of
one
in
a
beer
it
does
lack
though
a
classic
creamy
oaty
body
that
i
prefer
to
have
but
still
a
well
put
together
brew
a
wonderful
take
on
one
of
my
personal
favorites
great
interpretation
this
is
a
worthy
pursuit
for
fans
of
imperial
coffee
stouts

me

any

you
could
toss
just
about
any
damn
thing
in
wakenbake
and
have
it
be
good
multiwax
the
limited
release
of
bombers
and
youd
really
have
a
hit
on
your
hands
still
more
than
once
i
found
myself
wishing
i
was
simply
working
through
a
pint
of
the
original
o
this
is
a
really
neat
idea
i
actually
wouldnt
mind
this
being
a
tad
sweeter
its
a
bit
dry
but
still
its
good
glad
i
got
one
of
these
i
think
i
prefer
original
wnb
though
o
good
stout
but
the
cinnamon
competed
with
my
favorite
part
of
wnb
which
is
the
coffee
o
i
think
it
took
me
longer
to
open
the
bottle
than
to
drink
this
delicious
brew
well
done
take
on
wnb
overall
very
good
huge
cinnamon
roll
note
with
tons
of
espresso
very
nice
totally
worth
the
hype
imo
really
a
nice
beer
high
marks
for
achieving
the
flavor
profile
o
overall
im
pretty
floored
by
this
beer
how
can
you
possibly
improve
on
wnb
this
is
how
this
beer
should
become
year
round
in
4
packs
no
6
packs
and
it
should
150
be
distroed
to
long
island
ny
if
that
happens
it
will
be
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
i
am
a
fan
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
o
im
giving
this
one
extra
points
for
uniqueness
and
flawless
execution
cinnamon
rolls
in
my
beer
who
would
have
thunk
it
this
is
on
top
of
an
already
spectacular
base
beer
wnb
is
pretty
damn
good
by
itself
this
adds
complexity
and
uniqueness
without
destroying
the
base
beer
execution
could
not
be
better
in
my
mind
ill
save
a
5
rating
in

and

mouthfeel
overall
ok
again
nothing
exceedingly
memorable
about
this
brew
one
of
my
go
to
stouts
you
can
find
it
in
a
6
pack
or
by
the
pint
for
a
great
price
3
great
flavor
smooth
love
this
stout
i
loved
all
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
the
only
derogatory
mark
was
it
didnt
finish
as
smooth
as
i
would
have
hoped
it
finished
on
the
boozy
side
and
not
as
thick
and
creamy
as
i
had
hoped
for
very
good
will
search
and
buy
more
of
this
definitely
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
like
a
porter
with
roasted
malts
not
much
depth
or
complexity
strong
bite
in
the
beginning
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
then
a
stout
disappointing
because
i
was
wanting
a
stout
nice
stout
good
straight
clean
stout
taste
awesome
o
a
delicious
stout
with
a
great
roasty
character
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
from
the
lcbo
im
glad
they
bring
this
beer
in
overall
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
surprised
to
see
it
here
in
orlando
but
happy
to
have
found
it
not
a
bad
brew
theres
a
slight
burnt
smell
upon
first
sniff
but
its
not
off
putting
it
goes
down
well
and
is
very
sessionable
overall
its
an
a
overall
big
and
bold
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
dark
yet
chugable
another
great
california
ale
could
use
more
carbonation
a
good
effort
and
something
i
would
have
again
8
ball
poured
a
very
deep
brown
colour
verging
on
black
with
about
12
of
creamy
tan
coloured
head
produced
the
head
faded
to
a
thin
cap
of
foam
after
3
minutes
and
left
considerable
spotting
and
some
modest
lacing
all
down
the
glass
its
aroma
was
of
dark
coffee
dark
european
chocolate
and
earthyherbal
hops
8
balls
taste
very
much
followed
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
a
certain
sweetness
which
gave
way
to
a
mildly
bitter
dark
coffee
finish
and
aftertaste
as
the
beer
warmed
there
was
a
bit
of
booze
in
the
finish
which
was
surprising
given
its
5
8
alcohol
content
but
by
no
means
unpleasant
the
only
weakness
of
this
beer
was
its
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
which
contrasted
noticeable
with
the
creaminess
of
the
head
carbonation
level
was
moderate
fully
in
keeping
with
the
style
overall
this
is
a
solid
flavourful
stout
and
not
overly
hoppy
in
the
finish
well
worth
a
try
currently
selling
for
4
80
per
650
ml
bottle
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
impressively
dark
and
opaque
pitch
black
with
just
the
barest
hint
of
a
red
halo
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
surprisingly
sweet
i
get
considerable
caramel
initially
and
then
the
more
expected
dark
roast
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
notes
along
with
a
sour
fruitiness
that
couples
with
the
dark
malts
to
yield
a
pomegranate
molasses
effect
smells
pretty
fantastic
if
not
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
no
real
hop
aroma
tastes
similarly
sweet
and
rich
with
some
diacetyl
apparent
and
an
ultrasmooth
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
chewy
but
not
heavy
and
very
drinkable
with
considerable
residual
sugars
noted
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
very
nice
tactile
translation
of
the
oatmeal
stout
style
characteristics
although
less
dry
and
earthy
than
some
e
g
rogue
shakespeare
stout
samuel
smiths
iconic
example
the
main
flavors
seem
to
be
coffee
with
a
little
cream
light
chocolate
butterscotch
and
the
tiniest
tinge
of
dry
ash
the
booze
is
very
wellconcealed
finish
is
roasty
and
sweet
but
here
some
floral
earthy
hops
become
apparent
cutting
the
sweetness
and
providing
a
contrast
to
the
main
show
i
like
this
a
lot
has
some
sweet
stout
character
and
the
oats
really
do
add
an
amazing
smoothness
then
again
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
the
sweeter
side
of
dark
malt
and
others
may
prefer
something
more
dry
a
straight
forward
oatmeal
stout

a
super
smooth

one
of
the

i
have
tasted
very
drinkable
we
finally
got
some
rain
here
in
san
diego
and
i
went
with
this
brew
for
our
cold
weather
stint
we
have
going
over
here
lost
coast
keeps
it
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
this
isnt
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
its
still
damn
good
in
its
simplicity

and
some

notes
are
also
noticeable
body
is
about
average
with
good

enjoyable
and
easily
drinkable
but
a
bit
short
on
the
complexity
level
enjoy
overall
i
havent
had
an
oatmeal
stout
for
quite
some
time
but
this
one
is
quite
good
id
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
this
again
and
again
a
nice
afterdinner
brew
or
maybe
breakfast
o
outstanding
seriously
buy
this
beer
theres
nothing
aggressive
about
lost
coast
8
ball
stout
its
one
of
the
few
californian
offerings
not
to
make
an
extreme
example
of
this
potentially
dark
and
decadent
style
instead
it
is
a
wonderfully
approachable
agreeable
rendition
its
an
easy
one
to
recommend
o
if
you
dont
mind
a
thinner
body
stout
i
would
give
it
a
shot
this
one
isnt
very
complex
and
wont
be
one
that
i
will
be
returning
to
ps
after
reading
other
reviews
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
as
everyone
else
seems
to
be
having
vastly
different
experience
and
i
share
my
bottle
with
a
friend
and
we
both
didnt
enjoy
it
perhaps
my
review
lacks
the
sophistication
of
others
but
after
tasting
many
porters
and
stouts
8
ball
stout
is
my
number
1
because
of
its
dark
smooth
rich
flavour
to
be
sure
this
stout
has
alluring
complex
tones
in
smell
and
taste
and
for
all
its
boldnesits
dwell
gently
within
overall
i
liked
the
sessionable
and
tasty
aspects
on
this
stout
and
thought
they
were
worked
quite
well
hop
character
could
be
more
interesting
and
forward
i
thought
and
sometimes
they
struggled
to
cut
the
sweet
chocolate
notes
but
this
resolved
itself
i
think
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
for
a
wellmade
stout
not
the
most
interesting
stylistically
but
it
does
drink
quite
nicely
and
is
certainly
well
aboveaverage
4
an
excellent
stout
this
was
a
real
shock
as
i
picked
it
up
in
a
mixed
six
pack
but
it
really
holds
all
the
components
i
look
for
in
a
stout
overall
quite
a
good
beer
and
seeing
that
i
had
never
seen
in
stores
thought
it
was
worthy
of
a
try
glad
i
did
because
its
quite
tasty
and
is
a
nice
bridge
in
the
stout
world
between
the
lower
abv
stouts
and
the
more
serious
imperial
stouts
a
decent
stout
lots
of
dark
malt
and
roasted
barley
flavor
with
a
light
body
to
make
it
quaffable
could
be
a
bit
heartier
in
the
malt
profile
and
the
hopping
rate
but
still
good
stuff
good
brew
for
a
good
price
under
5
at
least
in
ontario
there
are
some
more
distinct
brews
to
be
had
of
this
style
but
this
one
was
certainly
enjoyable
overall
pretty
good
but
there
are
certainly
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
8
ball
is
a
satisfying
stout
that
has
great
drinkability
and
flair
solid
not
must
have
looks
good
smells
and
tastes
ok
overall
its
a
big
meh
it
doesnt
really
excel
in
any
category
the
taste
is
just
not
much
of
anything
very
boring
tastes
like
something
you
would
get
at
a
brew
pub
15
years
ago
its
just
not
big
enough
for
today
or
at
least
not
for
me
overall
this
was
a
good
oatmeal
stout
needs
a
little
more
body
and
a
touch
more
bitterness
for
balance
pours
nearly
black
with
a
very
tiny
tan
head
that
hangs
around
the
whole
time
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
actually
that
settles
ever
so
slowly
back
down
very
nice
aroma
of
coffee
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
lots
of
black
coffee
flavor
right
up
front
on
the
tongue
very
pleasant
overall
with
just
a
slight
bitter
finish
prost
lampertland
o
very
good
but
not
outstanding
across
the
board
my
biggest
gripe
with
oatmeal
stouts
in
general
is
that
they
usually
have
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
with
minimal
flavor
to
back
it
up
here
the
mouthfeel
is
for
sure
thin
but
theres
enough
going
on
that
its
not
bothering
me
while
it
would
probably
be
a
stretch
to
call
this
beer
complex
it
has
enough
subtle

i
could
have
a

of
these
m
not
at

bad
just
a
hair
watery
and
grainy
for
what
i

from
an
american
stout
d
this
is
a
great
beer
on
tap
nicely
blended
some
sharp
flavoring
somewhat
filling
im
a
fan
of
this
one
salud
i
cant
think
of
too
many
situations
where
i
would
crave
a
stout
as
mild
and
watery
as
this
one
simple
and
tasty
works
every
time
it
comes
with
a
nice
dark
body
and
pours
with
a
minimal
head
has
aroma
of
malted
hops
and
coffee
but
surprisingly
enough
i
never
really
get
a
chocolate
taste
or
smell
the
aroma
is
weak
at
best
for
a
stout
its
easy
on
the
mouth
with
a
really
silky
feel
and
swallows
smooth
definately
a
good
one
to
have
a
few
of
and
of
course
me
being
a
local
to
the
brewery
i
for
sure
have
had
a
few
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
taste
i
could
have
a
few
more
however
its
not
as
complex
as
others
ive
had
not
bad
but
not
amazing
poured
a
great
deep

with
just
a
bit
of

head
and
no

deep
burnt

aroma
with
nice
hints
of

very
nice

excellent

grain
with
a
slight
hoppiness
just
a
bit

tinge
a
bit
rough
going
down
from
the
cloudiness
but
still
nice
excellent
stout
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
one
of
lost
coasts
better
offerings
and
will
be
enjoyed
often
this
fall
and
winter
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
will
definately
have
another
in
the
future
sadly
it
was
my
last
one
i
dont
know
decent
certainly
a
good
price
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
but
feels
slightly
misclassified
enjoyable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
tarty
for
my
taste
and
mild
carbonation
12

here
may

for
someone
just
adventuring

beers
or
someone
who
prefers
lighter
styles
poured
into
a
glass
the
beer
is
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
with
no
lacing
the
tiniest
bubbles
come
up
from
the
bottom
the
pungent
sweet
smell
of
molasses
mixed
with
the
tanginess
of
alcohol
rises
up
from
the
beer
to
meet
your
nose
creamy
and
nutty
up
front
with
roasted
malt
followed
by
the
sweetness
of
alcohol
and
a
long
moderately
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
that
reminds
one
of
over
charred
food
pleasant
in
the
mouth
with
full
body
a
decent
stout
but
too
sweet
for
me
a
fan
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
overall
got
this
on
special
as
a
6pack
im
glad
i
did
its
got
enough
body
and
flavour
to
make
it
a
sipper
that
you
could
sip
a
lot
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
frothy
ecru
foam
the
head
lingers
for
a
bit
before
settling
to
a
thin
layer
nose
and
flavor
are
of
dark
roasted
grain
and
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
medium
roast
coffee
beans
pleasantly
bitter
somewhat
light
carbonation
but
still
a
notch
better
than
medium
bodied
tasty
stuff
worth
checking
out
a
good
stout
but
i
would
buy
something
else
for
the
price
damn
wish
this
was
slightly
more
affordable
as
it
is
very
nicely
done
this
is
a
cery
clean
stout
slight
coffee
taste
but
not
too
overpowering
slightly
sour
taste
stays
with
me
but
i
dont
exactly
count
that
as
a
downgrade
basically
this
is
what
guinness
would
be
if
it
were
a
much
better
beer
this
might
be
my
favorite
lost
coast
brew
and
this
might
be
my
current
favorite
american
stout
bye
this
is
a
tasty
stout
with
a
little
bit
of
the
roughness
to
challenge
the
tastebuds
a
drinking
stout
for
sure
but
the
roasted
malt
and
the
finish
is
big
and
pronounced
there
is
a
chocolate
side
to
the
beer
but
the
main
flavour
is
roasty
and
toasty
i
liked
the
fact
that
the
flavour
profile
is
big
and
the
beer
stays
in
your
mind
after
it
is
gone
d
a
really
good
stout
i
like
that
it
is
not
very
sweet
the
taste
lasts
a
good
while
it
is
slightly
filling
md
light
bodied
for
a
stout
a
bit
of
dryness
that
makes
it
not
as
smooth
as
i
like
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
better
mouthfeel
drinkability
seems
a
little
bit
oily
on
the
tongue
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
the
relatively
low
abv
helps
make
this
even
more
drinkable
im
pretty
impressed
by
this
one
the
8ball
on
the
label
made
me
second
guess
before
picking
it
up
im
glad
i
didnt
judge
this
book
by
its
cover
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
stout
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
while
not
sessionable
goes
down
well
im
enjoying
drinking
this
but
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
good
but
not
great
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
for
a
while
had
another
one
last
night
so
thought
i
would
review
it
poured
a
pitch
black
in
my
tulip
glass
like
well
and
eight
ball
a
frothy
tan
head
floated
on
top
smell
was
a
little
chocolately
malt
this
brew
really
shines
with
its
complex
and
ever
changing
flavor
first
poured
its
rather
coffee
dominated
with
a
little
bitter
chocolate
and
a
litte
sweetness
as
it
warms
the
chocolate
starts
to
dominate
and
a
raspberry
or
blueberry
note
comes
into
play
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
and
a
smooth
drinakble
brew
with
all
the
roasted
malt
goodness
going
on
poured
very
dark
almost
black
the
initial
taste
is
a
pleasant
blast
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
it
also
finishes
off
with
a
very
pleasant
and
balanced
blast
of
hops
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
brew
i
find
their
other
brews
generally
unimpressive
but
lost
coast
stepped
up
their
game
on
this
one
its
a
nice
cheaper
alternative
than
the
ole
classic
goto
oatmeal
stoutsam
smith
overall
i
will
definitely
buy
again
felt
that
the
taste
waned
too
easily
for
a
stout
d
tasty
straightup
american
stout
from
lost
coast
with
a
pleasant
chocolate
and
nutty
characteristics
this
would
be
nice
on
nitro
mourhfeel
is
full
and
creamy
one
of
the
best
in
an
american
stout
i
have
had
yet
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
makes
the
beer
smooth
and
thick
chewy
and
creamy
excellent
pretty
good
stuff
i
liked
the
thick
mouthfeel
and
drier
finish
a
nice
solid
stout
that
i
would
certainly
purchase
again
d
not
bad
something
that
i
wouldnt
mind
enjoying
again
somewhat
light
for
a
stout
but
a
good
solid
drink
pours
nice
and
dark
smell
isnt
all
that
strong
but
the
taste
and
drinkability
make
up
for
that
not
my
favorite
but
one
that
i
would
never
turn
down
carbonation
seems
a
bit
lacking
to
me
sometimes
much
better
from
the
tap
then
from
the
bottle
in
my
opinion
d
not
the
most
complex
stout
and
somewhat
mild
in
regards
still
just
a
great
drinker
all
around
and
a
solid
showing
other
comments
this
is
one
of
those
that
takes
you
by
surprise
by
sight
and
smell
its
a
bit
pedestrian
then
you
taste
it
and
you
go
ooh
and
your
eyes
kind
of
widen
sip
sip
sip
and
suddenly
the
beer
is
gone
and
you
feel
a
little
sad
a
pretty
decent
stout
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
but
its
full
in
flavor
and
in
body
a
strong
simple
example
of
an
american
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
with
caramel
edges
a
cocoa
brown
cap
leaves
some
stringy
lacing
as
it
slowly
recedes
the
nose
is
semisweet
chocolate
with
subtle
coffee
notes
this
is
a
surprisingly
complex
stout
tootsie
rolls
and
vanilla
pudding
with
small
amounts
of
hazelnut
coffee
and
citrus
hoppage
this
is
a
winner
the
body
is
full
of
lifecreamy
bitter
and
tickling
the
taste
buds
from
start
to
finish
damn
close
to
the
most
drinkable
stout
ive
ever
had
pretty
good
stout
from
a
great
brewery
pours
an
attractive
black
color
with
decent
tan
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
thin
film
along
the
top
pleasant
aroma
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malts
flavor
is
the
same
and
very
balanced
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
oily
black
pour
with
a
miniscule
tan
head
not
really
all
that
sweet
for
being
a
supposed
sweet
stout
but
rather
very
malty
and
flecked
with
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
everything
just
runs
together
perfectly
in
this
one
and
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
because
of
the
low
abv
and
on
many
nights
i
have
done
just
that
the
milky
and
smooth
feel
is
almost
too
drinkable
for
a
stout
this
is
a
smooth
sweetish
drinkable
stout
milky
and

a
terrific
stout
dark
black
pour
with
no
head
aroma
of
chocolate
and
caramel
with
some
burnt
coffee
taste
is
smooth
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
and
strong
but
with
a
bitter
finish
not
too
heavy
to
border
on
the
imperial
a
sweet
stout
that
keeps
to
its
roots
as
a
stout
instead
of
being
a
weak
imperial
out
of
bottle
that
was
a
lovely
birthday
gift
this
beer
was
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
tan
head
short
on
the
retention
but
some
scattered
streaks
of
lacing
from
the
thin
ring
the
aroma
was
dry
roasted
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavors
were
very
similar
with
the
addition
of
some
alcohol
heat
and
a
bitter
slightly
acidic
finish
that
lingered
on
and
on
classic
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
off
for
me
because
i
though
the
medhigh
carbonation
a
little
too
much
for
the
style
otherwise
however
it
was
full
and
on
point
for
the
style

buy
it
again
in

d
pretty

a
mild
dose
of

hops

bodied
and
quite
smooth
from
the

overall

good
this
is
a
nice
little
stout
that
i
could
definitely
see
myself
sampling
more
of
in
the

nice

still
a
light
easydrinking

roasted

bitter
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
smoke
a
bit
low
on
hop
aroma
which
is
a
signature
of
american
stout
taste
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
roast
malts
dark

and
in
the
background
some
notes
of
red
wine
like
a

bitterness

low

flavor
nice
full

somewhat
dry
leaving
you
yearning
for
more
of
those
wonderful
flavors
watch
out
for
this
big
boy
at
6
abv
this
is
an
very
tasty
stout
and
if
they
ramped
up
the
hops
a
bit
this
would
be
a
picture
perfect
american
stout
easy
drinking
stout
not
overpowering
so
if
you
are
looking
to
drink
many
and
want
something
more
than
a
guinness
this
is
a
nice
choice
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
stout
doesnt
overload
you
with
sweetness
or
heaviness
which
makes
it
more
poundable
than
most
stouts
its
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
black
with
a
tan
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
some
very
heavily
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
sweetslightly
bitter
mix
between
milk
and
dark
chocolate
and
ends
with
some
coffee
flavor
the
mouthfeel
has
some
nice
thickness
with
surprisingly
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
it
would
probably
be
a
good
intro
beer
to
someone
who
doesnt
think
they
like
dark
beers
not
a
bad
stout
but
a
little
above
a
good
session
level
a
good
mix
of
the
burnt
malt
and
roasty
coffee
flavors
very
enjoyable
if
you
like

had

up

when
i
was
a
kid
with
an
8
ball
on
the
shifter
i
thought
he
was
the
coolest
he
was
so
is
this
delicious
stout
from
lost
coast
well
done
beer
similar
to
a
rogue
chocolate
stout
but
backs
off
alot
on
the
ibus
2
d
too
tangy
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
ipa
or
apa
ill
go
for
a
good
ipa
or
apa

of
the
best
domestic

on
the
shelf
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
dense
tan

arome
is
medium
sweet
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
mildly
smoky
and
has
a
nice
roasted

with

smoothness
and
just
the

good
stuff
not
great
but
quite
good
pretty
good
stout
id
drink
it
again
drinks
easy
not
a
great
stout
but
worth
a
few
pints
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
pretty
good
nothing
offensive
about
it
at
all
and
it
goes
down
easy
at
just
over
6
i
could
drink
a
few
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
dark
coffee
brown
as
it
pours
into
the
glass
with
a
quickly
dissipating
creamy
tan
head
not
much
aroma
at
all
just
a
bit
of
toasted
not
quite
burnt
barley
more
carbonation
than
in
many
oatmeal
stouts
i
look
for
oatmeal
stouts
to
be
creamy
this
one
isnt
taste
is
decidedly
nonsweetin
fact
its
almost
savorysalty
not
especially
bitter
either
the
finish
is
nicely
dry
and
the
aftertaste
is
nicely
roasty
making
the
best
part
of
drinking
this
beer
the
few
seconds
after
swallowing
i
love
stouts
and
while
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
drink
em
if
ya
got
em
very
easy
to
drink
but
id
like
to
drink
something
that
pleases
me
more
but
thatss
just
me
i
would
recommend
this
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
at
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
m
d
a
little
lighter
bodied
carbonation
is
also
tame
maybe
a
better
cask
performer
not
much
going
on
decent
overall
and
i
like
it
but
not
often
mediocre
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
malty
but
very
dry
like
unsweetened
caramel
the
carbonation
is
subtle
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
would
be
an
amazing
session
beer
more
please
excellent
interpretation
of
a
stout
there
is
a
little
bit
of
everything
but
it
all
works
together
body
is
light
and
narrowly
avoids
becoming
watery
im
not
saying
its
mind
blowing
or
expanding
new
horizons
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
recommended
nice
but
unidimensional
roasted
malt
aroma
opens
to
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
pleasant
but
not
very
deep
or
complex
taste
mainly
composed
of
roasted
malts
some
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
all
in
all
a
decent
stout
tastes
of
roasted
malts
chocolates
and
a
pretty
noticeable
bitterness
in
a
good
way
i
found
it
a
little
thin
but
still
creamy
if
that
makes
sense
very
drinkable
medium
to
thick
body
with
lowish
carbonation
add
to
the
smoothness
that
the
flavour
brings
definitely
an
easy
drinking
stout
no
complaints
when
this
is
in
my
glass
d
kinda
bland
in
a
wierd
way
not
even
sure
how
to
describe
it
i
wouldnt
even
think
a
stout
could
be
made
to
taste
this
little
very
drinkable
a
good
stout
seemed
to
be
easy
to
sip
or
have
a
couple
without
much
trouble
its
been
a
long
while
since
i
had
a
good
solid
stout
i
am
quite
pleased
with
this
offering
and
hope
to
try
again
soon

if
this
was

in

i
would
try
to
always
have
a

on
hand
i
had
this
in
portland
and
didnt

anything
goodnor

it
at
the
time
maybe
this
bottle
is
a
fluke
if
i
have
another
opportunity
to
try
it
out
i
will
and
if
my
future
experience
is
different
ill
update
it
otherwise
it
stands
d
there
is
nothing
really
limiting
the
sessionability
of
this
beer
although
it
didnt
really
wow
me
d
if
this
was
a
local
offering
id
drink
it
often
thanks
to
tayner
for
this
one
this
poured
opaque
black
with
only
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
molasses
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
malts
with
some
toasted
oatmeal
sweetness
it
tasted
like
a
good
mix
of
dark
chocolate
and
robust
roasted
coffee
although
the
flavor
faded
some
as
i
drank
it
it
was
watery
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
bitter
but
short
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
solid
stout
that
was
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
try
a
thicker
and
more
powerfully
flavored
imperial
big
brother
to
this
beer
not
a
great
stout
by
any
means
but
decent
enjoyable
brew
if
you
like
the
chocolate
stout
taste
overall
this
would
be
a
more
drinkable
stout
if
it
werent
more
than
six
percent
alcohol
a
more
vigorous
pour
would
probably
have
smoothed
out
this
brew
i
imagine
a
draft
version
might
be
more
impressive
in
the
bottle
i
think
this
compares
to
trader
joes
stockyard
oatmeal
stout
which
can
be
for
3
less
a
sixpack
in
my
area
pretty
disappointed
in

oatmeal
stout
sorry
guys
nice
black
opaque

with

wasnt
the
strongest
but
was
nicely
of
roastiness
some
coffee
and
definite
sweetness
present
too
taste
was
roasty
light
coffee
flavor
and
fairly
sweet
overall
with
a
light
bitterness
and
light
chalky
drying
finish
to
it
medium
to
thick
body
but
medium
to
high
carbonation
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
even
though
its
more
carbonated
that
expected
a
really
nice
sweet
stout
worth
getting
mouth
feel
is
rather
disappointing
considering
the
thick
look
when
poured
and
the
very
dark
color
i
guess
i
made
an
assumption
there
is
a
slight
amount
of
carbonated
bite
but
not
alot
of
complex
flavors
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
i
found
this
beer
a
little
watery
despite
all
the
other
characteristics
overall
an
excellent
easytodrink
stout
that
is
full
of
flavors
but
not
overly
harsh

and

and
head
roasted

and
bitter
chocolate
malt
nose
with
some
sweet
vanilla

same
in
the
taste
along
with
a
light
fresh
ground
coffee
bitterness
that
finishes
a
bit
dry
a
watery
medium
body
has
some
large
bubbled
carbonation

decent
offering

the
style

and
pac
nw
hops
it
appears
jetblack
with
medium
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
yellowedcocoa
head
that
delivers
nice
lacing
the
bouquet
is
roasted
chocolatey
and
hoppy
but
is
a
bit
subdued
not
too
flavorful
when
cold
but
as
it
warms
it
reveals
notes
of
citric
hops
backed
by
charred
and
chocolate
malts
hints
of
coffee
and
dark
fruits
however
it
is
a
bit
watery
and
seems
fully
attenuated
needs
a
bit
of
sweetness
for
balance
the
body
is
light
too
thin
for
the
style
i
feel
with
high
carbonation
quite
dry
and
imparts
a
medium
finish
overall
its
not
too
bad
but
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
almost
harsh
when
served

black

whatsoever

carbonation
is
quite
low
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth

dry
very
drinkable
even
with
the
somewhat
high
alcohol
which
by
the
way
is
not
obvious
from
the
taste
pretty
good
definitely
will
be
a
goto
beer
if
im
in
he
mood
for
a
nice
thick
flavorful
stout
the

abv
also
means
that
one
will
do
ya
but
one
or
two
more
arent
going
to
kill
you
i
like
it
i
would
definitely
want
to
have
this
beer
again
and
would
recommend
it
dark

notes
at

there

the

at

there
are

flecks
floating

but
isnt
strong
enough
there
is
a
touch
of
roasted

and
maybe
a
touch

not

and
decent

d
very

stout
i
tend
to
like
things
from

coats
it
was
very
drinkable
not
to
heavy
but
enough
flavor
to
make
it
enjoyable
overall
a
great
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
for
this
style
certainly
wont
have
any
trouble
getting
through
this
sixpack

will
buy
again
in
the
near

with
a
fine

great

a

of

aftertaste
is
of
dark
roasted

and
almost
a
yeasty
finish
d
this
is
one
bitter
stout
it
is
one
dimensional
and
uninteresting
i
will
leave
it
on
the
shelf
for
someone
who
likes
a
bitter
brew
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
d
will
be
buying
again
and
recommend
as
a
good

pours
an

an
ample

and
some

this
is
one
very
nicely
well

i
will
drink
again
drinkability
im
done
trying
this
beer
the
grimyness
and
overly
burnt
taste
pushes
me
away
from
this
i
bought
two
bottles
of
this
in
indiana
last
year
this
is
the
first
i
have
opened
looking
forward
to
the
2nd
d
it
isnt
awful
but
i
dont
think
i
will
have
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
really
bad
it
is
an
okay
beer
i
could
see
someone
else
liking
it
but
it
is
definitely
not
for
me
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
its
refreshing
to
see
a
brewer
especially
one
on
the
left
coast
to
still
be
making
a
stout
without
imperializing
it
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
lost
coast
but
they
need
to
clean
up
the
ferment
a
bit
those
fruity
flavors
have
got
to
go
without
them
this
could
be
a
damn
good
stout
i
think
id
buy
it
again
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
for
more
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
whispy
fizzy
tan
head
and
good
lace
the
aroma
suggests
charcoalsmoke
malt
and
brown
sugar
it
has
a
smooth
feel
with
light
carbonation
and
a
cherryraisin
flavor
that
often
masks
the
malt
qualities
a
bit
it
finishes
with
a
pretty
heavy
bitterness
but
remains
fairly
drinkable
for
a
stout
i
detected
some
buttery
hints
despite
the
tangy
overtones
its
kind
of
different
definitely
recommended
for
a
try
3

hopmaltchocolateoatmeal
had
2
cooler
ones
later
on
with
my
lovely
friend
then
finished
the
final
3
later
at
home
definitely
not
onedimentional
a
little
astringent
d
could
anything
be
more
drinkable
this
is
mellow
creamy
complex
and
it
doesnt
tax
your
taste
buds
over
the
course
of
a
session
not
the
heaviest
hitting
stout
but
one
of
the
most
tasty
and
drinkable
imo
the
mouthfeel
hit
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
didnt
stay
long
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
love
it
good
solid
sense
of
roasted
malts
perhaps
the
most
striking
thing
is
the
coffee
tones
that
it
delivers
there
is
a
fairly
faint
sense
of
chocolate
more
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
it
pours
a
thick
creamy
head
smells
nice
not
as
strong
as
i
might
like
but
good
this
i
believe
is
the
first
beer
i
have
had
from
the
lost
coast
brewery
cafe
they
have
certainly
earned
themselves
onto
my
list
of
breweries
to
look
out
for
pours
an
opaque
black
with
deep
orange
edges
and
a
half
inch
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
bitterness
tastes
of
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
bitterness
with
some
hop
notes
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
velvety
from
the
oats
although
a
little
on
the
thin
side
very
smooth
and
stays
on
your
tongue
overall
a
tasty
and
robust
stout
id
have
again
this
was
an
oily
black
pour
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
smoky
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smoky
which
works
well
for
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
a
bit
chewy
overall
i
think
that
the
taste
is
interesting
and
compelling
i
prefer
heavier
beers
and
consider
this
to
be
very
drinkable
pitchblack
motor
oil
in
color
with
a
34
inch
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
slight
collar
missing
some
of
that
big
creamy
cap
that
i
see
with
other
stouts
a
big
sniff
presents
brown
sugar
molasses
a
touch
of
butterscotch
and
a
tad
of
bittersweet
chocolate
though
i
am
no
stout
pro
by
any
means
it
strikes
me
as
a
bit
of
a
departure
first
sip
right
off
i
get
some
of
that
brown
sugar
and
toffeelike
characteristics
but
the
middle
is
a
strong
fruitiness
some
berry
and
am
i
crazy
here
some
raisin
finishes
with
a
quick
slap
of
liquorice
and
the
faintist
hint
of
chocolate
im
stumped
honestly
it
seems
to
have
more
in
common
with
a
dubbel
or
quad
than
a
stout
all
of
the
quintessential
things
i
would
look
for
are
absent
and
then
to
compound
the
crime
it
resembles
a
belgian
but
not
a
very
good
one
either
body
is
medium
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
or
hoppy
tingle
a
bad
bottle
maybe
i
cant
tell
but
i
am
very
much
underwhelmed
this
is
the
wimpiest
stout
i
have
ever
drank
if
you
are
a
wimp
beer
drinker
and
go
for
the
girly
drinks
youll
love
it
i
had
to
stop
and
double
check
that
i
wasnt
drinking
bud
light
for
my
stout
taste
nothing
compares
to
guinness
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
one
d
a
good
drinking
stout
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
d
a
wise
choice
for
those
who
like
a
dry
roasty
stout
an
extremely
smooth
roasted
and
drinkable
stout
in
every
sense
black
in
color
almost
no
light
gets
through
the
mug
cream
colored
head
which
dissapates
fairly
quickly
with
very
little
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
hints
of
spiced
fruits
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
strong
coffee
flare
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
kick
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
it
is
fairly
thick
it
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
easy
to
sip
on
but
1
bomber
seems
to
be
enough
i
would
think
that
lost
coast
has
better
offering
than
this
stout
d
fantastic
for
all
the
reasons
i
mentioned
in
a
word
smooth
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
great
sweet
chocolate
and
malt
taste
d
all
in
all
a
good
stout
i
will
probaly
drink
this
again
ranks
slightly
above
average
in
the
category
good
carbonation
that
works
in
an
interesting
fashion
with
the
almost
fruitlikeyeasty
qualities
in
the
finish
pretty
good
throughout
different
and
unexpected
but
likable
this
is
a
nice
stout
the
drinkability
as
with
any
stout
grows
with
warming
at
low
temps
this
beer
is
good
yet
not
outstanding
after
warming
a
bit
like
any
good
stout
it
grows
in
flavor
with
very
heavey
malt
flavors
n
some
oatmeal
flavors
with
a
touch
of
chockolate
it
is
a
good
change
up
in
stouts
once
again
when
it
comes
to
good
beers
you
get
what
you
pay
for
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
pours
up
thick
with
a
small
head
and
very
dark
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
great
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
wonderful
a
must
try
if
you
like
stouts
d
decent
taste
but
too
acidic
to
drink
a
lot
of
d
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
d
extremely
complex
for
a
smaller
stout
drinkibility
is
high
and
has
a
medium
body
for
a
stout
i
lliked
this
brew
but
it
lacked
in
the
finishing
department
recommended
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brownblack
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
nice
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
slight
roasted
feel
and
mostly
toffeecaramel
with
a
nice
touch
of
chocolate
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
exceptional
stout
very
true
to
style
a
medium
bodied
stout
but
it
has
so
much
going
on
this
is
one
of
the
most
perfectly
balanced
stouts
in
my
opinion
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
whatever
your
drinking
speed
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
black
as
hell
pitch
black
with
a
fluffy
carmel
colored
head
that
leaves
thick
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
bitter
bread
with
hints
of
choco
in
the
whiff
taste
is
very
malty
and
bready
with
a
bit
of
a
alcohol
burn
this
is
one
fine
tasting
has
a
coffee
aftertaste
which
i
enjoy
greatly
this
is
my
favorite
brew
from
lost
coast
and
savor
each
and
every
time
i
enjoy
this
american
classic
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
as
creamy
chocolaty
as
the
smell
the
6
3
abv
is
well
hidden
a
good
drinker
thanks
to
wsatch
for
this
sample
heavy
carbonation
masks
the
taste
initially
but
eventually
a
roasted
well
balanced
flavor
emerges
but
this
beer
could
still
use
a
kickstart
aftertaste
is
dry
and
warming
and
certainly
saves
a
bit
of
face
for
this
otherwise
weak
anonymous
stout
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
smooth
ill
give
this
another
shot
in
a
few
months
or
so
but
a
bit
disappointing

drinkability
very

nothing

quite
quaffable

a
nice

the

and
the
tastes

but
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
match
up
though
not
what
id
consider
a
typical
stout
tastewise
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
one
i
think
its
quite
accessable
and
would
especially
appeal
to
those
not
as
keen
on
the
heavier
stouts
plus
its
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
for
those
of
us
who
do
like
all
kinds

the

but
with

at

this
is
strictly
a

apparent
mouthfeel

very

this
is
a
very
nice
american
stout
not
really
heavy
and
that
lends
this
one
to
being
very
drinkable
and
session
worthy
this
isnt
going
to
wow
you
but
it
is
good
and
enjoyable
d
ive
had
quite
a
bit
of
imperial
and
double
stouts
of
late
so
it
is
nice
to
have
a
subtle
wellroasted
stout
that
doesnt
knock
me
out
mouthfeel
drinkabilty
this
beer
is
very
smooth
the
beer
has
no
over
the
top
flavors
or
smells
this
is
a
very
fine
stout
and
if
i
had
access
this
could
easily
become
a
regular
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
solid
offering
a
very
good
but
not
great
stout
in
my
view
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
to
go
beyond
one
same
very
dark
and
very
thick
look
not
much
head
but
then
that
is
a
problem
with
draft
pours
they
try
to
give
your
your
moneys
worth
so
carefully
fill
it
to
the
brim
nose
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
little
fruit
there
too
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
silky
the
flavor
is
mostly
dark
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
really
tasty
and
i
cannot
tell
any
differerce
between
this
and
the
bottled
brew
meh
not
too
hot
and
a
little
too
much
of
a
sting
for
me
drinkability
bold
but
thats
about
it
the
carbonation
the
amount
of
sweets
and
the
slightly
strange
finish
are
my
big
cons
my
pros
are
that
this
is
a
fine
lil
stout
wich
should
give
no
one
any
reason
to
pout
good
good
good
better
good
not
bad
but
this
is
a
fairly
straightforward
stout
decent
but
disappointingly
unremarkable
a
fine
beer
moderate
carbonation
with
a
smooth
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
d
smooth
and
tasty
this
one
is
a
winner
ive
never
thought
of
stouts
as
a
sessions
beers
but
this
one
could
pass
as
one
recommended
im
glad
that
faro
sent
two
d
not
too
strong
very
drinkable
good
beer
pours
an
absolutely
obsidian
black
with
a
small
contrasting
white
head
i
was
actually
expecting
a
dryer
stout
but
this
one
was
pleasantly
sweet
in
both
aroma
and
flavour
without
taking
on
some
of
the
cloying
aspects
of
some
strong
milk
or
caribbean
extra
stouts
definite
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
though
with
some
good
unsweetened
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
elements
super
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
polished
off
a
bomber
of
this
on
my
own
d
eh
as
stouts
go
its
not
very
um
stout
has
a
strange
fruity
hoppiness
that
doesnt
really
match
up
well
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
ill
give
it
another
try
at
a
later
date
but
i
was
pretty
underwhelemed
by
this
one
drinkability
an
agreeable
light
easy
drinking
light
stout
certainly
not
jawdropping
in
my
book
but
its
a
decent
stout
overall
d
very
drinkable
stout
this
one
is
almost
on
the
verge
of
being
a
risthere
are
spicy
notes
in
there
that
make
me
think
this
this
is
one
fine
stout
with
one
fine
mouthfeel
highly
recommended
i
liked
this
a
lot
mouthfeel
is
just
about
spot
on
perfect
levels
of
carbonation
up
front
and
in
the
finish
to
balance
the
thick
body
leaves
my
mouth
clean
not
cloying
has
ample
body
to
let
you
know
youve
graduated
from
heineken
to
a
real
mans
beer
but
balanced
enough
that
you
can
drink
it
after
a
hot
day
mowing
the
lawn
what
i
just
got
done
doing
or
all
night
long
out
with
your
boys
really
a
terrific
stout
i
will
certainly
be
buying
this
one
again
d
this
has
won
me
over
as
the
best
stout
in
the
world
i
didnt
think
it
could
get
much
better
than
obsidian
but
this
one
blows
it
out
of
the
water
i
could
drink
these
all
day
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
than
this
is
a
must
have
carbonation
only
medium
and
the
strength
of
the
beer
was
pretty
impressive
one
or
two
bottles
will
keep
you
rather
happy
for
an
evening
especially
since
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
drinkability
didnt
like
it
much
at
all
way
to
much
of
a
coffee
flavor
for
me
enjoyable
not
overly
heavy
and
very
drinkable
appearance
is
very
dark
w
a
brown
head
smells
kind
of
sweet
w
a
coffee
type
smell
behind
it
tastes
very
malty
w
some
chocolate
aftertastes
overall
this
is
just
above
average
in
my
opinion
its
not
bad
just
nothing
special
the
chocolate
is
a
bit
much
for
me
i
think
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
well
balanced
but
this
sample
seems
a
little
mild
was
expecting
something
much
roastier
this
example
just
seems
subdued
taste
pretty
halfandhalf
like
malts
to
start
with
teh
middle
allowing
more
coffee
mocha
chocolate
and
spent
grain
flavor
to
hit
with
the
finish
bringing
all
these
flavors
together
and
a
well
maintained
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
really
good
beer
chocolate
barely
loses
the
battle
to
the
hops
at
the
finish
black
color
sweet
aroma
with
good
maltiness
nuts
coffee
and
salty
licorice
the
taste
is
dryer
but
still
fullbodied
with
coffee
licorice
and
hops
the
finish
is
charredroasted
with
hints
of
nuts
not
as
good
as
the
initial
flavor
on
the
palate
but
still
excellent
pours
dark
brown
with
thick
dark
head
rich
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
espresso
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
is
quite
sweet
a
very
smooth
yet
bold
stout
that
i
could
drink
any
time
if
you
havent
already
pour
one
of
these
over
some
vanilla
ice
cream
for
an
8
ball
stout
float
lost
coast
recommends
this
on
the
bottom
of
their
six
packs
and
for
good
reason
the
nose
is
full
of
heavy
roasted
malts
sweet
coffee
and
a
light
caramel
essence
the
taste
is
of
rich
and
sweet
espresso
it
is
also
very
smoothe
for
a
stout
and
doesnt
have
the
common
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
overall
pleasant
and
since
it
isnt
too
rich
it
is
possible
to
enjoy
of
small
session
of
these
without
worrying
about
that
heavy
stout
buildup
a
rich
flavorfull
complex
stout
not
an
imperial
but
in
the
realm
of
single
stouts
this
one
is
very
good
good
session
stout
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
hope
i
get
to
revisit
this
beer
again
its
an
excellent
stout
black
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
aromas
are
a
combination
of
dark
and
milk
chocolate
with
touches
of
dark
fruit
and
the
slightest
hint
of
molasses
some
mild
chocolate
flavors
are
present
along
with
some
assertive
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
dark
crystal
malt
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
no
surprises
d
very
interesting
to
taste
a
stout
that
lets
you
taste
the
hops
easy
to
drink
especially
since
any
bitterness
or
sourness
from
burnt
malts
arent
evident
at
all
black
as
the
inside
of
an
owls
beak
during
enclosure
small
milk
chocolate
head
of
foam
with
an
aroma
of
chocolate
roast
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
resiny
and
fruity
hops
big
roasted
malt
taste
bring
forth
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
i
often
feel
in
an
overwhelmed
state
of
redundancy
when
i
describe
the
flavor
of
stouts
but
this
particular
one
has
a
very
appealing
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
especially
on
the
finish
nicely
balanced
well
done
and
served
at
a
good
temperature
damned
fine

really
nice
stout

lots
of
flavour
very
good
nice
dry
roasted
finish
very
well
balanced
quite
soft
yet
assertive
at
the
same
time
man
i
wish
i
got
to
try
more
of
this
very
drinkable
particularly
for
its
strength
12
ounce
twistoff
impenetrable
black
with
chestnut
highlight
at
the
bottom
of
the
pint

sticky
and
thick

faint

after
brief
scent
of
piney

big

beautiful
balance
of

and

hops
a
sweet

meets
bitter
orange
flavor
at
the
finish
absolutely
delicious
oatmeal
adds
a
silken
texture
to
this
mediumbodied
and
velvety
smooth
stout
great
achievement
and
supersessionable
definitely
will
buy
again
got
this
on
vacation
down
in
orlando
wish
it
was
available
in
stl
drinkability
really
really
high
for
a
stout
most
stouts
have
either
a
harshness
which
is
good
but
limits
drinkability
or
are
too
basic
this
one
isnt
harsh
and
its
pretty
complex
the
6
3
alcohol
is
enough
to
provide
a
bit
of
a
kick
without
venturing
into
imperial
terriotory
yeah
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
sixer
next
time
medium
thick
and
very
dark
sweet
stout
slight
bitterness
from
the
roasting
coffee
taste
with
a
little
chocolate
overtone
to
me
a
very
balance
stout
very
easy
to
drink
not
super
filling
but
moderately
heavy
i
would
pick
up
a
6
of
these
on
a
regular
basis
good
food
beer
note
allergies
colored
this
review
to
a
small
degree
as
my
nose
is
a
little
stuffy
will
definitely
review
again
in
the
future
this
beer
smells
of
chocolate
chicory
and
coffee
poured
it
into
my
boot
mug
and
the
head
was
huge
and
strong
tan
colored
with
lots
of
lacing
as
it
receded
color
is
opaque
dark
brown
great
stout
flavor
with
a
more
sweet
then
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
higher
abv
is
almost
non
detectable
this
brew
is
pure
flavor
i
could
enjoy
many
of
these
beers
as
it
is
very
smooth
from
start
to
finish
the
price
was
ideal
50
off
a
sixer
at
my
local
mercado
i
will
enjoy
immensely
hope
they
restock
d
drinkability
isnt
bad
for
this
brew
its
a
pleasing
stout
but
it
could
have
been
much
better
with
more
sweetness
to
balance
to
burntsourness
of
the
dark
malts
i
would
still
recommend
trying
this
one
md
the
carbonation
subtle
yet
present
delving
an
flavorful
and
complex
brew
that
fells
even
across
the
palate
allowing
the
various
parts
of
the
tong
to
experience
the
beer
completely
differently
the
finish
is
almost
too
dry
but
the
drinkability
is
not
impacted
i
really
enjoyed
the
mix
easy
drinking
a
bit
chalky
but
overall
nice
the
drinkability
is
good
the
flavour
stays
mild
and
delicious
it
compels
me
to
take
another
pull
without
becoming
heavy
and
tiresome
to
consume
very
tasteful
and
well
balanced
my
first
lost
coast
experience
and
it
was
a
good
one
indeed
cheers
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
limited
by
its
thickness
however
all
in
all
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
id
had
it
in
my
cellar
for
about
6
months
glad
i
decided
to
pull
it
out
pours
black
ruby
red
around
the
top
when
held
to
the
light
very
little
head
with
some
lacing
smells
of
espresso
with
a
hint
of
licorice
initial
taste
of
soy
that
decreases
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
alcohol
does
not
jump
out
at
you
medium
to
full
body
the
mouthfeel
starts
thin
but
improves
as
the
beer
warms
up
this
is
very
smooth
making
this
a
very
easy
to
drink
overall
an
enjoyable
stout
that
i
would
drink
again
initial
serving
was
to
cold
i
could
probably
put
back
a
sixer
of
this
easily
in
a
night
if
i
felt
so
inclined
this
is
great
beer
a
little
too
mellow
in
the
flavor
category
to
be
an
amazing
beer
though
pours
almost
black
with
a
nice
tan
headand
pleanty
of
lacing
smell
is
roastedbut
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
taste
is
maltywith
a
nice
edge
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
light
for
a
stoutbut
still
full
flavored
very
drinkable
i
recommend
this
beer
the
taste
is
as
you
expect
form
the
aroma
more
roasted
coffee
with
hops
giving
it
the
bitterness
i
want
a
bit
more
punch
here
this
is
a
very
easy
stout
to
drink
quite
watery
and
too
carbonated
for
my
tastes
in
a
stout
not
impressed
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
bit
harsh
the
hops
leave
your
tongue
stinging
and
the
smoke
leaves
your
throat
feeling
a
little
raw
dark
mahogany
colored
with
a
low
beige
head
aroma
of
bitter
chocolate
laced
with
chicory
and
cherry
a
bit
of
molasses
and
some
smoke
flavor
is
cocoa
espresso
dark
molasses
some
charred
bark
and
a
cherry
tartness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
low
carbonation
a
bit
tannic
and
chalky
not
rich
or
full
average
drinkability
this
stout
had
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
typical
head
the
bouquet
was
originally
weak
but
even
after
warming
up
the
aromas
never
fully
came
out
the
most
obvious
thing
i
noticed
was
the
carbonation
it
was
too
harsh
for
a
stout
despite
the
almost
nonexistent
bouquet
the
flavors
were
pronounced
with
hints
of
caramel
coffee
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
mediocre
due
to
the
carbonation
and
a
watery
consistency
i
think
this
is
a
very
typical
micro
stout
unfortunately
from
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
this
is
as
black
as
beer
gets
a
small
light
brown
head
disappears
rapidly
leaving
no
lacing
behind
the
aroma
is
big
roasted
malts
espresso
chocolate
and
bitter
hops
the
flavor
is
very
nice
the
roasted
malts
give
this
a
sweet
chocolaty
coffee
flavor
up
front
while
the
generous
amount
of
hops
provides
more
then
usual
acidity
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
somewhat
smoky
carbonation
is
highish
making
the
mouthfeel
smooth
without
being
dull
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
thank
you
lost
coast
this
is
why
i
love
you
so
whats
left
to
say
8ball
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
full
body
to
it
if
nit
picking
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
would
prefer
more
of
a
robust
character
but
for
its
style
and
what
im
judging
it
fits
very
well
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
because
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
in
line
with
what
people
are
saying
but
i
call
it
like
i
see
it
impressed
the
price
of
this
one
is
not
too
bad
at
all
pretty
good
flavor
and
right
on
style
not
one
beam
of
light
is
able
to
penetrate
the
deep
dark
black
of
this
brew
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
powdered
cocoa
earth
hints
of
oatmeal
are
present
in
the
taste
melding
smoothly
with
chocolate
malts
hops
and
coffee
to
create
one
tasty
treat
its
thick
presence
belies
a
smooth
easy
drinking
finish
this
is
my
all
purpose
stout
drinkability
as
stouts
go
this
is
a
good
entrylevel
brew
for
what
darker
beers
should
be
it
has
earned
a
spot
in
my
regular
rotation
this
beer
went
from
a
disappointment
to
a
hell
of
an
enjoyable
stout
in
less
than
five
minutes
thanks
go
to
vintage
cellar
for
this
one
as
well
as
some
other
goodies
currently
stocked
in
my
cellar
fridge
a
tasty
and
friendly
stout
here
that
never
gets
harsh
body
is
a
little
light
but
that
is
just
perfect
for
drinking
at
lunchtime
when
you
dont
want
something
heavy
in
you
stomach
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
brown
opaque
no
light
through
at
all
also
pours
with
a
nice
head
that
diminishes
but
does
not
completely
disappear
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
there
could
be
a
hint
of
coffee
in
there
the
taste
has
a
slight
chocolate
feel
much
like
the
smell
and
a
slight
slight
bitterness
but
nothing
that
takes
away
from
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
with
light
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
next
time
i
head
to
the
beer
store
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
some
more
i
wont
turn
one
down
next
time
i
run
across
it
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
either
there
is
a
place
in
town
that
has
it
on
tap
perhaps
it
will
fare
better
served
that
way
this
is
a
really
smooth
and
pleasant
beer
its
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
stout
some
stouts
achieve
drinkability
by
scaling
back
on
mouthfeel
and
flavor
not
this
beer
although
it
is
not
as
complex
as
my
favorite
stouts
this
beer
is
thick
and
ferocious
enough
to
hold
its
own
in
the
category
the
sweetness
is
distinct
and
present
from
the
smell
to
the
aftertaste
and
everywhere
in
between
yet
the
sweetness
never
overwhelms
the
palate
or
becomes
cloying
i
drank
this
in
august
and
it
was
refreshing
im
guessing
that
in
january
itll
be
comforting
and
warming
flavors
are
similar
with
molasses
and
licorice
with
bitter
espresso
and
grapefruit
hops
to
dry
the
finish
alcohol
never
obvious
medium
to
full
body
and
a
round
solid
mouthfeel
from
the
oats
hints
of
chocolate
malts
a
good
stout
rich
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
for
having
the
sweetness
that
it
does
this
stout
finishes
fairly
dry
and
roasty
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
wish
it
was
readily
available
to
me
highly
recommended
excellent
drinking
stout
probably
the
best
with
around
6
3
abv
that
i
have
had
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
american
stout
i
would
like
to
drink
these
often
ingrediants
list
oats
so
i
consider
this
to
be
a
health
beverage
drinkability
very
nice
stout
hope
to
work
it
in
regularly
a
mouthful
indeed
and
very
tasty
for
those
that
like
a
stiffer
stout
with
very
little
to
no
sweetness
at
all
i
was
pleased
to
see
this
beer
available
at
corral
liquors
this
weekend
on
my
1st
trip
there
after
my
recent
move
back
to
st
louis
it
poured
into
the
shaker
pint
a
deep
inky
black
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
roast
malt
coffee
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
a
mild
citrus
back
the
flavor
reflected
the
aromas
extremely
well
the
coffee
morphed
into
more
of
an
espresso
character
and
the
cherry
chocolate
really
came
out
well
the
citrus
evolved
into
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
a
mild
alcohol
burning
there
on
the
finish
as
well
the
mouth
feel
had
the
richness
i
expect
in
a
good
stout
nice
beer
i
say
give
this
one
a
try
for
sure
its
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
tried
in
a
while
overall
a
good
stout
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
nothing
to
scoff
at
i
just
read
on
the
label
that
oatmeal
is
used
in
the
beer
which
would
explain
the
smoothness
a
good
stout
plain
and
simple
overall
impression
very
good
beer
massively
drinkable
sorry
my
review
doesnt
do
it
justice
creamy
well
balanced
stout
worth
the
hype
a
great
example
of
american
stout
drinkability
this
guy
has
too
much
hops
jumping
around
in
it
for
me
but
besides
that
it
drinks
pretty
well
i
probably
wont
try
it
again
but
i
would
definitely
suggest
it
to
other
people
that
like
the
bitterness
in
their
stouts
this
beer
is
ok
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
would
drink
another
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
pours
with
a
twofinger
brown
head
that
leaves
traces
of
lace
totally
opaque
black
color
heavy
bodied
and
light
carbonation
nose
is
coffeechocolate
starts
with
a
sweet
roasted
coffee
flavor
and
finishes
with
some
bitter
chocolate
overtones
the
brewer
says
that
the
abv
is
5
8
22oz
bottle
from
mark
in
california
dry
in
its
flavor
but
not
acidic
the
8
ball
delivers
a
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
stout
its
black
as
can
be
with
a
decentsized
head
of
deep
tan
that
fades
shortly
to
a
wide
collar
but
leaves
little
lace
the
nose
is
more
roasty
than
anything
else
think
spent
espresso
grounds
but
there
are
hints
of
caramel
there
as
well
surprisingly
its
quite
smooth
across
the
tongue
with
a
medium
and
somewhat
dextrinous
body
and
a
fine
restrained
carbonation
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
the
aroma
straightforward
its
not
complex
at
all
but
there
are
some
notes
of
yeasty
fruitiness
molasses
dark
cocoa
coffee
lowkey
citrusy
hops
and
alcohol
as
well
not
that
alcohol
has
flavor
but
its
presence
is
noticeable
the
bitterness
is
nicely
balanced
and
lends
towards
a
dry
finish
but
its
really
the
combination
of
bitterness
and
roastiness
that
gets
it
there
and
then
it
simply
disappears
from
the
palate
but
everything
in
life
is
a
tradeoff
and
here
we
pick
up
a
great
drinkability
in
the
deal
the
8
balls
is
a
smooth
drinkable
and
satisfying
stout
that
probably
deserves
more
credit
than
it
gets
because
it
doesnt
go
over
the
top
nicely
done
i
must
admit
that
this
is
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
stout
it
has
all
of
the
flavors
one
looks
for
in
a
nice
stout
plus
it
is
in
balance
and
it
is
ultimately
easy
on
the
palate
and
quite
the
quaffable
brew
ah
i
just
read
the
ingredients
on
the
bottle
it
is
the
oatmeal
that
gives
this
beer
that
full
yet
light
quality
the
oatmeal
really
works
quite
well
to
add
another
dimension
to
this
brew
my
second
florida
import
in
as
many
days
was
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
where
it
sat
dark
black
opaque
with
a
thin
brown
head
the
aroma
was
dark
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
burnt
grains
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
sweet
and
rich
flavors
of
cocoa
caramel
bitter
coffee
and
sour
apple
found
in
generous
dollops
oaty
oily
mouthfeel
with
some
lingering
burnt
toast
aftertaste
hop
bitterness
was
also
noticeable
towards
the
end
of
each
sip
as
easy
drinking
a
stout
as
any
ive
come
across
full
bodied
and
smooth
goes
good
with
roasted
meats
and
chili
its
just
the
thing
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
roasty
beer
deep
brown
not
100
opaque
creamy
brown
head
rocky
thinbubbled
rather
underwhelming
lactic
malt
aroma
typical
chococoffee
profile
is
complemented
by
a
vanilla
touch
that
gets
somehow
beany
it
gets
even
more
obvious
in
mouth
i
figure
on
some
days
i
would
call
it
vegetal
a
blend
of
the
almost
husky
malt
coffee
beans
and
the
greenish
hops
today
it
just
feels
beany
roasty
and
milky
sweet
finish
sticking
the
lips
together
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
medium
body
still
a
decent
drinking
beer
to
me
appearing
richer
than
it
really
is
but
how
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
in
the
whole
world
is
far
and
away
beyond
me
looking
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
of
the
lost
coast
brews
a
great
first
impression
when
prompted
to
think
about
my
style
preferences
by
the
occasional
forum
post
ive
always
put
stouts
in
fourth
or
fifth
position
ive
been
rethinking
that
lately
and
may
now
move
them
as
high
as
second
because
of
outstanding
beer
like
8
ball
stout
if
you
enjoy
the
style
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
give
this
one
a
try
pours
a
lovely
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
ruby
highlights
2
inchest
of
frothy
chestnut
colorlight
head
sits
on
top
then
dissipates
mostly
to
some
semblance
of
cling
to
the
glass
leaving
a
nice
edge
layer
some
roasted
malts
toasted
almonds
and
caramel
are
smelled
upon
sniffing
a
slight
cascade
hops
aroma
also
pierces
through
on
this
one
along
with
some
bits
of
chocolate
and
alcohol
presence
lots
of
smoke
flavor
with
the
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
chocolate
backing
them
up
also
the
cascade
hops
even
comes
through
a
slight
bit
leaving
a
bitter
finish
the
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
quickly
but
then
subsides
with
the
lighter
body
of
this
brew
the
alcohol
is
present
on
my
tongue
after
the
swallow
but
not
much
warming
with
this
one
a
bit
of
an
almond
aftertaste
quite
easy
to
consume
and
the
avb
would
sneak
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
i
believe
definitely
worth
trying
hat
brewery
but
this
has
some
lasting
power
great
session
beer
notes
the
chocolately
goodness
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
and
im
not
even
a
big
fan
of
chocolate
it
was
just
so
well
done
in
this
beer
that
i
have
to
tip
my
hat
to
it
this
is
the
first
brew
from
lost
coast
ive
had
the
honor
of
trying
but
if
this
one
is
any
indication
i
will
seek
out
some
of
the
others
cant
reccomend
this
stout
highly
enough
this
beer
pours
thick
and
dark
the
head
is
a
dark
tan
that
fades
to
laces
rather
quickly
it
smells
strongly
of
alcohol
it
smells
malty
aslo
it
smells
slightly
coffee
like
it
tastes
like
chocolate
and
rosted
malts
also
i
detect
a
toffee
this
beer
is
very
thick
but
well
balanced
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
great
i
would
like
to
drink
it
all
night
but
it
is
a
little
strong
everyone
should
definately
tru
this
one
it
is
always
available
so
you
can
enjoy
it
when
ever
you
want
i
finally
decided
to
give
this
a
try
after
reading
the
high
reviews
here
why
didnt
i
encorporate
this
heavenly
brew
into
my
rotation
long
ago
pours
like
used
motor
oil
into
the
glass
producing
a
thick
head
the
color
of
chocolate
milk
head
retention
is
good
with
thick
crusty
lacing
i
like
what
i
see
full
blown
aromas
of
expertly
toasted
dark
malts
english
toffee
chocolatecovered
raisens
and
bitter
coffee
a
sip
reveals
a
mildly
sweet
very
roasty
and
toasty
brew
brimming
with
chocolatey
goodness
dark
fruits
dipped
in
godiva
espresso
and
a
nice
nip
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
luxurious
almost
oily
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
generally
chewy
texture
theres
a
hint
of
sourness
that
i
like
to
find
in
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
an
excellent
stout
worthy
of
praise
when
poured
it
was
on
the
verge
of
being
black
with
very
dark
tan
foam
along
with
medium
lace
on
side
of
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
was
very
evident
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
along
with
the
chocolate
was
nicely
put
together
the
bitterness
was
well
balanced
along
with
just
a
slight
sourness
to
make
this
stout
pleasant
a
well
balance
stout
with
the
bittersour
feel
and
taste
on
the
palate
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
really
recommend
this
for
anybody
interested
in
seeing
what
a
stout
can
be
if
you
see
this
please
try
it
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
tall
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
roasted
malts
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
nice
and
malty
with
a
fruity
character
berries
and
finishes
with
a
coffee
bitterness
thick
mouthfeel
as
it
should
be
smooth
drinking
very
enjoyable
pours
like
a
good
stout
should
black
with
a
small
dark
brown
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
taste
is
roasty
up
front
with
hints
of
sweetness
towards
the
middle
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
balanced
taste
nothing
is
overpowering
isnt
too
bitter
or
sweet
kind
of
like
the
goldilocks
of
stouts
label
indicates
presence
of
oatmeal
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
among
other
ingredients
very
smooth
just
hearty
enough
not
too
filling
but
certainly
enough
to
notice
to
me
this
is
the
perfect
middle
of
the
road
stout
and
probably
my
favorite
nonimperialdouble
stout
recommended
drinkability

superb
great
beer
with
huge
roasted
and
charred
notes
could
drink
these
back
to
back
with
ease
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
finger
of
dark
tan
head
that
falls
to
thouroughly
coat
the
beer
this
beer
smells
great
there
is
a
ton
of
chocolate
with
a
coffee
background
that
gives
it
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
flavor
is
good
chocolate
on
the
start
that
moves
to
coffee
and
finishes
almost
like
burnt
coffee
with
a
huge
bitter
and
roasted
malts
damn
that
is
the
most
deep
roasted
flavor
i
can
remember
in
a
beer
the
feel
is
moderate
with
slight
creamy
tones
the
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
beer
as
well
i
like
the
aftertaste
a
lot
i
would
like
a
little
more
thickness
but
its
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
well
built
beer
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
one

is
sweetly
of

quickly
turns
to

me
thanks
for
my
son
for
telling
me
about
this
one
a
bit
overrated
as
creaminess

extra

or
complexity
would
help
a
full

that
defines

not

a
pleasant

great
for
a
cool
autumn
evening
another
solid
bre
from
lost
coast
definately
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
stout
fan
i
love
a
good
stout
this
ones
a
dense
obsidian
with
a
frothy
solid
tan
head
the
aroma
espressolike
intense
roasted
barley
burnt
and
toasted
malt
smells
its
certainly
deep
and
complex
but
the
smell
could
also
be
stronger
its
what
id
call
quiet
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
certainly
not
quiet
its
full
flavored
to
say
the
least
with
all
of
the
aromas
coming
out
chocolate
nuts
caramel
and
a
burnt
character
thick
and
solid
mouthfeel
the
brews
on
the
dry
side
of
life
overall
this
is
one
yummy
stout
wow
what
a
kick
ass
stout
this
8ball
pours
like
motor
oil
except
darker
small
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
smell
is
sweet
coffee
semi
sweet
chocolate
and
malt
taste
is
robust
bitter
with
a
very
subtle
sweetness
not
much
carbonation
but
not
missed
mouthfeel
is
sustantial
and
thick
a
real
belly
filler
drinkability
is
great
even
though
after
a
few
youll
feel
like
napping
like
after
thanksgiving
dinner
thanks
to
jahnoth
for
the
hookup
this
is
a
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
stout
that
i
will
assuredly
visit
with
regularity
in
the
famous
words

opaque

beer
rich
cocoa

aroma
is
just
a
pinch
smokey
on
the

side
for

stout
mainly
bitter
chocolate
flavor
with
a
bit
of
vegetably
note
the
flavor

a

hits
you
up

just
fades
all
the

through
to
the

rich
flavor
upfront
a

overall
possibly
smokey
i
like
stouts
so
it
works
for
me
but
it
may
not
be
for
all
nice
drinkability
for
a
stout
though
i
suspect
its
quite
strong
in
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
and
smooth
at
the
start
and
finish
the
coffee
and
chocolate
tones
last
long
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
heavy
bodied
brew
but
extremely
drinkable
as
the
tastebuds
are
very
happy
after
sipping
this
great
brew
this
came
in
a
22oz
bomber
with
an
8
ball
on
the
front
that
i
had
right
before
i
was
going
to
play
pool
maybe
it
would
help
my
game
this
pours
out
a
pitchblack
color
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
of
about
three
fingers
height
a
picture
perfect
stout
the
head
recedes
fairly
quickly
to
a
cap
of
bubbles
leaving
scattered
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
rise
from
the
glass
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
as
well
very
pleasing
smell
indeed
taste
is
heavy
with
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
jumping
out
with
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
playing
a
big
role
as
well
the
finish
is
dry
and
quite
bitter
with
a
lingering
coffee
flavor
and
slight
earthy
hoppiness
to
it
very
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
not
being
over
done
and
the
bitterness
being
very
present
medium
to
full
body
this
brew
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
makes
every
sip
enjoyable
a
surprisingly
good
stout
that
is
up
there
on
my
favorite
stouts
list
highly
recommend
the
beer
after
its
extraction
from
the
22ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
an
atramentous
color
with
a
planetary
sized
semicreamy
light
chocolate
head
and
after
its
dissolving
the
lace
forms
a
sticky
and
thick
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
rich
in
roasted
grain
chocolate
and
coffee
ah
that
smell
start
is
sweet
and
rich
in
malt
with
the
top
moderate
to
full
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
light
to
medium
in
acidity
the
hops
delectable
in
their
spicy
bite
desert
dry
aftertaste
and
a
decent
stout
overall
nice
nice
stout
one
that
i
will
be
buying
again
and
again
i
need
more
this
stuff
rocks
but
what
is
the
abv
pours
out
like
black
molasses
into
my
snifter
small
tannish
head
that
clings
to
life
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
roasty
lots
of
chocolate
overtones
with
roasted
coffee
beans
taste
is
heavily
smoky
with
the
coffee
bean
flavor
in
the
lead
just
a
hint
of
the
sweetness
but
the
malt
backbone
is
still
quite
present
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
especially
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeter
stout
very
solid
offering
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
dark
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
creamy
aroma
with
hints
of
patent
and
chocolate
malts
its
not
overpowering
but
it
is
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
rich
dark
malt
flavor
but
its
really
smooth
and
dry
it
goes
down
easily
and
finishes
with
a
mild
chocolate
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
stout
it
has
all
the
goods
a
good
sessions
brew
pours
a
beautiful
black
with
a
small
chocolate
head
that
dissapates
quickly
lacing
throughout
glass
smells
like
burnt
coffee
and
chocolate
has
a
sweet
chocolate
taste
reminds
me
of
left
hand
milk
stout
while
not
as
sweet
has
a
somewhat
bitter
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
a
very
drinkable
stout
really
like
this
one
pours
midnight
black
with
a
twofinger
creamy
head
thats
probably
the
darkest
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
somewhere
between
mudbrown
and
dark
coffee
deep
earthy
nose
holds
notes
of
coffee
molasses
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
smokiness
beautiful
creamy
mouthfeel
is
absoultely
wonderful
like
good
chocolate
milk
palate
is
chocolate
malt
and
coffee
up
front
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
kicking
up
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
dont
know
why
i
havent
had
this
stout
before
its
a
good
one
this
went
down
velvety
smooth
i
could
drink
several
of
these
this
was
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
lost
coast
but
it
wont
be
the
last
i
didnt
notice
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
it
sure
did
warm
the
belly
excellent
drinkability
nonetheless
and
ive
found
a
new
favorite
stout
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
this

a
smooth
rich
beer

really
appetizing
creamy

well
with
notes
of

in
your
face
a
delicious
stout
that
deserves
more
recognition

winner
from
lost
coast
quite
nice
a
good

it
would
be
great
to
see
around
here

a
nice
sweet
and
smoky
character
that
melds
quite
well
hopefully
this
will
be
one
that
i
can
have
again
slithers
out
of
the
bottle
an
opaque
black
with
a
shortlived
cocao
head
that
leaves
some
rings
of
wavy
lacing
smell
is
chocolate
liquer
with
some
roast
chicory
and
mild
hop
notes
the
taste
is
initially
pungently
bitter
and
continues
to
become
sweeter
and
oatier
until
a
creamy
citric
smoothness
takes
over
oiliness
lingers
reminds
one
of
good
coffee
mouthfeel
is
fabulous
if
a
little
thin
for
the
style
in
some
peoples
books
drinkability
is
slow
and
deep
and
dark
and
goood
ill
have
another
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
in
a
mixed
sixer
i
picked
up
in
blacksburg
va
vintage
cellar
robust
and
bold
stout
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
i
have
heard
good
things
about
it
anywho
pours
a
syrupy
looking
jet
black
with
a
pretty
dark
tan
head
that
settles
out
quickly
the
aroma
was
very
roasty
and
breadlike
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
pleasant
the
taste
is
strong
and
complex
very
strong
maltiniess
at
first
and
a
finish
with
the
standard
trio
of
carmelchocolatecoffee
notes
i
was
impressed
with
the
feel
of
aftertaste
as
i
found
it
to
be
velvety
smooth
and
buttery
very
nice
the
syrupy
texture
is
surprisingly
light
on
the
tongue
enough
so
that
i
found
it
to
be
slightly
lacking
in
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
overall
i
was
pleased
i
wouldnt
write
home
about
it
but
i
would
buy
it
again
sometime
full
body
very
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
very
strong
roasted
flavors
that
move
to
bitter
chocolate
coffee
flavors
are
dispersed
the
whole
way
through
roasted
finish
with
a
moderate
sweetbitter
aftertaste
a
nice
stout
something
to
drink
again
theres
nothing
really
notable
about
the
mouthfeel
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
overall
i
had
to
give
this
a
3
0
for
drinkability
i
treat
drinkability
as
a
general
will
i
buy
this
again
ranking
because
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
but
the
cost
for
what
you
get
if
you
like
bitter
and
the
deep
coffee
flavors
this
is
the
beer
for
you
ill
buy
it
again
but
itll
be
a
while
thanks
for
gem
of
a
stout
murph
completely
opaque
black
pour
topped
with
tight
foamy
head
the
color
of
brown
sugar
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
at
all
though
and
lacing
is
minimal
smell
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
traditional
roasted
cocoa
and
coffeelike
notes
that
are
lightened
by
a
hoppy
twang
that
twang
carries
over
to
the
taste
which
is
lighter
than
a
typical
stout
roasted
flavors
are
muted
but
form
a
nice
foundation
mouthfeel
similarly
is
lighter
than
expected
though
this
makes
for
a
stout
that
goes
down
easier
than
most
one
of
my
favorites
from
lost
coast
22oz
bomber
bottle
this
stuff
is
like
a
micro
version
of
guinness
an
opaque
black
body
with
a
large
brown
head
of
foam
that
lasts
and
lasts
aromas
are
straight
forward
and
consist
of
roasted
malts
slightly
acidic
hops
chocolate
and
more
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
hops
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
some
caramel
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
right
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
excellent
as
well
a
good
stout
pours
a
dark
and
rich
midnight
black
color
dark
and
creamy
coffee
brown
colored
head
the
aroma
is
rich
and
syrupy
sweet
with
fruit
licorice
charcoal
and
kaluha
liqueur
theres
a
sweet
and
roasted
nutlike
presence
in
this
beer
the
roasted
grains
taste
like
they
are
overdone
here

tastes
a
bit
burnt
with
a
harsh
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
hard
to
drink
its
too
over
the
top
without
any
real
mellow
smoothness
its
strong
rich
and
bold
some
others
would
probably
like
it
a
bit
more
than
me
pours
jet
black
with
a
thinnish
dark
dark
tan
head
lovely
imperial
stout
aroma
rich
chocolatey
malt
sweet
cherry
and
an
underlying
alcohol
scent
the
taste
is
huge
very
chocolatey
with
heaps
of
oatmeal
a
bit
of
prune
kicks
in
at
the
finish
yielding
to
a
lovely
roasty
aftertaste
not
a
lot
of
hops
to
the
finish
here
but
not
at
all
cloying
still
the
hops
might
help
to
soften
the
alcohol
flavor
which
as
it
stands
becomes
just
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
taste
at
the
finish
still
damn
drinkable
and
quite
a
surprise
for
me
id
not
heard
much
about
this
brewery
but
will
be
sure
to
look
into
them
more
thoroughly
this
stout
is
black
no
light
getting
through
it
poured
nice
and
seemed
to
be
a
thicker
brew
a
big
frothy
brown
head
formed
quickly
but
faded
back
to
thin
layer
over
the
top
of
the
glass
it
smells
a
bit
sweet
with
a
malt
nose
the
first
taste
was
good
not
overly
memorable
but
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
flavor
to
it
with
some
chocolate
notes
it
is
a
bit
thicker
than
the
stouts
ive
had
recently
which
is
a
good
thing
a
very
good
thing
the
after
taste
is
a
little
bland
but
makes
you
want
another
sip
overall
a
nice
stout
for
party
and
definetly
worth
the
money
definately
pick
this
one
up
i
crack
the
top
carefully
i
always
use
a
quarter
wrapped
in
a
scrap
of
paper
towel
so
i
dont
scratch
the
painted
surface
i
rinse
the
cap
and
shake
off
the
excess
water
but
just
before
i
toss
it
into
the
plastic
tub
with
the
others
i
take
a
sniff
it
still
gives
out
that
bitter
mocha
coffee
aroma
my
eyes
twinkle
with
the
anticipation
the
beer
pours
black
and
oily
it
eerily
makes
no
sound
and
kicks
up
a
chocolate
cream
that
laces
the
sides
of
the
glass
perfectly
the
aroma
is
rich
with
milk
chocolate
and
charcoal
the
hops
are
reserved
in
this
one
but
theyre
there
lurking
giving
the
burned
barley
bitterness
a
little
support
its
almost
like
drinking
chocolate
milk
this
one
its
body
thick
and
smooth
with
the
huge
cocoa
flavor
lingering
a
touch
longer
than
the
rest
highly
recommended
12

a
touch
of

very
thick

alcohol

the

dry

clean
a
very
good
stout
here
this
beer
just
hit
me
all
wrong
im
a
great
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
but
this
had
a
smokey
character
that
was
disquieting
great
coal
black
color
some
dark
roasted
coffee
in
the
aroma
but
a
hickory
smoke
aspect
to
the
malt
that
also
had
an
odd
acidity
like
smoked
summer
sausage
blah
thanks
to
bierreise
for
this
fine
stout
jet
black
color
with
a
medium
thick
dark
brown
head
thin
and
very
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
strong
roasted
malt
and
coffee
character
rich
body
and
rather
smooth
with
a
nice
blend
of
coffee
malt
molasses
and
chocolate
flavors
the
finish
is
moderately
bitter
coffee
with
a
pinch
of
hops
this
is
a
solid
stout
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
strong
alcohol
give
this
stout
a
some
bite
nothing
to
worry
about
it
is
just
part
of
the
enjoyment
of
the
stout
this
stout
would
go
well
with
a
robust
cigar
this
is
an
excellent
stout
typical
dark
black
appearance
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
good
full
body
some
chocolate
and
expresso
flavors
noted
but
relatively
subtle
very
good
balance
and
drinkability
i
would
rate
it
just
below
shakespeare
but
above
sierra
nevada
very
nice
thanks
for
the
sample
ron
comments

this
was
a
nice
surprise
that
i
found
in
a
care
package
from
mickeymac
kudos
to
my
ba
bro
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
8
ball
stout
it
had
a
lush
feel
and
fine
balance
which
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
im
developing
an
affinity
for
stouts
and
this
one
is
ranking
quite
highly
on
my
best
stout
list
this
beer
pours
like
black
ink
the
head
is
very
dark
brown
and
rocky
as
it
dies
back
it
laces
the
glass
the
aroma
is
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
roasted
then
chocolate
that
lasts
into
a
dry
chocolate
finish
the
body
is
very
well
done
and
the
drinkability
due
to
the
myriad
of
flavors
is
good
holy
cow
was
this
an
unusual
site
to
be
seen
this
beer
poured
darker
than
any
i
have
seen
and
the
head
was
so
incredibly
brown
i
thought
i
was
looking
at
a
rich
chocolate
mousse
the
fragrance
has
a
really
nice
roasty
scent
to
it
that
should
be
savoured
this
is
one
for
anyone
who
truly
appreciates
a
nice
dark
rich
brew
while
there
is
no
coffee
to
be
found
in
here
it
could
be
compared
to
a
nice
dark
roast
cup
of
coffee
like
the
ones
i
have
had
in
the
yukon
in
canada
as
opposed
to
your
typical
u
s
mass
market
brewed
coffee
the
head
lingered
for
quite
some
time
as
did
the
roastiness
of
the
flavor
find
this
and
enjoy
i
brought
back
a
bomber
of
the
8
ball
on
our
recent
trip
to
the
west
coast
and
sampled
it
last
night
here
in
ct
just
as
the
first
prewinter
chill
was
starting
to
creep
in
the
8
ball
pours
out
black
as
its
namesake
dark
as
a
mooness
night
topped
with
a
nice
mahogany
head
smells
abundantly
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
malt
none
of
the
tangy
sweetness
or
hints
of
alcohol
that
you
often
find
in
some
other
big
stouts
taste
is
very
full
and
roasty
like
my
favorite
black
coffee
with
just
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
hinting
of
hops
and
bringing
it
to
a
nice
crisp
finish
leaves
a
nice
smoky
aftertaste
thats
quite
pleasant
and
leaves
you
lookign
forward
to
the
next
sip
pours
pitch
black
with
a
persistent
chestnut
colored
head
not
a
single
ray
of
light
passes
through
this
baby
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
malt
coffee
and
a
light
note
of
pine
flavor
begins
sweet
with
chocolate
and
molasses
then
becomes
bitter
with
coffee
and
some
piney
hops
well
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
full
bodied
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
stout
worth
seeking
out
dark

sweet
but
also
not
very
bitter
mouthfeel

full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste

slightly
sweet
with
a
slight

very
drinkable
stout
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
rich
tan
head
that
fades
away
quickly
that
leaves
a
thin
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
there
are
some
roasted
malt
aromas
that
are
very
apparent
with
slightly
sweet
undertones
the
taste
is
like
that
of
a
strong
coffee
mixed
with
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
comes
through
at
the
end
of
each
drink
the
body
is
medium
and
well
balanced
this
isnt
the
greatest
stout
that
ive
had
but
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable

that
i
would
happily
recommend
to
anyone
thanks
to

for
the
sample
glub

with
big
flavors
of
chocolate
burnt

smoke
espresso
is
that
hints
of
oatmeal
as
well
very
creamy
and
smooth
this
tastes
like
a
hybrid
stout
as
if
somebody
said
what
if
we
put
a
chocolate
imperial
and
oatmeal
stout
together
what
would
that
taste
like
well
i
imagine
it
would
taste
just
like
this
truly
wonderful
but
i
am
a
stout
lover
so
i
may
be
a
little
biased
but
no
i
dont
think
so
two
pints
up
thanks
bierriese
stouts
are
not
for
everyone
but
i
find
myself
partial
to
them
oatmeal
stouts
in
particular
snuggled
ever
so
warmly
halfway
between
a
youngs
double
chocolate
and
a
rogue
shakespeare
the
8
ball
stout
succeeds
in
achieving
that
ever
so
rare
and
exquisite
balance
of
roasted
hop
bitterness
with
sweet
oatmeal
and
chocolate
maltiness
that
makes
for
a
truly
unique
and
enjoyable
treat
a
bit
intense
with
the
first
few
sips
but
an
equillibrium
is
quickly
achieved
making
for
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
on
the
planet
are
you
a
guiness
nut
and
ready
for
something
that
will
make
you
rethink
your
position
in
the
universe
the
8
ball
stout
from
the
lost
coast
brewery
is
the
key
so
i
saw
good
reviews
for
this
and
i
bought
a
sixer
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
decent
little
brown
head
smells
like
coffee
chocolate
burnt
malt
tastes
like
coffee
with
a
hint
of
burnt
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
with
just
a
little
bitter
kick
mouth
feel
is
nice
slighty
creamy
but
not
too
heavy
drinkability
is
good
because
this
is
a
solid
good
stout
and
who
cant
keep
in
downing
a
tastey
stout
would
be
a
good
desert
beer
good
for
relaxing
and
sipping

an

updated

this
is
a
really
nice
stout
lost
coasts
best
brew
in
my
opinion
it
must
be
that
hint
of
oatmeal
that
gives
it
a
fullness
and
little
sour
tang
which
i
really
like
pours
a
super
black

that

thrown
in

dark
chocolate
flavors
start
off
with
some
hints
of
raisnins
and
other
dark

the
smooth

flavor
slowly
fades
into
a
nice
bitter
coffee
flavor
which
then
fades
into
a
nice
lingering
bitter
roastedburnt
finish
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
brew
is
definitely
very
drinkable
a
very
good
brew
all
around
ov
one
of
the
better
coffee
offerings
ive
had
a
toned
down
southern
tier
jahva
the
oats
are
really
a
great
addition
very
enjoyable
very
dark
pour
with
no
visibility
a
nice
1
finger
head
leaves
some
lacing
smells
is
so
rich
with
coffee
very
pleasant
smelling
some
grains
are
also
noted
taste
is
again
full
of
coffee
i
loved
this
taste
not
much
else
really
going
on
subtle
notes
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
full
and
well
carbonated
overall
i
loved
this
so
much
coffee
amazing
o
just
when
i
think
the
floyds
only
know
how
to
rock
out
with
their
hop
out
they
remind
me
that
im
an
idiot
by
making
something
like
this
or
the
mushy
p
hbi
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
better
id
say
top
5
oatmeal
stouts
ive
ever
had
its
my
favorite
style
so
im
pretty
critical
when
it
comes
to
oat
stouts
huge
oat
flavors
dominate
this
beer
i
wish
i
picked
more
coffee
but
then
again
this
beer
was
fantastic
as
is
please
bottle
this
beer
already
o
an
awesome
coffee
beer
fff
intelligentsia
is
definitely
a
winning
combination
overall
this
beer
had
me
smiling
the
whole
time
i
was
drinking
it
it
has
a
place
in
my
top
10
beer
list
now
i
hope
that
floyds
ends
up
bottling
and
distributing
this
soon
because
it
is
hands
down
one
of
their
better
beers
and
thats
saying
a
lot
if
you
can
get
to
the
pub
if
you
like
coffee
or
are
in
the
mood
to
try
something
different
and
new
you
have
to
get
this
beer
pours
black
in
color
without
much
of
a
head
nose
is
loaded
with
fresh
coffee
aromas
with
some
chocolate
notes
taste
is
pretty
much
coffee
from
the
start
to
finish
tons
of
fresh
coffee
mixed
in
with
chocolates
somewhat
onedimensional
but
pretty
delicious
altogether
mouth
has
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
through
the
middle
and
smoothes
it
out
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
coffee
beer
but
a
good
drinking
beer
pretty
damn
flavorful
for
a
regular
oatmeal
stout
tons
of
coffee
roasted
malt
stouty
goodness
caramel
other
deliciousness
could
use
more
body
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
thats
peanuts
this
is
an
incredible
beer
that
i
wish
they
bottled
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
do
like
my
coffee
stouts
a
little
less
coffee
forward
but
this
well
made
in
the
fff
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
wouldnt
say
that
it
was
great
but
certainly
worthy
of
a
try
the
low
abv
makes
for
a
more
sessionable
stout
it
would
have
been
more
enjoyable
if
the
flavors
that
already
exist
were
just
more
powerful
d
effortless
to
drink
this
one
and
helps
remedy
my
hatred
for
chicago
traffic
at
2
p
m
on
a
sunday
revisiting
would
be
a
nobrainer
though
it
doesnt
seem
quite
as
robust
in
the
coffee
notes
as
i
recall
pairs
really
well
with
loud
music
and
a
desire
to
be
left
alone
for
some
pensive
beer
snob
moments
pours
darkest
brown
possible
with
about
a
one
finger
head
not
easy
to
judge
with
plastic
cups
strong
espresso
with
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
accents
on
the
nose
just
like
the
aroma
bold
espresso
floods
the
tastebuds
is
quickly
met
by
slightly
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
finishes
balanced
with
just
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
wonderful
mouthfeel
on
this
brew
medium
body
appropriate
for
an
oatmeal
stout
adequate
carbonation
lends
to
a
creamy
and
satisfying
beer
overall
an
excellent
brew
o
another
good
offering
from
fff
this
has
a
great
nose
and
looks
great
but
the
mouthfeel
and
lighter
flavors
really
lets
this
one
down
and
prevents
it
from
being
a
great
beer
overall
outstanding
coffee
beer
that
was
totally
worth
it
t
some
great
freshly
ground
coffee
and
tootsie
roll
flavor
with
dark
chocolate
and
raisin
undertones
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
usually
dont
like
thinner
stouts
but
this
one
was
amazing
had
this
on
tap
at
pizza
port
carlsbad
when
i
was
there
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
mochacolored
head
scent
was
out
of
this
world
with
freshbrewed
coffee
and
molasses
a
bit
of
charcoal
as
well
taste
was
like
starbucks
bitch
slapped
you
in
the
face
tons
of
fresh
coffee
with
some
roasted
malt
and
vanilla
flavors
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
with
slightly
bitter
finish
drinkability
was
very
high
overall
if
you
love
coffee
you
will
love
this
beer
i
had
funky
buddhas
maple
bacon
coffee
porter
a
few
nights
ago
and
to
me
these
two
beers
have
the
best
coffee
profile
may
need
to
revisit
speedway
stout
since
its
been
a
while
my
main
point
is
that
its
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
a
nearperfect
coffee
stout
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
three
floyds
this
stuff
is
fantastic
overall
a
very
good
coffee
stout
o
a
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
from
fff
excellent
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
combined
with
a
low
abv
make
this
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
recommended
nice
black
color
with
a
small
ring
of
tiny
bubbles
its
pretty
thin
but
does
leave
some
slightly
syrupy
traces
around
the
glass
as
you
swirl
aroma
is
a
massive
wave
of
dark
roast
coffee
with
the
flavor
following
almost
identically
except
there
are
a
few
slight
notes
of
chocolate
with
the
coffee
flavors
as
i
mentioned
it
is
on
the
lighter
bodied
side
of
things
but
also
very
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
really
is
remarkable
how
much
it
tastes
like
pure
iced
coffee
truly
a
fantastic
beer
if
youre
into
these
sorts
of
flavors
cannot
wait
until
i
get
to
try
it
again
and
here
i
thought
coffee
bender
was
going
to
be
the
closest
beer
to
an
iced
coffee
id
ever
try
overall
this
is
something
i
could
easily
drink
on
a
regular
basis
and
something
i
can
recommend
without
hesitation
to
anyone
who
likes
medium
stouts
though
this
tastes
and
feels
like
a
bigger
one
and
drinks
like
a
smaller
one
got
this
beer
at
the
three
floyds
event
at
the
uchicago
pub
really
great
event
it
pours
the
blackest
of
blacks
but
there
is
absolutely
no
head
on
this
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
especially
from
an
oatmeal
stout
in
terms
of
head
aroma
is
outstanding
great
coffee
mocha
aromas
dominate
and
every
once
in
a
while
a
bit
of
citrus
hoppiness
pops
up
and
says
hello
the
flavor
is
a
great
reflection
with
overwhelming
coffee
and
coco
and
roasted
malts
and
again
when
you
least
expect
it
that
american
citrus
hop
character
makes
its
self
known
moutfeel
was
creamy
light
and
well
carbonated
i
never
expected
i
would
have
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
but
i
was
really
happy
i
did
it
was
definitely
the
highlight
of
the
night
overall
a
very
very
pleasant
surprise
and
one
to
be
savored
if
you
can
find
it
id
wanted
to
try
a
dark
beer
not
robert
the
bruce
from
3
floyds
for
some
time
since
most
of
what
we
get
here
is
gumballhead
and
pride
and
joy
lived
up
to
anything
i
could
have
expected
from
it
theres
not
much
wrong
with
this
one
not
having
any
opportunity
to
get
out
to
fff
im
very
glad
to
have
gotten
a
shot
at
this
beer
d
sip
it
like
coffee
thats
all
i
have
to
say
drinkabilitythis
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
im
a
big
fan
of
coffee
this
is
a
great
mild
coffee
stout
but
with
none
of
the
sourness
you
sometimes
get
with
this
style
d
wow
oh
wow
if
you
like
coffee
you
will
like
this
beer
the
abv
is
very
low
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
to
this
beer
i
could
have
sat
down
and
had
many
many
pints
of
this
beer
fff
just
proves
once
again
that
they
are
not
just
another
brewery
their
flavorful
beers
are
worthy
of
most
of
the
hype
they
get
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
signatured
by
the
silky
finish
but
with
bold
coffee
character
though
high
in
quality
you
should
expect
a
very
coffeeforward
beer
drinkablilty
this
is
crazy
good
i
really
wish
they
decided
to
bottle
this
beer
for
2011
it
could
be
such
a
great
gateway
beer
for
people
who
think
they
dont
like
darker
beers
poured
from
a
growler
acquired
in
a
trade
from
cheezedawg
pours
thick
black
with
ample
tan
head
smells
of
subtile
coffee
and
heavy
chocolate
tastes
the
same
and
very
smooth
mellow
drink
with
ample
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
high
my
bmc
drinking
friend
even
liked
it
and
we
killed
the
growler
quickly
i
will
turn
him
to
the
darkside
yet
d
its
good
but
ill
take
a
beer
geek
brunch
weasel
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
and
three
times
on
sunday
good
not
great
pours
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
head
retention
is
really
good
as
is
lacing
the
smell
is
unsurprisingly
dominated
by
cold
brewed
dark
roast
coffee
and
lighter
notes
of
toasty
malt
and
dark
chocolate
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
delicious
intellegensia
coffee
taking
center
stage
the
bitterness
from
the
coffee
is
noticeably
absent
with
only
a
beautifully
smooth
roasted
bean
flavor
remaining
the
toasty
malt
and
dark
chocolate
notes
provide
nice
depth
along
with
some
light
dark
fruit
flavors
that
creep
in
on
the
finish
this
is
a
whole
lot
more
complex
than
many
coffee
stouts
the
fullbody
is
presumably
assisted
by
the
oatmeal
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
but
not
overly
so
and
the
alcohol
is
almost
nonexistant
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
due
to
the
complex
flavors
and
absence
of
intrusive
bitterness
and
alcohol
pretty
much
unquestionably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
tried
and
right
there
with
the
best
coffee
stouts
ive
had
as
this
was
my
first
beer
of
2011
i
think
it
bodes
well
for
the
year
d
definitely
tasty
no
booziness
to
it
as
i
mentioned
it
goes
down
smooth
d
alas
ive
got
a
sunday
to
myself
full
of
playoff
football
and
a
kickass
stout
please
contain
your
tears
i
know
its
a
sob
story
totally
going
to
kill
this
growler
on
my
own
d
o
ya
i
would
drink
this
again
fff
strikes
yet
again
with
another
terrific
beer
beer
is
creamy
and
finishes
with
some
coffee
notes
on
the
ending
its
medium
bodied
and
has
a
great
forward
mild
sweetness
good
body
in
the
middle
low
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
a
strongly
bitter
but
not
overpowering
finish
id
have
more
of
this
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
mikesgroove
for
sharing
this
one
with
myself
zack
cameron
scott
and
rich
at
gbx
served
from
growler
into
a
north
coast
old
rasputin
nonic
poured
pitch
black
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
cream
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
just
plain
excellent
very
nice
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
in
this
one
flavor
came
on
in
waves
which
made
my
palate
very
happy
glad
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
try
this
one
without
doubt
thanks
again
for
sharing
this
gem
mike
overall
a
superb
offering
here
one
one
the
best
i
have
ever
had
in
the
style
by
far
simply
an
amazing
beer
for
the
love
of
god
three
floyds
can
you
please
bottle
some
of
your
masterpieces
so
they
can
be
traded
for
by
us
out
of
towners
bottle
this
please
pours
black
with
a
slight
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
plus
a
fairlywide
collar
as
the
head
falls
down
the
nose
is
really
strong
black
coffee
plus
a
bit
of
roast
really
really
strong
coffee
not
too
much
else
there
but
the
coffee
is
really
nice
and
doesnt
need
anything
else
to
back
it
up
the
taste
is
quite
similarroasted
malt
is
certainly
there
as
well
as
some
strong
black
highquality
coffee
really
enjoying
this
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
it
though
the
coffee
comes
through
with
a
nice
bitter
roasted
feel
good
carbonation
levels
and
goes
down
quite
easilyhad
quite
a
bit
of
this
without
thinking
about
it
huge
fan
of
this
though
it
doesnt
quite
compare
to
the
bullfrog
double
coffee
which
is
the
brew
i
hold
every
coffeeinfused
beer
up
against
still
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
thanks
again
alex
wow
its
like
drinking
coffee
only
better
delicious
creamy
alcoholic
effervescent
malty
coffee
its
incredibly
smooth
and
manages
to
pack
a
huge
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
without
any
bitterness
at
all
its
medium
bodies
with
a
clean
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
i
drink
lots
and
lots
of
black
coffee
this
beer
is
more
or
less
just
coffee
it
smells
like
coffee
and
tastes
like
it
but
goes
down
even
smoother
no
need
to
get
into
the
details
except
that
it
is
jet
black
lightly
carbonated
and
incredibly
drinkable
really
wish
they
would
bottle
this
and
send
it
to
ohio
drinkability
is
exceptional
this
is
most
likely
the
best
coffee
stout
i
have
ever
had
and
i
think
most
of
the
tasting
group
i
was
with
would
agree
great
noseflavor
and
only
6
abv
this
would
give
most
imperial
coffee
beers
a
run
for
their
money
and
the
coffee
aspect
is
actually
better
than
any
other
imperial
sized
beers
ive
had
with
coffee
way
to
go
three
floyds
i
highly
recommend
seeking
this
out
before
its
gone
d
im
really
glad
i
had
someone
to
split
the
growler
with
the
coffee
flavor
is
just
to
intense
for
me
to
want
a
lot
of
this
overall
a
onedimensional
beer
as
far
as
looks
go
this
beer
doesnt
look
much
different
than
any
other
coffee
stout
dark
brownblack
with
a
tiny
head
that
quickly
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
and
no
head
retention
in
terms
of
smell
it
is
pure
coffee
with
a
tiny
hint
of
fig
and
burnt
roasts
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
clearly
dominated
by
by
the
coffee
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
other
than
the
coffee
conclusion
if
you
like
iced
coffee
that
is
very
rhich
in
flavor
you
will
love
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
just
be
careful
you
might
not
realize
how
much
you
drink
and
end
up
completely
drunk
d
a
nice
beer
that
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
above
average
definitely
but
if
you
add
to
the
fact
that
its
difficult
to
acquire
in
this
area
id
say
there
are
better
beers
to
be
had
at
fff
tastes
great
but
a
slightly
thin
body
prevents
everything
from
tying
together
perfectly
its
straightforward
and
delicious
black
coffee
up
front
dry
american
hops
in
the
back
big
huge
bitterness
all
throughout
if
you
can
stop
by
fff
you
must
try
this
one
before
its
gone
this
beer
is
right
there
with
the
founders
breakfast
stout
as
the
best
coffee
beers
available
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
not
complex
in
terms
of
of
flavors
but
the
coffee
notes
are
second
to
none
i
am
jealous
of
you
who
live
close
to
3fs
right
about
now
d
overall
i
could
drink
this
all
day
with
the
sessionable
abv
and
super
smooth
flavors
this
one
hits
the
spot
for
sure
one
of
the
best
coffee
forward
oatmeal
stouts
ive
ever
had
drinkability
i
could
sip
this
stuff
all
day
the
abv
isnt
out
of
control
like
a
lot
of
the
other
stouts
it
was
a
pleasure
to
experience
honestly
i
would
drink
this
in
the
morning
before
i
would
drink
beer
geek
breakfast
this
is
a
coffee
stout
that
takes
coffee
seriously
she
was
intrigued
enough
to
ask
where
the
brewery
was
so
she
could
get
more
i
think
when
we
make
it
to
chicago
at
some
point
well
make
a
detour
and
here
i
thought
coffee
bender
was
going
to
be
the
closest
beer
to
an
iced
coffee
id
ever
try
growler
shared
by

at

tasting
thanks
pours
a
opaque
hazy
coffee
brownblack
with
a
small
mocha
head
that
disappears
fast
smell
is
pure
espresso
with
a
slightly
sweet
milk
and
chocolate
malt
in
the
background
big
coffee
flavors
up
front
slightly
sweet
with
lots
of
coffee
grounds
following
and
some
bitterness
somehow
it
is
not
overpowering
for
a
coffee
stout
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
mild
carbonation
coating
and
creamy
this
is
one
tasty
coffee
stout
hopefully
they
will
decide
to
make
it
again
as
a
fan
boy
of
intelligentsia
coffee
i
was
eager
to
try
this
did
not
let
down
awesome
coffee
bomb
growler
provided
by
chris
a
few
days
old
so
im
not
going
to
comment
on
the
carbonation
but
its
a
nice
light
black
beer
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
really
good
and
immediately
you
can
pull
on
the
intelligenstia
coffee
and
the
notes
and
remind
me
of
bcs
coffee
roasted
coffee
creamy
a
little
vanilla
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
flavors
but
its
exceedily
good
and
so
damn
smooth
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
i
need
to
go
out
and
try
fresh
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
d
highly
drinkable
for
something
with
such
strong
coffee
i
drank
several
glasses
of
this
and
loved
it
phenomenal
beer
d
nice
that
there
is
so
much
flavor
in

klaus
drinkability
the
floyd
clan
really
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
coffee
oatmeal
stout
it
leans
hard
on
the
coffee
to
accentuate
the
malt
roastiness
moreover
less
malt
sweetness
than
in
the
usual
oatmeal
coffee
stout
robust
very
well
balanced
dare
i
say
tempered
not
too
much
acrid
roastcoffee
grounds
bitterness
one
of
the
better
coffeecentric
beers
ive
ever
had
d
this
is
very
drinkable
for
a
coffee
beer
it
isnt
overly
bitter
or
palate
destroying
like
some
of
its
brethren
and
theres
no
alcohol
to
be
found
onedimensional
but
who
cares
this
thing
is
incredible
i
could
sip
this
all
day
fantastic
though
i
am
not
typically
a
fan
of
stouts
this
one
was
solid
not
as
thick
as
i
expected
which
was
refreshing
happy
i
tried
it
but
it
didnt
change
my
mind
about
stouts
session
stout
would
love
to
see
it
on
nitro
tap
very
solid
outmeal
stout
it
has
a
gumball
head
taste
to
it
with
a
nutty
hint
to
it
it
kind
of
has
like
a
creamy
pine
flavour
to
it
its
hard
to
describe
its
very
unique
and
is
something
you
should
pick
up
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
from
the
look
and
smell
which
were
excellent
i
expected
a
stronger
fuller
flavor
from
this
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
didnt
get
the
thickness
or
body
i
expected
from
an
oatmeal
stout
especially
one
from
fff
it
is
creamy
a
different
stout
a
little
stout
notes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
but
creamy
and
smooth
i
like
this
one
very
much
a
reallyl
stout
oatmeal
stout
hoppy
at
first
but
give
it
a
few
mins
and
its
perfect
havent
been
too
impressed
with
3
floyds
offerings
but
this
was
solid
anyway
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
very
unique
and
it
fits
with
three
floyds
style
of
making
unique
beers
im
not
a
fan
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
taste
of
grapes
in
this
stout
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
to
me
its
a
pretty
strange
oatmeal
stout
weird
fruit
notes
that
i
really
enjoy
just
cant
pin
them
down
unlike
anything
ive
had
from
3fs
amazing
complex
flavor
nutty
vanilla
sweet
but
bitter
at
the
same
time
unbelievable
this
was
definitely
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
tried
my
wife
didnt
mind
it
and
is
slightly

delicious

when
held
to
a

in

i
like
that
you
can

through
it
no

a
plus
been
drinking
this
beer
for
long
time
i
stack
all
oatty
stouts
against
this
one
its
my
favorite
excellent
job
by
the
brewers
overall
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
great
stout
cant
wait
to
buy
more
this
one
just
did
not
work
for
me
id
like
to
say
there
is
a
smokiness
but
it
is
more
ashy
to
me
i
like
that
it
is
dry
but
there
is
very
little
of
interest
in
the
flavor
nice
oatmeal
stout
zero

great
tasting
stout
not
much
on

my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
its
so
quaffable
very
wellbalanced
beer
overall
pours
black
with
a
minimal
brown
head
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
and
light
roast
taste
follows
with
dark
fruit
and
roast
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
my
favorite
stoutoatmeal
stout
but
not
bad
i
especially
love
the
label
art
it
fits
the
flavor
of
the
beer
perfectly
it
makes
me
want
to
sit
outside
on
a
summer
night
under
a
full
moon
and
sip
on
a
few
of
these
staring
at
the
moon
and
contemplating
my
place
in
the
cosmos
its
my
favorite
beer
i
have
ever
had
there
just
quite
isnt
a
oatmeal
stout
like
it
o
o
i
like
this
will
revisit
o
an
incredible
fullflavoured
easydrinking
stout
with
a
very
strong
roast
character
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
really
enjoy
the
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
from
bottle
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
a
pleasant
surprise
this
oatmeal
stout
was
preceded
by
a
founders
breakfast
helds
its
own
the
aroma
was
a
bit
more
funky
compared
to
the
from
the
tap
founders
but
that
is
to
be
expected
bottom
line
this
is
a
damn
good
stout
ive
had
better
stouts
this
one
smells
better
than
it
tastes
and
feels
kind
of
watery
from
a
bottle
there
is
minimal
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
jet
black
color
minimal
lacing
good
taste
solid
stout
would
buy
again
just
an
average
everyday
stout
a
slightly
late
to
develop
cascading
lighttomedium
brown
colored
densely
packed
frothy
lush
head
excellent
retention
the
head
turns
richer
and
creamier
as
it
begins
to
settle
a
bit
the
color
is
not
black
but
rather
a
deep
rich
mahogany
brown
that
allows
some
light
to
leak
in
around
the
edges
mostly
still
with
just
a
stray
carbonation
streak
here
and
there
sheets
of
lacing
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
spot
on
for
the
style
roasted
malt
coffee
milk
chocolate
the
three
aromas
ebb
and
flow
in
prominence
but
never
completely
disappear
the
palate
is
exactly
as
expected
brownie
batter
roasted
malts
bakers
chocolate
simple
straight
forward
and
uber
effective
sturdy
and
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
a
bit
chewy
lush
and
sleek
goes
down
easily
sip
after
sip
this
is
a
rock

teetering

amazing
beer
this
is
probably
one
the
best
stouts
available
a
must
try
for
all
stout
fans
heavy
dark
smooth
after
taste
i
wish
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
flavors
were
lacking
again
would
i
try
this
again
on
tap
maybe
i
would
give
it
another
chance
overall
a
forgettable
offering
from
nh
the
hatter
series
is
where
this
brewery
shines
this
is
a
tasty
secret
that
i
dont
think
gets
enough
credit
out
there
nice
and
creamy
smooth
overall
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
malty
roasty
earthy
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
smoky
ill
certainly
get
it
again
highly
recommended
o
subtlety
is
key
here
its
well
blended
with
no
rough
edges
a
solid
pick
for
the
style
maybe
im
a
little
jaded
or
my
expectation
was
higher
but
i
feel
like
something
is
missing
from
this
craft
nevertheless
its
still
a
smooth
and
solid
os
just
without
any
frills
creamy
dark
smooth
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
top
5
stout
quoth
the
raven
drink
some
more
eap
would
approve
mixed
six
from
uncle
mike
final
thoughts
sort
of
meh
beer
nicely
done
stylewise
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
on
nitro
overall
this
stout
is
very
good
the
poet
is
not
as
grainy
as
some
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
in
the
past
its
got
the
right
amount
of
smokiness
that
makes
it
enjoyable
and
the
drinkabilty
is
great
id
say
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
i
am
giving
this
beer
a
higher
overall
rating
because
overall
it
really
was
a
decent
beer
it
just
looked
crazy
weird
which
is
going
to
skew
this
rating
i
definitely
will
have
to
try
again
and
see
if
the
weird
particles
are
always
in
this
beer
a
light
smooth
stout
with
a
clean
taste
o
i
liked
this
a
lot
good
offering
cheers
o
super
impressed
with
this
great
aroma
nice
complex
and
wellbalanced
flavor
that
is
delicious
100
would
recommend
having
this
high
c
dont
like
hops
in
my
oatmeal
the
aroma
on
this
brew
had
me
right
away
deep
and
complex
roastiness
with
a
mostly
clean
yeast
profile
underneath
dark
cocoa
powder
roast
grains
and
oats
combine
favorably
and
i
am
left
craving
oatmeal
chocolate
chip
cookies
overall
very
nice
and
sweet
oatmeal
stout
with
a
great
feel
definitely
worth
a
try
particularly
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
hefty
stout
thats
on
the
sweeter
side
this
is
very
smooth
fullbodied
medium
carbonation
the
poet
is
nothing
to
write
prose
about
its
a
solid
and
serviceable
oatmeal
stout
that
neither
under
nor
overdelivers
more
than
just
your
runofthemill
stout
but
not
quite
a
fullblooded
overthetop
offering
either
this
occupies
for
me
anyhow
a
kind
of
takeitorleaveit
middle
ground
i
liked
it
enough
to
buy
one
six
pack
but
not
enough
to
buy
another
the
poet
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
tan
head
there
is
a
strong
sweet
aroma
good
hints
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
has
a
nice
big
roasted
malt
flavor
with
big
hints
of
sweetens
nice
flavors
but
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
overall
very
flavorful
but
a
bit
watery
overall
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
tatsed
o
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
really
on
point
all
the
way
enjoy
the
poet
pours
a
deep
hue
that
is
darker
than
the
most
sinful
soul
a
thick
layer
of
froth
rests
on
top
of
this
decadent
looking
brew
its
aroma
is
roasty
with
an
inkling
of
sweetness
very
inviting
indeed
the
restaurant
i
tasted
this
at
had
it
incorrectly
labeled
as
a
standard
stout
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
the
most
soft
bready
and
grainy
stout
that
has
ever
traversed
my
palate
the
fact
that
it
is
an
oatmeal
stout
makes
a
lot
more
sense
as
i
am
typing
this
review
from
my
notes
and
looking
upon
the
stats
its
quite
the
fine
example
of
said
style
and
surprisingly
full
flavored
for
only

a
delightful
nuance
within
the
flavor
as
well
the
mouth
feel
is
somewhat
syrupy
but
overall
would
be
best
described
as
extraordinarily
creamy
the
poet
you
and
i
shall
certainly
meet
again
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
sized
thick
brown
head
with
good
retention
smells
of
sweet
toasted
malts
roasted
nuts
molasses
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
most
everything
youll
see
in
your
average
stouts
aroma
is
here
the
taste
is
sweet
oats
remarkably
silky
subtle
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
nuts
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
smoked
wood
due
to
the
low
abv
this
one
goes
down
silky
smooth
medium
bodied
strongly
recommend
this
one
easy
to
drink
and
not
hard
to
knock
three
of
these
back
good
stout
not
my
favorite
but
a
nice
beer
interesting
finish
opaque
in
appearance
and
stunningly
rich
and
flavorful
excellent
charred
dark
grain
character
with
a
nice
counterbalancing
mild
sweetness
and
mellow
smoothness
o
well
done
all
around
this
oatmeal
stout
hits
all
the
marks
with
only
a
handful
of
oatmeal
stouts
to
choose
from
year
round
this
particular
beer
could
make
a
splash
in
the
market
here
if
the
brand
stays
visible
pours
dark
black
tan
thick
head
sweet
molasses
with
some
bread
notes
for
aroma
licorice
molasses
sweetish
some
chocolates
and
a
cream
aftertaste
a
decent
stout
for
sure
overall
okay
but
the
nose
is
weak
and
the
flavor
is
too
mild
up
front
theres
not
really
much
to
this
beer
unfortunately
average
at
best
and
not
something
worth
drinking
again
given
all
the
other
stuff
out
there
forget
this
one
the
flavor
more
closely
matches
the
stout
flavors
i
expect
some
coffee
a
bit
of
burnt
malt
rich
body
and
light
carbonation
bitter
but
brief
aftertaste
a
very
well
made
beer
about
as
much
roasty
flavor
and
sticky
body
as
you
can
pack
into
a
beer
of
this
low
abv
its
super
dark
impenetrable
to
light
and
barley
showing
a
quarter
inch
of
mocha
bubbles
on
the
edges
the
nose
is
real
dark
almost
burnt
barley
with
a
belgian
chocolate
undertone
and
a
sweetness
from
the
oats
the
body
is
velvety
smooth
but
enormously
heavy
palate
coating
and
sticky
almost
hard
to
swallow
its
also
a
little
tannic
in
the
flavor
sharp
for
a
second
which
doesnt
really
fit
with
the
tasted
marshmallow
flavor
i
get
here
bitter
roast
and
chocolate
in
the
finish
its
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
its
cool
how
intense
it
is
for
being
so
mild
on
the
alcohol
front
well
made
beer
but
not
one
of
my
personal
favorites
from
these
guys
taste
is
rich
roasted
malt
vanilla
and
cream
this
beer
has
a
great
chewy
body
that
lingers
i
would
pick
this
up
again
very
dark
color
smooth
flavor
with
hints
of
oatmeal
nice
smooth
taste
overall
an
oatmeal
stout
i
could
buy
again
drinks
smooth
and
velvetty
with
a
rich
roasted
malt
taste
theres
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
too
a
nice
drinking
beer
top
shelf
oatmeal
stout
my
go
to
after
samuel
smiths
curve
setter
o
tasty
and
easy
drinker
nice
example
of
a
kick
ass
stout
very
much
a
stout
not
bad
at
all
among
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
lots
of
roasted
barley
creamy
smooth
body
not
exactly
complex
but
not
onenote
either
great
beer
compares
favorably
with
founders
oatmeal
stout
appearance
very
dark
and
appealing
head
was
not
very
impressive
but
that
was
likely
my
own
fault
in
the
pour
smell
the
nose
is
enticing
i
smell
bitterness
and
some
alcohol
notes
i
can
definitely
smell
the
oatmeal
as
well
so
far
not
my
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
but
still
very
nice
tastemouthfeel
bitter
but
combined
with
the
oatmeal
flavor
the
taste
is
quite
pleasant
very
creamy
with
oats
and
malt
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
enjoyable
but
not
monumental
flavors
from
initial
taste
to
aftertaste
it
is
quite
subtle
and
does
not
call
attention
to
itself
from
someone
who
loves
milk
stouts
this
is
an
excellent
beer
t
wellrounded
beer
artistically
crafted
remnants
of
char
after
a
sweet
toffee
and
rolled
oat
start
sweet
brown
malts
parlay
into
a
bittersweet
chocolate
leading
to
a
roasted
coffee
finish
all
flavors
combine
to
create
a
slight
licorice
effect
with
the
sweetness
covering
the
medicinal
char
id
be
drinking
this
medicine
everyday
o
okay
oatmeal
stout
but
probably
wouldnt
be
something
i
would
drink
regularly
prost
pours
black
like
stouts
do
pours
with
small
head
after
a
few
minutes
no
head
whatsoever
and
no
lacing
nose
is
actually
quote
hoppy
thats
almost
all
i
smell
i
dont
smell
any
chocolate
or
coffee
like
i
usually
do
in
an
oatmeal
stout
well
yeah
some
coffee
notes
for
sure
taste
is
also
hoppier
than
i
expected
nice
milk
chocolate
taste
and
creamy
mouthfeel
pours
black
with
a
slight
khaki
head
aroma
is
roasty
chocolate
toffee
slight
coffee
tones
and
oats
flavor
follow
suit
with
just
a
touch
of
char
in
the
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
sweeter
than
i
generally
care
drank
my
six
pack
of
it
thats
enough
cocoa
roast
and
earthiness
dominates
the
flavor
upfront
theres
a
smaller
fruit
note
of
black
cherry
that
mellows
with
the
usual
stout
malt
punch
hops
finish
with
herbal
spiciness
that
plays
with
a
bubbly
carbonation
towards
the
end
oats
do
wonders
for
the
mouthfeel
almost
creamy
nice
and
solid
great
appearance
great
aroma
great
mouthfeel
awesome
surprise
overall
not
bad
pretty
nice
oatmeal
stout
actually
the
nose
was
a
little
lacking
but
the
taste
brought
some
nice
darker
malts
nice
oats
with
a
little
dark
chocolate
or
semi
sweet
nice
kick
of
hops
on
the
back
end
decent
finish
a
touch
syrupy
and
sweet
but
not
bad
pretty
enjoyable
even
for
a
warm
summer
afternoon
enjoyable
beer
in
the
top
of
the
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
overall
an
amazing
stout
very
well
balanced
in
every
way
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
excellent
both
stylistically
and
overall
overall
its
hot
and
humid
here
in
boston
but
this
was
a
god
choice
in
my
nice
air
conditioned
room
m
too
thin
this
beer
would
benefit
from
some
added
viscosity
and
a
but
less
carbonation
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
nice
that
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
have
several
nice
approachable
stout
i
like
the
slightly
sweet
bent
as
opposed
to
the
typical
roast
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
offputting

12
oz
bottle
from
brewery
bitter
but
nice
light
chocolate
aroma
hints
of
malt
and
coffee
rolls
back
on
the
tongue
upon
first
taste
and
finishes
with
a
little
sweetness
at
the
end
pours
with
a
thin
smooth
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
as
the
glass
empties
oatmeal
comes
through
mid
taste
but
fades
quickly
and
adds
a
nice
touch
outstanding
oatmeal
stout
recommended
o
this
one
just
works
its
a
good
mix
of
roasty
and
sweet
without
ever
being
overpowering
my
only
real
nitpick
is
that
it
seems
a
bit
too
fizzy
on
the
palate
if
i
could
get
it
locally
i
cant
id
put
it
on
my
buy
again
list
pours
almost
pitch
black
with
an
average
sized
tan
head
aroma
is
roasted
malts
almonds
and
chocolates
smells
very
sweet
taste
is
a
creamy
coffee
malt
that
goes
down
very
smooth
somewhat
of
a
heavy
beer
unpleasant
aftertaste
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
for
me
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
full
complex
flavor
can
still
be
packed
into
beers
of
lower
abv
i
had
heard
decent
things
about
this
one
but
didnt
know
it
was
going
to
be
so
good
highly
recommended
o
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
with
nice
roasted
notes
not
the
most
complex
stout
ive
had
but
a
good
beer
to
revisit
overall
my
first
oatmeal
stout
and
i
am
enjoying
it
i
am
more
partial
to
thicker
higher
abv
stouts
but
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
flavorful
for
around
5
abv
recommended
this
is
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
has
a
beautiful
dark
mahogany
look
to
it
and
pours
with
a
a
nice
two
inch
tancream
head
extremely
smooth
for
a
dark
beer
and
very
full
flavored
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
the
smell
isnt
as
impressive
as
the
taste
of
the
beer
but
hey
taste
is
what
matters
in
my
book
ive
had
many
oatmeal
stouts
as
its
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
just
got
lucky
the
liquor
store
got
a
fresh
batch
in
this
week
the
downside
is
if
you
find
it
and
since
its
not
dated
you
get
an
out
of
date
bottle
you
will
loose
that
nice
head
and
it
will
have
kind
of
a
flat
taste
make
sure
you
buy
this
from
someone
whos
beer
move
o
easy
to
drink
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
deceptive
after
smelling
was
afraid
it
wouldnt
be
very
tasty
so
wrong
really
complex
beer
in
fact
so
complex
i
am
not
sure
my
notes
are
really
accurate
or
doing
the
beer
justice
really
enjoyable
to
drink
this
stout
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
short
lasting
one
finger
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
film
and
average
lacing
the
nose
is
dominated
by
roasted
coffee
beans
and
milk
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
superbly
creamy
and
smooth
it
just
begs
for
another
sip
the
flavor
surpasses
the
aroma
with
a
gentle
sweetness
that
balances
the
bitterness
of
the
roasted
coffee
notes
there
is
also
vanilla
chocolate
and
s
little
english
toffee
present
it
really
is
a
delicious
and
easily
drinkable
lighter
stout
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
offerings
that
ive
had
from
new
holland
good
work
very
nice
forgot
how
good
this
one
is
one
of
new
hollands
better
beers
so
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
dark
black
with
12
fingers
of
cloudy
head
falling
slowly
to
a
creamy
collar
leaving
lots
of
lacing
there
is
a
nice
nose
not
huge
but
present
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
toasted
and
dark
roasted
grains
the
taste
follows
suit
but
lso
brings
a
pleasing
bread
character
and
lots
of
creamy
oats
there
is
a
big
body
considering
the
meager
5
2
abv
with
nicve
carbonation
resultant
in
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
there
is
great
depth
to
the
poet
excellent
oatmeal
stout
interesting
how
the
oatmeal
could
round
the
bold
roasted
notes
i
also
loved
its
hop
profile
that
elegantly
emerges
from
this
strong
backbone
and
this
is
not
an
extreme
beer
it
is
actually
very
friendly
i
had
to
keep
raising
its
rating
as
it
warmed
up
and
further
freed
its
flavors
and
aroma
overall
an
extremely
delicious
oatmeal
stout
there
is
a
great
depth
to
the
flavor
and
the
roastchocolate
is
incredible
definitely
a
beer
to
seek
out
the
aroma
and
appearance
of
this
stout
cry
drink
me
however
the
watery
characteristic
and
the
finishing
bitterness
detract
from
its
enjoyment
nutty
smoky
aroma
mixed
with
a
nice
ale
smell
dark
chocolate
char
taste
the
finish
is
quite
nice
let
this
one
warm
up
to
near
room
temperature
and
the
various
flavors
really
come
out
pours
a
near
pitch
black
w
a
quarter
of
an
inch
brownish
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
is
left
along
the
glass
as
you
finish
the
smell
is
superb
hints
of
cocoa
caramel
malt
very
vital
aroma
the
taste
follows
suit
you
get
mostly
the
roasted
cocoachocolate
taste
mixed
with
a
heavier
than
expected
but
appropriate
carbonation
id
almost
call
this
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
very
enjoyable
o
i
get
oatmeal
makes
stouts
sweeter
but
this
one
did
not
add
the
smoothness
that
the
oats
bring
with
it
it
is
an
ok
to
good
beer
but
given
how
many
stoutsoatmeal
stouts
i
like
more
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
one
overall
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
pretty
close
to
a
fullbodied
stout
definitely
a
brew
stout
lovers
should
check
out
o
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
pretty
rich
in
chocolate
flavors
nice
and
creamy
i
would
have
again
overall
great
beer
try
it
out
price
point
2
1912
oz
single
cheers
we
would
buy
it
for
ourselves
drinkability
as
good
as
american
stout
gets
and
it
proves
you
dont
have
to
add
chocolate
flavors
fruit
or
alcohol
to
make
great
stout
a
must
try
stout
o
though
dark
and
sinister
in
appearance
the
poet
is
a
seductive
chocolaty
beer
thats
silky
smooth
yet
roasted
and
bitter
for
an
exceptional
balance
and
longlasting
finish
quite
possibly
the
benchmark
for
the
style
the
poet
is
one
of
new
hollands
stunning
achievements
in
zymurgy
overall
very
much
enjoyed
this
one
but
take
it
at
room
temp
to
fully
appreciate
it
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
only
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
hints
of
robust
malts
and
toasted
oats
the
taste
is
sweet
smooth
and
full
of
rich
flavor
it
has
a
nice
texture
for
its
pricing
as
its
not
the
heavy
syrup
stouts
you
would
get
from
a
154pack
drinks
very
nice
and
is
well
made
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
flavoring
through
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
we
were
given
and
evenkeeled
easy
light
brew
nothing
really
stood
too
far
out
but
rather
all
the
notes
characters
and
nuances
blended
together
for
an
easily
appreciated
final
product
while
each
sip
gave
decent
froth
and
cream
this
coupled
with
the
chalky
dryness
left
around
the
mouth
proved
to
show
a
lacking
of
that
soft
silky
mouthfeel
that
you
might
have
come
to
expect
from
the
style
this
slowed
drinkability
a
bit
but
the
general
ease
and
inclusiveness
of
flavoring
helped
to
push
through
it
in
the
end
although
the
beer
may
not
live
entirely
up
to
the
ominous
tone
set
by
its
name
and
label
it
keeps
the
drinker
interested
long
enough
to
enjoy
it
to
the
last
sip
mouthfeel
smooth
and
slippery
a
almost
water
feel
but
then
collides
through
a
sweetooth
of
nectar
really
suburb
oatmeal
stout
o
great
outmeal
stout
very
drinkable
with
very
nice
flavor
pours
almost
a
solid
black
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
laces
nicely
around
the
rim
nice
aroma
of
molasses
caramel
and
chocolate
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
perfect
balance
of
flavor
in
every
mouthful
too
bad
i
just
bought
a
single
one
of
these
as
this
is
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
theres
a
nice
taste
and
a
bit
of
complexity
in
the
feel
the
alcohol
makes
it
somewhat
sessionable
and
being
an
oatmeal
stout
it
goes
down
easily
overall
next
to
a
seriously
aged
pilgrams
dole
this
is
my
favorite
new
holland
beer
balanced
and
easy
drinking
a
great
representation
of
the
style
lots
of
coffee
char
and
some
dry
chocolate
theres
slight
burnt
oat
taste
but
not
enough
variance
to
achieve
high
scores
very
good
but
slightly
weak
this
is
a
nice
starter
stout
for
those
wanting
to
delve
into
the
genre
overall
a
well
done
oatmeal
stout
the
sweetness
was
left
to
go
a
little
wild
without
the
hop
character
to
tone
it
down
overall
a
bit
lackluster
for
an
oatmeal
stout
misses
on
a
few
counts
and
feels
less
than
cohesive
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
but
its
not
something
id
purchaseorder
unless
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
category
available
overall
one
if
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
wish
i
could
get
it
in
louisiana
and
would
of
brought
more
home
from
ohio
a
better
than
average
oatmeal
stout
approachable
and
being
able
to
drink
a
couple
without
fatiguing
the
palate
or
getting
too
much
alcohol
aids
drinkability
theres
nothing
outright
bad
here
but
it
lacks
any
real
character
that
would
make
me
want
to
revisit
it
quite
smooth
and
very
subdued
it
left
me
wanting
something
with
more
gusto
o
a
really
nice
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout

with

a

decomposes
a

packed

finishes
both
residual
and
very
dry
with

smc
overall
this
is
a
big
sturdy
stout
to
enjoy
on
its
own
or
with
a
good
meal
definitely
a
good
pickup
for
fans
of
coffee
stouts
and
oatmeal
stouts
the
taste
also
brings
out
the
dark
malt
and
oatmeal
character
with
a
mild
dry
bitterness
to
finish
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
from
maine
pours
dark
brown
with
a
little
tan
foam
on
top
and
a
bit
fizzy
rich
roasted
oaty
nose
taste
is
a
hearty
wall
of
oats
coffee
grittiness
then
suddenly
a
smooth
finish
mild
bitter
good
close
a
little
milky
but
not
in
a
sweet
stout
kind
of
way
o
a
tasty
stout
although
the
initial
aroma
belies
the
heavy
smoky
taste
not
terribly
easy
drinking
due
to
the
smoky
taste
and
lingering
tobacco
ashy
flavor
might
be
good
with
a
cigar
though
for
that
reason
o
overall
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
from
new
england
area
maine
for
sure
and
they
know
cold
weather
and
hot
coffee
this
is
a
great
substitute
for
that
i
would
think
about
this
one
for
breakfast
very
yummy
solid
oatmeal
stout
with
an
emphasis
on
dark
roast
malts
nice
cocoa
flavor
throughout
the
experience
flavor
seems
to
thin
out
just
a
bit
after
some
time
but
still
nothing
wrong
here
at
all
mouthfeel
takes
a
hit
because
of
the
extra
carbonation
though
its
not
overwhelming
its
a
little
too
much
it
also
takes
a
hit
because
while
it
looks
thick
it
feels
a
bit
thinner
than
it
should
be
this
is
one
very
drinkable
stout
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
stout
and
could
easily
spend
the
night
drinking
these
overall
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
too
bad
they
have
to
make
it
in
portland
and
not
in
belfast
bay
still
an
awesome
though
yields
over
two
fingers
of
superdark
brown
foam
very
airy
and
loose
fizzing
off
at
a
quick
pace
plenty
of
dimpling
along
the
way
to
a
thin
surface
coating
left
behind
minimal
lacing
to
be
had
the
liquid
itself
is
jet
black
with
the
vaguest
hint
of
orange
at
the
rims
the
nose
feels
firm
and
in
no
way
soft
focuses
on
dark
chocolate
coffee
scone
anise
seed
no
truly
sugary
component
involved
the
oats
dried
rather
than
cooked
or
even
cookie
status
its
sufficiently
densely
packed
that
even
the
roast
doesnt
lift
much
mild
hoppiness
comes
through
at
warmer
temperatures
mediumbodied
noticeably
dry
and
chewy
again
the
oats
and
grains
seem
uncooked
and
dusty
even
comes
across
as
semibitter
heavy
on
the
roasted
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
cocoa
and
then
black
licorice
and
dried
orange
peels
hard
to
truly
peg
the
hops
for
the
pucker
factor
near
the
end
maybe
yes
maybe
no
carbonation
seems
low
given
the
density
of
the
material
with
each
additional
sip
you
cant
help
but
wish
it
were
a
little
sweeter
with
more
length
no
fruit
nor
something
like
caramel
vanilla
in
the
end
feels
traditional
but
not
so
much
a
fun
style
of
stout
to
kick
back
with
and
spend
an
evening
notes
such
a
great
oatmeal
stout
drinkable
and
very
hearty
cheers
overall
not
sure
where
i
can
pick
up
some
more
since
this
was
an
online
beer
but
i
welcome
another
at
another
day
down
the
road
until
then
barley
flats
oatmeal
stout
will
have
to
do
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
nothing
outstanding
but
worth
trying
for
sure
great
brew
nice
not
filling
or
cloying
highly
drinkable
glad
i
saw
this
o
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
these
and
i
would
enjoy
that
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
favor
and
a
wonderful
appearance
very
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
o
not
a
bad
stout
this
is
more
of
a
dessert
beer
since
the
chocolatey
tones
come
out
fairly
strong
id
probably
have
this
again
depending
what
was
served
not
terribly
great
not
really
too
much
to
say
about
it
a
very
boring
bland
beer
o
the
mediumbodied
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
pretty
good
would
be
better
if
they
used
slightly
less
black
patent
malt
or
heavy
crystal
malts
or
maybe
there
is
a
hint
of
roast
that
shouldnt
be
there
whatever
the
light
burnt
overroasted
malt
flavor
with
a
light
acrid
and
chalky
feel
takes
away
a
bit
otherwise
very
tasty
and
done
well
a
nice
full
winter
beer
that
wont
knock
you
on
your
ass
after
2
of
them
smells
roasty
and
a
bit
acidic
which
carries
over
into
the
taste
the
usual
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nuttiness
of
a
good
os
is
missing
instead
its
somewhat
overly
bitter
acrid
and
just
plain
rough
maybe
too
aggressively
hopped
for
the
style
resembles
more
of
a
low
abv
ris
than
an
oatmeal
stout
found
myself
wincing
a
bit
with
each
mouthful
and
looking
forward
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
one
a
great
beer
for
the
style
and
a
much
more
enjoyable
one
after
having
recently
had
dark
horse
one
this
one
is
a
winner
really
enjoyed
it
itd
be
funny
to
think
that
the
brewers
chose
this
name
over
both
muskies
and
humprheys
maybe
ahem
anyway
it
pours
a
straight
onyx
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
offkhaki
foam
the
node
comprises
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
light
coffee
and
molasses
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
roast
really
getting
kicked
up
the
coffee
and
chocolate
turning
bitter
and
acrid
and
some
light
vinyl
and
tobacco
entering
the
fray
as
well
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
okay
oatmeal
stout
but
one
that
lacks
the
smoothness
the
finesse
the
creaminess
the
softness
that
usually
comes
with
the
style
its
still
alright
just
nothing
i
would
consider
great
overall
highly
drinkable
drinkability
i
wish
id
have
opted
for
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
its
a
pretty
complex
one
for
the
style
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
have
a
chance
the
brew
pours
with
a
look
typical
of
a
nice
stout
black
with
a
tan
cap
though
it
is
a
shortlived
head
the
nose
is
equal
parts
of
cocoa
roast
and
toffeecoffeecaramelcandy
notes
but
it
is
not
sweet
it
tastes
about
the
same
as
the
nose
but
it
adds
a
pleasantly
acrid
roast
and
smoke
hint
to
the
mix
feel
is
medium
soft
and
creamy
with
a
super
drying
mouthfeel
a
tad
reminiscent
of
black
coffee
quite
nice
overall
very
roasty
aroma
charcoal
nearly
burnt
malt
and
smoke
plus
unfortunately
a
little
plastic
and
bandaid
scent
the
beer
is
dry
intensely
dry
with
the
roasted
character
carrying
through
from
the
smell
no
malt
or
hops
in
the
flavor
just
a
lot
of
malt
and
grain
fleeting
alcohol
in
the
taste
moderate
bitterness
and
a
mediumtolight
body
for
an
oatmeal
stout
not
a
bad
beer
although
the
creamy
full
texture
that
i
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
was
entirely
lacking
first
sip
reveals
a
light
body
with
average
carbonation
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
burnt
malt
and
brown
sugar
mixing
not
too
complex
also
still
find
no
hop
presence
or
hint
of
abv
a
pretty
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
that
is
nice
and
roasty
but
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
i
would
like
more
with
a
little
mor
thickness
still
i
could
and
would
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
if
i
had
the
beer
around

and
oats
emphasis
on
the
coffee
bitterness
has
a
much
thinner
body
than
i
had
expected
a
little
acidic
reminds
me
too
much
of
a
strong
black
coffee
rather
than
a
beer
o
a
really
enjoyable
sunday
afternoon
brew
on
a
cold
spring
day
wish
it
was
local
around
here
so
i
could
stock
up
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
session
brew
d
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
emerges
as
it
warms
up
making
it
a
touch
better
but
its
still
not
very
good
and
i
doubt
most
people
would
wait
that
long
mikes
drain
got
much
of
this
one
d
this
is
not
a
good
beer
it
tastes
pour
and
drinks
hard
for
its
5
1
d
the
nose
was
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
just
a
failure
not
a
fan
of
this
one
da
good
brew
overall
but
there
are
much
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
black
black
black
as
it
oozes
from
the
bottle
into
the
glass
its
incredible
how
thick
this
beer
looks
and
how
utterly
black
it
is
are
there
shades
of
blackness
decent
but
unspectacular
aroma
of
toasted
stuff
typical
for
the
style
with
a
sharpness
that
seems
unusual
rather
watery
body
given
the
thickness
of
the
beer
with
appropriately
light
carbonation
the
first
few
sips
were
tasty
and
toasty
and
smooth
very
nice
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
started
tasting
more
and
more
like
soap
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
felt
like
my
grandmother
had
risen
from
the
grave
and
was
following
through
on
her
threats
of
40
years
ago
washing
out
my
mouth
with
soap
have
i
been
swearing
excessively
lately
sorry
but
soapy
beer
yeesh
thats
enough
to
make
anyone
curse
pours
a
deep
brown
nearly
black
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
strong
roasty
smell
with
coffee
notes
creamy
mouthfeel
with
roasted
malt
taste
with
just
enough
sweetness
and
no
alcohol
present
overall
good
representation
of
the
style
and
very
sessionable
at
a
great
price
not
world
class
but
an
enjoyable
beer
i
would
certainly
have
again
very
drinkable
beer
a
good
session
beer
cause
you
just
cant
drink
one
d
i
want
to
sit
down
to
a
bowl
of
this
every
morning
and
every
night
for
dessert
this
is
such
a
versatile
beer
im
definitely
grabbing
another
6er
of
this
asap
i
only
bought
one
bottle
this
time
but
i
can
easily
see
myself
going
back
for
a
full
6
pack
i
have
had
a
few
better
tasting
oatmeal
stouts
including
youngs
sam
smiths
and
founders
d
really
easy
to
put
down
low
abv
grab
a
sixer
jet
black
with
a
nice
small
head
at
first
mild
espresso
and
cocoa
aroma
deep
roasted
flavoralmost
to
a
burnt
degree
but
it
is
not
unpleasant
some
hop
bitterness
lacks
the
creamy
flavor
and
the
silkiness
of
a
good
oatmeal
stout
body
is
a
tad
thinagain
no
sign
of
oats
in
here
a
decent
enough
stout
their
website
has
a
talking
lobster
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
have
always
had
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
stouts
and
maine
def
worth
a
try
especially
if
it
is
cold
outside
that
being
said
if
you
want
an
oatmeal
stout
that
will
blow
your
mind
go
with
the
sammy
smiths
cheers
this
is
a
decent
beer
pretty
much
bang
on
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
a
tad
chewy
and
thick
very
drinkable
but
this
beer
cloys
rather
rapidly
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
session
stout
for
sure
dark
tan
head
with
slight
coffee
and
roasted
barley
smell
and
hints
of
malt
this
starts
sweet
with
smooth
mouth
feel
over
the
tongue
with
noticeable
bubbles
on
the
tip
big
roasted
barley
taste
that
lingers
into
your
next
sip
the
second
sip
is
better
then
the
first
the
sweet
malt
taste
and
the
roasted
barley
make
for
a
wonderful
beer
pours
a
staright
blac
with
brownie
highlights
and
a
nice
one
finger
brown
head
the
aroma
is
a
nice
roasted
malt
but
pretty
astringent
smelling
coffee
with
maybe
a
drizzle
of
cream
the
taste
starts
roasted
creamy
and
smooth
then
gets
a
little
tart
and
acidic
the
finish
a
slightly
vinegarish
coffee
palate
goes
from
smooth
to
tart
ok
oatmeal
stout
taht
could
use
a
litle
less
tartness
very
dark
and
rich
body
with
a
one
inch
dark
brown
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
film
quickly
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
dark
chocolate
as
well
as
cherry
and
light
vanilla
flavor
is
dry
and
roasted
with
some
burnt
malt
coming
out
on
the
lightly
hoppy
finish
very
full
flavored
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
active
fizzy
carbonation
texture
is
more
watery
than
anything
else
with
a
little
chalkiness
on
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
full
of
flavor
and
a
really
nice
surprise
it
tastes
more
like
a
dry
stout
than
an
oatmeal
stout
but
very
tasty
none
the
less
pitch
black
in
the
pour
very
volitile
in
the
pour
thick
huge
dark
tan
head
but
does
not
lace
as
well
as
head
would
lead
you
to
believe
on
the
dry
side
very
mild
bitterness
very
balanced
in
taste
hints
of
dark
fuit
and
coffee
nice
feeling
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
a
highly
drinkable
stout
moreys
bottom
line
without
a
doubt
the
best
stout
that
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
not
quite
as
good
as
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
but
pretty
darn
good
its
just
not
quite
silky
enough
due
to
its
thin
mouthfeel
d
crazy
drinkable
balanced
well
very
tasty
if
you
like
stouts
this
is
one
to
sit
with
for
an
evening
and
a
half
all
in
all
this
is
a
tasty
oatmeal
stout
i
have
yet
to
find
one
that
matches
up
with
sammy
smiths
but
were
getting
closer
with
this
one
cheers
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
black
in
color
with
a
slight
brown
head
that
settles
to
skim
within
a
few
minutes
there
is
barely
any
lace
left
on
the
glass
it
is
extremely
opaque
you
cant
see
anything
through
it
the
oatmeal
stout
smells
of
roasted
grains
and
malt
with
some
nuttiness
it
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
bitterness
at
the
end
the
bitterness
and
coffee
flavor
lingers
after
you
swallow
it
has
a
medium
body
that
is
strengthened
by
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
normal
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
too
exceptional
it
does
feel
very
smooth
going
down
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
i
remember
liking
it
more
when
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
old
belfast
bay
brewpub
the
bottle
im
reviewing
had
been
in
the
refrigerator
all
afternoon
so
it
was
quite
cold
when
poured
now
that
it
is
warming
up
im
enjoying
the
beer
more
d
i
think
ill
have
another
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
poured
out
of
12oz
bottle
this
elixir
resembles
a
dark
coffe
like
liquer
with
a
nice
head
profile
of
creamy
coffee
foam
aromas
are
mild
containing
sweet
oats
and
malt
hay
and
roasted
porridge
flavors
are
nicer
than
the
aromas
serving
up
a
meritage
of
dark
cocoa
roasted
gruel
blackened
grog
and
nice
sweet
oatmeal
on
the
finish
a
decent
offering
for
consumers
to
seek
out
this
tasted
much
better
as
it
warmed
up
and
i
recommend
bringing
this
to
almost
room
temperature
to
enjoy
the
full
palate
of
flavors
out
of
a
bottle
this
brew
was
an
opaque
black
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
the
retention
was
less
than
stellar
but
the
lacing
was
decent
the
aroma
was
rather
chocolaty
with
some
roasted
malt
light
coffee
and
molasses
the
flavors
were
solid
and
robust
starting
on
a
note
of
roasted
malt
i
then
tasted
the
light
chocolate
followed
by
oats
earthiness
and
a
long
coffee
finish
pleasantly
bitter
but
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
rich
the
body
was
full
and
the
carbonation
excellent
for
the
style
though
nothing
about
the
beer
was
outstanding
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
thought
it
a
good
overall
example
of
the
style
a
brew
of
impenetrable
black
it
gives
off
a
roasty
aroma
of
burnt
vegetables
the
taste
however
is
of
dark
coffee
grounds
with
a
bit
of
oats
and
soy
sauce
it
grows
on
you
with
each
sip
there
a
sticky
mouthfeel
that
clings
to
the
palate
with
a
bit
a
dryness
average
drinkability
doesnt
wow
doesnt
offend
but
fails
to
distinguish
itself
among
oatmeal
stouts
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
good
strong
brown
head
leaving
some
sticking
roasty
almost
salt
sweet
malts
in
the
nose
the
malt
character
in
flavor
is
obviously
dominant
notes
of
chocolate
and
hints
at
coffee
the
subtlest
flavor
of
soy
sauce
smooth
drinking
lightmedium
bodied
stout
low
carbonation
i
could
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
d
i
could
see
myself
downing
a
few
of
these
although
i
would
most
likely
do
it
after
dinner
a
very
nice
stout
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
for
me
its
the
definition
of
dessert
beer
and
something
to
always
keep
on
hand
drinkability
probably
only
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
not
a
session
beer
but
great
for
desert
or
a
reward
d
not
unpleasant
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
the
overall
flavor
is
a
little
watered
down
though
notes
from
91807
tastes
excellent
sweet
and
lightly
sour
porter
malts
start
things
off
moving
quickly
into
bitter
roasted
malt
with
heavy
nodes
of
hearty
grain
and
dark
chocolate
dry
stout
hops
come
in
near
the
end
blending
wonderfully
with
the
sour
remnants
of
the
malt
superb
overly
fizzy
on
the
tongue
palate
a
sharp
effervescence
lightmedium
body
a
touch
watery
at
times
slightly
warming
in
the
throat
alright
but
needs
some
tweaking
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
earthy
scent
that
has
a
wonderful
oatmeal
feel
its
very
bitter
from
the
over
use
of
black
patent
malts
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
its
quite
bitter
with
loads
of
black
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
thin
with
some
lingering
earthiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
although
im
not
sure
how
they
won
the
silver
medal
at
the
world
beer
championships
motor
oil
black
and
a
little
syrupy
in
the
pour
pours
a
light
tan
head
thats
about
two
fingers
and
it
stays
awhile
sweet
malts
pervade
my
nostrils
with
minor
hints
of
dryroasted
malts
anywhere
a
little
creamy
but
definitely
smooth
they
really
polished
this
beer
with
the
oats
medium
to
fullbodied
with
light
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fluffy
and
feeling
but
there
is
still
a
good
sweetmalt
taste
and
it
passes
down
the
throat
effortlessly
and
with
a
dry
backbite
that
complements
it
perfectly
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
very
good
beer
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
some
chocolate
to
go
with
it
black
body
with
a
frothy
chocolate
milk
looking
head
head
takes
some
time
to
fall
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
in
its
place
smells
of
licorice
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
dry
and
smooth
roasted
bitterness
and
some
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
beer
is
nice
and
goes
down
well
if
it
was
available
here
i
would
buy
again
drinkability
proteus93
put
it
best
its
like
they
tried
to
do
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
but
just
fell
a
little
short
its
good
but
its
a
little
off
in
a
number
of
ways
the
soy
sauce
note
for
instance
drinkability
is
nice
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
im
pleasantly
surpised
try
it
d
hearty
rich
flavor
decently
brewed
but
doesnt
stand
out
as
an
oatmeal
served
in
a
standard
pint
pour
was
all
head
mochacolored
dense
and
rocky
with
a
honeycomb
of
holes
visible
through
the
sides
of
the
glass
brew
was
colacolored
with
some
ruby
red
hightlights
around
the
edges
no
lacing
adhered
during
the
tasting
scents
of
cooca
coffee
malt
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
alcohol
taste
is
consistent
with
nose
but
im
also
picking
up
a
little
dark
fruit
in
the
mix
as
well
as
a
roastedburnt
quality
and
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
a
little
too
carbonated
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
which
detracted
from
the
overall
mouthfeel
slightly
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
great
nose
and
flavor
profile
makes
this
a
solid
offering
and
well
worth
your
time
m
d
decently
creamy
and
it
could
even
get
heavier
without
hurting
things
typically
oatmeal
stouts
are
nice
session
brews
having
full
flavour
rich
body
and
a
low
abv
this
takes
it
up
a
notch
with
an
alleged
6
5
a
little
heavy
nonetheless
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
and
well
worth
trying
out
wow
this
immediately
reminds
me
of
the
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
the
roasted
and
burnt
barley
flavor
only
plays
a
small
part
while
the
coffeelike
grains
and
cocoa
come
together
beautifully
the
only
problem
i
had
was
that
one
of
my
bottles
was
overcarbonated
otherwise
it
was
a
gorgeous
black
with
light
brown
head
and
matching
lacing
with
a
smooth
body
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
tried
worth
finding
drinkability
tastey
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try
my
first
from
this
company
seems
they
only
make
a
few
anyway
i
drank
this
one
down
fairly
quickly
and
couldve
drank
a
couple
more
mouthfeel
drinkability
good
mouthfeel
but
it
can
get
lost
in
the
taste
not
at
all
drinkable
maybe
a
bad
bottle
thanks
to
deltatauhobbit
for
this
as
an
extra
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
caused
by
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
you
definitely
need
to
pour
this
one
with
care
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
like
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malts
with
some
coffee
flavors
in
the
bittersweet
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
stout
that
is
recommended
however
due
to
the
excessive
amount
of
carbonation
i
did
not
get
to
enjoy
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
typically
associated
with
oatmeal
stouts
mcgoverns
oatmeal
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
an
out
of
control
huge
brown
head
the
aroma
is
nice
roasted
malt
all
the
way
the
flavor
is
also
nice
once
again
its
roasted
malt
just
as
i
would
expect
there
is
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
but
mostly
its
just
coffee
like
flavors
pretty
good
poured
into
a
snifter
mcgoverns
pours
a
rich
solid
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
bottle
i
got
was
over
carbonated
so
nearly
the
whole
glass
was
head
on
my
first
pour
after
waiting
i
poured
the
rest
and
after
mellowing
out
for
a
bit
the
head
finally
settled
at
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
mild
lacing
aromas
are
of
chocolate
yeast
and
bittersweet
malts
taste
was
chocolaty
with
that
sweet
malt
goodness
no
significant
hop
quality
mouthfeel
may
be
misjudged
due
to
the
high
carbonation
but
the
stout
was
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
another
of
these
so
i
see
if
the
carbonation
level
differs
but
it
is
a
tasty
stout
and
i
did
enjoy
it
after
letting
it
settle
md
the
ending
sweetness
lends
a
great
smoothness
easy
to
drink
and
easier
to
enjoy
a
well
crafted
brew
this
is
one
very
drinkable
stout
and
a
great
stout
at
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
stout
and
could
easily
spend
the
night
drinking
these
pours
pitch
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
is
pretty
big
nose
is
roasted
malts
that
have
a
very
slightly
smoked
quality
to
it
flavor
is
heavily
smoked
malts
off
the
first
sip
i
wonder
if
it
will
be
too
much
we
shall
see
interesting
something
just
hit
my
brain
blue
cheese
you
know
that
funky
edge
you
get
off
some
blue
cheeses
that
is
what
i
just
pulled
off
this
and
in
a
firm
way
feel
has
a
full
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
good
too
overall
a
good
stout
definitely
well
bodied
and
with
a
defined
character
worth
trying
very
drinkable
beer
for
stout
people
extremely
drinkable
one
of
th
ebest
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
ever
had
poured
into
my
guinness
pint
glass
a
near
pitch
black
except
for
just
a
few
highlights
of
ruby
a
huge
blooming
mocha
colored

milk
chocolate
and
vanilla
aromas
with
a
drifting
light
smokiness
a
tad
prickly
and
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
departmentflavors
a
roasty
with
some
wood
and
smoke
elements
quite
dry
even
earthy
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
decent
not
great
with
some
fine
tuning
it
could
be
really
good
as
is
above
average
overall
a
brawny
and
raw
stout
easy
enough
to
drink
though
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
or
just
relax
and
drink
a
couple
of
them
slowly
to
be
honest
i
hadnt
had
anything
from
this
brewer
and
wasnt
really
expecting
too
much
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
bottom
line
with
this
one
the
fruitiness
ive
had
oatmeal
stouts
ive
enjoyed
more
with
my
brunch
to
have
this
again
pours
very
black
with
only
the
slightest
bit
of
reddish
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
big
head
from
the
pour
that
disappears
completely
aroma
of
rich
sticky
malts
predominate
expressed
as
dark
roasted
coffee
with
a
bit
of
cream
a
slight
buttery
almond
note
lurks
in
the
background
on
the
palate
malt
bitterness
bites
immediately
but
then
things
lighten
up
surprisingly
with
a
fruity
sourness
taking
over
at
the
mid
some
diacetyl
on
the
finish
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
the
flavors
would
necessarily
indicate
thats
helped
by
the
fact
that
carbonation
is
almost
nonexistent
overall
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
and
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
a
modest
sipper
here
the
flavor
bursts
through
in
the
end
my
2nd
beer
from
belfast
bay
and
both
have
been
very
good
a
very
pleasant
rounded
and
flavorful
oatmeal
stout
one
i
would
certainly
try
again
when
in
maine
overall
not
bad
but
not
one
id
go
out
to
get
a
tad
boring
that
said
nothing
major
wrong
with
it
worth
a
try

this
stout
poured
a
dark
brownblack
with
red
near
the
edges
if
held
to
the
light
with
huge
light
brown
foam
that
would
not
quit
the
foam
persisted
a
long
time
and
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
mildly
malty
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
oatmeal
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
some
roasty
malt
flavors
and
a
bit
of
oatmeal
and
moderate
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
mediumfull
body
and
medium
carbonation
this
was
a
good
stout
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
from
a
sample
i
had
on
tap
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
doesnt
really
rival
something
like
sam
smiths
but
good
certainly
one
to
check
out
if
youre
in
maine
in
a
colder
month
the
beer
erupted
from
the
12
ounce
brown
bottle
a
piceous
color
the
head
bunyanesque
in
size
spumescent
in
texture
and
a
nice
chocolate
brown
color
after
several
weeks
it
evaporate
and
the
resultant
lace
formed
a
nice
sticky
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
coffee
like
with
some
nice
toasted
grain
aromas
start
is
sweet
thick
with
the
top
middling
in
its

finish
has
a
moderate

the

pleasant

buds
quite
dry
and
a
decent
drinking
beer
thanks
once
again
to
carmen
for
this
bottle
pours
ink
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
head
quickly
settles
and
leaves
lacing
along
the
rim
of
the
glass
hints
of
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
this
beer
is
quite
smooth
flavors
of
toffee
roast
imparting
an
espresso
taste
and
bitterness
heavy
malt
all
washed
down
by
a
milkcream
aftertaste
quite
enjoyable
theres
a
lot
of
complex
flavor
in
this
bottle
yet
its
well
assembled
leading
to
a
great
balance
the
beer
by
mid
pint
gets
a
little
bit
dryer
and
the
bitterness
returns
well
crafted
for
the
style
and
would
be
a
good
benchmark
for
any
oatmeal
stout
this
is
what
an
oatmeal
stout
tastes
like
a
satisfying
stout
very
similar
to
harpoons
oatmeal
stout
which
is
definitely
a
compliment
wonderful
flavors
with
a
very
smooth
creamy
texture
and
excellent
balance
very
delicate
and
subtle
very
full
bodied
and
lingers
on
the
palette
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
although
it
is
my
first
time
from
a
bottle
right
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
stouts
brewed
in
maine
all
in
all
its
a
nicely
done
well
balanced
stout
im
still
looking
for
a
ne
brewer
to
outdo
the
ipswich
though
thats
the
standard
in
my
mind
this
beer
pours
clear
but
mostly
opaque
with
a
little
redbrown
black
color
that
seeps
through
right
around
the
edges
with
a
large
dissipating
dark
brown
head
the
mouthfeel
is
firm
to
oily
the
smell
is
of
roasted
coffee
the
taste
is
a
smokey
sweet
front
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
a
very
nice
smokey
flavored
stout
source
gift
me
this
deep
black
stout
presents
with
a
foamy
head
and
a
deep
roasted
malt
aroma
the
heavier
body
justly
supports
a
deep
roasted
dark
malt
flavor
and
i
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
tasty
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
wisp
of
tan
foam
not
bad
for
a
4
oz
sample
nice

flavorbitterness
seemed
more

malt
than

mouthfeel
was

with

finish
but

compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
overall
a
good
beer
will
try
to
resample
a
larger
pour
soon

offering
one

alaskan
beers
ive
had
big
oats
chocolate
caramel
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
nice
and
smooth
easy
drinking
stout
and
very
enjoyable
overall
hey
its
not
bad
in
fact
id
put
it
amongst
the
top
ten
or
maybe
five
stouts
ive
tried
better
than
most
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
i
recommend
it
perhaps
alaskan
is
better
at
their
darker
beers
chocolately
nose
mild
applelike
acidity
mildly
sweet
maltiness
balances
the
roasted
character
in
the
end
the
acidity
and
fairly
mild
roast
character
threw
me
off
a
little
although
i
did
like
the
sweetness
and
the
overall
range
of
flavors
o
a
solid
middle
of
the
road
beer
overall
its
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
im
pretty
sure
theres
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
id
rather
have
a
stout
that
packs
all
kinds
of
solidity
on
the
rare
occasions
that
i
drink
unimperial
stouts
this
is
certainly
something
that
will
suffice
it
is
a
stout
nonetheless
however
it
is
does
not
have
that
oatmeal
stout
taste
to
it
alaskan
brewing
co
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
beer
doesnt
settle
good
with
me
a
little
bit
of
home
for
an
alaskan
now
living
in
beervana
clean
easy
nothing
special
smooth
oaty
and
a
great
aftertaste
rating
a
medium
full
body
medium
to
medium
low
carbonation
o
ok
for
style
odecent
straightforward
stout
would
drink
this
again
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
but
nicely
lacing
white
head
there
is
a
weak
smokey
and
roasted
aroma
the
taste
has
a
sweet
smokey
and
roasted
flavors
the
flavors
are
a
bit
weak
and
the
feel
is
too
carbonated
overall
its
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
over
all
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
i
just
wish
there
was
just
a
bit
more
malt
punch
to
it
its
kind
of
watery
overall
above
average
to
good
beer
but
closer
to
average
worth
a
try
i
might
buy
this
again
but
there
are
better
baseline
stouts
out
there
for
the
same
price
or
less
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
dark
brown
with
fluffy
beige
head
aroma
is
of
bready
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
body
is
medium
creamy
and
smooth
taste
is
of
bready
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
coffee
and
dark
fruit
finish
is
long
and
semidry
not
their
best
brew
overall
very
enjoyable
i
would
reccomend
this
to
both
regular
stout
drinkers
and
people
who
are
trying
their
first
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
though
i
might
buy
this
again
theres
definately
better
options
out
there
it
hits
all
the
notes
for
the
style
with
an
added
extra
bitterness
overall
a
great
stout
i
dont
bring
in
a
lot
of
oatmeal
stouts
im
glad
i
did
this
one
a
personal
favorite
now
a
great
selection
for
someone
who
wants
a
no
frills
low
bitterness
stout
which
i
often
do
its
all
oats
and
grains
for
the
most
part
well
rounded
the
quality
of
this
beer
paired
with
its
cost
should
be
a
crowd
pleaser
to
experienced
stout
drinkers
and
those
going
there
for
the
first
time
overall
a
good
stout
especially
at
walmart
prices
ill
probably
have
this
again
o
im
drunk
but
its
tasty
and
worthy
of
another
and
what
more
can
you
ask
of
a
beer
really
o
yummy
oatmeal
stout
solid
flavour
profile
deliciously
simple
overall
a
rock
solid
if
a
bit
unspectacular
oatmeal
stout
there
is
nothing
to
comment
on
to
detract
from
the
quality
of
this
stout
a
solid
drinker
and
sessionable
to
boot
recommended
for
sampling
a
really
tasty
oatmeal
stout
overall
this
is
a
very
middle
of
the
road
stout
nothing
terrible
but
theres
absolutely
nothing
to
grab
your
attention
and
say
hey
thats
interesting
for
that
i
detest
it
very
plain
jane
and
boring
pours
dark
brown
with
a
slight
mocha
head
that
disapears
before
you
can
even
put
the
glass
down
this
is
a
tale
of
two
beers
cold
vs
warm
cold
everything
about
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
nondistinct
bland
and
one
dimensional
at
its
best
you
get
a
hint
of
some
roasted
barley
and
some
cherry
syrup
bleh
it
stays
this
way
for
a
while
as
it
warms
once
it
reaches
a
set
temperature
it
seems
to
then
come
alive
roasted
barley
and
dark
fruits
come
out
to
play
and
start
to
show
themselves
there
is
maybe
a
tease
of
some
chocolate
alongside
some
alcohol
hiding
behind
everything
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
balance
i
prefer
more
chocolate
and
coffee
in
my
oatmeal
stouts
much
less
to
none
dark
fruits
but
still
so
much
better
than
it
was
when
it
first
came
out
of
that
fridge
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
range
of
things
with
a
nice
silky
texture
courtesy
of
the
oats
feels
like
its
a
touch
watery
in
feel
but
just
a
touch
overall
this
one
did
not
live
up
to
my
hopes
for
it
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
when
i
found
it
in
my
store
actually
hoped
it
could
become
a
standby
beer
for
me
this
winter
as
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
and
am
in
the
hunt
for
a
new
solid
sixer
of
the
style
but
alas
it
is
not
to
be
simply
another
one
to
put
on
the
list
of
trieds
o
pretty
solid
beer
by
alaskan
but
its
pretty
evident
that
this
is
a
beer
made
to
appease
their
large
nationwide
market
rather
than
to
create
a
monumental
beast
of
a
beer
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that
obviously
a
solid
session
stout
o
its
not
stellar
but
its
a
really
nice
drinking
brew

a

a

for

d
tastes
like
a

light
and
very
easy

o
this
is
great
probably
my
new
favorite
stout
for
sure
in
my
week
long
trip
i
think
i
had
at

three
or
four
pitchers
of
the
stuff
it
was
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
too
easy
to
drink
great
brew

to
pick
up
another
sixer
when
i
see
it
sort
of
a
milder
more
traditional
oatmeal
stout
other
than
the
odd
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
a
worthwhile
stout
o
a
very
average
oatmeal
stout
it
almost
actally
tastes
a
bit
like
a
milk
stout
at
first
but
halfway
through
tasting
it
the
oat
flavors
definitely
come
into
play
and
let
you
know
that
they
are
there
a
nice
solid
beer
conclusion
this
is
a
fine
oatmeal
stout
and
one
that
wouldnt
turn
down
on
any
occasion
the
flavors
are
nice
and
they
mesh
well
but
overall
it
lacks
the
silky
richness
of
the
best
in
this
style
not
that
i
could
brew
better
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
covered
by
dark
brown
foam
decent
head
retention
with
a
bit
of
lacing
malty
aromas
of
roast
and
toffee
coffee
nuts
medium
bitterness
with
sweet
maltiness
and
roast
for
balance
mild
leafy
hops
chocolate
caramel
and
molasses
and
a
definite
oatiness
smooth
texture
fully
with
lowish
carbonation
nicely
balanced
and
a
rich
enjoyable
stout
a
good
easy
drinking
relatively
simple
stout
the
drinkability
is
great
for
an
oatmeal
a
great
6er
to
share
but
otherwise
an
agreeable
stout
lots
going
on
but
at
the
same
time
approachable
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
whole
sixpack
session
but
no
shame
in
saving
a
few
for
next
time
overall
a
very
satisfying
oatmeal
stout
simple
and
successful
has
just
about
everything
i
look
for
in
the
style
medium
body
a
bit
higher
carbonation
slightly
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
drinks
pretty
nice
very
inviting
nose
something
id
drink
again
if
it
were
available
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
with
proper
carbonation
easy
to
drink
paired
nicely
with
smoke
salmon
i
will
buy
this
when
it
shows
up
in
minnesota
i
have
always
liked
a
good
oatmeal
stout
t
pretty
big
and
bitter
i
like
it
lots
of
roasted
and
charred
malts
with
a
big
acidic
and
bitter
finish
this
was
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
alaskan
smooth
brew
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
full
body
each
silky
sip
of
beer
easily
goes
down
and
satisfies
that
dark
beer
craving
we
all
get
from
time
to
time
another
fine
brew
from
alaskan
brewing
co
a
quality
brew
not
to
to
diminish
its
quality
but
it
is
also
very
pedestrian
and
accessible
overall
this
was
very
solid
and
very
serviceable
really
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
easily
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
had
from
them
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
o
this
is
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
appearance
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
and
minimal
lace
smell
has
dark
roasted
malts
and
faint
dark
fruits
in
the
back
taste
of
rich
sweet
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
and
having
mellow
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
viscous
medium
with
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
stout
maybe
a
little
roasty
and
a
tad
watered
down
for
me
pours
a
black
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
oatmeal
slight
roasted
malt
hops
and
hint
of
coffee
fits
the
style
of
an
oatmeal
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
slight
earthy
malt
hint
of
hop
and
hint
of
coffee
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
m
d
very
smooth
a
little
creamy
the
oatmeal
great
balance
between
the
sweet
the
creamy
the
roast
the
hops
good
general
stout
might
have
to
buy
another
bottle
in
a
while
and
see
if
this
experience
was
normal
drinkability
isnt
bad
not
quite
the
oatmeal
stout
taste
i
was
hoping
for
but
easily
the
best
alaskan
ive
had
yet
this
beer
was
just
ok
for
me
i
want
my
stouts
to
be
smooth
and
malty
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
place
for
hops
in
a
stout
and
in
this
beer
there
was
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
front
end
you
get
malts
and
a
tiny
bit
of
oatmeal
but
the
malt
flavor
and
the
whole
complexity
arent
anything
special
its
just
ok
then
on
the
back
end
you
get
a
little
hop
bite
and
that
just
wasnt
that
good
for
me
nothing
horrible
about
this
beer
just
nothing
that
great
its
ok
d
overall
this
is
a
good
enjoyable
stout
it
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
to
get
sometime
to
try
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
id
have
to
track
down
again
the
look
could
use
a
bit
of
improvement
such
as
a
more
persistent
and
attractive
head
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
just
fine
for
the
style
thanks
again
akbeerfiend
d
pretty
solid
and
easy
to
drink
overall
the
stout
is
ok
but
one
i
dont
see
myself
buying
fairly
light
stout
thats
tasty
and
easydrinking
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
oatmeal
stout
as
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
alaskan
this
beer
is
a
worthy
purchase
and
the
quality
to
price
ratio
for
this
type
of
beer
is
outstanding
worth
keeping
around
so
you
can
enjoy
a
decent
stout
at
an
excellent
price
this
is
a
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
the
stout
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
the
head
quickly
resides
but
seems
to
want
to
stick
around
smells
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
aromas
carry
through
on
the
palate
mixed
in
with
sweet
oatmeal
the
carbonation
is
surprisingly
high
which
gives
it
a
lighter
body
feel
a
good
stout
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
very
dark
and
opaque
rubybla
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
smelled
of
dark
malts
primarily
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
similar
taste
to
the
smell
with
the
coffee
bitterness
being
a
little
more
prevalent
feel
is
somewhat
oily
with
a
full
body
and
a
light
tight
carbonation
overall
a
good
stout
and
very
drinkable
d
a
beer
that
is
probably
my
favourite
from
alaskan
maybe
even
over
the
much
heralded
smoked
porter
not
yet
in
the
class
of
the
classic
sam
smiths
but
this
is
a
delicious
stout
under
8
a
sixer
a
buy
is
a
no
brainer
for
this
quality
i
dont
know
why
ive
never
reviewed
this
perhaps
its
the
fact
that
its
simply
not
available
anywhere
as
a
single
bought
a
6er
on
the
cheap
tonight
and
im
glad
i
did
drinkability
the
appearance
and
nose
are
more
impressive
than
the
taste
not
bad
for
a
stout
a
tad
bitter
and
light
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
its
a
tough
style
to
go
up
against
as
there
are
so
many
that
surpass
known
benchmark
beers
regardless
any
true
stout
lover
shouldnt
dismiss
a
chance
to
try
it
d
probably
this
beers
shinning
characteristic
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
d
this
is
a
great
representation
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
it
features
a
great
aroma
i
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
to
have
a
little
more
body
and
to
pack
a
little
more
punch
in
the
flavor
department
but
otherwise

d
just
an
easy
drinking
well
made
oatmeal
stout
love
the
style
and
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
complex
version
cheers
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
not
top
tier
for
me
in
the
style
im
going
to
get
another
to
resample
it
but
for
now
its
good
but
not
great
do
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
rotation
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
from
co
need
to
resample
before
deciding
on
how
often
id
want
it
rsrs
thanks
jh1982
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
a
nice
solid
stout
id
have
a
couple
of
these
with
a
hearty
meal
this
beer
makes
me
excited
for
the
alaskan
smoked
porter
alaskans
most
coveted
beer
ive
passed
it
up
so
many
times
time
to
get
it
now
d
its
a
beer
to
enjoy
so
i
was
in
no
rush
to
slam
it
down
it
finishes
pretty
well
and
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
overall
d
this
is
certainly
a
different
sort
of
stout
the
intense
sweetness
really
took
me
back
im
almost
wondering
if
this
was
an
off
batch
as
my
beer
seemed
to
fall
way
outside
the
style
guidelines
an
enjoyable
and
odd
change
of
pace
good
brew
could
use
a
bit
more
body
as
mentioned
but
overall
a
nice
stout
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
not
bad
i
just
wasnt
all
that
into
this
one
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
stout
with
a
dominant
sweetness
and
a
nice
roasted
malt
backbone
solid
effort
from
alaskan
as
for
drinking
it
again
i
most
definitely
will
i
cant
say
that
this
beer
is
largely
drinkable
as
i
dont
really
enjoy
it
so
much
its
not
overly
alcoholic
but
its
sweet
transition
into
alcohol
just
simply
turns
me
off
i
can
see
how
some
may
enjoy
it
but
its
just
not
for
me
black
and
cola
like
in
color
only
much
more
opaque
than
a
cola
would
be
virtually
no
head
and
very
still
lightly
roasted
malt
nose
is
the
highlight
for
me
clean
and
easy
at
the
start
then
there
is
a
dose
of
heavy
smoke
flavor
that
resonates
as
the
flavor
dries
in
the
mouth
and
leads
you
to
the
finish
the
aftertaste
continues
to
be
smoky
its
like
taking
a
deep
whiff
of
a
smoldering
campfire
for
some
reason
i
like
smoke
in
my
beer
but
this
one
was
a
little
much
for
me
for
some
reason
d
not
bad
apparently
alaskan
brewed
with
an
safale
yeast
strain
us04
because
i
get
the
same
esters
when
i
brew
a
dark
ale
would
recommend
going
with
a
different
strain
to
get
rid
of
that
nasty
cherry
flavor
it
does
wonders
glad
i
got
to
try
this
as
its
another
offering
from
alaskan
that
i
had
yet
to
try
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
in
the
world
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
and
one
that
i
will
strive
to
have
on
tap
should
that
trip
to
ak
ever
happen
12

thanks
to
my
wife
for
picking
this
up
for
me
a
nice
pour
solid
black
brew
with
a
tan
head
some
coffee
notes
dark
malts
and
a
hint
of
bakers
chocolate
a
slight
sour
residual
note
takes
this
down
a
notch
or
two
glad
to
have
tried
this
d
this
is
a
great
showing
by
the
alaskan
brewing
company
i
can
see
this
one
being
a
regular
purchase
for
trustworthy
satisfaction
flavors
nice
not
a
bad
stout
from
alaskan
brewing
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
has
sweet
oats
roasted
malts
and
light
hops
the
taste
also
has
a
nice
oaty
presence
medium
body
drinks
well
nothing
special
but
a
good
ale
to
wash
down
some
pub
food
from
your
local
watering
hole
solid
all
around
stout
here
with
some
nice
full
flavors
and
a
toasty
warm
feel
to
it
the
combo
of
the
flavors
and
a
heftier
feel
are
keeping
the
drinkibility
back
for
me
a
bit
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
bottle
thanks
a
lot
for
this
one
kev
d
i
always
find
both
oatmeal
and
milk
stouts
far
more
drinkable
than
the
standard
variety
although
not
as
drinkable
as
nitrocanned
irish
dry
stouts
and
this
doesnt
fail
to
live
up
to
that
standard
probably
this
beers
shinning
characteristic
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
drinkability
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
imo
heavier
than
most
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
definitely
enjoy
the
taste
a
bit
thin
of
a
mouthfeel
my
bottle
had
a
green
label
that
claimed
to
be
an
oatmeal
stout
anyway
this
was
a
nice
little
beer
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
oaty
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
very
smooth
roasted
malts
oats
and
chocoloate
dominate
but
there
is
a
coffee
bite
near
the
end
a
bit
thin
but
a
very
good
beer
sample
at
the
super
terrific
stout
tasting
on
021608
this
brew
is
a
brownishblack
color
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
that
diminishes
steadily
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
toasted
grain
and
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
coffee
medium
smooth
body
with
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
flavors
the
finish
is
creamy
and
sweet
with
malt
and
light
hops
and
a
bit
of
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
above
average
although
if
alaskan
applied
some
of
their
smoked
porter
prowess
to
this
beer
it
would
be
a
lot
better
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
would
like
more
depth
here
though
a
good
silky
note
but
some
lighter
slick
notes
as
well
that
i
associate
with
diactyl
overall
i
would
like
the
roast
to
back
off
a
bit
and
some
minor
yeast
notes
but
still
easy
drinking
notes
from
053104
thanks
again
for
this
treat
bill
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
d
nice
stout
not
too
strong
of
a
taste
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
it
would
be
easy
to
down
one
and
start
another
is
a
bit
heavy
being
a
stout
and
all
but
is
very
nice
as
an
after
meal
beer
im
torn
a
bit
on
this
brew
i
like
the
straightforward
flavors
and
its
smooth
pleasing
nature
low
abv
and
lighter
body
make
this
quite
the
session
stout
if
youre
inclined
it
strikes
me
that
maybe
alaskan
is
going
for
an
english
interpretation
for
this
beer
they
do
that
well
give
this
beer
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
priced
reasonably
i
found
a
sixer
for
seven
bucks
or
so
not
bad
but
ill
definitely
reach
for
deschutes
obsidian
most
times
before
this
drinkability
decent
but
there
are
some
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
worth
giving
this
a
try
d
fairly
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
all
night
medium
body
light
effervescence
fairly
smooth
nice
mellow
aftertaste
with
notes
of
vanilla
malt
all
said
a
good
but
not
great
beer
overall
a
good
but
not
great
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
exactly
go
about
touting
its
virtues
to
everyone
that
will
listen
worth
trying
it
yourself
but
not
at
hte
cost
of
going
exceptionally
far
out
of
your
way
poured
a
blackish
color
decent
carbonation
basically
no
head
just
a
small
ring
of
tan
foam
nose
was
caramel
and
roasty
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
caramel
like
chocolate
notes
in
there
too
the
finish
has
a
bite
to
it
that
i
was
not
expecting
overall
it
is
an
average
stout
a
decent
brew
its
not
too
heavy
which
ups
its
drinkablity
and
has
a
decent
mixture
of
flavors
p
s
the
car
bomb
fancier
thought
it
was
better
than
guinness
pours
black
with
a
lasting
light
tan
head
smell
is
unique
but
with
some
thin
chocolate
and
some
sort
of
creamy
greenness
to
it
like
an
unripe
banana
taste
is
very
lightly
roasted
thin
malt
and
some
metallic
notes
and
an
odd
green
tartness
mouthfeel
is
lacking
and
is
too
thin
as
is
the
flavor
just
a
very
strange
beer
overall
feels
a
bit
thin
but
it
goes
down
easy
somewhat
subtle
but
plenty
enjoyable
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
faint
coffee
the
taste
is
deep
roasted
malts
with
coffee
and
some
bitter
chocolate
it
it
smoothed
out
by
the
oats
in
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
im
pretty
fond
of
this
alaskan
offering
as
its
a
smooth
drinker
quite
sessionable
and
most
importantly
has
enough
taste
to
keep
me
interested
the
only
problem
i
have
in
casper
is
that
the
retailers
sometimes
over
stock
it
and
you
dont
always
find
fresh
product
the
one
i
have
is
best
by
052508
and
its
tasting
good
super
drinkabiltiy
could
put
away
at
least
3
or
4
before
i
was
itching
to
move
on
good
solid
stout
that
lacks
some
niceties
an
all
right
beer
and
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
just
not
the
best
of
the
style
the
oats
make
for
some
smoothness
on
the
palate
but
overcarbonation
makes
this
beer
hard
to
drink
or
enjoy
unless
youre
really
into
burping
drinkability
great
session
stout
here
still
though
it
is
very
drinkable
and
one
does
not
grow
tired
of
it

i
would

then
4

which
im
not

its

im
saying
good
better
than

just
not
super
outstanding
a
b
student
pours
jet
black
as
a
stout
should
with
a
brown
head
it
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
of
the
stout
spectrium
smells
nice
but
ill
say
again
my
sense
of
smell
may
be
going
the
taste
is
what
i
expect
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
no
more
than
that
mouthfeel
it
light
for
a
stout
of
the
oatmeal
persuasion
and
it
goes
down
super
easy
for
a
stout
also
makes
a
good
sub
for
guinness
in
a
carbomb
this
is
an
average
american
oatmeal
stout
it
is
a
little
watery
for
what
i
would
prefer
but
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
in
america
it
pours
try
and
guess
jet
black
the
nose
does
tint
to
the
oatmeal
at
first
sip
it
feels
like
a
milk
stout
but
quickly
reminds
you
that
there
are
grains
involved
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
but
still
quite
thin
in
texture
good
for
beginners
a
nice
stout
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
is
a
mellow
dark
roasted
grains
which
if
folllowed
by
a
slightly
creamy
chocolate
oatmeal
aftertaste
the
aroma
is
of
sharper
bitter
black
grains
i
very
easy
and
approachable
stout
but
not
the
richest
in
flavor
still
very
tasty
and
worth
trying
if
youre
into
oatmeal
stouts
while
the
flavor
is
smaller
its
extra
drinkable
for
the
style
drinkability
very
nice
sessionable
stout
plenty
of
character
but
not
very
heavy

a
good

enjoyable
wish
i
had
more
poured
black
with
a
healthy
white
head
that
sticks
around

poured
with

a
deep
darkbrown

that
would
not
allow
any
sunlight
to
penetrate
it
the
nose
was
rich
with
chocolate
coffee
and
smoky
notes
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
veritable
explosion
of
flavors
on
the
tongue
i
got
dark
chocolate
darkroasted
coffee
and
more
of
the
charcoal
smokiness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
molasseslike
bittersweetness
to
it
a
really
good
oatmeal
stout
imho
as
you
could
expect
its
opaque
in
color
with
a
decent
little
head
but
the
retention
is
a
little
substandard
it
has
a
really
nice
sweet
smell
to
it
of
cocoa
and
oatmeal
with
a
subtle
burst
of
burnt
malts

i
was
quite
dissappointed
in
this
beer
it
was
a
bit
weak
overall
compared
with
other
oatmeal
stouts
it
seem
to
lack
the
chewiness
and
graininess
that
they
shuld
have
the
head
was
nonexistent
while
the
beer
itself
had
a
nice
toffee
colored
appearance
the
flavor
was
primarily
malt
and
toffee
and
was
a
bit
sweet
and
not
as
creamy
as
i
anticipated
i
think
that
it
may
be
a
bit
overcarbonated
for
an
oatmeal
stout
i
had
a
hard
time
distinguishing
any
aromas
from
this
beer
but
could
detect
a
bit
of
malt
with
some
effort
d
sooo
smooth
and
wonderful

everything

with
this
one
i
think
they
played
it
a
bit
too
safe

maybe
that
was
the
plan
with
this
one
basically
its
a
stout

there
are
many
other

better
to
me
out
there
the
smell
is
nice

strong
with
plenty
of
roasted

some
oatmeal

roasted

dominates
the
taste
up

while
oatmeal
and
hops
come
through

in

its
fairly
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
di
could
have
another
the
creamy
smooth
body
is
hindered
a
bit
by
the
cutting
sour
dry
finish
pretty
well
wipes
the
beer
from
the
palette
which
i
consider
unfortunate
as
i
like
roasty
stouts
to
linger
carbonation
is
moderate
about
right
for
the
style
thank
you
mom
and
dad
for
bringing
this
back
from
your
trip
to
alaska
for
me
this
is
across
the
board
a
beer
without
faults
nice
toasted
malt
with
a
very
slight
caramel
sweetness
to
it
but
not
overbearing
or
cloying
its
a
stout
i
could
drink
over
and
over
because
despite
the
fullneess
of
the
beer
it
does
drink
fairly
clean
and
not
overly
heavy

pours
a
deep
black
with

brown

nice
roasty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
full
of
toasted
malts
and
a
good
amount
of
dark
chocolate
a
little
roasted
coffee
too
just
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
fruit
lighter
bodied
than
expected
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
glad
we
brought
this
back
from
our
trip
to
alaska
i
could
drink
this
brew
all
night
very
nice
pleasing
body
and
very
drinkable
not
too
strong
if
youre
having
more
than
one
taste
and
mouthfeel
smooth
and
fullbodied
seems
to
get
thicker
as
it
warms
but
at
times
feels
almost
watery
due
to
the
smoothness
like
the
smell
the
flavors
in
the
taste
are
many
and
complex
but
not
as
bold
as
id
like
them
to
be
roasted
barely
up
front
followed
by
fruity
esters
that
mingle
with
coffee
notes
faint
hop
oils
orange
peels
smoke
and
chocolate
pour
appears
thick
and
color
is
a
very
deep
black
no
real
had
to
speak
of
just
a
nice
tan
crust
aroma
of
mild
smoke
coffee
faint
fruit
notes
of
licorice
and
cherry
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
sweetness
tastes
clean
for
a
stout
mildly
toasty
not
particularly
sweet
just
faintly
bitter
dark
malt
needs
more
strength
and
complexity
from
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
has
a
slight
thickness
but
its
perhaps
a
bit
light
for
a
stout
carbonation
is
decent
i
wasnt
very
impressed
by
this
one
although
being
lighter
and
smooth
than
most
stouts
and
also
less
alcoholic
it
is
still
an
easy
drinker
i
like
more
flavor
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
real
mild
oatmeal
stout
this
would
be
suitable
this
stout
definitely
seems
to
need
a
bit
more
malt
and
body
to
it
the
roast
character
is
just
a
bit
too
strong
having
said
that
this
definitely
appeals
to
the
side
of
me
that
likes
a
thick
black
strong
cup
of
joe
in
the
morning
the
oats
add
just
a
touch
of
body
to
this
brew
which
certainly
helps
out
i
am
sampling
at
room
temp
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
2
cm
spongy
and
creamy
tan
head
foaming
up
easily
the
head
fades
slowly
to
a
sturdy
edge
layer
and
a
bit
of
a
thin
surface
presence
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
some
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
coffee
too
sort
of
like
a
ultra
lite
and
sweet
mocha
the
first
sip
reveals
a
fairly
thick
body
and
mild
carbonation
there
is
a
smooth
coating
across
my
palate
as
the
beer
rolls
towards
my
belly
the
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
overall
with
some
brown
sugar
slight
oat
flakey
flavor
with
molasses
and
chocolate
there
are
no
hops
that
i
detect
nor
any
presence
of
alcohol
the
beer
is
a
real
easy
drinker
and
finishes
roasted
and
molasses
that
lingers
quite
a
nice
brew
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
and
i
will
not
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
this
beer
has
absolutely
nothing
on
the
ak
smoked
porter
deep
black
body
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
retained
well
not
much
lace
surprisingly
subtle
sweet
aroma
was
followed
by
a
silky
smooth
sweetish
and
slightly
roasted
taste
not
as
roasty
as
other
oatmeal
stouts
but
very
nice
drinkable
another
fine
beer
from
this
sleeper
and
in
my
opinion
giant
of
the
american
craft
breweing
scene
go
alaskan
amazing
how
flavorful
a
stout
oatmeal
with
only
4
55
abv
can
be
produced
and
consumed
like
a
session
beer
for
the
price
there
are
better
stouts
with
more
abv
however
if
appropriately
priced
this
is
good
not
a
significant
portion
of
chocolate
or
coffee
however
this
is
session
stuff
not
to
suggest
the
aforementioned
can
not
be
apart
of
session
beer
the
beer
is
gone
empty
very
smooth
and
fresh
to
the
finish
note
as
of
905
this
beer
is
still
listed
as
4
55
abv
its
actually
4
55
abw
drinkability
not
bad
but
the
mouthfeel
brings
the
beer
down
doesnt
have
that
lip
smacking
thickness
you
like
in
a
good
stout
still
worthy
of
a
try
though
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
the
head
fades
quickly
leaving
minimal
laces
it
smells
malty
it
has
hints
of
coffee
not
much
to
the
aroma
maybe
just
a
slight
caramel
aroma
pretty
week
it
tastes
slightly
of
coffee
it
is
sweet
the
roasted
malts
are
detectable
but
only
slightly
i
cant
really
say
much
more
about
the
flavor
it
is
sort
of
dry
it
is
very
mild
also
it
is
carbonated
well
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
leaving
a
slightly
malty
sweet
taste
on
the
palate
this
beer
might
be
a
decent
session
beer
because
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
it
is
very
non
aggressive
if
you
are
looking
for
an
oatmeal
stout
you
should
probably
try
something
else
this
beer
is
not
really
worth
your
time
or
money
if
you
just
want
something
to
drink
all
night
and
want
to
drink
something
decent
this
beer
is
for
you

over
all
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
great
for
a
session
beer
hopefully
itll
be
more
available
around
philadelphia
soon
a
sweet
stout
if
there
was
ever
one
a
milky
chocolatey
sessional
which
should
come
directly
after
guinness
for
converting
a
macrolover
to
a
stoutheart
it
pours
remarkably
black
almost
an
absence
of
light
rather
than
a
real
color
but
some
chocolate
brown
edges
can
be
seen
the
head
rises
fully
but
quickly
dwindles
to
a
small
lid
of
lace
the
aroma
is
relatively
mild
with
the
possibility
of
a
chocolate
bar
dipped
in
guinness
flavorwise
the
taste
has
lots
of
roastiness
tons
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
coffee
more
than
a
little
buttery
caramel
and
literally
scads
of
sugar
its
a
remarkably
sweet
stout
and
it
could
also
be
called
a
milk
stout
or
a
a
cream
stout
alaskan
chooses
to
call
it
an
oatmeal
stout
i
never
understood
the
difference
between
stouts
anyway
it
aint
an
imperial
thats
all
i
can
say
suitable
for
a
toothsomely
sweet
session
or
to
be
paired
with
dessert
or
shellfish
i
can
understand
why
seasoned
stoutlovers
arent
enamoured
with
this
but
i
really
liked
it
and
i
think
its
a
perfect
choice
for
a
first
time
stout
drinker
its
sweet
which
is
a
plus
its
not
too
thick
and
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
hops
so
that
a
newbie
can
understand
and
appreciate
the
sweet
roasty
flavor
of
the
blacker
malts
basically
black
in
hue
especially
in
the
middle
around
the
edges
is
some
ruby
highlights
most
noticed
when
backlight
the
head
was
beige
in
color
tightly
compacted
bubbles
created
a
thin
head
less
than
a
half
finger
in
height
however
there
was
great
staying
power
in
fact
it
just
sat
there
a
long
while
before
turn
soapy
the
subsequent
lacing
was
very
spotty
and
quite
minimal
it
looks
great
the
nose
is
not
impressive
at
all
there
is
little
depth
the
malt
is
onedimensional
and
there
sure
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
oat
sweetness
ordinary
roast
with
a
kiss
of
espresso
i
even
get
a
kiss
of
minty
milk
odd
the
potency
is
low
but
it
is
not
saying
much
anyway
overall
the
nose
is
very
ordinary
it
is
too
apathetic
to
be
considered
inviting
the
palate
is
just
as
damn
lackluster
as
the
nose
leads
me
to
believe
it
is
sweeter
more
milky
then
oaty
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
suppose
weak
acidity
from
the
roast
hints
of
espresso
the
hops
fail
to
say
much
and
it
adds
hardly
any
bitterness
the
taste
is
simplistic
but
flavorsome
in
a
singleminded
manner
it
has
a
messy
finish
with
lots
of
disjointed
sweetness
and
some
stray
roasted
notes
this
is
yet
another
weak
tasting
offering
from
alaskan
yawn
there
are
a
lot
of
things
about
this
oatmeal
stout
that
reminds
me
of
big
skys
offering
this
one
is
a
little
better
but
not
much
light
in
body
slick
on
the
tongue
from
the
low
carbonation
there
isnt
much
i
like
about
the
mouthfeel
it
is
almost
slimy
the
one
bottle
i
have
is
enough
for
me
this
beer
is
a
dud
there
is
no
other
way
to
say
that
i
dont
care
for
it
and
thus
it
is
not
that
drinkable
sure
it
is
easy
to
knock
back
but
pointless
to
do
so
i
am
very
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
it
is
forgettable
i
purchased
a
12ounce
bottle
online
from
liquid
solutions
alaskan
stout
is
a
pleasant
surprise
itll
never
be
mistaken
for
big
beer
but
then
thats
true
of
most
oatmeal
stouts
that
ive
run
across
speaking
of
oatmeal
stouts
this
excellent
alaskan
brewing
company
offering
can
go
toetotoe
with
the
best
of
the
style
and
not
flinch
its
that
good
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
black
malt
scent
with
a
dry
oatmeal
feel
it
boasts
of
chocolate
patent
and
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
but
rich
black
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
earthy
the
taste
is
not
all
that
great
it
seems
a
bit
top
heavy
with
black
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
would
be
better
served
having
less
carbonation
it
also
hurts
the
drinkability
this
is
an
average
stout
i
like
the
complexity
but
the
mouthfeel
and
grain
bill
need
tweeking
great
drinkibility
this
one
surprised
me
nice
solid
beer
no
head
whatsoever
on
the
pour
wtf
its
an
opaque
charcoal
black
color
smell
is
a
bit
odd
really
roasted
almost
acidic
then
it
turns
into
a
sour
fruit
flavor
the
taste
has
those
characteristics
but
to
a
lesser
degree
this
is
a
really
balanced
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
and
black
strap
molasses
taste
combined
with
an
earthy
bitterness
finishes
roasted
and
with
a
bit
of
oatmeal
flavor
in
it
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
you
that
this
was
an
oatmeal
stout
without
knowing
it
beforehand
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
nothing
too
inspiring
however
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
and
it
will
certainly
do
in
a
pinch
a
very
traditional
oatmeal
stout
not
as
much
astringency
in
the
finish
as
most
people
who
dont
usually
like
stouts
should
like
this
one
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
stronger
flavor
but
is
a
good
session
beer
poured
a
pitch
almost
coca
cola
black
with
a
rather
small
tan
mocha
head
that
vanishes
into
the
black
hole
rather
quickly
the
smell
was
a
strong
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
beans
a
little
lighter
roast
smells
than
most
stouts
hint
of
cocao
and
tapioca
taste
is
lighter
almost
porter
like
roasted
malt
sweetness
is
the
main
taste
followed
by
mild
bitterness
grilled
fruit
mixed
with
caramel
toppings
was
a
pleasant
suprise
to
find
mixed
with
the
light
roasted
malts
a
drinkable
stout
above
average
but
to
many
top
notch
stouts
out
there
to
give
this
another
shot
overall
impression
a
wonderful
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
satisfying
at
the
same
time
dark
in
color
light
in
taste
classic
stout
carbonation
is
a
touch
low
but
i
think
it
actually
helps
drinkability
id
down
two
or
three
of
these
on
a
hot
alaskan
day
did
i
just
say
that
recommended
notes
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
that
i
didnt
regret
giving
a
try
but
its
not
really
one
that
ill
seek
out
in
the
future
its
a
tad
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
style
and
understated
yet
still
complex
as
a
stout
should
be
cheers
thanks
again
to
alexgash
and
idaho
looks
like
a
great
stout
deep
black
dark
dan
head
not
as
much
head
as
others
smell
is
amazing
a
calorific
burst
of
roasted
grains
chocolate
and
an
intense
aroma
of
marshmallows
yep
it
must
be
marshmallow
tste
is
smooth
and
delectible
with
the
hops
hidden
but
allowed
to
speak
in
whispers
full
body
and
very
drinkable
again
a
beer
that
i
would
like
to
see
on
the
east
coast
it
is
opaque
black
in
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
smells
of
roasted
coffee
the
body
is
smooth
from
the
addition
of
the
oats
it
is
fairly
complex
with
tastes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
fuit
it
finishes
with
a
roasty
bitterness
a
very
good
beer
for
the
stout
lovers

sour
with

smoky
chocolate
bitter
after
a
decent
stout
i
picked
this
beer
up
in
a
natural
food
store
this
oatmeal
stout
was
a
rich
dark
brown
color
in
the
clear
former
jelly
jar
that
was
my
mug
for
the
evening
there
was
a
short
lived
light
coffee
colored
head
there
was
just
a
little
lace
it
was
aromatic
with
elements
of
hop
bouquet
toasted
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
now
on
to
the
taste
the
overall
taste
was
smooth
with
a
bit
going
on
toasted
chocolate
coffee
and
traces
of
caramel
there
was
some
hop
bite
and
some
nice
flavoring
hops
that
balanced
out
the
malt
the
finish
was
dry
and
bittersweet
while
i
found
this
stout
to
be
good
it
was
just
a
bit
too
mellow
for
me
the
word
mellow
is
circled
in
my
original
notes
i
think
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
hopped
for
a
sharper
edge
but
thats
just
my
tastes
thanks
and
cheers
to
genaro
very
dark
but
not
truly
black
the
head
is
light
tan
but
weak
and
it
fades
quickly
chocolate
malt
and
fruit
are
gentle
on
the
nose
while
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
roast
malt
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
the
candied
dates
fade
from
the
palate
a
bitterness
that
almost
seems
out
of
place
after
the
softness
of
the
rest
of
the
flavors
fades
lingers
on
for
a
bit
pours
very
dark
hazel
nearly
black
with
a
tan
foamy
head
smells
of
roasted
coffee
but
smell
overall
is
faint
taste
is
acidic
and
fritysour
i
generally
dont
like
this
taste
over
a
roasted
malt
and
this
is
no
exception
acdity
is
not
good
for
stouts
it
just
doesnt
fit
it
detracts
from
the
other
flavors
overall
this
is
an
interesting
but
utterly
forgetable
brew
im
partial
to
this
style
and
this
version
grabbed
me
the
right
way
drinkability

i
dont
know
how
this
is
averaging
3
75
with
20
reviews
i
think
this
is
a
standout
as
i
said
its
not
a
big
fullbodied
imperial
stout
but
it
doesnt
claim
to
be
i
like
this
one
and
will
keep
it
on
hand
poured
a
deep
dark
blackish
brown
very
small
tan
head
that
disappeared
at
extremely
high
speed
scents
of
molasses
and
coffee
taste
was
disappointing
for
an
oatmeal
stout
as
it
was
rather
thin
not
very
complex
im
kinda
bummed
i
was
looking
forward
to
drinking
a
good
stout
source
liquid
solutions
overall
a
good
oatmeal
stout
an
opaque
black
body
reveals
ruby
highlights
at
the
base
of
the
glass
when
held
to
the
light
the
creamy
darktan
head
drops
shortly
but
maintains
a
decent
collar
and
some
whispy
surface
foam
throughout
the
glass
lacing
however
is
limited
mocha
greets
you
in
the
nose
through
the
combintion
of
a
creamycoffeelike
roastiness
and
the
cocoafruit
combination
of
a
chocolate
raisin
bar
the
fruitiness
is
intriguing
almost
cherrylike
and
the
chocolate
at
times
appears
a
bit
like
cocoanut
very
nice
the
body
is
light
but
the
very
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
leaves
it
lightly
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
smooth
in
the
swallow
at
first
the
rich
chocolatecoffeelike
maltiness
dominates
in
the
flavor
but
as
you
progress
the
almost
sourish
fruitiness
cherries
raisin
steps
into
first
place
the
roastiness
comes
up
midpalate
followed
by
a
gentle
caramel
sweetness
chocolate
and
a
splash
of
fruit
make
another
appearance
in
the
finish
but
are
short
lived
before
dryness
sets
in
its
very
well
balanced
with
an
underlying
bitterness
that
holds
everything
in
place
but
never
comes
forward
exceptionally
well
done
and
quite
enjoyable
totally
black
color
large
tan
head
aroma
is
chocolate
and
malts
a
medium
bodied
stout
lightly
roasted
malts
light
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
flavors
slightly
fruity
the
taste
improves
as
it
warms
kind
of
a
disappointing
beer
from
these
guy
expected
better
drinkable
but
there
are
lots
of
better
stouts
out
there
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
very
nice
stout
a
little
thicker
on
the
taste
departments
and
this
could
be
a
great
stout
a
very
milky
creamy
stout
to
say
the
least
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
and
subtle
hints
of
dark
chocolate
slightly
sour
and
milky
up
front
with
a
light
roasted
flavor
following
it
up
a
light
licorice
aftertaste
lingers
just
for
a
bit
its
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
i
think
could
be
better
if
it
packed
just
a
little
more
punch
as
dark
as
a
moonless
desert
night
the
head
is
quite
modest
in
size
the
texture
spumescent
light
chocolate
in
color
and
as
it
degrades
leaves
behind
a
fine
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
lightly
toasted
grains
sweet
and
malt
dominated
pleasant
enough
nose
start
sweet
and
malt
laden
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
pertinent
acidity
the
hops
understated
but
present
dry
aftertaste
id
classify
this
as
a
beginners
stout
and
that
is
meant
in
the
best
of
ways
just
not
overly
robust
which
would
turn
most
lager
lovers
off
a
good
start
on
your
way
to
being
converted
to
the
dark
side
black
in
color
with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
red
mixed
in
very
small
tan
lace
the
nose
is
rather
unspectacular
some
soft
roasted
grains
and
a
hint
of
molassis
maybe
i
love
the
creaminess
of
this
and
the
flavor
it
is
a
bit
thinnish
in
the
mouth
but
overall
a
very
good
mouthfeel
some
very
nice
roasted
andor
burnt
malt
notes
also
some
sweeter
chocolate
notes
along
with
some
molassisbrown
sugarmaple
syrupalong
those
lines
cant
quite
identify
and
it
is
subtle
also
some
hints
of
dark
fruits
pretty
complex
but
not
real
thick
overall
good
but
not
spectacular
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
very
creamy
but
not
real
heavy
this
beer
is
almost
opaque
very
little
head
forms
on
the
pour
very
little
carbonation
was
noted
when
the
bottle
cap
was
removed
a
thin
rimming
of
brown
is
all
that
is
there
nil
on
the
lacing
as
well
nice
roasted
bitterness
and
chocolate
blend
on
the
nose
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
is
low
on
carbonation
which
lends
to
a
nice
drinkability
factor
the
taste
is
fairly
empty
compared
to
what
ive
been
drinking
lately
the
bells
stouts
theres
a
slight
roasted
and
burnt
bitterness
some
shades
of
dark
fruits
this
is
better
than
average
but
lacks
the
assertive
notes
of
complexity
to
rate
it
any
higher
not
a
disappointment
by
any
means
just
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
given
the
quality
of
the
other
brews
ive
had
from
alaskan
183
had
a
fairly
fresh
bottle
of
this
when
i
poured
the
bottle
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
the
aroma
was
intoxicating
sweet
coffee
smells
were
flowing
freely
from
the
glass
the
beer
was
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
would
lead
but
still
a
very
nice
stout
thin
dark
brown
head
that
died
off
pretty
quickly
sweet
cofee
flavor
with
slight
burnt
character
not
overly
complex
but
nicely
drinkable
notes
hmm
a
very
nice
full
and
complex
stout
the
addition
of
oats
also
provides
a
unique
fullness
to
this
roasty
beer
most
definitely
worth
a
try
for
you
stout
lovers
out
there
very
smooth
with
great
look
great
taste
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
high
chance
of
me
getting
this
one
again
on
nitro
at
the
tap
bloomington
in
had
it
nitro
not
great
dark
brown
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
aroma
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasty
malt
taste
follows
with
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
slightly
thinner
than
i
prefer
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
great
beer
very
smooth
and
drinkable
extremely
pleasant
heavy
notes
of
oatmeal
and
malts
extremely
pleasant
in
appearance
head
clings
to
the
glass
making
for
a
very
appealing
flavor
and
look
notes
of
malts
and
oatmeal
are
outstanding
one
of
my
top
beers
personally
overall
this
draftonly
beer
from
summit
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
im
pleased
i
got
to
try
it
a
topnotch
lowabv
oatmeal
stout
smooth
flavorful
rich
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
o
superb
for
the
style
so
drinkable
with
the
abv
so
low
with
so
much
stout
flavor
love
this
brew
a
great
season
stout
with
an
amazing
smoothness
and
everything
you
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
o
i
was
wowd
by
this
beer
when
i
saw
it
on
tap
i
went
in
not
expecting
much
but
what
i
got
was
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
ever
had
o
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
while
proof
that
stout
doesnt
need
8
plus
abv
or
to
be
barreled
to
be
great
the
richness
of
the
coffee
and
sweets
balances
perfectly
with
the
bitterness
zesty
aftertaste
stays
with
you
one
summits
greats
this
is
a
real
treat
on
cask
i
have
had
it
via
nitro
and
that
is
like
every
other
nitro
beer
i
have
ever
had
meaning
it
kills
all
nuance
and
body
on
cask
this
is
very
nice
and
a
perfect
example
of
why
nitro
should
be
abolished
not
even
the
same
beer
highly
recommended
on
cask
served
this
oatmeal
stout
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
almost
black
produced
a
tan
average
head
retention
was
average
and
it
left
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
stout
consisted
of
roasted
grain
and
milk
chocolate
full
bodied
this
stout
is
smooth
creamy
slick
you
notice
the
mouthfeel
almost
before
you
taste
anything
roasted
grain
milk
chocolate
a
splash
of
coffee
complete
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
excellent
session
beer
very
nice
example
of
a
traditional
oatmeal
stout
final
thoughts
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
summit
its
also
one
of
the
hardest
to
get
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
or
porters
then
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
it
on
tap
what
a
creamy
delight
twss
i
had
this
on
tap
on
the
4th
of
july
and
the
hottest
day
of
the
year
despite
the
heat
i
really
liked
this
thick
rich
beer
it
poured
with
a
heavy
foam
into
a
dark
color
the
smell
was
pleasant
but
not
overwhelming
the
taste
was
all
stout
it
was
rich
creamy
and
flavorful
without
a
single
hint
of
alcohol
aftertaste
it
was
thick
and
filling
a
overall
my
buddies
and
i
tried
a
bar
in
st
paul
called
groveland
tap
and
i
was
particularly
excited
because
i
saw
it
had
this
beer
on
tap
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
in
some
time
i
will
recommend
it
without
hesitation
to
anyone
easy
drinker
excellent
stout
a
good
example
of
the
style
well
worth
checking
out
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
stout
it
tastes
great
and
feels
pretty
good
i
would
have
this
again
and
again
pours
a
deep
brown
black
with
a
dense
foamy
three
finger
khaki
head
very
mild
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
dark
roasted
chocolate
malt
oats
and
leather
pleasant
flavors
chocolate
bit
of
cocoa
mild
oatmeal
and
a
smidgen
of
smoke
rounds
out
the
dark
roasted
malt
backbone
fairly
dry
modestly
carbonated
creamy
and
smooth
solid
offering
from
summit
dr
incredibly
drinkable
uses
cream
to
overcome
stout
dryness
instead
of
succumbing
to
porteresque
workarounds
the
oat
smoothness
synergizes
brilliantly
with
the
nitrodraught
system
found
this
in
all
places
stone
city
ia
right
outside
anamosa
on
tap
was
pretty
excited
to
try
it
pours
a
dark
black
with
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
somewhat
faint
flavor
is
roasted
malts
coffee
dark
chocolate
very
smooth
and
an
awesome
creamy
texture
two
thumbs
up
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
definitely
not
a
favorite
still
good
and
fairly
drinkable
as
a
nightcap
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
brownish
black
a
bit
light
and
clear
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
a
creamy
tan
head
that
retained
and
laced
well
smell
of
roasty
malts
and
smoke
taste
was
very
dry
and
roasty
dark
malts
and
smokey
leather
with
a
beef
jerky
sensation
detectable
coffee
bitterness
in
the
finish
mediumbodied
and
fairly
drinkable
though
not
the
kind
of
stout
id
want
to
order
for
a
casual
session
overall
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
good
here
i
did
not
care
for
this
oatmeal
stout
much
maybe
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
on
nitro
tap
it
killed
the
flavors
but
i
found
it
pretty
weak
all
in
all
id
try
this
out
again
if
given
the
chance
i
had
this
beer
after
a
summit
brewery
tour
pours
great
with
a
great
head
taste
is
even
better
with
an
exceptional
finish
smell
is
different
than
most
stouts
because
of
the
oatmeal
hard
to
find
but
if
you
find
it
you
should
definitely
try
it
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
overall
a
very
solid
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
from
summit
great
for
when
you
want
a
dark
beer
with
a
lighter
body
or
something
that
goes
great
with
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
a
nice
low
abv
stout
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
i
hope
i
have
to
come
back
just
to
have
this
beer
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
it
i
really
like
this
stuff
and
it
makes
me
wonder
about
the
other
summit
offerings
overallone
of
my
favorites
from
summit
which
tends
to
go
a
little
heavy
on
the
bitter
hops
for
most
of
their
brews
do
pretty
easy
going
oatmeal
stout
may
become
slightly
bored
with
this
offering
after
a
pint
or
two
d
very
high
at
4
7
its
extemely
sessionable
and
a
great
winter
warmer
i
couldnt
wait
to
order
a
growler
of
this
draft
on
tap
at
town
hall
tap
on
nitro
super
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
tiny
bubbled
tan
head
roasted
malted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
notes
in
the
nose
nice
lace
on
the
glass
smooth
velvety
medium
mouthfeel
mmmm
only
nitro
can
be
this
smooth
very
smooth
flavor
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
notes
with
an
overall
nice
rounded
out
flavor
tasty
ends
fairly
dry
d
goes
down
so
smooth
it
is
almost
dangerous
great
at
any
time
of
day
from
morning
on
the
special
occasion
or
before
a
great
sporting
match
to
the
evening
only
drawback
is
availability
i
wish
i
could
have
a
pint
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
minnesota
night
but
absent
a
nitrotap
and
keg
fridge
i
will
have
to
save
it
for
special
occasions
on
tap
at
blue
door
pub
comes
to
the
table
a
gorgeous
deep
dark
broung
with
a
delicious
looking
cream
colored
head
smells
dark
and
roasty
like
a
good
stout
should
taste
is
on
par
with
the
style
not
better
than
others
but
very
good
solid
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
at
times
but
very
solid
very
drinkable
i
would
order
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
pint
at
gunflint
grand
marais
mn
d
nearly
chuggable
however
the
incredible
presence
of
oats
makes
the
beer
become
slightly
tedious
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
d
this
is
probably
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
very
good
taste
thats
very
easy
to
drink
worth
getting
if
you
see
it
on
tap
drinkable
d
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
again
poor
mouthfeel
and
taste
rates
it
low
on
this
particular
variable
flavor
is
also
a
bit
muted
with
creamy
oats
and
charred
chocolate
malts
leading
the
way
summits
oatmeal
stout
is
tasty
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
as
it
fell
a
bit
flat
in
the
middle
noticeable
blandness
towards
the
finish
but
thankfully
a
bit
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
picks
up
the
slack
great
mouthfeel
courtesy
of
our
friend
the
7th
atomic
element
smooth
chewy
slick
velvety
all
of
the
above
in
terms
of
body
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
but
i
would
choose
several
other
stouts
over
this
one
still
its
definitely
worth
a
try
i
love
this
beer
best
offering
from
summit
wish
more
places
had
it
on
tap
looks
like
espresso
during
the
first
second
of
the
pour
followed
by
the
nice
cascade
effect
from
the
nitrogen
and
just
under
two
fingers
worth
of
creamy
nitrohead
smell
is
very
similar
espresso
and
coffee
with
a
very
slight
sweetness
of
chocolate
first
taste
is
of
roasted
barley
finishing
with
a
malty
sweetness
full
bodied
and
lingers
for
little
while
after
its
gone
a
very
nice
alternate
to
guinness
for
desert
drinkablility
is
great
this
may
be
the
definition
of
a
session
stout
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
with
more
flavor
than
a
typical
nitro
beer
great
oatmeal
stout
overall
so
easy
to
drink
and
a
low
abv
to
boot
i
wish
some
way
some
how
summit
could
package
this
for
consumers
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
id
like
to
see
a
fuller
nonnitro
version
bottled
because
it
has
a
lot
of
upside
but
the
current
situation
is
akin
to
an
oated
guinness
good
session
stout
but
a
bit
hollow
pours
black
with
a
light
tan
head
that
cascades
in
the
body
of
the
beer
for
a
while
after
its
poured
aroma
was
of
roasted
malts
and
creaminess
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
super
silkysmooth
flavors
were
a
perfect
mix
of
roasted
toasted
malt
with
hints
of
cream
and
coffee
i
was
anticipating
that
this
would
be
good
and
it
exceeded
those
expecations
this
is
to
date
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
came
to
the
table
with
a
foamy
tan
2
finger
head
and
a
dark
black
color
with
streaks
of
red
when
held
to
the
light
the
taste
and
aroma
have
coffee
oatmeal
and
chocolate
smooth
and
creamy
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
fairly
light
nice
drinkability
with
a
mix
of
sweetness
and
coffee
bitterness
nicely
made
d
surprisingly
this
is
quite
drinkable
beer
for
me
at
least
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
summit
drinkability
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
and
just
enjoy
it
i
would
be
quite
content
drinking
this
on
a
late
fall
night
into
winter
served
in
a
tulip
glass
slightly
chilled
at
the
happy
gnome
in
st
paul
mn
on
cask
no
less
this
shows
a
deep
and
solid
brown
black
with
a
fair
fuzzy
light
brown
head
and
good
steady
lacing
the
aroma
brings
on
some
classic
coffee
vaguely
smokey
malt
chocolate
floats
around
as
usual
pretty
nice
overall
the
taste
offers
much
more
of
that
charcoal
smoke
with
sweet
apple
malt
and
more
subtle
coffee
hints
this
is
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
but
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
decent
liveliness
for
a
cask
but
midbodied
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
bit
more
than
most
cask
brews
not
knock
your
socks
off
great
but
a
solid
brew
very
much
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
upon
a
cask
like
i
did
tonight
on
tap
at
the
brewery
heavy
cascading
action
as
i
watch
being
drawn
off
the
tap
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
the
nose
is
mildly
malty
and
smells
almost
creamy
with
some
touches
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
consistent
with
the
nose
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
touch
of
smoke
flavoring
clean
finish
that
is
very
light
considering
all
that
is
going
on
the
rich
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
the
fullness
of
the
flavors
would
lead
me
to
expect
more
of
a
residual
aftertaste
it
stays
pretty
clean
and
the
creaminess
begs
to
be
sipped
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
except
the
burnt
flavor
easy
drinking
stout
i
could
easily
have
another
as
my
pint
is
going
fast
i
recommend
this
one
if
you
are
around
the
twin
cities
would
love
to
see
this
in
bottles
sometime
and
i
would
prefer
carbonation
in
the
bottle
rather
than
a
nitrowidget
this
would
produce
a
better
match
to
the
on
tap
mouthfeel
excellent
offering
from
summit
this
beer
is
definitely
the
sum
of
its
parts
quality
ingredients
quality
brewing
quality
beer
d
not
as
smoky
as
most
stouts
ive
tried
which
makes
it
very
easy
for
me
to
drink
i
think
i
may
have
a
new
favorite
dark
beer
d
very
good
pretty
decent
i
wish
it
wasnt
on
nitro
tap
it
prolly
woulda
had
more
flavor
d
highly
drinkable
and
every
sip
enjoyable
had
this
on
nitro
at
whistle
binkies
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
left
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
glass
very
nice
aroma
was
a
little
light
some
watered
down
roasty
malts
hints
of
chocolate
taste
was
very
nice
roasted
malts
were
in
good
supply
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
and
a
nice
creaminess
i
for
one
do
not
like
nitrotap
brews
while
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
spot
on
the
body
was
off
for
me
yes
it
was
creamy
but
it
was
definitely
missing
that
carbonation
bite
that
would
have
really
made
this
beer
sing
the
nitro
basically
ruined
this
for
me
and
made
a
good
beer
less
drinkable
it
just
seemed
like
flat
watery
beer
where
is
the
body
on
this
thick
tasting
brew
if
i
could
find
this
carbonated
with
co2
i
would
enjoy
it
much
more
the
taste
is
outstanding
smooth
rich
and
flavorful
lots
of
creamy
malty
goodness
the
beer
just
slides
down
the
throat
it
isnt
fizzy
like
some
stouts
ive
had
just
smooth
and
rich
at
4
8
with
smooth
and
easy
drinking
the
summit
oatmeal
presents
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
may
i
suggest
pairing
this
brew
with
a
signature
burger
at
stub
and
herb
in
mpls
of
course
sub
fries
with
the
10000
lakes
dressing
great
both
on
the
burger
and
with
the
fries
a
solid
choice
for
anyone
before
a
sporting
event
or
just
out
for
dinner
what
a
treat
fresh
stout
with
a
heady
aroma
damn
near
jet
black
in
the
glass
with
a
beautiful
creamy
head
lovely
smoky
oats
flavor
with
a
long
aftertaste
smooth
and
not
overwhelming
in
alcohol
this
is
one
beer
i
can
drink
all
evening
summits
masterpiece
on
tap
at
irish
fair
o8
nearly
jet
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
mild
earthy
roasty
aroma
that
gets
much
stronger
after
it
warms
up
a
bit
wonderfull
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
with
a
rather
sweet
finish
hops
are
there
for
balance
but
that
seems
to
be
it
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamyoats
this
is
a
smooth
stout
with
no
pretentions
just
drink
it
and
be
happy
first
off
this
was
slowly
and
properly
poured
at
stub
herbs
in
mpls
appearance
is
a
deep
jetblack
with
a
gorgeous
frothy
tan
head
that
you
could
float
a
quarter
on
aromas
of
roast
malt
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
are
everywhere
with
a
hint
of
grassy
english
hops
flavor
is
well
silky
smooth
and
oh
so
creamy
again
with
the
roast
malts
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
are
just
enough
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
creaminess
this
is
a
great
quaffing
beer
and
if
i
would
change
anything
it
would
be
to
allow
the
oats
to
come
through
a
bit
more
this
was
more
like
a
guinness
than
an
oatmeal
stout
but
an
awesome
stout
nonetheless
wonderful
rich
deep
brownblack
color
with
a
deep
tan
head
that
holds
up
throughout
and
leaves
nice
lacing
towards
the
end
nice
malt
smellhints
of
coffee
as
well
taste
had
a
very
rich
coffe
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
thick
in
the
mouth
rich
and
smooth
a
very
good
stout
da
solid
simple
brew
nothing
about
screams
out
but
nothing
detracts
either
good
plain
and
simple
drinkability
is
good
only
inhibited
by
the
mouthfeel
being
a
bit
heavier
overall
i
loved
this
brew
enough
so
in
fact
that
the
friends
and
i
will
be
making
weekly
trips
up
to
hudson
for
this
d
great
all
around
beer
im
very
impressed
by
this
one
and
would
definitely
enjoy
a
few
in
a
night
served
a
bit
cold
and
with
a
tall
head
but
once
it
warmed
up
and
settled
down
it
was
quite
nice
it
was
a
simple
smooth
oat
and
cocoa
with
coffeelike
roasted
grains
with
wonderfully
long
aftertaste
probably
still
my
favorite
summit
beer
and
a
very
worthy
session
beer
i
could
drink
many
of
these
as
they
are
extremely
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
jet
black
in
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
head
disappeared
very
quickly
which
was
disappointing
soft
roasty
aroma
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
lightly
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
not
much
sweetness
seems
to
lack
the
velvet
mouthfeel
and
silky
texture
of
a
great
oatmeal
stout
a
bit
thin
a
small
amount
of
lingering
bitterness
not
heavy
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
hint
of
fruit
at
the
end
but
not
much
this
is
pretty
simple
easy
to
drink
but
not
outstanding
mouth
is
creamy
but
slightly
thin
a
stout
that
is
easily
sessionable
ive
had
this
at
a
few
places
around
town
now
it
has
taken
its
place
atop
my
rankings
for
summit
beers
this
is
quite
good
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
on
tap
at
whistle
binkies
this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
lacing
was
thorough
and
left
rings
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
cream
graham
cracker
and
roasted
malt
but
was
rather
faint
probably
from
the
nitro
system
the
taste
was
very
solid
roasted
malt
cream
graham
cracker
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
silky
smooth
overall
this
is
by
far
summits
best
beer
and
i
wish
they
would
make
it
more
available
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
is
good
at
4
7
it
is
definitely
sessionable
i
think
summit
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
if
you
find
it
give
it
a
try
black
throughout
the
slightest
red
at
the
bottom
creamy
tan
nitrotap
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
quite
sweet
with
some
roasted
coffee
and
malt
the
flavor
also
has
a
fair
amount
of
dark
roated
malt
flavor
but
is
sweet
and
chocolaty
with
cherries
and
some
hops
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
a
sweet
and
smooth
stout
easy
to
drink
pretty
standard
for
the
style
good
work

the

nice
black

a

the
smell
was
nice
and
roasty
taste
had
some
coffee
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
some

mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamysilky
with
light
carbonation
and
was
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
for
the
style
drinkability
was
fair
and
this
would
make
a
hearty
addition
to
a
good
meal
especially
breakfast
d
this
doesnt
come
out
to
assult
your
senses
the
taste
begins
to
grow
and
become
more
complex
and
you
really
start
to
appreciate
this
beer
like
guinesss
made
to
drink
a
ton
off
by
being
ultra
smooth
and
sessionable
i
just
wish
they
would
brew
this
more
often
not
just
around

smell
was
a
very
mellow
oatmeal
coffee
scent
the
oatmeal
really
smoothed
over
the
edges
of
this
stout
lending
to
a
very
high
drinakability
nothing
offensive
or
harsh
in
the
flavor
still
this
is
a
good
representative
of
the
oatmeal
stout
style
the
appearance
is
black
with
a
nice
full
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
mild
and
sweet
the
taste
is
complex
with
hints
of
oatmeal
burnt
chocolate
plum
and
just
a
very
slight
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
a
great
addition
to
the
summit
lineup
as
it
warms
i
get
a
little
hit
of
mineral

perhaps
a
small

summit
needs
to
make
this
beer
a
regular
i
had
it
on
tap
at
old
chicago
in
st
cloud
and
it
was
terrific
i
love
nitropoured
beers
for
their
creaminess
and
this
beer
was
creamy
and
full
bodied
i
have
had
a
few
benchmark
oatmeal
stouts
and
this
beer
blows
them
out
of
the
water
sam
smith
who
i
liked
this
a
lot
a
great
addition
to
the
summit
lineup
at
first
i
was
like
ehh
its
ok
but
as
it
went
along
i
liked
it
more
and
more
it
grows
on
ya
as
you
start
to
find
the
little
things
inside
that
make
it
interestingly
good
the
overall
smooth
and
soft
character
of
this
stout
makes
it
quaffable
for
sure
surprisingly

smooth

with
a
whiff

character
it
was
served
way
too
cold
but
even
at
frozen
temps
it
was
still
pretty
enjoyable
and
not
at
all
harsh
which
will
help
its
general
sales
after
warming
the
oatmeal
and
chocolate
aroma
became
more
evident
and

drinkable
and
while
nothing
that
is

it
is

imo
cant

enough
love
it
o
4
i
had
had
this
beer
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
and
finally
got
around
to
drinking
it
it
was
a
solid
beer
very
respectable
didnt
blow
me
away
in
any
category
but
good
all
around
roasted
malts
are
evident
very
watery
for
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
decent
12oz
into
a
mug
wow
the
coffee
aroma
is
huge
taste
is
a
bit
too
much
coffee
actually
this
is
almost
like
drinking
coffee
maybe
more
oatmeal
and
roasted
malt
would
help
round
out
this
beer
i
feel
like
i
should
mix
this
with
another
stout
the
flavour
is
on
point
if
you
drank
it
without
a
label
you
could
label
it
lovely
just
dont
like
the
coffee
flavor
of
this
at
all
very
good
best
coffee
beer
that
im
aware
of
in
the
midwest
region
just
as
good
by
the
6
pack
bottle
as
it
is
by
the
jug
from
the
brewery
coffee
connoisseurs
this
is
the
coffee
beer
for
you
good
beer
definitely
get
that
iced
coffee
taste
with
it
wouldnt
complain
if
it
was
a
little
thicker
good
nose
chocolate
and
coffee
o
very
good
beer
i
dont
delve
much
into
stouts
especially
coffee
stouts
but
i
must
say
this
is
the
absolute
best
coffee
stout
i
have
had
to
date
i
have
heard
their
java
stout
is
better
but
i
will
reserve
judgement
until
i
try
it
at
a
later
date
overall
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
and
its
always
great
to
support
local
truly
a
beauty
and
from
a
brewery
i
never
heard
of
before
this
one
its
a
real
pleasant
surprise
dark
brown
pushing
black
shiny
but
not
letting
hardly
any
light
in
the
head
is
an
inch
high
settles
but
keeps
stiff
peaks
like
well
beaten
eggs
great
nose
too
coffee
and
roasted
unmalted
barley
meet
right
in
the
middle
with
the
coffee
taking
the
lead
on
the
taste
i
get
a
little
sweetness
to
this
although
i
dont
think
its
a
milk
stout
it
just
has
that
sweet
body
and
lingering
finish
a
fantastic
medium
to
transfer
these
flavors
early
bitter
coffee
but
more
balanced
than
most
of
its
peers
its
still
a
beer
yet
the
coffee
does
something
unique
to
this
fresh
brewed
coffee
all
the
way
though
i
love
how
the
carbonation
rises
up
at
the
end
and
crisps
up
a
medium
bodied
finish
soft
and
delicate
in
feel
but
about
as
robust
as
they
come
in
terms
of
flavor
the
use
of
coffee
here
is
as
good
as
any
while
the
base
beer
is
great
and
distinct
i
think
the
use
of
coffee
rivals
the
best
in
the
business
the
very
best
my
first
beer
from
bent
river
had
my
palate
wet
for
many
more
love
this
12
oz
bottle
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
when
i
pour
this
beer
into
a
glass
the
head
is
for
lack
of
a
better
word
unmanageable
takes
10
minutes
for
the
head
to
die
down
so
it
takes
a
long
time
from
opening
this
beer
until
the
time
i
get
to
drink
any
the
head
itself
tastes
like
an
ashtraynot
indicative
of
the
taste
of
the
beer
the
beer
itself
has
nice
roasted
coffee
flavor
but
a
little
too
thin
for
my
liking
its
just
ok
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
snifter
it
has
a
cola
look
and
smelled
like
cheap
coffee
smell
is
overpoweringly
coffee
i
did
not
really
taste
beer
in
this
at
all
rather
it
tasted
like
cold
folgers
it
didnt
taste
like
it
was
brewed
with
coffee
it
tasted
like
someone
poured
a
little
bit
of
stout
into
stale
coffee
i
wont
be
trying
again
o
pretty
pedestrian
coffee
stout
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
i
poured
this
promising
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
black
looking
brew
with
a
tan
head
the
head
did
not
last
very
long
at
all
the
beer
mostly
tasted
like
coffee
cold
coffee
cold
heavy
coffee
with
a
handful
of
sugar
thrown
in
it
it
was
cold
coffee
to
me
and
not
beer
i
will
not
buy
again
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
well
balanced
flavor
that
complemented
the
aroma
sampled
last
night
on
91813
chilled
down
to
36
degrees
in
my
beer
cooler
and
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
glass
from
a
local
brewery
pours
black
in
color
with
a
very
small
thin
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
of
fresh
black
espresso
coffee
hits
you
right
up
front
with
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
much
as
would
be
expected
with
the
smell
black
coffee
with
a
hop
finish
but
not
overpowering
at
all
this
is
a
great
sipping
brew
and
not
a
chugging
type
of
beer
overall
a
great
oatmeal
stout
with
coffee
added
brew
overall
id
buy
a
six
pack
this
definitely
rivals
speedway
stout
soggy
and
wet
throw
my
pampers
all
around
your
neck
notes
of
deep
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
little
pine
really
really
really
yummy
stout
flavor
one
of
the
best
domestic
stouts
ive
ever
sampled
mouthfeel
leaves
a
stouty
soul
wanting
there
should
be
much
thicker
body
here
mouthfeel
somewhat
oily
still
yummy
as
hell
the
middle
of
the
pint
is
ripe
with
deep
malt
flavors
would
totally
drink
again
many
times
my
god
this
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
coffee
stouts
on
earth
it
smells
like
a
fantastic
cup
of
dark
chocolate
with
coffee
the
flavor
is
a
much
much
subdued
version
of
this
but
dont
get
me
wrong
this
tastes
good
its
a
bit
on
the
thin
end
of
stouts
but
nothing
too
far
out
of
whack
quite
solid
overall
a
very
good
illinois
beer
fans
of
heavy
stouts
will
definitely
like
this
one
had
on
tap
at
bistro
101
very
rich
coffee
taste
was
very
smooth
smells
like
what
i
would
expect
from
a
oatmeal
stout
has
an
appealing
color
from
the
tap
head
was
thick
and
foamy
but
was
not
abundant
has
a
great
mouthfeel
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
gladly
have
another
pint
highly
complex
well
balanced
and
drinkable
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
coffee
stout
i
have
tasted
drinkability
i
was
a
little
leery
of
buying
this
because
i
had
never
seen
bent
river
beer
bottled
and
was
concerned
there
would
be
packaging
issues
however
this
is
decent
enough
out
of
the
bottle
to
make
me
want
to
have
a
draft
flavor
is
big
on
coffee
mellow
and
roasty
malts
and
is
smooth
and
light
bodied
light
lingering
bitterness
from
the
coffee
id
guess
wholesome
and
satisfying
equal
parts
roast
malt
and
bitter
coffee
hints
of
dark
chocolate
smooth
and
integrated
feel
seemingly
simple
yet
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
definitely
something
to
see
out
a
solid
coffee
stout
from
bent
river
this
beer
and
bent
rivers
jalapeno
brew
were
the
two
beers
that
got
me
hooked
onto
microbrews
from
the
generic
everyday
beers
that
i
was
accustomed
to
i
cant
help
but
to
stop
into
bent
river
and
have
at
least
one
pint
of
uncommon
every
time
i
happen
to
find
myself
in
the
moline
area
as
stated
this
is
a
coffee
beer
very
coffee
not
just
a
little
so
if
you
dont
like
coffee
dont
drink
it
my
advice
is
try
it
if
you
can
because
if
you
can
you
are
probably
in
the
quad
cities
and
your
options
are
limited
and
some
batches
seem
to
hit
the
spot
and
as
an
annual
visitor
the
brewery
seems
to
be
getting
a
grip
on
the
quality
control
and
achieving
more
consistency
with
their
flagship
beers
of
which
this
is
one
i
have
enjoyed
coffee
stouts
in
the
past
but
this
one
was
a
bit
too
onedimensional
for
repeated
tastings
judging
from
the
other
higher
scores
i
may
have
had
a
bad
pour
but
i
dont
think
so
notes
i
first
had
this
beer
shortly
after
i
turned
21
it
was
one
of
the
first
stouts
i
had
other
than
guinness
and
helped
expand
my
concept
of
what
beer
can
be
i
thought
coffee
in
beer
thats
crazy
but
this
is
a
good
beer
too

this

has
a
future

of

the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted

with
some
fresh
roasted
and
ground
coffee
beans
very
nice
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
nice
flavor
of
coffee
that
is
not
strong
or
overpowering
like
some
coffee
stouts
i
have
tried
very
smooth
and
goes
down

no

no

mouthfeel
this
is
an
excellent
brew
poured
into
a
snifter
color
was
dark
brown
but
not
quite
opaque
it
rather
resembled
coffee
very
light
milkcolored
head
strong
smell
of
coffee
very
strong
taste
of
burnt
coffee
but
lacked
other
complimentary
flavors
starts
strong
but
finishes
rather
weak
it
could
have
used
some
chocolate
very
light
carbonation
not
a
bad
stout
but
cannot
be
compared
to
say
founders
breakfast
stout
serving
type
bottle
prost
overall
a
very
nice
stout
i
love
coffee
stouts
and
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
way
to
go
schlafly
o
3
5
i
bought
this
one
on
a
lark
and
probably
wont
again
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
thought
the
coffee
taste
was
too
overthetop
overall
i
really
liked
the
balance
and
drinkability
of
this
coffee
stout
im
generally
pretty
impressed
with
schlaflys
i
wish
this
was
a
bit
thicker
and
had
a
higher
abv
but
i
get
what
they
were
going
for
of
you
love
coffee
and
stout
you
cant
go
wrong
nice
on
a
cold
winters
day
very
drinkable
not
heavy
at
all
just
wish
there
was
a
brighter
coffee
flavor
here
o
a
very
nice
surprise
i
went
right
out
and
bought
a
sixer
at
only
8
this
is
a
steal
recommended
for
coffee
beer
fans
stout
of
the
schlafly
is
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
for
coffee
lovers
only
thought
the
moderate
alcohol
might
make
for
a
thin
beer
but
plenty
of
roasty
chocolatey
coffee
flavor
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
bit
of
tang
and
bitterness
good
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
aroma
is
roasty
malt
coffee
grounds
a
touch
of
chocolate
licorice
and
rounded
out
by
nutty
malt
sweetness
flavor
reveals
strong
coffee
dominance
throughout
accented
by
dark
chocolate
theres
a
touch
of
an
acrid
character
initially
which
fades
in
the
lightly
bitter
roasty
finish
toasted
nuts
emerge
in
the
aftertaste
coffee
isnt
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
well
constructed
beer
1700
reviewed
o
too
much
of
a
good
thing
this
is
like
coffee
with
some
stout
thrown
in
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
i
like
the
smell
of
it
this
would
be
a
great
breakfast
stout
it
is
not
one
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
overall
a
fine
local
coffee
stout
that
is
balanced
quite
well
no
offensive
flavours
works
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
not
as
much
coffee
and
i
was
expecting
tastes
just
like
a
regular
stout
good
nonetheless
pours
a
dark
brown
with
thin
tan
head
nose
is
straight
coffee
deep
roasted
coffee
ground
with
undertow
of
chocolate
and
roast
taste
is
much
a
like
a
chilled
black
coffee
nice
robust
coffee
notes
along
with
notes
of
oats
charred
grain
and
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
with
mild
carbonation
overall
very
nice
coffee
character
in
this
beer
brown
in
a
pint
class
lots
of
tan
head
aroma
of
fresh
coffee
beans
flavor
is
okay
lots
of
coffee
there
more
bitterness
though
a
little
bit
roasty
some
candylike
or
syrupy
sweetness
on
the
back
end
overall
good
but
not
my
favorite
coffee
stout
o
a
delicious
coffee
stout
everything
is
in
great
balance
and
exactly
what
a
coffee
stout
should
be
overall
this
is
a
great
black
coffee
stout
i
get
sweetened
iced
black
coffee
during
the
summer
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
recommended
if
you
like
those
flavors
really
liked
this
stout
from
schlafly
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
stout
glass
awesome
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
burnt
and
robust
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
tape
fluffy
head
great
balance
try
it
with
dessert
or
a
smoky
pork
smooth
down
the
gullet
so
good
o
i
think
i
covered
it
in
taste
but
i
had
this
on
tap
a
week
ago
and
craved
it
all
week
i
manged
to
find
the
last
6pack
in
one
of
my
local
spots
and
while
the
bottle
isnt
quite
the
experience
the
tap
was
i
would
still
recommend
this
beer
to
all
lovers
of
stouts
and
coffee
o
a
well
done
coffee
stout
considering
all
of
them
that
have
been
done
o
if
you
like
oat
stouts
this
is
a
good
one
just
a
nice
hint
of
coffee
bottle
poured
a
deep
black
color
stout
with
a
large
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
dry
coffee
notes
with
light
roasted
malt
taste
is
dominated
by
dry
bitter
coffee
notes
with
and
almost
spicy
finish
light
bitter
black
chocolate
notes
are
also
noticeable
body
is
a
bit
light
for
style
with
good
carbonation
too
bitter
for
my
taste
with
coffee
notes
veering
into
stringency
territory
the
mouthfeel
is
too
light
for
me
i
feel
it
should
be
creamier
the
carbonation
bites
the
middle
of
the
tongue
finishes
with
a
little
residue
on
the
tongue
overall
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
osolid
coffee
stout
but
comes
up
short
when
compared
to
others
however
for
the
price
its
a
solid
offering
at
the
alcohol
was
light
here
as
there
was
hardly
any
booze
to
be
detected
as
i
did
shots
of
this
coffee
er
beer
while
i
like
something
that
pushes
the
edge
a
bit
something
was
missing
here
maybe
it
was
the
oats
some
more
powder
to
the
chocolate
or
some
more
bubbles
to
give
this
some
life
espresso
tends
to
be
watery
flat
and
bitter
and
thats
what
this
was
too
if
thats
your
thing
drink
away
it
will
save
you
a
trip
to
the
place
with
the
long
lines
green
aprons
and
hum
of
the
coffee
machines
oone
of
the
few
times
schlafly
has
disappointed
me
i
was
expecting
better
on
this
one
o
not
bad
not
great
either
one
for
diehard
coffee
lovers
to
seek
out
but
if
not
i
would
probably
leave
on
the
shelf
the
beer
pour
a
light
brownish
and
creamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
still
leaves
some
film
on
the
beer
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
color
that
almost
appears
like
a
dark
black
that
resembles
coffee
as
expected
the
beer
is
opaque
the
beer
has
a
very
strong
coffee
smell
and
dominates
the
other
smells
however
the
other
smells
such
as
the
hint
of
oatmeal
and
roasted
malts
compliment
the
beer
instead
of
detracting
from
it
the
taste
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
expectation
of
the
smell
but
still
works
well
coffee
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
slight
complemented
by
the
oatmeal
and
roasted
malts
the
beer
feels
surprisingly
light
for
a
heavy
bodied
beer
with
biting
carbonation
the
beer
itself
feels
smooth
as
it
goes
down
overall
a
pretty
decent
coffee
stout
and
worth
getting
again
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
enjoyed
the
complexities
of
the
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
flavors
i
love
coffee
so
im
always
slightly
biased
on
my
enjoyment
and
rating
of
this
type
of
beer
so
i
would
recommend
this
brew
since
the
coffee
flavors
were
very
tasty
to
me
this
is
a
touch
unorthodox
with
the
earthy
pepper
flavor
chocolate
and
coffee
but
it
is
quite
good
a
quality
beer
that
is
not
particularly
complex
could
use
a
few
more
flavors
id
especially
like
to
see
a
bit
more
chocolate
finding
this
well
not
exactly
mediocre
but
uninspiring
has
a
funny
sweetness
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
beers
like
southern
tier
mokah
and
creme
brulee
also
has
some
distinct
milk
stout
characteristics
which
i
wasnt
expecting
o
nice
coffee
flavors
in
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
poor
mans
fbs
would
pair
nicely
with
desserts
or
chocolate
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
this
is
a
bit
of
a
one
trick
pony
lots
of
coffee
flavors
that
are
nice
but
it
needs
some
more
stout
flavors
to
balance
this
out
still
enjoyable
though
coffee
stout
is
a
classic
combination
ofa
traditional
stout
and
premium
french
roast
coffee
from
st
louis
roaster
kaldis
coffee
roasted
barley
and
coffee
dominate
the
aroma
with
the
sweetness
from
the
stout
balancing
the
acidity
of
the
coffee
we
use
a
unique
cold
toddy
extraction
process
to
brew
a
less
acidic
coffee
for
the
beer
wrongly
picked
this
beer
at
night
when
i
wanted
to
sleep
medium
body
well
carbonated
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
well
crafted
drinkable
coffee
stout
without
the
acrid
bitterness
that
ruins
some
of
similar
ilk
schlafly
should
get
more
attention
these
days
their
beers
are
continually
tasty
year
in
and
year
out
yummy
grab
a
bottle
o
a
really
good
coffee
stout
but
i
kept
the
overall
score
in
check
because
it
is
pretty
onedimensional
but
it
is
a
really
enjoyable
dimension
they
bring
in
this
brew
overall
decent
stout
with
an
average
coffee
flavor
i
would
drink
it
again
but
there
are
some
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
overall
if
you
want
some
coffee
with
a
tad
bit
of
alcohol
go
for
this
it
was
very
drinkable
but
forgetable
as
a
beer
because
of
the
coffeeesque
thin
mouthfeel
and
one
dimentional
flavor
profile
ive
had
worse
coffee
beers
for
sure
but
definitely
better
ones
as
well
the
beers
appearance
is
an
oily
black
with
a
bubbly
sodalike
head
the
aroma
contains
hints
of
darkroasted
coffee
beans
grains
and
a
touch
of
something
sweet
my
nose
also
detected
a
small
presence
of
oxidation
the
flavor
has
a
nice
bitter
coffee
flavor
and
as
advertised
the
cold
toddy
extraction
process
does
indeed
produce
a
less
acidic
flavor
its
rather
light
no
doubt
benefiting
from
the
breadiness
of
the
oatmeal
as
well
the
overall
mouthfeel
however
might
be
a
little
too
light
and
carbonated
a
bit
of
a
let
down
compared
to
the
expected
velvety
softness
that
one
might
get
with
other
oatmeal
stouts
such
as
new
hollands
the
poet
this
might
not
be
the
best
coffee
stout
ever
made
but
the
uniqueness
of
the
coffee
blending
and
its
resulting
flavor
are
enough
to
give
it
merit
o
lets
just
say
that
this
beer
made
me
change
my
mind
about
schlafly
as
a
result
i
have
become
a
fan
of
a
couple
of
their
beers
this
isnt
a
complex
stout
by
any
means
but
that
is
part
of
the
charm
its
simple
yet
very
well
done
this
stout
is
one
of
my
everyday
staples
overall
simple
but
very
good
not
too
bitter
but
yet
tons
of
coffee
flavor
must
pair
this
one
with
the
chocolate
cake
at
the
brewpub
o
i
like
this
more
than
their
oatmeal
stout
from
which
this
is
derived
from
great
seasonal
and
tastes
amazing
on
cask
prost
this
one
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
cola
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
nose
features
authentic
coffee
sans
creamer
just
black
almost
espresso
mild
coffee
bitterness
light
baking
chocolate
and
a
subtle
malty
sweetness
the
flavors
are
well
rounded
and
approachable
there
is
a
good
amount
of
coffee
with
moderate
bitterness
baking
chocolate
smooth
dark
malts
obviously
some
roast
and
a
light
chocolateoatmeal
malty
sweetness
it
has
nice
flavor
it
drinks
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
in
body
and
leaves
behind
a
nice
amount
of
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
level
of
coffee
is
impressive
considering
this
beer
is
an
oatmeal
stout
registering
in
at
just
5
7
overy
good
stout
very
drinkable
with
just
the
right
amount
of
coffee
flavor
and
for
a
86
pack
you
cant
go
wrong
solid
beer
for
sure
especially
if
you
are
on
a
budget
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
received
in
a
beer
of
the
month
6
pack
from
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
virginia
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
pitch
black
color
with
a
small
brownish
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
darkly
roasted
coffee
nothing
else
tastes
of
coffee
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
but
definate
dark
coffee
taste
dominates
like
there
is
still
coffee
beans
in
it
not
actually
but
that
taste
beer
goes
down
real
smooth
for
this
lightmedium
bodied
beer
and
is
carbonated
perfectly
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
stout
if
you
like
coffee
this
is
a
good
one
for
you
as
the
coffee
is
prominent
without
being
harsh
or
bitter
pours
black
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
light
mostly
coffee
tastes
like
a
pretty
good
stout
with
a
single
shot
of
espresso
the
coffee
here
is
not
as
up
front
as
i
expected
i
like
my
coffee
stouts
strong
it
is
however
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
coffee
doesnt
come
through
until
the
middle
and
the
drink
finishes
out
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
to
it
overall
definitely
a
good
beer
but
ill
take
one
with
stronger
coffee
if
i
can
find
it
overall
impression
after
each
drink
i
thought
to
myself
is
this
oncask
very
creamy
and
easy
going
down
of
course
it
was
still
full
bodied
but
very
nice
with
coffee
character
but
anyone
can
enjoy
im
looking
to
enjoy
my
bottle
of
this
within
the
week
as
well
and
compare
o
overall
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
one
of
those
stouts
that
smells
and
tastes
like
coffee
grounds
its
very
strong
would
have
it
again
balanced
this
beers
pretty
good
o
drinkable
damn
drinkable
but
not
crazy
about
it
subtle
flavors
almost
playing
it
too
safe
wish
the
stout
body
and
flavors
came
in
full
force
and
coffee
had
a
big
fresh
presence
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
spend
much
perfect
they
went
exactly
where
they
were
headed
they
designed
a
recipe
and
hit
the
target
excellent
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
i
have
to
say
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
especially
for
the
price
this
is
definitely
a
beer
for
coffeelovers
so
if
you
cant
stand
it
then
buyer
beware
for
me
though
this
is
an
example
of
the
style
done
right
but
id
like
to
have
gotten
a
bit
more
of
the
underlying
oatmeal
stout
12
oz
into
imperial
pint
pours
a
rich
black
color
with
very
little
head
and
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
out
of
the
glass
is
immediately
of
the
coffee
roast
and
chocolate
malts
it
actually
smells
just
like
a
good
cup
of
espresso
the
flavor
is
exactly
the
same
with
a
slight
hint
of
the
roast
with
an
overwhelming
flavor
of
espresso
the
finish
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
to
fully
appreciate
the
complexity
and
subtlety
of
all
the
flavors
o
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
brew
overall
with
a
pretty
tasty
flavor
profile
theres
a
good
amount
of
coffee
flavor
without
being
too
unbalanced
this
wasnt
quite
as
smooth
as
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
but
the
lighter
feel
of
this
beer
coupled
with
the
lighter
abv
makes
it
session
worthy
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
beer
again
especially
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
bodied
stout
pours
a
deep
brown
nearing
black
big
mochacolored
head
with
nice
lacing
as
it
goes
down
good
retention
as
well
thin
collar
afterward
the
nose
carries
a
really
nice
bit
of
coffee
with
some
mild
cream
slight
roast
as
well
flavor
has
a
good
coffee
and
roast
combination
with
a
slight
creaminess
behind
it
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
slightly
chewy
quite
good
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
nice
coffee
smell
slight
sweet
malt
coffee
taste
though
out
that
fades
slightly
nice
balance
and
carbonation
as
with
any
good
oatmeal
stout
just
a
great
coffee
stout
that
is
not
to
filling
or
overpowering
certainly
could
drink
many
wish
this
was
available
in
this
area
would
drink
again
m
thin
to
medium
body
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
relatively
clean
dry
finish
o
a
solid
coffee
stout
a
poor
mouthfeel
holds
this
one
back
from
being
something
more
o
overall
not
bad
looks
nice
and
smells
and
tastes
like
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
considering
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
oatmeal
stout
good
nonetheless
overall
the
drink
feels
bigger
than
the
low
abv
hints
at
this
however
tastes
better
than
it
smells
but
its
just
another
solid
beer
from
this
brewery
overally
not
too
bad
but
ive
had
much
better
crafted
and
flavored
coffeeoatmeal
stouts
mouthfeeloverall
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
very
smooth
and
creamy
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
coffee
stout
nice
flavors
in
this
an
awesome
coffee
stout
with
none
of
the
offputting
green
pepper
flavors
that
i
often
find
in
beers
actually
brewed
with
coffee
enjoying
it
right
now
with
waffles
and
its
kicking
a
lot
of
ass
o
this
was
good
but
beer
like
founders
breakfast
stout
and
wake
n
wake
beats
this
with
one
taste
bud
tied
behind
its
back
i
had
my
second
glass
with
a
snickers
and
it
was
awesome
nice
basic
stout
overall
i
enjoy
the
abundant
coffeeness
of
this
beer
its
a
great
dessert
beer
and
its
watery
feel
makes
it
go
down
almost
too
fast
but
if
you
love
coffee
then
youll
want
to
try
this
beer
for
sure
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
a
lot
this
year
i
had
it
last
year
and
dont
remember
liking
it
as
much
as
i
do
now
seems
richer
with
more
coffee
and
definitely
a
stronger
all
around
flavor
profile
than
i
remember
this
will
become
a
yearly
wintertime
staple
for
me
im
sure
from
now
on
since
coffee
stouts
are
pretty
much
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
it
is
easy
to
find
in
nashville
easy
to
drink
tastes
great
and
is
reasonably
priced
another
solid
product
from
schlafly
not
a
terrible
beer
but
completely
forgettable
and
not
enjoyable
enough
for
me
to
finish
nothing
id
ever
revisit
again
unless
its
on
draft
i
do
enjoy
coffee
stouts
when
theyre
done
correctly
and
sadly
for
schlafly
this
was
not
overall
i
find
the
thin
mouthfeel
forgivable
as
i
really
like
the
flavor
profile
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
coffee
beer
style
o
good
coffee
beer
excellent
nose
and
coffee
flavor
very
drinkable
o
really
enjoyed
this
this
offering
from
schlafly
not
overpowering
just
a
nice
touch
of
character
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
black
as
night
and
smells
just
like
a
cupa
joe
rich
white
head
has
a
wonderful
coffee
taste
blended
with
their
oatmeal
stout
and
all
of
its
goodness
locally
roasted
beans
gives
this
a
distinct
flavor
apart
from
other
coffee
stouts
not
at
all
acidic
as
some
can
be
smooth
mouthfeel
good
coffee
buzz
perfect
for
a
rainy
morning
with
a
hangover
o
other
than
the
watery
mouthfeel
this
was
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
the
flavors
werent
overpowering
and
they
werent
nonexistent
i
will
pick
up
more
of
this
when
i
can
drinkability
i
am
impressed
this
is
truly
a
coffee
stout
in
the
sense
it
smells
like
coffee
and
tastes
like
stout
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
coffee
stout
that
needs
a
little
more
of
the
sweet
creamer
quality
in
the
taste
otherwise
the
nose
and
mouth
feel
are
great
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
bitter
strong
from
the
back
moving
forward
interesting
beer
overall
too
sweetness
minimal
a
nice
little
stout
for
sure
i
guess
you
could
say
this
might
be
typical
for
a
stout
but
it
really
made
the
beer
seem
flat
and
dead
there
are
to
many
other
great
stouts
on
the
market
for
me
to
rank
this
any
higher
not
terrible
but
not
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
6pack
overall
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
at
schlafly
and
its
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
it
could
be
a
true
masterpiece
if
it
had
a
real
american
stout
backbone
to
it
nevertheless
one
of
the
best
of
its
substyle
pours
a
brownish
body
w
quick
dying
largesized
head
on
top
of
a
beer
w
an
aroma
of
coffee
roasted
burnt
chocolaty
malts
as
well
as
dry
breadyoakiness
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
stout
pulling
off
a
tricky
balancing
act
as
at
first
i
found
this
beer
real
smooth
almost
creamy
w
sweetness
emanating
from
chococlate
caramel
and
possible
touches
of
vanilla
toffee
and
oats
then
an
afterfinish
w
a
burst
of
tasty
roasted
coffee
malt
that
gives
it
a
strong
dry
hearty
finish
overall
an
easy
to
drink
and
lowpriced
stout
that
is
a
great
beer
could
bee
sessionable
for
acidic
almost
acrid
coffee
beer
lovers
a
great
offering
by
the
guys
at
schlafly
complex
and
great
looking
well
worth
the
tiny
price
tag
great
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
on
this
one
being
almost
more
brown
aleesque
than
stout
but
i
think
it
works
fine
with
the
coffee
flavors
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
a
coffee
lover
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
exceptional
but
a
solid
sessionable
coffee
beer
thatd
be
a
staple
if
locally
available
o
very
nice
4
5
d
after
a
promising
start
in
terms
of
appearance
and
smell
this
one
sort
of
falls
of
a
cliff
the
palette
is
muddled
and
a
bit
on
the
timid
side
and
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
off
putting
not
recommended
as
i
can
think
of
several
coffee
infused
brews
that
i
would
put
first
sidenote
i
tried
this
same
beer
in
the
taproom
at
the
brewery
and
it
was
if
i
remember
correctly
loads
better
maybe
this
particular
beer
just
suffered
in
the
bottle
notes
i
do
like
schlafly
and
some
of
their
offerings
are
amongst
my
favorites
but
here
this
is
by
far
the
worst
ive
had
from
them
maybe
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
but
while
not
despicable
this
is
in
the
bottom
bracket
of
coffeeoatmeal
stouts
ive
tried
not
sure
how
the
cardspads
game
turned
out
but
it
was
shaping
up
to
be
entertaining
now
to
this
brew
here
it
pours
a
murky
dark
burnt
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
dusty
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
rich
coffee
aroma
with
some
mild
molasses
dusty
dark
chocolate
and
lightly
chlorinated
wheat
rollicking
behind
the
taste
embitters
the
coffee
while
simultaneously
complimenting
it
with
some
rye
notes
the
chocolate
also
gets
some
bitterness
were
nearing
cookin
choc
here
and
the
roasted
malts
seem
rather
burnt
a
hint
of
light
leather
hides
in
the
back
the
body
is
a
lightly
hefty
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
coffee
stout
though
the
bitterness
borders
on
harshness
i
could
see
drinking
more
of
them
though
feels
a
bit
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
coffee
upfront
the
coffee
lingers
for
a
pleasant
aftertaste
provided
you
are
a
coffee
drinker
moderate
carbonation
goes
over
well
overall
its
an
okay
coffee
stout
what
is
a
kind
way
to
say
middle
of
the
pack
truthfully
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
the
coffee
is
pleasant
not
stale
or
burnt
and
the
body
makes
this
beer
especially
drinkable
dare
i
say
sessionable
my
big
nitpicks
with
this
beer
are
that
its
unpleasantly
carbonated
thin
and
overly
sweet
if
this
were
available
to
me
i
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
it
on
a
shelf
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
d
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
this
one
is
very
drinkable
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
out
of
the
tap
drinkable
yep
drinkability
on
a
positive
note
this
beer
is
highly
sessionable
unfortunately
i
was
looking
for
something
with
more
substance
i
could
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
these
but
id
rather
have
one
glass
of
a
more
complex
fullerbodied
stout
d
pretty
excellent
as
far
as
coffee
stouts
are
concerned
the
mouthfeel
never
becomes
syrupy
and
theres
nice
balance
here
for
the
coffee
plus
were
only
at
5
7
sessionable
in
my
book
very
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
and
opaque
it
looks
like
coffee
in
the
glass
there
are
powerful
fresh
ground
espresso
bean
aromas
framed
by
faint
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
flavors
are
predominantly
darkroasted
espresso
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
cola
profiles
medium
carbonation
for
a
pleasing
mouth
feel
with
a
very
long
finish
of
roasted
coffee
bean
and
bitter
malt
this
is
very
drinkable
because
it
is
not
overly
sweet
syrupy
or
alcoholic
for
its
style
cheers
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
but
there
are
far
far
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmealcoffee
stout
good
drinkability
and
nice
overall
characters
probably
a
good
session
brew
the
rather
light
mouthfeel
while
perhaps
atypical
for
the
style
actually
adds
to
the
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
draft
at
lyon
hall
arlington
drinkability
pretty
decent
one
for
the
coffee
lovers
dability
aside
from
the
carbonation
a
very
gentle
and
drinkable
coffee
stout
the
mix
of
coffee
and
a
stout
is
perfect
other
than
the
fact
it
was
a
wee
bit
thin
on
the
taste
the
flavor
profile
was
out
of
this
world
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
bitter
hop
bite
its
like
chewing
on
a
coffee
bean
and
for
some
this
can
be
a
wonderful
experience
great
beer
st
louis
brewery
the
strong
black
coffee
taste
was
just
too
much
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
sizable
white
head
looks
like
coffee
with
a
head
the
smell
is
somewhat
lacking
for
a
coffee
beer
i
expected
some
more
coffee
aromas
since
thats
one
of
the
most
distinctive
parts
about
coffee
its
there
but
you
have
to
smell
hard
for
it
the
taste
has
a
coffee
taste
and
bitterness
at
first
but
it
dissapates
rather
quickly
actually
the
first
sip
is
very
impressive
but
as
i
kept
drinking
i
lost
what
that
first
sip
yielded
ive
had
better
coffee
stouts
but
this
is
not
bad
maybe
this
is
becasue
i
like
my
coffee
strong
it
finishes
well
leaving
a
coffeelike
bitterness
behind
its
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
in
the
aspect
of
mouthfeel
definitely
balanced
well
and
is
not
too
acidic
goes
down
easily
but
if
i
wanted
a
go
to
stout
id
go
with
something
else
usually
d
good
to
drink
i
like
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
coffee
stout
great
looking
and
aroma
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
fine
but
not
standout
dvery
sessionable
beer
for
coffee
lovers
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
straightforward
coffee
stout
decent
but
minimal
complexity
and
too
light
colored
and
light
bodied
if
you
go
into
drinking
this
as
it
should
be
a
damn
fine
nightcap
think
again
if
youd
like
a
light
coffee
stout
to
start
your
day
or
to
end
your
work
day
with
a
cup
of
a
joe
meets
beer
here
you
go
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
drinkability
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
definitely
would
drink
again
a
very
good
use
of
coffee
in
the
beer
drinkability
this
one
isnt
bad
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
coffee
beers
that
i
would
choose
before
going
back
very
dark
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
light
spattering
of
spotty
lacing
there
is
coffee
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
balanced
with
some
nice
dark
malt
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
lies
under
the
coffee
the
coffee
is
more
dominat
in
the
flavor
the
coffee
tastes
fresh
and
of
high
quality
a
little
roasted
bitterness
in
the
finish
if
the
stout
characteristics
came
through
more
this
would
be
a
really
good
beer
it
just
cannot
hold
up
to
the
coffee
the
body
is
not
as
chewy
as
i
would
like
it
this
stout
is
nicely
carbonated
a
lower
abv
stout
that
gives
a
good
coffee
fix
flavor
is
of
course
heavy
on
the
coffee
side
with
a
slight
chocolate
hint
smooth
muted
bite
at
the
finish
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
just
not
what
i
expect
in
a
stout
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
smells
like
a
good
coffee
with
a
hit
of
malt
the
taste
is
really
good
its
exactly
what
i
would
want
my
perfect
cup
of
coffee
to
taste
like
if
i
poured
in
a
good
stout
really
like
the
mouth
feel
and
its
amazingly
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
instead
of
my
few
cups
of
joe
in
the
am
but
i
dont
think
work
would
like
that
too
much
i
recomend
this
to
everyone
very
good
job
schlafly
is
this
really
a
coffee
stout
or
just
a
coffee
brown
ale
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
schlaflys
very
strong
on
the
coffee
but
more
or
less
well
executed
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
based
on
the
oatmeal
stout
base
but
it
does
not
detract
from
the
overall
presentation
a
reasonable
abv
makes
this
highly
drinkable
way
to
go
schlafly
i
poured
this
schlaflys
coffee
stout
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
great
carbonation
that
explodes
into
a
creamy
white
head
decent
head
retention
the
color
of
the
stout
is
a
shade
less
then
pitch
black
this
coffee
stout
has
an
oatmeal
stout
as
a
base
and
it
is
brewed
with
locally
roasted
kaldis
coffee
the
aroma
is
wonderful
if
you
are
a
coffee
lover
this
is
the
perfect
fusion
of
beer
and
coffee
as
you
drink
the
foam
clings
to
the
glass
this
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
balanced
with
the
taste
of
coffee
and
slight
hints
of
chocolate
best
coffee
based
beer
i
have
had
i
think
this
is
the
saint
louis
brewerys
greatest
victory
the
only
problem
is
that
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
i
could
drink
this
year
around
now
if
i
can
only
get
my
employer
to
put
this
on
tap
next
to
the
coffee
pot
prost
the
near
overpowering
coffee
grind
notes
can
be
a
little
alarming
at
first
but
this
is
a
coffee
stout
and
in
the
end
everything
evens
out
in
the
end
to
create
a
wellrounded
and
wellcrafted
brew
that
should
easily
give
any
coffee
and
or
beer
lover
their
fix
this
stuff
is
pretty
good
very
tasty
and
satisfying
on
a
winter
night
drinkability
i
rather
like
this
beer
some
may
be
turned
off
by
the
abundance
of
coffee
flavors
and
aromas
but
i
found
it
most
enjoyable
this
would
be
a
wonderful
after
dinner
beer
maybe
even
enjoy
this
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
ice
cream
on
a
cold
cold
night
probably
wouldnt
want
to
tackle
this
on
a
summers
day
however
its
worth
a
try
and
ill
pick
it
up
again
sometime
soon
for
sure
overall
a
very
nice
stout
that
would
pair
well
with
a
chocolate
desert
or
as
a
main
course
beer
although
it
would
have
to
be
with
something
rich
enough
to
handle
the
coffee
flavor
possibly
venison
chili
or
beef
pot
pie
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
in
this
brew
it
is
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
dstout
lovers
bewarethis
beer
should
be
listed
as
a
coffee
ale
but
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
overall
an
ok
coffee
stout
theres
decent
coffee
presence
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
off
for
me
overall
this
is
an
awesome
brew
brewed
with
beans
from
a
local
roaster
i
believe
was
a
little
cold
when
it
was
brought
out
but
that
happens
definitely
worth
sampling
if
i
lived
in
st
louis
area
would
be
picking
this
up
as
a
good
lunchafternoon
brew
drinkability
is
great
if
you
love
coffee
beers
this
beer
is
a
must
the
low
abv
and
lighter
body
makes
me
wish
i
bought
a
whole
sixer
instead
of
a
single
also
seriously
coffee
fans
will
like
this
they
really
put
the
effort
into
getting
the
flavor
in
the
beer
hi
angel
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smoky
upfront
qualities
such
as
semisweet
chocolate
and
coffee
feel
wise
its
a
bit
oily
slick
and
pretty
much
full
in
body
though
a
mildly
placed
abv
setting
lighter
bodied
as
everything
else
has
led
to
believe
mouthfeel
and
higher
mid
level
of
carb
are
more
similar
to
a
brown
ale
again
drinkability
is
good
with
this
i
just
would
reach
for
something
else
on
its
own
this
is
fine
just
wouldnt
really
consider
this
a
stout
would
get
this
again
d
this
is
a
fantastic
coffee
stout
this
is
one
of
the
better
schlafly
offerings
out
there
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
drinks
nicely
mildly
filling
but
not
heavy
i
wouldnt
give
up
my
coffee
or
favorite
stouts
for
it
though
and
in
the
realm
of
coffee
stouts
its
tasty
but
not
quite
outstanding
a
highlight
though
is
that
it
isnt
over
done
too
strong
or
too
heavy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
it
has
a
very
nice
flavor
rich
in
body
and
some
flavors
linger
in
the
end
d
nice
to
sip
before
a
bbq
dinner
at
smokey
bones
resturant
not
sure
i
want
to
session
this
overall
a
very
coffee
oriented
beer
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
one
as
i
do
drink
dark
roast
coffee
on
a
daily
basis
if
you
are
a
coffee
drinker
and
also
enjoy
stouts
i
dont
see
how
the
two
wouldnt
go
handinhand
you
will
most
likely
appreciate
this
beer
overall
an
unoffensive
mild
beer
i
am
partial
to
coffee
stouts
and
found
this
one
just
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
and
body
department
to
make
it
a
home
run
for
me
thin
overcarbonated
and
not
what
a
stout
should
be
schlafly
impressed
me
during
my
first
experience
with
their
dryhopped
apa
it
has
since
gone
downhill
d
easy
to
drink
having
one
of
these
by
a
fire
tonight
and
it
is
going
down
very
easy
d
drinkability
is
decent
it
would
be
much
better
if
it
were
a
bit
creamier
without
so
much
harsh
carbonation
not
much
of
an
oatmeal
stout
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
coffee
really
takes
over
everything
along
with
the
chalky
dry
and
acidic
feel
this
is
a
sub
standard
coffee
stout
as
well
not
bad
just
nothing
i
will
visit
again
soon
not
the
most
complex
coffee
stout
and
far
from
the
most
flavorful
but
a
nice
drinkable
sessionable
entry
it
has
a
dark
black
body
with
a
n
average
amount
of
dark
tan
head
it
has
a
strong
coffee
aroma
and
burnt
sugar
smell
it
tastes
of
caramel
and
coffee
with
some
roasted
malt
the
coffee
taste
is
very
strong
if
you
like
beer
and
you
like
coffee
this
is
the
beer
for
you
it
has
a
thick
body
with
average
carbonation
d
if
you
like
lattes
then
you
will
like
this
it
has
a
nice
quaffable
quality
ive
been
known
to
drink
around
six
of
these
at
a
time
more
of
the
session
coffee
stout
if
you
will
i
have
drank
my
fair
share
of
this
beer
and
will
continue
as
its
on
tap
at
my
weekend
pub
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
with
huge
flavors
lower
abv
and
balance
good
stuff
drinkability
the
abv
is
reasonable
and
the
taste
is
very
pleasing
so
i
think
this
is
a
very
easy
brew
to
drink
a
nice
job
by
schlafly
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
maybe
a
little
light
for
a
stout
theres
a
richness
to
it
and
the
feel
stops
just
short
of
thickness
deasy
enough
to
drink
and
overall
still
a
good
beer
but
this
one
is
far
better
out
of
a
bottle
than
on
tap
drinks
pretty
easy
although
the
taste
is
something
overpowering
d
a
lighter
stout
but
still
tasty
taste
is
very
mild
with
a
dry
lingering
finish
the
sweetness
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
its
a
bit
thin
and
watery
as
well
not
much
like
an
oatmeal
stout
which
i
expect
to
be
much
creamier
than
this
very
fizzy
carbonation
hurts
the
drinkability
unfortunately
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
aroma
for
me
it
still
has
plenty
of
coffee
flavor
but
seems
thin
watery
and
lifeless
a
little
bit
of
roastiness
but
no
flavor
contributions
from
the
hops
or
yeast
and
the
malts
could
use
some
more
dextrinous
body
and
sweetness
i
am
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
but
coffee
beer
lovers
should
give
it
a
go
i
should
note
that
the
espresso
used
in
this
beer
is
from
claytonst
louisbased
roaster
kaldis
its
all
freetrade
too
as
problematic
as
that
term
is
its
still
nice
to
see
on
a
beer
overall
i
found
this
to
be
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
either
way
its
a
tasty
beer
with
a
good
sense
of
balance
to
it
12

the
beer
pours
dark

with
about
an

head
retention
and

are
both
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
pretty
straight
forward
it
smells
like
coffee
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
for
the
most
part
just
like
the
aroma
its
mostly
coffee
and
roasted
malt
but
has
a
little
bit
of
a
charredburnt
malt
and
smoky
taste
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
and
its
a
bit
creamy
and
slick
however
it
does
seem
to
be
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
drinkability
is
good
it
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
is
a
good
sessionable
coffee
stout
not
bad
at
all
this
is
interesting
the
roast
flavors
in
the
coffee
the
bitterness
of
the
hop
combine
in
a
sharp
way
that
almost
snaps
on
the
tongue
maybe
its
the
big
bubbles
too
but
this
has
a
way
of
finishing
that
somehow
just
pops
like
pop
rocks

the
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
stout
and
the
drinkability
is
down
one
is
fine
but
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
given
the
potent
bitter
coffee
flavour
there
is
no
lingering
mouth
puckering
hops
bitterness
hanging
around
either
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
use
some
fine
tuning
my
biggest
complaint
was
the
lack
of
balance
there
was
too
much
coffee
flavor
and
not
enough
toasted
malty
goodness
to
balance
it
out
i
could
enjoy
one
of
these
in
a
session
but
thats
all
if
i
were
an
a
m
drinking
man
i
could
see
myself
really
enjoying
this
with
a
plate
of
greasy
fried
eggs
bacon
and
toast
but
i
really
dont
see
myself
doing
that
any
time
soon
its
worth
a
try
but
maybe
not
a
sixpack
pours
a
jet
black
with
just
a
slight
reddish
brown
hue
when
held
in
the
light
the
head
is
pale
brown
in
color
and
not
too
thick
spotty
lacing
in
the
pint
the
nose
is
rather
powerful
like
cold
coffee
thats
been
sitting
all
day
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
bad
way
either
very
aromatic
and
very
intense
espresso
and
roasted
malts
patale
is
dark
espresso
roast
coffee
sweet
malts
and
bakers
chocolate
really
quite
well
done
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
which
isnt
bad
but
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
with
the
strong
flavor
profile
here
id
love
to
see
this
in
a
thicker
slightly
creamier
version
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
lingering
coffee
finish
i
truly
enjoyed
this
brew
very
well
executed
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
an
impressively
wellbalanced
integration
of
coffee
flavor
into
this
stout
poured
black
as
one
would
expect
off
white
head
tinged
with
tan
a
whiff
of
fresh
ground
coffee
beans
in
the
aroma
pleasant
roasted
malt
flavor
was
predominant
with
some
strongbrewed
coffee
in
the
background
a
nice
fullness
to
the
mouthfeel
unlike
some
coffee
stouts
that
taste
like
a
stout
with
some
cold
black
coffee
dumped
in
this
beer
unites
the
flavors
in
a
very
pleasant
way
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
the
taste
make
no
mistakes
this
is
a
coffee
stout
other
coffee
stouts
use
some
really
expensive
mocha
espresso
starbucks
not
this
monster
this
smells
and
tastes
like
the
coffee
grinds
left
in
the
filter
from
your
local
quick
stop
if
youre
a
die
hard
daily
multiple
cup
cheap
coffee
drinkerthen
this
is
your
beer
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
was
fine
i
just
didnt
like
the
strength
and
flavor
of
the
coffee
used
worth
a
try
soft
low
carbonation
gives
a
richer
feel
to
the
mouth
than
is
really
there
a
bit
too
much
coffee
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
but
i
still
like
this
quite
a
bit
smell
is
a
robust
espresso
coffee
flavor
with
a
tad
bit
of
malt
sweetness
tastes
like
cold
coffee
with
fizz
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
what
i
usually
look
for
in
a
stout
this
would
be
greatly
improved
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
added
to
it
this
seems
fairly
one
dimensional
mouthfeel
was
lacking
stout
creaminess
zesty
medium
to
high
carbonation
was
uncharacteristic
this
one
was
more
scrubby
than
expected
moderated
body
d
i
really
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
coffee
mostly
because
i
dont
like
hot
drinks
i
expected
the
coffee
taste
to
be
more
subtle
that
being
said
i
actually
liked
the
beer
d
the
ales
espressolike
body
is
a
great
change
of
pace
providing
both
an
acidic
strength
and
an
oatmeal
smoothness
well
happy
to
see
this
on
local
shelves
the
beer
delivers
a
big
aromatic
punch
of
espresso
beans
and
roasted
goodness
its
all
about
the
coffee
up
front
flavors
are
dominated
by
solidly
brewed
espresso
with
a
supporting
stout
character
the
stout
has
difficulty
standing
up
to
the
immense
coffee
characteristics
but
contributes
malt
sweetness
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
the
oats
in
the
brew
round
the
coffee
nicely
but
maybe
too
much
so
the
beer
needs
some
rough
edges
to
compete
with
the
coffee
acidity
and
strength
feels
full
and
rich
to
the
mouth
and
finishes
with
a
velvety
slickness
aftertastes
are
all
coffee
in
nature
a
good
beer
but
an
american
stout
backbone
would
have
been
better
thanks
ric
nice
stuff
i
am
intrigued
by
this
stout
its
both
flavorful
and
approachable
its
a
sessionable
coffee
stout
this
is
the
first
schlafly
product
ive
bought
and
its
made
a
good
first
impression
on
this
beer
advocate
12
oz
bottle
the
brew
pours
a
deep
brown
to
almost
black
color
with
a
faint
ruby
highlite
around
the
edges
the
head
is
massive
working
up
to
3
fingers
tall
it
leaves
really
nice
lace
as
it
falls
to
about
a
finger
over
top
there
is
little
to
no
carbonation
working
up
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroms
on
this
one
is
all
about
the
coffee
it
smells
like
a
nice
moderate
roast
coffee
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
creamyness
from
the
oatmeal
stout
base
this
one
really
smells
a
lot
like
freshly
ground
coffee
i
like
it
the
flavor
brings
the
same
intensity
of
coffee
that
i
found
in
the
aroma
this
carries
all
the
way
through
the
beer
the
aftertaste
presents
a
mild
creamy
oat
character
with
a
mild
roasted
maltyness
but
it
definately
screams
coffee
here
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
it
is
a
little
slick
from
the
oats
but
nothing
bad
i
think
this
is
an
incredibly
good
coffee
stout
with
a
ton
of
coffee
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
it
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
i
think
that
is
what
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
i
am
happy
to
have
4
more
of
these
6

6pack
one
of
the
better
products
from
the
nice
folks
at

well
put

stout

is

pleasure
to
sip

at
the

looks

gone
very
quickly
black
served
too
cold
to
have

taste
is
really
really
bland
at
least
for
what
i
was
expecting
too
yeasty
and
not
really
coffee
flavored
at
all
tastes
more
like
an
oatmeal
stout
i
made
where
the
yeast
went
wild
and
overwhelmed
the
beer
dont
need
to
have
this
again

their
skilled

wating
for
the
second
crack
before
emptying
the
75
lbs
of
hot
beans
to
air
dry
this
flavor
and
aroma
has
been
embellished
over
05
vintage
i
am
sending
a
couple
of
my
california
homebrewers
some
beans
along
with
a
cold
toddy
recipe
and
am
hoping
they
have
the
solid
oatmeal
stout
recipes
similar
to
schlaflys
to
support
the
huge
coffee
flavor
and
aroma
if
you
like
your
coffee
strong
dark
and
black
then
this
one
is
for
you
so
give
this
a
try
regardless
of
what
you
are
looking
for
in
a
beer
it
is
an
interesting
experience
worth
trying
pours

no
light

that

moderate
lacing
smells
of
a
rich
dark
coffee
and
maybe
some
roasted
malts
in
there
taste
is
where
this
beer
excels
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
dark
rich
coffee
and
a
bit
of
a
toast
taste
give
this
an
exceptional
flavor
feels
thick
rich
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
i
could
drink
these
all
day
of
the
beers
i
received
in
the
trade
from
dertbert
this
is
the
biggest
suprise
and
my
favorite
so
far
i
love
stouts
and
this
is
an
excellent
one
wow
i
dont
know
where
to
begin
with
this
beer
poured
out
the
color
of
a
very
dark
porter
not
totally
black
but
almost
a
thin
head
with
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
oatmeal
and
coffee
the
taste
is
incredible
you
first
notice
the
oatmeal
with
a
coffee
taste
left
for
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
nothing
detracts
from
this
brew
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
driving
to
st
louis
to
get
a
case
is
i
am
kinda
tired
but
i
am
thinking
of
calling
in
sick
in
the
morning
so
you
could
say
i
think
this
is
a
worthwhile
beer
i
will
cross
paths
with
this
brew
again
thanks
mjr
for
my
first
two
schlafly
brews
poured
a
dark
ruby
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
creamy
dark
brown
chocolate
head
the
nose
was
of
deep
espresso
chocolate
bitter
hop
and
malt
taste
was
predominately
the
espresso
and
the
hops
you
know
when
you
drink
a
coffee
and
towards
the
end
of
the
cup
it
becomes
kind
of
cold
and
slightly
sour
thats
what
this
tasted
like
but
good
the
taste
is
pretty
good
i
find
myself
liking
it
more
as
i
progress
through
the
glass
coffee
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
a
mild
stouty
profile
mouthfeel
is
good
even
if
it
is
a
bit
light
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
for
a
stout
especially
supposedly
made
with
oatmeal
the
body
is
amazingly
lightmedium
drinkability
is
not
bad
should
go
well
with
desserts
but
it
actually
worked
well
with
tacos
not
the
best
drinkability
or
mouthfeel
in
the
world
of
stouts
but
still
a
worthy
offering
poured
into
an
imperial

glass

the
burgundy
brown
brew
pillowy
head
fades
very
slowly
with
heavy
lacing
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
taste
seems
a
bit
light
on
the
dark
malts
and
coffee
and
a
bit
of
fruity
shines
through
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
as
hearty
as
id
look
for
in
a
stout
but
drinkability
is
still
quite
nice
not
a
bad
product
this
one
right
here
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
make
it
a
easy
drinking
american
coffee
stout
i
know
i
seemed
a
little
rough
on
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
actually
very
quaffable
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
drinkability
score
is
the
highest
one
i
just
expect
more
from
a
coffee
stout
than
this
provided
i
think
the
problem
might
be
that
the
base
stout
just
doesnt
have
the
balls
to
handle
this
assignment
i
would
like
to
see
them
try
this
again
with
a
beefier
brew
nice
and
solid
version
with
lots
of
coffee
flavors
from
mjr
thanks
bro
super
colalike
in
appearance
brown
with
a
small
white
head
that
rises
up
and
than
dies
leaving
some
nice
lacing
carbonation
is
big
bubbled
and
frothy
aromas
are
fresh
espresso
some
lightly
roasted
malts
and
maybe
some
slight
hops
the
taste
is
coffee
like
but
weakcoffee
like
with
some
roasted
coffee
notes
and
a
subtle
hoppiness
that
is
very
much
in
the
background
there
are
also
some
chocolate
notes
in
the
mix
as
well
and
maybe
some
caramel
mouthfeel
is
too
light
and
this
hurts
the
drinkability
a
little
bit
this
is
very
light
for
a
stout
and
it
almost
comes
accross
as
more
of
a
coffee
porter
id
love
to
know
the
abv
on
this
a
solidly
good
but
not
spectacular
coffeeinfused
beer
dark
brown
in
hue
blacker
in
the
middle
with
some
ruby
influences
around
the
edges
even
when
the
liquid
is
backlit
the
opaqueness
holdsup
well
the
head
was
beige
in
color
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
twofingers
in
height
the
bubbles
faded
quickly
to
a
soapy
cap
with
some
naked
spots
in
the
middle
thicker
around
the
edges
there
wasnt
much
subsequent
lacing
just
a
few
shortlived
clumps
on
the
whole
this
beer
looks
like
what
it
should
but
little
more
the
nose
is
well
coffee
iced
espresso
day
old
spend
grains
roasted
beans
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
dash
of
milklike
sweetness
wow
there
is
no
fooling
around
here
i
love
the
fact
the
potency
is
high
and
the
aromas
are
allowed
to
fully
explore
my
olfactory
for
a
coffee
stout
the
complexity
is
fairly
high
i
could
imagine
something
more
in
the
bouquet
like
a
tickle
of
hops
or
some
smoke
but
im
a
greedy
dick
for
a
beer
of
this
sort
i
really
like
what
i
smell
powerful
inviting
the
palate
is
far
less
complex
and
deep
as
the
nose
indicated
this
is
a
major
bummer
the
espresso
qualities
are
dimmer
and
the
day
old
coffee
flavors
move
into
the
forefront
this
is
always
a
worry
with
me
when
it
comes
to
coffee
stouts
it
really
needs
to
be
the
other
way
around
it
is
so
hard
to
capture
the
goodness
of
coffee
without
turning
it
into
something
that
you
find
at
the
end
of
a
day
at
a
quickie
mart
you
know
stale
coffee
the
acidity
from
the
roast
is
way
too
naked
their
needs
to
be
more
sweetness
malt
depth
andor
hop
bitterness
the
palate
lacks
roundness
it
is
too
sharp
where
is
the
harmony
plus
the
fact
the
body
is
so
small
this
really
hurts
the
development
of
the
palate
onedimensional
boring
straightforward
you
get
the
point
right
it
is
not
sophisticated
enough
to
pair
with
dessert
mediumlight
in
body
the
carbonation
is
firm
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lousy
there
needs
to
be
way
more
body
to
make
this
beer
work
skinny
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
spilker
ales
xpo
espresso
stout
rip
that
is
too
bad
because
that
beer
had
some
flaws
as
does
this
one
sure
it
is
drinkable
but
im
bored
with
it
and
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
thankfully
i
only
had
one
bottle
this
was
purchased
at
the
tap
room
in
st
louis
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixpack
i
say
skip
it
i
had
one
of
the
best
coffee
and
beer
combinations
ever
it
was
red
hooks
double
espresso
stout
and
it
is
miles
above
what
tom
schlafly
is
calling
a
coffee
stout
the
smell
of
coffee
is
vaguely
present
i
often
use
the
toddy
method
to
brew
my
morning
coffee
and
it
is
a
great
method
the
method
is
wasted
in
this
brew
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
sixpack
but
i
live
in
st
louis
and
grabbed
a
six
as
soon
as
it
came
available
at
my
local
mega
mart
the
brew
had
decent
color
but
the
nose
was
sour
the
taste
spicy
in
a
puckering
kinda
way
and
the
finish
was
lackluster
in
summary
still
nice
however
although
in
theory
the
melding
of
my
two
loves
coffee
and
beer
should
be
an
easy
winner
it
works
less
well
in
practise
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
head
the
head
fades
somewhat
quickly
leaving
few
laces
as
soon
as
the
beer
is
poured
you
are
assulted
by
a
very
strong
coffee
aroma
hidden
is
a
malty
aroma
but
the
coffee
aroma
is
dominant
it
tastes
very
coffee
like
i
guess
that
is
because
it
is
a
coffee
stout
it
tastes
just
like
cold
coffee
with
alcohol
it
is
very
impressive
other
coffee
stouts
only
have
a
mild
coffee
flavor
but
this
one
has
very
strong
flavors
it
leaves
a
coffee
taste
in
the
mouth
it
is
rather
pleasent
it
is
carbonated
just
right
this
beer
would
be
a
great
session
beer
it
is
very
tasty
and
it
doesnt
have
too
much
alcohol
if
i
could
get
this
beer
where
i
live
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
the
rating
it
has
doesnt
give
it
justice
wow
what
a
dessert
er
beer
the
pour
looks
just
like
the
oatmeal
stout
but
you
can
barely
detect
the
coffee
under
the
malt
chocolate
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
outstanding
you
start
with
the
oatmeal
stout
and
then
finish
with
an
enjoyable
cappuccino
flavor
drinkability
is
a
paradox
the
first
one
and
then
the
second
were
outstanding

then
its
like
a
2nd
pumpkin
ale
or
a
dessert
it
starts
to
become
overwhelming
would
be
a
great
after
dinner
finishing
beer
poured
a
dark
dark
karo
syrup
brown
with
garnet
highlights
head
tan
and
fine
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
good
roast
coffee
very
faint
hops
if
any
the
taste
is
delicious
coffee
and
chocolate
no
harsh
bitterness
just
the
right
amount
to
meet
the
style
a
little
thin
on
the
mouth
feel
but
a
nice
finish
extremely
drinkable
dark
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
a
massive
blast
of
coffee
beans
on
the
nose
a
comparison
to
walking
into
a
crowded
coffee
shop
where
everyone
is
drinking
dark
roasted
java
ok
coffee
beans
noted
up
front
espresso
burnt
malts
pretty
creamy
and
just
a
bit
dry
a
bit
of
a
watery
palate
yet
there
is
a
full
mouthfeel
with
the
feeling
of
fresh
brewed
java
on
the
tongue
coffee
dominated
all
the
way
i
need
to
know
right
now

youre
in
or
youre
out
im
in
the
folks
at
schlafly
have
once
again
delivered
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
offering
but
id
like
to
see
more
aroma
in
the
presentation
still
id
go
for
it
again
and
again
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
has
a
nice
big
creamy
light
brown
head
strong
roasted
coffee
aroma
huge
coffee
flavor
in
this
one
almost
overpowering
but
very
tasty
full
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
beautiful
burnt
bitterness
if
you
like
strong
coffee
you
will
like
this
i
love
it
a
fantastic
blend
of
schlafly
stout
and
local
coffeebar
favorite
kaldis
coffee
probably
better
than
the
red
hook
starbucks
combo
if
nothing
else
than
its
all
local
a
distinctive
brew
though
not
without
its
detractors
i
for
one
love
it
a
decent
rep
of
the
style
your
basic
oatmeal
stout
this
is
my
first
experience
with
schlafly
beer
i
will
be
buying
more
its
alright
not
bad
but
the
coffee
stout
gives
a
little
better
flavor
than
the
blandness
than
the
regular
oatmeal
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
had
everything
i
wanted
in
an
oatmeal
stout
very
dark
and
hits
of
cocoa
its
a
very
dark
and
rich
stout
that
has
a
smooth
finish
price
point
212
oz
single
o
an
easy
drinking
middle
of
the
road
oatmeal
stout
good
beer
that
pours
a
decent
12
to
34
in
head
and
produces
pretty
good
lacing
beautiful
deep
chocolate
color
that
is
very
hard
to
see
through
aroma
is
very
light
taste
is
good
and
this
is
one
of
the
more
criper
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
there
is
a
nice
maltyraisin
taste
and
a
great
crisp
carbonated
finish
not
as
creamy
as
other
stouts
but
unique
in
its
own
way
and
very
very
drinkable
solid
attempt
at
the
classic
style
solid
drinkable
beer
that
lacks
the
creamy
sweetness
of
the
very
best
oatmeal
stouts
big
fan
of
the
dry
finish
though
great
classic
oatmeal
stout
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
for
am
oatmeal
stout
overall
while
this
is
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
i
have
ever
had
it
is
certainly
a
quality
product
i
would
absolutely
recommend
this
product
to
anyone
condor
recommended
and
approved
o
not
bad
i
would
buy
this
again
enjoyed
at
the
st
louis
airport
the
beer
was
on
par
with
most
oatmeal
stouts
nice
body
in
the
glass
with
the
usual
full
aroma
the
beer
held
up
well
in
the
mouth
and
had
some
depth
and
body
to
it
nothing
special
in
the
taste
that
makes
it
stand
out
against
other
stouts
though
a
good
but
not
great
oatmeal
stout
nice
flavor
but
misses
a
tad
on
the
feel
and
aroma
o
this
is
a
very
decent
stout
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
and
noticed
it
was
8
months
old
bravo
to
schlafly
for
prominently
and
easily
labeling
their
beers
right
on
the
label
but
i
took
a
chance
on
it
because
i
loved
their
coffee
stout
this
is
decent
not
the
same
caliber
as
the
coffee
stout
but
a
solid
offering
overall
4
00
all
together
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
be
a
return
customer
even
with
my
distaste
of
the
initial
mouthfeel
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
overall
its
not
exciting
decent
flavor
nothing
offensive
bottle
poured
a
black
color
ale
with
a
rather
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
rich
roasted
malt
notes
with
a
side
of
black
chocolates
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
roasted
malt
with
a
side
of
black
chocolate
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
well
enjoyable
with
good
balance
between
the
flavours
and
good
drinkability
o
i
must
finally
be
going
over
the
deep
end
because
this
is
far
smokier
than
i
remember
thats
not
a
bad
thing
i
like
schlenkerlas
rauchbiers
and
i
like
some
good
bbq
pulled
pork
oddly
enough
the
only
instance
i
enjoy
pork
products
but
this
beer
is
striking
my
palate
too
strangely
to
be
a
great
oatmeal
stout
as
a
result
its
hard
for
me
to
return
to
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
is
perhaps
too
sweet
for
my
liking
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
a
clean
heavy
mouthfeel
this
is
my
first
schlafly
beer
and
am
ready
to
try
some
more
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
a
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
and
probably
worth
purchasing
again
the
oatmeal
is
evident
in
the
aroma
flavor
and
soft
feel
hints
of
dried
fruits
and
faint
coffee
add
to
the
flavor
which
is
as
expected
dominated
by
roasted
grains
no
burnt
grain
low
hops
and
carbonation
full
bodied
oa
pretty
tasty
stout
o
3
0
yea
its
pretty
bad
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
is
pretty
standard
for
missouri
beer
good
beer
law
state
just
not
good
beers
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
cocoa
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
then
some
dense
bread
then
some
smoked
wood
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
in
the
finish
pretty
good
mouthfeel
overall
quite
a
good
oatmeal
stout
i
would
get
this
again
i
wish
i
had
another
o
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
that
doesnt
really
play
up
any
oatmeal
characteristics
its
a
little
creamier
and
more
substantial
thankfully
but
i
dont
get
it
anywhere
else
still
a
fine
and
pleasant
stout
for
any
occasion
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
nutty
with
an
almost
coffeelike
roastiness
with
slight
yeasty
and
vegetal
aspect
which
is
okay
with
some
toasted
notes
from
the
malt
in
the
background
and
light
spice
from
the
hops
i
am
assuming
the
flavor
has
a
bitterness
of
roasted
grain
with
slight
vegetal
creaminess
with
more
burnt
malt
flavor
lasting
into
the
finish
the
flavor
is
good
with
some
light
cocoa
on
the
tongue
near
the
last
taste
adding
a
nice
depth
to
the
combination
of
malt
and
yeast
flavors
overall
this
is
pretty
decent
actually
it
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
with
nice
layering
and
even
though
it
is
a
little
more
carbonated
than
most
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
the
roast
level
is
pretty
spot
on
without
becoming
too
much
by
the
end
of
the
glass
black
in
color
and
not
much
light
will
penetrate
it
minimal
brussels
lace
at
the
top
of
the
glass
i
smell
oatmeal
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
viscous
with
a
bit
of
dryness
tastes
strongly
of
roasted
malt
and
oatmeal
leaving
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
nice
roast
character
with
cocolate
bitterness
moderate
stingy
carbonation
takes
away
from
some
of
the
smoothness
i
was
hoping
for
all
in
all
good
but
not
great
pours
dark
dark
brown
and
with
chestnut
highlights
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
touch
of
ruby
in
there
too
nose
is
weak
overall
bitter
coffee
burnt
sugar
light
char
glimpse
of
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
faint
chocolate
and
oats
maybe
some
salted
peanut
taste
is
slightly
metallic
up
front
body
is
thin
and
watery
my
first
thought
is
this
is
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
has
no
depth
or
creaminess
travels
the
palate
way
too
quickly
follows
the
nose
with
weak
flavor
of
coffee
chocolate
and
the
fruit
has
disappeared
malt
is
weak
and
although
this
has
balance
it
is
lacking
in
intensity
and
depth
theres
a
hop
bitter
mid
palate
that
settles
in
back
and
without
it
there
would
be
hardly
any
aftertaste
except
for
the
raw
oat
taste
and
a
salted
peanut
flavor
i
think
this
has
potential
but
it
just
isnt
finished
yet
it
needs
some
tweaking
this
needs
a
more
solid
backbone
with
more
char
more
chocolate
and
more
character
it
is
tasty
though
overall
this
is
a
major
disappointment
this
oatmeal
stout
is
acidic
not
very
sweet
and
quite
unbalanced
would
not
get
this
again
the
mouthfeel
and
roast
stand
out
on
the
beer
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
overall
a
nice
pretty
basic
oatmeal
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
overall
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
lots
of
roast
and
chocolate
and
a
great
mouthfeel
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
o
a
pretty
good
stout
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
but
a
good
above
average
stout
i
would
defiantly
pick
this
one
up
again
o
a
good
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
stands
out
and
probably
not
something
i
would
persue
again
with
better
options
out
there
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
stout
but
no
a
great
one
overall
not
my
favorite
stout
but
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
in
the
future
overall
interesting
beer
which
has
some
flavors
that
are
unfamiliar
to
me
especially
for
the
style
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
that
is
typical
of
its
style
i
have
a
fondness
for
the
schlafly
brand
in
general
but
will
want
to
redrink
this
beer
the
next
time
i
make
it
to
st
louis
o
i
probably
first
had
this
stout
10
years
ago
brings
back
memories
solid
stout
and
tastes
as
good
as
ever
oas
it
warms
though
it
starts
to
go
awry
roastedburnt
seems
to
overpower
it
still
is
a
good
stout
though
o
pretty
good
beer
its
not
outstanding
but
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
o
i
wouldnt
rank
this
as
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
it
is
definitely
note
worthy
and
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future
o
this
beer
has
been
better
in
the
past
for
sure
not
sure
if
its
a
bad
batch
or
the
recipe
has
changed
but
i
wasnt
digging
this
one
as
much
as
i
had
in
the
past
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
midlevel
carbonation
that
feels
soft
on
the
palate
but
still
manages
to
foam
this
up
slightly
the
result
is
a
satisfyingly
creamy
and
smooth
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
crispness
would
be
a
bit
better
if
just
slightly
heavier
in
body
but
still
above
average
o
a
decent
stout
overall
would
have
liked
a
little
higher
abv
as
well
as
more
fragrance
and
flavor
o
decent
oatmeal
stout
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
o
schlafly
is
my
favorite
brewery
they
do
everything
well
and
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
picked
up
a
sixer
of
schlafly
oatmeal
stout
at
my
local
stateline
beer
store
for
just
under
eight
bucks
the
brew
date
is
a
year
old
and
its
not
been
kept
refrigerated
as
the
bottle
instructs
it
pours
black
with
lots
of
thick
foamy
head
which
leaves
copious
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
vanilla
and
flavor
is
a
little
harsh
its
not
as
smooth
and
balanced
as
id
hoped
still
a
good
solid
stout
but
not
as
refined
as
i
expected
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
o
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
from
a
brewery
that
has
developed
a
reputation
for
producing
solid
nofrills
beers
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
but
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
buy
it
again
recommended
12oz
bottle
from
picks
poured
into
a
shaker
pours
black
with
a
half
finger
of
tan
head
aroma
of
light
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
light
bitter
mostly
coffee
with
a
little
chocolate
and
some
caramel
medium
bodied
with
a
surprisingly
thin
texture
lively
carbonation
and
a
decently
long
finish
overall
not
too
bad
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
but
this
one
is
darn
good
for
the
price
all
in
all
an
ok
beer
a
nice
routine
oatmeal
stout
thats
saved
from
forgettability
by
the
sharpenss
of
the
bittering
pretty
good
beer
o
average
at
best
overall
impression
great
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
many
times
in
bottle
but
never
on
tap
ill
be
enjoying
the
coffee
stout
by
schlafly
very
soon
as
well
go
for
this
if
you
enjoy
a
nice
roasty
stout
with
good
oaty
and
grainy
attributes
dont
order
if
your
looking
for
a
medium
bodied
brew
or
anything
less
than
mediumfull
could
be
substituted
for
a
meal
overall
im
a
bit
disappointed
ive
had
and
loved
schlaflys
coffee
stout
but
the
oatmeal
stout
isnt
cutting
it
for
me
there
just
isnt
much
to
it
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
its
very
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
and
charred
in
a
way
that
i
dont
like
not
my
favorite
rich
and
thick
oh
so
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
on
cask
anything
from
here
is
always
recommended
especially
if
its
on
cask
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
coming
out
of
the
bottle
after
it
settles
it
looks
like
black
coffee
in
the
glass
a
foamy
dark
cream
colored
head
sits
on
top
the
head
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
with
random
bubbles
but
by
the
end
theres
hardly
anything
sticky
lacing
its
hard
to
get
a
bead
on
the
aroma
bitter
chocolate
is
present
it
tastes
of
bitter
chocolate
burnt
malts
and
maybe
a
hint
of
oats
its
not
all
that
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
its
just
too
watery
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
im
not
overly
impressed
with
schlaflys
offerings
except
their
pumpkin
ale
this
is
definitely
an
oatmeal
stout
i
will
never
revisit
dark
and
rich
and
chocolaty
and
robust
and
delicious
this
pours
a
beautiful
dark
thick
brown
with
a
full
2
inch
head
into
a
frosted
mug
heavy
roasted
aroma
that
smells
a
little
sweet
almost
decadent
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
miss
the
body
tastes
great
this
is
the
best
schlafly
beer
i
have
had
a
little
bit
of
espresso
in
the
finish
bittersweet
nice
o
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
sessionable
for
sure
sweet
but
not
cloying
just
enough
balance
noticeable
a
very
respectable
oatmeal
stout
d
taste
and
flavor
are
a
bit
lacking
its
enjoyable
but
i
think
schlaflys
coffee
stout
is
their
better
stout
overall
i
would
have
liked
this
to
be
a
little
bit
smoother
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
search
out
another
m
medium
body
with
a
creamy
texture
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
balanced
but
boring
aftertaste
comparable
with
their
porter
although
i
like
that
one
a
bit
more
still
a
solid
everyday
beer
dark
brown
nature
nearly
opaque
with
a
nice
head
of
dark
tan
that
rose
up
to
around
an
inch
before
settling
back
down
nice
lacing
along
the
sides
fades
quickly
aroma
is
of
deep
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
caramel
and
a
light
chocolate
note
that
seems
to
build
with
time
nice
touches
of
vanilla
balancing
in
here
now
as
well
clean
flavor
nothing
rough
about
it
at
all
as
the
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
really
take
over
the
profile
and
provide
a
very
smooth
and
very
even
feel
to
it
warm
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
o
again
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
amazing
for
the
style
which
i
thoroughly
enjoy
another
nice
offering
from
schlafly
glad
i
picked
up
some
of
their
beers
on
my
last
out
of
state
beer
trip
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
it
every
day
cheers
overall
a
respectable
offering
but
its
not
going
to
blow
you
away
especially
since
we
are
now
in
the
season
of
founders
breakfast
stout
still
good
though
cheers
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
but
a
nice
stout
nothing
great
nice
glass
of
good
basic
stout
serving
type
bottle
poured
this
oatmeal
stout
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
stout
pours
a
hazy
blackish
brown
color
and
produces
a
nice
tan
head
retention
is
great
and
it
leaves
ample
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
contains
sweet
oats
and
malt
some
suggestions
of
vanilla
this
ale
is
medium
in
body
the
front
end
of
the
ale
contains
roasted
malt
sweet
and
a
very
slight
piney
hop
note
overall
this
is
an
average
oatmeal
stout
their
coffee
version
of
this
ale
is
much
better
o
i
expect
an
oatmeal
stout
to
have
a
full
body
with
a
very
evident
silky
creaminess
to
it
and
an
evident
base
sweetness
this
meets
my
expectations
only
partway
it
tasted
sweeter
and
creamier
on
tap
so
i
give
the
tap
version
a
full
grade
higher
than
the
bottle
o
i
like
this
beer
a
good
deal
and
am
happy
it
has
found
its
way
into
the
nashville
market
o
its
around
average
for
me
the
flavors
are
good
but
its
a
stout
made
with
oatmeal
hard
to
beat
that
the
head
and
mouthfeel
are
huge
with
this
and
it
missed
by
a
mile
overall
great
mouthfeel
and
restrained
roast
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
complexity
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
o
this
stout
leaves
much
to
be
desired
i
am
not
sure
if
my
palate
is
used
to
something
ore
over
the
topkick
in
the
face
or
not
but
i
would
not
purchase
again
i
really
have
liked
what
schlafly
has
done
with
their
stouts
outside
of
their
barrel
aged
one
i
have
to
say
i
need
to
buy
more
of
their
brews
if
theyre
going
to
keep
doing
such
great
work
overall
it
is
a
decent
brew
i
get
more
brown
ale
then
oaty
stout
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
reasonable
price
7
99
a
sixer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
nice
balance
good
flavor
good
feel
i
recommend
it
overall
not
as
big
of
a
beer
as
some
of
its
darker
brethren
but
a
great
beer
overall
it
is
more
complex
than
beers
of
a
similar
price
and
if
you
are
after
a
sweet
and
toasty
brew
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
schaflys
oatmeal
stout
i
recommend
it
superb
and
very
enjoyable
and
the
taste
and
complexity
improved
as
my
ale
glass
warmed
to
room
temperature
d
leaves
an
unfortunate
chalky
taste
the
more
you
sip
really
makes
this
just
a
mediumbodied
stout
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
small
snifter
it
pours
opaque
w
some
red
tint
has
a
slightly
tan
head
w
poor
lacing
the
head
goes
away
quickly
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
however
this
is
a
little
low
for
me
theres
a
slight
acidic
bite
restrained
hop
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
coffeeish
roasted
malt
some
espresso
notes
not
as
smooth
as
expected
taking
into
account
the
flakes
used
to
make
this
style
its
quite
reserved
but
a
decent
stout
a
slight
lingering
finish
has
a
good
hop
taste
to
it
medium
body
pretty
drinkable
i
wish
it
were
more
assertive
that
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
setting
prosit
overall
doesnt
really
seem
all
that
true
to
style
being
a
bit
too
light
in
body
and
having
more
bitterness
than
expected
dont
get
the
expected
silkiness
in
mouthfeel
bit
of
a
disappointment
d
drinkable
but
im
unlikely
to
get
more
of
this
d
good
drinkability
for
me
i
would
buy
this
again
as
with
most
offerings
from
schafelys
d
i
goes
down
easy
enough
i
wouldnt
put
it
up
there
with
sam
smiths
but
its
decent
well
carbonated
with
with
a
light
to
medium
somewhat
airy
mouthfeel
d
this
is
overall
a
mediocre
oatmeal
stout
i
think
some
more
oatmeal
would
really
help
this
beer
out
significantly
trying
to
pick
out
something
worthwhile
on
this
one
hidden
in
the
back
with
the
char
is
slightly
sweet
banana
note
doesnt
redeem
this
mess
this
one
pours
looking
just
like
a
coke
with
lesser
carbonation
and
a
cream
colored
head
this
bottle
is
over
a
year
old
so
the
smell
is
pretty
dull
its
got
some
light
roasted
maltiness
to
it
with
a
little
sweetness
and
slight
alcohol
it
tastes
pretty
standard
its
not
very
rich
but
has
the
light
coffee
appeal
of
a
stout
and
has
some
breadiness
to
it
as
well
it
drinks
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smoothly
its
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
too
special
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
is
thin
and
not
too
longlasting
the
nose
is
roasted
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
roasted
malt
pervades
the
taste
as
well
with
mild
coffee
notes
good
creamy
body
with
really
nice
carbonation
a
bit
plain
but
pretty
drinkable
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
the
downplay
in
the
flavor
helps
to
this
and
reminds
me
of
the
next
step
above
guinness
the
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
make
this
beer
sessionable
to
the
average
drinker
and
beyond
drinkability
high
for
a
stoutwhere
its
lighterwetter
mouth
body
hut
it
in
some
ways
that
does
make
it
an
easy
job
to
have
a
few
pounding
3
watching
a
ball
game
on
a
hot
st
louis
night
probably
could
replace
a
lager
or
pale
in
that
role
could
be
an
entry
level
for
friends
not
used
to
a
bigrobust
brew
reasonable
price
flawed
yet
may
have
a
niche
seemed
to
fall
a
bit
short
on
the
creamy
study
notes
that
oatmeal
lends
to
a
stout
pleasant
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
with
no
particular
notes
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
finish
was
a
hint
of
astringency
overall
a
pleasant
but
unengaging
beer
drinkability
meh
not
especially
appealing
or
pleasing
to
my
tastes
but
one
could
certainly
drink
it
without
much
to
worry
about
just
not
something
that
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
however
let
it
be
known
that
schlafly
has
still
been
a
very
reliable
brewery
for
me
and
i
will
still
have
no
problems
picking
up
their
other
beers
as
i
go
poured
from
a
bottle
brewed
on
71510
into
a
pint
glass
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
but
this
is
my
first
time
to
review
pours
black
with
just
a
touch
of
light
peeking
through
not
much
lacing
aroma
and
flavors
are
sweet
with
oats
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
abv
and
mouthfeel
combine
to
make
this
a
drinkable
stout
i
never
have
a
problem
finishing
2
or
3
of
these
in
a
sitting
all
said
one
of
my
favorites
from
schlafly
cheers
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malts
that
give
a
very
dry
brownie
a
cocoa
nuance
the
front
is
dry
while
the
finish
is
smooth
and
syrupy
that
said
its
pretty
quaffable
for
the
style
d
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
pretty
bland
for
the
style
d
i
find
this
good
for
a
couple
after
a
long
day
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
trying
tasting
a
fair
amount
of
oatmeal
as
this
warms
up
definitely
quite
quaffable
id
get
this
again
as
a
sessionable
stout
i
liked
the
beer
but
am
not
a
fan
of
stouts
probably
a
pounder
of
a
stout
thats
a
better
value
than
guinness
keeper
d
not
much
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
just
kills
it
for
me
if
this
beer
was
beefed
up
a
bit
with
less
carbonation
it
would
be
much
better
smells
of
roasted
malts
some
faint
coffee
and
chocolate
no
real
hop
smell
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
light
roasted
malt
flavor
some
bitter
coffee
or
bittersweet
chocolate
come
through
more
coffee
flavor
comes
out
at
the
end
once
it
has
warmed
a
bit
good
mouthfeel
but
not
as
thick
and
rich
as
i
was
expecting
closer
to
a
dry
stout
in
body
and
finish
moderate
level
of
carbonation
keep
it
smooth
dry
finish
overall
this
is
ok
but
i
have
had
better
d
nice
brew
not
as
thick
and
creamy
as
guiness
a
strong
coffee
chocolate
character
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
given
its
faults
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
good
enough
to
enjoy
more
than
once
pretty
satisfying
conclusion
love
me
some
schlafly
and
some
of
their
beers
are
damn
good
this
one
though
is
just
a
bit
uninspired
and
averageish
not
bad
just
not
special
it
was
a
bit
betterricher
on
tap
at
the
bottleworks
d
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
ive
tried
too
bad
its
not
available
local
drinkability
well
this
was
a
really
nice
treat
not
sure
why
this
one
is
scoring
so
low
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
hitting
most
of
the
highlights
without
making
any
huge
missteps
the
relatively
low
abv
enhances
the
drinkability
a
little
further
too
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
one
of
these
on
a
friday
after
work
or
with
a
nice
earthy
cheese
or
a
grilled
veggie
kabob
or
two
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
was
good
drinks
great
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
low
powered
here
for
my
taste
but
it
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
has
been
my
go
too
for
english
style
stouts
the
nose
and
flavor
are
wonderful
roasted
coffee
aroma
with
no
hop
character
dark
brown
black
color
but
very
crisp
caramel
malt
is
evidenced
with
some
bitterness
from
dark
malts
hop
bitterness
becomes
more
evident
on
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
to
cleanse
the
palate
not
a
big
stout
very
balanced
grain
bill
as
the
dark
malts
do
not
dominate
the
palate
this
isnt
your
normal
stout
poured
a
dark
brown
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
smells
wonderful
just
like
opening
a
package
of
oatmeal
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
tasted
of
roasted
malt
with
a
bitter
finish
had
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
which
is
what
leaves
it
from
being
voted
higher
poures
black
with

smells
a

with
a

also

is
nice
and
full
bodied
nice
roasted
barley
flavor
with
a
good
dosing
of
oatmeal
that
comes
through
nicely
and
finishes
just
a
bit
sweet
and
with
a
touch
of
hops
to
even
things
out
wonderful
med
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
a
really
god
oatmeal
stout
that
is
better
than
most
overall
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
schlafly
has
plenty
of
better
offerings
still
worth
a
shot
dark

not
quite

nothing
fancy
but
i
like
it
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
i
forgot
how
much
i
liked
it
it
is
a
very
rich
and
creamy
beer
which
makes
for
smooth
drinking
a
nice
example
of
what
a
stout
should
be

a
slight
sweetness

it

it
wouldve
been
a
little
deeper

those
goes
down
very
smooth
a
very
well
brewed
oatmeal
stout
i
picked
up
a
mixed
six
pack
at
a
liquour
store
while
visiting
my
brother
in
law
i
had
regretted
not
stopping
at
schlafly
while
in
st
louis
last
summer
and
after
trying
this
i
regretted
it
even
more
black
in
color
with
wispy
lacing
on
the
surface
after
being
poured
into
a
pint
glass
mild
oatmeal
and
coffee

rich

flavor
smoky
coffee
attack
creamy
finish
mild
smoke
aftertaste
very
pleasant
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
it
pours
an
initially
large
head
which
dissipates
pretty
smooth
taste
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
the
smell
is
decent
i
would
have
liked
to
find
more
of
the
caramel
in
terms
of
smell
and
taste
though
still
pretty
easy
to
recommend
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
bit
of
red
around
the
edges
produces
a
nice
sized
head
leaving
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
a
hint
of
chocolate
caramel
and
of
the
roasted
barley
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
the
roasted
taste
comes
out
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
not
as
thick
as
i
was
expecting
but
at
least
its
smooth
overall
its
not
bad
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
but
at
least
its
pretty
drinkable
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
available
but
it
does
a
decent
job
although
alot
of
seasonal
stuff
is
out
for
spring
time
and
i
regret
not
getting
some
of
that
one
of
the
hoppier
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
accentuated
by
some
toasty
malt
notes
and
rather
high
carbonation
roasty
chocolate
flavors
get
lost
a
bit
and
the
body
is
pretty
thin
but
overall
this
was
an
easy
drinking
oaty
stout
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again

feel

strong

of
roasted

hops
are
noticeable
in
the
background
an

flavor
is
present
next
and
the
finish
is
a
smooth
roasted
malt
flavor
overall
i
rather
enjoy
the
smoke
flavors
and
the
complexity
of
the
palate
this
is
another
fine
beer
from
schlafly
and
worth
the
try
via
mphopkins99
beer
served
a
deep
dark
brown
slight
mahogany
hue
to
it
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
that
may
have
been
from
the
bartenders
pour
what
was
there
was
a
tan
slightly
more
than
film
that
lingered
not
much

speak
of
nose
is
of
rich
caramel
malts
along
with
some
roasted
malts
and
bit
of
nut
taste
is
very
roasted
at
first
sip
roasted
malts
definitely
appear
first
there
are
some
hints
of
coffee
and
leaves
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
not
too
heavy
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
again
due
to
the
meager
alcohol
and
mouthfeel
with
muted
flavors
you
could
probably
drink
a
case
of
this
stuff
but
i
wont
because
its
not
that
good
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
but
so
is
coors
original
and
im
not
out
buying
that
today
this
embodies
all
the
qualities
of
your
average
stout
except
for
that
strange
aftertaste
i
dont
love
stouts
this
is
no
exception
hard
for
me
to
drink
this
with
the
wide
varitey
of
this
style
im
not
sure
that
this
would
be
the
1st
i
went
for
but
overall
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
one
for
someone
starting
out
in
this
area

a
doubt

cheers
dpretty
minimal
aftertaste
alcohol
is
a
little
present
and
warming
the
taste
is
fantastic
but
the
heavy
body
is
a
bit
prohibitive
overall
a
terrible
beer
hopefully
this
was
a
bad
bottle
instead
of
their
intention
avoid
one
and
done
id
try
again
just
to
see
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
if
i
found
in
someone
elses
fridge
for
me
id
never
buy
again
i
gave
this
one
above
average
drinkability
mainly
because
of
the
mouthfeel
and
sweeter
taste
d
not
too
bad
ill
try
this
one
again
and
update
my
numbers
if
needed
pours
a
red
black
brown
color
body
looks
like
a
flat
cola
with
a
tannish
head
oatmeal
coffee
aroma
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
too
effervescent
coffee
taste
some
liquor
taste
like
whiskey
watery
taste
almost
like
a
porter
but
it
does
have
that
taste
of
a
stout
almost
some
bitter
chocolate
taste
maybe
some
oatmeal
in
the
taste
too
drinkability
comes
up
a
bit
short
both
in
terms
of
flavor
and
body
soso
at
bast
easily
drinkable
on
a
cold
and
snowy
night
like
tonight
done
of
the
better
tasting
beers
from
this
brewery
from
a
brown
12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
root
beer

color
with
a
slight
head
and
average
carbonation
smells
of
roasted
malts

with
a
little
alcohol
coming
through

sip
is
sweet
then
quickly
bitter
some
nutty
flavor
notes
present
very
light
bodied
decent
mouthfeel
but
a
tad
under
carbonated
not
too
bad
d
stouts
are
my
favorite
definately
have
several
more
to
drink
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stouts
this
has
been
my
go
to
stout
when
i
cant
make
up
my
mind
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
which
is
easydrinking
but
lacks
the
richness
of
flavor
that
makes
the
style
so
appealing
could
be
much
better
d
very
smooth
for
a
stout
i
could
drink
several
of
these
sampled
at
the
tap
room
just
as
it
should
be
damnit
poured
off
the
tap
a
dark
brown
like
coca
cola
not
quite
black
because
sunlight
still
passes
through
it
tan
head
about
a
finger
thick
displays
good
retention
and
some
broken
lacing
aromas
are
a
little
light
for
such
a
heavy
looking
brew
roasted
malts
and
bakers
chocolate
with
a
slight
hint
of
vinegar
the
flavors
were
equally
taut
bitter
coffee
caramel
with
a
milk
chocolate
finish
when
the
malts
balance
out
malts
are
a
little
chalky
though
medium
body
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
the
carbonation
is
light
which
gives
it
a
creamy
feel
it
feels
off
balance
to
me
and
lacks
gumption
and
heft
wheres
the
winter
deflecting
chutzpah
get
on
st
louis
and
keep
me
posted
dthe
pleasant
flavours
rescues
this
one
from
being
sub
standard
body
profile
could
use
a
bit
of
beefing
up
decent
overall
but
not
one
i
would
reach
for
over
and
over
again
d
i
enjoyed
it
a
nice
drinking
oatmeal
stout
not
bad
for
a
oatmeal
stout
and
i
say
it
about
average
in
its
drinkability
da
possible
everyday
drinker
smooth
and
flavorful
with
a
good
price
very
enjoyable
look
foward
to
the
second
showing
pours
dark
dark
brown
not
quite
pitch
black
with
ruby
hints
around
the
edges
the
head
is
small
but
dense
and
dissipates
to
a
swirl
on
the
top
leaving
sporadic
lacing
the
smell
has
some
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
cocoa
with
a
big
oatmeal
presence
on
top
the
taste
has
a
little
more
complexity
than
the
smell
with
a
larger
presence
of
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malts
the
oatmeal
is
still
present
in
the
taste
just
not
as
dominant
as
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
as
stouts
go
with
good
carbonation
the
oatmeal
leaves
the
finish
a
little
dry
and
bitter
but
not
too
bad
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
though
its
not
the
most
complex
or
tasty
example
ive
had
still
recommended
a
nice
solid
example
of
its
style
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
nothing
really
stands
out
here
to
make
me
want
another
i
am
going
to
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
because
it
tastes
good
but
i
am
ultimately
going
to
forget
out
it
in
the
long
run
i
expected
something
completely
different
from
this
one
if
this
wasnt
labeled
oatmeal
stout
it
would
be
a
solid
brew
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
at
all
name
aside
its
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
good
session
brew
drinkability
is
good
for
a
stout
not
heavy
at
all
but
yet
flavorful
this
could
be
an
everyday
stout
if
i
lived
in
the
midwest
but
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
say
black
butte
porter
if
it
were
offered
out
west
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
good
oatmeal
stout
as
far
as
im
concerned
and
this
one
isnt
bad
at
all
d
an
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
this
is
good
carbonation
full
body
smooth
great
beer
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
good
oatmeal
stout
d
this
is
an
okay
oatmeal
stout
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
basically
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
light
to
moderate
smell
of
dark
roasty
malt
a
hint
of
coffee
and
almost
a
light
skunk
smell
in
the
background
taste
is
semi
dry
char
roast
malt
and
it
has
an
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
a
touch
thin
in
the
body
however
a
lingering
ashy
charred
smokiness
rather
than
the
oaty
creaminess
i
expected
not
bad
and
an
interesting
oatmeal
stout
notes
my
first
oatmeal
stout
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
i
still
liked
it
its
kind
of
funny
to
me
that
this
style
of
stout
is
sweeter
than
any
sweet
stout
ive
ever
tired
a
sweet
mild
stout
that
tastes
pretty
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
id
reccomend
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
it
is
easy
to
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
ive
had
it
on
tap
a
couple
of
times
and
in
bottle
not
the
best
stout
by
any
means
but
definitely
not
the
worst
d
definitely
very
drinkable
it
did
fill
me
up
pretty
quickly
after
a
couple
i
was
feeling
pretty
full
like
i
said
before
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
taste
out
of
it
but
i
think
it
was
worth
buying
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
of
those
burnt
malts
not
bad
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
purchase
it
if
i
saw
it
hey
schlafly
can
we
get
a
little
distrabution
in
northeast
iowa
please
very
mild
roast
to
the
aroma
too
subdued
for
my
taste
mild
bitterness
on
the
end
with
a
subtle
roast
malt
middle
light
feeling
not
too
thin
or
watery
oatmeal
isnt
a
major
contributor
in
the
body
its
light
enough
to
session
bu
ti
moved
on
to
something
else
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
beautifully
a
rich
dark
brown
when
pouring
turns
into
a
deep
brownblack
color
in
the
glass
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
the
thin
head
but
whatre
you
going
to
do
smells
like
sweet
roasted
grains
and
coffee
a
decent
taste
that
starts
sweet
and
ends
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
impressive
nice
and
bubbly
for
a
stout
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
not
my
favorite
its
not
difficult
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
backtoback
but
i
wouldnt
be
interested
not
enough
about
this
grabs
me
im
far
from
compelled
to
grab
another
decent
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
mediocre
compared
to
many
other
stoutssamuel
smiths
for
starters
then
again
arent
most
sample
at
the
lambert
st
louis
airport
location
the
beer
is
a
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
light
beige
head
that
burns
off
slowly
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
milk
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
mocha
mediumbodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
malt
chocolate
and
grain
flavors
with
traces
of
hops
and
coffee
the
finish
remains
smooth
bordering
on
watery
actually
and
sweet
with
a
lingering
sweetness
above
average
overall
pours
a
dark
molasses
brown
with
a
big
two
finger
fluffy
khaki
colored
head
stickiness
leaves
its
marks
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
somewhat
spotty
but
good
smell
is
well
bad
metallic
odor
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
not
the
combination
im
looking
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
maybe
theres
some
hops
in
the
nose
too
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
taste
is
a
bit
of
smokiness
with
some
sweet
toasted
oat
flavors
some
interesting
pine
flavors
seem
to
make
an
appearance
midway
through
which
are
a
bit
disturbing
aftertaste
has
a
hint
of
woody
vanilla
with
a
bit
of
earthy
flavors
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
just
not
really
digging
this
one
could
use
a
lot
more
sweetness
whether
it
be
oat
chocolate
or
caramel
flavors
not
one
to
seek
out
tried
on
tap
at
the
bottleworks
after
a
tour
this
was
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
great
chocolate
oatmeal
roasted
malts
all
of
the
good
stuff
to
be
expected
in
a
good
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
is
great
very
creamy
and
malty
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
i
could
drink
these
all
days
a
great
buy
for
the
buck
d
not
particularly
sweet
malty
hoppy
or
strong
tasting
this
muted
stout
is
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
very
drinakable
oatmeal
drinks
pretty
good
a
good
starter
oatmeal
stout
overall
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
if
unspectacular
beer
it
was
a
good
quality
smooth
and
well
balanced
brew
i
would
have
no
problem
recommending
this
to
anyone
who
favors
stouts
taste
is
bitter
from
all
of
the
roasted
malt
along
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
malt
is
also
has
a
bit
of
a
toasted
character
giving
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
nutty
characteristic
noticed
in
the
aroma
hops
are
noticeable
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
medium
to
full
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
the
first
stout
i
have
ever
had
besides
guinness
and
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
it
but
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
still
a
decent
beer
from
schlafly
had
this
on
tap
at
the
tap
room
had
a
thick
sandy
brown
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
few
then
left
with
thick
lacing
that
hung
on
the
glass
throughout
the
drink
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
hint
of
ruby
red
around
the
edges
had
a
definate
malty
aroma
with
a
underlying
scent
of
coffee
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
toffee
and
a
definate
oaty
finish
i
liked
this
alot
especially
directly
from
the
source
at
the
tap
room
took
home
a
growler
of
this
to
hold
me
over
for
a
few
days
since
i
am
only
a
15
minutes
from
the
brewery
i
will
definately
be
getting
more
of
this
soon

appears
to
be
very
good
and
there
is
a
moderate

the

brings
roasty
and
nutty
maltyness
a
nice
roundness
almost
creamy
from
the
oatmeal
with
a
kiss
of
coffee
hiding
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
oaty
up
front
moving
to
a
mild
bitter
and
slightly
pineyness
from
the
hop
finishing
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
more
bitter
as
i
swallow
the
beer
i
get
a
bit
of
alcohol
coming
up
into
my
sinus
cavity
which
detracts
a
little
from
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
very
minimal
carbonation
with
a
hint
of
creamy
texture
to
it
overall
this
is
a
fairly
nice
brew
it
is
one
that
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
from
now
on
ill
be
drinking
my
schlaflys

stouts
at
a
much
warmer

a
most
sessionable
stout
not
overly
filling
but
very

its
ok
but
with
better

available
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again

to

from

a

with
about
two
fingers
of
bubbly

smells
of
roasted

coffee
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
tastes
of
lightly
roasted
coffee
and
a
hint
of
bittersweet
cocoa
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
pretty
tasty
example
and
one
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
not
available
locally
and
i
never
make
a
special
trip
for
it
but
i
could
session
this
oatmeal
stout
if
at
the
taproom
i
probably
would
session
this
stout

experienced
it

to

the

theres
also
a
good
amount
of

on

after
drinking
the
beer
it
smells
like
roasted

oatmeal
and
coffee
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
to
me
except
that
it
starts
out
with
maltyoatmeal
sweetness
and
then
has
a
bitter
coffeelike
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
side
but
creamy
the
drinkability
is
good
too
this
is
a
smooth
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
its
certainly
drinkable
and
i
would
buy
it
again
well
brewed
beer
but
a
little
timidcaught
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
a

the
roasted
malts
add
character
and
depth
but
still
allow
the
base
malt
sweetness
to
pronounce
the
color
is
dark
but
not
opaque
and
has
a
light
head
retention
carbonation
and
lacing
the
dark
grains
and
light
hopping
rates
give
a
complex
bittering
but
lightness
with
the
oats
never
rounds
the
beer
out
properly
though
light
and
drinkable
in
the
body
the
smoothness
and
slickness
doesnt
show
thins
a
bit
toward
the

a
nice
drinkable
beer
nevertheless
thanks
again

d
considering

you
could
easily
down
a
sixer
of
these
no

the
taste
flaws
that
may
stunt
that
decent

at

im

there

oddly
enough
my
girlfriend
who
like

has
dark

fear
really
liked
this
one
that
kind
of
suprised
me
overall
but
from
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
of
this
beer
im
not
so
sure
that
i
did
in
drinking
this
im
wondering
where
the
smoothness
is
wheres
the
sweet
and
full
flavor
this
bears
a
lot
more
resemblance
to
a
lager
than
an
oatmeal
stout
its
not
that
the
beer
is
necessarily
bad
not
fantastic

enjoy

just
straight

my
local
grocery

sold
these
individually
and
my
only
regret
is
that
i
bought
one
instead
of
six
while
not
the
most
robust
oatmeal
stout
it
does
fit
the

it
is

liked
the

never

an
oatmeal
stout
before
but
after
trying
this
offering
i
will
seek
out
future
oatmeal
stouts
and
offerings
from
new
glarus
another
reason
to
leave
illinois
and
head
to
wisconsin
overall
excellent
example
of
the
style
like
a
little
brother
to
founders
breakfast
stout
or
wake
n
bake
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
this
oatmeal
stout
i
dont
generally
expect
a
standard
oatmeal
stout
to
be
mind
blowing
as
oatmeal
in
itself
is
rather
bland
but
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
had
a
just
enough
flavor
and
lively
carbonation
to
keep
it
interesting
very
good
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
was
disappointing
i
pours
and
tastes
more
like
a
dark
lager
or
thinner
porter
bubbles
are
large
and
dissipate
quickly
if
i
made
this
beer
myself
i
would
call
it
a
miss
o
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
of
the
imperial
stout
i
tend
to
drink
these
days
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
and
again
when
available
o
i
enjoy
this
oatmeal
stout
a
lot
as
a
typical
weeknight
drinker
plenty
of

makes
for
a
nice
winter
warmer
when
its
cold
and
snowy
out
very
balanced
and
wellput
together
as
typical
of
new
glarus
beer
as
usual
new
glarus
makes
a
solid
beer
not
amazing
but
good
mellow
sort
of
muted
chocolate
flavor
with
all
the
roasted
creaminess
of
an
oatmeal
stout
another
solid
brew
from
new
glarus
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
some
good
carbonation
but
produced
a
tad
more
than
a
wisp
of
a
head
not
super
dark
looks
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
dark
brown
like
a
deep
dark
brown
ale
roasted
coffee
and
a
nice
sweet
note
of
chocolate
flavor
was
very
good
cocoa
like
roasted
malts
and
very
smooth
i
dont
mind
making
my
way
through
this
kind
of
road
slush
indoors
overall
a
very
good
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
good
dark
malt
and
oat
flavors
with
a
nice
creamy
body
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
not
as
heavy
of
a
mouth
feel
as
expected
from
a
stout
but
that
only
adds
to
the
ease
that
they
go
down
i
liked
this
beer
i
had
velvet
merkin
last
week
and
i
prefer
the
road
slush
nice
thin
black
pour
with
a
big
fluffy
head
roasted
mild
coffee
aroma
with
good
hint
of
chocolate
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
sweet
roasted
taste
with
plenty
of
cocoa
flavor
really
good
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
nice
and
complex
with
molasses
toasted
oats
and
hints
of
coffee
this
is
a
smooth
wellbalanced
stout
that
really
delivers
the
after
taste
is
a
little
bitter
with
a
lingering
oat
flavor
pours
dark
brown
to
black
smell
is
toasty
and
a
little
creamy
taste
follows
and
it
is
really
nice
for
me
this
is
a
perfect
session
stout
i
could
drink
45
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
highly
recommend
this
new
glarus
does
it
again
great
beer
i
had
this
beer
as
the
people
i
was
with
wouldnt
try
it
they
are
all
busch
light
drinkers
and
nothing
else
it
was
my
first
oatmeal
stout
and
it
was
good
at
the
time
i
wasnt
big
into
craft
so
i
didnt
pour
into
a
pint
glass
oatmeal
and
nuts
was
the
taste
i
was
addicted
but
havent
had
the
beer
since
also
willing
to
trade
for
some
of
this
beer
o
meh
more
of
a
traditional
stout
that
would
be
session
able
but
by
itself
its
not
all
that
much
of
a
tasting
experience
odecent
oatmeal
stout
a
little
on
the
thin
side
and
not
as
rich
tasting
as
others
d
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
nothing
that
will
blow
your
mind
but
it
wont
let
you
down
either
this
was
out
at
the
brewery
fortunately
my
buddy
had
one
in
his
fridge
for
me
to
try
notes
nice
oatmeal
stout
it
lacks
a
bit
of
the
classical
body
you
expect
and
the
flavor
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
aroma
but
its
a
nice
balanced
oatmeal
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
but
not
amazing
what
appeared
to
be
a
simple
run
of
the
mill
stout
actually
has
some
neat
nuances
running
through
it
i
recommend
you
take
a
little
extra
time
when
drinking
this
one
letting
it
warm
a
little
it
will
continue
to
grow
on
you
another
solid
new
glarus
effort
overall
a
different
take
on
a
stout
and
very
well
crafted
the
appearance
stood
out
with
the
head
and
lacing
i
really
enjoy
all
the
beers
from
new
glarus
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
and
i
usually
think
oatmeal
stouts
are
kind
of
boring
but
new
glarus
once
again
proves
they
can
make
me
like
something
i
didnt
think
i
would
i
like
this
beer
it
gives
me
everything
it
should
plenty
of
dark
roast
and
most
of
the
flavors
that
come
with
it
and
enough
oat
presence
to
satisfy
my
needs
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
its
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
a
quality
stout
i
didnt
get
that
many
oatmeal
flavors
but
this
was
very
good
nonetheless
pours
black
as
night
with
a
fluffy
khaki
colored
head
that
dissipates
pretty
slowly
and
laces
well
throughout
smell
is
of
sweet
oats
toasty
malts
and
some
cacao
the
taste
is
fantastic
fluctuates
gracefully
from
sip
to
sip
toffee
milk
chocolate
espresso
sugary
oat
flakes
milk
and
caramel
toffee
notes
lingering
sip
to
sip
this
was
way
to
smooth
and
delicious
to
sip
on
with
a
bag
of
chocolate
covered
pretzels
a
good
all
around
stout
more
on
the
traditional
side
of
the
spectrum
but
about
what
i
expected
from
a
new
glarus
seasonal
o
this
is
a
solid
stout
with
a
nice
flavor
without
being
over
bearing
its
sort
of
nice
to
have
a
stout
that
isnt
imperial
and
gonna
knock
you
on
your
ass
good
flavor
for
less
buzz
check
it
out
o
a
very
sessionable
stout
that
should
probably
be
stocked
up
on
as
it
is
seasonal
o
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
although
i
could
go
for
a
little
more
dark
malts
and
somewhat
less
carbonation
id
drink
it
again
m
i
like
the
medium
body
creamy
in
texture
with
real
nice
warming
the
bitterness
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
the
taste
was
on
par
for
a
stout
though
almost
more
of
a
fullflavored
brown
ale
than
an
oatmeal
stout
this
dark
brew
is
nutty
chocolatey
and
bitter
great
beer
ngs
routine
beers
are
merely
average
and
their
speciality
beers
are
spectacular
this
falls
into
the
average
category
it
is
an
ok
drink
nothing
more
if
recommended
means
i
encourage
you
to
buy
it
if
its
the
best
thing
on
the
menu
then
yes
i
recommend
it
d
another
solid
new
glarus
offering
great
session
brew
good
drinkability
overall
a
great
sweet
stout
that
had
just
a
slight
mild
bitterness
to
it
excellent
body
here
too
as
the
oats
impart
a
creamy
smooth
texture
while
the
moderate
carbonation
sharpens
the
edges
chocolate
malt
brown
sugarsweetened
oatmeal
little
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
very
welldone
beer
here
after
my
last
ng
experience
i
needed
a
good
reminder
was
to
why
this
is
one
of
my
top5
breweries
this
beer
reminded
me
thanks
andy
o
good
drinkability
abv
is
a
little
on
the
higher
side
for
an
oatmeal
stout
in
my
opinion
well
done
for
sure
its
better
than
a
lot
of
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
but
there
are
some
better
ones
too
another
good
beer
from
new
glarus
though
it
cannot
compete
with
breakfast
stout
overall
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
it
isnt
very
high
on
my
preferred
oatmeal
stouts
list
will
definitely
drink
again
but
not
for
awhile
probably
o
a
really
great
beer
the
roasted
mat
presence
creates
a
really
strong
back
bone
for
this
beer
to
thrive
the
silky
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
taste
and
makes
this
beer
disappear
a
lot
quicker
than
you
would
like
poured
out
into
a
pint
glass
absolutely
opaque
dark
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
fluffy
sand
colored
head
with
light
lacing
and
fair
retention
smells
mostly
like
a
dark
chocolate
mocha
coffee
with
a
side
of
roasted
grain
aroma
in
the
background
tastes
of
all
of
these
things
from
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
light
raisinlike
fruitiness
in
the
finish
very
silky
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
almost
velvety
even
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
indeed
im
having
great
difficulty
nitpicking
any
faults
or
issues
out
of
it
i
just
wanna
put
one
in
the
freezer
in
a
paper
bag
for
half
an
hour
and
see
if
i
can
make
a
slushy
out
of
it
o
very
good
oatmeal
stout
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
oatmeal
stouts
lack
flavor
but
not
this
one
o
i
loved
this
stout
a
very
solid
beer
from
new
glarus
like
i
have
always
come
to
expect
they
put
out
such
solid
brews
that
i
drive
to
hudson
to
get
them
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
stout
that
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
well
balanced
i
will
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
stout
fans
o
overall
i
wish
the
oatmeal
was
a
little
more
prominent
and
added
some
complimentary
sweetness
to
the
roasted
malts
but
i
realize
os
varies
from
dry
to
sweet
otherwise
a
very
wellmade
drinkable
stout
this
is
a
terrific
beer
so
glad
i
picked
it
up
such
flavorful
big
beer
perhaps
not
massive
but
this
is
a
meal
in
a
bottle
a
real
treat
to
run
into
as
it
grows
on
be
with
each
sip
o
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
its
a
shame
you
can
only
grab
this
beer
in
wi
luckily
i
now
live
in
chicago
and
am
only
about
an
hour
away
from
the
border
i
will
def
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
get
the
chance
cost
2
for
a
single
bottle
or
10
99
for
a
six
pack
o
not
bad
not
great
i
will
give
this
stout
points
for
being
incredibly
easy
to
drink
it
wouldnt
offend
anyone
and
would
probably
be
a
great
option
for
someone
new
to
the
style
this
is
a
beer
that
just
delivers
what
youd
hope
a
good
stout
would
call
me
a
homer
if
you
will
but
new
glarus
continues
to
impress
me
with
every
new
offering
from
them
that
i
try
incidentally
this
is
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
while
catching
up
with
friends
in
an
icefishing
shack
o
excellent
offering
by
ng
i
was
expecting
a
bit
sweeter
but
overall
i
though
this
was
a
great
single
stout
definitely
will
stock
up
on
this
one
while
its
around
o
tasty
and
drinkable
with
good
characteristics
a
single
stout
that
holds
up
well
and
opens
up
as
it
warms
o
i
enjoy
most
of
the
beers
from
ng
and
was
not
disappointed
by
this
stout
i
also
wasnt
overly
wowed
by
any
of
the
flavors
a
classic
slightly
above
average
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
very
solid
stout
good
roasted
malt
flavors
along
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
to
keep
things
balanced
nothing
spectacular
but
a
very
good
solid
stout
and
a
very
worthy
session
beer
pours
black
dull
medium
coffee
brown
with
about
two
fingers
of
medium
khaki
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
very
appetizing
like
fresh
roasted
malt
with
dark
chocolate
undertones
taste
is
light
roasted
malt
and
some
melted
chocolate
really
smooth
and
nicely
balanced
lengthy
finish
that
is
slightly
off
dry
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
drinkable
reminds
me
of
a
light
britishstyle
stout
i
would
definitely
put
this
in
the
regular
rotation
o
not
terrible
but
im
glad
this
was
a
single
ill
stick
to
samuel
smiths
for
oatmeal
stouts
do
middle
of
the
pack
oatmeal
stout
nice
if
youd
like
more
than
one
otherwise
skip
this
was
quite
an
interesting
take
on
an
oatmeal
stout
with
this
being
much
more
hop
forward
in
terms
of
the
fruitiness
here
than
what
i
was
expecting
this
wasnt
necessarily
bad
but
just
different
i
will
say
though
that
the
oatmeal
did
keep
this
quite
smooth
on
the
palate
for
the
size
this
is
one
that
i
would
like
to
try
fresh
on
tap
sometime
not
quite
as
creamy
as
i
would
expect
an
oatmeal
stout
to
be
but
it
has
a
good
body
and
nice
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
here
happy
to
have
gotten
my
hands
on
a
bottle
to
try
md
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
heavy
carbonation
almost
like
a
berry
flavored
seltzer
not
very
beer
like
but
then
again
it
is
a
new
glarus
beer
almost
like
a
slushy
beer
without
the
ice
way
more
porter
like
than
stouty
not
great
but
not
a
bad
beer
middle
of
the
road
d
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
ive
truly
been
let
down
by
a
new
glarus
beer
not
interested
in
ticking
this
one
again
poured
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
brown
highlights
that
had
a
thin
bubbly
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
some
really
nice
chocolatey
greeted
me
first
on
the
nose
with
some
roasty
character
slight
lacto
milky
notes
and
faint
brown
sugar
notes
as
well
the
chocolatey
flavors
are
more
apparent
on
the
palate
alongside
lacto
character
but
had
mild
roasty
accents
and
a
touch
of
underlying
hops
it
did
have
a
little
brown
sugar
notes
too
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
milky
chocolatey
and
creamy
finish
i
really
did
like
the
overall
chocolate
character
in
the
beer
and
tought
it
drank
good
glad
i
got
to
tick
this
brew
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
overall
the
roads
up
here
are
slushy
and
snowyso
i
figured
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
dig
out
this
received
from
a
generous
ba
earlier
this
yr
nothing
like
a
classy
oatmeal
stout
to
finish
my
day
dark
chocolate
black
color
with
a
quickly
fading
beige
head
aroma
is
espresso
roasted
malt
and
oats
not
overly
bitter
nice
moderately
sweet
flavor
dominant
with
roasted
malts
and
mild
chocolate
finish
has
strong
dry
flavor
of
oats
and
little
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
balanced
take
on
the
style
d
i
could
have
a
few
but
would
want
something
stronger
at
some
point
what
can
i
say
about
this
a
wonderful
stout
and
yet
another
great
offering
from
new
glarus
pretty
good
stout
as
far
as
i
can
tell
new
glarus
doesnt
make
bad
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
not
what
i
would
think
of
when
i
think
of
an
oatmeal
stout
the
lighter
body
and
flavor
lends
to
easier
drinking
though
i
am
not
sure
that
is
necessarily
a
good
thing
d
for
a
6
2
this
is
not
super
drinkable
but
its
not
hard
to
drink
either
i
put
it
as
merely
average
a
medium
brown
in
color
slight
murkiness
to
the
beer
head
is
thick
and
lightly
tanned
and
shows
good
retention

thin
not
the
best
ive
had
from
new
glarus
d
goes
down
easily
nicely
balanced
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
sit
with
for
the
duration
dpretty
easy
drinking
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
great
beer
i
was
impressed
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
great
flavor
delish
stout
that
i
could
drink
all
night
since
it
didnt
seem
so
heavy
dnot
ngs
best
work
but
very
solid
they
rarely
strike
out
but
this
is
at
least
a
solid
base
hit
i
am
happy
with
this
one
but
not
thrilled
a
wonderfully
sessionable
stout
d
i
wasnt
expecting
this
good
of
a
beer
to
be
honest
i
dont
know
why
though
carey
and
co
hit
home
runs
like
barry
bonds
would
on
a
gallon
of
the
clear
the
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
bitter
and
creamy
with
a
solid
stout
taste
a
little
hoppier
than
some
stouts
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
solid
taste
i
will
give
this
bonus
points
on
drinkability
because
its
user
friendly
and
not
filling
for
the
style
but
overall
i
found
it
a
rather
average
stout
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
black
with
a
reddish
hue
with
a
fizzy
light
brown
head
aroma
is
coffee
roasted
malt
oats
and
a
hint
of
spiciness
flavor
is
sweet
and
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
sweet
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
little
watery
dry
and
bitter
finish
solid
beer
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
dissapointing
experience
with
new
glarus
i
just
dont
get
it
with
this
beer
it
pours
a
nice
enough
looking
colaesque
brown
the
nose
is
grain
and
subtle
hints
of
sweet
malt
but
not
incredibly
noticeable
the
taste
is
lacking
for
me
and
not
all
that
stouty
i
do
get
a
roasty
oatsy
flavor
with
an
acidic
finish
that
just
seems
to
thin
to
be
a
stout
anyway
it
seems
more
aleish
than
anything
pours
a
light
black
color
with
1
finger
head
that
dissipates
to
a
beigecherry
ring
smell
is
roasted
oats
and
malts
with
some
toffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
its
smooth
oats
and
malts
followed
by
a
semisweet
chocolate
its
very
smooth
it
drinks
like
a
scotch
ale
or
brown
combo
the
mouth
feel
is
velvety
smooth
and
sweet
on
the
palate
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
smooth
and
flavorful
ng
makes
one
fine
brew
after
another
new
glarus
super
solid
beer
quality
all
around
would
definitely
drink
this
again
hell
of
a
beer
overall
these
guys
continue
to
impress
i
drank
this
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
orval
glass
the
beer
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
not
totally
appealing
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
a
head
that
rises
a
good
full
three
fingers
of
light
tan
head
decent
renention
nice
lacing
as
it
falls
very
thick
and
covers
totally
the
aroma
is
little
off
almost
a
generic
quality
to
it
light
coffee
bourbon
really
light
smoke
but
just
overall
weird
the
taste
is
much
better
its
actually
pretty
appetizing
light
coffee
and
chocolate
easy
to
drink
to
start
but
a
weird
flat
finish
in
general
its
also
pretty
light
d
this
beer
is
ok
smell
and
taste
leave
something
to
be
desired
overall
a
decent
stout
but
not
one
id
actively
seek
out
again
overall
this
is
a
good
mild
oatmeal
stout
its
nothing
too
fancy
or
out
there
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
dont
understand
the
oatmeal
stout
thing
its
way
more
like
a
brown
alestout
combo
that
leans
more
towards
the
brown
ale
category
either
way
tasty
as
hell
flavor
is
ok
coffee
notes
slightly
malty
and
thats
about
it
not
a
very
exciting
beer
almost
tastes
watered
down
with
the
high
carbonation
not
boozy
at
all
light
mouthfeel
more
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
then
the
actual
beer
taste
of
course
as
it
warms
it
gets
slightly
better
but
not
much
overall
a
pretty
average
stout
once
again
dan
carey
proves
to
me
the
man
knows
his
stuff
some
aspects
of
this
beer
i
may
not
completely
buy
into
but
there
is
no
doubt
it
is
superbly
executed
in
its
creation
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
very
well
retained
promising
start
smell
is
a
little
bit
sweet
with
roasted
malts
and
other
grains
the
taste
is
also
fairly
sweet
as
well
as
some
bitterness
mouth
feel
is
a
little
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
smooth
drinkability
is
decent
not
my
favorite
offering
from
ng
overall
this
is
the
first
stout
ive
ever
tried
from
new
glarus
and
im
enjoying
it
i
like
the
smooth
roasted
flavors
and
lack
of
bitterness
the
gritty
feeling
left
in
the
mouth
is
a
negative
though
part
of
my
secret
bunny
2010
haul
from
roborb
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
translucent
ruby
brown
color
with
a
good
inch
of
creamy
light
tan
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
medium
roasted
grains
bitter
chocolate
earthy
grassy
hops
coffee
and
mocha
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
in
the
aroma
as
it
warms
up
the
stout
is
at
least
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
adequate
carbonation
and
a
bitter
roasty
finish
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
an
oatmeal
stout
this
one
has
been
on
my
wants
for
a
few
years
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
thanks
again
rob
d
the
flavor
is
mellow
and
aroma
is
a
bit
lacking
in
character
but
what
this
beer
really
excels
at
is
the
mouthfeel
close
to
perfect
road
slush
goes
down
nicely
and
is
pretty
drinkable
for
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
seems
off
as
far
as
style
is
concerned
this
seems
like
a
big
nut
brown
ale
instead
of
a
stout
really
thin
glad
i
got
to
try
this
drinkability
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
nice
flavor
and
a
nice
creamy
body
to
it
which
made
it
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
overall
full
bodied
with
a
soft
finish
malty
rich
smooth
with
cocoa
in
front
of
the
flavors
remains
sweet
throughout
but
very
wellbalanced
and
pretty
much
wavering
on
delicious
really
terrific
oatmeal
stout
good
sessioner
too
nothing
revolutionary
but
nicely
balanced
and
makes
for
an
easy
drinker
d
when
i
think
of
stouts
a
session
beer
never
comes
to
mind
however
this
may
be
the
closest
thing
to
a
session
stout
for
me
ng
has
many
other
beers
that
i
would
search
out
just
to
have
but
road
slush
is
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
a
nice
simple
stout
i
wish
i
could
get
this
easier
overall
this
was
a
decent
offering
from
ng
but
nothing
too
special
it
just
didnt
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
from
an
oatmeal
stout
it
was
decent
and
drinkable
just
nothing
special
i
dig
it
for
what
it
is
good
drinkability
seems
more
of
an
american
stout
a
nice
beer
but
i
would
go
for
something
else
next
time
husky
grains
something
i
can
associate
with
oatmeal
mellow
flavor
is
similarly
low
key
some
mild
sweetness
and
barely
there
roasty
elements
silky
smooth
easy
to
session
thats
pretty
much
what
this
is
all
about
a
mild
stout
with
prime
sessionability
mellow
carbonation
thinnish
body
like
an
english
cask
stout
solid
flavor
just
a
little
too
simple
to
hold
extended
interest
fairly
drinkable
but
bland
enough
to
be
fairly
forgettable
overall
a
decent
easy
drinker
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
not
thick
and
chewy
like
most
oatmeal
stouts
that
said
the
flavors
were
quite
good
if
not
a
little
bit
too
roast
forward
there
is
so
much
burnt
grain
character
its
hard
to
pick
out
other
small
nuances
and
flavors
d
goes
down
easy
but
every
time
i
take
a
sip
i
think
that
there
should
be
more
to
it
the
flavor
is
really
good
but
there
just
seems
to
be
something
missing
glad
they
brought
this
beer
back
though
i
dont
know
for
sure
if
road
slush
is
in
fact
retired
if
it
is
thats
a
shame
its
extremely
impressive
for
what
it
is
i
wish
the
nose
were
a
little
stronger
but
thats
the
only
criticism
i
have
its
really
wellrounded
otherwise
if
you
happen
to
see
this
one
on
a
shelf
somewhere
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
it
up
its
another
solid
beer
from
new
glarus
blessed
be
the
brew
cheers
dan
very
hearty
and
definitely
a
drinkable
stout
its
good
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
sessionworthy
pint
if
there
ever
was
one
good
example
of
the
style
a
balanced
blend
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
would
be
great
to
have
another
taste
of
this
relative
rarity
definitely
tasty
beer
but
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
though
its
certainly
somewhere
in
the
upper
range
for
some
reason
i
just
love
the
name
of
this
beer
if
you
can
get
it
i
would
recommend
it
probably
one
of
the
top
3
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
ever
had
d
just
wonderful
cant
sop
with
it
if
it
was
easier
to
get
it
would
be
a
new
fixture
in
my
fridge
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
roast
forward
stout
i
like
that
it
remains
balanced
in
check
and
the
roast
character
does
not
get
overly
astringent
or
acidic
i
would
be
quite
happy
reaching
for
this
when
i
wanted
a
session

an

the
head
is

the

the

is

this
is
a
fantastic

i
could
easily
drink

again
and
again
drinkable
oh
heck
yes
although
even
a

like

im

its

want

all

nice

flavor
comment
i
really
like
this
stout
a
great
edc
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
tried
much
earlier
the
drinkability
is
its
strong
point
d
yes
it
is
a
good
session
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
black
with
a
medium
sized
tannish
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
chocolate
cherries
and
a
bit
doughy
the
flavor
is
initially
sweet
chocolate
but
then
floral
hops
and
oats
shine
through
finishes
abruptly
and
sweet
really
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
very
nice
drinkable
stout
but
i
felt
it
didnt
really
have
the
complexity
it
deserved
overall
though
i
would
drink
this
again
drinkability
a
fine
session
stout
much
thanks
to
brdc
for
this
diamond
in
the
rough
acquired
at
dld08
road
slush
is
another
winner
from
new
glarus
road
slush
is
a
lighter
bodied
stout
that
falls
right
in
the
lines
of
a
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
the
mild
sweetness
adds
that
little
extra
oomph
i
would
pick
this
beer
up
again
without
a
doubt
your
time
well
worth
waiting
for
bottle
courtesy
of
oakbluff
poured
a
clear
black
color
stout
with
a
big
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aromas
of
dry
roasted
notes
are
dominating
taste
is
also
dominated
by
quite
dry
roasted
malt
with
very
little
else
to
report
body
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
simple
without
much
complexity
but
still
well
done
for
the
style
i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
taste
better
beer
form
this
brewer
pours
a
dark
molasses
with
some
ruby
highlights
a
foamy
two
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
slowly
dies
down
to
creamy
layer
of
goodness
thick
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
like
where
this
is
going
smokey
malts
toasted
oat
and
kettle
korn
popcorn
up
front
on
the
nose
some
charred
wood
earthy
hops
and
leather
in
the
aroma
as
well
a
lot
going
on
in
terms
of
smell
i
love
it
sweet
coffee
flavor
at
first
followed
by
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
brown
sugar
wood
and
creamy
oatmeal
midway
with
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
with
hints
of
licorice
light
to
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
a
rough
feel
to
it
carbonation
is
on
the
strong
side
for
the
style
but
i
dont
seem
to
mind
road
slush
went
down
pretty
quick
but
thats
what
happens
when
a
beer
is
this
tasty
i
love

still
another
good
beer
from
new

there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
boy
kind
of
like
a
sa
boston
lager
on
steroids
darker
mahogony
colored
great
beer
i
enjoyed
every
sip
trying
to
identify
all
of
the
great
flavors
this
one
is
a
winner
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
mahogany
hints
around
the
edges
the
head
is
thin
and
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
small
swirl
around
the
top
with
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
big
on
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
really
nice
aroma
on
this
one
the
taste
is
bigger
on
the
sweet
chocolate
malts
followed
up
by
a
more
subtle
coffee
and
oatmeal
taste
that
gives
way
to
fairly
dry
slightly
hopped
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
for
an
oatmeal
stout
with
decent
carbonation
this
a
decent
stout
from
new
glarus
and
extremely
drinkable
well
crafted
bu
not
memorable
new
glarus
makes
some
mighty
fine
beers
while
this
would
be
good
for
some
maybe
even
a
flagship
beer
for
other
breweries
it
fails
to
meet
the
new
glarus
standards
in
my
view
its
worth
trying
but
dont
make
this
your
first
impression
of
new
glarus
edit
ok
so
i
checked
their
website
and
they
list
this
brew
at
6
2abv
good
job
bill
lol
drinkability
is
good
fairly
well
balanced
just
a
little
plain
and
thin
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddish

settles
down
to
a

some

not
much
going

aroma
is
nice
but
the
flavour
is
weak
thanks
scott
d
decent
but
not
overly
enticing
very
tasty
drinkable
brew
not
too
sweet
or
richly
overwhelming
d
very
drinkable
stout
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
good
but
a
little
short
for
the
style
a
good
oatmeal
stout
should
be
chewy
this
one
is
thick
but
the
chewy
part
isnt
there
for
me
but
it
is
a
nice
stout
feel
and
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
beer
good
stuff
just
not
my
favorite
in
style
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
an
all
around
excellent
oatmeal
stout
enjoy
pours
a
mixture
of
dark
brown
with
deep
garnet
highlights
not
much
of
a
head
after
the
pour
and
only
a
half
and
half
ring
of
foam
after
a
few
sips
no
visible
bubbling
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
well
put
medium
coffee
with
some
grainy
biscuits
faintly
lingering
around
the
first
sip
is
a
lightly
nutty
straight
black
coffee
the
middle
is
a
little
fruity
flavor
mixed
with
a
more
watered
down
coffee
flavors
that
leads
to
a
quick
dry
finish
the
palate
went
by
a
litl
to
fast
the
greatnutty
coffee
flavor
was
there
at
the
beginning
of
each
sip
but
it
went
away
too
quickly
pours
dark
black
with
a
reddish
tan
and
tight
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
is
a
medium
size
roastiness
with
some
malt
ball
and
chocolate
sweetness
also
hints
of
smokiness
and
milk
sugary
sweetness
taste
follows
these
lines
with
a
nice
balance
chocolate
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
an
acidic
like
milky
roastiness
and
finishing
with
cola
and
chocolate
medium
to
heavy
body
and
incredibly
silky
smooth
carbonation
is
velvety
with
just
a
little
tingle
on
the
tongue
highly
drinkable
outstanding
representation
of
the
style
a
good
selection
from
new
glarus
i
wish
stevens
points
pubs
and
dining
establishments
would
offer
ore
than
just
spotted
cow
from
the
new
glarus
brewery
this
is
certainly
a
beer
id
love
to
sample
on
draft
i
actually
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
a
good
effort
of
the
style
highly
drinkable
this
is
the
best
offering
ive
had
yet
out
of
new
glarus
complex
flavors
at
work
none
of
them
overpowering
very
well
balanced
i
could
probably
go
through
a
six
on
my
own
and
not
get
bored
flavors
could
be
a
tiny
smidge
bolder
but
that
would
probably
result
in
diminished
quaffing
d
given
the
slightly
average
marks
this
is
surprisingly
easy
on
the
palate
easy
to
drink
but
i
can
think
of
a
few
dozen
other
oatmeal
stouts
id
rather
drink
smooth
tasting
slight
after
taste
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
decent
this
brew
drinks
more
like
a
nut
brown
ale
than
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
but
the
flavors
present
create
a
nicely
proportioned
profile
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
are
much
better
oatmeals
out
there
i
bought
this
as
a
single
bottle
at
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
decent
but
nothing
special
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
completely
nontransparent
with
a
mouth
watering
12
in
thick
cream
head
that
lasted
very
well
leaving
thick
patches
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
heavily
clouded
by
yeast
but
there
was
a
warm
chocolate
and
noticeable
roasted
almond
backdrop
the
taste
was
as
warm
as
the
smell
great
flavors
of
thick
oatmeal
and
chocolate
with
some
yeast
residue
in
the
after
taste
this
has
a
great
thick
body
with
moderate
to
light
carbonation
with
spring
in
the
air
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
outside
in
the
cool
temps
and
enjoy
taste
mouthfeel
semidry
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
almost
burnt
toast
with
a
coffeelike
finish
very
simple
and
straightforward
nice
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
ive
hunted
it
for
a
long
time
and
havent
been
able
to
find
it
in
western
wisconsin
doverall
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
other
new
g
beers
i
would
rather
have
pairing
note
tried
to
pair
with
baked
chocolatepear
pudding
first
sip
after
each
bite
was
excellent
but
chocolate
was
a
bit
overpowering
for
the
stout
and
sweetness
of
dessert
overly
dominated
the
light
sugars
in
the
stout
on
subsequent
sips
it
works
well
but
its
not
a
perfect
match
body
also
doesnt
hold
up
to
thick
chocolate
texture
and
hops
come
out
stronger
and
clash
beautiful
dark
stout
with
a
huge
brown
head
this
thing
poured
almost
like
a
guinness
detected
a
little
hop
aroma
but
not
much
more
hops
came
through
strong
in
the
mouth
as
well
with
a
little
maltiness
in
the
middle
and
a
strong
hop
finish
felt
a
little
alcohol
warming
as
it
went
down
and
also
thought
i
might
have
tasted
a
little
dark
coffee
good
mouthfeel
with
medlight
carbonation
perfect
for
the
style
still
not
quite
as
smooth
as
id
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
though
a
little
harshness
that
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
overall
this
is
a
very
good
very
strong
stout
stout
stout
stout
let
it
all
out
d
solid
oatmeal
stout
a
great
session
beer
when
your
in
the
mood
for
some
dark
beers
damn
fine
brew
poured
with
a
nice
fine
foamy
head
and
plenty
of
lace
rich
stout
aroma
dark
garnet
color
almost
opaque
not
overly
sweet
very
well
balanced
actually
good
play
between
sweet
and
bitterdry
velvety
texture
quite
drinkable
even
to
say
perhaps
a
session
beer
yum
cheers
this
is
what
oatmeal
stouts
are
all
about
md
smooth
and
full
bodied
and
as
the
bottle
suggests
it
slides
down
a
great
brew
new
glarus
continuously
makes
me
consider
relocation
seriously
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
one
id
go
back
to
again
if
i
had
access
to
them
recommended
this
pours
pretty
damn
black
with
some
ruby
light
at
the
edges
the
head
is
dark
mocha
and
goes
away
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
mostly
roasted
malt
it
is
surprisingly
sweet
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
not
outside
style
it
isnt
a
sweetness
im
used
to
in
a
beer
though
almost
more
artificial
tasting
the
roasted
flavor
does
come
through
however
and
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
also
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
although
a
bit
thinner
on
the
backside
than
i
would
like
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
could
get
it
rich
caramelish
and
even
slightly
minty
due
to
the
hops
was
my
first
impression
of
new
glarus
road
slush
stout
the
black
body
was
almost
completely
opaque
when
held
to
the
light
except
for
a
thin
ring
of
gleeming
mahogany
just
beneath
the
creamy
dark
tan
head
the
retention
was
surprisingly
limited
given
the
style
and
it
dropped
quickly
to
just
a
wide
creamy
collar
the
nose
offered
dark
malts
with
caramel
and
a
charred
roastiness
but
little
chocolate
in
the
mouth
it
flowed
smoothly
and
somewhat
creamily
with
a
dextrinous
medium
body
and
moderate
finebubbled
carbonation
the
flavor
was
supple
and
superbly
rounded
wrapping
lightly
sweet
caramel
in
a
thin
coating
of
almost
burnt
roastiness
coffee
character
appeared
followed
by
hint
of
nuttiness
and
then
some
minty
and
grassy
hops
more
charred
roastiness
came
through
in
the
lingering
finish
quite
nice
very
mellow
despite
the
richness
with
no
dark
malt
acidity
its
lowkey
bitterness
balances
it
and
allows
the
full
character
of
the
caramel
malts
to
come
through
where
otherwise
they
might
be
blunted
a
very
enjoyable
straightforward
and
drinkable
stout
kudos
strangely
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
distracts
me
enough
that
id
only
have
a
few
at
most
the
pour
is
a
very
nice
dark
rich
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
fades
into
a
nice
thick
lace
aroma
is
a
rich
and
hearty
grain
that
is
not
overpowering
flavors
are
a
very
nice
blend
of
oatmeal
and
cocoa
with
a
deep
but
smooth
roasted
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
with
a
smooth
relaxing
feel
which
lend
to
the
excellent
drinkability
this
is
a
great
brew
definitely
give
it
a
try
if
youre
a
stout
fan
or
if
you
are
new
to
this
style
and
want
to
experience
what
a
good
quality
stout
should
taste
like
got
this
in
a
trade
with
ughsmash
poured
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
didnt
last
long
aroma
coco
bitter
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
dark
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
with
hints
of
coffee
flavor
the
dark
sweet
cherries
comes
out
first
followed
by
the
roasted
malts
than
plums
a
nice
sweetness
comes
out
on
every
sip
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
got
more
robust
good
easy
drinking
beer
poured
into

a

over
the
opaque

head
fades
slowly
with
heavy
coating
lacing
aroma
is
rich
and
hearty
dark
grains
oatmeal
apparent
flavor
is
just
right
for
an
oatmeal
stout
no
domination
of
chocolate
or
coffee
just
a
nice
balance
that
allows
the
oatmeal
character
to
shine
through
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
nice
stuff
there
is
an
intensity
to
the
flavor
that
i
like
but
this
seems
to
lack
the
smoothness
which
is
so
appealing
in
this
style
black
in

a
fizzy

with
a
fizzy
aftertaste
that
put
me
off

up

with
some
roasted

showing
up
dark
chocolate
and
a
roasted

finish
thin
mouthfeel
uberfizzy
not
nearly
as
thick
as
desired
decently
drinkable
but
ive
had
far
better
examples
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
with
a
tight
fast
moving
carbonation
that
rushes
across
the
mouth
with
each
sip
not
overly
heavy
this
oatmeal
stout
goes
down
with
ease
and
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
one
sitting
overall
a
tasty
stout
from
new
glarus
thats
worth
giving
a
try
a
decent
stout
flavor
is
hearty
without
becoming
overpowering
worth
a
try
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
would
definitly
drink
again
overall
impression
this
ones
a
winner
in
my
book
id
have
this
in
my
regular
rotation
if
available
im
a
fan
of
the
strong
roasted
character
and
just
enough
sweetness
to
not
cave
in
your
palate
strongly
recommended
almost
black
with
a
tan
fringe
it
sticks
appetizingly
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
all
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
true
to
smell
and
appearance
there
is
nothing
light
or
fruity
about
this
beer
its
stout
and
darn
tasty
theres
a
pleasant
appropriatetostyle
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
in
the
summer
but
it
would
work
on
a
brisk
winter
evening
or
while
ice
fishing
this
is
the
perfect
icefishing
beer
itll
warm
you
up
modest
in
the
mouth
and
leaning
decidedly
thin
it
come
across
a
bit
pedestrian
with
little
to
no
indication
of
the
oatmeal
but
all
told
its
a
decent
sessioner
stout
thank
you
thomashardy
for
this
nice
surprise
i
owe
you
one
drinkability
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
with
some
good
flavor
provided
you
like
a
burnt
malt
flavor
thanks
again
for
all
the
great
beers
john
yum
i
like
this
oaty
stout
a
solid
drinker
and
a
keeper
from
ng
murky
but
not
totally
blocking
out
all
light

like

is
strangely
inviting

sticky
and
sweet
baking
chocolate
flavor
with
nice
roasted
oats
good
balance
of
roastedburnt
flavors
with
relatively
thick
mouthfeel
quite
a
good
beer
wish
id
had
it
in
the
winter
for
full
enjoyment
pours
dark

a
reddish

falling

down

really
nice
aroma
of
roasted

chocolate
coffee
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
a
little
more
coffee
and
a
milky
something
in
there
mouth
is
decent
enough
and
while
not
the
best
stout
out
there
at
all
do
i
like
this
beer
the
taste
is
at
first
a
sweetly
flavored
coffee
with
caramel
there
are
some
mild
malts
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
not
real
chewy
like
some
stouts
but
much
lighter
as
this
stout
warms
the
flavors
really
come
out
the
maltiness
and
coffee
flavors
are
much
more
abundant
as
well
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
uf
so
there
we
go
even
though
i
didnt
know
this
was
an
oatmeal
stout
before
i
drank
it
the
execution
of
the
style
was
good
enough
that
there
was
no
doubt
this
is
a
nice
tasty
stout
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
beer
especially
for
6
a
6
pack
very
drinkable
looks
good

the

this

i
like
the
sweet
smooth
milk
chocolate
smell
balanced
with
a
nice
shot
of
coffee
a
little
underpowered
but
nice
chocolate
flavor
the
oatmeal
does
balance
but
i
like
my
oatmeal
stouts

is
a

this
is
not

taking
a
backseat
also
i
detect
a
light
smoky
aroma
mostly
a
roasted

upfront
combined
with
chocolate
and
coffee
leaves
a
nice
chocolate

this
is
more
like
a
porter
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
considering
this
beer
does
not
fill
you
up
able
to
drink
a
few
in
one
sitting
so
far
my
favorite
offering
from
new
glarus
a
must
try
i
picked
this
beer
up
while
traveling
through
wisconsin
i
bought
it
at
a
gas
station
i
cant
believe
how
good
it
is
for
something
i
grabbed
on
a
lark
my
next
trip
to
wisconsin
i
think
im
going
to
bring
a
couple
six
packs
home
i
want
some
more
please
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
coffee
and
chocolate
nothing
much
more
the
flavor
seems
to
have
a
milksweetness
to
it
along
with
the
chocolate
and
coffee
quite
tasty
but
it
could
probably
also
pass
for
a
milk
stout
the
body
is
moderate
could
use
a
bit
more
and
the
drinkability
is
good
mouth
is
just
thick
enough
and
the
beer
is
a
bit
over
carbonated
a
nice
session
beer
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
exceptional
extra
points
because
of
the
cool
name
and
the
fact
that
it
comes
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries

the

but
somewhat
more
tame
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
not
like
a

of
the
stouts
out
there
overall
this
was
a
very
pleasing
beer

really
wish
i
had
more

with
the
suggestion
of

station
coffee
tastes
more
like
roasty
brown
ale
with
a
milk
chocolate
flavor
than
a
stout
the
coffee
flavor
isnt
too
bad
but
its
a
little
fizzy
the
finish
to
me
is
more

very
very
deep
brown
to

color
with

head
that
falls
slowly
to
a
full

solid
coat

rich

roasted

bite
with
a
very
modest
chocolate
and
light
caramel
sweetness
with
a
solid
creamyness
from
the
oats
brings
it
all
together
i
like
it
flavor
is
much
more
focused
on
the
oat
creamyness
and
chocolate
sweetness
its
initally
slightly
fruity
chocolatey
caramel
and
creamy
moving
towards
a
moderate
roast
finishing
with
a
light
bitterness
from
the
hopping
the
fruityness
is
hard
to
describe
its
not
raisin
or
fig
just
a
generic
fruityness
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
but
with
a
very
creamy
smoothness
to
it
nicely
done
overall
this
one
is
a
fairly
nice
oatmeal
stout
the
nose
is
what
wins
me
over
in
this
one
the
flavor
is
a
close
second
but
id
drink
this
one
again
easily
i
would
go
for
another
sixer
of
this
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
lacked
a
fullness
of
flavor
but
have
come
to
realize
that
there
is
a
nice
wellbalanced
representation
of
flavors
from
sweet
to
bitter
here
very
dark
with
mahogany
highlights
there
was
a
little
bit
of
cascading
after
the
pour
resulting
in
a
dense
cap
of
light
brown
head
good
retention
and
clumpy
lacing
dry
roast
and
nutty
aroma
with
a
light
sourness
plenty
of
roasted
flavour
balanced
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
mild
bitterness
seemed
to
come
partly
from
hops
partly
from
dark
grains
smooth
creamy
body
with
low
carbonation
and
mediumfull
body
a
solid
stout
thanks
hogtownharry
this
has
the
nice
rocky
body
of
a
rough
oatmeal
i
like
it
especially
with
a
lot
of
brewers
trying
to
make
stouts
as
nitrous
smooth
as
possible
i
am
a
little
puzzled
by
this
beer
so
i
will
try
it
again
and
see
if
i
get
used
to
the
flavor
black

light
coffee

fairly
creamy
medium

has
a

chocolate
feel
to
it
some
roasted
notes
and
a
little
char
decent
enough
i
really
dont
think
you
could
expect
more
from
appearance
of
this
its
black
as
can
be
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
an
excellant
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
is
mostly
chocolate
with
only
a
hint
of
a
coffee
smell
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
roasted
smell
to
it
but
i
just
cant
give
it
less
than
a
four
more
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
in
the
taste
as
i
would
expect
the
taste
is
good
but
i
think
it
could
stand
to
have
more
power
to
it
slick
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
im
liking
the
amount
of
carbonation
on
this
i
really
wanted
this
to
be
thicker
than
it
is
pretty
good
stout
no
problem
taking
a
few
down
overall
i
think
if
a
couple
areas
were
slightly
improved
this
could
be
an
unbelievably
good
stout
d
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
nice
flavor
and
aroma
but
would
be
much
better
if
they
were
given
a
boost
black
as
my
cat
this
oatmeal
stout
shows
no
signs
of
visible
light
through
my
pint
glass
as
this
beer
warmed
and
breathed
the
coffee
and
mild
hickory
smoke
gave
way
to
fresh
scents
of
roasted
oats
dark
and
dry
without
being
thick
or
sweet
this
is
a
stout
that
i
will
share
with
friends
fairly
dark
black
color
faint
touch
of
foam
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
robust
smoked
coffee
flavor
the
taste
is
dry
bitter
and
toasty
all
the
way
through
not
very
sweet
at
all
with
a
slight
sourness
in
the
finish
although
the
alcohol
is
not
that
noticible
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thick
as
some
oatmeal
stouts
but
it
was
foamy
with
good
carbonation
semismooth
this
oatmeal
stout
was
unlike
most
other
version
ive
had
it
is
much
less
sweet
and
didnt
have
the
intense
smoothness
created
from
the
oats
if
you
dont
like
a
very
sweet
malt
but
just
a
nice
dark
bitter
stout
you
will
like
this
i
had
never
had
a
stout
from
new
glarus
and
was
hoping
this
was
going
to
be
really
great
i
find
that
its
good
but
undistinguished
you
cant
really
go
wrong
buying
a
six
pack
but
i
think
there
are
other
better
stouts
if
i
found
it
on
tap
id
get
it
again
to
try
it
but
its
not
my
favorite
anyone
have
any
guesses
about
the
abv
pours
a
very
dark
brownnear
black
in
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
consists
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
as
the
beer
warms
the
smell
of
oats
can
picked
up
in
the
nose
also
medium
to
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
coarse
cabonation
not
smooth
rather
somewhat
hearty
yet
fitting
for
this
time
of
year
bitter
chocolate
front
gives
way
to
a
roasted
maltiness
the
oatmeal
adds
an
overall
smoothness
to
the
body
flavors
of
french
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
round
things
out
the
dark
malts
almost
remind
me
of
a
coffee
stout
still
this
a
is
a
great
late
winter
stout
from
new
glarus
overall
im
really
pleased
with
this
offering
from
ng
this
is
the
best
stout
theyve
done
so
far
and
its
really
close
to
being
great
rumor
has
it
that
this
beer
is
currently
blended
with
their
belgian
red
and
will
be
released
as
an
unplugged
series
there
is
ample
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
also
an
odd
waxy
mustiness
that
reminds
me
of
old
ritz
crackers
body
is
a
shiny
black
i
know
how
that
sounds
with
a
thumb
thick
slowly
receding
mocha
head
fore
is
creamy
with
hints
of
vanilla
cocoa
cookie
dough
sweet
cream
and
very
mild
coffee
notes
the
oatmeal
definitely
creates
a
smooth
creamy
feel
from
fore
to
finish
but
i
feel
like
this
lacks
just
a
bit
of
intensity
and
that
keeps
it
from
being
exceptional
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
think
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
ng
im
very
impressed
by
ngs
ability
to
make
solid
beers
of
such
different
styles
would
recommend
and
would
drink
again
smell
is
light
compared
to
the
taste
taste
is
rich
with
smooth
chocolate
malt
crafted
with
precision
feels
great
on
the
mouth
and
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
b
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
would
rather
have
grays
12
ounce
bottle
new
glarus
road
slush
stout
pours
out
black
with
a
tan
head
the
roasted
malt
aroma
is
slightly
woody
malty
flavor
but
quite
dry
chocolate
licorice
and
a
bit
of
smoke
not
as
roasty
as
i
expected
but
no
matter
the
chocolatey
flavor
works
well
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
drinkability
is
great
this
beer
lacks
the
astringency
found
in
many
oatmeal
stouts
possibly
my
favorite
of
new
glaruss
regular
lineup
very
tasty
and
i
must
say
with
only
a
couple
other
stouts
ever
coming
out
of
ng
this
is
definately
the
best
thus
far
drinkability
pretty
high
pours
petroleum
black
with
two
fingers
of
rocky
coffee
foam
beautiful
nose
is
rich
with
shaved
dark
cocoa
mocha
espresso
and
grain
husk
taste
is
a
sublte
muted
version
of
the
nose
chococoffee
a
bit
of
alcoholic
bite
not
sure
on
the
abv
and
toasty
malt
mouthfeel
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
helps
the
drinkability
glad
to
finally
see
new
glarus
offer
a
stout
again
as
they
retired
the
coffee
stout
before
i
got
into
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
for
all
you
stout
lovers
out
there
solid
dark
brown
color
with
faint
ruby
at
the
edges
and
a
smallish
khaki
head
the
slowly
dissipates
chocolate
and
caramel
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
roast
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
nice
beer
could
maybe
use
a
hint
more
roastiness
though
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
exceptionally
good
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
condor
recommended
and
approved
for
the
price
it
is
hard
to
beat
especially
from
such
a
small
brewery
give
this
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
pours
black
in
color
and
you
cant
see
through
it
a
small
beige
head
is
seen
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
and
sides
ringed
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
slides
back
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
taste
has
lots
of
roasted
malt
flavor
with
some
spice
and
coffee
a
very
slight
bitter
finish
that
doesnt
last
long
perfect
carbonation
for
this
type
of
brew
overall
a
very
tasty
stout
light
black
in
color
and
just
a
touch
of
light
will
get
through
a
solid
half
inch
of
light
beige
colored
foam
rests
on
top
brussels
lacing
i
smell
judiciously
used
oats
and
dark
malt
the
first
sip
reveals
a
quick
rush
of
oats
that
is
quickly
overpowered
by
dark
roasted
malt
which
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
slightly
chalky
straightforward
and
simple
o
a
bit
dissapointing
not
as
strong
flavor
and
mouthfeel
as
id
like
from
an
outmeat
stout
would
drink
another
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
overall
there
are
really
some
nice
flavors
here
however
the
lightness
of
the
body
keeps
this
beer
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
appearance
pours
a
deep
molasses
color
hardly
any
head
and
no
lacing
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
smell
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
aroma
like
a
milk
stout
taste
bittersweet
chocolate
mild
expresso
lightly
toasted
bread
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
bodied
for
a
stout
again
very
similar
to
a
milk
stout
or
a
porter
overall
very
enjoyable
and
well
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
a
porter
lover
a
good
pleasant
stout
and
would
prefer
to
try
it
on
tap
overall
a
damn
fine
stout
looks
feels
smells
and
tastes
great
what
more
could
you
want
granted
its
not
a
special
one
off
or
anything
like
that
but
as
far
as
brewery
staple
beers
go
this
is
fantastic
o
as
someone
that
is
not
well
versed
with
stouts
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
o
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
oatmeal
and
light
on
the
roasted
malt
detracts
but
not
horribly
so
overall
decent
enough
but
not
my
favorite
stout
another
beer
picked
up
in
hays
ks
12oz
brown
bottle
the
notch
for
freshness
appears
to
be
april
2012
though
its
extremely
faint
and
i
am
not
sure
this
isnt
just
a
scrape
in
any
event
to
the
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
blackish
color
with
deep
brown
edges
in
the
light
small
1
finger
tannishlight
brown
head
some
retention
and
lacing
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
roasty
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
hop
character
and
a
noticeably
biscuity
malt
tone
the
beer
tastes
rich
with
roasted
barley
mild
bitterness
a
subdued
malty
sweetness
feels
silky
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
overall
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
though
not
mind
blowing
pretty
solid
though
i
could
easily
put
this
6
pack
down
in
an
evening
overall
it
was
alright
with
a
hamburger
at
the
flying
saucer
in
kc
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
do
think
if
the
flavors
were
kicked
up
a
notch
this
beer
could
be
a
knock
it
out
of
the
park
type
beer
taste
is
a
little
less
sweet
than
it
smells
with
a
rich
roastycaramel
malt
profile
oats
dont
go
as
thick
and
creamy
as
some
of
the
style
but
it
is
barely
full
enough
and
is
indeed
pretty
silky
touch
of
fruitiness
in
there
from
the
yeast
and
overall
is
pretty
fun
to
drink
id
say
this
is
a
darn
good
oaty
stout
but
not
in
the
top
tier
for
the
style
if
it
were
available
here
id
probably
buy
2
or
3
sixers
a
yearespecially
considering
the
lack
of
representatives
in
the
category
sold
in
tx
a
slight
acidity
on
the
tongue
is
complemented
by
good
carbonation
through
the
entire
beer
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
pretty
low
carbonation
reasonably
smooth
and
a
bit
slick
overall
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
by
any
stretch
but
solid
enough
nice
easy
drinking
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
pours
a
rich
black
with
a
hint
of
brown
when
held
to
the
light
a
dark
creamy
pillowy
head
sits
on
top
and
doesnt
dissipate
very
much
until
the
end
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
some
bitter
chocolates
the
beer
tastes
like
a
good
hearty
oatmeal
stout
should
lots
of
bitter
chocolate
a
whim
of
oats
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
for
a
stout
overall
im
proud
of
this
beer
from
my
home
state
free
state
does
a
great
job
representing
the
oatmeal
stout

overall
good

aroma
and
feel
very
dark
coffee
colored
oatmeal
stout
that
is
a
solid
beer
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
a
good
thick
head
on
top
of
the
beer
lacing
is
there
though
from
top
to
bottom
tast
is
a
little
tart
and
a
little
salty
not
much
smell
apart
from
a
hint
of
coffee
with
the
maltiness
some
acidity
it
just
lacks
a
little
bit
of
body
and
complexity
for
me
but
not
too
bad
overall
quite
drinkable
just
not
very
memorable
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
down
to
an
island
of
foam
on
the
top
of
the
beer
a
nice
patterned
lattice
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oats
and
some
cocoa
and
coffee
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
toasted
malt
up
front
with
a
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
grounds
combination
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
there
is
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
really
all
that
special
i
do
need
to
thank
james
again
for
providing
me
with
a
kansas
tick
though
drink
pretty
damn
tasty
much
more
so
than
i
remember
a
bit
thicker
than
i
remember
which
helps
this
one
taste
that
much
better
its
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
red
highlights
smell
is
rich
espresso
and
dark
caramel
taste
is
a
soft
smokiness
up
front
followed
by
a
milk
chocolate
middle
finishing
with
a
citrusy
earthy
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
overall
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
that
i
plan
to
get
again
overall
average
in
every
possible
way
i
wonder
if
it
was
an
issue
of
using
quality
ingredients
because
everything
seemed
really
weak
for
the
style
it
does
not
demonstrate
anything
other
than
a
very
safe
attempt
it
does
not
stand
out
in
any
way
really
disappointed
if
i
were
to
see
it
on
draft
i
might
give
it
a
shot
again
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
mouthfeel
is
ok
has
a
medium
body
not
as
smooth
as
id
like
or
hope
for
better
then
your
typical
stout
w
a
pretty
decent
dry
finish
drinkability
clocks
in
around
medium
id
really
like
to
see
more
oats
in
the
taste
and
a
little
less
hops
just
not
quite
as
smooth
as
id
like
from
an
oatmeal
stout
worth
picking
up
but
not
something
id
hunt
down
though
prosit
o
great
brew
for
temperamental
kansas
whether
d
interesting
oatmeal
stot
one
of
the
more
hoppy
examples
i
have
tried
pretty
good
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
it
fits
a
niche
i
would
definitely
consider
it
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
on
a
warm
summer
day
medium
body
the
same
with
the
carbonation
i
like
the
smooth
mouth
feel
and
i
find
this
oatmeal
stout
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
brew
mouthfeel
has
a
solid
medium
body
the
oats
gives
a
smooth
texture
very
easy
to
drink
this
version
is
a
lot
lighter
than
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
which
with
this
warm
weather
thats
not
a
bad
thing
i
find
that
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
while
manning
the
grill
this
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
really
need
to
get
up
to
lawrence
sample
from
the
source
od
average
at
best
this
beer
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
color
with
a
little
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
as
you
drink
the
aroma
is
strong
with
coffee
notes
the
taste
starts
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
then
moves
to
coffee
with
a
slight
caramel
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
overcarbed
and
burns
slightly
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
i
havent
had
this
in
about
two
years
but
this
is
much
better
than
i
remembered
it
being
on
tap
they
could
have
refined
it
during
those
two
years
but
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
really
a
great
representation
of
the
style
highly
recommended
12oz
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
khaki
head
aroma
of
cocoa
dark
fruit
and
caramel
also
a
little
roasty
coffee
notes
taste
is
sweet
with
a
little
roasted
bitterness
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
and
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
nice
stout
and
one
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
pours
a
deep
chunky
dark
brown
black
aroma
is
a
typical
oatmeal
malty
stout
taste
was
much
smoother
that
i
anticipated
very
very
smooth
taste
was
a
roasted
malt
very
chocolaty
smooth
mouthfeel
cant
get
over
how
smooth
it
is
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
thanks
rbald42
the
beer
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
easy
drinking
and
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
without
getting
bored
or
to
drunk
this
is
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
and
im
really
glad
that
i
got
to
this
one
fresh
as
that
mildly
aggressive
hop
profile
really
helped
make
this
one
for
me
this
stayed
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
though
as
well
i
enjoyed
this
overall
this
beer
was
better
out
of
the
tap
than
the
bottle
but
at
11
for
3
pints
and
8
for
a
sixpack
the
6er
comes
first
not
a
huge
difference
comparing
the
two
but
enough
to
notice
for
me
great
beer
free
state
does
not
come
thru
on
the
taste
or
the
body
decent
but
not
one
i
would
search
out

quickly

much

is
roasted

with
a
faint
hint
of
dark

the
taste
is
quite
plain
with
just
a
bit
of
roasted
character
the
feel
is
pretty
nice
and
creamy
drinks
well
overall
but
is
a
bit
bland
taste
is
the
same
very
nice
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
though
the
finish
is
very
dry
i
think
it
may
be
the
driest
i
have
ever
had
amazing
makes
it
better
to
be
honest
very
coffee
and
chocolate
forward
too
thin
for
my
taste
but
for
the
style
awesome
lightly
roasted
flavor
in
the
aroma
combining
with
some
dull
coffeeish
notes
nicely
creamy
medium
body
with
a
nice
light
roast
throughout

just
a
touch
of
bitterness
cocoa
powder
mid
palate
good
malt
profile
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
new
or
groundbreaking
here
this
is
definitely
a
sold
above
average
oatmeal
stout
with
a
well
above
average
drinkability
to
go
with
it
very
smooth
body
maybe
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
very
drinkable
light
oatmeal
stout
im
really
glad
these
guys
are
finally
bottling
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
i
had
certain
expectations
of
it
as
an
oatmeal
stout
more
creamy
less
dry
that
made
me
like
it
less
maybe
if
it
was
just
called
a
stout
i
might
have
rated
it
a
bit
higher
12
ounce
bottle
pouring
the
beer
it
looks
reminiscent
of
cola
with
a
nicely
building
sudsy
tan
head
you
have
to
pour
this
beer
somewhat
aggressively
to
get
any
kind
of
head
out
of
it
you
can
really
smell
the
oatmeal
in
the
nose
with
some
chocolate
and
burnt
molasses
the
flavor
to
this
beer
is
an
explosion
the
first
taste
is
amazing
with
lots
of
bittersweet
chocolate
roasted
oatmeal
and
caramel
sweetness
coming
through
theres
some
hints
of
coffee
here
though
they
are
muted
the
hops
profile
also
adds
a
light
fruitiness
to
the
whole
affair
light
mouthfeel
not
creamy
or
thick
but
drinkable
in
its
own
way
honestly
for
my
money
its
right
up
there
with
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
as
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
you
can
find
nice
light
body
for
a
light
session
stout
the
oats
dont
thicken
the
body
here
so
much
as
they
make
for
a
silkier
healthier
texture
moving
across
the
tongue
the
relatively
low
abv
helps
to
make
this
a
nice
choice
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
pints
of
a
very
good
thick
roasty
mouthfeel
was
pretty
drinkable
because
it
wasnt
too
hoppy
enjoyed
at
the
brewery
pours
near
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
is
very
oaty
with
some
chocolate
roasted

well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
again
lots
of
cocoa
oats
and
dark
malt
clean
body
is
well
carbonated
good
stuff
d
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
it
has
a
great
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
drinkability
is
fairly
high
tatse
is
good
and
alcohol
is
presumeably
low
making
for
a
nice
session

the
nose

plenty
of
coffee
with

light
in
the

with
some
fruit
and
a
nice
roast
at
the
back
with
some
bitterness
grapefruit
at
the
finish
lighter
mouth
feel
leaves
a
smoother
stout
drinking
experience
ddecent
but
this
would
be
served
better
on
nitro
a
bit
more
body
umph
couldnt
hurt
either
not
bad
but
this
place
has
better
offerings
both
of
the
free
state
brewing
company
beers
that
i
drank
with
my
lunch
yesterday
have
potential
theyre
already
good
but
they
need
more
ingredients
especially
more
malt
in
order
to
be
memorable
although
oatmeal
stout
wasnt
quite
good
enough
to
warrant
a
growler
purchase
ill
probably
order
it
again
if
i
ever
make
it
back
to
lawrence
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
oatmeal
stout
to
drink
i
like
a
lot
of
the
free

brews
draught

this
one
pours
a
very
dark
fairly
opaque
brown
with
a
tan
head
it
did
leave
some
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
somewhat
milder
there
are
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
some
roastiness

chocolate
a
nice
stout
recommended
this
oatmeal
stout
pours
smooth
and
possesses
a
small
tan
head
which
eventually
reduces
to
a
lacey
web
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
hops
with
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
it
hits
the
mouth
with
that
same
maltiness
then
transitions
to
an
expresso
chocolate
followthrough
this
stout
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
as
thick
as
some
it
definately
is
not
watery
however
this
is
a
good
stout
but
not
great

nice

brown

seeping

i
enjoyed
this
brew
the
roasted

dominate
its
taste
and
it
has
a
wonderfully
smooth
silky

just
as
guiness
has
a
worldwide
following
many
lawrence
kansas
residents
consider
this
beer
to
be
a
nectar
of
the
gods
this

on
you
free

brewery
is
a
hidden
treasure
in
the
midwest
i
am
extremely
fond
of
desserts
and
have
a
major
sweet
tooth
which
is
why
this
beer
fascinated
me
from
the
very
beginning
the
aroma
is
surely
chocolate
and
coffee
sounds
delicious
the
flavours
are
also
pretty
sweet
chocolatey
and
a
bit
of
licorice
i
am
looking
forward
to
using
this
when
i
whip
up
my
next

d
not

heavy
for
the
style
and
rather
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
certaintly
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
very
good
looking
beer
with
excellent
flavour
qualities
d
the
bottles
still
in
the
us
are
holding
up
well
i
just
wish
youngs
would
come
back
with
their
full
lineup
i
miss
them
bomber
into
an
english
pint
glass
the
pour
is
dark
black
with
some
light
through
the
edges
the
aroma
is
some
sweet
with
a
dash
of
sour
and
a
good
drop
of
salty
soy
the
flavor
has
many
layers
starting
with
sweet
and
a
bit
of
sour
followed
by
chocolate
salty
soy
and
smooth
cream
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
but
smooth
and
slick
going
down
easy
nice
drinkability
thankfully
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
as
i
hear
rumors
that
the
production
was
shut
down
if
these
rumors
are
true
i
hope
it
is
merely
temporary
d
good
flavor
great
feel
drink
it
and
enjoy
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
a
handsome
ecru
head
aroma
is
toasty
and
roasty
lots
of
breads
and
grains
and
coffee
flavor
is
dark
chocolate
and
black
coffee
with
a
medium
roasted
bitterness
and
a
light
acidity
mouthfeel
is
light
but
moussey
in
texture
making
it
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
to
the
taste
almost
like
drinking
a
rich
chocolate
milk
a
bit
of
a
smoky
nutty
aftertaste
incredible
silky
texture
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
tried
in
a
while
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
i
had
it
on
tap
and
it
came
out
great
i
would
definitely
suggest
it
too
bad
this
isnt
available
in

anymore

of
my

unusually
silky

and
complex

silky

bittersweet
smoke
finish
this
and
sammy
smiths
oatmeal
stout
are
exceptional
stouts
is
anyone
out
there
able
to
trade
either
one
of
these
beers
on
the
whole
this
isnt
a
spectacular
oatmeal
stout
but
its
certainly
a
strong
example
of
the
style
i
got
the
bottle
for
2
bucks
on
clearance
and
might
just
go
pick
up
a
couple
more
for
what
its
worth
a
half
liter
bottle
poured
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
light
tan
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
and
tastes
of
bitter
sharp
roasted
grains
molasses
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
a
notch
above
medium
in
body
and
a
bit
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
i
dont
know
not
great
but
not
bad
i
could
drink
this
but
there
seem
to
be
more
flavorful
and
creamy
examples
of
this
style
out
there
the
taste
is
thick
caramelly
malt
fresh
toast
dark
chocolate
fudge
with
a
mild
coffee
and
drier
chocolate
coming
up
near
the
end
it
is
fairly
sweet
with
only
light
bitterness
its
fullbodied
and
silky
in
feel
rich
head
that
stuck
around
very
good
combo
overall
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
one
for
a
stout
i
could
have
a
few
and
its
by
no
means
overpowering
d
if
i
could
cut
the
carbonation
in
half
this
would
be
a
sure
fire
a
rated
beer
for
me
but
i
cant
so
i
have
to
mark
it
down
maybe
next
time
ill
let
the
bottle
breath
for
30
minutes
before
i
partake
i
hope
this
one
didnt
get
retired
this
is
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
right
up
there
with
samuel
smith
i
wonder
what
a
fresher
one
tastes
like
perhaps
i
will
never
know
mfd
no
true
complaints
here
no
real
praise
either
the
feel
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
for
to
complement
the
intense
taste
of
choco
the
carbonation
is
great
real
crisp
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
quite
often
if
given
sufficient
funding
pours
a
viscous
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
shortlived
beige
head
aroma
of
cocoa
oatmeal
roasted
malt
and
some
coffee
more
malt
and
semisweet
chocolate
in
the
taste
with
strong
smoke
flavors
leather
fuggles
and
oats
follow
long
sweet
finish
very
nice
summary
very
smooth
very
creamy
very
flavorful
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
and
personally
i
enjoy
it
even
more
than
youngs
very
popular
double
chocolate
please
note
that
as
it
warms
the
beer
gets
maltier
and
maltier
tasting
in
my
opinion
it
is
best
slightly
cooler
than
normal
and
not
allowed
to
overwarm
d
very
smooth
light
but
rich
in
dark
roasted
flavor
makes
this
an
oatmeal
with
good
smooth
drinkability
highly
drinkable
stays
interesting
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
young
is
a
pretty
large
british
brewery
and
fairly
common
on
that
side
of
the
pond
over
here
theyre
mostly
known
for
their
desserty
double
chocolate
stout
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
nearly
black
until
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
it
has
a
thin
head
which
fails
to
persist
its
pleasingly
smooth
but
has
a
bit
of
bite
definite
chocolate
malt
notes
here
not
much
much
bitterness
but
the
sweetness
isnt
overwhelming
over
all
its
mild
with
a
slight
toasty
aftertaste
id
recommend
this
ale
for
someone
whos
looking
to
get
into
the
style
as
its
highly
drinkable
but
typifies
oatmeal
stouts
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
amber
edges
and
a
thick
foamy
beige
head
aroma
of
oatmeal
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
flavor
very
similar
to
aroma
again
dominated
by
roasted
chocolate
maltiness
caramel
and
oatmeal
dry
finish
i
really
enjoyed
youngs
oatmeal
stout
because
of
the
rich
but
also
smooth
taste
that
it
has
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
and
its
possible
to
smell
the
malts
and
chocolate
this
is
also
one
of
the
more
fullerbodied
stouts
that
i
have
tried
which
provided
an
overall
solid
taste
not
much
aftertaste
either
highly
recommended
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
veryclose
to
black
opaque
maroon
color
with
a
mochacolored
head
moderate
retention
and
scattered
sheets
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
malty
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
malt
with
some
horseblanket
mustiness
the
roasted
malt
character
really
comes
through
on
the
tongue
in
a
smoky
way
with
hints
of
sweetness
in
the
chocolate
malt
good
balance
of
hops
bitterness
towards
the
end
in
the
form
of
coffee
flavors
and
though
not
complex
quite
solid
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
the
carbonation
spoton
though
the
body
could
be
a
bit
heavier
and
it
is
slightly
acidic
for
the
style
a
pleasant
beer
however
and
not
so
dense
or
demanding
that
one
could
not
enjoy
a
few
had
this
ontap
at
cellarmans
before
they
couldnt
get
it
anymore
and
now
i
hear
they
arent
making
this
anymore
and
im
somewhat
upset
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
drink
this
lately
great
tasting
beer
pours
dark
with
a
nice
thick

that
is
there
for
a
while

very
smooth

that
i
would
love
to
find
on

in

nitrocan
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this

i
ever
find
it
again

was
a
pleasant
surprise
mediumthick
lumpy
head
that
reveals
most
of
the
aroma
right
off
the
bat
a
good
mix
of
coffee
and
wood
nose
but
also
hides
something
else
that
i
just
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
youngs
says
the
finish
is
similar
to
toast
and
i
cant
really
disagree
except
maybe
burnt
toast
but
not
in
a
bad
way
more
like
the
burnt
toast
that
you
end
scraping
all
the
black
off
and
buttering
up
and
eating
anyway
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
actual
taste
it
lacks
that
true
oatmeal
stout
creamydreamy
mouth
feell
im
a
big
fan
of
youngs
brews
and
maybe
my
expectations
were
a
little
too
high
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
beyond
mediumbodied
and
i
could
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
its
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
on
the
planet
but
its
good
stuff
nonetheless
a
twofinger

a

with
the

this
is

the
smoothest

creamiest

stouts
ive
had
and
the
taste
is
really
packs
a
punch
also
it
is
a
sweet
taste
like
chocolate
or
vanilla
mixed
with
the
oat
malt
and
still
just
enough
hops
and
roasted
malts
to
give
it
a
passing
dry
backbite
i
could
session
this
anytime
extremely
smooth
well
crafted
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
put
several
of
these
down
without
realizing
it
i
am
now
a
fan
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
like
others
of
this
style
it
weighs
you
down
but
its
still
a
well
done
brew
this
was
a
good
beer
went
to
a
tap
room
in
mcqueeney
tx
called
the
silver
eagle
nice
bar
very
empty
though
because
the
owner
in
recent
years
has
voiced
and
pushed
his
opinion
on
politics
on
everybody
although
he
was
a
nice
gentleman
and
has
a
grand
taste
in
beer
he
did
not
fail
to
remind
me
and
everyone
that
he
had
the
last
two
kegs
of
this
beer
in
texas
its
a
good
beer
basic
full
stout
i
love
stouts
so
this
did
not
disappoint
in
the
very
least
it
was
a
little
thin
though
it
might
be
that
these
kegs
were
from
many
years
ago
i
didnt
ask
if
you
get
a
hold
of
one
by
chance
take
a
drink
or
two
it
might
be
your
last
especially
in
texas
i
may
seem
biased
towards
this
beer
but
thats
only
because
i
am
biased
towards
this
beer
it
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
and
will
undoubtably
continue
to
be
throughout
my
life
for
me
it
defines
the
oatmeal
stout
genre
and
gives
me
a
point
of
refrence
for
reviewing
other
similar
stouts
try
it
its
extraordinary
d
perfect
to
have
a
pint
or
two
of
this
stuff
one
pint
is
enought
for
me
today
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
albeit
a
little
thin
i
find
myself
finishing
the
beer
way
faster
than
i
set
out
to
very
smooth
and
drinkable
mid
to
full
body
good
amount
of
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
a
favorable
category
for
me
i
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
again
yet
one
more
fine
product
by
youngs
rich
aroma
bittersweet
and
roasty
decent
pour
with
a
good
creamy
tan
head
would
like
to
see
some
more
lacing
though
mouthfeel
is
good
and
smooth
could
be
thicker
great
flavor
very
sweet
for
a
stout
which
is
a
nice
change
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
mild
chocolate
with
a
bitter
end
very
solid
stout
here
although
ill
take
the
double
chocolate
if
given
a
choice
youngs
oatmeal
stout
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
very
nice
brown
head
smelled
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
hops
taste
was
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
mouthfeel
was
good
for
the
style
think
coating
drinkability
was
ok
very
thick
good
overall
oatmeal
stout
d
i
could
only
have
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
a
great
tasting
beer
and
i
will
be
buying
more
overall
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
a
great
combination
of
all
flavors
that
mix
well
and
dont
overpower
any
aspect
of
the
brew
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
highly
reccommended
could
drink
this
all
night
long
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
epic
either
mfd
thick
and
flavorful
coates
the
mouth
well
highly
recommended
poured
from
550ml
bottle
into
pint
glass
dark
opaque
appearance
with
light
head
that
holds
for
some
time
before
dissipating
into
a
fine
lacing
smell
is
exactly
what
to
expect
of
an
oatmeal
stout
taste
neither
surprises
or
disappoints
mouthfeel
is
very
typical
if
not
the
atypical
oatmeal
stout
smooth
and
rich
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
its
a
pleasant
drinkable
stout
that
doesnt
offend
but
doesnt
present
pleasant
surprises
either
not
quite
samuel
smiths
but
just
below
the
british
really
no
how
to
make
a
semi
macro
quality
stout
excellent
drinkability
great
overall
one
beer
that
offers
many
qualities
throughout
the
beer
overall
this
is
the
first
of
the
kind
that
ive
tried
and
itll
definitely
bring
me
back
to
oatmeal
stouts
as
a
style
id
like
to
continue
tasting
in
the
future
d
stouts
have
always
been
a
little
too
intense
for
me
but
this
one
balances
very
well
i
certainly
rather
have
a
night
of
these
than
other
stouts
ive
tried
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
once
again
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
stout
flavorful
and
light
enough
for
a
session
beer
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
sipping
just
one
as
well
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
is
samuel
smith
but
if
i
was
going
to
be
swilling
pints
all
night
i
would
take
this
one
d
one
of
my
favorites
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
sam
smiths
but
its
debatable
i
have
had
a
hard
time
finding
this
beer
as
apposesed
to
the
chocolate
stout
which
is
easy
to
get
i
highly
recommend
this
this
looks
gorgeous
with
a
pitch
black
body
a
thick
tan
head
that
never
dies
and
fullglass
lacing
the
aroma
however
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
i
just
get
a
light
dusty
smell
without
much
coffee
or
chocolate
the
flavor
is
also
pretty
mild
with
most
of
the
taste
coming
late
with
smooth
but
bitter
cocoa
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
youngs
oatmeal
stout
and
i
wish
id
sprung
for
it
sooner
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
comparable
in
quality
to
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
and
i
cant
give
much
higher
praise
than
that
mouthfeel
slightly
chewy
and
thick
but
finishes
very
nicely
with
a
roasted
warmness
it
feels
like
the
hot
cocoa
of
beer
d
easy
to
drink
but
if
left
me
wanting
more
definitely
a
prime
example
of
the
style
one
to
seek
out
i
would
like
to
try
it
in
the
can
sometime
as
well
drinkability
5
2
a
great
oatmeal
that
is
dry
but
has
some
nice
sweetness
as
well
d
nicely
crafted
in
the
great
tradition
of
youngs
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
a
very
good
stout
and
very
drinkable
well
worth
the
purchase
d
light
and
drinkable
but
id
have
to
give
a
nod
to
any
of
a
half
dozen
other
oatmeal
stouts
above
this
one
above
average
and
drinkable
if
nothing
else
is
around
drinkablity
great
flavor
in
an
easily
available
brew
the
flavor
is
money
smooth
creamy
and
delicious
it
has
a
shortness
in
the
mouth
and
doesnt
stay
long
but
the
thought
of
how
good
it
was
is
still
in
your
mind
you
taste
a
faint
chocolate
as
well
overall
a
wicked
solid
brew
i
would
recommend
it
anyone
who
is
a
oatmeal
stout
fan
drinkability
easy
to
drink
not
particularly
my
style
but
i
think
it
would
be
good
in
the
fall
with
a
bonfire
or
something
drinkability
very
nice
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
tried
this
and
i
am
even
more
impressed
now
than
i
was
several
years
ago
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
malts
some
toasted
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
delivers
the
same
for
this
beer
with
a
rich
roasted
malt
backbone
hints
of
toasted
oatmeal
a
nice
sweet
chocolatey
hint
and
then
balanced
out
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
it
has
a
very
velvety
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
warms
as
it
goes
down
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
this
is
one
excellent
oatmeal
stout
definately
worth
the
try
i
just
wish
i
could
try
it
in
the
nitrocan
notes
is
it
just
me
or
is
youngs
just
a
massively
underrated
brewery
d
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
i
like
it
but
it
some
how
doesnt
match
the
hype
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
pours
a
very
nice
opaqueblack
color
with
a
huge
head
nice
lacing
and
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
it
has
a
very
nice
burnt
grainoatmeal
scent
although
very
slight
its
a
very
smooth
stout
slightly
creamy
with
a
nice
burnt
grain
and
bit
of
oatmeal
flavor
its
extremely
smooth
and
an
excellent
oatmeal
stout
pours
dark
dark
red
with
a
sizable
tan
head
that
sticks
around
with
some
solid
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
tastes
the
same
with
some
hops
thrown
in
right
on
target
this
is
one
rich
oatmeal
stout
an
extremely
pleasant
surprise
i
wasnt
expecting
much
as
i
dont
really
enjoy
their
double
chocolate
stout
but
this
is
terrific
brew
all
in
all
a
good
beer
this
brew
although
the
summed
magnitude
of
flavor
was
expectably
subdue
as
many
english
offering
are
the
direction
that
flavor
took
was
right
on
delicate
unrefined
soft
boisterous
seductive
and
distant
all
describe
this
beer
i
couldnt
enjoy
it
on
an
everyday
basis
but
every
onceandalongwhile
it
really
hits
the
spot
let
this
one
warm
up
super
cold
no
go
flavor
really
comes
out
now
453
reviews
as
of
this
writting
this
is
a
classic
english
oatmeal
stout
and
definitely
worthy
enjoying
the
grass
looks
greaner
but
this
classic
is
a
fine
choice
everytime
i
love
how
smooth
this
is
and
how
rich
in
flavor
this
low
abv
beer
is
i
recommend
this
highly
wells
and
young
1
pt
bottle
cant
believe
i
have
never
rated
this
one
before
almost
deep
black
in
appearance
but
at
closer
glance
this
has
garnet
accents
nice
looking
tan
head
nice
toastyroasty
malt
aromas
with
a
good
deal
of
cereal
in
the
back
again
toasty
malt
dominated
flavours
with
a
tinge
of
bittersweet
chocolate
black
coffee
and
again
the
cereal
well
carbonated
for
a
stout
but
still
nice
on
the
palate
a
nice
drinkable
stout
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
brown
that
left
a
very
this
brown
head
with
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
smell
was
of
dough
and
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
undertones
the
mouthfeel
was
suprisingly
light
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
i
hope
to
enjoy
agian
and
agian
d
an
excellent
brew
by
all
means
i
prefer
a
sweeter
version
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
would
definitely
not
pass
this
up
black
pour
basically
with
a
thick
brown
staying
head
pours
viscous
and
almost
syrupy
smells
a
touch
sweet
roasty
malty
rich
and
hearty
has
a
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
with
some
nice
light
oat
flavor
overall
it
is
actually
a
touch
bland
and
the
flavors
dont
pop
out
at
you
not
the
most
flavorful
stout
but
it
is
rich
creamy
and
easier
to
drink
than
most
after
reading
the
bottle
i
did
notice
the
slight
toast
like
aftertaste
and
its
something
i
could
definitely
have
again
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
drinking
this
but
i
was
extremely
surprised
at
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
awesome
was
the
first
words
out
of
my
mouth
the
roasted
grains
really
come
through
a
medium
body
to
this
beer
makes
it
really
drinkable
i
only
wish
now
i
would
have
bought
two
of
them
it
may
have
been
a
little
too
simple
in
the
feel
and
while
its
not
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
ever
had
its
certainly
the
most
drinkable
youngs
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
dense
dark
black
the
smell
is
rather
average
yielding
a
moderately
strong
roasted
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
mildly
malted
and
has
no
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
mildly
carbonated
this
seems
to
be
a
rather
smooth
and
mellow
oatmeal
stout
making
it
quite
pleasant
to
drink
on
first
taste
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
highly
recommended
this
is
a
nice
contrast
to
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
which
is
considerably
smoother
and
sweeter
the
oatmeal
has
a
nice
clean
bite
to
it
that
i
like
i
dont
know
that
i
would
want
to
drink
this
one
often
but
in
my
humble
opinion
this
one
is
very
good
this
is
a
nice
quaffable
stout
that
i
enjoyed
at
the
ginger
man
in
houston
this
is
not
the
best
stout
i
have
ever
had
but
good
none
the
less
still
quaffable
nevertheless
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
jet
black
with
a
tan
rolicky
head
that
slowly
dissipates
not
alot
of
aroma
present
slight
hint
of
oats
and
roasted
barley
slight
lacing
present
taste
starts
dry
and
finishes
slightly
chocolatey
medium
bodied
with
good
drinkability
d
this
one
isnt
what
i
expected
but
i
still
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
would
drink
it
again
this
one
got
a
lot
better
for
me
over
the
course
of
40
minutes
of
warming
black
as
espresso
with
a
beige
head
just
like
an
exemplary
stout
should
be
aromas
of
toasted
malt
and
coffee
in
the
nose
taste
is
smooth
chocolatey
but
not
like
the
utterly
disgusting
youngs
chocolate
stout
and
creamy
only
the
barest
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
i
cant
really
taste
the
oatmeal
per
se
but
i
assume
some
of
the
creaminess
is
due
to
it
a
fine
straight
up
the
middle
stout
highly
drinkable
better
than
guinness
i
think
id
have
to
drink
them
back
to
back
to
really
tell
the
difference
overall
a
good
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
but
certainly
not
the
best
representation
of
the
syle
this
sample
has
nothing
on
samuel
smiths
nice
ebony
jetblack
appearance
with
a
tan
frothy
head
smell
as
expected
is
complete
with
dark
cocoa
and
espresso
notes
taste
strongly
complements
the
aroma
with
dark
burntchocolate
darkcappuccino
flavors
that
are
rich
and
tasty
would
certainly
go
great
with
sweets
and
chocolate
candy
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
hoping
for
somewhat
bland
compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
ive
sampled
good
stuff
and
not
bad
at
all
youngs
winter
warmer
was
superb
and
although
this
was
not
disappointing
wasnt
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
better
out
there
but
this
was
certainly
worth
a
try
this
has
long
been
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
and
i
have
had
it
numerous
times
in
the
past
but
i
am
just
now
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
the
beer
pours
with
some
of
the
most
substantial
tan
head
i
have
ever
seen
in
any
beer
it
floats
on
a
deep
black
body
the
nose
is
of
coffee
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
dark
chocolate
sweetness
the
taste
is
first
of
roasted
coffee
flavor
followed
by
sweet
toasted
malts
and
grain
really
simple
but
really
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
classic
stout
it
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
carbonation
the
beer
on
the
whole
is
incredibly
well
balanced
with
simple
flavors
topped
off
with
a
gorgeous
appearance
something
is
terribly
wrong
here
this
is
one
of
the
higher
rated
oatmeal
stouts
on
this
site
but
it
tastes
terrible
to
me
there
must
be
a
problem
with
the
bottle
or
something
i
am
cooling
down
a
sam
smith
os
right
now
to
get
some
perspective
if
this
is
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
taste
then
wow
sam
smith
os
blows
it
out
of
the
water
i
have
noticed
many
other
reviewers
have
had
a
similar
problem
and
questioned
the
integrity
of
the
beer
the
roasted
barley
is
nice
but
thats
all
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
ive
not
been
a
huge
stout
fan
in
the
past
the
flavor
was
just
delicious
enough
and
not
too
harsh
that
i
could
keep
drinking
it
at
the
pace
i
wanted
this
beer
i
tend
to
favor
a
bit
too
much
for
the
flavor
savoring
but
it
was
overall
a
very
delicious
and
well
made
beer
d
very
pleasant
stout
easy
to
drink
when
the
temperature
dips
i
think
it
actually
cured
a
wee
cough
i
had
d
highly
drinkable
smooth
and
not
as
intense
as
other
stouts
i
wish
it
had
a
more
strongly
roasted
flavor
but
other
than
that
i
would
reach
for
this
in
a
second
if
i
were
jonesing
for
a
stout
and
couldnt
find
sam
smith
poured
from
bottle
into
chalice
pours
black
with
nice
thick
fluffy
mocha
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
rich
in
chocolate
roasted
grain
and
what
seems
to
be
a
touch
of
raisin
or
tart
fruit
there
also
seems
to
be
a
french
vanilla
smell
as
well
like
a
coffee
creamer
taste
is
good
but
a
little
watery
i
thought
strong
taste
of
nuts
chocolate
toasted
grain
and
a
slight
coffee
presence
very
thick
mouthfeel
and
suprisingly
left
a
somewhat
dry
feel
in
the
mouth
which
seemed
out
of
place
overall
a
very
good
beer
if
it
were
a
little
bit
more
creamy
then
this
would
be
a
contender
for
a
perfect
5
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
likes
darker
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
i
would
love
to
sample
right
from
the
tap
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
is
presented
well
via
a
bottle
offering
nicely
done
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
20oz
glass
this
appears
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
full
dark
brown
head
that
subsides
after
about
five
minutes
to
leave
a
thin
film
of
colour
on
top
of
the
beer
throughout
the
duration
and
which
leaves
a
good
degree
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
delicate
and
pleasant
with
notes
of
coffee
and
the
roasted
malt
that
hits
you
with
the
first
mouthful
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
indeed
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
finish
as
the
beer
goes
down
leaving
an
aftertaste
that
takes
a
long
time
to
vanish
if
you
like
dark
beers
this
one
is
definitely
worth
adding
to
your
repetoire
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
presented
as
dark
brown
almost
black
and
opaque
luscious
cocoacolored
head
fluffy
and
thick
with
generous
lacing
throughout
the
tasting
scents
of
malt
and
molasses
taste
similar
to
nose
with
the
addition
of
coffee
undertones
full
silky
mouthfeel
but
not
at
all
chewy
very
refreshing
and
crisp
finish
somewhat
uncharacteristic
of
the
style
in
which
flavors
tend
to
linger
very
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
definitely
one
of
the
better
that
ive
had
overall
very
smooth
and
drinkable
not
overly
bitter
or
strong
in
any
one
characteristic
drinkability
pretty
good
beer
had
this
with
a
steak
and
cheese
sandwich
good
try
but
might
not
buy
again
because
it
wasnt
that
good
or
maybe
i
just
need
to
try
more
oatmeal
stouts
to
comprte
it
to
d
i
havent
had
an
oatmeal
stout
in
some
time
and
was
pleased
to
be
able
to
enjoy
this
one
so
many
quality
characteristics
in
this
beer
make
it
drinkable
from
its
flavorful
yet
gentle
taste
to
its
delightful
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
stout
nothing
kicks
away
the
chill
of
fall
or
winter
like
one
of
these
d
very
drinkable
will
buy
again
and
again
this
is
a
great
beer
the
beer
pours
black
the
bottle
claims
it
only
appears
black
from
a
distance
thats
wrong
its
black
from
right
up
close
it
has
a
smallish
head
but
with
pretty
decent
retention
the
foam
clings
to
the
glass
long
after
the
beer
has
descended
the
bottle
claims
a
fruity
aroma
and
a
sense
of
toast
breakfast
beer
awesome
but
i
detect
neither
if
there
is
any
fruit
it
is
very
faint
both
in
smell
and
taste
its
the
roasted
malts
that
identify
this
beer
maybe
the
slightest
hint
of
chocolate
maybe
very
light
coffee
tones
i
dropped
it
some
point
in
the
mouthfeel
department
because
the
beer
is
a
bit
crisp
a
little
too
much
tingle
on
the
palate
for
me
a
nice
roasted
malt
after
taste
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
rounds
out
this
beer
d
two
bottles
of
this
on
a
cold
night
with
a
hearty
winters
stew
is
what
my
doctor
ordered
when
i
called
him
and
said
i
felt
bad
it
did
the
trick
pours
dark
opaque
with
minimal
head
lacing
is
readily
apparent
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
grain
with
overtones
of
dark
dried
fruit
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
it
has
more
of
a
dry
taste
a
roasty
bitter
chocolate
with
a
moderate
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
even
with
nothing
to
eat
a
good
stand
alone
beer
that
i
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
serve
to
friends
d
this
is
a
fantastically
drinkable
stout
good
with
food
or
alone
i
wanted
some
old
rasputin
but
the
fresh
market
i
go
to
was
out
so
i
tried
something
new
good
choice
d
a
wonderful
session
stout
my
only
regret
is
that
i
bought
only
one
bottle
certainly
this
will
be
on
my
recommended
list
and
with
future
confirmation
it
could
easily
be
a
favorite
the
brewers
website
describes
a
recent
merger
with
wells
and
today
i
could
not
find
mention
of
the
oatmeal
stout
on
their
list
of
brews
i
hope
this
does
not
foretell
the
loss
of
this
great
beer
from
their
line
d
very
drinkable
if
you
are
a
fan
of
oatmeal
stouts
this
could
possibly
be
very
close
to
the
benchmark
for
the
style
this
beer
poured
a
thick
black
with
a
big
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
caramel

perhaps
a
bit
of
roasted
notes
can
be
detected
the
taste
is
initially
very
roastedburnt
coffee
tasting
which
mellows
quickly
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
that
helps
balance
the
initial
bitter
shock
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
overall
this
is
a
nice
roasted
tasting
stout
that
i
would
consider
drinkable
because
of
the
smooth
finish
overall
i
like
this
beer
with
an
okay
drinkablity
it
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
not
overpowering
in
any
way
reminds
me
more
of
a
regular
stout
but
i
can
feel
the
oatmeal
existed
within
the
mash
i
like
the
smell
as
it
is
sweet
but
not
overly
as
it
would
seem
unsweetened
chocolate
exists
by
the
time
my
beer
was
gone
the
lacing
decipated
to
nothing
but
a
couple
spots
d
not
my
first
choice
oatmeal
stout
but
still
good
if
i
was
in
london
during
winter
again
id
probably
drink
this
fairly
often
a
nice
stout
had
a
bit
of
a
twang
to
it
not
sure
if
it
was
this
bottle
or
if
its
supposed
to
be
there
will
revisit
someday
d
i
think
it
is
a
good
brew
but
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
d
i
dont
think
i
will
be
trying
this
again
i
got
the
bottle
at
specs
for
over
three
dollars
and
at
my
dinner
party
tonight
during
cocktail
hour
i
ended
up
giving
the
rest
of
my
pint
to
my
motherinlaw
who
doesnt
care
for
beer
but
liked
whatever
it
was
i
was
drinking
after
letting
her
try
it
i
wanted
to
try
and
find
something
for
fall
drinking
so
it
looks
like
ill
have
to
keep
looking
then
again
im
not
usually
a
stout
drinker
served
chilled
in
a
bulb
drinkability
not
nearly
as
fullbodied
complex
or
flavorful
as
other
oatmeal
stouts
drinkable
not
for
me
its
not
bad
but
not
good
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
chocolate
making
way
for
a
dry
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
acidic
but
still
very
drinkable
served
from
a
chilled
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
appears
much
like
coffee
dark
roast
with
a
robust
tannish
chocolatemilkyhead
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
nicely
as
it
dissipates
a
grainy
roasted
malt
on
the
nose
along
with
some
toasted
peanuts
or
almonds
and
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
actually
beechnut
flavor
is
mostly
mild
and
sweet
with
a
roasty
grainy
flavor
coming
first
and
backed
by
a
smokey
beechwood
flavor
toward
the
finish
that
tends
to
stick
around
as
the
aftertaste
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
as
well
tasted
body
is
medium
at
most
with
a
nice
balance
maybe
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
actually
for
a
stout
is
right
on
point
fairly
drinkable
and
as
drinkable
as
most
stouts
are
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
the
oatmeal
flavor
but
overall
i
like
this
one
drinkability
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
i
picked
this
up
after
having
had
youngs
double
chocolate
stoutwhich
i
did
enjoy
but
this
is
disappointing
compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
pours
an
opaque
black
with
red
highlights
little
bubbles
coalesce
into
larger
ones
which
pop
and
leave
little
divots
in
the
light
brown
twofinger
head
leaves
rings
of
lacing
as
i
drink
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
taste
is
roasted
malt
bitterness
with
milk
chocolate
its
toasty
with
some
caramel
the
edges
are
nicely
rounded
by
the
oats
the
biggest
disappointment
with
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
expect
an
oatmeal
stout
to
be
thick
and
chewy
velvety
even
this
one
just
wasnt
it
was
thin
and
watery
was
a
little
creamy
but
didnt
hang
around
on
the
palate
long
overall
this
was
a
fairly
enjoyable
oatmeal
stout
but
not
the
first
id
reach
for
in
this
style
this
one
pours
out
black
with
two
fingers
of
a
creamy
light
brown
head
very
attractive
the
aroma
is
of
oats
and
other
grains
a
little
sweet
and
roasted
in
addition
upon
tasting
i
noticed
some
dark
chocolate
hints
but
a
sort
of
generic
stoutiness
as
it
warmed
though
it
improved
becoming
richer
in
flavor
and
gaining
an
aftertaste
that
was
absent
at
first
it
became
creamier
in
the
mouth
as
time
went
on
too
as
it
began
quite
crisp
overall
it
was
a
very
pleasant
experience
this
is
a
very
fine
stout
that
is
extremely
drinkable
i
do
love
a
big
heavy
imperial
stout
but
this
is
just
so
smooth
and
refreshing
that
its
a
wonderful
change
for
me
for
a
stout
drink
up
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
ill
still
choose
sam
smiths
but
this
a
very
solid
brew
to
enjoy
d
better
than
the
average
beer
but
there
are
far
far
better
oatmeal
stouts
than
this
try
a
highland
or
a
sam
smiths
if
you
want
a
good
example
of
the
style
my
wife
remarked
that
it
looked
like
a
root
beer
float
in
a
pint
glass
overall
a
superior
stout
beautiful
setup
excellent
flavor
profile
and
superior
drinkability
drinkability
very
good
and
mellow
repeat
easily
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
so
far
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
lasts
for
a
short
time
aroma
is
one
of
roasted
grainsoatmeal
with
even
some
hints
of
coffee
taste
is
pretty
much
similar
with
a
lot
of
coffeeoatmeal
flavor
to
it
nice
smooth
and
roasty
i
dont
get
to
try
too
many
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
do
think
this
one
is
decent
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
this
one
again
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
perfect
brew
for
drinkers
who
are
unfamiliar
with
oatmeal
stouts
and
need
a
more
restrained
brew
before
trying
the
more
rich
ones
for
oatmeal
stout
fans
this
one
does
an
exceptional
job
with
handling
the
roastiness
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
while
not
getting
too
bitter
or
sweet
youngs
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
d
quite
a
tasty
brew
that
is
very
enjoyable
overall
its
like
having
a
good
hearty
meal
and
why
not
its
oatmeal
well
done
beautiful
near
black
with
the
slightest
light
showing
through
this
beer
had
a
3
in
head
poured
correctly
with
eternal
lacing
smell
was
sweet
and
fruity
detecting
a
tart
grape
odor
as
if
aged
in
a
wine
barrel
taste
was
rather
dull
yet
balanced
with
little
bitter
taste
and
more
coffee
mocha
than
anything
very
little
complexity
mouthfeel
was
suprisingly
light
leaving
only
some
mild
bitterness
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
does
not
live
up
to
its
look
and
smell
not
bad
but
there
are
better
examples
of
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
i
was
lucky
enough
to
enjoy
this
fresh
on
tap
at
the
old
youngs
brewery
served
in
a
traditional
pint
glass
it
has
a
very
dark
color
almost
black
it
has
a
very
thick
creamy
head
with
a
sweet
but
very
light
aroma
of
honey
the
taste
is
excellent
slightly
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
it
has
a
full
flavor
across
the
palate
excellent
stuff
the
beers
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
good
head
that
lasts
the
smell
of
roasted
barley
is
very
strong
in
this
brew
bringing
out
a
strong
coffee
scent
and
burned
toast
sweet
chocoalte
notes
are
hinted
in
the
taste
but
it
revolves
around
the
bitterness
of
the
roasted
barely
mixed
in
is
a
hop
leaf
flavor
and
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
alcohol
adds
a
mixed
fruit
flavor
to
the
profile
a
bitter
lingering
on
the
palate
brings
flavors
of
bitter
coffee
and
chalk
overall
i
enjoyed
this
surprisingly
strong
offering
from
youngs
the
beer
poured
black
as
night
into
a
pint
glass
leaving
a
head
that
could
stay
for
weeks
the
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
full
of
roasted
malt
and
other
subtle
flavors
the
taste
is
smooth
first
bitter
later
but
not
too
bitter
you
could
spend
a
whole
night
trying
to
figure
out
what
this
tastes
like
as
it
seems
very
familiar
very
enjoyable
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
but
hardly
very
praiseworthy
in
my
opinion
a
bit
better
than
average
too
much
bitterness
and
a
bit
too
watery
no
major
complaints
but
id
just
rather
get
something
that
i
liked
more
in
the
fiture
easily
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
while
poured
ink
black
with
no
light
passing
through
thick
rocky
sand
coloured
head
which
remained
for
several
minutes
smell
was
dark
malts
black
earth
toasted
oats
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
deep
down
taste
was
sweet
with
dark
malts
semisweet
chocolate
coffee
grounds
and
breakfast
oatmeal
hop
bitterness
is
very
faint
but
present
nevertheless
mouthfeel
is
very
solid
but
not
too
heavy
this
is
a
very
sessionable
stout
im
quite
pleased
with
it
and
will
certainly
buy
this
again
drinkability
i
would
like
a
little
more
velvety
smoothness
from
an
oatmeal
stout
the
oats
are
barely
present
not
bad
but
nothing
memorable
the
best
thing
about
thid
beer
is
the
looks
its
mighty
good
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
mild
and
dry
without
the
sweetness
if
thats
youre
thing
drinkability
easy
drinking
a
mild
yet
hearty
stout
wellbalanced
but
its
still
has
that
distinct
london
mineral
character
and
as
always
the
youngs
rams
head
on
the
bottle
and
cap
kicks
ass
this
is
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
though
not
one
of
my
favorites
to
me
the
flavors
werent
quite
as
robust
as
i
would
like
still
its
enjoyable
enough
and
would
make
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
brunch
there
is
something
in
the
smell
of
stouts
and
porters
that
make
me
think
of
a
butchers
shop
and
this
goes
for
youngs
oatmeal
stout
as
well
the
smell
is
actually
very
good
with
notes
of
bread
grass
and
roasted
malts
as
well
the
taste
is
dominated
by
charcoal
and
oatmeal
i
suppose
it
is
dry
and
not
sweet
one
can
almost
taste
the
grains
it
has
a
full
and
sturdy
body
but
the
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
not
as
full
as
the
name
indicates
but
its
definately
a
very
decent
stout
personally
i
like
a
stoutporter
that
is
not
sweet
paragon
of
the
style
lots
of
craft
in
this
beer
even
a
bottle
that
makes
it
all
the
way
to
california
m
very
good
lighter
body
than
the
taste
would
suggest
tiny
bubbles
of
carboration
moderately
carborated
lovely
stout
poured
into
a
aventinus
glass
a
nice
clear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
a
nice
2
finger
plus
tannish
foamy
head
which
then
left
some
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
dry
and
malty
there
is
also
a
nice
touch
of
sweetnessbitterness
to
the
flavor
medium
body
very
drinkable
only
my
second
youngs
brew
to
date
highly
recommend
when
poured
into
the
glass
the
color
was
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
fair
amount
of
tight
dark
tan
foam
the
smell
of
roasted
malt
and
fruit
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
oatmeal
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
not
bitter
or
sour
but
not
sweet
either
a
well
balanced
stout
that
i
would
recommend
in
the
future
to
any
lover
of
stout
one
of
my
first
and
still
favorites
oatmeal
stouts
the
relatively
low
abv
makes
for
a
great
session
stout
if
you
are
so
inclined
great
on
cold
pa
sunday
afternoon
this
may
soon
be
a
memory
as
the
brewery
sort
of
went
out
of
business
or
more
accurately
is
merging
with
a
rival
charles
wells
the
new
company
will
be
the
wells
and
young
brewing
company
so
i
rushed
back
to
the
norhcoast
coop
here
in
eureka
ca
for
a
bolttle
of
the
oatmeal
stout
sad
sort
of
like
seeing
a
species
go
extinct
as
a
touch
of
irony
the
chairman
charles
yound
died
on
sept
17
2006
just
eight
days
before
the
brewery
closed
was
it
worth
it
to
go
grab
the
bottle
darn
right
poured
a
nice
black
with
a
big
tan
head
big
nose
of
burnt
malts
and
chocolate
rich
mouthfeel
nice
bitter
finish
so
long
youngs
pours
a
pretty
dark
brownlight
black
good
slight
offcolor
head
that
leaves
quicker
than
i
feel
it
should
have
alright
lacing
but
that
kind
of
left
quik
as
well
a
strong
aroma
of
chocolate
is
immediate
the
flavor
spreads
quickly
all
across
tongue
in
a
thick
roasted
taste
as
the
beer
warmed
the
chocolate
really
seemed
to
stick
out
and
a
hint
of
perhaps
coffee
a
somewhat
dry
aftertaste
but
not
to
bad
this
would
go
great
with
a
thick
tbone
pours
dark
rich
black
with
dark
brown
tinting
at
the
sides
full
dark
cream
colored
head
slowly
falls
to
a
18
inch
disc
smells
of
coffee
barley
and
cocoa
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
the
inital
flavor
one
of
coffee
and
roasted
barley
giving
way
to
a
brief
hoppy
taste
and
finishing
with
a
somewhat
crisp
cocoa
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
without
feeling
heavy
and
the
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
drinkability
is
amazing
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
night
if
i
paced
myself
overall
this
is
definitely
a
beer
ill
be
having
again
in
the
future
very
enjoyable
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
it
wont
get
me
to
revisit
it
soon
mk
as
a
stout
this
is
pretty
good
as
an
oatmeal
stout
i
was
disappointed
the
taste
was
of
sweet
caramel
burnt
chocolate
and
a
nice
brown
sugar
flavor
there
was
no
real
dominant
flavor
it
was
more
like
the
flavors
all
kind
of
melded
together
to
form
a
cohesive
and
enjoyable
drink
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
creamy
drinkability
was
also
good
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
no
problem
overall
a
very
solid
stout
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
d
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
not
a
ton
of
complexities
but
a
nice
full
bodied
sipper
dark
brew
with
slight
amber
color
swirls
small
foamy
tan
head
that
did
not
last
some
lacing
smells
of
brown

taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a

beer
easy
to
drink
i
had
a
large

was
disappointed
when
it
was
empty
i
would
definitely
have
another

stout
with

roasted

is
pretty
interesting
taste
of

with
some
sweetness
and
a
light
dry
bitter
finish
is
enjoyable
body
is
slightly
above
average
with
a
great
creamy
texture
well
done
overall
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
indulging
in
again
d
this
beer
has
a
thin
mellow
flavor
and
not
much
of
interest
or
complexity
pours
black
with
red
hues
and
a
thick
foamy
dark
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
malt
barley
and
sweet
notes
the
taste
is
not
as
thick
as
i
would
have
expected
but
still
a
strong
flavor
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
and
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
with
some
alcohol
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
great
balance
but
a
lighter
body
for
an
oatmeal
stout
this
is
another
good
beer
from

very

more
hearty
brew
with
stronger
more
discernible
flavors
i
suppose
i
also
can
not
help
but
compare
this
to
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
in
my
mind
the
king
of
all
stouts
youngs
is
good
yet
imo
is
seriously
lacking
in
comparison
to
many
a
stout
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
imbibe
presentation
16
9
ounce
bottle
best
before
end
date
feb
03
pours
like
motor
oil
struggling
to
get
out
of
the
bottle
black
as
night
thin
foamy
head
clinging
in
massive
patches
throughout
initial
smell
is
of
bread
and
licorice
quite
pleasant
strong
taste
of
caramel
up
front
with
a
nice
twang
of
smokiness
left
resting
on
the
palate
followed
by
somewhat
of
a
sweet
barley
sensation
my
only
comment
is
the
label
states
a
distinctive
finish
reminiscent
of
toast
just
didnt
finish
that
way
for
me
still
outstanding
a
quite
drinkable
stout
this
stout
poured
out
a
deep
brownblack
with
a
great
tan
head
i
pour
it
aggressively
to
enjoy
the
head
forming
in
the
dark
liquid
the
aroma
and
taste
both
were
good
but
not
outstanding
the
presense
of
malt
dominated
both
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
exellent
the
feel
of
the
beer
covered
the
tongue
and
was
the
fullest
of
any
beer
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
this
is
a
classic
oatmeal
stout
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
wanting
to
understand
what
an
oatmeal
stout
should
taste
like
black
in
color
with
a
faint
brownish
hue
near
the
bottom
of
the
pint
the
nitroinduced
head
is
full
very
creamy
appearance
and
tan
in
color
the
head
retention
is
excellent
with
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
provides
a
hint
of
fruitiness
and
caramel
maltiness
the
taste
is
noticeably
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
which
is
primarily
provided
by
the
nitroinduced
carbination
the
flavor
is
of
a
delicate
fruity
caramel
malt
with
some
distinctive
vanilla
overtones
a
subtle
milk
chocolate
matliness
and
an
underlying
hop
bitterness
is
also
apparent
the
finish
is
soft
with
an
underlying
bittersweet
chocolate
roastiness
even
with
the
artifically
induced
nitrocarbonation
it
may
have
smooth
soft
mouthfeel
but
appears
a
little
thin
in
texture
than
other
stouts
i
still
found
it
to
be
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
black
in
color
i
can
see
through
the
glass
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
creamy
tan
head
chocolate
and
light
burnt
coffee
aromas
dark
roasty
sweet
chocolate
flavor
nice
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
it
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
very
drinkable
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
although
it
was
smooth
and
drinkable
i
need
stout
to
have
a
bit
of
oomph
in
it
this
dry
brit
seemed
bored
and
distant
and
i
wont
be
seeing
her
again
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
however
i
think
i
was
looking
for
more
malty
and
oat
flavors
than
what
i
found
youngs
oatmeal
stout
in
the
half
liter
brown
bottle
great
looking
black
beer
tan
head
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
staying
power
very
light
chocolate
aroma
but
noticeable
taste
is
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
it
seems
easy
to
drink
whats
the
problem
then
well
its
a
good
oatmeal
stout
very
much
middle
of
the
road
but
there
is
lots
better
average
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
i
find
both
samuel
smith
and
st
ambroise
more
interesting
more
fullbodied
and
just
plain
better
tasting
best
before
0503
tasted
012603
nice
and
creamy
but
nothing
special
pours
out
black
with
a
decent
head
real
smooth
and
actually
quite
tastey
mmmmmm
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
on
the
market
magic
hat
heart
of
darkness
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
pours
a
black
ruby
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
eventually
fades
into
a
heavy
and
sticky
lace
nose
is
sweet
roasted
malts
dark
coffee
smoked
wood
and
licorice
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
tastes
of
bitter
chocolate
smoky
charcoal
burnt
coffee
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
very
little
hop
presence
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
special
oatmeal
stouts
are
just
plain
good
its
like
a
meal
and
a
drink
all
in
one
this
one
is
a
bit
thin
compared
to
rogues
shakespeare
but
is
still
quite
good
pours
out
to
an
almost
black
color
in
the
glass
with
a
very
quickly
disappearing
head
taste
is
quite
good
with
a
slight
oatmeal
sweetness
and
a
decent
roasted
malt
presence
followed
by
a
light
dose
of
hops
very
drinkable
i
found
this
stout
to
be
a
little
bland
compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
tried
recently
maybe
my
tastebuds
are
just
shot
i
really
like
it
overall
though
the
appearance
is
wonderfully
dark
and
i
could
definitely
enjoy
many
in
a
row
i
guess
i
just
compare
too
many
stouts
to
sammy
smiths
please
be
gentle
this
is
my
1st
review
i
tasted
no
sweet
oatmeal
i
too
prefer
the
double
chocolate
stout
and
am
distraught
that
i
cannot
buy
it
in
japan
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
head
is
light
brown
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
down
the
glass
there
are
roast
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
coffee
in
the
flavor
is
a
slight
creaminess
with
roast
and
coffee
flavors
the
bitterness
is
evident
but
subdued
by
the
malt
flavors
a
bit
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
is
also
present
it
is
a
smooth
brew
but
not
like
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
sampled
it
is
fullbodied
but
the
mouthfeel
still
seems
a
bit
thin
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
sample
this
one
again
this
stout
from
youngs
was
a
slight
disappointment
for
me
it
was
a
fine
brew
but
lacked
a
certain
fullness
that
one
looks
for
in
this
sort
of
beer
the
bitterness
was
ample
with
tasty
burnt
flavors
the
middle
on
the
palate
taste
seemed
weak
while
it
was
a
decent
brew
i
much
preferred
the
double
chocolate
version
this
oatmeal
stout
pours
just
about
perfectly
with
a
smooth
creamy
head
from
the
nitro
widget
it
is
a
coal
black
beer
and
topped
with
the
neautiful
atn
head
that
doen
not
subside
it
is
nearly
picture
perfect
the
aroma
seems
to
suffer
slightly
in
my
experience
with
nitro
cans
and
this
one
reveals
a
faint
malt
aroma
topped
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
chocolate
but
no
more
the
beer
tastes
terrific
with
a
smooth
chocolate
flavor
atop
a
strong
roasted
malt
base
the
hops
are
well
balanced
and
round
out
the
flavor
profile
wonderfully
this
has
a
very
clean
finish
for
a
stout
almost
too
clean
not
much
of
the
roasty
flavor
is
left
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
for
a
stout
but
lacks
the
chewiness
many
stouts
present
this
leads
to
a
very
superb
drinkability
but
not
quite
as
much
a
memorable
experience
as
many
other
stouts
a
very
good
stout
that
may
be
the
smoothest
drinking
example
on
the
planet
give
me
a
sixer
of
these
any
day
the
nose
on
youngs
oatmeal
stout
is
faint
licorice
vanilla
and
coco
tasty
roasted
malt
and
sweet
oatmeal
the
flavors
were
lovely
with
roasted
malts
meshing
with
sweet
oatmeal
licorice
vanilla
and
very
faint
charred
wood
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
filling
yet
soft
finishes
somewhat
dry
the
tan
head
was
lacking
the
dark
brown
body
was
ideal
its
drinkable
to
a
fault
tasty
this
is
an
outstanding
stout
its
a
real
winner
peace
love
and
beer
pours
a
uniformly
dark
tone
with
dark
currant
hints
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
fine
bronze
head
disapears
rather
quickly
with
minimal
lace
first
smell
reminded
me
of
merlot
with
its
rich
fruitiness
as
the
beer
warmed
tones
of
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
were
more
prominent
taste
is
smooth
and
surprisingly
crispa
traditional
stout
profile
with
less
of
the
creamy
fullness
one
often
gets
that
quality
lends
this
beer
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
pale
brown
head
pretty
sweet
aromas
of
oatmeal
cookies
peanut
butter
cookies
macaroons
cigar
smoke
and
biscuits
not
so
much
creamy
as
it
is
silky
and
pliant
nicely
articulated
coffee
extract
and
mediterranean
spices
on
the
finish
a
great
foodsession
beer
roasted
oats
cocoa
sweet
malts
fuggles
and
goldings
hops
make
for
an
intriguing
elliptical
balancing
certainly
the
malts
are
more
assertive
as
would
be
expected
but
this
beer
would
be
simple
without
the
select
hops
to
create
subtle
complexities
soft
burt
persimmon
dryness
in
the
finish
incredibly
smooth
and
palatable
an
intersting
mix
of
nutty
and
fruity
aromas
a
fantastic
stout
for
future
reference
please
dont
sample
this
cold
a
deep
dark
pour
almost
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
in
the
beginning
that
fades
slowly
a
little
lace
but
not
much
the
smell
of
chocolate
is
predominate
over
roasted
malt
coffee
maybe
a
little
toffee
or
caramel
a
little
more
bite
than
the
double
chocolate
creamy
but
with
a
lightly
noticeable
hop
finish
ive
been
on
a
stout
kick
lately
and
this
is
a
good
one
ill
admit
that
i
am
a
young
beer
advocate
and
have
not
yet
much
explored
the
world
of
stouts
but
this
seems
to
be
a
great
start
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
very
first
sip
wonderful
color
its
very
dark
and
full
bodied
its
smooth
and
hearty
of
course
i
have
no
prior
frame
of
reference
but
this
seems
to
be
an
excellant
oatmeal
stout
i
might
even
have
to
replace
my
usual
bowl
of
oatmeal
for
breakfast
with
this
just
kidding
extremely
dark
no
light
come
through
it
at
all
dense
tan
head
and
generous
lace
rings
roasted
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
chocalate
caramel
and
vanilla
wow
very
smooth
and
creamy
rich
malt
taste
along
and
finishes
with
a
coffee
flavor
excellent
mouthfeel
and
not
too
heavy
more
drinkable
then
some
other
stouts
a
solid
brew
this
poured
a
lovely
dark
dark
brown
and
held
the
head
for
a
nice
long
time
not
that
long
drank
it
rather
quickly
its
beyond
me
how
this
can
be
such
a
sweet
taste
yet
have
that
hops
bitterness
that
i
adore
each
sip
brought
out
a
different
nuance
caramel
coffee
just
pure
yummy
who
wants
a
nasty
dry
stout
when
you
have
deleicious
and
nutritious
oatmeal
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
cheers
superb
i
can
consume
my
weight
in
this
stuff
just
dont
ask
me
any
questions
that
require
logic
after
i
do
it
this
brew
pours
a
dark
coffee
color
with
a
full
3
finger
head
that
hangs
in
there
quite
nicely
the
smell
is
that
of
a
hoppy
beer
althought
the
hops
are
balanced
superbly
in
the
taste
possibly
hints
of
slight
coffee
tones
and
creamy
throughout
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
did
i
mention
that
this
is
good
stuff
cheers
dudes
notes
a
top
notch
oatmeal
stout
not
so
heavy
to
take
away
from
the
drinkability
and
does
not
lack
in
flavour
or
complexity
one
of
my
favourite
beers
from
youngs
and
one
i
frequent
when
i
am
looking
for
a
full
flavoured
stout
a
very
satisfying
and
robust
stout
the
aroma
is
the
forst
thing
that
grabs
me
a
very
roastymalty
kind
of
thing
thsi
si
a
good
knifeandfork
beer
the
beer
that
drinks
like
a
meal
one
of
the
best
british
stouts
i
have
tried
pours
very
dark
brownblack
with
thick
tan
head
rich
dark
malt
give
a
pleasant
roasted
smokey
aroma
taste
is
full
and
rich
with
a
slightly
toasted
taste
almost
burnt
but
not
in
a
negative
way
nicely
bitter
with
a
full
alcohol
flavor
finishes
slightly
dry
and
mouth
biting
solidly
good
beer
but
not
exceptional
pours
nearly
black
with
a
medium
tancolored
head
head
quickly
fades

roasted

stand
out

okay
the
color
is
very
dark
with
a
slight
maroon
hue
the
head
is
a
medium
tan
color
the
body
is
lighter
than
i
prefer
on
this
style
i
like
the
taste
but
still
doesnt
beat
samuel
smith
or
more
my
local
favorite
barleys
worth
checking
out
though
deep
rubybrown
color
with
a
faint
malt
nose
and
dry
malt
flavor
just
a
touch
of
smoke
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
an
incredible
pour
lots
of
head
due
to
the
nitro
device
in
the
can
the
head
is
a
thick
and
creamy
off
white
that
threatened
to
escape
a
long
pint
glass
when
poured
with
perhaps
half
a
centimeter
remaining
after
a
few
minutes
and
lots
of
thick
lace
the
color
is
a
brown
so
deep
that
it
appears
to
be
black
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
rather
sweet
the
oatmeal
very
prominent
fruit
and
roasted
barley
less
so
very
smooth
taste
with
lots
of
roasted
barley
initially
and
then
the
oats
slight
hoppiness
and
a
mild
bitterness
from
the
barley
at
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
mouth
feel
as
creamy
and
smooth
as
milk
a
fine
beer
black
in
color
thick
and
creamy
head
mild
roasted
grain
aroma
medium
sweet
and
medium
dry
with
the
complexity
of
dark
roasted
grains
medium
hop
bitterness
very
well
balanced
with
the
malt
a
hint
of
nuttiness
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
nitro
widget
a
little
thin
and
lackluster
flavor
but
still
a
good
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
ones
that
i
had
not
the
best
stout
but
its
got
some
characeter
but
a
bit
creamy
on
tap
which
is
the
only
way
ive
sample
this
beer
still
nice
but
not
the
best
nice
roastiness
decent
after
about
a
year
of
drinking
real
beers
now
and
reading
the
reviews
here
this
is
my
first
review
please
be
patient
i
love
the
appearence
of
this
beer
the
deep
dark
color
and
the
nice
tan
foamy
head
make
for
an
inviting
glass
the
smell
wasnt
that
impressive
but
then
again
not
offensive
i
really
like
the
taste
very
rich
and
smooth
just
like
the
can
says
but
i
expected
a
little
more
oatmeal
taste
and
sweetness
which
is
why
i
gave
it
only
a
4
0
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
and
very
drinkable
beer
very
rich
nice
lace
falling
down
the
side
of
the
glass
after
12
hours
of
work
today
i
was
thinking
about
this
beer
for
at
least
8
hours
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
however
i
think
the
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
has
a
better
oatmeal
malt
flavor
the
only
thing
lacking
is
the
slightly
thinner
feeling
and
taste
than
the
samuel
smith
version
which
is
the
only
other
one
i
can
compare
it
to
i
will
drink
it
again
a
nice
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
doesnt
stay
that
long
roasted
barley
and
oatmeal
in
the
nose
smooth
oatmeal
with
a
little
less
roasted
barley
on
the
tongue
a
nicely
balanced
beer
not
really
any
perceptable
bitterness
but
enough
so
that
you
arent
complaining
of
too
much
sweetness
smooth
and
creamy
in
your
mouth
and
somewhat
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
it
isnt
exactly
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
like
to
grab
a
bottle
or
draught
can
every
now
and
then
thick
initial
head
dissapates
into
a
thin
but
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
belgian
lace
until
the
last
sip
almost
black
in
color
with
just
a
tinge
of
brown
when
held
to
light
slight
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
barley
aroma
is
discernible
but
that
awesome
youngs
fruity
estery
nose
from
the
yeast
strain
actually
dominates
roasted
barley
character
dominates
initially
then
is
followed
by
a
silky
smoothness
from
oats
could
use
a
touch
more
malt
complexity
and
body
hop
bitterness
is
only
a
foundation
and
is
not
in
the
forefront
the
brew
finishes
with
roasted
barley
bitterness
on
the
tongue
like
many
stouts
do
as
with
most
of
youngs
brews
the
drinkablility
is
unsurpassed
although
this
is
certainly
an
above
average
oatmeal
stout
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
fine
brewery
its
a
notch
or
two
below
fresh

still
better
than
the
majority
of
american
microbrewed
oatmeal
stouts
however
review
from
a

oz

can
agree
that
the
aroma
is
even
influenced
by
oatmeal
very
creamy
cascades
downward
in
the
pint
glass
for
a
long
time
very
pleasant
body
and
mouthfeel
and
a
nottoosweet
but
discernably
chocomalt
mid
taste
flavor
enjoyed
overall
pretty
good
stuff
had
this
at
nice
hangout
called
the
black
sheep
here
in
philly
i
understand
that
in
london
youre
either
a
fullers
guy
or
a
youngs
guy
i
guess
im
a
fullers
guy
this
is
not
a
bad
stout
but
it
just
seems
rather
thin
it
pours
a
nice
tan
head
it
has
a
great
dark
almost
black
color
but
the
smell
and
flavor
are
a
bit
light
if
im
going
to
drink
a
youngs
stout
ill
have
their
double
chocolate
stout
smooth
as
silk
superb
oatmeal
stout
full
bodied
but
does
not
weigh
you
down
like
a
ton
of
bricks
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
well
balanced
i
usually
think
of
an
oatmeal
stout
as
a
beer
for
winter
but
this
is
a
good
yearround
brew
the
best
bottled
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
only
beer
better
is
youngs
bitter
cask
conditioned
in
a
london
pub
if
you
love
a
stout
that
is
smooth
and
utterly
drinkable
than
try
this
exceptional
beer
highest
rating
the
beer
offers
light
amounts
of
roasted
coffee
a
medium
minus
roast
character
with
some
bitterness
of
anies
on
the
back
the
beer
has
a
medium
minus
mouthfeel
and
that
follows
on
the
amount
of
flavor
as
well
high
b
3

the
flavor
also
has
a
nice
balance
with
a
modest
but
obvious
coffee
addition
that
mixes
with
the
malts
rather
than
masking
them

there
to

coming
when
craving
a

pallet
love
especially
good
beer
for
the
coffee
lover
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
beer
but
the
coffee
taste
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
its
actually
a
pretty
good
brew
this
is
a
really
good
beer
certainly
a
very
good
beer
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
coffee
stouts
on
the
market
right
now
the
coffee
flavors
are
there
but
are
weak
theres
a
touch
of
chocolate
as
well
thats
about
it
it
feels
a
little
thin
as
well
just
not
hitting
the
right
notes

me

stout
however
it
was
too
bitter
considering
the
coffee
flavor
and

was
missing
or
just
overpowered
by
the
hops
i
would
never

its

i
get
the
taste
of
french

this
is
a
good

the

gets
a

for

at

ok
i
hate
coffee
but
this
has
a
very
subtle
coffee
taste
more
coffee
aroma
but
doesnt
dominate
the
beer
mouth
feel
was
ok
for
a
stout
i
wasnt
happy
how
carbonated
this
beer
is
jeez
very
bubbly
has
a
semi
creamy
feel
to
it
a
solid
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
either
i
would
drink
again
tho
enjoyable
mouthfeel
medium

with
a
lingering

perfect
for
breakfast
also
for
dessert
dip
some
vanilla
ice
cream
in
this
one
all
in
all
id
come
back
to
either
but
under
druthers
id
go
cask
btw
this
is
not
always
the
case
in
my
book
usually
flavors
survive
better
from
casks
but
often
since
they
are
higher
maintenance
they
can
lose
in
the
long
run
in
this
instance
it
is
not
the
case
a
real
treat
had
a
bottle
on
a
hot
day
while
home
brewing
a
lot
of
coffee
notes
in
this
one
decent
drink
ability
for
its
bulk
met
my
expectations
wasnt
earth
shattering
strong
tasty
stout
didnt
realize
it
was
7
5
until
i
had
3
of
them
i
would
have
it
again
o
pretty
pleasant
beer
although
i
would
probably
only
have
one
in
a
session
maybe
slightly
above
middle
of
the
road
for
this
beer
in
its
category
having
a
beer
for
breakfast
this
is
the
one
if
you
like
coffee
and
a
kick
ass
beer
this
will
suit
you
just
fine
medium
head
when
poured
and
dissipates
rather
fast
flavor
is
bold
and
finishes
with
just
the
right
amount
of
somewhat
bitter
coffee
flavor
taste
remains
in
mouth
for
quite
awhile
but
so
does
coffee
high
alcohol
content
but
well
balanced
black
in
color
poured
with
a
thick
light
beige
foam
that
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
dark
roasted
and
charred
malt
aromas
with
earthy
cereal
grain
and
dark
chocolate
notes
medium
bodied
and
creamy
smooth
with
light
soft
carbonation
through
the
middle
the
body
thinned
toward
the
finish
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
immediately
followed
by
bitter
burnt
malt
and
roasted
coffee
beans
hop
bitterness
kicked
in
from
the
middle
to
the
end
riding
over
dark
roasted
malt
finished
with
a
lingering
bitter
charred
malt
aftertaste
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
most
of
the
head
dissipated
but
a
thin
film
remained
for
quite
some
time
the
nose
has
roasted
notes
but
i
am
really
not
getting
any
coffee
notes
the
flavor
is
similar
roast
but
the
coffee
is
very
very
faint
the
body
is
fairly
hearty
and
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
overall
although
enjoyable
i
dont
think
its
a
good
representation
of
a
coffee
stout
not
enough
coffee
or
roasted
malt
flavor
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
as
well
and
the
aftertaste
isnt
that
great
as
its
bitter
for
the
style
with
better
options
available
i
probably
wont
be
returning
to
this
any
time
soon
o
decent
coffee
stout
i
could
drink
more
but
i
have
several
others
that
i
like
better
this
is
okay
across
the
board
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
area
overall
a
good
beer
but
with
a
name
like
java
head
youd
expect
a
coffee
bomb
this
is
not
instead
its
a
fairly
hoppy
stout
with
coffee
character
taking
a
lesser
supporting
role
eh
its
good
enough
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
i
am
drinking
this
beer
right
now
as
i
write
this
i
am
still
enjoying
the
various
flavors
even
though
i
am
not
a
fan
of
black
coffee
that
says
a
lot
for
how
tasty
this
beer
is
overall
this
has
been
my
goto
favorite
from
troegs
last
i
was
at
their
brewpub
this
is
what
i
had
as
well
being
a
coffee
type
stout
which
i
love
good
stuff
overall
this
really
beats
you
over
the
head
with
the
burnt
malts
nothing
in
balance
this
is
a
well
crafted
coffee
brew
that
isnt
too
much
coffee
and
not
enough
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
coffee
hops
and
malt
very
good
the
aftertaste
is
more
than
just
a
coffee
overdose
like
some
of
these
is
very
pleasant
recommended
surprised
to
see
this
beer
only
rated
around
the
80s
overall
its
a
great
beer
for
any
stout
andor
coffee
lovers
what
really
caught
me
off
guard
is
finding
a
realization
that
this
beer
is
in
fact
a
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
is
great
and
taste
up
to
its
expectations
great
taste
and
balance
of
mostly
semisweet
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
nice
vibe
with
its
bold
7
5
abv
mixture
of
sweet
and
bitterness
with
a
spiky
but
smooth
mouthfeel
i
recently
got
a
six
pack
from
my
local
beverage
store
and
it
did
not
disappoint
especially
the
fact
of
its
moderate
cost
definitely
worth
every
penny
will
be
buying
again
soon
good
coffee
presence
with
a
stout
and
creamy
body
the
raisinplum
plays
well
and
adds
a
creative
layer
nice
creamy
texture
this
went
down
very
smooth
the
color
of
this
beer
is
as
the
name
implies
as
coffee
it
has
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
is
subtle
and
ashy
the
taste
is
strongly
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
lingers
long
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
oily
as
it
is
not
overly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
just
shy
of
outstanding
o
an
excellent
coffee
stout
im
getting
to
like
these
a
lot
because
they
are
very
tasty
and
the
caffeine
tends
to
counteract
the
alcohol
to
the
point
your
body
seems
to
think
it
has
just
ingested
a
very
low
abv
brew
so
work
such
as
writing
beer
reviews
can
proceed
pretty
much
uninterrupted
by
a
serious
beer
high
good
when
you
want
to
drink
beer
with
some
substance
but
not
get
taken
out
by
it
o
java
head
definitely
hits
a
bullseye
with
the
java
claim
lots
of
sweetened
coffee
flavors
here
to
satisfy
any
starbucks
fan
or
anyone
who
prefers
their
stouts
on
the
slightly
sweeter
side
in
terms
of
stouts
in
general
im
not
floored
by
this
but
its
definitely
a
tasty
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
again
in
the
future
if
youre
a
fan
of
iced
coffee
or
coffee
in
general
give
this
one
a
chance
i
just
visited
the
brewery
thats
next
to
hershey
and
im
surprised
they
didnt
use
their
chocolate
in
this
beer
it
tastes
like
it
the
coffee
beans
add
to
the
roastyness
and
wow
this
is
just
an
incredible
beer
one
of
my
favorites
that
troegs
makes
hands
down
they
ran
out
of
it
on
tap
at
troegs
and
i
understand
why
now
overall
not
bad
typical
straight
forward
stout
nothing
bad
nothing
great
very
drinkable
overall
very
watery
more
of
a
porter
in
many
ways
assertive
coffee
hoppy
stout
actually
a
foreign
coffee
stout
but
with
a
lower
drinkability

on
the

with
the
roast

is
medium
heavy

pretty
rich
for

beer
overall
and
something
i
could
see
being
a
nice
goto
for
a
rich
beer
on
a
week
night
o
i
love
the
coffee
back

but
cant
get
over
the

a

this

has
a

overall
this
is
an
above

beer
with
a
subdued

that
is
somewhat
acrid
in
my
opinion
o
a
decent
coffee
stout
good
hop
earthiness
not
overwhelming
coffee

pleasantly
surprised
at
its
approachability

still
too
cloying
for

in

row
very
above
average
many
coffee
stouts
go
too
far
with
harsh
flavors
but
this
one
hits
a
lot
of
the
right
notes
i
dont
consider
myself
a
connoisseur
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
i
know
why
i
like
it
im
a

lover
and
troegs

is
up
there
with
the
best
it
poured
a
dark

with
a
thick

the
hint
of
coffee
was
well

not

and
to
my
satisfaction
the
lacing
lasted
to
the
final

i
love
stouts

coffee
just
wasnt
a
memorable

java

good
coffee

with

good

decent
body
but
overall
a
bit
light
overall
its
a
stout
with
some
nice
coffee
flavors
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
im
also
new
with
the
stout
style
as
well
as
stated
the
complexity
of
this
brew
is
a
big
reason
to
go
and
try
if
if
you
have
not
already
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
troegs
craft
brews
do
not
dissappoint
give
it
a
try
o
this
is
not
fbs
not
for
a
second
one
is
decadent
sweet
yet
brimming
with
coffee
while
the
other
this
is
hoppy
bitter
yet
very
easy
to
drink
as
someone
who
doesnt
mind
a
bitterass
stout
this
one
is
quite
satisfying
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
an
interesting
stout
and
i
would
buy
a
case
it
is
different
from
other
stouts
with
the
dominance
of
the
hops
but
i
find
a
lot
of
similarities
with
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
overall
easy
drinking
beer
lots
of
coffee
flavor
not
over

the

i
had
to
agitate
the

to
produce
a
fuller

the
taste
gives
you
some
iight
espresso
but
the
body
is
fairly
thin
this
drinks
much
more
like
a
coffee
ale
bordering
on
a
porter
solid
flavor
but
not
exactly
what
the

describes
java
head
hits
the
ground
running
with
a

its
rich

bright
and
gives
a
level
of
spunk
to
beer
drinking
overall
a
very
enjoyable
coffee
stout
that
id
drink
regularly
o
kind
of
surprised
after
trying
this
i
think
it
should
be
rated
higher
than
it
is
it
is
true
that
the
coffee
flavors
could
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
its
a
real
nice
combination
of
roasty
and
sweet
drinks
smooth
and
warms
you
nicely
thumbs
up
overall
i
heartily
recommend
im
going
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
if
the
hops
are
noticeable
definitely
a
good
one
from
troegs
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
coffee
chocolate
and
oats
straightforward
and
well
executed
overall
a
beer
i
have
had
many
times
via
the
bottle
first
time
from
the
tap
to
be
honest
didnt
feel
much
of
a
difference
betweeen
the
two
a
great
coffee
stout
certainly
one
i
would
recommend
and
have
again
readily
available
in
this
part
of
pa
an
old
favorite
from
beginning
craft
days
havent
had
one
in
so
long
i
had
forgotten
how
good
this
is
looks
like
a
stout
theyre
all
good
darkest
brown
to
black
good
head
beautiful
lace
nice
aroma
of
mild
roast
coffee
mild
bitter
big
coffee
taste
with
a
nice
grapefruit
bitter
orange
hoppy
blast
mouthfeel
oily
and
slick
finishes
dry
with
that
great
bitter
hop
aftertaste
i
had
that
stone
dayman
coffee
ipa
this
year
guess
what
this
has
been
around
and
is
just
as
good
o
excellent
coffee
stout
from
troegs
this
is
a
bigger
take
on
the
style
but
the
balance
of
hops
is
what
i
like
best
here
though
this
isnt
for
the
feint
beer
drinker
its
bold
o
this
is
pretty
good
im
not
too
keen
on
coffee
stouts
because
i
feel
like
there
is
a
way
to
achieve
a
coffee
character
without
actually
using
coffee
however
the
coffee
is
a
good
complement
and
does
not
overpower
the
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
mocha
colored
head
of
foam
that
fell
slowly
to
coat
the
glass
with
thick
lace
nose
is
simple
uncluttered
and
mild
bittersweet
chocolate
with
the
coffee
behind
that
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
the
hops
are
subtle
but
they
bring
a
touch
of
earth
and
floral
and
make
the
nose
bright
i
smell
a
little
lemon
but
no
oats
the
taste
is
burnt
chocolate
the
coffee
steps
up
and
emboldens
the
flavor
of
the
malt
body
is
thinner
than
it
looks
the
palate
is
beautiful
simplicity
like
the
nose
and
as
it
warms
everything
gains
in
flavor
but
not
in
intensity
extremely
well
done
the
drink
is
creamy
and
rich
finishes
dry
a
little
oily
with
some
bitter
and
smoke
and
more
coffee
this
was
my
first
stout
and
troegs
has
won
me
over
completely
this
was
a
stately
pleasing
stout
undeniably
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
if
you
love
your
beer
leave
it
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
get
out
there
and
play
the
field
its
a
mighty
big
field
and
free
love
is
what
craft
beer
is
all
about
this
beer
has
no
real
flavor
if
you
dont
practically
gargle
with
it
and
then
all
it
does
is
burn
the
skin
off
of
your
uvula
then
after
you
swallow
the
party
is
basically
over
unless
you
are
in
to
a
burning
uvula
and
you
go
back
for
more
it
has
some
strong
bitterness
then
just
a
really
acidic
end
with
no
after
taste
o
very
good
the
actual
coffee
taste
was
well
balanced
not
overly
bitter
funny
thing
is
that
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
because
i
dont
like
hot
drinks
but
coffee
stouts
are
among
my
favorite
styles
o
solid
but
unspectacular
tastes
wonderful
until
the
bitter
chocolate
aftertaste
overpowers
the
initial
flavors
a
bit
disappointing
as
i
prefer
stouts
and
porters
this
is
very
dry
and
bitter
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
fell
short
of
my
expectations
taste
has
quite
a
roasted
malt
character
to
it
a
bit
burnt
perhaps
with
a
small
bitterness
on
the
finish
coffee
is
very
light
most
coffee
stouts
that
ive
had
pack
way
more
of
a
coffee
punch
than
this
as
it
is
it
comes
across
more
like
an
ordinary
stout
to
me
those
arent
really
my
favorite
style
so
thats
a
letdown
to
me
o
not
sure
i
would
classify
this
as
an
oatmeal
stout
as
it
is
missing
some
of
the
sweetness
and
all
of
the
smoothness
expected
from
the
style
i
guess
the
whole
flower
hops
really
alter
the
typical
taste
profile
the
burnt
bitterness
and
the
hoppy
bitterness
do
not
work
for
me
my
brother
has
been
raving
about
this
one
for
some
time
and
i
am
very
surprised
about
how
good
this
stout
is
i
guess
i
should
listen
to
my
brother
more
at
least
about
beer
another
great
beer
from
troegs
no
much
nose
to
this
but
otherwise
a
solid
coffee
stout
not
very
good
balance
in
this
beer
i
dont
understand
the
fruitiness
whether
from
yeast
esters
or
aggressive
american
hops
it
just
doesnt
belong
in
my
coffee
oatmeal
stout
too
much
carbonation
as
well
makes
the
aftertaste
unpleasant
and
punishes
each
sip
instead
of
inviting
another
this
beer
grows
on
you
well
balanced
stout
equally
displays
hops
with
coffee
good
complexity
could
use
less
roasted
malt
and
more
crystal
malt
sweetness
overall
very
pleasant
and
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
o
a
great
oatmeal
stout
with
a
very
coffeeforward
approach
id
say
this
one
stands
up
there
with
the
better
coffee
oatmeal
stouts
such
as
fbs
or
wnb
definitely
an
underdog
in
the
category
most
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
it
isnt
labeled
as
an
imperial
overall
pretty
standard
oatmeal
stout
the
oats
seemed
to
have
gotten
lost
in
the
roasted
notes
still
a
good
beer
though
the
flavor
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
especially
the
coffee
its
a
tasty
stout
with
a
lot
of
flavor
having
had
java
head
several
times
now
ive
found
it
to
be
a
very
wellbalanced
coffee
stout
more
coffee
and
more
viscosity
would
be
nice
but
as
it
stands
its
a
great
stout
that
i
keep
coming
back
to
o
a
good
coffee
stout
good
hop
balance
i
expected
to
get
smacked
with
burnt
coffee
malt
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
its
drinkability
overall
where
is
the
coffee
here
basically
a
decent
base
beer
but
definitely
is
lacking
a
memorable
quality
d
nicely
done
but
i
dont
get
a
great
deal
of
coffee
in
either
the
flavor
or
aroma
there
is
significant
chocolate
in
the
flavor
profile
but
it
is
more
or
less
a
slightly
sweeter
than
average
american
stout
mo
full
bodied
intense
and
somewhat
dry
this
is
a
great
brew
all
around
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
worth
trying
serving
temp
and
glassware
are
key
i
love
the
brash
hoppiness
versus
the
sweeter
coffee
notes
an
experiment
gone
right
excellently
different
unique
and
easy
to
revisit
cheers
o
i
enjoyed
this
with
a
meltinyourmouth
panseared
coffee
rubbed
ny
sirloin
with
a
demi
glace
made
from
the
beer
the
pairing
was
heavenly
having
a
flashback
good
one
right
now
will
have
to
try
this
again
all
by
itself
pours
black
with
little
or
no
light
of
white
colored
head
a
finge
or
two
at
pour
and
disappates
nicely
to
a
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
lots
of
spotted
lacing
smells
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
taste
brings
the
same
but
adds
some
chocolate
notes
overall
good
taste
but
also
pulling
in
some
vibrancy
from
maybe
fruits
hops
o
a
very
tasty
coffee
stout
with
a
surprising
citrus
element
that
blends
perfectly
with
the
coffee
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
making
this
a
very
drinkable
ale
pours
black
with
a
light
brown
head
that
recedes
to
the
edges
aroma
seems
rather
underwhelming
to
for
what
i
was
expecting
i
am
not
really
getting
much
coffee
seems
like
i
am
getting
some
hops
though
offering
a
line
pine
some
licorice
on
top
of
a
roasted
malt
base
flavor
is
as
underwhelming
as
the
aroma
and
slightly
off
putting
really
crappy
coffee
licorice
some
sugars
from
the
oats
roasted
malts
and
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
fuller
bodied
and
creamy
overall
what
a
disapointment
perhaps
however
this
was
my
fault
for
drinking
a
breakfast
stout
right
before
this
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
i
will
have
to
give
this
another
and
maybe
more
fair
chance
overall
another
enjoyable
brew
by
troegs
could
have
a
little
more
body
and
maltiness
but
still
pulls
through
as
a
great
stout
o
a
solid
stout
tasty
in
its
own
right
although
i
would
have
perfected
a
bit
more
coffe
and
a
bit
more
heft
perhaps
an
impy
version
of
this
brew
with
some
dialed
up
coffee
and
this
would
be
seriously
awesome
solid
just
the
same
though
pouring
aggressively
into
a
snifter
yields
a
powerful
1
5
inch
tan
head
that
stays
put
for
a
good
34
minutes
jet
black
in
color
and
smells
of
coffee
roasted
everything
etc
nice
but
nothing
too
crazy
first
taste
is
burnt
coffee
and
very
bitter
at
that
very
subtle
coco
and
malty
goodness
on
the
back
end
but
again
nothing
too
complex
this
beer
isnt
nearly
as
sweet
as
id
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
really
its
a
midrange
stout
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
java
head
is
slightly
above
average
but
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
rest
of
troegs
great
brews
having
said
all
this
i
am
glad
it
is
part
of
their
winter
variety
pack
as
its
a
good
pick
for
the
colder
months
o
a
mediocre
attempt
at
a
java
stout
from
a
prestigious
brewery
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
its
not
extreme
and
its
not
overthetop
it
almost
drinks
like
a
porter
not
bad
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
i
should
mention
however
that
i
just
love
the
label
on
this
bottle
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
not
very
satisfying
for
a
stout
i
like
the
acidity
but
its
almost
gritty
and
not
balanced
by
anything
else
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
basic
taste
doesnt
really
develop
other
than
the
chocolate
and
it
gets
a
bit
boring
to
drink
to
be
perfectly
honest
not
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
ive
had
this
is
a
nice
simple
easy
to
drink
beer
it
has
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
but
its
simple
enough
that
you
can
have
a
couple
of
them
without
worry
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
not
my
favorite
a
good
beer
i
love
coffee
stouts
and
this
one
is
unique
to
others
o
not
great
but
a
decent
stout
i
would
buy
again
if
given
a
chance
oa
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
a
little
overpowered
by
the
malt
not
enough
coffee
overall
id
like
to
have
a
little
more
coffee
flavor
in
something
called
java
head
no
comparison
to
some
other
coffee
stouts
bells
java
stout
still
rules
the
category
in
my
book
not
much
complexity
here
but
not
bad
either
a
lot
of
bitter
and
dryness
let
it
warm
and
breathe
and
then
sip
it
o
the
coffee
flavor
in
this
beer
is
really
nice
but
unfortunately
there
is
not
enough
other
notes
or
complexity
in
this
beer
it
is
quite
bitter
and
the
dry
mouthfeel
makes
this
not
the
easiest
drinker
this
is
a
slow
sipping
beer
o
pretty
good
the
coffee
or
the
chocolate
flavor
has
some
room
for
improvement
need
a
little
more
boldness
good
winter
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
feel
like
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muddled
due
to
the
vegetal
hops
but
theres
a
wonderful
texture
here
and
a
good
flavor
to
boot
this
one
i
purchased
at
the
brewery
it
pours
a
nice
dark
as
night
body
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
hold
for
a
long
time
the
smell
has
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
and
some
hop
aroma
the
taste
has
a
decent
coffee
flavor
up
front
but
not
too
strong
then
i
detect
a
hop
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
very
smooth
and
leaves
just
a
little
bitter
after
taste
in
your
mouth
overall
thsi
is
a
good
stout
even
though
the
coffee
flavors
are
over
taken
by
the
malt
and
hop
o
an
impressive
coffee
stout
its
quite
unique
in
the
way
that
the
citrus
flavors
break
up
the
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
as
it
crosses
the
palate
well
worth
trying
definitely
a
beer
ill
buy
again
and
one
id
recommend
ive
let
the
beer
warm
considerably
so
the
nose
ranges
from
sweet
sticky
toffee
to
bitter
roasted
coffee
the
taste
is
just
as
potent
with
upfront
grain
sweetness
teeming
with
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
followed
by
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
velvet
but
i
would
have
liked
more
of
the
grain
to
linger
the
carbonation
and
full
body
made
this
a
perfect
dessert
beer
definitely
up
there
with
fbs
and
wnb
but
not
quite
there
yet
in
a
word
meh
nothing
great
not
horrible
but
the
six
pack
i
bought
was
definitely
more
of
than
i
want
to
drink
you
can
actually
taste
the
grittiness
of
the
coffee
beans
but
no
actual
coffee
theres
some
chocolate
overtones
but
in
a
powered
box
kind
of
way
it
leaves
a
hell
of
an
after
taste
and
again
not
in
a
good
way
the
more
i
write
the
more
i
dont
like
the
beer
i
would
drink
again
merely
to
confirm
the
absence
of
the
coffee
i
had
man
this
year
is
taking
longer
than
ever
to
get
the
reviews
in
from
march
madness
thanks
to
koufax21
for
bringing
this
one
the
taste
is
pretty
straight
forward
fresh
american
stout
base
with
the
addition
of
a
coldpressed
black
coffee
nice
and
creamy
this
would
likely
be
a
routine
purchase
if
i
had
this
one
in
distribution
like
most
of
troegs
brews
the
java
head
stout
get
high
marks
in
my
book
it
had
a
nice
dark
consistent
color
slightly
reminding
me
of
a
manhattan
special
with
a
kick
it
went
down
smooth
and
easy
i
could
almost
taste
the
hops
and
coffee
beans
mixing
together
in
my
mouth
for
a
very
complex
but
soothing
taste
it
is
a
little
heavier
than
a
guinness
and
probably
best
paired
with
a
good
meal
a
very
dark
stout
when
poured
thick
head
which
lasted
only
briefly
didnt
have
the
powerful
coffee
smell
of
a
fresh
coffee
stout
was
more
malty
with
the
coffee
playing
more
a
background
role
the
taste
was
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
then
the
coffee
and
hops
seem
to
tease
the
taste
buds
into
guessing
which
is
causing
the
bitterness
not
as
thick
and
creamy
of
some
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
well
crafted
and
worthy
of

it

and

o
overall
a
decent
coffee
stout
to
me
its
easily
drinkable
and
one
of
my
goto
coffee
flavored
stouts
overall
it
was
an
alright
drinking
experience
although
i
do
remember
it
being
better
when
had
from
a
bottle
noncask
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
didnt
know
it
was
an
oatmeal
stout
or
i
would
have
tryed
it
sooner
love
it
great
black
color
and
some
bitter
hops
that
works
in
this
beer
and
coffe
i
taste
coffe
some
body
some
they
dont
taste
coffee
my
son
says
he
can
smell
it
from
across
the
the
room
great
beer
gonna
drink
this
all
the
time
when
i
cant
find
anything
else
hmmm
good
overall
i
probably
wont
be
getting
this
again
the
taste
is
decent
though
super
dry
and
the
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
do
much
in
the
way
of
adding
dimension
to
the
beer
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
i
find
my
glass
with
much
less
in
it
than
expected
every
time
i
look
at
it
overall
a
phenomenal
new
experience
as
the
ice
cream
melts
it
blends
even
more
with
the
beer
its
unreal
i
really
hope
they
do
a
big
chocolate
stout
the
float
of
that
would
be
amazing
overall
a
decent
brew
not
outstanding
by
any
means
but
pleasant
and
tasty
overall
solid
dry
stout
rather
tasty
coffee
isnt
very
strongly
present
though
o
another
solid
beer
from
troegs
overall
this
is
just
an
average
stout
nothing
really
makes
it
stand
out
drink
overall
i
enjoyed
its
a
risk
to
do
a
coffee
beer
and
it
could
be
my
fault
i
waited
to
long
to
drink
it
id
do
the
same
pairing
again
o
it
is
a
good
coffee
stout
with
a
great
aroma
and
taste
the
flavors
favor
bitter
more
than
sweet
but
there
arent
any
flavors
that
dont
belong
i
enjoy
most
of
troegs
beers
and
this
beer
is
good
but
not
outstanding
there
are
some
better
options
but
this
one
is
good
cheap
and
available
not
super
complex
but
whats
here
is
good
predominantly
deep
dark
java
the
oatmeal
contributes
a
thick
creamy
body
a
solid
beer
with
wide
availability
but
it
cant
touch
breakfast
stout
overall
this
is
a
flat
out
good
well
balanced
malt
forward
beer
the
coffee
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
most
stouts
nor
is
there
any
discernable
chocolate
taste
however
the
balance
in
this
brew
makes
up
for
any
shortcomings
a
completely
opaque
extremely
dark
brown
color
topped
with
a
light
tancream
colored
head
great
lacing
on
the
glass
but
the
head
goes
down
rather
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
with
the
presence
of
grains
and
the
coffee
bean
taste
has
a
roasted
grain
flavor
with
coffee
is
in
the
forefront
there
are
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
chocolate
as
well
the
finish
leaves
you
with
a
certain
earthiness
the
coffee
aspect
is
not
as
nice
as
fbs
but
i
still
am
pleased
i
wish
this
was
thickerfuller
bodied
but
it
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easily
i
wish
this
beer
was
a
bit
thicker
and
the
coffee
flavors
were
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
fresh
that
being
said
this
was
still
a
fine
coffee
oatmeal
stout
and
paired
well
with
my
breakfast
oa
decent
beer
however
as
it
warmed
more
of
its
flaws
came
out
o
a
tasty
beer
i
would
definitely
try
again
i
feel
like
its
hard
to
make
a
bad
coffee
stout
i
think
the
carbonation
could
be
stepped
back
a
bit
though
received
in
trade
from
hudak
thanks
man
poured
from
bottle
dated
10262011
to
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
deep
brown
edges
when
held
to
light
a
nice
1
5
finger
thick
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
throughout
the
nose
consists
of
a
pleasant
blend
of
espresso
and
coffee
tones
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
begins
with
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
along
with
hints
of
chocolate
malt
and
vanilla
smoothness
mildly
bitter
finishes
smooth
no
hint
of
alcohol
creamy
overall
this
was
extremely
enjoyable
another
beer
i
wish
i
had
access
to
more
often
i
would
recommend
this
is
a
phenomenal
stout
the
oatmeal
really
adds
substance
to
the
complexity
o
great
with
breakfast
great
in
general
let
me
point
out
that
the
java
head
stout
from
troegs
is
a
fantastic
porter
but
it
is
a
porter
not
a
stoutnonetheless
drinkability
and
overall
impression
easily
drinkable
but
is
a
beer
that
should
definitely
be
allowed
to
warm
to
about
55
degrees
before
drinking
the
full
complexity
of
the
flavor
is
hidden
a
bit
until
the
beer
warms
on
the
whole
what
i
would
expect
from
troegs
a
good
solid
beer
that
works
well
that
said
im
learning
i
dont
prefer
coffee
stouts
and
so
will
probably
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
or
pick
something
else
from
the
tap
list
the
pour
has
a
nice
milky
tan
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
almost
a
black
nonsee
through
terrific
looking
stout
not
much
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
but
very
faint
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouth
to
my
surprise
extremely
hoppy
for
a
stout
would
not
classify
as
an
oatmeal
stout
to
me
more
of
an
imperial
stout
nice
cocoa
liquidy
chocolate
taste
with
an
unexpected
hop
flavor
on
the
back
end
a
pretty
good
brew
maybe
well
above
average
o
decent
oatmeal
stout
not
sure
if
id
get
again
due
to
the
price
not
fitting
the
quality
overall
a
very
nice
brew
though
it
is
lacking
in
what
it
promised
to
deliver
coffee
there
are
many
better
stouts
out
there
but
there
are
also
much
worse
more
coffee
especially
in
the
nose
could
have
made
this
an
amazing
standout
o
pretty
decent
but
not
as
good
as
terrapin
wake
n
bake
or
the
even
more
impressive
founders
breakfast
stout
o
not
something
that
i
would
drink
again
well
i
was
expecting
some
coffee
to
this
brew
and
nada
the
pour
looked
real
nice
great
head
great
dark
color
basic
roastiness
in
the
aroma
and
taste
with
nothing
really
jumping
out
at
me
i
was
more
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
coffee
than
anything
overall
pretty
enjoyable
perhaps
not
a
favorite
coffee
angled
brew
but
easily
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
as
well
pretty
darn
good
kind
of
heavy
but
overall
a
good
beer
when
i
get
more
money
ill
definitely
buy
a
case
of
this
and
stock
this
in
my
fridge
overall
another
exceptionally
nice
brew
from
an
exceptional
brewery
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
me
and
stays
away
from
the
sweet
sticky
feeling
i
often
get
from
oatmeal
stouts
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
night
however
and
it
lacks
the
kind
of
flavor
oomph
id
want
from
a
moderately
heavy
beer
ill
definitely
pick
it
up
again
and
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
o
solid
look
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
coffee
was
not
overpowering
which
was
nice
o
pretty
disappointed
in
this
just
wasnt
as
complex
as
i
would
expect
not
a
very
good
stout
imho
overall
for
a
coffee
beer
this
was
actually
lacking
in
the
coffee
department
would
have
loved
more
the
beer
over
all
is
not
bad

kinda

all
in

a
very
good

not

coffee
stout
if
a
few
things
were
tweaked
a
little
bit
i
would
probably
enjoy
this
one
even
more
but
its
plenty
enjoyable
as
is
final
thoughts
take
this
beer
and
make
it
an
imperial
stout
and
i
think
we
have
a
winner
minus
the
smoke
and
light
ash
all
these
components
imperialized
would
be
fantastic
again
minus
the
smoke
and
light
ash
components
here
im
all
about
mouthfeel
with
stouts
so
that
would
explain
my
opinion
on
the
matter
here
well
done
id
say
though
on
what
was
trying
to
be
accomplished
somewhat
similar
to
old
rasputin
but
id
say
close
to
on
par
d
this
is
okay
really
needs
more
flavor
and
depth
drinkability
is
average
for
the
abv
the
beer
is
a
gorgeous
pour
but
everything
else
is
left
to
be
desired
the
smell
and
taste
barely
even
had
coffee
this
beer
is
clearly
not
one
they
will
be
known
for
what
they
got
right
was
how
an
oatmeal
stout
should
feel
and
how
i
envision
stouts
should
pour
i
dont
really
give
a
schlitz
about
java
head
though
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
a
good
stout
here
love
the
coffee
flavors
picked
up
in
their
french
press
through
extra
whole
leaf
hops
and
coffee
beans
gives
this
brew
a
truly
unique
taste
malt
flavors
power
this
beer
and
hops
give
it
a
great
balance
for
the
style
pours

a
dark
thick

a

not
as
tight
as

still

this
brew
again

sure

pours
an
intenselooking
black
with
about
an
18
inch
head
that
reduces
to
a
scattered
film
suggesting
low
carbonation
and
there
is
moderate
lacing
i
catch
an
earthy
roasty
chocolate
smell
taste
is
dominated
by
coffee
beans
oats
and
chocolate
a
very
wellbalanced
oatmeal
stout
with
the
roasty
malts
taking
over
and
the
hops
complimenting
very
nicely
low
to
medium
carbonation
the
strongness
of
the
coffee
beans
really
is
the
main
shield
against
the
7
5
abv
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
you
will
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
because
it
is
complex
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
notes
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
otherwise
its
not
too
shaby
cheers
it
goes
down
quite
well
but
the
light
sense
and
the
bitters
kind
of
put
me
off
after
a
while
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
full
bodied
stout
but
i
suppose
this
could
be
a
great
dry
stout
ill
have
to
develop
a
taste
for
that
d
absolutely
loved
this
beer
very
superb
no
hop
bitterness
all
the
coffee
notes
were
ideal
d
very
easy
drink
but
there
is
really
nothing
special
here
the
sweet
upfront
flavor
throws
me
off
a
little
here
this
beer
has
the
unluckiness
of
following
up
a
fbs
review
and
it
isnt
even
a
110
of
that
hopefully
i
wasnt
too
hard
on
it
as
it
is
a
decent
stout
id
get
this
again

a
single
overall
very
surprised
by
this
beer
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
an
oatmeal
stout
and
i
forget
how
enjoyable
they
are
very
drinkable
d
overall
this
stout
was
pretty
bitter
and
seemed
a
bit
brash
kind
of
surprised
to
find
this
much
flavor
packed
into
a
nonimperial
stout
d
alright
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
it
just
doesnt
compete
with
others
in
the
style
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
big
mocha
head
tons
of
complexity
in
the
nose
getting
a
lot
of
piney
hops
followed
up
by
creamy
coffee
and
oats
taste
is
a
bit
perplexing
starts
with
big
time
troegs
signature
hoppiness
but
is
accompanied
with
a
lot
of
creamy
coffee
flavor
the
mouthfeel
though
is
lacking
significantly
far
too
thin
and
the
coffee
loses
a
bit
of
what
was
found
in
the
nose
finishes
off
with
a
refreshing
bitter
bite
drinkability
is
good
with
the
low
abv
but
i
think
there
might
have
been
too
much
going
on
here
to
have
more
than
a
bottle
i
find
i
want
to
chug
this
bad
boy
down
and
go
find
another
i
wish
you
couldnt
see
the
average
rating
before
you
rate
yourself
a
b
seems
a
bit
low
for
this
beer
but
that
just
might
mean
that
this
one
matches
my
palate
better
than
it
did
for
others
this
is
also
the
first
troeg
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
nicely
done
taste
steps
up
instant
hoppy
punch
without
the
grapefruity
mentolation
broad
and
bitter
in
a
good
way
not
catching
the
coffee
yet
simple
actually
but
very
refreshing
near
perfect
viscosity
and
roil
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
basic
guinness
extra
stout
but
lighter
to
the
point
and
delicious
very
dry
finish
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
stout
the
sweet
is
well
blended
with
the
bitter
coffees
and
mild
hopsdecent
balance
of
all
the
flavors
that
are
in
this
stout
d
sort
of
an
odd
concoction
when
you
think
about
it
a
citrusy
herbal
hopped
up
coffee
stout
that
drinks
with
the
sweetness
of
an
oatmeal
or
milk
stout
as
well
it
doesnt
necessarily
jive
on
the
palate
all
the
time
and
the
7
5
abv
is
a
doozy
but
i
think
troegs
java
head
is
an
enjoyable
stout
that
doesnt
overdo
the
coffee
bitterness
at
the
expense
of
making
a
wellcrafted
and
balanced
stout
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
its
nothing
special
i
definitely
wish
id
gotten
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
beer
to
go
4
0
d
good
enough
beer
but
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
a
creamier
mouthfeel
still
i
doubt
id
pass
this
up
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
halffinger
width
tan
head
on
top
great
lacy
rings
left
behind
after
each
sip
the
nose
is
full
of
freshground
coffee
warm
cookies
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
mouth
is
creamysmooth
from
a
good
oat
presence
good
black
coffee
mild
hops
roasted
sugar
sweet
milk
chocolate
in
the
flavor
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
the
alcohol
is
noticed
faintly
on
the
back
end
but
its
not
as
prominent
as
expected
good
beer
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
oatmeal
coffee
stout
d
this
is
good
yet
not
my
favorite
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
liked
overall
a
solid
coffee
stout
d
this
is
a
decent
coffee
stout
could
have
been
a
little
bit
more
coffee
for
me
but
im
a
coffee
junkie
maybe
its
just
right
for
others
i
bet
its
good
on
cask
coffee
flavors
dont
come
to
full
fruition
as
the
hops
and
roasted
malt
mute
most
of
the
coffee
out
a
decent
stout
regardless
mfd
thick
and
chewy
coates
the
mouth
well
a
nice
stout
overall
a
very
well
made
and
unique
coffee
stout
one
ive
sought
out
a
few
times
d
a
bit
one
note
for
me
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
goes
down
easily
cant
go
wrong
with
any
of
troegs
beers
this
one
included
love
them
served
to
me
with
a
two
finger
offwhitetan
head
black
as
the
night
with
very
little
light
passing
through
smell
is
of
chocolate
malts
roasted
malts
and
a
little
coffee
taste
follows
suite
with
a
heavy
dose
of
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
and
coffee
the
coffee
element
is
very
muted
considering
the
use
of
coffee
in
the
brewing
process
i
like
the
subtle
coffee
flavors
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
name
finishes
clean
with
a
healthy
dose
of
bitterness
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semifluid
feel
on
the
tongue
nice
drinkable
stout
overall
it
just
needs
a
properly
fitted
name
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
smooth
it
drinks
as
an
oatmeal
stout
the
beer
is
expected
to
have
that
clean
refined
feel
as
it
sips
to
this
it
does
not
disappoint
to
note
the
label
is
also
very
inventive
for
something
with
a
coffee
element
in
the
name
the
aroma
and
subsequent
taste
could
have
focused
a
bit
more
on
infusing
that
characteristic
into
the
profile
but
in
the
end
the
drinker
is
left
satisfied
with
the
blend
provided
d4
5
dm
drinks
very
smoothly
slides
a
bit
thickly
across
the
pallet
great
taste
and
character
make
it
a
good
drinking
brew
strong
carbonation
presence
dgood
for
the
abv
a
tasty
beer
that
doesnt
overwhelm
and
remains
fairly
smooth
a
good
value
for
the
style
as
for
drinkability
need
i
say
any
more
a
very
nice
stout
for
sure
this
was
my
first
troegs
experience
and
it
obvious
that
they
put
some
effort
into
their
brews
next
up
the
troegs
hop
back
gotta
work
my
way
through
the
12
pack
this
week
merry
christmas
good
beer
enjoyable
not
to
bitter
easy
to
drink
edit
enjoyed
this
more
at
cellar
temp
more
chocolate
and
a
little
more
coffee
come
out
i
will
always
take
a
breakfast
stout
over
this
but
i
would
be
very
happy
as
this
beer
for
my
second
or
third
choice
22
ounce
bottle
pours
deep
brown
with
a
once
finger
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
recedes
to
a
thick
cap
great
glass
lacing
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
some
vanilla
taste
of
some
chocolate
and
coffee
lots
of
malts
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
not
that
strong
creamy
body
but
it
comes
out
a
bit
thin
feeling
solid
stout
pretty
good
drinkability
on
par
at
7
5
its
not
exactly
a
session
beer
but
the
drinkability
is
pretty
standard
its
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
but
not
top
of
the
line
definitely
an
enjoyable
stout
but
i
would
have
rather
seen
them
resurrect
the
oatmeal
stout
or
converted
scratch
27
into
a
year
round
stout
please
john
bring
back
scratch
27
or
the
oatmeal
stout
taste
for
java
head
contains
java
more
chocolate
malts
some
spices
such
as
cinnamon
very
rich
overall
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
coffee
stout
from
troegs
its
been
some
time
since
i
have
tried
something
from
troegs
and
i
am
happy
to
finally
get
around
to
this
one
this
is
one
beer
that
is
very
much
worth
your
time
moreys
bottom
line
one
of
troegs
only
offerings
that
i
had
yet
to
have
glad
i
did
never
had
their
oatmeal
stout
but
this
is
very
good
overall
overall
the
beer
was
decent
not
much
smell
or
chew
but
the
flavor
was
decent
it
delivers
on
the
coffee
taste
that
it
advertises
there
are
definitly
better
stouts
out
there
but
this
is
worth
a
try
for
any
coffee
flavored
stout
lovers
t
i
wouldnt
classify
this
as
an
exemplar
of
the
style
but
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
this
will
certainly
do
the
job
overallgreat
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
top
out
there
plenty
of
coffee
lives
up
to
the
name
very
well
done
d
with
the
strong
flavors
and
heavier
body
this
isnt
a
session
beer
its
a
great
after
work
or
desert
beer
though
arrived
with
two
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
excellent
retention
right
from
the
handpump
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
zero
light
penetration
except
at
the
edges
nose
had
qualities
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
charcoal
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
with
a
pronounced
darkroast
coffee
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
lingered
with
anise
bittersweet
chocolate
and
charcoal
very
dry
and
would
be
an
excellent
accompaniment
with
dessert
nice
lacing
throughout
another
fine
offering
from
the
troegs
brewing
company
and
ill
raise
my
glass
in
hopes
that
the
lowly
detroit
lions
can
find
a
way
to
knock
off
those
nasty
pats
while
i
enjoy
this
brew
medium
bodied
but
a
little
thin
considering
the
style
a
bit
of
chewyness
and
dry
edges
in
the
feel
smooth
easy
drinking
and
goes
down
pretty
quick
considering
the
abv
which
is
masked
very
well
another
hit
from
troegs
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
excellent
coffee
stout
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
flavors
if
you
like
coffee
and
beer
the
java
head
is
a
great
beer
for
you
i
have
the
opportunity
to
teast
this
beer
at
the
brewery
itself
in
the
teasting
room
was
a
good
hardy
stout
but
not
made
for
drinking
is
mass
amounts
the
beer
had
a
rich
coffee
smell
which
made
it
quite
interesting
overall
the
beer
was
good
d
delicious
for
coffee
lovers
thats
for
sure
this
is
a
world
class
coffee
stout
but
i
dont
think
they
do
enough
to
make
it
an
oatmeal
stout
the
oatmeal
plays
a
secondary
role
and
the
mouth
is
quite
thin
on
it
wish
it
had
more
coffee
flavored
influence
a
good
stout
poured
almost
black
into
my
favorite
snifter
foam
disippated
into
a
light
tan
ring
moderate
carbonation
roasty
toasty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
coffee
quite
honestly
not
as
coffee
forward
as
i
expected
same
with
the
taste
malt
backbone
a
hint
of
hops
nice
and
dry
but
only
mild
coffee
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
the
brew
was
certainly
easy
drinking
d
a
very
drinkable
coffee
stout
a
nice
rich
roasty
offering
perfect
for
a
cold
day
like
this
overall
a
decent
effort
i
was
craving
a
stout
and
reached
for
this
one
out
of
the
beer
fridge
and
it
hit
the
spot
like
i
said
it
wasnt
anything
like
i
expected
it
to
be
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
its
certainly
worth
a
try
this
one
poured
a
midnight
black
with
a
skimpy
khaki
head
that
laced
the
glass
it
smells
rich
and
sweet
almost
like
a
milk
stout
it
smells
of
coffee
beans
and
milk
chocolate
the
taste
too
echoes
the
milk
chocolate
probably
more
so
because
this
was
bottled
in
september
of
2009
it
has
really
good
flavor
rich
and
creamy
it
drinks
pretty
light
for
a
stout
and
is
a
light
to
medium
its
very
very
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
one
i
was
glad
i
picked
it
up
while
in
cleveland
java
head
stout
pours
with
a
very
dark
nearly
black
body
and
1
finger
of
creamy
tan
head
the
aggressive
pour
yielded
some
nice
retention
and
lacing
on
my
pint
glass
initially
the
predominant
aroma
is
chocolate
but
i
pick
up
some
coffee
and
roasted
malt
scents
after
a
few
more
whiffs
nothing
bold
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
more
pronounced
some
chocolate
upfront
with
some
nice
coffee
flavors
coming
through
in
the
middle
and
back
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
little
if
any
indication
of
the
7
5
abv
nice
to
see
this
become
a
year
round
offering
from
the
troegs
brewery
a
welcome
addition
to
my
fridge
very
nice
this
is
a
dense
black
beer
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
coffee
blackpatent
a
bit
of
booze
and
grain
the
taste
is
bitter
and
intense
espresso
bitter
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
bittering
hops
its
an
engaging
and
very
drinkable
beer
full
in
body
if
anything
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
coffee
it
could
be
a
bit
more
intense
still
very
good
pretty
drinkable
i
like
to
cap
off
the
night
with
a
stout
as
opposed
to
drinking
several
in
a
row
but
i
could
drink
another
one
of
these
after
this
no
problem
this
brew
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
as
some
have
stated
in
there
own
reviews
of
this
brew
drink
this
reminds
me
of
really
almost
drinking
coffee
its
cold
and
has
a
wonderful
flavor
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
drink
this
in
the
morning
this
is
another
great
brew
that
i
have
had
from
tröegs
d
good
overall
brew
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
good
also
it
is
very
drinkable
even
my
wife
liked
this
one
i
had
this
after
a
long
night
of
work
so
a
good
beer
was
needed
great
stout
with
a
strong
mouthfeel
finishes
smooth
but
there
is
a
little
heat
from
the
alcohol
but
in
a
good
way
flavors
of
citrus
coffee
and
caramel
make
this
an
all
around
enjoyable
experience
honestly
this
was
surprisingly
tasty
i
wasnt
worried
that
it
would
be
awful
at
all
troegs
knows
their
shite
overall
a
good
solid
stout
d
its
good
and
my
bottle
disappeared
quickly
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
when
shopping
for
a
coffee
stout
pours
jet
black
has
an
intensely
sweet
taste
almost
like
molasses
which
finishes
like
coffee
the
smell
is
all
too
much
like
coffee
overall
it
isnt
bad
but
other
tastes
make
it
taste
less
like
a
beer
and
more
like
carbonated
iced
coffee
feels
kind
of
smooth
a
bit
light
for
its
strength
goes
down
nice
enough
d
the
coffee
taste
after
the
swallow
is
refreshing
and
recalls
energizing
memories
of
drinking
actual
coffee
i
would
drink
it
during
the
day
instead
of
coffee
if
i
drank
beer
during
the
day
d
good
although
the
bitterness
seems
a
little
heavy
while
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
weak
still
good
but
not
a
stand
out
brew
in
this
style
m
very
light
if
you
like
chocolate
hops
and
imperial
stouts
are
too
much
for
you
this
is
the
beer
youre
looking
for
very
well
constructed
pours
a
really
really
deep
brown
that
is
bordering
on
black
with
a
bit
of
a
mocha
head
that
fairly
quickly
recedes
into
nothing
the
nose
is
fairly
one
dimensional
with
a
lot
of
coffee
but
thats
fine
by
me
as
it
is
quite
nicely
presented
the
taste
is
overloads
of
coffee
along
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
a
nice
creaminess
smooth
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
accentuating
the
coffee
flavor
a
really
nice
coffee
stout
pours
jet
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
in
the
aroma
coffee
and
roasted
malt
with
a
small
oatmeal
sweetness
in
the
taste
dry
coffee
roasty
malt
and
a
sweetness
that
almost
reminds
me
of
lactose
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
coffee
aftertaste
nice
coffee
presence
and
interesting
sweetness
quite
dark
seems
more
brown
than
black
at
first
glance
coppery
edges
dark
brown
cap
sort
of
thin
and
fine
with
a
rockier
collar
sticky
lacing
but
not
a
lot
of
it
smells
of
caramel
toffee
molasses
quite
sweet
light
roast
charcoal
chocolate
with
some
leafy
hops
solid
bitterness
throughout
growing
into
a
lingering
finish
sweet
and
malty
too
caramel
and
toffee
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
roasty
but
not
overly
so
hop
flavour
broke
up
the
sweetness
somewhat
adding
some
diversity
in
flavour
and
providing
balance
mild
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
quite
thick
and
palate
coating
lowish
carbonation
creamy
texture
with
just
a
hint
of
astringency
pretty
good
overall
while
theres
definitely
some
roast
i
didnt
find
it
overpowering
for
a
coffee
beer
id
certainly
have
it
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
as
ive
mentioned
before
in
previous
review
i
generally
give
aggressive
pours
this
one
pours
pitch
black
with
not
even
a
shred
of
head
to
be
found
this
looks
like
a
glass
of
flat
cola
hopefully
it
get
better
the
aroma
is
near
nonexistent
light
coffee
and
thats
about
it
not
much
to
be
found
so
far
on
this
one
the
taste
is
pretty
one
dimensional
as
well
charred
coffee
and
faint
hints
of
sweet
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
really
the
best
thing
about
this
for
me
its
silky
and
full
bodied
with
just
right
carbonation
not
the
best
ive
had
from
troegs
ill
finish
this
one
but
im
less
than
impressed
d
this
is
a
good
beer
hell
it
could
have
been
a
great
beer
if
someone
wants
something
with
coffee
in
it
id
send
this
their
way
any
day
alcohol
plays
out
nice
flavors
bouquet
and
appearance
all
leave
me
happy
if
only
it
felt
better
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
picked
up
a
6pack
as
this
is
one
enjoyable
beer
good
job
troegs
this
was
a
good
oatmeal
stout
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
very
balanced
this
was
unusually
very
easy
to
drink
not
as
filling
as
i
had
thought
the
alcohol
is
suuuper
well
hidden
if
it
werent
for
the
kinda
strange
aftertaste
this
would
have
scored
higher
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
in
dedham
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
thin
white
head
smell
had
a
faint
hint
of
coffee
taste
was
put
together
well
lots
of
flavor
of
chocolate
and
espresso
plus
the
added
roasted
taste
that
you
often
find
in
an
oatmeal
stout
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
though
not
watery
but
would
have
loved
it
to
be
thicker
drinkability
was
good
as
it
was
smooth
and
the
7
5
abv
was
not
really
detectable
a
decent
version
of
the
style
and
a
good
way
to
start
the
night
md
smooth
and
a
little
prickly
nice
mouthfeel
fairly
drinkable
but
id
eventually
get
a
little
tired
of
the
earthiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
oily
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
d
a
drinkable
oatmeal
stout
d
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
all
in
all
this
brew
started
great
but
ended
poorly
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
maybe
try
once
if
you
like
stouts
but
only
if
you
have
access
t
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
too
which
is
a
disappointment
to
me
lots
of
sweet
citrus
and
bittering
herbal
hops
coffee
is
second
and
its
not
that
great
its
kinda
like
an
acidic
cold
cup
of
coffee
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
chocolate
that
sweetens
things
up
and
brings
the
taste
to
a
balance
this
one
is
average
in
body
for
the
style
somewhat
thick
but
not
really
viscous
but
it
is
smooth
overall
with
high
carbonation
for
a
stout
overall
a
nice
mild
stout
that
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
after
the
first
chilly
rainy
day
of
fall
easy
to
drink
i
just
wish
most
aspects
of
this
brew
were
more
in
your
face
but
far
from
the
best
definitely
best
served
only
lightly
chilled
which
works
well
with
the
coffee
the
taste
is
a
bit
dominated
by
the
coffee
flavor

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
but
it
does
have
its
flaws
i
thought
the
nose
was
great
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
it
mostly
a
subtle
chocolatey
hop
bite
i
also
feel
that
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
this
style
its
still
solid
and
worth
the
6
i
paid
for
the
bomber
but
probably
wont
go
for
it
again
ive
been
looking
at
this
one
for
a
while
on
the
shelf
and
im
glad
i
finally
pulled
the
trigger
solid
brew
thats
well
worth
a
try
decent
lowkey
stout
the
bone
dry
finish
almost
recalls
a

there
is

contrast

this

is

i
had

it

i
wouldnt
seek
this

super
smooth
best
stout
ive
had
very
dark
thick
as
a
stout
should
be
not
a
lot
of
taste
this
looks
black
as
night
kind
of
weak
on
the
smell
a
robust
burnt
toasted
roasty
flavor
is
the
first
thing
i
noticed
next
comes
that
oatmeal
sweetness
id
hoped
for
followed
up
by
a
coffee
aftertaste
thick
but
not
russian
thick
overall
this
is
freakin
great
wow
overall
in
my
opinion
id
say
this
is
a
wonderful
oatmeal
stout
when
i
sit
back
and
look
at
its
qualities
it
works
straight
up
by
elysian
smooth
nutty
taste
the
smoked
malt
well
good
decent
o
this
one
had
loads
of
bitterness
it
was
completely
unbalanced
the
flowery
hops
really
did
not
go
well
in
a
stout
this
seemed
more
like
it
was
trying
to
be
a
thick
cda
than
an
oatmeal
stout
it
was
poorly
executed
this
was
a
drain
pour
with
no
guilt
good
drinkability
light
not
cloying
o
i
thought
this
was
great
the
mouthfeel
in
particular
o
complex
tastes
very
toasted
i
like
that
the
oatmeal
comes
distinctly
through
which
it
doesnt
often
for
the
style
overall
darn
good
beer
but
a
bit
too
tame
for
my
taste
to
call
it
great
i
dont
know
maybe
the
rogue
shakespeare
has
spoiled
my
taste
and
expectations
for
all
other
big
oatmeal
stouts
in
any
event
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
im
happy
with
this
outstanding
beer
from
the
left
coast
i
like
the
dark
stuff
and
while
it
is
bitter
its
fairliy
smooth
light
conversation
with
friends
or
simply
relaxing
this
beer
is
best
with
a
meal
pretty
incredible
stout
so
smooth
creamy
sweet
chocolatey
really
drinkable
and
pretty
nice
at
7

abv
nearing
imperial
range
definitely
has
big
bold
flavors
and
thick
imperial
stout
feel
with
creaminess
and
sweetness
of
oatmeal
stouts
very
nice
overall
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
luscious
and
rich
but
not
overpowering
and
hard
to
drink
a
great
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
helps
maximize
drinkability
if
elysian
were
easier
to
obtain
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
id
likely
buy
this
one
with
some
regularity
overall
an
a
imperial
oatmeal
stout
by
elysian
excellent
roasted
malts
and
bitter
cocoa
nib
flavour
that
sets
the
bar
in
this
beer
category
this
is
alot
better
than
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
just
what
i
think
overall
a
very
easy
drinker
for
an
imperial
stout
a
low
abv
makes
this
super
easy
to
drink
o
epically
drinkable
smooth
and
sweet
not
as
strong
as
most
stouts
with
this
much
flavor
and
feel
the
oatmeal
has
to
do
with
that
im
sure
really
tasty
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
bombers
in
a
sitting
and
not
feel
full
or
wiped
out
o
nice
but
sweet
stout
with
a
good
abv
will
definitely
seek
out
again
on
a
cold
ny
night
beautiful
looking
beer
chocolate

nuts
and
wood
malt
hits

followed
by

stellar
brew
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
char
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
oat
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
up
a
rocksteady
oatmeal
stout
thatll
never
disappoint
mo
softly
carbonated
on
the
mouthfeel
the
body
remains
medium
against
a
rather
rich
but
not
heavy
flavour
profile
this
imperial
oatmeal
stout
to
me
is
a
lovely
twist
of
the
older
concept
of
rich
and
oily
export
stout
that
benefits
from
good
craftsmanship
and
skilful
manipulation
of
aromatic
american
hops
absolutely
lovely
i
completely
agree
with
kangarooadem59
he
nailed
it
not
time
for
it
in
texas
yet
but
here
in
seattle
it
could
not
be
a
better
night
for
a
stout
light
the
fireplace
pour
into
a
fine
beer
glass
and
kickback
and
enjoy
every
taste
of
this
fine
beer
tonight
i
decided
to
make
sure
to
drink
at
least
one
stout
of
the
quality
every
week
the
roasted
malts
impart
an
acrid
bitterness
immediately
out
of
the
bottle
but
this
eases
with
each
sip
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
noticeable
theres
chocolate
later
with
citrusy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
theres
nohing
extraordinary
going
on
this
is
a
typical
stout
wth
medium
carbonation
and
medium
creamy
body
from
the
addition
of
the
oats
for
this
abv
i
prefer
the

this
is
definitely
serviceable
a
good
example
of
the
style

the

overall
quite
impressed
by
this
one
price

was
cheap
so
i
didnt

what
to
expect

after
having
it
ill
definitely
be
having
it

the

is
it
one
i
cant
think
of
any
other
way
to
put
it
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
rewarded
with
a
rich
colacolored
head
a
rich
dark

body
and
the
dark
roasted

characteristics
of
a
stout
by
itself
a
wonderful
drink
and
just
as
well
made
for
a
good

thats

sheryl
just
said
she
was
impressed
with
the
aftertaste
too
shes
not
supposed
to
talk
to
me
about
these
beers
but
i
will
let
it
slide
note
from
sheryl
what
that
was
never
a
rule
we
only
have
one
more
beer
to
review
from
them

i
plan

the

the

is
sticky

the
taste
of

beer
has
a
pretty
strong

the
mouthfeel
is

overall
this
is

pretty
good

overall
a
very
nice
stout
one
for
the
books
this
thing
is
made
to
chew
on
for
dessert
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
the
oats
are
used
quite
well
sadly
not
as
memorable
as
some
of
the
elysian
pumpkin
beers
a
stellar
take
on
the
oatmeal
stout
lots
of
malt
character
with
a
subtle

influence
crazy
amounts
of
chocolate
and
roast
worth
seeking
out
and
drinking
when
youre
looking
for
a

style
overall
this
is
certainly
one
well
crafted
oatmeal
stout
great
balance
and
incredible
mouthfeel
keeps
a
rich
taste
without
being
overly
packed
with
alcohol
the
beer
is
near
black
with
a
thick
beige
collar
the
aroma
is
perhaps
a
bit
weak
but
whats
there
is
nice
roast
and
chocolate
with
a
healthy
grain
presence
thick
robust
body
with
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
nice
beer
to
share
at
a
tasting
or
savor
over
the
course
of
an
evening
o
this
is
sort
of
like
a
hardcore
spiked
cup
of
joe
not
for
the
faint
of
taste
buds
nor
sessionseekers
this
stout
demands
your
undivided
attention
and
the
longer
you
enjoy
it
the
more
it
will
reward
you
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
which
was
unexpected
for
the
proclamation
of
this
being
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
it
was
modestly
carbonated
but
overall
not
wowing
and
lacked
the
feel
associated
with
the
style
the
price
point
on
this
is
set
low
enough
that
you
should
try
it
but
chances
are
you
will
feel
the
same
and
desire
no
need
to
revisit
purchased

alcohol
by

o
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
its
quite
hopped
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
so
this
helps
to
cut
through
the

and
improve
its
drinkability
p
s
i
did
not
truly
observe
colour
and
a
few
other
non
essential
traits
so
i
this
will
factor
into
my
rating
score
colour
being
the
main
one
as
i
was
drinking
in
poor
light
from
a
non
translucent
stein
peace
out
o
a
good
brew
nice
for
the
winter
months
very
tasty
and
pleasant
very
hearty
with
flavor
and
bitterness
that
needs
respect
highly
recommend
for
splitting
or
accompanied
by
food
o
nice
oatmeal
stout
good
amount
of
roast
and
chocolate
along
with
very
smooth
finish
o
excellent
oatmeal
stout
extra
oatmeal
really
brings
that
flavor
to
the
forefront
some
hop
bitterness
adds
some
nice
complexity
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
just
didnt
give
it
amazing
scores
due
to
the
relative
simplicity
of
the
brew
for
an
oatmeal
stout
it
is
one
of
the
best
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
this
category
is
great
for
dessert
or
fireside
chats
in
my
opinion
not
for
refreshment
of
course
or
maybe
with
breakfast
before
a
long
snowshoe
o
im
really
impressed
with
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
this
much
from
a
low
alcohol
content
for
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
there
is
a
delicious
smells
near
perfect
taste
good
looks
and
a
solid
well
balanced
mouthfeel
a
really
good
beer
i
would
definitely
try
again
not
bad
liked
it
more
than
i
might
have
anticipated
would
drink
again

o
a
great
oatmeal
stout
with
a
hop
bitterness
presence
on
the
finish
that
makes
for
a
unique
and
tasty
experience
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
offers
up
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
complement
the
chocolate
and
cocoa
notes
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
that
doesnt
hold
back
will
be
enjoying
this
many
more
times
over
the
winter
months
o
weighing
in
with
a
7
5
abv
i
cant
tell
one
of
the
creamiest
flavor
balanced
yet
still
rich
non
imperial
oatmeal
stouts
ive
enjoyed
good
job
solid
solid
solid
full
bodied
with
a
deeply
roasted
robust
dark
malt
flavor
thats
countered
by
lighter
malt
sweetness
and
faint
earthy
hop
bitterness
pretty
dry
and
almost
burnt
tasting
up
front
without
becoming
acrid
or
overwhelming
hints
of
burnt
toast
roasted
gourmet
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
of
course
oatmeal
followed
by
toffee
chocolate
cake
and
resinous
hops
lots
of
dry
bitterness
yet
this
big
beer
remains
well
balanced
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
its
complexity
overall
an
enjoyable
stout
the
flavor
of
this
ale
is
rich
and
complex
sweet
tart
bitter
and
savory
in
a
much
higher
quantity
than
i
usually
experience
in
a
beer
savory
is
not
a
flavor
i
typically
associate
with
beer
of
any
type
even
the
dark
ales
and
lagers
but
this
is
a
welcome
exception
o
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
the
smoothness
from
the
oatmeal
is
present
and
it
goes
down
well
my
wife
who
doesnt
drink
beer
choose
this
off
the
shelf
for
me
i
consider
myself
lucky
quite
enjoyable
stout
definitely
agree
with
the
bottle
in
that
this
is
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
bold
rich
flavors
pleasant
boozy
notes
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
but
its
simple
the
coffee
presence
would
satisfy
the
coffee
lover
and
those
that
like
to
have
coffee
as
a
note
or
in
the
background
a
nice
middle
ground
from
a
traditional
stout
and
oatmeal
stout
d
a
better
than
average
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
has
a
sweet
thick
body
but
also
the
complex
dark
roast
of
an
imperial
stoutl
really
a
hybrid
between
the
two
styles
it
is
more
drinkable
an
your
average
imperial
and
more
complex
than
an
oatmeal
stout
which
makes
for
an
enjoyable
experience
overall
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
malt
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
complex
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
heavily
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
as
well
as
some
oats
and
cream
notes
there
is
also
a
hint
of
smoke
thick
mouthfeel
and

bought
at

my

in

finally

up

i
didnt
like
it

the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
liked
it
pours

i
like

it
would
be

alcohol
in

it
doesnt
and
the
taste
it
taste
better
then
it
smells
your
thinking
its
gonna
gag
me
and
stick
in
the
back
of
my
thoart
but
it
doesnt
its
a
beer
to
drink
but
notall
the
time
but
give
it
shot
if
havent
tried
it
glad
i
did
o
a
good
oatmeal
stout
i
like
the
minimal
sweetness
with
moderate
bitterness
pretty
complex
and
it
goes

easy

can

nothing
id
go
out

my

for
but
good
c
viscous
smooth
body
delivers
flavors
directly
to
my
palate
finishes
a
touch
sweet
as
malts
meld
with
bittersweet
chocolate
love
oatmeal
stouts
and
this
is
a
good
straightforward
example
of
the
style
o
a
nice
hoppy
twist
on
a
stout
i
just
wish
this
hop
fad
would
calm
down
a
little
bit
and
leave
my
stouts
alone
almost
a
nice
twist
but
just
a
little
too
much
overall
very
good
nothing
revolutionary
just
really
solid
well
done
and
tasty
a
good
stout
nothing
amazing
this
beer
pours
a
thick
sludgy
oil
black
color
with
a
lively
tan
head
a
couple
inches
high
some
retention
there
are
some
yeast
floaters
in
there
as
well
smells
like
coffee
and
licorice
and
booze
flavor
is
more
malty
not
burnt
but
very
very
dark
roasted
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
flavor
plenty
of
coffee
and
maybe
even
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
feel
is
alright
low
carbonation
makes
it
feel
heavier
than
it
is
but
it
definitely
full
bodied
i
didnt
love
this
and
a
bomber
would
be
a
lot
but
i
did
use
about
half
of
it
in
a
pot
of
buffalo
chili
where
i
usually
use
porter
and
it
imparted
a
ton
of
rich
flavors
which
made
this
my
best
chili
yet
for
that
application
it
was
fantastic
for
a
drinking
stout
it
wasnt
my
favorite
overall
in
many
ways
this
beer
drinks
more
like
a
lighter
hopped
black
ipa
its
dryness
and
bitterness
are
quite
heavy
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
smooth
in
transition
and
flavor
but
this
it
was
not
it
left
some
rather
unpleasant
flavors
in
the
mouth
at
the
end
making
this
a
beer
i
would
likely
not
do
again
poured
from
bomber
to
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
1
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
roast
dominated
with
tones
of
earhty
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
licorice
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
with
an
initial
surge
of
roasted
malt
up
front
with
an
underlying
mild
bitterness
the
licorice
flavor
is
more
pronounced
than
in
the
nose
i
would
prefer
to
tone
it
down
a
bit
but
its
not
bad
chocolate
really
evens
the
beer
out
creamy
and
smooth
lingering
roast
flavor
well
carbonated
overall
good
it
would
be
better
with
by
reeling
back
the
licorice
flavor
in
my
opinion
but
still
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
os
would
have
more
in
the
fridge
or
cellar
if
i
could
o
very
impressed
with
this
brew
would
def
seek
out
again
o
i
love
it
o
recommended
i
liked
it
a
lot
an
imperial
oatmeal
but
not
over
the
top
still
approachable
and
drinkable
full
bodied
feel
a
bit
slick
well
carbonated
and
smooth
leaves
a
lingering
cocoacoffee
malt
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
an
incredibly
tasty
well
made
stout
well
hopped
which
is
always
welcome
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
thumb
and
half
width
brown
head
okay
lacing
a
great
sweat
and
roasty
aroma
of
barley
oats
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
starts
off
quite
roasty
and
sweet
and
finishes
bitter
and
hoppy
more
typical
of
a
black
ipa
hoppy
finish
than
the
bitter
coffee
finish
i
love
in
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
roasted
barley
oats
aniseed
and
burnt
tobacco
a
creamy
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
not
much
carbonation
i
wouldnt
have
minded
it
being
a
touch
thicker
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
wouldnt
have
minded
if
they
toned
down
the
aniseed
just
a
touch
and
cant
say
the
bitter
finish
was
executed
well
as
it
has
been
done
in
some
other
oatmeal
stouts
still
a
nice
oatmel
stout
that
id
be
happy
to
drink
again
overall
from
the
appearance
and
smell
the
beer
promised
a
lot
i
feel
like
while
the
burnt
flavours
round
the
beer
off
theyre
a
little
too
harsh
and
they
left
me
feeling
dry
and
unsatisfied
cheers
lampertland
overall
i
like
it
but
it
has
a
few
shortcomings
to
style
for
me
i
like
the
strong
oat
presence
though
i
think
i
would
have
again
though
overall
its
enjoyable
quite
good
however
the
dry
aspect
doesnt
seem
to
grab
me
if
ripping
dry
grain
and
char
and
roast
is
your
deal
you
will
love
this
beer
to
death
do
enjoy
i
could
have
another
o
an
average
oatmeal
stout
less
thick
than
id
like
and
a
standard
slightly
boring
flavor
profile
overall
definitely
something
i
would
not
get
again
kind
of
hate
hoppy
stouts
truthfully
but
this
is
only
average
at
best
a
very
good
stout
has
many
of
the
deep
dark
goodness
i
look
for
in
this
imperial
style
interesting
interaction
with
the
hop
bitterness
and
the
alcohol
they
seem
to
complement
each
other
nicely
for
a
big
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
better
thicker
head
but
otherwise
everything
else
comes
together
for
this
one
o
the
tobacco
is
a
huge
putoff
for
me
so
im
not
the
biggest
fan
plus
there
is
no
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
looks
so
good
but
dies
down
after
that
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
goblet
it
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
tan
head
about
a
fingers
thick
that
fades
fastand
leaves
minimal
lacing
smells
like
a
sweeter
heavy
roasted
stout
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
thick
bread
like
roasted
malt
and
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
the
creamy
bitter
chocolate
has
a
nice
compliment
for
just
under
8
this
brew
is
very
enjoyable
and
tame
on
the
carbonation
which
is
unique
and
in
a
bad
way
i
enjoyed
this
stout
and
for
then
less
that
4
a
bottle
i
consider
it
a
steal
excellent
chocolately
caramely
aroma
medium
level
of
carbonation
with
head
clinging
to
the
sides
head
lingers
long
after
pouring
with
brussels
lace
rich
dark
brown
pour
hard
for
light
to
penetrate
flavors
of
coffee
and
caramel
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
enjoyed
oa
sba
brew
sba
super
bad
ass
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
stout
to
drink
for
a
while
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
recent
memory
ton
of
roasted
notes
and
chocolate
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
glad
i
bought
this
and
would
buy
it
again
i
purchased
a
bottle
in
2010
and
have
been
aging
it
in
my
cellar
until
tonight
poured
into
a
brooklyn
brewery
oversized
snifter
dark
brown
colored
body
thin
white
head
meaning
some
carbonation
may
have
been
lost
over
time
spots
of
lacing
here
and
there
on
the
glass
smell
was
faint
mostly
coffee
but
just
a
slight
hint
of
butter
taste
was
enjoyable
lots
of
layers
of
coffee
roasted
grain
cocoa
and
maybe
some
cereal
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
there
was
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
on
the
palate
the
abv
was
toned
down
well
and
not
overly
noticeable
the
label
calls
itself
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
and
the
phrase
applies
well
its
much
more
potent
in
flavor
than
other
regular
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
overall
complex
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
nice
roast
malt
and
bitter
hop
balance
overall
great
tasting
oatmeal
stout
enjoyed
it
easily
one
of
the
best
oatmeal
stouts
in
resent
memory
excellent
down
right
near
perfect
example
taste
is
sweet
creamy
mellow
and
lots
of
chocolate
roast
coffee
and
a
nice
light
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
still
good
a
pleasant
quietly
unique
example
of
the
style
the
last
couple
of
imperial
stouts
ive
had
have
all
been
fairly
hoppy
rasputin
storm
king
etc
and
this
is
no
different
personally
hops
aint
what
i
look
for
in
a
ris
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
o
a
very
enjoyable
stout
with
powerful
flavours
the
name
fits
it
perfectly
the
middling
sourness
of
this
offering
may
be
a
tad
suggestive
of
a
generic
porter
but
everything
else
screams
out
lovely
amped
up
oatmeal
stout
well
tempered
all
pnwstyle
with
a
bit
of
a
dialing
down
of
the
ibusfromhell
that
im
starting
to
see
as
the
trend
round
these
parts
enjoyable
and
drinkable
at
least
until
that
alcohol
starts
to
claim
its
pound
or
so
of
flesh
all
around
a
great
beer
a
strong
oatmeal
stout
and
a
finely
balanced
one
at
that
none
of
the
flavors
overwhelm
only
enhance
pours
pitch
black
into
my
kona
brew
pint
glass
smells
of
oatmeal
and
alcohol
tastes
of
oatmeal
and
chocolate
which
is
a
nice
combination
i
dont
taste
much
alcohol
the
oatmeal
and
the
chocolate
dont
overwhelm
you
its
very
subtle
in
after
taste
this
is
my
first
offering
from
elysian
i
always
see
their
beers
everywhere
and
their
label
is
catchy
i
have
been
to
seattle
twice
and
havent
been
to
their
brewery
but
i
will
go
next
time
im
in
town
o
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
great
roastytoasty
notes
not
an
overpowering
coffee
flavor
definitely
will
purchase
again
o
liked
this
despite
the
heavy
smokiness
very
drinkable
enjoyable
mouthfeel
b
would
drink
again
od
i
could
put
back
a
bomber
of
this
no
problem
a
nice
winter
or
badweather
beer
i
think
it
used
to
be
higher
abv
though
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
i
usually
dont
a
lot
of
hoppiness
in
my
stouts
but
this
one
managed
to
really
integrate
the
flavors
nicely
the
juicy
citrus
really
meshed
with
the
smooth
oats
for
me
the
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasty
bitter
coffee
flavors
were
an
added
bonus
delicious
beer
overall
o
easy
to
drink
and
robust
its
bit
too
roasty
and
untempered
for
me
but
is
too
easy
to
drink
with
its
light
playful
body
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
ale
with
a
dark
tan
head
leaving
nice
lace
smell
of
rich
roasted
malts
coffee
and
some
dark
fruits
in
the
back
taste
has
lightly
sweetened
roasted
malts
coffee
dark
bitter
chocolate
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
very
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
full
bodied
stout
o
subtle
and
smooth
but
still
interesting
easy
drinking
but
at
the
same
time
its
definitely
something
thats
better
suited
for
slow
leisurely
drinking
the
mouth
starts
out
quite
creamy
but
doesnt
finish
well
thins
out
considerably
for
a
big
stout
such
as
this
the
mouth
needs
to
hold
its
ground
this
one
does
not
the
thinness
carries
over
to
the
flavor
as
well
weak
flavors
of
mild
roast
alcohol
and
chilled
old
coffee
meh
this
one
was
alright
nothing
that
would
cause
me
to
seek
this
out
again
maybe
on
tap
if
i
ever
saw
it
but
most
likely
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
this
is
my
second
beer
from
elysian
and
im
still
pretty
happy
ill
have
to
seek
out
some
more
of
there
brews
ive
discovered
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
an
american
imperial
stout
with
a
very
light
chocolate
aroma
a
very
clean
taste
with
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
a
very
small
head
with
a
beautiful
dark
color
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
a
very
good
beer
that
went
well
with
sapsuckers
decadent
dog
definitely
a
beer
i
would
like
to
drink
again
drinkability
is
good
for
a
stout
of
this
caliber
its
clean
and
welldone
with
a
tempered
alcohol
content
thatll
eventually
catch
up
with
you
but
for
about
5
a
bomber
you
really
cant
beat
value
like
this
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
from
elysian
pours
very
dark
and
black
with
a
bit
of
light
brown
head
that
sticks
to
the
corners
of
the
glass
decent
lacing
smells
very
roasty
and
malty
a
strong
scent
that
is
really
pleasant
tastes
very
roasty
almost
no
flavor
on
the
front
of
the
pallette
bitter
roast
on
the
finish
feels
a
bit
thin
not
the
same
thick
body
that
i
would
expect
on
an
imperial
stout
but
very
drinkable
less
abv
than
the
style
usually
calls
for
but
is
delicious
none
the
less
full
body
decently
carbonated
very
smooth
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
surprisingly
solid
drinking
nice
smoky
flavor
with
tempered
sweetness
and
the
abv
is
masked
well
this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
from
elysian
yet
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
lead
off
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
gives
way
shortly
to
a
nice
roastiness
like
coffee
beans
there
is
some
chocolate
like
bitterness
in
there
as
well
beer
is
a
little
hot
perhaps
but
its
not
very
distracting
the
heat
gets
mostly
lost
in
the
forward
malt
syrup
sweetness
beer
is
pretty
easy
drinking
for
as
big
as
it
is
decent
big
stout
in
my
opinion
id
have
it
again
great
feel
and
fine
taste
this
is
a
great
drinking
imperial
oatmeal
stout
nice
subtle
yet
clear
flavors
intertwine
nicely
it
never
loses
the
clarity
and
no
single
flavor
becomes
dominant
as
is
frequently
the
case
excellent
overall
beer
pours
black
with
a
singlefinger
tan
head
with
moderate
retention
this
falls
down
to
a
collar
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
pretty
sweet
to
start
with
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
as
well
as
some
sweetness
coffee
and
maybe
a
hint
of
black
licorice
the
taste
is
mostly
chocolatefocused
with
some
roasted
malt
in
there
as
well
a
bit
of
booze
coming
through
in
the
end
and
this
takes
over
a
bit
in
the
feel
which
consists
of
a
somewhatlow
carbonated
brew
with
a
pretty
big
body
drinks
well
enough
but
not
a
standout
among
the
style
good
drinkability
very
tasty
the
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
warrant
drinking
multiples
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
stout
alcohol
sneaks
up
at
the
end
but
you
barely
noticable
in
the
beginning
it
gives
a
warm
sensation
as
it
goes
down
probably
from
the
decent
amount
of
alcohol
which
7
45
you
really
can
notice
the
aroma
of
yeast
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
overall
i
really
liked
this
brew
it
checks
in
on
the
low
side
of
imperialdouble
stouts
which
gives
you
the
best
of
both
worlds
robust
flavors
but
a
smoother
easy
drinking
body
this
brew
comes
across
almost
like
a
milk
stout
on
the
sweet
side
and
dominated
by
chocolate
but
theres
just
enough
espresso
character
to
balance
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
very
flavorful
and
easydrinking
overall
d
the
lack
of
alcohol
hotness
helps
with
the
drinkability
but
i
find
it
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
a
heathly
tasting
pour
overall
great
beer
true
to
the
spirit
of
the
style
and
packing
a
well
hidden
punch
this
is
a
beer
i
will
be
returning
to
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
bigger
stout
with
year
round
availability
d
im
normally
not
one
for
stouts
but
this
is
really
good
i
would
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
one
of
the
best
elysian
beers
ive
had
as
far
as
bitterness
goes
this
doesnt
have
as
much
as
most
imp
stouts
even
when
cold
theres
the
graininess
that
you
get
when
roasted
malts
are
used
in
abundance
and
the
alcohol
is
very
wellmasked
thats
partially
because
this
does
not
have
as
high
an
abv
as
most
imp
stouts
it
sits
at
the
bottom
of
the
style
for
that
so
you
can
drink
even
more
of
it
right
sure
give
it
a
go
after
it
settles
a
bit
the
graininess
is
mitigated
and
the
beer
becomes
really
silky
smooth
this
is
one
nicely
crafted
stout
d
yeah
try
it
drink
it
drinks
like
a
nice
creamy
stout
latte
creamy
and
rich
with
toasted
oatmeal
flavors
dominating
and
giving
way
to
a
light
chocolate
sweetness
and
a
dry
finish
i
believe
there
may
be
periods
where
this
goes
down
too
easy
but
as
an
oatmeal
stout
it
drinks
well
and
an
imperial
pint
was
more
than
appealing
for
this
type
of
beer
would
be
a
perfect
beer
breakfast
because
it
is
so
rich
and
creamy
over
using
this
word
i
know
but
this
is
was
both
my
appetizer
and
dessert
at
elliots
caramel
malt
undertones
creaminess
from
oats
velvety
dark
fruits
roasty
dry
finish
that
lingers
with
a
moderate
level
of
bitterness
tongue
drying
but
not
moisture
zapping
dark
chocolatelike
finish
solid
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
when
i
rate
a
beer
i
like
to
use
a
pilsner
glass
to
note
the
color
head
and
lacing
the
color
ranged
from
dense
black
the
color
of
a
hole
to
dark
mahogany
when
held
up
to
light
great
tan
head
and
lacing
expected
of
a
fine
brew
the
taste
was
sweet
sulawesi
it
poured
thick
over
my
tongue
as
it
slowly
sought
the
lower
elevations
of
my
mouth
drinkable
im
not
sure
wink
wink
better
have
another
i
throughly
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
wasnt
all
that
satisfied
it
is
a
dark
chcolate
color
with
minimal
light
brown
head
tons
of
lacing
though
which
makes
me
want
to
enjoy
this
beer
it
smelled
really
malty
and
my
nose
twinged
when
i
got
that
strong
chocolate
aroma
thanks

each
3
remaining
to
trade
d
a
great
all
around
beer
and
one
to
go
back
to
for
sure
abv
is
well
hidden
very
smooth
with
terrific
carbonation
this
is
another
stout
that
doesnt
push
any
envelopes
with
the
style
but
its
still
enjoyable
because
of
the
bitter
hops
i
was
glad
to
try
it
but
dont
need
to
revisit
in
the
future
drinkability
quite
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
all
in
all
this
is
ok
not
phenomenal
but
ok
good
to
try
once
but
not
worth
hunting
down
d
very
drinkable
especially
after
a
hard
day
on
the
mountain
pretty
good
stout
medium
body
smoothvelvety
and
rich
mouthfeel
lots
of
semisweet
chocolate
roasted
barley
toasted
oats
and
slight
booze
the
warmer
it
gets
the
thicker
it
feels
in
the
mouth
ive
never
seen
nor
heard
of
this
beer
before
and
it
was
just
a
random
pickup
today
i
have
to
say
im
pretty
pleased
and
not
let
down
at
all
drinkability
is
also
good
i
enjoyed
reminiscing
of
my
trip
with
this
souvenir
great
job
elysian
d
this
one
definitely
falls
between
the
classic
oatmeal
stout
and
overthetop
imperials
that
are
all
the
rage
these
days
a
restrained
balanced
effort
that
is
worth
seeking
out
a
very
solid
oatmeal
stout
a
lot
of
bold
flavors
that
compliments
the
creamy
mouthfeel
beautifully
probably
my
favorite
from
elysian
so
far
this
is
quite
a
tasty
brew
d
beautiful
a
bit
lower
on
the
abv
and
this
would
make
a
killer
session
beer
as
it
is
now
id
call
it
dessert
i
like
it
better
than
fbs
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
and
and
quite
pleased
with
it
one
i
would
certainly
purchase
again
smooth
not
too
sweet
and
tasty
mouth
thicker
than
it
looks
is
the
first
impression
healthy
roast
flavors
and
lingering
burnt
toast
some
of
that
burnt
sugar
again
an
acrid
finish
fore
flavors
are
better
than
hind
flavors
goes
well
w
my
burger
though
mouthfeel
is
thick
yet
highly
carbonated
think
the
body
could
stand
to
be
a
little
thinner
lower
in
alcohol
but
its
quite
alright
drinkability
a
big
brick
one
bomber
is
enough
maybe
too
much
for
a
session
drinkability
overall
is
solid
i
have
no
gripes
with
the
beer
or
the
flavor
and
i
enjoyed
my
opportunity
to
try
this
pacnw
offering
from
seattle
i
havent
had
many
brews
from
that
region
and
im
glad
that
this
one
came
my
way
to
further
my
horizons
very
enjoyable
up
there
in
the
realm
of
breakfast
stout
wake
and
bake
javahead
and
other
big
beers
within
this
vein
drinkability
the
7
4
abv
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
imperial
stout
but
the
tartness
of
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
make
this
a
oneanddone
for
me
if
the
beer
is
allowed
to
warm
it
becomes
far
more
drinkable
in
both
categories
but
overall
this
beer
just
leaves
me
feeling
sort
of
meh
the
body
was
full
and
coating
without
being
overly
heavy
drinkability
was
very
good
for
such
a
big
full
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
and
perhaps
some
effort
to
obtain
this
stout
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
lasting
tan
head
aromas
are
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
oatmeal
as
this
stout
warms
up
so
do
all
the
flavors
the
hops
are
under
control
so
this
treat
went
down
way
too
damn
smooth
i
felt
this
was
just
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
but
hey
i
am
not
complaining
it
is
so
civilized
at
a
little
more
than
7
abv
i
feel
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
a
truly
unexpected
surprise
definitely
recommended
out
of
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
and
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
dark
brown
color
and
nearly
opaque
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
ecru
colored
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
rich
roasted
grains
bittersweet
chocolate
molasses
brown
sugar
sweet
caramelized
malt
between
medium
and
full
in
body
and
amply
carbonated
for
the
style
certainly
decent
enough
to
have
again
another
time
d
good
drinkability
leaves
you
thirsty
for
more
i
cant
explain
it
and
my
beer
is
just
sitting
here
waiting
to
be
drank
for
me
this
stout
was
way
out
of
balance
not
a
beer
i
would
pick
up
again
this
is
an
excellent
stout
with
a
great
combination
of
roasted
malts
and
big
sweetness
its
complexity
and
heft
put
it
on
the
border
of
impy
stout
status
very
very
tasty
very
good
stout
label
art
aside
its
a
good
stout
with
a
rich
sweet
chocolate
coffee
roasted
stout
flavor
the
beer
pours
dark
and
looks
thick
and
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
the
aroma
is
jumping
between
a
good
chocolate
milk
shake
with
a
dash
of
espresso
and
one
of
those
cheap
italian
espresso
soda
things
so
its
a
mixed
bag
but
ultimately
good
the
flavor
is
also
fairly
sweet
but
it
has
some
bite
theres
more
to
it
than
i
was
expecting
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
rich
and
full
a
beer
that
tastes
bigger
than
its
size
feel
is
smooth
with
a
mildly
acrid
finish
drinkability
is
good
but
its
a
fairly
light
for
the
category
overall
i
have
to
say
this
was
pretty
darn
tasty
not
quite
up
there
with
the
big
boys
but
definitely
something
i
would
not
mind
going
towards
again
i
could
see
myself
trying
another
one
for
sure
d
an
overall
good
stout
nothing
over
top
just
an
all
around
really
goodbalanced
ale
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
recommended
drinkability
abv
is
not
detected
flavor
is
good
finish
is
thin
overall
i
would
say
its
highly
drinkable
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
one
inch
cocoa
colored
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
thin
head
that
stays
as
you
drink
this
it
leaves
thick
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
strong
with
roasted
malts
and
bitter
coffee
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
that
adds
a
sweetness
to
the
scents
this
flavor
of
this
beer
is
dominated
with
semisweet
chocolate
and
has
a
bitterness
that
lasts
it
has
a
heavy
to
medium
body
that
coats
your
mouth
with
every
sip
i
really
like
this
beer
its
highly
drinkable
and
extremely
enjoyable
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
awesome
stout
for
sure
wow
loving
it
more
impressive
then
i
recall
the
oatmeal
version
although
its
been
quite
a
while
since
i
had
that
one
this
one
gets
extra
points
for
being
a
decent
value
and
year
round
staple
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
stout
and
it
is
relatively
inexpensive
i
believe
around
4
69bomber
i
do
not
believe
elysian
has
distribution
much
further
than
the
pacific
northwest
so
i
recommend
to
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
overall
taste
but
lacking
some
complexity
and
power
again
a
good
stout
but
not
so
good
as
imperial
d
its
too
bad
ramnuts
is
just
gifting
me
these
and
i
cant
evaluate
value
here
thanks
again
buddy
anyway
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
this
one
but
all
things
considered
id
probably
pick
something
else
as
my
goto
stout
unless
this
has
an
attractive
price
below
5
or
so
pours
black
with
a
fluffy
and
off
color
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
slightly
chalky
the
flavor
is
sweet
milky
rich
and
dry
it
is
roasted
and
slightly
chocolatey
with
a
hint
of
wood
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
quite
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
this
beer
is
one
of
those
ultra
black
oily
stouts
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
most
extreme
trait
this
sorta
rolls
out
on
your
tongue
the
flavor
itself
is
bold
malty
chocolatey
very
drinkable
not
the
strongest
stout
out
there
read
you
can
easily
drink
one
of
these
without
feeling
bombed
but
by
no
means
a
pushover
this
is
a
solid
stout
that
deserves
your
attention
and
will
reward
you
back
grab
this
one
when
you
see
it
and
dig
in
sample
at
the
pike
street
location
pours
black
with
a
medium
dark
beige
head
that
dissipates
steadily
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
contains
chocolate
malt
anise
and
coffee
rich
and
smooth
body
with
flavors
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
plus
some
hops
and
spices
the
finish
is
roasty
with
a
chocolate
and
espresso
flavor
that
lingers
awhile
very
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
d
this
was
an
exceptional
stout
by
elysian
everything
was
there
and
i
can
wait
to
try
more
of
their
beers
pours
a
straight
black
slightly
viscous
syrup
their
is
a
little
light
bosco
syrup
cling
after
ever
swirl
barely
any
head
after
the
pour
and
none
after
the
first
sip
heavy
mocha
aroma
french
roast
coffee
grounds
and
some
faint
milk
mixed
with
bitter
chocolate
very
roasty
the
taste
starts
creamy
and
syrupy
the
milk
chocolate
and
espresso
slowly
strenghen
towards
the
finish
well
integrated
mix
of
flavors
and
faint
alcohol
in
the
mouthfeels
finish
very
glad
i
ordered
this
beer
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
flavorwise
but
i
have
trouble
seeing
it
as
an
imperial
stout
its
more
like
a
strong
american
stout
comparable
to
the
cadillac
mt
or
shakespeare
stouts
id
say
d
this
is
my
desert
tonight
with
a
little
blue
cheese
pours
a
rich
black
color
with
a
nice
looking
medium
sized
brown
head
lots
of
roasty
toasty
grain
in
the
nose
sweet
chocolate
malt
comes
through
as
well
as
subtle
notes
of
ground
coffee
good
flavor
surprising
bitterness
which
i
really
enjoyed
medium
bodied
for
an
imperial
stout
but
that
factored
with
the
moderate
abv
make
for
a
very
drinkable
brew
well
done
by
far
my
favorite
offering
from
elysian
so
far
a
highly
enjoyable
imperial
oatemal
stout
d
sometimes
i
struggle
with
the
idea
of
giving
5s
for
scores
and
this
beer
challenged
me
quite
a
bit
i
have
found
yet
another
great
stout
since
my
move
to
the
west
coast
it
does
not
get
much
better
than
this
rich
malty
complex
and
smooth
has
to
be
a
5
drinkability
good
notes
i
could
see
this
becoming
a
goto
middle
of
the
road
everyday
stout
if
it
were
reasonably
priced
and
more
easily
found
sometimes
a
stout
is
just
a
stout
and
when
its
this
tasty
just
being
a
stout
is
a
good
thing
its
got
all
the
right
parts
put
together
in
a
fetching
way
its
bold
but
mannered
the
abv
is
north
of
average
but
even
with
that
it
drinks
smooth
and
well
its
not
double
imperial
caveaged
in
amontillado
casks
with
vanilla
and
premium
espresso
tossed
in
no
instead
its
a
good
gracious
enjoyable
stout
that
ill
pour
gladly
any
day
dragonstooth
one
word
apparently
is
elegant
in
multiple
capacities
the
plush
creaminess
forward
leaning
mocha
mojo
and
overall
graceful
contours
the
beer
also
shows
a
dark
tan
head
with
exaggerated
lace
and
a
dark
placid
body
though
its
gentle
malt
aroma
doesnt
factor
strongly
dragonstooths
initial
sweetness
and
approachable
complexity
make
it
easy
to
return
to
year
in
and
year
out
for
a
stout
its
not
that
heavy
more
medium
bodied
and
quite
enjoyable
therefore
i
think
you
could
drink
a
little
more
becasue
it
doesnt
fill
you
up
so
much
mediumbodied

dark
but
not

yet
pleasantly
strong

cant
wait
to
return
to
this
one
another
night
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
chocolatey
scent
with
a
dry
coffeelike
earthiness
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
black
and
chocolate
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
an
earthy
feel
its
only
slightly
warming
in
the
finish
the
chocolate
malts
really
make
the
flavor
with
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
trendous
beer
its
rich
with
malt
complexity
and
has
a
lovely
mouthfeel
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
irs
i
have
ever
had
great
beer
with
a
small
price
tag
if
avaliable
would
be
one
of
my
go
to
winter
brews
roasted
oaty
maltiness
with
a
dash
of
coffee
flavors
to
balance
it
all
out
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
stouts
ive
ever
had
a
guy
could
easily
drink
two
or
three
22

bottles
and
not
realize
it
until
the
alcohol
hit
not
that
id
know
anything
about
that
d
a
very
good
tasting
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
filling
while
they
did
well
to
complement

a

definitely
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
ris
though
a
little
more
on
the
mild
side
but
very
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
opening
a
bottle
for
that
ris
desire
without
having
to
drink
a
bottle
of
one
of
the
rarer
brews
rather
thin
for
the
style
that
aftertaste
really
hurts
this
one
aside
from
that
this
would
be
a
great
beer
but
when
the
last
flavor
in
your
mouth
is
medicinal
and
pungent
everything
before
it
doesnt
really
matter
d
a
nice
sipper
well
balanced
with
all
the
elements
you
want
in
a
stout
the
lack
of
body
makes
it
easier
drinking
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
picked
this
up
for
under
4
for
a
bomber
what
a
great
deal
on
an
insanely
drinkable
ris
price
often
factors
into
my
drinkabilty
score
when
coupled
with
the
great
tastiness
without
a
punishing
abv
makes
this
the
closest
ive
ever
come
to
seeing
a
session
ris
of
course
youd
be
better
off
savoring
this
one
slowly
to
appreciate
it
poured
into
my
duvel
tulp
glass
poured
a
heavy
black
that
cant
be
seen
through
with
a
heavy
one
finger
darker
tan
head
that
quickley
fades
to
a
lacing
around
the
rim
the
taste
is
sweet
with
hints
of
mollases
coffiee
rich
dark
malts
a
hint
of
hops
fine
belgan
dark
choclate
this
is
smooth
from
start
to
finish
this
one
hides
the
alchoal
well
the
second
pour
is
so
much
better
than
the
first
this
is
a
world
class
beer
for
sure
drinkability
is
high
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
regular
stouts
definitely
cant
really
session
this
one
at
its
higher
abv
and
thicknessfull
flavorness
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
ones
ill
turn
to
when
im
craving
stout
next
time
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
molasses
and
malty
though
i
have
to
confess
its
hard
to
smell
anything
after
walking
out
in
the
cold
flavor
is
thick
with
malts
and
a
molasses
thick
almost
tar
thing
going
on
mildly
smooth
same
goes
for
liquid
feel
carbonation
is
low
but
bites
a
bit
a
very
easy
drinking
double
stout
pretty
much
black
in
colour
with
dark
brown
edges
a
dense
frothy
two
finger
cap
of
brown
foam
appeared
after
a
hard
pour
leaving
behind
chunky
clinging
lace
as
it
fell
very
slowly
very
malty
aroma
a
combination
of
caramel
sweetness
and
roast
chocolate
notes
were
evident
as
well
as
very
light
hopping
very
smooth
texture
fine
bubbles
wellintegrated
carbonation
sweet
up
front
but
grassy
and
light
citrus
hop
flavours
melded
immediately
with
caramel
roast
and
toffee
bitterness
grew
into
the
finish
becoming
quite
prominent
just
a
bit
of
chocolate
appeared
midpalate
the
body
was
just
a
bit
more
than
medium
a
little
light
for
the
style
yet
this
made
for
a
more
drinkable
beer
as
did
the
near
lack
of
noticeable
alcohol
not
bad
at
all
not
bad
at
all
not
the
most
memorable
high
tests
stouts
ive
tried
but
would
be
interested
in
making
the
trip
to
try
it
on
tap
in
seattle
dbe
careful
i
want
more
but
only
have
one
as
rich
as
it
is
it
drinks
incredibly
well
alcohol
is
dangerously
disguised
malty
but
balanced
a
very
nice
stout
to
say
the
least
an
excellent
choice
thats
definitely
recommended
just
another
reason
why
its
wonderful
to
be
a
beer
fan
in
pennsylvania
d
this
exceeded
my
initial
expectations
i
would
have
liked
to
see
it
increased
a
couple
percentage
points
on
the
abv
but
regardless
this
drinks
like
a
nice
dessert
i
can
see
myself
picking
this
up
quite
regularly
through
the
fall
and
winter
d
smooth
and
silky
on
the
tongue
yet
didnt
really
make
the
taste
buds
dance
a
moderately
decent
drinking
stout
without
doing
my
homework
i
had
expected
a
dry
stout
sitting
down
to
review
it
i
discovered
it
listed
as
an
american
double
the
truth
is
it
lay
somewhere
in
between
it
has
the
rich
cast
of
character
like
an
imperial
but
the
drinkability
of
an
average
stout
the
already
empty
glass
in
front
of
me
is
proof
of
that
fortunately
for
me
that
glass
only
held
half
the
bottle
d
decently
drinkable
and
midlevel
abv
tasty
brew
thanks
for
the
bottle
torchednoodle
o
very
good
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
im
between
scores
on
the
drinkability
because
of
the
complexity
this
beer
is
a
prime
example
much
like
samuel
smiths
is
that
an
imperial
stout
doesnt
have
to
be
loaded
with
alcohol
to
be
great
i
took
my
sweet
time
enjoying
this
beer
trying
to
pick
out
every
flavor
and
let
it
coat
the
mouth
however
after
i
was
done
with
the
bomber
i
was
ready
to
move
on
to
something
on
the
lighter
side
give
it
a
try
recommended
no
big
surprises
there
are
typical
notes
of
chocolate
molasses
and
coffee
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
which
i
always
appreciate
overall
very
tasty
and
incredibly
smooth
excellent
stout
this
is
a
tasty
stout
and
one
ill
seek
out
again
borders
on
the
imperial
category
full
complex
flavor
this
is
a
stout
that
pulls
short
of
being
a
ris
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
the
beer
pours
black
and
full
headed
with
the
roasty
hoppy
notes
on
the
nose
when
you
get
to
drinking
you
realize
that
drinkability
is
key
for
this
beer
though
the
abv
approachs
8
the
finish
is
long
but
almost
oatmeal
stoutlike
in
style
dont
expect
the
vinous
ris
notes
but
rather
enjoy
a
great
drinking
stout
ive
seen
this
one
in
the
stores
and
passed
it
by
many
times
so
glad
i
decided
to
try
it
this
time
and
this
will
certainly
not
be
the
last
pours
a
complete
midnight
black
with
a
full
three
finger
brown
head
that
takes
its
time
to
fall
to
a
fluff
layer
of
bubbles
an
amazing
thick
wall
of
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
smokey
roasted
malts
chocolate
molasses
and
coffee
grinds
hops
make
their
presence
known
in
the
aroma
as
well
very
nice
nose
to
this
one
toasted
grains
smoked
barley
and
bitter
hops
up
front
in
the
flavor
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
midway
with
more
bitterness
aftertaste
is
full
of
molasses
and
touch
of
vanilla
medium
to
full
body
with
a
bit
of
a
watered
down
feel
carbonation
is
subtle
but
fits
the
beer
well
a
very
enjoyable
impy
stout
for
sure
one
worth
seeking
out
overall
enjoyable
beer
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
it
wasnt
much
of
an
imperial
no
alcohol
sting
to
it
at
all
it
was
wellbalanced
and
highly
quaffable
but
i
doubt
it
will
age
well
frankly
the
pleasure
was
too
much
in
the
balance
and
with
age
that
would
get
muddied
so
i
guess
id
say
a
good
but
not
special
beer
drinks
a
bit
slow
but
maybe
to
be
expected
on
a
warm
summers
evening
not
a
bad
imp
stout
a
bit
offstyle
more
on
the
restrained
side
think
odell
imp
for
instance
so
far
nothing
but
winners
from
this
brewery
da
solid
ris
very
full
flavoured
and
well
rounded
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
d
around
the
middle
for
an
is
but
i
like
that
style
a
lot
so
its
above
average
overall
d
its
too
much
beer
for
a
long
session
but
i
could
enjoy
two
or
three
bombers
before
the
sweetness
and
big
body
would
overcome
my
lust
drinkability
a
fine
tasty
stout
from
elysian
pours
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
ring
roasty
and
creamy
aromas
are
nice
but
a
little
light
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
medium
roastiness
creaminess
a
bit
of
licorice
and
chicory
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
smooth
and
relatively
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
an
easier
drinker
and
well
crafted
pours
black
with
a
short
lived
tan
head
smell
is
mild
dark
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
cardboard
taste
is
dry
burnt
roastiness
medium
bodied
with
similar
carbonation
a
bit
ashy
and
slightly
bitter
from
the
nice
sharp
hops
could
use
a
touch
more
body
but
the
dark
burnt
flavor
is
nice
22oz
bomber
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
thick
pitch
dark
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
and
a
lot
of
roasted
coffee
flavors
explode
from
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
dark
roasted
malts
up
front
with
some
bitter
coffee
flavors
in
the
finish
and
a
good
dose
of
lingering
hops
this
brew
is
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
as
far
as
stouts
go
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
thick
and
slightly
chewy
overall
this
is
a
very

that
is

dthis
is
a
delicious
stout
went
really
well
with
an
oyster
sampler
at
the
brooklyn
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
and
would
if
i
lived
in
seattle
overall
i
went
to
lunch
not
expecting
much
of
a
craft
beer
selection
but
this
was
a
very
nice
surprise
on
the
brooklyn
seafoodsteak
house
menu
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
would
make
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
locally
hard
to
improve
on
the
drinkability
of
this
one
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
7
abv
brew
the
alcohol
is
masked
nicely
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
a
very
drinkable
stout
indeed
draft
at
elysian
fields
in
seattle
i
had
this
beer
and
the
porter
and
this
was
definitely
the
better
of
the
two
poured
a
midnight
black
with
a
large
welllacing
tan
head
that
showed
good
retention
very
rich
roasty
nose
but
every
now
and
then
it
seemed
more
subdued
and
fainter
flavours
included
chocolate
and
caramel
and
there
was
a
pleasant
bitterness
from
deeply
roasted
coffee
grinds
full
creamy
body
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
this
bottle
is
better
than
i
had
remembered
dragonstooth
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
one
finger
tanbrown
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
with
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
has
some
alcohol
tones
but
is
mostly
of
bitter
chocolate
the
first
taste
is
much
richer
and
more
chocolaty
than
i
had
expected
great
dark
chocolate
and
mocha
type
flavors
the
finish
has
some
alcohol
with
a
little
hoppy
bite
this
is
an
interesting
brew
and
more
complex
than
i
had
expected
at
7
4
it
is
slightly
on
the
weak
side
for
an
imperial
but
is
thick
and
chewy
like
one
with
the
finish
and
smoothness
of
an
oatmeal
stout
i
like
it
i
think
it
is
an
interesting
beer
unusually
refreshing
and
drinkable
for
a
stout
of
its
kind
a
solid
beer
nothing
incredibly
extraordinary
but
a
solid
brew
d
nice
sipper
and
my
girlfriend
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy

some
sticky

the
taste
is
slightly
sweetbitter
malty
some
nice
tones
of
toffeecoffeecaramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
double
stout
recommended
its
understandable
why
this
one
costs
a
little
extra
drinkability
is
good
this
one
scores
points
for
being
interesting
and
unique
and
its
certainly
worth
a
try
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
imperial
stout
overall
recommended
an
altogether
tasty
ris
i
taste
the
malt
right
off
and
the
higher
abv
is
apparent
the
chocolate
flavor
arrives
in
the
palate
and
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
chocolate
lingers
for
some
time
since
i
started
reviewing
this
is
the
first
american
double
stout
and
it
is
definitely
a
little
more
bold
than
a
normal
stout
the
stout
poured
a
nice
thick
dark
dark
brown
in
color
with
no
foam
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
filled
my
nose
but
the
taste
of
all
the
components
in
this
stout
was
great
you
can
taste
the
roasted
malts
that
had
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
not
overly
sweet
and
not
overly
bitter
either
nice
balance
of
all
the
components
when
put
together
a
very
nice
surprise
and
a
wonder
experience
in
a
great
stout
drinkability
the
best
tasting
7
4
stout
i
have
had
cant
believe
its
that
low
in
alcohol
with
all
the
massive
flavors
maybe
the
best
price
for
a
great
beer
i
have
had
as
well
only
3
29
for
a
bomber
of
very
quality
double
stout
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
lush
and
pillowy
giving
purpose
and
life
to
the
oily
flat
slick
to
which
i
erroneously
feared
this
stout
would
succumb
on
the
pour
this
drooped
like
a
dali
pocketwatch
but
in
the
cheeks
and
jowls
it
dances
like
a
rockette
covered
in
caramel
dark
chocolate
coffee
feans
and
whipped
cream
as
it
were
now
theres
a
thought
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
times
over
the
years
it
is
always
an
enjoyable
tipple
i
seem
to
enjoy
it
best
when
sampled
fresh
from
the
brewery
despite
this
being
a
strong
beer
it
does
hold
up
well
in
the
bottle
but
seems
a
touch
to
bitter
and
acidic
from
the
roast
malt
though
only
just
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
breathes
a
bit
it
does
smooth
out
some
it
becomes
more
creamy
with
the
chocolate
smooth
coffee
notes
becoming
more
pronounced
a
rich
dark
spiciness
also
becomes
noticeable
sort
of
reminiscent
of
the
type
of
spices
used
in
a
black
holidaytype
spice
cake
notes
of
vanilla
perhaps
a
hint
of
clove
and
a
wisp
of
nutmeg
all
in
all
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
d
smooth
and
malty
with
alcohol
well
hidden
with
no
cloying
sweetness
or
overly
bitter
flavors
a
good
strong
stout
with
flavor
to
spare
it
tastes
just
great
this
nutty
flowery
slightly
carmely
general
festival
on
the
tounge
i
find
myself
wanting
to
just
suckle
a
mouthfull
until
it
all
slowly
drips
down
the
back
of
my
throat
this
beer
is
a
must
have
especially
if
you
find
it
on
tap
you
will
be
the
envy
of
your
friends
or
you
can
be
the
hero
of
the
day
and
bring
them
a
whole
pitcher
to
share
a
pretty
tasty
stout
and
more
interesting
than
i
expected
ive
never
been
terribly
impressed
with
the
elysian
beers
ive
had
though
not
let
down
by
them
either
this
one
moves
to
the
front
of
their
pack
for
me
with
a
bit
more
body
this
would
be
a
worldbeater
came
in

pint
glass
a
beautiful
deep
opaque
black
with
a
thick
dense
brown
head
and
great
lacing
nose
is
malts
coffee
and
a
small
hint
of
hops
nice
and
toasty
taste
is
roasty
malts
some
smoke
and
slight
alcohol
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
seems
to
improve
upon
warming
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
good
job
elysian
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
nice
robust
body
a
nice
stout
and
one
that
needs
to
be
had
ive
enjoyed
this
brew
i
actually
drank
this
beer
from
the
bottle
while
tailgating
at
quest
field
for
the
seahawks
home
opener
all
i
had
was
plastic
cups
so
after
viewing
the
color
and
getting
a
second
perspective
on
the
nose
i
opted
to
enjoy
the
rest
against
the
glass
it
came
in
the
color
was
a
deep
espresso
hue
with
the
foamy
light
brown
head
that
would
accompany
it
the
nose
had
fantastic
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
and
subtle
coffee
tones
the
taste
was
comparable
milk
chocolate
malts
coffee
fresh
rolled
oats
and
a
finish
of
dark
chocolate
the
mouth
feel
was
velvety
and
rich
probably
due
to
the
rich
oily
texture
that
the
oats
tend
to
lend
to
the
body
of
a
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
with
italian
bread

ricotta
cheese
and
thinly

why
havent
i
tried
this
before
its
terrible
when
we
missout
on
tasty
beers
just
because
they
are
easily
availible
im
kicking
myself
over
this

wow
tasty
and
well
worth
it
starts
thick
thins
by

but
still
a
very
quaffable
brew
if
you
dig
stouts
be
sure
to
sample
one

two
bottles
of
this
goodie
drinkability
well
getting
though
the

was
easy
enough
i
nice
enough
sunday
drinker
but
lets
just
say
im
not
terribly
depressed
that
i
cant
get
this
beer
in
california
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
drinkability
but
there
is
not
much
depth
so
it
gets
a
bit
boring
for
more
than
one
bottle
d
good
drinkability

there
was

over

when
i
poured

and
it
fell
to

over

there
is
just
a
light
carbonation
bubbling
up
in
the
brew
nice
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
very
nice
it
starts
with
a
big
piney
hop
backed
with
chocolate
and
deep
roasted
maltyness
it
comes
together
to
give
hints
of
coffee
as
well
all
the
aromas
are
big
but
in
balance
with
each
other
flavor
is
excellent
the
hop
that
smacked
me
in
the
nose
is
much
more
subdued
the
flavor
is
rich
in
chocolate
moving
to
a
mild
pine
and
roast
character
that
blends
in
with
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
to
finish
with
a
mild
coffee
and
a
nice
moderate
bitterness
i
think
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
excellent
as
nothing
is
out
of
line
or
overly
strong
it
all
meshes
well
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
very
light
carbonation
that
makes
it
fell
nice
and
full
overall
this
one
is
a
very
nice
beer
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
deliver
as
it
warms
the
body
really
bulks
up
to
a
solid
full
feel
giving
me
what
i
had
been
looking
for
for
4
a
bomber
this
is
an
excellent
value
as
far
as
stouts
go
very
nice
a
very
fine
double
stout
that
i
would
recommend
to
all
nwers
and
anyone
visiting
the
area
check
it
out
cheers
beutiful
like
a
stout
should
be
jet
black
body
with
a
huge
chocolate
brown
head
with
huge
fat
bubbles
nose
is
an
invigorating
smokey
malt
that
just
jumps
out
of
the
glass
very
meaty
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
of
this
one
rich
robust
coffee
chocolatey
feel
attacks
the
taste
buds
at
first
sip
eases
up
in
the
middle
and
thins
up
on
the
bitter
that
leads
to
the
finish
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
richness
and
a
bitter
bite
on
the
end
not
to
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
very
relaxed
and
nicely
drinkable
highly
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
this
is
a
smooth
and
rather
mellow
strong
stout
it
may
not
be
the
best
of
elysians
beers
but
its
still
worth
a
look
i
got
a
slight
bit
of
toffee
on
the
first
sip
but
later
in
the
glass
i
am
getting
just
the
light
sweetroasty
flavors
ive
passed
over
various
elysian
brews
at
my
local
grocery
store
for
a
while
now
and
i
thought
id
give
one
of
them
a
go
wise
choice
indeed
the
thick
black
liquid
poured
a
nice
thick
tan
head
and
very
dark
black
not
stone
imp
russian
stout
black
but
black
nonetheless
carbonation
bubbles
clung
to
inside
of
the
glass
and
it
was
overall
a
very
attractive
beer
smells
of
fruits
nuts
and
tones
of
sweetness
caught
my
attention
the
taste
was
excellent
a
hit
of
bitterness
up
front
with
a
lingering
burnt
malt
and
coffee
flavor
a
twinge
of
chocolate
in
there
but
much
less
than
other
porters
ive
had
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
it
got
even
better
as
the
beer
warmed
to
room
temperature
thanks
to
thebungyo
for
the
trade
surprisingly
smooth
and
balanced
stout
neither
on
sweet
nor
bitter
side

not
overally

allowed
my

quite

not

takes
the
drinker
on

journey
of

recommend
to
all
stout

i
expected

fantastic

this

be
considered
a
meal

this
is
a
solid

opinion

it
still
is
not
as
hoppy

me
as
say
the

stout

it
was
better

still
not
better
than
a

detect

this
is
one

a

great

being
an

fan
of

brewing
company
beer
i
had
every
confidence
that
this
would
be
a
humdinger
of
an
american
double
stout
im
still
surprised
however
by
just
how
good
it
is
i
dont
remember
every
detail
and
havent
memorized
the
scores
of
my
favorites
but
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
dragontooth
stands
proudly
among
them
a
big
thanks
to
a
fella
in

named

me
get

there
is
a
bit

smooth

creamy
roundness
from
the
oats
but
this
isnt
your
standard
sweet
stout
its
much
bigger
and
more
bitter

fairly
big
stout

the

with

really
bold

but
for
me
a
little
too
much
emphasis
on
coffee
somewhat
lacking
in
the
other
roasted
flavors
i
enjoy
such
as
chocolates
a
delicious
beer
nonetheless
just
a
little
unbalanced
overall
a
decent
stout
certainly
not
great
but
solid
i
was
planning
on
sampling
a
couple
of
the
nw
beers
on
tap
this
night
but
as
soon
as
i
got
my
lips
on
the
first
pint
i
knew
i
had
found
a
home
for
a
while
and
was
not
going
to
stray
to
any
other
beers
this
is
seriously
tasty
stuff
the
fact
that
its
only
7
4
makes
it
all
the
easier
to
down
in
my
opinion
i
will
definitely
keep
my
eyes
peeled
for
more
of
this
stuff
one
negative

drinkability

this
is
one
of
the
few
good
stouts
that
are
produced
here
in
the
pacnw
the
label
says
that
its
a
winner
of
the
gold
medal
in
2001
2004
at
the
gabf
and
i
certainly
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
claim
d
4
its
strong
and
rich
but
very
enjoyable
this
stout
poured
an
almost
opaque
black
color
with
brown
foam
that
left
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
an
almost
vinous
fruity
quality
the
taste
was
mainly
dark
roasted
malt
and
barley
but
with
some
sweet
oats
and
a
slight
fruitiness
the
hop
bitterness
was
mildly
noticeable
in
the
finish
this
stout
was
smooth
but
a
bit
sharp
on
the
tongue
overall
it
was
tangy
and
malty
with
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
full
with
good
carbonation
this
was
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
stout
this
is
one
of
the
most
raw
stouts
i
have
tasted
in
a
long
time
a
nice
dark
rubybrown
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
very
light
with
some
hint
of
malt
the
primary
governing
characteristic
here
is
the
bitterness
the
bitter
quality
of
teh
stout
while
not
completely
unwelcome
accentuates
the
thin
body
the
malt
presence
isnt
too
bad
but
all
together
not
a
favorite
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
nw
dinner
at
redbones
this
week
solid
black
body
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
lasted
malt
oats
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
are
the
flavors
that
came
through
well
balanced
stout
as
no
one
flavor
pushed
through
this
beer
has
a
higher
abv
so
look
out
this
is
the
second
beer
that
i
have
had
from
elysian
and
i
am
once
again
very
impressed
thick
and
flavourful
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
a
dessert

chocolate
none

not
real
strong

very

nicely

in
flavors
slow
elk
is
a
decent
milkoatmeal
stout
worth
a
try
overall
not
really
one
i
cared
for
all
too
much
it
was
too
sweet
without
enough
roast
and
didnt
really
have
a
great
body
for
the
style
ah
just
ok
slow
elk
is
a
pleasant
oatmeal
stout
which
is
smooth
and
not
astringent
while
it
is
not
as
flavorful
as
some
others
of
the
style
anderson
valleys
come
to
mind
its
a
good
sweeter
alternative
after
drinking
all
those
tongue
buckling
ipas
its
a
very
good
oatmeal
stout
maybe
just
a
tad
to
sweet
in
the
finish
though
i
should
not
take
off
to
much
for
that
cause
many
i
have
had
in
the
style
are
fairly
sweet
a
slightly
fuller
body
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
either
again
not
a
detriment
overall
very
enjoyable
and
will
put
the
six
pack
to
good
use
decent
enough
stuff
i
do
believe
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
trying
the
slow
elk
for
the
first
time
as
a
desert
to
a
long
friday
the
beer
poured
a
black
opaque
with
a
thin
ecru
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
is
has
a
nice
espresso
feel
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
coffee
but
it
is
decent
there
is
a
nice
sweet
toffee
after
taste
which
makes
one
want
to
keep
sipping
away
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
its
a
smooth
drinkable
stout
that
is
worth
a
taste
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
like
most
of
what
the
big
sky
brewery
kicks
out
and
this
is
very
unique
oatmeal
stouts
usually
put
me
to
sleep
with
their
heaviness
but
this
one
keeps
me
awake
and
has
me
reaching
for
another
id
hang
out
with
this
one
once
in
a
while
its
a
session
stout
for
me
o
i
think
this
is
a
solid
oatmeal
stout
that
id
enjoy
drinking
again
great
price
nothing
wowing
about
it
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
think
worth
a
try
cheers
o
a
pleasantly
surprising
brew
that
offers
straightforward
flavors
and
body
but
done
very
well
overall
the
flavor
is
fantastic
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
blend
fantastically
with
the
malt
and
hopsthe
carbonation
makes
a
cotton
candy
like
fluff
that
is
very
flavorfuli
recognize
that
its
an
imperial
stout
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
dominantit
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
and
that
would
create
a
more
balanced
flavorful
beer3
755
o
light
body
for
an
oatmeal
nose
is
pleasant
but
faint
and
would
like
more
complexity
the
aciddry
taste
i
guess
is
from
the
oatmeal
would
like
more
intense
roasted
malt
flavors
it
was
worth
trying
this
brew
but
next
time
i
might
skip
it
to
try
a
different
one
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
at
best
example
of
the
style
the
flavors
were
too
thin
and
the
body
was
too
watery
for
the
style
thats
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
good
oatmeal
stout
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
but
the
flavors
just
couldnt
hold
my
attention
and
the
thin
body
was
a
turn
off
so
one
is
more
then
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
appearance
they
werent
great
but
they
werent
bad
and
either
and
compared
to
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
those
were
the
highlights
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
muted
the
roasted
malt
flavors
were
and
how
thin
and
watery
the
mouthfeel
was
they
were
a
pretty
big
disappointment
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
priced
good
but
the
quality
isnt
up
to
my
standards
for
the
style
and
theres
many
more
oatmeal
stouts
that
i
would
much
rather
be
drinking
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
its
just
not
worth
it
all
in
all
i
was
let
down
with
this
beer
it
just
didnt
deliver
what
a
good
oatmeal
stout
should
and
it
left
me
wanting
much
more
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
turned
out
to
be
a
miss
a
very
mild
mannered
stout
easy
drinking
but
sort
of
boring
overall
drinkable
but
i
have
tried
better
examples
of
this
style
o
a
decent
os
that
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
i
would
have
liked
the
sweet
nose
to
transfer
more
into
the
taste
the
stale
smoke
flavor
almost
overpowered
the
other
flavors
slow
elk
missed
the
mark
for
me
but
wasnt
way
off
a
decent
attempt
but
not
close
to
a
top
lister
by
any
means
i
can
say
its
better
than
many
i
have
had
though
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oats
and
some
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
burnt
and
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
thin
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
has
an
unexciting
flavor
and
mouthfeel
m
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonaiton
too
carbonated
for
the
style
for
my
liking
overall
nothing
spectacular
about
this
stout
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
as
far
as
malt
and
hops
could
definitely
be
more
there
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
though
this
definitely
isnt
rated
high
enough
on
here
its
a
rich
creamy
smooth
stout
with
a
great
oat
flavor
it
pours
midnight
black
and
thick
as
hersheys
syrup
theres
an
aggressive
three
inch
foamy
mocha
head
that
leaves
pretty
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smells
like
milk
chocolate
and
oatmeal
with
brown
sugar
the
beer
isnt
sweet
but
it
is
creamy
seems
like
flavor
elements
of
a
milk
stout
as
well
as
an
outmeal
stout
with
the
roasty
malts
and
chocolate
notes
dominating
the
feel
is
excellent
too
velvety
smooth
and
coats
the
mouth
and
throat
with
a
layer
of
goodness
mellow
carbonation
gives
it
a
nice
rich
feel
one
of
the
better
big
sky
beers
ive
had
and
this
shold
get
much
more
appreciation
on
here
would
make
an
lovely
beer
float
with
some
hard
vanilla
bean
ice
cream
overall
sweet
mother
does
this
not
hit
the
spot
its
like
someone
took
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
cut
it
with
half
water
what
were
they
thinking
i
got
excited
by
the
smell
then
was
completely
let
down
after
the
first
sip
ill
never
buy
this
again
o
a
enjoyable
stout
that
goes
down
easy
nice
offering
from
the
brewer
pours
a
black
color
one
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
slight
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
oatmeal
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
oatmeal
slight
roasted
malt
slight
hops
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
overall
decent
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
no
one
aspect
of
the
beer
is
great
but
still
an
easydrinking
beer
o
nothing
too
interesting
here
too
watery
which
reduces
the
enjoyment
quite
a
bit
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
a
very
roasty
toasty
brew
good
flavors
the
only
complaint
i
see
is
there
needs
to
be
more
oatmeal
most
oatmeal
beer
that
i
drink
are
a
bit
more
complex
tad
creamy
and
smoother
good
beer
nonetheless
overy
good
oatmeal
stout
that
is
well
balnced
12

pours
crystal
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
and
fairly
dense
12
fingers
of
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
lacing
cap
that
lasts
some
fairly
thick
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
chocolate
caramel
roasted

oatmeal
and
bitter
coffee
some
surprisingly
nice
aromas
with
good
strength
taste
of
light
chocolate
oats
caramel
light
coffee
and
roasted

finish
is
fairly
dry
but
there
is
some
light
bitterness
with
lingering
notes
of
roasted

caramel
light
chocolate
and
coffee
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
as
expected
for
a
beer
of

4
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
decently
creamy
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
nice
balance
of
flavors
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
an
average
oatmeal
stout
smells
good
tastes
okay
feels
inadequate
wanted
to
delay
the
mead
a
bit
so
i
went
in
for
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
it
pours
a
very
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
dark
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
barley
as
though
twere
fresh
from
a
grain
bag
light
cocoa
powder
and
very
light
coffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
small
bit
of
char
in
the
background
things
still
taste
kinda
husky
grainwise
rather
than
the
roasted
malted
barley
that
would
normally
be
found
in
these
types
o
brews
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
kinda
weak
stout
one
that
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
poured
this
oatmeal
stout
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
stout
produced
a
tan
head
only
average
retention
it
poured
a
dark
brown
color
left
behind
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
hops
medium
body
smooth
easy
to
drink
tastes
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
just
not
much
to
brag
about
with
this
one
so
far
my
least
favorite
offering
from
big
sky
that
said
this
is
a
party
porter
anybody
can
drink
this
and
beer
snobs
will
approve
i
think
that
is
what
big
sky
had
in
mind
seasonal
beers
often
end
up
at
parties
and
especially
xmas
parties
ftw
good
oat
stout
always
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
great
example
yet
another
solid
brew
from
big
sky
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
and
by
far
the
best
i
have
had
from
big
sky
the
malts
and
roast
on
the
tongue
are
solid
if
a
little
formulaic
but
that
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
and
this
beer
has
a
glorious
feel
that
makes
it
more
than
a
pleasure
to
drink
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
it
does
feel
a
little
light
for
a
stout
but
flavorwise
they
have
done
no
ill
i
taste
coffee
then
chocolate
which
settles
into
an
oatmealy
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
very
pleasant
almost
like
after
downing
a
whole
sheet
of
mothers
fresh
cookies
and
then
lapsing
into
a
comforting
coma
i
am
not
a
regular
oatmeal
stout
drinker
but
id
be
into
trying
more
of
them
after
this
pleasant
experience
drinkability
it
is
a
good
effort
and
i
think
it
is
on
the
path
toward
high
quality
but
i
expected
more
since
it
is
a
limited
release
overall
really
disappointed
as
i
love
all
other
big
sky
brews
this
may
be
their
weakest
effort
and
its
my
favorite
style
just
too
thin
overall
its
your
typical
runofthemill
stout
that
plays
it
safe
and
sticks
to
what
makes
an
oatmeal
stout
drinkable
and
thats
okay
i
wouldve
liked
to
have
a
bit
more
flavor
but
in
the
end
its
a
drinkable
stout
that
manages
to
be
decent
and
at
least
appeasing
overall
a
damn
good
beer
great
coffee
flavor
and
a
very
coating
creamy
mouthfeel
to
boot
i
loved
it
final
notes
this
is
another
one
of
those
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
little
lacking
beers
the
smell
and
taste
it
has
are
good
but
i
just
wish
there
was
more
substance
to
it
it
happens
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
nice
two
finger
head
lacing
and
bubble
action
is
impressive
root
beer
opacity
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
coffee
a
little
light
and
thin
for
the
style
but
very
smooth
im
not
getting
that
bite
that
you
come
to
expect
still
a
decent
offering
just
not
the
best
big
whiff
of
cains
diner
coffee
from
the
outset
leading
into
a
caramel
and
toffee
heavy
body
light
milk
chocolate
and
more
weak
coffee
with
a
dash
of
creamer
a
nice
burst
of
earth
and
meadow
comes
from
the
goldings
while
it
finishes
with
a
subtle
balance
of
fruit
from
the
english
yeast
this
is
a
solid
englishstyle
porter
too
bad
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
any
sort
of
oatmeal
stout
wheres
the
creaminess
another
bag
or
two
of
roasted
malts
and
a
higher
mash
temp
would
go
a
long
way
not
bad
beer
in
the
least
but
it
misses
the
style
mark
completely
im
just
relieved
im
not
relying
on
this
to
get
me
through
a
long
montana
winters
night
i
liked
this
one
i
think
this
big
sky
brewery
is
a
good
one
one
of
the
lighter
oatmeal
stouts
but
when
i
want
oatmeal
i
want
a
lighter
stout
experience
so
this
one
delivered
to
my
expectations
this
is
a
decent
tasting
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
is
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
but
for
me
this
style
is
all
about
mouthfeel
and
in
that
aspect
this
does
not
really
deliver
drinks
easy
enough
but
was
hoping
for
so
much
more
from
big
sky
glad
i
didnt
by
a
sixer
of
this
the
only
thing
about
this
beer
that
really
blows
my
mind
is
how
much
it
reminds
me
of
the
results
of
an
extract
homebrew
recipe
after
brewing
it
in
2009
my
partner
in
crime
goblinmunkey7
here
on
ba
and
i
agreed
that
it
was
too
thin
and
decided
to
describe
it
as
a
dark
ale
however
after
sitting
for
a
few
months
it
became
great
i
wonder
if
this
gets
better
over
time
too
notes
average
oatmeal
stout
it
wasnt
great
and
there
was
a
subtle
astringency
that
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
flavors
arent
horrible
but
they
just
didnt
quite
mesh
entirely
i
would
call
this
a
good
run
of
the
mill
oatmeal
stout
it
doesnt
wow
or
really
stand
out
but
it
is
enjoyable
and
well
done
i
will
certainly
have
no
problem
finishing
this
off
in
short
time
o
it
is
an
ok
beer
not
upset
i
drank
it
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
again
overall
i
would
give
this
to
a
breastfeeding
mother
on
any
occasion
o
meh
not
at
all
impressive
for
the
style
o
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
easygoing
and
smooth
tried
it
at
a
tasting
last
week
and
happy
to
have
a
sixer
and
a
real
review
will
look
forward
to
it
returning
next
year
o
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
a
little
watered
down
but
some
fantastic
smell
overall
this
is
a
pretty
unremarkable
beer
its
not
bad
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
o
underimpressed
big
sky
usually
makes
a
good
push
with
their
brews
slow
elk
is
on
the
weaker
side
of
things
i
guess
its
a
good
thing
that
its
a
limited
release
o
this
is
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
the
label
itself
is
worth
picking
one
up
o
a
good
oatmeal
stout
light
on
the
body
but
not
on
flavors
starts
off
kind
of
light
but
hits
its
stride
with
notes
of
sugar
molasses
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
that
carry
over
well
in
the
flavor
smooth
with
loads
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
and
mellow
balance
between
the
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
easily
drinkable
and
a
nice
and
solid
beer
oa
decent
beer
that
i
got
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
an
ok
tan
head
nose
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
slight
roasted
chocolate
malts
finishes
with
a
small
slightly
dry
hop
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
but
is
thin
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
with
decent
flavor
but
no
overly
exciting
qualities
glad
to
have
tried
and
will
have
to
find
a
fresh
version
for
next
time
a
very
quaffable
oatmeal
stout
and
for
me
that
is
the
problem
i
like
to
sip
my
oatmeal
stouts
and
to
me
this
is
right
between
and
american
stout
and
a
traditional
outmeal
stout
some
more
hops
would
have
been
good
to
make
it
american
and
more
body
for
an
oatmeal
but
hey
not
terrible
i
just
wouldnt
guess
is
was
an
oatmeal
stout
in
a
blind
test
but
who
am
i
right
sessionable
but
not
particularly
impressive
flavorwise
not
big
skys
shining
moment
i
imagine
overall
its
enjoyable
but
in
such
a
solid
category
and
considering
other
great
offerings
from
big
sky
id
probably
get
something
else
first
drinkability
fairly
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
oatmeal
stout
taste
is
a
little
bit
off
for
my
liking
but
would
recommend
to
those
macrodrinking
friends
looking
to
try
something
different
an
easydrinking
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
porters
that
were
more
robust
oatmeal
porter
maybe
even
then
thin
inoffensive
a
light
oatmeal
stout
and
not
bad
for
that
without
categorizing
it
its
a
solid
b
simple
but
good
however
taking
style
into
account
it
suffers
conclusion
good
beer
awesome
packaging
just
not
really
right
for
the
style
slap
nut
brown
on
the
label
and
id
even
pay
the
8
49
to
pick
it
up
again
very
easy
to
drink
wish
i
had
bought
a
6
of
these
instead
of
a
single
bottle
d
its
drinkable
and
because
its
light
you
can
have
a
couple
but
there
is
something
funky
just
slightly
that
makes
you
not
want
to
go
crazy
with
it
this
really
doesnt
feel
like
an
oatmeal
stout
and
the
more
i
have
of
it
the
worse
it
tastes
drinkability
this
is
not
a
very
good
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
at
all
so
it
isnt
all
that
drinkable
for
me
i
think
the
recipe
for
this
needs
some
serious
work
d
lighter
abv
and
drinkable
but
needs
more
of
the
oatmeal
taste
a
little
too
much
of
the
malts
dfairly
drinkable
a
standard
brew
displaying
the
characteristics
of
the
style
quality
above
average
very
drinkable
this
was
an
easy
drinking
simple
oatmeal
stout
to
me
if
the
aroma
was
beefed
up
a
bit
this
would
be
a
top
notch
oatmeal
stout
and
its
still
quite
nice
as
it
stands
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
tan
head
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
very
nice
toffeechocolate
notes
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
very
nice
toffeechocolate
notes
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
wish
we
would
get
it
here
in
utah
it
took
some
work
but
i
finally
got
the
seal
off
the
bottom
of
the
cap
so
i
could
read
what
was
printed
there
and
the
answer
is
nuttier
than
a
squirrel
turd
pours
very
dark
almost
completely
black
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
i
smell
coffee
mocha
and
something
reminiscent
popcorn
nice
dark
malt
flavor
of
chocolate
and
coffee
some
graininess
and
a
burnt
taste
is
noted
on
the
finish
not
the
biggest
body
for
a
stout
but
still
maintains
a
nice
texture
a
nice
approachable
dark
beer
for
people
that
do
not
want
to
jump
in
the
deep
end
of
the
pool
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
would
be
possible
very
good
drinkability
as
this
brew
chose
the
approachable
versus
the
challenging
path
a
tasty
enough
example
of
the
style
and
something
that
would
be
easy
enough
to
knock
back
all
night
long
and
at
5
4abv
this
would
certainly
be
considered
a
sessionable
brew
here
in
na
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
and
may
be
a
good
choice
for
those
interested
in
tackling
the
darker
more
roasted
styles
da
decent
brew
that
might
veer
more
towards
the
porter
side
of
the
world
as
an
os
it
is
lacking
but
is
a
decent
brew
otherwise
poured
a
deep
garnet
color
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
the
residual
lace
fine
sheets
smell
is
lightly
toasted
grain
aroma
with
sweet
candy
like
tones
and
is
quite
pleasant
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
top
middling
pretty
good
brew
in
my
opinion
pours
a
deep
deep
ruby
with
mocha
brown
head
had
a
six
pack
and
i
think
everyone
had
different
head
some
had
a
nice
thick
one
others
it
was
very
thin
and
nonexistant
smell
was
enjoyable
its
was
a
nice
mix
of
chocolate
syrup
with
some
dark
caramel
and
a
bit
of
cream
to
it
taste
was
ok
but
a
little
bland
this
as
with
many
stouts
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
at
a
warmer
temperature
at
first
the
taste
is
very
bland
however
as
it
hits
the
back
of
the
tounge
you
notice
some
milk
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
with
some
bakers
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
far
to
light
and
watery
for
me
i
think
if
this
beer
had
a
fuller
body
id
be
a
good
b
brew
overall
good
and
pretty
easy
to
put
a
few
away
in
a
sitting
clear
garnet
body
thin
and
bubbly
light
brown
crown
lacing
is
plenty
sufficient
decent
aroma
of
oats
cocoa
milk
sugar
and
smoke
lactose
and
milk
chocolate
are
the
presiding
characteristics
on
the
palate
this
definitely
has
some
milk
stout
qualities
to
it
the
oatmeal
is
noticeable
however
in
the
taste
and
in
the
mouthfeel
which
is
smooth
and
velvety
roasted
malts
add
a
little
depth
but
the
charm
with
this
beer
is
in
its
simplicity
good
beer
drinkability
pass
errs
on
the
side
of
drinkable
but
ultimately
its
a
bit
thin
and
leaves
you
or
me
at
least
looking
and
wanting
for
more
richness
more
creaminess
is
this
an
oatmeal
stout
lite
d
compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
this
is
below
average
but
thats
not
to
say
this
isnt
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
overall
impression
drinkable
a
bit
lighter
than
most
oatmeal
stouts
doesnt
have
the
slick
mouthfeel
i
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
edit
i
am
totally
perplexed
by
the
animal
on
the
logo
its
a
cow
with
elk
antlers
perhaps
after
a
few
beers
you
actually
understand
it
i
may
never
know
drinkability
is
ok
a
pretty
tasty
stout
that
could
use
a
little
work
with
the
mouthfeel
i
still
wont
be
upset
drinking
a
couple
of
these
from
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
clear
root
beer
color
with
small
quickly
dissipating
head
below
average
carbonation
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
some
oats
first
sip
is
smooth
with
roasted
malts
leading
the
way
there
is
a
fairly
weak
malt
backbone
very
nice
and
drinkable
excellent
bitter
finish
overall
a
solid
and
tasty
stout
a
little
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
go
ahead
and
skip
this
if
there
is
oats
in
here
they
sure
skimped
on
them
volume
appears
to
be
the
priority
d
not
hard
to
drink
the
beer
is
not
weighty
by
its
carbonation
or
its
thickness
the
abv
im
sure
is
higher
than
normal
but
so
far
has
not
affected
me
edit
i
was
reading
the
other
reviews
and
realized
that
my
rating
was
a
lot
higher
than
average
and
also
that
im
the
only
one
thats
reviewed
it
this
year
the
bottle
does
say
limited
release
on
it
so
either
my
taste
buds
are
pretty
different
from
average
or
this
beer
has
improved
i
say
if
youve
had
this
in
the
past
try
it
again
and
if
you
havent
had
it
before
dont
let
the
average
c
rating
scare
you
off
its
a
pretty
good
stout
drinkability

this
went
down
very
well
so
im
giving
the
highest
rating
of
the
beer
in
this
category
i
could
drink
this
all
day
really
as
a
session
ale
but
its
just
not
what
i
expect
when
i
buy
an
oatmeal
stout
a
very
accessible
and
tame
brew
for
the
stout
novice
but
lacking
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
residual
sugars
of
a
typical
oatmeal
stout
black
color
large
head
roasted

chocolaty

roasted

i
kept
waiting
for
this
beer
to
show
me
something
more
a
rough
pour
delivers
a
bigbubbled
and
frothy
lighttan
head
that
holds
well
over
a
very
deep
almost
black
mahoganybrown
body
that
displays
clear
crimson
highlights
at
the
base
of
the
glass
when
held
to
the
light
light
cocoa
some
milk
chocolate
a
touch
of
lightly
roasted
coffee
and
some
background
floral
hops
appear
in
the
nose
its
creamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
delicate
carbonation
that
accentuates
its
mediumlight
body
theres
more
coffee
and
a
much
darker
chocolate
present
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
suggests
and
some
light
fruit
also
comes
into
play
it
remains
sweetish
with
an
underlying
bitterness
but
some
mild
acidity
from
the
dark
malts
helps
to
round
things
out
it
finishes
with
a
gently
lingering
note
of
mocha
and
a
dull
mild
bitterness
its
not
overly
impressive
flavorwise
but
it
is
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
at
least
once
this
beer
started
off
good
but
limped
home
in
the
end
a
bit
of
work
and
this
could
be
a
good
brew

the
lightest
oatmeal
stout
i
have
ever
run
into
a
good
drinking
ale
but
there
is
nothing
special
that
it
brings
to
the
table
lacking
is
the
roasty
flavor
on
the
palate
that
i
utterly
insist
on
in
an
oatmeal
stout
not
much
bite
and
far
too
light
in
body
a
decent
and
drinkable
stout
but
on
the
bottom
rung
as
oatmeals
go
rich
black
color
with
some
dark
ruby
highlights
with
a
tannish
small
bubbly
head
that
fizzes
away
quick
smells
of
oats
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
burnt
cookie
caramel
notes
the
taste
was
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
stout
that
looked
so
dark
but
is
pretty
good
non
the
less
lots
of
solid
oats
slight
caramel
roasted
malts
and
some
slightly
burnt
chocolate
tones
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
with
a
sweet
tang
caused
by
the
chocolate
and
from
a
very
small
hop
presence
this
stuff
aint
bad
i
actually
liked
it
alot
and
would
drink
it
any
old
time
i
love
the
label
the
cow
with
the
elk
antlers
kinda
funny
reminds
me
alot
of
anderson
valley
labels
bears
with
antlers
hmmm
i
wonder
deep
dark
brown
in
hue
black
in
the
middle
with
a
hint
of
red
highlights
when
held
to
a
light
a
tan
head
of
a
babys
finger
in
height
quickly
dissipated
to
a
bubbly
collar
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
of
note
minimal
potency
in
the
nose
sweet
oatmeal
is
the
most
prominent
flavorful
palate
but
the
sweet
oatmeal
doesnt
mix
so
well
with
the
roasted
malt
and
the
insignificant
chocolate
notes
the
bitterness
doesnt
complement
the
sweetness
frankly
they
clash
seemed
a
little
off
the
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
only
compounds
the
problem
awful
clean
on
all
accounts
lousy
finish
the
more
your
drink
slow
elk
the
less
impressed
you
become
not
worth
trying
below
average
slow
elk
eh
this
is
one
slow
stout
it
pours
out
a
blackruby
hue
really
fizzy
head
that
died
quickly
no
lace
slight
burnt
malt
aroma
some
cocoa
notes
tastes
mostly
of
some
chocolate
malts
and
oatmeal
overtones
this
beer
seemed
so
dead
that
i
busted
out
the
valentines
chocolates
to
help
things
out
too
smooth
and
dead
mouthfeel
a
really
disappointing
end
to
this
brew
weak
and
seemingly
watery
munching
hershey
kisses
while
drinking
this
brew
didnt
seem
to
help
a
bad
example
of
any
stout
not
recommended
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
head
is
light
brown
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
the
roast
malt
aroma
is
surprisingly
light
also
in
the
aroma
is
a
malt
sweetness
and
a
toasted
graininess
the
flavor
again
is
light
in
the
roast
malt
department
but
it
has
a
sweet
chocolatey
flavor
the
bitterness
is
evident
but
subdued
the
texture
is
somewhat
smooth
and
creamy
but
it
does
have
a
carbonic
tinge
to
it
overall
not
bad
but
lacking
the
roast
malt
aromas
and
flavors
i
would
expect
the
beer
pours
a
deep
garnet
color
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
the
residual
lace
fine
sheets
nose
has
a
lightly
toasted
grain
aroma
with
sweet
candy
like
tones
and
is
quite
pleasant
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
top
middling
finish
is
pertinently
hopped
and
the
carbonation
moderate
the
aftertaste
chocolate
dry
drinkable
but
not
a
great
beer
just
average
i
guess
or
better
yet
beginners
stout
best
describes
it
this
oatmeal
stout
is
a
clean
quality
brew
from
big
sky
the
body
is
not
too
heavy
like
most
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
tried
but
that
does
not
affect
the
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
possesses
just
a
bit
of
roasted
flavor
finish
off
a
nice
tasting
donation
to
the
craft
a
dark
stout
with
a
brief
head
low
carbonation
good
oatmeal
flavor
with
some
malty
overtones
giving
a
slight

not
quite
black
with
reddish
hues
poking
through
thin
tan
head
that
disappears
and
leaves
no
trace
of
its
existence
mild

aromas
with
pleasant
hints
of
fruity
esters
flavors
are
subdued
for
an
oatmeal
stout
and
theres
minimal
oaty
existence
no
viscosity
i
thought
it
would
improve
as
it
warmed
but
it
didnt
the
fruit
flavors
seem
out
of
place
with
so
many
top
notch
competitors
in
its
class
it
didnt
impress

nondescript
caramel
malt
sweetness
along
w
slightly
tart
esters
not
particularly
eniticing
aromawise
thin
in
body
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
lacks
the
viscous
proteinaceous
quality
that
a
good
oatmeal
stout
should
have
the
contribution
from
the
oats
is
imperceptible
nothing
outsatnding
in
this
brew
the
slightly
bitter
generic
roasted
grain
notes
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
comprise
the
malt
profile
slow
elk
is
quite
bland
all
around
for
style
and
is
a
weak
and
ummemorable
oatmeal
stout
no
outright
flaws
here
however
dark
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
medium
brown
head
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
present
but
subdued
burnt
character
is
there
but
hard
to
find
sweet
dry
finish
i
think
this
may
be
a
decent
beer
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
as
its
flavor
profile
and
is
not
overly
strong
but
it
still
has
all
the
characteristics
albeit
subdued
sweet
stout
is
one
thing
but
this
brew
never
generated
any
flavor
at
any
temperature
blandly
sweet
less
than
average
mouthfeel
for
the
style
i
was
pretty
bummed
by
slow
elk
little
aroma
watery
little
head
more
of
a
brown
ale
easy
drinking
some
sweetness
on
aftertaste
below

to
average
stout
give
this
one
to
people
who
are
afraid
of
big
bad
dark
stouts
doesnt
taste
very
dark
or
much
like
a
stout
to
be
fair
this
one
followed
the
bells
oatmeal
stout
in
my
tasting
and
didnt
come
close
to
measuring
up
in
character
or
taste
feel
well
chosen
low
carbonation
mediumfull
bodied
nicely
smooth
a
pretty
decent
stout
okay
flavor
but
not
fantastic
there
are
better
oatmeal
stouts
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
charcoal
somewhat
meaty
brewed
with
oatmeal
but
not
nearly
as
smooth
as
some
of
the
more
famed
versions
of
the
style
thin
boring
not
really
flavorful
roasted
malt
faint
hops
bit
of
coffee
thin
over
force
carbonated
mouthfeel
most
american
breweries
take
on
this
style
and
are
much
more
inspired
sub
par
overall
given
the
fact
that
blue
point
is
a
great
brewery
this
is
an
astonishing
dud
very
enjoyable
beer
when
this
brew
arrived
very
little
head
was
left
not
sure
if
it
dwindled
down
before
arrival
or
what
loved
the
nose
nice
chocolates
coffee
roasted
complimented
this
brew
with
some
red
velvet
cake
went
very
well
the
decadent
notes
in
the
beer
with
the
decadent
flavors
of
the
cake
are
hard
to
beat
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
definitely
something
i
would
drink
again
well
this
is
a
weird
beer
it
looks
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
great
the
aroma
is
solid
if
perhaps
a
touch
overroasted
but
theres
something
just
a
little
bit
off
on
the
taste
if
i
knew
more
about
how
to
catch
beers
with
infections
that
havent
fully
taken
over
yet
i
might
be
able
to
describe
it
better
because
i
have
a
sneaky
feeling
thats
whats
going
on
here
theres
a
tart
slightly
fruity
flavor
in
the
back
that
really
doesnt
fit
the
beers
flavor
profile
its
too
bad
because
this
would
be
a
tasty
one
otherwise
its
an
easy
drinker
abv
is
only
moderate
at
best
theres
no
alcohol
or
hop
presence
it
looks
and
smells
pretty
good
but
it
tastes
and
feels
more
like
a
water
down
soft
drink
this
wasnt
very
good
strong
aroma
has
firm
tones
of
roast
coffee
semisweet
chocolate
and
molasses
plus
a
hint
of
honey
it
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
or
repulsive
pours
a
deep
sable
just
a
whisker
or
two
above
black
with
a
thick
fluffy
and
rather
persistent
light
tan
head
flavor
unfortunately
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
very
tempting
aroma
it
has
the
mocha
and
molasses
tones
that
the
aroma
promised
but
these
are
on
the
wan
and
watery
side
texture
has
watery
body
and
not
much
fizz
finish
is
smoky
with
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
ok
not
great
but
worthy
of
at
least
a
try
o
one
of
me
favorites
from
blue
point
wish
this
was
in
a
6
pack
overall
a
dissapointment
there
are
way
too
many
good
stouts
around
for
me
to
ever
revisit
this
22
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no

dating
pours
crystal
clear
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
fairly
dense
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers

soapy
lacing

down
the
glass

for
a

no

at

with
a
fairly
creamy
and
lightly
chalky
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nose
there
were
nice
fruity
and
buttery
inclusions
adding
a
big
degree
of
depth
and
surprising
layer
of
complexity
the
flavoring
showed
equally
as
robust
qualities
with
that
huge
vanilla
off
the
bat
this
both
added
to
and
helped
to
cut
the
sweetness
in
the
end
the
balance
was
set
by
the
malty
tone
and
the
beer
is
fun
to
drink
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
the
beer
looks
great
and
smells
awesome
full
of
coffee
roasted
notes
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
okay
though
a
bit
weak
and
the
body
is
a
little
too
thin
not
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
or
bp
beer
but
worth
checking
out
o
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
its
about
time
i
rate
it
o
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
lighter
body
and
lower
abv
this
beer
is
pretty
close
to
being
sessionable
and
is
a
great
value
beer

overall
i
have
and
you
have
had
better
oatmeal
stouts
granted
for
the
price
it
does
the
job
not
meant
to
wow
it
just
enough
salud
easy
drinking
for
a
chewy
beer
this
was
above
average
and
more
flavorful
than
a
standard
guinness
definitely
worth
trying
the
low
abv
makes
it
quite
sessionable
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
oatmeal
stouts
but
i
like
mine
a
touch
sweeter
exceptional
session
ability
since
it
went
down
smooth
even
when
it
was
room
temperature
sipped
on
it
for
over
an
hour
the
stout
poured
a
magnificent
dark
brown
with
a
fine
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
rich
toasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
medium
smooth
and
dry
a
very
nice
entry
smooth
and
toasty
this
is
stout
you
could
sip
on
all
night
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
medium
body
and
medium
effervescence
a
decent
brew
but
just
middle
of
the
pack
for
style
no
sweetness
to
speak
of
either
so
nothing
special
here
overall
decent
beer
overall
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
what
i
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
underwhelming
its
true
to
style
but
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
for
me
o
pretty
decent
stout
aroma
and
taste
were
weaker
then
expected
but
still
its
tasty
would
love
to
see
a
more
aggressive
version
of
this
this
beer
is
poured
out
a
little
thinner
looking
than
i
expected
the
color
of
the
beer
was
a
dark
brown
and
doesnt
look
too
much
like
a
stout
to
me
the
head
was
thin
and
basically
vanished
into
nothing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
roasted
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
toasted
and
a
little
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
in
my
opinion
overall
i
wasnt
super
thrilled
with
this
beer
i
might
try
it
again
but
not
if
its
from
a
cask
not
a
flavorful
stout
however
it
does
provide
a
roasty
brew
with
low
abv
which
is
rare
a
couple
of
notches
above
your
standard
guiness
not
foreign
export
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
coffee
or
a
chocolate
stout
on
the
thinner
side
borderline
watery
very
easy
to
drink
though
a
warm
weather
stout
swung
by
the
brewery
after
work
to
check
things
out
and
it
was
hopping
beer
was
a
deep
watery
black
with
off
white
bubbling
smells
great
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
tastes
just
as
nice
but
the
flavor
has
a
lot
more
roasted
character
to
ot
this
is
a
really
tasty
oatmeal
stout
with
a
great
body
and
fantastic
drinkability
almost
like
an
oatmeal
stout
crossed
with
a
porter
from
the
watery
porter
tingle
pretty
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
looks
decent
black
body
with
big
brown
head
but
dissipates
fast
the
smell
is
weak
but
but
chocolate
and
roasted
aromas
can
be
picked
out
here
and
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
very
thin
maybe
they
should
just
multiply
the
recipe
by
1
5
because
it
just
seems
all
around
weak
o
there
is
a
pretty
good
stout
here
but
the
cask
hinders
this
one
i
suspect
just
ok
c
b
d
fine
for
a
meal
or
by
itself
easy
to
drink
aside
from
a
little
too
much
carbonation
reasonable
abv
for
style
palate
is
light
on
body
but
with
too
high
of
carbonation
still
drinkable
enough
for
me
to
order
another
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
its
nothing
special
so
i
wouldnt
bother
seeking
it
out
but
if
its
on
tap
id
give
it
a
go
i
was
honestly
a
little
disappointed
with
it
because
i
had
tried
a
few
stouts
at
the
brewery
forget
which
and
liked
them
maybe
its
just
because
ive
been
drinking
lots
of
doubles
lately
but
it
was
thin
on
flavor
cheers
draft
at
prime
16
very
watery
black
with
some
head
and
lace
water
tasted
clorine
not
working
some
chocolate
maltmalting
and
some
roast
but
not
really
a
sweet
stout
style
fairly
weak
for
the
style
i
could
use
this
for
cooking
however
passable
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
packs
in
a
lot
of
flavor
without
seeming
to
be
very
filling
which
makes
this
one
sessionable
the
key
word
with
this
beer
is
light
everything
about
this
beer
is
light
sure
the
coffee
smell
was
nice
but
i
really
wanted
a
thick
and
creamy
stout
not
a
dark
light
beer
i
cant
say
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
anywhere
on
cask
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
for
6
it
went
great
with
the
cahill
porter
cheddar
on
the
cheese
plate
the
body
was
light
and
very
drinkable
id
certainly
have
ordered
more
if
the
night
had
allowed
the
flavor
has
a
mix
of
bakers
chocolate
slightly
sour
roasted
coffee
and
that
smooth
oatmeal
cookie
taste
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
enjoyable
stout
another
welcomed
discovery
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
this
beauty
poured
into
a
pint
glass
is
a
dark
opaque
black
with
a
fair
oatmeal
colored
head
and
beautiful
lacing
the
aroma
brings
mild
charcoal
and
some
wheat
hints
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
stronger
charcoal
and
a
very
nice
herbal
hop
medium
plus
body
with
a
dry
finish
that
also
brings
some
chocolate
touches
very
nice
and
plenty
drinkable
for
the
style
d
its
so
weak
and
light
itll
go
down
fast
but
im
not
looking
for
a
stout
to
chug
if
you
want
to
fill
up
your
beer
pong
cups
with
a
stout
use
this
one
if
you
want
something
with
any
character
at
all
avoid
this
one
md
given
the
dominance
of
the
smoke
by
the
end
it
felt
like
drinking
toasted
gasoline
i
couldnt
finish
the
pint
and
i
always
finish
my
pints
it
was
a
beer
that
started
off
well
and
just
fell
apart
completely
in
all
aspects
great
choice
had
this
on
cask
at
pizza
plant
poured
black
with
a
dense
creamy
tan
head
roasted
aroma
and
taste
to
match
with
subtle
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
as
well
and
a
dry
roasty
finish
very
creamy
if
i
hadnt
seen
it
come
out
of
the
beer
engine
i
may
almost
have
thought
that
this
was
nitrotap
quite
drinkable

d
i
have
had
this
many
times
and
it
really
is
a
great
beer
on
cask
on
tap
it
is
ok
but
on
cask
it
shines
this
is
a
really
good
session
beer
for
the
colder
months
well
done
blue
point
really
simple
really
good
overall
quite
impressive
this
oatmeal
stout
has
the
sweet
creaminess
and
the
silky
texture
of
a
good
oatmeal
stout
definitely
one
of
the
better
o
stouts
out
there
i
highly
recommend
it
if
youre
around
the
ny
area
and
can
get
your
hands
on
one
of
these
beauties
d
very
easy
drinking
brew
low
abv
makes
it
even
easier
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
one
was
on
cask
the
body
was
light
and
nutty
with
roasted
malts
towards
the
end
the
mouthfeel
stayed
very
light
a
smooth
for
the
whole
drink
the
smell
was
full
rich
and
nice
and
the
drinkability
was
pretty
good
as
well
as
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
light
bodied
and
pleasant
i
like
this
beer
cask
the
best
so
far
hope
to
have
it
again
drinkability
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
meal
but
average
overall
a
little
smokey
compared
to
others
ive
enjoyed
thick
creamy
three
finger
head
with
an
dark
tan
hue
when
jess
pours
it
from
the
cask
into
the
plastic
blue
point
pint
cups
in
the
tasteing
room
at
the
brewery
a
soft
toasty
stout
aroma
with
detectable
undertones
of
coffee
creamy
and
crisp
taste
fadeing
to
a
faint
coffee
flavor
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
thats
got
something
to
do
with
the
use
of
oats
light
crisp
and
silky
body
with
cask
creamy
carbonation
delicious
beer
greatness
not
too
complex
fairly
average
all
around
d
this
had
pretty
good
drinkability
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
blue
point
has
to
offer
and
on
cask
its
even
better
if
you
can
find
it
certainly
try
it
beef
notes
i
love
me
some
oatmeal
stout
and
this
one
is
a
home
run
the
perfect
dessert
or
even
breakfast
beer
it
definitely
gives
heart
of
darkness
a
run
for
its
money
i
just
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
around
here
brew
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easy
just
a
little
filling
this
one
borders
on
being
a
coffee
porter
which
i
like
a
good
twist
on
the
oatmeal
stout
style
i
liked
this
beer
but
id
just
like
to
see
a
little
bit
more
of
a
kick
to
it
easy
to
consume
with
the
abv
less
than
5
at
8
for
a
refill
id
be
all
over
this
one
time
and
time
again
because
it
is
not
as
sweet
its
drinkability
is
very
high
just
an
all
around
great
oatmeal
stout
to
be
had
here
couple
this
with
the
blueberry
ale
to
make
a
great
black
blue
mmm
appears
with
a
dark
cola
ruby
brown
body
its
dark
when
not
held
to
the
light
and
it
forms
a
moccha
tan
head
leaves
behind
fine
lacing
after
dwindling
slowly
aromatics
have
dominant
dark
roasted
malt
features
like
mild
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
semi
soft
oatmeal
grains
as
well
not
bad
flavor
has
powdered
cocoa
notes
and
a
blend
of
leafy
hop
flavors
hitting
the
palate
as
it
warms
a
bit
more
oats
come
across
with
a
soft
smooth
mineral
character
dark
roasts
provide
a
mild
bitterness
with
more
dark
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
not
as
sweet
as
some
oatmeal
stouts
out
there
but
this
one
does
a
good
job
of
supporting
the
other
two
solid
blue
point
brews
ive
tasted
thus
far
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
even
carbonation
very
smooth
but
i
like
more
fluffy
character
and
a
bit
more
overall
body
from
my
oatmeal
stous
references
to
compare
would
be
like
wild
gooses
mcclausens
or
troegs
versions
drinkability
is
definitely
not
an
issue
here
great
example
of
a
classic
style
just
so
many
beers
to
choose
from
out
there
im
sure
i
will
revisit
this
offering
try
it
if
you
find
it
draft
only
in
the
burgh
a
good
drinkable
stout
a
nice
american
adaptation
of
the
style
im
a
big
oatmeal
stout
fan
so
i
knew
i
would
like
it
before
i
even
tried
it
that
being
said
i
would
say
this
is
middleoftheroad
for
a
beer
of
this
type
its
no
samuel
smith
but
worth
the
cash
all
the
same
a
standard
of
mine
at
the
bar
as
it
is
reliable
and
delicious
on
cask
at
the
pizza
plantpoured
a
near
opaque
black
with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
in
the
body
with
a
creamy
mocha
colored
top
that
stuck
around
till
i
finished
my
pint
unsweetened
chocolate
and
earth
dominated
the
aromasnot
very
sweet
at
all
flavor
wise
unsweetened
chocolate
and
earth
dominated
the
flavors
almost
like
a
dry
stout
body
was
a
tad
thin
but
it
lent
to
its
drinkability
as
it
went
down
easily
one
of
the
few
stouts
i
have
had
on
caska
flavorful
if
no
frills
oatmeal
stout
had
this
on
tap
while
at
david
copperfields
the
other
night
brew
was
poured
to
a
opaque
black
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
had
fantastic
retention
and
left
chunky
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
also
fantastic
with
strong
notes
of
chocolate
malt
nice
roasted
scents
mixed
with
a
pleasant
oat
smell
the
taste
is
very
good
a
little
harsh
with
a
burnt
flavor
at
the
start
but
breaks
away
to
a
smooth
creaminess
of
caramel
and
oat
flavors
does
have
a
hop
characteristic
and
is
noticeable
but
plays
nice
over
all
this
is
a
fine
brew
what
i
feel
a
oatmeal
stout
should
be
like
characteristics
lend
it
to
a
great
seasonal
colder
months
session
brew
if
you
can
give
it
a
try
i
dont
think
you
will
be
upset
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dak
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
dry
oatmeal
scent
along
with
loads
of
black
patent
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
blackchocolate
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
an
oatmeal
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
it
has
good
flavor
and
a
kick
ass
aroma
a
good
drinker
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
for
stout
fans
very
solid
across
the
board
sweet
tasting
with
a
dry
finish
definite
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
burst
of
sweetness
towards
the
end
dry
finish
not
as
thick
as
other
stouts
but
very
rich
and
satisfying
d
a
tasty
stout
to
be
sure
but
gets
a
little
trying
towards
the
end
probably
because
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
still
i
would
get
it
again
so
i
guess
that
says
something
had
on
tap
at
some
bar
in
nyc
all
i
know
is
it
is
less
than
5
minutes
from
cbgbs
we
just
stopped
in
for
a
quick
one
deep
dark
chocolate
brwon
frothy
tan
head
aroam
was
the
expected
roastyness
with
an
additional
tangy
quality
as
well
malty
a
pinch
dry
the
citrusy
finish
was
unexpected
as
well
in
the
past
i
had
only
tried
one
other
oatmeal
stout
made
by
british
superpower
samuel
smith
bluepoint
certainly
got
something
good
here
if
you
are
into
dark
beers
this
is
a
must
try
the
beer
is
very
dark
yet
not
full
of
the
burnt
flavor
other
dark
beers
posses
i
have
tried
on
many
occasions
to
drink
this
all
night
the
only
problem
is
i
get
full
first
so
i
generally
brink
a
growler
to
an
occasion
let
a
couple
people
try
an
oatmeal
beer
but
i
hate
oatmeal
well
so
do
i
but
the
beer
is
a
classic
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
ale
with
a
light
brown
head
that
was
quick
to
leave
big
roasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
starts
out
with
that
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
finishes
smoothly
with
those
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
marleous
robust
mouthfeel
but
maybe
too
much
for
multipile
drinks
it
has
nice
tiny
creamy
bubbles
but
i
cant
say
it
tastes
all
that
distinctive
dark
malt
bit
of
wine
in
the
finish
like
sherry
or
port
not
particularly
oatmealy
a
decent
stout
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
think
its
like
guinness
without
the
nitro
its
a
bit
sour
a
bit
metallic
a
bit
sweet
but
nothing
much
of
anything

ones

also

at
a
local
beverage
store
considering
i
live
only
15
minutes
away
from
the
brewery
a
very
darkblack
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissapears
by
the
time
you
have
imbibed
half
the
glass
a
very
appealing
smell
sort
of
a
sweet
aroma
very
fresh
to
say
the
least
as
for
the
taste
this
is
a
rich
sweet
oatmeal
stout
with
nice
mellowness
to
it
its
maltiness
hit
hard
in
the
beginning
but
my
palate
became
used
to
it
so
i
did
not
perceive
this
beer
as
too
sweet
i
also
do
not
think
this
beer
is
as
heavy
as
other
oatmeal
stouts
which
is
a
nice
balance
i
felt
i
could
have
had
more
of
them
which
is
always
a
good
sign
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
nearly
black
topped
with
a
decent
lasting
head
smells
heavily
of
roasted
coffee
which
is
immediately
apparent
in
the
taste
as
well
along
with
a
bit
of
oatmeal
and
sloght
chocolate
sweetness
very
bold
and
hearty
but
rather
smooth
at
the
same
time
not
what
i
expected
but
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
im
happy
that
for
the
time
that
im
stuck
on
the
island
theres
at
least
one
local
brewery
producing
decent
beers
i
thought
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
one
pours
a
light
brown
thick
choppy
head
it
sort
of
looks
like
seafoam
but
in
a
nice
sort
of
way
head
remains
and
coats
the
glass
down
as
the
beer
empties
smells
a
little
sweet
somewhat
fruity
tastes
light
with
subtle
flavors
making
it
very
drinkable
in
all
a
highly
drinkable
beer
since
it
is
very
smooth
and
subtle
about
its
oatmeal
stoutness
aint
close
to
say
sam
smith
oatmeal
by
any
standard
but
an
easy
beer
to
throw
back
pretty
average
bitter
unsweetened
chocolate
dry
finish
with
not
much
bite
or
thickness
o
man
is
this
ever
easy
drinking

ibu
definitely
an
easy
lifter
and
sessionable
i
really
like
the
fullness
and
the
straightforwardness
of
it
not
a
lot
of
complexity
it
reminds
me
of
my
childhood
days
when
i
poured
hersheys
on
my
bland
oatmeal
overall
a
very
sweet
and
rich
stout
a
little
two
rich
for
my
blood
i
do
like
sweeter
beers
but
they
are
usually
stronger
than
this
perhaps
of
roasty
malts
would
balance
this
out
nicely
overall
this
beer
did
little
to
impress
me
this
beer
could
have
been
so
much
more
a
rich
hearty
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
very
enjoyable
o
pretty
good
i
could
see
how
this
would
do
well
with
some
barrel
aging
too
bad
i
didnt
score
a
bottle
would
definitely
get
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
that
tends
too
strongly
to
the
bitter
side
for
me
to
truly
enjoy
it
as
well
as
id
like
o
the
wonderful
dry
stout
has
a
nice
complex
roasted
profile
that
is
balanced
by
very
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
aswell
this
is
a
big
beer
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewer
and
im
happy
to
report
ive
got
five
more
where
this
bottle
came
from
its
got
some
bitterness
to
it
but
its
so
smooth
its
easy
to
sip
oa
nice
stout
but
lacking
anything
to
put
it
over
the
top
tyranena
down
n
dirty
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
35
o
an
interesting
pairing
of
american
and
english
beermaking
this
oatmeal
stout
will
not
leave
anyone
fan
of
dark
beer
disappointed
that
said
it
probably
wont
excite
anyone
too
greatly
the
great
thing
for
tyranena
though
is
that
their
middleoftheroad
beers
are
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
in
the
same
price
range
case
in
point
down
n
dirty
overall
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
really
enjoyed
the
dark
malt
flavours
the
smooth
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
followed
by
the
smoky
aroma
it
could
use
a
little
bit
more
in
the
flavour
department
but
i
wont
mind
buying
a
sixer
of
this
the
next
time
i
feel
like
an
oatmeal
stout
especially
as
its
a
good
value
4
o
this
is
a
model
example
of
an
oatmeal
stout
from
its
body
to
its
complex
flavors
it
comes
through
in
all
the
right
areas
its
a
fantastic
beer
to
sip
on
and
would
make
a
perfect
brew
to
have
with
breakfast
or
to
close
out
your
night
o
promising
but
overall
the
actual
beer
tastes
watered
down
personal
rate
4
d
tasty
well
balanced
oatmeal
stout
poured
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fairly
stable
single
finger
of
tan
colored
head
but
only
minimal
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
tones
blended
with
milk
chocolate
and
a
splash
of
coffee
tastes
more
of
the
milk
chocolate
than
the
roastedness
from
the
nose
sadly
seems
overall
to
be
balanced
somewhat
too
sweet
for
my
personal
preferences
but
ymmv
i
just
prefer
my
stouts
a
little
bit
less
sugary
and
caramelized
than
this
smooth
texture
and
lighter
carbonation
over
a

the

this
is
a
medium

brew
that
is
silky
smooth
in
the
feel
it
is
rich
and
quite
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
incorporated
here
the
most
excellent
aspect
of
this
brew
is
the
fresh
grainy
chocolate
quality
captured
in
the
aroma
i
really
would
have
liked
to
seen
that
transcended
into
the
flavor
a
bit
more
asis
its
a
nice
experience
and
worth
a
try
very
good
on
tap
at
cardinal
bar
madison
quite
pleasurable
im
totally
impressed
with
this

tried

an

from

chocolate
greets
the
tastebuds
and
quickly
shifts
to
slightly

finally
finishing
with
a
return
to
chocolate
with
roasty
bitterness
fairly
creamy

smooth
mediumbodied
dead
on
for
the
style
a
solid
easy
drinking
oatmeal
stout
that
delivers
o
pretty
good
representation
of
the
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
genre
of
beer
its
highest
qualities
are
the
mouthfeel
and
the
smell
o
a
winner
a
brewery
i
was
afraid
to
try
for
fear
of
a
let
down
but
this
is
very
impressive
this
is
far
from
my
favorite

brew
but
it
is
still
very
drinkable
m
chocolate
dry
wellmade
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
can
sometimes
work
well
together
but
theres
somewhat
of
a
clash
going
on
here
a
tad
harsh
for
the
style
not
sure
if
age
is
playing
a
factor
here
but
id
like
a
shift
away
from
the
darkbitter
roasty
malts
towards
some
sweetness
to
help
increase
session
enjoyment

tyranena
is
a
brewery
that
i
want
to
pull
for
im
wondering
if
the
continual
assistant
brewer
turnover
there
is
hindering
what
this
brewery
is
capable
of
where
are
the
distant
bgw
gems
that
this
brewery
used
to
put
out
where
is
the
unrealized
potential
kinda
tired
of
the
mediocre
beers
tyranena
seems
to
be
putting
out
as
of
late
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
smells
and
tastes
great
i
was
really
excited
for
this
beer
poured
very
dark
dark
brown
with
a
short
just
off
white
head
some
light
gets
through
around
the
edges
there
is
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
but
it
is
very
sparse
the
first
thing
i
thought
when
i
smelled
this
beer
was
roasty
this
is
very
very
roasty
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
not
much
else
it
is
pleasant
but
on
the
way
to
being
too
roasty
the
flavor
however
is
too
roasty
it
tastes
like
a
ton
of
burnt
malt
was
in
this
one
it
overwhelms
everything
else
sort
of
tastes
like
eating
a
handful
of
patent
malt
not
horrible
but
very
overly
roasty
and
burnt
mouthfeel
does
not
give
you
the
creamy
smooth
texture
that
i
like
and
it
is
a
bit
light
but
it
is
ok
this
beer
is
really
nice
but
could
definitely
be
improved
upon
down
n
dirty
is
a
flavorful
oatmeal
stout
with
a
complex
taste
profile
that
moves
far
beyond
its
chocolate
essence
cheers
very
solid
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
sublime
and
i
love
the
strong
chocolate
presence
do
pretty
solid
oatmeal
stout
with
just
enough
chocolate
to
set
it
apart
highly
drinkable
recommended
to
oatmeal
stout
fans
overall
another
great
brew
by
a
great
brewery
i
found
this
6
pack
last
week
on
the
shelves
so
it
must
have
gotten
lost
in
the
back
of
the
liquor
store
cause
this
beer
is
released
in
march
i
believe
still
tastes
great
so
it
has
aged
well
so
far
id
say
a
good
oatmeal
stout
the
chocolate
adds
more
to
the
smell
than
to
the
flavor
taste
strikes
me
as
a
little
unbalanced
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
flat
turning
what
could
be
a
very
good
beer
into
one
thats
enjoyable
but
not
super
impressive
hard
to
choose
this
when
theres
founders
breakfast
stout
around
granted
thats
a
bigger
beer
but
its
everything
this
is
and
so
much
more
mouthfeel
this
beer
feels
rather
watery
for
a
porter
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
out
of
this
brewery
o
solid
nothing
to
wrtie
home
about
but
a
great
beer
to
just
sit
down
and
enjoy
overall
just
ok
would
have
liked
more
body
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
bitter
needs
more
balance
o
overall
a
really
nice
oatmeal
stout
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
lots
of
coffe
up
front
in
the
taste
and
a
great
mouthfeel
would
have
again
o
i
love
this
beer
and
id
have
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
stacks
up
well
against
any
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
o
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
better
than
the
nose
led
me
to
think
it
was
gonna
be
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
but
im
glad
i
did
trying
the
tyranena
down
dirty
oatmeal
stout
after
a
very
cool
june
day
here
in
the
chicagoland
area
the
appearance
is
typical
of
a
good
stout
rich
deep
dark
color
with
thinnoexisten
ecru
head
the
smell
has
a
roastness
to
it
with
a
slight
blend
of
herseys
chocolate
kiss
the
taste
is
really
good
i
like
this
stout
it
has
a
nice
full
body
that
is
not
over
powered
by
abv
the
roast
with
chocolate
undertones
really
balance
nicely
i
could
session
this
during
any
winter
night
on
a
hot
day
it
might
be
tough
bottle
sample
quite
dark
milk
chocolate
colour
with
decent
clarity
had
to
pour
vigoursly
to
get
much
head
which
disappeared
quickly

faint
roast
and
powdered
chocolate
taste
lactic
quality
from
the
oatmeal
followed
by
a
more
powdered
chocolate
and
roast
not
overly
sweet
balanced
out
with
hoproast
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
as
it
coats
the
mouth
is
a
pleasant
fashion
decent
if
not
unspectacular
o
this
beer
was
a
delight
to
drink
it
was
very
smooth
and
left
you
wanting
more
after
each
sip
i
really
liked
the
balance
of
the
extra
chocolate
and
coffee
overload
i
will
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
and
again
on
the
shelves
solid
beer
at
a
solid
price
would
recommend
to
fans
of
the
style
and
noobs
alike
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
brew
mostly
because
of
the
name
in
my
opinion
if
youre
going
to
call
your
brew
down
n
dirty
oatmeal
chocolate
stout
youd
better
bring
your
a
game
because
youre
going
to
have
to
throw
down
with
founders
rouge
southern
tier
etc
which
make
incredible
chocolate
stouts
down
n
dirty
was
good
and
quite
drinkable
but
is
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
others
nose
was
pretty
faint
body
was
a
little
thin
imo
the
roasty
malts
light
coco
mild
earthy
and
oats
are
good
but
not
enough
to
grease
my
train
wheels
deep
dark
brown
pour
with
a
nice
inch
of
tan
head
on
top
slow
fade
left
behind
a
minmal
head
but
some
decent
side
glass
lacing
the
aroma
was
rich
with
roasted
malts
hints
of
molasses
and
burnt
caramel
and
a
touch
of
a
smoke
like
note
as
well
even
feel
here
with
a
lighter
side
of
dull
but
still
nice
feel
on
it
the
flavor
came
through
nicely
balanced
with
a
rich
profile
that
was
not
over
the
top
and
a
mellow
finish
that
really
hit
the
spot
o
a
fine
brew
since
i
tried
this
last
year
it
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
i
just
wish
it
was
yearround
that
and
tyranena
got
more
out
to
my
area
o
a
great
stout
to
drinks
regularly
i
would
buy
this
whenever
i
just
wanted
a
good
stout
to
drink
for
a
reasonable
price
and
easy
to
get
o
this
does
end
up
being
a
nice
session
beer
decent
beer
from
tyranena
flavor
is
smooth
with
chocolatecoffee
tones
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
tasty
and
worth
doing
again
i
will
drink
these
happily
and
perhaps
pick
up
more
again
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
diminishes
rather
quickly
the
lacing
though
on
this
beer
is
amazing
there
is
a
constant
lace
ring
around
the
beer
the
whole
time
smells
of
roasted
barley
oatmeal
chocolate
bread
and
smoke
the
smell
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
but
works
the
taste
is
phenomenal
strong
hints
of
roasted
barley
sweet
chocolate
and
oatmeal
mouthful
is
pretty
thin
and
there
isnt
much
carbonation
there
overall
i
love
this
beer
there
are
a
few
characteristics
that
dont
make
this
beer
worldclass
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
those
and
puts
this
into
an
elite
category
of
good
beers
i
will
definitely
have
this
on
my
radar
to
grab
in
the
future
o
a
nice
beer
for
an
oatmeal
stout
a
clone
of
lost
coast
comes
to
mind
but
points
are
lost
as
the
chocolate
is
more
hyped
than
delivered
at
this
price
point
ill
be
willing
to
pay
more
for
more
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
light
tan
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
dark
and
milk
chocolate
cocoa
powder
graham
cracker
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beers
aroma
the
taste
is
just
as
chocolaty
as
the
aroma
milk
chocolate
comes
through
during
the
sip
with
lingering
dark
chocolate
in
the
finish
there
is
also
nice
backing
roasted
malt
and
graham
cracker
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
fine
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
i
enjoyed
the
beefedup
version
of
this
bgw
series
baby
so
i
had
to
try
the
usual
one
it
pours
a
matte
onyx
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
coffee
dark
chocolate
powder
chocolate
syrup
light
molasses
and
a
touch
of
smoke
in
the
background
the
taste
darkens
things
decidedly
including
deepening
the
roast
lightly
acidifying
the
coffee
further
darkening
the
chocolate
and
slightly
amping
up
the
smoke
character
the
body
is
a
lightfeeling
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
though
it
felt
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
my
tastes
this
was
a
pretty
solid
stout
finish
smokey
malts
with
subtle
hop
notes
in
the
back
mouthed
brownies
and
barleywine
heavy
sugared
coffee
beans
that
sticks
with
you
uplifting
at
6
3
rather
then
a
kbs
that
lulls
you
into
gentle
sleep
not
much
depth
to
this
but
rather
varying
flavors
floating
about
on
their
own
body
is
on
the
thin
side
for
style
but
doesnt
detract
too
much
carbonation
is
good
with
a
fairly
slick
mouthfeel
finish
is
a
little
sweet
flavor
doesnt
last
too
long
on
the
palate
a
good
beer
no
doubt
not
sure
id
advertise
the
chocolate
part
maybe
just
call
it
an
oatmeal
stout
and
let
the
drinker
discover
the
chocolate
i
am
seldom
let
down
by
a
tyranena
beer
i
certainly
was
not
let
down
by
this
one
not
quite
a
dessert
beer
i
never
thought
id
see
this
one
let
alone
get
to
try
it
tyranena
has
been
in
indiana
for
awhile
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
saw
this
one
i
love
the
bgw
version
so
this
was
a
must
try
it
poured
a
velvety
smooth
black
with
no
head
just
khaki
bubbles
that
laced
the
glass
the
aromas
arent
as
bold
as
i
imagined
the
coffee
is
actually
really
light
and
kind
of
subtle
the
featured
aroma
is
really
bitter
chocolate
it
has
some
light
funk
to
it
the
flavor
is
both
sweet
and
bitter
chocolates
with
a
light
coffee
roast
its
drinkable
and
not
too
sweet
its
a
good
beer
but
it
really
makes
me
want
a
doubly
down
n
even
dirtier
this
beer
put
the
sequel
in
proper
perspective
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
not
the
best
in
the
style
and
certainly
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
founders
but
this
is
a
nice
little
american
stout
a
good
example
though
a
bit
light
on
the
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
categories
for
myself
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
oaty
stout
and
a
fine
substitute
for
fbs
tyranenas
down
n
dirty
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
is
a
wonderful
stout
it
pours
with
little
head
like
most
stouts
i
guess
and
has
a
rich
black
color
the
smell
and
taste
are
great
it
has
a
coffee
type
bitterness
which
is
quite
yummy
dont
taste
much
chocolate
though
the
mouth
feel
is
typical
for
a
stout
it
is
very
rich
and
has
a
complexity
that
is
very
nice
i
think
tyranena
is
a
good
brewery
havent
had
anything
form
them
that
wasnt
pretty
good
very
toasty
roast
flavor
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
this
is
above
average
but
nothing
special
didnt
expect
much
form
tyranena
so
it
actually
exceeded
by
expectations
this
was
a
weird
beer
experience
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
i
drank
had
low
carbonation
which
made
the
beer
seem
flat
made
the
roast
a
bit
over
harsh
and
made
the
body
feel
thin
and
watery
the
second
pour
out
of
the
bottle
was
moderately
carbonated
and
all
of
the
other
elements
of
the
beer
swung
into
balance
i
think
the
beer
doesnt
hold
its
carbonation
particularly
well
but
right
out
of
the
bottle
its
pretty
damn
good
d
glad
i
tried
it
but
doubt
id
seek
it
out
again
way
better
options
in
the
realm
of
american
stouts
from
the
region
skål
d
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
delicious
tyranena
brew
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
is
rather
tasty
beer
i
could
have
more
than
a
few
great
for
the
winter
months
of
the
great
lakes
near
the
fireplace
after
dinner
drinkability
it
is
a
great
stout
that
drinks
well
this
is
a
great
stout
coming
from
wisconsin
cheers
da
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
black
as
ink
stout
with
no
highlights
well
maybe
one
yeah
black
has
a
nice
light
brown
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
jump
from
the
glass
as
you
pour
the
beer
in
hints
of
molasses
in
the
background
tempt
you
even
further
deep
roasted
malt
notes
dominate
the
flavor
with
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
black
coffee
in
the
background
silky
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
good
roasted
malt
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
good
one
overall
a
really
complex
fantastic
stout
one
id
be
happy
coming
back
to
over
and
over
glad
i
have
five
more
flavor
was
not
all
that
chocolaty
as
the
name
would
suggest
but
easily
one
of
the
better
oatmeal
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
notes
a
wonderful
oatmeal
stout
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
works
well
a
very
nice
beer
with
plenty
of
chocolate
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
i
dont
exactly
know
what
to
think
about
this
brew
i
certainly
like
it
and
will
probably
drink
it
again
but
i
dont
think
that
i
will
reach
fro
it
when
i
am
looking
for
an
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
below
average
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
and
everything
came
together
very
nicely
the
chocolate
was
nicely
done
and
was
pretty
well
balanced
out
with
the
bitterness
the
oats
brought
everything
together
and
added
a
very
nice
smoothness
to
it
a
very
flavorful
beer
overall
and
a
very
good
choice
to
sip
on
after
dinner
this
evening
a
good
oatmeal
stout
i
cant
say
its
the
best
but
definitely
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
smooth
and
silky
from
the
oats
a
bit
plain
but
a
nice
stout
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
good
depth
nice
chocolate
character
roasty
and
bitter
yet
still
very
smooth
this
was
definitely
a
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
to
savor
and
enjoy
i
havent
had
a
bad
dark
beer
from
these
guys
yet
really
nice
offering
here
from
tyranena
drinks
really
well
for
being
so
roasty
im
a
huge
sucker
for
huge
roast
if
its
pulled
off
correctly
and
this
is
a
great
example
a
lot
of
beers
with
such
a
roasty
profile
get
really
astringent
but
not
this
beer
it
seems
like
the
cocoa
nibs
help
balance
things
out
a
little
bit
to
counter
the
roast
but
ultimately
its
pretty
lopsided
on
the
roasty
side
and
i
love
that
if
there
was
a
little
more
dark
caramel
flavor
in
the
midrange
i
could
easily
see
this
contending
for
one
of
the
best
stouts
of
any
kind
ive
ever
had
tyranena
delivers
some
really
terrific
dark
beers
this
is
a
very
nice
oatmeal
stout
perfectly
sweet
and
bitter
yet
messy
in
that
the
flavor
and
aromas
are
all
over
the
place
great
for
an
oatmeal
stout
goes
great
with
chocolate
or
dark
fruit
like
cherries
f
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
little
hint
of
lingering
sticky
sweetness
even
more
bitterness
this
time
again
mostly
from
the
earthy
charred
roasty
malts
but
a
little
spicy
hop
flavor
as
well
this
time
lots
of
lingering
creamy
milk
or
lactose
flavors
with
oatmeal
on
the
side
the
chocolate
roast
and
coffee
all
blend
together
at
the
end
and
come
through
in
the
center
of
the
finish
but
not
as
prevalent
as
the
initial
taste
although
the
coffee
does
seem
to
start
to
come
out
a
bit
more
a
little
cocoa
nibs
too
on
the
finish
it
drinks
pretty
well
but
the
bitterness
edges
it
a
little
too
much
all
in
all
this
brew
was
a
let
down
not
worth
hunting
and
definitely
not
a
top
line
stout
i
am
so
tempted
to
pull
a
bcs
from
the
fridge
to
make
up
for
this
one
well
see
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
tasty
stout
could
use
a
little
more
body
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
winner
d
this
was
a
nice
surprise
wasnt
expecting
too
much
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkable
glad
i
picked
up
this
wisconsin
brew
d
good
but
not
great
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
chocolate
presence
given
the
addition
of
actual
chocolate
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
tan
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
nice
touch
of
chocolatetoffee
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
chocolatetoffee
notes
galour
medium
body
a
nice
smooth
brew
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
drinkable
another
very
tasty
brew
from
tyranena
md
fuller
body
fine
carbonation
bubbles
makes
for
a
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
for
this
style
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
even
toward
the
light
side
smooth
with
a
zippy
finish
overall
based
off
the
name
i
was
excited
for
this
beer
but
it
really
didnt
pack
the
flavors
that
i
was
expecting
being
let
down
is
an
understatement
not
going
to
be
drinking
a
lot
of
this
d
just
ok
this
tyranena
offering
lacks
degree
of
complexity
which
is
a
shame
since
it
definitely
has
the
body
to
pull
it
off
characteristic
oatmeal
stout
flavor
dominates
everything
else
leaving
little
to
be
enjoyed
id
give
this
another
go
but
this
isnt
really
one
of
tyranenas
winners
overall
this
was
another
really
nice
beer
from
tyranena
brewing
thanks
again
kevin
recommended
i
finially
found
the
variety
pack
tyranena
variety
packs
have
been
hard
to
find
since
they
hit
indiana
shelves
pours
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
short
dark
tan
head
smells
like
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
coffee
stands
out
the
most
in
the
taste
to
me
a
nice
medium
body
the
oatmeal
gives
it
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
feel
not
too
heavy
at
all
i
could
have
another
the
drinkability
of
this
makes
it
a
beer
for
nearly
any
occasion
highly
recommended
if
you
like
chocolate
or
coffee
style
stouts
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
are
immediately
apparent
on
the
palate
as
the
nose
suggests
its
quite
grainy
and
malty
pleasantly
so
with
wholesome
bread
and
biscuit
flavors
along
with
more
subtle
tones
of
vanilla
and
black
licorice
its
fullbodied
quite
rich
and
flavorful
for
the
relatively
modest
abv
go
figure
another
great
tyranena
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
super
smooth
the
carbonation
is
low
and
works
really
well
with
the
beers
character
this
is
a
super
nice
oatmeal
stout
i
would
buy
this
beer
often
if
it
was
in
the
cincinnati
market
d
not
a
bad
stout
definitely
alot
of
oatmeal
in
this
definitely
denser
than
i
was
expecting
but
i
always
like
surprises
gets
more
bitter
as
you
drink
it
not
your
average
oatmeal
stout
for
sure
overall
very
drinkable
beer
sweetness
is
balanced
by
the
bitterness
good
everyday
beer
tasty
for
sure
but
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
tyranena
overall
a
really
good
stout
full
of
chocolate
flavour
with
a
nice
head
that
stays
and
lacings
up
and
down
the
glass
i
bought
this
to
give
out
as
extras
since
it
is
local
but
decided
to
crack
to
see
how
it
was
and
i
was
very
surprised
very
good
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
each
component
having
its
strength
but
no
one
single
outstanding
part
either
definitely
enjoyable
and
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
couple
in
an
evening
dive
enjoyed
drinking
this
it
is
a
unique
take
on
this
style
well
done
d
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
without
it
it
would
be
rather
bland
the
cocoa
and
additional
flavors
just
seem
to
be
a
bit
thin
to
me
its
not
bad
at
all
though
a
good
drinking
oatmeal
the
pour
is
clear
yet
opaque
in
the
glass
with
better
than
a
full
finger
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
amount
of
belgian
lacing
behind
each
mouthful
the
nose
is
dominated
by
that
semisweet
necco
malt
chocolate
grainy
oatmeal
the
mouth
feel
is
well
carbonated
medium
full
body
that
adds
a
smooth
texture
to
compliment
the
oatmeal
and
roasted
malt
flavors
that
clean
up
pretty
quickly

abv
this
one
is
a
nice
drinker
enjoyed
considering
it
many
thanks
pops
deep
malty
nose
gives
way
to
a
rich
roasty
flavor
with
more
than
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
silkiness
of
oatmeal
deep
subtle
chocolate
makes
this
parable
with
dessert
and
the
finish
is
nicely
balanced
not
sweet
at
all
superb
light
yet
heavy
mouthfeel
silky
and
smooth
i
am
loving
this
as
an
alternative
to
those
12oz
stouts
that
i
feel
i
must
share
because
of
the
abv
power
this
one
i
could
have
a
few
of
my
own
well
done
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smells
rough
oatmeal
smooth
chocolate
medium
sour
and
medium
sweet
very
nice
and
rich
well
good
beer
but
im
a
bit
confused
by
it
the
flavors
dont
come
together
all
that
well
the
advertised
chocolate
is
a
bit
weak
theyve
made
so
many
excellent
beers
i
always
expect
the
most
out
of
tyranena
but
this
one
falls
short
of
previous
standards
theyve
erected
d
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
definitely
kick
back
a
few
i
will
purchase
it
again
when
i
am
looking
for
a
lighter
stout
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decentsized
tan
head
the
nose
has
some
nice
portions
to
it
with
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
however
the
roasted
character
of
the
malt
kind
of
outshadows
everything
else
making
this
fairly
onedimensional
the
taste
is
quite
similar
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
added
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
definitely
affected
by
the
sometimesharsh
character
of
the
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
from
tyranena
but
one
i
was
certainly
glad
to
try
thanks
again
barry
drinkability
tyranena
is
perhaps
wisconsins
best
brewer
this
might
be
their
best
beer
not
quaffable
but
a
few
of
these
should
make
the
night
go
better
i
could
see
this
one
going
into
my
regular
rotation
if
it
was
available
locally
very
drinkable
d
it
was
only
a
few
months
ago
that
i
had
just
found
out
about
this
brewery
and
now
i
cant
get
enough
of
their
beers
another
solid
offering
nice
flavors
easy
drinking
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
a
very
solid
beer
that
has
just
thrusted
tyranena
near
the
top
of
my
favorite
brewers
list
am
now
on
a
mission
to
find
other
selections
from
them
edited
once
i
was
shown
where
the
bottled
on
information
was
d
this
is
a
great
offering
im
a
big
fan
of
tyranena
and
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
by
them
and
may
be
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
on
tap
at
stubs
pours
a
nearly
black
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
no
lacing
average
aroma
nothing
really
sticks
out
here
some
light
chocolate
is
buried
deep
in
there
somewhere
underneath
the
light
sweetness
taste
is
great
smooth
silky
chocolate
light
graham
cracker
toasty
dry
finish
the
oats
really
add
an
excellent
silkiniess
to
this
brew
and
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
soft
yet
has
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
backside
good
oatmeal
stout
roasty
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
bitterness
lingering
mild
ashy
aftertaste
seems
pretty
clean
and
easy
drinking
i
have
no
issue
with
the
carbonation
fairly
smooth
due
to
the
oatmeal
content
im
guessing
not
too
filling
but
a
substantial
brew
thats
big
on
flavor
nice
job
tyranena
overall
a
solid
stout
coming
from
tryanena
whom
ive
come
to
expect
great
things
from
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
as
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
in
bottles
overall
a
fantastic
beer
id
highly
recommend
it
first
one
ive
had
from
tyranena
which
seems
to
be
a
relatively
new
brewery
but
ill
eagerly
look
for
from
them
in
the
future
minor
carbonation
gripe
aside
this
is
an
allaround
very
impressive
stout
another
solid
offering
from
tyranena
and
an
excellent
value
at
10sixer
this
black
bodied
beer
has
a
thick
crop
of
rocky
brown
froth
on
top
that
leaves
behind
enormous
amounts
of
lace
good
dose
of
chocolate
oatmeal
and
roasted
barley
aromas
on
the
nose
and
some
liquid
caramel
for
good
measure
not
quite
as
big
as
some
of
their
other
experimental
porters
and
stouts
but
nice
nonetheless
as
it
should
be
this
oatmeal
stout
is
silky
smooth
and
velvety
medium
bodied
or
so
nice
bitter
roasted
maltbarley
flavor
bittersweet
chocolate
character
is
fairly
low
burnt
malts
and
a
little
oily
smokiness
come
into
the
picture
as
well
as
expected
well
done
good
depth
and
complexity
d
excellent
stout
how
cool
would
it
be
for
tyranena
to
throw
a
batch
of
this
in
some
bourbon
barrels
just
to
see
what
would
happen
overall
a
very
good
beer
easy
drinker
for
sure
i
will
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
rest
of
the
bottles
i
bought
d
this
is
an
impressive
offering
from
tyranena
it
is
well
made
and
really
easy
to
drink
a
nice
change
from
so
many
big
stouts
that
hit
the
market
this
time
of
year
having
3
or
4
of
these
beers
in
a
night
would
not
be
a
chore
worth
seeking
out
recommended
d
yet
another
winner
from
tyranena
they
really
have
some
impressive
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
look
forward
to
any
stout
or
porter
they
may
come
out
with
a
very
solid
brew
and
drinkably
solid
too
tyranena
does
not
disappoint
with
this
new
addition
to
their
line
up
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
quickly
i
would
have
to
guess
this
is
around
6
alcohol
which
is
more
than
your
typical
os
really
great
representation
of
style
here
with
a
unique
touch
of
bigger
body
and
chocolate
highly
recommend
great
example
of
the
style
i
would
guess
that
the
abv
is
in
the
4
to
5
range
good
chocolate
taste
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
slight
roasty
taste
but
not
overpowering
poured
deep
black
with
underdeveloped
head
rich
roasty
chocolatey
palate
with
mild
hops
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
was
a
happy
surprise
from
a
brewery
i
had
never
heard
of
before
poured
into
a
reubens
brew
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
opaque
black
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
light
brown
film
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
mild
aroma
of
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
flavor
is
toasted
malt
nice
chocolate
day
old
coffee
finishes
with
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
char
medium
bodied
with
hints
of
creaminess
a
quite
nice
low
abv
stout
the
oatmeal
gives
it
a
much
more
pleasant
feel
than
most
light
stouts
and
the
flavors
although
not
intense
are
nicely
balanced
and
pleasant
i
dont
usually
go
to
the
stout
style
for
a
session
beer
but
if
i
did
this
would
be
an
excellent
candidate
mild
but
nicely
done
a
solid
stout
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
brown
carbonated
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
cocoa
and
oats
the
taste
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
have
thought
it
has
a
sweet
oat
flavor
yet
it
is
not
super
heavy
in
flavor
decent
body
and
very
drinkable
but
i
also
think
a
little
overrated
as
well
oscars
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
creamy
oatmeal
and
roasted
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolates
the
taste
is
creamy
roasted
mellow
chocolate
notes
all
on
a
nice
mellow
roasted
malty
backbone
the
overall
flavor
is
a
bit
weak
and
watery
overall
its
a
nice
stout
but
a
bit
weak
overall
a
decent
beer
but
one
of
these
is
enough
in
a
session
worth
giving
it
a
try
especially
since
the
chocolate
does
come
through
here
overall
its
good
it
could
be
great
if
you
could
have
it
on
nitro
or
if
they
bump
up
the
body
and
mouthfeel
a
bit
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
chocolate
stout
with
a
touch
of
roasted
aromas
oscars
wont
disappoint
this
is
a
drinkable
stout
however
the
bitterness
leaves
it
mostly
onedimensional
overall
this
is
an
average
stout
would
have
liked
it
better
if
it
had
a
little
more
body
i
poured
this
nice
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
really
dark
brew
with
a
very
nice
tan
head
the
smell
was
like
dark
roasted
nearly
burnt
grains
the
beer
did
not
taste
burnt
however
the
beer
tasted
nice
and
toasty
with
big
coffee
or
cappuccino
taste
to
it
the
beer
had
good
lacing
and
had
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
i
dont
like
that
but
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
pours
dark
black
with
some
tanoff
white
foam
nose
is
strong
oat
chocolate
malt
too
present
but
not
potent
taste
is
a
smooth
sweet
chocolate
malt
oat
finish
very
subdued
hop
milky
but
not
lactosey
very
light
and
balanced
good
flavor
good
stout
the
flavor
has
a
good
malt
presence
with
some
caramel
and
moderately
sweet
cocoa
tinges
with
light
dried
fruit
taste
and
very
low
bitterness
with
some
light
roast
flavor
and
very
gentle
yeast
in
the
finish
adding
to
the
sweetness
and
grain
of
the
oats
overall
i
enjoyed
this
but
it
is
pretty
subdued
and
i
would
probably
prefer
a
bolder
oatmeal
stout
to
be
honest
it
has
a
nice
drinkability
for
the
strength
though
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
enjoyed
the
roasty
smokiness
of
it
but
i
feel
the
chocolate
was
lacking
typically
i
enjoy
the
roast
flavors
over
the
sweeter
one
but
i
feel
like
when
you
advertise
a
beer
as
being
a
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
there
should
be
a
strong
chocolate
presence
either
way
this
is
an
enjoyable
stout
seems
like
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
pleasing
enough
but
nothing
special
tasted
like
guinness
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
was
a
little
thin
for
me
for
a
stout
i
may
have
a
few
of
these
on
st
pats
day
as
like
i
said
it
is
close
enough
to
guinness
the
smell
was
nothing
special
faint
chocolate
with
some
roasted
malts
nice
dark
look
in
the
glass
m
far
too
watery
and
thin
for
my
preferences
medium
carbonation
overall
not
much
going
for
it
it
lacks
the
richness
that
the
aroma
suggests
which
only
makes
the
flavor
more
disappointing
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
cant
imagine
seeking
it
out
again
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
a
simple
low
abv
stout
with
big
flavor
i
wonder
why
it
isnt
rayed
higher
on
beer
advocate
worth
a
try
for
stout
fans
its
saturday
night
and
time
for
dessert
trying
a
sand
creek
oscar
chocolate
stout
the
stout
poured
dark
opaque
with
offwhite
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
includes
roast
chocolate
and
some
espresso
the
taste
includes
roast
chocolate
and
espresso
much
like
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
light
body
perhaps
too
much
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
stout
not
the
best
but
definitely
good
i
hope
that
bear
can
brew
a
good
beer
it
pours
a
dark
garnettinged
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
syrup
roasted
malts
toasted
oats
and
a
small
bit
o
molasses
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cocoa
powder
light
coffee
very
light
molasses
and
light
roasted
malts
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
oatmeal
stout
one
that
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
with
the
chocolate
which
often
ends
in
disappointment
frankly
not
bad
at
all
my
first
oatmeal
stout
and
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
feel
like
this
is
not
a
good
first
example
of
the
style
o
the
nose
on
this
suggested
a
stronger
fuller
flavor
that
really
never
appeared
warming
did
not
bring
out
any
more
taste
notes
strictly
average
here
tastes
are
sour
dank
chocolate
raspberry
vomit
wild
yeast
hops
sweet
sweet
sweet
oatmeal
mocha
caramel
some
roast
ink
and
dried
fruits
smells
like
a
stout
that
needs
to
be
aged
for
a
bit
in
some
wood
before
it
can
be
let
out
and
sipped
and
enjoyed
this
pours
a
dark
nut
brown
color
and
settles
damn
near
black
with
ruby
edges
a
few
bubbles
cling
throughout
drinking
this
the
nose
is
a
bit
subtle
but
offers
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
nothing
too
special
here
the
taste
is
a
bit
bold
thankfully
chocolate
and
coffee
linger
and
are
wrapped
up
in
a
roasty
blanket
mouthfeel
is
a
lighter
feel
for
a
stout
but
it
is
very
drinkable
decent
stout
overall
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
beige
head
on
it
smell
is
heavy
coffee
taste
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
not
a
lot
of
oatmeal
coming
through
for
me
medium
bodied
beer
pretty
good
overall
my
wife
absolutely
loves
it
im
sure
it
will
have
a
regular
spot
in
our
fridge
o
overall
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
that
is
fairly
drinkable
and
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
with
its
low
gravity
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
unless
i
ever
make
it
to
wisconsin
to
try
it
on
draft
second
chances
every
beer
deserves
one
almost
di
found
this
a
bit
difficult
to
finish
just
because
i
kept
on
hoping
more
from
each
sip
only
to
discover
that
the
same
bland
taste
lasted
throughout
d
this
beer
made
very
little
sense
and
was
not
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
would
pass
on
this
one
should
i
see
it
again
basically
and
iced
coffee
coffee
coffee
an
above
average
oatmeal
stout
that
is
worth
a
try
notes
a
pretty
good
oatmeal
stout
not
outstanding
but
good
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
know
if
it
would
necessarily
be
worth
seeking
out
open
the
bottle
nice
caramel
tones
and
little
hop
character
head
retentionis
very
nice
lasts
very
long
and
looks
very
dark
much
like
a
stout
should
look
the
appearance
is
very
dark
with
little
light
passing
through
it
very
nice
the
taste
has
caramel
and
chocolate
overtones
little
hops
can
be
tasted
the
beer
is
overal
very
good
and
is
a
great
stout
and
i
usually
buy
a
6
pack
whenever
i
can
nothing
particularly
astounding
is
going
on
with
this
beer
but
its
certainly
decent
its
pleasant
enough
to
drink
it
just
seems
tame
to
me
no
regrets
about
trying
it
but
i
likely
wont
pick
it
up
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
deep
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
2
finger
milk
chocolate
head
that
didnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
weak
some
chocolate
burnt
caramel
definitely
some
malt
character
and
a
little
spice
hop
note
the
taste
was
a
little
weak
as
well
some
chocolate
hops
almost
take
over
any
sweetness
there
might
have
been
a
little
too
much
bitterness
medium
body
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
stout
but
much
better
in
the
class
d
i
wont
be
having
this
again
just
not
impressed
at
all
the
flavor
was
a
little
off
nose
wasnt
all
that
but
the
feel
was
just
a
crime
never
had
a
stout
so
coarse
and
i
hope
i
never
do
again
seems
perhaps
a
touch
light
in
the
body
certainly
a
great
beer
and
id
drink
this
every
day
maybe
be
happier
with
it
in
the
summer
months
when
its
hotter
and
i
want
something
lighter
conclusion
good
looking
beer
that
fails
to
come
through
in
the
flavor
department
d
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
for
for
breakfast
but
itll
do
the
trick
a
good
oatmeal
stout
thatll
hold
its
own
against
any
others
being
strong
and
assertive
makes
it
a
bit
more
of
a
chore
to
drink
beyond
one
or
two
j
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
for
a
stout
slightly
chalky
overall
a
nice
stout
with
a
great
nose
d
very
good
a
very
sessionable
though
not
ideally
flavored
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
fans
of
the
style
who
want
to
drink
a
lot
without
getting
too
drunk
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
stout
not
very
overpowering
with
its
taste
but
flavorful
enough
to
keep
it
pretty
interesting
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
without
thinking
twice
about
it
not
too
bad
sort
of
dont
understand
so
many
of
the
low
scores
here
maybe
some
batch
inconsistencies
pleasant
brew
not
too
complex
but
would
happily
have
a
couple
this
was
pleasant
enough
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
flavorful
though
a
quick
growing
three
finger
head
jumps
to
the
top
of
my
glass
and
fades
slowly
head
is
toasted
biscuit
brown
in
color
body
is
jet
black
and
only
shows
hints
of
light
when
held
to
flame
nose
is
roasty
with
toasted
malts
that
are
really
bready
includes
some
coco
and
soft
spice
also
enters
the
mouth
with
that
same
roasty
feel
very
malty
up
front
on
the
palate
it
is
a
bit
thin
mid
palate
but
quickly
fills
in
with
some
dry
bitter
feel
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
the
oats
keep
this
brew
smooth
throughout
mouthfeel
is
dry
bitter
and
slightly
thick
but
it
still
stays
soft
drinkability
is
very
good
i
actually
had
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
towards
the
end
of
this
beer
and
it
was
the
perfect
pairing
d
it
is
a
fairly
good
drinkable
stout
you
can
taste
the
chocolate
but
im
torn
with
what
seems
moderate
carbonation
but
it
is
good
black
in
color
but
with
faint
hints
of
light
threatening
to
break
through
if
you
hold
it
up
to
direct
light
if
you
were
to
say
brown
it
would
be
a
very
very
dark
brown
very
little
lacing
and
a
bit
of
prickle
very
sweet
malt
nose
and
a
little
whiff
of
banana
and
quite
a
bit
of
coffee
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
pleasant
coffee
smoke
and
a
little
oatmeal
in
the
flavor
it
drinks
better
than
it
looked
upon
the
initial
pour
the
prickle
and
coloration
of
the
stout
made
me
nervous
as
it
looked
more
like
a
dry
irish
stout
than
a
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
the
flavor
removed
my
fears
some
sweet
maltiness
in
the
flavor
that
is
carried
by
the
body
and
the
abundant
flavor
from
the
roasted
malt
d
an
easily
sessionable
beer
if
you
dont
get
a
little
bored
d
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
its
refreshing
and
the
complexity
is
delightful
thanks
joshuaseresse
for
the
chance
to
revisit
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
not
quite
black
with
a
nice
twofinger
tan
head
that
fell
slowly
and
lacing
ensued
i
could
smell
the
roasty
chocolate
aroma
as
i
poured
it
into
a
nonic
very
nice
smell
to
it
flavor
is
mostly
chocolate
plenty
of
chocolate
malts
used
in
this
one
and
not
some
much
roasted
malt
very
creamy
tasting
notes
of
vanilla
caramel
and
coffee
are
also
present
but
not
too
strong
or
overwhelming
it
tastes
very
nice
but
its
not
complex
and
is
unfortunately
a
little
light
on
body
its
silky
smooth
but
a
bit
watery
on
the
finish
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
quite
sessionable
i
will
easily
put
back
2
or
3
of
these
tonight
dark
dark
brown
in
the
pour
borders
on
black
when
held
to
the
light
very
faint
roasted
aroma
slight
metalliccoppery
tinge
to
it
mellow
roasted
flavor
with
a
faint
hop
bite
to
it
again
it
has
a
somewhat
metal
taste
to
it
rather
thin
body
wise
lacks
the
silky
smoothness
of
an
oatmeal
stout
a
notch
above
average
overall
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
stout
it
is
certainly
reasonable
given
the
price
and
availability
for
my
location
i
will
enjoy
it
when
available
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
being
that
its
under
5
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
and
its
only
moderately
carbonated
if
it
were
a
bit
stronger
in
carbonation
then
it
may
have
had
a
chance
to
show
more
flavor
pretty
tame
but
very
drinkable
i
first
tried
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
and
was
quite
inexperienced
in
characterizing
different
attributes
of
beer
since
then
ive
learned
enough
to
recognize
the
uniqueness
of
this
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
and
realize
how
enjoyable
this
beer
really
is
if
you
have
not
tried
oscars
your
doing
yourself
a
disservice
very
tasty
and
flavorful
light
stout
black
body
light
head
that
stayed
pretty
fluffy
sweet
chocolate
and
a
very
light
roasted
malt
scents
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
stout
light
body
and
low
carbonation
stronger
chocolate
malts
than
roasted
making
it
more
of
a
porter
style
but
hey
its
a
good
stout
still
medium
body
pretty
low
carbonation
feels
watery
in
my
mouth
pleasant
and
tasty
with
some
nice
details
and
a
decent
feel
goes
down
pretty
easily
not
the
first
beer
id
grab
but
one
i
could
certainly
sip
on
for
an
evening
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
bad
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
d
4

makes
this
quite
sessionable
id
defintely
drink
this
again
d
very
weak
and
simple
im
sure
i
could
drink
more
of
these
it
wasnt
offensive
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
only
if
i
was
desperate

out
the

made

and
a

a

still
and
a
good
sweet
stout
for
sure
pretty
nice
stout
for
sure
not
too
strong
or
in
your
face
but
a
great
easy
drinking
darker
brew
for
a
summer
night
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
there
is
a
creaminess
to
it
that
coats
the
mouth
however
for
a
stout
this
is
a
bit
on
the
light
and
watery
side
it
is
still
heavier
than
your
average
beer
very
drinkable
this
one
has
a
great
flavor
d
see
above
not
a
typical
bitter
stout
this
is
a
decent
beginners
stout
d
overall
an
okay
stout
could
be
a
bit
stronger
in
the
flavor
department
but
its
pretty
easy
drinking
go
for
a
bells
instead
an
ok
stout
more
approachable
than
challenging
glad
i
tried
it
but
will
likely
not
try
it
again
d
this
is
a
good
oatmeal
stout
not
exceptional
but
certainly
worth
a
try
and
a
good
value
dpretty
easy
to
find
in
wi
at
taverns
and
restaurants
not
bad
when
faced
with
the
usual
bmc
line
up
but
i
would
definitely
reach
for
a
samuel
smith
is
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
oatmeal
stout
this
one
is
very
heavy
and
that
makes
it
tough
for
a
session
brew
but
as
a
sipper
im
all
for
it
very
nice
nice
brew
goes
well
with
simple
chocolate
not
overly
bitter
or
flavored
not
particularly
special
but
overall
worthwhile
poured

a
very

kind
of
on
the
light
side
very
drinkable
d
could
have
many
of
these
a
light
dark
beer
there
is
so
much
out
there
that
has
alot
more
taste
than
this
i
like
iced
coffee
with
cream
and
sweetener
this
beer
would
make
an
interesting
substitute
i
could
see
pouring
it
over
ice
with
some
cream
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
to
stand
up
to
the
ice
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
very
nice
cocoay
beer
drinkability
though
not
a
terrible
stout
it
is
a
tad
depressing
d
a
good
all
around
stout
nothing
really
outstanding
but
no
complaints
either
flavor
was
also
decent
more
sweet
coffeeness
with
some
roastiness
there
was
also
a
vegetable
flavor
that
i
found
a
bit
offputting
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
flat
but
not
awful
altogether
a
not
displeasing
package
but
certainly
far
from
excellent

a
sixer
this
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
one
finger
mocha
head
it
smells
great
with
strong
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
the
flavor
is
weird
it
has
a
great
initial
chocolate
flavor
but
that
fades
very
quickly
to
a
thin
taste
and
feeling
it
is
very
creamy
though
it
almost
makes
me
think
that
this
beer
might
be
past
its
prime
but
there
is
no
best
by
or
born
on
date
to
check
this
was
poured
fairly
warm
it
had
a
nice
big
foamy
textured
head
that
quickly
subsided
to
just
a
trace
only
a
hint
of
lace
opaque
brown
color
light
malty
roasty
chocolatey
aroma
not
as
much
taste
as
ive
noticed
before
but
this
bottle
here
at
home
is
a
bit
old
nice
mouthfilling
body
with
a
bit
of
softness
pleasant
dark
malt
roasty
finish
nice
beer
pours
to
a
dark
brown
with
medium
thick
tan
head
that
lingers
well
and
leaves
okay
lacing
nice
malty
aroma
of
chocolate
and
oatmeal
that
seemed
to
wane
just
a
little
as
the
beer
warmed
but
was
still
pleasant
flavor
of
this
slightly
thinbodied
beer
was
mostly
chocolate
and
mouthfeel
was
slightly
chewy
finsih
was
medium
duration
and
pleasant
but
this
beer
could
have
been
even
better
had
the
body
been
a
little
fuller
drinkability
my
first
sampling
from
sand
creek
i
picked
this
up
from
a
store
that
had
some
not
too
fresh
brews
and
was
worried
about
the
age
of
this
single
very
good
and
drinkable
brew
if
this
is
not
fresh
i
would
like
to
try
one
that
is
as
mentioned
earlier
this
is
a
very
lightbodied
stout
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
though
it
is
far
from
offensive
and
i
could
see
it
as
being
easily
drinkable
in
fact
i
could
definitely
see
myself
recommending
this
one
to
someone
who
enjoys
a
guinness
to
broaden
their
horizons
but
thats
about
it
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
that
appears
to
have
a
dating
notch
i
got
this
in
a
trade
so
not
sure
of
the
exact
age
so
either
a
couple
months
old
or
over
a
year
old
but
believe
couple
months
it
was
a
deep
black
in
color
even
when
held
to
the
light
had
about
a
14
of
head
that
turned
into
a
thin
foam
with
a
bunch
of
carb
bubbling
in
the
center
of
it
the
aroma
was
burnt
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
little
chocolate
the
taste
was
also
of
burnt
coffee
and
was
watery
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
watery
as
mentioned
overall
it
wasnt
very
good
but
since
not
sure
on
date
of
sample
willing
to
retry
later

na
ml
n
a
friend
asked
me
to
try
this
one
its
a
pretty
decent
oatmeal
stout
but
nothing
that
id
make
special
trips
to
wisconsin
for
beer
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
that
is
barely
hanging
around
nose
is
very
pleasant
of
chocolate
malts
taste
is
very
heavy
on
the
chocolate
malts
but
the
lack
of
hops
leaves
this
a
bit
unbalanced
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
a
bit
thinner
than
hoped
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
be
better
with
a
few
tweaks
to
the
recipe
im
not
crazy
about
oatmeal
stouts
and
that
distracting
sour
character
that
seems
to
come
with
them
but
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
beer
lighter
black
color
with
some
red
highlights
medium
controlled
tan
head
no
lacing
a
good
medium
chocolate
flavor
to
this
beer
not
sweet
but
not
bitter
either
more
milky
than
i
expected
it
leaves
sort
of
a
lactose
film
in
my
mouth
like
when
drinking
milk
nutty
roast
deep
down
some
acidic
black
malts
up
top
not
too
oatmealy
imo
good
fuller
body
not
the
smoothest
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
but
more
flavorful
than
most
very
good
for
the
price
tasted
100306
the
flavor
is
nice
and
thick
chocolate
coffee
and
the
foamy
astertaste
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
this
brew
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
two
fingers
in
height
and
tan
in
color
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
graham
cracker
cream
and
coffee
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
less
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
detracts
a
bit
from
the
flavor
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
that
i
would
drink
again
this
beer
is
a
dark
black
with
a
tan
head
there
is
no
light
coming
through
here
the
smell
is
as
the
name
implies
oatmeal
and
chocolate
also
some
caramel
hints
the
taste
is
more
oatmeal
there
are
some
sweet
chocolate
hints
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
the
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
i
could
go
for
this
beer
again
overall
this
beer
tastes
like
what
the
name
says
a
good
beer
that
is
malty
and
filling
thumbs
up
the
lack
of
any
head
dropped
it
down
on
the
appearance
scale
for
me
the
coffee
comes
through
strongest
in
the
aroma
malt
dominates
the
taste
a
medium
texture
note
quite
as
slick
as
i
like
oatmeal
stouts
to
be
very
drinkable
though
its
best
attribute
the
closest
thing
to
a
lawnmowersummer
stout
that
ive
had
originally
reviewed
april
9
2005
on
tap
at
the
gitchee
gumee
brewfest
2005
pour
of
deep
blackbrown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
so
is
the
flavor
its
consistent
but
mostly
one
dimensional
the
palate
is
smooth
and
drinkable
but
could
use
some
more
complexity
salt
is
the
smack
nice
and
chocolatey
with
strong
coffee
characteristics
tastes
like
it
has
been
flavored
with
nescafe
hazlenut
creamer
a
pleasant
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
fantastic
i
have
to
admit
i
like
this
one
a
lot
very
much
a
stlye
i
prefer
and
its
been
brewed
in
a
fashion
that
i
like
the
appearance
is
black
i
hold
it
up
to
a
light
and
i
cant
see
through
it
at
all
the
head
is
so
thin
lets
call
it
nonexistant
wonderful
roasted
malt
smell
very
rich
tastes
just
as
i
expect
a
stout
to
tastethere
is
a
distinction
around
the
malt
and
it
isnt
all
burntits
malty
sweet
wellbalanced
deep
and
dark
it
has
the
aroma
of
malt
and
sweetness
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
i
probably
shouldnt
throw
these
back
all
night
but
i
definitely
could
d
it
is
hard
to
do
a
beer
that
has
so
many
flavors
thrown
in
together
that
the
chocolate
and
most
of
the
oatmeal
is
lost
but
there
is
a
lot
of
coffee
and
tart
flavors
that
dominate
interesting
beer
but
i
think
the
stout
should
come
first
and
the
other
flavors
should
support

real

alright
the

having
a

possible
but
they
could
get

in

i
really
enjoy
this
beer
nothing
too
complex
very
drinkable
definately
recommended
gracias
to
dirtylou
for
smuggling
this
bottle
out
of
el
norte
drinkability
pretty
darn
good
this
isnt
an
amaizing
stout
but
its
good
enough
and
for
the
price
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
it
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
a
nice
combination
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
coffee
nuts
and
fruit
the
flavor
has
the
same
characteristics
of
the
aroma
but
is
also
both
sweet
and
sour
some
oatmeal
flavor
too
i
would
enjoy
a
little
more
oatmeal
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
i
really
like
this
stout
ok
it
cant
compare
to
the
worlds
great
stouts
but
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
costs
considerably
less
than
most
of
those
great
stouts
so
i
will
be
buying
it
more
often
this
is
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
quanity
without
breaking
the
bank
while
still
drinking
a
really
good
beer

chocolate

is
very

taste
is
strong
of
coffee
and
toated
malt
and
follows
through
with
the
smell
aftertaste
is
a
bit
dissapointing
and
fails
to
follow
through
from
the
taste
a
very
good
beer
that
seems
to
fail
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
really
special
going
on
here
pours
pitch
black
with
absolutely
no
head
even
though
i
gave
it
a
pretty
rough
pour
i
thin
spotty
tan
coating
is
all
to
be
seen
smell
is
quite
nice
roasty
malts
and
fresh
coffee
taste
continues
with
the
sweet
roasted
malts
coffee
and
maybe
a
hint
of
raspeberry
chocolate
it
describes
itself
as
a
chocolate
oatmeal
stout
a
bit
of
oatmeal
too
good
lacks
that
great
silky
and
creamy
body
i
find
and
look
for
in
this
style
from
there
it
cascades
downward
with
a
heavy
dose
of
fruits
and
something
that
feels
like
yeast
off
flavors
reminds
me
of
my
early
homebrewing
days
very
underwhelming
compared
to
the
great
stouts
out
there
today
solid
oatmeal
stout
worth
a
go
on
a
fresh
tap
little
to
no
carbonation
no
head
at
all
no

mouthfeel
very
thin
taste
is
not
as
robust
as
i
would
like
very
muted
thought
i
had
an
off
bottle
so
i
opened
another
one
same
exact
results
would
not
recommend
smoky
oatmeal
flavor
but
still
pretty
great
beer
looks
ok
small
head
and
light
lace
smells
of
roast
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
not
as
smooth

an
oatmeal
stout
should
be
but
still
very
good
and
i
would
buy
again
drinkable
not
ambitious
smooth
a
real
unique
take
on
the
style
here
it
looks
alright
maybe
a
little
thin
in
body
and
short
on
head
not
quite
as
decadent
and
dreamy
as
the
best
ones
look
but
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
in
my
wine
glass
the
nose
is
what
gets
interesting
it
really
smells
like
fresh
canned
blueberry
jam
true
and
through
its
insane
how
the
dark
fruit
rises
above
the
roast
of
the
barley
and
the
sweetness
of
the
oats
eyes
closed
i
would
think
i
am
smelling
blueberry
pie
or
jam
or
that
stuff
they
put
on
your
belgian
waffle
at
dennys
flavors
i
am
not
used
to
in
a
stout
for
sure
the
taste
is
just
like
the
nose
but
i
get
the
stout
part
too
this
time
it
is
indeed
a
little
thin
lacking
on
the
oat
richness
but
this
curious
blueberry
thing
more
than
makes
up
for
it
in
terms
of
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
brew
havent
had
much
from
browns
so
this
is
a
pretty
inspiring
first
impression
more
body
would
make
this
its
a
little
too
slick
as
it
is
and
could
dry
out
just
a
touch
but
a
really
solid
beer
different
because
of
the
berry
element
i
really
liked
this
my
favorite
oatmeal
stout
delicious
local
o
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
that
i
was
happy
to
pick
up
as
its
brew
only
a
few
hours
away
i
really
thought
that
the
nose
was
great
and
if
the
rest
of
the
beer
could
rise
to
that
level
this
would
be
nearing
a
musthave
3
55
overall
pretty
good
nothing
too
special
a
bit
on
the
light
side
as
far
as
malts
go
for
an
oatmeal
stout
at
least
what
im
used
to
but
still
pretty
decent
beer
that
being
said
sam
smith
is
much
better
from
what
i
remember
of
an
english
oatmeal
stout
o
its
an
okay
stout
could
be
a
okay
substitute
to
missing
out
on
your
old
standby
but
its
nothing
to
call
home
about
not
what
i
had
hoped
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
it
does
dial
back
with
the
metallic
note
after
it
warms
a
bit
but
its
a
thin
very
forgettable
stout
with
mild
flavors

well
hopefully
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
but
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
definitely
infected
if
i
had
to
guess
the
first
beer
ive
drainpoured
in
quite
a
while
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
troy
ny
pours
dark
brown
with
long
lived
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
and
cacao
body
is
full
creamy
and
smooth
caramel
malt
vanilla
coffee
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
sherry
and
hint
of
hops
combine
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
and
semidry
delicious
brew
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
ontap
at
the
brewery
which
is
a
great
place
to
relax
on
the
patio
with
a
beer
and
a
plate
of
wings
i
immediately
fell
in
love
with
the
beer
i
must
have
had
5
of
them
before
i
decided
to
switch
to
a
lighter
pale
ale
but
quickly
switched
back
to
the
oatmeal
stout
after
that
needless
to
say
i
did
no
end
up
driving
myself
home
that
night
great
beer
a
store
near
my
house
sells
6packs
of
it
and
i
am
a
frequent
customer
oa
nice
stout
a
tad
on
the
boring
side
plus
the
watery
mouthfeel
is
a
let
down
d
appears
to
have
quality
control
issues
in
the
bottling
but
to
be
fair
i
believe
i
have
an
older
bottle
i
bit
this
would
be
better
fresher
andor
on
tap
it
is
more
interesting
than
the
typical
macro
but
not
necessarily
more
drinkable
or
enjoyable
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
this
review
not
a
big
fan
overall
not
a
bad
little
oatmeal
stout
especially
for
the
price
worth
a
try
for
sure
this
beer
has
potential
but
it
doesnt
quite
meet
it
the
flavor
starts
with
chocolate
and
transitions
to
a
roasted
oats
taste
but
i
find
the
transition
to
be
somewhat
jarring
still
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
making
it
an
enjoyable
beer
omeh
lacks
a
little
flavor
for
the
style
and
although
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
have
had
many
oatmeal
stouts
that
are
superior
not
terrible
but
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
again
picked
up
a
growler
while
back
in
the
area
visiting
family
this
brewery
was
my
homer
spot
for
2
years
the
stout
pours
an
extremely
dark
blackishbrown
color
with
blood
ruby
highlights
and
a
very
thin
light
foamy
chocolate
milk
colored
head
aromas
of
light
roast
coffee
and
cream
with
a
hint
molasses
and
chocolate
flavors
are
rich
and
smooth
on
a
light
body
coffee
and
hazelnut
character
come
forward
first
with
a
smooth
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
backbone
to
keep
the
brew
on
the
sweeter
side
of
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
bitter
with
a
slick
and
lingering
finish
this
is
lighter
than
i
like
for
the
style
but
very
tasty
overall
o
i
love
oatmeal
stouts
and
this
one
was
really
nice
its
always
my
goto
at
the
tricity
valleycats
ballgame
easy
to
find
priced
well
and
characteristics
are
spot
on
a
must
try
for
a
oatmeal
stout
lover
overall
this
is
a
decent
oatmeal
stout
pretty
midrange
out
of
all
the
beers
ive
had
from
browns
this
one
takes
the
cake
welldone
and
highly
recommended
o
on
the
light
end
for
the
style
but
good
drinkability
and
enough
interest
overall
a
decent
beer
not
much
going
on
with
the
flavor
though
pretty
boring
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
if
i
wanted
a
beer
but
its
really
boring
for
the
style
there
are
a
lot
of
other
stouts
id
like
to
drink
you
dont
generally
find
a
5
25
percent
abv
stout
with
as
much
flavor
as
this
d
great
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
stout
and
not
feel
inflated
i
can
not
say
that
about
a
lot
of
stouts
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
then
again
it
fell
in
line
with
a
lot
of
porters
that
i
really
enjoyed
spritzy
like
a
soda
theres
a
light
fruitiness
i
think
this
is
far
closer
to
a
brown
ale
the
body
is
thin
particularly
for
a
oatmeal
stout
the
aftertaste
dies
nearly
immediately
perhaps
the
weakest
stout
ive
ever
had
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
really
nice
and
while
there
is
sweetness
it
is
well
balanced
and
never
feels
like
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
really
fantastic
decent
if
unspectacular
oatmeal
stout
if
i
lived
in
troy
itd
be
a
good
everyday
drink
with
meal
beer
drinkability
this
beer
drinks
very
nicely
the
unique
flavors
of
woody
campfire
smoke
mesh
well
with
the
sweetness
everything
is
brought
together
by
a
great
smooth
light
body
ive
had
this
with
some
heavily
smoked
bbq
before
and
it
is
sublime
damn
good
one
of
my
two
favorite
oatmeal
stouts
alongside
ipswich
drinkability
a
nice
sweet
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
tasty
stout
which
i
would
definitely
have
again
not
exactly
a
session
beer
as
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
quite
quaffable
nonetheless
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
the
silkiness
from
the
oats
is
really
great
and
there
isnt
too
much
in
the
way
of
chocolate
or
coffee
flavors
to
overwhelm
that
silkiness
d
great
drinkability
i
love
picking
up
a
6pack
of
this
for
a
friday
night
its
a
great
sessionable
stout
i
havent
tried
all
of
browns
brews
yet
but
it
probably
isnt
a
stretch
to
say
this
will
be
my
favorite
of
all
their
beers
this
stout
was
sampled
at
home
in
conjunction
with
belfast
bat
mcgoverns
oatmeal
stout
compared
to
the
latter
browns
was
lacking
in
a
few
qualities
being
that
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
dark
stouts
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
however
i
found
it
to
be
average
at
best
when
it
comes
to
oatmeal
stouts
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
fizzy
for
a
stout
lost
its
head
rather
quickly
and
had
a
clearthin
appearance
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
taste
though
with
some
of
that
trademark
oatmeal
taste
was
slightly
bitter
and
not
as
full
rich
or
creamy
as
better
oatmeal
stouts
often
are
i
remember
enjoying
this
stout
more
when
i
visited
the
browns
brewery
in
troy
ny
and
had
it
out
of
the
tap
i
will
give
this
another
try
though
am
not
impressed
with
this
bottled
effort
presented
via
growler
from
fellow
ba
slk2go

has
been
talking

this

a

low

taste

can
be
attributed
to
the
combination

it
brings
grassy

over

a

better
than
the
aroma
suggested

overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
was
surprised
at
the
power
of
the
peanut
butter
not
for
everyone
but
certainly
interesting
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
one
very
often
reviewed
13008
every
time
i
have
had
this
beer
it
tastes
infected
not
a
bret
sour
but
something
way
more
lacto
under
the
sour
notes
i
can
smell
the
peanuts
so
i
can
see
where
it
would
have
potential
in
a
healthy
batch
first
time
i
had
it
was
in
their
first
release
of
six
pack
bottles
when
they
were
still
using
the
gold
caps
instead
of
the
white
with
black
logo
on
it
all
of
that
run
of
uber
gubber
and
pbj
were
infected
and
recalled
maybe
i
was
so
affected
by
that
batch
i
can
taste
any
amount
of
misplaced
bacteria
in
every
newer
batch
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
definitely
room
for
improvement
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
straightforward
but
with
easily
defined
and
pleasant
mild
flavors
of
roasted
peanuts
and
chocolate
without
being
overly
sweet
o
this
was
my
favorite
from
the
night
between
the
turtle
smore
and
uber
this
had
a
lot
more
drinkability
and
to
finish
it
off
we
combined
this
with
soft
parade
to
make
the
pbj
another
job
well
done
from
shorts
i
hope
i
can
find
bottles
of
this
soon
o
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
specialties
from
shorts
although
some
complaints
about
souring
led
me
to
believe
it
might
be
an
issue
with
handling
so
a
fresh
growler
was
in
order
and
sure
enough
no
problems
delicious
o
overall
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
at
all
it
is
very
below
average
a
drain
pour
for
me
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again

o
im
a
bit
torn
on
this
beer
on
one
hand
the
nose
is
quite
strong
and
meets
the
advertised
tones
of
the
beer
on
the
other
hand
the
flavor
profile
indicates
something
is
not
quite
right
hard
to
tell
if
this
is
a
yeast
issue
sanitation
issue
oil
issue
or
simply
my
palate
on
the
intended
beer
after
ive
had
half
the
glass
the
tartness
has
become
less
evident
allowing
the
peanuts
and
malts
to
resurface
again
would
i
drink
again
yes
would
i
prefer
on
tap
yes
as
ive
had
less
issues
with
novelty
beers
deviating
from
their
former
selves
associated
with
bottle
conditions
and
dating
issues
worth
a
peak
as
a
beer
o
wasnt
going
for
a
lactic
tart
stout
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
with
a
very
nice
roasted
peanut
unfortunately
like
way
too
many
shorts
beers
this
one
was
horribly
infected
they
really
need
to
get
that
under
control
d
an
interesting
beer
i
would
like
to
see
more
oatmeal
character
come
through
personally
pretty
drinkable
all
in
all
o
glad
ive
tried
this
concoction
not
sure
i
am
going
to
be
looking
for
this
one
ever
again
except
to
foist
on
others
nevertheless
nice
try
at
it
overall
i
appreciate
the
attempt
and
the
willingness
to
experiment
but
this
was
not
my
thing
peanut
butter
tasted
somewhat
synthetic
and
out
of
place
in
the
beer
while
it
also
masked
any
other
attempt
at
creating
complexity
this
is
a
bit
of
a
novelty
that
i
can
see
people
trying
once
but
i
just
cant
imagine
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
it
was
interesting
but
its
a
oneanddone
for
me
thanks
again
thesevenduffs
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
medium
black
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
aroma
is
coffee
light
peanuts
and
dammit
there
it
is
again
the
sour
smell
that
means
for
the
second
year
in
a
row
ive
fallen
prey
to
infected
goober
taste
lightly
roasty
with
subtle
peanut
butter
and
yep
a
foul
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
unpleasantly
slick
and
lacking
in
body
god
when
will
i
frickin
learn
with
shorts
oddball
releases
overall
very
interesting
beer
some
of
shorts
beers
dont
worki
think
this
one
does
while
i
wouldnt
grab
a
six
pack
of
it
in
the
future
it
actually
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
as
stated
was
a
great
way
to
cap
the
night
after
having
such
a
sweet
fruit
beer
tasty
o
meh
mouthfeel
it
seems
rather
thin
but
the
taste
hangs
on
the
tongue
nicely
o
solid
for
me
im
a
pb
freak
so
im
definitely
in
this
beers
corner
i
thought
this
was
a
well
made
stout
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
my
friend
referred
to
uber
goober
and
reeses
peanut
butter
cups
as
the
adult
milk
and
cookies
cant
say
i
disagree
o
another
unique
idea
from
a
rather
unique
brewery
i
have
to
say
though
i
dont
think
ive
found
a
shorts
beer
that
ive
really
wanted
to
drink
again
glad
i
got
to
try
this
once
though
overall
well
it
works
interesting
mix
of
flavors
nothing
aggressive
or
offensive
couldnt
see
sitting
down
and
drinking
a
number
of
these
but
one
a
sitting
is
good
seek
it
out
for
nothing
more
than
the
novelty
works
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
with
funkydelic
and
i
at
an
impromptu
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
sampler
wine
glass
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
peanuts
salty
and
slight
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
nutty
and
subtle
saltiness
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
nothing
too
aweinspring
going
on
in
this
one
at
all
it
honestly
reminded
me
of
eating
roasted
peanuts
on
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
more
so
in
the
aroma
though
as
it
wasnt
as
salty
in
the
flavor
fortunately
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
doubt
i
would
have
it
again
d
way
too
hot
for
6
5
i
thought
it
was
a
ris
ones
enough
for
me
in
a
lifetime
o
peanut
is
in
your
face
and
authentic
my
mouth
keeps
going
back
to
ash
tray
though
overly
bitter
made
this
a
hard
one
to
choke
down
like
the
originality
but
wont
be
trying
again
d
i
finished
the
beer
but
the
sourness
was
very
offputting
i
cant
imagine
that
was
intentional
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
o
just
not
digging
this
the
peanuts
seem
gimmicky
and
i
dont
really
like
the
base
beer
the
roasted
peanuts
bring
me
back
to
my
childhood
and
eating
peanuts
at
the
old
tampa
stadium
watching
the
buccaneers
play
well
lose
with
my
father
great
memories
when
a
beer
takes
you
back
to
a
special
place
in
your
life
that
is
how
you
know
this
is
a
very
special
beer
i
will
be
hunting
more
of
this
down
overall
cool
ass
experiment
a
for
effort
but
ill
stick
with
this
one
sixer
i
think
pours
very
black
with
dark
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
there
is
no
head
but
there
is
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
very
little
lacing
that
drops
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
dark
roasted
malts
oatmeal
and
peanut
butter
very
rich
taste
of
dark
malt
roasted
oats
and
roasted
peanuts
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
in
the
taste
category
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
seen
another
beer
that
is
brewed
with
peanuts
the
mouthfeel
is
what
kills
this
one
for
me
no
carbonation
and
very
watery
on
the
palate
there
is
also
a
weird
acidity
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
another
good
and
interesting
beer
from
shorts
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
i
love
peanuts
so
this
was
something
neat
to
see
i
just
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
better
o
an
experiment
worth
a
try
possibly
blend
this
with
a
strawberry
lambic
or
framboise
i
know
shorts
does
a
pbj
which
is
also
interesting
the
last
one
i
had
held
a
bit
of
a
soury
funk
to
it
so
not
sure
it
was
100
all
together
12oz
bottle
from
rayl101
pours
near
blackdark
brown
with
thin
khaki
head
aroma
has
lots
of
peanut
peanut
shell
along
with
some
dark
chocolatecocoa
nibs
smells
very
rich
taste
is
roasty
bitter
but
the
sweet
slightly
tangy
malts
quickly
cancel
out
the
roast
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
the
finish
is
dry
but
not
overly
done
this
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
with
several
things
working
together
pretty
nicely
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
here
o
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
but
not
one
that
i
will
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
hunt
down
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
i
dont
think
it
would
ever
be
a
go
to
stout
for
me
but
it
will
be
my
go
to
peanut
stout
from
here
on
out
pours
jet
black
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dry
peanut
butter
and
sweet
oatmeal
roast
in
the
taste
a
roasted
malt
and
a
sweet
oatmeal
to
a
dry
nuttiness
a
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
to
sweet
oatmeal
in
the
aftertaste
nice
dry
nuttiness
being
balanced
with
a
sweet
oatmeal
o
interesting
brew
for
sure
glad
i
split
this
one
with
fiveo2270
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
myself
overall
fairly
meh
some
off
flavors
the
peanuts
were
interesting
but
not
great
the
acrid
and
acidic
coffee
just
kills
it
as
well
as
the
feel
that
its
lacking
some
malts
overall
a
great
stout
and
a
good
change
from
the
usual
personally
i
really
liked
the
added
roasted
peanut
taste
in
this
one
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
a
very
solid
offering
from
shorts
here
pours
an
espresso
black
with
a
dark
khaki
fingers
worth
of
head
nose
of
a
slight
acridness
and
metallic
quality
touch
of
stale
coffee
roasted
stale
peanuts
as
well
as
some
jammy
artificial
fruit
taste
is
a
sour
fruit
more
stale
coffee
and
lingering
cigarette
smoke
on
the
taste
also
pick
up
some
roasted
peanut
when
searching
for
it
easy
drinking
and
well
carbonated
for
the
style
didnt
do
this
much
of
a
favor
after
just
finishing
my
first
breakfast
stout
no
where
even
close
in
quality
o
it
wasnt
hard
to
split
this
bottle
between
my
girlfriend
and
she
definitely
liked
it
more
than
i
did
it
isnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
but
just
not
really
my
thing
my
girlfriend
did
really
enjoy
it
though
definitely
interesting
and
glad
to
try
it
o
the
idea
behind
the
brew
was
definitely
intriguing
but
as
it
stands
this
beer
fails
on
just
about
every
level
my
wife
who
i
attempted
to
share
this
brew
with
and
i
both
agree
i
couldnt
imagine
anyone
liking
this
beer
and
ive
never
said
that
before
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
very
interesting
beer
it
really
did
taste
like
a
roasty
bag
of
peanuts
i
got
a
lot
of
the
salty
earthy
peanut
shell
flavors
to
it
and
not
nearly
as
much
of
the
peanut
butter
flavor
i
expected
it
was
interesting
and
a
cool
beer
to
try
but
i
couldnt
drink
that
much
of
it
in
my
opinion
a
little
more
stout
flavors
coming
through
would
have
gone
a
long
way
it
also
felt
a
bit
salty
overall
very
cool
beer
overall
and
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
at
getting
some
real
peanut
flavor
to
come
through
i
just
dont
think
it
was
for
me
oanother
interesting
beer
from
shorts
a
lot
of
nutty
flavor
dominates
this
drink
with
some
underlying
sweetness
a
overall
easy
drink
that
is
one
worth
trying
drink
and
overall
i
think
its
solid
compared
to
other
oatmeal
stouts
like
fbs
and
wnb
it
falls
short
mostly
on
the
mouthfeel
something
went
amiss
here
it
could
be
a
problem
with
my
storage
or
possibly
a
bad
batch
from
the
brewery
the
immense
carbonation
and
slight
sourness
seem
to
indicate
an
infection
and
are
forcing
my
hand
in
pouring
this
beer
out
with
more
than
34
of
it
remaining
d
this
one
really
got
the
aroma
down
but
like
a
few
other
shorts
beers
i
feel
that
the
taste
is
a
letdown
in
comparison
having
this
next
to
the
pbj
i
felt
this
was
the
worse
of
the
two
however
when
i
blended
the
two
beers
2
parts
uber
goober
to
1
part
pbj
it
better
captured
the
peanut
flavor
that
pbj
was
lacking
while
there
was
certainly
no
shortage
of
shorts
flair
here
the
peanut
flavor
really
is
well
done
but
the
big
alcohol
presence
and
uneven
feel
kept
this
one
from
reaching
its
true
potential
i
could
have
used
a
little
less
uber
with
my
goober
here
i
think
the
cpj
fulled
medium
body
a
bit
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
was
definitely
a
little
out
there
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
if
they
wanted
to
make
a
beer
that
tasted
like
straight
up
peanut
butter
i
think
they
pretty
much
nailed
it
the
flavor
brings
mostly
peanuts
along
with
some
roast
character
and
a
mild
funk
presence
the
beer
is
well
done
albeit
another
wild
idea
from
shorts
intriguing
and
fun
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
a
small
sample
was
plenty
for
me
however
definitely
low
this
is
a
relatively
hard
to
find
beer
in
indiana
plus
youre
playing
russian
roulette
with
some
of
their
beers
i
really
hope
the
fix
their
bottling
issues
as
they
can
easily
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
will
definitely
try
this
on
tap
if
i
have
the
opportunity
pours
black
with
an
initial
faint
tan
head
which
fades
rapidly
to
nothing
no
lace
on
glass
the
nose
is
not
surprizingly
nutty
for
a
beer
made
with
peanuts
power
of
suggestion
says
peanuts
in
here
tastes
bandaidishly
plastic
with
a
brown
earthy
dirtlike
finish
kind
of
like
the
peanuts
werent
wasted
or
something
mouthfeel
is
bland
in
all
fairness
i
do
note
some
possible
interference
from
previous
glasses
overall
this
is
unique
but
would
not
seek
after
it
beer
is
a
little
thin
and
finishes
with
this
strong
peanut
shell
roast
taste
its
considerably
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
its
not
as
bad
as
most
of
the
reviews
make
it
out
to
be
you
can
definitely
tell
that
it
was
made
with
peanuts
perhaps
the
roast
of
the
peanuts
and
the
roast
of
the
grain
is
what
is
clashing
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
a
little
rough
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
d
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
once
im
not
sure
i
would
enjoy
two
or
three
in
one
sitting
seems
like
the
recipe
might
need
a
little
adjusting
to
bring
out
more
of
the
peanut
flavor
the
body
is
moderately
thick
with
carbonation
spritzing
it
up
midway
through
then
smooths
out
on
the
finish
mild
cocoa
coffee
char
and
the
faintest
of
nuttiness
sourness
is
everpresent
eh
i
dont
like
this
maybe
im
a
little
gunshy
with
these
guys
now
but
this
could
have
been
so
much
better
out
she
goes
wont
have
this
again
d
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
very
unique
i
think
the
base
beer
needs
tweaking
to
better
complement
the
peanut
drinkability
although
it
lacks
in
some
areas
its
a
good
dessert
beer
not
something
you
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
then
again
how
many
stouts
can
you
d
this
drinks
pretty
nicely
but
definitely
a
beer
id
rather
share
as
i
dont
think
peanut
is
something
i
want
in
my
everyday
oatmeal
stout
fun
to
try
but
not
a
beer
id
ever
have
back
to
back
hats
off
to
shorts
for
their
creativity
once
again
some
of
their
brews
come
off
as
novelty
but
this
is
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
fine
but
slightly
hampered
by
the
unusual
flavor
profile
im
glad
i
had
one
but
id
choose
to
follow
it
with
a
very
different
beer
a
good
effort
from
shorts
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
their
other
brews
from
now
on
d
goes
down
so
very
smoothly
for
a
stout
be
careful
with
this
one
d
its
a
really
good
beer
but
i
dont
see
drinking
more
than
12
in
a
sitting
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
drink
it
again
if
not
seek
out
as
shorts
goes
its
not
my
favorite
concept
beer
but
pretty
darn
good
all
the
same
id
actually
prefer
even
more
in
your
face
peanut
qualities
received
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
i
have
been
unimpressed
with
recent
shorts
beers
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
deep
rich
black
color
with
a
smallish
brown
head
smells
a
lot
like
peanut
butter
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
creamy
medium
bodied
with
a
definite
peanut
presence
along
with
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
drinkability
i
took
a
few
sips
and
moved
on
thought
to
my
self
i
was
thankful
it
was
only
12oz
i
am
a
bit
over
these
weird
shorts
beers
p
s
on
a
side
note
on
my
recent
visit
to
the
brewpub
i
bought
a
growler
of
this
beer
and
it
was
listed
as
9abv
on
the
beer
board
so
perhaps
this
may
reflect
the
most
recent
brewing
d
i
dont
really
want
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
wouldnt
seek
out
again
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
but
doubt
id
pay
for
it
uber
goober
is
an
interesting
stout
it
has
an
oily
feel
and
look
its
very
wellbalanced
and
not
too
sweet
or
strong
a
good
tasting
and
creative
beer
delicious
gotta
give
shorts
credit
for
experimenting
but
this
one
is
slightly
off
the
mark
overall
this
was
one
different
kick
ass
beer
i
thought
the
peanuts
worked
very
well
with
the
roasted
malts
i
would
for
sure
get
this
beer
again
shorts
continues
to
blow
my
mind
with
their
crazy
concoctions
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
d
glad
to
try
it
but
one
is
enough
for
me
i
like
the
shorts
beers
they
are
not
for
everyone
but
i
like
it
when
breweries
are
trying
different
things
this
would
never
be
a
go
to
for
me
but
decent
little
snack
for
what
it
is
its
tasty
id
drink
it
again
cocoa
coffee
and
pie
crust
back
it
up
amazing
it
sort
of
tastes
like
a
lightly
sweetened
peanut
butter
pie
but
it
is
rather
meager
compared
to
the
aroma
i
cant
be
too
disappointed
what
do
you
expect
legumes
aside
it
is
a
good
stout
a
little
molasses
burnt
sugar
neutral
hops
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
about
oats
only
being
for
body
i
can
taste
oats
there
is
some
taste
familiar
in
every
oatmeal
stout
including
this
one
that
being
said
the
mouthfeel
does
not
quite
have
the
depth
and
roundness
but
it
aint
bad
either
pours
black
smells
like
an
oatmeal
stout
with
the
faintest
touch
of
peanuts
maybe
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
the
taste
is
ok
finishes
with
peanuts
and
starts
with
a
mediocre
oatmeal
stout
would
be
easily
ignored
if
it
wasnt
at
least
interesting
moderate
drinkability
but
the
peanut
flavor
just
isnt
smoothly
added
to
a
well
made
oatmeal
stout
instead
the
peanut
flavor
sits
at
the
back
and
unintegrated
into
a
blasé
stout
overall
without
a
lot
of
bold
overpowering
flavors
in
this
beer
combined
with
the
low
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
it
finishes
clean
as
well
poured
to
a
one
inch
head
that
didnt
hang
around
very
long
had
a
little
lacing
going
on
but
not
much
brew
itself
was
almost
black
in
color
left
some
settlement
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
smelled
of
peanuts
coffee
chocolate
and
malt
also
was
sweet
smelling
tasted
of
strong
chocolatecoffee
malt
and
had
a
peanut
aftertaste
no
taste
of
alcohol
felt
good
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
right
had
to
much
chocolate
for
me
actually
thought
it
was
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
for
my
liking
drinkability
was
great
this
was
tasty
a
little
different
but
2
were
plenty
for
me
in
one
sitting
as
the
brew
is
pretty
solid
another
brew
from
the
mad
scientists
of
food
based
beers
i
hope
to
someday
travel
and
visit
the
brewpub
very
nice
job
shorts
i
think
shorts
got
what
they
were
shooting
for
here
almost
perfectly
d
this
beer
was
a
treat
great
flavors
would
enthusiastically
recommend
i
found
this
to
be
rather
enjoyable
i
like
peanuts
i
like
oatmeal
stouts
i
really
like
peanuts
in
my
oatmeal
stout
i
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
poured
black
with
caramelcolored
edges
but
almost
no
head
at
all
and
only
a
few
minor
scraps
of
lacing
smell
is
definitely
dominated
by
peanut
butter
with
a
faint
note
of
roasted
grains
and
some
malty
sweetness
supporting
it
its
a
very
enjoyable
scent
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
appropriately
buttery
and
chewy
and
the
oily
body
feels
full
in
the
mouth
but
vanishes
a
little
disappointingly
quickly
on
swallowing
causing
you
to
realize
its
thinner
than
it
first
tasted
the
peanut
flavors
are
very
present
in
the
overall
coating
left
in
the
mouth
but
they
come
into
the
flavor
profile
late
offering
rich
velvety
tone
instead
of
bombastic
sweetness
which
actually
impresses
me
as
i
dont
necessarily
expect
that
kind
of
restraint
in
a
shorts
on
the
downside
its
a
trifle
watery
and
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
more
to
the
flavor
profile
beyond
some
mild
basic
stout
characteristics
e
g
some
chocolate
notes
a
charred
quality
and
a
very
mild
maltyseeming
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
that
could
be
a
subdued
hop
bite
drinkability
is
exceptionally
high
and
like
most
people
i
love
peanut
butter
as
a
flavor
so
its
really
easy
to
enjoy
this
one
its
not
quite
complex
or
bold
enough
to
be
a
fullblown
a
but
its
probably
the
most
pleasantly
drinkable
shorts
beer
ive
yet
to
try
id
give
it
a
b
on
my
own
but
the
ba
calculator
tallies
it
out
as
an
a
d
once
again
shorts
does
it
for
me
they
are
the
masters
of
brewing
funky
beers
that
deliver
what
they
say
they
will
the
abv
like
all
their
beers
are
hidden
well
enough
that
you
dont
notice
it
until
its
too
late
super
drinkable
and
putting
down
a
six
pack
of
this
is
very
easy
to
do
beer
pours
nicely
into
beer
mug
the
brownish
black
bodied
brew
has
a
thin
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
moderate
carbonation
and
excellent
lacing
that
looks
nice
on
the
side
of
the
mug
the
smell
is
very
much
a
roasted
smell
of
coffee
peanuts
and
some
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
peanuts
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
caramel
some
hops
and
the
ending
taste
is
of
coffee
it
has
a
little
bit
of
bitter
in
the
taste
but
mostly
has
a
sweeter
taste
to
it
that
is
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
creamy
taste
that
has
a
nice
medium
to
full
body
to
this
beer
the
smoothness
of
this
oatmeal
stout
makes
this
a
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
great
beer
and
a
must
try
worth
giving
a
shot
if
you
like
peanut
butter
cant
say
anything
wonderful
things
about
how
real
the
aroma
is
just
doesnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
which
wouldnt
be
bad
if
was
tastey
itself
but
its
not
joe
short
wants
you
to
think
when
you
drink
he
wants
you
to
think
about
how
his
beers
work
when
common
sense
says
it
never
will
he
wants
you
to
think
about
why
no
one
has
done
this
before
ok
maybe
that
is
just
what
i
am
thinking
when
i
drink
his
beers
but
i
am
sure
he
would
appreciate
the
thought
uber
goober
is
a
very
good
beer
not
a
session
beer
but
on
i
would
not
think
twice
about
a
repeat
one
worth
seeking
out
poured
from
bottle
into
imperial
pint
glass
as
dark
as
dark
can
be
with
very
little
head
a
dark
tan
almost
copper
colored
ring
hugs
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
what
makes
this
beer
in
my
opinion
its
like
chocolate
covered
peanuts
roasted
in
coffee
taste
is
not
too
far
behind
malt
and
peanuts
taking
center
stage
as
it
coats
the
tongue
adequately
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
doesnt
cloy
or
bore
but
you
better
like
peanuts
i
would
recommend
this
to
peanut
lovers
and
stout
lovers
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
light
tan
head
the
nose
really
does
bring
some
peanut
character
through
with
a
bit
of
mild
bread
behind
that
taste
is
light
peanut
and
not
too
much
else
they
hit
the
concept
but
it
just
doesnt
do
all
that
much
for
me
the
feel
is
nice
and
a
bit
creamy
really
bringing
the
flavor
forward
which
is
good
as
there
really
isnt
a
terrible
amount
of
flavor
there
drinks
fairly
well
but
is
one
dimensional
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
quite
nice
consisting
of
peanut
butter
slight
coffee
chocolate
and
booze
notes
the
flavor
caught
me
by
surprise
cause
it
seems
like
it
is
infected
due
to
the
sour
character
it
has
on
the
palate
it
did
have
the
peanut
butter
and
choclate
notes
but
i
dont
think
the
tart
sourness
is
intentional
there
was
also
a
little
booze
and
coffee
notes
as
well
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
tart
and
boozy
finish
it
did
not
drink
that
good
due
to
the
sour
character
on
this
oatmeal
stout
usaully
i
expect
some
creaminess
from
this
sytle
well
too
bad
man
this
is
really
too
bad
i
can
almost
taste
a
really
excellent
incredibly
unique
beer
underneath
the
critters
whove
fouled
all
over
the
goober
if
shorts
makes
this
beer
again
id
be
happy
to
try
it
very
very
fresh
right
now
though
not
good
two
drain
pours
in
a
row
this
was
a
one
and
done
for
me
same
as
many
shorts
beers
they
try
a
lot
of
odd
things
but
huma
lupa
licious
is
the
only
one
i
return
to
regularly
i
want
to
like
shorts
but
until
they
get
their
sanitation
under
control
i
wont
be
trading
for
any
more
of
their
beers
d
goes
down
alright
mild
kick
somewhat
balanced
pairs
far
better
with
food
than
on
its
own
not
one
to
sit
with
for
the
night
but
a
beer
to
have
with
dinner
pouring
black
with
ample
tan
head
into
a
tulip
glass
this
brew
smells
like
roasted
malts
and
roasted
peanuts
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
more
peanuty
flavor
there
is
some
bitter
chocolate
in
here
too
tastes
a
bit
like
the
beer
version
of
a
reeses
peanut
butter
cup
to
me
and
that
i
like
somewhat
boozy
for
6
5
and
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
really
creative
effort
d
i
am
one
and
done
with
this
one
i
love
shorts
and
always
will
support
this
is
one
of
my
lesser
favorites
but
props
need
to
go
to
shorts
for
inventive
style
and
venture
d
i
think
this
one
might
be
infected
hope
its
infected
drain
pour
overall
a
disappointing
beer
from
a
brewery
that
is
usually
a
sure
thing
d
the
flavor
here
is
just
not
appealing
i
love
shorts
brewing
for
trying
something
interesting
and
unique
but
this
does
not
do
it
for
me
bottle
from
the
new
6pack
seasonal
tremendous
roast
aroma
black
with
fabulous
brown
head
carbonation
is
right
there
the
taste
is
very
sour
i
cannot
imagine
that
this
is
intentional
yes
peanut
yes
stout
but
sour
above
average
mouthfeel
but
sour
is
one
step
backward
for
me
one
big
step
backward
for
the
masses
inky
black
with
a
dense
brown
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
leaving
no
lace
this
is
solid
stuff
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
lactic
sourness
this
is
quite
terribly
infected
with
a
blend
of
nice
roast
ground
peanuts
and
the
sourness
and
an
ashy
character
the
palate
is
intensely
sour
undrinkably
so
and
this
from
a
sourhead
the
heavy
infection
washes
out
all
the
other
flavors
drying
and
fruity
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
bitterness
this
is
rather
awful
light
in
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
this
isnt
even
close
to
good
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
though
d
not
quite
a
drain
pour
the
sour
flavors
become
more
evident
the
warmer
the
ale
gets
get
it
cold
and
the
start
and
end
are
good
d
honestly
its
not
god
awful
id
have
this
over
a
bmc
but
two
infected
beers
in
a
row
doesnt
reflect
well
on
shorts
unfortunately
for
them
the
poor
review
reflects
their
mistake
and
i
look
forward
to
having
a
good
bottle
hopefully
lots
of
tight
carbonation
up
front
and
it
is
slightly
infectedoxidizes
with
lots
of
sweetness
and
slight
tart
flavor
there
are
some
nice
silky
chocolate
notes
that
are
slightly
roasted
prominent
oatmeal
presence
along
with
some
toffee
and
licorice
and
a
smooth
slightly
creamy
roasted
peanut
favor
blah
sour
tart
and
tangy
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
oatmeal
stout
this
is
infected
and
the
beer
is
ruined
beware
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
drain
pour
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
and
the
potency
to
the
taste
make
it
good
but
make
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
as
time
progresses
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
too
surprised
given
some
of
the
recent
reviews
on
this
one
but
i
still
had
my
hopes
up
this
one
is
definitely
infected
with
a
sourness
in
the
taste
that
seriously
limits
the
drinkability
need
to
find
a
growler
of
this
one
to
get
a
better
idea
of
the
real
intent
drinkability
is
average
i
like
what
they
did
here
and
appreciate
the
fact
that
its
probably
tough
to
add
peanuts
without
getting
the
beer
infected
in
some
way
my
advice
is
to
drink
this
as
fresh
as
possible
if
you
have
this
beer
already
drink
it
now
before
it
gets
even
worse
if
you
dont
have
it
yet
dont
bother
searching
for
it
hopefully
this
gets
rereleased
in
the
future
so
i
can
give
it
another
shot
overall
this
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
this
was
simply
an
excellent
stout
and
something
i
could
drink
several
of
in
row
with
ease
another
unique
brew
from
a
brewery
that
does
some
great
different
things
with
beer
got
this
bottle
courtesy
of
telix
pours
out
dark
almost
black
with
a
two
finger
peanut
shell
colored
head
that
quickly
fizzles
out
the
nose
is
exactly
what
the
bottle
has
promised
an
oatmeal
stout
with
peanuts
the
peanut
aroma
isnt
overpowering
but
it
is
pleasantly
noticeable
in
the
background
unfortunately
the
peanuts
dont
have
the
same
effect
in
the
taste
the
flavor
of
the
roasted
oats
are
overpowered
by
the
salty
oily
quality
of
the
peanuts
there
is
only
a
hint
of
peanut
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
oily
and
overall
a
little
lacking
the
peanuts
make
the
beer
bitter
and
hard
to
drink
i
didnt
know
exactly
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
was
somehow
disappointed
uber
goober
is
an
interesting
idea
but
i
think
they
flat
out
used
too
many
peanuts
for
my
particular
tastes
i
love
the
stuff
when
its
used
in
pbj
as
the
soft
parade
cuts
the
peanut
characteristics
down
to
a
dull
roar
and
makes
the
stuff
much
more
enjoyable
for
me
by
itself
though
no
thanks
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
well
worth
the
experience
though
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
keep
on
hand
would
not
recommend
more
than
one
at
a
time
it
would
be
quite
fun
to
have
at
a
tasting
and
a
good
example
of
a
strong
oatmeal
stout
picked
up
a
bottle
over
xmas
when
i
was
in
the
detroit
area
this
ones
truly
black
only
the
faintest
of
brown
edges
appears
when
you
really
squint
a
dense
mocha
head
appeared
during
the
pour
and
refused
to
go
away
even
after
the
glass
was
empty
chunky
lacing
almost
streaky
covered
the
glass
nice
aroma
you
can
smell
the
peanuts
for
sure
pleasant
roast
earthy
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
fruit
faint
licorice
and
cherry
now
this
is
a
sweet
stout
lots
of
lactose
and
malt
roast
chocolate
nuts
raisins
and
a
bit
of
berry
sourness
in
the
finish
bitterness
was
present
throughout
but
was
fairly
restrained
the
peanuts
are
there
but
arent
overpowering
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
pretty
smooth
and
silky
for
such
a
sweet
beer
this
didnt
feel
unbalanced
at
all
just
enough
bitterness
and
a
fruity
tartness
kept
it
all
in
check
good
stuff
d
certainly
an
interesting
idea
for
a
stout
most
of
it
works
well
together
however
it
does
get
a
little
disjointed
sometimes
it
doesnt
quite
know
what
to
taste
like
its
sometimes
boozy
or
its
really
bitter
or
its
creamy
certainly
dynamic
unpredictable
in
character
but
not
necessarily
what
i
would
look
for
in
a
stout
good
but
it
has
it
quirks
not
very
drinkable
either
due
to
its
moody
character
it
is
apparent
that
real
peanuts
were
used
there
is
a
big
difference
between
real
whole
peanuts
and
fake
sweetened
oily
peanut
butter
unfortunately
the
drinkability
was
slightly
low
for
me
but
that
isnt
to
say
this
beer
shouldnt
be
tried
the
uniqueness
alone
is
worth
everything
poured
a
beautiful
silky
black
with
a
6inch
dense
tancolored
creamy
head
that
settled
ever
so
slowly
the
nose
suggests
dark
roast
and
sour
notes
with
a
strong
hint
of
peanuts
and
oatmeal
cookies
if
i
had
tasted
this
blind
i
would
have
suggested
it
was
a
mediumbodied
farmhouse
ale
with
a
snappy
finish
this
is
tasty
and
fun
unexpected
but
delicious
very
welldeveloped
belgian
lace
forms
and
stays
put
the
stout
lingers
with
definite
peanut
oatmeal
and
chocolate
notes
excellent
at
cellar
temperature
chilling
further
would
restrain
the
expressive
nature
of
this
stout
shorts
brewing
is
brewing
some
interesting
beer
must
get
back
to
the
store
to
see
what
else
they
have
made
d
perhaps
im
simply
a
victim
of
the
interesting
factor
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
i
really
love
peanut
butter
and
while
it
wasnt
as
peanutbuttery
as
i
would
have
liked
it
still
was
a
nice
beer
overall
uber
goober
was
for
me
a
unique
brew
i
really
liked
the
aroma
of
this
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
wonder
if
some
time
in
the
bottle
would
smooth
things
out
and
integrate
the
flavors
a
little
better
the
combo
of
roasted
malt
coffee
flavors
just
didnt
go
well
with
the
tart
finish
on
this
beer
for
me
really
fun
beer
to
try
high
points
on
creativity
but
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
too
often
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
loved
the
peanuts
and
i
cant
wait
for
the
pb
j
pretty
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
why
the
label
says
it
is
imperial
at
the
abv
it
has
i
am
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
however
i
wish
the
sourness
didnt
affect
it
so
much
d
another
great
new
shorts
brew
we
actually
preferred
pbj
because
of
the
presence
of
the
j
but
this
was
excellent
in
its
own
right
drinkability
is
nice
this
isnt
a
hokey
flavored
beer
as
i
feared
its
a
great
shot
at
a
unique
flavor
profile
and
shorts
should
be
proud
of
this
and
their
other
new
offerings
pours
a
dark
brown
color
but
is
completely
black
in
the
tulip
glass
with
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
roasty
aromas
of
blackened
malt
some
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
peanuts
flavor
is
very
interesting
tastes
roasty
at
first
light
coffee
caramel
and
toast
turns
to
roasted
peanuts
in
the
middle
which
i
must
say
is
perfectly
integrated
into
the
beer
without
becoming
too
cloying
and
a
smooth
chocolaty
finish
very
interesting
stuff
medium
full
bodied
light
carbonation
but
who
knows
that
could
be
from
the
bottle
freezing
and
thawing
a
good
stout
and
using
peanuts
gave
it
an
interesting
twist
overall
another
good
beer
from
shorts
very
unique
and
well
executed
as
expected
from
this
great
brewery
not
my
favorite
beer
from
them
but
i
certainly
hope
that
they
continue
bottling
it
into
the
future
i
drank
one
of
these
on
two
separate
occasions
each
time
i
felt
this
beer
had
a
higher
abv
than
6
5
i
called
shorts
and
the
girl
on
the
phone
said
the
2009
batch
is
8
7
abv
dit
drinks
really
well
especially
considering
the
9
abv
the
booze
is
certainly
masked
by
the
peanuts
and
this
makes
for
a
really
great
imperial
stout
d
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
and
i
think
i
could
only
enjoy
one
in
a
sitting
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
pbj
its
chewy
moderately
carbonated
and
a
pure
pleasure
to
drink
dark
chocolate
brown
body
small
bubbly
dark
sandy
head
some
lacing
nose
is
an
intriguing
mix
of
chocolate
syrup
dark
fruits
roasted
coffee
and
peanut
butter
they
all
mix
together
very
nicely
which
isnt
that
surprising
roasted
malts
and
peanut
butter
flavors
up
front
light
roasted
coffee
mixes
in
along
with
a
flourish
of
sweetish
dark
fruits
slightly
medicinalboozy
twang
as
well
roasted
finish
with
lingering
dark
fruits
and
hints
of
the
dark
chocolatepeanut
butter
combo
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
the
only
peanut
beer
ive
ever
had
that
actually
showed
some
peanut
butter
on
the
nose
and
the
palate
nicely
done
i
dont
know
about
this
one
ive
had
two
bottles
of
it
and
i
just
cant
like
it
and
i
cant
pick
up
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
others
are
picking
up
i
dont
know
if
maybe
my
bottles
are
bad
but
ill
keep
trying
it
and
if
it
gets
any
better
ill
be
sure
to
update
my
review
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
standard
for
an
oatmeal
stout
low
carbonation
and
a
tad
chewy
another
winner
from
shorts
but
i
was
slightly
disappointed
in
this
one
d
this
is
actually
pretty
relaxing
and
drinkable
the
recipe
could
use
a
bit
of
tweaking
but
who
else
would
even
think
to
make
a
peanutbased
oatmeal
stout
if
it
was
just
a
touch
sweeter
id
like
it
more
i
think
its
funny
these
limited
edition
shorts
releases
are
going
to
get
at
least
bs
across
the
board
but
so
far
are
unimpressive
d
a
must
have
for
any
fan
of
both
peanuts
and
stouts
a
one
of
a
kind
brew
that
is
both
tasty
and
well
produced
worth
seeking
out
d
i
prefer
mystery
and
cup
a
joe
to
this
one
not
bad
very
interesting
beer
in
that
shorts
really
did
incorporate
a
peanut
butter
flavor
and
aroma
but
the
booziness
and
charred
malt
flavors
keep
it
from
being
outstanding
for
me
overall
an
interesting
beer
because
of
the
peanut
flavor
d
with
the
smooth
mouthfeel
this
one
goes
down
easy
not
really
much
alcohol
for
an
imperial
oatmeal
stout
as
the
bottle
claims
but
what
alcohol
there
is
is
well
well
hidden
shorts
really
did
a
nice
job
with
uber
goober
it
comes
across
as
advertised
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
all
three
of
the
special
stouts
that
shorts
has
just
brought
out
mystery
cup
a
joe
and
this
one
cheers
this
is
a
solid
and
creative
brew
by
shorts
pick
one
up
if
you
have
the
chance
drinkability
is
good
pretty
well
balanced
with
just
a
little
alcohol
warmth
showing
through
i
like
the
extra
depth
from
the
peanut
and
chocolate
characters
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
goes
down
pretty
smooth
even
though
sweet
it
isnt
overly
sweet
thanks
a
ton
derek
dquite
nice
and
certainly
unique
would
have
liked
more
of
a
fresh
peanut
quality
but
the
dry
roasted
flavour
works
better
with
the
malts
a
very
interesting
and
well
done
brew
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
an
averaged
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
roast
some
lighter
oatiness
nutty
chocolate
and
smokey
peanuts
tastes
of
roast
chocolate
oats
and
nutty
i
like
the
way
the
peanuts
were
done
and
presented
themselves
in
this
beer
this
is
a
one
of
a
kind
original
i
would
encourage
anyone
to
give
this
beer
a
try
its
definitely
worth
it
