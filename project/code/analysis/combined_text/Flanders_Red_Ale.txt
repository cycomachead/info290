this
had
the
perfect
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
o
this
is
a
sour
from
upland
i
can
unequivocally
get
behind
takes
the
classic
flanders
red
and
turns
it
to
11
but
without
destroying
the
fundamental
qualities
of
the
original
big
fat
sour
notes
fruits
and
oak
this
is
as
epic
as
its
name
suggests
excellent
dark
ruby
color
with
tan
head
that
lingered
lots
of
lingering
lacing
as
well
aromas
of
oak
sour
fruit
guessing
cherries
with
more
sour
notes
tastes
much
the
same
sour
cherry
with
overtones
of
oak
and
acidic
flavors
little
touch
of
vanilla
maybe
bourbon
very
complex
and
balanced
drinkable
moderate
carbonation
abv
hidden
extremely
well
kind
of
beer
that
can
sneak
up
and
knock
you
out
this
was
aged
about
6
months
and
it
was
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
adds
a
dimension
to
this
beer
that
most
flanders
do
not
have
the
barrel
warmth
and
whiskey
flavors
mellow
what
would
otherwise
be
a
very
sour
beer
to
make
a
more
drinkable
end
product
wow
what
a
tasty
flanders
red
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
light
head
this
is
a
sour
though
good
carb
and
a
great
tart
sour
upfront
but
has
that
clear
belgian
aftertaste
lovely
full
body
as
well
and
the
bourbon
aroma
and
nose
is
excellent
solid
solid
beer
aftertaste
is
probably
the
only
place
id
be
a
critic
the
best
take
on
a
flanders
red
i
have
had
truly
epic
this
was
a
bottle
from
2010
it
tasted
as
if
the
sour
had
gone
away
and
started
to
come
back
around
very
wellbalanced
beer
that
is
worth
the
patience
thoroughly
enjoyed
o
extremely
smooth
and
mellow
very
impressed
age
has
done
this
well
very
delicious
thanks
again
mark
overall
this
is
a
palate
wrecker
of
a
sour
its
good
but
its
strong
o
4
25
my
favorite
sour
to
date
a
great
blend
of
flavors
brings
this
one
together
very
nicely
o
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
flanders
red
ale
the
list
is
short
in
this
category
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
that
i
like
is
much
rodenbach
red
poppy
oude
tart
i
have
no
idea
where
the
10
5
is
hiding
and
i
seriously
doubt
that
it
is
actually
up
there
that
high
this
went
above
and
beyond
my
expectations
another
winner
from
upland
o
a
really
nice
flemishredish
beer
the
subtle
fruit
and
barrel
flavors
are
great
this
was
my
first
sour
from
upland
and
was
very
impressed
4
25
d
its
not
packing
a
whole
lot
in
the
sourness
category
but
it
tastes
great
and
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
or
hard
to
get
you
could
drink
it
all
night
and
be
quite
happy
thanks
duels
for
the
opportunity
othe
best
upland
sour
ive
had
so
far
perfectly
balanced
a
tad
more
carbonation
would
make
this
a
lot
better
although
they
might
have
to
change
the
name
due
to
some
lawyery
stuff
the
ale
was
poured
into
a
sampler
glass
and
was
a
darkish
ruby
red
in
appearance
it
produced
a
head
that
was
offwhite
in
appearance
the
initial
taste
was
sour
but
not
overly
vinegary
some
flanders
ales
make
me
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
bottle
of
worchester
sauce
the
acidity
did
not
take
away
from
the
taste
tart
berry
notes
balance
the
acidity
nicely
as
the
ale
moved
toward
the
aftertaste
one
detects
a
hint
of
woodiness
from
barrel
aging
tart
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
gave
it
a
little
staying
power
and
even
allowed
for
a
mild
warming
sensation
overall
this
was
a
treat
to
try
it
was
sweeter
than
i
usually
like
my
sours
but
it
seemed
to
work
well
here
d
this
is
much
better
than
the
bottle
i
tried
at
fobab
a
year
back
i
also
liked
this
a
bit
better
than
the
green
flash
effort
which
was
also
a
flanderstype
beer
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
really
sneaky
with
the
booze
which
is
dangerous
as
this
goes
down
quite
easily
medium
body
upper
level
carbonation
somehow
juicy
and
dry
on
the
tongue
with
a
lasting
finish
im
a
fan
of
aging
sour
ales
in
bourbon
barrels
and
upland
really
nailed
this
one
id
definitely
be
interested
in
finding
another
bottle
o
very
nice
flanders
but
not
my
favorite
nice
beer
the
sourness
level
is
stronger
than
the
fruit
lambics
from
upland
and
the
bourbon
barrels
add
some
nice
depth
ive
opened
three
bottles
of
this
one
roughly
6
months
ago
another
3
months
ago
and
another
last
night
each
bottle
has
gotten
progressively
better
and
more
sour
this
one
still
might
not
even
be
at
its
peak
yet
exciting
stuff
o
overall
very
tart
sour
cherries
nice
flanders
but
very
much
on
the
sour
end
of
the
spectrum
m
slippery
and
slick
subdued
acidity
very
nicely
balanced
for
10
5
abv
a
topoftheline
beer
be
sure
of
it
not
the
best
but
pretty
damn
impressive
it
ranks
high
amongst
the
style
a
bourbonbarrel
aged
flanders
red
how
can
i
not
recommend
it
i
cant
think
of
anything
to
compare
this
one
to
but
im
loving
it
very
interesting
brew
thats
worth
seeking
out
this
was
a
bitch
to
open
required
the
lobster
claw
cracker
to
pull
the
cork
but
it
cam
with
a
loud
pop
pours
a
brown
ale
with
cherry
hues
and
a
good
broken
sheet
of
light
cream
foam
smells
of
sweet
balsamics
some
brown
sugar
and
some
oak
there
is
the
vinegar
tone
indicating
the
tart
quality
but
the
nose
lacks
depth
for
me
flavor
has
a
nice
tartness
cherries
oak
hint
of
bourbon
slightly
bitter
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
i
like
the
balance
in
this
one
medium
bodied
with
lower
carb
and
a
dry
finish
nice
beer
the
nose
does
not
match
the
flavor
but
it
is
a
nice
beer
o
this
flanders
resides
on
the
sweeter
side
but
has
enough
tartness
to
allow
it
to
be
called
a
sour
the
cherry
is
definitely
the
prominent
flavor
with
the
oak
and
lemon
adding
a
level
of
complexity
very
approachable
and
would
be
a
nice
introduction
into
sours
bottle
split
amongst
a
few
friends
excited
to
try
a
sour
style
beer
from
upland
it
pours
a
redorange
color
with
haziness
the
nose
of
it
contains
red
wine
vinegar
cherry
and
sugar
a
very
interesting
beer
so
far
it
tastes
nice
a
mix
of
sour
bourbon
cherry
good
mix
of
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
acidic
to
be
sure
leaves
you
with
a
bit
of
sour
face
a
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
your
time
o
really
good
flanders
brew
and
was
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
a
bourbon
barreled
flanders
light
to
medium
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
the
alcohol
very
well
hidden
flavors
arent
too
bold
though
a
great
sour
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
the
barrel
aging
but
it
adds
a
nice
subtle
component
very
well
done
pours
a
rather
dark
redamber
color
without
much
in
the
way
of
head
formation
or
carbonation
a
bit
more
bourbon
and
vanilla
than
expected
some
definite
acetic
qualities
with
some
red
wine
vinegar
and
dark
fruits
a
little
caramel
sweetness
too
like
the
nose
sweet
toffeecaramel
and
barrel
notes
bourbon
and
vanilla
the
sourness
picks
up
as
it
warms
and
the
vinegar
is
able
to
come
through
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
batch
date
of
911
stamped
on
the
back
label
served
in
a
unibroue
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
murky
reddishamber
color
with
an
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
vinegar
tart
and
sweet
cherries
wood
green
sour
apples
funk
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
tart
and
sweet
cherries
vinegar
lemon
peel
funk
wood
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
bourbon
flavor
isnt
strong
in
this
brew
at
all
but
i
think
the
subtle
bourbon
taste
works
well
with
the
tartness
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
syrupy
and
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
pretty
nice
overall
brew
yeah
it
was
24
99
a
bottle
but
after
drinking
it
i
dont
feel
like
i
paid
too
much
for
it
good
thing
i
bought
2
bottles
this
one
was
a
part
of
cmrillos
40
beers
40
birthday
bash
shared
by
myself
a
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
aasher
for
sending
me
this
one
as
a
part
of
a
get
well
back
after
i
first
returned
to
work
and
was
fighting
my
literally
through
physical
therapy
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
ruby
red
orange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
tart
and
subtle
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cherry
tart
sour
wood
cherry
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
a
nice
followup
to
the
5050
eclipses
we
had
previously
it
did
a
nice
job
of
cleansing
the
palate
and
still
shining
through
with
all
its
glory
the
flavor
was
my
favorite
part
as
it
was
quite
complex
and
very
well
balance
a
definite
must
try
regardless
if
you
have
done
so
or
not
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
woody
and
slight
vinegar
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
woody
and
acidic
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
am
not
getting
any
hints
of
bourbon
in
the
aroma
or
taste

d
good

the
complexity
seemed
to
improve
as
i
moved
through
this
one
and
the
backendaftertaste
here
is
quite
good
top
notch
craftsmanship
though
id
expect
nothing
less
from
an
upland
reserve
beer
wish
i
had
another
bottle
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
fills
the
sour
void
in
my
life
tart
complex
and
totally
delicious
overall
another
really
good
sour
by
upland
only
had
a
few
flanders
red
but
i
do
enjoy
the
beer
style
very
tasty
flemish
red
although
im
not
picking
up
a
lot
if
barrel
notes
worth
a
try
thanks
4daloveofstout
the
beer
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
as
well
as
some
tart
cherries
and
oak
notes
the
flavor
is
similar
with
some
lightly
tart
cherries
oak
leather
and
vanilla
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
flandersstyle
ale
and
tremendous
sour
the
fact
that
the
bourbon
barrels
used
to
treat
this
beer
were
previously
used
for
another
brew
shows
as
i
had
a
hard
time
finding
any
bourbon
notes
the
faint
vanilla
and
overall
woodiness
seem
to
be
the
dominant
contributions
from
the
barrel
treatment
ultimately
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
and
would
say
its
worth
the
effort
to
seek
out
o
ah
that
bourbon
barrel
aging
does
a
world
of
good
for
this
beer
it
mellows
out
an
already
supersour
beer
and
because
of
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
flanders
ales
ive
ever
had
what
every
brewer
should
aspire
to
when
it
comes
to
sour
beer
definitely
worth
the
money
in
fact
i
think
ill
go
buy
another
o
a
nice
take
on
the
flanders
style
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
this
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
for
a
year
the
bourbon
notes
are
very
tame
but
they
do
mesh
well
with
the
softness
of
the
bugs
and
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
very
good
wild
ale
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
the
nose
has
a
very
nice
mix
of
bourbon
and
sour
dark
fruits
whilt
eh
taste
is
funkier
and
sourer
which
i
love
one
of
the
better
upland
sours
so
far
and
pretty
interesting
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
it
overall
a
decent
flanders
but
nothing
too
crazy
enjoyable
however
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
the
grand
scale
of
the
flavors
and
the
combination
of
layers
was
well
integrated
and
the
final
product
shows
that
a
very
large
abv
but
as
mentioned
well
hidden
a
good
beer
to
share
with
a
good
drinking
buddy
a
well
done
style
that
isnt
normally
done
in
the
states
good
to
see
a
craft
brewer
in
america
taking
a
shot
i
would
love
another
bottle
to
sit
on
but
the
experience
was
good
for
me
this
beer
is
perfect
by
itself
but
it
would
compliment
a
cherry
sauce
braised
pork
chop
like
nobodys
business
my
next
bottle
is
on
the
menu
cant
wait
again
upland
incredibly
impressive
you
nailed
this
beer
and
you
nailed
the
style
legit
flanders
reds
in
indiana
whodathunkit
the
beer
is
brown
to
ruby
hued
with
an
off
white
head
that
leaves
sparse
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
offers
fruit
particularly
cherries
oak
and
a
healthy
dose
of
booze
powerful
flavor
with
a
strong
showing
from
both
the
booze
and
fruit
plenty
of
tartness
and
a
bold
acetic
finish
impressive
this
exceeded
my
expectations
would
be
very
happy
to
try
this
one
again
recommended
overall
this
is
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
but
a
little
expensive
the
bourbon
isnt
very
noticeable
so
perhaps
the
base
beer
was
stronger
than
i
anticipated
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
for
25
its
a
little
expensive
for
what
it
is
if
yourea
big
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
must
try
4
55
overall
this
was
a
very
well
rounded
beer
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
didnt
wow
me
like
others
of
the
style
i
dont
feel
the
bourbon
added
enough
flavor
here
to
be
called
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
flanders
red
maybe
not
enough
contact
time
or
the
base
beer
was
too
big
or
the
bugs
are
still
slowly
eating
away
at
the
sweet
bourbony
flavors
who
knows
good
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
o
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
think
some
age
will
do
this
one
some
good
and
smooth
the
booze
out
further
which
would
be
nice
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
in
6
months
or
so
if
you
like
red
poppy
and
want
some
more
alcohol
in
there
this
beer
is
for
you
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
mildly
sweet
and
liquor
on
the
front
portion
of
the
palate
nad
the
finish
is
lactic
succinic
and
acetic
with
a
little
brightness
there
nice
beer
overall
hard
for
me
to
put
this
in
the
flanders
red
box
with
the
forward
palate
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
good
upland
offering
they
keep
getting
better
and
better
medium
body
with
a
slight
bit
of
booze
but
not
nearly
that
10
5
that
is
listed
good
acidity
coming
through
after
a
medium
body
that
created
a
nice
malt
base
perhaps
my
favorite
upland
sour
to
date
o
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
blows
away
marron
acidifie
for
sure
and
id
venture
to
say
i
like
it
better
than
oerbier
riserva
i
love
flanders
reds
and
the
bourbon
adds
a
unique
twist
to
this
classic
i
was
afraid
the
bourbon
would
be
overpowering
but
it
really
is
delicate
and
subtle
making
it
work
o
for
me
this
is
the
best
beer
upland
has
pushed
out
i
personally
love
this
style
and
i
really
think
they
nailed
it
the
flavors
expected
for
the
style
are
on
point
the
finish
is
great
i
actually
think
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
is
what
sets
this
apart
from
other
flanders
red
this
instantly
stormed
into
the
top
3
for
the
style
in
my
book
decent
aroma
very
nice
fruity
and
quite
tart
flavor
minimal
funk
lacks
the
complexity
including
the
offnotes
of
some
belgian
versions
bright
glowing
cherry
red
color
no
head
seems
to
be
a
theme
with
sour
beers
aroma
is
fantastic
sweet
and
softly
tart
cherries
vanilla
liquor
very
slightly
and
musky
wood
recognizable
aromas
but
very
well
arranged
taste
is
tart
and
perky
fruity
with
an
evenly
spread
funk
oaky
and
almost
a
super
tangy
orange
kind
of
tart
plus
cherries
of
course
more
people
should
have
this
beer
hazy
reddish
color
with
a
small
fizzling
head
sour
fruity
aroma
with
cherries
oak
and
malt
not
very
acidic
flavor
opens
with
tart
cherry
berries
light
vanilla
low
funk
malty
background
providing
a
pleasant
sweetness
some
light
tannins
are
mixed
in
and
some
tasty
grain
lingers
long
after
the
fruit
fades
puckering
medium
body
with
a
long
dry
finish
delicious
authentic
and
very
well
done
overall
pretty
good
beer
i
like
the
balance
of
the
oak
and
barnyard
funk
glad
i
tried
it
and
another
hit
for
me
from
arbor
brewing
company
man
if
only
all
of
this
beer
were
as
good
as
the
fragrance
advertises
i
mean
its
still
a
good
beer
but
the
nose
on
this
thing
just
screams
flemish
the
flavor
is
amazing
vinegar
sour
tones
are
definitely
there
i
get
minute
vanilla
hints
once
in
a
blue
moon
the
woody
tones
are
interesting
as
well
and
consistent
you
know
the
type
i
mean
if
youve
had
some
experience
with
the
style
this
seems
a
purists
interpretation
of
the
style
carries
all
of
the
characteristics
of
the
style
that
you
would
expect
to
find
but
usually
wouldnt
even
in
belgian
productions
a
difficult
style
to
pull
off
and
this
one
seems
to
be
doing
it
right
the
folks
at
arbor
brewing
should
be
proud
of
this
one
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
out
o
overall
excellent
beer
think
its
better
fresh
2011
is
better
than
2010
imo
but
2010
is
more
sour
still
it
left
a
tangy
light
prickly
sensation
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
and
was
decent
enough
to
buy
multiples
of
medium
to
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
however
this
might
have
potential
to
recarbonate
in
the
bottle
given
the
small
yeast
dose
in
the
bottle
base
hv
o
im
a
wine
drinker
also
so
i
enjoy
the
merlot
flavors
in
this
would
drink
another
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
while
having
funk
and
sourness
it
wasnt
over
the
top
and
drinking
one
bottle
would
be
easy
to
do
the
abv
on
this
beer
was
there
in
the
taste
but
nothing
over
the
top
like
some
of
these
beers
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
no
carbonation
maybe
a
bad
cork
but
the
beer
is
pretty
neat
and
very
drinkable
has
some
flanders
red
elements
and
a
bit
of
american
wild
pretty
cool
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
pretty
good
loved
the
smell
falls
a
bit
flat
in
the
taste
losing
a
bit
of
its
depth
i
think
even
a
little
carbonation
would
do
wonders
for
it
looks
like
the
carbonation
is
mixed
in
other
reviews
so
ill
see
if
i
can
find
another
and
reevaluate
it
is
quite
interesting
how
wine
like
this
beer
is
definitely
red
wine
too
the
nose
has
a
touch
more
malt
focus
than
the
flavor
but
even
it
is
really
evocative
of
a
fruity
oak
aged
red
wine
my
second
pour
sees
me
noticing
a
melding
of
buttery
oak
and
slightly
overly
ripe
funky
cheese
character
in
the
aroma
i
really
like
the
lactic
acidity
that
is
here
it
is
not
as
aggressive
as
would
be
found
in
a
traditional
lambic
but
it
plays
a
really
nice
offsetting
role
in
this
beer
this
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
to
it
as
the
red
wine
character
the
oakbarrel
notes
the
tart
funky
fermentation
character
and
the
supporting
malt
character
all
work
together
quite
well
i
feel
like
i
should
be
more
critical
of
this
beer
for
some
reason
but
it
is
so
well
integrated
so
complex
and
it
drinks
so
well
that
i
cant
help
but
really
really
enjoy
the
experience
this
is
one
that
should
age
very
well
i
really
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
slumbering
in
the
cellar
d
while
im
no
flemish
red
fan
this
one
has
a
nice
nose
the
tart
sourness
continues
into
the
taste
but
it
isnt
as
vinegary
there
a
pleasant
surprise
drinkabilityi
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
more
complex
sour
flavors
d
my
main
complaint
with
this
beer
was
that
the
flavor
was
not
quite
as
good
as
the
aroma
but
such
is
life
pretty
enjoyable
either
way
d
this
is
a
decent
flanders
red
overallbut
cedrtainly
not
the
best
in
the
world
its
not
very
sour
but
is
slightly
acidic
and
dry
the
only
turnoff
about
this
brew
really
is
the
slightly
metallic
presence
in
the
flavor
above
averagedecent
brew
overall
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
oak
with
some
tartness
and
some
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
tart
cherries
leather
oak
vanilla
chocolate
caramel
malt
and
red
wine
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
dpretty
tasty
and
improves
as
it
warms
notes
of
metallic
phenol
in
the
back
when
it
was
first
served
but
faded
balanced
not
bad
pretty
sure
this
is
what
i
am
drinking
labeled
as
rays
sour
at
the
brewery
light
reddish
hue
tart
bread
aroma
like
sour
dough
big
sour
yeast
taste
kind
of
tart
like
a
granny
smith
apple
i
like
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
brew
more
sour
than
most
i
have
had
of
this
style
on
tap
at
the
bruery
poured
into
taster
appearance
is
hazy
brownred
with
a
tall
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
some
lacing
aroma
is
a
little
funky
but
mostly
sour
led
by
tart
cherries
red
wine
vinegar
wood
and
leather
taste
is
strongly
sour
with
acidic
and
vinegar
notes
some
woody
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
offer
some
balance
medium
bodied
slightly
slick
lively
prickly
carbonation
long
puckering
finish
o
this
is
a
very
assertive
sour
beer
in
the
original
belgian
versions
i
prefer
examples
that
have
more
malt
complexity
and
less
overthetop
sourness
but
this
is
a
wellmade
clean
tasting
beer
that
has
its
own
good
qualities
this
beer
was
pretty
good
beautiful
red
pour
one
of
my
favorite
sours
to
date
as
the
smell
and
taste
seem
ideally
tuned
to
my
palate
mouthfeel
was
slightly
astringent
but
was
the
only
fault
i
could
find
with
this
beautifully
crafted
beer
this
a
nice
well
balanced
sour
complex
blend
of
sour
fruit
with
good
barrel
notes
sourness
is
prominent
but
not
extreme
sampled
by
accident
fantastic
for
the
style
not
for
me
though
honestly
overall
fantastic
and
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
strong
flanders
red
from
the
bruery
lots
of
bracing
bitterness
with
just
enough
sweetness
for
balance
2013
tasting
as
tart
as
i
remember
pucker
is
really
asserting
itself
over
the
fresh
version
its
a
good
beer
its
a
great
beer
really
but
i
cant
help
but
say
that
if
youve
had
one
bruery
sour
youve
had
most
of
them
excuse
my
ignoranttosours
palate
but
honestly
there
are
just
a
lot
of
the
similar
flavors
i
do
love
their
yeast
or
whatever
the
hell
they
use
though
this
is
of
course
puckering
with
a
nice
bit
of
oak
barrel
character
and
some
dark
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
but
i
just
would
have
liked
it
a
lot
more
had
it
been
my
first
bruery
beer
at
this
point
theyre
starting
to
taste
too
similar
and
just
not
worth
their
20
a
750ml
price
tag
regardless
if
you
like
sours
youll
like
this
one
bruery
still
has
some
of
the
best
out
there
good
wine
notes
boy
too
tart
i
am
new
to
sour
beers
i
have
had
better
good
level
of
funk
with
mild
to
moderate
tartness
i
would
say
this
beer
has
a
mild
sour
feel
to
it
very
drinkable
overall
very
solid
sour
the
first
time
i
tried
oude
tart
my
mind
was
blown
ive
since
discovered
a
new
world
of
sour
beer
but
this
one
still
stands
out
its
sour
but
balanced
and
hits
that
sour
note
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
just
right
black
berries
and
oak
flavors
throughout
2009
poured
111414
pours
an
almost
burgundy
color
with
a
very
thin
cream
colored
head
smells
very
sour
with
hints
of
tart
cherries
figs
and
red
wine
a
slight
hint
of
wood
the
flavor
is
sensationally
balanced
very
sour
but
also
very
sweet
the
fruit
character
comes
shining
through
i
know
this
will
make
my
tummy
hurt
a
definite
winner
from
the
bruery
amazing
flanders
really
sour
right
from
the
get
go
lot
of
cherry
and
vinegar
as
you
would
expect
but
the
oak
aging
tweaks
it
down
leaving
you
ready
for
more
pours
a
ruby
red
hue
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
the
smell
is
leather
oak
funk
and
cherries
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
coats
the
mouth
with
morello
cherries
funk
oak
and
finished
quite
dry
and
tart
and
overall
what
a
top
drop
and
take
on
this
style
would
buy
again
glad
i
drank
fresh
cheers
4
015
shamelessly
sour
extremely
tasty
i
expected
to
like
this
beer
and
was
not
disappointed
of
course
its
expense
makes
it
a
questionable
buy
but
its
availability
might
dictate
a
purchase
when
available
but
would
probably
want
to
hold
for
a
good
reason
to
drink
o
this
is
a
really
well
put
together
beer
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
for
the
style
to
be
honest
its
a
toss
up
between
this
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
la
folie
really
enjoyable
sipping
sour
that
isnt
too
sour
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
great
sour
here
overall
what
was
i
waiting
for
this
beer
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
originals
from
flanders
and
without
a
doubt
the
best
us
version
of
the
style
ive
encountered
intensely
sour
this
isnt
a
training
wheels
sour
o
very
good
flanders
red
ale
maybe
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
sorry
new
glarus
sour
notes
are
well
balanced
with
sweet
malt
fruit
and
oak
i
will
search
out
another
oude
tart
for
the
cellar
prost
overall
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
most
sours
i
love
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
but
that
beer
has
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
to
it
as
well
and
more
of
a
balsamic
taste
this
oude
tart
tastes
extremely
sour
and
im
sure
it
would
be
great
if
thats
all
youre
into
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
not
something
id
like
to
drink
again
wade
aroma
is
leathery
cherry
and
acetic
acid
taste
is
oaky
fruity
and
tart
body
is
medium
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
really
a
very
good
flanders
red
i
hadnt
had
this
style
for
a
while
but
should
get
it
more
often
maybe
not
this
in
amsterdam
very
obscure
variety
but
rather
a
more
easily
available
rodenbach
or
duchesse
de
bourgogne
little
too
tart
overall
just
a
really
welldone
flanders
red
personally
i
prefer
my
sour
beers
to
pack
a
pretty
good
wallop
and
this
one
certainly
delivers
over
a
full
bottle
you
get
more
than
enough
puckering
to
really
get
that
electric
sour
fix
id
love
to
try
the
version
with
cherries
some
day
since
the
base
beer
seemed
to
impart
notes
of
cherry
to
begin
with
although
i
definitely
preferred
the
aroma
of
this
beer
to
the
flavor
profile
it
is
an
allaround
impressive
offering
and
definitely
the
best
domestically
produced
example
of
the
style
the
bruery
is
best
when
they
stick
to
basic
but
unique
styles
imo
this
is
a
perfect
example
this
and
the
regular
saisons
have
always
been
my
personal
favorites
from
their
lineup
really
well
made
that
does
not
try
to
be
over
the
top
just
because
they
can
be
highly
recommended
opaque
brownred
pours
with
a
decent
relatively
long
lived
head
sour
cherry
and
oak
aroma
one
of
the
more
sour
sours
toasted
oak
and
sour
fruit
dry
and
full
bodied
preceded
this
with
la
folie
which
i
found
to
be
less
complex
less
sour
and
less
full
bodied
overall
this
is
very
good
for
an
american
representation
malty
but
a
nice
sourness
to
balance
it
overall
ill
seek
this
one
out
again
expensive
beer
but
well
worth
the
money
benchmark
sour
second
tasting
notes
i
had
a
lot
of
cranberry
as
it
warmed
an
outstanding
flemish
red
especially
from
an
american
brewery
very
sour
with
a
light
sweetness
for
balance
worth
seeking
out
o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
fruity
and
wine
like
tart
but
controlled
o
outstanding
flemish
sour
not
too
sweet
oak
did
seem
to
dominate
my
palate
as
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
but
you
can
definitely
pick
out
the
complexity
of
each
layer
of
flavors
if
there
werent
so
many
more
beers
out
there
to
try
and
i
had
a
lot
more
money
i
would
buy
2
or
3
more
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
sour
from
the
bruery
tip
of
the
tongue
tartness
with
the
swollow
being
more
mellow
and
open
oak
and
a
small
sourness
lasting
into
the
finish
some
of
the
class
flanders
red
flavors
of
red
currents
with
a
sweettart
balance
and
low
carmel
in
a
supporting
malt
body
i
like
that
this
one
is
fairly
strongly
tilted
towards
the
tart
and
lightly
sweet
making
it
an
immensely
food
friendly
perhaps
one
of
the
best
of
only
a
few
american
flanders
red
ales
i
have
had
authentic
tartness
with
that
slight
vinegar
and
diacetyl
that
i
find
in
beers
like
rodenbach
and
duchesse
o
incredible
unabashed
sour
character
with
clear
natural
cherry
notes
that
last
on
the
palate
the
barrel
aging
surely
contributing
to
the
sourness
and
the
smoothness
quality
throughout
i
wouldnt
think
twice
about
spending
my
money
on
this
beer
again
i
its
delicious
a
lot
of
funk
and
complexity
overall
a
nicely
done
sour
but
i
dont
think
this
is
very
similar
to
alot
of
other
flanders
reds
out
there
its
much
more
sour
overall
terrific
supremely
drinkable
refreshing
and
tons
of
tartness
along
with
la
folie
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
sours
o
impressive
on
all
fronts
a
truly
special
beer
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
great
representative
for
the
style
it
just
doesnt
get
much
better
1
year
aged
bottle
pours
an
opaque
slightly
reddish
chocolate
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
though
effervescent
light
tan
head
sour
apple
dominates
the
strong
aroma
flavor
is
very
tart
you
may
exercise
facial
muscles
you
never
knew
you
had
underlying
hints
of
caramel
and
oak
support
the
bold
tartness
texture
is
smooth
and
firm
if
not
too
fizzy
pucker
up
sweetie
to
me
this
is
just
too
damn
sour
its
hard
to
focus
on
any
other
component
of
this
beer
definitely
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
a
lot
berry
red
fruit
but
really
just
acidic
and
incredibly
sour
a
little
more
palatable
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
but
still
a
bit
extreme
not
my
thing
at
all
reddish
amber
hued
with
a
minuscule
head
of
white
foam
partially
covering
the
top
of
the
beer
sour
aroma
of
tart
cherries
is
very
pungent
the
mouth
is
highly
carbonated
and
the
intense
bitterness
pricks
the
tongue
and
yet
theres
a
nice
dry
finish
theres
definitely
tart
cherries
and
a
horse
blanket
element
in
the
taste
a
fermented
concoction
of
berries
this
was
hyped
both
as
too
sour
and
tart
and
also
as
a
world
class
beer
my
vote
is
for
the
later
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
at
the
17
price
range
it
is
a
little
hard
to
justify
purchasing
this
beer
regularly
but
i
will
every
now
and
again
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
still
feel
like
there
are
better
examples
out
there
to
be
had
superb
ale
that
i
can
finally
knock
off
the
bucket
list
oreally
nice
representation
of
the
style
nice
flavor
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
a
genuinely
balanced
but
still
big
and
saucy
sour
red
ale
the
wellrounded
fruity
tartness
let
out
to
play
but
not
at
the
cost
of
an
overwrought
palate
pillaging
the
wood
treatment
is
complex
understated
and
just
about
right
quite
an
apt
representation
for
the
style
but
all
other
things
are
not
equal
with
this
offering
the
serving
size
and
sticker
price
cannot
compete
with
those
venerable
inclass
imports
im
afraid
mf
a
long
dry
finish
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
is
felt
4
75
o
for
a
sour
this
is
world
class
everything
youd
expect
from
this
style
is
there
and
more
the
feel
gets
all
the
complexity
and
saying
it
again
depth
of
this
style
acidic
and
dry
the
medium
body
is
yet
creamy
its
moderate
carbonation
carries
through
to
add
a
bite
on
the
tongue
even
while
it
flows
so
smoothly
and
it
carries
a
certain
brightness
as
well
tough
sell
with
cheap
bottles
of
rodenbach
on
the
same
shelf
but
solid
beer
from
start
to
finish
and
i
can
easily
recommend
it
this
beer
is
the
first
sour
that
ive
tried
the
only
description
that
i
can
utter
is
wow
the
depth
of
flavors
and
the
complexity
on
the
palate
is
extraordinary
having
had
no
experience
with
sours
much
less
flanders
reds
made
this
one
amazing
beer
to
taste
a
must
have
a
very
good
representation
of
the
flanders
red
ale
style
as
complex
as
this
style
can
be
i
think
it
is
hard
to
find
one
that
can
be
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
look
no
further
because
this
is
it
overall
good
flanders
red
enjoyed
this
better
than
most
others
ive
had
duchesse
is
tastier
with
this
being
less
complex
but
just
as
enjoyable
price
point
is
always
an
issue
but
i
wont
beat
the
dead
horse
glad
to
finally
try
this
slightly
aged

my

a
bit
more

balance
would
help
too
od
a
well
made
flemmish
red
a
step
below
rodenbach
vintages
but
definitely
showing
similar
qualities
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
worthy
of
the
hype
and
price
tag
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
from
the
united
states
i
have
no
idea
how
ive
not
had
it
do
date
well
yes
i
do
its
over
20
bucks
a
bottle
and
therefore
prohibitively
expensive
but
its
the
holidays
so
what
the
heck
the
color
is
a
murky
dark
red
darker
than
raspberry
jam
lighter
than
traditional
brick
red
with
one
nice
inch
of
white
bubbly
head
on
it
it
smells
of
fresh
and
dried
red
fruit
from
cranberries
with
their
tartness
to
cherries
with
their
sweetness
even
prunes
or
raisins
with
their
wrinkly
gumminess
its
lovely
all
the
way
through
with
a
ton
of
acid
making
my
mouth
water
for
a
taste
the
flavor
is
great
too
all
the
fruit
into
one
really
sour
brew
its
got
that
classic
flanders
front
of
tongue
acidity
almost
too
much
and
this
is
a
bottle
to
share
for
that
reason
it
puckers
me
right
up
demanding
perseverance
from
my
taste
buds
long
dry
finish
didnt
think
that
was
possible
until
this
beer
the
fruit
is
nice
the
red
malt
is
bigger
and
the
ph
has
to
be
real
low
well
carbonated
body
makes
it
fizzle
and
snap
in
my
mouth
and
the
acidity
prevents
major
drinkability
i
am
intrigued
enough
by
this
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
its
quite
enjoyable
but
at
this
price
their
are
other
serviceable
options
to
get
my
flanders
fix
top
quality
as
always
from
the
bruery
this
is
a
more
than
a
decent
sour
red
but
it
lacks
the
sweet
bready
malt
backbone
that
really
differentiates
the
flemish
red
style
from
the
rest
of
the
sour
styles
judging
on
taste
alone
this
is
a
very
solid
and
aggressive
albeit
not
the
most
complex
sour
that
ive
had
id
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
only
the
most
devout
sour
fans
despite
what
the
name
says
this
is
definitely
more
than
just
merely
tart
overall
can
easily
understand
why
this
is
such
a
highly
revered
beer
really
shines
in
the
cherry
and
sour
departments
paired
with
some
vanilla
bean
ice
cream
is
delicious
overall
really
good
beer
and
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
at
try
but
if
youre
worried
about
your
wallet
grab
one
of
the
aforementioned
flemish
reds
you
wont
miss
much
other
than
a
tick
m
lighter
bodied
decent
carb
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
total
4050
o
intense
sourness
overpowers
most
of
the
semblance
of
your
typical
flanders
maybe
wouldve
liked
it
more
balanced
overall
but
still
quite
good
overall
pretty
good
but
not
too
memorable
poured

the
tasting
room
brownish

mostly
clear
with
a
small
white

that
recedes
quickly
big
time
sour
vinegar
aroma
stronger
than
any
other
sour
i
have
had
maybe
some
light
sweet
apples
and
cherries
as
well
flavor
follows
with
a
massive
hit
of
sour
some
light
funky
vinegar
and
a
bit
of
sour
fruits
there
is
a
big
dry
oak
influence
here
that
differentiates
this
from
others
i
have
had
in
the
style
light
sweet
malts
remain
on
the
palate
this
was
heavier
than
the
berazzled
and
definitely
hit
the
taste
buds
hard
enjoyable
odanother
expensive
bruery
beer
i
initially
regret
buying
and
am
subsequently
satisfied
after
imbibing
overall
still
learning
my
way
around
the
sours
this
delivers
for
sure
once
again
another
bruery
offering
that
i
just
dont
understand
20
bucks
for
a
bottle
that
doesnt
provide
complexity
as
it
warms
staying
the
same
few
flavors
the
entire
way
i
think
its
more
of
a
10
dollar
bottle
not
a
20
a
decent
beer
for
a
sour
fix
but
not
when
its
costing
you
20
bucks
grab
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
for
half
the
price
instead
this
is
really
an
exceptional
sour
i
really
love
how
complex
and
sour
it
is
overall
wow
this
one
was
a
lot
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
definitely
the
most
sour
of
its
style
for
me
nice
cherry
and
sour
flavors
in
there
but
just
a
tad
sour
for
me
would
prefer
it
if
it
were
a
bit
more
balanced
still
a
quality
brew
of
the
style
and
quite
tasty
i
am
wondering
if
this
might
be
a
bit
older
than
my
2012
estimate
from
the
carbonation
and
flavor
profile
i
hate
reviewing
these
beers
as
its
hard
to
explain
why
one
is
better
than
another
this
is
an
great
example
of
the
style
that
falls
into
the
intense
and
strong
side
it
isnt
going
to
top
the
kind
and
its
priced
at
nearly
twice
the
price
but
im
digging
it
big
time
overall
a
very
nice
flanders
ale
very
very
similar
i
dont
think
i
could
tell
the
difference
to
be
honest
to
some
of
the
better
known
american
wild
ales
like
russian
rivers
supplication
and
consecration
overall
it
was
tough
to
decide
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
as
it
was
a
tossup
between
its
nose
its
flavoring
and
its
soft
fluffy
feel
from
the
first
whiff
you
get
an
idea
of
just
how
high
quality
and
well
thought
out
this
beer
is
the
aroma
is
subtle
and
nuanced
but
yet
still
knocks
you
to
the
ground
with
its
bright
sourness
of
fruit
wood
dangerously
deep
grain
and
yeasty
funk
the
flavoring
follows
as
best
as
anything
could
with
the
same
interplay
of
wild
depth
generous
fruit
and
tartness
and
inlaid
woody
warmth
the
flavors
are
sweet
but
effectively
tart
with
the
final
blend
striking
an
amazingly
easy
sipping
balance
that
defies
warmth
and
environment
this
is
helped
along
by
the
mouthfeel
that
affords
high
carbonation
and
nice
prickle
appropriate
to
the
level
of
pucker
but
also
gives
big
frothy
creaminess
on
the
swirl
around
the
mouth
helping
to
add
buoyancy
and
body
to
the
diving
deepness
of
the
flavor
profile
this
is
an
incredible
beer
for
the
style
and
for
the
brewerys
sourtart
lineup
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
either
then
this
is
a
musthave
glad
to
be
finally
trying
this
stuff
especially
considering
my
man
ryan
has
been
lauding
it
forever
it
pours
a
clear
garnet
roby
tones
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
cherry
red
wine
vinegar
mild
oak
light
graham
cracker
and
a
bit
of
sour
blue
raspberry
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
tartness
in
full
form
for
most
of
the
show
though
a
vein
of
very
mild
molasses
seems
to
enter
stage
left
near
the
finish
and
stays
through
the
encore
mellowing
things
slightly
and
dancing
provocatively
with
the
graham
cracker
and
oak
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
sour
not
quite
what
i
would
think
of
when
flanders
red
is
spoken
but
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
american
take
on
the
classic
style
good
times
verdict
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
american
made
flanders
red
very
nice
mix
of
flavors
with
very
nice
balance
while
not
quite
on
the
level
of
rodenbach
i
always
relish
the
chance
to
have
this
a
very
enjoyable
brew
not
the
sourest
beer
ive
had
tart
of
darkness
destroyed
my
palate
more
than
this
one
did
but
probably
one
of
the
3
or
4
sourest
the
flavor
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
i
have
experienced
in
other
sours
and
it
could
really
use
just
a
bit
more
sweetness
for
balance
nevertheless
i
know
those
bas
for
whom
sours
can
never
get
sour
enough
probably
love
this
beer
ill
have
to
drink
this
bomber
over
two
days
otherwise
it
will
destroy
the
lining
of
my
stomach
o
the
metallic
finish
is
off
putting
and
so
is
the
overly
strong
acetic
character
id
say
this
brew
is
best
fresh
as
not
much
good
comes
from
holding
onto
it
but
even
in
spite
of
that
its
still
a
great
representation
of
the
style
this
is
a
damn
good
oude
bruin
lots
of
flavors
and
its
very
sour
a
little
thin
but
it
works
well
this
has
the
distinction
of
being
the
first
sour
beer
that
ive
thouroughly
enjoyed
very
complex
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
cherry
variation
appearance
is
dark
red
brown
with
a
short
head
its
nose
hits
right
away
with
vinegar
dried
fruits
and
funk
for
the
taste
there
are
cherries
certainly
a
tartness
as
the
name
implies
a
little
flavor
of
red
wine
too
mouthfeel
is
medium
rich
it
makes
you
pucker
and
some
of
the
sourness
lingers
but
it
is
a
in
pleasant
manner
had
this
a
few
times
but
wanted
to
finally
take
some
notes
it
is
nice
that
it
is
now
easy
to
get
in
the
new
york
area
pleasantly
sour
with
hints
of
leather
dark
fruit
and
toasty
oak
from
extended
aging
in
oak
barrels
do
a
fine
approximation
of
the
sour
ales
of
flanders
belgium
this
beer
takes
a
more
careful
approach
than
some
in
the
way
it
is
short
on
overt
sweetness
the
malt
yeast
and
bacteria
all
cooperate
nicely
leading
to
a
final
product
that
seeks
not
to
challenge
but
to
showcase
some
traditional
qualities
none
shine
brighter
in
the
final
tally
than
the
wood
influence
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
fairly
approachable
for
the
flanders
red
ale
style
and
a
great
example
of
it
though
if
you
have
no
interest
in
sour
beers
this
is
one
to
avoid
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
had
just
the
right
amount
of
tartnesssourness
and
acidity
o
this
beer
is
pleasantly
sour
and
tart
but
in
no
way
over
the
top
overpowering
so
its
rather
drinkable
compared
to
other
beer
in
the
style
d
the
aroma
is
excellent
and
the
flavor
profile
isnt
far
behind
single
finger
off
white
head
on
a
clear
red
brown
and
amber
body
with
excellent
lacing
aroma
of
cola
oak
brown
sugar
candied
orange
dark
fruit
including
fig
raisins
and
cherry
flavor
is
less
complex
but
still
very
good
with
mostly
sour
cherries
some
brown
sugar
and
oak
notes
throughout
fairly
thick
and
oily
body
and
light
carbonation
simple
but
good
seemed
a
little
watery
but
its
hard
to
critize
this
one
too
much
bottle
shop
manager
near
me
upon
hearing
that
i
was
going
to
share
this
beer
told
me
dont
drink
it
with
your
wife
youll
thank
me
later
well
he
was
dead
right
it
pours
even
deeper
than
ruby
with
a
mahogany
tint
to
it
not
as
much
of
a
tart
smell
as
ive
gotten
in
others
but
the
oaken
notes
come
right
out
of
the
bottle
and
hit
you
from
a
few
feet
away
you
also
get
the
barrel
in
the
taste
and
its
not
so
sour
that
it
curls
your
eye
shut
it
has
a
perfect
balance
of
everything
and
even
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
that
i
have
never
tasted
in
a
sour
it
has
a
clean
finish
and
doesnt
linger
past
its
welcome
mouthfeeloverall
mouthfeel
is
light
without
a
ton
of
carbonation
decent
overall
not
a
bad
sour
a
little
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
and
kind
of
one
dimensional
worth
a
try
though
overall
excellent
beer
and
on
of
the
best
american
versions
of
the
style
its
heavier
on
the
lactic
sourness
and
lighter
on
the
sweetness
and
stone
fruit
flavors
than
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
complaint
this
is
a
great
beer
thats
worth
seeking
out
d
great
sourness
and
tartness
very
well
balanced
and
complex
this
is
my
first
the
bruery
offering
at
a
wild
ale
i
am
use
to
rr
or
crooked
stave
sours
so
i
am
that
dick
teacher
who
gives
cs
for
a
b
work
this
beer
is
a
little
dry
for
me
perhaps
the
first
year
of
vintage
is
working
against
this
one
it
will
be
interesting
to
compare
against
the
newer
vintages
i
have
in
the
cellar
overall
i
am
happy
but
not
thrilled
for
this
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
next
few
wilds
that
the
bruery
has
for
my
palate
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
overall
is
not
bad
and
the
enjoyable
aspects
are
very
enjoyable
by
flanders
standards
it
hits
the
mark
but
isnt
a
standout
worth
trying
and
despite
my
gripes
and
displeasure
at
some
of
its
character
i
am
glad
i
have
another
bottle
or
2
to
enjoy
with
some
more
age
ouded
tart
really
does
all
it
says
in
its
name
it
is
tart
with
the
taste
of
dried
acidic
and
succulent
fruits
but
also
gives
aged
savory
notes
that
shows
the
beers
patience
and
maturity
i
love
the
beer
for
all
it
is
although
its
depth
is
just
off
of
rodenbach
examples
a
tasty
and
substantial
sour
the
sourness
level
is
right
on
for
someone
who
prefers
a
more
aggressively
sour
beer
this
is
a
full
flavored
very
tasty
beer
lots
of
tartness
with
a
nice
oakyvanilla
barrel
notes
o
great
sour
glad
to
have
picked
this
one
up
overall
a
wonderfully
dry
oaky
sour
beer
it
was
sour
and
tart
but
they
did
a
nice
job
controlling
that
the
sour
and
tartness
never
really
got
full
strength
same
story
with
the
oak
this
beer
is
on
the
pricey
side
is
it
worth
it
only
if
you
like
sours
and
you
want
something
different
to
drink
served
a
deep
auburn
colored
body
with
only
a
slim
bubbly
covering
on
top
tart
acidic
fruity
aroma
cherry
vinegar
brown
sugar
dry
floral
notes
and
a
warm
spiciness
juicy
tart
flavor
sour
apple
berry
light
wood
some
wine
and
not
too
much
sweetness
from
the
malt
dry
and
lightly
effervescent
making
for
a
super
refreshing
beverage
very
very
satisfying
and
delicious
o
excellent
awesome
brew
i
cant
believe
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
highly
recommended
and
cant
wait
for
next
years
release
exactly
the
beer
i
wanted
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
really
stood
out
the
appearance
was
lacking
and
the
smell
was
somewhere
in
the
middle
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
bruery
beers
if
you
like
mouth
puckering
sour
like
i
do
then
youll
really
enjoy
this
o
a
nice
beer
tasty
and
since
i
have
two
more
bottles
ill
drink
again
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
not
even
close
to
cuvee
de
jacobins
rouge
as
far
as
flavor
on
par
with
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
at
double
the
cost
its
a
tough
sell
overall
this
beer
could
be
better
in
some
areas
but
overall
i
am
enjoying
it
a
whole
helluva
lot
id
love
to
have
it
again
hazy
reddishbrown
pour
into
a
goblet
capped
off
with
a
good
inch
of
foamy
eggshell
head
that
retained
and
laced
well
cherry
and
apple
in
the
nose
notes
of
caramel
and
vanilla
lesser
hints
of
leather
and
citric
and
acetic
acid
decent
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
in
the
taste
cherry
apple
lemon
plum
a
good
malty
base
keeping
everything
in
check
some
leathery
tannins
and
some
woody
dryness
a
little
bit
of
souring
vinegar
but
nothing
too
puckering
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
overall
pretty
nice
and
from
the
bruery
one
of
the
few
that
hasnt
let
me
down
as
it
warms
its
simplicity
emerges
d
its
alright
as
far
as
sours
go
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
nor
pay
the
high
price
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
entirely
too
simple
if
this
had
been
a
5
bottle
i
wouldnt
have
minded
so
much
but
this
is
a
20
bottle
of
beer
do
not
waste
your
money
it
is
definitely
not
worth
it
very
nice
example
of
the
style
beautifully
tart
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
give
it
balance
and
a
lush
fruitiness
framed
beautifully
by
the
sourness
a
very
pretty
pour
dark
brown
with
a
slight
plum
cast
and
just
a
little
head
though
the
carbonation
is
fine
tart
nose
of
delicate
cherry
red
currant
damp
earth
and
leather
the
taste
is
quite
tart
with
a
bit
of
slightly
spicy
sweetness
particularly
on
the
finish
more
notes
of
bright
fruit
with
tastes
of
blackberries
raspberries
cherries
and
currants
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
leather
rounds
it
out
very
smooth
and
quite
a
great
sipper
well
done
deep
opaque
mahogany
with
a
light
brown
head
acetic
nose
some
oak
barrel
a
whole
load
of
cherry
and
other
berries
and
a
gentle
sweetness
taste
is
lightly
acetic
tart
berries
and
cherries
again
some
oak
and
more
barrel
sweetness
medium
high
carbonation
lighter
feel
a
very
nice
flemish
red
epitomizes
simplicity
and
subtlety
quite
enjoyed
this
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
some
more
carbonation
would
make
it
better
one
of
the
better
sours
i
have
had
lately
overall
a
really
tasty
and
fullflavored
beer
but
definitely
not
a
complex
one
maybe
if
the
tartness
was
dialed
down
a
bit
more
interesting
characteristics
would
come
through
oa
great
sour
the
balance
was
spot
on
a
great
beer
that
was
worth
the
price
tag
o
overall
mouth
puckering
eye
squinting
sourness
hard
to
rate
a
flanders
ale
due
to
its
lack
of
range
ive
only
managed
to
have
a
few
thus
far
but
this
is
very
clean
and
polished
in
execution
i
may
not
be
the
biggest
fan
but
am
respectful
of
its
intentions
and
this
is
very
good
at
that
how
can
i
be
constructive
if
a
product
makes
me
this
sad
othis
may
beat
out
la
folie
as
my
favorite
new
world
oud
bruinflanders
red
the
flavors
were
intense
this
thing
was
sour
but
so
cleanly
meshed
with
one
another
this
is
not
a
funky
earthy
barnyard
lambic
but
a
nice
drinking
sour
brew
with
great
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
and
a
drinkable
feel
that
would
work
well
with
dinner
or
as
i
had
it
with
a
soft
cheese
and
crackers
on
tap
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
this
is
a
tasty
sour
but
at
20
id
rather
go
with
something
from
rodenbach
o
this
beer
smells
amazing
so
complex
the
flavor
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
though
i
remember
this
tasting
better
in
past
years
too
o
the
bruery
oude
tart
is
like
a
flanders
on
steroids
but
they
manage
to
ramp
the
beer
up
while
hitting
the
nail
right
on
the
head
completely
reminiscent
of
monks
cafe
rodenbock
etc
this
powerhouse
of
a
tart
beer
is
quite
an
experience
to
behold
this
is
a
very
tough
style
to
nail
even
moreso
than
fruit
lambics
imo
oude
tart
is
a
great
example
of
a
brewery
with
a
wellregarded
sour
program
struggling
with
the
oude
bruin
style
a
very
enjoyable
flanders
that
delivers
a
wealth
of
complexity
and
loads
of
tartness
this
guy
works
on
all
levels
enjoyable
overall
a
nice
flanders
but
this
is
a
bit
too
in
your
face
for
me
picked
up
the
last
three
bottles
at
a
store
in
downtown
fburg
poured
into
my
dfh
tulip
wonderful
dark
rubybrown
in
color
with
very
little
head
but
decent
lacing
remains
around
the
edge
nose
is
nice
and
fruity
with
some
dark
notes
and
funk
at
the
end
taste
is
wonderful
hints
of
cherry
sweetness
that
give
way
to
delicious
sourfunk
with
the
oak
gently
permeating
the
whole
process
very
well
done
glad
i
have
two
more
bottles
for
the
cellar
i
love
the
bruery
but
maybe
time
for
a
few
375ml
releases
750
is
a
lot
to
drink
and
purchase
for
one
man
but
all
in
all
excellent
beer
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
like
syrupy
black
cherries
with
thin
tan
head
that
fades
before
your
eyes
and
has
absolutely
no
retention
the
nose
is
tart
and
sweet
reminiscent
of
cherries
with
additional
notes
of
oak
and
a
slight
acetone
the
taste
is
reserved
with
subtle
hints
of
wood
cherries
and
an
almost
negligible
vinegar
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
then
tart
finishing
exceedingly
dry
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
my
duck
venison
and
veggie
medley
yeah
thats
how
i
roll
the
day
after
thanksgiving
definitely
worth
trying
but
considering
the
price
and
availability
none
its
probably
not
a
repeat
o
when
you
buy
a
bottle
of
beer
for
22
you
expect
it
to
be
out
of
this
world
especially
when
its
one
youve
heard
about
for
so
long
this
was
a
disappointment
but
still
good
just
not
worth
that
price
tag
bottle
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
tart
notes
with
some
light
cherries
and
some
wood
with
light
vinous
feels
taste
is
a
good
mix
between
some
tart
cherries
notes
with
clear
oak
notes
and
some
wood
with
limited
acidity
level
funky
notes
are
clearly
distinguishable
body
is
about
average
with
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
still
quite
a
way
behind
other
flanders
red
such
as
rodenbach
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
went
great
with
thanksgiving
if
i
can
save
up
another
extra
20
before
they
sell
out
ill
be
sure
to
add
one
to
my
cellar
o
a
stellar
american
take
on
a
flanders
red
aggressively
acidic
and
bracingly
sour
with
an
amazingly
smooth
body
pours
a
dark
brown
one
finger
white
head
into
a
tulip
glass
sweet
at
first
but
leaves
a
nice
slightly
sour
flavor
excellent
taste
leaves
you
wanting
more
not
overpowering
to
the
nose
nor
weak
to
taste
a
well
balanced
flemish
red
that
you
can
certainly
drink
own
your
own
having
just
broken
into
the
sour
beer
style
this
is
one
that
i
would
get
frequently
i
poured
from
a
25
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
dark
brown
pour
slight
white
head
lots
of
oak
and
cherries
on
the
nose
very
tart
notes
of
cherries
oak
vinegar
linering

the
beer
is
refreshingly
tart
acidic
medium
in
body
a
very
enjoyable
flanders
red
no
problem
finishing
the
entire
bottle
pours
deep
brown
with
a
ruby
tint
and
a
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
nothing
but
a
ring
nose
is
sour
grapes
tart
cherries
grape
juice
oak
slight
burnt
oak
notes
dark
fruits
plums
apple
skins
and
maybe
just
a
bit
of
leather
taste

very
tart
with
grape

flavors
up
front
that
mingle
with
cherries
plums
a
bit
of
oak
leather
green
apples
apple
skins
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
pear
the
body
is
very
light
the
carbonation
is
sharp
but
not
overpowering
its
perfect
for
this
style
this
is
an
awesome
sour
the
bruery
is
2
for
2
in
sours
for
me
the
other
being
tart
of
darkness
o
this
was
the
first
sour
beer
that
i
truly
enjoyed
maybe
it
was
the
unique
style
which
i
dont
think
have
had
before
either
way
very
enjoyable
overall
a
really
nice
take
on
a
darker
sourflemish
red
the
sour
cherry
character
mixes
well
with
the
toasted
malt
character
and
the
vanilla
from
the
barrels
really
balanced
and
tasty
throughout
not
sure
if
it
is
worth
the
price
tag
but
certainly
tasty
o
a
great
sour
worth
the
price
tag
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
oude
tart
pours
a
burnt
leathery
brown
with
very
scant
ruby
highlights
the
color
is
murky
and
the
beers
topped
with
just
a
finger
or
so
of
khaki
colored
foam
head
retention
is
alright
and
lacing
is
pretty
sparse
the
nose
has
lots
of
very
tart
cherries
along
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
the
flavor
profile
has
a
bit
of
leather
and
tobacco
to
it
some
kind
of
combination
of
oxidation
and
a
little
bit
of
brettanomyces
theres
also
the
requisite
vinous
acidity
and
cherry
notes
with
that
same
subtle
hint
of
wood
from
the
nose
providing
the
finish
theres
a
tannic
mouthpuckering
quality
to
the
beer
which
i
suppose
is
to
be
expected
the
body
is
suitaby
dry
but
th
carbonation
just
feels
a
little
lackluster
still
oude
tart
is
a
great
very
well
layered
flanders
red
ale
one
that
can
hang
with
the
heavy
hitters
from
belgium
o
my
second
sour
ever
very
pleased
with
this
offering
load
em
up
i
want
more
o
fantastic
scent
and
something
about
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
enigmatic
and
drew
me
into
the
beverage
the
appearance
is
dark
and
with
its
initial
pour
almost
reminds
one
of
coke
the
scent
is
solid
and
intriguing
while
the
taste
lacks
a
few
of
the
qualities
noted
in
the
smell
that
wouldve
made
this
a
more
interesting
flanders
smells
and
tastes
of
tart
cherries
oak
wood
apples
apple
cider
vinegar
light
blueberries
and
blackberries
and
just
a
slight
ghost
of
leather
that
i
hope
cellaring
will
amplify
the
funk
levels
are
at
a
solid
medium
and
balanced
well
against
the
tart
sourness
at
this
point
i
wouldnt
mind
it
much
if
the
funkiness
increased
with
cellaring
as
well
im
glad
ive
got
another
bottle
in
the
basement
to
try
later
o
a
solid
sour
overall
though
lacking
in
complexity
medium
body
well
carbonated
bubbly
and
dry
on
the
tongue
excellent
american
take
on
the
style
nice
balance
fruit
and
milder
sourness
o
fantastic
sour
beer
one
that
will
most
likely
stand
up
well
to
a
year
or
two
of
aging
its
tart
its
woody
its
fruity
its
delicious
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
bruery
beers
ive
tried
recommend
it
to
all
sour
fans
overall
real
solid
and
delicious
o
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
it
does
not
disappoint
i
enjoy
this
style
because
it
bridges
the
gap
between
wine
and
beer
i
only
wish
i
could
have
whipped
up
some
wild
board
on
parpedelle
pasta
to
really
enhance
both
the
beer
and
the
food
wine
is
made
for
food
and
wine
often
shows
better
when
paired
against
it
this
beer
is
just
begging
for
food
and
could
pair
with
more
dishes
than
almost
any
other
style
of
beer
or
wine
dark
oak
in
color
beneath
a
creamy
somewhat
carbonated

leaves

thin
and
ringed

range
from
sour
vinous
fruit
to
a
slight
peat
moss
quality
very
fresh
tasting
a
bright
and
clean
tartness
apple
orange
and
plum
the
slight
toasted
malt
sweetness
provides
a
nice
balance
to
the
sour
qualities
even
adding
a
tough
of
richness
at
times
medium
bodied
mellow
on
the
palate
for
the
style
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
really
great
offering
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
o
very
good
and
more
mild
than
initially
thought
pours
a
murky
dark
reddish
brown
with
about
a
12
finger
head
when
held
to
the
light
it
has
a
wonderful
ruby
color
smells
of
tart
dark
fruit
lip
smacking
tartness
with
a
touch
of
bubbly
zip
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
this
was
my
first
offering
from
the
bruery
if
the
other
beers
are
as
nice
as
this
one
im
excited
to
try
the
rest
othis
is
a
pretty
complex
beer
that
seems
to
gets
more
flavor
as
it
goes
down
its
like
a
delicious
dessert
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
and
less
acidity
than
other
red
flanders
ales
yet
still
has
that
taste
of
vinegar

away
quickly
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing

is
nice
but
seems
a
little
weak
to
me
the
brew
smells
like
tart
cherries
red
wine
grapes
vinegar
and
oak
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
tart

also
an

its
a
good

i

bit
pricey

fruit
a
mix
of
cherry
and
lots
of
raisins
it
almost
was
on
the
cusp
of
being
a
sour
quad
o
one
of
the
better
american
made
flanders
i
have
tried
at
a
slightly
lower
price
i
think
i
prefer
the
rodenbach
vintage
series
over
this
though
o
this
sour
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
breweries
who
are
wanting
to
learn
the
technique
of
making
this
type
of
beer
please
study
this
one
another
great
beer
from
the
bruery
o
an
interesting
beer
and
another
great
sour
from
the
bruery
the
oak
and
wine
flavors
from
the
barrels
are
really
nice
o
i
taste
a
lot
of
elements
in
this
beer
that
clamor
for
my
attention
the
bitterness
the
acidity
etc
and
the
result
is
a
bitter
mess
thats
really
difficult
to
enjoy
fans
of
the
brewing
style
might
taste
something
that
i
just
dont
understand
but
oude
tart
and
i
dont
have
a
common
ground
a
fantastic
flanders
red
i
enjoyed
every
second
of
drinking
this
and
had
a
frowny
face
when
i
ran
out
overall
55
the
bruery
has
a
straightup
wow
beer
in
oude
tart
that
this
beers
flavor
quality
and
complexity
aroma
and
mouthfeel
surpass
those
of
all
the
belgian
flanders
reds
is
a
testament
to
just
how
excellent
a
creation
oude
tart
really
is
extraordinary
overall
definitely
one
of
the
top
flemishstyle
red
ales
that
ive
had
so
far
oude
tart
is
a
very
exceptional
representation
of
its
style
and
my
favorite
characteristics
of
this
beer
is
the
toasted
oak
the
tart
dark
fruits
and
the
vanilla
from
the
oak
barrels
another
outstanding
brew
that
ive
had
from
the
bruery
figures
i
just
complained
about
a
beer
being
too
overthetop
sour
cascade
sang
noir
and
now
im
drinking
a
beer
that
i
think
lacks
sourness
this
is
tasty
but
there
are
better
more
readily
accessible
flanders
reds
out
there
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
try
this
at
beer
fests
at
least
twice
each
time
it
was
more
tart
than
this
particular
bottle
heavy
on
the
oak
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
too
much
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
red
with
a
creamy
white
ring
of
head
on
the
edges
its
too
dark
to
really
see
through
it
and
is
hazy
to
boot
but
there
do
seem
to
be
bubbles
traveling
up
the
sides
to
suggest
carbonation
the
lacing
stays
on
as
a
clinging
ring
of
sticky
dry
bubbles
the
beer
smells
like
leathery
dark
cherry
with
a
slight
alcoholic
bite
in
the
back
of
the
nose
its
as
if
a
dried
cherry
strip
were
created
and
then
liquefied
malt
backbone
is
faint
but
seems
to
be
sweet
and
caramely
the
tart
cherry
smell
is
the
entirety
of
the
bitters
in
this
beer
there
is
also
a
faint
note
of
creamy
chocolate
in
the
noses
base
which
may
also
be
the
malt
the
beer
tastes
puckeringly
tart
and
cherry
fruity
with
a
faint
chocolaty
feel
in
the
middle
and
a
slight
aftertaste
the
tart
cherry
is
the
main
taste
in
this
beer
though
and
it
shines
through
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
in
the
taste
blending
in
with
the
tartness
to
completely
mask
itself
there
is
also
a
great
funk
that
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
suggests
some
fantastic
spiciness
vanilla
notes
are
also
present
in
the
middle
and
aftertaste
that
provide
a
sweet
and
creamy
taste
mouthfeel
is
puckering
and
tart
with
the
sour
obviously
the
carbonation
however
is
completely
velvety
and
smooth
with
a
slight
chewiness
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
already
love
the
complexity
of
the
beers
flavor
this
is
admittedly
my
first
flemish
red
and
i
am
very
happy
with
what
it
has
proven
to
be
this
beer
is
obviously
worth
a
taste
for
anyone
thats
a
beer
lover
especially
sour
beer
lovers
and
is
also
worth
a
try
for
anyone
that
loves
sour
tastes
especially
warheads
try
this
beer
love
love
love
it
need
one
for
the
cellar
now
o
very
good
but
there
are
better
american
flandersstyle
sours
out
there
overall
an
amazing
sour
beer
i
want
to
bathe
in
it
o
awesome
one
of
my
favorite
sours
i
can
only
imagine
how
awesome
this
is
when
it
is
actually
uses
cherries
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
a
great
beer
lived
up
to
expectations
and
i
like
it
more
than
some
more
traditional
belgian
examples
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
occasion
but
now
that
oude
tart
is
on
the
east
coast
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
light
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
sharp
carbonation
that
lightens
the
effect
of
the
sourness
o
a
great
beer
the
sour
character
is
potent
and
delicious
overall
a
fantastic
sour
thats
best
when
at
a
warmer
temp
than
fridge
in
my
opinion
its
a
fantastic
flanders
red
thats
worth
every
bit
of
the
accolades
it
gets
o
best
sour
ive
tried
from
the
bruery
definitely
a
favorite
it
finishes
up
dry
and
tart
a
perfect
beer
for
the
season
i
think
pours
a
dark
rusty
copper
tinted
brown
little
to
no
head
scent
brings
moderate
amounts
of
vinegar
with
cherry
leather
and
dark
bread
taste
has
initial
rush
of
vinegar
tartness
develops
with
cherry
slightly
vinous
apple
leather
and
dark
yeasty
bread
medium
bodied
lower
carbonation
than
many
in
the
style
a
good
thing
solid
not
quite
spectacular
o
probably
the
funkiest
flanders
red
ive
had
with
only
moderate
tartness
still
a
very
tasty
take
on
the
style
overall
very
nice
brew
nice
complexity
as
far
as
the
style
goes
anyways
enjoyed
more
as
it
warmed
and
the
more
i
drank
funny
how
that
often
happens
o
very
good
no
major
flaws
and
a
treat
to
drink
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
slight
fruit
vinegar
and
woody
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
quality
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
aromas
and
flavors
o
excellent
beer
great
sourness
and
lots
more
earthy
flavor
than
i
figured
it
would
have
will
do
again
if
i
get
the
chance
overall
really
enjoyed
this
bruery
beer
its
a
really
tasty
flanders
red
really
liking
this
beer
style
more
and
more
lately
thanks
for
bring
this
to
the
bruery
tasting
duff
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
had
a
ng
enigma
the
night
before
which
this
beer
reminded
me
of
but
just
wasnt
as
good
imo
do
very
refreshing
flemish
red
we
all
found
it
to
be
similar
to
new
glarus
enigma
thanks
beerandraiderfan
o
lots
of
flavor
with
a
good
sour
tartness
still
not
my
favorite
as
far
as
sours
go
just
a
small
step
away
from
a
solid
4
in
my
book
d
like
it
even
more
than
my
first
sampling
back
in
march
this
is
a
superflavorful
somewhataccessible
sour
base
from
the
bruery
that
makes
me
yearn
a
bit
for
the
sourcherry
variant
o
this
is
a
refreshing
and
delicate
beer
the
fruit
tartness
is
prevalent
but
just
a
touch
subtle
too
which
works
well
with
the
delicate
nature
of
the
beer
and
the
beer
finishes
with
just
enough
leather
and
funk
to
make
me
want
more
nice
work
once
again
theres
a
reason
why
this
has
won
multiple
golds
at
the
world
beer
cup
despite
not
being
from
the
flanders
region
it
is
the
prototype
for
the
style
these
days
takes
the
traditional
style
makes
it
more
lively
puckering
all
good
things
ive
sat
on
this
bottle
of
oude
tart
for
a
couple
years
since
that
time
its
held
up
well
oude
tart
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
impresses
in
just
about
every
way
the
nose
might
be
a
tad
weak
but
it
delivers
otherwise
i
like
that
its
not
overly
sour
it
features
a
subtle
sourtart
flavor
thats
very
satisfying
this
is
very
impressive
stuff
definitely
worth
seeking
out
mediumlight
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
thats
very
slightly
puckering
nicely
tart
but
not
over
the
top
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
this
is
good
and
spot
on
for
the
style
but
i
am
not
sure
its
as
special
as
noted
in
the
score
o
another
very
nice
beer
mild
sourness
makes
this
one
easier
to
drink
for
the
nonsour
drinker
cant
say
i
would
want
an
entire
bottle
but
a
glass
was
nice
4
0
m
light
to
medium
o
quite
nice
this
is
aging
well
should
really
blossom
in
a
year
or
so
time
will
do
wonderful
things
with
this
i
hope
drinks
easier
than
duchesse
though
but
i
would
take
rodenbach
grand
cru
over
it
overall
i
think
this
is
a
well
done
beer
they
didnt
go
over
the
top
with
anything
i
would
have
liked
a
dry
finish
o
a
good
beer
to
celebrate
with
one
that
my
fiance
was
a
fan
of
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
carbonation
was
slightly
low
but
i
feel
like
it
didnt
really
detract
too
much
overall
in
the
end
of
the
day
its
how
it
tastes
a
nice
enough
beer
i
just
wished
it
tasted
as
great
as
it
smells
o
an
excellent
intro
to
sour
beer
one
of
the
better
beers
of
the
tasting
id
say
09
is
superior
but
i
have
hopes
for
11
to
evolve
overall
impression
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
ton
but
like
to
see
how
it
ages
some
of
the
characteristics
were
a
bit
dull
in
this
flanders
i
could
see
more
complexity
and
funk
coming
out
of
this
one
a
year
or
two
later
grab
a
bottle
if
you
can
d
very
drinkable
even
at
this
abv
targeted
to
sourheads
no
idea
but
this
is
one
fine
approachable
sour
that
doesnt
cross
the
line
into
folding
my
face
into
right
angles
excellent
beer
a
standard
for
flanders
ales
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it

pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
cherry
oak
lactic
acid
and
a
bit
of
funkiness
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
cherry
and
has
a
lactic
tartness
to
it
the
oak
also
comes
through
as
well
is
some
acetic
acid
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
astringency
and
leaves
some
lingering
oak
on
the
palate
medium
body
low
carbonation
theres
a
great
flow
from
the
aroma
to
the
finish
the
progression
of
flavors
just
works
really
well
i
dig
it
brilliant
sour
o
really
enjoyable
beer
from
the
bruery
not
disappointed
at
all
really
easy
drinkability
and
decent
amount
of
complexity
o
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
now
sadness
has
taken
over
what
at
first
i
compared
to
others
in
the
style
and
wanted
it
to
be
more
like
them
in
the
end
made
oude
tart
stand
alone
as
its
own
version
of
a
delightful
style
of
beer
a
wonderful
treat
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
of
the
styles
ive
ever
had
the
bruery
can
sometimes
be
hit
or
miss
but
when
they
get
it
right
its
damn
close
to
perfect
overall
its
not
living
up
to
the
hype
but
still
damn
good
93100
an
approachable
sour
with
somewhat
subdued
though
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
undeveloped
flavors
for
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
surprised
the
vinegar
tones
were
subdued
and
complimenting
rather
than
overpowering
lots
of
good
flavors
are
packed
into
this
one
that
go
together
well
along
with
the
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
i
quite
like
this
but
it
is
a
very
different
take
on
the
style
from
either
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
or
duchesse
de
bourgogne
the
fruitiness
is
unique
and
it
opens
up
really
nicely
in
the
glass
as
it
warms
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
that
blows
me
out
of
the
water
i
hope
this
gets
a
bit
more
tart
in
timeas
with
other
sour
beers
from
the
bruery
it
has
a
bit
too
much
of
a
malty
backbone
for
my
liking
overall
a
tasty
brew
but
not
one
to
be
compared
to
a
cantillon
or
the
like
very
worth
trying
and
aging
though
o
a
pretty
fantastic
sour
i
dont
get
a
ton
of
the
oak
aging
but
its
in
there
pretty
dominantly
tart
with
some
mild
dark
fruits
still
a
very
nice
american
sour
ale
pours
a
bright
mahogany
with
red
edges
nice

nice

im
glad

is

otherwise
i
would
swear
this
was
rodenbach
carbonation
is
lowmedium
a
lil
too
cheesy
for
me
but
a
decent
offering
from
cali
o
really
solid
all
around
not
overly
tart
but
very
clean
and
fruity
thanks
again
mark
o
it
is
safe
to
say
that
all
4
of
us
that
tasted
this
were
greatly
underwhelmed
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
we
felt
this
was
not
close
to
deserving
of
the
hype
maybe
some
age
would
help
this
develop
as
that
may
be
the
only
circumstance
in
which
i
would
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
cheers
all
in
all
an
excellent
beer
one
im
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
and
will
seek
out
more
of
good
stuff
a
good
representation
of
the
style
while
the
other
bruery
offerings
are
superior
wanderer
especially
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
west
coast
sours
glad
i
bought
a
few
to
cellar
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bruery
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
little
ruby
coloring
on
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
it
had
about
an
inch
of
a
yellowish
cream
colored
head
but
was
completely
void
by
the
time
it
got
to
me
it
smelled
very
tart
with
hints
of
cherry
and
warhead
candy
a
little
sweeter
than
i
expected
definitely
tart
but
not
in
the
extreme
mouth
puckering
way
slightly
acidic
and
dry
it
certainly
brings
you
back
quickly
for
another
sip
well
carbonated
im
not
a
huge
sour
fan
but
im
trying
to
appreciate
this
style
for
what
it
is
tasty
all
in
all
o
mild
taste
in
avery
nice
way
o
overall
wow
what
a
beer
i
can
understand
why
this
is
so
heavily
sought
after
excellent
lingering
sourness
here
shame
i
couldnt
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
d
drinkability
is
moderate
this
is
pretty
much
a
sipper
and
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
little
more
tartness
or
carbonation
couldve
helped
as
it
warms
the
vinegar
comes
through
even
more
which
adds
a
different
facet
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
out
of
this
and
having
it
in
company
of
goose
islands
three
sisters
this
comes
in
near
the
bottom
o
pretty
disappointed
here
was
expecting
a
far
above
average
sour
but
got
nothing
but
average
to
below
average
just
not
a
strong
enough
flavor
profile
and
enough
of
a
balanced
taste
for
it
to
be
rated
with
an
a
average
overall
great
delicious
great
tart
fruit
sour
malt
light
bready
dry
malts
and
funk
bit
sticky
and
syrupy
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
think
it
would
be
better
in
time
which
is
why
my
overall
score
is
a
bit
higher
id
rather
drink
this
than
others
i
rated
3
5
in
the
overall
field
this
is
the
2011
batch
thanks
to
janderson91
appreciate
it
i
was
hopeful
about
this
beer
and
was
completely
disappointed

no
head
almost
completely
flat
smells
like
it
might
be
a
good
sour
flanders
red
not
bad
but
nothign
that
makes
me
say
yum
either
the
taste
was
so
disappointing
i
almost
want
to
say
bland
muted
flavors
just
the
hint
of
what
a
flanders
red
tastes
like
wow
i
really
expected
more
since
i
know
the
bruery
can
make
a
good
beer
i
hope
it
was
just
an
off
bottle
because
this
was
pathetic
thank
to
kbutler1
for
whipping
this
out
at
a
weekend
tasting
moly
this
is
a
great
drink
pours
a
little
murky
and
medicinal
but
all
is
forgiven
aromatically
when
the
raspberries
and
cherries
come
out
fantastically
puckerworthy
and
tart
with
a
great
sipping
consistency
killer
stuff
worth
the
high
price
overall
great
beer
definitely
the
best
bruery
beer
ive
had
to
date
overall
excellent
beer
right
here
go
get
one
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
salivate
about
this
vintage
needs
a
lot
more
time
in
the
bottle
the
prior
release
is
much
better
but
this
bottle
might
just
need
more
time
will
have
to
review
again
pours
a
solid
and
clear
dark
brown
with
deep
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
i
can
smell
the
tart
fruit
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cap
on
this
baby
sour
cherries
lemons
sweet
brown
sugar
hints
of
vinegar
light
sherry
notes
taste
is
a
bit
more
sour
than
the
nose
lead
me
to
believe
huge
lemony
tartness
with
hints
of
barnyard
funk
hit
right
up
front
sour
cherries
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
sweep
across
the
gullet
before
finishing
with
a
lingering
sweet
sour
and
funky
aftertaste
medium
body
and
level
of
carbonation
tart
acidic
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
flanders
reds
in
general
are
a
bit
overwhelming
for
my
palate
but
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
recommended
if
you
like
your
palate
wrecked
overall
im
confused
as
to
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
and
why
it
trades
so
highly
as
well
its
good
simple
and
tasty
but
nothing
mind
blowing
i
think
i
like
marron
acidife
better
though
i
could
drink
this
often
o
this
beer
has
really
great
flavor
but
definitely
doesnt
fit
too
well
into
the
style
dark
jam
lactic
funk
and
cherry
skins
in
red
wine
are
all
pronounced
in
flavor
this
feels
like
a
deconstruction
of
the
style
by
a
master
chef
i
am
definitely
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
wish
the
volume
would
be
turned
up
a
bit
i
would
love
to
try
the
cherry
version
something
is
missing
but
i
finished
a
bottle
without
even
trying
to
if
you
like
lactic
yeast
then
youre
in
for
a
treat
what
a
solid
beer
better
than
most
traditional
belgian
examples
i
really
love
that
big
sourness
and
that
subtle
hint
of
maple
sweetness
id
love
one
of
these
for
the
cellar
age
would
do
this
wonders
o
good
beer
theres
a
limit
to
how
much
you
can
really
drink
of
it
but
its
still
enjoyable
and
something
id
drink
again
look
i
understand
this
is
bottle
conditioned
and
that
with
time
it
will
carbonate
more
and
get
more
tart
however
its
a
complete
shock
to
me
that
the
bruery
would
ship
these
bottles
out
to
consumers
like
this
to
enjoy
fresh
there
is
no
way
this
is
how
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
ill
be
sitting
on
my
other
bottles
and
hopefully
theyll
take
a
complete
180
in
a
year
or
so
o
very
good
but
more
mild
overall
than
i
might
have
expected
sour
flavor
is
most
definitely
there
but
it
is
a
very
elegant
one
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
even
my
nonsour
drinking
friend
was
enthusiastic
one
of
my
new
favorite
sours
for
sure
a
future
classic
quite
an
amazing
beer
my
first
inclination
is
to
compare
this
to
supplication
definitely
a
bit
more
round
woody
and
less
sour
than
supplication
though
o
a
truly
wonderful
flanders
style
brew
an
absolutely
fantastic
sour
great
beer
overall
good
flavor
good
balance
sweet
tart
oak
flavors
lack
of
carbonation
kills
it
though
overall
i
was
pretty
disappointed
o
very
good
beer
especially
as
it
warms
when
the
sour
notes
taper
down
a
bit
and
the
more
complex
dark
fruit
notes
begin
to
show
up
overall
this
is
the
crazy
thing
the
first
bottle
of
oude
tart
i
opened
from
my
allocation
i
thought
it
was
low
on
carbonation
and
the
flavors
muted
compared
to
the
previous
batches
not
so
with
the
bottle
i
reviewed
it
was
flavorful
had
good
carbonation
for
the
style
i
found
the
2nd
bottle
had
more
carbonation
than
any
of
the
marron
acidifie
bottles
ive
had
and
compared
favorably
to
the
oude
tarts
ive
had
on
draft
and
bottle
in
the
past
was
my
mind
playing
tricks
on
me
when
i
opened
the
first
bottle
i
cant
call
it
but
the
bottle
i
reviewed
rocked
oude
tart
is
pretty
famous
and
its
no
wonder
why
its
an
outstanding
beer
cheers
on
tap
at
the
bruery
pours
a
very
murky
dirty
waterlooking
reddish
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
ton
of
fizzy
bubbles
scent
is
acidic
vinegar
tart
notes
with
a
lot
of
wood
and
brett
cherry
really
comes
through
as
it
warms
taste
is
initially
tart
cherries
with
red
wine
vinegar
followed
by
dark
malt
flavors
and
a
heavy
wood
backbone
this
is
the
woodiest
flanders
style
ive
ever
had
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
nicely
carbed
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
tasty
glad
i
came
o
just
another
flanders
nothing
real
memorable
and
certainly
not
sour
by
my
standards
d
a
superb
flanders
easily
one
of
the
best
examples
from
the
states
i
have
had
thus
far
wonderfully
oaky
and
sour
just
the
way
i
like
it
very
well
done
skål
overall
this
was
a
nice
treat
and
i
am
glad
that
i
was
able
to
sample
a
great
american
interpretation
of
a
european
classic
well
well
balanced
drinkable
would
definitely
drink
again
but
i
dont
need
to
have
it
and
dont
plan
to
seek
it
out
for
a
repeat
visit
very
tasty
and
highly
recommend
especially
if
this
is
style
is
your
wheelhouse
there
is
not
much
to
fault
in
this
beer
the
belgians
sometimes
complain
that
the
bruery
is
merely
imitating
their
beers
but
this
sort
of
imitation
is
the
highest
form
of
flattery
light
in
body
high
in
flavor
and
with
a
nice
abv
level
this
is
a
superbly
drinkable
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
the
bruery
this
is
something
id
gladly
seek
out
again
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
hidden
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
to
try
the
oude
tart
with
sour
cherries
awhile
back
so
lets
see
how
this
one
compares
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
slight
funk
cherry
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cherry
funk
sour
and
slight
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
key
difference
between
this
brew
and
the
other
was
that
the
cherries
arent
nearly
as
pronounced
in
this
one
this
cuts
back
on
the
sourtart
aspect
of
this
one
a
little
bit
however
this
one
is
still
quite
enjoyable
the
aroma
and
flavor
here
are
quite
well
balanced
and
keep
you
guessing
on
what
the
overwhelming
note
will
be
the
next
time
you
go
in
for
a
sip
definitely
worth
trying
or
getting
your
hands
on
overall
i
quite
like
it
a
wellrounded
beer
tasty
enough
though
i
wouldnt
mind
a
touch
more
funkiness
from
something
like
brettanomyces
but
that
would
certainly
put
this
outside
the
modern
interpretation
of
a
flemish
sour
i
definitely
like
the
body
of
this
brew
it
has
some
texture
to
it
but
it
is
still
fairly
quaffable
and
the
zippy
carbonation
helps
to
lighten
things
up
enough
i
feel
like
i
shouldnt
like
this
as
much
as
i
am
as
it
seems
to
be
lacking
in
complexity
but
damn
i
am
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
the
flavors
are
so
well
integrated
and
the
oak
wine
notes
are
at
such
a
soft
integrated
level
that
just
makes
this
beer
work
quite
well
really
it
is
the
oak
wine
notes
that
make
this
beer
in
the
end
without
them
this
beer
would
really
need
something
or
it
wouldnt
be
nearly
as
tasty
as
it
is
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
strikes
me
as
somewhat
akin
to
a
very
acidic
rodenbach
grand
cru
pours
a
dark
golden
red
which
a
redish
mocha
head
it
smells
tart
with
hints
of
leather
and
brettanomyces
it
tastes
fantastically
of
cherries
very
tart
and
funky
excellent
after
taste
as
well
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
this
brew
is
extremely
efferverscent
and
very
drinkable
overall
and
excellent
beer
o
a
phenomenal
oud
bruin
from
a
great
american
brewery
superb
stuff
d
unlike
many
sours
this
stuff
i
can
just
go
right
through
the
flavor
is
so
balanced
it
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
cant
wait
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
year
from
the
rs
probably
the
best
flanders
ive
had
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
id
kill
to
have
regular
access
to
this
glad
i
celebrated
300
with
this
a
drinkable
beer
again
from
a
company
that
keeps
impressing
me
d
i
thought
this
was
an
awesome
flanders
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
this
is
the
second
best
bruery
beer
ive
had
too
only
behind
black
tuesday
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
one
drink
was
very
good
now
i
know
why
i
was
trying
to
trade
for
this
for
so
long
i
quess
i
dont
have
to
now
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
poured
a
dark

color
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
bubbly

nose
it
had
a
big

alongside
oaky
funky
barrel
vinous
and
mild
acidic
notes
the
vinegar
and
vinous
flavor
are
more
apparent
on
the
palate
with
cherries
oaky
funky
and
dark
fruit
accents
but
with
mild
acidic
tart
character
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
fruity
acidic
oaky
and
tart
finish
i
really
really
liked
the
oude
tart
with
cherries
but
the
regular
ot
is
a
damn
solid
flanders
oud
bruin
it
drank
good
and
was
tasty
tart
and
mouth
puckering
sweet
without
being
overly
acidic
very
vinous
with
a
prominent
earthy
oak
tannis
character
nicely
balanced
with
the
perfect
combo
of
earthy
oak
tannis
vinous
dark
fruit
and
tart
sourness
hints
of
grape
tart
dark
cherries
and
other
berries
again
as
in
the
aroma
the
oak
presence
is
prominent
and
adds
to
the
complexity
sweet
and
vinous
with
subtle
vanilla
from
the
oak
tart
puckering
finish
with
subtle
vinegar
sourness
that
leaves
me
craving
another
sip
a
very
complex
quaffable
and
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
d
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
like
above
not
too
sweet
not
too
sour
which
makes
for
a
nice
drinkable

aroma
of
sour

sour

sweet

flavor

with

very
easy
to

for
a
sour
tasty
drinkability
is
decent
the
tartness
never
becomes
overpowering
and
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
but
fairly
basic
d
a
really
boring
and
great
beer
it
had
so
much
going
on
but
it
was
drinking
like
a
champ
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
to
get
into
the
style
overall
a
different
take
on
a
tradition
flanders
but
still
very
well
done
most
flanders
have
an
intense
vinegar
acidity
where
as
the
lactic
sourness
in
this
beer
was
more
on
line
with
a
lot
of
the
american
wild
ales
i
have
had
even
though
it
was
different
i
still
loved
this
beer
just
dont
expect
a
huge
vinegar
presence
highly
recommended
d
big
fan
of
this
one
refreshing
yet
slightly
abrasive
with
deliciousness
at
times
would
have
no
problem
sipping
on
a
whole
bottle
of
this
myself
4
5
d
definitely
a
solid
beer
easily
the
best
bruery
beer
ive
had
thus
far
though
that
isnt
saying
a
lot
given
the
garbage
ive
had
in
any
case
i
definitely
would
like
to
drink
this
again
solid
all
around
and
goes
down
easy
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
finally
got
to
try
this
and
it
did
not
dissappoint
the
best
thing
about
bruery
beers
is
their
great
body
and
mouthfeel
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
pour
is
cola
brown
with
a
creamy
slowly
dissipating
beige
head
the
smell
while
reminesect
of
rodenbach
is
earthier
taste
is
along
the
lines
of
an
aged
rodenbach
not
the
grand
cru
body
is
smooth
carbonation
great
drinkability
is
super
all
in
all
this
really
reminds
me
more
of
a
flanders
red
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
so
its
obvious
that
when
this
beer
is
in
my
mouth
my
taste
buds
are
happy
but
how
exactly
does
it
feel
well
the
medium
body
is
lush
and
never
compromising
and
the
lively
carbonation
makes
it
feel
lighter
and
much
more
enjoyable
all
around
this
beer
is
so
close
to
perfect
in
just
about
every
way
and
the
taste
makes
it
the
best
flanders
style
beer
ive
ever
had
just
wonderful
stuff
cant
wait
to
drink
it
again
i
wish
this
was
more
available
than
it
is
it
was
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
which
isnt
the
best
glass
for
getting
a
good
nose
on
it
but
i
do
remember
the
very
evident
sour
funk
to
it
not
in
a
bad
way
this
one
has
everything
the
style
demands
but
in
a
bolder
more
intense
inyourface
west
coast
usa
fashion
i
dig
it
d
i
could
have
easily
done
this
one
solo
an
easy
drinking
sour
not
nearly
as
sour
as
some
of
the
other
brews
we
cracked
but
overall
a
solid
brew
that
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
amazing
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
review
is
from
notes
and
coincidently
today
i
received
a
bottle
from
a
trade
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
was
very
high
the
sourness
is
not
overbearing
meaning
i
could
have
a
couple
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
outstanding
brew
and
it
rankied
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
our
night
skal
drinkability
complex
and
sour
very
flavorful
tasty
treat
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
i
was
pretty
excited
that
it
showed
up
at
this
tasting
oude
tart
appears
a
brown
shade
with
an
average
sized
head
and
adequate
lacing
the
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
aroma
with
scents
of
brettanomyces
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
no
doubt
there
is
a
slight
vinegar
edge
to
the
finish
that
i
find
to
be
a
tad
harsh
though
not
totally
distracting
by
any
means
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
really
look
forward
to
having
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
redamber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
tart
cherries
with
some
oak
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
tart
cherries
with
some
oak
very
drinkable
and
very
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
low
end
of
medium
bodied
perfectly
carbonated
to
a
medium
level
abv
well
hidden
great
beer
and
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
style
to
date
incredible
that
the
bruery
is
doing
such
great
things
this
early
in
their
existence
drinkability
a
marvelously
refreshing
beer
and
a
very
good
one
at
only
7
5
this
ones
not
too
much
of
a
sipper
and
i
refilled
my
glass
from
the
communal
bottle
thrice
to
get
the
entirety
of
this
review
a
great
beer
to
start
this
tasting
on
with
lots
of
interesting
notes
a
nice
cleansing
acidity
but
nothing
too
powerful
too
intense
or
too
overpowering
recommended
m
d
smooooth
even
with
a
notable
carbonation
it
drinks
very
clean
and
easily
a
bit
of
a
higher
alcohol
content
than
i
might
have
expected
but
certainly
well
hidden
d
this
is
another
fine
effort
from
the
bruery
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
at
7
5
to
be
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
scary
with
its
smoothness
dont
notice
the
alcohol
and
the
flavors
here
just
entice
you
to
take
sip
after
sip
a
very
nice
oud
bruin
really
enjoying
this
beer
on
a
nice
crisp
early
summer
evening
really
glad
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
thanks
again
barry
d
this
is
a
extremely
drinkable
beer
even
though
it
doesnt
have
the
highest
abv
it
still
hit
me
pretty
good
because
of
how
drinkable
it
was
i
think
the
bruery
did
a
great
job
with
this
style
and
i
wish
i
could
have
got
some
bottles
of
this
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
want
more
of
it
light
in
body
and
pretty
carbonated
on
the
mouth
good
palate
cleansing
beer
overall
forward
mild
sweetness
and
back
a
nice
tartness
moderate
acetic
character
with
a
brightness
to
it
some
citric
and
lactic
character
as
well
one
of
the
best
bruins
out
there
overall
goes
down
easy
enough
this
is
decent
but
i
would
reach
for
a
la
folie
or
others
first
i
am
bumping
my
score
a
bit
as
the
new
batch
is
improved
good
balanced
flavors
d
this
is
a
very
good
well
balanced
oud
bruin
overall
dthis
is
a
well
balanced
sour
lots
of
oak
up
front
the
sweetness
balances
out
the
sour
quite
well
j
the
mouthfeel
borders
on
perfect
though
it
is
just
little
lighter
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
very
well
carbonated
though
drinkability
is
huge
because
i
could
easily
get
through
2
750s
of
this
one
was
simply
not
enough
classic
red
but
better
i
often
find
rodenbach
to
have
a
bit
to
much
sweetness
this
red
does
not
have
that
problem
dark
brownish
red
light
tan
thin
head
aroma
of
dark
berries
sweet
oak
lightly
acitic
hit
you
right
off
the
bat
the
aroma
is
nice
but
not
overwhelming
or
too
strong
the
flavor
is
balanced
between
sweet
malts
and
tartness
and
acidity
from
the
yeast
and
barrel
aging
flavors
of
vanilla
light
caramel
are
very
clear
also
dark
berries
plentry
of
oak
and
a
little
leather
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
the
pleasant
carbonation
level
body
and
tartness
match
up
well
i
am
so
happy
to
have
had
this
and
so
sad
that
it
is
not
a
year
rounder
pours
a
rusty
redwood
with
a
silky
tan
head
nose
has
sour
cherries
ripe
plums
barnyard
funk
oak
and
dry
red
wine
taste
has
tart
cherries
up
front
through
the
finish
followed
by
sweet
pitted
fruits
wood
and
musty
farmyard
funk
crisp
clean
body
has
a
tart
and
acidic
finish
another
style
well
doen
by
the
bruery
drinkability
masterfully
handled
fruit
character
that
is
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
and
tart
elements
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
certainly
wish
id
purchased
more
when
i
had
the
chance
a
really
nice
beer
id
be
very
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
its
quite
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
very
old
world
in
nature
while
it
doesnt
have
the
breadth
of
flavors
that
something
like
goudenband
has
for
the
first
vintage
this
is
an
exceptionally
executed
beer
very
well
done
patrick
and
co
d
highly
drinkable
nice
acidity
without
being
overly
dry
the
creaminess
is
a
nice
touch
wellbalanced
flavors
all
around
enjoying
this
very
much
but
still
have
to
give
top
honors
to
my
faves
haandbakk
and
oerbier
reserva
makes
a
nice
pairing
with
a
washed
rind
cheese
very
nice
beer
good
drinkability
terrific
example
of
the
style
stellar
period
its
a
flanders
oud
bruin
style
and
7
5
it
is
also
aged
18
months
in
cabernet
barrels
its
a
beautiful
clear
copper
brick
red
color
it
had
a
light
cherry
aroma
a
hint
of
funk
and
lots
of
wood
it
was
a
strong
sour
at
first
that
fades
into
a
delightful
sweetness
very
complex
this
is
the
type
of
sour
i
truly
enjoy
it
is
a
bit
reminiscent
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
which
we
just
had
overall
this
beer
is
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
think
it
will
continue
to
get
more
sour
it
is
drinkable
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
time
does
to
this
beer
well
done
drinkable
absolutely
this
tasted
cleaner
than
i
had
expected
d
this
was
good
but
i
think
i
prefer
red
poppy
d
very
enjoyable
it
gets
a
touch
acetic
and
vinegary
by
the
end
of
a
glass
but
i
could
probably
have
the
bottle
on
my
own
looking
forward
to
more
sour
brews
from
the
bruery
d
pretty
solid
beer
this
was
a
very
solid
take
on
an
oude
bruin
being
well
balanced
with
the
wood
character
and
achieving
just
the
right
amount
of
pucker
in
the
mouth
i
really
enjoyed
this
bottle
d
pretty
good
not
world
class
but
solid
and
drinkable
d
this
is
where
this
beer
shines
id
like
to
think
ive
had
my
fair
share
of
flanders
reds
and
this
one
take
the
cake
with
balance
everything
works
so
well
together
in
this
beer
where
la
folie
is
tongue
twisting
sour
or
the
duchesse
is
a
bit
too
sweet
this
beer
is
just
silly
balanced
if
you
get
a
chance
try
this
beer
d
like
i
said
i
had
this
thrice
and
enjoyed
it
too
bad
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
around
to
uploading
a
review
this
is
genuinely
good
and
its
making
me
catch
on
to
what
everyone
else
seems
to
know
already
the
bruery
is
worth
watching
id
buy
a
bottle
of
this
and
then
weep
silently
because
i
cant
eat
for
a
week
d
a
surprise
for
me
to
be
sure
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
from
the
start
but
wasnt
quite
expecting
the
exceptional
brew
that
i
got
excellently
balanced
with
a
nice
complexity
that
is
easy
to
appreciate
due
to
its
not
being
overwhelming
very
tasty
and
i
hope
ill
get
the
chance
to
revisit
this
one
again
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
flanders
as
its
plenty
sweet
with
the
cherries
with
enough
brett
to
balance
it
but
not
so
much
as
to
dominate
excellent
d
very
drinkable
for
a
sour
tart
enough
to
be
applicable
to
the
style
yet
sweet
and
complex
enough
to
remain
interesting
for
the
duration
i
might
have
been
prejudiced
by
my
foam
observations
but
the
feel
was
pretty
bacterial
and
lactic
its
a
sour
i
know
but
i
was
reminded
of
where
these
acids
were
coming
from
when
i
saw
the
foam
clumps
the
carbonation
was
also
very
high
which
i
didnt
see
as
a
bad
thing
it
made
it
a
bit
difficult
to
take
a
good
hearty
sip
though
overall
i
was
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
as
it
does
a
very
good
job
of
straddling
the
tartsweet
line
well
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
very
approachable
flanders
oud
bruin
not
too
funky
or
sour
and
very
balanced
all
around
probably
the
closest
i
have
had
to
the
belgian
counterparts
hazy
reddishamber
body
with
a
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
head
atop
the
head
settles
to
a
crown
leaving
only
a
small
film
on
top
the
nose
is
sharp
and
cherrylike
light
acetic
acid
backed
by
a
subtle
dark
malt
foundation
the
ripe
cherry
aroma
is
pretty
awesome
it
tastes
toasty
and
sour
balsamic
vinegarlike
acetic
acid
at
a
perfect
level
cherrylike
esters
are
prominent
on
the
palate
though
theres
not
much
sweetness
its
a
dry
woody
and
tannic
beer
especially
in
the
finish
this
exceeded
my
expectations
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
this
style
overall
this
beer
was
really
nice
and
a
great
american
interpretation
on
a
flanders
oud
bruin
the
bruery
has
crafted
a
fine
beverage
here
recommended
a
really
delicious
beer
pretty
amazing
beer
pours
hazy
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
lot
of
tan
head
smells
of
tart
cherries
green
apple
a
dash
of
vinager
and
has
an
earthy
mineral
quality
that
i
cant
really
articulate
any
better
than
that
not
quite
leather
but
sort
of
like
it
tastes
like
a
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
cherries
and
apples
and
a
perfect
balance
of
dry
yet
slightly
sweet
not
overly
astringent
or
sour
in
fact
the
sourness
is
very
mild
medium
bodied
fairly
high
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
bruery
this
is
not
among
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
split
the
bottle
with
another
person
and
it
went
down
very
easy
recommended
thanks
to
skuter
for
the
bottle
this
was
a
treat
pours
with
a
lightly
dense
finger
thick
foam
cap
body
is
like
a
reddishbrown
my
notes
say
it
smelled
of
cherry
and
wood
the
taste
was
tart
shocker
with
an
overall
sour
cherry
flavor
and
wood
tannins
thats
all
i
wrote
down
as
i
was
losing
my
focus
by
this
time
d
an
almost
perfect
sour
beer
it
has
a
little
something
for
everyone
tart
sweet
spicy
winey
citrus
and
oak
whew
incredible
drinkability
pretty
damned
tasty
stuff
and
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
the
beer
has
a
nice
solid
base
and
the
perfect
level
of
sour
really
tasty
brew
that
im
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
thanks
much

it

truly
a

what
the

is
doing
so
far
so
good
everything
has
lived
up
to
and
exceed
my
expectations
draugh
at
the
bruery
redbrown
with
a
big
beige
head
oaky
tart
fruity
aroma
with
some
vinegar
and
burnt
fig
the
wine
barrel
influence
really
sets
this
appart
from
gypsey
tart
and
the
sourness
is
about
perfect
making
it
very
drinkable
but
clean
and
dry
in
the
finish
while
having
a
nice
malt
character
up
front
a
little
mellow
for
a
toptier
american
sour
ale
but
the
flavor
complexity
is
there
killer
with
food
drinkability
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
drinking
sour
ive
ever
had
i
could
drink
this
all
day
well
until
i
pass
out
anyway
if
not
for
the
relatively
high
price
tag
and
abv
ill
drink
this
like
im
drinking
water
edit
patrick
bmed
me
with
some
helpful
information
that
has
resolved
my
question
re
flanders
red
vs
oud
bruin
methinks
there
are
a
few
reds
that
are
currently
misclassified
this
was
the
first
release
for
2010
for
the
bruery
and
i
was
greatly
impressed
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
made
by
tyler
and
the
bruery
gang
and
it
has
been
aging
in
the
red
wine
barrels
for
18
months
so
far
a
great
start
to
2010
with
the
release
of
this
delicious
beer
high
drinkability
overall
a
great
flemish
red
not
quite
top
100
level
as
the
current
ravg
puts
it
but
very
good
the
dark
cherry
was
the
standout
nose
followed
closely
by
oak
the
taste
was
a
very
similar
story
and
the
dry
cabernetesque
taste
almost
vaporized
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
nice
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
dont
know
if
i
could
tell
this
beer
from
lafolie
which
is
by
no
means
an
insult
i
love
the
hell
out
of
that
beer
i
just
really
hoped
for
a
characteristic
to
grab
me
by
the
booboo
d
outstanding
the
bruerys
made
another
great
sour
more
classic
and
traditional
in
flavour
than
the
sour
in
the
rye
which
was
great
in
itself
a
beer
to
give
rodenbach
grand
cru
a
run
for
its
money
d
a
very
nice
example
of
a
flanders
redbrown
ale
some
people
compared
it
to
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
less
oaky
and
vinous
and
a
bit
more
drinkable
i
plan
to
drink
these
bottles
fairly
soon
as
they
taste
wonderful
now
yum
that
is
all
by
far
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
this
place
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
excellent
light
lactic
tartness
with
dark
fruitmalt
balance
this
is
the
best
american
flanders
red
i
have
had
very
well
put
together
beer
cant
wait
to
get
a
few
bottles
d
i
could
probably
drink
one
more
and
then
another
its
pretty
delicious
and
with
the
oak
notes
present
it
probably
would
setup
well
for
aging
quite
spoton
for
a
classic
flemish
style
fairly
handily
the
most
authentic
american
take
on
it
that
i
have
tasted
undoubtedly
the
long
eighteen
month
maturation
in
oak
had
great
results
eighteen
months
ago
the
bruery
had
only
just
begun
brewing
and
to
have
this
kind
of
dedication
so
early
on
speaks
volumes
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
as
it
is
lots
of
cherry
and
tartness
that
appeals
to
my
american
sensibilities
but
also
an
impressive
version
of
a
classic
style
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
i
predict
big
things
for
it
eminently
drinkable
nice
lively
mouthfeel
well
this
is
officially
the
worst
flanders
red
that
i
have
ever
sampled
not
malty
like
a
flanders
red
should
be
not
sour
heck
not
even
much
of
a
light
tartness
tasting
alot
of
oak
barrel
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
overall
impression
is
bland
and
unwhelming
sad
that
this
beer
is
a
tribute
to
such
an
awesome
historical
beer
figure
as
michael
jackson
were
you
trying
to
insult
the
poor
guy
by
brewing
this
beer
it
was
not
much
of
a
tribute
that
is
for
sure
the
flavor
has
dried
fruit
and
mild
cherrylike
tanginess
with
slight
burnt
piecrust
flavor
from
the
maltvienna
if
i
had
to
guess
with
slight
nutty
accent
and
mild
medicinal
element
from
the
yeast
with
tangy
flavors
but
not
exactly
extremely
sour
mildly
herbal
and
pithy
type
bitter
flavor
comes
through
in
the
dry
finish
overall
i
was
glad
i
got
to
try
this
a
pretty
decent
flanders
red
with
nice
wild
yeast
character
and
dry
quality
with
come
complexity
and
mild
alcohol
presence
with
a
gentle
wood
tannin
in
taste
recommended
note
2012
vintage
od
a
confusing
take
on
the
flemmish
red
style
quite
tasty
and
complex
with
some
odd
notes
but
overall
a
pretty
tasty
one
i
think
this
was
about
30
so
im
a
bit
confused
on
the
hyperarity
but
im
trying
to
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
what
it
is
is
good
o
i
had
no
idea
how
this
was
going
to
be
going
into
it
but
i
was
actually
fairly
impressed
by
no
means
did
it
blow
me
away
or
would
i
say
it
was
my
favorite
flanders
but
it
was
definitely
a
quality
beer
worth
trying
ill
reiterate
that
this
beer
is
horribly
overpriced
though
i
was
kind
of
forced
into
purchasing
it
via
the
anniversary
pack
its
not
particularly
offensive
but
its
very
weak
for
a
flanders
red
my
bottle
was
actually
nicely
carbonated
and
had
a
lovely
garnet
body
woody
muted
tart
cherry
vanilla
oak
not
something
i
would
pony
up
for
in
the
future
low
d
above
average
good
to
try
shared
a
bottle
with
my
wife
the
beer
is
red
but
very
cloudy
the
nose
is
brett
funk
seems
somewhat
unrefined
the
beers
tastes
is
unrefined
sweet
malt
with
brett
funk
a
very
odd
finish
almost
alcohol
with
a
strange
bitterness
this
tastes
like
the
first
time
i
used
brett
in
a
homebrew
a
complete
mess
very
unimpressed
overall
never
again
hotd
i
think
i
have
one
or
two
more
of
your
beers
in
the
cellar
but
after
that
im
done
between
this
and
the
recent
batch
of
flat
doggie
claws
i
feel
completely
ripped
off
paying
such
stupid
amounts
of
money
for
flat
or
virtually
flat
beer
too
bad
since
matt
was
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
oh
well
there
are
plenty
of
consistent
great
beers
out
there
to
spend
my
hard
earned
cash
on
overall
a
subpar
beer
from
hotd
with
their
quality
issues
who
knows
if
this
beer
was
actually
supposed
to
taste
like
this
not
something
i
would
have
an
interest
in
trying
again
the
beer
pours
a
rusty
brown
color
with
a
very
loose
offwhite
head
that
fades
without
lacing
the
nose
is
pit
fruity
floral
slightly
vinous
with
very
little
alcohol
4
the
taste
is
definitely
fruity
and
sweet
upfront
consistent
with
the
nose
followed
by
a
faintly
woody
finish
there
is
not
nearly
enough
oak
or
dryness
im
assuming
it
would
probably
dry
outbecome
more
complex
with
a
bit
of
age
which
would
make
the
mouthfeel
quite
supreme
this
is
a
delicious
flanders
a
bit
too
sweet
but
with
lots
if
subtle
fruit
flavor
and
great
potential
hair
of
the
doggie
has
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
is
a
whiff
flat
not
very
flavorful
expensive
03
doesnt
even
touch
mediocre
not
a
good
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
so
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
felt
it
is
missing
some
vinegar
and
more
sour
cherry
notes
indicative
of
the
style
but
collectively
its
pretty
nice
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
focus
on
barrel
character
but
this
was
a
nice
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
of
a
big
take
on
a
flanders
red
i
was
a
little
suspect
of
how
this
would
work
but
i
am
happily
surprised
another
delicious
beer
from
hair
of
the
dog
big
fruit
and
a
little
funkiness
and
souring
also
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
not
overwhelming
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
goes
very
nicely
with
a
cheese
plate
or
even
a
good
stew
warming
comforting
and
at
the
same
time
very
fresh
tasting
it
wouldve
been
a
little
better
had
it
been
slightly
more
tart
but
it
was
still
pretty
damn
good
easily
drinkable
and
refreshing
im
not
sure
how
old
this
one
was
but
i
think
it
had
some
age
on
it
nice
winelike
characteristics
and
a
big
contribution
from
the
oak
barrel
d
a
bit
more
oak
and
acetic
than
i
like
more
flanders
beers
but
miles
better
than
it
was
on
release
alans
beers
are
built
to
age
and
this
was
no
exception
enjoyable
at
this
stage
but
still
only
a
good
take
on
the
style
id
drink
it
again
poured
a
burnt
brownish
orange
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
barely
left
any
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
plenty
of
sweet
fruity
aromas
upfront
on
the
nose
consisting
of
cherries
dark
fruit
with
a
little
vinous
character
subtle
vinegar
good
acidicy
and
nice
oaky
wood
presence
the
dark
fruit
were
more
apparent
on
the
palate
with
great
cherry
fruit
accents
vinous
barrel
character
oaky
wood
notes
with
plenty
of
acidicy
lingering
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
fruity
acidic
semi
sweet
oaky
mild
vinegary
and
tart
finish
good
lookin
out
beezler
on
this
bottle
drank
good
and
was
solid
all
around
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
amazing
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
4
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
overall
enjoyment
and
drinkability
i
know
this
may
have
improved
if
i
had
aged
it
but
i
am
getting
weary
of
breweries
releasing
beers
that
are
not
ready
to
drink
straightaway
if
its
not
ready
dont
sell
it
guys
oit
was
a
good
beer
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurt
how
good
this
beer
could
have
been
o
a
bit
of
a
letdown
flavor
was
ok
not
as
assertive
or
tart
as
i
was
hoping
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
what
really
killed
it
for
me
though
o
over
oaked
a
little
restraint
with
the
barrel
and
more
carbonation
would
improve
this
substantially
o
the
balance
is
key
here
i
cannot
stand
when
this
style
is
overly
acetic
or
overly
sweet
rarely
do
i
find
one
this
well
balanced
im
very
impressed
this
is
much
better
than
past
vintages
ive
had
big
thanks
to
aaron
for
this
one
served
in
a
hair
of
the
dog
tulip
nose
is
pretty
nice
with
a
good
level
of
acidity
plus
some
baking
oak
and
a
fruit
component
theres
some
cherry
along
with
mild
dark
fruits
flavor
ha
the
acidity
and
fruit
down
but
theres
way
too
much
barrel
character
as
the
tannins
are
nearly
overpowering
lightmedium
body
o
oaky
and
dark
fruit
light
body
and
cherrycitrus
o
this
spent
awhile
in
the
barrels
and
it
shows
nose
and
taste
are
very
different
but
harmonious
o
overall
interesting
glad
to
taste
it
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
the
oak
dominates
bringing
a
big
vanilla
on
the
flanders
might
be
a
better
beer
if
not
put
in
the
barrel
o
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
the
fruit
shows
well
with
some
decent
tartness
the
vinegar
in
the
bottle
i
had
wasnt
dominating
it
seems
there
is
some
bottle
variation
with
this
beer
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
to
get
a
great
one
great
us
representation
the
09
batch
was
a
little
muddled
but
this
one
is
both
heavier
on
the
funk
and
sour
with
brighter
more
intense
cherry
and
vinegar
to
boot
a
candidate
for
most
improved
beer
of
the
year
ill
be
buying
a
full
allotment
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
sour
beer
i
really
liked
the
funky
musty
flavors
in
the
aroma
the
taste
showed
a
little
too
much
sweetness
up
front
that
seemed
to
overshadow
some
of
the
funky
character
very
good
overall
though
i
wish
i
didnt
lose
half
of
it
upon
opening
o
nice
to
be
able
to
try
but
the
people
have
spoken
on
this
one
even
michael
god
rest
his
soul
would
have
thought
this
was
average
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
nice
mix
of
vinegar
sour
and
acidic
taste
comes
up
way
short
however
the
flavor
has
an
interesting
flanders
red
type
taste
up
front
but
it
finishes
very
bland
it
is
not
very
sour
at
all
has
a
little
vinegar
up
front
but
nothing
to
follow
it
up
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
falls
short
of
expectations
overall
fantastic
work
alan
once
again
a
treasure
this
just
misses
for
me
its
a
bit
too
sweet
and
i
dont
care
for
the
aftertaste
but
for
some
it
will
be
just
fine
this
was
definitely
an
experience
not
what
i
expected
at
all
from
a
flanders
red
style
beer
but
hair
of
the
dog
really
doesnt
make
anything
normal
persay
do
they
a
little
too
boozy
for
such
a
light
abv
beer
but
still
pretty
good
regardless
dont
break
you
back
to
find
this
as
it
was
fairly
unremarkable
overall
overall
a
very
solid
beer
clear
copperorange
pour
bottle
was
a
gusher
nose
is
bright
lactic
acid
salt
red
berries
metallic
decent

of

flavor
is
metallic
and
lightly
sour
light
red
fruits
light
and
bright
compared
to
many
beers
of
this
style
but
too
many
off
flavors
to
really
enjoy
this
is
typically
not
a
style
american
brewers
do
well
possibly
overall
one
of
the
least
enjoyable
styles
out
there
because
there
are
so
many
huge
misses
this
wasnt
a
huge
miss
just
mediocre
a
complex
ale
its
not
the
greatest
flanders
ever
but
it
is
interesting
updated
as
i
just
re
had
this
beer
and
its
getting
better
and
better
it
has
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
the
age
has
definitely
helped
it
out
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
to
see
how
it
continues
to
progress
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
pretty
nice
carbonation
that
isnt
over
abundant
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
a
gusher
still
this
is
an
interesting
unique
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
overall
pretty
good
as
is
expected
from
hotd
a
tribute
to
the
beer
hunter
heard
this
one
was
a
gusher
and
they
were
right
im
usually
pretty
good
at
not
missing
my
glass
but
not
so
moose
face
pours
a
hazy
reddish
color
with
a
thin
beige

nice
barrel

not
much
in
the
nose

flavor
good
example
of
the
style
but
no
defining
qualities
thin

lacks
complexity

2009
vintage
bottle
opens
with
a
pretty
loud
pop
and
pretty
much
started

away

into
a
nb
tulip
glass
a
murky
brown
red
color
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
leaving
some
lace
the
oak
is
pretty
evident
in
the
nose
right
away
along
with
a
cider
applefruit
type
note
light
mouthfeel
with
less
carbonation
than
i
thought
given
the
gushing
of
the
bottle
slightly
sweet
and
sour
flavor
gives
way
to
a
bitter
oaky
flavor
that
lingers
on
a
bit
in
all
honesty
im
not
totally
in
love
with
this
beer
and
expected

bottle
thanks
to
scrizzz
pours
a
semihazy
dirty
brown
with
basically
no
head
just
bubbles
aroma
of
lots
of
oak
brettacidic
notes
light
sweet
malts
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
lot
of
fred
from
the
wood
flavor
is
more
sweet
just
a
touch
acidic
with
light
sour
notes
this
isnt
like
other
flanders
red
ales
that
ive
had
more
like
an
oaky
bretty
sherryish
beer
anyway
it
was
pretty
tasty
well
done
about
two
seconds
after
popping
the
cap
a
slow
gush
falls
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
waiting
glass
obviously
plenty
of
carbonation

and

taste
is
at
first
abrupt
and
sharp
with
the
acidity
of

taken
the

as
the
beer
warms
the

with

shift
to

acidic
mildly
metallic

this
overall
has
a
very
sharp
strong
and
potentially
off
putting
combination
of
flavors
but
all
things
considered
is
very
balanced
very
interesting
and
aging
nicely
i
assume
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
sourness
is
in
check
with
wood
and
funk
aromas
and
fruit
hints
both
on

and
on
the
nose
some
amount
of
balancing
sweetness
but
certainly
not
sweet
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
12
a
12ouncer
could
drink
this
happily
all
night
many
nights
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
real
pleasure
after
being
a
little
immature
last
fall
if
i
recall
correctly
and
if
im
reading
early
reviews
accurately
i
only
got
to
try
this
as
a
quick
sip
or
two
at
the
dock
sale
but
never
ventured
to
try
one
of
my
cellared
bottles
before
today
glad
i
waited
a
tasty
flanders
red
now
and
one
that
might
develop
even
further
toward
deliciousness
over
time
well
played
mr
sprints
well
played
a
fitting
tribute
to
the
beer
hunter
a
good
first
attempt
at
the
style
i
heard
this
was
flat
and
suffered
from
poor
mouthfeel
when
this
first
came
out
but
that
wasnt
the
case
with
this
bottle
d
wow
this
one
surprised
me
a
great
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
tastes
great
and
has
all
that
funksourness
i
am
beginning
to
enjoycrave
i
would
love
to
snag
a
few
more
of
these
to
see
how
it
evolves
agewise
drinkability
wonderful
on
a
hot
day
this
is
what
my
husband
and
i
would
fondly
call
a
porchsipping
beer
overall
a
very
nice
sour
and
i
couldnt
expect
more
from
such
a
fine
brewer
what
an
absolute
mess
j
d
an
excellent
beer
that
im
glad
to
be
able
to
try
one
of
the
more
noticeable
oaky
wood
flavors
ive
gotten
out
of
any
beer
works
in
this
one
although
some
might
find
it
a
bit
heavy
handed
this
is
a
style
that
i
really
enjoy
and
this
is
a
fine
example
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
fringes
of
the
style
but
well
worth
seeking
out
hv
the
after
taste
is
kind
of
odd
and
earthy
with
the
berries
sticking
around
a
bit
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
flanders
i
drank
this
kinda
quick
so
it
goes
down
easy
if
ya
like
the
sour
for
some
reason
i
did
not
want
this
to
get
to
warm
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
this
should
do
something
in
a
year
or
two
in
a
bottle
cheers
to
allen
for
tackeling
another
style
overall
not
the
most
traditional
take
on
a
flanders
red
but
very
well
done
closest
i
could
come
to
approximating
it
would
probably
be
to
compare
it
to
reinart
wild
ale
but
i
much
preferred
this
unfortunate
that
it
was
a
gusher
and
i
hope
to
try
more
of
this
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
serious
brew
and
the
flavor
and
bugs
will
take
its
toll
on
you
my
mind
and
palate
are
blown
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
without
hesitation
get
it
if
u
can
but
be
careful
when
opening
this
thing
cuz
u
could
lose
an
eye
d
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
was
interested
to
pick
out
the
nuances
of
the
beer
i
wonder
how
this
will
get
with
age
overall
an
excellent
flemish
red
ale
about
on
par
with
the
bruerys
oude
tart
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
on
the
lower
side
as
are
most
sours
for
me
due
to
the
high
tartness
overall
i
liked
this
brew
but
the
extreme
overcarbonation
and
the
weird
twang
at
the
back
of
the
throat
are
this
brews
downfall
good
not
great
skal
d
not
very
much
like
any
flanders
red
ive
had
but
very
good
nonetheless
i
feel
like
this
was
more
akin
to
a
belgian
strong
pale
in
flavor
but
that
is
a
trivial
thing
d
its
a
good
flanders
red
but
after
thinking
about
it
i
prefer
oude
tart
quite
a
bit
more
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
but
its
almost
too
thin
there
is
a
nice
dry
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
beer
normally
everything
from
hotd
i
have
is
top
notch
maybe
some
more
time
in
the
bottle
would
benefit
this
one
the
flavor
has
a
slightly
funky
tartness
in
the
beginning
that
fades
to
a
semioxidized
finish
of
wet
paper
and
mineral
water
a
pleasant
cherrylike
fruitiness
hits
in
the
middle
but
the
finish
is
just
odd
borders
on
sweaty
gym
socks
but
doesnt
quite
offend
the
palate
to
that
extent
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
juicy
with
a
metallicmedicinal
twang
and
low
carbonation
level
all
in
all
an
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
thanks
again
josh
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
i
admire
the
work
that
went
into
making
this
beer
but
its
a
shame
this
was
made
in
honor
of
michael
jackson
as
it
this
was
a
big
let
down
maybe
next
time
d
the
undercarbonation
gives
this
offering
a
flat
watery
flavor
that
strangely
adds
to
the
drinkability
although
probably
not
past
a
glass
or
two
however
somewhat
confusing
flavors
make
this
not
desirable
past
much
more
than
one
based
on
the
brewery
alone
i
would
give
it
another
shot
with
age
even
though
this
already
has
three
years
from
brew
date
great
brewery
from
which
i
will
seek
all
beer
you
cant
win
them
all
d
i
liked
it
i
think
its
a
solid
effort
maybe
a
little
too
much
hops
in
a
flanders
red
but
hey
i
love
this
style
and
i
like
that
a
western
us
brewer
is
making
it
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
i
also
think
that
it
will
benefit
from
some
more
cellar
time
perhaps
another
35
years
i
wish
i
had
more
of
it
to
test
that
theory
with
sadly
this
is
my
only
bottle
d
very
nicely
crafted
sour
not
for
the
extreme
sour
freaks
but
for
those
who
like
an
approachable
sour
it
is
a
winner
not
surprisingly
this
beer
was
a
real
gusher
it
is
cloudy
red
in
color
and
smells
not
only
sour
but
woody
tart
and
a
little
plastic
the
taste
is
odd
sour
fruit
but
not
really
reminiscent
of
a
flanders
red
this
almost
reminds
me
of
sui
generis
from
avery
its
kind
of
thin
and
the
barrel
seems
to
dominate
the
flavor
but
its
still
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
they
flanders
red
style
very
well
smell
is
tart
and
a
bit
floral
theres
more
of
the
tart
character
in
the
flavor
this
is
very
smooth
in
regards
to
mouthfeel
theres
a
strong
oak
flavor
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
honestly
had
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
michael
is
texturally
disappointing
but
i
like
the
originality
and
exotica
elsewhere
hotd
have
set
the
bar
so
high
not
everything
they
do
will
be
a
mindblower
but
i
liked
this
just
fine
and
was
really
really
thankful
for
the
chance
to
try
it
thanks
again
brian
d
theres
definitely
a
weird
taste
to
this
one
which
im
not
sure
i
like
perhaps
it
needed
a
couple
more
years
however
the
bitterness
is
noticeable
upfront
and
doesnt
really
dissipate
rather
it
becomes
more
dominant
at
the
finish
a
bit
dissapointing
but
id
definitely
like
to
try
it
again
in
a
year
or
two
d
overall
it
was
a
really
nice
flanders
and
enjoyed
this
10
times
more
than
i
did
the
first
time
im
pleased
with
the
progress
this
beer
has
made
since
november
should
only
improve
with
more
time
this
probably
isnt
the
best
flanders
red
ive
had
but
i
really
liked
this
one
even
in
its
present
state
i
think
with
some
age
this
one
will
be
even
better
as
the
brett
starts
to
work
its
magic
drinkability
this
beer
just
isnt
quite
there
yet
it
needs
some
time
to
let
everything
sort
of
mellow
and
let
the
yeastbacteria
do
its
thing
it
needs
some
of
the
sour
and
maybe
once
that
happens
this
thing
will
perk
up
a
bit
not
bad
by
any
means
just
needs
time
to
tighten
up
a
bit
thanks
much
jason
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
an
oily
vinegary
body
which
is
surprisingly
malty
very
sweet
and
vinous
with
some
tart
vinegary
sweet
dry
bretty
funk
and
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
character
lots
of
tart
dark
cherry
plum
raisin
grape
and
fig
smoothed
out
by
some
vanilla
oaky
tannis
sweet
alcohol
flavor
but
no
heatwarmth
to
speak
of
a
bit
too
sweet
and
not
as
tartpuckering
as
i
would
like
but
still
very
flavorful
and
quaffable
bottle
in
a
trade
at
ratebeer
pours
a
nice
dark
red
almost
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
tart
with
barrel
vinegar
and
spice
flavor
was
a
little
off
fruity
and
slightly
sour
but
had
a
buttery
quality
that
reminded
me
of
gargamel
this
one
might
need
to
sit
awhile
palate
was
ok
but
a
little
thin
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
might
give
it
another
go
soon
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
brown
color
with
ok
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
interesiting
with
considerable
sour
cherry
and
funk
its
not
over
done
and
theres
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
keep
the
sour
funk
in
check
but
this
beer
is
definitely
on
the
sour
side
flavors
replicate
the
nose
pretty
closely
though
theres
a
bit
more
of
a
vinegar
sour
component
then
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
theres
also
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
fruit
skin
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
finish
is
fairly
long
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
the
amount
of
sour
wears
me
out
just
a
bit
alcohol
is
well
disguised
but
the
sour
and
funk
would
always
keep
me
from
drinking
more
then
just
a
little
bit
slight
sour
nose
with
a
little
sherry
and
oak
pours
ruby
in
color
with
minimal
head
slightly
carbonated
slight
sour
in
initial
taste
with
big
oak
flavors
there
is
a
slight
sherry
flavor
to
the
beer
but
it
is
abrasive
to
the
palate
very
light
and
watered
down
any
good
flavors
fade
out
quick
and
leave
a
tealike
taste
in
your
mouth
which
equals
a
bad
aftertaste
hopefully
some
time
in
the
bottle
will
improve
this
beer
but
unfortunately
it
doesnt
seem
like
there
is
much
room
for
improvement
if
this
beer
was
sour
all
the
way
through
i
would
like
it
a
lot
better
michael
jackson
is
such
a
man
to
be
honored
but
sadly
this
beer
does
not
even
come
close
to
doing
it
it
should
be
avoided
if
you
are
a
flanders
fan
and
others
should
be
sought
out
a
swing
and
a
pop
fly
caught
in
deep
right
center
i
hope
michael
jackson
isnt
rolling
around
in
his
grave
p
drinkability
this
drinks
much
stronger
than
i
thought
would
be
the
case
for
a
6
2abv
brew
and
darn
it
the
flavours
just
dont
work
for
me
this
isnt
a
brew
that
id
seek
out
again
but
it
is
worth
a
go
if
you
have
the
chance
like
too
many
hotd
beers
this
one
is
basically
flat
and
could
benefit
from
some
carbonation
i
will
be
interested
in
seeing
how
some
time
in
the
bottle
changes
this
one
at
first
i
thought
about
rating
this
lower
but
i
enjoyed
the
last
13
of
the
bottle
so
much
that
i
had
to
bump
it
up
id
give
it
an
a
and
if
carbonation
and
funk
increases
in
the
future
an
a
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
an
all
too
low
level
of
carbonation
for
the
style
i
hope
this
beer
shows
more
carbonation
in
the
future
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
hope
to
see
improve
with
age
i
think
an
increase
in
carbonation
and
acetic
character
will
do
this
beer
well
at
this
point
12oz
is
more
than
enough
copper
reddish
body
a
bit
of
chill
haze
to
start
semiopaque
yeasty
body
and
as
with
all
hotd
beers
except
blue
dot
minimally
carbonated
however
there
was
a
significant
amount
of
carbonation
clinging
to
sides
of
glass
tart
funky
nose
representative
of
the
best
of
the
style
cherries
rainier
lapin
in
the
nose
medium
bodied
not
much
hops
to
speak
about
tart
lipsmacking
finish
though
it
will
certainly
benefit
from
a
bit
of
aging
it
taste
pretty
damn
good
right
now
not
willing
to
push
the
envelope
on
drinkability
right
now
but
this
beer
taste
damn
good
very
tasty
given
the
fact
it
was
just
bottled
about
a
month
ago
i
suspect
the
carbonation
and
funky
edge
will
pick
up
a
bit
over
time
glad
i
have
a
slew
of
this
stashed
for
my
ba
brothers
smart
enough
to
recognize
that
alan
sprints
and
his
socal
soul
brother
patirck
rue
now
thats
a
collaboration
id
like
to
see
are
on
the
cutting
edge
of
west
coast
brewing
very
good
now
and
i
suspect
with
a
bit
of
patience
something
to
pull
out
and
share
with
very
very
special
friends
no
doubt
the
beer
hunter
is
very
pleased

drinkability
a
complex
slow
sipper
that
would
go
great
with
the
right
meal
and
is
very
good
on
its
own
like
im
enjoying
it
now
again
i
think
more
time
giving
the
beer
more
carbonation
would
bump
up
this
score
the
rest
of
mine
will
be
sitting
in
the
cellar
for
awhile
overall
the
oak
wine
apple
and
sour
mingle
together
very
well
as
the
glass
empties
this
is
quickly
becoming
a
hotd
brew
i
will
not
soon
forget
on
a
closing
thought
i
would
like
mention
that
this
has
been
a
sidebyside
comparison
with
brouwerij
verhaeghes
duchesse
de
bourgogne
i
must
concede
that
the
duchesse
won
me
over
this
round
o
at
17
for
a
split
im
not
entirely
sure
i
got
my
moneys
worth
but
thats
not
to
say
it
isnt
lovely
stuff
heard
people
age
this
which
had
me
suspicious
given
its
only
5
and
has
lager
blended
in
but
now
that
i
tasted
it
im
even
more
confused
if
the
fruit
faded
anymore
it
would
be
gone
altogether
if
i
hit
the
bottle
shop
and
cant
find
anything
else
to
waste
money
on
i
may
just
put
one
away
for
a
year
or
two
glad
i
had
it
but
next
o
great
beer
i
drink
a
large
number
of
sours
and
this
one
stands
up
in
its
particular
category
it
is
aggressive
and
may
not
be
for
all
beer
drinkers
or
even
sour
drinkers
if
you
dig
the
style
go
with
a
classic
american
interpretation
of
it
2012
version
and
oh
so
wonderful
tart
and
still
very
effervescent
tasting
more
sour
than
fruity
at
this
point
but
isnt
that
the
point
of
keeping
it
until
now
o
not
bad
good
but
not
worth
16
99
for
a
375
ml
i
could
see
this
being
worth
910
maybe
12
for
a
375
ml
not
a
big
beer
complex
yes
but
the
price
knocks
me
off
it
was
worth
a
try
not
disappointed
but
not
impressed
i
am
also
not
familiar
with
flanders
red
ales
so
it
could
just
be
me
cheers
nice
sipper
for
something
different
at
least
for
me
overall
unique
and
then
some
so
much
complexity
and
flavor
in
a
5

beer
great
drinkability

amazing

have
last
years
bottles
for

would
love
to
trade
for
this

my
second
bottle
from
lost

and
it
was
everything
i
could
have
wanted
a
sipper
for
sure
outstanding
overall
this
beer
is
phenomenal
for
almost
a
session
beer
this
one
was
great
glad
i
finally
found
one
on
the
shelves
375

bottle
no
2
of
my
last
night
of
my
20s
tasting
pours
dark
reddish
brown
slightly
murky
with
a
big
airy
khaki
head
on
top
aroma
of
lots
of
cherries
sour
vinegar
oak
some
toffee
flavor
is
sour
cherries
acidic
tones
vinegar
and
an
unexpected
wave
of
chocolatey
flavors
and
vanilla
oak
tannins
earthy
spicy
undertones
interesting
medium
bodied
feeling
a
bit
heft
for
only
5
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
interesting
brew
and
pretty
unique
otasty
flanders
red
ale
with
nice
flavors
but
a
little
high
priced
for
what
you
get
relative
to
alternatives
this
beer
has
a
great
taste
which
is
defined
by
a
complex
fantastic
composition
the
flavors
are
pretty
good
but
the
carbonation
detracted
for
me
best
flanders
red
ive
ever
had
overall
i
find
myself
wanting
more
cherry
from
this
one
there
is
not
doubt
that
it
is
a
quality
flanders
but
it
is
really
not
much
different
despite
the
unique
characteristics
with
red
poppy
lost
abbey
ages
their
sour
brown
with
cherries
in
used
wine
barrels
what
comes
out
is
a
great
sour
that
really
showcases
the
essence
of
the
whole
cherry
the
skin
flesh
juice
and
even
the
pit
i
really
appreciated
the
strong
vanilla
character
imparted
by
the
oak
barrels
that
is
often
missing
in
a
lot
of
sour
beer
recommended
o
pleasure
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
if
you
like
a
sour
ale
this
is
it
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cherries
so
i
was
happy
when
the
smell
of
them
was
there
but
not
so
much
in
the
taste
taste
brought
me
back
in
time
for
some
reason
very
old
tasting
and
earthy
with
a
smooth
finish
once
you
get
past
the
initial
tart
also
tastes
a
little
winelike
my
biggest
complaint
was
the
price
of
this
bottle
i
dont
think
ill
shell
out
the
money
again
so
unfortunately
this
might
be
my
one
and
only
red
poppy
glad
i
tried
it
though
o
hugely
overpriced
to
the
point
where
it
makes
me
slightly
angry
its
about
twice
the
price
of
la
folie
per
oz
which
is
in
turn
almost
twice
the
price
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
you
get
nothing
for
that
mark
up
it
is
a
good
beer
though
its
fizzy
and
sour
which
leaves
it
feeling
pretty
harsh
very
tart
cherries
the
big
player
in
this
sour
a
very
slight
caramel
taste
a
real
fruit
flavored
sour
and
beer
one
of
the
best
sours
full
in
body
i
would
say
this
is
right
there
with
new
belgiums
la
folie
both
a
brown
ale
sour
very
comparable
overall
a
more
than
competent
offering
on
the
flanders
red
ale
style
and
one
that
i
would
gladly
buy
again
were
there
not
a
similar
option
that
i
prefer
slightly
that
is
more
readily
available
and
comes
in
a
750
ml
bottle
instead
of
a
375
ml
and
for
only
a
couple
dollars
more
still
one
that
any
fan
of
the
vast
tradition
of
sourtasting
beers
from
belgium
should
try
at
least
once
o
a
well
balanced
and
executed
ale
a
very
tart
and
fruit
forward
version
of
the
flanders
red
style
delicious
stuff
fresh
from
tap
served
in
a
tulip
glass
poured
a
light
coppery
brown
with
a
fine
head
that
lingered
smelled
tart
fruit
cherries
and
plums
moderate
to
high
carbonation
on
the
thin
side
tart
sour
cherries
with
oak
in
the
back
dry
tart
finish
im
not
overly
familiar
with
these
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
absolutely
phenomenal
take
on
this
style
by
lost
abbey
i
wish
it
was
a
little
less
expensive
but
well
worth
it
to
taste
this
beer
i
have
to
say
i
like
this
better
than
the
classic
of
this
beer
style
duchesse
not
going
to
do
the
average
rating
all
im
going
to
say
is
this
is
a
fresh
2014
bottle
i
had
a
13
semi
fresh
bottle
maybe
23
months
after
it
was
released
last
year
and
it
was
great
this
years
needs
a
little
age
on
it
but
it
can
easily
be
a
high
4
with
some
age
o
good
beer
that
will
satisfy
your
sour
craving
the
balance
of
cherry
and
oak
is
very
nice
the
attention
to
detail
in
this
beer
is
very
apparent
it
would
be
amazing
if
it
had
a
bigger
since
of
caramel
but
other
than
that
im
satisfied
i
would
recommend
and
buy
again
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
quickly
dissipating
cherrytinged
head
aromas
of
sour
cherry
melon
and
funk
with
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
gobs
of
sour
on
the
tongue
followed
by
dark
stone
fruit
very
dry
on
the
finish
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
complex
and
refreshing
flanders
red
ale
overall
so
close
to
being
really
good
but
just
too
much
metal
taste
i
might
try
getting
another
bottle
and
letting
it
age
to
see
if
that
flavor
mellows
out
but
as
it
stands
there
are
lots
of
better
sours
out
there
certainly
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
real
treat
for
something
delicious
and
unusual
d
really
great
beer
deep
sourness
rounded
out
by
wheat
o
tart
and
oaky
with
not
much
of
the
cherry
showing
not
my
style
of
beer
i
think
it
is
a
solid
flanders
red
appearance
dark
murky
brown
ale
light
head
heavy
on
the
carbonation
smell
sour
cherries
and
good

taste
sharp
light

fast
acidic

no

very
clean
mouth
feel
light
and
acidic
reddish
brown
body
with
some
light
white
lacing
smells
of
tartness
on
the
nose
not
really
getting
the
cherry
in
the
nose
or
in
the
body
the
acidity
drowns
out
most
of
the
flavors
i
was
hoping
for
given
the
pricepoint
id
expect
more
balance
more
cherry
flavor
very
acidic
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
o
very
well
rounded
beer
the
smell
hit
me
immediately
and
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
get
this
beer

another
solid
offering
from

i
think
that
they
picked
it
up
spot
on
with
the
combination
of
brown
ale
and
sour
cherry
flavors
i
picked
up
a
bottle
on
a
recent
trip
to
san
diego
and
wish
that
i
had
about
three
more
definitely
recommended
o
overall
a
very

red
tons
of
cherry
plenty
of
tart
nice
woody
notes
and
earthy
funk
balance
of
these
aspects
is
very
good
dont
buy
this
often
enough

definitely
a

at

i
thought
it
wasnt

easily
drinkable
due
to
the

as

and
the
more

flavors
come
through
the

becomes

and

found
the

to

the
tart
cherries
and
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
roll
through
first
but
the
beer
transitions
into
crisp
tart
sourness
there
is
a
nice
oaky
character
and
an
overall
crispness
the
body
is
medium
with
nice
carbonation
making
it
smooth
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
very
smooth
and
a
nice
balance
of
residual
sweetness
and
tart
dry
sourness
a
very
strong
example
of
the
style
overall
it
really
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
to
be
honest
i
am
quite
surprised
given
i
am
a
real
belgian
enthusiast
and
many
of
these
north
american
breweries
never
seem
to
usually
nail
sours
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
but
more
fruity
and
slightly
less
sour
yet
is
certainly
not
far
removed
no
joke
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
flanders
sour
sweet
tart
cherries
and
a
beautiful
yeast
strain
o
not
a
homerun
at
least
not
at
this
point
its
pretty
good
but
ive
definitely
had
a
bunch
of
flanders
reds
ive
preferred
i
think
this
may
do
well
with
some
age
though
and
a
couple
are
in
the
cellar
for
future
dates
d
not
bad
other
than
the
mildly
offputting
aroma
probably
suffered
being
consumed
next
to
rodenbachs
sublime
caractère
rouge
although
its
not
a
very
fair
comparison
as
this
doesnt
have
fruit
in
it
id
be
willing
to
try
this
again
down
the
road
to
see
if
the
sulfur
clears
up
or
the
acidity
intensifies
brilliant
brewery
alert
just
once
id
like
to
be
below
the
average
for
one
one
of
my
driftwood
ratings
call
me
a
homer
but
i
had
to
trade
to
get
this
one
thanks
chickenm
for
this
gem
and
eskimodave
need
some
props
for
allowing
me
to
taste
what
i
assume
will
be
a
great
cellar
addition
o
bird
of
prey
is
another
outstanding
offering
from
driftwood
and
an
excellent
introduction
to
sours
high
drinkability
and
it
ages
very
well
thanks
rutager
o
well
done
but
its
not
much
of
session
beer
nice
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
this
might
get
me
into
trying
more
flanders
reds
i
am
a
novice
to
sour
beers
so
i
cant
describe
all
the
flavors
but
i
really
like
whats
going
on
the
beer
is
excellently
balanced
and
really
drinkable
o
more
of
a
subtle
and
balanced
beer
than
i
had
anticipated
the
oak
flavour
really
comes
through
which
is
nice
other
than
the
thin
viscosity
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
hope
that
more
british
columbian
brewers
continue
to
branch
out
into
sour
styles
overall
this
is
awesome
a
really
nice
sour
with
full
great
flavours
complex
and
refined
another
winner
from
driftwood
ill
admit
im
still
working
on
understanding
and
appreciating
the
differences
between
the
various
sour
styles
im
not
sure
how
much
blending
has
gone
on
in
this
beer
as
there
are
qualities
that
make
it
seem
more
fresh
than
not
otoh
not
all
of
it
seems
that
way
the
lingering
flavor
seems
unique
to
this
beer
i
think
i
like
it
creamy
smooth
feel
tart
crabapple
acidity
tannic
cherry
skins
even
level
of
carb
drying
finish
very
well
integrated
not
overly
sour
perfect
for
a
flanders
lover
overall
a
solid
beer
and
one
that
is
great
to
see
from
evolution
for
the
price
not
sure
i
would
do
again
overall
this
style
is
something
entirely
new
to
me
but
after
my
first
one
im
hungry
for
more
its
rauchbiers
all
over
again
its
does
really
well
for
the
style
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
category
with
a
little
more
carbonation
it
could
have
been
much
better
the
price
tag
is
still
a
little
outrageous
though
m
medium
bodied
because
of
low
carbonation
o
a
great
sour
from
evolution
and
very
well
balanced
i
really
hope
i
am
able
to
find
another
bottle

best
beer
i
have
had
from
evolution

45
im
new
to
flemish
sours
this
one
is
good
but
i
want
to
try
others
this
is
a
very
good
ale
particularly
for
the
price
i
see
a
case
of
it
in
my
future
the
sourness
is
superb
just
tart
enough
to
be
enjoyable
but
not
vinegary
the
fruitiness
of
the
blended
ales
comes
through
as
does
some
oakiness
from
the
aging
vats
but
the
vanillin
is
low
received
this
in
a
beer
of
the
month
club
i
will
freely
admit
i
am
completely
new
to
drinking
beer
of
this
style
the
beer
is
a
mixed
ale
75
young
with
25
aged
in
oak
barrels
the
smell
was
very
fruity
and
floral
almost
smelling
more
like
wine
than
beer
ive
tried
a
ton
of
stuff
from
american
craft
breweries
and
liked
many
of
them
but
i
can
honestly
say
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
one
from
belgium
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
tart
at
first
but
that
quickly
fades
to
more
complex
flavors
of
the
malt
and
hops
the
finish
is
clean
and
refreshing
really
blown
away
and
ready
for
more
true
belgian
style
beers
enjoyable
beer
even
though
it
is
neither
very
sour
not
very
sweet
and
definitely
not
bitter
drain
pour
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
maybe
a
bad
batch
or
something
but
i
hated
it
very
good
overall
o
a
ridiculously
good
sour
ale
complex
sour
delicious
drinkable
a
real
winner

most
in
the

and
more
so
than
most
other
rodenbachs
vinous
sharp

and
cherry
with
a

is
a
nice
mix
of
both
sweet
and

and
red

vinous
aspects
throughout
lighty

a

followed
by

with

medium

medium

drying
feel
in

quite
good
not
as
good
as
the
2010
vintage
but
better
than
the
grand
cru
o
this
is
just
a
stellar
beer
it
is
understandable
why
rodenbach
is
the
champion
of
the
style
amazing
stuff
from
rodenbach
rich
fruit
character
with
a
generous
acidiy
and
sourness
but
this
balanced
out
really
well
and
had
some
support
from
the
oak
to
play
really
well
together
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
i
bought
7
bottles
and
i
think
its
at
its
peak
now
if
this
beer
is
anything
like
the
2011
the
vinegar
will
quickly
dominate
the
cherrysherry
perhaps
this
beer
isnt
pasteurized
the
grand
cru
is
see
palms
website
and
continues
to
dry
out
still
its
sour
enjoy
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
im
glad
i
managed
to
pick
up
a
delicious
and
memorable
rodenbach
probably
gets
even
better
with
age
but
not
too
much
though
tricky
thing
is
to
find
the
sweet
spot
sour
cherry
mixed
with
mild
oak
just
fantastic
high
b
along
with
usual
rodenbachs
aromas
and
flavours
there
was
something
that
reminded
me
of
a
nail
polishing
liquid
and
similar
maybe
it
was
my
glass
incredible
sweet
and
sour
balance
with
a
unique
character
and
great
complexity
not
too
sour
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
funky
they
sure
produce
my
favorite
flanders

this
is
a
truly
masterpiece

and
refreshing

with
a

well
carbonated
light

and
dark
fruit
on

nose
plums
and
raisins
make
their
way
from
the
aromas
to
the
flavors
nice
and
tart
seems
a
lighter
version
of
the
grand
cru
and
appropriately
so
definitely
more
of
a
regular
treat
than
the
granddaddy

nice
balance
between
sweet
and

with
hints
of
cherries
and
red
wine
the
aroma
also
reveals
subtle
caramel
flavours
a
fine
example
of
an
underrated
beerstyle
refreshing
and
tangy
with
a
fluctuating
im
pretty
sure
but
well
hidden
abv
one
of
the
original
examples
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
dark
red
color
to
it
and
a
lively
tan
head
with
excellent
lace
and
retention
it
smells
puckery
but
more
on
the
vinegar
side
of
lacto
than
the
citric
side
which
is
fine
in
this
instance
because
its
balanced
by
sweeter
amber
malt
and
a
nice
buttery
nutty
front
end
that
only
eventually
and
reluctantly
gives
way
to
the
acidity
clean
and
bright
in
feel
though
shaking
its
weighty
start
and
finishing
really
quite
expressive
and
delicate
for
what
it
is
way
more
drinkable
than
the
grand
cru
with
notes
of
dried
fruit
and
molasses
still
in
this
one
but
its
so
much
more
approachable
especially
for
the
uninitiated
top
quality
stuff
but
everything
from
rodenbach
is
im
really
crazy
about
the
grand
cru
so
thought
to
give
the
red
classic
a
try
some
barnyardearthy
scents
also
a
touch
of
sulfur
scents
flavor
is
tart
yet
malty
kinda
simple
and
not
much
complexity
not
the
most
flavorful
of
the
flanders
red
style
but
still
an
ok
option
for
reasonable
price
not
really
interested
in
buying
again
bought
this
on
clearance
for
1
thinking
it
is
pretty
old
poured
dark
like
a
coke
aroma
is
slightly
boozy
with
some
apple
fruitiness
mild
flavor
it
has
a
sharp
bite
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
followed
by
some
apple
flavors
actually
taste
pretty
good
not
sure
what
it
would
taste
fresh
but
not
bad
old
almost
like
a
fruit
soda
pop
smell
like
sweet
malts
taste
like
esters
from
the
yeast
the
hop
presence
for
me
was
non
existent
there
is
a
slight
acidic
twang
very
enjoyable
and
very
different
from
what
i
expected
the
beer
is
complex
and
highly
drinkable
pours
a
very
dark
but
mostly
clear

new
style
for
me
wasnt
prepared
so
surprised
a
bit
have
to
taste
it
once
more
its
got
all
my
favorite
things
mildly
sour
yet
this
red
flemish
is
flavorful
without
being
very
hoppy
it
was
new
for
meruby
color
with
medium
white
head
aroma
of

taste
is
balanced
tart
winey
sweet
an
sour
pleasant
acidic
finish
very
clean
lightly
tart
and
acidic
winelike
solid
and
easy
drinking
for
the
style
o
not
too
impressed
since
i
expected
the
taste
to
jump
out
more
like
the
grand
cru
did
still
an
excellent
beer
and
worth
buying
if
you
can
get
it
in
the
little
singles
like
i
did
o
a
fairly
unique
beer
that
is
full
of
unique
flavor
a
bit
too
sour
and
sweet
for
me
but
very
different
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
is
a
drinking
flanders
one
of
those
you
would
always
have
a
bottle
on
hand
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
one
milder
but
shows
more
fruit
than
sour
acidity
while
i
will
say
i
prefer
the
grand
cru
this
is
still
quite
good
the
front
of
the
palate
impresses
but
that
quickly
goes
away
a
decent
step
behind
the
grand
cru
rodenbach
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
really
love
flanders
reds
but
ive
only
had
a
few
in
the
past
so
its
hard
for
me
to
evaluate
this
to
style
nonetheless
it
is
absolutely
delicious
its
tangy
wine
finish
carries
an
inherent
honey
balance
that
seems
of
confectioners
delight
yet
pierced
by
its
earthen
variety
for
an
effortless
close
with
lingering
vinous
lightly
powdered
astringency
and
surprisingly
refreshing
vinegar
dryness
oi
found
this
to
be
pretty
tasty
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
nothing
too
overwhelming
which
makes
his
beer
a
good
goto
when
your
having
a
sour
craving
appearance
is
nice
brownish
red
color
i
like
the
smell
a
lot
hard
to
describe
the
taste
is
excellent
this
is
my
first
sour
beer
buying
it
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
sour
beer
the
initial
taste
is
good
a
cider
lite
oak
taste
i
like
the
aftertaste
a
lot
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
o
fine
example
of
a
balanced
flanders
red
i
prefer
a
little
more
sourness
but
this
is
certainly
a
top
quality
version
of
the
style
and
one
id
definitely
recommend
to
others
especially
those
just
getting
into
sours
m
wellblended
and
smooth
a
good
flemish
redbrown
ale
it
pours
nicely
although
barely
any
head
smells
a
little
like
dark
cherries
medium
carbonation
fruity
but
not
as
much
as
a
lambic
refreshing
i
could
have
it
for
brunch
lunch
or
snack
not
something
to
taste
in
detail
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
a
good
way
to
be
broken
in
with
sours
o
still
getting
a
handle
on
the
stylebut
this
seems
to
be
a
solid
drinkable
offering
o
one
of
the
best
introductory
sours
out
there
sweet
and
sour
without
being
overbearing
very
refreshing
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
have
to
admit
i
really
liked
the
oakiness
that
was
present
it
really
made
a
difference
pretty
drinkable
will
try
the
grand
cru
at
some
point
oi
am
not
a
fan
of
the
sourness
but
it
really
was
a
good
beer
overall
i
may
have
one
again
overall
pretty
classic
flanders
red
it
has
been
some
time
since
i
have
had
this
beer
and
ill
make
sure
i
have
more
sooner
in
the
near
future
o
great
cherry
notes
with
just
enough
tartness
to
keep
you
wanting
more
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ive
had
of
the
style
as
well
getting
more
into
belgian
redbrown
ales
this
ones
smooth
balanced
and
flavorful
hints
of
vinegar
and
sour
fruit
on
the
aromas
cherry
cranberry
flavor
is
a
bit
tart
and
sweet
hints
of
herbal
spice
not
a
really
deeply
complex
character
but
some
good
tart
and
fruity
notes
as
stated
in
previous
reviews
this
would
make
for
an
ideal
introduction
to
sour
beers
sweet
and
tasty
without
being
overwhelmingly
sour
smooth
and
sessionable
o
this
is
the
first
sour
i
have
enjoyed
probably
as
others
have
said
because
this
is
a
gateway
sour
for
me
i
had
lips
of
faith
and
found
the
sourness
too
much
this
flanders
red
is
much
more
palatable
for
those
wanting
some
sour
but
not
seeking
a
sour
bomb
nicely
done
i
will
buy
again
pours
murky
brown
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
smell
has
sweet
grapes
cherries
some
wild
yeast
and
some
vinegar
although
the
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
the
nose
suggests
a
low
level
of
sourness
is
met
with
a
sweet
red
wine
taste
and
a
clean
effervescent
sparkling
water
finish
carbonation
is
high
and
the
body
is
light
overall
solid
good
beer
as
i
expected
it
would
be
doesnt
do
anything
particularly
special
its
simply
an
effective
and
consistent
beer
i
would
give
it
a
try
probably
not
a
repurchase
except
maybe
on
tap
i
prefer
beers
that
i
want
to
finish
now
to
be
fair
i
think
this
was
my
6th
beer
of
the
evening
so
not
sure
how
that
will
factor
into
my
opinion
picked
up
this
beer
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
because
i
love
the
grand
cru
good
looking
beer
with
an
excellent
smell
smells
clean
sweet
and
tasty
taste
is
great
not
as
sweet
as
grand
cru
but
very
good
and
clean
nothing
to
complain
about
this
beer
surprised
me
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
somehow
did
not
expect
it
to
be
this
good
not
a
great
value
but
i
would
revisit
if
i
could
find
it
as
a
decent
price
definitely
worth
trying
excellent
beer
and
one
i
plan
to
revisit
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
lacks
complexity
beautifully
complex
sour
yet
not
quite
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
a
nice
mix
of
fruits
that
add
some
sweetness
to
proceedings
a
great
beer
to
sip
away
at
postscript
after
writing
this
i
skimmed
a
few
of
the
reviews
below
the
guy
talking
about
sneaking
this
into
movie
theaters
is
all
kinds
of
awesome
cheers
mate
tasted
on
1182013
this
was
a
new
bottle
purchased
locally
poured
from
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
o
thought
this
was
tasty
a
touch
sour
but
balanced
well
on
the
finish
o
watery
sour
apple
not
unpleasant
per
se
but
not
particularly
laudable
o
a
solid
beer
drinkable
and
pleasant
but
the
grand
cru
puts
it
to
shame
i
was
surprised
to
find
myself
not
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
wanted
im
relatively
familiar
with
rodenbachs
vintage
releases
so
i
felt
this
would
be
simple
and
refreshing
in
its
own
realm
nevertheless
its
a
little
too
underwhelming
overall
for
what
it
is
and
lacks
complexity
and
unique
flavors
that
i
love
in
the
style
as
well
as
in
rodenbachs
capabilities
not
bad
for
a
toned
down
flanders
red
but
not
something
given
the
price
tag
10
that
id
revisit
any
time
soon
well
priced
and
something
i
could
session
a
nice
beginner
flanders
and
i
can
see
this
making
a
great
gateway
brew
a
lovely
balanced
flanders
red
ale
sour
yes
but
sweet
fruity
and
nicely
tempered
by
the
musty
woody
factor
enjoyably
quenching
not
something
i
thought
id
reason
about
a
sour
ale
but
there
it
is
a
very
approachable
if
not
most
affordable
flanders
red
ale
i
could
see
this
impressing
everyone
from
the
most
sophisticated
of
palate
to
a
guy
like
me
looking
for
an
affordable
sour
beer
on
occasion
try
it
overall
not
too
bad
but
i
was
expecting
better
the
aroma
was
very
good
although
it
lost
the
zing
that
the
initial
pour
provided
very
quickly
the
initial
and
finish
of
the
taste
was
very
nice
but
let
down
by
the
flabby
and
bland
middle
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
have
another
without
hesitation
quite
and
easydrinking
sour
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
in
approachability
o
this
beer
held
up
a
lot
better
then
i
thought
it
would
for
being
a
30
year
old
bottle
the
aroma
when
i
first
cracked
the
bottle
was
actually
one
of
the
best
aromas
ive
experienced
in
a
beer
with
the
perfect
balance
of
tart
cherries
vinegar
and
malts
its
a
shame
it
couldnt
have
lasted
a
little
bit
longer
overall
the
bottle
definitely
showed
its
age
put
was
without
a
doubt
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
nice
sour
beer
fairly
complex
easily
drinkable
theres
enough
sweetness
and
malt
character
to
not
allow
the
sourness
to
overwhelm
lowish
b
overall
a
good
flemish
red
that
is
very
cheap
and
available
like
this
one
a
lot
go
belgium
go
belgium
m
solid
body
with
nice
carbonation
that
carries
the
sweetness
and
tartness
across
the
palate
my
first
sour
beer
i
am
definitely
open
to
further
exploration
o
wonderful
sour
at
a
great
price
great
everyday
sour
as
its
affordable
and
easy
to
obtain
no
seasonal
or
limited
run
status
here
14
oak
aged
34
young
beer
if
you
enjoy
sour
beers
vinegar
pickles
or
anything
tart
give
this
one
a
shot
a
very
well
balanced
sour
ale
good
flavor
but
not
to
overwhelming
a
great
sour
to
introduce
yourself
to
the
style
but
one
to
come
back
to
for
fans
of
sours
as
well
pours
out
a
nice
dark
redamber
color
with
a
slightly
hazy
body
and
filled
with
carbonation
the
head
is
thin
and
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
forms
a
nice
thin
ring
of
lace
there
are
plenty
a
fruit
aromas
coming
through
apple
grape
lemon
and
figs
too
but
i
also
pick
up
a
very
faint
vinegar
scent
its
sour
and
sweetens
up
as
it
hits
the
corners
of
your
mouth
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
the
woody
flavors
do
come
out
as
you
swallow
but
the
very
faintly
and
the
sourness
does
linger
it
goes
down
quit
smooth
o
very
delicious
for
the
age
and
low
abv
it
strikes
a
great
balance
between
very
mild
taste
that
is
still
very
complex
i
will
certainly
add
more
of
these
to
my
cellar
it
is
a
great
beer
to
just
enjoy
and
not
be
overpowered
with
in
your
face
sour
overall
this
is
a
really
special
beer
its
got
everything
a
great
sour
belgian
beer
should
have
and
to
boot
its
not
that
alcoholic
or
hard
to
drink
like
some
belgian
beers
can
be
i
will
diffidently
be
picking
this
up
again
for
sure
o
easy
drinker
overall
not
what
i
would
go
for
if
i
was
craving
a
sour
ale
but
it
has
a
nice
tartness
and
smoothness
common
to
the
style
makes
for
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
time
bottle
at
stubbies
in
gaineville
poured
in
rodenbach
tulip
not
what
i
was
expecting
after
having
their
vintage
2010
really
more
of
a
quad
dubbel
or
belgian
dark
pours
dark
brownish
res
with
a
thin
fluffy
head
on
top
aroma
of
plums
and
cherry
with
verry
littke
sourness
flavor
follows
with
some
additional
strong
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
of
molasses
black
cherry
and
a
hint
of
funk
a
very
good
and
flavorful
beer
but
not
on
style
here
medium
to
heavy
slick
mouthfeel
soft
and
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
with
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
overall
quite
good
but
the
grand
cru
is
much
better
o
very
drinkable
sour
though
not
my
favorite
however
it
may
be
good
for
those
who
dont
like
an
overly
sour
beer
o
tasty
but
doesnt
rise
above
the
crowd
of
sours
still
its
a
good
one
to
grab
off
the
shelf
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
has
all
of
the
hallmarks
of
what
i
expect
a
flanders
red
ale
to
be
its
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
while
being
a
bit
tart
i
prefer
the
grand
cru
to
this
but
this
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
based
on
the
way
this
is
made
25
2
years
matured
and
75
young
i
think
it
is
ready
to
drink
immediately
this
is
a
good
example
of
beerfood
as
culture
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
a
sixpack
bought
at
litickers
liquor
deli
in
san
diego
for
a
quite
reasonable
price
interesting
to
discover
this
brewery
is
now
owned
by
palm
of
belgium
which
makes
some
hack
beers
of
no
distinction
at
all
overall
a
nicely
tart
very
cherry
forward
easier
drinking
flemish
red
nothing
like
the
super
complex
and
sour
ones
with
more
old
beer
in
the
blend
the
young
beer
gives
it
a
nice
a
malty
base
while
the
small
percentage
of
old
beer
in
there
provides
just
enough
funk
and
sourness
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
only
a
small
fleeting
bubbly
head
deep
acidic
aromas
of
vinegar
black
cherry
berries
red
wine
and
wood
alongside
a
nice
rich
creaminess
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
tart
fruity
flavor
with
some
oak
and
a
balancing
malt
sweetness
medium
bodied
acidic
and
crisp
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
good
beer
but
the
hype
it
definitely
does
not
live
up
to
honestly
this
is
probably
my
first
flanders
red
ale
and
i
want
to
try
more
before
i
put
them
on
the
beware
list
salud
interesting
style
i
may
have
to
hunt
down
a
few
other
examples
of
this
pour
is
much
darker
than
anticipated
deep
ruby
brown
with
slight
white
lacing
smell
is
so
complex
lots
of
sweet
toffee
english
malts
and
oak
but
a
huge
cherry
tartness
is
dominant
taste
is
nicely
tart
cherry
but
so
balanced
with
the
sweet
toffee
malt
and
oak
its
super
dry
as
expected
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
great
is
example
of
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
from
what
i
can
tell
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
so
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
at
all
but
it
seems
to
be
close
to
the
description
ba
provides
for
the
style
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
the
flavors
kept
me
interested
but
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
would
prevent
from
having
another
one
of
these
small
bottles
is
the
perfect
amount
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
nice
with
lots
of
tart
fruit
aromas
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
a
little
more
head
and
lacing
would
make
this
beer
look
pretty
good
i
would
buy
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
and
tart
beer
its
not
too
expensive
especially
for
a
beer
from
belgium
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
want
something
with
a
little
bit
of
tartness
to
it
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
had
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
to
it
and
the
cherry
aspect
was
pretty
nice
this
beer
made
for
a
good
first
impression
for
this
brewery
and
it
has
made
me
want
to
try
more
of
the
style
good
job
guys
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
unique
brew
a
local
package
store
has
rodenbach
in
6packs
and
i
want
to
go
buy
it
now
o
if
you
are
in
to
belgian
sours
you
will
like
this
beer
sweet
and
sour
elements
are
well
balanced
o
one
thing
that
deserves
to
be
mentioned
is
how
inexpensive
this
bottle
was
about
1
75
for
a
single
11
2
oz
bottle
its
not
the
greatest
sour
ever
but
as
a
refreshing
thirst
quencher
id
take
this
over
many
standard
fruit
beers
any
day
its
cheap
for
a
sour
its
well
made
and
its
a
panty
dropper
enough
said
o
wow
i
was
very
skeptical
about
trying
sours
but
this
thing
was
just
unbelievable
this
was
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
and
i
am
excited
for
future
sours
if
theyre
anything
like
this
medium
weight
and
medium
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
this
is
enjoyable
overall
has
a
nice
nose
and
the
sour
adds
a
good
profile
to
the
flavor
good
amazing
flanders
red
ale
just
behind
its
older
sister
the
grand
cru
a
beer
that
keeps
growing
through
the
tasting
session
simply
excellent
o
a
solid
beer
a
lot
of
feel
for
the
size
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
an
impressive
brew
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
idiosyncratic
styles
to
come
out
of
belgium
it
fascinates
me
how
allowing
a
beer
to
become
innoculated
by
a
range
of
microorganisms
and
then
aging
it
in
wood
produces
such
a
complexity
of
character
the
smell
is
just
as
you
might
expect
though
the
flavour
seems
thinner
and
less
intricate
than
the
aroma
the
body
is
also
somewhat
watery
and
insubstantial
good
but
falls
short
of
greatness
i
suspect
that
the
lack
of
bottle
conditioning
might
have
contributed
to
this
nonetheless
a
classic
beer
that
is
well
worth
trying
grab
one
if
you
have
the
chance
o
i
was
a
little
worried
in
the
beginning
but
where
this
beer
lacks
in
first
impressions
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
the
end
not
all
that
complex
but
it
is
a
solid
brew
none
the
less
complex
malts
somehow
its
sugary
without
being
sweet
subtle
tartness
with
more
funk
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
solid
flanders
that
focuses
on
malt
and
fruit
more
the
tartnesssourness
overall
very
good
flemish
red
not
too
sour
and
not
too
sweet
very
refreshing
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
o
complex
yet
refreshing
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
thought
it
had
turned
bad
now
its
a
beer
that
i
return
to
over
and
over
overall
the
sweetness
and
tart
flavor
will
for
sure
surprise
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
this
style
like
myself
or
turn
them
off
completely
all
of
that
aside
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
throughly
enjoyed
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
out
more
from
rodenbach
in
the
future
very
drinkable
i
wish
this
had
a
bit
more
funk
as
its
a
tad
papery
for
me
still
good
stuff
though
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
one
finger
creamy
off
white
head
the
nose
features
light
sweet
cherry
with
light
vinegar
the
flavors
are
both
sweet
and
tart
it
features
a
touch
of
sweet
cherry
with
an
acetic
tartness
but
also
has
this
odd
lager
yeast
and
pale
malt
characteristic
that
is
both
stale
and
really
strange
its
too
light
and
that
lager
aspect
is
really
distracting
it
drinks
light
with
a
decent
amount
of
residual
sugar
but
the
flavors
dont
all
come
together
very
well
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
it
is
well
below
duchesse
let
alone
their
grand
cru
jury
out
on
this
one
for
me
overall
o
very
refreshing
and
sweet
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
beer
is
mediumbodied
throughout
with
a
moderate
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
subtle
foaming
on
the
palate
the
result
is
a
slightly
creamy
yet
crisp
and
satisfying
beer
finish
is
very
dry
as
expected
with
little
stickiness
on
palate
half
finger
head
on
a
murky
brown
with
golden
hued
body
no
lacing
really
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
syrup
caramel
and
sour
cherry
flavor
is
similar
creamy
with
sour
cherry
caramel
and
syrups
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
nice
flavor
interesting
brew
not
sure
if
i
have
had
any
from
this
style
before
complex
and
more
drinkable
than
you
would
expect
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
very
drinkable
that
is
light
and
refreshing
it
would
be
a
very
mild
and
approachable
offering
for
someone
who
might
have
had
anything
similar
to
this
style
before
a
classic
i
couldnt
help
but
think
anout
the
endless
array
of
foods
this
could
be
paired
with
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
stay
fiscal
my
friends
this
was
good
packing
in
some
good
cherry
flavor
but
then
also
having
a
nice
acidic
bite
to
it
the
body
on
this
really
did
a
solid
job
of
keeping
those
flavors
accessible
as
well
this
is
well
worth
picking
up
its
very
drinkable
for
whats
involved
nice
carbonation
level
and
again
a
very
drinkable
flanders
red
overall
this
is
a
good
flanders
red
a
benchmark
for
the
style
in
a
lot
of
ways
its
crazydrinkable
but
dont
expect
a
depth
of
flavor
or
a
significant
sourness
this
may
be
my
first
flanders
red
ale
and
it
is
a
beauty
light
almost
airy
in
feel
with
a
pleasantly
tart
flavor
this
is
supremely
drinkable
despite
having
such
a
light
feel
the
flavor
is
not
lacking
in
the
least
letting
it
linger
on
the
tongue
amplifies
the
tartness
to
a
point
of
overstimulation
this
ale
lets
you
know
that
despite
a
delicate
appearance
it
will
pack
a
punch
if
you
let
it
i
definitely
recommend
especially
as
a
starter
beer
for
the
evening
or
as
a
dessert
beer
after
a
meal
overall
really
solid
beer
this
one
is
all
about
robust
and
balanced
flavors
very
nice
beer
plenty
of
flavors
to
keep
you
busy
very
well
balance
and
incredibly
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
having
this
one
more
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
it
is
very
well
balanced
but
i
would
appreciate
a
bit
more
sour
i
think
a
bit
of
time
612
months
in
the
cellar
could
improve
this
one
and
take
it
to
the
next
level
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
and
the
subtleties
really
come
through
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
recommended
to
any
fan
of
belgian
sours
or
any
funky
beer
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
different
and
enjoyable
beer
my
first
flanders
red
and
im
very
impressed
with
the
depth
of
aroma
and
flavors
they
get
in
a
relatively
small
5
2
abv
beer
well
done
o
i
think
the
ageing
had
something
to
do
with
it
i
had
an
older
bottle
of
duchesse
last
week
and
lost
almost
all
the
malt
and
was
more
of
a
cider
the
malt
stayed
quite
nicely
in
this
aged
brew
overall
on
paper
this
is
a
good
but
not
groundbreaking
beer
but
i
feel
like
there
are
good
intangibles
here
this
beer
is
a
tad
sweet
perhaps
but
overall
i
like
it
very
much
o
age
got
the
best
of
this
with
regards
to
taste
but
the
smell
is
still
holding
up
quite
well
either
way
it
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
and
the
oldest
ive
enjoyed
todate
od
not
bad
lacks
depth
of
better
examples
of
the
style
but
otherwise
a
good
intro
to
the
style
a
well
balanced
sour
250ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
dark
mahogany
colour
a
bit
like
red
wine
with
a
brown
tint
small
tanned
head
which
disappeared
fast
clear
from
the
top
but
thick
from
the
side
smelled
malts
and
red
wine
tasted
grape
was
like
a
light
sour
red
wine
notes
of
oak
yeasty
sour
finish
mouthfull
smooth
with
deceptive
carbonation
overall
id
say
the
more
i
get
used
to
the
sourness
the
better
i
like
it
o
i
love
this
beer
it
is
the
perfect
introduction
to
sours
but
not
a
true
sour
i
drink
it
like
a
world
class
session
beer
extremely
complex
and
refreshing
poured
into
tulip
glass
appears
a
deep
maroon
with
mild
clarity
tan
head
persists
nicely
with
spotty
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
heavy
with
notes
of
red
grapes
a
touch
of
vinegar
and
oak
is
present
as
well
along
with
some
sweetness
in
the
back
the
taste
has
a
mild
tartness
which
mingles
with
a
considerable
amount
of
fruity
sweetness
tons
of
grape
character
all
over
finish
falls
a
little
flat
with
almost
a
watery
character
the
mouth
feel
is
less
carbonated
than
i
would
hope
for
this
style
the
body
is
light
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
and
affordable
flanders
red
it
is
very
approachable
for
those
interested
in
the
world
of
sours
but
not
ready
for
overly
mouth
puckering
brews
my
first
belgian
love
a
beer
ive
been
drinking
since
i
turned
legal
a
great
flanders
red
4
5
o
a
very
drinkable
and
accessible
sour
obviously
not
as
sour
as
the
grand
cruthough
the
aroma
hinted
like
it
might
bebut
still
a
nice
balanced
example
of
the
style
d
liked
it
but
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
again
pours

very
murk

lots
of
tart
sweetness
on
the
nose
some
citrus
raisins
lemon
rind
green
apples
mildy
tart
not
over
the
top
tasting
low
amount
of
effervescence
malty
sweetness
up
front
almost
buttery
slides
around
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
bright
fruit
sourness
kicks
in
to
balance
a
wave
of
subtlety
for
a
sour
anyway
hidden
notes
of
oak
lots
of
deep
complex
flavors
if
you
wanna
look
for
them
pretty
smooth
and
well
balanced
i
usually
dont
like
sours
but
the
sour
flavors
lend
a
nice
balance
to
this
one
i
love
the
aroma
of
sour
cherries
and
malt
sweetness
you
can
taste
the
base
brown
ale
and
almost
seperate
it
form
the
sourness
after
trying
numerous
other
sour
beers
i
can
always
come
back
to
this
one
great
for
a
refreshing
experience
in
hot
weather
or
for
something
special
over
dinner
deep
reddish
brown
not
quite
opaque
no
head
didnt
really
expect
one
on
a
beer
like
this
one
really
nice
fruity
aroma
but
kind
of
one
dimensional
not
picking
up
any
funk
or
wood
maybe
just
a
touch
of
yeast
exceptionally
delicious
beer
and
while
i
appreciate
subtlety
in
a
brew
with
sour
character
they
dont
all
need
to
be
special
occasion
bottles
that
demand
constant
attention
and
reflection
this
is
an
outstanding
go
to
justfeltlikeasour
beer
what
im
trying
to
say
is
that
no
this
isnt
a
hall
of
fame
belgian
sour
but
yes
it
tastes
absolutely
incredible
and
is
an
outstanding
value
what
it
lacks
in
a
depth
comparison
to
the
grand
cru
it
makes
up
for
in
casualness
anyway
great
medium
body
on
this
beer
very
pleasant
carbonation
all
in
all
like
i
was
saying
a
totally
worthwhile
beer
but
if
you
came
for
the
funk
you
might
leave
disappointed
if
you
wanted
the
sweettart
beer
combo
in
a
sessionable
beer
at
a
legit
price
this
is
your
huckleberry
o
an
easy
drinking
flemish
sour
not
as
sophisticated
as
the
gran
cru
but
a
nicely
balanced
and
surprisingly
complex
beer
the
flavor
brings
a
beautiful
combo
of
cherry
and
oak
with
accompanying
acidity
body
is
nice
and
creamy
with
some
perceived
fruit
sweetness
dry
finish
after
a
somewhatchewy
body
really
a
great
example
of
the
style
light
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
almost
watery
this
is
not
as
good
as
the
grand
cru
in
fact
it
isnt
even
close
thats
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
grand
cru
onot
as
powerful
as
grand
cru
this
is
only
the
second
of
the
style
i
have
had
but
this
is
pretty
good
overall
good
beer
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
a
fantastic
beer
sour
yet
balanced
and
very
finely
crafted
im
very
happy
that
i
picked
up
a
bottle

draft

michael
jackson
called
this
refreshingi
guess
for
the
first
time
i
understand
what
he
meant
delicious
o
meh
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
definitely
better
flanders
reds
out
there
in
my
opinion
has
a
rusty
red
color
red
almost
comes
through
in
head
in
a
pinkish
khaki
color
head
holds
well
and
clings
to
glass
beer
is
clearly
filtered
zero
sediment
which
really
negates
beneficial
cellaring
smells
good
and
well
matured
though
musky
maltiness
along
with
sharp
yeast
notes
wide
range
of
mouthfeel
and
flavors
from
yeast
and
bacteria
varieties
bitterness
is
present
and
suiting
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
oak
isnt
too
much
and
really
compliments
the
flavor
profile
aftertaste
is
pleasant
solid
tartsour
character
i
find
this
to
be
an
approachable
beer
for
anybody
even
though
it
has
a
true
sour
beer
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brownish
red
color
there
is
about
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
decent
retention
and
there
is
some
whisky
lace
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
sour
fruit
up
fruit
mostly
cherries
raspberries
and
some
apple
there
are
some
aromas
of
vinegar
and
oak
i
am
also
getting
just
a
little
bit
of
funkiness
coming
through
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
it
starts
off
with
mostly
sour
cherries
but
the
raspberries
and
apple
flavors
are
their
as
well
there
is
some
vinegar
and
acidicness
there
is
some
oak
as
well
as
some
earthiness
and
yeasty
esters
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
sour
cherries
behind
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
it
goes
down
nicely
and
has
a
good
amount
of
sourness
to
it
it
has
some
earthy
bitterness
to
it
as
well
as
some
acidicness
this
has
good
drinkability
the
taste
is
quite
nice
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
this
is
my
first
flanders
red
but
i
definitely
look
forward
to
getting
my
hands
on
some
more
i
recommend
checking
this
one
out
this
is
to
sours
what
sierra
nevada
is
to
pale
ales
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
not
too
sour
but
lots
of
flavor
with
a
full
body
this
isnt
the
most
complex
sour
but
its
a
great
intro
and
eventually
stand
by
with
such
a
low
abv
i
like
finishing
my
night
with
a
rodenbach
go
home
with
the
one
that
brung
ya
perhaps
i
shouldnt
have
drank
it
right
out
of
the
fridge
i
think
letting
it
sit
would
have
opened
it
up
a
lot
o
this
beer
definitely
has
some
winelike
qualities
the
low
abv
makes
it
easy
to
polish
off
in
a
sitting
o
a
very
rich
and
flavorful
beer
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
the
flavors
seem
much
more
integrated
than
many
other
examples
of
this
style
probably
due
to
the
strong
blending
experience
at
the
brewery
o
the
tame
and
subtle
flavors
combined
with
the
crazy
smooth
body
make
this
a
really
fantastic
beer
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
a
bit
of
letdown
but
the
other
qualities
balance
those
out
i
doubt
aging
has
improved
this
beer
but
it
sure
as
hell
can
hold
up
to
a
few
years
of
cellaring
overall
a
very
nice
beer
tastes
a
little
like
an
aged
wine
with
the
initial
watery
feeling
but
fantastic
over
all
good
version
of
this
style
and
a
bit
more
accessible
than
their
vintage
version
of
this
have
not
yet
had
the
chance
to
try
the
grand
cru
taste
is
enjoyable
mostly
tart
cherries
with
a
subtle
sour
characteristic
that
would
pair
well
with
food
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
bodied
and
the
carbonation
was
high
but
appropriate
an
excellent
brew
o
a
solid
flemish
red
doesnt
have
as
much
going
on
as
the
grand
cru
but
still
an
great
beer
would
probably
be
a
good
intro
to
sour
beers
before
moving
onto
some
more
aggressive
lambics
do
very
very
drinkable
i
admit
i
liked
this
more
the
first
time
i
had
it
now
that
i
realize
its
not
sour
at
all
i
find
myself
wishing
it
were
a
great
beer
to
start
on
if
youre
not
used
to
the
style
honestly
compares
slightly
more
to
an
oud
bruin
in
my
opinion
having
it
after
a
monks
cafe
than
a
flanders
red
mostly
because
of
its
lack
of
sourness
the
two
are
very
very
similar
i
absolutely
love
both
styles
though
so
still
a
great
beer
to
drink
poured
a
34
beige
head
which
dissipated
pretty
quickly
deep
burnt
umber
brown
color
almost
like
coffee
smell
is
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
a
lot
of
pickle
juice
taste
is
the
reverse
the
pickle
sour
is
more
subdued
and
it
has
some
fruitiness
such
as
cherry
its
probably
the
mildest
sour
ive
had
o
very
muted
and
dark
compared
to
grand
cru
not
that
impressed
poured
from
a

2
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brownishred
color
with
a
12
inch

smell
is
alive
with
fruits
taste
is
tart
cherries
some
other
berries
lots
of
flavor
here
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
very
good
beer
worth
checking
out
good
carbonation
somewhat
dry
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
falls
shy
of
the
much
more
complex
grand
cru
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
affordable
sour
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
them
i
remember
this
being
one
of
my
first
and
me
raving
about
it
to
everyone
now
that
im
a
bit
more
experienced
in
the
sour
field
i
decided
to
try
it
again
and
it
tastes
completely
different
overall
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
notsosour
kind
of
flanders
beers
out
there
some
of
them
end
up
tasting
like
juice
this
one
does
not
at
all
i
also
like
that
it
comes
in
sixpacks
overall
i
am
surprised
that
i
am
saying
this
but
i
would
like
this
to
be
a
little
more
tart
this
a
great
beer
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
style
45
o
overall
a
pretty
good
readily
available
flanders
not
too
sour
so
could
be
good
for
someone
looking
to
just
get
into
sours
would
have
it
again
good
fruit
sweetness
with
some
drying
and
a
solid
puckering
tartness
a
good
flanders
red
but
i
prefer
the
grand
cru
due
to
the
complexities
that
further
oak
aging
brings
out
but
definitely
not
a
bad
beer

ogreat
beer
one
of
my
favorite
styles
dhighly
drinkable
drinks
more
like
a
mildly
carbonated
yet
complex
juice
cocktail
wow
i
cant
believe
how
fast
i
am
imbibing
this
as
one
of
my
first
sour
beers
not
the
first
i
can
tell
i
am
falling
in
love
with
these
styles
awesome
beer
75
young
ale
25
ale
matured
for
2
years
in
oak
vats
another
excellent
though
not
world
changing
beer
from
rodenbach
overall
this
is
really
good
and
surprisingly
drinkable
would
i
get
this
again
yes
o
this
is
about
as
sessionable
as
sour
beers
come
not
huge
with
flavors
but
really
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
malts
and
sour
flavors
its
extremely
refreshing
overall
nice
entrylevel
flanders
red
beers
in
this
style
really
fall
somewhere
on
a
spectrum
of
of
sweet
to
sour
and
the
blending
percentages
of
this
one
definitely
push
it
towards
sweet
tasty
stuff
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
grand
cru
overall
a
really
nice
flemish
sour
i
was
glad
to
try
nothing
is
overly
complex
or
sour
but
everything
is
pleasant
enjoyable
and
well
done
for
the
most
part
i
would
get
this
again
im
new
to
flanders
red
ales
and
this
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
prefer
but
a
very
good
overall
definately
worth
trying
and
a
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
must
have
and
seems
readily
available
as
well
pours
a
dark
browncrimson
into
my
snifter
w
an
amazing
two
finger
cocoa
head
incredible
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
good
carbonation
as
well
really
a
looker
nose
is
apple
grape
oak
funk
maybe
some
prunes
as
well
very
smooth
for
the
style
and
not
overpowering
taste
has
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
with
the
grape
really
coming
out
in
the
aftertaste
very
easy
nice
drinker
almost
like
drinking
wine
feel
is
smooth
but
funky
w
high
acidity
as
well
really
nice
overall
this
is
a
great
flanders
and
ill
pick
this
up
again
for
sure
o
very
pleasurable
and
easy
drinking
yet
an
excellent
sipper
with
cork
topped
bottle
and
ample
carbonation
this
is
a
great
choice
as
a
beer
for
celebrations
or
italian
foods
in
reflection
i
wish
for
a
little
more
complexity
but
ive
been
spoiled
thanks
to
the
goodness
that
comes
out
of
russian
river
bottle
from
half
time
pours
are
dark
amber
color
small
off
white
head
with
fair
retention
reducing
to
a
light
lacing
cap
scent
is
tart
with
cherry
and
plum
taste
is
a
surge
of
sour
and
sweet
dancing
on
the
tounge
sweet
prevails
over
the
mighty
sour
army
dark
fruits
say
hello
mouth
is
light
to
medium
with
nice
belgiany
mouth
alchohol
is
hidden
more
please
light
and
fullflavored
without
becoming
too
puckering
nicely
balanced
very
tasty
and
refreshing
i
have
tried
the
grand
cru
before
but
will
have
to
bring
a
bottle
home
and
try
it
in
a
more
controlled
environment
o
i
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
personally
i
dont
like
wine
but
this
combination
is
interesting
i
could
see
myself
getting
into
the
style
once
the
beer
sits
for
a
bit
this
feels
more
like
that
oa
pretty
good
tasting
and
easy
drinking
belgian
sour
its
not
a
world
class
beer
but
there
also
isnt
anything
keeping
me
from
being
able
to
enjoy
this
at
any
time
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
find
that
i
love
it
the
subtleties
of
the
flavors
really
start
to
pop
out
this
isnt
the
first
time
with
a
flanders
so
i
was
kinda
hoping
it
would
have
that
cost
efficient
sour
taste
im
looking
for
it
wasnt
to
far
off
this
poured
a
solid
murky
dark
red
brown
with
little
head
if
there
was
one
its
just
a
ring
of
little
bubbles
now
the
nose
on
this
came
off
with
some
vinegar
but
not
overpowering
and
then
led
into
a
solid
sour
fruit
wave
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
except
not
as
strong
and
the
flavors
had
a
slight
apple
juice
taste
to
it
and
definitely
has
a
cherry
ending
not
overly
fruity
but
its
all
you
taste
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
good
though
lots
of
jumpy
carbonation
in
it
and
a
very
nice
dry
finish
overall
its
a
decent
beer
if
it
had
more
sour
fruit
and
a
little
less
vinegar
i
think
i
would
score
it
hire
really
delicious
and
a
great
beer
loved
it
as
a
relative
noob
to
sours
and
a
total
noob
to
this
style
i
can
still
see
how
this
is
considered
a
classic
does
everything
i
expected
it
to
do
and
does
it
well
i
cant
really
say
if
styles
such
as
this
are
my
cup
of
tea
as
im
just
in
the
experimental
stage
right
now
but
i
get
the
appeal
o
ive
only
had
a
a
handful
of
flanders
reds
so
my
points
of
comparison
are
somewhat
limited
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
would
be
a
nice
introductory
sour
for
a
wine
lover
for
sure
this
is
a
great
beer
which
is
truly
a
great
example
of
a
regional
belgian
style
if
you
want
to
really
branch
out
and
try
something
very
different
than
this
is
a
great
beer
to
reach
out
and
try
great
maroon
color
with
a
nice
white
head
lacing
smells
of
nice
cherries
grapes
and
i
hate
to
say
it
sourpatch
kids
the
first
sip
gives
a
nice
tart
cherries
with
some
real
nice
sour
funk
this
is
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
and
is
one
that
i
feel
is
a
must
try
for
everyone
and
is
definitely
one
i
will
go
back
to
when
i
am
in
the
modd
for
something
sour
but
which
is
still
very
drinkable
overall
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
presentation
the
appearance
and
nose
built
up
my
anticipation
but
the
taste
while
not
bad
was
muted
and
very
plain
ill
have
to
try
the
grand
cru
overall
experienceeasy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
seems
to
sit
in
my
stomach
though
probably
not
advised
as
a
session
beer
a
great
sipping
beer
even
though
it
is
not
a
high
gravity
beer
a
staple
as
a
flanders
red
in
my
opinion
absolutely
delicious
im
not
a
flanders
red
ale
expert
but
i
do
know
that
i
highly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
to
applaud
the
balance
here
its
not
too
sour
not
too
fruity
its
just
good
rodenbach
classic
poured
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
little
fizzy
head
there
was
a
sweet
berry
like
smell
the
taste
was
dry
fizzy
had
a
nice
tartness
and
hints
of
different
berries
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
red
wine
very
easy
and
nice
to
drink
good
strong
flavor
carbonation
worked
out
very
well
for
this
one
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
out
of
the
norm
but
very
impressive
and
enjoyable
oi
prefer
the
grand
cru
this
is
a
great
comparison
point
in
terms
of
understanding
how
much
of
a
difference
the
blend
makes
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
however
carbonation
keeps
it
lively
enough
no
alcohol
what
so
ever
not
a
style
i
have
much
so
i
guess
this
is
pretty
good
nice
on
a
hot
night
the
color
is
dark
red
and
medium
brown
in
the
glass
little
aroma
but
plenty
of
sour
sweet
lightly
malty
taste
no
hops
bitter
to
speak
ofthats
not
the
style
this
is
brown
malt
and
fruity
sour
sweet
fruit
on
top
and
a
touch
of
earthiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
and
rather
light
with
some
prickly
carbonation
and
bright
acidity
this
isnt
the
most
sour
sour
beer
it
isnt
the
fruitiest
fruity
beer
it
isnt
the
maltiest
brown
beer
but
it
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
sour
fruity
redbrown
beer
750
ml
bottle
into
oversized
wine
glass
best
by

pours
crystal
clear
red
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
lacing
cap
that
lasts
small
bits
of
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
cherry
vinegar
oak
and
some
spiciness
decent
aromas
here
a
tad
bit
more
muted
than
i
was
expecting
taste
of
big
cherry
oak
vinegar
and
apples
nice
sweet
taste
with
a
slight
bit
of
apple
and
cherry
tartness
on
the
finish
the
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
with
only
some
light
sweetness
and
tartness
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
very
smooth
drinking
with
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
or
finish
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
and
easy
going
beer
due
to
the
light
amount
of
sourness
present
in
this
overall
a
very
nice
flanders
red
i
would
like
to
try
a
younger
bottle
of
this
sometime
tastes
delicious
freshly
picked
wild
berries
with
some
acidic
sourness
reminiscent
of
granny
smith
apples
and
its
also
tartly
crisp
malts
are
light
in
the
mouth
but
still
offer
a
nice
background
its
an
approachable
sour
beer
as
the
sourness
is
not
overly
intense
i
would
not
mind
if
it
was
a
bit
sourer
but
that
would
take
away
from
the
extreme
drinkability
of
this
beer
it
goes
down
so
damn
easy
i
could
drink
a
750
by
myself
with
ease
excellent
brew
pours
a
murky
brownish
red
with
tan
head
that
fades
yet
reappears
with
some
swirling
of
the
glass
smells
of
balsamic
vinegar
with
some
brown
sugar
notes
maybe
a
little
fig
or
slight
raisin
notes
tastes
sour
yet
has
a
sweet
brown
sugar
like
quality
i
also
get
flashes
of
cocoa
and
maybe
some
vanilla
notes
likely
from
the
barrel
aging
a
fine
beer
a
great
beginner
sour
for
those
just
getting
in
to
em
this
one
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
wiith
bitter
and
lighter
sour
notes
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
o
a
great
beer
very
nice
flavor
profile
with
a
perfect
level
of
tartness
would
have
certainly
ordered
another
if
not
for
the
price
something
i
will
probably
grab
some
bottles
of
overall
excellent
brew
i
prefer
the
grand
cru
though
rodenbach
is
tasty
in
many
ways
it
is
tart
which
makes
it
almost
refreshing
based
on
the
relatively
low
abv5
2
and
the
slight
yeasty
smoothness
in
the
flavor
combined
with
vanilla
oakiness
which
is
fantastic
alongside
the
subtle
cherry
tastes
in
the
malt
and
yeast
combination
the
fruit
elements
are
so
dominant
which
says
a
lot
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
contain
fruit
this
was
probably
too
much
for
the
meal
i
paired
it
with
succotash
and
scallops
with
a
chili
rub
but
i
enjoyed
how
the
fruit
sour
elements
combined
with
my
wifec
coconut
curry
basmati
rice
and
firecracker
shrimp
i
could
enjoy
this
red
about
any
time
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
high
level
of
drinkability
and
flavor
quotient
of
the
grand
cru
but
hey
for
what
it
is
rodenbach
is
a
decent
all
around
beer
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
but
from
what
im
getting
from
this
i
certainly
will
seek
out
more
in
the
future
really
enjoyed
this
dark
purplish
red
clear
body
several
small
trails
of
rising
carbonation
minimal
head
with
quick
dissipation
resulted
in
thin
broken
layer
on
top
of
body
nose
is
pretty
funky
musty
horseblanket
balanced
by
fruit
esters
cherry
plums
lemon
minimal
hop
presence
a
bit
flowery
taste
is
more
sour
than
tart
though
in
nice
balance
rich
oakiness
from
the
tuns
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
lip
smacking
tart
dry
finish
relatively
good
drinkability
for
the
style
superlative
wonder
how
this
improved
in
the
bottle
with
several
years
of
aging
hope
i
have
the
patience
to
repeat
this
experiment
o
on
the
whole
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
flavorful
likable
beer
overall
my
first
ale
of
this
kind
i
will
pursue
the
genre
further
i
liked
it
but
it
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
maltier
ales
for
me
overall
this
is
a
winner
as
it
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
not
overpowering
but
allows
the
avid
beer
drinker
the
enjoyment
of
a
flanders
style
at
a
session
feel
cheers
the
cpj
o
not
a
great
flanders
red
at
all
for
me
pretty
standard
and
a
little
too
sweet
this
beer
poured
out
like
a
dark
red
wine
not
much
carbonation
here
the
beer
didnt
leave
much
in
way
of
lacing
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pungent
on
the
nose
giving
it
the
sour
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
tart
and
had
a
light
sour
cherry
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
flatter
side
and
not
overly
exciting
overall
its
a
decent
beer
in
my
opinion
id
like
to
give
the
grand
cru
a
try
sometime
rodenbach
grand
cru
it
aint
9
a
750ml
wonderful
mix
of
sour
and
malt
slight
sweetness
with
floral
notes
that
contrast
with
sour
and
acid
relatively
flat
consistent
with
sour
though
with
enough
head
to
release
lovely
aromas
and
contribute
to
mouth
feel
lots
of
body
and
flavor
for
5
2
beer
a
750ml
that
you
can
open
without
considering
how
early
you
need
to
get
up
the
next
day
o
very
refreshing
a
good
beer
but
iwould
like
a
little
more
sourness
d
this
is
of
course
a
classic
example
of
the
style
where
the
acidity
is
assertive
but
not
as
intense
as
in
the
grand
cru
there
is
a
lot
of
rich
dark
and
fruity
malt
that
creates
both
balance
and
interest
by
contrasting
the
sharp
acidity
carbonation
is
another
important
point
that
is
hit
upon
with
great
accuracy
and
it
pushes
the
intense
flavors
aside
in
the
finish
leaving
only
a
light
dry
and
acidic
fruitiness
lingering
on
the
palate
a
beer
that
everyone
interested
in
good
beer
must
try
and
a
perfect
introduction
to
sour
beer
overall
an
ok
beer
dont
think
i
would
try
it
again
i
need
to
try
the
grand
cru
still
d
high
easy
drinkin
very
repeatable
4
0
o
good
overall
the
flavor
is
lacking
just
a
bit
but
the
beer
is
quality
across
the
board
it
could
be
due
to
the
fact
its
on
the
cusp
of
the
best
by
date
but
its
hung
in
there
regardless
methinks
i
may
have
to
nab
a
fresh
bottle
d
this
one
was
great
for
taking
a
break
from
the
ipas
dipas
and
stouts
i
have
been
drinking
lately
the
flavor
is
unique
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
will
drink
again
supper
drinkable
and
a
great
feeling
tasting
beer
i
am
not
a
cider
fan
but
this
is
almost
a
cider
persons
beer
for
someone
who
prefers
beer
more
than
cider
bringing
in
all
the
good
qualities
of
cider
into
a
beer
right
here
with
just
a
touch
of
saison
brett
and
goodness
this
is
really
nice
and
reels
it
in
a
little
bit
toward
the
traditional
side
of
the
sour
ale
shore
if
youve
been
o
d
ing
on
the
more
powerful
sourer
american
versions
not
exactly
as
exquisite
as
id
remembered
and
hoped
but
an
excellent
springtime
quaff
nonetheless
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brownish
red
color
with
a
massive
fluffy
beige
head
that
impairs
my
ability
to
pour
a
full
glass
smells
of
cider
and
vinegar
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cork
sweet
fruity
tartness
fills
my
nostrils
cherries
vanilla
and
hints
of
oak
round
out
the
nose
luckily
the
vinegar
is
not
as
present
as
when
i
first
opened
her
up
taste
is
more
fruity
than
tart
slightly
tart
cherries
strained
over
a
sweet
malty
base
bits
of
oak
and
acetic
acid
in
there
really
not
what
i
was
expecting
lots
of
bubbles
medium
to
thin
body
chalky
sugary
fruity
mouthfeel
decent
easy
to
drink
beer
but
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
maybe
ive
totally
wrecked
my
palette
with
american
sour
ales
but
i
thought
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
subtle
whaaaatttt
surprise
surprise
surprise
a
belgium
that
is
pretty
dog
gone
good
cloudy
brown
big
cidervinegar
smell
but
the
taste
is
very
light
and
refreshing
crazy
i
would
not
go
crazy
and
would
shy
away
from
doing
a
sessionjust
too
sweet
and
tart
o
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
good
beer
cant
say
ill
seek
it
out
again
but
i
enjoyed
it
classic
for
a
reason
this
beer
is
like
listening
to
a
song
where
a
vocalist
can
hit
some
cool
notes
the
drummer
can
make
a
nice
back
beat
the
bassist
can
try
to
add
harmony
and
the
guitarist
can
rip
a
clean
solo
however
they
just
cant
seem
to
work
well
and
harmonize
together
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
despite
my
criticism
and
i
will
seek
it
out
again
rodenbach
has
a
red
colour
and
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
it
smells
like
berries
but
is
a
little
sour
the
taste
is
sour
and
a
little
fruity
the
aftertaste
is
sour
with
a
hint
of
honey
the
texture
is
bubbly
and
pretty
decent
overall
pretty
nice
better
than
the
last
flanders
red
that
i
had
o
a
true
classic
in
every
sense
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
from
the
true
masters
of
flanders
reds
overall
this
is
a
very
balanced
anad
smooth
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
the
sourness
isnt
too
overpowering
im
definitely
open
to
having
this
one
again
ooverall
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tried
it
was
my
first
sour
and
after
trying
this
i
am
going
to
try
many
many
more
cheers
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
appropriate
carbonation
and
body
and
an
easy
drinker
worth
your
time
to
try
this
one
d
ok
but
thin
and
watery
not
decent
aftertaste
you
have
a
sip
and
30
seconds
later
theres
no
taste
in
your
mouth
wheres
the
flanders
red
ale
wheres
the
oak
im
a
fan
while
certainly
a
good
beer
i
think
this
one
pales
in
comparison
to
the
grand
cru
it
doesnt
have
the
rich
fruitiness
complex
acidity
and
barnyard
funk
of
its
big
brother
that
said
it
is
just
as
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
this
would
be
a
nice
introduction
to
sour
ales
as
it
is
less
intense
on
the
palate
and
is
still
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
had
this
on
tap
somewhere
in
california
reviewing
this
from
my
notes
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
hints
of
amber
thin
offwhite
head
leaving
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
sour
cherry
and
sweet
brown
sugar
flavour
has
a
really
nice
tartness
to
it
complemented
by
the
sweetness
this
is
insanely
delicious
d
a
slow
and
savory
drink
not
something
youre
going
to
throw
back
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
i
want
more
d
very
drinkable
almost
like
a
cherry
soda
d
its
about
as
easy
a
drinker
as
they
come
i
do
enjoy
the
grand
cru
a
bit
more
but
if
seen
on
draft
it
would
be
a
hard
pass
up
again
not
bad
but
a
little
disappointing
given
the
rich
smell
not
nearly
enough
followthrough
but
easydrinking
nonetheless
d
this
is
a
great
beer
and
its
wonderfully
refreshing
the
drinkability
is
extremely
high
as
neither
the
sourness
nor
the
sweetness
get
out
of
hand
highly
recommended
from
the
750
ml
bottle
with
no
expiration
or
brewed
date
sampled
on
11111
the
pour
is
a
nice
looking
amberbrown
with
about
an
inch
of
silky
but
quickly
fading
head
some
ruby
hues
when
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
a
lot
like
vinegar
which
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
for
me
i
get
a
little
hint
of
malts
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
the
taste
is
quitre
sour
and
boozy
overall
drinkability
is
very
high
though
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
overall
this
is
a
nice
inexpensive
belgian
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
the
sweetness
up
front
of
juicy
cherries
and
berries
finishing
with
a
dry
brut
like
acidity
very
mellow
as
far
as
the
sharpness
of
the
tart
side
is
concerned
there
is
a
chance
this
is
almost
four
years
old
now
so
maybe
the
age
has
mellowed
the
whole
thing
out
a
bit
very
juicy
tasting
up
front
with
the
dry
tartness
rounding
out
the
end
but
not
in
a
way
that
overrides
the
sweetness
this
brew
ends
more
balanced
than
i
remember
other
examples
of
the
style
ending
all
and
all
this
is
simply
amazing
as
far
as
texture
and
drinkability
go
the
mouthfeel
is
only
slightly
chalky
and
is
far
from
thin
or
heavy
or
watery
the
drinkability
is
like
powerade
when
youre
really
thirsty
i
can
drink
powerade
pretty
damn
fast
hungover
super
tasty
soda
like
fizziness
as
well
as
a
bit
of
brown
ale
mellow
malts
too
overall
very
drinkable
and
balanced
not
as
sour
as
many
other
flanders
ales
restrained
funkiness
compared
with
others
a
refreshing
thrist
quenching
beer
tate
is
really
sharp
an
tart
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
really
well
done
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
robust
and
oaky
flavor
carbonation
is
gentle
adding
just
a
fizz
drinkability
is
about
what
you
would
expect
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
few
ounces
d
very
nice
being
as
how
this
isnt
as
acidic
as
most
of
the
flanders
ive
had
in
the
past
i
can
see
where
this
might
make
a
more
palatable
beer
for
some
people
cheers
i
could
easily
take
a
bath
in
this
beer
whats
not
to
like
not
as
sour
or
tart
as
other
flemish
reds
but
enough
sourness
to
make
it
clear
youre
drinking
something
exceptional
the
healthy
hit
of
pezlike
sugar
in
the
nose
is
inviting
then
the
light
body
and
the
tightness
of
the
taste
without
the
balsamic
twang
of
other
beers
of
this
style
just
keep
raising
the
glass
all
by
itself
low
alcohol
means
you
can
drink
several
at
one
sitting
im
sorry
i
had
only
one
bottle
in
the
house
at
the
time
d
this
is
one
amazing
beer
i
must
seek
it
out
again
coming
back

d

appreciate
sour
beers
and
this
is
not

so

so
good
so
i
will
press

very
refreshing
a
thin
beer
with
a
pungent

an
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
begs
to
be
drunk
quickly
i
like
the
red
aged
before
a
fresh
bottle
and
i
like
the
red
before
the
grand
cru
this
is
one
i
could
have
a
field
day
with
now
if
they
would
only
un
retire
redbach
than
ill
be
sitting
pretty
d
it
drank
quite
well
and
was
a
little
dissapointed
on
the
overall
tart
bite
it
had
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
think
im
just
spoiled
after
having
their
alexander
the
only
place
ive
ever
had
it
on
tap
was
at
the
new
albanian
brewing
company
public

formerly
known
as

os
public

mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
crisp
amount

drinkability
rates
fairly
high
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
summer
night
d
goes
down
easy
with
lots
of
complex
tastes
very
nice
more
sessionable
than
the
grand
cru
but
not
as
much
of
a
heavyweight
overall
i
remember
this
one
being
more
tart
than
it
was
here
its
a
bit
too
subdued
for
the
style
still
its
a
well
made
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
especially
for
those
just
getting
into
sours
hazy
copper
body
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
very
nominal

is
some
nominal
tartness
with
big
earthy
qualities
and
faint
berry
notes
wood
comes

faintly
on
the
finish
earth
on
the

with
a
pleasant

vinegar
and
lingering

on
the

very
drinkable
thin

with
very
clean

finally
a
place
that
has
this
on
tap
so
that
i
dont
have
to
buy
a
bottle
im
cheap
you
rock
ck
it
pours
a
seemingly
clear
though
rather
dark
ruby
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
vinegar
mandarin
oranges
pineapple
maple
syrup
sour
grapes
and
raspberries
the
taste
begins
with
some
o
those
sour
grapes
and
vinegar
notes
followed
by
some
wheat
lightly
roasted
malts
and
nutmeg
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sticky
finish
overall
a
tasty
flemish
offering
but
not
necessarily
something
i
see
myself
drinking
too
often
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
someone
who
is
interested
in
trying
out
a
sour
the
experience
was
not
overwhelming
for
a
novice
to
the
category
such
as
myself
i
could
see
drinking
two
or
three
of
these
but
definitely
taking
my
time
sipping
and
enjoying
the
flavors
if
you
like
a
really
sour
beer
this
one
maybe
a
little
too
tame
for
you
very
nice
drinking
beer
that
has
the
tart
characteristics
that
a
flanders
red
should
have
but
is
not
overly
sour

for
so

this

is

beer
is

mildly

sweet

slightly
tart
on

its
highly
drinkable
and
really

the

considerably
more

but
this
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
beer
the
beer
pours

the
aroma
is

with
some

right

good
sweetness
balanced
with
a
light
note
of
vinegar
tartness
and
dark
malt
this
is
the
kind
of
sour
that
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
lots
of
really
good
flavour
but
with
a
solid
backing
of
refreshing
tartness
not
heavily
carbonated
but
extremely
refreshing
quite
a
balance
of
sourtartness
and
sweet
maltiness
combined
with
the
smooth

this
is
one
infinitely
drinkable
ale
wonderfully
well
put

delectably
drinkable
and
nicely
quaffable
good
interplay
between
the
sweetness
and
the
sourness
throughout
works
well
as
an
apéritif
as
now
im
hungry
sandwich
anyone
d
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
beer
highly
drinkable
d
very
good
this
seems
like
a
it
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
this
style
of
beer
i
will
be
seeking
out
the
other
beers
that
rodenbach
makes
very
soon
drinkability
another
nice
intro
sour
from
rodenbach
i
could
certainly
put
down
a
couple
glasses
of
this
i
would
get
this
again
d
this
is
truly
a
wonderful
beer
thats
a
classic
example
of
the
style
if
you
see
a
bottle
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
it
not
sure
how
much
having
this
from
a
can
made
a
difference
i
drank
from
my
duvel
tulip
but
am
curious
and
will
try
the
bottle
version
before
i
drink
the
other
can
i
bought
2006
vintage
beautiful
mahagony
brown
amber
tinted
pour
nice
creamy
beige
head
that
resettles
to
about
a
half
inch
with
a
swirl
of
the
glass
yummy
balsamic
and
port
aromas
taste
is
less
than
what
the
grand
cru
has
to
offer
but
still
nice
the
balsamic
notes
and
sweet
tarts
are
all
firing
but
are
more
muted
than
the
gc
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
but
still
very
smooth
drinkability
is
great
definately
a
sessionable
beer
while
this
is
still
a
shadow
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
it
remains
enjoyable
and
i
am
pleased
to
have
a
ready
supply
of
this
outstanding
beer
once
again
kinda
a
yawn
for
me
just
not
that
interesting
drinkability
ok
not
my
favorite
as
far
as
flanders
reds
go
this
one
is
passable
it
certainly
sated
my
sour
cravings
at
least
for
one
night
overall
cant
beat
a
good
classic
flanders
red
i
prefer
the
grand
cru
this
is
an
average
flanders
red
but
it
is
cheap
and
easily
available
overall
this
is
a
classic
flanders
red
ale
if
you
like
this
style
beer
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
the
pour
is
solid
mildly
hazy
deep
red
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
vanishes
quite
rapidly
the
nose
is
quite
excellent
a
beautiful
blend
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
cherries
red
wine
and
a
little
vinegar
tannin
character
is
quite
low
this
is
fruity
tart
and
quite
vinous
these
flavors
are
replicated
on
the
palate
opening
vinous
along
with
vanilla
cherries
brown
sugar
and
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
some
vinegar
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
just
very
very
enjoyable
and
very
refreshing
ive
had
aged
bottles
of
this
and
i
have
to
admit
i
like
this
better

d
quite
good

d

flanders

while
the
appearance
might

this
is
still
a

beer
poured
from

that
was
caged
and
corked
into
a

no

on
the

about
an

that

does
not
have
a
very
high
drinkability
to
me
all
and
all
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
probably
not
reach
for
it
again
probably
a
brew
a
wine
lover
would
enjoy
more
than
me
drinkability
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sour
beer
sour
enough
to
accentuate
the
fruit
flavors
but
probably
not
sour
enough
to
turn
off
people
who
arent
sour
fans
d
not
as
sour
as
some
people
make
it
out
to
be
though
it
is
sour
it
is
not
unbearable
wont
have
you
reaching
for
a
handful
of
jellybeans
to
negate
the
bitterness
very
smooth
and
unique
and
i
definitely
would
drink
this
with
a
nice
roast
maybe
even
for
leisure
i
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
the
nose
is
strongly
reminiscent
of
balsamic
vinegar
and
flavorings
are
also
found
in
taste
this
is
certainly
a
little
acid
following
the
fruity
side
but
there
is
light
it
collects
woody
notes
there
is
also
this
beer
a
little
winey
flavor
that
gives
this
side
bittersweet
highly
characteristic
the
finish
meanwhile
is
quite
sour
but
still
very
sweet
a
beer
with
a
nice
balance
and
a
unique
taste
but
can
easily
divide
the
beer
lovers
if
the
old
logo
mark
was
hate
it
or
love
it
which
gives
the
aroma
a
wine
like
character
a
touch
of
an
raw
sugar
sweetness
overall
the
aroma
is
not
overly
strong
the
brew
starts
off
tart
and
dry
with
lemon

d
not

as
some
of
the
flanders

that
ive
had
which
can
be
nice
not
quite

flavorful
either
though
tasty
and
drinkable
nonetheless
a
nice
refined
flanders
red
ale
i
really
enjoy
the
tartness
of
flanders
reds
and
this
beer
mutes
these
flavors
a
bit
with
the
oakaged
part
of
the

blend
the
tartness
is
refined
the
oak
is
refined
and
i
would
prefer
either
flavor
to
be
less
refined
and
more
forward
the
mouthfeel
is
gently
fizzy
and
sticks
very
pleasantly
on

tart

in

there
is
a

of

its
not

beer
if
it
was

could
have

with

drinkability
while
i
would
like
more
tartness
and
oaky
complexity
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
might
drink
this
again
but
it
is
unlikely
i
will
buy
it
again
i
had
two
bottles
in
my
stash
and
it
took
every
ounce
of
my
being
to
resist
quaffing
down
the
second
bottle
as
soon
as
the
first
was
finished
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
murky
amber
almost
purple
color
a
decent
white
head
but
little
retention
the
aroma
is
quite
complex
initially
sour
and
woody
the
sweet
fruits
and
candies
stand
out
also
the
flavor
is
nice
but
also
very
drinkable
an
initial
sourness
and
lots
of
notice
of
the
aging
process
woody
oak
flavors
throughout
the
boy
of
the
flavor
is
full
of
sweet
chocolates
and
cherries
some
light
yeast
also
the
finish
leaves
quickly
and
clean
i
found
consuming
a
lot
of
this
to
be
quite
easy
and
fun
a
good
beer
for
sure
taste
is
tart
very
tart
wow
this
is
hard
a
woody
taste
under
the
tartness
with
a
fake
sweet
sauce
covering
this
all
a
hard
to
drink
beer
with
an
artificial
sweetness
and
a
agrresive
sour
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
theres
a
slight
haze
to
the
deep
redbrown
colour
of
this
beer
a
skim
of
fine
beige
bubbles
and
collar
of
rocky
ones
appeared
after
the
pour
and
clung
to
the
glass
in
spotty
clumps
during
each
sip
earthy
and
tart
aroma
notes
of
tobacco
leaf
and
wood
strawberries
mild
acetic
acid
sour
cherries
and
cotton
candy
same
traits
in
the
flavour
very
well
balanced
it
finished
with
berry
sweetness
and
acetic
tartness
with
a
dash
of
musty
wood
at
the
end
medium
bodied
with
smooth
airy
carbonation
and
a
lightly
astringent
dryness
very
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
tartness
present
a
solid
beer
all
around
d
great
session
beer
drinkability
i
have
to
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
this
is
a
beer
you
could
sip
along
with
dinner
especially
italian
food
the
way
you
would
a
glass
of
wine
if
you
are
a
wine
drinker
of
any
kind
or
a
fan
of
red
ales
and
i
am
both
i
strongly
suggest
you
try
this
beer
at
the
very
least
it
will
be
like
no
brew
youve
ever
had
before
drinkability
is
very
solid
i
enjoy
the
tart
taste
and
smooth
finish
still
a
good
effort
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
superb
drinkability
notes
this
is
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
it
is
a
slow
sipper
that
is
very
enjoyable
small
amounts
drinkability
excellent
i
could
sip
a
couple
of
these
all
night
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
more
flanders
reds
drinkablity
very
drinkable
a
bit
cheaper
than
grand
cru
so
it
is
great
for
a
session

i
wanted
to
try
a
new
style
read
good
things
about
flemish
sour
beers
so
gave
this
a
try
based
on
a
recommendation
i
was
however
quite
skeptical
after
reading
reviews
vinegar
that
doesnt
sound
appealing
at
all
so
the
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
small
head
it
does
indeed
smell
and
taste
quite
a
bit
like
vinegar
the
flavor
is
dark
fruits
with
some
cherry
and
vinegar
it
is
a
little
sour
but
not
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
there
is
a
winey
presence
about
it
the
finish
and
aftertaste
is
a
bit
weird
and
bland
overall
its
not
horrible
and
easier
drinking
than
i
feared
but
i
dont
really
like
it
the
first
sip
i
had
was
a
little
gross
but
it
grew
a
little
on
me
still
i
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
with
a
small
12
ounce
sample
as
is
i
had
a
big
bottle
and
halfway
through
i
didnt
even
want
to
finish
it
of
course
i
did
finish
it
and
honestly
it
was
better
as
it
warmed
a
bit
if
i
ever
have
it
again
ill
note
to
let
it
warm
a
little
dtartness
takes
some
adjustment
but
ultimately
it
is
refreshing
with
that
subtle
sweetness
pulling
me
back
for
the
next
sip
this
is
my
first
flanders
sour
and
its
quite
good
very
different
but
not
unapproachable
would
love
to
find
more
of
this
stuff
another
one
bites
the
tart
an
heir
to
the
flemish
king
grand
cru
cola
stripped
of
its
sugar
replaced
with
dry
lemon
peel
and
yogurt
zest
the
sour
squeeze
is
irresistable
never
overstepping
its
boundaries
kiwi
burn
and
cabernet
alliance
to
create
one
of
the
most
grandly
mysterious
and
overly
erotic
ales
to
bless
the
human
race
rodenbach
sets
a
standard
as
well
as
an
example
to
follow
bravo
the
rodenbach
flemish
sour
ale
is
a
treat
to
drink
this
beer
marches
to
the
beat
of
its
own
drum
the
deep
reddish
abyss
of
color
is
unlike
any
beer
i
have
ever
seen
a
category
of
its
own
a
sour
smell
that
stings
the
nostrils
makes
you
question
if
this
is
a
beer
at
all
now
for
the
drink
thick
lightly
carbonated
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
that
slides
right
down
a
sour
aftershock
hits
the
palate
with
a
vigor
reminiscent
of
wine
this
is
the
beer
of
the
gods
let
us
drink
and
pray
d
this
is
like
the
training
wheels
of
sour
beers
very
good
beer
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
nice
pseudo
session
beer
my
lust
for
funky
and
or
sour
beers
was
sated
for
one
evening
the
hunger
grows
now
d
i
havent
had
many
sour
beers
but
to
date
this
is
the
best
one
of
the
bunch
that
i
have
had
i
actually
finished
off
the
entire
glass
from
the
start
i
knew
i
wouldnt
like
this
one
very
much
it
was
way
too
much
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
the
thing
that
turned
me
off
the
most
was
how
tart
this
beer
was
im
used
to
the
more
sweet
and
complex
abbey
ales
so
this
was
a
real
shock
approachable
yet
still
an
interesting
flanders
red
low
abv
helps
drinkability
i
could
not
drink
this
everyday
but
it
would
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
every
once
in
awhile
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
isnt
usually
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
drink
a
lot
of
but
this
one
was
pretty
decent
taste
mouthfeel
subtle
fruity
sweetness
leads
into
flavors
of
tart
cherries
red
wine
and
balsamic
vinegar
light
on
the
tongue
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
significantly
less
complex
than
the
grand
cru
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
brew
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
paired
with
food
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
noticeably
the
lesser
of
the
magnificent
rodenbach
grand
cru
served
in
my
delirium
tremens
tulip
poured
an
opaque
purplishbrown
with
a
1
5
inch
offwhite
head
with
copious
ringlets
head
subsided
to
a
halfinch
cap
within
about
a
minute
before
eventually
dissipating
into
a
thin
skim
of
foam
that
coalesced
around
the
shoulders
some
spotty
streaks
of
lacing
with
good
retention
nose
had
a
vinous
quality
with
sour
cherries
and
a
mild
vinegarlike
character
detected
towards
the
back
tasted
of
sour
grape
juice
and
again
a
mild
vinegar
quality
but
not
overpoweringly
so
with
a
mild
oakiness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
left
a
light
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
a
pleasant
dry
tart
finish
i
liked
this
much
more
than
i
anticipated
but
this
is
definitely
not
for
daily
consumption
in
my
opinion
a
dense
purplish
brown
body
with
a
pencilthin
white
head
intimidating
yet
beguiling
sourbut
not
sour
patchfresh
and
flowery
intense
lightbodied
but
the
presence
is
apparent
clean
no
tracing
on
the
glass
is
proof
so
much
that
the
mouth
could
forget
the
experience
seconds
after
wow
a
tartness
early
with
sugary
sweetness
throughoutand
yet
a
mellow
fizzy
finish
the
beers
as
fun
as
it
gets
pleasantly
poppy
and
refreshing
especially
on
a
humid
evening
such
as
this
d
this
is
a
style
i
could
get
used
to
i
expected
something
good
but
this
was
almost
mindbending
thoroughly
complex
and
sophisticated
like
a
lambic
crossed
with
an
english
pale
ale
not
something
id
want
to
gulp
down
without
noticing
the
subtleties
but
i
easily
could
worth
the
money
for
me
and
i
will
surely
have
several
of
these
on
hand
at
all
times
nice
crisp
refreshing
flemish
red
smell
is
sour
cherries
and
funk
taste
again
the
sour
fruit
with
a
significant
presence
of
cider
vinegar
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
flemish
reds
but
that
helps
the
drinkability
considerably
i
would
consider
this
the
perfect
beer
to
match
to
some
seafood
mussels
clams
for
lunch
on
a
hot
day
if
at
all
possible
i
would
recommend
getting
the
6
pack
over
the
750ml
as
this
is
the
perfect
afternoon
beer
to
have
one
or
two
of
on
a
nice
day
d
refreshing
and
not
one
of
the
usual
summer
beer
styles
wheat
beers
etc
very
drinkable
and
would
imagine
it
would
pair
well
with
certain
desserts
plain
cheesecake
for
example
a
different
style
than
i
am
used
to
and
certainly
one
i
will
return
to
in
the
future
drinkability
three
words
all
day
long
a
fine
example
of
a
flanders
red
its
got
all
the
familiar
characteristics
that
lovers
of
the
style
will
enjoy
but
its
mild
enough
that
novices
should
not
be
put
off
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
the
duchesse
but
still
very
good
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
grand
cru
recommended
i
love
to
drink
the
sours
on
a
hot
day
it
is
very
refreshing
and
i
finished
the
bottle
with
no
problem
at
all
i
must
admit
i
did
not
like
this
at
first
but
the
taste
kind
of
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
more
of
it
which
i
truly
respect
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
if
you
are
looking
to
try
something
new
the
body
is
moderate
a
bit
fuller
than
what
im
looking
for
but
still
good
carbonation
is
present
but
not
over
powering
overall
a
great
beer
for
sure
taste
almost
like
it
smells
with
a
mellow
sourness
backed
with
dark
cherry
and
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
sweetness
in
a
word
complex
dont
drink
this
too
cold
or
youll
lose
out
on
its
nuanced
silkiness
not
a
fan
of
lambicfruitystyled
beers
but
this
i
liked
d
awesome
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
the
duchesse
i
will
be
getting
another
for
sure
wonderful
brew
d
very
good
flanders
red
low
alcohol
means
you
can
really
do
some
damage
want
something
funky
and
quenching
drink
a
750
of
this
palate
is
right
up
there
with
duchesse
du
bourgogne
hard
to
distinguish
passion
fruits
pleasant
vinegary
sour
note
and
a
slight
soapy
component
on
the
finish
yes
my
glass
is
clean
pours
a
very
deep
ruby
color
almost
opaque
with
a
nice
big
red
tinged
head
at
first
but
quickly
dissapates
smells
like
straight
sour
apple
some
oak
and
black
cherry
very
intense
this
one
may
be
turned
it
is
well
out
of
date
and
i
am
only
trying
it
to
sell
if
it
is
still
sellable
at
the
abc
liquors
i
work
at
according
to
the
bottle
though
it
says
a
sharp
bouquet
taste
is
a
bit
bland
as
i
said
it
is
out
of
date
by
a
year
but
still
has
a
sour
apple
and
mild
oak
to
it
very
metallic
aftertaste
and
virtually
no
carbonation
doesnt
taste
skunked
so
this
may
be
its
true
taste
the
sour
taste
isnt
too
overpowering
and
yeilds
some
sweetness
on
the
palate
i
believe
this
one
is
still
salvagable
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
style
and
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
very
much
this
would
make
a
great
alternative
session
beer
but
its
pretty
onedimentional
and
lacks
the
complexity
i
normally
look
for
had
this
on
tap
at
summits
in
snellville
ga
a
while
ago
poured
a
ruby
red
tinted
with
dark
brown
slight
head
that
faded
to
a
ring
quite
acetic
on
the
nose
and
with
aromas
of
muscadine
grapes
tart
currants
and
some
muskiness
as
well
as
vinegar
taste
is
similar
and
and
quite
tart
on
the
finish
but
slightly
more
mellow
up
front
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
that
helps
temper
the
acetic
qualities
as
well
and
also
some
tart
raspberry
throughout
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sour
leading
this
to
be
quite
a
refreshing
beer
not
as
complex
as
the
grand
cru
but
simple
and
quenching
i
think
this
beer
would
nicely
cut
through
a
fruit
laden
cheesecake
or
any
high
fat
dessert
that
also
has
fruit
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
beer
before
drinkability
very
to
be
brutally
honest
tart
but
doesnt
pucker
your
mouth
leaves
you
wanting
more
with
a
short
lived
aftertatse
and
has
a
nice
low
abv
for
drinkability
plus
the
added
fact
that
its
to
the
point
with
its
cherry
flavor
dits
drinkable
but
ill
pass
im
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
and
its
interesting
but
its
not
for
me
very
tasty
an
after
dinner
brew
for
me
this
was
my
first
try
at
a
flanders
red
and
it
hit
the
expectations
but
i
need
to
expand
my
tastes
in
this
variety
so
i
can
get
a
better
grasp
on
this
unique
brew
d
pretty
good
nice
easy
to
get
sour
ale
for
a
good
fix
im
not
in
love
i
much
prefer
the
grand
cru
or
a
duchesse
still
a
tasty
beer
but
if
im
going
out
of
the
way
for
the
style
ill
look
for
others
first
this
really
puts
the
duchesse
to
shame
try
with
artisan
cheese
grilled
meats
duck
or
even
chinese
food
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
no
matter
how
much
i
like
the
taste
i
cant
get
through
more
than
one
smooth
fine
texture
and
very
drinkable
the
only
red
in
the
beer
is
found
in
the
hues
of
this
tawny
brown
creation
sour
funk
in
the
smell
and
a
smell
thats
tamed
the
flavor
seemed
a
little
muted
by
the
carbonation
that
hits
the
tongue
but
the
balance
is
good
the
sour
and
tart
taste
is
pleasant
no
question
about
that
its
the
low
amount
of
overall
flavor
though
thats
reflected
in
the
taste
score
im
giving
it
that
keeps
it
from
being
a
highly
recommended
pick
nonetheless
an
interesting
beer
in
an
interesting
style
humboldt
fog
made
for
an
interesting
pair
with
this
the
low
acidity
seemed
to
cut
the
creamy
richiness
with
a
lingering
farmhouse
aftertaste
of
the
cheese
i
have
been
slowingly
getting
into
sour
beer
and
this
was
a
very
good
mildly
sour
and
sweet
beer
it
poured
out
with
no
head
and
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
color
you
could
feel
the
carbonation
tingling
your
mouth
and
the
taste
was
very
good
this
is
a
must
try
for
people
trying
to
get
into
more
complex
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
hued
brown
that
has
no
head
nose
is
a
pretty
smooth
mix
of
wood
and
fruit
flavor
has
that
sour
tone
to
it
and
definite
fruit
and
wood
as
well
smooth
feel
with
a
low
but
biting
carbonation
nice
to
drink
but
youd
have
to
be
able
to
appreciate
the
style
to
really
enjoy
this
one
pours
a
nice
red
brown
color
bubly
but
very
little
head
apple
vinegar
aroma
but
not
overwhelming
and
even
a
tad
sweet
very
tingly
but
not
too
intense
carbonation
lightly
sour
taste
with
apples
and
cherries
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sour
ales
ive
tried
not
particularly
exciting
its
missing
the
complexity
and
tartness
of
many
of
these
beers
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
and
probably
a
good
introduction
to
this
unusual
and
to
some
shocking
style
i
have
read
many
reviewspostsforumsetc
about
how
this
isnt
the
beer
it
once
was
that
may
be
true
but
i
never
had
that
version
all
i
can
say
is
holy
cow
i
love
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
appropriately
carbonated
but
the
finish
is
too
sticky
and
unclean
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
i
enjoy
the
rodenbach
grand
cru
much
more
but
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
find
it
really
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
the
smell
is
mildly
tart
the
taste
is
also
tart
with
some
red
grape
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
smoother
and
less
spritzy
than
their
grand
cru
this
beer
is
not
as
intense
as
the
grand
cru
and
is
a
fine
sour
beer
this
one
poured
ruby
with
a
beautiful
color
and
cloudiness
from
all
angles
but
there
was
absolutely
no
head
in
any
way
shape
or
form
the
smell
was
yeasty
with
both
grapes
and
vinegar
showing
up
strong
the
taste
was
extremely
tart
and
extremely
fruity
and
in
a
lot
of
ways
reminded
me
more
of
strongbow
than
any
other
flanders
red
ive
had
it
had
a
more
severe
bite
than
i
personally
prefer
but
it
was
still
pretty
smooth
going
down
frankly
i
think
this
one
was
okay
but
if
another
flanders
red
was
available
id
take
that
instead
d
the
alcohol
is
nice
and
low
eluding
detection
throughout
the
glass
the
slight
tartness
is
welcome
and
the
fruitiness
from
the
spontaneous
fermentation
and
aging
is
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
wonerfull
example
of
the
style
quite
complex
yet
well
balanced
and
pairs
well
with
many
dishes
best
with
some
strong
cheese
nuts
and
fresh
fruit
also
a
nice
palate
cleanser
between
courses
for
any
fine
meal
d
have
to
be
careful
with
this
one
very
drinkable
kinda
reminds
me
of
the
cough
medicine
dimetapp
but
sweeter
ok
before
i
get
panned
for
the
low
scores
let
me
just
say
that
either
the
rest
of
you
are
lemmings
scoring
it
high
because
you
think
you
should
or
you
just
enjoy
this
really
unique
challenging
style
of
beer
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
tried
to
like
this
beer
i
didnt
like
this
beer
it
poured
beautifully
ontap
at
3fs
pub
a
deep
reddish
amber
mostly
clear
with
a
superthick
rocky
creamy
bigass
lasting
pinkish
head
and
lacing
nose
was
of
cherriesberries
and
acetic
sourness
along
with
some
musty
barnyardy
aromas
taste
was
sweet
upfront
dominated
by
sourness
kinda
like
drinking
turnedold
juice
light
bodied
spritzy
with
a
drying
sour
finish
tastes
more
like
a
sparkling
rose
wine
that
beer
no
hop
presence
per
the
style
this
might
go
well
with
a
cherry
pie
750
ml
bottle
i
picked
up
two
bottles
of
this
and
two
of
the
grand
cru
from
healthy
spirits
in
san
francisco
ive
had
the
cru
before
but
i
should
drink
them
back
to
back
for
real
fun
in
any
case
while
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
grand
cru
the
regular
rodenbach
is
reasonably
close
giving
you
about
70
of
the
grand
cru
experience
a
because
it
has
a
bit
lower
abv
the
rodenbach
makes
it
a
better
session
beer
like
the
cru
this
is
a
defining
example
of
the
flemish
red
style
poured
from
a
250ml
bottle
from
pp
bottle
shop
into
a
new
belgium
snifter
poured
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
thin
head
that
faded
like
a
soda
pop
head
smell
is
a
faint
sour
cherry
smellwith
hints
of
wild
yeast
sourness
taste
is
a
little
more
foward
but
still
not
very
powerful
with
cherry
raspberries
a
slight
oak
vanilla
flavor
and
of
course
a
slight
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
a
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
red
ale
which
makes
it
a
classic
but
with
some
many
extreme
and
well
crafted
sour
reds
out
their
i
would
say
just
above
average
and
not
the
very
best
of
the
style
some
of
this
finally
made
its
way
to
sd
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
pour
of
it
at
obriens
poured
a
very
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
and
a
light
carbonation
only
a
slight
lacing
the
aroma
immediately
hit
me
with
cherries
both
sour
and
fresh
there
is
a
definite
vinegar
presence
but
not
overpowering
like
some
examples
of
the
style
possible
hints
of
oak
as
well
the
taste
is
incredible
dominated
by
tart
cherries
some
vanilla
and
minimal
vinegar
that
only
helps
the
balance
also
some
ripe
apple
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
coating
allowing
even
the
smallest
sip
to
linger
its
actually
a
very
refreshing
example
of
this
style
and
the
more
i
get
to
know
it
the
flanders
red
is
becoming
more
of
a
friend
than
an
acquaintance
really
want
to
try
the
grand
cru
now
as
i
heard
its
much
better
d
a
very
smooth
and
silky
drink
with
a
great
gentle
sourness
makes
for
a
good
desert
beer
d
delicious
i
could
have
another
but
it
isnt
really
a
session
beer
especially
not
at
7
a
glass
had
heard
a
lot
of
great
things
about
this
beer
and
the
people
at
obriens
were
ranting
and
raving
about
it
a
few
days
ago
so
i
had
to
see
how
it
was
for
myself
very
good
for
the
price
would
drink
again
in
the
future
want
to
try
their
grand
cru
because
i
have
heard
that
is
even
better
my
first
flanders
red
poured
out
into
a
flute
billowy
head
lacy
retention
nice
darktea
color
big
aromas
of
raspberriescherry
fruitswood
aromas
flavor
is
exactly
what
what
i
was
hoping
for
tart
applelike
crisp
dry
finish
a
little
vinegary
but
thats
what
i
expected
this
beer
would
make
a
great
apertitif
as
opposed
to
the
common
glass
of
champagne
will
definatly
buy
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
makes
a
great
start
to
a
round
of
reviews
d
i
really
dug
this
beer
would
like
to
have
it
again
but
it
was
7
for
about
8
oz
so
it
will
have
to
be
a
rare
treat
the
aroma
is
right
on
stylewise
very
similar
to
duchese
horse
blamket
and
very
sour
aroma
next
to
zero
head
and
gone
in
60
seconds
dark
puplebrown
color
initial
flavor
is
heavy
sweet
as
is
the
finish
which
iis
a
good
thing
i
would
buy
more
of
this
but
its
not
as
readily
available
as
the
duchese
this
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
oak
and
hints
of
vinegar
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
tart
sourness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
fine
flemish
red
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
an
excellent
example
of
the
flanders
red
style
often
imitated
but
never
duplicated
the
beer
has
a
red
almost
burgandy
color
to
it
a
generous
tannish
head
sits
atop
that
body
the
flavors
hits
you
with
a
genorous
helping
of
soursweet
while
ending
in
a
balanced
malt
profile
a
classic
example
of
the
style
i
would
also
note
the
barmistress
stated
firmly
that
the
alcohol
content
was
4
8
percent
and
not
5
0
percent
as
advertised
she
knew
her
stuff
i
am
not
sure
why
i
have
not
tried
this
brew
before
since
i
really
do
like
the
flander
brews
and
the
sour
aspect
of
them
this
brew
poured
to
a
color
that
has
a
red
tone
to
a
brown
profile
had
a
nice
light
tan
colored
head
that
holds
for
a
bit
the
aroma
shows
of
its
tartsour
side
from
the
get
go
with
a
nice
fruit
mix
i
know
that
this
is
a
blend
of
brew
that
was
in
oak
but
i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
or
am
not
picking
up
the
oak
notes
while
i
like
the
aroma
to
me
it
seems
to
be
more
one
dimensional
than
i
would
like
the
flavor
of
course
highlights
the
fruit
and
sour
profile
but
to
me
seems
to
be
a
little
more
harsh
with
a
stronger
acidic
note
than
i
would
like
to
see
again
just
like
with
the
aroma
i
am
not
picking
up
the
properties
that
i
would
expect
from
a
being
aged
part
of
it
in
oak
to
me
this
is
a
solid
brew
like
this
type
of
brew
but
in
my
book
it
is
not
in
the
same
book
as
mestreechs
aajit
monks
or
duchesse
i
would
get
this
brew
again
but
would
reach
for
these
others
before
this
one
just
mu
opinion
if
you
are
big
on
wine
and
sour
patch
kids
then
you
are
going
to
like
this
looking
at
the
review
people
do
like
it
hats
off
to
you
nice
to
finally
try
this
beer
body
really
has
a
nice
reddish
color
to
it
with
a
nice
head
as
well
the
head
fades
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
sharp
edge
to
it
but
a
lot
of
nice
fruity
smells
in
the
as
well
flavor
is
sharply
sour
at
first
but
more
of
the
malt
profile
comes
through
as
you
sip
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
seems
a
little
thin
drinakbility
is
also
ok
i
enjoy
it
but
i
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
onefinger
head
aroma
is
nice
and
sour
upfront
with
fruitiness
showing
through
thats
reminiscent
of
sour
apple
in
some
ways
taste
is
somewhat
sour
upfront
and
fades
with
a
mild
pucker
towards
the
back
of
the
throat
again
it
reminds
me
of
sour
apple
in
some
ways
not
too
sour
either
ive
never
really
had
many
sour
ales
but
i
would
say
that
this
one
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
it
claims
to
represent
very
drinkable
too
d
would
recommend
as
an
intro
to
sour
beers
from
now
on
have
always
shyd
away
from
the
funk
but
my
now
be
a
little
more
open
for
experimentation
dont
drink
and
review
very
fine
example
of
a
flemish
sour
ale
and
i
can
understand
why
it
is
the
standard
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
but
i
still
prefer
the
duchesse
obviously
a
staple
for
the
flanders
red
style
pleasantly
tart
but
not
over
the
top
very
well
rounded
mouthfeel
is
fine
here
but
not
as
good
as
other
flemmish
ales
i
have
had
still
for
the
price
its
a
good
buy
drinkability
really
good
for
a
beer
of
this
character
it
is
definitely
not
a
beer
that
everyone
would
like
but
if
you
are
into
this
type
of
brew
it
is
really
easy
drinking
really
tasty
and
goes
down
very
smooth
the
beer
seemed
overly
carbonated
and
felt
that
way
it
was
almost
like
drinking
a
less
sweet
cherry
cola
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
but
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
easy
drinking
but
mainly
because
there
werent
any
overpowering
flavors
im
not
the
biggest
sour
ale
connoisseur
but
this
one
seems
pretty
mild
not
overly
sour
or
sweet
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
d
very
tasty
one
of
my
tops
flanders
sours
maybe
only
second
to
the
duchess
drinkability
archétype
des

d
not
something
for
every
day
drinking
but
a
beer
that
ill
be
drinking
again
for
sure
nice
low
key
sort

garnet

decent
level

quite
fruity
and
somewhat
funky

fairly
sour

not
offensivly
so
moderate

flavor
slight

good

to
be

in
the
finish
very
nice
and
enjoyable

i
havnt
had
very
many
sour
beers
really
liked
this
one
overall
pours
a
dark
mahogany

nice

tiny
fizzy

tiny

left
behind
the
nose
is

the
taste

lots
of
cherryraspberry
theres
some
funk
going
on
in
there
medium
body
drinkable
not
that
impressed
with
this
one
ive
had
way
way
way
better
flanders
in
the
past
interestingly
contrary
to
what
i
expected
the
ontap
version
seemed
a
bit
better
red
body
hints
of
a
more
cherry
oak
color
the
head
is
pretty
thick
but
only
about
12
inch
tall
offwhite
in
color
i
could
smell
this
from
across
the
room
huge
raspberry
black
currant
and
lemon
scents
the
taste
is
mostly
lemon
and
hops
with
raspberry
and
black
currant
coming
through
on
top
of
it
all
the
carbonation
kind
of
pops
in
your
mouth
very
tart
and
tangy
but
the
sweetness
keeps
it
in
check
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
wonderful
beer
but
definitely
not
for
everyone
or
every
night
light
body
with
sharp
prickly
carbonation
very
dry
refreshing
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
sour
beers
and
i
dont
generally
think
they
are
all
that
but
they
can
be
nice
when
im
in
the
mood
rodenbach
is
the
first
ive
had
that
i
could
imagine
myself
really
getting
into
drinkability
is
great
for
winelovers
brewlovers
will
also
appreciate
the
smoothness
and
subtle
flavors
at
work
here
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
flanders
red
and
an
excellent
brew
to
try
cheers
i
could
see
how
others
may
not
like
it
myself
personally
however
i
found
it
to
be
quite
a
lovely
treat
i
was
quite
amazed
with
it
actually
it
has
such
unique
character
and
even
more
to
its
credit
i
doubt
the
one
bottle
i
had
was
enough
to
really
understand
this
beer
to
fully
experience
its
character
i
must
revisit
sweetsour
flavors
again
quite
different
from
anything
ive
ever
had
but
not
in
a
positive
way
the
body
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
tarty
and
sour
with
hints
of
fruits
and
spice
the
finish
lets
me
know
i
am
drinking
something
good
it
grabs
hold
and
does
not
let
go
dthis
is
tasty
indeed
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
this
beer
at
a
tasting
with
a
duvel
representative
so
i
got
a
taste
of
both
the
beer
and
the
history
the
beer
itself
was
like
nothing
ive
had
before
a
crisp
dark
red
color
with
a
redtinted
creamy
head
the
smell
was
sour
and
fruity
letting
you
know
that
youre
in
for
something
different
hated
it
at
first
taste
got
used
to
it
by
the
second
loved
it
by
the
third
a
unique
pwoerful
sour
acidic
taste
with
cherries
and
grapes
as
the
dominant
taste
that
goes
with
the
malt
it
was
almost
more
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
full
delicious
and
unique
as
far
as
the
making
of
the
beer
i
learned
that
75
of
each
bottle
is
freshly
made
while
25
is
front
a
pervious
batch
there
are
20
types
of
yeast
in
the
beer
it
is
aged
23
years
in
oak
barrels
not
your
typical
beery
kind
of
a
beer
but
definately
worth
adding
to
your
repertoire
amazingly
my
first
try
of
this
beer
its
not
a
style
i
seek
out
much
but
this
is
a
classicpoured

large

faintsomewhat
spritzy
mouthfeel
light
and
drinkable
starts
out
with
a
big
tartness
that
wakes
you
up
after
that
some
toastiness
and
oak
shows
thru
into
the
finish
the
puckering
tartness
is
always
there
it
never
really
totally
leaves
a
nice
complex
but
refreshing
beer
it
is
a
classic
for
a
reason
d
never
had
this
style
before
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
trying
i
think
it
would
be
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
recommended
im
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
might
be
the
best
example
ive
had
it
has
a
nice
ambercherry
color
and
that
classic
aroma
with
a
hint
of
barnyard
yes
thats
a
good
thing
and
some
sourness
the
initial
flavor
is
sour
cherry
and
some
orange
peel
with
some
floral
qualities
and
a
clean
tartness
that
sparkles
on
the
tongue
what
pluses
this
for
me
is
the
finish
which
had
a
faintly
bitter
crispness
both
complex
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
flemish
ale
a
bit
subtle
perhaps
due
to
age
it
was
consumed
fully
3
months
beyond
the
best
by
date
though
im
not
sure
what
affect
if
any
that
would
have
had
not
my
favorite
within
style
by
a
long
shot
it
was
too
mellow
and
undefined
for
my
tastes
d
this
is
a
standard
in
my
beer
drinking
repertoire
everyone
i
meet
who
has
never
had
a
flemish
sour
is
amazed
that
i
drink
it
as
it
turns
off
a
lot
of
people
but
i
find
it
an
excellent
change
of
paste
from
other
styles
of
beer
d
first
flanders
red
ive
tried
its
not
bad
i
guess
usually
i
find
sour
beers
too
sour
but
this
one
was
okay
probably
wont
have
again
though
i
love
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
all
night
sometimes
it
seems
a
bit
light
to
me
possibly
the
differing
meals
im
drinkng
it
with
but
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
oveall
balance
is
fantastic
i
like
the
level
of
sourness
for
an
everyday
beer
but
wouldnt
mind
more
sourness
on
occasion
possibly
the
rodenbach
grand
cru
will
accomplish
that
but
ive
not
been
able
to
hunt
that
down
yet
while
looking
i
wont
mind
drinking
this
one
possibly
even
daily
after
ironman
lake
placid
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
an
adequate
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
champagne
and
green
apples
cider
vinegar
a
little
sour
candy
in
there
too
very
interesting
brew
the
taste
is
pleasantly
sour
and
contains
hints
of
all
the
previously
mentioned
aromas
along
with
the
background
malt
slightly
watery
overall
its
good
but
just
doesnt
quite
flip
my
pancake
d
this
was
good
and
a
unique
brew
i
will
have
it
again
the
smell
kinda
turned
me
away
and
one
every
once
in
awhile
is
probably
good
enough
d
although
i
can
respect
where
this
is
coming
from
and
i
may
actually
buy
it
again
for
its
outstanding
complexity
and
uniqeness
i
would
not
care
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
is
out
of
the
question
due
to
the
tonguescathing
acidity
body
is
a
touch
thin
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
drinkability
so
refreshing
so
tasty
and
unique
highly
drinkable
poured
into
a
rodenbach
glass
a
very
deep
amber
with
a
very
nice
white
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
and
the
taste
is
all
about
tartness
and
dark
fuits
even
so
small
this
is
one
of
those
special
occasion
beers
not
an
everyday
kind
of
thing
even
though
it
is
fantastic
d
quite
easy
to
drink
light
in
body
abv
etc
has
a
fresh
clean
sweetsour
quality
that
makes
it
as
good
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
as
a
cool
one
a
nice
apertifdigestif
too
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
cherries
with
a
candy
sense
to
it
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
sweet
wine
with
some
malt
characteristics
an
interesting
blend
of
cherry
and
grape
flavor
with
a
slight
sweet
malt
presence
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
due
to
the
fruit
bitterness
the
bitterness
definitely
makes
this
one
a
sipper
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
but
nothing
id
seek
out
that
often
being
my
first
venture
with
this
style
wasnt
really
prepared
for
what
i
got
when
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
poured
a
slightly
reddish
brown
color
light
head
with
plenty
of
lacing
smelled
of
cherry
and
raspberry
with
a
back
note
of
vinegar
taste
comes
on
first
with
a
sour
vinegary
note
that
is
not
overpowering
but
definitely
lets
you
know
its
there
smooths
out
after
initial
taste
to
reveal
fruits
of
cherry
and
wood
tones
nice
pleasant
aftertaste
that
has
more
of
a
malt
characteristic
some
nice
carbonation
and
silky
mouth
feel
as
i
said
first
time
trying
this
style
but
wont
be
the
last
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
overall
this
was
one
of
my
first
ventures
into
the
style
and
i
loved
it
i
have
had
a
few
of
the
new
glarus
beers
made
with
souring
yeasts
and
this
was
atleast
as
good
as
them
i
liked
how
the
sourness
remained
balanced
and
let
the
other
flavors
shine
when
they
were
suposed
to
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
the
several
stages
in
flavor
lead
to
a
nice
complexity
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
will
again
soon
im
sure
overall
a
pretty
good
flanders
red
not
quite
up
there
with
the
duchess
de
bourgogne
but
certainly
recommended
pours
a
nice
homogeneous
shade
of
mahogany
decent
12
inch
fizzy
head
that
disperses
into
a
very
thin
ring
this
appears
to
be
light
and
crisp
with
a
very
winelike
oak
aroma
beyond
the
sour
tones
up
front
you
can
smell
a
light
sweetness
in
the
background
sour
cherries
raisins
and
grapes
the
taste
is
tart
up
front
with
a
flood
of
unripened
cherries
and
a
slight
tweak
of
malt
it
then
drops
off
slightly
into
a
very
mild
pure
carbonated
water
taste
very
strange
flavor
profile
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
it
yet
im
relatively
sure
that
this
isnt
my
kind
of
thing
i
have
tried
duchesse
de
bourgogne
a
while
back
not
knowing
that
it
was
a
flanders
red
ale
and
i
remember
it
having
a
more
full
flavor
and
more
continuously
rich
flavor
profile
this
one
sort
of
drops
off
in
such
an
abrupt
manor
not
enough
alcohol
for
the
oak
aging
to
really
do
much
for
imho
overall
i
was
glad
i
tried
more
than
one
of
this
style
for
relativity
if
nothing
else
quite
an
interesting
style
maybe
ill
try
the
grand
cru
in
a
couple
of
weeks
to
see
if
the
extra
alcohol
brings
something
better
to
the
table
beautiful
example
of
an
exceptional
style
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
beige
cap
thats
pretty
slim
dominant
vinous
nose
with
some
oak
and
a
slight
molasses
sweetness
dry
bitter
canvas
for
its
bold
flavor
of
fermented
berry
tartness
burnt
grains
displays
some
yeastiness
but
one
sided
could
have
used
more
depth
here
as
is
warms
fig
and
prune
notes
come
out
and
all
the
flavors
start
to
blend
together
for
a
smoother
balanced
flavor
finishes
dry
with
a
light
fruitiness
and
slight
tartness
full
body
and
an
even
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
low
but
exerts
just
enough
crispness
to
make
it
quite
enjoyable
the
beer
pours
a
dark
red
body
with
an
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
and
taste
go
hand
in
hand
with
a
sharp
sour
fruit
notes
that
are
quite
pleasant
the
carbonation
dances
on
the
touch
with
a
slight
cheek
puckering
sour
tartness
the
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
new
style
for
me
so
the
flavor
profile
was
a
little
unexpected
but
it
was
definitely
a
good
surprise
the
appearance
is
a
very
dark
red
brownish
color
and
there
was
very
little
head
with
a
gentle
pour
from
the
bottle
a
very
good
looking
beer
the
beer
smells
fruity
with
hints
of
apples
and
grapes
the
apple
and
grape
smells
follows
in
the
taste
which
is
fruity
with
the
hint
of
sour
for
which
this
style
is
named
the
sour
flavor
is
present
although
not
overpowering
or
unpleasant
in
any
way
this
lends
well
to
the
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
rereview

2
oz

abv
apparently
filtered
75
young
25
2
year
ive
found
that
the
flavor
now
is
quite
restrained
compared
to
my
prior
review
and
the
metal
flavor
is
quite
strong
interfering
with
the
enjoyability
of
the
beer
now
i
much
prefer
the
grand
cru
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
quite
light
id
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
3
of
these
which
would
give
me
a
pretty
bad
case
of
heartburn
the
current
rating
is
what
i
think
of
this
beer
as
of
this
review
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
exceptional
previous
problem
with
grand
cru
aleviated
with
acquisition
of
a
case
now
i
need
a
case
of
this
too
d
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
not
bad
at
all
my
first
taste
of
a
sour
ale
was
not
really
to
my
liking
but
this
has
intriqued
me
a
bit
more
this
was
much
much
better
i
actually
really
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
while
i
was
easting
dinner
and
has
opened
me
up
to
some
more
of
the
style
definalty
a
sipper
due
to
the
strongness
overall
definitely
an
interesting
brew
huge
sour
and
tart
notes
so
expect
over
the
top
worth
a
shot
if
for
nothing
but
curiousitys
sake
d
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
i
am
liking
it
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
starting
to
become
one
ill
look
for
every
now
and
then
drinkability
this
is
good
but
not
great
this
is
a
beer
that
is
put
together
pretty
well
its
worth
having
for
its
unique
character
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
deceptively
light
due
to
the
high
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
ehh
d
great
i
actually
ordered
two
of
these
in
a
row
because
they
were
so
good
i
wont
hesitate
to
have
this
again
poured
a
slightly
hazy
red
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
slowly
dropped
to
a
halfinch
and
stayed
aroma
was
crisply
sour
sour
milk
and
cherry
pungent
but
clean
taste
is
acidic
fruit
with
malty
undertones
and
a
chewy
finish
tastes
like
another
if
only
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
good
thus
far
the
highlight
of
my
beer
drinking
day
funk
yet
refined
this
was
a
great
beer
to
try
not
overwhelming
like
a
few
lambics
ive
tried
but
still
nothing
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
wood
character
was
evident
along
with
very
tart
cherries
grapes
and
apples
flavor
was
subdued
at
first
until
the
beer
warmed
up
reminds
me
of
la
folie
with
a
bit
more
fruit
but
not
as
rich
in
flavor
mouthfeel
was
very
zesty
at
the
beginning
and
smoothed
way
out
toward
the
end
as
it
warmed
medium
to
light
bodied
i
would
love
to
drink
this
one
again
in
the
future
appearance
more
brown
but
with
a
red
tinge
good
head
and
lacing
utterly
amazing
aromas
with
sour
cherries
and
chocolate
cherry
ripe
some
marzipan
in
there
as
well
to
taste
very
tart
and
sour
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
but
perfect
tingly
fine
carbonation
pours
a
dark
redbrown
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
very
fruity
taste
is
similar
very
fruity
with
a
sweet
taste
up
front
and
then
a
nice
sour
bite
thats
not
overwhelming
the
sourness
and
carbonation
provides
a
great
mouthfeel
and
feeling
on
your
tongue
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
makes
it
almost
like
a
sour
carbonated
wine
the
flaovr
is
pretty
rich
and
complex
malty
yet
not
to
heavy
just
enough
sweetness
to
off
set
the
sour
fruity
and
applilish
sour
and
sharp
but
not
over
the
edge
i
think
this
beer
would
go
well
with
a
good
beligian
mussles
while
this
beer
might
be
somewhat
harsh
on
its
own
it
is
a
nice
appetizing
beer
that
would
go
well
with
rich
creamy
cheeses
and
sourdough
bread
overall
this
is
very
very
easy
to
drink
especially
if
you
like
the
sour
styles
me
im
a
big
fan
of
flanders
red
berliner
weiss
etc
this
drinkability
however
comes
at
the
expense
of
character
after
all
water
is
pretty
high
on
the
drinkability
list
too
this
one
isnt
devoid
of
character
by
any
means
but
it
could
be
so
much
more
many
other
examples
of
intentionally
sour
beers
are
out
there
and
many
are
better
than
this
this
is
mild
enough
in
fact
that
id
say
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
others
to
the
style
before
moving
on
to
sour
brews
with
more
oomph
good
and
recommended
but
could
have
been
so
much
more
a
good
showing
for
a
flanders
red
and
if
youre
in
to
the
style
you
would
probably
love
it
avoid
if
you
arent
in
to
the
whole
sour
fruit
beer
scene
poured
out
a
dark
cranberry
color
with
thick
foamy
head
that
thins
out
quickly
but
laces
nicely
the
nose
smells
strongly
of
cider
with
caramel
and
spiciness
the
taste
has
an
initial
sour
apple
flavor
with
a
dryness
that
turns
into
sweet
caramel
maltiness
in
the
middle
it
finished
with
a
sour
cherry
like
taste
and
moderate
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
light
body
medium
carbonation
drinkability
wow
i
want
more
of
this
the
suprising
feature
of
this
beer
is
the
low
alcohol
content
this
makes
for
a
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
a
nice
steak
to
be
savored
over
the
meal
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
rodenbach
classic
is
a
disappointment
ive
come
to
enjoy
this
style
and
was
expecting
an
explosion
of
tart
funky
oakaccented
fruit
and
didnt
get
it
i
dont
remember
where
i
finally
located
a
bottle
but
from
now
on
whenever
i
get
the
urge
to
drink
a
beer
of
this
style
ill
be
content
with
the
monks
flemish
sour
red
that
i
can
get
mere
minutes
from
my
front
door
heres
hoping
that
rodenbach
grand
cru
blows
the
roof
off
the
joint
d
very
drinkable
quite
a
remarkable
drink
i
would
drink
one
glass
as
an
aperitif
i
couldnt
have
it
as
a
session
beer
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
there
is
a
much
more
earthy
flavor
coming
out
it
really
gets
woody
after
it
sits
for
a
while
after
you
have
been
sipping
this
beer
for
a
little
while
there
is
a
noticeable
acidity
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
throat
much
like
a
stout
beer
but
without
the
coffee
like
aftertaste
it
leaves
a
cherrylike
impression
to
linger
for
some
time
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
nice
to
have
a
beer
that
is
this
light
on
the
alcohol
yet
still
this
big
on
flavor
i
found
this
to
be
a
really
disappointing
beer
aroma
wasnt
bad
but
the
overwhelming
sourness
once
i
tasted
it
turned
me
right
off
reminded
me
of
drinking
apple
cider
and
had
apple
cider
vinegar
overtones
it
was
a
chore
to
drink
a
10
5
oz
glass
of
this
i
usually
keep
some
of
this
on
hand
in
my
cellar
and
im
always
glad
for
it
for
me
this
is
a
classic
a
really
unique
beer
one
of
my
favorite
comforting
beers
cheers
beertracker
try
if
you
want
to
experiment
not
for
all
tastes
drinkable
dont
get
me
wrong
but
in
limited
quantities
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
about
98
when
the
waitress
brought
me
one
when
i
had
ordered
a
st
rogue
red
i
tried
it
just
to
be
a
good
sport
but
sent
it
back
i
tried
it
again
over
the
next
few
years
and
hated
it
every
time
funny
now
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
was
excited
about
it
after
it
had
not
been
available
in
the
us
for
some
time
now
i
cant
wait
to
crack
open
my
grand
cru
notes
after
being
disappointed
with
a
bad
bottle
of
grand
cru
tasted
like
carbonated
vinegar
i
was
ever
so
pleased
with
this
beer
wonderful
flavors
with
a
great
level
of
tartness
i
will
get
this
beer
again
without
a
doubt
this
is
a
fine
sour
ale
i
consumed
the
750
with
no
effort
need
to
pick
up
another
one
of
these
ive
been
wanting
to
try
the
rodenbach
beers
for
quite
awhile
now
but
been
unable
to
find
em
yesterday
i
was
in
eugene
or
at
the
bier
stein
and
ran
across
some
much
to
my
delight
275
ml
bottle
poured
into
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
laced
up
fairly
quick
looks
great
smell
is
of
tart
cherries
oak
and
just
hint
of
vinegar
sour
twang
smells
awesome
taste
was
not
a
let
down
cherries
oak
rich
malts
hint
of
wheat
towards
the
end
with
a
pleasently
refreshing
sour
finish
mouthfeel
was
smooth
a
bit
sticky
and
tart
really
pleasent
man
if
i
could
get
this
stuff
in
town
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
i
absolutely
love
it
this
is
a
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
afternoon
to
refresh
you
or
as
a
dessert
for
after
dinner
big
downfall
is
appearance
which
is
a
murky
not
very
attrative
brown
however
it
does
pour
with
a
nice
head
which
maintains
as
a
purplish
ring
throughout
a
good
aperitif
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
doesnt
have
the
slightly
metallic
taste
that
some
others
in
the
style
show
the
beer
poured
a
lightly
hazed
deep
redbrown
the
head
started
out
about
an
inch
in
height
but
it
dissipated
pretty
quickly
like
a
glass
of
soda
but
left
some
spotty
wildly
patterned
fine
lacing
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
complex
and
intensely
dare
i
say
it
almost
intimdating
at
first
fairly
heavy
oak
tones
with
numerous
fruits
with
a
fairly
heavy
dose
of
a
tart
quality
to
it
the
flavor
itself
initially
is
a
subdued
oakedwoodiness
that
is
followed
by
the
substantial
lacticsourness
and
pocedes
to
multiple
layers
of
oakiness
as
the
flavor
itself
feels
like
it
spreads
outward
from
the
direct
center
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
its
dangerously
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
am
quite
surprised
that
something
of
this
quality
if
fairly
easy
to
come
across
here
in
town
although
dont
allow
my
surprise
to
be
anything
to
prevent
someone
from
trying
this
i
will
probably
return
soon
enough
pours
a

a
musty

aftertaste
is
tart

dry
with
a
funky

lingering

no
hops
to
speak
of
but
this
balances
fine
without

carbonation
and

accentuate
the
acidic
kick
and
produces

very
lively
mouthfeel
finishes
pleasently
tart
and
highly
drinkable
if
youre
youre
into
the
brett
thing
this
is
for
you
the
caramel
sweetness
took
a
lot
of
the
edge
off
this
one
and
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
last
swigs
tart

a
true
classic
very
crisp

refreshing
for
a
light
bodied
beer
this
has
an
exceptional
fullness
to
the
mouthfeel
without
being
oily
or
filmy
easily
sessionable
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
it
has
a
really
nice
tie
between
the
mouthfeel
complexity
of
tastes
and
drinkability
grab
this
one
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
it
is
an
excellent
value

the

of
getting
used

id
drink
this
again
cheers
this
beer
pours
deep
mahogany
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
nice
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
woody
and
sourtart
vinous
fruits
the
taste
reminds
me
first
of
a
gueze
or
a
lambic
but
not
quite
as
sourtart
there
is
also
a
slightly
preceptable
flavor
of
woodiness
the
mouthfeel
has
a
strong
body
without
being
overwhelming
the
carbonation
is
also
nice
there
is
also
a
nice
amount
of
dryness
overall
highly
drinkable
a
lovely
beer
a
great
one
to
mix
it
up
with
for
something
a
little
different
my
first
dive
into
sour
ales
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
tan
head
that
left
some
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
had
sour
vinegar
with
some
dark
fruits
and
a
sweeter
bubble
gum
like
scent
the
taste
is
wow
sour
i
know
i
should
have
expected
it
but
it
hit
me
hard
its
like
someone
stuffed
some
cherries
into
a
bottle
of
apple
cider
vinegar
this
may
be
true
to
style
but
its
not
for
me
i
gave
it
a
3
because
i
am
assuming
that
is
how
it
should
taste
well
it
was
an
interesting
experience
for
sure
but
i
had
to
feed
this
one
to
the
sink
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
the
beer
has
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
definate
thirst
quencher
i
will
definately
be
partaking
of
rodenbach
again
this
is
just
a
very
solid
sessionable
beer
pours
a
very
dark
red
color
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
tart
and
sour
cherries
taste
is
surprisingly
crisp
and
refreshing
sour
and
tart
fruit
dominate
the
taste
that
finishes
incredibly
dry
and
crisp
this
brew
has
an
extremely
high
drinkability
even
though
i
recommend
the
rodenbach
grand
cru
slightly
higher
this
is
an
absolutely
wonderful
brew
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
overall
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
beer
could
be
a
little
more
sour
im
glad
palm
started
importing
super
complex
refreshing
and
fun
not
more
than
one
glass
but
very
impressive
for
muggy
summer
evenings
forget
the
ipas
and
wheat
beers
this
is
the
one
very
refreshing
and
ridiculously
drinkable
i
am
beginning
to
love
these
sour
and
tart
beers
especially
in
the
warmer
weather
this
one
is
super
drinkable
quenching
and
enjoyable
i
will
be
back
to
this
throughout
the
summer
drinkability
unbelieveably
drinkable
you
just
want
to
keep
going
back
to
the
well
with
this
one
undeniably
a
stunning
example
of
the
style
worth
every
penny
and
a
beer
i
will
constantly
be
on
the
lookout
for
from
now
on
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
worth
trying
if
you
would
like
to
sample
a
flanders
red
ale
reddish
amber
color
with
a
foamy
collar
nice
color
but
the
head
isnt
super
its
got
a
sour
fruity
aroma
id
say
cranberry
is
the
fruit
i
detect
most
strongly
the
sour
character
is
even
more
distinct
than
the
aroma
the
fruit
is
less
distinct
than
in
the
grand
cru
which
i
prefer
but
this
is
nice
too
a
very
nice
example
of
a
flanders
red
ale
pours
from
the
growler
as
a
very
dark
brown
verging
on
red
color
there
is
a
brief
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
sour
thinking
apples
here
and
plesantly
so
the
taste
grows
on
you
with
each
sip
being
rather
sour
the
carbonation
brings
the
sour
taste
up
to
the
palate
very
nicely
a
good
brew
worth
giving
a
try
if
the
opportunity
presents
this
would
go
very
nicely
with
a
big
thanksgiving
meal
revolving
around
turkey
find
it
and
enjoy
drinkability

one
of
the
more
sessionable
sour
ales
that
ive
had
the
obvious
high
quality
of
the
ingredients
makes
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
the
25
ale
aged
in
oak
infusion
makes
this
a
smooth
drinker
this
ale
poured
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
was
tart
and
a
little
wild
with
some
lactic
overtones
the
aroma
faded
as
the
glass
sat
the
taste
was
tart
and
lactic
with
flavors
of
sour
cherries
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
there
was
mild
maltiness
beneath
the
tartness
and
a
faint
hint
of
cinnamon
or
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
tart
and
fruity
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
not
too
tart
and
leaving

qualities
but
definate
malt
presence
dry

not
as
big
as
the
grand

and
easier

carbonation
is
fairly
high
not
as
flavorful
rich
or
smooth
as
its
big
brother
but
those
lesser
qaulities
make
it
easier
drinking
and
still
a
tasty
beer
the
tame
version
of
its
big
brother
the
grand
cru
this
goldenbrown
beer
starts
off
with
a
distinctly
tart
aroma
that
includes
crabapple
bigtime
sweetsour
acidity
takes
hold
of
the
palate
its
like
drinking
sour
candy
wow
this
tartness
while
intense
stays
just
on
the
safe
side
of
mouthpuckering
i
think
this
was
my
first
flanders
red
ale
as
such
it
was
a
unique
and
eyeopening
experience
aftertaste
is
mildly
sour
with
some
woody
notes
stays
in
the
nose
for
minutes
afterwards
this
beer
is
probably
mild
enough
for
npeople
not
accustomed
to
flemish
reds
to
easily
drink
it
this
is
definitely
a
desert
island
beer
one
of
the
very
great
beers
one
should
always
have
around
yet
its
so
hard
to
find
in
parts
of
the
us
this
had
a
nice
winey
aroma
with
a
good
solid
head
when
poured
it
had
a
wonderful
sour
flavor
in
the
flemish
style
with
hints
of
black
cherries
i
also
taste
some
metallic
hints
but
did
not
detract
from
the
flavor
at
all
this
was
very
crisp
clean
in
the
finish
good
carbonation
led
this
to
be
very
drinkable
quenching
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
but
the
price
makes
it
slightly
prohibitive
it
pairs
well
with
a
wide
range
of
soft
buttery
andor
earthy
brietype
cheeses
and
alongside
a
crusty
loaf
of
whole
wheat
bread
it
makes
a
wonderful
small
meal
some
red
grapes
on
the
side
only
help
to
delineate
its
character
seafood
is
another
choice
to
consider
as
its
acidity
clearly
cuts
through
and
mussels
in
red
sauce
is
a
classic
finally
it
also
works
well
at
the
very
start
of
a
meal
as
an
apertif
or
with
salad
think
vinaigrette
and
soft
cheese
and
at
the
end
of
the
meal
as
a
palate
cleanser
d
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
style
and
it
is
very
interesting
the
tartness
is
very
intense
making
me
glad
that
i
tried
the
250
ml
bottles
instead
of
the
750s
as
i
think
a
750
would
be
difficult
to
finish
in
one
sitting
definitely
not
an
everyday
brew
but
definitely
one
that
ill
add
to
my
repertoire
i
think
a
few
of
these
would
be
welcome
but
certainly
not
a
session
beer
on
tap
at
mcnulty
bier
market
in
cleveland
pours
a
dark
red
ruby
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
disappeared
in
an
instant
slight
sour
cherry
and
vinegar
aroma
tart
flavor
of
sour
berries
flavor
ends
quickly
no
bitterness
quite
differnet
from
the
grand
cru
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
sour
light
to
medium
body
refreshing
and
pretty
drinkable
overall
im
really
impressed
this
is
one
of
those
unique
beer
gems
that
isnt
normal
and
is
all
the
more
amazing
for
it
we
wouldnt
want
everything
to
taste
the
same
would
we
poured
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
rodenbach
glass
picked
up
a
case
a
few
months
back
at
the
beeryard
and
have
been
trying
them
little
by
little
ever
since
just
has
this
one
tonight
the
beer
pours
a
deep
redish
brown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
with
some
good
lacing
the
aroma
gives
a
big
kick
of
cheeries
with
some
earthy
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
a
cluster
of
cherry
tartness
with
a
good
balance
of
carbonation
and
more
of
the
earthy
notes
i
got
in
the
aroma
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
although
not
my
favorite
flemish
red
it
is
very
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorites
seems
to
be
a
medium
bodied
brew
tartness
is
only
initial
and
then
subsides
a
bit
of
carbonation
adds
a
refreshing
edge
to
this
very
drinkable
for
the
style
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
good
drinkabilty
if
you
can
handle
the
intense
sweet
and
sour
tastes
gets
a
little
too
tart
to
have
too
many
d
i
can
really
see
how
this
style
is
nicknamed
the
red
wine
of
beers
im
just
not
a
big
fan

o
very
interesting
to
see
how
the
2yr
foederbier
provides
much
of
the
backbone
for
rodenbachs
grand
cru
especially
when
drinking
sidebyside
interesting
opportunity
to
try
this
in
the
states
with
the
brewmaster
no
less
thanks
adam
for
putting
the
event
together
toronado
san
francisco
ca
on
tap
at
the
beer
museum
in
bruges
interesting
to
try
the
beer
comes
together
so
well
in
the
bottled
versions
this
was
eh
for
such
a
rare
beer
it
is
quite
good
but
not
out
of
this
world
amazing
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
though
one
finger
thin
offwhite
head
quick
dissipation
leading
to
a
thin
broken
head
over
dark
ruby
red
body
minimal
carbonation
ala
cask
the
nose
is
fairly
sweet
cherries
balanced
by
a
slight
vinegar
aroma
and
pronounced
oak
tannins
present
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
an
attack
on
the
senses
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
rodenbach
big
oak
notes
even
more
than
grand
cru
really
not
that
sour
more
on
the
tart
side
mouthfeel
fairly
light
no
effervescence
to
speak
of
just
as
this
cask
beer
should
be
wow
what
a
special
treat
this
was
right
up
there
with
alexander
and
vin
de
cereale
rarer
than
hell
and
absolutely
worth
the
effort
to
try
and
find
not
as
acetic
as
many
other
examples
of
the
style
divine
o

aroma
musty

taste
almost
a

sensation
upon

vinegay
easy
finish
actually
rare
unique
intense
experience
not
fantastic
but
certainly
not
bad
either
an
interesting
experience
this
is
definitely
a
bit
burgundian
though
it
is
definitely
approaching
the
vinegar
side
of
the
spectrum
this
is
a
tasty
beer
to
be
sure
but
as
with
most
rodenbach
beers
these
days
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
maybe
the
best
beer
i
had
during
my
whole
trip
to
belgium
this
was
my
first
tasting
of
a
sour
beer
it
had
an
incredibly
tart
taste
a
berry
smell
it
was
like
a
sweettart
candy
but
without
the
sweet
part
if
that
makes
any
sense
dry
aftertaste
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
this
at
the
time
but
id
like
to
taste
it
again
now
that
i
have
some
more
appreciation
for
sour
beers
good
anyway
rgc
was
my
first
introduction
to
belgian
sours
nice
warm
honey
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
carbonated
head
vinegary
smooth
warm
sweet
bitter
sour
absolutely
love
this
beer
without
a
doubt
color
is
between
red
and
brown
nice
aroma
of
red
fruit
and
red
wine
taste
is
mixture
of
sour
and
sweet
and
is
a
bit
vinous
it
has
a
bit
more
character
than
a
regular
rodenbach
hence
the
slightly
higher
score
i
gave
it
my
palate
is
pretty
intrigued
by
this
flanders
red
ale
it
has
excellent
complexity
as
well
as
focused
and
controlled
intensity
much
in
the
same
way
theres
an
art
to
integrating
the
alcohol
of
high
strength
beers
into
their
flavor
seamlessly
i
think
this
ale
artfully
integrates
sourness
in
a
way
that
keeps
it
intense
yet
doesnt
overwhelm
excellent
stuff
here
not
sure
if
you
like
sours
give
this
one
a
whirl
highly
recommended
i
really
like
the
rodenbach
i
drink
it
like
they
give
you
the
option
in
belgium
with
a
little
bit
of
pomegranate
syrup
at
the
bottom
delicious
if
this
is
the
same
flemish
red
i
had
at
the
toronado
this
is
currently
my
favorite
beer
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
is
sweet
and
tart
and
has
lots
of
tart
fruitetc
flavor
yet
is
still
tastes
like
a
beer
at
only
9
a
750ml
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
toronado
san
francisco
ca
tart
fruity
lemonade
nose
with
light
barnyard
and
over
ripe
fruit
it
pours
brilliant
chestnut
with
cherry
highlights
and
a
very
dense
persistent
finely
bubbled
off
white
foam
cap
it
attacks
with
a
light
sweetness
and
then
the
tartness
explodes
with
unsweetened
lemon
plum
a
little
orange
and
dark
cherry
the
sweet
and
tart
oscilate
through
your
mouth
culminating
in
a
sweet
and
sour
finish
that
lingers
in
a
long
fruity
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
above
average
but
it
has
a
very
fine
bead
giving
the
beer
a
very
light
creamy
texture
its
not
for
mebut
not
bad
sour
but
not
hoppy
not
bad
overall
a
little
too
sweet
but
thats
stretching
for
a
complaint
very
dark
almost
prune
juice
like
grape
on
the
nose
with
red
wine
vinegar
grape
again
on
the
taste
with
a
little
vanilla
in
the
background
welchs
grape
soda
anyone
this
is
the
classic
flanders
red
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
with
a
very
clean
sour
finish
malt
and
sour
combine
to
a
great
complexity
this
would
have
received
5s
from
me
if
it
were
a
bit
more
sour
that
is
certainly
a
personal
preference
of
mine
overall
very
impressed
by
this
amazing
beer
reminds
me
of
monks
cafe
only
in
my
opinion
a
little
better
very
much
worth
the
price
of
11
for
750ml
my
wife
says
it
smells
like
hairspray
p
the
quintessential
sour
beer
must
buy
more
i
loved
this
beer
light
brown
thick
cream
color
head
light
on
taste
fruity
with
a
refined
finish
similar
to
a
fine
wine
overall
super
delicious
am
going
to
buy
again
and
also
try
other
versions
of
this
style
ale
verdict
a
staple
of
the
style
remarkably
balanced
and
well
rounded
the
complexity
is
there
though
it
feels
effortlessly
simple
to
drink
and
explore
it
hits
the
mark
for
anyone
who
loves
a
good
sour
especially
a
flanders
red
and
should
be
the
beer
that
all
others
get
compared
to
within
the
style
i
got
mostly
grape
notes
from
this
almost
like
a
tart
wine
the
sourness
is
sharp
but
it
finishes
very
clean
and
it
is
balanced
excellently
with
the
fruit
notes
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
dark
ruby
cast
above
normal
head
volume
good
lacing
and
retention
for
the
style
excellent
nose
of
slightly
sour
tart
raspberries
most
prevalent
and
cherries
over
a
light
caramel
sweetness
with
notes
of
oak
almost
light
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
texture
that
has
bursts
of
creaminess
in
the
finish
well
carbonated
with
effervescence
from
the
middle
on
the
flavor
profile
is
world
class
and
hits
the
marks
on
intensity
complexity
and
balance
it
begins
with
a
slightly
sweet
burst
of
raspberry
with
cherry
undertones
these
flavors
effervesce
into
a
nice
tartness
in
the
middle
with
just
a
touch
of
sourness
underneath
coupled
with
these
are
notes
of
oak
over
a
balancing
caramel
sweetness
as
these
progress
towards
the
finish
tartness
becomes
prevalent
and
a
mildly
sour
puckering
effect
sets
in
the
somewhat
dry
finish
is
a
fade
of
fruit
flavor
remnants
over
a
lingering
mildly
tart
sourness
o
a
lighter
flavorful
sour
a
good
everyday
option
my
new
favorite
beer
hands
down
this
is
the
best
sour
beer
that
ive
had
stocking
up
on
this
tomorrow
liquor
outlet
boonton
nj
great
brew
and
for
the
price
a
steal
almost
i
really
fell
for
this
beer
even
read
some
notes
on
the
style
prior
to
trying
it
looked
awesome
in
the
glass
with
the
deep
reddish
brown
hue
little
to
no
head
going
on
here
amazing
nose
including
the
vinegar
note
which
i
loved
for
some
reason
and
some
crazy
dark
fruit
medley
as
well
the
taste
was
unique
and
amazing
with
all
of
the
aroma
notes
joining
the
party
pucker
up
the
mouthfeel
was
very
dry
and
left
me
wanting
more
super
clean
and
original
damn
just
damn
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
bc
i
dont
enjoy
the
style
you
knew
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
resist
such
a
terrible
and
obvious
pun
shut
up
overall
i
love
sour
beers
and
its
really
difficult
to
find
fault
with
this
one
perfect
in
pretty
much
every
respect
although
some
might
find
the
slightly
vinegary
smell
a
bit
offputting
probably
not
the
ideal
starting
point
for
sour
ales
but
if
you
dont
try
it
youll
never
know
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
ever
since
i
heard
michael
jackson
talk
about
it
in
one
of
the
beer
hunter
episodes
and
and
additional
interview
it
does
not
disappoint
to
me
this
is
beers
answer
to
wine
its
very
vinous
and
tart
tastes
of
dark
fruits
and
cherry
only
a
bit
it
is
delicious
and
it
is
definitely
worth
your
time
hint
as
with
most
beer
have
it
colder
rather
than
warmer
enough
tart
to
let
you
know
youve
entered
sour
territory
but
balanced
and
flavorful
enough
to
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
by
the
acolyte
and
veteran
alike
rodenbach
grand
cru
is
my
goto
flanders
red
it
is
sour
funky
deliciousness
in
a
bottle
the
beer
is
also
an
unbelievable
bargain
and
can
be
found
for
1012
malt
bread
a
lot
of
cherries
very
ripe
full
of
flavor
perfect
chewy
tart
sourness
with
a
fruity

sweetness
decent
complexity
still
easy
drinkable
malt
underlines
the
cherries
till
the
end
holding
the
sourness
at
bay
great
balance
fruit
stays
in
the
foreground
the
whole
time
resulting
in
a
chewy
sour
aftertaste
body
is

carbonation

beer
4
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
one
sweet
sour
totally
addictive
leaves
you
wanting
more
every
time
o
this
is
an
example
of
sour
ale
at
its
best
tight
but
complex
light
yet
satisfying
and
again
very
very
refreshing
fantastic
blend
wellbalanced
would
drink
this
any
time
anywhere
overall
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
im
a
bit
new
to
sour
beers
in
general
so
i
was
taken
aback
initially
by
the
sourspoiled
fruit
character
but
after
the
first
few
sips
or
so
it
just
got
more
complex
more
interesting
and
more
delicious
until
the
entire
750ml
bottle
was
gone
what
a
kickass
beer
these
belgians
really
know
what
theyre
doing
o
i
have
not
had
this
beer
in
about
9
months
so
i
was
a
little
anxious
to
see
if
it
would
be
as
impressive
as
i
remember
it
being
after
drinking
many
new
beers
it
is
its
hard
to
say
if
id
change
anything
about
it
id
perhaps
opt
for
a
darker
vanilla
head
accompanied
by
a
little
more
funk
and
sweetness
on
the
nose
tastewise
perhaps
a
little
more
funkiness
and
weirdness
id
love
to
try
this
beer
at
1012
just
to
see
what
the
additional
viscosity
could
do
for
the
mouthfeel
although
its
already
superb
a
must
try
tastes
as
much
of
fruit
as
of
beer
a
sour
apple
dum
dum
is
not
a
bad
comparison
pours
out
brown
as
a
bottle
2
0
puckers
out
of
a
possible
5
overall
very
refreshing
not
too
heavy
not
too
sour
not
too
fizzy
and
big
on
flavour
a
bit
of
a
cherry
brandyport
influence
going
on
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
red
color
with
a
bubbly
reddish
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
noseahhh
the
nose
is
just
wonderful
lots
of
toasted
malt
ripe
fruit
sweetness
cherries
hints
of
oak
some
subtle
acidity
leather
and
whispers
of
some
tart
barniness
the
taste
is
equally
complex
and
yet
so
drinkable
really
pronounced
red
fruit
cherries
but
some
deeper
ripeness
in
the
form
of
raisins
some
toasted
malt
and
caramel
white
pepper
leather
oak
the
body
is
full
and
round
yet
light
on
the
tongue
with
lots
of
carbonation
but
in
no
way
overcarbed
wow
this
is
just
a
fantastic
complex
subtle
yet
highly
drinkable
beer
truly
delicious
overall
definitely
the
best
sour
beer
i
have
had
to
date
lots
of
complexity
and
an
fantastic
smoothyetsharp
mouth
feel
make
this
one
a
must
have
even
at
a
price
of
au130
for
24
x
330ml
maybe
one
every
now
and
then
as
a
treat
apple
front
with
a
cherry
finish
great
sour
overall
a
wonderful
drinkable
exciting
beer
that
makes
you
crave
each
sip
it
is
sour
but
a
slight
sweetness
balances
the
palette
o
what
an
absolute
delight
of
a
beer
its
sour
fruity
tasty
and
refreshing
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
and
ill
definitely
have
this
again
in
the
future
if
i
ever
see
it
o
probably
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
certainly
my
favorite
of
this
style
i
have
been
fortunate
to
try
some
of
the
vintage
examples
from
rodenbach
which
are
worth
the
effort
to
obtain
pours
a
brilliant
amber
with
red
highlights
and
a
lingering
frothy
khaki
head
aroma
is
laden
with
balsamic
vinegar
and
oak
tart
cherry
surfaces
late
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
but
the
balsamic
vinegar
acetic
notes
counter
to
balance
cherry
notes
mingle
with
oak
and
somehow
theres
an
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
not
as
tart
as
some
but
very
characterful
its
sweeter
than
i
recall
o
i
understand
why
people
call
this
the
best
shelf
sour
you
can
buy
would
buy
cases
of
this
stuff
next
time
i
see
it
an
absolute
gem
and
a
mustdrink
for
any
beer
connoisseur
no
question
why
this
beer
is
renowned
its
great
across
the
board
nothing
bad
and
a
whole
lot
good
deliciously
tart
with
just
the
right
amount
of
fruit
to
complement
it
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
o
a
pleasant
sour
highly
drinkable
and
recommended
well
made
o
expensive
and
rated
high
certainly
unique
my
first
of
this
type
not
sure
what
to
pair
it
with
some
lighter
cheeses
perhaps
even
blue
cheese
would
go
well
sharp
cheeses
like
cheddar
sour
fruits
like
cherries
or
raspberries
medium
to
light
body
with
medium
to
light
carbonation
actually
good
at
room
temperature
its
a
very
aquired
taste
and
needs
to
be
considered
when
to
drink
this
beer
black
chunky
floaties
near
the
bottom
pours
a
nice
red
beer
able
to
see
through
not
many
bubbles
forming
aroma
is
good
like
lambics
or
gueuzes
and
you
can
smell
the
sour
nature
of
the
beer
taste
is
good
sour
yet
sweet
it
is
not
a
straightforward
sour
it
is
more
of
a
cherry
lambic
but
very
light
mouth
feel
is
also
light
if
youre
afraid
of
sours
as
i
am
treat
yourself
to
this
youll
probably
like
it
more
than
you
imagine
o
great
sour
not
over
the
top
but
good
will
buy
again
i
prefer
the
regular
rodenbach
its
in
the
middle
between
bitter
and
sour
slightly
sweet
although
this
one
has
a
great
color
it
smells
like
wood
like
it
has
been
in
a
casket
for
a
long
time
it
has
an
aged
aroma
high
carbonation
the
sour
wall
hits
you
in
the
face
there
is
not
much
flavor
other
than
sour
no
wood
flavor
not
really
beer
flavor
this
should
be
classified
as
a
spirit
hard
lemonade
o
for
fans
of
the
sour
that
gravitate
to
the
sweet
and
sour
side
of
things
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
example
of
the
flanders
style
not
too
tart
not
too
sweet
right
on
the
mark
excellent
beer
overall
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
although
bottled
is
also
very
good
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
get
someone
started
in
sours
if
theyve
never
had
one
before
moving
on
to
some
really
funky
stuff
will
have
again
i
had
planned
to
add
a
disclaimer
that
a
4
9
or
something
here
should
not
be
construed
to
mean
i
like
rgc
any
less
than
those
ive
had
at
5
turned
out
not
to
matter
i
can
find
no
nits
to
pick
this
is
a
perfect
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
tight
white
bubbles
on
top
and
impressive
lacing
i
get
young
grapes
straight
away
on
the
nose
followed
by
apple
pulp
a
bready
character
and
a
bit
of
oak
from
the
barrels
this
one
starts
out
really
sour
with
a
lemon
taste
but
soon
becomes
much
sweeter
with
a
big
red
grape
presence
there
are
slight
notes
of
bread
and
vanilla
but
the
grape
taste
dominates
it
gets
a
more
puckering
again
on
the
finish
with
a
green
apple
skin
tanginess
the
whole
thing
is
pretty
well
carbonated
and
its
as
light
dry
and
easydrinking
as
champagne
rodenbach
grand
cru
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
a
pronounced
sour
aroma
with
wine
like
notes
and
subtle
oak
notes
the
taste
has
a
nice
noticeable
sour
flavor
with
a
sweeter
aftertaste
with
hints
of
a
earthy
oak
great
feel
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
sour
taste
is
smooth
with
plenty
of
tartness
and
sweet
notes
quite
winelike
in
tone
definitely
plenty
of
berries
in
there
cherries
maybe
and
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
and
wild
yeast
are
also
detectable
this
ones
like
a
melding
of
a
saison
and
a
sour
ale
very
good
and
very
complex
here
enjoyed
this
one
for
sure
o
really
great
all
around
but
i
wasnt
prepared
to
tackle
the
bomber
myself
the
sweettartness
just
gets
to
be
too
much
for
me
with
this
style
ideal
serving
size
is
probably
about
10
oz
a
delicious
sour
cherry
beer
that
is
bubbly
and
refreshing
receives
a
5
from
me
due
to
the
fact
that
this
is
the
pinnacle
for
the
style
this
beer
is
what
all
other
flanders
reds
should
aspire
to
be
a
true
classic
o
this
beer
has
an
odd
palatecleansing
sensation
that
amazed
me
not
too
sour
nor
a
fruit
punch
with
is
refreshing
in
its
own
right
o
meaty
sours
are
hard
to
come
by
duchesse
de
bourgogne
is
the
only
one
that
comes
to
mind
so
this
is
something
of
a
treat
for
sour
lovers
though
not
exactly
my
favorite
take
on
the
flanders
red
style
this
beer
is
unforgettably
unique
and
would
make
for
a
great
dinner
beer
i
could
see
it
pairing
with
countless
dishes
again
cuvee
de
jacobin
the
complexity
of
this
beer
wins
it
out
for
but
both
are
world
class
o
mildly
tart
nicely
balanced
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
ever
had
very
drinkable
nice
berry
and
stonefruit
fruitiness
simple
but
balanced
and
very
tasty
i
have
to
thank
my
friend
paul
for
sharing
this
with
us
what
a
legend
thanks
man
killer
beer
of
fame
here
not
sure
i
would
ever
find
one
but
sure
enough
not
quite
a
flanders
red
to
me
not
quite
an
oud
bruin
but
some
dynamic
synergy
of
both
greater
than
either
and
about
as
complex
as
beer
can
get
just
so
much
going
on
in
this
one
hazy
very
dark
amber
color
as
much
brown
as
red
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
doesnt
fade
at
all
it
smells
like
nutty
grain
on
the
front
end
but
carries
with
it
a
palate
watering
acidity
and
tartness
thats
short
of
fully
sour
but
lactic
and
enticing
the
first
part
of
the
sip
is
malt
heavy
its
sweet
brown
sugar
and
candied
red
grain
but
it
moves
swiftly
into
a
whole
mouth
experience
that
draws
unusual
connections
between
acidity
oak
and
earthy
grain
the
sweetness
doesnt
last
at
all
and
the
tartness
that
replaces
it
is
both
surprising
and
welcomed
even
after
the
swallow
i
taste
this
for
miles
some
preserved
lemon
vinegar
as
it
dies
out
but
i
am
amazed
by
all
the
layers
here
massive
body
but
i
like
that
the
alcohol
is
so
manageable
so
many
of
these
get
too
enormous
for
much
drinking
but
this
stays
right
in
the
comfortable
range
as
much
flavor
as
ive
seen
in
a
beer
at
6
abv
enough
carbonation
i
wouldnt
call
it
lively
but
its
not
flat
either
somewhere
in
the
upper
medium
range
which
is
a
nice
compliment
to
the
complexity
i
wish
this
came
to
colorado
thanks
again
paul
for
sharing
such
a
high
end
and
unique
beverage
overall
nice
tart
sour
ale
very
grape
soda
like
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
too
much
like
drinking
grape
soda
for
10
a
750ml
bottle
that
is
yearround
i
daresay
it
doesnt
get
better
than
this
so
many
flavors
combined
with
a
predominantly
soft
and
creamy
wood
aged
texture
as
well
as
delightful
fruit
and
winelike
notes
this
is
a
world
class
flanders
red
it
wont
kick
the
crap
out
of
you
but
its
profile
to
be
extra
flavorful
and
yet
so
easy
to
drink
as
well
as
easily
pair
with
food
should
be
noted
want
to
turn
wineonly
drinkers
on
to
beer
this
is
the
one
a
unique
brew
in
a
class
of
its
own
looks
good
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
great
very
sour
and
fruity
plenty
of
vinegar
notes
the
only
aspect
im
not
sure
about
is
the
oxidation
i
cant
tell
if
this
would
be
present
in
a
fresher
bottle
lovely
body
that
tantalises
the
tongue
an
intriguing
drinking
experience
and
one
that
i
must
repeat
and
possibly
rereview
well
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
finally
got
to
try
this
classic
and
it
did
not
disappoint
poured
a
reddish
brown
body
with
one
finger
a
head
on
top
of
an
aroma
of
a
lot
sour
and
funky
fruits
mainly
a
tart
cherry
aroma
a
touch
of
wood
andor
winelike
qualities
and
a
a
touch
of
sweetness
beer
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
and
not
as
sourfunky
as
it
smells
the
sourtart
cherry
aspect
is
aplenty
but
there
is
a
great
balance
of
sweetness
whether
it
be
candi
sugar
or
fruit
derived
and
the
funk
aspect
is
minimal
so
its
not
a
overpowering
puckering
sourness
or
tartness
but
just
hits
the
right
spot
great
carbonation
so
beer
is
lively
and
finishes
real
crisp
just
a
great
beer
to
sip
with
after
dinner
o
this
is
my
favorite
ale
i
started
drinking
it
in
january
2014
and
i
havent
been
able
to
stop
i
really
love
the
taste
of
vinegar
so
i
really
enjoy
that
aspect
of
this
beer
with
that
being
said
i
imagine
that
for
some
this
taste
could
be
overwhelming
or
even
unpleasant
i
really
love
this
beer
overall
a
good
beer
and
much
like
duchesse
it
is
reputedly
a
benchmark
for
the
flanders
red
style
admittedly
my
favorite
flanders
red
was
bordering
more
on
kriek
territory
with
a
teeth
enamelmelting
sourness
to
it
so
perhaps
this
style
isnt
my
favorite
in
the
world
i
am
curious
enough
about
aging
it
to
go
get
a
second
bottle
so
that
i
can
sit
on
it
until
closer
to
the
drink
by
date
prost
o
this
is
only
my
second
tart
beer
1st
cuvée
freddy
sour
beers
are
such
a
shock
to
my
taste
buds
and
mind
that
i
cant
even
say
with
conviction
that
i
like
the
taste
its
unique
and
i
dont
hate
it
o
an
excellent
tart
beer
the
oak
flavor
really
plays
well
with
the
tart
fruits
appearance
is
brown
in
color
supporting
a
crisp
dissipating
head
smell
of
prominant
fruity
sour
with
some
wild
yeast
and
oaky
aromas
taste
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
with
the
yeast
and
woody
oak
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
not
much
on
sours
but
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
tried
the
king
of
the
flanders
reds
perhaps
there
could
very
well
be
better
tasting
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
this
one
is
widely
available
and
a
relatively
recent
arrival
to
alberta
a
russet
reddish
to
brown
color
with
around
three
inches
of
tan
head
comprised
of
noticeably
small
bubbles
aroma
is
that
of
red
wine
vinegar
grape
candy
tart
cherry
juice
red
berries
and
lemon
very
sour
and
makes
the
nose
tingle
in
a
good
way
i
also
get
some
light
earthy
malt
beneath
the
sour
assault
taste
is
dry
sour
woody
fruity
carbolic
and
sour
complex
and
somehow
manages
to
juggle
a
bright
intense
fruitiness
with
a
strong
sourness
such
that
neither
component
gets
trumped
or
dominated
by
the
other
tastes
like
dilute
balsamic
vinegar
sour
pie
cherries
lemon
tamarind
raspberry
nectarine
and
tea
leaf
but
there
are
also
some
light
sultana
raisin
and
brown
sugar
notes
in
the
background
puckerinducing
to
my
palate
the
abv
does
put
in
a
brief
appearance
here
and
there
body
quite
thin
with
a
moderate
to
high
degree
of
carbonation
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
chokecherries
you
could
snack
on
in
the
northern
saskatchewan
bush
if
you
were
so
inclined
albeit
much
much
tastier
i
am
tempted
to
introduce
this
beer
to
a
few
wine
snobs
i
know
omy
first
of
this
beer
style
and
i
was
not
disappointed
great
beer
notes
a
fantastic
beer
that
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
champagne
due
to
the
carbonic
bite
and
sweetness
you
can
definitely
smell
the
barrel
in
this
beer
id
like
to
try
it
directly
from
the
finishing
tank
rodenbach
was
my
revelation
beer
in
2013
and
grand
cru
is
more
of
the
same
this
is
an
excellent
beer
across
the
board
for
someone
who
truly
appreciates
the
complexities
of
the
style
to
a
complete
novice
in
wildtype
ales
dark
even
very
rich
appearance
little
or
no
head
pleasantly
sour
as
described
on
the
establishments
beer
list
minus
the
term
pleasantly
to
my
disappointment
it
was
the
only
sour
on
tap
from
which
i
can
gather
that
my
taste
buds
have
rare
company
orand
its
just
not
a
popular
taste
im
fine
with
that
o
glad
i
found
this
one
for
such
a
cheap
price
i
wanted
to
buy
it
earlier
but
it
costs
over
20
at
the
local
store
found
it
for
10
this
is
an
awesome
flanders
red
ale
and
reminds
me
of
jacobins
rouge
it
comes
in
a
huge
bottle
as
well
so
that
you
can
enjoy
it
for
a
long
period
this
is
very
good
very
tasty
and
nice
all
around
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
seems
to
be
holding
out
the
real
strength
that
lies
within
o
a
near
perfect
flanders
red
having
it
on
tap
is
a
surprise
for
me
i
have
never
seen
it
anywhere
else
than
my
local
bottle
shop
o
the
fruity
flavors
that
come
from
this
beer
are
amazing
considering
there
is
no
fruit
used
to
make
it
a
fine
beer
great
beer
great
brewery
exceptional
the
best
sour
ale
i
have
had
thus
far
truly
fantastic
balance
of
flavors
and
aromas
and
a
delicate
body
a
musttry
for
fans
of
sours
how
on
this
world
have
i
not
reviewed
this
im
sure
ive
tasted
this
before
but
after
seeing
no
rating
from
me
my
memory
is
asking
the
question
have
i
ever
tried
it
and
after
a
2litre
growler
purchase
ill
be
sure
and
on
popping
it
pours
a
cherry
red
hue
with
a
creamy
off
white
two
finger
head
and
clingy
lacing
everywhere
a
beautiful
looking
redthe
smell
is
mustyfunkyslight
oak
and
red
grapes
and
highly
approachablethe
mouthfeel
is
borderlining
on
perfection
its
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
like
most
have
said
before
the
taste
of
this
flanders
is
one
for
the
non
believers
of
this
crazy
beautiful
style
and
its
red
grapesbeautiful
funkcherries
and
the
finish
is
sour
tart
and
bloody
refreshing
and
overall
now
im
confident
ive
tried
this
and
the
2lt
purchase
was
a
great
choice
by
me
as
its
not
on
your
face
like
most
of
this
style
and
a
great
step
in
flanders
territory
for
virgins
of
the
style
and
even
veterans
like
me
cheers
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
showed
me
i
might
end
up
liking
some
sours
its
quite
tasty
the
grand
cru
pours
a
very
dark
and
murky
redbrown
with
a
think
light
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
thin
frothy
top
the
smell
is
sour
and
tart
like
sour
cherries
and
rotting
pears
there
are
also
elements
of
yeasty
maybe
baking
bread
scents
the
taste
starts
with
a
punch
of
tartness
and
flows
into
sweet
cherry
flavors
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
rich
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
low
end
of
being
medium
bodied
and
very
silky
and
smooth
i
love
this
beer
its
very
nice
and
as
far
as
on
style
i
think
this
is
the
benchmark
that
i
judge
all
other
flanders
red
ales
by
d
really
good
stuff
dangerously
drinkable
tart
but
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
really
well
balanced
and
complex
this
is
a
such
a
unique
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
it
this
one
is
a
classic
for
a
reason
o
not
particularly
enjoyable
sour
on
the
watery
side
for
a
dark
beer
it
feels
like
theres
just
something
missing
ive
heard
it
compared
to
champagne
and
i
guess
if
you
want
a
beer
glass
of
middling
champagne
this
works
o
an
outstanding
sour
from
rodenbach
great
puckering
pour
in
a
good
way
letting
the
sweetsourtart
cherry
dominate
the
palate
im
loving
this
one
and
considering
its
4
a
bottle
i
might
go
stock
up
another
great
addition
to
the
shelves
here
in
alberta
an
easy
recommendation
rerated
this
beer
on
2815
11
99
from
arrow
wine
amazing
beer
at
price
point
of
89
clams
i
will
snag
this
anytime
i
see
it
a
benchmark
for
this
style
as
others
have
mentioned
so
overall
as
a
beer
this
is
very
solid
as
its
a
bridge
i
feel
between
an
acquired
style
not
one
that
i
necessarily
have
and
a
standard
beer
as
i
said
above
a
mildly
adventurous
beer
drinker
should
try
this
to
see
where
they
might
want
to
experiment
next
amazing
representation
of
the
style
flemish
red
at
its
best
its
sour
just
enough
but
not
overpowering
smells
and
tastes
like
fresh
juicy
cherries
rubyred
color
and
a
perfect
head
some
oak
is
present
and
woodiness
is
mixed
with
the
fruit
taste
for
sure
grand
cru
is
more
refined
than
the
regular
rodenbach
and
for
some
reason
i
keep
finding
it
cheaper
cheers
to
that
o
very
nice
beer
very
tart
and
sour
but
complex
and
not
overpowering
i
am
surprised
at
how
much
wood
cuts
through
the
tartness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
reviewed
52608
overall
just
an
excellent
flemish
red
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
expected
and
more
carbonated
than
other
great
sours
o
highly
refreshing
when
drunk
cooled
the
sourness
is
pronounced
an
excellent
beer
a
testament
to
what
beer
can
be
such
a
unique
style
done
to
near
perfection
you
dont
get
this
combination
of
flavors
in
any
other
style
the
complexity
is
outstanding
and
the
balance
of
sour
to
sweetness
is
amazing
whether
youre
new
to
craft
beer
or
a
seasoned
veteran
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
you
need
to
seek
it
out
overall
my
secondfavorite
sour
after
cuvee
des
jacobins
but
a
little
easier
to
find
admittedly
less
tart
and
better
balanced
this
is
usually
the
one
ill
order
for
friends
when
introducing
them
to
the
style
o
overall
i
want
to
state
im
not
huge
into
sours
but
this
was
great
maybe
the
best
i
have
had
yet
will
buy
this
one
again
when
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
o
quite
easy
drinking
not
overpowering
in
any
respect
fine
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
complex
this
is
the
classic
it
defines
the
genre
it
is
earthy
fruity
tart
oaky
spritzy
and
everything
is
in
balance
what
a
great
beer
year
after
year
after
year
this
is
a
great
beer
a
perfect
introduction
to
sours
for
most
anyone
overall
for
a
shelf
beer
at
12
a
bottle
this
is
a
fantastic
option
for
anytime
very
fruit
forward
so
you
have
to
like
fruity
beers
but
this
one
isnt
too
sweet
or
overpowering
if
it
had
a
bit
more
oakiness
and
more
sourtart
to
it
it
could

but
its
still
a
great
beer
and
even
greater
considering
it
sits
on
shelves
if
you
are
in
need
of
a
sour
power
day
and
dont
want
to
raid

first
sip
sweet
a
little
sour
very
complex
some
cherry
up
front
but
quickly
turns
less
fruity
than
the
fresh
bottle
earlier
had
been
the
age
makes
it
smoother
than
the
fresh
bottle
the
sour
component
is
preceded
by
a
dark
brown
sugary
malt
that
is
quite
sweet
and
just
the
right
offset
for
the
sour
the
long
finish
makes
it
easy
to
sip
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
sour
beers
but
this
is
delicious
overall
impression
a
beer
with
amazing
complexity
and
depth
deftly
skirts
the
line
between
beer
and
red
wine
sour
and
sweet
and
biting
and
smooth
best
described
as
a
beer
dressed
up
as
a
red
wine
with
a
sour
kick
o
its
nearly
room
temperature
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
and
its
still
fantastic
tons
of
flavor
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
oa
very
solid
ale
and
a
bargain
for
this
style
and
readily
available
nice
balance
between
the
sweeter
and
sour
aspects
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
for
the
style
thin
bordering
on
medium
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
carbonation
in
my
bottle
could
have
been
higher
there
isnt
much
more
that
i
can
say
about
this
beer
other
than
the
fact
that
it
exceeded
any
and
all
expectations
i
had
im
a
big
fan
of
sour
beers
and
i
sure
do
love
my
american
wild
ales
that
stretch
the
palate
towards
unobtainable
levels
of
tartness
but
this
beer
proves
that
you
can
be
both
sour
and
complex
and
when
done
properly
its
a
wonderful
thing
to
behold
the
fact
that
its
fairly
readily
available
may
be
the
biggest
wonder
of
them
all
overall
quality
all
around
nothing
that
stands
out
but
a
great
all
around
flanders
red
overall
excellent
sour
very
tasty
and
refreshing
its
not
too
sweet
not
too
sour
but
everything
is
put
together
just
right
to
make
it
a
nice
sipper
on
a
summer
or
winter
evening
whatever
season
it
is
its
a
versatile
sour
beer
that
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
sours
due
to
it
being
balanced
and
not
too
over
the
top
and
the
price
is
right
for
a
barrelaged
belgian
sour
812
for
a
750ml
is
a
great
deal

yep
this
taste
is
pretty
incredible
lots
of
fruit
presence
as
in
the
nose
with
some
dark
cherry
and
slightly
tangy
cherry
flesh
flavor
with
a
nice
amount
of
malt
and
yeast
adds
that
lactic
tang
with
a
nice
wood
flavor
rounding
out
this
fine
flemish
red
overall
i
have
had
this
on
a
few
occassions
and
it
really
is
a
treat
i
was
glad
i
could
enjoy
a
750ml
myself
but
the
acid
was
a
little
strong
as
it
warmed
for
me
a
highly
drinkable
belgian
well
worth
having
multiples
of
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
flanders
reds
ive
had
right
up
there
with
cuvee
des
jacobins
this
hits
the
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
so
layered
and
complex
i
can
hardly
believe
this
is
just
water
barley
hops
and
assorted
bugs
there
are
just
so
many
fruit
flavors
here
and
the
added
vanillabarrel
character
just
brings
it
to
that
next
level
the
best
part
is
its
widely
available
and
cheap
relative
to
the
style
i
could
drink
this
every
day
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sours
and
havent
tried
this
one
you
need
to
if
you
are
wondering
about
trying
a
sour
beer
this
is
a
great
place
to
start
cheers
some
flanders
red
ales
come
almost
comically
close
to
being
balsamic
vinegar
with
alcohol
but
this
one
is
amazing
and
balanced
the
nose
belies
a
redfruit
sweetness
hinting
at
figs
and
cherries
with
a
hint
of
plum
and
when
you
taste
you
get
what
you
came
for
sometimes
you
want
that
balsamic
vinegar
thing
and
i
feel
this
beer
has
enough
tartness
and
sweetness
to
at
least
satisfy
that
desire
without
being
an
overpowering
note
very
wellblended
beer
a
delight
to
drink
without
being
scary
for
the
unprepared
my
first
flanders
red
was
way
heavier
than
this
and
mightve
scared
me
away
from
the
style
all
around
enjoyable
offering
from
rodenbach
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
this
is
my
first
brew
of
the
sours
category
flanders
red
in
this
case
and
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
outcome
and
with
this
price
tag
it
is
a
must
get
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
red
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
hardly
any
lacing
and
retention
on
this
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
slightly
sour
with
notes
of
oak
and
cherry
the
taste
is
really
nice
its
got
a
subtle
tart
cherry
flavor
with
a
slight
sweet
malt
backbone
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
solid
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
would
drink
it
again
anytime
o
really
good
ages
well
not
too
sweet
one
of
the
best
in
style
for
sure
i
recieved
this
as
part
of
the
sours
for
dummies
bif
poured
from
a
750
into
a
tulip
pours
murky
brown
with
a
big
white
head
lots
of
cherries
balsamic
vinegar
on
the
nose
the
flavors
blend
nicely
cherries
oak
lactic
acid
the
beer
is
slightly
drying
good
carbonation
refreshing
a
great
beer
exceptional
flanders
o
an
excellent
sour
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
what
sour
beer
can
be
it
is
well
balanced
with
a
wonderful
acidity
i
like
the
earthiness
as
well
o
wow
this
kicks
ass
on
the
right
kind
of
day
lets
say
perfectly
sunny
80f
sitting
on
a
patio
id
have
no
trouble
crushing
multiple
750ml
bottles
of
this
left
and
right
beautiful
stuff
this
one
orodenbach
grand
cru
has
become
a
standby
for
me
unbelievably
complex
i
always
have
some
ready
to
serve
its
inexpensive
readily
available
and
far
and
away
the
best
flanders
red
alesour
i
have
had
very
pleasant
beer
for
the
style
i
love
good
acidity
in
a
flanders
and
this
one
doesnt
fall
into
the
trap
of
being
a
vinegar
bomb
like
most
the
sourness
is
noticable
and
pleasant
yet
restrained
as
hearty
as
everything
comes
and
as
thoroughly
as
things
express
themselves
there
is
a
very
bearable
lightness
in
their
collective
being
an
evanescence
somehow
pervades
even
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
that
dark
beauty
amy
lee
dammit
this
shit
just
turns
out
to
be
so
drinkable
because
of
this
there
are
worse
burdens
i
spose
its
just
so
drinkable
and
tasty
get
it
now
if
you
like
the
style
you
will
love
this
its
damn
near
perfect
and
a
guaranteed
palate
pleaser
o
dark
and
fruity
with
a
strong
wood
impact
not
overly
sweet
well
balanced
o
overall
this
beer
is
not
quite
as
tartsour
as
one
might
think
from
an
initial
sniff
making
a
little
more
approachable
for
people
that
are
new
to
the
style
the
beer
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
lower
abv
and
not
too
intense
flavors
the
grand
cru
displays
an
elegant
dark
red
body
with
a
slightly
tanned
head
and
carries
a
wellbalanced
aroma
with
caramelized
malts
and
discrete
hops
the
taste
has
a
carbonated
and
refreshing
acidity
wellharmonized
with
the
hops
the
aftertaste
retains
a
little
bit
of
the
acidity
reminding
you
that
you
just
had
an
excellent
beer
this
was
delicious
i
was
excited
to
have
found
it
on
tap
it
has
a
tremendous
flavor
that
is
complex
yet
drinkable
the
tartness
isnt
overpowering
either
which
helps
the
drinkability
this
is
not
a
style
i
typically
go
for
but
when
i
saw
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
jumped
at
it
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
it
was
very
enjoyable
o
great
complex
yeasty
fruit
flavors
nice
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
anxious
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
jacobins
rogue
cheers
dark
pour
with
a
khaki
head
smells
very
tart
with
some
hay
and
earthiness
tastes
impressively
smooth
with
heavy
notes
of
cherries
sour
cherry
with
some
bitterness
to
balance
very
nice
would
definitely
drink
this
again
and
regularly
if
possible
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
ive
never
been
huge
on
sour
ales
but
this
is
a
desert
island
beer
the
tanginess
leaves
you
feeling
more
thirsty
wanting
more
with
each
sip
clearish
deep
ruddy
chestnut
topped
with
a
slender
bubbly
cap
tart
cherry
acetone
caramel
malt
mustiness
and
some
roast
in
the
nose
juicy
cherry
tartness
oak
dark
fruit
and
malt
flavor
super
slick
very
dry
tart
and
quite
refreshing
very
nice
o
awesome
o
this
was
my
first
take
on
a
flanders
red
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
much
sweeter
and
not
as
sour
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
much
prefer
the
lighter
feel
with
greater
sour
notes
of
lambics
and
gueuzes
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
were
on
draft
somewhere
and
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
different
but
its
not
something
that
i
want
to
go
out
and
buy
another
bottle
of
or
a
beer
that
would
make
my
regular
rotation
worth
a
try
though
for
sure
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
wonderful
new
little
bar
bistro
in
stowe
vt
called
crop
i
am
exploring
the
world
of
sours
and
when
i
saw
this
on
tap
i
knew
i
had
to
get
it
that
and
they
just
ran
out
of
the
hill
farmstead
double
galaxy
ipa
that
was
my
first
choice
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
cherries
and
a
medium
sourness
the
flavor
that
is
left
in
your
mouth
as
you
put
your
glass
down
is
the
part
where
this
beer
really
shines
nice
to
pair
with
a
bland
smooth
cheese
to
reset
your
palate
i
will
most
def
order
this
again
o
what
a
great
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
keep
on
passing
and
ignoring
when
shopping
so
so
glad
i
finally
gave
it
the
attention
it
desired
and
well
deserved
the
balance
of
this
flanders
red
is
spot
on
very
enjoyable
brew
i
find
myself
stopping
from
typing
to
keep
sipping
this
mouthwatering
liquid
a
must
have
overall
very
good
a
really
nice
flanders
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
better
than
any
good
champagne
close
to
perfection
awesome
beer
very
complex
intermingling
fruit
and
malts
sour
but
not
puckering
its
sweeter
than
the
classic
red
but
is
more
tart
one
of
my
favorite
flanders
verdict
a
magnificentlycrafted
beer
that
i
wouldnt
doubt
was
better
before
rodenbach
was
bought
by
palm
one
of
the
more
effervescent
thinner
examples
of
this
style
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
joke
grouping
this
with
duchesse
but
i
get
it
o
ive
never
enjoyed
a
capped
bottle
of
the
grand
cru
previously
only
draft
and
cc
bottles
but
this
was
quite
good
very
young
and
fresh
for
a
rodenbach
but
quite
tasty
nonetheless
overall
a
beer
i
would
love
to
have
again
impressive
sour
and
sweet
combination
going
on
here
can
tell
this
is
blended
with
care
and
doesnt
spare
the
oak
aged
ales
o
a
outstanding
flanders
and
a
world
class
beer
the
fruit
and
that
sourness
are
strong
but
in
balance
with
the
other
element
im
partial
to
the
flanders
red
style
so
im
trying
not
to
let
it
bias
my
score
but
this
is
almost
perfection
o
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
depth
of
flavors
and
aromas
balanced
nicely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
ive
only
been
able
to
have
it
on
trips
to
other
states
until
now
when
it
has
become
available
in
texas
this
is
a
great
beer
to
be
paired
with
many
foods
but
it
does
especially
well
with
certain
thai
dishes
where
the
sour
andor
hot
flavors
could
overwhelm
many
beers
its
great
with
pickled
foods
and
also
with
texmex
a
classic
overall
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
and
i
definitely
will
be
buying
this
again
when
its
available
around
me
and
when
im
feeling
a
top
shelf
flanders
red
again
this
sits
on
top
of
the
list
of
belgian
red
ales
so
far
for
me
i
definitely
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
hasnt
had
this
and
already
enjoys
this
style
of
beer
and
to
anybody
that
wants
to
start
somewhere
in
the
range
of
flanders
red
style
ales
o
incredible
this
was
a
birthday
present
i
was
not
disappointed
seek
this
out
o
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
highly
recommended
and
an
easy
drinker
at
6
0
abv
this
has
a
character
that
is
all
its
own
it
is
somewhat
like
other
sours
i
have
had
but
in
a
league
of
its
own
overall
this
one
is
awesome
along
with
being
a
great
value
smell
threw
me
off
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
highly
recommend
to
any
sour
enthusiast
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
o
a
very
good
flanders
red
with
just
enough
tart
fruit
to
combat
the
oak
very
good
price
point
at
under
9
for
a
750
ml
bottle
too
probably
not
the
best
intro
for
sours
because
of
the
complexity
and
overly
funky
nose
but
aside
from
that
this
is
very
good
just
poured
the
second
part
of
the
large
bottle
and
the
color
is
incredible
i
am
truly
excited
about
this
brew
i
can
understand
how
some
folks
wont
like
the
vinegar
and
the
tartness
but
i
love
vinegar
and
this
is
an
absolutely
special
product
if
there
were
a
score
between
4
5
and
5
available
id
give
this
a
4
8
but
since
there
isnt
i
have
to
give
it
a
5
for
overall
i
mean
i
dont
think
there
is
another
beer
out
the
which
i
could
session
like
i
could
this
one
or
the
petrus
o
strange
bizarre
ale
honestly
i
cant
say
if
i
have
enjoyed
or
i
am
only
surprised
so
smooth
i
get
a
perfect
amount
of
tartness
coating
my
mouth
and
a
nice
cherry
mixed
fruit
and
then
it
goes
down
smooth
and
sweet
not
too
acidic
or
cloying
like
the
duchesse
and
the
price
is
way
too
great
9
for
a
750ml
may
be
the
best
beer
deal
next
to
old
rasputin
4
packs
flanders
red
might
be
my
favorite
belgian
style
and
rodenbach
grand
cru
is
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
tart
cherry
grape
flavor
causes
the
most
pleasant
of
puckers
nice
mild
carbonation
is
enough
to
tingle
your
tongue
and
it
has
a
synergistic
effect
with
the
tartness
what
a
fantastic
beer
poured
it
from
a
750
ml
bottle
nice
dark
rusted
reddish
hue
with
a
creamy
2
finger
head
that
disapates
slowly
light
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
all
dark
cherries
and
toasted
oak
and
vanilla
notes
smells
tart
and
sour
almost
metallic
taste
is
all
sour
cherries
and
raspberries
a
little
spice
lingers
on
the
palette
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
mouthwatering
acidity
and
long
finish
i
like
this
as
much
as
the
cuvee
des
jacobins
rouge
the
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
like
melted
brown
sugar
and
there
is
a
nice
light
cream
head
on
top
that
circles
the
glass
but
leaves
the
middle
clear
the
second
pour
produced
a
bigger
head
with
some
slight
tanning
to
it
the
beer
is
quite
dark
and
very
murky
but
there
are
some
light
carbonation
bubbles
there
is
also
a
nice
dark
rose
tinge
to
the
color
the
beer
smells
big
and
sour
with
strong
cherry
leather
wafting
the
alcohol
is
also
a
little
present
at
the
back
of
the
nose
leaving
a
slight
spicy
burn
the
beer
also
smells
richly
caramelly
but
this
is
over
powered
by
the
vinegar
sour
which
stings
at
the
nose
and
the
cherry
leather
which
plays
with
the
caramel
the
beer
tastes
wonderfully
cherry
tart
with
terrific
and
strong
esters
coming
off
the
yeast
and
suggesting
green
apples
and
slight
pineapple
accents
of
course
this
beer
is
mostly
about
the
big
sour
taste
and
it
delivers
beautifully
bringing
big
sweet
fruit
notes
over
the
tongue
while
it
puckers
the
sides
of
my
mouth
the
initial
rush
of
flavor
is
big
with
sour
cherry
but
as
the
beer
opens
up
it
really
highlights
the
esters
beautifully
the
aftertaste
is
very
strong
with
the
apple
esters
and
the
remnants
of
the
sweet
cherry
as
the
beer
warms
the
apple
esters
also
become
more
dominant
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
effervescent
with
carbonation
leaving
it
a
little
harsh
on
the
tongue
but
the
beer
is
soft
and
chewy
leaving
the
palate
wet
with
lots
of
dry
patches
and
wanting
more
as
it
puckers
with
the
sour
aftershocks
overall
this
is
another
tasty
flanders
red
that
is
quite
cheap
and
easily
accessible
making
it
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
i
liked
oude
tart
a
little
more
than
this
i
think
as
it
was
thicker
and
got
a
little
more
caramel
into
the
sour
but
this
is
a
terrific
sipper
and
is
worth
a
try
i
think
i
have
found
the
sour
beer
for
me
its
a
very
reasonable
price
and
probably
the
best
tasting
one
ive
tried
served
from
tap
into
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
tulip
poured
a
deep
dark
ruby
red
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
wood
vinegar
and
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
vinegar
fruit
wood
and
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
have
had
this
one
before
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
carries
over
quite
well
ontap
as
well
the
vinegar
touch
on
this
brew
is
what
keeps
me
coming
back
to
it
over
and
over
this
also
includes
the
various
vintage
versions
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
as
well
really
enjoyable
and
definitely
brings
the
pucker
along
for
the
ride
to
keep
you
on
your
toes
an
absolute
must
try
as
rodenbach
is
doing
good
things
with
this
one
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
higherlevel
carbonation
that
foams
the
beer
substantially
across
the
palate
overall
mouthfeel
is
at
first
fizzy
then
smooth
and
creamy
suitable
for
the
style
closes
dryly
with
notable
lingering
tartness
on
sides
of
palate
overall
blended
vinegar
and
cherry
juice
decent
cold
but
warms
close
to
jelly
an
thats
just
weird
flanders
reds
are
weird
this
is
no
exception
on
the
spectrum
of
a
dank
sponge
in
a
basement
to
straightup
vinegar
this
is
on
the
vinegar
side
nicely
complex

can
i

find
the
character
of
this

in

more
pronounced

the
sourness
almost
puckers
the
mouth
the
oaken
notes
are

both
in

and
i
think
i
will
never
buy
the
330ml
again
if
this
is
available
tantalizing
style
but
it
may
be
a

fruitiness

this
is

by

a

however
sour
acidity
erases
all
this
with
a

fizz
on
the
tongue
tart
cherries
and
vinegar
somehow
mix
as
the
sourness
climaxes
into
the
finish
not
puckeringly
sour
but
refreshingly
sour
especially
after
the
sweetness
early
on
i
was
prepared
to
not
really
like
this
beer
much
but
now
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
strange
and
delicious
very
lively
with
champagne
like
fizz
on
the
tongue
that
works
wonders
with
the
sweetsour
balance
might
not
be
able
to
drink
pitchers
of
it
but
better
than
expected
i
can
possibly
maybe
see
this
beer
paired
with
food
and
improving
but
its
a
stretch
im
actually
a
bit
curious
to
sample
this
again
in
the
distant
future
and
see
if
i
enjoy
it
the
second
time
around
i
actually
wouldnt
rule
out
the
possibility
that
we
got
a
bad
bottle
but
as
it
stands
this
is
the
least
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
that
said
its
certainly
different
perhaps
this
could
be
excellent
with
the
proper
food
pairing
and
served
in
a
smaller
vessel
im
working
on
23
of
a
750
at
this
point
lots
of
extra
points
for
rather
rare
flavors
to
encounter
in
a
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
can
appreciate
but
not
perhaps
love
d
i
cant
drink
much
of
this
bc
sour
really
isnt
my
thing
but
i
would
drink
it
again
just
as
something
different
not
really
my
type
of
a
beer
drinkability
truly
a
very
unique
beer
that
people
should
try
for
themselves
next
time
i
buy
this
i
going
to
get
this
in
the
big
750
size
the
11
2oz
bottle
is
too
small
a
great
beer
sour
cherry
taste
with
oak
and
vanilla
high
carbonation
refreshing
but
not
super
high
carbonation
due
to
the
sourness
a
very
unique
and
tasty
beer
truely
amazing
since
there
is
no
fruit
added
to
this
beer
aroma
is
sweet
white
fruits
and
balsamic
vinegar
amberbrown
color
with
a
smallish
and
mostly
diminishing
head
fore
is
balsamic
vinegar
and
tart
cherries
flavor
range
is
narrow
highlighting
the
vinegar
and
fruits
and
carries
through
to
the
dry
acidic
finish
drinkability
i
liked
it
less
at
first
and
more
as
i
progressed
generally
this
isnt
a
beer
id
revisit
but
its
not
bad
just
not
for
me
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
belgian
red
ale
but
here
goes
pours
with
a
light
head
and
good
lacing
the
color
is
a
dark
reddish
amber
that
is
fairly
uniform
the
ale
smells
of
sour
fruits
and
wine
with
a
slight
nutty
hint
it
smells
amazing
the
taste
is
where
this
ale
declines
in
my
opinion
sour
grapes
and
cranberries
are
the
primary
flavor
while
the
tartness
tends
to
take
away
from
this
red
ale
for
me
a
little
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
tartness
could
help
this
ale
is
however
very
fruity
in
taste
however
sour
and
the
acidic
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
unpleasent
as
well
not
something
one
could
drink
consistently
i
wouldnt
think
mouthfeel
probably
could
us
6
months
to
mellow
and
have
the
flavors
blend
almost
unripe
still
easy
drinking
for
a
sour
ale
this
brew
is
certainly
an
aquired
taste
unusual
and
complex
this
brew
is
good
for
a
change
of
pace
updated
on
012312
with
a
vintage
bottle
from
the
celler
i
think
from
2005
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
very
sour
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
yeast
sour
aroma
very
enticing
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
refreshingly
sour
taste
that
is
solid
on
the
malts
and
easy
drinking
it
boasts
belgian
crystal
and
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
it
is
quite
refreshing
it
has
great
malt
character
and
an
excellent
yeast
sourness
large
bottle
caged
and
corked
with
a
foil
enclosure
to
boot
best
before

of

theres
a
good
place
to
put

pours
an
interesting
chestnut
shade
of
amber
with
a
slight
dark
cherry
hue
well
developed
lacing
emerges
from
a
light
tan
puffy
head
which
exhibited
moderate
retention
nose
also
i
would
characterize
as
interesting
sweet
nutty
and
fruity
this
brew
is
a
classic
of
the
style
sour
sweetsmokyacidic
complex
not
for
everybody
this
style
takes
awhile
for
most
to
warm
up
to
and
appreciate
it
goes
well
with
food
particularily
fish
with
lemon
as
noted
on
the
label
tasty
mysterious
interesting
and
thirst
quenching
get
some
taste
it
taste
it
again
come
to
love
it
dark
reddishamber
color
with
a
medium
thick
eggshell
white
head
that
lasts
fairly
long
thick
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
of
sour
cherry
and
grape
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
too
mediumbodied
and
super
tart
and
vinous
and
first
but
smoother
as
it
warms
sour
fruit
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
with
cherry
and
apple
being
dominant
some
light
spices
and
malts
are
there
as
well
the
finish
is
dry
and
fruity
admittedly
i
usually
struggle
with
this
style
but
this
is
a
complex
and
wellcrafted
beer
drinkability
the
acidity
seems
too
much
at
first
but
the
bottle
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
fantastic
beer
maybe
not
for
everyone
do
you
like
sour
beer
but
i
think
thats
just
the
nature
of
the
style
no
doubt
this
is
an
acquired
taste
i
for
one
couldnt
keep
my
nose
out
of
the
glass
what
an
aroma
funky
fruity
sweetyeast
vinegar
spicemagic
marker
sugar
oak
vanilla
cherries
sourcandies
you
cant
count
all
the
smells
the
taste
is
equally
thrilling
sour
and
mouth
puckering
one
minute
sweet
and
succulent
the
next
i
enjoy
this
style
by
taking
long
deep
sniffs
followed
by
small
slow
sips
i
swear
that
you
can
experience
something
different
each
time
this
brew
is
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
and
very
earthy
at
times
it
seems
to
have
a
musty
woodslike
quality
about
it
the
tart
acidity
is
refreshing
and
really
clears
the
pallet
for
another
sip
the
liquid
is
a
deep
brownish
red
with
a
respectable
head
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
lingering
funky
finish
very
easy
to
drink
think
i
could
use
a
smoke
right
about
now
mother
pucker
that
ones
taaaart
right
out
of
the
aromas
barnyardy
vineous
and
muskiness
makes
the
mouth
water
and
the
eye
twitch
looks
burgundy
in
color
with
a
lightly
creamy
offwhite
head
that
fleeted
quickly
flavors
of
cider
cherries
and
tart
berries
accompany
the
intense
tartness
though
malt
sweetness
offers
a
nice
mellowness
it
never
balances
the
beer
correctly
it
could
have
more
sweetness
alcoholic
and
lightly
astringent
in
the
mouth
feel
a
woodsy
flavor
persists
in
the
aftertaste
i
like
it
but
it
makes
my
teeth
hurt
good
for
all
flanders
lovers
thanks
sheepnuts
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
save
it
for
special
occasions
would
be
good
with
a
nice
meal
the
smell
is
of
wine
no
question
about
it
maybe
some
hidden
caramel
in
there
too
the
taste
will
take
you
if
you
are
not
prepared
it
tastes
like
wine
as
well
a
very
distinct
flavor
af
soured
grapes
the
mouthfeel
is
active
the
carbonation
comes
alive
the
drinkability
is
affected
by
the
alcohol
if
the
alcohol
was
not
so
up
front
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
i
could
not
drink
this
much
but
it
would
be
ok
time
to
time
drinkablilty
very
bracingly
refreshing
a
welcome
treat
when
you
have
a
thirst
to
slake
i
found
that
the
sourness
while
delightful
at
first
becomes
overwhelming
at
length
this
was
a
750
ml
bottle
that
i
saved
for
a
few
months
for
a
special
night
best
before
date
is
stamped
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
its
a
bit
hard
to
make
out
mdr
had
a
wine
like
mouthfeel
to
it
with
carbonation
befitting
the
style
good
sipping
brew
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
rodenbach
classic
duchess
monks
and
la
folie
drinkability
while
the
flavors
meld
and
transition
nicely
i
dont
see
this
as
an
ale
meant
for
pounding
it
is
however
nice
for
sipping
especially
as
it
warms
translucent
ruby
brown
tiny
bubbled
head
persistant
ring
and
some
lacing
gobs
of
carbonation
the
smell
has
a
little
aspirinish
odor
connoting
a
sour
taste
is
coming
there
is
also
a
malty
aroma
albeit
twisted
by
the
sourness
tart
starts
it
all
off
but
never
puckering
the
malt
base
washes
through
in
the
middle
balance
is
not
bad
at
all
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
with
a
light
body
and
carbonic
finish
there
are
lots
of
bubbles
in
this
one
plenty
of
sour
burps
not
overpowering
actually
pleasant
for
a
flanders
and
paired
very
well
with
grilled
porkchops
spouse
really
liked
it
too
a
first
for
a
sour
brew
from
the
sour
start
to
the
sweet
center
to
the
funky
finish
its
a
series
of
interesting
personalities
its
a
cider
thats
a
wine
thats
a
fine
flemish
sour
red
granted
its
not
for
every
taste
but
if
it
is
for
yours
it
would
be
easy
to
crave
it
all
comes
together
with
a
workable
abv
to
start
and
remain
drinkable
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
its
the
fun
sassy
taste
of
belgium
in
a
glass
750
ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
pours
slightly
cloudy
light
ruby
color
thin
offwhite
heawine
like
in
the
nose
smells
like
port
slightly
smoky
and
some
alcohol
what
hits
in
the
flavor
off
the
bat
is
the
sharp
acidity
very
tart
fruity
and
sour
hints
of
oak
in
the
finish
but
subtle
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
certainly
one
to
savor
some
will
be
turned
off
by
the
sourness
but
certainly
a
beer
that
you
should
try
at
least
once
to
appreciate
the
differences
this
bottle
cant
be
very
old
as
i
dont
believe
they
have
been
importing
this
for
long
cool
silkscreened
label
red
in
color
very
little
head
but
creamy
with
beautiful
lacing
smells
pretty
straightforwardly
of
sourness
like
vinegar
i
love
the
smell
but
know
that
many
people
would
turn
away
mouthpuckering
sourness
with
a
superdry
finish
very
acidic
and
dry
boy
thats
good
and
a
great
apertif
in
my
opinion
the
most
sour
of
the
sour
flemish
beers
less
evenly
balanced
less
sweet
more
woodtoned
than
the
classic
variant
very
pleasing
for
lovers
of
the
style
however
at
the
front
a
brief
cherry
sweetness
that
quickly
gives
way
to
a
consuming
sourness
750
ml
corked
bottle
the
beer
pours
out
a
dark
red
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
of
wood
vinegar
and
funk
flavor
starts
off
sweet
and
sour
with
some
cherry
flavor
not
overly
sweet
theres
a
bit
of
a
strange
metal
taste
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
pretty
tart
but
not
cheek
puckering
medium
bodied
with
a
spritzy
carbonation
good
drinkability
i
never
had
the
old
version
but
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
drinkability
one
of
the
better
flanders
for
sure
super
easy
to
drink
great
sweet
and
sour
combo
mouthfeel
is
sugary
sour
and
lingering
with
some
lip
smacking
goodness
drinkability
i
wouldnt
want
this
all
the
time
but
it
was
quite
tasty
everyone
should
try
it
once
from
notes
pours
a
deep
deep
rubyhued
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
fell
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
sweet
and
sour
cherry
but
not
overbearing
very
clean
and
slightly
crisp
incredibly
enjoyable
right
on
where
i
expect
things
flavor
was
as
good
as
the
nose
promised
light
sour
cherry
creamy
oak
notes
with
moderate
sourness
just
incredible
the
beer
left
just
a
touch
of
sticky
spit
it
was
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
incredible
brew
right
what
i
want
from
the
style
incredible
balance
loved
this
beer
drinkability
wish
it
was
bottled
in
a
smaller
bottle
while
i
enjoy
the
style
for
a
change
of
pace
it
is
not
something
i
can
consume
in
quantity
25
4oz
bottle
new
version
this
one
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
tall
head
that
falls
moderately
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
very
attractive
the
aroma
is
full
of
cherry
notes
with
sourness
lingering
in
the
back
slight
funkiness
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
very
tasty
great
mixture
of
the
sour
and
the
cherries
extremely
smooth
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
good
drinkability
is
good
very
tasty
would
enjoy
more
little
pricey
in
tn
4
30
for
the
33cl
but
already
craving
another
wish
i
could
give
this
more
for
drinkability
but
i
couldnt
see
having
too
many
of
these
in
one
night
however
with
two
flanders
reds
under
my
belt
i
can
say
i
have
discovered
a
style
i
can
definitely
enjoy
on
occassion
very
satisfying
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
a
deep
burgundy
with
a
large
blooming
headsour
cherry
to
be
expected
dominate
the
aromas
with
a
touch
of
iron
and
barnyard
as
well
this
stuff
can
make
you
pucker
sour
cherry
hits
hard
on
the
tastebuds
but
rounds
nicely
into
a
more
sweet
cherrypie
like
flavor
in
the
finish
it
has
an
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
as
i
drink
more
the
more
it
grows
on
me
once
your
palate
gets
used
to
the
sour
tinge
this
stuff
goes
down
very
easilyglad
to
try
this
classic
draught
i
didnt
expect
the
aroma
of
this
it
was
a
lot
like
a
fine
red
wine
there
were
some
notes
of
sour
cherries
in
there
as
well
as
some
sweet
malts
a
dark
reddishbrownamber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
with
some
lacing
deliciously
sour
taste
of
cranberriesapples
excellent
this
is
some
complex
stuff
redish
brown
in
colour
not
much
of
a
head
but
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
falls
somewhere
between
sour
cherries
and
cranberries
with
a
hint
of
red
wine
vinegar
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
smell
with
some
malt
and
cola
notes
mixed
in
as
well
the
palate
was
surprisingly
light
and
fizzy
which
made
this
beer
quite
refreshing
overall
this
isnt
the
type
of
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
of
the
time
but
its
still
fantastic
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
pretty
clear
with
a
big
off
white
head
that
laces
smell
is
sweet
with
a
very
sour
cherry
type
aroma
taste
is
all
sour
cherries
cranberry
juice
in
the
middle
then
a
very
dry
tart
finish
very
strong
sour
aftertaste
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
and
thick
low
carbonation
excellent
ale
the
rodenbach
beers
are
of
the
highest
caliber
and
this
is
their
finest
its
refreshing
and
exciting

had
rated
it
earlier
guess
not

either
norms
or
whole
foods
label
is
in
dutch
a
beer
with
a
very
clean
finish
though
not
the
most
drinkable
the
aroma
is
very
welcoming
suggestive
of
a
dry
sour
cherry
like
flavour
a
complex
flavour
indeed
the
flavour
starts
with
an
intense
vinegar
sourness
followed
by
hints
of
dry
hops
aftertaste
the
aged
oak
taste
is
quite
addictive
and
very
much
defines
the
character
of
this
beer
maybe
i
will
try
this
one
again
with
fish
and
chips
for
just
an
experiment

err

blew
me
away
huge

almost
and
funky
taste
was
as
per
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
linctus
phocodeine
cough
medicine
that
i
used
to
take
when
i
was
a
kid
but
with
a
little
more
funk
and
sophistication
what
an
amazing
beer
really
enjoyed
it
didnt
expect
it
to
be
as
sour
as
it
was
but
loved
it
couldnt
drink
em
all
night
but
fantastic
with
food
or
after
dinner
thanks
to
my
good
pal
evan
for
sharing
this
treat
after
fifty
begs
and
a
firstborn
i
usually
dont
like
sour
beers
but
i
figured
id
give
this
a
try
as
it
was
being
reintroduced
to
the
us
and
the
brewer
was
in
my
friends
bar
sean
bolans
at
the
time
poured
on
tap
into
a
rodenbach
stemmed
glass
sorta
a
redish
dark
ruby
color
initial
smell
is
of
sour
cherries
taste
really
surprised
me
not
nearly
as
tart
as
the
bottled
version
i
had
lots
of
sour
cherries
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
an
acidic
tartness
aftertaste
of
the
cherries
lingers
somewhat
unpleasantly
in
your
mouth
although
others
may
like
this
not
nearly
as
badly
as
the
bottled
version
in
my
opinion
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
row
though
i
cleansed
my
pallate
with
a
dominion
real
ale
afterwards
will
never
be
my
favorite
beer
but
then
again
i
dont
really
like
the
style
others
seem
to
love
this
beer
so
by
all
means
check
it
out
michael
at
the
eulogy
bar
was
kind
enough
to
let
us
sample
this
rare
beer
at
his
bar
poured
into
an
authentic
rodenbach
stemmed
glass
this
beer
looked
fabulous
from
the
start

glowing
bright
amber
in
appearance
and
topped
with
a
thin
lacy
head
of
foam
the
aroma
is
exceptional
and
very
misleading
like
a
lamb
in
wolfs
clothing
after
the
first
whiff
you
would
think
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
very
heavy
beer
with
a
big
body
freshly
tapped
maple
syrup
was
the
initial
aroma
then
came
oak
vanilla
and
finished
with
tart
bing
cherries
the
beer
is
truly
revealed
after
the
first
sip
light
and
almost
airy
with
a
perfect
sourness
the
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
leaves
a
lemon
zestfulness
on
the
tongue
a
real
beauty
of
a
beer
e
reviewed
from
a
33cl
bottle
with
a
date
on
the
back
of
010306
appearance
is
of
a
cherry
wood
colored
body
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
a
bit
bubbly
in
the
glass
this
left
a
decent
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
quite
rich
with
tart
cherries
and
some
sweet
malt
notes
of
woodiness
also
blend
in
quite
well
the
tartness
had
a
bit
of
edge
to
it
flavor
starts
off
with
tart
fruits
up
front
the
sourness
is
cut
a
bit
by
an
underlying
sweetness
and
woodiness
not
as
balanced
as
the
red
but
it
works
out
better
that
way
a
biting
sourness
with
a
hint
of
cherries
is
how
this
finishes
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
carbonation
and
is
very
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
is
exceptional
i
should
have
got
me
some
more
of
this
when
i
had
the
chance
very
tasty
and
refreshing
this
will
definitely
get
me
more
into
the
style
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
frothy
light
tan
head
which
diminishes
to
a
layer
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
no
lacing
down
the
glass
sour
aroma
some
fruits
too
strong
sour
flavour
which
lasts
and
lasts
not
too
overpowering
though
nice
like
lemonade
thats
the
closest
thing
i
can
match
it
to
lemonade
with
some
malt
a
taste
until
what
ive
normally
tried
in
a
beer
ive
only
ever
tried
one
gueuze
before
and
now
this
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
an
intriguing
style
tasty
for
certain
but
im
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
i
do
like
the
sour
taste
but
im
not
sure
i
could
have
many
of
them
still
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
i
tried
this
beer
with
no
preconceptions
although
it
was
a
belgian
grand
cru
it
may
be
my
first
flanders
red
ale
but
ive
had
quite
a
few
oak
aged
beers
in
the
past
i
didnt
like
the
taste
too
sour
very
unique
and
lacking
in
a
real
beer
feel
tasted
like
shiraz
in
that
it
was
dry
and
peppery
although
it
also
had
a
watery
consistency
generally
it
was
unpleasant
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
another
one
and
ill
be
noting
my
aversion
to
the
style
not
many
beers
of
this
style
are
available
in
australia
a
real
disappointment
a
multi
coloured
brew
depending
on
how
the
light
hits
the
glass
the
colour
changes
sometimes
its
almost
purple
other
times
cola
black
sometimes
red
considering
the
colour
it
most
appears
to
be
is
red
ill
say
its
red
sort
of
a
cherry
red
quickly
foams
up
only
to
die
down
with
no
head
glass
is
clean
so
i
know
thats
not
the
reason
still
little
whisps
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
first
smell
is
sour
lots
of
citrus
cherries
and
some
raw
malt
first
taste
whoa
hits
you
unexpectedly
sour
at
first
then
finishes
with
some
malt
and
vanilla
sweetness
second
taste
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
stronger
but
the
sourness
does
not
weaken
aftertaste
is
a
bit
strong
of
cherries
not
to
my
liking
but
a
minor
setback
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
smooth
pretty
good
beer
but
for
me
the
cherry
aftertaste
is
too
strong
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
truly
remarkable
overall
its
ok
i
guess
fans
of
lambics
might
like
it
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
get
more
i
was
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
beer
so
when
my
friend
got
a
hold
of
a
bottle
i
was
quite
excited
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
light
read
hues
and
no
head
on
it
the
aroma
had
a
dry
grape
smell
along
with
some
sweetness
the
flavor
was
just
sour
sour
sour
like
a
mean
old
woman
also
some
flavors
of
cherry
kriek
and
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
flavor
but
the
cherry
and
the
yeast
flavors
were
getting
the
shit
beaten
out
of
them
by
the
sourness
just
like
my
palate
the
beer
was
puckering
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
a
ferric
character
to
it
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
had
such
high
hopes
but
htey
were
dashed
in
a
blaze
of
sourness
this
beer
was
just
too
sour
for
my
tastes
thanks
but
no
thanks
not
my
style
330ml
brown
bottle
with

clearly
printed
on

the
finish
is
very
light
with
a
lingering
tartness
and
wine
flavors
in
the
burp
quite
an
experience
i
really
enjoy
this
style
the
taste
is
a
tart
cranberrychocolate
malt
mostly
cran
w
soem
oak
wood
flavors
but
not
really
dry
maybe
like
a
merlot
wine
w
a
mild
aftertaste
the
feel
is
a
tart
and
bitey
feel
w
tickling
carbonation
and
a
mild
aftertaste
this
was
a
new
beer
for
me
to
try
so
i
was
quite
suprised
and
interested
in
this
style
now
poured
a
dark
brownish
red
a
pinkish
white
head
and
soapy
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
nose
was
acidic
vinegar
and
like
a
dry
red
wine
taste
was
quite
something
the
sourness
shocked
the
tastebuds
during
the
first
few
sips
but
this
diminishes
as
you
drink
and
some
cherry
flavour
some
sweetness
pokes
through
has
qualities
of
a
red
wine
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
finish
was
dry
but
the
tartness
really
limits
the
drinkability
at
least
for
me
anyway
pours
a
dark
red
effervescent
with
a
bubbly
pinkishwhite
head
my
friend
commented
that
it
looked
really
good
she
like
red
things
aroma
of
wild
yeasts
winey
very
good
taste
was
tart
with
a

flavour
right
off
with
some

at
the
finish
the
ingredients
list
corn
but
i
thankfully
didnt
taste
any
this
has
a
light
bubbly
mouthfeel
akin
to
wine
this
was
tart
if
not
downright
sour
but
if
you
like
sour
which
i
do
tis
a
grand
grand

truely
remarkable
i
wish
there
were
more
commercial
examples
of
this
style
available
in
canada
its
really
incredibly
i
was
fortunate
to
sample
this
beauty
complements
of
the
famous
sam
poured
into
my
westmalle
glass
apearance
was
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
small
head
forming
at
the
top
first
taste
was
a
bit
surprising
and
definatley
pleasing
a
bit
sour
but
in
a
very
good
way
countered
by
a
slight
sweetness
a
la
cherries
although
it
may
seem
odd
when
describing
a
beer
it
truely
was
sweet
and
sour
the
first
swill
coated
my
mouth
and
delighted
my
pallet
as
the
sweet
and
sour
played
a
beautiful
symphony
on
my
tongue
i
know
it
sounds
cheesy
but
if
you
have
tried
this
beer
you
will
know
the
rosy
crap
is
from
the
heart
every
sip
brought
on
a
new
appreciation
for
this
beer
i
was
crying
for
more
when
finished
and
will
definiatley
have
another
go
at
this
one
i
had
previously
tried
a
sour
tasting
beer
but
didnt
get
it
after
this
beer
i
finally
do
those
that
have
the
privilige
of
trying
this
beer
must
do
so
at
once
i
cant
believe
this
beer
came
into
bc
but
dreams
sometimes
come
true
the
dark
red
colour
is
quite
a
sight
in
a
nice
chalice
the
nose
is
sour
old
and
very
different
from
any
other
beer
including
duchesse
de
bourgogne
the
taste
is
oakyaged
fruity
and
most
importantly
smooth
you
can
feel
the
time
that
this
beer
has
spent
in
barrels
gives
a
cellared
taste
that
melds
all
the
flavours
into
a
fine
blend
not
as
intense
as
duchesse
or
as
earthy
as
goudenband
this
beer
is
truly
a
class
act
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
brownish
highlights
very
small
cap
of
head
tops
the
beer
smell
is
musty
and
vinegary
smells
of
a
german
cherry
vinegar
i
used
once
taste
is
similar
sour
cherries
wine
vinegar
pucker
the
cheeks
a
note
of
horsey
funkiness
also
creeps
into
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
low
carbonation
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
which
probably
wouldnt
be
to
style
any
how
a
nice
beer
with
dinner
or
a
salad
definately
not
a
session
beer
but
one
that
i
would
definately
pick
up
again
this
is
not
beer
it
is
red
wine
vinegar
made
with
malt
sour
with
an
earthy
base
low
carbination
medium
body
sweetness
is
present
to
balance
the
sour
but
this
is
not
chinese
food
so
i
will
pass
on
the
sweet
and
sour
combination
smooth
on
the
palate
the
beer
says
nothing
if
it
does
not
say
sour
cherries
absolutely
a
classic
and
perfect
for
style
i
could
enjoy
one
of
these
any
time
of
day
anywhere
rerate
drank
it
out
of
a
proper
glass

time
still

still
this

an
exciting

it
will
not

my
last
beer
of
this
style
okay
i
know
i
wrote
my
rating
of
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
a
bit
earlier
today
but
i
actually
drank
the
rodenbach
45
days
before
the
duchesse
wow
just
one
of
those
beers
you
remember
like
yesterday
and
informs
every
opinion
of
the
flemish
red
style
youve
ever
had
gets
the
balance
of
sourness
fruitiness
sweet
and
cinnamon
spice
and
oak
conditioning
perfect
for
what
the
beer
style
requires
the
bottle
i
enjoyed
was
past
its
best
by
date
and
such
aging
was
happily
enjoyed
what
an
experience
who
knows
when
and
if
ill
ever
catch
another
one
only
a
trip
to
belgium
would
make
it
possible
the
taste
was
incredibly
complex
it
was
tart
and
sour
somewhat
fruity
and
it
very
strongly
tasted
of
red
wine
there
were
oak
notes
hovering
in
the
background
truly
a
unique
experience
deliciously
sour
and
tart
dryness
from
the
oak

lovely

puckering

it
had
noticeable
sediment
from
the
oak
barrel
which
prevented
the
last
drops
and
takes
away
from
its
georgeous
redbrown
colour

tart
real
vanilla

works

as
good

can

notes
a
pretty
exceptional
brew
i
have
had
better
from
this
brewery
in
the
past
though
this
one
still
stands
up
to
be
a
quality
brew
for
sure
a
legend
in
the
realms
of
the
flanders
red
some
sweetness
but
generally
overpowered
and
knocked
into
touch
by
a
whack
of
acidic
fresh
fruit

quintessential

sweet

reddish
colored
brew
with
a
nice
bubbly
head
with
standard
retention
aroma
is
nice
mix
of
oak
and
cherry
with
some
acidic
and
tart
note
also
noticeable
taste
is
an
extremely
complex
mix
of
oak
sour
cherry
without
the
sweetness
and
some
tart
and
acidic
notes
also
mix
in
there
the
finish
is
quite
bitter
carbonation
is
average
and
body
is
medium
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
is
also
very
refreshing
now
if
i
can
get
my
hand
on
some
alexander
i
would
be
a
happy
man
im
also
reminded
of
eating
too
many
saltandvinegar
chips
at
once
definite
parallels
it
pours
a
beautiful
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
head
that
dissipates
fast
the
first
thing
i
noted
in
the
aroma
was
wood
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
it
and
then
the
maltiness
and
a
lactic
sourness
can
be
detected
as
well
it
is
very
complex
and
elegant
to
drink
it
is
tart
with
some
fruity
cherry
notes
there
is
some
wood
notes
as
well
as
some
wine
notes
the
perfect
marriage
between
sweet
and
sour
with
a
somewhat
dry
lactic
finish
the
amazing
beer
is
truly
the
standard
for
the
style

the
taste
upfront
is

in
the
middle
and
a
dry
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
sour

very
dry

on
a
chocolatelike
profile
lavish
and
extravagant
im
not
trying
to
hype
the
beer
up
at
all
but
this
is
the
real
deal
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
balances
out
the
lactic
sourness
of
this
beer
complex
changes
many
times
on
the
tongue
with
each
sip
really
plays
with
you

it

thanks
go
out
to
a
friend

parents
live

bring
beers

coming
back

quintessential
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
but
i
know
the
story
a
totally
opaque
redbrwon
color
the
very
fine
head
fades
quickly
but
doesnt
die
the
smell
is
of
vinegar
sourness
and
tart
but
with
some
fruity
and
sweet
aspects
the
taste
is
what
the
smell
makes
you
expect
the
tart
and
sour
aspects
are
so
strong
that
theyre
almost
not
unpleasing
i
got
an
impression
of
baked
cookies
after
a
while
butter
and
eggs
the
sourness
fades
as
i
got
used
to
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
aggressive
and
thick
it
overwhelms
the
palate
and
takes
time
to
fade
ill
try
to
taste
this
brew
again
in
a
few
months
to
see
if
the
evolution
of
my
palate
makes
it
more
easy
to
drink
for
me
as
of
now
drinkable
is
not
a
word
i
could
use
for
that
beer
although
i
can
appreciate
its
disturbing
complexity
other
i
first
tried
this
about
6
months
ago
without
really
knowing
much
about
the
style
or
the
beer
an
opportunity
arose
to
try
it
again
with
slightly
more
experience
under
my
belt
and
i
took
it
original
review
4
05
after
having
this
4
times
in
the
last
2
weeks
i
indeed
cant
see
myself
ever
growing
tired
of
it
and
raise
the
rating
one
point
overall
and
there
might
be
more
to
come
bottom
line
ridiculously
good
and
a
possible
new
favorite
just
amazing
taste
is
quite
sour
and
cherry
tart
the
fruity
tartness
overpowers
most
of
the
other
flavors
lots
of
cherry
flavors
in
here
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
way
back
there
my
only
complaint
is
that
with
the
sour
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
strong
coppery
aftertaste
which
i
dont
find
appeaing
dont
know
if
that
is
indicative
of
the
style
or
this
bottle
is
past
its
prime
full
bodied
and
flavorful
beer
this
was
the
flavor
explosion
i
was
expecting
from
the
rodenbach
red
not
nearly
as
balanced
but
still
amazing
rodenbach
grand
cru
has
a
vasty
different
flavor
from
what
most
people
imagine
when
they
think
of
beer
this
isnt
something
im
going
to
start
drinking
daily
even
if
i
could
afford
to
but
its
a
still
a
very
interesting
and
challenging
beer
im
glad
to
have
tried
served
chilled
though
not
terribly
cold
aroma
is
wonderfully
full
carmelish
and
not
sour
refreshing
initial
taste
though
perhaps
too
sweet
for
some
flavor
really
opens
up
after
the
first
sip
cherries
i
think
though
certainly
some
citrus
taste
as
well
finish
is
clean
and
even
tart
very
easy
to
drink
not
heavy
at
all
appearance
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
leaves
behind
webbed
fine
belgian
style
lacing
aroma
vinous
and
effervescent
some
tart
cherry
or
raspberry
tones
to
it
leaves
a
woody
almost
cedar
like
finish
to
it
an
oud
bruin
in
all
of
its
glory
taste
whopping
array
of
tart
tones
but
its
multilayered
a
tartness
forms
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
then
sweet
fruit
grapes
again
the
wine
like
tone
very
vinous
and
mild
chocolate
tones
soften
the
mouthfeel
by
applying
some
sweetness
to
the
overall
profile
of
the
flavor
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
in
that
its
spritzy
on
the
back
of
the
throat
but
it
still
tends
to
be
smooth
going
down
a
medium
bodied
masterpiece
a
step
above
petrus
oud
bruin
in
my
opinion
drinkability
the
tartness
does
a
lot
to
the
palate
and
i
believe
this
one
should
be
enjoyed
slowly
in
small
portions
theres
alot
going
on
relax
and
explore
this
beer
theres
no
rush
highly
recommended
i
was
utterly
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
alexander
is
so
much
better
definately
an
acquired
taste
it
wasnt
total
crap
but
i
was
wanting
a
lot
more
and
i
can
find
it
much
better
with
numerous
other
belgians
worth
a
try
but
again
its
going
to
be
one
of
those
beers
you
either
really
love
or
really
hate
im
heading
toward
the
latter
medium
weight
in
the
mouth
with
an
outstanding
balance
of
sour
fruitiness
and
malt
the
earthiness
is
there
again
to
add
complexity
unbelievable
length
and
excellent
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
on
its
own
and
incredible
with
food
served
in
its
correct
glass
at
the
bier
circus
in
brussels
belgium
this
beer
is
rodenbachs
big
brother
this
is
a
darker
nearly
brown
coloured
ale
with
a
reddishbeige
cap
of
foam
the
aromas
are
just
like
that
of
regular
rodenback
but
intensified
to
a
new
level
a
new
level
of
lactic
a
new
level
of
sour
a
new
level
of
cherry
and
a
new
level
of
smooth
the
taste
is
sheer
perfection
as
fresh
cherry
flavor
dances
with
the
flavors
of
oak
and
tart
sourness
imparted
into
this
beer
by
some
unknown
forces
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
creamy
smooth
great
the
drinkability
once
again
wonderful
sadly
the
drink
left
the
glass
too
soon
can
i
get
a
magnum
please
a
somewhat
nebulous
ruby
red
to
almost
brown
color
the
head
modest
in
size
and
frothy
in
consistency
light
tan
in
color
with
some
decent
lace
to
coat
the
glass
nose
is
tart
cherries
with
sweet
hints
of
maple
syrup
yeast
and
a
real
dream
of
a
nose
sweet
and
sour
start
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
finish
prickly
in
its
acidity
hops
perfect
in
their
bite
very
dry
vinous
almost
wow
what
a
great
beer
guess
if
i
want
any
more
i
will
need
phone
belgium
overall
impression
having
finally
acquired
a
taste
for
geuze
and
the
like
i
can
definitely
see
the
appeal
of
this
beer
and
why
its
a
hallmark
of
its
style
would
be
great
to
cook
with
in
place
of
wine
too
reddish
color
slightly
cloudy
small
head
very
vinous
nose
winelike
esters
vinous
taste
normal
for
belgian
red
ales
despite
the
vinous
taste
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
to
the
beer
rich
full
flavor
that
gets
better
the
more
you
sip
it
definitely
an
acquired
taste
but
it
is
the
best
of
style
finish
is
clean
vinous
and
sharp
aftertaste
has
a
hint
of
cherry
i
consumed
the
second
half
of
my
bottle
with
pickled
herring
in
a
white
wine
sauce
with
some
sweet
onion
they
matched
perfectly
the
meal
cost
next
to
nothing
but
i
felt
like
i
should
have
paid
an
arm
for
the
joy
i
got
to
experience
it
definitely
never
gets
old
devine
exceptional
a
true
classic
this
is
an
incredibly
challenging
and
assertive
beer
i
sampled
it
at
around
8
or
9
degrees
c
the
lovely
reddish
colour
and
woody
aroma
are
very
inviting
it
has
a
very
oily
and
tart
taste
and
the
use
of
oak
casks
is
quite
obvious
there
are
also
hints
of
fruit
sour
plumcherry
and
some
slight
vanilla
notes
you
must
try
this
beer
forget
the
port
have
a
grand
cru
this
is
perfect
soulful
emotionally
wrenching
beer
it
must
be
ranked
above
all
other
beers
i
know
pours
with
a
garnet
hue
and
a
white
head
aroma
is
mostly
sour
cherries
the
taste
is
quite
winelike
with
a
cherry
flavored
tartness
this
has
to
be
the
most
underrated
style
in
the
world
with
beers
like
this
out
there
i
wonder
why
we
dont
see
more
flemish
sour
ales

a

flavored
beefed
up
old
bruin
concomitantly
rich
and
satiating
yet
teasingly
whimsical
beckoning
the

for

this

to
be
in
a
750

outstanding

before

this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
amber
color
and
formed
an
off
white
foamy
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
chocolate
caramel
and
cherries
the
flavor
was
of
cherries
and
some
malt
and
the
sourness
of
it
is
definately
there
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
originally
sampled
19
may
2003
rodenbach
grand
cru
is
brownreddish
in
color
with
a
vinuous
aroma
the
sourness
on
the
tongue
is
quite
pleasant
this
is
a
complex
brew
not
for
a
beginner
however
it
is
certainly
a
beer
that
any
serious
beer
drinker
should
try
while
this
is
undoubtedly
a
finely
crafted
beer
it
smells
and
tastes
similar
to
a
finely
crafted
sparkling
apple
wine
it
pours
a
red
tinted
oxford
a
longlasting
complex
earthy
aroma
of
malt
hops
green
apples
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
are
unusual
for
a
beer
the
medium
malt
body
is
thinner
than
it
appears
theres
a
trace
caramel
flavor
and
a
light
sweetness
to
meekly
counter
the
strong
lemony
citrus
and
acidic
bitterness
tart
green
apples
pear
and
oaky
wood
round
out
the
flavors
a
lemony
dry
clean
finish
leaves
a
slightly
puckered
mouthfeel
the
result
of
ageing
in
wood
barrel
is
manifest
in
the
complexity
of
the
smell
and
taste
mostly
brown
body
with
some
reddish
characteristics
head
is
cream
colored
with
fairly
large
bubbles
aroma
is
very
sharp
and
winelike
fruity
but
i
dont
know
if
its
cherries
im
smelling
or
just
something
about
the
beer
that
makes
me
think
cherries
even
with
that
the
fruitiness
is
much
more
subtle
than
in
the
alexander
the
beer
has
stinging
carbonation
that
gradually
numbs
the
palate
theres
a
crisp
tartness
and
again
the
flavor
is
very
winelike
with
some
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
pretty
assertive
in
both
the
nose
and
in
the
flavor
i
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
was
only
around
6
i
could
easily
learn
to
enjoy
this
beer
just
an
amazing
beer
and
really
really
complex
well
balanced
sourness
and
hints
of
cherries
chocolate
and
extremely
smooth
and
refreshing
very
yummy
i
first
had
this
beer
on
the
recommendation
of
the
bartender
at
monks
cafe
in
philadelphia
and
was
immediately
intrigued
the
beer
has
a
tart
sweer
and
sour
character
that
comes
across
in
the
smell
as
soon
as
you
start
pouring
the
glass
one
of
the
most
unique
and
enjoyable
beers
i
have
had
hopefully
it
will
be
available
in
the
states
again
soon
dear
beergod
thank
you
this
is
indeed
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
on
the
planet
an
absolute
must
try
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
serving
type
bottle
verdict
a
nice
flanders
red
ale
from
rodenbach
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palette
but
the
fruit
flavors
are
very
enjoyable
delicate
and
balanced
another
example
of
why
rodenbach
is
easily
the
best
producer
of
flanders
beers
in
the
world
unreal
balance
between
the
sweet
and
sour
neither
is
dominate
outstanding
taste
really
clean
and
crisp
this
is
one
outstanding
brew
o
dark
brooding
and
sexy
tartness
of
the
cranberry
and
raspberry
lend
a
vivid
bite
to
the
primary
note
of
wild
cherry
making
this
a
drink
to
savor
slowly
enjoying
it
as
such
maintains
an
extremely
pleasant
aroma
of
red
consistently
in
the
mouth
a
fantastic
vlaams
rood
unfortunately
mine
was
more
than
a
year
old
therefore
the
fruitiness
of
the
aroma
as
described
by
other
was
strongly
reduced
drink
it
as
you
get
it
much
lighter
beer
than
the
grand
cru
which
is
still
my
favorite
they
make
great
fruit
flavors
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
cranberry
i
think
it
gave
the
beer
a
dry
cranberry
bitterness
in
the
finish
still
a
great
beer
i
dont
think
i
like
this
as
much
as
standard
grand
cru
but
its
tasty
while
this
beer
comes
with
a
significant
tag
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
for
that
special
occasion
i
was
afraid
i
had
held
onto
this
too
long
for
the
fruit
to
really
come
through
luckily
that
is
not
the
case
amazing
fruit
aroma
with
raspberries
leading
the
way
and
cherries
not
far
behind
taste
is
an
absolute
delight
fruity
but
still
with
the
complexity
of
a
good
flanders
red
maybe
a
bit
more
earthiness
and
funk
would
be
beneficial
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
awesome
it
was
quite
expensive
but
if
you
love
fruity
sours
definitely
try
this
out
at
least
once
if
i
saw
it
again
id
pick
up
the
occasional
bottle
heavy
cranberry
lighter
sour
punch
than
expected
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
is
glorious
this
beer
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
in
the
smell
the
cherries
and
cranberries
are
the
most
dominant
in
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
raspberries
in
the
taste
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
tartness
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
super
variation
on
the
style
this
was
pricey
but
worth
it
as
good
or
better
than
the
flagship
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
world
class
and
serves
as
the
standard
against
which
others
should
be
judged
it
is
intense
quite
complex
and
a
brewers
masterpiece
of
balance
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
tart
fruit
raspberries
and
cherries
over
a
slightly
sweet
background
in
the
middle
tartness
gives
a
slight
pucker
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
sour
vinegar
the
raspberry
and
cherry
fruit
flavors
slowly
subside
and
cranberry
comes
to
the
forefront
over
a
caramel
like
sweetness
as
the
finish
approaches
dryness
comes
to
the
forefront
coupled
still
with
a
nice
tart
pucker
and
flavor
in
the
finish
oak
notes
come
to
the
forefront
coupled
with
a
slow
fade
of
tartness
and
slight
sourness
a
dry
pucker
lingers
thanks
to
chuk
at
central
market
for
the
last
bottle
in
austin
pours
up
a
beautiful
ruby
smells
of
insane
amounts
of
the
red
fruits
as
labeled
flavors
of
the
same
fruits
very
intense
nice
and
tart
very
smooth

bodied

i
think
im
about
to
mate
with
amanda
after
this
beaute
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
no
date
on
the
bottle
that
i
could
find
so
i
have
no
idea
how
old
or
what
batch
number
this
is
im
pretty
sure
ive
had
this
bottle
for
about
a
year
if
not
longer
so
it
does
have
some
age
on
it
served
in
a
prairie
teku
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
ruby
redbrown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
the
head
fizzled
away
quickly
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
fruity
sweet
and
tart
the
brew
smells
like
raspberries
cherries
oak
vinegar
lemon
and
a
bit
of
cranberry
the
taste
overall
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
it
tastes
like
raspberries
cherries
both
sweet
and
tart
ones
cranberries
oak
grape
skins
caramel
vinegar
and
a
bit
of
apple
and
lemon
peel
the
tart
flavors
were
subtle
at
first
but
then
got
stronger
as
i
finished
the
bottle
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
soft
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
definitely
worth
buying
if
you
see
it
anywhere

bad

extremely
cranberryforward
would
be
a
perfect
thanksgiving
beer
this
is
basically
new
glarusquality
fruit
beer
with
an
easygoing
belgian
flanders
base
which
is
very
nice
the
fruit
is
allowed
to
shine
through
excellently
especially
enjoyed
the
cranberry
aspect
easygoing
complex
and
excellent
just
amazing
unique
incredibly
special
beer
as
good
as
any
i
can
recall
i
dont
usually
get
too
into
the
flanders
red
type
it
always
seems
more
vinegar
and
acidity
than
yeast
character
and
i
find
it
off
putting
that
its
usually
so
sweet
as
well
as
sour
a
textural
and
flavor
contrast
that
doesnt
often
jive
with
me
this
one
though
is
entirely
different
the
sour
cherries
cranberries
and
raspberries
are
huge

right
from
first
splash
into
my
glass
its
almost
neon
red
pink
clearish
and
heady
delicate
looking
but
really
intensely
colored
the
nose
presents
the
tartness
of
the
fruit
cranberries
leading
the
way
but
all
three
are
easy
to
pick
out
there
is
less
body
and
sweetness
than
i
remember
in
the
grand
cru
and
i
like
that
a
lot
there
is
a
swedish
fish
aroma
mouthwatering
and
candylike
but
not
all
that
sweet
the
fruit
is
super
authentic
and
the
beer
seems
very
mature
there
is
a
bit
of
oak
on
it
too
but
not
heavy
and
sweet
and
really
now
showing
the
usual
vanilla
much
because
of
the
intensity
of
the
fruit
the
fruit
is
right
there
up
front
in
the
taste
but
i
think
i
get
more
cherry
first
more
raspberry
later
the
best
of
both
kriek
and
framboise
here
but
the
finish
is
what
makes
this
special
i
think
it
has
that
malt
vinegar
flavor
of
the
typical
flemish
red
but
its
more
refined
its
really
sour
but
it
carries
on
forever
without
being
shocking
the
finish
is
the
longest
ever
super
puckery
and
not
the
least
bit
sweet
with
the
fruit
tartness
continuing
to
come
in
waves
for
ages
after
the
swallow
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ever
made
in
my
opinion
extremely
memorable
and
different
and
a
model
for
others
to
strive
for
in
terms
of
quality
maybe
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
ever
had
which
is
crazy
to
me
because
as
good
as
grand
cru
is
it
wasnt
a
personal
favorite
at
all
as
good
as
it
gets
huge
thanks
to
my
brother
for
sharing
this

wowee
this
is
a
jawdropping
fruited
sour
come
across
thanks
to
eddy
the
bartender
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
another
fantastic
fantastic
flanders
by
rodenbach
and
finally
a
fruitforward
version
this
easily
can
step
up
and
compete
with
the
best
fruit
lambics
of
the
rest
of
belgium
and
of
new
glarus
full
bodied
yet
quite
dry
and
well
carbonated
ale
overall
an
exceptional
fruited
belgian
sour
worthy
of
much
praise
and
discussion
for
special
occasions
sweet
bottle
from
the
dogz
place
near
pittsburgh
pricey
pours
dark
red
with
some
brownish
hues
and
a
bit
of
light
showing
through
along
with
a
nice
two
finger
off
white
head
with
some
pink
tones
to
it
awesome
aroma
of
cherries
and
raspberries
lots
if
sweet
fruit
here
light
tartness
a
bit
of
oak
flavor
is
plenty
of
sourness
but
not
overbearing
acidity
on
the
tongue
some
oak
here
but
dominated
by
fruit
sweet
raspberries
lots
of
cherries
and
i
assume
the
cranberries
add
a
bit
of
the
tart
tones
here
medium
bodied
with
nearly
spritzy
carbonation
that
mingles
perfectly
with
the
sourness
to
balance
out
all
the
sweet
berries
here
world
class
brew
to
my
mind
one
of
the
most
remarkable
beers
in
the
world
and
probably
the
best
example
of
a
flemish
red
that
i
have
tried
while
i
have
enjoyed
numerous
varieties
the
classic
red
the
grand
cru
the
barrel
aged
vintage
varieties
from
this
brewery
this
has
been
the
most
consistently
satisfying
if
i
had
to
choose
one
beer
to
drink
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
it
as
of
now
that
is
why
this
is
the
only
beer
i
give
a
perfect
5
probably
would
not
purchase
again
at
the
price
23
99
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
for
dessert
seems
very
onenotey
front
to
back
and
way
to
sweet
for
my
liking
would
age
help
ogreat
blend
of
flavors
and
one
of
the
best
flanders
reds
i
have
ever
had
look
forward
to
trying
this
one
with
a
little
age
o
this
one
is
very
sour
but
the
bright
clean
oak
and
fruit
distract
great
sour
drink
so
i
had
just
finished
a
pnc
for
my
bday
and
colored
me
pink
when
i
saw
this
in
the
case
thank
god
for
a
caring
and
understanding
gf
who
said
its
on
me
happy
birthday
was
well
worth
the
review
great
fruits
small
oak
and
just
a
very
good
beer
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
in
body
light
to
medium
in
carbonation
the
beer
itself
is
very
dry
and
leaves
your
mouth
watering
mouth
feel
is
light
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
great
beer
damn
near
perfect
and
i
think
an
improvement
over
the
other
rodenbachs
which
i
love
this
one
has
the
same
sharp
bite
slightly
softened
and
made
more
complex
by
pronounced
but
elegant
wood
and
a
winter
spice
note
probably
from
the
oak
and
the
older
beer
that
plays
up
a
slight
sweet
note
that
contrasts
beautifully
with
the
red
fruit
in
the
sourness
and
the
vinous
notes
i
absolutely
loved
this
version
of
a
classic
great
wonderfully
complex
and
a
real
pleaser
in
every
way
if
i
had
any
criticism
at
all
itd
be
that
i
wanted
a
tad
more
of
a
tart
cranberry
character
93
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
extremely
well
balanced
with
big
sweet
and
tart
berry
flavors
that
balance
each
other
out
really
a
delight
to
sip
on
this
is
very
drinkable
as
well
the
mother
of
all
flemish
beers
incredible
chemistry
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
best
sour
ive
ever
had
prost
ordered
it
not
knowing
what
to
expect
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
excellent
fragrance
current
and
raisin
with
a
balsamic
notes
near
the
end
sour
and
oak
sweetness
great
balance
the
appearance
is
unbelievable
would
love
to
enjoy
it
again
on
a
patio
o
so
much
better
than
i
anticipated
well
worth
the
22
bucks
i
would
buy
again
for
sure
drinkability
is
excellent
extremely
delicious
and
impressively
elegant
lots
of
flavor
but
neither
the
sour
the
sugar
or
the
fruit
are
exaggerated
or
out
of
balance
outstanding
beer
one
of
the
best
750ml
corked
and
caged
and
my
night
is
looking
up
it
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
light
pink
dense
almost
creamy
if
it
werent
so
active
head
smell
wow
cherries
wood
grass
lemons
and
something
almost
cinnamon
the
taste
is
woody
with
a
cherry
aftertaste
somewhere
along
the
way
sugared
oranges
show
up
but
its
not
sweet
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
its
not
sour
at
all
but
just
delightfully
dry
it
has
some
vanilla
in
the
mix
and
just
is
really
interesting
every
time
i
try
to
get
a
hand
on
it
something
else
wells
up
mouthfeel
is
terrific
slick
and
slightly
tingly
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
but
it
doesnt
care
it
has
far
too
much
going
on
to
care
about
my
opinion
very
nice
sort
of
a
cross
breed
between
a
flanders
red
and
a
lambic
just
a
great
beer
o
just
stupendous
so
complex
and
flavorful
t
opens
on
a
sweet
cranberry
note
with
just
a
tug
of
tartness
slowly
fading
into
pure
raspberry
jam
ripe
blueberry
cherry
skin
tannins
and
some
silky
smooth
malt
notes
in
the
back
finish
is
a
touch
dry
with
some
oak
and
lingering
dried
cranberry
and
black
cherry
skin
notes
theres
a
lot
of
sweetness
here
but
its
held
in
check
perfectly
by
some
on
point
carbonation
and
the
nice
drying
finish
could
easily
be
the
best
flanders
red
ive
had
overall
a
truly
outstanding
worldclass
barrelaged
beer
thirstquenching
delicious
overall
very
interesting
and
delicious
belgian
sour
after
finishing
the
bottle
i
saw
that
this
is
a
flanders
red
on
ba
and
that
really
threw
me
off
this
tastes
more
like
a
fruit
lambic
in
a
lot
of
ways
although
the
brown
malts
do
come
across
more
than
say
rosé
de
gambrinus
my
wife
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
trying
this
one
thank
you
eduardo
for
the
lovely
wedding
gift
bigtime
want
knocked
down
right
now
slam
awesome
brew
have
another
in
the
fridge
thanks
for
the
bottle
share
bryan
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
taste
this
beer
is
able
to
destroy
the
stylistic
guidelines
with
pinpoint
accuracy
while
sending
unique
yet
appropriate
flavoring
dancing
over
top
of
it
the
fruit
is
wonderfully
refreshing
and
authentic
matching
the
oak
in
all
of
its
weird
glory
whole
heartedly
the
aroma
is
just
as
nice
but
doesnt
quite
set
you
up
for
the
seriousness
of
the
sip
the
mouthfeel
on
the
other
hand
is
out
of
this
world
with
just
the
right
amount
of
dryness
to
match
the
juiciness
and
puckering
punch
of
the
fruit
grain
and
wood
weve
been
quite
excited
for
this
one
for
a
while
and
oddly
enough
this
is
our
first
taste
of
any
rodenbach
product
despite
the
fact
that
weve
been
accruing
a
vintage
vertical
in
our
cellar
for
the
past
several
years
this
beer
might
be
a
bit
esoteric
for
some
but
for
those
that
can
appreciate
it
it
is
downright
delicious
lighter
side
of
medium
with
some
nice
refreshing
carbonation
that
lightly
pricks
at
your
tongue
before
scrubbing
it
dry
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
i
love
fruitforward
beers
but
the
fruit
additions
in
this
offering
completely
overwhelmed
the
base
beer
and
resulted
in
something
that
was
overtly
sweet
and
rather
onedimensional
if
this
were
merely
a
fruited
ale
i
probably
would
have
given
it
much
better
scores
however
knowing
how
terrific
the
base
beer
is
and
paying
28
for
this
enhanced
version
gives
me
reason
to
knock
it
in
some
aspects
although
most
fruit
beers
are
best
consumed
fresh
this
one
might
actually
benefit
from
some
age
overall
this
was
fantastic
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
very
refreshing
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
dont
have
any
experience
with
this
style
but
im
pretty
sure
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
flanders
red
ale
and
it
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
better
funky
fruit
beers
i
have
had
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
wasnt
overly
sour
a
little
acidic
pretty
smooth
clean
refreshing
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
a
full
bottle
would
be
a
little
too
acidic
for
me
so
i
think
splitting
the
bottle
with
someone
is
the
perfect
amount
and
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
everything
this
beer
didnt
have
any
weak
points
in
my
opinion
and
theres
nothing
i
can
think
that
would
improve
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
expensive
it
is
i
know
its
not
cheap
to
import
these
belgian
beers
but
if
the
price
was
lower
it
wouldnt
be
just
a
special
occasion
beer
i
would
get
this
beer
again
if
it
saw
it
its
very
expensive
but
i
think
its
worth
it
and
it
makes
for
a
great
special
occasion
beer
and
i
would
love
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
loves
those
funky
fruit
beers
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
was
hoping
this
was
going
to
be
good
for
how
much
i
paid
for
it
but
it
ended
up
exceeding
my
expectations
and
it
made
for
a
very
enjoyable
beer
good
job
guys
this
was
a
great
and
special
beer
thanks
for
sending
some
to
the
usa
keep
up
the
awesome
work
overall
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
i
dont
like
to
bring
up
other
beers
in
my
reviews
too
much
but
this
reminds
me
of
a
certain
intense
beer
but
improves
upon
it
everywhere
that
id
have
liked
to
see
it
i
guess
that
when
a
company
does
something
for
200
years
they
do
it
better
than
most
overall
i
could
drink
tons
of
this
stuff
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
slightly
oily
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
such
a
good
idea
by
these
guys
to
throw
some
fruit
in
this
beer
fantastic
beer
i
would
rank
it
among
the
world
class
fruited
lambics
i
have
had
this
is
a
toptier
sour
and
perhaps
the
greatest
achievement
of
the
flemish
red
style
o
pricey
but
well
worth
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
this
is
an
excellent
flanders
red
its
absurdly
fruity
and
inexplicably
clean
im
honestly
surprised
at
how
good
this
is
buy
it
if
you
see
it
has
the
base
of
rodenbach
and
then
enhances
it
with
delicious
fruit
infusions
a
nice
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
odvery
tasty
it
just
stampedes
with
tasty
berry
flavor
with
a
genuine
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
a
pricey
750
but
in
my
opinion
well
worth
a
try
at
least
once
o
a
welldone
step
up
from
the
alreadygreat
grand
cru
too
bad
it
is
so
expensive
great
even
tone
to
this
one
raspberries
are
definitely
there
cherries
are
also
there
bringing
some
sour
fruit
character
also
after
that
its
kind
of
hard
to
tell
if
i
pick
up
cranberries
here
with
all
the
typical
stuff
that
comes
with
the
style
anyways
this
beer
is
awesome
find
me
a
keg
of
it
or
a
river
if
you
please
caractere
rouge
is
a
less
vinegary
example
of
flanders
red
ales
but
is
slightly
more
fruit
forward
i
love
it
that
the
fruits
are
sweet
enough
to
discern
them
from
another
and
not
so
dry
that
they
all
begin
to
taste
alike
that
sweetsoursavory
medley
shows
a
balance
thats
rarely
found
in
sour
ales
overall
really
good
surprising
as
the
focus
is
more
fruit
and
less
tart
but
it
works
tremendously
o
a
very
well
done
sour
worth
try
and
the
25
price
tag
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
not
as
exciting
as
some
new
age
sours
but
wonderfully
fruity
and
balanced
final
thoughts
another
home
run
for
rodenbach
a
perfect
marriage
of
sour
cherries
cranberries
raspberries
and
bacteria
the
lacto
is
present
but
there
is
most
certainly
a
malt
presence
on
the
back
of
the
tongu
nose
is
perfumy
and
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
buy
a
few
more
bottles
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
overall
it
was
ok
but
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
this
one
actually
at
least
in
comparison
the
original
rodenbach
this
was
just
a
little
too
on
the
sour
red
fruit
side
for
me
an
interesting
try
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
rather
sour
cranberry
flavored
beer
then
this
is
definitely
one
to
go
too
o
i
tried
to
be
moderate
in
my
review
as
this
is
not
a
style
i
have
frequented
often
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
superior
ale
and
something
worth
getting
your
hands
on
should
the
opportunity
present
itself
overall
elegant
simplicity
perfect
description
from
kathleen
so
much
fruit
flavour
for
the
style
which
was
a
bit
surprising
considering
the
other
rodenbach
offerings
that
are
heavier
on
the
sweetness
and
caramel
flavours
awesome
stuff
thanks
again
jeff
really
a
gorgeous
beer
bright
pinkish
read
with
a
nice
beigepink
lace
unlike
anything
else
ive
had
from
rodenbach
which
tends
to
be
heavy
on
the
balsamicoak
this
is
much
more
similar
to
something
new
glarus
would
brew
extremely
fruit
forward
cranberry
raspberry
cherry
dominate
the
nose
and
palate
a
little
tart
a
little
sweet
but
a
full
on
ambush
of
flavor
this
was
great
o
the
strong
red
berries
really
made
the
difference
i
love
this
one
thanks
to
simon
for
sharing
the
bottle
o
perfect
drinkability
very
fruity
even
for
a
flanders
red
extremely
balanced
and
pleasant
another
masterpiece
from
rodenbach
the
reveal
rodenbach
caractère
rouge
very
surprised
by
the
reveal
o
one
of
the
best
flander
red
that
i
have
had
the
rating
by
is
correct
and
does
this
beer
justice
the
beer
pours
a
dark
slightly
dull
rusty
brown
that
shines
crimson
in
the
light
and
provides
a
fizzling
pink
head
although
the
head
fades
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
it
leaves
a
thin
blanketinghalo
throughout
drinking
the
nose
is
potently
fruity
with
prominent
notes
of
strawberry
and
cherry
and
celery
followed
by
a
very
refined
oak
acetone
the
taste
is
flanders
red
to
the
max
with
huge
amounts

fruitiness
a
touch
of
caramel
and
wood
its
medium
bodied
effervescent
modestly
dry
and
acidic
fruity
bold
and
downright
drinkable
as
hell
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
for
those
that
enjoy
a
good
flanders
and
have
had
the
rodenbach
predecessors
its
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
actually
overall
just
a
pure
joy
to
drink
the
irony
was
i
was
going
to
buy
a
bottle
of
this
overseas
and
pay
for
the
nose
but
thought
after
i
had
it
i
wouldnt
have
to
now
that
ive
already
done
it
i
want
the
dam
thing
even
more
and
just
may
buy
it
just
so
i
can
have
it
again
cant
stop
thinking
about
it
its
truly
a
winner
overall
i
had
high
expectations
going
into
this
beer
and
wasnt
disappointed
the
elements
of
the
fruit
and
base
beer
work
perfectly
together
without
one
overshadowing
the
other
i
had
to
force
myself
to
sip
this
as
i
easily
could
have
killed
the
whole
bottle
in
no
time
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
o
definitely
drinkable
and
complex
but
at
this
point
the
cherry
sweetness
is
a
bit
out
of
proportion
maybe
with
some
age
the
fruit
will
fade
and
the
bugs
will
do
a
little
more
work
pours
a
hazy
dark
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of

on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart

and
raspberry
vinaigrette
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
fruity
finish
and
a
slight
acidic
quality
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
really
tasty
and
easy

that

and
brings

big
thanks
goes
out
to
cmrillo
for
sharing
this
one
during
the
one
year
anniversary
of
my
wreck
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
crooked
stave
crooked
line
tulip
poured
a
deep
ruby
redorange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
sour
tart
wood
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
tart
cherry
wood
subtle
funk
and
sugar
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
in
typical
rodenbach
fashion
they
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
really
complex
tart
and
sour
all
while
be
refreshing
at
the
same
time
while
there
wasnt
a
huge
amount
of
complexity
going
on
here
it
was
just
the
right
about
in
my
opinion
for
the
style
this
made
it
quite
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
enjoyable
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
you
wont
regret
it
o
it
was
just
a
decent
flanders
i
honestly
would
prefer
alexander
better
and
have
real
fruit
flavor
than
juice
type
taste
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
lots
of
cherries
lots
of
fruit
lots
of
fruit
seriously
this
is
a
cherry
bomb
other
flavors
fight
to
get
through
but
ultimately
fail
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
would
have
been
better
if
it
wasnt
just
a
one
note
beer
not
as
sweet
as
the
redbach
thankfully
overall
i
was
slighlty
underwhelmed
by
the
offering
to
be
honest
i
was
super
pumped
for
it
but
the
sour
profile
and
high
effervescence
made
this
seem
like
a
carbonated
fruit
juice
than
a
flanders
red
ale
base
beer
is
really
mitigated
by
the
sweet
fruity
berry
flavors
with
lower
tartness
than
i
was
expectinghoping
for
maybe
with
time
this
could
develop
into
something
but
right
now
it
is
merely
good
and
not
elite
as
i
was
expecting
overall
a
good
beer
that
we
thoroughly
enjoyed
especially
in
a
hotel
room
after
a
12
hr
beer
festival
lots
of
good
fruit
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
one
though
the
look
and
feel
could
use
some
rethinking
an
enjoyable
brew
id
love
to
have
again
trade
me
more
so
i
can
open
it
with
you
dennoman
cheers
overall
a
nice
fruited
flandersstyle
beer
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
there
isnt
a
lot
to
drink
so
i
guess
thats
not
a
problem
reminds
me
a
lot
of
ocean
spray
or
cranapple
cider
a
fantastic
beer
really
i
wish
it
could
get
some
head
retention
but
it
is
nonetheless
a
very
tasty
beer
and
exceptionally
balanced
a
really
nice
beer
from
rodenbach
that
i
will
have
again
no
doubt
im
going
to
stock
up
on
bottles
as
i
think
this
even
has
additional
room
for
improvement
good
stuff
the
palate
opens
clean
and
sour
with
a
big
bright
cherry
character
super
bright
and
refreshing
a
little
bit
of
a
raspberrylike
character
is
present
too
there
is
a
little
bit
of
acetone
but
it
works
on
the
palate
too
medium
light
in
body
medium
high
in
carbonation
this
beer
is
just
fantastic
pour
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
tart
cherries
funk
yeast
a
bit
of
vinegar
some
sweet
fruits
some
tart
fruit
the
flavor
is
pretty
tart
up
front
with
some
fruity
tartness
and
a
bit
of
acid
the
fruit
comes
in
midway
to
provide
some
sweet
balance
before
a
bit
of
funk
vinegar
and
tannic
oak
step
in
medium
body
with
a
sharp
level
of
carbonation
that
provides
for
a
prickly
mouthfeel
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
its
good
now
but
almost
feels
like
a
few
years
would
do
wonders
to
help
meld
the
flavors
a
bit
this
is
a
medium
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
offering
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
the
hints
of
medicinal
aspect
keeps
it
from
being
stellar
i
am
really
taken
back
by
how
fruity
this
is
and
how
much
it
has
altered
the
base
beer
straight
from
the
pour
it
looks
fruited
and
it
captures
a
fruity
aromatic
quality
that
filled
the
room
we
were
sitting
in
while
enjoying
this
it
was
nice
to
try
it
and
say
i
had
it
but
i
think
i
give
the
nod
to
the
gramd
cru
as
being
what
i
would
rather
spend
my
money
on
maybe
with
some
age
as
the
fruit
mellows
out
my
opinion
might
change
but
asis
this
is
a
fruity
medicinal
bugger
i
could
drink
an
entire
case
of
this
stuff
time
to
trade
for
my
own
bottle
d
awesome
stuff
i
probably
should
have
ordered
more
i
crushed
my
glass
and
filled
it
up
again
before
sharing
the
rest
with
the
sfchicago
hags
nice
to
see
rodenbach
stepping
up
and
not
merely
resting
on
their
laurels
inspiring
the
pour
is
a
lightly
hazed
ruby
color
with
a
pink
head
very
nice
nose
of
berries
cranberry
and
raspberry
are
strong
but
the
cherries
are
not
quite
as
pronounced
a
mild
sweetness
not
all
that
vinegary
the
flavor
has
a
very
strong
raspberry
note
and
a
more
subdued
cherry
and
cranberry
profile
hint
of
red
wine
vinegar
a
definite
sweetness
light
oak
and
must
really
nice
big
thanks
to
jedwards
for
breaking
this
one
out
pours
a
beautiful
raspberry
hue
with
no
head
nose
expresses
raspberries
and
tart
cherries
taste
consistent
with
nose
bold
and
fruity
with
a
slight
tart
quality
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
a
slight
acidity
and
easy
easy
astringency
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
although
not
sure
i
would
classify
it
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
not
overly
sour
very
approachable
to
various
taste
and
theres
some
definite
cellaring
potential
here
id
like
to
score
a
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
couple
years
the
beer
is
a
gorgeous
radiant
dark
ruby
color
like
a
gem
a
thin
pink
head
rests
atop
the
beer
leaving
sparse
lacing
on
the
tulip
the
aroma
is
wild
and
funky
like
a
fruit
lambic
smells
very
sweet
huge
raspberry
presence
similar
to
a
framboise
sweet
and
teeming
with
berry
flavor
balanced
by
a
bit
of
tartness
and
wild
yeast
character
a
great
candidate
for
sharing
as
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
after
a
small
serving
overall
very
tasty
albeit
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
personally
while
not
my
absolute
favorite
offering
from
rodenbach
i
enjoyed
this
recommended
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
it
needs
some
time
to
agemellow
a
bit
so
the
tart
acidity
can
work
itself
out
i
think
the
longterm
potential
for
this
beer
to
be
wonderful
is
very
high
ill
be
curious
to
see
how
batch
2
approx
10k
bottle
production
drinks
compared
to
this
batch
1
900
bottles
overall
impressive
all
around
but
especially
the
fruit
character
beautifully
crafted
beer
dont
expect
a
beatyouoverthehead
sourness
i
gotta
say
the
rodenbachs
killed
it
on
this
particular
day
2
beer
of
the
afternoon
after
alexander
rodenbach
o
an
exceptional
beer
great
stuff
i
love
the
fact
that
they
are
experimenting
at
rodenbach
honestly
i
think
that
they
should
do
more
some
of
the
wierd
stuff
that
they
have
done
over
years
the
has
been
great
vin
de
cereale
alexander
and
i
would
include
this
one
in
that
group
worth
the
try
and
the
extremely
higher
price
tag
by
far
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
i
have
tasted
this
year
from
the
use
of
different
fruits
and
the
wood
aging
epic
such
an
enjoyable
sour
beer
you
can
really
taste
the
flavors
of
the
beer
along
with
a
touch
of
sour
halting
just
before
complete
dryness
the
sweetness
of
malt
provides
a
balancing
malt
character
to
prevent
the
sheer
acidity
from
domination
of
the
palate
its
moderate
and
medium
tone
will
be
the
crutch
for
the
diehard
flanders
fans
but
for
those
just
stepping
into
sour
ales
soulless
will
provide
the
much
needed
comfort
is
this
the
end
all
and
very
best
example
of
the
style
absolutely
not
but
hey
i
like
this
sour
beer
and
it
is
pretty
good
ill
probably
get
this
again
for
sure
a
decent
sour
at
a
really
great
price
thank
you
rivertown
a

a

strain

used

blah
blah
blah
words
im
an
outlier
eric
just
not
my
style
nor
my
taste
bring
on
the
flemish
looks
like
sherry
in
my
glass
after
the
head
quickly
dies
down
decent
flemish
character
on
this
typical
cherries
mild
wood
that
somewhat
sweet
fruit
funk
not
bad
feel
is
slightly
thin
but
that
seems
to
be
a
standard
amongst
american
interpretations
of
this
style
i
am
biased
towards
this
style
but
i
think
it
is
a
good
example
i
appreciate
what
rivertown
is
attempting
to
do
here
in
making
an
affordable
easily
attainable
sour
ale
that
being
said
i
have
brewed
more
styleappropriate
flanders
at
home
by
kettlesouring
the
wort
and
fermenting
with
all
brett
im
disappointed
in
this
and
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
o
its
a
malty
sour
not
bad
im
not
sure
id
get
this
one
again
but
at
least
i
know
what
it
tastes
like
if
someone
asks
still
its
a
nice
addition
to
the
cincy
beer
scene
its
different
than
most
of
the
overly
hoppy
craft
beers
out
now
and
adds
some
variety
at
a
great
price
o
this
is
not
a
stellar
beer
and
is
extremely
tame
for
a
sour
flanders
style
but
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
does
offer
flanders
elements
in
a
restrained
and
pleasant
manner
o
good
but
not
great
version
of
the
style
pours

filtered

8

for
a
six
pack
crisp
delicious
refreshing
i
cant
wait
to
get
an
other
one
tonight
i
dont
understand
the
hate
for
this
beer
i
was
told
that
this
is
a
light
example
of
the
style
yeah
its
not
the
most
complex
at
its
core
and
its
a
bit
thin
but
theres
still
some
nice
sourness
and
barrel
character
certainly
not
the
worst
beer
rivertown
has
brewed
this
one
shouldnt
have
been
kegged
rivertown
its
justnot
even
close
it
tastes
like
the
color
brown
o
my
first
flanders
and
i
can
say
its
not
bad
at
all
actually
really
refreshing
i
give
it
a
recommendation
cheers
this
is
astonishingly
bad
rivertown
should
be
ashamed
cheers
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
a
revelation
fruity
sour
complex
and
extremely
wellbalanced
an
accomplishment
only
downside
is
that
other
beers
dont
taste
as
good
anymore
by
comparison
this
is
the
first
beer
that
ive
ever
given
five
stars
its
perfect
in
every
way
smell
taste
and
balance
this
beer
is
a
super
example
of
the
style
i
use
it
as
a
benchmark
perfectly
blended
mix
of
funkyness
and
acidity

notes
slightly
sweet
with
a
strong
tart
finish
so
much
like
the
monks
flemish
sour
ale
in
taste
and
appearance
i
wonder
if
they
are
not
in
fact
of
the
same
style
instead
of
being
classified
as
an
oud
bruin
o
one
of
my
favorite
sours
its
less
fruity
than
more
wild
ales
and
less
vinegarish
than
other
flanders
reds
sharp
tartness
but
not
extreme
and
excellent
middletoaftertaste
great
on
tap
the
nose
definitely
points
directly
to
the
taste
a
very
pleasing
sour
with
notes
of
tart
blueberry
o
if
wild
cherry
pepsi
grew
up
from
a
quirky
teenager
into
an
eccentric
mad
scientist
this
would
be
the
result
delightfully
flavorful
beverage
that
masterfully
covers
its
alcoholic
notes
with
bold
essence
of
wild
cherry
and
berry
extremely
refreshing
very
delicious
many
flavors
come
through
as
you
sip
great
finish
very
fruit
forward
sour
like
a
produce
market
in
your
moutg
o
this
is
a
great
beer
love
flanders
red
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
amazing
its
on
the
sweeter
end
of
sour
beers
dont
get
many
flanders
style
beers
in
my
part
of
the
world
so
i
was
happy
to
find
this
at
julios
liquors
in
mass
last
time
i
was
in
the
state
pours
a
light
red
head
dissipates
quickly
really
wellbalanced
overall
sour
nose
and
taste
without
being
overwhelming
or
lingering
too
long
o
slightly
drier
than
dutches
making
it
more
much
drinkable
sets
the
standard
for
sours
is
the
flanders
red
secretly
my
favorite
beer
style
i
cant
help
but
smile
as
i
enjoy
one
of
these
is
it
just
the
tart
punch
to
the
face
that
makes
me
look
like
i
am
smiling
so
many
questions
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
duchesse
save
the
interesting
mahogany
hue
when
held
to
the
light
increased
punch
of
the
tart
cherry
flavor
hint
of
vanilla
and
slightly
drier
finish
i
rated
duchesse
very
high
and
this
one
would
be
just
a
bit
higher
what
it
loses
a
bit
in
balance
it
makes
up
for
with
the
intensity
of
flavor
eyeopening
again
i
scored
the
components
high
but
the
overall
package
is
so
much
more
complex
and
gratifying
perfection
in
my
eyes
seek
this
out
asap
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
finest
craft
bar
in
western
md
always
rons
in
hagerstown
this
is
very
fine
sour
red
ale
not
too
much
funky
or
horseblanket
on
the
nose
moderate
sourness
and
some
slight
sweet
complexity
going
in
this
beer
to
help
balance
slightly
not
quite
up
there
with
a
few
other
more
complex
sours
but
still
extremely
well
made
and
enjoyable
definitely
fixed
my
sour
beer
craving
that
has
been
missed
for
several
weeks
will
never
turn
this
one
down
very
good
almost
tastes
like
wine
haha
so
this
is
my
first
time
tasting
this
type
of
beer
still
not
sure
what
to
think
it
pours
a
red
wine
clear
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
not
sure
if
this
is
typical
for
the
type
so
i
will
rate
it
low
for
now
has
a
tart
grape
sour
apple
aroma
very
tart
sour
apple
taste
it
is
good
but
it
can
be
hard
to
finish
the
beer
due
to
the
tartness
there
is
a
tart
aftertaste
but
i
dont
remember
it
being
that
strong
this
is
a
great
sour
thats
not
to
expensive
an
absolute
staple
one
of
the
very
best
readily
available
flanders
reds
on
the
market
always
outstanding
fantastic
stuff
by
far
my
favorite
sour
beer
as
far
as
flanders
are
concerned
i
consider
this
to
be
the
standard
i
bought
this
on
tap
at
the
cafe
bruges
in
carlisle
pa
i
was
immediately
struck
by
its
beautiful
lustrous
dark
red
tint
and
it
smelled
delightfully
of
cheery
and
other
tart
flavors
when
i
tasted
it
i
got
a
strong
almost
vinegarlike
hit
on
my
tongue
followed
by
some
flowery
accents
its
sour
and
good
the
mouthfeel
was
also
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
a
little
carbonation
overall
i
really
like
this
and
i
think
i
really
like
these
brews
in
general
im
going
to
keep
going
back
to
these
belgian
ales
most
definitely
sour
beer
my
tastebuds
are
freaking
out
yes
ill
have
another
overall
this
is
a
sour
for
sure
but
a
little
too
much
sour
with
not
much
else
going
on
would
not
rate
this
world
class
definitely
had
better
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
flanders
red
this
has
a
great
nose
and
straight
forward
tart
flavor
awesome
o
an
honesttogoodness
sour
beer
not
simple
but
purposeful
doesnt
spend
time
on
complexity
when
all
you
want
is
sourness
and
red
fruit
ill
be
searching
for
it
again
on
tap
lovely
flanders
red
great
balance
of
fruit
and
tart
the
sourness
is
pretty
mild
tart
is
a
better
term
than
sour
for
this
beer
just
perfect
for
my
tastes
best
sour
red
in
the
world
hands
down
big
sour
smack
blended
complexity
tangy
finish
leaving
you
wanting
more
the
best
sour
i
have
ever
had
sparkling
sourness
convinces
from
the
first
glance
with
a
tonguedrying
vinous
aspect
among
high
carbonation
it
has
a
gentle
fruity
note
of
overripe
grapes
which
goes
well
with
the
sharp
vinegar
bite
resulting
in
a
very
pleasant
taste
which
reminds
me
of
a
good
mediumbodied
wine
this
brew
has
a
fantastic
complexity
compared
to
its
relatively
low
abv
with
an
intense
dry
sourness
which
gets
especially
recognizable
during
the
finish
which
is
like
the
rest
of
the
beer
just
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
on
tap
at
potent
potables
in
jamestown
nc
very
good
sour
excellent
balance
dark
red
so
dark
i
initially
though
it
was
black
super
super
sour
would
be
better
if
the
acidity
were
dialed
back
a
touch
to
let
the
other
flavors
come
out
a
little
more
on
tap
for
sour
night
at
the
brew
kettle
in
strongsville
ohio
during
cleveland
beer
week
2014
deliciously
sour
and
bright
apple
and
fruity
flavors
with
a
crisp
finish
im
a
huge
sour
fan
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
a
sour
next
to
the
magnificent
reds
from
rodenbach
this
is
probably
my
favorite
flemish
red
although
duchesse
de
bourgogne
by
verhaeghe
comes
close
i
have
been
fortunate
to
have
it
on
tap
numerous
times
at
the
hidden
gem
the
anchor
in
wichita
ks
of
all
places
typical
of
the
style
in
most
respects
although
a
bite
more
tart
and
slightly
more
bitter
and
less
sweet
than
others
dangerously
refreshing
and
delicious
one
could
drink
liters
of
this
if
not
careful
nice
ruby
amber
color
weak
head
with
some
lacing
mostly
clean
aroma
with
tart
fruit
aggressive
acidic
flavor
raspberries
blackberries
and
cranberries
subtle
vinegar
flavor
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
bone
dry
finish
this
beer
is
awesome
totally
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
grab
this
if
you
see
it
cheers
o
love
it
a
wonderful
balanced
fullflavoured
beer
that
doesnt
go
over
the
top
amazing
sour
beer
sour
sweet
sour
thin

feel
the
flavor
is
strong
enough
to
clean
your
palate
when
eating
any
food
even
rich
meals
but
dont
try
another
beer
after
it
numbs
your
taste
buds
after
a
while
awesome
beer
my
new
go
to
sour
beer
certainly
the
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
outside
of
grand

amazing
appearance

just
the

4
5
had
this
at
torst
in
brooklyn
im
hooked
on
sour
beers
now
everything
a
sour
is
suppose
to
be
in
my
estimation
great
tartness
that
lasted
to
the
last
sip
nice
cherry
flavor
mahogany
beer
with
1finger
tan
head
aroma
of
dried
fruits
and
vinegar
taste
is
actually
sour
sharp
slightly
fruity
too
severe
for
the
style
imho
o
very
nice
beer
tons
of
flavor
for
the
low
abv
personally
i
prefer
other
reds
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
or
the
duchesse
which
are
not
quite
as
acidic
nevertheless
an
awesome
beer
that
is
really
refreshing
o
when
i
go
to
the
liquor
store
and
nothing
catches
my
eye
i
always
leave
with
this
4
pack
unfortunately
the
cooler
this
was
kept
in
isnt
functioning
correctly
and
the
beer
is
served
too
warm
for
me
this
is
a
beer
that
does
need
to
be
at
least
somewhat
chilled
this
had
a
great
head
and
lace
had
a
very
aromatic
pungent
aroma
cant
pick
up
some
of
the
finer
qualities
as
theyre
lost
in
the
acidity
that
more
fully
expressed
with
the
warmer
temps
o
this
direct
sour
was
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
and
it
nailed
it
it
is
a
flemish
sour
unlike
some
adult
cherry
sodas
ive
had
from
other
breweries
and
brouwerijs
will
revisit
perhaps
often
d
this
was
a
fantastic
sour
with
juicy
and
delicious
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
ok
but
the
finish
was
ultra
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
should
be
sipped
and
savored
a
true
delight
pours
a
deep

slight

complex
not
too
tart
excellent
starter
beer
if
youre
new
to
sours
o
the
core
of
cuvée
des
jacobins
rouge
is
quite
similar
to
monks
café
and
duchesse
in
that
its
an
amberbased
malt
profile
that
offers
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
mild
dark
stone
fruit
notes
but
the
difference
with
this
beer
is
that
its
sour
like
twice
as
sour
the
other
two
are
more
than
respectable
brews
but
dont
quite
offer
the
sour
kick
seasoned
sour
beer
fans
are
looking
for
theyre
the
training

sours
cuvée
des
jacobins
combines
the
best
of
both
worlds
o
what
better
way
to
celebrate
independence
day
than
with
a
beer
from
the
country
that
brought
you
french
fries
and
knocking
usa
out
of
the
2014
world
cup
i
could
just
savor
this
all
day
naturally
i
need
more
of
this
in
my
life
right
now
in
fact
o
very
tasty
better
than
a
lot
of
american
sours
that
are
harder
to
get
or
much
more
expensive

i
needed

this
is
not

it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
tartly

it

id
love
to
find
this
on

o
i
like
a
nice
tart
sour
and
this
one
delivers
on
that
end
but
the
mildly

taste
i
get
underneath
maybe
even
unsweetened

is
very
enjoyable

sorry
i
know
im
going
against
the
rating
rules
but
sour
beers
arent
the
greatest
brewed
beers
it
can
be
a
bios
opinion
but
i
dont
like
them
especially
when
theyre
rated
in
the
top
250
that
being
said
maybe
ill
appreciate
a
sour
beer
at
some
point
but
as
of
now
i
do
appreciate
the
brewing
and
creation
and
idea
of
them
edit
haha
turned
my
older
sister
onto
it
ooverall
a
great
sour
o
no
expert
with
the
flanders
red
ale
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
and
very
repeatable
tart
and
fresh
bright
and
sweet
a
great
startpoint
for
the
introduction
to
sours
as
it
was
tart
but
also
warming
and
almost
creamy
in
feel
at
times
fans
of
the
cranberry
will
surely
dig
this
ale
excellent
sour
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
red
beer
a
bit
of
carbonation
forms
smells
typical
of
red
flanders
acidic
funky
musky
maybe
some
raspberries
taste
perfect
for
a
red
flanders
sweet
malty
sour
lambics
doing
their
work
it
has
that
bitterness
or
dryness
at
the
end
good
beer
to
drink
possibly
aged
in
barrels
one
of
the
stronger
ones
as
in
taste
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
great
flavors
and
aromas
poured
a
ruddy
cranberry
color
with
a
slight
head
aromas
of
tart
cherries
earth
and
wood
tartness
and
cherry
flavors
are
quite
pronounced
and
dominate
the
flavor
profile
mild
funkiness
and
earthiness
are
slight
and
you
kind
of
have
to
search
for
it
a
good
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
but
the
sourness
wins
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
a
good
example
of
the
style
although
you
really
cant
beat
the
style
defining
rodenbach
in
summary
a
very
tasty
beer
with
a
good
mix
of
the
sweet
and
sour
though
not
everyones
cup
of
tea
with
its
strong
longlived
sour
aftertaste
hats
off
to
the
lcbo
though
for
taking
a
chance
on
selling
this
unusual
style
of
beer
cjr
is
quite
reasonably
priced
at
3
30
per
330
ml
bottle
and
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
style
thats
out
of
the
ordinary
o
really
tasty
sour
though
it
lacks
a
bit
on
depth
it
mostly
only
has
a
tart
fruit
profile
and
not
much
else
could
go
for
a
bit
more
earthy
tones
to
round
out
the
big
lactic
sourness
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
lots
of
tartness
compared
to
rodenbach
grand
cru
where
that
beer
excels
in
barrel
complexity
and
fruity
sweetness
this
has
aggressive
tartness
throughout
overall
an
excellent
easytofind
sour
pricey
but
then
again
all
sours
are
doesnt
always
have
to
be
rare
to
be
good
pours
dark
red
getting
sourness
on
the
nose
it
reminds
me
of
tomato
juice
or
ketchup
and
maybe
some
sweeter
overtones
as
it
warms
slightly
offensive
the
flavor
is
very
well
done
its
tartness
is
muffled
pretty
friendly
sour
apple
definitely
strawberry
or
raspberry
notes
do
not
over
chill
this
the
best
came
out
as
it
warmed
a
bit
o
well
balanced
subtle
complexities
under
a
huge
tart
punch
with
exciting
flavor
changes
from
start
to
finish
i
really
liked
this
beer
wish
it
was
available
in
bombers
12

just
isnt
enough

of
the

ive
had

and
more
appreciation
of
sours
and
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
ive
had

hate
to

20
for
a
4pack
does
deter
me
a
bit
even
though
i
know
sours
are
usually
more
expensive
oh
man
this
is
quite
an
experience
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
but
i
look
forward
to
drink
after
drink
even
though
my
eyes
close
sometimes
at
just
how
sour
it
is
i
enjoyed
this
beer
especially
as
it
warmed
more
but
i
still
didnt
detect
a
lot
of
the
complexities
that
i
would
have
expected
it
was
good
but
not
my
favorite
sour
overall
i
love
this
beer
one
went
down
way
to
quickly
id
love
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
o
this
is
a
perfect
flanders
red
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
who
can
get
it
the
price
may
look
daunting
but
its
worth
it
and
relatively
cheap
for
an
aged
beer
like
this
one
o
not
able
to
surmount
the
acidity
to
really
get
any
of
the
flavors
i
found
in
the
aroma
i
felt
from
the
nose
i
was
going
to
get
more
complexity
this
example
is
a
little
one
dimensional
it
is
rather
enjoyable
none
the
less
with
an
approachable
price
point
i
wouldnt
mind
grabbing
a
few
more
for
the
celler
its
just
not
blowing
my
mind
o
by
far
my
favorite
flanders
red
if
you
are
the
kind
that
likes
the
more
extreme
sours
this
is
for
you
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
quite
intense
and
enjoyable
while
the
light
sweetness
gives
a
good
balance
it
hangs
slightly
in
the
finish
and
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
lean
even
further
in
the
sour
direction
perhaps
a
few
more
months
in
the
bottle
would
round
it
out
nicely
bottom
line
buy
if
at
all
possible
if
you
like
sours
or
reds
or
traditional
flemish
brews
if
anything
above
sounds
unappealing
its
there
in
spades
so
buyer
beware
overall
one
of
the
best
flanders
reds
ive
ever
had
well
balanced
with
great
flavors
going
on
i
think
whoa
was
the
first
thing
that
came
out
of
my
mouth
after
i
had
my
first
sip
really
hits
you
with
sourness
more
sour
than
any
other
sour
beer
ive
tasted
i
get
a
lot
of
tart
apple
and
cherries
up
front
with
a
lingering
sour
aftertaste
enough
sweetness
in
the
middle
to
balance
it
out
the
dryness
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
noticed
its
almost
gone
as
im
writing
this
a
great
price
for
a
sour
o
this
reminds
me
of
new
glarus
enigma
but
with
much
more
acidic
quality
this
is
a
fantastic
flemish
sour
and
worth
the
price
22
a
4
pack
sours
are
still
a
broad
style
im
exploring
and
getting
use
to
with
that
being
said
this
is
most
enjoyable
sour
ive
had
to
date
its
smooth
and
the
sourness
is
perfectly
rendered
what
a
treat
this
is
a
benchmark
flanders
red
ale
we
were
so
fortunate
to
have
it
at
a
great
price
at
the
lcbo
recently
full
of
flavor
and
depth
worth
seeking
out
i
have
had
this
beer
a
lot
this
my
go
to
sour
i
love
it
it
is
never
wrong
sour
is
supple
but
elegant
good
price
you
can
find
it
on
the
regular
no
haze
just
good
old
belgian
sour
please
go
get
yourself
one
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
red
a
stand
out
but
the
sour
makes
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
still
slightly
prefer
rodenbach
grand
cru
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
actually
fairly
simplistic
it
is
satisfying
and
tasty
though
nice
example
of
the
style
and
very
easy
to
drink
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
to
the
style
because
this
one
is
well
balanced
and
doesnt
smack
your
tongue
around
with
tons
of
sourness
most
flemish
sour
ales
have
a
moderate
amount
of
sweetness
but
this
version
was
exceedingly
tart
and
acidic
cuvée
des
jacobins
rouge
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
fruitinfused
american
wild
ale
while
this
might
not
be
the
most
balanced
example
of
the
style
it
is
nevertheless
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
rendition
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger

that
fades

quickly

taste
is
a
little

and
fairly
tart
with
tart
cherries
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
great
sour
very
crisp
its
definitely
a
flanders
red
sour
cherry
red
wine
however
i
really
dont
get
any
oak
or
vanilla
flavors
definitely
not
a
starter
sour
very
complex
and
refreshing
overall
bright
and
exciting
flavours
make
it
an
amazing
sour
but
too
intense
to
have
in
large
quantities
this
is
my
first
venture
into
the
sour
beer
world
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
can
see
how
many
people
find
this
type
so
enjoyable
it
has
me
thinking
about
similarities
between
styles
as
well
as
feel
it
is
similar

others

a

still

for
the
non

drinker
very
good
o
a
great
beer
overall
super
tart
and
sour
but
delicious
and
refreshing
overall
the
sourness
is
intense
at
first
but
certainly
not
acerbic
the
tart
fruit
flavors
are
very
enjoyable
especially
the
dark
cherry
notes
i
think
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
was
that
gentle
sweet
orange
note
at
the
end
overall
an
enjoyable
complex
sour

ale
personally
i
would
split

more
good
but
not
outstanding
o
very
nice
balance
between
acid
and
sweet
interesting
flavours
and
very
drinkable
overall
by
far
my
favorite
sour
and
probably
my
favorite
third
beer
whenever
i
can
find
it
on
tap
get
a
little
tipsy
with
something
else
then
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
cuvée
des
jacobins
rouge
is
a
beer
probably
worth
twice
the
price
i
paid
for
it
while
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
depth
of
the
styles
best
on
the
same
hand
it
has
a
degree
of
approachability
and
refreshment
that
any
increased
intensity
would
compromise
bottom
line
this
is
an
easy
affordable
sour
to
recommend
to
just
about
anyone
flemish
reds
have
never
been
my
favourite
style
but
i
quite
enjoy
this
one
clean
flavours
with
balance
where
its
needed
o
overall
i
loved
this
one
great
sour
qualities
but
a
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
nicely
awesome
beer
a
must
try
d
interesting
brew
one
of
few
flemish
styles
ive
had
the
cherry
sourness
is
nice
but
the
vinegar
is
to
strong
here
overall
the
best
flemish
red
ive
ever
red
loved
this
one
atmosphere
is
excellent
nice
body
decent
head
serviceable
lacing
nose
is
fruity
and
powerful
with
a
bit
of
a
woody
or
earthy
tone
mouth
puckering
sour
fermented
raspberry
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
reviewing
this
one
again
since
its
been
a
few
years
and
i
believe
it
deserves
another
shot
this
poured
out
as
a
vibrant
red
color
with
white
head
on
top
some
light
thin
retention
and
scattered
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
give
off
some
big
oaky
sour
cherry
aromas
the
taste
is
tart
up
front
with
plenty
of
sweet
sour
cherry
flavors
there
is
a
bit
of
oak
and
vanilla
this
beer
finishes
with
a
slight
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
smooth
and
dry
in
the
finish
overall
its
a
very
good
flanders
red
really
glad
to
have
tried
this
again
worth
checking
out
3
75
d
this
is
quite
good
but
a
little
too
vinegarlike
and
not
enough
fruitysour
focused
for
me
additional
dryness
would
be
welcome
od
definitely
a
sour
flemmish
red
not
as
much
sweetness
as
youd
expect
to
balance
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
tasty
and
complex
nice
one
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
based
on
my
experience
with
it
on
tap
luckily
it
didnt
meet
my
low
expectations
and
blew
me
away
great
complexity
very
fruity
up
front
with
some
nice
toasted
oak
complexness
tart
berries
a
hint
of
damp
funk
and
a
nice
finishing
dryness
with
a
tartness
that
lingers
so
tasty
so
complex
so
worth
it
go
buy
some
if
you
can
mouthfeel
light
and
extremely
smooth
when
entering
the
mouth
a
spritz
of
carbonation
quickly
subsides
into
the
sourness
coating
your
tongue
and
leaving
the
back
of
your
throat
tart
and
tingling
overall
this
is
tasty
but
i
feel
as
though
ive
had
better
beers
in
this
style
rodenbach
gc
and
perhaps
petrus
nevertheless
its
definitely
a
nice
one
to
have
around
and
perhaps
a
good
one
to
introduce
nonbeer
folk
to
overall
im
just
starting
to
tread
into
sour
territory
before
this
ive
had
supplication
and
a
few
petrus
sours
this
is
way
up
there
if
you
are
familiar
with
sour
beers
or
if
you
are
new
to
sour
beers
i
would
recommend
this
one
overall
a
really
impressive
beer
its
very
sourtart
but
it
still
allows
for
some
other
nuances
to
come
through
subtle
flavours
can
be
detected
throughout
i
might
even
be
able
to
have
a
few
of
these
which
isnt
something
i
can
say
about
most
sours
o
this
is
not
a
sour
for
the
timid
it
is
very
aggressive
with
big
bold
sourness
and
a
complex
range
of
fruit
and
oak
flavors
a
real
winner
serving
type
bottle
this
is
delicious
but
not
for
beginners
really
takes
the
style
to
a
new
level
away
from
the
more
trivial
straight
up
vinegar
or
far
too
acidic
versions
of
the
style
i
really
love
how
predominant
the
red
and
dark
fruits
are
in
particular
as
well
as
how
well
blended
this
is
the
barrels
these
guys
use
must
be
fabulous
stuff
indeed
with
the
low
abv
complexity
and
refreshing
aspects
this
is
definitely
world
class
stuff
i
should
try
it
in
the
bottle
as
well
as
id
imagine
it
would
be
even
more
puckering
a
must
try
for
fans
of
veteran
sour
enthusiasts
seriously
awesome
beer
and
i
cant
believe
you
can
find
this
stuff
on
the
shelves
regularly
well
at
least
whenever
they
release
a
new
batch
i
believe
this
is
aged
for
about
18
months
in
oak
barrels
and
you
can
definitely
tell
super
complex
tart
dry
layered
completely
drinkable
despite
the
heavy
acidity
and
sharpness
it
provides
the
mouth
top
notch
and
highly
recommended
great
stuff
here
a
topclass
flemish
sour
i
find
myself
drawn
more
and
more
to
the
sour
dry
belgian
fare
and
this
brew
does
the
job
terrifically
certainly
will
stock
up
on
some
of
these
while
i
still
can
o
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
ale
i
was
having
a
difficult
time
putting
the
beer
down
while
writing
the
review
this
small
bottle
sure
was
packing
in
the
sour
and
tart
goodness
i
guess
bottle
size
doesnt
matter
when
in
comes
to
the
amount
of
sour
and
tart
fruits
a
very
good
delicious
flemish
sour
would
i
buy
it
again
i
will
and
in
fact
ive
already
done
that
beautiful
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
small
but
densely
creamy
head
dark
cherry
wood
and
malt
aromas
combine
seamlessly
before
meeting
some
mild
dusty
funk
and
acidic
notes
wow
big
tart
juicy
flavor
sour
fruit
cherry
apple
and
berries
light
spicy
wood
dryness
and
some
sweet
creamy
maltiness
buried
beneath
it
all
not
quite
as
mouthpeeling
astringent
as
some
other
flemish
sours
but
nicely
dry
and
refreshing
lactic
sourness
and
a
medium
bodied
slick
mouthfeel
what
a
treat
too
bad
its
so
hard
to
come
by
around
here
o
nice
looking
beer
with
a
complex
nose
i
knew
there
would
be
a
bit
of
sourness
to
this
but
the
aroma
left
me
vulnerable
to
the
taste
onslaught
after
i
finish
my
sip
i
can
still
pucker
up
simply
from
licking
my
lips
fun
beer
and
though
i
love
my
sours
this
was
reaching
my
threshold
d
a
good
flanders
red
good
drinkability
while
having
a
sizeable
amount
of
sourness
i
recommend
trying
this
if
given
the
opportunity
o
exceptional
i
could
savor
sip
and
enjoy
this
beer
all
day
the
sourness
giving
way
to
the
sweetness
is
so
subtle
yet
so
noticeable
complex
this
is
a
work
of
art
overall
excellent
beer
the
best
flanders
red
i
have
had
overall
this
is
a
solid
a
with
4
5s
pretty
much
all
around
o
great
sour
red
hits
all
the
elements
really
well
very
sour
without
being
over
powering
or
syrupy
o
this
was
one
of
the
first
three
sours
that
started
getting
me
huge
into
craft
overall
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
exemplifies
the
style
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
beer
a
must
try
by
any
sour
fans
new
to
get
some
more
of
these
odelicious
and
beautifully
balanced
really
enjoyed
this
sour
pours
deep
beet
red
no
lacing
and
the
smell
allows
you
to
anticipate
the
sourness
your
taste
buds
will
be
thrown
off
but
in
a
great
way
great
value
will
be
purchasing
more
o
an
amazing
beer
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
drink
this
more
often
fruity
and
tart
in
the
best
ways
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
sours
and
figure
this
may
be
the
best
to
try
again
i
can
see
this
is
an
acquired
taste
and
keep
the
style
in
mind
for
review
cant
say
im
loving
it
but
it
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
o
very
good
flanders
red
has
more
sourness
than
most
for
the
style

d
easily
in
my
top
five
most
drinkable
sours
its
not
the
most
flavorful
but
it
is
perfectly
capable
to
keeping
my
taste
buds
entertained
the
beauty
of
this
beer
is
that
i
keep
wanting
more
well
after
i
finish
my
last
sip
overall
just
a
delightful
tasty
wellcrafted
beer
o
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
for
my
tastes
but
its
a
very
enjoyable
sour
ale
o
not
the
boldest
flanders
out
there
but
it
makes
its
presence
known
in
the
aftertaste
quite
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
im
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
while
not
the
cream
of
the
crop
certainly
an
above
average
flanders
red
that
id
happily
drink
anytime
drink
this
as
i
said
was
the
one
sour
make
me
cough
and
hack
the
whole
way
through
tart
sour
and
lush
i
would
like
to
see
what
a
aged

tastes
like
this
was

fantastic

excellent
beer
and
one
of
the

ive
had
in
the
style
definitely
a
must
try
for
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
sours
on
draft
in
a
ccb
snifter
at
gainesville
house
of
beer
pours

nearly

sour

on

some
pleasant
cream
aroma
here
very
nice
flavor
follows
suit
with
massive
sour
cherry
and
vinegar
but
with
a
beautiful
smooth
and
crisp
finish
easy
drinking
and
relatively
light
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
and
put
it
right
behind
duchesse
and
rodenbach
vintage
good
stuff
o
very
well
balanced
great
depth
great
tartsour
not
unique
just
wellmade
shows
a
balance
between
the
uber
tart
and
lightness
of
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
the
thicker
sweeter
qualities
of
duchesse
o
far
and
away
the
best
flanders
red
ive
ever
had
expensive
at
26
a
4pack
but
completely
worth
it
my
favorite
shelf
sour
beer
o
ive
only
had
3
or
4
flemish
sours
so
far
but
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
recommended
o
wow
this
is
by
far
the
best
flanders
red
i
have
drank
super
sour
yet
underlined
fruit
notes
that
bring
this
all
together
quite
nicely
hops
and
yeast
really
makes
this
better
than
an
average
flanders
that
is
just
straight
sour
get
this
when
you
can
cheers
poured
into
a
flanders
goblet
from
a
33cl
bottle
pours
a
nice
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smell
is
of
some
sour
fruits
the
first
few
sips
are
almost
like
sucking
on
a
lime
its
so
sour
tastes
like
sour
cherries
and
green
apples
delicious
great
carbonation
this
is
in
my
book
one
of
the
best
sours
out
there
definitely
the
best
ive
had
found
this
one
in
san
antonio
during
my
honeymoon
im
excited
to
try
it
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
goblet
code
of
03
on
the
back
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
with
hints
of
read
and
a
smaller
fizzy
short
lived
head
the
smells
are
very
tart
and
vinegary
sour
cherries
brett
some
barnyard
funk
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
feel
is
medium
high
carbonination
the
taste
is
amazing
extremely
tart
sour
almost
overwhelming
but
then
you
get
a
hint
of
sweet
balance
some
vanilla
plenty
of
sour
cherries
i
wish
i
bought
more
of
these
this
is
excellent
one
of
the
finest
sours
ive
had
one
of
the
most
complex
intriguing
and
delicious
beers
ive
had
truly
something
you
could
sip
on
for
hours
and
continuously
discover
new
things
a
favorite
for
sure
terrific
beer
and
a
great
reason
to
try
the
style
overall
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
beer
as
i
had
never
heard
of
it
before
but
i
was
super
pleased
and
surprised
by
the
above
average
complexity
and
flavor
profile
for
a
moderately
priced
shelf
sour
i
am
super
pleased
with
this
and
will
definitely
revisit
this
going
forward
when
i
need
a
sour
fix
and
the
inventory
at
home
is
low
overall
a
great
flanders
red
with
more
sourness
than
most
i
like
that
one
of
the
betterbest
sours
ive
had
great
balance
of
flavors
with
some
nice
complexity
in
the
flavors
that
blend
really
well
truly
fantastic
brew
if
you
see
it
get
it
its
hard
to
think
of
a
beer
that
better
exemplifies
a
sour
ale
however
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
nuance
and
complexity
with
that
said
this
is
still
obviously
a
highclass
brew
that
does
one
thing
extremely
well
near
perfection
to
this
reviewer
i
cannot
wait
but
i
must
to
drink
the
remaining
two
in
my
stock
overall
a
good
beer
and
the
huge
sourness
has
a
refreshing
quality
and
is
an
incitement
to
drink
more
great
drinkability
a
side
effect
perhaps
of
its
relatively
low
complexity
in
flavor
would
definitely
have
again
o
just
a
marvellous
beer
my
wife
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
up
there
with
russian
river
supplication
wow
this
was
lip
smacking
sour
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
more
funky
brett
presence
than
i
expected
my
favorite
flanders
red
this
is
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
i
have
tried
yet
i
rate
it
right
up
there
with
rodenbach
grand
cru
which
i
consider
the
gold
standard
for
this
style
someday
i
shall
have
to
try
a
headtohead
to
more
closely
see
how
they
compare
to
each
other
o
just
cant
get
past
the
ketchup
on
the
finish
feel
like
im
ten
years
old
and
my
mom
put
cherrry
medicine
in
my
ketchup
to
get
me
to
take
it
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
to
dark
reddish
mahogany
amber
thin
fine
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
vinous
aroma
of
cherries
with
light
vinegar
and
wood
flavor
is
intense
cherry
acidic
but
also
sweet
little
malt
presence
finishes
dry
and
sharp
with
a
hint
of
wild
yeast
im
not
detecting
the
oak
from
the
aroma
in
the
taste
light
to
medium
bodied
and
the
mouthfeel
is
good
from
the
combination
of
carbonation
and
the
acidic
nature
of
the
beer
im
not
a
big
sour
beer
fan
but
this
flanders
red
with
its
clearly
defined
and
strong
flavors
is
quite
nice
the
intense
cherry
element
is
very
fresh
tasting
finish
is
a
bit
medicinal
but
the
balance
of
the
flavor
progression
is
great
a
killer
beer
i
tend
to
like
the
more
fruity
beers
so
this
was
a
winner
for
me
great
balance
great
flavors
definitely
check
this
one
out
overall
a
lovely
example
of
the
style
has
all
of
the
right
elements
overall
i
would
rate
this
a
top
level
sour
and
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
overall
very
drinkable
for
a
sour
light
crisp
and
delicious
if
it
were
cheaper
this
would
be
a
regular
beer
of
mine
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
medium
to
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
a
bit
overcarbonated
for
the
weight
of
the
body
but
this
initial
sharpness
dissipates
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
fairly
smooth
enjoyable
mouthfeel
sourness
is
able
to
be
felt
as
it
puckers
the
throat
and
lips
a
bit
and
the
acidity
can
be
felt
on
the
back
of
the
throat
afterwards
finish
is
dry
as
expected
i
was
talking
to
my
local
ommegang
rep
about
rouge
and
lamenting
its
loss
he
told
me
to
try
this
at
its
the
closest
beer
he
knows
of
to
rouge
he
was
right
not
quite
the
same
but
damn
if
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
it
in
the
best
possible
way
bretty
nose
and
pretty
tart
for
a
flanders
red
but
turns
out
to
be
a
classical
example
sour
but
relatively
balanced
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
on
it
tart
cherry
and
maybe
a
faint
trace
of
plum
quite
nice
and
a
good
a
bold
example
of
a
flanders
red
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
to
me
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
ive
not
had
the
chance
to
have
any
rr
or
that
crazy
stuff
people
go
nuts
on
here
for
whats
it
called
candle
poon
i
dont
know
this
stuff
is
amazing
to
me
id
drink
it
every
day
if
i
could
o
not
my
favorite
sour
it
reminds
me
of
ketchup
bit
do
far
everyone
i
have
told
this
looks
at
me
like
i
have
three
heads
i
dont
know
what
it
is
i
think
it
is
a
combination
of
the
sweetness
and
the
vinegar
notes
that
just
seay
my
palate
that
way
i
wish
the
sour
fruit
notes
took
more
of
the
drivers
seat
but
i
seem
to
be
an
acception
to
the
rule
least
in
the
circle
of
people
i
imbibe
sour
beers
with
oi
like
if
youre
into
sours
i
can
safely
suggest
this
o
a
nice
sweetsour
beer
lots
of
fruitberries
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
a
slight
ivory
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
lovely
aromas
of
cranberry
tart
pie
cherries
oak
red
wine
vinegar
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
lots
of
cranberry
oak
and
vanilla
not
as
tart
as
the
nose
may
have
suggested
instead
this
is
gentle
and
smooth
with
a
superb
balance
between
tart
and
sweet
expertly
done
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
with
a
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
flanders
red
this
stand
up
with
some
of
the
best
easily
o
delicious
of
course
ill
get
it
again
overall
really
great
and
love
the
availability
o
one
of
the
best
flanders
red
ales
i
have
had
thus
far
certainly
picking
some
up
when
i
see
it
held
up
to
my
window
this
beer
shines
a
mahoganyred
color
a
small
slightly
off
white
cap
with
tiny
bubbles
sticks
to
the
surface
cherries
vinous
astringent
it
really
does
a
number
on
the
nose
if
you
want
it
to
sweet
sour
and
very
smooth
cherry
juice
and
a
sweet
background
apple
pie
maybe
its
just
delicious
dry
but
not
as
dry
gueze
or
etc
and
its
awesome
lighter
in
body
with
lively
carbonation
that
helps
fill
the
mouth
overall
an
outstanding
flanders
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
will
be
picking
up
a
single
of
this
every
once
in
a
while
a
straight
up
classic
o
a
delicious
flanders
red
you
have
to
appreciate
drying
acids
and
funky
yeast
to
love
this
one
as
it
is
loaded
with
intensity
on
the
palate
d
this
is
a
classic
flemmish
red
with
a
complex
balance
between
the
sweetfruity
and
sourfunky
notes
nicely
done
and
reasonably
drinkable
despite
a
strong
level
of
sourness
overall
this
is
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
i
love
how
it
starts
sour
pretends
it
is
going
to
sweeten
but
doesnt
before
leaving
with
a
dry
finish
my
only
complaint
is
the
6
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
but
it
doesnt
stop
me
from
semi
regularly
buying
one
or
two
find
it
on
tap
a
good
beer
that
fits
the
style
well
a
bit
more
sour
than
i
prefer
but
still
damn
tasty
liked
this
one
a
lot
yeah
for
whatever
reason
i
gett
bbq
out
of
it
so
its
a
winner
automatically
perfect
amount
of
tart
thanks

in
color
slightly
carbonated
with
a

that
disappears
quickly

with

overall
a
well

and
very
refreshing
beer
serve
after
a

the
cooler

a
very
good

goes
down
very
easily
though
it
is
only
5
5
o
an
interesting
beer
my
knowledge
of
sours
is
minimal
so
this
was
a
learning
experience
i
appreciate
the
sweetness
to
counteract
the
sourness
because
this
guy
is
very
sour
a
beer
to
relax
to
damn
gina
girl
thats
all
you
had
to
say
ok
so
this
beer
was
the
shit
its
really
a
flanders
brune
in
my
humble
opinion
but
it
was
strong
and
delicious
i
would
have
guessed
higher
alcohol
because
of
the
complex
richness
of
the
beer
color
of
this
is
reddish
brown
not
brownish
red
very
nice
sour
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thang
if
youre
a
fan
of
sours
and
have
never
tried
this
one
do
not
pass
it
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
at
all
at
6
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
in
my
area
its
not
too
expensive
but
i
could
definitely
could
go
broke
drinking
this
beer
however
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
sours
i
would
steer
clear
of
this
one
because
it
has
a
lot
of
sour
notes
to
it
overall
im
new
to
the
sour
flemish
red
style
but
i
am
enjoying
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
very
high
marks
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
duchess
i
have
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
sour
not
super
mouthpuckering
with
a
nice
depth
in
character
the
barrel
aging
lends
its
flavors
nicely
im
excited
to
see
how
this
one
develops
or
degrades
over
the
years
o
an
excellent
example
of
a
sour
beer
drinkable
and
well
made
o
a
good
really
good
flanders
red
not
my
personal
favorite
perhaps
but
i
wouldnt
pass
another
one
up
a
different
league
of
beer
altogether
here
vast
complexities
yet
all
of
the
usual
tasty
delights
to
get
fixated
on
are
right
there
and
upfront
for
you
to
savor
a
model
flanders
red
without
question
a
rival
to
my
duchesse
and
rodenbach
grand
cru
will
buy
up
as
many
as
i
can
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
like
to
have
a
case
of
in
the
cellar
so
i
could
pull
one
out
and
enjoy
every
now
and
then
good
stuff
overall
really
nice
sour
at
a
decent
price
i
will
drink
this
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
good
sour
t
a
great
sour
punch
in
the
mouth
right
off
the
bat
lots
of
tart
red
cherryred
apple
sourness
with
a
good
lactic
twang
red
currants
lemon
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
on
the
finish
super
drinkable
and
really
delicious
o
a
woodaged
sour
can
go
a
lot
of
ways
but
this
one
seemed
to
be
just
right
in
the
palate
this
rouge
is
a
blend
of
balanced
flavors
that
would
put
a
smile
on
any
sour
fans
face
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
be
trying
out
again
soon
this
is
a
high
caliber
beer
delicate
and
bold
hitting
all
ends
of
the
spectrum
in
between
a
new
entry
to
my
rotation
poured
a
murky
mahogany
red
color
with
a
thin
ringlet
for
a
head

aroma
bready
malts
and
cherries

bit
acetic
which
is
no
surprise
for
the
style
the
taste

to
this

its
surely
not
without
its
charm

its
a
great
beer
for
what
it
isiam
not

fan
of

i

it
fits
the
bill
very
well
if

drink
it
wow
this
is
a
great
flanders
red
so
much
flavor
sensation
packed
into
this
beer
it
almost
needs
an
intermission
one
of
the
best
flanders
reds
ive
had
o
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
would
be
its
there
but
much
of
the
palate
is
mildly
sweet
as
well
dirty
light
brown
head
falls
quickly
enough
that
its
dropped
by
half
by
the
time
i
get
a
picture
distinct
sourness
in
the
nose
along
with
a
sharp
cherry
supported
by
dark
fruit
malt
and
clean
oak
puckering
sourness
fresh
cherry
and
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
the
lingers
pleasantly
acidic
punch
lessens
and
the
oak
expands
as
it
warms
improving
the
balance
assertive
and
well
blended
cuvee
des
jacobinsis
a
classic
of
the
style
o
b
very
interesting
beer
here
pours
a
sensational
deep
daunting
ruby
red
color
with
incredible
richness
and
a
more
than
2
inch
tall
off
white
head
thick
as
whipped
cream
smells
like
sour
cherries
crab
apples
and
funky
yeast
there
is
quite
a
strong
sour
hit
of
vinegar
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
curiously
vinegary
very
tart
cherry
essence
and
some
mild
spice
from
the
yeast
i
find
it
to
be
a
bit
heavy
on
the
vinegar
front
for
me
its
a
way
different
kind
of
sour
than
the
brett
beers
feel
is
good
well
carbonated
with
a
fuller
body
i
think
its
perfect
for
the
complex
and
weird
flavor
overall
not
a
bad
beer
in
fact
a
very
well
crafted
beer
but
too
much
vinegar
sour
dryness
of
flavor
for
me
personally
im
not
sure
id
like
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
pours
a
red
tinted
dark
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
smell
is
mainly
apples
with
a
hint
of
cherry
and
wood
there
is
also
some
vinegar
in
there
too
it
tastes
sweet
and
sour
with
lots
of
cherry
and
vinegar
with
some
hints
of
fresh
green
apple
the
beer
is
thick
with
low
carbonation
and
a
tangy
dry
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
tried
reddish
copper
pour
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
a
touch
of
sulfur
vinegar
and
some
modest
sweetness
the
taste
paints
a
different
picture
with
ripe
tart
cherries
a
little
woodiness
and
very
modest
sour
bite
it
wouldnt
be
a
real
sour
without
a
slight
stomach
ache
but
it
burns
so
good
this
beer
is
an
incredibly
modest
flanders
and
i
can
see
why
its
so
highly
rated
so
3
33
12oz
i
must
be
in
heaven
its
something
i
cant
wait
to
grab
in
bottles
what
a
great
find
if
youre
a
sour
patch
kid
this
brew
is
for
you
a
must
try
im
anxious
to
see
where
this
goes
with
some
age
o
sours
are
not
my
thing
as
sours
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
so
i
dont
want
to
rate
it
poorly
the
flavor
hits
the
palate
with
both
sour
tartness
and
sweet
maltiness
and
what
a
glorious
balance
it
is
cherries
are
luscious
and
juicy
at
first
but
grip
the
sides
of
the
palate
with
a
sharp
tart
bite
very
much
like
sour
cherry
pie
with
the
crust
included
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
oak
barrels
flash
in
the
middle
before
the
finish
of
dry
crisp
sourness
although
rouge
is
a
sipper
it
never
once
tires
the
tongue
very
drinkable
and
the
tart
medium
body
is
perfectly
carbonated
im
exuberant
to
have
this
sour
beer
distributed
in
texas
and
the
price
point
makes
it
all
the
sweeter
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
thin
edging
which
leaves
strands
of
sticky
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faint
and
is
of
vanilla
cherry
and
faint
oaky
notes
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
big
cherry
vanilla
taste
which
gives
way
to
a
great
sourness
there
is
also
notes
of
oakiness
and
spices
when
you
let
in
play
on
the
tongue
almost
like
a
red
wine
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
aroma
was
hard
to
get
to
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
very
good
the
taste
was
well
crafted
with
a
nice
complexity
and
smoothness
d
overall
this
is
a
world
class
and
highly
drinkable
ale
i
will
seek
this
out
again

im
impressed
to
say
the
least
a
fine
example
of
the
flanders
red
ale
if
i
may
so
inexperiencedly
may
say
so
amazing
flavor
cascading
and
complex
just
as
the
label
mentions
this
really
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
duchess
but
more
fruity
i
thought
duchess
was
the
fruitiest
flanders
red
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
i
think
id
rather
have
something
that
doesnt
taste
so
fruit
juiceish
and
more
beerish
to
be
honest
it
was
interesting
but
maybe
a
bit
young
i
know
the
alcohol
content
suggests
it
shouldnt
be
aged
but
id
like
to
see
what
happens
to
this
beer
in
a
year
or
two
im
thinking
the
sweet
juice
flavors
might
take
a
backseat
to
some
other
complexities
that
would
develop
this
bottle
was
a
bit
pricey
but
id
definitely
go
back
to
it
again
the
jacobins
is
not
as
bold
as
a
la
folie
but
the
flavors
are
much
more
balanced
and
subtle
very
solid
beer
body
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
to
a
little
thin
crisp
and
clean
finishing
very
refreshing
and
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
food
that
needs
a
little
cutting
through
rich
cheeses
spicy
asian
cuisines
etc
overall
maybe
my
fav
flanders
red
i
typically
dont
like
the
style
because
of
the
maltyness
but
this
one
is
great
because
its
more
dry
ill
be
getting
this
one
in
the
future
for
sure
this
is
a
great
flanders
red
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
another
a
o
a
little
rough
on
the
finish
but
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
and
does
a
great
job
fitting
into
its
style
sometimes
beers
try
to
be
what
they
are
not
and
these
guys
know
what
they
are
good
at
overall
i
find
no
fault
with
this
beer
i
could
drink
it
and
drink
it
low
abv
as
well
making
this
an
extremely
sessionable
beer
if
you
like
sours
get
this
now
o
wonderful
beer
overall
and
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
belgium
sour
should
be
a
nice
flanders
red
ale
i
find
this
style
to
be
quite
solid
overall
seems
like
these
guys
know
what
they
are
doing
great
balance
of
everything
fruit
and
sour
o
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
beer
it
was
very
sour
and
tart
very
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
have
this
one
an
excellent
fruity
sour
definitely
heavy
on
the
sour
but
theres
a
lot
else
going
on
in
this
beer
that
i
really
like
the
combination
of
fruit
sour
and
bubbly
dry
mouthfeel
make
for
a
great
beer
experience
overall
well
tickle
me
pink
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
be
sure
i
am
not
a
flanders
fan
at
all
and
this
one
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
will
for
sure
pick
some
more
up
at
my
local
store
recommended
d
very
impressed
with
this
one
has
all
the
good
qualities
of
this
style
and
manages
to
keep
them
all
in
perfect
harmony

one
of
the
better
flanders

that
ive
had
this

well

as
a

and
for
contemplation
presented
in
a
fisheye
glass
that
fits
the

well
other
than

this
is
a

that
i
never
heard
of
before
seeing
it
on
the
shelf
m0medium

very
flavorful
medium

with
great

this
beer
is
as
slick
as
it
is
sour
the
body
is
very
accessible
and
definitely
smooth
but
isnt
exactly
a
thirstquencher
the
carbonation
is
slightly
fizzy
and
prickly
when
held
in
the
mouth
but
really
foams
up
in
the
swallow
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
makes
me
want
more
overall
this
is
a
bomb
sour
that
has
a
great
balance
to
it
glad
its
in
bottles
finally
this
beer
is
more
of
a
slow
sipper
than
some
other
flemish
sours
due
to
its
extreme
tartness
but
very
refreshing
nonetheless
extremely
enjoyable
and
complex

d
a
must
try
for
any

sour
fanatic
and
a
fantastic
representation

this
is
just
an

i
always
welcome

that
does
not

bank
either
recently
learned
more
about
sour
beers
after
a
california
vacation
and
sampling
some
rrs
and
the
like
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
in
a
little
tulip

pours
a
dark
ruby

great
whif

thatll
nock
your

youre
hit
with
the
wonderful
sweet

definitely
taste
the
cherry
as
well
can
smell
vinegar
for
anyone
who
has
never
had
a
sour
or
wants
to
explore
them
this
is
a
great
one
to
try
first
o
very
solid
complex
flavors
but
goes
down
very
smooth
i
dont
typically
like
this
style
but
this
was
very
delicious
i
went
into
this
beer
with
no
real
expectations
this
was
truly
an
impressive
beer
tremendous
amount
of
complexity
in
the
nose
is
followed
by
an
assertive
and
impressive
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
highly
enjoyable
to
keep
it
short
this
is
probably
the
best
flanders
red
ive
ever
had
oude
tart
can
give
it
a
good
run
for
its
money
though
flanders
is
my
favorite
style
as
well
so
ive
tasted
a
few
in
my
life
its
just
outstanding
and
only
better
thats
it
now
widely
available
year
round
and
only
22
per
4
pack
i
love
flemish
sours
and
oud
bruins
this
was
top
notch
fantastic
i
thought
one
bottle
would
suffice
but
now
i
want
more
to
the
liquor
store
i
go
tomorrow
that
is
if
youre
interested
in
giving
this
novelty
a
go
pairing
it
with
food
is
mandatory
or
even
pour
some
into
a
glass
with
a
russian
imperial
stout
overall
a
nice
dryer
sour
it
has
lots
of
sour
cherry
flavor
and
some
nice

rip
the
enamel
off

your
teeth
sour
just
fruity
sour
goodness
o
all
around
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
i
could
imagine
drinking
an
entire
bottle
of
this
alone
and
think
it
will
age
considerably
well
definitely
something
i
will
seek
out
again
in
the
future
o
edging
out
monks
cafe
as
my
favorite
flanders
red
cuvee
des
jacobins
rouge
exemplifies
the
ideal
balance
in
sours
of
this
nature
its
really
a
treat
to
have
them
finally
brought
around
here
and
even
one
beer
into
the
4
pack
i
feel
that
i
got
my
moneys
worth
out

the
somewhat
steep

this
brew
blew
me
away
hands
down
the
best
flanders
red
i
have
ever
had
squashes
oude
tart
also
just
found
out
this
brewery
helped
brew
ommegang
rouge
no
wonder
it
is
rated
so
high
seek
this
brew
out
it
is
the
real
deal
o
a
fantastic
beer
worth
trying
if
you
havent
had
it
best
sour
to
date
that
i
have
tried
o
very
nice
beer
more
acidic
than
sour
but
still
a
fantastic
beer
try
it
if
you
see
it
o
amazing
and
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
regularly
if
it
was
significantly
easier
to
procure
love
the
intensity
of
the
sourness
and
the
complexity
of
the
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
sourness
it
was
so
tart
and
so
delicious
the
musk
and
funk
comes
through
insanely
well
in
the
nose
and
doesnt
disappoint
the
feel
is
also
something
to
brag
about
this
beer
goes
close
to
being
over
the
top
but
never
overwhelms
the
drink
this
was
a
true
treat
overall
about
as
perfect
example
of
the
traditional
red
ales
in
flanders
as
you
will
ever
find
sip
and
savor
this
one
its
hard
to
believe
i
hadnt
heard
of
this
fine
beer
before
although
im
still
fairly
new
to
the
style
going
from
one
historical
reference
to
another
this
one
pours

the
nose
comprises

the
taste
holds
notes
of
tomato
red
vinegar
black
pepper
raisins
toffee
deep
cherry
light
oak
and
hot
cinnamon
it
all
comes
together
very
well
without
coming
across
as
abrasive
or
stinging
the
body
is
a
slight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
tasty
flanders

one
of
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
style
ive
yet
encountered

a

great
like
an
upgraded

mouthfeel
is
great
too
considering
its
style
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
my
new
favorite
of
its
type
o
wow
for
such
an
incredible
beer
you
dont
hear
much
talk
about
cuvee
des
jacobins
and
there
are
plenty
of
reviews
to
affirm
its
impressiveness
this
is
one
fine
brew
d
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
that
ive
had
so
far
really
tasty
good
tartness
and
nice
balancing
characteristics
that
dont
dominate
or
even
begin
to
overwhelm
id
love
to
get
another
growler
or
bottle
of
this

and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
tart
and
sweet
cherries
vinegar
oak
dark
fruit
and
some
sugar
even
though
the
tart
flavors
are
stronger
the
sweet
ones
are
still
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
i
think
its
a
good
brew
i
liked
it
4
99
a
bottle
o
this
is
a
near
excellent
flanders
red
ale
though
i
feel
that
in
terms
of
depth
it
does
not
compare
to
any
of
the
authentic
rodenbach
offerings
still
it
is
good
and
is
yet
another
step
in
the
right
direction
for
brouwerij
bockor
hopefully
ill
get
the
opportunity
to
try
this
again
in
the
near
future
on
tap
at
churchkey
poured
into
a
sampler
glass
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
mostly
lasting
frothy
light
brown
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing

to
heavy
sour
tart

and

dark

flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
sour
dark

finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
do
i
could
drink
this
every
day
if
only
this
beer
was
sold
by
the
bottle
where
i
live
its
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
it
would
be
one
of
my
regulars
if
i
could
have
it
as
such
dark
rusty
red
solid
finger
of
beige
head
sour
cherry
with
hints
of
leather
and
tobacco
flavors
are
similar
to
the
nose
the
sour
cherry
is
the
most
dominating
however
hints
of
leather
caramel
coffee
and
tobacco
come
through
medium
creamy
body
great
all
day
sour
for
my
money
every
time
i
go
somewhere
that
has
this
i
end
up
drinking
several
glasses
cant
wait
for
bottles
to
hit
the
states
o
somewhat
harder
beer
to
locate
but
quite
enjoyable
o
nice
to
try
a
flanders
without
the
heartburn
i
really
enjoyed
this
o
this
was
a
great
drink
a
bit
of
a
sipper
at
first
even
for
me
but
the
sweetness
really
hangs
on
in
the
finish
and
in
my
mind
after
each
sip
drinkability
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
in
an
evening
probably
as
a
first
beer
it
was
very
approachable
had
substantial
complexity
and
purity
and
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
definitely
a
big
wow
factor
here
but
once
you
get
used
to
the
sourness
the
flavors
really
start
to
pop
out
taste
was
some
nice
sweetsour
cherry
but
overly
tart
and
sour
lightly
woody
with
finish
of
candy
and
grain
but
tended
to
be
too
tartsour
an
element
that
soon
dominated
all
else
making
it
onedimensional
and
eventually
tiresome
d
very
drinkable
nice
complex
and
rich
sourness
and
sweetness
o
this
was
a
very
delicious
flanders
beer
one
of
my
favorites
in
this
style
definately
would
have
on
tap
again
odwhat
a
great
flanders
red
i
love
how
intensely
sour
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
very
very
tasty
happy
to
have
had
a
glass
taste
is
very
tart
with
little
to
no
carbonation
i
am
not
a
sour
fan
however
i
have
had
quite
a
few
because
i
have
friends
that
keep
trying
to
convert
me
to
the
sour
side
that
said
i
like
this
one
very
tart
but
the
fruit
sweetness
balances
it
out
a
pretty
good
beer
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
a
very
big
surprise
to
me
nice
mouthfeel
prickly
carbonation
and
smooth
nice
dry
finish
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
nice
acidic
bite
to
it
very
good
feel
as
well
this
is
a
real
quality
sour
and
gives
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
at
first
it
is
nice
and
sharp
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
i
was
not
enjoying
it
as
much
through
the
2nd
half
of
the
glass
as
it
got
warm
it
got
less
enjoyable
good
winelike
fruit
qualities
on
the
nose
with
a
great
balance
of
fruit
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
tongue
plenty
of
drying
and
puckering
moutfeel
as
well
a
well
rounded
flanders
red
as
it
went
on
i
found
this
to
be
quite
a
chore
to
drink
probably
still
not
quite
my
thing
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
beer
again
its
truly
a
memorable
pour
being
new
to
sours
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
it
over
and
over
etc
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
and
it
was
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
salty
food
overall
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
the
moment
i
have
the
chance
really
wonderful
stuff
deep
and
dark
red
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
came
up
to
a
height
of
around
two
inches
before
settling
back
down
and
leaving
tons
of
lace
all
over
the
sides
and
bottom
of
the
glass
while
never
really
falling
much
below
the
one
inch
level
the
aroma
was
lightly
tart
sour
cherries
hints
of
earthy
and
spicy
notes
and
even
a
touch
of
what
seemed
like
brown
sugar
or
something
along
those
lines
really
very
well
done
and
quite
complex
the
flavor
was
a
little
less
tart
then
what
i
would
have
liked
but
i
have
to
admit
was
still
done
very
well
rich
and
full
it
was
never
flat
or
boring
and
i
have
to
admit
i
found
myself
returning
back
great
balance
of
acidic
sour
and
sweet
fruit
flavors
a
delicious
and
classic
example
of
the
styledisappointed
i
couldnt
pull
off
more
aroma
from
this
one
d
one
if
if
not
the
best
flanders
red
ales
red
i
have
had
super
sour
and
nice
vinegar
flavors
overall
impression
very
complexed
sour
and
gives
the
flanders
red
ale
style
a
good
name
such
a
huge
amount
of
yeast
in
this
beer
it
was
crazy
when
i
received
my
glass
fantastic
ale
once
again
najas
o
i
think
cubee
des
jacobins
douge
is
avery
bright
lively
flanders
sour
alea
pleasure
to
drink
on
a
friday
afternoon
when
i
first
had
this
a
few
years
ago
i
actually
couldnt
finish
this
complete
as
the
tartness
was
a
bit
much
for
meeven
for
the
style
which
is
something
i
thought
i
liked
it
actually
started
to
hurt
my
stomach
but
upon
having
again
now
it
was
delicious
and
not
a
problem
to
drink
maybe
my
palate
has
changed
or
maybe
the
first
pour
years
ago
was
more
sour
somehow
anyway
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
sour
flemish
reds
overall
a
solid
sour
i
was
surprised
at
how
tart
it
is
really
enjoyed
this
one
ill
definitely
order
it
again
should
i
happen
to
see
it
cuvee
des
jacobins
rouge
pours
a
deep
brown
with
significant
cherry
highlights
when
the
beer
is
backlit
theres
a
thin
bit
of
dark
cream
colored
foam
that
tops
the
beer
the
nose
is
about
what
one
might
anticipate
from
the
style
theres
a
definite
acidic
presence
in
the
nose
thats
counterbalanced
by
a
cherry
pit
aroma
that
nicely
displays
both
some
fruity
notes
and
woody
ones
as
well
i
just
wish
that
those
aromas
would
have
stood
out
more
against
the
sour
aspect
of
the
nose
cherry
fruitiness
definitely
gains
prominence
to
balance
the
vinegary
nature
of
the
beer
but
at
the
expense
of
that
nice
subtle
oak
presence
that
is
in
the
aroma
the
body
is
nice
and
light
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
overdone
and
is
distracting
at
times
overall
a
solidly
brewed
flanders
red
ale
though
i
still
havent
found
one
that
quite
measures
up
to
rodenbach
grand
cru
lighter
body
good
feel
from
the
carbonation
very
nice
for
the
style
i
just
had
this
on
draft
at
always
rons
in
hagerstown
md
the
beer
had
a
very
nice
bronzy
red
color
with
a
nice
opaque
head
you
could
tell
from
the
smell
that
this
beer
was
going
to
make
you
pucker
in
a
good
way
the
taste
was
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
the
sourness
was
immediately
apparent
but
their
were
some
other
nice
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
fresh
bread
it
had
a
very
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
that
made
it
feel
very
refreshing
despite
the
beautiful
tartness
if
you
dig
sour
beers
this
is
one
to
drink
on
tap
at
brugge
in
indianapolis
for
sour
night
it
arrived
looking
like
a
coca
cola
without
carbonation
it
smells
of
sour
and
tart
cherries
granny
smith
apples
and
pears
its
very
interesting
yet
pleasant
the
flavors
too
are
heavy
on
the
cherries
and
sour
apples
its
very
nice
the
sourness
is
very
well
meshed
with
the
fruity
sweet
finish
it
drinks
well
and
is
definitely
worth
trying
again
this
is
a
fine
beer
as
with
the
rouge
the
beer
is
like
a
vinegary
and
lactic
acidy
version
of
a
dr
pepper
with
some
beer
style
carbonation
and
characteristics
added
in
for
good
measure
the
flavor
is
truly
remarkable
and
unique
it
is
something
i
would
definitely
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
o
really
nice
for
the
style
maybe
a
bit
too
puckering
for
the
style
but
that
is
just
my
personal
preference
o
loved
this
on
tap
it
was
sweet
and
tart
a
treat
to
drink
sweet
tasting
with
loads
of
cherry
flavor
nice
sour
bite
with
a
lasting
feeling
of
acidic
etching
on
my
enamel
pretty
much
spoton
for
the
style
maybe
a
bit
too
much
vinegar
for
my
tastes
but
it
fits
the
flanders
red
bill
light
carbonation
and
low
abv
make
this
easy
to
pound
but
i
kept
it
at
a
leisurely
nursing
speed
recommended
never
had
a
flanders
this
intense
in
terms
of
its
lactic
sourness
a
nice
development
can
really
seem
like
you
get
the
gritty
red
wine
tannins
up
in
this
one
as
well
but
the
body
is
so
light
not
murky
brown
alesque
that
some
lesser
examples
in
the
style
will
have
very
clean
takes
on
its
own
green
appleness
later
clean
and
complex
how
did
they
do
it
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
there
is
raspberries
to
this
one
as
well
the
color
is
bright
enough
reminscient
of
cantillons
rose
de
gambrinus
overall
this
really
connected
with
what
i
was
after
at
the
moment
the
combination
of
dark
fruits
and
a
fire
hose
blast
of
sour
really
rocked
my
palate
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
that
seems
to
have
an
interesting
mix
of
good
qualities
not
aggressive
and
an
easy
drinking
abv
to
go
along
with
it
overall
i
was
really
happy
with
it
overall
a
very
nice
and
smooth
sour
beer
the
balance
is
quite
nice
as
well
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
i
like
my
sours
on
the
extreme
side
and
this
beer
definitely
delivers
i
only
had
one
glass
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
that
in
one
session
i
feel
like
a
little
goes
a
long
way
but
i
sure
do
enjoy
a
little
overall
very
very
good
overall
very
nice
quenching
would
be
an
apt
description
nice
depth
of
flavors
and
tartness
level
to
remain
a
contemplative
beer
while
still
being
easydrinking
paired
perfectly
with
my
belgian
frites
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
doppelgänger
for
picking
this
one
up
at
gbx
and
sharing
with
me
this
past
weekend
served
from
growler
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
a
dark
yellowish
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
funk
and
a
nice
floral
followthrough
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
damn
good
brew
for
the
abv
on
this
one
it
wasnt
overly
easy
to
drink
large
quantities
of
this
one
surprisingly
i
did
manage
to
knock
out
half
a
growler
in
around
an
hour
though
the
floral
followthrough
was
quite
refreshing
on
the
palate
and
seemed
to
wake
it
up
for
your
next
sip
pretty
nice
aroma
and
flavors
going
on
here
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
as
it
was
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
well
done
flanders
red
ale
that
retains
just
enough
malt
character
to
add
balance
and
complexity
to
the
sourness
where
vinegar
and
cidery
overtones
are
a
general
flaw
the
basalmic
and
fresh
crabapple
sturdiness
is
as
much
an
asset
as
a
deterant
in
this
classic
example
o
very
good
ale
and
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
can
obtain
it
you
can
almost
always
expect
a
flanders
red
to
be
a
treat
and
cuvée
des
jacobins
is
another
example
you
can
put
on
that
list
an
hour
later
i
can
still
feel
the
woody
sourness
what
a
great
vinegar
this
would
make
had
a
tulip
glass
at
the
pizza
port
in
ocean
beach
san
diego
o
a
refreshing
drink
might
be
too
sour
for
some
i
would
try
again
o
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
sour
beers
drinkability
is
not
very
high
from
a
sessionability
perspective
the
sourness
here
is
mouthwatering
i
love
it
but
i
cant
drink
it
fast
or
even
more
then
one
a
session
but
oh
that
one
wow
pain
is
pleasure
although
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
this
type
of
beer
the
flavor
is
very
potent
and
a
little
goes
a
long
way
but
its
very
good
i
would
order
this
beer
again
if
i
had
the
chance
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
a
very
good
sour
dark
reddish
body
with
no

simplisticsimply
very
sour

a
little

balanced
by
some

medium
mouthfeel
though
some
fruitness
as
if
the
skins
of
the
cherry
there
some
lace
dots
i
cannot
pass
up
this
style
suitably
carbonated
this
is
a
very
balanced
flemish
red
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
great
drinkability
and
flavor
left
me
craving
more
a
great

you
can

this
is
a
very

can

possibly
the
best
flanders
red
ive
ever
had
or
is
it
an
unblended

there
was
a

some

it
goes

dark

a
touch

and
some
really
nice

as
well
as
just
a
hint
of

pie
hard
to
explain
what
i
mean
by
clean
or
pure
here
but
the
funk
seems
unadulteratedly
natural
taste
is
balance
and
harmony
of
all
of
the
above
with
sweet
and
sour
at
near
perfect
levels
medium
body
is
soft
and
silky
with
enough
pucker
power
to
make
me
salivate
and
nowhere
near
cloying
or
sticky
just
seems
to
go
down
sooo
easily
and
way
too
quickly
flavors
explode
on
the
palate
to
be
wiped
clean
by
acid
and
mild
carbonation
truly
a
great
experience
amazing
beer
from
my
experience
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
flander
red
its
almost
like
drinkable
vinegar
which
sounds
weird
but
once
your
palate
has
adjusted
is
completely
addictive
d
this
is
a
really
delicious
flanders
red
ale
glad
i
found
this
one
on
tap
taste
is
delicious
refreshing
dry
sour
cheries
mouthfeel
is
nice
very
puckering
and
nice
carbonation
mmmm
d
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
the
full
tartness
is
very
pleasant
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
tart
and
fruit
flavors
with
the
oak
offering
good
support
this
beer
goes
down
fast
and
so
does
the
next
glass
on
tap
at
toronado
in
san
francisco
we
dont
have
many
sours
in
ontario
so
i
made
sure
to
make
my
way
through
every
sour
on
their
tap
list
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
with
offwhite
head
the
smell
was
both
sweet
and
sour
with
cherry
and
raspberry
i
think
nice
combination
of
sweet
and
sour
in
the
flavour
smooth
mouthfeel
very
nice
beer
overall
very
tasty
delicious
beer
at
much
cheaper
than
most
sourflemmish
beers
very
drinkable
this
is
a
delicious
flanders
red
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
having
another
is
its
high
price
tag
at
8glass
i
have
to
consume
it
as
a
once
in
awhile
treat
rather
than
an
everyday
guzzler
d
first
time
trying
this
style
and
i
was
pleasently
surprised
i
found
it
refreshing
and
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
im
on
snifter
2
as
we
type
this
stuff
is
truly
irresistible
pours
a
nice
cherry
red
with
a
bit
of
brown
as
well
nose
brings
forward
a
good
deal
of
sourness
as
well
as
some
cherries
and
oak
a
bit
of
an
acetic
character
the
taste
is
vinegar
cherry
oak
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
great
creamy
mouthfeel
drinks
quite
well
although
the
acetic
character
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
after
awhile
came
out
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
retained
itself
nicely
and
left
some
lacing
deep
garnetruby
body
with
lighter
tinted
edges
strong
vinegar
scent
but
i
can
clearly
make
out
cherries
wood
and
grandpas
old
coat
must
smells
tastes
of
sour
cherries
which
give
way
to
funky
yeast
and
grainy
malts
with
a
gently
lingering
aftertaste
of
cherry
now
sweet
and
wood
chip
flavors
dry
crisp
and
clean
with
a
light
body
and
fair
carbonation
extremely
refreshing
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wish
were
bottled
for
sure
my
first
flanders
red
and
by
the
looks
of
it
i
got
my
cherry
popped
by
one
of
the
best
eh
not
my
cup
of
tea
normally
but
pretty
good
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
an
excellent
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
a
very
nice
sour
yeast
character
the
taste
is
sensational
it
has
a
very
aggressive
sourness
that
hits
you
hard
up
front
and
leaves
you
puckering
in
the
finish
the
malt
character
is
great
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
with
some
subtle
roasted
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
perfect
flanders
ale
what
a
work
of
art
d
i
do
enjoy
my
sour
and
this
is
a
good
one
im
ready
to
get
some
probiotics
up
in
me
pours
a
deep
amber
with
creamy
dense
head
aroma
of
citric
acid
with
strong
sour
cherry
presence
sour
cherry
carries
into
the
taste
and
is
joined
by
tart
blackberry
and
granny
smith
apple
lactic
acid
comes
on
strong
with
an
astringent
puckerieness
leaves
my
mouth
feeling
puckered
a
dry
refreshing
and
deliciousa
classic
flanders
red
sour
and
assertive
without
the
velvety
complexity
of
oud
bruins
yummy
found
on
tap
at
the
lions
pride
in
brunswick
maine
this
has
a
dark
cherry
tinged
mahogany
color
with
a
decent
slightly
pink
cream
colored
head
and
nice
lacing
on
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
is
a
tart
cherry
baked
apple
and
sevenup
with
a
slight
maple
malt
hint
and
pepperwood
nice
except
for
the
somewhat
sodalike
hint
the
flavor
comes
on
with
bright
tartness
sharp
sour
cherry
with
maple
and
oak
malt
suggestions
i
get
pineapple
over
some
sweet
fruit
nougat
but
the
theme
is
of
course
tart
berry
in
a
medium
light
bodied
brew
with
very
tasteful
but
lively
fine
carbonation
very
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
and
i
do
beautiful
i
had
a
twelve
ounce
glass
of
this
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
in
manhattans
upper
west
side
this
is
one
of
the
best
flanders
reds
ive
had
great
sour
flavor
with
great
malt
character
and
all
in
a
beer
under
six
percent
aroma
was
not
the
beers
best
character
but
i
cant
wait
to
go
back
to
the
bar
and
order
another
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
dark
citrus
tart
malt
hint
of
alcohol
and
strong
sour
notes
fits
the
style
of
a
flanders
red
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
tartness
and
sourness
one
of
the
most
unique
mouth
feels
ive
had
tastes
of
slight
sweet
malt
slight
tart
malt
slight
citrus
slight
alcohol
and
strong
sourness
overall
ive
never
had
a
flanders
red
ale
but
this
was
an
awesome
experience
excellent
flanders
red
and
i
always
order
it
when
i
see
it
on
tap
now
only
if
we
could
get
some
bottles
so
i
can
start
hoarding
d
very
intense
but
i
loved
it
sure
i
couldnt
drink
it
all
day
but
beers
like
this
are
showing
me
how
much
i
enjoy
this
style
pours
a
dark
garnet
color
with
a
a
light
thin
head
sitting
atop
the
taste
on
this
one
is
incredible
it
is
complex
and
strong
with
a
bold
and
refreshing
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
coolest
things
about
this
beer
it
has
a
high
acidity
level
with
strips
the
palate
and
the
leaves
a
tannic
chewiness
in
its
wake
a
simply
stunning
example
of
the
the
style
if
you
enjoy
sours
i
cant
imagine
anyone
not
liking
this
one
jacob
pours
in
the
glass
with
a
dark
deep
plum
red
with
dark
brown
interwoven
just
some
sparse
bubbles
on
top
barely
nothing
no

include
big
cherries
and
plum
and
a
nice
vanilla
sweetness
with
oak
big
as
well
some
chocolate
and
small
vinegar
nose
taste
is
great
with
a
nice
mix
of
cherry
flavor
backed
by
a
small
chocolate
bite
like
a
hershey
kiss
plums
and
vanilla
with
some
sweetness
and
tartness
not
overly
sour
not
funky
just
oaky
woody
allen
flavorful
feel
is
smooth
from
some
malt
and
a
chocolate
vibe
but
its
also
tart
and
bold
id
say
medium
bodied
with
light
carb
i
like
how
the
vinegar
is
low
if
it
was
more
i
would
not
like
this
is
this
the
same
beer
as
ommegang
rouge
if
it
is
this
has
a
bit
more
of
a
body
on
er
very
similiar
this
is
quite
drinkable
in
fact
i
ordered
a
second
from
a
very
eclectic
tap
list
and
a
rarely
order
the
same
beer
twice
at
a
bar
good
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishamber
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
very
wine
like
with
some
tart
grapes
and
cherries
as
well
as
some
woody
notes
the
flavor
is
very
dry
with
lots
of
medium
tart
cherries
and
grapes
there
is
also
some
tannic
oak
notes
this
is
a
very
wine
like
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
nose

much
visible
carbonationthin
layer
of

after
careful

nose

the

little
if
any
hop
presence
this
is
one
funky
tasting
sour
good
dose
of
tartness
medium
mouthfeel
with
nice
tart
finish
this
is
my
first
stab
with
this
little
known
brewery
and
while
this
offering
may
lack
the
complexity
of
rodenbach
etc
this
is
a
nice
interpretation
of
ht
style
with
high
drinkability
most
definitely
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
recommended
toronado
a
good
to
very
good
flanders
red
which
is
always
a
treat
i
tried
this
beer
against
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
though
it
wasnt
quite
up
to
that
world
class
beer
it
still
had
a
quite
good
showing
cuvee
des
jacobins
rouge
looks
about
the
same
as
any
flanders
red
perhaps
leaning
toward
red
rather
than
mahogany
small
white
head
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
of
raspberries
cherries
oak
and
sour
its
actually
not
too
far
from
the
rodenbach
beers
perhaps
three
quarters
of
the
step
between
normal
rodenbach
and
the
grand
cru
though
without
that
beers
lovely
feel
the
beer
was
a
bit
more
acidic
than
the
grand
cru
and
it
was
fruitier
and
sourer
to
the
gcs
woodier
more
refined
nature
still
quite
good
this
was
a
satisfying
flanders
red
and
a
very
good
beer
d
starts
to
run
a
little
too
sour
on
the
end
to
drink
tons
of
but
not
bad
got
through
the
glass
easily
enough
d
good
dreally
easy
drinking
for
a
sour
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
but
i
like
mine
a
little
more
mouthpuckeringly
sour
tasted
on
draft
at
quenchers
pours
very
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
of
brett
vinegar
red
apple
citrus
and
some
cereal
flavors
of
red
wine
vinegar
sour
raspberry
red
apple
and
quince
carbonation
is
very
lively
with
a
lighter
body
and
a
medium
finish
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
sour
beer
should
be
it
isnt
the
best
but
a
prototypical
example
at
toronado
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
w
minimal
lace
strong
funk
and
tartness
up
front
cherries
green
apple
hops
and
lime
flavors
are
intense
sour
cherry
apple
raisin
and
the
slightest
vanilla
and
tobacco
this
is
a
rich
young
and
explosive
sour
beer
easily
aged
for
another
decade
the
sourness
does
not
overwhelm
and
shockingly
to
me
i
found
this
to
be
an
easy
drinker
im
not
sure
id
get
it
again
but
happy
i
tried
it
on
tap
at
toronado
crimsonhued
with
a
thin
white
cap
nice
clarity
and

and
cherry
note
really
enjoyable
stuff
md
a
bit
of
a
zip
to
the
mouthfeel
good
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
had
stayed
away
from
this
based
on
a
friends
bad
review
but
i
must
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
fantastic
nose
green
apple
funk
and
a
bit
of
vinegar
taste
has
all
the
flanders
red
requirements
dark
fruit
heavy
with
cherries
funk
and
a
pleasant
lactic
sourness
crisp
and
dry
utterly
drinkable
glad
i
took
the
metro
tonight
very
approachable
to
a
novice
sour
drinker
but
with
enogh
complexity
and
purity
to
staisfy
a
more
demanding
palate
a
very
fine
and
true
example
of
the
style
d
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
flanders
red
ale
that
ive
had
lately
very
nice
acidity
and
fruit
flavors
i
look
forward
to
having
this
one
again
d
great
flanders
red
ale
somewhat
similar
to
la
folie
or
rodenbach
with
a
very
assertive
sour
profile
and
just
enough
wood
and
fruit
to
make
it
something
interesting
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
but
i
found
it
a
little
bit
harder
to
put
down
since
there
was
more
sourness
than
flavor
sour
grape
and
mild
vinegar
sharpness
in
the
nose
a
mild
level
of
funkiness
of
unknown
origin
sipping
this
theres
a
clear
fruity
component
of
lemon
sour
grapes
and
cherries
puckering
at
first
leading
into
a
drier
finish
its
moderately
sour
not
as
sharp
as
la
folie
more
to
the
level
of
rodenbach
it
was
very
crisp
and
quenching
well
made
and
drinkable
this
would
be
nice
in
warmer
months
d
weighing
in
below
6
with
a
solid
flavor
and
not
too
much
acetic
tartness
whats
there
not
to
like
beautiful
deep
ruby
red
with
red
highlights
this
beer
is
very
attractive
despite
the
lack
of
head
the
nose
has
a
beautiful
sour
character
with
a
great
acetic
bite
that
is
wellcomplemented
by
vanill
and
sour
cherries
fruity
and
awesome
the
palate
is
so
like
the
ommegang
rouge
a
big
acetic
bite
to
open
things
off
refreshingly
so
theres
a
pleasing
amount
of
vanilla
and
ripe
sour
cherries
fruity
and
tart
low
in
tannins
this
beer
finishes
dry
and
tart
with
a
pleasing
vinegar
character
light
in
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
this
beer
is
insanely
refreshing
wellattenuated
and
pleasant
flavor
with
lots
of
green
apple
sourness
cherry
sweets
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
acidity
carbonation
is
high
but
not
overly
done
easy
to
drink
a
glass
but
not
much
desire
for
another
a
welldone
but
not
world
class
flanders
red
first
glass
very
drinkable
second
one
gets
you
with
the
acidic
nature
the
bartender
said
at
5
5
he
could
drink
it
all
night
long
i
could
not
with
the
acidity
having
said
that
i
loved
this
palate
is
smooth
with
mild
acidity
and
lively
carbonation
body
is
mediumlight
this
adds
to
the
drinkability
which
is
high
for
a
more
sour
beer
like
this
big
fan
of
these
flanders
reds
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
that
style
this
beer
hurt
my
face
when
i
drank
it
my
whole
face
puckered
when
i
drank
the
corners
of
my
cheeks
ached
my
face
kind
of
aches
just
from
the
memory
what
im
trying
to
say
is
holy
sour
batman
this
is
one
sour
mother
of
a
beer
so
tart
but
the
beer
finishes
cleanly
a
good
palate
cleansing
beer
body
was
a
little
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
fine
interesting
and
good
beer
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
hazy
plum
with
a
two
inch
creamy
offwhite
head
nose
was
dark
fruit
with
some
hints
of
wood
taste
follows
nose
extremely
flavorful
dark
fruit
and
vinous
with
a
pleasant
tartness
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
with
some
astringency
and
a
tartness
short
of
a
pucker
that
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
in
the
cheeks
incredibly
flavorful
particularly
considering
the
abv
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
is
very
drinkable
despite
its
tartness
the
guy
who
filled
my
growler
said
this
beer
was
more
or
less
the
same
as
ommegang
rouge
that
bockor
had
been
brewing
it
under
contract
its
definitely
very
similar
but
as
he
also
said
a
little
fresher
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
one
in
bottles
some
day
drinkability
is
great
a
very
easygoing
and
mellow
flemish
red
with
a
drinkable
character
and
an
approachable
aura
could
be
more
sour
but
still
very
well
put
together
cheers
served
in
a
delirium
tulip
glass
lucky
baldwins
pasadena
ca
d
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
all
around
and
has
a
real
nice
mix
of
tastes
no
problem
drinking
this
one
down
nice
to
have
a
good
beer
from
a
brewery
ive
never
heard
of
before
especially
in
this
classic
style
ontap
at
toronadosd
had
just
finished
a
dogfish
90minute
ipa
and
was
in
the
mood
for
something
new
and
different
poured
into
a
tulip
a
little
too
cold
fresh
from
the
tap
as
is
often
the
case
nice
amber
color
good
aroma
letting
it
linger
in
the
mouth
reveals
some
nice
underlying
malty
brown
alelike
flavors
underneath
the
sourness
seek
it
out
and
drink
it
down
a
really
dark
red
beer
with
some
visible
carbonation
it
smells
a
little
fruity
mostly
cherries
the
beer
also
tastes
very
cherry
with
a
serious
sour
after
taste
the
beer
was
very
light
and
carbonated
almost
tasting
fizzy
enjoyable
and
really
pushes
the
idea
of
what
to
expect
when
you
sit
down
to
drink
a
beer
d
not
too
sour
and
very
well
balanced
overall
a
really
good
example
of
the
flanders
style
ale
without
being
too
vinegary
d
i
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
but
could
not
consider
ordering
another
12
oz
glass
the
sourness
and
dryness
of
the
beer
becomes
overpowering
with
time
perhaps
as
the
beer
warms
and
i
prefer
to
have
the
accompaniment
of
sweet
with
this
style
bring
on
the
funk
bring
on
the
sour
a
great
pour
of
dark
cherry
red
smells
of
dried
cherries
a
little
lemon
and
belgian
funk
the
taste
is
even
better
gives
that
great
sour
cherry
pucker
at
first
then
you
get
the
great
funk
you
get
from
good
belgian
beers
nice
dry
smooth
mouthfeel
not
a
bitter
sour
but
a
good
sour
this
is
a
very
sour
and
refreshing
flanders
red
dare
i
say
i
like
it
more
than
la
folie
gasp
very
well
done
example
of
the
style
tawny
red
in
color
with
a
tightly
compacted
meringuelike
head
which
dissipates
quickly
sharp
lactic
notes
upfront
with
a
measured
amount
of
acetic
acid
and
a
refreshingly
dry
finish
dried
dark
cherries
lactic
acid
balsamic
vinegar
and
wet
leather
predominate
on
the
nose
with
a
slight
chocolateytoasted
malt
undertone
mediumthin
mouthfeel
i
know
its
a
bold
statement
but
this
rivals
both
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
panil
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
notes
i
was
hesitant
to
order
this
at
9
a
pour
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
nice
and
unique
red
somewhere
between
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
with
some
gueuze
to
lighten
it
up
draught
at
dirty
truth
pours
opaque
dark
red
without
much
of
a
head
smells
surprisingly
sweet
with
lots
of
typical
sour
cherry
pretty
acetic
a
bit
of
barnyard
funkiness
though
thats
really
in
the
back
seat
here
tastes
of
sour
cherry
with
artificial
sweetening
pretty
evident
unfortunately
quite
fruity
not
what
one
would
expect
of
a
sourlambic
mix
d
supereasy
to
drink
a
very
good
sour
d
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
very
smooth
was
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
very
good
taste
is
quite
the
kick
strong
sourtart
presence
but
after
the
first
few
sips
you
get
used
to
it
good
fruity
presence
with
good
carbonation
not
thick
or
sugary
or
cloyingly
sweet
either
a
good
balance
overall
and
a
good
sourish
selection
for
a
new
maine
beer
bar
to
have
reccomended
especially
if
you
like
sour
funky
beers
great
example
of
the
style
acidic
aroma
of
tart
cherry
preserves
and
red
wine
with
a
touch
of
caramel
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
milder
with
a
rounder
acidity
than
the
aroma
would
imply
with
the
same
dark
sugar
and
fruit
notes
as
in
the
nose
like
that
acidity
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
less
pronounced
than
in
some
examples
of
the
style
and
it
balances
nicely
complex
balanced
and
subtle
this
is
perhaps
the
first
hf
beer
that
i
have
had
that
fully
lives
up
to
their
substantial
reputation
and
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
quite
a
while
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
flemish
reds
i
have
ever
had
after
wandering
in
the
wilderness
for
many
years
hating
sours
it
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
categories
and
flemish
redsbrowns
my
favorite
style
of
the
sour
family
that
hint
of
robitussin
on
the
finish
makes
me
shudder
but
the
rest
is
excellent
well
done
o
great
representation
of
the
style
would
recommend
and
would
most
certainly
drink
again
overall
a
surprisingly
mellow
sourness
to
this
flander
red
this
is
one
of
the
best
flanders
red
that
i
have
had
not
much
port
wine
influence
but
just
enough
so
that
you
know
that
its
there
another
great
brew
by
hill
farmstead
an
excellant
mouthfeel
with
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
a
flanders
red
nice
leathery
fruity
notes
along
with
just
a
bit
of
sour
and
funk
a
tasty
brew
m
medium
body
dry
moderate
carbonation
pour
is
dark
copper
brown
with
a
thin
tight
tan
head
nose
has
a
hint
of
dark
malt
base
with
some
sawdust
and
sour
cherry
taste
is
similar
a
little
watery
and
less
bright
than
the
nose
there
is
a
stronger
dark
malt
component
than
a
normal
flanders
red
fairly
sour
with
notes
of
tart
sour
cherry
but
a
bit
thin
in
flavor
through
the
finish
very
strong
carbonation
on
a
lighter
body
no
glaring
flaws
not
acetic
at
all
but
not
bright
and
a
bit
watery
oan
amazing
sour
what
a
good
beer
sean
hill
can
do
no
wrong
o
this
was
a
very
nice
unique
take
on
a
flanders
there
arent
many
breweries
that
make
use
of
port
barrels
and
i
like
how
the
port
brought
out
a
little
bit
more
of
the
vinous
dark
fruit
qualities
of
the
beer
while
adding
a
nice
barrel
presence
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
experiment
with
cellaring
for
another
year
or
two
decent
flanders
red
there
was
something
odd
about
this
one
that
is
different
from
the
others
ive
had
it
might
be
the
strong
dryness
on
the
backend
that
threw
me
off
still
this
is
a
wellput
together
beer
that
may
interest
you
if
you
enjoy
the
flanders
red
style
o
a
very
solid
flanders
red
quite
possibly
the
best
american
attempt
at
the
style
ive
had
much
more
depth
and
complexity
than
something
like
oude
tart
but
lacking
in
that
refreshing
cherry
acidity
that
beers
like
cuvee
des
jacobins
rouge
possess
a
nice
beer
glad
to
have
another
to
sample
in
time
the
first
iteration
of
a
flanders
red
ale
ive
had
from
hill
farmstead
and
its
predictably
awesome
great
flavor
excellent
feel
and
a
nose
and
appearance
that
ties
everything
together
very
good
p
s
after
dumping
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
in
the
flavor
improved
noticeably
overall
quite
nice
to
start
nice
nose
nice
initial
flavor
but
the
finish
gets
a
little
icky
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
fairly
straight
forward
not
a
fan
of
the
finish
o
honestly
i
have
not
had
many
flanders
reds
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
to
but
it
was
surprisingly
drinkable
and
tart
no
harshness
at
all
with
a
subtle
oak
dryness
the
beer
is
mahogany
to
crimson
colored
with
a
thin
collar
aromas
of
oak
cherries
vinegar
plums
wine
very
nice
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
sour
cherries
and
an
overall
acetic
character
vinous
and
lightly
sweet
grapes
and
cherries
some
musty
oak
an
outstanding
representation
of
the
style
delicious
what
can
i
say
the
taste
of
tart
cherries
sat
on
my
palette
for
a
half
hour
after
i
finished
the
beer
i
couldnt
stop
thinking
about
it
the
only
thing
i
could
possibly
follow
it
up
with
was
an
elaborative
1
there
was
nothing
else
in
my
cellar
that
would
do
it
justice
after
this
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
im
very
impressed
by
how
well
the
nose
and
flavor
is
balanced
i
assume
there
was
some
blending
involved
if
so
it
was
done
masterfully
the
appearance
is
gorgeous
due
to
the
dark
color
and
head
that
wont
recede
how
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
and
integrated
with
the
flavors
is
especially
impressive
in
my
opinion
i
would
not
age
this
brew
its
already
spent
two
years
in
barrels
and
is
ready
to
enjoy
now
o
full
disclosure
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
flanders
red
ales
in
my
time
this
one
is
by
far
the
most
balanced
and
easiest
to
drink
of
the
style
despite
being
the
strongest
the
oak
really
shines
prolegomena
is
another
fantastic
beer
from
hill
farmstead
othe
flavors
in
this
beer
were
unique
and
complex
really
like
this
style
o
i
am
trying
to
be
critical
of
this
but
it
is
difficult
to
do
so
prolegomena
is
a
wellmade
beer
that
is
ready
to
drink
right
this
second
there
is
a
perfect
balance
between
the
acid
and
funk
that
makes
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
ive
found
with
some
beers
from
this
style
a
4
ounce
pour
is
more
than
enough
i
could
easily
drink
a
bomber
of
this
by
myself
and
would
only
be
detoured
from
continuing
by
the
alcohol
content
another
home
run
from
shaun
and
crew
overall
decent
flanders
a
little
too
dry
for
me
o
all
around
perfect
4
not
the
best
flanders
red
ive
ever
had
but
i
love
the
spices
that
come
out
even
if
they
may
not
really
be
there
not
overly
tart
which
is
nice
as
well
in
this
type
of
brew
and
a
lot
of
barrel
characteristics
that
hf
seems
to
be
really
good
at
with
their
wild
ales
now
that
its
getting
warmer
im
boosting
the
taste
up
a
bit
so
yeah
let
it
warm
up
quite
a
bit
o
a
little
lacking
in
the
appearance
but
the
rest
really
shines
a
beauty
otherwise
great
oak
character
overall
a
very
impressive
flanders
red
from
shaun
and
company
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
was
executed
very
very
well
age
not
needed
on
this
one
its
amazing
now
very
enjoyable
brew
i
expected
nothing
less
from
hill
farmstead
with
this
one
i
love
sours
but
this
beer
opened
my
eyes
up
to
the
fact
that
a
wellrounded
sour
and
not
a
puckeryourlipswithalum
sour
is
the
bar
to
measure
this
style
against
very
glad
i
got
to
share
the
first
released
bottle
of
this
beer
with
some
good
friends
another
great
sour
style
beer
to
me
this
is
just
a
classic
that
all
must
try
this
is
what
a
flemish
sour
should
be
its
darn
near
perfection
in
a
glass
it
pours
a
brilliant
rubyred
color
with
minimal
head
and
little
lacing
the
tart
smell
reminiscent
of
a
natural
crisp
hard
apple
cider
is
a
delight
to
the
olfactory
buds
the
flavor
is
also
crisp
modestly
sour
and
has
a
very
clean
finish
if
you
enjoy
sour
beers
you
should
give
strubbes
a
try
i
believe
it
will
be
your
goldstandard
on
which
to
compare
other
beers
of
this
style
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
some
hints
of
copper
and
mahogany
ltos
of
head
which
goes
down
quick
the
smell
is
of
red
wine
cranberries
lots
of
fruit
taste
is
purple
grape
not
too
sour
less
acidity
than
a
sour
and
the
sweetness
is
mellow
carboation
a
yeast
taste
like
champagne
serve
with
blackberry
pie
creamcheese
dishes
stuffed
calzonespizza
not
bad
at
all
this
flemish
had
very
subtle
vinegar
qualities
some
hints
of
cherryand
other
fruit
not
bad
at
all
but
not
great
pours
out
a
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
this
has
one
of
the
strongest
noses
of
any
flemish
sour
ive
ever
had
loads
of
berries
vanilla
caramel
malts
a
whiff
of
vinegar
flavor
is
very
sour
with
an
excellent
dryness
in
the
finish
vinegar
isnt
overwhelming
as
in
some
other
flemish
sours
very
fruity
with
a
mild
toastiness
from
the
malts
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
this
is
easily
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
style
that
ive
had
good
flemish
red
vinegary
finish
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
the
pour
looked
promising
a
reddish
brew
with
a
brown
cast
light
brown
head
that
held
but
the
aroma
had
a
muted
sour
with
a
sweet
component
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
some
sour
but
not
much
some
cherry
but
not
much
this
gave
way
to
a
malty
sweet
on
the
finish
yeast
present
but
subtle
ovearll
a
solid
flemish
red
ale
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
starter
for
people
just
getting
into
the
style
if
you
have
never
had
a
flemish
red
ale
or
a
sour
try
this
cheers
overall
very
tasty
an
aboveaverage
flemmish
red
ale
but
not
the
best
either
overall
an
easy
drinker
but
lacks
funk
and
tartness
when
compared
to
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
poured
a
nice
dark
deep
reddish
brown
with
red
tinting
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
quite
nice
very
appealing
and
pleasant
to
look
at
scents
of
balsamic
vinegar
sour
cherries
overripe
fruit
sour
funk
and
faint
caramel
malt
a
good
sour
aroma
quite
appealing
flavor
begins
with
sour
and
funky
notes
alongside
sweet
moscatolike
white
grape
moving
into
some
indeterminate
fruity
flavors
sour
apple
caramel
and
earthy
mustiness
the
finish
is
tart
with
some
sweetness
an
excellent
flavor
profile
that
blends
sour
and
sweet
into
a
lovely
whole
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
sticky
semidrying
feel
quite
nice
overall
this
was
a
great
flanders
red
that
has
an
excellent
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
highly
recommended
o
3
75
great
sour
beer
would
have
it
again
belgium
is
pretty
good
at
this
stuff
d
a
wonderfully
reserved
sour
waves
of
varying
fruits
again
reserved
not
over
the
top
im
starting
to
really
appreciate
blended
beers
like
this
one
50
young
beer
blended
with
50
beer
aged
in
bordeaux
wine
barrels
the
aging
softens
this
brew
and
adds
a
nuanced
extra
layer
of
complexity
this
is
one
youll
want
to
take
your
time
to
enjoy
even
though
the
abv
is
a
very
agreeable
6
5
o
it
isnt
the
greatest
flanders
red
ale
ive
had
but
far
from
the
worst
it
is
quite
sweet
and
slightly
tart
but
not
really
that
sour
for
me
i
love
sours
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
12
a
bottle
at
a
bar
but
if
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
at
a
beer
store
for
cheaper
i
might
consider
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
funky
but
not
out
of
control
nice
balance
makes
for
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
2
the
sourness
of
the
beer
didnt
agree
with
me
but
the
citrus
flavors
were
good
live
life
drink
beer
overall
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
seems
a
bit
thin
but
flavor
is
there
i
like
the
sourness
of
it
and
i
like
the
general
style
of
these
brews
often
wonder
why
no
american
brewer
attempts
a
sour
do
americans
just
not
get
into
these
types
of
beers
i
love
em
overall
this
is
a
good
flanders
with
a
sweeter
approach
i
like
my
flanders
to
be
a
little
more
tart
but
this
is
solid
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
light
brownoff
white
head
nose
is
vinegar
cherry
grape
caramel
apple
cider
and
a
sharp
citrus
hidden
way
in
the
back
the
taste
is
much
less
vinegary
thankfully
cherry
sour
apples
grapes
berries
slight
vinegar
in
the
background
and
a
little
lemon
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
lower
than
i
thought
itd
be
the
sour
level
on
this
is
way
lower
than
expected
just
a
slight
tartness
not
the
best
flemish
redsour
etc
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
it
says
best
before
2017
so
maybe
the
vinegar
would
mellow
out
and
itd
move
a
lot
up
the
ladder
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
the
weight
of
the
body
leaving
the
mouthfeel
to
be
smooth
but
turgid
finish
is
dry
as
expected
but
little
sourness
can
be
felt
on
the
palate
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
balsamic
and
red
wine
vinegar
on
the
nose
some
malt
sweetness
a
touch
of
oak
and
a
bit
of
grass
theres
a
weird
coffee
sort
of
aroma
in
there
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
too
the
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
acetic
sourness
to
it
some
red
wine
vinegar
oak
leather
and
grass
somewhat
dry
on
the
finish
a
bit
of
coca
cola
in
there
as
well
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
some
fruity
grape
juice
and
grape
jelly
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
along
with
a
slight
vinegar
flavor
as
well
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
this
is
a
nice
flanders
red
ale
its
pretty
direct
and
not
really
complex
or
unusual
which
is
aokay
with
me
its
nice
to
be
able
to
get
a
beer
of
this
style
that
works
and
fits
to
how
it
should
be
as
usual
the
first
hit
really
zaps
your
mouth
but
its
happy
trails
from
there
on
out
overall
the
oak
really
pops
out
in
this
beer
it
is
not
the
most
complex
example
of
the
style
ive
had
but
the
tannin
should
make
it
fun
to
age
a
few
bottles
very
fun
beer
to
drink
and
a
great
sub
for
red
wine
overall
pretty
interesting
brew
overall
not
a
bad
taste
and
pretty
intriguing
to
think
about
a
very
nice
sour
good
intro
sour
but
also
a
good
sour
for
veterans
d
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
really
not
that
interesting
i
forgot
the
price
but
if
this
was
cheap
it
would
be
worth
it
as
a
nice
refreshing
beer
otherwise
its
overshadowed
by
others
in
its
class
theres
some
good
stuff
going
on
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
flanders
red
but
it
just
doesnt
come
together
great
for
me
not
bad
for
the
style
but
passable
pours
brown
purely
brown
without
even
a
red
glow
definitely
sweet
for
the
style
the
sweetest
ive
had
still
enough
sour
to
get
the
idea
big
on
brown
sugar
and
musty
wood
also
some
cherry
raspberry
and
fig
along
with
a
woody
peppery
spice
much
more
oude
bruin
in
my
opinion
good
enough
not
great
between
this
and
the
duchesse
the
2
regularly
available
flanders
reds
in
oklahoma
ill
go
duchesse
everytime
wheres
the
tartness
wheres
the
refreshing
quality
a
very
average
flanders
red
sweet
in
the
wrong
way
a
tough
style
to
master
for
sure
and
i
love
to
try
them
all
this
one
is
pretty
true
to
style
so
i
give
it
that
not
a
mockery
by
any
means
its
just
that
im
used
to
quality
and
this
doesnt
have
much
of
that
if
youre
like
me
and
love
these
ales
then
i
must
say
its
worth
one
spin
one
and
thats
all
youll
know
what
i
mean
3
5
not
all
flanders
reds
are
the
same
strubbes
is
a
good
one
and
one
that
is
a
little
sweeter
than
the
crowd
possibly
a
good
choice
to
those
who
want
to
get
introduced
to
the
style
the
liquid
comes
out
looking
dark
reddish
in
hue
with
some
brown
strokes
set
within
a
nice
fuzzy
coca
cola
like
head
skims
up
with
some
tightness
and
a
off
tan
color
to
it
no
stick
on
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
much
deep
vinegar
with
some
faint
cherry
scent
and
some
grain
trace
amounts
of
caramel
notes
but
this
one
is
all
about
the
vinegar
taste
is
sweet
over
sour
and
its
very
apparent
vinegar
cherry
cola
sweet
malt
you
get
the
picture
very
reminiscent
of
duchesses
feel
is
less
than
medium
a
nice
crisp
carb
and
not
acidic
not
a
pucker
inducing
beer
but
pleasant
i
just
cant
stand
the
vinegar
i
could
only
drink
6oz
of
this
before
passing
on
it
o
tough
category
to
be
in
because
there
are
a
lot
of
delicious
flanders
red
ales
i
feel
like
the
average
flanders
red
is
pretty
damn
good
so
this
one
is
a
little
above
average
it
can
hold
up
against
the
big
boys
i
like
the
balance
thats
struck
between
the
acetic
and
sweet
qualities
odnot
bad
at
all
didnt
have
any
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
although
after
some
sips
it
tasted
a
bit
off
quite
a
good
time
however
because
it
mostly
tasted
damn
good
aftertaste
is
vinegar
then
crab
apples
good
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
nice
yeast
profile
and
went
down
very
smooth
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
overall
this
was
another
delicious
treat
to
start
off
the
new
year
belgiums
grow
on
me
more
and
more
and
only
one
thing
to
do
go
there
i
think
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
sour
and
oak
to
the
beers
but
after
being
aged
for
a
while
these
things
may
have
mellowed
out
and
let
the
tart
fruits
come
out
still
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
again
tartness
starts
out
slow
buikds
still
a
touch
sweeter
than
i
like
my
flanders
red
this
needs
some
age
i
think
but
would
be
a
great
entre
to
the
style
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
sour
taste
is
less
funky
than
i
expected
tart
with
a
sweet
malty
backbone
almost
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
with
a
hint
of
sour
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
the
sour
stays
on
my
palate
for
a
while
still
on
the
whole
its
well
balanced
overall
and
very
drinkable
would
have
liked
more
fruits
and
complex
funky
flavors
to
come
through
but
that
might
just
be
my
expectations
of
the
style
talking
dr
very
drinkable
which
isnt
often
observed
in
beers
of
this
style
a
good
a
relatively
above
average
abv
and
good
quality
make
this
a
beer
every
beer
advocate
should
try
not
a
bad
flemish
red
and
pleasantly
smooth
i
really
like
a
good
bite
of
acidity
to
the
style
thoughto
me
this
is
a
quenching
refreshing
style
of
beer
and
this
one
misses
that
somewhat
thats
not
to
say
its
not
an
interesting
example
however
taste
follows
this
caramel
malt
sweetness
mild
tartness
something
oddly
vegetal
then
it
finishes
tangy
and
dry
thankfully
not
sweet
as
some
pretenders
to
the
style
can
be
malt
sweetness
shows
through
at
room
temperature
there
are
some
mild
fruit
and
vinous
qualities
that
are
hallmarks
of
the
style
overall
ok
though
id
probably
grab
rodenbach
over
this
any
day
still
its
something
to
try
for
fans
of
flemish
sour
ales
recommended
taste
is
sweettart
cherries
iron
hint
of
dark
bread
finish
of
caramelized
topast
and
grain
light
hint
of
peppery
bitterness
it
is
excellent
with
good
complexity
and
depth
and
a
very
nice
full
character
with
good
balance
someone
told
me
this
tastes
like
what
rodenbach
used
to
taste
like
not
really
sure
what
that
means
but
lets
find
out
it
pours
out
a
hazy
dark
rose
color
with
a
creamy
one
finger
of
white
heading
husky
grain
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
in
the
smell
followed
by
some
chocolate
and
red
berry
very
vinous
as
far
as
the
taste
is
concerned
you
definitely
get
cherry
but
not
especially
sweet
a
hint
of
black
pepper
can
also
be
detected
here
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
layered
in
complexity
this
is
one
big
beefy
rendition
of
a
flanders
red
and
a
damn
tasty
one
at
that
super
rare
steak
and
this
beer
need
to
come
together
soon
nice
prickly
carbonation
up
front
a
balanced
sweet
malt
and
tart
berry
middle
finish
is
dry
and
lightly
puckering
id
say
overall
its
a
very
refreshing
balance
and
this
is
one
of
the
more
easy
drinking
flemish
reds
ive
had
it
does
well
after
some
warmth
allowing
the
bugs
to
bite
a
little
more
would
be
interesting
to
try
one
with
some
cellar
time
not
the
best
but
a
very
good
intro
o
a
very
nice
example
of
this
style
i
would
easily
put
this
into
the
ranks
of
rodenbach
very
drinkable
and
quite
delicious
o
not
a
bad
beer
kind
of
on
the
lower
end
of
the
style
for
me
nothing
really
here
to
come
back
to
as
a
stand
alone
beer
its
a
b
just
not
very
good
to
style
compared
with
rodenbach
or
la
folie
theres
no
contest
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
perhaps
a
good
cross
into
reds
it
does
blend
better
as
the
temperature
increases
perhaps
i
began
at
too
low
a
temp
worth
trying
not
my
favorite
overall
decent
refreshing
sour
beer
nothing
to
right
home
about
i
would
drink
it
over
any
other
common
main
stream
beer
but
only
as
a
last
result
notes
well
balanced
but
lacks
depth
especially
for
the
style
a
sour
beer
that
since
it
isnt
so
sour
would
be
good
with
food
overall
this
is
a
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
although
certainly
above
average
thanks

theres
also

yeasty
character
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel

lightmedium
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
creamy
towards
the
middle
that
culminates
in
a
semidry
finish
an
easy
drinking
flanders
red
that
would
make
a
great
gateway
beer
for
someone
just
getting
into
sours
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
flemish
ale
and
one
which
other
nonsour
drinkers
found
very
interesting
and
inviting
i
hope
to
get
more
to
see
if
the
brett
and
lacto
improve
or
get
funkier
with
a
little
more
time
very
drinkable
and
very
nice
this
is
a
beer
that
the
inexperienced
and
experienced
will
both
like
good
with
lots
of
food
profiles
taste
matches
the
smell
sweet
but
soon
gives
way
to
a
very
tangy
flavor
with
an
oaky
bourbony
if
thats
a
word
presence
d
an
interesting
complex
tasty
beer
well
worth
trying
something
id
buy
again
i
could
not
taste
the
yeast
in
this
beer
but
this
seems
to
fit
the
flemish
red
ale
category
definition
perfectly
and
while
it
was
too
sour
from
my
perspective
and
definitely
not
a
session
beer
i
still
found
it
somewhat
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying

poured

nice
orange
toned

color
from
the
tap
into
a
very
nice
looking
goblet
style
glass
the
head
was
nonexistant
but
i
cant
say
if
it
was
the
beer
or
whatever
the
bar
happened
to
wash
the
glass
with
after
a
few
sipps
the
head
on
the
side
of
the
glass
remained
the
flavor
was
sweet
and
sour
with
a
tart
aftertaste
very
light
in
the
body
making
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
my
first
beer
of
this
event
so
i
was
hirsty
but
still
a
good
start
regaurless
served
a
clear
dark

minimal

of

with
a

taste
mimics
the
smell
crisp
dry
aftertaste
infinately
drinkable
light
body
and
not
too
much
of
anything
but
more
than
enough
to
be
interesting
excellent
2008
vintage
fantastic
these
just
get
so
much
better
with
age
overall
cascade
are
artists
with
barrels
the
shear
complexity
of
a
beer
like
this
really
holds
my
attention
all
the
way
through
as
i
try
to
discern
everything
that
i
am
experiencing
all
of
the
krieks
qualities
coalesce
into
a
truly
fine
beer
the
bottle
comes
with
a
little
sticker
shock
but
ill
drink
this
on
draught
any
day
of
the
week
i
had
the
2013
edition
of
kriek
overall
a
good
beer
price
however
isnt
justifiable
yet
still
a
nice
beer
to
have
a
taster
of
2011
vintage
long
awaited
for
me
the
cascade
kriek
what
a
true
delight
i
love
the
use
of
multiple
cherry
types
i
think
it
makes
a
more
layered
and
interesting
beer
i
also
like
its
alcoholic
strength
its
uncommonly
strong
which
i
think
forces
me
to
slow
it
down
just
a
bit
and
appreciate
every
sip
its
dark
red
foggy
ruby
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
with
excellent
staying
power
it
smells
only
a
touch
medicinal
before
the
sweeter
nature
of
the
cherries
crashes
into
the
lactic
acidity
and
sourness
its
intense
as
they
get
both
in
aroma
and
flavor
and
the
cherries
never
lose
their
authenticity
in
the
taste
that
medicinal
thing
is
now
obviously
a
product
of
the
higher
abv
and
i
like
what
it
does
here
subtle
but
not
absent
rich
beer
flush
body
and
warming
in
the
belly
the
fruit
stays
after
the
sourness
subsides
on
the
finish
which
is
both
unique
and
welcomed
my
tongue
is
in
heaven
i
like
the
density
of
the
fruit
the
body
of
the
beer
that
is
never
for
a
second
syrupy
or
thick
like
these
can
get
on
the
cheap
end
definitely
brilliantly
crafted
worth
the
wait
and
the
hype
i
love
it
takes
the
style
somewhere
new
and
thats
always
a
pleasure
to
ride
along
with
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
american
made
sour
kriek
very
lively
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
world
class
beer
and
worth
every
penny
overall
a
great
sour
super
tart
but
really
drinkable
would
drink
this
every
day
of
the
week
if
i
could
oavoided
the
cherry
flavor
being
too
sweet
which
was
a
huge
plus
for
me
mouthfeel
is
extremely
dry
overall
this
is
quite
good
overall
another
outstanding
cascade
brewing
beer
though
not
as
good
as
the
apricot
or
blueberry
in
my
opinion
high
price
though
at
over
30
a
very
decent
kriek
this
year
wellbalanced
with
good
sourness
medium
body
and
interesting
fruit
and
rustic
notes

tall
fizzy
pink
head
that
quickly
recedes
the
head
ends
up
lingering
as
a
very
small
creamy
bubble

on
top
that
is
really
interesting
lots
of
sour
cherries
on
the
aroma
with
some
vinegar
there
and
dry

flavor
is
super
sour
cherries
with
a
light
vinegar
note
that
is
balanced
out
by
the
super
dry
oak
flavors
really
nice
kriek
that
highlights
the
cherries
without
being
medicinal
miles
better
than
the
blueberry
mess
i
had
last
night
good
beer
o
pretty
much
the
only
cascade
sour
i
was
tempted
to
by
a
bottle
of
when
i
visited
their
brewpub
came
together
really
nicely
i
find
this
to
be
slightly
underrated
vintage
unknown
but
most
likely
2010
pours
a
reddishbrown
hue
with
a
loose
halfinch
head
and
a
hazy
clarity
nose
reveals
cherries
and
a
suggestion
of
cough
syrup
taste
consistent
with
nose
this
beer
is
tart
but
not
overly
so
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
some
astringency
and
a
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
solid
kriek
with
some
brunelike
qualities
fantastic
brew
another
winner
from
cascade
great
kreik
really
enjoyable
o
incredible
highly
recommended
tartsweet
cherries
phenomenal
kriek
use
this
to
convert
those
who
dont
like
sours
i
was
baffled
on
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
in
a
sense
really
i
enjoyed
this
in
the
same
manner
that
im
madly
in
love
with
rioja
wines
where
the
lightskinned
tempranillo
grapes
absorb
a
good
deal
of
the
barrel
character
and
transform
the
wine
into
something
that
feels
larger
than
it
really
is
this
is
the
same
situation
here
only
its
carbonated
its
far
lower
in
alcohol
and
its
beer
truly
an
excellent
achievement
in
the
realm
of
cherry
infused
beers
i
cannot
recommend
it
enough
another
great
brew
from

surprise

acidic

not
for
the
faint
of
heart
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
certainly
the
best
flanders
red
ive
ever
had
its
too
bad
these
are
so
darn
expensive
but
i
do
like
the
fact
that
they
are
relatively
easy
to
get
since
cascade
is
able
to
sell
beer
directtoconsumer
somehow
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
beer
drinks
very
well
with
complexity
of
fruit
funk
and
tartness
this
stands
well
against
to
cantillon
kriek
super
sour
lacto
bomb
puckers
my
face
some
cherry
and
nice
barrel
funk
taste
brings
on
the
sourness
and
cherries
big
time
sour
cherries
much
more
than
fresh
more
teeth
enamelremoving
sour
than
anything
else
though
quite
impressive
general
lemon
vinegar
bread
funk
and
some
oak
has
a
bigger
feel
that
shows
the
abv
a
little
bit
kinda
reminds
me
of
petrus
aged
pale
in
its
abvness
but
pulled
off
nicely
high
carbonation
and
bracing
sourness
makes
this
a
sipper
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
there
is
a
pleasant
amount
of
sourness
that
is
not
overpowering
but
it
is
still
noticeable
the
cherries
are
tart
but
strong
enough
to
keep
this
one
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
amazing
sour
i
shared
this
with
my
cousins
and
unfortunately
they
didnt
like
it
or
couldnt
drink
it
all
but
it
was
a
win
more
for
me
mmm
seems
like
an
outlier
hope
this
batch
was
only
one
barrel
note

abv
overall
a
good
flemish
red
especially
from
an
american
brewery
but
nothing
amazing
not
worth
the
price
when
you
have
imported
reds
like
rodenbach
for
half
the
price
and
more
readily
available
but
this
one
is
good
nonetheless
o
great
beer
bold
flavors
but
each
of
them
layer
on
top
of
each
other
so
evenly
they
are
incredibly
balanced
very
fresh
and
natural
tasting
as
well
o
very
nice
beer
you
know
its
a
cascade
sour
and
you
know
it
was
brewed
with
cherries
can
you
really
ask
for
anything
more
id
love
to
get
me
hands
on
a
few
more
bottles
and
drink
this
a
few
times
a
year
a
decent
fruit
sour
but
among
the
weaker
ones
ive
had
from
cascade
the
fruit
presence
is
light
and
the
sour
is
muddy
and
has
some
slightly
off
elements
worth
drinking
again
but
probably
not
at
20
per
bottle
o
really
a
phenomenally
blended
beer
that
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
didnt
give
it
as
high
a
rating
because
i
wanted
it
to
be
more
sour
but
the
cherries
stepped
up
in
a
big
way
you
wont
go
wrong
here
4
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
with
a
great
combination
of
sour
bite
and
fruit
flavors
i
liked
it
more
and
more
with
each
sip
but
with
a
significantly
higher
price
than
rodenbach
grand
cru
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
regular
thing
d
great
flanders
red
good
sourness
and
overall
balance
o
a
very
good
kriekflanders
red
qualities
remind
me
of
rodenbach
with
the
oakyness
and
the
sourness
is
excellent
its
quite
good
any
way
you
slice
it
and
it
drinks
pretty
easy
a
good
sour
the
cherries
overpower
some
of
the
subtleties
but
it
does
deliver
as
promised
overall
a
solid
flanders
red
right
up
there
with
any
of
the
others
that
ive
tried
only
problem
at
almost
twice
the
price
of
something
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
it
isnt
twice
as
good
overall
nice
sour
here
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
big
classic
flemish
reds
but
its
definitely
a
nice
cherrypacked
twist
o
honestly
i
was
kinda
disappointed
i
dont
know
if
i
just
expected
too
much
but
this
is
a
fairly
mild
juicy
kriek
maybe
with
some
years
on
it
could
develop
more
but
overall
impression
this
is
good
but
not
great
its
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
this
is
a
really
good
kriek
i
liked
it
because
it
wasnt
sweet
like
so
many
of
the
belgian
krieks
are
the
cherry
flavor
and
sourness
are
perfect
for
me
it
isnt
a
funky
sour
id
like
to
see
a
funkier
version
of
this
with
a
heavier
lacto
taste
and
some
barnyard
not
to
replace
this
beer
but
to
compliment
it
o
with
the
label
full
of
cherries
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
very
well
done
a
challenge
to
supplication
a
barrel
aged
sour
cherry
beer
isnt
cheap
to
produce
and
it
shows
it
on
the
price
is
it
worth
it
id
say
it
is
if
sours
are
your
type
of
thing
then
you
should
enjoy
this
cascade
would
i
buy
another
bottle
i
already
did
i
want
to
see
what
age
will
do
to
this
beer
m
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
cascade
as
far
as
american
sours
go
theyre
the
only
ones
ive
had
that
can
give
russian
river
a
run
for
their
money
a
very
nice
beer
from
cascade
one
of
the
best
cherry
sours
ive
had
overall
quite
good
the
oak
is
at
just
the
right
level
clearly
present
but
not
too
strong
overall
definitely
one
for
the
sourheads
out
there
not
a
complex
flavor
but
its
clean
and
has
a
nice
cherry
flavor
o
a
nice
sour
beer
cascade
does
a
nice
job
with
their
sour
offerings
just
always
tough
to
pick
up
due
to
the
pricetag
glad
i
was
able
to
get
this
one
on
tap
o
this
is
one
delicious
kriek
o
quite
a
well
developed
sour
might
be
the
best
one
i
had
from
cascade
o
a
great
flanders
red
if
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
again
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
medium
sourness
loads
of
red
wine
cherries
cherries
cherries
awesome
overall
the
surprise
is
the
salt
component
on
this
which
is
large
but
tolerable
its
a
nice
contrast
and
unlike
any
other
kriek
or
fruit
sour
ales
ive
had
before
unique
beer
fun
would
have
again
murky

with
a

mmmm
excellent
o
a
very
nice
kriek
nice
cherry
flavors
and
sourness
enjoyed
it
very
much
feel
is
bursting
with
tartness
all
around
the
mouth
swish
this
around
your
mouth
and
feel
the
full
effect
totally
worth
it
missing
some
of
the
sweetness
and
vinegar
from
standard
belgian
flanders
but
that
does
not
bother
me
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
the
style
for
me
body
is
medium
and
has
some
life
with
bubbles
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
it
was
nice
i
dont
see
this
one
as
a
long
term
aging
beer
perhaps
a
year
or
so
but
dont
stretch
it
at
the
level
of
sourness
this
has
now
whats
the
point
overall
this
is
a
yummy
beer
nice
cherry
character
and
the
tartness
adds
to
a
wonderful
drinkability
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
in
subsequent
years
i
enjoyed
it
cold
but
it
did
get
a
bit
better
as
it
warmed
d
a
bit
singular
in
flavor
but
hits
it
on
the
head
would
revisit
o
definitely
a
good
kriek
the
pie
cherries
are
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
theres
plenty
of
acidity
to
balance
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
garnetruby
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
cap
i
can
smell
cherries
as
soon
as
i
wrangle
the
cork
off
the
top
pf
the
bottle
upon
closer
inspection
my
nostrils
are
filled
with
fruity
tart
sweet
and
sour
cherries
raspberries
and
lemons
theres
a
hint
of
funk
and
a
bit
of
residual
brown
sugar
but
this
one
is
all
about
the
tart
tart
cherries
and
lemons
rule
the
palette
with
every
sip
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
with
bits
of
sugar
and
funk
barely
getting
through
to
provide
faint
hints
of
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
found
it
incredibly
tart
i
wonder
how
this
beer
is
fresh
this
is
a
truly
amazing
beer
everything
it
should
be
if
someone
let
you
taste
this
blind
you
would
think
it
was
straight
from
belgium
an
absolute
treat
that
i
cannot
believe
comes
locally
from
oregon
these
guys
know
how
to
make
a
sour
it
says
kriek
on
the
bottle
but
its
only
because
its
brewed
with
cherries
otherwise
this
is
all
flanders
red
funky
sour
earthy
sweet
tart
robust
the
thing
about
sours
is
that
they
are
so
complex
but
the
description
i
come
up
with
is
simple
ill
attribute
this
to
the
centuries
of
brewing
tradition
and
the
simple
enjoyment
that
comes
with
a
great
sour
theres
no
thinking
just
drinking
muddy
blood
red
poured
with
the
yeast
with
several
fingers
of
browned
white
head
strong
lacing
moderate

cherry
pits

has
more
sour
cherries
off
the
bat
more
lactic
sourness
slight
oak
and
more
straight
cherry
flavour
into
the
finish
gentle
malt
sweetness
but
sour
cherry
and
lactic
notes
shine
slight
cherry
pie
flavours
as
this
warms
medium
full
feel
for
a
sour
and
a
bit
of
bite
to
the
carbonation
an
excellent
sour
great
fruit
flavours
and
just
plain
tasty
medium
bodied
with
a
very
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
and
a
strong
earthy
lactic
funk
presence
that
overpowers
the
sweet
fruit
flavor
very
funky
with
lots
of
lactic
sourness
strong
oak
barrel
character
with
a
ton
of
funky
bugs
lactic
cheesiness
and
acetic
acid
slightly
harsh
and
acidic
with
a
strong
acetic
vingear
and
solvent
character
lingering
in
the
finish
some
tart
cherry
sweetness
but
the
fruit
has
faded
considerably
at
thus
point
and
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
sour
funk
i
usually
love
cascade
sours
but
this
was
one
dimensional
and
too
heavy
on
the
acetic
solvent
flavor
pretty
harsh
and
tough
to
drink
overall
very
nice
beer
super
sour
holy
cow
d
wonderfully
drinkable
with
massive
complex
flavor
active
body
yet
still
viscous
enough
to
carry
all
the
flavors
an
excellent
americanstyle
kriek
thats
sure
to
convert
your
nonbeer
friends
overall
this
is
way
above
most
krieks
that
i
have
drank
i
think
that
this
beer
does
not
get
the
accolades
that
it
deserves
its
really
a
enjoyable
sour
this
was
my
second
favorite
out
of
the
cascade
sour
tasting
of
the
four
we
dranksang
nior
sang
royal
the
vine
kriek
this
is
the
best
flanders
red
i
have
drank
to
date
i
dont
want
to
say
one
dimensional
ecause
that
would
be
doing
it
a
disservice
but
kriek
says
here
i
am
drink
me
just
puts
it
right
i
the
forefront
thanks
for
the
share
4daloveofstout
o
good
sour
but
actually
thought
this
would
have
a
little
more
cherry
flavor
then
it
did
would
purchase
and
drink
again
though
i
would
like
the
cherry
flavor
to
come
out
some
more
sours
are
exactly
my
favorite
style
so
i
need
to
get
more
of
the
fruity
flavor
its
well
made
and
i
am
sure
it
is
good
for
the
style
d
not
a
bad
beer
would
have
again
it
might
be
a
good
beer
for
the
stle
but
in
general
its
almost
not
drinkable
i
can
say
wholeheartedly
and
without
reservation
that
yes
indeedy
this
is
a
flanders
red
ale
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
with
the
nose
and
tart
flavor
profile
gradually
stepping
up
a
notch
the
lacto
is
present
and
noticeable
but
thankfully
it
does
not
hijack
the
whole
ride
and
merely
accents
on
the
back
side
this
is
quite
nice
quite
nice
a
really
well
done
production
that
pulls
off
a
difficult
style
long
live
the
american
brewer
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
wild
ales
sours
and
the
like
from
cascade
one
bottle
is
a
task
for
the
mouth
to
handle
really
makes
your
palate
work
overtime
great
sour
that
any
sour
fan
should
try
at
least
once
great
sour
that
starts
off
a
little
more
reserved
than
the
coveted
sang
noir
very
light
cherry
flavor
with
a
relaxed
sour
tartness
ive
been
finding
my
sour
tongue
and
this
is
a
good
one
if
youre
new
to
the
type
a
little
spendy
but
worth
it
everysooften
would
go
well
with
dessert
this
beer
is
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
into
sours
its
a
real
treat
and
worth
spending
the
1220
or
whatever
it
costs
in
your
area
even
if
you
are
to
have
it
only
once
pours
a
nice
mahogany
cherry
ale
with
a
mirrored
surface
smells
of
oak
cherry
and
hints
of
ink
really
flanders
like
in
the
nose
flavor
is
fucking
sour
with
cherry
and
more
sour
its
kinda
difficult
to
really
taste
anything
through
the
fleeting
barrage
of
acidity
medium
bodied
with
low
carb
and
a
mouth
watering
finish
this
beer
is
sour
i
enjoy
it
but
its
on
the
far
reach
of
sour
for
me
in
the
end
im
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
i
still
would
not
buy
it
again
at
20bottle
but
im
very
much
enjoying
this
one
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
cherries
vinegar
aromas
and
a
nice
level
of
funk
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
quality
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
really
tasty
and
sour
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
their
other
sour
offerings
its
crazy
how
different
the
09
and
10
can
be
ive
tried
them
side
by
side
at
multiple
ba
festivals
definitely
worth
checking
out
and
something
id
certainly
have
again
beer
is
thin
and
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
in
accented
by
a
strong
acetic
presence
it
is
difficult
to
drink
due
to
the
sourness
of
the
beer
it
is
just
too
much
for
me
and
not
a
likely
repeat
well
id
have
it
on
draft
at
the
barrel
house
o
a
pretty
good
representation
not
very
well
rounded
in
my
opinion
though
a
says
should
be
called
salivation
whoa
this
is
an
expensive
beer
and
frankly
one
that
is
overpriced
however
i
understand
the
amount
of
work
that
went
in
to
preparing
it
and
believe
it
was
quite
well
executed
it
was
worth
a
try
and
definitely
a
hard
beer
to
find
on
shelves
in
cny
o
fantastic
example
for
the
style
as
far
as
the
usa
goes
cascade
makes
outstanding
sours
and
this
is
no
exception
a
must
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
o
this
was
a
want
all
year
and
i
was
ecstatic
to
find
a
lone
bottle
while
on
vacation
in
a
state
largely
weak
on
beer
selection
i
bought
this
in
boston
during
my
belgian
beer
festivalthe
national
trip
2009
bottle
poured
a
bright
red
cherry
wood
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
it
sounds
fizzy
too
beige
head
is
small
and
short
lived
aroma
is
of
fresh
and
sour
cherries
on
first
sip
i
experience
dryness
and
tartiness
it
hits
ya
with
fresh
cherries
that
you
almost
think
will
be
sweet
then
it
cranks
up
the
tart
pucker
and
blows
you
away
and
dries
ya
out
theres
some
funk
and
theres
wood
the
feel
is
lightmoderate
with
some
nice
scrubbing
carbonation
this
is
tasty
definitely
a
nice
kriek
cant
comment
as
to
whether
it
has
earned
the
hype
since
i
dont
drink
enough
kriek
to
judge
o
a
great
sour
that
did
not
disappoint
will
be
taking
the
time
to
seek
this
out
again
overall
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
lots
of
big
complex
flavor
here
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
its
been
tough
to
find
good
sour
beers
on
the
shelves
recently
and
this
one
is
easy
to
find
so
if
im
in
the
mood
i
might
pick
one
up
but
id
rather
seek
out
a
better
example
of
the
style
to
my
mind
still
its
nice
and
i
will
gladly
polish
it
off
overall
this
is
a
unique
kriek
worthy
of
seeking
out
sweeter
and
less
sour
than
lambic
based
counterparts
well
balanced
and
quite
quaffable
the
beer
is
a
light
ruby
hue
and
moderately
hazy
small
off
white
head
with
copious
lacing
the
aroma
is
musty
and
funky
with
notes
of
oak
sour
cherries
and
wild
yeast
wow
intensely
sour
huge
presence
of
sour
cherries
soaking
in
oak
barrels
palate
attacking
cheek
assaulting
sourness
oh
yeah
loving
it
it
seems
aged
has
served
this
brew
quite
well
definitely
recommend
this
one
huzzah
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
to
date
this
might
be
my
favorite
flanders
red
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
well
balanced
and
not
overly
tart
or
sour
highly
recommended
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
really
a
fan
of
what
cascade
is
doing
in
their
barrel
room
this
was
a
great
example
of
a
solid
american
made
sour
really
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
o
very
well
done
o
a
really
solid
flanders
that
was
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
the
tart
cherries
and
acidity
are
perfect
and
make
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
need
to
stock
up
on
this
one
o
i
wish
i
wouldve
asked
for
more
solid
sour
a
great
beer
solid
cherry
flavour
and
the
tartness
doesnt
kill
it
great
beer
gkad
to
try
it
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
now
and
it
never
fails
to
impress
me
its
definitely
aggressive
with
the
sourness
at
times
but
never
bracingly
so
and
the
fresh
cherry
flavors
and
sharp
smoothness
of
the
body
really
help
keep
this
much
more
approachable
than
you
would
think
its
always
a
pleasure
with
a
glass
of
this
and
i
knew
that
getting
it
here
fresh
on
draft
was
a
must
another
delicious
offering
from
cascade
i
cant
wait
until
i
get
to
try
this
again
its
red
violet
color
are
nice
to
look
at
but
it
doesnt
form
much
of
a
head
or
lace
around
the
glass
the
nose
says
cherry
powder
and
some
tartness
what
makes
this
beer
great
in
its
taste
is
the
balance
of
its
characteristics
its
got
cherry
but
not
too
much
its
got
pucker
but
not
too
much
its
got
some
vinegar
but
not
too
much
its
got
tart
but
not
too
much
round
it
up
and
youve
got
one
more
outstanding
beer
to
come
from
the
doors
of
cascade
brewing
do
drinkability
is
pretty
high
although
this
is
bold
beer
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
cherries
and
sour
it
goes
down
quite
easily
and
doesnt
find
itself
battling
against
strong
vinegar
or
onion
notes
like
other
red
flanders
overall
enjoyed
this
a
lot
as
usual
but
not
necessarily
always
an
excellent
beer
from
these
guys
missing
the
barrel
house
greatly
o
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
flanders
style
by
an
american
brewery
i
was
shocked
to
find
this
on
the
shelves
as
i
didnt
know
they
had
some
distribution
in
massachusetts
im
intrigued
to
try
the
other
cascade
wilds
now
overall
it
seems
like
a
reasonable
example
of
the
style
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
something
interesting
and
different
with
flavors
you
dont
get
in
many
other
kinds
of
beer
o
as
usual
a
great
sour
from
cascade
love
their
stuff
o
continuing
my
liking
of
sour
ales
i
like
this
one
alot
the
last
few
sips
seem
more
like
a
gueuze
to
me
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
fizzy
level
of
carbonation
very
tangy
and
pleasantly
sour
it
seemingly
strips
the
moisture
from
your
tongue
which
urges
you
to
drink
more
there
is
hardly
any
alcohol
inclusion
and
this
certainly
ranks
up
there
with
one
of
the
more
sour
things
i
have
had
recently
this
red
ale
has
a
nice
balance
of
sour
w
gentle
cherry
tart
taste
that
mixes
with
some
slight
bitter
elements
and
vanilla
character
from
the
wood
i
like
the
slight
acicity
the
yeast
provides
with
a
subtle
toasted
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
kriek
with
very
good
drinkability
i
cant
fault
it
for
being
too
gentle
in
the
sour
department
really
since
it
fits
the
style
well
and
has
tasty
fruit
flavors
o
sessionable
sour
do
those
exist
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
out
there
not
overly
complex
or
drinkable
but
the
taste
is
killer
and
the
levels
of
sour
are
delightful
id
buy
this
in
large
quantities
if
possible
the
appearance
is
dark
pink
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
its
smell
has
cherry
wood
pear
a
bit
of
funk
a
sip
of
this
flanders
red
and
i
feel
this
is
more
sour
than
some
others
of
the
style
that
aspect
is
fine
by
me
and
more
of
those
cherries
are
still
present
lactic
tannins
hit
the
palate
through
the
taste
and
it
ends
with
some
dryness
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
is
great
to
quaff
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
a
great
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
d
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
bottle
and
it
came
through
for
me
nicely
there
is
an
immense
character
of
cherry
and
acid
throughout
with
enough
rich
malt
to
balance
and
even
push
back
against
the
tartness
at
times
in
the
end
the
beer
favors
the
acid
over
the
sugary
notes
as
it
should
and
this
makes
for
a
refreshing
beer
despite
its
relatively
high
abv
very
nice
reminds
me
of
a
blend
of
rodenbach
red
and
duchesse
overall
not
bad
my
least
favorite
cascade
but
still
decent
beer
nice
tart
cherry
flavors
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
though
bottle
from
2009
and
i
havent
a
clue
regarding
age
not
sure
how
this
ages
but
id
like
to
find
out
oa
good
bottle
but
i
can
already
feel
the
heartburn
creeping
in
should
be
shared
with
a
few
people
cascade
kriek
is
rather
intense
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
flanders
reds
or
sour
beers
in
general
this
one
might
be
a
little
much
for
you
im
enjoying
it
but
i
do
think
the
sour
aspect
is
just
a
little
too
intense
id
prefer
a
little
less
on
the
other
hand
im
not
much
of
a
cherry
fan
but
am
definitely
enjoying
that
aspect
of
it
the
cherry
flavor
is
simply
delicious
overall
its
good
stuff
well
worth
checking
out
thanks
a
ton
chris
overall
this
is
good
not
great
but
certainly
not
bad
i
enjoy
the
sourness

the

are
so
complimentary

its
ridiculous
tart

linger
on

as
the

mouthfeel
is
fullbodied

surprisingly
creamy
very

drinkability

overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
alcohol
is
undetectable
and
i
feel
3
years
has
done
great
things
for
this
beer
o
very
good
beer
was
pleasantly
impressed
with
this
one
and
enjoyed
the
taste
very
much
we
tore
through
this
bottle
quite
quickly
o
a
nicely
balanced
not
overpowering
sour
fruit
is
dry
and
subtlereally
nice
beer
o
i
think
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
flanders
red
in
an
over
the
top
american
way
d
a
potent
flanders
red
ale
with
a
little
bit
of
an
exceedingly
sour
kick
to
it
a
sipper
for
sure
challenges
the

a
very
fine
brew
none
the

makes
some
of
the
best

o
delicious
offering
all
the
sour
ales
from
these
guysgals
are
awesome
takes
on
the
styles
very
refreshing
and
delicious
but
definitely
not
for
sour
rooks
a
cool
alternative
to
higher
priced
sour
krieks
from
across
the
pond
this
one
is
almost
as
good
as
cantillon
or
russian
river
dvery
easy
drinking
and
rides
the
fine
line
between
sweet
and
sour
that
makes
it
very
palatable
this
is
such
a
nice
beer
i
just
wish
the
price
wasnt
so
high
however
it
is
nice
that
this
beer
is
readily
available
here
in
philly
d
a
fantastic
flanders
ale
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
still
comes
out
on
tap
as
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
a
joy
to
drink
and
enjoy
this
bottle
did
not
last
long
tonite
the
pour
was
wonderful
deep
and
dark
red
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
came
up
to
a
height
of
around
two
inches
before
settling
back
down
and
leaving
tons
of
lace
all
over
the
sides
and
bottom
of
the
glass
while
never
really
falling
much
below
the
one
inch
level
the
aroma
was
lightly
tart
sour
cherries
hints
of
earthy
and
spicy
notes
and
even
a
touch
of
what
seemed
like
brown
sugar
or
something
along
those
lines
really
very
well
done
and
quite
complex
the
flavor
was
a
little
less
tart
then
what
i
would
have
liked
but
i
have
to
admit
was
still
done
very
well
rich
and
full
it
was
never
flat
or
boring
and
i
have
to
admit
i
found
myself
returning
back
to
it
time
and
again
for
another
go
round
skål
this
is
a
great
flanders
sour
lots
of
flavor
that
is
spot
on
something
i
highly
recommend
overall
i
have
a
2009
that
i
saved
and
was
told
i
should
try
this
fresh
so
here
i
am
a
fantastic
flanders
and
am
glad
i
choose
to
open
this
up
tonight
and
have
another
to
sit
on
very
enjoyable
o
this
beer
is
an
experience
the
pop
i
heard
when
i
pulled
out
the
cork
was
one
of
the
loudest
ive
ever
heard
the
weird
smoky
discharge
from
the
bottle
was
a
dark
white
and
seemed
really
mystical
the
carbonation
on
the
pour
was
out
of
this
world
tastewise
the
beer
is
about
par
for
the
course
for
a
sour
nothing
extravagant
but
damn
good
and
worth
another
buy
o
fantastic
sour
cherry
flavor
i
could
drink
this
everyday
one
of
the
best
american
flanders
ive
tried
overall
good
sour
that
pleasantly
surprised
me
overall
it
was
pretty
great
in
my
book
a
little
high
on
the
price
tag
but
good
enough
that
i
am
going
to
try
to
get
more
of
their
beers
mouth
watering
pucker
finish
sour
but
not
too
much
to
me
this
beer
is
strikingly
similar
to
3f
our
kriek
delicious
and
an
excellent
offering
o
a
real
homerun
very
drinkable
very
delicious
overall
my
first
taste
of
a
raccoon
lodgecascade
beer
very
well
done
i
look
forward
to
trying
anything
they
do
in
the
future
pleasant
enough
and
quite
quaffable
cascades
kriek
is
a
fine
offering
though
it
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
of
other
cascade
offerings
as
well
as
other
awas
i
just
wish
there
were
a
little
more
balance
here
a
little
more
body
a
little
more
oak
a
little
more
brett
but
it
is
what
it
is
the
cpj
o
the
alc
is
not

very
drinkable
and

is
really
taking

will

putting

o
i
have
to
say
im
a
bit
surprised
about
this
one
pleasantly
for
whatever
reason
ok
its
probably
the
typical
20bottle
price
tag
on
the
cascade
beers
around
here
this
is
the
first
cascade
bottle
ive
opened
i
was
somewhat
expecting
to
be
disappointed
by
this
but
it
is
just
the
opposite
this
isnt
hardcore
sour
but
this
really
has
some
great
flavors
reminds
me
a
little
of
supplication
guess
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
o
sour
with
subtle
funk
fruit
and
caramel
with
generous
carbonation
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
suspect
that
the
time
spent
aging
this
one
added
quite
a
bit
to
the
experience
i
will
go
searching
for
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
2008
before
they
are
all
gone
cheers
a
good
effort
from
cascade
here
a
solidly
sour
kriek
a
pleasant
but
not
overwhelming
tartness
this
is
excellent
and
i
will
be
back
to
cascade
tomorrow
to
buy
some
more
my
suggestion
is
to
not
split
this
bottle
between
more
than
two
people
it
is
only
6
6
and
i
really
think
you
need
a
full
glass
to
allow
the
tartness
to
build
on
your
palate
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
this
has
been
my
2nd
cascade
ale
and
it
was
every
bit
delicious
very
intense
cherry
flavor
the
price
on
these
isnt
the
best
but
the
quality
is
the
texture
is
phenomenal
for
any
wild
but
really
hits
the
mark
for
a
flanders
red
it
starts
sweet
and
moves
to
earthy
with
a
drying
finish
there
is
no
hint
of
the
7

abv
enjoyable
throughout
i
would
like
to
pick
up
another
to
age
the
beer
is
tart
and
acidic
but
not
too
much
so
the
acid
really
comes
out
as
it
warms
reminds
me
of
a
light
champagne
with
fruit
overtones
very
drinkable
and
for
the
right
palate
a
great
session
beer
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
not
as
good
as
the
sang
rouge
but
enjoyable

isnt
too
much
to
handle
abv
wise
and
with
all
this
fruit
flavor
and
sour
sting
those
interested
in
the
tartest
of
the
tart
are
in
for
a
real
treat
my
first
cascade
runs
head
to
head
with
rrs
consecration
i
will
have
to
age
a
bottle
of
both
and
see
how
they
do
cheers
d
thanks
to
drfabulous
for
another
great
cellar
share
this
is
a
very
good
one
d
as
it
goes
with
this
style
it
depends
on
your
tolerance
for
sourness
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
suspect
this
kreik
ale
would
be
great
for
blending
with
another
ale
its
definitely
worth
thinking
about
in
the
future
di
am
downing
this
8
beer
like
what
but
i
would
like
to
try
a
younger
version
to
get
more
cherry
poured
a
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
pale
brown
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
finger
of
bubbly
head
and
good
retention
leaving
some
good
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
cherries
definitely
pop
out
on
the
aroma
with
some
oaky
character
slight
vinegar
and
faint
brown
sugar
vinous
notes
the
taste
was
also
big
on
the
cherries
with
vinegar
oaky
and
acidic
accents
but
had
some
really
good
tart
flavors
as
well
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
fruity
oaky
tart
and
mild
dry
finish
it
drank
really
good
and
was
glad
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
beer
cascade
is
doin
the
damn
thing
when
it
comes
to
sours
dthis
is
a
little
rough
overly
acidic
and
some
offf
putting
vinegar
flavors
the
cherries
are
very
strong
and
gives
it
a
nice
bit
of
sweetness
not
bad
but
rough
to
drink
very
nice
balanced
beer
not
overly
sour
the
malt
still
keeps
things
in
pace
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
some
lacto
sour
on
the
middle
and
finish
with
a
tinfoil
wrapped
bing
cherry
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
way
back
great
oaky
flavors
with
just
enough
tart
funk
in
the
middle
to
keep
it
quite
interesting
way
to
easy
to
drink
my
calendar
is
too
full
to
suffer
muddled
and
acidic
krieks
only
my
third
beer
from
this
brewery
and
like
the
previous
this
does
not
dissappoint
pours
a
light
brown
starting
fairly
clear
but
cloudy
by
the
last
glass
short
liveed
beige
head
with
sparse
lacing
the
cherries
do
present
themselves
in
the
aroma
and
it
is
very
much
in
line
with
flanders
reds
this
is
somewhat
lost
in
the
taste
however
much
like
the
new
belgium
la
folie
this
is
a
lactosour
bomb
and
that
is
about
the
extent
of
things
if
you
like
that
and
i
do
you
will
dig
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
drinkability
does
not
suffer
for
it
the
7
3
abv
stays
well
hidden
where
this
not
so
cost
prohibitive
i
would
have
no
problem
knocking
back
a
couple
of
these
excellent
beers
although
if
rodenbach
grand
cru
were
available
in
my
location
i
would
likely
not
buy
this
again
of
note
consumed
directly
after
leaving
belmont
station
and
drinking
three
russian
river
sours
consecration
supplication
temptation
though
the
rr
were
better
these
werent
far
off
drinkability
i
prefer
rodenbach
grand
cru
in
the
category
especially
with
cascades
higher
price
tag
id
pick
it
up
again
to
highlight
the
style
its
good
but
its
not
earth
shattering
tasty
and
chock
full
of
cherries
my
only
gripe
is
that
theres
very
little
brett
character
here
if
any
a
bit
two
dimensional
with
the
cherries
and
lacto
bring
on
the
funk
and
well
have
a
real
beaut
here

well
into
a
nice

nice

the
taste
is
rather
more

j
thought
given
the

a
subtle

hmmm
not
the
best
example
but
not
terrible
either
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
one
bottle
shouldnt
be
a
problem
but
i
would
recommend
sharing
with
friends
lots
of
lambic
qualities
in
this
beer
heavy
on
the
tart
sour
cherries
light
on
the
oaky
wood
highly
recommended
d
as
with
most
sours
a
large
bottle
of
this
kriek
is
best
when
shared
as
its
powerful
and
challenging
sensory
qualities
can
fatigue
the
palate
it
is
perhaps
best
appreciated
when
compared
to
a
few
other
similar
beersrussian
river
supplication
and
rodenbach
grand
cru
for
example
this
beer
by
cascade
is
less
sour
than
supplication
and
has
a
greater
fruit
presence
it
features
less
of
the
barrel
qualities
than
the
rodenbach
but
more
harsh
acidity
the
bright
sour
flavor
and
lingering
acid
burn
makes
this
beer
more
similar
to
supplication
d
i
really
like
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
big
sour
kick
but
provides
a
nice
subtle
sweet
fruity
flavor
as
well
the
fruit
flavor
really
is
top
notch
in
this
compared
to
cantillon
kriek
i
think
this
has
more
fruit
flavor
but
less
funk
and
sour
notes
fantastic
brew
i
am
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
will
have
to
pick
up
more
of
this
fantastic
beer

cherry
and
cherry
also
some
green
apples

the
taste
is
dark
and
bright
cherries
with
a
really
nice
sourness
level
and
a
bit
of
funk
the
feel
is
quite
good
with
some
puckering
lactic
sourness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
acetic
character
drinks
quite
well
and
is
another
solid
hit
from
them
d
very
bright
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
very
bright
and
it
flavorful
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
another
glass
cascade
kriek
ale
is
not
as
good
as
the
only
other
raccoon
lodge
and
brewpubcascade
brewing
beer
that
ive
had
to
date
cascade
sang
royal
its
well
worth
the
purchase
price
though
for
those
of
you
who
cant
get
enough
of
sour
cherry
beer
pucker
up
drink
very
good
sour
many
fruit
sours
are
difficult
to
drink
but
this
one
is
just
smooth
and
balanced
enough
that
i
could
easily
finish
a
750
ml
bottle
on
my
own
drinkability
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
i
think
i
get
the
gist
after
one
glass
just
a
bit
too
much
too
handle
more
than
one
of
d
a
must
try
due
to
just
how
sour
it
is
but
not
a
beer
that
i
will
consume
all
that
much
of
very
interesting
but
maybe
just
a
tad
over
the
line
smokey
overall
i
would
drink
this
bad
boy
again
and
again
nearly
rivals
the
deliciousness
of
hanssens
oude
kriek
but
just
requires
a
little
more
complexity
just
a
teeny
bit
overall
great
sour
ale
on
a
side
note
this
seems
like
beer
that
could
definitely
hold
up
to
additional
cellaring
with
ease
this
is
almost
too
sour
and
not
very
cherry
but
it
is
good
definitely
fun
in
the
mouth
and
worth
the
wow
factor
drinkability
really
nice
beer
the
cherry
is
nice
and
evident
and
a
bit
fruitier
than
im
used
to
in
wild
ales
usually
in
these
american
lambics
the
vanilla
and
oak
are
more
evident
than
the
brews
across
the
pond
this
one
is
a
bit
different
as
the
wood
is
subdued
and
the
beer
is
slightly
more
sour
great
stuff
here
thanks
much
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
amber
with
a
light
tan
and
sticky
head
that
leaves
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
slightly
funky
and
tart
but
with
decent
dose
of
sweetness
as
well
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
nose
i
personally
dont
pick
up
a
huge
cherry
aroma
it
is
fruity
for
sure
but
reminds
me
more
of
apple
or
pear
the
taste
is
puckeringly
sour
its
a
sour
patch
kid
like
acidic
tartness
and
is
not
really
all
that
funky
or
musty
much
like
the
nose
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
real
cherry
like
flavors
and
it
is
just
generically
fruity
and
quite
sugary
from
the
malt
bill
it
tastes
good
but
on
the
other
hand
i
wish
that
there
was
more
going
on
than
just
an
enjoyable
sourfest
in
my
mouth
as
the
beer
warms
i
am
able
to
pick
out
some
nice
woody
tannins
but
they
are
buried
pretty
far
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
dry
but
does
not
get
too
sticky
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
except
for
in
the
nose
i
just
cant
help
thinking
that
overall
this
beer
is
lacking
something
that
could
take
it
to
the
next
level
a
very
fine
beer
especially
for
sour
beer
lovers
quite
impressive
d
liked
it
great
balance
tasty
and
pretty
refreshing
alcohol
is
dangerously
hidden
for
7
no
problem
curing
the
sourcraving
drinkable
and
tasty
at
least
if
you
like
your
beers
sour
lately
this
style
has
been
the
hot
thing
in
craft
beer
and
it
now
seems
that
ive
gotta
keep
an
eye
out
for
other
beers
from
raccoon
lodge
drinkability
is
nice
but
a
filling
beer
overall
d
very
good
at
only
7
3
could
def
enjoy
a
few
of
these
not
bad
but
definitely
not
blown
away
shared
with
a
friend
and
am
glad
would
not
have
enjoyed
another
12oz
of
this
beer
id
definitely
try
other
years
of
this
beer
as
well
as
other
beers
from
this
brewery
definitely
got
me
curious
d
not
overly
sour
with
good
balancing
elements
and
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
very
easy
drinking
i
finished
the
bomber
it
will
be
awhile
till
my
tongue
heals
enough
but
i
will
do
this
again
di
should
have
shared
this
bottle
the
sourness
is
getting
to
be
a
bit
much
that
said
i
did
enjoy
the
beer
nice
cherry
flavor
d
rated
high
as
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
would
have
again
i
felt
this
did
the
still
quite
well
the
body
should
either
be
thinner
or
the
beer
should
be
more
carbonated
this
may
be
a
tough
one
to
get
through
the
whole
750ml
but
i
think
ill
make
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
you
dont
even
realize
there
is
alcohol
in
your
glass
i
had
an
almost
3
year
old
nb
la
folie
a
few
days
ago
that
had
similar
qualities
but
the
nb
was
a
bit
more
enjoyable
i
plan
to
get
another
of
these
to
age
and
see
how
it
goes
i
do
like
this
beer
drinkability
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
in
the
category
aging
might
help
this
beer
alot
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
pours
a
hazy
red
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
some
lacing
and
a
little
bit
of
sediment
smells
pretty
much
of
straight
up
cherries
very
nice
the
taste
is
of
sour
cherries
with
some
apple
in
there
too
nicely
carbonated
very
good
mouthfeel
and
was
able
to
drink
all
750
mls
by
myself
highly
recommended
d
well
this
is
one
hell
of
a
flanders
the
cherries
while
clearly
present
never
over
take
the
red
ale
super
refreshing
and
ill
be
seeking
out
more
d
very
crisp
and
refreshing
but
not
something
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
pass
the
antacid
please
split
with
5
people
after
dinner
at
a
tapas
bar
perfect
as
a
digestif
nightcap
d
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
better
flanders
reds
out
there
and
if
i
want
cherries
ill
take
a
real
kriek
j
pours
a
dark
red
almost
brown
color
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
lacing
overall
a
nice
looking
beer
in
the
smell
i
can
definitely
pick
up
cherries
mostly
dark
overripe
sweet
cherries
nice
and
fleshy
but
there
is
a
little
tarness
in
there
i
also
get
a
nice
big
whiff
of
gym
sock
pretty
funky
the
smell
is
pretty
good
the
taste
of
course
starts
out
with
cherries
and
it
has
a
bit
of
tartness
a
nice
subdued
tartness
but
theres
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
the
beer
is
not
too
acidic
either
the
acidity
is
quite
subdued
i
can
taste
a
little
malt
and
theres
a
slight
toastiness
which
is
different
and
nice
the
funkiness
of
the
smell
doesnt
translate
directly
to
the
taste
but
i
do
get
some
lingering
funkiness
musty
fruit
a
little
straw
and
a
finish
that
has
a
nice
blend
of
sweetness
and
tartness
the
body
is
medium
thin
with
decent
carbonation
its
smooth
and
mellow
and
the
alcohol
is
not
incredibly
noticable
its
pretty
good
actually
a
little
refreshing
im
surprised
to
say
and
the
bit
of
toastiness
keeps
it
interesting
still
a
litle
too
strong
and
rich
for
another
beer
afterwards
do
not
drink
this
at
fridge
temp
i
started
to
and
then
stopped
because
the
fridgid
temps
really
mask
the
great
fruit
flavors
and
the
tartness
and
carbonation
dominates
once
its
at
perfect
temp
for
drinking
the
sour
cherries
are
light
but
just
enough
to
please
the
tartness
is
still
very
strong
and
dominates
throughout
a
slight
funkiness
and
pretty
potent
acidic
notes
provides
and
awesome
comparison
in
complexity
light
and
crisp
carbonated
and
very
yummy
poured
into
a
tulip
and
really
glad
to
have
gotten
my
hands
on
this
beer
ruby
red
color
with
slightly
reddish
head
tight
bubbles
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
aromas
initially
of
lactic
sourness
big
time
basement
and
some
faint
cherry
as
the
beer
warms
more
cherry
aroma
becomes
apparent
and
the
sour
aroma
calms
a
little
the
flavor
is
bracingly
tart
a
good
thing
other
flavors
from
the
oak
and
malty
body
again
as
the
beer
breaths
cherry
beomces
more
pronounced
grassy
hoppiness
is
very
faint
but
there
way
more
kriek
then
sour
red
thats
for
sure
not
much
risidual
sweetness
at
all
feels
effervecent
in
the
mouth
nicely
bubbly
this
beer
sits
on
your
tongue
for
some
time
long
lasting
aftertaste
would
get
a
higher
drinkability
score
but
its
just
so
tart
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
i
would
have
no
problem
finishing
this
brew
myself
overall
my
5
or
so
ounce
pour
wasnt
nearly
enough
for
me
this
and
the
barrel
aged
blackbeerd
were
the
stars
of
the
night
skal
drinkability
high
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
could
have
been
better
after
having
the
apricot
offering
first
this
brewery
is
should
be
the
next
big
thing
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
however
its
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
and
could
use
a
hair
more
body
however
if
this
was
readily
available
to
me
and
a
hair
cheaper
i
would
drink
it
often
2008
vintage
the
beer
pours

the

the

more
of
the

bottle
thanks
to
sincerenc
i
split
this
with
a
couple
friends
and
it
was
pretty
good
dark
and
cloudy
red
with
a
sour
cherry
aroma
to
it
the
flavor
was
acidic
and
sour
and
also
had
interesting
cherry
flavors
which
balanced
out
the
beer
nicely
the
alcohol
was
well
restrained
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
it
were
not
so
expensive
d
this
another
outstanding
sour
from
cascade
just
really
well
made
the
body
was
on
the
thin
side
of
average
for
the
these
types
of
beers
drinkability
is
very
good
if
youre
into
the
sours
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
worth
your
time
if
you
like
palate
wreckingly
sour
brews
youve
had
fair
notice
d
probably
one
of
if
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
its
style
this
one
is
truly
different
from
its
peers
for
the
amout
of
fruit
present
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
cherries
are
unmistakable
here
and
creates
a
beer
that
isnt
just
tart
and
sour
simply
fantastic
and
im
grateful
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
d
this
is
a
delicious
and
easy
drinking
kriek
and
i
wish
this
wasnt
my
only
bottle
d
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
perhaps
the
best
of
the
cascade
sours
despite
its
wide
availability
pours
a
solid
hazy
amber
with
fluffy
cream
head
beautiful
aroma
of
lemon
raisin
and
cherry
touch
of
honey
on
the
tongue
and
then
an
amazing
cherry
tartness
incredible
balance
of
sweet
fruit
flavor
with
a
good
sourness
good
carb
on
this
one
unlike
a
couple
other
cascades
which
are
a
bit
lively

body
with
mild
funk
and
tart
finish
id
been
waiting
to
try
something
from
this
brewery
for
ages
and
am
very
happy
to
have
cracked
this
open
my
expectations
were
easily
met
if
not
exceeded
this
is
a
superior
domestic
version
of
the
style
and
i
find
myself
on
the
edge
of
rating
it
higher
but
it
strikes
me
as
just
a
tiny
bit
too
simplistic
compared
to
the
very
best
examples
excellent
beer
the
alcoholic
in
me
has
figured
out
that
for
the
price
of
one
red
poppy
i
get
thrice
as
much
alcohol
in
this
beer
and
while
its
not
a
fair
comparison
its
a
beer
id
gladly
consume
much
more
frequently
in
some
ways
the
explosive
fruit
character
brings
to
mind
a
fresher

d
id
heard
mixed
reviews
of
this
beer
but
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
id
be
happy
to
have
this
one
again
a
notb
highlight
certainly
not
worth
the
price
that
i
paid
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
great
dgoodnot
a
crazy

brewbut
solid
nice
tartness
and
a
very
real
bing
cherry
flavour
quite
nice
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
drinkability
a
wonderful
flavor
and
an
even
better
nose
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
the
beer
could
have
used
just
a
little
more
malt
on
the
backbone
to
raise
the
body
although
i
personally
wouldnt
want
any
more
malt
flavor
in
it
the
alcohol
didnt
show
itself
during
a
single
sip
of
this
overall
this
beer
wasnt
as
sourgood
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
not
to
the
style
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
good
but
just
not
great
because
it
lacks
flavors
lightly
sour
and
pleasant
very
drinkable
and
elegant
although
could
be
more
sour
and
flavors
could
be
a
bit
brighter
for
my
personal
taste
the
taste
too
is
focused
on
cherries
theyre
slightly
sweet
and
lightly
tart
with
a
dash
of
unripe
cherry
skins
wood
notes
are
faint
in
the
background
and
acetic
character
is
at
an
upper
low
level
with
no
brettanomyces
and
with
lactobacillus
as
the
only
bacteria
the
sourness
is
clean
and
theres
no
funk
to
speak
of
the
resulting
flavor
is
pretty
straight
forward
but
the
quality
of
the
fruit
makes
this
immensely
enjoyable
tart
and
crisp
with
and
airy
freshness
cherries
of
course
and
some
nutmegclove
spice
definitely
a
sipper
yet
another
american
brewer
that
gets
it
when
it
comes
to
belgian
beer
you
have
to
wonder
what
a
few
years
of
cellaring
will
do
to
this
beer
either
way
its
good
while
it
lasts
seek
this
one
out
quite
acidic
cherry
with
a
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
a
real
treat
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
despite
the
8
wish
i
had
some
this
truely
is
one
of
the
best
krieks
out
there
medium
body
has
a
delicate
carbonation
nice
acidic
finish
great
flanders
red
from

another
fantastic
sour
from
cascade
this
one
is
a
big
drinkable
among
the
others
much
like
the
apricot
but
even
better
in
drinkablility
doesnt
touch
the
sang
royal
though
all
kinds
of
funk
and
nice
and
tart
its
not
as
sour
as
rgc
but
still
great
highly
carbonated
the
cherry
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
perfect
imo
the
aroma
is
unbelievably
complex
i
love
the
cheesycherry
taste
if
you
want
tearbringing
sourness
look
elsewhere
this
is
not
a
fruit
beer
this
is
a
beer
with
some
fruit
bottle
from
boston
town
a
well
done
flanders
red
sourish
with
good
cherry
taste
always
well
malted
good
to
share
as
even
a
third
of

is
a
bunch
of
sourness
dark
reddish

and
spider
lacey
above

a

this
is

first

ive
tried
but
i
have
a
few
in
my
basement
still
and
after
trying
this
one
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
also
pretty
drinkable
a
good
beer
overall
bottle
poured
a
murky
red

ale
with
a
rather
large
foamy

with

and
some

of

cherries
with
some
lightly
sweet
notes
and
some
tannin
and
oak
notes
are
also
discernible
taste
is
a
very
well
balance
mix
between
some
tart
notes
sour
cherries
with
underlying
sweetness
and
some
light
tannin
and
oak
notes
body
is
about
average
with

no

very

not
a

its

this
beer

pretty

i

i
had
more
to
try
it
out
for
longer

worth
checking
out

flavor
is
not
really
that
robust

is

just
a

glad
kersta
sent
me
a
bottle
of
this
i
wont
be
sharing
mine
d
pretty
good
kriek
overall
although
not
a
lot
of
sourness
compared
to
other
krieks
ive
had
still
this
one
offers
a
pleasant
cherry
flavor
i
was
actually
disappointed
with
this
one
worth
trying
but
i
dont
think
i
would
grab
this
one
again
at
20
a
750
ml
notes
from
and
tasted
on
52109
this
does
get
a
little
hefty
to
knock
down
the
complexity
is
a
weight
unto
itself
but
its
so
damn
good
nonetheless
am
diggin
this

wicked
fierce
my
bottle
says
8

above
it
says
6

so
mine
is
different
8
1
is
very
unusual
for
a
lambic
i
guess
since
its
an
american
interpretation
it
makes
sense
this
is
the
tastiest
kriek
i
have
had
08
vintage
clearish
rubyamber
appearance
with
a
shortlived
offwhite
head
massive
sweettart
cherry
aroma
like
a
slice
of
freshly
baked
cherry
pie
very
faint
funk
and
oak
beneath
that
this
one
is
more
about
the
fruit
similar
on
the
palate
intensely
fruity
with
mild
sourness
and
tannins
dry
tart
mouthfeel
with
crisp
carbonation
like
cascades
apricot
ale
the
kriek
has
an
expressive
fruit
character
but
very
restrained
acidity
and
sourness
people
expecting
a
palatelacerating
wild
ale
will
be
disappointed
but

a
good
job

base
beer
is
a
blend
of
flanders
red
styles
bringing
out
some
lactic
notes
a
sharp
tartness
and
a
hint
of
wet
oak
the
cherries
add
a
piefilling
real
fruit
kick
but
subtle
and
present
mostly
in
the
end
of
the
sip
like
i
imagined
this
beer
has
flavor
from
ng
belgian
red
just
enough
to
make
a
flanders
red
with
fruit
notes
despite
big
complex
flavors
this
beer
lacks
any
overbearing
qualities
which
make
it
extremely
drinkable
super
beer
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
not
the
normal
kriek
you
have
that
is

this
is
very
solid
and
highly
recommended

the
beer
tastes
of
tart
dry
cherries
up
front
but
this
is
only
one
component
of
the
flavor
there
is
also
a
lacticacid
driven
lemonlike
not
up
front
that
moves
to
a
fleshy
full
cherry
skin
flavor
that
couples
with
a
tannic
finish
the
tannic
note
provides
a
light
astringency
in
the
finish
but
i
cant
quite
help
coming
back
to
the
fresh
complex
even
cherry
flavor
that
is
not
overly
dominant
but
is
so
aromatic
tasting
if
that
makes
any
sense
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
could
be
a
touch
more
funky
it
showed
some
promise
of
this
in
the
aroma
as
it
is
mostly
sour
but
it
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
cascade
kriek
is
a
worthy
tribute
to
the
lambic
cherry
style
my
first
glass
was
clear
sunset
amber
but
subsequent
servings
poured
out
with
greater
turbidity
it
is
not
sweet
and
candylike
but
bracing
acidic
and
complementary
to
a
host
of
foods
a
curious
wash
of
cinnamon
emerges
after
some
warming
making
the
beer
nonetoochallenging
to
appreciate
at
17
50
a
bottle
it
aint
cheap
but
the
process
of
producing
ales
of
this
sort
lends
an
obvious
justification
to
the
expense
and
its
overall
quality
is
worth
the
infrequent
indulgence
drinkability
quite
nice
pleasantly
fruity
and
all
kinds
of
refreshing
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
i
thought
i
would
drinkability
better
than
the
blackberry
i
just
love
the
way
this
brewer
combines
the
american
fruit
with
the
belgian
funk
kudos
drinkability
was
high
for
me
i
really
have
been
enjoying
racoons
sour
beers
and
cant
applaud
them
enough
for
continuing
to
produce
them
something
very
few
pdx
brewers
are
doing
of
the
three
in
this
series
this
is
my
second
favorite
behind
the
apricot
trippel
and
in
front
of
the
blackberry
though
all
of
them
are
good
cant
wait
until
there
next
few
come
out
the
cuvee
in
particular
will
really
be
a
treat
i
didnt
factor
in
availability
or
cost
but
this
is
expensive
and
limited
which
of
course
means
im
not
drinking
it
by
the
case
although
i
wish
i
was
this
is
a
topnotch
beer
never
been
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
has
won
me
over
o
i
am
fairly
new
to
the
style
but
this
speaks
to
me
the
flavours
are
bold
but
friendly
and
generally
inviting
an
interesting
beer
but
i
probably
wont
purchase
again
at
the
price
its
sold
for
in
the
ontario
lcbo
over
11
o
well
balanced
masterpiece
more
woody
malty
earthy
tones
than
cherry
in
comparison
to
goudenband
love
the
earthiness
and
bitterness
of
malt
this
one
has
love
sours
would
go
well
with
cherry
pie
great
to
sip
would
also
match
well
with
creamy
cheeses
totally
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
even
if
it
is
not
for
everyone
o
interesting
beer
i
suspect
this
one
might
be
better
paired
with
food
or
used
for
cooking
overall
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
enthralling
me
either
a
very
nice
red
ale
with
an
italian
twist
overall
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
sharp
interesting
and
unexpected
flavour
make
it
something
i
could
see
in
a
food
pairing
maybe
with
cheese

an
a
panil
barriquee
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
sour
and
speaking
from
experience
seems
to
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
newbies
like
me
the
balance
between
the
tartness
of
the
various
fruit
flavoursacetic
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
is
nothing
short
of
excellent
to
say
nothing
of
the
masterfullycloaked
abv
or
the
pleasant
woodiness
of
the
profile
or
the
fact
that
it
is
tasty
both
when
chilled
and
after
warming
up
to
room
temperature
im
still
not
convinced
that
sours
are
up
my
alley
but
i
found
myself
with
nothing
but
compliments
for
this
highly
quaffable
example
highly
recommended
and
something
i
may
get
again
some
time
o
its
a
sour
beer
within
whats
expected
of
a
traditional
flanders
red
ale
very
balanced
and
rich
with
good
enough
complexity
almost
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
its
slightly
puckering
acidity
is
paired
with
mild
tannic
astringency
a
tasty
and
approachable
sour
ale
with
some
winelike
qualities
i
loved
the
taste
and
had
little
to
complain
about
in
other
areas
i
wish
i
could
read
italian
because
im
curious
to
what
went
in
to
this
beer
and
im
too
lazy
to
type
it
all
in
too
google
translate
oh
well
thanks
again
liamt07
for
sending
the
bottle
o
overall
a
tasty
sample
of

worth
seeking
out
definitely
glad
that
the
lcbo
is
broadening
its
selection
and
bringing
in
a
greater
variety
of
styles
overall
good

hitter

nonetheless
taste
has
some
tart
cherries
with
a
big

light

and
some

spicing
does

to
come
in

even
the
the

some

lightly

some

nice

and
it
was
a
good
idea
to
split
this
one
truly
the
first
flanders
red
ive
ever
enjoyed
very
good
stuff
this
is
the
italian
version
the

is
completely

it
is

not

really
enjoyed
the

was
the
highlight
of
that
nights
tasting
o
this
is
a
must
for
sour
enthusiasts
though
i
would
caution
that
there
is
either
a
great
deal
of
batch
or
bottle
variance
older
batches
than

may
not
be

a
decent
amount
of
head
tastes
very
sour
as
i
am
not
very
fimiliar
with
this
style
definately
has
a
sour
candy
like
taste
this
bottle
isnt
that
bad
of
a
struggle
to
finish
myself
as
i
was
a
little
worried
about
decent
drinkability
its
pretty
refreshing
too
i
might
consider
another
bottle
if
there
is
any
left
on
the
shelves
here
at
the
lcbo
dvery
drinkable
cost
is
prohibitive
though
lol
overall
average
not
the
best
sour
ive
had
not
the
worst
d
its
tough
to
come
to
a
final
conclusion
there
are
parts
of
this
beer
that
i
really
liked
and
parts
that
i
didnt
at
18
i
feel
its
quite
overpriced
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
it
is
quite
older
d
a
pretty
good
flanders
ale
i
thought
it
smelled
amazing
and
had
some
great
sour
fruit
and
wine
to
it
would
definitely
have
again
a
nicely
balanced
ale
among
the
tartness
funk
and
grain
an
extremely
good
flemish
red
better
than
many
belgian
examples
ive
had
and
its
from
italy
very
odd
but
quite
tasty
i
wish
i
could
get
this
back
in
texas
great
looking
ale
a
rich
brown
with
amber
tints
the
nose
has
sweet
malts
tart
fruits
oak
and
musky
funk
taste
has
sweet
caramel
malts
balanced
by
sour
fruit
oak
and
a
subtle
barnyard
manure
presence
medium
body
with
delicate
carbonation
great
example
of
the
style
from
this
italian
brewery
well
balanced
indeed
certainly
better
than
rodenbach
classic
and
a
little
better
than
duchesse
less
vinegar
and
less
sweet
this
is
a
wonderful
flanders
red
from
the
boot
and
one
of
the
best
in
its
class
this
happens
to
be
one
of
those
beers
i
always
like
to
have
at
least
one
bottle
in
the
house
at
all
times

cherries
more
vanilla

it

mellows
out
then
but
still
introduces
itself
each
sip
sour
fruity
and
oaky

medium

high
level
of

could
drink
a
few
more
glasses
of
this
not
too
sour
or
sweet

smell
or
flavor
is
not
overbearing
goes
down
easy
and
can
even
be
refreshing
this
is
a
great
italian
beer
and
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
future
it
has
a
nice
sourness
from
the
lactobacillus
should
definitely
check
it
out
opinion
i
am
rather
impressed
with
this
beer
it
not
quite
a
rodenbach
or
anything
but
it
is
still
a
contender
with
those
incredible
beers
the
overall
presentation
of
this
beer
has
been
very
pleasant
for
me
and
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
i
would
put
it
into
the
category
of
a
starter
flanders
if
there
was
such
a
thing
it
isnt
as
assertive
as
i
like
them
but
it
a
world
class
beer
nonetheless
drinking
this
was
almost
psychologically
refreshing
for
me
having
reviewed
smaller
styles
for
quite
a
while
at
16
per
bottle
i
would
put
this
fabulous
beer
up
against
any
wine
at
a
similar
price
panil
brews
a
wonderful
flanders
and
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
this
again
d
a
bit
but
i
dont
drink
this
style
for
the
drinkability
drinkability
was
pretty
good
even
though
i
prefer
them
much
more
sour
and
wish
this
2006
vintage
had
another
2
years
on
it
very
nice
pairing
with
steaks
i
compared
it
to
my
wifes
bordeaux
and
it
by
far
exceeded
it
which
really
shocked
me
this
was
bottle

from
batch

brewed
in
2007
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
reddish
brown
topped
by
a
wispy
beige
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
is
very
sour
with
acidic
earthy
and
lightly
medicinal
notes
from
the
moment
it
hits
the
tongue
this
beer
is
sour
throughout
there
are
hints
of
cherry
fruitiness
a
slight
medicinal
character
and
an
earthiness
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
dry
finish
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
incredibly
smooth
despite
the
sourness
it
beats
rodenbach
easily
an
excellent
example
of
the
flemish
sour
style
an
extreme
example
in
fact
this
one
has
a
very
strong
acidic
backbone
a
sort
of
geuzevinegar
sourness
sporadic
herbalfarmhouse
notes
some
oak
and
bourbon
in
the
background
but
not
so
much
as
to
distract
from
the
sublime
acidity
poured
a
light
coppery
color
this
is
one
to
take
your
time
with
enjoy
it
drinkability
despite
the

that

it
was
at

so
not

what
happened
the
smell
was
pretty
good
with
sour
cherries
and
oaky
vanilla
but
was
a
little
weak
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
but
was
weaker
than
i
expected
the
taste
and
the

both

this
is
weird

perhaps
not
as
weird
as
i
expected
there
are
some
nice
sour
and
funky
notes
here
but
it
also
tastes
simultaneously
too
old
and
too
young
maybe
this
was
not
the
best
year
i
might
try
this
again
its
a
soured
version
of
the
barrel
it
lived
in
could
stand
to
dry
out
a
little
and
pick
up
a
bit
more
of
a
tart
edge
but
the
base
flavors
are
in

pick
up
a

sit

this
beer
needs
its
own
category
truly
a
unique
and
wonderful
creation
o
not
bad
coming
from
italy
one
of
the
more
delicate
subdued
examples
of
the
style
obviously
well
made
but
lacking
life
a
little
reminded
me
most
of
a
darkertasting
rodenbach
grand
cru
the
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
muddled
pink
almost
like
a
fruited
berliner
weisse
it
sits
in
the
glass
a
regal
dark
purple
color
with
maroon
and
ruby
hues
the
beer
pours
with
a
head
of
miniscule
creamy
white
bubbles
that
form
a
pillow
and
then
quickly
settles
into
a
fat
scrim
around
the
beer
in
body
the
beer
is
dark
and
hazy
but
clear
of
particles
and
cloudiness
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
light
vinegar
cherries
leather
and
nearly
vinous
touches
of
grape
and
soft
plum
dance
on
the
edges
of
the
scent
along
with
rich
vanilla
from
the
oak
the
funky
leather
and
cherry
scents
are
earthy
and
rich
with
vinegar
which
i
adore
but
they
are
also
constrained
and
mellow
the
nose
of
this
beer
revels
in
subtle
complexity
it
is
funky
but
not
in
a
way
that
would
kick
your
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
tart
with
acidity
sweet
with
fruity
malt
and
bitter
with
oak
tannin
the
oak
leaves
a
strange
twinge
to
the
pucker
in
your
cheeks
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
tannic
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
plum
juice
tinged
with
tart
cherry
leather
this
bulls
head
on
into
a
wall
of
rich
oak
tannin
that
blankets
the
middle
of
the
sip
all
but
obliterating
the
fruity
notes
and
bringing
vanilla
earth
and
finally
a
touch
of
chocolate
into
play
touches
of
grape
juice
and
rich
red
wine
can
also
be
sensed
in
the
start
of
the
sip
while
the
finish
is
long
and
decadent
with
oak
vanilla
touches
of
tart
grapes
and
bitter
herbal
tannin
the
aftertaste
is
hard
to
distinguish
from
the
finish
as
the
beer
has
tremendous
lasting
power
in
the
mouth
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
are
the
same
in
body
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
a
middling
carbonation
that
gives
a
nice
pillow
to
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
smooth
if
a
bit
watery
providing
superb
drinkability
until
the
beer
hits
the
back
of
the
palate
in
the
back
the
tannin
does
touch
with
a
quick
bite
of
astringency
but
this
quickly
fades
to
just
leave
a
bit
of
tightness
in
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
with
just
a
touch
of
saliva
oozing
in
to
cancel
the
lingering
acidity
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
yet
another
superb
flanders
red
this
particular
beer
revels
in
the
rich
character
it
gained
from
unique
bordeaux
cognac
barrels
admittedly
i
have
not
drank
a
lot
of
cognac
from
bordeaux
i
thought
cognac
could
only
be
made
in
a
region
surrounding
the
town
of
cognac
but
i
think
an
experienced
cognac
drinker
would
definitely
find
subtle
hints
within
this
beer
reminiscent
of
that
drink
this
is
a
flanders
red
of
subtle
intrigue
and
beauty
like
a
fine
red
wine
it
unfurled
on
my
tongue
like
a
puzzle
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
that
my
chief
complaint
with
the
beer
comes
from
its
thinness
i
want
my
flanders
reds
to
be
medium
bodied
and
this
one
is
just
a
little
too
far
below
this
bench
mark
for
me
it
is
superbly
drinkable
but
loses
a
little
oomf
the
beers
tannic
structure
also
allows
it
to
grip
the
mouth
quite
nicely
and
provides
some
amazing
complexities
though
it
is
a
little
too
raw
for
my
personal
tastes
in
the
end
though
its
a
great
flanders
red
overall
a
very
good
flanders
red
ale
my
only
critique
is
that
it
might
be
a
little
onedimensional
but
its
still
very
enjoyable
overall
very
good
but
maybe
not
outstanding
enough
to
be
excellent
its
fairly
subtle
with
good
but
not
great
depth
very
nice
and
worth
drinking
very
good
sour
made
in
italy
the
italian
beer
scene
has
really
made
its
mark
and
this
is
one
offering
that
helps
support
that
cause
next
time
a
wine
drinker
reaches
for
a
pinot
noir
to
go
with
a
chicken
or
salmon
dish
this
could
probably
be
swapped
out

like
it
much
better
this
time
still
pretty
ugly
but
a
nice
sourness
to
go
along
with
the
sweet
black
cherry
flavor
oak
and
very
nice
sourness
going
on
big
chewy
oak
here
intermingled
with
nice
tart
cherry
fruits
very
nice
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
really
solid
to
style
with
good
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
that
being
said
i
defiantly
want
to
see
how
it
can
develop
with
a
few
years
on
it
as
it
was
not
very
sour
and
a
lot
more
juicy
then
tart
if
it
develops
how
i
think
it
could
it
could
make
this
beer
a
lot
beer
but
for
now
its
good
but
tacking
in
some
aspects
especially
in
strength
of
taste
though
the
feel
is
pretty
good
i
would
recommend
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
overall
a
different
take
on
a
flemish
red
the
tartness
seems
very
toned
down
by
the
extensive
oak
aging
cognac
barrels
probably
are
the
root
cause
still
a
nice
and
easy
sipper
but
not
nearly
as
complex
and
bold
as
other
reds
othis
brew
is
a
winner
i
like
the
oaky
subtle
complexity
of
it
all
there
are
beers
with
more
pucker
power
and
this
beer
clearly
does
not
try
to
hit
you
over
the
head
with
acid
instead
this
one
really
shines
in
the
use
of
oak
to
give
an
dry
earthy
complex
tartness
a
complex
and
drinkable
example
of
the
style
o
overall
this
was
a
darn
good
flanders
red
which
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
always
see
this
in
stores
glad
i
got
to
try
it
ive
increased
my
overall
score
by
25
to
reflect
what
i
feel
is
more
accurate
o
not
as
sour
as
some
other
beers
in
the
category
ive
had
its
still
well
done
and
definitely
delivers
that
lip
puckering
goodness
that
i
sometimes
crave

a

the

is

beer
that
finds
itself
getting

overall
providing
the
excitement
of

flanders
red
while
in
the
vein
of
rodenbach
i
strongly
endorse
this
flemish
sour
as
a
worthwhile
comparison
while
intensely
sour
the
beer
offers
a
more
restrained
complexity
than
that
of
rodenbach
but
also
exchanges
some
variations
when
compared
to

have
to

no
the

keep
me
from
drinking
this

am
glad
i

it

it
the

better

is
la

this

the

a

would

reviews
i
have
always
passed
this
beer
up
right
now
im
kinda
wondering
why
it
is
quite
the
treat
immediately
i
get
wooden
oak
flavors
like
literally
licking
a
piece
of
oak
wood
or
something
which
instantly
changes
to
tart
cherries
and
blackberries
just
a
slight
offputting
metallic
flavor
but
it
comes
and
goes
so
not
really
detrimental
to
the
overall
taste
i
could
see
why
people
say
this
beer
is
somewhat
watery
but
i
think
its
just
more
balanced
and
oak
forward
than
a
lot
of
sours
we
get
here
in
the
states
could
have
something
to
do
with
the
cognac
barrels
this
is
aged
in
as
i
do
get
some
alcohol
flavors
lingering
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
nicely
carbonated
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
not
as
sour
as
i
tend
to
like
my
sour
beers
but
the
oak
flavor
is
great
overall
i
was
built
up
on
the
appearance
and
smell
and
was
disappointed
by
the
tastemouthfeel
taste
is
a
bit
odd
sour
and
a
bit
vinegary
but
also
earthy
mouthfeel
is
big
and
very
carbonated
finish
is
sour
and
tart
overall
its
decent
but
not
too
special
o
this
beer
is
very
soft
on
the
palate
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
id
like
a
bit
more
sourness
to
come
thru
but
allinall
a
pretty
okay
beer
d
overall
tasty
and
fun
to
try
though
i
think
it
is
a
bit
young
and
oaky
i
think
looking
forward
to
revisiting
this
in
a
year
or
two
a
very
nice
red
sour
and
quite
the
surprise
my
first
beer
from
italy
is
a
hit
o
bellissima
birra
balanced
in
all
senses
refreshing
and
at
the
same
time
sour
and
tasty
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
flanders
red
ale
pricey
but
good
overall
this
was
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
but
not
all
that
impressive
maybe
a
more
current
vintage
would
change
things
a
bit
but
the
flavors
seem
quite
mellow
compared
to
my
expectations
after
reading
the
detailed
description
and
the
elevated
price
tag
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
outlay
of
20plus
dollars
wll
not
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
or
will
i
recommend
it
if
asked
o
not
bad
not
great
for
the
pricetag
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
unless
i
here
newer
vintages
are
significantly
better

i
can

wouldnt

for

makes
it

to
a

im
not
hugely
experienced
with
this
style
and
id
love
to
compare
it
it
was
certainly
an
interesting
taste
for
a
beer
lover
but
not
something
id
imagine
youd
want
to
have
as
a
session
i
corked
the
bottle
with
maybe
5oz
left
to
try
with
a
dessert
tonight
i
dont
know
how
it
will
hold
up
over
20ish
hours
with
the
top
off
but
im
willing
to
risk
it
to
pair
it
with
some
sweets
good
all
around
not
mindblowing
but
enjoyable
through
and
through
reminds
me
of
a
lambic
with
a
very
nice
fruit
bouquet
not
as
acetic
as
some
flanders
solid
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
at
18
bucks
a

its
a
bit
steep

a
fine

a
sour
ale

for

have

or
dissident
almost
for
this

d
for
a
sour
its
extremely
drinkable
it
has
a
lot
of
character
i
struggle
to
describe
but
its
also
pretty
simple
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
the
only
alcohol
presence
i
really
found
was
that
it
was
a
bit
hard
on
my
stomach
aside
from
that
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
detect
d
i
find
the
acidity
is
balanced
enough
with
the
tart
fruits
to
make
this
quite
drinkable
this
would
be
great
to
sip
and
enjoy
on
a
patio
in
the
spring
or
summer
glad
i
tried
this
o
a
great
version
of
the
flanders
red
style
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
ridiculous
price
tag
leave
it
to
the
italians
to
save
a
unique
traditional
distinctly
artisanal
and
nearextinct
gastronomic
treasure
somewhere
carlos
petrini
and
slow
food
is
proud
after
all
italians
didnt
earn
their
reputation
as
discerning
gourmands
and
sensual
hedonists
for
no
good
reason
this
is
a
masterful
ale
that
is
well
worth
whatever
the
asking
price
recommended
o
disappointing
sour
one
dimensional
funk
not
enough
soul
o
a
good
beer
a
style
that
i
am
new
to
and
am
developing
a
taste
for
this
one
was
good
for
someone
who
is
new
to
sours
like
me
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
im
typically
not
a
huge
fan
of
flanders
but
this
one
is
done
very
well
exceptionally
smooth
throughout
right
up
there
with
the
rodenbach
offerings
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
see
it
overall
a
great
sour
but
you
have
to
dig
the
style
to
appreciate
it
pricey
at
14
but
easy
drinking
i
polished
off
an
entire
bottle
and
i
could
easily
have
another
incredibly
drinkable
and
balanced
for
a
sour
could
easily
finish
a
750
i
did
the
abv
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
wish
this
hadnt
disappeared
in
the
lcbo
so
quickly
its
not
everyday
there
is
a
sour
available
at
your
local
lcbo
well
hotdamn
those
italians
made
something
that
i
actually
like
kidding
the
italians
make
lots
of
stuff
i
like
this
beer
is
tasty
approachable
sour
and
overall
just
delicious
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
anyone
who
says
they
dont
like
beer
but
claims
to
like
champagne
its
just
a
great
thing
really
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
drinkability
is
surprisingly
decent
im
not
a
lover
of
things
sour
but
this
has
some
appeal
not
sure
id
drink
them
back
to
back
mind
you
im
glad
the
lcbo
in
ontario
brought
in
a
real
sour
pours
a
murky
amberbrown
colour
with
huge
white
head
lots
of
lacing
covers
the
glass
great
head
retention
smells
of
oak
apple
with
some
fruity
vinegar
very
sour
flavour
i
wasnt
expecting
it
this
sour
for
some
reason
but
quite
nice
there
is
still
a
lot
of
sweetness
too
great
carbonation
level
on
this
i
plan
to
buy
a
few
more
bottles
before
this
runs
out
this
was
a
pretty
beautiful
beer
not
quite
as
sour
as
i
had
expected
but
certinally
as
dry
and
oaky
very
wine
like
there
was
a
little
bit
of
vinegar
like
flavor
but
the
gorgeous
eartiness
saved
it
indeed
throw
in
some
fruit
flavors
like
cherry
perhaps
a
little
plum
and
youve
got
it
this
was
great
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
it
is
not
astringent
or
excessively
barnyardy
it
has
a
nicely
balanced
fruitiness
and
sourness
with
some
woodaged
complexity
hides
the
alcohol
well
oh
by
the
way
this
is
an
09
expensive
but
i
say
worth
the
odd
purchase
every
now
and
again
drinkability
at
8
i
could
drink
this
entire
bottle
very
comfortably
easy
to
drink
tasty
sour
ale
i
would
like
to
try
a
more
fresh
example
as
this
was
a
2007
release
batch
8
bottle
1779
very
nice
had
it
again
vintage
2005
bottle
in
the
summer
of
2011
a
exceptional
flemish
red
intense
wet
saddle
leather
saltiness
tart
of
balsamic
vinegar
cherries
tobacco
and
tannins
that
ive
only
come
across
in
wine
excellent
as
i
would
assume
this
beer
pours
a
nice
garnet
red
color
with
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
the
smell
is
raspberries
strawberries
and
sour
oak
since
i
know
that
was
the
intent
of
this
beer
to
smell
like
that
i
will
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
though
i
must
say
candidly
it
really
was
not
my
favorite
the
sour
oak
flavor
comes
through
even
stronger
in
the
taste
the
fruit
characteristics
are
still
there
but
instead
this
is
a
bit
more
intense
and
souring
on
the
tongue
again
this
from
what
ive
been
told
is
by
design
aside
from
the
sourness
the
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
but
fairly
close
to
the
target
as
far
as
drinkability
its
pretty
easy
going
for
a
beer
but
due
to
my
opposition
to
the
taste
i
have
a
large
problem
rating
it
any
higher
than
i
am
i
wont
drink
it
again
im
sure
its
good
for
those
who
love
sours
2009
vintage
batch
11
bottle
268
from
my
beerofthemonth
club
it
pours
a
murky
amber
that
heads
toward
brown
in
the
center
all
topped
by
a
finger
of
offecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
funky
red
grapes
moss
kale
cardamom
and
lemon
wedge
the
taste
follows
this
path
along
with
some
oak
and
sour
blue
raspberry
which
all
then
tapers
into
some
sweet
blueberry
and
black
grape
in
the
end
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
decent
sour
brew
though
nothing
entirely
exciting
or
great
nice
to
experiment
with
though
drinkability
at
8
you
would
never
know
it
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
my
body
sure
did
very
drinkable
d
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
would
not
recommend
it
on
the
plus
side
the
8
abv
is
nearly
imperceptible
drinkability
i
split
the
bottle
with
two
other
people
though
they
werent
enormous
fans
of
this
beer
either
i
dont
know
that
id
pick
it
up
again
though
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
if
someone
else
was
cracking
it
open
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
if
you
like
a
sour
ale
its
huge
if
you
dont
like
a
sour
ale
try
this
one
youll
probably
like
it
im
not
sure
what
a
good
pairing
would
be
stinky
cheeses
perhaps
but
at
8
youd
better
pair
it
with
something
final
note
the
tobacco
notes
are
similar
but
much
more
muted
and
nuanced
than
the
flavors
i
found
from
haandbryggeriets
akevittaged
porter
a
very
distinct
flavor
if
you
enjoy
the
style
you
must
try
this
beer
i
dont
think
this
is
actually
the
only
unpasteurized
traditional
brewed
flanders
red
but
it
does
have
a
singular
subtlety
among
its
peers
i
have
a
habit
of
trying
the
top
beer
in
a
style
or
grouping
with
the
first
one
i
get
the
first
kriek
i
ever
drank
was
cantillon
and
everything
else
paled
in
comparison
i
may
have
done
it
again
with
italian
craft
beers
this
is
my
first
and
if
this
isnt
the
best
then
what
is
yet
to
come
should
be
magnifico
oh
how
i
wish
had
some
prosciutto
and
mozzarella
to
go
with
this
overall
aaah
ok
now
i
get
why
people
like
sours
this
was
my
first
real
sour
experience
and
im
loving
it
d
goes
down
easily
not
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
off
for
me
as
it
became
extremely
watery
in
the
finish
d
not
my
favorite
sour
but
pretty
drinkable
at
8
very
good
sour
impressed
i
love
the
style
and
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
certainly
spot
on
and
delicious
i
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
poured
into
a
fitting
glass
d
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
but
not
all
that
impressive
maybe
a
more
current
vintage
would
change
things
a
bit
i
had
this
from
a
750ml
bottle
2009
batch
11
bottle
876
the
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
light
tan
head
ok
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
a
little
sour
and
vinegar
same
with
the
taste
but
this
beer
is
severly
lacking
to
other
great
flanders
lightly
tart
but
not
enough
punch
or
vinegar
really
kind
of
boring
and
disappointing
maybe
a
good
flanders
red
for
the
beginner
notes
batch
8
2007
vintage
bottle
2680
d
a
definite
sipper
complex
with
some
distinct
red
wine
like
qualities
loaded
with
complexity
a
bottle
with
exploring
and
sharing
however
im
not
sure
its
a
must
try
especially
given
a
fairly
high
price
point
d
drinkability
is
decent
that
is
about
all
that
can
be
said
for
this
one
the
flavors
seem
to
work
well
together
even
without
any
suds
the
combination
of
oak
fruit
and
earthiness
is
done
pretty
well
a
750
ml
bottle
is
no
problem
in
one
setting
but
id
like
to
see
some
changes
made
before
trying
my
hand
at
this
one
again
panil
barriquee
is
a
rather
big
disappointment
for
me
i
was
excited
about
this
one
and
held
on
to
the
bottle
for
quite
a
while
maybe
it
diminished
in
that
period
of
time
the
biggest
problems
are
the
lack
of
flavor
the
medicinal
taste
and
the
lack
of
bubbles
fix
those
things
and
itd
be
all
the
better
for
it
cant
recommend
it
at
this
point
i
dont
recall
exactly
what
i
paid
for
this
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
too
much
ill
gladly
try
it
again
but
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
sours
list
drinkin
from
a
satan
glass
though
soaked
in
casks
formerly
used
for
cognac
and
wine
i
note
that
it
is
considered
kosher
because
there
is
no
real
wine
its
not
considered
the
actual
flavour
by
the
science
of
kashruth
i
had
previously
spoken
to
the
head
of
the
most
senior
inspector
in
canada
about
this
and
i
can
pass
on
details
if
anyone
is
inetrested
definitely
worth
the
purchase
d
this
is
a
superb
brew
especially
at
this
age
i
have
had
fresher
samples
two
years
old
and
they
are
not
quite
on
this
level
yet
d
im
always
thankful
to
try
a
beer
i
havent
had
but
now
i
know
i
dont
need
to
purchase
this
one
or
seek
it
out
pours
a
wonderful
deep
ruby
with
an
off
white
head
super
retention
and
some
tight
lacing
light
sour
aroma
oaky
fruity
mild
musty
basement
in
the
background
lovely
vinuous
quality
to
the
flavor
almost
dry
but
not
totaly
dry
tasty
berry
fruit
flavors
pleasantly
tart
but
not
sour
drinks
easier
than
some
other
of
the
style
great
beer
enjoyed
it
a
lot
but
dont
know
if
i
could
put
down
more
then
a
750ml
one
thing
is
for
sure
best
sour
red
i
have
had
d
noth
the
best
sour
red
ale
ive
had
but
very
good
surprised
italians
made
such
a
beer
great
stuff
in
an
evening
of
sampling
some
classic
sour
ales
this
one
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
fine
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
copper
amber
aroma
is
floral
berry
yeast
malt
flavor
is
similar
and
rich
body
is
full
and
round
body
is
outstanding
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
the
flavor
lots
of
character
yet
easy
drinking
pleasant
a
masterpiece
perhaps
a
session
for
sipping
so
there
were
a
lot
of
strong
opinions
about
this
beer
at
the
tasting
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
beer
is
kind
of
sweet
at
first
strong
funk
in
the
middle
palate
of
the
mouth
alcohol
flavor
and
it
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
woodsey
aftertaste
its
better
than
most
thought
but
its
not
my
favorite
i
would
drink
it
again
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
mind
blowing
sour
after
5
years
no
more
than
a
rodenbach
clssic
but
a
very
good
sour
d
a
bit
disappointed
i
had
hoped
for
a
nice
complex
brew
tart
crisp
dry
with
the
added
oak
notes
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
price
was
a
little
high
considering
the
product
17
perhaps
a
newer
vintage
would
be
more
to
my
liking
and
if
i
see
one
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
shot
until
then
though
im
not
too
convinced
d
the
smells
are
headed
in
the
right
general
ballpark
and
even
the
flavor
isnt
terrible
per
se
also
quite
drinkable
in
a
literal
sense
the
8
booze
is
well
hidden
but
still
a
big
disappointment
pretty
drinkable
probably
the
best
italian
beer
ive
had
not
that
that
is
saying
too
much
batch

2007
16
750ml
dark
red
like
a
flanders
should
be
smells
quite
good
at
first
funky
complex
yeasty
almost
like
lambic
or
gueuze
the
flavor
is
nice
sour
woody
pretty
nice
without
beating
you
over
the
head
with
sourness
or
vinegar
the
only
drawback
is
that
this
beer
is
way
too
thin
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
but
it
still
feels
a
little
watery
d
on
the
more
mild
side
of
the
style
darn
drinkable
d
easy
to
drink
due
to
mild
funk
and
no
carbonation
actually
i
missed
the
carbonation
it
does
have
some
booze
in
the
background
and
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
age
batch

riserva
2008
750ml
bottle
bottle
conditioned
served
in
the
second
gen
boulevard
chalice
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
little
head
there
was
very
little
carbonation
to
this
fruity
aroma
with
some
cherry
slightly
tart
cherry
flavor
some
sweetness
light
bodied
bit
of
oak
in
the
finish
also
a
little
sharpness
in
the
finish
flavor
improved
as
it
opened
up
a
bit
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
light
and
champaigny
refreshing
to
be
honest
i
cant
really
tell
that
its
oakaged
perhaps
oaky
vanilla
just
doesnt
adhere
itself
to
this
style
or
perhaps
i
would
notice
if
i
had
an
unoaked
batch
to
compare
solid
drinkability
no
idea
that
this
guy
is
8
abv
a
surprisingly
quaffable
sour
d
while
the
beer
smells
and
tastes
nice
the
thin
watery
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
and
really
negatively
affects
the
beer
still
a
pleasant
experience
overall
but
not
something
i
would
necessarily
choose
again
unless
i
knew
the
thinness
and
severe
lack
of
carbonation
was
a
fluke
of
this
particular
bottle
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
bubbly
light
tan
head
that
was
gone
quickly
falling
to
some
medium
sized
bubbles
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
buttery
oak
acidic
some
notes
of
cherries
apple
skins
light
citrus
some
mustiness
belgian
yeast
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
flavor
is
dry
and
tart
cherries
are
the
most
predominant
of
the
fruit
character
but
its
a
tart
cherry
flavor
and
yet
not
completely
sour
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
lie
deep
in
the
back
of
the
flavor
profile
but
its
there
only
momentarily
until
the
dry
tannic
tartness
washes
it
away
oak
is
not
as
noticeable
on
the
tonuge
as
it
is
in
the
nose
but
it
is
there
and
adds
a
nice
touch
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
on
the
mediumlight
side
and
the
warming
alcohol
is
noticeable
on
the
finish
not
as
refreshing
as
most
flemish
reds
ive
had
its
definitely
a
sipper
especially
at
8
abv
this
is
pairing
nicely
with
the
beef
stew
im
enjoying
at
the
moment
as
the
acidity
is
cutting
nicely
across
the
savory
beef
herbs
and
spices
the
only
problem
is
that
its
a
little
expensive
overall
this
beer
would
be
better
carbonated
i
dont
know
what
went
wrong
other
than
that
it
is
pretty
good
though
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
minus
the
price
tag
all
in
all
a
decent
sour
beer
but
comes
up
lacking
in
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
all
the
right
things
are
there
but
just
not
quite
strong
enough
fair
amount
of
good
flavors
but
there
are
better
examples
entirely
too
expensive
for
what
you
get
in
the
bottle
d
i
enjoyed
it
but
am
glad
i
shared
the
bottle
a
750
of
this
would
be
a
bit
much
for
me
a
good
beer
that
i
always
enjoy
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
all
the
time
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
at
time
and
the
flavor
dropped
off
quicker
then
i
anticipated
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
d
good
presentation
of
balance
if
that
can
be
said
of
flanders
red
an
interesting
beer
none
the
less
light
almost
watery
but
overall
surprisingly
smooth
punctuated
by
acidic
and
tannic
notes
plus
spritzy
yet
mild
carbonation
giving
texture
and
flavor
lift
pours
out
red
almost
brown
with
a
dense
yellowoffwhite
head
leaving
n
ice
lacing
and
having
some
decent
retention
im
really
impressed
looks
much
better
than
id
expect
the
smell
is
a
very
deep
and
light
funk
not
very
strong
and
just
a
bit
less
than
i
expected
this
one
comes
out
with
a
bit
off
sourness
quite
a
lot
of
tartness
and
a
pleasant
sweetness
this
one
reminds
me
a
bit
more
of
beer
than
the
average
flanders
red
has
notes
of
raisin
chocolate
caramel
and
a
tiny
bit
of
breadiness
the
sourness
comes
off
first
like
sour
candy
then
comes
in
with
lime
juice
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
woody
sweetness
i
like
it
ive
had
a
few
which
are
more
impressive
and
i
may
be
a
sour
hound
loving
every
one
i
taste
but
i
think
its
got
everything
it
takes
but
not
the
wow
factor
the
carbonation
is
just
perfect
pleasant
great
the
body
is
quite
full
moreso
than
i
expected
and
it
almost
feels
warm
at
50ish
degrees
very
nice
id
say
this
one
goes
down
very
pleasantly
not
too
bold
but
has
a
high
enough
abv
to
get
at
you
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
especially
if
you
can
afford
it
pours
out
a
pretty
dark
color
for
the
style
it
is
brown
with
ruby
hints
coming
through
the
edges
there
is
no
head
at
all
but
that
could
be
due
to
the
gentle
pour
the
aroma
is
of
oak
cherries
and
alcohol
a
definitely
tart
qualities
shocks
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
very
sour
with
notes
of
oak
and
maybe
some
sugar
glad
i
wad
able
to
try
it
love
that
italians
are
starting
to
make
some
awesome
beers
d
not
a
bad
sipping
drink
i
enjoyed
it
for
sure
d
im
not
going
to
entirely
rule
out
drinking
this
beer
again
but
id
only
consider
a
fresh

i
rather
love
this
interpretation
masterfully

silky

lightly
carbonated
just
the

of

a
true
delight
a
lot
of
oak
in
the
nose
which
is
on
the
slightly
faint
side
but
the
taste
comes
out
nicely
balanced
with
all
the
proper

there
are
crisp

that

with

that
add

not

2006
vintage
perhaps
my
first
italian
beer
this
poured
a
muddy
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
a
blend
of
cabernet
grapes
oak
apple
cider
and
mulled
spices
and
some
citrus
hops
it
tasted
like
leathery
and
oaky
malt
tart
grapewine
hops
and
spicy
apple
cider
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
tart
aftertaste
overall
this
was
half
beer
half
wine
and
all
delicious
it
had
a
great
unique
flavor
that
was
intricate
clean
and
drinkable
the
only
thing
that
could
be
improved
is
the
bottle
it
does
not
do
the
beer
justice
overall
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
truly
a
standout
in
the
style
id
like
to
try
a
younger
bottle
and
compare
not
as
sour
as
rgc
but
still
very
tasty
and
very
very
complex
great
cheese
beer
if
you
like
the
style
and
dont
mind
the
price

this
is

must

review
transferred
from
the
other

for
this
beer
as
the
bottle
i
consumed
looks
like
this
bottle
and
not
the
bottle
pictured
in
the
other
listing
it
nails
the
style
and
tastes
great
the
fact
that
its
from
italy
makes
it
even
more
the
appealing
brew
a
real
treat
d
cant
really
notice
any
alcoholic
presence
so
its
obviously
masked
really
well
from
the
sour
fruitiness
and
probably
partly
due
to
smoothing
out
from
the
aging
for
a
sour
this
is
pretty
drinkable
cost
is
the
only
thing
preventing
you
from
going

dosnt
taste
like
it
looks
kind

approaches
a

but
not
quite
would
recommend
this
to
sour
beer
drinkers
and
the
best
italian
brew
ive
ever
had
bottled
in
2006
and
by
this
time
it
is
quite
flat
but
also
still
quite
sour
pours
perfectly
still
with
no
head
at
all
and
a
cherry
red
in
color
tinged
with
brown
softly
acetic
and
richly
fruity
with
sour
cherry
and
plum
and
even
a
bit
of
mango
and
a
touch
of
spice
at
the
end
more
than
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
this
tastes
more
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
gently
sour
and
with
full
on
cherry
and
earth
ponot
noir
flavors
with
some
lemon
and
spicebox
notes
highly
unusual
to
say
the
least
there
are
also
some
gentle
tannins
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
tart
and
smooth
im
totally
sure
i
like
this
but
it
is
interesting
reading
the
other
reviews
most
seem
to
have
carbonated
versions
and
i
think
id
probably
like
that
better
d
i
like
this
a
lot
and
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
07
bottle
pours
a
ruby
color
with
mild
offwhite
head
smell
is
oaky
and
sour
cherry
taste
is
mainly
the
same
two
flavors
as
in
the
nose
with
no
real
offensive
funkiness
at
all
still
tart
and
some
vinegar
qualities
but
one
of
the
more
drinkable
sours
that
ive
had
for
sure
nice
as
far
as
sours
go
overall
i
thought
but
still
not
my
cup
of
tea
id
drink
it
again
but
in
terms
of
bang
for
the
buck
either
of
the
rodenbachs
is
a
better
deal
but
this
is
a
fair
sub
if
you
cant
find
them
flemish
red
ales
are
my
true
favorite
style
but
panil
is
not
my
favorite
flemish
red
it
is
growing
on
me
as
it
settles
but
i
much
prefer
duchesse
rodenbach
and
monks
over
this
it
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
with
plenty
of
haze
head
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
typical
of
the
style
albeit
with
a
less
pronounced
vinous
aroma
the
taste
is
where
things
wildly
diverge
this
ale
is
a
bit
too
vinegary
not
nearly
mouth
puckering
sourish
enough
not
nearly
as
candied
cherry
tart
flavored
and
a
bit
too
watery
and
carbonated
im
obviously
very
particular
in
what
i
prefer
in
the
style
and
this
beer
doesnt
measure
up
nearly
enough
as
i
would
have
liked
it
is
also
quite
expensive
im
warming
up
to
it
though
and
im
not
panning
the
beer
by
any
measure
i
just
feel
that
if
you
want
the
real
deal
go
to
the
belgian
font
and
experience
true
heaven
in
a
bottle
rather
than
an
italian
imitation
as
the
beer
settles
in
there
is
less
vinegar
more
complex
flavors
emerging
but
it
is
lacking
the
explosion
on
the
palate
that
youll
find
in
other
beers
of
the
style
tart
brown
sugar
fruitiness
mild
horseblanket
some
cherry
apple
grape
maybe
more
tart
than
funk
but
much
more
funky
than
something
like
duchesse
notes

though
it
isnt

really
definitely
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
but
not
the
absolute
greatest
this
might
be
a
good
introductory
beer
for
newcomers
to
the
style
d
this
is
not
my
style
so
i
found
it
hard
to
enjoy
and
doubt
i
will
indulge
again
it
was
too
reminicent
of
dry
white
wine
for
my
taste
drinkability
despite
is
thin
nature
its
got
a
good
light
sour
taste
and
is
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
hits
towards
the
finish
drinkability
was
good
but
not
great
i
have
had
better
sour
beers
but
this
one
was
good
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
but
wont
be
rushing
out
for
more
as
after
tax
it
was
around
20
this
is
truly
a
special
ale
bottled
in
2005
barrique
poured
a
deep
cloudy
and
unfiltered
red
brown
like
dark
raspberries
into
a
small
wine
glass
after
a
vigorous
pour
a
half
inch
of
smooth
head
formed
and
some
gorgeous
lacing
remained
as
the
glass
emptied
a
wonderful
presentation
all
in
all
sour
grape
and
winelike
aromas
predominated
with
an
accent
of
sweet
malt
after
the
initial
sour
shock
on
the
taste
buds
this
panil
turned
out
to
be
quite
well
balanced
with
enough
malt
presence
and
even
some
tasty
hop
bitterness
in
the
far
background
very
subtle
taste
a
connoisseurs
beer
a
distinctly
red
winelike
mouth
feel
and
flavor
predominates
i
found
it
to
be
extremely
drinkable
and
i
highly
recommend
it
as
a
choice
for
pairing
with
food
it
was
absolutely
perfect
with
the
porterhouse
steak
i
just
ate
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
recent
months
06
vintage
i
was
so
loking
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
however
i
was
underimpressed
i
was
ready
for
a
big
sour
aroma
it
didnt
happen
not
much
sour
and
not
much
oak
virtually
zero
head
really
kind
of
a
bland
beer
i
dont
think
i
even
finished
the
bottle
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
didnt
get
a
representative
bottle
i
bought
this
at
greens
on
buford
this
past
spring
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
as
i
love
this
style
of
beer
d
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
fantastic
but
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
match
it
is
extremely
refreshing
with
what
i
would
consider
a
high
level
of
acidity
even
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
little
too
acetic
for
my
taste
the
oak
character
is
also
too
assertive
or
at
least
too
coarse
and
woody
for
me
on
the
plus
side
it
has
a
great
complex
earthiness
especially
in
the
nose
and
the
roasted
notes
in
the
finish
are
an
unusual
and
interesting
touch
overall
it
is
quite
a
good
beer
but
at
nearly
twice
the
price
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
it
should
be
even
better
drinkability
is
good
as
far
as
the
beer
itself
is
concerned
but
not
so
good
with
respect
to
the
price
this
is
pretty
expensive
stuff
so
its
for
sipping
or
special
occasions
only
cheers
drinkable
but
this
will
be
my
last
barriquee
unless
i
can
find
the
other
version
because
of
its
thin
body
and
light
sourness
this
is
actually
significantly
more
drinkable
than
most
flanders
reds
ive
tried
previously
all
in
all
quite
nice
and
something
id
be
willing
to
share
with
a
friend
but
probably
not
something
i
will
seek
out
for

like
stilton
cheese
oak
some
pie
cherry
really
not
taking
much
on
the
nose
here
personally
as
it
warms
it
kinda
reminds
me
of
cherry
jolly
rancher
smell
flavor
is
lightly
tart
with
rich
acetic
character
lightly
sweet
and
a
good
bit
of
oak
thin
with
light
ticklish
carb
and
a
dry
finish
overall
the
beer
is
really
drinkable
as
it
warms
it
is
really
inviting
as
a
beverage
makes
me
wish
i
were
sitting
in
a
lush
leather
chair
at
fireside
overall
one
of
the
better
flanders
ive
had
sadly
the
more
i
have
this
style
the
more
i
realize
i
dont
particularly
like
it
with
the
beer
having
heavier
funk
and
oak
and
it
being
less
sweet
than
other
flanders
it
makes
this
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
mouthfeel
sticky
decent
carbonation
after
all
interesting

pours
a
clear

with
a
collared

not
too
much
different
than
the
regular

but
just
a
little
cleaner
cherry
light
sour
and
some
mild
oak
littler
sour
fruit
notes
some
alcohol
notes
come
through
on
this
one
overall
more
mellow
than
the
regular
version
not
too
bad
d
enjoyable
in
slow
sips
before
a
meal
or
with
a
nice
cheese
develops
some
unique
flavor
characteristics
as
it
warms
up
a
must
try
for
those
sour
beer
lovers
o
quality

brew
nice
take
on

with
this
one
one
the
smokey
dry
sour
side
o
i
like
this
beer
as
an
easy
drinker
with
some
unique
flavors
would
do
it
again
other
than
it
is
quite
pricey
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
small
whitish
head
that
receded
to
a
wispy
layer
aroma
of
sour
cherries
red
wine
and
brandy
with
some
grassy
notes
tart
taste
of
cherries
and
grapes
up
front
with
a
sense
of
spices
present
malty
base
with
caramel
noticeable
and
a
very
woody
quality
almost
earthy
with
a
touch
of
barnyard
funk
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
strong
and
a
nice
drink
nice
oak
presence
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
this
is
the
most
balanced
sour
i
have
ever
had
the
finish
leaves
no
sour
behind
while
the
front
assaults
the
sour
taste
buds
very
impressive
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
8
sour
the
glass
went
down
with
ease
but
i
think
that
like
23
is
a
little
much
for
this
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
the
abv
is
hidden
the
sour
flavors
are
very
refined
and
pleasant
with
nothing
coming
close
to
overwhelming
or
even
dominant
this
is
easily
the
best
flanders
red
that
i
have
ever
had
the
price
tag
is
close
to
20
but
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
are
worth
it
i
mentioned
fruit
numerous
times
in
the
review
and
i
do
not
believe
that
fruit
was
actually
added
flat
out
amazing
beer
even
though
its
a
little
expensive
its
well
worth
it
i
will
pick
this
beer
up
every
time
i
see
it
from
now
on
great
sour
riserva
version
aged
15
months
in
bordeaux
casks
instead
of
3
or
something
pours
a
fairly
clear
deep
brownish
read
with
a
nice
soapy
beige
head
nose
is
lovely
cherries
brett
wet
wood
just
a
rich
lovely
nose
much
softer
and
more
delicate
in
the
mouth
than
its
younger
counterpart
very
well
integrated
mouth
of
brett
wood
and
wine
with
a
dose
of
mildly
sour
cherries
and
a
tiny
bit
of
aged
balsamic
soft
carbonation
lush
mouthfeel
way
better
than
the
regular
panil
primarily
through
the
lack
of
acetone
d
great
sour
fruity
flavor
throughout
with
a
full
oak
finish
aroma
is
very
inviting
but
a
little
more
vinegar
than
wanted
nice
smooth
and
clean
mouthfeel
easy
drinker
i
wasnt
a
huge
panil
fan
the
first
time
this
dindt
really
improved
anything
to
me
if
anything
brings
out
more
cognac
than
id
care
for
density
and
fullness
of
flavor
make
it
slightly
less
refreshing
than
many
other
sours
but
for
the
flanders
style
this
one
is
a
stand
out
as
excellent
easy
to
drink
but
mildly
filling
excellent
in
funk
and
depth
of
character
d
this
was
pretty
terrific
stuff
if
you
like
rodenbach
at
all
then
youll
dig
this
one
very
drinkable
as
my
wife
and
i
killed
a
750ml
bottle
with
no
troubles
wish
it
werent
so
dang
expensive
serving
type
bottle
lacked
the
character
i
imagined
a
flanders
style
beer
would
have
will
age
it
longer
next
time
meow
beer
you
can
feel
the
wild

great
tasting
beer
but
for
the
price
i
wont
be
buying
another
one

not

certainly
one
of
the
more

overall
a

style
beer
more
sweet
than
sour
but
lots
of
cherries
which
i
love
worth
checking
out
but
not
really
a
big
sour
overall
ive
been
impressed
with
almost
every
logsdon
beer
ive
tried
and
this
one
is
no
exception
one
of
the
most
refreshing
higher
abv
beers
ive
had
as
well
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
it
id
also
be
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
as
well
overall
a
pleasant
beer
by
logsdon
complexity
is
not
tremendous
but
the
flavors
that
are
there
flow
nicely
drinks
lighter
than
a
flanders
red
and
not
as
sour
as
lambic
krieks
i
like
the
subdued
characters
as
the
drinkability
increases
makes
for
a
nice
summer
drinker
o
it
has
good
flavors
but
it
could
be
a
little
louder
good
balance
though
and
the
sour
doesnt
dominate
at
all
this
is
very
good
very
light
and
has
the
effervescence
of
champagne
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
an
easy
drinking
kriek
but
overall
middle
of
the
road
by
all
regards
it
is
very
mild
and
approachable
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
o
this
is
good
but
ive
had
much
better
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
anyways
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
who
like
the
style
but
i
would
not
have
another
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
i
dont
feel
like
it
is
living
up
to
all
it
could
be
this
isnt
a
particularly
subtle
style
so
this
beer
oughtnt
be
holding
back
yet
it
seems
to
be
its
quality
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
its
doing
enough
o
not
a
bad
flanders
well
worth
a
try
light
body
and
highly
carbonated
lightly
prickly
on
the
tongue
a
little
disappointed
with
the
taste
of
this
one
drinkability
is
ok
its
pretty
light
but
there
is
a
burn
from
the
alcohol
what
stands
out
fairly
glaringly
against
very
little
else
for
the
cost
and
patience
to
cellar
i
thought
this
would
be
choice
on
the
first
really
hot
day
of
the
summer
while
i
suppose
its
quenching
it
a
bit
too
subtle
and
hot
o
somewhat
disappointing
very
mild
cherry
and
brett
with
oak
dominating
the
taste
profile
overall
really
nice
offering
from
logsdon
definitely
a
unique
kriekflanders
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
stuff
a
overall
impression
awesome
kriek
im
interested
in
trying
more
american
sours
and
this
one
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
im
hoping
to
find
another
bottle
of
this
or
their
peche
and
see
how
they
age
recommend
if
available
this
is
a
graham
color
with
some
cherry
hues
theres
a
solid
sheet
of
light
tan
foam
smells
like
cherries
oak
some
grain
funk
and
metal
tart
sharp
cherry
oak
water
bits
of
soil
and
musk
come
into
the
flavor
its
a
little
watery
and
carries
some
one
dimensional
tartness
that
seems
simple
without
the
complexity
id
expect
from
a
soured
beer
thin
with
light
carb
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
interesting
hopefully
there
is
a
solera
style
coming
out
of
the
barrels
allowing
for
further
growth
and
complexity
in
subsequent
batches
o
this
was
a
nice
kriek
that
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
however
i
probably
would
say
its
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
next
to
peche
n
brett
and
seizoen
bretta
i
thought
it
was
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
subtle
funk
to
it
it
was
a
little
bit
too
spritzy
and
the
flavors
could
have
been
brought
out
a
little
bit
more
id
definitely
recommend
at
least
checking
out
this
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
thats
kind
of
a
combination
saisonkriekflanders
red
with
brett
whats
not
to
like
ill
hang
on
to
one
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
o
great
effort
for
the
style
and
a
decent
drink
too
mild
all
around
everything
seems
muted
served
in
a
tulip
thanks
aaron
a
bit
of
cherry
flavor
is
mild
cherry
and
light
acidity
but
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
the
rest
of
logsdons
beers
it
seems
like
this
was
on
the
right
track
just
not
quite
all
the
way
there
hopefully
this
gets
made
again
as
id
love
to
see
the
progression
in
batches
of
this
one
beer
is
grainy
bready
with
a
decent
finish
but
nothing
too
fruity
happening
there
is
a
mild
cherry
fruitiness
to
the
finish
but
overall
this
is
just
a
saison
mild
peppery
notes
on
the
palate
as
well
hard
to
detect
too
much
else
i
dont
think
id
have
this
again
unless
it
were
on
draft
another
excellent
beer
from
logsdon
pours
very
hazy
and
a
somewhat
reddish
brown
in
it
small
dissipating
head
the
aroma
has
lots
of
cherry
flavor
and
funk
some
lemons
and
a
a
bit
of
caramel
oak
the
taste
is
sourer
than
expected
good
tartness
theres
some
caramel
malt
and
cherry
sweetness
but
its
far
from
cloying
some
oak
tannin
in
the
finish
very
nice
beer
feel
is
full
with
some
pucker
in
the
finish
ive
heard
a
few
people
compare
it
to
the
ng
fruit
beers
i
think
its
sourer
and
lacks
the
belgian
fruitiness
at
any
rate
im
getting
to
be
a
huge
fan
of
logsdon
overall
not
sour
not
terribly
interesting
either
cherry
and
not
much
else
d
very
drinkable
nice
funky
and
sour
kriekstyle
with
some
nice
cherry
flavor
and
some
great
funky
yeast
character
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
sour
cherry
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
sourness
and
a
slightly
acidic
finish
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
some
nice
flavors
very
interesting
beer
as
the
brett
and
cherry
fight
for
control
i
would
have
preferred
a
touch
less
brett
since
it
got
a
bit
overpowering
as
it
warmed
but
a
unique
experience
nonetheless
this
isnt
a
good
example
of
a
kriek
or
a
flanders
red
but
it
is
still
a
tasty
cherry
beer
this
may
not
live
up
to
expectations
but
taken
completely
on
its
own
its
still
a
very
tasty
beer
o
lighter
body
and
milder
flavors
than
i
was
expecting
a
very
nice
summer
sipper
o
tried
this
after
peche
n
brett
and
it
was
a
big
let
down
im
hopeful
this
develops
some
after
a
year
so
well
see
lacks
complexity
o
easily
drinkable
but
could
really
use
a
little
more
body
im
very
interested
to
see
how
logsdon
tweaks
this
beer
in
future
vintages
as
well
as
how
these
bottles
evolve
over
time
other
comments
this
is
highly
carbonated
when
i
uncapped
it
it
immediately
erupted
and
i
lost
a
few
ounces
to
the
kitchen
counter
this
has
happened
with
a
bottle
of
seizoen
bretta
too
i
know
they
prime
their
beers
with
pear
juice
so
maybe
thats
giving
some
erratic
results
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
the
taste
fell
a
little
short
on
this
its
good
but
not
one
of
the
top
flanders
reds
in
my
opinion
i
feel
like
lost
in
this
beer
somewhere
is
a
really
interesting
character
that
would
have
added
so
many
dimensions
to
this
flat
flavourless
affair
but
theres
just
nothing
here
at
least
any
more
o
delicious
nose
but
i
thought
the
taste
fell
short
not
bad
overall
but
definitely
underwhelming
overall
logsdon
should
have
a
far
better
flemish
red
than
this
one
this
is
thin
weak
and
lacking
complexity
and
verve
it
has
some
of
the
basic
characters
but
just
fumbles
with
them
until
it
produces
something
really
quite
pedestrian
cmon
guys
you
can
do
way
better
surely
overall
an
alright
beer
but
there
are
at
least
half
a
dozen
in
the
style
that
id
sooner
reach
for
i
like
logsdon
overall
but
this
one
just
isnt
quite
doing
it
for
me
that
said
this
might
be
a
nice
entrystyle
beer
for
those
who
are
looking
to
get
into
beers
in
the
sour
end
of
the
taste
spectrum
but
would
like
to
take
it
on
gradually
overall
a
tasty
and
quite
quaffable
flanders
red
sour
but
not
too
sour
with
an
interesting
complexity
that
while
not
mindblowing
can
keep
my
interest
through
the
bottle
good
stuff
another
nice
beer
from
logsdons
surprise
as
far
as
the
style
goes
this
is
not
particularly
tart
or
funky
its
good
but
i
think
it
could
be
more
magical
given
the
yeast
wizardry
that
this
brewery
usually
demonstrates
nice
not
the
most
complex
take
on
the
style
but
its
a
good
beer
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
m
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
for
sure
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
but
considering
the
brewery
which
im
a
big
fan
of
its
a
slight
disappointment
id
recommend
trying
it
if
you
can
but
no
need
to
go
to
great
lengths
to
seek
it
out
o
its
a
good
beer
but
for
the
price
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
out
of
it
dark
reddish
pour
with
thin
off
white
head
aroma
brought
notes
of
cherry
slight
oak
lemon
notes
hints
of
nice
red
fruits
touch
of
earthy
and
lots
of
spicy
notes
come
through
taste
is
a
mix
of
oak
earth
lemon
slight
red
fruits
touch
of
vinegar
lots
of
spice
in
there
finishing
fairly
oaky
slightly
tart
decent
o
an
excellently
crafted
beer
the
sourness
is
more
soft
than
its
inspiration
flemish
red
from
say
rodenbach
no
flavor
was
overwhelming
the
sour
character
and
the
malt
bill
balanced
each
other
almost
perfectly
this
beer
is
crafted
and
bottled
in
a
very
traditional
way
and
it
is
evident
in
the
product
i
also
appreciate
the
american
farmhouse
ruggedness
it
has
over
the
more
belgian
sophistication
of
a
traditional
topnotch
flemish
red
from
europe
id
say
its
the
best
american
attempt
at
a
flemish
red
ive
ever
had
id
drink
this
again
if
i
could
get
it
but
it
could
be
a
tough
sell
with
cheap
bottles
of
rodenbach
on
the
same
shelf
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
great
beer
would
be
curious
to
try
this
with
age
on
it
maybe
it
will
seem
much
more
like
a
flanders
red
as
it
picks
up
oxidized
and
vinegary
notes
with
age
but
im
loving
it
fresh
t
not
as
good
as
the
nose
but
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
a
light
cranberry
tartness
opens
things
up
with
some
light
red
cherry
underripe
red
apple
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
some
good
sourness
kicks
in
near
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
cherry
skin
tannins
coming
in
some
soft
bready
malt
caramel
and
vanilla
lurk
way
in
the
background
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
and
the
beer
is
a
bit
watery
but
its
a
really
pleasant
and
refreshing
tart
beer
d
fun
to
try
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
o
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
enjoyed
mehhh
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
get
all
that
excited
about
either
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
solid
flanders
style
red
much
better
than
cerasus
not
the
most
complex
in
the
subtle
style
to
which
logsdon
leans
but
satisfying
3
910
o
a
solid
beer
and
worth
trying
needs
additional
complexity
to
shine
but
i
will
say
it
was
better
than
its
older
brother
cerasus
which
actually
has
the
cherries
in
it
o
extremely
drinkable
id
gladly
drink
it
again
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
its
kinda
lackluster
when
placed
next
to
seizoen
bretta
and
peches
both
of
which
are
fantastic
overall
surprisingly
good
i
havent
been
impressed
by
logsdons
sour
offerings
but
this
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
o
it
was
decent
but
having
seen
the
price
for
this
one
in
bottle
i
would
pass
overall
a
really
enjoyable
sour
beer
from
a
great
little
brewery
o
definitely
have
been
digging
these
logsdon
beers
have
to
seek
out
more
of
their
offerings
especially
for
them
being
organic
in
all
overall
meh
wish
i
hadnt
shelled
out
the
cash
for
two
of
these
pours
a
murky
reddish
brown
color
gets
more
and
more
murky
with
each
pour
from
the
bottle
lots
of
bottle
conditioning
going
on
here
large
offwhite
head
scent
is
not
too
inviting
although
this
one
is
supposed
to
be
the
most
sour
from
the
bunch
it
is
not
the
most
funky
nor
does
it
hold
the
most
tart
aroma
from
the
logsdon
beers
scent
is
more
spicy
and
slightly
tart
unfortunately
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
notsogreat
breweries
that
make
an
attempt
at
wild
ales
the
taste
is
a
step
up
though
the
flavor
is
much
more
complex
and
overall
better
than
the
nose
taste
starts
off
immediately
tart
with
cherries
and
a
great
amount
of
oak
cherry
flavors
are
more
sweet
than
tart
still
tart
but
not
sour
wish
this
beer
was
more
sour
drinks
a
little
boozy
as
well
for
a
6
5
beer
ive
had
cascade
bruery
and
rr
sours
that
have
higher
abv
that
have
less
booziness
same
goes
for
any
saison
ive
had
from
fantome
finish
is
very
saisonlike
and
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
drinkability
is
okay
mouthfeel
is
slightly
acidic
but
hardly
very
carbonated
with
a
light
body
overall
i
was
hoping
for
something
better
when
i
read
the
label
and
heard
about
the
bugs
being
used
with
the
cherries
i
had
high
hopes
this
beer
is
a
solid
beer
just
not
worth
the
price
tag
i
would
much
rather
spend
20
on
a
wild
ale
from
cascade
or
bruery
pours
a
brownish
red
very
cloudy
sort
of
a
muddy
look
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
a
very
thick
layer
of
foam
to
start
anyway
lots
of
funky
cherries
in
the
aroma
tends
more
toward
fruit
sweetness
than
cerasus
the
funk
is
a
bit
odd
sort
of
cheesy
mild
medicinal
note
some
tannic
woodiness
the
taste
is
a
nice
tart
cherry
flavor
but
its
a
bit
washed
out
and
doesnt
quite
pack
the
punch
that
i
was
hoping
to
find
its
not
super
sour
though
i
wouldnt
call
it
sweet
the
finish
has
more
of
that
tannic
oak
flavor
mouthfeel
is
nice
though
id
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
creamier
and
less
fizzy
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
logsdon
beer
but
my
expectations
have
grown
so
much
with
each
beer
that
its
probably
not
a
terribly
fair
scale
still
i
probably
wont
be
picking
up
any
more
bottles
of
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
id
be
happy
to
get
a
glass
at
a
bar
overall
a
good
sour
but
by
no
means
amazing
none
of
the
flavors
really
shone
and
it
ended
up
being
less
complex
than
i
wouldve
wanted
d
very
drinkable
nice
flanders
red
ale
good
barrel
character
and
nice
yeast
flavors
come
through
o
hard
to
place
smooth
woody
fruit
and
silky
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
some
malt
fruit
and
vinegar
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
finish
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
overall
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
like
all
the
logsdon
beers
ive
had
thus
far
o
decent
strange
aftertaste
check
it
out
and
share
with
someone
not
familiar
with
the
style
this
tastes
like
it
could
have
used
some
more
time
souring
its
interesting
and
not
a
bad
flanders
red
but
its
not
particularly
exceptional
in
any
way
might
be
worth
a
try
might
improve
over
time
its
citric
and
decent
up
front
but
has
no
depth
or
complexity
thats
about
it
for
a
random
shelf
grab
american
made
flanders
red
this
is
pretty
nice
imo
a
good
level
of
fruit
flavors
and
that
nice
acetic
tartness
characteristic
of
the
style
overall
solid
effort
from
grey
sail
and
i
look
forward
to
possibly
more
sours
to
come
from
them
this
was
a
surprise
to
see
on
shelves
for
being
open
for
a
little
over
a
year
grey
sail
has
put
out
quite
a
few
good
beers
in
a
variety
of
styles
theyre
a
class
act
and
im
happy
to
find
another
reason
to
support
them
this
is
not
an
overwhelmingly
sour
beer
but
its
got
a
unique
flavor
with
a
lot
of
brown
ale
characteristics
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
wanted
this
beer
to
be
good
and
it
looked
fine
but
that
is
where
it
ended
as
a
big
fan
of
sours
i
was
excited
to
see
this
local
offering
unfortunately
it
smelled
like
an
unwashed
mash
tun
after
a
few
days
i
tried
to
drink
it
but
the
taste
was
like
licking
the
walls
of
said
mash
tun
an
unfortunate
drainpour
rjt
an
aroma
reminiscent
of
childrens
cough
syrup
and
a
flavor
dominated
by
strawberries
a
nice
fruity
beer
with
a
hint
of
sour
but
not
enough
to
call
it
a
sour
red
fruits
lead
the
taste
profile
i
got
raspberry
and
strawberry
with
slightly
sour
cherry
on
the
finish
as
others
have
said
not
very
sour
a
nice
drinking
red
with
lots
of
cherry
and
some
complexity
a
fairly
sweet
taste
with
slightly
sour
finish
i
liked
it
but
did
not
love
it
very
easy
drinking
sour
good
tasting
but
not
exactly
representative
of
the
style
but
good
none
the
less
medium
brown
in
color
not
really
any
head
mild
sour
aroma
a
bit
earthy
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
fairly
malty
with
just
a
slightly
sour
vinegary
finish
not
very
sour
drinks
easy
and
refreshing
thin
bodied
o
interesting
and
worth
trying
tried
this
as
part
of
a
belgian
beer
sample
shipmentgreat
gift
from
the
inlaws
and
have
had
some
great
sours
and
like
that
style
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
interesting
with
a
faintly
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
the
aroma
is
less
intense
than
expected
with
some
cherry
and
fig
present
the
taste
has
similar
notes
with
tart
cherry
and
cola
tea
and
golden
raisin
present
and
typical
sour
fruits
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
averagethin
overall
a
decent
offering
and
i
enjoyed
it
not
rodenbach
but
every
style
has
its
sublime
examples
taste
is
fruity
cola
tangy
fruit
and
red
grape
skins
similar
to
the
aroma
the
sour
level
is
disappointing
its
not
bad
it
has
some
decent
maltyfruit
interplay
but
really
falls
in
line
as
just
an
average
flanders
this
one
is
refreshing
and
similar
to
fruit
juice
i
enjoyed
it
late
on
a
warm
sunny
day
and
could
see
this
easily
being
a
digestive
it
is
off
style
but
certainly
would
make
a
fine
introduction
for
those
uninitiated
to
sour
beers
more
caramel
in
the
taste
but
it
comes
as
a
sweeter
note
something
in
the
way
of
sodalike
in
character
easy
to
drink
throughout
but
not
something
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
the
tartness
is
there
but
fails
to
surpass
the
sweetness
o
good
drinkability
refreshing
beer
o
little
aroma
and
little
flavor
and
the
flavor
available
is
mostly
sweet
this
beer
is
not
worth
a
try
oi
could
not
get
the
flavor
cherry
cola
out
of
my
head
when
drinking
this
brew
it
is
sweet
somewhat
simple
and
the
malted
dark
cherry
flavor
pretty
much
dominates
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
all
that
being
said
i
have
had
worse
o
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
strange
somewhat
artificial
seeming
beer
its
drinkable
enough
but
not
very
complex
and
the
sweetness
is
way
too
high
for
my
tastes
second
beer
in
the
sour
tower
takeover
tasting
too
much
attenuation
and
not
enough
tartness
for
the
style
leaves
this
one
sweet
and
a
bit
juicy
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
light
okay
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
this
beer
it
does
not
seem
like
a
flanders
beer
that
is
acidic
or
strong
in
flavor
to
me
is
lacks
a
lot
to
make
this
beer
excellent
it
is
just
an
average
beer
nothing
special
o
clearly
im
not
a
huge
fan
it
isnt
bad
overall
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
the
after
taste
is
where
it
really
lost
me
almost
reminds
me
of
a
root
beer
overall
this
is
a
goodtasting
beer
with
some
nice
complexity
but
there
are
other
beers
in
this
style
with
a
bit
more
intensity
and
far
more
lasting
flavor
overall
certainly
worth
a
shot
by
anyone
who
enjoys
sours
im
more
favorable
toward
sours
leading
to
a
higher
than
average
score
nice
that
it
is
year
round
as
well
as
mentioned
several
times
this
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
be
loving
it
but
id
have
another
one
any
day
not
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
its
also
a
bit
too
soda
like
strangely
i
would
have
it
over
many
other
beers
but
i
certainly
dont
feel
the
need
to
want
to
have
this
again
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
sour
cherries
or
gourmetfancy
maraschino
cherries
with
a
flavor
to
match
i
think
of
sweet
vermouth
and
black
cherries
like
23rds
of
an
expertly
made
manhattan
with
a
sweetness
matched
by
a
mild
tartness
i
get
some
of
that
vermouthbitters
aroma
a
layered
aged
sense
of
different
herbs
and
spices
coming
together
and
mellowing
out
and
the
taste
of
cherries
running
throughout
terribly
enjoyable
and
readily
accessible
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
sugar
and
some
very
slight
sour
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
and
sugar
with
no
tartness
whatsoever
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
and
a
horrible
example
of
the
style
enjoyable
sour
wont
light
the
world
on
fire
but
easy
dinker
the
duchess
light
not
bad
though
i
find
it
a
little
too
sweet
and
in
need
of
improved
body
the
low
carbonation
is
also
a
weak
point
though
this
may
have
been
caused
by
poor
handling
my
fault
otherwise
it
has
the
classic
fruity
sourness
of
a
flanders
red
distinct
but
restrained
a
decent
representative
of
these
unique
belgian
beers
worth
trying
o
picked
this
one
up
on
a
whim
saw
this
bottle
right
next
to
duchesse
de
bourgogne
at
my
local
bottle
shop
and
figured
worth
a
try
about
to
open
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
and
will
post
on
that
one
soon
easy
going
perhaps
unremarkable
i
enjoyed
drinking
bourgogne
des
flandres
brown
ale
but
itd
be
hard
to
justify
dropping
the
dollars
to
have
it
again
medium
bodied
and
medium
effervescence
abv
is
not
at
all
noticeable
aftertaste
is
less
tart
more
malt
not
as
good
to
me
at
least
as
duchess
du
borgogne
but
in
the
neighborhood
id
drink
it
again
but
for
the
price
i
can
find
much
better
examples
of
the
style
just
a
bit
too
muted
on
every
aspect
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
one
finger
medium
pinkish
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
sour
fruit
cherries
mellow
flavor
of
cherries
sour
and
sweet
finishes
with
a
well
blended
flavor
of
dark
fruit
malt
and
cherries
somewhat
tangy
moderate
bodied
somewhat
subdued
in
flavor
but
pleasant
and
satisfying
to
drink
this
is
a
one
year
old
bottle
with
unknown
storage
details
may
be
a
bottle
from
distributor
storage
ive
got
2
bottles
left
who
wantsem
o
this
beer
is
bright
with
some
nice
fruity
depth
to
it
and
a
soft
tartness
but
it
becomes
a
bit
too
sweet
as
it
warms
and
the
tartness
is
a
bit
too
mellow
to
combat
that
mmedium
body
maybe
a
bit
syrupy
and
plenty
of
bubbles
this
was
a
nice
unique
taste
treat
but
i
dont
need
to
drink
this
again
taste
berrylicious
sourtastic
nice
and
medium
for
the
sourheads
among
us
is
this
the
duchesse
junior
the
light
sour
sweetness
then
some
sour
very
tasty
but
never
over
the
top
o
its
an
alright
beer
little
light
in
everything
from
nose
to
taste
to
body
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
wont
blow
you
away
oa
nice
flavorful
easy
to
drink
beer
not
overly
anything
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
i
also
wish
it
were
more
sour
o
a
nice
beer
something
different
not
to
sweet
just
try
it
once
drinkability
not
as
tart
as
some
red
ales
i
have
had
but
enjoyable
not
sure
why
this
says
retired
just
had
one
last
night
on
tap
at
burger
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
dark
clear
ruby
black
with
a
sudsy
tan
head
aroma
is
faint
with
light
notes
of
overripe
red
fruit
and
dark
bread
flavor
is
full
of
sugary
cherries
like
cherry
yogurt
with
a
sweet
malty
finish
lacks
the
tartness
of
a
good
flanders
ale
pretty
much
just
alcoholic
soda
o
a
great
flanders
ale
on
the
sweet
side
but
thirst
quenching
and
highly
drinkable
o
not
sour
enough
and
too
malty
i
guess
i
see
why
it
was
retired
overall
the
beer
is
decent
good
but
not
great
fairly
easy
to
drink
one
of
i
think
it
would
be
tough
to
get
past
the
sweetness
for
a
second
or
third
pour
o
drinkable
but
overly
sweet
could
only
drink
one
had
better
flanders
style
before
might
be
an
affordable
segue
into
sours
for
those
who
have
never
tried
them
this
is
a
very
good
looking
beer
nice
dark
brown
color
with
red
edges
and
a
nice
foamy
light
brownish
head
the
smell
is
pretty
light
there
are
some
of
the
flanders
sour
smell
a
little
kriek
cherry
smell
a
little
sweet
mouth
feel
is
light
highly
carbonated
the
taste
is
okay
its
a
little
sweet
some
fruits
almost
tart
but
everything
is
too
mellow
then
a
weird
after
flavor
this
is
definitely
missing
the
ultra
sour
tart
kick
that
i
was
expecting
from
this
style
overall
i
was
looking
for
a
cheaper
flanders
red
besides
la
folie
and
duchesse
de
bourgogne
but
sadly
this
is
just
too
toned
down
for
me
to
get
again
ill
stick
with
the
duchesse
o
this
was
dreadful
stuff
no
thanks
dark
cherry
cola
look
with
little
or
no
smell
what
i
do
smell
is
malt
vinegar
head
is
fluffy
tan
and
plenty
bubbly
tastes
like
cooked
dark
cherries
and
sweet
malt
tart
fruit
from
start
to
finish
with
a
colalike
finish
a
bit
sweet
but
a
nice
sipper
after
dinner
i
like
this
beer
im
hoping
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
because
if
this
is
how
the
brewers
release
this
they
should
just
pack
it
in
dvery
easy
drinking
but
steers
a
little
too
close
to
cloying
for
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
definitely
a
pick
above
many
others
aroma
of
light
bready
malt
sweet
fruit
cherry
and
fig
and
a
hint
of
vinegary
sourness
palate
is
fruitforward
with
lots
of
cherry
sweetness
and
a
bready
malt
base
a
mild
sourness
lingers
on
the
finish
body
is
light
creamy
and
just
a
bit
sticky
while
not
nearly
as
sour
as
some
other
flemish
reds
this
is
still
a
very
tasty
little
number
has
a
deep
amber
colored
pour
with
a
cream
colored
head
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
bit
of
sweet
and
sour
mixed
the
flavor
is
a
little
sour
at
first
but
fades
away
quickly
into
a
sweet
more
drinkable
liquid
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
carbonation
overall
its
not
bad
bit
its
nothing
great
like
a
true
flanders
red
i
could
drink
this
again
if
i
came
across
it
one
day
o
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
of
beer
out
there
this
is
just
not
a
great
one
i
could
see
new
people
to
beer
liking
this
but
it
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
not
offensive
just
a
pretty
average
beer
d
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
but
it
sure
goes
down
easy
my
bottle
didnt
last
long
since
its
so
mellow
a
decent
cheap
flanders
that
fits
the
style
easy
enough
but
like
i
said
its
very
mellow
on
flavor
offered
to
my
lovely
wife
as
an
alternative
to
kasteel
rouge
and
i
must
say
it
was
no
kasteel
rouge
reddishbrown
pour
with
a
light
receding
head
light
fruity
aroma
taste
was
bitter
and
mmm
sickeningly
sour
im
sorry
to
say
sour
in
a
thin
way
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
ok
but
i
probably
would
not
get
this
beer
again
overall
i
enjoyed
each
sip
but
dreaded
the
swallow
for
that
reason
i
would
not
buy
this
again
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
flanders
brown
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
though
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
quite
light
for
the
style
which
i
dont
really
like
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
it
is
even
light
when
you
put
it
beside
a
vichtenaar
take
that
for
what
you
will
i
would
recommend
that
someone
new
to
this
style
give
this
a
shot
before
you
go
to
rodenbach
feel
is
a
nice
medium
build
with
a
nice
carb
thats
not
too
bitey
vinegar
stays
a
bit
and
keeps
this
from
gaining
props
maybe
a
bit
of
age
will
do
something
i
drank
it
and
it
was
not
all
that
bad
give
it
a
go
not
bad
but
not
nearly
of
the
standard
that
duchesse
is
which
is
the
only
beer
this
can
be
judged
against
enjoyable
but
not
the
real
mccoy
bourgogne
des
flandres
a
flanders
oud
bruin
blended
with
lambic
and
aged
for
6
months
in
oak
barrels
it
isnt
bad
exactly
but
it
is
fairly
onedimensional
for
the
style
its
better
once
it
warms
up
but
still
pretty
boring
very
sweet
with
a
vaguely
cherry
colalike
flavor
and
just
a
semblance
of
sourness
reminds
me
of
a
really
shitty
attempt
at
copying
duchesse
de
bourgogne
one
of
my
favorites
it
doesnt
suck
but
i
can
think
of
no
reason
to
buy
this
one
when
there
are
significantly
better
examples
of
the
style
o
a
very
tame
bruin
i
personally
would
like
it
more
if
was
substantially
tarter
and
dryer
the
sweetness
wasnt
overpowering
but
definitely
accentuated
in
this
beer
go
elsewhere
i
like
bellegems
for
a
more
balanced
bruin
drinkabilitythis
one
is
a
fairly
tame
oud
brune
as
these
things
go
its
more
of
a
session
version
of
a
flanders
or
maybe
even
a
fruit
beer
d
not
my
favourite
flanders
red
as
its
a
bit
watery
the
sweetness
does
appear
to
get
sweeter
as
the
beer
warmed
which
isnt
good
but
i
enjoyed
the
beer
from
start
to
finish
not
your
regular
flanders
red
but
one
of
the
best
in
my
eyes
its
a
nice
darkish
color
but
not
all
that
carbonated
small
and
quickly
disappearing
head
and
because
of
the
timid
taste
seemed
less
refreshing
than
other
beers
of
the
same
style
ive
had
muled
back
from
belgium
by
kevin
props
for
that
it
is
almost
black
in
color
with
a
dense
rocky
light
tan
head
it
smells
like
old
leather
and
sort
of
like
bandaids
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
nice
maltiness
and
a
slight
sharpenng
at
the
end
tastes
of
carob
powder
with
a
buttery
note
and
traces
of
strawberry
very
mellow
it
seems
like
im
going
to
like
it
more
than
i
do
somehow
i
like
it
just
not
as
much
as
i
think
i
will
when
i
hit
the
first
sip
mouthfeel
is
creamy
soft
and
sharply
carbonated
at
the
same
time
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
touch
metallic
and
doesnt
make
me
yearn
for
the
next
sip
it
has
a
lot
of
interesting
things
that
it
almost
pulls
off
it
just
seems
the
beer
doesnt
quite
walk
the
talk
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
one
id
have
again
its
one
id
like
to
try
aged
or
on
tap
if
such
exists
to
see
how
variances
would
affect
it
to
sum
it
up
its
got
potential
d
if
youre
not
putoff
by
the
mildness
of
the
beer
too
much
then
its
quite
drinkable
deep
ruby
red
with
reddish
brown
highlights
a
thin
tan
head
with
decent
retention
this
is
ok
the
nose
is
disappointing
with
some
sugar
some
cola
a
little
vanilla
and
no
real
sourness
a
little
musty
this
is
disappointing
the
palate
opens
with
a
mild
tartness
a
mild
rotting
fruitlike
character
some
sugar
and
mild
vanilla
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
mild
tannic
character
this
isnt
very
good
light
in
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
i
really
didnt
enjoy
or
finish
my
pour
small
bottle
offered
up
at
avec
les
bon
veoux
in
brussels
brownred
body
with
ruby
hues
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
this
whispy
lace
aroma
of
candied
cherries
and
oak
with
a
touch
of
funk
and
some
coriander
like
spice
taste
is
cherries
and
prunes
with
some
candied
sugar
and
a
little
woodiness
sour
but
not
insanely
so
light
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
a
reasonably
tasty
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
the
flavours
are
muddled
on
the
palate
and
lack
structure
i
cant
see
me
drinking
much
of
this
d
outstanding
a
dark
belgian
you
can
drink
all
night
and
with
bits
of
everything
vanilla
notes
soft
creamy
sweet
slight
grapelike
fruit
almost
cocoanut
soft
herbalness
lasting
sourness
tastes
pretty
good
feels
pretty
good
good
drinkability
so
perhaps
it
is
what
it
is
d
not
bad
for
a
14
year
old
beer
md
the
carbonation
is
not
as
smooth
and
natural
as
my
other
three
bottles
but
still
light
enough
to
render
an
approachable
palate
to
go
with
the
very
light
flavour
profile
all
in
all
theres
very
little
in
the
glass
that
id
say
has
done
this
style
any
justice
for
its
quite
mediocre
overall
and
just
fails
to
keep
my
interest
pours
a
clear
but
quite
dark
brown
with
ruby
tones
very
small
almost
tan
head
flavor
is
nice
smooth
yet
candy
sweet
a
bit
there
is
that
definite
flanders
ale
taste
slight
wood
with
an
almost
cherry
sweetness
its
not
exactly
the
most
complex
or
mature
profile
but
it
works
nicely
and
i
dig
it
feel
is
a
noticeable
carbonation
but
not
abrasively
full
liquid
is
thick
enough
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
decent
i
dont
know
if
this
is
categorized
wrong
or
if
the
bottle
led
me
to
believe
something
different
but
this
beer
barely
resembles
a
flanders
red
with
that
being
said
it
is
enjoyable
to
drink
but
the
low
score
shows
off
the
difference
from
the
style
the
ingredient
list
reads
flavourings
which
im
assuming
is
a
cherry
syrup
of
some
sort
i
dont
usually
go
for
that
kind
of
thing
but
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
would
appeal
to
a
lot
of
different
folks

overwhelming

obliterating
the

flavours
that

in

in
a
lame
attempt
to
balance
the
beer
out
the
mouthfeel
is

and
sickly
almost
undrinkable

any
quantity
this
beer
has
neither
the
sourness
complexity
or
thirst
quenching
drinkability
of
rodenbach
the
benchmark
for
the
style
a
disappointing
overly
sweet
attempt
its
a
nice
beer
it
didnt
have
the
tart
acidic
fruity
sourness
nor
the
rustic
oak
overtones
that
makes
flanders
ales
so
charming
and
complex
it
did
have

odd

actually
managed
to
leave
me
a
little
less
excited

is
medium
and
lacks
the
subtle
effervescence
that
i
am
used
to
flander
reds
should
be
spritzy

light
feeling
this
is
a
little
heartier
still
tastey
in
its
own
way
but
wouldnt
seek
out
again

drinkability
drinkable
but
a
bit
bland
no
bitterness
reddish
orange
in
color
with
little
head
but
beautiful
lacing
smells
of
brown
sugar
candy
sugars
chocolate
smells
rich
and
delicious
cant
wait
to
get
it
in
my
mouth
but
the
taste
really
takes
a
step
backwards
it
has
very
mellow
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
is
too
understated
after
such
a
thrilling
nose
some
butter
to
it
very
drinkable
but
i
wish
it
were
more
flavorful
attractive
and
promising
dark
mollasses
colour
mollasses
aroma
with
a
sweetness
other
than
mollasses
candy
then
sourness
and
tongue
numbing
that
lasts
6
hours
later
an
experience
that
is
not
necessarily
satisfying
not
complex
but
drinkable
brew
a
bit
of
an
odd
one
too
sweet
to
be
a
true
flanders
and
too
sweet
for
me
anyways
not
bad
just
not
world
changing
tasted
this
bottle
in
t
speelmanshuys
pub
bruges
in
may
2005
i
had
tasted
this
beer
before
in
brussels
some
years
previously
on
tap
in
a
limaige
de
nostre
dame
and
had
been
very
impressed
this
bottle
was
left
for
me
to
pour
but
even
giving
it
some
air
found
it
hard
to
get
a
decent
head
smelled
good
nice
mouthwatering
tang
with
some
hops
tasted
a
little
sharp
mixture
of
sweetness
and
bitter
tang
with
the
bitterness
winning
the
battle
i
was
a
bit
dissappointed
with
the
experience
my
memory
of
the
draft
version
is
what
made
me
order
this
beer
the
draft
bourgogne
is
much
better
being
a
nice
middleoftheday
beer
a
surprisingly
crisp
beer
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
absolutely
no
head
smell
is
very
hard
to
pick
out
but
smells
of
faint
plums
and
raisins
smell
is
surprisingly
crisp
and
light
for
a
beer
this
dark
the
main
taste
is
apricots
and
other
fruits
but
water
is
quick
to
take
away
any
lingering
taste
on
the
tongue
the
effervescing
also
prohibits
anything
form
staying
around
your
mouth
but
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
hard
to
get
any
foam
on
this
beer
very
darkbrown
colored
and
clear
best

so

and
some

getting
into

except
for
the

seems
to
mak
a
comback
after

a

no

definitely
not
a

of
mine
this
one
the
beer
after
its
emancipation
from
the
330ml
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
deep
incarnadine
color
with
the
head
pythonic
in
size
and
the
texture
spumous
the
color
a
beauteous
light
tan
as
it
dwindles
to
nothingness
the
lace
forms
a
tight
skirt
upon
the

nose

almost
astringent
with
a
backing
of

complex
maybe
its
just
this
old
worn
out
schnozzle
of
mine
start
is
quite
sweet
and
light
in
malt
the
top
is
light
with
the
acidity
mild
and
the
hops
benign
in
their
spiciness
aftertaste
is
dry
and
sweet

different

must
say
drinkable
nonetheless
bottle
poured
a
dark

beer
with
a
huge
head
with
pretty
good

really
hits
you
when
you
small
this
beer
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
sweet
cheery
which
is
attributable
to
the
oak
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
watery
which
stop
this
beer
from
being
as
good
as
the
rodenbach
still
a
nice
example
of
the
style
had
twice
at
the
avec
les
bon
veoux
in
brussels
this
is
a
dark
red
brew
with
a
small
whispy
head
of
offwhite
aromas
are
of
cherries
oak
various
spices
yeast
candy
sugar
and
more
the
taste
is
sour
oaky
and
very
cherryish
with
some
nice
spicing
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
nice
i
was
stunned
to
find
this
on
tap
at
a
german
restaurant
in
moscow
of
course
i
had
to
try
it
it
came
in
a
logo
glass
shaped
like
a
martini
glass
the
beer
was
a
deep
clear
ruby
red
under
a
1
5
finger
tan
head
with
contour
and
decent
lacing
but
not
much
retention
the
nose
is
strong
sweet
and
fruity
the
mouth
is
light
and
only
mildly
carbonated
the
opening
is
strawberry
sweet
but
quite
mild
there
is
a
slight
hoppy
finish
leaving
a
good
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
not
at
all
bad
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
body
was
thin
an
the
beer
was
a
bit
under
carbonated
nice
complexity
to
this
brew
ill
probably
pick
a
few
more
of
the
dusty
bottles
up
next
time
i
stop
by
rather
sweet
and
thin
bodied
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
but
still
ok
slightly
tart
cherry
quality
but
nothing
exceptional
light
and
slightly
enjoyable
very
downable
o
this
is
an
excellent
flanders
red
distinctive
for
its
assertive
malt
bill
and
bold
tannic
oakiness
while
flavorful
there
is
a
lightness
here
that
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
it
doesnt
singe
the
tastebuds
it
arrives
and
gracefully
exits
as
the
swallow
indicates
im
not
sure
if
this
is
barrel
aged
or
not
but
there
is
a
semisweet
red
wine
character
to
this
that
is
really
nicely
done
hopefully
this
is
a
sign
of
good
things
to
come
for
bluejackets
sour
program
a
real
nice
take
on
the
style
that
pulls
off
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
o
refreshing
pretty
tasty
and
well
made
not
the
most
mouthpuckering
or
flavorful
sour
out
there
but
that
may
be
a
feature
rather
than
a
bug
o
nice
beer
with
some
good
flavors
but
nothing
that
sets
it
head
and
shoulders
above
other
nice
beers
of
this
style
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
though
a
very
nice
and
incredibly
drinkable
version
of
the
style
jordan
mentioned
the
folks
at
alpine
had
given
this
bottle
to
him
before
its
eventual
release
and
that
it
was
still
very
very
young
perhaps
we
should
have
sat
on
it
for
longer
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
one
again
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
believe
its
the
first
sourish
beer
ive
had
from
alpine
and
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
making
a
flanders
i
found
it
very
vinegary
and
full
of
sour
cherries
and
liked
the
wood
coming
through
in
the
nose
and
mouth
would
love
to
have
it
again
sometime
d
even
with
some
minor
flaws
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
and
had
no
problem
finishing
a
few
pours
i
dig
the
lower
abv
particularly
after
all
the
highalcohol
avery
sours
ive
had
recently
i
think
alpine
could
have
a
winner
here
with
a
few
tweaks
to
the
next
batch
overall
an
excellent
brew
would
recommend
again
my
buddy
didnt
like
sour
beers
after
8hrs
at
alpine
ned
was
his
new
fav
and
converted
him
to
the
land
of
sours
bravo
o
overall
this
is
a
good
but
somewhat
dry
red
the
overall
character
is
tart
mildly
agressive
and
mildly
tannic
overallthis
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
hints
of
sourness
and
complexity
from
notes
at
the
pub
on
28
d
soooo
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
bring
a
growler
of
this
home
with
me
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
cherry
flavor
is
fantastic
could
be
a
little
more
tart
but
otherwise
phenomenal
i
need
more
of
this
overall
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
am
enjoying
good
work
alpine
d
i
sipped
on
this
one
for
a
good
hour
and
a
half
i
still
need
to
explore
this
style
but
this
one
definitely
excited
me
to
try
more
that
is
how
i
would
say
its
very
drinkable
overall
an
enjoyable
flanders
red
ale
at
a
great
price
but
alpine
reigns
supreme
in
the
hoppy
category
and
id
rather
be
drinking
one
of
their
hoppy
beers
though
id
rather
be
drinking
one
of
those
than
most
other
beers
so
thats
irrelevant
and
not
very
informative
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
when
it
was
first
released
but
a
short
amount
of
time
has
done
it
great
credit
and
its
now
more
enjoyable
d
not
bad
but
ill
go
elsewhere
for
a
sour
alpine
owns
the
ipa
category
surprised
to
see
an
alpine
beer
that
wasnt
an
ipa
like
the
effort
but
not
executed
as
well
huge
flanders
fan
and
this
just
doesnt
even
come
close
pours
ruby
win
some
brownish
coloring
off
white
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
nose
brings
forward
oak
acetic
vinegar
notes
and
some
cherries
taste
wraps
it
all
together
pretty
well
with
he
acetic
acid
and
the
cherries
mixing
with
the
oak
leading
to
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
toward
then
end
the
vinegar
flavors
get
to
be
a
bit
much
affecting
its
drinkability
overall
a
was
disappointed
in
this
one
i
have
loved
all
the
other
alpines
that
ive
had
so
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
especially
since
i
love
the
style
a
little
more
secondary
aroma
and
flavors
would
really
jump
this
one
up
as
it
already
has
a
good
sour
vinegar
base
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
got
from
milt
rotation
not
avail
here
and
was
hard
to
get
so
id
say
one
is
enough
unless
the
stars
aligned
just
right
would
love
to
try
at
the
brewery
on
the
next
sd
trip
if
available
oy
d
this
is
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
a
nice
american
effort
on
a
style
weve
still
got
a
long
way
to
go
on
im
hoping
alpine
can
make
this
consistently
reading
some
of
the
reviews
led
me
think
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
tame
american
attempt
at
a
flanders
but
not
here
hopefully
this
wasnt
just
a
good
batch
apline
is
a
tiny
roadtrip
away
so
ill
be
giving
this
another
taste
poured
a
dark
maroon
with
ruby
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
a
good
interpretation
of
a
flanders
red
which
consisted
of
vinegar
sour
cherries
some
oak
and
slight
acidic
notes
upfront
the
sour
cherries
really
blend
nice
with
the
vinegar
flavors
with
oaky
notes
coming
through
to
accent
the
overall
taste
i
was
also
glad
that
the
beer
was
not
overly
acidic
too
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
sweet
fruity
sour
and
slight
acidic
finish
it
drank
pretty
damn
good
and
im
always
happy
to
try
new
sour
beers
decent
flanders
good
job
alpine
d
this
has
not
been
a
style
that
i
have
frequently
had
yet
each
time
i
have
had
one
i
really
enjoy
it
this
ned
is
delicious
and
i
see
myself
sipping
on
this
throughout
my
evening
happily
i
would
seek
this
out
again
but
not
sure
if
alpine
is
doing
this
one
on
a
regularirregular
basis
overall
a
pretty
decent
flanders
with
a
lot
of
solid
flavors
good
drinkability
i
could
have
more
of
this
one
bottle
shared
courtesy
of
mothman
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
slightly
murky
tan
head
with
a
nice
collar
tart
fruit
aroma
sweet
and
tart
flavors
with
a
slight
vinegar
taste
bretty
notes
as
well
curious
as
to
the
barrel
they
use
to
age
this
cherries
also
in
the
nose
light
mouthfeel
a
really
good
beer
in
my
opinion
wish
this
was
more
available
the
only
knock
is
that
it
could
be
a
tad
bit
more
sour
dpretty
solid
beer
here
a
little
sweet
but
a
nice
oak
presence
and
interesting
balance
of
brett
the
acidity
is
more
powerful
in
the
nose
than
the
taste
d
not
the
best
flanders
red
but
a
pretty
decent
interpretation
i
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
over
a
year
when
it
was
first
mentioned
and
am
glad
to
have
done
so
overall
more
sweet
than
sour
on
the
continuum
with
notable
wood
influences
and
a
light
tartness
and
with
a
finish
that
s
a
bit
short
sweetness
is
more
apparent
in
feel
than
in
flavor
however
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
opening
this
brew
poured
a
semihazy
burnished
mahogany
with
a
mere
skim
of
a
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin
band
that
coalesced
around
the
edges
nose
expresses
sour
notes
cranberries
and
sucrets
taste
reveals
vanilla
cinnamon
and
lightly
soured
fruit
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
little
astringency
that
comes
out
towards
the
back
an
interesting
spice
character
not
typically
associated
with
the
style
but
lacking
some
of
the
qualities
ive
come
to
expect
and
appreciate
this
beer
almost
tastes
like
a
lot
of
things
which
i
guess
means
complexity
sessionable
the
beer
pours
a
red
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
some
light
tartness
the
flavor
is
fruit
iced
tea
light
tartness
and
caramel
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
pretty
nice
flanders
red
ale
but
not
among
the
best
i
have
tried
a
highly
drinkable
flanders
red
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
if
you
get
the
chance
the
palate
opens
with
berrylike
tartness
mild
vinegar
and
tannic
oak
its
thin
almost
watery
and
rather
vinous
and
oaky
theres
a
mineralmetallic
note
in
the
finish
that
detracts
a
bit
but
the
biggest
flaw
is
that
the
body
and
flavors
of
the
beer
dont
hold
up
to
the
oak
still
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
and
quite
enjoyable
good
effort
from
the
guys
at
alpine
ive
revisited
this
and
there
is
now
a
funk
to
it
that
wasnt
there
before
its
a
subtle
and
pleasant
funk
that
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
not
to
sweet
nor
to
tart
a
great
flanders
for
sure
d
nice
little
beer
thanks
alpine
nice
pleasant
enough
if
moderately
priced
would
buy
all
the
time
good
beer
overall
though
does
alpine
make
a
bad
one
if
so
i
havent
had
it
highly
drinkable
this
one
is
i
am
a
sourbelgian
noob
but
i
have
had
a
couple
to
date
and
i
think
that
ned
from
alpine
is
the
best
one
that
i
have
had
so
far
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
beer
if
i
can
make
it
back
over
to
alpine
before
they
run
out
this
was
a
very
good
flanders
red
nice
balance
between
sour
and
tart
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
seek
out
more
of
this
overall
an
amazing
beer
just
happened
to
find
it
on
the
bottle
menu
and
thought
it
sounded
wonderful
and
it
really
is
wonderful
sour
without
being
hard
to
drink
something
i
would
love
to
drink
a
ton
of
i
know
this
will
be
the
only
time
i
get
to
drink
this
and
that
is
disappointing
because
i
would
gladly
buy
bottles
for
home
within
reason
of
price
of
course
very
alive
open
up
room
cellar
temp
55
and
gave
a
great
head
retention
cheers
short
review
this
was
a
very
nice
flanders
red
its
just
what
i
expect
from
the
style
and
i
thought
it
had
the
right
amount
of
sour
without
being
overly
acidic
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
was
happy
to
have
the
chance
to
try
it
it
would
be
great
to
see
them
distribute
it
i
wouldnt
mind
if
they
canned
it
but
im
sure
they
would
go
the
wax
dipped
bottle
route
this
is
a
really
great
tasting
and
very
smooth
flanders
style
red
it
has
a
mild
sour
flavor
but
in
a
really
good
way
the
appearance
is
just
beautiful
it
is
a
rich
red
with
a
white
light
bubbly
head
it
is
very
clear
also
a
sign
of
what
is
to
come
i
had
a
nice
smell
fruity
and
mild
with
lightly
sour
smell
the
taste
is
very
mild
and
smooth
but
with
great
flavor
the
sourness
is
very
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
the
mouth
feel
is
excellent
and
the
beer
disappeared
very
quickly
did
i
say
it
was
smooth
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
as
i
am
fast
becoming
a
major
fan
of
sours
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
aroma
this
showed
boldness
with
excellent
sour
yeastiness
and
bite
especially
as
it
warmed
the
flavoring
showed
more
of
the
same
but
was
a
bit
light
for
the
style
and
our
taste
buds
alike
the
malts
too
were
on
the
darker
and
more
bittered
side
taking
away
from
the
styles
usual
sweeter
fruity
inclusions
and
making
a
more
malt
forward
and
dominant
beverage
with
this
beer
it
seemed
like
they
were
trying
to
ease
up
on
the
overt
sourness
and
fruitiness
of
the
style
and
instead
make
it
more
approachable
for
people
who
may
not
be
familiar
with
such
bold
beers
while
this
certainly
aids
drinkability
it
makes
it
slightly
less
exciting
for
those
of
us
who
want
to
be
knocked
off
our
seats
with
those
unique
flavors
that
said
this
was
a
tasty
treat
and
again
something
highly
approachable
and
drinkable
for
many
tmo
in
a
word
wow
tart
blueberry
w
a
balaton
cherry
sourness
drinks
fantastic
super
awesome
one
of
if
not
the
best
blueberry
beers
i
have
had
so
jammy
very
impressed
with
all
sp
beers
thus
far
sour
was
puckering
o
not
bad
with
a
nice
unique
twist
on
a
traditional
flanders
red
throwing
in
a
fruity
blueberry
presence
the
base
beer
however
was
fairly
average
for
me
with
a
little
bit
too
much
acidity
pour
is
a
murky
muddy
purple
with
a
thin
pink
head
that
dissipates
immediately
not
really
much
blueberry
in
the
nose
tons
of
rubber
acetic
acid
and
plastic
there
is
a
faint
blueberry
skin
in
there
but
not
the
dominant
aroma
taste
has
a
bit
more
blueberry
fairly
juicy
a
touch
meaty
acetic
acid
isnt
as
strong
as
i
thought
from
the
nose
a
fair
bit
of
it
through
the
finish
some
rubbery
notes
mid
palate
fuller
body
a
bit
granule
very
dry
and
moderate
carb
overall
the
sourness
is
just
too
intense
and
unpleasant
for
me
good
introduction
to
the
cory
king
way
cheers
o
tastes
like
fuzzy
but
with
blueberries
the
blueberries
really
come
through
which
is
nice
the
yogurty
vinegary
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
but
unique
if
you
like
blueberry
yogurt
this
is
the
beer
for
you
verdict
a
very
very
enjoyable
blueberry
sour
from
side
project
the
base
beer
carries
the
fruit
superbly
well
and
stays
bright
and
delicate
rather
than
heavy
and
muddled
its
complex
balanced
and
very
well
developed
and
that
pucker
sensation
at
the
finish
is
perfection
itself
its
a
fantastic
beer
extremely
sour
so
if
thats
not
your
thing
you
probably
wont
like
it
the
blueberries
are
well
done
and
dont
overpower
though
im
not
sure
anything
can
overpower
the
pucker
after
drinking
this
i
have
major
traders
regret
for
giving
up
a
far
better
beer
but
oh
well
at
least
i
got
to
try
it
fuzzy
got
my
expectations
up
a
little
too
much
i
suppose
o
very
good
im
not
sure
its
worth
what
it
trades
for
but
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
very
good
stuff
but
im
starting
to
get
the
sense
that
side
project
has
that
particular
lacto
flavour
in
all
of
their
beers
so
far
poured
from
bottle
pours
a
chunky
purplish
red
with
visible
remnants
of
blueberry
flesh
and
skins
somewhat
hazy
appearance
not
sure
if
all
bottles
pour
this
way
or
if
this
needed
more
time
in
the
fridge
to
settle
out
appearance
isnt
the
prettiest
but
im
going
to
let
that
slide
due
to
the
strengths
in
the
other
categories
the
nose
has
a
very
classic
flanders
red
nose
with
heavy
oak
strong
acetic
qualities
as
well
as
some
tannic
notes
tart
blueberries
bring
a
brightness
to
the
acidity
and
pair
well
with
the
wine
character
the
taste
is
expertly
balance
as
per
side
project
fashion
blueberries
come
through
with
strong
tartness
and
a
hint
of
juicy
muffin
like
sweetness
this
quickly
gives
way
to
heavy
oak
and
chardonnay
notes
finish
is
tart
and
leaves
the
palate
wanting
more
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
overall
delicious
the
fruited
brews
that
side
project
has
released
so
far
are
ridiculously
tastey
as
are
the
others
and
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
the
future
releases
overall
i
missed
trying
a
sample
of
this
beer
a
few
years
back
when
it
made
an
appearance
at
2012
fobab
under
the
perennial
artisan
ales
brand
it
haunted
me
until
today
really
glad
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
nice
twist
on
the
flanders
red
style
using
blueberries
it
actually
makes
this
beer
smell
and
taste
more
like
a
fruit
lambic
that
of
a
flanders
red
style
sour
ale
irreguardless
what
a
fantastic
sour
beer
it
did
not
dissapoint
at
all
this
has
developed
nicely
the
sharp
acidity
and
tartness
has
died
quite
a
bit
which
is
a
good
think
for
this
beer
starting
to
get
a
little
more
blueberry
flavors
on
the
finish
and
its
actually
moving
towards
tasting
like
blueberry
pieesque
i
think
more
time
will
help
this
beer
out
even
more
really
happy
with
the
progress
in
taste
on
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
garnet
maroon
color
speckled
by
coarse
sediment
and
topped
by
a
thin
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
has
a
slight
blueberrycherry
acetic
kick
some
funk
and
saline
and
bb
muffiny
malts
as
it
warms
there
is
mostly
flanders
upfront
but
it
finishes
with
lingering
tart
acidic
blueberry
skin
its
a
surprisingly
tart
and
acidic
medium
bodied
and
minimally
carbonated
flanders
that
has
a
subtle
yet
distinct
blueberry
profile
i
dont
pick
up
tremendous
oak
and
the
expected
cherrylike
fruitiness
is
neckandneck
with
the
blueberries
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
and
expect
it
to
develop
in
a
really
fantastic
way
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
really
have
no
frame
of
reference
with
another
blueberry
sour
to
compare
it
to
personally
i
would
have
liked
to
see
this
one
stray
a
little
more
towards
the
blueberry
profile
and
away
from
the
flanders
acidic
sour
qualities
but
that
being
said
it
is
still
among
the
best
flanders
reds
ive
had
and
the
blueberries
add
a
great
dimension
o
overall
this
is
a
really
good
and
tart
sour
full
of
fresh
blueberry
juice
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
and
thought
it
was
one
of
the
better
blueberry
sours
that
ive
ever
had
usually
blueberry
sours
dont
have
a
lot
of
blueberry
presence
but
this
one
was
loaded
with
juicy
blueberry
goodness
improved
aroma
and
taste
no
plastic
or
acetic
notes
fruit
juice
and
melted
popsicle
very
sour
hard
to
drink
in
quantity
but
good
raising
scores
across
the
board
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
strong
sour
beers
and
this
delivered
overall
very
nice
it
may
not
be
the
best
sour
in
the
world
but
its
up
in
the
top
group
for
sure
i
spent
a
long
time
trying
different
beers
to
match
my
experience
with
storms
sours
to
no
avail
finally
ive
found
a
few
that
are
on
the
same
level
but
the
storm
flanders
continues
to
hold
its
own
pours
a
hazy
honey
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
fruit
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
real
nice
beer
from
a
gem
of
a
local
brewery
more
sours
please
james
o
amazing
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
while
it
may
not
be
on
par
with
the
best
continental
european
versions
of
the
style
in
terms
of
subtlety
it
reminded
me
more
of
russian
river
consecration
taste
is
pretty
tart
with
a
pleasant
cheese
rind
funk
somewhat
one
dimensional
but
tasty
and
drinkable
significant
oaky
presence
if
this
was
12
99
a
750
id
drink
it
often
but
the
ultra
premium
of
129oz
is
a
little
much
this
does
doesnt
really
approach
traditional
lambic
though
it
seems
thats
what
it
was
shooting
for
i
did
enjoy
it
not
at
all
a
flanders
red
the
beer
was
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
deep
clear
red
with
a
small
thin
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
beer
gave
off
a
very
nice
sour
aroma
acidic
and
citrus
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
nice
sharp
sourness
to
it
with
a
light
body
which
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
would
have
had
a
few
more
if
i
could
have
overall
the
style
says
flanders
red
as
i
review
this
but
it
reminds
me
much
more
of
a
oak
soured
pale
the
cherry
juice
creates
a
well
balanced
sweetnsour
with
brettanomyces
yeast
the
smell
definitely
has
some
funky
earth
to
it
lots
of
brettanomyces
funkiness
not
a
lot
of
sweet
sour
or
cherry
would
have
liked
more
of
all
three
overall
though
its
like
a
kriek
and
standard
flanders
red
ale
mixed
into
one
absolutely
great
beer
love
it
poured
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
a
solid
flanders
red
from
de
proef
brouwerij
o
a
nicely
balanced
and
minor
twist
on
a
classic
style
but
not
altogether
mind
blowing
worth
a
try
id
pick
it
up
again
for
a
refresher
overall
not
extremely
memorable
but
still
a
good
beer
not
sure
that
i
would
get
this
again
but
would
recommend
as
a
good
beginner
beer
for
someone
new
to
sours
sour
cherry
note
predominates
the
sourness
is
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
but
it
makes
for
a
very
friendly
beer
hints
of
clove
and
black
pepper
linger
toward
the
finish
given
the
sweet
and
sour
nature
this
finishes
quite
dry
mediumlight
in
body
carbonation
could
be
a
touch
more
heightened
to
liven
up
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
more
but
as
it
stands
it
is
a
nice
food
beer
we
enjoyed
vegetarian
stirfry
noodles
and
it
complimented
but
cut
through
the
soy
flavor
nicely
othis
beer
gets
props
for
tasting
like
real
cherry
juice
but
im
not
sure
that
real
cherry
juice
flavor
makes
for
a
good
beer
in
this
instance
as
noted
above
it
tastes
more
like
a
outofdate
kids
juice
box
than
a
flanders
red
ale
a
little
more
useful
acidity
might
have
helped
here
sampled
from
a
750ml
bottle
nice
appearance
with
a
reddish
brown
color
and
a
moderate
beige
head
lively
aroma
has
fruit
and
a
hint
of
the
sourtartfunk
to
come
the
sourtartfunky
flavor
is
balanced
and
well
behaved
yet
complex
and
inspiring
i
really
enjoyed
it
from
start
to
finish
o
this
beer
isnt
very
sour
so
it
would
make
for
a
good
beer
for
someone
to
try
that
is
trying
the
style
for
the
first
time
theres
just
enough
cherries
and
sweetness
to
prevent
this
from
being
very
sour
lighter
side
of
medium
body
with
some
creamy
mouthfeel
due
to
the
good
amount
of
tiny
carbonation
a
strange
beer
that
i
doubt
i
would
try
again
as
there
are
many
better
flanders
red
available
compared
to
this
the
beer
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
more
popular
cherry
sour
ales
but
isnt
as
dry
as
the
more
authentic
kriek
ales
its
medium
intensity
and
medium
weight
makes
it
ideally
suited
for
likeminded
cuisine
like
mu
shu
pork
pours
out
a
hazy
rusty
red
cherry
smell
is
pretty
big
up
front
faint
tart
smell
in
the
background
but
cherry
pushes
it
out
taste
is
interesting
not
your
typical
flemish
red
has
a
pretty
big
hit
of
brett
along
with
the
usual
tartness
the
cherry
is
a
little
much
kind
of
sweet
too
fairly
heavy
body
with
some
stinging
carbonation
although
low
carbonation
weird
i
think
id
like
this
a
whole
lot
more
if
it
werent
for
the
cherry
this
is
going
down
the
drain
it
has
some
nice
flavors
mixed
in
with
just
not
good
ones
it
honestly
is
impossible
to
get
past
10
oz
of
this
which
means
a
full
16
oz
pour
is
going
down
the
drain
id
worry
about
an
old
bottle
but
this
style
shouldnt
be
hurt
by
some
age
sorry
but
apples
and
cherry
a
great
ideas
in
a
sour
but
it
has
to
be
sour
this
isnt
sour
it
isnt
good
overall
its
almost
good
too
sweet
with
odd
offnotes
this
pours
a
hazy
slighty
yeast
dregs
tea
brown
with
a
small
short
lived
tan
head
which
doesnt
leave
a
lacing
the
smells
are
slighly
funky
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
cherries
and
barnyard
funk
from
brett
a
slight
vinegar
smell
the
feel
is
medium
okay
carbonination
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
followed
by
a
very
strong
earthy
funky
brett
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
sourness
more
of
a
sweet
and
funk
than
a
sweet
and
sour
nice
though
overall
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
very
much
the
flat
medicinal
grainy
taste
ruined
it
for
me
overall
solid
version
f
the
style
a
welcoming
volume
with
the
bomber
providing
plenty
to
appreciate
try
this
not
as
funky
as
id
like
in
a
red
the
malt
possesses
great
depth
and
character
but
needs
more
funky
foil
o
i
really
like
this
one
im
new
to
the
style
so
maybe
thats
part
of
it
but
im
pleased
totally
different
than
any
other
flemish
red
ive
had
pours
a
little
redder
than
copper
with
a
touch
of
haze
and
a
one
inch
tan
head
that
has
nice
patchy
retention
smells
smokey
familiar
but
i
dont
know
how
also
lots
of
tart
cherries
in
the
nose
yeasty
too
flavor
is
so
weird
earthy
but
its
got
a
beef
jerkey
sort
of
flavor
that
comes
from
the
aroma
hard
to
describe
really
any
cherry
or
brett
flavors
take
a
back
seat
to
that
beefy
meaty
smoke
flavor
i
dont
dislike
it
but
its
really
different
feel
is
good
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
at
the
most
a
750ml
is
a
lot
of
this
beer
but
it
works
for
me
i
guess
worth
a
try
for
its
distinct
aromatic
and
flavor
profile
but
dont
come
in
expecting
a
traditional
flemish
sour
not
as
sour
as
i
hoped
recommended
but
dont
go
in
expecting
too
much

taste
is
of
sour
cherry
and
mild
brett
funk
up
front
with
some
earthy
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
and
is
indeed
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
only
a
slight
crispness
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
was
a
little
disappointed
at
first
because
i
like
outrageously
sour
beers
this
is
way
drinkable
just
very
tame
for
my
palate
might
be
a
good
beer
for
folks
gettin
their
toes
wet
with
sour
beers
o
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
like
a
bit
more
sour
o
overall
i
have
had
better
but
not
terrible
3
5
d
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
it
costs
about
as
much
as
rodenbach
though
so
i
dont
see
a
reason
to
buy
this
one
again
decent
but
definitely
had
better
may
drink
again
if
given
a
bottle
o
superb
a
yeast
lovers
beer
balanced
sweet
and
sour
as
the
name
says
a
rather
underwhelming
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
much
very
artificial
flavor
small
servings
are
suggested
with
this
beer
a
little
goes
a
long
way
i
would
have
no
hesitation
with
buying
another
bottle
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
perfection
in
a
glass
this
is
a
5
for
me
i
was
suprised
though
at
the
lack
of
sourness
this
beer
had
note
this
cork
is
very
difficult
to
get
off
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
off
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
berries
so
quite
fruity
and
slight
hint
of
funk
in
the
taste
a
nice
tart
sourness
mild
acidity
sugary
malt
and
a
hint
of
cherry
juice
very
well
balanced
with
a
perfect
mix
of
sweet
sour
malt
and
fruit
ever
so
slight
touch
of
red
wine
vinegar
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
drying
overall
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
flanders
style
and
the
fruit
is
downplayed
and
left
in
the
background
where
it
belongs
well
done
overall
a
slightly
fuller
bodied
less
spritzyassertive
version
of
flanders
red
than
duchesse
de
bourgogne
which
i
consider
the
cranberry
soda
of
the
beer
world
very
drinkable
but
not
quite
as
sour
as
i
anticipated
which
is
not
a
knock
this
is
well
within
style
i
do
live
very
close
to
the
jolly
pumpkin
however
and
anticipate
more
than
a
complimentary
sourness
in
sour
ales
as
a
result
this
might
be
a
good
launching
point
for
anyone
wanting
to
be
introduced
to
the
sour
ale
category
flavor
is
drier
than
i
expected
not
extreamly
sour
either
but
a
nice
refreshing
combination
of
the
two
base
flavors
quite
refreshing
very
drinkable
with
a
supple
mouthfeel
that
invites
another
retained
swishing
mouthful
mouthfeel
want
a
bit
more
sour
in
there
great
to
perfect
carbonation
medium
to
thick
body
no
cloying
extremely
drinkable
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
d
this
was
a
nice
flanders
red
the
sourness
was
very
balanced
with
sweetness
the
body
was
a
bit
weak
but
there
was
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
probably
best
fresh
because
the
cherry
character
will
likely
fade
with
age
recommended
o
overall
this
was
a
really
great
beer
i
expected
that
it
would
be
really
sour
and
it
wasnt
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
people
to
try
who
want
to
enjoy
a
slightly
sour
beer
without
it
being
overwhelming
d
very
drinkable
introductory
sour
yum
overall
a
good
example
of
a
style
for
the
flemish
sour
not
as
sour
as
dutchess
or
monks
cafe
nor
as
vegetal
as
bourgogne
de
flandres
a
very
effective
compromise
if
i
hadnt
drank
this
against
duchesse
i
probably
would
have
liked
it
more
overall
its
nice
but
not
great
verdict
good
and
unique
beer
thats
worth
the
price
the
taste
is
a
little
tougher
to
measure
the
beer
falls
somewhere
between
the
sweetness
of
a
duchesse
and
the
tartness
of
a
rodenbach
but
not
quite
as
good
as
either
the
beer
is
tilted
towards
the
sweetish
side
but
has
a
tartness
some
cherry
mouthpuckering
and
lots
of
belgian
yeastiness
to
complement
the
sweetness
the
beer
definitely
gets
more
balanced
as
it
warms
too
chilled
and
the
tartness
is
just
not
felt
the
beer
is
complex
has
plenty
of
unique
yeast
qualities
that
bring
out
the
sourishness
in
the
otherwise
fairly
sweet
malts
the
cherry
flavors
are
also
quite
complex
and
run
the
gamut
from
mouthpuckering
tartness
to
slightly
sour
to
marachino
like
in
their
sweetness
theres
lots
going
on
in
this
beer
lots
to
like
but
i
prefer
a
duchesse
or
a
rodenbach
just
a
bit
more
the
flemish
red
style
is
a
real
treat
lchaim
pretty
good
flemish
here
i
didnt
find
this
amazing
but
i
can
see
myself
grabbing
this
one
again
i
split
this
with
galengeueze
we
decided
this
was
worth
a
repurchase
but
as
it
was
a
750
ml
bottle
it
not
something
we
would
want
to
drink
alone
as
it
was
more
of
a
dessert
style
and
not
a
session
beer
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
pours
a
very
hazy
ambercherry
cola
color
with
some
nice
sudsy
off
white
head
about
a
finger
very
nice
lacing
and
some
good
retention
smells
very
barrelyfunky
some
cherry
and
dried
fruit
coming
through
a
little
of
that
sweet
belgian
sugar
scent
and
a
light
spicy
yeast
smell
flavor
is
very
soft
for
a
sour
sweet
upfront
middling
tartness
cherries
throughout
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
nice
consistent
creamy
little
bubbles
gonna
be
a
stretch
to
finish
this
whole
bottle
but
all
in
all
a
good
brew
d
having
a
hard
time
enjoying
this
one
its
tolerable
but
i
wish
the
bottle
wasnt
750mls
ended
up
pouring
half
out
drinkability
decent
by
also
one
of
the
worst
ive
had
in
the
style
this
wonderful
flemish
ale
could
become
a
regular
in
my
beer
cellar
i
could
see
this
being
a
very
drinkable
flanders
red
it
doesnt
insist
upon
itself
the
way
some
do
but
its
the
real
deal
lots
of
sourness
and
interesting
undertones
could
see
this
becoming
a
regular
drinker
split
a
large
bottle
at
the
farmhouse
wow
i
think
this
is
the
best
flemish
red
ive
had
it
lacks
the
sicklysweet
hit
like
in
duchess
and
instead
has
an
almost
dry
fruit
punch
taste
with
apples
and
berries
of
course
the
beer
is
dominated
by
by
sour
brett
character
with
an
orvallike
catty
flavor
over
sweaty
funk
and
lemon
peel
very
drinkable
flanders
red
despite
the
sweetness
detracting
a
bit
for
myself
cherry
juice
really
rounds
this
beer
out
well
could
have
many
more
glasses
this
isnt
a
flanders
red
to
me
but
a
really
nice
brett
wild
ale
i
recommend
this
drink
is
pretty
good
sourtart
flavors
hit
hard
but
not
overwhelming
some
vinegar
and
acidic
flavors
but
overall
pretty
drinkable
db
sweet
but
it
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
here
the
smell
is
absolutely
fantastic
complex
with
nice
cherry
very
smooth
light
drinkable
carbonation
is
spot
on
im
pretty
unfamiliar
with
this
style
but
this
felt
pretty
solid
very
drinkable
sour
great
balance
mfd
moderater
body
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
would
be
better
if
it
wasnt
for
that
damn
grape
soda
flavor
nice
dryness
in
the
finish
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
color
is
a
red
amber
with
a
good
light
tan
head
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
red
wine
tart
cherries
mild
vinegar
and
a
bit
of
funk
the
taste
adds
in
a
bit
of
oak
and
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
acetic
acid
good
puckering
feel
with
some
light
funk
and
oak
drinks
quite
well
another
enjoyable
brew
from
de
proef
drinkability
pretty
good
i
like
it
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
very
nice
the
strongest
taste
is
the
sour
cherries
and
some
hops
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
maltiness
and
the
hops
though
fruity
alcohol
and
sourness
was
evident
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
very
little
carbonation
so
it
was
a
little
flat
in
the
mouth
as
i
drank
more
of
this
the
sourness
became
too
strong
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
withblittle
to
no
head
the
smell
is
very
interesting
it
has
a
slight
lactic
and
acetic
sourness
along
with
a
meatlike
quality
partially
good
partially
bad
on
the
palate
it
is
much
better
there
is
a
slight
residual
sweetness
to
acompany
the
sourness
that
is
very
nice
a
downside
is
the
same
aroma
comes
back
up
through
the
back
of
my
nose
bringing
with
it
the
meat
quality
the
beer
grows
on
me
though
as
i
drink
more
of
it
d
not
something
that
can
be
downed
quickly
but
definately
a
very
enjoyable
beverage
pours
a
redbrown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
i
get
alot
of
strawberry
and
a
portlike
sweetness
on
the
nose
a
slight
acidity
and
a
light
sour
twang
round
sweet
with
a
sourbitter
finish
rich
cherry
candy
sweetness
a
dessert
sipper
possibly
a
bit
too
rich
for
my
tastes
although
the
beer
is
pretty
medium
in
body
i
probably
wont
finish
this
bottle
or
the
other
5
i
somehow
came
into
along
the
road
another
strange
brew
from
de
proef
d
my
tasting
partner
silently
decided
to
abstain
from
the
rest
of
this
bottle
and
i
ended
up
pouring
out
my
last
glass
it
was
just
not
good
drinkability
i
didnt
finish
the
bottle
this
was
just
a
little
one
dimensional
d
after
pouring
i
knew
i
was
going
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
had
a
moment
a
few
years
ago
when
i
got
big
into
soursoud
bruinsetc
and
this
beer
might
have
restarted
it
will
seek
out
the
cantillons
and
drie
fonteinens
of
the
world
d
i
havent
been
all
that
crazy
about
a
lot
of
the
de
proef
beers
but
this
one
was
very
nice
ill
have
to
see
how
the
bottles
in
my
cellar
hold
up
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brownred
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
with
some
sour
wheat
lemons
brett
funk
and
vegetables
the
flavor
is
sour
wheat
citrus
lemons
sour
dark
fruit
corn
green
vegetables
and
cherries
a
very
odd
mix
of
flavors
but
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
real
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
bought
two
of
these
awesome
easy
drinking
beer
love
the
sweetsour
quality
of
the
brew
real
nice
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
up
front
which
quickly
gives
way
to
a
sweet
yet
tart
fruit
flavor
that
lingers
into
a
dry
finish
prominent
earthy
oak
with
hints
of
vanilla
adds
nice
complexity
and
balances
out
the
lactic
sourness
and
sweet
tart
dark
berry
flavor
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
d
my
friends
tried
half
the
bottle
and
quit
im
struggling
to
finish
up
here
and
thought
i
have
some
time
to
go
back
and
write
the
review
something
i
dont
normally
do
with
the
great
ones
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
especially
at
7
deproef
continues
to
be
my
favorite
belgian
brewery
at
the
moment
their
list
of

is
something

even
considering
the

taste
is
a
litlle
disappointing
doesnt
have
the
tang
of
a
rodenbach
or
quite
the
pucker
of
la
folie
has
some
cherry
and
sour
fruit
notes
but
overall
the
taste
profile
is
just
a
little
flat
low
carbonation
so
this
is
pretty
easy
to
put
away
but
i
probably
would
look
at
other
choices
i
ended
up
pouring
some
into
my
5gl
batch
of
kriek
fermenting
away
in
the
bathroom
it
is
going
to
end
up
quite
the
potpourri
d
oh
sweet
nectar
of
the
gods
the
definition
of
drinkability
complex
enough
to
keep
your
interest
through
the
entire
bottle
and
yet
light
enough
abv
7
to
make
it
sessionable
another
simply
wonderful
brew
from
the
prof
d
i
couldnt
even
finish
my
glass
the
sweetness
becomes
very
cloying
and
quickly
overall
a
nice
red
ale
maybe
more
of
a
sour
ale
this
beer
just
doesnt
disappoint
by
any
measure
damn
it
tastes
delicious
and
perfect
makes
you
wonder
why
people
rave
over
legitimately
good
american
wild
ales
while
never
mentioning
belgian
greats
beyond
cantillon
cherryplum
alcohol
nice
sweet
counterplay
the
sour
doesnt
reach
bracing
levels
but
is
rather
well
balanced
by
the
sweet
malt
and
sugar
tart
refreshing
addictive
soft
body
silkylike
with
just
enough
carbonation
very
good
d
overall
this
beer
is
a
weak
example
of
one
of
the
greatest
styles
of
beer
in
the
world
i
really
enjoyed
this
bottle
and
will
for
sure
be
picking
up
a
couple
more
to
share
with
others
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
already
having
a
few
other
sour
ales
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
begin
your
introduction
why
are
you
still
reading
this
give
this
a
pass
o
a
well
balenced
fanders
red
easy
drinker
for
the
style
there
are
other
sour
ales
that
will
blow
it
away
on
the
pucker
rating
as
the
beer
warms
more
complexities
come
through
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
has
not
tried
a
sour
ale
before
introducing
them
to
more
inyourface
sour
beers
not
too
bad
i
expect
it
reflects
the
style
and
that
i
will
be
trying
more
of
the
same
as
the
chance
arises
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
very
drinkable
as
a
sour
ale
i
like
it
d
my
first
sip
was
awesome
the
next
werent
so
aweinspiring
but
this
is
a
great
beer
i
am
having
no
problem
finishing
this
750
not
sure
i
would
reach
for
another
right
now
but
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
well
worth
seeking
out
highly
recommended
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
not
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
and
not
a
substitute
for
my
poor
missing
rodenbach
cant
say
enough
about
how
much
i
admire
this
brew
from
a
fine
brewery
de
proef
has
been
a
great
find
for
me
so
far
and
this
brew
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
good
flavor
all
around
and
a
nice
presentation
a
nice
flemish

that
i
would
have
again

interesting
and
different
eclectic
belgian
lovers
will
surely
enjoy
this
one
a
nice

with
a
mild

and
a
unique

still

wonderfully
with
the

not

very
nice
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
wish
this
were
a
tad
sweeter
the
tartness
is
wonderful
but
needs
to
be
balanced
by
more
sweetness
id
still
have
to
go
with
rodenbach
duchesse
or
goudenband
over
this
but
its
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
this

the

up

nice
mildly

with
a
dry
hint
in
there
the
taste
was
lacking
in
my
opinion
not
much
depth
the
up

kriek
was
there
from
them
adding
cherry
juice
which
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable

this
a

that

but
i
would
not
call
it
a

the
sourness

carbonation
are
too
in
your
face
and
it
is
the
wrong
kind
of
sourness
compared
to
belgian
originals
rodenbach
and
the
duchess
feature
more
acetic
vinegarlike
character
not
the
lemon
tartness
of
a
lambic
or
berliner
weisse
that
this
beer
features
also
id
expect
a
much
bigger
emphasis
on
malt
with
some
sour
complexity
a
totally
different
approach
than
this
beer
takes
o
i
like
this
overall
though
the
progression
on
the
palate
seems
a
bit
disjointed
hard
to
describe
it
either
needs
some
unifying
element
or
to
lose
the
bitter
still
definitely
recommended
and
i
like
the
tartness
it
made
my
mouth
water
muddy
red
with
a
tiny
white
head
thats
quick
to
dissipate
amazing
funky
fruity
aroma
with
sour
cherries
most
prevalent
not
tart
and
tangy
enough
for
my
taste
though
and
too
light
bodied
its
not
bad
but
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
classics
overall
a
bit
one
dimensional
with
the
sweet
and
tart
cherries
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
this
flanders
red
style
that
is
comparable
to
new
glarus
oud
bruin
definetly
sourim
having
a
hard
time
finding
much
other
flavor
though
has
a
really
earthy
bitter
flavor
did
not
care
for
this
at
all
this
folks
have
to
be
some
of
the
only
ones
putting
sour
beers
like
these
into
cans
so
thats
pretty
cool
right
there
maxing
the
exotic
more
accessible
i
like
this
more
than
others
from
them
so
far
its
extremely
sour
too
with
a
major
pucker
and
not
quite
enough
of
a
caramel
malt
base
to
balance
it
out
in
the
finish
i
found
the
acid
dominating
i
do
like
that
its
not
as
vinegar
forward
as
the
belgian
ones
and
not
quite
as
complex
either
i
dont
really
get
the
wood
and
the
maturity
but
the
taste
is
really
nice
and
i
can
see
this
getting
enormously
popular
as
a
result
of
its
availability
and
overall
quality
amazing
how
many
beers
these
guys
have
launched
into
the
market
all
at
once
huge
takeover
it
seems
like
bright
rust
color
with
a
soft
inch
of
tan
foam
on
it
looks
the
part
just
fine
i
think
it
may
be
a
little
one
dimensional
with
all
the
acidity
but
i
appreciate
what
they
are
shooting
for
with
it
some
serious
cherry
flavors
before
the
finish
dried
tart
and
sweet
all
at
once
very
glad
to
have
canned
options
like
this
in
the
market
heavy
rusty

taste
a
decent
shot
but
not
something
ill
revisit
optional
optional
optional
optional
optional
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
decent
brew
but
not
memorable
cherries
through
and
a
slightly
vinous
finish
pretty
good
had
a
weird
acidic
or
metallic
aftertaste
that
totally
turned
me
off
not
a
very
memorable
brew
o
a
nice
american
version
of
a
flanders
red
and
a
pleasant
surprise
many
of
the
american
versions
ive
had
are
too
medicinal
and
not
tart
enough
but
this
one
is
wonderfully
balanced
a
great
beer
for
the
price
too
falls
a
little
flat
wish
it
had
more
of
that
sour
zing
poured
in
a
tulip
needed
to
have
this
twice
to
confirm
my
thoughts
beautiful
deep
redmaroon
color
with
nice
head
retention
all
downhill
from
here
smells
like
canned
tomatoes
tart
and
metallic
starts
sour
taste
of
tart
cherries
and
ripe
plum
dry
and
very
metallic
finish
like
sucking
on
a
penny
glad
this
only
came
in
a
4
pack
not
something
id
get
again

with
about
an
inch

head

and

are
both
decent
enough
aroma
is

the

smells
like
sweet

tart

vinegar
caramel
and
bready

taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
plum

and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
noticeable
too
i
think
its
mostly
tart
with
a
bit
of
sweetness

is
medium
its
a

a

sour
for
the
price
looks
like
muddy
sludge
smells
vinegary
and
stale
ok
cherry
flavor
but
a
stale
bready
malt
backbone
takes
over
similar
to
the
taste
when
a

stales
into

crappy

of
sorts
honestly
tastes
like
a
crappy
sour
cherry
barleywine
without
the
alcohol
punch
many
thanks
to
the
ba
that
extrad
me
this
but
a
definite
miss
by
the
brewery
on
both
style
and
taste
wild
sour
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
sour
aroma
hints
of
sweet
fruit
the
taste
has
a
noticeable
sour
sweet
fruit
very
dry
crisp
aftertaste
great
flavors
great
body
overall
a
top
notch
sour
poured
a
non
head
copper
color
smelled
like
a
sour
should
but
a
bit
more
grainy
had
a
great
taste
reminded
me
of
the
here
gose
nothing
from
this
brewery
but
this
had
a
bit
of
rye
at
the
end
light
watery
feel
a
nice
beer
it
is
not
like
a
traditional
flanders
but
still
has
its
own
character
pours
brown
wood
like
in
color
with
a
slight
crimson
hue
and
a
thin
fizzy
off
white
head
smell
has
some
tart
fruity
aromas
of
brown
sugar
apple
cider
vinegar
cherries
plums
currents
and
an
acidic
finish
taste
has
a
dominant
cherry
acidic
tartness
forward
with
sticky
sweet
malt
backbone
in
the
mid
section
and
more
plum
and
prune
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
tart
sticky
acidic
moderately
carbonated
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
semi
tannic
finish
not
exactly
to
style
but
a
good
sour
bomb
lactic
lightly
acetic
bready
caramel
malt
tart
cherry
very
light
oak
tannin
lemon
peel
on
finish
i
love
flanders
but
this
just
fell
short
of
what
i
consider
a
true
flanders
there
was
a
weird
off
twangmetallic
taste
to
it
that
didnt
do
it
for
me
tart
cherry
on
the
front
it
ends
short
o
unlike
many
classic
flanders
reds
destihls
wild
sour
really
amps
up
the
lactic
sourness
which
im
aok
with
the
malt
profile
and
fruit
notes
are
still
there
as
is
the
lingering
though
much
more
subdued
sweetness
on
the
finish
i
much
prefer
this
beer
on
tap
as
opposed
to
the
can
no
knock
on
cans
but
its
damn
good
either
way
flavor
dies
on
the
finish
not
oakaged
and
no
trace
of
any
lacto
an
authentic
flanders
red
would
have
these
characteristics
really
interesting
beer
i
doubt
the
brewers
intended
it
to
have
that
kraut
undercurrent
but
its
there
its
subtle
enough
to
not
be
a
turnoff
but
i
cant
really
call
it
a
plus
either
kind
of
a
bonus
feature
that
made
this
a
fun
one
to
figure
out
tastes
essentially
like
their
gose
which
is
awesome
with
some
darker
malts
not
really
anything
in
the
vain
of
a
flanders
red
a
perfectly
fine
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
at
that
but
it
doesnt
really
bring
one
back
to
other
more
classic
takes
on
the
style
not
sure
if
we
had
a
bad
batch
but
flavor
was
horrible
looked
and
smelled
like
a
typical
flanders
but
taste
was
off
the
taste
and
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
where
it
really
fell
apart
for
me
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
a
flanders
can
only
be
achieved
successfully
in
my
mind
by
blending
young
and
old
beer
together
and
i
cant
imagine
they
did
that
with
this
beer
what
appears
to
have
happened
is
a
nonbarreled
aged
flanders
style
red
released
to
the
public
in
an
unblended
version
that
is
thin
watery
and
lacking
the
desirable
complex
flavor
typically
associated
to
a
flanders
red
and
instead
finishs
sweet
and
like
candied
apples
due
to
possible
underattenuation
and
oxidation
it
doesnt
appear
to
have
brett
or
be
barrel
aged
and
it
certainly
isnt
an
outstanding
example
of
a
flanders
red
final
score
3
65
not
the
best
interpretation
of
a
flanders
red
but
definitely
good
for
the
price
point
not
really
my
style
perhaps
destihl
brewery
flanders
red
45
overall
here
gose
nothing
was
a
pickle
salt
and
brine
bomb
the
flanders
red
seems
like
it
has
a
similar
flavor
profile
to
it
i
really
am
pretty
disappointed
that
this
wasnt
better
because
i
would
love
an
affordable
canned
sour
beer
that
is
readily
available
to
be
a
real
situation
destihl
wild
sour
series
is
now
02
in
the
canned
sour
line
up
this
is
nothing
close
to
a
flander
red
style
sour
ale
buyer
beware
excellent
d
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
plum
not
too
sour
at
all
this
is
a
fullflavored
sour
ale
that
strikes
a
good
balance
between
fruitiness
and
sourness
many
of
the
traditional
flagship
flanders
reds
tend
to
be
a
little
too
sour
and
onedimensional
for
my
tastes
so
this
was
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
drinkability
is
good
a
restrained
flanders
red
with
all
the
key
characteristics
and
value
price
to
boot
drink
its
okay
just
seemed
like
a
miss
after
having
some
of
the
best
in
the
class
with
gilgamesh
just
dominating
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
downtown
san
diego
location
not
bad
at
first
but
doesnt
offer
much
pleasure
after
a
few
sips
an
average
and
uninspired
flanders
red
but
there
will
usually
be
better
options
available
o
the
vinegar
flavor
was
a
bit
too
abrasive
and
the
amount
of
sweetness
was
a
bit
odd
ruby
mahogony
with
thin
egg
shell
head
nose
is
sweet
candied
dark
fruits
and
sour
notes
a
bit
of

vanilla
taste
is
soft
sour
cherries
vanilla
light
molasses
supplicationesque
very
very
slightly
acidic
mouthfeel
is
great
not
overcarbonated
keeps
smooth
to
match
the
vanilla
character
overall
i
am
very
impressed
i
havent
a
clue
how
this
has
such
a
low
score
overall
a
better
than
expected
flanders
red
from
karl
strauss
recommended
poured
ontap
in
downtown
san
diego
at
the
columbia
street
brewpub
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
poured
a
dark
copperbrown
cloudy
coloring
there
was
a
ring
of
filmy
head
on
the
beer
the
beer
smelled
like
spilled
dried
beer
with
overtones
of
sour
malts
the
beer
tastes
are
middle
of
the
tongue
sour
malts
all
the
way
brutal
sour
the
sour
notes
are
similar
to
those
of
a
cider
the
sourness
actually
hits
right
in
the
tmj
joint
of
the
jaw
not
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
do
not
justify
the
wrecking
ball
effect
the
beer
has
on
your
mouth
and
tastebuds
again
im
happy
karl
is
making
this
definitely
try
it
keep
it
up
karl
it
may
miss
the
original
styles
mark
a
bit
but
nowadayswith
so
many
style
representations
from
so
many
different
brewers
what
doesnt
o
overall
a
nice
flanders
much
better
than
their
blonde
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
some
brett
to
it
and
nice
caramel
and
fruit
and
super
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
o
the
main
problem
here
is
the
lack
of
body
it
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
classic
bock
but
without
the
texture
it
struggles
somewhat
and
the
pleasant
array
of
flavours
is
not
quite
enough
to
save
this
drop
despite
such
a
major
flaw
its
impossible
to
discount
the
charisma
in
the
aroma
and
flavour
dont
really
know
what
this
is
trying
to
be
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
flanders
red
ale
to
me
but
as
an
8
dubbel
it
would
be
absolutely
stellar
pours
a
clouded
brown
with
ruby
hues
and
a
thick
pinkish
head
nose
is
cherries
leaf
tones
and
apples
flavor
is
fairly
earthy
but
not
powerfully
so
mild
cherry
tones
like
a
mild
flanders
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
carbonation
is
standard
id
say
an
easy
drinker
with
a
mild
flanders
edge
nice
enough
dcrisp
light
refreshing
this
brew
would
be
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
lively
dry
fruity
notes
are
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
with
a
definite
pucker
of
the
lips
present
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
probably
an
average
belgian
ale
all
in
all
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
reddish
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
sour
notes
with
some
oak
notes
taste
is
also
a
light
mix
between
some
oak
and
some
sourness
with
some
light
vinous
notes
body
is
average
for
the
style
with
some
good
carbonation
this
beer
really
reminded
me
of
the
classic
rodenbach
and
would
be
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
all
in
all
a
really
pleasent
drink
and
if
i
get
the
chance
to
taste
it
again
i
hope
itll
be
in
front
of
a
great
piece
of
steak
drinkability
despite
the
name
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
style
red
flandres
semi
unclear
taste
like
a
bad
homebrew
experiment
not
sure
why
this
was
willingly
released
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
muddled
cloudy
opaque
reddishbrown
color
with
no
trace
of
head
whatsoever
a
subtle
nose
with
tart
cherry
highlights
the
beer
has
a
tangy
sour
backbone
of
white
grape
and
cherry
with
a
slight
roasting
overall
the
aftertaste
is
puckering
bitter
with
a
subtle
tartness
a
dry
astringent
finish
at
the
end
more
mild
than
other
flanders
style
brews
decent
and
would
make
a
good
starter
for
someone
new
to
the
world
of
sours
o
pretty
bad
beer
although
dont
think
i
hated
it
as
much
as
everyone
else
who
was
drinking
it
that
said
wont
drink
it
again
o
metallic
fake
and
cherry
koolaid
thats
pretty
much
how
id
sum
this
one
up
dont
try
it
even
if
your
buddy
has
it
on
his
wants
and
another
friend
brings
it
bad
bad
tick
d
wow
this
was
terrible
upon
perusing
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
there
is
somewhat
extreme
batch
variation
unfortunately
my
experience
was
largely
in
line
with
reviews
by
tayner
cedromar
and
pebkac
id
consider
trying
again
ontap
at
the
brewpub
but
another
bottle
would
frighten
me
d
i
could
probably
finish
off
the
whole
growler
of
this
in
a
sitting
and
not
have
to
worry
about
palate
fatigue
good
flavors
and
a
decent
sour
kick
make
this
a
solid
offering
not
as
good
as
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
but
still
a
good
interpretation
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
i
guess
its
admittedly
difficult
to
think
of
it
separately
from
the
rest
of
the
beers
characteristics
i
am
going
to
try
to
choke
this
one
down
the
beer
pours
a
copper
to
reddish
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
slightly
tart
blackberry
or
raspberry
kind
of
the
taste
is
pretty
good
its
not
a
funky
sour
like
with
wild
ales
its
more
of
an
acidic
sour
like
somebody
just
squeezed
a
lemon
into
a
glass
of
beer
and
handed
it
to
you
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
puckering
but
not
crazy
sour
the
drinkablility
is
high
as
there
was
nothing
displeasing
and
i
like
lemon
sourness
d
im
not
crazy
about
this
one
this
was
a
very
drinkable
flanders
not
too
sweet
not
too
tart
just
right
deep
rubycopper
pour
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
funky
musty
fruity
aroma
green
apples
sour
raspberries
vinegar
and
funky
notes
all
combine
into
a
big
complex
flavor
very
funky
and
sour
finish
flavor
and
aroma
really
open
up
as
the
beer
warms
up
moderate
carbonation
with
a
dry
clean
finish
had
this
both
on
tap
and
from
a
bottle
truly
enjoy
this
beer
drink
is
decent
but
not
great
with
some
tart
sour
flavors
some
light
dry
bready
funk
and
no
real
booze
so
it
goes
down
well
overall
a
nice
flanders
red
that
is
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
not
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
style
worth
getting
a
couple
glasses
of
though
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
oak
along
with
cherry
and
some
mild
malt
good
acetic
character
and
some
definite
sourness
the
taste
is
cherries
oak
slight
malt
as
well
as
lactic
and
acetic
sourness
good
feel
and
nice
sour
character
drinks
fairly
well
but
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
a
very
fine
head
that
leaves
some
broken
lacing
smells
clean
coppery
tart
the
taste
is
unusually
toasty
for
the
style
but
i
like
it
very
sour
quite
metallic
and
even
a
bit
dusty
in
the
end
in
short
quite
like
a
flanders
red
a
bit
tannic
and
puckery
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
little
too
sharp
to
be
perfectly
drinkable
nice
for
a
change
though
d
this
is
a
rustic
brew
not
terribly
complex
but
if
you
want
a
sour
sour
this
will
do
the
trick
over
all
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
this
was
a
very
refreshing
treat
with
great
drinkability
d
just
ok
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
seek
this
one
out
again
but
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
we
also
had
the
cascade
kriek
that
blew
this
out
of
the
water
color
is
relatively
clear
brownish
red
and
a
hard
pour
produces
a
quickly
fading
foamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
tart
cherries
yeasty
malty
vinegary
and
slightly
oaky
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
turns
from
a
slightly
acidic
sharp
vinegar
taste
to
a
fairly
sweet
and
mild
tart
vinegar
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
results
in
a
lingering
vinegar
like
taste
occasionally
there
are
moments
of
very
enjoyable
tart
cherry
and
sour
in
the
taste
but
most
of
the
time
it
is
a
slightly
off
clash
of
vinegar
flavors
and
not
a
great
example
of
a
flanders
red
j
d
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
that
is
probably
a
good
thing
the
flavor
was
decent
for
the
most
part
but
that
slight
taint
of
metal
was
a
bit
offputting
i
dont
know
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
however
i
just
loved
drinking
this
served
from
a
chilled
growler
that
was
filled
6
days
prior
the
beer
was
brown
with
a
hint
of
orange
there
wasnt
much
head
the
aroma
was
both
sweet
and
sour
i
picked
up
some
cherry
musty
yeast
and
sour
funk
the
taste
is
of
sour
cherries
somewhere
between
a
kriek
lambic
and
a
cough
drop
is
the
flanders
red
i
think
i
can
taste
a
hint
of
sour
apple
in
addition
to
the
cherry
flavors
and
maybe
some
palelight
malts
there
is
a
puckering
aftertaste
but
also
some
sugar
as
well
i
find
it
to
be
very
tasty
it
has
a
medium
body
and
not
much
carbonation
this
could
be
because
of
the
age
of
the
growler
there
is
a
good
lingering
tingle
from
the
sourness
i
think
its
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
sour
beer
i
dont
think
the
puckering
reaction
will
get
old
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
d
i
liked
this
but
it
still
had
plenty
of
yeast
and
some
wierdness
that
wasnt
pleasant
and
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
i
consider
it
good
but
not
my
first
choice
in
flemish
reds
drinkable
and
pretty
sour
fits
the
style
w
good
fruity
accents
i
easily
enjoyed
this
more
than
ktg
which
is
why
im
glad
i
bought
a
growler
when
i
had
the
chance
22oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
brewery
on
22810
served
in
my
allagash
chalice
at
49
degrees
poured
a
semitranslucent
plum
color
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
cap
that
dissipates
into
nothing
no
lacing
the
sides
of
the
glass
were
coated
with
clusters
of
tiny
bubbles
all
along
the
sides
nose
reveals
sour
cherries
a
little
bit
of
wood
and
a
corkyearthy
character
weird
for
a
capped
beer
taste
consistent
with
nose
quite
a
bit
of
acidity
in
the
mix
but
tartness
comes
across
as
somewhat
watered
down
also
a
faint
but
strange
residual
aftertaste
somewhere
between
bready
and
wet
cardboard
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
bodied
with
a
lively
carbonation
level
and
an
astringency
that
starts
at
the
tongue
stimulating
the
salivary
glands
along
the
cheeks
and
culminating
in
a
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
really
nice
flanders
red
i
had
it
on
draft
and
didnt
get
the
weird
aftertaste
nonetheless
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
at
the
brewpub
and
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
d
im
glad
i
tried
it
not
my
favorite
flanders
for
sure
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
very
nice
midlevel
sour
that
is
more
complex
than
others
i
have
had
in
the
style
amazing
the
mouthfeel
is
light
the
beer
is
more
carbonated
than
others
of
the
style
but
the
increased
carbonation
adds
to
the
flavor
profile
nicely
the
beer
is
low
alcohol
with
very
balanced
flavors
and
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
a
beer
that
i
order
several
pints
of
when
sitting
at
the
bar
and
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
this
bomber
drinkability
is
key
to
this
drink
its
one
of
the
most
sessionable
sours
ive
had
that
still
tastes
good
its
not
extreme
and
you
could
easily
finish
a
growler
yourself
overall
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
and
it
was
a
very
generous
extra
however
on
the
whole
i
find
it
to
be
a
not
terribly
offensive
but
poor
example
of
the
style
drinkability
no
alcohol
to
worry
about
here
but
i
find
the
green
apple
tartness
a
bit
much
after
some
time
sipping
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
cider
hey
i
hear
you
laughing
still
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
it
could
use
some
work
not
really
a
flanders
just
an
awkward
sour
brown
as
it
stands
this
is
quite
a
unique
style
and
im
glad
to
see
an
american
brewpub
tackle
it
the
intense
tartness
and
viscous
feel
held
this
back
a
bit
for
me
but
thats
more
style
related
than
anything
solid
stuff
here
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
of
bite
up
front
light
bit
syrupy
overall
this
was
easily
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
i
have
had
recently
really
very
light
and
very
tart
just
amazing
this
one
should
get
some
more
hype
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
not
my
favorite
the
metallic
taste
really
limits
the
drinkability
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
treat
of
a
flanders
red
the
nose
is
excellent
i
would
love
to
read
a
little
about
what
went
into
this
brew
thanks
for
the
bottle
heath
it
was
goodness
portsmouth
does
ris
better
than
it
does
flanders
red
d
the
beer
is
no
doubt
slightly
above
average
every
counterpart
comes
together
to
make
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
brew
my
mind
runs
off
as
i
write
this
review
and
i
think
of
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
drinking
pints
of
this
while
sitting
off
near
the
riverfront
this
beer
could
definitely
be
exceptional
given
the
right
time
and
place
d
thanks
joepais
for
this
treat
the
process
might
not
be
genuine
but
the
heartburn
sure
is
thanks
drdogbeer
for
the
opportunity
this
one
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
sadly
i
have
a
second
bottle
that
i
will
never
drink
and
i
will
feel
bad
if
i
send
it
as
an
extra
although
who
knows
someone
else
might
like
it
overall
a
very
nice
beer
everything
was
spot
on
except
for
the
finish
as
stated
above
im
going
to
say
that
my
beer
was
a
fluke
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
where
this
one
goes
in
the
cellar
a
brownred
color
more
brown
than
red
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
sour
fruity
aroma
sweet
fruit
taste
up
front
with
a
sour
blast
following
you
can
really
feel
this
in
your
salivary
glands
nice
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
overall
tastes
like
a
tweaked
version
of
their
oud
bruin
from
last
year
which
to
me
was
much
more
sour
and
less
drinkable
though
i
did
like
it
good
beer
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
lot
a
different
take
on
the
style
almost
none
of
the
vinegar
side
sour
in
it
much
more
funk
than
anything
else
but
its
also
thick
and
sort
of
sweet
with
a
curious
finish
murky
brick
red
in
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
it
looks
the
part
for
sure
the
nose
on
it
has
a
little
pucker
but
more
woody
weirdness
than
acidity
the
flavor
is
complex
showing
the
best
of
the
red
malts
the
wood
barrels
and
dried
fruit
notes
ranging
from
cherry
to
cranberry
the
finish
is
what
makes
this
different
i
think
instead
of
thinning
body
and
climaxing
acidity
it
sort
of
mellows
on
the
sour
front
moves
into
a
sweet
nutty
profile
and
the
weight
of
the
body
sets
in
its
thick
beer
its
cool
and
different
in
the
style
i
get
almond
and
even
coconut
in
there
late
and
the
decent
carbonation
barley
cuts
the
density
a
pleasing
beverage
nice
and
low
in
abv
and
really
unique
in
the
way
it
concludes
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
tart
acidity
and
slight
acetic
vinegar
followed
by
sweet
vinous
fruit
and
slightly
roasted
dark
malt
some
dryness
possibly
from
the
oak
meshes
with
acetic
acid
earthy
funk
and
dry
bretty
bugs
the
acidity
and
funk
are
countered
by
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
subtle
malt
flavors
hints
of
raspberry
sour
cherry
grape
and
plum
compliment
the
acetic
quality
while
providing
some
needed
balance
to
the
dry
oak
and
musty
funk
nicely
balanced
with
good
sourness
and
subtle
funk
easy
to
drink
with
little
to
no
harshness
i
havent
had
this
beer
fresh
but
it
has
held
up
nicely
and
is
better
than
some
of
the
other
reviewsindicate
medium
body
lowish
carbonation
level
overall
a
nice
attempt
at
the
style
and
quite
easy
to
drink
o
this
flanders
red
sits
in
a
limbo
between
puckering
tartness
and
fruity
sweetness
the
result
is
rather
mild
and
falls
short
of
many
other
in
the
style
pours
a
dark
murky
amber
red
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
foamy
off
white
head
strong
potent
aroma
of
cherries
vinegar
oak
mild
brett
dark
fruit
and
slight
funk
tart
cherry
throughout
the
flavor
with
an
oak
presence
in
the
front
of
the
palate
and
dry
vinegar
sourness
through
the
finish
with
some
vanilla
slightly
thicker
than
expected
with
light
carbonation
not
a
great
flanders
but
a
pleasant
treat
that
shows
up
on
tap
at
iron
hill
more
often
than
their
other
sours
or
ba
experiments
o
i
think
that
id
have
to
go
b
on
this
one
compared
to
others
in
the
style
that
i
have
had
not
a
lot
but
the
good
ones
this
doesnt
stack
up
good
stab
though
love
the
local
brewery
and
the
majority
of
their
brews
o
while
i
will
admit
im
not
an
expert
on
the
style
i
have
had
a
few
flemish
reds
and
imo
this
one
does
not
make
the
mark
the
sourness
is
simultaneously
subdued
and
not
substantial
enough
while
being
mildly
offensive
and
dirty
tasting
according
to
the
silvermarker
scrawl
on
the
label
this
is
bottle
37
of
question
mark
and
its
dated
92510
theres
more
but
i
cant
make
it
out
anyway
the
stuff
inside
pours
a
mostly
clear
russetgarnet
topped
by
a
shortlived
finger
of
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
cherry
light
vinegar
light
pomegranate
brown
sugar
and
a
backbone
of
sweet
caramel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
caramel
light
cranberry
tart
malt
vinegar
light
tomato
and
a
touch
of
swiss
cheese
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sticky
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
flemish
red
and
a
nice
drinker
as
well
this
is
one
i
could
have
a
field
day
with
now
if
they
would
release
it
annually
than
ill
be
sitting
pretty
while
this
was
certainly
an
easy
drinking
and
approachable
take
on
a
flemish
red
it
seemed
like
the
depth
of
flavor
that
they
were
shooting
for
with
this
just
seemed
to
struggle
to
come
out
at
times
this
was
maybe
a
bit
too
rich
with
the
fruity
tartness
which
helped
cover
up
some
of
the
little
nuances
that
i
think
would
have
taken
this
to
the
next
level
still
this
is
a
good
one
to
introduce
the
style
to
somebody
with
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
left
me
wanting
a
bit
more
i
think
a
bit
of
time
in
the
bottle
would
do
this
one
wonders
i
hope
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
d
its
a
pretty
enjoyable
and
easytodrink
flanders
red
there
are
some
minor
issues
particularly
the
aftertaste
but
allinall
its
an
aboveaverage
take
on
the
style
id
rather
have
a
la
folie
but
that
didnt
prevent
me
from
going
for
multiple
refills
of
this
one
this
is
a
pretty
good
flanders
red
fairly
balanced
with
the
barrel
characteristics
and
cherries
taking
center
stage
the
wonderful
red
fruit
notes
are
up
front
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
tangy
cherry
and
just
enough
tart
cranberry
with
slight
acidic
and
gently
spicy
taste
with
moderately
high
vanilla
from
the
oak
able
to
blend
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
hops
which
are
spot
on
i
really
enjoyed
this
so
tasty
and
was
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
had
next
to
ommegang
rouge
kudos
paul
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
this
one
needs
some
work
d
not
a
bad
flanders
red
here
though
not
one
of
my
favorite
bottle
releases
from
iron
hill
still
im
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
retired
beer
given
the
fact
that
this
wasnt
too
puckering
of
a
sour
and
the
flavors
were
all
on
point
this
was
a
fairly
good
drinking
example
of
the
style
easily
drinkable
good
bright
flavors
its
not
exceptional
and
it
tastes
more
like
a
flanders
oud
bruin
to
me
than
a
red
but
its
balanced
and
pretty
tasty
taste
is
a
bit
vinegery
but
definitely
has
that
flanders
red
taste
to
it
some
nice
tart
cherry
but
not
much
else
disappointing
i
think
more
carbonation
would
help
the
flavor
profile
but
as
it
is
there
just
isnt
much
to
it
easy
to
drink
despite
the
complaints
though
on
tap
at
the
north
wales
location
not
sure
where
it
was
brewed
not
sure
if
this
entry
refers
to
the
flanders
red
as
indicated
on
the
iron
hill
menu
pleasant
good
sour
cherry
tones
more
complex
and
almost
creamy
not
as
sharply
sour
as
most
but
not
as
fruity
as
the
kriek
loved
it
slightly
mad
at
the
lose
of
one
of
my
nice
tasting
glasses
in
the
process
of
this
beer
however
that
happen
and
once
the
carbonation
calms
a
bit
this
is
an
enjoyable
flemish
ale
quite
a
bit
of
acidy
but
also
high
on
the
sweetness
so
it
balances
well
lots
of
character
very
refreshing
with
the
tartness
smooth
bodied
and
a
nice
balance
between
the
yeast
and
the
malt
really
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
overall
really

rough
and
vinegary
dark

its

id
say
its
flanders
red
for
those
which
are
not
accustomed

sweet

sour

savory

nicely
carbonated
sherry
vinegar
and

as

as
flemish
reds
go
this
is
pretty
far
down
my
list
but
its
still
drinkable
and
has
some
good
flavors
it
just
lacks
the

excellent
this
was
tasty
not
one
of
the
extremely
sour
flanders
reds
but
a
bit
sweeter
very
nice
flemish
sour
auburn
in
color
with
a
little
bit
of
an
effervescent
tan
head
smells
of
cherries
oak
and
rubber

the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
expected
there
is
plenty
of
dark
cherry
acetic
acid
a
bit
of
oak
a
little
bit
of
maraschino
cherries
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
quality

of
the
sweetness
rubber

is
good
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
still
quite
enjoyable
o
mellow

that
is
solid
smooth
i
will
purchase
again
yum
hobo
chang
ba
mild
flanders
red
ale
refreshing
and
pleasant
to
drink
not
at
par
of
duchesse
and
rodenbach
a
bit
sweet
a
less
funky
acid
but
still
pretty
decent
and
easy
to
drink
good
bridge
to
these
territories
every
once
in
a
while
you
try
a
beer
and
you
know
you
may
have
to
try
it
again
sometime
to
see
if
your
first
experience
was
a
fluke
this
beer
was
like
that
because
i
cant
possibly
imagine
that
it
was
intended
to
taste
like
this
it
had
to
have
been
a
beer
that
went
bad
during
the
bottling
process
during
shipping
to
the
u
s
or
some
infernal
combination
of
the
aforementioned
scenarios
compounded
by
a
disgruntled
employee
of
the
brewery
taking
a
piss
in
the
batch
first
of
all
im
pretty
sure
its
not
supposed
to
smell
like
sour
vinegar
and
taste
pretty
much
the
same
out
of
stubbornness
i
continued
to
force
it
down
and
finally
gave
up
at
the
halfway
point
before
i
poured
it
down
the
sink
it
only
got
worse
from
there
because
the
next
24
hours
can
only
be
described
as
something
akin
to
galloping
dysentery
im
not
kidding
or
trying
to
be
clever
this
beer
truly
made
me
sick
i
dont
know
maybe
explosive
diarrhea
is
some
trendy
new
experience
with
imports
and
im
just
too
much
of
an
uncultured
barbarian
to
appreciate
the
finer
nuances
of
such
a
gift
some
day
i
may
try
another
but
for
the
moment
this
brewery
and
the
vendor
i
bought
it
from
owe
me
a
serious
apology
beautiful
burgundy
red
colour
with
alost
no
foam
at
all
nice
balance
between
the
sourness
of
a
flemish
red
and
a
sweet
fruitiness
cherry
strawberry
almost
tastes
like
a
lambic
beer
it
is
much
fruitier
than
other
flemish
red
i
have
drank
so
far
first
time
i
drank
this
one
but
i
love
it
o
this
wont
wow
you
but
its
a
session
able
fob
pours
super
dark
red
with
a
small
head
hints
of
tart
black
cherry
and
vinegar
on
the
nose
beautiful
flavor
of
black
cherries
nice
tartness
and
clean
finish
very
easy
drinking
and
quite
yummy
carbonation
makes
it
feel
light
on
the
palate
my
second
from
verhaeghe
and
have
been
impressed
by
both
but
this
one
is
better
than
the
kriek
for
me
o
very
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
and
not
overly
tartsour
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
beer
for
novices
to
the
flanders
red
ale
style
to
try
out
o
this
is
my
least
favorite
flanders
so
far
very
dull
and
unimpressive
for
the
style
less
fruity
than
the
nose
might
indicate
some
sweet
cherry
flavor
at
the
beginning
which
transforms
into
a
sour
finish
light
cinammon
flavor
and
again
wine
taste
body
is
light
to
medium
overall
an
nice
refreshing
beer
mouthfeel
nice
tartness
and
bubbles
on
the
mouth
to
add
complexity
3c
average
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
prefer
these
beers
with
a
little
more
acidity
especially
on
the
finish
this
one
exits
down
your
throat
on
more
of
a
sweet
note
still
it
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
tartness
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
fruit
and
slight
sour
notes
fits
the
style
of
a
flanders
red
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
sour
notes
slight
fruit
hint
of
yeast
and
hint
of
hops
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
blend
a
very
interesting
beer
it
pours
a
clear
medium
shade
of
brown
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
comprised
of
pretty
large
bubbles
it
smells
a
lot
darker
than
it
looks
plenty
of
roast
on
the
malts
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
some
definite
sour
vibes
the
flavor
is
exactly
that
sweet
at
first
sour
in
the
finish
the
sweet
is
complex
brown
sugar
or
molasses
with
something
a
little
floral
maybe
honey
the
sour
is
more
vinegar
than
brett
but
isnt
offputting
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
good
lighter
than
it
looks
this
time
with
only
about
a
medium
body
and
effervescent
carbonation
overall
a
nice
flanders
style
brew
but
probably
wont
pay
6
bucks
for
a
bottle
again
overall
pretty
solid
flanders
red
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
good
vichtenaarpours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
plentiful
ruby
highlights
about
two
fingers
or
so
of
off
white
foam
crown
the
beer
head
retention
is
fairly
solid
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
left
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
healthy
proportion
of
sweet
cherrydark
fruits
offset
only
by
a
little
bit
of
a
tart
aroma
the
flavor
profile
is
again
dominated
by
sweet
cherries
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
sour
presence
as
well
and
a
slight
oaky
note
thats
barely
perceptible
all
in
all
the
taste
somewhat
reminds
me
of
a
cherry
cola
which
isnt
necessarily
what
im
looking
for
for
this
style
its
all
fruit
and
artificial
sweetness
with
very
little
acidity
or
wood
notes
to
balance
things
out
the
body
was
a
little
bit
full
and
the
carbonation
a
little
bit
dull
but
neither
were
too
far
off
the
mark
i
guess
i
was
spoiled
with
my
first
flanders
red
being
from
rodenbach
in
comparison
vichtenaar
tastes
like
its
been
backsweetened
and
it
has
none
of
the
depth
or
complexity
of
the
best
versions
of
the
style
o
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
of
sour
dark
fruit
and
pears
dominate
the
flavour
profile
which
makes
it
quite
drinkable
carbonation
is
lively
and
nippy
while
not
biting
but
does
make
it
both
crisp
and
smooth
o
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
there
are
better
ones
out
there
in
my
opinion
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
will
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
total
ambush
beer
and
i
am
really
enjoying
it
wanted
to
have
tasted
this
flanders
red
for
awhile
ill
know
to
decant
next
time
a
tasty
and
almost
fulfilling
example
certainly
worth
a
revisit

friends
okay
ill
come
right
out
and
say
it
if
youre
a
big
sour
fan
this
will
not
be
for
you
if
you
are
looking
for
a
stepping
stone
step
right
on
this
one
its
a
gateway
flemish
redbrown
but
if
youve
already
got
the
bug
you
can
skip
this
one
pours
a
ruby
color
smell
is
a
little
like
vinegar
but
with
some
sweetness
taste
is
like
a
red
vinegar
but
with
sweetness
and
malt
really
wonder
how
they
get
it
that
close
to
vinegar
but
does
not
go
over
the
top
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
it
has
become
a
new
favorite
when
i
am
eating
spicy
foods
i
am
a
fan
and
i
really
do
not
like
sour
beers
overall
impression
a
very
nice
flanders
red
there
was
never
too
much
sourness
or
cherry
flavor
and
so
this
one
was
easy
drinking
and
i
could
definitely
present
this
one
to
anyone
of
my
friends
i
could
have
had
another
one
to
see
if
there
was
any
difference
in
complexity
or
flavors
go
for
it
if
in
stores
i
would
like
to
see
how
much
this
one
really
costs
at
the
retail
price
oplug
your
nose
and
drink
its
okay
but
not
good
enough
to
justify
the
price
tag
the
funny
thing
is
i
chose
this
beer
because
it
was
the
cheapest
sour
i
could
find
at
the
bar
i
was
at
taught
me
a
lesson
to
not
save
money
it
becomes
more
and
more
simple
as
i
drink
it
not
enough
sourness
to
it
not
a
pain
to
finish
though
delicious
as
a
treat
by
itself
not
sure
id
serve
it
with
any
food
other
than
a
sweet
dessert
a
little
steep
at
8
a
bottle
but
then
again
i
ordered
it
at
a
bar
and
did
not
get
it
off
a
store
shelf
this
is
really
about
as
drinkable
as
one
of
these
beers
gets
it
has
all
the
right
qualities
and
while
it
could
use
more
of
a
sour
bite
the
way
it
is
makes
it
tasty
and
really
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
vichtenaar
may
not
be
the
best
interpretation
going
around
but
its
certainly
the
most
enjoyable
fra
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
o
a
mediocre
beer
although
i
cant
fairly
say
if
this
is
because
of
the
brew
itself
or
because
its
past
expiration
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
would
have
liked
to
see
the
sour
notes
picked
up
in
the
nose
more
developed
in
the
taste
next
time
im
craving
a
flemish
red
ill
probably
go
with
rodenbach
grand
cru
or
duchesse
de
bourgogne
instead
o
i
was
disappointed
to
discover
just
how
old
this
beer
was
hopefully
a
fresher
example
will
show
better
than
this
did
the
beer
is
ruby
and
brown
hued
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
leaves
virtually
no
lacing
the
aroma
sends
off
alarm
signals
upon
the
initial
whiff
sweet
cherries
alcohol
and
an
acetonelike
off
scent
the
flavor
is
equally
disappointing
no
lactic
sour
barrel
funk
notes
or
anything
pleasant
for
that
matter
the
beer
was
too
sweet
and
basically
a
mess
not
a
good
example
of
a
flanders
red
ale
a
style
of
which
i
am
particularly
fond
o
one
of
the
better
flanders
brews
ive
come
across
yet
unlike
the
duchess
this
brew
exhibits
a
harmonious
interaction
between
sweet
and
sour
with
each
complementing
the
others
characteristics
great
brew
o
overall
not
that
great
of
a
flanders
red
ale
the
nose
and
taste
are
way
too
sweet
and
neither
have
much
sourness
or
tartness
to
it
wouldnt
seek
out
again
overall
im
not
the
best
judge
of
this
style
but
its
certainly
better
than
other
versions
i
have
had
the
sweetness
is
just
barely
enough
without
becoming
overpowering
not
overly
sour
just
tart
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
flanders
red
that
held
up
to
the
age
beautifully
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
but
still
very
tart
and
a
bit
sour
tasty
stuff
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
has
a
light
bit
of
red
tint
to
it
the
nose
is
really
strange
theres
some
acetic
acid
and
oak
along
with
a
really
creamy
character
while
appropriate
its
too
heavy
and
goes
off
in
the
wrong
direction
reminding
me
a
bit
of
a
tequila
creaminess
flavor
has
the
same
issues
oak
and
a
bit
of
cherry
but
then
theres
an
off
creamy
character
to
it
no
real
malt
or
oak
influence
and
the
sourness
is
kept
very
small
medium
body
really
a
strange
beer
and
not
one
that
i
particularly
enjoyed
one
of
the
first
flemish
reds
i
had
ever
tried
this
beer
was
a
very
nice
ruby
red
color
which
was
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweeter
side
and
not
as
sour
as
expected
the
oak
aging
really
dominates
the
finish
of
the
beer
to
me
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
overall
its
pretty
average
a
nice
tartness
but
a
lack
of
any
real
sour
elements
that
you
should
be
looking
for
in
a
fra
imo
worth
a
try
anyways
pretty
easy
to
drink
very
inricate
drinkability
pretty
good
definitely
worth
choosing
over
duchesse
de
bourgogne
the
brewerys
better
known
flanders
red
d
the
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
flavors
in
the
taste
makes
this
beer
very
easy
to
consume
not
the
most
complex
example
of
the
style
ive
had
but
very
enjoyable
a
good
everyday
flanders
red
easy
drinker
d
the
highly
sweet
aftertaste
is
keeping
me
from
wanting
more
the
vinegar
has
an
unusual
tinge
to
it
which
will
also
keep
me
from
reaching
for
more
d
i
found
this
a
hair
mellow
for
a
flemish
but
enjoyed
nonetheless
need
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
and
age
em
to
see
if
the
tart
grows
on
me
worth
a
go
ahead
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
reddishbrown
similar
to
tea
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
sour
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
excellent
really
glad
that
ed
at
the
community
tap
suggested
that
i
give
this
one
a
little
while
back
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
good
aroma
without
doubt
actually
mine
and
my
buddies
second
favorite
brew
out
of
all
the
sours
we
had
this
past
weekend
a
must
try
for
any
sour
fan
out
there
without
a
doubt
decent
carbonation
and
body
overall
this
is
ok
but
not
worth
the
5
for
an
11
2oz
bottle
this
brew
reminds
me
of
russian
river
consecration
but
in
a
much
much
milder
form
mouthfeel
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
carbonation
is
mediumtohigh
gentle
on
the
palate
and
refreshing
but
still
fullflavored
i
could
drink
this
any
time
of
the
day
probably
a
great
breakfast
beer
with
omelette
and
sausage
or
something
need
more
d
great
clean
depth
fresh
and
fruity
crisp
with
a
tart
drying
finish
fantastic
beer
mouthfeel
seems
perfect
for
this
beer
and
seems
to
change
in
the
mouth
thin
initially
than
begins
to
feel
like
it
coats
the
mouth
only
to
be
cleansed
by
the
sour
finish
that
creates
a
lingering
burn
on
the
tongue
this
is
an
excellently
flavored
dessert
beer
bottle
3
99
for
a
11
2oz
bottle
best
before
190910
pours
a
nice
looking
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
sour
fruit
cherries
and
raisins
very
sweet
me
thinks
upon
the
first
sip
mildly
sour
and
tart
and
ends
rather
sugary
minimal
aftertaste
of
alcohol
like
cough
syrup
medium
mouthfeel
thought
it
would
be
a
little
lighter
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
very
sour
nor
did
it
have
a
very
strong
oak
taste
for
being
lagered
for
8
months
d
if
vinegar
is
your
thing
then
this
bottle
was
for
you
pretty
sure
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
as
i
have
had
this
style
before
and
none
were
nearly
as
vinegary
one
has
to
have
the
taste
buds
for
the
style
of
beer
not
a
beer
for
the
non
belgain
yeast
and
oak
aged
red
wine
lover
there
will
always
be
a
sweet
spot
in
my
heart
for
this
beer
as
its
one
that
i
cracked
my
tooth
on
in
the
world
of
better
beer
with
that
said
there
is
better
out
there
style
wise
its
low
abv
but
the
taste
does
not
make
me
want
top
grab
a
bottle
any
time
soon
cannot
believe
i
am
just
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
beautiful
tawny
pour
with
a
nice
beige
head
beutiful
presentation
in
my
chouffe
tulip
malty
sweet
sour
smell
with
a
subdued
balsamic
taste
is
of
butterscotch
with
just
enough
of
that
tart
balsamic
to
prevent
it
getting
too
sweet
light
carbonation
very
smooth
very
drinkable
possibly
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
pours
a
very
nice
dark
redbrown
chestnut
color
with
a
great
2
finger
beige
head
with
solid
clinging
lacing
smell
is
of
a
kriek
tart
cherries
and
some
musty
oak
with
some
sour
patch
vinegar
its
funky
and
musty
taste
is
the
same
tart
sweet
cherries
hit
the
side
of
the
tongue
then
some
sour
patch
and
musty
oak
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
its
very
good
mouth
feel
is
full
and
hits
the
palette
all
over
the
taste
buds
from
sweet
to
sour
to
murky
and
musty
then
to
an
oak
finish
i
find
this
to
be
a
delicious
flanders
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
to
enjoy
its
a
sipper
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
overall
a
really
solid
ale
here
really
nicely
done
with
a
tremendous
bouquet
and
also
depth
of
flavor
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
any
day
this
is
a
decent
and
drinkable
flemish
red
ale
and
seems
a
reasonable
example
of
the
type
but
i
think
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
lacks
complexity
and
intensity
compared
to
something
like
rodenbach
similar
to
duchesse
de
bourgogne
as
i
would
expect
being
the
same
style
and
brewery
though
this
is
obviously
much
dryer
excellent
throughout
i
am
going
to
have
to
get
a
bottle
of
duchesse
to
try
side
by
side
with
this
highly
recommend
d
sweet
good
yummy
but
too
simple
a
chick
beer
d
drinkable
very
easy
going
down
surprisingly
refreshing
smooth
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
style
that
i
have
been
big
on
recently
so
i
would
like
more
but
could
see
how
one
would
be
enough
a
very
good
beer
notes
nice
sour
to
keep
around
and
its
high
within
the
style
but
makes
one
long
for
an
extended
complexity
and
a
shorter
sweet
range
d
a
solid
flanders
red
all
the
way
around
not
the
best
ive
had
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
and
one
i
would
welcome
in
the
future
opinion
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
i
really
like
the
duchesse
from
this
brewery
and
this
beer
is
no
slouch
by
comparison
this
one
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
duchesse
but
the
duchesse
is
really
about
the
only
other
beer
that
i
could
compare
this
to
if
you
like
flanders
and
sour
ales
like
i
do
you
will
respect
the
raw
intensity
of
like
a
rodenbach
but
this
beer
is
significantly
more
subtle
it
is
a
very
well
blended
beer
and
i
would
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
we
have
the
duchesse
in
texas
now
so
i
cant
complain
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
like
sours
or
not
you
wont
be
disappointed
it
was
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
refreshing
drinkability
ive
been
sneaking
a
few
of
these
into
the
movies
lately
awesome
two
of
my
greatest
passions
in
one
place
pours
a
very
deep
crimson
with
dark
brown
highlights
making
the
proceedings
even
darker
the
richlooking
head
plumes
to
about
a
finger
or
so
thick
but
dissipates
rather
quickly
settling
to
a
simmer
on
the
surface
the
nose
is
comprised
of
green
apples
pears
cranberries
and
cardamom
sour
yes
but
with
substance
behind
it
rather
than
sour
for
the
sake
of
sour
the
taste
takes
those
sour
fruit
notes
and
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
with
the
subtle
body
and
sweetness
of
the
malts
unfortunately
though
there
is
an
expectation
of
some
bite
some
climactic
punch
from
the
back
and
sides
of
the
tongue
but
this
never
comes
luckily
though
the
body
remains
in
the
medium
range
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
keeping
this
nice
brew
from
sinking
in
terms
of
drinkability
drinkability
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
the
malt
profile
was
a
little
too
high
and
the
sour
and
fruit
notes
didnt
come
out
as
much
as
i
wanted
there
are
a
lot
of
better
sours
out
there
to
try
i
like
their
duchesse
offering
more
this
was
a
sweet
style
flemish
brown
to
me
it
lacked
the
sour
that
i
would
like
to
have
in
this
style
but
the
taste
beyond
that
and
the
molasses
like
sweetness
were
very
nice
this
is
a
good
version
of
the
sweet
end
of
the
spectrum
of
this
style
i
would
try
it
again
drinkability
is
high
if
you
like
this
style
very
flavorful
but
digestible
and
lower
alcohol
in
fact
its
a
great
digestif
which
is
why
im
having
it
right
now
obviously
some
people
will
not
but
i
think
you
should
have
at
least
half
a
bottle
before
your
decide
the
burgundy
wine
of
belgium
for
sure
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
adequately
carbonated
d
pretty
average
too
much
flavor
to
drink
too
quickly
but
not
hiding
too
high
of
an
abv
drinkability
sweet
and
sour
sauce
that
is
beer
im
sure
older
versions
of
this
are
much
better
as
the
beer
sours
a
bit
more
and
loses
a
bit
of
that
sweet
edge
not
bad
but
either
more
time
is
needed
or
less
malt
probably
more
time
to
let
the
sour
develop
a
little
flat
overall
not
in
terms
of
carbonation
but
wow
factor
normal
european
brown
ale
notes
with
enough
puckering
sourness
to
lift
it
above
the
crowd
fruity
and
sensational
lemonlime
zestiness
up
front
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
doesnt
quite
hold
up
to
the
best
of
the
flanders
red
style
vichtenaar
is
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
and
ive
graded
it
as
such
but
its
never
going
to
be
a
style
i
love
the
gradual
build
up
of
vinegar
flavours
is
enjoyable
at
first
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
ive
had
enough
and
struggle
to
finish
if
only
this
stuff
was
available
in
half
bottles
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
not
very
drinkable
becuase
of
the
strongness
of
the
beverage
this
is
a
little
disappointing
drinkabliilty
is
great
subtle
and
easy
drinking
with
a
wonderfully
complex
character
and
a
very
tasty
profile
an
excellent
flemish
brew
cheers
a
great
example
of
flanders
red
but
perhaps
not
the
best
seems
like
fairly
high
carbonation
during
the
pour
lots
of
fluffy
tan
bubbles
with
a
faint
pink
tint
the
beer
is
a
ruddy
chestnut
colour
and
a
bit
translucent
great

fruity

sour
cherries
a

seemed

somewhat
after

sips
not
sure
if
its
the
beers
fault
or
my
palates
but
it
still
tastes
fine
just
not
as
crisp
on
the
tongue
medium
to
light
bodied
with
generous
carbonation
and
an
airy

pretty
good

whoa
ive
got
a

i
was
certainly
ready
for
another
but
alas
as
this
was
the
first
try
only
bought
the
single
this
went
down
exceptionally
easy
for
me
overall
a
terrific
beer
poured
a
brownish
red
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
died
with
the
beer
and
left
lace
patches
a
grape
and
oaky
smell
like
a
mild
red
wine
with
sour
fruits
like
grape
and
cherry
along
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
fruit
taste
is
mostly
grape
and
cherry
with
there
being
a
light
sour
fruit
taste
but
also
some
sweetness
in
this
mediumbodied
ale
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
while
retaining
a
crispness
and
dryness
from
the
sour
fruit

and
intense

with
the

but
very
easy
to
reorder
after
the
first
d
easy
to
drink
while
not
the
best
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
i
can
definitely
trace
the
roots
of
beers
like
la
folie
to
this
excellent
beer
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again

well
as
try

d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
flanders
red
if
youre
into
these
styles
of
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
there
isnt
a
whle
lot
of
vinegar
flavors
just
a
hint
in
the
nose
a
good
beer
i
would
really
enjoy
this
beer
if
it
did
not
have
the
vinegar
aftertaste
this
was
probably
hands
down
the
most
interesting
tasting
beer
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
it
is
different
i
could
imagine
this
would
taste
great
blended
with
a
triple
your
average
beer
drinking
would
probably
spit
this
out
and
cry
foul
those
that
dont
spit
it
out
and
like
it
would
probably
seek
this
out
the
rest
of
their
life
i
am
probably
one
of
the
few
that
enjoys
and
appreciates
but
i
honestly
do
not
not
love
this
beer
md
the
restrained
delicate
even
level
of
dryish
hops
and
woody
lactic
sourness
makes
this
ale
a
very
drinkable
and
approachable
one
the
carbonation
is
mild
the
body
retains
its
integrity
without
going
thin
at
all
throughout
the
drink
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
delicious
example
of
flemish
oud
bruin
to
me
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
for
a
little
something
different
appeared
a
hazy
redbrown
everyone
is
right
this
beer
is
a
lot
like
the
duchesse
in
fact
im
not
even
sure
how
it
varies
its
sweet
and
smooth
at
first
followed
by
a
sharp
vinegarsour
tang
the
malts
have
subtle
berry
fruit
flavors
and
the
beer
finishes
on
a
tangy
note
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
the
style
drinkabilitycoming
off
of
duchesse
and
echte
kriek
this
one
does
not
touch
the
same
sour
tonesalthough
i
do
like
it
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
will
look
for
it
again
d
i
couldnt
finish
this
beerthe
vinegar
got
to
me
after
a
while
thats
not
to
say
that
this
beer
isnt
worth
drinking
it
was
just
too
much
for
me
d
this
is
a
great
flanders
red
it
could
use
some
more
sourtartvinegar
in
the
flavor
but
it
still
tastes
great
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
the
flanders
red
style
this
was
another
excellent
example
though
not
quite
up
to
part
with
duchesse
or
rodenbach

poured
a
deep
hazy

notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
tasty
oak
notes
with
a
light
lingering
sour
note
with
some
sweet
cherries
i
thought
the
bit
was
slightly
overly
sweet
but
oak
notes
were
just
about
perfect
carbonation
might
have
been
a

low

the

could
use
some
work
and
that
is
the
only
real
flaw
that
i
can
find
the

is
where
this

lets
you

the

id
hand
to
someone
who
had
never
had
a

if
only
we
could
acquire
this
brew
in
my
home
state
smooth

its
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
ale
that
reminds
me
why
i
love
this
style
better
with
every
sip
and
just
unlike
any
other
i
look
forward
to
every
new

burgundy
edges

a
thin

aroma
is
a

with
lots

this
is
an
extremely
well
balanced
beer
that
is

the
againg

the

it

lacy

the
nose
has

malts
sour
fruit
and
a
unique
barnyard

crisp
body
drinks
well
a
nice
beer
i
like
it
i
have
no
clue
whether
this
is
right
for
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
not
really
sure
what
i
would
pare
this
with
but
its
working
well
as
an
apertif
im
not
even
sure
theres
another
beer
of
this
style
available
around
here
but
if
i
come
across
one
ill
check
it
out
to
compare
it
to
this
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
i
had
this
bottle
at
beer
mania
in
brussels
drinkability
is
fairly
high
this
is
tasty
and
certainly
easy
to
drink
the
dryness
keeps
it
from
being
too
sour
and
makes
it
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
sour
but
soft
not
too
overpowering
carbonation
is
tickling
and
soft
easy
to
drink
had
this
at
delirium

in

finish
nice
red
color
and
great
nose
that
pops
out
during
the

nice
mild

with
a
nice
smoothness
its
not
tear
your
face
off
sour
it
is
a
nice
mellow
sour
that
id
love
to
be
enjoying
some

redbrown
color
with
an

wont

this
has
less
balsamic
notes
than
the
duchesse
but
i
can
still
smell
it
tart
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
taste
is
vinegar
with
some
sweetness
it
starts
to
get
flat
and
lose
some
of
the
tartness
towards
the
end
let
me
start
out
by
saying
im
a
big
fan
of
flemish
sour
ales
and
make
an
effort
to
try
every
one
i
come
across
poured
this
sample
into
a
chimay
goblet
which
contributed
to
the
quicker
evaporation
of
the
lightly
tan
one
finger
head
the
beer
is
an
attractive
brown
w
a
red
hue
to
it
the
smell
is
classic
cider
vinegar
but
not
as
strong
as
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
and
nowhere
near
as
strong
as
rodenbach
grand
cru
as
previously
stated
by
other
reviewers
this
beer
is
an
impressive
juxtaposition
btw
a
classic
flemish
red
and
an
oud
bruin
its
not
as
lactic
as
most
serious
flemish
reds
but
its
much
more
tart
than
oud
bruins
i
get
more
of
an
apple
tartness
than
a
cherry
tartness
with
this
one
simply
delicious
overall
i
believe
this
is
a
style
that
needs
to
grow
on
you
more
like
wine
than
beer
not
easydrinking
or
for
sessions
but
probably
a
good
example
of
the
style
just
not
a
personal
favorite
for
me
enjoyed
at
monks
in
a
side
by
side
comparison
to
monks
flemish
red
ale
extremely
tall
head
after
the
pour
which
quickly
dissipated
leaving
only
the
sweetsour
very
slightly
vinegary
smell
of
a
good
flemish
red
taste
is
fairly
similar
to
the
monks
beer
but
not
quite
as
sweet
and
with
less
of
a
presence
of
fruit
in
my
opinion
probably
the
best
sweettart
ratio
of
any
of
the
sour
beers
doesnt
have
as
strong
of
a
vinegar
taste
as
say
a
rodenbach
gives
off
but
does
have
some
cider
vinegar
present
as
previous
reviewers
have
mentioned
it
could
stand
to
be
more
sour
and
is
definitely
lacking
in
intensity
compared
to
a
rodenbach
or
some
of
the
lambics
still
a
very
tasty
beer
and
definitely
recommended
to
anyone
who
cares
for
flemish
reds
bit
of
cidery
vinegar
in
there
not
really
turning
me
off
but
its
there
no
alcohol
to
speak
of
really
a
good
beer
but
with
all
the
sweet
and
dark
sugar
notes
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
my
previous
brew
was
a
rodenbach
vichtenaar
is
a
good
but
not
great
flanders
red
or
brown
im
not
really
sure
good
interesting
beer
the
iron
flavor
is
oddly
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
borderline
mahogany
with
a
nice
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
aromas
start
out
richly
acetic
lots
of
vinegar
candy
sweetness
vanilla
chocolate
oak
cherries
its
gorgeous
on
the
palate
things
continue
to
develop
the
sourness
starts
out
rich
and
oaky
fruity
spicy
phenols
finishing
dry
and
mellow
without
being
overly
tart
enough
sweetness
there
that
the
tannic
astringency
in
the
end
is
buffered
overall
its
an
excellent
beer
but
i
think
it
still
falls
short
of
my
other
favorites
in
this
style
a
clean
dark
brown
ale
with
deep
ruby
highlights
has
a
small
off
white
head
with
alittle
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
has
a
strong
sour
malt
character
with
almost
a
apple
cider
not
hard
apple
cider
but
that
unfiltered
kind
you
get
from
orchards
backbone
and
hints
of
spices
the
taste
starts
with
a
sweet
and
tarts
snap
on
the
tongue
pushed
ahead
quickly
nice
prickly
carbonation
the
sourness
with
hints
of
apple
grabs
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
just
before
the
clean
and
refreshing
finish
this
one
goes
down
nice
and
easy
poured
from
a
bottle
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
redddish
brown
with
a
ggood
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
that
sticks
around
sour
acetic
aromas
red
wine
vinegar
like
with
sweet
and
somewhat
spicy
overtones
of
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
with
a
bitter
finish
quite
soft
and
not
all
that
complex
soft
gentle
mouthfeel
this
is
a
flanders
red
with
training
wheels
from
the
makers
of
duchesse
de
bourgogne
the
cap
pops
with
a
highpitched
hiss
and
the
carbonation
seems
lively
from
the
pour
a
clear
nice
redchestnut
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
drops
to
an
attractive
light
and
lacey
cover
the
nose
is
pretty
clean
and
mild
but
offers
a
hint
of
sour
and
fruitiness
malts
and
hops
take
back
seat
it
seems
to
fall
somewhere
between
a
flanders
red
and
brun
as
the
bottle
describes
with
more
restrained
sour
than
the
former
and
lacking
the
maltiness
of
the
latter
the
flavors
are
balanced
between
sweet
and
sour
from
start
to
finish
the
complexity
falls
within
a
range
of
sweet
and
sour
fruits
cherry
apricots
peach
as
well
as
some
winey
flavors
the
finish
is
refreshing
with
a
pleasant
impression
of
the
sour
flavors
the
carbonation
that
was
evident
at
first
is
a
bit
less
lively
in
the
mouth
and
would
have
added
a
bit
to
the
medium
mouthfeel
a
very
enjoyable
drink
not
too
complex
but
never
unbalanced
a
good
beer
recommended
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
ruby
with
a
light
tan
head
off
an
aggressive
pour
the
head
falls
fast
nose
is
a
beautiful
combination
of
wood
and
cherries
flavor
is
a
great
sweetness
combined
with
firm
cherry
tones
the
wood
character
really
meshes
with
everything
else
so
well
that
it
provides
the
perfect
punctuation
feel
is
great
the
bubble
still
kicks
me
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
after
its
lingered
in
my
mouth
for
a
while
overall
a
great
drinking
experience
elegant
and
smooth
and
well
made
very
well
worth
trying
out
and
having
more
beyond
high
carbonation
with
just
a
little
warmth
and
a
nice
juicy
vinous
quality
on
the
tongue
surprisingly
the
booze
is
detectable
despite
the
low

the

of
the

actually

flanders

from
verhaeghe
almost
up
there
with
the
duchesse

highly
recommended
great
drinkability
for
the
low

and
qualities
the
better
brews
of
this
style
have
as
noted
overall
as
far
as
flemish
or
flanders
ales
go
this
is
a
good
one
the
best
ive
had
to
date
is
duchesse
de
bourgogne
to
which
this
compares
favorably
not
terribly
sour
but
you
definitely
know
youre
having
something
different
good
representation
of
style
not
something
id
pursue
but
i
admire
the
art
that
goes
into
this
type
of
beer
nonetheless
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
drinkability
this
was
only
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
the
first
was
at
the
return
of
the
belgian
beer
fest
in
boston
last
year
at
that
time
i
swore
i
would
find
this
beer
again
and
purchase
enough
to
last
me
into
retirement
sadly
i
had
to
settle
for
splitting
a
bottle
over
the
abovementioned
food
pairing
i
will
say
the
paring
was
exceptional
and
really
brought
out
the
warm
tartness
present
in
the
marinade
this
is
a
fine
representation
of
a
flanders
red
ale
and
a
totally
different
profile
when
compared
with
a
rodenbach
rodenbach
grande
cru
or
monks
sour
ale
ive
heard
that
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
has
a
simlar
profile
that
will
be
my
next
stop
just
goes
to
show
the
variety
present
and
the
ability
to
experience
the
joys
in
the
variety
poured
out
a
dark
cherry
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
has
a
nice
sour
flemish
nose
leathery
sweaty
horse
saddle
dehydrated
cherries
wet
socks
and
prune
the
taste
was
tart
and
refreshing
it
offered
sourness
cherry
sloe
gin
and
woody
resin
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
medium
carbonation
this
style
is
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
an
excellent
example
and
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
within
the
confines
of
the
style
what
a
delightful
beer
a
very
fine
flemish
red
ale
of
the
sour
variety
vichtenaar
holds
a
third
candle
to
duchesse
and
rodenbach
in
the
running
but
this
truly
is
an
enjoyable
beer
the
smell
is
a
little
much
even
for
someone
like
me
who
really
enjoys
the
style
it
may
be
a
little
too
vinegary
a
little
too
tart
in
the
nose
but
it
is
fine
nevertheless
the
pour
is
the
right
combination
of
dark
chestnut
carbonation
and
head
for
this
style
basically
there
isnt
much
head
at
all
and
very
little
lacing
the
taste
is
a
nice
complex
blend
of
aged
and
newer
ales
giving
this
ale
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
sour
chartreuse
citrus
and
vinegar
to
stir
the
palate
the
flemish
reds
are
truly
a
chewy
digestive
that
complement
meats
and
cheeses
not
quite
as
good
as
duchesse
and
rodenbach
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
nevertheless
and
if
i
want
a
slight
change
of
pace
for
a
flemish
red
i
would
go
back
to
it
again
and
again
there
is
an
ironlike
feel
and
taste
on
the
back
end
a
bit
more
than
should
be
but
this
should
not
deter
the
adventurous
lchaim
very
thin
for
my
taste
although
theres
a
redeeming
creaminess
to
the
finish
an
ok
sour
but
id
take
a
rodenbach
or
duchesse
any
day
of
the
week
over
this
d
very
nice
example
of
the
flanders
red
ale
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
and
give
it
a
solid
recommendation
980
this
would
be
the
first
step
on
the
road
of
flemish
sours
next
duchesse
leading
up
to
rodenbach
grand
cru
cheers
pours
very
dark
brownishred
color
there
is
a
very
thin
layer
of
head
that
mostly
clings
to
the
side
hard
to
see
the
carbonation
as
it
is
so
dark
the
aroma
is
very
strong
and
is
that
of
whiskey
but
with
a
little
fruit
the
flavor
is
extremely
complex
and
is
hard
to
distinguish
all
the
flavors
but
has
a
little
whiskey
that
is
a
little
fruity
and
tart
too
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
it
is
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
is
very
high
because
youll
have
to
drink
several
of
these
before
you
can
figure
out
all
the
aromas
and
tastes
pours
an
opaque
dark

is
almost
a

held
up
to
the

about
a

it

has
not

the
taste
matches
perfectlyit
starts
out
sour
with
a
sweet
and
somewhat
fruity
cherries
apples
aftertaste
without
being
too
sweet
i
would
say
that
the
sweet
and
sour
flavors
are
very
well
balancedwhich
also
increases
the
drinkability
from
the
same
people
who
brought
you
duchesse
de
bougogne
this
flanders
shares
some
of
the
same
traits
that
you
either
loved
or
loathed
over
its
more
popular
sibling
i
personally
love
both
tart
yet
very
drinkable
and
overall
very
tasty
indeed
i
would
still
push
for
something
a
bit
less
sweet
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
in
the
long
run
but
this
makes
a
welcome
change
and
is
definatly
something
worth
trying
this
brew
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
almost
brown
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
red
in
color
the
aroma
is
sour
with
hints
of
cherry
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
for
a
flemish
red
there
really
isnt
much
sourness
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
beer
isnt
nearly
as
sour
as
i
expect
a
flemish
red
to
be
however
it
is
still
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
arent
looking
for
something
extremely
sour
only
the
3rd
beer
i
have
given
a
5

this

a

of

the
way
everything
comes
together
in
this
beer
to
give

a
roller
coaster
of
an

is
a
work
of
art
i
am
hoping
i
find
another
flemish
ale
in
my
treasure
chest
to
keep
with
the
treasure
analogy
this
was
a
gem
a
perfect
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
this
beer
is
nicely
smooth
with
flavorful
bursts
of
cherry
this
beer
finds
itself
somewhere
between
rodenbach
and
redbach
this
is
fantastic
easy
to
drink
with
low
enough
alcohol
to
make
this
a
session
beer
though
the
price
puts
it
out
of
that
range
seek
this
one
out
it
is
worth
it
lately
i
have
been
loving
flanders
reds
so
its
no
surprise
i
picked
this
one
up
it
poured
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
color
with
a
medium
sized
dense
head
that
never
really
went
away
smell
is
malty
with
hints
of
tart
cherries
and
a
faint
hint
of
oak
kinda
lacking
overall
but
not
a
bad
smell
by
any
means
taste
is
oaky
peppery
with
hints
of
cherries
nice
tartsweet
balance
really
well
made
example
of
the
style
i
think
the
pepperyness
really
plays
well
off
the
tartness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
bitter
and
sticky
sweet
drinkability
on
this
is
pretty
darn
good
this
is
my
2nd
time
having
the
beer
the
first
time
i
must
admit
i
couldnt
finish
it
but
that
was
before
my
tastes
had
adapted
to
like
belgian
style
ales
if
you
like
belgians
and
particularly
flanders
red
ales
dont
miss
this
one
its
pretty
tasty
drinkability
is
good
for
a
flanders
red
this
would
be
a
great
candidate
for
someone
new
to
the
style
however
the
flavors
are
little
bland
for
a
fan
of
flemish
beers
the
head
isnt
thick
but
it
doesnt
go
away
completely
the
lacing
is
beautiful
and
sticks
really
well
the
color
is
dark
to
reddish
brown
smell
is
fruity
and
sour
very
enjoyable
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
less
sour
its
almost
like
sour
fruit
juice
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
was
very
drinkable
and
nice
to
have
i
will
enjoy
more
of
these
refreshing
clean
feel
with
a
fruity
sweetness
sweet
malts
cherries
and
grapes
with
a
faint
hint
of
grapefruity
sour
fairly
sweet
but
not
excessive
or
cloying
very
flavorful
and
exceedingly
drinkable
drinkabitly
is
alright
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
i
suspect
its
style
isnt
my
type
but
ill
try
a
few
more
very
vinegar
and
oak
dominated
aroma
that
both
play
off
each
other
to
effect
a
sharp
spiciness
body
is
a
mild
brown

holds

malty

with
just
a

it
i
did
not
expect
sorta
like
a
standard
english
brown
ale
with
some
funk
added
even
has
a
very
mild
nuttiness
to
it
though
sweeter
than
a
normal
brown
the
finish
is
almost
bread
puddingesque
being
sweet
yet
hearty
and
midly
toasty
big
suprise
and
i
rather
enjoy
this
one
faint
hints
of
vanilla
in
the
far
aftertaste
drinkability
i
love
this
style
for
probably
too
many
reasons
i
cant
explain
this
is
a
more
than
solid
version
of
it
id
say
even
though
i
certainly
need
to
have
more
in
the
future
without
a
doubt
id
like
some
more
sour
in
this
beer
because
without
it
vichtenaar
takes
a
hit
on
dimensionality
still
this
is

sophisticated
civilized

achievement
in

well
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
with
some

and

this
beer
was
part
of
the
michael
jackson
flemish
sour
beer
dinner
at
monks
cafe
this
past
sunday
i
believe
this
one
was
served
on
tap
this
beer
came
in
a
wine
glass
with
nice
deep
ruby
body
and
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
a
very
vital
cherry
smell
with
some
other
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
sour
cheeries
and
good

crisp
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
with
a
medium
body
is
a
very
drinkable
red
ale
i
went
back
for
seconds
this
beer
promises
a
lot
in
the
nose
and
delivers
some
of
it
a
pleasant
and
far
too
drinkable
flemish
red
ale
worth
finding
to
try
lovely

dark

lots
of

great

wellbalanced
with
lots

cherry

possibly
my
most
enjoyed

in

with

that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a

of

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
julios

westborough
ma
pours
out
dark
brown
with
a
slight
rust
tinge
the
head
is
not
huge
but
maintains
a
rather
creamy
looking
centimeter
or
two
smells
sweet
vinegarlike
fruity
oaky
this
smells
exactly
like
this
halfmuscathalfblueberry
wine
ive
had
some
time
ago
tastes
like
ripe
juicy
cherries
and
oak
starts
off
sweet
then
finishes
up
tart
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
lively
on
the
tongue
it
perfectly
accentuates
the
sweet
and
tart
characteristics
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
oakey
scent
that
blends
well
with
the
sour
aroma
it
seems
to
have
some
maltiness
to
it
the
taste
is
great
also
it
has
a
wonderful
malt
complexity
that
is
complimented
with
a
refreshing
sourness
as
well
as
a
slight
woody
finish
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
i
love
the
flavor
as
well
as
the
aroma
it
has
a
subtle
sourness
that
is
very
enjoyable
unlike
some
that
are
too
sour
to
drink
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
in
bottle
at
the
brick
store
in
decatur
ga
this
is
my
second
favorite
beer
in
the
world
followed
only
by
duchesse
de
bourgogne
it
pours
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
medium
brown
with
a
quickly
fading
head
that
leaves
a
fairy
ring
and
a
bit
of
pattering
on
the
top
it
has
moderate
lacing
for
the
first
half
of
the
session
the
smell
is
a
very
sharp
vinegar
and
musk
the
smell
however
is
much
more
sour
than
the
flavor
the
flavor
is
a
very
complex
cascade
of
sweet
sour
carbonation
with
brown
sugar
and
dried
fruit
overtones
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
with
serious
carbonation
pricking
it
isnt
as
drinkable
as
duchesse
de
bourgogne
but
its
a
very
close
second
if
greens
package
store
would
carry
this
beer
i
would
stock
it
at
my
place
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
red
with
a
thicky
creamy
head
really
rich
and
so
smooth
in
the
mouth
smells
of
sour
funk
and
chocolate
on
the
palate
there
is
rich
milk
chocolate
dark
chocolate
with
sour
red
vinegar
funk
wow
a
really
unique
beer
taste
is
well
balanced
for
the
style
i
think
fruity
winey
slightly
sour
oak
and
some
sweetness
for
balance
a
little
buttery
not
as
acidic
or
sour
as
others
of
its
ilk
the
bubbles
are
very
fine
and
they
are
many
drinkability
is
great
probably
due
to
the
mild
nature
of
the
beer
complexity
suffers
as
a
result
drinkability
is
ok
but
wouldnt
grab
this
one
first
if
i
was
in
a
flanders
red
mood
d
drinkability
is
quite
good
murky
looking
burgandy
tone
thin
light
brown
head
lace
is
stringy
and
sparse
strong
aroma
of
vinegar
brown
sugar
and
blackberries
the
acetic
acid
is
dominating
though
smell
reminds
me
of
easter
egg
coloring
time
now
on
the
buds
i
dont
get
the
expected
blast
of
acidity
rather
a
nice
blance
of
sweet
and
sour
though
the
scale
tips
in
favor
of
the
sweet
nuances
sweet
cherry
juice
brown
sugar
molasses
tart
black
berries
a
slight
bit
of
rice
vinegar
quite
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
more
carbonated
than
most
other
flanders
styles
ive
enjoyed
but
its
compatible
with
the
beer
its
not
overly
so
carbonated
alcohol
is
absent
in
the
flavor
theres
really
a
nice
little
tug
of
war
between
sweet
and
sour
in
this
beer
that
i
like
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airey
in
spite
of
the
medium
body
very
slick
tecture
and
huge
drinkability
the
most
sessionable
and
approachable
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
vichtenaar
is
a
decent
flanders
red
although
i
have
to
believe
that
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
perhaps
the
cherriness
of
its
brewery
mate
echte
kriekenbier
will
be
more
to
my
liking
and
will
provide
what
i
found
to
be
lacking
in
this
bottle
burgundy
red
sweettart
apple
cider
vinegar
a
touch
of
musty
funkyness
both
sweet
and
sour
cherries
fuzzy
carbonation
and
a
little
cane
sugar
all
swirling
together
in
a
riot
for
all
the
flavors
going
on
this
still
seemed
to
have
a
bit
less
depth
than
others
of
the
style
ive
had
350
ml

dark
maroon
body
shows
off
a
lot
of
red
shades
in
the
darkness
creamy
off
white
head
leaves
good
lace
smell
is
very
sour
funky
and
tart
this
being
my
first
flanders
red
i
have
nothing
to
go
against
except
what
i
have
seen
from
the
oud
bruins
it
does
have
a
lot
of
the
same
characteristics
of
that
style
tase
is
funky
and
intense
but
does
have
a
fruitier
aspect
than
the
oud
bruins
a
very
tart
and
interesting
beer
i
would
like
to
have
tried
this
up
against
another
red
but
there
arent
that
many
available
here
taste
less
acidic
than
most
flemish
sours
ive
had
before
but
with
a
stronger
bite
in
the
end
sounds
a
little
contradictory
but
that
how
it
tasted
to
me
the
oak
comes
through
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
like
a
good
quality
aged
balsamic
vinegar
i
almost
like
it
as
much
as
rodenbach
grand
cru
i
am
really
growing
to
love
this
style
however
this
isnt
the
best
example
of
flanders
reds
albeit
good
aromas
quickly
surface
that
reminds
me
of
red
vinegar
merlot
apple
cider
and
accompanied
by
a
mellow
astringency
amberish
rust
in
color
quite
high
co2
a
dainty
head
that
doent
impress
the
high
demands
on
barley
and
other
grains
sweeten
and
up
the
body
to
balance
out
the
sourness
and
tartness
that
is
experienced
in
the
nose
finishes
musty
and
with
a
dry
tartness
a
likable
beer
one
that
i
will
enjoy
on
occasions
despite
a
few
quirks
pillowy
smooth
head
lasting
on
a
pretty
brown
mahogany
color
body
the
smell
immediately
shows
the
typical
flemish
character
sour
and
wooden
the
taste
shows
more
roundness
with
the
tart
citric
aspect
being
balanced
by
sweet
fruity
notes
and
a
wooden
and
very
slightly
chocolaty
character
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
very
round
and
creamy
quite
enjoyable
with
the
carbonation
that
nicely
brings
fresh
lemony
notes
quite
drinkable
from
notes
darklight
ruby
red
depending
on
the
light
of
the
day
small
fizzy
head
is
not
too
impressive
and
does
not
provide
nice
lacing
aromas
are
all
balsamic
vinegar
dark
raspberries
cherries
and
some
lactic
sour
funk
as
well
taste
follows
suit
with
some
very
sour
acidic
notes
and
some
lactic
chalkiness
as
well
totally
suitable
to
a
flemish
red
or
bruin
and
i
happen
to
love
it
not
the
most
complex
in
this
style
but
certainly
nice
enough
and
totally
comparable
to
the
other
3
or
so
flemish
reds
from
this
belgian
brewery
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
acrid
but
somehow
likeable
and
drinkability
remains
good
i
dont
normally
like
beers
that
are
tangy
or
have
any
fruit
nuances
this
is
my
first
flanders
red
and
im
going
back
to
the
store
this
week
to
pick
up
other
examples
from
this
style
drinkability
and
overall
out
of
the
3
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
this
one
is
in
the
middle
better
than
the
echte
kriekenbier
but
definitly
not
close
to
the
duchesse
this
an
enjoyable
beer
id
reccomend
trying
once
but
not
buying
a
whole
case
of
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
little
to
no
head
no
lacing
smell
of
cherries
but
not
too
much
and
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
nose
taste
is
an
unexpected
sweet
shouldnt
this
style
be
sour
sure
there
is
a
hint
of
the
sourness
but
taste
is
dominated
by
a
carbonated
cherry
juice
flavor
not
unpleasant
but
this
is
more
like
a
fruit
lambic
the
sweetness
tends
to
make
this
feel
fuller
than
some
flanders
reds
however
the
complexity
isnt
there
easy
to
drink
the
spouse
thought
it
was
sour
but
she
had
just
had
strawberries
ill
stick
with
the
goundenband
ontap
at
cah
this
is
a
mixed
bag
i
love
flemish
ales
and
oud
bruins
but
this
is
like
a
mishmash
of
vinegar
and
sugar
its
too
diametric
and
the
flavors
arent
cohesive
id
pass
on
this
one
again
on
tap
differences
not
nearly
as
sweet
more
tart
but
not
like
vinegar
more
cherry
flavor
very
drinkable
remeniscent
of
a
wine
the
tap
version
would
get
a
rating
of
at
least
a
half
point
higher
puckering
and
sweet
lightly
oaky
with
hints
of
vanilla
more
sweet
than
sour
could
use
a
bit
more
sour
to
balance
the
sweet
but
lots
of
flavor
full
bodied
with
a
lightly
sour
aftertaste
a
pretty
good
flanders
red
verhaeghes
vichtenaar
nestles
nicely
between
some
of
the
more
sour
and
overlysweet
examples
of
the
flanders
red
style
it
pours
a
clear
dark
chestnut
robe
with
orangeruby
highlights
and
a
thin
head
of
creamy
tan
foam
the
head
drops
readily
yet
somehow
manages
to
maintain
a
wide
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
a
few
splashes
of
sticky
lace
about
the
goblet
add
to
its
appearance
in
the
nose
a
combination
of
delicate
but
somewhat
sharp
vinous
fruit
and
sweetish
malt
greets
you
its
delicately
effervescent
on
the
tongue
with
a
very
fine
bubbled
slightly
elevated
carbonation
and
it
becomes
somewhat
airy
as
it
crosses
the
palate
muted
caramel
and
soft
subtly
tart
dark
skinned
fruit
figs
plums
raisinsdark
grapes
combine
in
the
flavor
leaving
it
quite
sherrylike
its
fairly
intense
upfront
before
fading
slowly
and
seamlessly
away
into
a
longlasting
aftertaste
that
is
again
not
unlike
that
of
a
glass
of
sherry
or
port
and
thats
the
beauty
of
the
flanders
red
style
the
push
and
pull
between
the
tart
and
the
sweet
the
way
the
sourness
lingers
on
your
lips
but
the
sticky
dull
malt
lays
on
your
teeth
and
at
the
back
of
the
throat
its
quite
nicely
done
and
certainly
worth
trying
although
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
breadth
of
character
that
some
other
examples
do
sampled
at
monks
in
philly
only
my
second
visit
and
it
just
keeps
getting
better

must

this

me
by
total
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
tart
sour
aroma
but
vinegar
taste
malty
sweetness
up

balanced
out
by
the
aforementioned
balsmic

drinkable
i
know
my
review
sounds
somewhat
negative
to
this
point
but
its
more
from
my
incredulity
than
from
my
lack
of
enjoyment
of
this
beer
i
have
to
say
this
was
the
most
unusual
yet
enjoyable
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
a
drinking
quality
balsamic
vinegar
is
produced
and
used
as
an
digestif
i
have
never
tried
this
but
i
have
to
assume
that
it
would
be
similar
to
vichtenaar
try
this
unique
taste
experience
if
you
get
the
chance
i
liked
this
beer
i
liked
this
style
im
definitely
going
to
try
to
get
more
into
it
once
i
can
find
more
examples
unfortunately
west
mich
is
lacking
in
options
i
bet
this
one
would
go
really
well
with
some
flavorful
italian
food
either
way
a
very
tasty
brew
drinkability

this
can
be
a
harsh
style
to
drink
but
the
vichtenaar
was
mellow
and
easy
going
im
partial
to
black
cherries
so
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
verhaeghe
this
flanders
red
ale
poured
a
clear
almost
opaque
redbrown
color
with
creamy
tall
slightly
pink
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
lightly
sweet
and
fruity
the
taste
was
very
sweet
and
sugary
with
a
flavor
of
sour
cherries
the
mouthfeel
was
tangy
and
smooth
with
medium
body
and
strong
carbonation
the
sourness
and
sugar
lingered
this
was
an
ok
ale
though
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
likes
drinkability
belgian
sour
ales
are
clearly
an
acquired
taste
and
while
the
longer
i
savored
this
brew
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
all
in
all
i
think
its
a
bit
sweet
to
drink
too
many
of
id
like
to
see
it
dried
out
a
bit
a
very
nice
flemish
ale
not
overly
sweet
and
a
most
enjoyable
sipper
reminiscent
of
a
fine
sherry
in
texture
at
times
but
more
like
a
lambic
fruit
ale
in
taste
i
must
admit
i
was
surprised
i
liked
this
as
much
as
i
did
even
though
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
oak
and
vinegar
dominate
the
aroma
with
hints
of
cherry
and
the
lobby
of
a
florist
sweeter
much
like
dutchess
versus
young
rodenbach
or
something
else
in
that
style
more
cherry
and
oak
damn
thats
good
finishes
with
a
mild
sour
zip
and
a
mild
rindlike
bitterness
when
warm
drinking
more
reveals
hints
of
brown
sugar
laced
throughout
i
could
sip
on
this
all
evening
i
could
make
a
marinade
and
reduction
out
of
this
for
a

i
could
put

a

good
drinkable
beer
in
my
favorite
style
labeled
as
a
flemish
redbrown
never
seen
anyone
claim
both
of
these
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
it
has
a
nice
sour
nose
but
does
not
quite
deliver
in
the
taste
sour
up
front
with
hints
of
balsamic
but
this
fades
to
a
malty
caramelized
sweetness
that
is
a
bit
out

this
beer
definitely
needs
more
sour
character
definitely
not

2oz
bottle
best
before
160605
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
lots
of
active
carbonation
yet
leaving
no
head
aroma
starts
off
with
vinegar
followed
by
a
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruit
mouthfeel
is
a
high
carbonation
and
very
lively
the
flavor
is
a
vingary
sweet
malt
blend
that
i
cant
decide
whether
i
like
or
not
the
style
is
relatively
new
to
me
so
i
could
be
off
on
my
judgement
overall
an
interesting
ale
with
maybe
a
tad
too
much
vinegar
for
my
liking
where
to
start
everything
about
this
beer
is
thick
the
taste
is
oud
bruin
with
an
extra
bucket
of
thick
and
heavy
malts
added
sour
cherries
blackberries
drinkable
yes
very
much
so
but
just
as
you
wouldnt
spend
a
night
drinking
rochefort
10
you
wont
spend
a
night
drinking
this
fantastic
though
this
is
right
up
my
alley
to
coin
a
phrase
balsamic
red
meat
blood
butter
menthol
intersting
sour
cherries
chocolate
malt
vineagr
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
it
is
the
unpleasant
butter
menthol
undertones
which
is
found
in
their
noel
some
minerally
notes
aswell
all
round
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
body
is
mediumlight
perfect
for
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
like
this
aftertaste
strong
fruity
an
wood
has
an
interesting
red
wine
vinegar
finish
very
tasty
incredibly
complex
balanced
flavor
that
lingers
forever
you
can
taste
the
oak
great
beer
awful
taste
of
malt
vinegar
with
weird
sweetness
to
it
if
this
isnt
a
spoiled
bottle
there
is
something
seriously
wrong
with
the
brewers
cuz
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
drank
including
an
infect
vanilla
noir
from
prairie
i
feel
like
this
would
work
well
poured
onto
an
itallian
sub
as
dressing
very
enjoyable
and
complex
taste
thus
this
ones
wellrecommended
if
you
like
sour
beers
this
is
a
great
one
the
nose
was
really
vinegary
the
taste
was
alright
the
only
thing
i
really
liked
about
it
was
a
little
wheat
finish
sourness
and
tartness
are
extremely
high
the
beer
has
a
light
body
and
a
nice
carbonation
tart
nose
with
slight
wet
horse
blanket
red
fruit
not
much
hop
malt
with
slight
chocolate
pours
brilliant
reddish
brown
not
a
lot
of
head
on
the
palate
ripe
and
over
ripe
fruit
with
cherries
at
the
front
with
the
sour
coming
on
by
the
middle
and
then
a
slight
touch
of
hops
finishes
a
little
sweet
almost
like
they
added
some
sweetness
to
increase
the
marketability
medium
body
medium
low
carbonation
no
alcohol
slightly
creamy
very
sweet
finish
overall
impression
the
head
was
somewhat
light
drinkable
but
too
sweet
lacking
complexity
should
be
drier
20
a
four
pack
and
it
is
god
awful
holy
fn
s
this
beer
blows
good
example
of
a
sour
tart
solar
to
cider
but
with
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
cheers
to
flanders
and
the
duchesse
try
it
youll
certainly
be
trying
something
unique
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
like
youre
drinking
straight
vinegar
and
feels
like
it
on
the
way
down
i
appreciate
a
good
sour
beer
but
this
is
not
one
o
this
has
been
a
drain
pour
the
last
two
times
ive
tried
it
again
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
seems
very
different
maybe
im
just
not
into
these
types
of
belgians
but
it
had
a
bacterial
flavor
to
it
that
was
not
appetizing
to
me
or
my
friends
ok
so
i
really
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
can
certainly
respect
every
aspect
of
this
drink
the
bold
fragrance
that
carried
so
much
complexity
to
the
taste
the
mirrored
the
complexity
vinegar
dark
fruit
sour
patch
kid
sort
of
sourness
up
front
wit
a
slightly
salty
finish
well
balanced
well
crafted
and
certainly
most
likely
an
icon
for
the
style
for
a
flander
red
i
guess
its
good
but
ick
no
one
should
really
like
drinking
vinegar
this
might
be
the
worst
thing
i
have
ever
put
it
my
mouth
the
texture
is
fantastic
the
color
is
also
perfect
let
me
say
this
if
you
have
always
wanted
to
down
a
bottle
of
balsamic
vinegar
then
this
is
the
best
bottle
for
you
if
you
prefer
a
tasty
sour
beer
do
not
go
with
this
i
am
extremely
disappointed
and
puzzled
why
this
beer
has
such
a
high
ranking
it
is
1112
and
i
feel
like
i
am
now
forced
to
drink
it
let
me
just
drink
a
bottle
of
gasoline
and
anthrax
instead
bleck
overall
pretty
amazingly
good
sour
if
you
like
vinegar
specifically
balsamic
you
have
to
try
this
on
draught
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
smooth
taste
easy
drinking
o
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
the
holygrail
of
sour
ales
so
enjoyable
and
interesting
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
happily
enjoy
it
over
and
over
again
definitely
needs
to
be
on
your
to
try
list
way
better
on
tap
than
in
a
bottle
ive
had
both
and
the
bottle
can
end
up
soapy
smelling
an
amazing
drinking
experience
my
first
flanders
red
and
what
a
treat
it
was
the
obvious
tangy
sour
qualities
were
marvelously
complemented
by
an
almost
balsamic
vinegarlike
note
that
was
both
sweet
and
savory
a
tremendous
choice
to
accompany
pasta
with
a
rich
hearty
bolognese
sauce
due
to
that
outstanding
acidity
there
are
very
few
beers
that
i
will
not
finish
and
this
is
surely
one
of
those
ill
admit
the
appearance
of
the
bear
is
quite
nice
with
a
dark
brownruby
like
color
in
terms
of
the
nose
the
cherries
are
the
most
noticeable
with
vinegar
and
pomegranate
coming
in
a
close
second
however
the
taste
of
the
beer
did
not
agree
with
me
at
all
although
it
is
possible
that
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
overall
i
felt
there
was
way
too
much
vinegar
and
when
combined
with
the
richness
of
the
beer
made
me
feel
sick
enough
to
only
handle
a
few
sips
on
top
of
that
the
beer
had
a
very
metallic
aftertaste
which
was
very
unpleasant
and
unlike
any
other
sour
i
have
experienced
my
brother
who
was
with
me
had
the
same
experience
tasting
this
beer
amazing
sour
beer
slightly
tangy
smell
of
wine
with
sour
pomegranate
taste
with
a
tangy
end
taste
black
cherry
plum
raspberry
tartness
at
the
end
some
pepper
in
the
middle
and
at
the
end
such
a
fantastic
flanders
red
explosive
and
complex
flavors
abound
starts
or
somewhat
tart
and
finishes
clean
and
fruity
o
tasty
and
refreshing
with
its
slightly
dominant
vinegar
note
in
scent
its
only
major
drawback
the
rating
below
comes
from
multiple
bottles
over
a
period
of
several
years
pours
a
clear
reddish
to
plum
brown
or

a

of

some

backed
by

a

very

it
has
a
taste
that
sharply
distinguishes
itself
form
other
beers
meant
to
be
drunk
in
small
quantities
as
it
tastes
like
red
wine
not
in
huge
gulps
not
really
one
that
is
meant
to
be
brought
into
those
crazy
parties
and
events
to
get
drunk
rather
it
is
an
essential
for
the
beer
connoisseur
overwhelming
vinegar
and
sourness
made
it
difficult
to
drink
the
sour
taste
is
interesting
but
i
really
like
it
all
time
favorite
the
aroma
is
intriguing
with
fruit
and
vinegar
tart
slightly
acidic
taste
but
fruity
and
bold
great
belgian
sour
red
definitely
enjoyed
having
this
on
draft
it
does
not
taste
like
wolf
pussy
o
this
is
my
second
sour
beer
didnt
enjoy
the
first
one
but
this
one
is
a
lot
better
the
sour
vinegar
aromas
and
flavors
turned
me
off
at
first
but
then
i
notice
there
is
some
subtle
cherry
berry
aromas
and
flavors
in
the
beer
highly
recommend
if
youre
into
sours
and
will
definitely
drink
again
o
i
have
been
wary
of
flanders
reds
as
well
as
lambics
and
saisons
although
in
the
last
category
i
have
had
a
few
exceptionally
fine
ones
because
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
sours
and
have
had
a
bad
drain
pour
experience
or
two
with
them
but
this
is
like
an
elegant
strong
hard
fruit
cider
looks
great
and
tastes
healthy
while
rivetiting
your
attention
on
the
flavor
damn
near
a
perfect
flanders
red
o
again
the
style
is
not
my
favorite
but
i
can
guess
this
is
true
to
the
style
guidelines
appearance
was
very
nice
smell
ended
up
being
nice
the
flavor
just
okay
for
me
serving
type
bottle
reddish
brown
in
color
smells
like
apple
ciderbalsamic
vinegar
mouth
feel
is
quite
pleasant
crisp
and
highly
carbonated
taste
is
like
an
aged
balsamic
vinegar
with
hints
of
apple
cider
vinegar
and
a
touch
of
grape
well
balanced
sweet
and
sour
notes
my
favorite
of
the
flemish
red
ales
a
little
vinegary
but
pretty
good
overall
cherry
oak
more
vinegary
than
sour
tasty
this
poured
12oz
bottle
a
deep
reddishbrown
into
my
snifter
there
were
very
small
bubbles
and
a
soda
pop
like
carbonation
which
quickly
disappated
the
aromas
of
red
wine
vinegar
were
very
dominant
and
with
some
concentration
a
bit
of
oak
was
also
there
this
was
quite
tart
on
the
palate
and
i
am
pretty
new
to
sours
lots
of
dark
cherry
notes
and
a
bit
of
the
vinegary
note
on
the
back
end
very
nice
actually
a
rich
smooth
mouthfeel
that
coated
the
palate
and
hung
around
for
a
spell
overall
this
beer
was
far
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
while
i
enjoyed
the
components
taste
appearance
etc
as
a
whole
this
was
one
of
the
phemomenal
beer
experiences
that
i
have
enjoyed
will
seek
out
again
as
well
as
dig
further
into
the
style
definitely
an
acidity
to
the
main
sour
note
and
the
oak
is
very
present
as
well
along
with
some
peach
and
other
dark
fruit
head
was
a
little
foamy
for
my
liking
v
good
value
available
in
a
single
bomber
and
a
four
pack
of
bottles
maybe
this
isnt
for
me
i
thought
it
tasted
just
like
vinegar
not
good
from
a
bomber
as
my
bier
waitress
noted
this
is
supposedly
a
red
ale
but
its
deep
brown
with
a
reddishcrimson
tinge
never
seen
a
beer
look
this
cool
has
a
short
beige
head
that
leaves
small
amounts
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
incredible
smells
of
red
wine
belgian
yeast
malts
cherries
plums
roasted
sugars
the
taste
is
outstanding
it
is
sweet
and
tangy
but
that
is
a
over
simplification
reminiscent
of
a
framoise
the
beer
is
tangy
and
sweet
but
not
a
fruity
sweetness
more
of
a
light
yeast
and
wheat
and
grains
sweetness
the
beer
is
incredibly
balanced
there
is
no
resistance
i
could
down
this
whole
body
without
fail
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
want
to
savor
it
it
is
full
bodied
but
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
but
is
complimented
by
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
overall
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
sure
it
was
expensive
but
i
wont
come
by
a
beer
like
this
in
a
long
time
a
bottle
from
2009
and
may
well
be
past
its
prime
flat
thin
and
sour
upon
first
pour
it
opened
up
nicely
after
standing
with
uch
of
the
sour
flavor
that
dominated
the
first
sip
dissipated
some
nice
complexity
remained
and
a
nice
belgian
red
still
wait
in
the
bottle
smells
extremely
sour
and
vinegary
however
the
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
the
smell
indicates
initially
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
experienced
this
is
my
first
sour
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
definitely
purchase
it
again
very
refreshing
complex
i
will
have
to
experiment
more
with
this
style
love
sours
this
tasted
like
vinegar
only
everything
went
as
expected
with
this
beer
until
the
taste
i
wont
lie
it
was
maybe
too
sweet
for
my
personal
expectations
but
damned
if
i
didnt
drink
every
drop
unapologetically
sweet
but
still
complex
it
was
almost
like
a
red
champagne
or
one
of
those
sparkling
juices
for
wagonriders
would
drink
again
but
i
want
an
aged
one
next
time
to
see
how
that
sweetness
sours
up
i
generally
dont
like
sour
belgian
beers
but
this
one
was
exceptional
literally
deep
fruity
and
complex
a
delicious
dependable
sour
pours
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
acidity
sour
tart
cherries
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
malt
complexity
brown
sugar
underneath
slight
vinegar
just
delicious
o
slightly
sweeter
than
jacobins
making
it
slightly
less
drinkable
great
starter
sour
not
overly
sour
or
bitter
very
light
refreshing
beer
sour
definitely
not
tart
subtle
maple
sweetness
on
the
end
wham
bam
absolutely
magical
it
feels
like
fairies
are
dancing
on
your
tongue
i
had
this
both
ondraft
at
a
great
bar
in
philly
and
also
out
of
the
bottle
very
great
it
is
a
little
sour
but
also
fruity
and
sweet
loved
it
try
it
for
sure
liked
the
taste
of
this
beer
one
to
slowly
enjoy
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
i
had
tasted
this
beer
before
but
did
not
remember
it
looking
back
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
remember
tasting
pure
vinegar
it
was
bad
and
disappointing
however
it
incidentally
as
i
said
before
it
got
a
second
chance
to
make
a
first
impression
and
im
glad
it
did
i
was
while
writing
this
review
initially
questioning
whether
this
beer
had
a
purpose
when
placed
next
to
abt
12
on
draft
seeing
as
they
are
very
similar
i
have
concluded
that
there
is
a
place
for
both
of
these
in
your
glass
when
you
cant
afford
to
be
knocked
on
your
ass
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
abt
12
since
its
lower
in
alcohol
additionally
there
is
a
subtle
difference
in
flavor
that
is
enough
to
justify
this
beers
existence
very
satisfied
overall
tastes
like
worcestershire
sauce
and
vinegar
would
make
a
good
marinade
i
dont
know
how
people
come
up
with
tart
berries
or
plums
but
to
each
there
own
aromas
of
balsamic
vinegar
and
dark
fruit
i
get
a
lot
of
vinegar
in
the
taste
but
just
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
plum
and
grape
flavors
mouthfeel
is
soft
but
well
carbonated
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
much
more
complex
than
i
had
anticipated
love
this
beer
forever
love
her
sour
temperamental
funky
fresh
bierasse
ahmazing
i
cant
smell
anything
aside
from
sweaty
concert
goers
so
well
have
to
discount
that
aspect
so
good
o
i
love
this
one
so
much
depth
and
some
much
to
take
in
if
i
would
have
known
how
much
i
liked
this
i
would
have
gone
straight
for
the
750
ml
guess
ill
have
to
go
back
really
a
great
beer
experience
overall
a
very
tasty
refreshing
fun
beer
id
like
just
a
tiny
bit
less
carb
but
other
than
that
its
fantastic
o
not
that
big
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
there
were
no
better
options
available
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
3
5
tart
with
sour
apple
and
cherry
flavors
emerging
after
initial
taste
the
sort
of
sourness
you
feel
in
your
jaw
initial
flavor
and
smell
is
almost
vinegar
in
its
sharpness
and
astringency
very
interesting
pours
dark
hazelbrown
with
a
tan
head
that
traces
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
sour
fruit
like
cherries
as
well
as
a
little
vinegar
the
taste
was
heavy
sour
in
the
beginning
with
cherries
and
raspberry
flavors
which
then
mellowed
and
came
back
for
a
heavy
finish
very
tasty
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
syrupy
but
it
worked
for
the
style
very
impressive
would
highly
recommend
o
i
appreciate
the
complexity
in
flavor
of
the
beer
but
for
my
tastes
it
is
overly
sweet
i
enjoy
a
more
tart
flanders
red
rather
than
fullbodied
sweet
flanders
overall
it
was
a
nice
drink
the
appearance
has
a
crystal
clarity
and
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
thin
yet
always
present
light
tan
head
to
the
nose
there
is
wine
like
light
vinegary
aroma
with
no
hop
presence
the
mouth
feel
is
effervescent
and
there
is
a
tartness
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
that
doesnt
have
the
dramatic
pucker
of
some
sours
there
seems
to
be
an
almost
oakey
middle
with
a
sweet
finish
overall
nicely
balanced
rba
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
experienced
takes
the
experience
to
a
new
different
level
well
worth
trying
this
is
a
flat
out
wonderful
beer
unique
and
delicious
so
delicious
drink
it
now
or
later
just
drink
it
pours
a
clear
redbrown
one
finger
of
dense
cream
colored
foam
delicate
islands
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
overripe
apricot
quite
oaky
with
herbal
notes
taste
tart
nectarine
fruity
sweet
acidic
combo
as
in
pineapple
juice
white
flesh
plum
craisins
and
cherry
juice
towards
the
finish
sweet
fruit
quite
tart
with
plenty
of
oak
character
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
syrupy
with
a
sugary
finish
tasty
if
not
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
very
similar
to
wine
goes
perfect
with
steak
overall
a
really
excellent
brew
impressive
layers
shine
throughout
and
venture
into
deep
depths
of
complexity
the
finish
is
surprisingly
crisp
yet
refreshing
which
keeps
the
drinker
coming
back
for
more
overall
this
is
quite
good
the
red
wine
similarities
are
evident
but
i
prefer
this
to
a
wine
duh
its
beer
its
not
a
soulless
drink
the
sour
notes
are
in
great
balance
with
the
dark
fruits
and
the
medium
carbonation
makes
this
all
the
more
palatable
at
6
its
quite
easy
drinking
will
seek
out
again
i
personally
love
the
taste
and
this
is
currently
my
favorite
beer
this
fell
short
really
only
on
the
level
of
sour
for
me
every
other
profile
that
the
flemish
red
ale
is
famous
for
this
one
has
the
deep
red
color
the
tart
aroma
the
cherries
in
the
flavor
excellent
cloudy
ruby
red
pour
with
a
beige
onefinger
head
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
vinegar
and
oak
wine
barrels
very
tart
dark
fruit
flavor
upfront
can
taste
maraschino
cherries
blackberry
and
light
plum
finishes
slightly
sweet
with
a
slight
tartness
that
fades
fairly
quickly
o
glad
that
i
broadened
my
horizons
with
this
one
its
a
really
well
rounded
drinking
experience
overall
i
think
i
am
in
love
highly
recomended
delicious
pours
a
brilliant
amber
with
a
frothy
beige
head
tart
cherry
and
acetic
acid
open
the
aroma
with
toasted
oak
and
vinous
qualities
adding
complexity
flavor
is
very
acetic
with
toasted
barrel
drying
out
the
finish
tart
cherries
and
balsamic
vinegar
are
evident
puckeringly
sour
with
cherry
lingering
in
the
finish
slightly
spicy
phenolic
aftertaste
though
its
a
great
bargain
at
13
a
bottle
duchesse
ran
into
the
same
issue
as
many
craft
beers
despite
being
one
of
my
favorites
not
five
years
ago
the
last
few
years
have
been
much
sweeter
and
has
lost
that
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
get
back
to
your
roots
duchesse
we
miss
you
already
an
excellent
sour
very
typical
of
the
style
the
sourness
gives
a
refreshing
tang
this
was
one
of
those
beers
that
i
always
eyed
when
i
saw
it
but
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
overly
yeasty
belgians
i
always
stayed
away
figured
id
give
this
a
shot
after
looking
into
it
and
finding
out
that
it
was
a
sour
its
definitely
one
of
those
beers
to
experience
pretty
unique
combination
of
stuff
going
on
if
you
like
lambics
sours
its
definitely
for
you
if
not
you
will
probably
not
enjoy
this
tart
and
complex
loads
of
fruit
and
phenol
some
elegant
vinegar
and
tasty
soil
if
you
like
your
sour
more
than
unidimensional
which
seems
to
be
the
trend
this
is
the
beer
deep
brown
with
tartness
that
can
still
come
off
a
little
sweet
flavors
are
melded
but
all
play
the
same
part
in
a
rich
symphony
if
you
like
dry
wines
this
will
probably
hit
the
spot
i
will
retry
after
a
year
or
so
wow
this
is
a
clean
and
powerful
tasting
sour
and
one
of
the
best
you
can
get
everyday
o
one
of
my
favorite
brews
in
north
texas
price
ranges
between
35bottle
and
id
say
its
well
worth
the
cost
on
the
few
occasions
i
have
been
able
to
find
the
larger
bottles
shaped
like
the
apollinaris
volume
like
a
bomber
i
snatch
up
as
many
bottles
as
i
can
carry
worth
the
money
every
time
pours
dark
red
almost
brown
with
short
but
persistent
tan
head
smell
is
complex
and
satisfying
sour
cherries
fig
molasses
and
a
red
wine
vinegar
tartness
taste
after
you
get
over
the
initial
sweetness
is
sour
cherries
some
wood
and
maybe
apple
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
pretty
dry
finish
overall
i
like
it
its
obviously
a
quality
brew
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
my
favorite
flanders
wish
it
was
a
tad
more
on
the
sour
side
o
will
continue
to
explore
the
land
of
the
unknown
sours
this
one
is
pretty
solid
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
the
highlights
o
first
time
with
this
classic
sour
and
im
glad
i
finally
picked
one
up
sours
are
growing
on
me
and
i
cant
say
i
mind
that
overall
4
255
duchesse
is
a
very
good
belgian
sour
that
gets
a
lot
right
it
has
a
great
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
an
excellent
nose
and
looks
very
nice
in
the
glass
i
do
wish
it
featured
better
carbonation
for
sure
but
that
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
beers
overall
quality
very
good
and
i
concur
with
others
on
ba
that
this
is
a
good
introductory
sour
o
this
is
a
great
flanders
sweet
sour
and
very
well
balanced
the
perfect
beginner
sour
oyay
very
good
more
complex
than
rodenbach
classic
with
a
good
wallop
of
tartness
to
keep
sour
fans
happy
a
good
starter
belgian
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
o
mostly
mentioned
above
but
this
seems
like
a
soured
up
barleywine
or
a
tart
semidry
wine
smells
vingary
at
first
great
follow
kombychka
like
awesome
beer
if
i
could
brew
beers
at
hone
i
would
give
thus
shit
a
shot
you
need
a
deserni
g
palate
for
this
shiz
give
it
a
whirl
trying
yo
make
a
250
word
review
and
all
i
can
say
is
you
gotta
try
this
shiz
not
annormal
beer
o
i
love
this
beer
i
grab
it
biweekly
at
a
bottle
shop
30
minutes
away
overall
great
in
all
other
aspects
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
the
taste
theres
some
nice
complexity
there
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
distracting
if
the
sweetness
were
turned
down
and
the
sournessacidity
turned
up
a
bit
this
would
be
excellent
its
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
regular
flanders
red
fix
just
stick
to
rodenbach
grand
cru
o
great
sour
beer
not
overpowering
clean
taste
sour
at
the
end
hangs
on
a
bit
will
buy
again
overall
just
wonderful
a
very
intense
sour
beer
compared
to
the
handful
ive
tried
big
earthy
almost
grassy
aroma
hints
of
alcohol
some
cherry
just
a
hint
of
sour
mold
flavor
has
lot
of
green
apple
and
cherry
reminds
me
of
a
jolly
rancher
drinks
really
smooth
and
clean
and
coats
the
mouth
well
poured
on
tap
into
a
10
oz
tulip
glass
a
very
deep
red
with
almost
no
light
transparency
and
a
creamy
off
white
inch
head
it
has
a
very
red
wine
like
nose
with
the
bitter
sweetness
this
is
my
first
sour
so
i
cant
judge
too
much
but
it
has
a
good
sour
sweet
wine
taste
like
a
dessert
wine
or
something
it
has
a
crisp
mouth
feel
with
a
moist
finish
overall
quite
nice
for
my
first
sour
it
was
aged
and
cellared
by
my
local
beer
shoppe
and
i
was
lucky
to
try
it
o
outstanding
beer
overall
it
doesnt
get
too
much
better
than
this
balanced
complex
and
refreshing
clean
finish
you
get
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
lot
of
drink
ability
the
duchesse
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
overall
lots
of
fruity
sweetness
but
tastefully
held
back
by
the
nice
funkyness
acidic
bite
and
pleasant
barrel
notes
the
comparisons
to
red
wine
make
sense
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
an
older
bottle
to
see
if
the
sweetness
takes
a
step
back
to
more
acidicsour
notes
o
great
mildly
tart
beer
o
an
outstanding
belgian
sour
the
fruit
flavors
are
amazing
beautiful
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
flavors
like
eating
a
fresh
bowl
of
fruit
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
if
youve
never
had
flemish
red
or
sour
then
this
is
a
good
introduction
theres
definitely
ones
that
are
heavy
on
the
sour
side
but
not
this
one
a
great
blend
of
sweet
and
sour
and
a
lot
of
depth
to
the
taste
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
also
strong
on
tap
at
global
brew
smells
of
sour
fruit
vinegar
earth
deep
ruby
color
with
an
inch
thick
head
flavors
of
red
wine
wood
sour
cherry
subtle
funk
finishes
clean
a
very
approachable
sour
and
a
good
place
to
start
if
youre
just
getting
in
to
them
ooverall
great
first
sour
ale
and
flanders
must
try
more
o
truly
incredible
if
you
want
to
try
an
amazing
sour
red
ale
and
you
are
willing
to
dish
out
some
cash
look
no
further
i
for
one
can
say
i
will
be
taking
the
wallet
hit
again
in
the
near
future
to
experience
what
this
beer
has
to
offer
overall
even
though
this
beer
is
honestly
like
nothing
else
ive
ever
had
it
still
remains
one
of
my
favorites
its
complex
yet
very
easy
to
drink
fullbodied
and
fun
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
to
try
something
truly
new
flanders
redbrown
ales
never
fail
to
impress
and
satisfy
me
and
this
is
no
exception
exceptionally
delicate
and
nuanced
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
should
be
accessible
and
drinkable
even
to
sour
novices
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
will
have
to
try
more
of
this
style
i
recommend
this
though
something
tells
me
others
in
the
style
are
less
sweet
and
more
sour
i
still
dug
it
nice
looking
beer
pours
auburn
with
pillowy
offwhite
head
cherry
red
lifesaver
with
vinegar
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
aroma
is
melted
sour
apple
slurpee
and
red
vines
not
sure
why
this
beer
gets
so
much
love
get
some
cuvee
de
jacobins
fellas
o
by
far
my
least
favourite
flemish
red
way
too
sweet
nothing
refreshing
very
little
balancer
just
sweet
cherries
overall
4
25
this
beer
is
amazing
complex
balanced
and
utterly
enjoyable
if
you
have
never
had
a
flanders
red
i
would
recommend
you
try
this
one
it
reminded
me
of
a
lambic
but
perhaps
how
a
lambic
would
taste
without
the
delicious
fruit
additives
what
you
get
is
an
equally
excellent
beer
maybe
even
better
in
some
respects
notably
the
bouquet
sour
and
just
all
around
excellent
o
tasty
flanders
red
that
has
an
interesting
sweet
sour
mix
going
on
bottled
poured
in
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
brownish
red
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
lingers
around
for
quite
some
time
it
has
a
strong
aroma
of
fruits
tarts
and
some
wine
characteristics
it
has
a
strong
taste
of
fruits
such
as
cherry
and
some
melon
it
is
very
palatable
it
is
an
amazing
beer
overall
overall
good
to
really
good
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
like
most
of
the
beers
in
its
style
but
is
still
quite
enjoyable
a
must
try
as
it
adds
breadth
to
the
style
i
would
buy
again
this
beer
has
a
mouthfeel
that
is
intricate
and
complex
and
delightfully
light
it
enlivens
the
palate
and
the
senses
it
drinks
so
easily
and
with
so
much
character
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
are
intertwined
and
cannot
be
separated
the
textures
and
the
delightful
and
playful
complexity
brings
forward
fruit
in
both
its
extremes
sweet
and
tart
lush
headdy
intoxicating
overall
a
very
good
sour
beer
nice
and
enjoyable
from
beginning
to
end
note
buy
this
in
the
big
bottle
for
the
corkage
experience
i
dont
know
if
this
contributes
to
the
experience
but
the
bottle
art
is
far
better
than
the
small
bottles
o
definitely
a
classic
great
flavor
profiles
and
complexity
very
enjoyable
flanders
beer
wow
really
had
what
i
look
for
in
a
sour
dark
fruit
tartness
and
strong
sour
acidity
after
the
first
few
sips
i
could
really
get
all
the
tropical
fruit
tang
although
every
few
sips
i
do
catch
a
whiff
of
a
solvent
like
alcohol
flavor
especially
on
the
back
on
my
palate
but
overall
a
amazing
beer
great
for
satisfying
a
sour
crave
o
well
like
i
stated
above
this
was
my
first
of
this
style
so
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
it
i
would
probably
try
it
again
im
normally
a
stoutporter
type
but
this
is
defiantly
a
interesting
style
with
lots
of
flavor
and
mouth
zing
lol
i
probably
rated
it
lower
than
it
should
be
but
that
more
to
my
mouth
being
in
shock
prost
this
is
surprisingly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
surprising
since
i
dont
particularly
like
light
watery
carbonated
sweet
beers
highly
recommended
for
seasoned
beer
drinkers
and
newbies
alike
abro
wrote
i
must
pause
for
a
moment
and
thank
the
beer
gods
top
of
my
list
an
art
performance
i
agree
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
very
difficult
style
to
perfect
in
fact
only
the
examples
from
rodenbach
are
clearly
superior
with
all
due
respect
to
attempts
from
the
u
s
i
know
american
wild
ales
do
not
count
as
they
are
their
own
special
substyle
none
of
them
compete
with
the
flemish
originals
where
i
live
the
price
for
this
beer
varies
dramatically
so
i
suggest
shopping
around
for
a
good
price
pours
dark
red
with
medium
head
that
disappears
quickly
with
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smells
like
tart
cherries
beautiful
bit
of
vinegar
heavy
sour
here
taste
is
tart
cherries
uckering
on
the
palate
bit
of
a
dry
woody
oak
finish
crisp
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
really
enjoyable
though
a
bit
pricy
overall
this
ones
a
little
on
the
fruitysugary
sweet
side
i
prefer
rodenbach
or
cuvée
des
jacobins
rouge
but
its
been
about
3
years
since
ive
had
this
one
so
im
glad
i
decided
to
give
it
another
go
clearly
a
well
crafted
beer
just
not
my
personal
favorite
representation
of
the
style
o
my
first
sour
and
i
like
it
a
lot
little
bit
different
but
very
good
overall
excellent
sour
ale
with
strong
fruity
feel
fresh
and
enjoyable
to
drink
o
this
is
my
first
beer
in
this
style
so
im
not
entirely
sure
of
what
to
think
of
it
all
i
know
is
what
ive
written
and
that
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
its
a
really
fantastic
beer
it
does
not
have
huge
huge
characteristics
but
its
a
wonderful
beginner
sour
or
for
those
who
like
red
wine
however
for
beer
lovers
it
still
is
a
really
well
rounded
and
delicious
drinking
beer
for
the
price
i
guess
my
expectations
were
high
as
one
could
tell
i
thought
this
was
toot
candy
sweet
i
did
find
it
an
enjoyable
and
like
i
say
every
brew
has
its
place
pours
a
barely
translucent
shade
of
reddish
brown
with
a
sodalike
head
very
nice
fairly
high
carbonation
level
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
vinegar
cherries
port
wine
a
mossy
type
of
earthiness
and
rosemary
herbs
i
love
the
nice
tart
flavor
which
contains
essences
of
cranberry
raisin
currants
caramel
apples
citrus
funky
belgian
yeast
and
fresh
red
grapes
its
nice
and
light
going
down
easily
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
its
got
a
juicy
finish
which
leaves
the
drinker
wanting
more
overall
this
beer
is
simply
exquisite
a
fantastic
sour
that
every
beer
advocate
must
try
o
a
perfect
well
made
sour
great
for
an
introduction
to
sour
ales
as
well
a
great
easy
access
sour
for
that
hot
day
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
years
this
was
a
small
bottle
probably
split
up
from
a
duchesse
gift
pack
insert
sound
effect
here
but
now
i
suppose
i
need
to
get
some
of
these
to
age
as
this
greatly
exceeded
my
expectations
i
have
had
a
handful
of
harder
to
get
more
expensive
flanders
reds
and
this
is
really
among
the
best
i
have
ever
had
seriously
its
expensive
but
worth
it
give
it
a
shot
my
absolute
favorite
sour
i
explain
it
to
guests
in
laymans
terms
its
like
red
wine
cider
and
beer
got
together
and
created
a
new
beer
it
changes
as
you
drink
it
too
delicious
a
really
good
sour
ale
that
mixes
some
fruity
sweetness
in
for
great
effect
delicious
and
enjoyable
to
drink
definitely
going
to
look
for
this
again
o
nice
beer
but
not
to
sour
maybe
i
was
just
expecting
much
more
poured
into
a
pint
glass
seriously
this
is
why
im
a
fan
of
wild
yeast
this
beer
is
very
unique
honestly
im
a
much
bigger
fan
of
this
than
rodenbach
definitely
worth
a
try
or
two
overall
wow
was
this
a
surprise
and
glad
the
bar
tender
referred
it
after
their
local
beers
were
out
this
beer
is
great
o
im
still
a
novice
when
it
cones
to
flanders
but
this
is
probably
the
best
i
have
had
to
date
the
flavors
marry
perfectly
and
the
mouthfeel
is
orgasmic
in
having
trouble
findings
flaws
this
is
sure
to
be
a
go
to
for
this
style
cheers
overall
a
really
great
belgian
style
sour
ale
nice
balance
of
sour
tart
and
fruity
would
definitely
buy
again
duchesse
de
bourgogne
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
color
with
very
little
head
there
is
a
wine
like
aroma
with
sour
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
much
the
same
sour
grape
flavors
sweeter
similar
to
a
wine
full
flavors
and
nice
body
still
a
nice
beer
to
sip
overall
a
very
nice
sour
ale
poured
from
a
longneck
bottle
into
a
chalice
dark
deep
mahogany
colored
with
medium
head
formation
the
aroma
can
be
smelled
right
away
no
need
to
sniff
the
glass
a
complex
blend
of
acidic
notes
that
brings
out
shoyu
balsamic
vinegar
and
grapes
the
taste
is
incredibly
different
and
at
first
i
did
not
like
it
it
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
grows
with
each
sip
after
you
get
used
to
it
the
flavor
gets
really
interesting
and
very
complex
it
is
kind
of
in
between
a
beer
and
a
red
wine
with
that
vinegar
thing
always
in
the
background
amazing
classy
drink
overall
havent
had
too
many
sours
to
me
this
tastes
more
like
champagne
than
a
beer
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
mean
really
enjoyed
this
even
thought
its
insanely
expensive
i
will
be
purchasing
this
many
times
again
and
curious
to
try
other
flemish
sours
ive
yet
to
have
a
less
than
mediocre
beer
from
belgium
any
style
they
know
what
theyre
doing
this
is
a
full
bodied
slightly
complex
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
the
statements
are
correct
that
this
indeed
is
a
nice
flanders
red
intro
medium
bodied
a
touch
heavier
than
you
may
expect
for
a
sour
ale
with
heavier
carbonation
as
well
and
a
slick
almost
oily
mouth
feel
duchesse
de
bourgogne
is
a
decent
way
to
soothe
your
apprehensive
friends
into
accepting
the
world
of
sour
beers
for
people
who
are
already
deep
into
that
territory
this
beer
wont
be
too
exciting
for
you
so
hopefully
you
can
see
it
for
what
it
is
a
mild
mannered
bridge
into
a
whole
different
type
of
beer
just
starting
to
get
intotry
sour
beers
and
from
i
understand
this
is
a
legend
pours
a
dark
dark
ruby
red
nice
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smell
dark
fruit
banana
not
really
picking
up
anything
sour
on
the
nose
but
smells
amazing
ooohhh
theres
the
sour
lol
its
all
over
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
tart
sour
cherry
some
of
the
funky
taste
i
recognize
from
beers
with
brett
but
not
nearly
as
pronounced
this
is
very
nicely
balanced
wont
be
an
every
day
beer
for
me
because
of
the
price
point
but
ill
be
back
for
more
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
bought
it
but
didnt
look
into
it
before
buying
it
is
very
good
but
not
a
style
im
a
big
fan
of
overall
filling
relaxing
fascinating
jubilant
you
know
when
i
start
using
adjectives
that
personify
a
beer
that
i
absolutely
love
it
could
be
my
new
favorite
dont
tell
my
husband
but
i
might
be
in
love
balsamic
vinegar
cherry
fairly
sweet
and
tart
slightly
soy
sauce
finish
of
tartness
and
rich
fruit
lasts
longer
than
expected
and
a
musty
taste
is
eventually
left
behind
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
quite
nice
if
you
like
vinegar
fairly
complex
750
ml
bottle
pours
brown
with
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
vinegar
caramel
brown
sugar
plums
and
alcohol
body
is
full
and
tangy
taste
is
of
barnyard
yeast
cherries
plums
caramel
vinegar
and
brown
sugar
finish
is
long
sweet
and
sour
amazingly
delicious
brew
o
if
anything
this
is
something
of
a
middle
ground
between
lindemans
sugar
bombs
and
a
proper
sour
ale
the
sugary
sweetness
is
quite
prevalent
yet
it
doesnt
overpower
the
tart
qualities
i
can
see
this
being
very
approachable
to
sour
ale
beginners
the
alcohol
wasnt
that
strong
in
this
either
and
even
though
i
only
bought
one
bottle
i
could
have
downed
quite
a
few
in
a
sitting
very
beers
are
this
smooth
and
accessible
while
not
being
overly
strong
tart
or
sour
but
this
straddled
the
edge
of
those
quite
well
i
couldnt
taste
the
balsamic
vinegar
here
and
there
wasnt
any
spice
either
so
if
youre
new
to
this
get
it
and
give
a
go
i
cant
imagine
anyone
not
liking
this
beer
its
hard
to
relate
the
taste
to
a
beer
so
much
port
flavor
sherry
sweetness
and
just
the
right
amount
of
tart
this
is
like
drinking
a
fermented
grape
based
liquor
with
low
alcohol
very
smooth
lots
of
crisp
carbonation
to
help
it
down
this
is
very
different
from
expectation
overall
probably
a
good
beginners
sour
drinks
like
a
tart
cherry
juice
with
just
a
bit
of
that
funky
sourness
nice
underlying
sweetness
ive
had
this
several
times
before
and
im
not
really
sure
how
ive
never
sat
down
and
reviewed
it
a
classic
brew
that
i
doubt
will
ever
go
out
of
style
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
makes
me
feel
like
i
should
be
dressing
up
and
pairing
it
with
a
cigar
its
easily
the
tastiest
sour
ive
had
to
date
and
a
new
favorite
id
score
it
even
higher
if
it
didnt
smell
so
odd
overall
impression
a
truly
different
sort
of
flanders
red
primary
driven
by
its
brett
yeast
character
and
subsequent
musty
barnyard
flavors
berry
fruitiness
plays
in
the
background
as
well
as
malt
sweetness
hops
round
out
but
are
not
noticed
in
flavor
or
aroma
o
better
than
i
had
expected
crisp
and
refreshing
pours
a
dark
amberishbrown
with
a
nice
big
beige
head
aroma
is
smoothly
sweet
and
tart
some
brown
sugar
ssome
fruits
such
as
dark
cherries
plum
raisins
some
vinegar
flavor
was
pretty
much
the
same
a
lighter
mouthfeel
to
this
worked
well
for
the
style
overall
a
wonderful
beer
really
a
classic
in
the
realm
of
flanders
reds
and
perhaps
sour
beers
in
general
this
was
the
very
first
sour
i
had
years
ago
in
my
initial
craft
findings
and
i
remember
not
minding
the
astringency
as
the
fruitiness
and
bready
yeasty
texture
were
both
so
predominant
in
the
flavor
overall
its
not
as
complex
as
other
beers
in
its
realm
but
it
terms
of
widespread
availability
and
accessibility
its
definitely
made
its
mark
this
is
a
great
one
to
use
to
introduce
people
to
soured
beers
tart
fruity
slightly
nutty
and
very
refreshing
o
yummy
sour
brew
love
it
pretty
good
im
growing
accustomed
to
the
style
i
appreciate
the
complexity
and
wealth
of
flavors
i
am
just
starting
to
experiment
with
sours
so
my
frame
of
reference
for
this
style
is
not
as
big
as
with
other
styles
the
beer
has
a
dark
brickred
color
with
a
wispy
head
nose
was
vinegary
although
not
unpleasant
taste
not
as
sour
as
the
nose
would
make
you
think
it
would
be
and
it
finished
with
cherries
and
a
little
caramel
sweetness
i
knew
i
was
going
to
like
this
and
i
like
it
more
now
than
i
did
when
i
tried
it
in
the
beer
class
bravo
to
brouwerij
verhaeghe
this
is
the
only
bottle
from
them
on
our
list
i
wonder
what
other
beers
they
produce
has
anyone
tried
anything
else
from
them
oh
well
this
one
is
good
enough
for
me
to
buy
over
and
over
again
cheers
overall
a
very
nice
sour
that
is
extremely
drinkable
and
very
tasty
one
of
the
most
balanced
and
enjoyable
sours
i
have
ever
had
o
an
enjoyable
beer
that
exceeded
my
expectations
beautiful
chestnut
colored
body
with
a
small
creamy
pillow
of
a
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
plush
bubbly
ring
oaky
balsamic
sharpness
first
hits
the
nose
along
with
sour
cherry
berries
caramel
and
dusty
red
wine
big
sour
wellrounded
flavors
like
sweet
acidic
fruit
tart
cherry
wood
light
tannins
dry
and
puckering
this
takes
me
back
less
vinegary
than
i
remember
excellent
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
more
candy
than
beer
its
not
something
youd
drink
fast
as
the
flavors
are
so
complex
you
want
to
savor
every
sip
it
is
honestly
the
most
different
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
i
am
just
getting
into
the
sours
realm
and
this
is
just
delicious
good
stuff
a
unique
and
fascinating
flavour
blend
that
no
other
style
can
match
though
i
suppose
lambics
come
close
simultaneously
sweet
and
sour
the
aroma
and
flavour
exhibit
fruity
notes
most
reminiscent
of
balsamic
vinegar
it
looks
nice
and
the
body
is
pretty
good
while
i
dont
mind
flemish
reds
i
do
find
them
rather
cloying
this
is
not
a
brew
i
would
have
twice
in
a
row
having
said
that
it
is
a
exemplary
take
on
the
style
one
to
add
to
your
musttry
list
o
great
sour
o
yum
such
a
rich
delicious
sweet
beer
excellent
think
i
liked
roedenbach
better
though
doesnt
feel
like
there
were
as
deep
of
a
flavor
o
awesome
great
rep
of
the
style
the
mix
of
tartynesssweetness
is
perfect
i
could
drink
this
all
day
o
i
feel
that
this
is
slightly
better
than
rodenbach
grand
cru
a
very
good
entry
sour
which
is
what
i
am
into
right
now
good
stuff
overall
this
is
candy
not
beer
the
duchesse
is
one
fine
lady
o
a
quality
beer
but
not
something
id
drink
often
poured
into
a
tulip
deep
dark
plum
color
with
a
beige
head
the
aroma
is
unique
sour
fruit
but
a
bit
medicinal
fruity
sweet
and
tart
cherries
ripe
grapes
with
a
mild
sour
sting
on
the
end
medium
carbonation
and
overall
mouthfeel
an
excellent
and
well
blended
sour
ale
that
doesnt
overpower
750
ml

into
tulip
glass
best
before

crystal
clear
dark

with

with

to

that
lingers

is
very
well

with
zero

after

overall
this
is
an
excellent
flanders
red
ale
very
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
the
taste
ah
really
a
thing
of
beauty
in
fact
if
i
were
to
introduce
somebody
to
sours
this
is
likely
what
id
give
them
that
is
not
necessarily
because
its
a
beginner
beer
persay
but
because
it
has
such
a
wonderful
balance
to
it
that
some
other
sours
really
just
dont
have
while
some
sours
are
like
drinking
straight
vinegar
this
has
more
complexity
and
balance
to
it
which
makes
it
an
incredibly
easy
drink
i
get
a
nice
sweet
fruitiness
perhaps
of
cherries
predominately
and
maybe
a
hint
of
cranberry
in
there
upfront
along
with
a
lactic
tartness
that
id
describe
as
perhaps
half
as
sour
as
many
of
the
new
sours
ive
had
that
i
think
are
going
out
of
their
way
to
be
as
sour
as
possible
again
easy
going
never
makes
me
grimace
always
whets
my
palate
for
the
next
drink
that
mix
between
the
sweet
berriescherries
and
the
lactic
tartness
is
so
well
done
i
really
cant
say
enough
nice
just
not
so
interesting
extreme
well
balanced
beer
combining
drinkability
with
flavor
not
too
sour
perfect
level
unless
you
dig
a
lot
sour
beers
excellent
i
am
now
curious
to
try
it
even
more
aged
i
have
the
impression
will
continue
to
evolve
drinkability
a
very
good
sour
goes
down
very
easily
although
it
is
only
6
o
really
excellent
sour
will
absolutely
return
to
this
i
could
see
this
aging
exceptionally
well
i
love
this
beer
it
has
a
pleasant
sour
fruit
smell
of
cherries
cranberry
and
raspberry
taste
is
quite
similar
has
a
slight
bready
and
sour
fruit
aftertaste
that
blends
well
look
is
beautiful
bright
ruby
red
in
a
glass
which
i
absolutely
adore
one
of
my
favourites
atm
o
simple
complex
and
extremely
refreshing
its
a
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
this
beer
is
outstanding
if
only
it
wasnt
so
expensive
o
very
enjoyable
and
complex
flavors
swirl
and
emerge
and
play
around
on
tongue
and
cheeks
had
on
tap
in
a
squat
tulip
glass
at
osdh
in
a
presidents
day
special
for
fdr
o
ive
never
had
this
one
tap
before
its
quite
tasty
and
an
easy
drink
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
doesnt
rise
to
the
complexity
of
other
sours
still
i
will
enjoy
more
in
the
future
o
too
sweet
and
sour
to
have
more
than
maybe
2
of
these
but
the
one
is
very
good
i
would
certainly
drink
it
but
for
8
i
will
not
order
this
again
unless
its
for
a
desert
beer
this
would
be
perfect
but
this
one
was
certainly
a
pleasure
to
have
overall
drinkability
a
very
interesting
full
flavor
beer
full
of
contrasts
but
balanced
and
not
overpowering
despite
being
sour
complimented
a
fullflavor
dinner
chicken
40
cloves
very
nicely
and
was
good
to
savor
after
the
meal
a
very
nice
beer
overall
but
for
me
a
one
and
done
its
good
but
one
glass
is
enough
another
bottle
or
another
glass
would
be
too
much
one
per
evening
is
enough
i
could
easily
have
this
again
though
just
not
in
one
sitting
an
absolutely
incredible
beer
the
balance
of
fruit
floral
and
sour
is
incredible
usually
a
beer
this
sweet
would
be
way
out
of
my
zone
but
the
balance
of
the
sour
accentuates
the
fruit
and
floral
notes
love
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
anyone
who
has
not
ventured
into
the
land
of
sours
should
make
this
one
of
their
first
o
love
this
beer
certainly
up
there
in
my
favourites
the
best
of
the
sour
reds
ive
had
its
balanced
for
a
sour
and
complex
keeps
me
wanting
more
o
although
not
as
bold
as
some
sours
its
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
satisfying
this
beer
is
pretty
unique
in
its
flavor
profiles
and
its
quality
is
undeniable
always
a
joy
a
very
excellent
beer
hard
to
find
faults
here
and
its
really
tasty
as
far
as
the
take
on
the
style
it
isnt
as
in
your
face
sour
as
others
and
seems
to
have
a
more
balanced
approach
and
flavour
with
a
slight
roast
malt
sweetness
on
the
palate
that
brings
it
all
together
really
well
a
great
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavour
worth
trying
i
am
not
the
most
eloquent
or
well
versed
on
such
beers
this
is
just
mighty
tasty
flanders
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ridiculously
delicious
and
satisfying
while
i
have
lots
of
love
for
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
the
cuvee
de
jacobins
rouge
and
this
would
compare
closer
to
the
cuvee
it
offers
me
what
the
other
do
not
a
much
more
lipsmacking
berrynectary
intensity
but
not
overbearing
sugary
sweetness
this
wouldnt
be
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
i
revel
in
the
excitement
and
anticipation
though
each
time
we
cross
paths
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
but
ive
had
other
flanders
ales
that
were
better
and
most
importantly
more
sour
the
sourness
is
what
i
love
about
the
style
and
duchesse
de
bourgogne
doesnt
deliver
quite
as
well
as
others
even
the
bext
most
prevalant
flanders
rodenbachs
grand
cru
does
so
youre
not
going
too
far
out
of
your
way
to
get
that
extra
goodness
i
feel
like
im
underscoring
a
bit
but
for
the
price
im
going
to
make
sure
i
reach
for
rodenback
over
this
every
time
i
wouldnt
pop
it
for
my
lil
soldierettes
quinceañera
but
just
to
get
freaky
yep
this
isnt
rodenbock
but
this
is
a
must
try
and
the
beer
is
priced
extremely
well
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
an
amazing
flavor
would
love
to
drink
this
all
the
time
odisclosure
years
ago
this
was
one
of
the
first
sour
beers
i
ever
had
so
im
sure
there
is
some
nostalgia
coming
in
here
anyway
i
really
enjoy
the
duchesse
in
particular
i
could
smell
this
beer
all
day
long
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
the
feel
was
merely
good
not
great
so
perhaps
this
beer
lacks
the
balance
and
complexity
of
the
best
sour
red
ales
rodenbach
grand
cru
for
example
but
the
duchesse
is
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
definitely
a
win
i
will
definitely
add
this
beer
to
my
rotation
of
belgians
as
it
deserves
no
less
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
good
one
at
that
but
very
different
from
you
average
beer
this
is
much
more
vinious
and
tart
that
nearly
all
beer
styles
out
there
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
complexity
of
flavor
and
the
unique
balance
of
sweetness
to
even
out
the
classic
puckering
tartness
from
the
moment
of
the
pour
we
knew
things
would
go
well
with
this
one
the
coloring
glowed
and
the
head
stood
tall
and
strong
the
aroma
gave
us
a
lighter
hint
of
the
excellent
mash
of
flavors
within
which
alone
would
have
you
coming
back
for
more
the
feel
only
builds
this
desire
as
there
is
nice
frothy
slurp
to
each
sip
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
all
around
very
well
balanced
ill
be
buying
this
again
o
slightly
above
average
here
as
this
beer
needs
some
time
to
become
more
rounded
overall
it
through
me
a
curve
ball
but
in
a
good
way
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
it
itwas
just
like
red
wine
i
want
to
try
this
with
steak
or
lamb
chops
sometime
in
the
future
an
a
rated
beer
for
sure
a
bit
all
over
the
board
but
recommended
a
nice
well
distributed
sour
relaxing
and
unique
for
a
friday
after
a
busy
week
overall
a
tasty
but
not
over
the
top
complex
brew
it
would
make
a
good
introduction
into
the
expansive
world
of
wild
belgian
beers
a
good
flanders
red
but
ive
definitely
had
better
i
did
find
it
pleasant
however
o
absolutely
fantastic
this
is
my
first
flanders
red
a
fantastic
sour
overall
i
guess
i
am
just
new
to
this
style
but
i
was
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
tartsweet
taste
i
am
waiting
for
a
headache
to
kick
in
from
the
sugar
oh
the
dutchess
shall
i
compare
the
to
a
summers
day
seriously
though
this
beer
is
phenomenal
for
one
expecting
a
good
sour
ale
this
beer
cannot
be
beat
though
potentially
tied
i
got
exactly
what
i
expected
and
would
not
wish
for
this
beer
to
change
at
all
i
hope
to
be
able
to
share
this
beer
with
my
children
when
they
are
old
enough
of
course
at
least
not
until
they
hit
double
digits
thanks
to
all
those
flemish
folks
for
this
amazing
contribution
to
the

lactic

the

off
with
a
touch

sweetness
this
is
quickly
countered
with
a
healthy
dose

by

not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
duchesse
de
bourgogne
has
confirmed
something
to
me
that
i
seem
to
have
experienced
a
few
times
already
beer
is
art
cheers
overall
bottle
or
draft
you
cant
go
wrong
such
a
cornerstone
of
a
beer
for
this
style
the
vinegar
smell
actually
fit
well
and
thankfully
didnt
transfer
into
the
taste
top
shelf
here
an
excellent
allaround
drink
o
a
different
outcome
than
expected
of
this
beer
something
i
could
sit
and
have
with
a
home
cooked
meal
for
sure
but
not
something
to
have
more
than
one
bottle
of
i
feel
loving
the
woody
characters
arising
and
as
always
the
dark
fruits
recommend
to
try
o
a
very
nice
beer
great
fruit
notes
but
still
has
some
malty
and
hoppy
notes
i
would
recommend
it
well
made
beer
and
nicely
complex
without
being
a
flavour
bomb
overall
this
was
weird
but
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
try
again
a
very
slow
sipper
for
me
o
a
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
sour
this
one
is
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
would
buy
a
balsamic
flavored
cola
this
ones
for
you
excellent
beer
o
a
very
nice
and
tasty
beer
good
complexity
true
to
style
and
very
well
made
well
worth
the
money
and
quite
enjoyable

would
drink
this
one

duchesse

pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
with
a
few
scant
ruby
highlights
apparent
when
the
beer
is
backlit
theres
a
smattering
of
khaki
colored
foam
atop
the
beer
not
enough
for
any
real
lacing
or
head
retention
though
the
nose
is
very
nice
with
aromas
of
sweet
cherry
acidic
tartness
and
a
bit
of
woody
oak
all
intermingling
and
taking
turns
standing
out
the
flavor
profile
manages
to
be
even
more
complex
cherries
and
a
definite
vinous
sour
note
are
what
immediately
make
an
impression
the
farther
i
get
down
the
glass
the
more
some
of
background
notes
begin
to
come
through
in
addition
to
the
oak
some
biscuit
and
light
caramel
maltiness
add
another
layer
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
to
the
same
level
as
the
aroma
and
flavor
tje
body
is
alright
but
the
carbonation
dies
off
at
the
front
of
the
palate
leaving
the
rest
of
the
sip
to
coat
my
palate
a
little
too
much
still
duchesse
is
a
great
beer
and
im
almost
embarrassed
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
o
super
refreshing
and
delicious
quite
enjoyable
and
a
solid
brew
for
the
style
overall
an
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
which
could
do
with
less
sweetness

nothing
about
this
beer

forced

artificial
its
cohesive
while
being
incredibly
dynamic
one
of
the
best
flemish
style
beers
ive
had
enjoyable
would
have
been
a
much
better
beer
without
that
buttery
slickness
but
worth
buying
a
few
more
before
they
disappear
to
see
how
it
evolves
pours
a
deep
medium
brown
with
a
dense
beige
head
that
leaves
tremendous
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasant
but
muted
with
a
faint
mustyherbal
hop
character
that
is
reminiscent
of
old
wet
grass
in
a
good
way
which
is
contrasted
by
a
light
fruity
combination
of
berries
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
more
vibrant
with
a
bright
and
fruity
combination
of
mixed
berries
and
sour
cherries
that
is
not
overly
sweet
especially
when
cut
by
a
kind
of
aged
vinegar
character
the
fine
soft
carbonation
elevates
rather
than
distracts
from
the
sweettart
flavor
overall
the
sweet
and
only
gently
sour
profile
of
this
beer
makes
it
quite
drinkable
but
still
flavorful
o
very
refreshing
drink
featuring
a
good
complexity
and
a
perfect
balance
definitely
a
must
try
o
the
metallic
flavor
ruined
it
for
me
to
the
point
where
i
couldnt
finish
it
i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
one
i
had
high
hopes
and
it
fell
flat
i
will
try
it
again
but
this
one
just
did
not
hold
up
to
its
reputation

its
definitely

i
remember
it
being
from

thought
the

i
enjoyed
this
beer
on
draft
at
the
muddy
pig
in

the
waiter
delivered
the
stemmed
glass
of
mahogany
colored

the
aroma
immediately
made
itself
known
the
fruity
woody
funky
mixture
elicited
pleasant
memories
of
the
good
side
of
worchestire
sauce
without
losing
its
beer
distinctness
the
flavor
expands
on
the
palate
into
a
fruity
cherrylike
sour
oakladen
profile
filled
with
complexity
the
waves
keep
coming
all
complementing
the

bottom
line
very
good
interesting
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
down
side
is
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
multiple
beers
at
a
time
if
you
like
belgium
beers
and
flemish
ales
this
is
right
up
your
alley
outstanding
example
of
how
complex
beer
can
be
enjoy
this
at
least
once
for
sure
o
pretty
shocked
to
find
a
sour
i
liked
would
drink
again
overall
wildly
complex
impeccably
balanced
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
and
funk
just
phenomenal
o
better
than
expected
very
drinable
first
flanders
red
ale
and
it
was
a
pleasant
experience
cannot
believe
i
only
have
the
one
bottle
makes
me
sad
ive
always
been
intrigued
by
this
style
and
feel
i
have
now
found
its
standard
and
it
is
good
overall
wow
very
solid
flanders
red
it
is
nice
that
the
sour
is
not
lip
puckering
but
instead
smooth
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
the
nose
is
quite
tart
but
the
taste
is
well
balanced
very
good
amount
of
fruit
i
really
enjoyed
this
still
something
id
love
to
have
anytime
but
for
6
a
bottle
i
dunno
im
hoping
to
enjoy
the
lost
abbeys
red
poppy
a
little
more
at
15
a
bottle
as
for
the
taste
woah
baby
this
lady
has
class
theres
a
slight
candysweetness
up
front
that
is
balanced
by
a
refreshing
sour
apple
acidity
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfirm
and
silky
smooth
the
carbonation
seems
just
right
im
no
expert
of
flanders
red
ales
but
this
one
is
a
freaking
work
of
art
its
not
a
mouthpuckeringly
acidic
as
rodenbach
grand
cru
the
pleasant
sweetness
that
accompanies
the
flavor
makes
this
much
much
more
drinkable
i
think
i
might
actually
prefer
it
fairly
full
body
and
creamy
given
how
light
it
tastes
the
taste
is
the
perfect
balance
between
sweet
sour
with
incredible
drinkability
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
acidic
this
beer
is
right
on
par
with
a
good
flanders
red
and
is
less
sweet
than
a
monks
cafe
and
less
fruity
than
a
rodenbach
long
into
the
aftertaste
a
malt
graininess
settles
in
which
is
also
an
unexpected
feature
of
this
beer
overall
this
beer
will
make
a
wine
lover
extol
its
complexity
and
a
nonbeer
drinker
relish
in
its
drinkability
definitely
good
to
drink
in
great
quantity
highly
recommended
and
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
style
a
o
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
my
youth
when
i
would
eat
a
roll
of
shocktarts
or
a
bag
of
sour
patch
kids
the
only
downside
which
might
be
a
plus
budgetwise
is
i
cant
have
more
than
1
of
these
in
a
sitting
will
buy
a
4pack
of
this
next
time
instead
of
a
single
bottle
also
really
like
to
see
a
long
bestby
date
printed
on
the
bottle
a
very
tasty
beer
and
id
imagine
a
good
example
of
the
style
price
is
a
little
much
but
it
could
be
nice
treat
every
once
in
a
while
o
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
only
gave
it
4s
because
it
lacked
some
funkiness
but
still
has
that
slight
vinegaress
taste
will
definitely
get
this
again
o
wow
im
fairly
new
to
the
style
but
i
can
tell
im
a
big
fan
of
flanders
reds
nothing
like
a
nice
complex
beer
to
finish
the
day
doa
i
havent
fully
delved
in
to
the
world
of
sours
but
i
have
had
this
one
numerous
times
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
that
is
totally
ofirst
flanders
red
i
like
it
a
lot
pours
a
ruby
redbrown
with
about
one
finger
of
head
smells
like
tart
cherries
tastes
like
balsamic
vinegar
with
cherries
but
in
a
good
way
its
crisp
with
a
medium
body
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
tart
and
bitter
that
makes
my
mouth
pucker
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
o
loved
it
assertive
smooth
and
sour
mashup
looking
forward
to
trying
more
brown
ales
o
at
first
the
finish
didnt
work
for
me
but
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
accustomed
i
got
to
it
by
the
time
i
reached
the
end
it
was
a
pretty
pleasant
flanders
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
reddish
copper
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
plenty
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
vinegar
and
sour
fruit
perhaps
cherry
or
apple
its
funky
the
flavor
is
tart
up
front
with
plenty
of
carbonation
i
can
taste
some
apple
flavor
the
sour
flavor
isnt
overwhelming
and
plays
well
with
the
carbonation
the
flavors
are
definitely
interesting
but
in
a
good
way
its
medium
bodied
with
proper
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
this
is
a
sipper
due
to
the
tartness
but
its
an
easy
sipper
overall
id
rate
this
an
excellent
beer
overall
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
i
plan
on
having
it
again
its
currently
my
favorite
sour
despite
the
steak
sauce
sensation
i
was
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
the
off
putting
taste
keeps
it
well
short
of
being
great
o
this
beer
was
my
first
ever
sour
and
while
it
was
certainly
an
eyeopening
experience
i
still
enjoyed
getting
to
try
a
new
beer
within
an
unfamilar
style
even
with
the
knowledge
of
what
i
was
about
to
drink
i
was
still
startled
by
the
amount
of
sourvinegar
taste
in
this
beer
that
said
with
each
sip
my
mouth
started
to
adjust
to
the
tartness
and
the
beer
surprisingly
became
pretty
addicitve
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
beer
like
this
too
often
but
am
now
looking
forward
to
giving
a
few
more
sours
a
try
in
the
future
incredible
beer
and
highly
recommended
for
belgian
lovers
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
a
beer
i
pay
fullprice
for
and
know
im
getting
a
treat
every
time
great
fresh
great
with
a
few
years
on
it
an
amazing
flanders
red
5

as
sour
beers
arent
really
my
cup
this
one
surprised
me
in
being
more
than
quite
enjoyable
it
is
light
fruity
and
pleasant
it
is
rather
inoffensive
and
likely
a
good
start
for
introducing
people
to
beers
with
a
more
sour
side
to
them
overall
great
stuff
maybe
just
a
little
sweet
but
tastes
gooood
medium
bodied
with
excessive
carbonation
this
beer
fizzes
like
alka
seltzer
in
dr
pepper
the
body
is
full
enough
to
allow
the
flavors
to
not
only
register
on
the
taste
buds
but
to
stick
around
for
a
good
bit
as
well
however
the
body
never
becomes
sticky
or
coating
thanks
to
the
effervescent
carbonation
despite
all
the
fizzing
the
carbonation
really
doesnt
detract
from
the
experience
much
and
really
helps
to
keep
this
beer
really
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
bold
ruby
red
with
no
head
but
long
lasting
lace
its
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
musty
hay
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
mainly
sour
cherries
with
a
yeasty
breadlike
note
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
warming
finish
duchesse
de
bourgogne
is
an
okay
beer
very
filling
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
slightly
recommended
o
i
do
not
care
for
this
beer
too
much
im
a
big
fan
of
other
flanders
but
this
one
does
not
do
it
for
me
dont
think
that
i
will
be
having
this
again
o
i
like
every
other
factor
of
this
beer
but
the
final
taste
too
bad
because
everything
else
is
going
well
for
it
very
good
sour
one
of
my
favorites
in
fact
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
stays
around
but
no
lacing
cherries
raspberries
and
balsamic
vinegar
on
the
nose
flavor
begins
with
a
sour
kick
of
cherries
grape
juice
red
wine
and
mellowed
vinegar
not
too
tart
or
puckering
hints
of
sweet
raspberries
lemon
juice
and
sour
apples
near
the
finish
just
a
touch
of
wood
as
well
nice
balance
simple
mix
of
flavors
that
work
very
well
together
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
champagne
like
it
literally
disappears
on
the
tongue
with
rich
malt
and
complex
fruit
and
spice
on
the
palate
the
sweet
and
sour
of
beers
the
duchesse
has
a
nice
balance
but
its
not
the
tops
of
the
style
a
good
entrylevel
flanders
red
this
one
poured
with
a
quick
disappearing
head
and
a
brownishred
hue
smelled
of
candied
cherries
and
booze
some
scents
of
sweet
red
wine
comes
through
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
pungent
but
super
sweet
cherries
and
sugar
with
grapes
and
red
wine
a
bit
too
sweet
imo
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
dry
liked
this
but
could
have
been
a
little
more
tartsour
to
make
it
awesome
o
yes
its
quite
tart
and
does
very
little
to
quench
my
thirst
but
after
your
palate
gets
acquainted
with
those
tastes
its
very
wellbalanced
i
dont
usually
get
into
sours
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
every
once
in
a
while
hats
off
to
the
duchesse
overall
i
am
rating
this
beer
high
because
in
its
class
i
havent
had
too
many
that
would
touch
it
that
said
you
definitely
should
know
what
you
are
getting
into
and
be
in
the
mood
for
a
tart
fruity
treat
that
you
can
only
find
with
ddb
overall
a
terrific
beer
pretty
remarkable
the
range
of
flavours
going
on
here
and
well
they
all
work
together
very
tasty
and
also
a
great
beer
to
introduce
others
to
sour
beers
o
nice
and
complex
with
wonderful
tart
and
sour
fruit
flavors
extremely
enjoyable
and
a
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
i
might
just
have
to
go
out
and
purchase
a
couple
more
of
these
to
keep
in
the
fridge
highly
recommend
two
finger
rapidly
dissipating
head
with
a
little
lace
on
a
clear
near
perfectly
amber
body
near
perfect
sour
cherry
aroma
with
candy
notes
flavor
is
initially
sour
then
sweet
in
the
finish
with
a
predominantly
dark
fruit
backbone
this
beer
is
excellent
and
very
very
drinkable
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
best
by
mar
2013
poured
a
redish
murky
brown
excess
proteins
contributed
to
a
chill
haze
smell
of
abundant
fruit
such
as
apple
pear
currant
and
soft
bready
yeast
tastaste
is
overwhelmingly
cider
like
very
unlike
a
lambic
or
other
sour
beers
this
is
more
of
a
sweet
and
kinda
sour
expierence
mouthfeel
was
light
yet
a
bit
syrupy
and
carbonation
was
minimal
and
head
was
not
around
for
more
than
10
seconds
overall
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
my
cup
of
beer
and
would
probabaly
not
revisit
i
will
say
though
this
is
a
grow
on
you
type
of
flavor
o
anytime
i
see
this
beer
i
get
it
ive
paid
too
much
for
it
but
thats
the
cost
of
mixing
two
batches
together
and
aging
and
importing
and
the
rarity
and
on
and
on
and
on
great
stuff
overall
a
near
perfect
flanders
i
cant
give
it
a
perfect
5
because
that
belongs
to
consecration
only
problem
i
can
find
with
this
burgundy
beauty
is
so
noble
dignified
and
vinous
it
might
destroy
the
wine
industry
if
it
caught
on
i
try
not
throw
out
a
high
score
without
justification
but
i
dont
know
how
this
beer
can
be
improved
for
what
it
is
i
find
the
look
lightness
and
taste
spot
on
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
all
night
but
used
in
place
of
a
dessert
wine
or
a
sweet
treat
look
no
further
98
o
a
very
sweet
fruity
beer
with
a
touch
of
funk
o
an
interesting
beer
far
too
vinegary
i
was
recommended
this
beer
multiple
times
as
an
introduction
to
sours
but
its
simply
not
my
thing
if
there
was
fruit
it
was
that
raisin
and
plum
thing
as
if
it
were
made
with
tea
sorry
i
just
dont
see
what
the
fuss
about
this
one
is
o
nice
beer
im
newer
to
sourwildetc
and
this
one
had
nice
tastes
that
complimented
each
other
nicely
t
pretty
delicious
sweet
and
tart
with
big
rich
fruity
notes
and
a
pretty
good
dose
of
funk
on
the
finish
lots
of
red
apples
and
caramel
with
some
plum
and
vanilla
very
very
drinkable
overall
my
first
real
dive
into
a
beer
that
is
tart
and
sour
and
while
it
certainly
isnt
unpleasant
its
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
again
however
it
has
not
turned
me
off
from
trying
different
sours
as
it
isnt
disgusting
by
any
means
my
first
beer
of
this
style
pours
a
beautifuly
dark
red
with
a
nice
sized
head
recedes
quickly
to
leave
some
good
lacing
on
the
sides
and
surface
smell
is
tart
with
some
mild
fruit
notes
kind
of
like
a
fruit
lambic
taste
is
tart
to
begin
spicy
throughout
rich
earthy
yeastiness
in
the
finish
red
wine
there
is
a
great
background
sweetness
that
makes
this
very
nicely
balanced
really
tasty
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
very
easily
drinkable
overall
i
really
like
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
actually
will
have
to
seek
out
some
more
examples
of
this
style
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
ubiquitous
but
i
prefer
the
rodenbachs
o
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
its
a
world
class
brew
and
a
unique
sour
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
the
duchesse
must
be
courted
notes
what
dam
tasty
beer
i
am
glad
i
bought
this
one
and
will
buy
it
again
cheers
o
very
good
beer
my
first
sour
highly
enjoyable
love
love
love
this
beer
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
sweeter
styles
but
the
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
make
this
beer
fantastic
my
only
problem
with
it
is
its
metallic
aroma
with
a
hint
of
metallic
in
the
finish
very
pleasant
effervescent
mouthfeel
have
only
come
across
this
once
on
draft
which
is
definitely
better
than
in
the
bottle
o
flemish
sour
beers
are
always
unique
and
interesting
this
one
is
no
exception
o
pretty
decent
sour
the
metallic
flavor
isnt
really
off
but
it
would
be
nice
if
it
wasnt
there
o
very
refreshing
and
bloody
delicious
o
very
fruity
and
berry
almost
reminded
me
of
a
wine
cooler
but
good
and
more
body
o
still
impressed
my
favorite
flanders
lots
of
funk
good
level
of
acetic
acid
complex
drinkable
touch
of
oak
overall
i
know
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
standard
for
the
style
but
i
did
not
find
a
depth
of
flavor
and
i
did
not
much
care
for
the
very
sweet
flavor
it
did
have
not
a
fan
but
it
was
interesting
to
try
this
was
my
first
flanders
red
ale
so
nothing
else
to
compare
to
o
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
the
tap
ran
out
at
the
local
bar
and
my
heart
broke
thankfully
i
have
bottles
available
when
i
can
get
some
more
petty
cash
buy
this
beer
drink
it
savor
it
and
share
it
with
me
just
delicious
and
probably
the
best
example
of
how
my
taste
has
changed
over
time
at
one
time
i
found
this
beer
barely
drinkable
as
it
was
just
too
sour
for
me
now
i
think
the
level
of
sour
in
this
beer
is
just
right
and
sometimes
think
it
borders
on
being
too
sweet
regardless
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
with
an
amazing
amount
of
flavor
given
the
6
abv
this
is
the
beer
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
flanders
red
ale
future
outlook
i
should
be
drinking
flanders
beers
more
often
with
this
one
certainly
included
d
really
solid
flanders
i
have
passed
over
this
beer
too
many
times
in
the
past
and
will
not
make
that
mistake
as
much
as
i
have
i
dont
know
how
to
beat
this
in
this
style
radiating
a
deep
brownamber
hue
the
ale
was
served
in
flute
glass
with
an
inch
head
a
fruitysour
aroma
tickled
the
nose
without
much
effort
the
aroma
was
quite
potent
as
with
most
good
sour
ales
the
taste
was
potent
a
sour
fruitness
was
the
immediate
impression
this
included
hints
of
tart
cranberry
and
raspberry
the
sensations
continued
into
the
tart
and
fruity
aftertaste
the
carbonation
was
a
little
more
aggressive
than
i
would
have
expected
but
this
did
not
subtract
from
the
experience
duchesse
is
a
delicious
and
refreshing
experience
a
very
invigorating
and
well
balanced
flemish
red
ale
this
was
beer
1000
here
at
beeradvocate
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
found
that
with
the
tartness
one
was
enough
quite
the
beer
belgium
keeps
impressing
me
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
sip
on
if
you
have
friends
that
are
into
red
semi
sweet
or
dry
wines
they
might
really
enjoy
this
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
one
damn
good
bier
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
ive
had
it
many
times
but
never
really
tried
to
break
down
the
flavors
and
aromas
before
it
is
unbelievable
how
much
flavor
they
pack
into
a
6
2
abv
beer
worldclass
overall
excellent
one
of
the
best
belgians
i
have
had
overall
its
a
solid
drink
with
exceptional
drinkability
incredibly
smooth
as
well
id
definitely
pick
it
up
at
least
once
considering
its
from
belgium
the
prices
isnt
too
high
either
conclusion
this
is
my
first
flanders
red
ale
but
will
definitely
not
be
my
last
hopefully
others
can
stand
up
to
this
one
incredible
stuff
o
i
think
this
beer
surprised
me
at
every
step
great
balance
in
this
little
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
brownishred
a
thick
sticky
deeptan
head
smell
is
tart
yet
with
some
malt
heaviness
taste
is
puckering
but
more
sweet
than
sour
lots
of
cidery
apple
and
tart
cherries
sourdough
malts
feel
is
very
nice
with
some
body
yet
sparkling
and
effervescent
a
tasty
complex
brew
o
a
tasty
ale
and
the
first
of
the
style
i
have
tried
unique
would
be
an
understatement
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
doverall
i
was
not
expecting
this
brew
to
taste
this
good
it
had
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
and
sweet
fruit
flavors
and
a
nice
bitter
funk
to
it
i
love
this
brew
and
will
get
it
again
i
see
why
this
is
5
a
bottle
alittle
steep
but
for
a
brew
this
good
ill
pay
it
def
pick
this
up
if
u
can
or
trade
for
it
o
a
flanders
red
is
always
an
interesting
beer
this
is
no
exception
o
terrific
i
am
enthusiastic
about
this
ones
uniqueness
i
like
the
surprise
of
the
sweetness
after
the
funky
aroma
i
like
watching
the
bubbles
which
are
still
going
i
like
that
this
beer
has
strong
opinions
about
itself
and
is
not
afraid
to
share
them
overall
this
flanders
red
ale
is
an
interesting
intersection
of
a
sour
ale
and
barleywine
traits
i
liken
it
to
a
barleywine
light
that
has
similar
complexitiy
of
flavors
without
the
heaviness
or
maltiness
of
a
barleywine
one
can
definitely
appreciate
why
this
is
regarded
as
the
burgundy
of
belgium
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
great
place
to
start
with
sours
the
taste
amazed
me
so
much
going
on
but
nothing
became
muddled
o
a
nice
beer
for
a
sour
one
i
would
even
say
its
worth
buying
pours
a
brownred
color
w
a
nice
one
finger
cocoa
head
amazing
carbonation
and
lacing
lacing
sticks
around
forever
and
would
probably
be
on
my
glass
tomorrow
if
i
didnt
wash
it
beautiful
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
although
you
cant
see
through
it
at
all
nose
is
cherry
yeast
sourness
funk
and
some
vinegar
very
nice
balance
on
the
nose
and
nothings
overwhelming
taste
is
amazingly
smooth
for
what
i
was
expecting
there
is
some
sourness
cherry
funk
but
theres
also
a
malt
smoothness
to
it
that
offsets
the
others
a
little
bit
really
nice
feel
as
well
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
its
a
good
intro
beer
for
sours
and
this
style
as
well
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
cheers
light
amber
with
significant
garnet
highlights
goodly
number
of
carbonation
streams
rising
from
center
bottom
of
glass
off
white
head
a
good
fingers
worth
relatively
slow
dissipation
with
significant
lacing
nose
is
pretty
sweet
for
the
style
cherry
and
grape
little
hops
if
any
in
the
aroma
the
yeast
is
fairly
noticeable
and
dries
out
the
fruitiness
taste
once
again
is
pretty
sweet
minimal
tartness
not
a
lot
of
sourness
balanced
well
by
sweetness
no
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
ok
effervescence
some
residual
stickiness
really
tasty
perhaps
a
better
entry
flanders
than
some
of
the
more
tart
or
sour
entries
in
any
case
very
tasty
not
your
typical
sour
overly
infused
with
sour
cherry
and
rotten
harvest
fermentation
surprisingly
mellow
with
its
dark
pour
piquant
and
satisfying
pairs
well
with
smoked
cheeses
amd
pickled
beets
quick
in
the
mouth
and
somehow
ancient
4pack
night
is
worthy
cheers
o
i
have
been
on
a
sour
kick
as
of
recent
and
the
complexity
of
this
one
really
blew
me
away
there
is
so
much
going
on
but
is
so
well
constructed
that
you
get
to
enjoy
every
piece
individually
and
as
a
whole
with
each
sip
man
did
this
go
great
with
dinner
o
really
enjoyable
sour
not
as
sour
as
many
but
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
for
those
interested
in
sour
beers
drink
exquisite
beer
or
fancy
soda
indeed
this
is
a
beer
and
quite
an
impressive
one
but
there
isnt
nearly
enough
tart
to
balance
the
sweetness
for
me
very
drinkable
almost
dangerously
so
do
drinkability
is
moderately
low
im
disappointed
that
after
the
relatively
strong
first
impressions
this
beer
just
falls
off
quick
for
me
way
too
much
vinegar
not
enough
tartness
and
the
vegetal
notes
in
the
finish
are
brutal
i
had
this
at
a
bar
tasting
about
a
year
ago
and
it
was
my
first
sour
i
thought
it
was
pretty
decent
then
but
it
was
just
a
small
sample
and
i
guess
my
palate
has
developed
a
taste
for
different
types
of
sours
since
then
o
a
typical
b
if
you
ask
me
nice
but
there
are
better
beers
in
this
style
d
high
drinkability
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
nice
beer
will
have
this
one
again
o
great
beer
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
pie
turns
out
flavorful
tart
delicious
overall
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
near
perfect
introduction
to
the
world
of
sour
beers
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
just
make
sure
you
drink
it
fairly
fresh
once
it
reaches
or
passes
the
best
before
date
its
a
vinegar
bomb
a
great
introductory
beer
for
the
style
especially
for
someone
who
may
prefer
sweeter
beers
but
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
personal
likings
overall
this
beer
is
unique
prob
wont
pick
it
up
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
the
off
white
head
flutters
away
with
an
afterthought
of
thin
and
scattered
lace
dark
brown
in
color
with
dark
red
hues
at
the
edges
powerful
sweet
and
sour
fruit
aroma
including
prunes
ripe
grapes
figs
and
raisins
along
with
burnt
sugar
and
freshly
baked
brown
bread
and
phenols
vinous
grainy
and
tart
to
the
tongue
with
a
prolific
amount
of
sour
grapes
and
figs
a
little
honey
and
vinegar
are
also
noticed
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
that
is
quickly
forgotten
not
completely
my
thing
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
not
a
good
beer
drinkability
and
overall
impression
throughout
this
beer
i
found
initially
that
it
was
mostly
curiosity
that
motivated
taking
another
sip
but
as
i
adjusted
myself
to
the
flavors
i
was
experiencing
and
as
the
beer
warmed
some
i
began
to
enjoy
it
more
indeed
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
was
ready
to
open
another
given
the
complex
interplay
of
flavors
as
i
was
ready
to
decide
there
was
too
much
sweetness
the
sour
would
come
in
to
play
and
as
i
was
ready
to
decide
there
was
too
much
vinegar
sourness
the
sweetness
would
assert
itself
overall
id
say
this
is
a
beer
that
is
well
worth
trying
im
guessing
that
it
is
not
for
everyone
but
id
recommend
that
everyone
give
it
a
try
but
pay
close
attention
to
serving
temperature
and
have
23
before
reviewing
or
deciding
they
liked
or
disliked
it
the
balsamic
vinegar
flavor
overwhelms
any
other
aspect
of
this
brew
smells
like
wine
fairly
carbonated
very
sour
and
unpleasantly
vinegary
a
total
pass
for
me
though
my
female
companion
liked
it
if
youre
more
into
wine
than
the
typical
belgian
beer
then
maybe
youll
like
it
more
id
rathe
have
a
chimay
or
rochefort
tastes
delicious
sour
sweet
fruit
wine
slight
alcohol
interesting
balance
and
well
done
enjoyed
this
a
ton
definitely
recommend
trying
one
out
overall
a
very
unique
harmonious
and
elegant
beer
that
has
no
evident
flaws
i
think
it
just
surpassed
orval
as
my
favourite
go
to
beer
this
beer
poured
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
trace
of
off
white
fizzy
head
that
retain
and
laces
pretty
well
the
aroma
has
notes
of
sour
cherries
dark
fruit
and
some
vinegar
the
taste
starts
with
the
sour
cherries
and
then
has
a
strong
note
of
vinegar
not
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
on
par
for
what
a
sour
ale
should
be
like
but
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
this
was
way
too
vinegary
for
me
overall
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
is
exceptional
balanced
and
complex
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
best
flemish
reds
ive
tried
i
imagine
this
could
be
a
gateway
beer
for
wine
lovers
and
girlfriends
overall
awesome
beer
nice
switch
from
the
fruity
tart
sours
d
this
was
more
like
apple
cider
vinegar
than
beer
but
it
was
very
clean
and
enjoyable
the
aftertaste
was
mellow
so
it
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
it
could
probably
improve
with
age
but
its
very
enjoyable
fresh
my
first
sour
enjoyed
before
dinner
with
my
wife
and
our
friends
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
lighting
at
falls
taproom
isnt
great
though
head
was
white
and
substantial
smells
a
bit
musty
malty
sweetness
also
and
a
hint
of
vinegar
overall
light
aroma
nothing
overpowering
flavor
was
initially
sweet
and
sour
mostly
sour
and
sort
of
a
balsamic
quality
this
flavor
while
pleasant
departed
quickly
and
the
aftertaste
was
musty
sort
of
like
a
wet
dog
smell
that
lingers
on
the
palate
ive
experienced
this
in
the
past
most
notably
with
arrogant
bastard
and
my
guess
is
that
certain
hops
disagree
with
me
unfortunately
the
aftertaste
is
what
lingered
mouthfeel
was
a
little
sticky
but
light
overall
impression
was
disappointing
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
mouthpuckering
vinegar
experience
i
loves
me
some
deli
pickles
but
the
aftertaste
overwhelmed
the
initial
sour
flavors
this
was
my
first
sour
so
ill
probably
try
it
again
geez
though
theyre
always
so
damn
expensive
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
around
for
a
celebration
o
it
is
thanks
to
this
beer
that
i
like
sours
and
it
is
still
probably
the
one
i
buy
most
often
mouthfeel
didnt
really
register
as
i
didnt
want
in
my
mouth
after
my
tongue
had
gotten
hold
of
it
o
enjoyable
but
subtle
this
beer
has
great
flavors
but
i
wish
they
were
a
little
more
potent
very
easy
drinking
id
drink
it
again
probably
d
too
much
for
me
i
have
several
friends
who
love
this
stuff
and
recommended
it
several
times
but
i
cant
get
on
the
same
page
interesting
brew
but
not
one
for
me
d
to
me
this
has
such
low
drinkability
because
i
want
to
enjoy
it
that
said
its
extremely
drinkable
pours
a
dark
brown
reddish
color
which
when
held
up
to
light
gives
off
a
deep
dark
ruby
red
color
the
beer
is
clear
with
strong
visible
carbonation
and
a
slim
head
nice
lacing
is
left
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
and
hits
you
hard
a
nice
vinegar
smell
rounded
out
by
dark
fruits
sour
cherries
and
plums
the
taste
is
almost
exactly
like
a
champagne
and
white
wine
mix
the
is
a
sour
cherry
tatse
but
also
a
green
sour
apple
and
white
grape
taste
with
a
hint
of
oak
at
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
again
this
beer
has
the
feel
of
champagne
in
your
mouth
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
big
aroma
and
great
taste
o
my
favorite
flanders
red
thus
far
reminds
me
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
even
smoother
sourness
is
nicely
sharp
but
kept
in
check
well
by
oak
aging
sublime
overall
drinkability
this
is
my
first
from
this
style
so
i
was
careful
with
the
ratings
to
leave
room
for
the
possibility
of
a
better
beer
in
style
after
trying
a
few
more
ill
come
back
and
rate
this
one
but
as
a
beer
id
give
it
all
5s
overall
the
only
improvement
i
could
suggest
is
toning
back
the
cherry
a
little
bit
otherwise
its
an
absolutely
superior
brew
o
one
of
the
best
flemish
ales
ive
had
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
it
drinks
really
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
love
this
beer
i
will
seek
this
out
and
drink
this
again
sticky
in
the
mouth
really
clings
to
the
tongue
little
to
no
carbonation
makes
for
smooth
drinking
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
might
actually
be
my
favorite
flanders
red
overall
pretty
good
o
having
this
on
tap
really
caught
me
off
guard
and
made
me
realize
the
dangers
posed
by
getting
this
post
international
shipping
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
already
well
worth
getting
in
a
bottle
getting
it
on
tap
is
a
must
if
its
available
to
you
hats
off
to
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
o
this
really
is
just
a
classic
definitely
one
of
those
beers
you
introduce
to
a
new
drinking
buddy
as
an
introduction
to
sour
styles
the
execution
of
this
flanders
is
so
clean
and
crisp
that
to
dislike
it
is
as
unholy
as
disliking
your
grandmothers
applepie
avoid
such
blasphemies
and
take
your
time
with
this
one
explore
the
different
flavor
experiences
to
be
had
with
different
sized
mouthfuls
notice
how
she
can
be
as
sweet
as
you
want
her
to
be
and
as
tart
as
you
want
her
to
be
revisit
this
one
a
few
times
before
you
come
to
any
conclusions
about
it
each
bottle
is
a
variation
on
a
theme
its
ever
so
sensitive
to
temperature
and
glassware
give
her
the
care
she
needs
after
many
dates
hopefully
youll
come
to
see
her
as
the
beautiful
siren
that
she
is
o
this
is
currently
my
favorite
pick
for
a
sour
beer
and
a
beverage
it
never
lets
me
down
with
its
crispy
tart
holiness
and
mouthwatering
goody
goodness
sometimes
i
wake
up
in
the
night
and
cry
out
for
a
glass
of
duchesse
screaming
until
the
dawn
duchesse
duchesse
it
must
be
tasted
to
be
believed
o
this
went
down
really
smoothly
ive
just
come
off
a
bit
of
a
wild
ale
kick
having
just
had
a
supplication
the
other
night
i
was
expecting
something
heavier
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
was
a
great
beer
after
a
long
day
will
definitely
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
fourpack
pours
dark
crimsonbrown
color
with
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
slight
sour
very
fruity
aroma
wonderfully
balanced
flavor
between
sweet
and
sour
mild
sour
flavors
with
slight
candied
sweetness
excellent
body
seemed
like
a
bigger
beer
loved
it
o
wish
this
one
hadnt
gone
lost
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
i
think
the
lesson
is
that
the
best
before
date
has
a
lot
of
merit
and
dont
age
it
too
long
sorry
to
give
such
a
poor
review
o
id
been
thinking
about
trying
this
for
some
time
but
could
never
pull
the
trigger
thank
goodness
i
did
because
this
is
a
treat
an
exceptionally
good
sour
and
one
i
will
continue
to
by
from
now
on
overall
im
enjoying
this
was
admittedly
a
bit
apprehensive
at
the
outset
but
keeping
an
open
mind
has
paid
off
great
beer
i
am
not
a
sour
chaser
and
i
really
thought
i
would
never
find
a
sour
beer
that
i
really
liked
duchesse
won
me
over
on
the
first
sip
its
complex
flavor
is
completely
masked
by
the
smell
its
like
the
durian
fruit
of
beer
while
im
sure
its
still
not
for
everyone
i
think
if
your
curious
you
should
try
a
glass
o
a
great
beer
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
to
keep
on
hand
when
in
the
mood
for
a
break
from
strong
stouts
bottle
poured
into
a
large
tulip
glass
color
is
a
strong
reddish
brown
with
around
half
an
inch
of
head
smell
is
sour
cider
and
cherry
very
acidic
taste
is
a
kind
of
sweet
and
sour
combination
with
lots
of
grapes
and
maraschino
cherry
flavors
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
very
good
drinkability
this
pours
a
deep
brown
there
are
hints
of
red
but
i
wouldnt
have
known
its
a
red
ale
otherwise
the
head
is
a
finger
width
and
light
brown
it
quickly
fades
away
but
leaves
a
nice
lace
this
smells
a
little
sour
woody
and
slightly
unusual
hard
to
describe
nice
mouth
feel
it
gets
very
carbonated
if
i
gently
move
it
around
on
my
tongue
i
can
feel
the
tartness
the
taste
is
a
little
tart
sour
at
first
but
on
the
way
down
it
seems
to
sweeten
up
quite
a
bit
this
is
definitely
a
unique
flavor
for
beer
but
i
really
like
it
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
shock
tart
candies
i
used
to
love
as
a
child
this
my
second
bottle
to
try
and
the
aftertaste
sweetness
is
more
than
i
remembered
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
well
could
be
one
of
my
favorites
duchesse
may
very
well
be
the
best
sour
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
it
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
notes
of
tart
fruit
notably
cherries
and
dark
malt
since
this
ale
is
aged
in
oak
conditioned
casks
duchesse
has
a
red
wine
like
feeling
to
it
the
array
of
sweet
and
sour
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
throughout
this
flanders
red
ale
and
its
velvety
smooth
from
start
to
finish
not
familiar
but
it
seems
to
repeel
the
wife
and
kids
so
it
is
a
winner
this
ale
poured
out
as
a
fizzy
looking
deep
red
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
and
neither
did
the
lacing
the
color
was
great
on
this
beer
though
the
aroma
of
oak
wood
and
fermented
cherries
on
the
nose
giving
this
quite
a
sour
profile
the
taste
is
exactly
what
the
smell
told
me
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
big
a
powerful
upfront
with
tart
cherry
and
fresh
oak
the
aftertaste
settles
into
a
more
semisweet
and
very
nice
yeasty
cherry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
kind
of
thin
but
didnt
bother
me
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
sours
im
not
really
into
this
style
too
much
but
ill
admit
i
did
enjoy
this
brew
o
excellent
and
very
interesting
beer
often
lambics
are
too
sour
for
me
but
this
style
i
could
get
into
the
texture
of
duchesse
de
bourgogne
is
very
similar
to
that
of
champagne
or
proseccosubstantial
but
airy
thanks
to
the
vigorous
carbonation
release
o
my
first
intro
to
the
flanders
red
ale
as
far
as
i
know
very
solid
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
a
sipper
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
i
could
drink
a
second
one
would
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
overall
as
stated
i
am
no
sour
expert
but
this
is
tasty
if
not
very
complex
single
flavor
going
through
but
a
good
flavor
d
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
call
this
undrinkable
o
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
brew
from
my
typical
ipastoutpale
ales
and
i
couldnt
have
been
more
pleasantly
surprised
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
coming
back
to
revisit
this
one
often
as
well
as
searching
out
more
in
the
style
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
and
a
decent
tan
head
smells
somewhat
funky
with
belgian
dark
malts
malts
reminiscent
of
dubbels
and
quads
hints
of
fruits
cherries
perhaps
ridiculously
sweet
in
the
flavor
and
a
total
shocker
somewhat
sour
but
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
initially
as
i
drink
more
of
it
the
sour
notes
come
through
along
with
some
medicinal
notes
almost
like
cough
syrup
thicker
mouthfeel
than
expected
though
still
mediumbodied
overall
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
the
flavor
profile
is
much
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
i
would
have
preferred
the
sourness
to
be
more
prominent
light
mouthfeel
that
actually
seems
somewhat
creamy
smooth
odd
to
say
for
a
tart
brew
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
excellent
brew
highly
recommend
especially
for
those
who
may
just
be
starting
to
drink
sour
tart
beers
overall
a
pleasant
little
beer
not
too
harsh
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
an
example
where
i
can
recognize
the
high
quality
of
the
beer
but
personally
i
dont
really
like
it
enough
to
repeat
poured
a
3
head
with
a
body
packed
with
tiny
effervescence
gorgeous
deep
clear
reddish
mahogany
body
when
held
up
to
the
light
smell
is
a
touch
sour
but
interesting
has
aspects
of
fruit
and
nail
polish
taste
seems
to
be
a
hibrid
of
lager
cider
and
a
little
pickle
juice
and
although
this
is
technically
not
a
sour
beer
it
was
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
very
nicely
done
product
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
o
ordered
this
beer
randomly
from
a
beer
list
without
know
anything
about
it
ordered
two
more
after
that
o
cant
go
wrong
with
this
this
is
a
love
it
or
hate
it
style
and
i
think
im
a
lover
final
verdict
this
is
one
complex
and
peculiar
little
beer
and
one
which
i
would
love
to
drink
with
pork
and
sauteed
mushrooms
overall
this
one
contributes
to
my
budget
busting
sour
curiosity
and
tastes
great
pours
great
with
a
good
head
i
find
it
best
served
slightly
chilled
or
at
room
temperature
it
has
a
beautiful
color
somewhere
near
a
dark
brownish
red
the
smell
is
simple
and
sweet
and
slightly
sour
smelling
the
taste
is
stunning
passion
fruit
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
are
the
flavors
dominating
very
sweet
with
an
bit
of
an
apple
like
aftertaste
goes
down
smooth
almost
too
smooth
the
alcohol
is
not
present
at
all
this
beer
is
a
great
way
to
finish
the
night
thanks
bro
served
from
bottle
into
a
bells
tulip
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
with
a
slight
light
tan
hue
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
cherries
raspberries
and
subtle
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
sour
tart
subtle
earth
and
raspberries
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
there
is
not
a
lot
you
can
say
bad
about
this
brew
once
upon
a
time
i
saw
this
on
the
closeout
section
at
duckworths
i
drank
the
entire
stock
of
12
oz
bottles
they
had
oops
definitely
has
an
excellent
and
inviting
aroma
going
on
here
and
a
great
flavor
to
go
along
with
that
everything
on
this
one
just
works
really
well
together
a
great
example
of
the
style
if
you
ask
me
an
absolute
must
try
for
any
sour
fan
out
there
if
you
have
not
already
reddish
brown
hue
with
active
bubbles
very
funky
sour
aromas
cherry
and
wood
are
hidden
in
there
flavors
are
very
vinous
and
complex
wet
horse
blanket
and
funk
dominate
over
the
mellow
dark
fruits
and
sour
sweet
finish
very
cool
beer
and
definitely
a
good
standy
sour
mouthfeel
is
very
lush
and
vinous
melts
across
the
tongue
funny
to
see
the
lovehate
thing
going
on
with
this
one
newbies
think
it
taste
like
vinegar
but
those
in
the
know
find
it
delectable
overall
aromas
and
flavors
reminiscent
of
cherries
and
apples
with
some
nice
tart
acidic
qualities
sweetness
light
and
somehow
very
smooth
and
subtle
and
balancing
with
sourness
really
really
enjoyable
sour
a
great
intro
to
this
very
interesting
style
the
tartness
is
present
but
tamed
flavourful
throughout
and
highly
quaffable
mouthfeel
is
ok
at
least
i
think
it
is
im
overwhelmed
by
the
sour
flavour
so
its
hard
to
tell
overall
i
cant
stand
this
beer
but
i
know
its
my
own
dislike
for
the
style
im
sure
its
great
for
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
d
it
is
a
good
beer
fun
to
split
with
someone
but
not
an
all
purpose
beer
i
cant
see
it
being
very
civilized
out
of
doors
not
especially
housebroken
but
a
refined
anemic
purebred
that
is
for
show
and
posterity
only
however
the
fleeting
joy
is
like
a
puppies
feet
upon
your
shins
you
jsut
wouldnt
welcome
4
or
5
in
your
home
for
obvious
reasons
overall
a
great
flanders
red
and
at
10
a
750
in
my
area
it
is
my
regular
go
to
sour
not
super
drinkable
one
and
done
i
prolly
wouldnt
buy
this
again
i
didnt
really
enjoy
the
vinegar
and
the
nuttiness
but
some
good
complexity
an
interesting
elegant
brew
a
bit
too
soury
for
my
own
taste
i
think
its
useful
to
compare
it
with
another
readily
available
sour
the
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
its
lower
gravity
sweetness
and
increased
tartnessbite
really
serves
the
style
in
a
more
palatable
way
but
thats
only
if
youre
part
of
the
mustybitter
camp
like
me
if
youre
sweettoothed
grab
one
of
these
you
probably
will
love
it
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
when
fresh
but
that
really
mellows
with
some
age
and
the
sourness
becomes
more
pronounced
although
still
not
exactly
mouthpuckeringly
sour
nice
balance
here
cherry
fruitiness
and
carmely
malt
blend
together
perfectly
mothfeel
seems
to
thin
out
as
it
ages
but
ill
trade
that
anyday
for
less
sweetness
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
lightly
sour
flemmish
ale
tasty
o
a
beginners
sour
imho
not
as
sweet
as
a
lindemans
by
any
means
good
variety
of
flavors
with
decent
balancing
sourness
sue
liked
it
at
minnesota
town
hall
tap
a
very
drinkable
and
very
soft
flanders
red
but
i
prefer
mine
with
a
more
robust
acidity
and
deeper
complexities
from
oak
and
tannins
still
very
enjoyable
very
easy
to
drink
and
really
very
refreshing
md
good
carbonation
and
not
a
bad
beer
in
the
least
i
would
advise
letting
the
beer
warm
a
bit
because
i
found
it
to
taste
much
better
when
it
warmed
up
the
metallic
flavor
was
gone
still
i
found
it
to
be
too
sweet
even
for
the
style
and
could
have
benefited
from
being
more
on
the
sour
side
on
the
whole
this
is
a
nice
and
drinkable
sourtype
beer
not
overly
tart
but
packs
much
of
the
sour
flavor
profile
that
typically
brings
praise
for
this
type
of
beer
flavorful
and
pretty
wellbalanced
for
me
this
is
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
overall
a
really
unique
beer
great
way
to
introduce
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
to
something
different
ie
my
girlfriend
who
loved
it
cant
wait
to
have
this
for
brunch
i
love
this
beer
it
is
my
new
vice
it
has
removed
me
from
all
of
the
belgian
heffeswhites
p
s
the
artwork
on
the
sticker
is
great
o
i
really
liked
this
it
could
be
a
great
sipper
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
something
too
tart
definitely
a
nice
intro
to
the
world
of
flanders
ales
have
a
red
wine
drinker
try
this
if
you
want
to
convert
them
smell
has
some
sourness
but
not
unpleasant
the
taste
is
like
a
sour
ale
not
my
style
but
reasonable
drinkable
overall
it
tastes
pretty
bad
but
nothing
else
is
overly
off
putting
get
a
rodenbach
instead
a
unique
style
of
beer
and
something
i
think
most
people
could
enjoy
i
think
it
could
be
good
on
a
hot
day
though
not
more
than
one
i
think
it
also
has
a
lot
of
food
pairing
potential
o
if
it
werent
for
the
musky
bitterness
i
think
i
would
have
loved
this
beer
it
was
beautiful
smelled
divine
but
with
that
musky
bitterness
and
how
the
beers
flavor
changed
so
rapidly
during
each
sip
that
it
was
hard
to
relax
and
appreciate
the
subtle
flavors
as
they
slowly
evolve
on
the
pallet
dont
think
i
will
be
getting
another
one
of
these
any
time
soon
but
i
would
certainly
like
to
continue
trying
the
wildsour
beers
that
the
us
and
europe
have
to
offer
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
if
it
had
a
more
refined
sour
taste
it
could
probably
be
world
class
in
my
opinion
taste
is
too
schizophrenic
though
worth
a
drink
though
this
one
poured
a
dark
cherry
brown
in
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
beige
head
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
it
is
ruby
red
like
freshly
stained
wood
this
smells
like
sourdough
vinegar
spoiled
milk
and
cherries
it
instantly
makes
me
think
of
monks
cafe
the
flavor
is
just
ok
you
get
alot
of
sweetness
though
id
say
its
cloyingly
sweet
before
it
goes
into
the
slight
sourness
you
can
actually
pick
of
a
trace
of
alcohol
which
is
very
surprising
considering
its
only
6
2
its
tastes
of
a
mix
of
sweet
fruits
and
condensed
milk
sweet
moses
this
beer
is
sweet
how
do
people
drink
a
750
by
themselves
i
kind
of
like
flanders
red
ales
but
this
beer
is
far
too
sweet
for
me
it
doesnt
help
that
the
sweetness
is
the
prominent
part
of
the
after
taste
its
just
ok
in
my
opinion
i
like
this
the
sourness
doesnt
grate
on
you
through
the
glass
and
its
not
a
beer
that
make
you
pucker
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
i
dont
say
that
about
many
good
sour
beers
poured
from
bottle
best
by
92012
date
stamp
into
tulip
glass
pours
dark
redish
brown
with
a
quickly
discipating
creamy
white
head
initial
aroma
is
sweet
fruit
with
slight
vinous
andor
acetic
elements
taste
is
sour
applescherries
and
too
much
alochol
for
the
low
abv
body
is
medium
full
mainly
from
the
younger
of
the
blend
depending
on
the
age
of
the
blend
the
sourness
will
vary
this
sample
was
much
more
sour
than
others
that
i
have
had
that
have
been
almost
cloyingly
sweet
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
attempts
a
balance
between
the
younger
more
sweet
beer
in
the
blend
and
the
assertively
sour
older
beer
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
not
a
fan
of
the
style
oi
was
apprehensive
at
first
but
its
actually
very
good
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
afternoons
i
spent
as
a
kid
in
my
relatives
houses
out
in
the
country
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
definitely
see
myself
getting
this
again
when
i
have
the
money
to
drop
one
a
20
four
pack
which
probably
wont
be
soon
this
is
something
i
will
seek
out
again
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
luxury
to
sample
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
you
should
definitely
take
advantage
o
good
flavors
but
it
is
over
the
top
sour
for
me
a
good
sipper
but
certainly
not
something
i
seeking
out
to
have
again
d
one
of
the
more
sessionable
sours
available
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
without
a
meal
to
go
with
it
this
is
not
a
good
beer
to
be
had
alone
imo
i
would
recommend
with
chinese
or
japanese
maybe
even
some
indian
dishes
would
also
pair
with
saucy
bbq
d
the
sweetness
kinda
kills
the
drinkability
i
wish
the
sour
was
a
lot
more
powerful
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
the
cpj
many
say
this
a
love
or
hate
beer
i
do
neither
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
this
is
such
a
great
one
i
must
say
i
think
i
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
a
bit
better
but
the
duchesse
is
simply
sublime
just
a
hair
on
the
sweet
side
but
thats
just
being
nitpicky
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
this
is
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
if
you
are
even
remotely
interested
in
sours
you
must
get
this
one
drinkability
super
easy
the
lack
of
the
heavy
tart
flavor
makes
this
unusually
easy
poured
into
a
chalicesnifter
it
was
a
dark
brown
with
flecks
of
red
it
had
a
tan
twofinger
head
that
left
nice
rings
of
lace
it
smelled
of
sour
cherries
and
malt
it
tasted
very
sour
with
a
little
sweet
kick
there
was
a
good
dosage
of
malt
too
it
was
crisp
and
sharp
it
was
mediumbodied
beer
drinkability
this
is
almost
winelike
and
lambicesque
in
its
tasting
which
im
a
fan
of
with
this
in
mind
this
is
so
drinkable
that
its
almost
off
the
scale
ive
had
this
bottle
for
close
to
three
years
and
im
impressed
by
the
flavor
that
is
still
evident
from
this
bottle
must
compare
it
to
a
newer
version
to
find
what
the
differences
are
if
any
would
try
again
in
any
form
a
must
notes
i
enjoy
sours
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
type
its
always
good
easy
to
drink
and
just
an
overall
quality
choice
all
in
all
i
was
mighty
impressed
by
this
beer
the
smell
turned
me
off
a
bit
at
first
but
it
was
a
small
problem
with
an
otherwise
delicious
beer
d
couldnt
get
past
the
winish
notes
not
for
me
not
saying
its
bad
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
light
body
not
overly
carbonated
quite
drinkable
but
a
sipper
nonetheless
drink
not
as
bad
as
what
i
thought
but
for
the
top20
rating
in
its
style
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
suprice
was
nice
to
sip
on
while
relaxing
had
a
nice
profile
of
sweettart
flavors
to
it
overall
a
really
nice
warm
weather
easy
drinking
sour
ale
this
is
the
perfect
introduction
to
sours
i
would
like
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
just
before
the
best
before
date
to
see
if
there
is
a
difference
not
a
favourite
but
there
is
character
enough
to
keep
one
exploring
albeit
with
more
than
a
little
trepidation
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
was
a
unique
style
of
beer
having
been
my
first
flanders
red
but
with
that
said
i
would
drink
another
right
now
if
i
had
one
o
the
bomber
size
is
as
about
as
much
as
i
would
want
i
enjoyed
the
sour
experience
but
i
hope
to
find
something
more
to
my
liking
next
time
i
venture
for
something
deemed
sour
even
still
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
i
would
have
this
more
often
if
it
wasnt
so
pricey
i
felt
like
every
taste
brought
a
new
flavor
to
the
table
it
was
incredibly
dynamic
and
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
second
bottle
to
age
in
my
celar
for
future
enjoyment
dwow
i
was
expecting
quite
a
bit
more
sourness
but
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
lindemans
faro
with
a
bit
of
sour
fantastic
mouth
feel
high
carbonation
tastes
of
sweet
sour
cherry
and
beer
minor
funk
cuts
through
to
make
it
interesting
drink
it
too
quick
and
all
you
get
in
vinegar
so
dont
ill
be
drinking
this
again
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
sour
this
is
a
very
nice
flanders
red
ale
i
recommend
this
beer
highly
duchesse
de
bourgogne
has
a
reddish
brown
colour
and
a
decent
5
mm
head
that
fades
to
lacing
quite
quickly
the
smell
is
sour
and
vinegary
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
some
sour
apple
and
some
flavour
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
maybe
umami
the
aftertaste
is
smooth
and
good
with
smallest
hint
of
bitterness
the
texture
is
foamy
pretty
thick
overall
a
very
nice
sour
ale
very
drinkable
clean
and
refreshing
unusual
and
interesting
flavours
and
wellbalanced
sour
and
sweet
very
complex
wont
tire
of
contemplating
the
many
nuances
an
excellent
beer
i
hope
to
be
drinking
regularly
o
im
into
this
i
want
to
travel
to
flanders
now
and
get
into
all
the
sour
shit
they
have
the
beer
was
more
sweet
to
me
than
sour
but
not
overly
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
sour
ale
in
my
opinion
notes
the
wonderful
balance
of
flavor
and
body
works
to
give
it
lots
of
complex
character
and
drinkability
i
would
highly
recommend
to
both
wine
and
beer
drinkers
who
like
sours
the
acidity
stays
with
the
beer
as
i
drink
but
it
mellows
and
there
is
a
little
sweetness
before
the
sour
takes
over
my
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
not
great
however
as
i
drink
i
find
this
beer
growing
on
me
it
is
very
good
for
its
style
but
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
dextremely
drinkable
i
think
it
would
be
perfect
to
have
on
a
nice
summer
day
sitting
out
on
the
deck
or
proch
to
end
the
day
d
the
25cl
bottles
are
far
too
small
for
this
beer
very
drinkable
deep
red
brownish
color
extremely
pungent
smell
almost
like
vinegar
the
smell
almost
overpowers
everything
else
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
this
stuff
goes
down
much
too
easily
very
complex
and
drinkable
almost
too
drinkable
dangerous
very
very
nice
we
paired
it
with
a
brie
with
currant
jelly
very
nice
mixture
all
and
all
a
bit
disappointing
i
expected
a
sour
treat
and
i
got
a
sugar
bomb
oh
well
d
an
11
2
oz
is
the
perfect
serving
size
for
this
style
beer
more
than
one
might
be
overkill
but
ill
definitely
buying
a
few
more
to
stash
and
drink
at
a
later
time
overall
extremely
complex
i
love
the
flanders
red
style
as
long
as
they
are
wellconstructed
this
hits
the
mark
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
it
is
something
that
i
would
not
like
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
it
feels
perfect
for
splitting
a
750
ml
with
someone
when
have
a
nice
meal
d
brilliant
i
could
drink
this
for
hours
until
i
succumb
to
a
happiness
comatose
state
d
this
is
terrific
drinking
and
is
not
overly
sweet
or
sour
like
others
in
its
style
drinkability
amazingly
drinkable
especially
for
a
style
that
people
seem
to
think
is
less
accessible
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
could
easily
foresee
drinking
a
whole
bottle
by
myself
great
price
too
10bottle
for
something
that
is
definitely
as
good
as
much
more
expensive
ones
taste
is
very
complex
a
bit
almost
too
sweet
trappist
yeast
interesting
but
not
the
belgin
i
was
expecting
as
always
my
2
only
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
seems
kinda
creamy
and
fluffy
great
tart
scents
flowing
off
of
this
beer
nice
vinegar
along
with
cherries
and
raspberries
very
nice
fruity
scent
tied
in
with
the
vinegar
taste
is
not
quite
as
tart
as
it
smells
but
does
not
lower
the
quality
of
this
beer
at
all
the
sweetness
is
so
complimentary
to
the
light
tartness
and
this
just
blends
to
amount
to
a
very
tasty
flemish
red
the
cherry
sweetness
really
comes
through
this
beer
along
with
some
delicious
oak
and
wood
flavors
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
be
so
creamy
and
fullbodied
drinkability
is
quite
high
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
nice
starter
beer
for
those
trying
to
get
into
the
flemish
style
and
move
on
to
more
sour
ales
very
tasty
pours
excellent
reddish
brown
with
golden
head
2finger
head
leaving
some
laces
aroma
partially
disappointed
me
notes
of
stale
cabbage
are
a
bit
unpleasant
also
fresher
dark
fruits
fortunately
taste
is
quite
well
similar
to
kriek
but
of
course
more
complex
and
slightly
astringent
tart
cherries
dark
fruits
winelike
alcohol
profile
excellent
carbonation
tingles
a
tongue
beer
for
flanders
ales
fans
d
have
had
it
both
on
tap
and
in
bottle
the
tap
is
far
superior
to
the
bottles
you
will
get
at
the
local
bottle
shop
might
have
to
travel
abroad
to
get
it
on
tap
but
worth
the
trip
espcially
if
you
are
in
europe
enjoying
the
vacation
as
well
p
s
if
you
can
find
a
fresher
bottle
just
do
it
the
acetic
qualities
of
this
beer
come
real
fast
as
this
beer
ages
i
love
my
first
sour
beer
and
flanders
red
ale
will
power
has
kept
me
from
having
finished
the
glass
already
while
this
sours
might
not
be
a
go
to
they
are
a
new
favorite
duchesse
is
nothing
extreme
but
very
tasty
d
easily
drinkable
from
start
to
finish
i
thought
i
would
devour
it
when
i
took
my
first
sip
it
contained
me
well
though
the
flavor
is
so
full
bodied
and
complex
it
both
invites
you
to
drink
more
and
wards
you
off
with
a
lasting
and
lingering
pucker
looking
forward
to
another
one
day
soon
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
effervescent
still
pretty
darn
carbonated
id
never
session
such
a
brew
but
its
still
tasty
and
good
highly
drinkable
despite
the
price
of
this
beer
but
its
totally
worth
it
very
tasty
and
easy
to
kick
back
2nd
drinkability
glad
i
got
to
enjoy
this
beer
again
totally
different
aspects
in
tasting
the
2nd
time
as
first
had
a
glass
of
water
in
between
beers
the
2nd
time
and
this
was
the
obvious
difference
would
drink
a
3rd
time
too
d
the
sour
pucker
followed
by
the
refreshing
finish
practically
begs
for
another
sip
that
being
said
i
prefer
to
just
take
my
time
with
beers
like
this
one
my
first
true
sour
experience
im
hooked
already
d
very
drinkable
looking
at
the
bottle
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
would
want
to
finish
it
all
at
once
but
i
cant
help
myself
deep
ruby
color
offwhite
head
with
ample
carbonation
good
head
retention
strong
vinegar
aroma
twangy
with
bready
notes
too
raisiny
malt
sour
flavor
heavy
earthy
malts
sweet
and
fruity
too
less
vinegar
in
flavor
but
still
quite
acidic
medium
body
and
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
and
with
tons
of
flavor
d
the
flavours
are
so
interesting
wasnt
sure
i
like
it
at
first
taste
but
a
couple
sips
later
and
i
couldnt
stop
myself
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
a
bit
i
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
any
flanders
red
or
brown
ales
that
i
have
tried
todate
but
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
is
sweet
tart
has
a
complex
fruitiness
despite
having
no
fruit
in
it
and
a
wonderful
finish
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
for
all
the
sourness
on
the
nose
this
beer
ended
up
having
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
with
a
slightly
artificial
note
sour
and
malty
that
kept
me
sipping
faster
than
id
intended
i
suppose
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
sour
in
the
overall
flavor
balance
but
this
beer
was
still
very
enjoyable
i
thought
this
beer
had
a
great
reputation
and
it
did
not
disapoint
jake
d
good
but
not
sure
i
could
have
more
than
two
at
a
sitting
since
it
is
very
sweet
d
infinitely
drinkable
a
beer
that
novices
seasoned
bas
alike
should
love
notes
well
worth
the
21
99
for
the
four
pack
i
bought
would
actually
consider
buying
this
again
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
non
beer
drinkers
that
like
fruity
drinks
my
sister
doesnt
like
beer
at
all
she
loved
this
enough
to
ask
me
for
one
of
my
bottles
i
would
definitely
order
this
beer
again
if
i
ever
see
it
would
also
be
a
good
introductory
beer
if
youre
not
used
to
this
style
this
beer
has
a
really
great
mouthfeel
it
is
complex
and
has
a
very
delicious
and
lingering
finish
d
very
smooth
and
delicious
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
sour
type
beers
ive
had
to
date
im
thinking
this
would
pair
nicely
with
a
large
ceasar
salad
but
smooth
enough
that
it
makes
a
nice
session
beer
enjoyed
drinking
the
entire
bomber
while
watching
football
notes
so
far
not
my
favorite
sour
ale
but
definitely
a
category
im
falling
in
love
with
did
i
mention
that
this
beer
is
like
sparkling
cider
deep
amber
brown
with
a
pillowy
sand
colored
head
that
burns
off
fairly
quick
cider
vinegar
cherry
and
oak
with
a
faint
ketchup
kind
of
vegetal
aroma
tart
cherry
toasted
oak
and
vanilla
with
a
citric
sourness
the
flavors
meld
perfectly
and
are
well
balanced
medium
light
bodied
and
effervescent
delicious
ipoured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
murky
purple
in
color
with
a
nice
sticky
white
head
lots
of
lacing
tart
almost
vinegar
aroma
sweet
and
tart
flavors
oak
and
and
a
very
drying
finish
light
in
body
and
full
or
carbonation
almost
wine
like
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
as
an
occasional
treat
pours
a
clean
orangeish
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sour
cherry
and
oaky
hints
in
the
taste
sweet
to
sour
dark
cherry
and
a
small
oaky
hint
a
smooth
and
sour
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
oaky
and
cherry
aftertaste
nice
oaky
hints
with
a
nice
cherry
sourness
great
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
exceptional
drinkability
outstanding
im
extremely
bummed
i
dont
have
another
bottle
of
the
duchesse
to
sip
and
savor
pours
a
nice
off
red
color
with
a
bit
of
brown
very
light
off
white
head
nose
brings
cherries
and
a
bit
of
balsamic
slight
caramel
flavor
the
taste
brings
oak
cherries
acetic
acid
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
feel
is
moderate
and
quite
creamy
a
bit
of
an
acetic
character
drinks
really
really
well
and
is
still
one
of
the
best
introductory
sour
beers
poured
into
a
wine
glass
with
a
lovely
thick
foamy
head
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
red
hue
to
it
smells
like
fig
and
roasted
goodness
tastes
very
sweet
with
a
strong
note
of
candied
cherries
feels
like
a
geuze
and
a
faro
combined
almost
very
sticky
on
the
tongue
goes
down
smooth
and
is
pretty
drinkable
but
almost
a
little
too
rich
this
is
my
second
time
drinking
this
first
on
tap
and
i
much
say
that
i
do
prefer
it
from
the
bottle
but
it
really
is
not
great
but
quite
good
a
rich
sweet
beer
that
came
across
as
not
too
cloying
because
of
the
tart
dryness
that
went
along
with
it
so
much
going
on
in
here
though
that
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
a
whole
one
my
overall
impression
is
that
duchesse
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
her
true
essence
lies
beneath
the
cloying
facade
id
definitely
get
this
again
overall
impression
unique
and
complex
this
delicious
red
ale
is
reminiscent
of
a
carbonated
plum
wine
mmmm
give
me
more
its
an
ok
beer
to
be
sure
but
there
are
others
in
this
style
that
i
will
go
to
highly
recommended
for
this
style
actually
its
verhaeghe
vichte
sorry
folks
pours
a
beautiful
dark
cherry
red
with
a
halffingers
worth
of
creamy
off
white
head
decent
carbonation
aroma
is
wonderful
some
funk
some
spice
lots
of
black
cherry
and
raspberry
notes
very
nice
so
far
one
of
the
best
ive
seen
to
this
point
wow
very
sweet
to
some
it
might
be
cloying
brilliant
flavors
mostly
fruit
like
cherry
and
raspberry
very
fruit
forward
to
the
point
its
almost
winelike
this
is
lucious
the
carbonation
really
rounds
out
the
sweetness
its
really
like
a
black
cherry
soda
with
less
sugar
and
with
added
alcohol
some
may
hate
this
as
its
less
a
beer
and
more
a
lambic
fruit
ale
emphasis
on
the
fruit
i
love
it
and
think
its
awesome
anytime
of
year
must
find
folks
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
but
fairly
light
the
light
carbonation
goes
well
with
the
sweet
sour
finish
very
drinkable
this
is
one
great
beer
flavorful
complex
but
doesnt
overwhelm
or
knock
you
out
that
said
two
is
probably
my
limit
maybe
i
had
expectation
bias
but
i
went
in
prepared
to
love
this
i
loved
it
so
there
you
go
drink
i
have
to
say
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
can
see
how
it
might
appeal
to
some
but
this
beer
isnt
for
me
um
really
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
outside
of
the
smell
being
a
bit
offputting
this
is
a
real
great
beer
drinkability
overall
this
ones
pretty
drinkable
thanks
to
the
silky
mouthfeel
and
fascinating
flavor
combinations
its
not
a
session
beer
but
it
has
a
lot
of
character
complexity
and
new
things
to
discover
with
each
sip
this
style
may
not
be
for
me
i
find
the
aroma
to
be
a
bit
too
much
but
the
flavor
is
well
accomplished
different
and
complex
taste
is
fermented
plums
and
raspberries
with
hint
of
fig
oakywoody
dr
pepperlike
character
light
fruityyeasty
hint
mostly
sweet
with
light
sourness
and
aftertaste
of
grains
dr
pepper
and
fruit
md
nice
light
mouthfeel
not
too
syrupy
or
anything
but
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
after
awhile
for
me
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
those
looking
to
explore
beers
with
more
sour
qualities
without
being
overwhelmed
dont
think
ill
be
buying
much
more
of
this
however
a
decent
offering
but
when
im
looking
for
a
flanders
red
ale
id
rather
spend
my
money
on
some
others
over
this
one
rodenbachs
and
la
folie
come
to
mind
d
i
could
sip
this
all
night
a
great
flanders
red
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
overall
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
taste
would
like
it
to
be
a
lot
more
sour
and
it
is
a
tad
overcarbonated
would
like
it
better
i
think
if
more
sugars
were
devoured
and
made
into
a
9
flemish
i
bet
it
would
taste
a
lot
better
drinkability
i
wished
i
bought
another
at
6
abv
its
sessionable
especially
for
a
flanders
red
im
not
sure
what
the
shelf
life
is
with
this
beer
but
the
best
by
date
on
this
bottle
is
10210
and
today
is
91010
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
or
what
but
maybe
ill
seek
out
a
little
fresher
bottle
d
this
was
a
good
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
try
a
perfect
amount
came
in
the
bottle
and
left
me
really
not
wanting
anymore
i
would
do
yourself
a
favor
and
seek
this
beer
out
drinkability
a
very
desirable
sour
that
is
a
pleasure
to
partake

highlights

revealing

of

is
very
rich
and
complex
tart
fruit
a
little
vinegary
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
a
vinous
quality
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
cabernet
there
also
seem
to
be
traces
of
spice
cinnamon
and
and
cork
intermingled
with
the
other
aromas
taste
consistent
with
nose
distinctive
aromas
coalesce
nicely
into
a
complex
brew
maybe
with
some
traces
of
wood
expressed
in
the
flavor
profile
as
well
as
muted
atomic
fireballs
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
with
an
even
carbonation
level
that
falls
shy
of
lively
and
a
finish
that
falls
just
short
of
semidry
having
never
had
this
before
i
cant
tell
if
its
really
past
its
prime
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
found
it
interesting
and
complex
a
nice
introduction
to
sours
for
those
new
to
the
style
in
my
opinion
taste
is
a
bit
watery
slightly
sour
a
little
sweetness
in
the
back
dark
fruits
and
cherries
malt
and
salmon
berry
ends
a
little
tart
on

short
review
as
i
am
at
the
bar
and
in
a
rush
sour
fruit
aromas
acidic
taste
notes
of
nail
polish
remover
and
acetone
the
acetone
mixed
with
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
really
is
a
turn
off
to
me
reddish
color
with
a
tan
head
not
terribly
good
but
ok
for
the
style
lightmedium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
starts
off
powerful
and
finishes
pretty
mild
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
a
session
brew
due
to
the
vinegar
and
sourness
but
you
can
if
thats
your
bag
for
me
this
is
a
good
sipper
beer
i
feel
like
im
really
being
generous
with
this
review
all
in
all
a
very
good
flanders
red
overall
a
very
strong
strong
flemish
red
in
the
same
realm
as
kastel
rouge
or
belgian
red
but
more
sour
and
closer
to
the
style
of
the
flemish
red
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
definitely
would
pare
well
with
a
variety
of
desserts
none
of
the
vinegar
acidity
ive
had
in
other
sour
beers
just
a
really
great
light
fruity
tartness
light
and
full
of
flavor
im
a
big
fan
cheers
overall
i
dig
this
beer
its
everything
a
flanders
red
should
be
a
touch
too
sweet
for
revisiting
a
few
times
in
a
sitting
but
a
nice
sour
and
something
that
has
served
as
a
bridge
into
the
genre
for
many
again
memories
of
fermented
apples
in
a
complex
fruity
range
similar
to
some
raw
ciders
from
northern
spain
overall
very
tasty
flanders
extremely
easy
to
drink
d
couldnt
be
better
i
can
put
away
a
750ml
bottle
of
this
like
nobodys
business
probably
do
at
least
once
a
month
its
not
too
sour
so
id
absolutely
recommend
it
to
someone
whos
getting
started
on
this
style
while
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
everyday
the
duchesse
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
and
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
probably
drink
this
on
special
occasions
or
just
because
its
tuesday
i
would
recommend
it
while
having
some
form
of
bleu
cheese
no
real
tartness
oak
character
or
yeast
notes
to
speak
of
for
me
just
overly
sweet
thick
fruit
flavors
seems
like
it
would
god
very
well
with
a
rich
steak
salty
meats
subtle
balsamic
salads
or
nuts
i
would
imagine
some
age
would
dry
this
beer
out
and
make
it
a
truly
delicious
experiences
that
isnt
quite
so
sweet
an
interesting
taste
light
drinkable
good
poured
reddish
brown
with
a
reddis
hint
of
tan
head
smell
kind
of
reminds
me
of
soy
sauce
taste
is
complicated
with
various
fruits
and
vinegar
noticable
sort
of
slick
to
the
tongue
pretty
drinkable
for
such
an
odd
flavor
and
smell
my
wife
has
told
me
that
if
we
ever
renew
our
vows
the
duchess
is
going
to
make
an
appearance
at
the
toast
it
really
is
that
good
and
classy
try
this
now
beer
will
never
seem
the
same
to
you
again
o
this
would
be
a
good
apertif
beer
i
simply
prefer
a
little
less
fruit
that
is
not
to
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
it
is
quite
good
and
full
of
fruit
flavors
for
those
so
inclined
you
will
like
this
beer
too
sweet
for
diehard
hop
fans
but
good
for
the
belgian
beginner
d
real
easy
to
drink
but
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
an
evening
d
just
a
very
nice
beer
both
aggressive
and
mellow
a
strange
combination
and
one
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
of
very
nice
mf
is
decent
a
bit
prickly
medium
bodied
dry
finish
not
as
dry
as
i
would
have
preferred
however
sweetness
on
the
back
end
of
this
one
gets
in
the
way
of
the
drinkability
though
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
flanders
drinkability
absolutely
a
new
staple
beer
in
my
fridge
great
flavor
thats
complex
and
diverse
enough
to
keep
you
interested
and
tasty
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
the
body
of
this
beer
is
perfect
and
the
abv
is
perfect
for
sessioning
absolutely
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
is
great
what
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
think
i
prefer
rodenbach
though
the
nose
on
this
one
is
just
a
tiny
bit
off
putting
to
me
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
is
still
a
top
notch
beer
a
tasty
tasty
beer
lots
of
good
here
and
while
not
easy
to
drink
its
the
sort
of
sour
id
be
back
for
in
an
instant
taste
is
initially
very
sour
and
slightly
funky
but
the
sourness
settles
down
very
quickly
into
ripened
fruits
cherry
plum
jam
pear
the
finish
is
long
and
lingering
the
sourness
almost
completely
subsides
into
the
background
and
becomes
just
a
tartness
in
the
mouthfeel
after
13
of
glass
after
that
point
it
just
tastes
like
a
very
interesting
dessert
wine
and
very
easy
going
down
yet
tastes
far
from
simple
duchesse
is
a
wonderfully
smooth
flanders
that
can
be
drunken
like
session
beer
and
hold
my
interest
at
the
same
time
i
feel
lucky
to
be
close
to
pubs
that
serve
it
on
the
tap
regularly
d
for
a
sour
brew
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
such
a
fine
and
unique
brew
d
excellent
beer
just
amazing
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
soon
if
i
can
i
was
surprised
and
impressed
overall
i
enjoyed
this
particular
serving
more
than
the
other
bottle
i
had
about
a
year
ago
which
tasted
more
like
vinegar
and
old
stale
wine
to
me
this
serving
may
have
been
fresher
as
it
was
cleaner
and
presented
with
more
fruit
sweetness
drinkability
remarkably
complex
very
rich
and
flavorful
the
excessive
carbonation
and
the
initial
vinegar
in
the
nose
are
this
beers
biggest
flaws
but
the
rest
of
the
ale
is
very
well
crafted
amazing
flavor
and
great
value
d
wonderful
this
is
a
wonderful
sour
that
i
could
definitely
see
myself
picking
up
again
especially
since
its
now
available
at
the
grocery
store
i
regularly
shop
at
impressions
ill
preface
by
saying
that
ive
never
had
a
flemish
red
before
but
i
really
tried
to
keep
an
open
mind
there
may
be
a
possibility
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
just
was
not
good
i
had
a
really
hard
time
even
finishing
it
it
was
like
drinking
balsamic
vinaigrette
ive
heard
this

being

was

not
one
that
will
be
a

session
beer
but
highly
drinkable
for
a
sour
in
my
view
986
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
so
that
detracts
from
the
drinkability
but
the
distinct
flavor
and
intriguing
aroma
are
qualities
that
are
hard
to
ignore
not
an
everyday
beer
but
definitely
one
to
try
from
time
to
time
d
definitely
a
good
beer
robust
flavor
with
a
substantial
depth
to
it
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
more
often
chewy

with
almost
divine
carbonation
tickling
the

it
is
a
well
attenuated
beer
with
great
balance
making
it
very
drinkable
however
i
could
only
drink
one
very
interesting
i
have
had
nothing
like
this
beer
before
some
might
be
turned
off
by
the
sourness
but
i
love
it
unbelievable
complexity
i
had
no
idea
what
the
abv
was
but
i
was
sure
of
two
things
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
if
i
did
i
wouldnt
make
it
to
work
the
next
day
tart
tannic
the
burgundy
duchess
took
me
on
a
rollercoaster
of
taste
starring
sweet
and
sour
red
fruit
i
dont
know
what
else
exactly
but
there
was
an
earthiness
and
a
floral
element
to
boot
again
i
was
blown
away
a
dry
finish
to
what
could
have
been
a
puckerinducing
glass
as
well
as
an
alcohol
content
masked
by
the
sourness
only
add
to
its
high
marks
not
something
i
would
drink
every
night
or
would
i
but
an
amazing
treat
for
when
ive
been

a

surprisingly
light
colored
head
at
first
whiff
it
reminded
me
of
very
expensive
balsamic
vinegar
and
strong
cider
without
the
spice
my
first
taste
was
taken
slow
and
a
small
amount
because
i
figured
this
sour
brown
was
gonna
do
a
number
on
my
palate
much
to
my
surprise
the
sourness
did
not
trash
my
mouth
as
new
belgiums
la

the
first
time
a
little
more
acid
then
most
but
flavors
of
apple
cider
balsamic

sweet
dried
fruits
with
tart
finish
on

better
to
be

out
of
the
4
pack
if

alone
or
shared
with
a
friend
if
enjoying
a
750
ml
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
at
pizzeria
paradiso
in
georgetown
washington
dc
this
brew
left
very
sticky
lasting
lacing
despite
having
only
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
comprising
its
head
the
bubbles
were
light
tan
and
the
body
was
a
translucent
rubybrown
the
nose
was
led
by
grapes
then
cherries
a
touch
of
vinegar
and
pepper
very
nice
the
taste
wsa
quite
similar
and
pretty
dry
and
quality
overall
but
with
a
bit
too
much
acidity
the
body
was
mediumlight
with
also
a
light
but
tingly
carbonation
a
bit

but
still
enjoyable
mediumbottled
fairly
highly
carbonated
smooth
a
very
good
beer
very
complex
and
yet
well
balanced
delicious
sour
red
from
the
flanders
region
of
belgium
the
sweet
and
sour
creates
a
delicious
feel
on
the
tounge
and
goes
down
smoothly
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
if
at
all
with
the
sour
shining
through
a
classic
example
of
the
flanders
style
and
worth
looking
out
for
my
first
experience
in
the
flemish
art
of
brewing
new
and
exciting
brew
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
a
slighlty
effervescent
head
aromas
were
strong
on
malts
sweet
molasses
somewhat
yeasty
finish
with
an
almost
vinelike
quality
taste
was
big
my
mouth
puckered
as
the
big
sweetness
was
replaced
by
dry
sourness
a
combination
of
dried
raisens
cherries
and
aged
balsamic
tingling
carbonation
allowed
the
earthy
woodiness
to
come
through
and
beat
down
the
sourness
somewhat
heavy
bodied
in
my
opinion
it
had
the
qualities
of
a
good
port
with
a
sour
kick
i
had
to
sip
this
one
as
my
palate
was
overwhelmed
a
musttry
but
i
expect
it
would
take
a
more
refined
palate
to
make
this
one
a
go
to
brew
drinkability
fairly
easy
drinking
although
a
little
to
sweet
for
much
more
than
one
glass
more
carbonaiton
would
help
here
appeared
dark
amber
with
a
strong
smooth
frothy
onefinger
head
that
shrank
but
never
totally
dissipated
during
the
duration
of
the
taste
smelled
strongly
of
apples
sour
cherry
some
sweet
dark
fruit
and
a
little
yeast
the
taste
centered
on
apples
pears
and
a
little
sour
cherry
very
strong
on
the
sour
apple
flavor
a
champagnelike
effervescence
filled
the
mouth
until
the
very
end
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
very
good
drinkability
a
nice
red
sourstyle
and
i
would
definitely
drink
a
few
if
i
had
more
oddly
enough
i
found
the
sometimes
rotten
service
at
frth
to
be
exceptionally
cordial
and
efficient
i
was
sitting
at
the
bar
and
was
just
finishing
a
hercules
dipa
on
cask
and
asked
the
guy
to
recommend
something
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
from
the
hercules
and
he
gave
me
a
3ounce
sample
of
this
which
motivated
purchasing
a
12
ounce
glass
what
a
great
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
lots
of
reddish
hints
to
it
making
it
almost
seem
a
dull
burnt
orange
in
bright
light
a
huge
billowing
white
head
faded
quickly
but
left
a
nice
film
of
lace
about
the
top
for
most
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
probably
the
strongest
i
have
ever
smelled
in
a
beer
almost
knocked
me
over
huge
flavors
of
sour
grapes
and
apples
lots
of
fruity
hints
in
there
and
very
very
strong
really
like
nothing
i
have
ever
smelled
the
taste
was
unbelievably
sour
like
sour
candy
sour
huge
flavors
too
much
for
me
actually
made
my
eyes
water
with
every
sip
very
light
mouth
feel
and
great
carbonation
were
nice
and
helped
it
go
down
smoothly
but
was
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
flavors
were
big
grapes
apples
peaches
raisins
plums
very
very
complex
and
fruity
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
it
but
i
am
not
sure
if
this
was
due
t
o
the
style
or
this
particular
brew
i
will
have
to
try
a
couple
more
to
get
a
better
feel
but
this
one
was
rough
on
me
i
could
see
how
someone
would
like
its
deep
complex
character
just
not
me
d
definitely
a
good
beer
mild
pleasant
flavor
with
a
substantial
depth
to
it
worth
a
try
certainly
a
good
beer
to
convert
those
who
dislike
hops
overall
this
is
a
different
but
very
enjoyable
brew
the
tartness
may
be
a
turn
off
to
some
and
may
play
into
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
some
might
get
the
taste
buds
burnt
out
but
i
think
it
is
worth
the
try
and
well
worth
another
bottle
why
ever
drink
any
thing
again
after
this
beer
i
love
this
beer
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
i
drink
it
in
my
maudite
tulip
glass
the
color
of
duchesse
is
a
wonderfully
dark
red
and
it
looks
awesome
behind
the
maudites
winged
devil
the
head
is
around
23
fingers
and
a
light
tan
color
not
real
sticky
but
some
nice
lace
smell
is
a
sour
smell
but
so
much
more
hard
to
explain
i
fine
this
beer
very
complex
taste
is
sour
and
very
drinkable
no
alc
taste
being
only

this
was
expected
all
in
all
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
to
try
try
a
sour
flemish
tonight
and
this
is
an
awesome
example
of
them
this
brew
has
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
the
last
6
months
as
i
feared
of
a
potential
similarity
to
rodenbach
grand
cru
different
world
outofthis
world
first
and
foremost
is
the
absence
of
clinical
levels
of
acids
which
are
present
in
rodenbach
this
brew
is
extraordinarily
well
balanced
slightly
sour
slightly
acidic
and
moderately
sweet
the
nose
is
a
soft
essence
of
wet
wood
with
the
perfect
accompaniment
of
bret
on
the
nose
wonderfully
integrated
an
impressive
foamy
tan
head
leading
to
massive
lacing
throughout
the
tasting
sweet
malts
and
candy
sugars
make
for
the
perfect
foil
to
the
sour
elements
of
this
brew
this
bottle
was
easily
consumed
with
a
meal
of
sweet
sour
shrimp
stirfry
simply
a
perfect
match
with
its
rich
deep
cinnamon
color
beautiful
balance
and
exceptional
flavor
profile
this
is
a
surprisingly
complex
and
delectable
treat
drinakbility
well
i
definitely
plan
on
having
another
of
these
and
saving
the
last
2
for
company
at
some
point
i
could
see
this
going
very
well
with
a
dessert
i
have
never
tasted
anything
like
this
much
more
fruity
and
matured
than
the
fruit
lambics
still
it
is
very
sour
and
chemical
330
ml
brown

best

the
duchesse
is
a
blend
of
8
and
18
month
old
ales
that
have
been
aged
in
oak
casks
it
pours
a
lightlysedimented
mahogany
that
thins
to
amber
near
the
bottom
of
the
flute
and
has
medium
to
light
carbonation
that
goes
up
to
an
inch
of
yellowishbrown
head
that
leaves
nice
sheets
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
sour
lactic
with
fruit
berries
chocolate
mild
oak
iron
and
maybe
some
green
hops
all
blended
very
nicely
it
is
a
delicious
beer
both
sweet
and
tart
with
a
lactic
or
wild
sourness
a
mild
bitterness
raspberryblackberry
cherry
chocolate
and
maybe
some
greenleafy
hops
but
is
overall
just
a
touch
too
sweet
the
body
is
light
to
medium
body
smooth
with
a
tannic
dryness
and
medium
carbonation
and
finish
overall
very
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
not
too
sour
and
fairly
balanced
i
could
probably
drink
two
or
three
in
a
row
without
too
much
trouble
drinks
allright
would
pair
well
with
many
meats
fish
even
salads
just
not
a
session
ale
but
one
to
ponder
savor
by
a
fire
or
in
a
dimly
belgian
pub
i
prefer
rodnebachs

to
this
this
is
a
beer
universe
expander
well
worth
a
try
fairly
thin

even
carbonation
keeps
things

you
can

drinkability
i
find
this
to
be
an
interesting
beer
and
not
bad
at
all
just
not
something
i
ever
want
to
drink
again
its
far
too
strange
for
me
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
suprise
not
a
style
of
beer
that
im
fond
of
but
i
am
very
fond
of
this
particular
beer
and
will
be
looking
for
some
more
youve
heard
the
term
smooth
as

and
that
is
an
accurate
description
of
the
mouthfeel
here
no
carbonation
detectable
at
all
but
somehow
a
thin
film
of
lace
clung
to
the
glass
with
each

not

tons
of

sour

not

acidic
at

taste
has
a
weird
contrast
of
sweet

tart
the
sweetness
is
fruity
and
kind
of
sugary
but
is
soon
balanced
out
by
a
drying

finish
lingers
a

not
really
the

take
those
characteristics

dont
know
where
to
begin
with
this
beer
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
the
color
is
a
gorgeous
deep
ruby
if
the
head
would
have
held
a

interlude
to
delicate
oakiness
my
only
minor
complaint
is
that
its
faint
smell
totally
belies
the
explosive
flavor
of
this
beauty
truly
a
sexy
beer
by
all
counts
this
appeared
a
deep
brown
caramel
color
with
a
fairly
tall
light
tan
head
scatterings
of
lace
were
left
as
this
was
consumed
and
the
head
retention
was
minimal
holy
crap
when
i
first
poured
this
i
took
a
big
whiff
and
was
hit
with
a
huge
funky
tart
aroma
that
was
a
bit
overpowering
after
letting
it
air
for
a
bit
it
became
much
more
pleasant
with
a
bit
of
fruity
tartness
a
slight
vinegar
smell
and
some
woody
notes
flavor
wise
this
was
super
tart
on
the
first
sip
that
made
me
think
it
was
going
to
take
a
while
to
get
through
this
glass
after
it
warmed
a
bit
i
found
it
much
more
tasty
and
palatable
with
a
nice
mix
of
tartness
and
sweetness
balancing
each
other
out
with
the
tartness
taking
a
slight
lead
there
were
fruit
flavors
and
woody
notes
in
the
taste
as
well
and
a
fairly
nice
lingering
sour
after
taste
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
with
a
soda
bubbly
feel
to
it
that
kind
of
detracted
from
it
a
bit
but
not
much
this
was
a
real
sipper
for
me
and
i
would
definitely
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
one
of
these
to
drink
it
i
would
have
it
again
in
the
future
but
i
doubt
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
very
interesting
stuff
that
deserves
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
and
i
suggest
letting
it
air
out
and
warm
a
bit
for
the
best
experience
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
malty
it
has
a
fruity
feel
as
well
which
enhances
the
pale
and
crystal
malts
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
here
as
well
the
taste
is
perfect
it
has
a
malty
base
but
is
dominated
with
a
tart
fruitiness
this
goes
down
very
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
acidic
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
drinking
beer
i
love
the
fruitiness
along
with
its
complex
malt
makeup
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
toronado
in
san
francisco
in
september
2004
served
in
a
authentic
duchesse
glass
watched
as
it
poured
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
remain
for
long
a
very
opaque
mahoganey
color
almost
like
blackcurrant
juice
a
beautiful
hue
to
it
tons
of
lace
that
just
stuck
to
the
side
and
didnt
disipate
smelled
both
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
a
typical
flemish
stlye
taste
but
better
not
too
sour
as
i
expected
maybe
a
cranberry
taste
or
even
something
nutty
in
the
background
aftertaste
is
good
as
well
a
definite
great
beer
that
i
will
have
again
mouthcoating
richness
balances
the
acidity
its
very
easy
drinking
i
was
worried
this
would
be
too
acidic
or
vinegary
to
drink
no
way
this
is
my
first
flanders
red
and
im
impressed
i
had
this
on
tap
twice
at
two
different
locations
and
it
is
consistently
good
it
pours
a
clear
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
is
one
that
is
predominantly
sour
malt
i
love
that
smell
but
have
brother
bas
that
hate
it
the
flavor
has
an
initial
hit
of
sweetness
but
is
quickly
drowned
by
the
sour
malt
taste
my
wife
calls
it
vinegar
but
i
love
it
it
has
a
mediumbodied
feel
on
the
palate
and
is
very
acidic
i
really
like
the
beer
but
one
is
my
limit
the
ascerbic
taste
is
too
much
for
prolonged
drinking
this
brew
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
amber
hues
and
a
thin
white
head
that
barely
leaves
any
bit
of
a
lace
aromas
are
a
mix
of
sweet
cherries
and
what
can
best
be
described
as
a
winey
vinegar
sort
of
scent
initially
flavors
are
sweet
and
tart
with
a
cherry
grape
like
flavor
that
almost
pushes
the
bounds
of
being
cough
syrup
like
following
there
is
a
slight
acidic
flavor
to
this
brew
and
just
a
hint
of
spice
which
makes
this
brew
totally
intriguing
the
brew
finishes
are
tart
and
acidic
as
it
started
with
fruit
dominating
in
the
end
overall
this
brew
was
funky
but
good
hits
your
tonue
with
a
quick
sweet
sour
flavor
very
candylike
citrusy
up
front
like
a
demented
lemonade
smoothly
transitions
and
leaves
your
mouth
with
a
fruity
syrupy
flavor
that
hangs
around
for
the
next
sip
dark
ambered
and
ruby
with
tons
of
carbination
rising
up
to
a
thick
and
creamy
khaki
head
wonderful
aroma
warm
and
oaky
molasses
almost
get
a
bbq
sauce
scent
very
spicey
like
a
worcester
sauce
make
sure
to
let
this
one
warm
up
so
you
get
all
the
flavors
and
scents
to
come
out
and
play
with
ya
tart
and
intense
flavors
wow
do
they
reallly
hit
you
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
sweet
and
sour
the
blithering
one
that
i
drank
this
with
said
he
tasted
pickled
beets
yep
damn
if
he
isnt
right
how
weird
but
yep
very
interesting
tastes
in
this
one
unusual
not
one
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
11
2ozers
because
there
is
such
a
huge
intensity
of
flavors
and
there
is
such
strength
but
like
i
said
quite
interesting
tastes
for
sure
new
to
bc
this
is
a
nice
find
pours
russet
brown
with
minimal
head
the
kicker
is
the
intense
sour
smell
on
the
nose
i
cant
say
i
like
the
smell
but
it
defines
this
beer
as
out
of
the
norm
the
flavours
are
a
mixture
of
sourness
old
cherries
and
vinous
notes
i
love
how
this
beer
tastes
like
it
has
been
down
in
the
cellar
forever
not
a
session
beer
by
any
standard
but
very
drinkable
in
small
quantiites
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
nice
creamysticky
head
that
leaves
waves
of
lace
down
my
brandy
snifteraromas
are
all
belgian
some
sour
cherry
and
malt
vinegar
with
a
touch
of
funk
hits
right
on
now
i
got
alot
more
sweetness
than
expected
in
this
brewa
kinda
sweetspicey
mix
that
coats
ur
mouth
with
only
a
touch
of
sourness
in
the
finish
wich
was
unexpected
i
picked
up
some
cherry
stone
and
iron
notes
a
little
more
as
i
drank
but
this
seems
to
stay
more
on
the
sweeter
side
for
the
styletrue
to
the
style
not
sure
but
worth
a
try
its
a
quality
brew
i
thought
at
first
that
i
mightve
gotten
a
bad
bottle
but
i
asked
around
and
the
people
that
i
talked
to
have
had
this
experience
some
liked
it
some
didnt
count
me
in
the
latter
group
it
tastes
like
a
bubbly
raspberry
vinegarette
ugh

good
stuff

to
my
top
ten
list
pours
into
a
goblet
with
a
bright
mahogany
color
not
unlike
a
merlot
topped
by
a
light
brown
head
with
very
tight
bubbles
the
head
is
very
frothy
with
a
few
aggressive
swirls
in
the
glass
smell
is
soured
fruit
and
a
light
vinegar
aroma
which
took
me
off
gaurd
being
new
to
the
style
taste
is
very
tart
and
fruity
cherries
yet
sweet
and
relatively
drinkable
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
unusually
creamy
mouthfeel
with
very
dense
carbonation
i
may
have
to
explore
more
of
these
diverse
and
fruity
belgian
ales
that
i
havent
been
interested
in
exploring
before
good
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
lacking
something
that
would
make
it
exceptional
really
a
great
experience
with
this
beer
the
nose
is
very
intense
vinegar
and
winey
notes
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
far
less
offensive
than
the
nose
big
round
malt
flavors
are
deftly
balanced
by
the
sourness
i
get
very
intense
raisin
flavors
in
the
finish
quite
a
drinkable
beer
if
it
wasnt
8
a
330ml
bottle
the
beer
as
it
evacuates
the
dark
brown
bottle
pours
a
deep
incarnadine
color
with
a
majestic
crown
of
tan
upon
that
body
the
consistency
creamy
and
the
residual
lace
a
thick
and
clinging
sheet
that
obfuscates
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
fresh
and
crisp
hints
of
over
ripe
fruit
cherries
comes
to
mind
bit
of
oak
also
noted
a
real
treat
for
the
olfactory
and
ocular
senses
start
is
sweet
and
malt
laden
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
benign
in
its
acidity
the
hops
spicy
and
pleasant
with
the
aftertaste
lingering
long
upon
the
palate
a
true
work
of
the
brewers
art
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
a
long
sour
fruity
finish
this
brew
is
medium
heavy
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
this
brew
is
for
slow
drinking
session
late
at
night
but
drinking
more
than
one
would
be
tough
pours
a
deep
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
stiff
head
and
lots
of
lace
aroma
of
stinky
feet
and
whiffs
of
fruit
first
taste
is
so
sour
that
it
jolts
you
then
it
settles
down
and
you
sense
layers
of
fruit
and
malt
no
hop
presence
at
all
puckering
sourness
balanced
by
some
malty
sweetness
in
the
finish
full
mouthfeel
and
lots
of
carbonation
extremely
refreshing
despite
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
nyc
pours
dark
ruby
reddish
cloudy
and
murky
nose
of
must
and
old
feet
classic
belgian
puffy
head
and
leaves
nice
sheets
of
lacing
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
those
lacking
a
sense
of
palate
adventure
intense
flavors
of
sour
cherries
and
sweet
malts
give
this
one
excellent
complexity
some
nuts
some
stinky
cheese
and
some
of
this
stuff
and
youre
all
set
up
for
a
flavor
extravaganza
wow
immediately
you
notice
its
wicked
viscosity
i
wondered
if
it
was
liquid
bread
the
head
was
wonderful
though
a
bit
disconcerting
as
areas
of
different
color
and
texture
appeared
as
i
let
the
head
settle
the
smell
of
it
was
almost
like
barleywine
though
not
too
overpowering
the
taste
was
magnificent
very
well
balanced
you
can
taste
the
woodtones
immediately
but
the
aftertaste
is
very
pleasant
smooth
the
only
thing
that
put
me
off
a
bit
was
the
mouthfeel
like
you
almost
had
to
coax
the
beer
ouot
of
the
glass
halfway
to
yogurt
it
felt
at
times
though
it
mellowed
out
on
the
tongue
all
around
worth
fighting
through
it
at
least
once
man
up
beautiful
head
very
dense
and
lasting
dark
brown
purple
color
body
with
some
orange
reflects
the
smell
is
very
sour
like
vinegar
with
maybe
a
surprizing
chocolate
aspect
and
some
cheesecake
aromas
the
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
one
would
expect
bread
like
very
citric
oranges
a
sangria
like
aspect
that
also
appears
in
the
smell
becomes
more
and
more
noticeable
red
wine
and
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
thanks
to
the
long
lasting
head
almost
melting
in
the
mouth
i
had
this
beer
before
but
it
was
a
bit
too
cold
today
i
served
it
at
a
higher
temperature
and
it
revealed
a
more
interesting
variety
of
aromas
and
flavors
than
just
the
basic
sourness
one
would
expect
dark
burgandy
with
a
lively
pale
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
like
a
fruit
basket
with
peaches
and
green
apples
and
grapes
theres
also
a
slight
vinegariness
in
there
the
flavor
is
more
tart
than
i
expected
giving
the
fruits
life
a
bit
of
wine
theres
some
spice
or
herb
in
there
that
is
slipping
my
mind
slick
on
the
tongue
this
one
takes
a
bit
to
get
used
to
but
it
improves
as
you
sip
it
the
aftertaste
was
was
sweeter
than
i
prefer
in
a
flanders
red
but
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
happily
for
its
own
sake
and
the
enjoyment
that
i
would
experience
from
it
theres
a
very
strange
effect
creating
the
head
on
this
beer
that
ive
never
seen
it
looks
like
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
gather
in
clumps
in
the
bottom
of
my
tulip
glass
when
enough
have
stuck
together
they
rise
in
a
big
gob
through
the
beer
to
join
the
small
tan
head
its
a
little
disconcerting
at
first
seeing
these
pale
gobs
rising
the
beer
itself
is
dark
redbrown
and
clear
swoopy
thick
thick
lacing
loads
of
fresh
bread
waft
out
of
the
glass
tangy
sweet
toffee
alcohol
prunes
sour
fruit
that
might
be
one
of
the
fullest
aromas
ever
the
beer
starts
spicy
with
tangy
fruit
and
toffee
the
middle
is
thick
sweet
fruity
creamy
theres
almost
a
little
chocolate
the
finish
is
bready
with
sweet
cherries
and
a
dry
edge
to
it
this
is
just
one
fruity
bready
sweet
beer
rich
flavorful
i
cant
really
think
of
anything
it
compares
to
but
i
really
like
it
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
the
breadiness
and
cream
are
great
this
is
one
of
my
top
ten
favorite
beers
this
is
a
great
beer
not
just
in
this
style
extremely
drinkable
an
absolute
must
try
beer
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
flanders
red
and
i
find
this
beer
to
be
interesting
that
being
said
it
reminds
me
too
much
of
fizzy
wine
or
perhaps
a
wine
cooler
mixed
with
champagne
just
not
the
sort
of
thing
i
normally
go
for
ill
try
a
few
more
examples
of
the
style
and
revisit
this
some
day
dark
reddish
brown
witha
chunky
light
tan
head
aroma
is
sharply
sour
and
a
touch
fruity
vinegar
scent
is
almost
overpowering
flavor
is
much
less
potent
than
the
aroma
suggests
very
complex
with
many
flavors
hiding
under
the
press
of
sourness
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
definitly
woth
a
try
but
it
gets
to
be
a
real
chore
to
drink
an
overwhelming
fruit
presence
so
much
so
that
it
resembles
a
lambic
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
but
this
is
not
balanced
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
too
off
flavor
for
a
belgian
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
flanders
red
ale
i
like
it
a
lot
but
doubt
that
i
could
distinguish
this
from
a
good
fruit
lambic
in
a
blind
tasting
the
wood
aged
character
is
the
most
obvious
difference
just
a
little
on
the
tart
side
as
for
drinkability
ng
pours
with
a
twofinger
white
head
leaving
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
a
good
lace
clear
deep
reddish
amber
nose
is
raisin
tastes
of
raisins
and
apricots
smooth
with
sweetness
but
has
a
slightly
tart
finish
complex
sweet
and
sour
a
330ml
bottle
was
3
50
from
colonial
liquors
acton
ma
first
sip
gives
an
average
bodied
brew
with
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
a
slighty
syrupyness
in
texture
the
flavor
is
very
tart
with
sour
cherries
and
granny
smith
apples
coming
out
the
cherries
dominate
though
the
finish
is
very
sour
and
slightly
drying
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wish
there
were
some
other
examples
of
this
style
floating
around
ct
damn
this
is
an
interesting
beer
granted
this
was
my
first
time
ive
tried
a
flanders
red
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
poured
out
like
thick
cough
syrup
dark
ruby
with
lots
of
carbonation
smell
at
first
it
was
like
soy
sauce
but
once
you
keep
whiffing
it
it
smells
like
wine
somewhat
cheeries
and
plums
comes
to
mind
when
smelling
taste
was
unique
beginning
is
tart
sweet
and
sour
very
complexed
once
the
sourness
goes
away
fruits
hit
the
palate
with
some
woody
finish
to
it
finishes
very
dry
to
my
surprise
worth
trying
out
drinkability
id
drink
a
six
pack
every
day
if
i
could
afford
it
awesome
representation
of
the
style
not
as
mouth
puckeringly
sour
as
others
quite
a
treat
theres
a
good
deal
that
i
like
here
but
it
fails
to
coalesce
into
an
enjoyable
beverage
its
actually
the
sweetness
here
rather
than
the
sourness
that
makes
me
wince
although
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
particular
style
i
will
try
and
judge
this
one
fairly
11
2oz
bottle
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
slight
off
white
head
that
stays
around
smell
is
of
nuts
and
sourness
interesting
mix
here
the
taste
is
to
put
it
lightly
interesting
but
i
like
it
there
is
an
upfront
fruity
sourness
that
lets
the
fruit
linger
and
then
the
sweetness
comes
in
and
finishes
nicely
with
some
nutty
tastes
i
taste
cherries
for
sure
but
theres
some
other
kinds
of
fruit
in
there
as
well
i
think
lots
of
carbonation
but
its
done
rather
nicely
its
definitly
a
different
tasting
beer
but
its
very
enjoyable
none
the
less
flavor
is
nicely
sour
and
acidic
but
certainly
not
overdone
begins
to
sweeten
as
it
warms
and
some
very
fruity
flavors
come
out
particularly
cherries
mouthfeel
is
perfection
smooth
crisp
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
tartness
in
the
finish
leaves
you
wanting
to
pour
more
of
that
big
bottle
as
the
handsome
man
has
said
in
his
review
below
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
but
youll
never
know
unless
you
try
it
the
duchesse
has
a
crisp
start
with
some
tingly
carbonation
she
then
smoothes
out
to
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
body
is
mediumfull
the
sour
flavor
is
awesome
it
is
big
bold
and
absolutely
beautiful
the
fruit
flavor
and
touch
of
spices
balance
just
enough
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
pure
vinegar
i
think
that
this
balance
is
perfect
it
may
be
the
fact
that
i
have
had
no
other
samples
of
this
style
but
it
really
does
the
trick
for
me
it
is
interesting
and
complex
and
that
sour
bite
keeps
me
wanting
more
this
will
certainly
become
a
regular
whenever
i
feel
like
having
a
good
brew
i
get
one
every
time
i
go
to
eulogy
and
now
i
have
750s
to
enjoy
at
home
this
beer
is
definitely
not
for
everyone
so
if
you
don
t
like
it
send
it
to
me
its
hard
for
me
to
call
this
beer
very
drinkable
its
certainly
not
meant
to
be
quaffed
in
a
few
gulps
and
quite
frankly
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
myself
return
to
it
very
often
i
imagine
it
would
pair
rather
nicely
with
food
given
its
winelike
qualities
either
way
though
its
an
experience
worth
having
mouthfeel
bubbly
crisp
and
syrupy
im
salivating
like
pavlovs

a
reddish
brown
with
no
head
and
only
a
bit
of
a
foam
layer
looks
similar
to
thr
vichtenaar
i
just
had
slightly
acidic
aroma
with
notes
of
rotten
cherries
and
peppercorns
quite
spicy
body
is
lively
with
carbonation
and
with
a
crisp
somewhat
dry
finish
flavor
is
sweet
and
sour
with
slight
vinegar
and
acidic
notes
some
sour
fruit
also
in
the
mix
overall
much
better
than
the
vichtenaar
in
my
opinion
and
has
some
good
flavor
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
it
does
not
appear
to
bee
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
a
style
of
itself
an
interesting
experience
the
only
drawback
i
get
a
bad
case
of
the
burps
and
they
arent
good
burps
like
hops
burps
burp
not
real
drinkable

good
but
due
to
many
factors
not
very

a
case
of
these
would
last
you
a
very
long
time
dark
ale
with
a
very
small
head
that
disappears
swiftly
a
smell
of
fruits
i
cant
quite
all
identifydark

with

as
it
enters

sour

notes

oak
comes
back
in
the
aftertaste
that
remains

all
in
all
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
i
just
cant
help
thinking
it
tastes
a
little
too
much
like
wine
gone
south
not
altogether
unenjoyable
but
one
is
plenty
an
easy
pour
produced
a
giant
fine
bubbled
brownish
tan
head
sits
atop
the
deep
dark
burgandy
colored
beer
good
solid
lacing
when
the
head
finally
subsides
sour
vinegar
aroma
along
with
some
spicy
mustard
in
the
background
tart
sour
apple
and
cherry
flavor
along
with
a
very
metalic
taste
i
hate
vinegar
and
the
aroma
is
killing
me
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
damn
good
as
long
as
i
hold
my
nose
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
kriek
version
of
quelque
chose
medium
to
light
body
soft
mouthfeel
and
an
impressingly
clean
aftertaste
i
dont
like
the
smell
but
after
a
while
you
get
used
to
it
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
all
that
often
but
i
will
drink
again
very
nice
deep
redlight
brown
with
some
blackness
small
offwhite
head
stays
a
bit
as

but
mostly
as
a
small
ring
around
the
beer
great
upfront
sourness
in
the
aroma
with
vinegar
bright
and
alive
an
earthiness
with
acidity
flavor
is
very
wellbalanced
the
malt
flavors
come
out
as
it
warms
light
and
crisp
wonderful
bubbles
very
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
with
rodenbach
off
the
market
i
was
told
that
this
is
the
best
substitute
i
personally
couldnt
compare
the
two
of
them
though
i
do
have
an
alexander
waiting
for
another
day
but
on
its
own
this
is
a
nicely
sour
taste
thats
wellbalanced
and
doesnt
pucker
my
mouth
quite
good
and
one
id
have
on
another
day
my
wife
found
this
at
ajs
in
ahwatukee
arizona
shes
been
getting
into
belgian
beers
which
is
cool
but
she
didnt
like
this
one
and
gave
it
to
me
to
finish
id
just
finished
a
stone
ipa
when
she
handed
this
to
me
what
a
contrast
i
guess
im
not
sophisticated
enough
to
enjoy
a
glassful
of
balsamic
vinegar
thats
what
duchesse
de
bourgogne
smells
like
tastes
like
and
looks
like
apparently
this
is
suited
to
the
style
but
certainly
not
suited
to
my
taste

my
original
review
was
written
off
a
2003
vintage
so
i
thought
id
delve
into
this
delicacy
again
in
2009
the
head
didnt
come
up
the
way
it
did
before
but
otherwise
it
was
pretty
much
spot
on
i
am
always
taken
aback
when
drinking
this
ale
as
to
the
sophisticated
manner
in
which
they
bring
in
the
cloves
they
are
not
small
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
both
manage
to
sneak
in
unnoticed
at
first
then

the

with

fizzy

a

then
slowly
recedes

a
thick

the

brown
aroma
has
lots
of
sour
vinous
notes
along
side
notes
of
dark
fruits
hints
of

are
also
apparent
the
start
is
quite
sweet
and
fruity
prunes
raisins
and
cherry
notes
are
all
present
not
much
hop
bitterness
but
there
is
a
nice
sourness
that
comes
in
towards
the
end
to
balance
things
out
theres
a
dry
oaky
finish
carbonation
is
fairly
light
and
more
noticeable
towards
the
end
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
fruit
lambic
and
would
make
for
a
good
desert
beer
chinotto

slightly
vinegary
and

blended
with
the
complexity
of
a
flanders
red
oaky
and
rich
on
the

epitomizes
the
standard
of
a
flanders
red
again
slightly
red

vinegary
taste
complemented
with
a
thorough
malt
sweetness
and
a
sour
cherry
finish
not
unlike
something
like
liefmans
kriek
absolutely
drinkable
a
fine
example
of
a
substitute
for
a
red
wine
from
a
culinary
perspective
in
dishes
that
complement
red
wines
dark
red
brew
with
a
medium
head
sour
taste
with
a
distinct
cherry
flavor
which
is
coming
from
the
oak
very
impressive
control
of
the
flemish
style
alcohol
taste
is
not
evident
at
all
i
could
drink
this
at
any
point
in
time
one
of
the
best
flemish
sour
ales
that
ive
had
the
chance
to
taste
drinkability
never
would
have
thought
i
would
enjoy
something
of
this
style
this
much
please
be
open
to
trying
this
one
drinkability
the
beer
was
decent
but
i
would
only
question
the
how
often
would
i
actually
sit
down
to
drink
this
beer
i
aprreciate
it
but
i
dont
love
it
this
is
beer
it
tasted
and
smelled
more
like
a
wine
than
it
did
a
beer
and
therefore
it
was
very
much
not
to
my
liking
it
poured
a
large
sized
tan
frothy
head
that
consisted
of
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
was
opaque
and
carbonated
with
a
red
hue
the
nose
reminded
me
of
pure
wine
as
did
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
tangy
bitey
and
medium
bodied
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
this
beer
i
knew
i
should
have
purchased
the
4pack
when
i
saw
it
reddish
brown
color
with
a
khaki
head
that
becomes
frothy
after
agitation
some
nice
trails
of
lace
remain
on
the
glass
nose
is
oaky
and
buttery
with
some
subdued
fruity
esters
the
nose
to
me
screams
california
chardonnay
with
that
big
buttery
oaky
profile
and
this
is
just
on
aroma
tastewise
this
doesnt
deviate
too
far
from
that
california
chardonnay
once
again
buttery
oaky
and
vanilla
notes
give
way
to
a
tart
green
apple
finish
with
notes
of
vinegar
and
funkiness
a
wonderful
interplay
of
sweet
and
sour
one
of
the
most
vinous
beers
ive
consumed
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
carbonated
yet
quite
smooth
this
is
an
extraordinarily
crafted
oud
bruin
not
quite
as
quenching
as
the
goudenband
but
it
seemed
to
be
more
flavorful
with
a
fuller
finish
wonderful
stuff
deep
ruby
color
medium
head
aroma
is
slightly
vinegar
and
malts
this
is
definitely
a
flemish
sour
ale
a
big
bold
sour
tartness
up
front
gives
way
to
a
nice
vinous
fruitiness
somewhere
in
the
middle
fruity
and
sour
and
vinegar
and
sweet
all
at
the
same
time
very
reminiscent
of
a
rodenbach

very
complex

beer
i
had
forgotten
how
much

enjoyed

thanks
marc77
once
again
youve
picked
a
winner
for
me
a
nice
burgundy
color
quite
clear
and
pours
with
almost
no
head
tastes
lightly
sour
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
smells
lightly
woody
and
a
bit
sour
as
well
this
beer
tastes
tart
with
a
hint
of
cherry
a
much
more
everyday
easy
drinking
version
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
maybe
some
hints
of
vanilla
in
the
taste
followed
by
a
bit
of
tannic
background
no
bitterness
just
a
wonderful
marriage
of
tart
and
sweet
flavors
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
this
is
one
strange
beer
that
doesnt
really
fit
into
what
i
normally
call
beer
came
in
a
bottle
like
a
beer
looked
like
a
beer
but
nothing
else
anyway
to
the
review
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
very
little
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
and
was
full
of
apples
or
possibly
grapes
smelled
just
like
a
very
fruity
red
wine
i
saw
where
someone
else
who
rated
this
one
said
it
smelled
of
apples
im
not
sure
i
thought
it
was
grapes
at
the
time
but
i
cant
go
back
and
resmell
it
to
find
out
for
sure
the
taste
was
very
much
like
the
aroma
sweet
and
full
of
apple
or
grape
flavors
tasted
like
a
wine
with
a
carbonation
bite
and
a
little
beermalt
gotta
say
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
as
the
drinkabily
was
very
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
the
same
very
wierd
but
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
i
am
impressed
by
the
depth
and
quality
of
this
beer
surely
it
is
no
easy
task
to
put
all
of
those
tastes
together
i
wish
i
liked
this
beer
if
i
bought
twelve
bottles
in
january
and
opened
one
per
month
for
a
year
by
december
i
might
be
able
to
finish
one
still
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
be
able
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
what
a
unique
little
brew
much
too
sweet
for
everyday
use
but
with
completely
unmatched
complexities
to
the
taste
id
sell
my
soul
for
an
exact
ingredients
list
ive
never
tasted
anything
like
it
charging
out
of
the
bottle
with
champagnelike
carbonation
its
a
very
eyepleasing
brown
with
garnet
highlights
a
fine
tan
head
full
of
little
bubbles
lays
on
top
of
the
beer
to
the
end
the
smell
is
somewhat
musty
with
hints
of
ripe
fruit
and
an
overriding
sourness
one
sip
immediately
causes
the
mouth
to
pucker
but
thats
not
the
end
of
the
story
raisiny
sweetness
balances
the
sour
aspect
of
the
beer
making
for
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
for
a
fairly
sour
beer
this
one
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
i
found
myself
having
to
resist
the
urge
to
throw
down
big
gulps
of
it
nice
brownish
color
reveals
the
deep
center
of
a
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
the
generous
head
is
colalike
and
quickly
fades
back
to
a
mess
of
foamy
islands
the
aroma
is
sickly
pungent
strong
sweet
redolence
vinegar
and
cherries
the
flavors
are
engaging
and
complex
though
awfully
sweet
a
light
sourness
more
acetic
than
tart
is
buried
beneath
an
avalanche
of
cherries
light
vanilla
and
honey
roasted
cashews
almost
like
a
beer
sundae
with
layers
of
sweet
and
varying
flavors
it
could
use
another
kick
of
sourness
to
balance
just
a
tiny
bit
nonetheless
its
quite
an
enjoyable
offering
and
not
to
be
missed
at
first
the
aromas
are
just
steely
and
clean
but
as
it
warms
up
there
is
a
pronounced
apple
brandy
scent
with
notes
of
ginger
snap
on
the
side
the
texture
is
fizzy
and
cleanly
sweet
with
more
fresh
fruit
essences
on
the
way
down
mediumbodied
and
complex
with
shifting
layers
of
damp
earth
barrel
fermented
pickles
caramel
apples
and
burned
slate
in
the
background
very
drinkable
hooch
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
was
tart
and
vinegary
sour
overtones
on
the
taste
with
vinegar
hints
and
red
wine
hints
and
just
a
nice
tartness
throughout
with
a
woody
overtone
on
the
end
maybe
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
very
interesting
for
a
change
of
pace
thin
head
that
subsided
quickly
for
a
flemish
ale
i
must
have
not
poured
it
right
as
i
was
carefull
to
omit
the
yeast
color
as
deep
and
crimson
as
red
wine
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
no
malt
or
hops
to
be
found
flavor
is
crazy
with
the
high
soft
carbonation
causing
the
sour
beer
to
attack
my
taste
buds
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
sour
flavors
this
is
a
blend
of
an
eight
month
and
eighteen
month
old
ale
the
body
is
light
but
the
carbonation
gives
an
added
boost
to
the
strength
of
the
flavors
very
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
to
expand
the
horizons
of
beer
flavors

oz
originally
sampled
on
draught
20
march
2002
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
tasted
it
is
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
but
light
in
body
the
balance
between
sweet
tart
is
excellent
i
would
have
it
again
it
has
a
wonderful
fruity
aroma
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
any
novice
beer
drinkers
but
its
a
must
try
for
any
serious
beer
drinker
i
am
still
a
little
new
to
flemish
sour
ales
rodenbach
alexander
being
the
only
other
one
i
have
tried
so
far
from
what
i
understand
both
are
good
examples
of
the
style
that
being
the
case
i
am
fairly
certain
this
is
not
a
style
i
am
a
big
fan
of
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
with
a
thick
multicolored
head
beige
with
light
brown
splotches
with
thin
lacing
aroma
is
alternatingly
fruity
and
sour
the
flavor
actually
reminded
me
of
some
ohio
buckeye
brown
that
i
tried
not
too
long
ago
that
had
gone
way
past
the
best
by
date
tart
and
vinegary
flavor
is
tangy
throughout
the
finish
is
like
an
oaky
merlot
i
was
able
to
drink
most
of
this
in
small
doses
but
i
just
cant
appreciate
the
style
with
a
slight
tingle
on
the
tongue
a
thin
and
watery
body
and
a
moderate
length
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
lightly
dry
turning
to
a
bud
salivating
end
quite
interesting
as
it
lingered
in
my
mouth
for
awhile

like
the
taste
its
calmly
complex
very
interesting
must
be
great
with
food
if
you
enjoy
quality
red
wines
like
myself
check
this
out
hop
heads
and
fans
of
big
tasting
beers
might
find
it
boring
or
too
sweet
duchesse
de
bourgogne
a
reddish
beer
sitting
under
an
initially
thick
offwhite
head
great
thick
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
cherries
the
taste
is
very
remarkable
mixed
sweet
and
sour
that
is
almost
candy
like
unfortunately
there
is
an
unmistakable
vinegar
tastearoma
that
is
present
throughout
the
taste
is
very
intense
and
complex
before
i
forget
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
leaves
almost
a
cabernet
impression
some
sharp
alcohol
sensations
as
well
overall
the
sweetness
kills
this
brew
for
me
but
id
give
it
too
a
wine
drinker
to
show
them
what
they
are
missing
purplish
brown
in
color
with
a
initally
huge
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
of
vinegar
was
not
appropriate
much
sweeter
than
should
be
the
case
for
the
style
very
remniscent
of
a
liefmans
lambic
in
that
respect
quite
enjoyable
but
nothing
outstanding
may
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
a
lot
of
people
as
it
doesnt
have
the
harsh
acidity
that
most
new
sour
ale
drinkers
get
shocked
by
f
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
flemish
sour
ale
and
i
was
blown
away
it
pours
with
a
deep
ruby
color
and
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
red
wine
vinegar
some
may
be
turned
off
by
the
tart
acidic
tast
but
i
love
it
tastes
of
ripe
cherries
and
red
wine
with
that
vinegarlike
sourness
this
is
a
style
of
beer
i
wish
i
could
see
more
of
deep
and
murky
garnethued
brown
body
thick
1
5
foamy
head
retention
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
plenty
of
lace
left
floating
on
top
along
with
a
bit
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
vinous
a
little
too
much
in
fact
and
fruity
raspberry
with
a
hint
of
sourness
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
present
but
hidden
deeply
under
the
fruitiness
rich
moderately
sour
raspberry
flavor
solid
backing
of
caramel
malt
becomes
more
noticeable
as
the
brew
warms
towards
room
temperature
sourness
also
seems
to
pleasantly
increase
after
warming
a
bit
smooth
creamy
mouthful
leaves
an
oily
coating
in
the
mouth
excellent
brew
a
style
that
i
find
goes
extremely
well
with
game
birds
pheasant
especially
beautiful
slightly
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
carbonation
though
seemingly
energetic
at
the
pour
is
actually
quite
soft
i
could
and
would
if
it
were
a
little
less
expensive
drink
this
all
night
its
fantastic
amazing
ethereal
even
ive
run
out
of
adjectives
im
flat
out
in
love
with
this
beer
drinkability
pretty
good
if
you
can
stand
the
sourness
i
like
it
and
would
have
no
problem
pairing
this
with
a
good
meal
that
would
complement
its
dry
nature
dark
brown
and
hazy
beer
with
stick
white
lace
on
top
aroma
consists
of
malt
vinegar
cherries
and
some
toasted
malt
during
the
first
sip
its
hard
not
to
jolted
by
the
pervasive
sourness
after
that
first
sip
tough
the
whole
beer
comes
into
focus
the
sour
is
nicely
balanced
by
mediumbodied
roasty
malt
very
active
carbonation
but
the
bubbles
were
small
enough
so
that
the
effervescence
didnt
get
in
the
way
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
as
it
warmed
a
bit
very
rich
flavor
with
storng
sourness
balancing
it
out
complex
malt
flavor
with
raisnes
caramel
and
toffee
excellent
oak
character
adds
nice
complexity
and
gives
a
port
like
character
when
combined
with
oxidized
malt
richness
sourness
is
a
bit
simplistic
but
balances
out
the
flavor
very
well
a
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
sour
ale
very
rodenbach
like
a
little
less
complex
but
very
nice
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
red
color
and
formed
an
amazing
huge
pillow
like
head
that
left
some
very
amazing
laticed
like
lace
heavy
and
beautiful
style
carbonation
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
winebut
not
sure
of
style
a
flavor
of
malt
wine
and
cherries
the
finish
was
rather
tart
brought
on
by
the
heavy
carb
and
the
wine
aspect
no
doubt
it
was
the
finish
that
hurt
this
beer
in
the
end
from
getting
a
higher
rating
from
me
i
felt
it
hurt
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
worth
trying
while
i
looked
the
looks
of
this
beer
unfortunately
that
is
where
the
good
parts
end
smell
was
an
initial
sour
smell
while
many
who
review
this
smell
vinegar
i
agree
but
also
think
it
smelled
spoiled
and
rancid
very
musty
smell
the
taste
was
like
a
very
sour
chimay
red
definite
vinegarwine
notes
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
other
2
people
who
sampled
it
with
me
had
the
same
opinion
i
could
never
drink
a
full
glass
of
this
relatively
clear
rubybrown
thin
layer
of
tan
foam
aroma
consists
of
sour
unripe
fruit
and
balsamic
vinegar
notes
vinous
and
champagnelike
some
sour
cherries
poke
through
very
dry
a
unique
style
indeed
this
brew
redeemed
itself
somewhat
as
it
neared
room
temperature
do
not
attempt
to
drink
this
right
from
the
fridge
another
beautiful
example
of
a
flemish
red
ale
when
you
first
open
the
bottle
you
are
hit
with
that
sour
cherrylactic
acid
aroma
it
has
always
amazed
me
that
there
are
no
cherries
in
these
red
ales
the
color
is
a
beautiful
dried
cherry
red
with
lots
of
sparkle
and
a
rich
creamy
vanillawhite
head
the
floralsour
aroma
is
just
pure
heaven
i
have
never
found
the
right
words
for
this
aroma
the
taste
starts
out
tart
and
ends
sour
with
hints
of
sweetness
i
only
wish
this
ale
was
a
wee
bit
more
tart
with
the
sourness
lasting
a
bit
longer
its
not
quite
a
rodenbach
but
its
a
very
nice
example
of
a
red
ale
and
very
drinkable
the
publican
when
i
ordered
a
pint
said
you
remember
the
first
time
you
had
sex
this
is
better
its
not
but
its
still
one
outstanding
brew
carefully
poured
from
a
longstanding
bottle
its
a
surprisingly
clear
reddishbrown
with
orangeish
highlights
the
light
tan
head
rises
up
full
at
first
but
thins
shortly
the
thin
cap
however
holds
to
the
end
of
the
serving
no
doubt
buoyed
by
effervescent
carbonation
and
leaves
some
noteable
lace
the
aroma
is
soft
with
sugary
sweet
dark
fruit
cherry
raspberry
plum
and
an
array
of
gentle
lactic
notes
including
vinegar
leather
and
barnyard
its
also
a
touch
of
vegetal
character
and
the
combination
of
sugar
sweet
and
vinegar
leaves
it
with
a
note
thats
oddly
similar
to
ketchup
its
not
bad
but
its
sweeter
more
chalky
and
much
less
sour
than
many
of
the
examples
from
the
historic
town
of
oudenaarde
the
body
is
light
but
with
some
dextrins
and
offers
a
crisp
and
zesty
mouthfeel
from
a
very
fine
effervescent
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
with
a
combination
of
tart
sharp
fruit
raisin
raspberry
prune
currant
sour
cherry
and
sweetish
caramelized
sugar
at
the
front
of
the
mouth
leading
into
a
more
winey
character
with
a
big
woody
note
and
sweet
maltiness
at
mid
swallow
it
finishes
a
bit
chalky
and
dry
with
a
light
stickiness
throughout
the
mouth
and
a
sweet
tart
note
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
sometimes
followed
by
an
earthy
musty
and
acidic
burp
a
very
good
beer
in
the
oud
bruin
style
posessing
a
solid
oak
character
and
good
fruitiness
but
possibly
a
touch
sweet
overall
quite
enjoyable
deep
crimson
hued
with
a
light
haze
topped
by
a
moderate
off
white
head
that
leaves
respectable
lace
very
tart
unripe
fruit
dominates
the
aroma
but
a
constant
undertone
of
wet
horse
brettanomyces
and
old
cheesy
hops
counter
the
initial
tartness
nicely
the
flavor
consists
of
a
pleasant
blend
of
tart
lactic
notes
and
unripe
raspberry
offset
by
high
residual
sweetness
due
to
the
paltry
hop
bitterness
sour
acidity
is
present
as
a
constant
from
start
to
finish
light
in
body
and
spritzy
in
mouthfeel
finishes
w
tartness
abruptly
ending
and
sugary
sweetness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
slowly
fading
this
brew
exhibits
a
good
balance
of
lactobacillus
tartness
fruity
esters
and
residual
sweetness
the
taste
grew
on
me
the
more
i
sipped
more
wild
yeast
character
would
have
added
additional
complexity
nice
red
hue
to
this
brew
but
either
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
what
i
dont
know
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
was
a
taste
of
a
sweet
and
sour
wine
flavor
through
out
the
whole
glass
of
beer
i
got
a
sweet
rasin
flavor
followed
with
a
sour
after
taste
no
thanks
to
his
brew
what
an
exceptional
fanders
red
good
head
maltywiney
aroma
and
sweet
tart
flavor
makes
this
beer
a
real
winner
for
the
style
with
the
sporatic
supply
of
rodenbach
these
days
it
is
nice
to
know
there
is
another
flanders
red
one
can
turn
to
excellent
and
very
fun
little
brew
deep
brwon
with
atinge
of
red
nice
pillowy
head
with
good
lace
aroma
is
of
cherry
balsamic
vinegar
and
perhaps
a
bit
winey
palate
is
slightly
sweet
most
mostly
tart
sweet
and
then
sourness
aswell
fruity
quite
comlex
and
very
enjoyable
deep
brownish

colour
with
some
haze
from
both
the
chill
and
yeast
tight
off
white
lace
with
a
half
decent

within
the

puckering
twang
of

hits
the

fruity
flavours
ride
along
with
this
and
give
suggestions
of
ripe
currant
and
apple
peel
a
woody
dryness
sneaks
up
and
dries
the
mouth
is
a
split
second
and
clear
all
residual

quite
the
enjoyable
flemish
red
beautiful
rubyred
color
with
a
wispy
lace
head
the
oaken
cask
conditioning
of
this
beer
give
the
drinker
hints
of
balsamic
and
red
wine
vinegar
with
some
sweetness
and
floral
notes
of
wine
while
you
are
trying
to
put
a
finger
on
all
the
flavors
you
start
tasting
the
sweet
and
chewier
texture
of
the
malt
this
beer
is
slightly
sour
and
very
highly
carbonated
pleasantly
so
similar
to
a
lambic
this
is
bottled
happiness
this
particular
sample
was
brought
over
from
belgium
in
032000
like
other
flanders
reds
this
beer
was
also
aged
in
oaken
casks
pours
a
darker
reddish
tinted
brown
moderate
cap
of
off
white
head
decent
retention
scent
brings
berries
tart
cherry
red
wine
and
apple
cider
vinegar
lightly
herbal
and
medicinal
first
sip
brings
blended
vinegar
and
berry
notes
can
pick
out
each
individually
but
quite
even
in
the
taste
tangy
and
tart
lightly
sweet
medium
bodied
a
splash
bubbly
not
as
bold
on
the
cherry
front
as
i
had
hoped
mild
vinegar
and
bright
berry
notes
a
giant
taste
of
fruit
cherry
and
strawberries
with
a
good
souracid
balance
this
isnt
that
sour
at
all
actually
and
is
extremely
palatable
and
just
the
right
amount
of
minimal
carbonation
with
perfect
abv
drinkability
just
flat
out
great
to
drink
and
i
would
have
another
instantly
pleasant
prickly
mouthfeel
pretty
dry
and
refreshing
damn
good
and
drinkable
d
nice
stuff
this
beer
is
tart
ill
go
ahead
and
call
it
sour
but
really
its
tart
its
the
kind
of
sour
that
makes
you
pucker
your
lips
or
when
you
feel
it
in
the
corners
of
your
mouth
its
serious
sour
tart
i
can
detect
some
sweetness
in
there
through
the
sour
still
the
cherries
are
subtle
in
the
flavor
but
you
can
tell
they
are
there
beer
is
medium
bodied
finishes
completely
this
is
another
palate
cleansing
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
phenomenal
i
did
not
think
i
would
like
it
but
im
glad
i
had
one
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
is
nice
theres
woody
astringency
sour
milk
light
horseblanket
sweet
this
is
pretty
thin
not
so
dryvery
fruit
juicy
served
in
a
wine
glass
this
is
a
nice
deep
purplish
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
and
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
a
strong
cherry
smell
kind
of
like
a
cough
drop
with
a
slight
oak
scent
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
very
strong
cherry
more
tart
that
sweet
doesnt
leave
a
lingering
syrpupy
aftertaste
hard
to
taste
much
other
than
the
cherry
although
there
is
a
decent
malt
underlying
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
fairly
high
carbonation
and
a
light
effervescent
feel
in
the
motuh
the
only
other
kriek
ive
had
was
lindemans
and
this
is
definitely
a
better
beer
goes
well
with
desert
especially
chocolate
drinkable
ill
pass
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
bit
better
than
vichtenaar
and
on
par
with
the
duchesse
in
my
estimation
all
three
definitely
worth
a
try
pulled
a
2
5
year
old
bottle
from
the
cellar
and
am
drinking
it
one
day
before
its
best
by
date
even
after
some
age
it
still
has
a
very
big
cherry
nose
with
touches
of
sweet
and
tart
and
a
hint
of
fresh
compost
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
i
have
seen
it
pours
a
lively
brilliant
cherry
under
a
very
rocky
pure
white
1
foam
cap
very
rich
cherry
palate
with
herbal
black
cherries
lemony
tartness
and
over
ripe
fruit
while
there
is
sweetness
in
the
background
there
is
an
overall
dryness
and
a
balancing
tartness
the
beer
is
effervescent
with
a
fine
bead
midrange
between
sweet
and
sour
well
balanced
and
put
together
mild
sour
but
just
the
right
amount
of
cherries
anyone
who
likes
de
garde
or
fruity
beers
will
love
this
dont
want
to
do
a
full
review
but
in
short
sweet
cherry
nail
polish
o
while
i
would
liken
this
more
to
a
straight
up
kriek
lambic
due
to
the
intense
sweetness
the
oak
certainly
comes
through
and
merely
makes
for
a
less
malty
flanders
red
absolutely
fantastic
o
4
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
good
cherry
flavor
and
a
pleasant
tartness
there
could
be
more
lactic
sourness
but
the
vanilla
and
oak
flavors
make
this
seem
like
a
flanders
red
with
cherries
which
is
still
okay
in
my
book
this
is
a
very
good
kriek
certainly
not
in
the
top
tier
but
very
tasty
it
could
use
a
little
more
sweetness
and
certainly
more
funk
carrying
over
to
the
flavor
and
the
metallic
hint
in
the
flavor
takes
away
from
it
a
bit
a
really
nice
cherrybeer
both
sweet
and
sour
with
an
amazing
aftertaste
overall
this
is
simply
my
kind
of
beer
it
is
no
secret
that
i
love
krieks
and
cherry
beers
in
general
and
this
is
a
damn
tasty
example
of
one
many
stars
nice
slightly
unique
version
of
the
style
would
i
drink
again
yup
and
id
probably
buy
one
again
being
it
didnt
seem
sweetened
o
for
claiming
to
be
good
up
to
almost
3
years
ago
id
say
this
is
probably
a
good
one
to
try
the
cherry
is
very
very
strong
and
tart
so
if
you
dont
like
cherries
you
wont
like
this
cherry
syrup
or
concentrate
would
be
accurate
for
the
intensity
id
love
to
try
one
that
claims
to
be
within
its
exp
date
medium
to
high
carbonation
with
a
tart
cherry
note
flavor
very
present
some
wood
a
nice
pleasing
and
refreshing
sour
beer
this
is
just
ok
i
recommend
duchesse
de
bourgogne
or
cuvée
des
jacobins
rouge
if
you
want
a
12
oz
single
of
flanders
red
pours
a
beautiful
red
with
fizz
that
disappears
quickly
off
the
top
smells
like
crazy
cherry
but
not
much
beer
either
way
it
smells
good
super
sour
taste
but
it
finishes
without
much
flavor
seems
like
it
could
use
some
back
end
sweetness
to
get
the
whole
palate
involved
nice
tart
cherries
on
the
tongue
very
effervescent
a
fun
one
to
try
but
their
other
sours
are
better
like
duchesse
not
being
a
huge
sour
drinker
or
at
least
uninitiated
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
accessible
and
refreshing
strong
cherrysour
cherry
taste
more
vinegar
in
the
nose
great
late
summer
beer
to
sip
while
relaxing
in
the
shade
the
carbonation
really
made
this
beer
creep
up
on
me
and
i
really
liked
the
sensation
would
definitely
drink
again
o
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
from
the
style
flanders
red
ale
but
that
is
likely
due
to
the
cherry
sweetness
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
real
nice
beer
a
great
taste
and
very
refreshing
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
as
theres
enough
fruitiness
from
the
cherries
to
prevent
this
from
becoming
too
sour
overall
this
would
be
a
very
refreshing
summer
drink
nicely
done
overall
im
a
little
sad
i
bought
this
out
of
date
and
it
didnt
quite
have
the
cherry
punch
i
expected
other
than
that
its
a
very
good
flanders
red
for
a
very
affordable
price

a

good

to

only
slightly
less
sour
and
little
sweetness
not
a
bad
sour
at
all
just
not
exactly
excellent
either
it
was
honestly
more
tart
than
sour
which
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
nice
wood
barrel
feel
from
the
flavor
lingers
with
the
sour
cherry
notes
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
one
finger
slightly
pink
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
candied
sugar
strawberry
and
sweet
tarts
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
strawberry
cherry
sugar
cherry
syrup
and
subtle
sweet
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
will
warn
all
who
approach
this
brew
that
it
is
a
lot
more
sweet
than
some
other
krieks
out
there
this
does
cover
up
quite
a
bit
of
the
subtle
flavors
that
were
present
as
i
could
not
pick
them
out
unfortunately
for
what
they
were
aiming
for
it
really
wasnt
too
bad
if
i
honest
as
the
sweetness
did
carry
throughout
but
it
wasnt
overpowering
to
the
point
where
you
think
you
are
going
to
get
diabeetus
from
drink
a
glass
of
it
a
fairly
well
done
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
in
the
future
if
more
funky
krieks
are
not
available
at
the
time
overall
a
nice
easytodrink
sweetandsour
beer
i
would
prefer
it
just
a
bit
more
sour
and
with
a
bit
more
intensity
in
the
flavor
but
i
do
like
what
the
cherries
bring
to
this
style
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
white
head
that
has
a
tint
of
pink
in
it
light
retention
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
on
top
smells
of
sour
cherries
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
vinegar
a
light
bit
of
lactic
with
enough
sweetness
to
keep
some
balance
the
flavor
is
lots
of
tart
cherries
and
lots
of
sweet
and
brown
sugar
with
just
enough
lactic
tartness
and
a
hint
of
balsamic
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
going
on
i
love
cherries
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
on
that
front
that
being
said
as
a
flanders
red
this
one
falls
a
bit
short
for
me
it
really
needs
more
tart
this
feels
like
a
wine
cooler
to
some
extent
ill
bet
this
is
pasteurized
and
backsweetened
ala
lindemanns
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
but
the
purest
in
me
had
to
mention
its
downfalls
a
light
red
hue
with
some
pink
bubbles
not
much
in
the
lines
of
a
head
retention
or
lace
the
nose
is
of
lightly
tart
dark
cherries
lactic
sweetness
and
some
balsamic
notes
on
the
palate
balsamic
notes
hit
first
with
dark
cherries
through
the
middle
the
finish
starts
with
a
wave
of
tartness
and
then
ends
with
a
lactic
sugar
sweetness
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
for
the
style
one
of
the
more
fruit
forward
flanders
i
have
had
and
almost
to
a
fault
the
fruit
is
sugary
sweet
masking
any
true
tartness
that
might
be
present
pours
a
light
brownishred
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
recedes
leaving
a
nice
layer
of
lacing
smells
of
sour
funk
past
ripe
cherries
and
sour
grapes
first
sip
is
much
sweeter
that
the
nose
indicated
but
still
fairly
sour
the
funk
is
there
up
front
but
that
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
much
set
your
insulin
pump
for
an
additional
10
units
the
mouthfeel
on
this
puppy
is
great
as
it
is
well
carbonated
and
rather
creamy
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
10
years
on
it
as
maybe
over
time
the
sweetness
will
fade
not
my
favourite
from
this
brewery
the
flamboyant
cherry
character
is
great
as
far
as
it
goes
but
the
lack
of
flanders
red
character
makes
this
a
little
onedimensional
overall
a
pretty
easy
drink
beer
and
lip
coating
smacking
good
too
overall
i
am
surprised
so
many
people
liked
this
beer
but
i
did
not
im
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
really
misses
the
mark
the
fruit
flavor
isnt
pleasing
and
the
mouthfeel
is
way
too
light
o
definitely
sweeter
than
most
in
the
style
it
remains
incredibly
drinkable
if
you
dont
have
a
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
then
this
will
do
in
a
pinch
pours
a
clear
cranberry
juice
color
with
a
12
inch
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
and
sour
cherries
funk
and
woody
aromas
taste
is
of
sour
cherries
slight
funk
wood
and
a
medicinal
or
minerallike
taste
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
this
one
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
nice
for
the
style
but
not
particularly
my
thing
i
would
recommend
it
to
lovers
of
lambics
or
fruit
and
while
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
this
was
the
first
beer
that
my
wine
friends
enjoyed
mouthfeel
is
excellent
medium
to
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
that
makes
it
feel
almost
like
youre
drinking
some
kind
of
premium
soda
this
is
certainly
not
the
most
exciting
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
enjoyable
were
eating
it
with
steak
and
potatoes
and
it
accompanies
them
very
well
overall
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
but
not
complex
enough
to
really
be
a
favorite
drinkability
a
good
refreshing
drink
that
would
not
be
too
sweet
to
have
a
couple
nor
to
tart
less
acidic
than
a
typical
kriek
beer
its
very
drinkable
beer
surprisingly
smooth
i
would
normally
say
age
this
one
for
a
good
while
to
dry
up
the
flavor
but
i
dont
think
that
cellaring
would
change
the
beer
with
no
yeast
sediment
not
as
complex
as
the
smell
might
lead
you
to
believe
tart
kriek
cherries
dominate
the
taste
hints
of
vinegar
and
funk
are
noticeable
i
was
looking
for
more
funk
but
the
funk
level
seems
to
fit
nicely
its
still
feels
light
and
less
syrupy
than
othe
belgian
fruit
beers
a
sweet
somewhat
undercarbonated
flanders
redlacks
the
biting
stinging
wonderful
sourness
ive
come
to
expect
within
the
style
o
this
is
a
slightly
unusual
but
somehow
likable
beer
o
this
is
a
sophisticated
flanderss
that
doesnt
quite
blend
in
its
additional
ingredients
the
oak
and
cherries
lend
a
lot
to
the
flavor
but
also
combine
to
create
an
unstable
concoction
the
tartness
in
the
finish
is
really
quite
pleasant
and
refined
but
the
acid
that
comes
with
it
is
quite
overwhelming
it
may
not
be
in
the
first
few
sips
but
it
gradually
accumulates
after
getting
down
to
about
half
a
glass
i
felt
like
i
was
ready
to
tap
out
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
i
feel
like
i
just
drank
a
gallon
of
pure
lemon
juice
not
even
the
solid
flavors
can
save
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
sorry
verhaeghe
but
im
in
love
with
the
duchesse
o
while
i
dont
this
comes
near
to
the
bodysnatching
madness
of
the
duchesse
this
is
a
deliciously
complex
red
ale
that
does
stay
true
to
the
brewerys
signature
taste
yum
yum
yum
even
the
sourhating
crazies
in
this
household
enjoyed
it
a
solid
kriek
from
a
true
belgian
brewery
hits
all
the
right
notes
without
being
overwhelming
on
any
count
sweet
tart
fruity
with
a
hint
of
spice
this
beer
is
a
great
sipper
for
dessert
or
to
go
with
some
good
dark
chocolate
da
little
sweet
and
the
carbonation
level
being
a
little
low
hurts
the
drinkability
on
this
one
for
me
overall
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
this
beer
very
good
a
really
nice
variant
on
an
already
delicious
style
of
beer
absolutely
refreshing
and
a
great
treat
on
a
summer
evening
really
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
except
that
its
a
perfectly
pleasant
flanders
red
bordering
on
west
country
english
cider
opinion
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
mean
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
be
proud
to
have
brewed
a
beer
with
this
much
complexity
but
i
expected
a
little
better
when
you
hold
this
beer
up
next
to
the
duchesse
or
vichtenaar
the
medicinal
character
is
probably
the
element
that
rubs
against
me
the
most
in
this
beer
perhaps
it
is
my
fault
because
i
didnt
drink
it
right
away
i
will
hold
on
to
that
and
see
if
i
can
find
a
fresher
example
if
it
is
significantly
different
i
will
update
my
review
im
surprised
to
see
this
is
a
flemish
red
i
thought
for
sure
that
it
was
a
wild
ale
or
lambic
either
way
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
red
color
and
thats
the
only
thing
i
really
liked
about
this
beer
the
aromas
and
taste
are
similar
to
each
other
acidic
and
tart
reminded
me
of
vinegar
a
little
a
little
bit
of
funk
to
it
as
well
this
is
a
beer
for
those
who
like
this
style
i
for
one
am
not
that
much
of
a
fan
of
them
ill
give
them
all
a
try
but
i
cant
say
ill
like
them
pours
a
fairly
clear
dark
ruby
with
a
thick
wheatlike
head
that
dissappears
qutie
fast
a
bit
light
on
the
nose
slightly
vinegary
and
faint
cherry
pleasant
and
fresh
but
not
ultra
complex
taste
is
very
light
sour
and
intense
cherry
flavor
heavy
and
an
woody
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
fizzy
and
thin
very
astringent
finish
a
pleasant
beer
especially
in
the
spring
or
summer
drinkability
the
cherries
are
a
nice
addition
and
complement
rather
than
overpower
the
beer
the
smell
is
slightly
acetic
but
theres
little
vinegar
flavor
which
can
be
too
much
for
me
taste
is
similar
very
nice
fruity
acitic
raspberry
with
rich
bread
character
a
hint
of
vinegar
and
soured
fruits
some
earthiness
and
yeast
sweetsour
it
has
light
sweetness
and
light
tartness
excellent
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
has
good
depth
of
character
with
a
nice
engaging
feel
excellent
clear
red
beer
with
magnificient
pink
3finger
head
crisp
cherry
nose
cherry
taste
with
metallic
not
metallic
exactly
but
definitely
caused
by
yeast
strains
aftertones
quite
acidic
mild
fruity
mouthfeel
i
would
advise
it
as
good
dessert
drink
for
every
season
d
not
for
me
verdict
well
made
but
not
quite
elite
worth
trying
as
it
is
good
and
unique
very
drinkable
beer
would
be
a
nice
thirst
quencher
in
the
summer
time
not
quite
up
to
most
flander
reds
in
tartness
and
woodiness
very
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
again
abv
is
a
bit
high
but
treat
this
one
as
a
dessert
beer
best
enjoyed
with
something
caramelized
and
fruity
like
a
nice
fruit
tart
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
though
it
does
not
linger
too
long
wouldnt
call
much
of
it
sour
took
on
more
of
the
sweet
components
even
more
as
the
drink
went
on
worth
a
try
but
for
the
price
here
in
alberta
i
doubt
it
would
make
it
into
your
regular
rotation
good
carbonation
level
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
it
seems
that
barrel
aging
fits
this
style
of
beer
well
im
very
happy
overall
with
this
bottle
and
i
think
its
definitely
worth
the
cost
to
buy
more
in
the
future
taste
is
good
but
a
bit
disappointing
following
the
aroma
sweetness
from
the
cherries
is
kicked
up
a
notch
and
sourness
is
kicked
down
a
notch
still
a
decent
balance
but
i
liked
the
balance
in
the
aroma
a
bit
more
nice
and
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
prickly
carbonation
that
fits
the
style
and
flavor
profile
very
well
refreshing
although
the
sweetness
is
just
a
bit
high
which
hurts
the
drinkability
aroma
is
cherries
and
steely
sour
sweet
cherry
and
fairly
reserved
sour
blend
well
but
this
leans
more
to
the
sweet
side
sangria
and
bunt
spice
come
to
mind
effervescent
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
body
well
carbonated
not
sweet
but
a
lot
of
lingering
fruit
flavours
i
can
easily
drink
a
couple
interesting
edit
a
is
a
bit
much
i
had
to
knock
this
down
a
bit
bottle
best
before
date
of
101210
pours
a
reddish
tinted
mahagony
color
iwth
a
slighlty
red
head
very
effervescent
funky
cherry
and
acidic
nose
the
smell
i
actually
like
much
sweeter
in
the
taste
than
i
wold
have
expected
sweet
cherry
followed
by
funkyiness
and
then
a
slight
acidic
bite
i
could
see
people
knocking
this
for
being
to
sweet
but
i
find
it
fairly
refreshing
not
really
sour
by
any
means
light
mouthfeel
slight
taste
of
alcohol
near
the
end
pours
a
dark
red
purplish
body
with
quickly
dying
onefinger
pink
head
mostly
tart
cherries
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
funk
but
thats
about
it
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
a
lightbodied
and
smooth
beer
passes
over
my
tongue
and
i
get
a
whole
lot
of
cherries
more
sweet
than
sour
not
as
sour
or
as
complex
as
others
of
this
style
yet
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
while
more
than
one
would
probably
make
me
sick
the
one
i
had
was
real
enjoyable
drinkability
fairly
standard

with
hints
of
vanilla

acetic

not

behind
delightfully
tart
refreshing
and
full
of
cherry
but
not
without
bready
buttery
and
spicy
notes
that
evoke
apple
pie
particularly
in
the
finish
no

this
would
be
an
excellent
food
beer
especially
for
chocolate
venison
and
pork
d
very
drinkable
after
dinner
treat
a
more
refreshing
take
on
this
style
i
suppose
i
quite
like
it
but
in
moderation
the
cherry
flavor
is
just
right
and
im
very
picky
about
intentional
strong
fruit
in
anything
but
lambics
perhaps
a
good
introduction
to
this
style
for
some
ill
have
to
try
it
on
my
girlfriend
although
its
not
a
hard
beer
to
take
down
i
could
see
the
sugary
cough
syrupesque
quality
eventually
becoming
a
bit
of
a
nuisance
pours
a
clear
ruby
bordering
on
the
garnet

a
healthy
amount
of
pinkish

the
nose
is
tart
berries
sour
black
cherries
green
apple
flesh
and
some
sort
of
wood
i
cant
tell
which
though
oak
is
highly
probable
the
expected
tartness
isnt
really
there
replaced
by
a
very
blunt
sour
cherry
flavor
the
wood
returns
as
well
adding
a
nice
oaky
backdrop
to
the
proceedings
and
repelling
any
tartness
that
would
have
wanted
to
show
itself
the
body
is
a
lightly
heavy
soup
with
a
lightly
tickling
carbonation
this
did
not
turn
out
the
way
i
expected
but
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
either
just
different
thats
all
very
drinkable
style
well
suited
to
a
hot
day
nicely
put
together

on
an
flemish

looking

on

and
moves
into
cough
syrup
territory
for
me
as
it
warms
seems
a
bit
one
note
and
it
is
overall
pleasant
at
first
but
just
wears
me
down
nice
body
has
a
dry
acidic
finish
a
beer
perfectly
matched
with
its
companion
food
d
wildly
drinkable
refreshing
if
not
a
little
sweet
at
times
solid
brew
never
had
this
style
before
but
happy
i
got
to
try
it
only
downside
i
had
was
it
was
just
a
tad
high
on
the
carbonation
side
of
things
try
it
out
nicely
carbonated
with
a
finish
to
ie
for
sour
cherry
really
shines
through
at
the
entire
spectrum
bits
of
residual
sugar
hints
of
milk
chocolate
nice
funky
earth
character
and
really
well
rounded
a
pretty
approachable
sour
flemish
ale
the
fruitiness
nicely
balanced
with
the
acidity
dnice
but
a
bit
sweet
for
me
to
go
through
more
than
a
bottle
cut
the
sweetness
and
we
have
a
winner
overall
i
thought
the
sweet
and
tart
flavors
were
present
in
very
good
amounts
a
hard
feat
to
achieve
in
beers
of
this
style
well
worth
a
shot
the
sugary
sweetness
mixed
with
the
slight
vinegar
notes
drags
the
drinkability
down
somewhat
but
it
is
a
decent
brew
carbonation
is
high
and
sparkling
adding
to
the
refreshing
value
of
this
beer
very
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
d
nice
easy
drinker
quite
similar
to
a
lambic
but
not
having
the
sweetness
a
definite
repeat
d
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
flavors
are
decent
and
the
nose
is
not
too
bad
either
the
problem
is
that
there
isnt
anything
that
really
wows
me
or
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
down
and
have
another
pours
a
ruddy
mahogany
orange
not
really
the
brilliant
ruby

leaves
some
nice

lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
overripe
cherries
with
a
lactic
black
cherry
yogurt
note
and
also
some
sort
of
salty
lightly
smokey
note
flavor
is
just
about
the
same
although
the
smokey
note
proves
to
be
slightly
meaty
as
if
in
a
rauchbier
very
odd
cherries
and
ham
isnt
really
my
thing
mouthfeel
is
coarse
from
overcarbonation
but
otherwise
its
alright
the
body
was
what
was
expected
light
crisp
and
effervescent
but
perhaps
just
a
little
thinner
than
i
anticipated
drinkability
was
very
good
if
you
can
put
up
with
the
tartness
several
go
down
easily
nice
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
relatively
no
head
very
little
lacing
smell
is
a
great
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
cherry
scents
the
balance
of
sweetness
and
tart
flavors
is
great
it
starts
out
with
more
of
a
sweet
feel
that
transforms
into
a
tart
maltyness
that
lingers
for
just
the
right
amount
of
time
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
too
fizzy
for
my
preference
but
lightens
up
as
the
beer
warms
my
first
of
the
style
similiar
to
a
lambic
refreshing
brew
m
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
with
just
enough
carbonation
quite
refreshing
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
overly
sour
and
lots
of
nice
flavors
great
beer

acidic
mouthfeel
wtih
too
much
carbonation
felt
like
it
was
corroding
my
tongue
towards
the
finish
similar
to
the
feeling
after
eating
too
many
sweet
tarts
sour
cherry
flavor
that
leans
towards
sweet
tarts
again
at

it
wasnt

wished
there
was
more
of

oh
well
they

this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
spritzy
wine
and
sweet
fermented
cider
there
isnt
much
cherry
flavor
here
but
it
is
still
very
tasty
theres
a
good
chew
to
the
body
dessert
beer
this
is
deep
red
in
color
and
features
an
extremely
pleasant
aroma
of
cherry

cherry
pastries
whatever
it
is
its
awesome
to
taste
it
isnt
strongly
acidic
but
very
tart
with
the
cherries
more
cherries
appear
and
bombard
the
palate
mmmmm
im
not
a
cherry
lover
but
i
do
like
this
beer
sip
and
enjoy
d
this
beer
is
tasty
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
stuff
rather
delightful
just
dont
look
for
a
huge
complexity
the

beer
d
easy
to
drink
could
put
these
down
all
day
until
the
sour
starts
to
feedback
too
much
d
oh
so
drinkable
this
sweet
and
sour
beer
airs
on
the
side
of
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
nothing
about
this
beer
is
overpowering
just
nice
could
drink
it
all
night
drinkability
very
easy
but
too
much
of
a
fruit
beer
for
me
its
my
wifes
favorite
beer
ever
though
looking
at
the
bottle
youd
think
was
a
lambic
but
its
actually
a
flemish
red
so
the
taste
initally
caught
me
off
guard
until
i
realized
what
i
was
drinking
its
very
bitter
from
start
to
finish
with
a
very
sharp
bite
at
the
end
cherries
are
subtle
but
there
pretty
decent
flemish
red
wine
glass
55f
similar
to
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
with
that
overly
rich
ripe
cherry
flavor
but
this
beer
is
much
drier
more
funky
more
complex
more
drinkable
and
just
allaround
better
main
complaint
small
serving
size
combined
with
high
price
thats
okay
for
strong
ales
but
this
one
is
too
drinkable
to
nurse
deep
red
not
quite
opaque
with
a
small
pink
tinged
head
no
noticeable
carbonation
definite
fruit
aroma
but
not
as
pronounced
as
other
flanders
reds
or
lambics
much
less
tart
than
expected
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
finish
it
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
part
of
a
flight
of
5oz
pours
this
displayed
some
wonderful
cherry
fruit
without
being
overpowering
some
tartness
nothing
like
some
of
the
really
sour
lambics
though
so
dont
let
that
put
you
off
it
balanced
a
luncheon
sausage
perfectly
the
tartness
and
acidity
balancing
out
the
whole
plate
i
have
had
the
bottle
version
and
found
the
draft
to
be
even
more
drinkable
md
the
texture
is
full
of
fine
carbonation
visàvis
a
medium
body
for
a
6
8abv
fruitbeer
this
ale
overall
is
quite
close
to
the
performance
of
the
beer
base
the
vichtenaar
in
terms
of
integrity
and
balance
while
the
good
amount
of
cherries
used
in
the
brew
have
made
a
deep
imprint
in
the
harmonious
profile
alongside
the
unique
lactic
edge
of
the
oakaged
bruin
enjoyable
d
tasted
a
lot
like
a
cherry
infused
champagne
to
me
a
very
different
brew
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
its
lightness
makes
it
go
down
easy
i
found
it
to
be
quite
the
fun
experience
d
this
goes
down
very
easily
although
not
something
id
want
to
drink
too
fast
drinkability
i
just
had
a
duchesse
before
this
and
think
this
is
more
sour
than
that
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
will
search
for
again
and
could
have
several
in
a
sitting
a
great
starter
sour
d
off
the
charts
i
would
love
to
just
drink
up
the
4pack
right
now
not
quite
as
rich
an
experience
as
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
still
very
very
good
this
is
a
nice
sour
i
dont
understand
the
relatively
low
score
i
like
duchesse
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
think
this
blows
duchesse
out
of
the
water
i
cant
ask
for
too
much
more
out
of
this
its
a
satisfying
sour
and
then
some
if
youre
a
fan
of
flemish
ale
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
there
are
some
things
holding
it
back
but
overall
a
fine
notch
to
put
on
ones
belt
so
to
speak
12oz

interesting
beer
the
stickiness
is
a
little
much
for
my
liking
but
the
flavor
is
better
than
average
had
this
ontap
last
night
it
poured
a
deep
red
and
and
had
no
head
did
have
a
good
amount
of
visible
carbonation
though
smelled
like
fresh
cherries
and
and
touch
of
wood
aging
scents
wow
what
a
taste
the
cherry
wasnt
overpowering
because
it
was
cut
with
the
right
amount
of
sour
the
carbonation
is
perfect
i
thought
it
would
way
too
much
when
i
was
looking
at
it
i
could
sit
back
and
have
2
or
3
of
these
but
then
it
might
be
enough
very
tasty
though
another
wonderful
beer
from
the
folks
at
verhaughe

is
a
bit
too
cherry
7
up
for
my
liking

but
the
color
screams
soda
them
smell
brings
me
back
to
my
comfort
zone
as
i
realize
this
is
going
to
be
a
sour
treat
to
be
quite
honest
this
is
more
sour
than
duchesse
this
is
a
tart
cherry
sour
not
at
all
vnegary
sweet
nice
cherry
presence
but
the
sweetness
is
never
dominant
over
the
sourness
mouthfeel
is
also
completely
different
from
duchesse
more
carbonation
more
prickly
less
smooth
in
short
a
totally
different
beer
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
by
any
means
i
love
it
drinkability
is
high
it
is
dry
enough
to
drink
several
without
being
too
indulgent

if
you
are
looking
for
a
gateway
beer
into
the
world
of
sour
beers
flanders
reds
and
the
like
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
it
gives
you
an
easy
going
tartness
thats
not
too
sharp
or
acidic
and
rewards
you
with
lots
of
sweet
cherry
for
the
accustomed
sour
fiend
this
might
be
enjoyable
if
a
bit
on
the
pedestrian
side
overall
though
its
pretty
darn
drinkable
if
you
have
even
the
slightest
penchant
for
something
in
a
sour
pours
up
a
reddish
amber
with
a

the

i
could
see
myself
being
in
the
movie
the
shining
drinking
this
beer
in
a
huge
hotel
during
a
snow
storm
bottle
poured
a
deep
red
color
ale
with
a
rather
large
pink
color
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
a
load
of
cherries
with
some
notes
of
oak
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
loads
of
cherries
that
are
sour
but
also
lightly
sweet
but
some
light
sour
and
tart
notes
with
some
oak
presence
also
noticeable
full
body
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
appearance
of
alcohol
very
well
done
and
definitely
something
i
wish
i
could
get
more
often
shared
with
stumac
and
melanie
bought
from
ls
is
quite
a
sour
little
bugger
the
tartness
is
spot
on
too
lots
of
cherries
and
oak
sourness
a
delicoius
strange
enjoyable
brew
melanie
didnt
like
this
brew
not
as
people
friendly
as
some
of
this
section
you
know
what
i
mean
a
perfectly
executed
sour
fruit
beer
its
actually
sour
there
is
none
of
that
sugary
syrupy
flavour
that
makes
me
gag
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
convert
wine
drinkers
and
would
make
a
helluva
pairing
for
dessert
im
thinking
it
would
contrast
nicely
with
just
about
any
kind
of
cheesecake
overall
a
fun
sour
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
the
sweetness
and
tartness
are
a
bit
strong
but
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
fine
smooth
carbonation
with
grippy
acidity
and
spice
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
bottle
courtesy
of
tysoanderso
pours
a
dark
rose
colour
with
good
clarity
and
off
white
head
nose
is
intensely
fruity
with
cherries
blasting
through
taste
sweet
initially
with
a
woody
earthy
finish
sour
but
not
in
your
face
smells
more
sour
than
actually
is
finishes
clean
with
crisp
carbonation
quite
drinkable
very
good
but
very
sweet
i
think
i
prefer
duchess
but
this
seems
to
be
a
little
harder
to
find
so
def
check
it
out
if
you
can
find
it
pours
a
cranberry
color
with
little
head
and
a
sour
cherry
funky
guaze
smell
as
to
be
expected
taste
is
sweeter
than
most
sour
ales
but
still
relatively
mild
in
that
department
and
a
moderately
long
lasting
flavor
in
the
finish
still
did
nothing
for
me
with
its
vinegary
qualities
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
fair
head
retention
and
lacing
the
beer
has
the
predictable
red
flanders
aroma
which
is
a
complex
aroma
of
cherry
raspberry
interspersed
wtih
lots
of
sour
from
brett
there
is
almost
a
sweet
fruity
camel
sweat
aroma
to
this
beer
the
beer
is
excellent
on
the
palate
there
is
a
hawaiian
fruit
punch
flavor
profile
but
with
just
the
right
amount
of
funky
sour
to
cut
through
the
punch
the
beer
is
not
particularly
heavy
and
finishes
well
a
nice
beer
though
nothing
spectacular
either
this
beer
poured
a
rich
ruby
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
you
can
immediately
smell
the
sour
cherries
with
the
taste
it
is
almost
similar
to
monks
flemish
sour
with
the
sour
cherries
pouring
through
as
well
as
a
strong
lactic
feel
it
does
have
its
bitter
moments
as
well
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
in
a
sense
if
you
were
only
to
drink
one
definitely
one
of
the
better
kriek
beers
that
i
have
had
pretty
drinkable
but
pretty
sweet
d
this
beer
is
certainly
one
to
wake
up
your
tastebuds
strong
cherry
flavour
and
the
sourness
ensures
that
the
drinker
doesnt
get
overwhelmed
by
its
sugary
sweetness
i
doubt
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
as
it
makes
for
a
much
better
sipping
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
though
good
representation
of
the
style
an
excellent
offering
from
verhaeghe
very
drinkable
and
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
the
store
where
i
got
this
is
very
much
an
undiscovered
gem
in
boise
very
big
polish
czech
and
russian
beer
selection
plus
a
bunch
of
germans
and
belgians
that
are
found
no
where
else
in
the
area
body
is
medium
slippery
and
loosely
carbonated
i
could
certainly
drink
this
en
mass
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
complex
and
sour
i
enjoy
this
and
would
drink
it
by
the
growler
sadly
this
is
the
last
bottle
ive
ever
seen
poured
into
a
chalice
a
deep
mahongny
color
awesome
carbonation
quick
fizzy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
tangy
malty
hints
of
cherriesraspberries
some
caramel
the
taste
is
tangymalty
nice
touch
of
red
fruit
and
caramel
this
is
a
highly
carbonated
brew
medium
body
drinkable
another
tasty
brew
from
bv
nice
beer
the
simple
commercial
description
does
actually
provide
a
succinct
description
those
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
and
blended
almost
if
not
a
session
beer
natural
great
finish
theres
a
very
nice
melding
of
the
fruit
oak
malt
and
yeast
no
hop
to
speak
of
normally
wouldnt
think
of
a
fruit
lambic
as
being
close
to
a
session
beer
but
this
is
fairly
light
not
cloying
easy
to
finish
the
11
2
oz
bottle
personally
i
still
prefer
the
depth
of
duchesse
over
this
but
the
cherry
adds
a
nice
fruit
character
overall
not
a
beer
for
which
one
should
cross
state
lines
but
for
goodness
sake
please
skip
the
fruit
syrup
lambics
for
this
one
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
seeking
a
good
sour
kriek
as
i
continue
to
drink
this
kriek
it
is
growing
on
me
still
wish
it
had
a
more
cherry
taste
but
good
none
the
less
i
will
buy
this
one
again
if
you
like
flemish
red
ales
this
is
good
but
not
excellent
on
the
continuum
the
pour
is
a
delightful
reddish
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
cherry
scent
to
tickle
the
palate
not
much
of
a
head
but
the
style
is
not
known
for
this
either
moderate
carbonation
nice
mouthfeel
nice
cherry
flavoring
but
this
isnt
a
rodenback
or
a
duchesse
this
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
for
the
style
some
interesting
spices
added
not
nearly
as
sour
as
it
could
be
and
a
little
too
cherry
sweet
lacking
that
soury
punch
needed
for
the
style
i
like
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
but
if
i
want
a
genuine
flemish
red
to
duchesse
and
rodenbach
i
will
venture
and
so
should
you
what
makes
this
beer
more
interesting
than
say
a
monks
is
those
delicious
spices
added
this
is
the
high
point
of
the
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
the
flemish
red
style
lchaim
notes
this
is
a
very
approachable
flanders
red
ale
its
got
enough
tartness
to
give
someone
an
idea
of
what
the
style
is
about
but
this
is
subtle
compared
to
most
that
ive
had
fairly
balanced
with
all
things
considered
and
the
yeast
strain
produced
some
unusual
but
good
complexity
reccomended
pours
a
three
finger
fizzy
redbrown
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
no
lace
deep
redamber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
sour
cherry
nose
starts
and
finishes
as
sour
cherries
there
is
some
sweetness
part
way
through
you
have
to
like
krieks
to
really
appreciate
this
pricey
at

this
might
work
as
a
nice
intro
to
the
style
for
some
but
for
me
its
just
a
little
bastard
sister
of
a
substitute
to
the
duchess
or
la
folie
this
is
a
different
one
it
has
moments
where
i
quite
like
it
then
some
where
id
rather
be
having
something
else
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
any
given
time
drinkability
not
for
me
drinkability
although
not
a
classic
flanders
red
this
is
an
enjoyable
fruit
beer
enough
depth
of
flavor
to
please
a
beer
lover
but
not
so
wild
as
to
turn
off
all
but
the
true
lambic
lovers
the
head
is
reddish
purple
the
color
is
purple
and
very
dark
the
lacing
isnt
very
strong
the
smell
is
fruity
and
sour
like
cherries
it
also
has
some
woody
tones
to
it
the
taste
is
sour
with
a
woody
flavor
and
a
fruity
cherry
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
cool
overall
this
was
very
good
i
would
have
another
drinkability
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
wish
more
domestic
breweries
would
take
a
shot
at
the
style
i
know
some
are
doing
it
but
its
about
time
more
start
the
style
for
me
is
a
treat
in
general
and
with
the
added
cherries
and
oak
again
and
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
a
very
interesting
color
depending
on
the
angle
and
light
it
seems
to
change
from
oak
brown
to
deep
cherry
red
to
pinkish
around
the
edges
first
impression
is
that
this
is
a
fizzy
cherry
soda
streams
of
carbonation
that
actually
pop
on
the
surface
you
can
smell
the
cherries
right
away
not
sweet
and
sugary
but
more
of
a
tart
and
sour
more
tartness
in
the
flavor
you
can
taste
the
fruitiness
but
also
the
sourness
as
expected
from
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
again
more
like
a
7up
or
carbonated
water
probably
not
the
best
example
but
now
i
have
a
benchmark
to
compare
other
flanderss
to
not
without
its
charm
but
i
dont
see
myself
craving
many
more
of
these
a
curious
style
and
one
that
i
can
fathom
would
be
best
enjoyed
while
paired
with
something
rather
than
on
its
own
aroma
is
both
sour
balsamic
and
sweet
and
sour
cherries
body
is
a
redtinted
brown
and
holds
a
diminishing
thumb
thick
pinkttinted
white
head
for
is
syrupy
sweet
cherries
and
a
dash
of
funky
fruit
mash
and
sourness
far
less
sour
than
other
flemish
sours
but
pretty
damn
funky
tasting
like
msg
laden
baby
corn
has
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twang
int
he
finish
that
doesnt
belong
but
not
a
bad
beer
really
d
the
first
sip
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
was
going
to
finish
this
beer
once
my
mouth
got
used
to
it
i
found
the
beer
quite
enjoyable
and
complex
a
favorate
from
now
on
the
beer
pours
a
very
pretty
pinkishred
the
smell
is
a
very
nice
candycherry
like
some
sort
of
hard
candy
the
taste
is
sweet
just
like
the
smell
there
is
little
hops
to
go
along
with
sweet
cherry
it
is
pretty
thin
and
goes
down
very
easily
for
a
beer
that
i
would
expect
to
sip
this
was
the
last
beer
served
on
sunday
night
as
part
of
the
monks
cafe
michael
jackson
dinner
and
what
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
this
beer
poured
a
nice
bright
slighly
deep
red
color
with
a
pinkish
head
and
good
lacing
the
nose
is
a
nice
warming
sour
cherry
sensation
very
enjoyable
to
my
nose
the
taste
is
a
very
sour
cherry
delight
with
a
bit
of
a
bready
taste
in
there
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
at
times
it
was
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
d
im
not
sure
that
i
would
classify
this
as
a
flanders
red
ale
doesnt
taste
like
any
that
i
have
tried
im
really
impressed
with
the
products
of
the
verhaeghe
brewery
however
this
is
my
least
favorite
so
far
its
still
good
but
im
much
rather
drink
duchesse
de
bourgogne
or
vichtenaar
pours
a
deep
red
with
red
foamy
head
very
tart
with
a
sweet
finish
and
a
cherry
everything
highly
carbonated
which
seemed
to
present
a
good
head
not
much
for
th
eoverwhelming
fruitiness
my
wife
liked
it
though
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
towering
pink
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
moderate
malty
scent
that
also
boasts
of
sour
cherries
its
mild
but
still
quite
enticing
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
a
wonderful
sour
cherry
finish
that
is
complimented
with
a
slight
oakey
touch
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
full
of
flavor
i
love
the
cherry
brews
their
tart
and
quite
enjoyable
out
of
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
red
pink
with
light
pink
very
rocky
head
smells
sour
tart
with
a
slight
funk
and
a
touch
of
tart
cherry
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
quick
tart
cherry
with
dry
finish
serious
bite
to
the
mouth
really
good
sampled
at
t
beertje
in
bruges
verhaeghe
echt
kriekenbier
may
be
the
quintessential
flanders
red
ale
for
all
i
know
if
so
then
i
dont
really
love
what
this
style
embodies
ill
keep
searching
though
in
the
hopes
that
i
run
across
one
that
will
rock
my
world
to
flanders
and
back
the
vichtenaar
was
an
excellent
brew
the
cherries
have
really
ruined
it
drinkability
i
liked
it
my
girlfriend
liked
it
but
there
are
beers
out
there
that
do
better
at
what
this
beer
attempts
a
pretty
good
cherry
belgian
beer
not
as
complex
rich
or
rounded
as
some
that
ive
sampled
but
well
brewed
nevertheless
good
tart
cherry
aromas
surrounded
by
solid
hints
of
red
wine
vinegar
and
citrusy
tartness
looks
ruby
red
almost
to
the
extent
of
carbonated
cranberry
juice
very
deep
and
clear
highly
carbonated
tastes
as
plesant
as
it
smells
tart
but
not
sour
enough
malt
character
to
sweeten
the
body
tartness
begins
to
edge
toward
vinegar
and
cider
but
not
enough
to
deter
fruity
cherry
for
an
extra
flavor
profile
but
not
overly
dominant
finishes
tart
and
dryquite
winelike
after
taste
is
a
solid
echo
of
cherries
just
delicious
d
this
is
a
very
soft
light
flanders
red
the
cherry
notes
are
very
mild
and
the
sourness
is
very
faint
it
is
well
blended
but
not
as
complex
with
the
malt
and
red
wine
characters
as
i
would
like
to
see
drinkability
and
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitly
room
for
improvement
for
the
style
this
one
falls
way
short
of
some
of
the
others
would
i
have
another
probably
would
i
prefer
it
probably
not
fairly
average
id
say
room
temperature
musty
and
leather
smell
very
cherry
light
head
opaque
red
sugar
and
vinegar
acidic
not
finishable
doesnt
work
altogether
the
taste
the
fizzy
carbonation
too
dry
too
thin
maybe
with
some
spicy
meat
this
is
a
fruit
beer
right
modiale
2005
11
2
ounce
bottle
pours
out
clear
red
with
a
pink
head
carbonation
is
very
fizzy
the
smell
hits
you
the
second
you
open
the
bottle
some
cherry
in
the
aroma
but
mostly
the
kind
of
aroma
you
would
get
from
a
strong
dark
belgian
ale
i
expected
this
beer
to
taste
very
malty
and
high
in
alcohol
taking
a
sip
is
a
big
suprise
the
taste
is
not
like
the
smell
the
cherry
flavor
is
nice
not
too
artificial
or
sweet
there
are
some
nice
malt
flavors
too
however
the
fruit
and
the
malt
flavors
do
not
complement
each
other
well
in
addition
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
without
a
focus
ok
i
guess
its
got
some
issues
but
its
passable
probably
moreso
than
the
dutchess
pours
a
pretty
translucent
red
color
with
no
head
smell
is
hard
to
discern
there
are
definitely
fruits
apparent
but
for
the
most
part
is
smells
like
sweet
alcohol
the
taste
is
surprising
the
first
gets
you
right
in
the
sweet
zone
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
sweet
cherries
as
it
goes
down
it
tastes
more
like
cherries
and
wheat
with
a
huge
amount
of
sweet
as
far
as
kriek
beers
go
it
is
a
great
representation
but
save
this
one
for
the
person
who
has
a
large
sweet
tooth
pretty
drinkable
i
could
have
another
one
of
these
sampled
at
the
southside
beer
expo
frankfort
illinois
cherry
red
body
with
a
thick
parfait
head
swirl
it
around
in
the
glass
like
its
a
melting
cherry
soda
float
a
refreshing
cherry
taste
that
isnt
cloying
in
sweetness
kind
of
missed
the
sourness
one
would
expect
in
a
flanders
but
to
each
its
own
drinkability
whatever
style
it
is
its
a
prefectly
decent
drinkable
brew
mouthfeel
is
thin
according
to
my
girlfriend
i
cant
disagree
but
i
dont
think
its
watery
like
some
just
ok
drinkability
i
just
dont
get
it
the
full
and
creamy
pink
head
atop
this
beautys
clear
ruby
body
is
an
indication
of
the
light
and
fruity
flavor
to
be
found
within
in
the
nose
tart
cherry
combines
with
lambiclike
characteristics
lactobacilus
brettanomyces
its
gently
effervescent
on
the
tongue
and
becomes
airy
as
it
crosses
the
palate
the
flavor
expresses
clear
sourcherry
and
lactic
character
over
a
sweetish
malt
the
bitterness
is
sublime
as
it
should
be
and
it
finishes
with
a
whisp
of
sweetness
that
fades
into
tartness
and
some
dry
chalkiness
quite
nice
my
girlfriend
loved
it
of
course
i
dont
believe
i
could
drink
more
that
2
of
these
not
due
to
the
alcohol
or
anything
negative
its
just
not
one
i
would
normally
choose
to
drink
beyond
a
pint
or
two
i
am
real
glad
this
was
a
surprise
send
by
cornboy
i
would
have
never
picked
this
one
up
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
brew
at
steelgaarden
below
bethlehem
brew
works
the
beer
is
served
in
a
8
oz
bottle
in
a
goblet
pours
a
clear
red
grape
color
with
a
small
frothy
pink
head
that
fades
to
a
minor
surface
layer
aroma
is
musty
and
sour
cherry
very
tart
overall
quite
enticing
first
sip
is
tart
and
sour
rather
puckering
on
my
lips
small
prickly
carbonation
is
carried
in
an
average
body
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
in
the
middle
and
finishes
dry
and
wooden
the
finish
leaves
a
tingle
on
my
gums
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
any
one
that
enjoys
tart
sour
brews
very
clear
deep
ruby
body
topped
off
with
a
pink
head
the
aroma
is
sour
wood
and
cherries
the
flavor
has
a
large
oak
aspect
the
cherry
is
there
but
something
in
this
one
is
very
medicinal
its
not
bad
and
actually
fairly
refreshing
but
that
medicinal
quality
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
annoying
a
sweet
beer
but
sweet
like
juice
especially
with
the
fairly
light
body
instead
of
rich
or
cloying
sweet
drinkability
not
for
me
decent
fruitiness
but
not
complex
its
not
a
sugarsyrup
so
that
wins
a
few
points
but
im
amazed
this
site
calls
it
a
flanders
as
it
is
more
a
tart
lindemans
lambfake
if
you
like
cherries
in
your
bier
seek
this
one
out
and
give
it
a
try
i
plan
to
stock
a
few
of
these
in
my
cellar
2
99
a
bottle
at
the
vintage
cellar
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
alltime
fruit
biers
thanks
to
glenn
owner
of
fatheads
for
a
sample
of
this
one
before
we
bought
it
and
for
carrying
it
on
tap
when
ive
never
even
seen
a
bottle
before
definitely
enjoyable
my
only
regret
is
that
the
cherry
could
have
added
to
the
sour
experience
of
the
beer
but
rather
ended
up
blocking
it
still
id
have
one
again
even
if
i
just
realized
i
was
drinking
a
reddishlooking
beer
from
a
snifter
in
a
bar
boy
do
i
miss
the
master
of
this
style
zottegems
oud
kriekenbier
echt
kriekenbier
has
the
chance
to
replace
this
but
fails
miserably
to
do
so
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
keep
waiting
until
the
day
that
brouwerij
bavik
decide
to
add
some
cherries
to
their
excellent
petrus
aged
pale
ale
one
day
we
shall
have
a
replacement
for
the
zottegemsi
keep
hoping
a
pretty
cheap
pick
up
at
kahns
in
indy
pours
a
ruby
red
with
a
whispypink
head
which
did
not
retain
as
well
as
i
wouldve
hoped
smell
has
strong
notes
of
vinegar
with
hints
of
cherry
and
barnyard
funk
first
taste
assuaged
my
initial
fears
that
this
beer
had
turned
very
strong
flavor
of
cherries
some
tartness
comes
through
at
the
end
but
its
not
intensely
sour
a
little
bit
of
wood
can
be
tasted
as
well
a
little
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
deparment
but
definetely
an
interesting
brew
worth
a
try
very
red
with
a
pink
head
this
beer
looks
like
it
might
be
a
sweet
lambic
but
it
is
instead
deep
dark
cherry
with
a
sour
smell
very
dry
sour
cherries
with
almost
no
sweetness
make
this
a
beer
that
you
love
or
hate
i
really
like
it
as
it
challenged
my
palate
and
tasted
like
some
brewer
cared
about
making
an
uncompromising
beer
that
is
remembered
long
after
this
beer
has
a
different
label
then
the
one
in
the
picture
but
it
seems
to
be
the
same
beer
from
what
i
read
as
i
was
pouring
a
giant
pink
fizzy
head
erupted
from
the
glass
with
audible
fizziness
atop
a
dark
cherry
colored
clear
body
after
the
head
fizzled
down
quickly
to
a
coating
of
bubbles
there
was
no
lace
left
about
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
slightly
sweet
cherries
and
also
quite
a
bit
of
tartness
very
sweet
cherry
flavor
here
similar
to
cherry
syrup
the
finish
is
tart
and
tangy
with
more
cherry
flavor
mouthfeel
here
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
over
carbonation
doesnt
help
either
i
can
see
being
in
the
mood
for
one
of
these
but
not
drinking
one
after
another
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
seek
out
more
of
the
style
thanks
cornboy
for
this
surprise
brew
blood
red
in
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
tart
cherries
quite
acidic
after
this
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
sugary
sweet
at
least
at
the
start
the
cherry
flavor
is
quite
present
yet
things
never
get
too
sweet
a
nice
hint
of
sour
at
the
finish
keeps
things
a
bit
balanced
theres
even
a
bit
of
malt
asserting
itself
once
the
beer
warms
a
bit
giving
the
whole
sip
a
bit
of
added
depth
overall
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
on
tap
at
coopers
seafood
house
in
scranton
looking
for
something
to
awaken
my
mouth
after
oysters
rockefeller
presented
in
a
goblet
the
beer
is
deep
red
with
a
thin
pink
foam
atop
the
smell
is
characteristically
sour
with
a
hint
of
cherry
the
fruit
is
secondary
to
the
vinous
alcohol
laced
yeasty
sourness
taste
is
tart
and
tangy
with
plenty
of
cherry
flavor
its
a
refreshing
tangy
almost
wild
beer
its
amazingly
refreshing
a
nice
reddish
colour
with
a
white
head
that
dies
quickly
this
smells
of
sweet
cherries
slight
lambic
funk
lactic
funk
sweet
malts
and
slightly
grassy
subtle
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
funky
and
very
cherryish
with
a
nice
creaminess
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
very
very
dry
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
interesting
kriekflanders
red
hybrid
that
i
could
see
trying
again

va
nkish
red
hue
surmounted
by
a
pink
offwhite
head
nice
nose
with
that
oak
cask
wood
thing
going
on
that
seduces
me
like
always
woody
with
weird
almost
smoky
notes
leafy
balsamic
vinegar
notes
and
of
course
an
honest
mostly
sweet
cherry
base
palate
is
balsamic
very
refreshing
oaky
vanilla
but
acidity
level
remains
low
enough
to
be
accessible
excellent
i
thought
goudenband
was
a
good
flemish
red
ale
but
this
is
much
better
maybe
because
its
not
really
a
flemish
red
ale
does
the
addition
of
cherries
make
it
no
longer
a
true
blue
flanderish
brew
whatever
it
tastes
damn
good
like
a
dollop
of
palette
cleansing
sorbet
after
a
spectacular
meal
a
deep
red
color
the
aroma
is
sour
with
note
of
vinegar
and
it
definitely
has
good
cherry
notes
to
it
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
dry
with
a
sour
cherry
character
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
fruity
but
not
at
all
cloying
with
a
nice
balancing
tartness
i
must
admit
im
not
too
versed
in
lambics
but
from
the
few
ive
had
echte
kriek
fits
in
nicely
good
to
try
pours
a
strawberry
tea
color
with
a
very
fizzy
pink
head
the
dissipates
rapidly
the
smell
is
somewhat
winelike
with
a
tart
grape
and
warming
alcohol
aroma
bilowing
from
the
glass
the
taste
starts
with
a
carb
bite
sliding
into
the
tart
fruit
and
warming
alcohol
and
ends
with
a
cranapple
type
of
bittersweet
finish
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
that
ends
on
a
lightly
sweet
note
this
could
go
wonderfully
with
certain
dishes
although
very
tasty
and
positive
in
every
other
way
the
drinkability
would
suffer
a
bit
because
a
little
goes
a
long
way
with
all
due
respect
thanks
to
belgianbum
for
the
chance
to
taste
such
a
beer
op
uw
gezonheid
drink
this
yes
again
and
again
and
again
and
after
this
and
the
vichtenaar
with
duchesse
de
bourgogne
already
established
as
my
favourite
beer
yes
indeed
i
think
verhaeghe
has
a
good
run
at
being
my
nomination
for
best
brewery
smell
is
a
souring
cherry
tinge
and
wild
oaky
sweetness
with
some
yeasty
meatlike
bacon
notes
taste
has
a
quick
hold
of
souring
cherry
substantially
biting
and
sweet
oakyness
with
a
nice
little
tart
kick
notes
of
yeasty
uncrisp
bacon
laying
on
the
side
of
the
oak
character
kinda
weird
but
nice
simple
and
pleasing
not
a
overbearing
cherry
fruitness
just
alot
of
cherry
character
in
the
sour
and
tart
areas
which
it
has
a
good
portion
of
pretty
full
feel
upfront
with
a
quickening
hit
of
souring
then
eases
out
and
finds
lots
of
tart
cherry
dryness
and
oaky
sweetness
a
pretty
decent
quite
powering
little
brew
a
pleasure
to
drink
another
thanks
goes
out
to
jeffboo
for
the
bottle
had
this
on
tap
at
the
gbbf
aswell
as
out
of
the
bottle
the
bottle
version
seem
ed
better
to
me
the
tapped
version
i
had
was
a
bit
flat
and
lifeless
no
fresh
sour
cherries
the
tap
version
was
also
a
lot
sweeter
i
found
still
has
the
stinkyness
meat
and
blood
of
the
bottled
version
but
the
palate
didnt
feel
the
same

ok
who
am
i
kidding
when
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
i
was
new
to
the
site
and
must
have
been
reviewing
in
comparison
to
other
sour
beers
eg
goudenband
and
comparitively
it
is
average
but
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
and
the
blend
of
sour
and
cherries
is
delightful
very
tasty
more
points
from
me
the
second
time
around
this
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
dark
brownish
red
with
a
largish
quickly
dissipating
pink
effervescent
head
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
the
smell
is
of
faint
sour
cherries
and
oak
the
taste
is
oak
mild
cherries
sweetness
offset
by
a
sour
acidity
this
is
a
very
oaky
acidic
pleasing
not
overly
fruit
beer
quite
nice
pours
a
blushwine
red
minimal
pink
head
fades
to
nothing
with
soft
carbonation
fizzing
up
very
little
aroma
gently
fruity
with
the
barest
hint
of
solvent
tartly
sweet
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
shifting
to
sour
cherry
as
the
fluid
moves
back
on
the
tongue
an
interesting
sensation
sourtart
nicely
balances
the
initial
sweetness
which
otherwise
would
be
cloying
i
had
this
as
an
afterdinner
drink
for
which
it
was
ideal
about
the
only
other
time
i
could
see
myself
wanting
this
beer
might
be
as
a
shady
sipper
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
a
versatile
beer
but
quite
pleasant
at
the
right
time
in
limited
quantity
a
brew
from
the
rare
beer
store
at
realbeer
com
this
one
pours
cherry
red
with
a
fizzy
pink
head
that
vanishes
like
one
on
a
soda
would
the
aroma
is
very
much
like
a
sour
cherry
soda
with
a
slight
woodiness
and
cherry
pits
it
has
a
fizzy
light
body
that
holds
tart
cherry
flavors
and
a
little
almond
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
it
finishes
very
dry
i
feel
that
it
probably
would
go
well
with
some
sweetrich
stews
made
with
pork
or
chicken
it
makes
a
better
addition
to
food
than
as
a
standalone
beer
imo
thanks
to
evan
for
the
sample
source
great
beers
of
belgium
the
beer
pours
an
opalescent
sanguineous
color
the
head
fair
in
size
frothy
in
texture
but
settles
quite
quickly
leaving
a
spindly
lace
behind
nose
is
sweet
and
sour
fruit
something
like
raspberries
and
ripe
bananas
light
hints
of
malt
and
not
unpleasant
front
is
malt
with
a
very
light
sweetness
but
the
sourness
of
a
flanders
red
ale
hits
the
palate
almost
immediately
the
top
is
cadaverous
the
finish
is
caustic
meagerly
hopped
the
aftertaste
bonedry
with
a
lingering
sourness
which
is
expected
in
this
style
i
must
admit
it
is
a
bit
thin
or
better
yet
watery
had
a
glass
of
this
at
the
brewery
originally
started
off
as
my
dads
beer
but
after
a
sip
he
couldnt
handle
the
sourness
i
didnt
mind
it
i
enjoyed
the
the
very
tart
cherry
flavors
and
the
mild
aroma
of
bourbon
and
alcohol
maybe
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
the
8oz
i
had
in
my
glass
was
just
right
mouth
is
med
bod
flemmy
mild
acidic
bite
decent
carb
o
a
good
flanders
though
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
over
carbonated
for
the
style
cost
14
99
for
a
750
ml
bottle
o
pretty
good
effort
i
would
like
to
try
a
more
recent
release
of
this
beer
good
representation
of
the
style
not
too
overwhelming
not
too
complex
and
rather
refreshing
this
is
a
solid
sour
that
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
department
and
im
glad
to
have
finally
gotten
around
to
trying
this
one
i
heard
comparisons
to
russian
rivers
supplication
here
but
i
just
dont
see
it
here
o
my
goodness
this
kept
my
mouth
watering
for
minutes
after
each
sip
like
it
was
tickling
the
inside
of
my
mouth
id
be
interested
to
try
this
fresh
but
i
have
to
say
im
glad
i
had
the
restraint
to
age
this
because
it
was
pretty
damn
good
solid
if
not
onenoted
tame
apricot
mouthwatering
juice
thats
what
this
should
have
called
it
thanks
taturbo
overall
better
than
i
expected
out
of
proportion
on
many
flavors
like
the
wine
barrel
really
a
nice
flavorful
cherryforward
wild
ale
flanders
red
eh
not
too
sure
about
that
o
610
sourness
good
sour
but
not
very
complex
some
sour
cherries
with
a
little
vinegar
and
thats
about
it
o
excellent
drinkability
and
fits
the
style
very
well
particularly
for
an
american
made
one
i
had
this
a
few
times
on
tap
as
well
a
year
or
so
before
this
was
bottled
and
the
sourness
has
definitely
been
kicked
up
a
notch
or
two
since
but
very
happy
to
see
the
oak
and
fruit
is
still
present
too
very
much
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
else
central
waters
does
with
their
sour
program
considering
this
was
their
first
entry
essentially
compared
to
fresh
ive
already
lost
so
much
woody
character
without
gaining
funk
that
i
dont
want
to
age
the
only
other
bottle
of
the
inaugural
batch
of
exodus
i
have
for
more
than
a
few
additional
months
just
to
doublecheck
my
single
data
point
of
aging
results
also
it
is
worth
repeating
that
ive
aged
this
one
at
refrigerator
temperature
higher
temperatures
will
have
changed
faster
than
this
overall
good
first
effort
of
the
style
not
at
new
glarus
level
by
any
means
yet
on
the
thinner
end
of
medium
bodied
with
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
thats
slightly
acetic
but
not
overly
harsh
decent
barrel
character
with
toasted
oak
and
vanilla
followed
by
tart
vinous
dark
fruit
and
acetic
vinegary
funk
slightly
lactic
with
a
nice
amount
of
puckering
sourness
but
its
a
bit
more
aceticsolvent
like
than
i
prefer
the
dark
fruit
notes
adds
some
needed
sweetness
but
it
could
use
some
more
balance
o
pretty
solid
beer
all
around
and
was
glad
to
finally
try
a
brew
from
central
waters
this
is
a
real
good
flemish
red
nice
and
tart
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
the
pour
is
orange
with
a
tall
white
head
strong
cherry
aroma
but
also
a
weird
salty
note
some
oak
a
bit
of
pineapple
straw
and
lemon
the
flavor
is
highly
acidic
the
cherry
character
is
not
quite
as
pronounced
mild
red
wine
vinegar
leather
and
some
citric
acidity
very
simnple
but
good
fuller
medium
body
mediumlighter
carb
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
a
really
nice
sour
beer
overall
although
the
cherry
did
become
a
little
sweet
after
a
while
feel
is
at
about
medium
with
a
great
amount
of
carb
that
kinda
pricks
the
mouth
nice
lactic
sourness
with
a
pucker
i
could
drink
this
all
night
happily
very
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
my
hats
off
to
you
central
waters
thanks
for
sending
it
over
send
more
o
the
sourness
overpowers
the
other
elements
that
should
be
going
on
cherries
oak
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
detrimental
to
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
other
than
that
its
not
bad
at
all
nice
first
try
at
sours
for
cw
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
murky
reddish
color
the
color
was
obviously
the
sideeffect
of
being
soaked
in
the
cherries
a
sour
cherry
aroma
permeates
the
air
giving
anticipation
for
the
cherry
notes
to
come
the
initial
taste
is
a
sour
cherry
flavor
that
certainly
awakens
the
sour
taste
buds
on
the
tongue
a
mild
oak
flavor
is
present
with
the
biscuit
notes
obvious
in
observing
the
texture
the
cherries
add
something
to
the
sour
flavor
of
this
beer
which
continues
to
the
sour
finish
though
released
in
winter
this
could
easily
be
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
summer
beer
overall
it
was
a
wonderful
sour
beer
by
cw
i
am
always
a
fan
the
thier
bers
and
this
is
no
exception
make
some
more
exodus
central
waters
o
just
okay
overall
certainly
a
noble
attempt
but
kind
of
monotonous
still
i
encourage
the
effort
and
still
adore
cw
keep
on
plugging
guys
ill
keep
on
drinking
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
solid
not
anything
amazing
and
a
bit
underwhelming
for
me
but
still
not
a
bad
offering
o
absolutely
fantastic
one
of
my
favorite
sours
and
its
also
impressive
that
this
was
their
first
attempt
if
you
can
get
some
got
this
beer
at
the
occupy
the
local
option
event
earlier
today
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
bit
of
white
head
it
dissipates
after
a
little
while
leaving
little
if
any
lacing
and
a
bit
of
film
and
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
has
lots
of
oak
with
some
nice
funk
a
bit
of
fruity
berryish
aroma
as
well
and
a
bit
of
vinegary
acid
flavor
has
more
oak
than
in
the
aroma
with
lots
of
fruit
some
nice
funk
and
a
bit
of
a
vinous
balsamic
quality
the
oak
is
almost
overwhelming
i
would
love
to
put
a
bottle
down
for
a
while
to
see
where
that
big
oak
character
goes
mouthfeel
is
lower
carbonation
than
i
would
have
wanted
but
it
is
dry
and
light
regardless
if
it
had
a
touch
more
carbonation
it
would
have
been
better
in
this
case
it
may
have
turned
out
better
to
not
have
read
the
label
clearly
being
a
fan
of
flanders
red
my
expectations
would
have
been
even
higher
however
the
beer
disappoints
the
style
but
is
fine
for
a
try
tonight
in
the
nose
the
familiar
door
county
cherries
used
famously
by
new
glarus
are
clearly
there
clear
sour
from
the
trifecta
of
sour
bugs
and
the
oak
is
there
if
you
look
for
it
take
a
taste
and
the
oak
is
now
out
front
with
a
pleasant
fruity
sourness
body
is
thin
and
seems
to
fall
off
the
back
with
little
to
stop
it
adequate
and
my
perception
of
central
waters
has
change
very
little
solid
but
rarely
stellar
o
well
the
barrel
wasnt
really
there
and
the
cherries
sort
of
got
muted
in
the
flavor
it
was
a
nice
take
on
the
flanders
but
overall
it
didnt
click
pours
a
pinkishred
color
with
minimal
amounts
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
funky
and
oaky
mildy
sour
and
vinegar
cherries
the
beer
has
a
punch
of
vinegar
tartness
while
managing
to
be
pretty
mild
and
drinkable
the
cherries
are
more
tart
than
they
come
off
as
a
big
cherry
flavor
the
funk
is
toned
down
for
sure
and
the
beer
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
complexity
that
said
what
it
does
it
does
nicely
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
undercarbonated
this
is
definitely
a
solid
attempt
would
love
to
try
an
aged
one
down
the
road
nice
work
cw
nice
flanders
red
from
central
waters
has
a
good
sour
cherry
aroma
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
sour
tartness
and
cherry
a
well
balanced
brew
that
is
like
the
little
brother
of
the
dissident
from
deschutes
i
think
the
recipe
could
be
beefed
up
a
bit
with
more
malt
and
cherries
the
bourbon
isnt
really
there
at
all
which
could
also
be
improved
this
beer
is
not
dissimilar
to
my
recollections
of
rodenbach
which
is
to
say
it
is
overly
dominated
by
sourness
for
my
tastes
on
the
whole
i
think
i
am
biased
towards
flanders
browns
i
think
this
one
could
be
aged
and
i
wish
i
had
more
than
1
bottle
d
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
a
really
nice
treat
to
try
light
carb
sticky
flavors
woody
nature
simple
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
hold
of
2
bottles
this
one
is
obviously
not
going
to
make
to
see
tomorrow
the
other
i
have
cellared
and
will
let
it
age
gracefully
for
a
year
or
two
before
letting
it
loose
overall
a
very
good
sour
ale
it
could
use
some
aging
to
bring
out
more
of
the
brett
funk
and
decrease
the
sweetness
just
a
little
bit
and
to
increase
the
carbonation
but
i
really
do
think
the
flavor
is
quite
good
edit
bottle
7312
developing
nicely
much
more
sour
and
carbonated
o
a
few
tweaks
and
this
could
be
an
absolutely
amazing
brew
the
sour
finish
does
a
great
job
of
tying
all
the
oak
and
cherries
together
with
the
bacteriafilled
brew
but
id
love
to
see
a
little
rise
in
the
flavor
profile
the
bugs
are
there
and
offer
low
underlying
complexity
but
almost
no
real
malt
profile
comes
though
in
this
one
regardless
this
is
damn
close
to
supplication
great
job
guys
i
cant
wait
to
age
some
bottles
and
experience
its
development
d
a
few
points
low
based
on
the
minimal
intake
received
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amberreddish
color
it
had
a
very
thick
off
white
head
that
was
about
3
fingers
tall
and
lingered
for
a
long
time
the
smell
was
very
much
bourbon
cherries
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
taste
was
surprisingly
smooth
up
front
was
a
lot
like
the
smell
a
lot
of
cherries
dark
fruit
oak
and
bourbon
the
finish
was
much
lighter
and
crisp
with
a
lighter
fruit
apple
pear
flavor
mouthfeel
was
really
not
what
i
expected
it
was
highly
carbonated
which
was
probably
why
the
head
was
so
high
but
very
light
and
easily
drinkable
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
and
i
would
love
to
see
them
bottle
this
one
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
to
try
it
i
would
highly
recommend
it
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
low
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
will
really
surprise
people
as
a
superior
first
sour
offering
from
central
waters
if
you
are
a
fan
of
oud
bruins
this
one
should
be
on
your
radar
draft
at
the
great
taste
pours
a
rust
mahagony
color
with
a
nicely
formed
white
tan
head
the
nose
is
way
more
sour
and
tart
fruit
notes
than
i
expected
cw
really
have
outdone
themselves
on
this
one
and
was
a
bit
surprising
to
say
the
least
some
malty
type
flavors
up
front
followed
by
the
full
force
hit
of
the
cherries
that
impart
both
a
sweet
and
sourtart
taste
to
the
beer
light
mouthfeel
overall
a
fairly
good
sour
that
ranks
pretty
well
but
still
needs
a
little
time
to
fully
develop
overall
a
decent
sour
but
it
needs
work
rumors
are
they
might
bottle
this
which
would
be
pretty
cool
fairly
drinkable
overall
wish
there
was
a
lot
more
brett
in
this
beer
but
still
enjoyable
cool
but
inconsistent
beer
different
every
time
i
try
it
and
this
latest
batch
may
have
been
the
least
impressive
of
the
lot
its
murky
amber
in
color
almost
flat
from
the
tap
with
a
foot
smelling
funk
that
shows
weird
sour
mashing
a
little
off
and
an
overall
weirdness
to
it
definitely
a
wild
ale
but
just
so
much
funk
gym
socky
and
sweaty
and
unsettling
a
little
in
the
stomach
i
remember
it
differently
though
as
an
excellent
flanders
red
vinegary
and
fuller
bodied
with
a
lot
of
rich
caramel
grain
character
it
has
always
been
like
that
but
the
funk
seems
way
higher
than
the
lacto
part
now
and
like
some
of
those
spontaneous
overpriced
italian
wilds
this
one
is
unfamiliar
in
a
way
im
not
sure
i
like
backyard
bucket
type
beer
maybe
batch
variance
is
intentional
but
i
liked
previous
editions
far
more
than
this
latest
brew
dark
gold
color
with
a
thin
and
quick
to
vanish
head
i
like
my
flemish
reds
more
red
smells
more
like
strawberries
rather
than
cherries
theres
a
nice
wet
straw
rustic
tone
that
carries
from
the
aroma
into
the
flavor
flavor
is
a
again
more
strawberries
than
cherry
not
nearly
tart
enough
a
tribute
to
the
renowned
greg
noonan
poured
into
a
snifter
a
hazy
rusty

color
with
a
fizzly
shortlived
white
head
aroma
of
grass
white
wine
tart
berries
with
a
touch
of
brett
funk
taste
followed
the
aroma
this
beer
wasnt
overly
fruity
but
there
was
a
definite
berry
tartness
to
it
lightly
sour
a
bit
of
grassy
barnyard
funk
nothing
too
extreme
or
too
hard
on
the

a

with
a
wisp

was
gone

i
knew

with

up

quickly

medium

a
crisp

not

pretty
good
nice
to
drink
when
im
out
taste

very
good

and
tart
and
lots
of
acidic
and
funky
flavors
throughout
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
sharp
finish
carbonation
seemed
low
for
the
style
and
detracted
from
what
probably
should
have
been
a
crisper
cleaner
experience
decent
but
certainly
not
outstanding
pours
a

when

across
as

to
be

this
beer
took
a

to
grow
on

and
was

opened
up
after
time
exposed
to
air
and
warmth
most
of
the
time
i
spent
wondering
how
bland
this
was

medium
red
colour
a
little

a
good
mouthfeel
for
the
style
as
they
added
significant
malt
this
also
served
to
take
down
the
sourness
from
what
i
would
have
expected
a
nice
beerno
poems
to
be
written
about
it
i
enjoyed
it
and
found
it
good
drinkability
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brett
beer
but
not
much
of
a
flanders
a
good
experiment
though
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
always
nice
to
go
into
a
brewpub
and
see
theyre
trying
something
different
while
i
honestly
hate
to
rip
on
any
beer
made
in
tribute
to
greg
noonan
and
especially
one
made
at
the
vpb
but
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
really
boring
i
mean
i
liked
the
look
and
feel
here
and
it
seemed
like
a
flemish
red
to
me
and
i
could
pick
up
the
brett
flavors
but
this
overall
just
didnt
pull
together
like
i
would
have
hoped
for
even
my
wife
who
is
a
big
fan
of
tartsour
beers
repeatedly
remarked
me
to
how
bland
this
seemed
considering
the
description
it
was
unfortunately
a
chore
to
get
through
the
glass
ah
well
a
fitting
tribute
to
the
man
greg
noonan
you
must
have
one
in
his
honor
winey
funky
sour
red
and
oaky
what
more
could
you
want
serving
type
bottle
o
bracingly
sour
so
good
additionally
ive
considered
that
my
review
here
might
be
a
bit
biased
due
to
my
new
love
for
brandon
jones
and
his
contribution
to
the
craft
world
however
those
thoughts
vanished
when
the
nice
fellows
around
me
shared
the
same
appreciation
for
this
beer
overall
this
beer
was
just
fantastic
i
cant
get
over
how
complex
the
taste
was
yazoo
really
outdid
themselves
with
this
beer
glad
i
have
more
bottles
and
im
already
looking
forward
to
next
years
release
o
this
beer
is
hitting
right
where
my
sourness
threshold
stands
presently
and
its

border
of
being
tonguenumbingly
sour

still
